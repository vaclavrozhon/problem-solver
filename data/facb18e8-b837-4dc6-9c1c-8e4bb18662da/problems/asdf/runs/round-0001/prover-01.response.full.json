Then |A + B| \u2265 |A| + |B| \u2212 1.\\n\\nProof.\\nWrite A = {a1 < \u2026 < am}, B = {b1 < \u2026 < bn}. Consider the m + n \u2212 1 sums\\nS = {a1 + b1, a1 + b2, \u2026, a1 + bn, a2 + bn, a3 + bn, \u2026, am + bn}.\\nWithin each of the two subsequences, sums strictly increase. Also, a2 + bn > a1 + bn, so all m + n \u2212 1 displayed sums are pairwise distinct. Hence |A + B| \u2265 |S| = m + n \u2212 1. \u220e\\n\\nProposition 2 (Equality case in Z)\\nWith A, B as above, equality |A + B| = |A| + |B| \u2212 1 holds if and only if A and B are arithmetic progressions with a common difference.\\n\\nProof.\\nThe \u201cif\u201d direction is clear: sums of two APs with the same common difference form an AP of length |A| + |B| \u2212 1.\\nFor \u201conly if,\u201d suppose equality holds. Then the set A + B is exactly S from the proof above; in particular, no \u201cinterior\u201d sum a_i + b_j with 2 \u2264 i \u2264 m and 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n \u2212 1 can be new. Thus for each such (i, j) we must have a_i + b_j = a_{i\u22121} + b_{j+1}. Hence a_i \u2212 a_{i\u22121} = b_{j+1} \u2212 b_j. Fixing j = 1 yields a_i \u2212 a_{i\u22121} = b_2 \u2212 b_1 for all 2 \u2264 i \u2264 m, so A is an AP with difference d := b_2 \u2212 b_1. Fixing i = 2 yields b_{j+1} \u2212 b_j = a_2 \u2212 a_1 = d for all 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n \u2212 1, so B is an AP with the same difference. \u220e\\n\\nRemark. Proposition 2 can be seen as a 2k \u2212 1 case of Freiman-type structure in Z.\\n\\nProposition 3 (Prime cyclic group, two-point B)\\nLet p be prime, A \u2286 Z/pZ finite and nonempty, and let B = {x, x + d} with d \u2260 0. Then\\n- Cauchy\u2013Davenport gives |A + B| \u2265 min(p, |A| + |B| \u2212 1) = min(p, |A| + 1).\\n- If |A + B| = |A| + 1 < p, then A is a non-wrapping arithmetic progression with common difference d, i.e., A = {a, a + d, \u2026, a + (|A| \u2212 1)d}.\\n\\nProof.\\nBy translation, assume x = 0, so B = {0, d}. Then A + B = A \u222a (A + d), and\\n|A + B| = |A| + |A + d| \u2212 |A \u2229 (A + d)| = 2|A| \u2212 |A \u2229 (A + d)|.\\nIf |A + B| = |A| + 1 < p, then |A \u2229 (A + d)| = |A| \u2212 1.\\nConsider the directed cycle on Z/pZ with edges y \u2192 y + d. The number of edges with both endpoints in A is |A \u2229 (A + d)|. In the subgraph induced by A, each component is a directed path (since cycles would require |A| = p). The number of edges in a disjoint union of paths on m vertices equals m minus the number of path components. Hence |A \u2229 (A + d)| \u2264 |A| \u2212 1, with equality if and only if the induced subgraph is a single path. This means A consists of |A| consecutive vertices along the d-edges, i.e., an arithmetic progression with common difference d and no wrap-around. \u220e\\n\\nExamples\\n\\n- Tightness in Z: A = {0, 3, 7}, B = {1, 4}. Then |A + B| = 5 = |A| + |B| \u2212 1; A and B are APs with common difference 3.\\n- Composite modulus shows need for periodicity: In Z/6Z let A = {0, 3}, B = {0, 3}. Then A + B = {0, 3} has size 2, but |A| + |B| \u2212 1 = 3. This illustrates failure of the integer lower bound in groups with nontrivial stabilizers (here H = {0, 3}). Kneser\u2019s theorem predicts |A + B| \u2265 |A| + |B| \u2212 |H| = 2, with equality here.\\n\\nObstacles and context\\n\\n- For general A, B \u2286 Z/pZ with |A + B| = |A| + |B| \u2212 1 < p, the full equality characterization is Vosper\u2019s theorem: both are arithmetic progressions with a common difference. Proving this in full requires more machinery (e.g., Dyson\u2019s transform, isoperimetry, or Hamidoune\u2019s methods).\\n- For general abelian groups, Kneser\u2019s theorem governs the role of the stabilizer H of A + B: |A + B| \u2265 |A| + |B| \u2212 |H|, with equality cases structured by periodicity. Our examples show the necessity of |H|.\\n\\nNext steps\\n\\n- Prove Cauchy\u2013Davenport rigorously (e.g., Dyson\u2019s transform or the polynomial method) for completeness.\\n- Extend Proposition 3 to |B| = 3 in Z/pZ and characterize near-equality.\\n- Introduce Kneser\u2019s theorem and prove selected special cases (e.g., when A + B is aperiodic) to bridge integer and cyclic settings.\\n- Begin stability: quantify how close to an AP A and B must be if |A + B| \u2264 |A| + |B| \u2212 1 + \u03b5 min(|A|, |B|).\\n\\nChecks the verifier can run\\n\\n- Reproduce the proof of Lemma 1 and Proposition 2; test on random finite A, B in Z by computing |A + B| and verifying equality characterizations numerically for small cases.\\n- In Z/pZ, test Proposition 3 by enumerating A, d, and checking that |A + {0, d}| = |A| + 1 occurs precisely for non-wrapping d-progressions.\\n\\nPotential literature pointers (for future rounds)\\n\\n- Tao & Vu, Additive Combinatorics, for Cauchy\u2013Davenport, Vosper, and Kneser.\\n- Hamidoune\u2019s isoperimetric method for additive number theory.\\n- Dyson\u2019s transform for sumsets in Z/pZ.\\n\"\n}",
