Status and goal.
- The complexity of 3-coloring circle graphs remains open (Unger’s claimed O(n log n) algorithm was refuted by Bachmann–Rutter–Stumpf). For k ≥ 4, k-coloring circle graphs is NP-complete.
- We extract structural lemmas tailored to 3-coloring and design a polynomial-time algorithm for a nontrivial subclass. This gives auditable steps and concrete subproblems.

Ideas.
- Use a chord x as a separator. Removing the endpoints of x splits the circle into two arcs; every chord either lies entirely on one arc or crosses x. The neighbor set N(x) of chords crossing x forms a permutation graph. Vertices on the left/right arcs form induced circle graphs L and R with no edges between L and R.
- In any 3-coloring, if x gets color c, then N(x) must be 2-colored with the remaining two colors. Moreover, for y in L, which of the two non-c colors are forbidden depends only on which colored endpoints of N(x) fall into the interval between y’s endpoints on the corresponding side arc.
- If L and R are both bipartite, the side-extension problem from a fixed 2-coloring of N(x) becomes easy componentwise; we give a correct polynomial-time algorithm in this case. This yields a new XP/FPT-flavored approach parameterized by the number of connected components of G[N(x)].

Rigorous lemmas and proofs.

Lemma 1 (Permutation subgraph). Let G be a circle graph given by a chord diagram on a circle. Fix a chord x with endpoints s, t. Let N(x) be the set of chords intersecting x. Then G[N(x)] is a permutation graph; a permutation representation can be read off from the circular order of endpoints.
Proof. Removing s,t splits the circle into two open arcs A_L=(s,t) and A_R=(t,s). Each chord z ∈ N(x) has exactly one endpoint on A_L and one on A_R. Place the points of A_L and A_R on two parallel lines in their circular orders. Map z to the straight segment connecting its endpoint on the top line (A_L) to its endpoint on the bottom line (A_R). Two chords z,z′ in N(x) intersect iff the order of their endpoints is reversed between A_L and A_R, i.e., the two segments cross. That is exactly the defining property of permutation graphs.

Lemma 2 (Neighborhood bipartiteness is necessary). If G is 3-colorable, then for every vertex v, G[N(v)] is bipartite.
Proof. In a 3-coloring with colors {1,2,3}, suppose v has color 1. Every neighbor of v must be colored 2 or 3. Hence G[N(v)] admits a proper 2-coloring with colors {2,3}; thus it is bipartite.

Lemma 3 (Interface via endpoints on one side). With notation as above, fix a color assignment of N(x) using colors a,b ∈ {1,2,3} \ {c_x}. For y ∈ L (i.e., both endpoints on A_L), define u_z to be the endpoint of z ∈ N(x) on A_L. Then y is adjacent to z iff u_z lies strictly between the two endpoints of y along A_L. Consequently, the set of colors forbidden to y coming from N(x) is exactly the subset of {a,b} that appears among the colors assigned to u_z with u_z in the A_L-interval of y. An analogous statement holds for R using A_R.
Proof. For z ∈ N(x), its two endpoints lie on different arcs; say u_z ∈ A_L and the other endpoint v_z ∈ A_R. For y with endpoints y_1,y_2 ∈ A_L, the chords y and z cross iff their endpoints alternate around the circle, which here is equivalent to u_z lying strictly between y_1 and y_2 along A_L. Since z’s color is determined globally and y is adjacent to z exactly in this case, the set of forbidden non-c_x colors for y is exactly the set of colors seen among such u_z. The R-case is symmetric.

Algorithmic consequence: the bipartite-sides case.

Setup. Fix a chord x with color c_x. Assume both side subgraphs L (chords with both endpoints in A_L) and R (both endpoints in A_R) are bipartite. Also, by Lemma 2, if G is 3-colorable then G[N(x)] must be bipartite; hence we require it.

We show that under these conditions one can decide 3-colorability in polynomial time given a fixed 2-coloring of G[N(x)] (and thus after considering at most 2^{cc(N(x))} choices over its connected components). The key is a clean side-extension test for L and R.

Proposition 4 (Side extension test in polynomial time). Let H be a bipartite graph (here H = L or H = R). Let a,b be the two colors used on N(x), and c_x the third color. For each vertex y ∈ H, define S(y) ⊆ {a,b} as in Lemma 3: S(y) is the set of non-c_x colors that are forbidden to y by precolored neighbors in N(x). Then there exists a proper coloring of H with colors from {c_x} ∪ ({a,b} \ S(y)) for each y iff for every connected component C of H, at least one of its two bipartition-orientations produces an independent set of “violators” B_o(C), where B_o(C) := { y ∈ C : the a/b color assigned to y by orientation o is not in {a,b} \ S(y) }.
Moreover, when such an orientation o exists, coloring all vertices of B_o(C) with c_x and the remaining vertices according to orientation o yields a proper coloring of C.
Proof. Let (P,Q) be a bipartition of C. There are exactly two ways to 2-color C with colors {a,b}: o_1 maps P→a, Q→b and o_2 maps P→b, Q→a. For a given orientation o, any y ∈ C that cannot use its prescribed a/b color must instead use c_x; these are the “violators” B_o(C). If B_o(C) is not independent, two adjacent vertices would both be colored c_x, which is forbidden; hence orientation o is invalid. Conversely, if B_o(C) is independent, then the coloring that assigns c_x to B_o(C) and assigns the a/b color prescribed by o to the rest is proper: edges with both endpoints outside B_o(C) are properly a/b 2-colored by construction; any edge with exactly one endpoint in B_o(C) has distinct colors c_x vs a or b; and edges cannot have both endpoints in B_o(C) because B_o(C) is independent. This proves the characterization.

Corollary 5 (Algorithm under bipartite sides). Fix x. If G[N(x)], L, and R are bipartite, then 3-colorability of G can be decided as follows.
- For each of the 3 choices of c_x and for each of the 2^{cc(N(x))} choices of 2-colorings of the connected components of G[N(x)]:
  1) Compute S(y) for all y ∈ L and all y ∈ R (Lemma 3) in total O(n + m) time per choice using prefix data structures on the circular order.
  2) For each side H ∈ {L,R}, for each connected component C of H, test the two orientations o and o′, compute B_o(C), B_{o′}(C), and check independence in C (linear in |C|). If both orientations are invalid for some C, reject this choice; otherwise pick any valid one and color C accordingly.
  3) If both sides succeed, extend with the chosen 2-coloring of N(x) and color c_x on x, obtaining a valid 3-coloring of G.
If any choice succeeds, G is 3-colorable; otherwise, not.
Complexity. For a fixed x, this is O(3 · 2^{cc(N(x))} · poly(n)). Trying all x multiplies by n. If cc(N(x)) is bounded by a constant (e.g., if G[N(x)] is connected), this is polynomial time.
Correctness. Necessity of bipartiteness of G[N(x)] is Lemma 2. Given a fixed 2-coloring of N(x), Lemma 3 yields correct lists S(·) on each side. Proposition 4 ensures that the side coloring exists iff every component passes the orientation test; because L and R are disjoint and there are no edges between them, side solutions combine consistently. Edges inside N(x) are proper by construction, and edges between N(x) and L ∪ R are proper by the definition of S(·).

Examples and quick checks.
- Example 1 (A quick NO certificate via N(x)). Place x with endpoints at 0° and 180°. Choose three chords whose endpoints on A_L are in order a1<a2<a3 and on A_R in order b3<b2<b1; these three pairwise cross, forming a triangle in G[N(x)]. Then G is not 3-colorable (for any color of x, N(x) would have to be 2-colored), and the algorithm rejects immediately because G[N(x)] is not bipartite.
- Example 2 (Nontrivial yes with bipartite sides). Let x as above. Let N(x) form a path on 4 vertices (a permutation graph that is bipartite and connected). Construct L and R so that each is a disjoint union of paths and even cycles. For either of the two 2-colorings of N(x), the S(·) sets can be computed; each component C of L and R passes the orientation test (one of the two orientations gives an independent set B_o(C)). The algorithm accepts.

Obstacles and what failed.
- Extending beyond bipartite sides. If L or R contains an odd cycle, we must select some vertices on that side to take color c_x to break all odd cycles (an odd cycle transversal X), and X must be independent (to avoid assigning c_x to adjacent vertices). This becomes: find an independent odd cycle transversal with additional list-2-coloring constraints for the remainder—this resembles the odd cycle transversal problem augmented with independence constraints. We do not currently know a polynomial-time algorithm for that on circle graphs; OCT is NP-hard in general and remains hard on many geometric graph classes. Thus our present algorithm is restricted to bipartite sides.
- Global condition “G[N(v)] bipartite for all v” is necessary but far from sufficient for 3-colorability (e.g., Mycielski graphs have independent neighborhoods yet may require ≥4 colors; there also exist triangle-free circle graphs of chromatic number 5 due to Ageev). Hence such local checks are not decisive by themselves.

Next steps (concrete, testable).
1) Strengthen the side condition. Try to replace “L and R are bipartite” by “each component of L and R has odd cycle transversal of size at most t,” handled by branching on the t vertices (independent-set constraint enforced along the way). This yields an FPT algorithm parameterized by t + cc(N(x)). The key subroutine to prove: given a fixed small set X per component (guessed), the extension check reduces to Proposition 4.
2) Two-chord separators. Generalize the decomposition by using two chords x,y, classifying vertices by which of {x,y} they cross. The middle layer N(x) ∩ N(y) is a permutation graph; the four side regions are circle graphs with sparser interfaces. Derive an extension test akin to Proposition 4 with four sides, still driven by endpoint-presence summaries (Lemma 3 generalizes to each interface arc).
3) Empirical falsification. Implement the bipartite-sides algorithm and a heuristic search over chords x in random and adversarial circle graphs. Measure how often a chord with bipartite sides exists in 3-colorable and non-3-colorable instances; attempt to construct explicit counterexamples where no such chord exists despite 3-colorability.
4) Tight 2-SAT encoding exploration. For bipartite sides, attempt to encode the orientation choice per side component together with the 2-coloring choice per N(x)-component into a single 2-SAT instance that avoids the 2^{cc(N(x))} factor.
5) Literature cross-check. Verify whether odd cycle transversal (or independent OCT) is polynomial on circle graphs. If yes, it would remove the bipartite-sides restriction.

Summary of contributions.
- Structural: N(x) induces a permutation graph; in any 3-coloring, N(x) is 2-colored (Lemma 2). The constraint from N(x) to a side H is summarized purely by presence-of-color among endpoints within each y-interval on the side arc (Lemma 3).
- Algorithmic: If some chord x has both sides bipartite, 3-colorability reduces to at most 3·2^{cc(N(x))} side-extension checks, each decided in polynomial time (Proposition 4). This yields a polynomial-time algorithm whenever cc(N(x)) is bounded (e.g., N(x) connected), and provides a concrete parameterized foothold on the general problem.
- Obstacles: Extending beyond bipartite sides leads to an independent odd cycle transversal with list constraints; its complexity on circle graphs is presently unclear.
