This round consolidated structural and algorithmic progress on 3-coloring circle graphs. Representation: cutting the circle yields open intervals where chords cross iff intervals overlap without containment. Local structure: for any chord x, G[N(x)] is a permutation graph (hence must be bipartite in any 3-coloring); likewise N(x)∩N(y) is permutation (hereditary). Algorithmic results: a sweep-line DP parameterized by interval ply w decides k-colorability in O(n·w·k^w) time and O(k^w) space. A bipartite-sides extension test fixes x and a 2-coloring of components of N(x); if both side-subgraphs are bipartite, extendability can be tested in polynomial time, yielding an overall factor 2^{cc(N(x))} per choice. Limits: local conditions are far from sufficient (Ageev’s triangle-free χ=5 examples), ply can be Θ(n), and previous trapezoid claims were replaced by hereditary-permutation facts.
