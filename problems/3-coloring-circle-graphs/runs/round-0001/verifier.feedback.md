Overall, the three submissions are coherent and largely correct, and they collectively deliver two concrete, verifiable contributions: (i) the neighborhood structure N(x) is a permutation graph (with immediate algorithmic consequences), and (ii) an FPT algorithm for k-colorability of circle graphs parameterized by the interval ply w of a given chord/interval representation, with explicit DP and correctness arguments. In addition, Prover 3 proposes a sound side-extension test that yields polynomial-time solvability under a bipartite-sides assumption, with an FPT factor 2^{cc(N(x))} for the number of components of N(x).

Key audits and fixes:
- Lemma on N(x): Correct, standard, and the proofs are fine. Consequence: N(x) is bipartite in any 3-coloring, so this necessary condition can be tested efficiently, but is not sufficient.
- “Double neighborhoods are trapezoid graphs” (Prover 1): This is unnecessarily weak and the proof sketch is not rigorous. Since N(x) is a permutation graph and permutation graphs are hereditary, N(x)∩N(y) is again a permutation graph. Please revise to this tighter, simpler statement (and drop the trapezoid mapping unless you give a complete construction).
- DP by ply w (Provers 1–2): The state transitions and correctness invariants are sound. Complexity bounds are fine; Prover 1’s O(n·3^w) implicitly hides an O(w) per step factor unless you maintain color summaries; Prover 2’s O(n·w·3^w) is safe. Note that w is representation-dependent; recognize explicitly that the FPT guarantee is with respect to the ply of the given (or computed) representation, which may not be minimal for the graph.
- Structural remarks (Prover 2): The Helly-based characterization of cliques as antichains among intervals covering a point is correct. Claims about permutation graphs’ polynomial-time colorability are fine; avoid relying on perfection unless needed.
- Bipartite-sides algorithm (Prover 3): The interface lemma (adjacency determined by presence of precolored endpoints in the side interval) is correct, and Proposition 4 is sound. The algorithm is correct under the stated assumptions and yields polytime if cc(N(x)) is bounded and both sides are bipartite. Please make explicit that you must try all choices of x and 2-colorings of N(x)’s components, and that failure for one x does not preclude success for another.

Concrete next steps:
- Consolidate DP: unify into a single theorem (k-colorability FPT in ply w) with a clean, fully detailed proof and an implementation plan. Provide careful parameter statement: on input either a chord representation or a graph with a computed representation, running time f(w)·poly(n).
- Replace Lemma B by the hereditary-permutation observation and, if desired, add a clean proof that N(x)∩N(y) is permutation.
- For the bipartite-sides approach, formalize the 2-SAT encoding to remove the 2^{cc(N(x))} factor, if possible. Otherwise, generalize to “small independent odd cycle transversal per side” with branching (parameter t + cc(N(x))).
- Empirical: implement both algorithms; measure typical ply and frequency of chords with bipartite sides.
- Hardness direction: work on K4-free circle-graph gadgets (wires/equality/NAE constraints) respecting chord realizability.
