Verified: (1) N(x) induces a permutation graph; (2) an FPT DP for k-colorability parameterized by the interval ply w of a given representation, running in O(n·w·k^w). Added a rigorous side-extension test that yields polytime under a bipartite-sides assumption with an FPT factor 2^{cc(N(x))}. Corrected a shaky “trapezoid” claim to the tighter hereditary permutation fact. Next: unify DP proofs, clarify parameterization, and pursue 2-SAT compression and two-chord separator decompositions; start hardness gadget search.
