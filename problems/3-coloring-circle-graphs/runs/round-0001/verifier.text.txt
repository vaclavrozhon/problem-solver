{"feedback_md":"Overall, the three submissions are coherent and largely correct, and they collectively deliver two concrete, verifiable contributions: (i) the neighborhood structure N(x) is a permutation graph (with immediate algorithmic consequences), and (ii) an FPT algorithm for k-colorability of circle graphs parameterized by the interval ply w of a given chord/interval representation, with explicit DP and correctness arguments. In addition, Prover 3 proposes a sound side-extension test that yields polynomial-time solvability under a bipartite-sides assumption, with an FPT factor 2^{cc(N(x))} for the number of components of N(x).\n\nKey audits and fixes:\n- Lemma on N(x): Correct, standard, and the proofs are fine. Consequence: N(x) is bipartite in any 3-coloring, so this necessary condition can be tested efficiently, but is not sufficient.\n- “Double neighborhoods are trapezoid graphs” (Prover 1): This is unnecessarily weak and the proof sketch is not rigorous. Since N(x) is a permutation graph and permutation graphs are hereditary, N(x)∩N(y) is again a permutation graph. Please revise to this tighter, simpler statement (and drop the trapezoid mapping unless you give a complete construction).\n- DP by ply w (Provers 1–2): The state transitions and correctness invariants are sound. Complexity bounds are fine; Prover 1’s O(n·3^w) implicitly hides an O(w) per step factor unless you maintain color summaries; Prover 2’s O(n·w·3^w) is safe. Note that w is representation-dependent; recognize explicitly that the FPT guarantee is with respect to the ply of the given (or computed) representation, which may not be minimal for the graph.\n- Structural remarks (Prover 2): The Helly-based characterization of cliques as antichains among intervals covering a point is correct. Claims about permutation graphs’ polynomial-time colorability are fine; avoid relying on perfection unless needed.\n- Bipartite-sides algorithm (Prover 3): The interface lemma (adjacency determined by presence of precolored endpoints in the side interval) is correct, and Proposition 4 is sound. The algorithm is correct under the stated assumptions and yields polytime if cc(N(x)) is bounded and both sides are bipartite. Please make explicit that you must try all choices of x and 2-colorings of N(x)’s components, and that failure for one x does not preclude success for another.\n\nConcrete next steps:\n- Consolidate DP: unify into a single theorem (k-colorability FPT in ply w) with a clean, fully detailed proof and an implementation plan. Provide careful parameter statement: on input either a chord representation or a graph with a computed representation, running time f(w)·poly(n).\n- Replace Lemma B by the hereditary-permutation observation and, if desired, add a clean proof that N(x)∩N(y) is permutation.\n- For the bipartite-sides approach, formalize the 2-SAT encoding to remove the 2^{cc(N(x))} factor, if possible. Otherwise, generalize to “small independent odd cycle transversal per side” with branching (parameter t + cc(N(x))).\n- Empirical: implement both algorithms; measure typical ply and frequency of chords with bipartite sides.\n- Hardness direction: work on K4-free circle-graph gadgets (wires/equality/NAE constraints) respecting chord realizability.\n","summary_md":"Verified: (1) N(x) induces a permutation graph; (2) an FPT DP for k-colorability parameterized by the interval ply w of a given representation, running in O(n·w·k^w).

Decide the complexity of 3-coloring circle graphs (intersection graphs of chords of a circle). Unger’s O(n log n) algorithm was refuted (Bachmann–Rutter–Stumpf). For k ≥ 4, k-coloring circle graphs is NP-complete.\n\nKey observations consolidated this round:\n- Representation: Cutting the circle away from endpoints turns chords into open intervals (s(x), t(x)) with x,y adjacent iff their intervals overlap without containment: s(x) < s(y) < t(x) < t(y) or vice versa.\n- Neighborhood structure: For any chord x, N(x) induces a permutation graph: neighbors of x have one endpoint on each side arc; adjacency among them is determined by inversion between the two side orders. Consequently, in any 3-coloring N(x) must be bipartite.\n- Two-chord view: For any x,y, the set N(x)∩N(y) is an induced subgraph of N(x) and hence also a permutation graph (permutation graphs are hereditary). This tightens and replaces a tentative “trapezoid” claim.\n\nParameterized algorithm (ply w):\n- Define the interval ply w as the maximum number of intervals covering a point in the linearized representation. A sweep-line DP over the 2n endpoints maintains proper colorings of the active set; on the start of b, forbid colors used by current actives a with t(a) < t(b). This yields an algorithm for k-colorability in O(n·w·k^w) time and O(k^w) space. The parameter is representation-dependent; recognizing circle graphs and finding a representation is polytime.\n\nBipartite-sides decomposition:\n- Fix a chord x. Removing x splits chords into three parts: left side L, right side R, and N(x). If L and R are bipartite, then for any fixed 2-coloring of each component of N(x), each side reduces to choosing one of its two bipartition orientations; vertices that cannot use their prescribed a/b color (due to conflicts with N(x)) are assigned the third color c_x, provided these “violators” form an independent set. This gives a polynomial-time extension test per choice and overall runtime O(3·2^{cc(N(x))}·poly(n)) for a fixed x; trying all x multiplies by n. This is polytime whenever cc(N(x)) is bounded and both sides are bipartite.\n\nLimits and obstacles:\n- Necessary local conditions (e.g., N(v) bipartite for all v) are far from sufficient; known triangle-free circle graphs can have chromatic number 5 (Ageev). The ply parameter can be Θ(n) even for easy instances. Extending the side method beyond bipartite sides appears to require an independent odd cycle transversal with list constraints.\n\nNext steps:\n- Unify and finalize the DP proof (k-colorability, O(n·w·k^w)). Implement and benchmark typical w values.\n- Replace the double-neighborhood trapezoid claim by the hereditary-permutation fact in all notes.\n- Explore a 2-SAT encoding to eliminate the 2^{cc(N(x))} factor; alternatively, branch on a small independent odd-cycle transversal per side.\n- Investigate two-chord separators and whether a global decomposition can be derived by combining permutation substructures.\n- Hardness attempt within K4-free circle graphs (gadget search aided by SAT/ILP)."},"proofs_update":{"action":"append","content":"Definitions and representation.\n- A circle graph is the intersection graph of a set of chords on a circle. Cutting the circle at a point not coinciding with any endpoint yields a linear order of 2n endpoints. Each chord x corresponds to an open interval I(x) = (s(x), t(x)) with s(x) < t(x). Two vertices x ≠ y are adjacent iff the intervals overlap without containment: either s(x) < s(y) < t(x) < t(y) or s(y) < s(x) < t(y) < t(x).\n- The ply w of the representation is the maximum size of the active set A(t) = {x : s(x) ≤ t < t(x)} over all cut points t (between consecutive endpoints).\n\nLemma 1 (Neighborhoods are permutation graphs).\nStatement. For any chord x, the induced subgraph G[N(x)] is a permutation graph.\nProof. Let the endpoints of x split the circle into open arcs A_L and A_R (in circular order). Every neighbor z ∈ N(x) has exactly one endpoint on A_L and one on A_R. Place the points of A_L and A_R on two parallel lines, in their circular orders. Map z to the straight segment connecting its endpoint on the A_L-line to its endpoint on the A_R-line. For z,z′ ∈ N(x), the chords cross iff the order of their endpoints is inverted between A_L and A_R, i.e., the two segments cross. This is precisely the permutation-graph model. ∎\n\nCorollary 2 (Double neighborhoods remain permutation). For any chords x,y, the induced subgraph on N(x) ∩ N(y) is a permutation graph.\nProof. By Lemma 1, G[N(x)] is permutation. The class of permutation graphs is hereditary, so every induced subgraph, in particular G[N(x) ∩ N(y)], is permutation. ∎\n\nTheorem 3 (FPT algorithm for k-colorability parameterized by ply w).\nStatement. Given a chord/interval representation of a circle graph G on n vertices with interval ply w, one can decide k-colorability in time O(n·w·k^w) and space O(k^w).\nAlgorithm (endpoint sweep DP). Sort the 2n endpoints to obtain an event order e_1, …, e_{2n}. Maintain at each step t the active set A_t = {x : s(x) ≤ e_t < t(x)} and a set S_t of states. A state is a proper coloring c: A_t → {1,…,k} consistent with all edges whose later-starting endpoint has appeared.\nTransitions.\n- Start of an interval b at e_{t+1} = s(b): Let N_t(b) = {a ∈ A_t : t(a) < t(b)}. For each state c ∈ S_t, define F_c = {c(a) : a ∈ N_t(b)}. For every color q ∈ {1,…,k} \\ F_c, create a successor state c′ extending c by c′(b) = q.\n- End of an interval a at e_{t+1} = t(a): For each state c ∈ S_t, remove a from its domain to obtain the successor state.\nCorrectness. Consider any edge {a,b} with s(a) < s(b). In the overlap model, {a,b} is an edge iff s(a) < s(b) < t(a) < t(b), i.e., at time s(b), a is active and t(a) < t(b). Thus {a,b} is enforced exactly when b starts: the color chosen for b must differ from c(a). All other pairs that are disjoint or nested impose no constraint. By induction over events, S_t consists precisely of the colorings of the partially revealed overlap graph consistent with processed constraints. Hence S_{2n} is nonempty iff G is k-colorable.\nComplexity. At any time, |A_t| ≤ w, so a state assigns ≤ w vertices, giving at most k^w states per layer. Each transition computes N_t(b) against A_t in O(w) time (or O(1) if we maintain suitable per-state summaries), so total time O(n·w·k^w). Memory per layer is O(k^w). ∎\n\nLemma 4 (Side adjacency determined by side endpoints). Fix a chord x with endpoints splitting the circle into A_L and A_R. Let N(x) be precolored with two colors a,b, and let c_x be the third color. For a chord y with both endpoints on A_L, y is adjacent to z ∈ N(x) iff the A_L-endpoint of z lies strictly between the two endpoints of y along A_L. The symmetric statement holds for A_R.\nProof. For z ∈ N(x), its endpoints lie one on each side arc. For y with both endpoints on A_L, the chords y and z cross exactly when the endpoints alternate along the circle, which here is equivalent to the A_L-endpoint of z lying between y’s endpoints on A_L. ∎\n\nProposition 5 (Side extension under bipartite sides). Let x be a fixed chord with color c_x. Suppose both side subgraphs L (chords with both endpoints on A_L) and R (both endpoints on A_R) are bipartite. Let N(x) be precolored properly with colors {a,b} = {1,2,3} \\ {c_x}. For a side H ∈ {L,R}, define for each y ∈ H a set S(y) ⊆ {a,b} of forbidden colors: q ∈ S(y) iff y is adjacent to some z ∈ N(x) of color q. Then H admits a proper coloring φ with colors in {c_x} ∪ ({a,b} \\ S(y)) for each y iff for every connected component C of H, at least one of the two bipartition-orientations o of C yields an independent set of violators B_o(C) := { y ∈ C : the a/b color prescribed by o is in S(y) }.\nMoreover, when such an orientation exists, coloring B_o(C) with c_x and the remaining vertices according to orientation o gives a proper coloring of C.\nProof. Let C be a connected component of H with bipartition (P,Q). There are exactly two 2-colorings of C with colors {a,b}: o assigns a to P, b to Q; o′ assigns b to P, a to Q. Fix an orientation o. Any y with its prescribed a/b color forbidden (i.e., y ∈ B_o(C)) must take color c_x. If B_o(C) is independent, the coloring that assigns c_x to B_o(C) and the o-prescribed a/b color to the rest is proper: edges inside C either join two vertices with different a/b colors (both outside B_o(C)) or one endpoint in B_o(C) (colors differ), and no edge has both endpoints in B_o(C) by independence. Edges from H to N(x) are respected by construction of S(·). Conversely, suppose there exists a proper coloring ψ of C respecting the lists {c_x} ∪ ({a,b} \\ S(y)). Consider the subgraph induced by vertices not colored c_x; ψ restricts to a proper 2-coloring with colors {a,b} and thus equals one of the two orientations (say o). Then the set of vertices colored c_x is exactly B_o(C), which must be independent; otherwise ψ would color adjacent vertices identically (both c_x). This proves the characterization. ∎\n\nCorollary 6 (Algorithm under bipartite sides). Fix x. If G[N(x)], L, and R are bipartite, then for each choice of c_x and for each choice of 2-coloring of the components of N(x), one can compute S(·) on both sides and test all side components via Proposition 5 in total polynomial time. If both sides succeed, combining these colorings with the fixed coloring of N(x) and c_x on x yields a proper 3-coloring of G. Trying all x gives an overall n-fold factor. This is polynomial-time whenever cc(N(x)) is bounded and both sides are bipartite. ∎"},"output_update":null}
