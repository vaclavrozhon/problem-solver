# Rigorous Proofs



Definitions and representation.
- A circle graph is the intersection graph of a set of chords on a circle. Cutting the circle at a point not coinciding with any endpoint yields a linear order of 2n endpoints. Each chord x corresponds to an open interval I(x) = (s(x), t(x)) with s(x) < t(x). Two vertices x ≠ y are adjacent iff the intervals overlap without containment: either s(x) < s(y) < t(x) < t(y) or s(y) < s(x) < t(y) < t(x).
- The ply w of the representation is the maximum size of the active set A(t) = {x : s(x) ≤ t < t(x)} over all cut points t (between consecutive endpoints).

Lemma 1 (Neighborhoods are permutation graphs).
Statement. For any chord x, the induced subgraph G[N(x)] is a permutation graph.
Proof. Let the endpoints of x split the circle into open arcs A_L and A_R (in circular order). Every neighbor z ∈ N(x) has exactly one endpoint on A_L and one on A_R. Place the points of A_L and A_R on two parallel lines, in their circular orders. Map z to the straight segment connecting its endpoint on the A_L-line to its endpoint on the A_R-line. For z,z′ ∈ N(x), the chords cross iff the order of their endpoints is inverted between A_L and A_R, i.e., the two segments cross. This is precisely the permutation-graph model. ∎

Corollary 2 (Double neighborhoods remain permutation). For any chords x,y, the induced subgraph on N(x) ∩ N(y) is a permutation graph.
Proof. By Lemma 1, G[N(x)] is permutation. The class of permutation graphs is hereditary, so every induced subgraph, in particular G[N(x) ∩ N(y)], is permutation. ∎

Theorem 3 (FPT algorithm for k-colorability parameterized by ply w).
Statement. Given a chord/interval representation of a circle graph G on n vertices with interval ply w, one can decide k-colorability in time O(n·w·k^w) and space O(k^w).
Algorithm (endpoint sweep DP). Sort the 2n endpoints to obtain an event order e_1, …, e_{2n}. Maintain at each step t the active set A_t = {x : s(x) ≤ e_t < t(x)} and a set S_t of states. A state is a proper coloring c: A_t → {1,…,k} consistent with all edges whose later-starting endpoint has appeared.
Transitions.
- Start of an interval b at e_{t+1} = s(b): Let N_t(b) = {a ∈ A_t : t(a) < t(b)}. For each state c ∈ S_t, define F_c = {c(a) : a ∈ N_t(b)}. For every color q ∈ {1,…,k} \ F_c, create a successor state c′ extending c by c′(b) = q.
- End of an interval a at e_{t+1} = t(a): For each state c ∈ S_t, remove a from its domain to obtain the successor state.
Correctness. Consider any edge {a,b} with s(a) < s(b). In the overlap model, {a,b} is an edge iff s(a) < s(b) < t(a) < t(b), i.e., at time s(b), a is active and t(a) < t(b). Thus {a,b} is enforced exactly when b starts: the color chosen for b must differ from c(a). All other pairs that are disjoint or nested impose no constraint. By induction over events, S_t consists precisely of the colorings of the partially revealed overlap graph consistent with processed constraints. Hence S_{2n} is nonempty iff G is k-colorable.
Complexity. At any time, |A_t| ≤ w, so a state assigns ≤ w vertices, giving at most k^w states per layer. Each transition computes N_t(b) against A_t in O(w) time (or O(1) if we maintain suitable per-state summaries), so total time O(n·w·k^w). Memory per layer is O(k^w). ∎

Lemma 4 (Side adjacency determined by side endpoints). Fix a chord x with endpoints splitting the circle into A_L and A_R. Let N(x) be precolored with two colors a,b, and let c_x be the third color. For a chord y with both endpoints on A_L, y is adjacent to z ∈ N(x) iff the A_L-endpoint of z lies strictly between the two endpoints of y along A_L. The symmetric statement holds for A_R.
Proof. For z ∈ N(x), its endpoints lie one on each side arc. For y with both endpoints on A_L, the chords y and z cross exactly when the endpoints alternate along the circle, which here is equivalent to the A_L-endpoint of z lying between y’s endpoints on A_L. ∎

Proposition 5 (Side extension under bipartite sides). Let x be a fixed chord with color c_x. Suppose both side subgraphs L (chords with both endpoints on A_L) and R (both endpoints on A_R) are bipartite. Let N(x) be precolored properly with colors {a,b} = {1,2,3} \ {c_x}. For a side H ∈ {L,R}, define for each y ∈ H a set S(y) ⊆ {a,b} of forbidden colors: q ∈ S(y) iff y is adjacent to some z ∈ N(x) of color q. Then H admits a proper coloring φ with colors in {c_x} ∪ ({a,b} \ S(y)) for each y iff for every connected component C of H, at least one of the two bipartition-orientations o of C yields an independent set of violators B_o(C) := { y ∈ C : the a/b color prescribed by o is in S(y) }.
Moreover, when such an orientation exists, coloring B_o(C) with c_x and the remaining vertices according to orientation o gives a proper coloring of C.
Proof. Let C be a connected component of H with bipartition (P,Q). There are exactly two 2-colorings of C with colors {a,b}: o assigns a to P, b to Q; o′ assigns b to P, a to Q. Fix an orientation o. Any y with its prescribed a/b color forbidden (i.e., y ∈ B_o(C)) must take color c_x. If B_o(C) is independent, the coloring that assigns c_x to B_o(C) and the o-prescribed a/b color to the rest is proper: edges inside C either join two vertices with different a/b colors (both outside B_o(C)) or one endpoint in B_o(C) (colors differ), and no edge has both endpoints in B_o(C) by independence. Edges from H to N(x) are respected by construction of S(·). Conversely, suppose there exists a proper coloring ψ of C respecting the lists {c_x} ∪ ({a,b} \ S(y)). Consider the subgraph induced by vertices not colored c_x; ψ restricts to a proper 2-coloring with colors {a,b} and thus equals one of the two orientations (say o). Then the set of vertices colored c_x is exactly B_o(C), which must be independent; otherwise ψ would color adjacent vertices identically (both c_x). This proves the characterization. ∎

Corollary 6 (Algorithm under bipartite sides). Fix x. If G[N(x)], L, and R are bipartite, then for each choice of c_x and for each choice of 2-coloring of the components of N(x), one can compute S(·) on both sides and test all side components via Proposition 5 in total polynomial time. If both sides succeed, combining these colorings with the fixed coloring of N(x) and c_x on x yields a proper 3-coloring of G. Trying all x gives an overall n-fold factor. This is polynomial-time whenever cc(N(x)) is bounded and both sides are bipartite. ∎
