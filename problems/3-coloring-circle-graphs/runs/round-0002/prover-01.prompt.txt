Complexity of 3-coloring circle graphs

Definitions.
• A graph is called a circle graph if it can be represented as an
intersection graph of chords in a circle. (That is, each vertex gets
assigned a chord in a circle, and two vertices are adjacent iff their
chords intersect.)
Question: What is the complexity of 3-coloring circle graphs?
Related results:
• For k-coloring of circle graphs with k ≥ 4, we know the problem
is NP-complete.
• For most superclasses of circle graphs, 3-coloring is known to be
NP-complete, usually because the superclasses also contain the class
planar graphs.
• Unger gave an algorithm for 3-coloring circle graphs in time
O(n log n) using a backtracking algorithm for a 3-SAT instance
with a specific structure based on the circle graph, however Bachmann, Rutter, and Stumpf have shown counterexamples to both
the reduction to 3-SAT and the backtracking algorithm.

Problem. Decide the complexity of 3-coloring circle graphs (intersection graphs of chords of a circle). Unger’s O(n log n) algorithm was refuted (Bachmann–Rutter–Stumpf). For k ≥ 4, k-coloring circle graphs is NP-complete.

Key observations consolidated this round:
- Representation: Cutting the circle away from endpoints turns chords into open intervals (s(x), t(x)) with x,y adjacent iff their intervals overlap without containment: s(x) < s(y) < t(x) < t(y) or vice versa.
- Neighborhood structure: For any chord x, N(x) induces a permutation graph: neighbors of x have one endpoint on each side arc; adjacency among them is determined by inversion between the two side orders. Consequently, in any 3-coloring N(x) must be bipartite.
- Two-chord view: For any x,y, the set N(x)∩N(y) is an induced subgraph of N(x) and hence also a permutation graph (permutation graphs are hereditary). This tightens and replaces a tentative “trapezoid” claim.

Parameterized algorithm (ply w):
- Define the interval ply w as the maximum number of intervals covering a point in the linearized representation. A sweep-line DP over the 2n endpoints maintains proper colorings of the active set; on the start of b, forbid colors used by current actives a with t(a) < t(b). This yields an algorithm for k-colorability in O(n·w·k^w) time and O(k^w) space. The parameter is representation-dependent; recognizing circle graphs and finding a representation is polytime.

Bipartite-sides decomposition:
- Fix a chord x. Removing x splits chords into three parts: left side L, right side R, and N(x). If L and R are bipartite, then for any fixed 2-coloring of each component of N(x), each side reduces to choosing one of its two bipartition orientations; vertices that cannot use their prescribed a/b color (due to conflicts with N(x)) are assigned the third color c_x, provided these “violators” form an independent set. This gives a polynomial-time extension test per choice and overall runtime O(3·2^{cc(N(x))}·poly(n)) for a fixed x; trying all x multiplies by n. This is polytime whenever cc(N(x)) is bounded and both sides are bipartite.

Limits and obstacles:
- Necessary local conditions (e.g., N(v) bipartite for all v) are far from sufficient; known triangle-free circle graphs can have chromatic number 5 (Ageev). The ply parameter can be Θ(n) even for easy instances. Extending the side method beyond bipartite sides appears to require an independent odd cycle transversal with list constraints.

Next steps:
- Unify and finalize the DP proof (k-colorability, O(n·w·k^w)). Implement and benchmark typical w values.
- Replace the double-neighborhood trapezoid claim by the hereditary-permutation fact in all notes.
- Explore a 2-SAT encoding to eliminate the 2^{cc(N(x))} factor; alternatively, branch on a small independent odd-cycle transversal per side.
- Investigate two-chord separators and whether a global decomposition can be derived by combining permutation substructures.
- Hardness attempt within K4-free circle graphs (gadget search aided by SAT/ILP).

# Main Results




=== Round 1 Summary ===

This round consolidated structural and algorithmic progress on 3-coloring circle graphs. Representation: cutting the circle yields open intervals where chords cross iff intervals overlap without containment. Local structure: for any chord x, G[N(x)] is a permutation graph (hence must be bipartite in any 3-coloring); likewise N(x)∩N(y) is permutation (hereditary). Algorithmic results: a sweep-line DP parameterized by interval ply w decides k-colorability in O(n·w·k^w) time and O(k^w) space. A bipartite-sides extension test fixes x and a 2-coloring of components of N(x); if both side-subgraphs are bipartite, extendability can be tested in polynomial time, yielding an overall factor 2^{cc(N(x))} per choice. Limits: local conditions are far from sufficient (Ageev’s triangle-free χ=5 examples), ply can be Θ(n), and previous trapezoid claims were replaced by hereditary-permutation facts. Refs: Unger; Bachmann–Rutter–Stumpf; Ageev.


=== Previous Round Feedback ===

Overall, the three submissions are coherent and largely correct, and they collectively deliver two concrete, verifiable contributions: (i) the neighborhood structure N(x) is a permutation graph (with immediate algorithmic consequences), and (ii) an FPT algorithm for k-colorability of circle graphs parameterized by the interval ply w of a given chord/interval representation, with explicit DP and correctness arguments. In addition, Prover 3 proposes a sound side-extension test that yields polynomial-time solvability under a bipartite-sides assumption, with an FPT factor 2^{cc(N(x))} for the number of components of N(x).

Key audits and fixes:
- Lemma on N(x): Correct, standard, and the proofs are fine. Consequence: N(x) is bipartite in any 3-coloring, so this necessary condition can be tested efficiently, but is not sufficient.
- “Double neighborhoods are trapezoid graphs” (Prover 1): This is unnecessarily weak and the proof sketch is not rigorous. Since N(x) is a permutation graph and permutation graphs are hereditary, N(x)∩N(y) is again a permutation graph. Please revise to this tighter, simpler statement (and drop the trapezoid mapping unless you give a complete construction).
- DP by ply w (Provers 1–2): The state transitions and correctness invariants are sound. Complexity bounds are fine; Prover 1’s O(n·3^w) implicitly hides an O(w) per step factor unless you maintain color summaries; Prover 2’s O(n·w·3^w) is safe. Note that w is representation-dependent; recognize explicitly that the FPT guarantee is with respect to the ply of the given (or computed) representation, which may not be minimal for the graph.
- Structural remarks (Prover 2): The Helly-based characterization of cliques as antichains among intervals covering a point is correct. Claims about permutation graphs’ polynomial-time colorability are fine; avoid relying on perfection unless needed.
- Bipartite-sides algorithm (Prover 3): The interface lemma (adjacency determined by presence of precolored endpoints in the side interval) is correct, and Proposition 4 is sound. The algorithm is correct under the stated assumptions and yields polytime if cc(N(x)) is bounded and both sides are bipartite. Please make explicit that you must try all choices of x and 2-colorings of N(x)’s components, and that failure for one x does not preclude success for another.

Concrete next steps:
- Consolidate DP: unify into a single theorem (k-colorability FPT in ply w) with a clean, fully detailed proof and an implementation plan. Provide careful parameter statement: on input either a chord representation or a graph with a computed representation, running time f(w)·poly(n).
- Replace Lemma B by the hereditary-permutation observation and, if desired, add a clean proof that N(x)∩N(y) is permutation.
- For the bipartite-sides approach, formalize the 2-SAT encoding to remove the 2^{cc(N(x))} factor, if possible. Otherwise, generalize to “small independent odd cycle transversal per side” with branching (parameter t + cc(N(x))).
- Empirical: implement both algorithms; measure typical ply and frequency of chords with bipartite sides.
- Hardness direction: work on K4-free circle-graph gadgets (wires/equality/NAE constraints) respecting chord realizability.
