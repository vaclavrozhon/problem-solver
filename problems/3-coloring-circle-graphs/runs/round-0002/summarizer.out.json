  "summary_md": "This round consolidated structural and algorithmic progress on 3-coloring circle graphs. Representation: cutting the circle yields open intervals and adjacency = overlap without containment. Structure: for any chord x, G[N(x)] is a permutation graph, and N(x)\u2229N(y) is permutation as well (hereditary), so N(x) must be bipartite in any 3-coloring. Algorithms: a sweep-line DP (path-decomposition view) gives k-colorability in O(n\u00b7w\u00b7k^w) time and O(k^w) space where w is the interval ply (pathwidth \u2264 w\u22121); w\u22642 implies the graph is a forest. Pivot method: fix chord x and a 2-coloring of components of N(x); if both side-subgraphs are bipartite, extendability can be tested in polynomial time, yielding an overall FPT factor 2^{cc(N(x))}. Limits: local necessary conditions are far from sufficient (Ageev\u2019s triangle-free \u03c7=5 examples), ply can be \u0398(n), and compressing the 2^{cc(N(x))} branching to a single 2-SAT generally fails except in special subclasses. Refs: Unger; Bachmann\u2013Rutter\u2013Stumpf; Ageev.",
