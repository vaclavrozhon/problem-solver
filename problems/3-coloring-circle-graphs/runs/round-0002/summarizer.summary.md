This round consolidated structural and algorithmic progress on 3-coloring circle graphs. Representation: cutting the circle yields open intervals and adjacency = overlap without containment. Structure: for any chord x, G[N(x)] is a permutation graph, and N(x)∩N(y) is permutation as well (hereditary), so N(x) must be bipartite in any 3-coloring. Algorithms: a sweep-line DP (path-decomposition view) gives k-colorability in O(n·w·k^w) time and O(k^w) space where w is the interval ply (pathwidth ≤ w−1); w≤2 implies the graph is a forest. Pivot method: fix chord x and a 2-coloring of components of N(x); if both side-subgraphs are bipartite, extendability can be tested in polynomial time, yielding an overall FPT factor 2^{cc(N(x))}. Limits: local necessary conditions are far from sufficient (Ageev’s triangle-free χ=5 examples), ply can be Θ(n), and compressing the 2^{cc(N(x))} branching to a single 2-SAT generally fails except in special subclasses.
