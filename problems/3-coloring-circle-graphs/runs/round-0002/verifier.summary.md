Validated: (i) N(x) and N(x)∩N(y) are permutation graphs; (ii) an FPT DP for k-colorability parameterized by representation ply w with O(n·w·k^w) time; (iii) a path-decomposition of width ≤ w−1 explaining the DP; (iv) ply ≤ 2 implies the overlap graph is a forest. The bipartite-sides pivot method is correct (with a 2-SAT packaging) and FPT in cc(N(x)). Open: removing the 2^{cc(N(x))} factor and extending beyond bipartite sides. Verdict: uncertain.
