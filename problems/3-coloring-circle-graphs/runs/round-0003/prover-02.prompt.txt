Complexity of 3-coloring circle graphs

Definitions.
• A graph is called a circle graph if it can be represented as an
intersection graph of chords in a circle. (That is, each vertex gets
assigned a chord in a circle, and two vertices are adjacent iff their
chords intersect.)
Question: What is the complexity of 3-coloring circle graphs?
Related results:
• For k-coloring of circle graphs with k ≥ 4, we know the problem
is NP-complete.
• For most superclasses of circle graphs, 3-coloring is known to be
NP-complete, usually because the superclasses also contain the class
planar graphs.
• Unger gave an algorithm for 3-coloring circle graphs in time
O(n log n) using a backtracking algorithm for a 3-SAT instance
with a specific structure based on the circle graph, however Bachmann, Rutter, and Stumpf have shown counterexamples to both
the reduction to 3-SAT and the backtracking algorithm.

Problem. Decide the complexity of 3-coloring circle graphs (intersection graphs of chords of a circle). Unger’s O(n log n) algorithm was refuted (Bachmann–Rutter–Stumpf). For k ≥ 4, k-coloring circle graphs is NP-complete.

Key observations consolidated this round:
- Representation: Cutting the circle away from endpoints turns chords into open intervals (s(x), t(x)) with x,y adjacent iff their intervals overlap without containment: s(x) < s(y) < t(x) < t(y) or vice versa.
- Neighborhood structure: For any chord x, N(x) induces a permutation graph: neighbors of x have one endpoint on each side arc; adjacency among them is determined by inversion between the two side orders. Consequently, in any 3-coloring N(x) must be bipartite.
- Two-chord view: For any x,y, the set N(x)∩N(y) is an induced subgraph of N(x) and hence also a permutation graph (permutation graphs are hereditary). This tightens and replaces a tentative “trapezoid” claim.

Parameterized algorithm (ply w):
- Define the interval ply w as the maximum number of intervals covering a point in the linearized representation. A sweep-line DP over the 2n endpoints maintains proper colorings of the active set; on the start of b, forbid colors used by current actives a with t(a) < t(b). This yields an algorithm for k-colorability in O(n·w·k^w) time and O(k^w) space. The parameter is representation-dependent; recognizing circle graphs and finding a representation is polytime.

Bipartite-sides decomposition:
- Fix a chord x. Removing x splits chords into three parts: left side L, right side R, and N(x). If L and R are bipartite, then for any fixed 2-coloring of each component of N(x), each side reduces to choosing one of its two bipartition orientations; vertices that cannot use their prescribed a/b color (due to conflicts with N(x)) are assigned the third color c_x, provided these “violators” form an independent set. This gives a polynomial-time extension test per choice and overall runtime O(3·2^{cc(N(x))}·poly(n)) for a fixed x; trying all x multiplies by n. This is polytime whenever cc(N(x)) is bounded and both sides are bipartite.

Limits and obstacles:
- Necessary local conditions (e.g., N(v) bipartite for all v) are far from sufficient; known triangle-free circle graphs can have chromatic number 5 (Ageev). The ply parameter can be Θ(n) even for easy instances. Extending the side method beyond bipartite sides appears to require an independent odd cycle transversal with list constraints.

Next steps:
- Unify and finalize the DP proof (k-colorability, O(n·w·k^w)). Implement and benchmark typical w values.
- Replace the double-neighborhood trapezoid claim by the hereditary-permutation fact in all notes.
- Explore a 2-SAT encoding to eliminate the 2^{cc(N(x))} factor; alternatively, branch on a small independent odd-cycle transversal per side.
- Investigate two-chord separators and whether a global decomposition can be derived by combining permutation substructures.
- Hardness attempt within K4-free circle graphs (gadget search aided by SAT/ILP).

Additional consolidated points this round

- Path-decomposition viewpoint. Let the 2n endpoints be sorted and consider the elementary segments between consecutive endpoints. For each segment σ, the bag B(σ) of intervals covering σ has size ≤ w (the ply). The sequence (B(σ)) is a path decomposition of the overlap graph: each vertex x appears in bags for σ ⊂ (s(x), t(x)) (contiguous), and each edge xy (with s(x)<s(y)<t(x)<t(y) or vice versa) is covered by any σ ⊂ (s(y), t(x)). Thus pathwidth ≤ w−1. The sweep DP is exactly standard DP on this path decomposition.

- Structural: tiny ply. If w ≤ 2, the overlap graph is acyclic (a forest): in any cycle, pick the interval with the smallest right endpoint; its two neighbors start before and end after it, so some point is covered by three intervals—a contradiction.

- Bipartite-sides pivot algorithm. For a chord x, if both sides L and R are bipartite and G[N(x)] is 2-colored, then each side component C admits a valid extension iff at least one orientation (assigning a/b to its bipartition) yields an independent set of violators; equivalently, one can encode the side as a 2-SAT instance with variables for component orientations and z-variables marking vertices assigned the third color. This gives polytime per fixed coloring of N(x) and yields an overall FPT algorithm in 2^{cc(N(x))} when such a pivot exists.

- Limits. The attempt to fold all N(x)-component orientation choices into a single 2-SAT generally fails because “color appears” at a side vertex becomes an OR over multiple components. A special “single-touch” subclass (each side vertex sees at most one N(x)-component) admits cleaner 2-SAT constraints, but avoiding branching over side-component orientations still needs a careful, fully polynomial argument.

- Next steps. Implement the ply-DP and the pivot algorithm (with 2-SAT packaging), measure typical w, cc(N(x)), and frequency of bipartite sides; explore two-pivot separators and orientations; pursue characterization for w ∈ {3,4}; and continue gadget search towards hardness within K4-free circle graphs.

# Main Results




=== Round 1 Summary ===

This round consolidated structural and algorithmic progress on 3-coloring circle graphs. Representation: cutting the circle yields open intervals where chords cross iff intervals overlap without containment. Local structure: for any chord x, G[N(x)] is a permutation graph (hence must be bipartite in any 3-coloring); likewise N(x)∩N(y) is permutation (hereditary). Algorithmic results: a sweep-line DP parameterized by interval ply w decides k-colorability in O(n·w·k^w) time and O(k^w) space. A bipartite-sides extension test fixes x and a 2-coloring of components of N(x); if both side-subgraphs are bipartite, extendability can be tested in polynomial time, yielding an overall factor 2^{cc(N(x))} per choice. Limits: local conditions are far from sufficient (Ageev’s triangle-free χ=5 examples), ply can be Θ(n), and previous trapezoid claims were replaced by hereditary-permutation facts. Refs: Unger; Bachmann–Rutter–Stumpf; Ageev.


=== Round 2 Summary ===

This round consolidated structural and algorithmic progress on 3-coloring circle graphs. Representation: cutting the circle yields open intervals and adjacency = overlap without containment. Structure: for any chord x, G[N(x)] is a permutation graph, and N(x)∩N(y) is permutation as well (hereditary), so N(x) must be bipartite in any 3-coloring. Algorithms: a sweep-line DP (path-decomposition view) gives k-colorability in O(n·w·k^w) time and O(k^w) space where w is the interval ply (pathwidth ≤ w−1); w≤2 implies the graph is a forest. Pivot method: fix chord x and a 2-coloring of components of N(x); if both side-subgraphs are bipartite, extendability can be tested in polynomial time, yielding an overall FPT factor 2^{cc(N(x))}. Limits: local necessary conditions are far from sufficient (Ageev’s triangle-free χ=5 examples), ply can be Θ(n), and compressing the 2^{cc(N(x))} branching to a single 2-SAT generally fails except in special subclasses. Refs: Unger; Bachmann–Rutter–Stumpf; Ageev.


=== Previous Round Feedback ===

Good progress this round: the three submissions are broadly consistent and technically sound on the core items. I highlight what is correct, what needs tightening, and concrete next steps.

What looks solid
- Overlap model and endpoint sweep: All three reuse the standard equivalence (chords ↔ open intervals; edges = overlap without containment). The sweep-based DP maintaining colorings of the active set is correct, with a safe bound O(n·w·k^w) time and O(k^w) space; Prover 2’s “k stacks” invariant is precise.
- Neighborhood structure: N(x) is a permutation graph is correct and well-argued; by heredity N(x)∩N(y) is permutation. This supersedes the earlier “trapezoid” remark.
- Path-decomposition view (Prover 1): The bags B(σ) (intervals covering an elementary segment σ) form a valid path decomposition of width ≤ w−1. This cleanly explains the DP and connects it to standard pathwidth DP. Keep the conservative runtime O(n·w·k^w) unless you spell out O(1) adjacency checks per introduce.
- Ply ≤ 2 implies acyclic (Prover 1): The proof is correct; any cycle forces three intervals to cover a point, contradicting w ≤ 2.
- Bipartite-sides pivot algorithm: The interface lemma and the per-component orientation/independence test are correct; the 2-SAT packaging per side (Prover 2) is valid and equivalent to the independence test. Overall this yields polytime under bipartite sides, with an FPT factor 2^{cc(N(x))} over the components of N(x).

Caveats and fixes
- Prover 1: Advertise O(n·w·k^w), not O(n·k^w), unless you give a concrete adjacency bookkeeping that removes the extra w factor.
- Prover 3: The “single-touch” subclass analysis is insightful, but the claim of a global polynomial 2-SAT without branching over side-component orientations is not fully justified; the presented route still branches. Keep it as a subclass/heuristic, not a theorem of general polytime solvability.

Next steps
- Proof polish: unify DP statements via the path-decomposition lemma; keep explicit data-structure choices and reconstruction.
- Implementation: (i) ply-DP; (ii) pivot algorithm with 2-SAT per side; measure typical w and cc(N(x)), and frequency of bipartite sides.
- Decomposition: pursue two-pivot separators (four sides + permutation middle), and try a combined orientation/independence test; attempt a 2-SAT or small-CSP encoding.
- Structure at tiny ply: fully characterize w=3 cases; can 3-coloring be polytime for w∈{3,4}?
- Hardness: develop K4-free circle-graph gadgets (wire/equality/NAE) respecting realizability.
