A. DP via path decomposition (polish) and two easy corollaries
- Path decomposition by ply. Sort the 2n endpoints and let the elementary segments σ be the open intervals between consecutive endpoints. Let B(σ) be the set of intervals covering σ; |B(σ)| ≤ w (the ply). Then (B(σ))_σ is a path decomposition of the overlap graph: each vertex x appears on all σ ⊂ (s(x),t(x)) (a contiguous subsequence), and each edge xy (with s(x)<s(y)<t(x)<t(y) or vice versa) is covered by any σ ⊂ (s(y),t(x)). Hence pathwidth ≤ w−1. The sweep DP from the previous round is precisely pathwidth-DP on this path decomposition.
- Corollary 1 (w ≤ 2 implies forest). If w ≤ 2, no point is covered by 3 intervals. Assume a cycle exists. Let a be a vertex of the cycle with minimum t(a). Its two neighbors on the cycle start before t(a) and end after s(a), hence both cover some point within (s(a),t(a)), forcing ply ≥ 3. Contradiction. Thus the graph is acyclic (and hence 3-colorable).
- Corollary 2 (degeneracy bound). In any overlap representation with ply w, the graph is (2w−2)-degenerate. Proof sketch: Order vertices by increasing right endpoint. When b starts, at most w−1 earlier-start intervals cover s(b), and among them, at most w−1 end after s(b) and before t(b), hence at most w−1 earlier neighbors. Symmetrically, at most w−1 later neighbors. Greedy deletion yields degeneracy ≤ 2w−2.

B. Computing side-interface constraints S(y) in near-linear time
Proposition B1. Fix a pivot chord x with arcs A_L,A_R and a 2-coloring of G[N(x)] with colors a,b. For each side vertex y ∈ L (resp. R), define S(y) ⊆ {a,b} to be the set of colors appearing among neighbors of y in N(x) (equivalently: the colors of u_z in the A_L-interval of y). Then all S(y) can be computed in O(n + |N(x)|) time by prefix sums along A_L and A_R.
Proof. Enumerate u_z on A_L in circular order, assign bit 1 to color a and bit 2 to color b, build prefix sums P_a, P_b. For y with endpoints (ℓ(y),r(y)) on A_L, S(y) contains a iff P_a(r(y))−P_a(ℓ(y))>0; similarly for b. Symmetric for A_R. Total O(n + |N(x)|).

C. A limitation example for the “bipartite-sides pivot” heuristic
Lemma C1. There exist 3-colorable circle graphs for which no pivot x has both side-subgraphs L_x and R_x bipartite.
Proof. Take two vertex-disjoint triangles T_L and T_R (each realizable by three pairwise crossing chords confined to disjoint arcs), and add an isolated chord x. The graph is 3-colorable (each triangle uses all three colors, x arbitrary). For any vertex v, one side contains one of the triangles, hence is not bipartite.

D. Extending the pivot method beyond bipartite sides: the oct ≤ 1 case
We generalize the side-extension test to allow one odd cycle per side component.

Definitions. For a pivot x, let L and R be the side-subgraphs; assume G[N(x)] is bipartite with a fixed 2-coloring {a,b}, and fix c_x as the third color. For a connected side component H, let oct(H) be the minimum size of an odd cycle transversal (OCT). We consider components with oct(H) ≤ 1 (i.e., either H is bipartite or removing a single vertex makes H bipartite).

Recall (from prior rounds). For bipartite H with bipartition (P,Q) and orientation o∈{0,1} mapping P→a,Q→b or vice versa, the “violators” B_o(H) are those y whose prescribed a/b color (under o) appears in S(y). For bipartite H, H is extendable iff for some orientation o, B_o(H) is independent (then color B_o(H) with c_x and the rest by o).

Theorem D1 (Side extension with oct ≤ 1). Let H be a side component with oct(H) ≤ 1. Given the fixed 2-coloring of N(x) and c_x, H admits an extension to a proper 3-coloring (using only colors {a,b,c_x} and respecting the precoloring on N(x)) iff there exists a vertex v∈V(H)∪{⊥} such that the bipartite graph H' := H−{v} satisfies: for some orientation o of H', the violator set B_o(H') is independent in H' and N_H(v) ∩ B_o(H') = ∅ (trivially true if v=⊥). In that case, coloring v by c_x (if v≠⊥), coloring B_o(H') by c_x, and coloring V(H')
B_o(H') by a/b according to o yields a proper extension on H.
Proof. (⇒) Suppose H extends to a proper 3-coloring φ with colors {a,b,c_x}. Let W := {y∈V(H): φ(y)=c_x}. If H is bipartite we take v=⊥; otherwise oct(H) ≤ 1 implies H−{v} is bipartite for some v∈W (because W hits every odd cycle, and since one vertex suffices, choose v accordingly). Consider H' = H−{v}. On H', φ uses only colors a,b on V(H')
W' where W' := W
{v}. Let o be the orientation corresponding to φ on H' (i.e., the bipartition of H' colored by a/b as in φ). Any y ∈ V(H') with φ(y) ∈ {a,b} cannot be adjacent in N(x) to a vertex colored with the same a/b color (else φ would be improper on the edge y–z with z∈N(x)). Hence such y is a non-violator under o. Conversely, any y with φ(y)=c_x belongs to W'; such y may or may not be a violator under o, but certainly B_o(H') ⊆ W'. Therefore B_o(H') is independent (W' is independent in φ), and N_H(v) ∩ B_o(H') = ∅ because both are subsets of W and φ is proper. (⇐) Conversely, pick v and o as in the statement. Assign c_x to v (if v≠⊥) and to B_o(H'); assign a/b to the remaining vertices according to o. Edges inside V(H')
B_o(H') are properly 2-colored; edges with exactly one endpoint in B_o(H') use distinct colors c_x vs a or b; edges within B_o(H') do not exist by independence; edges incident to v do not meet B_o(H') by the condition N_H(v) ∩ B_o(H') = ∅, and the other endpoint has color a or b; edges from H to N(x) are proper by definition of violators. Thus we obtain a valid extension on H.

Algorithmic consequence. For each connected H with oct(H) ≤ 1:
- If H is bipartite, we are in the earlier case. Otherwise, enumerate v over the vertices of any odd cycle (O(|H|) candidates). For each candidate v, form H' = H−{v}, compute its bipartition, test both orientations o, compute B_o(H') and check its independence, and ensure that v has no neighbor in B_o(H'). This is linear in |H| per v. Therefore, for a fixed precoloring of N(x), the side extension check runs in O(|H|^2) time in the worst case, and can be improved to near-linear with standard re-use across candidates by maintaining a bipartiteness check under single-vertex deletions.
- Combining both sides L and R (disjoint), and branching only over the 3 choices of c_x and the 2^{cc(N(x))} choices of 2-colorings of G[N(x)], we obtain overall time O(3·2^{cc(N(x))}·poly(n)) for a fixed x when each side component satisfies oct ≤ 1.
Correctness is exactly Theorem D1 for each side combined with the independence of L and R.

Remarks.
- This strictly generalizes the bipartite-sides case (taking v=⊥ everywhere).
- The oct ≤ 1 test is polynomial (e.g., try all v and test bipartiteness of H−{v}), though potentially O(|H|·(|H|+|E(H)|)). It is implementable and auditable.

E. Examples and checks
- Two-triangle example (Lemma C1) is realized by two disjoint triplets of chords on separated arcs plus one isolated chord. The algorithm above does not apply since no pivot has both sides bipartite; The oct ≤ 1 algorithm also fails unless we pick x at one triangle (then one side has oct=1, the other side has oct=1), but N(x)=2 (the other two vertices of its triangle) is bipartite; Our algorithm accepts (each side chooses v to break its odd cycle), demonstrating the gain over the strict bipartite-sides regime.
- Side-interface computation (Prop. B1) can be verified on random instances by comparing S(y) via prefix sums to direct adjacency enumeration.

F. Obstacles and negative results (audited)
- Global 2-SAT encoding that simultaneously chooses the 2-coloring of all components of N(x) and the side-component orientations generally fails: for a side edge uv, “both u,v violators” translates to (o_C conditioned) ∧ (OR over multiple N(x)-components’ flips), yielding clauses of width ≥3.
- The “single-touch” subclass (each side vertex touches at most one N(x)-component) still leaves orientation variables; gating constraints become 3-clauses, so a single 2-SAT instance without branching on side orientations remains unjustified in general.

G. Next steps (concrete)
1) Implement the oct ≤ 1 extension test per side component and integrate with the pivot scheme; measure how often real instances satisfy oct ≤ 1 on some pivot.
2) Optimize the oct ≤ 1 test with dynamic odd-cycle detection under single-vertex deletions (reuse BFS layers and parity certificates).
3) Explore further: oct ≤ t for small t (t=2,3) with bounded branching by choosing up to t extra c_x vertices per component subject to independence; this leads to an FPT routine parameterized by t plus cc(N(x)).
4) Continue exploration of two-pivot separators; identify a clean four-side extension lemma analogous to Theorem D1.
5) Hardness blueprint: design clause/variable gadgets living on sides with N(x) components as variable carriers; validate realizability within circle-graph chord diagrams via SAT-assisted search.

Summary
- Provided a polished pathwidth view and corollaries (forest at ply ≤ 2, degeneracy bound), and a near-linear procedure to compute S(y) from a fixed pivot.
- Exhibited a concrete limitation of the bipartite-sides pivot (no pivot with bipartite sides may exist even in 3-colorable circle graphs).
- Main new result: a correct, polynomial-time extension test for side components with odd-cycle transversal number ≤ 1 (Theorem D1), strictly generalizing the bipartite-sides case and yielding an auditable algorithm with factor 2^{cc(N(x))} for a fixed pivot.
