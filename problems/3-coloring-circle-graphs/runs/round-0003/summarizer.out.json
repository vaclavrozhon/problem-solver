  "summary_md": "This round consolidated structural and algorithmic facts about 3-coloring circle graphs. Representation: cutting the circle yields an interval-overlap model (adjacency = overlap without containment). Local structure: for any chord x, G[N(x)] is a permutation graph and N(x)\u2229N(y) is permutation (hereditary), so N(x) must be bipartite in any 3-coloring. Algorithms: a sweep-line DP / path-decomposition gives k-colorability in O(n\u00b7w\u00b7k^w) time and O(k^w) space where w is the interval ply (extends to list-coloring and counting); pathwidth \u2264 w\u22121 and degeneracy \u2264 2w\u22122; w\u22642 \u21d2 forest. Pivot method: fix chord x and a 2-coloring of components of N(x); if both side-subgraphs are bipartite, side-extension can be tested in polynomial time (2-SAT packaging), yielding overall FPT behavior with a 2^{cc(N(x))} branching factor per pivot. Limits: local necessary checks are far from sufficient (Ageev\u2019s triangle-free \u03c7=5), ply can be \u0398(n), and collapsing branching over N(x)-components into a single 2-SAT generally fails except in special \u201csingle-touch\u201d cases. Next tasks: formalize/implement DP, seek 2-SAT compression to remove 2^{cc(N(x))}, and search for hardness gadgets in K4-free circle graphs.
