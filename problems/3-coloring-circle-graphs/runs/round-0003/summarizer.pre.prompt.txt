Complexity of 3-coloring circle graphs

Definitions.
• A graph is called a circle graph if it can be represented as an
intersection graph of chords in a circle. (That is, each vertex gets
assigned a chord in a circle, and two vertices are adjacent iff their
chords intersect.)
Question: What is the complexity of 3-coloring circle graphs?
Related results:
• For k-coloring of circle graphs with k ≥ 4, we know the problem
is NP-complete.
• For most superclasses of circle graphs, 3-coloring is known to be
NP-complete, usually because the superclasses also contain the class
planar graphs.
• Unger gave an algorithm for 3-coloring circle graphs in time
O(n log n) using a backtracking algorithm for a 3-SAT instance
with a specific structure based on the circle graph, however Bachmann, Rutter, and Stumpf have shown counterexamples to both
the reduction to 3-SAT and the backtracking algorithm.

Problem. Decide the complexity of 3-coloring circle graphs (intersection graphs of chords of a circle). Unger’s O(n log n) algorithm was refuted (Bachmann–Rutter–Stumpf). For k ≥ 4, k-coloring circle graphs is NP-complete.

Key observations consolidated this round:
- Representation: Cutting the circle away from endpoints turns chords into open intervals (s(x), t(x)) with x,y adjacent iff their intervals overlap without containment: s(x) < s(y) < t(x) < t(y) or vice versa.
- Neighborhood structure: For any chord x, N(x) induces a permutation graph: neighbors of x have one endpoint on each side arc; adjacency among them is determined by inversion between the two side orders. Consequently, in any 3-coloring N(x) must be bipartite.
- Two-chord view: For any x,y, the set N(x)∩N(y) is an induced subgraph of N(x) and hence also a permutation graph (permutation graphs are hereditary). This tightens and replaces a tentative “trapezoid” claim.

Parameterized algorithm (ply w):
- Define the interval ply w as the maximum number of intervals covering a point in the linearized representation. A sweep-line DP over the 2n endpoints maintains proper colorings of the active set; on the start of b, forbid colors used by current actives a with t(a) < t(b). This yields an algorithm for k-colorability in O(n·w·k^w) time and O(k^w) space. The parameter is representation-dependent; recognizing circle graphs and finding a representation is polytime.

Bipartite-sides decomposition:
- Fix a chord x. Removing x splits chords into three parts: left side L, right side R, and N(x). If L and R are bipartite, then for any fixed 2-coloring of each component of N(x), each side reduces to choosing one of its two bipartition orientations; vertices that cannot use their prescribed a/b color (due to conflicts with N(x)) are assigned the third color c_x, provided these “violators” form an independent set. This gives a polynomial-time extension test per choice and overall runtime O(3·2^{cc(N(x))}·poly(n)) for a fixed x; trying all x multiplies by n. This is polytime whenever cc(N(x)) is bounded and both sides are bipartite.

Limits and obstacles:
- Necessary local conditions (e.g., N(v) bipartite for all v) are far from sufficient; known triangle-free circle graphs can have chromatic number 5 (Ageev). The ply parameter can be Θ(n) even for easy instances. Extending the side method beyond bipartite sides appears to require an independent odd cycle transversal with list constraints.

Next steps:
- Unify and finalize the DP proof (k-colorability, O(n·w·k^w)). Implement and benchmark typical w values.
- Replace the double-neighborhood trapezoid claim by the hereditary-permutation fact in all notes.
- Explore a 2-SAT encoding to eliminate the 2^{cc(N(x))} factor; alternatively, branch on a small independent odd-cycle transversal per side.
- Investigate two-chord separators and whether a global decomposition can be derived by combining permutation substructures.
- Hardness attempt within K4-free circle graphs (gadget search aided by SAT/ILP).

Additional consolidated points this round

- Path-decomposition viewpoint. Let the 2n endpoints be sorted and consider the elementary segments between consecutive endpoints. For each segment σ, the bag B(σ) of intervals covering σ has size ≤ w (the ply). The sequence (B(σ)) is a path decomposition of the overlap graph: each vertex x appears in bags for σ ⊂ (s(x), t(x)) (contiguous), and each edge xy (with s(x)<s(y)<t(x)<t(y) or vice versa) is covered by any σ ⊂ (s(y), t(x)). Thus pathwidth ≤ w−1. The sweep DP is exactly standard DP on this path decomposition.

- Structural: tiny ply. If w ≤ 2, the overlap graph is acyclic (a forest): in any cycle, pick the interval with the smallest right endpoint; its two neighbors start before and end after it, so some point is covered by three intervals—a contradiction.

- Bipartite-sides pivot algorithm. For a chord x, if both sides L and R are bipartite and G[N(x)] is 2-colored, then each side component C admits a valid extension iff at least one orientation (assigning a/b to its bipartition) yields an independent set of violators; equivalently, one can encode the side as a 2-SAT instance with variables for component orientations and z-variables marking vertices assigned the third color. This gives polytime per fixed coloring of N(x) and yields an overall FPT algorithm in 2^{cc(N(x))} when such a pivot exists.

- Limits. The attempt to fold all N(x)-component orientation choices into a single 2-SAT generally fails because “color appears” at a side vertex becomes an OR over multiple components. A special “single-touch” subclass (each side vertex sees at most one N(x)-component) admits cleaner 2-SAT constraints, but avoiding branching over side-component orientations still needs a careful, fully polynomial argument.

- Next steps. Implement the ply-DP and the pivot algorithm (with 2-SAT packaging), measure typical w, cc(N(x)), and frequency of bipartite sides; explore two-pivot separators and orientations; pursue characterization for w ∈ {3,4}; and continue gadget search towards hardness within K4-free circle graphs.

New audited observations and extensions

- Bags are permutation graphs. For any elementary segment σ between consecutive endpoints, the active set B(σ) has one endpoint on each side of σ; G[B(σ)] is a permutation graph under the left/right endpoint orders. This strengthens local structure beyond neighborhoods.

- Balanced separator (via sweep). There exists a segment σ with a(σ) := |{x : t(x) ≤ σ}| in [n/3, 2n/3]. Since every elementary segment has |B(σ)| ≥ 1 (between the first start and last end), c(σ) := |{x : s(x) ≥ σ}| = n − |B(σ)| − a(σ) ≤ n − 1 − n/3 < 2n/3, so removing B(σ) separates the graph into two parts of size ≤ 2n/3. This uses the path-decomposition separation property of the sweep bags.

- List-coloring and counting. The sweep/path-DP extends to list k-coloring and to counting colorings with runtime O(n·w·k^w) and space O(k^w), by maintaining per-bag proper list-respecting states and aggregating counts on identical projected states.

- Degeneracy bound. In any overlap representation with ply w, the graph is (2w−2)-degenerate: for a vertex b, at most w−1 earlier-start neighbors are active just right of s(b), and at most w−1 later-start neighbors are active just left of t(b); hence degree ≤ 2w−2 in any induced subgraph, yielding the degeneracy bound.

- Side-interface S(y) by prefix sums. For a pivot x and a fixed 2-coloring of N(x), all S(y) for y on a side arc can be computed in linear time via prefix sums over the arc’s endpoint order.

- Formal 2-SAT packaging (bipartite sides). With variables for side-component orientations and per-vertex z_y (color 3), independence and avoidance of forbidden colors reduce to 2-CNF; combined with branching over the 2-colorings of N(x)-components, this yields polytime per pivot and FPT in cc(N(x)).

- Caution on oct ≤ 1. The proposed iff criterion for extending across a side component with odd-cycle transversal ≤ 1 is not established; necessity fails if neighbors of the apex are forced to color 3. Treat this as a sufficient condition or as a branching-based FPT approach (parameter t + cc(N(x))).

Next actions: finalize proofs for the bag-permutation lemma, balanced separator (with the |B(σ)| ≥ 1 detail), list/counting DP, and degeneracy bound; implement DP and pivot+2-SAT; test empirical parameters w and cc(N(x)).

# Rigorous Proofs



Definitions and representation.
- A circle graph is the intersection graph of a set of chords on a circle. Cutting the circle at a point not coinciding with any endpoint yields a linear order of 2n endpoints. Each chord x corresponds to an open interval I(x) = (s(x), t(x)) with s(x) < t(x). Two vertices x ≠ y are adjacent iff the intervals overlap without containment: either s(x) < s(y) < t(x) < t(y) or s(y) < s(x) < t(y) < t(x).
- The ply w of the representation is the maximum size of the active set A(t) = {x : s(x) ≤ t < t(x)} over all cut points t (between consecutive endpoints).

Lemma 1 (Neighborhoods are permutation graphs).
Statement. For any chord x, the induced subgraph G[N(x)] is a permutation graph.
Proof. Let the endpoints of x split the circle into open arcs A_L and A_R (in circular order). Every neighbor z ∈ N(x) has exactly one endpoint on A_L and one on A_R. Place the points of A_L and A_R on two parallel lines, in their circular orders. Map z to the straight segment connecting its endpoint on the A_L-line to its endpoint on the A_R-line. For z,z′ ∈ N(x), the chords cross iff the order of their endpoints is inverted between A_L and A_R, i.e., the two segments cross. This is precisely the permutation-graph model. ∎

Corollary 2 (Double neighborhoods remain permutation). For any chords x,y, the induced subgraph on N(x) ∩ N(y) is a permutation graph.
Proof. By Lemma 1, G[N(x)] is permutation. The class of permutation graphs is hereditary, so every induced subgraph, in particular G[N(x) ∩ N(y)], is permutation. ∎

Theorem 3 (FPT algorithm for k-colorability parameterized by ply w).
Statement. Given a chord/interval representation of a circle graph G on n vertices with interval ply w, one can decide k-colorability in time O(n·w·k^w) and space O(k^w).
Algorithm (endpoint sweep DP). Sort the 2n endpoints to obtain an event order e_1, …, e_{2n}. Maintain at each step t the active set A_t = {x : s(x) ≤ e_t < t(x)} and a set S_t of states. A state is a proper coloring c: A_t → {1,…,k} consistent with all edges whose later-starting endpoint has appeared.
Transitions.
- Start of an interval b at e_{t+1} = s(b): Let N_t(b) = {a ∈ A_t : t(a) < t(b)}. For each state c ∈ S_t, define F_c = {c(a) : a ∈ N_t(b)}. For every color q ∈ {1,…,k} \ F_c, create a successor state c′ extending c by c′(b) = q.
- End of an interval a at e_{t+1} = t(a): For each state c ∈ S_t, remove a from its domain to obtain the successor state.
Correctness. Consider any edge {a,b} with s(a) < s(b). In the overlap model, {a,b} is an edge iff s(a) < s(b) < t(a) < t(b), i.e., at time s(b), a is active and t(a) < t(b). Thus {a,b} is enforced exactly when b starts: the color chosen for b must differ from c(a). All other pairs that are disjoint or nested impose no constraint. By induction over events, S_t consists precisely of the colorings of the partially revealed overlap graph consistent with processed constraints. Hence S_{2n} is nonempty iff G is k-colorable.
Complexity. At any time, |A_t| ≤ w, so a state assigns ≤ w vertices, giving at most k^w states per layer. Each transition computes N_t(b) against A_t in O(w) time (or O(1) if we maintain suitable per-state summaries), so total time O(n·w·k^w). Memory per layer is O(k^w). ∎

Lemma 4 (Side adjacency determined by side endpoints). Fix a chord x with endpoints splitting the circle into A_L and A_R. Let N(x) be precolored with two colors a,b, and let c_x be the third color. For a chord y with both endpoints on A_L, y is adjacent to z ∈ N(x) iff the A_L-endpoint of z lies strictly between the two endpoints of y along A_L. The symmetric statement holds for A_R.
Proof. For z ∈ N(x), its endpoints lie one on each side arc. For y with both endpoints on A_L, the chords y and z cross exactly when the endpoints alternate along the circle, which here is equivalent to the A_L-endpoint of z lying between y’s endpoints on A_L. ∎

Proposition 5 (Side extension under bipartite sides). Let x be a fixed chord with color c_x. Suppose both side subgraphs L (chords with both endpoints on A_L) and R (both endpoints on A_R) are bipartite. Let N(x) be precolored properly with colors {a,b} = {1,2,3} \ {c_x}. For a side H ∈ {L,R}, define for each y ∈ H a set S(y) ⊆ {a,b} of forbidden colors: q ∈ S(y) iff y is adjacent to some z ∈ N(x) of color q. Then H admits a proper coloring φ with colors in {c_x} ∪ ({a,b} \ S(y)) for each y iff for every connected component C of H, at least one of the two bipartition-orientations o of C yields an independent set of violators B_o(C) := { y ∈ C : the a/b color prescribed by o is in S(y) }.
Moreover, when such an orientation exists, coloring B_o(C) with c_x and the remaining vertices according to orientation o gives a proper coloring of C.
Proof. Let C be a connected component of H with bipartition (P,Q). There are exactly two 2-colorings of C with colors {a,b}: o assigns a to P, b to Q; o′ assigns b to P, a to Q. Fix an orientation o. Any y with its prescribed a/b color forbidden (i.e., y ∈ B_o(C)) must take color c_x. If B_o(C) is independent, the coloring that assigns c_x to B_o(C) and the o-prescribed a/b color to the rest is proper: edges inside C either join two vertices with different a/b colors (both outside B_o(C)) or one endpoint in B_o(C) (colors differ), and no edge has both endpoints in B_o(C) by independence. Edges from H to N(x) are respected by construction of S(·). Conversely, suppose there exists a proper coloring ψ of C respecting the lists {c_x} ∪ ({a,b} \ S(y)). Consider the subgraph induced by vertices not colored c_x; ψ restricts to a proper 2-coloring with colors {a,b} and thus equals one of the two orientations (say o). Then the set of vertices colored c_x is exactly B_o(C), which must be independent; otherwise ψ would color adjacent vertices identically (both c_x). This proves the characterization. ∎

Corollary 6 (Algorithm under bipartite sides). Fix x. If G[N(x)], L, and R are bipartite, then for each choice of c_x and for each choice of 2-coloring of the components of N(x), one can compute S(·) on both sides and test all side components via Proposition 5 in total polynomial time. If both sides succeed, combining these colorings with the fixed coloring of N(x) and c_x on x yields a proper 3-coloring of G. Trying all x gives an overall n-fold factor. This is polynomial-time whenever cc(N(x)) is bounded and both sides are bipartite. ∎

Lemma (Path decomposition of width ≤ w−1 from ply).
Let a circle graph be given by an interval-overlap representation with distinct endpoints, and let w be the maximum number of intervals covering any point. Consider the elementary segments σ between consecutive endpoints. For each σ, define B(σ) = {x : s(x) < σ < t(x)}. Then the sequence of bags (B(σ)) in left-to-right order is a path decomposition of the overlap graph of width at most w−1.
Proof. (i) Vertex contiguity: For any interval x, the set of segments σ with s(x) < σ < t(x) is an interval on the line; hence x appears in a contiguous block of bags. (ii) Edge coverage: If x,y are adjacent in the overlap graph, w.l.o.g. s(x) < s(y) < t(x) < t(y). Any σ with s(y) < σ < t(x) is contained in both (s(x), t(x)) and (s(y), t(y)), so both x and y are in B(σ). (iii) Width: By definition of ply, |B(σ)| ≤ w for all σ, thus the width is at most w−1. ∎

Proposition (Ply ≤ 2 implies acyclic).
If the ply w ≤ 2, then the overlap (circle) graph is a forest (in particular, bipartite and 3-colorable).
Proof. Suppose there is a cycle C = (v_1, v_2, …, v_m) with m ≥ 3. Choose v_1 with minimal right endpoint t(v_1) among vertices of C. In the overlap model, v_1 is adjacent to v_2 and v_m, so for each i ∈ {2,m} either s(v_1) < s(v_i) < t(v_1) < t(v_i) or s(v_i) < s(v_1) < t(v_i) < t(v_1). The latter alternative would give t(v_i) < t(v_1), contradicting the choice of v_1. Hence s(v_1) < s(v_2) < t(v_1) < t(v_2) and s(v_1) < s(v_m) < t(v_1) < t(v_m). Pick any point p with max{s(v_2), s(v_m)} < p < t(v_1). Then v_1, v_2, and v_m all cover p, so three intervals cover p, contradicting w ≤ 2. Therefore no cycle exists and the graph is acyclic. ∎

Lemma (Bags induce permutation graphs).
In an interval-overlap representation, fix an elementary segment σ between consecutive endpoints and let B(σ) = {x : s(x) < σ < t(x)}. Then G[B(σ)] is a permutation graph.
Proof. Each x ∈ B(σ) has one endpoint on the left of σ and one on the right. Place left endpoints (in increasing order) on a top line and right endpoints (in increasing order) on a bottom line; connect the two endpoints of each x by a straight segment. For x,y ∈ B(σ), we have x adjacent to y in the overlap graph iff s(x) < s(y) and t(x) > t(y) or vice versa, i.e., the orders on the two lines are inverted, which is exactly the permutation-graph model. ∎

Lemma (Balanced separator of size ≤ w via the sweep).
Let w be the ply. There exists a segment σ such that removing S = B(σ) disconnects the graph into two parts A and C with |A|, |C| ≤ 2n/3.
Proof. Order the elementary segments σ_1,…,σ_m. Let a(i) = |{x : t(x) ≤ σ_i}| and c(i) = |{x : s(x) ≥ σ_i}|. We have a(1)=0, a(m)=n, and a(i+1)−a(i) ∈ {0,1}. Thus there exists i with a(i) ∈ [⌊n/3⌋, ⌈2n/3⌉]. For σ=σ_i, every vertex not in S := B(σ) lies entirely to one side, so removing S separates the graph into A of size a(i) and C of size c(i). Moreover, for every elementary segment we have |B(σ)| ≥ 1 (between the first start and last end), hence c(i) = n − |B(σ)| − a(i) ≤ n − 1 − n/3 < 2n/3, and also a(i) ≤ 2n/3 by choice. Therefore |A|, |C| ≤ 2n/3. ∎

Corollary (List-coloring and counting by ply-DP).
Given lists L(v) ⊆ {1,…,k}, list k-colorability of a circle graph with representation ply w can be decided in O(n·w·k^w) time and O(k^w) space by the sweep/path DP: on introducing u at its start, extend a state only with colors in L(u) \ {c(a) : t(a) < t(u)}; on forgetting u at its end, project the state. Counting k-colorings follows by storing counts per state and summing over equivalent projections. ∎

Lemma (Degeneracy bound).
In an interval-overlap representation with ply w, the graph is (2w−2)-degenerate.
Proof. Consider any induced subgraph and any vertex b in it. Just to the right of s(b), there are at most w−1 other active intervals; all earlier-start neighbors of b must be active there, so b has at most w−1 earlier-start neighbors. Symmetrically, just to the left of t(b), there are at most w−1 other active intervals; all later-start neighbors of b must be active there, so b has at most w−1 later-start neighbors. Hence deg(b) ≤ 2w−2 in any induced subgraph, and the degeneracy is at most 2w−2. ∎
