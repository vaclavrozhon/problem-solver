{"summary_md":"This round consolidated structural and algorithmic facts about 3-coloring circle graphs. Representation: cutting the circle yields an interval-overlap model (adjacency = overlap without containment). Local structure: for any chord x, G[N(x)] is a permutation graph and N(x)∩N(y) is permutation (hereditary), so N(x) must be bipartite in any 3-coloring. Algorithms: a sweep-line DP / path-decomposition gives k-colorability in O(n·w·k^w) time and O(k^w) space where w is the interval ply (extends to list-coloring and counting); pathwidth ≤ w−1 and degeneracy ≤ 2w−2; w≤2 ⇒ forest. Pivot method: fix chord x and a 2-coloring of components of N(x); if both side-subgraphs are bipartite, side-extension can be tested in polynomial time (2-SAT packaging), yielding overall FPT behavior with a 2^{cc(N(x))} branching factor per pivot. Limits: local necessary checks are far from sufficient (Ageev’s triangle-free χ=5), ply can be Θ(n), and collapsing branching over N(x)-components into a single 2-SAT generally fails except in special “single-touch” cases. Next tasks: formalize/implement DP, seek 2-SAT compression to remove 2^{cc(N(x))}, and search for hardness gadgets in K4-free circle graphs.
