  "feedback_md": "Strong technical consolidation overall, with several auditable additions. Key points by prover with rigor checks and action items:\n\nProver 1\n- Lemma \u201cevery sweep bag is a permutation graph\u201d is correct: for a segment \u03c3, each active interval has one endpoint to the left and one to the right; adjacencies in G[B(\u03c3)] coincide with inversions of the two orders. Useful local structure; good to add to proofs.\n- Balanced separator lemma: the high-level argument is fine but the proof needs one fix. To conclude |A|,|C| \u2264 2n/3, explicitly use that every elementary segment has |B(\u03c3)| \u2265 1 (between the first start and last end), so for i with a(i) \u2265 n/3 we get c(i) = n \u2212 |B(\u03c3)| \u2212 a(i) \u2264 n \u2212 1 \u2212 n/3 < 2n/3. Please revise this step. The separator does separate by the path-decomposition property.\n- List-coloring and counting via DP: extensions are correct; transitions and complexity O(n\u00b7w\u00b7k^w) are justified. Good to include as a corollary/extension of the base DP.\n\nProver 2\n- The refined DP description (per-color stacks with O(1) push/pop) is sound. Runtime O(n\u00b7k^{w+1}) matches O(n\u00b7w\u00b7k^w); please present the unified bound O(n\u00b7w\u00b7k^w) and note the extra k factor per start event. Space O(k^w) is correct.\n- The interface lemma and 2-SAT packaging on each bipartite side are correct and equivalent to the \u201corientation + independent violators\u201d test. This is now fully formal; good to move into proofs with explicit clause mapping.\n- The argument why a single 2-SAT over all N(x)-component orientations is not possible in general (gated XOR/OR) is accurate.\n\nProver 3\n- Computing S(y) by prefix sums on a side arc is correct and implementable in linear time per pivot after sorting endpoints. Include as an algorithmic lemma.\n- Degeneracy bound (\u2264 2w\u22122) is plausible and can be made rigorous; provide full proof (split neighbors into earlier- and later-start; each side \u2264 w\u22121 via active-set arguments). Good to add.\n- Caution: Theorem D1 (side extension when oct \u2264 1) as an iff is not currently justified. The necessity proof incorrectly assumes one can pick v \u2208 W (the c_x-set) with H\u2212{v} bipartite; in general a valid extension may use multiple c_x vertices not including the unique apex v that hits all odd cycles. Moreover, forced-c_x neighbors of the apex (S(y)={a,b}) may require color 3 near v, defeating the \u201cN_H(v) \u2229 B = \u2205\u201d condition while a different extension exists. Please downgrade to a sufficient condition (or to an algorithm that branches on small independent OCT sets) and supply a corrected necessity direction if you keep an equivalence.\n\nConcrete next steps\n- Fix and finalize the balanced separator proof; add the bag-permutation lemma, list-coloring/counting corollary, degeneracy bound, and the side 2-SAT formalization to proofs.md.\n- For the oct \u2264 1 case, either (i) prove only the \u201cif\u201d direction as a sufficient criterion, or (ii) generalize to an FPT branching on an independent OCT of size t per side (parameter t + cc(N(x))). Provide a counterexample or conditions excluding forced-c_x neighbors if you still aim for \u201ciff\u201d.\n- Implementation: endpoint-DP (lists/counting) and pivot 2-SAT; measure typical w, cc(N(x)), and frequency of pivots with bipartite sides.\n",

    "content": "New audited observations and extensions\n\n- Bags are permutation graphs. For any elementary segment \u03c3 between consecutive endpoints, the active set B(\u03c3) has one endpoint on each side of \u03c3; G[B(\u03c3)] is a permutation graph under the left/right endpoint orders. This strengthens local structure beyond neighborhoods.\n\n- Balanced separator (via sweep). There exists a segment \u03c3 with a(\u03c3) := |{x : t(x) \u2264 \u03c3}| in [n/3, 2n/3]. Since every elementary segment has |B(\u03c3)| \u2265 1 (between the first start and last end), c(\u03c3) := |{x : s(x) \u2265 \u03c3}| = n \u2212 |B(\u03c3)| \u2212 a(\u03c3) \u2264 n \u2212 1 \u2212 n/3 < 2n/3, so removing B(\u03c3) separates the graph into two parts of size \u2264 2n/3. This uses the path-decomposition separation property of the sweep bags.\n\n- List-coloring and counting. The sweep/path-DP extends to list k-coloring and to counting colorings with runtime O(n\u00b7w\u00b7k^w) and space O(k^w), by maintaining per-bag proper list-respecting states and aggregating counts on identical projected states.\n\n- Degeneracy bound. In any overlap representation with ply w, the graph is (2w\u22122)-degenerate: for a vertex b, at most w\u22121 earlier-start neighbors are active just right of s(b), and at most w\u22121 later-start neighbors are active just left of t(b); hence degree \u2264 2w\u22122 in any induced subgraph, yielding the degeneracy bound.\n\n- Side-interface S(y) by prefix sums. For a pivot x and a fixed 2-coloring of N(x), all S(y) for y on a side arc can be computed in linear time via prefix sums over the arc\u2019s endpoint order.\n\n- Formal 2-SAT packaging (bipartite sides). With variables for side-component orientations and per-vertex z_y (color 3), independence and avoidance of forbidden colors reduce to 2-CNF; combined with branching over the 2-colorings of N(x)-components, this yields polytime per pivot and FPT in cc(N(x)).\n\n- Caution on oct \u2264 1. The proposed iff criterion for extending across a side component with odd-cycle transversal \u2264 1 is not established; necessity fails if neighbors of the apex are forced to color 3. Treat this as a sufficient condition or as a branching-based FPT approach (parameter t + cc(N(x))).\n\nNext actions: finalize proofs for the bag-permutation lemma, balanced separator (with the |B(\u03c3)| \u2265 1 detail), list/counting DP, and degeneracy bound; implement DP and pivot+2-SAT; test empirical parameters w and cc(N(x))."

    "content": "Lemma (Bags induce permutation graphs).\nIn an interval-overlap representation, fix an elementary segment \u03c3 between consecutive endpoints and let B(\u03c3) = {x : s(x) < \u03c3 < t(x)}. Then G[B(\u03c3)] is a permutation graph.\nProof. Each x \u2208 B(\u03c3) has one endpoint on the left of \u03c3 and one on the right. Place left endpoints (in increasing order) on a top line and right endpoints (in increasing order) on a bottom line; connect the two endpoints of each x by a straight segment. For x,y \u2208 B(\u03c3), we have x adjacent to y in the overlap graph iff s(x) < s(y) and t(x) > t(y) or vice versa, i.e., the orders on the two lines are inverted, which is exactly the permutation-graph model. \u220e\n\nLemma (Balanced separator of size \u2264 w via the sweep).\nLet w be the ply. There exists a segment \u03c3 such that removing S = B(\u03c3) disconnects the graph into two parts A and C with |A|, |C| \u2264 2n/3.\nProof. Order the elementary segments \u03c3_1,\u2026,\u03c3_m. Let a(i) = |{x : t(x) \u2264 \u03c3_i}| and c(i) = |{x : s(x) \u2265 \u03c3_i}|. We have a(1)=0, a(m)=n, and a(i+1)\u2212a(i) \u2208 {0,1}. Thus there exists i with a(i) \u2208 [\u230an/3\u230b, \u23082n/3\u2309]. For \u03c3=\u03c3_i, every vertex not in S := B(\u03c3) lies entirely to one side, so removing S separates the graph into A of size a(i) and C of size c(i). Moreover, for every elementary segment we have |B(\u03c3)| \u2265 1 (between the first start and last end), hence c(i) = n \u2212 |B(\u03c3)| \u2212 a(i) \u2264 n \u2212 1 \u2212 n/3 < 2n/3, and also a(i) \u2264 2n/3 by choice. Therefore |A|, |C| \u2264 2n/3. \u220e\n\nCorollary (List-coloring and counting by ply-DP).\nGiven lists L(v) \u2286 {1,\u2026,k}, list k-colorability of a circle graph with representation ply w can be decided in O(n\u00b7w\u00b7k^w) time and O(k^w) space by the sweep/path DP: on introducing u at its start, extend a state only with colors in L(u) \\ {c(a) : t(a) < t(u)}; on forgetting u at its end, project the state. Counting k-colorings follows by storing counts per state and summing over equivalent projections. \u220e\n\nLemma (Degeneracy bound).\nIn an interval-overlap representation with ply w, the graph is (2w\u22122)-degenerate.\nProof. Consider any induced subgraph and any vertex b in it. Just to the right of s(b), there are at most w\u22121 other active intervals; all earlier-start neighbors of b must be active there, so b has at most w\u22121 earlier-start neighbors. Symmetrically, just to the left of t(b), there are at most w\u22121 other active intervals; all later-start neighbors of b must be active there, so b has at most w\u22121 later-start neighbors. Hence deg(b) \u2264 2w\u22122 in any induced subgraph, and the degeneracy is at most 2w\u22122. \u220e"
