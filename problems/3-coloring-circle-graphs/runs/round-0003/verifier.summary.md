Verified additions: (1) sweep bags induce permutation graphs; (2) balanced separator via sweep (with a minor proof fix); (3) list-coloring and counting extensions of the ply-DP (O(n·w·k^w)); (4) formal 2-SAT side-extension under bipartite sides; (5) degeneracy ≤ 2w−2; (6) linear-time computation of side constraints S(y). Warning: the claimed equivalence for side extension when oct ≤ 1 is not justified; keep only a sufficient condition or convert to an FPT branching scheme. Overall verdict: uncertain.
