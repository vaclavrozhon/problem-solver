  "content": "Status\nI consolidate several structural and algorithmic facts that are directly checkable from a chord (interval-overlap) representation, including new rigorous proofs and explicit encodings useful for algorithms and hardness attempts.\n\nHelly-type property for cliques in overlap (circle) graphs\nLemma 5 (Cliques have a common intersection). Let S be a clique in the overlap graph of open intervals on a line (obtained by cutting the circle). Then \u22c2_{x\u2208S} (s(x), t(x)) \u2260 \u2205.\nProof. Order S so that s(x1)<\u2026<s(xk). Since S is a clique, for the pair x1,xk we must have s(x1)<s(xk)<t(x1)<t(xk). In particular, s(xk)<t(x1). For any i with 1<i<k, from x1\u223cxi we get s(x1)<s(xi)<t(x1)<t(xi); from xi\u223cxk we get s(xi)<s(xk)<t(xi)<t(xk). Hence s(xk)<t(xi) and s(xi)<t(x1). Choose p with s(xk)<p<t(x1). Then for all i we have s(xi)\u2264s(xk)<p and p<t(x1)\u2264t(xi), so p\u2208(s(xi), t(xi)). \u220e\n\nCorollary 5.1. For a circle graph G with circular ply w: (i) \u03c9(G) \u2264 w; (ii) For any elementary segment \u03c3 between consecutive endpoints, any clique S has S\u2286B(\u03c3) for any \u03c3 contained in \u22c2_{x\u2208S} (s(x), t(x)); hence \u03c9(G)=max_\u03c3 \u03c9(G[B(\u03c3)]).\n\nAlgorithmic corollary (computing \u03c9). Since G[B(\u03c3)] is a permutation graph (Lemma 3 from prior round), \u03c9(G[B(\u03c3)]) is the length of a longest decreasing subsequence between the two orders and is computable in O(|B(\u03c3)| log |B(\u03c3)|). Scanning all \u03c3 yields \u03c9(G) in time O(\u2211_\u03c3 |B(\u03c3)| log |B(\u03c3)|) = O(n\u00b7w\u00b7log w).\n\nDegeneracy bound from ply\nLemma 6 (Degeneracy \u2264 2w\u22122). In any induced subgraph H of G with representation inherited from G and ply \u2264 w, there is a vertex of degree \u2264 2w\u22122.\nProof. Take v with minimum start s(v) among vertices of H. Partition N_H(v) into E (earlier-start) and L (later-start) neighbors. If u\u2208E then s(u)<s(v)<t(u)<t(v) (overlap without containment). All such u are active immediately to the right of s(v), where at most w\u22121 vertices other than v are active; hence |E| \u2264 w\u22121. If u\u2208L then s(v)<s(u)<t(v)<t(u). All such u are active immediately to the left of t(v), where again at most w\u22121 vertices other than v are active; hence |L| \u2264 w\u22121. Therefore deg_H(v)=|E|+|L| \u2264 2w\u22122, as claimed. Since H was arbitrary, G is (2w\u22122)-degenerate. \u220e\n\nCorollary 6.1. If w\u22642 then \u0394(G)\u22642 and G is a forest (prior proposition). Combining yields that for w\u22642, G is a disjoint union of paths.\n\nBalanced separator via sweep (proof finalized)\nLemma 7 (Balanced separator of size \u2264 w). There exists a segment \u03c3 such that removing S=B(\u03c3) separates G into A (left) and C (right) with |A|,|C| \u2264 2n/3.\nProof. Enumerate elementary segments \u03c31,\u2026,\u03c3m. Let a(i)=|{x: t(x)\u2264\u03c3i}|, c(i)=|{x: s(x)\u2265\u03c3i}|, and b(i)=|B(\u03c3i)|. Note a(1)=0, a(m)=n, c(1)=n\u2212b(1) \u2264 n\u22121, c(m)=0; both a and c change by at most 1 between consecutive segments; for each i, a(i)+b(i)+c(i)=n. By discrete intermediate value, choose i with a(i)\u2208[n/3,2n/3]. Then c(i)=n\u2212b(i)\u2212a(i) \u2264 n\u22121\u2212n/3 < 2n/3 because b(i)\u22651 between the first start and the last end. Removing B(\u03c3i) separates already-ended vertices from not-yet-started ones by the path-decomposition property, yielding the bound. \u220e\n\nBags are permutation graphs (recall)\nLemma 3 (from prior round). For any \u03c3, G[B(\u03c3)] is a permutation graph defined by the left/right endpoint orders around \u03c3.\n\nList-coloring and counting DP (recall, with explicit transitions)\nTheorem 2 (from prior round, with explicit introduce/forget). On the path decomposition {B(\u03c3)}, maintain per bag all proper list-respecting colorings c: B\u2192{1,\u2026,k}; introduce u adds c(u)\u2208L(u) avoiding {c(a): t(a)<t(u)}; forget u projects. Complexity O(n\u00b7w\u00b7k^w) time, O(k^w) space. Aggregating counts per projected state yields # of colorings.\n\nPivot side-extension encoded as 2-SAT (fully explicit)\nSetup. Fix a pivot chord x and a color c_x\u2208{1,2,3} for x. Assume G[N(x)] is bipartite (necessary in any 3-coloring) and fix a proper 2-coloring of each component with colors {\u03b1,\u03b2}={1,2,3}\\{c_x}. Let L and R be the side subgraphs (vertices with both endpoints on the left/right arc), and suppose a side component C is bipartite with bipartition (U_C,V_C).\n\nVariables. For each side component C, a Boolean o_C (orientation): o_C=0 assigns color \u03b1 to U_C and \u03b2 to V_C; o_C=1 swaps. For each vertex y on the side, a Boolean z_y indicating y takes color c_x (z_y=1) vs a side color (z_y=0).\n\nForbidden-color sets f_y. Define f_y\u2286{\u03b1,\u03b2} as the set of side colors that appear on neighbors of y in N(x) under the fixed 2-coloring. Then any valid extension must avoid giving y a side color in f_y.\n\nClause construction.\n- If f_y contains \u03b1, add (y\u2208U_C ? (\u00aco_C \u2228 z_y) : (o_C \u2228 z_y)); if f_y contains \u03b2, add (y\u2208U_C ? (o_C \u2228 z_y) : (\u00aco_C \u2228 z_y)). If f_y={\u03b1,\u03b2}, also add unit clause (z_y).\n- For every edge yz within the side, add (\u00acz_y \u2228 \u00acz_z) to forbid adjacent c_x assignments.\nCall \u03a6 the conjunction of all such clauses across all side components; the two sides L and R are independent given N(x) and x, so build \u03a6_L and \u03a6_R separately.\n\nLemma 8 (Correctness of 2-SAT packaging). For a fixed pivot x, chosen c_x, and fixed 2-coloring of G[N(x)], \u03a6_side is satisfiable iff there exists a proper 3-coloring of the side consistent with these choices.\nProof. (\u21d2) From a satisfying assignment, define colors: if z_y=1, set col(y)=c_x; else set col(y)=\u03b1 or \u03b2 according to o_C and y\u2019s side of the bipartition. Clauses ensure: (i) y\u2019s side color is not in f_y (implication forces z_y=1 whenever the oriented side color would be forbidden), so all edges to N(x) are proper; (ii) (\u00acz_y\u2228\u00acz_z) forbids adjacent vertices both taking c_x; hence side edges are proper. (\u21d0) Given a proper extension, set z_y=1 iff col(y)=c_x; set o_C to match the side colors on U_C/V_C. Then every implication clause is satisfied (otherwise y would have a forbidden side color), and no edge has both z\u2019s true. \u220e\n\nComputing f_y on a side in linear time\nLemma 9. For a fixed 2-coloring of N(x), the sets f_y for all side vertices y on L (resp. R) can be computed in O(|L|+|N(x)|) time.\nProof. Along the left arc, sweep from one endpoint to the other, processing events: (i) the left/right endpoints of side chords y; (ii) the unique left endpoint of each neighbor n\u2208N(x) (neighbors have exactly one endpoint on the left arc). Maintain counters A,B = number of processed N(x)-endpoints colored \u03b1,\u03b2 respectively. At the left endpoint of y record (A_left,B_left); at the right endpoint record (A_right,B_right). Then y sees \u03b1 (resp. \u03b2) in N(x) between its endpoints iff A_right>A_left (resp. B_right>B_left). Thus f_y is determined. \u220e\n\nPutting the pivot algorithm together\nProposition 9.1. If there exists a pivot x such that both side-subgraphs L and R are bipartite, then for each choice of c_x and for each 2-coloring of each component of N(x) (there are 2^{cc(N(x))} such), the existence of an extension to a 3-coloring can be decided in polynomial time by solving \u03a6_L and \u03a6_R (each a 2-SAT instance). Overall runtime O(3\u00b72^{cc(N(x))}\u00b7poly(n)).\n\nRemarks and limitations\n- The branching factor 2^{cc(N(x)))} cannot, in general, be merged into a single global 2-SAT without additional assumptions (\u201csingle-touch\u201d case is a special tractable subclass). The above packaging is correct and implementable.\n- Combined with Theorem 2, we have: decision, list-coloring, and counting are FPT in ply w with O(n\u00b7w\u00b73^w) time; \u03c9(G)\u2264w and computable in O(n\u00b7w\u00b7log w); balanced separators of size \u2264 w exist; degeneracy \u2264 2w\u22122 (hence m \u2264 (w\u22121)n by charging edges to later-start endpoints), giving simple sparsity bounds.\n\nExamples/sanity\n- For w=2: \u0394\u22642 and no cycles (Lemma 6 and prior acyclicity) \u21d2 disjoint union of paths; trivially 3-colorable.\n- For C5: w\u22653 (by acyclicity), pathwidth \u22642, DP decides 3-colorability correctly.\n\nNext steps\n- Move Lemmas 5\u20139 and Proposition 9.1 into proofs.md with full details. Implement: (i) list/count DP; (ii) pivot+2-SAT with f_y by Lemma 9; measure w and cc(N(x)) on random/benchmark datasets.\n- Explore whether \u03c9 or cc(N(x)) are typically small in practice, making pivot method efficient; test balanced separator recursion vs. DP.\n- Structural: investigate w=3 class; is there a polynomial-time 3-coloring algorithm specialized to pathwidth 2 beyond brute-force DP? Potential for improved constants via bag-permutation pruning.\n- Hardness: develop realizable palette and wire gadgets respecting circle representation; start from the palette triangle and the simple \u201cforbid color i\u201d and \u201cforce color i\u201d connectors (both realizable by chord crossings), then build equality/NAE gadgets incrementally."
