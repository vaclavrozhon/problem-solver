  "content": "Overview\nWe strengthen and clean several structural lemmas and algorithmic subroutines, provide full proofs (balanced separator, bag-permutation, degeneracy), and formalize a complete 2-SAT reduction for the bipartite-sides pivot extension (under a fixed 2-coloring of N(x)). We also correct the earlier \u201coct \u2264 1\u201d claim by giving a sufficient condition and a concrete counterexample to necessity.\n\n1) Structural lemmas and proofs\nLemma 1 (Bags are permutation graphs). Let the circle be cut into open intervals I(v)=(s(v),t(v)) with endpoints all distinct and adjacency = overlap without containment. Fix an elementary segment \u03c3 between consecutive endpoints. Let B(\u03c3) be the set of intervals covering \u03c3. Then G[B(\u03c3)] is a permutation graph.\nProof. Every y \u2208 B(\u03c3) has s(y) < \u03c3 < t(y). Place the points to the left of \u03c3 (in increasing order) on a top line and the points to the right of \u03c3 (in increasing order) on a bottom line. Map y to a segment joining s(y) on the top line to t(y) on the bottom line. For y,z \u2208 B(\u03c3), they intersect in the overlap graph iff their endpoints alternate s(y)<s(z)<t(y)<t(z) or s(z)<s(y)<t(z)<t(y), which is equivalent to inversion between the two orders and hence segment crossing. Thus G[B(\u03c3)] is a permutation graph.\n\nLemma 2 (Balanced separator via sweep). Let the endpoints be sorted and \u03c3 range over elementary segments. Define a(\u03c3):=|{v : t(v) \u2264 \u03c3}| and c(\u03c3):=|{v : s(v) \u2265 \u03c3}|. Then there exists \u03c3 with a(\u03c3) \u2208 [n/3, 2n/3] and |B(\u03c3)| \u2265 1; for such \u03c3 we have max(a(\u03c3), c(\u03c3)) \u2264 2n/3. Hence removing B(\u03c3) separates the graph into two induced subgraphs of size \u2264 2n/3.\nProof. As \u03c3 sweeps from before the first start to after the last end, a(\u03c3) increases from 0 to n by unit steps. By the discrete intermediate value property, there is \u03c3 with a(\u03c3) \u2208 [n/3, 2n/3]. Between the first start and the last end, every elementary segment is covered by at least one interval, hence |B(\u03c3)| \u2265 1. Then c(\u03c3) = n \u2212 a(\u03c3) \u2212 |B(\u03c3)| \u2264 n \u2212 n/3 \u2212 1 \u2264 2n/3, and similarly a(\u03c3) \u2264 2n/3 by choice. Removing B(\u03c3) disconnects vertices ending before \u03c3 from those starting after \u03c3; this is the standard separation property of path decompositions.\n\nLemma 3 (Degeneracy \u2264 2w\u22122). If the ply is w (i.e., max_\u03c3 |B(\u03c3)| = w), then the overlap graph is (2w\u22122)-degenerate.\nProof. Order vertices by increasing right endpoint t. Consider a vertex b at its start s(b). Among earlier-start vertices, at most w\u22121 intervals are active at any point in the open segment just to the right of s(b); all earlier-start neighbors of b must be active at some point in (s(b), t(b)), so there are \u2264 w\u22121 of them. Symmetrically, consider just to the left of t(b): among later-start vertices, at most w\u22121 are active there, and any later-start neighbor must be active in (s(b), t(b)) and end after t(b), hence counted among these. Thus deg(b) \u2264 (w\u22121)+(w\u22121)=2w\u22122 in every induced subgraph obtained by repeatedly removing the minimum-t vertex. Hence degeneracy \u2264 2w\u22122.\n\n2) DP extensions (lists and counting) parameterized by ply w\nTheorem 4 (List-coloring and counting). Given a chord representation of ply w and lists L(v) \u2286 [k], one can decide list-k-colorability and count the number of list-respecting k-colorings in time O(n\u00b7w\u00b7k^w) and space O(k^w).\nProof. Use the sweep DP that maintains the colors of the active set ordered by increasing right endpoint. At a start s(b), determine the insertion position j by t-order; the set of earlier-start neighbors is the prefix 1..(j\u22121). Extensions are allowed colors in L(b) \\\n {colors used in the prefix}. Counting aggregates over choices for b; list-feasibility prunes choices. End events pop the leftmost active. Complexity and correctness follow identically to the non-list case; counts of identical states are accumulated.\n\n3) Pivot x: computing side-interface S(y) fast\nLemma 5 (Prefix computation of S(\u00b7)). Fix a pivot chord x with arcs A_L, A_R and a fixed 2-coloring of each component of G[N(x)] into {a,b}. For y \u2208 L, S(y) \u2286 {a,b} is the set of colors that appear among neighbors of y in N(x) (equivalently, colors of u_z on A_L with u_z \u2208 the interval of y). Then S(y) for all y \u2208 L can be computed in O(|L|+|N(x)|) time by binary-marked prefix sums along A_L; similarly for R.\nProof. Enumerate endpoints u_z of z\u2208N(x) on A_L in circular order and set two binary arrays marking presence of color a or b at each position. Build prefix sums P_a, P_b. For y with endpoints (\u2113(y), r(y)) on A_L, we have a \u2208 S(y) iff P_a(r(y)) \u2212 P_a(\u2113(y)) > 0, similarly for b. Total time is linear in arc size.\n\n4) Bipartite-sides extension via 2-SAT (complete and exact under fixed N(x)-2-coloring)\nSetup. Fix pivot x and its color c_x, and fix a 2-coloring of each component of G[N(x)] with colors a,b. Let H be a connected side-subgraph (either L or R) that is bipartite with a fixed bipartition (P,Q). For y \u2208 V(H), S(y) \u2286 {a,b} is computed as in Lemma 5.\nVariables. Introduce one boolean o_H (orientation) with semantics: o_H=0 means assign color a to P and b to Q; o_H=1 means assign b to P and a to Q. For each y \u2208 V(H), introduce z_y with semantics: z_y=1 iff y is assigned color c_x.\nClauses.\n- Independence of c_x: For every edge uv \u2208 E(H), add (\u00acz_u \u2228 \u00acz_v).\n- For y \u2208 P: if a \u2208 S(y), add (o_H \u2228 z_y); if b \u2208 S(y), add (\u00aco_H \u2228 z_y).\n- For y \u2208 Q: if b \u2208 S(y), add (o_H \u2228 z_y); if a \u2208 S(y), add (\u00aco_H \u2228 z_y).\nLet F(H) be the conjunction of these 2-clauses.\n\nTheorem 6 (Exact 2-SAT reduction for bipartite side). With the above construction and fixed N(x)-2-coloring and c_x, H admits an extension to a proper 3-coloring iff F(H) is satisfiable.\nProof. (\u21d2) Suppose a proper extension exists. Define o_H according to the a/b colors used on the 2-coloring of H\u2019s bipartition in the extension; set z_y=1 iff y is colored c_x. If y \u2208 P and o_H=0, then y is assigned a if z_y=0; since the extension is proper, a \u2209 S(y) whenever z_y=0, so the clause (o_H \u2228 z_y) is satisfied (either o_H=1 or z_y=1) when a \u2208 S(y); symmetrically for other cases. Any edge uv with z_u=z_v=1 is impossible in a proper coloring, hence (\u00acz_u \u2228 \u00acz_v) holds. Thus the assignment satisfies F(H).\n(\u21d0) Conversely, suppose F(H) is satisfiable. Use the satisfying assignment to color: vertices with z_y=1 get c_x; vertices with z_y=0 get a/b according to o_H and their side in (P,Q). Edges with both endpoints z=0 are properly 2-colored by construction. Edges with one endpoint z=1 are properly colored with distinct colors. Edges with both z=1 do not occur by the independence clauses. For any y with z_y=0, the gating clause guarantees that its assigned a/b color is not forbidden by S(y), so edges to N(x) are proper. Hence we obtain a valid extension on H.\nComplexity. For a fixed N(x)-coloring and c_x, F(H) has O(|E(H)|+|V(H)|) 2-clauses and is solvable in linear time. Different side components are independent; solve F(H) per component and combine.\nRemark. This formulation strictly generalizes the earlier \u201cviolators must be independent\u201d criterion: it allows z_y=1 even when y is not a violator, provided independence holds.\n\nCorollary 7 (Full pivot algorithm under bipartite sides). For a fixed pivot x, try c_x \u2208 {1,2,3} and for each connected component of G[N(x)] try both 2-colorings. For each side component H, build F(H) and test satisfiability. If all sides succeed, accept. Overall time O(3 \u00b7 2^{cc(N(x))} \u00b7 poly(n)) for fixed x; try all x to be complete under the \u201csome pivot with bipartite sides\u201d hypothesis.\n\n5) Correction on the oct \u2264 1 extension claim\nWe correct the earlier bidirectional claim; below is a sufficient condition with proof, and a counterexample to necessity.\n\nProposition 8 (Sufficient condition with single deletion). Let H be a side component and fix N(x)-2-coloring and c_x. If there exists v \u2208 V(H) and an orientation o of H\u2032:=H\u2212{v} such that the set B_o(H\u2032) of vertices y \u2208 V(H\u2032) whose assigned a/b color under o lies in S(y) is independent in H\u2032 and N_H(v) \u2229 B_o(H\u2032) = \u2205, then H admits an extension: color v and B_o(H\u2032) with c_x and V(H\u2032)\\B_o(H\u2032) by o.\nProof. Identical to the \u201cif\u201d direction of prior statements; edges within B_o(H\u2032) are absent (independence), edges incident to v avoid B_o(H\u2032) by assumption, and all remaining edges are properly colored.\n\nCounterexample to necessity. Take H=C_5 with vertices v1\u2013v2\u2013v3\u2013v4\u2013v5\u2013v1. Fix N(x)-2-coloring so that S(v1)=S(v3)=S(v5)={a,b} (forced c_x), S(v2)={a}, and S(v4)={b}. Then H is extendable (assign c_x to v1,v3,v5; color v2 with b and v4 with a). However, for any choice of v, either H\u2212{v} yields B_o(H\u2032) containing a neighbor of v (e.g., v1\u2019s neighbor v5 forced into B) or yields B_o(H\u2032) non-independent (e.g., deleting v2 leaves v1 and v5 both in B_o(H\u2032) with an edge between them). Thus no v satisfies the sufficient condition, showing the condition is not necessary.\n\n6) Examples and sanity checks\n- Bag-permutation: Build four intervals covering a segment \u03c3 with orders s: a<b<c<d and t: d<c<b<a; all pairs in B(\u03c3) are adjacent; K4 is a permutation graph.\n- Degeneracy: A construction with w=3 can realize a vertex of degree 4=2w\u22122 (tight up to constants) by placing two earlier- and two later-start neighbors active across (s(b),t(b)).\n- Side 2-SAT: For H a path u\u2013v\u2013w with bipartition P={u,w}, Q={v} and S(u)={a}, S(v)=\u2205, S(w)={b}, the formula consists of (o_H \u2228 z_u), (\u00aco_H \u2228 z_w), and (\u00acz_u \u2228 \u00acz_v), (\u00acz_v \u2228 \u00acz_w), (\u00acz_u \u2228 \u00acz_w). It is satisfiable (e.g., o_H=0, z_u=1, z_v=z_w=0) and yields a valid extension.\n\n7) Obstacles\n- Eliminating the 2^{cc(N(x))} factor by a single 2-SAT over all N(x)-component 2-colorings fails in general: whether a side vertex\u2019s color a (or b) \u201cappears\u201d is an OR over literals tied to multiple N(x)-components, inducing clauses of width \u2265 3 when guarding edge constraints across side edges.\n- The oct \u2264 1 sufficient test is not necessary; general completeness for oct \u2264 t by branching on |X| \u2264 t independent odd-cycle transversals is nontrivial due to the interaction with S(\u00b7) and may require larger c_x-sets than a minimum OCT.\n\n8) Next steps\n- Move proofs of Lemmas 1\u20133 and Theorem 4 into proofs.md; add Corollary 7 with the exact 2-SAT mapping.\n- Implement: (i) list/counting DP; (ii) pivot algorithm with side 2-SAT; (iii) prefix-sums computation of S(\u00b7).\n- Empirics: measure w, cc(N(x)), and frequency of pivots with bipartite sides on random and structured circle graphs.\n- Two-pivot separators: develop a four-region decomposition around chords x,y; the middle layer N(x)\u2229N(y) is permutation (hereditary), suggesting a bounded-interface CSP composition generalizing Theorem 6.\n- Parameterized exploration: attempt an FPT algorithm parameterized by (t + cc(N(x))) that branches on at most t independent deletions per side and then applies the 2-SAT extension (sufficient method), with attention to counterexamples and completeness gaps.\n\nSummary\n- Rigorous proofs: bag-permutation lemma; balanced separator with corrected bound; degeneracy \u2264 2w\u22122; list/counting DP in O(n\u00b7w\u00b7k^w).\n- Algorithmic: exact 2-SAT formulation for bipartite side extension under a fixed N(x)-2-coloring (stronger and cleaner than the \u201cindependent violators\u201d criterion) and linear-time computation of S(y).\n- Correction: the proposed oct \u2264 1 characterization is only sufficient, not necessary; provided a concrete counterexample illustrating the failure of necessity."
