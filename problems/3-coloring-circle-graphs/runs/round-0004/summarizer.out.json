  "summary_md": "This round consolidated structural and algorithmic progress on 3\u2011coloring circle graphs. Cutting the circle yields an interval-overlap model (adjacency = overlap without containment). For any chord x, G[N(x)] is a permutation graph (hence N(x) and N(x)\u2229N(y) are permutation), so N(x) must be bipartite in any 3\u2011coloring. A sweep-line DP / path-decomposition gives k\u2011colorability in O(n\u00b7w\u00b7k^w) time and O(k^w) space (w = interval ply), extending to list-coloring and counting; pathwidth \u2264 w\u22121 and degeneracy \u2264 2w\u22122 (w\u22642 \u21d2 forest). Pivoting on a chord x yields an exact 2\u2011SAT formulation for bipartite sides; branching over 2\u2011colorings of N(x)-components gives overall FPT behavior with a 2^{cc(N(x))} factor. Further corollaries: balanced sweep separator of size \u2264 w and \u03c9(G) \u2264 w computable in O(n\u00b7w\u00b7log w). Limits: Ageev\u2019s triangle-free \u03c7=5 examples, ply may be \u0398(n).
