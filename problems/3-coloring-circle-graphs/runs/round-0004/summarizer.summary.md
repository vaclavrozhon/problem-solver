This round consolidated structural and algorithmic progress on 3‑coloring circle graphs. Cutting the circle yields an interval-overlap model (adjacency = overlap without containment). For any chord x, G[N(x)] is a permutation graph (hence N(x) and N(x)∩N(y) are permutation), so N(x) must be bipartite in any 3‑coloring. A sweep-line DP / path-decomposition gives k‑colorability in O(n·w·k^w) time and O(k^w) space (w = interval ply), extending to list-coloring and counting; pathwidth ≤ w−1 and degeneracy ≤ 2w−2 (w≤2 ⇒ forest). Pivoting on a chord x yields an exact 2‑SAT formulation for bipartite sides; branching over 2‑colorings of N(x)-components gives overall FPT behavior with a 2^{cc(N(x))} factor. Further corollaries: balanced sweep separator of size ≤ w and ω(G) ≤ w computable in O(n·w·log w). Limits: Ageev’s triangle-free χ=5 examples, ply may be Θ(n).
