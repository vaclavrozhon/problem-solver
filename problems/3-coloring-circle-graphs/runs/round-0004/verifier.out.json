  "feedback_md": "Overall, the round makes solid, auditable progress on structural facts and implementable subroutines. Key points and rigor checks:\n\n- DP parameterized by ply w: All provers\u2019 variants are correct and equivalent to standard DP over the path decomposition formed by sweep bags. Present the unified bound O(n\u00b7w\u00b7k^w) time, O(k^w) space (Prover 2\u2019s O(n\u00b7k^{w+1}) also fits this up to constants). The list-coloring and counting extensions follow with the same complexity. Ensure introduce steps compute adjacency against the prefix by right-end order; forget steps project states; reconstruction is straightforward.\n\n- Bags are permutation graphs: Correct. This strengthens local structure beyond neighborhoods and can be used for pruning or exact bag-level subroutines.\n\n- Balanced separator by sweep: The proof is now correct provided you explicitly use |B(\u03c3)| \u2265 1 between the first start and last end to conclude c(\u03c3) \u2264 2n/3. Good to keep the precise definition of a(i), b(i), c(i) and the path-decomposition separation property.\n\n- Degeneracy \u2264 2w\u22122: Correct (both \u201cmin t\u201d and \u201cmin s\u201d proofs are fine). The corollary m \u2264 (w\u22121)n is then immediate. For w \u2264 2, a forest with \u0394 \u2264 2 is indeed a disjoint union of paths.\n\n- Helly-type clique property in overlap graphs: Prover 1\u2019s lemma is correct; any clique of overlaps (no containment) is pairwise intersecting, hence has a common point; thus \u03c9(G) \u2264 w and \u03c9(G)=max_\u03c3 \u03c9(G[B(\u03c3)]). This is useful and rigorous.\n\n- Computing \u03c9(G): With bags as permutation graphs, \u03c9(G[B(\u03c3)]) equals the length of a longest decreasing subsequence under the two orders; scanning all \u03c3 gives O(n\u00b7w\u00b7log w) total time since \u2211\u03c3 |B(\u03c3)| \u2264 O(nw). This is correct.\n\n- Pivot side-extension via 2-SAT: The explicit 2-CNF encoding with orientation variable o per side component and variable z_y per vertex (color-3 usage) is correct and exactly captures extendability for bipartite sides under a fixed 2-coloring of N(x). Computing S(y) in linear time per side via prefix sums is correct. The necessity of branching over 2^{cc(N(x))} orientations of N(x) remains; attempts to fold all choices into one 2-CNF fail due to gated parity/OR constraints.\n\n- Correction on oct \u2264 1: The earlier iff claim is not established; keep only the sufficient condition (and/or an FPT branching scheme). The counterexample illustrates why necessity can fail (even abstractly at the side level). Do not promote an equivalence here.\n\nConcrete next steps:\n- Move the Helly/clique lemma, \u03c9(G)=max over bags, and the precise 2-SAT side-extension theorem (with clauses) into proofs.md (done below). Unify DP statements and bounds.\n- Implement: (i) ply-DP (lists and counting); (ii) pivot+2-SAT with linear-time S(y) computation; benchmark w and cc(N(x)) distributions and runtime.\n- Explore two-pivot separators and whether a similar orientation+2-SAT scheme works with the middle layer N(x)\u2229N(y) (permutation) and four sides.\n- Parameterized extension: branch on a small independent set of additional z=1 per side (t) after forced ones, then solve 2-SAT; report empirical t.\n- Hardness: continue gadget search respecting chord realizability, especially in K4-free instances.\n",

Any clique S in the overlap graph (intervals intersect pairwise and do not contain each other) has a nonempty common intersection \u22c2_{x\u2208S} (s(x), t(x)). Consequently, \u03c9(G) \u2264 w (ply), and moreover \u03c9(G) = max_\u03c3 \u03c9(G[B(\u03c3)]) where \u03c3 ranges over elementary segments and B(\u03c3) is the active set at \u03c3.\n\n- Computing \u03c9(G). Since each bag induces a permutation graph, \u03c9(G[B(\u03c3)]) equals the length of a longest decreasing subsequence under the left/right endpoint orders and can be computed in O(|B(\u03c3)| log |B(\u03c3)|). Summing over all \u03c3 yields O(n\u00b7w\u00b7log w) total time (as \u2211\u03c3 |B(\u03c3)| = O(nw)).\n\n- Exact 2-SAT side extension (bipartite sides). For a pivot x, a fixed color c_x, and a fixed 2-coloring of each component of N(x), each bipartite side component H reduces to a 2-SAT instance with orientation variable o_H and per-vertex variables z_y (use of c_x). Clauses enforce that adjacent z=1 are forbidden and that any side vertex with z_y=0 avoids forbidden side colors given by S(y). This exactly captures extendability per side; the two sides are independent.\n\n- Caution on oct \u2264 1. The earlier bidirectional claim is not valid; a sufficient condition remains (delete at most one vertex v per side component and require independence of the violator set away from v), but it is not necessary. Treat further extensions via branching/FPT.\n\nImplementation checklist: integrate \u03c9-computation routine; implement ply-DP (lists/counting); implement pivot+2-SAT with linear-time S(y); measure w and cc(N(x)) on benchmarks."

    "content": "Lemma (Helly-type property for overlap cliques).\nLet {I(x)=(s(x),t(x))} be open intervals on a line and let G be their overlap graph (edges between pairs that intersect without containment). If S \u2286 V(G) is a clique, then \u22c2_{x\u2208S} (s(x), t(x)) \u2260 \u2205.\nProof. Since overlaps imply intersections, intervals in S are pairwise intersecting. Intervals on a line satisfy the Helly property with Helly number 2, hence the intersection over all members is nonempty. For completeness: order S by increasing starts s(x_1) < \u2026 < s(x_k). From x_1 \u223c x_k we have s(x_1) < s(x_k) < t(x_1) < t(x_k). For any i, x_1 \u223c x_i and x_i \u223c x_k give s(x_i) < t(x_1) and s(x_k) < t(x_i). Choose p with s(x_k) < p < t(x_1); then p \u2208 (s(x_i), t(x_i)) for all i. \u220e\n\nCorollary (Clique number via sweep bags; bound by ply).\nFor a circle graph G represented as above and any elementary segment \u03c3, let B(\u03c3) be the set of intervals covering \u03c3. Then \u03c9(G) = max_\u03c3 \u03c9(G[B(\u03c3)]) and \u03c9(G) \u2264 max_\u03c3 |B(\u03c3)| = w.\nProof. By the lemma, any clique S has a common point p, hence S \u2286 B(\u03c3) for any \u03c3 containing p, so \u03c9(G) \u2264 max_\u03c3 \u03c9(G[B(\u03c3)]). The reverse inequality is trivial since G[B(\u03c3)] is an induced subgraph. The bound by ply is immediate from \u03c9(G[B(\u03c3)]) \u2264 |B(\u03c3)| and maximizing over \u03c3. \u220e\n\nLemma (Clique number of a permutation bag via LIS/LDS).\nIf H is a permutation graph given by two total orders of its vertex set, then \u03c9(H) equals the length of a longest decreasing subsequence when one order is viewed as a permutation of the other.\nProof. In a permutation representation, vertices correspond to segments between two parallel lines; two vertices are adjacent iff the corresponding segments cross, i.e., the relative order of their endpoints is inverted. A set of vertices forms a clique iff every pair crosses, i.e., their endpoints are strictly decreasing in one order relative to the other. Thus cliques correspond exactly to decreasing subsequences. \u220e\n\nProposition (Computing \u03c9(G) in O(n\u00b7w\u00b7log w)).\nWith notation as above, \u03c9(G) = max_\u03c3 \u03c9(G[B(\u03c3)]). For each \u03c3, compute \u03c9(G[B(\u03c3)]) by the longest decreasing subsequence of the permutation induced by the two orders on B(\u03c3) in O(|B(\u03c3)| log |B(\u03c3)|) time. Since |B(\u03c3)| \u2264 w and there are O(n) segments, and \u2211_\u03c3 |B(\u03c3)| = O(nw), the total time is O(n\u00b7w\u00b7log w). \u220e\n\nTheorem (Exact 2-SAT reduction for bipartite side extension).\nFix a pivot chord x and a color c_x \u2208 {1,2,3}. Suppose G[N(x)] is bipartite and a proper 2-coloring with colors {a,b} = {1,2,3}\\{c_x} is fixed on each component. Let H be a connected side-subgraph (either L or R) that is bipartite with bipartition (P,Q). For each y \u2208 V(H), let S(y) \u2286 {a,b} be the set of colors appearing among neighbors of y in N(x) (computable by prefix sums along the side arc). Build a 2-CNF F(H) with variables: an orientation o_H and z_y for each y, with clauses:\n- (Independence) For every edge uv \u2208 E(H): (\u00acz_u \u2228 \u00acz_v).\n- (Avoid forbidden side colors) If y \u2208 P: if a \u2208 S(y) then (o_H \u2228 z_y); if b \u2208 S(y) then (\u00aco_H \u2228 z_y). If y \u2208 Q: if b \u2208 S(y) then (o_H \u2228 z_y); if a \u2208 S(y) then (\u00aco_H \u2228 z_y).\nThen H admits an extension to a proper 3-coloring (assigning c_x to some vertices and a/b to the rest, consistent with the fixed coloring of N(x)) iff F(H) is satisfiable.\nProof. (\u21d2) From an extension, set z_y=1 iff y has color c_x and set o_H to match the a/b assignment on (P,Q); all clauses hold: independence forbids adjacent z=1, and gating clauses ensure any y with z_y=0 does not receive a forbidden side color. (\u21d0) From a satisfying assignment, color z_y=1 vertices by c_x and the remaining vertices in P by (a if \u00aco_H, b if o_H) and in Q by (b if \u00aco_H, a if o_H). Independence guarantees no edge is monochromatic c_x; gating clauses ensure edges to N(x) are proper. Thus we obtain a valid extension. \u220e\n\nCorollary (Pivot algorithm under bipartite sides). For a chosen pivot x, trying c_x \u2208 {1,2,3} and the two 2-colorings per connected component of G[N(x)], solve F(H) for each side component H independently; accept if all sides succeed. Total time per pivot is O(3\u00b72^{cc(N(x))}\u00b7poly(n)). \u220e"
