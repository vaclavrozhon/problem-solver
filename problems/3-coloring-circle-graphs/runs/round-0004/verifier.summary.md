Verified: DP over sweep/path decomposition (O(n·w·k^w)) for decision/lists/counting; bags are permutation graphs; balanced separator (size ≤ w) with corrected proof; degeneracy ≤ 2w−2 and m ≤ (w−1)n; Helly-type clique lemma implying ω(G) ≤ w and ω(G)=max_σ ω(G[B(σ)]); ω(G) computable in O(n·w·log w). Exact 2-SAT side-extension for bipartite sides under fixed N(x) 2-coloring; linear-time S(y) computation. The oct ≤ 1 criterion is only sufficient. Verdict: uncertain.
