{"feedback_md":"Overall, the round makes solid, auditable progress on structural facts and implementable subroutines. Key points and rigor checks:\n\n- DP parameterized by ply w: All provers’ variants are correct and equivalent to standard DP over the path decomposition formed by sweep bags. Present the unified bound O(n·w·k^w) time, O(k^w) space (Prover 2’s O(n·k^{w+1}) also fits this up to constants). The list-coloring and counting extensions follow with the same complexity. Ensure introduce steps compute adjacency against the prefix by right-end order; forget steps project states; reconstruction is straightforward.\n\n- Bags are permutation graphs: Correct. This strengthens local structure beyond neighborhoods and can be used for pruning or exact bag-level subroutines.\n\n- Balanced separator by sweep: The proof is now correct provided you explicitly use |B(σ)| ≥ 1 between the first start and last end to conclude c(σ) ≤ 2n/3. Good to keep the precise definition of a(i), b(i), c(i) and the path-decomposition separation property.\n\n- Degeneracy ≤ 2w−2: Correct (both “min t” and “min s” proofs are fine). The corollary m ≤ (w−1)n is then immediate. For w ≤ 2, a forest with Δ ≤ 2 is indeed a disjoint union of paths.\n\n- Helly-type clique property in overlap graphs: Prover 1’s lemma is correct; any clique of overlaps (no containment) is pairwise intersecting, hence has a common point; thus ω(G) ≤ w and ω(G)=max_σ ω(G[B(σ)]). This is useful and rigorous.\n\n- Computing ω(G): With bags as permutation graphs, ω(G[B(σ)]) equals the length of a longest decreasing subsequence under the two orders; scanning all σ gives O(n·w·log w) total time since ∑σ |B(σ)| ≤ O(nw). This is correct.\n\n- Pivot side-extension via 2-SAT: The explicit 2-CNF encoding with orientation variable o per side component and variable z_y per vertex (color-3 usage) is correct and exactly captures extendability for bipartite sides under a fixed 2-coloring of N(x). Computing S(y) in linear time per side via prefix sums is correct. The necessity of branching over 2^{cc(N(x))} orientations of N(x) remains; attempts to fold all choices into one 2-CNF fail due to gated parity/OR constraints.\n\n- Correction on oct ≤ 1: The earlier iff claim is not established; keep only the sufficient condition (and/or an FPT branching scheme). The counterexample illustrates why necessity can fail (even abstractly at the side level). Do not promote an equivalence here.\n\nConcrete next steps:\n- Move the Helly/clique lemma, ω(G)=max over bags, and the precise 2-SAT side-extension theorem (with clauses) into proofs.md (done below). Unify DP statements and bounds.\n- Implement: (i) ply-DP (lists and counting); (ii) pivot+2-SAT with linear-time S(y) computation; benchmark w and cc(N(x)) distributions and runtime.\n- Explore two-pivot separators and whether a similar orientation+2-SAT scheme works with the middle layer N(x)∩N(y) (permutation) and four sides.\n- Parameterized extension: branch on a small independent set of additional z=1 per side (t) after forced ones, then solve 2-SAT; report empirical t.\n- Hardness: continue gadget search respecting chord realizability, especially in K4-free instances.\n","summary_md":"Verified: DP over sweep/path decomposition (O(n·w·k^w)) for decision/lists/counting; bags are permutation graphs; balanced separator (size ≤ w) with corrected proof; degeneracy ≤ 2w−2 and m ≤ (w−1)n; Helly-type clique lemma implying ω(G) ≤ w and ω(G)=max_σ ω(G[B(σ)]); ω(G) computable in O(n·w·log w).

Any clique S in the overlap graph (intervals intersect pairwise and do not contain each other) has a nonempty common intersection ⋂_{x∈S} (s(x), t(x)). Consequently, ω(G) ≤ w (ply), and moreover ω(G) = max_σ ω(G[B(σ)]) where σ ranges over elementary segments and B(σ) is the active set at σ.\n\n- Computing ω(G). Since each bag induces a permutation graph, ω(G[B(σ)]) equals the length of a longest decreasing subsequence under the left/right endpoint orders and can be computed in O(|B(σ)| log |B(σ)|). Summing over all σ yields O(n·w·log w) total time (as ∑σ |B(σ)| = O(nw)).\n\n- Exact 2-SAT side extension (bipartite sides). For a pivot x, a fixed color c_x, and a fixed 2-coloring of each component of N(x), each bipartite side component H reduces to a 2-SAT instance with orientation variable o_H and per-vertex variables z_y (use of c_x). Clauses enforce that adjacent z=1 are forbidden and that any side vertex with z_y=0 avoids forbidden side colors given by S(y). This exactly captures extendability per side; the two sides are independent.\n\n- Caution on oct ≤ 1. The earlier bidirectional claim is not valid; a sufficient condition remains (delete at most one vertex v per side component and require independence of the violator set away from v), but it is not necessary.

If S ⊆ V(G) is a clique, then ⋂_{x∈S} (s(x), t(x)) ≠ ∅.\nProof. Since overlaps imply intersections, intervals in S are pairwise intersecting. Intervals on a line satisfy the Helly property with Helly number 2, hence the intersection over all members is nonempty. For completeness: order S by increasing starts s(x_1) < … < s(x_k). From x_1 ∼ x_k we have s(x_1) < s(x_k) < t(x_1) < t(x_k). For any i, x_1 ∼ x_i and x_i ∼ x_k give s(x_i) < t(x_1) and s(x_k) < t(x_i). Choose p with s(x_k) < p < t(x_1); then p ∈ (s(x_i), t(x_i)) for all i. ∎\n\nCorollary (Clique number via sweep bags; bound by ply).\nFor a circle graph G represented as above and any elementary segment σ, let B(σ) be the set of intervals covering σ. Then ω(G) = max_σ ω(G[B(σ)]) and ω(G) ≤ max_σ |B(σ)| = w.\nProof. By the lemma, any clique S has a common point p, hence S ⊆ B(σ) for any σ containing p, so ω(G) ≤ max_σ ω(G[B(σ)]). The reverse inequality is trivial since G[B(σ)] is an induced subgraph. The bound by ply is immediate from ω(G[B(σ)]) ≤ |B(σ)| and maximizing over σ. ∎\n\nLemma (Clique number of a permutation bag via LIS/LDS).\nIf H is a permutation graph given by two total orders of its vertex set, then ω(H) equals the length of a longest decreasing subsequence when one order is viewed as a permutation of the other.\nProof. In a permutation representation, vertices correspond to segments between two parallel lines; two vertices are adjacent iff the corresponding segments cross, i.e., the relative order of their endpoints is inverted. A set of vertices forms a clique iff every pair crosses, i.e., their endpoints are strictly decreasing in one order relative to the other. Thus cliques correspond exactly to decreasing subsequences. ∎\n\nProposition (Computing ω(G) in O(n·w·log w)).\nWith notation as above, ω(G) = max_σ ω(G[B(σ)]). For each σ, compute ω(G[B(σ)]) by the longest decreasing subsequence of the permutation induced by the two orders on B(σ) in O(|B(σ)| log |B(σ)|) time. Since |B(σ)| ≤ w and there are O(n) segments, and ∑_σ |B(σ)| = O(nw), the total time is O(n·w·log w). ∎\n\nTheorem (Exact 2-SAT reduction for bipartite side extension).\nFix a pivot chord x and a color c_x ∈ {1,2,3}. Suppose G[N(x)] is bipartite and a proper 2-coloring with colors {a,b} = {1,2,3}\\{c_x} is fixed on each component. Let H be a connected side-subgraph (either L or R) that is bipartite with bipartition (P,Q). For each y ∈ V(H), let S(y) ⊆ {a,b} be the set of colors appearing among neighbors of y in N(x) (computable by prefix sums along the side arc). Build a 2-CNF F(H) with variables: an orientation o_H and z_y for each y, with clauses:\n- (Independence) For every edge uv ∈ E(H): (¬z_u ∨ ¬z_v).\n- (Avoid forbidden side colors) If y ∈ P: if a ∈ S(y) then (o_H ∨ z_y); if b ∈ S(y) then (¬o_H ∨ z_y). If y ∈ Q: if b ∈ S(y) then (o_H ∨ z_y); if a ∈ S(y) then (¬o_H ∨ z_y).\nThen H admits an extension to a proper 3-coloring (assigning c_x to some vertices and a/b to the rest, consistent with the fixed coloring of N(x)) iff F(H) is satisfiable.\nProof. (⇒) From an extension, set z_y=1 iff y has color c_x and set o_H to match the a/b assignment on (P,Q); all clauses hold: independence forbids adjacent z=1, and gating clauses ensure any y with z_y=0 does not receive a forbidden side color. (⇐) From a satisfying assignment, color z_y=1 vertices by c_x and the remaining vertices in P by (a if ¬o_H, b if o_H) and in Q by (b if ¬o_H, a if o_H). Independence guarantees no edge is monochromatic c_x; gating clauses ensure edges to N(x) are proper. Thus we obtain a valid extension. ∎\n\nCorollary (Pivot algorithm under bipartite sides). For a chosen pivot x, trying c_x ∈ {1,2,3} and the two 2-colorings per connected component of G[N(x)], solve F(H) for each side component H independently; accept if all sides succeed. Total time per pivot is O(3·2^{cc(N(x))}·poly(n)). ∎"},"output_update":null}
