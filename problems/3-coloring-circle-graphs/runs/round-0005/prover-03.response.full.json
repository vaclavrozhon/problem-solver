          "text": "{\"content\":\"New structural formulation of side extension and FPT branching\\n\\nIdea. For a fixed pivot chord x and a fixed 2-coloring of G[N(x)] with colors {a,b} (and c_x the third color), the question whether a side component H (in L or R) can be extended reduces exactly to selecting an independent set Z of vertices to receive color c_x so that H\u2212Z is bipartite and admits a 2-coloring by {a,b} consistent with the interface constraints S(\u00b7) from N(x). This yields a clean necessary-and-sufficient condition and a natural FPT branching scheme parameterized by |Z| (per side) plus cc(N(x)).\\n\\nPrecise formulation\\n- For each y \u2208 V(H), S(y) \u2286 {a,b} denotes the set of non-c_x colors that appear among neighbors of y in N(x) (computable in linear time per side by prefix sums along the side arc).\\n- For any orientation o (a 2-coloring) of a bipartite graph K with bipartition (P,Q), write o(y) \u2208 {a,b} for the color assigned to y.\\n\\nTheorem 1 (Exact side-extension criterion). Fix x, c_x, and a 2-coloring of each component of G[N(x)] into {a,b}, and let H be a side component. Then H admits an extension to a proper 3-coloring using {a,b,c_x} (respecting the fixed N(x)-colors) iff there exists an independent set Z \u2286 V(H) and a 2-coloring o of H\u2212Z such that:\\n- H\u2212Z is bipartite;\\n- For every y \u2208 V(H) \\\\ Z, we have o(y) \u2209 S(y).\\nWhen such (Z,o) exist, the coloring that assigns c_x to Z and o to V(H) \\\\ Z is a valid extension on H.\\nProof. (\u21d2) Let \u03c6 be a valid extension on H with colors in {a,b,c_x}. Take Z := {y \u2208 V(H) : \u03c6(y) = c_x}. Then Z is independent (otherwise an edge is monochromatic c_x), and H\u2212Z is 2-colored by {a,b} via o(y):=\u03c6(y). For any y \u2208 V(H) \\\\ Z with \u03c6(y) \u2208 {a,b}, no neighbor z \u2208 N(x) has \u03c6(z)=\u03c6(y), hence \u03c6(y) \u2209 S(y). Thus o(y) \u2209 S(y). (\u21d0) Given (Z,o), color Z by c_x and V(H) \\\\ Z by o. Edges inside V(H) \\\\ Z are properly 2-colored; edges incident to Z have distinct colors c_x vs a/b; edges inside Z do not exist by independence. For edges to N(x), if y \u2208 V(H) \\\\ Z, then o(y) \u2209 S(y) so no adjacent z \u2208 N(x) uses o(y). Hence the extension is proper.\\n\\nCorollary 2 (Reduction to bipartite list-2-coloring). For any fixed Z, testing the existence of o satisfying o(y) \u2209 S(y) for all y \u2208 V(H) \\\\ Z is equivalent to list-2-coloring on the bipartite graph H\u2212Z with lists L(y) := { c \u2208 {a,b} : c \u2209 S(y) }, solvable in linear time.\\n\\nAlgorithmic consequence: FPT branching by |Z|\\nProposition 3 (Side algorithm parameterized by |Z|). For a fixed pivot x, color c_x, and 2-coloring of G[N(x)], let t \u2265 0. If each side component H admits an independent set Z_H with |Z_H| \u2264 t satisfying Theorem 1, then G is 3-colorable. Conversely, the following algorithm decides extendability under this promise in time O(\u2211_H n_H^t \u00b7 poly(n_H)), where n_H := |V(H)|:\\n- For each side component H, enumerate all independent sets Z \u2286 V(H) of size \u2264 t (prune by adjacency). For each Z: check whether H\u2212Z is bipartite and whether list-2-coloring with lists L(y) := {a,b}\\\\S(y) is feasible; accept H if any Z passes.\\n- Accept the pivot choice if all side components are accepted; otherwise reject.\\nTrying all x, c_x, and both 2-colorings per N(x)-component yields overall O(n \u00b7 3 \u00b7 2^{cc(N(x))} \u00b7 n^t \u00b7 poly(n)) time.\\nCorrectness. Immediate from Theorem 1 and Corollary 2, with independence and bipartiteness checks per Z and linear-time 2-list-coloring.\\n\\nRemarks.\\n- This subsumes the earlier bipartite-sides case (choose Z as any independent set containing all \u201cviolators\u201d under some orientation) and the \u201coct \u2264 1\u201d sufficient condition (|Z| \u2264 1). It also clarifies why the earlier necessity attempt failed: forcing Z to split as {v} \u222a B_o(H\u2212{v}) is stronger than the existence of some Z meeting Theorem 1.\\n- The unknown complexity of selecting a minimum independent odd cycle transversal on circle graphs motivates the parameter t. Even a crude enumeration for small t is practical and auditable.\\n\\nStructural and computational additions\\nLemma 4 (Helly-type clique for overlaps; proof sketch). In the overlap model, any clique S is pairwise intersecting without containment, hence \u22c2_{x\u2208S}(s(x),t(x)) \u2260 \u2205. Therefore \u03c9(G) \u2264 w and \u03c9(G)=max_\u03c3 \u03c9(G[B(\u03c3)]). This enables computing \u03c9(G) in O(n\u00b7w\u00b7log w) via scanning \u03c3 and longest decreasing subsequence on permutation representations of B(\u03c3).\\nLemma 5 (Degeneracy bound). The graph is (2w\u22122)-degenerate; hence m \u2264 (w\u22121)n. Proof as in prior round (active-set argument near s(b) and t(b)).\\n\\nExample sanity check for Theorem 1\\n- Let H be a 5-cycle v1\u2013v2\u2013v3\u2013v4\u2013v5\u2013v1 with S(v1)=S(v3)=S(v5)={a,b}, S(v2)={a}, S(v4)={b}. Choose Z={v1,v3,v5} (independent). Then H\u2212Z is the 2-path v2\u2013v4, list-2-colorable with o(v2)=b, o(v4)=a, consistent with S(\u00b7). The extension exists as predicted.\\n\\nObstacles and limits\\n- Eliminating the 2^{cc(N(x))} factor: as argued earlier, side constraints \u201ccolor a appears at y\u201d become ORs over multiple N(x)-components; the resulting clauses have width \u2265 3, preventing a direct 2-SAT encoding without branching or additional structure.\\n- Independent OCT on circle graphs: the existence of polynomial or FPT algorithms (beyond naive n^t enumeration) is unclear; in general graphs, OCT is FPT but independence adds complexity. Our scheme remains an explicit, parameterized pathway.\\n\\nNext steps (auditable)\\n1) Implement the side algorithm with Theorem 1: for t=0 (pure bipartite sides) use the exact 2-SAT packaging; for t=1,2 enumerate Z and run bipartite list-2-coloring per candidate.\\n2) Integrate with the pivot loop over x, c_x, and 2-colorings of N(x); precompute S(\u00b7) via prefix sums per side.\\n3) Empirically profile distributions of cc(N(x)) and minimal t on random and crafted instances; seek pivots minimizing cc(N(x)) + t.\\n4) Explore two-pivot separators (x,y): four side regions plus middle permutation N(x)\u2229N(y); attempt to lift Theorem 1 to this partition with simultaneous independent sets Z in each region.\\n5) Hardness direction: formalize minimal gadgets where Z must be chosen from specified vertices to satisfy lists, approaching reductions from NAE-3SAT while preserving chord realizability.\\n\\nSummary\\n- Exact characterization (Theorem 1): side extension exists iff there is an independent set Z whose removal makes the side bipartite and list-2-colorable w.r.t. S(\u00b7). This unifies and corrects prior partial criteria.\\n- Algorithmic: an FPT scheme parameterized by t=|Z| per side plus cc(N(x)), with concrete, checkable subroutines (bipartiteness and bipartite list-2-coloring).\\n- Reinforced structural tools: Helly clique bound and \u03c9(G) computation; degeneracy \u2264 2w\u22122; both feed into analysis and heuristics.\"}",
