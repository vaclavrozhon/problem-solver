  "summary_md": "This round consolidated structural and algorithmic progress on 3\u2011coloring circle graphs. Cutting the circle gives an interval\u2011overlap model (adjacency = overlap without containment). For any chord x, G[N(x)] is a permutation graph and N(x)\u2229N(y) is permutation (hereditary). A sweep\u2011line DP / path decomposition yields k\u2011colorability in O(n\u00b7w\u00b7k^w) time and O(k^w) space (w = representation ply), extends to list\u2011coloring and counting; pathwidth \u2264 w\u22121 and degeneracy \u2264 2w\u22122; w\u22643 implies 3\u2011colorable. Pivoting on a chord x: fix 2\u2011colorings of N(x)-components and reduce each bipartite side to an exact 2\u2011SAT (orientation + z\u2011variables); branching over component 2\u2011colorings gives FPT behavior with a 2^{cc(N(x))} factor. \u03c9(G) \u2264 w and is computable in O(n\u00b7w\u00b7log w) via LIS per bag. Limits: Ageev\u2019s triangle\u2011free \u03c7=5 examples, ply can be \u0398(n), and collapsing the branching to a single 2\u2011SAT generally fails (except special \u201csingle\u2011touch\u201d cases).
