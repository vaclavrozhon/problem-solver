{"summary_md":"This round consolidated structural and algorithmic progress on 3‑coloring circle graphs. Cutting the circle gives an interval‑overlap model (adjacency = overlap without containment). For any chord x, G[N(x)] is a permutation graph and N(x)∩N(y) is permutation (hereditary). A sweep‑line DP / path decomposition yields k‑colorability in O(n·w·k^w) time and O(k^w) space (w = representation ply), extends to list‑coloring and counting; pathwidth ≤ w−1 and degeneracy ≤ 2w−2; w≤3 implies 3‑colorable. Pivoting on a chord x: fix 2‑colorings of N(x)-components and reduce each bipartite side to an exact 2‑SAT (orientation + z‑variables); branching over component 2‑colorings gives FPT behavior with a 2^{cc(N(x))} factor. ω(G) ≤ w and is computable in O(n·w·log w) via LIS per bag. Limits: Ageev’s triangle‑free χ=5 examples, ply can be Θ(n), and collapsing the branching to a single 2‑SAT generally fails (except special “single‑touch” cases).
