However, your closed form for the number of canonical states Q(t) is incorrect. The number of orbits equals S2(t,1)+S2(t,2)+S2(t,3) = (1/6)\u00b73^t + 1/2, not (1/6)\u00b73^t + (1/2)\u00b72^t + 1/3. Please correct. With this, the asymptotic 6\u00d7 reduction holds.\\n- Common-neighborhood test for adjacent chords: The necessity \u201cN(x)\u2229N(y) must be independent\u201d is correct. But the structural refinement is flawed: when x,y are adjacent and we split M into chords linking A1\u2013A3 vs A2\u2013A4 (four arcs around x,y), every chord from the first block intersects every chord from the second. Thus G[M] is independent iff at most one block is nonempty, and the nonempty block is inversion-free (monotone) in its permutation orders. Your monotonicity check per block alone is insufficient; it would incorrectly accept cases with both blocks nonempty. Please fix the statement and test.\\n- 2-SAT barrier: Your explanation that folding N(x)-component orientations into one 2-CNF forces 3-clauses via gated disjunctions is correct.\\n\\nProver 2\\n- New theorem \u201cply \u2264 3 implies 3-colorable\u201d is correct and important.

Please add a clear proof (we include a fully rigorous version in proofs.md).\\n- Consolidation of DP, Helly clique bound, and bipartite-sides 2-SAT packaging is sound.

Then G is 3-colorable. Moreover, a 3-coloring can be found in linear time after sorting endpoints.\\nProof. The bags B(\u03c3) of intervals covering each elementary segment \u03c3 form a path decomposition of G with width \u2264 w\u22121 \u2264 2. Hence treewidth(G) \u2264 2. Graphs of treewidth \u2264 2 are partial 2-trees and thus 3-colorable. Constructively, order vertices by the index of their last bag; fill each bag into a clique to obtain a chordal supergraph H with \u03c9(H) \u2264 3 and use greedy coloring along this perfect elimination order, yielding a 3-coloring of H and hence of G. Building H implicitly from the path decomposition makes the procedure linear after sorting. \u220e\\n\\nLemma (Structure of N(x)\u2229N(y) for adjacent x,y).\\nLet x,y be adjacent chords with s(x)<s(y)<t(x)<t(y) on the circle. Partition the circle into arcs A1=(s(x),s(y)), A2=(s(y),t(x)), A3=(t(x),t(y)), A4=(t(y),s(x)). Then every chord z \u2208 N(x)\u2229N(y) has one endpoint in A1\u222aA3 and the other in A2\u222aA4, and in fact z lies in exactly one of the two groups G13 (endpoints in A1 and A3) or G24 (endpoints in A2 and A4). Moreover, every z \u2208 G13 intersects every z\u2032 \u2208 G24. Consequently, G[N(x)\u2229N(y)] is independent iff at most one of G13,G24 is nonempty, and the nonempty group is inversion-free (no crossings) in its permutation orders.\\nProof. The crossing conditions with x and y force endpoints to be on opposite sides of each of {s(x),t(x)} and {s(y),t(y)}, yielding exactly the two opposite-arc pairs G13 and G24. Fix z\u2208G13 with endpoints p\u2208A1 and q\u2208A3, and z\u2032\u2208G24 with endpoints r\u2208A2 and s\u2208A4. In circular order we have p<r<q<s, so the endpoints alternate and z,z\u2032 cross. Within a fixed group, adjacency is determined by inversions between the two induced orders (permutation graph); independence is equivalent to monotone agreement (no inversions). \u220e\\n\\nProposition (Canonical-state reduction for 3-coloring DP on a bag).\\nLet B be a bag of size t in the sweep/path decomposition. Two colorings c1,c2: B\u2192{1,2,3} are equivalent if c2 = \u03c0\u2218c1 for some permutation \u03c0 of {1,2,3}. The endpoint-DP for plain 3-coloring can be carried out on equivalence classes, using a canonical representative canon(c): scan B in fixed order (e.g., increasing right endpoint) and relabel the first-seen color as 1, the next unseen color as 2, etc.\\n(i) Correctness: The DP recurrence depends only on color equality/inequality and thus is invariant under global color permutations; applying canon after each introduce/forget preserves the existence of extensions.\\n(ii) State count: The number of equivalence classes equals the number of set partitions of B into at most 3 blocks: Q(t) = S2(t,1)+S2(t,2)+S2(t,3) = (1/6)\u00b73^t + 1/2. Hence the DP runs in O(n\u00b7w\u00b7Q(w)) time and O(Q(w)) space, an asymptotic 6\u00d7 reduction over 3^w. This reduction does not apply when color names carry semantics (lists/precolors). \u220e\"},\"output_update\":null}",
