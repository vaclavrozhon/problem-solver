Accepted: ply ≤ 3 implies 3-colorability (constructive via path decomposition), exact side-extension criterion (independent Z + bipartite list-2-coloring), bag-permutation, balanced separator, degeneracy, ω(G) via bags. Fixed: P1’s canonical state count formula; corrected that for adjacent x,y, N(x)∩N(y) splits into two blocks with complete bipartite edges across, so independence requires one block empty. DP and pivot 2-SAT remain core tools. Verdict: uncertain.
