However, your closed form for the number of canonical states Q(t) is incorrect. The number of orbits equals S2(t,1)+S2(t,2)+S2(t,3) = (1/6)·3^t + 1/2, not (1/6)·3^t + (1/2)·2^t + 1/3. Please correct. With this, the asymptotic 6× reduction holds.\n- Common-neighborhood test for adjacent chords: The necessity “N(x)∩N(y) must be independent” is correct. But the structural refinement is flawed: when x,y are adjacent and we split M into chords linking A1–A3 vs A2–A4 (four arcs around x,y), every chord from the first block intersects every chord from the second. Thus G[M] is independent iff at most one block is nonempty, and the nonempty block is inversion-free (monotone) in its permutation orders. Your monotonicity check per block alone is insufficient; it would incorrectly accept cases with both blocks nonempty. Please fix the statement and test.\n- 2-SAT barrier: Your explanation that folding N(x)-component orientations into one 2-CNF forces 3-clauses via gated disjunctions is correct.\n\nProver 2\n- New theorem “ply ≤ 3 implies 3-colorable” is correct and important. From the sweep path decomposition, pathwidth ≤ 2 implies treewidth ≤ 2 (partial 2-tree), hence χ ≤ 3. The constructive coloring via filling each bag to a clique and greedily coloring a perfect elimination order is valid and linear after sorting endpoints. Please add a clear proof (we include a fully rigorous version in proofs.md).\n- Consolidation of DP, Helly clique bound, and bipartite-sides 2-SAT packaging is sound. Minor: present the DP bound uniformly as O(n·w·k^w) (your O(n·k^{w+1}) fits this up to constants).\n\nProver 3\n- Exact side-extension criterion (exists independent Z so that H−Z is bipartite and list-2-colorable with lists {a,b}\\S(y)) is correct and clean. It unifies previous sufficient conditions and justifies an FPT branching scheme in |Z| per side plus cc(N(x)).\n- Proofs for bag-permutation, balanced separator, and degeneracy are correct and consistent with earlier notes.

The sweep bags B(σ) give a path decomposition of width ≤ w−1. If w ≤ 3, then pathwidth ≤ 2 (hence treewidth ≤ 2), so G is a partial 2-tree and thus 3-colorable. Constructively, fill each bag to a clique and greedily color along a perfect elimination order; runtime linear after sorting endpoints.\n\n- Canonical-state DP (plain 3-coloring). For bag size t, quotient colorings by global color permutations using first-appearance renaming. The number of canonical states is Q(t)=S2(t,1)+S2(t,2)+S2(t,3)=(1/6)·3^t+1/2, yielding ~6× state reduction vs 3^t. This applies only when color names carry no semantics (no lists/precolors).\n\n- Adjacent pair common neighborhood. For adjacent chords x,y with endpoints in order s(x)<s(y)<t(x)<t(y), the set M=N(x)∩N(y) splits into two groups by opposite arcs: A1–A3 and A2–A4. Every chord from the first group intersects every chord from the second (complete bipartite across groups). Therefore G[M] is independent iff at most one group is nonempty; independence within the nonempty group is equivalent to monotonicity (no inversions) in its permutation orders.\n\n- Exact side-extension criterion (pivot x, fixed 2-coloring of N(x)).

Then G is 3-colorable. Moreover, a 3-coloring can be found in linear time after sorting endpoints.\nProof. The bags B(σ) of intervals covering each elementary segment σ form a path decomposition of G with width ≤ w−1 ≤ 2. Hence treewidth(G) ≤ 2. Graphs of treewidth ≤ 2 are partial 2-trees and thus 3-colorable. Constructively, order vertices by the index of their last bag; fill each bag into a clique to obtain a chordal supergraph H with ω(H) ≤ 3 and use greedy coloring along this perfect elimination order, yielding a 3-coloring of H and hence of G. Building H implicitly from the path decomposition makes the procedure linear after sorting. ∎\n\nLemma (Structure of N(x)∩N(y) for adjacent x,y).\nLet x,y be adjacent chords with s(x)<s(y)<t(x)<t(y) on the circle. Partition the circle into arcs A1=(s(x),s(y)), A2=(s(y),t(x)), A3=(t(x),t(y)), A4=(t(y),s(x)). Then every chord z ∈ N(x)∩N(y) has one endpoint in A1∪A3 and the other in A2∪A4, and in fact z lies in exactly one of the two groups G13 (endpoints in A1 and A3) or G24 (endpoints in A2 and A4). Moreover, every z ∈ G13 intersects every z′ ∈ G24. Consequently, G[N(x)∩N(y)] is independent iff at most one of G13,G24 is nonempty, and the nonempty group is inversion-free (no crossings) in its permutation orders.\nProof. The crossing conditions with x and y force endpoints to be on opposite sides of each of {s(x),t(x)} and {s(y),t(y)}, yielding exactly the two opposite-arc pairs G13 and G24. Fix z∈G13 with endpoints p∈A1 and q∈A3, and z′∈G24 with endpoints r∈A2 and s∈A4. In circular order we have p<r<q<s, so the endpoints alternate and z,z′ cross. Within a fixed group, adjacency is determined by inversions between the two induced orders (permutation graph); independence is equivalent to monotone agreement (no inversions). ∎\n\nProposition (Canonical-state reduction for 3-coloring DP on a bag).\nLet B be a bag of size t in the sweep/path decomposition. Two colorings c1,c2: B→{1,2,3} are equivalent if c2 = π∘c1 for some permutation π of {1,2,3}. The endpoint-DP for plain 3-coloring can be carried out on equivalence classes, using a canonical representative canon(c): scan B in fixed order (e.g., increasing right endpoint) and relabel the first-seen color as 1, the next unseen color as 2, etc.\n(i) Correctness: The DP recurrence depends only on color equality/inequality and thus is invariant under global color permutations; applying canon after each introduce/forget preserves the existence of extensions.\n(ii) State count: The number of equivalence classes equals the number of set partitions of B into at most 3 blocks: Q(t) = S2(t,1)+S2(t,2)+S2(t,3) = (1/6)·3^t + 1/2. Hence the DP runs in O(n·w·Q(w)) time and O(Q(w)) space, an asymptotic 6× reduction over 3^w. This reduction does not apply when color names carry semantics (lists/precolors). ∎"},"output_update":null}
