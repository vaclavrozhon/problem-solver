Complexity of 3-coloring circle graphs

Definitions.
• A graph is called a circle graph if it can be represented as an
intersection graph of chords in a circle. (That is, each vertex gets
assigned a chord in a circle, and two vertices are adjacent iff their
chords intersect.)
Question: What is the complexity of 3-coloring circle graphs?
Related results:
• For k-coloring of circle graphs with k ≥ 4, we know the problem
is NP-complete.
• For most superclasses of circle graphs, 3-coloring is known to be
NP-complete, usually because the superclasses also contain the class
planar graphs.
• Unger gave an algorithm for 3-coloring circle graphs in time
O(n log n) using a backtracking algorithm for a 3-SAT instance
with a specific structure based on the circle graph, however Bachmann, Rutter, and Stumpf have shown counterexamples to both
the reduction to 3-SAT and the backtracking algorithm.
