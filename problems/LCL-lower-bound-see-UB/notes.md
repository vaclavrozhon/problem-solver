Verifier notes (2025-08-27):
- Adopt a hybrid: use Prover 02’s gate to separate ON (i∈vars(j)) from OFF pairs, and Prover 01’s window-anchored blocks to keep all semantics within wb/wc.
- Replace any O(1)-time checker with a poly(s)-length, radius-1 tableau inside wc (and wb as needed) that verifies C(j) and exposes the needed bits to the gate; ensure error-chain refutations for malformed headers.
- Do not rely on boundary-only signatures for type multiplicity; instead, separate types by differential boundary-extendibility induced by interior content (witness success/failure under fixed S-labels).
- Action items: (i) write explicit boundary tables (offers, gate, PAD/CAP conduits), (ii) specify the clause-verification tableau and its alphabet, (iii) prove type-separation and OFF/ON correctness, (iv) complete a B=2 worked example with DP simulation.
