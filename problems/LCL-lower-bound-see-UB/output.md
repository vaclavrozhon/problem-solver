Lemma (Barrier-based invariance of repeats, i.e., F2 under unified barriers and offer gating).
Assume the following local rules for a radius-1 system with a seam node S flanked by a left block and a right block:
1) Outer-seam deactivation by barriers: If the left (resp. right) seam-adjacent interior node is a barrier BarVar (resp. BarCla), then at the corresponding outer seam S requires S1.truth=⊥, S1.phase=Neutral, offerL=0 (resp. S2.occ=⊥, S2.phase=Neutral, offerR=0).
2) Barrier edges forbid certificates: Along any edge incident to a barrier node, no certificate or terminal substate is permitted (i.e., none of EqStart/EqL[b]/EqR[b]/NeqStart/NeqPick[b]/NeqCheckL[b]/NeqCheckR[b]/CAP/PAD may appear).
3) Central seam start gating: Any non-neutral central-seam pair (Idle, EqStart, NeqStart, EqL/R[b], NeqCheckL/R[b], CAP, PAD) is allowed only if offerL=offerR=1 and S1.truth≠⊥, S2.occ≠⊥.
Then, for any word w and any z≥1 repeats of the interior blocks beyond the two blocks adjacent to S, the existence of a global labeling realizing a central terminal (CAP,CAP) or (PAD,PAD) depends only on the two nearest blocks. In particular, if a labeling exists for z=1, one exists for all z≥1; if none exists for z=1, none exists for any z≥1.
Proof.
Under (1)–(2), all certificate/cursor activity is confined to the two nearest blocks: barriers force the outer seam offers to 0 if present and forbid any certificate token to cross a barrier edge. Under (3), the central seam can leave Neutral only if both nearest blocks are active (offerL=offerR=1) and S choices are non-⊥. Hence any successful terminal at S must be witnessed entirely within the two nearest blocks, independent of farther repeats. If there is a labeling for z=1, extend it to any z≥1 by repeating the inert barrier-protected interiors; all local constraints remain satisfied and the central seam labeling is unchanged. Conversely, if no labeling exists for z=1, then adding repetitions only introduces more barrier-protected interiors that cannot create offers or cursors at S; thus the central seam remains unable to realize a terminal for any z≥1. ∎

Lemma (No-⊥ at S on active seams).
Assume the outer seam rules: if RoleL=AccVar then S1.truth∈{VT,VF} and offerL=1; otherwise S1.truth=⊥ and S1.phase=Neutral and offerL=0; symmetrically for the right side. Then whenever the left (resp. right) neighbor is active (RoleL=AccVar, resp. RoleR=AccCla), the S choice on that side cannot be ⊥, and any central-seam non-neutral pair that requires offerL=offerR=1 necessarily occurs with non-⊥ choices on both sides. In particular, activation preserves (F1) nontriviality by forbidding ⊥ at S on active contexts.
Proof.
Immediate from the outer-seam constraints: when Role•=Acc•, the only allowed outer-seam pairings force S•.choice∈{VT,VF} (resp. {O1,O2,O3}) and offer•=1; the cases with S•.choice=⊥ or offer•=0 are disallowed. Since the central seam non-neutral pairs require offerL=offerR=1, they can only occur when both choices are non-⊥. ∎
