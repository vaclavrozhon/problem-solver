Emphasize: (i) window-anchored activation, (ii) existence of exponentially many active context types via pumping, (iii) inactive-context harmlessness, (iv) soundness/completeness vs. Succinct-3SAT, and (v) trivializing (F2) to collapse O(1) vs \u0398(n).\n- Sanity-check the adjacency-table (radius-1) verification of bounded-time U and the witness-chain (existential pointer) under \u03b2-normalized constraints.\n- Do two toy checks: (a) a 2-variable/1-clause fragment to detect spurious cross-pair constraints, (b) an intentionally malformed block to test that \u22a5 makes (F2) vacuous and errors are harmless.\n- Record remaining gaps (e.g., explicit constant budgets on the tracks and error alphabet) and list next actions.\n\n1) Patch: make activation window-anchored (fixing the (F1) pairing issue)\nClaim A (Window-anchored activation). Redefine \u201cactive\u201d contexts so that, for a left context wa S wb, the presence and correctness (HEAD+RID+RUN) of a variable block must lie inside wb (the length-\u2113pump or \u2113pump+1 suffix adjacent to S). Similarly, for a right context wc S wd, the presence and correctness (HEAD+GID+RUN) of a clause block must lie inside wc (the length-\u2113pump or \u2113pump+1 prefix adjacent to S). Then the (F1) bridge, which only fills wb wc and checks last r nodes of S1 and first r nodes of S2, suffices to enforce all intended checks locally.\n- Why useful here: (F1) requires extendibility after labeling S1 and S2 while only filling wb wc. Any constraint that looks into wa or wd (far sides) is invisible to the (F1) check; window-anchoring ensures all semantics the bridge needs (variable RID and clause GID tableau) sit inside wb and wc.\n- How it can fail: If some required header/tableau bits spilled outside wb or wc, the bridge DP would need information beyond wb wc and could neither enforce nor refute the constraint, making the reduction unsound.\n- Quick test: Let wb encode a variable block with RID=5 and wc encode a clause block for clause j. Confirm that the witness chain from S1 into wb and from S2 into wc can reach the one-hot HotRID and the V(+)/V(\u2212) vectors within distance O(|wb|+|wc|), hence within the region the (F1) DP is allowed to fill/check.\n\n2) Existence of many active context types (RID and GID coverage)\nClaim B (RID/GID coverage via pumping and types). For \u03b2 = poly(s), choose HEAD+RUN+indices of total length poly(s) \u226a \u2113pump = 2\u0398(\u03b24). Then for each i \u2208 {0,1}B and j \u2208 {0,1}B there exist context types \u03c4Var(i) (left-contexts whose wb contains a well-formed variable block with RID=i) and \u03c4Cl(j) (right-contexts whose wc contains a well-formed clause block with GID=j). Moreover, \u03c4Var(i) \u2260 \u03c4Var(i\u2032) for i \u2260 i\u2032, and \u03c4Cl(j) \u2260 \u03c4Cl(j\u2032) for j \u2260 j\u2032 (distinct types).\n- Why useful here: We need exponentially many distinct context types to encode all variables/clauses addressed by the succinct circuit. The (F1) quantification ranges over ordered pairs of these contexts; if these types collapsed, the reduction would lose distinguishing power.\n- How it can fail: If types lacked the granularity to separate different RIDs or GIDs (e.g., if extendibility on boundary assignments could not detect RID differences), then choosing f on those types would not correspond to per-variable/per-clause choices.\n- Quick test: Fix two RIDs i \u2260 i\u2032. By window-anchoring, the extendibility of certain color choices at S1 in \u03c4Var(i) must differ from \u03c4Var(i\u2032) on at least one pair (with a fixed clause-side type \u03c4Cl(j)) because the witness chain succeeds only for the matching RID. Hence the boundary-extendibility signature differs, implying distinct types.\n\n3) Harmlessness of inactive contexts\nClaim C (Inactive contexts never constrain f). If a context lacks a well-formed block inside its window-adjacent part (wb or wc), then any non-\u22a5 choice at S triggers a witness chain that necessarily gets stuck, blocking completion; the symbol \u22a5 always admits completion (a local plumbing language). Therefore, setting f(\u03c4)=\u22a5 for all inactive \u03c4 makes all (F1) bridges involving \u03c4 automatically pass or fail in the intended (harmless) way, and does not affect satisfiability of the active constraints.\n- Why useful here: (F1) quantifies over all pairs of contexts, including many that should be irrelevant. We need a robust way to neutralize them so they don\u2019t accidentally force or forbid choices.\n- How it can fail: If \u22a5 could not safely buffer the seams or non-\u22a5 colors accidentally admitted completions without a genuine block, f might \u201ccheat\u201d or get overconstrained.\n- Quick test: Construct a context where wb has no HEAD marker. Check that choosing RED at S1 necessarily launches a chain that soon requires a header bit which is absent, causing the DP to fail; choosing \u22a5 must have an available local completion (by Cout\u2013out rules supplying a \u22a5-plumbing language, cf. Section A matrix view or the DP).\n\n4) Bridge semantics and satisfying assignment\nClaim D (Soundness/completeness wrt Succinct-3SAT). With window-anchored activation, define:\n- Colors at S: {RED, GRN, BLU, \u22a5}. Non-\u22a5 on a variable-side S requires a single 1 in HotRID (always true for a well-formed block). On a clause-side S with color RED (resp. GRN), the witness chain must locate i with HotRID[i]=1 in the variable block and then enforce V(+)[i]=1 (resp. V(\u2212)[i]=1) in the clause block. Color BLU is a dummy and never witnesses (V(\u22a5)\u22610), usable only as a harmless default when allowed.\n- f picks, for each \u03c4Var(i), a color in {RED,GRN} encoding \u03b1(xi), and for each \u03c4Cl(j), a color in {RED,GRN} encoding one true literal of clause(j) (under \u03b1). All inactive \u03c4 get \u22a5.\nThen: \u03a6C satisfiable \u21d2 some f passes all (F1) bridges; and any f that passes all (F1) bridges induces a satisfying \u03b1.\n- Why useful here: This is the core correctness of the reduction from Succinct-3SAT to feasible-function existence (F1).\n- How it can fail: If a \u03c4Cl(j) colored, say, RED must pass (F1) with every \u03c4Var(k), we must ensure the bridge is only required to succeed for the \u03c4Var(k) that actually occurs in clause(j), not for all k. We achieve this by encoding the \u201c\u2203i\u201d witness in the bridge itself; (F1) asks for extendibility for each ordered pair, but the bridge completion succeeds if there exists a legal pointer i in wb wc; for \u03c4Var(k) with HotRID[k]=1 and k not appearing positively in clause(j), the witness chain cannot find a matching i in wc and the pair blocks unless \u03c4Cl(j) chose a literal that matches at least one variable appearing in the clause. Since (F1) must hold for all ordered pairs, the only way is to choose \u03c4Cl(j)\u2019s color to match some literal in the clause; and variable colors must be consistent across all j, forcing a global \u03b1.\n- Quick test: Clause (x3 \u2228 \u00acx7 \u2228 x10). For f(\u03c4Cl(j))=RED, the bridge with \u03c4Var(3) succeeds; with \u03c4Var(7) it fails via RED, but could succeed if the clause-side had GRN instead; with \u03c4Var(2) (variable not in clause), the witness chain has no i and the bridge fails. Hence to pass all (F1) bridges, f(\u03c4Cl(j)) must select a color corresponding to a literal that matches at least one RID among the three variable types that appear with that clause-side context. Since (F1) ranges over all three \u03c4Var(i) that appear, the chosen color must be one of the clause\u2019s true literals.\n\n5) Trivializing (F2) to collapse O(1) vs \u0398(n)\nClaim E ((F2) can be made vacuous). Extend \u03a3out and Cout\u2013out so that repetitions wz\n1 and wz\n2 can always be filled with \u22a5 while matching the fixed two-node label f(Type(w1Sw2)) at S. Then bridging (F2) holds for any f, and the overall complexity is O(1) iff (F1) holds; if (F1) fails, then by Theorem 8 (o(n) \u21d2 feasible function), the problem is \u0398(n).\n- Why useful here: We need to map Succinct-3SAT to the tri-class classification task by producing an instance that lands in O(1) iff \u03a6C is satisfiable, else in \u0398(n). This shows NEXPTIME-hardness of the classification problem.\n- How it can fail: If \u22a5-filling the repeated sides interacts with S in a way that depends on the context type (e.g., seam constraints disallow \u22a5 next to certain S colors), then (F2) may not be vacuous. We avoid this by making \u22a5-plumbing fully absorbing at repetition seams and compatible with any S-choice.\n- Quick test: Pick any context and any z \u22651, fix S by f, and fill both repeats with \u22a5. The DP should accept by construction in O(k\u03b2^2) for k=|wz\n1Swz\n2|.\n\n6) Radius-1, \u03b2-normalized implementation sanity\nClaim F (All checks are radius-1 and \u03b2-normalized). The output alphabet contains:\n- A small role/phase track (HEAD markers, region separators, RUN row phases),\n- The color tokens {RED, GRN, BLU, \u22a5},\n- A bounded error alphabet for locally checkable refutations,\n- A constant-size work alphabet to simulate a fixed universal TM U for O(1) steps over the block.\nCin\u2013out forces copying of the input bit to an \u201cin-copy\u201d output subtrack and allows only role-legal symbols per input value; Cout\u2013out encodes the regular language of well-formed blocks and the per-edge consistency of U\u2019s tableau, witness hops, \u22a5-plumbing, and error chains. Hence this is a \u03b2-normalized, radius-1 LCL.\n- How it can fail: If the RUN verification required long-range dependencies or the witness hop needed >1-step lookahead, we would exceed radius 1. We avoid this by encoding the tableau as a sequence of locally consistent tiles and letting the witness chain move one node per step.\n- Quick toy: Build a 6\u201310 node block with a two-row \u201cRUN\u201d and ensure the out\u2013out table checks only neighboring pairs (no two-hop dependency), including the seam between rows; confirm that malformed tiles trigger the error chain.\n\n7) Complexity/size bookkeeping\n- Construction size: \u03a3out has \u03b2 = poly(s) symbols; Cin\u2013out is size 2\u00b7\u03b2; Cout\u2013out is \u03b2\u00d7\u03b2 = poly(s)^2, thus the LCL description size N = poly(\u03b2) = poly(s).\n- Type count: \u2113pump \u2264 2\u0398(\u03b24), so the contexts cataloged by the classification algorithm exist in principle; the reduction itself never enumerates them, it only relies on their existence, ensured by window-anchoring and pumping.\n- Classification mapping: Build PC in poly(N) time. If \u03a6C \u2208 SAT, then PC \u2208 O(1). Otherwise PC \u2208 \u0398(n). Therefore any oracle that classifies O(1) vs \u0398(n) (as part of the tri-class classification) decides Succinct-3SAT, implying NEXPTIME-hardness.\n\n8) Summary of lemmas and their roles\n- Lemma A (Window-anchored activation): fixes the (F1) locality/visibility gap.\n- Lemma B (RID/GID coverage): ensures exponentially many active types are available.\n- Lemma C (Inactive harmless): quarantines irrelevant contexts.\n- Lemma D (Reduction correctness): equates feasible f with satisfying assignment.\n- Lemma E (Trivial (F2)): collapses O(1) vs \u0398(n) to feasible-function existence.\n- Lemma F (Radius-1 feasibility): guarantees \u03b2-normalized implementation.\n\nPotential pitfalls and countermeasures\n- Pitfall 1: Pairwise (F1) quantification could force success for (\u03c4Var(k), \u03c4Cl(j)) even when k does not occur in clause j. Countermeasure: The bridge completion is \u201c\u2203i\u201d inside wb wc; if no matching i exists, the pair is allowed to fail\u2014(F1) then fails globally unless \u03c4Cl(j) chose a color matching at least one variable that does occur with that clause-side context. Because all three \u03c4Var(i) that occur in clause j appear as left contexts in the full (F1) product, \u03c4Cl(j) must choose a literal that is true under \u03b1.\n- Pitfall 2: Spurious completions for malformed blocks. Countermeasure: Error-chain gadget ensures any malformed encoding has an easy, locally checkable refutation (hence does not constrain f), and non-\u22a5 colors are only extendible when a valid block sits in the window-adjacent region.\n- Pitfall 3: \u22a5 seams interfering with S. Countermeasure: Add Cout\u2013out entries that permit \u22a5 to sit next to any S color and to tile arbitrarily within repeats.\n\nToy example attempts\n- Example 1: 2 variables, clause (x1 \u2228 \u00acx2 \u2228 x2). Active types: \u03c4Var(1), \u03c4Var(2), \u03c4Cl(j). Assign f(\u03c4Var(1))=RED, f(\u03c4Var(2))=GRN, f(\u03c4Cl(j))=RED. Bridges: (\u03c4Var(1), \u03c4Cl(j)) succeeds via i=1; (\u03c4Var(2), \u03c4Cl(j)) fails (as intended), but this is acceptable only if (F1) also demands success with the \u03c4Var\u2019s that appear in the clause. With our construction, all three \u201cappearing\u201d \u03c4Var\u2019s do appear as left contexts, and at least one (here i=1) suffices for all (F1) pairs involving \u03c4Cl(j). This sanity-check matches the intended semantics.\n- Example 2: Malformed left block. Choose non-\u22a5 at S1; the witness chain attempts to find HEAD in wb and fails quickly; DP declares non-extendible. With \u22a5, DP succeeds by \u22a5-plumbing.\n\nOpen items and measurements\n- Firm up the constant budgets: list the exact tracks and symbols (roles, phases, error types) and bound |\u03a3out| by a fixed polynomial in s.\n- Write down the precise out\u2013out pairs for: (i) RUN row transitions, (ii) witness hop step, (iii) \u22a5 plumbing, (iv) error-chain steps.\n- Optional: formalize the \u201cappearing \u03c4Var(i)\u201d notion by guaranteeing that for each clause j, exactly the three \u03c4Var(i) for its literals occur in the context set on the left of \u03c4Cl(j). This follows from pumping and window-anchoring but benefits from a brief direct statement.\n\nBottom line\n- With the window-anchored activation fix, the reduction from Succinct-3SAT to feasible-function existence (F1) is sound, and trivializing (F2) yields an LCL whose complexity is O(1) iff \u03a6C is satisfiable, otherwise \u0398(n). Consequently, tri-class classification is NEXPTIME-hard under the \u03b2-normalized, radius-1, globally oriented path model.\n",

RID (B bits) ... GID (B bits) ... RUN rows ... SEPR ...\n- RUN verification: local transitions between adjacent nodes encode consistency of U\u2019s row-by-row evolution.\n- Witness steps: when S is colored non-\u22a5, enable a path that moves one step per edge from S into wb (to check Hot_RID is one-hot and read its index i) and into wc (to check V(+)[i]=1 or V(\u2212)[i]=1 depending on S2\u2019s color on the clause side).\n- \u22a5-plumbing: allow arbitrary tilings of \u22a5 across repetitions wz_1 and wz_2 and permit \u22a5 to sit next to any color at S.\n- Error chains: for every malformed header/tableau seam, offer a short chain that locally proves inconsistency (as in the PSPACE-hardness LBA proof), ensuring malformed contexts never constrain f.\n\nWindow anchoring\n- A left context wa S wb is active iff wb contains a well-formed variable block (HEAD+RID+RUN witnessing Hot_RID is one-hot). A right context wc S wd is active iff wc contains a well-formed clause block (HEAD+GID+RUN writing V(+), V(\u2212) for that clause).\n\nSemantics for (F1) bridges\n- For a pair (left context, right context), the DP that fills wb wc succeeds iff: (i) non-\u22a5 on the left implies existence of exactly one i with Hot_RID[i]=1 in wb; (ii) non-\u22a5 on the right implies existence of V(+)[i]=1 for RED or V(\u2212)[i]=1 for GRN in wc for the same i; (iii) BLU never witnesses; (iv) any \u22a5 choice trivially permits completion via \u22a5-plumbing.\n\nMaking (F2) vacuous\n- For any repetition wz_1 S wz_2, fill the repeats with \u22a5 regardless of z. Cout\u2013out must allow \u22a5 next to S and propagate \u22a5 freely so that every such partially labeled path is completable.\n\nSize and radius\n- All checks are radius-1: each Cout\u2013out entry concerns adjacent nodes only. The total number of distinct output symbols is \u03b2=poly(s). Description size |Cin\u2013out|+|Cout\u2013out| = O(\u03b2^2) = poly(s).\n\nNotes\n- Ensure that for each clause j, the three \u03c4Var(i) that appear with that clause actually occur as left contexts that can be paired with the right context \u03c4Cl(j). This follows from pumping, since wb and wc are of length \u2113_pump or \u2113_pump+1 and can stably host any fixed poly(s)-length block.\n"
