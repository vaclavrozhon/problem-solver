  "summary_md": "In this round, the prover outlined a mini-plan focusing on extracting key lemmas related to PSPACE-hardness and NEXPTIME algorithms, analyzing automaton properties, exploring reductions from known NEXPTIME-hard problems, investigating the impact of output alphabet size on complexity, and reviewing an NEXPTIME algorithm sketch. However, the verifier noted that the mini-plan was repetitive and lacked new insights, emphasizing the need for concrete applications of key lemmas, explicit examples for automaton properties, rigorous construction of reductions, and detailed analysis of the output alphabet size implications. The overall verdict was 'unlikely' due to these shortcomings.",
