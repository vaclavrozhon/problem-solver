The last round (prover-04) gives a concrete reduction P_C: radius-1 gadgets (HEAD · RID · GID · RUN) plus an existential witness-chain that, when S is colored, nondeterministically selects an index i and locally verifies Hot_RID[i] and the clause bit V^{(±)}[i] via a row-by-row U-simulation. Key bounds: |Types| ≤ ℓ_pump = 2^{Θ(β^4)}, finite Z ≤ ℓ_pump^2 for (F2), and extension-check DP in O(k β^2). Neutralizing (F2) with a ⊥-filler transfers F1-hardness to the three-way classification.
