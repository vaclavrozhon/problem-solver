Goal: show NEXPTIME-hardness of the 3-way LOCAL classification for β-normalized, r=1 LCLs on oriented paths by reducing Succinct-3SAT to Feasible-Function Existence (F1). The last round (prover-04) gives a concrete reduction P_C: radius-1 gadgets (HEAD · RID · GID · RUN) plus an existential witness-chain that, when S is colored, nondeterministically selects an index i and locally verifies Hot_RID[i] and the clause bit V^{(±)}[i] via a row-by-row U-simulation. Key bounds: |Types| ≤ ℓ_pump = 2^{Θ(β^4)}, finite Z ≤ ℓ_pump^2 for (F2), and extension-check DP in O(k β^2). Neutralizing (F2) with a ⊥-filler transfers F1-hardness to the three-way classification. Correctness (completeness/soundness) sketched; remaining formal work: explicit radius-1 adjacency tables, witness-chain formalization, and a separability lemma proving distinct RID/GID yield distinct context types. Verifier verdict: partial success.
