In this round, the prover outlined a structured mini-plan to tackle the complexities of LCLs and their hardness classifications. Key areas of focus include a thorough understanding of the PSPACE-hardness proof, careful analysis of a proposed NEXPTIME algorithm, and the exploration of reductions from known NEXPTIME-hard problems. The prover emphasized the importance of systematic exploration of LCL cases and the formulation of lemmas regarding the relationship between local complexity and the size of $\beta$. However, the verifier noted that while the plan is well-structured, it requires deeper analysis and caution against misinterpretations and generalizations. The overall verdict remains uncertain, indicating that further refinement and validation are necessary.
