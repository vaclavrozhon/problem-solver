  "summary_md": "Round snapshot: two prover sketches plus verifier feedback. Prover-01 proposed a window-anchored activation fix (place RID/GID and HEAD/RUN inside wb/wc) and pumping-based existence of many active types; it also argued inactive contexts can be neutralized with ⊥ and that (F2) can be trivialized by ⊥-plumbing. Prover-02 introduced a gated-bridge gadget that turns ON only for intended (VAR_i, CLA_j) ordered pairs (forcing CAP propagation when i ∈ vars(j)), plus two finite-check lemmas (finite-z periodicity for (F2) and a layered radius-1 DP for extendibility in O(k·β^2)). The verifier endorsed combining gating with window-anchoring but flagged two untenable claims (deriving 2^B types from only 2 boundary nodes; O(1) local clause-triple validation) and requested explicit C_in–out/C_out–out tables for the four boundary nodes and conduits, a formal type-separation lemma, and a poly(s)-length clause-decoder tableau. Verdict: uncertain. Citations: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json, Verifier (summary_md).",
  "highlights": [
    "Window-anchored activation (Prover-01) fixes (F1) locality: variable RID and clause GID live inside wb/wc so the (F1) bridge only needs local checks.",
    "Gated-bridge gadget (Prover-02) controls activation: ON iff OFFVAR(i) and OFFCLA(j) offers match i ∈ vars(j); ON forces CAP-wire propagation that enforces literal satisfaction, OFF permits neutral PAD fills.",
    "Finite-check lemmas: (A) finite-z bound for (F2) periodicity; (B) layered radius-1 DP for extendibility (time O(k·β^2), space O(k·β)) — supports NEXPTIME membership.",
    "Plan to get exponentially many types: pumping + input-driven micro-alphabets that place RID/GID signatures near S. Verifier: deriving 2^B types from only 2 boundary nodes as claimed is not acceptable without a formal type-separation proof (may require interior tableaus).",
    "(F2) trivialization via ⊥-plumbing is plausible: make repeats fillable by ⊥ regardless of z so classification reduces to (F1); must ensure ⊥ seams are fully absorbing and S-independent.",
    "Remaining gap checklist from verifier: explicit C_in–out/C_out–out tables for the 4-node boundary and conduit tiles, a formal type-separation lemma, and a poly(s)-length radius-1 clause-decoder; overall status: uncertain."

    "Produce explicit C_in–out and C_out–out adjacency tables for the four boundary nodes around S and for the wb/wc conduits (specify allowed offers, CAP/PAD tokens, error-chain lanes) and prove the local rules: non-⊥⇒offer and the ON/OFF gating invariants.",
    "Formalize and prove a type-separation lemma: construct ≥2^B distinct variable and clause context types (using pumping plus boundary+interior signatures); include a concrete B=2 toy DP simulation to validate separation.",
    "Design and write the poly(s)-length, radius-1 clause-decoder tableau placed inside wb/wc that locally verifies the three indices of clause j (with an error-chain refuter), then finalize the (F1)⇔SAT(C) and (F2)-trivialization correctness proofs."
