The prover's latest round outlines a structured approach to proving NEXPTIME-hardness for the specified problem. However, there are several areas that require more rigor and clarity. Firstly, the understanding of the PSPACE-hardness proof is crucial, yet the prover must ensure they are not misinterpreting the automaton simulation, which could lead to flawed conclusions about the complexity. The analysis of the NEXPTIME algorithm in the second draft is also essential, but the prover should be cautious about generalizing its applicability. The potential reductions from known NEXPTIME-hard problems need careful consideration; if the reductions do not align with the LCL structure, they may not yield the desired results. Furthermore, the exploration of specific LCL cases should be more systematic to ensure that the chosen examples genuinely reflect the complexities in question. Lastly, the formulation of lemmas regarding the relationship between $eta$ and local complexity must be substantiated with rigorous testing against edge cases. Overall, while the plan is comprehensive, it lacks depth in certain areas that could lead to unjustified claims or gaps in the argumentation.
