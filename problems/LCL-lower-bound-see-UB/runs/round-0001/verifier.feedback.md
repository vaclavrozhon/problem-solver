The prover's latest round shows a clear understanding of the task at hand, but it lacks concrete steps towards achieving NEXPTIME-hardness. The mini-plan is essentially a repetition of the previous round without any new insights or progress. The prover needs to extract specific lemmas from the attached papers and apply them to the local complexity problem, rather than just reviewing definitions. Additionally, the exploration of automaton properties and reductions from known NEXPTIME-hard problems must be more rigorous. For instance, the prover should provide explicit examples or constructions that demonstrate how these properties lead to NEXPTIME-hardness. The investigation into the output alphabet size's implications is also vague and requires more detailed analysis. Overall, while the plan is structured, it lacks depth and actionable steps that would lead to genuine progress in proving NEXPTIME-hardness.
