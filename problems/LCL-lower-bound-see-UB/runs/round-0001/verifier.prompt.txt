Emphasize: (i) window-anchored activation, (ii) existence of exponentially many active context types via pumping, (iii) inactive-context harmlessness, (iv) soundness/completeness vs. Succinct-3SAT, and (v) trivializing (F2) to collapse O(1) vs \u0398(n).\n- Sanity-check the adjacency-table (radius-1) verification of bounded-time U and the witness-chain (existential pointer) under \u03b2-normalized constraints.\n- Do two toy checks: (a) a 2-variable/1-clause fragment to detect spurious cross-pair constraints, (b) an intentionally malformed block to test that \u22a5 makes (F2) vacuous and errors are harmless.\n- Record remaining gaps (e.g., explicit constant budgets on the tracks and error alphabet) and list next actions.\n\n1) Patch: make activation window-anchored (fixing the (F1) pairing issue)\nClaim A (Window-anchored activation). Redefine \u201cactive\u201d contexts so that, for a left context wa S wb, the presence and correctness (HEAD+RID+RUN) of a variable block must lie inside wb (the length-\u2113pump or \u2113pump+1 suffix adjacent to S). Similarly, for a right context wc S wd, the presence and correctness (HEAD+GID+RUN) of a clause block must lie inside wc (the length-\u2113pump or \u2113pump+1 prefix adjacent to S). Then the (F1) bridge, which only fills wb wc and checks last r nodes of S1 and first r nodes of S2, suffices to enforce all intended checks locally.\n- Why useful here: (F1) requires extendibility after labeling S1 and S2 while only filling wb wc. Any constraint that looks into wa or wd (far sides) is invisible to the (F1) check; window-anchoring ensures all semantics the bridge needs (variable RID and clause GID tableau) sit inside wb and wc.\n- How it can fail: If some required header/tableau bits spilled outside wb or wc, the bridge DP would need information beyond wb wc and could neither enforce nor refute the constraint, making the reduction unsound.\n- Quick test: Let wb encode a variable block with RID=5 and wc encode a clause block for clause j. Confirm that the witness chain from S1 into wb and from S2 into wc can reach the one-hot HotRID and the V(+)/V(\u2212) vectors within distance O(|wb|+|wc|), hence within the region the (F1) DP is allowed to fill/check.\n\n2) Existence of many active context types (RID and GID coverage)\nClaim B (RID/GID coverage via pumping and types). For \u03b2 = poly(s), choose HEAD+RUN+indices of total length poly(s) \u226a \u2113pump = 2\u0398(\u03b24). Then for each i \u2208 {0,1}B and j \u2208 {0,1}B there exist context types \u03c4Var(i) (left-contexts whose wb contains a well-formed variable block with RID=i) and \u03c4Cl(j) (right-contexts whose wc contains a well-formed clause block with GID=j). Moreover, \u03c4Var(i) \u2260 \u03c4Var(i\u2032) for i \u2260 i\u2032, and \u03c4Cl(j) \u2260 \u03c4Cl(j\u2032) for j \u2260 j\u2032 (distinct types).\n- Why useful here: We need exponentially many distinct context types to encode all variables/clauses addressed by the succinct circuit. The (F1) quantification ranges over ordered pairs of these contexts; if these types collapsed, the reduction would lose distinguishing power.\n- How it can fail: If types lacked the granularity to separate different RIDs or GIDs (e.g., if extendibility on boundary assignments could not detect RID differences), then choosing f on those types would not correspond to per-variable/per-clause choices.\n- Quick test: Fix two RIDs i \u2260 i\u2032. By window-anchoring, the extendibility of certain color choices at S1 in \u03c4Var(i) must differ from \u03c4Var(i\u2032) on at least one pair (with a fixed clause-side type \u03c4Cl(j)) because the witness chain succeeds only for the matching RID. Hence the boundary-extendibility signature differs, implying distinct types.\n\n3) Harmlessness of inactive contexts\nClaim C (Inactive contexts never constrain f). If a context lacks a well-formed block inside its window-adjacent part (wb or wc), then any non-\u22a5 choice at S triggers a witness chain that necessarily gets stuck, blocking completion; the symbol \u22a5 always admits completion (a local plumbing language). Therefore, setting f(\u03c4)=\u22a5 for all inactive \u03c4 makes all (F1) bridges involving \u03c4 automatically pass or fail in the intended (harmless) way, and does not affect satisfiability of the active constraints.\n- Why useful here: (F1) quantifies over all pairs of contexts, including many that should be irrelevant. We need a robust way to neutralize them so they don\u2019t accidentally force or forbid choices.\n- How it can fail: If \u22a5 could not safely buffer the seams or non-\u22a5 colors accidentally admitted completions without a genuine block, f might \u201ccheat\u201d or get overconstrained.\n- Quick test: Construct a context where wb has no HEAD marker. Check that choosing RED at S1 necessarily launches a chain that soon requires a header bit which is absent, causing the DP to fail; choosing \u22a5 must have an available local completion (by Cout\u2013out rules supplying a \u22a5-plumbing language, cf. Section A matrix view or the DP).\n\n4) Bridge semantics and satisfying assignment\nClaim D (Soundness/completeness wrt Succinct-3SAT). With window-anchored activation, define:\n- Colors at S: {RED, GRN, BLU, \u22a5}. Non-\u22a5 on a variable-side S requires a single 1 in HotRID (always true for a well-formed block). On a clause-side S with color RED (resp. GRN), the witness chain must locate i with HotRID[i]=1 in the variable block and then enforce V(+)[i]=1 (resp. V(\u2212)[i]=1) in the clause block. Color BLU is a dummy and never witnesses (V(\u22a5)\u22610), usable only as a harmless default when allowed.\n- f picks, for each \u03c4Var(i), a color in {RED,GRN} encoding \u03b1(xi), and for each \u03c4Cl(j), a color in {RED,GRN} encoding one true literal of clause(j) (under \u03b1). All inactive \u03c4 get \u22a5.\nThen: \u03a6C satisfiable \u21d2 some f passes all (F1) bridges; and any f that passes all (F1) bridges induces a satisfying \u03b1.\n- Why useful here: This is the core correctness of the reduction from Succinct-3SAT to feasible-function existence (F1).\n- How it can fail: If a \u03c4Cl(j) colored, say, RED must pass (F1) with every \u03c4Var(k), we must ensure the bridge is only required to succeed for the \u03c4Var(k) that actually occurs in clause(j), not for all k. We achieve this by encoding the \u201c\u2203i\u201d witness in the bridge itself; (F1) asks for extendibility for each ordered pair, but the bridge completion succeeds if there exists a legal pointer i in wb wc; for \u03c4Var(k) with HotRID[k]=1 and k not appearing positively in clause(j), the witness chain cannot find a matching i in wc and the pair blocks unless \u03c4Cl(j) chose a literal that matches at least one variable appearing in the clause. Since (F1) must hold for all ordered pairs, the only way is to choose \u03c4Cl(j)\u2019s color to match some literal in the clause; and variable colors must be consistent across all j, forcing a global \u03b1.\n- Quick test: Clause (x3 \u2228 \u00acx7 \u2228 x10). For f(\u03c4Cl(j))=RED, the bridge with \u03c4Var(3) succeeds; with \u03c4Var(7) it fails via RED, but could succeed if the clause-side had GRN instead; with \u03c4Var(2) (variable not in clause), the witness chain has no i and the bridge fails. Hence to pass all (F1) bridges, f(\u03c4Cl(j)) must select a color corresponding to a literal that matches at least one RID among the three variable types that appear with that clause-side context. Since (F1) ranges over all three \u03c4Var(i) that appear, the chosen color must be one of the clause\u2019s true literals.\n\n5) Trivializing (F2) to collapse O(1) vs \u0398(n)\nClaim E ((F2) can be made vacuous). Extend \u03a3out and Cout\u2013out so that repetitions wz\n1 and wz\n2 can always be filled with \u22a5 while matching the fixed two-node label f(Type(w1Sw2)) at S. Then bridging (F2) holds for any f, and the overall complexity is O(1) iff (F1) holds; if (F1) fails, then by Theorem 8 (o(n) \u21d2 feasible function), the problem is \u0398(n).\n- Why useful here: We need to map Succinct-3SAT to the tri-class classification task by producing an instance that lands in O(1) iff \u03a6C is satisfiable, else in \u0398(n). This shows NEXPTIME-hardness of the classification problem.\n- How it can fail: If \u22a5-filling the repeated sides interacts with S in a way that depends on the context type (e.g., seam constraints disallow \u22a5 next to certain S colors), then (F2) may not be vacuous. We avoid this by making \u22a5-plumbing fully absorbing at repetition seams and compatible with any S-choice.\n- Quick test: Pick any context and any z \u22651, fix S by f, and fill both repeats with \u22a5. The DP should accept by construction in O(k\u03b2^2) for k=|wz\n1Swz\n2|.\n\n6) Radius-1, \u03b2-normalized implementation sanity\nClaim F (All checks are radius-1 and \u03b2-normalized). The output alphabet contains:\n- A small role/phase track (HEAD markers, region separators, RUN row phases),\n- The color tokens {RED, GRN, BLU, \u22a5},\n- A bounded error alphabet for locally checkable refutations,\n- A constant-size work alphabet to simulate a fixed universal TM U for O(1) steps over the block.\nCin\u2013out forces copying of the input bit to an \u201cin-copy\u201d output subtrack and allows only role-legal symbols per input value; Cout\u2013out encodes the regular language of well-formed blocks and the per-edge consistency of U\u2019s tableau, witness hops, \u22a5-plumbing, and error chains. Hence this is a \u03b2-normalized, radius-1 LCL.\n- How it can fail: If the RUN verification required long-range dependencies or the witness hop needed >1-step lookahead, we would exceed radius 1. We avoid this by encoding the tableau as a sequence of locally consistent tiles and letting the witness chain move one node per step.\n- Quick toy: Build a 6\u201310 node block with a two-row \u201cRUN\u201d and ensure the out\u2013out table checks only neighboring pairs (no two-hop dependency), including the seam between rows; confirm that malformed tiles trigger the error chain.\n\n7) Complexity/size bookkeeping\n- Construction size: \u03a3out has \u03b2 = poly(s) symbols; Cin\u2013out is size 2\u00b7\u03b2; Cout\u2013out is \u03b2\u00d7\u03b2 = poly(s)^2, thus the LCL description size N = poly(\u03b2) = poly(s).\n- Type count: \u2113pump \u2264 2\u0398(\u03b24), so the contexts cataloged by the classification algorithm exist in principle; the reduction itself never enumerates them, it only relies on their existence, ensured by window-anchoring and pumping.\n- Classification mapping: Build PC in poly(N) time. If \u03a6C \u2208 SAT, then PC \u2208 O(1). Otherwise PC \u2208 \u0398(n). Therefore any oracle that classifies O(1) vs \u0398(n) (as part of the tri-class classification) decides Succinct-3SAT, implying NEXPTIME-hardness.\n\n8) Summary of lemmas and their roles\n- Lemma A (Window-anchored activation): fixes the (F1) locality/visibility gap.\n- Lemma B (RID/GID coverage): ensures exponentially many active types are available.\n- Lemma C (Inactive harmless): quarantines irrelevant contexts.\n- Lemma D (Reduction correctness): equates feasible f with satisfying assignment.\n- Lemma E (Trivial (F2)): collapses O(1) vs \u0398(n) to feasible-function existence.\n- Lemma F (Radius-1 feasibility): guarantees \u03b2-normalized implementation.\n\nPotential pitfalls and countermeasures\n- Pitfall 1: Pairwise (F1) quantification could force success for (\u03c4Var(k), \u03c4Cl(j)) even when k does not occur in clause j. Countermeasure: The bridge completion is \u201c\u2203i\u201d inside wb wc; if no matching i exists, the pair is allowed to fail\u2014(F1) then fails globally unless \u03c4Cl(j) chose a color matching at least one variable that does occur with that clause-side context. Because all three \u03c4Var(i) that occur in clause j appear as left contexts in the full (F1) product, \u03c4Cl(j) must choose a literal that is true under \u03b1.\n- Pitfall 2: Spurious completions for malformed blocks. Countermeasure: Error-chain gadget ensures any malformed encoding has an easy, locally checkable refutation (hence does not constrain f), and non-\u22a5 colors are only extendible when a valid block sits in the window-adjacent region.\n- Pitfall 3: \u22a5 seams interfering with S. Countermeasure: Add Cout\u2013out entries that permit \u22a5 to sit next to any S color and to tile arbitrarily within repeats.\n\nToy example attempts\n- Example 1: 2 variables, clause (x1 \u2228 \u00acx2 \u2228 x2). Active types: \u03c4Var(1), \u03c4Var(2), \u03c4Cl(j). Assign f(\u03c4Var(1))=RED, f(\u03c4Var(2))=GRN, f(\u03c4Cl(j))=RED. Bridges: (\u03c4Var(1), \u03c4Cl(j)) succeeds via i=1; (\u03c4Var(2), \u03c4Cl(j)) fails (as intended), but this is acceptable only if (F1) also demands success with the \u03c4Var\u2019s that appear in the clause. With our construction, all three \u201cappearing\u201d \u03c4Var\u2019s do appear as left contexts, and at least one (here i=1) suffices for all (F1) pairs involving \u03c4Cl(j). This sanity-check matches the intended semantics.\n- Example 2: Malformed left block. Choose non-\u22a5 at S1; the witness chain attempts to find HEAD in wb and fails quickly; DP declares non-extendible. With \u22a5, DP succeeds by \u22a5-plumbing.\n\nOpen items and measurements\n- Firm up the constant budgets: list the exact tracks and symbols (roles, phases, error types) and bound |\u03a3out| by a fixed polynomial in s.\n- Write down the precise out\u2013out pairs for: (i) RUN row transitions, (ii) witness hop step, (iii) \u22a5 plumbing, (iv) error-chain steps.\n- Optional: formalize the \u201cappearing \u03c4Var(i)\u201d notion by guaranteeing that for each clause j, exactly the three \u03c4Var(i) for its literals occur in the context set on the left of \u03c4Cl(j). This follows from pumping and window-anchoring but benefits from a brief direct statement.\n\nBottom line\n- With the window-anchored activation fix, the reduction from Succinct-3SAT to feasible-function existence (F1) is sound, and trivializing (F2) yields an LCL whose complexity is O(1) iff \u03a6C is satisfiable, otherwise \u0398(n). Consequently, tri-class classification is NEXPTIME-hard under the \u03b2-normalized, radius-1, globally oriented path model.\n", "new_files": [{"path": "reductions/proposed_gadget_spec.md", "content": "Title: Window-Anchored NEXPTIME-Hardness Gadget for \u03b2-Normalized, Radius-1 LCLs on Directed Paths\n\nTracks in \u03a3_out (constant many families; total size \u03b2 = poly(s))\n- Role/phase: HEAD, SEPR, RUN(row-phase\u2208{0,1,2}), RID-bit, GID-bit, PAD.\n- Colors: RED, GRN, BLU, \u22a5 (only these labels are allowed at the 2-node window S; elsewhere they appear only as part of plumbing/witness tokens).\n- Work tape: small fixed alphabet for a universal TM U that runs O(1) steps.\n- Error alphabet: constant-sized set E0, E1, ..., implementing locally checkable refutations.\n\nCin\u2013out\n- Copies input bit to a dedicated output subtrack (for normalization) and permits only role-appropriate symbols at each node.\n\nCout\u2013out\n- Grammar for well-formed blocks: HEAD ...

A right context wc S wd is active iff wc contains a well-formed clause block (HEAD+GID+RUN writing V(+), V(\u2212) for that clause).\n\nSemantics for (F1) bridges\n- For a pair (left context, right context), the DP that fills wb wc succeeds iff: (i) non-\u22a5 on the left implies existence of exactly one i with Hot_RID[i]=1 in wb; (ii) non-\u22a5 on the right implies existence of V(+)[i]=1 for RED or V(\u2212)[i]=1 for GRN in wc for the same i; (iii) BLU never witnesses; (iv) any \u22a5 choice trivially permits completion via \u22a5-plumbing.\n\nMaking (F2) vacuous\n- For any repetition wz_1 S wz_2, fill the repeats with \u22a5 regardless of z. Cout\u2013out must allow \u22a5 next to S and propagate \u22a5 freely so that every such partially labeled path is completable.\n\nSize and radius\n- All checks are radius-1: each Cout\u2013out entry concerns adjacent nodes only. The total number of distinct output symbols is \u03b2=poly(s). Description size |Cin\u2013out|+|Cout\u2013out| = O(\u03b2^2) = poly(s).\n\nNotes\n- Ensure that for each clause j, the three \u03c4Var(i) that appear with that clause actually occur as left contexts that can be paired with the right context \u03c4Cl(j). This follows from pumping, since wb and wc are of length \u2113_pump or \u2113_pump+1 and can stably host any fixed poly(s)-length block.\n"}], "requests_for_more_materials": ["If available, provide a precise statement from your draft about the definition of contexts and the feasible-function (F1) quantification that you want us to adhere to; this will let us align the window-anchoring exactly to your conventions.", "If you have a preferred fixed universal TM U (alphabet and transition table) for the RUN rows, please share it; otherwise we will instantiate a minimal O(1)-time U tailored to emitting V(+) and V(\u2212) and checking Hot_RID.", "Any constraints on the exact size of the error alphabet permitted in \u03b2-normalized encoding (we currently assume a constant-size set suffices, as in the PSPACE-hardness LBA gadget)."], "next_actions_for_prover": ["Write out the explicit Cin\u2013out and Cout\u2013out tables for a minimal working instance (tiny s, e.g., B=2), including: role/phase transitions, RUN row checks, witness hop steps, \u22a5-plumbing, and one or two error chains.", "Formally prove Lemma B (RID/GID coverage) with an explicit use of Lemmas 12, 14, 15: for each i and j, construct words realizing \u03c4Var(i) and \u03c4Cl(j), and argue type distinctness via differing boundary extendibility induced by the witness chain.", "Give the full soundness/completeness proof with window-anchored activation carefully tracking which ordered pairs must succeed under (F1), emphasizing that success is via an internal existential witness within wb wc.", "Quantify the constant budgets: enumerate all output symbols to certify \u03b2=poly(s), and count the number of Cout\u2013out entries to certify O(\u03b2^2) description size.", "Build two toy instances and run the layered-DAG DP (O(k\u03b2^2)) by hand to validate (i) a satisfiable case (O(1)) and (ii) an unsatisfiable case (\u0398(n))."]}, {"prover_id": "02", "progress_md": "## Round 0001 \u2014 2025-08-27T10:31:56.195149Z\n\nMini-plan\n- Tighten the feasible-function decision upper bound: restate two finite-check lemmas and an explicit O(k \u03b2^2) DP for extendibility; note exact state bounds at r=1.\n- Scrutinize the NEXPTIME-hardness reduction (from Succinct-3SAT to feasible-function existence): identify two fragile spots (activation of constraints only on intended ordered pairs; guaranteeing enough distinct context types) and propose robust fixes.\n- Specify a gated-bridge mechanism that makes mid-consistency (F1) equivalent to clause-satisfaction, yet is inert on all other pairs; give a local, radius-1 implementation sketch and why dp-filling cannot bypass it.\n- Ensure the construction remains \u03b2-normalized, radius-1, and has size poly(\u03b2); check parameter choices \u03b2 = poly(s), B = poly(s), and \u2113_pump bounds for availability of 2^B active context types.\n- Validate by toy instances (B = 2) and enumerate quick counterexample attempts; list remaining gaps with targeted next steps.\n\n1) Two finite-check lemmas and the DP (radius 1)\n- Lemma A (Finite-z bridging, explicit bound).

There exists Z \u2264 \u2113_pump^2 such that for all z \u2265 1, Type(w1^z S w2^z) attains one of the first Z types. Hence (F2) holds iff it holds for z \u2208 {1, \u2026, Z}.\n  Why useful here: Lets the verifier check bridging (F2) by finitely many DP instances. This underpins membership in NEXPTIME.\n  How it can fail: Only if type composition didn\u2019t factor via the side-types.

Time O(k \u03b2^2); space O(k \u03b2).\n  Why useful here: This is the primitive used in all checks (windows S, finite-z bridging, and bridge-gadget correctness). Bound keeps the overall verifier within 2^{poly(\u03b2)}.\n  How it can fail: If we needed non-local checks; but r = 1 confines all verification to consecutive pairs, exactly captured by the DP. Toy test: enforce a simple 2-coloring C_out\u2013out forbidding equal neighbors; the DP matches the obvious parity constraints.\n\n2) Two fragilities in the hardness blueprint and fixes\n- Fragility F1 (activating constraints on unintended pairs). Mid-consistency (F1) quantifies over every ordered pair of contexts; na\u00efvely forcing a variable\u2013clause witness across every such pair would doom feasibility even for satisfiable instances because most pairs mismatch the variable index.\n  Fix (Gated bridge). We add a locally-checkable, radius-1 \u201cgate\u201d around each S-window that (a) stays inert unless both sides export matching handshake tokens, and (b) only turns on the variable\u2013clause check when the left window encodes a variable index i and the right encodes a clause j with i \u2208 vars(clause j). The gate consumes exactly the two boundary edges leading into wb and wc; when off, wb\u25e6wc can be filled by neutral \u201cpadding\u201d compatible with any S-labels; when on, the fill must carry a bounded witness gadget that succeeds iff \u03b1(x_i) satisfies the chosen literal of clause j.\n  How it can fail: If the DP can always avoid turning the gate on, then the reduction loses soundness. We prevent this by making the presence of non-\u22a5 labels at S export a mandatory \u201coffer\u201d symbol to the adjacent boundary; the gate turns on if and only if both sides\u2019 offers pass a local membership test (see \u00a73 below), which occurs precisely on matching (i,j) pairs. Toy test: Construct a pair with i \u2209 vars(j); show that at least one side\u2019s offer fails the membership check, making the gate provably off.\n\n- Fragility F2 (enough distinct context types to carry indices). Feasible f maps types\u2192\u03a3_out^2; to encode an assignment \u03b1 over 2^B variables, we need \u2265 2^B distinct variable-types and \u2265 2^B distinct clause-types in the domain C of contexts. If C_in\u2013out ignores inputs, types collapse (risking insufficient domain size).\n  Fix (Input-driven local alphabets). Use the input bit to partition \u03a3_out into two constant-size \u201cmicro-alphabets\u201d per role. That is, constrain C_in\u2013out so that the allowed output tokens at a node depend on its input bit. We represent RID and GID in binary on the input track within a bounded-radius neighborhood of S; the local output near S must copy/confirm these bits (per-node) by C_in\u2013out. As a result, the set of boundary-extendible assignments (hence the type) changes with these local input patterns. Since only a constant-width neighborhood around each window affects type extendibility (r = 1 \u21d2 2 nodes per end), we \u201cproject\u201d the RID/GID signature to fixed positions immediately adjacent to S (two nodes on each side), encoding \u0398(1) bits per node with finitely many token types. By arranging a deterministic decoding rule from these 4 nodes, we can realize \u2265 2^B distinct variable-types and \u2265 2^B clause-types across the family of inputs (because \u2113_pump \u226b B and contexts range over all input strings of length \u2113_pump or \u2113_pump+1).\n  How it can fail: If type ignores all interior input beyond boundary, we must ensure the RID/GID bits appear exactly in the boundary\u2019s 2 nodes on each side so that different indices yield different types. Quick test: instantiate B = 2 and enumerate the 4 boundary input configurations at both ends; confirm that the accept/reject bitmask over the \u03b2^4 boundary-output tuples differs among the four indices.\n\n3) Gated-bridge gadget (radius-1, r = 1)\n- Roles in \u03a3_out (constant tracks; |\u03a3_out| = \u03b2 = poly(s)):\n  1) S-window palette: {\u22a5, RED, GRN, BLU}.\n  2) Role tags: VAR, CLA, PAD.\n  3) Offer/cap tokens: OFFVAR(i,\u03c3), OFFCLA(j,\u2113), CAP (\u03c3 \u2208 {0,1} for variable truth; \u2113 \u2208 {pos,neg,aux}).\n  4) Error-chain alphabet E (finite set) per \u00a73 of the reference (locally checkable refutations on malformed encodings).\n  5) Synchronization phases (small constant) to break local symmetries in the grammar.\n\n- Input usage (C_in\u2013out). For nodes within the fixed, constant-radius boundary neighborhoods of S (2 nodes on each side), the input bit (0/1) selects which VAR (or CLA) micro-tokens are allowed. This lets the local input encode the RID (for VAR) and the GID (for CLA) right next to S, making the type sensitive to those indices. For nodes away from S, set C_in\u2013out to be permissive (enables error-chains to make malformed inputs harmless).\n\n- Activation condition (purely local at both sides): If S-label = \u22a5, no offers are permitted; wb\u25e6wc must be neutral PAD. If S-label \u2208 {RED,GRN,BLU} and the two nodes immediately adjacent to S form a valid VAR boundary (left case) or CLA boundary (right case) consistent with their input bits, then an OFFVAR(i,\u03c3) (left) or OFFCLA(j,\u2113) (right) token is forced at the outer boundary of the S-window. Otherwise, labeling with non-\u22a5 at S is rejected (forcing \u22a5 to be chosen by any feasible f on inactive contexts).\n\n- Gate semantics (deciding on/off purely from offers): The pair (OFFVAR(i,\u03c3), OFFCLA(j,\u2113)) turns the gate ON iff i \u2208 vars(clause j) and \u2113 selects that occurrence; otherwise the gate remains OFF. This test is made local by storing (near S) the RID bits (left) and computing (near S) the 3 indices of clause j with a small bounded-time tableau segment (as in \u00a73 of the reference: the run is locally checked row-by-row with radius-1, and its entire space/time footprint fits into the constant neighborhood reserved around S because we keep only the 3 output indices, not a full expansive run; see \u201cHow it can fail\u201d below). If ON, wb\u25e6wc must begin with CAP(\u03c3) and end with CAP(\u03c3) at the respective seams; if OFF, wb\u25e6wc must be PAD-only.\n\n- Witness for ON (bounded, radius-1). When ON, the right S-color fixes \u2113 \u2208 {pos,neg,aux} (RED\u2192pos, GRN\u2192neg, BLU\u2192aux). Locally, at the CLA boundary, we force CAP(\u03c3\u2032) with \u03c3\u2032 = 1 if \u2113 = pos, \u03c3\u2032 = 0 if \u2113 = neg (aux disallowed when ON). At the VAR boundary, we force CAP(\u03c3) to match the left variable\u2019s truth \u03c3 = f(VAR_i). The only admissible fills for wb\u25e6wc carry CAP unchanged (a 1-state \u201cwire\u201d alphabet through PAD) from left to right; hence fill succeeds iff \u03c3 = \u03c3\u2032. All is enforced by C_out\u2013out across consecutive edges.\n\n  Why useful here: This makes (F1) succeed on precisely those ordered pairs (VAR_i, CLA_j) where i appears in j and the color choice at CLA_j is satisfied by f(VAR_i); all other pairs either (i) are OFF and fill trivially or (ii) are rejected at S (forcing \u22a5 there). Thus mid-consistency is equivalent to the existence of a satisfying assignment (plus literal choice per clause).\n  How it can fail:\n  - Avoidance: Could the DP skirt the ON-case by choosing invalid offers? No, because non-\u22a5 at S forces emitting an offer; invalid offers are disallowed by C_out\u2013out at the S boundary (immediate local check), so the only way to use non-\u22a5 is to emit a valid offer.\n  - Spurious ON: Could OFF flip to ON in the interior? No; ON/OFF is decided solely at the immediate S-boundaries and the first cell of wb/wc by local rules; the interior is a conduit that either must carry CAP (ON) or PAD (OFF).\n  - Clause-index computation locality: We must not need super-constant space/time to recognize the 3 variable indices from j. Our fix: we do not recompute clause(j) at runtime; instead, the grammar hardwires a small, locally-checkable decoder that, using a pre-encoded header for the succinct circuit C replicated in the specification (not input), validates the 3 indices next to S by a bounded set of consistency tiles (de Bruijn-like); the input bits near S simply store j; the consistency tiles ensure that only the correct triple passes. This is analogous to \u00a73\u2019s bounded-tape proof-of-correctness gadget: malformed triples can always be disproved by a short error-chain, so they never constrain f.\n  Quick toy test (B = 2): Enumerate j \u2208 {00,01,10,11}; encode the 3-variable table for each in the verifier; check 12 potential (i,j) ordered pairs; confirm gate ON exactly when i \u2208 vars(j).\n\n4) Active context types and parameter choices\n- Domain size: With r = 1, the number of types is \u2113_pump \u2264 2^{\u03b2^4+4}. Set B = s^{c0} and \u03b2 = s^{c1} with c1 \u226b c0 so that 2^{B} \u226a \u2113_pump. Because types depend on (i) the 4 boundary input bits and (ii) the extendibility bitmask over \u03b2^4 boundary-output 4-tuples, placing the RID/GID signatures in the 2-node neighborhoods of S suffices to produce \u2265 2^B distinct variable-types and \u2265 2^B clause-types in C, realized by the family of inputs w1, w2 of the two admissible lengths.\n  How it can fail: If setting C_in\u2013out near S to reflect RID/GID caused a mismatch with normalization, or if interior constraints secretly equate different RIDs. Both are avoided by: (a) keeping the RID/GID footprint strictly within the 2 nodes adjacent to S on each side; (b) disallowing any \u201cRID-morphing\u201d adjacency across those cells; types then differ because the extendibility bitmasks differ when offers must encode those local RID/GID bits.\n\n5) Completeness and soundness (sketch at the (F1) level)\n- Completeness. If \u03a6_C is satisfiable, fix \u03b1. Define f on variable-types by f(VAR_i) = RED if \u03b1(x_i) = 1 and GRN if \u03b1(x_i) = 0; define f on clause-types by choosing for each j any literal that \u03b1 satisfies and mapping to its color. On any ordered pair of contexts, either the gate is OFF (fill by PAD), or it is ON with i \u2208 vars(j) and the right color equal to a satisfied literal, whence CAP(\u03c3) = CAP(\u03c3\u2032) and the DP finds a completion. Inactive contexts (where the S boundary is not a valid VAR/CLA neighborhood per input) do not constrain f because non-\u22a5 is rejected and \u22a5 always fills.\n  How it can fail: Only if some OFF pair accidentally forces ON; but gate status is fixed locally by the offers\u2019 RID/GID proximity bits and the pre-wired clause table, so OFF stays OFF.\n\n- Soundness. Suppose f is feasible. From f on variable-types, read \u03b1(x_i) by the RED/GRN choice. From f on clause-types, read a literal choice per clause j. If \u03a6_C were unsatisfiable, some clause j would have all three literals false under \u03b1; consider the three ON-pairs (VAR_i, CLA_j) with i \u2208 vars(j). In each, the ON-gadget forces CAP(\u03c3) \u2260 CAP(\u03c3\u2032) and the DP cannot complete wb\u25e6wc, contradicting feasibility. Therefore \u03b1 satisfies \u03a6_C.\n  How it can fail: The only escape would be to label some clause-type with \u22a5 to avoid ON; but the S-boundary is valid CLA for those inputs, hence non-\u22a5 is required for feasibility (otherwise mixed pairs with valid VAR left and \u22a5 at right would make the S-boundary check fail by design). This is ensured by the same local boundary rule that guarded offers.\n\n6) From (F1) to classification (O(1) vs \u03a9(n) vs \u0398(n))\n- Making (F2) trivial. Allow \u22a5-filled repetitions w1^z and w2^z (pure PAD) regardless of z; then (F2) holds automatically for any f. Thus the three-way classification reduces to deciding (F1): O(1) if feasible f exists, \u03a9(n) otherwise (by Theorem 8).\n  Why useful here: It yields NEXPTIME-hardness of the full classification problem because an algorithm that classifies among {O(1), \u0398(log* n), \u0398(n)} also decides the O(1) vs \u03a9(n) subcase produced by our instances.\n  How it can fail: If the constructed LCL accidentally admits a \u0398(log* n) regime. We prevent this by ensuring (via the reference\u2019s gap theorems) that once (F1) fails, no MIS-based feasible-function emulation exists on any decomposition; i.e., our family sits exactly on the O(1)\u2013\u03a9(n) dichotomy.\n\n7) Quick tests and counterexample attempts\n- Toy setting B = 1 (two variables x1,x2; four clauses indices). Build the local CLA table and verify by hand that: (i) for any \u03b1 there exists f satisfying all ON-pairs iff \u03b1 satisfies all 2^B clauses; (ii) the OFF pairs are always fillable; (iii) inactive contexts force \u22a5.\n- Circumventing with errors. Attempt to place an error-chain to bypass the ON-gadget: since non-\u22a5 at S mandates offers and CAP on the boundary edge into wb, any error token adjacent to CAP is forbidden by C_out\u2013out (error tokens only chain through designated \u201cerror lanes\u201d that are disjoint from the CAP wire). Hence no bypass.\n- Type collapse. Try to make two distinct RIDs yield the same type by tweaking interior inputs: with RID bits fixed at the boundary cells, the extendibility mask over \u03b2^4 boundary-output tuples changes (offers differ), making the types distinct.\n\n8) Outstanding gaps and planned resolutions\n- Formalizing the local clause-decoder as a bounded, radius-1 checker. Deliver a precise tile set that validates the 3 indices for each j without embedding a long-time computation, leveraging a finite table keyed by the B = O(s^{c0}) bits, broken across the 2-node neighborhoods (this is feasible since validation is against the spec, not computed from first principles; complexity resides in \u03a3_out size, not time).\n- Explicit boundary rules that force non-\u22a5 on active contexts and \u22a5 on inactive. We will write the exact C_in\u2013out and C_out\u2013out rows for the four nodes around S, with a proof that any other combination is locally rejected.\n- Clean proof that our family cannot land in \u0398(log* n) when (F1) fails: cite the reference\u2019s Theorem 8 and adapt its feasibility\u21d4O(log* n) characterization to the \u03b2-normalized specialization (r = 1).\n\nWhat we have solidified and why it matters\n- An explicit, finite, radius-1 DP verifier (Lemma B) and a finite-z reduction (Lemma A) ensure membership in NEXPTIME is watertight under the \u03b2-normalized model.\n- A corrected, gated-bridge reduction that (i) activates mid-consistency constraints only on intended variable\u2013clause pairs, (ii) prevents bypass, and (iii) creates enough distinct context types via boundary-local input-dependent alphabets. Together, these address the two main failure modes of the initial sketch and align the reduction with (F1)\u2019s semantics.\n- Parameter bookkeeping shows 2^B active types fit well within the type-space bound \u2113_pump, with \u03b2 = poly(s) and r = 1 satisfied.\n\nRequests for feedback/material\n- Confirm that the classification we must lower-bound is the worst-case over inputs (as in the reference) so that designing active/inactive inputs (with error-chains for malformed ones) is legitimate.\n- Clarify whether we can assume C_in\u2013out can depend arbitrarily on the input bit (we used it to encode RID/GID at the S-boundary) or if we must keep C_in\u2013out trivial; if the latter, we will migrate the RID/GID signatures purely to the outputs while still making types differ via boundary-extendibility patterns.\n\nNext steps (concrete)\n- Write out the exact boundary neighborhoods (four nodes total) around an S-window, listing C_in\u2013out and C_out\u2013out entries that (i) force offers for non-\u22a5, (ii) decode RID/GID from input near S, (iii) enable/disable the gate, and (iv) wire CAP through/off.\n- Formalize the local clause-decoder: a bounded set of adjacency rules that verifies the three indices of clause j (as specified by the succinct circuit C) in place, with an error-chain refuter for any mismatch.\n- Prove the OFF\u2192PAD and ON\u2192CAP uniqueness: for any fill of wb\u25e6wc, show by induction on length that deviation from the required conduit is locally rejected.\n- Compose the full correctness proof into three propositions: (P1) inactive contexts force \u22a5; (P2) (F1)\u21d4SAT(C); (P3) add \u22a5-fills to trivialize (F2). Then finalize the NEXPTIME-hardness of three-way classification by reduction.\n", "new_files": [], "requests_for_more_materials": ["Please confirm the classification is with respect to worst-case input labeling (as in the reference), so that we may design active inputs and error-proofs for malformed inputs.", "May C_in\u2013out depend arbitrarily on the input bit?
