High-level assessment
- The upper-bound ingredients (finite number of types for r=1; composition/pumping; DP for extension; finite-Z bound for (F2)) look solid across the reports and are worth recording formally. I have written them up as rigorous lemmas (with proofs) in output.md. They give a clean algorithmic skeleton for feasible-function verification and will be needed regardless of the hardness route.
- The existing hardness sketches via Succinct-3SAT (reports 02–04) still have unresolved quantifier and type-invariance issues. Report 01 correctly identified the core mismatch for (F1) with clause-level existential quantification and proposed pivoting to Succinct 3-Coloring, which aligns with (F1)’s universal pair checks. This is the cleanest route so far and avoids the “exists a satisfied literal” difficulty.
