• The mini-plan is well-structured but needs more depth in analysis.
• Understanding the PSPACE-hardness proof is critical; avoid misinterpretations.
• The NEXPTIME algorithm analysis must be cautious about generalizations.
• Reductions from NEXPTIME-hard problems need careful alignment with LCL structure.
• Exploration of LCL cases should be systematic to ensure complexity representation.
• Formulate lemmas with rigorous testing against edge cases for validity.
