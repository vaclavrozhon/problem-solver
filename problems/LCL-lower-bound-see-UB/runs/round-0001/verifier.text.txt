{"feedback_md":"High-level: both reports move in the right direction. Prover 01 shores up locality via window-anchoring and lays out the shape of the witnesses and error gadgets; Prover 02 correctly identifies the key fragility (pairwise quantification in (F1)) and proposes a gated bridge to isolate intended variable–clause pairs. However, there are still critical gaps/contradictions that must be resolved before the reduction is credible.\n\nKey audit (3-row table):\n| Claim (short) | Status [OK/Unclear/Broken] | Why |\n| Existential witness across each pair (no gate) suffices | Broken | (F1) requires success for every ordered pair of context types. With 01’s “existential i inside the bridge,” any active mismatched pair (Var_k, Cl_j) with k ∉ vars(j) still fails locally, so (F1) would be violated. A concrete counterexample: fix τVar(k) (active) and τCl(j) (active) with k not in j; both non-⊥ choices lead to no valid completion because the left HotRID has its single 1 at k while the clause’s witness can only point to its 3 indices. |\n| 2^B distinct types from 2-node boundary micro-alphabets | Broken | 02’s proposal to encode RID/GID solely in the 2 nodes adjacent to S cannot scale. With r=1, the boundary has at most β choices per node, giving ≤β^4 boundary patterns; for B = poly(s), 2^B ≫ β^4 for any β = poly(s). A counting argument shows you cannot separate exponentially many indices via constant-width boundary signatures. |\n| Constant-time local clause decoder | Broken | Validating that a clause-side header encodes the correct triple of variable indices for j (under a succinct circuit C) cannot be done in O(1) local steps. You need a poly(s)-length tableau (still radius-1) inside wc to check C(j), or an equivalent bounded-width but long run; otherwise malformed triples cannot be ruled out with only constant neighborhoods. |\n\nStrengths and salvageable pieces:\n- 01’s window-anchoring is a solid locality fix: keeping HEAD/RUN/indices entirely within wb/wc ensures the (F1) DP, which fills only wb and wc, “sees” all relevant data.\n- 02’s gated-bridge is the right conceptual fix for the “all ordered pairs” quantification: OFF pairs must be completable regardless of colors; ON pairs only when i∈vars(j) and the chosen literal agrees with f(VAR_i).\n- Both correctly aim to trivialize (F2) via ⊥-plumbing; this seems viable provided seams are fully absorbing and compatible with any S color.\n\nMain corrections needed:\n- Combine 02’s gate with 01’s window-anchoring. Explicitly prove that for any mismatched active pair the bridge is OFF and fills via PAD, while for the three matched pairs it is ON and enforces the literal agreement test.\n- Replace “O(1)-time U” with a poly(s)-length, radius-1 tableau embedded inside wc (and, as needed, inside wb) that locally verifies the clause indices or an equivalent predicate (e.g., checks that V(+)/V(−) bits are the outputs of C(j)). This keeps description size poly(β) while giving enough power to tie outputs to the succinct input.\n- For type multiplicity: do not rely on boundary-only encoding. Use type-distinguishing boundary-extendibility that depends on the interior block content, exposed via the ON/OFF/witness behavior under fixed boundary colors. Give a precise lemma: for each i ≠ i′, some boundary labeling makes τVar(i) extendible and τVar(i′) not, hence types differ.\n- Ensure the “inactive contexts are harmless” argument is fully airtight: non-⊥ must be locally rejected on inactive sides, and ⊥-plumbing must never interact with CAP/error tracks in a way that could accidentally enable an ON-like behavior.\n\nMost valuable next steps to raise confidence:\n- Write the exact boundary C_in–out/C_out–out tables that (i) force offers for non-⊥, (ii) implement the ON/OFF decision purely from offers and preverified headers, (iii) constrain OFF to PAD-only, and (iv) wire CAP through in ON.\n- Provide the poly(s)-length, radius-1 clause-verification tableau with an error-chain refuter for any malformed encoding; quantify its footprint and alphabet budget.\n- Prove a clean “type-separation” lemma: for all i≠i′ there exists a boundary choice at S such that extendibility differs between τVar(i) and τVar(i′); similarly for clauses.\n- Exhibit a complete B=2 toy with full tables and show the DP outcomes on all 12 pairs, confirming OFF/ON behavior and feasibility iff SAT.\n","summary_md":"- The gating idea (Prover 02) is essential: without it, (F1)’s “all ordered pairs” quantification breaks 01’s existential-pointer plan. Adopt gating plus 01’s window anchoring.\n- Two claims are untenable as stated: (i) deriving 2^B distinct types from only 2 boundary nodes; (ii) validating clause triples in O(1) local steps. Both must be replaced with interior, poly(s)-length, radius-1 tableaus inside wb/wc.\n- Window-anchoring is sound and useful; ⊥-plumbing to trivialize (F2) seems feasible if seams are fully absorbing and independent of S.\n- The reduction needs a precise lemma that mismatched active pairs are OFF and always completable, while matched pairs are ON and enforce literal satisfaction.\n- Provide explicit C_in–out/C_out–out tables for the 4 boundary nodes and the conduits (OFF→PAD, ON→CAP), plus the clause-evaluation tableau.\n- Prove a formal type-separation lemma that guarantees ≥2^B variable types and ≥2^B clause types via differing boundary-extendibility, not boundary-only signatures.\n- Validate by a complete B=2 example and DP simulation; then scale the parameter bookkeeping (β, tableau length, |Σ_out|) to poly(s).\n","verdict":"uncertain","blocking_issues":["01’s existential-witness bridge does not satisfy (F1) on mismatched active pairs; must add a gate so OFF pairs always fill and only intended pairs are ON.","02’s boundary-only RID/GID encoding cannot yield ≥2^B distinct types; need interior-dependent extendibility differences (window-anchored blocks).","The clause-side “decoder” cannot be O(1)-time or constant-neighborhood; must embed a poly(s)-length, radius-1 verification tableau tied to the succinct circuit C.","A formal proof is needed that inactive contexts enforce ⊥ locally and that ⊥-plumbing is fully absorbing and compatible with any S color, so (F2) can be made vacuous without side effects.","Precisely cite and match the conditions of the gap theorem used (e.g., Theorem 8: o(n) ⇒ feasible function) to justify the O(1) vs Θ(n) dichotomy for the constructed family.","Show that for each clause j the three corresponding variable types do occur as left contexts paired with τCl(j), and no unintended ON pairs arise."],"per_prover":[{"prover_id":"01","brief_feedback":"Window-anchoring is the right locality fix; the inactive-contexts idea and size bookkeeping are promising.
