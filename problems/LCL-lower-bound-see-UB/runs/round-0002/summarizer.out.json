  "summary_md": "This round formalizes the reduction from Succinct 3-Coloring to Feasible-Function Existence for (F1) on \u03b2-normalized, radius-1 LCLs on paths. Main contributions: a radius-1 boundary-probe family Q_j that reads the j-th bit of a vertex index u (so extendibility under Q_j equals u_j), yielding \u22652^B distinct vertex context types; canonical left/right context shapes L(u), R(v) realizable at lengths \u2113_pump or \u2113_pump+1 whose types are determined by u/v; and a seam gadget that runs a universal TM U in the bridge to evaluate D(u,v) and exposes an Edge bit so the local seam enforces acceptance iff D(u,v)=0 or (D(u,v)=1 and the two S-colors differ). Adding \u22a5-plumbing makes (F2) vacuous, so the 3-way classification reduces to (F1)-feasibility (hence NEXPTIME-hard). The verifier returned \u201cpartial success\u201d: the construction is conceptually complete but key local rule tables and small-radius verification details remain to be written.

    "Radius-1 probe family Q_j: four boundary outputs trigger a deterministic pointer that inspects the j-th bit of an interior port zone; extendibility under Q_j equals the bit value, yielding 2^B distinct vertex types.",
    "Canonical contexts L(u)/R(v): explicit canonical left/right context shapes (|.| \u2208 {\u2113_pump, \u2113_pump+1}) are proposed so each vertex index u/v has a realizable, type-determined representative adjacent to S.",
    "Seam gadget (radius-1): the bridge runs a row-by-row universal TM simulation on inputs (D,u,v), emits an Edge bit, and enforces 'accept iff Edge=0 or (Edge=1 and colors differ)' using only local checks at the seam.",
    "\u22a5-plumbing neutralizes (F2): permit sides to be filled entirely with \u22a5 independent of boundary outputs, making (F2) vacuous and collapsing the tri-class decision to (F1)-feasibility.",
    "Implementation claims about robustness (error-chains for malformed blocks), pumping/replacement to embed blocks at required lengths, and alphabet-size = poly(s) are asserted but not yet written as explicit local tables."

    "Produce the concrete Cout\u2013out/Cin\u2013out local-rule snippets for the probe pointer (boundary token \u2192 deterministic walk \u2192 test on j-th port cell) and prove the iff statement 'extendible under Q_j \u21d4 u_j = 1'.",
    "Specify the seam I/O interface precisely: layout of port zones, how the bridge-run reads and copies the B-bit ports, the per-row local transitions for U, and the final propagation of the Edge bit to the S-adjacent checks.",
    "Write the remaining low-level artifacts: error-chain rules, \u22a5-plumbing tables, and an explicit alphabet/track enumeration showing |\u03a3_out| = \u03b2 = poly(s); then run small sanity DPs (e.g., B=2) to validate the gadgets."
