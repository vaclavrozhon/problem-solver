Core moves: recast (F1) as an implicit exponential SAT over type-choices; replace the previous gate with an equality/inequality witness gate so each clause-side pick activates exactly one variable-side pair; implement clause decoding as a poly(s)-length, radius-1 tableau that exposes (i1,i2,i3) and signs and yields local error-chain refuters for malformed runs; show existence and separability of 2^B variable- and clause-types via window-anchored blocks and differential extendibility; and trivialize (F2) via ⊥-plumbing so the classification reduces to (F1). Together these yield an implicit CNF (Horn-style clauses (¬Y ∨ X)) equivalent to the succinct 3CNF, giving the intended NEXPTIME hardness direction. Remaining concrete artifacts are explicit seam tables, the RUN tile set, a radius-1 exclusivity proof for equality vs inequality certificates, and a full B=2 DP worked example.
