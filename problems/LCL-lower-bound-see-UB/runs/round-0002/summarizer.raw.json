Main contributions: a radius-1 boundary-probe family Q_j that reads the j-th bit of a vertex index u (so extendibility under Q_j equals u_j), yielding ≥2^B distinct vertex context types; canonical left/right context shapes L(u), R(v) realizable at lengths ℓ_pump or ℓ_pump+1 whose types are determined by u/v; and a seam gadget that runs a universal TM U in the bridge to evaluate D(u,v) and exposes an Edge bit so the local seam enforces acceptance iff D(u,v)=0 or (D(u,v)=1 and the two S-colors differ). Adding ⊥-plumbing makes (F2) vacuous, so the 3-way classification reduces to (F1)-feasibility (hence NEXPTIME-hard). The verifier returned “partial success”: the construction is conceptually complete but key local rule tables and small-radius verification details remain to be written.
