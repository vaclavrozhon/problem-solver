  "summary_md": "Round 0002 completed a focused repair and formalization of the reduction from Succinct-3SAT to feasible-function existence for β-normalized, r=1 LCLs. Core moves: recast (F1) as an implicit exponential SAT over type-choices; replace the previous gate with an equality/inequality witness gate so each clause-side pick activates exactly one variable-side pair; implement clause decoding as a poly(s)-length, radius-1 tableau that exposes (i1,i2,i3) and signs and yields local error-chain refuters for malformed runs; show existence and separability of 2^B variable- and clause-types via window-anchored blocks and differential extendibility; and trivialize (F2) via ⊥-plumbing so the classification reduces to (F1). Together these yield an implicit CNF (Horn-style clauses (¬Y ∨ X)) equivalent to the succinct 3CNF, giving the intended NEXPTIME hardness direction. Remaining concrete artifacts are explicit seam tables, the RUN tile set, a radius-1 exclusivity proof for equality vs inequality certificates, and a full B=2 DP worked example.

  "highlights": [
    "Feasible-function existence (F1) was formalized as an implicit exponential SAT instance F(P): variables = f(τ) on active context types; constraints = local bridge DP checks (Claim G / S1).",
    "Patch H / equality-inequality gated bridge: clause S picks an occurrence p (no sign), variable S picks truth; exactly one ordered pair per clause can be ON (equality witness) and enforces sign-consistency; all other pairs are OFF (inequality witness) and accept PAD.",
    "Clause RUN replaced O(1) decoding with a poly(s)-length, radius-1 tableau that outputs (i1,i2,i3) and signs adjacent to S; malformed encodings are locally refutable via error chains (Claims K/H/S4).",
    "Proved existence and separability of exponentially many active types (2^B variable-types and 2^B clause-types) using window-anchored blocks and differential extendibility; separation can be certified by a tester clause j* (Claims J/I/S5).",
    "Showed equivalence to Succinct-3SAT: f-choices map to per-variable truth bits and per-clause literal-pick bits; each clause contributes Horn clauses (¬Y_{j,ℓ} ∨ X_{i_p}=sgn) and OFF pairs are tautologies, so F(P) satisfiable iff Φ_C satisfiable.",
    "Delivered the plan to trivialize (F2) via ⊥-plumbing (so O(1) iff (F1) holds, else Θ(n)), but left low-level seam/tile specifications unfinished."
  ],
  "next_questions": [
    "Produce explicit Cin–out and Cout–out seam tables around S implementing: offer emission on non-⊥ S, ON→CAP conduits (and CAP equality tests), OFF→PAD plumbing, and forbidding ⊥ at S for active contexts (fix noted verifier bug).",
    "Write a step-by-step, radius-1 tile-level proof that equality vs inequality certificates are exclusive and unforgeable (one-hot RID, unique pointers, bit-by-bit compare tiles + impossibility clauses).",
    "Finalize the clause RUN tile set, the error-chain refuter, and a full B=2 worked DP table (list all ordered pairs and DP outcomes) to validate type separation and the SAT-of-types correspondence."
