High-level assessment: All four reports move in a coherent direction (reduce Succinct 3-Coloring to (F1) by separating vertex types and simulating D(u,v) across the seam; neutralize (F2) with a ⊥-filler). The overall plan is promising and consistent with our DP/type framework. However, only informal sketches are given; several key points require correction or formalization before anything can move to output.md.
