- Good: The implicit SAT-of-types viewpoint and the window-anchored, radius-1 clause tableau are consistent with β-normalization and NEXPTIME upper bounds. Patch H (occurrence selection; sign from RUN) fixes the quantifier mismatch cleanly.
- Promising: Equality/inequality-gated bridge (02) should realize “exactly one constrained pair per clause” once exclusivity is formally proved and CAP/PAD conduits are restricted appropriately.
- Broken as stated: Allowing ⊥ at S for active contexts, together with always-available PAD/⊥ plumbing, makes (F1) trivially satisfiable (set f ≡ ⊥). Fix by forbidding ⊥ at S on active contexts (enforce offers/certificates there) while keeping ⊥ forced on inactive contexts.
- Unclear: Sign binding for 02/03. Ensure S’s choice cannot override RUN’s sign; either adopt 01’s O1/O2/O3 or force S’s sign to match RUN locally.
- Unclear: Formal exclusivity of equality vs inequality certificates. Provide a radius-1, step-by-step proof using one-hot RID, unique pointers, and bit-compare tiles that cannot be faked.
- Check: Type-separation proof needs a clean tester j* or an argument that C provides enough separating clauses; ensure any tester does not introduce unintended constraints (make it labelable but neutral in f or isolate via palette).
- Actionables: (i) explicit Cin–out/Cout–out seam tables (offers, ON→CAP, OFF→PAD, ⊥ rules), (ii) clause RUN tile set and error-chain, (iii) Type-Separation Lemma via differential extendibility, (iv) full B=2 DP table.
