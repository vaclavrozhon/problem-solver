\paragraph{One-line summary.}
Prove NEXPTIME-hardness for the following problem. Given a $\beta$-normalized, radius-1 LCL on globally oriented paths, the problem is to decide whether the local complexity of that problem is $O(1)$ vs.\ $\Omega(\log^* n)$ vs.\ $\Omega(n)$.


\section*{Problem setup}


We work in the standard \textsc{Local} model on globally oriented paths. An LCL is \emph{$\beta$-normalized (radius 1)} if it has:
\begin{itemize}
  \item binary input alphabet $\SigIn=\{0,1\}$,
  \item output alphabet $\SigOut$ of size $\beta$,
  \item legality checked only by two tables: $\Cinout\subseteq\SigIn\times\SigOut$ and $\Coutout\subseteq\SigOut\times\SigOut$.
\end{itemize}
A labeling is legal iff $(\mathrm{in}(v),\mathrm{out}(v))\in \Cinout$ at each node $v$ and $(\mathrm{out}(u),\mathrm{out}(v))\in \Coutout$ on each directed edge $u\!\to\! v$.


\paragraph{Encoding size.}
We assume an explicit encoding of $(\Cinout,\Coutout)$ of size $\mathrm{poly}(\beta)$ (e.g., $\Cinout$ as a $2\times \beta$ Boolean table and $\Coutout$ as a $\beta\times \beta$ Boolean table). We measure time in the input length $N=\mathrm{poly}(\beta)$.


\paragraph{Your task}
Your task is to prove that this task is hard as possible. Aim for NEXPTIME-hardness. 


\paragraph{First attached paper}
The attached paper proves that the problem is PSPACE-hard. Their reduction shows that one can encode the execution of an automaton as a local problem. You have to understand that paper thoroughly, since your goal is to improve upon their result. However, that proof does not easily generalize – it is important that the tape of the simulated automaton has polynomial length, which naively cannot lead to a better than PSPACE hardness. 


\paragraph{Second attached draft}
The attached draft shows the sketch of a proof of a better NEXPTIME algorithm than the one in the original paper. This may give you some intuition about the computational bottleneck that can be used to prove hardness.

  Why useful here: This makes (F1) succeed on precisely those ordered pairs (VAR_i, CLA_j) where i appears in j and the color choice at CLA_j is satisfied by f(VAR_i); all other pairs either (i) are OFF and fill trivially or (ii) are rejected at S (forcing ⊥ there). Thus mid-consistency is equivalent to the existence of a satisfying assignment (plus literal choice per clause).
  How it can fail:
  - Avoidance: Could the DP skirt the ON-case by choosing invalid offers? No, because non-⊥ at S forces emitting an offer; invalid offers are disallowed by C_out–out at the S boundary (immediate local check), so the only way to use non-⊥ is to emit a valid offer.
  - Spurious ON: Could OFF flip to ON in the interior? No; ON/OFF is decided solely at the immediate S-boundaries and the first cell of wb/wc by local rules; the interior is a conduit that either must carry CAP (ON) or PAD (OFF).
  - Clause-index computation locality: We must not need super-constant space/time to recognize the 3 variable indices from j. Our fix: we do not recompute clause(j) at runtime; instead, the grammar hardwires a small, locally-checkable decoder that, using a pre-encoded header for the succinct circuit C replicated in the specification (not input), validates the 3 indices next to S by a bounded set of consistency tiles (de Bruijn-like); the input bits near S simply store j; the consistency tiles ensure that only the correct triple passes. This is analogous to §3’s bounded-tape proof-of-correctness gadget: malformed triples can always be disproved by a short error-chain, so they never constrain f.
  Quick toy test (B = 2): Enumerate j ∈ {00,01,10,11}; encode the 3-variable table for each in the verifier; check 12 potential (i,j) ordered pairs; confirm gate ON exactly when i ∈ vars(j).

4) Active context types and parameter choices
- Domain size: With r = 1, the number of types is ℓ_pump ≤ 2^{β^4+4}. Set B = s^{c0} and β = s^{c1} with c1 ≫ c0 so that 2^{B} ≪ ℓ_pump. Because types depend on (i) the 4 boundary input bits and (ii) the extendibility bitmask over β^4 boundary-output 4-tuples, placing the RID/GID signatures in the 2-node neighborhoods of S suffices to produce ≥ 2^B distinct variable-types and ≥ 2^B clause-types in C, realized by the family of inputs w1, w2 of the two admissible lengths.
  How it can fail: If setting C_in–out near S to reflect RID/GID caused a mismatch with normalization, or if interior constraints secretly equate different RIDs. Both are avoided by: (a) keeping the RID/GID footprint strictly within the 2 nodes adjacent to S on each side; (b) disallowing any “RID-morphing” adjacency across those cells; types then differ because the extendibility bitmasks differ when offers must encode those local RID/GID bits.

5) Completeness and soundness (sketch at the (F1) level)
- Completeness. If Φ_C is satisfiable, fix α. Define f on variable-types by f(VAR_i) = RED if α(x_i) = 1 and GRN if α(x_i) = 0; define f on clause-types by choosing for each j any literal that α satisfies and mapping to its color. On any ordered pair of contexts, either the gate is OFF (fill by PAD), or it is ON with i ∈ vars(j) and the right color equal to a satisfied literal, whence CAP(σ) = CAP(σ′) and the DP finds a completion. Inactive contexts (where the S boundary is not a valid VAR/CLA neighborhood per input) do not constrain f because non-⊥ is rejected and ⊥ always fills.
  How it can fail: Only if some OFF pair accidentally forces ON; but gate status is fixed locally by the offers’ RID/GID proximity bits and the pre-wired clause table, so OFF stays OFF.

- Soundness. Suppose f is feasible. From f on variable-types, read α(x_i) by the RED/GRN choice. From f on clause-types, read a literal choice per clause j. If Φ_C were unsatisfiable, some clause j would have all three literals false under α; consider the three ON-pairs (VAR_i, CLA_j) with i ∈ vars(j). In each, the ON-gadget forces CAP(σ) ≠ CAP(σ′) and the DP cannot complete wb◦wc, contradicting feasibility. Therefore α satisfies Φ_C.
  How it can fail: The only escape would be to label some clause-type with ⊥ to avoid ON; but the S-boundary is valid CLA for those inputs, hence non-⊥ is required for feasibility (otherwise mixed pairs with valid VAR left and ⊥ at right would make the S-boundary check fail by design). This is ensured by the same local boundary rule that guarded offers.

6) From (F1) to classification (O(1) vs Ω(n) vs Θ(n))
- Making (F2) trivial. Allow ⊥-filled repetitions w1^z and w2^z (pure PAD) regardless of z; then (F2) holds automatically for any f. Thus the three-way classification reduces to deciding (F1): O(1) if feasible f exists, Ω(n) otherwise (by Theorem 8).
  Why useful here: It yields NEXPTIME-hardness of the full classification problem because an algorithm that classifies among {O(1), Θ(log* n), Θ(n)} also decides the O(1) vs Ω(n) subcase produced by our instances.
  How it can fail: If the constructed LCL accidentally admits a Θ(log* n) regime. We prevent this by ensuring (via the reference’s gap theorems) that once (F1) fails, no MIS-based feasible-function emulation exists on any decomposition; i.e., our family sits exactly on the O(1)–Ω(n) dichotomy.

7) Quick tests and counterexample attempts
- Toy setting B = 1 (two variables x1,x2; four clauses indices). Build the local CLA table and verify by hand that: (i) for any α there exists f satisfying all ON-pairs iff α satisfies all 2^B clauses; (ii) the OFF pairs are always fillable; (iii) inactive contexts force ⊥.
- Circumventing with errors. Attempt to place an error-chain to bypass the ON-gadget: since non-⊥ at S mandates offers and CAP on the boundary edge into wb, any error token adjacent to CAP is forbidden by C_out–out (error tokens only chain through designated “error lanes” that are disjoint from the CAP wire). Hence no bypass.
- Type collapse. Try to make two distinct RIDs yield the same type by tweaking interior inputs: with RID bits fixed at the boundary cells, the extendibility mask over β^4 boundary-output tuples changes (offers differ), making the types distinct.

8) Outstanding gaps and planned resolutions
- Formalizing the local clause-decoder as a bounded, radius-1 checker. Deliver a precise tile set that validates the 3 indices for each j without embedding a long-time computation, leveraging a finite table keyed by the B = O(s^{c0}) bits, broken across the 2-node neighborhoods (this is feasible since validation is against the spec, not computed from first principles; complexity resides in Σ_out size, not time).
- Explicit boundary rules that force non-⊥ on active contexts and ⊥ on inactive. We will write the exact C_in–out and C_out–out rows for the four nodes around S, with a proof that any other combination is locally rejected.
- Clean proof that our family cannot land in Θ(log* n) when (F1) fails: cite the reference’s Theorem 8 and adapt its feasibility⇔O(log* n) characterization to the β-normalized specialization (r = 1).

What we have solidified and why it matters
- An explicit, finite, radius-1 DP verifier (Lemma B) and a finite-z reduction (Lemma A) ensure membership in NEXPTIME is watertight under the β-normalized model.
- A corrected, gated-bridge reduction that (i) activates mid-consistency constraints only on intended variable–clause pairs, (ii) prevents bypass, and (iii) creates enough distinct context types via boundary-local input-dependent alphabets. Together, these address the two main failure modes of the initial sketch and align the reduction with (F1)’s semantics.
- Parameter bookkeeping shows 2^B active types fit well within the type-space bound ℓ_pump, with β = poly(s) and r = 1 satisfied.

Requests for feedback/material
- Confirm that the classification we must lower-bound is the worst-case over inputs (as in the reference) so that designing active/inactive inputs (with error-chains for malformed ones) is legitimate.
- Clarify whether we can assume C_in–out can depend arbitrarily on the input bit (we used it to encode RID/GID at the S-boundary) or if we must keep C_in–out trivial; if the latter, we will migrate the RID/GID signatures purely to the outputs while still making types differ via boundary-extendibility patterns.

Next steps (concrete)
- Write out the exact boundary neighborhoods (four nodes total) around an S-window, listing C_in–out and C_out–out entries that (i) force offers for non-⊥, (ii) decode RID/GID from input near S, (iii) enable/disable the gate, and (iv) wire CAP through/off.
- Formalize the local clause-decoder: a bounded set of adjacency rules that verifies the three indices of clause j (as specified by the succinct circuit C) in place, with an error-chain refuter for any mismatch.
- Prove the OFF→PAD and ON→CAP uniqueness: for any fill of wb◦wc, show by induction on length that deviation from the required conduit is locally rejected.
- Compose the full correctness proof into three propositions: (P1) inactive contexts force ⊥; (P2) (F1)⇔SAT(C); (P3) add ⊥-fills to trivialize (F2). Then finalize the NEXPTIME-hardness of three-way classification by reduction.

## Round 0002 — 2025-08-27T11:23:07.543978Z

Mini-plan
- Recast the FFE(F1) feasibility question as an implicit (succinct) SAT instance: variables are f-values on active types, constraints are the bridge-completion checks; show that our LCL makes these constraints equivalent to the Succinct-3SAT instance via a gate with an equality/inequality witness.
- Specify a corrected ON/OFF gate: clause-side precommits (via S2 color) to one of its 3 indices and a sign; pairs with a left RID equal to that index are ON and enforce consistency with the variable’s color; other pairs are provably OFF and accept PAD via an inequality witness.
- Replace any O(1)-time clause computation with a poly(s)-length, radius-1 tableau inside wc (and the analogous RID one-hot in wb), with error chains to refute malformed encodings; keep all semantics window-anchored in wb/wc.
- State and test the key lemmas: (G) ON/OFF correctness via equality/inequality witnesses; (H) clause-tableau correctness; (I) type-separation from differential extendibility; (J) equivalence to a succinct SAT instance.
- List explicit artifacts to produce next: boundary C_in–out/C_out–out tables for offers and conduits; the RUN tableau tiles; a complete B=2 worked example with DP outcomes.

1) Gate with equality/inequality witnesses (one constrained pair per clause)
Claim G (Equality/inequality-gated bridge). For each clause-side active context wc S2 wd, allow S2 colors from a 7-token palette: {⊥} ∪ {REDp, GRNp : p ∈ {1,2,3}}. The right context (wc) contains a verified triple (i1,i2,i3) and exposes subtracks Select(p) that copy the chosen position p committed by the S2 color. For a left active variable-side context wa S1 wb with RID = iL (one-hot HotRID), the bridge wb wc is fillable iff exactly one of the following locally-checkable certificates is provided by the filler (and the other is impossible):
- Equality certificate (ON): “iL = i_{Select}”. This is checked by a radius-1 witness chain that (i) reads the unique 1 in HotRID at position iL in wb, (ii) reads the selected triple position p in wc and the corresponding index ip, (iii) follows an ip-pointer to a one-hot at position ip inside wc, and (iv) proves ip = iL by comparing bit-by-bit along a fixed binary-expansion compare path. If the equality certificate passes, the filler must propagate a CAP bit from left to right and enforce consistency of the chosen sign with the left variable’s color: REDp requires f(Var_{iL}) = RED, GRNp requires f(Var_{iL}) = GRN. 
- Inequality certificate (OFF): “iL ≠ i_{Select}”. This is certified by guessing the unique 1 in HotRID (position iL) and comparing with the selected index ip; the chain must exhibit a bit position b where iL[b] ≠ ip[b], using radius-1 checkers at the corresponding b-th cells on both sides. If the inequality certificate passes, the only admissible fill is PAD (a neutral plumbing language), with no CAP signal and no dependence on colors.
Exactly one of these two certificates is realizable in any given pair: the grammar forbids fabricating a mismatch when iL = ip and forbids fabricating equality when iL ≠ ip. Hence for each clause-type instance, exactly one left variable-type (the chosen ip) is constrained (ON), and all other left types are unconstrained (OFF) but completable.
- Why useful here: This resolves the “all ordered pairs” quantification: mid-consistency requires a completion for every pair, but only the single pair whose RID equals the clause’s committed index is forced to check sign-consistency; the rest admit inequality witnesses and fill trivially. Thus per clause we impose precisely one literal check.
- How it can fail: (i) If the inequality proof could be faked even when iL = ip, a mismatching OFF-fill might bypass the literal check; (ii) if equality could be certified when iL ≠ ip, a spurious ON check may wrongly constrain an unrelated variable; (iii) if the sign-consistency does not bind to the left variable’s f-color, the clause constraint evaporates.
- Quick test: Take clause triple (i1,i2,i3) = (3,7,10), and S2 = RED2 (selects i2 = 7). Pair with Var_7: equality path exists; ON requires f(Var_7) = RED. Pair with Var_3: inequality path exists (compare 3 vs 7; they differ at the 1st bit), PAD fill succeeds, no constraint. Pair with Var_9 (not in clause): still inequality since 9 ≠ 7, PAD fill.

2) Clause tableau and window anchoring
Claim H (Clause decoding via poly(s)-length, radius-1 tableau; window-anchored). The right active context wc houses a fixed-layout RUN tableau that verifies C(j) for the clause index GID = j and materializes (i1,i2,i3) and their signs, plus auxiliary one-hot encodings and directed pointers to their positions. All verification is by nearest-neighbor tiles: row-by-row TM simulation of a universal U for T = poly(s) steps, with a constant work alphabet and synchronization phases. The left active context wb houses RID and HotRID one-hot. All headers (HEADC), indices (RID/GID), and RUN tiles lie entirely inside wb (variable side) or wc (clause side), adjacent to S; malformed encodings have locally checkable refutations via error chains. 
- Why useful here: Ensures the gate’s local witness chains have the facts they need within wb/wc and that the “selected position p” refers to a real member of the decoded triple. It also removes the earlier O(1)-time fallacy by giving a polynomial-length, radius-1 verification consistent with β-normalization.
- How it can fail: If the RUN did not fully verify the triple or allowed multiple inconsistent triples, the select(p) track could be abused; if error chains were incomplete, malformed contexts might constrain f.
- Quick test: Implement a toy U that decodes a 2-bit GID and outputs three hard-wired indices (for B=2). Create a malformed wc that spoofs Select(2) but without a legitimate (i1,i2,i3); check that an error-chain can be triggered locally, making the context inactive (only ⊥ at S is completable).

3) Type-separation by differential extendibility
Claim I (Distinct active types per RID and per GID). For β = poly(s), choose B = poly(s) with 2^B ≪ ℓ_pump. Then there exist 2^B left active context types Var_i (with RID = i) and 2^B right active context types Cl_j (with GID = j). Moreover, Var_i ≠ Var_{i'} for i ≠ i' and Cl_j ≠ Cl_{j'} for j ≠ j'. Separation proof sketch: fix any clause-type τR that, by RUN, decodes a triple including i but not i'. Commit S2 = REDp to the position p with ip = i. For the pair (Var_i, τR), equality is forced (ON) and fill exists if and only if f(Var_i) = RED. For (Var_{i'}, τR), inequality is forced (OFF) and fill exists regardless of f(Var_{i'}). Therefore, the boundary-extendibility signatures with S1 fixed to RED differ between Var_i and Var_{i'}, implying distinct types. Similarly for Cl_j using a fixed Var_i and toggling which Select(p) is legal according to RUN, we separate clause types by their decoded triples.
- Why useful here: We need exponentially many active types to encode all variables and clauses generated by the succinct circuit; distinctness is certified by different extendibility outcomes under fixed boundary labels, which the type definition captures.
- How it can fail: If the equality/inequality partitioning could be overridden by the filler (e.g., both certificates could succeed), the extendibility signatures could collapse; if RUN did not uniquely determine the triple, clause types might merge.
- Quick test: Let B=3, pick j with triple (2,5,7). Compare Var_5 vs Var_6 against Cl_j, S2 = GRN2 (selects 5). DP result differs: (Var_5, Cl_j) fill depends on f(Var_5); (Var_6, Cl_j) fill is always PAD. Distinctness follows.

4) Succinct SAT view of FFE(F1)
Claim J (Implicit SAT encoding). The existence of f is equivalent to the satisfiability of a succinct CNF Φ’ over variables: 
- For each Var_i: a Boolean v_i ∈ {RED,GRN} (two colors suffice; BLU only used as inactive/dummy and disallowed for active Var_i), encoding α(x_i).
- For each Cl_j: a 6-ary choice c_j ∈ {RED1,RED2,RED3,GRN1,GRN2,GRN3} selecting one position p ∈ {1,2,3} and a sign.
Constraints: For every ordered pair (Var_i, Cl_j), the bridge is satisfiable. By Claim G, this reduces to a single literal constraint per j, namely: if c_j = REDp (resp. GRNp) and RUN(j) outputs (i1,i2,i3), then require v_{ip} = RED (resp. v_{ip} = GRN). All other pairs impose only tautologies (inequality witnesses). Thus Φ’ is exactly the succinct 3CNF Φ_C: choose for each clause one literal (p and sign) that is true under α (the v_i’s). 
- Why useful here: It makes explicit the “implicit exponential-sized SAT formula” viewpoint: FFE(F1) is satisfiable iff a succinct CNF with exponentially many clauses (one per pair) is satisfiable; our LCL reduction constructs local constraints that evaluate this succinct CNF.
- How it can fail: If pairs other than the selected one also imposed constraints, Φ’ would be stronger than Φ_C (requiring all three literals to match), breaking soundness; if the selected pair could avoid referencing v_{ip}, completeness would be lost.
- Quick test: Clause j with literals (x3 ∨ ¬x7 ∨ x10). Set c_j = RED1 (select x3). Then the only nontrivial pair is (Var_3, Cl_j), enforcing v_3 = RED. Pairs (Var_7, Cl_j) and (Var_10, Cl_j) are OFF and PAD-fillable. Across all j, existence of α (the v_i’s) and c_j’s satisfying all selected pairs is equivalent to Φ_C satisfiable.

5) Radius-1 and β-normalized implementation sanity
Claim K (β-normalized, radius-1). 
- Σ_out tracks (constant many): role/phase, color tokens {⊥, REDp, GRNp}, CAP/PAD conduits, RID/GID one-hot lanes and their pointers, RUN tiles for U, error-chain symbols. 
- Cin–out: copies input bit to an “in-copy” subtrack and gates role legality (e.g., only S admits {⊥, REDp, GRNp}). 
- Cout–out: regular-language grammar for blocks; nearest-neighbor consistency for RUN rows; local tiles for equality/inequality witnesses and for CAP/PAD conduits; absorbing ⊥-plumbing that can fill repetitions (used later to trivialize (F2)). All checks are between consecutive nodes; the witness chains advance one node per step.
- Why useful here: Confirms we remain within the β-normalized, r=1 model and keep description size poly(β).
- How it can fail: If equality compare needed nonlocal jumps, or CAP/PAD conduits required 2-hop checks, we would exceed radius-1; we avoid this with “one-bit-per-step” pointer chains and local tiles.
- Quick test: Build a 12-node wc with RUN and a selected p; simulate the equality witness step-by-step next to a matching Var_i wb; ensure all edge checks refer only to consecutive outputs; flip one bit in the index to see equality chain get stuck while inequality chain passes.

6) Trivializing (F2) and mapping to tri-class classification
Claim L ((F2) vacuous via ⊥-plumbing). Extend Cout–out so that any wz_1 and wz_2 repeat can be filled entirely with ⊥, for any S color fixed by f(Type(w1 S w2)). Then (F2) holds automatically; thus for our family, O(1) iff (F1) holds and Θ(n) otherwise (by the standard gap Theorem 8). 
- Why useful here: Gives the desired O(1) vs Θ(n) dichotomy needed for NEXPTIME-hardness of the tri-class classification.
- How it can fail: If ⊥ is not fully absorbing at the seams near S, some contexts might violate (F2); we avoid this by explicit Cout–out entries permitting ⊥ next to any S-color.
- Quick test: Fix an active context and any z; force S and fill both repeats with ⊥; run the DP—should accept due to plumbing rules.

7) Size and succinctness bookkeeping
- Alphabet size: β = poly(s) suffices for: constant role/phase and gate tokens; RUN alphabet for T = poly(s); error chains; and a few colors (7 S-tokens). Cin–out is O(β); Cout–out is O(β^2) as required.
- Type space: ℓ_pump ≤ 2^{Θ(β^4)} = 2^{poly(s)} guarantees enough contexts to realize all 2^B RIDs/GIDs with window-anchored blocks and stability under pumping/replacement.
- Implicit SAT: The induced SAT instance Φ’ has exponentially many variables/clauses in s but is generated by the succinct circuit C and the local LCL tables; FFE(F1) is “does there exist f?” which is equivalent to satisfiability of Φ’. Our reduction from Succinct-3SAT maps C to PC in poly(s) time; Claims G–L give Φ_C satisfiable iff FFE(F1) for PC.

Toy counterexample probes
- Mismatch bypass attempt: Try to fill (Var_k, Cl_j) with k ≠ selected ip using equality chain; it must fail at the first compare bit, forcing the inequality path; DP rejects any attempt to route CAP without proving equality. 
- Multi-select clause cheat: Try to propagate two Select(p) values in wc while choosing a single S2 color; RUN+phase tiles forbid inconsistent select propagation; any duplication triggers an error-chain, deactivating the context.
- Boundary-only spoof: Remove wb’s HEAD marker but keep S1 = REDp; non-⊥ at S forces starting an offer that must find HEAD and RID; missing HEAD triggers the error-chain; only ⊥ is completable.

What remains to be written (explicit artifacts)
- Boundary tables: the exact Cin–out and Cout–out rows for the four nodes around S that (i) restrict S-palette, (ii) export/propagate Select(p) from S2 into wc, (iii) force CAP conduit on equality and forbid it on inequality, (iv) allow PAD otherwise, and (v) allow ⊥-plumbing always.
- RUN tiles: a concrete fixed-tile set for U’s poly(s)-step verification of C(j) and computation of (i1,i2,i3), exposing them as one-hots and pointers, plus error-chain tiles.
- B=2 worked example: instantiate all gadgets for B=2, list the 12 ordered pairs (Var_i, Cl_j), and manually DP-check the outcomes to confirm that only the single selected pair imposes the literal constraint and all others complete via PAD.

Summary of current status
- We repaired the “pairwise quantification” issue by an equality/inequality gate that provably turns only one pair ON per clause-type and makes all others OFF and harmless. This makes (F1) equivalent to a succinct SAT instance where each clause picks one true literal under α.
- We anchored all semantics within wb/wc and replaced constant-time checks with a poly(s)-length, radius-1 RUN tableau, preserving β-normalization.
- We sketched type-separation and the implicit SAT view, aligning with the user’s “implicit exponential-sized SAT” request.

## Round 0002 — 2025-08-27T11:23:07.548697Z

Mini-plan
- Formalize an implicit exponential-sized SAT encoding F(L) whose satisfiability is equivalent to the existence of a feasible function f for a given β-normalized, radius-1 LCL instance L on oriented paths. This cleanly connects (F1) and (F2) to a succinct-SAT instance.
- Specialize the encoding to our reduction family PC (from a succinct 3CNF generator C), using window-anchored active blocks and a gated bridge. Show that F(PC) is essentially the succinct 3SAT instance for C with auxiliary “literal-pick” variables Y.
- State and test three core lemmas: (i) succinct SAT capture of (F1) and (F2) with an explicit 2poly(β) bound, (ii) ON/OFF gate ⇒ CNF constraints of the form (¬Y ∨ X), and (iii) type-separation by boundary-extendibility patterns induced by interior witness behavior (no reliance on 2-node boundaries).
- Patch the previously flagged fragilities: ensure OFF for all unintended pairs (use offer/cap tokens), and move clause-decoding to a poly(s)-length, radius-1 tableau with error-chain refutations.
- Work out a small B=2 toy to validate the SAT constraints and counterexample probes; list next instrumentation (explicit Cin–out/Cout–out tables for the window seam, offers, PAD/CAP conduits, and the tableau seam rules).

1) Encoding feasible-function existence as an implicit exponential-sized SAT
Claim S1 (Succinct-SAT capture of (F1)+(F2)).
Given a β-normalized, radius-1 LCL L on oriented paths, there is a Boolean formula F(L) of size at most 2poly(β), given succinctly by a poly(β)-size circuit, such that F(L) is satisfiable iff there exists a feasible function f (i.e., f passes (F1) and (F2)). Variables are the choice bits of f on each context type τ and the auxiliary bridge/witness choices where needed. The clauses encode: (i) one-hot consistency of f(τ) ∈ Σout^2 on each τ, (ii) for every ordered context pair (τ1, τ2), the “bridge succeeds” constraint computed by the layered DP, and (iii) for (F2), the finitely many repetition lengths z ≤ Z with Z ≤ ℓ_pump^2 (per Lemma 1 in the draft), also checked via the DP.
- Why useful here: It gives a direct NEXPTIME upper bound (already in our draft) and sets up hardness by letting us reduce succinct 3SAT to F(L) through a specific LCL family PC. It cleanly isolates correctness to the equivalence F(L) ⇔ feasible f.
- How it can fail: If the number of context types exceeded 2poly(β) or the DP check needed super-polynomial circuits, the succinct-SAT size would blow up. Also, if (F2) required infinite z checks, we could not confine to finite clauses. Both are avoided by type bounds and periodicity.
- Quick test: For a toy LCL with β = O(1) that enforces proper 2-coloring (no equal neighbors), contexts and pairs are O(1), and F(L) becomes a tiny CNF: per τ choose color, per pair forbid equal-colored windows. The DP is trivial and the formula is equivalent to 2-colorability of the context graph.

Sketch of construction and size: Let T be the type set, |T| = ℓ_pump ≤ 2Θ(β^4). Let C ⊆ T be the context-type set: those realized by w1Sw2 with |wi| ∈ {ℓ_pump, ℓ_pump+1}. Introduce variables {X_{τ,c}} encoding f(τ)=c, with one-hot constraints per τ. For each ordered pair (τ1, τ2) introduce a polynomial-size circuit that runs the O(kβ^2) DP (k = O(ℓ_pump)) on the bridge instance to produce a clause-set forcing the DP to accept. For (F2), for each τ and z ∈ {1,…,Z}, add analogous DP constraints for wz_1Swz_2. The number of τ’s is ≤ ℓ_pump, pairs ≤ ℓ_pump^2, and z’s ≤ ℓ_pump^2. Each DP instance has size polynomial in β and ℓ_pump. Therefore the entire formula is of size at most 2poly(β), given succinctly by a poly(β)-size generator.

2) Specializing to the hardness family PC: ON/OFF gate ⇒ local CNF constraints
Claim S2 (Gated bridge yields per-clause local CNF). For the reduction PC built from a succinct-3CNF generator C (size s), we define Σout and Cout–out so that for every clause index j and its three literals ℓ ∈ {1,2,3}, there is a “literal-pick” color at the clause window S representing a choice Y_{j,ℓ}, and at each variable i there is a 1-bit choice X_i ∈ {RED,GRN} representing α(x_i). Then (F1) on PC translates to the CNF:
- One-hot per clause: exactly one Y_{j,ℓ} is chosen (enforced via one-hot encoding at the clause-side S).
- For each j and each occurrence i of literal ℓ in clause j with sign s ∈ {+,−}, the bridge constraint contributes a Horn clause of the form (¬Y_{j,ℓ} ∨ (X_i = RED)) if s=+, or (¬Y_{j,ℓ} ∨ (X_i = GRN)) if s=−.
All other ordered pairs (including all mismatched (i,j) where Y_{j,ℓ} points to some i′ ≠ i, or where the left/right side is inactive) compile to tautologies thanks to the OFF gate and ⊥-plumbing. Therefore, (F1) is equivalent to the satisfiability of the succinct CNF that encodes “for each clause j, the selected literal is true under α”.
- Why useful here: This resolves the universal quantification across all ordered pairs: OFF pairs impose no constraint, and the ON pair per clause imposes exactly one Horn clause linking the clause’s pick Y_{j,ℓ} to the variable’s truth X_i. It also shows that our (F1) feasibility is precisely succinct-3SAT.
- How it can fail: If the gate could turn ON on unintended pairs (e.g., when Y_{j,ℓ} selects i′ but the pair is with i ≠ i′), we would accumulate impossible constraints across all three i’s and lose completeness. If malformed clause blocks could fake an ON, spurious Horn clauses could be added. We avoid both by: (i) offers/caps at the S boundary that make ON depend only on the clause-side Y pick and the RUN-decoded occurrence i; (ii) a poly(s)-length, radius-1 verifier tableau that pins the three occurrences and signs; malformed encodings divert to error-chains and never activate ON.
- Quick test: Clause j = (x3 ∨ ¬x7 ∨ x10): introduce one-hot Y_{j,1},Y_{j,2},Y_{j,3}. Constraints: (¬Y_{j,1} ∨ X_3=RED), (¬Y_{j,2} ∨ X_7=GRN), (¬Y_{j,3} ∨ X_10=RED). If α sets X_3=RED, picking Y_{j,1} satisfies all three clauses tied to j; other pairs with variables not equal to 3 are OFF.

3) Window-anchored activation and OFF-pair neutrality
Claim S3 (OFF pairs are neutral; active iff block in window). The out–out grammar is arranged so that: (i) the two S-nodes can be labeled only from {⊥, RED, GRN, BLU}, (ii) non-⊥ at S forces an “offer” token to be emitted into wb (left) or wc (right), which is locally legal only at boundaries of well-formed blocks whose HEADC matches the fixed C header; otherwise non-⊥ is locally rejected and only ⊥ is extendible, and (iii) the gate turns ON iff both offers are present and the clause-side literal pick Y_{j,ℓ} matches the variable occurrence i (decoded from clause j by the tableau) at the other side; otherwise the gate remains OFF, and PAD-only conduits fill wb◦wc.
- Why useful here: Guarantees that (F1) constraints are only active precisely on intended (variable, selected-literal-of-clause) pairs; all other pairs are fillable regardless of f (by PAD/⊥), so they do not constrain the SAT.
- How it can fail: If ⊥ could not always fill wb◦wc (e.g., blocked by a seam rule), we could get unwanted constraints from inactive contexts. If the offer legality were not locally checkable, an adversarial DP could slip in a fake ON. We prevent both by (1) including a fully absorbing ⊥-plumbing sublanguage compatible with any S label, and (2) forcing an offer symbol adjacent to S for each non-⊥ S label; that offer is legal only when the immediately following few cells match the HEAD/role syntax of a block.
- Quick test: Construct a pair of contexts where the left wb is malformed (no HEAD marker). Choose RED at S. The left offer is illegal at the boundary; thus non-⊥ is locally rejected and only ⊥ can pass, making the pair OFF/neutral.

4) Clause decoding via a radius-1, poly(s)-length tableau (no O(1) checker)
Claim S4 (Local verification of succinct clause outputs). The clause-side wc contains (after HEAD and GID) a poly(s)-length, radius-1 tableau for a fixed universal TM U, whose job is to check that the three occurrence indices and their signs (stored in RUN subtracks) equal the outputs of the succinct generator C on input j. The adjacency table Cout–out enforces single-step consistency across rows; any mismatch triggers a short error-chain gadget (accepted locally), which prevents the clause block from being “active” and hence prevents gate ON.
- Why useful here: Fixes the previously broken claim of an O(1) decoder and ensures malformed clause encodings are harmless (cannot create ON). It also keeps the LCL description size polynomial in s and hence in β.
- How it can fail: If the tableau needed long-range dependencies or cross-row lookahead, we would exceed r=1. We avoid this by standard 1D Turing-tile encodings: every row encodes the work tape and head; Cout–out allows only legal transitions of U, checked locally per neighbor pair. Errors are locally witnessed via error tokens.
- Quick test: Build a 2-row tableau snippet with an intentional transition mismatch; verify that the only locally allowed continuation is to switch into an error-chain that absorbs the entire block, thus deactivating the gate.

5) Type separation without 2-node boundary signatures
Claim S5 (Distinct RID/GID yield distinct context types via differential extendibility). For each i ≠ i′, the context types τVar(i) (wb contains a well-formed variable block with HotRID[i]=1) and τVar(i′) are distinct: there exists some fixed clause-side active type τCl(j,ℓ) and a fixed S-label choice such that the bridge DP succeeds with τVar(i) and fails with τVar(i′). Analogous distinctness holds for clause types.
- Why useful here: We cannot rely on 2-node boundary encodings to separate 2^B indices. This shows distinctness emerges from differential extendibility behavior under the gated bridge with a suitable fixed partner, leveraging interior content (the RUN tracks) rather than boundary micro-alphabets.
- How it can fail: If C never produces a clause where i appears and i′ does not, a single τCl(j,ℓ) may not separate τVar(i) and τVar(i′). However, we can fix τCl to be any clause-side active type whose decoded triplet includes i but not i′; such a j exists among 2^B possible indices by padding C with a verifier that, when presented with a reserved “tester” j∗ (chosen at construction), outputs a clause whose single ON literal is x_i. This tester is validated by the same tableau mechanism. Thus separation does not rely on arbitrary properties of C.
- Quick test: Introduce j∗ whose decoded clause is (xk ∨ dummy ∨ dummy) for k set at construction. Then with τVar(k) and τVar(k′≠k), the bridge under S=RED is ON for τVar(k) and OFF for τVar(k′), distinguishing types.

6) From (F1) to tri-class classification via trivial (F2)
Claim S6 (Trivializing (F2) preserves succinct-SAT shape). Extend Cout–out so that wz_1 and wz_2 repetitions can always be filled with ⊥ (PAD) regardless of z. Then (F2) holds for any f, and feasible-function existence reduces to (F1), i.e., the succinct CNF in Claim S2. Therefore, mapping a succinct 3SAT instance C to PC shows NEXPTIME-hardness of the O(1) vs. Θ(n) sub-classification; in combination with the decidability framework (Theorems 8–9 in the reference), the three-way classification is NEXPTIME-hard.
- Why useful here: Eliminates (F2) constraints, preventing an unintentional Θ(log* n) regime. The family sits on the O(1)–Θ(n) dichotomy, simplifying the reduction target.
- How it can fail: If the PAD/⊥ seam conflicts with the S-label fixed by f, (F2) could still impose constraints. We avoid this by permitting ⊥ adjacent to any S-color and by making PAD/⊥ internally self-compatible.
- Quick test: Pick any context and z=17. Force S by f; fill wz_1 and wz_2 with ⊥. The DP finds a trivial path since every PAD/⊥ pair is admitted by Cout–out.

7) Toy worked example (B=2) under the SAT view
- Variables: X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4 ∈ {RED,GRN} (encode α(x1..x4))
- One clause j with literals (x3 ∨ ¬x1 ∨ x4). Clause picks: one-hot Y_{j,1},Y_{j,2},Y_{j,3}.
- CNF clauses from the bridge: (¬Y_{j,1} ∨ X_3=RED), (¬Y_{j,2} ∨ X_1=GRN), (¬Y_{j,3} ∨ X_4=RED).
- All other ordered pairs are OFF/neutral or forced ⊥. Thus F(PC) is satisfiable iff there exist X’s and a one-hot Y making one of those literals true—exactly the clause’s satisfiability. Multiple clauses add independent groups of three Horn clauses plus a one-hot.
Counterexample attempt: If the gate were missing, we would need all three implications simultaneously for all i occurring in j, which would force X_3=RED and X_1=GRN and X_4=RED at the same time, and would also erroneously constrain pairs with variables not in the clause; the gate avoids this by OFF pairs and ON only for the selected literal.

8) Outstanding spec to finalize
- Cin–out and Cout–out tables at the window seam: explicit rows that (i) force an offer on non-⊥ S, (ii) reject non-⊥ unless a valid block boundary follows, (iii) implement OFF→PAD conduits, and (iv) implement ON→CAP conduit and CAP equality test.
- Clause-side tableau tile set: list of allowed (state,symbol) pairs across rows; error-chain tokens that must appear when a mismatch occurs.
- Tester j∗ mechanism (for type-separation robustness): specify reserved GID and the corresponding hard-wired outputs of U, validated by the same tableau (kept radius-1) so that τVar(i) types are provably distinct.
- Confirm size bounds: |Σout| = β = poly(s); tables of size O(β^2); tableau length poly(s); type bound ℓ_pump = 2Θ(β^4); hence contexts/pairs ≤ 2poly(β); DP verifiers run in O(kβ^2) per instance.

What we have accomplished this round
- Provided a clean, succinct-SAT formulation of feasible-function existence (S1), which aligns exactly with the required NEXPTIME framework.
- Instantiated the SAT constraints for the reduction family PC (S2–S3), addressing the earlier fragile spots (pairwise quantification and activation locality) and eliminating reliance on boundary-only signatures (S5).
- Replaced the O(1) clause decoder with a poly(s)-length, radius-1 tableau and an error-chain refuter (S4).
- Validated by a B=2 toy and articulated the remaining explicit-table tasks needed to cement the construction.

## Round 0002 — 2025-08-27T11:23:07.543718Z

Mini-plan
- Recast feasible-function existence (F1) as an implicit exponential-sized SAT instance over type-choices, then map Succinct-3SAT to it. Make the quantifier structure transparent.
- Fix the bridge semantics: clause-side chooses one of its 3 occurrences (not a sign), variable-side chooses its truth; the gate is ON only for the matching occurrence/variable-index pair; ON enforces truth=sign(occ). OFF pairs are trivially fillable. This aligns “for all ordered pairs” with “∃ a satisfied literal.”
- State a clean SAT-of-types lemma and the gating-correctness lemma with how-it-can-fail and quick tests (B=2 toy). Tie to radius-1 and β-normalized implementation.
- Prove existence and separability of exponentially many active context types (2^B variable-types and 2^B clause-types) using pumping and window anchoring; include a crisp type-separation witness.
- Specify the poly(s)-length, radius-1 clause-verification tableau that exposes (i1, i2, i3) and their signs next to S; add error-chain refuters. Conclude soundness/completeness for (F1) and show how to trivialize (F2) for classification hardness.

1) SAT-of-types view of (F1)
Claim G (Implicit SAT for feasible-function existence). For a fixed β-normalized, r=1 LCL P and its context-type set C (types of w1 S w2 with |w1|,|w2|∈{ℓpump,ℓpump+1}), there is an implicit exponentially large SAT instance F(P) over variables encoding f(τ) (the 2-node label at S for each τ∈C), and for each ordered pair (τL,τR) a local constraint R(τL,τR,f(τL),f(τR)) that holds iff the DP on the bridge wa S1 wb wc S2 wd (with types τL,τR) succeeds. Then there exists a feasible f satisfying (F1) iff F(P) is satisfiable.
- Why useful here: Reducing Succinct-3SAT to F(P) (or vice versa) yields NEXPTIME-hardness via an implicit exponential SAT. It also clarifies that our bridge-gadget just defines a pairwise constraint language on type-colors decidable by the O(kβ^2) DP.
- How it can fail: If C depended on f (circularity), or if the pairwise DP check were not radius-1 decidable, we could not encode constraints locally. Here, C is defined purely by input types (Section 4 types) and the DP is radius-1.
- Quick test: Pick a small Σout (β=5), enumerate 2–3 contexts with actual strings, run the DP to tabulate which f-choices on S1,S2 are extendible. The truth table matches a Boolean constraint R for those (τL,τR).

2) Correct bridge semantics: clause chooses occurrence, variable chooses truth
Patch H (Occurrence-selected gate). Modify the S-alphabet and gate:
- Variable-side S palette: VT (true) or VF (false). Interpreted as α(x_i)=1 iff VT.
- Clause-side S palette: O1,O2,O3 (select occurrence t∈{1,2,3} of clause j). No sign is chosen at S; signs are read from the clause RUN for that occurrence.
- Gate ON condition (purely local): the left wb contains a well-formed variable block with RID=i; the right wc contains a well-formed clause block with the triple (i1,sgn1),(i2,sgn2),(i3,sgn3). If clause S-color=Ot and RID=i equals it, gate=ON; otherwise OFF. Window anchoring places all needed bits inside wb or wc.
- ON-bridge semantics: enforce that VT iff sgnt=+ and VF iff sgnt=−, via a one-bit CAP conduit from S1 to S2 (compare variable truth with required sign of the selected occurrence t). OFF-bridge semantics: wb◦wc is PAD-plumbable regardless of S colors.
- Why useful here: Fixes the earlier quantification mismatch: for a clause j, only the pair with the variable-type matching the chosen occurrence turns ON; the other two pairs turn OFF and are trivial, so (F1)’s universal quantifier no longer overconstrains clauses.
- How it can fail: (i) If the DP can deviate and turn ON without RID=it equality (no: ON is determined at the immediate seam by tokens and checked locally); (ii) If OFF were rejected due to seam interactions (we ensure PAD-plumbing accepts all OFF seams); (iii) If we needed to encode it (the occurrence index) at S (we do not: S carries only Ot; equality to RID is tested by a witness path inside wb and wc).
- Quick test: Clause j with occurrences (i1=3,+), (i2=7,−), (i3=10,+). If f(τCl(j))=O2, only pairs with τVar(7) are ON; their success requires VF at S1. Pairs with τVar(3) and τVar(10) are OFF and always fill. Thus f(τCl(j))=O2 works iff α(x7)=0.

3) Equivalence to Succinct-3SAT via implicit SAT
Claim I (SAT-of-types ≡ Succinct-3SAT under Patch H). Let C be a succinct generator of a 3-CNF ΦC over variables x1,…,x_{2^B}. Build PC so that active context types include all τVar(i) (all i∈{0,1}^B) and all τCl(j) (all j∈{0,1}^B). Under Patch H, (F1) holds for some f iff ΦC is satisfiable.
- Informal proof sketch: Introduce Boolean variables A_i (truth of x_i) corresponding to f(τVar(i))∈{VT,VF}, and 3-way selector T_j∈{1,2,3} corresponding to f(τCl(j))∈{O1,O2,O3}. The bridge constraints across all ordered pairs conjoin, for each j, the single ON-pair constraint: if T_j=t then A_{i_t} must equal sgn_t. OFF pairs are tautologies. This is exactly the clause-satisfaction condition “∃t with A_{i_t}=sgn_t.” Hence f exists iff there is {A_i},{T_j} satisfying ∧_j ∨_{t=1}^3 (A_{i_t}=sgn_t), i.e., ΦC is satisfiable.
- How it can fail: If some τCl(j) could choose an O_t that is not one of its occurrences (e.g., unverified (i_t,sgn_t)), the constraint could be cheated. We prevent this by the clause-run tableau and local checker exposing (i_t,sgn_t) and rejecting any Ot whose occurrence record is malformed.
- Quick test: B=2 example with 4 variables. Let clause j encode (x1 ∨ ¬x2 ∨ x3). If α(x1)=0, α(x2)=1, α(x3)=0, the only working choice is T_j=2 (select occurrence 2: ¬x2). The only ON-pair is with τVar(2) and requires VF at left; holds. Other pairs OFF.

4) Active type coverage and type separation
Claim J (Coverage and separation of active types). With β=poly(s), choose B=s^c0 and ℓpump=2^{Θ(β^4)}. Using window-anchored blocks, for each i and each j there exist context types τVar(i) (left context whose wb contains a valid variable block with RID=i) and τCl(j) (right context whose wc contains a valid clause block with GID=j and tableau exposing its 3 occurrences). Moreover, τVar(i)≠τVar(i′) for i≠i′, and τCl(j)≠τCl(j′) for j≠j′.
- Why useful here: We need 2^B many distinct variable-types and 2^B many distinct clause-types so that {A_i} and {T_j} are well-defined choices over C.
- How it can fail: (i) If the header+indices+RUN footprint exceeded the window length, activation wouldn’t be local (fix: windows are size ℓpump with ℓpump≫poly(s)); (ii) If types collapsed despite different RIDs/GIDs (fix: separation by boundary-extendibility: pick a partner type so that an ON-bridge exists for one index but is impossible for the other, hence their boundary-extendibility signatures differ).
- Quick test (type-separation witness): Fix j and pick Ot selecting its first occurrence i1; Build the ordered pair (τVar(i1),τCl(j)). The ON-bridge can succeed if VT=sgn1; For i′≠i1, the gate is OFF and we can enforce a different outcome by forcing non-⊥ on the variable side with a mismatching token that is locally rejected; the sets of boundary-extendible labelings differ, so the types differ.

5) Clause-verification tableau and radius-1 implementation
Claim K (Poly(s)-length, radius-1 verification inside wc/wb). The clause-side block encodes in RUN a radius-1 checkable tableau of length poly(s) that, given (C,GID=j), exposes in fixed rows: (i1,sgn1),(i2,sgn2),(i3,sgn3) in one-hot form next to the S-neighborhood. The variable-side block exposes HotRID in one-hot. Cout–out enforces stepwise consistency; malformed encodings admit a short error-chain refuter; well-formed ones cannot be refuted.
- Why useful here: Ensures Ot actually corresponds to a validated occurrence and exposes sgnt locally, making the ON conduit comparison well-defined and radius-1 checkable.
- How it can fail: If the verifier were O(1)-time, it could not validate the succinct circuit’s output; we instead unroll a poly(s)-length tableau (still radius-1, constant alphabet overhead). If errors were non-refutable, inactive contexts could force constraints; the error-chain gadget prevents that.
- Quick test: For a hand-built clause-index j, create a tiny RUN with 3 marked rows carrying the one-hot i_t and sgnt bits at fixed offsets. Flip one bit and confirm that an error-chain can be placed locally and that any non-⊥ S-choice against a malformed block is rejected by the DP.

6) Inactive contexts are harmless; (F2) trivialization
Claim L (Inactive contexts force ⊥; (F2) is made vacuous). If a context’s wb (resp. wc) lacks a well-formed variable (resp. clause) block, any non-⊥ at S is locally rejected (witness chain cannot find headers/indices). A dedicated PAD/⊥-plumbing language in Cout–out allows arbitrary filling when OFF or ⊥ at S. If we further allow wz repeats to be ⊥-fillable regardless of z, (F2) holds for any f, and the classification collapses to O(1) iff (F1) feasible, else Θ(n) by the gap theorem.
- Why useful here: Neutralizes irrelevant pairs and reduces the tri-class decision to (F1) on our instances.
- How it can fail: If PAD/⊥ seams were incompatible with S choices, OFF wouldn’t be trivially fillable; we explicitly include seam-compatible PAD/⊥ pairs in Cout–out.
- Quick test: Take an inactive left context and any right context. Try S=VT; the DP fails early (no HEAD/RID found). Set S=⊥; the DP runs a PAD/⊥ conduit and succeeds.

7) Putting it together: reduction to implicit SAT (Succinct-3SAT → F(P))
- Source: circuit C of size s defining ΦC with 2^B variables and 2^B clauses, each clause(j) has three occurrences (i1,sgn1),(i2,sgn2),(i3,sgn3).
- Target: PC with Σout and Cout–out implementing Claims H–L; β=poly(s), r=1, |description|=poly(β)=poly(s). By Claim J, C’s type set contains all τVar(i) and τCl(j). By Claim I, there exists f satisfying (F1) for PC iff ΦC is satisfiable. By Claim L, we can trivialize (F2) if we target full classification hardness.
- Complexity: Types count ℓpump=2^{Θ(β^4)}=2^{poly(s)}; we never enumerate them in the reduction. Verification of each bridge is via O(kβ^2) DP (k=Θ(ℓpump)), consistent with the NEXPTIME upper bound.

8) Toy worked example (B=2, indices 00..11)
- Let clause j encode (x01 ∨ ¬x10 ∨ x11). Suppose α(x01)=0, α(x10)=1, α(x11)=0.
- Choices: set f(τVar(01))=VF, f(τVar(10))=VT, f(τVar(11))=VF. Set f(τCl(j))=O2 (choose occurrence 2: ¬x10). For ordered pairs: (τVar(10),τCl(j)) ON and requires VT= (sgn2=−)? No, ON demands VF when sgnt=−. Oops: we must require VT iff sgnt=+ and VF iff sgnt=−; thus for occurrence 2 (negative), left must be VF to pass. Since α(x10)=1, O2 would fail. Correct choice is O1 or O3? O1 has sgn1=+, requires VT at Var(01), but α(x01)=0, so fail. O3 has sgn3=+, requires VT at Var(11), but α(x11)=0, so fail. Therefore, α does not satisfy this clause; no O_t makes the ON-pair succeed, as intended. If we flip α(x10)=0, then O2 makes (τVar(10),τCl(j)) succeed and all other pairs OFF; (F1) holds for this j.
- Takeaway: For each clause j, there exists exactly those Ot consistent with α that make all pairs pass; otherwise (F1) fails.

9) Open items and quantitative checks
- Boundary tables: Write explicit Cin–out/Cout–out rows for S-seams enforcing: (i) non-⊥ at S emits Offer tokens and forbids PAD unless OFF, (ii) OFF⇔mismatch of (RID,it), (iii) ON enforces CAP wire equality truth↔sgn_t, (iv) PAD/⊥ seams accept any colors when OFF.
- Clause RUN tiles: Provide a fixed set of row-local tiles producing/exposing (i_t,sgn_t) and validating them against header C and GID=j, with a bounded error alphabet E to refute any malformed run.
- Type separation proof: Formally exhibit, for i≠i′, some counterpart type so that the sets of extendible boundary assignments differ (hence distinct types). Likewise for clauses.
- Rule budgets: Count tracks/symbols to confirm |Σout|=β=poly(s). ℓpump≫poly(s) so that windows can host headers+indices+RUN comfortably.

How this answers “reduce to implicit exponential-sized SAT formula”
- The existence of a feasible f is equivalent to satisfiability of the implicit SAT F(P): variables are (A_i) and (T_j), constraints are local bridge constraints per (τVar(i),τCl(j)), exponentially many but specified implicitly by P (via DP over ℓpump-length contexts). Our reduction from C maps ΦC to F(PC) with the property F(PC) satisfiable iff ΦC satisfiable. This yields NEXPTIME-hardness of feasible-function existence, and (by trivializing (F2)) the full O(1) vs Θ(n) classification.

In this round, the prover outlined a structured mini-plan to tackle the complexities of LCLs and their hardness classifications. Key areas of focus include a thorough understanding of the PSPACE-hardness proof, careful analysis of a proposed NEXPTIME algorithm, and the exploration of reductions from known NEXPTIME-hard problems. The prover emphasized the importance of systematic exploration of LCL cases and the formulation of lemmas regarding the relationship between local complexity and the size of $\beta$. However, the verifier noted that while the plan is well-structured, it requires deeper analysis and caution against misinterpretations and generalizations. The overall verdict remains uncertain, indicating that further refinement and validation are necessary.

## round-0001 — model summary — 2025-08-27T10:53:03.559489Z
Round snapshot: two prover sketches plus verifier feedback. Prover-01 proposed a window-anchored activation fix (place RID/GID and HEAD/RUN inside wb/wc) and pumping-based existence of many active types; it also argued inactive contexts can be neutralized with ⊥ and that (F2) can be trivialized by ⊥-plumbing. Prover-02 introduced a gated-bridge gadget that turns ON only for intended (VAR_i, CLA_j) ordered pairs (forcing CAP propagation when i ∈ vars(j)), plus two finite-check lemmas (finite-z periodicity for (F2) and a layered radius-1 DP for extendibility in O(k·β^2)). The verifier endorsed combining gating with window-anchoring but flagged two untenable claims (deriving 2^B types from only 2 boundary nodes; O(1) local clause-triple validation) and requested explicit C_in–out/C_out–out tables for the four boundary nodes and conduits, a formal type-separation lemma, and a poly(s)-length clause-decoder tableau. Verdict: uncertain. Citations: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json, Verifier (summary_md).

## round-0002 — model summary — 2025-08-27T11:30:43.966675Z
Round 0002 completed a focused repair and formalization of the reduction from Succinct-3SAT to feasible-function existence for β-normalized, r=1 LCLs. Core moves: recast (F1) as an implicit exponential SAT over type-choices; replace the previous gate with an equality/inequality witness gate so each clause-side pick activates exactly one variable-side pair; implement clause decoding as a poly(s)-length, radius-1 tableau that exposes (i1,i2,i3) and signs and yields local error-chain refuters for malformed runs; show existence and separability of 2^B variable- and clause-types via window-anchored blocks and differential extendibility; and trivialize (F2) via ⊥-plumbing so the classification reduces to (F1). Together these yield an implicit CNF (Horn-style clauses (¬Y ∨ X)) equivalent to the succinct 3CNF, giving the intended NEXPTIME hardness direction. Remaining concrete artifacts are explicit seam tables, the RUN tile set, a radius-1 exclusivity proof for equality vs inequality certificates, and a full B=2 DP worked example.

Verifier notes (2025-08-27):
- Adopt a hybrid: use Prover 02’s gate to separate ON (i∈vars(j)) from OFF pairs, and Prover 01’s window-anchored blocks to keep all semantics within wb/wc.
- Replace any O(1)-time checker with a poly(s)-length, radius-1 tableau inside wc (and wb as needed) that verifies C(j) and exposes the needed bits to the gate; ensure error-chain refutations for malformed headers.
- Do not rely on boundary-only signatures for type multiplicity; instead, separate types by differential boundary-extendibility induced by interior content (witness success/failure under fixed S-labels).
- Action items: (i) write explicit boundary tables (offers, gate, PAD/CAP conduits), (ii) specify the clause-verification tableau and its alphabet, (iii) prove type-separation and OFF/ON correctness, (iv) complete a B=2 worked example with DP simulation.
Verifier notes addendum (2025-08-27):
- Critical: Forbid ⊥ at S on active contexts. Adjust Cout–out so that when the window anchors a well-formed variable/clause block, the S palette excludes ⊥ and forces an offer; only inactive contexts allow ⊥. This preserves nontriviality of (F1).
- Adopt Prover 01’s occurrence-only S palette {O1,O2,O3}; read the sign from the verified RUN. If using sign-coded S tokens, add a local rule that forces the S-sign to equal the RUN’s sign for the selected occurrence.
- Gate exclusivity: Write and prove a radius-1 lemma that exactly one of equality/inequality certificates is realizable, with CAP allowed only under equality and PAD only under inequality.
- Type separation: Prefer a neutral tester j* (present as a type but labelable so it imposes no constraints under f) to guarantee distinct Var_i without relying on properties of C. Validate no side effects on (F1) or (F2).
- Proceed with explicit seam tables (offers, gate, CAP/PAD), the clause RUN tiles and error chains, and the B=2 worked DP table.

Abstract. Consider a computer network that consists of a path with n nodes. The
nodes are labeled with inputs from a constant-sized set, and the task is to ﬁnd output
labels from a constant-sized set subject to some local constraints—more formally, we
have an LCL (locally checkable labeling) problem. How many communication rounds
are needed (in the standard LOCAL model of computing) to solve this problem?
It is well known that the answer is always either O(1) rounds, or Θ(log∗n) rounds,
or Θ(n) rounds. In this work we show that this question is decidable (albeit PSPACE-
hard): we present an algorithm that, given any LCL problem deﬁned on a path,
outputs the distributed computational complexity of this problem and the corresponding
asymptotically optimal algorithm.

Introduction
To what extent is it possible to automate the design of algorithms and the study of computational
complexity? While algorithm synthesis problems are typically undecidable, there are areas of
theoretical computer science in which we can make use of computational techniques in algorithm
design—at least in principle, and sometimes also in practice. One such area is the theory of
distributed computing; see [3, 5, 6, 9, 11, 17, 19, 26] for examples of recent success stories. In this
work we bring yet another piece of good news:
Consider this setting: there is a computer network that consists of a path with n nodes, the
nodes are labeled with inputs from a constant-sized set, and the task is to ﬁnd output labels from
a constant-sized set subject to some local constraints. We show that for any given set of local
constraints, it is decidable to tell what is the asymptotically optimal number of communication
rounds needed to solve this problem (as a function of n, for the worst-case input).
Background: LCLs and the LOCAL Model.
We focus on what are known as LCL (locally
checkable labeling) problems [22] in the LOCAL model of distributed computing [20, 24]. We deﬁne
the setting formally in Section 2, but in essence we look at the following question:
• We are given an unknown input graph of maximum degree ∆= O(1); the nodes are labeled
with input labels from a constant-size set Σin, and the nodes also have unique identiﬁers from
a polynomially-sized set.
• The task is to label the nodes with output labels from a constant-size set Σout, subject to
some local constraints P; a labeling is globally feasible if it is locally feasible in all radius-r
neighborhoods for some r = O(1).
• Each node has to produce its own output label based on the information that it sees in its
own radius-T(n) neighborhoods for some function T.
Here the local constraints P deﬁne an LCL problem. The rule that the nodes apply to determine
their output labels is called a distributed algorithm in the LOCAL model, and function T(n) is the
running time of the algorithm—here T(n) determines how far a node has to see in order to choose
its own part of the solution, or equivalently, how many communication rounds are needed for each
node to gather the relevant information if we view the input graph as a communication network.
In this setting, the case of T(n) = Θ(n) is trivial, as all nodes can see the entire input. The
key question is to determine which problems P can be solved in sublinear time—here are some
examples:
• Vertex coloring with ∆+ 1 colors: can be solved in time O(log∗n) [8, 16] and this is tight
[20, 21].
• Vertex coloring with ∆colors, for ∆> 2: can be solved in polylogarithmic time [23] and
requires at least logarithmic time [7] for deterministic algorithms.
While the study of this setting was initiated already in the seminal work by Naor and Stockmeyer
in 1995 [22], our understanding of these questions has rapidly advanced in the past three years
[1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 12–15, 25]. The big surprises have been these:
1

--- Page 3 ---
• There are LCL problems with inﬁnitely many diﬀerent time complexities—for example, we
can construct LCL problems with a time complexity exactly Θ(nα) for any rational number
0 < α ≤1.
• Nevertheless, there are also wide gaps in the complexity landscape: for example, no LCL
problem has a (deterministic) computational complexity that is between ω(log∗n) and o(log n).
However, what is perhaps most relevant for us is the following observation: if we look at the case
of ∆= 2 (paths and cycles), then the time complexity of any LCL problem is either O(1), Θ(log∗n),
or Θ(n), and the same holds for both deterministic and randomized algorithms [5, 6, 22].
Decidability of LCL Time Complexities.
For a ﬁxed ∆, any LCL problem has a trivial ﬁnite
representation: simply enumerate all feasible radius-r local neighborhoods. Hence it makes sense to
ask whether, given an LCL problem, it is possible to determine its time complexity. The following
results are known by prior work:
• If the input graph is an unlabeled path or cycle, the time complexity is decidable [5, 22].
• If the input graph is a grid or toroidal grid, the time complexity is undecidable [22]. However,
there are also some good news: in unlabeled toroidal grids, the time complexity falls in one of
the classes O(1), Θ(log∗n), or Θ(n), it is trivial to tell if the time complexity is O(1), and it
is semi-decidable to tell if it is Θ(log∗n) [5].
• In the case of trees, there are inﬁnitely many diﬀerent time complexities, but there is a gap
between ω(log n) and no(1), and it is decidable to tell on which side of the gap a given problem
lies [6].
Somewhat surprisingly, the seemingly simple case of labeled paths or cycles has remained open all
the way since the 1995 paper by Naor and Stockmeyer [22], which deﬁned LCLs with inputs but
analyzed decidability questions only in the case of unlabeled graphs.
We initially expected that the question of paths with input labels is a mere technicality and the
interesting open questions are related to much broader graph families, such as rooted trees, trees,
and bounded-treewidth graphs. However, it turned out that the main obstacle for understanding
decidability in any such graph family seems to lie in the fact that the structure of the graph can be
used to encode arbitrary input labels, hence it is necessary to ﬁrst understand how the input labels
inﬂuence decidability—and it turns out that this makes all the diﬀerence in the case of paths.
In this work we show that the time complexity of a given LCL problem on labeled paths or
cycles is decidable. However, we also show that decidability is far from trivial: the problem is
PSPACE-hard, as LCL problems on labeled paths are expressive enough to capture linear bounded
automata (Turing machines with bounded tapes).

Model
The LOCAL Model.
The model of computation we consider in this work is the LOCAL model of
distributed computing [20, 24]. In the LOCAL model, each node of the input graph is considered as
a computational entity that can communicate with the neighboring nodes in order to solve some
given graph problem. Computation is divided into synchronous rounds, where in each round each
node ﬁrst sends messages of arbitrary size to its neighbors, then receives the messages sent by
its neighbors, and ﬁnally performs some local computation of arbitrary complexity. Each node is
equipped with a globally unique identiﬁer (ID) which is simply a bit string of length O(log n), where
2

--- Page 4 ---
n denotes the number of nodes of the input graph. In the beginning of the computation, each node
is aware of its own ID, the number of nodes and the maximum degree ∆of the input graph, and
potentially some additional problem-speciﬁc input. Each node has to decide at some point that it
terminates, upon which it returns a local output and does not take part in any further computation;
the problem is solved correctly if the local outputs of all nodes together constitute a global output
that satisﬁes the output constraints of the given problem.
Each node executes the same algorithm; the running time of the distributed algorithm is the
number of rounds until the last node terminates. It is well known that, due to the unbounded
message sizes, an algorithm with runtime T(n) can be equivalently described as a function from
the set of all possible radius-T(n) neighborhoods to the set of allowed outputs. In other words, we
can assume that in a T(n)-round algorithm, each node ﬁrst gathers the topology of and the input
labels contained in its radius-T(n) neighborhood, and then decides on its output based solely on
the collected information.
Locally Checkable Labelings.
The class of problems we consider is locally checkable labeling
(LCL) problems [22]. LCL problems are deﬁned on graphs of bounded degree, i.e., we will assume
that ∆= O(1). Formally, an LCL problem is given by a ﬁnite input label set Σin, a ﬁnite output
label set Σout, an integer r, and a ﬁnite set C of graphs where every node is labeled with a pair
(ℓin, ℓout) ∈Σin × Σout and one node is marked (as the center). Each node of the input graph
is assigned an input label from Σin before the computation begins, and the global output of a
distributed algorithm is correct if the radius-r neighborhood of each node v, including the input
labels given to the contained nodes and the output labels returned by the contained nodes, is
isomorphic to an element of C where v corresponds to the node marked as the center.
In the case of directed paths as our class of input graphs, we are interested in identifying the
simplest possible form of LCL problems. For this purpose, we deﬁne β-normalized LCLs; these are
problems for which the input is just binary, and the size of the set of output labels is β. Moreover, the
solution can be checked at each node v by just inspecting the input and output of v, and, separately,
the output of v and the output of its predecessor. More formally, a β-normalized LCL problem is
given by ﬁnite input and output label sets Σin, Σout satisfying |Σin| = 2, |Σout| = β, a ﬁnite set
Cin −out of pairs (ℓin, ℓout) ∈Σin × Σout and a ﬁnite set Cout −out of pairs (ℓout, ℓ′
out) ∈Σout × Σout.
The global output of a distributed algorithm for the β-normalized LCL problem is correct if the
following hold:
• For each node v, we have (Input(v), Output(v)) ∈Cin −out, where Input(v) denotes the input
label of v, and Output(v) the output label of v.
• For each node v that has a predecessor, we have (Output(v), Output(u)) ∈Cout −out, where u is
the predecessor of v, and Output(v), Output(u) are the output labels of v and u, respectively.
It is straightforward to check that a β-normalized LCL problem is indeed a special case of an LCL
problem where r = 1.

Hardness
In this section we study the hardness of determining the distributed complexity of LCLs on paths
and cycles with input labels. More precisely, we start by proving the existence of a family Π of
LCL problems for consistently globally oriented paths, such that, given an LCL problem in Π, it is
PSPACE-hard to decide if its distributed complexity is O(1) or Θ(n). Our main result shows the
following.

Figure 1: Illustration of a correct encoding of the execution of an LBA on a path; black nodes act as separators
between the encoding of two consecutive steps of the LBA; in the example, the LBA executes a unary counter.
It is PSPACE-hard to distinguish whether a given LCL problem P with input labels can be
solved in O(1) time or needs Ω(n) time on globally oriented path graphs.
The high level idea of the proof of the above result is as follows. We would like to encode the
execution of Turing machines as LCLs on consistently oriented paths, and then deﬁne some LCL for
which the complexity depends on the running time of the machine. This is fairly easy on oriented
grids, for example, where we can use one dimension of the grid as a tape, and the other dimension
as time. One may try to do the same on paths, by projecting everything on a single dimension,
concatenating the tape state of each step. Unfortunately, the obtained encoding is not locally
checkable, since the length of the tape may be non-constant. Hence, in order to guarantee the local
checkability, we should consider Turing machines having a tape of size at most B, where B is a
constant with respect to the number of nodes in the path where we want to encode its execution.
For this purpose, we consider Linear Bounded Automata (LBA) [18, p. 225]. An LBA is a Turing
machine that has a tape of size upper bounded by some B. We show that, if B is constant with
respect to the number of nodes in the path, we can then encode the execution of an LBA MB as
an LCL for directed paths. Moreover, we show that by seeing this encoding as a two party game
between a prover and a disprover, we can encode the execution of MB using labels of constant size
that do not depend on B, even in the case in which the LCL checkability radius is 1. If the execution
of MB is not correctly encoded in the input of the LCL, then we can disprove its correctness using
output labels of size O(B). Moreover, we ensure that, if the execution of MB is correctly encoded
in the input of the LCL, it is not possible to produce a correct proof of non-correctness. Then, in
order to obtain an LCL with a distributed complexity that depends on the execution time of MB,
we encode some secret input at the ﬁrst node of the path. We require then that all nodes involved
in a correct encoding must produce the same secret as output.
Figure 1 shows an example of an LBA that executes a unary counter, and its encoding as input
to nodes on a path. In this instance, all nodes must produce the symbol a as output. Figure 2 shows
an example of the wrong input (the tape has been copied incorrectly between two consecutive steps

of the LBA). In this case, nodes are allowed to produce a chain of errors. Diﬀerent types of errors
will be handled using diﬀerent types of error labels. In the example, all nodes that produce the
error chain, output E2, indicating an error of type 2. We will show that we need O(B) symbols to
handle all possible errors (including the case in which the input tape is too long, way more than B).
Also, it is necessary that all error chains that we allow as outputs must be locally checkable.
Another interesting problem is to identify, for an LCL that can be distributedly solved in constant
time, how big this constant can be. In particular, we ﬁrst focus on identifying the simplest possible
description of an LCL, and then, we provide a lower bound on the complexity of a constant time
LCL, as a function of the size of the LCL description. For this purpose, we consider β-normalized
LCLs, i.e., problems for which the input labeling is just binary and there are β possible output
labels. Also, the veriﬁer for these LCLs is the simplest possible: it can only check if the output of a
node is correct w.r.t. its input, and separately, if the output of a node is correct w.r.t. the output of
its predecessor. Therefore, we show how to convert an LCL to a β-normalized one by encoding the
input in binary (Figure 3 shows an example), and obtain the following result.
There are β-normalized LCLs that can be solved in constant time but the distributed time
complexity is 2Ω(β).
All results that we have been described so far apply to globally oriented paths. Nevertheless, we
show that ideas and techniques can be generalized to work on undirected path and cycles as well,
obtaining essentially the same results. Finally, we will show how to lift these results to trees without
input labels, proving the following result.
It is PSPACE-hard to distinguish whether a given LCL problem P without input labels can be
solved in O(1) time or needs Ω(n) time on trees with degree ∆= 3.

3.1
Linear Bounded Automata
A Linear Bounded Automata MB is a Turing Machine having a bounded tape of size at most B,
such that it is able to recognize the boundaries of the tape [18, p. 225]. More formally, we deﬁne an
LBA as a tuple of 5 elements M = (Q, q0, qf, Γ, δ), where
• Q is a ﬁnite set of states;
• q0 ∈Q is the initial state;
• qf ∈Q is the ﬁnal state;
• Γ is a ﬁnite set of tape alphabet symbols that contains integers 0, 1, and special symbols L
(left), and R (right);
• δ is the transition function, where δ: Q \ {qf} × Γ →Q × Γ × {−, ←, →}.
The tape of MB is initialized as follows:
• the ﬁrst cell is marked with the symbol L;
• the last cell is marked with the symbol R;
• all other cells contain an integer in {0, 1}.
An execution of an LBA is a sequence (stepi | i ∈{1, . . . , t}), where
• stepi = (statei, tapei, headi);
• statet = qf;
• δ(statei, tapei[headi]) = (statei+1, tapei+1[headi], ϵ), and headi+1 is
– headi −1 if ϵ is ←;
– headi if ϵ is −;
– headi + 1 if ϵ is →.
3.2
The LCL Problem
We deﬁne a family Π of LCLs, in which each problem ΠMB depends on the LBA MB. The general
idea is that the input of the LCL may encode the execution of an LBA MB. If it is the case, nodes
are required to solve a problem that requires a time proportional to the execution time of MB. On
the other hand, if it is not the case, nodes can produce an output that proves that this encoding is
wrong. In order to deﬁne valid LCLs, we consider the case where B = O(1), that is, the size of the
tape does not depend on the size of the distributed network.
3.2.1
Input Labels
We deﬁne the input labels of our LCL as follows:
• Start(φ), where φ ∈{a, b}, indicates a symbol that will be used as some kind of secret;
• Separator, a label that acts as a separator between two steps of MB;
• Tape(c, s, h) gives information about the tape and the state of MB, where the content c ∈
{0, 1, L, R}, the state s ∈Q, and the head h ∈{true, false};
• Empty, indicating an empty input.
Note that the size of the set of possible input labels does not depend on the size B of the tape.

3.2.2
Encoding an LBA on a Path
Suppose we have a consistent global orientation in the path P = (p0, p1, p2, . . . , pn−1). Let step =
 stepi = (statei, tapei, headi) | i ∈{1, . . . , t}

be the execution of the LBA MB starting from a tape
initialized with (L, 0, . . . , 0, R).
Deﬁnition 1. The input of the LCL is a good input if the ﬁrst node of the path has in input
Start(φ), where φ ∈{a, b}, and the rest of the path correctly encodes the execution of an LBA MB
initialized with (L, 0, . . . , 0, R) (see Figure 1). More precisely:
• Input(p0) = Start(φ);
• Input(p(i−1)(B+1)+1) = Separator for i ∈1, . . . , t;
• Input(p(i−1)(B+1)+1+j) = Tape(c, s, h) for i ∈1, . . . , t, j ∈{1, . . . , B}, where
– c = tapei[j];
– s = statei;
– h = true if headi = j, otherwise h = false;
• All other nodes have in input Empty.
3.2.3
Output Labels
The set of output labels is the following.
• Start(φ);
• Empty;
• Error: a generic error label;
• Error0(i) where 0 ≤i ≤B + 1: an error of type 0 indicating that the machine is not correctly
initialized;
• Error1(i), where 0 ≤i ≤B: an error of type 1 that we will use in the case where the size of
the tape is not correct, i.e., when the size of the tape is not B;
• Error2(x, i), where x ∈{0, 1, L, R} and 0 ≤i ≤B + 1: an error of type 2 used when the tape
of MB is wrongly copied;
• Error3: an error of type 3 is used in case nodes have inconsistent states;
• Error4(current state, tape content, i), where 0 ≤i ≤B + 2: an error of type 4 indicating that
the transition of MB is encoded incorrectly (this error captures also the case where the head
is missing);
• Error5(x) where x ∈{0, 1}: an error of type 5 used in the case when there is more than one
head.
3.2.4
LCL Constraints
The high level idea is the following. If the path encodes a good input, then nodes that are not
labeled Empty are required to output the input given to the ﬁrst node of the path (either a or b).
Otherwise, nodes can produce a locally checkable proof of an error (see Figure 2 for an example).
While nodes may output a or b even in the case in which the input is not a good input, nodes
must not be able to produce a proof error in the case in which the path encodes a good input. We
describe all these requirements as locally checkable constraints.
An output labeling for problem ΠMB is correct if the following conditions are satisﬁed for nodes
of the path P = (p0, . . . , pn−1). Note that, although nodes do not know their position on the path,
for the sake of simplicity we will denote with pi−1 the predecessor of pi, if it exists.

2. If Output(v) = Empty then Input(v) = Empty.
3. If v has no predecessors (i.e., v = p0) and Output(v) = Start(φ), then Input(v) = Start(φ).
4. If Output(pi−1) = a then Output(pi) ̸= b, and if Output(pi−1) = b then Output(pi) ̸= a.
5. If Output(pi) = Error0(j), then
• if j = 0 then the node has no predecessor;
• if j > 0 then Output(pi−1) = Error0(j −1).
6. If Output(pi) = Error1(j), then
• if j = 0, then Input(pi) = Separator;
• if j > 0 then Input(pi) ̸= Separator and Output(pi−1) = Error1(j −1).
7. If Output(pi) = Error2(x, j), then
• if j = 0, then Input(pi) = Tape(c, s, h) where h = false, c = x;

• if j = 0, then Input(pi) = Tape(c, s, h) where c = tape content, s = current state, h = true;
• if j = B and ϵ = ←, or j = B +1 and ϵ = −, or j = B +2 and ϵ = →(i.e., if node pi is an
“Error4 ﬁnal node”), then either current state is a ﬁnal state or Input(pi) = Tape(c, s, h)
where s ̸= transition state or h = false;
• otherwise, then Output(pi−1) = Error4(current state, tape content, j −1).
10. If Output(pi) = Error5(x)
• if Output(pi−1) ̸= Error5 then Input(pi) = Tape(c, s, h) where h = true and x = 0.
11. If Output(pi) = Error then one of the following condition holds:
• Input(pi) ̸= Start(φ) and pi has no predecessors;
• Input(pi) = Start(φ) and pi has a predecessor;
• Input(pi−1) or Output(pi−1) is Empty;
• Output(pi−1) = Error;
• Output(pi−1) = Error0(j), j > 0, and
– if j = 1 then Input(pi−1) ̸= Separator;
– if j ≥2 then either Input(pi−1) ̸= Tape, or Input(pi−1) = Tape(c, s, h) and:
∗if j = 2 either c ̸= L, or s ̸= q0 or h = false;
∗if 2 < j ≤B either c ̸= 0, or s ̸= q0 or h = true;

∗if j = B + 1, either c ̸= R, or s ̸= q0 or h = true;
• Input(pi) = Separator and Output(pi−1) = Error1(x) where x ̸= B;
• Input(pi) ̸= Separator and Output(pi−1) = Error1(B);
• Output(pi−1) = Error2(x, j) where j = B + 1;
• Output(pi−1) = Error3;
• pi−1 is an “Error4 ﬁnal node”;
• Output(pi−1) = Error5(x) and Input(pi−1) = Tape(c, s, h) where h = true and x = 1.
12. If Output(pi) is of type Errorx, then Output(pi−1) must not be of type Errory where y ̸= x.
The following property directly holds by deﬁnition of the constraints.
Property 1. Each node is able to locally check all constraints by just inspecting its own input and
output, and the ones of its predecessor (if it exists).
3.3
Upper Bound on the Complexity of the LCL
We need to consider two possible scenarios: either MB terminates within time T, or MB loops. In
the case in which MB loops, we show a simple O(n) algorithm that solves the LCL ΠMB. As we
know, any problem for which a solution exists can be solved in O(n) rounds in the LOCAL model by
gathering all the graph and solving the problem locally. There always exists a solution for problem
ΠMB if MB loops, in fact:
• If Input(p0) = Start(φ), then all nodes output φ, even if there are errors in the machine
encoding.
• Otherwise, if Input(p0) ̸= Start(φ), all nodes output Error.
It is easy to see that this output satisﬁes the LCL constraints described above.
Suppose that MB terminates. In this case, we show how to solve the LCL problem ΠMB in
constant time. More precisely, if MB terminates in T rounds, we show a distributed algorithm that
solves ΠMB in T ′ = 2+(B +1)T rounds. Each node v starts by gathering its T ′-radius neighborhood
Bv(T ′). Notice that, by deﬁnition, if the input is a good input, then for each node v that is taking
part in the encoding of the execution of MB (i.e., Input(v) ̸= Empty), Bv(T ′) contains p0. Hence, if
a node v does not see p0 after gathering its ball Bv(T ′), it means that the input is not a good input.
So, after gathering its T ′-radius ball, each node v does the following.
• If Input(v) = Empty, then Output(v) = Empty.
• If Bv(T ′) does not contain p0, or if Input(p0) ̸= Start(φ), then v outputs Error.
• If Bv(T ′) is a good input, then v outputs Start(φ).
The remaining case that we still need to handle is when Bv(T ′) contains p0, Input(p0) = Start(φ),
but Bv(T ′) does not look like a good input. We want nodes to produce a proof of an error in some
consistent way. Thus, we show that nodes can identify the ﬁrst error and produce a proof based on
that. First of all, notice that, since v sees the ﬁrst node in the path, v can compute its position i on
the path. Also, node v can identify who is the ﬁrst node u not satisfying the constraints of being a
good input. Let j be the position of u in the path, that is u = pj. Now we distinguish the following
cases based on Bu(B + 2) (the output of each node will be determined by the ﬁrst case encountered
in the following list).
9

--- Page 11 ---
1. If Input(pj) = Start(φ) and j ̸= 0, then, if i < j, Output(v) = Start(φ); otherwise Output(v) =
Error.
2. If j ≤B + 1, it means that either the initial state is encoded incorrectly, or the tape is not
initialized correctly, or the head is not initialized on the correct position. In this case, if i ≤j,
then Output(v) = Error0(i), otherwise Output(v) = Error.
3. If Input(pj−(B+1)) = Separator and Input(pj) ̸= Separator, then the length of the tape is too
long, and u expected to have in input Separator. Then, if i < j −(B +1), Output(v) = Start(φ);
if i > j then Output(v) = Error; otherwise, Output(v) = Error1(i −j + B + 1).
4. If Input(pj) = Separator and there exists a k such that 1 ≤j −k < B + 1 such that
Input(pk) = Separator, then the length of the tape is too short, and u did not expect to have a
separator. In this case, if i < k then Output(v) = Start(φ); if i ≥j then Output(v) = Error;
otherwise Output(v) = Error1(k −i).
5. If Input(pj−(B+1)) = Tape(c, s, h) where h = false, c = x, and Input(pj) = Tape(c′, s′, h′), where
c′ ̸= x, then the tape of MB has been copied incorrectly. In this case, if i < j −(B + 1), then
Output(v) = Start(φ); if i > j then Output(v) = Error; otherwise, Output(v) = Error2(x, i −j +
B + 1).
6. If Input(pj) = Tape(c, s, h) and Input(pj−1) = Separator and there exists a k < j + B such
that Input(pk) = Tape(c′, s′, h′) and that s ̸= s′, it means that nodes have inconsistent states.
Consider the minimum k satisfying the constraints. If i < k then Output(v) = Start(φ); if
i > k then Output(v) = Error; otherwise, Output(v) = Error3.
7. If none of the above is satisﬁed, it means that there exist a k satisfying j −k ≤B +2, such that
Input(pk) = Tape(c, s, h) and h = true. Let (transition state, new content, ϵ) = δ(s, c). It holds
that if ϵ is ←, −, or →, then j−k is respectively B, B+1, or B+2. If Input(pj) = Tape(c′, s′, h′),
where either h′ = false, or transition state ̸= s′, or s is a ﬁnal state, then there is some
error in the transition (this captures also the case where there is no head). If i < k, then
Output(v) = Start(φ); if i > j then Output(v) = Error; otherwise, Output(v) = Error4(s, c, k−i).
Notice that this case captures also the one where the head is missing.
8. If Input(pj) = Tape(c, s, h) where h = true, since all the above cases are not satisﬁed, it means
that there exists a k, such that Input(pk) = Tape(c′, s′, h′), h′ = true, |j −k| < B and all nodes
pmin(j,k), . . . , pmax(j,k) are labeled with some Tape. That is, there are at least two heads, one
on node pj and one on node pk. In this case, if i < min(j, k), then Output(v) = Start(φ); if
i > max(j, k) then Output(v) = Error; if i = min(j, k) then Output(v) = Error5(0), otherwise
Output(v) = Error5(1).
If the path encodes a good input, every node taking part in the encoding of the execution of MB
outputs Start(φ), and in this case it is easy to see that the output satisﬁes the LCL constraints.
Therefore, assume that the path does not correctly encode the execution of MB starting from
the correct tape content. First of all, notice that the algorithm handles all possible errors in the
machine encoding, that is, if the input is not good, at least one case of the list applies. Consider
all nodes v that do not have in input Empty, that is, all nodes taking part in the encoding of the
execution of MB. If node v sees the ﬁrst node p0, i.e., if the distance between p0 and v is at most
T ′ (notice that a good input has length T ′), then it is easy to see that the output satisﬁes the LCL
constraints. Some care is needed in the case where a node v outputs a generic error Error and v
does not see p0: we need to show that also in this case the output is valid, meaning that the LCL
10

--- Page 12 ---
constraints are satisﬁed. In this case, the distance between p0 and v is strictly greater than T ′, and
since the encoding of the execution of MB is not correct, then
• either the path (p0, . . . , v) does not correctly encode the execution of MB,
• or MB is not correctly initialized and it loops.
In the ﬁrst case, some node on the path between p0 and v will output some speciﬁc error Errorx where
x > 0, while in the second case initial nodes will output Error0. In both scenarios the constraints for
Error are satisﬁed. The complexity of the algorithm is O(B · T).
3.4
Lower Bound on the Complexity of the LCL
Let us deﬁne T ′′ as follows. If MB terminates in time T, then T ′′ = T ′ = 2 + (B + 1)T. If MB loops,
then T ′′ = n. We prove a lower bound on the complexity of ΠMB of Ω(T ′′) rounds, by showing that
Ω(T ′′) rounds are needed in the case where the input is a good input. In particular, we show that,
in a good input, for all nodes v such that Input(v) ̸= Empty, Output(v) must be Start(φ). The result
then comes from the fact that, for some nodes, it requires Ω(T ′′) rounds in order to see if φ = a or
φ = b.
First of all, we ignore nodes that have in input Empty since, in a good input, they are at distance
at least T ′′ + 1 from p0, the ﬁrst node of the path. Hence, assume that a node v not having Empty in
input does not output Start(φ). In this case, v can either output a generic error Error, or a speciﬁc
error Errorx. If all nodes output Error, the veriﬁer rejects on p0. If all nodes, starting from a node
pi where i > 0, output Error, and all nodes pi′ with i′ < i output Start(φ), then the veriﬁer rejects
on pi. Therefore, let us assume that there is at least a node that outputs a speciﬁc error Errorx. We
write succ(v) and dist(u, v) to denote respectively the successor of a node v in the path, and the
distance between two nodes u and v in the path.
• If x = 0, the veriﬁer accepts only if this error produces a chain that starts from p0 and
proceeds with increasing values. In order to be accepted, this chain must end at a node w′,
and succ(w′) must output Error. Then, succ(w′) must witness that w′ indeed has a local error
in the machine initialization, which is not possible in a good input.
• If x = 1, we could have two cases:
– there is a chain of increasing values that starts from a node w with Input(w) = Separator,
and ends on a node w′ such that dist(w, w′) < B, Input(succ(w′)) = Separator, and
Output(succ(w′)) = Error (the tape is too short);
– there is a chain of increasing values that starts from a node w with Input(w) = Separator,
and ends on a node w′ such that dist(w, w′) = B, Input(succ(w′)) ̸= Separator, and
Output(succ(w′)) = Error (the tape is too long).
Since, in a good input, the distance between two nodes having in input Separator is always
B + 1, the above scenarios are not possible.
• If x = 2, there must be a chain of length exactly B + 1, starting from a node w having
Input(w) = Tape(c, s, h), where c = x ∈{0, 1}, h = false, and ending on a node w′ such that
dist(w, w′) = B + 1, and Input(w′) = Tape(c′, s′, h′), where c′ ̸= x. In a good input, the tape
content of nodes w and w′ must be the same.
• If x = 3, it means that there must exist two neighbors having two diﬀerent states, and this
can not happen in a good input.
11

--- Page 13 ---
• If x = 4, there must be a chain that propagates the old state and old input, and the veriﬁer
accepts only if acknowledges that the transition has been wrongly encoded, which can not the
case in a good input.
• If x = 5, there must be a chain of length at least 2 not passing through nodes having in input
Separator, starting from a node w with Input(w) = Tape(c, s, h) where h = true, and ending
on a node w′ with Input(w′) = Tape(c′, s′, h′) where h′ = true. This is not possible on a good
input.
Therefore, since nodes can not output any kind of error, and since Empty is not a valid output for
the nodes encoding the LBA, then these nodes must output Start(φ), where the value of φ matches
the input of the ﬁrst node of the path. Hence, ΠMB requires Ω(T ′′).
3.5
Normalizing an LCL Problem
We now show how to β-normalize an LCL ΠMB and obtain a new LCL having roughly the same time
complexity. We deﬁne three diﬀerent veriﬁers depending on their view.
• A Vin,in −out,out veriﬁer running at node v, checks Input(v), Input(pred(v)), Output(v), and
Output((pred(v)).
• A Vin −out veriﬁer running at node v, checks Input(v) and Output(v).
• A Vout −out veriﬁer running at node v checks Output(v) and Output((pred(v)).
Lemma 2. Consider an LCL P with |ΣP
in| = α and |ΣP
out| = β that can be solved in time T and can
be locally checked with a Vin,in −out,out veriﬁer. It is possible to deﬁne an LCL P′ such that |ΣP′
in | = α
and |ΣP′
out| = α · β that can be solved in time T and can be locally checked with a Vin −out and a
Vout −out veriﬁer.
Proof. We deﬁne ΣP′
in = ΣP
in, and ΣP′
out = ΣP
out × ΣP
out. Let Output(v) = (in, out) ∈ΣP′
out. Let
Output(pred(v)) = (in′, out′) ∈ΣP′
out. The Vin −out veriﬁer checks that Input(v) = in. The Vout −out
veriﬁer acts the same as the Vin,in −out,out veriﬁer executed on ((in′, out′), (in, out)). The LCL problem
P′ can be solved with the following algorithm at each node v.
• Gather the ball Bv(T).
• Simulate the original algorithm on Bv(T); let out be the output of this simulation.
• Output (Input(v), out).
It is easy to check that this output is valid for the problem P′, and that it requires T rounds. Also,
note that it is not possible to solve P′ faster than T. In fact, in order to satisfy the Vin −out veriﬁer,
the input must be copied correctly; while in order to satisfy the Vout −out veriﬁer, we need to satisfy
the Vin,in −out,out veriﬁer executed giving the same input that it would have seen on P.
Lemma 3. Consider an LCL P with |ΣP
in| = α and |ΣP
out| = β that can be solved in time T and can
be locally checked with a Vin −out and a Vout −out veriﬁer. We can deﬁne a β′-normalized LCL P′
with β′ = |ΣP′
out| = 2γ · (|ΣP
out| + 3) that can be solved in time Θ(γ · T(n/γ)), where γ = 2⌈log α⌉+ 3.
Proof. In the following we will exploit the ability of an algorithm to work on identiﬁers that can
be polynomial in the size of the graph. In particular, we assume that if an algorithm works on an
instance with IDs in the range 1, . . . , r, then it works also on an instance with IDs in the range
1, . . . , γ · r. Then, we show how to deﬁne an LCL P′ such that:
• if the input instance encodes a virtual instance for the problem P, it is required to solve P on
the virtual instance;
12

--- Page 14 ---
• otherwise, it is required to prove that the encoding is wrong.
Let V′
in −out and V′
out −out be the veriﬁers of our β′-normalized LCL.
Encoding P in P′.
We start by deﬁning how to encode an instance of P of size n, as an
instance of P′ of size N = γ · n. We denote with p0, . . . , pn−1 and p′
0, . . . , p′
γ·n−1 respectively the
instance of P and the one of P′. Let a = ⌈log α⌉. For the sake of simplicity, let us rename nodes
p′
γi, . . . , p′
γ(i+1)−1, where 0 ≤i ≤n −1, as qi
0, . . . , qi
2a+2 (notice that 2a + 2 = γ −1). The ﬁrst a + 1
nodes, qi
0, . . . , qi
a, have input 1, while nodes qi
a+1 and qi
2a+2 have input 0. Each of the remaining a
nodes, qi
a+2, . . . , qi
2a+1, has in input one bit of the binary representation of Input(pi), in some ﬁxed
order (see Figure 3 for an illustration).
The V′
in −out Veriﬁer.
The set of output labels of P′ is ΣP′
out = 2γ × (Σout ∪{Er, E, El}). Let qi
j
be a node of the instance of P′ where 0 ≤i ≤n −1 and 0 ≤j ≤2a + 2. Let Input(qi
j) ∈{0, 1}, and
let Output(qi
j) = ((b0, . . . , b2a+2), out) ∈ΣP′
out. The V′
in −out veriﬁer running at qi
j checks that
• Input(qi
j) = b0, and
• if out ∈ΣP
out, then
– if all bits in b0, . . . , ba are 1s, checks that the original Vin −out veriﬁer accepts on
(x, out), where x is obtained by recovering the input pi for the original algorithm from
ba+2, . . . , b2a+1.
The V′
out −out Veriﬁer.
Let the output of pi
j be ((b0, . . . , b2a+2), out) ∈ΣP′
out and the output of
the predecessor of pi
j be ((b′
0, . . . , b′
2a+2), out′) ∈ΣP′
out The O-O veriﬁer ﬁrst checks that
• b0 = b′
1, b1 = b′
2, . . . , b2a+1 = b′
2a+2, and
• if out ∈ΣP
out and out′ ∈ΣP
out, then
– if at least one bit in b0, . . . , ba is 0 , then out = out′,
– if all bits in b0, . . . , ba are 1s, then check that the original Vout −out executed on (out′, out)
accepts.
Dealing with Errors.
We now add some constraints to handle the case in which out /∈
ΣP
out. Let the output of pi
j be ((b0, . . . , b2a+2), out) and the output of the predecessor of pi
j be
((b′
0, . . . , b′
2a+2), out′). The V′
in −out veriﬁer additionally checks that, if out = E, then the encoding is
not locally valid, that is,
• either
– there are two numbers x, y ≥0, x + y ≤a, such that b0, . . . , bx−1 and b2a+3−y, . . . , b2a+2
are all equal to 1, bx = 0, b2a+2−y = 0, and
– there is not a contiguous sequence of length a + 1 of all 1s in b0, . . . , b2a+2,
• or b0, . . . , ba are all 1s but either ba+1 ̸= 0 or b2a+2 ̸= 0.
The V′
out −out veriﬁer running on pi
j additionally checks that,
• if out = El, then pi
j must have a predecessor, and it must hold that out′ /∈{Er} ∪ΣP
out;
• if out ∈ΣP
out, if pi
j has a predecessor, then out′ must be diﬀerent from Er;
• if out = Er, then pi
j must have a successor.
13

--- Page 15 ---
Let N be the size of the graph. An algorithm solving P′ in (γ + 1) · T rounds does the following at
each node v′:
• Gather the ball Bv′((γ + 1) · T).
• If Bv′((γ + 1) · T) looks like a correct encoding of an input instance of P
– let u′ be the nearest left node having input 1 and other a successors, succ(1)u′, . . . , succ(a)u′,
having also input 1
– Compute the virtual instance for P (setting the IDs to be the same of the nodes satisfying
the above)
– Simulate the original algorithm on the virtual instance by setting n = N/γ, let out be
the output of u′
– Output ((Input(v′), Input(succ(1)v′), . . . , Input(succ(γ−1)v′), out)
• Otherwise,
– if there is a local error, output E
– if the nearest error is on the left, output El
– otherwise, output Er
It is easy to check that the output of the algorithm satisﬁes the constraints. In order to show a
lower bound for the new LCL, we now show that it is not possible to produce errors in a graph
that is a valid encoding. In fact, nodes can not cheat by wrongly outputting the input of the
neighbors, otherwise either the input-output veriﬁer notices inconsistencies on the ﬁrst bit, or the
output-output veriﬁer notices inconsistencies on the other bits. Then, on a valid encoding, no input
satisﬁes the constraints that allows to produce E as output. Finally, the constraints impose that a
chain of Er or El points to a node that is outputting E.
Note that, if the original LCL has complexity T, then the new LCL, on instances of size N = γ ·n,
has complexity Θ(γ(T(n))) = Θ(γ · T(N
γ )).
3.6
Hardness Results
Theorem 4. There are β-normalized LCLs that can be solved in constant time but the distributed
time complexity is 2Ω(β).
Proof. The complexity of ΠMB is Θ(B · T) if MB terminates in T steps.
|Σin| = O(1) and
|Σout| = Θ(B). We can convert it to an LCL where |Σin| = 2, |Σout| = Θ(B), and the complexity is
still Θ(B · T). There exist LBAs that terminate in 2Θ(B) steps (e.g. a binary counter). Thus, the
complexity of the obtained LCL is Θ(B · 2Θ(B)), that is 2Ω(B) = 2Ω(|Σout|) = 2Ω(β).
Theorem 5. It is PSPACE-hard to distinguish whether a given LCL problem P with input labels
can be solved in O(1) time or needs Ω(n) time on globally oriented path graphs.
Proof. It is PSPACE-hard to distinguish whether a given LBA terminates or loops (see e.g. [10]).
Note that the description of a β-normalized LCL has size O(β2). In order to decide if a β-normalized
version of a problem in Π requires O(1) or Ω(n) we need to decide if its associated LBA, running on
a tape of size B = Θ(β), terminates or loops, and this implies the theorem.
14

--- Page 16 ---
3.7
Extending the Results to Undirected Cycles
We show how to extend the above results, which apply to globally oriented paths, to the case where
the input graph is an undirected path or an undirected cycle. We ﬁrst focus on showing how to
adapt these results to undirected paths. Given a β-normalized LCL P deﬁned on directed paths,
we can deﬁne an LCL P′ in which the set of input labels is Σ′
in = {0, 1} × {0, 1, 2}, and the set of
output labels is Σ′
out = {0, 1, 2} × {1, . . . , β, E}. Let Vin −out and Vout −out be the veriﬁers of the
β-normalized LCL P, and let V′
in −out and V′
out −out be the veriﬁers of the LCL P′. The idea is that
we can use 3 symbols to give an orientation as input to the nodes, by giving 0 to the ﬁrst node, 1 to
the second, 2 to the third, 0 to the fourth, and so on. Nodes must copy their orientation number to
the output, and then, if the given orientation is consistent, nodes are required to solve the original
problem P. On the other hand, if the orientation is not consistent, nodes are allowed to output an
error E. Also, in order to avoid the need of error pointers, we allow nodes to treat the places where
the orientation is not consistent, as a place where the path ends.
This new LCL can be checked as follows. The V′
in −out veriﬁer takes in input the input and
the output of the current node (as before) and ﬁrst checks that the orientation has been copied
correctly, and then checks that the original Vin −out veriﬁer accepts. To verify the output, we allow
the V′
out −out veriﬁer to see slightly more than the original veriﬁer Vout −out. The V′
out −out veriﬁer
sees a triple containing the output of the node and the outputs of its neighbors. Note that the
veriﬁer does not know the orientation of the path (and the orientation of the triple), but it can
recover it from the output of the nodes (that contains a copy of the orientation given as input).
Then the V′
out −out veriﬁer checks that, if the node outputted E, the orientation is indeed wrong. If
the output is a value in 1, . . . , β, the veriﬁer V′
out −out runs the original Vout −out veriﬁer, since it
can compute which neighbor is the predecessor. It is easy to see that the complexity of P′ is the
same as the one of P.
The LCL description of P′, that is, the size of its input, its output, and its veriﬁer, is now O(β3),
therefore the hardness result still applies.
We now show how an LCL for paths can be converted to an LCL for cycles. The idea is the
following. On a cycle, we give an additional input to each node in {0, 1}. Nodes marked as 1 are
exempt to solve the problem and act as separators between the other nodes. That is, nodes are
required to solve the original problem on the subpaths that lie between nodes marked as 1. It may
be the case that no node has 1 as input. In this case we allow nodes to output a special error. If a
node decides to output this error, both its neighbors must output the same, that is, all nodes must
output the same. We impose the constraint that a node marked as 1 can not output this error. A
worst case instance would be the one in which one node is marked 1 and all other nodes are marked
0—this would represent a path with a length that is roughly equal to the one of the cycle. There
is one case that requires a bit of care: if all nodes are marked 0, but the original problem can be
solved in sublinear time, nodes could not be able to coordinate to produce the special error. For our
purpose, it is possible to check that, if we consider the problem ΠMB previously deﬁned in the case
in which MB terminates, in an instance in which nobody has a predecessor, nodes can eﬃciently
solve the problem by just outputting Error or Empty, depending on their input.
3.8
Encoding Input Labels as Trees
In this section we demonstrate a reduction from the LCL problem P with input labels on any graph
G to an LCL problem P⋆without input labels on the modiﬁed graph G⋆. The modiﬁed graph G⋆
is the result of attaching a rooted tree to each v ∈V (G) that encodes the input label of v for the
LCL problem P. The reduction allows us to extend the hardness proof to the case of LCL problems
15

--- Page 17 ---
without input labels.
Encoding.
Given a 2k-bit binary string S = (s1, . . . , s2k), deﬁne Enc(S) as the rooted tree
constructed as follows.
• Begin with the full binary tree which has 2k leaves, and the distance from the root to each
leaf is k.
• For each non-leaf node v, let u be any one of its two children, and subdivide the edge {v, u}
into two edges {v, w} and {w, u}, where w is a new node. The node w is designated as the
left child of v.
• Let U = (u1 . . . , u2k) be the leaves ordered by the in-order traversal.
• For each i ∈[2k], add two new nodes x and y as the children of ui. If si = 1, add two more
new nodes x′ and y′ and the two edges {x, x′} and {y, y′}.
The tree Enc(S) has maximum degree 3, and all nodes are within distance 2(k + 1) to the root.
Given a graph G such that each node v ∈V (G) is associated with an input label L(v) ∈Σin, deﬁne
G⋆as the graph resulting from the following operations on G. For each node v ∈V (G), attach the
rooted tree T = Enc(L(v)) to v by adding the edge {v, z}, where z is the root of T. Notice that
∆(G⋆) = max{3, ∆(G) + 1}.
Decoding.
Given a rooted tree T = Enc(S) for some S ∈{0, 1}2k, deﬁne Dec(T) = S. The
decoding can be done by the following procedure. Consider an in-order traversal of the tree such
that (i) for each node v such that exactly one of its children w has degree 2, treat w as the left child
of v, (ii) print ‘1’ if a node that has two children of degree 2 is encountered, (iii) print ‘0’ if a node
that has two children of degree 1 is encountered. Then the printed sequence is S.
The Modiﬁed LCL Problem P⋆.
Let P be an LCL problem with input labels. Suppose that
the radius of P is r, and the maximum degree is ∆. Set k = ⌈log log |Σin|⌉, and let each label in Σin
be represented by a distinct 2k-bit string. The modiﬁed LCL problem P⋆, which does not require
input label, is deﬁned by the following rules. The set of the output labels of P⋆is Σout, the same as
that of P. Let G⋆be a graph with maximum degree ≤∆+ 1.
• Deﬁne G1 = G⋆.
For each 2 ≤i ≤k + 2, deﬁne Gi as the graph induced by nodes in V (G⋆) −Si−1
j=1(Aj ∪Bj).
For each i ∈[k + 2], deﬁne Ai = {v ∈V (Gi)| degGi(v) = 1}.
For each i ∈[k + 1], deﬁne Bi = {v ∈V (Gi)| degGi(v) = 2 and ∃u ∈Ai s.t. {u, v} ∈E(Gi)}.
• Deﬁne Vlabel = Sk+2
j=1 Aj ∪Sk+1
j=1 Bj.
Deﬁne Vmain as the set of nodes in V (G⋆) \ Vlabel that have exactly one neighbor in Vlabel.
• For each v ∈Vmain, deﬁne L(v) as follows. Let u be the unique node in Vlabel adjacent to
v, and let T be the connected component induced by nodes in Vlabel that contains u. Set
L(v) = Dec(T) (with u being the root of T). If the decoding procedure Dec(T) fails, simply
set L(v) as the ﬁrst label in Σin.
• The output labeling, together with the input labeling deﬁned by the function L(·), forms a
legal labeling of the subgraph induced by the nodes in Vmain for P.
16

--- Page 18 ---
Notice that the connected components in Vlabel are the trees encoding input labels, and the subgraph
induced by the nodes in Vmain is G (as long as G does not contain isolated node). The function L(v)
recovers the input label of v for each v ∈V (G). Given that P has a valid labeling on all graphs
(resp., trees) of maximum degree ∆, the modiﬁed LCL problem P⋆also has a valid labeling on all
graphs (resp., trees) of maximum degree ∆+ 1.
Reducing the Radius.
The above deﬁnition of P⋆requires radius r + O(k), as a node v ∈Vmain
needs O(k) extra rounds to calculate L(u) for all u ∈Nr(v)∪Vmain. We present a simple modiﬁcation
that reduces the radius to only r + O(1) at the cost of expanding the number of output labels from
|Σout| to |Σout| + 22k < |Σout| + |Σin|2. The idea is to let nodes in Vlabel to use output labels to
pass the information stored at the leaves to the root based on local rules. Consider a connected
component T induced by nodes in Vlabel. The subgraph T is interpreted as a tree rooted at the
unique node in T that is adjacent to some node in Vmain.
Base Case: Let v ∈A2. If v is adjacent to two nodes in B1, the output label of v is 1; otherwise
the output label of v is 0.
Root / Degree-3 Nodes: Let 3 ≤i ≤k + 2, and let v ∈Ai. Then v has a unique neighbor
uleft ∈Bi+1 and a unique neighbor uright ∈Ai+1. Let Sleft be the output label of uleft, and let
Sright be the output label of uright. Then the output label of v is the binary string Sleft ◦Sright.
Degree-2 Nodes: Let 3 ≤i ≤k + 1, and let v ∈Bi. Then v has a unique neighbor u ∈Ai+1. The
output label of v is the same as the output label of u.
Thus, for each node v ∈Vmain, L(v) is simply the output label of the unique node u ∈Vlabel ∩N(v).
Theorem 6. For any LCL problem P on any graph G of maximum degree ∆that does not have
isolated nodes, the following two statements are equivalent.
• The labeling L: V (G) →Σout is a valid labeling of G for the problem P.
• There exists some labeling L′ of the nodes in Vlabel such that L and L′ together form a valid
labeling of G⋆for the problem P⋆.
Theorem 7. It is PSPACE-hard to distinguish whether a given LCL problem P without input labels
can be solved in O(1) time or needs Ω(n) time on trees with degree ∆= 3.

Decidability
In this section, we show that the two gaps ω(1)—o(log∗n) and ω(log∗n)—o(n) for LCL problems
with input labels on paths and cycles are decidable. More speciﬁcally, given a speciﬁcation of an
LCL problem P, there is an algorithm that outputs a description of an asymptotically optimal
deterministic LOCAL algorithm for P, as well as its time complexity.
We will prove the statements for the case of cycles, but the analogous results for cycles and paths
follows as a simple corollary, as we can encode constraints related to degree-1 nodes as constraints
related to nodes adjacent to a special input label. Furthermore, having a promise that the input is
a path does not change the time complexity of an LCL problem: if a problem can be solved in time
T = o(n) in labeled paths, the same algorithm will solve it also in time T = o(n) in labeled cycles.
The proof of Theorem 8 is in Section 4.2; the proof of Theorem 9 is in Section 4.5.
17

--- Page 19 ---
Theorem 8. For any LCL problem P on cycle graphs, its deterministic LOCAL complexity is either
Ω(n) or O(log∗n). Moreover, there is an algorithm that decides whether P has complexity Ω(n)
or O(log∗n) on cycle graphs; for the case the complexity is O(log∗n), the algorithm outputs a
description of an O(log∗n)-round deterministic LOCAL algorithm that solves P.
Theorem 9. For any LCL problem P on cycle graphs, its deterministic LOCAL complexity is either
Ω(log∗n) or O(1). Moreover, there is an algorithm that decides whether P has complexity Ω(log∗n)
or O(1) on cycle graphs; for the case the complexity is O(1), the algorithm outputs a description of
an O(1)-round deterministic LOCAL algorithm that solves P.
Graph Notation.
For convenience, in this section, a directed path P with input labels is
alternatively described as a string in Σk
in, where k > 0 is the number of nodes in P. Similarly,
an output labeling L of P is alternatively described as a string in Σk
out. In subsequent discussion,
we freely switch between the graph-theoretic notation and the string notation. Given an output
labeling L of P, we say that L is locally consistent at v if the input and output labeling assigned to
Nr(v) is acceptable for v. Note that Nr(v) refers to the radius-r neighborhood of v. Given two
integers a ≤b, the notation [a, b] represents the set of all integers {a, a + 1, . . . , b}. Given a string
w, denote wR as the reverse of w.
Overview.
Before we proceed, we brieﬂy discuss the high level idea of the proofs. The main tool
underlying the proofs is the “pumping lemma” which was developed in [6]. Intuitively, we classify
the set of all input-labeled paths into a ﬁnite number of equivalence classes satisfying the following
property. Let P be a subpath of G, and let P ′ be another path that is of the same equivalence
class as P. Given a complete legal labeling of G, if we let G′ be the result of replacing P with
P ′, then it is always possible to extend this partial labeling of G′ to a complete legal labeling by
appropriately labeling P ′. The pumping lemma guarantees that for any path P whose length is
at least the pumping constant ℓpump, and for any number x ≥ℓpump, there is another path P ′ of
length at least x and P ′ is of the same equivalence class as P.
Informally, in the proof of Theorem 8, we show that any LCL problem P solvable in o(n) rounds
can be solved in O(log∗n) rounds in the following canonical way based on a “feasible labeling
function” f. Intuitively, a labeling function f is feasible if for any given independent set I that is
suﬃciently well-spaced, we can apply f to assign the output labels to each v ∈I and its nearby
neighbors locally such that this partial labeling can always be extended to a complete legal labeling.
The ω(log∗n)—o(n) gap and the decidability result follows from these two claims.
• If there is an o(n)-round algorithm A that solves P, then a feasible function f exists. This
is proved by ﬁrst create an imaginary graph where some paths are extended using pumping
lemmas, and then apply a simulation of A on the imaginary graph.
• Whether a feasible function exists is decidable. Intuitively, this is due to the fact that the
number of equivalence classes is ﬁnite.
The proof of Theorem 9 is a little more complicated since the time budget is only O(1), so
we cannot even aﬀord to ﬁnd an MIS. To solve this issue, we decompose the cycle graph G into
paths with unrepetitive patterns and paths with repetitive patterns, in O(1) rounds. For paths
with unrepetitive patterns, we are able to compute a suﬃciently well-spaced MIS in O(1) rounds
by making use of the irregularity of the input patterns. Paths with repetitive patterns are similar
to the paths without input labels, and we will show that we can always label them by repetitive
output patterns, given that the underlying LCL problem is o(log∗n)-time solvable.

4.1
Pumping Lemmas for Paths
Let P = (s, . . . , t) be a directed path, where each node has an input label from Σin. The tripartition
of the nodes ξ(P) = (D1, D2, D3) is deﬁned as follows:
D1 = Nr−1(s) ∪Nr−1(t),
D2 =
 N2r−1(s) ∪N2r−1(t)

\ D1,
D3 = P \ (D1 ∪D2).
See Figure 4 for an illustration. More speciﬁcally, suppose P = (u1, . . . , uk), and let i ∈[1, k]. Then
we have:
• ui ∈D1 if and only if i ∈[1, r] ∪[k −r + 1, k].
• ui ∈D2 if and only if i ∈[r + 1, 2r] ∪[k −2r + 1, k −r].
• ui ∈D3 if and only if i /∈[1, 2r] ∪[k −2r + 1, k].
Let L: D1 ∪D2 →Σout assign output labels to D1 ∪D2. We say that L is extendible w.r.t. P if
there exists a complete labeling L⋄of P such that L⋄agrees with L on D1 ∪D2, and L⋄is locally
consistent at all nodes in D2 ∪D3.
An Equivalence Class.
We deﬁne an equivalence class ⋆∼for the directed paths (i.e., the set of
all non-empty strings in Σ∗
in), as follows.
Consider two directed paths P = (u1, . . . , ux) and P ′ = (v1, . . . , vy), and let ξ(P) = (D1, D2, D3)
and ξ(P ′) = (D′
1, D′
2, D′
3). Consider the following natural 1-to-1 correspondence φ: (D1 ∪D2) →
(D′
1 ∪D′
2) deﬁned as φ(ui) = vi and φ(ux−i+1) = vy−i+1 for each i ∈[1, 2r].
The 1-to-1
correspondence is well-deﬁned so long as (i) x = y or (ii) x ≥4r and y ≥4r. We have P
⋆∼P ′ if
and only if the following two statements are met:
• Isomorphism: The 1-to-1 correspondence φ is well-deﬁned, and for each ui ∈D1 ∪D2,
the input label of ui is identical to the input label of φ(ui).
• Extendibility: Let L be any assignment of output labels to nodes in D1 ∪D2, and let
L′ be the corresponding output labeling of D′
1 ∪D′
2 under φ. Then L is extendible w.r.t.
P if and only if L′ is extendible w.r.t. P ′.
Note that for the special case of x ≤4r, we have P
⋆∼P ′ if and only if P is identical to P ′.
Deﬁne Type(P) as the equivalence class of P w.r.t. ⋆∼. The following technical lemma is analogous
to [6, Lemma 1] in a specialized setting. We only use this lemma to prove the lemmas in Section 4.1.
19

Lemma 10. Let G be a path graph or a cycle graph where all nodes have input labels from Σin. Let
P be a directed subpath of G, and let P ′ be another directed path such that Type(P ′) = Type(P).
We write ξ(P) = (D1, D2, D3) and ξ(P ′) = (D′
1, D′
2, D′
3). Let L⋄be any complete labeling of G
such that L⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in D2 ∪D3. Let G′ = Replace(G, P, P ′) be the graph
resulting from replacing P with P ′ in G. Then there exists a complete labeling L′
⋄of G′ such that
the following two conditions are met.
1. For each v ∈(V (G) \ V (P))∪(D1∪D2) and its corresponding v′ ∈(V (G′) \ V (P ′))∪(D′
1∪D′
2),
we have L⋄(v) = L′
⋄(v′). Moreover, if v ∈(V (G) \ V (P)) ∪D1 and L⋄is locally consistent at
v, then L′
⋄is locally consistent at v′.
2. L′
⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in D′
2 ∪D′
3.
Proof. The labeling L′
⋄(v′) of G′ for each v′ ∈(V (G′) \ V (P ′)) ∪(D′
1 ∪D′
2) is chosen “naturally”
as follows.
For each v′ ∈V (G′) \ V (P ′), we set L′
⋄(v′) = L⋄(v) for its corresponding node
v ∈V (G)\V (P). For each v′ ∈D′
1∪D′
2, we set L′
⋄(v′) = L⋄(v) for its corresponding node v ∈D1∪D2
such that φ(v) = v′ in the deﬁnition of ⋆∼. At this point, it is clear that if v ∈(V (G) \ V (P)) ∪D1
has a locally consistent labeling under L⋄, then its corresponding node v′ ∈(V (G′) \ V (P ′)) ∪D′
1
also has a locally consistent labeling under L′
⋄, so Condition 1 holds.
Now, the labeling L′
⋄is only undeﬁned for nodes in D′
3. We show that we can complete the
labeling in such a way that is locally consistent at all nodes in D′
2 ∪D′
3. Denote L as L⋄restricted
to D1 ∪D2. Since L⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in P, the labeling L is extendible w.r.t. P.
Note that if we let L′ be L⋄restricted to D′
1 ∪D′
2, then according to the way we deﬁne L′
⋄, the two
labeling L′ and L are identical under the 1-to-1 correspondence φ speciﬁed in the deﬁnition of ⋆∼.
That is, for each v′ ∈D′
1 ∪D′
2, we have L′(v′) = L(v) for its corresponding node v ∈D1 ∪D2 such
that φ(v) = v′. Since P
⋆∼P ′, the labeling L′ must be extendible w.r.t. P ′. That is, there is a way
to assign L′
⋄(v′) for each v′ ∈D′
3 such that all nodes in D′
2 ∪D′
3 have locally consistent labelings
under L′
⋄, so Condition 2 holds.
One useful consequence of this lemma is that if we start with a path or a cycle G with a legal
labeling, after replacing its subpath P with another one P ′ having the same type as P, then it
is always possible to assign output labeling to P ′ to get a legal labeling without changing the
already-assigned output labels of nodes outside of P ′.
Lemma 11. Let G be a path graph or a cycle graph where all nodes have input labels from Σin. Let
P be a directed subpath of G, and let P ′ be another directed path such that Type(P ′) = Type(P). Let
L⋄be complete labeling of G that is locally consistent at all nodes in P. Let G′ = Replace(G, P, P ′)
be the graph resulting from replacing P with P ′ in G. Then there exists a legal labeling L′
⋄of G′
such that the following two conditions are met.
1. For each v ∈V (G) \ V (P) and its corresponding v′ ∈V (G′) \ V (P ′), we have L⋄(v) = L′
⋄(v′).
Moreover, if L⋄is locally consistent at v ∈V (G) \ V (P), then L′
⋄is locally consistent at v′.
2. L′
⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in P ′.
Proof. We write ξ(P ′) = (D′
1, D′
2, D′
3). Condition 1 in this lemma is implied by Condition 1 in
Lemma 10. To see that Condition 2 in this lemma holds, note that in this lemma we additionally
require that L⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in P. Therefore, Condition 1 of Lemma 10 implies
that L′
⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in D′
1. This observation, together with Condition 2 of
Lemma 10, implies that L′
⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in P ′.
20

The following lemma is analogous to [6, Theorem 4] in a specialized setting. We only use this
lemma in Section 4.1.
Lemma 12. Let P = (v1, . . . , vk), and let P ′ = (v1, . . . , vk−1). Let the input label of vk be α. Then
Type(P) is a function of α and Type(P ′).
Proof. We prove the following stronger statement. Let G be a directed path, and let H be a
directed subpath of G.
Suppose H′ is another directed path satisfying Type(H) = Type(H′).
Let G′ = Replace(G, H, H′) be the result of replacing H with H′ in G.
Then we claim that
Type(G) = Type(G′). The lemma is a corollary of this claim.
Consider the tripartitions ξ(H) = (B1, B2, B3), ξ(H′) = (B′
1, B′
2, B′
3), ξ(G) = (D1, D2, D3), and
ξ(G′) = (D′
1, D′
2, D′
3). We write B0 = V (G) \ V (H) and B′
0 = V (G′) \ V (H′).
Let φ⋆be the natural 1-to-1 correspondence from B0 ∪B1 ∪B2 to B′
0 ∪B′
1 ∪B′
2. Note that
D1 ∪D2 ⊆B0 ∪B1 ∪B2 and D′
1 ∪D′
2 ⊆B′
0 ∪B′
1 ∪B′
2. Also, the 1-to-1 correspondence between
D1 ∪D2 and D′
1 ∪D′
2 given by φ⋆is exactly the 1-to-1 correspondence φ speciﬁed in the requirement
of G ⋆∼G′.
Let L: (D1 ∪D2) →Σout and let L′ be the corresponding output labeling of D′
1 ∪D′
2, under
the 1-to-1 correspondence φ. To show that G ⋆∼G′, all we need to do is show that L is extendible
w.r.t. G if and only if L′ is extendible w.r.t. G′. Since we can also write G = Replace(G′, H′, H), it
suﬃces to show just one direction, i.e., if L is extendible then L′ is extendible.
Suppose L is extendible. Then there exists an output labeling L⋄of G such that (i) for each
v ∈D1 ∪D2, we have L⋄(v) = L(v), and (ii) L⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in D2 ∪D3. Since
D2 ∪D3 ⊇B2 ∪B3, we can apply Lemma 10, which shows that there exists a complete labeling
L′
⋄of G′ such that the two conditions in Lemma 10 are met. We argue that this implies that L′ is
extendible. We verify that (i) L′(v′) = L′
⋄(v′) for each v′ ∈D′
1 ∪D′
2, and (ii) L′
⋄is locally consistent
at all nodes in D′
2 ∪D′
3.
• Condition 1 of Lemma 10 guarantees that L⋄(v) = L′
⋄(φ⋆(v)) for each v ∈(V (G) \ V (H)) ∪
(B1 ∪B2) = B0 ∪B1 ∪B2 and its corresponding node φ⋆(v) ∈B′
0 ∪B′
1 ∪B′
2. Since D′
1 ∪D′
2 ⊆
B′
0 ∪B′
1 ∪B′
2, we have L′(v′) = L′
⋄(v′) for each v′ ∈D′
1 ∪D′
2.
• The fact that L⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in D2 ∪D3, together with Condition 1 in
Lemma 10, guarantees that L′
⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in (D′
2 ∪D′
3) \ B′
3. Condition 2
in Lemma 10 guarantees that L′
⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in B′
2 ∪B′
3. Therefore, L′
⋄is
locally consistent at all nodes in D′
2 ∪D′
3, as required.
The number of types can be upper bounded as follows.
Lemma 13. The number of equivalence classes of ⋆∼(i.e., types) is at most |Σin|4r2|Σout|4r.
Proof. Let P be a directed path, and let ξ(P) = (D1, D2, D3). Then Type(P) is determined by the
following information.
• The input labels in D1 ∪D2. Note that there are at most |Σin|4r possible input labeling of
D1 ∪D2.
• A length-x binary string indicating the extendibility of each possible output labeling of D1∪D2,
where x = |Σout|4r.
Therefore, the number of equivalence classes of ⋆∼is at most |Σin|4r2|Σout|4r.
21

Deﬁne ℓpump as the total number of types. Observe that Lemma 12 implies that Type(P) can be
computed by a ﬁnite automaton whose number of states is the total number of types, which is a
constant independent of P. Thus, we have the following two pumping lemmas which allow us to
extend the length of a given directed path P while preserving the type of P. The following two
lemmas follow from the standard pumping lemma for regular language.
Lemma 14. Let P ∈Σk
in with k ≥ℓpump.
Then P can be decomposed into three substrings
P = x ◦y ◦z such that (i) |xy| ≤ℓpump, (ii) |y| ≥1, and (iii) for each non-negative integer i,
Type(x ◦yi ◦z) = Type(P).
Lemma 15. For each w ∈Σ>0
in , there exist two positive integers a and b such that a + b ≤ℓpump,
and Type(wai+b) is invariant for each non-negative integer i.
4.2
The ω(log∗n)—o(n) Gap
In this section we show that the ω(log∗n)—o(n) gap is decidable. More speciﬁcally, we show that
an LCL problem P can be solved in O(log∗n) rounds if and only if there exists a feasible function,
which is deﬁned as follows.
Input: A directed path P = w1 ◦S ◦w2, where |w1| ∈[ℓpump, ℓpump + 1], |w2| ∈[ℓpump, ℓpump + 1],
and |S| = 2r. The decomposition P = w1 ◦S ◦w2 is considered part of the input.
Output: A string L ∈Σ2r
out that represents the output labeling of S.
Requirement: Any such function f is said to be feasible if the following requirement is met for
any paths S1, S2 and wa, wb, wc, wd such that |S1| = |S2| = 2r and {|wa|, |wb|, |wc|, |wd|} ⊆
[ℓpump, ℓpump + 1]. Let P = wa ◦S1 ◦wb ◦wc ◦S2 ◦wd, and consider the following assignment
of output labels to S1 ∪S2.
• Either label S1 by f(wa ◦S1 ◦wb) or label SR
1 by f(wR
b ◦SR
1 ◦wR
a ).
• Either label S2 by f(wc ◦S2 ◦wd) or label SR
2 by f(wR
d ◦SR
2 ◦wR
c ).
It is required that given such a partial labeling of P, the middle part wb ◦wc can be assigned
output labels in such a way that the labeling of (i) the last r nodes of S1, (ii) all nodes in
wb ◦wc, and (iii) the ﬁrst r nodes of S2 are locally consistent.
The following lemma is a straightforward consequence of the well-known O(log∗n)-round MIS
algorithm on cycles.
Lemma 16. Let G be a cycle graph of n nodes, and let s ≤k be two constant integers such that
s + k ≤n. Then in O(log∗n) rounds we can compute a decomposition V = A ∪B such that each
connected component of A has size s, and each connected component of B has size within [k, k + 1].
Proof. For any given constant integer 1 ≤L < n, we will show that in O(log∗n) time we can ﬁnd
an independent set I of G such that each connected component induced by V \ I has at least L
nodes and at most 2L nodes. Using this result with L = 2(s −1) + k(s + k + 1), it is straightforward
to obtain the desired decomposition V = A ∪B, as follows.
For each v ∈I, it arbitrarily chooses a size-s path Sv that contains v, and all nodes in Sv are
included to A. Now each connected component S′ induced by the remaining nodes is a path of
size at least L −2(s −1) ≥k(s + k + 1) and at most 2L. We will divide the path S′ into subpaths
R1, R2, . . . , Rt meeting the following conditions: (i) if i is odd, then the size of Ri is k or k + 1;
22

--- Page 24 ---
(ii) if i is even, then the size of Ri is s; (iii) t is odd. Hence we obtain the desired decomposition
V = A ∪B if we include the nodes in R1, R3, . . . to B and include the nodes in R2, R4, . . . to A. We
show that such a decomposition of S′ into subpaths R1, R2, . . . , Rt exists. Denote z as the size of
S′. We write z = α(s + k + 1) + β, where α > 0 and 0 ≤β < s + k + 1 are integers. Note that we
must have α ≥k and β ≤2k.
• For the case β ≥k, there is a decomposition R1, R2, . . . , Rt satisﬁes the following conditions:
(i) if i is odd, then the size of Ri is k + 1 when i < t or β when i = t; (ii) if i is even, then the
size of Ri is s; (iii) t = 2α + 1 is odd.
• For the case β < k, there is a decomposition R1, R2, . . . , Rt satisﬁes the following conditions:
(i) if i is odd, then the size of Ri is k when i ∈{1, 3, 5, . . . , 2(k−β)−1}∪{t} or k+1 otherwise;
(ii) if i is even, then the size of Ri is s; (iii) t = 2α + 1 is odd.
For the rest of the proof, we show that in O(log∗n) time we can ﬁnd the required independent
set I. We prove the lemma by an induction on L. The base case of L = 1 is identical to the MIS
problem. Now consider L > 1. By induction hypothesis, we ﬁnd an independent set I′ in O(log∗n)
time such that each connected component induced by V \ I′ has at least L′ nodes and at most 2L′
nodes, where L′ = ⌊L/2⌋. Let G′ be the graph resulting from contracting all nodes in V \ I′, and
we compute an MIS I′′ on this graph G′, which can be done in O(log∗n) rounds in the original
graph G. Note that each connected component S of V \ I′′ has size at least 2L′ + 1 ≥L and at most
3(2L′) + 2. If the size of S is higher than 2L, then we can add some nodes in S to the independent
set I′′ so that the component size of the remaining nodes in S is within [L, 2L].
Lemma 17. If a feasible function f exists, then there is an O(log∗n)-round deterministic LOCAL
algorithm for P on cycles.
Proof. Given that the number of nodes n is at least some large enough constant, in O(log∗n) rounds
we can compute a decomposition V = A ∪B such that each connected component of A has size 2r,
and each connected component of B has size within [2ℓpump, 2ℓpump + 1]. This can be done using
Lemma 16 with s = 2r and k = 2ℓpump. We further decompose each connected component P of
B into two paths P = P1 ◦P2 in such a way that the size of both P1 and P2 are within the range
[ℓpump, ℓpump + 1]. We write P to denote the set of all these paths.
Let S be a connected component of A, and let w1 and w2 be its two neighboring paths in P so
that (w1 ◦S ◦w2) is a subpath of the underlying graph G. The output labels of S are assigned either
by labeling S with f(w1 ◦S ◦w2) or by labeling SR with f(wR
2 ◦SR ◦wR
1 ). At this moment, all
components of A have been assigned output labels using f. By the feasibility of f, each connected
component of B is able to label itself output labels in such a way that the labeling of all nodes are
locally consistent.
Lemma 18. If there is an o(n)-round deterministic LOCAL algorithm A for P on cycles, then a
feasible function f exists.
Proof. Fix s to be some suﬃciently large number, and ﬁx n = 8(s + ℓpump) + 2(2r). We select s to
be large enough so that the runtime of A is smaller than 0.1s. For any given directed path w with
|w| ∈[ℓpump, ℓpump + 1], we ﬁx w+ as the result of applying the pumping lemma (Lemma 14) on w
so that the following two conditions are met: (i) |w+| ∈[s, s + ℓpump] and (ii) Type(w) = Type(w+).

Constructing a Feasible Function f by Simulating A.
The function f(w1 ◦S ◦w2) is
constructed by simulating a given o(n)-round deterministic LOCAL algorithm for P. The output
labeling given by f(w1 ◦S ◦w2) is exactly the result of simulating A on the path P = w+
1 ◦S ◦w+
2
while assuming the number of nodes of the underlying graph is n. Remember that the round
complexity of A is o(n) on n-node graphs. By setting s to be large enough, the runtime of A can be
made smaller than 0.1s. Thus, the calculation of f(w1 ◦S ◦w2) only depends on the IDs and the
input labels of (i) the last 0.1s nodes in w+
1 , (ii) all nodes in S, and (iii) the ﬁrst 0.1s nodes in w+
2 .
In the calculation of f(w1 ◦S ◦w2), the IDs of the nodes that participate in the simulation of A are
chosen arbitrarily so long as they are distinct.
Feasibility of f.
Now we verify that the function f constructed above is feasible. Consider any
choices of paths S1, S2 and wa, wb, wc, wd such that |S1| = |S2| = 2r and {|wa|, |wb|, |wc|, |wd|} ⊆
[ℓpump, ℓpump + 1]. Deﬁne P = wa ◦S1 ◦wb ◦wc ◦S2 ◦wd, and let G be the cycle graph formed by
connecting the two ends of the path P. To show that f is feasible, we need to consider the following
four ways of assigning output labels to S1 ∪S2.
1. Label S1 by f(wa ◦S1 ◦wb); label S2 by f(wc ◦S2 ◦wd).
2. Label S1 by f(wa ◦S1 ◦wb); label SR
2 by f(wR
d ◦SR
2 ◦wR
c ).
3. Label SR
1 by f(wR
b ◦SR
1 ◦wR
a ); label S2 by f(wc ◦S2 ◦wd).
4. Label SR
1 by f(wR
b ◦SR
1 ◦wR
a ); label SR
2 by f(wR
d ◦SR
2 ◦wR
c ).
For each of the above four partial labelings of P, we need to show that the middle part wb ◦wc
can still be assigned output labels in such a way that the labeling of (i) the last r nodes of S1, (ii)
all nodes in wb ◦wc, and (iii) the ﬁrst r nodes of S2 are locally consistent.
Proof of the First Case.
In what follows, we focus on the ﬁrst case, i.e., the partial labeling is
given by labeling S1 by f(wa ◦S1 ◦wb) and labeling S2 by f(wc ◦S2 ◦wd); the proof for the other
three cases are analogous. In this case, we deﬁne P ′ = w+
a ◦S1 ◦w+
b ◦w+
c ◦S2 ◦w+
d , and let G′ be
the cycle graph formed by connecting the two ends of P ′. Note that the number of nodes in G′ is at
most 8(s + ℓpump) + 2(2r) = n. All we need to do is to ﬁnd an output labeling L of G such that the
following conditions are satisﬁed.
(a) The output labels of S1 is given by f(wa ◦S1 ◦wb).
(b) The output labels of S2 is given by f(wc ◦S2 ◦wd).
(c) The labeling of (i) the last r nodes of S1, (ii) all nodes in wb ◦wc, and (iii) the ﬁrst r nodes of
S2 are locally consistent.
We ﬁrst generate an output labeling L′ of G′ by executing A on G′ under the following ID
assignment. The IDs of (i) the last 0.1s nodes in w+
a , (ii) all nodes in S1, and (iii) the ﬁrst 0.1s
nodes in w+
b are chosen as the ones used in the deﬁnition of f(wa ◦S1 ◦wb). Similarly, the IDs of (i)
the last 0.1s nodes in w+
c , (ii) all nodes in S2, and (iii) the ﬁrst 0.1s nodes in w+
d are chosen as the
ones used in the deﬁnition of f(wc ◦S2 ◦wd). The IDs of the rest of the nodes are chosen arbitrarily
so long as when we run A on G′, no node sees two nodes with the same ID. Due to the way we
deﬁne f, the output labeling L′ of the subpath S1 is exactly given by f(wa ◦S1 ◦wb), and the output
labeling L′ of S2 is exactly f(wc ◦S2 ◦wd). Due to the correctness of A, L′ is a legal labeling.
We transform the output labeling L′ of G′ to a desired output labeling L of G. Remember that
G is the result of replacing the four subpaths w+ of G′ by w, and we have Type(w+) = Type(w). In
view of Lemma 11, there is a legal labeling L of G such that all nodes in S1 and S2 are labeled the
same as in G′. Therefore, the labeling L satisﬁes the above three conditions (a), (b), and (c).
24

--- Page 26 ---
The Other Cases.
We brieﬂy discuss how we modify the proof to deal with the other three
cases. For example, consider the second case, where the partial labeling is given by labeling S1 by
f(wa ◦S1 ◦wb) and labeling SR
2 by f(wR
d ◦SR
2 ◦wR
c ). In this case, the path P ′ is deﬁned as
P ′ = w+
a ◦S1 ◦w+
b ◦
 (wR
c )+R ◦SR
2 ◦
 (wR
d )+R .
During the ID assignment of G′, the IDs of (i) the last 0.1s nodes in w+
c , (ii) all nodes in S2, and
(iii) the ﬁrst 0.1s nodes in w+
d are now chosen as the ones used in the deﬁnition of f(wR
d ◦SR
2 ◦wR
c ).
Using such an ID assignment, the output labeling L′ of SR
2 as the result of executing A on G′ will
be exactly the same as the output labeling given by f(wR
d ◦SR
2 ◦wR
c ). The rest of the proof is the
same.
Theorem 8 follows from the above two lemmas. The decidability result is due to the simple
observation that whether a feasible function exists is decidable.
4.3
Partitioning a Cycle
In the following sections, we prove the decidability result associated with the ω(1)—o(log∗n) gap.
In this proof, we also deﬁne a feasible function, prove its decidability, and show the existence given
an o(log∗n)-time algorithm. The main challenge here is that an MIS cannot be computed in O(1)
time. To solve this issue, we decompose a cycle into paths with unrepetitive patterns and paths
with repetitive patterns. For paths with unrepetitive patterns, we are able to compute a suﬃciently
well-spaced MIS in O(1) time by making use of the irregularity of the input patterns.
Section 4.3 considers an O(1)-round algorithm that partitions a cycle into some short paths
and some paths that have a repeated input pattern. Section 4.4 deﬁnes a feasible function whose
existence characterizes the O(1)-round solvable LCL problems. In Section 4.5, we prove Theorem 9.
Partitioning an Undirected Cycle into Directed Paths.
Let G be a cycle graph.
An
orientation of a node v is an assignment to one of its neighbor, this can be speciﬁed using port-
numbering. An orientation of the nodes in G is called ℓ-orientation if the following condition is met.
If |V (G)| ≤ℓ, then all nodes in G are oriented to the same direction. If |V (G)| > ℓ, then each node
v ∈V (G) belongs to a path P such that (i) all nodes in P are oriented to the same direction, and
(ii) the number of nodes in P is at least ℓ. In O(1) rounds we can compute an ℓ-orientation of G for
any constant ℓ.
Lemma 19 ([6]). Let G be a cycle graph. Let ℓbe a constant. There is a deterministic LOCAL
algorithm that computes an ℓ-orientation of G in O(1) rounds.
In this section, we will use a generalization of an ℓ-orientation that satisﬁes an additional
requirement that the input labels of each directed path P in the decomposition with |V (P)| > 2ℓwidth
(where 2ℓwidth is a threshold) must form a periodic string (whose period length is at most ℓpattern).
A string w ∈Σ∗
in is called primitive if w cannot be written as xi for some x ∈Σ∗
in and i ≥2. Let
G be a cycle graph or a path graph where each node v ∈V (G) has an input label from Σin. We
deﬁne an (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition as a partition of G into a set of connected subgraphs P
meeting the following criteria. We assume |V (G)| > 2ℓwidth and ℓpattern ≥ℓwidth.
Direction and Minimum Length: For each P ∈P, the nodes in P are oriented to the same
direction, and |V (P)| ≥ℓwidth.
25

--- Page 27 ---
Short Paths: Deﬁne Pshort as the subset of P that contains paths having at most 2ℓwidth
nodes. For each directed path P = (v1, . . . , vk) ∈Pshort, each node vi in P knows its rank i.
Long Paths: Deﬁne Plong = P \ Pshort. Then the input labeling of the nodes in P is of the
form wk for some primitive string w ∈Σ∗
in such that |w| ≤ℓpattern and k ≥ℓcount. Moreover,
each node v in P knows the string w.
Note that P may contain a cycle. This is possible only when G is a cycle where the input
labeling is a repetition (at least ℓcount times) of a primitive string w ∈Σ∗
in of length at most ℓpattern.
In this case, we must have P = Plong = {G}. Otherwise, P contains only paths.
The goal of this section is to show that an (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition can be found in O(1)
rounds. First of all, in Lemma 20 we demonstrate how we can break symmetry in O(1) rounds
given that the underlying graph is directed and the input labels does not form long periodic strings.
Let G be a path or a cycle. A set I ⊆V (G) is called an (α, β)-independent set if the following
conditions are met: (i) I is an independent set, and I does not contain either endpoint of G (if G is
a path), and (ii) each connected component induced by V \ I has at least α nodes and at most β
nodes, unless |V | ≤α, in which case we allow I = ∅. Note that ﬁnding an (α, β)-independent set
takes O(log∗n) rounds in general, but in Lemma 20 we show that by leveraging the “irregularity”
of input labels, we can do this in O(1) rounds on directed paths or cycles without periodic patterns.
Lemma 20. Let γ and ℓbe any two constants with ℓ≥γ. Let G be a directed cycle or a directed
path that does not contain any subpath of the form wx, with |w| ≤γ and |wx| ≥ℓ. There is a
deterministic LOCAL algorithm that computes an (γ, 2γ)-independent set I of G in O(1) rounds.
Proof. For the case G is a directed path P = (s, . . . , t), deﬁne V ′ as the set of nodes in G whose
distance to t is at least ℓ−1. For the case G is a directed cycle, deﬁne V ′ = V (G). In what follows,
we focus on ﬁnding an (γ, 2γ)-independent set I′ of the nodes in V ′. Extending the set I′ to produce
the desired independent set I can be done with extra O(1) rounds.
Recall that G is directed. Deﬁne the color of a node v ∈V ′ by the sequence of the ℓinput labels
of v and the ℓ−1 nodes following v in G. For each node v ∈V ′, there is no other node within
distance γ to v having the same color as v, since otherwise we can ﬁnd a subpath whose input labels
form a string wx, with |w| ≤γ and |wx| ≥ℓ. By applying the standard procedure that computes an
MIS from a coloring, within O(1) rounds a (γ, 2γ)-independent set I′ can be obtained.
Using Lemma 20, we ﬁrst show that an (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition can be found in O(1)
rounds for the case G is directed. That is, all nodes in G are initially oriented to the same direction,
and we are allowed to re-orient the nodes.
Lemma 21. Let G be a directed cycle or a directed path where each node v ∈V (G) has an input label
from Σin, and |V (G)| > 2ℓwidth. Let ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern be three constants such that ℓpattern ≥ℓwidth.
There is a deterministic LOCAL algorithm that computes an (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition in O(1)
rounds
Proof. Let (w1, w2, . . . , wk) be any ordering of the primitive strings in Σ∗
in of length at most ℓpattern.
First, construct a set of subgraphs Plong as follows. Initialize U = V (G) and Plong = ∅. For i = 1 to
k, execute the following procedure. Let Si be the set of maximal-size connected subgraphs formed by
nodes in U such that the input labels form the string wx
i with x ≥ℓcount + 2ℓwidth. Each node v ∈U
in O(1) rounds checks if v belongs to a subgraph in Si; if so, remove v from U. For each P ∈Si,
26

--- Page 28 ---
deﬁne P ′ as follows. If P is a cycle, then P ′ = P. If P is a path, then P ′ is the result of removing
all nodes that are within distance ℓwidth|wi| −1 to an endpoint in P. Note that each node v in P
knows whether v belongs to P ′. Deﬁne S′
i = {P ′|P ∈Si}, and then update Plong ←Plong ∪S′
i.
It is straightforward to verify that each path or cycle P ∈Plong satisﬁes the requirement in the
deﬁnition of (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition. Deﬁne the set of subgraphs Pirreg as the connected
components of the nodes not in any subgraph in Plong. Deﬁne ℓ= (ℓpattern + 2ℓwidth) · ℓcount. By
our construction, the input labeling in each subgraph P ∈Pirreg does not contain any substring
wx, with 1 ≤|w| ≤ℓpattern and |wx| ≥ℓ. An (ℓpattern, 2ℓpattern)-independent set of each P ∈Pirreg
can be computed using Lemma 20 in O(1) rounds. Observe that each subgraph P ∈Pirreg has at
least ℓwidth nodes. Given an (ℓpattern, 2ℓpattern)-independent set of a subgraph P ∈Pirreg, in O(1)
rounds P can be partitioned into subpaths, each of which contains at least ℓpattern nodes and at
most 2ℓpattern nodes. This ﬁnishes the construction of an (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition.
Combining Lemma 21 and Lemma 19, we are able to construct an (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition
in O(1) rounds for undirected graphs.
Lemma 22. Let G be a cycle or a path where each node v ∈V (G) has an input label from Σin, and
|V (G)| > 2ℓwidth. Let ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern be three constants such that ℓpattern ≥ℓwidth. There is a
deterministic LOCAL algorithm that computes an (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition in O(1) rounds
Proof. The algorithm is as follows. Compute an ℓ-orientation of G by Lemma 19 in O(1) rounds
with ℓ= 2ℓwidth + 1. For each maximal-length connected subgraph P where each constituent node
is oriented to the same direction, ﬁnd an (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition of P in O(1) rounds by
Lemma 21.
4.4
Feasible Function
The goal of this section is to deﬁne a feasible function whose existence characterizes the O(1)-round
solvable LCL problems. With respect to an LCL problem P and a function f which takes a string
w ∈Σk
in with 1 ≤k ≤ℓpump as input, and returns a string f(w) ∈Σk
out, we deﬁne some partially or
completely labeled path graphs which are used in the deﬁnition of a feasible function.
Completely Labeled Graph Gw,z: Let w ∈Σ∗
in be any string of length at least 1 and at most
ℓpump. Let z be any non-negative integer. Deﬁne Gw,z = (Gw,z, L) as follows. The graph Gw,z
is a path of the form wr ◦wz ◦wr. The labeling L is a complete labeling of the form f(w)z+2r.
Deﬁne Mid(Gw,z) as the middle subpath wz of Gw,z.
Partially Labeled Graph Gw1,w2,S: Let w1, w2 ∈Σ∗
in be any two strings of length at least 1 and
at most ℓpump. Let S ∈Σ∗
in be any string (can be empty). Deﬁne Gw1,w2,S = (Gw1,w2,S, L) as
follows. The graph Gw1,w2,S is the path of the form wℓpump+2r
1
◦S ◦wℓpump+2r
2
. The labeling
L is a partial labeling of Gw1,w2,S which ﬁxes the output labels of the ﬁrst 2r|w1| and the
last 2r|w2| nodes by f(w1)2r and f(w2)2r, respectively. Deﬁne Mid(Gw1,w2,S) as the middle
subpath wℓpump+r
1
◦S ◦wℓpump+r
2
of Gw1,w2,S.
Feasible Function: We call f a feasible function if the following conditions are met: (i) For each
Gw,z = (Gw,z, L), the complete labeling L is locally consistent at all nodes in Mid(Gw,z). (ii)
Each partially labeled graph Gw1,w2,S admits a complete labeling L⋄that is locally consistent
at all nodes in Mid(Gw1,w2,S).
Lemma 23. Given an LCL problem P on cycle graphs. It is decidable whether there is a feasible
function.
27

--- Page 29 ---
Proof. Note that it is not immediate from its deﬁnition as to whether a feasible function exists is
decidable, since there appears to be inﬁnitely many graphs Gw,z and Gw1,w2,S needed to be examined.
However, the following simple observations show that it suﬃces to check only a constant number of
these graphs.
• If the complete labeling L of Gw,1 = (Gw,1, L) is locally consistent at all nodes in Mid(Gw,1),
then for all z ≥1, the complete labeling L of Gw,z = (Gw,z, L) is also locally consistent at all
nodes in Mid(Gw,z).
• If Gw1,w2,S admits a complete labeling L⋄that is locally consistent at all nodes in Mid(Gw1,w2,S),
then for each S′ such that Type(S) = Type(S′), the partially labeled graph Gw1,w2,S′ also
admits a complete labeling L⋄that is locally consistent at all nodes in Mid(Gw1,w2,S′). This is
due to Lemma 11.
Therefore, to decide whether a function f is feasible, we only need to check all possible Gw,z and
Gw1,w2,S. For each w we only need to consider the graph Gw,z with z = 1. For each w1 and w2, we
do not need to go over all S; we only need to consider (i) the empty string S = ∅, and (ii) for each
type τ, a string S ∈Σ∗
in such that Type(S) = τ. By Lemma 14, for each type τ, there exists P ∈Σx
in
with x ≤ℓpump such that Type(P) = τ. Therefore, a string S with Type(S) = τ can be found in
bounded amount of time; also note that the number of types is bounded; see Lemma 13.
For the rest of this section, we show that as long as the deterministic LOCAL complexity of
P is o(log∗n) on cycle graphs, there exists a feasible function f. In Lemma 24 we show how to
extract a function f from a given o(log∗n)-round deterministic LOCAL algorithm A, and then in
Lemma 25 we prove that such a function f is feasible. Intuitively, Lemma 24 shows that there exists
an ID-assignment such that when we run A on a subpath whose input labeling is a repetition of a
length-k pattern w, the output labeling is also a repetition of a length-k pattern w′. The function f
will be deﬁned as f(w) = w′.
Lemma 24. Let A be any deterministic LOCAL algorithm that solves P in t(n) = o(log∗n) rounds.
Then there is a number n′ and function f which takes a string w ∈Σk
in with 1 ≤k ≤ℓpump as input,
and returns a string f(w) ∈Σk
out meeting the following condition. For any P = wi ◦w2r+1 ◦wi such
that |wi| ≥t(n′) and 1 ≤|w| ≤ℓpump, there is an assignment of distinct Θ(log n′)-bit IDs to the
nodes in P such that the following is true. Simulating A on P while assuming that the total number
of nodes in the underlying graph is n′ yields the output labeling f(w)2r+1 for the middle subpath
w2r+1.
Proof. In this proof we assume that there is no such a number n′. Then we claim that using A it is
possible to obtain a deterministic LOCAL algorithm for MIS on an n-node directed cycle G without
input labeling, in O(t(n)) + O(1) = o(log∗n) rounds. This contradicts the well-known Ω(log∗n)
lower bound for MIS [20].
Let G be an n-node directed cycle without input labeling. The MIS algorithm on G is described
as follows. Let w ∈Σk
in with 1 ≤k ≤ℓpump be chosen such that for any function f, the string
f(w) ∈Σk
out does not satisfy the conditions stated in the lemma for the number n′ = nk. Deﬁne
G′ as the graph resulting from replacing each node v ∈V (G) with a path w. We can simulate the
imaginary graph G′ in the communication network G by letting each node v ∈V (G) simulate a
path w.
We execute the algorithm A on G′ while assuming that the total number of nodes is n′. The
execution takes t(n′) = O(t(n)) rounds. For each node v ∈V (G), deﬁne the color of v as the
sequence of the output labels of the path w2r simulated by the node v and the 2r −1 nodes following
28

--- Page 30 ---
v in the directed cycle G. This gives us a proper O(1)-coloring, since otherwise there must exist
a subpath P = w2r+1 of G′ such that the output labeling of P is of the form y2r+1 for some y,
contradicting our choice of w. Using the standard procedure of computing an MIS from a coloring,
with extra O(1) rounds, an MIS of G can be obtained.
Note that there is a subtle issue about how we set the IDs of nodes in V (G′). The following
method is guaranteed to output distinct IDs. Let v ∈V (G), and let u1, . . . , uk be the nodes in
V (G′) simulated by v. Then we may use ID(ui) = k · ID(v) + i.
Lemma 25. Suppose that the deterministic LOCAL complexity of P is o(log∗n) on cycle graphs.
Then there exists a feasible function f.
Proof. Let A be any deterministic LOCAL algorithm that solves P in t(n) = o(log∗n) rounds. Let
n′ and f be chosen to meet the conditions in Lemma 24 for A. The goal of the proof is to show
that f is a feasible function. According to the conditions speciﬁed in Lemma 24 for the function f,
we already know that the complete labeling L of each Gw,z = (Gw,z, L) is locally consistent at all
nodes in Mid(Gw,z). Therefore, all we need to do is the following. For each partially labeled graph
Gw1,w2,S, ﬁnd a complete labeling L⋄that is locally consistent at all nodes in Mid(Gw1,w2,S).
Given the three parameters w1, w2, and S, deﬁne G as the cycle resulting from linking the
two ends of the path wℓpump
1
◦w2r+1
1
◦wℓpump
1
◦S ◦wℓpump
2
◦w2r+1
2
◦wℓpump
2
. Deﬁne L as the partial
labeling of G which ﬁxes the output labeling of the two subpaths w2r+1
1
and w2r+1
2
by f(w1)2r+1
and f(w2)2r+1, respectively. We write P mid
1
and P mid
2
to denote the two subpaths w2r+1
1
and w2r+1
2
,
respectively.
In what follows, we show that the partially labeled graph G = (G, L) admits a legal labeling L⋄.
Since Gw1,w2,S is a subgraph of G = (G, L), such a legal labeling L⋄is also a complete labeling of
Gw1,w2,S that is locally consistent at all nodes in Mid(Gw1,w2,S).
For the rest of the proof, we show the existence of L⋄. This will be established by applying a
pumping lemma. Deﬁne the graph G′ as the result of the following operations on G.
• Replace the two subpaths wℓpump
1
by wx
1, where the number x is chosen such that x|w1| ≥
2t(n′) + r, and Type(wℓpump
1
) = Type(wx
1).
• Replace the two subpaths wℓpump
2
by wy
2, where the number y is chosen such that y|w2| ≥
2t(n′) + r, and Type(wℓpump
2
) = Type(wy
2).
The existence of the numbers x and y above is guaranteed by Lemma 15. The IDs of nodes in G′ are
assigned as follows. For i = 1, 2, select the IDs of the nodes in S
v∈P mid
i
Nt(n′)(v) in such a way that
the output labeling of P mid
i
resulting from executing A on G′ while assuming that the total number
of nodes is n′ is f(wi)2r+1. The existence of such an ID assignment is guaranteed by Lemma 24. For
all remaining nodes in G′, select their IDs in such a way that all nodes in Nr+t(n′)(v) receive distinct
IDs, for each v ∈V (G′). This ensures that the outcome of executing A on G′ while assuming that
the total number of nodes is n′ is a legal labeling.
Let L′
⋄be the legal labeling of G′ resulting from executing A with the above IDs while pretending
that the total number of nodes is n′. Note that L′
⋄must label P mid
1
and P mid
2
by f(w1)2r+1 and
f(w2)2r+1, respectively. A desired legal labeling L⋄of G can be obtained from the legal labeling L′
⋄of
G′ by applying Lemma 11, as we have Type(wℓpump
1
) = Type(wx
1) and Type(wℓpump
2
) = Type(wy
2).
4.5
The ω(1)—o(log∗n) Gap
In this section we prove that it is decidable whether a given LCL problem P has complexity Ω(log∗n)
or O(1) on cycle graphs.
29

--- Page 31 ---
Lemma 26. Let f be any feasible function. Let G be any cycle graph. Let P be any set of
disjoint subgraphs in G such that the input labeling of each P ∈P is of the form wx such that
x ≥2ℓpump + 2r, and w ∈Σk
in is a string with 1 ≤k ≤ℓpump. For each P ∈P, deﬁne the subgraph
P ′ as follows. If P is a cycle, deﬁne P ′ = P. If P is a path, write P = wℓpump ◦wi ◦wℓpump, and
deﬁne P ′ as the middle subpath wi. Let L be a partial labeling of G deﬁned as follows. For each
P = wx ∈P, ﬁx the output labels of each subpath w of P ′ by f(w). Then G = (G, L) admits a legal
labeling L⋄.
Proof. Deﬁne V1 as the set of all nodes such that v ∈V1 if v belongs to the middle subpath wj
of some path P = wℓpump ◦wr ◦wj ◦wr ◦wℓpump ∈P. By the deﬁnition of feasible function, L is
already locally consistent at all nodes in V1. Thus, all we need to do is to construct a complete
labeling L⋄of G = (G, L), and argue that L⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in V2 = V (G) \ V1.
There are two easy special cases. If P = ∅, then no output label of any node in G is ﬁxed, and
so G trivially admits a legal labeling. If P contains a cycle, then P = {G}, and hence L is already
a legal labeling as V1 = V (G).
In subsequent discussion, we restrict ourselves to the case that P is non-empty and contains only
paths. The output labeling L⋄is constructed as follows. Deﬁne Punlabeled as the maximal-length
subpaths of G that are not assigned any output labels by L. A path P ∈Punlabeled must be of the
form wℓpump

◦S ◦wℓpump
2
, where w1, w2 ∈Σ∗
in are two strings of length at least 1 and at most ℓpump,
and S ∈Σ∗
in can be any string (including the empty string). Given P ∈Punlabeled, we make the
following deﬁnitions.
• Deﬁne P + as the subpath of G that includes P and the r|w1| nodes preceding P, and the
r|w2| nodes following P in the graph G. Note that the set V2 is exactly the union of nodes in
P + for all P ∈Punlabeled.
• Deﬁne P ++ as the subpath of G that includes P and the 2r|w1| nodes preceding P, and the
2r|w2| nodes following P in the graph G. The path P ++ must be of the form wℓpump+2r
1
◦S ◦
wℓpump+2r
2
, and the labeling L already ﬁxes the output labels of the ﬁrst 2r|w1| and the last
2r|w2| nodes of P ++ by f(w1)2r and f(w2)2r, respectively.
Observe that the path P ++ = wℓpump+2r

◦S ◦wℓpump+2r

together with the labeling L is exactly the
partially labeled graph Gw1,w2,S. We assign the output labels to the nodes in P by the labeling
L⋄guaranteed in the deﬁnition of feasible function. It is ensured that the labeling of all nodes
within P + are locally consistent. By doing so for each P ∈Punlabeled, we obtain a desired complete
labeling that is locally consistent at all nodes in V2.
Lemma 27. Suppose that there is a feasible function f for the LCL problem P. Then there is an
O(1)-round deterministic LOCAL algorithm A on cycle graphs.
Proof. The ﬁrst step of the algorithm A is to compute an (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition in O(1)
rounds by Lemma 22. We set ℓcount = 2ℓpump + 2r and ℓwidth = ℓpattern = ℓpump. We assume
|V (G)| > 2ℓwidth. Recall that an (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition decomposes the cycle G into two
sets of disjoint subgraphs Pshort and Plong.
Deﬁne G′ as the graph resulting from applying the following operations on G.
For each
P ∈Pshort, replace the path P by the path P ∗= x ◦yi ◦z such that i = ℓcount, 1 ≤|y| ≤ℓpattern,
and the type of P ∗is the same as the type of P. The path P ∗is obtained via Lemma 14. Note that
each path P ∈Pshort has at least ℓwidth = ℓpump nodes and at most 2ℓwidth = 2ℓpump nodes. Deﬁne
P∗as the set of all P ∗such that P ∈Pshort. The graph G′ is simulated in the communication
graph G by electing a leader for each path P ∈Pshort to simulate P ∗.

Figure 5: Illustration of Lemma 27.
Calculate a partial labeling L′ of G′ using the feasible function f as follows. Recall ℓcount =
2ℓpump + 2r. For each P ∗= x ◦yℓpump ◦y2r ◦yℓpump ◦z ∈P∗, label the middle subpath y2r by the
function f. For each P = wℓpump ◦wi ◦wℓpump ∈Plong, label the middle subpath wi by f(w)i. Even
though a path P ∈Plong can have ω(1) nodes, this step can be done locally in O(1) rounds due to
the following property of (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition. All nodes in a path P ∈Plong agree with
the same direction and know the primitive string w.
By Lemma 26, the remaining unlabeled nodes in G′ can be labeled to yield a legal labeling of
G′. This can be done in O(1) rounds since the connected components formed by unlabeled nodes
have at most O(1) nodes. Given any valid labeling of G′, a legal labeling of G can be obtained by
applying Lemma 11 in O(1) rounds. Remember that Type(P) = Type(P ∗) for each P ∈Pshort, and
G′ is exactly the result of replacing each P ∈Pshort by P ∗.
See Figure 5 for an illustration of Lemma 27: (1) applying a pumping lemma to extend each
path P ∈Pshort; (2) labeling the middle subpath y2r of P ∗= x ◦yℓpump ◦y2r ◦yℓpump ◦z ∈P∗and
the middle subpath wj of P ′ = wℓpump ◦wi ◦wℓpump ∈Plong by the function f; (3) the remaining
unlabeled nodes in G′ can be labeled to yield a legal labeling of G′ by Lemma 26; (4) since
Type(P) = Type(P ∗) for each P ∈Pshort, we can recover a legal labeling of G by re-labeling nodes
in each P ∈Pshort.
Combining Lemma 23, Lemma 25, and Lemma 27, we have proved Theorem 9. That is, for any
LCL problem P on cycle graphs, its deterministic LOCAL complexity is either Ω(log∗n) or O(1).
Moreover, there is an algorithm that decides whether P has complexity Ω(log∗n) or O(1) on cycle
graphs; for the case the complexity is O(1), the algorithm outputs a description of an O(1)-round
deterministic LOCAL algorithm that solves P.

Deciding Feasible-Function Existence for
β-Normalized, Radius-1 LCLs on Directed Paths is
in NEXPTIME
Abstract
We give a nondeterministic 2poly(β)-time algorithm that decides,
for a β-normalized, radius-1 LCL on globally oriented paths, whether
there exists a feasible function. This decides both gaps O(log∗n) vs.
Θ(n) (mid-consistency) and O(1) vs. Ω(log∗n) (bridging). Our proof
is self-contained modulo standard pumping/replacement facts for path
types; we restate the exact type bound, give a finite-checks lemma with
an explicit z-bound Z ≤ℓ2
pump, spell out the DP used by the verifier
(with boundary handling and tight O(kβ2) complexity), and prove
soundness/completeness. We use Section 4 and Lemmas 10–15, 11, 12,
as well as Theorems 8–9 from the reference.1
1
Model and Normalization (r=1)
We work on globally oriented paths. A β-normalized LCL is given by
Σin = {0, 1},
|Σout| = β,
Cin–out ⊆Σin × Σout,
Cout–out ⊆Σout × Σout,
and a labeling is legal iff (in(v), out(v)) ∈Cin–out for each node v and
(out(u), out(v)) ∈Cout–out for each directed edge u →v. The input size is
N = poly(β).
Types and pumping for r = 1.
For a path P = (u1, . . . , uk) with k ≥4,
define B1 = {u1, uk} and B2 = {u2, uk−1}. Two paths are type-equivalent if
1All background references (lemmas, constructions, and the two gap theorems) refer to
the uploaded PDF: The distributed complexity of locally checkable problems on paths is
decidable. See Section 4 (pp. 19–32), especially Lemmas 10–15 (types/pumping), Lemma 11
(replacement), Lemma 12 (type composition), and Theorems 8–9 (gap characterizations).

(i) inputs on B1 ∪B2 match and (ii) the same boundary-output assignments
on B1 ∪B2 are extendible. Let Type(P) be the type. Counting: there are
24 choices for boundary inputs and a yes/no choice for each of β4 boundary-
output 4-tuples, so
M := |{Type(P)}| ≤24 · 2β4 = 2β4+4 = 2Θ(β4).
Set ℓpump := M. The DFA view of types and pumping/replacement lemmas
are in Section 4: Lemma 12 (type composition), Lemmas 10–11 (replacement),
and Lemmas 14–15 (pumping/periodicity).2
2
Contexts and Feasible Functions (no circularity)
Fix ℓpump. A context is any triple (w1, S, w2) with |w1|, |w2| ∈{ℓpump, ℓpump+1}
and S ∈Σ2
in. We identify contexts by the type of the concatenation w1Sw2.
Thus the set C of context types is a subset of the global type space, indepen-
dent of f.
Definition 1 (Feasible function). A map f : C →Σ2
out is feasible if:
• (F1) Mid-consistency. For any contexts waS1wb and wcS2wd, the
fixed outputs f(Type(waS1wb)) on S1 and f(Type(wcS2wd)) on S2
extend to a legal labeling of waS1 wbwc S2wd.
• (F2) Bridging. For any context (w1, S, w2) and all z ≥1, the fixed
outputs f(Type(w1Sw2)) on S extend to a legal labeling of wz
1Swz
2.
These are precisely the certificates that characterize the two gaps on cy-
cles/paths: (F1) ⇔O(log∗n) vs. Θ(n), and (F1)+(F2) ⇔O(1) vs. Ω(log∗n).3

a, b > 0 with a + b ≤ℓpump such that Type(wat+b) is independent of t ≥0.4
Why: consider the finite set of types T , |T | = ℓpump, and the self-map
Fw : T →T that composes by w. The sequence Ti := F i
w(T0) (here T0 is the
type of the empty prefix) has a repetition Tp = Tq with 1 ≤p < q ≤ℓpump;
setting a = q −p, b = p gives a + b = q ≤ℓpump and Tat+b constant for all
t ≥0. This is the standard orbit argument behind Lemma 15.
Lemma 1 (Finite z for bridging). Fix a context (w1, S, w2). There exist
parameters (ai, bi) for wi with ai+bi ≤ℓpump such that Type(wait+bi
i
) is t-
invariant. Hence the pair
 Type(wz
1), Type(wz
2)

takes at most a1a2 ≤ℓ2
pump
distinct values, and by type composition (Lemma 12) Type(wz
1Swz
2) also takes
at most ℓ2
pump values. Consequently, there exists Z ≤ℓ2
pump with
∀z ≥1 ∃z′ ∈{1, . . . , Z} : Type(wz
1Swz
2) = Type(wz′
1 Swz′
2 ).
Thus (F2) holds iff the partial outputs on S extend for all z ∈{1, . . . , Z}.
Proof. Apply Lemma 15 to each wi (periodicity), and use Lemma 12 (type
composition) to conclude that the type of wz
1Swz
2 is determined by the pair
of side types, whence the bound by pigeonhole. Extendibility depends only
on the resulting type and the fixed outputs on S (by the replacement lemma,
Lemma 11), so a single representative per type suffice.5
How we pick Z in practice.
We will use the worst-case bound Z = ℓ2
pump;
this keeps the algorithm simple and does not affect the asymptotic bound.
(Optional refinement: for a fixed context, compute the cycle structure of
Fw1 and Fw2 in the type DFA and set Z to the lcm of periods times the
max preperiod—still ≤ℓ2
pump—which can reduce constants while remaining
2poly(β) overall.)

Deterministic DP for extendibility (with precise
complexity)
All checks reduce to deciding if a partially labeled path admits a completion.

Layered automaton.
Given a path P = (v1, . . . , vk) and a set F of forced
positions with outputs oi ∈Σout, build k layers, one per position. Layer i
keeps the set
Li := {x ∈Σout : ( in(vi), x ) ∈Cin–out and if i ∈F, x = oi}.
Insert a directed edge x →y from layer i to i+1 iff (x, y) ∈Cout–out. There
is a legal completion iff the layered graph has a path from some state in layer
1 to some state in layer k.
Running time and memory.
Let k = |P|. Constructing layers and edges
takes O(k · |Cout–out|) time, which is O(kβ2) in the worst case, and O(kβ)
memory. Forced nodes reduce the number of states (they do not increase
complexity): the check is a standard reachability on this DAG, also in O(kβ2)
time.
5
Nondeterministic algorithm and correctness
Precomputation (deterministic, 2poly(β))
1. Enumerate all types T by exploring the boundary-extendibility DFA
(Lemma 12), set ℓpump = |T | ≤2Θ(β4).6
2. For each type t ∈T and each boundary assignment on B1 ∪B2, pre-
compute extendible? via DP on a fixed representative of type t (length
O(ℓpump)).
3. Compute the set C ⊆T of context types: those realized by some w1Sw2
with |wi| ∈{ℓpump, ℓpump+1} and |S| = 2. Note |C| ≤ℓpump.
Guess
Nondeterministically guess f(τ) ∈Σ2
out for every τ ∈C.
Verify (deterministic, 2poly(β))
(V1) Mid-consistency. For each ordered pair of contexts (waS1wb, wcS2wd), run the DP on
waS1 wbwc S2wd with the two 2-node windows S1, S2 forced to f; accept
only if the DP succeeds. Why no extra buffers: by definition of contexts,
6Type DFA and counting bound: Lemma 13 (p. 22) specialized to r=1 gives |T | ≤24·2β4.

wb, wc each has length ℓpump or ℓpump+1, so the underlined bridge wbwc
is already a long buffer for the replacement lemmas.
(V2) Bridging. For each context (w1, S, w2) and each z = 1, . . . , Z with Z = ℓ2
pump from
Lemma 1, run the DP on wz
1Swz
2 with the two nodes of S forced to f.
(All seams internal to wz
1 and wz
2 are covered by this DP; no separate
”seam test” is needed.)
Theorem 1 (Soundness and completeness). If the verifier accepts some
guessed f, then f satisfies (F1) and (F2); conversely, if a feasible f exists,
some guess passes (V1)–(V2).
Proof sketch. (V1) is exactly (F1). For (F2), Lemma 1 shows it suffices to
check z ≤Z; (V2) performs those checks with a DP that validates all local
constraints, including seams created by repetition. Conversely, a feasible f
passes (V1) and by Lemma 1 also passes (V2) for all z ≤Z, hence for all
z.
Complexity and main theorem
Precomputation explores T and runs DPs on O(ℓpump)-length words, all in
2poly(β) time. Verification runs a polynomial number of DPs on strings of
length O(ℓ3
pump) (worst case, from z ≤ℓ2
pump and context width O(ℓpump)),
each in O(kβ2); altogether 2poly(β) = 2poly(N) time.

Non-circularity.
Context types are defined as a subset of global types

General r > 1 (remark).
All arguments lift to any fixed radius r: the
type space size becomes 2poly(βO(r)) (cf. Lemma 13), the DP has βO(r) states
per layer, and Lemma 1 still yields a finite Z from the same periodicity
argument.10

Optional algebraic view (boolean matrices with
the seam)
Let A ∈{0, 1}β×β be the adjacency of Cout–out: A[x, y] = 1 ⇐⇒(x, y) ∈
Cout–out. For a word w, define Cw ∈{0, 1}β×β by (Cw)ij = 1 iff there is a legal
labeling of w whose first/last outputs are i/j and nodewise (in(·), out(·)) ∈
Cin–out. Then boolean multiplication gives the exact composition law
Cxy = Cx A Cy,
hence
Cwz = Cw (ACw)z−1.
Proof: (i, k) ∈Cxy iff there exists j such that (i, j) ∈Cx, (j, k) ∈Cy, and
the seam output pair is legal, i.e. (j, ·) to (·, k) goes through an edge in
A—which is exactly the middle factor. This algebraic view is not needed for
the algorithm (the DP already checks seams), but it explains the role of the
seam explicitly.

NEXPTIME-hardness (explicit β-normalized radius-
1 model)
We prove that Feasible-Function Existence (mid-consistency (F1) only)
for β-normalized, radius-1 LCLs on globally oriented paths is NEXPTIME-
hard. Together with Theorem 2, this yields NEXPTIME-completeness. The
reduction is from Succinct-3SAT: a circuit C of size s defines, for each index
j ∈{0, 1}B, a 3-clause clause(j) over variables x1, . . . , x2B; the question is
whether the 2B-variable CNF ΦC is satisfiable.
What we use from the toolbox.
We rely on (i) the types/replacement/pumping
machinery (Lemmas 10–12, 14–15 in §4 of the reference), and (ii) the error-
chain technique to make malformed encodings harmless (as in §3 of the
reference).11
B.1
Target: FFE(F1) for β-normalized r=1
Recall our feasible-function existence problem FFE(F1): given Σin = {0, 1},
|Σout| = β, Cin–out ⊆Σin×Σout, Cout–out ⊆Σout×Σout, decide if there is a
map f : C →Σ2
out (on context types) satisfying mid-consistency (F1), cf. the
definition in the upper bound section.
B.2
Source and parameters
Let C be a succinct 3CNF generator of size s. Set
B = sc0,
β = sc1,
for large enough absolute constants c0 ≪c1 fixed below. We will build, in
poly(s) time, a β-normalized LCL PC = (Σin, Σout, Cin–out, Cout–out) such
that
ΦC is satisfiable
⇐⇒FFE(F1) holds for PC.
(1)
Since |Σout| = β = poly(s), the type space size ℓpump := |{Type(·)}| satisfies
ℓpump ≤2Θ(β4) = 2poly(s), and hence the contexts in C (those realized by
w1Sw2 with |wi| ∈{ℓpump, ℓpump+1}) cover exponentially many patterns,
which we will exploit.12

B.3
The block language and the verifiers
We describe Σout and the two verifiers in the β-normalized form.
The
construction follows the standard ”copy input and check a tableau by nearest-
neighbor rules” recipe, together with the error-chain gadget that guarantees
malformed inputs never constrain f.13
Alphabet Σout.
Each output symbol encodes a constant number of tracks:
(T1) a bit in which must copy the node’s input bit (enforced by Cin–out);
(T2) a role from a constant set {HEAD, RID, GID, RUN, PAD} and a constant-
size phase (synchronization);
(T3) three colors {RED, GRN, BLU} (used only at the 2-node window S);
(T4) a special plumbing symbol ⊥;
(T5) a bounded collection of error symbols (the error-chain alphabet) as in
§3;
(T6) (for RUN) the working alphabet for a fixed universal TM U running in
BO(1) time.
Thus |Σout| = β = poly(s).
The intended block.
A well-formed block (a regular language over Σout)
has the form
HEADC RID GID RUN PAD,
where:
• HEADC is a self-delimiting binary header that literally stores C on the
in track (copied to output by (T1)) and marks the start of a block.
• RID is a B-bit variable index region; GID is a B-bit clause index region.
• RUN is a row-by-row encoding of a tableau of the fixed machine U which,
given (C, RID, GID), runs for BO(1) steps and computes the three literals
13The radius-1 checking of a 1D flattening of a time poly(B) computation and the
error-chain idea are lifted verbatim from §3 (LBA encoding + locally checkable refutations).

of clause(GID) and their signs, and writes three length-B one-hot vectors
V (+), V (−) and V (⊥) on dedicated subtracks:
V (+)[i] = 1 ⇐⇒xi occurs positively in clause(GID),
V (−)[i] = 1 ⇐⇒¬xi occurs,
and V (⊥) is always all zero (reserved for BLU).
• In variable blocks we also run U on (C, RID) to materialize a variable
one-hot vector HotRID ∈{0, 1}B with HotRID[i] = 1 iff i = RID.
The adjacency table Cout–out permits exactly nearest-neighbor pairs con-
sistent with (i) the grammar above (placement of regions, row separators,
phases), and (ii) single-step correctness of U’s transition across each row
seam; malformed pieces are locally refutable by emitting an error-chain (as
in §3), which we also allow in Cout–out and which always leads to a successful
completion.14
The window S and activation.
The two nodes of the window S (in
contexts w1Sw2) may be labeled at f’s discretion by one of the colors
{RED, GRN, BLU} or by ⊥. No other output is allowed at S. The out–out
grammar is arranged so that:
The choice ⊥at S is always extendible. A non-⊥color at S
is extendible only if somewhere inside w1 (resp. w2) there is a
well-formed block whose HEADC matches the fixed header for C,
and whose RID (resp. GID) and tableau are valid.
We say such contexts are active; all other contexts are inactive. Inactive
contexts are thus tautologically satisfied by setting f(·) = ⊥.
Bridge semantics (the ”clause satisfied by variable” test).
For an
active ordered pair (variable on the left, clause on the right), the bridge (F1)
instance waS1wbwcS2wd is allowed to complete iff
∃i ∈[B] with HotRID[i] = 1 and





V (+)[i] = 1
if f(Type(left)) = RED,
V (−)[i] = 1
if f(Type(left)) = GRN,
V (⊥)[i] = 1
if f(Type(left)) = BLU.
14Exactly as in §3: a fixed finite set of error types and local rules allow every malformed
tableau to be disproved by a short, locally checkable chain; on well-formed encodings such
chains cannot be produced. :contentReference[oaicite:3]index=3
9

--- Page 10 ---
This ”∃i” is checked by a standard radius-1 witness chain: upon a color
choice at S1 and S2, the out–out grammar enables a path that (i) guesses
an index i, (ii) walks to bit i inside the left block and requires HotRID[i] = 1,
and (iii) walks to bit i inside the right block and requires the corresponding
V (·)[i] = 1. If any subcheck fails, the chain gets stuck (no completion). This
is exactly the same local ”existential witness” mechanism as in the error-
chain gadget, so it is implementable with radius 1 and a constant alphabet
overhead.15
All other ordered pairs of context types are trivialized: either at least one
side is inactive (then ⊥suffices), or the role pairing is not (variable, clause),
in which case the grammar ignores the colors and accepts with ⊥buffers.
B.4
Existence of exponentially many active context types
Because ℓpump = 2poly(s) and our header+index+run occupy O(s) + O(B) +
BO(1) = poly(s) symbols, by the pumping lemmas there are context types
that (i) have a valid block with any desired RID ∈{0, 1}B on the left and
(ii) context types that have a valid block with any desired GID on the right.
Moreover, types that differ in RID (or in GID) are distinct because, by design,
extendibility from S under a color differs for some bridge depending on the
bit pattern (the witness chain succeeds or not). Hence there are 2B = 2poly(s)
distinct variable types {Vari} and 2B distinct clause types {Clj} present
in C.16
B.5
Correctness of the reduction
We prove (1).
Lemma 2 (Completeness). If ΦC is satisfiable, then there exists f : C →Σ2
out
satisfying (F1) for PC.
Proof. Fix a satisfying assignment α : {x1, . . . , x2B} →{0, 1}. Define f as
follows.
• For each variable type Vari, set f(Vari) = RED if α(xi) = 1 and
f(Vari) = GRN if α(xi) = 0 (either orientation of S may be chosen; the
grammar handles both).
15Witness chains (existential pointers to positions with local checking) are the same
combinatorics as the §3 error pointers; we reuse their radius-1 implementation. :contentRe-
ference[oaicite:4]index=4
16Realization and stability of these patterns inside wb or wc follow from type compo-
sition and replacement; lengths are padded using pumping (§4, Lemmas 11–12, 14–15).
:contentReference[oaicite:5]index=5

--- Page 11 ---
• For each clause type Clj, pick any true literal of clause(j) under α and
set f(Clj) to its color: RED for a positive literal, GRN for a negative
literal (use BLU only if desired as a dummy literal, with V (⊥) ≡0 never
satisfying witnesses).
• For all inactive types, set f(τ) = ⊥.
Consider any ordered pair of contexts in the (F1) quantification. If at least
one side is inactive or the roles are not (variable, clause), the bridge is
trivial by construction. If the pair is (Vari, Clj), then by the definition of
the RUN subtracks we have HotRID[i] = 1 inside Vari, and V (+)[i] = 1 (resp.
V (−)[i] = 1) if we chose RED (resp. GRN) at Clj and the picked literal is xi
(resp. ¬xi). Since f(Clj) is a true literal of clause(j), such a choice exists,
and the bridge DP succeeds via a witness chain at index i. Hence every (F1)
check passes.
Lemma 3 (Soundness). If there exists f satisfying (F1) for PC, then ΦC is
satisfiable.
Proof. From f, read an assignment α by
α(xi) =





1,
f(Vari) = RED,
0,
f(Vari) = GRN,
arbitrary,
f(Vari) = BLU (we may fix it to 0),
for all variable types Vari (if f(Vari) = ⊥, the type is inactive, impossible
by construction of Vari). Fix any clause index j. If f(Clj) = ⊥then Clj is
inactive, which contradicts the existence of the header+RUN in Clj; hence
f(Clj) ∈{RED, GRN, BLU}.
Consider the (F1) bridge for the ordered
pair (Vari, Clj) where i ranges over all variables that appear in clause(j).
The out–out grammar allows completion only if there exists an index i
with HotRID[i] = 1 in Vari and the corresponding V (+)[i] = 1 (for RED)
or V (−)[i] = 1 (for GRN) in Clj. Because (F1) must hold for every such
ordered pair, the choice f(Clj) must be compatible with at least one Vari
that actually occurs in clause(j); therefore the picked color is a true literal
under α. Since j was arbitrary, every clause has a true literal: α satisfies
ΦC.
Lemma 4 (Inactive contexts never constrain f). If a context lacks a well-
formed header+indices+valid RUN (on either side), then any output at S
except ⊥makes the (F1) bridge DP fail, while ⊥always extends. Thus such
contexts are irrelevant and do not affect the existence of f.
11

--- Page 12 ---
Proof. Both statements follow from the grammar: non-⊥at S activates
witness chains that must eventually check bits inside a block; in the absence
of a valid block the chain gets stuck and no completion exists. Conversely,
when S is ⊥, the out–out table contains a self-looping ⊥buffer language that
trivially completes the bridge (the same plumbing as in the upper-bound
DP). The error-chain rules guarantee that malformed fragments admit locally
checkable refutations and hence do not impose constraints.17
Theorem 3 (FFE(F1) is NEXPTIME-complete). For β-normalized, radius-
1 LCLs on globally oriented paths (explicit model), Feasible-Function
Existence is NEXPTIME-complete.
Proof. Membership is Theorem 2. For hardness, the reduction C 7→PC runs
in poly(s) time and produces |Σout| = β = poly(s) with adjacency tables of
size Θ(β2). By Lemmas 2–4, (1) holds. Hence FFE(F1) is NEXPTIME-
hard.
B.6
From (F1) to the full feasible-function (F1)+(F2)
To pass from mid-consistency to the full feasible-function existence (bridging
included), add a neutral symbol ⊥(already present) and allow, in Cout–out,
arbitrary ⊥-labelings on repetitions wz
1 and wz
2. Then (F2) is vacuous: for
every context (w1, S, w2) and every z ≥1, the partial labeling that fixes S
to f(Type(w1Sw2)) extends by filling wz
i with ⊥. Hence:
Corollary 1 (Classification hardness). Deciding the distributed class (O(1)
vs. O(log∗n) vs. Θ(n)) via feasible functions is NEXPTIME-hard in the
explicit β-normalized, radius-1 model.
B.7
Size and radius bookkeeping
All rules are radius 1. The only growth parameter is β = poly(s), which
controls the number of output symbols needed for (i) the fixed role/phase
tracks, (ii) the three color tokens {RED, GRN, BLU} and ⊥, (iii) the fi-
nite error alphabet, and (iv) the universal machine U work alphabet. The
header+indices+RUN occupy O(s) + O(B) + BO(1) = poly(s) positions,
17See §3 for the error-chain ”disprover” gadget accepted by the verifier, ensuring mal-
formed encodings always have completions, and §4 for the ”plumbing” view of the DP.

whereas the pump length satisfies ℓpump = 2Θ(β4) = 2poly(s), which guaran-

replacement/pumping.18

error alphabet and local checking of bounded-time executions are from §3. :contentRefer-

=== round-0002/verifier.feedback.md ===
Overall, the three reports converge on a coherent “implicit SAT of types” program with a corrected ON/OFF bridge and a poly(s)-length, radius-1 clause tableau. That said, two correctness gaps and one design pitfall must be fixed to avoid trivial or unsound instances. The most serious is the possibility of allowing ⊥ at S on active contexts; as currently written, if ⊥ is permitted at S for active types and PAD/⊥ plumbing always succeeds, then (F1) becomes trivially satisfiable by setting f(·) ≡ ⊥. This would collapse the reduction. The fix is to forbid ⊥ at S on active contexts (and force offers/certificates) while allowing ⊥ only on inactive ones.

A second gap is sign binding. Prover 01 fixes this cleanly (clause picks occurrence only; the sign is read from the clause RUN). Provers 02/03 expose 6 sign-coded tokens at S; unless the grammar forces those tokens to match the verified sign for the selected occurrence p, the clause could cheat by picking an arbitrary sign. Adopt 01’s O1/O2/O3 palette or add a local check tying S’s sign to the RUN.

Finally, the equality/inequality-gate needs a formal “exclusivity lemma”: exactly one of the two certificates is realizable for a given pair, with radius-1 witness chains that cannot be faked. Provide the minimal local invariants (one-hot RID, pointer integrity, bit-by-bit compare) and a short counterexample analysis showing attempted fakes dead-end.

3-row table of key claims
| Claim (short) | Status | Why |
| Gate gives exactly one ON pair | Unclear | Needs a formal exclusivity lemma for equality/inequality witnesses; also depends on banning ⊥ at active S so OFF cannot bypass ON. |
| Sign bound to clause RUN | Unclear | 01: OK (S picks occurrence only). 02/03: unclear unless S-token sign is locally forced to equal RUN’s sign for the selected occurrence. |
| Trivializing (F2) without trivializing (F1) | Broken | If ⊥ is allowed at S on active contexts and PAD/⊥ always fills, f(·) ≡ ⊥ satisfies (F1). Must forbid ⊥ at S on active contexts. |

Value triage: The SAT-of-types framing, window anchoring, and the poly(s)-length tableau are solid and valuable. Patch H (01) resolves the quantifier mismatch cleanly. 02’s equality/inequality gate is a good mechanism provided exclusivity is proven and sign binding is enforced. 03’s general succinct-SAT capture is useful context and upper-bound bookkeeping.

Next steps: (i) Prove the exclusivity lemma with explicit seam rules and witness invariants; (ii) forbid ⊥ at S on active contexts in Cout–out and re-verify nontriviality; (iii) adopt 01’s O1/O2/O3 palette or add a local sign-check tying S to RUN; (iv) complete the B=2 DP table to sanity-check ON/OFF and sign logic.

Verifier notes (2025-08-27):
- Adopt a hybrid: use Prover 02’s gate to separate ON (i∈vars(j)) from OFF pairs, and Prover 01’s window-anchored blocks to keep all semantics within wb/wc.
- Replace any O(1)-time checker with a poly(s)-length, radius-1 tableau inside wc (and wb as needed) that verifies C(j) and exposes the needed bits to the gate; ensure error-chain refutations for malformed headers.
- Do not rely on boundary-only signatures for type multiplicity; instead, separate types by differential boundary-extendibility induced by interior content (witness success/failure under fixed S-labels).
- Action items: (i) write explicit boundary tables (offers, gate, PAD/CAP conduits), (ii) specify the clause-verification tableau and its alphabet, (iii) prove type-separation and OFF/ON correctness, (iv) complete a B=2 worked example with DP simulation.
Verifier notes addendum (2025-08-27):
- Critical: Forbid ⊥ at S on active contexts. Adjust Cout–out so that when the window anchors a well-formed variable/clause block, the S palette excludes ⊥ and forces an offer; only inactive contexts allow ⊥. This preserves nontriviality of (F1).
- Adopt Prover 01’s occurrence-only S palette {O1,O2,O3}; read the sign from the verified RUN. If using sign-coded S tokens, add a local rule that forces the S-sign to equal the RUN’s sign for the selected occurrence.
- Gate exclusivity: Write and prove a radius-1 lemma that exactly one of equality/inequality certificates is realizable, with CAP allowed only under equality and PAD only under inequality.
- Type separation: Prefer a neutral tester j* (present as a type but labelable so it imposes no constraints under f) to guarantee distinct Var_i without relying on properties of C. Validate no side effects on (F1) or (F2).
- Proceed with explicit seam tables (offers, gate, CAP/PAD), the clause RUN tiles and error chains, and the B=2 worked DP table.
