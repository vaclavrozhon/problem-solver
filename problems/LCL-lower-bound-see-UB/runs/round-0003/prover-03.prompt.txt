\paragraph{One-line summary.}
Prove NEXPTIME-hardness for the following problem. Given a $\beta$-normalized, radius-1 LCL on globally oriented paths, the problem is to decide whether the local complexity of that problem is $O(1)$ vs.\ $\Omega(\log^* n)$ vs.\ $\Omega(n)$.


\section*{Problem setup}


We work in the standard \textsc{Local} model on globally oriented paths. An LCL is \emph{$\beta$-normalized (radius 1)} if it has:
\begin{itemize}
  \item binary input alphabet $\SigIn=\{0,1\}$,
  \item output alphabet $\SigOut$ of size $\beta$,
  \item legality checked only by two tables: $\Cinout\subseteq\SigIn\times\SigOut$ and $\Coutout\subseteq\SigOut\times\SigOut$.
\end{itemize}
A labeling is legal iff $(\mathrm{in}(v),\mathrm{out}(v))\in \Cinout$ at each node $v$ and $(\mathrm{out}(u),\mathrm{out}(v))\in \Coutout$ on each directed edge $u\!\to\! v$.


\paragraph{Encoding size.}
We assume an explicit encoding of $(\Cinout,\Coutout)$ of size $\mathrm{poly}(\beta)$ (e.g., $\Cinout$ as a $2\times \beta$ Boolean table and $\Coutout$ as a $\beta\times \beta$ Boolean table). We measure time in the input length $N=\mathrm{poly}(\beta)$.


\paragraph{Your task}
Your task is to prove that this task is hard as possible. Aim for NEXPTIME-hardness. 


\paragraph{First attached paper}
The attached paper proves that the problem is PSPACE-hard. Their reduction shows that one can encode the execution of an automaton as a local problem. You have to understand that paper thoroughly, since your goal is to improve upon their result. However, that proof does not easily generalize – it is important that the tape of the simulated automaton has polynomial length, which naively cannot lead to a better than PSPACE hardness. 


\paragraph{Second attached draft}
The attached draft shows the sketch of a proof of a better NEXPTIME algorithm than the one in the original paper. This may give you some intuition about the computational bottleneck that can be used to prove hardness.

...
 types Clj at their first two boundary nodes.
  - This makes RID/GID selection a property of the context’s type (since the type is precisely the yes/no table of extendibility for all 4-boundary assignments). Because the type equivalence class records, for each of β^4 boundary assignments, whether a completion exists, we have more than enough capacity to separate 2^B different behaviors when β = poly(s) and B = s^{c0} with a larger constant in β.
- Witness chains initiated at S. Upon placing a non-⊥ color at S (RED/GRN/BLU), the out–out rules enable a local “witness chain” that walks from S to (i) the right boundary of the left context and (ii) the left boundary of the right context. At those boundaries, it must latch onto the proper keys (kv,i, rv,i) and (kc,j, lc,j). From the keys, the chain enters the corresponding interior block modules that encode, via a row-by-row 1D tableau, the vectors HotRID (one-hot) and the three clause-indicator vectors V(+),V(−),V(⊥) computed by a fixed universal TM U on input (C, RID, GID). The chain succeeds iff for the chosen color, there exists a bit position p such that HotRID[p]=1 and V(±/⊥)[p]=1 as appropriate. If any subcheck fails, the chain cannot be completed (no completion exists, hence the DP rejects). All of this is radius-1: pointer segments are finite-state “pipes” checked by Cout–out, and each tape row transition in RUN is enforced by nearest-neighbor constraints, exactly as in §3 of the reference.
- Uniformity within types. Because keys reside at the 4 boundary nodes and the admissible continuations for a given key are baked into the out–out table, the existence/non-existence of a successful witness is purely a type property. That is, any two representatives of the same type have identical extendibility tables for all 4-boundary assignments; hence for a fixed color at S, either both admit some completion (with the appropriate key) or neither do.

Why exponentially many (context) types are available
- Type count. For r=1, types are determined by: (i) 2^4 choices of boundary inputs and (ii) a β^4-bit truth table indicating which 4-boundary output assignments are extendible. Hence |Types| ≤ 2^4 · 2^{β^4} = 2^{Θ(β^4)}. With β = s^{c1}, pick c1≫c0 so that 2^{β^4} ≫ 2^B. Thus we can assign pairwise distinct truth tables to the 2^B desired variable keys and to the 2^B clause keys, leaving plenty of slack for all other contexts.
- Realization by radius-1 rules. Each distinct truth table is realized by tailoring the local “plumbing” around the 4 boundary nodes: for each of the β^4 boundary assignments, either permit at least one outgoing legal extension (by supplying a small admissible gadget that grows into the variable/clause block and RUN) or forbid any extension (by forcing dead ends unless an error-chain is emitted, which we disallow when S carries a non-⊥ color). This is purely in Cout–out and Cin–out and does not depend on interior inputs.

Soundness and completeness of the reduction (cleaned)
- Source: Succinct-3SAT instance C of size s. We set β = s^{c1} and work in the explicit β-normalized, radius-1 model.
- Target: PC = (Σin={0,1}, Σout of size β, Cin–out, Cout–out). The alphabet has fixed tracks: role/phase, ⊥, 3 colors {RED,GRN,BLU}, finitely many error symbols, and the work alphabet for U (all independent of B), as in §3.
- Variable and clause types. We reserve 2^B variable types {Vari} and 2^B clause types {Clj} by their boundary keys, as above. All other types are “inactive” and accept ⊥ at S unconditionally.
- (⇒) If ΦC is satisfiable, define f on types by: f(Vari)=RED if α(xi)=1 else GRN; f(Clj) is set to a color that corresponds to some true literal in clause(j) (RED for positive, GRN for negative; BLU is unused/dummy); f(τ)=⊥ for all inactive types. For any ordered pair of contexts, if both are active and in roles (variable,clause), the witness chain succeeds by picking the unique hot position for RID (enforced by the variable block) and the matching 1 in V(±) (enforced by the clause block). All other ordered pairs are trivialized (either inactive or the grammar ignores colors in those role combinations), hence all (F1) DP checks pass.
- (⇐) If there exists f satisfying (F1), read an assignment α from the variable types: α(xi)=1 iff f(Vari)=RED, α(xi)=0 iff f(Vari)=GRN (BLU impossible for variable types by construction; if allowed, fix it arbitrarily). Fix any clause j. Since (F1) must hold for the ordered pair (Vari, Clj) for the i appearing in clause(j), the only way the DP can succeed (given the grammar) is that f(Clj) picks a color that matches a true literal under α (the witness chain cannot otherwise be completed). Hence every clause has a true literal and α satisfies ΦC.
- Inactive contexts never constrain f: for any type without the proper boundary keys and RUN plumbing, any non-⊥ color at S leads to a dead-end (no completion), whereas ⊥ always admits a completion via the neutral plumbing and/or the standard error-chain (per §3). Thus assigning f(τ)=⊥ for all such τ ensures all mixed-type (F1) checks pass.

From FFE(F1) to the tri-class classification
- As in the draft: (F1) characterizes O(log* n) vs. Θ(n) (Theorem 8 machinery), and adding a neutral ⊥ that freely fills repetitions makes (F2) vacuous, whence (F1)+(F2) yields O(1) (Theorem 9 machinery). Therefore:
  - Distinguishing Θ(n) vs. sublinear (i.e., the existence of a feasible f) is NEXPTIME-hard.
  - Distinguishing O(1) vs. Ω(log* n) (by toggling (F2) via ⊥-filling) is also NEXPTIME-hard.
  - Hence the full three-way classification is NEXPTIME-hard under the explicit β-normalized encoding.

Checkability and complexity bookkeeping
- Radius 1: All constraints (role placement, boundary keys, pointer pipes, RUN row-to-row evolution, and error-chains) involve each node and its predecessor only, i.e., exactly Cin–out and Cout–out.
- Alphabet size: Σout is of size β = poly(s); the number of “states” required for roles, phases, pipes, and U is constant. The heavy lifting (2^B distinct behaviors) is encoded not in new symbols but in the accept/reject decisions for the β^4 boundary assignments (the type truth tables), which are programmed into Cout–out.
- Lengths: Contexts have length ≈ℓpump (double-exponential in s), so there is ample room to host the O(poly(s))-size headers/indices and RUNs needed to compute clause(j) from C.

Examples / sanity checks
- Toy instance: Fix B=2, so there are 4 variable and 4 clause types. Assign four disjoint pairs of boundary keys for the variables on the right and four for the clauses on the left. The seam witness for RED requires a position p with HotRID[p]=1 and V(+)[p]=1; the grammar enforces that exactly one p has HotRID[p]=1, and RUN computes V(+) correctly from C and GID. Testing all 16 ordered pairs (Vari, Clj) by hand recovers the truth table of satisfaction.

Next steps (concrete, verifiable)
1) Formalize the boundary-keyed type lemma: Given β, construct Cout–out so that for any prescribed subset S⊆[β]^4 (boundary assignments) of size ≤2^B we can realize a type whose extendibility table equals the indicator of S. This pins down the “truth table capacity” rigorously.
2) Write the exact local transition rules for the pointer pipes and RUN rows, following §3 of the reference, and count the number of symbols added (to check β=poly(s) suffices).
3) Prove the uniformity lemma: For any two words of the same type, the success/failure of the (F1) DP for a fixed pair of types and a fixed color at S is identical. This uses Lemma 11 (replacement) to justify that only the boundary truth tables matter.
4) Integrate the ⊥-filling trick to make (F2) vacuous and connect the hardness to the O(1) vs. Ω(log* n) gap explicitly.

Why useful here
- The boundary-keyed construction eliminates the “activity” non-invariance and anchors the reduction in the type semantics used by the NEXPTIME verifier. Establishing this rigorously will convert the hardness sketch into a clean, auditable proof.

## Round 0002 — 2025-08-28T11:46:01.458097Z

Status. We have a solid upper-bound skeleton (types, composition, periodicity, finite-Z for (F2), and the O(kβ^2) DP) captured in output.md. To push hardness to NEXPTIME for the 3-way classifier, I focus on formalizing the succinct 3-coloring reduction via (F1), with two key technical lemmas: (i) type-separation per vertex index u using a boundary-probe truth-table signature realized by a radius-1 checker; (ii) a seam gadget that, on colored S-windows, locally simulates D(u,v) (adjacency) across the bridge, accepting iff either non-edge or colors differ. I also point out a minor optional tightening in output.md and confirm its current statements are correct as written.

Gaps/remarks on output.md (minor). 
- The ℓ^2 bound in Corollary 4 is correct and sufficient; optionally, one can refine Z to preperiod1 + preperiod2 + lcm(period1, period2) ≤ 2ℓ + ℓ ≤ 3ℓ (or ≤ lcm periods) by analyzing the pair map on T×T, but this is nonessential. The current deterministic DP lemma (Theorem 5) is correct; an explicit treatment of boundary inputs when k<4 is trivial and can be omitted. No correctness issues spotted.

Plan and why useful. 
- Pivot source to Succinct 3-Coloring (NEXP-complete). For a circuit D of size s deciding adjacency on V={0,1}^B (B=s^{c0}), we construct a β-normalized, r=1 LCL P_D with β=s^{c1} (c1≫c0) so that: existence of a feasible function (F1) ⇔ G is 3-colorable. This matches (F1)’s universal quantification (pairwise inequality on edges) and avoids clause-level ∃-quantifiers.

Core technical ingredients (new lemmas, concrete gadgets).

Lemma A (Type-separation via boundary-probe signature). Fix integers B=s^{c0} and β=s^{c1} with 4c1>c0. There exists a radius-1 β-normalized LCL fragment that enforces: for any path segment W that contains a well-formed vertex block encoding an index u∈{0,1}^B (and no errors), the type Type(W) has extendibility truth-table over the β^4 boundary-output assignments equal to an injective signature g(u)∈{0,1}^{β^4}. In particular, u≠u′ ⇒ Type(W)≠Type(W′).
- Construction sketch (radius-1):
  • Reserve in Σ_out constant tracks: role/phase, error alphabet, a ⊥-plumbing symbol, and a RUN track for a fixed universal TM U. The vertex block stores u in a self-delimiting header and includes a short RUN zone computing on demand bits of an injective signature g(u) of length L=β^4≥2^B (we can set g(u) to the length-L zero-padded copy of u followed by a fixed injective encoding). The run budget is poly(s).
  • Boundary-probe coding: Each of the four boundary outputs carries an index digit in base β; together they encode b∈[β^4] (the probe index). Adjacency rules copy these 4 base-β digits along “carrier” subtracks deterministically from both ends toward the interior (radius-1 constraints enforcing equality along edges). If the two ends encode different b, a detector in the middle halts with an unsatisfiable local pattern ⇒ that boundary assignment is rejected (truth-table bit 0). If they match, the bridge enables U to read (u,b) from the interior/carriers and compute g(u)[b] in poly(s) steps within W. Local acceptance (extendibility) is permitted iff g(u)[b]=1 (otherwise the RUN must end in a dead configuration). Malformed interiors open an error-chain (always extendible) and are hence excluded when defining vertex types.
- Why useful: It produces ≥2^B distinct types attributable to different u while using only β symbols and radius 1; f can then assign colors per vertex-type τ_u.

Lemma B (Realization of vertex context types near S). For each u, there exist contexts (w_1,S,w_2) with |w_i|∈{ℓ_pump,ℓ_pump+1} whose left (or right) side contains a well-formed vertex block for u adjacent (within O(1)) to S, and whose type equals the Type(W) from Lemma A. Moreover, replacement/pumping (Lemmas 11, 14–15) ensure that these contexts persist under padding to the required lengths.
- Why useful: Guarantees the context set C contains, for each u, at least one “vertex” type τ_u on which f can act.

Lemma C (Seam gadget for succinct adjacency and color inequality). There is a radius-1 out–out grammar across the seam between a left τ_u-context and a right τ_v-context such that, when both S windows are colored, the bridge wa S_1 wb wc S_2 wd admits a completion iff either D(u,v)=0 (non-edge) or D(u,v)=1 and the two colors differ. If either side is not a vertex context (no valid block), the seam always completes (via ⊥-plumbing or error chains) irrespective of S.
- Construction sketch:
  • Seam handshake: Near each S window, a constant-size “handshake” subtrack asserts role=VERTEX, and opens a bounded-width corridor through wb∘wc where a fixed TM U simulates D(u,v) for poly(s) steps using the copies of D from the interiors and seam pointers that fetch u (on the left) and v (on the right). As in §3 of the attached paper, each tableau row is locally checked by Cout–out; malformed runs are locally refutable (error-chain), keeping non-vertex contexts harmless.
  • Acceptance policy: The corridor exposes a verdict bit Edge(u,v). The adjacency table then enforces: if Edge=0, accept regardless of colors; if Edge=1, require Color(S_1)≠Color(S_2) (three colors in a constant subalphabet). Violations force a dead pattern (no completion). All checks are radius-1 because comparisons are between adjacent row/phase symbols and the two S outputs.
- Why useful: Encodes the exact pairwise 3-coloring constraint on edges within (F1)’s universal pair quantification; non-edges/vacuous pairs always pass.

Lemma D (Bridging neutralization). Add ⊥-repetition plumbing: for any context (w_1,S,w_2), all repetitions w_1^z and w_2^z can be filled entirely with ⊥ while remaining compatible with any S outputs and the fixed boundary inputs. Then (F2) holds for every f.
- Why useful: Collapses the three-class decision to (F1)-feasibility, transferring NEXP-hardness to the classifier (O(1) vs Ω(n) on our instances).

Soundness/completeness outline for the reduction (auditable).
- Parameters: Choose c1≫c0 so that β^4 = s^{4c1} ≥ 2B; then ℓ_pump = 2^{Θ(β^4)} = 2^{poly(s)}. Block length is poly(s)≪ℓ_pump.
- Cmpltns:
  • If G is 3-colorable with χ:V→{R,G,B}, define f(τ_u) = (χ(u) on S) and f(τ)=⊥ for non-vertex types. For any ordered pair (τ_left, τ_right), the seam gadget computes Edge(u,v); non-edges accept; edges accept iff χ(u)≠χ(v). Hence all (F1) checks pass. (F2) is vacuous by Lemma D.
- Sndnss:
  • If f satisfies (F1), read χ(u)=f(τ_u). Consider any edge (u,v). The pair (τ_u, τ_v) must pass the (F1) DP; by Lemma C, this forces χ(u)≠χ(v). Therefore χ is a proper 3-coloring.

Key implementation details (to be checked next, but radius-1 and β=poly(s)).
- Fixed tracks in Σ_out (constant multiplicity): role/phase states; three color tokens and ⊥; RUN work alphabet of the fixed U; error-chain symbols. The total |Σ_out|=β can be chosen polynomial in s to host these tracks.
- Probe carriers: The four boundary positions provide base-β digits (b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4) coding b∈[β^4]; per-edge Cout–out permits copying these digits unchanged along special carrier tracks. A small synchronizer ensures two carriers meet and agree before the RUN consults b.
- Robustness: Any malformed header/index/RUN admits a locally checkable error-chain (as in the LBA construction), so such contexts never constrain f; they can be mapped to ⊥ by f.

Toy sanity checks.
- Tiny β example: Let β=3, reserve 3 colors+⊥ and minimal RUN symbols. With B=2 (four vertices), choose a trivial D; the seam accepts iff colors differ on the unique edge case. The probe signature g(u) can be just the 9-bit (β^4=81 in general; here smaller) table determined by U’s response to the four boundary symbols; in the toy, let g(u) encode u across a few “distinguishing” boundary assignments to see Type(W_u)≠Type(W_v) by direct DP.

Obstacles and mitigations.
- Probe capacity vs. 2^B: We cannot dedicate a distinct boundary 4-tuple per u since β^4≪2^B; instead we use the full truth-table over β^4 probes, mapping u↦g(u)∈{0,1}^{β^4} injectively (possible since β^4≥B). The grammar is uniform; dependence on u enters only via the interior-encoded u read by U.
- Uniformity within types: Because the probe acceptance policy is fixed and depends only on (boundary 4-tuple, interior u), all representatives of the same type (i.e., same interior u and no errors) yield identical extendibility tables, satisfying type-invariance.
- Ensuring active τ_u exist: Use Lemma 11 (replacement) and Lemmas 14–15 (pumping) to embed the O(poly(s))-length block adjacent to S within words of length ℓ_pump or ℓ_pump+1 on each side, without changing the type.

Next concrete steps (incremental, testable).
1) Formalize Lemma A. Specify: (i) the base-β boundary-digit carriers and their radius-1 propagation; (ii) the U-simulation that, given (u,b), outputs g(u)[b] and how Cout–out enforces acceptance iff 1. Prove type-separation: u≠u′ ⇒ the truth tables differ in at least one b.
2) Formalize Lemma C. Write the exact row interface and verdict wiring so that (Edge=0) ⇒ unconditional acceptance, (Edge=1) ⇒ require Color(S_1)≠Color(S_2). Include the local refutation for malformed runs.
3) Prove Lemma B: a clean pumping/replacement embedding argument placing blocks within contexts of the required lengths while preserving type.
4) Package the construction P_D and the equivalence “G 3-colorable ⇔ (F1)-feasible f exists,” then add the ⊥-repetition rules (Lemma D) to transfer hardness to the O(1)/Ω(n) classification.

Why this is progress.
- It addresses the main unresolved pieces flagged by the verifier: a type-invariant “activity” mechanism and a pairwise constraint that matches (F1). The boundary-probe signature provides exponentially many distinct types with β=poly(s) and radius-1 rules; the seam gadget exactly encodes edge constraints suitable for (F1). These are compact, checkable subclaims that can be verified independently using the O(kβ^2) DP.

## Round 0002 — 2025-08-28T11:43:33Z

Focus and plan for this round
- Goal: push the NEXPTIME-hardness via Succinct 3-Coloring (S3Col) by cleanly aligning (F1) mid-consistency with pairwise edge constraints “color(u) ≠ color(v) when D(u,v)=1”. Make (F2) vacuous via ⊥-filler. Deliver concrete, radius-1 gadgets and type-separation lemmas that are checkable and do not rely on per-type ad hoc rules.
- This round: (i) state and justify a “boundary-anchored vertex-type separation” lemma; (ii) design a seam simulation gadget that, on active vertex–vertex pairs, computes D(u,v) in the bridge and enforces inequality if D(u,v)=1 while accepting any colors if D(u,v)=0; (iii) detail the ⊥-filler that neutralizes (F2); (iv) give a small B=2 sanity check; (v) log minor clarifications for output.md.

Context recap from last round
- Use S3Col: input is circuit D of size s deciding an undirected succinct graph on V={0,1}^B (we can symmetrize by using D′(u,v):=D(u,v)∨D(v,u)). Set B=s^{c0}, choose |Σ_out|=β=s^{c1} with c1≫c0. ℓ_pump=2^{Θ(β^4)}≫poly(s) so we have ample pumping room. We only need vertex-types (no clause-types).

Key new lemmas (informal statements, why useful, and how to validate)
1) Boundary-anchored vertex-type separation (existence of 2^B distinct vertex types)
- Statement. There exists a β-normalized, radius-1 schema (global Cin–out, Cout–out) with constant role/phase/error/work tracks such that for each index u∈{0,1}^B there is at least one context type τ_u in the context set C (realizable by some input word w_1 S w_2) with the following properties:
  (A) Vertex activation near S on the left side: if the two-node window S is colored (non-⊥) and the left side is intended to be a vertex, then a radius-1 forced “index header” of length Θ(B) is determined immediately to the left of S; this header copies the B input bits (RID-track) adjacent to S via Cin–out, so the u encoded in input is fixed. All malformed attempts can be locally refuted by error-chains.
  (B) Probe distinguishability: there exists a fixed 4-tuple b⋆ of boundary outputs on the four boundary nodes of w_1 (two leftmost and two “second” nodes) such that E_{w_1}(b⋆)=1 iff the input RID next to S equals u. Consequently, if u≠u′, then τ_u≠τ_{u′} (types differ on b⋆).
- Why useful: gives us exponentially many pairwise distinct vertex context types, allowing a map f on types to encode a coloring χ(u)∈{RED,GRN,BLU}.
- How enforced at radius 1. We predefine a reserved “probe-left” boundary pattern b⋆ using symbols that (i) fix a role/phase state at the two boundary layers and (ii) enable a single deterministic pipe that walks inward for B steps, checking at position j that the RID-output symbol agrees with the local input bit (Cin–out) and with a constant j-th bit of the target u. If any check fails, the pipe has no legal continuation (no extension). If all pass, the pipe halts into a neutral filler. Because the pipe is unique, the existential nature of types cannot “cheat” by choosing a different interior: existence of a completion under b⋆ exactly encodes “RID equals u”.
- Validation: The pipe is exactly the standard radius-1 pointer gadget (Section 3 in the attached paper) but with a bounded, fixed length B and equality tests via Cin–out. The existence of contexts carrying any prescribed B-bit RID adjacent to S is guaranteed by considering input words over Σ_in; malformed inputs are harmless due to error-chains.

2) Seam-simulation gadget for pairwise constraints (edge gating and color inequality)
- Statement. There is a radius-1 out–out schema such that for any ordered pair of active vertex types (τ_u on the left, τ_v on the right):
  (i) If D(u,v)=0, there is a completion irrespective of the colors f(τ_u), f(τ_v) placed on the window S; (ii) If D(u,v)=1, there is a completion iff the two colors differ; and (iii) For any pair where at least one side is inactive (no well-formed vertex near S), there is always a completion (via ⊥-plumbing), independent of the other side.
- Why useful: This aligns (F1)’s universal quantification with 3-coloring constraints: f feasible ⇔ χ(u)≠χ(v) for all edges (u,v).
- Seam layout (radius-1):
  • Near-boundary index tapes. On each side, the Θ(B)-long RID tape sits immediately adjacent to S (by Lemma 1). We also place a fixed-size “header acceptance” bit (valid if the embedded header equals the constant D-encoding)
  • Bridge tableau. On the wb◦wc bridge, allow a standard 1D row-by-row simulation of a fixed universal TM U for poly(s) steps to evaluate D(u,v), reading the two B-bit tapes and the constant header. Each row transition is enforced by nearest-neighbor Cout–out constraints; malformed rows can be refuted by error-chains as in §3.
  • Acceptance signals. The simulation emits a bit EDGE∈{0,1}. Local rules at S admit completion if (EDGE=0) or (EDGE=1 and colors on S are unequal). If EDGE=1 and colors equal, all continuations are forbidden. All these checks involve only constant-size neighborhoods around S.
- Validation: Standard “computation-by-tiling” for 1D simulations as in §3 and §4; run time is poly(s)≪ℓ_pump and space sits in wb◦wc (length ≥ℓ_pump). Robustness via error-chains ensures that malformed headers and/or runs never constrain f.

3) Neutralizing bridging (F2) by a ⊥-filler
- Statement. Add a self-looping ⊥-track and allow wz (for any z≥1) to be filled entirely with ⊥ irrespective of boundary outputs adjacent to S. Then for every context (w_1,S,w_2) and z, the partial S-label from f extends by filling both sides with ⊥, making (F2) hold vacuously.
- Why useful: Reduces the classification to (F1) only on our instances, hence the 3-way classifier must output O(1) iff a feasible f exists and Ω(n) otherwise; the Θ(log* n) case is eliminated for our reduction family.
- Validation: This is compatible with the DP in output.md (Theorem 5) and with Lemma 1 (finite-Z) but stronger: it makes every z trivially feasible. It does not interfere with (F1) since (F1) instances use one copy of each side and the bridge; those are left unchanged by the ⊥-filler language.

Blueprint of the alphabet/tracks and local rules (radius-1, β=poly(s))
- Fixed tracks in Σ_out (constant per node, combined into a single symbol):
  1) Role/phase: {HEAD, VERT, RUN, PAD, PIPE, ERR_k, …}×{phase modulo c}.
  2) Header bits: output track that must match a fixed string enc(D) under HEAD-role; Cin–out ties head-bit outputs to Σ_in bits so only inputs matching enc(D) allow HEAD.
  3) RID tape: B bits adjacent to S on each vertex side; Cin–out enforces that RID-bit output equals the input bit at that node (copy constraint) when in VERT-role.
  4) Bridge-run work alphabet: constant-size tape symbols for U.
  5) Color tokens and ⊥ at S: {RED, GRN, BLU, ⊥} available only at S positions (enforced by phases/roles around S).
  6) Error-chain alphabet from §3 to refute malformed fragments locally.
- Cin–out usage: ties HEAD bits to input; ties RID bits to input; allows generic symbols elsewhere. This guarantees that whether a vertex is well-formed is determined by inputs (hence activity is type-invariant once the boundary role is fixed).
- Cout–out (nearest-neighbor): enumerates allowed pairs that (i) implement the deterministic PIPE for Lemma 1 (RID-forcing/probe), (ii) implement the RUN tableau rows and acceptance edge-bit, (iii) enforce color inequality test when EDGE=1, and (iv) allow ⊥-plumbing everywhere if chosen.

Soundness/completeness sketches of the reduction (S3Col → FFE(F1))
- Completeness (G 3-colorable ⇒ feasible f exists): choose χ:V→{R,G,B}. For each vertex-type τ_u, set f(τ_u)=χ(u); for all other (inactive) types, set f(τ)=⊥. For any ordered pair, if both are active, the bridge computes EDGE=D(u,v). If EDGE=0, completion exists; if EDGE=1 then χ(u)≠χ(v) ensures completion by inequality check. All non-active pairs are vacuous due to ⊥-plumbing. Hence (F1) holds.
- Soundness (feasible f ⇒ G 3-colorable): for each u, define χ(u)=f(τ_u) (well-defined since otherwise the ordered pair of two τ_u representatives would violate (F1) via the bridge rules that require consistent acceptance conditions). For any edge (u,v), the bridge yields EDGE=1; thus (F1) forces f(τ_u)≠f(τ_v). Therefore χ is a proper 3-coloring.

Toy sanity check (B=2)
- Suppose V={00,01,10,11} and D encodes a 4-cycle 00–01–11–10–00. Contexts include τ_00,…,τ_11, each with RID=that index adjacent to S on the left or right side. The bridge-run reads those 2-bit RID tapes, computes EDGE (using D hardwired), and enforces inequality iff EDGE=1. A valid f assigns a 3-coloring of the 4-cycle; the DP on each (F1) instance accepts exactly under that condition.

Obstacles and how we address them
- Type invariance vs. interior nondeterminism: Lemma 1’s PIPE is deterministic and initiated solely by boundary outputs; if the probe is selected, the only way to extend is to carry the unique pipeline and match the B-bit RID from input. Thus the existence/non-existence of an extension under the probe is a property of the fixed input substring near the boundary, hence of the type.
- Non-edges must accept any colors: We ensure the bridge-run emits EDGE=0 in that case, and acceptance rules ignore S colors. Since (F1) only needs existence of one completion, this suffices.
- Symmetry of edges: Replace D by D′(u,v)=D(u,v)∨D(v,u) in the instance to guarantee undirected adjacency while keeping size poly(s).
- Global inputs adversarial: Our complexity claim is worst-case over inputs. The construction ensures malformed inputs are always completable (⊥/error-chain) and do not constrain f; active contexts (those that matter) arise from many input strings (enough to ensure all τ_u exist as realizable types), which suffices because (F1) quantifies over all contexts.

Gaps/clarifications in output.md (minor)
- Composition lemma wording (Lemma 2): the proof mentions “two internal adjacencies across the seam” using (p_left,p_right); to avoid confusion, note explicitly that (i) the adjacency within u between its last two outputs and within v between its first two outputs are already captured by Type(u), Type(v), and (ii) the seam adjacency is only between the last output of u (p_right) and the first of v (p_left); the boolean-matrix view in Appendix A already encodes this correctly.
- Types vs. interior inputs: Definition currently says “interior inputs may be arbitrary”; in our β-normalized model inputs are fixed per instance. It may help to state explicitly that E_w(a) is computed with the interior inputs fixed to those of w; this is consistent with Lemmas 10–15 in the attached paper and with the DP in Theorem 5.

Why the new lemmas are auditable now
- Lemma 1 reduces to a finite-radius PIPE with length B=poly(s) (bounded independent of ℓ_pump) that is checkable by local tables; E_w(b⋆) depends only on the fixed w (hence on Type(w)). The verifier can test a concrete instantiation on a small B (e.g., B=2) by brute-force DP to observe the extendibility difference.
- The seam simulation is a standard 1D tableau simulation; a checker can write out the row alphabet and the local transition constraints for a small instance (with a 2-input AND gate as D) and verify the edge/inequality behavior.

Next steps (concrete, checkable deliverables)
1) Write the explicit adjacency fragments:
   - RID-PIPE: list states for “step j” (0≤j≤B), legal successors, and Cin–out masks that tie role=RID,j to the input bit.
   - Bridge-run: define the U-row alphabet and per-row local constraints; define the EDGE output; layout how it reads RID tapes.
   - Color-check rules at S conditional on EDGE.
2) Prove the vertex-type separation lemma formally: select b⋆, show E_w(b⋆)=1⇔RID(u) and that u≠u′ gives differing extendibility tables ⇒ distinct types.
3) Formalize the soundness/completeness argument into a theorem “S3Col ≤_m FFE(F1) for β-normalized r=1” with explicit size bounds (|Σ_out|=poly(s), tables of size Θ(β^2)).
4) Integrate the ⊥-filler rules and note that (F2) is vacuous; state the corollary “3-way classification is NEXPTIME-hard on our family”.

Potential stretch: tighten the (F2) finite-Z bound in output.md from ℓ^2 to lcm(periods)×(max preperiod) (still ≤ℓ^2) and add a remark on how to compute it from the type DFA; not needed for hardness but improves the upper-bound section.

## Round 0002 — 2025-08-28T11:46:48.770121Z

Ideas: boundary-probe separation for vertex types; succinct 3-coloring bridge
- Pivot retained: Reduce Succinct 3-Coloring (NEXP-complete) to Feasible-Function Existence (F1) for β-normalized, r=1 LCLs on oriented paths. Colors at the S-window implement the vertex coloring; the bridge between two contexts simulates D(u,v) and enforces “≠” iff D(u,v)=1.
- New ingredient (type separation without per-type tailoring): Design a fixed family of boundary-output “probe patterns” Q_j (one per bit index j∈[B]) that, when set on the four boundary nodes of a context, uniformly trigger a radius-1 pointer that reads the j-th bit of an interior u-block positioned O(1) from S. The existence (extendibility) of a completion under probe Q_j equals that bit. Therefore the vector (ext_Q_j)_{j=1..B} encodes u, and different u yield different types. This avoids the flawed idea of “programming arbitrary boundary truth tables per type”.

Clean statements (to be proven/verified)
- Lemma A (Probe-bits). There exist global Cin–out, Cout–out and, for the left-side vertex-context shape W(u) (|W(u)|∈{ℓ_pump,ℓ_pump+1}), a fixed family of boundary-output 4-tuples {Q_j: j∈[B]} such that, for any boundary input assignment a, Gw:=W(u) has a legal completion with boundary outputs Q_j on its four boundary nodes iff the j-th bit of u equals 1. Consequently, Type(W(u))≠Type(W(u′)) for u≠u′.
  Why useful: Gives 2^B distinct vertex context types using only B=poly(s) probes, well within the β^4 boundary assignments. The construction is uniform and radius-1 (probes trigger a constant-symbol “probe role” that spawns a pointer reading the port region where u’s bits are pre-exposed near S; failures dead-end).
- Lemma B (Canonical vertex-context family). There exist two canonical context shapes L(u):=W_L(u) S F_R and R(v):=F_L S W_R(v) with |W_L(u)|,|W_R(v)|∈{ℓ_pump,ℓ_pump+1} and fixed fillers F_L,F_R (no vertex data) such that:
  (i) L(u) and R(v) are active (contain well-formed u- or v-blocks anchored O(1) from S),
  (ii) Type(L(u)) (resp. Type(R(v))) is determined by u (resp. v) via Lemma A, and
  (iii) any other context type without such a block is inactive: any non-⊥ color at S leads to a locally-detectable dead end; ⊥ always extends via neutral plumbing.
  Why useful: Ensures exactly one (or at least a unique canonical) type per vertex; non-vertex types force f(·)=⊥ by (F1) universal quantification.
- Lemma C (Bridge semantics for 3-coloring). There is a fixed, radius-1 seam gadget (placed across the concatenation of L(u) and R(v) in an (F1) instance) that locally simulates a universal TM U for poly(s) steps to evaluate D(u,v) using:
  (i) a copy of D stored in each block (copied from Σ_in via Cin–out), and
  (ii) the B-bit ports of u (on the right edge of L(u)) and v (on the left edge of R(v)).
  The bridge admits a completion iff [D(u,v)=0] or [D(u,v)=1 and the two S colors differ]. Malformed simulations are locally refutable (standard error-chain); spurious accept is impossible due to row-to-row radius-1 checks.
  Why useful: Matches (F1)’s universal pair check with “≠ on edges, trivial on non-edges”.

Sketch of constructions (radius-1 and uniform)
- Vertex block (near S): A constant-role phase track places a “port zone” of length Θ(B) immediately adjacent to S inside W_L(u) (to the right) and W_R(v) (to the left). This port zone carries the B bits (u_1,…,u_B) (resp. v) twice with parity/check bits; its layout is enforced by Cout–out (deterministic pattern given activation at S). The rest of the block includes a self-delimiting header and a RUN zone encoding U’s tableau on input D (copied from the input track) and the index, all standard and locally checkable.
- Probe patterns Q_j: Four special outputs on the boundary (two per side of the word) encode a “probe-bit j” token with local phase. Cout–out has rules: if a probe token sits on the boundary, the unique legal continuation from that boundary is a finite-state pointer that advances into the port zone, lands on the j-th cell, and requires its bit=1; otherwise no outgoing legal edge exists in the layered DP. This uses O(1) symbols and maintains radius-1 (pointer heads advance cell-by-cell with locally checkable direction and countdown in unary up to j encoded by constant number of “repeat until phase X” steps; the step count is derived by walking, not stored in boundary symbols). Result: extendibility under Q_j discriminates u_j.
- Bridge simulation: In wa S1 wb wc S2 wd with wa S1 wb=L(u), wc S2 wd=R(v), the seam region wb wc contains a fixed-width (poly(s)+O(B)) “bridge RUN” where U takes as inputs (D, u, v) read from the adjacent port zones and computes d:=D(u,v). Cout–out enforces single-step tableau constraints, with local error-escape allowed only for malformed inputs; a dedicated final row propagates d to a 1-bit flag near S2. Separate local rules check “if d=1 then colors at S1,S2 must be unequal; if d=0 then no constraint on colors”.

Correctness of the reduction (succinct 3-coloring ⇒ (F1) and vice versa)
- Completeness: If G is 3-colorable, fix χ: {0,1}^B→{RED,GRN,BLU}. Define f on vertex types by f(Type(L(u))) = χ(u) and f(Type(R(v))) = χ(v); define f(τ)=⊥ for all inactive (non-vertex) types. For any ordered pair of contexts in the (F1) check, either both are vertex-types (u,v): the bridge computes D(u,v) and enforces χ(u)≠χ(v) when D=1 (holds by proper coloring), or at least one is inactive, in which case ⊥ plumbing makes the DP succeed. Hence (F1) holds.
- Soundness: If some f satisfies (F1), read χ(u) := f(Type(L(u))). For any u,v with D(u,v)=1, the bridge between Type(L(u)) and Type(R(v)) must be extendible; the simulation forces χ(u)≠χ(v). Thus χ is a proper 3-coloring. Non-vertex types cannot be mapped to a color, else some pair (inactive, anything) would violate (F1) due to the local “colors-only-when-vertex” gating; therefore setting them to ⊥ is necessary and consistent.

Neutralizing (F2) and hardness for the tri-class classifier
- As in previous rounds, add a global ⊥-filler language permitted on repeated sides w_i^z independent of context; then (F2) is true for every f by Lemma 1 in output.md. Therefore the classifier answers O(1) iff (F1) holds, and Ω(n) otherwise (Theorem 8 machinery). Since feasible-function existence (mid-consistency) is NEXPTIME-hard by the reduction above and in NEXPTIME (output LCL_classification.pdf), the three-way classification is NEXPTIME-hard.

Examples and sanity checks
- Tiny case B=2: u∈{00,01,10,11}. Define Q_1,Q_2 probes. For the four left-contexts L(u), the 2-bit vector (ext_Q1, ext_Q2) equals u. The bridge runs D on pairs and requires color-inequality only on edges.
- DP perspective: The probe under Q_j forces a unique finite path in the layered automaton that reaches the j-th port cell; existence of an outgoing edge at that cell hinges on the bit=1. The bridge tableau likewise becomes a layered composition check; any inconsistency blocks all paths, so the DP precisely mirrors the existence of a legal completion.

Obstacles / things to make explicit next
- Probe pointer encoding: Make the boundary probe tokens and the in-block “port zone” phases explicit, with a table showing (current symbol, next symbol) pairs permitted by Cout–out. Verify that the pointer is guaranteed to stop on the exact j-th cell (walk semantics) without storing j in the boundary symbol (to keep alphabet constant).
- Seam I/O interface: Specify how the bridge RUN reads u and v: either by duplicating the B-bit ports directly adjacent to the bridge (preferred), or via pointers with locally checkable handshakes. The former is cleaner and fits ℓ_pump.
- Error-chain integration: Ensure malformed blocks are always completable via the error alphabet (like §3), and that the color-at-S activation is allowed only when the vertex role is present, preventing spurious constraints on inactive types.
- Size bookkeeping: Enumerate the tracks and show |Σ_out| = β = poly(s) suffices: roles/phases O(1), colors+⊥ (4), error alphabet O(1), U’s work tape O(1), plus finitely many probe/pointer states O(1). The “O(B)-long” ports are spatial, not alphabetic.

Gaps/notes on output.md
- The core lemmas (type bound, composition, periodicity, finite-Z, DP) are sound and sufficient for our verifier. Minor clarification: in Theorem 5 the DP assumes fixed input string; the construction adapts by restricting layer i to Cin–out[Input(i)]. No action needed.
- The bound Z≤ℓ^2 (Cor. 4) is non-tight but usable; we will carry it as-is for (F2) neutralization.

Next steps (auditable deliverables)
1) Formalize Lemma A with a concrete probe alphabet and Cout–out snippet; prove the “iff u_j=1” claim rigorously.
2) Specify the canonical L(u), R(v) layouts with exact offsets: positions of the port zones, header footprint, and RUN rows. Provide a bound O(poly(s)) for occupied length.
3) Write the seam tableau interface and prove Lemma C: that the only accepting completions correspond to the correct d = D(u,v) and enforce inequality when d=1.
4) Package the reduction C↦P_D, including ⊥-filler for (F2), and finalize the completeness/soundness argument with explicit references to the output lemmas (replacement, pumping) to guarantee existence of required contexts within lengths ℓ_pump or ℓ_pump+1.

## Round 0002 — 2025-08-28T11:48:05.813325Z

Ideas — pivot formalization via succinct 3-coloring and type separation
- Goal of this round: Make the NEXPTIME-hardness route auditable by (i) aligning (F1) semantics with a pairwise constraint problem (succinct 3-coloring), and (ii) pinning down a concrete, radius-1 mechanism that guarantees exponentially many distinct context types (one per vertex u ∈ {0,1}^B) even though f is defined on types (not concrete words). We state small lemmas with proof sketches and bookkeeping, and we flag minor clarifications for output.md.

Claim A (3-coloring matches (F1)). Why useful here: It resolves the quantifier mismatch that plagued 3SAT-style reductions; (F1) enforces universal pairwise constraints, exactly color(u) ≠ color(v) for edges.
- Source: Succinct 3-Coloring instance D: {0,1}^{2B} → {0,1}, circuit of size s; vertices V = {0,1}^B.
- Target semantics (mid-consistency (F1) only): Context types corresponding to vertices τ_u on both sides; the (F1) bridge between (τ_u, τ_v) must succeed (extend) iff either (i) D(u,v)=0 (non-edge; vacuous) or (ii) D(u,v)=1 and f(τ_u) ≠ f(τ_v).
- Implementation sketch: When S is colored, the bridge launches a row-by-row, radius-1-checked U-simulation on input (D,u,v) embedded in the inputs near the seam. Local rules guarantee: if D(u,v)=1 and colors equal, the bridge dead-ends; otherwise the bridge always extends. All other role pairings and inactive contexts allow trivial completions (⊥-plumbing). This aligns (F1) with 3-colorability.

Claim B (Type separation via boundary test family; B.1). Why useful here: Ensures at least 2^B distinct context types τ_u exist, allowing f to encode a color per vertex.
- Parameters: Choose integers B = s^{c0}, β = s^{c1} with 1 ≪ c0 ≪ c1 so that β ≥ B and ℓ_pump = 2^{Θ(β^4)} = 2^{poly(s)}.
- Reserved test boundary assignments: Fix one boundary-input 4-tuple a⋆. Reserve a collection J of size M := β distinct boundary-output 4-tuples {b_t : t ∈ [M]}; choosing b_t means “activate test id t”. All other boundary outputs are filler. This uses only O(β) reserved symbols (poly(s)).
- Input layout inside τ_u: The input track near the left end contains (i) a mask table row M_t ∈ {0,1}^B for each t ∈ [M] (packed contiguously and self-delimited), and (ii) a vertex-index block RID(u) ∈ {0,1}^B stored once in a fixed phase near S. The right end is symmetric or carries only fillers (not used for separation). We require well-formedness by radius-1 local rules; malformed encodings are locally refutable by error chains (as in §3 of the reference), hence “inactive.”
- Local test protocol: Under the boundary assignment (a⋆, b_t), the out–out rules enable a pointer that (1) walks from the left boundary to read the t-th mask row M_t, (2) walks to the RID block, and (3) computes parity ⟨M_t, u⟩ mod 2 using a fixed U-simulation in O(B) steps, all radius-1 checkable. If parity = 1, the pointer can terminate in an accepting sink; if parity = 0, no accepting continuation exists (the DP gets stuck). For all other boundary-output assignments (non-reserved), we permit a trivial completion (⊥ buffers) so they don’t affect separation.
- Linear independence: Pick M ≥ B masks whose rows form a full-rank B×M matrix over GF(2); since M=β ≥B, this is possible. Then the signature map Sig(u) := (⟨M_t,u⟩)_{t∈[M]} ∈ {0,1}^M is injective on {0,1}^B. For the fixed boundary-input a⋆, the extendibility table for reserved outputs is exactly E_{w(u)}(a⋆)[b_t] = Sig(u)_t. Consequently, u ≠ u′ ⇒ Type(w(u)) ≠ Type(w(u′)).
- Radius/size: The checker is constant-radius (pointers and row-to-row tableau), uses a constant work alphabet, with β = poly(s) large enough to host reserved symbols. The mask table sits in the input (binary) and is read by the pointer; malformed tables are harmless due to error chains.

Claim C (Realization of exponentially many vertex context types; B.2). Why useful here: Guarantees that, among contexts w_1 S w_2 with |w_i| ∈ {ℓ_pump, ℓ_pump+1}, there are at least 2^B distinct types representing all vertices u.
- Using Claim B, fix for each u an input string W(u) that realizes the left block (table + RID(u)), a neutral S, and a right filler block; ensure via pumping (Lemma 14/15) that both sides have length ℓ_pump or ℓ_pump+1 and that replacement preserves type (Lemma 11). Then Type(W(u)) are all distinct and populate C (the context-type domain for f). The same construction symmetrically realizes right-side vertex contexts τ_v.

Claim D (Bridge gating for succinct adjacency; B.3). Why useful here: Implements the pairwise constraint “if edge then colors differ, else vacuous” under (F1).
- Input near both sides supplies (i) a copy of D’s encoding (as in the LBA proof, stored in binary and copied by outputs), (ii) the local RID blocks (u and v). Upon non-⊥ colors at S, the bridge runs U on input (D,u,v) for poly(s) steps; rules enforce success as follows:
  • If the simulation yields D(u,v)=0 (non-edge), accept irrespective of colors by enabling a trivial acceptor after the run.
  • If D(u,v)=1 (edge), accept iff two color tokens at S are different; if equal, dead-end. The “color-different” test is purely local across the S seam.
- Robustness: Inactive/malformed blocks admit the standard error chains; colored S then cannot complete and hence forces f to map such types to ⊥.

Claim E (From (F1) to classification hardness; B.4). Why useful here: Transfers hardness from (F1)-feasibility to the 3-way decision by neutralizing (F2).
- Add a global ⊥-filler language for repetitions so that for any context (w_1,S,w_2) and any z≥1, w_1^z and w_2^z can be labeled with ⊥ (independent of inputs). Thus (F2) holds vacuously for any f. Therefore, deciding whether (F1) holds (i.e., whether G is 3-colorable) is as hard as the 3-way classification on our instances.

Proof sketches for soundness/completeness (FFE(F1) ↔ 3-coloring)
- Completeness: Given a proper 3-coloring χ: V → {RED,GRN,BLU}, define f(τ_u)=χ(u). For any pair (τ_u,τ_v), the bridge computes D(u,v); if non-edge it accepts; if edge, χ(u)≠χ(v) by proper coloring, so acceptance follows. Inactive contexts mapped to ⊥ are trivially satisfied.
- Soundness: If f satisfies (F1), define χ(u)=f(τ_u). For any edge (u,v), (F1) requires that the bridge succeeds; the only way it can succeed on edges is with χ(u)≠χ(v). Hence χ is a proper 3-coloring.

Instantiation details to verify next (concrete, checkable)
1) Pointer/test gadget (radius-1): Specify the constant-size out–out automaton for the test: states “go-to-row t”, “scan mask bits”, “accumulate parity”, “jump to RID”, “accumulate parity”, “accept if 1”; verify all transitions read-only from input and are nearest-neighbor.
2) Mask addressing with small boundary ID: Limit test IDs t to [β], each encoded by one of β reserved symbols. In input, arrange the mask table as β rows of length B with clear row delimiters; the “go-to-row t” stage follows row delimiters counted via the ID implicit in the chosen boundary symbol. Local rules ensure the pointer’s row-counter matches the selected symbol; wrong row ⇒ dead-end (so the DP cannot cheat by reading a different row).
3) Existence of contexts of length ℓ_pump: Use pumping/replacement to pad left/right to prescribed lengths without changing types, ensuring that (i) the reserved boundary tests remain available at the outermost two boundary nodes, and (ii) the interior test and RID regions remain intact.
4) Bridge TM: Use the same row-by-row U-simulation as in §3 to evaluate D(u,v) in poly(s) time. Errors are locally refutable; malformed inputs cannot permit a colored-S completion, making such contexts inactive.
5) Size bookkeeping: Σ_out tracks: roles/phases, 3 colors + ⊥, error alphabet, and U’s work alphabet are constant; plus β many reserved test symbols and a constant amount of plumbing. Tables Cin–out, Cout–out remain size poly(β)=poly(s). Input length is unbounded and holds the mask table, RID blocks, and circuit D wherever needed.

Toy example (sanity)
- Take B=2, β=8, masks M_t ∈ {00,01,10,11,01,10,11,00} (first 4 rows linearly independent). For u∈{00,01,10,11}, the reserved boundary outputs b_t induce an extendibility pattern equal to the parity vector across the first 4 tests; the four τ_u types differ on these 4 bits. On the bridge, if D is a 4-cycle adjacency, f(τ_u) = u mod 3 gives a valid coloring; pairs on edges with equal colors are forbidden locally.

Notes/obstacles
- Mask-table on input vs. grammar size: We deliberately read mask rows from input to avoid hardwiring O(β·B) bits into Cout–out; only the per-test control (β distinct boundary tokens) are baked into Cout–out.
- Dependence only on type: The separation relies on fixed boundary-input a⋆ and the reserved family {b_t}. For any two words with the same input content (table + RID) but otherwise different interiors, the existence or non-existence of a completion under (a⋆, b_t) is forced by the local test, hence is type-invariant. Distinct u’s yield distinct yes/no pattern across {b_t}, so types differ.
- Ensuring non-edges are vacuous: The bridge must accept for D(u,v)=0 irrespective of colors. We implement this by enabling a finishing acceptor after the U-run concludes “0”, independent of S’s colors.

Minor clarifications/suggestions for output.md
- Types and fixed inputs: In “Definitions (radius 1)”, clarify that E_w(a) is with respect to the fixed input string on the entire path; the parenthetical “interior inputs may be arbitrary” could be read as allowing the verifier to choose internal inputs. For our model, the input word is fixed; the extension existentially quantifies outputs only.
- Context set C size: Where LCL_classification.pdf states “Note |C| ≤ ℓ_pump,” consider adding a short justification: a context type is a specific element of the global type set T realized by a word of the form w_1 S w_2 with |w_i| ∈ {ℓ_pump,ℓ_pump+1}; hence |C| ≤ |T| = ℓ_pump.

Next steps
- Write the explicit local rule set for the boundary test gadget and prove the Type-Separation Lemma rigorously (injectivity from M≥B linearly independent masks).
- Specify the seam U-simulation interface and the local rule that gates acceptance by “D(u,v)=0 or colors differ.”
- Package the reduction formally: map D ↦ P_D with β=poly(s), prove “G 3-colorable ⇔ (F1)-feasible f exists”, and add the ⊥ repetition to neutralize (F2). This will give a clean NEXPTIME-hardness statement for the 3-way classification.

## round-0001 — model summary — 2025-08-28T11:43:33.807133Z
Goal: show NEXPTIME-hardness of the 3-way LOCAL classification for β-normalized, r=1 LCLs on oriented paths by reducing Succinct-3SAT to Feasible-Function Existence (F1). The last round (prover-04) gives a concrete reduction P_C: radius-1 gadgets (HEAD · RID · GID · RUN) plus an existential witness-chain that, when S is colored, nondeterministically selects an index i and locally verifies Hot_RID[i] and the clause bit V^{(±)}[i] via a row-by-row U-simulation. Key bounds: |Types| ≤ ℓ_pump = 2^{Θ(β^4)}, finite Z ≤ ℓ_pump^2 for (F2), and extension-check DP in O(k β^2). Neutralizing (F2) with a ⊥-filler transfers F1-hardness to the three-way classification. Correctness (completeness/soundness) sketched; remaining formal work: explicit radius-1 adjacency tables, witness-chain formalization, and a separability lemma proving distinct RID/GID yield distinct context types. Verifier verdict: partial success.

## round-0002 — model summary — 2025-08-28T11:52:38.260124Z
This round formalizes the reduction from Succinct 3-Coloring to Feasible-Function Existence for (F1) on β-normalized, radius-1 LCLs on paths. Main contributions: a radius-1 boundary-probe family Q_j that reads the j-th bit of a vertex index u (so extendibility under Q_j equals u_j), yielding ≥2^B distinct vertex context types; canonical left/right context shapes L(u), R(v) realizable at lengths ℓ_pump or ℓ_pump+1 whose types are determined by u/v; and a seam gadget that runs a universal TM U in the bridge to evaluate D(u,v) and exposes an Edge bit so the local seam enforces acceptance iff D(u,v)=0 or (D(u,v)=1 and the two S-colors differ). Adding ⊥-plumbing makes (F2) vacuous, so the 3-way classification reduces to (F1)-feasibility (hence NEXPTIME-hard). The verifier returned “partial success”: the construction is conceptually complete but key local rule tables and small-radius verification details remain to be written.

Working model and notation (radius 1, β-normalized)
- We study LCLs on globally oriented paths with fixed input alphabet Σ_in and output alphabet Σ_out of size β. The local legality is given by two global relations: Cin–out relating each input symbol to allowed output symbols at a node, and Cout–out relating allowed pairs of consecutive output symbols. The radius is 1.
- A path segment w has four boundary nodes (two on the left, two on the right). For a fixed assignment to the four boundary inputs, we define the extendibility bitvector over all β^4 assignments to the four boundary outputs indicating for which boundary-output assignments there exists a legal extension to the interior.
- The type Type(w) is the collection, over all 4-boundary input assignments, of these extendibility bitvectors. Two words share a type if they have identical extendibility behavior for all boundary input/output assignments. Let T be the finite set of all types realizable by some word.

Verified technical facts (recorded in output.md)
- Type bound: |T| ≤ |Σ_in|^4 · 2^{β^4}. Reason: a type is determined by four boundary input symbols and a Boolean function on the β^4 boundary output assignments.
- Composition lemma: There is a computable binary operation ⊛ on T such that Type(uv) = Type(u) ⊛ Type(v) for all words u, v. Intuition: to decide extendibility of uv under a boundary-output assignment, one needs only (i) the extendibility tables of u and v, and (ii) existentially quantify over the two internal boundary outputs to satisfy Cout–out at the join.
- Periodicity: For any fixed word w, the sequence τ_z := Type(w^z) is ultimately periodic with preperiod and period ≤ |T|. Thus the pair sequence (Type(w1^z), Type(w2^z)) is ultimately periodic with preperiod ≤ 2|T| and period ≤ |T|.
- Finite-Z for (F2): Given any context (w1, S, w2), whether the (F2) check passes for all z ≥ 1 depends only on finitely many pairs (Type(w1^z), Type(w2^z)); it suffices to check z up to Z ≤ |T|^2 (a non-tight but simple bound).
- DP for extension: For a fixed path with some outputs forced (e.g., on S), the existence of a global completion can be decided in O(k β^2) time for a length-k path by a layered dynamic program over output symbols.

Hardness direction we will pursue (pivot suggested by Prover 01)
- Source problem: Succinct 3-Coloring of a graph G on V={0,1}^B, given by a circuit D(u,v) (size s) deciding adjacency; NEXP-complete.
- Target LCL: Construct a β-normalized, r=1 instance P_D with Σ_out size β = poly(s). The plan:
  1) For each u, build at least one context type τ_u whose boundary behavior (detected via a reserved boundary-probe) certifies that the interior encodes the index u in a standard, radius-1-checkable block. The interior also stores a copy of D on an input track and a runzone for a fixed TM U.
  2) In a bridge between τ_u and τ_v, locally simulate U on input (D,u,v) across the seam for poly(s) steps to evaluate D(u,v); malformed simulations are locally refutable.
  3) Gate constraints: if D(u,v)=0 (non-edge) allow completion regardless of colors; if D(u,v)=1 enforce color inequality across S. All other pairings (not recognized as vertex–vertex) are trivial.
  4) Assigning a color to each τ_u by a feasible function f is then exactly a proper 3-coloring of G.
  5) Make (F2) vacuous by allowing repeated sides to be filled with a globally available ⊥-plumbing language.

Open technical items for hardness (to be formalized next)
- Boundary-probe/type-separation lemma: Exhibit a fixed boundary-output probe that, when used, triggers an interior index-check subroutine; show that for distinct indices u ≠ u′, the probe’s extendibility bit differs, hence τ_u ≠ τ_{u′}.
- Seam handshake and computation: Specify the constant-size interface by which the bridge accesses (via pointers) the interior encodings of u and v and runs the 1D tableau for U for poly(s) steps, with radius-1 local checks and robust error refutations.
- Alphabet/size bookkeeping: Keep Σ_out constant tracks (roles, colors, error, U’s work alphabet) constant, with β = poly(s) sufficient for all auxiliary symbols.
- Soundness/completeness proof for the reduction P_D: G is 3-colorable iff a feasible f exists for P_D (with (F2) neutralized).

Caveats and corrections logged
- Short seam codes cannot distinguish exponentially many indices; instead use constant-size pointers/handshakes plus interior blocks that store and validate indices.
- Do not attempt to “program arbitrary boundary truth tables per type” via Cout–out; all rules are global. Use boundary probes plus uniform interior checks to separate types.
- For 3SAT-based reductions, the (F1) universal quantifier clashes with clause-level existential quantification unless one adds complex nondeterministic gating. The succinct 3-coloring pivot avoids this.
Refined hardness plan via Succinct 3-Coloring: type separation and seam simulation (radius 1)

Parameters and normalization
- Given a succinct graph instance D of size s over V={0,1}^B with B=s^{c0}, choose β=s^{c1} with c1≥c0 so β≥B and the output alphabet Σ_out has size β. The LCL instance P_D has radius 1 and is β-normalized (Cin–out global, Cout–out nearest-neighbor global). The DP and type framework from output.md applies with |T|≤|Σ_in|^4·2^{β^4}.

Canonical vertex contexts and activity gating
- We will construct canonical context shapes L(u)=W_L(u) S F_R and R(v)=F_L S W_R(v) for each u,v∈{0,1}^B such that:
  1) W_L(u) (resp. W_R(v)) is a well-formed vertex block anchored O(1) from S; it exposes a port zone of length Θ(B) immediately adjacent to S holding the index bits.
  2) Only these canonical contexts permit color tokens at S (role gating). Any context that is not a canonical vertex context is inactive: any non-⊥ token at S dead-ends locally; ⊥ at S always extends via neutral plumbing.
  3) For each u (resp. v) the type Type(L(u)) (resp. Type(R(v))) depends only on u (resp. v) via a boundary-probe mechanism detailed below. Thus we obtain at least 2^B distinct left-types and 2^B distinct right-types.

Type separation via a family of boundary probes (two workable options)
- Option A (per-bit probes Q_j with address field): Reserve B distinct boundary-output 4-tuples {Q_j : j∈[B]}. In the port zone, include an address track Addr∈[B] and a data track RID∈{0,1}. Local rules enforce that under boundary outputs Q_j the only legal continuation is a deterministic pointer that walks from the boundary to the unique port cell with Addr=j and then accepts iff RID=1 at that cell; otherwise no continuation exists. For all non-reserved boundary outputs we allow generic ⊥-plumbing so they do not affect separation. Fix a boundary-input pattern a⋆. Then for each u we have E_{L(u)}(a⋆)[Q_j]=u_j. Consequently, u≠u′ implies Type(L(u))≠Type(L(u′)). This uses O(B) extra symbols (addresses/pointer states) and remains within β=poly(s).
- Option B (mask/parity probes with M≥B tests): Reserve M boundary-output 4-tuples {b_t : t∈[M]} with M≥B. Store in the input of W_L(u) a table of M masks M_t∈{0,1}^B (with the B×M matrix of full rank over GF(2)) and the RID block u. Under boundary outputs b_t, a deterministic pointer reads M_t and then the RID block and accumulates the inner product ⟨M_t,u⟩ mod 2 using a small “RUN” zone (row-by-row locally checked). Accept iff the parity is 1. Define Sig(u)=(⟨M_t,u⟩)_t∈{0,1}^M; Sig is injective because M≥B and the masks are independent. Fixing a boundary-input a⋆, E_{L(u)}(a⋆)[b_t]=Sig(u)_t, so types differ for distinct u. Again, the probe behavior is radius-1 and β=poly(s) suffices.
- In both options, under reserved probes the control is deterministic (no error-chain escape). Outside reserved probes, error-chains and ⊥-plumbing ensure malformed interiors do not constrain f.

Seam gadget for succinct adjacency and color inequality
- In an (F1) instance on L(u) seam R(v), the bridge wb∘wc hosts a row-by-row simulation of a fixed TM U that evaluates D(u,v) in poly(s) steps:
  1) The port zones adjacent to S on each side expose the B-bit strings u and v. A small handshake track opens a corridor through wb∘wc where U’s tableau is laid out.
  2) Cout–out enforces nearest-neighbor consistency between successive rows; malformed rows are locally refutable (no accepting continuation). The run emits a verdict bit EDGE∈{0,1} at a fixed place near S.
  3) Local acceptance: If EDGE=0 (non-edge), admit completion irrespective of colors at S; if EDGE=1 (edge), admit completion iff the two color tokens at the two S nodes differ. These are radius-1 checks.
- If either side is inactive (not a canonical vertex context), a ⊥-plumbing language allows completion irrespective of the other side and the colors; however, the role gating forbids colors at S for inactive types, so mapping inactive types to a color would violate (F1) on some pair.

Neutralizing (F2)
- Add a global ⊥-filler that, for any context (w_1,S,w_2) and any z≥1, allows filling w_1^z and w_2^z entirely with ⊥ symbols, consistent with any boundary outputs and inputs, without altering the two S positions or the vertex-role gating. Then (F2) holds for every f, reducing the 3-way classification on this family to (F1)-feasibility.

Why this matches our DP/type framework
- Types are defined with respect to fixed inputs; the reserved-probe acceptance depends only on the interior index u and the chosen boundary 4-tuple, so it is type-invariant. The DP in O(kβ^2) can verify both probe behavior and seam runs on small test instances (e.g., B=2), giving a concrete auditable path.

Key cautions to enforce in the local rules
- Reserved probes must have a unique legal continuation (deterministic pointer/run); no error-chain may provide an alternative accepting path.
- Color tokens at S must be gated by the vertex role; inactive contexts cannot place colors, ensuring f is only free on canonical vertex types and ⊥ elsewhere.
- The seam gadget must accept for non-edges regardless of colors and enforce inequality for edges; malformed simulations must not accept.

Minimal sanity check (B=2)
- Use Option A with Q_1,Q_2 and an Addr track {1,2} in the port zone. For u∈{00,01,10,11}, the vector (E_{L(u)}(a⋆)[Q_1], E_{L(u)}(a⋆)[Q_2]) equals u. The seam gadget with a small circuit D (e.g., a 4-cycle) enforces inequality exactly on edges, which can be brute-forced by the DP.

Results validated for radius-1, β-normalized LCLs on oriented paths

Why these results matter
- The decision procedures for feasible-function existence (and hence the O(1)/Θ(log* n)/Θ(n) classification on paths) rely on two ingredients: (i) that path segments admit a finite set of “types” which compose under concatenation, and (ii) that extendibility of partially labeled paths can be checked efficiently. The theorems below formalize these facts for radius 1 and yield a finite bound for the bridging (F2) checks.

Definitions (radius 1)
- Fix finite alphabets Σ_in and Σ_out (|Σ_out| = β). Cin–out ⊆ Σ_in × Σ_out specifies allowed output symbols at a node given its input symbol. Cout–out ⊆ Σ_out × Σ_out specifies allowed pairs of consecutive output symbols along the oriented path. A labeling of outputs y_1…y_k over an input x_1…x_k is legal if (x_i, y_i) ∈ Cin–out for all i and (y_i, y_{i+1}) ∈ Cout–out for all i.
- For a word w of length k ≥ 2, let the four boundary positions be i=1,2 and i=k-1,k. For a fixed assignment a ∈ Σ_in^4 to the boundary inputs (x_1, x_2, x_{k-1}, x_k), define E_w(a) ⊆ Σ_out^4 to be the set of boundary-output assignments b = (y_1, y_2, y_{k-1}, y_k) for which there exists a legal output labeling y_1…y_k extending b, given the boundary inputs a (interior inputs may be arbitrary in Σ_in; if the model fixes interior inputs, the definition is with respect to those fixed inputs). The type of w, Type(w), is the map a ↦ E_w(a). Let T be the set of all types realized by some w.

Theorem 1 (Finite number of types and an explicit bound)
Let m := |Σ_in|. For radius 1 we have |T| ≤ m^4 · 2^{β^4}.
Proof. For each fixed boundary-input assignment a there are exactly β^4 possible boundary-output assignments; E_w(a) is an arbitrary subset of these, hence at most 2^{β^4} possibilities. There are m^4 possible a’s. The type is fully determined by the tuple (a, E_w(a))_{a∈Σ_in^4}. Thus the total number of distinct types is at most m^4 · 2^{β^4}.

Lemma 2 (Composition of types under concatenation)
There is a computable binary operation ⊛: T × T → T such that for all words u, v we have Type(uv) = Type(u) ⊛ Type(v).
Proof. Fix boundary inputs a on uv, i.e., inputs on positions 1,2 and at the last two positions of uv. For each boundary-outputs choice b on uv, extendibility is equivalent to the existence of output symbols p,q ∈ Σ_out at the shared boundary between u and v (the last two outputs of u = first two of v) such that:
- (i) (Type(u) under its corresponding boundary inputs) accepts the boundary outputs given by the left two outputs of b together with p,q; and
- (ii) (Type(v) under its corresponding boundary inputs) accepts p,q together with the right two outputs of b; and
- (iii) the two internal adjacencies across the u|v seam are allowed by Cout–out (these involve only (y_{|u|-1}, y_{|u|}) = (p_left, p_right) and (p_left, p_right) = (y_1, y_2) of v, but these are exactly the p,q we quantify over).
Because radius is 1, no other interior constraints couple u and v. Thus extendibility of uv under (a,b) can be decided solely from Type(u), Type(v), and Cout–out by existentially quantifying p,q. Defining ⊛ to implement this decision for all (a,b) yields Type(uv) = Type(u) ⊛ Type(v).

Lemma 3 (Ultimate periodicity of repeated concatenation)
Fix w and let τ := Type(w). Define the sequence σ_1, σ_2, … in T by σ_z := Type(w^z). Then σ_{z+1} = σ_z ⊛ τ for all z ≥ 1. Consequently, the sequence (σ_z) is ultimately periodic with preperiod and period at most |T|.
Proof. By Lemma 2, σ_{z+1} = Type(w^{z+1}) = Type(w^z w) = Type(w^z) ⊛ Type(w) = σ_z ⊛ τ. Since T is finite, the sequence must revisit a previous value within at most |T| steps, after which it evolves deterministically with fixed period ≤ |T|.

Corollary 4 (Finite bound for the bridging (F2) check)
Let ℓ := |T|. Fix a context (w_1, S, w_2) with |S| = 2 and a forced output assignment s ∈ Σ_out^2 on S. For each z ≥ 1, consider the path w_1^z S w_2^z with S fixed to s, and let P(z) be the predicate “there exists a legal completion of outputs on w_1^z and w_2^z consistent with s.” Then P(z) depends only on the pair (Type(w_1^z), Type(w_2^z)). Moreover, it suffices to check P(z) for 1 ≤ z ≤ Z with Z ≤ ℓ^2; if all these hold then P(z) holds for all z ≥ 1.
Proof. For fixed s, feasibility is determined by whether there exist outputs on the two boundary nodes adjacent to S on each side such that the two segments extend and Cout–out holds across the two adjacencies touching S; this depends only on Type(w_1^z) and Type(w_2^z). By Lemma 3, each of the two type sequences is ultimately periodic with preperiod and period ≤ ℓ. Hence the pair sequence (Type(w_1^z), Type(w_2^z)) takes values in a set of size ≤ ℓ^2 and is ultimately periodic. If P(z) holds for one full traversal of the distinct pairs (which occurs within the first ℓ^2 indices), it holds for all subsequent z.

Theorem 5 (DP for extension on a partially labeled path)
Given a path of length k with a fixed input string and some outputs preassigned on a subset of nodes, there is an O(k β^2) time algorithm that decides whether the outputs can be completed to a legal labeling.
Proof. Construct a layered graph with k layers, each layer’s vertices being the output symbols allowed at that node by Cin–out and any preassignment. Add a directed edge from y at layer i to y′ at layer i+1 iff (y, y′) ∈ Cout–out. There exists a legal completion iff there is a path from some vertex in layer 1 to some vertex in layer k. The graph has O(k β) vertices and O(k β^2) edges; reachability is decidable in O(k β^2).

Remarks
- The bounds above are not tight (e.g., the ℓ^2 bound in Corollary 4 can be improved using lcm of periods), but they suffice for verification in exponential time in β. They also isolate exactly where only the types matter (composition and periodicity), which is crucial for hardness reductions that aim to make (F2) vacuous and focus on (F1).

Abstract. Consider a computer network that consists of a path with n nodes. The
nodes are labeled with inputs from a constant-sized set, and the task is to ﬁnd output
labels from a constant-sized set subject to some local constraints—more formally, we
have an LCL (locally checkable labeling) problem. How many communication rounds
are needed (in the standard LOCAL model of computing) to solve this problem?
It is well known that the answer is always either O(1) rounds, or Θ(log∗n) rounds,
or Θ(n) rounds. In this work we show that this question is decidable (albeit PSPACE-
hard): we present an algorithm that, given any LCL problem deﬁned on a path,
outputs the distributed computational complexity of this problem and the corresponding
asymptotically optimal algorithm.

Introduction
To what extent is it possible to automate the design of algorithms and the study of computational
complexity? While algorithm synthesis problems are typically undecidable, there are areas of
theoretical computer science in which we can make use of computational techniques in algorithm
design—at least in principle, and sometimes also in practice. One such area is the theory of
distributed computing; see [3, 5, 6, 9, 11, 17, 19, 26] for examples of recent success stories. In this
work we bring yet another piece of good news:
Consider this setting: there is a computer network that consists of a path with n nodes, the
nodes are labeled with inputs from a constant-sized set, and the task is to ﬁnd output labels from
a constant-sized set subject to some local constraints. We show that for any given set of local
constraints, it is decidable to tell what is the asymptotically optimal number of communication
rounds needed to solve this problem (as a function of n, for the worst-case input).
Background: LCLs and the LOCAL Model.
We focus on what are known as LCL (locally
checkable labeling) problems [22] in the LOCAL model of distributed computing [20, 24]. We deﬁne
the setting formally in Section 2, but in essence we look at the following question:
• We are given an unknown input graph of maximum degree ∆= O(1); the nodes are labeled
with input labels from a constant-size set Σin, and the nodes also have unique identiﬁers from
a polynomially-sized set.
• The task is to label the nodes with output labels from a constant-size set Σout, subject to
some local constraints P; a labeling is globally feasible if it is locally feasible in all radius-r
neighborhoods for some r = O(1).
• Each node has to produce its own output label based on the information that it sees in its
own radius-T(n) neighborhoods for some function T.
Here the local constraints P deﬁne an LCL problem. The rule that the nodes apply to determine
their output labels is called a distributed algorithm in the LOCAL model, and function T(n) is the
running time of the algorithm—here T(n) determines how far a node has to see in order to choose
its own part of the solution, or equivalently, how many communication rounds are needed for each
node to gather the relevant information if we view the input graph as a communication network.
In this setting, the case of T(n) = Θ(n) is trivial, as all nodes can see the entire input. The
key question is to determine which problems P can be solved in sublinear time—here are some
examples:
• Vertex coloring with ∆+ 1 colors: can be solved in time O(log∗n) [8, 16] and this is tight
[20, 21].
• Vertex coloring with ∆colors, for ∆> 2: can be solved in polylogarithmic time [23] and
requires at least logarithmic time [7] for deterministic algorithms.
While the study of this setting was initiated already in the seminal work by Naor and Stockmeyer
in 1995 [22], our understanding of these questions has rapidly advanced in the past three years
[1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 12–15, 25]. The big surprises have been these:
1

--- Page 3 ---
• There are LCL problems with inﬁnitely many diﬀerent time complexities—for example, we
can construct LCL problems with a time complexity exactly Θ(nα) for any rational number
0 < α ≤1.
• Nevertheless, there are also wide gaps in the complexity landscape: for example, no LCL
problem has a (deterministic) computational complexity that is between ω(log∗n) and o(log n).
However, what is perhaps most relevant for us is the following observation: if we look at the case
of ∆= 2 (paths and cycles), then the time complexity of any LCL problem is either O(1), Θ(log∗n),
or Θ(n), and the same holds for both deterministic and randomized algorithms [5, 6, 22].
Decidability of LCL Time Complexities.
For a ﬁxed ∆, any LCL problem has a trivial ﬁnite
representation: simply enumerate all feasible radius-r local neighborhoods. Hence it makes sense to
ask whether, given an LCL problem, it is possible to determine its time complexity. The following
results are known by prior work:
• If the input graph is an unlabeled path or cycle, the time complexity is decidable [5, 22].
• If the input graph is a grid or toroidal grid, the time complexity is undecidable [22]. However,
there are also some good news: in unlabeled toroidal grids, the time complexity falls in one of
the classes O(1), Θ(log∗n), or Θ(n), it is trivial to tell if the time complexity is O(1), and it
is semi-decidable to tell if it is Θ(log∗n) [5].
• In the case of trees, there are inﬁnitely many diﬀerent time complexities, but there is a gap
between ω(log n) and no(1), and it is decidable to tell on which side of the gap a given problem
lies [6].
Somewhat surprisingly, the seemingly simple case of labeled paths or cycles has remained open all
the way since the 1995 paper by Naor and Stockmeyer [22], which deﬁned LCLs with inputs but
analyzed decidability questions only in the case of unlabeled graphs.
We initially expected that the question of paths with input labels is a mere technicality and the
interesting open questions are related to much broader graph families, such as rooted trees, trees,
and bounded-treewidth graphs. However, it turned out that the main obstacle for understanding
decidability in any such graph family seems to lie in the fact that the structure of the graph can be
used to encode arbitrary input labels, hence it is necessary to ﬁrst understand how the input labels
inﬂuence decidability—and it turns out that this makes all the diﬀerence in the case of paths.
In this work we show that the time complexity of a given LCL problem on labeled paths or
cycles is decidable. However, we also show that decidability is far from trivial: the problem is
PSPACE-hard, as LCL problems on labeled paths are expressive enough to capture linear bounded
automata (Turing machines with bounded tapes).
2
Model
The LOCAL Model.
The model of computation we consider in this work is the LOCAL model of
distributed computing [20, 24]. In the LOCAL model, each node of the input graph is considered as
a computational entity that can communicate with the neighboring nodes in order to solve some
given graph problem. Computation is divided into synchronous rounds, where in each round each
node ﬁrst sends messages of arbitrary size to its neighbors, then receives the messages sent by
its neighbors, and ﬁnally performs some local computation of arbitrary complexity. Each node is
equipped with a globally unique identiﬁer (ID) which is simply a bit string of length O(log n), where
2

--- Page 4 ---
n denotes the number of nodes of the input graph. In the beginning of the computation, each node
is aware of its own ID, the number of nodes and the maximum degree ∆of the input graph, and
potentially some additional problem-speciﬁc input. Each node has to decide at some point that it
terminates, upon which it returns a local output and does not take part in any further computation;
the problem is solved correctly if the local outputs of all nodes together constitute a global output
that satisﬁes the output constraints of the given problem.
Each node executes the same algorithm; the running time of the distributed algorithm is the
number of rounds until the last node terminates. It is well known that, due to the unbounded
message sizes, an algorithm with runtime T(n) can be equivalently described as a function from
the set of all possible radius-T(n) neighborhoods to the set of allowed outputs. In other words, we
can assume that in a T(n)-round algorithm, each node ﬁrst gathers the topology of and the input
labels contained in its radius-T(n) neighborhood, and then decides on its output based solely on
the collected information.
Locally Checkable Labelings.
The class of problems we consider is locally checkable labeling
(LCL) problems [22]. LCL problems are deﬁned on graphs of bounded degree, i.e., we will assume
that ∆= O(1). Formally, an LCL problem is given by a ﬁnite input label set Σin, a ﬁnite output
label set Σout, an integer r, and a ﬁnite set C of graphs where every node is labeled with a pair
(ℓin, ℓout) ∈Σin × Σout and one node is marked (as the center). Each node of the input graph
is assigned an input label from Σin before the computation begins, and the global output of a
distributed algorithm is correct if the radius-r neighborhood of each node v, including the input
labels given to the contained nodes and the output labels returned by the contained nodes, is
isomorphic to an element of C where v corresponds to the node marked as the center.
In the case of directed paths as our class of input graphs, we are interested in identifying the
simplest possible form of LCL problems. For this purpose, we deﬁne β-normalized LCLs; these are
problems for which the input is just binary, and the size of the set of output labels is β. Moreover, the
solution can be checked at each node v by just inspecting the input and output of v, and, separately,
the output of v and the output of its predecessor. More formally, a β-normalized LCL problem is
given by ﬁnite input and output label sets Σin, Σout satisfying |Σin| = 2, |Σout| = β, a ﬁnite set
Cin −out of pairs (ℓin, ℓout) ∈Σin × Σout and a ﬁnite set Cout −out of pairs (ℓout, ℓ′
out) ∈Σout × Σout.
The global output of a distributed algorithm for the β-normalized LCL problem is correct if the
following hold:
• For each node v, we have (Input(v), Output(v)) ∈Cin −out, where Input(v) denotes the input
label of v, and Output(v) the output label of v.
• For each node v that has a predecessor, we have (Output(v), Output(u)) ∈Cout −out, where u is
the predecessor of v, and Output(v), Output(u) are the output labels of v and u, respectively.
It is straightforward to check that a β-normalized LCL problem is indeed a special case of an LCL
problem where r = 1.

Hardness
In this section we study the hardness of determining the distributed complexity of LCLs on paths
and cycles with input labels. More precisely, we start by proving the existence of a family Π of
LCL problems for consistently globally oriented paths, such that, given an LCL problem in Π, it is
PSPACE-hard to decide if its distributed complexity is O(1) or Θ(n). Our main result shows the
following.

Figure 1: Illustration of a correct encoding of the execution of an LBA on a path; black nodes act as separators
between the encoding of two consecutive steps of the LBA; in the example, the LBA executes a unary counter.
It is PSPACE-hard to distinguish whether a given LCL problem P with input labels can be
solved in O(1) time or needs Ω(n) time on globally oriented path graphs.
The high level idea of the proof of the above result is as follows. We would like to encode the
execution of Turing machines as LCLs on consistently oriented paths, and then deﬁne some LCL for
which the complexity depends on the running time of the machine. This is fairly easy on oriented
grids, for example, where we can use one dimension of the grid as a tape, and the other dimension
as time. One may try to do the same on paths, by projecting everything on a single dimension,
concatenating the tape state of each step. Unfortunately, the obtained encoding is not locally
checkable, since the length of the tape may be non-constant. Hence, in order to guarantee the local
checkability, we should consider Turing machines having a tape of size at most B, where B is a
constant with respect to the number of nodes in the path where we want to encode its execution.
For this purpose, we consider Linear Bounded Automata (LBA) [18, p. 225]. An LBA is a Turing
machine that has a tape of size upper bounded by some B. We show that, if B is constant with
respect to the number of nodes in the path, we can then encode the execution of an LBA MB as
an LCL for directed paths. Moreover, we show that by seeing this encoding as a two party game
between a prover and a disprover, we can encode the execution of MB using labels of constant size
that do not depend on B, even in the case in which the LCL checkability radius is 1. If the execution
of MB is not correctly encoded in the input of the LCL, then we can disprove its correctness using
output labels of size O(B). Moreover, we ensure that, if the execution of MB is correctly encoded
in the input of the LCL, it is not possible to produce a correct proof of non-correctness. Then, in
order to obtain an LCL with a distributed complexity that depends on the execution time of MB,
we encode some secret input at the ﬁrst node of the path. We require then that all nodes involved
in a correct encoding must produce the same secret as output.
Figure 1 shows an example of an LBA that executes a unary counter, and its encoding as input
to nodes on a path. In this instance, all nodes must produce the symbol a as output. Figure 2 shows
an example of the wrong input (the tape has been copied incorrectly between two consecutive steps

of the LBA). In this case, nodes are allowed to produce a chain of errors. Diﬀerent types of errors
will be handled using diﬀerent types of error labels. In the example, all nodes that produce the
error chain, output E2, indicating an error of type 2. We will show that we need O(B) symbols to
handle all possible errors (including the case in which the input tape is too long, way more than B).
Also, it is necessary that all error chains that we allow as outputs must be locally checkable.
Another interesting problem is to identify, for an LCL that can be distributedly solved in constant
time, how big this constant can be. In particular, we ﬁrst focus on identifying the simplest possible
description of an LCL, and then, we provide a lower bound on the complexity of a constant time
LCL, as a function of the size of the LCL description. For this purpose, we consider β-normalized
LCLs, i.e., problems for which the input labeling is just binary and there are β possible output
labels. Also, the veriﬁer for these LCLs is the simplest possible: it can only check if the output of a
node is correct w.r.t. its input, and separately, if the output of a node is correct w.r.t. the output of
its predecessor. Therefore, we show how to convert an LCL to a β-normalized one by encoding the
input in binary (Figure 3 shows an example), and obtain the following result.
There are β-normalized LCLs that can be solved in constant time but the distributed time
complexity is 2Ω(β).
All results that we have been described so far apply to globally oriented paths. Nevertheless, we
show that ideas and techniques can be generalized to work on undirected path and cycles as well,
obtaining essentially the same results. Finally, we will show how to lift these results to trees without
input labels, proving the following result.
It is PSPACE-hard to distinguish whether a given LCL problem P without input labels can be
solved in O(1) time or needs Ω(n) time on trees with degree ∆= 3.

Linear Bounded Automata
A Linear Bounded Automata MB is a Turing Machine having a bounded tape of size at most B,
such that it is able to recognize the boundaries of the tape [18, p. 225]. More formally, we deﬁne an
LBA as a tuple of 5 elements M = (Q, q0, qf, Γ, δ), where
• Q is a ﬁnite set of states;
• q0 ∈Q is the initial state;
• qf ∈Q is the ﬁnal state;
• Γ is a ﬁnite set of tape alphabet symbols that contains integers 0, 1, and special symbols L
(left), and R (right);
• δ is the transition function, where δ: Q \ {qf} × Γ →Q × Γ × {−, ←, →}.
The tape of MB is initialized as follows:
• the ﬁrst cell is marked with the symbol L;
• the last cell is marked with the symbol R;
• all other cells contain an integer in {0, 1}.
An execution of an LBA is a sequence (stepi | i ∈{1, . . . , t}), where
• stepi = (statei, tapei, headi);
• statet = qf;
• δ(statei, tapei[headi]) = (statei+1, tapei+1[headi], ϵ), and headi+1 is
– headi −1 if ϵ is ←;
– headi if ϵ is −;
– headi + 1 if ϵ is →.
3.2
The LCL Problem
We deﬁne a family Π of LCLs, in which each problem ΠMB depends on the LBA MB. The general
idea is that the input of the LCL may encode the execution of an LBA MB. If it is the case, nodes
are required to solve a problem that requires a time proportional to the execution time of MB. On
the other hand, if it is not the case, nodes can produce an output that proves that this encoding is
wrong. In order to deﬁne valid LCLs, we consider the case where B = O(1), that is, the size of the
tape does not depend on the size of the distributed network.
3.2.1
Input Labels
We deﬁne the input labels of our LCL as follows:
• Start(φ), where φ ∈{a, b}, indicates a symbol that will be used as some kind of secret;
• Separator, a label that acts as a separator between two steps of MB;
• Tape(c, s, h) gives information about the tape and the state of MB, where the content c ∈
{0, 1, L, R}, the state s ∈Q, and the head h ∈{true, false};
• Empty, indicating an empty input.
Note that the size of the set of possible input labels does not depend on the size B of the tape.

3.2.2
Encoding an LBA on a Path
Suppose we have a consistent global orientation in the path P = (p0, p1, p2, . . . , pn−1). Let step =
 stepi = (statei, tapei, headi) | i ∈{1, . . . , t}

be the execution of the LBA MB starting from a tape
initialized with (L, 0, . . . , 0, R).
Deﬁnition 1. The input of the LCL is a good input if the ﬁrst node of the path has in input
Start(φ), where φ ∈{a, b}, and the rest of the path correctly encodes the execution of an LBA MB
initialized with (L, 0, . . . , 0, R) (see Figure 1). More precisely:
• Input(p0) = Start(φ);
• Input(p(i−1)(B+1)+1) = Separator for i ∈1, . . . , t;
• Input(p(i−1)(B+1)+1+j) = Tape(c, s, h) for i ∈1, . . . , t, j ∈{1, . . . , B}, where
– c = tapei[j];
– s = statei;
– h = true if headi = j, otherwise h = false;
• All other nodes have in input Empty.
3.2.3
Output Labels
The set of output labels is the following.
• Start(φ);
• Empty;
• Error: a generic error label;
• Error0(i) where 0 ≤i ≤B + 1: an error of type 0 indicating that the machine is not correctly
initialized;
• Error1(i), where 0 ≤i ≤B: an error of type 1 that we will use in the case where the size of
the tape is not correct, i.e., when the size of the tape is not B;
• Error2(x, i), where x ∈{0, 1, L, R} and 0 ≤i ≤B + 1: an error of type 2 used when the tape
of MB is wrongly copied;
• Error3: an error of type 3 is used in case nodes have inconsistent states;
• Error4(current state, tape content, i), where 0 ≤i ≤B + 2: an error of type 4 indicating that
the transition of MB is encoded incorrectly (this error captures also the case where the head
is missing);
• Error5(x) where x ∈{0, 1}: an error of type 5 used in the case when there is more than one
head.
3.2.4
LCL Constraints
The high level idea is the following. If the path encodes a good input, then nodes that are not
labeled Empty are required to output the input given to the ﬁrst node of the path (either a or b).
Otherwise, nodes can produce a locally checkable proof of an error (see Figure 2 for an example).
While nodes may output a or b even in the case in which the input is not a good input, nodes
must not be able to produce a proof error in the case in which the path encodes a good input. We
describe all these requirements as locally checkable constraints.
An output labeling for problem ΠMB is correct if the following conditions are satisﬁed for nodes
of the path P = (p0, . . . , pn−1). Note that, although nodes do not know their position on the path,
for the sake of simplicity we will denote with pi−1 the predecessor of pi, if it exists.

1. Each node v produces exactly one output label.
2. If Output(v) = Empty then Input(v) = Empty.
3. If v has no predecessors (i.e., v = p0) and Output(v) = Start(φ), then Input(v) = Start(φ).
4. If Output(pi−1) = a then Output(pi) ̸= b, and if Output(pi−1) = b then Output(pi) ̸= a.
5. If Output(pi) = Error0(j), then
• if j = 0 then the node has no predecessor;
• if j > 0 then Output(pi−1) = Error0(j −1).
6. If Output(pi) = Error1(j), then
• if j = 0, then Input(pi) = Separator;
• if j > 0 then Input(pi) ̸= Separator and Output(pi−1) = Error1(j −1).
7. If Output(pi) = Error2(x, j), then
• if j = 0, then Input(pi) = Tape(c, s, h) where h = false, c = x;
• if j = B + 1 then Input(pi) = Tape(c, s, h) where c ̸= x;
• if 0 < j < B + 1 then Output(pi−1) = Error2(x, j −1).
8. If Output(pi) = Error3, then Input(pi) = Tape(c, s, h), Input(pi−1) = Tape(c′, s′, h′), and s ̸= s′.
9. If Output(pi) = Error4(current state, tape content, j), let (transition state, new content, ϵ) =
δ(current state, tape content)
• if j = 0, then Input(pi) = Tape(c, s, h) where c = tape content, s = current state, h = true;
• if j = B and ϵ = ←, or j = B +1 and ϵ = −, or j = B +2 and ϵ = →(i.e., if node pi is an
“Error4 ﬁnal node”), then either current state is a ﬁnal state or Input(pi) = Tape(c, s, h)
where s ̸= transition state or h = false;
• otherwise, then Output(pi−1) = Error4(current state, tape content, j −1).
10. If Output(pi) = Error5(x)
• if Output(pi−1) ̸= Error5 then Input(pi) = Tape(c, s, h) where h = true and x = 0.
11. If Output(pi) = Error then one of the following condition holds:
• Input(pi) ̸= Start(φ) and pi has no predecessors;
• Input(pi) = Start(φ) and pi has a predecessor;
• Input(pi−1) or Output(pi−1) is Empty;
• Output(pi−1) = Error;
• Output(pi−1) = Error0(j), j > 0, and
– if j = 1 then Input(pi−1) ̸= Separator;
– if j ≥2 then either Input(pi−1) ̸= Tape, or Input(pi−1) = Tape(c, s, h) and:
∗if j = 2 either c ̸= L, or s ̸= q0 or h = false;
∗if 2 < j ≤B either c ̸= 0, or s ̸= q0 or h = true;

∗if j = B + 1, either c ̸= R, or s ̸= q0 or h = true;
• Input(pi) = Separator and Output(pi−1) = Error1(x) where x ̸= B;
• Input(pi) ̸= Separator and Output(pi−1) = Error1(B);
• Output(pi−1) = Error2(x, j) where j = B + 1;
• Output(pi−1) = Error3;
• pi−1 is an “Error4 ﬁnal node”;
• Output(pi−1) = Error5(x) and Input(pi−1) = Tape(c, s, h) where h = true and x = 1.
12. If Output(pi) is of type Errorx, then Output(pi−1) must not be of type Errory where y ̸= x.
The following property directly holds by deﬁnition of the constraints.
Property 1. Each node is able to locally check all constraints by just inspecting its own input and
output, and the ones of its predecessor (if it exists).
3.3
Upper Bound on the Complexity of the LCL
We need to consider two possible scenarios: either MB terminates within time T, or MB loops. In
the case in which MB loops, we show a simple O(n) algorithm that solves the LCL ΠMB. As we
know, any problem for which a solution exists can be solved in O(n) rounds in the LOCAL model by
gathering all the graph and solving the problem locally. There always exists a solution for problem
ΠMB if MB loops, in fact:
• If Input(p0) = Start(φ), then all nodes output φ, even if there are errors in the machine
encoding.
• Otherwise, if Input(p0) ̸= Start(φ), all nodes output Error.
It is easy to see that this output satisﬁes the LCL constraints described above.
Suppose that MB terminates. In this case, we show how to solve the LCL problem ΠMB in
constant time. More precisely, if MB terminates in T rounds, we show a distributed algorithm that
solves ΠMB in T ′ = 2+(B +1)T rounds. Each node v starts by gathering its T ′-radius neighborhood
Bv(T ′). Notice that, by deﬁnition, if the input is a good input, then for each node v that is taking
part in the encoding of the execution of MB (i.e., Input(v) ̸= Empty), Bv(T ′) contains p0. Hence, if
a node v does not see p0 after gathering its ball Bv(T ′), it means that the input is not a good input.
So, after gathering its T ′-radius ball, each node v does the following.
• If Input(v) = Empty, then Output(v) = Empty.
• If Bv(T ′) does not contain p0, or if Input(p0) ̸= Start(φ), then v outputs Error.
• If Bv(T ′) is a good input, then v outputs Start(φ).
The remaining case that we still need to handle is when Bv(T ′) contains p0, Input(p0) = Start(φ),
but Bv(T ′) does not look like a good input. We want nodes to produce a proof of an error in some
consistent way. Thus, we show that nodes can identify the ﬁrst error and produce a proof based on
that. First of all, notice that, since v sees the ﬁrst node in the path, v can compute its position i on
the path. Also, node v can identify who is the ﬁrst node u not satisfying the constraints of being a
good input. Let j be the position of u in the path, that is u = pj. Now we distinguish the following
cases based on Bu(B + 2) (the output of each node will be determined by the ﬁrst case encountered
in the following list).
9

--- Page 11 ---
1. If Input(pj) = Start(φ) and j ̸= 0, then, if i < j, Output(v) = Start(φ); otherwise Output(v) =
Error.
2. If j ≤B + 1, it means that either the initial state is encoded incorrectly, or the tape is not
initialized correctly, or the head is not initialized on the correct position. In this case, if i ≤j,
then Output(v) = Error0(i), otherwise Output(v) = Error.
3. If Input(pj−(B+1)) = Separator and Input(pj) ̸= Separator, then the length of the tape is too
long, and u expected to have in input Separator. Then, if i < j −(B +1), Output(v) = Start(φ);
if i > j then Output(v) = Error; otherwise, Output(v) = Error1(i −j + B + 1).
4. If Input(pj) = Separator and there exists a k such that 1 ≤j −k < B + 1 such that
Input(pk) = Separator, then the length of the tape is too short, and u did not expect to have a
separator. In this case, if i < k then Output(v) = Start(φ); if i ≥j then Output(v) = Error;
otherwise Output(v) = Error1(k −i).
5. If Input(pj−(B+1)) = Tape(c, s, h) where h = false, c = x, and Input(pj) = Tape(c′, s′, h′), where
c′ ̸= x, then the tape of MB has been copied incorrectly. In this case, if i < j −(B + 1), then
Output(v) = Start(φ); if i > j then Output(v) = Error; otherwise, Output(v) = Error2(x, i −j +
B + 1).
6. If Input(pj) = Tape(c, s, h) and Input(pj−1) = Separator and there exists a k < j + B such
that Input(pk) = Tape(c′, s′, h′) and that s ̸= s′, it means that nodes have inconsistent states.
Consider the minimum k satisfying the constraints. If i < k then Output(v) = Start(φ); if
i > k then Output(v) = Error; otherwise, Output(v) = Error3.
7. If none of the above is satisﬁed, it means that there exist a k satisfying j −k ≤B +2, such that
Input(pk) = Tape(c, s, h) and h = true. Let (transition state, new content, ϵ) = δ(s, c). It holds
that if ϵ is ←, −, or →, then j−k is respectively B, B+1, or B+2. If Input(pj) = Tape(c′, s′, h′),
where either h′ = false, or transition state ̸= s′, or s is a ﬁnal state, then there is some
error in the transition (this captures also the case where there is no head). If i < k, then
Output(v) = Start(φ); if i > j then Output(v) = Error; otherwise, Output(v) = Error4(s, c, k−i).
Notice that this case captures also the one where the head is missing.
8. If Input(pj) = Tape(c, s, h) where h = true, since all the above cases are not satisﬁed, it means
that there exists a k, such that Input(pk) = Tape(c′, s′, h′), h′ = true, |j −k| < B and all nodes
pmin(j,k), . . . , pmax(j,k) are labeled with some Tape. That is, there are at least two heads, one
on node pj and one on node pk. In this case, if i < min(j, k), then Output(v) = Start(φ); if
i > max(j, k) then Output(v) = Error; if i = min(j, k) then Output(v) = Error5(0), otherwise
Output(v) = Error5(1).
If the path encodes a good input, every node taking part in the encoding of the execution of MB
outputs Start(φ), and in this case it is easy to see that the output satisﬁes the LCL constraints.
Therefore, assume that the path does not correctly encode the execution of MB starting from
the correct tape content. First of all, notice that the algorithm handles all possible errors in the
machine encoding, that is, if the input is not good, at least one case of the list applies. Consider
all nodes v that do not have in input Empty, that is, all nodes taking part in the encoding of the
execution of MB. If node v sees the ﬁrst node p0, i.e., if the distance between p0 and v is at most
T ′ (notice that a good input has length T ′), then it is easy to see that the output satisﬁes the LCL
constraints. Some care is needed in the case where a node v outputs a generic error Error and v
does not see p0: we need to show that also in this case the output is valid, meaning that the LCL
10

--- Page 12 ---
constraints are satisﬁed. In this case, the distance between p0 and v is strictly greater than T ′, and
since the encoding of the execution of MB is not correct, then
• either the path (p0, . . . , v) does not correctly encode the execution of MB,
• or MB is not correctly initialized and it loops.
In the ﬁrst case, some node on the path between p0 and v will output some speciﬁc error Errorx where
x > 0, while in the second case initial nodes will output Error0. In both scenarios the constraints for
Error are satisﬁed. The complexity of the algorithm is O(B · T).
3.4
Lower Bound on the Complexity of the LCL
Let us deﬁne T ′′ as follows. If MB terminates in time T, then T ′′ = T ′ = 2 + (B + 1)T. If MB loops,
then T ′′ = n. We prove a lower bound on the complexity of ΠMB of Ω(T ′′) rounds, by showing that
Ω(T ′′) rounds are needed in the case where the input is a good input. In particular, we show that,
in a good input, for all nodes v such that Input(v) ̸= Empty, Output(v) must be Start(φ). The result
then comes from the fact that, for some nodes, it requires Ω(T ′′) rounds in order to see if φ = a or
φ = b.
First of all, we ignore nodes that have in input Empty since, in a good input, they are at distance
at least T ′′ + 1 from p0, the ﬁrst node of the path. Hence, assume that a node v not having Empty in
input does not output Start(φ). In this case, v can either output a generic error Error, or a speciﬁc
error Errorx. If all nodes output Error, the veriﬁer rejects on p0. If all nodes, starting from a node
pi where i > 0, output Error, and all nodes pi′ with i′ < i output Start(φ), then the veriﬁer rejects
on pi. Therefore, let us assume that there is at least a node that outputs a speciﬁc error Errorx. We
write succ(v) and dist(u, v) to denote respectively the successor of a node v in the path, and the
distance between two nodes u and v in the path.
• If x = 0, the veriﬁer accepts only if this error produces a chain that starts from p0 and
proceeds with increasing values. In order to be accepted, this chain must end at a node w′,
and succ(w′) must output Error. Then, succ(w′) must witness that w′ indeed has a local error
in the machine initialization, which is not possible in a good input.
• If x = 1, we could have two cases:
– there is a chain of increasing values that starts from a node w with Input(w) = Separator,
and ends on a node w′ such that dist(w, w′) < B, Input(succ(w′)) = Separator, and
Output(succ(w′)) = Error (the tape is too short);
– there is a chain of increasing values that starts from a node w with Input(w) = Separator,
and ends on a node w′ such that dist(w, w′) = B, Input(succ(w′)) ̸= Separator, and
Output(succ(w′)) = Error (the tape is too long).
Since, in a good input, the distance between two nodes having in input Separator is always
B + 1, the above scenarios are not possible.
• If x = 2, there must be a chain of length exactly B + 1, starting from a node w having
Input(w) = Tape(c, s, h), where c = x ∈{0, 1}, h = false, and ending on a node w′ such that
dist(w, w′) = B + 1, and Input(w′) = Tape(c′, s′, h′), where c′ ̸= x. In a good input, the tape
content of nodes w and w′ must be the same.
• If x = 3, it means that there must exist two neighbors having two diﬀerent states, and this
can not happen in a good input.
11

--- Page 13 ---
• If x = 4, there must be a chain that propagates the old state and old input, and the veriﬁer
accepts only if acknowledges that the transition has been wrongly encoded, which can not the
case in a good input.
• If x = 5, there must be a chain of length at least 2 not passing through nodes having in input
Separator, starting from a node w with Input(w) = Tape(c, s, h) where h = true, and ending
on a node w′ with Input(w′) = Tape(c′, s′, h′) where h′ = true. This is not possible on a good
input.
Therefore, since nodes can not output any kind of error, and since Empty is not a valid output for
the nodes encoding the LBA, then these nodes must output Start(φ), where the value of φ matches
the input of the ﬁrst node of the path. Hence, ΠMB requires Ω(T ′′).
3.5
Normalizing an LCL Problem
We now show how to β-normalize an LCL ΠMB and obtain a new LCL having roughly the same time
complexity. We deﬁne three diﬀerent veriﬁers depending on their view.
• A Vin,in −out,out veriﬁer running at node v, checks Input(v), Input(pred(v)), Output(v), and
Output((pred(v)).
• A Vin −out veriﬁer running at node v, checks Input(v) and Output(v).
• A Vout −out veriﬁer running at node v checks Output(v) and Output((pred(v)).
Lemma 2. Consider an LCL P with |ΣP
in| = α and |ΣP
out| = β that can be solved in time T and can
be locally checked with a Vin,in −out,out veriﬁer. It is possible to deﬁne an LCL P′ such that |ΣP′
in | = α
and |ΣP′
out| = α · β that can be solved in time T and can be locally checked with a Vin −out and a
Vout −out veriﬁer.
Proof. We deﬁne ΣP′
in = ΣP
in, and ΣP′
out = ΣP
out × ΣP
out. Let Output(v) = (in, out) ∈ΣP′
out. Let
Output(pred(v)) = (in′, out′) ∈ΣP′
out. The Vin −out veriﬁer checks that Input(v) = in. The Vout −out
veriﬁer acts the same as the Vin,in −out,out veriﬁer executed on ((in′, out′), (in, out)). The LCL problem
P′ can be solved with the following algorithm at each node v.
• Gather the ball Bv(T).
• Simulate the original algorithm on Bv(T); let out be the output of this simulation.
• Output (Input(v), out).
It is easy to check that this output is valid for the problem P′, and that it requires T rounds. Also,
note that it is not possible to solve P′ faster than T. In fact, in order to satisfy the Vin −out veriﬁer,
the input must be copied correctly; while in order to satisfy the Vout −out veriﬁer, we need to satisfy
the Vin,in −out,out veriﬁer executed giving the same input that it would have seen on P.
Lemma 3. Consider an LCL P with |ΣP
in| = α and |ΣP
out| = β that can be solved in time T and can
be locally checked with a Vin −out and a Vout −out veriﬁer. We can deﬁne a β′-normalized LCL P′
with β′ = |ΣP′
out| = 2γ · (|ΣP
out| + 3) that can be solved in time Θ(γ · T(n/γ)), where γ = 2⌈log α⌉+ 3.
Proof. In the following we will exploit the ability of an algorithm to work on identiﬁers that can
be polynomial in the size of the graph. In particular, we assume that if an algorithm works on an
instance with IDs in the range 1, . . . , r, then it works also on an instance with IDs in the range
1, . . . , γ · r. Then, we show how to deﬁne an LCL P′ such that:
• if the input instance encodes a virtual instance for the problem P, it is required to solve P on
the virtual instance;
12

--- Page 14 ---
• otherwise, it is required to prove that the encoding is wrong.
Let V′
in −out and V′
out −out be the veriﬁers of our β′-normalized LCL.
Encoding P in P′.
We start by deﬁning how to encode an instance of P of size n, as an
instance of P′ of size N = γ · n. We denote with p0, . . . , pn−1 and p′
0, . . . , p′
γ·n−1 respectively the
instance of P and the one of P′. Let a = ⌈log α⌉. For the sake of simplicity, let us rename nodes
p′
γi, . . . , p′
γ(i+1)−1, where 0 ≤i ≤n −1, as qi
0, . . . , qi
2a+2 (notice that 2a + 2 = γ −1). The ﬁrst a + 1
nodes, qi
0, . . . , qi
a, have input 1, while nodes qi
a+1 and qi
2a+2 have input 0. Each of the remaining a
nodes, qi
a+2, . . . , qi
2a+1, has in input one bit of the binary representation of Input(pi), in some ﬁxed
order (see Figure 3 for an illustration).
The V′
in −out Veriﬁer.
The set of output labels of P′ is ΣP′
out = 2γ × (Σout ∪{Er, E, El}). Let qi
j
be a node of the instance of P′ where 0 ≤i ≤n −1 and 0 ≤j ≤2a + 2. Let Input(qi
j) ∈{0, 1}, and
let Output(qi
j) = ((b0, . . . , b2a+2), out) ∈ΣP′
out. The V′
in −out veriﬁer running at qi
j checks that
• Input(qi
j) = b0, and
• if out ∈ΣP
out, then
– if all bits in b0, . . . , ba are 1s, checks that the original Vin −out veriﬁer accepts on
(x, out), where x is obtained by recovering the input pi for the original algorithm from
ba+2, . . . , b2a+1.
The V′
out −out Veriﬁer.
Let the output of pi
j be ((b0, . . . , b2a+2), out) ∈ΣP′
out and the output of
the predecessor of pi
j be ((b′
0, . . . , b′
2a+2), out′) ∈ΣP′
out The O-O veriﬁer ﬁrst checks that
• b0 = b′
1, b1 = b′
2, . . . , b2a+1 = b′
2a+2, and
• if out ∈ΣP
out and out′ ∈ΣP
out, then
– if at least one bit in b0, . . . , ba is 0 , then out = out′,
– if all bits in b0, . . . , ba are 1s, then check that the original Vout −out executed on (out′, out)
accepts.
Dealing with Errors.
We now add some constraints to handle the case in which out /∈
ΣP
out. Let the output of pi
j be ((b0, . . . , b2a+2), out) and the output of the predecessor of pi
j be
((b′
0, . . . , b′
2a+2), out′). The V′
in −out veriﬁer additionally checks that, if out = E, then the encoding is
not locally valid, that is,
• either
– there are two numbers x, y ≥0, x + y ≤a, such that b0, . . . , bx−1 and b2a+3−y, . . . , b2a+2
are all equal to 1, bx = 0, b2a+2−y = 0, and
– there is not a contiguous sequence of length a + 1 of all 1s in b0, . . . , b2a+2,
• or b0, . . . , ba are all 1s but either ba+1 ̸= 0 or b2a+2 ̸= 0.
The V′
out −out veriﬁer running on pi
j additionally checks that,
• if out = El, then pi
j must have a predecessor, and it must hold that out′ /∈{Er} ∪ΣP
out;
• if out ∈ΣP
out, if pi
j has a predecessor, then out′ must be diﬀerent from Er;
• if out = Er, then pi
j must have a successor.
13

--- Page 15 ---
Let N be the size of the graph. An algorithm solving P′ in (γ + 1) · T rounds does the following at
each node v′:
• Gather the ball Bv′((γ + 1) · T).
• If Bv′((γ + 1) · T) looks like a correct encoding of an input instance of P
– let u′ be the nearest left node having input 1 and other a successors, succ(1)u′, . . . , succ(a)u′,
having also input 1
– Compute the virtual instance for P (setting the IDs to be the same of the nodes satisfying
the above)
– Simulate the original algorithm on the virtual instance by setting n = N/γ, let out be
the output of u′
– Output ((Input(v′), Input(succ(1)v′), . . . , Input(succ(γ−1)v′), out)
• Otherwise,
– if there is a local error, output E
– if the nearest error is on the left, output El
– otherwise, output Er
It is easy to check that the output of the algorithm satisﬁes the constraints. In order to show a
lower bound for the new LCL, we now show that it is not possible to produce errors in a graph
that is a valid encoding. In fact, nodes can not cheat by wrongly outputting the input of the
neighbors, otherwise either the input-output veriﬁer notices inconsistencies on the ﬁrst bit, or the
output-output veriﬁer notices inconsistencies on the other bits. Then, on a valid encoding, no input
satisﬁes the constraints that allows to produce E as output. Finally, the constraints impose that a
chain of Er or El points to a node that is outputting E.
Note that, if the original LCL has complexity T, then the new LCL, on instances of size N = γ ·n,
has complexity Θ(γ(T(n))) = Θ(γ · T(N
γ )).

Hardness Results
Theorem 4. There are β-normalized LCLs that can be solved in constant time but the distributed
time complexity is 2Ω(β).
Proof. The complexity of ΠMB is Θ(B · T) if MB terminates in T steps.
|Σin| = O(1) and
|Σout| = Θ(B). We can convert it to an LCL where |Σin| = 2, |Σout| = Θ(B), and the complexity is
still Θ(B · T). There exist LBAs that terminate in 2Θ(B) steps (e.g. a binary counter). Thus, the
complexity of the obtained LCL is Θ(B · 2Θ(B)), that is 2Ω(B) = 2Ω(|Σout|) = 2Ω(β).
Theorem 5. It is PSPACE-hard to distinguish whether a given LCL problem P with input labels
can be solved in O(1) time or needs Ω(n) time on globally oriented path graphs.
Proof. It is PSPACE-hard to distinguish whether a given LBA terminates or loops (see e.g. [10]).
Note that the description of a β-normalized LCL has size O(β2). In order to decide if a β-normalized
version of a problem in Π requires O(1) or Ω(n) we need to decide if its associated LBA, running on
a tape of size B = Θ(β), terminates or loops, and this implies the theorem.
14

3.7
Extending the Results to Undirected Cycles
We show how to extend the above results, which apply to globally oriented paths, to the case where
the input graph is an undirected path or an undirected cycle. We ﬁrst focus on showing how to
adapt these results to undirected paths. Given a β-normalized LCL P deﬁned on directed paths,
we can deﬁne an LCL P′ in which the set of input labels is Σ′
in = {0, 1} × {0, 1, 2}, and the set of
output labels is Σ′
out = {0, 1, 2} × {1, . . . , β, E}. Let Vin −out and Vout −out be the veriﬁers of the
β-normalized LCL P, and let V′
in −out and V′
out −out be the veriﬁers of the LCL P′. The idea is that
we can use 3 symbols to give an orientation as input to the nodes, by giving 0 to the ﬁrst node, 1 to
the second, 2 to the third, 0 to the fourth, and so on. Nodes must copy their orientation number to
the output, and then, if the given orientation is consistent, nodes are required to solve the original
problem P. On the other hand, if the orientation is not consistent, nodes are allowed to output an
error E. Also, in order to avoid the need of error pointers, we allow nodes to treat the places where
the orientation is not consistent, as a place where the path ends.
This new LCL can be checked as follows. The V′
in −out veriﬁer takes in input the input and
the output of the current node (as before) and ﬁrst checks that the orientation has been copied
correctly, and then checks that the original Vin −out veriﬁer accepts. To verify the output, we allow
the V′
out −out veriﬁer to see slightly more than the original veriﬁer Vout −out. The V′
out −out veriﬁer
sees a triple containing the output of the node and the outputs of its neighbors. Note that the
veriﬁer does not know the orientation of the path (and the orientation of the triple), but it can
recover it from the output of the nodes (that contains a copy of the orientation given as input).
Then the V′
out −out veriﬁer checks that, if the node outputted E, the orientation is indeed wrong. If
the output is a value in 1, . . . , β, the veriﬁer V′
out −out runs the original Vout −out veriﬁer, since it
can compute which neighbor is the predecessor. It is easy to see that the complexity of P′ is the
same as the one of P.
The LCL description of P′, that is, the size of its input, its output, and its veriﬁer, is now O(β3),
therefore the hardness result still applies.
We now show how an LCL for paths can be converted to an LCL for cycles. The idea is the
following. On a cycle, we give an additional input to each node in {0, 1}. Nodes marked as 1 are
exempt to solve the problem and act as separators between the other nodes. That is, nodes are
required to solve the original problem on the subpaths that lie between nodes marked as 1. It may
be the case that no node has 1 as input. In this case we allow nodes to output a special error. If a
node decides to output this error, both its neighbors must output the same, that is, all nodes must
output the same. We impose the constraint that a node marked as 1 can not output this error. A
worst case instance would be the one in which one node is marked 1 and all other nodes are marked
0—this would represent a path with a length that is roughly equal to the one of the cycle. There
is one case that requires a bit of care: if all nodes are marked 0, but the original problem can be
solved in sublinear time, nodes could not be able to coordinate to produce the special error. For our
purpose, it is possible to check that, if we consider the problem ΠMB previously deﬁned in the case
in which MB terminates, in an instance in which nobody has a predecessor, nodes can eﬃciently
solve the problem by just outputting Error or Empty, depending on their input.
3.8
Encoding Input Labels as Trees
In this section we demonstrate a reduction from the LCL problem P with input labels on any graph
G to an LCL problem P⋆without input labels on the modiﬁed graph G⋆. The modiﬁed graph G⋆
is the result of attaching a rooted tree to each v ∈V (G) that encodes the input label of v for the
LCL problem P. The reduction allows us to extend the hardness proof to the case of LCL problems
15

--- Page 17 ---
without input labels.
Encoding.
Given a 2k-bit binary string S = (s1, . . . , s2k), deﬁne Enc(S) as the rooted tree
constructed as follows.
• Begin with the full binary tree which has 2k leaves, and the distance from the root to each
leaf is k.
• For each non-leaf node v, let u be any one of its two children, and subdivide the edge {v, u}
into two edges {v, w} and {w, u}, where w is a new node. The node w is designated as the
left child of v.
• Let U = (u1 . . . , u2k) be the leaves ordered by the in-order traversal.
• For each i ∈[2k], add two new nodes x and y as the children of ui. If si = 1, add two more
new nodes x′ and y′ and the two edges {x, x′} and {y, y′}.
The tree Enc(S) has maximum degree 3, and all nodes are within distance 2(k + 1) to the root.
Given a graph G such that each node v ∈V (G) is associated with an input label L(v) ∈Σin, deﬁne
G⋆as the graph resulting from the following operations on G. For each node v ∈V (G), attach the
rooted tree T = Enc(L(v)) to v by adding the edge {v, z}, where z is the root of T. Notice that
∆(G⋆) = max{3, ∆(G) + 1}.
Decoding.
Given a rooted tree T = Enc(S) for some S ∈{0, 1}2k, deﬁne Dec(T) = S. The
decoding can be done by the following procedure. Consider an in-order traversal of the tree such
that (i) for each node v such that exactly one of its children w has degree 2, treat w as the left child
of v, (ii) print ‘1’ if a node that has two children of degree 2 is encountered, (iii) print ‘0’ if a node
that has two children of degree 1 is encountered. Then the printed sequence is S.
The Modiﬁed LCL Problem P⋆.
Let P be an LCL problem with input labels. Suppose that
the radius of P is r, and the maximum degree is ∆. Set k = ⌈log log |Σin|⌉, and let each label in Σin
be represented by a distinct 2k-bit string. The modiﬁed LCL problem P⋆, which does not require
input label, is deﬁned by the following rules. The set of the output labels of P⋆is Σout, the same as
that of P. Let G⋆be a graph with maximum degree ≤∆+ 1.
• Deﬁne G1 = G⋆.
For each 2 ≤i ≤k + 2, deﬁne Gi as the graph induced by nodes in V (G⋆) −Si−1
j=1(Aj ∪Bj).
For each i ∈[k + 2], deﬁne Ai = {v ∈V (Gi)| degGi(v) = 1}.
For each i ∈[k + 1], deﬁne Bi = {v ∈V (Gi)| degGi(v) = 2 and ∃u ∈Ai s.t. {u, v} ∈E(Gi)}.
• Deﬁne Vlabel = Sk+2
j=1 Aj ∪Sk+1
j=1 Bj.
Deﬁne Vmain as the set of nodes in V (G⋆) \ Vlabel that have exactly one neighbor in Vlabel.
• For each v ∈Vmain, deﬁne L(v) as follows. Let u be the unique node in Vlabel adjacent to
v, and let T be the connected component induced by nodes in Vlabel that contains u. Set
L(v) = Dec(T) (with u being the root of T). If the decoding procedure Dec(T) fails, simply
set L(v) as the ﬁrst label in Σin.
• The output labeling, together with the input labeling deﬁned by the function L(·), forms a
legal labeling of the subgraph induced by the nodes in Vmain for P.
16

--- Page 18 ---
Notice that the connected components in Vlabel are the trees encoding input labels, and the subgraph
induced by the nodes in Vmain is G (as long as G does not contain isolated node). The function L(v)
recovers the input label of v for each v ∈V (G). Given that P has a valid labeling on all graphs
(resp., trees) of maximum degree ∆, the modiﬁed LCL problem P⋆also has a valid labeling on all
graphs (resp., trees) of maximum degree ∆+ 1.
Reducing the Radius.
The above deﬁnition of P⋆requires radius r + O(k), as a node v ∈Vmain
needs O(k) extra rounds to calculate L(u) for all u ∈Nr(v)∪Vmain. We present a simple modiﬁcation
that reduces the radius to only r + O(1) at the cost of expanding the number of output labels from
|Σout| to |Σout| + 22k < |Σout| + |Σin|2. The idea is to let nodes in Vlabel to use output labels to
pass the information stored at the leaves to the root based on local rules. Consider a connected
component T induced by nodes in Vlabel. The subgraph T is interpreted as a tree rooted at the
unique node in T that is adjacent to some node in Vmain.
Base Case: Let v ∈A2. If v is adjacent to two nodes in B1, the output label of v is 1; otherwise
the output label of v is 0.
Root / Degree-3 Nodes: Let 3 ≤i ≤k + 2, and let v ∈Ai. Then v has a unique neighbor
uleft ∈Bi+1 and a unique neighbor uright ∈Ai+1. Let Sleft be the output label of uleft, and let
Sright be the output label of uright. Then the output label of v is the binary string Sleft ◦Sright.
Degree-2 Nodes: Let 3 ≤i ≤k + 1, and let v ∈Bi. Then v has a unique neighbor u ∈Ai+1. The
output label of v is the same as the output label of u.
Thus, for each node v ∈Vmain, L(v) is simply the output label of the unique node u ∈Vlabel ∩N(v).
Theorem 6. For any LCL problem P on any graph G of maximum degree ∆that does not have
isolated nodes, the following two statements are equivalent.
• The labeling L: V (G) →Σout is a valid labeling of G for the problem P.
• There exists some labeling L′ of the nodes in Vlabel such that L and L′ together form a valid
labeling of G⋆for the problem P⋆.
Theorem 7. It is PSPACE-hard to distinguish whether a given LCL problem P without input labels
can be solved in O(1) time or needs Ω(n) time on trees with degree ∆= 3.
4
Decidability
In this section, we show that the two gaps ω(1)—o(log∗n) and ω(log∗n)—o(n) for LCL problems
with input labels on paths and cycles are decidable. More speciﬁcally, given a speciﬁcation of an
LCL problem P, there is an algorithm that outputs a description of an asymptotically optimal
deterministic LOCAL algorithm for P, as well as its time complexity.
We will prove the statements for the case of cycles, but the analogous results for cycles and paths
follows as a simple corollary, as we can encode constraints related to degree-1 nodes as constraints
related to nodes adjacent to a special input label. Furthermore, having a promise that the input is
a path does not change the time complexity of an LCL problem: if a problem can be solved in time
T = o(n) in labeled paths, the same algorithm will solve it also in time T = o(n) in labeled cycles.
The proof of Theorem 8 is in Section 4.2; the proof of Theorem 9 is in Section 4.5.
17

--- Page 19 ---
Theorem 8. For any LCL problem P on cycle graphs, its deterministic LOCAL complexity is either
Ω(n) or O(log∗n). Moreover, there is an algorithm that decides whether P has complexity Ω(n)
or O(log∗n) on cycle graphs; for the case the complexity is O(log∗n), the algorithm outputs a
description of an O(log∗n)-round deterministic LOCAL algorithm that solves P.
Theorem 9. For any LCL problem P on cycle graphs, its deterministic LOCAL complexity is either
Ω(log∗n) or O(1). Moreover, there is an algorithm that decides whether P has complexity Ω(log∗n)
or O(1) on cycle graphs; for the case the complexity is O(1), the algorithm outputs a description of
an O(1)-round deterministic LOCAL algorithm that solves P.
Graph Notation.
For convenience, in this section, a directed path P with input labels is
alternatively described as a string in Σk
in, where k > 0 is the number of nodes in P. Similarly,
an output labeling L of P is alternatively described as a string in Σk
out. In subsequent discussion,
we freely switch between the graph-theoretic notation and the string notation. Given an output
labeling L of P, we say that L is locally consistent at v if the input and output labeling assigned to
Nr(v) is acceptable for v. Note that Nr(v) refers to the radius-r neighborhood of v. Given two
integers a ≤b, the notation [a, b] represents the set of all integers {a, a + 1, . . . , b}. Given a string
w, denote wR as the reverse of w.
Overview.
Before we proceed, we brieﬂy discuss the high level idea of the proofs. The main tool
underlying the proofs is the “pumping lemma” which was developed in [6]. Intuitively, we classify
the set of all input-labeled paths into a ﬁnite number of equivalence classes satisfying the following
property. Let P be a subpath of G, and let P ′ be another path that is of the same equivalence
class as P. Given a complete legal labeling of G, if we let G′ be the result of replacing P with
P ′, then it is always possible to extend this partial labeling of G′ to a complete legal labeling by
appropriately labeling P ′. The pumping lemma guarantees that for any path P whose length is
at least the pumping constant ℓpump, and for any number x ≥ℓpump, there is another path P ′ of
length at least x and P ′ is of the same equivalence class as P.
Informally, in the proof of Theorem 8, we show that any LCL problem P solvable in o(n) rounds
can be solved in O(log∗n) rounds in the following canonical way based on a “feasible labeling
function” f. Intuitively, a labeling function f is feasible if for any given independent set I that is
suﬃciently well-spaced, we can apply f to assign the output labels to each v ∈I and its nearby
neighbors locally such that this partial labeling can always be extended to a complete legal labeling.
The ω(log∗n)—o(n) gap and the decidability result follows from these two claims.
• If there is an o(n)-round algorithm A that solves P, then a feasible function f exists. This
is proved by ﬁrst create an imaginary graph where some paths are extended using pumping
lemmas, and then apply a simulation of A on the imaginary graph.
• Whether a feasible function exists is decidable. Intuitively, this is due to the fact that the
number of equivalence classes is ﬁnite.
The proof of Theorem 9 is a little more complicated since the time budget is only O(1), so
we cannot even aﬀord to ﬁnd an MIS. To solve this issue, we decompose the cycle graph G into
paths with unrepetitive patterns and paths with repetitive patterns, in O(1) rounds. For paths
with unrepetitive patterns, we are able to compute a suﬃciently well-spaced MIS in O(1) rounds
by making use of the irregularity of the input patterns. Paths with repetitive patterns are similar
to the paths without input labels, and we will show that we can always label them by repetitive
output patterns, given that the underlying LCL problem is o(log∗n)-time solvable.

4.1
Pumping Lemmas for Paths
Let P = (s, . . . , t) be a directed path, where each node has an input label from Σin. The tripartition
of the nodes ξ(P) = (D1, D2, D3) is deﬁned as follows:
D1 = Nr−1(s) ∪Nr−1(t),
D2 =
 N2r−1(s) ∪N2r−1(t)

\ D1,
D3 = P \ (D1 ∪D2).
See Figure 4 for an illustration. More speciﬁcally, suppose P = (u1, . . . , uk), and let i ∈[1, k]. Then
we have:
• ui ∈D1 if and only if i ∈[1, r] ∪[k −r + 1, k].
• ui ∈D2 if and only if i ∈[r + 1, 2r] ∪[k −2r + 1, k −r].
• ui ∈D3 if and only if i /∈[1, 2r] ∪[k −2r + 1, k].
Let L: D1 ∪D2 →Σout assign output labels to D1 ∪D2. We say that L is extendible w.r.t. P if
there exists a complete labeling L⋄of P such that L⋄agrees with L on D1 ∪D2, and L⋄is locally
consistent at all nodes in D2 ∪D3.
An Equivalence Class.
We deﬁne an equivalence class ⋆∼for the directed paths (i.e., the set of
all non-empty strings in Σ∗
in), as follows.
Consider two directed paths P = (u1, . . . , ux) and P ′ = (v1, . . . , vy), and let ξ(P) = (D1, D2, D3)
and ξ(P ′) = (D′
1, D′
2, D′
3). Consider the following natural 1-to-1 correspondence φ: (D1 ∪D2) →
(D′
1 ∪D′
2) deﬁned as φ(ui) = vi and φ(ux−i+1) = vy−i+1 for each i ∈[1, 2r].
The 1-to-1
correspondence is well-deﬁned so long as (i) x = y or (ii) x ≥4r and y ≥4r. We have P
⋆∼P ′ if
and only if the following two statements are met:
• Isomorphism: The 1-to-1 correspondence φ is well-deﬁned, and for each ui ∈D1 ∪D2,
the input label of ui is identical to the input label of φ(ui).
• Extendibility: Let L be any assignment of output labels to nodes in D1 ∪D2, and let
L′ be the corresponding output labeling of D′
1 ∪D′
2 under φ. Then L is extendible w.r.t.
P if and only if L′ is extendible w.r.t. P ′.
Note that for the special case of x ≤4r, we have P
⋆∼P ′ if and only if P is identical to P ′.
Deﬁne Type(P) as the equivalence class of P w.r.t. ⋆∼. The following technical lemma is analogous
to [6, Lemma 1] in a specialized setting. We only use this lemma to prove the lemmas in Section 4.1.

Lemma 10. Let G be a path graph or a cycle graph where all nodes have input labels from Σin. Let
P be a directed subpath of G, and let P ′ be another directed path such that Type(P ′) = Type(P).
We write ξ(P) = (D1, D2, D3) and ξ(P ′) = (D′
1, D′
2, D′
3). Let L⋄be any complete labeling of G
such that L⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in D2 ∪D3. Let G′ = Replace(G, P, P ′) be the graph
resulting from replacing P with P ′ in G. Then there exists a complete labeling L′
⋄of G′ such that
the following two conditions are met.
1. For each v ∈(V (G) \ V (P))∪(D1∪D2) and its corresponding v′ ∈(V (G′) \ V (P ′))∪(D′
1∪D′
2),
we have L⋄(v) = L′
⋄(v′). Moreover, if v ∈(V (G) \ V (P)) ∪D1 and L⋄is locally consistent at
v, then L′
⋄is locally consistent at v′.
2. L′
⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in D′
2 ∪D′

Proof. The labeling L′

1 ∪D′
2) is chosen “naturally”
as follows.
For each v′ ∈V (G′) \ V (P ′), we set L′
⋄(v′) = L⋄(v) for its corresponding node
v ∈V (G)\V (P). For each v′ ∈D′
1∪D′
2, we set L′
⋄(v′) = L⋄(v) for its corresponding node v ∈D1∪D2
such that φ(v) = v′ in the deﬁnition of ⋆∼. At this point, it is clear that if v ∈(V (G) \ V (P)) ∪D1
has a locally consistent labeling under L⋄, then its corresponding node v′ ∈(V (G′) \ V (P ′)) ∪D′
1
also has a locally consistent labeling under L′
⋄, so Condition 1 holds.
Now, the labeling L′
⋄is only undeﬁned for nodes in D′
3. We show that we can complete the
labeling in such a way that is locally consistent at all nodes in D′
2 ∪D′
3. Denote L as L⋄restricted
to D1 ∪D2. Since L⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in P, the labeling L is extendible w.r.t. P.
Note that if we let L′ be L⋄restricted to D′
1 ∪D′
2, then according to the way we deﬁne L′
⋄, the two
labeling L′ and L are identical under the 1-to-1 correspondence φ speciﬁed in the deﬁnition of ⋆∼.
That is, for each v′ ∈D′
1 ∪D′
2, we have L′(v′) = L(v) for its corresponding node v ∈D1 ∪D2 such
that φ(v) = v′. Since P
⋆∼P ′, the labeling L′ must be extendible w.r.t. P ′. That is, there is a way
to assign L′
⋄(v′) for each v′ ∈D′
3 such that all nodes in D′
2 ∪D′
3 have locally consistent labelings
under L′
⋄, so Condition 2 holds.
One useful consequence of this lemma is that if we start with a path or a cycle G with a legal
labeling, after replacing its subpath P with another one P ′ having the same type as P, then it
is always possible to assign output labeling to P ′ to get a legal labeling without changing the
already-assigned output labels of nodes outside of P ′.
Lemma 11. Let G be a path graph or a cycle graph where all nodes have input labels from Σin. Let
P be a directed subpath of G, and let P ′ be another directed path such that Type(P ′) = Type(P). Let
L⋄be complete labeling of G that is locally consistent at all nodes in P. Let G′ = Replace(G, P, P ′)
be the graph resulting from replacing P with P ′ in G. Then there exists a legal labeling L′
⋄of G′
such that the following two conditions are met.
1. For each v ∈V (G) \ V (P) and its corresponding v′ ∈V (G′) \ V (P ′), we have L⋄(v) = L′
⋄(v′).
Moreover, if L⋄is locally consistent at v ∈V (G) \ V (P), then L′
⋄is locally consistent at v′.
2. L′
⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in P ′.
Proof. We write ξ(P ′) = (D′
1, D′
2, D′
3). Condition 1 in this lemma is implied by Condition 1 in
Lemma 10. To see that Condition 2 in this lemma holds, note that in this lemma we additionally
require that L⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in P. Therefore, Condition 1 of Lemma 10 implies
that L′
⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in D′
1. This observation, together with Condition 2 of
Lemma 10, implies that L′
⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in P ′.

The following lemma is analogous to [6, Theorem 4] in a specialized setting. We only use this
lemma in Section 4.1.
Lemma 12. Let P = (v1, . . . , vk), and let P ′ = (v1, . . . , vk−1). Let the input label of vk be α. Then
Type(P) is a function of α and Type(P ′).
Proof. We prove the following stronger statement. Let G be a directed path, and let H be a
directed subpath of G.
Suppose H′ is another directed path satisfying Type(H) = Type(H′).
Let G′ = Replace(G, H, H′) be the result of replacing H with H′ in G.
Then we claim that
Type(G) = Type(G′). The lemma is a corollary of this claim.
Consider the tripartitions ξ(H) = (B1, B2, B3), ξ(H′) = (B′
1, B′
2, B′
3), ξ(G) = (D1, D2, D3), and
ξ(G′) = (D′
1, D′
2, D′
3). We write B0 = V (G) \ V (H) and B′
0 = V (G′) \ V (H′).
Let φ⋆be the natural 1-to-1 correspondence from B0 ∪B1 ∪B2 to B′
0 ∪B′
1 ∪B′
2. Note that
D1 ∪D2 ⊆B0 ∪B1 ∪B2 and D′
1 ∪D′
2 ⊆B′
0 ∪B′
1 ∪B′
2. Also, the 1-to-1 correspondence between
D1 ∪D2 and D′
1 ∪D′
2 given by φ⋆is exactly the 1-to-1 correspondence φ speciﬁed in the requirement
of G ⋆∼G′.
Let L: (D1 ∪D2) →Σout and let L′ be the corresponding output labeling of D′
1 ∪D′
2, under
the 1-to-1 correspondence φ. To show that G ⋆∼G′, all we need to do is show that L is extendible
w.r.t. G if and only if L′ is extendible w.r.t. G′. Since we can also write G = Replace(G′, H′, H), it
suﬃces to show just one direction, i.e., if L is extendible then L′ is extendible.
Suppose L is extendible. Then there exists an output labeling L⋄of G such that (i) for each
v ∈D1 ∪D2, we have L⋄(v) = L(v), and (ii) L⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in D2 ∪D3. Since
D2 ∪D3 ⊇B2 ∪B3, we can apply Lemma 10, which shows that there exists a complete labeling
L′
⋄of G′ such that the two conditions in Lemma 10 are met. We argue that this implies that L′ is
extendible. We verify that (i) L′(v′) = L′
⋄(v′) for each v′ ∈D′
1 ∪D′
2, and (ii) L′
⋄is locally consistent
at all nodes in D′
2 ∪D′
3.
• Condition 1 of Lemma 10 guarantees that L⋄(v) = L′
⋄(φ⋆(v)) for each v ∈(V (G) \ V (H)) ∪
(B1 ∪B2) = B0 ∪B1 ∪B2 and its corresponding node φ⋆(v) ∈B′
0 ∪B′
1 ∪B′
2. Since D′
1 ∪D′
2 ⊆
B′
0 ∪B′
1 ∪B′
2, we have L′(v′) = L′
⋄(v′) for each v′ ∈D′
1 ∪D′
2.
• The fact that L⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in D2 ∪D3, together with Condition 1 in
Lemma 10, guarantees that L′
⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in (D′
2 ∪D′
3) \ B′
3. Condition 2
in Lemma 10 guarantees that L′
⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in B′
2 ∪B′
3. Therefore, L′
⋄is
locally consistent at all nodes in D′
2 ∪D′
3, as required.
The number of types can be upper bounded as follows.
Lemma 13. The number of equivalence classes of ⋆∼(i.e., types) is at most |Σin|4r2|Σout|4r.
Proof. Let P be a directed path, and let ξ(P) = (D1, D2, D3). Then Type(P) is determined by the
following information.
• The input labels in D1 ∪D2. Note that there are at most |Σin|4r possible input labeling of
D1 ∪D2.
• A length-x binary string indicating the extendibility of each possible output labeling of D1∪D2,
where x = |Σout|4r.
Therefore, the number of equivalence classes of ⋆∼is at most |Σin|4r2|Σout|4r.

Deﬁne ℓpump as the total number of types. Observe that Lemma 12 implies that Type(P) can be
computed by a ﬁnite automaton whose number of states is the total number of types, which is a
constant independent of P. Thus, we have the following two pumping lemmas which allow us to
extend the length of a given directed path P while preserving the type of P. The following two
lemmas follow from the standard pumping lemma for regular language.
Lemma 14. Let P ∈Σk
in with k ≥ℓpump.
Then P can be decomposed into three substrings
P = x ◦y ◦z such that (i) |xy| ≤ℓpump, (ii) |y| ≥1, and (iii) for each non-negative integer i,
Type(x ◦yi ◦z) = Type(P).
Lemma 15. For each w ∈Σ>0
in , there exist two positive integers a and b such that a + b ≤ℓpump,
and Type(wai+b) is invariant for each non-negative integer i.
4.2
The ω(log∗n)—o(n) Gap
In this section we show that the ω(log∗n)—o(n) gap is decidable. More speciﬁcally, we show that
an LCL problem P can be solved in O(log∗n) rounds if and only if there exists a feasible function,
which is deﬁned as follows.
Input: A directed path P = w1 ◦S ◦w2, where |w1| ∈[ℓpump, ℓpump + 1], |w2| ∈[ℓpump, ℓpump + 1],
and |S| = 2r. The decomposition P = w1 ◦S ◦w2 is considered part of the input.
Output: A string L ∈Σ2r
out that represents the output labeling of S.
Requirement: Any such function f is said to be feasible if the following requirement is met for
any paths S1, S2 and wa, wb, wc, wd such that |S1| = |S2| = 2r and {|wa|, |wb|, |wc|, |wd|} ⊆
[ℓpump, ℓpump + 1]. Let P = wa ◦S1 ◦wb ◦wc ◦S2 ◦wd, and consider the following assignment
of output labels to S1 ∪S2.
• Either label S1 by f(wa ◦S1 ◦wb) or label SR
1 by f(wR
b ◦SR
1 ◦wR
a ).
• Either label S2 by f(wc ◦S2 ◦wd) or label SR
2 by f(wR
d ◦SR
2 ◦wR
c ).
It is required that given such a partial labeling of P, the middle part wb ◦wc can be assigned
output labels in such a way that the labeling of (i) the last r nodes of S1, (ii) all nodes in
wb ◦wc, and (iii) the ﬁrst r nodes of S2 are locally consistent.
The following lemma is a straightforward consequence of the well-known O(log∗n)-round MIS
algorithm on cycles.
Lemma 16. Let G be a cycle graph of n nodes, and let s ≤k be two constant integers such that
s + k ≤n. Then in O(log∗n) rounds we can compute a decomposition V = A ∪B such that each
connected component of A has size s, and each connected component of B has size within [k, k + 1].
Proof. For any given constant integer 1 ≤L < n, we will show that in O(log∗n) time we can ﬁnd
an independent set I of G such that each connected component induced by V \ I has at least L
nodes and at most 2L nodes. Using this result with L = 2(s −1) + k(s + k + 1), it is straightforward
to obtain the desired decomposition V = A ∪B, as follows.
For each v ∈I, it arbitrarily chooses a size-s path Sv that contains v, and all nodes in Sv are
included to A. Now each connected component S′ induced by the remaining nodes is a path of
size at least L −2(s −1) ≥k(s + k + 1) and at most 2L. We will divide the path S′ into subpaths
R1, R2, . . . , Rt meeting the following conditions: (i) if i is odd, then the size of Ri is k or k + 1;
22

--- Page 24 ---
(ii) if i is even, then the size of Ri is s; (iii) t is odd. Hence we obtain the desired decomposition
V = A ∪B if we include the nodes in R1, R3, . . . to B and include the nodes in R2, R4, . . . to A. We
show that such a decomposition of S′ into subpaths R1, R2, . . . , Rt exists. Denote z as the size of
S′. We write z = α(s + k + 1) + β, where α > 0 and 0 ≤β < s + k + 1 are integers. Note that we
must have α ≥k and β ≤2k.
• For the case β ≥k, there is a decomposition R1, R2, . . . , Rt satisﬁes the following conditions:
(i) if i is odd, then the size of Ri is k + 1 when i < t or β when i = t; (ii) if i is even, then the
size of Ri is s; (iii) t = 2α + 1 is odd.
• For the case β < k, there is a decomposition R1, R2, . . . , Rt satisﬁes the following conditions:
(i) if i is odd, then the size of Ri is k when i ∈{1, 3, 5, . . . , 2(k−β)−1}∪{t} or k+1 otherwise;
(ii) if i is even, then the size of Ri is s; (iii) t = 2α + 1 is odd.
For the rest of the proof, we show that in O(log∗n) time we can ﬁnd the required independent
set I. We prove the lemma by an induction on L. The base case of L = 1 is identical to the MIS
problem. Now consider L > 1. By induction hypothesis, we ﬁnd an independent set I′ in O(log∗n)
time such that each connected component induced by V \ I′ has at least L′ nodes and at most 2L′
nodes, where L′ = ⌊L/2⌋. Let G′ be the graph resulting from contracting all nodes in V \ I′, and
we compute an MIS I′′ on this graph G′, which can be done in O(log∗n) rounds in the original
graph G. Note that each connected component S of V \ I′′ has size at least 2L′ + 1 ≥L and at most
3(2L′) + 2. If the size of S is higher than 2L, then we can add some nodes in S to the independent
set I′′ so that the component size of the remaining nodes in S is within [L, 2L].
Lemma 17. If a feasible function f exists, then there is an O(log∗n)-round deterministic LOCAL
algorithm for P on cycles.
Proof. Given that the number of nodes n is at least some large enough constant, in O(log∗n) rounds
we can compute a decomposition V = A ∪B such that each connected component of A has size 2r,
and each connected component of B has size within [2ℓpump, 2ℓpump + 1]. This can be done using
Lemma 16 with s = 2r and k = 2ℓpump. We further decompose each connected component P of
B into two paths P = P1 ◦P2 in such a way that the size of both P1 and P2 are within the range
[ℓpump, ℓpump + 1]. We write P to denote the set of all these paths.
Let S be a connected component of A, and let w1 and w2 be its two neighboring paths in P so
that (w1 ◦S ◦w2) is a subpath of the underlying graph G. The output labels of S are assigned either
by labeling S with f(w1 ◦S ◦w2) or by labeling SR with f(wR
2 ◦SR ◦wR
1 ). At this moment, all
components of A have been assigned output labels using f. By the feasibility of f, each connected
component of B is able to label itself output labels in such a way that the labeling of all nodes are
locally consistent.
Lemma 18. If there is an o(n)-round deterministic LOCAL algorithm A for P on cycles, then a
feasible function f exists.
Proof. Fix s to be some suﬃciently large number, and ﬁx n = 8(s + ℓpump) + 2(2r). We select s to
be large enough so that the runtime of A is smaller than 0.1s. For any given directed path w with
|w| ∈[ℓpump, ℓpump + 1], we ﬁx w+ as the result of applying the pumping lemma (Lemma 14) on w
so that the following two conditions are met: (i) |w+| ∈[s, s + ℓpump] and (ii) Type(w) = Type(w+).
23

--- Page 25 ---
Constructing a Feasible Function f by Simulating A.
The function f(w1 ◦S ◦w2) is
constructed by simulating a given o(n)-round deterministic LOCAL algorithm for P. The output
labeling given by f(w1 ◦S ◦w2) is exactly the result of simulating A on the path P = w+
1 ◦S ◦w+
2
while assuming the number of nodes of the underlying graph is n. Remember that the round
complexity of A is o(n) on n-node graphs. By setting s to be large enough, the runtime of A can be
made smaller than 0.1s. Thus, the calculation of f(w1 ◦S ◦w2) only depends on the IDs and the
input labels of (i) the last 0.1s nodes in w+
1 , (ii) all nodes in S, and (iii) the ﬁrst 0.1s nodes in w+
2 .
In the calculation of f(w1 ◦S ◦w2), the IDs of the nodes that participate in the simulation of A are
chosen arbitrarily so long as they are distinct.
Feasibility of f.
Now we verify that the function f constructed above is feasible. Consider any
choices of paths S1, S2 and wa, wb, wc, wd such that |S1| = |S2| = 2r and {|wa|, |wb|, |wc|, |wd|} ⊆
[ℓpump, ℓpump + 1]. Deﬁne P = wa ◦S1 ◦wb ◦wc ◦S2 ◦wd, and let G be the cycle graph formed by
connecting the two ends of the path P. To show that f is feasible, we need to consider the following
four ways of assigning output labels to S1 ∪S2.
1. Label S1 by f(wa ◦S1 ◦wb); label S2 by f(wc ◦S2 ◦wd).
2. Label S1 by f(wa ◦S1 ◦wb); label SR
2 by f(wR
d ◦SR
2 ◦wR
c ).
3. Label SR
1 by f(wR
b ◦SR
1 ◦wR
a ); label S2 by f(wc ◦S2 ◦wd).
4. Label SR
1 by f(wR
b ◦SR
1 ◦wR
a ); label SR
2 by f(wR
d ◦SR
2 ◦wR
c ).
For each of the above four partial labelings of P, we need to show that the middle part wb ◦wc
can still be assigned output labels in such a way that the labeling of (i) the last r nodes of S1, (ii)
all nodes in wb ◦wc, and (iii) the ﬁrst r nodes of S2 are locally consistent.
Proof of the First Case.
In what follows, we focus on the ﬁrst case, i.e., the partial labeling is
given by labeling S1 by f(wa ◦S1 ◦wb) and labeling S2 by f(wc ◦S2 ◦wd); the proof for the other
three cases are analogous. In this case, we deﬁne P ′ = w+
a ◦S1 ◦w+
b ◦w+
c ◦S2 ◦w+
d , and let G′ be
the cycle graph formed by connecting the two ends of P ′. Note that the number of nodes in G′ is at
most 8(s + ℓpump) + 2(2r) = n. All we need to do is to ﬁnd an output labeling L of G such that the
following conditions are satisﬁed.
(a) The output labels of S1 is given by f(wa ◦S1 ◦wb).
(b) The output labels of S2 is given by f(wc ◦S2 ◦wd).
(c) The labeling of (i) the last r nodes of S1, (ii) all nodes in wb ◦wc, and (iii) the ﬁrst r nodes of
S2 are locally consistent.
We ﬁrst generate an output labeling L′ of G′ by executing A on G′ under the following ID
assignment. The IDs of (i) the last 0.1s nodes in w+
a , (ii) all nodes in S1, and (iii) the ﬁrst 0.1s
nodes in w+
b are chosen as the ones used in the deﬁnition of f(wa ◦S1 ◦wb). Similarly, the IDs of (i)
the last 0.1s nodes in w+
c , (ii) all nodes in S2, and (iii) the ﬁrst 0.1s nodes in w+
d are chosen as the
ones used in the deﬁnition of f(wc ◦S2 ◦wd). The IDs of the rest of the nodes are chosen arbitrarily
so long as when we run A on G′, no node sees two nodes with the same ID. Due to the way we
deﬁne f, the output labeling L′ of the subpath S1 is exactly given by f(wa ◦S1 ◦wb), and the output
labeling L′ of S2 is exactly f(wc ◦S2 ◦wd). Due to the correctness of A, L′ is a legal labeling.
We transform the output labeling L′ of G′ to a desired output labeling L of G. Remember that
G is the result of replacing the four subpaths w+ of G′ by w, and we have Type(w+) = Type(w). In
view of Lemma 11, there is a legal labeling L of G such that all nodes in S1 and S2 are labeled the
same as in G′. Therefore, the labeling L satisﬁes the above three conditions (a), (b), and (c).
24

--- Page 26 ---
The Other Cases.
We brieﬂy discuss how we modify the proof to deal with the other three
cases. For example, consider the second case, where the partial labeling is given by labeling S1 by
f(wa ◦S1 ◦wb) and labeling SR
2 by f(wR
d ◦SR
2 ◦wR
c ). In this case, the path P ′ is deﬁned as
P ′ = w+
a ◦S1 ◦w+
b ◦
 (wR
c )+R ◦SR
2 ◦
 (wR
d )+R .
During the ID assignment of G′, the IDs of (i) the last 0.1s nodes in w+
c , (ii) all nodes in S2, and
(iii) the ﬁrst 0.1s nodes in w+
d are now chosen as the ones used in the deﬁnition of f(wR
d ◦SR
2 ◦wR
c ).
Using such an ID assignment, the output labeling L′ of SR
2 as the result of executing A on G′ will
be exactly the same as the output labeling given by f(wR
d ◦SR
2 ◦wR
c ). The rest of the proof is the
same.
Theorem 8 follows from the above two lemmas. The decidability result is due to the simple
observation that whether a feasible function exists is decidable.
4.3
Partitioning a Cycle
In the following sections, we prove the decidability result associated with the ω(1)—o(log∗n) gap.
In this proof, we also deﬁne a feasible function, prove its decidability, and show the existence given
an o(log∗n)-time algorithm. The main challenge here is that an MIS cannot be computed in O(1)
time. To solve this issue, we decompose a cycle into paths with unrepetitive patterns and paths
with repetitive patterns. For paths with unrepetitive patterns, we are able to compute a suﬃciently
well-spaced MIS in O(1) time by making use of the irregularity of the input patterns.
Section 4.3 considers an O(1)-round algorithm that partitions a cycle into some short paths
and some paths that have a repeated input pattern. Section 4.4 deﬁnes a feasible function whose
existence characterizes the O(1)-round solvable LCL problems. In Section 4.5, we prove Theorem 9.
Partitioning an Undirected Cycle into Directed Paths.
Let G be a cycle graph.
An
orientation of a node v is an assignment to one of its neighbor, this can be speciﬁed using port-
numbering. An orientation of the nodes in G is called ℓ-orientation if the following condition is met.
If |V (G)| ≤ℓ, then all nodes in G are oriented to the same direction. If |V (G)| > ℓ, then each node
v ∈V (G) belongs to a path P such that (i) all nodes in P are oriented to the same direction, and
(ii) the number of nodes in P is at least ℓ. In O(1) rounds we can compute an ℓ-orientation of G for
any constant ℓ.
Lemma 19 ([6]). Let G be a cycle graph. Let ℓbe a constant. There is a deterministic LOCAL
algorithm that computes an ℓ-orientation of G in O(1) rounds.
In this section, we will use a generalization of an ℓ-orientation that satisﬁes an additional
requirement that the input labels of each directed path P in the decomposition with |V (P)| > 2ℓwidth
(where 2ℓwidth is a threshold) must form a periodic string (whose period length is at most ℓpattern).
A string w ∈Σ∗
in is called primitive if w cannot be written as xi for some x ∈Σ∗
in and i ≥2. Let
G be a cycle graph or a path graph where each node v ∈V (G) has an input label from Σin. We
deﬁne an (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition as a partition of G into a set of connected subgraphs P
meeting the following criteria. We assume |V (G)| > 2ℓwidth and ℓpattern ≥ℓwidth.
Direction and Minimum Length: For each P ∈P, the nodes in P are oriented to the same
direction, and |V (P)| ≥ℓwidth.
25

--- Page 27 ---
Short Paths: Deﬁne Pshort as the subset of P that contains paths having at most 2ℓwidth
nodes. For each directed path P = (v1, . . . , vk) ∈Pshort, each node vi in P knows its rank i.
Long Paths: Deﬁne Plong = P \ Pshort. Then the input labeling of the nodes in P is of the
form wk for some primitive string w ∈Σ∗
in such that |w| ≤ℓpattern and k ≥ℓcount. Moreover,
each node v in P knows the string w.
Note that P may contain a cycle. This is possible only when G is a cycle where the input
labeling is a repetition (at least ℓcount times) of a primitive string w ∈Σ∗
in of length at most ℓpattern.
In this case, we must have P = Plong = {G}. Otherwise, P contains only paths.
The goal of this section is to show that an (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition can be found in O(1)
rounds. First of all, in Lemma 20 we demonstrate how we can break symmetry in O(1) rounds
given that the underlying graph is directed and the input labels does not form long periodic strings.
Let G be a path or a cycle. A set I ⊆V (G) is called an (α, β)-independent set if the following
conditions are met: (i) I is an independent set, and I does not contain either endpoint of G (if G is
a path), and (ii) each connected component induced by V \ I has at least α nodes and at most β
nodes, unless |V | ≤α, in which case we allow I = ∅. Note that ﬁnding an (α, β)-independent set
takes O(log∗n) rounds in general, but in Lemma 20 we show that by leveraging the “irregularity”
of input labels, we can do this in O(1) rounds on directed paths or cycles without periodic patterns.
Lemma 20. Let γ and ℓbe any two constants with ℓ≥γ. Let G be a directed cycle or a directed
path that does not contain any subpath of the form wx, with |w| ≤γ and |wx| ≥ℓ. There is a
deterministic LOCAL algorithm that computes an (γ, 2γ)-independent set I of G in O(1) rounds.
Proof. For the case G is a directed path P = (s, . . . , t), deﬁne V ′ as the set of nodes in G whose
distance to t is at least ℓ−1. For the case G is a directed cycle, deﬁne V ′ = V (G). In what follows,
we focus on ﬁnding an (γ, 2γ)-independent set I′ of the nodes in V ′. Extending the set I′ to produce
the desired independent set I can be done with extra O(1) rounds.
Recall that G is directed. Deﬁne the color of a node v ∈V ′ by the sequence of the ℓinput labels
of v and the ℓ−1 nodes following v in G. For each node v ∈V ′, there is no other node within
distance γ to v having the same color as v, since otherwise we can ﬁnd a subpath whose input labels
form a string wx, with |w| ≤γ and |wx| ≥ℓ. By applying the standard procedure that computes an
MIS from a coloring, within O(1) rounds a (γ, 2γ)-independent set I′ can be obtained.
Using Lemma 20, we ﬁrst show that an (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition can be found in O(1)
rounds for the case G is directed. That is, all nodes in G are initially oriented to the same direction,
and we are allowed to re-orient the nodes.
Lemma 21. Let G be a directed cycle or a directed path where each node v ∈V (G) has an input label
from Σin, and |V (G)| > 2ℓwidth. Let ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern be three constants such that ℓpattern ≥ℓwidth.
There is a deterministic LOCAL algorithm that computes an (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition in O(1)
rounds
Proof. Let (w1, w2, . . . , wk) be any ordering of the primitive strings in Σ∗
in of length at most ℓpattern.
First, construct a set of subgraphs Plong as follows. Initialize U = V (G) and Plong = ∅. For i = 1 to
k, execute the following procedure. Let Si be the set of maximal-size connected subgraphs formed by
nodes in U such that the input labels form the string wx
i with x ≥ℓcount + 2ℓwidth. Each node v ∈U
in O(1) rounds checks if v belongs to a subgraph in Si; if so, remove v from U. For each P ∈Si,
26

--- Page 28 ---
deﬁne P ′ as follows. If P is a cycle, then P ′ = P. If P is a path, then P ′ is the result of removing
all nodes that are within distance ℓwidth|wi| −1 to an endpoint in P. Note that each node v in P
knows whether v belongs to P ′. Deﬁne S′
i = {P ′|P ∈Si}, and then update Plong ←Plong ∪S′
i.
It is straightforward to verify that each path or cycle P ∈Plong satisﬁes the requirement in the
deﬁnition of (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition. Deﬁne the set of subgraphs Pirreg as the connected
components of the nodes not in any subgraph in Plong. Deﬁne ℓ= (ℓpattern + 2ℓwidth) · ℓcount. By
our construction, the input labeling in each subgraph P ∈Pirreg does not contain any substring
wx, with 1 ≤|w| ≤ℓpattern and |wx| ≥ℓ. An (ℓpattern, 2ℓpattern)-independent set of each P ∈Pirreg
can be computed using Lemma 20 in O(1) rounds. Observe that each subgraph P ∈Pirreg has at
least ℓwidth nodes. Given an (ℓpattern, 2ℓpattern)-independent set of a subgraph P ∈Pirreg, in O(1)
rounds P can be partitioned into subpaths, each of which contains at least ℓpattern nodes and at
most 2ℓpattern nodes. This ﬁnishes the construction of an (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition.
Combining Lemma 21 and Lemma 19, we are able to construct an (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition
in O(1) rounds for undirected graphs.
Lemma 22. Let G be a cycle or a path where each node v ∈V (G) has an input label from Σin, and
|V (G)| > 2ℓwidth. Let ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern be three constants such that ℓpattern ≥ℓwidth. There is a
deterministic LOCAL algorithm that computes an (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition in O(1) rounds
Proof. The algorithm is as follows. Compute an ℓ-orientation of G by Lemma 19 in O(1) rounds
with ℓ= 2ℓwidth + 1. For each maximal-length connected subgraph P where each constituent node
is oriented to the same direction, ﬁnd an (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition of P in O(1) rounds by
Lemma 21.

Feasible Function
The goal of this section is to deﬁne a feasible function whose existence characterizes the O(1)-round
solvable LCL problems. With respect to an LCL problem P and a function f which takes a string
w ∈Σk
in with 1 ≤k ≤ℓpump as input, and returns a string f(w) ∈Σk
out, we deﬁne some partially or
completely labeled path graphs which are used in the deﬁnition of a feasible function.
Completely Labeled Graph Gw,z: Let w ∈Σ∗
in be any string of length at least 1 and at most
ℓpump. Let z be any non-negative integer. Deﬁne Gw,z = (Gw,z, L) as follows. The graph Gw,z
is a path of the form wr ◦wz ◦wr. The labeling L is a complete labeling of the form f(w)z+2r.
Deﬁne Mid(Gw,z) as the middle subpath wz of Gw,z.
Partially Labeled Graph Gw1,w2,S: Let w1, w2 ∈Σ∗
in be any two strings of length at least 1 and
at most ℓpump. Let S ∈Σ∗
in be any string (can be empty). Deﬁne Gw1,w2,S = (Gw1,w2,S, L) as
follows. The graph Gw1,w2,S is the path of the form wℓpump+2r
1
◦S ◦wℓpump+2r
2
. The labeling
L is a partial labeling of Gw1,w2,S which ﬁxes the output labels of the ﬁrst 2r|w1| and the
last 2r|w2| nodes by f(w1)2r and f(w2)2r, respectively. Deﬁne Mid(Gw1,w2,S) as the middle
subpath wℓpump+r
1
◦S ◦wℓpump+r
2
of Gw1,w2,S.
Feasible Function: We call f a feasible function if the following conditions are met: (i) For each
Gw,z = (Gw,z, L), the complete labeling L is locally consistent at all nodes in Mid(Gw,z). (ii)
Each partially labeled graph Gw1,w2,S admits a complete labeling L⋄that is locally consistent
at all nodes in Mid(Gw1,w2,S).
Lemma 23. Given an LCL problem P on cycle graphs. It is decidable whether there is a feasible
function.
27

--- Page 29 ---
Proof. Note that it is not immediate from its deﬁnition as to whether a feasible function exists is
decidable, since there appears to be inﬁnitely many graphs Gw,z and Gw1,w2,S needed to be examined.
However, the following simple observations show that it suﬃces to check only a constant number of
these graphs.
• If the complete labeling L of Gw,1 = (Gw,1, L) is locally consistent at all nodes in Mid(Gw,1),
then for all z ≥1, the complete labeling L of Gw,z = (Gw,z, L) is also locally consistent at all
nodes in Mid(Gw,z).
• If Gw1,w2,S admits a complete labeling L⋄that is locally consistent at all nodes in Mid(Gw1,w2,S),
then for each S′ such that Type(S) = Type(S′), the partially labeled graph Gw1,w2,S′ also
admits a complete labeling L⋄that is locally consistent at all nodes in Mid(Gw1,w2,S′). This is
due to Lemma 11.
Therefore, to decide whether a function f is feasible, we only need to check all possible Gw,z and
Gw1,w2,S. For each w we only need to consider the graph Gw,z with z = 1. For each w1 and w2, we
do not need to go over all S; we only need to consider (i) the empty string S = ∅, and (ii) for each
type τ, a string S ∈Σ∗
in such that Type(S) = τ. By Lemma 14, for each type τ, there exists P ∈Σx
in
with x ≤ℓpump such that Type(P) = τ. Therefore, a string S with Type(S) = τ can be found in
bounded amount of time; also note that the number of types is bounded; see Lemma 13.
For the rest of this section, we show that as long as the deterministic LOCAL complexity of
P is o(log∗n) on cycle graphs, there exists a feasible function f. In Lemma 24 we show how to
extract a function f from a given o(log∗n)-round deterministic LOCAL algorithm A, and then in
Lemma 25 we prove that such a function f is feasible. Intuitively, Lemma 24 shows that there exists
an ID-assignment such that when we run A on a subpath whose input labeling is a repetition of a
length-k pattern w, the output labeling is also a repetition of a length-k pattern w′. The function f
will be deﬁned as f(w) = w′.
Lemma 24. Let A be any deterministic LOCAL algorithm that solves P in t(n) = o(log∗n) rounds.
Then there is a number n′ and function f which takes a string w ∈Σk
in with 1 ≤k ≤ℓpump as input,
and returns a string f(w) ∈Σk
out meeting the following condition. For any P = wi ◦w2r+1 ◦wi such
that |wi| ≥t(n′) and 1 ≤|w| ≤ℓpump, there is an assignment of distinct Θ(log n′)-bit IDs to the
nodes in P such that the following is true. Simulating A on P while assuming that the total number
of nodes in the underlying graph is n′ yields the output labeling f(w)2r+1 for the middle subpath
w2r+1.
Proof. In this proof we assume that there is no such a number n′. Then we claim that using A it is
possible to obtain a deterministic LOCAL algorithm for MIS on an n-node directed cycle G without
input labeling, in O(t(n)) + O(1) = o(log∗n) rounds. This contradicts the well-known Ω(log∗n)
lower bound for MIS [20].
Let G be an n-node directed cycle without input labeling. The MIS algorithm on G is described
as follows. Let w ∈Σk
in with 1 ≤k ≤ℓpump be chosen such that for any function f, the string
f(w) ∈Σk
out does not satisfy the conditions stated in the lemma for the number n′ = nk. Deﬁne
G′ as the graph resulting from replacing each node v ∈V (G) with a path w. We can simulate the
imaginary graph G′ in the communication network G by letting each node v ∈V (G) simulate a
path w.
We execute the algorithm A on G′ while assuming that the total number of nodes is n′. The
execution takes t(n′) = O(t(n)) rounds. For each node v ∈V (G), deﬁne the color of v as the
sequence of the output labels of the path w2r simulated by the node v and the 2r −1 nodes following
28

--- Page 30 ---
v in the directed cycle G. This gives us a proper O(1)-coloring, since otherwise there must exist
a subpath P = w2r+1 of G′ such that the output labeling of P is of the form y2r+1 for some y,
contradicting our choice of w. Using the standard procedure of computing an MIS from a coloring,
with extra O(1) rounds, an MIS of G can be obtained.
Note that there is a subtle issue about how we set the IDs of nodes in V (G′). The following
method is guaranteed to output distinct IDs. Let v ∈V (G), and let u1, . . . , uk be the nodes in
V (G′) simulated by v. Then we may use ID(ui) = k · ID(v) + i.
Lemma 25. Suppose that the deterministic LOCAL complexity of P is o(log∗n) on cycle graphs.
Then there exists a feasible function f.
Proof. Let A be any deterministic LOCAL algorithm that solves P in t(n) = o(log∗n) rounds. Let
n′ and f be chosen to meet the conditions in Lemma 24 for A. The goal of the proof is to show
that f is a feasible function. According to the conditions speciﬁed in Lemma 24 for the function f,
we already know that the complete labeling L of each Gw,z = (Gw,z, L) is locally consistent at all
nodes in Mid(Gw,z). Therefore, all we need to do is the following. For each partially labeled graph
Gw1,w2,S, ﬁnd a complete labeling L⋄that is locally consistent at all nodes in Mid(Gw1,w2,S).
Given the three parameters w1, w2, and S, deﬁne G as the cycle resulting from linking the
two ends of the path wℓpump
1
◦w2r+1
1
◦wℓpump
1
◦S ◦wℓpump
2
◦w2r+1
2
◦wℓpump
2
. Deﬁne L as the partial
labeling of G which ﬁxes the output labeling of the two subpaths w2r+1
1
and w2r+1
2
by f(w1)2r+1
and f(w2)2r+1, respectively. We write P mid
1
and P mid
2
to denote the two subpaths w2r+1
1
and w2r+1
2
,
respectively.
In what follows, we show that the partially labeled graph G = (G, L) admits a legal labeling L⋄.
Since Gw1,w2,S is a subgraph of G = (G, L), such a legal labeling L⋄is also a complete labeling of
Gw1,w2,S that is locally consistent at all nodes in Mid(Gw1,w2,S).
For the rest of the proof, we show the existence of L⋄. This will be established by applying a
pumping lemma. Deﬁne the graph G′ as the result of the following operations on G.
• Replace the two subpaths wℓpump
1
by wx
1, where the number x is chosen such that x|w1| ≥
2t(n′) + r, and Type(wℓpump
1
) = Type(wx
1).
• Replace the two subpaths wℓpump
2
by wy
2, where the number y is chosen such that y|w2| ≥
2t(n′) + r, and Type(wℓpump
2
) = Type(wy
2).
The existence of the numbers x and y above is guaranteed by Lemma 15. The IDs of nodes in G′ are
assigned as follows. For i = 1, 2, select the IDs of the nodes in S
v∈P mid
i
Nt(n′)(v) in such a way that
the output labeling of P mid
i
resulting from executing A on G′ while assuming that the total number
of nodes is n′ is f(wi)2r+1. The existence of such an ID assignment is guaranteed by Lemma 24. For
all remaining nodes in G′, select their IDs in such a way that all nodes in Nr+t(n′)(v) receive distinct
IDs, for each v ∈V (G′). This ensures that the outcome of executing A on G′ while assuming that
the total number of nodes is n′ is a legal labeling.
Let L′
⋄be the legal labeling of G′ resulting from executing A with the above IDs while pretending
that the total number of nodes is n′. Note that L′
⋄must label P mid
1
and P mid
2
by f(w1)2r+1 and
f(w2)2r+1, respectively. A desired legal labeling L⋄of G can be obtained from the legal labeling L′
⋄of
G′ by applying Lemma 11, as we have Type(wℓpump
1
) = Type(wx
1) and Type(wℓpump
2
) = Type(wy
2).
4.5
The ω(1)—o(log∗n) Gap
In this section we prove that it is decidable whether a given LCL problem P has complexity Ω(log∗n)
or O(1) on cycle graphs.
29

--- Page 31 ---
Lemma 26. Let f be any feasible function. Let G be any cycle graph. Let P be any set of
disjoint subgraphs in G such that the input labeling of each P ∈P is of the form wx such that
x ≥2ℓpump + 2r, and w ∈Σk
in is a string with 1 ≤k ≤ℓpump. For each P ∈P, deﬁne the subgraph
P ′ as follows. If P is a cycle, deﬁne P ′ = P. If P is a path, write P = wℓpump ◦wi ◦wℓpump, and
deﬁne P ′ as the middle subpath wi. Let L be a partial labeling of G deﬁned as follows. For each
P = wx ∈P, ﬁx the output labels of each subpath w of P ′ by f(w). Then G = (G, L) admits a legal
labeling L⋄.
Proof. Deﬁne V1 as the set of all nodes such that v ∈V1 if v belongs to the middle subpath wj
of some path P = wℓpump ◦wr ◦wj ◦wr ◦wℓpump ∈P. By the deﬁnition of feasible function, L is
already locally consistent at all nodes in V1. Thus, all we need to do is to construct a complete
labeling L⋄of G = (G, L), and argue that L⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in V2 = V (G) \ V1.
There are two easy special cases. If P = ∅, then no output label of any node in G is ﬁxed, and
so G trivially admits a legal labeling. If P contains a cycle, then P = {G}, and hence L is already
a legal labeling as V1 = V (G).
In subsequent discussion, we restrict ourselves to the case that P is non-empty and contains only
paths. The output labeling L⋄is constructed as follows. Deﬁne Punlabeled as the maximal-length
subpaths of G that are not assigned any output labels by L. A path P ∈Punlabeled must be of the
form wℓpump
1
◦S ◦wℓpump
2
, where w1, w2 ∈Σ∗
in are two strings of length at least 1 and at most ℓpump,
and S ∈Σ∗
in can be any string (including the empty string). Given P ∈Punlabeled, we make the
following deﬁnitions.
• Deﬁne P + as the subpath of G that includes P and the r|w1| nodes preceding P, and the
r|w2| nodes following P in the graph G. Note that the set V2 is exactly the union of nodes in
P + for all P ∈Punlabeled.
• Deﬁne P ++ as the subpath of G that includes P and the 2r|w1| nodes preceding P, and the
2r|w2| nodes following P in the graph G. The path P ++ must be of the form wℓpump+2r
1
◦S ◦
wℓpump+2r
2
, and the labeling L already ﬁxes the output labels of the ﬁrst 2r|w1| and the last
2r|w2| nodes of P ++ by f(w1)2r and f(w2)2r, respectively.
Observe that the path P ++ = wℓpump+2r
1
◦S ◦wℓpump+2r
2
together with the labeling L is exactly the
partially labeled graph Gw1,w2,S. We assign the output labels to the nodes in P by the labeling
L⋄guaranteed in the deﬁnition of feasible function. It is ensured that the labeling of all nodes
within P + are locally consistent. By doing so for each P ∈Punlabeled, we obtain a desired complete
labeling that is locally consistent at all nodes in V2.
Lemma 27. Suppose that there is a feasible function f for the LCL problem P. Then there is an
O(1)-round deterministic LOCAL algorithm A on cycle graphs.
Proof. The ﬁrst step of the algorithm A is to compute an (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition in O(1)
rounds by Lemma 22. We set ℓcount = 2ℓpump + 2r and ℓwidth = ℓpattern = ℓpump. We assume
|V (G)| > 2ℓwidth. Recall that an (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition decomposes the cycle G into two
sets of disjoint subgraphs Pshort and Plong.
Deﬁne G′ as the graph resulting from applying the following operations on G.
For each
P ∈Pshort, replace the path P by the path P ∗= x ◦yi ◦z such that i = ℓcount, 1 ≤|y| ≤ℓpattern,
and the type of P ∗is the same as the type of P. The path P ∗is obtained via Lemma 14. Note that
each path P ∈Pshort has at least ℓwidth = ℓpump nodes and at most 2ℓwidth = 2ℓpump nodes. Deﬁne
P∗as the set of all P ∗such that P ∈Pshort. The graph G′ is simulated in the communication
graph G by electing a leader for each path P ∈Pshort to simulate P ∗.

Calculate a partial labeling L′ of G′ using the feasible function f as follows. Recall ℓcount =
2ℓpump + 2r. For each P ∗= x ◦yℓpump ◦y2r ◦yℓpump ◦z ∈P∗, label the middle subpath y2r by the
function f. For each P = wℓpump ◦wi ◦wℓpump ∈Plong, label the middle subpath wi by f(w)i. Even
though a path P ∈Plong can have ω(1) nodes, this step can be done locally in O(1) rounds due to
the following property of (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition. All nodes in a path P ∈Plong agree with
the same direction and know the primitive string w.
By Lemma 26, the remaining unlabeled nodes in G′ can be labeled to yield a legal labeling of
G′. This can be done in O(1) rounds since the connected components formed by unlabeled nodes
have at most O(1) nodes. Given any valid labeling of G′, a legal labeling of G can be obtained by
applying Lemma 11 in O(1) rounds. Remember that Type(P) = Type(P ∗) for each P ∈Pshort, and
G′ is exactly the result of replacing each P ∈Pshort by P ∗.
See Figure 5 for an illustration of Lemma 27: (1) applying a pumping lemma to extend each
path P ∈Pshort; (2) labeling the middle subpath y2r of P ∗= x ◦yℓpump ◦y2r ◦yℓpump ◦z ∈P∗and
the middle subpath wj of P ′ = wℓpump ◦wi ◦wℓpump ∈Plong by the function f; (3) the remaining
unlabeled nodes in G′ can be labeled to yield a legal labeling of G′ by Lemma 26; (4) since
Type(P) = Type(P ∗) for each P ∈Pshort, we can recover a legal labeling of G by re-labeling nodes
in each P ∈Pshort.
Combining Lemma 23, Lemma 25, and Lemma 27, we have proved Theorem 9. That is, for any
LCL problem P on cycle graphs, its deterministic LOCAL complexity is either Ω(log∗n) or O(1).
Moreover, there is an algorithm that decides whether P has complexity Ω(log∗n) or O(1) on cycle
graphs; for the case the complexity is O(1), the algorithm outputs a description of an O(1)-round
deterministic LOCAL algorithm that solves P.

Deciding Feasible-Function Existence for
β-Normalized, Radius-1 LCLs on Directed Paths is
in NEXPTIME
Abstract
We give a nondeterministic 2poly(β)-time algorithm that decides,
for a β-normalized, radius-1 LCL on globally oriented paths, whether
there exists a feasible function. This decides both gaps O(log∗n) vs.
Θ(n) (mid-consistency) and O(1) vs. Ω(log∗n) (bridging). Our proof
is self-contained modulo standard pumping/replacement facts for path
types; we restate the exact type bound, give a finite-checks lemma with
an explicit z-bound Z ≤ℓ2
pump, spell out the DP used by the verifier
(with boundary handling and tight O(kβ2) complexity), and prove
soundness/completeness. We use Section 4 and Lemmas 10–15, 11, 12,
as well as Theorems 8–9 from the reference.1
1
Model and Normalization (r=1)
We work on globally oriented paths. A β-normalized LCL is given by
Σin = {0, 1},
|Σout| = β,
Cin–out ⊆Σin × Σout,
Cout–out ⊆Σout × Σout,
and a labeling is legal iff (in(v), out(v)) ∈Cin–out for each node v and
(out(u), out(v)) ∈Cout–out for each directed edge u →v. The input size is
N = poly(β).
Types and pumping for r = 1.
For a path P = (u1, . . . , uk) with k ≥4,
define B1 = {u1, uk} and B2 = {u2, uk−1}. Two paths are type-equivalent if
1All background references (lemmas, constructions, and the two gap theorems) refer to
the uploaded PDF: The distributed complexity of locally checkable problems on paths is
decidable. See Section 4 (pp. 19–32), especially Lemmas 10–15 (types/pumping), Lemma 11
(replacement), Lemma 12 (type composition), and Theorems 8–9 (gap characterizations).

(i) inputs on B1 ∪B2 match and (ii) the same boundary-output assignments
on B1 ∪B2 are extendible. Let Type(P) be the type. Counting: there are
24 choices for boundary inputs and a yes/no choice for each of β4 boundary-
output 4-tuples, so
M := |{Type(P)}| ≤24 · 2β4 = 2β4+4 = 2Θ(β4).
Set ℓpump := M. The DFA view of types and pumping/replacement lemmas
are in Section 4: Lemma 12 (type composition), Lemmas 10–11 (replacement),
and Lemmas 14–15 (pumping/periodicity).2

Contexts and Feasible Functions (no circularity)
Fix ℓpump. A context is any triple (w1, S, w2) with |w1|, |w2| ∈{ℓpump, ℓpump+1}
and S ∈Σ2
in. We identify contexts by the type of the concatenation w1Sw2.
Thus the set C of context types is a subset of the global type space, indepen-
dent of f.
Definition 1 (Feasible function). A map f : C →Σ2
out is feasible if:
• (F1) Mid-consistency. For any contexts waS1wb and wcS2wd, the
fixed outputs f(Type(waS1wb)) on S1 and f(Type(wcS2wd)) on S2
extend to a legal labeling of waS1 wbwc S2wd.
• (F2) Bridging. For any context (w1, S, w2) and all z ≥1, the fixed
outputs f(Type(w1Sw2)) on S extend to a legal labeling of wz
1Swz
2.
These are precisely the certificates that characterize the two gaps on cy-
cles/paths: (F1) ⇔O(log∗n) vs. Θ(n), and (F1)+(F2) ⇔O(1) vs. Ω(log∗n).3

Finite Checks for Bridging:

bound
We now reduce the universal quantifier in (F2) to finitely many z.

in there exist integers

a, b > 0 with a + b ≤ℓpump such that Type(wat+b) is independent of t ≥0.4
Why: consider the finite set of types T , |T | = ℓpump, and the self-map
Fw : T →T that composes by w. The sequence Ti := F i
w(T0) (here T0 is the
type of the empty prefix) has a repetition Tp = Tq with 1 ≤p < q ≤ℓpump;
setting a = q −p, b = p gives a + b = q ≤ℓpump and Tat+b constant for all
t ≥0. This is the standard orbit argument behind Lemma 15.
Lemma 1 (Finite z for bridging). Fix a context (w1, S, w2). There exist
parameters (ai, bi) for wi with ai+bi ≤ℓpump such that Type(wait+bi
i
) is t-
invariant. Hence the pair
 Type(wz
1), Type(wz
2)

takes at most a1a2 ≤ℓ2
pump
distinct values, and by type composition (Lemma 12) Type(wz
1Swz
2) also takes
at most ℓ2
pump values. Consequently, there exists Z ≤ℓ2
pump with
∀z ≥1 ∃z′ ∈{1, . . . , Z} : Type(wz
1Swz
2) = Type(wz′
1 Swz′
2 ).
Thus (F2) holds iff the partial outputs on S extend for all z ∈{1, . . . , Z}.
Proof. Apply Lemma 15 to each wi (periodicity), and use Lemma 12 (type
composition) to conclude that the type of wz
1Swz
2 is determined by the pair
of side types, whence the bound by pigeonhole. Extendibility depends only
on the resulting type and the fixed outputs on S (by the replacement lemma,
Lemma 11), so a single representative per type suffice.5
How we pick Z in practice.
We will use the worst-case bound Z = ℓ2
pump;
this keeps the algorithm simple and does not affect the asymptotic bound.
(Optional refinement: for a fixed context, compute the cycle structure of
Fw1 and Fw2 in the type DFA and set Z to the lcm of periods times the
max preperiod—still ≤ℓ2
pump—which can reduce constants while remaining
2poly(β) overall.)

Deterministic DP for extendibility (with precise
complexity)

Layered automaton.
Given a path P = (v1, . . . , vk) and a set F of forced
positions with outputs oi ∈Σout, build k layers, one per position. Layer i
keeps the set
Li := {x ∈Σout : ( in(vi), x ) ∈Cin–out and if i ∈F, x = oi}.
Insert a directed edge x →y from layer i to i+1 iff (x, y) ∈Cout–out. There
is a legal completion iff the layered graph has a path from some state in layer
1 to some state in layer k.
Running time and memory.
Let k = |P|. Constructing layers and edges
takes O(k · |Cout–out|) time, which is O(kβ2) in the worst case, and O(kβ)
memory. Forced nodes reduce the number of states (they do not increase
complexity): the check is a standard reachability on this DAG, also in O(kβ2)
time.

Nondeterministic algorithm and correctness
Precomputation (deterministic, 2poly(β))
1. Enumerate all types T by exploring the boundary-extendibility DFA
(Lemma 12), set ℓpump = |T | ≤2Θ(β4).6
2. For each type t ∈T and each boundary assignment on B1 ∪B2, pre-
compute extendible? via DP on a fixed representative of type t (length
O(ℓpump)).
3. Compute the set C ⊆T of context types: those realized by some w1Sw2
with |wi| ∈{ℓpump, ℓpump+1} and |S| = 2. Note |C| ≤ℓpump.
Guess
Nondeterministically guess f(τ) ∈Σ2
out for every τ ∈C.
Verify (deterministic, 2poly(β))
(V1) Mid-consistency. For each ordered pair of contexts (waS1wb, wcS2wd), run the DP on
waS1 wbwc S2wd with the two 2-node windows S1, S2 forced to f; accept
only if the DP succeeds. Why no extra buffers: by definition of contexts,

wb, wc each has length ℓpump or ℓpump+1, so the underlined bridge wbwc
is already a long buffer for the replacement lemmas.
(V2) Bridging. For each context (w1, S, w2) and each z = 1, . . . , Z with Z = ℓ2
pump from
Lemma 1, run the DP on wz
1Swz
2 with the two nodes of S forced to f.
(All seams internal to wz
1 and wz
2 are covered by this DP; no separate
”seam test” is needed.)
Theorem 1 (Soundness and completeness). If the verifier accepts some
guessed f, then f satisfies (F1) and (F2); conversely, if a feasible f exists,
some guess passes (V1)–(V2).
Proof sketch. (V1) is exactly (F1). For (F2), Lemma 1 shows it suffices to
check z ≤Z; (V2) performs those checks with a DP that validates all local
constraints, including seams created by repetition. Conversely, a feasible f
passes (V1) and by Lemma 1 also passes (V2) for all z ≤Z, hence for all
z.
Complexity and main theorem
Precomputation explores T and runs DPs on O(ℓpump)-length words, all in
2poly(β) time. Verification runs a polynomial number of DPs on strings of
length O(ℓ3
pump) (worst case, from z ≤ℓ2
pump and context width O(ℓpump)),
each in O(kβ2); altogether 2poly(β) = 2poly(N) time.
Theorem 2 (Main). Feasible-Function Existence for β-normalized,
radius-1 LCLs on directed paths is in NEXPTIME.

Connection to the two gaps
We use the standard implications:
• (F1) ⇒O(log∗n) and failure of (F1) ⇒Θ(n) (Theorem 8, with MIS-
based decomposition, Lemma 16).7
• (F1)+(F2) ⇒O(1) and failure of (F2) ⇒Ω(log∗n) (partition Lem-

Notes
Non-circularity.
Context types are defined as a subset of global types
(those realized by w1Sw2 with |wi| ∈{ℓpump, ℓpump+1}), independently of f.
General r > 1 (remark).
All arguments lift to any fixed radius r: the
type space size becomes 2poly(βO(r)) (cf. Lemma 13), the DP has βO(r) states
per layer, and Lemma 1 still yields a finite Z from the same periodicity
argument.10
A
Optional algebraic view (boolean matrices with
the seam)
Let A ∈{0, 1}β×β be the adjacency of Cout–out: A[x, y] = 1 ⇐⇒(x, y) ∈
Cout–out. For a word w, define Cw ∈{0, 1}β×β by (Cw)ij = 1 iff there is a legal
labeling of w whose first/last outputs are i/j and nodewise (in(·), out(·)) ∈
Cin–out. Then boolean multiplication gives the exact composition law
Cxy = Cx A Cy,
hence
Cwz = Cw (ACw)z−1.
Proof: (i, k) ∈Cxy iff there exists j such that (i, j) ∈Cx, (j, k) ∈Cy, and
the seam output pair is legal, i.e. (j, ·) to (·, k) goes through an edge in
A—which is exactly the middle factor. This algebraic view is not needed for
the algorithm (the DP already checks seams), but it explains the role of the
seam explicitly.

NEXPTIME-hardness (explicit β-normalized radius-
1 model)
We prove that Feasible-Function Existence (mid-consistency (F1) only)
for β-normalized, radius-1 LCLs on globally oriented paths is NEXPTIME-
hard. Together with Theorem 2, this yields NEXPTIME-completeness. The
reduction is from Succinct-3SAT: a circuit C of size s defines, for each index
j ∈{0, 1}B, a 3-clause clause(j) over variables x1, . . . , x2B; the question is
whether the 2B-variable CNF ΦC is satisfiable.
What we use from the toolbox.
We rely on (i) the types/replacement/pumping
machinery (Lemmas 10–12, 14–15 in §4 of the reference), and (ii) the error-
chain technique to make malformed encodings harmless (as in §3 of the
reference).11
B.1
Target: FFE(F1) for β-normalized r=1
Recall our feasible-function existence problem FFE(F1): given Σin = {0, 1},
|Σout| = β, Cin–out ⊆Σin×Σout, Cout–out ⊆Σout×Σout, decide if there is a
map f : C →Σ2
out (on context types) satisfying mid-consistency (F1), cf. the
definition in the upper bound section.
B.2
Source and parameters
Let C be a succinct 3CNF generator of size s. Set
B = sc0,
β = sc1,
for large enough absolute constants c0 ≪c1 fixed below. We will build, in
poly(s) time, a β-normalized LCL PC = (Σin, Σout, Cin–out, Cout–out) such
that
ΦC is satisfiable
⇐⇒FFE(F1) holds for PC.
(1)
Since |Σout| = β = poly(s), the type space size ℓpump := |{Type(·)}| satisfies
ℓpump ≤2Θ(β4) = 2poly(s), and hence the contexts in C (those realized by
w1Sw2 with |wi| ∈{ℓpump, ℓpump+1}) cover exponentially many patterns,
which we will exploit.12

B.3
The block language and the verifiers
We describe Σout and the two verifiers in the β-normalized form.
The
construction follows the standard ”copy input and check a tableau by nearest-
neighbor rules” recipe, together with the error-chain gadget that guarantees
malformed inputs never constrain f.13
Alphabet Σout.
Each output symbol encodes a constant number of tracks:
(T1) a bit in which must copy the node’s input bit (enforced by Cin–out);
(T2) a role from a constant set {HEAD, RID, GID, RUN, PAD} and a constant-
size phase (synchronization);
(T3) three colors {RED, GRN, BLU} (used only at the 2-node window S);
(T4) a special plumbing symbol ⊥;
(T5) a bounded collection of error symbols (the error-chain alphabet) as in
§3;
(T6) (for RUN) the working alphabet for a fixed universal TM U running in
BO(1) time.
Thus |Σout| = β = poly(s).
The intended block.
A well-formed block (a regular language over Σout)
has the form
HEADC RID GID RUN PAD,
where:
• HEADC is a self-delimiting binary header that literally stores C on the
in track (copied to output by (T1)) and marks the start of a block.
• RID is a B-bit variable index region; GID is a B-bit clause index region.
• RUN is a row-by-row encoding of a tableau of the fixed machine U which,
given (C, RID, GID), runs for BO(1) steps and computes the three literals
13The radius-1 checking of a 1D flattening of a time poly(B) computation and the
error-chain idea are lifted verbatim from §3 (LBA encoding + locally checkable refutations).

of clause(GID) and their signs, and writes three length-B one-hot vectors
V (+), V (−) and V (⊥) on dedicated subtracks:
V (+)[i] = 1 ⇐⇒xi occurs positively in clause(GID),
V (−)[i] = 1 ⇐⇒¬xi occurs,
and V (⊥) is always all zero (reserved for BLU).
• In variable blocks we also run U on (C, RID) to materialize a variable
one-hot vector HotRID ∈{0, 1}B with HotRID[i] = 1 iff i = RID.
The adjacency table Cout–out permits exactly nearest-neighbor pairs con-
sistent with (i) the grammar above (placement of regions, row separators,
phases), and (ii) single-step correctness of U’s transition across each row
seam; malformed pieces are locally refutable by emitting an error-chain (as
in §3), which we also allow in Cout–out and which always leads to a successful
completion.14
The window S and activation.
The two nodes of the window S (in
contexts w1Sw2) may be labeled at f’s discretion by one of the colors
{RED, GRN, BLU} or by ⊥. No other output is allowed at S. The out–out
grammar is arranged so that:
The choice ⊥at S is always extendible. A non-⊥color at S
is extendible only if somewhere inside w1 (resp. w2) there is a
well-formed block whose HEADC matches the fixed header for C,
and whose RID (resp. GID) and tableau are valid.
We say such contexts are active; all other contexts are inactive. Inactive
contexts are thus tautologically satisfied by setting f(·) = ⊥.
Bridge semantics (the ”clause satisfied by variable” test).
For an
active ordered pair (variable on the left, clause on the right), the bridge (F1)
instance waS1wbwcS2wd is allowed to complete iff
∃i ∈[B] with HotRID[i] = 1 and





V (+)[i] = 1
if f(Type(left)) = RED,
V (−)[i] = 1
if f(Type(left)) = GRN,
V (⊥)[i] = 1
if f(Type(left)) = BLU.
14Exactly as in §3: a fixed finite set of error types and local rules allow every malformed
tableau to be disproved by a short, locally checkable chain; on well-formed encodings such
chains cannot be produced. :contentReference[oaicite:3]index=3
9

--- Page 10 ---
This ”∃i” is checked by a standard radius-1 witness chain: upon a color
choice at S1 and S2, the out–out grammar enables a path that (i) guesses
an index i, (ii) walks to bit i inside the left block and requires HotRID[i] = 1,
and (iii) walks to bit i inside the right block and requires the corresponding
V (·)[i] = 1. If any subcheck fails, the chain gets stuck (no completion). This
is exactly the same local ”existential witness” mechanism as in the error-
chain gadget, so it is implementable with radius 1 and a constant alphabet
overhead.15
All other ordered pairs of context types are trivialized: either at least one
side is inactive (then ⊥suffices), or the role pairing is not (variable, clause),
in which case the grammar ignores the colors and accepts with ⊥buffers.
B.4
Existence of exponentially many active context types
Because ℓpump = 2poly(s) and our header+index+run occupy O(s) + O(B) +
BO(1) = poly(s) symbols, by the pumping lemmas there are context types
that (i) have a valid block with any desired RID ∈{0, 1}B on the left and
(ii) context types that have a valid block with any desired GID on the right.
Moreover, types that differ in RID (or in GID) are distinct because, by design,
extendibility from S under a color differs for some bridge depending on the
bit pattern (the witness chain succeeds or not). Hence there are 2B = 2poly(s)
distinct variable types {Vari} and 2B distinct clause types {Clj} present
in C.16
B.5
Correctness of the reduction
We prove (1).
Lemma 2 (Completeness). If ΦC is satisfiable, then there exists f : C →Σ2
out
satisfying (F1) for PC.
Proof. Fix a satisfying assignment α : {x1, . . . , x2B} →{0, 1}. Define f as
follows.
• For each variable type Vari, set f(Vari) = RED if α(xi) = 1 and
f(Vari) = GRN if α(xi) = 0 (either orientation of S may be chosen; the
grammar handles both).
15Witness chains (existential pointers to positions with local checking) are the same
combinatorics as the §3 error pointers; we reuse their radius-1 implementation. :contentRe-
ference[oaicite:4]index=4
16Realization and stability of these patterns inside wb or wc follow from type compo-
sition and replacement; lengths are padded using pumping (§4, Lemmas 11–12, 14–15).
:contentReference[oaicite:5]index=5
10

--- Page 11 ---
• For each clause type Clj, pick any true literal of clause(j) under α and
set f(Clj) to its color: RED for a positive literal, GRN for a negative
literal (use BLU only if desired as a dummy literal, with V (⊥) ≡0 never
satisfying witnesses).
• For all inactive types, set f(τ) = ⊥.
Consider any ordered pair of contexts in the (F1) quantification. If at least
one side is inactive or the roles are not (variable, clause), the bridge is
trivial by construction. If the pair is (Vari, Clj), then by the definition of
the RUN subtracks we have HotRID[i] = 1 inside Vari, and V (+)[i] = 1 (resp.
V (−)[i] = 1) if we chose RED (resp. GRN) at Clj and the picked literal is xi
(resp. ¬xi). Since f(Clj) is a true literal of clause(j), such a choice exists,
and the bridge DP succeeds via a witness chain at index i. Hence every (F1)
check passes.
Lemma 3 (Soundness). If there exists f satisfying (F1) for PC, then ΦC is
satisfiable.
Proof. From f, read an assignment α by
α(xi) =





1,
f(Vari) = RED,
0,
f(Vari) = GRN,
arbitrary,
f(Vari) = BLU (we may fix it to 0),
for all variable types Vari (if f(Vari) = ⊥, the type is inactive, impossible
by construction of Vari). Fix any clause index j. If f(Clj) = ⊥then Clj is
inactive, which contradicts the existence of the header+RUN in Clj; hence
f(Clj) ∈{RED, GRN, BLU}.
Consider the (F1) bridge for the ordered
pair (Vari, Clj) where i ranges over all variables that appear in clause(j).
The out–out grammar allows completion only if there exists an index i
with HotRID[i] = 1 in Vari and the corresponding V (+)[i] = 1 (for RED)
or V (−)[i] = 1 (for GRN) in Clj. Because (F1) must hold for every such
ordered pair, the choice f(Clj) must be compatible with at least one Vari
that actually occurs in clause(j); therefore the picked color is a true literal
under α. Since j was arbitrary, every clause has a true literal: α satisfies
ΦC.
Lemma 4 (Inactive contexts never constrain f). If a context lacks a well-
formed header+indices+valid RUN (on either side), then any output at S
except ⊥makes the (F1) bridge DP fail, while ⊥always extends. Thus such
contexts are irrelevant and do not affect the existence of f.
11

--- Page 12 ---
Proof. Both statements follow from the grammar: non-⊥at S activates
witness chains that must eventually check bits inside a block; in the absence
of a valid block the chain gets stuck and no completion exists. Conversely,
when S is ⊥, the out–out table contains a self-looping ⊥buffer language that
trivially completes the bridge (the same plumbing as in the upper-bound
DP). The error-chain rules guarantee that malformed fragments admit locally
checkable refutations and hence do not impose constraints.17
Theorem 3 (FFE(F1) is NEXPTIME-complete). For β-normalized, radius-
1 LCLs on globally oriented paths (explicit model), Feasible-Function
Existence is NEXPTIME-complete.
Proof. Membership is Theorem 2. For hardness, the reduction C 7→PC runs
in poly(s) time and produces |Σout| = β = poly(s) with adjacency tables of
size Θ(β2). By Lemmas 2–4, (1) holds. Hence FFE(F1) is NEXPTIME-
hard.
B.6
From (F1) to the full feasible-function (F1)+(F2)
To pass from mid-consistency to the full feasible-function existence (bridging
included), add a neutral symbol ⊥(already present) and allow, in Cout–out,
arbitrary ⊥-labelings on repetitions wz
1 and wz
2. Then (F2) is vacuous: for
every context (w1, S, w2) and every z ≥1, the partial labeling that fixes S
to f(Type(w1Sw2)) extends by filling wz
i with ⊥. Hence:
Corollary 1 (Classification hardness). Deciding the distributed class (O(1)

High-level assessment: All four reports move in a coherent direction (reduce Succinct 3-Coloring to (F1) by separating vertex types and simulating D(u,v) across the seam; neutralize (F2) with a ⊥-filler). The overall plan is promising and consistent with our DP/type framework. However, only informal sketches are given; several key points require correction or formalization before anything can move to output.md.

Major issues and corrections:
- Prover 01’s Lemma 1 (single fixed probe b⋆) is not viable as stated. With global rules fixed, a single boundary-output 4-tuple cannot distinguish 2^B many indices; the check “agree with a constant j-th bit of the target u” cannot depend on u unless u comes from the interior. If the probe only checks RID equals the adjacent input RID, then the test always accepts and cannot separate types. We need a family of probes indexed by boundary outputs (as in Provers 02/03/04) so acceptance depends on u.
- Consistency of f on the same u across multiple types: The proposed soundness arguments sometimes rely on the pair (τ_u, τ_u) enforcing equal colors. That is not guaranteed if D(u,u)=0 (typically true), because the seam accepts irrespective of colors for non-edges. Therefore we must either (i) engineer that there is exactly one “active” left-type and one “active” right-type per u (all other contexts are inactive and cannot carry colors), or (ii) enforce a same-u consistency constraint separately. The clean approach is (i): design canonical vertex-context shapes L(u), R(v) that are the only contexts allowed to place color tokens at S; all other contexts are inactive and any non-⊥ at S dead-ends locally.
- Error-chain robustness: In all probe and seam gadgets, ensure the “error alphabet” does not provide an alternative accepting continuation under a reserved probe. Under a reserved probe boundary pattern, the only legal continuation must be the deterministic pointer/run; if a check fails, there must be no error-escape. Conversely, in non-probe modes and for malformed interiors, an error-chain must exist to avoid constraining f.
- Radius-1 feasibility and alphabet sizing: Pointer/counting mechanisms that must reach the j-th port cell need either O(B) pointer states or an address field in the port zone. Both are acceptable because β is polynomial in s and can be chosen with c1 ≥ c0 so β ≥ B. Avoid claims that a constant-state pointer can hit arbitrary j without an address field.
- Definition of types vs fixed inputs: Be explicit that E_w(a) is computed with the interior input string fixed to that of w. Several sketches implicitly use this; we should state it clearly in output.md (a minor clarification only).

Promising directions to consolidate:
- Type separation: Prefer either (A) the per-bit probe family Q_j (Prover 04) with an O(B)-symbol address field in the port zone so that extendibility under Q_j equals u_j, or (B) the mask/parity probe family (Prover 03) with M ≥ B tests and an injective signature Sig(u) = (⟨M_t,u⟩) that is enforced by a deterministic pointer+RUN gadget. Both are radius-1 and use β = poly(s). Prover 02’s base-β^4 encoding of a probe index b is also fine but heavier than needed; using M = Θ(B) probes suffices to separate 2^B vertices.
- Canonical vertex contexts: Fix L(u) and R(v) shapes that alone unlock the “color-at-S” role; all other contexts must forbid color tokens at S (inactive). This avoids the need to prove equality of f on multiple types representing the same u.
- Seam gadget: The row-by-row 1D tableau simulation across the bridge that reads u, v from adjacent port zones and evaluates D(u,v) in poly(s) time is standard (nearest-neighbor checks); gate acceptance by (EDGE=0) or (EDGE=1 and colors differ). This is the right alignment with (F1).
- Neutralize (F2): The global ⊥-plumbing on repetitions is compatible with keeping (F1) unchanged. Just ensure it never alters S’s positions or the “vertex role” gating.

Concrete next steps (what to write down explicitly so we can verify by the O(kβ^2) DP):
1) Pick and fully specify one type-separation gadget. If choosing per-bit probes Q_j:
   - Define the port zone layout: B addressed cells adjacent to S with an address track Addr∈{1,…,B} and a data track RID∈{0,1}.
   - Define the boundary-reserved outputs Q_j and show the only legal continuation is a deterministic pointer that moves to the unique cell with Addr=j and accepts iff RID=1.
   - Prove the Type-Separation Lemma: for a fixed boundary-input a⋆, E_{L(u)}(a⋆)[Q_j]=u_j; hence Type(L(u)) ≠ Type(L(u′)) for u≠u′.
2) Define canonical L(u), R(v) shapes precisely: lengths, offsets of headers, port zones, and RUN zones. Add local rules that permit color tokens at S only when the adjacent block is a well-formed vertex block.
3) Specify the seam tableau alphabet and local constraints: how the bridge reads the two B-bit ports, how the final EDGE bit is emitted, and the local check that enforces “if EDGE=1 then colors differ, else accept.” Include the refutation for malformed rows.
4) Integrate ⊥-plumbing for (F2) and explicitly state that it never touches S or overrides the vertex-role gating.
5) Provide a small B=2 instance and brute-force the DP to validate the separation and seam behavior.

If the above is written concretely, we can start moving the Type-Separation Lemma and the Seam Gadget Lemma (with full local rule tables) into output.md. Until then, no new theorems are publication-ready.

Working model and notation (radius 1, β-normalized)
- We study LCLs on globally oriented paths with fixed input alphabet Σ_in and output alphabet Σ_out of size β. The local legality is given by two global relations: Cin–out relating each input symbol to allowed output symbols at a node, and Cout–out relating allowed pairs of consecutive output symbols. The radius is 1.
- A path segment w has four boundary nodes (two on the left, two on the right). For a fixed assignment to the four boundary inputs, we define the extendibility bitvector over all β^4 assignments to the four boundary outputs indicating for which boundary-output assignments there exists a legal extension to the interior.
- The type Type(w) is the collection, over all 4-boundary input assignments, of these extendibility bitvectors. Two words share a type if they have identical extendibility behavior for all boundary input/output assignments. Let T be the finite set of all types realizable by some word.

Verified technical facts (recorded in output.md)
- Type bound: |T| ≤ |Σ_in|^4 · 2^{β^4}. Reason: a type is determined by four boundary input symbols and a Boolean function on the β^4 boundary output assignments.
- Composition lemma: There is a computable binary operation ⊛ on T such that Type(uv) = Type(u) ⊛ Type(v) for all words u, v. Intuition: to decide extendibility of uv under a boundary-output assignment, one needs only (i) the extendibility tables of u and v, and (ii) existentially quantify over the two internal boundary outputs to satisfy Cout–out at the join.
- Periodicity: For any fixed word w, the sequence τ_z := Type(w^z) is ultimately periodic with preperiod and period ≤ |T|. Thus the pair sequence (Type(w1^z), Type(w2^z)) is ultimately periodic with preperiod ≤ 2|T| and period ≤ |T|.
- Finite-Z for (F2): Given any context (w1, S, w2), whether the (F2) check passes for all z ≥ 1 depends only on finitely many pairs (Type(w1^z), Type(w2^z)); it suffices to check z up to Z ≤ |T|^2 (a non-tight but simple bound).
- DP for extension: For a fixed path with some outputs forced (e.g., on S), the existence of a global completion can be decided in O(k β^2) time for a length-k path by a layered dynamic program over output symbols.

Hardness direction we will pursue (pivot suggested by Prover 01)
- Source problem: Succinct 3-Coloring of a graph G on V={0,1}^B, given by a circuit D(u,v) (size s) deciding adjacency; NEXP-complete.
- Target LCL: Construct a β-normalized, r=1 instance P_D with Σ_out size β = poly(s). The plan:
  1) For each u, build at least one context type τ_u whose boundary behavior (detected via a reserved boundary-probe) certifies that the interior encodes the index u in a standard, radius-1-checkable block. The interior also stores a copy of D on an input track and a runzone for a fixed TM U.
  2) In a bridge between τ_u and τ_v, locally simulate U on input (D,u,v) across the seam for poly(s) steps to evaluate D(u,v); malformed simulations are locally refutable.
  3) Gate constraints: if D(u,v)=0 (non-edge) allow completion regardless of colors; if D(u,v)=1 enforce color inequality across S. All other pairings (not recognized as vertex–vertex) are trivial.
  4) Assigning a color to each τ_u by a feasible function f is then exactly a proper 3-coloring of G.
  5) Make (F2) vacuous by allowing repeated sides to be filled with a globally available ⊥-plumbing language.

Open technical items for hardness (to be formalized next)
- Boundary-probe/type-separation lemma: Exhibit a fixed boundary-output probe that, when used, triggers an interior index-check subroutine; show that for distinct indices u ≠ u′, the probe’s extendibility bit differs, hence τ_u ≠ τ_{u′}.
- Seam handshake and computation: Specify the constant-size interface by which the bridge accesses (via pointers) the interior encodings of u and v and runs the 1D tableau for U for poly(s) steps, with radius-1 local checks and robust error refutations.
- Alphabet/size bookkeeping: Keep Σ_out constant tracks (roles, colors, error, U’s work alphabet) constant, with β = poly(s) sufficient for all auxiliary symbols.
- Soundness/completeness proof for the reduction P_D: G is 3-colorable iff a feasible f exists for P_D (with (F2) neutralized).

Caveats and corrections logged
- Short seam codes cannot distinguish exponentially many indices; instead use constant-size pointers/handshakes plus interior blocks that store and validate indices.
- Do not attempt to “program arbitrary boundary truth tables per type” via Cout–out; all rules are global. Use boundary probes plus uniform interior checks to separate types.
- For 3SAT-based reductions, the (F1) universal quantifier clashes with clause-level existential quantification unless one adds complex nondeterministic gating. The succinct 3-coloring pivot avoids this.
Refined hardness plan via Succinct 3-Coloring: type separation and seam simulation (radius 1)

Parameters and normalization
- Given a succinct graph instance D of size s over V={0,1}^B with B=s^{c0}, choose β=s^{c1} with c1≥c0 so β≥B and the output alphabet Σ_out has size β. The LCL instance P_D has radius 1 and is β-normalized (Cin–out global, Cout–out nearest-neighbor global). The DP and type framework from output.md applies with |T|≤|Σ_in|^4·2^{β^4}.

Canonical vertex contexts and activity gating
- We will construct canonical context shapes L(u)=W_L(u) S F_R and R(v)=F_L S W_R(v) for each u,v∈{0,1}^B such that:
  1) W_L(u) (resp. W_R(v)) is a well-formed vertex block anchored O(1) from S; it exposes a port zone of length Θ(B) immediately adjacent to S holding the index bits.
  2) Only these canonical contexts permit color tokens at S (role gating). Any context that is not a canonical vertex context is inactive: any non-⊥ token at S dead-ends locally; ⊥ at S always extends via neutral plumbing.
  3) For each u (resp. v) the type Type(L(u)) (resp. Type(R(v))) depends only on u (resp. v) via a boundary-probe mechanism detailed below. Thus we obtain at least 2^B distinct left-types and 2^B distinct right-types.

Type separation via a family of boundary probes (two workable options)
- Option A (per-bit probes Q_j with address field): Reserve B distinct boundary-output 4-tuples {Q_j : j∈[B]}. In the port zone, include an address track Addr∈[B] and a data track RID∈{0,1}. Local rules enforce that under boundary outputs Q_j the only legal continuation is a deterministic pointer that walks from the boundary to the unique port cell with Addr=j and then accepts iff RID=1 at that cell; otherwise no continuation exists. For all non-reserved boundary outputs we allow generic ⊥-plumbing so they do not affect separation. Fix a boundary-input pattern a⋆. Then for each u we have E_{L(u)}(a⋆)[Q_j]=u_j. Consequently, u≠u′ implies Type(L(u))≠Type(L(u′)). This uses O(B) extra symbols (addresses/pointer states) and remains within β=poly(s).
- Option B (mask/parity probes with M≥B tests): Reserve M boundary-output 4-tuples {b_t : t∈[M]} with M≥B. Store in the input of W_L(u) a table of M masks M_t∈{0,1}^B (with the B×M matrix of full rank over GF(2)) and the RID block u. Under boundary outputs b_t, a deterministic pointer reads M_t and then the RID block and accumulates the inner product ⟨M_t,u⟩ mod 2 using a small “RUN” zone (row-by-row locally checked). Accept iff the parity is 1. Define Sig(u)=(⟨M_t,u⟩)_t∈{0,1}^M; Sig is injective because M≥B and the masks are independent. Fixing a boundary-input a⋆, E_{L(u)}(a⋆)[b_t]=Sig(u)_t, so types differ for distinct u. Again, the probe behavior is radius-1 and β=poly(s) suffices.
- In both options, under reserved probes the control is deterministic (no error-chain escape). Outside reserved probes, error-chains and ⊥-plumbing ensure malformed interiors do not constrain f.

Seam gadget for succinct adjacency and color inequality
- In an (F1) instance on L(u) seam R(v), the bridge wb∘wc hosts a row-by-row simulation of a fixed TM U that evaluates D(u,v) in poly(s) steps:
  1) The port zones adjacent to S on each side expose the B-bit strings u and v. A small handshake track opens a corridor through wb∘wc where U’s tableau is laid out.
  2) Cout–out enforces nearest-neighbor consistency between successive rows; malformed rows are locally refutable (no accepting continuation). The run emits a verdict bit EDGE∈{0,1} at a fixed place near S.
  3) Local acceptance: If EDGE=0 (non-edge), admit completion irrespective of colors at S; if EDGE=1 (edge), admit completion iff the two color tokens at the two S nodes differ. These are radius-1 checks.
- If either side is inactive (not a canonical vertex context), a ⊥-plumbing language allows completion irrespective of the other side and the colors; however, the role gating forbids colors at S for inactive types, so mapping inactive types to a color would violate (F1) on some pair.

Neutralizing (F2)
- Add a global ⊥-filler that, for any context (w_1,S,w_2) and any z≥1, allows filling w_1^z and w_2^z entirely with ⊥ symbols, consistent with any boundary outputs and inputs, without altering the two S positions or the vertex-role gating. Then (F2) holds for every f, reducing the 3-way classification on this family to (F1)-feasibility.

Why this matches our DP/type framework
- Types are defined with respect to fixed inputs; the reserved-probe acceptance depends only on the interior index u and the chosen boundary 4-tuple, so it is type-invariant. The DP in O(kβ^2) can verify both probe behavior and seam runs on small test instances (e.g., B=2), giving a concrete auditable path.

Key cautions to enforce in the local rules
- Reserved probes must have a unique legal continuation (deterministic pointer/run); no error-chain may provide an alternative accepting path.
- Color tokens at S must be gated by the vertex role; inactive contexts cannot place colors, ensuring f is only free on canonical vertex types and ⊥ elsewhere.
- The seam gadget must accept for non-edges regardless of colors and enforce inequality for edges; malformed simulations must not accept.

Minimal sanity check (B=2)
- Use Option A with Q_1,Q_2 and an Addr track {1,2} in the port zone. For u∈{00,01,10,11}, the vector (E_{L(u)}(a⋆)[Q_1], E_{L(u)}(a⋆)[Q_2]) equals u. The seam gadget with a small circuit D (e.g., a 4-cycle) enforces inequality exactly on edges, which can be brute-forced by the DP.

Results validated for radius-1, β-normalized LCLs on oriented paths

Why these results matter
- The decision procedures for feasible-function existence (and hence the O(1)/Θ(log* n)/Θ(n) classification on paths) rely on two ingredients: (i) that path segments admit a finite set of “types” which compose under concatenation, and (ii) that extendibility of partially labeled paths can be checked efficiently. The theorems below formalize these facts for radius 1 and yield a finite bound for the bridging (F2) checks.

Definitions (radius 1)
- Fix finite alphabets Σ_in and Σ_out (|Σ_out| = β). Cin–out ⊆ Σ_in × Σ_out specifies allowed output symbols at a node given its input symbol. Cout–out ⊆ Σ_out × Σ_out specifies allowed pairs of consecutive output symbols along the oriented path. A labeling of outputs y_1…y_k over an input x_1…x_k is legal if (x_i, y_i) ∈ Cin–out for all i and (y_i, y_{i+1}) ∈ Cout–out for all i.
- For a word w of length k ≥ 2, let the four boundary positions be i=1,2 and i=k-1,k. For a fixed assignment a ∈ Σ_in^4 to the boundary inputs (x_1, x_2, x_{k-1}, x_k), define E_w(a) ⊆ Σ_out^4 to be the set of boundary-output assignments b = (y_1, y_2, y_{k-1}, y_k) for which there exists a legal output labeling y_1…y_k extending b, given the boundary inputs a (interior inputs may be arbitrary in Σ_in; if the model fixes interior inputs, the definition is with respect to those fixed inputs). The type of w, Type(w), is the map a ↦ E_w(a). Let T be the set of all types realized by some w.

Theorem 1 (Finite number of types and an explicit bound)
Let m := |Σ_in|. For radius 1 we have |T| ≤ m^4 · 2^{β^4}.
Proof. For each fixed boundary-input assignment a there are exactly β^4 possible boundary-output assignments; E_w(a) is an arbitrary subset of these, hence at most 2^{β^4} possibilities. There are m^4 possible a’s. The type is fully determined by the tuple (a, E_w(a))_{a∈Σ_in^4}. Thus the total number of distinct types is at most m^4 · 2^{β^4}.

Lemma 2 (Composition of types under concatenation)
There is a computable binary operation ⊛: T × T → T such that for all words u, v we have Type(uv) = Type(u) ⊛ Type(v).
Proof. Fix boundary inputs a on uv, i.e., inputs on positions 1,2 and at the last two positions of uv. For each boundary-outputs choice b on uv, extendibility is equivalent to the existence of output symbols p,q ∈ Σ_out at the shared boundary between u and v (the last two outputs of u = first two of v) such that:
- (i) (Type(u) under its corresponding boundary inputs) accepts the boundary outputs given by the left two outputs of b together with p,q; and
- (ii) (Type(v) under its corresponding boundary inputs) accepts p,q together with the right two outputs of b; and
- (iii) the two internal adjacencies across the u|v seam are allowed by Cout–out (these involve only (y_{|u|-1}, y_{|u|}) = (p_left, p_right) and (p_left, p_right) = (y_1, y_2) of v, but these are exactly the p,q we quantify over).
Because radius is 1, no other interior constraints couple u and v. Thus extendibility of uv under (a,b) can be decided solely from Type(u), Type(v), and Cout–out by existentially quantifying p,q. Defining ⊛ to implement this decision for all (a,b) yields Type(uv) = Type(u) ⊛ Type(v).

Lemma 3 (Ultimate periodicity of repeated concatenation)
Fix w and let τ := Type(w). Define the sequence σ_1, σ_2, … in T by σ_z := Type(w^z). Then σ_{z+1} = σ_z ⊛ τ for all z ≥ 1. Consequently, the sequence (σ_z) is ultimately periodic with preperiod and period at most |T|.
Proof. By Lemma 2, σ_{z+1} = Type(w^{z+1}) = Type(w^z w) = Type(w^z) ⊛ Type(w) = σ_z ⊛ τ. Since T is finite, the sequence must revisit a previous value within at most |T| steps, after which it evolves deterministically with fixed period ≤ |T|.

Corollary 4 (Finite bound for the bridging (F2) check)
Let ℓ := |T|. Fix a context (w_1, S, w_2) with |S| = 2 and a forced output assignment s ∈ Σ_out^2 on S. For each z ≥ 1, consider the path w_1^z S w_2^z with S fixed to s, and let P(z) be the predicate “there exists a legal completion of outputs on w_1^z and w_2^z consistent with s.” Then P(z) depends only on the pair (Type(w_1^z), Type(w_2^z)). Moreover, it suffices to check P(z) for 1 ≤ z ≤ Z with Z ≤ ℓ^2; if all these hold then P(z) holds for all z ≥ 1.
Proof. For fixed s, feasibility is determined by whether there exist outputs on the two boundary nodes adjacent to S on each side such that the two segments extend and Cout–out holds across the two adjacencies touching S; this depends only on Type(w_1^z) and Type(w_2^z). By Lemma 3, each of the two type sequences is ultimately periodic with preperiod and period ≤ ℓ. Hence the pair sequence (Type(w_1^z), Type(w_2^z)) takes values in a set of size ≤ ℓ^2 and is ultimately periodic. If P(z) holds for one full traversal of the distinct pairs (which occurs within the first ℓ^2 indices), it holds for all subsequent z.

Theorem 5 (DP for extension on a partially labeled path)
Given a path of length k with a fixed input string and some outputs preassigned on a subset of nodes, there is an O(k β^2) time algorithm that decides whether the outputs can be completed to a legal labeling.
Proof. Construct a layered graph with k layers, each layer’s vertices being the output symbols allowed at that node by Cin–out and any preassignment. Add a directed edge from y at layer i to y′ at layer i+1 iff (y, y′) ∈ Cout–out. There exists a legal completion iff there is a path from some vertex in layer 1 to some vertex in layer k. The graph has O(k β) vertices and O(k β^2) edges; reachability is decidable in O(k β^2).

Remarks
- The bounds above are not tight (e.g., the ℓ^2 bound in Corollary 4 can be improved using lcm of periods), but they suffice for verification in exponential time in β. They also isolate exactly where only the types matter (composition and periodicity), which is crucial for hardness reductions that aim to make (F2) vacuous and focus on (F1).
