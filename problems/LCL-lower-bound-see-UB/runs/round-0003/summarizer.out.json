  "summary_md": "Round 0003 produced a converging patch that (a) enforces active seams so \u22a5 at S is forbidden in active contexts, (b) restricts the clause S-palette to occurrences {O1,O2,O3} and binds signs to the verified RUN, and (c) implements a radius\u20111 Exclusivity Lemma for equality vs. inequality witness chains. Two complementary seam designs were presented (input-coded DoorVar/DoorCl/DoorPAD and Offer/NoOffer); nearest\u2011block barriers (preferred by the verifier) or a RepeatPAD pattern were proposed to make (F2) hold without trivializing (F1). Core invariants are one\u2011hot RID, redundant binary lanes, pointer\u2011integrity tiles, and a monotone eq_so_far/neq mode that gates CAP vs PAD. B=2 toy traces were sketched to sanity\u2011check ON/OFF cases. Outstanding concrete artifacts requested by the verifier: explicit Cout/Cin seam tables, de Bruijn\u2011style pointer tiles, a RUN tile set, and a full 12\u2011node B=2 DP trace. Basis: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json, prover-03.out.json.",
  "highlights": [
    "Explicit radius\u20111 seam activation implemented (DoorVar/DoorCl/DoorPAD or Offer/NoOffer) with CertStart gating, so \u22a5 at S is forbidden when both sides are active.",
    "Clause-side S palette limited to occurrences {O1,O2,O3}; sign bits are read from the verified RUN near S, preventing local sign cheating.",
    "Exclusivity Lemma: two local witness chains (Equality and Inequality) implemented bit\u2011by\u2011bit with one\u2011hot + binary invariants and an eq_so_far/neq mode guarantee exactly one certificate (CAP vs PAD) per ordered pair.",
    "OFF pairs are neutral: Inequality emits PAD and a PAD sublanguage / DoorPAD completion provides a filler independent of f, so non\u2011selected pairs impose no constraints.",
    "(F2) handled via nearest\u2011block barriers that stop witness cursors one block away from S, so repeating w1/w2 copies tiles independently; RepeatPAD was offered as an alternate but verifier prefers barriers.",
    "Remaining concrete work: enumerate Cin/Cout tables, give explicit pointer/addressing tiles (de Bruijn\u2011like), produce RUN tile rules, and a complete B=2 12\u2011node DP trace; verifier flagged avoiding a tester clause j* if possible."

  "next_questions": [
    "Provide full Cin\u2013out / Cout\u2013out seam tables enumerating every allowed adjacent pair (Offer/NoOffer, CertStart, CAP/PAD, witness-step tokens) and show these are enforceable with radius\u20111 tiles.",
    "Specify the pointer/addressing tile set (de Bruijn\u2011style) and prove locally (\u22642 steps) that any attempt to spoof bit values or addresses is locally refuted; include the RUN tile rows that expose Occ[p] and sgn[p].",
    "Produce a concrete B=2 DP trace (~12 nodes) showing one ON and one OFF ordered pair end\u2011to\u2011end (seam interactions, CertStart, equality/inequality traversal, CAP vs PAD, and sign gating); also decide whether to keep or remove the tester clause j* (verifier prefers removal)."
