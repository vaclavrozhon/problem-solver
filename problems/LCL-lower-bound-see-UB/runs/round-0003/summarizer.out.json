  "summary_md": "This round (prover-04) pins down three auditable, radius-1 gadgets for the S3Col \u2192 FFE(F1) reduction: (1) Lemma TS: a family of reserved per-bit boundary probes Q_j with pointer heads P_j deterministically walk a nearby PORT zone and test RidBit[j], so E_{L(u)}(a\u22c6)[Q_j]=u_j and there are \u22652^B distinct left (and symmetrically right) canonical types; probe-mode explicitly disables error-escape. (2) Lemma CG: an ACT handshake gates non-\u22a5 colors at the two S nodes so only canonical vertex contexts can be colored (others must be \u22a5). (3) Lemma Seam: a nearest-neighbor bridge tableau simulates a universal TM to compute EDGE = D(u,v) and enforces locally that EDGE=1 \u21d2 S-colors differ (EDGE=0 accepts unconditionally). Alphabet/radius bookkeeping (O(B) reserved symbols, \u03b2 = poly(s)) and a global \u22a5-filler to neutralize (F2) are given. Next deliverables are explicit Cin/Cout tables and a B=2 DP regression. One remaining point to clarify: explicit left/right color-consistency (Eq) enforcement.",
  "highlights": [
    "Lemma TS: Reserved boundary 4-tuples Q_j + pointer heads P_j yield a deterministic probe pipeline; under Q_j the DP extends iff RidBit[j]=1, so E_{L(u)}(a\u22c6)[Q_j]=u_j and types separate into \u22652^B classes (radius-1).",
    "Probe discipline: While a probe is active the error-chain alphabet is disabled locally\u2014no alternative continuations\u2014so probe results cannot be spoofed by ERR/\u22a5 escapes.",
    "Lemma CG (Color Gating): An ACT handshake (local radius-1 role) allows RED/GRN/BLU at S iff the adjacent side is a canonical HEAD+PORT block; otherwise any non-\u22a5 color at S is a dead end, forcing inactive types to be \u22a5.",
    "Lemma Seam: The bridge hosts a row-by-row 1D tableau (nearest-neighbor rules) that reads u,v, outputs EDGE = D(u,v), forwards Color(S1) and enforces locally: EDGE=0 \u21d2 accept; EDGE=1 \u21d2 accept only if colors differ.",
    "Alphabet/radius bookkeeping: \u03a3_out uses O(B) extra symbols (Addr, Q_j, P_j) plus O(1) work/error tracks; choose \u03b2 \u2265 c\u00b7B so \u03b2 = poly(s) suffices; all constraints are radius-1.",
    "F2 neutralized: add global \u22a5-filler for repeats so (F2) is always satisfiable; reduction reduces to (F1). Planned verifications: explicit Cin/Cout tables and a B=2 DP regression."

  "next_questions": [
    "Produce explicit Cin\u2013out and Cout\u2013out neighbor-pair tables for the probe pipeline (reserved Q_j, states P_j, pointer moves, Addr-local test and accept/dead-end) and confirm the exact \u03b2 budget (\u03b2 \u2265 c\u00b7B).",
    "Specify the seam tableau alphabet and per-row transitions, the final EDGE emission, and the exact radius-1 S-adjacent checks; explicitly (re)introduce/verify an Eq (left/right equality) test or argument to guarantee left/right color-consistency across copies of the same vertex.",
    "Build a machine-readable B=2 instance (full symbol tables and a\u22c6) and run the verifier's O(k\u00b7\u03b2^2) DP to (i) confirm probe-based type separation, (ii) validate seam acceptance behavior on all ordered pairs, and (iii) test the \u22a5-filler neutrality. Also add a note in output.md clarifying E_w(a) is computed with respect to the fixed interior inputs of w."
