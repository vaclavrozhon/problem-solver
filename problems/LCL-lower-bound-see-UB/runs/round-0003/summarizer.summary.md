This round (prover-04) pins down three auditable, radius-1 gadgets for the S3Col → FFE(F1) reduction: (1) Lemma TS: a family of reserved per-bit boundary probes Q_j with pointer heads P_j deterministically walk a nearby PORT zone and test RidBit[j], so E_{L(u)}(a⋆)[Q_j]=u_j and there are ≥2^B distinct left (and symmetrically right) canonical types; probe-mode explicitly disables error-escape. (2) Lemma CG: an ACT handshake gates non-⊥ colors at the two S nodes so only canonical vertex contexts can be colored (others must be ⊥). (3) Lemma Seam: a nearest-neighbor bridge tableau simulates a universal TM to compute EDGE = D(u,v) and enforces locally that EDGE=1 ⇒ S-colors differ (EDGE=0 accepts unconditionally). Alphabet/radius bookkeeping (O(B) reserved symbols, β = poly(s)) and a global ⊥-filler to neutralize (F2) are given. Next deliverables are explicit Cin/Cout tables and a B=2 DP regression. One remaining point to clarify: explicit left/right color-consistency (Eq) enforcement.
