Round 0003 produced a converging patch that (a) enforces active seams so ⊥ at S is forbidden in active contexts, (b) restricts the clause S-palette to occurrences {O1,O2,O3} and binds signs to the verified RUN, and (c) implements a radius‑1 Exclusivity Lemma for equality vs. inequality witness chains. Two complementary seam designs were presented (input-coded DoorVar/DoorCl/DoorPAD and Offer/NoOffer); nearest‑block barriers (preferred by the verifier) or a RepeatPAD pattern were proposed to make (F2) hold without trivializing (F1). Core invariants are one‑hot RID, redundant binary lanes, pointer‑integrity tiles, and a monotone eq_so_far/neq mode that gates CAP vs PAD. B=2 toy traces were sketched to sanity‑check ON/OFF cases. Outstanding concrete artifacts requested by the verifier: explicit Cout/Cin seam tables, de Bruijn‑style pointer tiles, a RUN tile set, and a full 12‑node B=2 DP trace.
