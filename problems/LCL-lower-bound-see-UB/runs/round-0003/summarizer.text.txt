{"summary_md":"Round 0003 produced a converging patch that (a) enforces active seams so ⊥ at S is forbidden in active contexts, (b) restricts the clause S-palette to occurrences {O1,O2,O3} and binds signs to the verified RUN, and (c) implements a radius‑1 Exclusivity Lemma for equality vs. inequality witness chains. Two complementary seam designs were presented (input-coded DoorVar/DoorCl/DoorPAD and Offer/NoOffer); nearest‑block barriers (preferred by the verifier) or a RepeatPAD pattern were proposed to make (F2) hold without trivializing (F1). Core invariants are one‑hot RID, redundant binary lanes, pointer‑integrity tiles, and a monotone eq_so_far/neq mode that gates CAP vs PAD. B=2 toy traces were sketched to sanity‑check ON/OFF cases. Outstanding concrete artifacts requested by the verifier: explicit Cout/Cin seam tables, de Bruijn‑style pointer tiles, a RUN tile set, and a full 12‑node B=2 DP trace. Basis: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json, prover-03.out.json.","highlights":["Explicit radius‑1 seam activation implemented (DoorVar/DoorCl/DoorPAD or Offer/NoOffer) with CertStart gating, so ⊥ at S is forbidden when both sides are active.","Clause-side S palette limited to occurrences {O1,O2,O3}; sign bits are read from the verified RUN near S, preventing local sign cheating.","Exclusivity Lemma: two local witness chains (Equality and Inequality) implemented bit‑by‑bit with one‑hot + binary invariants and an eq_so_far/neq mode guarantee exactly one certificate (CAP vs PAD) per ordered pair.","OFF pairs are neutral: Inequality emits PAD and a PAD sublanguage / DoorPAD completion provides a filler independent of f, so non‑selected pairs impose no constraints.","(F2) handled via nearest‑block barriers that stop witness cursors one block away from S, so repeating w1/w2 copies tiles independently; RepeatPAD was offered as an alternate but verifier prefers barriers.","Remaining concrete work: enumerate Cin/Cout tables, give explicit pointer/addressing tiles (de Bruijn‑like), produce RUN tile rules, and a complete B=2 12‑node DP trace; verifier flagged avoiding a tester clause j* if possible."],"next_questions":["Provide full Cin–out / Cout–out seam tables enumerating every allowed adjacent pair (Offer/NoOffer, CertStart, CAP/PAD, witness-step tokens) and show these are enforceable with radius‑1 tiles.","Specify the pointer/addressing tile set (de Bruijn‑style) and prove locally (≤2 steps) that any attempt to spoof bit values or addresses is locally refuted; include the RUN tile rows that expose Occ[p] and sgn[p].","Produce a concrete B=2 DP trace (~12 nodes) showing one ON and one OFF ordered pair end‑to‑end (seam interactions, CertStart, equality/inequality traversal, CAP vs PAD, and sign gating); also decide whether to keep or remove the tester clause j* (verifier prefers removal)."]}
