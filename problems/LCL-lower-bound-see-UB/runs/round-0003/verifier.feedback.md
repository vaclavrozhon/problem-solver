High-level assessment
- All four reports converge on a coherent strategy: (i) construct exponentially many vertex-context types via a uniform, radius-1 per-bit probe family {Q_j}; (ii) gate colors at S to canonical vertex blocks; (iii) implement a seam tableau that computes D(u,v) and enforces inequality on edges; (iv) neutralize (F2) by a global ⊥-plumbing. Prover 02 additionally proposes an Eq(u,v) gate to force consistency across left/right copies of the same vertex.

Strengths and correctness
- The per-bit probe idea is sound in our static LCL model: reserving O(B) boundary-output 4-tuples and O(B) probe-head states Head_j allows radius-1, globally uniform constraints that force a unique “probe mode” continuation, walking to the unique Addr=j cell and accepting iff RID[j]=1 (RID tied to Σ_in by Cin–out). This yields E_{L(u)}(a⋆)[Q_j]=u_j for a fixed boundary input a⋆, hence 2^B distinct left-types; symmetric on the right. Alphabet/radius bookkeeping is consistent (β=poly(s), β≥Ω(B)).
- The seam tableau concept is standard: a row-by-row 1D simulation across the bridge that reads enc(D), u, v and emits EDGE (and optionally Eq). Enforcing “EDGE=1 ⇒ colors differ” via radius-1 checks between S and its near neighbor is feasible, as is adding “Eq=1 ⇒ colors equal.” Disabling error-chains in active modes prevents spurious accepting completions.

Gaps, risks, and needed corrections
1) Color gating vs mixed pairs: Some text (esp. Prover 02) suggests that if one side is inactive and the other side is colored, the pair dead-ends. That would make any f that colors canonical types infeasible, because mixed (active, inactive) pairs are unavoidable in F1. The fix: allow color on a canonical side regardless of the opposite side; make the seam “active” only if both sides are canonical (both handshakes present). Mixed pairs must accept unconditionally (with the inactive side carrying ⊥ by gating), so f can color canonical types and map inactive types to ⊥ without violating F1.
2) Must-color policy: If both sides are canonical, we may enforce “must color” (both S nodes non-⊥) to prevent trivial satisfactions; but this must not leak to mixed pairs. Clarify this locality in the rules: “must-color” triggers only when both handshakes are present.
3) S-symbol control by f: Ensure the only component of the S output chosen by f is the color/⊥ token; any auxiliary phase/handshake bits at S must be fixed by local adjacency with the internal neighbors, not by f. Otherwise f would need to be context-aware.
4) Eq gating is a helpful addition (Prover 02): it forces consistency across duplicates by making (L(u),R(u)) acceptance contingent on color equality. This avoids having to prove uniqueness of the canonical type per u. Please incorporate Eq into the seam policy: accept iff (EDGE=0 or colors differ) and (Eq=0 or colors equal), with “must-color” only in active-active pairs.
5) Length normalization: Several proofs appeal to pumping/replacement lemmas to place W_L(u),W_R(v) adjacent to S at lengths ℓ_pump or ℓ_pump+1. We have not formalized these lemmas in output.md; until they are provided (or we give a direct construction), the existence of canonical contexts at the prescribed lengths remains an assumption. Move this to notes; do not claim it as proven.
6) Determinism under reserved probes: You must explicitly list that in probe mode (under Q_j) no ERR/⊥ or alternative plumbing pairs are allowed adjacent to probe states, and that Head_j can only move over a pre-laid corridor that necessarily reaches the port zone. Otherwise, hidden alternative completions could break E(a⋆)[Q_j]=u_j.
7) Seam wiring locality: State explicitly that EDGE/Eq live in the neighbor on the right of S2 (and/or the left of S1), and that the forbidden pairs are between S2 and this neighbor (e.g., forbid (EDGE=1, ForwardedColor=Color(S2)), require (Eq=1 ⇒ ForwardedColor=Color(S2))). Avoid using S–S pairs to carry EDGE/Eq information.
8) Budgeting: When using O(B) Addr values and O(B) probe states (and possibly O(B) boundary symbols Q_j), confirm the combined blow-up fits β with a concrete constant factor. All reports assert this; a short symbol count would remove doubt.

What is worthy to keep and what to postpone
- Keep: the TS probe lemma blueprint (Option A with address track), seam tableau with EDGE and Eq gating, and the refined color gating policy (colors allowed per-side; seam active only if both sides canonical; must-color only in active-active pairs). Alphabet and radius bookkeeping is consistent. These are solid directions.
- Postpone from output.md: any claimed theorem that depends on unspecified pumping/replacement lemmas, or on informal “dead-end”/“unique continuation” without enumerated local rules. Keep them in notes for now.

Concrete next steps (auditable deliverables)
1) Probe rules table (B-parameterized): enumerate the allowed Cout–out pairs for Start_j, Head_j, Test_j, Accept_j; the PORT zone adjacency enforcing Addr monotonicity; the Cin–out mask tying RID to Σ_in when Role=PORT; and the explicit rule that probe-mode forbids ERR/⊥.
2) S gating rules: define the per-side handshake tokens adjacent to S that (i) enable color at that S, (ii) do not depend on the opposite side, and (iii) trigger “active seam” only when both sides present handshakes. Add explicit pairs for mixed pairs to accept unconditionally.
3) Seam tableau snippet: specify the row alphabet and the final cell next to S2 that carries (EDGE,Eq,ForwardedColor(S1)). List the constant-size forbidden/allowed pairs between S2 and this neighbor.
4) B=2 instance: provide concrete Σ_out symbols and Cin–out,Cout–out entries so the O(kβ^2) DP can verify (i) E_{L(u)}(a⋆)[Q_1,Q_2]=(u_1,u_2), and (ii) seam acceptance rules for all 16 ordered pairs (L(u),R(v)).
5) Either add a self-contained pumping/replacement lemma to output.md (with proof) or rephrase the construction to directly build contexts of the two target lengths while preserving the local shape near S.
