  "feedback_md": "Overall: strong convergence on the key fixes (forbid \u22a5 at S on active seams; occurrence-only clause palette; sign bound to RUN; exclusivity of Eq/Neq). The remaining work is to make these radius-1 and type-local with explicit tiles and to remove a couple of inconsistencies. The hybrid direction (P02\u2019s seam/handshake plus P01\u2019s nearest-block barriers) is the most robust.\n\n| Claim (short) | Status [OK/Unclear/Broken] | Why |\n| Forbid \u22a5 at S on active seams | Unclear | All three outline local handshakes (Offer/NoOffer or activation codes), but no explicit seam tables are given; P01 also mixes S palettes across sides. Need exact Cout\u2013out matrices and side-specific S palettes. |\n| Eq/Neq exclusivity | OK | Each prover gives a radius-1 scheme (eq_so_far or per-bit tiles) where Eq succeeds iff RID=ip and Neq iff RID\u2260ip, with mutual exclusion via gating. Missing only the pointer-integrity tiles. |\n| F2 via nearest-block barriers | Unclear | P01\u2019s \u201cbarrier\u201d story is plausible but uninstantiated; P03\u2019s \u201cRepeatPAD-in-repeats-only\u201d risks leaking into bridges unless tied to local barrier tokens. Need explicit barrier tokens and a proof cursors cannot cross. |\n\nPer-prover audit and minimal fixes/counterexamples:\n- Prover 01: The activation via input code 10/01 is fine in spirit, but two issues: (i) S palette inconsistency: you use \u03a3S={\u22a5,O1,O2,O3} yet later require the \u201cleft S color\u201d to be VT/VF. Fix by splitting S into two nodes/palettes: S1\u2208{VT,VF,\u22a5} on the variable side and S2\u2208{O1,O2,O3,\u22a5} on the clause side (as in P02/P03). (ii) Radius-1 gating that depends on pred(uL).in needs a locally available witness for that input bit. Without a rule that replicates predecessor input onto uL (or a local input-output constraint that can read neighbor\u2019s input), your Cin\u2013out gate cannot enforce the 10/01 codes. Minimal lemma: add a one-step input-forwarding track that copies each node\u2019s input bit to its right neighbor\u2019s output; then uL can see both bits with r=1. Your F2/barrier story is promising; please list the exact barrier tokens and show witness cursors cannot cross them.\n- Prover 02: The Offer/NoOffer seam grammar and occurrence-only S2 palette cleanly forbid \u22a5 at active seams and force CertStart. The Eq/Neq witness with pointer integrity is standard; just instantiate the tiles tying HotRID\u2194RIDbits and Selected(ip)\u2194RUN. Two cautions: (i) Avoid the \u201ctester clause j*\u201d unless you can prove it stays neutral in F1; an active j* will add constraints across all Var_i and can break completeness. Prefer to derive type separation from clauses produced by C (or via internal boundary-extendibility masks that do not introduce new active types). (ii) Your question about hardness: yes, mapping SAT(C) to a dichotomy {\u0398(log* n), \u0398(n)} is sufficient to prove NEXPTIME-hardness of the three-way classifier (it must still choose among three labels).\n- Prover 03: Your eq_so_far register and mismatch token formalize exclusivity nicely. The RepeatPAD idea is risky: unless RepeatPAD is tied to barrier symbols that are guaranteed to be present strictly beyond the nearest blocks, it can accidentally appear in bridges and trivialize F1. Prefer P01\u2019s barrier-only approach: nearest blocks interact with S; all others are separated by a locally-detectable barrier that blocks cursors. Also, the tester j* has the same neutrality pitfall as above. Occurrence-only palette {O1,O2,O3} with sign read from RUN is indeed preferred.\n\nNext most valuable artifacts to raise confidence: (1) explicit seam tables (offers, \u22a5-forbiddance, CertStart, CAP/PAD gating); (2) the bit-comparator and pointer-integrity tiles; (3) barrier tokens and a 1\u20132 step proof that cursors die at barriers; (4) a B=2 worked DP trace showing one ON (CAP) and one OFF (PAD) case; (5) a short formal for F2: adding copies of w to the left/right does not change boundary extendibility because only nearest blocks expose Offer and accept CertStart.\n",
  "summary_md": "- Converging design: Adopt P02\u2019s Offer/NoOffer seam with two S-side palettes (S1\u2208{VT,VF,\u22a5}, S2\u2208{O1,O2,O3,\u22a5}), and P01\u2019s nearest-block barrier so F2 is automatic without trivializing F1.\n- Fix P01\u2019s S-palette inconsistency and ensure activation codes are truly radius-1 by locally forwarding predecessor input bits.\n- Exclusivity (Eq vs Neq) is sound in concept across all reports; instantiate pointer-integrity tiles to preclude spoofed bits and start-state branching.\n- Forbid \u22a5 at S on active contexts: needs explicit Cout\u2013out seam tables enumerating allowed pairs and CertStart/CAP/PAD conduits; current text is high-level only.\n- F2: Prefer \u201cbarriers stop cursors one block away from S\u201d over P03\u2019s RepeatPAD-in-repeats; prove cursors cannot cross barriers and repeated blocks tile independently.\n- Avoid adding a tester clause j*: it risks adding non-neutral constraints to F1. Seek type separation via clauses from C or internal extendibility distinctions.\n- Provide a B=2 explicit DP trace (~12 nodes) for one ON and one OFF pair to sanity-check all seam interactions and sign gating.\n- Yes: mapping SAT(C) to a dichotomy {\u0398(log* n), \u0398(n)} is sufficient for hardness of the 3-way classifier; O(1) need not be realized by this family.\n",
