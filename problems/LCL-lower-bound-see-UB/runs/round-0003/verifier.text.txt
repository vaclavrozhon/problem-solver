{"feedback_md":"High-level assessment\n- All four reports converge on a coherent strategy: (i) construct exponentially many vertex-context types via a uniform, radius-1 per-bit probe family {Q_j}; (ii) gate colors at S to canonical vertex blocks; (iii) implement a seam tableau that computes D(u,v) and enforces inequality on edges; (iv) neutralize (F2) by a global ⊥-plumbing. Prover 02 additionally proposes an Eq(u,v) gate to force consistency across left/right copies of the same vertex.\n\nStrengths and correctness\n- The per-bit probe idea is sound in our static LCL model: reserving O(B) boundary-output 4-tuples and O(B) probe-head states Head_j allows radius-1, globally uniform constraints that force a unique “probe mode” continuation, walking to the unique Addr=j cell and accepting iff RID[j]=1 (RID tied to Σ_in by Cin–out). This yields E_{L(u)}(a⋆)[Q_j]=u_j for a fixed boundary input a⋆, hence 2^B distinct left-types; symmetric on the right. Alphabet/radius bookkeeping is consistent (β=poly(s), β≥Ω(B)).\n- The seam tableau concept is standard: a row-by-row 1D simulation across the bridge that reads enc(D), u, v and emits EDGE (and optionally Eq). Enforcing “EDGE=1 ⇒ colors differ” via radius-1 checks between S and its near neighbor is feasible, as is adding “Eq=1 ⇒ colors equal.” Disabling error-chains in active modes prevents spurious accepting completions.\n\nGaps, risks, and needed corrections\n1) Color gating vs mixed pairs: Some text (esp. Prover 02) suggests that if one side is inactive and the other side is colored, the pair dead-ends. That would make any f that colors canonical types infeasible, because mixed (active, inactive) pairs are unavoidable in F1. The fix: allow color on a canonical side regardless of the opposite side; make the seam “active” only if both sides are canonical (both handshakes present). Mixed pairs must accept unconditionally (with the inactive side carrying ⊥ by gating), so f can color canonical types and map inactive types to ⊥ without violating F1.\n2) Must-color policy: If both sides are canonical, we may enforce “must color” (both S nodes non-⊥) to prevent trivial satisfactions; but this must not leak to mixed pairs. Clarify this locality in the rules: “must-color” triggers only when both handshakes are present.\n3) S-symbol control by f: Ensure the only component of the S output chosen by f is the color/⊥ token; any auxiliary phase/handshake bits at S must be fixed by local adjacency with the internal neighbors, not by f. Otherwise f would need to be context-aware.\n4) Eq gating is a helpful addition (Prover 02): it forces consistency across duplicates by making (L(u),R(u)) acceptance contingent on color equality. This avoids having to prove uniqueness of the canonical type per u. Please incorporate Eq into the seam policy: accept iff (EDGE=0 or colors differ) and (Eq=0 or colors equal), with “must-color” only in active-active pairs.\n5) Length normalization: Several proofs appeal to pumping/replacement lemmas to place W_L(u),W_R(v) adjacent to S at lengths ℓ_pump or ℓ_pump+1. We have not formalized these lemmas in output.md; until they are provided (or we give a direct construction), the existence of canonical contexts at the prescribed lengths remains an assumption. Move this to notes; do not claim it as proven.\n6) Determinism under reserved probes: You must explicitly list that in probe mode (under Q_j) no ERR/⊥ or alternative plumbing pairs are allowed adjacent to probe states, and that Head_j can only move over a pre-laid corridor that necessarily reaches the port zone. Otherwise, hidden alternative completions could break E(a⋆)[Q_j]=u_j.\n7) Seam wiring locality: State explicitly that EDGE/Eq live in the neighbor on the right of S2 (and/or the left of S1), and that the forbidden pairs are between S2 and this neighbor (e.g., forbid (EDGE=1, ForwardedColor=Color(S2)), require (Eq=1 ⇒ ForwardedColor=Color(S2))). Avoid using S–S pairs to carry EDGE/Eq information.\n8) Budgeting: When using O(B) Addr values and O(B) probe states (and possibly O(B) boundary symbols Q_j), confirm the combined blow-up fits β with a concrete constant factor. All reports assert this; a short symbol count would remove doubt.\n\nWhat is worthy to keep and what to postpone\n- Keep: the TS probe lemma blueprint (Option A with address track), seam tableau with EDGE and Eq gating, and the refined color gating policy (colors allowed per-side; seam active only if both sides canonical; must-color only in active-active pairs). Alphabet and radius bookkeeping is consistent. These are solid directions.\n- Postpone from output.md: any claimed theorem that depends on unspecified pumping/replacement lemmas, or on informal “dead-end”/“unique continuation” without enumerated local rules. Keep them in notes for now.\n\nConcrete next steps (auditable deliverables)\n1) Probe rules table (B-parameterized): enumerate the allowed Cout–out pairs for Start_j, Head_j, Test_j, Accept_j; the PORT zone adjacency enforcing Addr monotonicity; the Cin–out mask tying RID to Σ_in when Role=PORT; and the explicit rule that probe-mode forbids ERR/⊥.\n2) S gating rules: define the per-side handshake tokens adjacent to S that (i) enable color at that S, (ii) do not depend on the opposite side, and (iii) trigger “active seam” only when both sides present handshakes. Add explicit pairs for mixed pairs to accept unconditionally.\n3) Seam tableau snippet: specify the row alphabet and the final cell next to S2 that carries (EDGE,Eq,ForwardedColor(S1)). List the constant-size forbidden/allowed pairs between S2 and this neighbor.\n4) B=2 instance: provide concrete Σ_out symbols and Cin–out,Cout–out entries so the O(kβ^2) DP can verify (i) E_{L(u)}(a⋆)[Q_1,Q_2]=(u_1,u_2), and (ii) seam acceptance rules for all 16 ordered pairs (L(u),R(v)).\n5) Either add a self-contained pumping/replacement lemma to output.md (with proof) or rephrase the construction to directly build contexts of the two target lengths while preserving the local shape near S.\n","new_notes_md":"Consolidated plan and corrections for the S3Col → F1 reduction (radius 1, β-normalized)\n\nParameters and model\n- Input: succinct graph on V={0,1}^B specified by circuit D of size s. Choose β=s^{c1} with c1≥c0 so β≥Θ(B) and there is symbol budget for O(B) auxiliary symbols. All constraints are radius 1 via Cin–out and Cout–out.\n\nCanonical vertex blocks and activity\n- Left canonical block W_L(u) adjacent to S exposes a port zone of length B with two subtracks: Addr∈{1,…,B} and RID∈{0,1}. Local rules enforce Addr increases by 1 left→right and Cin–out ties RID to Σ_in. The B-bit word u is RID[1..B]. Right canonical block W_R(v) is symmetric.\n- Per-side color gating (corrected): S may carry a color token {R,G,B} on a side iff the adjacent interior begins with a well-formed canonical vertex header (per-side handshake). This decision is per-side and does not depend on the opposite side. If the header is absent or malformed, the only allowed S token on that side is ⊥.\n- Seam activation: The seam gadget is “active” only when both sides are canonical (both per-side handshakes present). Mixed pairs (only one side canonical) are “semi-active” and must accept unconditionally (see below), so that f may color canonical types without violating F1 on mixed pairs.\n\nType separation via per-bit probes (Option A)\n- Reserve B distinct boundary-output 4-tuples {Q_j}. Under boundary inputs a⋆ and outputs Q_j, Cout–out forces a deterministic probe mode starting at the boundary, carrying a tagged head Head_j that moves along a pre-laid corridor to the unique cell in the port zone with Addr=j. At that cell, continuation exists iff RID=1. While in probe mode, error/⊥ symbols are forbidden from appearing adjacent to probe states; outside reserved probes, standard error/⊥ plumbing is allowed.\n- Claim (TS): For any canonical left vertex word L(u), E_{L(u)}(a⋆)[Q_j]=u_j. Hence u≠u′ ⇒ Type(L(u))≠Type(L(u′)). Symmetric on the right. This uses only radius-1 locality and O(B) symbol budget.\n\nSeam tableau and acceptance\n- Active seam (both sides canonical): The bridge wb∘wc hosts a row-by-row tableau of a fixed TM U computing EDGE:=D(u,v) and Eq:=[u=v] in poly(s) steps. The last row writes (EDGE,Eq,ForwardedColor(S1)) into the cell immediately to the right of S2. Local rules between S2 and this neighbor enforce simultaneously:\n  (A) if EDGE=1 then Color(S2)≠ForwardedColor(S1) (inequality on edges), else vacuous; and\n  (B) if Eq=1 then Color(S2)=ForwardedColor(S1) (same-vertex consistency), else vacuous.\n  Additionally, a must-color rule is enforced only in this active-active case: both S sides must be non-⊥.\n- Semi-active seam (mixed pair): If exactly one side is canonical, the colored side is allowed (by per-side gating), the opposite side must be ⊥, and the seam does not activate; the pair must accept unconditionally (neutral plumbing fills the interior). This prevents mixed pairs from constraining f.\n- Inactive seam (neither side canonical): Both sides must be ⊥ and the pair accepts (neutral plumbing).\n\nF2 neutralization\n- A global ⊥-filler is available on repetitions w^z, z≥1, independent of boundary outputs and inputs, and does not interfere with per-side gating or the active seam. Thus (F2) becomes trivial.\n\nExistence/length normalization (to be formalized)\n- We assume (to be proven or replaced by an explicit construction) that for each u there exists at least one left (resp. right) canonical context of length ℓ∈{ℓ_pump,ℓ_pump+1} with the port zone adjacent to S. Padding occurs outside the port zone, so probes and seam interfaces are unaffected. This step currently rests on pumping/replacement lemmas not yet included in output.md; keep it here as an assumption until proven.\n\nBudget and locality checklist\n- Alphabet: O(1) for roles/phases, colors+⊥, error alphabet, tableau alphabet; O(B) for Addr; O(B) for probe heads and reserved boundary outputs. Choose β accordingly. All constraints are radius 1 and refer only to adjacent outputs (S↔S neighbor or S↔interior neighbor).\n\nAudit points to pin down next\n- Explicit tables for probe-mode transitions and the prohibition of ERR/⊥ near probe states.\n- Exact per-side handshake symbols, and the three seam modes (inactive, semi-active, active) encoded locally.\n- The seam’s final cell format and the constant-size forbidden/allowed adjacency list realizing (A) and (B) above.\n- A B=2 explicit instance for DP validation.\n","new_notes_append":"True","new_outputs_md":"","new_outputs_append":"True","verdict":"partial success"}
