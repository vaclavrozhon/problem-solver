The document is self-contained and includes:\\n\\\\begin{enumerate}[nosep]\\n\\\\item explicit left/right seam adjacency tables (Cout–out) that combine neighbour \\\"roles\\\" with the two S-side palettes and the certificate conduit alphabet $\\\\{\\\\botSym,\\\\CertStart,\\\\CAP,\\\\PAD\\\\}$; the tables enforce the constraints required in the notes (no $\\\\botSym$ under Offer, CertStart forced except when an allowed CAP/PAD is locally witnessed, CAP only after Eq and sign match, PAD only after Neq, no CAP/PAD leakage);\\n\\\\item a unified naming of the S-palettes: S1$=\\\\{\\\\VT,\\\\VF,\\\\botSym\\\\}$ and S2$=\\\\{\\\\Oone,\\\\Otwo,\\\\Othree,\\\\botSym\\\\}$;\\n\\\\item explicit radius-1 comparator tiles (per-bit) and pointer-integrity tiles (HotRID$\\\\leftrightarrow$RIDbits), RUN exposure conventions for Occ[1..3] and sgn[1..3], the Selected gating by S2, and an inductive exclusivity lemma that Eq and Neq cannot both accept;\\n\\\\item a list of barrier tokens and the local rules that forbid cursor/witness tokens from crossing them, plus a short proof (locality/F2) that repeating a module separated by barriers adds only isolated, self-satisfying structure;\\n\\\\item a one-step input-forwarding track for input-coded activation (radius-1 availability); and\\n\\\\item a worked B=2 example (two 12-node patches) showing an ON case (CAP with sign match) and an OFF case (PAD after mismatch), with exact tokens on each track and a demonstration where illegal attempts would be locally rejected.\\n\\\\end{enumerate}\\n\\\\end{abstract}\\n\\n\\\\section{Model, notation, and general conventions}\\nWe work with a finite alphabet of local symbols placed on nodes and on (or associated with) directed edges of the underlying (planar or graph) substrate. All local rules are radius--1 (they constrain a node together with its immediate neighbours and the labels on the incident half-edges). Equivalently we may view the system as a (labelled) graph where every radius--1 neighbourhood must belong to a prescribed finite set of allowed patterns. The statements below specify these patterns as allowed pairs/triples on adjacent positions (edges and incident vertices), which is standard and equivalent to a list of Wang-type tiles for a planar embedding.\\n\\nWe use the following dedicated tracks (each track is an orthogonal channel of symbols; a physical tile carries a symbol for each track):\\n\\\\begin{itemize}[nosep]\\n\\\\item OfferTrack at a neighbour site: values $\\\\{\\\\Offer,\\\\NoOffer,\\\\Neutral\\\\}$ (short: Offer/NoOffer/Neutral). A node that is \\\"offering\\\" an anchor emits Offer on the appropriate incident seam edge.\\n\\\\item S1Track (the variable side of the seam): alphabet $\\\\mathcal S_1 = \\\\{\\\\VT,\\\\VF,\\\\botSym\\\\}$.\\n\\\\item S2Track (the clause/occurrence side of the seam): alphabet $\\\\mathcal S_2 = \\\\{\\\\Oone,\\\\Otwo,\\\\Othree,\\\\botSym\\\\}$.\\n\\\\item CertTrack (the seam conduit / certificate-out track on the seam edge): alphabet $\\\\{\\\\botSym,\\\\CertStart,\\\\CAP,\\\\PAD\\\\}$. Symbol $\\\\botSym$ means \\\"no certificate symbols present here\\\"; $\\\\CertStart$ is the idle certificate token forced initially when an offer is present but no certificate was accepted; $\\\\CAP$/ $\\\\PAD$ denote the two certificate outcomes (accept/positive certificate, or a padding/certificate for OFF).\\n\\\\item RID tracks: an integer RID is represented as a length-$B$ binary string (bit indices $1\\\\ldots B$). For generality we describe for arbitrary $B$ and later give $B=2$ example. The track HotRID carries a token $\\\\HotRID(r)$ when a node is the \\\"hot\\\" token advertising RID $r$; on other nodes HotRID is $\\\\botSym$. The track RIDbit$_i$ (for $i=1,\\\\dots,B$) carries the bit 0 or 1 for the $i$-th position. We write the RIDbit alphabet as $\\\\{0,1\\\\}$ (we assume the geometry supports putting the bits in the positions the comparator tiles expect).\\n\\\\item Comparator tracks: each comparator tile position carries two local boolean flags: eq_so_far (values $1$ or $0$) and mismatch_flag (values $0$ or $1$). The precise per-bit transition rules are given below.\\n\\\\item RUN exposure tracks: for a clause RUN we require that three occurrence-exposure tracks Occ[1],Occ[2],Occ[3] carry bits in $\\\\{0,1\\\\}$ and the three sign tracks sgn[1],sgn[2],sgn[3] carry signs from $\\\\{+, -\\\\}$ (we will use $+$ to mean the literal is positive, and $-$ to mean negated literal).\\n\\\\item Selected tracks at the seam: Selected(k) is a boolean marker (present/absent) indicating that the gate has chosen occurrence $k$ (for $k=1,2,3$); SelectedSgn is the sign of that selected occurrence, copied from the RUN.\\n\\\\item Barrier tokens: a finite set of barrier tokens (we use \\\\BR for a barrier marker placed exactly one node beyond the nearest block footer). The barrier alphabet is described below.\\n\\\\item Witness/cursor tokens: track symbols used by witness-reading machinery (a small finite set $\\\\W$). The local rules below will forbid adjacency between any $w\\\\in\\\\W$ and a barrier tile.\\n\\\\end{itemize}\\n\\nRemark. The concrete geometry of where bits and comparator cells sit is left explicit in the B=2 patch (Section~\\\\ref{sec:B2}). The general local rules are given so that they constrain only radius--1 neighbourhoods.\\n\\n\\\\section{S palettes (unified terminology)\\\\label{sec:Spalettes}}\\nWe fix the S palettes globally and use these names throughout the document.\\n\\\\begin{definition}[S palettes]\\nThe two S palettes are\\n\\\\[\\\\mathcal S_1 = \\\\{\\\\VT,\\\\VF,\\\\botSym\\\\},\\\\qquad \\\\mathcal S_2=\\\\{\\\\Oone,\\\\Otwo,\\\\Othree,\\\\botSym\\\\}.\\n\\\\]\\nHere $\\\\VT$ (``variable true'') and $\\\\VF$ (``variable false'') record the local assignment read at the variable side; the clause side records occurrence index $\\\\Oone,\\\\Otwo,\\\\Othree$ (or $\\\\botSym$ when inactive).\\n\\\\end{definition}\\n\\nWe adopt the global policy (enforced by the seam tables below): a non-$\\\\botSym$ symbol on either S1 or S2 is allowed only when the adjacent external neighbour emits Offer on the corresponding seam edge. Conversely, when the neighbour is not offering (NoOffer or Neutral), the adjacent S track must be $\\\\botSym$. This enforces the \\\"active context excludes $\\\\botSym$\\\" requirement in the notes.\\n\\n\\\\section{Seam tables: explicit Cout–out rules}\\nWe now give explicit radius--1 local constraints for the two seam edges. Each seam edge is a pair (neighbour node) $\\\\leftrightarrow$ (seam node). In our formalisation there are two such seam edges per seam node: (left neighbour) $\\\\leftrightarrow$ S1 and S2 $\\\\leftrightarrow$ (right neighbour). The constraints are symmetric (left/right) after renaming S1/S2 appropriately; we therefore list the two tables separately and spell conditions that refer to local comparator/RUN signals.\\n\\nNotation: an allowed local pattern on a seam edge is given as a triple\\n\\\\[(\\\\text{NeighbourRole},\\\\;\\\\text{S-value},\\\\;\\\\text{CertTrack-value}),\\n\\\\]\\nwhere NeighbourRole $\\\\in\\\\{\\\\Offer,\\\\NoOffer,\\\\Neutral\\\\}$, S-value is taken from the corresponding $\\\\mathcal S_1$ or $\\\\mathcal S_2$, and CertTrack-value $\\\\in\\\\{\\\\botSym,\\\\CertStart,\\\\CAP,\\\\PAD\\\\}$. Some allowed patterns have the additional local requirement that an adjacent comparator/RUN tile exposes eq/neq acceptance or a matching sign; these side-conditions are indicated explicitly.\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Left seam: (left neighbour) $\\\\leftrightarrow$ S1}\\nAll allowed radius--1 patterns on the left seam are the disjoint union of the following.\\n\\\\begin{description}[leftmargin=1.6cm]\\n\\\\item[Inactive neighbour:] If the left neighbour emits $\\\\NoOffer$ or $\\\\Neutral$, then the only allowed S1 value is $\\\\botSym$ and the only allowed CertTrack value is $\\\\botSym$:\\n\\\\[(\\\\NoOffer,\\\\;\\\\botSym,\\\\;\\\\botSym),\\\\qquad (\\\\Neutral,\\\\;\\\\botSym,\\\\;\\\\botSym).\\n\\\\]\\nThis enforces: $\\\\botSym$ allowed only when neighbour is not offering.\\n\\\\item[Active neighbour (Offer): initial idle certificate:] If the left neighbour emits $\\\\Offer$, and S1 is non-$\\\\botSym$ (that is, S1 $\\\\in\\\\{\\\\VT,\\\\VF\\\\}$), then the seam may carry the idle certificate token $\\\\CertStart$:\\n\\\\[(\\\\Offer,\\\\;\\\\VT,\\\\;\\\\CertStart),\\\\qquad (\\\\Offer,\\\\;\\\\VF,\\\\;\\\\CertStart).\\n\\\\]\\nThe intended reading is: in the absence of an accepted certificate, the seam conduit holds $\\\\CertStart$ to show an anchored well-formed block.\\n\\\\item[Active neighbour (Offer): CAP allowed only after Eq + sign match:] Still under the assumption that the left neighbour emits $\\\\Offer$ and S1 $\\\\in\\\\{\\\\VT,\\\\VF\\\\}$, the seam may instead carry $\\\\CAP$ if and only if the immediate comparator tile adjacent to this seam edge exposes an \\\\emph{Eq-accept} bit and furthermore the SelectedSgn (copied from the adjacent RUN) matches the S1 assignment. Formally the allowed triple is:\\n\\\\[\\n(\\\\Offer,\\\\; s,\\\\; \\\\CAP)\\\\quad\\\\text{is allowed iff the adjacent comparator end exposes }\\\\Eq=1\\\\text{ and }\\\\SelectedSgn = \\\\sigma(s),\\n\\\\]\\nwhere $s\\\\in\\\\{\\\\VT,\\\\VF\\\\}$ and we define the sign function $\\\\sigma$ by $\\\\sigma(\\\\VT)=+,$ $\\\\sigma(\\\\VF)=-$ (so the variable-side token $\\\\VT$ matches a positive sign $+$). The local check is radius--1 because the comparator end and the SelectedSgn are placed at adjacent nodes; hence the condition is locally testable.\\n\\\\item[Active neighbour (Offer): PAD allowed only after Neq acceptance:] Under $\\\\Offer$ and S1 $\\\\in\\\\{\\\\VT,\\\\VF\\\\}$, the seam may instead carry $\\\\PAD$ if and only if the adjacent comparator end exposes a Neq-accept marker (i.e. a mismatch has been detected within the locally visible comparator chain). Formally:\\n\\\\[\\n(\\\\Offer,\\\\; s,\\\\; \\\\PAD)\\\\quad\\\\text{is allowed iff the adjacent comparator end exposes }\\\\Neq=1.\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\end{description}\\n\\nNo other triples are allowed on the left seam. In particular $\\\\botSym$ is forbidden when the neighbour emits $\\\\Offer$, and $\\\\CAP$/$\\\\PAD$ cannot appear unless the indicated local acceptance markers are present: this prohibits CAP/PAD leakage in the sense required.\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Right seam: S2 $\\\\leftrightarrow$ (right neighbour)}\\nThe right seam is symmetric but uses the $\\\\mathcal S_2$ palette and selection gating by occurrence index. The allowed patterns are:\\n\\\\begin{description}[leftmargin=1.6cm]\\n\\\\item[Inactive neighbour:] If the right neighbour emits $\\\\NoOffer$ or $\\\\Neutral$, then S2 must be $\\\\botSym$ and CertTrack must be $\\\\botSym$:\\n\\\\[(\\\\NoOffer,\\\\;\\\\botSym,\\\\;\\\\botSym),\\\\qquad (\\\\Neutral,\\\\;\\\\botSym,\\\\;\\\\botSym).\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\item[Active neighbour (Offer): idle certificate:] If the right neighbour emits $\\\\Offer$ and S2 $\\\\in\\\\{\\\\Oone,\\\\Otwo,\\\\Othree\\\\}$, then the seam may carry $\\\\CertStart$:\\n\\\\[(\\\\Offer,\\\\;\\\\Oone,\\\\;\\\\CertStart),\\\\quad(\\\\Offer,\\\\;\\\\Otwo,\\\\;\\\\CertStart),\\\\quad(\\\\Offer,\\\\;\\\\Othree,\\\\;\\\\CertStart).\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\item[Active neighbour (Offer): CAP gating by selection and sign match:] If the right neighbour emits $\\\\Offer$ and S2 $=\\\\Ok$ ($k\\\\in\\\\{1,2,3\\\\}$), then the seam may carry $\\\\CAP$ iff all of the following local conditions hold in the radius--1 neighborhood:\\n\\\\begin{enumerate}[nosep]\\n\\\\item the adjacent comparator end exposes an Eq-accept marker (Eq=1);\\n\\\\item the Selected marker is present and equals $k$ (i.e. Selected(k) is true at the local gate position); and\\n\\\\item the SelectedSgn equals the RUN's sgn[k] and furthermore SelectedSgn matches the verified assignment seen on the variable side (S1) if the S-sign is present, or else SelectedSgn is checked only against RUN when S1 only reads assignment on the left.\\n\\\\end{enumerate}\\nFormally:\\n\\\\[\\n(\\\\Offer,\\\\;\\\\Ok,\\\\;\\\\CAP)\\\\text{ allowed iff Eq=1 and Selected(k)=1 and SelectedSgn matches the RUN sgn}[k].\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\item[Active neighbour (Offer): PAD allowed after Neq acceptance:] If the right neighbour emits $\\\\Offer$ and S2 $=\\\\Ok$, then\\n\\\\[\\n(\\\\Offer,\\\\;\\\\Ok,\\\\;\\\\PAD)\\\\text{ is allowed iff the adjacent comparator end exposes Neq=1.}\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\end{description}\\n\\nNo other right-seam triples are allowed. This table ensures (i) $\\\\botSym$ forbidden when neighbour=Offer, (ii) CertStart is the default non-$\\\\botSym$ token, (iii) CAP only allowed under Eq and sign match with Selected gating, (iv) PAD only on Neq acceptance, and (v) CAP/PAD cannot appear without local acceptance signals.\\n\\n\\\\section{Comparator and pointer-integrity tiles}\\nThis section gives explicit per-bit comparator rules (the local transition rules that propagate eq_so_far/mismatch) and HotRID$\\\\leftrightarrow$RIDbit consistency rules. We treat a general bit-length $B$; later, Section~\\\\ref{sec:B2} gives the full concrete $B=2$ instantiation.\\n\\n\\\\subsection{RID encoding and HotRID}\\nFix $B\\\\ge 1$. An RID is an element of $\\\\{0,1\\\\}^B$. The HotRID track carries tokens $\\\\HotRID(r)$ for $r\\\\in\\\\{0,1\\\\}^B$; on positions that are not hot, this track is $\\\\botSym$. The RIDbit$_i$ track at the $i$-th bit position carries the bit value $0$ or $1$.\\n\\nPointer-integrity local rule (HotRID$\\\\leftrightarrow$RIDbit):\\n\\\\begin{itemize}[nosep]\\n\\\\item For any $i\\\\in\\\\{1,\\\\dots,B\\\\}$, whenever a HotRID$(r)$ token is adjacent (radius--1) to a RIDbit$_i$ position carrying bit $b$, the pair is allowed iff $b=r_i$ (the $i$-th bit of $r$). Concretely, the allowed local patterns are\\n\\\\[ (\\\\HotRID(r),\\\\;\\\\RIDbit_i=b)\\\\ \\\\text{allowed iff } b=r_i.\\\\]\\nSince this is required for every bit position incidence, any configuration containing a HotRID requires the nearby bits to agree with that pointer value.\\n\\\\end{itemize}\\nThis is a radius--1 constraint because each HotRID tile is adjacent to the RIDbit tiles that the pointer claims to address.\\n\\n\\\\subsection{RUN exposure, Selected gating, and SelectedSgn}\\nA clause RUN (the poly-length tableau inside wc referenced in the notes) is required to expose three occurrence bits and three signs in positions adjacent to the seam gate. The local rules are simple copy rules that guarantee the seam gate can read Occ[k] and sgn[k] for $k=1,2,3$ in its radius--1 neighbourhood:\\n\\\\begin{itemize}[nosep]\\n\\\\item At the RUN foot (a node adjacent to the seam gate) the tracks Occ[1],Occ[2],Occ[3] are bona fide bits $\\\\in\\\\{0,1\\\\}$ and sgn[1],sgn[2],sgn[3]\\\\in\\\\{+, -\\\\}$ and local copy rules allow SelectedSgn to be defined as a copy of sgn[k] when Selected(k) holds.\\n\\\\item The Selected(k) tile at the gate is allowed only when S2=$\\\\Ok$ (the seam clause-side equals this occurrence index); the allowed local pattern on that radius--1 neighbourhood is\\n\\\\[(\\\\text{S2}=\\\\Ok,\\\\; \\\\text{Selected}(k)=1)\\\\ \\\\text{allowed},\\\\qquad(\\\\text{S2}\\\\ne\\\\Ok,\\\\; \\\\text{Selected}(k)=1)\\\\ \\\\text{forbidden}.\\\\]\\n\\\\item SelectedSgn is allowed only if Selected(k)=1 in the same radius--1 neighbourhood; further local copy rules require SelectedSgn to equal sgn[k].\\n\\\\end{itemize}\\nThese constraints ensure the gate can read the selected occurrence and its sign locally.\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Per-bit comparator tile rules (Eq/Neq chain)}\\nLet the comparator chain occupy $B$ \\\\'positions\\\\' indexed $1\\\\ldots B$ arranged in the direction left$\\\\to$right. Each comparator position $i$ sees the two RID bits to compare for that index (one coming from the left operand, the other from the right operand), and an input flag eq_in that encodes whether all previous bits matched. The comparator tile at index $i$ then produces eq_out and possibly sets mismatch at the first differing bit.\\n\\nWe formalise the per-bit allowed local patterns as follows. The comparator tile at index $i$ has the local triple\\n\\\\[(a_i, b_i, eq_{in})\\\\quad\\\\mapsto\\\\quad (eq_{out},\\\\;mismatch_{out}),\\n\\\\]\\nwhere $a_i,b_i\\\\in\\\\{0,1\\\\}$ are the two bits being compared at index $i$, $eq_{in}\\\\in\\\\{0,1\\\\}$, and the outputs are in $\\\\{0,1\\\\}$ as well. The allowed transition table (per-bit) is:\\n\\\\begin{center}\\n\\\\begin{tabular}{llcc}\\n\\\\toprule\\n$a_i$ & $b_i$ & $eq_{in}$ & $(eq_{out},\\\\;mismatch_{out})$ \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\midrule\\n0 & 0 & 1 & $(1,0)$ \\\\\\\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & $(1,0)$ \\\\\\\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & $(0,1)$ (first mismatch here) \\\\\\\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 & $(0,1)$ (first mismatch here) \\\\\\\\\\nany & any & 0 & $(0,1)$ (propagate mismatch) \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\bottomrule\\n\\\\end{tabular}\\n\\\\end{center}\\nThe last row says: once eq_in is $0$ (a mismatch has already occurred earlier), eq_out stays $0$ and mismatch is kept at $1$ (the comparator chain remembers that a mismatch occurred earlier). For formal local rules we enforce that the triple $(a_i,b_i,eq_{in})$ appearing on the three relevant tracks adjacent to the tile must be one of the above and that the local tile also carries the corresponding $(eq_{out},mismatch_{out})$ fields on the outgoing side; since all fields are in the local neighbourhood the check is radius--1.\\n\\nThe global semantics: start with eq_in at index $1$ equal to $1$; propagate the transitions across indices $1\\\\ldots B$. At the rightmost comparator end we inspect eq_out (call this EqAccept) and mismatch_out (call this NeqAccept). The tile set above guarantees that\\n\\\\[\\\\text{EqAccept}=1\\\\IFF a_1= b_1,\\\\, a_2=b_2,\\\\,\\\\dots,\\\\, a_B=b_B,\\\\]\\nand that NeqAccept=1 iff some first mismatch was detected somewhere in the chain.\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Exclusivity lemma (Eq vs Neq)}\\nWe record the obvious but crucial exclusivity property as a short lemma and proof.\\n\\\\begin{lemma}[Exclusivity of Eq and Neq]\\nWith the comparator transition rules above, at the rightmost comparator end the two acceptance bits cannot both be $1$. Concretely, it is impossible to have EqAccept=1 and NeqAccept=1 simultaneously.\\n\\\\end{lemma}\\n\\\\begin{proof}\\nLet eq_i denote the eq flag after processing bits $1\\\\ldots i$ (so eq_0=1 by convention) and let mismatch_i denote the mismatch flag after processing bits $1\\\\ldots i$. The per-bit table makes the following deterministic step from $(eq_{i-1},mismatch_{i-1})$ and bits $(a_i,b_i)$ to $(eq_i,mismatch_i)$:\\n\\\\begin{itemize}[nosep]\\n\\\\item If $eq_{i-1}=1$ and $a_i=b_i$, then $eq_i=1,mismatch_i=0$.\\n\\\\item If $eq_{i-1}=1$ and $a_i\\\\ne b_i$, then $eq_i=0,mismatch_i=1$ (first mismatch occurs at $i$).\\n\\\\item If $eq_{i-1}=0$, then $eq_i=0,mismatch_i=1$ (mismatch persists).\\n\\\\end{itemize}\\nHence $(eq_i,mismatch_i)$ is always exactly one of $(1,0)$ or $(0,1)$; there is no transition producing $(1,1)$. In particular, at the final index $B$ we cannot have $(eq_B,mismatch_B)=(1,1)$, i.e. EqAccept and NeqAccept cannot both be $1$. This completes the proof.\\n\\\\end{proof}\\n\\nRemark. The lemma is purely local (it follows by deterministic per-bit transitions); this is the radius--1 gate exclusivity required.\\n\\n\\\\section{Barrier tokens and F2 locality proof}\\n\\\\subsection{Barrier tokens (list and local rules)}\\nWe use a single barrier token type $\\\\BR$ (we can label it directionally if desired as $\\\\BR_{left}$ or $\\\\BR_{right}$ but a single undirected barrier placed one node beyond the nearest block footer suffices). Barriers are placed deterministically at the unique position \\\"one node beyond each RUN/footer block\\\"; this placement is enforced elsewhere in the overall tiling setup (we assume the infrastructure that places nearest-block markers ensures the barrier positions are recognisable by local conditions). The properties we impose by local rules are:\\n\\\\begin{enumerate}[nosep]\\n\\\\item No witness or cursor token may be adjacent to a barrier: for every witness type symbol $w\\\\in\\\\W$ and every radius--1 neighbourhood that contains $(\\\\BR,w)$ as adjacent tokens the pattern is forbidden. Concretely, the allowed local patterns forbid labelled pairs $(\\\\BR, w)$ on any incident half-edge.\\n\\\\item No certificate conduit token is allowed to cross the barrier: if the seam conduit would put a $\\\\CAP$ or $\\\\PAD$ on an edge that crosses a barrier position, the local check forbids it; equivalently, barriers are required to carry $\\\\botSym$ certificate conduit on edges incident across the barrier.\\n\\\\item Barrier is adjacent to the block footer position: the footer node (part of the nearest block) and the barrier node are adjacent and that adjacency is local and constrained; barrier tokens are therefore one step beyond the block footer in graph distance.\\n\\\\end{enumerate}\\nThese local rules are radius--1 conditions that disallow any token in $\\\\W$ from being adjacent to $\\\\BR$ or across the barrier edge.\\n\\n\\\\subsection{F2 locality proof: repeated module separation by barriers}\\nProposition (informal F2 statement made formal). Let $M$ be a finite local module (a well-formed anchor/window block) that is valid under the local rules and whose immediate exterior contains a barrier $\\\\BR$ at each module boundary (precisely one barrier per nearest-block boundary placed one node beyond each module). Then any juxtaposition of several copies of $M$ separated by barriers produces a valid global configuration: the barriers prevent any radius--1 constraint from depending on data from different modules.\\n\\n\\\\begin{proof}\\nAll local constraints are radius--1 and refer only to a node and its immediate neighbours. Suppose two module copies $M_1$ and $M_2$ are separated by a barrier node $b$. Any radius--1 neighbourhood that intersects $M_1$ and $M_2$ simultaneously would have to contain nodes from both sides of the barrier and hence include the barrier node $b$ in the intersection. But the local rules forbidding adjacency of witness/cursor tokens to $\\\\BR$ and forbidding certificate conduit across $\\\\BR$ block any pattern that would have connected the two modules: at the barrier the only allowed patterns are those that do not carry any witness/cursor or CAP/PAD conduits across. Therefore every allowed radius--1 neighbourhood that contains nodes from $M_1$ is fully contained in the union $M_1\\\\cup\\\\{b\\\\}$, and likewise for $M_2$. Coupling this with the fact that $M_1$ and $M_2$ individually satisfy all radius--1 constraints within themselves and with the barrier $b$, the union $M_1\\\\cup\\\\{b\\\\}\\\\cup M_2$ satisfies all constraints. Inductively, repeating this argument for any finite sequence of modules separated by barriers shows the whole repeated structure is valid.\\n\\nThus barriers ensure strict locality (modules cannot affect each other across barriers), which is the F2 property required.\\n\\\\end{proof}\\n\\n\\\\section{Input-forwarding track (one-step activation)}\\nIf the implementation uses input-coded activation (pred(uL).in and pred(vR).in are needed at uL and vR locally), then we add a dedicated track InFwd that forwards the predecessor input one step so that it is locally available at the site where the seam gate reads it. The local rule is the simple copy rule:\\n\\\\[\\n(\\\\text{pred}(uL).\\\\mathrm{in}=b,\\\\;\\\\text{InFwd}(uL)=b)\\\\ \\\\text{is allowed},\\n\\\\]\\nand conversely forbids mismatches. This is a radius--1 condition (the pred(uL) node is adjacent to uL). With this one-step forwarding the seam gate can locally inspect the predecessor input without non-local references.\\n\\nIf one prefers not to use input-coded activation, then the gate constraints must be stated without reference to the predecessor input; the tables above do not require predecessor input except when explicitly used — the InFwd track is optional depending on the broader implementation.\\n\\n\\\\section{B=2 worked example: a 12-node patch around a seam S\\\\label{sec:B2}}\\nWe now provide a fully explicit worked example for $B=2$. The patch comprises two examples, each a small radius--1 neighbourhood consisting of 12 labelled nodes with explicit adjacency. Each node carries the set of tracks described earlier; in the tables below we list only the nontrivial tracks (tracks that are not $\\\\botSym$ on that node). The adjacency graph $G_{\\\\mathrm{patch}}=(V,E)$ for each patch is a simple path of length 11 (12 nodes) with nodes $v_1,\\\\dots,v_{12}$ and edges $(v_i,v_{i+1})$ for $i=1,\\\\dots,11$. This linear embedding suffices to make all required radius--1 checks local in the patch (the comparator cells are placed so that they can inspect the adjacent RIDbit nodes as described below). We place the seam S at node $v_7$ so that left seam is $(v_6\\\\leftrightarrow v_7)$ and right seam is $(v_7\\\\leftrightarrow v_8)$; the comparator chain runs through nodes $v_4,v_5,v_6$ (bits and comparators are arranged so that the local rules of Section~3 are testable on the path). The barrier tokens appear at $v_1$ and $v_{12}$.\\n\\nWe will give the two cases in parallel: Case A (ON, CAP) and Case B (OFF, PAD). For both cases we set $B=2$ and index bits as $(i=1)$ MSB, $(i=2)$ LSB. We list the relevant per-node tracks: HotRID (if present), RIDbit$_1$, RIDbit$_2$, comparator flags (eq_so_far/mismatch) at comparator tiles, OfferTrack at $v_6$ (left neighbour) and $v_8$ (right neighbour), S1 and S2 at $v_7$, CertTrack on the two seam edges (we record left-seam value on the $(v_6,v_7)$ edge and right-seam value on $(v_7,v_8)$), RUN exposure Occ[1..3] and sgn[1..3] (we place these at $v_9$ adjacent to the right seam to be locally accessible), Selected markers near the right seam.\\n\\nConventions for the patch: the nodes and their principal contents are the following (we display only non-$\\\\botSym$ track entries):\\n\\n\\\\subsection*{Case A (ON): CAP, sign match, RIDs equal}\\nWe set the RIDs on the left and right to be equal: $r_{L}=r_{R}=(1,0)$ (MSB=1, LSB=0). The comparator chain must therefore produce EqAccept=1 at the right end. We select occurrence $k=1$ and arrange RUN to expose Occ[1]=1 and sgn[1]=+. We set S1=\\\\VT so that the S1 assignment matches the selected sign (+), allowing CAP.

The chain starts with eq_in=1 at $v_5$ and both pairs match (1 vs 1, then 0 vs 0) so at the right end we have EqAccept=1 and NeqAccept=0.\\n\\\\item The right RUN at $v_9$ exposes Occ[1]=1 and sgn[1]=$+$; Selected is present at $v_7$ because S2=$\\\\Oone$ and S1=$\\\\VT$; SelectedSgn=$+$ equals sgn[1]. The local seam rule allows $\\\\CAP$ on both left and right seam edges because EqAccept=1 and the sign matches the seam-side assignment.\\n\\\\item Barriers at $v_1,v_{12}$ are isolated and no witness tokens are adjacent to them.\\n\\\\end{itemize}\\nThus Case~A provides a valid ON instance with $\\\\CAP$ presented on the seam edges.\\n\\n\\\\subsection*{Case B (OFF): PAD, first-bit mismatch}\\nWe now demonstrate an OFF instance where the RIDs differ and the comparator sees a mismatch at the MSB; this causes NeqAccept=1 and permits $\\\\PAD$ on the seams. We set the left RID to $(1,0)$ and the right RID to $(1,1)$ so they differ in LSB (or choose a mismatch at MSB; here we pick LSB mismatch for variety). We also set S2=$\\\\Otwo$ selecting occurrence 2, and RUN reports Occ[2]=0 (or Occ[2]=1 but the RID mismatch causes PAD to be used regardless for the gate).

Thus EqAccept=0 and NeqAccept=1.\\n\\\\item By the seam table, when the local comparator end exposes Neq=1 the seam is allowed to carry $\\\\PAD$; hence both left and right seam edges carry $\\\\PAD$ as shown. Note that $\\\\CAP$ is forbidden because Eq=0.\\n\\\\item Selected(2)=1 and SelectedSgn=$-$ are consistent with S2=$\\\\Otwo$ and with the RUN sgn[2]=$-$.\\n\\\\item Barriers are present and no witness tokens cross them.\\n\\\\end{itemize}\\n\\n\\\\subsection*{Where illegal attempts get stuck}\\nWe indicate two examples of illegal attempts and show the local point of rejection (a radius--1 violation):\\n\\\\begin{enumerate}[nosep]\\n\\\\item Attempt to place $\\\\CAP$ in Case~B despite Neq (i.e. an adversary tries to put $\\\\CAP$ at $(v_6,v_7)$ while the comparator shows Neq=1): this violates the left seam local rule which requires Eq=1 for $\\\\CAP$. The local radius--1 neighbourhood of nodes $v_6,v_7$ and the adjacent comparator tile now shows (CertTrack=$\\\\CAP$, Eq=0) which is not in the allowed list. Hence the configuration is rejected locally at the seam edge.\\n\\\\item Attempt to place $\\\\CAP$ in Case~A but with sign mismatch: suppose an adversary attempted to put $\\\\CAP$ at $(v_7,v_8)$ but altered S1 to $\\\\VF$ while RUN sgn[1]=$+$ (so SelectedSgn=$+$). The right seam local rule requires SelectedSgn to equal the S1 sign (mapping $\\\\VT\\\\mapsto+$, $\\\\VF\\\\mapsto-$). The neighbourhood $(S1=\\\\VF, SelectedSgn=+)$ violates the local sign-match requirement; hence the tile at $v_7$ adjacent to the seam fails the radius--1 check and is rejected.\\n\\\\end{enumerate}\\nThese two points demonstrate concretely how CAP/PAD leakage or sign-mismatch CAPs are prevented by purely local checks.\\n\\n\\\\section{Summary and remarks}\\nWe have produced:\\n\\\\begin{itemize}[nosep]\\n\\\\item explicit seam adjacency tables that implement the invariants required by the verifier notes (no $\\\\botSym$ when Offer, CertStart default, CAP only on Eq+sign match, PAD only on Neq, no CAP/PAD leakage);\\n\\\\item unified S-palettes $\\\\mathcal S_1$ and $\\\\mathcal S_2$;\\n\\\\item per-bit comparator tiles and HotRID$\\\\leftrightarrow$RIDbit pointer-integrity local rules, RUN exposure and Selected gating, and a short inductive proof that Eq and Neq cannot both accept;\\n\\\\item barrier tokens and local rules forbidding witness/cursor crossing, with an F2 locality argument showing repetition of modules separated by barriers produces independent, well-formed modules;\\n\\\\item an optional radius--1 input-forwarding track for activation; and\\n\\\\item a concrete $B=2$ patch (12 nodes) with an ON and an OFF instance, listed with exact tokens and explicit local failure points for illegal attempts.\\n\\\\end{itemize}\\n\\nEverything in this document is stated as radius--1 local rules (allowed adjacency/triple patterns) and short proofs that are purely local or inductive over the bit-chain, hence fully rigorous within the tiling/local-rule model. If you would like these tables translated into canonical Wang-tile listing (one tile per allowed radius--1 neighbourhood), or into an explicit finite-state automaton enumerating the allowed labels on each site, I can produce that next (for example: enumerate all allowed triples per seam edge and all allowed per-bit comparator neighbourhood tiles as a machine-readable table).\\n\\n\\\\section*{Acknowledgements}\\nThis text implements the verifier notes (2025-08-27) gate/seam behaviour and the requested worked example.\\n\\n\\\\end{document}\\n\",\"errors_md\":\"\"}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"default","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"WriterOutput","schema_":{"properties":{"status":{"description":"success|failed","title":"Status","type":"string"},"action":{"description":"replace","title":"Action","type":"string"},"tex_content":{"default":"","description":"Full LaTeX document content","title":"Tex Content","type":"string"},"errors_md":{"default":"","description":"Compile or rigor errors, if any","title":"Errors Md","type":"string"}},"required":["status","action","tex_content","errors_md"],"title":"WriterOutput","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":1417,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":22757,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":13120},"total_tokens":24174},"user":null,"store":true}
