  "progress_md": "Mini-plan for this round\n- Freeze the seam gadget as radius-1, type-local, with two S-nodes S1 (variable side) and S2 (clause side). Give explicit allowed-pair tables on the three edges (Lbound\u2192S1), (S1\u2192S2), (S2\u2192Rbound) to (i) forbid \u22a5 at S on active seams, (ii) start a certificate only if both sides offer, and (iii) gate CAP/PAD.\n- Instantiate equality/inequality certificates with pointer-integrity tiles and per-bit comparator tiles; state exclusivity precisely and show which out\u2013out pairs enforce it.\n- Introduce nearest-block barriers one node past the RUN footer; show they kill cursors and thus make (F2) independent of the repetition count z without trivializing (F1).\n- Give a B=2 worked DP trace for one ON and one OFF pair.\n- Note gaps in outputs.md: (a) B.6 trivializes (F2) via \u22a5 on repeats; we replace this by barrier-based (F2). (b) S had a single palette {RED,GRN,BLU,\u22a5}; we split into S1\u2208{VT,VF,\u22a5} and S2\u2208{O1,O2,O3,\u22a5} and bind sign to RUN.\n\nA. Explicit seam rules (radius-1, type-local)\nTokens (constant-size tracks)\n- BlockRole on seam-adjacent neighbors (one node away from S):\n  - VarSide: RoleL \u2208 {AccVar, NeutralVar, BarVar}\n  - ClauseSide: RoleR \u2208 {AccCla, NeutralCla, BarCla}\n- S-palettes:\n  - S1 \u2208 {\u22a5, VTidle, VFidle, EqStart, NeqStart, CAP, PAD}\n  - S2 \u2208 {\u22a5, O1idle, O2idle, O3idle, EqStart, NeqStart, CAP, PAD}\n  Here \u201cidle\u201d variants carry the long-lived choice (VT/VF on S1, Op on S2). EqStart/NeqStart/CAP/PAD are the (short) cursor tokens on the central seam; they are disallowed at the two outer seams (see below).\n- Offer/NoOffer (encoded in Role\u25cf): AccVar/AccCla emit Offer; Neutral\u25cf/Bar\u25cf emit NoOffer (a subtrack bit embedded in Role\u25cf symbols).\n- Barrier tokens: BarVar, BarCla (only at the first node beyond each RUN footer).\n\nEdge (out\u2013out) tables at the three seams\n1) Left seam (Lbound\u2192S1):\n- (AccVar, S1\u2208{VTidle, VFidle}) allowed; (AccVar, S1=\u22a5) forbidden; (AccVar, S1\u2208{EqStart,NeqStart,CAP,PAD}) forbidden.\n- (NeutralVar, S1=\u22a5) allowed; (NeutralVar, S1\u2260\u22a5) forbidden.\n- (BarVar, any S1) allowed only if S1=\u22a5 (BarVar acts like Neutral at the seam and blocks cursors; see barriers below).\nIntuition: Active left forces non-\u22a5 and freezes S1 to an idle truth token; inactive/Bar forces \u22a5.\n\n2) Right seam (S2\u2192Rbound):\n- (S2\u2208{O1idle,O2idle,O3idle}, AccCla) allowed; (\u22a5, AccCla) forbidden; (S2\u2208{EqStart,NeqStart,CAP,PAD}, AccCla) forbidden.\n- (\u22a5, NeutralCla) allowed; (non-\u22a5, NeutralCla) forbidden.\n- (\u22a5, BarCla) allowed; (non-\u22a5, BarCla) forbidden.\nIntuition: Active right forces non-\u22a5 and freezes S2 to an idle occurrence; inactive/Bar forces \u22a5.\n\n3) Central seam (S1\u2192S2): three phases\n- Idle alignment: allowed pairs are exactly (VTidle, Op_idle) for Op\u2208{O1idle,O2idle,O3idle}, i.e., the pair that carries both idle choices. No other cross-idle pairs are permitted.\n- Certificate start: EqStart/NeqStart may appear on the central seam only as (EqStart,EqStart) or (NeqStart,NeqStart); moreover, these pairs are allowed only if S1\u2019s left neighbor is AccVar and S2\u2019s right neighbor is AccCla (this is enforced by the outer seam tables above: S1/S2 cannot hold EqStart/NeqStart unless the outer seams admitted the corresponding idle choices).\n- CAP/PAD emission: (CAP,CAP) and (PAD,PAD) are the only accepting terminal pairs on the central seam, enabled by the certificate success states (see Section B). No cross CAP/PAD mix is allowed.\nRemarks: These three central-seam clauses implement \u201cboth-sides offer\u201d (both outer seams must be active to ever place EqStart/NeqStart) and mutual exclusion of CAP/PAD, with radius-1 consistency (each seam checks a pair of adjacent symbols only).\n\nB. Equality/inequality certificates (pointer integrity and exclusivity)\nLocal lanes near S\n- Variable block exports, adjacent to its AccVar interface:\n  - RIDbits[b] \u2208 {0,1} for b=0..B\u22121 on fixed bit lanes;\n  - HotRID one-hot over B positions; a \u201clane glue\u201d subtrack ties HotRID\u2019s unique 1 to the RIDbits encoding (standard local consistency: each lane carries its bit value; the unique HotRID=1 cell carries a \u201cmatch\u201d mark, and per-lane tiles enforce that the marked lane bit equals the global RIDbits pattern; any mismatch triggers the error-chain and kills Offer).\n- Clause block exports, adjacent to its AccCla interface:\n  - For each p\u2208{1,2,3}, ip_bits[b] on bit lanes, with a Selected pointer subtrack that equals ip_bits when S2 chose Op (the Selected track is writable only when O_p\u2019s own \u201cphase\u201d bit coming from RUN is present; otherwise error-chain);\n  - Sign sgn[p] \u2208 {+,\u2212} on a 1-bit lane, likewise tied to the chosen Op via the same Selected mechanism.\n- Cursor lanes: a 1-cell-wide corridor along which the Eq/Neq cursor walks: S1\u2192left lanes (RIDbits), returns to S1, crosses to S2, walks to right lanes (ip_bits), returns; or equivalently, two unidirectional cursors EqL and EqR with a central handshaking at S1/S2 (both treatments can be reduced to radius-1 pair checks; we take the latter).\n\nCursor tokens and tiles\n- EqL[b], EqR[b]: equality cursors at bit b on left/right sides, with b encoded in unary across a short address subtrack of length B (a standard \u201cruler\u201d pattern so the cursor can locally enforce that it is at position b and moves to b+1 only from b).\n- NeqPick[b], NeqCheckL[b], NeqCheckR[b]: inequality cursors that (i) nondeterministically pick b at S (through NeqStart), (ii) visit RIDbits[b] and ip_bits[b] to check a mismatch.\n- Update/acceptance tiles (all are out\u2013out pairs on adjacent edges):\n  - EqL[b] requires RIDbits[b] = ip_bits[b] (seen via the central seam handshaking; concretely: S1 holds EqL[b] and S2 holds EqR[b]; the allowed pair (EqL[b],EqR[b]) is present only if a third read-only subtrack on each side encodes the respective bit values and they match; this read-only subtrack is part of S1/S2 labels and is copied from the adjacent lanes at AccVar/AccCla by local consistency). EqL[b]\u2192EqL[b+1] is allowed iff (RIDbits[b] = ip_bits[b]); EqL[B] emits CAP at S1; EqR mirrors this.\n  - NeqCheckL[b]/NeqCheckR[b] require RIDbits[b] \u2260 ip_bits[b] (same handshaking idea); upon success, emit PAD at S1/S2.\n  - No tile allows Eq and Neq to be both present.\n- Sign binding (on CAP only): The (CAP,CAP) central pair is allowed only if the S1 idle truth matches the chosen sign sgn[p] exported by RUN (a read-only bit on S2 that is tied to Op via Selected). Concretely, (CAP,CAP) is allowed iff (S1 carried VTidle and sgn[p]=+) or (S1 carried VFidle and sgn[p]=\u2212). This prohibits a CAP completion on a mismatched sign.\n\nExclusivity lemma (radius-1)\nClaim E\u2019. For any active pair (AccVar on the left, AccCla on the right) and chosen Op, exactly one of Eq or Neq can reach its terminal (CAP vs PAD):\n- If RID = ip, then for all b, RIDbits[b]=ip_bits[b] holds locally; Eq\u2019s per-bit tiles propagate to b=B and emit CAP; Neq cannot place NeqCheck at any b (mismatch predicate never true), hence no PAD.\n- If RID \u2260 ip, then there exists b with RIDbits[b]\u2260ip_bits[b]; Neq can pick such b and reach PAD; Eq stalls at the first mismatching b and never reaches CAP.\nPointer integrity and read-only mirroring of bit values at S1/S2 ensure no spoofing; any inconsistency on Selected or the RUN lanes is locally refutable by the error-chain, which removes Offer (makes the seam inactive).\n\nC. Nearest-block barriers and (F2)\nBarrier placement and local rules\n- Each well-formed block (both Var and Clause) ends with a fixed footer token Footer, followed immediately by a barrier token BarVar (left side) or BarCla (right side) at the seam-adjacent interior node one step beyond RUN. The block grammar enforces (Footer\u2192Barrier) by Cout\u2013out within the block. Malformed blocks cannot produce Footer and thus cannot produce Bar\u25cf; they must switch to the error-chain which never emits Offer and thus behave as Neutral.\n- The barrier forbids cursor tokens: on the edges (Barrier\u2194next) and (prev\u2194Barrier) we allow only PAD plumbing and forbid any Eq/Neq/CAP/PAD cursor token. Moreover, Role\u25cf=Bar\u25cf at the seam-adjacent interior node forces the seam to be treated as Neutral (see A.1\u20132).\n\nWhy (F2) holds automatically on our instances\n- Only the nearest blocks can emit Offer and accept EqStart/NeqStart: the Offer/Acc\u25cf roles are placed at the unique seam-interface of a block; beyond Footer+Barrier no other role can emit Offer, and barriers kill cursors within one step.\n- Therefore, the presence of extra repeats wz on either side has no effect on the S-bridge: (i) if the base bridge is active, the same Eq/Neq check runs entirely within the nearest blocks; (ii) if the base bridge is inactive or OFF, PAD-only conduits complete regardless of repeats; all interior seams between repeated copies are block-internal and satisfiable by the block grammar.\nFormal consequence: For any fixed context (w1,S,w2), the success/failure of the bridge on wz1 S wz2 is identical to that on w1 S w2, for all z\u22651. Hence once (F1) holds, (F2) holds automatically on our reduction family.\n\nD. B=2 worked DP trace\nSetup\n- Variable block with RID=10 (x2), AccVar adjacent to S1; Clause block for clause j with occurrences: (i1=01,+), (i2=10,\u2212), (i3=11,+), AccCla adjacent to S2. Both blocks \u2018Offer\u2019 at their interfaces (AccVar/AccCla), so outer seam forbids \u22a5 at S1/S2.\nCase ON: select O2, set S1=VFidle (since sgn2=\u2212)\n- Left seam: (AccVar, VFidle) allowed.\n- Right seam: (O2idle, AccCla) allowed.\n- Central seam idle pair: (VFidle, O2idle) allowed.\n- Certificate: EqStart placed at (S1,S2); EqL[0]/EqR[0] read RIDbits[0]=0, ip_bits[0]=0 (match)\u2192advance; EqL[1]/EqR[1] read RIDbits[1]=1, ip_bits[1]=1 (match)\u2192advance; at b=2=B, emit (CAP,CAP) on the central seam.\n- CAP gate: (CAP,CAP) allowed only if sgn2=\u2212 and S1 had VFidle: holds; acceptance.\nCase OFF: select O1, S1 arbitrary\n- With O1idle at S2 and RID=10 vs ip=01, Eq stalls at b=0 (0=0 ok) then b=1 sees 1\u22600: no tile allows EqL[1]/EqR[1], so Eq fails.\n- Neq: pick b=1; NeqCheckL[1]/NeqCheckR[1] sees 1\u22600 and emits (PAD,PAD) which is accepted on the central seam; barriers prevent any further propagation; acceptance independent of S1\u2019s VT/VF.\nEdge-check: Attempt S1=\u22a5 or S2=\u22a5 on these active seams is rejected by outer seam tables.\n\nE. Notes on type coverage and separation (no j\u22c6 needed)\n- Coverage: Pumping and replacement guarantee contexts exist with a well-formed variable block of any chosen RID adjacent to S and conversely for any clause GID; malformed blocks are neutral. Hence for each i and j there exist active context types realizing \u201cVar(i)\u201d (some right filler) and \u201cClause(j)\u201d (some left filler).\n- Separation for reduction: We do not require a one-to-one mapping Var_i\u2194type for all i. It suffices that for each i there exists at least one active left-type realizing RID=i and for each j at least one active right-type realizing GID=j; the (F1) constraints across all ordered pairs still encode the succinct CNF exactly (every pair (Var(i), Clause(j)) imposes ON iff i equals the selected occurrence, and OFF otherwise). Multiple left-types realizing the same i impose the same constraints and can be set consistently by the same \u03b1(x_i).\n\nF. Corrections and gaps in outputs.md\n- Single-S palette vs split palettes: Section B.3 of outputs.md used a single S with {RED,GRN,BLU,\u22a5}. Our seam now uses two S-nodes with S1\u2208{VT,VF,\u22a5} and S2\u2208{O1,O2,O3,\u22a5}, with sign bound to RUN via the CAP gate. This removes the sign-cheat and \u22a5-trivialization problems.\n- Trivializing (F2) via \u22a5 (outputs.md, B.6): Allowing arbitrary \u22a5 on repeats risks leaking into bridges and undermining (F1). We instead enforce nearest-block barriers that locally block cursors and Offer beyond the first block; (F2) then holds automatically for our family without changing the (F1) constraints.\n\nG. Why this still yields NEXPTIME-hardness for (F1) and the full classification\n- With the above seam and certificates, the mid-consistency constraints (F1) encode Succinct-3SAT exactly: choose f(Var(i))\u2208{VT,VF} as \u03b1(x_i), and f(Cl(j))\u2208{O1,O2,O3}; then (Var(i),Cl(j)) bridge succeeds iff either OFF (i\u2260i_p) or ON with truth matching sign (i=ip and \u03b1 satisfies the chosen literal). Conversely, any f satisfying (F1) yields a satisfying \u03b1.\n- By barriers, (F2) holds automatically on the constructed instances; hence the three-way classifier must distinguish O(1) (if \u03a6C is satisfiable) from \u0398(n) (otherwise), establishing NEXPTIME-hardness for the classification.\n\nH. Next steps to further solidify\n- List the exact local tiles (as out\u2013out pairs) tying HotRID\u2194RIDbits and Selected(ip)\u2194RUN, and the error-chain tiles that deactivate malformed blocks.\n- Tabulate the central seam pairs for Eq/Neq at b=0,1,2 and CAP/PAD for B=2 (a small explicit table the verifier can check by hand).\n- Give the short proof sketches that (i) S1/S2 cannot hold EqStart/NeqStart unless both outer seams are active (follows from the seam tables), and (ii) barriers forbid cursor propagation in \u22641 step.\n- Provide a micro-alphabet count showing |\u03a3out|=\u03b2=poly(s) after adding the new tokens and that \u2113pump=2\u0398(\u03b2^4)\u226bpoly(s) remains.\n\nI. Quick sanity probes and how they are blocked\n- Try PAD on ON: PAD central pair requires Neq success; impossible if RID=ip; (PAD,PAD) pair disallowed without Neq.\n- Try \u22a5 at S on active: outer seam tables forbid (AccVar,\u22a5) and (\u22a5,AccCla).\n- Spoof sign: CAP central pair checks S1\u2019s VT/VF against sgn[p] copied from RUN; mismatched pair disallowed.\n- Cross into non-nearest blocks: barrier tokens BarVar/BarCla forbid cursor tokens and force seam neutrality.\n\nThis round\u2019s deliverables\n- Seam tables around S1/S2, including Offer/NoOffer, idle, start, and CAP/PAD pairs.\n- Equality/inequality cursor tokens and comparator semantics; exclusivity statement with locality justification.\n- Barrier tokens and proof sketch for (F2) locality.\n- A B=2 ON/OFF DP trace.\n\nThese meet the verifier\u2019s action items: explicit seam tables, bit-comparator/pointer-integrity scheme, barrier tokens and short proof, and a B=2 worked example. Pending: transcribe the comparator and Selected/HotRID integrity into a small explicit set of out\u2013out pairs and count the symbols to reconfirm \u03b2=poly(s)."
