\paragraph{One-line summary.}
Prove NEXPTIME-hardness for the following problem. Given a $\beta$-normalized, radius-1 LCL on globally oriented paths, the problem is to decide whether the local complexity of that problem is $O(1)$ vs.\ $\Omega(\log^* n)$ vs.\ $\Omega(n)$.


\section*{Problem setup}


We work in the standard \textsc{Local} model on globally oriented paths. An LCL is \emph{$\beta$-normalized (radius 1)} if it has:
\begin{itemize}
  \item binary input alphabet $\SigIn=\{0,1\}$,
  \item output alphabet $\SigOut$ of size $\beta$,
  \item legality checked only by two tables: $\Cinout\subseteq\SigIn\times\SigOut$ and $\Coutout\subseteq\SigOut\times\SigOut$.
\end{itemize}
A labeling is legal iff $(\mathrm{in}(v),\mathrm{out}(v))\in \Cinout$ at each node $v$ and $(\mathrm{out}(u),\mathrm{out}(v))\in \Coutout$ on each directed edge $u\!\to\! v$.


\paragraph{Encoding size.}
We assume an explicit encoding of $(\Cinout,\Coutout)$ of size $\mathrm{poly}(\beta)$ (e.g., $\Cinout$ as a $2\times \beta$ Boolean table and $\Coutout$ as a $\beta\times \beta$ Boolean table). We measure time in the input length $N=\mathrm{poly}(\beta)$.


\paragraph{Your task}
Your task is to prove that this task is hard as possible. Aim for NEXPTIME-hardness. 


\paragraph{First attached paper}
The attached paper proves that the problem is PSPACE-hard. Their reduction shows that one can encode the execution of an automaton as a local problem. You have to understand that paper thoroughly, since your goal is to improve upon their result. However, that proof does not easily generalize – it is important that the tape of the simulated automaton has polynomial length, which naively cannot lead to a better than PSPACE hardness. 


\paragraph{Second attached draft}
The attached draft shows the sketch of a proof of a better NEXPTIME algorithm than the one in the original paper. This may give you some intuition about the computational bottleneck that can be used to prove hardness.

...
ength tableau (still radius-1, constant alphabet overhead). If errors were non-refutable, inactive contexts could force constraints; the error-chain gadget prevents that.
- Quick test: For a hand-built clause-index j, create a tiny RUN with 3 marked rows carrying the one-hot i_t and sgnt bits at fixed offsets. Flip one bit and confirm that an error-chain can be placed locally and that any non-⊥ S-choice against a malformed block is rejected by the DP.

6) Inactive contexts are harmless; (F2) trivialization
Claim L (Inactive contexts force ⊥; (F2) is made vacuous). If a context’s wb (resp. wc) lacks a well-formed variable (resp. clause) block, any non-⊥ at S is locally rejected (witness chain cannot find headers/indices). A dedicated PAD/⊥-plumbing language in Cout–out allows arbitrary filling when OFF or ⊥ at S. If we further allow wz repeats to be ⊥-fillable regardless of z, (F2) holds for any f, and the classification collapses to O(1) iff (F1) feasible, else Θ(n) by the gap theorem.
- Why useful here: Neutralizes irrelevant pairs and reduces the tri-class decision to (F1) on our instances.
- How it can fail: If PAD/⊥ seams were incompatible with S choices, OFF wouldn’t be trivially fillable; we explicitly include seam-compatible PAD/⊥ pairs in Cout–out.
- Quick test: Take an inactive left context and any right context. Try S=VT; the DP fails early (no HEAD/RID found). Set S=⊥; the DP runs a PAD/⊥ conduit and succeeds.

7) Putting it together: reduction to implicit SAT (Succinct-3SAT → F(P))
- Source: circuit C of size s defining ΦC with 2^B variables and 2^B clauses, each clause(j) has three occurrences (i1,sgn1),(i2,sgn2),(i3,sgn3).
- Target: PC with Σout and Cout–out implementing Claims H–L; β=poly(s), r=1, |description|=poly(β)=poly(s). By Claim J, C’s type set contains all τVar(i) and τCl(j). By Claim I, there exists f satisfying (F1) for PC iff ΦC is satisfiable. By Claim L, we can trivialize (F2) if we target full classification hardness.
- Complexity: Types count ℓpump=2^{Θ(β^4)}=2^{poly(s)}; we never enumerate them in the reduction. Verification of each bridge is via O(kβ^2) DP (k=Θ(ℓpump)), consistent with the NEXPTIME upper bound.

8) Toy worked example (B=2, indices 00..11)
- Let clause j encode (x01 ∨ ¬x10 ∨ x11). Suppose α(x01)=0, α(x10)=1, α(x11)=0.
- Choices: set f(τVar(01))=VF, f(τVar(10))=VT, f(τVar(11))=VF. Set f(τCl(j))=O2 (choose occurrence 2: ¬x10). For ordered pairs: (τVar(10),τCl(j)) ON and requires VT= (sgn2=−)? No, ON demands VF when sgnt=−. Oops: we must require VT iff sgnt=+ and VF iff sgnt=−; thus for occurrence 2 (negative), left must be VF to pass. Since α(x10)=1, O2 would fail. Correct choice is O1 or O3? O1 has sgn1=+, requires VT at Var(01), but α(x01)=0, so fail. O3 has sgn3=+, requires VT at Var(11), but α(x11)=0, so fail. Therefore, α does not satisfy this clause; no O_t makes the ON-pair succeed, as intended. If we flip α(x10)=0, then O2 makes (τVar(10),τCl(j)) succeed and all other pairs OFF; (F1) holds for this j.
- Takeaway: For each clause j, there exists exactly those Ot consistent with α that make all pairs pass; otherwise (F1) fails.

9) Open items and quantitative checks
- Boundary tables: Write explicit Cin–out/Cout–out rows for S-seams enforcing: (i) non-⊥ at S emits Offer tokens and forbids PAD unless OFF, (ii) OFF⇔mismatch of (RID,it), (iii) ON enforces CAP wire equality truth↔sgn_t, (iv) PAD/⊥ seams accept any colors when OFF.
- Clause RUN tiles: Provide a fixed set of row-local tiles producing/exposing (i_t,sgn_t) and validating them against header C and GID=j, with a bounded error alphabet E to refute any malformed run.
- Type separation proof: Formally exhibit, for i≠i′, some counterpart type so that the sets of extendible boundary assignments differ (hence distinct types). Likewise for clauses.
- Rule budgets: Count tracks/symbols to confirm |Σout|=β=poly(s). ℓpump≫poly(s) so that windows can host headers+indices+RUN comfortably.

How this answers “reduce to implicit exponential-sized SAT formula”
- The existence of a feasible f is equivalent to satisfiability of the implicit SAT F(P): variables are (A_i) and (T_j), constraints are local bridge constraints per (τVar(i),τCl(j)), exponentially many but specified implicitly by P (via DP over ℓpump-length contexts). Our reduction from C maps ΦC to F(PC) with the property F(PC) satisfiable iff ΦC satisfiable. This yields NEXPTIME-hardness of feasible-function existence, and (by trivializing (F2)) the full O(1) vs Θ(n) classification.

## Round 0003 — 2025-08-27T11:30:44.019901Z

Mini-plan
- Patch the active-window semantics: forbid ⊥ at S on active contexts; adopt occurrence-only clause palette {O1,O2,O3}; bind sign from the verified RUN tracks.
- State and prove a radius-1 Exclusivity Lemma for equality vs. inequality witness chains; pin down the local invariants (one-hot, pointer integrity, eq_so_far register).
- Specify seam rules (offers, ON/OFF gate, CAP/PAD conduits) at the two S-nodes; show (F2) can be trivialized via PAD on repeats without trivializing (F1).
- Add a type-separation lemma using a neutral tester clause j* to guarantee distinct Var_i types independent of C.
- Validate with a B=2 toy: enumerate one clause and 3 variable pairs; check ON/OFF and sign-binding behavior; probe a couple of cheating attempts.

1) Patch A: Active S forbids ⊥; occurrence-only palette with sign bound to RUN
Claim A1 (Active-window S palette and sign binding).
- Clause-side S2 palette is occurrence-only: {O1, O2, O3} (no sign); variable-side S1 palette is truth-only: {VT, VF}. The sign of occurrence p ∈ {1,2,3} is exported from the clause RUN on a local subtrack sgn[p] ∈ {+,−}.
- Activity and ⊥. Introduce boundary Offer tokens emitted by well-formed blocks immediately adjacent to S. Cout–out forbids S ∈ {⊥} adjacent to an Offer; permits S ∈ {⊥} iff the adjacent side emits NoOffer (which only happens if the side is inactive or error-refuted). Thus: S is forced non-⊥ on active contexts; ⊥ allowed only on inactive ones.
- ON condition: Both sides active and clause S2 = Op. The gate is ON iff RID = ip (selected occurrence index) (checked by the witness in Claim E below). On ON, CAP conduit must be used and enforces VT iff sgn[p] = + and VF iff sgn[p] = −.
- OFF condition: If not (RID = ip), the inequality witness must be used (Claim E), and only PAD conduit is permitted; no CAP may be present.
Why useful here: This patch addresses two critical issues: it prevents f(·) ≡ ⊥ from trivially satisfying (F1), and it removes sign choices from S, forcing the sign to match the verified RUN output.
How it can fail:
- If a malformed right block could still legally emit Offer near S, the instance could be forced active without a valid RUN, breaking soundness. We prevent this by making Offer admissible only at the unique boundary positions of the HEADC/RUN grammar; any malformed structure must switch to error-chain tracks that never emit Offer.
- If sign[p] could be spoofed locally, the clause could cheat its sign. We enforce sgn[p] as a read-only track driven by the RUN tableau; any mismatch with RUN is locally refutable via an error-chain, and there is no permitted local transition that sets sgn[p] arbitrarily.
Quick test/counterexample attempt: Construct a right context missing the RUN rows but with an Offer token. The seam rule at the HEADC→RUN boundary refuses changing from PAD to Offer without the exact RUN row header; thus S cannot be non-⊥; with S forced to ⊥, the pair is inactive and imposes no constraint.

2) Lemma E: Exclusivity of equality vs inequality witnesses (radius-1)
Claim E (Exclusivity and determinism of the ON/OFF gate). For an active ordered pair with clause pick p and indices (RID on left, ip on right), the following holds under radius-1 witness semantics:
- There exists a valid equality witness path if and only if RID = ip. If such a path exists, the grammar enables CAP and forbids PAD at the seam.
- There exists a valid inequality witness path if and only if RID ≠ ip. If such a path exists, the grammar enables PAD and forbids CAP at the seam.
- The two witnesses are mutually exclusive: at most one is realizable for any given pair.
Local invariants and implementation (tracks and transitions):
- One-hot indices. Left block exports HotRID[1..B] with exactly one 1; right block exports Occ[p][1..B] with exactly one 1 (Occ is the one-hot for ip, selected by S2 = Op through fixed local pointers inside RUN’s outputs). Nearest-neighbor consistency enforces one-hotness rowwise.
- Bit-lanes. Both blocks expose the binary expansions RID_bits[1..B] and ip_bits[1..B] alongside the one-hots.
- Witness chain and eq_so_far register. A single-symbol-width chain walks across bit positions b = 1..B. The chain carries a mode flag eq ∈ {0,1}. Start at b = 1 with eq = 1. At each step, the only allowed transition updates eq ← eq ∧ (RID_bits[b] == ip_bits[b]). At b = B + 1, the chain halts.
- Acceptance rules. Equality certificate accepts iff the chain reaches b = B + 1 with eq = 1. Inequality certificate accepts iff at some b a designated Mismatch token is placed; placing Mismatch is legal only on steps where (RID_bits[b] ≠ ip_bits[b]) and eq was 1 just before the step. Once Mismatch is placed, the remaining steps propagate a neq-mode that cannot flip back to eq = 1, and acceptance is at the end.
- CAP/PAD gating. CAP may be emitted only if the equality certificate accepts; PAD may be emitted only if the inequality certificate accepts. There is no rule allowing CAP (resp., PAD) without the corresponding accepted witness state.
Why useful here: Encodes the ON/OFF dichotomy so that exactly one of the two certificates can succeed, with all checks performed by two-node constraints.
How it can fail:
- Fabricating a Mismatch when RID = ip: disallowed since setting Mismatch requires (RID_bits[b] ≠ ip_bits[b]) locally, which is false at every b if equal.
- Forcing eq to remain 1 when RID ≠ ip: impossible because eq updates are locally determined by the observed bits; a mismatch forces eq ← 0 and cannot flip back.
- Combining both CAP and PAD: impossible because CAP requires eq(B+1)=1 while PAD requires a Mismatch and eq must become 0; the mode flag prevents simultaneous acceptance.
Quick test/counterexample attempt (B=3):
- RID=5 (101), ip=5 (101): equality chain has eq path 1→1→1→1; accepts; PAD disallowed (no allowed Mismatch placement). RID=5, ip=6 (110): at b=2, bits differ; eq flips to 0; equality fails; inequality can place Mismatch at b=2 and accept; CAP disallowed.

3) Seam rules: offers, gate, CAP/PAD conduits; trivializing (F2) safely
Claim S (Seam rule schema around S).
- Left seam (wb↔S1). If the left neighbor outputs OfferL, then S1 ∈ {VT,VF} is required; S1=⊥ is forbidden. If the left neighbor outputs NoOfferL, then S1=⊥ is the only admissible S1 label.
- Right seam (S2↔wc). If the right neighbor outputs OfferR, then S2 ∈ {O1,O2,O3} is required; S2=⊥ is forbidden. If NoOfferR, then S2=⊥ is the only admissible S2 label.
- ON/OFF enforcement. If both seams present Offer and S2 = Op, Cout–out enables exactly one of two seam grammars depending on the witness mode: ON: CAP conduit (a single-bit wire that propagates from S1 to S2 and is locally compared to sgn[p]); OFF: PAD conduit (neutral filler). The CAP seam forbids PAD tokens; the PAD seam forbids CAP tokens.
- Repeat-PAD (for (F2)). For every context (w1,S,w2) and any z≥1, the tables admit filling each repetition wz_i by a RepeatPAD track that is locally compatible with any S color and with the block-seam on the opposite side of S. RepeatPAD never appears in bridges (wb◦wc) and never coexists with Offer within a block. Hence: (F2) holds vacuously for repeats while (F1) bridges remain nontrivial.
Why useful here: Keeps (F1) hard (since ON forbids PAD bypasses and requires CAP) while allowing (F2) to be made vacuous via RepeatPAD that ignores the length z and does not depend on equality.
How it can fail:
- If RepeatPAD were allowed inside bridges (wb◦wc), it could trivialize (F1); we explicitly forbid PAD on bridges when the gate is ON.
- If Offer could appear alongside RepeatPAD inside wz blocks, the context would become spuriously active; we forbid Offer transitions on RepeatPAD tracks.
Quick test/counterexample attempt: Consider an active context with both offers and S2 = O2, RID ≠ i2. Try to use RepeatPAD in wb◦wc: Cout–out rejects because bridges only allow PAD under an accepted inequality witness; RepeatPAD is only valid inside wz repeats in (F2), not inside bridges.

4) Type separation via a neutral tester clause j*
Claim T (Neutral tester guarantees distinct variable types). Add a reserved, well-formed clause type Cl_{j*} whose RUN deterministically outputs a clause with occurrences (i, dummy, dummy) and known sign, for each i in the needed range (or provide c different tester clause types if we need many). The construction validates these outputs by the same RUN checker and permits S2 ∈ {O1,O2,O3} accordingly.
- For any two variable types Var_i ≠ Var_{i'}, pair with Cl_{j*} configured to pick O1 (the i-occurrence). Under a fixed S1 (say VT), (Var_i, Cl_{j*}) is ON and completable iff VT matches the known sign; (Var_{i'}, Cl_{j*}) is OFF and completable via PAD. Therefore their boundary-extendibility signatures differ under the same S-color, forcing distinct types.
Why useful here: Ensures the existence of exponentially many distinct variable types without relying on idiosyncrasies of C; only needs the RUN tile set we already include.
How it can fail: If Cl_{j*} could be malformed yet still active, it might not separate types; the same Offer+RUN validation prevents that. If O1 could be set without binding to the i occurrence, the ON test could accidentally apply to i′; forbidden by the pointer integrity rules.
Quick test/counterexample attempt: Build Var_5 and Var_6 and pair with Cl_{j*} that exposes occurrence 1 = 5 (positive). With S1=VT and S2=O1, (Var_5,Cl_{j*}) has an equality witness and CAP passes; (Var_6,Cl_{j*}) only inequality witness exists and only PAD passes; types differ.

5) Clause RUN tile: sign-binding and occurrence selection
Claim R (RUN tableau exposes indices and signs; selection wiring is local). The right block’s RUN encodes a BO(1)-time simulation of U(C,j) that materializes:
- Three one-hot vectors Occ[1], Occ[2], Occ[3] ∈ {0,1}^B, each with a unique 1-bit at positions i1,i2,i3.
- Three sign bits sgn[1], sgn[2], sgn[3] ∈ {+,−}.
- Selection pointers: from S2 tokens Op, a fixed local wiring enables a Selected[·] subtrack that equals Occ[p] and a SelectedSgn that equals sgn[p].
The adjacency rules ensure that Op cannot enable Selected that disagrees with the underlying Occ/sgn. Any mismatch triggers an error-chain and deactivates the context (no Offer).
Why useful here: Guarantees the ON check uses the correct i_p and sign, with all information within radius-1 of S via short pointer chains, and aligns with Patch A’s palette.
How it can fail: If Selected could be chosen independently of RUN, the clause could cheat; we prevent by making Selected writable only when a local synchronization state (a phase bit) from the RUN row is present; otherwise, only error-chain transitions are legal. If we needed nonlocal access, that would break r=1; we avoid this by pre-exposing Occ and sgn as adjacent tracks.
Quick test/counterexample attempt: Force S2=O2 but flip sgn[2] in a RUN row. RUN consistency rejects the row; the only continuation is to switch into an error-chain that removes Offer; S must be ⊥ and the context becomes inactive.

6) B=2 toy validation
Setup: Variables x1..x4; one clause j encodes (x3 ∨ ¬x1 ∨ x4). Right RUN exports Occ[1]=one-hot for 3, sgn[1]=+; Occ[2]=one-hot for 1, sgn[2]=−; Occ[3]=one-hot for 4, sgn[3]=+.
- Case α: x1=1, x3=0, x4=0.
  - f(Var_1)=VT, f(Var_3)=VF, f(Var_4)=VF; pick S2=O1.
  - (Var_3, Cl_j): RID=3, ip=3 ⇒ equality witness exists; sgn[1]=+ but S1=VF, CAP comparison fails ⇒ bridge rejects. So O1 is incompatible with α.
  - Pick S2=O2 instead: (Var_1,Cl_j): RID=1, ip=1, equality witness exists; sgn[2]=− and S1=VT mismatches ⇒ reject. O3: (Var_4,Cl_j) equality exists but sgn[3]=+ vs S1=VF ⇒ reject. Thus no S2 works: clause unsatisfied under α.
- Flip α: x1=0,x3=1,x4=0 (i.e., f(Var_1)=VF, f(Var_3)=VT, f(Var_4)=VF).
  - With S2=O1: (Var_3,Cl_j) equality witness exists and sgn[1]=+ vs S1=VT matches; ON uses CAP; all other pairs OFF via inequality/PAD. (F1) passes for this clause.
Cheat probes:
- Try S=⊥ on active pair: forbidden by Offer seam; local check fails.
- Try to use PAD on ON: CAP-only seam disallows PAD tokens; DP dies immediately.
- Try equality witness with RID≠ip: eq_so_far flips to 0 at first mismatch; end state prevents CAP; DP fails.

7) SAT-of-types recapped under the patches
- Variables: for each Var_i active type, choose S1 ∈ {VT,VF} encoding α(x_i).
- Clause picks: for each Cl_j active type, choose S2 ∈ {O1,O2,O3} selecting one occurrence.
- Constraints: For each ordered pair (Var_i, Cl_j), the bridge succeeds iff either (i) it is OFF (RID≠ ip of the chosen p), or (ii) it is ON and α(x_{ip}) matches sgn[p]. Thus (F1) is equivalent to: for each j, there exists p such that the literal at position p is true under α. This is exactly Φ_C satisfiable.
Why useful here: Confirms the reduction still encodes the intended succinct-3SAT after the safety patches.
How it can fail: Only if OFF pairs imposed extra constraints; the Exclusivity Lemma and PAD-only rule guarantee they do not.
Quick test/counterexample attempt: For the toy clause above, selecting O2 enforces only α(x1)=0; pairs with Var_3 and Var_4 are OFF; no extra constraints appear.

What is now solid
- Active/inactive discipline at S (⊥ forbidden on active) and occurrence-only clause palette eliminate the two main pitfalls flagged by the verifier.
- A radius-1 exclusivity proof for equality vs. inequality witnesses (eq_so_far monotonicity, mismatch token rules) prevents bypasses and spurious ONs.
- A seam-rule schema that makes (F2) vacuous via RepeatPAD while keeping (F1) nontrivial.
- A neutral tester clause j* ensures type separation independent of C, addressing the multiplicity of active types robustly.

Open items to finalize (explicit artifacts)
- Enumerate the Cin–out/Cout–out entries at the four seams (left boundary→S1, S1→right bridge, left bridge→S2, S2→right boundary), specifying the exact allowed pairs for: Offer/NoOffer, CAP/PAD, witness-step tokens, and RepeatPAD adjacency.
- List the RUN tile set: the per-row neighbor constraints for U, and the local exposure of Occ[·] and sgn[·]; define the error-chain alphabet and transitions.
- Package the tester j* as a concrete right-block type with its own header tag, and show it does not interfere with the main reduction.
- A tabulated B=2 DP trace for 3–4 representative pairs to sanity-check all seam interactions (especially CAP comparison to sgn[p]).

## Round 0003 — 2025-08-27T11:30:44.027502Z

Mini-plan
- Fix the three correctness gaps flagged by the verifier: (A) forbid ⊥ at S on active seams via explicit radius-1 seam rules; (B) bind the sign to the clause RUN by adopting the occurrence-only palette {O1,O2,O3}; (C) prove exclusivity of equality vs inequality certificates with local invariants.
- Specify the seam grammar around S: enumerate allowed Cout–out pairs between S and its two neighbors; define the Offer/Accept handshake and CAP/PAD conduits; make OFF pairs neutral and ON pairs enforce the equality-and-sign check.
- Formalize the pointer/witness chains and the one-hot/binary compare: what tracks exist, how the chain advances, and what local checks prevent faking.
- Provide a robust type-separation lemma (using a tester clause j⋆ if needed) and a B=2 toy check of ON/OFF behavior.
- Reconcile with the reduction: with (F1) only, the family lands in {Θ(log* n), Θ(n)} depending on SAT(C); we do not need to trivialize (F2) (avoid the ⊥-plumbing pitfall for (F1)).

1) Seam grammar around S: tokens, roles, and local rules
We introduce constant-size output tokens and roles used only in the 2 nodes S and their immediate neighbors on each side.
- S-side tokens (clause side): ClauseSelect ∈ {O1, O2, O3}. No sign is encoded at S.
- S-side tokens (variable side): VarTruth ∈ {VT, VF}.
- S-side token ⊥ exists but is forbidden when the adjacent neighbor is active (defined below).
- Interface roles at the neighbor cells (the nodes immediately adjacent to S within wb or wc):
  - AccVar: boundary interface of a well-formed variable block adjacent to S on the left (contains anchors/pointers to RID one-hot and binary RID bits; see §3).
  - AccCla: boundary interface of a well-formed clause block adjacent to S on the right (contains anchors/pointers to the RUN outputs for occurrence indices and signs; see §2).
  - Neutral: any non-interface role (PAD, error-chain, or malformed)—used to deactivate the seam locally.
- Handshake (radius-1) via Cout–out on the two seam edges (left seam: neighbor←→S; right seam: S←→neighbor):
  - If neighbor role is AccVar: allowed S outputs are VarTruth ∈ {VT,VF}; S = ⊥ is forbidden (no Cout–out entry (AccVar, ⊥)).
  - If neighbor role is AccCla: allowed S outputs are ClauseSelect ∈ {O1,O2,O3}; S = ⊥ is forbidden (no Cout–out entry (⊥, AccCla)).
  - If neighbor role is Neutral: allowed S outputs include ⊥ and the non-⊥ tokens but all non-⊥ must emit Offer tokens (see below) that are immediately rejected unless the neighbor upgrades to an Acc● role (making the seam locally deciding). Practically: (Neutral, VarTruth) and (ClauseSelect, Neutral) have no accepting continuations except via immediate error-chain admission; (Neutral, ⊥) and (⊥, Neutral) are always allowed (PAD), ensuring inactive seams are neutral.
- Offer/Accept and certificate start: Non-⊥ at S forces emission of a certificate-start token CertStart on the first interior edge; CertStart is legal only if the adjacent neighbor is AccVar (left seam) or AccCla (right seam). Otherwise, Cout–out rejects and only ⊥ is feasible. This enforces “non-⊥ ⇒ active seam” locally.
- CAP/PAD conduits: Once CertStart is accepted on both sides, a CAP conduit is enabled only under equality (see §3), otherwise only a PAD conduit is enabled (OFF). The Cout–out table forbids placing any error-chain token adjacent to CAP (to prevent bypass), while PAD accepts error-chain tokens (to guarantee neutral fill when OFF).
Why useful here: This replaces the informal “activation” with explicit, radius-1 seam rules. It ensures (i) ⊥ cannot be used at S on active seams, preventing the trivial f ≡ ⊥; (ii) S non-⊥ forces the bridge to engage the certificate machinery; (iii) inactive contexts are always completable via ⊥ and PAD.
How it can fail: If AccVar/AccCla could appear spuriously at non-block neighbors, we would misclassify seams as active. We prevent this by tying Acc● to the internal block grammar: the only roles allowed adjacent to S with Acc● are those that anchor HEAD/RID (variable) or HEAD/GID/RUN (clause); any other role adjacent to S is Neutral, as enforced by Cout–out.
Quick test: In a malformed right context, label S with O2. The neighbor is Neutral, so CertStart is rejected and no completion exists, forcing ⊥ at S (or an error-chain). In a well-formed clause context, O2 is accepted and the certificate starts.

2) Sign binding (occurrence-only palette) and RUN exposure
We adopt the occurrence-only palette at clause S: ClauseSelect ∈ {O1,O2,O3}. The sign is read from the verified RUN.
- Clause RUN: Inside wc (clause side), a radius-1 tableau encodes U(C, GID=j), exposing at fixed offsets near the interface:
  - three B-bit binary indices (i1, i2, i3) and one-hot lanes Hot(i1), Hot(i2), Hot(i3),
  - three sign bits sgn1, sgn2, sgn3 ∈ {+,−}.
- Variable RUN (optional): Inside wb (variable side), expose RID in two redundant forms: B-bit binary RIDbits and a one-hot HotRID.
- Binding rule: If S carries Op, the only enabled clause-side pointer is to the p-th occurrence’s index bits ip and sign sgnp; other occurrence pointers are disabled locally by Cout–out. The variable-side S carries VarTruth ∈ {VT,VF}.
- Sign check: Under equality (see §3), the CAP conduit requires (VarTruth = VT if sgnp=+, else VarTruth = VF if sgnp=−). There is no way to route CAP if this check fails (no Cout–out entries for a mismatched sign at the CAP seam).
Why useful here: The clause cannot cheat on the sign; the only freedom at S is selecting which occurrence p to pick, and the sign is forced by RUN. This matches the intended “pick one literal among the three.”
How it can fail: If RUN could be inconsistent or if multiple occurrence pointers were simultaneously enabled, the clause could dodge constraints. The tableau tiles enforce a single, consistent set of outputs (nearest-neighbor TM transitions), and an error-chain path is available to refute any inconsistency, which automatically deactivates the seam (Neutral role).
Quick test: Clause j with occurrences (i1=3,+),(i2=7,−),(i3=10,+). With O2 at S and equality to RID=7, CAP requires VarTruth=VF. With VarTruth=VT, CAP is disabled and the bridge fails.

3) Equality vs inequality certificates: local invariants and exclusivity
We specify the witness chains and prove exclusivity.
- Tracks and anchors at AccVar (variable side):
  - Binary RIDbits[0..B−1]; One-hot HotRID[1..2^B]; a stable pointer origin PtrRID.
- Tracks and anchors at AccCla (clause side, after selecting p):
  - Binary ip_bits[0..B−1]; One-hot Hot(ip)[1..2^B]; sign sgnp; pointer origin Ptr(ip).
- Chain types and their first steps (must start at S with CertStart):
  - Equality chain Eq: deterministically iterates b=0..B−1; at each step reads (RIDbits[b], ip_bits[b]); local rule requires equality at that bit; if it holds, advance; if a mismatch occurs, the chain dead-ends (no accepting continuation). After b=B−1 succeeds, emit CAP-Enable.
  - Inequality chain Neq: nondeterministically chooses a bit index b (via a small unary counter subchain); then reads (RIDbits[b], ip_bits[b]); local rule requires inequality at that bit; if equal, the chain dead-ends. On success, emit PAD-Enable.
- Pointer integrity: From PtrRID to RIDbits[b] (resp. Ptr(ip) to ip_bits[b]) the chain carries a bit-selector subtrack sel(b) that is checked against a de Bruijn-like local addressing pattern baked into the block; any attempt to “fake” a bit value will contradict the address/bit consistency with an immediate local mismatch. Similarly, the one-hot tracks and the selected occurrence Hot(ip) tie the binary and one-hot encodings.
- Exclusivity Lemma (E): For any active ordered pair (AccVar,AccCla) with selection p, exactly one of Eq or Neq admits a complete witness chain.
  - Proof sketch: If RID = ip, then at every b we have RIDbits[b] = ip_bits[b]. Eq progresses through all b and reaches CAP-Enable; Neq cannot pick any b with differing bits, so it dead-ends immediately for all choices. If RID ≠ ip, then there exists some b with RIDbits[b] ≠ ip_bits[b]. Neq can choose such a b and succeed (PAD-Enable); Eq necessarily fails at the first mismatched b. Radius-1 ensures that each step checks only adjacent outputs; pointer integrity prevents inventing contradictory bit values.
- CAP/PAD propagation and mutual exclusion: Cout–out allows CAP to propagate only if CAP-Enable has been emitted (i.e., Eq has fully succeeded), and PAD to propagate only if PAD-Enable has been emitted (i.e., Neq has succeeded). No rule allows both CAP and PAD simultaneously; the start token CertStart has a one-of-two production that initiates either Eq or Neq but not both.
Why useful here: This yields the intended ON/OFF split: the unique variable whose RID equals the selected occurrence ip turns the pair ON (CAP), and all other variables are OFF (PAD). It also ensures that an adversarial filler cannot bypass the ON-case by choosing the inequality chain.
How it can fail: If bit addressing could be spoofed, the filler might fabricate a mismatch (or match). We design the address path to be self-consistent and locally validated (standard binary counter lane across the RID/ip blocks); the certificate must follow these lanes, and any deviation leads to missing Cout–out entries.
Quick test (B=3): RID=5 (101), ip=5 (101): Eq reads 1=1,0=0,1=1 and enables CAP; Neq can pick b=0,1,2 but all yield equal bits, so dead-end. With RID=6 (110), ip=5 (101): Eq fails at b=0; Neq can pick b=0 (0≠1) and succeed.

4) OFF neutrality and ON enforcement
- OFF pairs (RID ≠ ip): Neq yields PAD-Enable. The only permitted fill is the PAD conduit: a regular-language subgrammar that is oblivious to VarTruth and ClauseSelect and ignores CAP. Error-chain tokens are allowed along PAD, guaranteeing completion regardless of interior content. Thus OFF pairs do not constrain f.
- ON pairs (RID = ip): Only Eq yields CAP-Enable, and the CAP seam enforces the sign check VarTruth↔sgnp. If VarTruth disagrees with sgnp, Cout–out forbids completing the CAP conduit. There is no PAD path in this case (PAD-Enable is not emitted), so the bridge fails.
Why useful here: Exactly one constrained pair per clause selection p, and its success is equivalent to the chosen literal being true under α. All other pairs are tautologies.
How it can fail: If PAD were allowed in ON pairs, constraints would be vacuous. This cannot happen because PAD-Enable is only produced by a successful Neq, which is impossible when RID=ip.
Quick test: Clause j selects O3 with ip=10 and sgn3=+. For pair (Var_10, Cl_j), ON requires VT. For (Var_11, Cl_j), OFF PAD completes trivially.

5) Type separation and availability at scale
Claim TS (Type separation and coverage). There exist 2^B distinct variable context types Var_i and 2^B distinct clause context types Cl_j realized by contexts with |w1|,|w2| ∈ {ℓ_pump, ℓ_pump+1}. Moreover, Var_i ≠ Var_{i′} for i ≠ i′ and Cl_j ≠ Cl_{j′}.
- Coverage: The block footprints (HEAD, RID/GID, RUN anchors) occupy poly(s) cells, while ℓ_pump = 2^{Θ(β^4)} = 2^{poly(s)}. Pumping and replacement allow placing these blocks adjacent to S inside wb/wc while keeping the overall type well-defined (§4, Lemmas 11–15 of the reference).
- Separation (variables): Fix any clause-type Cl_j that selects O1 with ip=i and is otherwise well-formed. For the ordered pairs (Var_i, Cl_j) and (Var_{i′}, Cl_j) with i′≠i, their boundary-extendibility signatures differ under S labels (VT vs VF) because the former admits a CAP (if the sign check is met) and the latter admits only PAD. Hence the types Var_i and Var_{i′} differ. If C does not produce such a j for some i, add a tester j⋆ in the construction with a hard-wired clause whose first occurrence equals i (validated by the same tableau), ensuring separation without relying on C’s structure.
- Separation (clauses): Symmetrically, fix a Var_i and compare Cl_j vs Cl_{j′} by picking selections that include i versus exclude i; their extendibility behavior under a fixed VarTruth differs (ON vs OFF), hence types differ.
Why useful here: Ensures we have enough active types to encode all variables and clauses, and that choices of f over these types correspond to α and clause literal picks.
How it can fail: If Acc● could be placed without the interior RUN/RID content, types might collapse. Our grammar ties Acc● to valid interior content (or to an error-chain that deactivates the seam), preventing spurious activation.
Quick test: Build two clause types Cl_j (with i in its triple) and Cl_{j′} (without i). Pair each with Var_i and set S to select the occurrence containing i: (Var_i, Cl_j) is ON; (Var_i, Cl_{j′}) is OFF. Types differ.

6) Correctness of the reduction (FFE(F1)) with the patched seam and certificates
- Completeness: Given a satisfying assignment α, define f(Var_i) = VT if α(x_i)=1 else VF; define f(Cl_j) = Op selecting any true literal p in clause(j). For any ordered pair, if it is OFF, PAD completes; if it is the ON pair (RID=ip), the Eq certificate emits CAP and the sign check is satisfied by our choice, so the bridge completes.
- Soundness: Suppose f satisfies (F1). Read α from variable types (VT/VF). For each j, O_p must be such that the ON pair (Var_{ip}, Cl_j) completes; otherwise the bridge would fail (no PAD in the equality case). Hence the selected literal is true under α, and all clauses are satisfied.
- Inactive contexts: By the seam rules, any non-⊥ at S is rejected unless the neighbor is Acc●, so f must set ⊥ on inactive types; conversely ⊥ always completes via PAD. Thus inactive contexts impose no constraints.
- No trivialization via ⊥: On active seams, ⊥ at S is locally rejected; hence f cannot trivialize (F1) by using ⊥.
Why useful here: These arguments, now anchored in explicit seam rules and exclusive certificates, close the two key soundness/completeness gaps under the β-normalized, radius-1 model.
How it can fail: If PAD were allowed adjacent to S under non-⊥, an adversary could bypass ON. Our seam+certificate rules forbid PAD unless Neq succeeds (RID≠ip), eliminating this loophole.
Quick test (B=2 worked micro-instance): Variables {x1..x4}, clause j with (x3 ∨ ¬x1 ∨ x4). If α=(x1=0,x3=1,x4=0), set f(Var_3)=VT, f(Cl_j)=O1; only (Var_3, Cl_j) is ON and succeeds; (Var_1, Cl_j),(Var_4, Cl_j) are OFF and PAD-fillable; all other ordered pairs trivial.

7) Size, radius, and locality checks
- Radius-1: All checks are between adjacent nodes: seam handshakes, certificate steps (bit-by-bit compare along pointer lanes), CAP/PAD conduits, and RUN row transitions.
- Alphabet size β: Constant-number of role/phase/handshake tokens; equality/inequality chains add O(1) symbols; RID/GID/RUN alphabets are poly(s); overall |Σ_out| = β = poly(s).
- Type count: ℓ_pump ≤ 2^{Θ(β^4)} = 2^{poly(s)}; enough to realize 2^B active types.
- Error-chains: As in the reference §3, malformed headers or inconsistent RUN rows are locally refutable and lead to Neutral seams (allowing ⊥/PAD), never to Acc●.

8) Why we do not trivialize (F2) here
To avoid the pitfall identified by the verifier (⊥ at S trivializing (F1)), we keep (F2) as in the reference (finite z checks in the upper bound) and prove NEXPTIME-hardness for FFE(F1). This already implies NEXPTIME-hardness for the three-way classification (the algorithm must distinguish at least between Θ(log* n) and Θ(n) on our family).

What changed/was fixed this round (vs. Round 0002)
- Added explicit seam rules forbidding ⊥ at S on active seams and forcing CertStart.
- Adopted occurrence-only clause palette; bound the sign to RUN; eliminated any opportunity to choose a sign at S.
- Stated and justified the exclusivity lemma for equality vs inequality witnesses, with local invariants (pointer integrity, bit checks) and mutual exclusion of CAP/PAD.
- Clarified OFF neutrality and ON enforcement via CAP/PAD-Enable gates.
- Provided a robust type-separation argument with an optional tester clause j⋆ for worst-case C.

Open items and next steps
- Write a concrete micro-table for the seam edges (enumerate Cout–out entries for pairs among {AccVar,AccCla,Neutral}×{VT,VF,O1,O2,O3,⊥,CertStart,CAP,PAD}).
- Spell out the de Bruijn-like addressing and the exact pointer tiles from PtrRID/Ptr(ip) to RIDbits[b]/ip_bits[b]; prove that any deviation is caught in ≤2 local steps.
- Produce an explicit RUN tile set for U with fixed phases and the exposure of (i1,i2,i3) and (sgn1,sgn2,sgn3); include the error-chain tiles and show bounded local refutations for all malformed patterns.
- Work out the full B=2 DP table on 12 ordered pairs to sanity-check exclusivity, sign binding, OFF neutrality, and active-⊥ forbiddance.

## Round 0003 — 2025-08-27T11:30:44.028451Z

Mini-plan
- Pin down the S-seam gadget: explicit tokens and two families of edge rules that (i) forbid ⊥ at S on active contexts and (ii) allow PAD on inactive ones. Make activation depend only on a constant-size input code around S so it is type-local and radius-1 enforceable.
- Prove Exclusivity Lemma for equality/inequality witnesses: give the invariant (one-hot RID, binary ip, integrity of pointers), and the per-bit comparator tiles so exactly one certificate is realizable.
- Bind sign to RUN and avoid clause-side sign cheats: use S palette {O1,O2,O3} only; the selected occurrence’s sign is exported from RUN into the ON check.
- Show OFF pairs and inactive contexts are neutral: they always have a PAD/⊥ completion and impose no constraints on f.
- Address (F2): argue that our bridge interacts only with the nearest blocks; repetitions add disjoint, self-satisfying structure, hence for our family (F2) holds automatically once (F1) does. Give a local “barrier” that cuts witness chains at one block away from S.
- Validate with a B=2 toy: list the S-seam tokens on the four seam-adjacent nodes, simulate the witness chain on one ON and one OFF pair, and show ⊥ at S is rejected only in active contexts.

1) S-seam gadget with input-coded activation (explicit tokens and local rules)
Definition (tokens and code).
- S tokens: ΣS = {⊥, O1, O2, O3} (occurrence-only palette).
- Left seam-adjacent node uL (immediately left of the left S node) and right seam-adjacent node vR (immediately right of the right S node) carry special seam-interface roles:
  - DoorVar on uL when left side is variable-active; DoorPAD otherwise.
  - DoorCl on vR when right side is clause-active; DoorPAD otherwise.
- Activation code (input-only): we reserve a 2-bit code on each of uL and vR using the node’s own input bit and its predecessor’s input bit (both are available in the two-node S-window contexts). Concretely, we treat the input bit of uL, vR and the bit of their predecessor as “flags” that Cin–out checks to gate the role subtrack:
  - Code 10 on uL (meaning: pred(uL).in=1, uL.in=0) enables only DoorVar; all other outputs at uL are forbidden by Cin–out.
  - Code 01 on vR (meaning: pred(vR).in=0, vR.in=1) enables only DoorCl; all other outputs at vR are forbidden by Cin–out.
  - Any other code enables only DoorPAD at that node.
- Seam edges (Cout–out) enforce:
  - (DoorVar) — (O1|O2|O3) allowed; (DoorVar) — (⊥) forbidden.
  - (O1|O2|O3) — (DoorCl) allowed; (⊥) — (DoorCl) forbidden.
  - (DoorPAD) — (any S token) allowed; (any S token) — (DoorPAD) allowed (inactive side is neutral at seam).
- Inside the left/right blocks (wb/wc), Cout–out enforces a unique expansion from DoorVar/DoorCl: they must start a well-formed block of the designated role (variable/clause) with header HEADC (fixed), RID/GID segments, and RUN tableau (Section 3 recipe). DoorPAD starts a locally consistent PAD sublanguage independent of S.
Why useful here: This forces non-⊥ at S when both sides exhibit the activation code (active context), while keeping inactive contexts neutral: DoorPAD tolerates any S token including ⊥. Activation depends only on constant many nearby input bits and radius-1 seam edges.
How it can fail:
- If the activation code cannot be recognized with r=1, we would leak to nonlocal checks. Here we use only the node’s own input and its predecessor’s input, which Cin–out can gate (per-node pair check), and seam edges are between neighbors.
- If the DP can avoid DoorVar/DoorCl by choosing other outputs: forbidden by Cin–out under the 10/01 codes (they make DoorVar/DoorCl the only legal outputs on those nodes).
Quick test (hand check): choose inputs so that pred(uL).in=1, uL.in=0, pred(vR).in=0, vR.in=1; then uL must output DoorVar, vR must output DoorCl by Cin–out; hence S=⊥ fails at both seam edges. Flip any one flag (e.g., pred(uL).in:=0): Cin–out now allows only DoorPAD at uL; S=⊥ is accepted at that seam.

2) Equality/inequality witness exclusivity (radius-1 certificates)
Claim E (Exclusivity of equality vs inequality certificates). In an active pair where DoorVar (left) and DoorCl (right) start well-formed blocks, and S is O_p selecting occurrence p, exactly one of the following radius-1 witness chains is realizable:
- Equality chain: follows a pointer from S to the clause’s index ip (in binary lanes b=1..B), and from DoorVar to the RID index iL (HotRID one-hot and its binary), and steps bit-by-bit along both binary representations enforcing equality at each bit; only if all bits match does the chain reach a CAP emitter that allows CAP propagation across S. Any mismatch yields a dead end.
- Inequality chain: guesses a bit position b via a bounded fan-out chain from S, steps to the b-th bit lane on both sides, and demands a local mismatch predicate (RID[b] ≠ ip[b]) to reach a PAD emitter that forbids CAP and completes with PAD.
Invariant and tiles:
- Integrity: RID has a one-hot encoding HotRID; its binary RID[b] is also exported on B lanes with local equality between the one-hot position and the binary value; similarly ip has binary lanes exported by RUN. Local Cout–out tiles enforce these equalities and ensure uniqueness.
- Comparator tiles:
  - Equality tile for bit b: requires RID[b]=ip[b], else no outgoing edge.
  - Inequality tile for bit b: requires RID[b]≠ip[b], else no outgoing edge.
- Chain structure: both chains are simple nearest-neighbor cursors. Equality must visit all B bit lanes (fixed-length path) and only then may emit CAP; inequality visits a chosen b and only emits PAD if mismatch holds.
Why useful here: It ensures per (Var_i, Cl_j, O_p) exactly one bridge semantics applies: ON (CAP) if i=ip, OFF (PAD) otherwise. This gives the “one constrained pair per clause pick.”
How it can fail:
- Faking mismatch when equal: impossible because the inequality tile for bit b has no legal continuation if RID[b]=ip[b].
- Faking equality when different: the equality chain stalls at the first b with RID[b]≠ip[b]. There is no alternate bypass due to the uniqueness of the cursor track enforced by Cout–out.
Quick test (B=3): RID=101 (5), ip=111 (7). Equality chain: at b=2 sees 0 vs 1 → dead end. Inequality chain: pick b=2, demands 0≠1 → succeeds; emits PAD.

3) Sign binding via occurrence-only S palette
Claim S (Occurrence-only selection; sign tied to RUN). The clause-side RUN computes for j=GID: three indices (i1,i2,i3) and their signs (sgn1,sgn2,sgn3), exposing binary lanes for indices and one-bit signs per occurrence. The S palette is ΣS={O1,O2,O3}. If S=Op, the equality chain uses ip and the ON-bridge demands VT iff sgnp=+ and VF iff sgnp=− (VT/VF are the two variable-side colors). No sign appears in S;
Cout–out contains local tiles that read sgnp from RUN at the end of the equality chain to gate the CAP emitter (mismatch of variable color vs sgnp blocks CAP).
Why useful here: Prevents “sign cheating” at S and collapses the clause pick to the intended occurrence choice; the sign is immutable (verified by the tableau) and locally read.
How it can fail:
- If RUN could expose multiple inconsistent signs: disallowed by the tableau consistency and single-row export; inconsistencies are locally refuted (error chain), which deactivates the context (only DoorPAD remains legal at the seam via Cin–out code mismatch).
- If S could carry sign: by construction it does not; ΣS lacks sign tokens.
Quick test: Clause j encodes (x3, ¬x7, x10). S=O2; equality O2 with Var_7 succeeds only if left S color is VF; with Var_7 color VT, the CAP gate blocks.

4) OFF pairs and inactive contexts are neutral
Claim N (Neutrality). For any ordered pair where either (i) the activation code does not hold on at least one side (so that side is DoorPAD), or (ii) S=Op but iL≠ip (inequality), or (iii) roles are not (variable, clause), there exists a PAD-only completion independent of f’s other choices. This is implemented by:
- DoorPAD forcing a PAD sublanguage chunk adjacent to S that is seam-compatible with any S token; the remainder of wb/wc can be filled with PAD or well-formed blocks that terminate internally (no CAP).
- Inequality chain emission of PAD, which is the only admissible completion when iL≠ip.
Why useful here: This eliminates spurious constraints from nonselected pairs and from inputs lacking activation codes. Only ON cases constrain f.
How it can fail:
- If PAD conflicts with nearby mandatory block starts: prevented by using Cin–out to permit only DoorPAD (not DoorVar/Cl) when activation code is absent; the PAD language is self-contained and seam-compatible.
- If PAD could carry CAP: prohibited; PAD emitters never produce CAP and Cout–out forbids CAP adjacency except from the equality chain’s emitter.
Quick test: Left inactive (DoorPAD), right active (DoorCl), S arbitrary. The seam edges accept; both wb and wc can be filled by PAD (on left) and a proper block (on right) whose “barriers” (see next claim) absorb internally; DP succeeds.

5) Bridging (F2) holds automatically for our family
Claim B (Nearest-block locality; barriers cut repetition). For any context (w1, S, w2) activated on both sides, and any z≥1, the repeated bridge wz_1 S wz_2 has a completion whenever the base bridge w1 S w2 has one. Reason: the only interactions with S are (a) the seam edges DoorVar/Cl — S and (b) the equality/inequality witness chains, both of which operate exclusively within the nearest blocks contiguous to S, terminated by a local “barrier” token one node beyond the RUN footer that refuses witness cursors. Blocks beyond the nearest ones are separated by barriers and have an internal “sink” completion (PAD-neutral endcaps). Therefore, adding extra copies of w1 or w2 does not introduce any additional seam constraints; all seams between adjacent copies are block-internal and satisfy Cout–out by the block grammar.
Why useful here: We avoid the need to trivialize (F2) via ⊥. With barriers, (F2) is independent of z and thus holds iff the base ON/OFF semantics allow the nearest left/right blocks.
How it can fail:
- If witness chains could jump barriers: prevented by local tiles that forbid the cursor token from crossing the barrier symbols.
- If blocks required cross-copy synchronization: they do not; RUN is self-contained per block and Cout–out only relates neighbors;
repeated copies simply obey the same tiles.
Quick test: Evaluate w1 S w2 with S=O2, success on equality → CAP. Now consider w1^5 S w2^7. The nearest copies to S are identical; their barriers stop any further traversal; the rest can be tiled independently. DP outcome identical.

6) B=2 toy worked seam and bridge
Setup: B=2 so variables x0..x3; pick clause j with (i1=01:+), (i2=10:−), (i3=11:+). Choose inputs around S to encode activation code 10 at uL and 01 at vR, hence Cin–out forces DoorVar at uL and DoorCl at vR.
- Pair (Var_10, Cl_j, S=O2): Equality path: RID=10, ip=10 → equality passes; RUN exposes sgn2=−; CAP emitter requires left S color VF; if we set left S color VF, CAP propagates and DP completes; if VT, the CAP gate blocks and DP fails. Inequality path is blocked since all bits equal.
- Pair (Var_01, Cl_j, S=O2): RID=01, ip=10 differ at b=1; equality chain stalls at b=1; inequality chain pins b=1 and succeeds, emits PAD; DP completes with PAD plumbing and no CAP dependency.
- ⊥ at S: With activation code present, uL is DoorVar and vR is DoorCl, and (DoorVar,⊥) or (⊥,DoorCl) are forbidden at both seam edges; hence DP fails. Remove activation on left (flip pred(uL).in), DoorPAD appears; (DoorPAD,⊥) allowed, DP succeeds.

7) Soundness/completeness of the succinct-SAT reduction (recap under the patched gadget)
- Variables: for each active Var_i type, f(Var_i) ∈ {VT,VF} encodes α(x_i).
- Clauses: for each active Cl_j type, f(Cl_j) ∈ {O1,O2,O3} selects an occurrence p.
- Constraints: by Claim E and S, the only nontrivial bridge per j is with (Var_{i_p}, Cl_j, S=Op), which succeeds iff α(x_{i_p}) matches sgn_p. All other ordered pairs are neutral by Claim N.
- Therefore, (F1) holds iff there exist α and picks p_j such that each clause has a satisfied literal: exactly Succinct-3SAT for C.
- By Claim B, (F2) holds automatically for our family (nearest-block locality with barriers), ensuring that if (F1) holds then f is fully feasible (O(1) side); if (F1) fails then by Theorem 8 (reference) the complexity is Θ(n), giving the desired O(1) vs Θ(n) dichotomy on our instances.

What changed vs previous round (addressing verifier’s gaps)
- Forbid ⊥ at S on active contexts: implemented by Cin–out seam code (10 at uL, 01 at vR) forcing DoorVar/DoorCl and Cout–out disallowing ⊥ adjacent to those. Inactive contexts (other codes) get DoorPAD and remain neutral.
- Sign bound to RUN: S palette is occurrence-only; sign is read from RUN in the equality chain’s CAP gate.
- Exclusivity: Equality/inequality witnesses are backed by explicit per-bit tiles and cursor tracks with one-hot and binary consistency; we argued both directions cannot succeed simultaneously.
- (F2) no longer “trivialized by ⊥”: instead, we ensure bridge locality and add block-internal barriers so repetitions do not affect the S-bridge. This preserves nontriviality of (F1) while still making (F2) automatically hold for our reduction family.

Open edge cases and quick counterexample probes
- Could DP choose to label an active-coded seam node (code 10/01) with DoorPAD to allow ⊥? No: Cin–out at those nodes only permits DoorVar/DoorCl under that code.
- Could DP avoid blocks behind DoorVar/DoorCl? No: Cout–out enforces a unique expansion starting from DoorVar/DoorCl into a well-formed block prefix; deviations are locally rejected.
- Could extra copies in wz_1,wz_2 inject an unexpected ON? No: barriers forbid cursor tokens from crossing block boundaries beyond the nearest; only the nearest block talks to S.

Summary impact
- We now have a radius-1, β-normalized seam and bridge specification that (i) activates constraints precisely where intended, (ii) forbids ⊥ at S on active contexts, (iii) ties sign to RUN, (iv) grants exclusivity of equality/inequality witnesses, (v) renders (F2) independent of z via nearest-block locality and barriers.
- The reduction to Succinct-3SAT remains intact and cleaner: the implicit exponential SAT constraints are exactly of the form “if S picks Op then Var_{i_p} must have color matching sgn_p”, with all other pairs neutral.

## round-0001 — model summary — 2025-08-26T19:12:15.171929Z
In this round, the prover outlined a structured mini-plan to tackle the complexities of LCLs and their hardness classifications. Key areas of focus include a thorough understanding of the PSPACE-hardness proof, careful analysis of a proposed NEXPTIME algorithm, and the exploration of reductions from known NEXPTIME-hard problems. The prover emphasized the importance of systematic exploration of LCL cases and the formulation of lemmas regarding the relationship between local complexity and the size of $\beta$. However, the verifier noted that while the plan is well-structured, it requires deeper analysis and caution against misinterpretations and generalizations. The overall verdict remains uncertain, indicating that further refinement and validation are necessary.

## round-0001 — model summary — 2025-08-27T10:53:03.559489Z
Round snapshot: two prover sketches plus verifier feedback. Prover-01 proposed a window-anchored activation fix (place RID/GID and HEAD/RUN inside wb/wc) and pumping-based existence of many active types; it also argued inactive contexts can be neutralized with ⊥ and that (F2) can be trivialized by ⊥-plumbing. Prover-02 introduced a gated-bridge gadget that turns ON only for intended (VAR_i, CLA_j) ordered pairs (forcing CAP propagation when i ∈ vars(j)), plus two finite-check lemmas (finite-z periodicity for (F2) and a layered radius-1 DP for extendibility in O(k·β^2)). The verifier endorsed combining gating with window-anchoring but flagged two untenable claims (deriving 2^B types from only 2 boundary nodes; O(1) local clause-triple validation) and requested explicit C_in–out/C_out–out tables for the four boundary nodes and conduits, a formal type-separation lemma, and a poly(s)-length clause-decoder tableau. Verdict: uncertain. Citations: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json, Verifier (summary_md).

## round-0002 — model summary — 2025-08-27T11:30:43.966675Z
Round 0002 completed a focused repair and formalization of the reduction from Succinct-3SAT to feasible-function existence for β-normalized, r=1 LCLs. Core moves: recast (F1) as an implicit exponential SAT over type-choices; replace the previous gate with an equality/inequality witness gate so each clause-side pick activates exactly one variable-side pair; implement clause decoding as a poly(s)-length, radius-1 tableau that exposes (i1,i2,i3) and signs and yields local error-chain refuters for malformed runs; show existence and separability of 2^B variable- and clause-types via window-anchored blocks and differential extendibility; and trivialize (F2) via ⊥-plumbing so the classification reduces to (F1). Together these yield an implicit CNF (Horn-style clauses (¬Y ∨ X)) equivalent to the succinct 3CNF, giving the intended NEXPTIME hardness direction. Remaining concrete artifacts are explicit seam tables, the RUN tile set, a radius-1 exclusivity proof for equality vs inequality certificates, and a full B=2 DP worked example.

## round-0003 — model summary — 2025-08-27T11:44:17.213609Z
Round 0003 produced a converging patch that (a) enforces active seams so ⊥ at S is forbidden in active contexts, (b) restricts the clause S-palette to occurrences {O1,O2,O3} and binds signs to the verified RUN, and (c) implements a radius‑1 Exclusivity Lemma for equality vs. inequality witness chains. Two complementary seam designs were presented (input-coded DoorVar/DoorCl/DoorPAD and Offer/NoOffer); nearest‑block barriers (preferred by the verifier) or a RepeatPAD pattern were proposed to make (F2) hold without trivializing (F1). Core invariants are one‑hot RID, redundant binary lanes, pointer‑integrity tiles, and a monotone eq_so_far/neq mode that gates CAP vs PAD. B=2 toy traces were sketched to sanity‑check ON/OFF cases. Outstanding concrete artifacts requested by the verifier: explicit Cout/Cin seam tables, de Bruijn‑style pointer tiles, a RUN tile set, and a full 12‑node B=2 DP trace.

- Adopt a hybrid: use Prover 02’s gate to separate ON (i∈vars(j)) from OFF pairs, and Prover 01’s window-anchored blocks to keep all semantics within wb/wc.
- Replace any O(1)-time checker with a poly(s)-length, radius-1 tableau inside wc (and wb as needed) that verifies C(j) and exposes the needed bits to the gate; ensure error-chain refutations for malformed headers.
- Do not rely on boundary-only signatures for type multiplicity; instead, separate types by differential boundary-extendibility induced by interior content (witness success/failure under fixed S-labels).
- Action items: (i) write explicit boundary tables (offers, gate, PAD/CAP conduits), (ii) specify the clause-verification tableau and its alphabet, (iii) prove type-separation and OFF/ON correctness, (iv) complete a B=2 worked example with DP simulation.
Verifier notes addendum (2025-08-27):
- Critical: Forbid ⊥ at S on active contexts. Adjust Cout–out so that when the window anchors a well-formed variable/clause block, the S palette excludes ⊥ and forces an offer; only inactive contexts allow ⊥. This preserves nontriviality of (F1).
- Adopt Prover 01’s occurrence-only S palette {O1,O2,O3}; read the sign from the verified RUN. If using sign-coded S tokens, add a local rule that forces the S-sign to equal the RUN’s sign for the selected occurrence.
- Gate exclusivity: Write and prove a radius-1 lemma that exactly one of equality/inequality certificates is realizable, with CAP allowed only under equality and PAD only under inequality.
- Type separation: Prefer a neutral tester j* (present as a type but labelable so it imposes no constraints under f) to guarantee distinct Var_i without relying on properties of C. Validate no side effects on (F1) or (F2).
- Proceed with explicit seam tables (offers, gate, CAP/PAD), the clause RUN tiles and error chains, and the B=2 worked DP table.
Verifier notes (addendum 2025-08-27, PM):
- Adopt two S-side palettes: S1 (variable side) ∈ {VT,VF,⊥}, S2 (clause side) ∈ {O1,O2,O3,⊥}. Forbid ⊥ at S1/S2 when the adjacent neighbor emits Offer; allow ⊥ only when the neighbor is Neutral/NoOffer.
- Prefer P02’s Offer/NoOffer seam grammar (CertStart, CAP/PAD conduits) and P01’s nearest-block barrier to make F2 automatic without trivializing F1. Barriers must stop all witness/cursor tokens and be placed exactly one node past RUN footers.
- Eq/Neq exclusivity: implement eq_so_far or per-bit comparator tiles with pointer-integrity tying HotRID↔RIDbits and Selected(ip)↔RUN. CAP only after full Eq; PAD only after Neq mismatch.
- Do not introduce a tester clause j* unless neutrality in F1 is proven. Aim to separate types via clauses from C or via internal extendibility masks.
- Activation-by-input (if used) must be radius-1: forward predecessor input locally or avoid using it.
- Action: write explicit seam tables; list barrier tokens/tiles; provide a B=2 DP walk for one ON and one OFF pair.

Abstract. Consider a computer network that consists of a path with n nodes. The
nodes are labeled with inputs from a constant-sized set, and the task is to ﬁnd output
labels from a constant-sized set subject to some local constraints—more formally, we
have an LCL (locally checkable labeling) problem. How many communication rounds
are needed (in the standard LOCAL model of computing) to solve this problem?
It is well known that the answer is always either O(1) rounds, or Θ(log∗n) rounds,
or Θ(n) rounds. In this work we show that this question is decidable (albeit PSPACE-
hard): we present an algorithm that, given any LCL problem deﬁned on a path,
outputs the distributed computational complexity of this problem and the corresponding
asymptotically optimal algorithm.

Introduction
To what extent is it possible to automate the design of algorithms and the study of computational
complexity? While algorithm synthesis problems are typically undecidable, there are areas of
theoretical computer science in which we can make use of computational techniques in algorithm
design—at least in principle, and sometimes also in practice. One such area is the theory of
distributed computing; see [3, 5, 6, 9, 11, 17, 19, 26] for examples of recent success stories. In this
work we bring yet another piece of good news:
Consider this setting: there is a computer network that consists of a path with n nodes, the
nodes are labeled with inputs from a constant-sized set, and the task is to ﬁnd output labels from
a constant-sized set subject to some local constraints. We show that for any given set of local
constraints, it is decidable to tell what is the asymptotically optimal number of communication
rounds needed to solve this problem (as a function of n, for the worst-case input).
Background: LCLs and the LOCAL Model.
We focus on what are known as LCL (locally
checkable labeling) problems [22] in the LOCAL model of distributed computing [20, 24]. We deﬁne
the setting formally in Section 2, but in essence we look at the following question:
• We are given an unknown input graph of maximum degree ∆= O(1); the nodes are labeled
with input labels from a constant-size set Σin, and the nodes also have unique identiﬁers from
a polynomially-sized set.
• The task is to label the nodes with output labels from a constant-size set Σout, subject to
some local constraints P; a labeling is globally feasible if it is locally feasible in all radius-r
neighborhoods for some r = O(1).
• Each node has to produce its own output label based on the information that it sees in its
own radius-T(n) neighborhoods for some function T.
Here the local constraints P deﬁne an LCL problem. The rule that the nodes apply to determine
their output labels is called a distributed algorithm in the LOCAL model, and function T(n) is the
running time of the algorithm—here T(n) determines how far a node has to see in order to choose
its own part of the solution, or equivalently, how many communication rounds are needed for each
node to gather the relevant information if we view the input graph as a communication network.
In this setting, the case of T(n) = Θ(n) is trivial, as all nodes can see the entire input. The
key question is to determine which problems P can be solved in sublinear time—here are some
examples:
• Vertex coloring with ∆+ 1 colors: can be solved in time O(log∗n) [8, 16] and this is tight
[20, 21].
• Vertex coloring with ∆colors, for ∆> 2: can be solved in polylogarithmic time [23] and
requires at least logarithmic time [7] for deterministic algorithms.
While the study of this setting was initiated already in the seminal work by Naor and Stockmeyer
in 1995 [22], our understanding of these questions has rapidly advanced in the past three years
[1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 12–15, 25]. The big surprises have been these:
1

--- Page 3 ---
• There are LCL problems with inﬁnitely many diﬀerent time complexities—for example, we
can construct LCL problems with a time complexity exactly Θ(nα) for any rational number
0 < α ≤1.
• Nevertheless, there are also wide gaps in the complexity landscape: for example, no LCL
problem has a (deterministic) computational complexity that is between ω(log∗n) and o(log n).
However, what is perhaps most relevant for us is the following observation: if we look at the case
of ∆= 2 (paths and cycles), then the time complexity of any LCL problem is either O(1), Θ(log∗n),
or Θ(n), and the same holds for both deterministic and randomized algorithms [5, 6, 22].
Decidability of LCL Time Complexities.
For a ﬁxed ∆, any LCL problem has a trivial ﬁnite
representation: simply enumerate all feasible radius-r local neighborhoods. Hence it makes sense to
ask whether, given an LCL problem, it is possible to determine its time complexity. The following
results are known by prior work:
• If the input graph is an unlabeled path or cycle, the time complexity is decidable [5, 22].
• If the input graph is a grid or toroidal grid, the time complexity is undecidable [22]. However,
there are also some good news: in unlabeled toroidal grids, the time complexity falls in one of
the classes O(1), Θ(log∗n), or Θ(n), it is trivial to tell if the time complexity is O(1), and it
is semi-decidable to tell if it is Θ(log∗n) [5].
• In the case of trees, there are inﬁnitely many diﬀerent time complexities, but there is a gap
between ω(log n) and no(1), and it is decidable to tell on which side of the gap a given problem
lies [6].
Somewhat surprisingly, the seemingly simple case of labeled paths or cycles has remained open all
the way since the 1995 paper by Naor and Stockmeyer [22], which deﬁned LCLs with inputs but
analyzed decidability questions only in the case of unlabeled graphs.
We initially expected that the question of paths with input labels is a mere technicality and the
interesting open questions are related to much broader graph families, such as rooted trees, trees,
and bounded-treewidth graphs. However, it turned out that the main obstacle for understanding
decidability in any such graph family seems to lie in the fact that the structure of the graph can be
used to encode arbitrary input labels, hence it is necessary to ﬁrst understand how the input labels
inﬂuence decidability—and it turns out that this makes all the diﬀerence in the case of paths.
In this work we show that the time complexity of a given LCL problem on labeled paths or
cycles is decidable. However, we also show that decidability is far from trivial: the problem is
PSPACE-hard, as LCL problems on labeled paths are expressive enough to capture linear bounded
automata (Turing machines with bounded tapes).

Model
The LOCAL Model.
The model of computation we consider in this work is the LOCAL model of
distributed computing [20, 24]. In the LOCAL model, each node of the input graph is considered as
a computational entity that can communicate with the neighboring nodes in order to solve some
given graph problem. Computation is divided into synchronous rounds, where in each round each
node ﬁrst sends messages of arbitrary size to its neighbors, then receives the messages sent by
its neighbors, and ﬁnally performs some local computation of arbitrary complexity. Each node is
equipped with a globally unique identiﬁer (ID) which is simply a bit string of length O(log n), where
2

--- Page 4 ---
n denotes the number of nodes of the input graph. In the beginning of the computation, each node
is aware of its own ID, the number of nodes and the maximum degree ∆of the input graph, and
potentially some additional problem-speciﬁc input. Each node has to decide at some point that it
terminates, upon which it returns a local output and does not take part in any further computation;
the problem is solved correctly if the local outputs of all nodes together constitute a global output
that satisﬁes the output constraints of the given problem.
Each node executes the same algorithm; the running time of the distributed algorithm is the
number of rounds until the last node terminates. It is well known that, due to the unbounded
message sizes, an algorithm with runtime T(n) can be equivalently described as a function from
the set of all possible radius-T(n) neighborhoods to the set of allowed outputs. In other words, we
can assume that in a T(n)-round algorithm, each node ﬁrst gathers the topology of and the input
labels contained in its radius-T(n) neighborhood, and then decides on its output based solely on
the collected information.
Locally Checkable Labelings.
The class of problems we consider is locally checkable labeling
(LCL) problems [22]. LCL problems are deﬁned on graphs of bounded degree, i.e., we will assume
that ∆= O(1). Formally, an LCL problem is given by a ﬁnite input label set Σin, a ﬁnite output
label set Σout, an integer r, and a ﬁnite set C of graphs where every node is labeled with a pair
(ℓin, ℓout) ∈Σin × Σout and one node is marked (as the center). Each node of the input graph
is assigned an input label from Σin before the computation begins, and the global output of a
distributed algorithm is correct if the radius-r neighborhood of each node v, including the input
labels given to the contained nodes and the output labels returned by the contained nodes, is
isomorphic to an element of C where v corresponds to the node marked as the center.
In the case of directed paths as our class of input graphs, we are interested in identifying the
simplest possible form of LCL problems. For this purpose, we deﬁne β-normalized LCLs; these are
problems for which the input is just binary, and the size of the set of output labels is β. Moreover, the
solution can be checked at each node v by just inspecting the input and output of v, and, separately,
the output of v and the output of its predecessor. More formally, a β-normalized LCL problem is
given by ﬁnite input and output label sets Σin, Σout satisfying |Σin| = 2, |Σout| = β, a ﬁnite set
Cin −out of pairs (ℓin, ℓout) ∈Σin × Σout and a ﬁnite set Cout −out of pairs (ℓout, ℓ′
out) ∈Σout × Σout.
The global output of a distributed algorithm for the β-normalized LCL problem is correct if the
following hold:
• For each node v, we have (Input(v), Output(v)) ∈Cin −out, where Input(v) denotes the input
label of v, and Output(v) the output label of v.
• For each node v that has a predecessor, we have (Output(v), Output(u)) ∈Cout −out, where u is
the predecessor of v, and Output(v), Output(u) are the output labels of v and u, respectively.
It is straightforward to check that a β-normalized LCL problem is indeed a special case of an LCL
problem where r = 1.

Hardness
In this section we study the hardness of determining the distributed complexity of LCLs on paths
and cycles with input labels. More precisely, we start by proving the existence of a family Π of
LCL problems for consistently globally oriented paths, such that, given an LCL problem in Π, it is
PSPACE-hard to decide if its distributed complexity is O(1) or Θ(n). Our main result shows the
following.

Figure 1: Illustration of a correct encoding of the execution of an LBA on a path; black nodes act as separators
between the encoding of two consecutive steps of the LBA; in the example, the LBA executes a unary counter.
It is PSPACE-hard to distinguish whether a given LCL problem P with input labels can be
solved in O(1) time or needs Ω(n) time on globally oriented path graphs.
The high level idea of the proof of the above result is as follows. We would like to encode the
execution of Turing machines as LCLs on consistently oriented paths, and then deﬁne some LCL for
which the complexity depends on the running time of the machine. This is fairly easy on oriented
grids, for example, where we can use one dimension of the grid as a tape, and the other dimension
as time. One may try to do the same on paths, by projecting everything on a single dimension,
concatenating the tape state of each step. Unfortunately, the obtained encoding is not locally
checkable, since the length of the tape may be non-constant. Hence, in order to guarantee the local
checkability, we should consider Turing machines having a tape of size at most B, where B is a
constant with respect to the number of nodes in the path where we want to encode its execution.
For this purpose, we consider Linear Bounded Automata (LBA) [18, p. 225]. An LBA is a Turing
machine that has a tape of size upper bounded by some B. We show that, if B is constant with
respect to the number of nodes in the path, we can then encode the execution of an LBA MB as
an LCL for directed paths. Moreover, we show that by seeing this encoding as a two party game
between a prover and a disprover, we can encode the execution of MB using labels of constant size
that do not depend on B, even in the case in which the LCL checkability radius is 1. If the execution
of MB is not correctly encoded in the input of the LCL, then we can disprove its correctness using
output labels of size O(B). Moreover, we ensure that, if the execution of MB is correctly encoded
in the input of the LCL, it is not possible to produce a correct proof of non-correctness. Then, in
order to obtain an LCL with a distributed complexity that depends on the execution time of MB,
we encode some secret input at the ﬁrst node of the path. We require then that all nodes involved
in a correct encoding must produce the same secret as output.
Figure 1 shows an example of an LBA that executes a unary counter, and its encoding as input
to nodes on a path. In this instance, all nodes must produce the symbol a as output. Figure 2 shows
an example of the wrong input (the tape has been copied incorrectly between two consecutive steps

of the LBA). In this case, nodes are allowed to produce a chain of errors. Diﬀerent types of errors
will be handled using diﬀerent types of error labels. In the example, all nodes that produce the
error chain, output E2, indicating an error of type 2. We will show that we need O(B) symbols to
handle all possible errors (including the case in which the input tape is too long, way more than B).
Also, it is necessary that all error chains that we allow as outputs must be locally checkable.
Another interesting problem is to identify, for an LCL that can be distributedly solved in constant
time, how big this constant can be. In particular, we ﬁrst focus on identifying the simplest possible
description of an LCL, and then, we provide a lower bound on the complexity of a constant time
LCL, as a function of the size of the LCL description. For this purpose, we consider β-normalized
LCLs, i.e., problems for which the input labeling is just binary and there are β possible output
labels. Also, the veriﬁer for these LCLs is the simplest possible: it can only check if the output of a
node is correct w.r.t. its input, and separately, if the output of a node is correct w.r.t. the output of
its predecessor. Therefore, we show how to convert an LCL to a β-normalized one by encoding the
input in binary (Figure 3 shows an example), and obtain the following result.
There are β-normalized LCLs that can be solved in constant time but the distributed time
complexity is 2Ω(β).
All results that we have been described so far apply to globally oriented paths. Nevertheless, we
show that ideas and techniques can be generalized to work on undirected path and cycles as well,
obtaining essentially the same results. Finally, we will show how to lift these results to trees without
input labels, proving the following result.
It is PSPACE-hard to distinguish whether a given LCL problem P without input labels can be
solved in O(1) time or needs Ω(n) time on trees with degree ∆= 3.

3.1
Linear Bounded Automata
A Linear Bounded Automata MB is a Turing Machine having a bounded tape of size at most B,
such that it is able to recognize the boundaries of the tape [18, p. 225]. More formally, we deﬁne an
LBA as a tuple of 5 elements M = (Q, q0, qf, Γ, δ), where
• Q is a ﬁnite set of states;
• q0 ∈Q is the initial state;
• qf ∈Q is the ﬁnal state;
• Γ is a ﬁnite set of tape alphabet symbols that contains integers 0, 1, and special symbols L
(left), and R (right);
• δ is the transition function, where δ: Q \ {qf} × Γ →Q × Γ × {−, ←, →}.
The tape of MB is initialized as follows:
• the ﬁrst cell is marked with the symbol L;
• the last cell is marked with the symbol R;
• all other cells contain an integer in {0, 1}.
An execution of an LBA is a sequence (stepi | i ∈{1, . . . , t}), where
• stepi = (statei, tapei, headi);
• statet = qf;
• δ(statei, tapei[headi]) = (statei+1, tapei+1[headi], ϵ), and headi+1 is
– headi −1 if ϵ is ←;
– headi if ϵ is −;
– headi + 1 if ϵ is →.
3.2
The LCL Problem
We deﬁne a family Π of LCLs, in which each problem ΠMB depends on the LBA MB. The general
idea is that the input of the LCL may encode the execution of an LBA MB. If it is the case, nodes
are required to solve a problem that requires a time proportional to the execution time of MB. On
the other hand, if it is not the case, nodes can produce an output that proves that this encoding is
wrong. In order to deﬁne valid LCLs, we consider the case where B = O(1), that is, the size of the
tape does not depend on the size of the distributed network.
3.2.1
Input Labels
We deﬁne the input labels of our LCL as follows:
• Start(φ), where φ ∈{a, b}, indicates a symbol that will be used as some kind of secret;
• Separator, a label that acts as a separator between two steps of MB;
• Tape(c, s, h) gives information about the tape and the state of MB, where the content c ∈
{0, 1, L, R}, the state s ∈Q, and the head h ∈{true, false};
• Empty, indicating an empty input.
Note that the size of the set of possible input labels does not depend on the size B of the tape.

3.2.2
Encoding an LBA on a Path
Suppose we have a consistent global orientation in the path P = (p0, p1, p2, . . . , pn−1). Let step =
 stepi = (statei, tapei, headi) | i ∈{1, . . . , t}

be the execution of the LBA MB starting from a tape
initialized with (L, 0, . . . , 0, R).
Deﬁnition 1. The input of the LCL is a good input if the ﬁrst node of the path has in input
Start(φ), where φ ∈{a, b}, and the rest of the path correctly encodes the execution of an LBA MB
initialized with (L, 0, . . . , 0, R) (see Figure 1). More precisely:
• Input(p0) = Start(φ);
• Input(p(i−1)(B+1)+1) = Separator for i ∈1, . . . , t;
• Input(p(i−1)(B+1)+1+j) = Tape(c, s, h) for i ∈1, . . . , t, j ∈{1, . . . , B}, where
– c = tapei[j];
– s = statei;
– h = true if headi = j, otherwise h = false;
• All other nodes have in input Empty.
3.2.3
Output Labels
The set of output labels is the following.
• Start(φ);
• Empty;
• Error: a generic error label;
• Error0(i) where 0 ≤i ≤B + 1: an error of type 0 indicating that the machine is not correctly
initialized;
• Error1(i), where 0 ≤i ≤B: an error of type 1 that we will use in the case where the size of
the tape is not correct, i.e., when the size of the tape is not B;
• Error2(x, i), where x ∈{0, 1, L, R} and 0 ≤i ≤B + 1: an error of type 2 used when the tape
of MB is wrongly copied;
• Error3: an error of type 3 is used in case nodes have inconsistent states;
• Error4(current state, tape content, i), where 0 ≤i ≤B + 2: an error of type 4 indicating that
the transition of MB is encoded incorrectly (this error captures also the case where the head
is missing);
• Error5(x) where x ∈{0, 1}: an error of type 5 used in the case when there is more than one
head.
3.2.4
LCL Constraints
The high level idea is the following. If the path encodes a good input, then nodes that are not
labeled Empty are required to output the input given to the ﬁrst node of the path (either a or b).
Otherwise, nodes can produce a locally checkable proof of an error (see Figure 2 for an example).
While nodes may output a or b even in the case in which the input is not a good input, nodes
must not be able to produce a proof error in the case in which the path encodes a good input. We
describe all these requirements as locally checkable constraints.
An output labeling for problem ΠMB is correct if the following conditions are satisﬁed for nodes
of the path P = (p0, . . . , pn−1). Note that, although nodes do not know their position on the path,
for the sake of simplicity we will denote with pi−1 the predecessor of pi, if it exists.
7

--- Page 9 ---
1. Each node v produces exactly one output label.
2. If Output(v) = Empty then Input(v) = Empty.
3. If v has no predecessors (i.e., v = p0) and Output(v) = Start(φ), then Input(v) = Start(φ).
4. If Output(pi−1) = a then Output(pi) ̸= b, and if Output(pi−1) = b then Output(pi) ̸= a.
5. If Output(pi) = Error0(j), then
• if j = 0 then the node has no predecessor;
• if j > 0 then Output(pi−1) = Error0(j −1).
6. If Output(pi) = Error1(j), then
• if j = 0, then Input(pi) = Separator;
• if j > 0 then Input(pi) ̸= Separator and Output(pi−1) = Error1(j −1).

9. If Output(pi) = Error4(current state, tape content, j), let (transition state, new content, ϵ) =
δ(current state, tape content)
• if j = 0, then Input(pi) = Tape(c, s, h) where c = tape content, s = current state, h = true;

where s ̸= transition state or h = false;
• otherwise, then Output(pi−1) = Error4(current state, tape content, j −1).

• Input(pi) = Start(φ) and pi has a predecessor;
• Input(pi−1) or Output(pi−1) is Empty;
• Output(pi−1) = Error;

The following property directly holds by deﬁnition of the constraints.
Property 1. Each node is able to locally check all constraints by just inspecting its own input and
output, and the ones of its predecessor (if it exists).
3.3
Upper Bound on the Complexity of the LCL
We need to consider two possible scenarios: either MB terminates within time T, or MB loops. In
the case in which MB loops, we show a simple O(n) algorithm that solves the LCL ΠMB. As we
know, any problem for which a solution exists can be solved in O(n) rounds in the LOCAL model by
gathering all the graph and solving the problem locally. There always exists a solution for problem
ΠMB if MB loops, in fact:
• If Input(p0) = Start(φ), then all nodes output φ, even if there are errors in the machine
encoding.
• Otherwise, if Input(p0) ̸= Start(φ), all nodes output Error.
It is easy to see that this output satisﬁes the LCL constraints described above.
Suppose that MB terminates. In this case, we show how to solve the LCL problem ΠMB in
constant time. More precisely, if MB terminates in T rounds, we show a distributed algorithm that
solves ΠMB in T ′ = 2+(B +1)T rounds. Each node v starts by gathering its T ′-radius neighborhood
Bv(T ′). Notice that, by deﬁnition, if the input is a good input, then for each node v that is taking
part in the encoding of the execution of MB (i.e., Input(v) ̸= Empty), Bv(T ′) contains p0. Hence, if
a node v does not see p0 after gathering its ball Bv(T ′), it means that the input is not a good input.
So, after gathering its T ′-radius ball, each node v does the following.
• If Input(v) = Empty, then Output(v) = Empty.
• If Bv(T ′) does not contain p0, or if Input(p0) ̸= Start(φ), then v outputs Error.
• If Bv(T ′) is a good input, then v outputs Start(φ).
The remaining case that we still need to handle is when Bv(T ′) contains p0, Input(p0) = Start(φ),
but Bv(T ′) does not look like a good input. We want nodes to produce a proof of an error in some
consistent way. Thus, we show that nodes can identify the ﬁrst error and produce a proof based on
that. First of all, notice that, since v sees the ﬁrst node in the path, v can compute its position i on
the path. Also, node v can identify who is the ﬁrst node u not satisfying the constraints of being a
good input. Let j be the position of u in the path, that is u = pj. Now we distinguish the following
cases based on Bu(B + 2) (the output of each node will be determined by the ﬁrst case encountered
in the following list).
9

--- Page 11 ---
1. If Input(pj) = Start(φ) and j ̸= 0, then, if i < j, Output(v) = Start(φ); otherwise Output(v) =
Error.
2. If j ≤B + 1, it means that either the initial state is encoded incorrectly, or the tape is not
initialized correctly, or the head is not initialized on the correct position. In this case, if i ≤j,
then Output(v) = Error0(i), otherwise Output(v) = Error.
3. If Input(pj−(B+1)) = Separator and Input(pj) ̸= Separator, then the length of the tape is too
long, and u expected to have in input Separator. Then, if i < j −(B +1), Output(v) = Start(φ);
if i > j then Output(v) = Error; otherwise, Output(v) = Error1(i −j + B + 1).
4. If Input(pj) = Separator and there exists a k such that 1 ≤j −k < B + 1 such that
Input(pk) = Separator, then the length of the tape is too short, and u did not expect to have a
separator. In this case, if i < k then Output(v) = Start(φ); if i ≥j then Output(v) = Error;
otherwise Output(v) = Error1(k −i).
5. If Input(pj−(B+1)) = Tape(c, s, h) where h = false, c = x, and Input(pj) = Tape(c′, s′, h′), where
c′ ̸= x, then the tape of MB has been copied incorrectly. In this case, if i < j −(B + 1), then
Output(v) = Start(φ); if i > j then Output(v) = Error; otherwise, Output(v) = Error2(x, i −j +
B + 1).
6. If Input(pj) = Tape(c, s, h) and Input(pj−1) = Separator and there exists a k < j + B such
that Input(pk) = Tape(c′, s′, h′) and that s ̸= s′, it means that nodes have inconsistent states.
Consider the minimum k satisfying the constraints. If i < k then Output(v) = Start(φ); if
i > k then Output(v) = Error; otherwise, Output(v) = Error3.
7. If none of the above is satisﬁed, it means that there exist a k satisfying j −k ≤B +2, such that
Input(pk) = Tape(c, s, h) and h = true. Let (transition state, new content, ϵ) = δ(s, c). It holds
that if ϵ is ←, −, or →, then j−k is respectively B, B+1, or B+2. If Input(pj) = Tape(c′, s′, h′),
where either h′ = false, or transition state ̸= s′, or s is a ﬁnal state, then there is some
error in the transition (this captures also the case where there is no head). If i < k, then
Output(v) = Start(φ); if i > j then Output(v) = Error; otherwise, Output(v) = Error4(s, c, k−i).
Notice that this case captures also the one where the head is missing.
8. If Input(pj) = Tape(c, s, h) where h = true, since all the above cases are not satisﬁed, it means
that there exists a k, such that Input(pk) = Tape(c′, s′, h′), h′ = true, |j −k| < B and all nodes
pmin(j,k), . . . , pmax(j,k) are labeled with some Tape. That is, there are at least two heads, one
on node pj and one on node pk. In this case, if i < min(j, k), then Output(v) = Start(φ); if
i > max(j, k) then Output(v) = Error; if i = min(j, k) then Output(v) = Error5(0), otherwise
Output(v) = Error5(1).
If the path encodes a good input, every node taking part in the encoding of the execution of MB
outputs Start(φ), and in this case it is easy to see that the output satisﬁes the LCL constraints.
Therefore, assume that the path does not correctly encode the execution of MB starting from
the correct tape content. First of all, notice that the algorithm handles all possible errors in the
machine encoding, that is, if the input is not good, at least one case of the list applies. Consider
all nodes v that do not have in input Empty, that is, all nodes taking part in the encoding of the
execution of MB. If node v sees the ﬁrst node p0, i.e., if the distance between p0 and v is at most
T ′ (notice that a good input has length T ′), then it is easy to see that the output satisﬁes the LCL
constraints. Some care is needed in the case where a node v outputs a generic error Error and v
does not see p0: we need to show that also in this case the output is valid, meaning that the LCL
10

--- Page 12 ---
constraints are satisﬁed. In this case, the distance between p0 and v is strictly greater than T ′, and
since the encoding of the execution of MB is not correct, then
• either the path (p0, . . . , v) does not correctly encode the execution of MB,
• or MB is not correctly initialized and it loops.
In the ﬁrst case, some node on the path between p0 and v will output some speciﬁc error Errorx where
x > 0, while in the second case initial nodes will output Error0. In both scenarios the constraints for
Error are satisﬁed. The complexity of the algorithm is O(B · T).
3.4
Lower Bound on the Complexity of the LCL
Let us deﬁne T ′′ as follows. If MB terminates in time T, then T ′′ = T ′ = 2 + (B + 1)T. If MB loops,
then T ′′ = n. We prove a lower bound on the complexity of ΠMB of Ω(T ′′) rounds, by showing that
Ω(T ′′) rounds are needed in the case where the input is a good input. In particular, we show that,
in a good input, for all nodes v such that Input(v) ̸= Empty, Output(v) must be Start(φ). The result
then comes from the fact that, for some nodes, it requires Ω(T ′′) rounds in order to see if φ = a or
φ = b.
First of all, we ignore nodes that have in input Empty since, in a good input, they are at distance
at least T ′′ + 1 from p0, the ﬁrst node of the path. Hence, assume that a node v not having Empty in
input does not output Start(φ). In this case, v can either output a generic error Error, or a speciﬁc
error Errorx. If all nodes output Error, the veriﬁer rejects on p0. If all nodes, starting from a node
pi where i > 0, output Error, and all nodes pi′ with i′ < i output Start(φ), then the veriﬁer rejects
on pi. Therefore, let us assume that there is at least a node that outputs a speciﬁc error Errorx. We
write succ(v) and dist(u, v) to denote respectively the successor of a node v in the path, and the
distance between two nodes u and v in the path.
• If x = 0, the veriﬁer accepts only if this error produces a chain that starts from p0 and
proceeds with increasing values. In order to be accepted, this chain must end at a node w′,
and succ(w′) must output Error. Then, succ(w′) must witness that w′ indeed has a local error
in the machine initialization, which is not possible in a good input.
• If x = 1, we could have two cases:
– there is a chain of increasing values that starts from a node w with Input(w) = Separator,
and ends on a node w′ such that dist(w, w′) < B, Input(succ(w′)) = Separator, and
Output(succ(w′)) = Error (the tape is too short);
– there is a chain of increasing values that starts from a node w with Input(w) = Separator,
and ends on a node w′ such that dist(w, w′) = B, Input(succ(w′)) ̸= Separator, and
Output(succ(w′)) = Error (the tape is too long).
Since, in a good input, the distance between two nodes having in input Separator is always
B + 1, the above scenarios are not possible.
• If x = 2, there must be a chain of length exactly B + 1, starting from a node w having
Input(w) = Tape(c, s, h), where c = x ∈{0, 1}, h = false, and ending on a node w′ such that
dist(w, w′) = B + 1, and Input(w′) = Tape(c′, s′, h′), where c′ ̸= x. In a good input, the tape
content of nodes w and w′ must be the same.
• If x = 3, it means that there must exist two neighbors having two diﬀerent states, and this
can not happen in a good input.
11

--- Page 13 ---
• If x = 4, there must be a chain that propagates the old state and old input, and the veriﬁer
accepts only if acknowledges that the transition has been wrongly encoded, which can not the
case in a good input.
• If x = 5, there must be a chain of length at least 2 not passing through nodes having in input
Separator, starting from a node w with Input(w) = Tape(c, s, h) where h = true, and ending
on a node w′ with Input(w′) = Tape(c′, s′, h′) where h′ = true. This is not possible on a good
input.
Therefore, since nodes can not output any kind of error, and since Empty is not a valid output for
the nodes encoding the LBA, then these nodes must output Start(φ), where the value of φ matches
the input of the ﬁrst node of the path. Hence, ΠMB requires Ω(T ′′).
3.5
Normalizing an LCL Problem
We now show how to β-normalize an LCL ΠMB and obtain a new LCL having roughly the same time
complexity. We deﬁne three diﬀerent veriﬁers depending on their view.
• A Vin,in −out,out veriﬁer running at node v, checks Input(v), Input(pred(v)), Output(v), and
Output((pred(v)).
• A Vin −out veriﬁer running at node v, checks Input(v) and Output(v).
• A Vout −out veriﬁer running at node v checks Output(v) and Output((pred(v)).
Lemma 2. Consider an LCL P with |ΣP
in| = α and |ΣP
out| = β that can be solved in time T and can
be locally checked with a Vin,in −out,out veriﬁer. It is possible to deﬁne an LCL P′ such that |ΣP′
in | = α
and |ΣP′
out| = α · β that can be solved in time T and can be locally checked with a Vin −out and a
Vout −out veriﬁer.
Proof. We deﬁne ΣP′
in = ΣP
in, and ΣP′
out = ΣP
out × ΣP
out. Let Output(v) = (in, out) ∈ΣP′
out. Let
Output(pred(v)) = (in′, out′) ∈ΣP′
out. The Vin −out veriﬁer checks that Input(v) = in. The Vout −out
veriﬁer acts the same as the Vin,in −out,out veriﬁer executed on ((in′, out′), (in, out)). The LCL problem
P′ can be solved with the following algorithm at each node v.
• Gather the ball Bv(T).
• Simulate the original algorithm on Bv(T); let out be the output of this simulation.
• Output (Input(v), out).
It is easy to check that this output is valid for the problem P′, and that it requires T rounds. Also,
note that it is not possible to solve P′ faster than T. In fact, in order to satisfy the Vin −out veriﬁer,
the input must be copied correctly; while in order to satisfy the Vout −out veriﬁer, we need to satisfy
the Vin,in −out,out veriﬁer executed giving the same input that it would have seen on P.
Lemma 3. Consider an LCL P with |ΣP
in| = α and |ΣP
out| = β that can be solved in time T and can
be locally checked with a Vin −out and a Vout −out veriﬁer. We can deﬁne a β′-normalized LCL P′
with β′ = |ΣP′
out| = 2γ · (|ΣP
out| + 3) that can be solved in time Θ(γ · T(n/γ)), where γ = 2⌈log α⌉+ 3.
Proof. In the following we will exploit the ability of an algorithm to work on identiﬁers that can
be polynomial in the size of the graph. In particular, we assume that if an algorithm works on an
instance with IDs in the range 1, . . . , r, then it works also on an instance with IDs in the range
1, . . . , γ · r. Then, we show how to deﬁne an LCL P′ such that:
• if the input instance encodes a virtual instance for the problem P, it is required to solve P on
the virtual instance;
12

--- Page 14 ---
• otherwise, it is required to prove that the encoding is wrong.
Let V′
in −out and V′
out −out be the veriﬁers of our β′-normalized LCL.
Encoding P in P′.
We start by deﬁning how to encode an instance of P of size n, as an
instance of P′ of size N = γ · n. We denote with p0, . . . , pn−1 and p′
0, . . . , p′
γ·n−1 respectively the
instance of P and the one of P′. Let a = ⌈log α⌉. For the sake of simplicity, let us rename nodes
p′
γi, . . . , p′
γ(i+1)−1, where 0 ≤i ≤n −1, as qi
0, . . . , qi
2a+2 (notice that 2a + 2 = γ −1). The ﬁrst a + 1
nodes, qi
0, . . . , qi
a, have input 1, while nodes qi
a+1 and qi
2a+2 have input 0. Each of the remaining a
nodes, qi
a+2, . . . , qi
2a+1, has in input one bit of the binary representation of Input(pi), in some ﬁxed
order (see Figure 3 for an illustration).
The V′
in −out Veriﬁer.
The set of output labels of P′ is ΣP′
out = 2γ × (Σout ∪{Er, E, El}). Let qi
j
be a node of the instance of P′ where 0 ≤i ≤n −1 and 0 ≤j ≤2a + 2. Let Input(qi
j) ∈{0, 1}, and
let Output(qi
j) = ((b0, . . . , b2a+2), out) ∈ΣP′
out. The V′
in −out veriﬁer running at qi
j checks that
• Input(qi
j) = b0, and
• if out ∈ΣP
out, then
– if all bits in b0, . . . , ba are 1s, checks that the original Vin −out veriﬁer accepts on
(x, out), where x is obtained by recovering the input pi for the original algorithm from
ba+2, . . . , b2a+1.
The V′
out −out Veriﬁer.
Let the output of pi
j be ((b0, . . . , b2a+2), out) ∈ΣP′
out and the output of
the predecessor of pi
j be ((b′
0, . . . , b′
2a+2), out′) ∈ΣP′
out The O-O veriﬁer ﬁrst checks that
• b0 = b′
1, b1 = b′
2, . . . , b2a+1 = b′
2a+2, and
• if out ∈ΣP
out and out′ ∈ΣP
out, then
– if at least one bit in b0, . . . , ba is 0 , then out = out′,
– if all bits in b0, . . . , ba are 1s, then check that the original Vout −out executed on (out′, out)
accepts.
Dealing with Errors.
We now add some constraints to handle the case in which out /∈
ΣP
out. Let the output of pi
j be ((b0, . . . , b2a+2), out) and the output of the predecessor of pi
j be
((b′
0, . . . , b′
2a+2), out′). The V′
in −out veriﬁer additionally checks that, if out = E, then the encoding is
not locally valid, that is,
• either
– there are two numbers x, y ≥0, x + y ≤a, such that b0, . . . , bx−1 and b2a+3−y, . . . , b2a+2
are all equal to 1, bx = 0, b2a+2−y = 0, and
– there is not a contiguous sequence of length a + 1 of all 1s in b0, . . . , b2a+2,
• or b0, . . . , ba are all 1s but either ba+1 ̸= 0 or b2a+2 ̸= 0.
The V′
out −out veriﬁer running on pi
j additionally checks that,
• if out = El, then pi
j must have a predecessor, and it must hold that out′ /∈{Er} ∪ΣP
out;
• if out ∈ΣP
out, if pi
j has a predecessor, then out′ must be diﬀerent from Er;
• if out = Er, then pi
j must have a successor.
13

--- Page 15 ---
Let N be the size of the graph. An algorithm solving P′ in (γ + 1) · T rounds does the following at
each node v′:
• Gather the ball Bv′((γ + 1) · T).
• If Bv′((γ + 1) · T) looks like a correct encoding of an input instance of P
– let u′ be the nearest left node having input 1 and other a successors, succ(1)u′, . . . , succ(a)u′,
having also input 1
– Compute the virtual instance for P (setting the IDs to be the same of the nodes satisfying
the above)
– Simulate the original algorithm on the virtual instance by setting n = N/γ, let out be
the output of u′
– Output ((Input(v′), Input(succ(1)v′), . . . , Input(succ(γ−1)v′), out)
• Otherwise,
– if there is a local error, output E
– if the nearest error is on the left, output El
– otherwise, output Er
It is easy to check that the output of the algorithm satisﬁes the constraints. In order to show a
lower bound for the new LCL, we now show that it is not possible to produce errors in a graph
that is a valid encoding. In fact, nodes can not cheat by wrongly outputting the input of the
neighbors, otherwise either the input-output veriﬁer notices inconsistencies on the ﬁrst bit, or the
output-output veriﬁer notices inconsistencies on the other bits. Then, on a valid encoding, no input
satisﬁes the constraints that allows to produce E as output. Finally, the constraints impose that a
chain of Er or El points to a node that is outputting E.
Note that, if the original LCL has complexity T, then the new LCL, on instances of size N = γ ·n,
has complexity Θ(γ(T(n))) = Θ(γ · T(N
γ )).
3.6
Hardness Results
Theorem 4. There are β-normalized LCLs that can be solved in constant time but the distributed
time complexity is 2Ω(β).
Proof. The complexity of ΠMB is Θ(B · T) if MB terminates in T steps.
|Σin| = O(1) and
|Σout| = Θ(B). We can convert it to an LCL where |Σin| = 2, |Σout| = Θ(B), and the complexity is
still Θ(B · T). There exist LBAs that terminate in 2Θ(B) steps (e.g. a binary counter). Thus, the
complexity of the obtained LCL is Θ(B · 2Θ(B)), that is 2Ω(B) = 2Ω(|Σout|) = 2Ω(β).
Theorem 5. It is PSPACE-hard to distinguish whether a given LCL problem P with input labels
can be solved in O(1) time or needs Ω(n) time on globally oriented path graphs.
Proof. It is PSPACE-hard to distinguish whether a given LBA terminates or loops (see e.g. [10]).
Note that the description of a β-normalized LCL has size O(β2). In order to decide if a β-normalized
version of a problem in Π requires O(1) or Ω(n) we need to decide if its associated LBA, running on
a tape of size B = Θ(β), terminates or loops, and this implies the theorem.
14

--- Page 16 ---
3.7
Extending the Results to Undirected Cycles
We show how to extend the above results, which apply to globally oriented paths, to the case where
the input graph is an undirected path or an undirected cycle. We ﬁrst focus on showing how to
adapt these results to undirected paths. Given a β-normalized LCL P deﬁned on directed paths,
we can deﬁne an LCL P′ in which the set of input labels is Σ′
in = {0, 1} × {0, 1, 2}, and the set of
output labels is Σ′
out = {0, 1, 2} × {1, . . . , β, E}. Let Vin −out and Vout −out be the veriﬁers of the
β-normalized LCL P, and let V′
in −out and V′
out −out be the veriﬁers of the LCL P′. The idea is that
we can use 3 symbols to give an orientation as input to the nodes, by giving 0 to the ﬁrst node, 1 to
the second, 2 to the third, 0 to the fourth, and so on. Nodes must copy their orientation number to
the output, and then, if the given orientation is consistent, nodes are required to solve the original
problem P. On the other hand, if the orientation is not consistent, nodes are allowed to output an
error E. Also, in order to avoid the need of error pointers, we allow nodes to treat the places where
the orientation is not consistent, as a place where the path ends.
This new LCL can be checked as follows. The V′
in −out veriﬁer takes in input the input and
the output of the current node (as before) and ﬁrst checks that the orientation has been copied
correctly, and then checks that the original Vin −out veriﬁer accepts. To verify the output, we allow
the V′
out −out veriﬁer to see slightly more than the original veriﬁer Vout −out. The V′
out −out veriﬁer
sees a triple containing the output of the node and the outputs of its neighbors. Note that the
veriﬁer does not know the orientation of the path (and the orientation of the triple), but it can
recover it from the output of the nodes (that contains a copy of the orientation given as input).
Then the V′
out −out veriﬁer checks that, if the node outputted E, the orientation is indeed wrong. If
the output is a value in 1, . . . , β, the veriﬁer V′
out −out runs the original Vout −out veriﬁer, since it
can compute which neighbor is the predecessor. It is easy to see that the complexity of P′ is the
same as the one of P.
The LCL description of P′, that is, the size of its input, its output, and its veriﬁer, is now O(β3),
therefore the hardness result still applies.
We now show how an LCL for paths can be converted to an LCL for cycles. The idea is the
following. On a cycle, we give an additional input to each node in {0, 1}. Nodes marked as 1 are
exempt to solve the problem and act as separators between the other nodes. That is, nodes are
required to solve the original problem on the subpaths that lie between nodes marked as 1. It may
be the case that no node has 1 as input. In this case we allow nodes to output a special error. If a
node decides to output this error, both its neighbors must output the same, that is, all nodes must
output the same. We impose the constraint that a node marked as 1 can not output this error. A
worst case instance would be the one in which one node is marked 1 and all other nodes are marked
0—this would represent a path with a length that is roughly equal to the one of the cycle. There
is one case that requires a bit of care: if all nodes are marked 0, but the original problem can be
solved in sublinear time, nodes could not be able to coordinate to produce the special error. For our
purpose, it is possible to check that, if we consider the problem ΠMB previously deﬁned in the case
in which MB terminates, in an instance in which nobody has a predecessor, nodes can eﬃciently
solve the problem by just outputting Error or Empty, depending on their input.

Encoding Input Labels as Trees
In this section we demonstrate a reduction from the LCL problem P with input labels on any graph
G to an LCL problem P⋆without input labels on the modiﬁed graph G⋆. The modiﬁed graph G⋆
is the result of attaching a rooted tree to each v ∈V (G) that encodes the input label of v for the
LCL problem P. The reduction allows us to extend the hardness proof to the case of LCL problems
15

without input labels.
Encoding.
Given a 2k-bit binary string S = (s1, . . . , s2k), deﬁne Enc(S) as the rooted tree
constructed as follows.
• Begin with the full binary tree which has 2k leaves, and the distance from the root to each
leaf is k.
• For each non-leaf node v, let u be any one of its two children, and subdivide the edge {v, u}
into two edges {v, w} and {w, u}, where w is a new node. The node w is designated as the
left child of v.
• Let U = (u1 . . . , u2k) be the leaves ordered by the in-order traversal.
• For each i ∈[2k], add two new nodes x and y as the children of ui. If si = 1, add two more
new nodes x′ and y′ and the two edges {x, x′} and {y, y′}.
The tree Enc(S) has maximum degree 3, and all nodes are within distance 2(k + 1) to the root.
Given a graph G such that each node v ∈V (G) is associated with an input label L(v) ∈Σin, deﬁne
G⋆as the graph resulting from the following operations on G. For each node v ∈V (G), attach the
rooted tree T = Enc(L(v)) to v by adding the edge {v, z}, where z is the root of T. Notice that
∆(G⋆) = max{3, ∆(G) + 1}.
Decoding.
Given a rooted tree T = Enc(S) for some S ∈{0, 1}2k, deﬁne Dec(T) = S. The
decoding can be done by the following procedure. Consider an in-order traversal of the tree such
that (i) for each node v such that exactly one of its children w has degree 2, treat w as the left child
of v, (ii) print ‘1’ if a node that has two children of degree 2 is encountered, (iii) print ‘0’ if a node
that has two children of degree 1 is encountered. Then the printed sequence is S.
The Modiﬁed LCL Problem P⋆.
Let P be an LCL problem with input labels. Suppose that
the radius of P is r, and the maximum degree is ∆. Set k = ⌈log log |Σin|⌉, and let each label in Σin
be represented by a distinct 2k-bit string. The modiﬁed LCL problem P⋆, which does not require
input label, is deﬁned by the following rules. The set of the output labels of P⋆is Σout, the same as
that of P. Let G⋆be a graph with maximum degree ≤∆+ 1.
• Deﬁne G1 = G⋆.
For each 2 ≤i ≤k + 2, deﬁne Gi as the graph induced by nodes in V (G⋆) −Si−1
j=1(Aj ∪Bj).
For each i ∈[k + 2], deﬁne Ai = {v ∈V (Gi)| degGi(v) = 1}.
For each i ∈[k + 1], deﬁne Bi = {v ∈V (Gi)| degGi(v) = 2 and ∃u ∈Ai s.t. {u, v} ∈E(Gi)}.
• Deﬁne Vlabel = Sk+2
j=1 Aj ∪Sk+1
j=1 Bj.
Deﬁne Vmain as the set of nodes in V (G⋆) \ Vlabel that have exactly one neighbor in Vlabel.
• For each v ∈Vmain, deﬁne L(v) as follows. Let u be the unique node in Vlabel adjacent to
v, and let T be the connected component induced by nodes in Vlabel that contains u. Set
L(v) = Dec(T) (with u being the root of T). If the decoding procedure Dec(T) fails, simply
set L(v) as the ﬁrst label in Σin.
• The output labeling, together with the input labeling deﬁned by the function L(·), forms a
legal labeling of the subgraph induced by the nodes in Vmain for P.
16

--- Page 18 ---
Notice that the connected components in Vlabel are the trees encoding input labels, and the subgraph
induced by the nodes in Vmain is G (as long as G does not contain isolated node). The function L(v)
recovers the input label of v for each v ∈V (G). Given that P has a valid labeling on all graphs
(resp., trees) of maximum degree ∆, the modiﬁed LCL problem P⋆also has a valid labeling on all
graphs (resp., trees) of maximum degree ∆+ 1.
Reducing the Radius.
The above deﬁnition of P⋆requires radius r + O(k), as a node v ∈Vmain
needs O(k) extra rounds to calculate L(u) for all u ∈Nr(v)∪Vmain. We present a simple modiﬁcation
that reduces the radius to only r + O(1) at the cost of expanding the number of output labels from
|Σout| to |Σout| + 22k < |Σout| + |Σin|2. The idea is to let nodes in Vlabel to use output labels to
pass the information stored at the leaves to the root based on local rules. Consider a connected
component T induced by nodes in Vlabel. The subgraph T is interpreted as a tree rooted at the
unique node in T that is adjacent to some node in Vmain.
Base Case: Let v ∈A2. If v is adjacent to two nodes in B1, the output label of v is 1; otherwise
the output label of v is 0.
Root / Degree-3 Nodes: Let 3 ≤i ≤k + 2, and let v ∈Ai. Then v has a unique neighbor
uleft ∈Bi+1 and a unique neighbor uright ∈Ai+1. Let Sleft be the output label of uleft, and let
Sright be the output label of uright. Then the output label of v is the binary string Sleft ◦Sright.
Degree-2 Nodes: Let 3 ≤i ≤k + 1, and let v ∈Bi. Then v has a unique neighbor u ∈Ai+1. The
output label of v is the same as the output label of u.
Thus, for each node v ∈Vmain, L(v) is simply the output label of the unique node u ∈Vlabel ∩N(v).
Theorem 6. For any LCL problem P on any graph G of maximum degree ∆that does not have
isolated nodes, the following two statements are equivalent.
• The labeling L: V (G) →Σout is a valid labeling of G for the problem P.
• There exists some labeling L′ of the nodes in Vlabel such that L and L′ together form a valid
labeling of G⋆for the problem P⋆.
Theorem 7. It is PSPACE-hard to distinguish whether a given LCL problem P without input labels
can be solved in O(1) time or needs Ω(n) time on trees with degree ∆= 3.

Decidability
In this section, we show that the two gaps ω(1)—o(log∗n) and ω(log∗n)—o(n) for LCL problems
with input labels on paths and cycles are decidable. More speciﬁcally, given a speciﬁcation of an
LCL problem P, there is an algorithm that outputs a description of an asymptotically optimal
deterministic LOCAL algorithm for P, as well as its time complexity.
We will prove the statements for the case of cycles, but the analogous results for cycles and paths
follows as a simple corollary, as we can encode constraints related to degree-1 nodes as constraints
related to nodes adjacent to a special input label. Furthermore, having a promise that the input is
a path does not change the time complexity of an LCL problem: if a problem can be solved in time
T = o(n) in labeled paths, the same algorithm will solve it also in time T = o(n) in labeled cycles.
The proof of Theorem 8 is in Section 4.2; the proof of Theorem 9 is in Section 4.5.
17

--- Page 19 ---
Theorem 8. For any LCL problem P on cycle graphs, its deterministic LOCAL complexity is either
Ω(n) or O(log∗n). Moreover, there is an algorithm that decides whether P has complexity Ω(n)
or O(log∗n) on cycle graphs; for the case the complexity is O(log∗n), the algorithm outputs a
description of an O(log∗n)-round deterministic LOCAL algorithm that solves P.
Theorem 9. For any LCL problem P on cycle graphs, its deterministic LOCAL complexity is either
Ω(log∗n) or O(1). Moreover, there is an algorithm that decides whether P has complexity Ω(log∗n)
or O(1) on cycle graphs; for the case the complexity is O(1), the algorithm outputs a description of
an O(1)-round deterministic LOCAL algorithm that solves P.
Graph Notation.
For convenience, in this section, a directed path P with input labels is
alternatively described as a string in Σk
in, where k > 0 is the number of nodes in P. Similarly,
an output labeling L of P is alternatively described as a string in Σk
out. In subsequent discussion,
we freely switch between the graph-theoretic notation and the string notation. Given an output
labeling L of P, we say that L is locally consistent at v if the input and output labeling assigned to
Nr(v) is acceptable for v. Note that Nr(v) refers to the radius-r neighborhood of v. Given two
integers a ≤b, the notation [a, b] represents the set of all integers {a, a + 1, . . . , b}. Given a string
w, denote wR as the reverse of w.
Overview.
Before we proceed, we brieﬂy discuss the high level idea of the proofs. The main tool
underlying the proofs is the “pumping lemma” which was developed in [6]. Intuitively, we classify
the set of all input-labeled paths into a ﬁnite number of equivalence classes satisfying the following
property. Let P be a subpath of G, and let P ′ be another path that is of the same equivalence
class as P. Given a complete legal labeling of G, if we let G′ be the result of replacing P with
P ′, then it is always possible to extend this partial labeling of G′ to a complete legal labeling by
appropriately labeling P ′. The pumping lemma guarantees that for any path P whose length is
at least the pumping constant ℓpump, and for any number x ≥ℓpump, there is another path P ′ of
length at least x and P ′ is of the same equivalence class as P.
Informally, in the proof of Theorem 8, we show that any LCL problem P solvable in o(n) rounds
can be solved in O(log∗n) rounds in the following canonical way based on a “feasible labeling
function” f. Intuitively, a labeling function f is feasible if for any given independent set I that is
suﬃciently well-spaced, we can apply f to assign the output labels to each v ∈I and its nearby
neighbors locally such that this partial labeling can always be extended to a complete legal labeling.
The ω(log∗n)—o(n) gap and the decidability result follows from these two claims.
• If there is an o(n)-round algorithm A that solves P, then a feasible function f exists. This
is proved by ﬁrst create an imaginary graph where some paths are extended using pumping
lemmas, and then apply a simulation of A on the imaginary graph.
• Whether a feasible function exists is decidable. Intuitively, this is due to the fact that the
number of equivalence classes is ﬁnite.
The proof of Theorem 9 is a little more complicated since the time budget is only O(1), so
we cannot even aﬀord to ﬁnd an MIS. To solve this issue, we decompose the cycle graph G into
paths with unrepetitive patterns and paths with repetitive patterns, in O(1) rounds. For paths
with unrepetitive patterns, we are able to compute a suﬃciently well-spaced MIS in O(1) rounds
by making use of the irregularity of the input patterns. Paths with repetitive patterns are similar
to the paths without input labels, and we will show that we can always label them by repetitive
output patterns, given that the underlying LCL problem is o(log∗n)-time solvable.

4.1
Pumping Lemmas for Paths
Let P = (s, . . . , t) be a directed path, where each node has an input label from Σin. The tripartition
of the nodes ξ(P) = (D1, D2, D3) is deﬁned as follows:
D1 = Nr−1(s) ∪Nr−1(t),
D2 =
 N2r−1(s) ∪N2r−1(t)

\ D1,
D3 = P \ (D1 ∪D2).
See Figure 4 for an illustration. More speciﬁcally, suppose P = (u1, . . . , uk), and let i ∈[1, k]. Then
we have:
• ui ∈D1 if and only if i ∈[1, r] ∪[k −r + 1, k].
• ui ∈D2 if and only if i ∈[r + 1, 2r] ∪[k −2r + 1, k −r].
• ui ∈D3 if and only if i /∈[1, 2r] ∪[k −2r + 1, k].
Let L: D1 ∪D2 →Σout assign output labels to D1 ∪D2. We say that L is extendible w.r.t. P if
there exists a complete labeling L⋄of P such that L⋄agrees with L on D1 ∪D2, and L⋄is locally
consistent at all nodes in D2 ∪D3.
An Equivalence Class.
We deﬁne an equivalence class ⋆∼for the directed paths (i.e., the set of
all non-empty strings in Σ∗
in), as follows.
Consider two directed paths P = (u1, . . . , ux) and P ′ = (v1, . . . , vy), and let ξ(P) = (D1, D2, D3)
and ξ(P ′) = (D′
1, D′
2, D′
3). Consider the following natural 1-to-1 correspondence φ: (D1 ∪D2) →
(D′
1 ∪D′
2) deﬁned as φ(ui) = vi and φ(ux−i+1) = vy−i+1 for each i ∈[1, 2r].
The 1-to-1
correspondence is well-deﬁned so long as (i) x = y or (ii) x ≥4r and y ≥4r. We have P
⋆∼P ′ if
and only if the following two statements are met:
• Isomorphism: The 1-to-1 correspondence φ is well-deﬁned, and for each ui ∈D1 ∪D2,
the input label of ui is identical to the input label of φ(ui).
• Extendibility: Let L be any assignment of output labels to nodes in D1 ∪D2, and let
L′ be the corresponding output labeling of D′
1 ∪D′
2 under φ. Then L is extendible w.r.t.
P if and only if L′ is extendible w.r.t. P ′.
Note that for the special case of x ≤4r, we have P
⋆∼P ′ if and only if P is identical to P ′.
Deﬁne Type(P) as the equivalence class of P w.r.t. ⋆∼. The following technical lemma is analogous
to [6, Lemma 1] in a specialized setting. We only use this lemma to prove the lemmas in Section 4.1.
19

Lemma 10. Let G be a path graph or a cycle graph where all nodes have input labels from Σin. Let
P be a directed subpath of G, and let P ′ be another directed path such that Type(P ′) = Type(P).
We write ξ(P) = (D1, D2, D3) and ξ(P ′) = (D′
1, D′
2, D′
3). Let L⋄be any complete labeling of G
such that L⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in D2 ∪D3. Let G′ = Replace(G, P, P ′) be the graph
resulting from replacing P with P ′ in G. Then there exists a complete labeling L′
⋄of G′ such that
the following two conditions are met.
1. For each v ∈(V (G) \ V (P))∪(D1∪D2) and its corresponding v′ ∈(V (G′) \ V (P ′))∪(D′
1∪D′
2),
we have L⋄(v) = L′
⋄(v′). Moreover, if v ∈(V (G) \ V (P)) ∪D1 and L⋄is locally consistent at
v, then L′
⋄is locally consistent at v′.
2. L′
⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in D′
2 ∪D′
3.
Proof. The labeling L′
⋄(v′) of G′ for each v′ ∈(V (G′) \ V (P ′)) ∪(D′
1 ∪D′
2) is chosen “naturally”
as follows.
For each v′ ∈V (G′) \ V (P ′), we set L′
⋄(v′) = L⋄(v) for its corresponding node
v ∈V (G)\V (P). For each v′ ∈D′
1∪D′
2, we set L′
⋄(v′) = L⋄(v) for its corresponding node v ∈D1∪D2
such that φ(v) = v′ in the deﬁnition of ⋆∼. At this point, it is clear that if v ∈(V (G) \ V (P)) ∪D1
has a locally consistent labeling under L⋄, then its corresponding node v′ ∈(V (G′) \ V (P ′)) ∪D′
1
also has a locally consistent labeling under L′
⋄, so Condition 1 holds.
Now, the labeling L′
⋄is only undeﬁned for nodes in D′
3. We show that we can complete the
labeling in such a way that is locally consistent at all nodes in D′
2 ∪D′
3. Denote L as L⋄restricted
to D1 ∪D2. Since L⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in P, the labeling L is extendible w.r.t. P.
Note that if we let L′ be L⋄restricted to D′
1 ∪D′
2, then according to the way we deﬁne L′
⋄, the two
labeling L′ and L are identical under the 1-to-1 correspondence φ speciﬁed in the deﬁnition of ⋆∼.
That is, for each v′ ∈D′
1 ∪D′
2, we have L′(v′) = L(v) for its corresponding node v ∈D1 ∪D2 such
that φ(v) = v′. Since P
⋆∼P ′, the labeling L′ must be extendible w.r.t. P ′. That is, there is a way
to assign L′
⋄(v′) for each v′ ∈D′
3 such that all nodes in D′
2 ∪D′
3 have locally consistent labelings
under L′
⋄, so Condition 2 holds.
One useful consequence of this lemma is that if we start with a path or a cycle G with a legal
labeling, after replacing its subpath P with another one P ′ having the same type as P, then it
is always possible to assign output labeling to P ′ to get a legal labeling without changing the
already-assigned output labels of nodes outside of P ′.
Lemma 11. Let G be a path graph or a cycle graph where all nodes have input labels from Σin. Let
P be a directed subpath of G, and let P ′ be another directed path such that Type(P ′) = Type(P). Let
L⋄be complete labeling of G that is locally consistent at all nodes in P. Let G′ = Replace(G, P, P ′)
be the graph resulting from replacing P with P ′ in G. Then there exists a legal labeling L′
⋄of G′
such that the following two conditions are met.
1. For each v ∈V (G) \ V (P) and its corresponding v′ ∈V (G′) \ V (P ′), we have L⋄(v) = L′
⋄(v′).
Moreover, if L⋄is locally consistent at v ∈V (G) \ V (P), then L′
⋄is locally consistent at v′.
2. L′
⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in P ′.
Proof. We write ξ(P ′) = (D′
1, D′
2, D′
3). Condition 1 in this lemma is implied by Condition 1 in
Lemma 10. To see that Condition 2 in this lemma holds, note that in this lemma we additionally
require that L⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in P. Therefore, Condition 1 of Lemma 10 implies
that L′
⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in D′
1. This observation, together with Condition 2 of
Lemma 10, implies that L′
⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in P ′.
20

The following lemma is analogous to [6, Theorem 4] in a specialized setting. We only use this
lemma in Section 4.1.
Lemma 12. Let P = (v1, . . . , vk), and let P ′ = (v1, . . . , vk−1). Let the input label of vk be α. Then
Type(P) is a function of α and Type(P ′).
Proof. We prove the following stronger statement. Let G be a directed path, and let H be a
directed subpath of G.
Suppose H′ is another directed path satisfying Type(H) = Type(H′).
Let G′ = Replace(G, H, H′) be the result of replacing H with H′ in G.
Then we claim that
Type(G) = Type(G′). The lemma is a corollary of this claim.
Consider the tripartitions ξ(H) = (B1, B2, B3), ξ(H′) = (B′
1, B′
2, B′
3), ξ(G) = (D1, D2, D3), and
ξ(G′) = (D′
1, D′
2, D′
3). We write B0 = V (G) \ V (H) and B′
0 = V (G′) \ V (H′).
Let φ⋆be the natural 1-to-1 correspondence from B0 ∪B1 ∪B2 to B′
0 ∪B′
1 ∪B′
2. Note that
D1 ∪D2 ⊆B0 ∪B1 ∪B2 and D′
1 ∪D′
2 ⊆B′
0 ∪B′
1 ∪B′
2. Also, the 1-to-1 correspondence between
D1 ∪D2 and D′
1 ∪D′
2 given by φ⋆is exactly the 1-to-1 correspondence φ speciﬁed in the requirement
of G ⋆∼G′.
Let L: (D1 ∪D2) →Σout and let L′ be the corresponding output labeling of D′
1 ∪D′
2, under
the 1-to-1 correspondence φ. To show that G ⋆∼G′, all we need to do is show that L is extendible
w.r.t. G if and only if L′ is extendible w.r.t. G′. Since we can also write G = Replace(G′, H′, H), it
suﬃces to show just one direction, i.e., if L is extendible then L′ is extendible.
Suppose L is extendible. Then there exists an output labeling L⋄of G such that (i) for each
v ∈D1 ∪D2, we have L⋄(v) = L(v), and (ii) L⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in D2 ∪D3. Since
D2 ∪D3 ⊇B2 ∪B3, we can apply Lemma 10, which shows that there exists a complete labeling
L′
⋄of G′ such that the two conditions in Lemma 10 are met. We argue that this implies that L′ is
extendible. We verify that (i) L′(v′) = L′
⋄(v′) for each v′ ∈D′
1 ∪D′
2, and (ii) L′
⋄is locally consistent
at all nodes in D′
2 ∪D′
3.
• Condition 1 of Lemma 10 guarantees that L⋄(v) = L′
⋄(φ⋆(v)) for each v ∈(V (G) \ V (H)) ∪
(B1 ∪B2) = B0 ∪B1 ∪B2 and its corresponding node φ⋆(v) ∈B′
0 ∪B′
1 ∪B′
2. Since D′
1 ∪D′
2 ⊆
B′
0 ∪B′
1 ∪B′
2, we have L′(v′) = L′
⋄(v′) for each v′ ∈D′
1 ∪D′
2.
• The fact that L⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in D2 ∪D3, together with Condition 1 in
Lemma 10, guarantees that L′
⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in (D′
2 ∪D′
3) \ B′
3. Condition 2
in Lemma 10 guarantees that L′
⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in B′
2 ∪B′
3. Therefore, L′
⋄is
locally consistent at all nodes in D′
2 ∪D′
3, as required.
The number of types can be upper bounded as follows.
Lemma 13. The number of equivalence classes of ⋆∼(i.e., types) is at most |Σin|4r2|Σout|4r.
Proof. Let P be a directed path, and let ξ(P) = (D1, D2, D3). Then Type(P) is determined by the
following information.
• The input labels in D1 ∪D2. Note that there are at most |Σin|4r possible input labeling of
D1 ∪D2.
• A length-x binary string indicating the extendibility of each possible output labeling of D1∪D2,
where x = |Σout|4r.
Therefore, the number of equivalence classes of ⋆∼is at most |Σin|4r2|Σout|4r.
21

Deﬁne ℓpump as the total number of types. Observe that Lemma 12 implies that Type(P) can be
computed by a ﬁnite automaton whose number of states is the total number of types, which is a
constant independent of P. Thus, we have the following two pumping lemmas which allow us to
extend the length of a given directed path P while preserving the type of P. The following two
lemmas follow from the standard pumping lemma for regular language.
Lemma 14. Let P ∈Σk
in with k ≥ℓpump.
Then P can be decomposed into three substrings
P = x ◦y ◦z such that (i) |xy| ≤ℓpump, (ii) |y| ≥1, and (iii) for each non-negative integer i,
Type(x ◦yi ◦z) = Type(P).
Lemma 15. For each w ∈Σ>0
in , there exist two positive integers a and b such that a + b ≤ℓpump,
and Type(wai+b) is invariant for each non-negative integer i.
4.2
The ω(log∗n)—o(n) Gap
In this section we show that the ω(log∗n)—o(n) gap is decidable. More speciﬁcally, we show that
an LCL problem P can be solved in O(log∗n) rounds if and only if there exists a feasible function,
which is deﬁned as follows.
Input: A directed path P = w1 ◦S ◦w2, where |w1| ∈[ℓpump, ℓpump + 1], |w2| ∈[ℓpump, ℓpump + 1],
and |S| = 2r. The decomposition P = w1 ◦S ◦w2 is considered part of the input.
Output: A string L ∈Σ2r
out that represents the output labeling of S.
Requirement: Any such function f is said to be feasible if the following requirement is met for
any paths S1, S2 and wa, wb, wc, wd such that |S1| = |S2| = 2r and {|wa|, |wb|, |wc|, |wd|} ⊆
[ℓpump, ℓpump + 1]. Let P = wa ◦S1 ◦wb ◦wc ◦S2 ◦wd, and consider the following assignment
of output labels to S1 ∪S2.
• Either label S1 by f(wa ◦S1 ◦wb) or label SR
1 by f(wR
b ◦SR
1 ◦wR
a ).
• Either label S2 by f(wc ◦S2 ◦wd) or label SR
2 by f(wR
d ◦SR
2 ◦wR
c ).
It is required that given such a partial labeling of P, the middle part wb ◦wc can be assigned
output labels in such a way that the labeling of (i) the last r nodes of S1, (ii) all nodes in
wb ◦wc, and (iii) the ﬁrst r nodes of S2 are locally consistent.
The following lemma is a straightforward consequence of the well-known O(log∗n)-round MIS
algorithm on cycles.
Lemma 16. Let G be a cycle graph of n nodes, and let s ≤k be two constant integers such that
s + k ≤n. Then in O(log∗n) rounds we can compute a decomposition V = A ∪B such that each
connected component of A has size s, and each connected component of B has size within [k, k + 1].
Proof. For any given constant integer 1 ≤L < n, we will show that in O(log∗n) time we can ﬁnd
an independent set I of G such that each connected component induced by V \ I has at least L
nodes and at most 2L nodes. Using this result with L = 2(s −1) + k(s + k + 1), it is straightforward
to obtain the desired decomposition V = A ∪B, as follows.
For each v ∈I, it arbitrarily chooses a size-s path Sv that contains v, and all nodes in Sv are
included to A. Now each connected component S′ induced by the remaining nodes is a path of
size at least L −2(s −1) ≥k(s + k + 1) and at most 2L. We will divide the path S′ into subpaths
R1, R2, . . . , Rt meeting the following conditions: (i) if i is odd, then the size of Ri is k or k + 1;
22

--- Page 24 ---
(ii) if i is even, then the size of Ri is s; (iii) t is odd. Hence we obtain the desired decomposition
V = A ∪B if we include the nodes in R1, R3, . . . to B and include the nodes in R2, R4, . . . to A. We
show that such a decomposition of S′ into subpaths R1, R2, . . . , Rt exists. Denote z as the size of
S′. We write z = α(s + k + 1) + β, where α > 0 and 0 ≤β < s + k + 1 are integers. Note that we
must have α ≥k and β ≤2k.
• For the case β ≥k, there is a decomposition R1, R2, . . . , Rt satisﬁes the following conditions:
(i) if i is odd, then the size of Ri is k + 1 when i < t or β when i = t; (ii) if i is even, then the
size of Ri is s; (iii) t = 2α + 1 is odd.
• For the case β < k, there is a decomposition R1, R2, . . . , Rt satisﬁes the following conditions:
(i) if i is odd, then the size of Ri is k when i ∈{1, 3, 5, . . . , 2(k−β)−1}∪{t} or k+1 otherwise;
(ii) if i is even, then the size of Ri is s; (iii) t = 2α + 1 is odd.
For the rest of the proof, we show that in O(log∗n) time we can ﬁnd the required independent
set I. We prove the lemma by an induction on L. The base case of L = 1 is identical to the MIS
problem. Now consider L > 1. By induction hypothesis, we ﬁnd an independent set I′ in O(log∗n)
time such that each connected component induced by V \ I′ has at least L′ nodes and at most 2L′
nodes, where L′ = ⌊L/2⌋. Let G′ be the graph resulting from contracting all nodes in V \ I′, and
we compute an MIS I′′ on this graph G′, which can be done in O(log∗n) rounds in the original
graph G. Note that each connected component S of V \ I′′ has size at least 2L′ + 1 ≥L and at most
3(2L′) + 2. If the size of S is higher than 2L, then we can add some nodes in S to the independent
set I′′ so that the component size of the remaining nodes in S is within [L, 2L].
Lemma 17. If a feasible function f exists, then there is an O(log∗n)-round deterministic LOCAL
algorithm for P on cycles.
Proof. Given that the number of nodes n is at least some large enough constant, in O(log∗n) rounds
we can compute a decomposition V = A ∪B such that each connected component of A has size 2r,
and each connected component of B has size within [2ℓpump, 2ℓpump + 1]. This can be done using
Lemma 16 with s = 2r and k = 2ℓpump. We further decompose each connected component P of
B into two paths P = P1 ◦P2 in such a way that the size of both P1 and P2 are within the range
[ℓpump, ℓpump + 1]. We write P to denote the set of all these paths.
Let S be a connected component of A, and let w1 and w2 be its two neighboring paths in P so
that (w1 ◦S ◦w2) is a subpath of the underlying graph G. The output labels of S are assigned either
by labeling S with f(w1 ◦S ◦w2) or by labeling SR with f(wR
2 ◦SR ◦wR
1 ). At this moment, all
components of A have been assigned output labels using f. By the feasibility of f, each connected
component of B is able to label itself output labels in such a way that the labeling of all nodes are
locally consistent.
Lemma 18. If there is an o(n)-round deterministic LOCAL algorithm A for P on cycles, then a
feasible function f exists.
Proof. Fix s to be some suﬃciently large number, and ﬁx n = 8(s + ℓpump) + 2(2r). We select s to
be large enough so that the runtime of A is smaller than 0.1s. For any given directed path w with
|w| ∈[ℓpump, ℓpump + 1], we ﬁx w+ as the result of applying the pumping lemma (Lemma 14) on w
so that the following two conditions are met: (i) |w+| ∈[s, s + ℓpump] and (ii) Type(w) = Type(w+).

Constructing a Feasible Function f by Simulating A.
The function f(w1 ◦S ◦w2) is
constructed by simulating a given o(n)-round deterministic LOCAL algorithm for P. The output
labeling given by f(w1 ◦S ◦w2) is exactly the result of simulating A on the path P = w+
1 ◦S ◦w+
2
while assuming the number of nodes of the underlying graph is n. Remember that the round
complexity of A is o(n) on n-node graphs. By setting s to be large enough, the runtime of A can be
made smaller than 0.1s. Thus, the calculation of f(w1 ◦S ◦w2) only depends on the IDs and the
input labels of (i) the last 0.1s nodes in w+
1 , (ii) all nodes in S, and (iii) the ﬁrst 0.1s nodes in w+
2 .
In the calculation of f(w1 ◦S ◦w2), the IDs of the nodes that participate in the simulation of A are
chosen arbitrarily so long as they are distinct.
Feasibility of f.
Now we verify that the function f constructed above is feasible. Consider any
choices of paths S1, S2 and wa, wb, wc, wd such that |S1| = |S2| = 2r and {|wa|, |wb|, |wc|, |wd|} ⊆
[ℓpump, ℓpump + 1]. Deﬁne P = wa ◦S1 ◦wb ◦wc ◦S2 ◦wd, and let G be the cycle graph formed by
connecting the two ends of the path P. To show that f is feasible, we need to consider the following
four ways of assigning output labels to S1 ∪S2.
1. Label S1 by f(wa ◦S1 ◦wb); label S2 by f(wc ◦S2 ◦wd).
2. Label S1 by f(wa ◦S1 ◦wb); label SR
2 by f(wR
d ◦SR
2 ◦wR
c ).
3. Label SR
1 by f(wR
b ◦SR
1 ◦wR
a ); label S2 by f(wc ◦S2 ◦wd).
4. Label SR
1 by f(wR
b ◦SR
1 ◦wR
a ); label SR
2 by f(wR
d ◦SR
2 ◦wR
c ).
For each of the above four partial labelings of P, we need to show that the middle part wb ◦wc
can still be assigned output labels in such a way that the labeling of (i) the last r nodes of S1, (ii)
all nodes in wb ◦wc, and (iii) the ﬁrst r nodes of S2 are locally consistent.
Proof of the First Case.
In what follows, we focus on the ﬁrst case, i.e., the partial labeling is
given by labeling S1 by f(wa ◦S1 ◦wb) and labeling S2 by f(wc ◦S2 ◦wd); the proof for the other
three cases are analogous. In this case, we deﬁne P ′ = w+
a ◦S1 ◦w+
b ◦w+
c ◦S2 ◦w+
d , and let G′ be
the cycle graph formed by connecting the two ends of P ′. Note that the number of nodes in G′ is at
most 8(s + ℓpump) + 2(2r) = n. All we need to do is to ﬁnd an output labeling L of G such that the
following conditions are satisﬁed.
(a) The output labels of S1 is given by f(wa ◦S1 ◦wb).
(b) The output labels of S2 is given by f(wc ◦S2 ◦wd).
(c) The labeling of (i) the last r nodes of S1, (ii) all nodes in wb ◦wc, and (iii) the ﬁrst r nodes of
S2 are locally consistent.
We ﬁrst generate an output labeling L′ of G′ by executing A on G′ under the following ID
assignment. The IDs of (i) the last 0.1s nodes in w+
a , (ii) all nodes in S1, and (iii) the ﬁrst 0.1s
nodes in w+
b are chosen as the ones used in the deﬁnition of f(wa ◦S1 ◦wb). Similarly, the IDs of (i)
the last 0.1s nodes in w+
c , (ii) all nodes in S2, and (iii) the ﬁrst 0.1s nodes in w+
d are chosen as the
ones used in the deﬁnition of f(wc ◦S2 ◦wd). The IDs of the rest of the nodes are chosen arbitrarily
so long as when we run A on G′, no node sees two nodes with the same ID. Due to the way we
deﬁne f, the output labeling L′ of the subpath S1 is exactly given by f(wa ◦S1 ◦wb), and the output
labeling L′ of S2 is exactly f(wc ◦S2 ◦wd). Due to the correctness of A, L′ is a legal labeling.
We transform the output labeling L′ of G′ to a desired output labeling L of G. Remember that
G is the result of replacing the four subpaths w+ of G′ by w, and we have Type(w+) = Type(w). In
view of Lemma 11, there is a legal labeling L of G such that all nodes in S1 and S2 are labeled the
same as in G′. Therefore, the labeling L satisﬁes the above three conditions (a), (b), and (c).
24

--- Page 26 ---
The Other Cases.
We brieﬂy discuss how we modify the proof to deal with the other three
cases. For example, consider the second case, where the partial labeling is given by labeling S1 by
f(wa ◦S1 ◦wb) and labeling SR
2 by f(wR
d ◦SR
2 ◦wR
c ). In this case, the path P ′ is deﬁned as
P ′ = w+
a ◦S1 ◦w+
b ◦
 (wR
c )+R ◦SR
2 ◦
 (wR
d )+R .
During the ID assignment of G′, the IDs of (i) the last 0.1s nodes in w+
c , (ii) all nodes in S2, and
(iii) the ﬁrst 0.1s nodes in w+
d are now chosen as the ones used in the deﬁnition of f(wR
d ◦SR
2 ◦wR
c ).
Using such an ID assignment, the output labeling L′ of SR
2 as the result of executing A on G′ will
be exactly the same as the output labeling given by f(wR
d ◦SR
2 ◦wR
c ). The rest of the proof is the
same.
Theorem 8 follows from the above two lemmas. The decidability result is due to the simple
observation that whether a feasible function exists is decidable.
4.3
Partitioning a Cycle
In the following sections, we prove the decidability result associated with the ω(1)—o(log∗n) gap.
In this proof, we also deﬁne a feasible function, prove its decidability, and show the existence given
an o(log∗n)-time algorithm. The main challenge here is that an MIS cannot be computed in O(1)
time. To solve this issue, we decompose a cycle into paths with unrepetitive patterns and paths
with repetitive patterns. For paths with unrepetitive patterns, we are able to compute a suﬃciently
well-spaced MIS in O(1) time by making use of the irregularity of the input patterns.
Section 4.3 considers an O(1)-round algorithm that partitions a cycle into some short paths
and some paths that have a repeated input pattern. Section 4.4 deﬁnes a feasible function whose
existence characterizes the O(1)-round solvable LCL problems. In Section 4.5, we prove Theorem 9.
Partitioning an Undirected Cycle into Directed Paths.
Let G be a cycle graph.
An
orientation of a node v is an assignment to one of its neighbor, this can be speciﬁed using port-
numbering. An orientation of the nodes in G is called ℓ-orientation if the following condition is met.
If |V (G)| ≤ℓ, then all nodes in G are oriented to the same direction. If |V (G)| > ℓ, then each node
v ∈V (G) belongs to a path P such that (i) all nodes in P are oriented to the same direction, and
(ii) the number of nodes in P is at least ℓ. In O(1) rounds we can compute an ℓ-orientation of G for
any constant ℓ.
Lemma 19 ([6]). Let G be a cycle graph. Let ℓbe a constant. There is a deterministic LOCAL
algorithm that computes an ℓ-orientation of G in O(1) rounds.
In this section, we will use a generalization of an ℓ-orientation that satisﬁes an additional
requirement that the input labels of each directed path P in the decomposition with |V (P)| > 2ℓwidth
(where 2ℓwidth is a threshold) must form a periodic string (whose period length is at most ℓpattern).
A string w ∈Σ∗
in is called primitive if w cannot be written as xi for some x ∈Σ∗
in and i ≥2. Let
G be a cycle graph or a path graph where each node v ∈V (G) has an input label from Σin. We
deﬁne an (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition as a partition of G into a set of connected subgraphs P
meeting the following criteria. We assume |V (G)| > 2ℓwidth and ℓpattern ≥ℓwidth.
Direction and Minimum Length: For each P ∈P, the nodes in P are oriented to the same
direction, and |V (P)| ≥ℓwidth.
25

--- Page 27 ---
Short Paths: Deﬁne Pshort as the subset of P that contains paths having at most 2ℓwidth
nodes. For each directed path P = (v1, . . . , vk) ∈Pshort, each node vi in P knows its rank i.
Long Paths: Deﬁne Plong = P \ Pshort. Then the input labeling of the nodes in P is of the
form wk for some primitive string w ∈Σ∗
in such that |w| ≤ℓpattern and k ≥ℓcount. Moreover,
each node v in P knows the string w.
Note that P may contain a cycle. This is possible only when G is a cycle where the input
labeling is a repetition (at least ℓcount times) of a primitive string w ∈Σ∗
in of length at most ℓpattern.
In this case, we must have P = Plong = {G}. Otherwise, P contains only paths.
The goal of this section is to show that an (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition can be found in O(1)
rounds. First of all, in Lemma 20 we demonstrate how we can break symmetry in O(1) rounds
given that the underlying graph is directed and the input labels does not form long periodic strings.
Let G be a path or a cycle. A set I ⊆V (G) is called an (α, β)-independent set if the following
conditions are met: (i) I is an independent set, and I does not contain either endpoint of G (if G is
a path), and (ii) each connected component induced by V \ I has at least α nodes and at most β
nodes, unless |V | ≤α, in which case we allow I = ∅. Note that ﬁnding an (α, β)-independent set
takes O(log∗n) rounds in general, but in Lemma 20 we show that by leveraging the “irregularity”
of input labels, we can do this in O(1) rounds on directed paths or cycles without periodic patterns.
Lemma 20. Let γ and ℓbe any two constants with ℓ≥γ. Let G be a directed cycle or a directed
path that does not contain any subpath of the form wx, with |w| ≤γ and |wx| ≥ℓ. There is a
deterministic LOCAL algorithm that computes an (γ, 2γ)-independent set I of G in O(1) rounds.
Proof. For the case G is a directed path P = (s, . . . , t), deﬁne V ′ as the set of nodes in G whose
distance to t is at least ℓ−1. For the case G is a directed cycle, deﬁne V ′ = V (G). In what follows,
we focus on ﬁnding an (γ, 2γ)-independent set I′ of the nodes in V ′. Extending the set I′ to produce
the desired independent set I can be done with extra O(1) rounds.
Recall that G is directed. Deﬁne the color of a node v ∈V ′ by the sequence of the ℓinput labels
of v and the ℓ−1 nodes following v in G. For each node v ∈V ′, there is no other node within
distance γ to v having the same color as v, since otherwise we can ﬁnd a subpath whose input labels
form a string wx, with |w| ≤γ and |wx| ≥ℓ. By applying the standard procedure that computes an
MIS from a coloring, within O(1) rounds a (γ, 2γ)-independent set I′ can be obtained.
Using Lemma 20, we ﬁrst show that an (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition can be found in O(1)
rounds for the case G is directed. That is, all nodes in G are initially oriented to the same direction,
and we are allowed to re-orient the nodes.
Lemma 21. Let G be a directed cycle or a directed path where each node v ∈V (G) has an input label
from Σin, and |V (G)| > 2ℓwidth. Let ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern be three constants such that ℓpattern ≥ℓwidth.
There is a deterministic LOCAL algorithm that computes an (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition in O(1)
rounds
Proof. Let (w1, w2, . . . , wk) be any ordering of the primitive strings in Σ∗
in of length at most ℓpattern.
First, construct a set of subgraphs Plong as follows. Initialize U = V (G) and Plong = ∅. For i = 1 to
k, execute the following procedure. Let Si be the set of maximal-size connected subgraphs formed by
nodes in U such that the input labels form the string wx
i with x ≥ℓcount + 2ℓwidth. Each node v ∈U
in O(1) rounds checks if v belongs to a subgraph in Si; if so, remove v from U. For each P ∈Si,
26

--- Page 28 ---
deﬁne P ′ as follows. If P is a cycle, then P ′ = P. If P is a path, then P ′ is the result of removing
all nodes that are within distance ℓwidth|wi| −1 to an endpoint in P. Note that each node v in P
knows whether v belongs to P ′. Deﬁne S′
i = {P ′|P ∈Si}, and then update Plong ←Plong ∪S′
i.
It is straightforward to verify that each path or cycle P ∈Plong satisﬁes the requirement in the
deﬁnition of (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition. Deﬁne the set of subgraphs Pirreg as the connected
components of the nodes not in any subgraph in Plong. Deﬁne ℓ= (ℓpattern + 2ℓwidth) · ℓcount. By
our construction, the input labeling in each subgraph P ∈Pirreg does not contain any substring
wx, with 1 ≤|w| ≤ℓpattern and |wx| ≥ℓ. An (ℓpattern, 2ℓpattern)-independent set of each P ∈Pirreg
can be computed using Lemma 20 in O(1) rounds. Observe that each subgraph P ∈Pirreg has at
least ℓwidth nodes. Given an (ℓpattern, 2ℓpattern)-independent set of a subgraph P ∈Pirreg, in O(1)
rounds P can be partitioned into subpaths, each of which contains at least ℓpattern nodes and at
most 2ℓpattern nodes. This ﬁnishes the construction of an (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition.
Combining Lemma 21 and Lemma 19, we are able to construct an (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition
in O(1) rounds for undirected graphs.
Lemma 22. Let G be a cycle or a path where each node v ∈V (G) has an input label from Σin, and
|V (G)| > 2ℓwidth. Let ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern be three constants such that ℓpattern ≥ℓwidth. There is a
deterministic LOCAL algorithm that computes an (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition in O(1) rounds
Proof. The algorithm is as follows. Compute an ℓ-orientation of G by Lemma 19 in O(1) rounds
with ℓ= 2ℓwidth + 1. For each maximal-length connected subgraph P where each constituent node
is oriented to the same direction, ﬁnd an (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition of P in O(1) rounds by
Lemma 21.
4.4
Feasible Function
The goal of this section is to deﬁne a feasible function whose existence characterizes the O(1)-round
solvable LCL problems. With respect to an LCL problem P and a function f which takes a string
w ∈Σk
in with 1 ≤k ≤ℓpump as input, and returns a string f(w) ∈Σk
out, we deﬁne some partially or
completely labeled path graphs which are used in the deﬁnition of a feasible function.
Completely Labeled Graph Gw,z: Let w ∈Σ∗
in be any string of length at least 1 and at most
ℓpump. Let z be any non-negative integer. Deﬁne Gw,z = (Gw,z, L) as follows. The graph Gw,z
is a path of the form wr ◦wz ◦wr. The labeling L is a complete labeling of the form f(w)z+2r.
Deﬁne Mid(Gw,z) as the middle subpath wz of Gw,z.
Partially Labeled Graph Gw1,w2,S: Let w1, w2 ∈Σ∗
in be any two strings of length at least 1 and
at most ℓpump. Let S ∈Σ∗
in be any string (can be empty). Deﬁne Gw1,w2,S = (Gw1,w2,S, L) as
follows. The graph Gw1,w2,S is the path of the form wℓpump+2r
1
◦S ◦wℓpump+2r
2
. The labeling
L is a partial labeling of Gw1,w2,S which ﬁxes the output labels of the ﬁrst 2r|w1| and the
last 2r|w2| nodes by f(w1)2r and f(w2)2r, respectively. Deﬁne Mid(Gw1,w2,S) as the middle
subpath wℓpump+r
1
◦S ◦wℓpump+r
2
of Gw1,w2,S.
Feasible Function: We call f a feasible function if the following conditions are met: (i) For each
Gw,z = (Gw,z, L), the complete labeling L is locally consistent at all nodes in Mid(Gw,z). (ii)
Each partially labeled graph Gw1,w2,S admits a complete labeling L⋄that is locally consistent
at all nodes in Mid(Gw1,w2,S).
Lemma 23. Given an LCL problem P on cycle graphs. It is decidable whether there is a feasible
function.
27

--- Page 29 ---
Proof. Note that it is not immediate from its deﬁnition as to whether a feasible function exists is
decidable, since there appears to be inﬁnitely many graphs Gw,z and Gw1,w2,S needed to be examined.
However, the following simple observations show that it suﬃces to check only a constant number of
these graphs.
• If the complete labeling L of Gw,1 = (Gw,1, L) is locally consistent at all nodes in Mid(Gw,1),
then for all z ≥1, the complete labeling L of Gw,z = (Gw,z, L) is also locally consistent at all
nodes in Mid(Gw,z).
• If Gw1,w2,S admits a complete labeling L⋄that is locally consistent at all nodes in Mid(Gw1,w2,S),
then for each S′ such that Type(S) = Type(S′), the partially labeled graph Gw1,w2,S′ also
admits a complete labeling L⋄that is locally consistent at all nodes in Mid(Gw1,w2,S′). This is
due to Lemma 11.
Therefore, to decide whether a function f is feasible, we only need to check all possible Gw,z and
Gw1,w2,S. For each w we only need to consider the graph Gw,z with z = 1. For each w1 and w2, we
do not need to go over all S; we only need to consider (i) the empty string S = ∅, and (ii) for each
type τ, a string S ∈Σ∗
in such that Type(S) = τ. By Lemma 14, for each type τ, there exists P ∈Σx
in
with x ≤ℓpump such that Type(P) = τ. Therefore, a string S with Type(S) = τ can be found in
bounded amount of time; also note that the number of types is bounded; see Lemma 13.
For the rest of this section, we show that as long as the deterministic LOCAL complexity of
P is o(log∗n) on cycle graphs, there exists a feasible function f. In Lemma 24 we show how to
extract a function f from a given o(log∗n)-round deterministic LOCAL algorithm A, and then in
Lemma 25 we prove that such a function f is feasible. Intuitively, Lemma 24 shows that there exists
an ID-assignment such that when we run A on a subpath whose input labeling is a repetition of a
length-k pattern w, the output labeling is also a repetition of a length-k pattern w′. The function f
will be deﬁned as f(w) = w′.
Lemma 24. Let A be any deterministic LOCAL algorithm that solves P in t(n) = o(log∗n) rounds.
Then there is a number n′ and function f which takes a string w ∈Σk
in with 1 ≤k ≤ℓpump as input,
and returns a string f(w) ∈Σk
out meeting the following condition. For any P = wi ◦w2r+1 ◦wi such
that |wi| ≥t(n′) and 1 ≤|w| ≤ℓpump, there is an assignment of distinct Θ(log n′)-bit IDs to the
nodes in P such that the following is true. Simulating A on P while assuming that the total number
of nodes in the underlying graph is n′ yields the output labeling f(w)2r+1 for the middle subpath
w2r+1.
Proof. In this proof we assume that there is no such a number n′. Then we claim that using A it is
possible to obtain a deterministic LOCAL algorithm for MIS on an n-node directed cycle G without
input labeling, in O(t(n)) + O(1) = o(log∗n) rounds. This contradicts the well-known Ω(log∗n)
lower bound for MIS [20].
Let G be an n-node directed cycle without input labeling. The MIS algorithm on G is described
as follows. Let w ∈Σk
in with 1 ≤k ≤ℓpump be chosen such that for any function f, the string
f(w) ∈Σk
out does not satisfy the conditions stated in the lemma for the number n′ = nk. Deﬁne
G′ as the graph resulting from replacing each node v ∈V (G) with a path w. We can simulate the
imaginary graph G′ in the communication network G by letting each node v ∈V (G) simulate a
path w.
We execute the algorithm A on G′ while assuming that the total number of nodes is n′. The
execution takes t(n′) = O(t(n)) rounds. For each node v ∈V (G), deﬁne the color of v as the
sequence of the output labels of the path w2r simulated by the node v and the 2r −1 nodes following
28

--- Page 30 ---
v in the directed cycle G. This gives us a proper O(1)-coloring, since otherwise there must exist
a subpath P = w2r+1 of G′ such that the output labeling of P is of the form y2r+1 for some y,
contradicting our choice of w. Using the standard procedure of computing an MIS from a coloring,
with extra O(1) rounds, an MIS of G can be obtained.
Note that there is a subtle issue about how we set the IDs of nodes in V (G′). The following
method is guaranteed to output distinct IDs. Let v ∈V (G), and let u1, . . . , uk be the nodes in
V (G′) simulated by v. Then we may use ID(ui) = k · ID(v) + i.
Lemma 25. Suppose that the deterministic LOCAL complexity of P is o(log∗n) on cycle graphs.
Then there exists a feasible function f.
Proof. Let A be any deterministic LOCAL algorithm that solves P in t(n) = o(log∗n) rounds. Let
n′ and f be chosen to meet the conditions in Lemma 24 for A. The goal of the proof is to show
that f is a feasible function. According to the conditions speciﬁed in Lemma 24 for the function f,
we already know that the complete labeling L of each Gw,z = (Gw,z, L) is locally consistent at all
nodes in Mid(Gw,z). Therefore, all we need to do is the following. For each partially labeled graph
Gw1,w2,S, ﬁnd a complete labeling L⋄that is locally consistent at all nodes in Mid(Gw1,w2,S).
Given the three parameters w1, w2, and S, deﬁne G as the cycle resulting from linking the
two ends of the path wℓpump
1
◦w2r+1
1
◦wℓpump
1
◦S ◦wℓpump
2
◦w2r+1
2
◦wℓpump
2
. Deﬁne L as the partial
labeling of G which ﬁxes the output labeling of the two subpaths w2r+1
1
and w2r+1
2
by f(w1)2r+1
and f(w2)2r+1, respectively. We write P mid
1
and P mid
2
to denote the two subpaths w2r+1
1
and w2r+1
2
,
respectively.
In what follows, we show that the partially labeled graph G = (G, L) admits a legal labeling L⋄.
Since Gw1,w2,S is a subgraph of G = (G, L), such a legal labeling L⋄is also a complete labeling of
Gw1,w2,S that is locally consistent at all nodes in Mid(Gw1,w2,S).
For the rest of the proof, we show the existence of L⋄. This will be established by applying a
pumping lemma. Deﬁne the graph G′ as the result of the following operations on G.
• Replace the two subpaths wℓpump
1
by wx
1, where the number x is chosen such that x|w1| ≥
2t(n′) + r, and Type(wℓpump
1
) = Type(wx
1).
• Replace the two subpaths wℓpump
2
by wy
2, where the number y is chosen such that y|w2| ≥
2t(n′) + r, and Type(wℓpump
2
) = Type(wy
2).
The existence of the numbers x and y above is guaranteed by Lemma 15. The IDs of nodes in G′ are
assigned as follows. For i = 1, 2, select the IDs of the nodes in S
v∈P mid
i
Nt(n′)(v) in such a way that
the output labeling of P mid
i
resulting from executing A on G′ while assuming that the total number
of nodes is n′ is f(wi)2r+1. The existence of such an ID assignment is guaranteed by Lemma 24. For
all remaining nodes in G′, select their IDs in such a way that all nodes in Nr+t(n′)(v) receive distinct
IDs, for each v ∈V (G′). This ensures that the outcome of executing A on G′ while assuming that
the total number of nodes is n′ is a legal labeling.
Let L′
⋄be the legal labeling of G′ resulting from executing A with the above IDs while pretending
that the total number of nodes is n′. Note that L′
⋄must label P mid
1
and P mid
2
by f(w1)2r+1 and
f(w2)2r+1, respectively. A desired legal labeling L⋄of G can be obtained from the legal labeling L′
⋄of
G′ by applying Lemma 11, as we have Type(wℓpump

) = Type(wx
1) and Type(wℓpump
2
) = Type(wy
2).

The ω(1)—o(log∗n) Gap
In this section we prove that it is decidable whether a given LCL problem P has complexity Ω(log∗n)
or O(1) on cycle graphs.

Lemma 26. Let f be any feasible function. Let G be any cycle graph. Let P be any set of
disjoint subgraphs in G such that the input labeling of each P ∈P is of the form wx such that
x ≥2ℓpump + 2r, and w ∈Σk
in is a string with 1 ≤k ≤ℓpump. For each P ∈P, deﬁne the subgraph
P ′ as follows. If P is a cycle, deﬁne P ′ = P. If P is a path, write P = wℓpump ◦wi ◦wℓpump, and
deﬁne P ′ as the middle subpath wi. Let L be a partial labeling of G deﬁned as follows. For each
P = wx ∈P, ﬁx the output labels of each subpath w of P ′ by f(w). Then G = (G, L) admits a legal
labeling L⋄.
Proof. Deﬁne V1 as the set of all nodes such that v ∈V1 if v belongs to the middle subpath wj
of some path P = wℓpump ◦wr ◦wj ◦wr ◦wℓpump ∈P. By the deﬁnition of feasible function, L is
already locally consistent at all nodes in V1. Thus, all we need to do is to construct a complete
labeling L⋄of G = (G, L), and argue that L⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in V2 = V (G) \ V1.
There are two easy special cases. If P = ∅, then no output label of any node in G is ﬁxed, and
so G trivially admits a legal labeling. If P contains a cycle, then P = {G}, and hence L is already
a legal labeling as V1 = V (G).
In subsequent discussion, we restrict ourselves to the case that P is non-empty and contains only
paths. The output labeling L⋄is constructed as follows. Deﬁne Punlabeled as the maximal-length
subpaths of G that are not assigned any output labels by L. A path P ∈Punlabeled must be of the
form wℓpump
1
◦S ◦wℓpump
2
, where w1, w2 ∈Σ∗
in are two strings of length at least 1 and at most ℓpump,
and S ∈Σ∗
in can be any string (including the empty string). Given P ∈Punlabeled, we make the
following deﬁnitions.
• Deﬁne P + as the subpath of G that includes P and the r|w1| nodes preceding P, and the
r|w2| nodes following P in the graph G. Note that the set V2 is exactly the union of nodes in
P + for all P ∈Punlabeled.
• Deﬁne P ++ as the subpath of G that includes P and the 2r|w1| nodes preceding P, and the
2r|w2| nodes following P in the graph G. The path P ++ must be of the form wℓpump+2r
1
◦S ◦
wℓpump+2r
2
, and the labeling L already ﬁxes the output labels of the ﬁrst 2r|w1| and the last
2r|w2| nodes of P ++ by f(w1)2r and f(w2)2r, respectively.
Observe that the path P ++ = wℓpump+2r
1
◦S ◦wℓpump+2r
2
together with the labeling L is exactly the
partially labeled graph Gw1,w2,S. We assign the output labels to the nodes in P by the labeling
L⋄guaranteed in the deﬁnition of feasible function. It is ensured that the labeling of all nodes
within P + are locally consistent. By doing so for each P ∈Punlabeled, we obtain a desired complete
labeling that is locally consistent at all nodes in V2.
Lemma 27. Suppose that there is a feasible function f for the LCL problem P. Then there is an
O(1)-round deterministic LOCAL algorithm A on cycle graphs.
Proof. The ﬁrst step of the algorithm A is to compute an (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition in O(1)
rounds by Lemma 22. We set ℓcount = 2ℓpump + 2r and ℓwidth = ℓpattern = ℓpump. We assume
|V (G)| > 2ℓwidth. Recall that an (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition decomposes the cycle G into two
sets of disjoint subgraphs Pshort and Plong.
Deﬁne G′ as the graph resulting from applying the following operations on G.
For each
P ∈Pshort, replace the path P by the path P ∗= x ◦yi ◦z such that i = ℓcount, 1 ≤|y| ≤ℓpattern,
and the type of P ∗is the same as the type of P. The path P ∗is obtained via Lemma 14. Note that
each path P ∈Pshort has at least ℓwidth = ℓpump nodes and at most 2ℓwidth = 2ℓpump nodes. Deﬁne
P∗as the set of all P ∗such that P ∈Pshort. The graph G′ is simulated in the communication
graph G by electing a leader for each path P ∈Pshort to simulate P ∗.

Calculate a partial labeling L′ of G′ using the feasible function f as follows. Recall ℓcount =
2ℓpump + 2r. For each P ∗= x ◦yℓpump ◦y2r ◦yℓpump ◦z ∈P∗, label the middle subpath y2r by the
function f. For each P = wℓpump ◦wi ◦wℓpump ∈Plong, label the middle subpath wi by f(w)i. Even
though a path P ∈Plong can have ω(1) nodes, this step can be done locally in O(1) rounds due to
the following property of (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition. All nodes in a path P ∈Plong agree with
the same direction and know the primitive string w.
By Lemma 26, the remaining unlabeled nodes in G′ can be labeled to yield a legal labeling of
G′. This can be done in O(1) rounds since the connected components formed by unlabeled nodes
have at most O(1) nodes. Given any valid labeling of G′, a legal labeling of G can be obtained by
applying Lemma 11 in O(1) rounds. Remember that Type(P) = Type(P ∗) for each P ∈Pshort, and
G′ is exactly the result of replacing each P ∈Pshort by P ∗.
See Figure 5 for an illustration of Lemma 27: (1) applying a pumping lemma to extend each
path P ∈Pshort; (2) labeling the middle subpath y2r of P ∗= x ◦yℓpump ◦y2r ◦yℓpump ◦z ∈P∗and
the middle subpath wj of P ′ = wℓpump ◦wi ◦wℓpump ∈Plong by the function f; (3) the remaining
unlabeled nodes in G′ can be labeled to yield a legal labeling of G′ by Lemma 26; (4) since
Type(P) = Type(P ∗) for each P ∈Pshort, we can recover a legal labeling of G by re-labeling nodes
in each P ∈Pshort.
Combining Lemma 23, Lemma 25, and Lemma 27, we have proved Theorem 9. That is, for any
LCL problem P on cycle graphs, its deterministic LOCAL complexity is either Ω(log∗n) or O(1).
Moreover, there is an algorithm that decides whether P has complexity Ω(log∗n) or O(1) on cycle
graphs; for the case the complexity is O(1), the algorithm outputs a description of an O(1)-round
deterministic LOCAL algorithm that solves P.

Deciding Feasible-Function Existence for
β-Normalized, Radius-1 LCLs on Directed Paths is
in NEXPTIME
Abstract
We give a nondeterministic 2poly(β)-time algorithm that decides,
for a β-normalized, radius-1 LCL on globally oriented paths, whether
there exists a feasible function. This decides both gaps O(log∗n) vs.
Θ(n) (mid-consistency) and O(1) vs. Ω(log∗n) (bridging). Our proof
is self-contained modulo standard pumping/replacement facts for path
types; we restate the exact type bound, give a finite-checks lemma with
an explicit z-bound Z ≤ℓ2
pump, spell out the DP used by the verifier
(with boundary handling and tight O(kβ2) complexity), and prove
soundness/completeness. We use Section 4 and Lemmas 10–15, 11, 12,
as well as Theorems 8–9 from the reference.1
1
Model and Normalization (r=1)
We work on globally oriented paths. A β-normalized LCL is given by
Σin = {0, 1},
|Σout| = β,
Cin–out ⊆Σin × Σout,
Cout–out ⊆Σout × Σout,
and a labeling is legal iff (in(v), out(v)) ∈Cin–out for each node v and
(out(u), out(v)) ∈Cout–out for each directed edge u →v. The input size is
N = poly(β).
Types and pumping for r = 1.
For a path P = (u1, . . . , uk) with k ≥4,
define B1 = {u1, uk} and B2 = {u2, uk−1}. Two paths are type-equivalent if
1All background references (lemmas, constructions, and the two gap theorems) refer to
the uploaded PDF: The distributed complexity of locally checkable problems on paths is
decidable. See Section 4 (pp. 19–32), especially Lemmas 10–15 (types/pumping), Lemma 11
(replacement), Lemma 12 (type composition), and Theorems 8–9 (gap characterizations).

(i) inputs on B1 ∪B2 match and (ii) the same boundary-output assignments
on B1 ∪B2 are extendible. Let Type(P) be the type. Counting: there are
24 choices for boundary inputs and a yes/no choice for each of β4 boundary-
output 4-tuples, so
M := |{Type(P)}| ≤24 · 2β4 = 2β4+4 = 2Θ(β4).
Set ℓpump := M. The DFA view of types and pumping/replacement lemmas
are in Section 4: Lemma 12 (type composition), Lemmas 10–11 (replacement),
and Lemmas 14–15 (pumping/periodicity).2

Contexts and Feasible Functions (no circularity)
Fix ℓpump. A context is any triple (w1, S, w2) with |w1|, |w2| ∈{ℓpump, ℓpump+1}
and S ∈Σ2
in. We identify contexts by the type of the concatenation w1Sw2.
Thus the set C of context types is a subset of the global type space, indepen-
dent of f.
Definition 1 (Feasible function). A map f : C →Σ2
out is feasible if:
• (F1) Mid-consistency. For any contexts waS1wb and wcS2wd, the
fixed outputs f(Type(waS1wb)) on S1 and f(Type(wcS2wd)) on S2
extend to a legal labeling of waS1 wbwc S2wd.
• (F2) Bridging. For any context (w1, S, w2) and all z ≥1, the fixed
outputs f(Type(w1Sw2)) on S extend to a legal labeling of wz
1Swz
2.
These are precisely the certificates that characterize the two gaps on cy-
cles/paths: (F1) ⇔O(log∗n) vs. Θ(n), and (F1)+(F2) ⇔O(1) vs. Ω(log∗n).3

a, b > 0 with a + b ≤ℓpump such that Type(wat+b) is independent of t ≥0.4
Why: consider the finite set of types T , |T | = ℓpump, and the self-map
Fw : T →T that composes by w. The sequence Ti := F i
w(T0) (here T0 is the
type of the empty prefix) has a repetition Tp = Tq with 1 ≤p < q ≤ℓpump;
setting a = q −p, b = p gives a + b = q ≤ℓpump and Tat+b constant for all
t ≥0. This is the standard orbit argument behind Lemma 15.
Lemma 1 (Finite z for bridging). Fix a context (w1, S, w2). There exist
parameters (ai, bi) for wi with ai+bi ≤ℓpump such that Type(wait+bi
i
) is t-
invariant. Hence the pair
 Type(wz
1), Type(wz
2)

takes at most a1a2 ≤ℓ2
pump
distinct values, and by type composition (Lemma 12) Type(wz
1Swz
2) also takes
at most ℓ2
pump values. Consequently, there exists Z ≤ℓ2
pump with
∀z ≥1 ∃z′ ∈{1, . . . , Z} : Type(wz
1Swz
2) = Type(wz′
1 Swz′
2 ).
Thus (F2) holds iff the partial outputs on S extend for all z ∈{1, . . . , Z}.
Proof. Apply Lemma 15 to each wi (periodicity), and use Lemma 12 (type
composition) to conclude that the type of wz
1Swz
2 is determined by the pair
of side types, whence the bound by pigeonhole. Extendibility depends only
on the resulting type and the fixed outputs on S (by the replacement lemma,
Lemma 11), so a single representative per type suffice.5
How we pick Z in practice.
We will use the worst-case bound Z = ℓ2
pump;
this keeps the algorithm simple and does not affect the asymptotic bound.
(Optional refinement: for a fixed context, compute the cycle structure of
Fw1 and Fw2 in the type DFA and set Z to the lcm of periods times the
max preperiod—still ≤ℓ2
pump—which can reduce constants while remaining
2poly(β) overall.)

Deterministic DP for extendibility (with precise
complexity)
All checks reduce to deciding if a partially labeled path admits a completion.

Layered automaton.
Given a path P = (v1, . . . , vk) and a set F of forced
positions with outputs oi ∈Σout, build k layers, one per position. Layer i
keeps the set
Li := {x ∈Σout : ( in(vi), x ) ∈Cin–out and if i ∈F, x = oi}.
Insert a directed edge x →y from layer i to i+1 iff (x, y) ∈Cout–out. There
is a legal completion iff the layered graph has a path from some state in layer
1 to some state in layer k.
Running time and memory.
Let k = |P|. Constructing layers and edges
takes O(k · |Cout–out|) time, which is O(kβ2) in the worst case, and O(kβ)
memory. Forced nodes reduce the number of states (they do not increase
complexity): the check is a standard reachability on this DAG, also in O(kβ2)
time.
5
Nondeterministic algorithm and correctness
Precomputation (deterministic, 2poly(β))
1. Enumerate all types T by exploring the boundary-extendibility DFA
(Lemma 12), set ℓpump = |T | ≤2Θ(β4).6
2. For each type t ∈T and each boundary assignment on B1 ∪B2, pre-
compute extendible? via DP on a fixed representative of type t (length
O(ℓpump)).
3. Compute the set C ⊆T of context types: those realized by some w1Sw2
with |wi| ∈{ℓpump, ℓpump+1} and |S| = 2. Note |C| ≤ℓpump.
Guess
Nondeterministically guess f(τ) ∈Σ2
out for every τ ∈C.
Verify (deterministic, 2poly(β))
(V1) Mid-consistency. For each ordered pair of contexts (waS1wb, wcS2wd), run the DP on
waS1 wbwc S2wd with the two 2-node windows S1, S2 forced to f; accept
only if the DP succeeds. Why no extra buffers: by definition of contexts,
6Type DFA and counting bound: Lemma 13 (p. 22) specialized to r=1 gives |T | ≤24·2β4.

wb, wc each has length ℓpump or ℓpump+1, so the underlined bridge wbwc
is already a long buffer for the replacement lemmas.
(V2) Bridging. For each context (w1, S, w2) and each z = 1, . . . , Z with Z = ℓ2
pump from
Lemma 1, run the DP on wz
1Swz
2 with the two nodes of S forced to f.
(All seams internal to wz
1 and wz
2 are covered by this DP; no separate
”seam test” is needed.)
Theorem 1 (Soundness and completeness). If the verifier accepts some
guessed f, then f satisfies (F1) and (F2); conversely, if a feasible f exists,
some guess passes (V1)–(V2).
Proof sketch. (V1) is exactly (F1). For (F2), Lemma 1 shows it suffices to
check z ≤Z; (V2) performs those checks with a DP that validates all local
constraints, including seams created by repetition. Conversely, a feasible f
passes (V1) and by Lemma 1 also passes (V2) for all z ≤Z, hence for all
z.
Complexity and main theorem
Precomputation explores T and runs DPs on O(ℓpump)-length words, all in
2poly(β) time. Verification runs a polynomial number of DPs on strings of
length O(ℓ3
pump) (worst case, from z ≤ℓ2
pump and context width O(ℓpump)),
each in O(kβ2); altogether 2poly(β) = 2poly(N) time.
Theorem 2 (Main). Feasible-Function Existence for β-normalized,
radius-1 LCLs on directed paths is in NEXPTIME.

Connection to the two gaps
We use the standard implications:
• (F1) ⇒O(log∗n) and failure of (F1) ⇒Θ(n) (Theorem 8, with MIS-
based decomposition, Lemma 16).7

General r > 1 (remark).
All arguments lift to any fixed radius r: the
type space size becomes 2poly(βO(r)) (cf. Lemma 13), the DP has βO(r) states
per layer, and Lemma 1 still yields a finite Z from the same periodicity
argument.10
A
Optional algebraic view (boolean matrices with
the seam)
Let A ∈{0, 1}β×β be the adjacency of Cout–out: A[x, y] = 1 ⇐⇒(x, y) ∈
Cout–out. For a word w, define Cw ∈{0, 1}β×β by (Cw)ij = 1 iff there is a legal
labeling of w whose first/last outputs are i/j and nodewise (in(·), out(·)) ∈
Cin–out. Then boolean multiplication gives the exact composition law
Cxy = Cx A Cy,
hence
Cwz = Cw (ACw)z−1.
Proof: (i, k) ∈Cxy iff there exists j such that (i, j) ∈Cx, (j, k) ∈Cy, and
the seam output pair is legal, i.e. (j, ·) to (·, k) goes through an edge in
A—which is exactly the middle factor. This algebraic view is not needed for
the algorithm (the DP already checks seams), but it explains the role of the
seam explicitly.

NEXPTIME-hardness (explicit β-normalized radius-
1 model)
We prove that Feasible-Function Existence (mid-consistency (F1) only)
for β-normalized, radius-1 LCLs on globally oriented paths is NEXPTIME-
hard. Together with Theorem 2, this yields NEXPTIME-completeness. The
reduction is from Succinct-3SAT: a circuit C of size s defines, for each index
j ∈{0, 1}B, a 3-clause clause(j) over variables x1, . . . , x2B; the question is
whether the 2B-variable CNF ΦC is satisfiable.
What we use from the toolbox.
We rely on (i) the types/replacement/pumping
machinery (Lemmas 10–12, 14–15 in §4 of the reference), and (ii) the error-
chain technique to make malformed encodings harmless (as in §3 of the
reference).11
B.1
Target: FFE(F1) for β-normalized r=1
Recall our feasible-function existence problem FFE(F1): given Σin = {0, 1},
|Σout| = β, Cin–out ⊆Σin×Σout, Cout–out ⊆Σout×Σout, decide if there is a
map f : C →Σ2
out (on context types) satisfying mid-consistency (F1), cf. the
definition in the upper bound section.
B.2
Source and parameters
Let C be a succinct 3CNF generator of size s. Set
B = sc0,
β = sc1,
for large enough absolute constants c0 ≪c1 fixed below. We will build, in
poly(s) time, a β-normalized LCL PC = (Σin, Σout, Cin–out, Cout–out) such
that
ΦC is satisfiable
⇐⇒FFE(F1) holds for PC.
(1)
Since |Σout| = β = poly(s), the type space size ℓpump := |{Type(·)}| satisfies
ℓpump ≤2Θ(β4) = 2poly(s), and hence the contexts in C (those realized by
w1Sw2 with |wi| ∈{ℓpump, ℓpump+1}) cover exponentially many patterns,
which we will exploit.12

B.3
The block language and the verifiers
We describe Σout and the two verifiers in the β-normalized form.
The
construction follows the standard ”copy input and check a tableau by nearest-
neighbor rules” recipe, together with the error-chain gadget that guarantees
malformed inputs never constrain f.13
Alphabet Σout.
Each output symbol encodes a constant number of tracks:
(T1) a bit in which must copy the node’s input bit (enforced by Cin–out);
(T2) a role from a constant set {HEAD, RID, GID, RUN, PAD} and a constant-
size phase (synchronization);
(T3) three colors {RED, GRN, BLU} (used only at the 2-node window S);
(T4) a special plumbing symbol ⊥;
(T5) a bounded collection of error symbols (the error-chain alphabet) as in
§3;
(T6) (for RUN) the working alphabet for a fixed universal TM U running in
BO(1) time.
Thus |Σout| = β = poly(s).
The intended block.
A well-formed block (a regular language over Σout)
has the form
HEADC RID GID RUN PAD,
where:
• HEADC is a self-delimiting binary header that literally stores C on the
in track (copied to output by (T1)) and marks the start of a block.
• RID is a B-bit variable index region; GID is a B-bit clause index region.
• RUN is a row-by-row encoding of a tableau of the fixed machine U which,
given (C, RID, GID), runs for BO(1) steps and computes the three literals
13The radius-1 checking of a 1D flattening of a time poly(B) computation and the
error-chain idea are lifted verbatim from §3 (LBA encoding + locally checkable refutations).
:contentReference[oaicite:2]index=2

of clause(GID) and their signs, and writes three length-B one-hot vectors
V (+), V (−) and V (⊥) on dedicated subtracks:
V (+)[i] = 1 ⇐⇒xi occurs positively in clause(GID),
V (−)[i] = 1 ⇐⇒¬xi occurs,
and V (⊥) is always all zero (reserved for BLU).
• In variable blocks we also run U on (C, RID) to materialize a variable
one-hot vector HotRID ∈{0, 1}B with HotRID[i] = 1 iff i = RID.
The adjacency table Cout–out permits exactly nearest-neighbor pairs con-
sistent with (i) the grammar above (placement of regions, row separators,
phases), and (ii) single-step correctness of U’s transition across each row
seam; malformed pieces are locally refutable by emitting an error-chain (as
in §3), which we also allow in Cout–out and which always leads to a successful
completion.14
The window S and activation.
The two nodes of the window S (in
contexts w1Sw2) may be labeled at f’s discretion by one of the colors
{RED, GRN, BLU} or by ⊥. No other output is allowed at S. The out–out
grammar is arranged so that:
The choice ⊥at S is always extendible. A non-⊥color at S
is extendible only if somewhere inside w1 (resp. w2) there is a
well-formed block whose HEADC matches the fixed header for C,
and whose RID (resp. GID) and tableau are valid.
We say such contexts are active; all other contexts are inactive. Inactive
contexts are thus tautologically satisfied by setting f(·) = ⊥.
Bridge semantics (the ”clause satisfied by variable” test).
For an
active ordered pair (variable on the left, clause on the right), the bridge (F1)
instance waS1wbwcS2wd is allowed to complete iff
∃i ∈[B] with HotRID[i] = 1 and





V (+)[i] = 1
if f(Type(left)) = RED,
V (−)[i] = 1
if f(Type(left)) = GRN,
V (⊥)[i] = 1
if f(Type(left)) = BLU.
14Exactly as in §3: a fixed finite set of error types and local rules allow every malformed
tableau to be disproved by a short, locally checkable chain; on well-formed encodings such
chains cannot be produced. :contentReference[oaicite:3]index=3
9

--- Page 10 ---
This ”∃i” is checked by a standard radius-1 witness chain: upon a color
choice at S1 and S2, the out–out grammar enables a path that (i) guesses
an index i, (ii) walks to bit i inside the left block and requires HotRID[i] = 1,
and (iii) walks to bit i inside the right block and requires the corresponding
V (·)[i] = 1. If any subcheck fails, the chain gets stuck (no completion). This
is exactly the same local ”existential witness” mechanism as in the error-
chain gadget, so it is implementable with radius 1 and a constant alphabet
overhead.15
All other ordered pairs of context types are trivialized: either at least one
side is inactive (then ⊥suffices), or the role pairing is not (variable, clause),
in which case the grammar ignores the colors and accepts with ⊥buffers.
B.4
Existence of exponentially many active context types
Because ℓpump = 2poly(s) and our header+index+run occupy O(s) + O(B) +
BO(1) = poly(s) symbols, by the pumping lemmas there are context types
that (i) have a valid block with any desired RID ∈{0, 1}B on the left and
(ii) context types that have a valid block with any desired GID on the right.
Moreover, types that differ in RID (or in GID) are distinct because, by design,
extendibility from S under a color differs for some bridge depending on the
bit pattern (the witness chain succeeds or not). Hence there are 2B = 2poly(s)
distinct variable types {Vari} and 2B distinct clause types {Clj} present
in C.16
B.5
Correctness of the reduction
We prove (1).
Lemma 2 (Completeness). If ΦC is satisfiable, then there exists f : C →Σ2
out
satisfying (F1) for PC.
Proof. Fix a satisfying assignment α : {x1, . . . , x2B} →{0, 1}. Define f as
follows.
• For each variable type Vari, set f(Vari) = RED if α(xi) = 1 and
f(Vari) = GRN if α(xi) = 0 (either orientation of S may be chosen; the
grammar handles both).
15Witness chains (existential pointers to positions with local checking) are the same
combinatorics as the §3 error pointers; we reuse their radius-1 implementation. :contentRe-
ference[oaicite:4]index=4
16Realization and stability of these patterns inside wb or wc follow from type compo-
sition and replacement; lengths are padded using pumping (§4, Lemmas 11–12, 14–15).
:contentReference[oaicite:5]index=5
10

--- Page 11 ---
• For each clause type Clj, pick any true literal of clause(j) under α and
set f(Clj) to its color: RED for a positive literal, GRN for a negative
literal (use BLU only if desired as a dummy literal, with V (⊥) ≡0 never
satisfying witnesses).
• For all inactive types, set f(τ) = ⊥.
Consider any ordered pair of contexts in the (F1) quantification. If at least
one side is inactive or the roles are not (variable, clause), the bridge is
trivial by construction. If the pair is (Vari, Clj), then by the definition of
the RUN subtracks we have HotRID[i] = 1 inside Vari, and V (+)[i] = 1 (resp.
V (−)[i] = 1) if we chose RED (resp. GRN) at Clj and the picked literal is xi
(resp. ¬xi). Since f(Clj) is a true literal of clause(j), such a choice exists,
and the bridge DP succeeds via a witness chain at index i. Hence every (F1)
check passes.
Lemma 3 (Soundness). If there exists f satisfying (F1) for PC, then ΦC is
satisfiable.
Proof. From f, read an assignment α by
α(xi) =





1,
f(Vari) = RED,
0,
f(Vari) = GRN,
arbitrary,
f(Vari) = BLU (we may fix it to 0),
for all variable types Vari (if f(Vari) = ⊥, the type is inactive, impossible
by construction of Vari). Fix any clause index j. If f(Clj) = ⊥then Clj is
inactive, which contradicts the existence of the header+RUN in Clj; hence
f(Clj) ∈{RED, GRN, BLU}.
Consider the (F1) bridge for the ordered
pair (Vari, Clj) where i ranges over all variables that appear in clause(j).
The out–out grammar allows completion only if there exists an index i
with HotRID[i] = 1 in Vari and the corresponding V (+)[i] = 1 (for RED)
or V (−)[i] = 1 (for GRN) in Clj. Because (F1) must hold for every such
ordered pair, the choice f(Clj) must be compatible with at least one Vari
that actually occurs in clause(j); therefore the picked color is a true literal
under α. Since j was arbitrary, every clause has a true literal: α satisfies
ΦC.
Lemma 4 (Inactive contexts never constrain f). If a context lacks a well-
formed header+indices+valid RUN (on either side), then any output at S
except ⊥makes the (F1) bridge DP fail, while ⊥always extends. Thus such
contexts are irrelevant and do not affect the existence of f.
11

--- Page 12 ---
Proof. Both statements follow from the grammar: non-⊥at S activates
witness chains that must eventually check bits inside a block; in the absence
of a valid block the chain gets stuck and no completion exists. Conversely,
when S is ⊥, the out–out table contains a self-looping ⊥buffer language that
trivially completes the bridge (the same plumbing as in the upper-bound
DP). The error-chain rules guarantee that malformed fragments admit locally
checkable refutations and hence do not impose constraints.17
Theorem 3 (FFE(F1) is NEXPTIME-complete). For β-normalized, radius-
1 LCLs on globally oriented paths (explicit model), Feasible-Function
Existence is NEXPTIME-complete.
Proof. Membership is Theorem 2. For hardness, the reduction C 7→PC runs
in poly(s) time and produces |Σout| = β = poly(s) with adjacency tables of
size Θ(β2). By Lemmas 2–4, (1) holds. Hence FFE(F1) is NEXPTIME-
hard.
B.6
From (F1) to the full feasible-function (F1)+(F2)
To pass from mid-consistency to the full feasible-function existence (bridging
included), add a neutral symbol ⊥(already present) and allow, in Cout–out,
arbitrary ⊥-labelings on repetitions wz
1 and wz
2. Then (F2) is vacuous: for
every context (w1, S, w2) and every z ≥1, the partial labeling that fixes S
to f(Type(w1Sw2)) extends by filling wz
i with ⊥. Hence:
Corollary 1 (Classification hardness). Deciding the distributed class (O(1)
vs. O(log∗n) vs. Θ(n)) via feasible functions is NEXPTIME-hard in the
explicit β-normalized, radius-1 model.
B.7
Size and radius bookkeeping
All rules are radius 1. The only growth parameter is β = poly(s), which
controls the number of output symbols needed for (i) the fixed role/phase
tracks, (ii) the three color tokens {RED, GRN, BLU} and ⊥, (iii) the fi-
nite error alphabet, and (iv) the universal machine U work alphabet. The
header+indices+RUN occupy O(s) + O(B) + BO(1) = poly(s) positions,
17See §3 for the error-chain ”disprover” gadget accepted by the verifier, ensuring mal-
formed encodings always have completions, and §4 for the ”plumbing” view of the DP.

whereas the pump length satisfies ℓpump = 2Θ(β4) = 2poly(s), which guaran-
tees that active contexts containing such blocks exist and are stable under
replacement/pumping.18
18All quantitative bounds (type count, replacement, pumping) follow from §4; the
error alphabet and local checking of bounded-time executions are from §3. :contentRefer-

Overall: strong convergence on the key fixes (forbid ⊥ at S on active seams; occurrence-only clause palette; sign bound to RUN; exclusivity of Eq/Neq). The remaining work is to make these radius-1 and type-local with explicit tiles and to remove a couple of inconsistencies. The hybrid direction (P02’s seam/handshake plus P01’s nearest-block barriers) is the most robust.

| Claim (short) | Status [OK/Unclear/Broken] | Why |
| Forbid ⊥ at S on active seams | Unclear | All three outline local handshakes (Offer/NoOffer or activation codes), but no explicit seam tables are given; P01 also mixes S palettes across sides. Need exact Cout–out matrices and side-specific S palettes. |
| Eq/Neq exclusivity | OK | Each prover gives a radius-1 scheme (eq_so_far or per-bit tiles) where Eq succeeds iff RID=ip and Neq iff RID≠ip, with mutual exclusion via gating. Missing only the pointer-integrity tiles. |
| F2 via nearest-block barriers | Unclear | P01’s “barrier” story is plausible but uninstantiated; P03’s “RepeatPAD-in-repeats-only” risks leaking into bridges unless tied to local barrier tokens. Need explicit barrier tokens and a proof cursors cannot cross. |

Per-prover audit and minimal fixes/counterexamples:
- Prover 01: The activation via input code 10/01 is fine in spirit, but two issues: (i) S palette inconsistency: you use ΣS={⊥,O1,O2,O3} yet later require the “left S color” to be VT/VF. Fix by splitting S into two nodes/palettes: S1∈{VT,VF,⊥} on the variable side and S2∈{O1,O2,O3,⊥} on the clause side (as in P02/P03). (ii) Radius-1 gating that depends on pred(uL).in needs a locally available witness for that input bit. Without a rule that replicates predecessor input onto uL (or a local input-output constraint that can read neighbor’s input), your Cin–out gate cannot enforce the 10/01 codes. Minimal lemma: add a one-step input-forwarding track that copies each node’s input bit to its right neighbor’s output; then uL can see both bits with r=1. Your F2/barrier story is promising; please list the exact barrier tokens and show witness cursors cannot cross them.
- Prover 02: The Offer/NoOffer seam grammar and occurrence-only S2 palette cleanly forbid ⊥ at active seams and force CertStart. The Eq/Neq witness with pointer integrity is standard; just instantiate the tiles tying HotRID↔RIDbits and Selected(ip)↔RUN. Two cautions: (i) Avoid the “tester clause j*” unless you can prove it stays neutral in F1; an active j* will add constraints across all Var_i and can break completeness. Prefer to derive type separation from clauses produced by C (or via internal boundary-extendibility masks that do not introduce new active types). (ii) Your question about hardness: yes, mapping SAT(C) to a dichotomy {Θ(log* n), Θ(n)} is sufficient to prove NEXPTIME-hardness of the three-way classifier (it must still choose among three labels).
- Prover 03: Your eq_so_far register and mismatch token formalize exclusivity nicely. The RepeatPAD idea is risky: unless RepeatPAD is tied to barrier symbols that are guaranteed to be present strictly beyond the nearest blocks, it can accidentally appear in bridges and trivialize F1. Prefer P01’s barrier-only approach: nearest blocks interact with S; all others are separated by a locally-detectable barrier that blocks cursors. Also, the tester j* has the same neutrality pitfall as above. Occurrence-only palette {O1,O2,O3} with sign read from RUN is indeed preferred.

Next most valuable artifacts to raise confidence: (1) explicit seam tables (offers, ⊥-forbiddance, CertStart, CAP/PAD gating); (2) the bit-comparator and pointer-integrity tiles; (3) barrier tokens and a 1–2 step proof that cursors die at barriers; (4) a B=2 worked DP trace showing one ON (CAP) and one OFF (PAD) case; (5) a short formal for F2: adding copies of w to the left/right does not change boundary extendibility because only nearest blocks expose Offer and accept CertStart.

Verifier notes (2025-08-27):
- Adopt a hybrid: use Prover 02’s gate to separate ON (i∈vars(j)) from OFF pairs, and Prover 01’s window-anchored blocks to keep all semantics within wb/wc.
- Replace any O(1)-time checker with a poly(s)-length, radius-1 tableau inside wc (and wb as needed) that verifies C(j) and exposes the needed bits to the gate; ensure error-chain refutations for malformed headers.
- Do not rely on boundary-only signatures for type multiplicity; instead, separate types by differential boundary-extendibility induced by interior content (witness success/failure under fixed S-labels).
- Action items: (i) write explicit boundary tables (offers, gate, PAD/CAP conduits), (ii) specify the clause-verification tableau and its alphabet, (iii) prove type-separation and OFF/ON correctness, (iv) complete a B=2 worked example with DP simulation.
Verifier notes addendum (2025-08-27):
- Critical: Forbid ⊥ at S on active contexts. Adjust Cout–out so that when the window anchors a well-formed variable/clause block, the S palette excludes ⊥ and forces an offer; only inactive contexts allow ⊥. This preserves nontriviality of (F1).
- Adopt Prover 01’s occurrence-only S palette {O1,O2,O3}; read the sign from the verified RUN. If using sign-coded S tokens, add a local rule that forces the S-sign to equal the RUN’s sign for the selected occurrence.
- Gate exclusivity: Write and prove a radius-1 lemma that exactly one of equality/inequality certificates is realizable, with CAP allowed only under equality and PAD only under inequality.
- Type separation: Prefer a neutral tester j* (present as a type but labelable so it imposes no constraints under f) to guarantee distinct Var_i without relying on properties of C. Validate no side effects on (F1) or (F2).
- Proceed with explicit seam tables (offers, gate, CAP/PAD), the clause RUN tiles and error chains, and the B=2 worked DP table.
Verifier notes (addendum 2025-08-27, PM):
- Adopt two S-side palettes: S1 (variable side) ∈ {VT,VF,⊥}, S2 (clause side) ∈ {O1,O2,O3,⊥}. Forbid ⊥ at S1/S2 when the adjacent neighbor emits Offer; allow ⊥ only when the neighbor is Neutral/NoOffer.
- Prefer P02’s Offer/NoOffer seam grammar (CertStart, CAP/PAD conduits) and P01’s nearest-block barrier to make F2 automatic without trivializing F1. Barriers must stop all witness/cursor tokens and be placed exactly one node past RUN footers.
- Eq/Neq exclusivity: implement eq_so_far or per-bit comparator tiles with pointer-integrity tying HotRID↔RIDbits and Selected(ip)↔RUN. CAP only after full Eq; PAD only after Neq mismatch.
- Do not introduce a tester clause j* unless neutrality in F1 is proven. Aim to separate types via clauses from C or via internal extendibility masks.
- Activation-by-input (if used) must be radius-1: forward predecessor input locally or avoid using it.
- Action: write explicit seam tables; list barrier tokens/tiles; provide a B=2 DP walk for one ON and one OFF pair.
