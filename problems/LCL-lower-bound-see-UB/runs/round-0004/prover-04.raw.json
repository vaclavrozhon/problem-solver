We now pin down explicit, radius-1 Cout–out rule schemas for (i) per-bit boundary probes that separate 2^B vertex indices; (ii) per-side color gating and seam activation with correct mixed-pair behavior; (iii) a seam verdict interface enforcing simultaneously EDGE=1 ⇒ color-inequality and Eq=1 ⇒ color-equality, while keeping error-escape disabled in active modes. We also provide a B=2 (toy) instance blueprint and a symbol budget check.\\n\\nCorrections/clarifications to output.md (gaps)\\n- Types with fixed interior inputs: Please add to Definitions: “If the model fixes interior inputs, E_w(a) is computed with respect to those fixed inputs.” Our reduction relies on Cin–out copying input bits to outputs in PORT cells; extendibility is type-invariant under the fixed interior input string.\\n- Context set size: It helps to note explicitly that context types are a subset of the global type space realized by words w_1 S w_2 with |w_i| ∈ {ℓ_pump, ℓ_pump+1}, hence |C| ≤ ℓ_pump.\\n\\nSymbols/tracks used (Σ_out components folded into symbols)\\n- Colors at the two S nodes: Scol ∈ {RED, GRN, BLU, ⊥}.\\n- Roles/phases (constant): {HEAD, PORT, RUN, PAD, ERR, GATE_L, GATE_R, BRIDGE, VERD} × {phase ∈ [c]}.\\n- Port subtracks at Role=PORT: Addr ∈ [B] (unary, i.e., distinct symbol per j) and RIDbit ∈ {0,1} with Cin–out tie RIDbit = input bit.\\n- Probe states (left side) per j ∈ [B]: Start_j, Head_j, Test_j, Accept_j.\\n- Reserved boundary outputs per j ∈ [B]: 4-tuples Q_j ≡ (Q^L1_j, Q^L2_j, Q^R2_j, Q^R1_j) used only on the four boundary nodes.\\n- Seam verdict neighbor (right of S2): VERD(FwdColor ∈ {R,G,B}, EDGE ∈ {0,1}, Eq ∈ {0,1}). We also use a one-cell “forwarder” just left of S2 inside the RUN corridor to carry FwdColor.\\n- Error/plumbing: a constant ERR alphabet (as in the PSPACE ref.) and PAD; these are disabled in active probe/seam modes (see discipline below).\\n\\nA. Per-bit probe gadget (Type-Separation, radius-1)\\nParameters: B = s^{c0}, β = s^{c1}, c1 ≥ c0 so β ≥ c·B for a fixed constant c.\\n\\nLayout of a canonical left vertex block W_L(u)\\n- Immediately to the right of S, a contiguous PORT zone of length B: the j-th cell carries Role=PORT, Addr=j, and RIDbit = u_j, with Cin–out enforcing RIDbit equals the input bit at that node. Outside PORT, a short HEAD and long PAD. Right of S this is the only active structure; elsewhere PAD (neutral).\\n\\nProbe discipline (no error-escape / unique continuation)\\n- Under the boundary outputs Q_j on the left boundary (and a fixed boundary-input 4-tuple a⋆), we force a deterministic “probe mode” corridor from the boundary into the interior. While any Probe state appears on an edge, no Cout–out pair involving ERR or ⊥ is listed; the only legal successors are those below. Outside reserved probes, error/⊥-plumbing is available as usual.\\n\\nRadius-1 Cout–out rule schema (parametrized by j)\\n- Boundary injection: allow (Q^L2_j → Start_j) on the left-boundary-to-interior edge; forbid any other successor from Q^L2_j.\\n- Movement: for any interior x, allow (Start_j → Head_j) on the next edge; for any non-PORT cell y (Role∈{HEAD,RUN,PAD}), allow (Head_j at predecessor → Head_j at y). Disallow any (Head_j → ERR/*) or (* → Start_j) except the specified ones.\\n- Port scan: at a PORT cell with Addr=k ≠ j, allow (Head_j(prev) → Head_j(curr)), continuing the march. At a PORT cell with Addr=j and RIDbit=b, allow exactly one of:\\n  • If b=1: (Head_j(prev) → Test_j(curr)) and (Test_j(curr) → Accept_j(next)), where Accept_j transitions (deterministically in O(1) steps) to PAD.\\n  • If b=0: (Head_j(prev) → [no successor]); i.e., no pair listed; the DP dies.\\n- Addr enforcement: between consecutive PORT cells, only pairs that increment Addr by 1 are allowed (e.g., (PORT@Addr=k, PORT@Addr=k+1)); Addr monotonicity before reaching the PORT zone is enforced by disallowing (Head_j → PORT@Addr≠1) at the very first PORT and by requiring contiguous PORT cells.\\n\\nClaim TS (Type-Separation; precise)\\nFor any canonical W_L(u) and fixed boundary inputs a⋆, we have E_{W_L(u)}(a⋆)[Q_j] = u_j. Proof sketch: Under Q_j, the only legal continuation is the above deterministic probe; it reaches the unique PORT cell with Addr=j, where continuation exists iff RIDbit=1. Cin–out ties RIDbit to the input bit, so acceptance depends only on u_j. No error/⊥ escape is possible in probe mode. Hence the B-bit vector (E(a⋆)[Q_1],…,E(a⋆)[Q_B]) equals u; distinct u give distinct vectors, i.e., distinct left types. Symmetrically, we obtain 2^B right types with a mirrored probe.\\n\\nAlphabet budget for probes\\n- PORT symbols: 2·B (RIDbit×Addr) distinct symbols.\\n- Probes: 4·B symbols (Start_j,Head_j,Test_j,Accept_j) across j.\\n- Reserved boundary symbols: ≤4·B tokens for the four boundary positions (Q^L1_j,…), re-used across instances.\\n- Add O(1) roles/phases, PAD, ERR, RUN alphabet: total |Σ_out| = O(B) + O(1) = Θ(B) ≤ β.\\n\\nB. Per-side color gating and mixed pairs\\nPer-side handshake\\n- The cell immediately adjacent to S1 on the left interior uses role GATE_L if and only if a well-formed canonical left vertex block is present; otherwise that cell uses PAD/HEAD/RUN. Similarly, on the right interior adjacent to S2 we use role GATE_R iff a canonical right block is present. These are enforced by local HEAD/PORT placement and phases.\\n- The allowed Cout–out pairs between a GATE_* cell and its adjacent S node restrict the S symbol’s handshake flags: the S symbol includes two read-only bits HL, HR. At S1, adjacency with GATE_L forces HL=1 (else no pair allowed); if not GATE_L, adjacency forces HL=0. Similarly, at S2, adjacency with GATE_R forces HR=1 else HR=0. These flags are forced by neighbors; f cannot change them.\\nColor permission\\n- Pairs between a GATE_* cell and S permit Scol ∈ {RED,GRN,BLU,⊥}. When not GATE_* (i.e., PAD/HEAD), only Scol=⊥ is permitted. Thus colors are permitted per-side based on the adjacent interior only; this is independent across sides.\\nMixed pairs accept unconditionally\\n- If exactly one side is canonical (say HL=1, HR=0), we do not activate the seam tableau. The S1–S2 pair allows any (Scol1 ∈ {R,G,B}, Scol2=⊥) combination; the two interior halves are filled with PAD/⊥ plumbing. No must-color constraint is enforced here.\\n\\nC. Seam activation and verdict wiring (active-active pairs)\\nActivation and must-color locality\\n- The seam is active only when both sides are canonical; locally this is encoded by HL=1 at S1 and HR=1 at S2 (both forced by the adjacent GATE_* cells). Only in this case do we enforce “must-color”: the S1–S2 adjacency forbids any pair with Scol1=⊥ or Scol2=⊥ when (HL=1 and HR=1). When either HL=0 or HR=0, ⊥ is allowed on the corresponding S and the seam is inactive.\\nRUN_B tableau and verdict cell\\n- Across wb∘wc (a corridor spanning into both sides right next to S), Cout–out enforces a row-by-row simulation of a fixed TM U on input (enc(D), u, v). The RUN corridor is enabled only when HL=HR=1 and both S nodes are non-⊥. The last row writes into the neighbor immediately to the right of S2 a symbol VERD(FwdColor, EDGE, Eq), where FwdColor∈{R,G,B} is a copy of Scol1, EDGE = D(u,v), and Eq = [u=v]. ERR is disallowed adjacent to RUN/VERD in this active mode (no escape).\\nLocal verdict check (pure radius-1)\\n- Pairs S2 ↔ VERD are allowed exactly when both constraints hold:\\n  (A) if EDGE=1 then FwdColor ≠ Scol2; if EDGE=0 then no restriction.\\n  (B) if Eq=1 then FwdColor = Scol2; if Eq=0 then no restriction.\\n- The edge S1 ↔ S2 additionally forbids ⊥ when HL=HR=1 (must-color) and otherwise imposes no restriction. No other global signal is used.\\nCorrectness: On active-active pairs, acceptance iff (EDGE=0 or colors differ) and (Eq=0 or colors equal). This enforces 3-coloring on edges and consistency on (u,u) pairs.\\n\\nD. Soundness/completeness (recap) and role of mixed pairs\\n- Completeness: Given a proper 3-coloring χ of the succinct graph, define f on canonical types by f(τ^L_u)=χ(u), f(τ^R_v)=χ(v), all other types map to ⊥. On active-active pairs (u,v): RUN_B computes (EDGE,Eq); (A)(B) hold by χ. On mixed pairs: seam inactive; pairs accept with plumbing. Hence (F1) holds. (F2) is neutralized by ⊥-filling (see F below).\\n- Soundness: If f passes (F1), then each canonical τ^L_u must be colored (or some active-active seam would violate must-color), and the values on τ^L_u and τ^R_u must coincide (pair (u,u) has Eq=1). For any edge (u,v) with D(u,v)=1, the pair (τ^L_u, τ^R_v) must satisfy (A), forcing χ(u)≠χ(v). Thus χ is a proper 3-coloring.\\n\\nE. B=2 DP-checkable skeleton (auditable)\\nSymbols (sample)\\n- Colors at S: S_R, S_G, S_B, S_⊥ (each encodes HL,HR bits as forced by neighbors).\\n- PORT cells: P1^0,P1^1 and P2^0,P2^1 (Addr=1 or 2 and RIDbit=b). Cin–out allows Pj^b only on input b.\\n- Probes: Start_1,Head_1,Test_1,Accept_1 and Start_2,Head_2,Test_2,Accept_2.\\n- Boundary: Q^L1_1,Q^L2_1 (and similarly for j=2), mirrored on the right.\\n- Gating: GATE_L, GATE_R on the interior cells adjacent to S, else PAD.\\n- Verdict: VERD(c∈{R,G,B}, EDGE∈{0,1}, Eq∈{0,1}).\\nKey Cout–out pairs (non-exhaustive but complete by schema)\\n- Probe injection and march: (Q^L2_j → Start_j), (Start_j → Head_j), (Head_j → Head_j) on non-PORT, (Head_j → Head_j) on PORT@Addr≠j, (Head_j → Test_j) on PORT@Addr=j, then (Test_j → Accept_j) iff RIDbit=1, then Accept_j → PAD.\\n- PORT adjacency: (P1^b → P2^{b′}) allowed; (Addr monotonicity) require that between consecutive PORT cells, Addr increases by 1 (here 1→2). No other PORT transitions.\\n- Per-side color gating: (GATE_L → S_x with HL=1) and (non-GATE_L → S_⊥ with HL=0) only; symmetrically for S2 and HR.\\n- Seam activation/must-color: edge (S1 ↔ S2) forbids S_⊥ on either side when HL=HR=1; allows any pair otherwise.\\n- Verdict check: (S2=R ↔ VERD(FwdColor=R,EDGE=1,Eq=0)) is forbidden; (S2=R ↔ VERD(FwdColor=G,EDGE=1,Eq=0)) allowed; similarly for other colors; and (Eq=1) forces equality by allowing only pairs with FwdColor=Scol2; when EDGE=0 both equal/unequal are allowed. No VERD neighbors occur unless HL=HR=1 (RUN active); otherwise the neighbor is PAD.\\nAudit plan\\n- Verify TS: run the O(kβ^2) DP on L(00),L(01),L(10),L(11) under Q_1,Q_2 with the above probe rules; acceptance matches u_j.\\n- Verify seam: choose a small D (e.g., 4-cycle) and implement U as a constant table that writes EDGE,Eq deterministically from u,v (for B=2, D can be tabulated directly). Check that all active-active pairs accept iff inequality on edges and equality when u=v. Mixed pairs accept regardless.\\n\\nF. Neutralizing (F2)\\nAdd to Cout–out a neutral self-looping ⊥-language: for any repetition w^z, z≥1, and any boundary outputs/inputs, the interiors can be labeled entirely with PAD/⊥ without touching S or the handshake flags. Then for every context (w1,S,w2) and any z≥1, f(Type(w1Sw2)) on S extends trivially: (F2) holds for all f.\\n\\nG. Existence of canonical contexts at lengths ℓ_pump/ℓ_pump+1\\nWe rely on the standard replacement/pumping lemmas for path types (ref. Lemmas 10–15, 11, 12 in the attached paper): HEAD+PORT+RUN have length poly(s) ≪ ℓ_pump = 2^{Θ(β^4)}. We place W_L(u) and W_R(v) adjacent to S and pad only outside the PORT zone to achieve total side lengths in {ℓ_pump,ℓ_pump+1}. Replacement preserves type near S, so each u (and v) has at least one canonical left (right) context in C. This item should be added explicitly to output.md or cited as such; until then, treat it as an assumption backed by the cited lemmas.\\n\\nH. Determinism and locality checks (addressing reviewer points)\\n- Probe determinism: In probe mode (presence of Start_j/Head_j/Test_j), Cout–out lists no ERR/⊥ pairs; only the deterministic march/test/accept transitions exist. Thus E(a⋆)[Q_j] is a single-bit function of RIDbit[j].\\n- Seam wiring locality: The final check uses only the pair S2 ↔ VERD; the must-color trigger uses only S1 ↔ S2 with locally stored HL,HR flags.\\n- S symbol control by f: The only component of S chosen by f is the color field; HL,HR are forced by neighbors via adjacency constraints.\\n- Budget: Σ_out has O(B) reserved symbols and O(1) others; choose β ≥ c·B. Tables Cin–out (2×β) and Cout–out (β×β) remain poly(β).\\n\\nI. Why this is incremental progress\\n- We have converted the earlier sketches into explicit, radius-1 rule schemas that the verifier can instantiate for B=2 and check with the O(kβ^2) DP. We addressed mixed pairs (seam inactive; unconditional acceptance), must-color locality (only when both handshakes present), S-symbol control (only color is free), probe-mode determinism (no error-escape), and seam wiring locality. We provided a concrete symbol budget and a B=2 audit plan.\\n\\nNext steps (auditable deliverables)\\n1) Write the parameterized Cout–out tables for probes explicitly (as a list of allowed pairs for Start_j,Head_j,Test_j,Accept_j, PORT adjacency), and the Cin–out mask tying PORT.RIDbit to Σ_in.\\n2) Enumerate the S-adjacent pairs that gate colors per side, enforce must-color only when HL=HR=1, and list the S2↔VERD pairs that implement (A)(B).\\n3) For B=2, produce a machine-readable instance (Σ_out symbol list, Cin–out, Cout–out) and run the DP to validate TS and seam behavior on all 16 ordered pairs (L(u),R(v)).\\n4) Incorporate (or cite) the pumping/replacement lemmas into output.md to justify existence of canonical contexts at the required lengths. If preferred, give an explicit padding construction that never touches the PORT zone.\\n5) Package the reduction D ↦ P_D, state the equivalence “G 3-colorable ⇔ (F1) feasible f,” and add the ⊥-filler to neutralize (F2), yielding the NEXPTIME-hardness of the 3-way classifier under the explicit β-normalized, r=1 model.\\n\"}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"auto","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"ProverOutput","schema_":{"properties":{"progress_md":{"description":"Append-only progress notes","title":"Progress Md","type":"string"}},"required":["progress_md"],"title":"ProverOutput","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":68417,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":9238,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":5120},"total_tokens":77655},"user":null,"store":true}
