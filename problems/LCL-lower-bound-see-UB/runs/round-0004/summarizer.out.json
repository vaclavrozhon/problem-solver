  "summary_md": "This round constructs a radius-1, type-local seam gadget split into two S-nodes (S1 on the variable side, S2 on the clause side) with explicit out\u2013out edge tables at the left, central and right seams. The tables (i) forbid \u22a5 at active seams, (ii) allow EqStart/NeqStart only when both sides offer, and (iii) enforce mutual exclusion and sign-gating of CAP/PAD. Equality/inequality certificates are implemented with pointer-integrity: RIDbits + HotRID on the variable side, Selected + ip_bits + sign on the clause side, and per-bit cursor tokens (EqL/EqR, NeqPick/NeqCheck). A radius-1 exclusivity lemma (E\u2019) shows exactly one terminal (CAP or PAD) can succeed per active pair; any spoofing triggers an error-chain that removes Offer. Nearest-block barrier tokens placed one node past RUN footers kill cursors and force seam-neutrality beyond the nearest blocks, making (F2) independent of repetitions. A worked B=2 DP trace (ON vs OFF) is given. Pending: explicit out\u2013out tile lists and a small symbol-count check. Source: prover-01.out.json (progress_md).",

    "Radius-1, type-local seam split into S1 (VT/VF/\u22a5/start/CAP/PAD) and S2 (O1/O2/O3/\u22a5/start/CAP/PAD) with explicit left/central/right seam edge tables enforcing offer/no-offer and central mutual exclusion.",
    "Equality/inequality certificates use RIDbits + HotRID (variable) and ip_bits + Selected + sgn (clause) with unary-addressed cursor tokens (EqL/EqR, NeqPick, NeqCheck); pointer integrity prevents spoofing.",
    "Exclusivity lemma E\u2019: for any active (AccVar,AccCla) pair and chosen Op, exactly one of Eq (CAP) or Neq (PAD) can reach its terminal; mismatches trigger an error-chain that kills Offer.",
    "CAP emission is sign-gated: (CAP,CAP) allowed only when S1\u2019s idle truth matches sgn[p] copied from RUN, preventing sign-cheats.",
    "Nearest-block barriers (BarVar/BarCla) placed immediately after block footers forbid cursor tokens and force seam-neutrality, removing dependence on repetition count z and closing the \u22a5-trivialization gap.",
    "Worked B=2 trace: concrete RID=10 and clause occurrences show ON case produces (CAP,CAP) and OFF produces (PAD,PAD); outer seams reject \u22a5 on active interfaces."

  "next_questions": [
    "Provide the explicit small set of out\u2013out tile pairs that tie HotRID\u2194RIDbits and Selected\u2194RUN, plus the error-chain tiles that deactivate malformed blocks, and produce a concrete symbol count \u03b2 = poly(s).",
    "Tabulate the full central-seam per-bit tile table for B=2 (b=0,1,2) and give the short radius-1 proofs that (i) EqStart/NeqStart cannot appear unless both outer seams are active and (ii) barriers block any cursor propagation in \u22641 step.",
    "Confirm locally that malformed blocks cannot emit Footer\u2192Barrier (i.e., that the block grammar and tiles force malformed blocks into the error-chain and thus Neutral/NoOffer)."
