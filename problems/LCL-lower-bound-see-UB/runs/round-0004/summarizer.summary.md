This round constructs a radius-1, type-local seam gadget split into two S-nodes (S1 on the variable side, S2 on the clause side) with explicit out–out edge tables at the left, central and right seams. The tables (i) forbid ⊥ at active seams, (ii) allow EqStart/NeqStart only when both sides offer, and (iii) enforce mutual exclusion and sign-gating of CAP/PAD. Equality/inequality certificates are implemented with pointer-integrity: RIDbits + HotRID on the variable side, Selected + ip_bits + sign on the clause side, and per-bit cursor tokens (EqL/EqR, NeqPick/NeqCheck). A radius-1 exclusivity lemma (E’) shows exactly one terminal (CAP or PAD) can succeed per active pair; any spoofing triggers an error-chain that removes Offer. Nearest-block barrier tokens placed one node past RUN footers kill cursors and force seam-neutrality beyond the nearest blocks, making (F2) independent of repetitions. A worked B=2 DP trace (ON vs OFF) is given. Pending: explicit out–out tile lists and a small symbol-count check. Source: prover-01.out.json (progress_md).
