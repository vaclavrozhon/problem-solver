Round 0004 (prover-04) converts the earlier sketches into explicit, radius-1 local-rule schemas that a DP verifier can check. Main deliverables: (i) a deterministic per-bit boundary probe (reserved boundary 4-tuples Q_j) with no ERR/⊥ escape and the Type-Separation claim E_{W_L(u)}(a⋆)[Q_j]=u_j, so 2^B left/right types; (ii) per-side GateL/GateR gating that permits colors at S only for canonical sides, ensures mixed pairs accept via neutral PAD plumbing, and enforces must-color only when both sides are canonical; (iii) a seam RUN_B tableau that writes VERD(FwdColor,EDGE,Eq) adjacent to S2 and enforces EDGE/Eq constraints purely by the S2↔VERD radius-1 pair; (iv) an explicit alphabet budget (|Σ_out| = Θ(B), choose β ≥ c·B) and a concrete B=2 skeleton plus DP audit plan. The construction neutralizes F2 by ⊥-plumbing and notes reliance on pumping/replacement lemmas to guarantee canonical contexts at lengths ℓ_pump/ℓ_pump+1. Cited file: prover-04.out.json (progress_md).
