Overall assessment: The four reports converge on the same three core gadgets (per-bit boundary probes, per-side color gating, and a seam tableau with a local verdict). The proposals are substantially clearer than prior rounds and move us toward a DP-auditable rule set. The most robust and fully local seam activation appears in Prover 02 via directional tokens; Provers 01 and 04 describe activation via “ActiveBridgeStart” or HL/HR flags but do not completely resolve the simultaneity/locality constraints without an explicit cross-seam mechanism. Prover 03’s statements are well-packaged as lemmas but understate the alphabet budget in places; the “O(B)” total budget is plausible only with strictly disjoint-role subalphabets (no unintended cross products), which should be stated and enforced.

Correctness/rigor audit:
- Per-bit probe (all provers): The deterministic pipeline (Start_j → Move/Head_j → Test_j → Accept_j) with ERR/⊥ disabled near probe states is solid and DP-checkable. Key to verify: (i) the PORT zone is contiguous and abuts S; (ii) Addr increments strictly; (iii) the only successor at Addr=j depends on RIDbit; (iv) no alternative successors from probe states. These are all expressible as radius-1 adjacency constraints. Budgeting O(B)–O(B^2) symbols/edges is fine under β = poly(s).
- Seam activation and mixed pairs: Prover 02’s directional tokens Tok→/Tok← give purely local conditions for (a) must-color only in active-active pairs and (b) unconditional acceptance for mixed pairs. Provers 01/04’s “simultaneous” activation requires either extra bits on S that depend on both neighbors or a cross-seam handshake; as stated, they leave a locality gap (a canonical side could spuriously enable its own ActiveBridgeStart without seeing the opposite side). Prefer 02’s token design.
- Verdict cell and constraints: The S2–V local adjacency enforcing both EDGE=1 ⇒ colors differ and Eq=1 ⇒ colors equal is coherent; the diagonal issue (EDGE∧Eq) is avoided by setting D(u,u)=0. Also ensure that in active-active mode ERR/⊥ are disabled adjacent to RUN/VERD to prevent escape.
- Alphabet budget: 01/04 explicitly use disjoint subalphabets per role so sizes add, not multiply; with this, O(B)–O(B^2) symbols is credible. 02 offers an O(B^3) worst-case fallback if we fully decouple tracks; pick β = s^{c1} with c1 ≥ 2c0 (or 3c0 for extra slack) and stick to disjoint-role alphabets to keep |Σ_out| = Θ(B)–O(B^2).
- Length normalization: All rely on pumping/replacement to guarantee canonical contexts at lengths ℓ_pump or ℓ_pump+1; this remains an assumption to be proven (or replaced by an explicit padding argument). Do not add it to output.md yet.

Value/triage:
- Genuine progress: explicit, radius-1 rule schemas for the probe and seam verdict; a local, token-based seam activation resolving mixed pairs (from 02); concrete B=2 test plan; reasonable alphabet and adjacency budgeting.
- Outstanding: fully enumerated Cin–out and Cout–out tables (at least parametrically); explicit DP harness and B=2 instance; a rigorous length-normalization lemma.

Promising direction and next steps:
1) Adopt Prover 02’s directional-token seam activation. Specify the exact S-adjacent and interior-adjacent Cout–out pairs that: (i) propagate tokens deterministically; (ii) forbid ⊥ and neutral neighbors at S only when the opposite-direction token is present; (iii) forbid ERR near RUN/VERD in active mode; and (iv) allow neutral fallback in mixed pairs.
2) For probes, enumerate the allowed pairs for Start_j/Head_j/Test_j/Accept_j and PORT adjacency (Addr monotonicity) and list explicitly the omissions (no ERR/⊥ near probe states, no alternative successors).
3) Produce a B=2 machine-readable instance (symbol list, Cin–out, Cout–out) and run the O(kβ^2) DP to verify: (a) E_{L(u)}(a⋆)[Q_1,Q_2] = (u_1,u_2); (b) mixed-pair acceptance regardless of the color on the canonical side; (c) active-active acceptance behavior for a toy D (e.g., 4-cycle) including the Eq constraint.
4) After B=2 validation, generalize the parametric tables for arbitrary B and give a short, self-contained padding lemma (r=1) to ensure canonical contexts exist at required lengths.
5) Only then, promote Lemma TS (type separation), Lemma RG (per-side gating + must-color), and Lemma SG (seam tableau with local verdict) into output.md.
