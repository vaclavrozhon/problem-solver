  "feedback_md": "Overall assessment: The four reports converge on the same three core gadgets (per-bit boundary probes, per-side color gating, and a seam tableau with a local verdict). The proposals are substantially clearer than prior rounds and move us toward a DP-auditable rule set. The most robust and fully local seam activation appears in Prover 02 via directional tokens; Provers 01 and 04 describe activation via \u201cActiveBridgeStart\u201d or HL/HR flags but do not completely resolve the simultaneity/locality constraints without an explicit cross-seam mechanism. Prover 03\u2019s statements are well-packaged as lemmas but understate the alphabet budget in places; the \u201cO(B)\u201d total budget is plausible only with strictly disjoint-role subalphabets (no unintended cross products), which should be stated and enforced.\n\nCorrectness/rigor audit:\n- Per-bit probe (all provers): The deterministic pipeline (Start_j \u2192 Move/Head_j \u2192 Test_j \u2192 Accept_j) with ERR/\u22a5 disabled near probe states is solid and DP-checkable. Key to verify: (i) the PORT zone is contiguous and abuts S; (ii) Addr increments strictly; (iii) the only successor at Addr=j depends on RIDbit; (iv) no alternative successors from probe states. These are all expressible as radius-1 adjacency constraints. Budgeting O(B)\u2013O(B^2) symbols/edges is fine under \u03b2 = poly(s).\n- Seam activation and mixed pairs: Prover 02\u2019s directional tokens Tok\u2192/Tok\u2190 give purely local conditions for (a) must-color only in active-active pairs and (b) unconditional acceptance for mixed pairs. Provers 01/04\u2019s \u201csimultaneous\u201d activation requires either extra bits on S that depend on both neighbors or a cross-seam handshake; as stated, they leave a locality gap (a canonical side could spuriously enable its own ActiveBridgeStart without seeing the opposite side). Prefer 02\u2019s token design.\n- Verdict cell and constraints: The S2\u2013V local adjacency enforcing both EDGE=1 \u21d2 colors differ and Eq=1 \u21d2 colors equal is coherent; the diagonal issue (EDGE\u2227Eq) is avoided by setting D(u,u)=0. Also ensure that in active-active mode ERR/\u22a5 are disabled adjacent to RUN/VERD to prevent escape.\n- Alphabet budget: 01/04 explicitly use disjoint subalphabets per role so sizes add, not multiply; with this, O(B)\u2013O(B^2) symbols is credible. 02 offers an O(B^3) worst-case fallback if we fully decouple tracks; pick \u03b2 = s^{c1} with c1 \u2265 2c0 (or 3c0 for extra slack) and stick to disjoint-role alphabets to keep |\u03a3_out| = \u0398(B)\u2013O(B^2).\n- Length normalization: All rely on pumping/replacement to guarantee canonical contexts at lengths \u2113_pump or \u2113_pump+1; this remains an assumption to be proven (or replaced by an explicit padding argument). Do not add it to output.md yet.\n\nValue/triage:\n- Genuine progress: explicit, radius-1 rule schemas for the probe and seam verdict; a local, token-based seam activation resolving mixed pairs (from 02); concrete B=2 test plan; reasonable alphabet and adjacency budgeting.\n- Outstanding: fully enumerated Cin\u2013out and Cout\u2013out tables (at least parametrically); explicit DP harness and B=2 instance; a rigorous length-normalization lemma.\n\nPromising direction and next steps:\n1) Adopt Prover 02\u2019s directional-token seam activation. Specify the exact S-adjacent and interior-adjacent Cout\u2013out pairs that: (i) propagate tokens deterministically; (ii) forbid \u22a5 and neutral neighbors at S only when the opposite-direction token is present; (iii) forbid ERR near RUN/VERD in active mode; and (iv) allow neutral fallback in mixed pairs.\n2) For probes, enumerate the allowed pairs for Start_j/Head_j/Test_j/Accept_j and PORT adjacency (Addr monotonicity) and list explicitly the omissions (no ERR/\u22a5 near probe states, no alternative successors).\n3) Produce a B=2 machine-readable instance (symbol list, Cin\u2013out, Cout\u2013out) and run the O(k\u03b2^2) DP to verify: (a) E_{L(u)}(a\u22c6)[Q_1,Q_2] = (u_1,u_2); (b) mixed-pair acceptance regardless of the color on the canonical side; (c) active-active acceptance behavior for a toy D (e.g., 4-cycle) including the Eq constraint.\n4) After B=2 validation, generalize the parametric tables for arbitrary B and give a short, self-contained padding lemma (r=1) to ensure canonical contexts exist at required lengths.\n5) Only then, promote Lemma TS (type separation), Lemma RG (per-side gating + must-color), and Lemma SG (seam tableau with local verdict) into output.md.\n",
  "new_notes_md": "Synthesis of gadgets and checks for the S3Col \u2192 F1 reduction (radius 1, \u03b2-normalized)\n\nCanonical vertex blocks and side-local gating\n- Left canonical block W_L(u) adjacent to S exposes a contiguous B-cell PORT zone with two subtracks present only when Role=PORT: Addr \u2208 {1,\u2026,B} and RIDbit \u2208 {0,1}. Cin\u2013out ties RIDbit to the input bit at that node. Addr must increase by +1 left\u2192right. The right canonical block W_R(v) is symmetric. Noncanonical interiors do not use Role=PORT and have only PAD/ERR/HEAD/RUN roles as appropriate.\n- Per-side gating: Only when the interior neighbor of S is a canonical gate token (GateL at S1\u2019s right neighbor or GateR at S2\u2019s left neighbor) is S allowed to carry a color {R,G,B}; otherwise S must be \u22a5. These permissions are enforced by Cout\u2013out on the S\u2194(interior) edges and are independent per side.\n\nPer-bit boundary probe (Type-Separation)\n- Reserve B boundary-output 4-tuples {Q_j} (one per j). Fix a boundary-input tuple a\u22c6 \u2208 \u03a3_in^4. Under Q_j, a deterministic \u201cprobe mode\u201d is forced from the left boundary through a corridor into the PORT zone:\n  \u2022 States per j: Start_j, Head_j (or Move_j/Test_j variants), Accept_j. While any of these is present, ERR/\u22a5 are disallowed in adjacent symbols.\n  \u2022 Movement rules: Start_j\u2192Head_j; Head_j marches rightward across non-PORT roles and across PORT cells whose Addr \u2260 j; at the unique cell with Addr=j, the successor is Test_j; Test_j transitions to Accept_j iff RIDbit=1, otherwise dead-ends; Accept_j deterministically exits to PAD.\n  \u2022 PORT well-formedness: local rules enforce a contiguous PORT block of length B with Addr=1,\u2026,B adjacent to S. Addr monotonicity and contiguity prevent the probe from skipping or looping.\n- Claim TS (informal): For a canonical left block L(u), E_{L(u)}(a\u22c6)[Q_j] = u_j. This is DP-checkable and relies purely on the above radius-1 pairs and Cin\u2013out.\n\nSeam activation, mixed pairs, and local verdict (adopt directional tokens)\n- Directional tokens: Introduce Tok\u2192 and Tok\u2190 that live only on the seam corridor cells (RUN/PAD roles). If the left side is canonical, the cell right of S1 seeds Tok\u2192=1 and it propagates deterministically to the right across the bridge; symmetrically, the right side seeds Tok\u2190=1 propagating to the left.\n- Must-color and fallback, locally enforced at S:\n  \u2022 If the opposite-direction token is present adjacent to S (Tok\u2190=1 at S2\u2019s neighbor; Tok\u2192=1 at S1\u2019s neighbor), then S cannot be \u22a5 and cannot attach to a neutral neighbor; it must attach to the seam verdict neighbor. This enforces \u201cmust-color\u201d only in active-active pairs.\n  \u2022 If the opposite-direction token is absent, a colored S can attach to neutral neighbors and \u22a5 is allowed; this yields unconditional acceptance in mixed pairs (exactly one token present) and inactive pairs (no token present).\n- RUN tableau and verdict: When both tokens are present (active-active), we run a fixed-width 1D tableau (role RUN) that reads enc(D) and the port bits u and v and computes two bits: EDGE := D(u,v) and Eq := [u=v]. The cell immediately right of S2 becomes V = VERD(FwdColor, EDGE, Eq), where FwdColor is a copy of S1\u2019s color forwarded along the seam via a local-equality track. ERR/\u22a5 are disabled adjacent to RUN/VERD in active mode.\n- Local acceptance at S2\u2013V: Forbid exactly those pairs that violate (A) EDGE=1 \u21d2 Color(S2) \u2260 FwdColor and (B) Eq=1 \u21d2 Color(S2) = FwdColor. Allow all pairs when EDGE=0 (for (A)) and when Eq=0 (for (B)). The diagonal D(u,u)=0 assumption avoids EDGE=1 \u2227 Eq=1 conflicts.\n\nAlphabet and adjacency budgeting\n- Disjoint role subalphabets ensure sizes add, not multiply: PORT symbols O(B) (2\u00d7 per bit for RIDbit), probe states O(B), reserved boundary tokens O(B), colors and \u22a5 (4), RUN/VERD/ERR/PAD/HEAD (O(1)). Thus |\u03a3_out| = \u0398(B) with slack; adjacency table contains O(B^2) allowed pairs for probe marching (Head_j \u2194 PORT@Addr=k) plus O(\u03b2) for other roles. Choose \u03b2 = s^{c1} with c1 \u2265 2c0 (or 3c0 conservatively) so \u03b2 = poly(s) and adjacency tables remain polynomial.\n\nLength normalization (status)\n- We will assume (to be proved or replaced by an explicit padding) that for each u there exists at least one left/right canonical context of length in {\u2113_pump, \u2113_pump+1} whose PORT abuts S. This is intended to follow from standard replacement/pumping lemmas for radius-1 types, pumping only in PAD so the probe/seam interfaces are unaffected.\n\nB=2 DP-auditable instance (to build next)\n- Symbols: colors {R,G,B,\u22a5}; PORT cells {P1^0,P1^1,P2^0,P2^1}; probe states {Start_1,Head_1,Test_1,Accept_1, Start_2,Head_2,Test_2,Accept_2}; boundary tokens for Q_1,Q_2; GATE_L/GATE_R; tokens Tok\u2192/Tok\u2190 \u2208 {0,1}; RUN alphabet (constant); VERD(c\u2208{R,G,B}, EDGE\u2208{0,1}, Eq\u2208{0,1}).\n- Checks to run by O(k\u03b2^2) DP: (i) For L(00), L(01), L(10), L(11), verify E(a\u22c6)[Q_1,Q_2] equals u. (ii) For a toy D (4-cycle), and all 16 ordered pairs (L(u),R(v)), verify: active-active acceptance iff inequality on edges and equality when u=v; mixed pairs accept unconditionally (colored canonical side; \u22a5 on the other).\n\nAudit checklist for table instantiation\n- Probes: enumerate allowed pairs for Start_j, Head_j, Test_j, Accept_j; no ERR/\u22a5 adjacent; PORT contiguity and Addr monotonicity; forbid all other successors.\n- Tokens: deterministic propagation; at S, forbid \u22a5 and neutral neighbors only when the opposite token is present; allow fallback otherwise.\n- Verdict: S2\u2013V adjacency list realizing (A) and (B); ERR disabled near RUN/VERD.\n- Cin\u2013out: tie RIDbit to inputs for PORT cells; limit other Cin\u2013out entries to the roles used at those nodes.\n",
