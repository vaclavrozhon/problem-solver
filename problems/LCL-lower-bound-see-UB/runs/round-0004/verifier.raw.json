The proposals are substantially clearer than prior rounds and move us toward a DP-auditable rule set. The most robust and fully local seam activation appears in Prover 02 via directional tokens; Provers 01 and 04 describe activation via “ActiveBridgeStart” or HL/HR flags but do not completely resolve the simultaneity/locality constraints without an explicit cross-seam mechanism. Prover 03’s statements are well-packaged as lemmas but understate the alphabet budget in places; the “O(B)” total budget is plausible only with strictly disjoint-role subalphabets (no unintended cross products), which should be stated and enforced.\\n\\nCorrectness/rigor audit:\\n- Per-bit probe (all provers): The deterministic pipeline (Start_j → Move/Head_j → Test_j → Accept_j) with ERR/⊥ disabled near probe states is solid and DP-checkable. Key to verify: (i) the PORT zone is contiguous and abuts S; (ii) Addr increments strictly; (iii) the only successor at Addr=j depends on RIDbit; (iv) no alternative successors from probe states. These are all expressible as radius-1 adjacency constraints. Budgeting O(B)–O(B^2) symbols/edges is fine under β = poly(s).\\n- Seam activation and mixed pairs: Prover 02’s directional tokens Tok→/Tok← give purely local conditions for (a) must-color only in active-active pairs and (b) unconditional acceptance for mixed pairs. Provers 01/04’s “simultaneous” activation requires either extra bits on S that depend on both neighbors or a cross-seam handshake; as stated, they leave a locality gap (a canonical side could spuriously enable its own ActiveBridgeStart without seeing the opposite side). Prefer 02’s token design.\\n- Verdict cell and constraints: The S2–V local adjacency enforcing both EDGE=1 ⇒ colors differ and Eq=1 ⇒ colors equal is coherent; the diagonal issue (EDGE∧Eq) is avoided by setting D(u,u)=0. Also ensure that in active-active mode ERR/⊥ are disabled adjacent to RUN/VERD to prevent escape.\\n- Alphabet budget: 01/04 explicitly use disjoint subalphabets per role so sizes add, not multiply; with this, O(B)–O(B^2) symbols is credible. 02 offers an O(B^3) worst-case fallback if we fully decouple tracks; pick β = s^{c1} with c1 ≥ 2c0 (or 3c0 for extra slack) and stick to disjoint-role alphabets to keep |Σ_out| = Θ(B)–O(B^2).\\n- Length normalization: All rely on pumping/replacement to guarantee canonical contexts at lengths ℓ_pump or ℓ_pump+1; this remains an assumption to be proven (or replaced by an explicit padding argument). Do not add it to output.md yet.\\n\\nValue/triage:\\n- Genuine progress: explicit, radius-1 rule schemas for the probe and seam verdict; a local, token-based seam activation resolving mixed pairs (from 02); concrete B=2 test plan; reasonable alphabet and adjacency budgeting.\\n- Outstanding: fully enumerated Cin–out and Cout–out tables (at least parametrically); explicit DP harness and B=2 instance; a rigorous length-normalization lemma.\\n\\nPromising direction and next steps:\\n1) Adopt Prover 02’s directional-token seam activation. Specify the exact S-adjacent and interior-adjacent Cout–out pairs that: (i) propagate tokens deterministically; (ii) forbid ⊥ and neutral neighbors at S only when the opposite-direction token is present; (iii) forbid ERR near RUN/VERD in active mode; and (iv) allow neutral fallback in mixed pairs.\\n2) For probes, enumerate the allowed pairs for Start_j/Head_j/Test_j/Accept_j and PORT adjacency (Addr monotonicity) and list explicitly the omissions (no ERR/⊥ near probe states, no alternative successors).\\n3) Produce a B=2 machine-readable instance (symbol list, Cin–out, Cout–out) and run the O(kβ^2) DP to verify: (a) E_{L(u)}(a⋆)[Q_1,Q_2] = (u_1,u_2); (b) mixed-pair acceptance regardless of the color on the canonical side; (c) active-active acceptance behavior for a toy D (e.g., 4-cycle) including the Eq constraint.\\n4) After B=2 validation, generalize the parametric tables for arbitrary B and give a short, self-contained padding lemma (r=1) to ensure canonical contexts exist at required lengths.\\n5) Only then, promote Lemma TS (type separation), Lemma RG (per-side gating + must-color), and Lemma SG (seam tableau with local verdict) into output.md.\\n\",\"new_notes_md\":\"Synthesis of gadgets and checks for the S3Col → F1 reduction (radius 1, β-normalized)\\n\\nCanonical vertex blocks and side-local gating\\n- Left canonical block W_L(u) adjacent to S exposes a contiguous B-cell PORT zone with two subtracks present only when Role=PORT: Addr ∈ {1,…,B} and RIDbit ∈ {0,1}. Cin–out ties RIDbit to the input bit at that node. Addr must increase by +1 left→right. The right canonical block W_R(v) is symmetric. Noncanonical interiors do not use Role=PORT and have only PAD/ERR/HEAD/RUN roles as appropriate.\\n- Per-side gating: Only when the interior neighbor of S is a canonical gate token (GateL at S1’s right neighbor or GateR at S2’s left neighbor) is S allowed to carry a color {R,G,B}; otherwise S must be ⊥. These permissions are enforced by Cout–out on the S↔(interior) edges and are independent per side.\\n\\nPer-bit boundary probe (Type-Separation)\\n- Reserve B boundary-output 4-tuples {Q_j} (one per j). Fix a boundary-input tuple a⋆ ∈ Σ_in^4. Under Q_j, a deterministic “probe mode” is forced from the left boundary through a corridor into the PORT zone:\\n  • States per j: Start_j, Head_j (or Move_j/Test_j variants), Accept_j. While any of these is present, ERR/⊥ are disallowed in adjacent symbols.\\n  • Movement rules: Start_j→Head_j; Head_j marches rightward across non-PORT roles and across PORT cells whose Addr ≠ j; at the unique cell with Addr=j, the successor is Test_j; Test_j transitions to Accept_j iff RIDbit=1, otherwise dead-ends; Accept_j deterministically exits to PAD.\\n  • PORT well-formedness: local rules enforce a contiguous PORT block of length B with Addr=1,…,B adjacent to S. Addr monotonicity and contiguity prevent the probe from skipping or looping.\\n- Claim TS (informal): For a canonical left block L(u), E_{L(u)}(a⋆)[Q_j] = u_j. This is DP-checkable and relies purely on the above radius-1 pairs and Cin–out.\\n\\nSeam activation, mixed pairs, and local verdict (adopt directional tokens)\\n- Directional tokens: Introduce Tok→ and Tok← that live only on the seam corridor cells (RUN/PAD roles). If the left side is canonical, the cell right of S1 seeds Tok→=1 and it propagates deterministically to the right across the bridge; symmetrically, the right side seeds Tok←=1 propagating to the left.\\n- Must-color and fallback, locally enforced at S:\\n  • If the opposite-direction token is present adjacent to S (Tok←=1 at S2’s neighbor; Tok→=1 at S1’s neighbor), then S cannot be ⊥ and cannot attach to a neutral neighbor; it must attach to the seam verdict neighbor. This enforces “must-color” only in active-active pairs.\\n  • If the opposite-direction token is absent, a colored S can attach to neutral neighbors and ⊥ is allowed; this yields unconditional acceptance in mixed pairs (exactly one token present) and inactive pairs (no token present).\\n- RUN tableau and verdict: When both tokens are present (active-active), we run a fixed-width 1D tableau (role RUN) that reads enc(D) and the port bits u and v and computes two bits: EDGE := D(u,v) and Eq := [u=v]. The cell immediately right of S2 becomes V = VERD(FwdColor, EDGE, Eq), where FwdColor is a copy of S1’s color forwarded along the seam via a local-equality track. ERR/⊥ are disabled adjacent to RUN/VERD in active mode.\\n- Local acceptance at S2–V: Forbid exactly those pairs that violate (A) EDGE=1 ⇒ Color(S2) ≠ FwdColor and (B) Eq=1 ⇒ Color(S2) = FwdColor. Allow all pairs when EDGE=0 (for (A)) and when Eq=0 (for (B)). The diagonal D(u,u)=0 assumption avoids EDGE=1 ∧ Eq=1 conflicts.\\n\\nAlphabet and adjacency budgeting\\n- Disjoint role subalphabets ensure sizes add, not multiply: PORT symbols O(B) (2× per bit for RIDbit), probe states O(B), reserved boundary tokens O(B), colors and ⊥ (4), RUN/VERD/ERR/PAD/HEAD (O(1)). Thus |Σ_out| = Θ(B) with slack; adjacency table contains O(B^2) allowed pairs for probe marching (Head_j ↔ PORT@Addr=k) plus O(β) for other roles. Choose β = s^{c1} with c1 ≥ 2c0 (or 3c0 conservatively) so β = poly(s) and adjacency tables remain polynomial.\\n\\nLength normalization (status)\\n- We will assume (to be proved or replaced by an explicit padding) that for each u there exists at least one left/right canonical context of length in {ℓ_pump, ℓ_pump+1} whose PORT abuts S. This is intended to follow from standard replacement/pumping lemmas for radius-1 types, pumping only in PAD so the probe/seam interfaces are unaffected.\\n\\nB=2 DP-auditable instance (to build next)\\n- Symbols: colors {R,G,B,⊥}; PORT cells {P1^0,P1^1,P2^0,P2^1}; probe states {Start_1,Head_1,Test_1,Accept_1, Start_2,Head_2,Test_2,Accept_2}; boundary tokens for Q_1,Q_2; GATE_L/GATE_R; tokens Tok→/Tok← ∈ {0,1}; RUN alphabet (constant); VERD(c∈{R,G,B}, EDGE∈{0,1}, Eq∈{0,1}).\\n- Checks to run by O(kβ^2) DP: (i) For L(00), L(01), L(10), L(11), verify E(a⋆)[Q_1,Q_2] equals u. (ii) For a toy D (4-cycle), and all 16 ordered pairs (L(u),R(v)), verify: active-active acceptance iff inequality on edges and equality when u=v; mixed pairs accept unconditionally (colored canonical side; ⊥ on the other).\\n\\nAudit checklist for table instantiation\\n- Probes: enumerate allowed pairs for Start_j, Head_j, Test_j, Accept_j; no ERR/⊥ adjacent; PORT contiguity and Addr monotonicity; forbid all other successors.\\n- Tokens: deterministic propagation; at S, forbid ⊥ and neutral neighbors only when the opposite token is present; allow fallback otherwise.\\n- Verdict: S2–V adjacency list realizing (A) and (B); ERR disabled near RUN/VERD.\\n- Cin–out: tie RIDbit to inputs for PORT cells; limit other Cin–out entries to the roles used at those nodes.\\n\",\"new_notes_append\":\"True\",\"new_outputs_md\":\"\",\"new_outputs_append\":\"True\",\"verdict\":\"partial success\"}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"auto","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"VerifierNewSchema","schema_":{"properties":{"feedback_md":{"title":"Feedback Md","type":"string"},"new_notes_md":{"title":"New Notes Md","type":"string"},"new_notes_append":{"title":"New Notes Append","type":"string"},"new_outputs_md":{"title":"New Outputs Md","type":"string"},"new_outputs_append":{"title":"New Outputs Append","type":"string"},"verdict":{"title":"Verdict","type":"string"}},"required":["feedback_md","new_notes_md","new_notes_append","new_outputs_md","new_outputs_append","verdict"],"title":"VerifierNewSchema","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":22180,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":9522,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":6848},"total_tokens":31702},"user":null,"store":true}
