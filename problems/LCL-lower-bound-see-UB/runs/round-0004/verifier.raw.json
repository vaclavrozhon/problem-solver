You identified and targeted the two key failure modes from earlier rounds: (i) trivializing F2 via ⊥ on repeats and (ii) sign cheating at S. The barrier idea for F2 and the split S1/S2 palettes plus CAP-gating for sign are on the right track. The exclusivity sketch (Eq vs Neq) is also in the standard form. However, there are two serious consistency issues that must be fixed before we can accept anything into outputs.md.\\n\\n1) Static vs “phase” tokens at S. The outer-seam rules currently forbid EqStart/NeqStart/CAP/PAD on the L→S1 and S2→R seams. But the central seam requires those same tokens at S1/S2 to run the certificate. In a static radius-1 constraint model, S1/S2 have a single symbol shared across both edges; if the outer seams forbid these tokens, the central seam cannot ever use them. The present tables therefore make certificates impossible. Proposed fix: split the S1/S2 state into subtracks: a stable choice subtrack (S1.truth ∈ {VT,VF} or ⊥; S2.occ ∈ {O1,O2,O3} or ⊥) and a phase/cursor subtrack (Idle, EqStart, EqL[b], NeqStart, NeqCheckL[b], CAP, PAD, …). Then:\\n- Outer seams constrain only the choice subtrack: AccVar forces S1.truth ∈ {VT,VF} (not ⊥), Neutral/Bar forces S1.truth=⊥; similarly on the right. They also require phase=Neutral when truth/occ=⊥.\\n- Central seam gates the phase/cursor subtrack, and may additionally check choice bits (e.g., CAP requires sign-compatible S1.truth). This lifts the contradiction.\\n\\n2) “Idle freeze” vs certificate motion. You state that active left “freezes S1 to an idle truth token,” yet later you need S1 to carry EqStart/EqL[b]/CAP. The above subtrack split resolves this: S1.truth is frozen; S1.phase can be any of the cursor states as allowed by central seam. Please revise the seam tables accordingly. Concretely, your Left seam table should allow any S1.phase when RoleL=AccVar, but disallow any non-neutral phase when RoleL∈{NeutralVar,BarVar}.\\n\\nFurther points to tighten:\\n- Read-only mirroring: You rely on S1/S2 “read-only subtracks” that mirror RIDbits/ip_bits. Please specify the exact edge constraints implementing these copies: for each b, the pair (lane-bit=b, S1.lbit[b]=b) must be required on the AccVar→S1 edge; similarly for S2 and Selected(ip). Also define how Selected ties to Op via RUN without enabling spoofing (list the exact pairings and the error-chain trigger).\\n- Exclusivity E′: The logic is sound assuming the mirroring is correct and the Neq checks only permit PAD when a true mismatch is seen. Please tabulate the allowed central pairs for all b in B=2 to make this check fully explicit, and include the CAP-gate that compares S1.truth with sgn[p].\\n- Barrier semantics: You say “allow only PAD plumbing and forbid any Eq/Neq/CAP/PAD cursor token,” which is contradictory (PAD is a cursor token). Clarify: typically barriers should forbid EqStart/EqL/NeqStart/NeqCheck/CAP/PAD entirely and force S1/S2.phase=Neutral and S1.truth=S2.occ=⊥ at non-nearest interfaces; PAD-only conduits should be purely central-seam artifacts, not traversing barriers.\\n- Both-sides-offer gating: After adopting the subtrack split, central seam can enforce that non-neutral phases (EqStart, NeqStart, CAP, PAD, cursors) appear only when S1.truth≠⊥ and S2.occ≠⊥. Outer seams enforce those conditions locally.\\n\\nValue triage:\\n- Solid and valuable: split S1/S2 palettes; CAP sign-check; per-bit Eq/Neq comparators; barrier idea for F2; B=2 trace structure.\\n- Needs revision: outer seam forbidding certificate tokens; barrier text regarding PAD; details of mirroring and Selected/HotRID; a formal count and the exact pair tables.\\n\\nConcrete next steps:\\n1) Redefine S1/S2 as product palettes with explicit subtracks (truth/occ and phase), and rewrite all three seam tables accordingly. Provide full tables for the B=2 case.\\n2) Explicitly list the edge-pair constraints that mirror RIDbits/ip_bits into S1/S2, and the Selected↔RUN wiring and its error-chain refutation.\\n3) Tabulate central-seam allowed pairs for: Idle, EqStart, EqL[0], EqL[1], CAP; NeqStart, NeqCheck[0], NeqCheck[1], PAD; and the disallowed cross-cases. Include the CAP sign gate.\\n4) State and prove the short lemma: barriers placed one node past the RUN footer force S1.truth=S2.occ=⊥ and S1/S2.phase=Neutral at non-nearest interfaces, hence only the nearest blocks can participate in certificates; conclude F2.\\n5) Provide an alphabet-size count showing β=poly(s) still holds after the split and added subtracks.\\n6) Re-run the B=2 ON/OFF trace with the corrected outer-seam tables (phase allowed when active).\",\"new_notes_md\":\"Seam and certificate design (2025-08-27, PM update)\\n\\nKey corrections to the seam model\\n- The S nodes must carry a single static symbol visible on both edges. To allow certificates while still enforcing local activation, encode S1 and S2 as product palettes with subtracks:\\n  - S1.truth ∈ {⊥, VT, VF} and S1.phase ∈ {Neutral, Idle, EqStart, EqL[b], NeqStart, NeqCheckL[b], CAP, PAD, …}.\\n  - S2.occ ∈ {⊥, O1, O2, O3} and S2.phase ∈ {Neutral, Idle, EqStart, EqR[b], NeqStart, NeqCheckR[b], CAP, PAD, …}.\\n  The “choice” subtracks (truth/occ) are long-lived; the “phase” subtracks host cursors/certificates.\\n- Outer seams constrain only the choice subtracks and forbid non-neutral phases when inactive:\\n  - Left seam (L→S1): if RoleL=AccVar then S1.truth∈{VT,VF}; if RoleL∈{NeutralVar,BarVar} then S1.truth=⊥ and S1.phase=Neutral. No restriction on S1.phase when RoleL=AccVar beyond disallowing contradictions with barriers (see below).\\n  - Right seam (S2→R): symmetrical: AccCla forces S2.occ∈{O1,O2,O3}; Neutral/Bar forces S2.occ=⊥ and S2.phase=Neutral.\\n- Central seam gates phases and checks choices:\\n  - Idle alignment: allow only (S1.phase=Idle, S2.phase=Idle) paired with consistent (S1.truth,S2.occ) choices.\\n  - Start: allow (EqStart,EqStart) and (NeqStart,NeqStart) only if S1.truth≠⊥ and S2.occ≠⊥.\\n  - Cursors: allow (EqL[b],EqR[b]) iff the mirrored bit subtracks agree; allow (NeqCheckL[b],NeqCheckR[b]) iff the bits differ.\\n  - Terminals: allow (CAP,CAP) only after Eq reaches b=B and if sign gate holds: (S1.truth=VT and sgn[p]=+) or (S1.truth=VF and sgn[p]=−). Allow (PAD,PAD) only after a valid NeqCheck.\\n\\nMirroring and integrity\\n- Bit mirroring to S1/S2: For each b, enforce on the outer seams that S1.lbit[b]=RIDbits[b] (left) and S2.rbit[b]=ip_bits[b] (right). These S-local read-only subtracks are then visible to the central seam comparator.\\n- Selected pointer on the clause side: Introduce a subtrack Selected[b] that equals ip_bits[b] only when S2.occ=Op and the RUN-phase token for Op is present; otherwise trigger an error-chain that forces RoleR=NeutralCla, hence S2.occ=⊥ by the outer seam. This blocks spoofing of ip_bits or sign.\\n\\nBarriers and F2\\n- Place BarVar/BarCla exactly one node past the RUN footer. Barriers impose: (i) Role•=Bar• forces outer seams to require S•.choice=⊥ and S•.phase=Neutral; (ii) forbid any cursor/terminal phases on the adjacent edges. Consequently, only the nearest blocks can participate in Eq/Neq certificates, and repeats beyond the nearest blocks do not affect the bridge outcome (F2).\\n\\nExclusivity E′ (sketch)\\n- Assuming correct mirroring and Selected wiring: if RID=ip, Eq advances to b=B and yields CAP; Neq has no b with mismatch and cannot place PAD. If RID≠ip, pick a mismatching b; Neq yields PAD; Eq stalls before CAP. CAP additionally requires sign compatibility with S1.truth.\\n\\nB=2 worked example (to re-run after table fix)\\n- ON case: RID=10, pick O2 with sgn2=−, S1.truth=VF. With corrected outer seams (phase allowed when active), EqStart→EqL/R[0]=0 matches→EqL/R[1]=1 matches→CAP; CAP passes sign gate since VF with −.\\n- OFF case: RID=10, pick O1 with ip=01. Eq stalls at b=1; Neq picks b=1 and produces PAD; sign is irrelevant for PAD.\\n\\nOpen items\\n- Enumerate exact edge-pair tables for B=2 (left, central, right seams), including all cursor phases and the sign gate.\\n- List the Selected↔RUN and HotRID/RIDbits (if still used) tiles and the error-chain pairs that deactivate malformed blocks.\\n- Provide the alphabet-size count ensuring β=poly(s).\\n- Short proofs: (i) non-nearest seams forced Neutral by barriers in ≤1 step; (ii) both-sides-offer gating via central start and outer choice constraints.\",\"new_notes_append\":\"True\",\"new_outputs_md\":\"\",\"new_outputs_append\":\"True\",\"verdict\":\"uncertain\"}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"auto","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"VerifierNewSchema","schema_":{"properties":{"feedback_md":{"title":"Feedback Md","type":"string"},"new_notes_md":{"title":"New Notes Md","type":"string"},"new_notes_append":{"title":"New Notes Append","type":"string"},"new_outputs_md":{"title":"New Outputs Md","type":"string"},"new_outputs_append":{"title":"New Outputs Append","type":"string"},"verdict":{"title":"Verdict","type":"string"}},"required":["feedback_md","new_notes_md","new_notes_append","new_outputs_md","new_outputs_append","verdict"],"title":"VerifierNewSchema","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":5631,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":9778,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":7424},"total_tokens":15409},"user":null,"store":true}
