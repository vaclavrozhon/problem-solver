High-level: This is a substantial and mostly coherent refinement of the seam and certificate mechanism. You identified and targeted the two key failure modes from earlier rounds: (i) trivializing F2 via ⊥ on repeats and (ii) sign cheating at S. The barrier idea for F2 and the split S1/S2 palettes plus CAP-gating for sign are on the right track. The exclusivity sketch (Eq vs Neq) is also in the standard form. However, there are two serious consistency issues that must be fixed before we can accept anything into outputs.md.
