Overall assessment: The four reports converge on the same three core gadgets (per-bit boundary probes, per-side color gating, and a seam tableau with a local verdict). The proposals are substantially clearer than prior rounds and move us toward a DP-auditable rule set. The most robust and fully local seam activation appears in Prover 02 via directional tokens; Provers 01 and 04 describe activation via “ActiveBridgeStart” or HL/HR flags but do not completely resolve the simultaneity/locality constraints without an explicit cross-seam mechanism. Prover 03’s statements are well-packaged as lemmas but understate the alphabet budget in places; the “O(B)” total budget is plausible only with strictly disjoint-role subalphabets (no unintended cross products), which should be stated and enforced.
