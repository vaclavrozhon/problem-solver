  "progress_md": "Round 0005 \u2014 Parametric, radius-1 rule schemas you can DP-check; adopting directional tokens\n\nContext and objective\n- We adopt the verifier\u2019s recommendation to use directional tokens for seam activation. This round supplies explicit, radius-1 Cout\u2013out (and the relevant Cin\u2013out) rule schemas that are ready to be instantiated (especially for B=2) and verified by the O(k\u03b2^2) DP. We also give a short, specialized padding lemma (radius 1) to justify canonical contexts at lengths in {\u2113_pump, \u2113_pump+1} without changing near-S behavior.\n\nA. Per-bit probe: explicit local rules (Type-Separation TS)\nSymbols/tracks (folded into \u03a3_out; disjoint role subalphabets so sizes add):\n- Boundary outputs: for each j\u2208[B], four reserved tokens Q^L1_j, Q^L2_j, Q^R2_j, Q^R1_j. All non-reserved boundary outputs are ordinary tokens Bnd\u2022.\n- PORT zone (adjacent to S on canonical left): Port^I(k,b) and Port^P(k,b) for k\u2208[B], b\u2208{0,1}. Port^I used in idle, Port^P in probe mode; both carry (Role=PORT, Addr=k, RIDbit=b).\n- Probe states per j: Start_j, Head_j, Test_j, Accept_j (Role=PROBE). No other role has ProbeHead\u2260None.\nCin\u2013out constraints:\n- When Role=PORT, RIDbit equals the node\u2019s input bit; otherwise unrestricted.\nCout\u2013out pairs (all omitted pairs are illegal):\n- Boundary injection (reserved probes only): (Q^L1_j, Q^L2_j) and (Q^L2_j, Start_j). No other successor from Q^L2_j.\n- Corridor marching to PORT[1]: (Start_j, Head_j). For any non-PORT corridor cell y, (Head_j_prev, Head_j_y). No pairs from Head_j to ERR/\u22a5 (disables escape).\n- Entering PORT and scan-by-address:\n  \u2022 For any k,b: (Head_j_prev, Port^P(k,b)).\n  \u2022 If k\u2260j: (Port^P(k,b), Head_j_next) (head keeps moving).\n  \u2022 If k=j and b=1: (Port^P(j,1), Test_j), then (Test_j, Accept_j). If k=j and b=0: Test_j has no legal successor (dead-end). No (Test_j,\u2022) except (Test_j,Accept_j).\n- Accept exit to PAD: (Accept_j, PAD), and then PAD self-loops.\n- Mode exclusivity: Any adjacency involving Start_j/Head_j/Test_j/Accept_j appears only under Q_j; there are no pairs from PAD/HEAD/PORT^I into any PROBE state. Thus PROBE states cannot spontaneously appear unless Q_j is used.\n- PORT contiguity/monotonicity (independent of probes): For consecutive PORT cells x\u2192y, allowed pairs enforce Addr(x)+1=Addr(y), starting at Addr=1 and ending at Addr=B. This makes a contiguous block abutting S; non-PORT intrusions in between have no legal pairs with PORT neighbors.\nClaim TS (restated, DP-checkable): For canonical L(u) with a well-formed contiguous PORT zone at S, and fixed boundary inputs a\u22c6, the DP on the 4-node boundary with outputs Q_j accepts iff u_j=1, hence E_{L(u)}(a\u22c6)[Q_j]=u_j. Determinism comes from unique successors and the prohibition of ERR/\u22a5 near PROBE.\n\nB. Per-side color gating and seam activation with directional tokens\nSymbols/tracks:\n- S-color tokens at the two S nodes: S_\u22a5, S_R, S_G, S_B.\n- Gate tokens adjacent to S inside canonical blocks: GateL on left interior neighbor of S1; GateR on right interior neighbor of S2.\n- Corridor roles across the bridge wb\u2218wc: RUN, PAD, VERD (verdict cell role). Each corridor symbol encodes Tok\u2192,Tok\u2190\u2208{0,1} (two bits) used only on corridor roles.\nLocal gating at S (Cout\u2013out pairs touching S and its interior neighbor):\n- Permission: If neighbor is GateL (resp. GateR), allow S\u2208{S_R,S_G,S_B,S_\u22a5} on that side; else only S_\u22a5 allowed. This is per-side, independent.\nDirectional token seeding (purely local):\n- If the interior neighbor is GateL and S1\u2208{S_R,S_G,S_B}, then the immediate corridor cell to the right of S1 must have Tok\u2192=1; otherwise Tok\u2192=0.\n- If the interior neighbor is GateR and S2\u2208{S_R,S_G,S_B}, then the immediate corridor cell to the left of S2 must have Tok\u2190=1; otherwise Tok\u2190=0.\nToken propagation (deterministic):\n- For any corridor edge x\u2192y, allowed iff Tok\u2192(y) \u2265 Tok\u2192(x) and Tok\u2190(y) \u2265 Tok\u2190(x), and once a token bit becomes 1 it stays 1 across the entire bridge (monotone propagation). Concretely, list the four allowed bit-pairs per edge: (0,0)\u2192(0,0), (1,0)\u2192(1,0), (0,1)\u2192(0,1), (1,1)\u2192(1,1). Disallow any decrease.\nMust-color and mixed-pair fallback (local checks at S):\n- If the interior neighbor\u2019s Tok bit from the opposite side is 1 (Tok\u2192 at S1\u2019s neighbor; Tok\u2190 at S2\u2019s), then the only allowed S tokens are S_R,S_G,S_B (forbid S_\u22a5). Also, in this case S must attach to a non-PAD verdict/corridor neighbor (see C below); attaching to neutral PAD is forbidden. If the opposite token bit is 0, both S_\u22a5 and S_{R,G,B} are allowed and may attach to PAD neighbors (mixed/inactive acceptance).\nRemark: These three rules ensure: (i) only canonical sides can choose colors; (ii) must-color is enforced only in active-active (both tokens present); and (iii) mixed pairs accept via PAD-only plumbing.\n\nC. RUN tableau and verdict cell with local EDGE/Eq gate\nVerdict neighbor format:\n- The cell immediately to the right of S2 (inside the corridor) takes a role VERD(e,q,c) with e=EDGE\u2208{0,1}, q=Eq\u2208{0,1}, and c=FwdColor\u2208{R,G,B}. A 1-bit forwarder track copies S1\u2019s color along the corridor; pairwise neighbor equalities enforce consistency until VERD.\nLocal acceptance at S2\u2194VERD (enumerable finite list):\n- Allowed pairs (S2, VERD(e,q,c)) exactly when both constraints hold:\n  \u2022 If e=1, then S2\u2019s color \u2260 c; else (e=0) no restriction.\n  \u2022 If q=1, then S2\u2019s color = c; else (q=0) no restriction.\n- Concretely: for e=0,q=0 allow all 3\u00d73 color pairs; e=1,q=0 allow all unequal pairs; e=0,q=1 allow only (S2=c); e=1,q=1 allow none (this case should be unreachable if D(u,u)=0; if it occurs due to a malformed tableau, the instance correctly dead-ends).\nRUN corridor robustness and activation:\n- When both Tok\u2192=Tok\u2190=1 (active-active), Cout\u2013out permits only RUN/VERD states (no ERR/\u22a5) and requires a well-formed row-by-row simulation of U that reads (enc(D), u, v). Any malformed step has no legal continuation (local refutation). When at least one token is 0, RUN/VERD symbols are disallowed and PAD plumbing is allowed.\n\nD. B=2 auditable micro-instance (symbol list and key pairs)\nSymbols (minimal set):\n- S: S_\u22a5, S_R, S_G, S_B.\n- PORT (left): Port^I(1,0/1), Port^I(2,0/1), Port^P(1,0/1), Port^P(2,0/1).\n- Probe: Start_1, Head_1, Test_1, Accept_1; Start_2, Head_2, Test_2, Accept_2.\n- Boundary: Q^L1_1,Q^L2_1,Q^R2_1,Q^R1_1 and same for j=2; also generic Bnd\u2022 tokens.\n- Gate: GateL, GateR.\n- Corridor: PAD_00, PAD_10, PAD_01, PAD_11 (PAD with Tok\u2192Tok\u2190 bits), and VERD(c\u2208{R,G,B}, e\u2208{0,1}, q\u2208{0,1}); RUN_x (finite work alphabet, omitted here but locally checked).\nKey Cout\u2013out pairs (subsample; full set by schemas A\u2013C):\n- Probes: (Q^L2_1, Start_1), (Start_1, Head_1), (Head_1, Port^P(1,b)), (Port^P(1,1), Test_1), (Test_1, Accept_1), (Accept_1, PAD_00), (Head_1, Port^P(2,b)), (Port^P(2,b), Head_1). Mirror for j=2.\n- PORT contiguity: (Port^I(1,\u2022), Port^I(2,\u2022)) allowed; (Port^I(2,\u2022), non-PORT) terminates block; no other cross.\n- Gating at S1: (GateL, S_{R/G/B/\u22a5}) allowed; (non-GateL, S_\u22a5) only. Similarly for S2 and GateR.\n- Token seeding/propagation: From GateL with S1\u2208{R,G,B} require the right neighbor be PAD/RUN with Tok\u2192=1; else Tok\u2192=0. Along corridor, (PAD_ab, PAD_ab) and (PAD_a b, PAD_a b) with nondecreasing bits as above.\n- Must-color: If the cell next to S2 has Tok\u2190=1, forbid (S_\u22a5, \u2022) and forbid attachment to bare PAD; require the neighbor be VERD or a RUN boundary state. If Tok\u2190=0, allow (S_any, PAD_\u20220) freely.\n- Verdict: enumerate allowed (S2_color, VERD(e,q,c)) as per C.\nDP audit steps:\n1) Build L(00), L(01), L(10), L(11) with a length-2 PORT zone abutting S and seed HEAD/PAD elsewhere. Fix a\u22c6. Verify E_{L(u)}(a\u22c6)[Q_1]=u_1 and E_{L(u)}(a\u22c6)[Q_2]=u_2.\n2) Define a toy D on 4 vertices (00\u201301\u201311\u201310\u201300). Implement U as a constant table writing VERD(e,q,c) with q=1 iff u=v and e=1 on edges. For all 16 ordered pairs (L(u),R(v)): active-active accepts iff [(edge \u21d2 colors differ) \u2227 (u=v \u21d2 colors equal)]. Mixed pairs (exactly one Gate) accept for any color on the canonical side and \u22a5 on the other.\n\nE. Padding lemma for canonical contexts (radius 1, specialized)\nLemma Pad (explicit). Fix any finite \u201cnear-S\u201d pattern W (HEAD\u00b7PORT(B)\u00b7RUN), and a PAD filler P (Role=PAD) whose Type(P^t) stabilizes by t\u2265t0 (exists by Lemma 15). For each large \u2113\u2208{\u2113_pump, \u2113_pump+1}, there exists t such that |P^t\u00b7W|=\u2113 and Type(P^t\u00b7W) depends only on Type(W) (independent of t once t\u2265t0). Moreover, since PAD never uses PROBE/RUN/PORT roles, the probe/seam interfaces at S are unchanged.\nProof sketch: By periodicity of Type(P^t) and replacement (Lemma 11), increasing t beyond t0 does not change Type(P^t\u00b7W). Adjust t by at most 1 to hit the desired length. Apply symmetrically on the right. Hence canonical contexts with PORT abutting S exist at both target lengths without altering the gadgets.\n\nF. Budget and locality recap (for the tables you will instantiate)\n- Disjoint role subalphabets (S, PORT, PROBE, GATE, PAD, RUN, VERD, BOUNDARY) prevent unintended cross-products; sizes add. Dominant counts: O(B) PORT symbols (both I/P variants) and O(B) probe states. Adjacency table has O(B^2) nonzeros from (Head_j\u2194Port^P(k,\u2022)) and a constant number elsewhere. Choose \u03b2 \u2265 c\u00b7B^2.\n\nGaps/clarifications in output.md\n- None critical remain; output.md already states the \u201cfixed interior inputs\u201d interpretation parenthetically in Definitions. You may consider adding a short note that C (context types) is realized by w_1 S w_2 with |w_i|\u2208{\u2113_pump,\u2113_pump+1}, hence |C|\u2264\u2113_pump (used implicitly in our verifier loops).\n\nNext steps (auditable)\n1) Instantiate the above schemas for B=2: provide the full Cin\u2013out mask (RIDbit copy) and the complete Cout\u2013out table fragment covering A\u2013D.\n2) Run the O(k\u03b2^2) DP to validate TS and the seam behavior on all 16 pairs; include traces for any failing pair (none expected).\n3) Generalize the B=2 tables parametrically to arbitrary B (the only growth is in the families {Port^\u2022(k,\u00b7)} and {Start/Head/Test/Accept}_j and {Q}_j).\n4) Incorporate Lemma Pad (E) into output.md as a short lemma once the DP confirms behavior.\n5) Package the S3Col\u2192FFE(F1) reduction with these gadgets; ensure \u22a5-plumbing makes (F2) vacuous, concluding NEXPTIME-hardness of the 3-way classifier in this explicit model."
