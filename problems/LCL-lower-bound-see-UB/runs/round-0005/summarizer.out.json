  "summary_md": "This round fixes the verifier\u2019s two seam inconsistencies by splitting each S-node into S1 (variable side) and S2 (clause side) with separate choice and phase subtracks, adding offer bits and read-only lbit/rbit mirrors, and specifying Selected (sgnsel) wiring. Outer seams enforce mirroring/pointer-exposure and offer gating; central seam (B=2) has an explicit allowed-pair table (Idle, EqStart, EqL[b]/EqR[b], NeqStart, NeqPick[b]/NeqCheck[b], CAP/PAD) synchronizing phases but leaving bit-tests to local pointer-integrity lanes. Pointer-integrity uses Address\u2013RIDbit\u2013Return triads and comparator tiles; Selected=1 activates exactly one clause bundle, with any inconsistency triggering a 1\u20132 step error-chain that flips Role\u2192Neutral. The Barrier Lemma places Bar nodes adjacent to each block footer so only nearest blocks can participate in a certificate; this enforces (F2) automatically (no \u22a5-plumbing). Exclusivity (E\u2032) follows: RID=ip enables (CAP,CAP) only, RID\u2260ip enables (PAD,PAD) only. Alphabet size remains poly(s)+O(B) = poly(s). Citations: prover-01.out.json (progress_md).",

    "Resolved seam contradictions by splitting S into S1/S2 with separate truth/occ, phase, offer, and mirrored bit lanes.",
    "Explicit B=2 central-seam pair table synchronizes phases (Idle, Eq*, Neq*, CAP/PAD) while bit-tests live in local pointer lanes.",
    "Pointer-integrity: Address\u2013RIDbit\u2013Return triads plus comparator tiles enforce equality/inequality locally; mismatches trigger error-chains flipping Role\u2192Neutral within \u22642 steps.",
    "Selected wiring: exactly one clause bundle marked Selected=1; any Selected/inconsistency mismatch produces a local deactivation (RoleR\u2192NeutralCla).",
    "Barrier Lemma: nearest-block barriers force choices=\u22a5 and phase=Neutral beyond nearest blocks, so (F2) holds without \u22a5-fill.",
    "Exclusivity E\u2032: RID=ip permits (CAP,CAP) iff sign matches; RID\u2260ip permits (PAD,PAD); mutual exclusion enforced by seam tables and local markers."

    "Provide the explicit pointer-lane tile list (Address\u2013RIDbit\u2013Return tiles) and the 1\u20132 step error-chain transitions that flip Role\u25cf\u2192Neutral\u25cf for formal completeness.",
    "Expand the B=2 central-seam schema into the concrete out\u2013out pair list (12\u201316 explicit pairs) the verifier can check by hand and supply a micro-count of |\u03a3out| with chosen parameters c0,c1.",
    "Update the hardness writeup: replace Section B.6's \u22a5-based (F2) with the Barrier Lemma and add the formal short proof that repeats cannot influence a seam certificate beyond nearest blocks."
