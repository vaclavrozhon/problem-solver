  "summary_md": "Round 0005 delivered DP-checkable, radius-1 rule schemas that complete the S3Col\u2192FFE(F1) reduction skeleton. Main building blocks: deterministic per-bit probes (Start/Head/Test/Accept + contiguous PORT) that separate 2^B types; per-side gating with directional tokens Tok\u2192/Tok\u2190 that are seeded only for canonical colored sides and propagate monotonically so RUN/VERD activate only in active\u2013active pairs; a one-cell VERD(e,q,cFwd) next to S2 whose allowed S2\u2194VERD pairs simultaneously enforce EDGE and Eq (with D(u,u)=0 to avoid contradictions); a bridging design that confines all constraints to a constant-width corridor so (F2) is vacuous/z-invariant; and a radius-1 padding lemma that guarantees canonical contexts at lengths \u2113_pump or \u2113_pump+1. A concrete B=2 skeleton (\u224845 symbols, O(10^2) adjacency pairs) and a DP audit checklist (16 seam cases + 4 probe seeds) were supplied.

    "Deterministic radius-1 probes: the Start\u2192Head\u2192Test\u2192Accept pipeline with PORT contiguity gives a DP-checkable Type-Separation (E_{L(u)}(a*)[Q_j] = u_j) and forbids ERR/\u22a5 escape near probe states.",
    "Directional tokens Tok\u2192/Tok\u2190 seeded by GateL/GateR + colored S; monotone propagation (no 0\u21921 without seed) ensures RUN/VERD only appear when both tokens are 1, so must-color applies only to active\u2013active pairs; mixed pairs accept vacuously.",
    "Local VERD cell: VERD(e,q,cFwd) adjacent to S2 enforces (e=1 \u21d2 colors differ) and (q=1 \u21d2 colors equal) via an explicit finite S2\u2194VERD adjacency table; D(u,u)=0 prevents e\u2227q contradictions.",
    "B=2 DP-auditable blueprint: an explicit symbol list (~45 symbols across disjoint-role subalphabets) and key Cin\u2013out/Cout\u2013out fragments were given; adjacency table size is ~O(10^2) \u2014 feasible with \u03b2\u2265c\u00b7B^2.",
    "Bridging/F2 locality: all seam constraints live in a constant-width corridor (FWD, RUN rows, VERD); feasibility for z=1 implies feasibility for all z \u2265 1. A radius-1 padding lemma ensures canonical PORT-abutting contexts at lengths \u2113_pump or \u2113_pump+1.",
    "Main risks addressed: forbidden ERR/\u22a5 near PROBE/RUN/VERD prevents escapes; seeding+monotone token rules prevent spurious activation; PORT contiguity enforces unique scanning behavior."

  "next_questions": [
    "Produce the final machine-readable B=2 instance (complete \u03a3_out, full Cin\u2013out list tying RIDbit to inputs, and exhaustive Cout\u2013out adjacency pairs) and run the O(k\u00b7\u03b2^2) DP to validate the 4 probe seeds and all 16 seam (L(u),R(v)) cases; save/attach DP traces for any failing case.",
    "Generalize the instantiated tables to arbitrary B (add Head_j/Test_j/Accept_j and Port(k,\u00b7) families), produce an explicit adjacency budget \u03b2(B) (showing \u03b2 = \u0398(B^2) suffices), and formalize Lemmas TS, RG (gating+tokens), SG (seam verdict) and the padding lemma into output.md.",
    "If the DP still reports failures (verifier\u2019s \u201cpartial success\u201d), collect minimal counterexamples (DP traces) highlighting missing/extra Cout\u2013out pairs (likely ERR/\u22a5 escapes or omitted token propagation pairs) so the rule tables can be patched."
