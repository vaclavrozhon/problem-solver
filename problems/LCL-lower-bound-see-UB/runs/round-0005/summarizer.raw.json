Outer seams enforce mirroring/pointer-exposure and offer gating; central seam (B=2) has an explicit allowed-pair table (Idle, EqStart, EqL[b]/EqR[b], NeqStart, NeqPick[b]/NeqCheck[b], CAP/PAD) synchronizing phases but leaving bit-tests to local pointer-integrity lanes. Pointer-integrity uses Address–RIDbit–Return triads and comparator tiles; Selected=1 activates exactly one clause bundle, with any inconsistency triggering a 1–2 step error-chain that flips Role→Neutral. The Barrier Lemma places Bar nodes adjacent to each block footer so only nearest blocks can participate in a certificate; this enforces (F2) automatically (no ⊥-plumbing). Exclusivity (E′) follows: RID=ip enables (CAP,CAP) only, RID≠ip enables (PAD,PAD) only. Alphabet size remains poly(s)+O(B) = poly(s).
