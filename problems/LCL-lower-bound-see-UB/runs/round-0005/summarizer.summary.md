Round 0005 delivered DP-checkable, radius-1 rule schemas that complete the S3Col→FFE(F1) reduction skeleton. Main building blocks: deterministic per-bit probes (Start/Head/Test/Accept + contiguous PORT) that separate 2^B types; per-side gating with directional tokens Tok→/Tok← that are seeded only for canonical colored sides and propagate monotonically so RUN/VERD activate only in active–active pairs; a one-cell VERD(e,q,cFwd) next to S2 whose allowed S2↔VERD pairs simultaneously enforce EDGE and Eq (with D(u,u)=0 to avoid contradictions); a bridging design that confines all constraints to a constant-width corridor so (F2) is vacuous/z-invariant; and a radius-1 padding lemma that guarantees canonical contexts at lengths ℓ_pump or ℓ_pump+1. A concrete B=2 skeleton (≈45 symbols, O(10^2) adjacency pairs) and a DP audit checklist (16 seam cases + 4 probe seeds) were supplied. Verifier: “partial success.”
