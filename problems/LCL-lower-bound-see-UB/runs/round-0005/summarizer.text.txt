  "summary_md": "This round fixes the verifier’s two seam inconsistencies by splitting each S-node into S1 (variable side) and S2 (clause side) with separate choice and phase subtracks, adding offer bits and read-only lbit/rbit mirrors, and specifying Selected (sgnsel) wiring. Outer seams enforce mirroring/pointer-exposure and offer gating; central seam (B=2) has an explicit allowed-pair table (Idle, EqStart, EqL[b]/EqR[b], NeqStart, NeqPick[b]/NeqCheck[b], CAP/PAD) synchronizing phases but leaving bit-tests to local pointer-integrity lanes. Pointer-integrity uses Address–RIDbit–Return triads and comparator tiles; Selected=1 activates exactly one clause bundle, with any inconsistency triggering a 1–2 step error-chain that flips Role→Neutral. The Barrier Lemma places Bar nodes adjacent to each block footer so only nearest blocks can participate in a certificate; this enforces (F2) automatically (no ⊥-plumbing). Exclusivity (E′) follows: RID=ip enables (CAP,CAP) only, RID≠ip enables (PAD,PAD) only. Alphabet size remains poly(s)+O(B) = poly(s). Citations: prover-01.out.json (progress_md).",

    "Provide the explicit pointer-lane tile list (Address–RIDbit–Return tiles) and the 1–2 step error-chain transitions that flip Role●→Neutral● for formal completeness.",
    "Expand the B=2 central-seam schema into the concrete out–out pair list (12–16 explicit pairs) the verifier can check by hand and supply a micro-count of |Σout| with chosen parameters c0,c1.",
    "Update the hardness writeup: replace Section B.6's ⊥-based (F2) with the Barrier Lemma and add the formal short proof that repeats cannot influence a seam certificate beyond nearest blocks."
