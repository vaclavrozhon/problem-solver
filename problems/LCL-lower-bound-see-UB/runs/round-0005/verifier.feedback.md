Strong progress this round: all four reports converge on the same high-level gadgetry (per‑bit boundary probes for type separation, per‑side color gating, directional tokens for seam activation, and a local verdict cell enforcing EDGE/Eq). The symbol budgets and DP-auditable B=2 plan are sound. However, there are a few critical locality/consistency issues to fix before we can promote anything into output.md.

What looks correct and valuable
- Per‑bit probe (TS): The deterministic, radius‑1 pipeline seeded by reserved boundary outputs Q_j, with Cin–out tying RIDbit to the input and PORT contiguity enforcing a unique scan, is coherent. If you forbid ERR/⊥ adjacency to probe states and list unique successors, then E_{L(u)}(a⋆)[Q_j] = u_j holds. This is a good core lemma once a concrete B=2 instance passes DP.
- Per‑side gating: Restricting S to {R,G,B} only when the immediate interior neighbor is the canonical gate token (GateL/GateR) and otherwise forcing S=⊥ is the right way to keep mixed pairs vacuous.
- Verdict adjacency (EDGE/Eq): Enumerating allowed S2↔VERD pairs to enforce simultaneously “EDGE=1 ⇒ colors differ” and “Eq=1 ⇒ colors equal,” and disallowing the (1,1) case (since we can pre‑arrange D(u,u)=0) is clean and local.

Critical issues to fix
1) Token propagation and mixed pairs (Prover 02 bug): For two corridor cells, listing only (Corr_10→Corr_11) and omitting (Corr_10→Corr_10) forces a spurious Tok←=1 on the right corridor cell even when the right side is non‑canonical. That breaks mixed pairs (canonical left only) by forcing VERD/must‑color on the right. Correct rule: along the corridor, bits must never spontaneously increase except from their own seeding end. Concretely, for a left→right corridor edge (x,y) allow only pairs with y.Tok→ ≥ x.Tok→ and y.Tok← ≤ x.Tok← (equivalently: Tok→ nondecreasing left→right; Tok← nondecreasing right→left). Do not hardwire Corr_10→Corr_11.
2) Token propagation direction (Prover 04 inconsistency): The bullet that listed all four “bits constant across edges” pairs prevents tokens from ever meeting; the alternative bullet that made both bits nondecreasing left→right is also incorrect for Tok←. Use the asymmetric monotonicity above so that Tok→ flows right, Tok← flows left; then Corr_11 appears in active‑active only.
3) Must‑color trigger: It must depend on the opposite‑direction token only (at S1 use Tok← at the S1‑adjacent corridor cell; at S2 use Tok→ at the S2‑adjacent corridor cell). Some text (Prover 02) would force S2 to color when Tok→=1 in mixed pairs; that is wrong. In mixed pairs, one side sees the opposite bit 0 and must permit S=⊥ and neutral PAD attachment.
4) Seeding discipline: Ensure tokens are forced at the corridor cell adjacent to S iff that side is canonical and S is colored; otherwise force 0. Do not allow any symbol with a 1‑bit token to appear adjacent to S on a noncanonical side.
5) Orientation of the right PORT zone: Keep it consistent (e.g., left side P1→P2 abutting S1; right side abutting S2 with P2 then P1 as you go leftwards). Ensure probe‑head marching and (for B=2) the Ver(u,v) reading is aligned with this orientation.
6) Tying VERD(e,q) to u,v in B=2: Your plans are fine (either expand Corr/Ver to encode (u,v) or constrain local neighborhoods so only the correct Ver(e,q) appears). But please actually enumerate the 16 (u,v) cases into radius‑1 pairs; without this, the DP may fabricate a wrong VERD.
7) Probe mode exclusivity: Make sure no PROBE state can appear unless injected by Q_j; list no pairs from PAD/PORT^I into PROBE; use distinct PORT variants (idle vs probe‑active) if needed.
8) Referencing missing lemmas: Several notes cite “Lemmas 11–15” for padding; these are not in output.md. Keep this in notes only for now. If you add a specialized padding lemma, make it self‑contained (radius‑1, PAD‑only pumping outside the seam).

Next steps (concrete and auditable)
- Unify token rules across provers to the asymmetric monotonicity: for the left→right corridor edge (x,y) require y.Tok→ ≥ x.Tok→ and y.Tok← ≤ x.Tok←. Seed Tok→=1 at S1 only if GateL and S1∈{R,G,B}; seed Tok←=1 at S2 only if GateR and S2∈{R,G,B}. Opposite‑token=1 at the neighbor triggers must‑color and forbids neutral PAD there; otherwise allow S=⊥ and PAD.
- Produce the full B=2 machine‑readable instance: symbol list; Cin–out (PORT bit‑tying); Cout–out for probes (deterministic), PORT contiguity, gating, tokens (seeding + asymmetric propagation), must‑color rules, S2↔VERD table, and the 16‑case wiring for (u,v)→(EDGE,Eq). Include ERR discipline (no ERR adjacent to PROBE/RUN/VERD in active modes).
- Run the DP checks: (i) TS for Q_1,Q_2; (ii) 16 ordered pairs (u,v) under a toy D (e.g., 4‑cycle) verifying active‑active acceptance iff [(edge ⇒ colors differ) ∧ (u=v ⇒ colors equal)] and mixed pairs accept unconditionally; (iii) confirm no ERR/⊥ escape in probe/active modes.
- After DP validation, promote TS (probe), RG (gating+tokens), and SG (seam verdict) as formal lemmas into output.md with clean statements and proofs.
- Add a short, radius‑1 padding lemma specialized to our PAD role (or keep it in notes if you prefer to avoid adding family‑specific facts to output.md).
