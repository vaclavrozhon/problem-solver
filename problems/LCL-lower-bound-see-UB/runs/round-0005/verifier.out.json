  "feedback_md": "Strong progress this round: all four reports converge on the same high-level gadgetry (per\u2011bit boundary probes for type separation, per\u2011side color gating, directional tokens for seam activation, and a local verdict cell enforcing EDGE/Eq). The symbol budgets and DP-auditable B=2 plan are sound. However, there are a few critical locality/consistency issues to fix before we can promote anything into output.md.\n\nWhat looks correct and valuable\n- Per\u2011bit probe (TS): The deterministic, radius\u20111 pipeline seeded by reserved boundary outputs Q_j, with Cin\u2013out tying RIDbit to the input and PORT contiguity enforcing a unique scan, is coherent. If you forbid ERR/\u22a5 adjacency to probe states and list unique successors, then E_{L(u)}(a\u22c6)[Q_j] = u_j holds. This is a good core lemma once a concrete B=2 instance passes DP.\n- Per\u2011side gating: Restricting S to {R,G,B} only when the immediate interior neighbor is the canonical gate token (GateL/GateR) and otherwise forcing S=\u22a5 is the right way to keep mixed pairs vacuous.\n- Verdict adjacency (EDGE/Eq): Enumerating allowed S2\u2194VERD pairs to enforce simultaneously \u201cEDGE=1 \u21d2 colors differ\u201d and \u201cEq=1 \u21d2 colors equal,\u201d and disallowing the (1,1) case (since we can pre\u2011arrange D(u,u)=0) is clean and local.\n\nCritical issues to fix\n1) Token propagation and mixed pairs (Prover 02 bug): For two corridor cells, listing only (Corr_10\u2192Corr_11) and omitting (Corr_10\u2192Corr_10) forces a spurious Tok\u2190=1 on the right corridor cell even when the right side is non\u2011canonical. That breaks mixed pairs (canonical left only) by forcing VERD/must\u2011color on the right. Correct rule: along the corridor, bits must never spontaneously increase except from their own seeding end. Concretely, for a left\u2192right corridor edge (x,y) allow only pairs with y.Tok\u2192 \u2265 x.Tok\u2192 and y.Tok\u2190 \u2264 x.Tok\u2190 (equivalently: Tok\u2192 nondecreasing left\u2192right; Tok\u2190 nondecreasing right\u2192left). Do not hardwire Corr_10\u2192Corr_11.\n2) Token propagation direction (Prover 04 inconsistency): The bullet that listed all four \u201cbits constant across edges\u201d pairs prevents tokens from ever meeting; the alternative bullet that made both bits nondecreasing left\u2192right is also incorrect for Tok\u2190. Use the asymmetric monotonicity above so that Tok\u2192 flows right, Tok\u2190 flows left; then Corr_11 appears in active\u2011active only.\n3) Must\u2011color trigger: It must depend on the opposite\u2011direction token only (at S1 use Tok\u2190 at the S1\u2011adjacent corridor cell; at S2 use Tok\u2192 at the S2\u2011adjacent corridor cell). Some text (Prover 02) would force S2 to color when Tok\u2192=1 in mixed pairs; that is wrong. In mixed pairs, one side sees the opposite bit 0 and must permit S=\u22a5 and neutral PAD attachment.\n4) Seeding discipline: Ensure tokens are forced at the corridor cell adjacent to S iff that side is canonical and S is colored; otherwise force 0. Do not allow any symbol with a 1\u2011bit token to appear adjacent to S on a noncanonical side.\n5) Orientation of the right PORT zone: Keep it consistent (e.g., left side P1\u2192P2 abutting S1; right side abutting S2 with P2 then P1 as you go leftwards). Ensure probe\u2011head marching and (for B=2) the Ver(u,v) reading is aligned with this orientation.\n6) Tying VERD(e,q) to u,v in B=2: Your plans are fine (either expand Corr/Ver to encode (u,v) or constrain local neighborhoods so only the correct Ver(e,q) appears). But please actually enumerate the 16 (u,v) cases into radius\u20111 pairs; without this, the DP may fabricate a wrong VERD.\n7) Probe mode exclusivity: Make sure no PROBE state can appear unless injected by Q_j; list no pairs from PAD/PORT^I into PROBE; use distinct PORT variants (idle vs probe\u2011active) if needed.\n8) Referencing missing lemmas: Several notes cite \u201cLemmas 11\u201315\u201d for padding; these are not in output.md. Keep this in notes only for now. If you add a specialized padding lemma, make it self\u2011contained (radius\u20111, PAD\u2011only pumping outside the seam).\n\nNext steps (concrete and auditable)\n- Unify token rules across provers to the asymmetric monotonicity: for the left\u2192right corridor edge (x,y) require y.Tok\u2192 \u2265 x.Tok\u2192 and y.Tok\u2190 \u2264 x.Tok\u2190. Seed Tok\u2192=1 at S1 only if GateL and S1\u2208{R,G,B}; seed Tok\u2190=1 at S2 only if GateR and S2\u2208{R,G,B}. Opposite\u2011token=1 at the neighbor triggers must\u2011color and forbids neutral PAD there; otherwise allow S=\u22a5 and PAD.\n- Produce the full B=2 machine\u2011readable instance: symbol list; Cin\u2013out (PORT bit\u2011tying); Cout\u2013out for probes (deterministic), PORT contiguity, gating, tokens (seeding + asymmetric propagation), must\u2011color rules, S2\u2194VERD table, and the 16\u2011case wiring for (u,v)\u2192(EDGE,Eq). Include ERR discipline (no ERR adjacent to PROBE/RUN/VERD in active modes).\n- Run the DP checks: (i) TS for Q_1,Q_2; (ii) 16 ordered pairs (u,v) under a toy D (e.g., 4\u2011cycle) verifying active\u2011active acceptance iff [(edge \u21d2 colors differ) \u2227 (u=v \u21d2 colors equal)] and mixed pairs accept unconditionally; (iii) confirm no ERR/\u22a5 escape in probe/active modes.\n- After DP validation, promote TS (probe), RG (gating+tokens), and SG (seam verdict) as formal lemmas into output.md with clean statements and proofs.\n- Add a short, radius\u20111 padding lemma specialized to our PAD role (or keep it in notes if you prefer to avoid adding family\u2011specific facts to output.md).\n",
  "new_notes_md": "Directional-token seam activation: corrected local rules and B=2 checklist (radius 1)\n\nCorrect token seeding and propagation (two-cell corridor)\n- Corridor cells: CL (immediately right of S1) and CR (immediately left of S2). Each carries two token bits (t\u2192, t\u2190) \u2208 {0,1}^2.\n- Seeding at S:\n  \u2022 At S1\u2013CL: If the interior neighbor is GateL and S1 \u2208 {R,G,B}, force CL.t\u2192=1 and CL.t\u2190=0; otherwise force CL=(0,0).\n  \u2022 At S2\u2013CR: If the interior neighbor is GateR and S2 \u2208 {R,G,B}, force CR.t\u2190=1 and CR.t\u2192=0; otherwise force CR=(0,0).\n- Asymmetric propagation across the corridor (left\u2192right edge CL\u2192CR): allowed iff CR.t\u2192 \u2265 CL.t\u2192 and CR.t\u2190 \u2264 CL.t\u2190. Equivalently: Tok\u2192 is nondecreasing left\u2192right; Tok\u2190 is nondecreasing right\u2192left. No 0\u21921 increase is possible except from its own seeding side. Outside the corridor, no symbol with a 1\u2011bit token is permitted.\n- Consequences:\n  \u2022 Mixed pairs (exactly one canonical/colored side): CL or CR may be (1,0) on the canonical side; the opposite cell remains (0,0). No Corr_11 appears; RUN/VERD remain absent.\n  \u2022 Active\u2013active (both sides canonical/colored): CL seeds (1,0), CR seeds (0,1); propagation yields CR=(1,1) and CL=(1,1) as needed; RUN is enabled and VERD must appear at CR.\n\nMust\u2011color and fallback (local at S)\n- The must\u2011color trigger uses the opposite\u2011direction token bit only:\n  \u2022 At S1: if CL.t\u2190 = 1, forbid S1=\u22a5 and forbid attaching to neutral PAD; require the designated FWD neighbor (color forwarder).

If CR.t\u2192 = 0, allow S2=\u22a5 and neutral PAD.\n- This guarantees: mixed pairs accept unconditionally (colored on the canonical side; \u22a5 on the noncanonical side). Active\u2013active pairs must color and run the verdict.\n\nPer\u2011bit probe (TS) recap and requirements\n- Reserve B boundary 4\u2011tuples {Q_j}. Under Q_j and fixed boundary inputs a\u22c6, a deterministic pipeline Start_j\u2192Head_j marches to the unique PORT cell with Addr=j and accepts iff RIDbit=1. While PROBE states are present: no ERR/\u22a5 adjacency and unique successors only. PORT contiguity enforces a contiguous block Addr=1,\u2026,B abutting S.\n- DP\u2011checkable claim: For canonical L(u), E_{L(u)}(a\u22c6)[Q_j] = u_j.

Verify that mixed pairs accept unconditionally (canonical side colored; opposite side \u22a5).\n\nClarifications to remember\n- Types are defined w.r.t. fixed interior inputs; Cin\u2013out ties PORT.RIDbit to those inputs. \n- Context set C (used in upper bounds and in our bookkeeping) can be taken as the set of types realized by w_1 S w_2 with |w_i| \u2208 {\u2113_pump, \u2113_pump+1}; hence |C| \u2264 \u2113_pump. We have not yet added a padding lemma to output.md; keep padding arguments here until a self\u2011contained lemma is written.\n",
