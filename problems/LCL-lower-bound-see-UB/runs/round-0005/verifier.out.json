  "feedback_md": "High-value progress: splitting the S-node into a product palette (choice vs phase subtracks) and making the outer seams constrain only choices while the central seam gates phases is the right structural move. The both-sides-offer gating, explicit Selected\u2194RUN wiring on the clause side, and the barrier placement immediately past the RUN footer are all aligned with the previous verifier guidance. The alphabet-size estimate is also reasonable (O(B)+poly(s) with B polynomial in s). The B=2 walkthrough and the \u201ccentral seam table schema\u201d are helpful for concreteness.\n\nHowever, there is a critical correctness gap: the proposed design no longer compares the variable bit and the selected occurrence bit across the seam. As written, EqL[b]/EqR[b] loops only check agreement between a block\u2019s own bit-lane and its mirrored copy on S (trivially true by mirroring), and the NeqCheckL/R[b] relies on block-internal \u201cMismatch\u201d flags that cannot be computed using only one side\u2019s local information. A block cannot infer a cross-side mismatch without seeing the other side\u2019s bit, and the seam pair table currently \u201conly synchronizes phases,\u201d so neither Eq nor Neq actually enforces cross-side equality/inequality. This invalidates the Exclusivity E\u2032 argument and the B=2 DP trace.\n\nFix required: move the cross-side bit tests to the central seam. For each b, the central seam pair (EqL[b],EqR[b]) must be allowed only if lbit[b]=rbit[b], and (NeqCheckL[b],NeqCheckR[b]) only if lbit[b]\u2260rbit[b]. This does not cause blow-up: per b there are only four bit combinations; you allow two for Eq and two for Neq. The \u201cdone\u201d/\u201cfound-mismatch\u201d marks can still be used to track progress, but the decisive test must be at the central seam where both mirrored bits are simultaneously visible.\n\nBarrier semantics currently conflict: one bullet says barriers \u201callow only PAD-plumbing of the block-internal language,\u201d while the next says barriers \u201cforbid all cursor/terminal phases (\u2026 CAP/PAD).\u201d Please unify to a single rule: across any edge incident to a barrier node, no certificate/cursor/terminal substate is allowed; only neutral/block-internal non-certificate symbols may appear. In addition, at the outer seam, if the neighbor is Bar\u2022, force S\u2022.choice=\u22a5 and S\u2022.phase=Neutral and offer\u2022=0. This is sufficient (and necessary) for the F2 argument.\n\nSmaller points to clean up:\n- Idle alignment must also require offerL=offerR=1 (you already state this, keep it explicit in the final table).\n- The \u201cerror-chain starter\u201d that deactivates miswired Selected/HotRID should be specified to complete within \u22642 hops and should monotonically force the neighboring Role to Neutral\u2022, which in turn forces S\u2022.choice=\u22a5 by the outer seam; ensure no transient non-neutral S-phase survives when an offer bit is 0.\n- Revisit the B=2 ON/OFF trace after fixing the central seam comparators; currently it assumes cross-side equality/inequality is actually checked.\n- Clarify that S is one node whose state has both subtracks; the \u201ccentral seam table\u201d is an internal consistency table between subtracks of the same node (or equivalently an internal edge in a radius-1 encoding). This avoids the \u201ctwo S nodes\u201d reading.\n- Microcount: with central seam comparators, the number of central pairs is O(1)+O(B) (Idle, starts, 2B Eq-steps, 2B Neq-steps, and 2 terminals), still polynomial.\n\nConcrete next steps for provers:\n1) Write the exact B=2 central seam table with bit comparators: for each b\u2208{0,1}, allow (EqL[b],EqR[b]) iff lbit[b]=rbit[b], and (NeqCheckL[b],NeqCheckR[b]) iff lbit[b]\u2260rbit[b]; forbid all Eq/Neq mixing; CAP only after all Eq steps; PAD only after some NeqCheck. Include the sign gate at CAP.\n2) Unify barrier rules as above, and give the 1-step outer-seam rule enforcing S\u2022.choice=\u22a5 and S\u2022.phase=Neutral when Role\u2022=Bar\u2022.\n3) Spell out the 2-step error-chain for Selected wiring and for HotRID\u2192RIDbits/one-hot consistency, and show that any inconsistency deactivates the interface locally and prevents non-neutral S-phases via the offer bits.\n4) Re-run the B=2 DP trace (ON and OFF) using the corrected central-seam comparators.\n5) Provide the explicit alphabet microcount incorporating the per-b phase states and the comparator conditions.\nWith these fixes, the Exclusivity E\u2032 proof becomes correct and short, and the barrier-based F2 argument is valid without resorting to \u22a5 padding on repeats.",

No other Eq pair is allowed for that b.\n  - Inequality check for b: allow (NeqCheckL[b],NeqCheckR[b]) iff lbit[b]\u2260rbit[b]. No other NeqCheck pair is allowed for that b.\n  - Terminals: allow (CAP,CAP) only if all equality steps for b=0,\u2026,B\u22121 have occurred (as evidenced by per-b \u201cdone\u201d marks on the cursor lanes) and the sign gate holds: (S1.truth=VT \u2227 sgnsel=+) \u2228 (S1.truth=VF \u2227 sgnsel=\u2212).

Only neutral/non-certificate block-internal symbols may appear.\n- Consequence: only the two nearest blocks (adjacent to S) can participate in any Eq/Neq certificate; repeats beyond are inert with respect to S. This yields the F2 independence of z (see outputs for a formal lemma).\n\nSign and selection\n- We adopt occurrence-only S2.occ and read sign from RUN via sgnsel. The CAP sign gate is checked purely at the central seam using sgnsel and S1.truth; PAD ignores sign.\n\nB=2 trace after CSC (to be supplied explicitly next)\n- ON: RID=10, choose O2 with ip=10 and sgn2=\u2212, set S1.truth=VF. Idle\u2192EqStart\u2192EqL/R[0] (lbit0=rbit0=0)\u2192EqL/R[1] (lbit1=rbit1=1)\u2192CAP; CAP passes the sign gate (VF with \u2212).\n- OFF: same clause, choose O1 with ip=01. lbit\u2260rbit at b=0 (and at b=1). Eq stalls at first mismatch; NeqStart\u2192NeqCheck[0] allowed (since lbit0\u2260rbit0)\u2192PAD.\n\nAction items (for provers)\n- Enumerate the exact central seam table for B=2 under CSC, including Idle, EqStart, EqL/R[0], EqL/R[1], CAP, NeqStart, NeqPick[0/1] (if kept), NeqCheckL/R[0/1], PAD, and the sign gate.\n- List the 2-step error-chain tiles for Selected wiring and HotRID/RIDbits one-hot consistency; prove they force Role\u2022\u2192Neutral\u2022 locally and therefore S\u2022.choice=\u22a5 and phase=Neutral via the outer seam.\n- Provide the alphabet-size microcount with per-b phase states included; confirm |\u03a3out|=poly(s).\n- Re-run the B=2 DP simulation with CSC in place; include explicit pair tables so the check is mechanical.\n",

  "new_outputs_md": "Lemma (Barrier-based invariance of repeats, i.e., F2 under unified barriers and offer gating).\nAssume the following local rules for a radius-1 system with a seam node S flanked by a left block and a right block:\n1) Outer-seam deactivation by barriers: If the left (resp. right) seam-adjacent interior node is a barrier BarVar (resp. BarCla), then at the corresponding outer seam S requires S1.truth=\u22a5, S1.phase=Neutral, offerL=0 (resp. S2.occ=\u22a5, S2.phase=Neutral, offerR=0).\n2) Barrier edges forbid certificates: Along any edge incident to a barrier node, no certificate or terminal substate is permitted (i.e., none of EqStart/EqL[b]/EqR[b]/NeqStart/NeqPick[b]/NeqCheckL[b]/NeqCheckR[b]/CAP/PAD may appear).\n3) Central seam start gating: Any non-neutral central-seam pair (Idle, EqStart, NeqStart, EqL/R[b], NeqCheckL/R[b], CAP, PAD) is allowed only if offerL=offerR=1 and S1.truth\u2260\u22a5, S2.occ\u2260\u22a5.\nThen, for any word w and any z\u22651 repeats of the interior blocks beyond the two blocks adjacent to S, the existence of a global labeling realizing a central terminal (CAP,CAP) or (PAD,PAD) depends only on the two nearest blocks. In particular, if a labeling exists for z=1, one exists for all z\u22651; if none exists for z=1, none exists for any z\u22651.\nProof.\nUnder (1)\u2013(2), all certificate/cursor activity is confined to the two nearest blocks: barriers force the outer seam offers to 0 if present and forbid any certificate token to cross a barrier edge. Under (3), the central seam can leave Neutral only if both nearest blocks are active (offerL=offerR=1) and S choices are non-\u22a5. Hence any successful terminal at S must be witnessed entirely within the two nearest blocks, independent of farther repeats. If there is a labeling for z=1, extend it to any z\u22651 by repeating the inert barrier-protected interiors; all local constraints remain satisfied and the central seam labeling is unchanged. Conversely, if no labeling exists for z=1, then adding repetitions only introduces more barrier-protected interiors that cannot create offers or cursors at S; thus the central seam remains unable to realize a terminal for any z\u22651. \u220e\n\nLemma (No-\u22a5 at S on active seams).\nAssume the outer seam rules: if RoleL=AccVar then S1.truth\u2208{VT,VF} and offerL=1; otherwise S1.truth=\u22a5 and S1.phase=Neutral and offerL=0; symmetrically for the right side. Then whenever the left (resp. right) neighbor is active (RoleL=AccVar, resp. RoleR=AccCla), the S choice on that side cannot be \u22a5, and any central-seam non-neutral pair that requires offerL=offerR=1 necessarily occurs with non-\u22a5 choices on both sides. In particular, activation preserves (F1) nontriviality by forbidding \u22a5 at S on active contexts.\nProof.\nImmediate from the outer-seam constraints: when Role\u2022=Acc\u2022, the only allowed outer-seam pairings force S\u2022.choice\u2208{VT,VF} (resp. {O1,O2,O3}) and offer\u2022=1; the cases with S\u2022.choice=\u22a5 or offer\u2022=0 are disallowed. Since the central seam non-neutral pairs require offerL=offerR=1, they can only occur when both choices are non-\u22a5. \u220e",
