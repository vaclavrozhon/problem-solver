--- SYSTEM ---
You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md and outputs.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers
- notes.md (summary so far)
- outputs.md (rigorously proven results so far)

Guidelines:
- notes.md: should be a readable running log of interesting work. Prefer appending. Replace only if old notes are clearly misleading. Remember -- notes should be self-contained and should make sense even without seeing outputs of past provers. 
- outputs.md: should be concise and rigorous. Keep only proven theorems with clear proofs. If a statement is flawed and you cannot fix it, remove it from outputs.md and instead add it to notes.md with explanation.
- Be careful with the booleans `new_notes_append` and `new_outputs_append`: default is True (append). Use False only when deliberately rewriting everything.

Tasks:
1) Audit rigor: identify unjustified steps, false statements, missing lemmas; produce minimal counterexamples.
2) Triage value: separate genuine progress from noise.
3) Guide next steps: propose what provers should try next.

[{"prover_id": "01", "progress_md": "Status and plan\n- We address the verifier\u2019s two critical seam inconsistencies by splitting each S-node into choice and phase subtracks and rewriting all three seams accordingly. We also pin down mirroring/pointer-integrity and Selected\u2194RUN wiring, clarify barriers and why they make (F2) automatic without using \u22a5 on repeats, and give B=2 central-seam pair tables (Idle/Eq/Neq/CAP/PAD) to make Exclusivity explicit. Finally we provide an alphabet-size count and re-run the B=2 ON/OFF trace.\n- Note on outputs.md (LCL_classification.pdf): Section B.6 currently trivializes (F2) by allowing \u22a5-fill on wz. This is acceptable for NEXPTIME-hardness of classification in principle, but it was flagged as dangerous for (F1) nontriviality. We will instead enforce (F2) automatically via nearest-block barriers that cut certificates (see Barrier Lemma below); this keeps (F1) nontrivial and matches the verifier\u2019s preference.\n\nDefinitions: split palettes and subtracks at S\n- S1 (variable-side S): S1 = (truth, phase, offerL, lbit[0..B\u22121]).\n  - truth \u2208 {\u22a5, VT, VF}; phase \u2208 {Neutral, Idle, EqStart, EqL[b], NeqStart, NeqPick[b], NeqCheckL[b], CAP, PAD} with b \u2208 {0,..,B\u22121}; offerL \u2208 {0,1} copied from RoleL; lbit[b] are read-only bit mirrors (see mirroring rules) present only when RoleL=AccVar; undefined otherwise.\n- S2 (clause-side S): S2 = (occ, phase, offerR, rbit[0..B\u22121], sgnsel).\n  - occ \u2208 {\u22a5, O1, O2, O3}; phase \u2208 {Neutral, Idle, EqStart, EqR[b], NeqStart, NeqPick[b], NeqCheckR[b], CAP, PAD}; offerR \u2208 {0,1} copied from RoleR; rbit[b] are read-only mirrors of the selected occurrence\u2019s ip_bits[b]; sgnsel \u2208 {+,\u2212} is the selected sign (bound to occ via Selected wiring below).\n- Roles on seam-adjacent neighbors:\n  - Left neighbor RoleL \u2208 {AccVar, NeutralVar, BarVar}.\n  - Right neighbor RoleR \u2208 {AccCla, NeutralCla, BarCla}.\n\nOuter seams (radius-1) \u2014 explicit constraints\nLeft seam (L\u2192S1):\n- If RoleL=AccVar:\n  - Allowed: S1.truth \u2208 {VT,VF}; S1.phase \u2208 any of {Idle, EqStart, EqL[b], NeqStart, NeqPick[b], NeqCheckL[b], CAP, PAD}; S1.offerL=1;\n  - Mirroring: for each b, the pair (AccVar with RIDbits[b]=x, S1 with lbit[b]=x) is allowed; and (AccVar with RIDbits[b]=x, S1 with lbit[b]=1\u2212x) is forbidden. This ties S1.lbit[b] to RIDbits[b] locally.\n  - Pointer exposure: the AccVar interface exports PtrRID and the B bit-lanes immediately adjacent; equality/inequality cursors entering the block must follow the pointer lanes (see pointer-integrity below). We do not restrict S1.phase at the outer seam beyond barrier constraints.\n- If RoleL\u2208{NeutralVar, BarVar}:\n  - Allowed: only S1.truth=\u22a5, S1.phase=Neutral, S1.offerL=0; lbit[\u00b7] unconstrained (ignored). This deactivates the left seam locally.\nRight seam (S2\u2192R):\n- If RoleR=AccCla:\n  - Allowed: S2.occ \u2208 {O1,O2,O3}; S2.phase \u2208 any of {Idle, EqStart, EqR[b], NeqStart, NeqPick[b], NeqCheckR[b], CAP, PAD}; S2.offerR=1.\n  - Selected\u2194RUN wiring at the edge (enforced in the out\u2013out table): if S2.occ=Op then the pair is allowed only when (a) the clause RUN interface exposes the \u201cexport-ready\u201d tag for p, (b) rbit[b]=ip_bits_p[b] for all b, and (c) sgnsel=sgn[p]. Any mismatch has no legal pair except to an error-chain starter on the clause-side neighbor, which transitions RoleR\u2192NeutralCla within one local step (and thus forces S2.occ=\u22a5 by the above rule).\n- If RoleR\u2208{NeutralCla, BarCla}:\n  - Allowed: only S2.occ=\u22a5, S2.phase=Neutral, S2.offerR=0; rbit[\u00b7], sgnsel ignored.\n\nCentral seam (S1\u2192S2) \u2014 B=2 explicit pair tables\nWe list allowed central-seam pairs in the B=2 case (b \u2208 {0,1}); all unspecified pairs are forbidden.\n- Idle alignment:\n  - Allowed: (S1.phase=Idle, S2.phase=Idle) if S1.offerL=1, S2.offerR=1 and S1.truth\u2208{VT,VF}, S2.occ\u2208{O1,O2,O3}.\n- Starts (both-sides-offer gating):\n  - Allowed: (EqStart, EqStart) iff offerL=offerR=1 and S1.truth\u2260\u22a5, S2.occ\u2260\u22a5.\n  - Allowed: (NeqStart, NeqStart) under same gating.\n- Equality steps:\n  - (EqL[0], EqR[0]) allowed iff the left/right cursor lanes adjacent to S1/S2 carry the matching \u201cat-b=0\u201d cursor tokens; the actual bit-equality test is enforced inside blocks by pointer-integrity tiles (below); the central seam only synchronizes phases (see Remark 1).\n  - (EqL[1], EqR[1]) similarly.\n  - Terminal: (CAP,CAP) allowed iff both equality cursors have reached b=2 (checked by local \u201cdone\u201d marks shuttled back to S1/S2 along the cursor lanes) and the sign gate holds: (S1.truth=VT \u2227 sgnsel=+) \u2228 (S1.truth=VF \u2227 sgnsel=\u2212).\n- Inequality steps:\n  - (NeqPick[0], NeqPick[0]) and (NeqPick[1], NeqPick[1]) are allowed from (NeqStart,NeqStart) (nondeterministic b-choice) iff offerL=offerR=1.\n  - (NeqCheckL[0], NeqCheckR[0]) allowed iff the cursors at b=0 arrive from the block-side lanes with a local mismatch witness (enforced inside blocks; see below). Similarly for b=1.\n  - Terminal: (PAD,PAD) allowed iff a valid NeqCheckL/R[b] occurred and returned to the seam (checked by the \u201cfound-mismatch\u201d mark on both lanes at the seam). No other (PAD,PAD) is permitted.\n- Mutual exclusion:\n  - No pair mixes Eq and Neq phases, nor mixes CAP/PAD across sides, nor allows terminal pairs without the required \u201cdone/mismatch\u201d marks.\nRemark 1 (Where the bit tests live). The central seam pairs synchronize phases; bit comparisons are enforced by (a) mirroring (outer seams) to expose bit-lanes adjacent to S, (b) pointer-integrity and cursor-propagation tiles within the nearest-block nodes, which ensure that EqL[b]/EqR[b] cursors can reach the seam only if the corresponding bit-lane checks succeeded; this avoids any exponential blow-up in the out\u2013out tables at the central seam.\n\nPointer-integrity and Selected wiring (local, radius-1)\n- Variable side pointer lanes: The AccVar interface exports a fixed, constant-width \u201caddress corridor\u201d with B positions (b=0,1 for B=2 case), each consisting of a triad of nodes: Address[b] \u2013 RIDbit[b] \u2013 Return[b]. Cursor tiles enforce that EqL[b] can proceed from S1 to Address[b], then to RIDbit[b], then back via Return[b] to S1. At RIDbit[b], a comparator tile requires that the \u201cbit value\u201d subtrack seen equals the one mirrored to S1.lbit[b]; otherwise the cursor dies (no legal continuation). HotRID consistency (one-hot index equals binary RIDbits) is enforced in parallel by standard local tiles; any mismatch triggers an error-chain that flips RoleL to NeutralVar at that interface in \u22641 step.\n- Clause side pointer lanes: The AccCla interface similarly exports the three occurrence bundles; Selected wiring activates exactly one bundle according to S2.occ:\n  - If S2.occ=Op, a Selected=1 marker is present only on the p-th bundle; ip_bits_p[b] and sgn[p] flows through to the seam subtracks rbit[b], sgnsel via length-1 mirrors; the other bundles carry Selected=0 and are non-traversable by cursors (tiles for cursors require Selected=1 on their lane).\n  - If any two bundles claim Selected=1, or Selected=1 is present while S2.occ\u2260Op, or the RUN tableau row for p is inconsistent, the only allowed out\u2013out pairs are to an error-chain starter which locally deactivates the right interface (RoleR\u2192NeutralCla). This forbids spurious selection.\n- Inequality check tiles: At RIDbit[b] and ip_bits_p[b], dedicated tiles flip a local Mismatch flag iff the bits differ; the NeqCheckL/R[b] cursors can return to the seam only if the Mismatch flag was set on both sides for the same b; otherwise the cursor dies.\n\nBarrier lemma and (F2)\n- Placement: Each well-formed block ends with Footer followed immediately (one node closer to S) by Bar\u25cf \u2208 {BarVar,BarCla} on the seam-adjacent interior node beyond RUN. The block grammar enforces Footer\u2192Bar\u25cf within the block.\n- Barrier rules:\n  - On outer seams, Role\u25cf=Bar\u25cf forces S\u25cf.choice=\u22a5 and S\u25cf.phase=Neutral and S\u25cf.offer=0. Hence the central seam cannot enter any non-neutral phase if either side is Bar\u25cf (both-sides-offer gating fails).\n  - Along block-internal edges, barriers allow only PAD-plumbing of the block-internal language (not the central (PAD,PAD)) and forbid all cursor/terminal states (EqStart/EqL[b]/NeqStart/NeqPick/NeqCheck/CAP/PAD). Thus cursors cannot cross barriers.\n- Consequence: For any repeated context wz_1 S wz_2, only the nearest two blocks (the ones directly touching S) can participate in any certificate; extra repeats lie beyond barriers and are invisible to the seam. Therefore, the success/failure of the bridge does not depend on z. This makes (F2) hold automatically for our family without \u22a5-padding.\n- Short proof sketch: Suppose a labeling with CAP/PAD at the central seam for z=1 exists. For any z\u22652, repeat the nearest blocks; barriers ensure no cursor/phase can interact with farther copies, and the local seams inside repeats are block-internal and satisfiable by the block grammar. Conversely, if no labeling exists for z=1, adding repeating barriers cannot create a new central pair, as both-sides-offer and cursor arrivals are confined to nearest blocks; thus no z can succeed.\n\nExclusivity E\u2032 (radius-1, with the fixed tiles)\n- If RID = ip: For both b=0,1, equality cursors EqL[b]/EqR[b] can complete their left/right loops and return to the seam; the central seam admits (CAP,CAP) provided the sign gate (truth vs sgnsel) holds. Inequality cursors cannot set Mismatch on both sides for any b, hence cannot return with the required marks; (PAD,PAD) is forbidden.\n- If RID \u2260 ip: There exists b with RIDbit[b] \u2260 ip_bits[b]. The inequality cursors can set Mismatch and return, enabling (PAD,PAD); equality cursors stall at that b and cannot return a \u201cdone\u201d mark, so (CAP,CAP) is forbidden. Mutual exclusion follows from central-seam pairs.\n\nAlphabet-size count (\u03b2=poly(s))\n- Choice tracks: truth (3 symbols), occ (4 symbols).\n- Phase tracks on S: Neutral/Idle/EqStart/NeqStart/CAP/PAD = O(1) plus per-b cursors EqL[b], EqR[b], NeqPick[b], NeqCheckL[b], NeqCheckR[b] = O(B). Total S-phase alphabet O(B).\n- Role/Offer/Barrier bits and read-only mirrors: constant tracks plus B mirrored bits per side; values are per-node data but do not multiply the alphabet (the symbols encode bit values with 2 alternatives per lane); overall symbols O(B).\n- Block-internal tiles: pointer lanes and RUN tableau alphabets are poly(s) (U runs in BO(1) per row; Selected exposes ip/sign via constant-time local rules); error-chain alphabet is O(1\u00b7poly(s)).\n- Hence |\u03a3out| = \u03b2 = poly(s) + O(B) = poly(s) since B = s^{c0}.\n\nB=2 worked DP trace under corrected tables\n- ON case: RID=10, Clause j with occurrences (i1=01,+), (i2=10,\u2212), (i3=11,+). Choose S2.occ=O2; RUN exposes sgnsel=\u2212 and rbit[0]=0, rbit[1]=1 via Selected=1 on p=2; S1.truth=VF. Left/right interfaces are AccVar/AccCla so offerL=offerR=1; outer seams set lbit[0]=0, lbit[1]=1.\n  - Central seam Idle\u2192EqStart (both-sides-offer). Equality cursors at b=0,1 loop inside nearest blocks, find equal bits, and return \u201cdone\u201d marks. (CAP,CAP) passes sign gate since S1.truth=VF and sgnsel=\u2212. Bridge succeeds.\n- OFF case: same clause, select O1 (ip=01,+). lbit=(0,1) vs rbit=(1,0) differ at b=0 and b=1. Equality stalls (cannot return both \u201cdone\u201d marks). Inequality picks b=0 (or 1), sets Mismatch on both sides, returns, and (PAD,PAD) is accepted; sign is irrelevant for PAD. Bridge succeeds trivially for nonselected pairs; only the RID=ip pair would be constrained, and it indeed requires truth consistent with sign in the ON case.\n\nGaps closed vs verifier feedback\n- Static vs phase contradiction at S: resolved by subtrack split; outer seams constrain only choices and offers; central seam gates phase tokens.\n- \u201cIdle freeze\u201d vs certificate motion: S1.truth (resp. S2.occ) is frozen while S1/S2.phase hosts cursors; corrected tables reflect this.\n- Read-only mirroring and Selected wiring: specified as seam-local equalities with error-chain fallback; Selected=1 only on the chosen occurrence; any inconsistency locally deactivates the interface.\n- Barrier semantics: clarified\u2014barriers forbid all cursor/terminal phases and force choices=\u22a5, phase=Neutral; central (PAD,PAD) is not a barrier token.\n- Both-sides-offer gating: enforced by offer bits written at outer seams and required by all non-neutral central-seam pairs.\n\nWhat remains to formalize explicitly\n- Give the pointer-lane tiles (Address[b]\u2013RIDbit[b]\u2013Return[b], symmetry on clause side) and the exact error-chain transitions that flip Role\u25cf to Neutral\u25cf upon inconsistency; this is standard and local (\u22642 hops) but should be listed explicitly for completeness.\n- Expand the B=2 central-seam table into a small explicit list (we already listed the schema); we can supply the exact 12\u201316 pairs the verifier can check by hand.\n- Include a micro-count of \u03a3out symbols after adding the B-dependent cursor states in the concrete parameter choice c0, c1.\n\nWhy useful here\n- With these seam tables and barrier rules, (F1) encodes Succinct-3SAT robustly, sign is tied to RUN, and \u22a5 at S is forbidden on active seams. (F2) holds automatically by barriers (not by \u22a5-plumbing), avoiding the earlier pitfall.\n- The Exclusivity Lemma is now backed by explicit, radius-1 cursor lanes and central pair tables (B=2 shown; general B analogous), so exactly one of CAP/PAD can appear on active ordered pairs.\n\nNext steps\n- Write out the exact out\u2013out pairs for the B=2 central seam (Idle, EqStart, EqL[0], EqL[1], CAP; NeqStart, NeqPick[0/1], NeqCheck[0/1], PAD) and the corresponding outer-seam mirroring/selection pairs; include the 2\u2013step error-chain that deactivates miswired Selected.\n- Provide the pointer-integrity tile list (3 nodes per b per side suffice) and show any deviation is caught in \u22642 steps.\n- Update the hardness section to replace Section B.6\u2019s \u22a5-based (F2) with the barrier-based (F2) and include the Barrier Lemma.\n- Optional: include a small figure of the interface with Address[b]\u2013RIDbit[b]\u2013Return[b] lanes and barrier location.\n"}]

Verifier notes (2025-08-27):
- Adopt a hybrid: use Prover 02’s gate to separate ON (i∈vars(j)) from OFF pairs, and Prover 01’s window-anchored blocks to keep all semantics within wb/wc.
- Replace any O(1)-time checker with a poly(s)-length, radius-1 tableau inside wc (and wb as needed) that verifies C(j) and exposes the needed bits to the gate; ensure error-chain refutations for malformed headers.
- Do not rely on boundary-only signatures for type multiplicity; instead, separate types by differential boundary-extendibility induced by interior content (witness success/failure under fixed S-labels).
- Action items: (i) write explicit boundary tables (offers, gate, PAD/CAP conduits), (ii) specify the clause-verification tableau and its alphabet, (iii) prove type-separation and OFF/ON correctness, (iv) complete a B=2 worked example with DP simulation.
Verifier notes addendum (2025-08-27):
- Critical: Forbid ⊥ at S on active contexts. Adjust Cout–out so that when the window anchors a well-formed variable/clause block, the S palette excludes ⊥ and forces an offer; only inactive contexts allow ⊥. This preserves nontriviality of (F1).
- Adopt Prover 01’s occurrence-only S palette {O1,O2,O3}; read the sign from the verified RUN. If using sign-coded S tokens, add a local rule that forces the S-sign to equal the RUN’s sign for the selected occurrence.
- Gate exclusivity: Write and prove a radius-1 lemma that exactly one of equality/inequality certificates is realizable, with CAP allowed only under equality and PAD only under inequality.
- Type separation: Prefer a neutral tester j* (present as a type but labelable so it imposes no constraints under f) to guarantee distinct Var_i without relying on properties of C. Validate no side effects on (F1) or (F2).
- Proceed with explicit seam tables (offers, gate, CAP/PAD), the clause RUN tiles and error chains, and the B=2 worked DP table.
Verifier notes (addendum 2025-08-27, PM):
- Adopt two S-side palettes: S1 (variable side) ∈ {VT,VF,⊥}, S2 (clause side) ∈ {O1,O2,O3,⊥}. Forbid ⊥ at S1/S2 when the adjacent neighbor emits Offer; allow ⊥ only when the neighbor is Neutral/NoOffer.
- Prefer P02’s Offer/NoOffer seam grammar (CertStart, CAP/PAD conduits) and P01’s nearest-block barrier to make F2 automatic without trivializing F1. Barriers must stop all witness/cursor tokens and be placed exactly one node past RUN footers.
- Eq/Neq exclusivity: implement eq_so_far or per-bit comparator tiles with pointer-integrity tying HotRID↔RIDbits and Selected(ip)↔RUN. CAP only after full Eq; PAD only after Neq mismatch.
- Do not introduce a tester clause j* unless neutrality in F1 is proven. Aim to separate types via clauses from C or via internal extendibility masks.
- Activation-by-input (if used) must be radius-1: forward predecessor input locally or avoid using it.
- Action: write explicit seam tables; list barrier tokens/tiles; provide a B=2 DP walk for one ON and one OFF pair.
Seam and certificate design (2025-08-27, PM update)

Key corrections to the seam model
- The S nodes must carry a single static symbol visible on both edges. To allow certificates while still enforcing local activation, encode S1 and S2 as product palettes with subtracks:
  - S1.truth ∈ {⊥, VT, VF} and S1.phase ∈ {Neutral, Idle, EqStart, EqL[b], NeqStart, NeqCheckL[b], CAP, PAD, …}.
  - S2.occ ∈ {⊥, O1, O2, O3} and S2.phase ∈ {Neutral, Idle, EqStart, EqR[b], NeqStart, NeqCheckR[b], CAP, PAD, …}.
  The “choice” subtracks (truth/occ) are long-lived; the “phase” subtracks host cursors/certificates.
- Outer seams constrain only the choice subtracks and forbid non-neutral phases when inactive:
  - Left seam (L→S1): if RoleL=AccVar then S1.truth∈{VT,VF}; if RoleL∈{NeutralVar,BarVar} then S1.truth=⊥ and S1.phase=Neutral. No restriction on S1.phase when RoleL=AccVar beyond disallowing contradictions with barriers (see below).
  - Right seam (S2→R): symmetrical: AccCla forces S2.occ∈{O1,O2,O3}; Neutral/Bar forces S2.occ=⊥ and S2.phase=Neutral.
- Central seam gates phases and checks choices:
  - Idle alignment: allow only (S1.phase=Idle, S2.phase=Idle) paired with consistent (S1.truth,S2.occ) choices.
  - Start: allow (EqStart,EqStart) and (NeqStart,NeqStart) only if S1.truth≠⊥ and S2.occ≠⊥.
  - Cursors: allow (EqL[b],EqR[b]) iff the mirrored bit subtracks agree; allow (NeqCheckL[b],NeqCheckR[b]) iff the bits differ.
  - Terminals: allow (CAP,CAP) only after Eq reaches b=B and if sign gate holds: (S1.truth=VT and sgn[p]=+) or (S1.truth=VF and sgn[p]=−). Allow (PAD,PAD) only after a valid NeqCheck.

Mirroring and integrity
- Bit mirroring to S1/S2: For each b, enforce on the outer seams that S1.lbit[b]=RIDbits[b] (left) and S2.rbit[b]=ip_bits[b] (right). These S-local read-only subtracks are then visible to the central seam comparator.
- Selected pointer on the clause side: Introduce a subtrack Selected[b] that equals ip_bits[b] only when S2.occ=Op and the RUN-phase token for Op is present; otherwise trigger an error-chain that forces RoleR=NeutralCla, hence S2.occ=⊥ by the outer seam. This blocks spoofing of ip_bits or sign.

Barriers and F2
- Place BarVar/BarCla exactly one node past the RUN footer. Barriers impose: (i) Role•=Bar• forces outer seams to require S•.choice=⊥ and S•.phase=Neutral; (ii) forbid any cursor/terminal phases on the adjacent edges. Consequently, only the nearest blocks can participate in Eq/Neq certificates, and repeats beyond the nearest blocks do not affect the bridge outcome (F2).

Exclusivity E′ (sketch)
- Assuming correct mirroring and Selected wiring: if RID=ip, Eq advances to b=B and yields CAP; Neq has no b with mismatch and cannot place PAD. If RID≠ip, pick a mismatching b; Neq yields PAD; Eq stalls before CAP. CAP additionally requires sign compatibility with S1.truth.

B=2 worked example (to re-run after table fix)
- ON case: RID=10, pick O2 with sgn2=−, S1.truth=VF. With corrected outer seams (phase allowed when active), EqStart→EqL/R[0]=0 matches→EqL/R[1]=1 matches→CAP; CAP passes sign gate since VF with −.
- OFF case: RID=10, pick O1 with ip=01. Eq stalls at b=1; Neq picks b=1 and produces PAD; sign is irrelevant for PAD.

Open items
- Enumerate exact edge-pair tables for B=2 (left, central, right seams), including all cursor phases and the sign gate.
- List the Selected↔RUN and HotRID/RIDbits (if still used) tiles and the error-chain pairs that deactivate malformed blocks.
- Provide the alphabet-size count ensuring β=poly(s).
- Short proofs: (i) non-nearest seams forced Neutral by barriers in ≤1 step; (ii) both-sides-offer gating via central start and outer choice constraints.
