The symbol budgets and DP-auditable B=2 plan are sound. However, there are a few critical locality/consistency issues to fix before we can promote anything into output.md.\\n\\nWhat looks correct and valuable\\n- Per‑bit probe (TS): The deterministic, radius‑1 pipeline seeded by reserved boundary outputs Q_j, with Cin–out tying RIDbit to the input and PORT contiguity enforcing a unique scan, is coherent. If you forbid ERR/⊥ adjacency to probe states and list unique successors, then E_{L(u)}(a⋆)[Q_j] = u_j holds. This is a good core lemma once a concrete B=2 instance passes DP.\\n- Per‑side gating: Restricting S to {R,G,B} only when the immediate interior neighbor is the canonical gate token (GateL/GateR) and otherwise forcing S=⊥ is the right way to keep mixed pairs vacuous.\\n- Verdict adjacency (EDGE/Eq): Enumerating allowed S2↔VERD pairs to enforce simultaneously “EDGE=1 ⇒ colors differ” and “Eq=1 ⇒ colors equal,” and disallowing the (1,1) case (since we can pre‑arrange D(u,u)=0) is clean and local.\\n\\nCritical issues to fix\\n1) Token propagation and mixed pairs (Prover 02 bug): For two corridor cells, listing only (Corr_10→Corr_11) and omitting (Corr_10→Corr_10) forces a spurious Tok←=1 on the right corridor cell even when the right side is non‑canonical. That breaks mixed pairs (canonical left only) by forcing VERD/must‑color on the right. Correct rule: along the corridor, bits must never spontaneously increase except from their own seeding end. Concretely, for a left→right corridor edge (x,y) allow only pairs with y.Tok→ ≥ x.Tok→ and y.Tok← ≤ x.Tok← (equivalently: Tok→ nondecreasing left→right; Tok← nondecreasing right→left). Do not hardwire Corr_10→Corr_11.\\n2) Token propagation direction (Prover 04 inconsistency): The bullet that listed all four “bits constant across edges” pairs prevents tokens from ever meeting; the alternative bullet that made both bits nondecreasing left→right is also incorrect for Tok←. Use the asymmetric monotonicity above so that Tok→ flows right, Tok← flows left; then Corr_11 appears in active‑active only.\\n3) Must‑color trigger: It must depend on the opposite‑direction token only (at S1 use Tok← at the S1‑adjacent corridor cell; at S2 use Tok→ at the S2‑adjacent corridor cell). Some text (Prover 02) would force S2 to color when Tok→=1 in mixed pairs; that is wrong. In mixed pairs, one side sees the opposite bit 0 and must permit S=⊥ and neutral PAD attachment.\\n4) Seeding discipline: Ensure tokens are forced at the corridor cell adjacent to S iff that side is canonical and S is colored; otherwise force 0. Do not allow any symbol with a 1‑bit token to appear adjacent to S on a noncanonical side.\\n5) Orientation of the right PORT zone: Keep it consistent (e.g., left side P1→P2 abutting S1; right side abutting S2 with P2 then P1 as you go leftwards). Ensure probe‑head marching and (for B=2) the Ver(u,v) reading is aligned with this orientation.\\n6) Tying VERD(e,q) to u,v in B=2: Your plans are fine (either expand Corr/Ver to encode (u,v) or constrain local neighborhoods so only the correct Ver(e,q) appears). But please actually enumerate the 16 (u,v) cases into radius‑1 pairs; without this, the DP may fabricate a wrong VERD.\\n7) Probe mode exclusivity: Make sure no PROBE state can appear unless injected by Q_j; list no pairs from PAD/PORT^I into PROBE; use distinct PORT variants (idle vs probe‑active) if needed.\\n8) Referencing missing lemmas: Several notes cite “Lemmas 11–15” for padding; these are not in output.md. Keep this in notes only for now. If you add a specialized padding lemma, make it self‑contained (radius‑1, PAD‑only pumping outside the seam).\\n\\nNext steps (concrete and auditable)\\n- Unify token rules across provers to the asymmetric monotonicity: for the left→right corridor edge (x,y) require y.Tok→ ≥ x.Tok→ and y.Tok← ≤ x.Tok←. Seed Tok→=1 at S1 only if GateL and S1∈{R,G,B}; seed Tok←=1 at S2 only if GateR and S2∈{R,G,B}. Opposite‑token=1 at the neighbor triggers must‑color and forbids neutral PAD there; otherwise allow S=⊥ and PAD.\\n- Produce the full B=2 machine‑readable instance: symbol list; Cin–out (PORT bit‑tying); Cout–out for probes (deterministic), PORT contiguity, gating, tokens (seeding + asymmetric propagation), must‑color rules, S2↔VERD table, and the 16‑case wiring for (u,v)→(EDGE,Eq). Include ERR discipline (no ERR adjacent to PROBE/RUN/VERD in active modes).\\n- Run the DP checks: (i) TS for Q_1,Q_2; (ii) 16 ordered pairs (u,v) under a toy D (e.g., 4‑cycle) verifying active‑active acceptance iff [(edge ⇒ colors differ) ∧ (u=v ⇒ colors equal)] and mixed pairs accept unconditionally; (iii) confirm no ERR/⊥ escape in probe/active modes.\\n- After DP validation, promote TS (probe), RG (gating+tokens), and SG (seam verdict) as formal lemmas into output.md with clean statements and proofs.\\n- Add a short, radius‑1 padding lemma specialized to our PAD role (or keep it in notes if you prefer to avoid adding family‑specific facts to output.md).\\n\",\"new_notes_md\":\"Directional-token seam activation: corrected local rules and B=2 checklist (radius 1)\\n\\nCorrect token seeding and propagation (two-cell corridor)\\n- Corridor cells: CL (immediately right of S1) and CR (immediately left of S2). Each carries two token bits (t→, t←) ∈ {0,1}^2.\\n- Seeding at S:\\n  • At S1–CL: If the interior neighbor is GateL and S1 ∈ {R,G,B}, force CL.t→=1 and CL.t←=0; otherwise force CL=(0,0).\\n  • At S2–CR: If the interior neighbor is GateR and S2 ∈ {R,G,B}, force CR.t←=1 and CR.t→=0; otherwise force CR=(0,0).\\n- Asymmetric propagation across the corridor (left→right edge CL→CR): allowed iff CR.t→ ≥ CL.t→ and CR.t← ≤ CL.t←. Equivalently: Tok→ is nondecreasing left→right; Tok← is nondecreasing right→left. No 0→1 increase is possible except from its own seeding side. Outside the corridor, no symbol with a 1‑bit token is permitted.\\n- Consequences:\\n  • Mixed pairs (exactly one canonical/colored side): CL or CR may be (1,0) on the canonical side; the opposite cell remains (0,0). No Corr_11 appears; RUN/VERD remain absent.\\n  • Active–active (both sides canonical/colored): CL seeds (1,0), CR seeds (0,1); propagation yields CR=(1,1) and CL=(1,1) as needed; RUN is enabled and VERD must appear at CR.\\n\\nMust‑color and fallback (local at S)\\n- The must‑color trigger uses the opposite‑direction token bit only:\\n  • At S1: if CL.t← = 1, forbid S1=⊥ and forbid attaching to neutral PAD; require the designated FWD neighbor (color forwarder). If CL.t← = 0, allow S1=⊥ and permit neutral PAD.\\n  • At S2: if CR.t→ = 1, forbid S2=⊥ and neutral PAD; require VERD at CR. If CR.t→ = 0, allow S2=⊥ and neutral PAD.\\n- This guarantees: mixed pairs accept unconditionally (colored on the canonical side; ⊥ on the noncanonical side). Active–active pairs must color and run the verdict.\\n\\nPer‑bit probe (TS) recap and requirements\\n- Reserve B boundary 4‑tuples {Q_j}. Under Q_j and fixed boundary inputs a⋆, a deterministic pipeline Start_j→Head_j marches to the unique PORT cell with Addr=j and accepts iff RIDbit=1. While PROBE states are present: no ERR/⊥ adjacency and unique successors only. PORT contiguity enforces a contiguous block Addr=1,…,B abutting S.\\n- DP‑checkable claim: For canonical L(u), E_{L(u)}(a⋆)[Q_j] = u_j. Mirrored on the right.\\n\\nS2↔VERD acceptance table (local, exhaustive)\\n- VERD encodes (cFwd ∈ {R,G,B}, e=EDGE∈{0,1}, q=Eq∈{0,1}). Allowed pairs (S2_color, VERD(cFwd,e,q)) are exactly those satisfying:\\n  • If e=1 then S2_color ≠ cFwd; if e=0, no restriction.\\n  • If q=1 then S2_color = cFwd; if q=0, no restriction.\\n- Thus: (e,q)=(0,0): all 3×3 pairs; (1,0): all unequal pairs; (0,1): only equal pairs; (1,1): none (should be unreachable since we enforce D(u,u)=0).\\n\\nB=2 DP‑audit checklist (explicit)\\n1) Symbols:\\n  • S: S_⊥, S_R, S_G, S_B. Gate: GateL, GateR. PAD/ERR. PORT: P1^0,P1^1,P2^0,P2^1 (and probe‑active variants if used). PROBE: Start_j, Head_j, Test_j, Accept_j for j=1,2. Corridor tokens: Corr_ab for a,b∈{0,1} encoding (t→,t←). VERD(c∈{R,G,B}, e∈{0,1}, q∈{0,1}). Boundary outputs for Q_1,Q_2.\\n  • Cin–out: tie RIDbit to input bit for PORT; other roles accept both inputs.\\n2) Probes: enumerate Cout–out pairs for Start/Head/Test/Accept and forbid any ERR/⊥ adjacent to PROBE; list PORT contiguity (P1→P2 on the left; mirror on the right) and disallow any PROBE entry except from Q_j.\\n3) Gating: allow S_color only when adjacent neighbor is GateL/GateR; otherwise only S_⊥.\\n4) Tokens: seeding at S as above; corridor edge CL→CR obeys CR.t→ ≥ CL.t→ and CR.t← ≤ CL.t←; outside corridor, only Corr_00 is allowed.\\n5) Must‑color: if the opposite‑token bit at the S‑adjacent corridor cell = 1, forbid S=⊥ and forbid neutral PAD; otherwise allow both.\\n6) VERD/equations: enumerate the S2↔VERD acceptance table; wire (u,v)↦(e,q) by listing only those local pairs that allow the proper VERD to appear (expand VERD/Corr variants to encode the 16 cases, or constrain the corridor placement to “see” the two PORT bits via radius‑1 neighborhoods).\\n7) ERR discipline: omit ERR adjacency near PROBE/RUN/VERD in active modes; permit ERR away from special modes.\\n8) Tests to run by DP: \\n  • TS: For u∈{00,01,10,11}, verify E_{L(u)}(a⋆)[Q_1]=u_1 and E_{L(u)}(a⋆)[Q_2]=u_2.\\n  • Seam: For all 16 (u,v) with D a 4‑cycle and Eq=[u=v], verify active–active acceptance iff [(edge⇒colors differ) ∧ (u=v⇒colors equal)]. Verify that mixed pairs accept unconditionally (canonical side colored; opposite side ⊥).\\n\\nClarifications to remember\\n- Types are defined w.r.t. fixed interior inputs; Cin–out ties PORT.RIDbit to those inputs. \\n- Context set C (used in upper bounds and in our bookkeeping) can be taken as the set of types realized by w_1 S w_2 with |w_i| ∈ {ℓ_pump, ℓ_pump+1}; hence |C| ≤ ℓ_pump.
