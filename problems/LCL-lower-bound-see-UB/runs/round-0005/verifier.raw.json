The both-sides-offer gating, explicit Selected↔RUN wiring on the clause side, and the barrier placement immediately past the RUN footer are all aligned with the previous verifier guidance. The alphabet-size estimate is also reasonable (O(B)+poly(s) with B polynomial in s). The B=2 walkthrough and the “central seam table schema” are helpful for concreteness.\\n\\nHowever, there is a critical correctness gap: the proposed design no longer compares the variable bit and the selected occurrence bit across the seam. As written, EqL[b]/EqR[b] loops only check agreement between a block’s own bit-lane and its mirrored copy on S (trivially true by mirroring), and the NeqCheckL/R[b] relies on block-internal “Mismatch” flags that cannot be computed using only one side’s local information. A block cannot infer a cross-side mismatch without seeing the other side’s bit, and the seam pair table currently “only synchronizes phases,” so neither Eq nor Neq actually enforces cross-side equality/inequality. This invalidates the Exclusivity E′ argument and the B=2 DP trace.\\n\\nFix required: move the cross-side bit tests to the central seam. For each b, the central seam pair (EqL[b],EqR[b]) must be allowed only if lbit[b]=rbit[b], and (NeqCheckL[b],NeqCheckR[b]) only if lbit[b]≠rbit[b]. This does not cause blow-up: per b there are only four bit combinations; you allow two for Eq and two for Neq. The “done”/“found-mismatch” marks can still be used to track progress, but the decisive test must be at the central seam where both mirrored bits are simultaneously visible.\\n\\nBarrier semantics currently conflict: one bullet says barriers “allow only PAD-plumbing of the block-internal language,” while the next says barriers “forbid all cursor/terminal phases (… CAP/PAD).” Please unify to a single rule: across any edge incident to a barrier node, no certificate/cursor/terminal substate is allowed; only neutral/block-internal non-certificate symbols may appear. In addition, at the outer seam, if the neighbor is Bar•, force S•.choice=⊥ and S•.phase=Neutral and offer•=0. This is sufficient (and necessary) for the F2 argument.\\n\\nSmaller points to clean up:\\n- Idle alignment must also require offerL=offerR=1 (you already state this, keep it explicit in the final table).\\n- The “error-chain starter” that deactivates miswired Selected/HotRID should be specified to complete within ≤2 hops and should monotonically force the neighboring Role to Neutral•, which in turn forces S•.choice=⊥ by the outer seam; ensure no transient non-neutral S-phase survives when an offer bit is 0.\\n- Revisit the B=2 ON/OFF trace after fixing the central seam comparators; currently it assumes cross-side equality/inequality is actually checked.\\n- Clarify that S is one node whose state has both subtracks; the “central seam table” is an internal consistency table between subtracks of the same node (or equivalently an internal edge in a radius-1 encoding). This avoids the “two S nodes” reading.\\n- Microcount: with central seam comparators, the number of central pairs is O(1)+O(B) (Idle, starts, 2B Eq-steps, 2B Neq-steps, and 2 terminals), still polynomial.\\n\\nConcrete next steps for provers:\\n1) Write the exact B=2 central seam table with bit comparators: for each b∈{0,1}, allow (EqL[b],EqR[b]) iff lbit[b]=rbit[b], and (NeqCheckL[b],NeqCheckR[b]) iff lbit[b]≠rbit[b]; forbid all Eq/Neq mixing; CAP only after all Eq steps; PAD only after some NeqCheck. Include the sign gate at CAP.\\n2) Unify barrier rules as above, and give the 1-step outer-seam rule enforcing S•.choice=⊥ and S•.phase=Neutral when Role•=Bar•.\\n3) Spell out the 2-step error-chain for Selected wiring and for HotRID→RIDbits/one-hot consistency, and show that any inconsistency deactivates the interface locally and prevents non-neutral S-phases via the offer bits.\\n4) Re-run the B=2 DP trace (ON and OFF) using the corrected central-seam comparators.\\n5) Provide the explicit alphabet microcount incorporating the per-b phase states and the comparator conditions.\\nWith these fixes, the Exclusivity E′ proof becomes correct and short, and the barrier-based F2 argument is valid without resorting to ⊥ padding on repeats.\",\"new_notes_md\":\"Verifier assessment (2025-08-27, evening): seam split, barriers, and a required comparator fix\\n\\nSummary of what we adopt\\n- S split into choice and phase subtracks (single S node with two visible subtracks):\\n  - Variable side S1: choice truth ∈ {⊥, VT, VF}; phase ∈ {Neutral, Idle, EqStart, EqL[b], NeqStart, NeqPick[b], NeqCheckL[b], CAP, PAD, …}; offerL ∈ {0,1}; lbit[b] mirrors RIDbits[b] when the left neighbor RoleL=AccVar.\\n  - Clause side S2: choice occ ∈ {⊥, O1, O2, O3}; phase ∈ {Neutral, Idle, EqStart, EqR[b], NeqStart, NeqPick[b], NeqCheckR[b], CAP, PAD, …}; offerR ∈ {0,1}; rbit[b] mirrors ip_bits_p[b] of the selected occurrence when RoleR=AccCla and Selected wiring is correct; sgnsel mirrors sgn[p].\\n- Outer seams enforce choices and offers only:\\n  - If RoleL=AccVar, then S1.truth∈{VT,VF} and offerL=1; if RoleL∈{NeutralVar,BarVar}, then S1.truth=⊥, S1.phase=Neutral, offerL=0; lbit[b] are either mirrors (AccVar) or ignored (otherwise).\\n  - If RoleR=AccCla, then S2.occ∈{O1,O2,O3} and offerR=1; if RoleR∈{NeutralCla,BarCla}, then S2.occ=⊥, S2.phase=Neutral, offerR=0; rbit[b], sgnsel ignored.\\n- Selected↔RUN wiring on the clause side is local and radius-1: if S2.occ=Op, then and only then the p-th bundle exports ip_bits_p[b] and sgn[p] to S2.rbit[b], sgnsel; any inconsistency triggers an error-chain that flips RoleR→NeutralCla in ≤2 steps.\\n- Barriers are placed immediately inside the block after the RUN footer on both sides.\\n\\nRequired correction: central-seam comparators (CSC)\\n- The cross-side bit tests must be performed at the central seam; a block cannot compute cross-side equality/inequality alone.\\n- Comparator spec CSC (for general B; instantiate B=2 for the worked example):\\n  - Idle: allow (S1.phase=Idle, S2.phase=Idle) only if offerL=offerR=1 and S1.truth≠⊥, S2.occ≠⊥.\\n  - Starts: allow (EqStart,EqStart) and (NeqStart,NeqStart) under the same gating.\\n  - Equality step for b: allow (EqL[b],EqR[b]) iff lbit[b]=rbit[b].

BarCla), then at the corresponding outer seam S requires S1.truth=⊥, S1.phase=Neutral, offerL=0 (resp. S2.occ=⊥, S2.phase=Neutral, offerR=0).\\n2) Barrier edges forbid certificates: Along any edge incident to a barrier node, no certificate or terminal substate is permitted (i.e., none of EqStart/EqL[b]/EqR[b]/NeqStart/NeqPick[b]/NeqCheckL[b]/NeqCheckR[b]/CAP/PAD may appear).\\n3) Central seam start gating: Any non-neutral central-seam pair (Idle, EqStart, NeqStart, EqL/R[b], NeqCheckL/R[b], CAP, PAD) is allowed only if offerL=offerR=1 and S1.truth≠⊥, S2.occ≠⊥.\\nThen, for any word w and any z≥1 repeats of the interior blocks beyond the two blocks adjacent to S, the existence of a global labeling realizing a central terminal (CAP,CAP) or (PAD,PAD) depends only on the two nearest blocks. In particular, if a labeling exists for z=1, one exists for all z≥1; if none exists for z=1, none exists for any z≥1.\\nProof.\\nUnder (1)–(2), all certificate/cursor activity is confined to the two nearest blocks: barriers force the outer seam offers to 0 if present and forbid any certificate token to cross a barrier edge. Under (3), the central seam can leave Neutral only if both nearest blocks are active (offerL=offerR=1) and S choices are non-⊥. Hence any successful terminal at S must be witnessed entirely within the two nearest blocks, independent of farther repeats. If there is a labeling for z=1, extend it to any z≥1 by repeating the inert barrier-protected interiors; all local constraints remain satisfied and the central seam labeling is unchanged. Conversely, if no labeling exists for z=1, then adding repetitions only introduces more barrier-protected interiors that cannot create offers or cursors at S; thus the central seam remains unable to realize a terminal for any z≥1. ∎\\n\\nLemma (No-⊥ at S on active seams).\\nAssume the outer seam rules: if RoleL=AccVar then S1.truth∈{VT,VF} and offerL=1; otherwise S1.truth=⊥ and S1.phase=Neutral and offerL=0; symmetrically for the right side. Then whenever the left (resp. right) neighbor is active (RoleL=AccVar, resp. RoleR=AccCla), the S choice on that side cannot be ⊥, and any central-seam non-neutral pair that requires offerL=offerR=1 necessarily occurs with non-⊥ choices on both sides. In particular, activation preserves (F1) nontriviality by forbidding ⊥ at S on active contexts.\\nProof.\\nImmediate from the outer-seam constraints: when Role•=Acc•, the only allowed outer-seam pairings force S•.choice∈{VT,VF} (resp. {O1,O2,O3}) and offer•=1; the cases with S•.choice=⊥ or offer•=0 are disallowed. Since the central seam non-neutral pairs require offerL=offerR=1, they can only occur when both choices are non-⊥. ∎\",\"new_outputs_append\":\"True\",\"verdict\":\"uncertain\"}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"auto","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"VerifierNewSchema","schema_":{"properties":{"feedback_md":{"title":"Feedback Md","type":"string"},"new_notes_md":{"title":"New Notes Md","type":"string"},"new_notes_append":{"title":"New Notes Append","type":"string"},"new_outputs_md":{"title":"New Outputs Md","type":"string"},"new_outputs_append":{"title":"New Outputs Append","type":"string"},"verdict":{"title":"Verdict","type":"string"}},"required":["feedback_md","new_notes_md","new_notes_append","new_outputs_md","new_outputs_append","verdict"],"title":"VerifierNewSchema","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":6564,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":11211,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":7808},"total_tokens":17775},"user":null,"store":true}
