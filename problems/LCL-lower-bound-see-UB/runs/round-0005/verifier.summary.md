High-value progress: splitting the S-node into a product palette (choice vs phase subtracks) and making the outer seams constrain only choices while the central seam gates phases is the right structural move. The both-sides-offer gating, explicit Selected↔RUN wiring on the clause side, and the barrier placement immediately past the RUN footer are all aligned with the previous verifier guidance. The alphabet-size estimate is also reasonable (O(B)+poly(s) with B polynomial in s). The B=2 walkthrough and the “central seam table schema” are helpful for concreteness.
