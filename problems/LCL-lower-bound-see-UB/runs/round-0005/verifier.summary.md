Strong progress this round: all four reports converge on the same high-level gadgetry (per‑bit boundary probes for type separation, per‑side color gating, directional tokens for seam activation, and a local verdict cell enforcing EDGE/Eq). The symbol budgets and DP-auditable B=2 plan are sound. However, there are a few critical locality/consistency issues to fix before we can promote anything into output.md.
