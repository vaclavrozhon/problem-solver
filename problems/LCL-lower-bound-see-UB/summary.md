Goal: show NEXPTIME-hardness of the 3-way LOCAL classification for β-normalized, r=1 LCLs on oriented paths by reducing Succinct-3SAT to Feasible-Function Existence (F1). The last round (prover-04) gives a concrete reduction P_C: radius-1 gadgets (HEAD · RID · GID · RUN) plus an existential witness-chain that, when S is colored, nondeterministically selects an index i and locally verifies Hot_RID[i] and the clause bit V^{(±)}[i] via a row-by-row U-simulation. Key bounds: |Types| ≤ ℓ_pump = 2^{Θ(β^4)}, finite Z ≤ ℓ_pump^2 for (F2), and extension-check DP in O(k β^2). Neutralizing (F2) with a ⊥-filler transfers F1-hardness to the three-way classification. Correctness (completeness/soundness) sketched; remaining formal work: explicit radius-1 adjacency tables, witness-chain formalization, and a separability lemma proving distinct RID/GID yield distinct context types. Verifier verdict: partial success.

This round formalizes the reduction from Succinct 3-Coloring to Feasible-Function Existence for (F1) on β-normalized, radius-1 LCLs on paths. Main contributions: a radius-1 boundary-probe family Q_j that reads the j-th bit of a vertex index u (so extendibility under Q_j equals u_j), yielding ≥2^B distinct vertex context types; canonical left/right context shapes L(u), R(v) realizable at lengths ℓ_pump or ℓ_pump+1 whose types are determined by u/v; and a seam gadget that runs a universal TM U in the bridge to evaluate D(u,v) and exposes an Edge bit so the local seam enforces acceptance iff D(u,v)=0 or (D(u,v)=1 and the two S-colors differ). Adding ⊥-plumbing makes (F2) vacuous, so the 3-way classification reduces to (F1)-feasibility (hence NEXPTIME-hard). The verifier returned “partial success”: the construction is conceptually complete but key local rule tables and small-radius verification details remain to be written.

This round (prover-04) pins down three auditable, radius-1 gadgets for the S3Col → FFE(F1) reduction: (1) Lemma TS: a family of reserved per-bit boundary probes Q_j with pointer heads P_j deterministically walk a nearby PORT zone and test RidBit[j], so E_{L(u)}(a⋆)[Q_j]=u_j and there are ≥2^B distinct left (and symmetrically right) canonical types; probe-mode explicitly disables error-escape. (2) Lemma CG: an ACT handshake gates non-⊥ colors at the two S nodes so only canonical vertex contexts can be colored (others must be ⊥). (3) Lemma Seam: a nearest-neighbor bridge tableau simulates a universal TM to compute EDGE = D(u,v) and enforces locally that EDGE=1 ⇒ S-colors differ (EDGE=0 accepts unconditionally). Alphabet/radius bookkeeping (O(B) reserved symbols, β = poly(s)) and a global ⊥-filler to neutralize (F2) are given. Next deliverables are explicit Cin/Cout tables and a B=2 DP regression. One remaining point to clarify: explicit left/right color-consistency (Eq) enforcement.

## round-0004 — model summary — 2025-08-28T12:38:39.116830Z
Round 0004 (prover-04) converts the earlier sketches into explicit, radius-1 local-rule schemas that a DP verifier can check. Main deliverables: (i) a deterministic per-bit boundary probe (reserved boundary 4-tuples Q_j) with no ERR/⊥ escape and the Type-Separation claim E_{W_L(u)}(a⋆)[Q_j]=u_j, so 2^B left/right types; (ii) per-side GateL/GateR gating that permits colors at S only for canonical sides, ensures mixed pairs accept via neutral PAD plumbing, and enforces must-color only when both sides are canonical; (iii) a seam RUN_B tableau that writes VERD(FwdColor,EDGE,Eq) adjacent to S2 and enforces EDGE/Eq constraints purely by the S2↔VERD radius-1 pair; (iv) an explicit alphabet budget (|Σ_out| = Θ(B), choose β ≥ c·B) and a concrete B=2 skeleton plus DP audit plan. The construction neutralizes F2 by ⊥-plumbing and notes reliance on pumping/replacement lemmas to guarantee canonical contexts at lengths ℓ_pump/ℓ_pump+1.

## round-0005 — model summary — 2025-08-28T12:46:48.703616Z
Round 0005 delivered DP-checkable, radius-1 rule schemas that complete the S3Col→FFE(F1) reduction skeleton. Main building blocks: deterministic per-bit probes (Start/Head/Test/Accept + contiguous PORT) that separate 2^B types; per-side gating with directional tokens Tok→/Tok← that are seeded only for canonical colored sides and propagate monotonically so RUN/VERD activate only in active–active pairs; a one-cell VERD(e,q,cFwd) next to S2 whose allowed S2↔VERD pairs simultaneously enforce EDGE and Eq (with D(u,u)=0 to avoid contradictions); a bridging design that confines all constraints to a constant-width corridor so (F2) is vacuous/z-invariant; and a radius-1 padding lemma that guarantees canonical contexts at lengths ℓ_pump or ℓ_pump+1. A concrete B=2 skeleton (≈45 symbols, O(10^2) adjacency pairs) and a DP audit checklist (16 seam cases + 4 probe seeds) were supplied. Verifier: “partial success.”
