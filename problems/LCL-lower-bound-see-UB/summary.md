In this round, the prover outlined a structured mini-plan to tackle the complexities of LCLs and their hardness classifications. Key areas of focus include a thorough understanding of the PSPACE-hardness proof, careful analysis of a proposed NEXPTIME algorithm, and the exploration of reductions from known NEXPTIME-hard problems. The prover emphasized the importance of systematic exploration of LCL cases and the formulation of lemmas regarding the relationship between local complexity and the size of $\beta$. However, the verifier noted that while the plan is well-structured, it requires deeper analysis and caution against misinterpretations and generalizations. The overall verdict remains uncertain, indicating that further refinement and validation are necessary.

Round snapshot: two prover sketches plus verifier feedback. Prover-01 proposed a window-anchored activation fix (place RID/GID and HEAD/RUN inside wb/wc) and pumping-based existence of many active types; it also argued inactive contexts can be neutralized with ⊥ and that (F2) can be trivialized by ⊥-plumbing. Prover-02 introduced a gated-bridge gadget that turns ON only for intended (VAR_i, CLA_j) ordered pairs (forcing CAP propagation when i ∈ vars(j)), plus two finite-check lemmas (finite-z periodicity for (F2) and a layered radius-1 DP for extendibility in O(k·β^2)). The verifier endorsed combining gating with window-anchoring but flagged two untenable claims (deriving 2^B types from only 2 boundary nodes; O(1) local clause-triple validation) and requested explicit C_in–out/C_out–out tables for the four boundary nodes and conduits, a formal type-separation lemma, and a poly(s)-length clause-decoder tableau. Verdict: uncertain. Citations: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json, Verifier (summary_md).

lets try to prove this by reducing to (implicit exponential-sized) SAT formula

## round-0002 — model summary — 2025-08-27T11:30:43.966675Z
Round 0002 completed a focused repair and formalization of the reduction from Succinct-3SAT to feasible-function existence for β-normalized, r=1 LCLs. Core moves: recast (F1) as an implicit exponential SAT over type-choices; replace the previous gate with an equality/inequality witness gate so each clause-side pick activates exactly one variable-side pair; implement clause decoding as a poly(s)-length, radius-1 tableau that exposes (i1,i2,i3) and signs and yields local error-chain refuters for malformed runs; show existence and separability of 2^B variable- and clause-types via window-anchored blocks and differential extendibility; and trivialize (F2) via ⊥-plumbing so the classification reduces to (F1). Together these yield an implicit CNF (Horn-style clauses (¬Y ∨ X)) equivalent to the succinct 3CNF, giving the intended NEXPTIME hardness direction. Remaining concrete artifacts are explicit seam tables, the RUN tile set, a radius-1 exclusivity proof for equality vs inequality certificates, and a full B=2 DP worked example.

## round-0003 — model summary — 2025-08-27T11:44:17.213609Z
Round 0003 produced a converging patch that (a) enforces active seams so ⊥ at S is forbidden in active contexts, (b) restricts the clause S-palette to occurrences {O1,O2,O3} and binds signs to the verified RUN, and (c) implements a radius‑1 Exclusivity Lemma for equality vs. inequality witness chains. Two complementary seam designs were presented (input-coded DoorVar/DoorCl/DoorPAD and Offer/NoOffer); nearest‑block barriers (preferred by the verifier) or a RepeatPAD pattern were proposed to make (F2) hold without trivializing (F1). Core invariants are one‑hot RID, redundant binary lanes, pointer‑integrity tiles, and a monotone eq_so_far/neq mode that gates CAP vs PAD. B=2 toy traces were sketched to sanity‑check ON/OFF cases. Outstanding concrete artifacts requested by the verifier: explicit Cout/Cin seam tables, de Bruijn‑style pointer tiles, a RUN tile set, and a full 12‑node B=2 DP trace.

## round-0004 — model summary — 2025-08-27T14:54:17.527357Z
This round constructs a radius-1, type-local seam gadget split into two S-nodes (S1 on the variable side, S2 on the clause side) with explicit out–out edge tables at the left, central and right seams. The tables (i) forbid ⊥ at active seams, (ii) allow EqStart/NeqStart only when both sides offer, and (iii) enforce mutual exclusion and sign-gating of CAP/PAD. Equality/inequality certificates are implemented with pointer-integrity: RIDbits + HotRID on the variable side, Selected + ip_bits + sign on the clause side, and per-bit cursor tokens (EqL/EqR, NeqPick/NeqCheck). A radius-1 exclusivity lemma (E’) shows exactly one terminal (CAP or PAD) can succeed per active pair; any spoofing triggers an error-chain that removes Offer. Nearest-block barrier tokens placed one node past RUN footers kill cursors and force seam-neutrality beyond the nearest blocks, making (F2) independent of repetitions. A worked B=2 DP trace (ON vs OFF) is given. Pending: explicit out–out tile lists and a small symbol-count check. Source: prover-01.out.json (progress_md).
