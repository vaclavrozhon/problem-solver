# Incremental Progress on NEXPTIME-hardness Proof for LCL on Globally Oriented Paths

## Summary of Prover Ideas
- The provers are exploring the NEXPTIME-hardness of $eta$-normalized, radius-1 LCLs on globally oriented paths, building on existing PSPACE-hardness results.
- They suggest modifications to automata and encoding complexities as potential avenues for increasing complexity.
- Examples of LCL problems are proposed to test the robustness of their claims, but these need further elaboration.

## Identified Gaps
- Lack of rigorous justification for the transition from PSPACE to NEXPTIME.
- Insufficient detail in examples and counterexamples to support claims.
- Need for a formal error chain and analysis of the Pumping Lemma's applicability.

## Next Steps
1. Develop a formal framework to illustrate the transition from PSPACE to NEXPTIME.
2. Analyze the Pumping Lemma in the context of LCL problems.
3. Implement an automated checker prototype for small $eta$ values.
