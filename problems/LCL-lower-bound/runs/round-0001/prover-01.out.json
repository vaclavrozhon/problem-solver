The key is to explore modifications to the automata used in the encoding and to analyze how these modifications can lead to an increase in complexity. \n\n### Lemmas from Literature\n1. **Pumping Lemma for Regular Languages**: This lemma states that for sufficiently long strings in a regular language, we can find substrings that can be "
