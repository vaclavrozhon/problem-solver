  "summary_md": "This round focused on advancing the proof of NEXPTIME-hardness for locally checkable labeling (LCL) problems on globally oriented paths. Building on previous PSPACE-hardness results, the exploration included encoding complexities, modifications to automata, and hierarchical structures. Key examples were proposed to test the robustness of claims, while obstacles such as technical limitations and potential complexity collapses were identified. Next steps involve developing a formal error chain, defining pump-length bounds, and creating an automated checker prototype.",
