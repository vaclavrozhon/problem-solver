  "feedback_md": "The prover reports present interesting ideas towards establishing the NEXPTIME-hardness of LCL problems on globally oriented paths, building on previously established PSPACE-hardness results. However, both reports lack rigorous justification for their claims and do not provide concrete proofs or counterexamples. The first report mentions the Pumping Lemma for Regular Languages but does not elaborate on how it applies to the current context, which is a missed opportunity for rigor. The second report introduces several promising directions, such as encoding complexity and modifications to automata, but fails to provide a clear pathway to transition from PSPACE to NEXPTIME hardness. The suggested examples are a good start, but they need to be fleshed out with specific details and analyses to validate their relevance. The obstacles identified are valid, especially regarding the implications of complexity class collapses. Next steps should include: 1) Developing a formal framework to illustrate the transition from PSPACE to NEXPTIME, possibly by constructing specific examples that demonstrate this transition; 2) Providing a detailed analysis of the Pumping Lemma in the context of LCL problems; 3) Implementing the automated checker prototype to validate claims against small $\beta$ values. This will help in building a more robust argument for the NEXPTIME-hardness claim and addressing the gaps identified in the outputs.md.",
