  "summary_md": "This round specialized the paper's feasible-function framework to radius-1, \u03b2-normalized LCLs on globally oriented paths and developed an explicit single-exponential finite-state abstraction (types). We proved a type-count bound |T| \u2264 16\u00b72^{\u03b2^4}, gave a deterministic DP to enumerate reachable types and compute the append-one-bit successor \u03b4 in time 2^{poly(\u03b2)}, and defined per-type macro relations R_t summarizing how a block bridges outside outputs. Using these primitives we sketched NEXPTIME verifiers: (i) guess a type-indexed feasible function F to separate \u03a9(n) vs o(n); (ii) guess per-type boundary quadruples Q_t to separate O(1) vs \u03a9(log* n). The Verifier flagged a critical soundness gap: naive composition of R_t via an intermediate label m is unsound \u2014 one must compute concatenated summaries (Ext) and derive R for the concatenation (a small 3-color counterexample demonstrates the failure). Next steps are to formalize/correct \u03b4, fix bridging composition, and prove the boundary-interface witness equivalence.",

    "Critical soundness gap identified by the Verifier: composing R_t via an intermediate color m (checking (s1_last,m)\u2208R_b and (m,s2_first)\u2208R_c) is not generally sufficient \u2014 must form concatenated Ext for the combined block first; a 3-color counterexample breaks naive m-composition.",
    "Linchpin remaining issue: the append-one-bit transition \u03b4 is underspecified for short representatives and must be formalized and proven congruent on types; without this, the closure and all downstream checks can be incorrect."
