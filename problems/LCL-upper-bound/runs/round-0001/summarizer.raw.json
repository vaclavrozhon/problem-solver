We proved a type-count bound |T| ≤ 16·2^{β^4}, gave a deterministic DP to enumerate reachable types and compute the append-one-bit successor δ in time 2^{poly(β)}, and defined per-type macro relations R_t summarizing how a block bridges outside outputs. Using these primitives we sketched NEXPTIME verifiers: (i) guess a type-indexed feasible function F to separate Ω(n) vs o(n); (ii) guess per-type boundary quadruples Q_t to separate O(1) vs Ω(log* n). The Verifier flagged a critical soundness gap: naive composition of R_t via an intermediate label m is unsound — one must compute concatenated summaries (Ext) and derive R for the concatenation (a small 3-color counterexample demonstrates the failure). Next steps are to formalize/correct δ, fix bridging composition, and prove the boundary-interface witness equivalence.\",\"highlights\":[\"Specialized finite-state abstraction for r=1 with type-count bound |T| ≤ 16·2^{β^4} (single-exponential in β).\",\"Deterministic DP to enumerate reachable types and compute δ: overall preprocessing in 2^{poly(β)} time, avoiding doubly-exponential enumeration of length-ℓ_pump strings.\",\"Definition and computation of macro bridging relations R_t ⊆ Σ_out×Σ_out (β×β boolean matrices) derived from per-type Ext_t; used to certify fillability of unlabeled blocks.\",\"NEXPTIME verification sketches: (a) guess a type-indexed feasible function F to decide Ω(n) vs o(n); (b) guess per-type boundary quadruples Q_t (or pref/suff pairs) to decide O(1) vs Ω(log* n); both run in nondeterministic 2^{poly(β)} time.\",\"Critical soundness gap identified by the Verifier: composing R_t via an intermediate color m (checking (s1_last,m)∈R_b and (m,s2_first)∈R_c) is not generally sufficient — must form concatenated Ext for the combined block first; a 3-color counterexample breaks naive m-composition.\",\"Linchpin remaining issue: the append-one-bit transition δ is underspecified for short representatives and must be formalized and proven congruent on types; without this, the closure and all downstream checks can be incorrect.\"],\"next_questions\":[\"Formalize and prove correctness of the append-one-bit transition δ (exact DP mapping Ext_t → Ext_{t'}) including all k<4 corner cases, and prove congruence properties needed for type closure.\",\"Replace naive R_t composition with a concatenation primitive: implement summary concatenation, compute R for concatenated summaries, and re-run Stage‑1/Stage‑2 verifiers; validate the fix using the provided 3-color counterexample.\",\"Prove (or if needed, extend) that the per-type boundary-interface witness (pref2/suff2 or Q_t) is equivalent to the paper's feasible-function witness for O(1); then finalize full correctness proofs and run small implementation tests.\" ,\"citations_to_files_or_papers:[\"\n\n  ]}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"default","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"SummarizerOutput","schema_":{"properties":{"summary_md":{"description":"Readable summary of the round","title":"Summary Md","type":"string"},"highlights":{"items":{"type":"string"},"title":"Highlights","type":"array"},"next_questions":{"items":{"type":"string"},"title":"Next Questions","type":"array"}},"required":["summary_md","highlights","next_questions"],"title":"SummarizerOutput","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":9703,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2689,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":1984},"total_tokens":12392},"user":null,"store":true}
