{"summary_md":"This round specialized the paper's feasible-function framework to radius-1, β-normalized LCLs on globally oriented paths and developed an explicit single-exponential finite-state abstraction (types). We proved a type-count bound |T| ≤ 16·2^{β^4}, gave a deterministic DP to enumerate reachable types and compute the append-one-bit successor δ in time 2^{poly(β)}, and defined per-type macro relations R_t summarizing how a block bridges outside outputs. Using these primitives we sketched NEXPTIME verifiers: (i) guess a type-indexed feasible function F to separate Ω(n) vs o(n); (ii) guess per-type boundary quadruples Q_t to separate O(1) vs Ω(log* n). The Verifier flagged a critical soundness gap: naive composition of R_t via an intermediate label m is unsound — one must compute concatenated summaries (Ext) and derive R for the concatenation (a small 3-color counterexample demonstrates the failure). Next steps are to formalize/correct δ, fix bridging composition, and prove the boundary-interface witness equivalence.","highlights":["Specialized finite-state abstraction for r=1 with type-count bound |T| ≤ 16·2^{β^4} (single-exponential in β).","Deterministic DP to enumerate reachable types and compute δ: overall preprocessing in 2^{poly(β)} time, avoiding doubly-exponential enumeration of length-ℓ_pump strings.","Definition and computation of macro bridging relations R_t ⊆ Σ_out×Σ_out (β×β boolean matrices) derived from per-type Ext_t; used to certify fillability of unlabeled blocks.","NEXPTIME verification sketches: (a) guess a type-indexed feasible function F to decide Ω(n) vs o(n); (b) guess per-type boundary quadruples Q_t (or pref/suff pairs) to decide O(1) vs Ω(log* n); both run in nondeterministic 2^{poly(β)} time.","Critical soundness gap identified by the Verifier: composing R_t via an intermediate color m (checking (s1_last,m)∈R_b and (m,s2_first)∈R_c) is not generally sufficient — must form concatenated Ext for the combined block first; a 3-color counterexample breaks naive m-composition.","Linchpin remaining issue: the append-one-bit transition δ is underspecified for short representatives and must be formalized and proven congruent on types; without this, the closure and all downstream checks can be incorrect."],"next_questions":["Formalize and prove correctness of the append-one-bit transition δ (exact DP mapping Ext_t → Ext_{t'}) including all k<4 corner cases, and prove congruence properties needed for type closure.","Replace naive R_t composition with a concatenation primitive: implement summary concatenation, compute R for concatenated summaries, and re-run Stage‑1/Stage‑2 verifiers; validate the fix using the provided 3-color counterexample.","Prove (or if needed, extend) that the per-type boundary-interface witness (pref2/suff2 or Q_t) is equivalent to the paper's feasible-function witness for O(1); then finalize full correctness proofs and run small implementation tests." ,"citations_to_files_or_papers:["
