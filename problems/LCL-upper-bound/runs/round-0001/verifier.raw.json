This is the right direction and, if made precise, can plausibly yield a NEXPTIME procedure. However, there are two major correctness gaps that must be fixed to make the approach sound: (i) the append-one-bit transition δ on types must be proved well-defined and computed with the correct boundary-indexing; (ii) composing macro relations R_t across adjacent blocks via an intermediate color m is unsound in general and must be replaced by explicit concatenation at the level of type summaries (Ext tables) to derive the combined block’s summary.\\n\\n3-row audit table:\\n| Claim (short) | Status | Why |\\n| Type count ≤ 16·2^{β^4} (r=1) | OK | Boundary inputs: 2^4 choices; extendibility set over Σ_out^4: ≤2^{β^4}; multiply. Matches standard pumping bounds. |\\n| δ (append-one-bit) well-defined/computable from Ext | Unclear | Needs a congruence lemma: Type(P)=Type(Q) ⇒ Type(Pa)=Type(Qa). Prover 02’s concrete formula misindexes boundary entries (confuses old second-last vs old last), and Prover 01 leaves cases to be finalized. A correct O(β^5) DP exists but must be stated and proved. |\\n| Stage-1 bridging via R_t composition with ∃m | Broken | In general, (x,m)∈R_{t_b} and (m,y)∈R_{t_c} does not imply (x,y) is achievable for the concatenation t_b·t_c: the seam requires E(o_R1^b,o_L1^c), not E(o_R1^b,m)∧E(m,o_L1^c). Counterexample: Σ_out={a,b,c}, E={a→b, b→c} only; take t_b forcing its right boundary to a, t_c forcing its left boundary to c. Then choose m=b so both R-conditions hold, but the concatenation needs a→c, which is forbidden. The correct test computes the concatenated summary and checks its R directly. |\\n\\nSpecific to Prover 01:\\n- Strong: tight state bound; clear DP/BFS plan to enumerate reachable types; the macro R_t definition is fine; attention to reversal is good.\\n- Issues: δ update is currently underspecified and the sketch mixes up new right-two boundary outputs (should be (old last, new), not (new, ?)). The Stage-1/Stage-2 verifiers rely on composing R_t via an intermediate color m; this is unsound as above. The aside “indeed EXPTIME” is unsubstantiated; existence of a large table is an existential property—without a specialized solver, this is at best NEXPTIME by guessing.\\n\\nSpecific to Prover 02:\\n- Strong: clean formalization of summaries, and a correct concatenation primitive at the Ext-level; the Stage-1 verifier checks concatenation of summaries (R_B), which avoids the m-composition pitfall. The type-closure DFA construction idea is good.\\n- Issue: the append-one-bit formula for R′ is incorrect: it treats P′’s right-neighbor (old last) as the third coordinate of R for P; in fact, the new right-two outputs are (old last, new), so for each (o1′,o2′,o3′,o4′) you must check ∃ oldR2 with (o1′,o2′, oldR2, o3′)∈R, E(o3′,o4′), and A_α(o4′).\\n\\nWhat to repair and prove next:\\n1) State and prove the congruence lemma: if Type(P)=Type(Q) then Type(Pa)=Type(Qa), and more generally Summ(P·X) depends only on Summ(P) and Summ(X). This underwrites δ being a function on types and the correctness of concatenation.\\n2) Give the exact δ recurrence (corrected boundary indexing) and handle k<4 base cases once-and-for-all with a short proof.\\n3) Replace all uses of “∃m with (x,m)∈R_{t_b} and (m,y)∈R_{t_c}” by: compute the concatenated summary Summ(rep(t_b)·rep(t_c)) and check its R directly.\\n4) For O(1) vs Ω(log* n), justify rigorously that boundary interfaces (first-two/last-two outputs per type) suffice; i.e., Section 4.4’s construction only needs 2-node boundary consistency and join edges between repeats. If not, augment the witness accordingly.\\n5) Keep complexity claims conservative: NEXPTIME is supported; EXPTIME would need a deterministic solver for the existential tables (e.g., fixed-point/automata arguments).\",\n  \"summary_md\": \"- The finite-state type abstraction and the single-exponential bound in β look correct and useful; this keeps all search tables and verification at size 2^{poly(β)}.\\n- Major soundness gap: composing macro relations R_t via an intermediate color m is wrong; you must form concatenated summaries (Ext) and derive R for the concatenation before testing bridging. A small 3-color counterexample breaks the m-composition.\\n- The append-one-bit transition δ is the linchpin: prove it is well-defined on types (congruence) and implement the correct DP that maps Ext_t to Ext_{t′} with precise boundary indexing; current formulas are incorrect/underspecified.\\n- Stage 1 (Ω(n) vs o(n)) is promising if rephrased to use concatenation of summaries; Prover 02’s version is close to correct once δ is fixed.\\n- Stage 2 (O(1) vs Ω(log* n)) via boundary interfaces is plausible but needs a clear equivalence proof to the paper’s feasible-function framework; otherwise, be ready to augment the witness.\\n- Complexity: NEXPTIME membership is well supported. Avoid claiming EXPTIME without an explicit deterministic solver for the existential witnesses.\\n- Next: formalize δ and concatenation lemmas, implement the summary closure, and test on counterexamples that distinguish R-composition from summary-concatenation; then write the Stage 1/2 verifiers against the corrected primitives.\",\n  \"verdict\": \"promising\",\n  \"blocking_issues\": [\n    \"Unsound composition of R_t across adjacent blocks (∃m) — must use concatenation at the Ext level and recompute R for the combined block.\",\n    \"Append-one-bit δ not yet proved well-defined on types and misindexed in formulas; needs a clean DP and congruence proof.\",\n    \"Claims of EXPTIME (deterministic) classification lack justification; current approach yields NEXPTIME.\"\n  ],\n  \"per_prover\": [\n    {\n      \"prover_id\": \"01\",\n      \"brief_feedback\": \"Good type bound and overall plan; R_t definition OK.
