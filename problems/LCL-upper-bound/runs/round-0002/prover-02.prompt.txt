\paragraph{One-line summary.}
Design a nondeterministic exponential-time algorithm (NEXPTIME algorithm) that decides, given a $\beta$-normalized, radius-1 LCL on globally oriented paths, whether the local complexity of that problem is $O(1)$ vs.\ $\Omega(\log^* n)$ vs.\ $\Omega(n)$.


\section*{Problem setup}


We work in the standard \textsc{Local} model on globally oriented paths. An LCL is \emph{$\beta$-normalized (radius 1)} if it has:
\begin{itemize}
  \item binary input alphabet $\SigIn=\{0,1\}$,
  \item output alphabet $\SigOut$ of size $\beta$,
  \item legality checked only by two tables: $\Cinout\subseteq\SigIn\times\SigOut$ and $\Coutout\subseteq\SigOut\times\SigOut$.
\end{itemize}
A labeling is legal iff $(\mathrm{in}(v),\mathrm{out}(v))\in \Cinout$ at each node $v$ and $(\mathrm{out}(u),\mathrm{out}(v))\in \Coutout$ on each directed edge $u\!\to\! v$.


\paragraph{Encoding size.}
We assume an explicit encoding of $(\Cinout,\Coutout)$ of size $\mathrm{poly}(\beta)$ (e.g., $\Cinout$ as a $2\times \beta$ Boolean table and $\Coutout$ as a $\beta\times \beta$ Boolean table). We measure time in the input length $N=\mathrm{poly}(\beta)$.


\paragraph{Your task}
Your task is to construct as efficient an algorithm as possible for the task of deciding the local complexity of an input $\beta$-normalized problem. Aim for a nondeterministic exponential time algorithm. 


\paragraph{Attached paper}
The attached paper proves that the problem is decidable. Their algorithm is based on the notion of a feasible function and, naively, it needs doubly exponential time. You have to understand that paper thoroughly, since your goal is to improve upon their result.

## Round 0001 — 2025-08-27T10:32:01.431496Z

Mini-plan
- Formalize an exponential-size, finite state abstraction ("types") tailored to radius-1, β-normalized LCLs on globally oriented paths; give an explicit constructive algorithm to enumerate types in time 2^{poly(N)}.
- Recast the paper’s “feasible function” definitions purely in terms of these types, so that the witness size is 2^{poly(N)} and feasibility checking is deterministic 2^{poly(N)}.
- Design a nondeterministic exponential-time (NEXPTIME) procedure to distinguish Ω(n) vs o(n) by guessing a type-indexed feasible function f and verifying its universal constraints by dynamic-programming/composition over types.
- Sketch an NEXPTIME procedure to distinguish O(1) vs Ω(log* n) by guessing a succinct witness of constant-time solvability and checking it via the same type machinery. Identify and minimize what must be guessed to keep the certificate within 2^{poly(N)}.
- Stress-test key steps on toy instances (tiny β) and list potential failure modes (e.g., size blow-ups, missing symmetry cases) with quick checks.

Context recap and normalization
- Input: β-normalized radius-1 LCL on globally oriented paths, encoded by two Boolean tables: C_in–out ⊆ {0,1} × Σ_out and C_out–out ⊆ Σ_out × Σ_out. Encoding size N = Θ(β^2) (dominant term β×β out–out table plus 2×β in–out rows). Goal: decide local complexity class ∈ {O(1), Θ(log* n), Θ(n)}.
- Known (Balliu et al.): on labeled paths/cycles, deterministic complexity is in {O(1), Θ(log* n), Θ(n)}; decidability shown via “types”/pumping and feasible functions, but naive runtime can be doubly exponential in β by ranging over strings of length ℓ_pump (itself exponential in β).
- Our aim: reorganize everything at the level of types (finite-state summaries), never at the level of strings of length ℓ_pump; then guessing the witness (a mapping on types) takes 2^{poly(N)} bits/time; verifying universally quantified constraints over all contexts reduces to 2^{poly(N)} checks, each doable in poly(β)·|T| time. This yields NEXPTIME overall.

Core technical object: type summaries for radius 1
- Radius r = 1. For any input-labeled directed path P, define D1 = {first, last node} and D2 = {second, second-last}. Define a summary Summ(P) consisting of:
  - Boundary inputs b_in(P) = (i1, i2, i3, i4) ∈ {0,1}^4 for the nodes in D1 ∪ D2, in order (leftmost to rightmost).
  - A relation R_P ⊆ Σ_out^4 over boundary outputs (o1,o2,o3,o4), which holds iff “there exists a complete output labeling on the interior (D3) s.t. all nodes in D2∪D3 are locally consistent, and all edges internal to P touching D2 are locally consistent.” This is exactly the paper’s extendibility notion with boundary fixed on D1∪D2.
- Two paths have the same type iff their (b_in, R) are identical. The number of possible types is ≤ 2^{|Σ_out|^{4}} · |Σ_in|^{4} = 2^{β^4} · 16. This matches Lemma 13 (with r=1). Importantly, types form a finite set T of size τ ≤ 16·2^{β^4} = 2^{poly(N)}.
- Composition primitives (needed later):
  1) Appending one input bit α ∈ {0,1}. If Summ(P) = (i1,i2,i3,i4, R) and P’ = P·α, then Summ(P’) = (i1,i2,i4,α, R’) where for any boundary outputs (o1’,o2’,o3’,o4’), we have (o1’,o2’,o3’,o4’) ∈ R’ iff ∃y ∈ Σ_out s.t. (o1’,o2’,o3’,y) ∈ R, (y,o4’) ∈ C_out–out, and (α,o4’) ∈ C_in–out. This is computable by iterating over β^5 possibilities, hence poly(β) time per boundary quadruple; R’ has size β^4 entries.
  2) Concatenation B = P·Q. If Summ(P)=(i1,i2,i3,i4,R_P), Summ(Q)=(j1,j2,j3,j4,R_Q), and the actual concatenation has those boundary inputs (which hold by construction when P and Q are actual representatives we will compute), then Summ(B) carries boundary inputs (i1,i2,j3,j4) and relation R_B consists of all (o1,o2,o3’,o4’) for which ∃(x3,x4,x1’,x2’) with (o1,o2,x3,x4)∈R_P, (x1’,x2’,o3’,o4’)∈R_Q, and (x4,x1’) ∈ C_out–out (check only the single joint edge; all other local conditions are already encoded in R_P and R_Q). This can be computed in time roughly O(β^8) naively, still poly(β) for fixed β.

Algorithmic building of types in exp time (deterministic)
Claim A (constructibility): We can enumerate all reachable type summaries T and their transitions (append 0/1) in deterministic time 2^{poly(N)}.
- Construction: Initialize S with the 16 types of length-4 strings w ∈ {0,1}^4 by direct evaluation of Summ(w). For each s ∈ S and α ∈ {0,1}, compute s’ = δ(s,α) using Appending-1-bit primitive; if s’ new, add to S; iterate to fixpoint. This is a standard DFA closure over inputs {0,1} in state space of size ≤ τ.
- Costs: There are ≤ τ states, each yields ≤ 2 successors; each δ computation requires O(β^5)·β^4 = poly(β)·β^4 boolean assignments processing to fill R’ (β^4 table). Overall time and memory ≤ τ·poly(β)·β^4 = 2^{poly(N)}. Hence EXPTIME (deterministic). We will use this construction as a preprocessing step; it avoids handling strings of length ℓ_pump explicitly.
- Why useful here: Everything we must check later depends only on types and their relations; this preprocessing gives us a finite, explicit universe T with computable composition.
- How it can fail: Subtlety around paths of length < 4. We avoided it by seeding S with all length-4 strings and then only appending (growing) strings; definitions of Summ for length 4 are exact (D3 empty). Quick test: For β=2, compute all 16 initial summaries and one δ step; check counts stay ≤ τ bound and relations are computed as specified.

Deciding Ω(n) vs o(n): NEXPTIME via type-indexed feasible function f
Background: Paper’s Lemma 17–18: o(n) iff there exists a feasible function f that locally pre-labels certain 2-node separators S (here |S|=2 since r=1) so that the remaining parts can always be extended.
Our type-level specialization (globally oriented paths: no reversal needed):
- Domain of f: triples (tL, s_in, tR) where tL, tR ∈ T and s_in ∈ {0,1}^2 is the input pattern on the 2-node separator S. Range: a 2-tuple of outputs in Σ_out^2 prescribing the outputs on the two nodes of S.
- Size of domain: |T|^2 · 4 = 2^{poly(N)}. So f can be stored in 2^{poly(N)} bits.
- Universal feasibility condition to verify for a guessed f:
  For all t_a, t_b, t_c, t_d ∈ T and s1, s2 ∈ {0,1}^2, consider the input-labeled path
    P = rep(t_a) · S1 · rep(t_b) · rep(t_c) · S2 · rep(t_d),
  where rep(t) is any fixed representative string realizing type t (we pick those during preprocessing when we first discover t). Let the outputs on S1 and S2 be f(t_a, s1, t_b) and f(t_c, s2, t_d) respectively. Then we require that there exists an output assignment for the middle block B = rep(t_b) · rep(t_c) such that:
  (i) both S1 nodes are locally consistent (C_in–out and the single crossing edge to B),
  (ii) all nodes of B are locally consistent,
  (iii) both S2 nodes are locally consistent (C_in–out and the crossing edge from B).
- How to check exist(B): compute Summ(B) by concatenating Summ(rep(t_b)) and Summ(rep(t_c)) via the concatenation primitive. Let αL be the rightmost output of S1 (the second component of f(t_a,s1,t_b)), and αR the leftmost output of S2 (the first component of f(t_c,s2,t_d)). Then exist(B) holds iff there exist outputs (o1,o2,o3,o4) on B’s D1∪D2 such that (o1,o2,o3,o4)∈R_B, (αL,o1)∈C_out–out, (o4,αR)∈C_out–out, and (input-consistency of the 2 nodes of S1 and S2) holds. This is a finite search over β^4 tuples (o1..o4), i.e., poly(β).
- NEXPTIME procedure (stage 1):
  1) Deterministically build T and, for each t∈T, a representative rep(t), plus Summ(rep(t)).
  2) Nondeterministically guess f: T×{0,1}^2×T → Σ_out^2. Guessing costs |T|^2·4·2logβ bits.
  3) Deterministically verify the universal feasibility condition across all |T|^4·16 cases (composition per case in time poly(β) and looking up precomputed summaries). If all pass, conclude o(n); else Ω(n).
- Complexity: Step (1) runs in 2^{poly(N)} time deterministically. Step (2) guessing uses ≤ 2^{poly(N)} bits/time. Step (3) runs in |T|^4·poly(β) ≤ 2^{poly(N)} time. Hence nondeterministic 2^{poly(N)} overall. This achieves NEXPTIME for separating Ω(n) vs o(n).
- How it can fail: We used a representative rep(t_b)·rep(t_c) for B, but the feasible-function property quantifies over all strings of those types. This is safe by Lemma 10/11: extendibility on D2∪D3 is preserved when replacing a subpath with another of the same type, for any boundary assignment on D1∪D2. Our check existentially quantifies over B’s boundary outputs (and only constrains the crossing edges to S1/S2), exactly the setting where type replacement is sound.
- Quick toy check: β=2, choose trivial constraints that allow any (in,out) and any (out,out). Then T collapses to a tiny set, and any f passes; algorithm outputs o(n) (indeed the problem is solvable in 0 rounds). If we force a “global bit copy to all nodes” constraint (as in the PSPACE-hard encoding, but with tiny B), the check should fail for any f, yielding Ω(n).

Deciding O(1) vs Ω(log* n): toward a type-succinct constant-time witness
We need a 2^{poly(N)}-size witness for O(1) (avoid listing a full periodic output string for every length-≤ℓ_pump w).
Key observation from the O(1) framework (Section 4.4–4.5 of the paper):
- The O(1) algorithm only uses boundary behavior of the repetitive patterns: it pre-labels 2-node separators inside “repetitive” blocks and uses type pumping to argue about extendibility. Concretely, when verifying that the pattern w can be tiled, what matters is the existence of consistent boundary outputs for copies of rep(t), not the entire output string.
- We can therefore witness O(1) by giving, for each type t∈T, a small boundary interface consisting of four outputs:
  • pref2(t) ∈ Σ_out^2 for the first two nodes of rep(t), and
  • suff2(t) ∈ Σ_out^2 for the last two nodes of rep(t),
  such that (a) the boundary quadruple (pref2(t), suff2(t)) is in R_{rep(t)}, and (b) the “join” edge (suff2(t)[2], pref2(t)[1]) lies in C_out–out so two adjacent copies can be glued. This captures the periodic tiling constraint without spelling the whole interior.
- This is sufficient for the two obligations in the paper’s feasible function for O(1):
  (i) Tiling consistency: For each t, existence of (pref2,suff2) in R_{rep(t)} with (suff2[2],pref2[1]) allowed ensures that arbitrarily many copies of rep(t) can be locally labeled so that all nodes in the interior copies are locally consistent. We do not need to fix the interior outputs; Summ(rep(t)) witnesses their existence.
  (ii) Bridging through any S: For t1,t2 and any middle S (represented by some tS), we look only at the last 2 outputs of the block to the left and first 2 outputs of the block to the right. Those are suff2(t1) and pref2(t2). The existence of a consistent labeling of S is exactly: pick Summ(rep(tS)) and check whether ∃(o1,o2,o3,o4)∈R_{rep(tS)} with (suff2(t1)[2], o1)∈C_out–out and (o4,pref2(t2)[1])∈C_out–out. This is the same pattern as in the o(n) verifier.
- NEXPTIME procedure (stage 2):
  1) Reuse T and Summ(rep(t)).
  2) Nondeterministically guess, for each t ∈ T, two 2-tuples pref2(t), suff2(t) ∈ Σ_out^2. Certificate size: |T|·4·logβ = 2^{poly(N)} bits.
  3) Deterministically verify:
     (a) For all t: (pref2(t)[1], pref2(t)[2], suff2(t)[1], suff2(t)[2]) ∈ R_{rep(t)} and (suff2(t)[2], pref2(t)[1]) ∈ C_out–out.
     (b) For all t1,t2 and for all tS ∈ T ∪ {empty} (we handle S=∅ by a direct edge check): compute R_{rep(tS)} and check ∃(o1,o2,o3,o4)∈R_{rep(tS)} with (suff2(t1)[2], o1) and (o4, pref2(t2)[1]) in C_out–out. (As in the paper, only representatives of each type need to be tested.)
  4) If all pass, output O(1); else Ω(log* n).
- Correctness intuition: This compresses the paper’s function g (which labeled entire w) to only its boundary interface. Existence of interior labelings is furnished by the type summaries R and concatenation checking; the O(1) construction in Lemma 27 never needs to commit to specific interior outputs ahead of time, only to consistent boundary interfaces. The MIS-free decomposition of cycles into repetitive segments is emulated here by universal checks over types tS capturing all patterns of S.
- Complexity: Step (2) guessing takes 2^{poly(N)} bits/time. Step (3) checks |T| + |T|^2·|T| = |T|^3 = 2^{poly(N)} cases, each a poly(β) lookup, so 2^{poly(N)} time. Thus the O(1) vs Ω(log* n) decision is in NEXPTIME.
- How it can fail: We rely on the boundary-only witness (pref2,suff2) being sufficient for tiling; if C_out–out had longer-range dependencies, this would fail, but our LCL is radius-1, so only immediate neighbors matter. Quick test: with C_out–out equal to equality of outputs (proper 1D “matching”), pref2/suff2 must match at the join, and R_{rep(t)} enforces internal equalities; the checker’s conditions reduce to expected constraints and accept exactly the O(1) cases.

Putting it all together: full NEXPTIME classification
- Preprocessing (deterministic EXPTIME): enumerate T, representatives rep(t), and Summ(rep(t)).
- Stage 2 (NEXPTIME): Guess boundary interfaces (pref2,suff2) per type and verify O(1) via the conditions above. If pass, answer O(1).
- Stage 1 (NEXPTIME): Otherwise, guess feasible f on type triples and verify; if pass, answer Θ(log* n); else answer Θ(n).
- Overall: nondeterministic 2^{poly(N)} time and space. Witness sizes are capped at 2^{poly(N)}.

Sanity checks and small examples
- Example 1 (trivial always-accepting LCL): C_in–out ≡ Σ_out for both inputs; C_out–out ≡ Σ_out×Σ_out. Then the precomputed R_{rep(t)} are full Σ_out^4 for all t. Guess pref2,suff2 arbitrarily, all checks pass; we output O(1). 
- Example 2 (force global agreement on a secret): C_in–out allows any output, C_out–out forces the whole path to output the same color c (i.e., adjacency allowed only when equal). Our checker fails O(1) because bridging through an S with mismatched c cannot be met uniformly; then it fails log* via the feasible-f check since the middle block cannot enforce equality across adversarially chosen separators without long-range coordination; we output Θ(n).
- Example 3 (proper 2-coloring independent of inputs): C_in–out allows both colors irrespective of input; C_out–out forbids equal adjacent outputs. Our checker will fail O(1) (no boundary pair can be glued periodically because (last,first) must alternate), but succeed for log*: a feasible f exists assigning alternating labels on separators; output Θ(log* n).

Why the improvement over the naive “doubly exponential” approach
- The naive approach ranges over strings w of length ℓ_pump (which is ≈ |T| ≈ 2^{poly(N)}), causing double-exponential enumeration (2^{ℓ_pump}) to define/verify feasible functions.
- Our approach works purely at the type level. The number of types is τ ≤ 2^{poly(N)}, and all witnesses (pref2/suff2 per type; or f on type triples) are of size polynomial in τ, thus 2^{poly(N)}. All universal verifications iterate over O(τ^k) combinations and use polynomial-time (in β) composition/DP, yielding nondeterministic 2^{poly(N)} time overall.

Dependencies on path vs cycle and reversals
- We explicitly target globally oriented paths; no reversal options are needed in the feasible-f definition (simplifies verification). The same machinery supports cycles by adding the reversal choice as in the paper, at a constant multiplicative factor.

Potential refinements and open items
- Tighten composition: We can speed up concatenation by precomputing 3D tensors to reduce O(β^8) to O(β^6) per composition via semiring convolution; not essential for complexity class.
- Proof polishing for O(1) stage: We sketched sufficiency of boundary interfaces; to make it watertight, formalize that every use of repeated blocks in Lemma 27 only needs (i) existence of internal completions consistent with fixed 2-node boundary, and (ii) a valid join edge between adjacent copies. Both are exactly our checks.
- Memory model: The algorithm stores τ many β^4-bit tables (R relations). This is 2^{poly(N)} space; acceptable for complexity theory, but huge in practice. Possible compression: store only sets of allowed pairs for each marginal (e.g., precompute allowed (o2,o3) pairs) to exploit sparsity in C_out–out.

## Round 0001 — 2025-08-27T10:32:01.431305Z

Mini-plan
- Specialize the feasible-function framework of the paper to radius-1, β-normalized LCLs on globally oriented paths, and isolate a finite-state summary (types) that is exponential but not doubly exponential in β.
- Show we can deterministically compute all reachable types and a successor function δ(Type, bit) in time 2^{poly(β)} by dynamic programming on boundary-extendibility tables.
- Define, for each type t, a macro relation R_t ⊆ Σ_out × Σ_out that summarizes “what boundary output labels can be bridged across a block of type t”.
- Give a NEXPTIME (indeed EXPTIME) decision procedure for the ω(log* n)—o(n) gap by nondeterministically guessing a small table F on contexts of the form (leftType, 2-bit S, rightType) and verifying extendibility using the R_t relations.
- Give a NEXPTIME decision procedure for the ω(1)—o(log* n) gap by nondeterministically guessing boundary quadruples per type (first/second/second-last/last outputs) and verifying the wrap-around and bridging conditions via R_t and local checks.
- Validate with toy examples and note failure modes; identify concrete next steps to formalize the type-update computation and the verification routines.

Context and notation (radius 1, β-normalized)
- Inputs: Σ_in = {0,1}. Outputs: Σ_out with |Σ_out| = β. Legality: (in, out) ∈ C_in–out and (out, out′) ∈ C_out–out on each directed edge.
- Let E ⊆ Σ_out × Σ_out denote the directed edge relation from C_out–out. Let A_0, A_1 ⊆ Σ_out denote allowed outputs per input bit (rows of C_in–out).
- For a (long) input block P (string over {0,1}), write its type Type(P) as in the paper: r = 1 ⇒ D1 are the two endpoints; D2 are their immediate neighbors; extendibility is captured by which assignments of output labels to the four boundary nodes D1 ∪ D2 can be extended to a full legal labeling on the interior D3.

Claim 1 (Type-count bound specialized to r = 1)
Statement. The number of distinct types (equivalence classes ⋆∼) is at most ℓ_pump ≤ 16 · 2^{β^4}.
Why useful here. This bounds the state space of our finite abstraction by a single-exponential function of β, enabling 2^{poly(β)} algorithms.
Sketch. For r = 1, D1 ∪ D2 contains 4 boundary nodes. There are 2^4 choices of boundary input bits. For each, the extendibility predicate is a Boolean function over assignments of 4 boundary output labels, i.e., a subset of Σ_out^4, hence at most 2^{β^4} possibilities. Multiplying gives ≤ 16 · 2^{β^4}.
How it can fail. If radius r > 1 were needed, the exponent would grow as β^{4r}, but still single-exponential for constant r. No failure for r=1.
Quick test. With β=2, bound is 16·2^{16} ≈ 1M types (a rough upper bound); fine for theoretical complexity, impractical to enumerate in practice but enough for 2^{poly(β)} complexity.

Claim 2 (Deterministically computing all reachable types and δ in 2^{poly(β)} time)
Statement. We can compute the set T of all types reachable from length-≤4 words under appending bits, together with a deterministic successor function δ: T × {0,1} → T, in deterministic time 2^{poly(β)}.
Why useful here. Avoids enumerating 2^{ℓ_pump} strings. Once T and δ are known, all further checks quantify only over T (singly exponential), not over words (doubly exponential).
Construction and verification.
- Represent a type t ∈ T by (Lbits, Rbits, Ext_t), where Lbits, Rbits ∈ {0,1}^2 are the 2-bit prefix/suffix of any representative, and Ext_t ⊆ Σ_out^4 is the set of boundary 4-tuples (o_L1, o_L2, o_R2, o_R1) that are extendible to a full legal labeling inside.
- Initialization. Enumerate all input strings P of length k ∈ {1,2,3,4} (≤ 16 of them). For each, compute Ext_{Type(P)} exactly by dynamic programming on the tiny interior: enumerate all 4-tuples of boundary outputs consistent with C_in–out on boundary nodes and E on boundary edges; check extendibility of the (empty or short) interior by brute force (cost β^{O(4)} per P). Insert the resulting canonical type into a dictionary keyed by (Lbits, Rbits, Ext_t).
- Update (δ). Given t = (Lbits, Rbits, Ext_t) and a ∈ {0,1}, we can compute t′ = δ(t, a) as follows: t′ has Lbits′ = first two bits of (Lbits concatenated if current length<2 else unchanged), Rbits′ = updated last-two-bits after appending a, and Ext_{t′} is obtained by a constant-size “boundary-augmentation” DP: a boundary 4-tuple (o_L1, o_L2, o_R2′, o_R1′) is in Ext_{t′} iff there exist o_R2, o_R1 and an output label o_new for the appended node such that
  (i) (o_L1, o_L2, o_R2, o_R1) ∈ Ext_t,
  (ii) membership constraints at the new last node: o_new ∈ A_a,
  (iii) E-edges: (o_R1, o_new) ∈ E, and then set o_R2′=o_new (the new second-last), o_R1′ = ?
  Careful: after appending one node, the new last two boundary outputs are (old last, new), so interpret indexes accordingly. Full derivation requires casework for short representatives (k < 4), but all cases are constant and handled locally.
- BFS enumeration. Starting from the set of types derived for k ≤ 4, add δ(t,0) and δ(t,1) for each discovered t until closure. Each δ-computation runs in β^{O(4)} time (constant-factor DP over Σ_out^4). The number of types discovered is ≤ ℓ_pump. Thus total time ≤ ℓ_pump · poly(β) = 2^{poly(β)}.
How it can fail. The update must be consistent for small-k degeneracies (k < 4) where D1∪D2 overlaps; if mishandled, one might compute inconsistent Ext sets. We mitigate by bootstrapping directly from exact computation for k ≤ 4 and carefully distinguishing cases in the update.
Quick test. For a trivial LCL where E is complete and A_0=A_1=Σ_out, Ext_t=Σ_out^4 for all t. Then δ creates only 16 distinct types (Lbits,Rbits, full Ext). BFS closes after O(1) expansions—consistent and fast.

Claim 3 (Macro bridging relation R_t)
Statement. For each type t, we can compute a relation R_t ⊆ Σ_out × Σ_out such that (x, y) ∈ R_t iff there exists a legal labeling of some block P of type t that bridges the outer boundary labels x → y, in the sense: there exist boundary outputs (o_L1,o_L2,o_R2,o_R1) ∈ Ext_t with E-edges (x, o_L1) and (o_R1, y).
Why useful here. R_t summarizes the net effect of an unlabeled block of type t on the neighboring outside outputs. It collapses an entire block to a β×β boolean matrix for later composition checks.
Computation. For each t and each (x,y) ∈ Σ_out^2, test whether ∃ (o_L1,o_L2,o_R2,o_R1) ∈ Ext_t such that (x, o_L1) ∈ E and (o_R1, y) ∈ E. This costs O(β^4) per (x,y), hence O(β^6) per t.
How it can fail. If we misinterpret boundary directions (left/right), the composition in later checks breaks. We fix orientation globally: x is the output immediately before the block on the left, y is the output immediately after the block on the right.
Quick test. If E has a self-loop at c and c ∈ A_0∩A_1 at all boundary nodes, then (c,c) ∈ R_t for all t, since boundary tuple (c,c,c,c) is valid: sanity check.

Claim 4 (NEXPTIME decision for ω(log* n)—o(n): existence of a context-local f on 2-node windows)
Statement. There is a nondeterministic algorithm running in time 2^{poly(β)} that decides whether a feasible function f (in the sense of Section 4.2 of the paper) exists; equivalently, whether the LCL has deterministic LOCAL complexity o(n) instead of Ω(n).
Why useful here. This separates Ω(n) from o(n) in NEXPTIME, as requested.
Definition (specialized). For r=1, f takes as input a triple (t_L, S, t_R) where t_L, t_R ∈ T are types of the left/right contexts, and S ∈ {0,1}^2 is the 2-bit middle window; f outputs L_S ∈ Σ_out^2 for S, with (i) (S[1], L_S[1]) ∈ C_in–out, (S[2], L_S[2]) ∈ C_in–out, and (ii) (L_S[1], L_S[2]) ∈ E.
Verification condition (extendibility). For all quadruples (t_a, t_b, t_c, t_d) ∈ T^4, there exist orientation choices for S1,S2 (i.e., optionally reverse them; this toggles which side of L_S we use as boundary) such that, writing s1_last as the output of the last node of S1 under f and s2_first as the output of the first node of S2 under f, we have
  ∃ m ∈ Σ_out: (s1_last, m) ∈ R_{t_b} and (m, s2_first) ∈ R_{t_c}.
Algorithm.
1) Deterministically compute T, δ, and all R_t (Claim 2 and 3) in 2^{poly(β)} time.
2) Nondeterministically guess a table F: T × {0,1}^2 × T → Σ_out^2 assigning outputs to the 2-node window for every context. Enforce local per-node legality and (L_S[1],L_S[2]) ∈ E.
3) Deterministically verify the extendibility condition above for all |T|^4 quadruples (trying the 4 orientation choices for S1,S2 and scanning m ∈ Σ_out).
Complexity. |T| ≤ ℓ_pump ≤ 16·2^{β^4}. Step 3 costs O(|T|^4 · β), hence 2^{poly(β)}. The guess size |F| is |T|^2·4 entries, each an ordered pair in Σ_out^2: total certificate size 2^{poly(β)}.
Correctness sketch. This is the paper’s feasible-function notion specialized to r=1; replace arbitrary words by their types (Lemma 10/11), and label only the 2-node windows. The R_t composition exactly captures the existence of fillings for the unlabeled blocks w_b and w_c between S1 and S2. If such F exists, the o(n) construction of Section 4.2 yields an O(log* n)-round algorithm; if not, the problem has complexity Ω(n).
How it can fail. Two pitfalls: (i) Orientation/reversal: when we choose to label S1 or SR_1 we must use the appropriate context (swap t_a and t_b, and reverse the 2-bit S; our check enumerates both options). (ii) Using types: one must ensure the type-invariance lemma (Lemma 10/11) applies; here it does, since we only rely on boundary extendibility.
Quick test. Consider an LCL where A_0 ∩ A_1 = ∅ and E disallows any edge between outputs allowed by 0 and those by 1. Then R_t is empty whenever the block contains both 0 and 1 near its boundary, and no F can satisfy the bridging, so we correctly conclude Ω(n).

Claim 5 (NEXPTIME decision for ω(1)—o(log* n): existence of wrap-around boundary quadruples per type)
Statement. There is a nondeterministic algorithm running in time 2^{poly(β)} that decides whether the LCL has complexity O(1) vs Ω(log* n), assuming it is o(n) (i.e., Claim 4’s test passed).
Why useful here. This separates the two sublinear regimes in NEXPTIME, completing the trichotomy decision.
Witness to guess.
- For each type t ∈ T, guess a boundary quadruple Q_t = (L1_t, L2_t, R2_t, R1_t) ∈ Σ_out^4 intended to be the outputs on the first two and last two nodes of any block labeled by the constant-time scheme (cf. Section 4.4 of the paper).
- Reuse the table F from Claim 4 (or guess a fresh f for 2-node windows; both lead to 2^{poly(β)} guesses).
Checks.
(i) Local and wrap-around validity per type. For each t with boundary input bits (ℓ1,ℓ2) at the left and (r2,r1) at the right, enforce
  - L1_t ∈ A_{ℓ1}, L2_t ∈ A_{ℓ2}, R2_t ∈ A_{r2}, R1_t ∈ A_{r1};
  - (L1_t, L2_t) ∈ E, (R2_t, R1_t) ∈ E;
  - (L1_t, L2_t, R2_t, R1_t) ∈ Ext_t (so the interior is fillable);
  - wrap-around across repetitions: (R1_t, L1_t) ∈ E.
(ii) Bridging via 2-node windows. For all pairs (t_b, t_c) ∈ T^2 and for all S ∈ {00,01,10,11}, there exist 2-node outputs L_S (these can be taken from F(t_b, S, t_c) if we reuse F) satisfying per-node legality and (L_S[1], L_S[2]) ∈ E, such that
  ∃ m ∈ Σ_out: (R1_{t_b}, m) ∈ R_{t_b} and (m, L1_{t_c}) ∈ R_{t_c}, with the boundaries of S chosen appropriately (last of S feeds into t_b, first of S feeds from t_c). Equivalently, there exists a labeling of S whose last/first outputs connect to the block boundary outputs via R_{t_b} and R_{t_c}.
Complexity. The number of checks is O(|T| + |T|^2·4) = 2^{poly(β)}. Each check costs poly(β). Guess size is O(|T|·log β^4) plus the 2-node window table as in Claim 4.
Correctness sketch. This mirrors Section 4.4–4.5: the quadruple Q_t guarantees we can tile long periodic parts by repeating the chosen boundary scheme (wrap-around holds), and the 2-node windows with F stitch the remaining short/irregular parts. The R_t matrices certify fillability of the unlabeled blocks adjacent to the 2-node windows. If such witnesses exist, the O(1)-round construction follows; otherwise Ω(log* n).
How it can fail. Subtlety: for very short representatives (length < 4), Ext_t must be computed accurately so that (L1_t, L2_t, R2_t, R1_t) ∈ Ext_t truly guarantees interior extendibility. This is covered by the initialization in Claim 2.
Quick test. Suppose E has a self-loop at c and c ∈ A_0 ∩ A_1. Pick Q_t = (c,c,c,c) for all t and L_S = (c,c) for all S. Then all constraints pass, classifying the problem as O(1), which is correct (output c everywhere).

Toy examples
- Example A (No constant-time solution, Ω(n)). Let β=2, Σ_out={a,b}, A_0={a}, A_1={b}, and E = {(a,b), (b,a)} (alternating). Then any legal labeling forces alternation matching the input’s parity; stitching arbitrary 2-node windows across arbitrary blocks fails because R_t is empty for many contexts. Claim 4 rejects F, giving Ω(n).
- Example B (Constant-time trivial). Let A_0 = A_1 = Σ_out and E complete. Then O(1) holds with Q_t=(a,a,a,a) and L_S=(a,a) (for any fixed a). Claims 4 and 5 accept.

Why the naive algorithm is doubly exponential and how we avoid it
- Naively, checking feasibility would range over all words w with |w| ≤ ℓ_pump; since ℓ_pump itself is exponential in β, the total number of words is doubly exponential in β. The paper’s decidability argument (“feasible function exists”) is based on types but, if implemented by enumerating domain strings of f, becomes 2^{2^{poly(β)}}.
- Our approach collapses all universal quantification over words to universal quantification over types, whose number is ℓ_pump ≤ 2^{poly(β)}. All witnesses (F, boundary quadruples) are tables indexed by types (and the 4 possible 2-bit S), of size 2^{poly(β)}. All checks boil down to iterating over |T|^{O(1)} combinations and scanning β-sized alphabets—total time 2^{poly(β)}.
- Moreover, computing T and δ deterministically by DP on boundary-extendibility tables avoids guessing exponentially many representatives.

Complexity summary (in terms of input size N = poly(β))
- Compute T, δ, Ext_t, and R_t: time 2^{poly(β)} = 2^{poly(N)}.
- Stage 1 (Ω(n) vs o(n)): nondeterministically guess F of size 2^{poly(N)} and verify in time 2^{poly(N)}.
- Stage 2 (O(1) vs Ω(log* n)): nondeterministically guess Q_t (and optionally reuse F) of size 2^{poly(N)} and verify in time 2^{poly(N)}.
Hence: a NEXPTIME (indeed EXPTIME) trichotomy decision procedure for β-normalized, radius-1 LCLs on globally oriented paths.

Limits and open technical points (to be finalized)
- Type update (δ) for short representatives. We outlined casework; formalizing the exact DP for k ∈ {1,2,3} is needed to ensure correctness at the base.
- Reversal handling. When allowing reversed 2-node windows, we must consistently use the reversed type t^R (swap L/R bits and reverse boundary order). Precomputing t ↦ t^R is straightforward from Ext_t.
- Proof detail that the chosen Q_t and F suffice to reconstruct the O(1) algorithm exactly as in the paper’s Section 4.5. Our checks mirror their feasible-function definition; we will write the full reduction argument for completeness.

Next concrete steps
- Formalize the dynamic programming that computes Ext_{t′} from Ext_t and a new bit a (cleanly handling all small-k cases), and write a proof of its correctness (specialized Lemma 12 made algorithmic).
- Implement the computation of T, δ and R_t (pseudo-code sketch), and quantify exact polynomial exponents in β for time/memory.
- Write the precise verification routines for Stage 1 and Stage 2, including the reversal operator on types and on the 2-node window table F.
- Exercise the routines on a few canonical LCLs (e.g., 2-coloring over oriented paths, trivial constant labeling, parity constraints) to sanity-check the checks.

## round-0001 — model summary — 2025-08-27T11:03:04.494639Z
This round specialized the paper's feasible-function framework to radius-1, β-normalized LCLs on globally oriented paths and developed an explicit single-exponential finite-state abstraction (types). We proved a type-count bound |T| ≤ 16·2^{β^4}, gave a deterministic DP to enumerate reachable types and compute the append-one-bit successor δ in time 2^{poly(β)}, and defined per-type macro relations R_t summarizing how a block bridges outside outputs. Using these primitives we sketched NEXPTIME verifiers: (i) guess a type-indexed feasible function F to separate Ω(n) vs o(n); (ii) guess per-type boundary quadruples Q_t to separate O(1) vs Ω(log* n). The Verifier flagged a critical soundness gap: naive composition of R_t via an intermediate label m is unsound — one must compute concatenated summaries (Ext) and derive R for the concatenation (a small 3-color counterexample demonstrates the failure). Next steps are to formalize/correct δ, fix bridging composition, and prove the boundary-interface witness equivalence.

Corrections and key lemmas to record

1) Correct append-one-bit recurrence (r=1)
Given a type t with Ext_t ⊆ Σ_out^4 over boundary (L1,L2,R2,R1) and an appended input bit a, the new type t′ has boundary (L1′,L2′,R2′,R1′) = (L1,L2, old R1, new), i.e., R2′ = R1 and R1′ is the label of the appended node. Formally, for each candidate quadruple (x1,x2,x3,x4) ∈ Σ_out^4,
  (x1,x2,x3,x4) ∈ Ext_{t′} ⇔ [x4 ∈ A_a and E(x3,x4) and ∃ z ∈ Σ_out: (x1,x2,z,x3) ∈ Ext_t].
This yields an O(β^5) DP to fill Ext_{t′} by scanning all (x1,x2,x3,x4) and checking ∃z.

Congruence lemma (needed): If Type(P)=Type(Q), then for all a ∈ {0,1}, Type(Pa)=Type(Qa). Proof sketch: The predicate “there exists an interior completion consistent with boundary assignments” over D1∪D2 is preserved under appending one node by the above DP rule, which depends only on Ext_t and a.

2) Concatenation of summaries (r=1)
If Summ(P) has Ext_P and Summ(Q) has Ext_Q, then the concatenation B=P·Q has boundary (P.left endpoint, P.left neighbor, Q.right neighbor, Q.right endpoint) and
  (o1,o2,o3′,o4′) ∈ Ext_B ⇔ ∃ x3,x4,x1′,x2′ ∈ Σ_out: (o1,o2,x3,x4) ∈ Ext_P, (x1′,x2′,o3′,o4′) ∈ Ext_Q, and E(x4,x1′).
Then R_B can be derived from Ext_B as usual.

3) Counterexample to R-composition via ∃m
Let Σ_out={a,b,c}, A_0=A_1=Σ_out. Let E={a→b, b→c} only. Suppose t_b admits a boundary tuple with right endpoint a, and t_c admits a boundary tuple with left endpoint c (interiors arbitrary but extendible). Then choose m=b. We have (x,m) ∈ R_{t_b} for any x with a valid left edge, and (m,y) ∈ R_{t_c} for suitable y. But the concatenation t_b·t_c requires the seam edge a→c, which is forbidden. Hence ∃m composition of R_t is not sound; use Ext-level concatenation and R_B instead.

Abstract. Consider a computer network that consists of a path with n nodes. The
nodes are labeled with inputs from a constant-sized set, and the task is to ﬁnd output
labels from a constant-sized set subject to some local constraints—more formally, we
have an LCL (locally checkable labeling) problem. How many communication rounds
are needed (in the standard LOCAL model of computing) to solve this problem?
It is well known that the answer is always either O(1) rounds, or Θ(log∗n) rounds,
or Θ(n) rounds. In this work we show that this question is decidable (albeit PSPACE-
hard): we present an algorithm that, given any LCL problem deﬁned on a path,
outputs the distributed computational complexity of this problem and the corresponding
asymptotically optimal algorithm.

Introduction
To what extent is it possible to automate the design of algorithms and the study of computational
complexity? While algorithm synthesis problems are typically undecidable, there are areas of
theoretical computer science in which we can make use of computational techniques in algorithm
design—at least in principle, and sometimes also in practice. One such area is the theory of
distributed computing; see [3, 5, 6, 9, 11, 17, 19, 26] for examples of recent success stories. In this
work we bring yet another piece of good news:
Consider this setting: there is a computer network that consists of a path with n nodes, the
nodes are labeled with inputs from a constant-sized set, and the task is to ﬁnd output labels from
a constant-sized set subject to some local constraints. We show that for any given set of local
constraints, it is decidable to tell what is the asymptotically optimal number of communication
rounds needed to solve this problem (as a function of n, for the worst-case input).
Background: LCLs and the LOCAL Model.
We focus on what are known as LCL (locally
checkable labeling) problems [22] in the LOCAL model of distributed computing [20, 24]. We deﬁne
the setting formally in Section 2, but in essence we look at the following question:
• We are given an unknown input graph of maximum degree ∆= O(1); the nodes are labeled
with input labels from a constant-size set Σin, and the nodes also have unique identiﬁers from
a polynomially-sized set.
• The task is to label the nodes with output labels from a constant-size set Σout, subject to
some local constraints P; a labeling is globally feasible if it is locally feasible in all radius-r
neighborhoods for some r = O(1).
• Each node has to produce its own output label based on the information that it sees in its
own radius-T(n) neighborhoods for some function T.
Here the local constraints P deﬁne an LCL problem. The rule that the nodes apply to determine
their output labels is called a distributed algorithm in the LOCAL model, and function T(n) is the
running time of the algorithm—here T(n) determines how far a node has to see in order to choose
its own part of the solution, or equivalently, how many communication rounds are needed for each
node to gather the relevant information if we view the input graph as a communication network.
In this setting, the case of T(n) = Θ(n) is trivial, as all nodes can see the entire input. The
key question is to determine which problems P can be solved in sublinear time—here are some
examples:
• Vertex coloring with ∆+ 1 colors: can be solved in time O(log∗n) [8, 16] and this is tight
[20, 21].
• Vertex coloring with ∆colors, for ∆> 2: can be solved in polylogarithmic time [23] and
requires at least logarithmic time [7] for deterministic algorithms.
While the study of this setting was initiated already in the seminal work by Naor and Stockmeyer
in 1995 [22], our understanding of these questions has rapidly advanced in the past three years
[1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 12–15, 25]. The big surprises have been these:
1

--- Page 3 ---
• There are LCL problems with inﬁnitely many diﬀerent time complexities—for example, we
can construct LCL problems with a time complexity exactly Θ(nα) for any rational number
0 < α ≤1.
• Nevertheless, there are also wide gaps in the complexity landscape: for example, no LCL
problem has a (deterministic) computational complexity that is between ω(log∗n) and o(log n).
However, what is perhaps most relevant for us is the following observation: if we look at the case
of ∆= 2 (paths and cycles), then the time complexity of any LCL problem is either O(1), Θ(log∗n),
or Θ(n), and the same holds for both deterministic and randomized algorithms [5, 6, 22].
Decidability of LCL Time Complexities.
For a ﬁxed ∆, any LCL problem has a trivial ﬁnite
representation: simply enumerate all feasible radius-r local neighborhoods. Hence it makes sense to
ask whether, given an LCL problem, it is possible to determine its time complexity. The following
results are known by prior work:
• If the input graph is an unlabeled path or cycle, the time complexity is decidable [5, 22].
• If the input graph is a grid or toroidal grid, the time complexity is undecidable [22]. However,
there are also some good news: in unlabeled toroidal grids, the time complexity falls in one of
the classes O(1), Θ(log∗n), or Θ(n), it is trivial to tell if the time complexity is O(1), and it
is semi-decidable to tell if it is Θ(log∗n) [5].
• In the case of trees, there are inﬁnitely many diﬀerent time complexities, but there is a gap
between ω(log n) and no(1), and it is decidable to tell on which side of the gap a given problem
lies [6].
Somewhat surprisingly, the seemingly simple case of labeled paths or cycles has remained open all
the way since the 1995 paper by Naor and Stockmeyer [22], which deﬁned LCLs with inputs but
analyzed decidability questions only in the case of unlabeled graphs.
We initially expected that the question of paths with input labels is a mere technicality and the
interesting open questions are related to much broader graph families, such as rooted trees, trees,
and bounded-treewidth graphs. However, it turned out that the main obstacle for understanding
decidability in any such graph family seems to lie in the fact that the structure of the graph can be
used to encode arbitrary input labels, hence it is necessary to ﬁrst understand how the input labels
inﬂuence decidability—and it turns out that this makes all the diﬀerence in the case of paths.
In this work we show that the time complexity of a given LCL problem on labeled paths or
cycles is decidable. However, we also show that decidability is far from trivial: the problem is
PSPACE-hard, as LCL problems on labeled paths are expressive enough to capture linear bounded
automata (Turing machines with bounded tapes).

Model
The LOCAL Model.
The model of computation we consider in this work is the LOCAL model of
distributed computing [20, 24]. In the LOCAL model, each node of the input graph is considered as
a computational entity that can communicate with the neighboring nodes in order to solve some
given graph problem. Computation is divided into synchronous rounds, where in each round each
node ﬁrst sends messages of arbitrary size to its neighbors, then receives the messages sent by
its neighbors, and ﬁnally performs some local computation of arbitrary complexity. Each node is
equipped with a globally unique identiﬁer (ID) which is simply a bit string of length O(log n), where
2

--- Page 4 ---
n denotes the number of nodes of the input graph. In the beginning of the computation, each node
is aware of its own ID, the number of nodes and the maximum degree ∆of the input graph, and
potentially some additional problem-speciﬁc input. Each node has to decide at some point that it
terminates, upon which it returns a local output and does not take part in any further computation;
the problem is solved correctly if the local outputs of all nodes together constitute a global output
that satisﬁes the output constraints of the given problem.
Each node executes the same algorithm; the running time of the distributed algorithm is the
number of rounds until the last node terminates. It is well known that, due to the unbounded
message sizes, an algorithm with runtime T(n) can be equivalently described as a function from
the set of all possible radius-T(n) neighborhoods to the set of allowed outputs. In other words, we
can assume that in a T(n)-round algorithm, each node ﬁrst gathers the topology of and the input
labels contained in its radius-T(n) neighborhood, and then decides on its output based solely on
the collected information.
Locally Checkable Labelings.
The class of problems we consider is locally checkable labeling
(LCL) problems [22]. LCL problems are deﬁned on graphs of bounded degree, i.e., we will assume
that ∆= O(1). Formally, an LCL problem is given by a ﬁnite input label set Σin, a ﬁnite output
label set Σout, an integer r, and a ﬁnite set C of graphs where every node is labeled with a pair
(ℓin, ℓout) ∈Σin × Σout and one node is marked (as the center). Each node of the input graph
is assigned an input label from Σin before the computation begins, and the global output of a
distributed algorithm is correct if the radius-r neighborhood of each node v, including the input
labels given to the contained nodes and the output labels returned by the contained nodes, is
isomorphic to an element of C where v corresponds to the node marked as the center.
In the case of directed paths as our class of input graphs, we are interested in identifying the
simplest possible form of LCL problems. For this purpose, we deﬁne β-normalized LCLs; these are
problems for which the input is just binary, and the size of the set of output labels is β. Moreover, the
solution can be checked at each node v by just inspecting the input and output of v, and, separately,
the output of v and the output of its predecessor. More formally, a β-normalized LCL problem is
given by ﬁnite input and output label sets Σin, Σout satisfying |Σin| = 2, |Σout| = β, a ﬁnite set
Cin −out of pairs (ℓin, ℓout) ∈Σin × Σout and a ﬁnite set Cout −out of pairs (ℓout, ℓ′
out) ∈Σout × Σout.
The global output of a distributed algorithm for the β-normalized LCL problem is correct if the
following hold:
• For each node v, we have (Input(v), Output(v)) ∈Cin −out, where Input(v) denotes the input
label of v, and Output(v) the output label of v.
• For each node v that has a predecessor, we have (Output(v), Output(u)) ∈Cout −out, where u is
the predecessor of v, and Output(v), Output(u) are the output labels of v and u, respectively.
It is straightforward to check that a β-normalized LCL problem is indeed a special case of an LCL
problem where r = 1.
3
Hardness
In this section we study the hardness of determining the distributed complexity of LCLs on paths
and cycles with input labels. More precisely, we start by proving the existence of a family Π of
LCL problems for consistently globally oriented paths, such that, given an LCL problem in Π, it is
PSPACE-hard to decide if its distributed complexity is O(1) or Θ(n). Our main result shows the
following.

Figure 1: Illustration of a correct encoding of the execution of an LBA on a path; black nodes act as separators
between the encoding of two consecutive steps of the LBA; in the example, the LBA executes a unary counter.
It is PSPACE-hard to distinguish whether a given LCL problem P with input labels can be
solved in O(1) time or needs Ω(n) time on globally oriented path graphs.
The high level idea of the proof of the above result is as follows. We would like to encode the
execution of Turing machines as LCLs on consistently oriented paths, and then deﬁne some LCL for
which the complexity depends on the running time of the machine. This is fairly easy on oriented
grids, for example, where we can use one dimension of the grid as a tape, and the other dimension
as time. One may try to do the same on paths, by projecting everything on a single dimension,
concatenating the tape state of each step. Unfortunately, the obtained encoding is not locally
checkable, since the length of the tape may be non-constant. Hence, in order to guarantee the local
checkability, we should consider Turing machines having a tape of size at most B, where B is a
constant with respect to the number of nodes in the path where we want to encode its execution.
For this purpose, we consider Linear Bounded Automata (LBA) [18, p. 225]. An LBA is a Turing
machine that has a tape of size upper bounded by some B. We show that, if B is constant with
respect to the number of nodes in the path, we can then encode the execution of an LBA MB as
an LCL for directed paths. Moreover, we show that by seeing this encoding as a two party game
between a prover and a disprover, we can encode the execution of MB using labels of constant size
that do not depend on B, even in the case in which the LCL checkability radius is 1. If the execution
of MB is not correctly encoded in the input of the LCL, then we can disprove its correctness using
output labels of size O(B). Moreover, we ensure that, if the execution of MB is correctly encoded
in the input of the LCL, it is not possible to produce a correct proof of non-correctness. Then, in
order to obtain an LCL with a distributed complexity that depends on the execution time of MB,
we encode some secret input at the ﬁrst node of the path. We require then that all nodes involved
in a correct encoding must produce the same secret as output.
Figure 1 shows an example of an LBA that executes a unary counter, and its encoding as input
to nodes on a path. In this instance, all nodes must produce the symbol a as output. Figure 2 shows
an example of the wrong input (the tape has been copied incorrectly between two consecutive steps

of the LBA). In this case, nodes are allowed to produce a chain of errors. Diﬀerent types of errors
will be handled using diﬀerent types of error labels. In the example, all nodes that produce the
error chain, output E2, indicating an error of type 2. We will show that we need O(B) symbols to
handle all possible errors (including the case in which the input tape is too long, way more than B).
Also, it is necessary that all error chains that we allow as outputs must be locally checkable.
Another interesting problem is to identify, for an LCL that can be distributedly solved in constant
time, how big this constant can be. In particular, we ﬁrst focus on identifying the simplest possible
description of an LCL, and then, we provide a lower bound on the complexity of a constant time
LCL, as a function of the size of the LCL description. For this purpose, we consider β-normalized
LCLs, i.e., problems for which the input labeling is just binary and there are β possible output
labels. Also, the veriﬁer for these LCLs is the simplest possible: it can only check if the output of a
node is correct w.r.t. its input, and separately, if the output of a node is correct w.r.t. the output of
its predecessor. Therefore, we show how to convert an LCL to a β-normalized one by encoding the
input in binary (Figure 3 shows an example), and obtain the following result.
There are β-normalized LCLs that can be solved in constant time but the distributed time
complexity is 2Ω(β).
All results that we have been described so far apply to globally oriented paths. Nevertheless, we
show that ideas and techniques can be generalized to work on undirected path and cycles as well,
obtaining essentially the same results. Finally, we will show how to lift these results to trees without
input labels, proving the following result.
It is PSPACE-hard to distinguish whether a given LCL problem P without input labels can be
solved in O(1) time or needs Ω(n) time on trees with degree ∆= 3.

Linear Bounded Automata
A Linear Bounded Automata MB is a Turing Machine having a bounded tape of size at most B,
such that it is able to recognize the boundaries of the tape [18, p. 225]. More formally, we deﬁne an
LBA as a tuple of 5 elements M = (Q, q0, qf, Γ, δ), where
• Q is a ﬁnite set of states;
• q0 ∈Q is the initial state;
• qf ∈Q is the ﬁnal state;
• Γ is a ﬁnite set of tape alphabet symbols that contains integers 0, 1, and special symbols L
(left), and R (right);
• δ is the transition function, where δ: Q \ {qf} × Γ →Q × Γ × {−, ←, →}.
The tape of MB is initialized as follows:
• the ﬁrst cell is marked with the symbol L;
• the last cell is marked with the symbol R;
• all other cells contain an integer in {0, 1}.
An execution of an LBA is a sequence (stepi | i ∈{1, . . . , t}), where
• stepi = (statei, tapei, headi);
• statet = qf;
• δ(statei, tapei[headi]) = (statei+1, tapei+1[headi], ϵ), and headi+1 is
– headi −1 if ϵ is ←;
– headi if ϵ is −;
– headi + 1 if ϵ is →.
3.2
The LCL Problem
We deﬁne a family Π of LCLs, in which each problem ΠMB depends on the LBA MB. The general
idea is that the input of the LCL may encode the execution of an LBA MB. If it is the case, nodes
are required to solve a problem that requires a time proportional to the execution time of MB. On
the other hand, if it is not the case, nodes can produce an output that proves that this encoding is
wrong. In order to deﬁne valid LCLs, we consider the case where B = O(1), that is, the size of the
tape does not depend on the size of the distributed network.
3.2.1
Input Labels
We deﬁne the input labels of our LCL as follows:
• Start(φ), where φ ∈{a, b}, indicates a symbol that will be used as some kind of secret;
• Separator, a label that acts as a separator between two steps of MB;
• Tape(c, s, h) gives information about the tape and the state of MB, where the content c ∈
{0, 1, L, R}, the state s ∈Q, and the head h ∈{true, false};
• Empty, indicating an empty input.
Note that the size of the set of possible input labels does not depend on the size B of the tape.

3.2.2
Encoding an LBA on a Path
Suppose we have a consistent global orientation in the path P = (p0, p1, p2, . . . , pn−1). Let step =
 stepi = (statei, tapei, headi) | i ∈{1, . . . , t}

be the execution of the LBA MB starting from a tape
initialized with (L, 0, . . . , 0, R).
Deﬁnition 1. The input of the LCL is a good input if the ﬁrst node of the path has in input
Start(φ), where φ ∈{a, b}, and the rest of the path correctly encodes the execution of an LBA MB
initialized with (L, 0, . . . , 0, R) (see Figure 1). More precisely:
• Input(p0) = Start(φ);
• Input(p(i−1)(B+1)+1) = Separator for i ∈1, . . . , t;
• Input(p(i−1)(B+1)+1+j) = Tape(c, s, h) for i ∈1, . . . , t, j ∈{1, . . . , B}, where
– c = tapei[j];
– s = statei;
– h = true if headi = j, otherwise h = false;
• All other nodes have in input Empty.
3.2.3
Output Labels
The set of output labels is the following.
• Start(φ);
• Empty;
• Error: a generic error label;
• Error0(i) where 0 ≤i ≤B + 1: an error of type 0 indicating that the machine is not correctly
initialized;
• Error1(i), where 0 ≤i ≤B: an error of type 1 that we will use in the case where the size of
the tape is not correct, i.e., when the size of the tape is not B;
• Error2(x, i), where x ∈{0, 1, L, R} and 0 ≤i ≤B + 1: an error of type 2 used when the tape
of MB is wrongly copied;
• Error3: an error of type 3 is used in case nodes have inconsistent states;
• Error4(current state, tape content, i), where 0 ≤i ≤B + 2: an error of type 4 indicating that
the transition of MB is encoded incorrectly (this error captures also the case where the head
is missing);
• Error5(x) where x ∈{0, 1}: an error of type 5 used in the case when there is more than one
head.
3.2.4
LCL Constraints
The high level idea is the following. If the path encodes a good input, then nodes that are not
labeled Empty are required to output the input given to the ﬁrst node of the path (either a or b).
Otherwise, nodes can produce a locally checkable proof of an error (see Figure 2 for an example).
While nodes may output a or b even in the case in which the input is not a good input, nodes
must not be able to produce a proof error in the case in which the path encodes a good input. We
describe all these requirements as locally checkable constraints.
An output labeling for problem ΠMB is correct if the following conditions are satisﬁed for nodes
of the path P = (p0, . . . , pn−1). Note that, although nodes do not know their position on the path,
for the sake of simplicity we will denote with pi−1 the predecessor of pi, if it exists.

1. Each node v produces exactly one output label.
2. If Output(v) = Empty then Input(v) = Empty.
3. If v has no predecessors (i.e., v = p0) and Output(v) = Start(φ), then Input(v) = Start(φ).
4. If Output(pi−1) = a then Output(pi) ̸= b, and if Output(pi−1) = b then Output(pi) ̸= a.
5. If Output(pi) = Error0(j), then
• if j = 0 then the node has no predecessor;
• if j > 0 then Output(pi−1) = Error0(j −1).
6. If Output(pi) = Error1(j), then
• if j = 0, then Input(pi) = Separator;
• if j > 0 then Input(pi) ̸= Separator and Output(pi−1) = Error1(j −1).
7. If Output(pi) = Error2(x, j), then
• if j = 0, then Input(pi) = Tape(c, s, h) where h = false, c = x;
• if j = B + 1 then Input(pi) = Tape(c, s, h) where c ̸= x;
• if 0 < j < B + 1 then Output(pi−1) = Error2(x, j −1).
8. If Output(pi) = Error3, then Input(pi) = Tape(c, s, h), Input(pi−1) = Tape(c′, s′, h′), and s ̸= s′.
9. If Output(pi) = Error4(current state, tape content, j), let (transition state, new content, ϵ) =
δ(current state, tape content)
• if j = 0, then Input(pi) = Tape(c, s, h) where c = tape content, s = current state, h = true;
• if j = B and ϵ = ←, or j = B +1 and ϵ = −, or j = B +2 and ϵ = →(i.e., if node pi is an
“Error4 ﬁnal node”), then either current state is a ﬁnal state or Input(pi) = Tape(c, s, h)
where s ̸= transition state or h = false;
• otherwise, then Output(pi−1) = Error4(current state, tape content, j −1).
10. If Output(pi) = Error5(x)
• if Output(pi−1) ̸= Error5 then Input(pi) = Tape(c, s, h) where h = true and x = 0.
11. If Output(pi) = Error then one of the following condition holds:
• Input(pi) ̸= Start(φ) and pi has no predecessors;
• Input(pi) = Start(φ) and pi has a predecessor;
• Input(pi−1) or Output(pi−1) is Empty;
• Output(pi−1) = Error;
• Output(pi−1) = Error0(j), j > 0, and
– if j = 1 then Input(pi−1) ̸= Separator;
– if j ≥2 then either Input(pi−1) ̸= Tape, or Input(pi−1) = Tape(c, s, h) and:
∗if j = 2 either c ̸= L, or s ̸= q0 or h = false;
∗if 2 < j ≤B either c ̸= 0, or s ̸= q0 or h = true;

∗if j = B + 1, either c ̸= R, or s ̸= q0 or h = true;
• Input(pi) = Separator and Output(pi−1) = Error1(x) where x ̸= B;
• Input(pi) ̸= Separator and Output(pi−1) = Error1(B);
• Output(pi−1) = Error2(x, j) where j = B + 1;
• Output(pi−1) = Error3;
• pi−1 is an “Error4 ﬁnal node”;
• Output(pi−1) = Error5(x) and Input(pi−1) = Tape(c, s, h) where h = true and x = 1.
12. If Output(pi) is of type Errorx, then Output(pi−1) must not be of type Errory where y ̸= x.
The following property directly holds by deﬁnition of the constraints.
Property 1. Each node is able to locally check all constraints by just inspecting its own input and
output, and the ones of its predecessor (if it exists).
3.3
Upper Bound on the Complexity of the LCL
We need to consider two possible scenarios: either MB terminates within time T, or MB loops. In
the case in which MB loops, we show a simple O(n) algorithm that solves the LCL ΠMB. As we
know, any problem for which a solution exists can be solved in O(n) rounds in the LOCAL model by
gathering all the graph and solving the problem locally. There always exists a solution for problem
ΠMB if MB loops, in fact:
• If Input(p0) = Start(φ), then all nodes output φ, even if there are errors in the machine
encoding.
• Otherwise, if Input(p0) ̸= Start(φ), all nodes output Error.
It is easy to see that this output satisﬁes the LCL constraints described above.
Suppose that MB terminates. In this case, we show how to solve the LCL problem ΠMB in
constant time. More precisely, if MB terminates in T rounds, we show a distributed algorithm that
solves ΠMB in T ′ = 2+(B +1)T rounds. Each node v starts by gathering its T ′-radius neighborhood
Bv(T ′). Notice that, by deﬁnition, if the input is a good input, then for each node v that is taking
part in the encoding of the execution of MB (i.e., Input(v) ̸= Empty), Bv(T ′) contains p0. Hence, if
a node v does not see p0 after gathering its ball Bv(T ′), it means that the input is not a good input.
So, after gathering its T ′-radius ball, each node v does the following.
• If Input(v) = Empty, then Output(v) = Empty.
• If Bv(T ′) does not contain p0, or if Input(p0) ̸= Start(φ), then v outputs Error.
• If Bv(T ′) is a good input, then v outputs Start(φ).
The remaining case that we still need to handle is when Bv(T ′) contains p0, Input(p0) = Start(φ),
but Bv(T ′) does not look like a good input. We want nodes to produce a proof of an error in some
consistent way. Thus, we show that nodes can identify the ﬁrst error and produce a proof based on
that. First of all, notice that, since v sees the ﬁrst node in the path, v can compute its position i on
the path. Also, node v can identify who is the ﬁrst node u not satisfying the constraints of being a
good input. Let j be the position of u in the path, that is u = pj. Now we distinguish the following
cases based on Bu(B + 2) (the output of each node will be determined by the ﬁrst case encountered
in the following list).
9

--- Page 11 ---
1. If Input(pj) = Start(φ) and j ̸= 0, then, if i < j, Output(v) = Start(φ); otherwise Output(v) =
Error.
2. If j ≤B + 1, it means that either the initial state is encoded incorrectly, or the tape is not
initialized correctly, or the head is not initialized on the correct position. In this case, if i ≤j,
then Output(v) = Error0(i), otherwise Output(v) = Error.
3. If Input(pj−(B+1)) = Separator and Input(pj) ̸= Separator, then the length of the tape is too
long, and u expected to have in input Separator. Then, if i < j −(B +1), Output(v) = Start(φ);
if i > j then Output(v) = Error; otherwise, Output(v) = Error1(i −j + B + 1).
4. If Input(pj) = Separator and there exists a k such that 1 ≤j −k < B + 1 such that
Input(pk) = Separator, then the length of the tape is too short, and u did not expect to have a
separator. In this case, if i < k then Output(v) = Start(φ); if i ≥j then Output(v) = Error;
otherwise Output(v) = Error1(k −i).
5. If Input(pj−(B+1)) = Tape(c, s, h) where h = false, c = x, and Input(pj) = Tape(c′, s′, h′), where
c′ ̸= x, then the tape of MB has been copied incorrectly. In this case, if i < j −(B + 1), then
Output(v) = Start(φ); if i > j then Output(v) = Error; otherwise, Output(v) = Error2(x, i −j +
B + 1).
6. If Input(pj) = Tape(c, s, h) and Input(pj−1) = Separator and there exists a k < j + B such
that Input(pk) = Tape(c′, s′, h′) and that s ̸= s′, it means that nodes have inconsistent states.
Consider the minimum k satisfying the constraints. If i < k then Output(v) = Start(φ); if
i > k then Output(v) = Error; otherwise, Output(v) = Error3.
7. If none of the above is satisﬁed, it means that there exist a k satisfying j −k ≤B +2, such that
Input(pk) = Tape(c, s, h) and h = true. Let (transition state, new content, ϵ) = δ(s, c). It holds
that if ϵ is ←, −, or →, then j−k is respectively B, B+1, or B+2. If Input(pj) = Tape(c′, s′, h′),
where either h′ = false, or transition state ̸= s′, or s is a ﬁnal state, then there is some
error in the transition (this captures also the case where there is no head). If i < k, then
Output(v) = Start(φ); if i > j then Output(v) = Error; otherwise, Output(v) = Error4(s, c, k−i).
Notice that this case captures also the one where the head is missing.
8. If Input(pj) = Tape(c, s, h) where h = true, since all the above cases are not satisﬁed, it means
that there exists a k, such that Input(pk) = Tape(c′, s′, h′), h′ = true, |j −k| < B and all nodes
pmin(j,k), . . . , pmax(j,k) are labeled with some Tape. That is, there are at least two heads, one
on node pj and one on node pk. In this case, if i < min(j, k), then Output(v) = Start(φ); if
i > max(j, k) then Output(v) = Error; if i = min(j, k) then Output(v) = Error5(0), otherwise
Output(v) = Error5(1).
If the path encodes a good input, every node taking part in the encoding of the execution of MB
outputs Start(φ), and in this case it is easy to see that the output satisﬁes the LCL constraints.
Therefore, assume that the path does not correctly encode the execution of MB starting from
the correct tape content. First of all, notice that the algorithm handles all possible errors in the
machine encoding, that is, if the input is not good, at least one case of the list applies. Consider
all nodes v that do not have in input Empty, that is, all nodes taking part in the encoding of the
execution of MB. If node v sees the ﬁrst node p0, i.e., if the distance between p0 and v is at most
T ′ (notice that a good input has length T ′), then it is easy to see that the output satisﬁes the LCL
constraints. Some care is needed in the case where a node v outputs a generic error Error and v
does not see p0: we need to show that also in this case the output is valid, meaning that the LCL
10

--- Page 12 ---
constraints are satisﬁed. In this case, the distance between p0 and v is strictly greater than T ′, and
since the encoding of the execution of MB is not correct, then
• either the path (p0, . . . , v) does not correctly encode the execution of MB,
• or MB is not correctly initialized and it loops.
In the ﬁrst case, some node on the path between p0 and v will output some speciﬁc error Errorx where
x > 0, while in the second case initial nodes will output Error0. In both scenarios the constraints for
Error are satisﬁed. The complexity of the algorithm is O(B · T).
3.4
Lower Bound on the Complexity of the LCL
Let us deﬁne T ′′ as follows. If MB terminates in time T, then T ′′ = T ′ = 2 + (B + 1)T. If MB loops,
then T ′′ = n. We prove a lower bound on the complexity of ΠMB of Ω(T ′′) rounds, by showing that
Ω(T ′′) rounds are needed in the case where the input is a good input. In particular, we show that,
in a good input, for all nodes v such that Input(v) ̸= Empty, Output(v) must be Start(φ). The result
then comes from the fact that, for some nodes, it requires Ω(T ′′) rounds in order to see if φ = a or
φ = b.
First of all, we ignore nodes that have in input Empty since, in a good input, they are at distance
at least T ′′ + 1 from p0, the ﬁrst node of the path. Hence, assume that a node v not having Empty in
input does not output Start(φ). In this case, v can either output a generic error Error, or a speciﬁc
error Errorx. If all nodes output Error, the veriﬁer rejects on p0. If all nodes, starting from a node
pi where i > 0, output Error, and all nodes pi′ with i′ < i output Start(φ), then the veriﬁer rejects
on pi. Therefore, let us assume that there is at least a node that outputs a speciﬁc error Errorx. We
write succ(v) and dist(u, v) to denote respectively the successor of a node v in the path, and the
distance between two nodes u and v in the path.
• If x = 0, the veriﬁer accepts only if this error produces a chain that starts from p0 and
proceeds with increasing values. In order to be accepted, this chain must end at a node w′,
and succ(w′) must output Error. Then, succ(w′) must witness that w′ indeed has a local error
in the machine initialization, which is not possible in a good input.
• If x = 1, we could have two cases:
– there is a chain of increasing values that starts from a node w with Input(w) = Separator,
and ends on a node w′ such that dist(w, w′) < B, Input(succ(w′)) = Separator, and
Output(succ(w′)) = Error (the tape is too short);
– there is a chain of increasing values that starts from a node w with Input(w) = Separator,
and ends on a node w′ such that dist(w, w′) = B, Input(succ(w′)) ̸= Separator, and
Output(succ(w′)) = Error (the tape is too long).
Since, in a good input, the distance between two nodes having in input Separator is always
B + 1, the above scenarios are not possible.
• If x = 2, there must be a chain of length exactly B + 1, starting from a node w having
Input(w) = Tape(c, s, h), where c = x ∈{0, 1}, h = false, and ending on a node w′ such that
dist(w, w′) = B + 1, and Input(w′) = Tape(c′, s′, h′), where c′ ̸= x. In a good input, the tape
content of nodes w and w′ must be the same.
• If x = 3, it means that there must exist two neighbors having two diﬀerent states, and this
can not happen in a good input.
11

--- Page 13 ---
• If x = 4, there must be a chain that propagates the old state and old input, and the veriﬁer
accepts only if acknowledges that the transition has been wrongly encoded, which can not the
case in a good input.
• If x = 5, there must be a chain of length at least 2 not passing through nodes having in input
Separator, starting from a node w with Input(w) = Tape(c, s, h) where h = true, and ending
on a node w′ with Input(w′) = Tape(c′, s′, h′) where h′ = true. This is not possible on a good
input.
Therefore, since nodes can not output any kind of error, and since Empty is not a valid output for
the nodes encoding the LBA, then these nodes must output Start(φ), where the value of φ matches
the input of the ﬁrst node of the path. Hence, ΠMB requires Ω(T ′′).
3.5
Normalizing an LCL Problem
We now show how to β-normalize an LCL ΠMB and obtain a new LCL having roughly the same time
complexity. We deﬁne three diﬀerent veriﬁers depending on their view.
• A Vin,in −out,out veriﬁer running at node v, checks Input(v), Input(pred(v)), Output(v), and
Output((pred(v)).
• A Vin −out veriﬁer running at node v, checks Input(v) and Output(v).
• A Vout −out veriﬁer running at node v checks Output(v) and Output((pred(v)).
Lemma 2. Consider an LCL P with |ΣP
in| = α and |ΣP
out| = β that can be solved in time T and can
be locally checked with a Vin,in −out,out veriﬁer. It is possible to deﬁne an LCL P′ such that |ΣP′
in | = α
and |ΣP′
out| = α · β that can be solved in time T and can be locally checked with a Vin −out and a
Vout −out veriﬁer.
Proof. We deﬁne ΣP′
in = ΣP
in, and ΣP′
out = ΣP
out × ΣP
out. Let Output(v) = (in, out) ∈ΣP′
out. Let
Output(pred(v)) = (in′, out′) ∈ΣP′
out. The Vin −out veriﬁer checks that Input(v) = in. The Vout −out
veriﬁer acts the same as the Vin,in −out,out veriﬁer executed on ((in′, out′), (in, out)). The LCL problem
P′ can be solved with the following algorithm at each node v.
• Gather the ball Bv(T).
• Simulate the original algorithm on Bv(T); let out be the output of this simulation.
• Output (Input(v), out).
It is easy to check that this output is valid for the problem P′, and that it requires T rounds. Also,
note that it is not possible to solve P′ faster than T. In fact, in order to satisfy the Vin −out veriﬁer,
the input must be copied correctly; while in order to satisfy the Vout −out veriﬁer, we need to satisfy
the Vin,in −out,out veriﬁer executed giving the same input that it would have seen on P.
Lemma 3. Consider an LCL P with |ΣP
in| = α and |ΣP
out| = β that can be solved in time T and can
be locally checked with a Vin −out and a Vout −out veriﬁer. We can deﬁne a β′-normalized LCL P′
with β′ = |ΣP′
out| = 2γ · (|ΣP
out| + 3) that can be solved in time Θ(γ · T(n/γ)), where γ = 2⌈log α⌉+ 3.
Proof. In the following we will exploit the ability of an algorithm to work on identiﬁers that can
be polynomial in the size of the graph. In particular, we assume that if an algorithm works on an
instance with IDs in the range 1, . . . , r, then it works also on an instance with IDs in the range
1, . . . , γ · r. Then, we show how to deﬁne an LCL P′ such that:
• if the input instance encodes a virtual instance for the problem P, it is required to solve P on
the virtual instance;
12

--- Page 14 ---
• otherwise, it is required to prove that the encoding is wrong.
Let V′
in −out and V′
out −out be the veriﬁers of our β′-normalized LCL.
Encoding P in P′.
We start by deﬁning how to encode an instance of P of size n, as an
instance of P′ of size N = γ · n. We denote with p0, . . . , pn−1 and p′
0, . . . , p′
γ·n−1 respectively the
instance of P and the one of P′. Let a = ⌈log α⌉. For the sake of simplicity, let us rename nodes
p′
γi, . . . , p′
γ(i+1)−1, where 0 ≤i ≤n −1, as qi
0, . . . , qi
2a+2 (notice that 2a + 2 = γ −1). The ﬁrst a + 1
nodes, qi
0, . . . , qi
a, have input 1, while nodes qi
a+1 and qi
2a+2 have input 0. Each of the remaining a
nodes, qi
a+2, . . . , qi
2a+1, has in input one bit of the binary representation of Input(pi), in some ﬁxed
order (see Figure 3 for an illustration).
The V′
in −out Veriﬁer.
The set of output labels of P′ is ΣP′
out = 2γ × (Σout ∪{Er, E, El}). Let qi
j
be a node of the instance of P′ where 0 ≤i ≤n −1 and 0 ≤j ≤2a + 2. Let Input(qi
j) ∈{0, 1}, and
let Output(qi
j) = ((b0, . . . , b2a+2), out) ∈ΣP′
out. The V′
in −out veriﬁer running at qi
j checks that
• Input(qi
j) = b0, and
• if out ∈ΣP
out, then
– if all bits in b0, . . . , ba are 1s, checks that the original Vin −out veriﬁer accepts on
(x, out), where x is obtained by recovering the input pi for the original algorithm from
ba+2, . . . , b2a+1.
The V′
out −out Veriﬁer.
Let the output of pi
j be ((b0, . . . , b2a+2), out) ∈ΣP′
out and the output of
the predecessor of pi
j be ((b′
0, . . . , b′
2a+2), out′) ∈ΣP′
out The O-O veriﬁer ﬁrst checks that
• b0 = b′
1, b1 = b′
2, . . . , b2a+1 = b′
2a+2, and
• if out ∈ΣP
out and out′ ∈ΣP
out, then
– if at least one bit in b0, . . . , ba is 0 , then out = out′,
– if all bits in b0, . . . , ba are 1s, then check that the original Vout −out executed on (out′, out)
accepts.
Dealing with Errors.
We now add some constraints to handle the case in which out /∈
ΣP
out. Let the output of pi
j be ((b0, . . . , b2a+2), out) and the output of the predecessor of pi
j be
((b′
0, . . . , b′
2a+2), out′). The V′
in −out veriﬁer additionally checks that, if out = E, then the encoding is
not locally valid, that is,
• either
– there are two numbers x, y ≥0, x + y ≤a, such that b0, . . . , bx−1 and b2a+3−y, . . . , b2a+2
are all equal to 1, bx = 0, b2a+2−y = 0, and
– there is not a contiguous sequence of length a + 1 of all 1s in b0, . . . , b2a+2,
• or b0, . . . , ba are all 1s but either ba+1 ̸= 0 or b2a+2 ̸= 0.
The V′
out −out veriﬁer running on pi
j additionally checks that,
• if out = El, then pi
j must have a predecessor, and it must hold that out′ /∈{Er} ∪ΣP
out;
• if out ∈ΣP
out, if pi
j has a predecessor, then out′ must be diﬀerent from Er;
• if out = Er, then pi
j must have a successor.

Let N be the size of the graph. An algorithm solving P′ in (γ + 1) · T rounds does the following at
each node v′:
• Gather the ball Bv′((γ + 1) · T).
• If Bv′((γ + 1) · T) looks like a correct encoding of an input instance of P
– let u′ be the nearest left node having input 1 and other a successors, succ(1)u′, . . . , succ(a)u′,
having also input 1
– Compute the virtual instance for P (setting the IDs to be the same of the nodes satisfying
the above)
– Simulate the original algorithm on the virtual instance by setting n = N/γ, let out be
the output of u′
– Output ((Input(v′), Input(succ(1)v′), . . . , Input(succ(γ−1)v′), out)
• Otherwise,
– if there is a local error, output E
– if the nearest error is on the left, output El
– otherwise, output Er
It is easy to check that the output of the algorithm satisﬁes the constraints. In order to show a
lower bound for the new LCL, we now show that it is not possible to produce errors in a graph
that is a valid encoding. In fact, nodes can not cheat by wrongly outputting the input of the
neighbors, otherwise either the input-output veriﬁer notices inconsistencies on the ﬁrst bit, or the
output-output veriﬁer notices inconsistencies on the other bits. Then, on a valid encoding, no input
satisﬁes the constraints that allows to produce E as output. Finally, the constraints impose that a
chain of Er or El points to a node that is outputting E.
Note that, if the original LCL has complexity T, then the new LCL, on instances of size N = γ ·n,
has complexity Θ(γ(T(n))) = Θ(γ · T(N
γ )).

Hardness Results
Theorem 4. There are β-normalized LCLs that can be solved in constant time but the distributed
time complexity is 2Ω(β).
Proof. The complexity of ΠMB is Θ(B · T) if MB terminates in T steps.
|Σin| = O(1) and
|Σout| = Θ(B). We can convert it to an LCL where |Σin| = 2, |Σout| = Θ(B), and the complexity is
still Θ(B · T). There exist LBAs that terminate in 2Θ(B) steps (e.g. a binary counter). Thus, the
complexity of the obtained LCL is Θ(B · 2Θ(B)), that is 2Ω(B) = 2Ω(|Σout|) = 2Ω(β).
Theorem 5. It is PSPACE-hard to distinguish whether a given LCL problem P with input labels
can be solved in O(1) time or needs Ω(n) time on globally oriented path graphs.
Proof. It is PSPACE-hard to distinguish whether a given LBA terminates or loops (see e.g. [10]).
Note that the description of a β-normalized LCL has size O(β2). In order to decide if a β-normalized
version of a problem in Π requires O(1) or Ω(n) we need to decide if its associated LBA, running on
a tape of size B = Θ(β), terminates or loops, and this implies the theorem.

3.7
Extending the Results to Undirected Cycles
We show how to extend the above results, which apply to globally oriented paths, to the case where
the input graph is an undirected path or an undirected cycle. We ﬁrst focus on showing how to
adapt these results to undirected paths. Given a β-normalized LCL P deﬁned on directed paths,
we can deﬁne an LCL P′ in which the set of input labels is Σ′
in = {0, 1} × {0, 1, 2}, and the set of
output labels is Σ′
out = {0, 1, 2} × {1, . . . , β, E}. Let Vin −out and Vout −out be the veriﬁers of the
β-normalized LCL P, and let V′
in −out and V′
out −out be the veriﬁers of the LCL P′. The idea is that
we can use 3 symbols to give an orientation as input to the nodes, by giving 0 to the ﬁrst node, 1 to
the second, 2 to the third, 0 to the fourth, and so on. Nodes must copy their orientation number to
the output, and then, if the given orientation is consistent, nodes are required to solve the original
problem P. On the other hand, if the orientation is not consistent, nodes are allowed to output an
error E. Also, in order to avoid the need of error pointers, we allow nodes to treat the places where
the orientation is not consistent, as a place where the path ends.
This new LCL can be checked as follows. The V′
in −out veriﬁer takes in input the input and
the output of the current node (as before) and ﬁrst checks that the orientation has been copied
correctly, and then checks that the original Vin −out veriﬁer accepts. To verify the output, we allow
the V′
out −out veriﬁer to see slightly more than the original veriﬁer Vout −out. The V′
out −out veriﬁer
sees a triple containing the output of the node and the outputs of its neighbors. Note that the
veriﬁer does not know the orientation of the path (and the orientation of the triple), but it can
recover it from the output of the nodes (that contains a copy of the orientation given as input).
Then the V′
out −out veriﬁer checks that, if the node outputted E, the orientation is indeed wrong. If
the output is a value in 1, . . . , β, the veriﬁer V′
out −out runs the original Vout −out veriﬁer, since it
can compute which neighbor is the predecessor. It is easy to see that the complexity of P′ is the
same as the one of P.
The LCL description of P′, that is, the size of its input, its output, and its veriﬁer, is now O(β3),
therefore the hardness result still applies.
We now show how an LCL for paths can be converted to an LCL for cycles. The idea is the
following. On a cycle, we give an additional input to each node in {0, 1}. Nodes marked as 1 are
exempt to solve the problem and act as separators between the other nodes. That is, nodes are
required to solve the original problem on the subpaths that lie between nodes marked as 1. It may
be the case that no node has 1 as input. In this case we allow nodes to output a special error. If a
node decides to output this error, both its neighbors must output the same, that is, all nodes must
output the same. We impose the constraint that a node marked as 1 can not output this error. A
worst case instance would be the one in which one node is marked 1 and all other nodes are marked
0—this would represent a path with a length that is roughly equal to the one of the cycle. There
is one case that requires a bit of care: if all nodes are marked 0, but the original problem can be
solved in sublinear time, nodes could not be able to coordinate to produce the special error. For our
purpose, it is possible to check that, if we consider the problem ΠMB previously deﬁned in the case
in which MB terminates, in an instance in which nobody has a predecessor, nodes can eﬃciently
solve the problem by just outputting Error or Empty, depending on their input.
3.8
Encoding Input Labels as Trees
In this section we demonstrate a reduction from the LCL problem P with input labels on any graph
G to an LCL problem P⋆without input labels on the modiﬁed graph G⋆. The modiﬁed graph G⋆
is the result of attaching a rooted tree to each v ∈V (G) that encodes the input label of v for the
LCL problem P. The reduction allows us to extend the hardness proof to the case of LCL problems
15

--- Page 17 ---
without input labels.
Encoding.
Given a 2k-bit binary string S = (s1, . . . , s2k), deﬁne Enc(S) as the rooted tree
constructed as follows.
• Begin with the full binary tree which has 2k leaves, and the distance from the root to each
leaf is k.
• For each non-leaf node v, let u be any one of its two children, and subdivide the edge {v, u}
into two edges {v, w} and {w, u}, where w is a new node. The node w is designated as the
left child of v.
• Let U = (u1 . . . , u2k) be the leaves ordered by the in-order traversal.
• For each i ∈[2k], add two new nodes x and y as the children of ui. If si = 1, add two more
new nodes x′ and y′ and the two edges {x, x′} and {y, y′}.
The tree Enc(S) has maximum degree 3, and all nodes are within distance 2(k + 1) to the root.
Given a graph G such that each node v ∈V (G) is associated with an input label L(v) ∈Σin, deﬁne
G⋆as the graph resulting from the following operations on G. For each node v ∈V (G), attach the
rooted tree T = Enc(L(v)) to v by adding the edge {v, z}, where z is the root of T. Notice that
∆(G⋆) = max{3, ∆(G) + 1}.
Decoding.
Given a rooted tree T = Enc(S) for some S ∈{0, 1}2k, deﬁne Dec(T) = S. The
decoding can be done by the following procedure. Consider an in-order traversal of the tree such
that (i) for each node v such that exactly one of its children w has degree 2, treat w as the left child
of v, (ii) print ‘1’ if a node that has two children of degree 2 is encountered, (iii) print ‘0’ if a node
that has two children of degree 1 is encountered. Then the printed sequence is S.
The Modiﬁed LCL Problem P⋆.
Let P be an LCL problem with input labels. Suppose that
the radius of P is r, and the maximum degree is ∆. Set k = ⌈log log |Σin|⌉, and let each label in Σin
be represented by a distinct 2k-bit string. The modiﬁed LCL problem P⋆, which does not require
input label, is deﬁned by the following rules. The set of the output labels of P⋆is Σout, the same as
that of P. Let G⋆be a graph with maximum degree ≤∆+ 1.
• Deﬁne G1 = G⋆.
For each 2 ≤i ≤k + 2, deﬁne Gi as the graph induced by nodes in V (G⋆) −Si−1
j=1(Aj ∪Bj).
For each i ∈[k + 2], deﬁne Ai = {v ∈V (Gi)| degGi(v) = 1}.
For each i ∈[k + 1], deﬁne Bi = {v ∈V (Gi)| degGi(v) = 2 and ∃u ∈Ai s.t. {u, v} ∈E(Gi)}.
• Deﬁne Vlabel = Sk+2
j=1 Aj ∪Sk+1
j=1 Bj.
Deﬁne Vmain as the set of nodes in V (G⋆) \ Vlabel that have exactly one neighbor in Vlabel.
• For each v ∈Vmain, deﬁne L(v) as follows. Let u be the unique node in Vlabel adjacent to
v, and let T be the connected component induced by nodes in Vlabel that contains u. Set
L(v) = Dec(T) (with u being the root of T). If the decoding procedure Dec(T) fails, simply
set L(v) as the ﬁrst label in Σin.
• The output labeling, together with the input labeling deﬁned by the function L(·), forms a
legal labeling of the subgraph induced by the nodes in Vmain for P.
16

--- Page 18 ---
Notice that the connected components in Vlabel are the trees encoding input labels, and the subgraph
induced by the nodes in Vmain is G (as long as G does not contain isolated node). The function L(v)
recovers the input label of v for each v ∈V (G). Given that P has a valid labeling on all graphs
(resp., trees) of maximum degree ∆, the modiﬁed LCL problem P⋆also has a valid labeling on all
graphs (resp., trees) of maximum degree ∆+ 1.
Reducing the Radius.
The above deﬁnition of P⋆requires radius r + O(k), as a node v ∈Vmain
needs O(k) extra rounds to calculate L(u) for all u ∈Nr(v)∪Vmain. We present a simple modiﬁcation
that reduces the radius to only r + O(1) at the cost of expanding the number of output labels from
|Σout| to |Σout| + 22k < |Σout| + |Σin|2. The idea is to let nodes in Vlabel to use output labels to
pass the information stored at the leaves to the root based on local rules. Consider a connected
component T induced by nodes in Vlabel. The subgraph T is interpreted as a tree rooted at the
unique node in T that is adjacent to some node in Vmain.
Base Case: Let v ∈A2. If v is adjacent to two nodes in B1, the output label of v is 1; otherwise
the output label of v is 0.
Root / Degree-3 Nodes: Let 3 ≤i ≤k + 2, and let v ∈Ai. Then v has a unique neighbor
uleft ∈Bi+1 and a unique neighbor uright ∈Ai+1. Let Sleft be the output label of uleft, and let
Sright be the output label of uright. Then the output label of v is the binary string Sleft ◦Sright.
Degree-2 Nodes: Let 3 ≤i ≤k + 1, and let v ∈Bi. Then v has a unique neighbor u ∈Ai+1. The
output label of v is the same as the output label of u.
Thus, for each node v ∈Vmain, L(v) is simply the output label of the unique node u ∈Vlabel ∩N(v).
Theorem 6. For any LCL problem P on any graph G of maximum degree ∆that does not have
isolated nodes, the following two statements are equivalent.
• The labeling L: V (G) →Σout is a valid labeling of G for the problem P.
• There exists some labeling L′ of the nodes in Vlabel such that L and L′ together form a valid
labeling of G⋆for the problem P⋆.
Theorem 7. It is PSPACE-hard to distinguish whether a given LCL problem P without input labels
can be solved in O(1) time or needs Ω(n) time on trees with degree ∆= 3.

Decidability
In this section, we show that the two gaps ω(1)—o(log∗n) and ω(log∗n)—o(n) for LCL problems
with input labels on paths and cycles are decidable. More speciﬁcally, given a speciﬁcation of an
LCL problem P, there is an algorithm that outputs a description of an asymptotically optimal
deterministic LOCAL algorithm for P, as well as its time complexity.
We will prove the statements for the case of cycles, but the analogous results for cycles and paths
follows as a simple corollary, as we can encode constraints related to degree-1 nodes as constraints
related to nodes adjacent to a special input label. Furthermore, having a promise that the input is
a path does not change the time complexity of an LCL problem: if a problem can be solved in time
T = o(n) in labeled paths, the same algorithm will solve it also in time T = o(n) in labeled cycles.
The proof of Theorem 8 is in Section 4.2; the proof of Theorem 9 is in Section 4.5.
17

--- Page 19 ---
Theorem 8. For any LCL problem P on cycle graphs, its deterministic LOCAL complexity is either
Ω(n) or O(log∗n). Moreover, there is an algorithm that decides whether P has complexity Ω(n)
or O(log∗n) on cycle graphs; for the case the complexity is O(log∗n), the algorithm outputs a
description of an O(log∗n)-round deterministic LOCAL algorithm that solves P.
Theorem 9. For any LCL problem P on cycle graphs, its deterministic LOCAL complexity is either
Ω(log∗n) or O(1). Moreover, there is an algorithm that decides whether P has complexity Ω(log∗n)
or O(1) on cycle graphs; for the case the complexity is O(1), the algorithm outputs a description of
an O(1)-round deterministic LOCAL algorithm that solves P.
Graph Notation.
For convenience, in this section, a directed path P with input labels is
alternatively described as a string in Σk
in, where k > 0 is the number of nodes in P. Similarly,
an output labeling L of P is alternatively described as a string in Σk
out. In subsequent discussion,
we freely switch between the graph-theoretic notation and the string notation. Given an output
labeling L of P, we say that L is locally consistent at v if the input and output labeling assigned to
Nr(v) is acceptable for v. Note that Nr(v) refers to the radius-r neighborhood of v. Given two
integers a ≤b, the notation [a, b] represents the set of all integers {a, a + 1, . . . , b}. Given a string
w, denote wR as the reverse of w.
Overview.
Before we proceed, we brieﬂy discuss the high level idea of the proofs. The main tool
underlying the proofs is the “pumping lemma” which was developed in [6]. Intuitively, we classify
the set of all input-labeled paths into a ﬁnite number of equivalence classes satisfying the following
property. Let P be a subpath of G, and let P ′ be another path that is of the same equivalence
class as P. Given a complete legal labeling of G, if we let G′ be the result of replacing P with
P ′, then it is always possible to extend this partial labeling of G′ to a complete legal labeling by
appropriately labeling P ′. The pumping lemma guarantees that for any path P whose length is
at least the pumping constant ℓpump, and for any number x ≥ℓpump, there is another path P ′ of
length at least x and P ′ is of the same equivalence class as P.
Informally, in the proof of Theorem 8, we show that any LCL problem P solvable in o(n) rounds
can be solved in O(log∗n) rounds in the following canonical way based on a “feasible labeling
function” f. Intuitively, a labeling function f is feasible if for any given independent set I that is
suﬃciently well-spaced, we can apply f to assign the output labels to each v ∈I and its nearby
neighbors locally such that this partial labeling can always be extended to a complete legal labeling.
The ω(log∗n)—o(n) gap and the decidability result follows from these two claims.
• If there is an o(n)-round algorithm A that solves P, then a feasible function f exists. This
is proved by ﬁrst create an imaginary graph where some paths are extended using pumping
lemmas, and then apply a simulation of A on the imaginary graph.
• Whether a feasible function exists is decidable. Intuitively, this is due to the fact that the
number of equivalence classes is ﬁnite.
The proof of Theorem 9 is a little more complicated since the time budget is only O(1), so
we cannot even aﬀord to ﬁnd an MIS. To solve this issue, we decompose the cycle graph G into
paths with unrepetitive patterns and paths with repetitive patterns, in O(1) rounds. For paths
with unrepetitive patterns, we are able to compute a suﬃciently well-spaced MIS in O(1) rounds
by making use of the irregularity of the input patterns. Paths with repetitive patterns are similar
to the paths without input labels, and we will show that we can always label them by repetitive
output patterns, given that the underlying LCL problem is o(log∗n)-time solvable.

4.1
Pumping Lemmas for Paths
Let P = (s, . . . , t) be a directed path, where each node has an input label from Σin. The tripartition
of the nodes ξ(P) = (D1, D2, D3) is deﬁned as follows:
D1 = Nr−1(s) ∪Nr−1(t),
D2 =
 N2r−1(s) ∪N2r−1(t)

\ D1,
D3 = P \ (D1 ∪D2).
See Figure 4 for an illustration. More speciﬁcally, suppose P = (u1, . . . , uk), and let i ∈[1, k]. Then
we have:
• ui ∈D1 if and only if i ∈[1, r] ∪[k −r + 1, k].
• ui ∈D2 if and only if i ∈[r + 1, 2r] ∪[k −2r + 1, k −r].
• ui ∈D3 if and only if i /∈[1, 2r] ∪[k −2r + 1, k].
Let L: D1 ∪D2 →Σout assign output labels to D1 ∪D2. We say that L is extendible w.r.t. P if
there exists a complete labeling L⋄of P such that L⋄agrees with L on D1 ∪D2, and L⋄is locally
consistent at all nodes in D2 ∪D3.
An Equivalence Class.
We deﬁne an equivalence class ⋆∼for the directed paths (i.e., the set of
all non-empty strings in Σ∗
in), as follows.
Consider two directed paths P = (u1, . . . , ux) and P ′ = (v1, . . . , vy), and let ξ(P) = (D1, D2, D3)
and ξ(P ′) = (D′
1, D′
2, D′
3). Consider the following natural 1-to-1 correspondence φ: (D1 ∪D2) →
(D′
1 ∪D′
2) deﬁned as φ(ui) = vi and φ(ux−i+1) = vy−i+1 for each i ∈[1, 2r].
The 1-to-1
correspondence is well-deﬁned so long as (i) x = y or (ii) x ≥4r and y ≥4r. We have P
⋆∼P ′ if
and only if the following two statements are met:
• Isomorphism: The 1-to-1 correspondence φ is well-deﬁned, and for each ui ∈D1 ∪D2,
the input label of ui is identical to the input label of φ(ui).
• Extendibility: Let L be any assignment of output labels to nodes in D1 ∪D2, and let
L′ be the corresponding output labeling of D′
1 ∪D′
2 under φ. Then L is extendible w.r.t.
P if and only if L′ is extendible w.r.t. P ′.
Note that for the special case of x ≤4r, we have P
⋆∼P ′ if and only if P is identical to P ′.
Deﬁne Type(P) as the equivalence class of P w.r.t. ⋆∼. The following technical lemma is analogous
to [6, Lemma 1] in a specialized setting. We only use this lemma to prove the lemmas in Section 4.1.
19

--- Page 21 ---
Lemma 10. Let G be a path graph or a cycle graph where all nodes have input labels from Σin. Let
P be a directed subpath of G, and let P ′ be another directed path such that Type(P ′) = Type(P).
We write ξ(P) = (D1, D2, D3) and ξ(P ′) = (D′
1, D′
2, D′
3). Let L⋄be any complete labeling of G
such that L⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in D2 ∪D3. Let G′ = Replace(G, P, P ′) be the graph
resulting from replacing P with P ′ in G. Then there exists a complete labeling L′
⋄of G′ such that
the following two conditions are met.
1. For each v ∈(V (G) \ V (P))∪(D1∪D2) and its corresponding v′ ∈(V (G′) \ V (P ′))∪(D′
1∪D′
2),
we have L⋄(v) = L′
⋄(v′). Moreover, if v ∈(V (G) \ V (P)) ∪D1 and L⋄is locally consistent at
v, then L′
⋄is locally consistent at v′.
2. L′
⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in D′
2 ∪D′
3.
Proof. The labeling L′
⋄(v′) of G′ for each v′ ∈(V (G′) \ V (P ′)) ∪(D′
1 ∪D′
2) is chosen “naturally”
as follows.
For each v′ ∈V (G′) \ V (P ′), we set L′
⋄(v′) = L⋄(v) for its corresponding node
v ∈V (G)\V (P). For each v′ ∈D′
1∪D′
2, we set L′
⋄(v′) = L⋄(v) for its corresponding node v ∈D1∪D2
such that φ(v) = v′ in the deﬁnition of ⋆∼. At this point, it is clear that if v ∈(V (G) \ V (P)) ∪D1
has a locally consistent labeling under L⋄, then its corresponding node v′ ∈(V (G′) \ V (P ′)) ∪D′
1
also has a locally consistent labeling under L′
⋄, so Condition 1 holds.
Now, the labeling L′
⋄is only undeﬁned for nodes in D′
3. We show that we can complete the
labeling in such a way that is locally consistent at all nodes in D′
2 ∪D′
3. Denote L as L⋄restricted
to D1 ∪D2. Since L⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in P, the labeling L is extendible w.r.t. P.
Note that if we let L′ be L⋄restricted to D′
1 ∪D′
2, then according to the way we deﬁne L′
⋄, the two
labeling L′ and L are identical under the 1-to-1 correspondence φ speciﬁed in the deﬁnition of ⋆∼.
That is, for each v′ ∈D′
1 ∪D′
2, we have L′(v′) = L(v) for its corresponding node v ∈D1 ∪D2 such
that φ(v) = v′. Since P
⋆∼P ′, the labeling L′ must be extendible w.r.t. P ′. That is, there is a way
to assign L′
⋄(v′) for each v′ ∈D′
3 such that all nodes in D′
2 ∪D′
3 have locally consistent labelings
under L′
⋄, so Condition 2 holds.
One useful consequence of this lemma is that if we start with a path or a cycle G with a legal
labeling, after replacing its subpath P with another one P ′ having the same type as P, then it
is always possible to assign output labeling to P ′ to get a legal labeling without changing the
already-assigned output labels of nodes outside of P ′.
Lemma 11. Let G be a path graph or a cycle graph where all nodes have input labels from Σin. Let
P be a directed subpath of G, and let P ′ be another directed path such that Type(P ′) = Type(P). Let
L⋄be complete labeling of G that is locally consistent at all nodes in P. Let G′ = Replace(G, P, P ′)
be the graph resulting from replacing P with P ′ in G. Then there exists a legal labeling L′
⋄of G′
such that the following two conditions are met.
1. For each v ∈V (G) \ V (P) and its corresponding v′ ∈V (G′) \ V (P ′), we have L⋄(v) = L′
⋄(v′).
Moreover, if L⋄is locally consistent at v ∈V (G) \ V (P), then L′
⋄is locally consistent at v′.
2. L′
⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in P ′.
Proof. We write ξ(P ′) = (D′
1, D′
2, D′
3). Condition 1 in this lemma is implied by Condition 1 in
Lemma 10. To see that Condition 2 in this lemma holds, note that in this lemma we additionally
require that L⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in P. Therefore, Condition 1 of Lemma 10 implies
that L′
⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in D′
1. This observation, together with Condition 2 of
Lemma 10, implies that L′
⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in P ′.

The following lemma is analogous to [6, Theorem 4] in a specialized setting. We only use this
lemma in Section 4.1.
Lemma 12. Let P = (v1, . . . , vk), and let P ′ = (v1, . . . , vk−1). Let the input label of vk be α. Then
Type(P) is a function of α and Type(P ′).
Proof. We prove the following stronger statement. Let G be a directed path, and let H be a
directed subpath of G.
Suppose H′ is another directed path satisfying Type(H) = Type(H′).
Let G′ = Replace(G, H, H′) be the result of replacing H with H′ in G.
Then we claim that
Type(G) = Type(G′). The lemma is a corollary of this claim.
Consider the tripartitions ξ(H) = (B1, B2, B3), ξ(H′) = (B′
1, B′
2, B′
3), ξ(G) = (D1, D2, D3), and
ξ(G′) = (D′
1, D′
2, D′
3). We write B0 = V (G) \ V (H) and B′
0 = V (G′) \ V (H′).
Let φ⋆be the natural 1-to-1 correspondence from B0 ∪B1 ∪B2 to B′
0 ∪B′
1 ∪B′
2. Note that
D1 ∪D2 ⊆B0 ∪B1 ∪B2 and D′
1 ∪D′
2 ⊆B′
0 ∪B′
1 ∪B′
2. Also, the 1-to-1 correspondence between
D1 ∪D2 and D′
1 ∪D′
2 given by φ⋆is exactly the 1-to-1 correspondence φ speciﬁed in the requirement
of G ⋆∼G′.
Let L: (D1 ∪D2) →Σout and let L′ be the corresponding output labeling of D′
1 ∪D′
2, under
the 1-to-1 correspondence φ. To show that G ⋆∼G′, all we need to do is show that L is extendible
w.r.t. G if and only if L′ is extendible w.r.t. G′. Since we can also write G = Replace(G′, H′, H), it
suﬃces to show just one direction, i.e., if L is extendible then L′ is extendible.
Suppose L is extendible. Then there exists an output labeling L⋄of G such that (i) for each
v ∈D1 ∪D2, we have L⋄(v) = L(v), and (ii) L⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in D2 ∪D3. Since
D2 ∪D3 ⊇B2 ∪B3, we can apply Lemma 10, which shows that there exists a complete labeling
L′
⋄of G′ such that the two conditions in Lemma 10 are met. We argue that this implies that L′ is
extendible. We verify that (i) L′(v′) = L′
⋄(v′) for each v′ ∈D′
1 ∪D′
2, and (ii) L′
⋄is locally consistent
at all nodes in D′
2 ∪D′
3.
• Condition 1 of Lemma 10 guarantees that L⋄(v) = L′
⋄(φ⋆(v)) for each v ∈(V (G) \ V (H)) ∪
(B1 ∪B2) = B0 ∪B1 ∪B2 and its corresponding node φ⋆(v) ∈B′
0 ∪B′
1 ∪B′
2. Since D′
1 ∪D′
2 ⊆
B′
0 ∪B′
1 ∪B′
2, we have L′(v′) = L′
⋄(v′) for each v′ ∈D′
1 ∪D′
2.
• The fact that L⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in D2 ∪D3, together with Condition 1 in
Lemma 10, guarantees that L′
⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in (D′
2 ∪D′
3) \ B′
3. Condition 2
in Lemma 10 guarantees that L′
⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in B′
2 ∪B′
3. Therefore, L′
⋄is
locally consistent at all nodes in D′
2 ∪D′
3, as required.
The number of types can be upper bounded as follows.
Lemma 13. The number of equivalence classes of ⋆∼(i.e., types) is at most |Σin|4r2|Σout|4r.
Proof. Let P be a directed path, and let ξ(P) = (D1, D2, D3). Then Type(P) is determined by the
following information.
• The input labels in D1 ∪D2. Note that there are at most |Σin|4r possible input labeling of
D1 ∪D2.
• A length-x binary string indicating the extendibility of each possible output labeling of D1∪D2,
where x = |Σout|4r.
Therefore, the number of equivalence classes of ⋆∼is at most |Σin|4r2|Σout|4r.

Deﬁne ℓpump as the total number of types. Observe that Lemma 12 implies that Type(P) can be
computed by a ﬁnite automaton whose number of states is the total number of types, which is a
constant independent of P. Thus, we have the following two pumping lemmas which allow us to
extend the length of a given directed path P while preserving the type of P. The following two
lemmas follow from the standard pumping lemma for regular language.
Lemma 14. Let P ∈Σk
in with k ≥ℓpump.
Then P can be decomposed into three substrings
P = x ◦y ◦z such that (i) |xy| ≤ℓpump, (ii) |y| ≥1, and (iii) for each non-negative integer i,
Type(x ◦yi ◦z) = Type(P).
Lemma 15. For each w ∈Σ>0
in , there exist two positive integers a and b such that a + b ≤ℓpump,
and Type(wai+b) is invariant for each non-negative integer i.
4.2
The ω(log∗n)—o(n) Gap
In this section we show that the ω(log∗n)—o(n) gap is decidable. More speciﬁcally, we show that
an LCL problem P can be solved in O(log∗n) rounds if and only if there exists a feasible function,
which is deﬁned as follows.
Input: A directed path P = w1 ◦S ◦w2, where |w1| ∈[ℓpump, ℓpump + 1], |w2| ∈[ℓpump, ℓpump + 1],
and |S| = 2r. The decomposition P = w1 ◦S ◦w2 is considered part of the input.
Output: A string L ∈Σ2r
out that represents the output labeling of S.
Requirement: Any such function f is said to be feasible if the following requirement is met for
any paths S1, S2 and wa, wb, wc, wd such that |S1| = |S2| = 2r and {|wa|, |wb|, |wc|, |wd|} ⊆
[ℓpump, ℓpump + 1]. Let P = wa ◦S1 ◦wb ◦wc ◦S2 ◦wd, and consider the following assignment
of output labels to S1 ∪S2.
• Either label S1 by f(wa ◦S1 ◦wb) or label SR
1 by f(wR
b ◦SR
1 ◦wR
a ).
• Either label S2 by f(wc ◦S2 ◦wd) or label SR
2 by f(wR
d ◦SR
2 ◦wR
c ).
It is required that given such a partial labeling of P, the middle part wb ◦wc can be assigned
output labels in such a way that the labeling of (i) the last r nodes of S1, (ii) all nodes in
wb ◦wc, and (iii) the ﬁrst r nodes of S2 are locally consistent.
The following lemma is a straightforward consequence of the well-known O(log∗n)-round MIS
algorithm on cycles.
Lemma 16. Let G be a cycle graph of n nodes, and let s ≤k be two constant integers such that
s + k ≤n. Then in O(log∗n) rounds we can compute a decomposition V = A ∪B such that each
connected component of A has size s, and each connected component of B has size within [k, k + 1].
Proof. For any given constant integer 1 ≤L < n, we will show that in O(log∗n) time we can ﬁnd
an independent set I of G such that each connected component induced by V \ I has at least L
nodes and at most 2L nodes. Using this result with L = 2(s −1) + k(s + k + 1), it is straightforward
to obtain the desired decomposition V = A ∪B, as follows.
For each v ∈I, it arbitrarily chooses a size-s path Sv that contains v, and all nodes in Sv are
included to A. Now each connected component S′ induced by the remaining nodes is a path of
size at least L −2(s −1) ≥k(s + k + 1) and at most 2L. We will divide the path S′ into subpaths
R1, R2, . . . , Rt meeting the following conditions: (i) if i is odd, then the size of Ri is k or k + 1;
22

--- Page 24 ---
(ii) if i is even, then the size of Ri is s; (iii) t is odd. Hence we obtain the desired decomposition
V = A ∪B if we include the nodes in R1, R3, . . . to B and include the nodes in R2, R4, . . . to A. We
show that such a decomposition of S′ into subpaths R1, R2, . . . , Rt exists. Denote z as the size of
S′. We write z = α(s + k + 1) + β, where α > 0 and 0 ≤β < s + k + 1 are integers. Note that we
must have α ≥k and β ≤2k.
• For the case β ≥k, there is a decomposition R1, R2, . . . , Rt satisﬁes the following conditions:
(i) if i is odd, then the size of Ri is k + 1 when i < t or β when i = t; (ii) if i is even, then the
size of Ri is s; (iii) t = 2α + 1 is odd.
• For the case β < k, there is a decomposition R1, R2, . . . , Rt satisﬁes the following conditions:
(i) if i is odd, then the size of Ri is k when i ∈{1, 3, 5, . . . , 2(k−β)−1}∪{t} or k+1 otherwise;
(ii) if i is even, then the size of Ri is s; (iii) t = 2α + 1 is odd.
For the rest of the proof, we show that in O(log∗n) time we can ﬁnd the required independent
set I. We prove the lemma by an induction on L. The base case of L = 1 is identical to the MIS
problem. Now consider L > 1. By induction hypothesis, we ﬁnd an independent set I′ in O(log∗n)
time such that each connected component induced by V \ I′ has at least L′ nodes and at most 2L′
nodes, where L′ = ⌊L/2⌋. Let G′ be the graph resulting from contracting all nodes in V \ I′, and
we compute an MIS I′′ on this graph G′, which can be done in O(log∗n) rounds in the original
graph G. Note that each connected component S of V \ I′′ has size at least 2L′ + 1 ≥L and at most
3(2L′) + 2. If the size of S is higher than 2L, then we can add some nodes in S to the independent
set I′′ so that the component size of the remaining nodes in S is within [L, 2L].
Lemma 17. If a feasible function f exists, then there is an O(log∗n)-round deterministic LOCAL
algorithm for P on cycles.
Proof. Given that the number of nodes n is at least some large enough constant, in O(log∗n) rounds
we can compute a decomposition V = A ∪B such that each connected component of A has size 2r,
and each connected component of B has size within [2ℓpump, 2ℓpump + 1]. This can be done using
Lemma 16 with s = 2r and k = 2ℓpump. We further decompose each connected component P of
B into two paths P = P1 ◦P2 in such a way that the size of both P1 and P2 are within the range
[ℓpump, ℓpump + 1]. We write P to denote the set of all these paths.
Let S be a connected component of A, and let w1 and w2 be its two neighboring paths in P so
that (w1 ◦S ◦w2) is a subpath of the underlying graph G. The output labels of S are assigned either
by labeling S with f(w1 ◦S ◦w2) or by labeling SR with f(wR
2 ◦SR ◦wR
1 ). At this moment, all
components of A have been assigned output labels using f. By the feasibility of f, each connected
component of B is able to label itself output labels in such a way that the labeling of all nodes are
locally consistent.
Lemma 18. If there is an o(n)-round deterministic LOCAL algorithm A for P on cycles, then a
feasible function f exists.
Proof. Fix s to be some suﬃciently large number, and ﬁx n = 8(s + ℓpump) + 2(2r). We select s to
be large enough so that the runtime of A is smaller than 0.1s. For any given directed path w with
|w| ∈[ℓpump, ℓpump + 1], we ﬁx w+ as the result of applying the pumping lemma (Lemma 14) on w
so that the following two conditions are met: (i) |w+| ∈[s, s + ℓpump] and (ii) Type(w) = Type(w+).
23

--- Page 25 ---
Constructing a Feasible Function f by Simulating A.
The function f(w1 ◦S ◦w2) is
constructed by simulating a given o(n)-round deterministic LOCAL algorithm for P. The output
labeling given by f(w1 ◦S ◦w2) is exactly the result of simulating A on the path P = w+
1 ◦S ◦w+
2
while assuming the number of nodes of the underlying graph is n. Remember that the round
complexity of A is o(n) on n-node graphs. By setting s to be large enough, the runtime of A can be
made smaller than 0.1s. Thus, the calculation of f(w1 ◦S ◦w2) only depends on the IDs and the
input labels of (i) the last 0.1s nodes in w+
1 , (ii) all nodes in S, and (iii) the ﬁrst 0.1s nodes in w+
2 .
In the calculation of f(w1 ◦S ◦w2), the IDs of the nodes that participate in the simulation of A are
chosen arbitrarily so long as they are distinct.
Feasibility of f.
Now we verify that the function f constructed above is feasible. Consider any
choices of paths S1, S2 and wa, wb, wc, wd such that |S1| = |S2| = 2r and {|wa|, |wb|, |wc|, |wd|} ⊆
[ℓpump, ℓpump + 1]. Deﬁne P = wa ◦S1 ◦wb ◦wc ◦S2 ◦wd, and let G be the cycle graph formed by
connecting the two ends of the path P. To show that f is feasible, we need to consider the following
four ways of assigning output labels to S1 ∪S2.
1. Label S1 by f(wa ◦S1 ◦wb); label S2 by f(wc ◦S2 ◦wd).
2. Label S1 by f(wa ◦S1 ◦wb); label SR
2 by f(wR
d ◦SR
2 ◦wR
c ).
3. Label SR
1 by f(wR
b ◦SR
1 ◦wR
a ); label S2 by f(wc ◦S2 ◦wd).
4. Label SR
1 by f(wR
b ◦SR
1 ◦wR
a ); label SR
2 by f(wR
d ◦SR
2 ◦wR
c ).
For each of the above four partial labelings of P, we need to show that the middle part wb ◦wc
can still be assigned output labels in such a way that the labeling of (i) the last r nodes of S1, (ii)
all nodes in wb ◦wc, and (iii) the ﬁrst r nodes of S2 are locally consistent.
Proof of the First Case.
In what follows, we focus on the ﬁrst case, i.e., the partial labeling is
given by labeling S1 by f(wa ◦S1 ◦wb) and labeling S2 by f(wc ◦S2 ◦wd); the proof for the other
three cases are analogous. In this case, we deﬁne P ′ = w+
a ◦S1 ◦w+
b ◦w+
c ◦S2 ◦w+
d , and let G′ be
the cycle graph formed by connecting the two ends of P ′. Note that the number of nodes in G′ is at
most 8(s + ℓpump) + 2(2r) = n. All we need to do is to ﬁnd an output labeling L of G such that the
following conditions are satisﬁed.
(a) The output labels of S1 is given by f(wa ◦S1 ◦wb).
(b) The output labels of S2 is given by f(wc ◦S2 ◦wd).
(c) The labeling of (i) the last r nodes of S1, (ii) all nodes in wb ◦wc, and (iii) the ﬁrst r nodes of
S2 are locally consistent.
We ﬁrst generate an output labeling L′ of G′ by executing A on G′ under the following ID
assignment. The IDs of (i) the last 0.1s nodes in w+
a , (ii) all nodes in S1, and (iii) the ﬁrst 0.1s
nodes in w+
b are chosen as the ones used in the deﬁnition of f(wa ◦S1 ◦wb). Similarly, the IDs of (i)
the last 0.1s nodes in w+
c , (ii) all nodes in S2, and (iii) the ﬁrst 0.1s nodes in w+
d are chosen as the
ones used in the deﬁnition of f(wc ◦S2 ◦wd). The IDs of the rest of the nodes are chosen arbitrarily
so long as when we run A on G′, no node sees two nodes with the same ID. Due to the way we
deﬁne f, the output labeling L′ of the subpath S1 is exactly given by f(wa ◦S1 ◦wb), and the output
labeling L′ of S2 is exactly f(wc ◦S2 ◦wd). Due to the correctness of A, L′ is a legal labeling.
We transform the output labeling L′ of G′ to a desired output labeling L of G. Remember that
G is the result of replacing the four subpaths w+ of G′ by w, and we have Type(w+) = Type(w). In
view of Lemma 11, there is a legal labeling L of G such that all nodes in S1 and S2 are labeled the
same as in G′. Therefore, the labeling L satisﬁes the above three conditions (a), (b), and (c).
24

--- Page 26 ---
The Other Cases.
We brieﬂy discuss how we modify the proof to deal with the other three
cases. For example, consider the second case, where the partial labeling is given by labeling S1 by
f(wa ◦S1 ◦wb) and labeling SR
2 by f(wR
d ◦SR
2 ◦wR
c ). In this case, the path P ′ is deﬁned as
P ′ = w+
a ◦S1 ◦w+
b ◦
 (wR
c )+R ◦SR
2 ◦
 (wR
d )+R .
During the ID assignment of G′, the IDs of (i) the last 0.1s nodes in w+
c , (ii) all nodes in S2, and
(iii) the ﬁrst 0.1s nodes in w+
d are now chosen as the ones used in the deﬁnition of f(wR
d ◦SR
2 ◦wR
c ).
Using such an ID assignment, the output labeling L′ of SR
2 as the result of executing A on G′ will
be exactly the same as the output labeling given by f(wR
d ◦SR
2 ◦wR
c ). The rest of the proof is the
same.
Theorem 8 follows from the above two lemmas. The decidability result is due to the simple
observation that whether a feasible function exists is decidable.
4.3
Partitioning a Cycle
In the following sections, we prove the decidability result associated with the ω(1)—o(log∗n) gap.
In this proof, we also deﬁne a feasible function, prove its decidability, and show the existence given
an o(log∗n)-time algorithm. The main challenge here is that an MIS cannot be computed in O(1)
time. To solve this issue, we decompose a cycle into paths with unrepetitive patterns and paths
with repetitive patterns. For paths with unrepetitive patterns, we are able to compute a suﬃciently
well-spaced MIS in O(1) time by making use of the irregularity of the input patterns.
Section 4.3 considers an O(1)-round algorithm that partitions a cycle into some short paths
and some paths that have a repeated input pattern. Section 4.4 deﬁnes a feasible function whose
existence characterizes the O(1)-round solvable LCL problems. In Section 4.5, we prove Theorem 9.
Partitioning an Undirected Cycle into Directed Paths.
Let G be a cycle graph.
An
orientation of a node v is an assignment to one of its neighbor, this can be speciﬁed using port-
numbering. An orientation of the nodes in G is called ℓ-orientation if the following condition is met.
If |V (G)| ≤ℓ, then all nodes in G are oriented to the same direction. If |V (G)| > ℓ, then each node
v ∈V (G) belongs to a path P such that (i) all nodes in P are oriented to the same direction, and
(ii) the number of nodes in P is at least ℓ. In O(1) rounds we can compute an ℓ-orientation of G for
any constant ℓ.
Lemma 19 ([6]). Let G be a cycle graph. Let ℓbe a constant. There is a deterministic LOCAL
algorithm that computes an ℓ-orientation of G in O(1) rounds.
In this section, we will use a generalization of an ℓ-orientation that satisﬁes an additional
requirement that the input labels of each directed path P in the decomposition with |V (P)| > 2ℓwidth
(where 2ℓwidth is a threshold) must form a periodic string (whose period length is at most ℓpattern).
A string w ∈Σ∗
in is called primitive if w cannot be written as xi for some x ∈Σ∗
in and i ≥2. Let
G be a cycle graph or a path graph where each node v ∈V (G) has an input label from Σin. We
deﬁne an (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition as a partition of G into a set of connected subgraphs P
meeting the following criteria. We assume |V (G)| > 2ℓwidth and ℓpattern ≥ℓwidth.
Direction and Minimum Length: For each P ∈P, the nodes in P are oriented to the same
direction, and |V (P)| ≥ℓwidth.
25

--- Page 27 ---
Short Paths: Deﬁne Pshort as the subset of P that contains paths having at most 2ℓwidth
nodes. For each directed path P = (v1, . . . , vk) ∈Pshort, each node vi in P knows its rank i.
Long Paths: Deﬁne Plong = P \ Pshort. Then the input labeling of the nodes in P is of the
form wk for some primitive string w ∈Σ∗
in such that |w| ≤ℓpattern and k ≥ℓcount. Moreover,
each node v in P knows the string w.
Note that P may contain a cycle. This is possible only when G is a cycle where the input
labeling is a repetition (at least ℓcount times) of a primitive string w ∈Σ∗
in of length at most ℓpattern.
In this case, we must have P = Plong = {G}. Otherwise, P contains only paths.
The goal of this section is to show that an (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition can be found in O(1)
rounds. First of all, in Lemma 20 we demonstrate how we can break symmetry in O(1) rounds
given that the underlying graph is directed and the input labels does not form long periodic strings.
Let G be a path or a cycle. A set I ⊆V (G) is called an (α, β)-independent set if the following
conditions are met: (i) I is an independent set, and I does not contain either endpoint of G (if G is
a path), and (ii) each connected component induced by V \ I has at least α nodes and at most β
nodes, unless |V | ≤α, in which case we allow I = ∅. Note that ﬁnding an (α, β)-independent set
takes O(log∗n) rounds in general, but in Lemma 20 we show that by leveraging the “irregularity”
of input labels, we can do this in O(1) rounds on directed paths or cycles without periodic patterns.
Lemma 20. Let γ and ℓbe any two constants with ℓ≥γ. Let G be a directed cycle or a directed
path that does not contain any subpath of the form wx, with |w| ≤γ and |wx| ≥ℓ. There is a
deterministic LOCAL algorithm that computes an (γ, 2γ)-independent set I of G in O(1) rounds.
Proof. For the case G is a directed path P = (s, . . . , t), deﬁne V ′ as the set of nodes in G whose
distance to t is at least ℓ−1. For the case G is a directed cycle, deﬁne V ′ = V (G). In what follows,
we focus on ﬁnding an (γ, 2γ)-independent set I′ of the nodes in V ′. Extending the set I′ to produce
the desired independent set I can be done with extra O(1) rounds.
Recall that G is directed. Deﬁne the color of a node v ∈V ′ by the sequence of the ℓinput labels
of v and the ℓ−1 nodes following v in G. For each node v ∈V ′, there is no other node within
distance γ to v having the same color as v, since otherwise we can ﬁnd a subpath whose input labels
form a string wx, with |w| ≤γ and |wx| ≥ℓ. By applying the standard procedure that computes an
MIS from a coloring, within O(1) rounds a (γ, 2γ)-independent set I′ can be obtained.
Using Lemma 20, we ﬁrst show that an (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition can be found in O(1)
rounds for the case G is directed. That is, all nodes in G are initially oriented to the same direction,
and we are allowed to re-orient the nodes.
Lemma 21. Let G be a directed cycle or a directed path where each node v ∈V (G) has an input label
from Σin, and |V (G)| > 2ℓwidth. Let ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern be three constants such that ℓpattern ≥ℓwidth.
There is a deterministic LOCAL algorithm that computes an (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition in O(1)
rounds
Proof. Let (w1, w2, . . . , wk) be any ordering of the primitive strings in Σ∗
in of length at most ℓpattern.
First, construct a set of subgraphs Plong as follows. Initialize U = V (G) and Plong = ∅. For i = 1 to
k, execute the following procedure. Let Si be the set of maximal-size connected subgraphs formed by
nodes in U such that the input labels form the string wx
i with x ≥ℓcount + 2ℓwidth. Each node v ∈U
in O(1) rounds checks if v belongs to a subgraph in Si; if so, remove v from U. For each P ∈Si,
26

--- Page 28 ---
deﬁne P ′ as follows. If P is a cycle, then P ′ = P. If P is a path, then P ′ is the result of removing
all nodes that are within distance ℓwidth|wi| −1 to an endpoint in P. Note that each node v in P
knows whether v belongs to P ′. Deﬁne S′
i = {P ′|P ∈Si}, and then update Plong ←Plong ∪S′
i.
It is straightforward to verify that each path or cycle P ∈Plong satisﬁes the requirement in the
deﬁnition of (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition. Deﬁne the set of subgraphs Pirreg as the connected
components of the nodes not in any subgraph in Plong. Deﬁne ℓ= (ℓpattern + 2ℓwidth) · ℓcount. By
our construction, the input labeling in each subgraph P ∈Pirreg does not contain any substring
wx, with 1 ≤|w| ≤ℓpattern and |wx| ≥ℓ. An (ℓpattern, 2ℓpattern)-independent set of each P ∈Pirreg
can be computed using Lemma 20 in O(1) rounds. Observe that each subgraph P ∈Pirreg has at
least ℓwidth nodes. Given an (ℓpattern, 2ℓpattern)-independent set of a subgraph P ∈Pirreg, in O(1)
rounds P can be partitioned into subpaths, each of which contains at least ℓpattern nodes and at
most 2ℓpattern nodes. This ﬁnishes the construction of an (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition.
Combining Lemma 21 and Lemma 19, we are able to construct an (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition
in O(1) rounds for undirected graphs.
Lemma 22. Let G be a cycle or a path where each node v ∈V (G) has an input label from Σin, and
|V (G)| > 2ℓwidth. Let ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern be three constants such that ℓpattern ≥ℓwidth. There is a
deterministic LOCAL algorithm that computes an (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition in O(1) rounds
Proof. The algorithm is as follows. Compute an ℓ-orientation of G by Lemma 19 in O(1) rounds
with ℓ= 2ℓwidth + 1. For each maximal-length connected subgraph P where each constituent node
is oriented to the same direction, ﬁnd an (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition of P in O(1) rounds by
Lemma 21.
4.4
Feasible Function
The goal of this section is to deﬁne a feasible function whose existence characterizes the O(1)-round
solvable LCL problems. With respect to an LCL problem P and a function f which takes a string
w ∈Σk
in with 1 ≤k ≤ℓpump as input, and returns a string f(w) ∈Σk
out, we deﬁne some partially or
completely labeled path graphs which are used in the deﬁnition of a feasible function.
Completely Labeled Graph Gw,z: Let w ∈Σ∗
in be any string of length at least 1 and at most
ℓpump. Let z be any non-negative integer. Deﬁne Gw,z = (Gw,z, L) as follows. The graph Gw,z
is a path of the form wr ◦wz ◦wr. The labeling L is a complete labeling of the form f(w)z+2r.
Deﬁne Mid(Gw,z) as the middle subpath wz of Gw,z.
Partially Labeled Graph Gw1,w2,S: Let w1, w2 ∈Σ∗
in be any two strings of length at least 1 and
at most ℓpump. Let S ∈Σ∗
in be any string (can be empty). Deﬁne Gw1,w2,S = (Gw1,w2,S, L) as
follows. The graph Gw1,w2,S is the path of the form wℓpump+2r
1
◦S ◦wℓpump+2r
2
. The labeling
L is a partial labeling of Gw1,w2,S which ﬁxes the output labels of the ﬁrst 2r|w1| and the
last 2r|w2| nodes by f(w1)2r and f(w2)2r, respectively. Deﬁne Mid(Gw1,w2,S) as the middle
subpath wℓpump+r
1
◦S ◦wℓpump+r
2
of Gw1,w2,S.
Feasible Function: We call f a feasible function if the following conditions are met: (i) For each
Gw,z = (Gw,z, L), the complete labeling L is locally consistent at all nodes in Mid(Gw,z). (ii)
Each partially labeled graph Gw1,w2,S admits a complete labeling L⋄that is locally consistent
at all nodes in Mid(Gw1,w2,S).
Lemma 23. Given an LCL problem P on cycle graphs. It is decidable whether there is a feasible
function.
27

--- Page 29 ---
Proof. Note that it is not immediate from its deﬁnition as to whether a feasible function exists is
decidable, since there appears to be inﬁnitely many graphs Gw,z and Gw1,w2,S needed to be examined.
However, the following simple observations show that it suﬃces to check only a constant number of
these graphs.
• If the complete labeling L of Gw,1 = (Gw,1, L) is locally consistent at all nodes in Mid(Gw,1),
then for all z ≥1, the complete labeling L of Gw,z = (Gw,z, L) is also locally consistent at all
nodes in Mid(Gw,z).
• If Gw1,w2,S admits a complete labeling L⋄that is locally consistent at all nodes in Mid(Gw1,w2,S),
then for each S′ such that Type(S) = Type(S′), the partially labeled graph Gw1,w2,S′ also
admits a complete labeling L⋄that is locally consistent at all nodes in Mid(Gw1,w2,S′). This is
due to Lemma 11.
Therefore, to decide whether a function f is feasible, we only need to check all possible Gw,z and
Gw1,w2,S. For each w we only need to consider the graph Gw,z with z = 1. For each w1 and w2, we
do not need to go over all S; we only need to consider (i) the empty string S = ∅, and (ii) for each
type τ, a string S ∈Σ∗
in such that Type(S) = τ. By Lemma 14, for each type τ, there exists P ∈Σx
in
with x ≤ℓpump such that Type(P) = τ. Therefore, a string S with Type(S) = τ can be found in
bounded amount of time; also note that the number of types is bounded; see Lemma 13.
For the rest of this section, we show that as long as the deterministic LOCAL complexity of
P is o(log∗n) on cycle graphs, there exists a feasible function f. In Lemma 24 we show how to
extract a function f from a given o(log∗n)-round deterministic LOCAL algorithm A, and then in
Lemma 25 we prove that such a function f is feasible. Intuitively, Lemma 24 shows that there exists
an ID-assignment such that when we run A on a subpath whose input labeling is a repetition of a
length-k pattern w, the output labeling is also a repetition of a length-k pattern w′. The function f
will be deﬁned as f(w) = w′.
Lemma 24. Let A be any deterministic LOCAL algorithm that solves P in t(n) = o(log∗n) rounds.
Then there is a number n′ and function f which takes a string w ∈Σk
in with 1 ≤k ≤ℓpump as input,
and returns a string f(w) ∈Σk
out meeting the following condition. For any P = wi ◦w2r+1 ◦wi such
that |wi| ≥t(n′) and 1 ≤|w| ≤ℓpump, there is an assignment of distinct Θ(log n′)-bit IDs to the
nodes in P such that the following is true. Simulating A on P while assuming that the total number
of nodes in the underlying graph is n′ yields the output labeling f(w)2r+1 for the middle subpath
w2r+1.
Proof. In this proof we assume that there is no such a number n′. Then we claim that using A it is
possible to obtain a deterministic LOCAL algorithm for MIS on an n-node directed cycle G without
input labeling, in O(t(n)) + O(1) = o(log∗n) rounds. This contradicts the well-known Ω(log∗n)
lower bound for MIS [20].
Let G be an n-node directed cycle without input labeling. The MIS algorithm on G is described
as follows. Let w ∈Σk
in with 1 ≤k ≤ℓpump be chosen such that for any function f, the string
f(w) ∈Σk
out does not satisfy the conditions stated in the lemma for the number n′ = nk. Deﬁne
G′ as the graph resulting from replacing each node v ∈V (G) with a path w. We can simulate the
imaginary graph G′ in the communication network G by letting each node v ∈V (G) simulate a
path w.
We execute the algorithm A on G′ while assuming that the total number of nodes is n′. The
execution takes t(n′) = O(t(n)) rounds. For each node v ∈V (G), deﬁne the color of v as the
sequence of the output labels of the path w2r simulated by the node v and the 2r −1 nodes following
28

--- Page 30 ---
v in the directed cycle G. This gives us a proper O(1)-coloring, since otherwise there must exist
a subpath P = w2r+1 of G′ such that the output labeling of P is of the form y2r+1 for some y,
contradicting our choice of w. Using the standard procedure of computing an MIS from a coloring,
with extra O(1) rounds, an MIS of G can be obtained.
Note that there is a subtle issue about how we set the IDs of nodes in V (G′). The following
method is guaranteed to output distinct IDs. Let v ∈V (G), and let u1, . . . , uk be the nodes in
V (G′) simulated by v. Then we may use ID(ui) = k · ID(v) + i.
Lemma 25. Suppose that the deterministic LOCAL complexity of P is o(log∗n) on cycle graphs.
Then there exists a feasible function f.
Proof. Let A be any deterministic LOCAL algorithm that solves P in t(n) = o(log∗n) rounds. Let
n′ and f be chosen to meet the conditions in Lemma 24 for A. The goal of the proof is to show
that f is a feasible function. According to the conditions speciﬁed in Lemma 24 for the function f,
we already know that the complete labeling L of each Gw,z = (Gw,z, L) is locally consistent at all
nodes in Mid(Gw,z). Therefore, all we need to do is the following. For each partially labeled graph
Gw1,w2,S, ﬁnd a complete labeling L⋄that is locally consistent at all nodes in Mid(Gw1,w2,S).
Given the three parameters w1, w2, and S, deﬁne G as the cycle resulting from linking the
two ends of the path wℓpump
1
◦w2r+1
1
◦wℓpump
1
◦S ◦wℓpump
2
◦w2r+1
2
◦wℓpump
2
. Deﬁne L as the partial
labeling of G which ﬁxes the output labeling of the two subpaths w2r+1
1
and w2r+1
2
by f(w1)2r+1
and f(w2)2r+1, respectively. We write P mid
1
and P mid
2
to denote the two subpaths w2r+1
1
and w2r+1
2
,
respectively.
In what follows, we show that the partially labeled graph G = (G, L) admits a legal labeling L⋄.
Since Gw1,w2,S is a subgraph of G = (G, L), such a legal labeling L⋄is also a complete labeling of
Gw1,w2,S that is locally consistent at all nodes in Mid(Gw1,w2,S).
For the rest of the proof, we show the existence of L⋄. This will be established by applying a
pumping lemma. Deﬁne the graph G′ as the result of the following operations on G.
• Replace the two subpaths wℓpump
1
by wx
1, where the number x is chosen such that x|w1| ≥
2t(n′) + r, and Type(wℓpump
1
) = Type(wx
1).
• Replace the two subpaths wℓpump
2
by wy
2, where the number y is chosen such that y|w2| ≥
2t(n′) + r, and Type(wℓpump
2
) = Type(wy
2).
The existence of the numbers x and y above is guaranteed by Lemma 15. The IDs of nodes in G′ are
assigned as follows. For i = 1, 2, select the IDs of the nodes in S
v∈P mid
i
Nt(n′)(v) in such a way that
the output labeling of P mid
i
resulting from executing A on G′ while assuming that the total number
of nodes is n′ is f(wi)2r+1. The existence of such an ID assignment is guaranteed by Lemma 24. For
all remaining nodes in G′, select their IDs in such a way that all nodes in Nr+t(n′)(v) receive distinct
IDs, for each v ∈V (G′). This ensures that the outcome of executing A on G′ while assuming that
the total number of nodes is n′ is a legal labeling.
Let L′
⋄be the legal labeling of G′ resulting from executing A with the above IDs while pretending
that the total number of nodes is n′. Note that L′
⋄must label P mid
1
and P mid
2
by f(w1)2r+1 and
f(w2)2r+1, respectively. A desired legal labeling L⋄of G can be obtained from the legal labeling L′
⋄of
G′ by applying Lemma 11, as we have Type(wℓpump
1
) = Type(wx
1) and Type(wℓpump
2
) = Type(wy
2).
4.5
The ω(1)—o(log∗n) Gap
In this section we prove that it is decidable whether a given LCL problem P has complexity Ω(log∗n)
or O(1) on cycle graphs.
29

--- Page 31 ---
Lemma 26. Let f be any feasible function. Let G be any cycle graph. Let P be any set of
disjoint subgraphs in G such that the input labeling of each P ∈P is of the form wx such that
x ≥2ℓpump + 2r, and w ∈Σk
in is a string with 1 ≤k ≤ℓpump. For each P ∈P, deﬁne the subgraph
P ′ as follows. If P is a cycle, deﬁne P ′ = P. If P is a path, write P = wℓpump ◦wi ◦wℓpump, and
deﬁne P ′ as the middle subpath wi. Let L be a partial labeling of G deﬁned as follows. For each
P = wx ∈P, ﬁx the output labels of each subpath w of P ′ by f(w). Then G = (G, L) admits a legal
labeling L⋄.
Proof. Deﬁne V1 as the set of all nodes such that v ∈V1 if v belongs to the middle subpath wj
of some path P = wℓpump ◦wr ◦wj ◦wr ◦wℓpump ∈P. By the deﬁnition of feasible function, L is
already locally consistent at all nodes in V1. Thus, all we need to do is to construct a complete
labeling L⋄of G = (G, L), and argue that L⋄is locally consistent at all nodes in V2 = V (G) \ V1.
There are two easy special cases. If P = ∅, then no output label of any node in G is ﬁxed, and
so G trivially admits a legal labeling. If P contains a cycle, then P = {G}, and hence L is already
a legal labeling as V1 = V (G).
In subsequent discussion, we restrict ourselves to the case that P is non-empty and contains only
paths. The output labeling L⋄is constructed as follows. Deﬁne Punlabeled as the maximal-length
subpaths of G that are not assigned any output labels by L. A path P ∈Punlabeled must be of the
form wℓpump
1
◦S ◦wℓpump
2
, where w1, w2 ∈Σ∗
in are two strings of length at least 1 and at most ℓpump,
and S ∈Σ∗
in can be any string (including the empty string). Given P ∈Punlabeled, we make the
following deﬁnitions.
• Deﬁne P + as the subpath of G that includes P and the r|w1| nodes preceding P, and the
r|w2| nodes following P in the graph G. Note that the set V2 is exactly the union of nodes in
P + for all P ∈Punlabeled.
• Deﬁne P ++ as the subpath of G that includes P and the 2r|w1| nodes preceding P, and the
2r|w2| nodes following P in the graph G. The path P ++ must be of the form wℓpump+2r
1
◦S ◦
wℓpump+2r
2
, and the labeling L already ﬁxes the output labels of the ﬁrst 2r|w1| and the last
2r|w2| nodes of P ++ by f(w1)2r and f(w2)2r, respectively.
Observe that the path P ++ = wℓpump+2r
1
◦S ◦wℓpump+2r
2
together with the labeling L is exactly the
partially labeled graph Gw1,w2,S. We assign the output labels to the nodes in P by the labeling
L⋄guaranteed in the deﬁnition of feasible function. It is ensured that the labeling of all nodes
within P + are locally consistent. By doing so for each P ∈Punlabeled, we obtain a desired complete
labeling that is locally consistent at all nodes in V2.
Lemma 27. Suppose that there is a feasible function f for the LCL problem P. Then there is an
O(1)-round deterministic LOCAL algorithm A on cycle graphs.
Proof. The ﬁrst step of the algorithm A is to compute an (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition in O(1)
rounds by Lemma 22. We set ℓcount = 2ℓpump + 2r and ℓwidth = ℓpattern = ℓpump. We assume
|V (G)| > 2ℓwidth. Recall that an (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition decomposes the cycle G into two
sets of disjoint subgraphs Pshort and Plong.
Deﬁne G′ as the graph resulting from applying the following operations on G.
For each
P ∈Pshort, replace the path P by the path P ∗= x ◦yi ◦z such that i = ℓcount, 1 ≤|y| ≤ℓpattern,
and the type of P ∗is the same as the type of P. The path P ∗is obtained via Lemma 14. Note that
each path P ∈Pshort has at least ℓwidth = ℓpump nodes and at most 2ℓwidth = 2ℓpump nodes. Deﬁne
P∗as the set of all P ∗such that P ∈Pshort. The graph G′ is simulated in the communication
graph G by electing a leader for each path P ∈Pshort to simulate P ∗.

Calculate a partial labeling L′ of G′ using the feasible function f as follows. Recall ℓcount =
2ℓpump + 2r. For each P ∗= x ◦yℓpump ◦y2r ◦yℓpump ◦z ∈P∗, label the middle subpath y2r by the
function f. For each P = wℓpump ◦wi ◦wℓpump ∈Plong, label the middle subpath wi by f(w)i. Even
though a path P ∈Plong can have ω(1) nodes, this step can be done locally in O(1) rounds due to
the following property of (ℓwidth, ℓcount, ℓpattern)-partition. All nodes in a path P ∈Plong agree with
the same direction and know the primitive string w.
By Lemma 26, the remaining unlabeled nodes in G′ can be labeled to yield a legal labeling of
G′. This can be done in O(1) rounds since the connected components formed by unlabeled nodes
have at most O(1) nodes. Given any valid labeling of G′, a legal labeling of G can be obtained by
applying Lemma 11 in O(1) rounds. Remember that Type(P) = Type(P ∗) for each P ∈Pshort, and
G′ is exactly the result of replacing each P ∈Pshort by P ∗.
See Figure 5 for an illustration of Lemma 27: (1) applying a pumping lemma to extend each
path P ∈Pshort; (2) labeling the middle subpath y2r of P ∗= x ◦yℓpump ◦y2r ◦yℓpump ◦z ∈P∗and
the middle subpath wj of P ′ = wℓpump ◦wi ◦wℓpump ∈Plong by the function f; (3) the remaining
unlabeled nodes in G′ can be labeled to yield a legal labeling of G′ by Lemma 26; (4) since
Type(P) = Type(P ∗) for each P ∈Pshort, we can recover a legal labeling of G by re-labeling nodes
in each P ∈Pshort.
Combining Lemma 23, Lemma 25, and Lemma 27, we have proved Theorem 9. That is, for any
LCL problem P on cycle graphs, its deterministic LOCAL complexity is either Ω(log∗n) or O(1).
Moreover, there is an algorithm that decides whether P has complexity Ω(log∗n) or O(1) on cycle
graphs; for the case the complexity is O(1), the algorithm outputs a description of an O(1)-round
deterministic LOCAL algorithm that solves P.

High-level: both reports converge on a sensible finite-state (type) abstraction for radius-1, β-normalized LCLs on oriented paths, and on compressing the witnesses for the o(n) and O(1) cases to tables indexed by types. This is the right direction and, if made precise, can plausibly yield a NEXPTIME procedure. However, there are two major correctness gaps that must be fixed to make the approach sound: (i) the append-one-bit transition δ on types must be proved well-defined and computed with the correct boundary-indexing; (ii) composing macro relations R_t across adjacent blocks via an intermediate color m is unsound in general and must be replaced by explicit concatenation at the level of type summaries (Ext tables) to derive the combined block’s summary.

3-row audit table:
| Claim (short) | Status | Why |
| Type count ≤ 16·2^{β^4} (r=1) | OK | Boundary inputs: 2^4 choices; extendibility set over Σ_out^4: ≤2^{β^4}; multiply. Matches standard pumping bounds. |
| δ (append-one-bit) well-defined/computable from Ext | Unclear | Needs a congruence lemma: Type(P)=Type(Q) ⇒ Type(Pa)=Type(Qa). Prover 02’s concrete formula misindexes boundary entries (confuses old second-last vs old last), and Prover 01 leaves cases to be finalized. A correct O(β^5) DP exists but must be stated and proved. |
| Stage-1 bridging via R_t composition with ∃m | Broken | In general, (x,m)∈R_{t_b} and (m,y)∈R_{t_c} does not imply (x,y) is achievable for the concatenation t_b·t_c: the seam requires E(o_R1^b,o_L1^c), not E(o_R1^b,m)∧E(m,o_L1^c). Counterexample: Σ_out={a,b,c}, E={a→b, b→c} only; take t_b forcing its right boundary to a, t_c forcing its left boundary to c. Then choose m=b so both R-conditions hold, but the concatenation needs a→c, which is forbidden. The correct test computes the concatenated summary and checks its R directly. |

Specific to Prover 01:
- Strong: tight state bound; clear DP/BFS plan to enumerate reachable types; the macro R_t definition is fine; attention to reversal is good.
- Issues: δ update is currently underspecified and the sketch mixes up new right-two boundary outputs (should be (old last, new), not (new, ?)). The Stage-1/Stage-2 verifiers rely on composing R_t via an intermediate color m; this is unsound as above. The aside “indeed EXPTIME” is unsubstantiated; existence of a large table is an existential property—without a specialized solver, this is at best NEXPTIME by guessing.

Specific to Prover 02:
- Strong: clean formalization of summaries, and a correct concatenation primitive at the Ext-level; the Stage-1 verifier checks concatenation of summaries (R_B), which avoids the m-composition pitfall. The type-closure DFA construction idea is good.
- Issue: the append-one-bit formula for R′ is incorrect: it treats P′’s right-neighbor (old last) as the third coordinate of R for P; in fact, the new right-two outputs are (old last, new), so for each (o1′,o2′,o3′,o4′) you must check ∃ oldR2 with (o1′,o2′, oldR2, o3′)∈R, E(o3′,o4′), and A_α(o4′).

What to repair and prove next:
1) State and prove the congruence lemma: if Type(P)=Type(Q) then Type(Pa)=Type(Qa), and more generally Summ(P·X) depends only on Summ(P) and Summ(X). This underwrites δ being a function on types and the correctness of concatenation.
2) Give the exact δ recurrence (corrected boundary indexing) and handle k<4 base cases once-and-for-all with a short proof.
3) Replace all uses of “∃m with (x,m)∈R_{t_b} and (m,y)∈R_{t_c}” by: compute the concatenated summary Summ(rep(t_b)·rep(t_c)) and check its R directly.
4) For O(1) vs Ω(log* n), justify rigorously that boundary interfaces (first-two/last-two outputs per type) suffice; i.e., Section 4.4’s construction only needs 2-node boundary consistency and join edges between repeats. If not, augment the witness accordingly.
5) Keep complexity claims conservative: NEXPTIME is supported; EXPTIME would need a deterministic solver for the existential tables (e.g., fixed-point/automata arguments).

Corrections and key lemmas to record

1) Correct append-one-bit recurrence (r=1)
Given a type t with Ext_t ⊆ Σ_out^4 over boundary (L1,L2,R2,R1) and an appended input bit a, the new type t′ has boundary (L1′,L2′,R2′,R1′) = (L1,L2, old R1, new), i.e., R2′ = R1 and R1′ is the label of the appended node. Formally, for each candidate quadruple (x1,x2,x3,x4) ∈ Σ_out^4,
  (x1,x2,x3,x4) ∈ Ext_{t′} ⇔ [x4 ∈ A_a and E(x3,x4) and ∃ z ∈ Σ_out: (x1,x2,z,x3) ∈ Ext_t].
This yields an O(β^5) DP to fill Ext_{t′} by scanning all (x1,x2,x3,x4) and checking ∃z.

Congruence lemma (needed): If Type(P)=Type(Q), then for all a ∈ {0,1}, Type(Pa)=Type(Qa). Proof sketch: The predicate “there exists an interior completion consistent with boundary assignments” over D1∪D2 is preserved under appending one node by the above DP rule, which depends only on Ext_t and a.

2) Concatenation of summaries (r=1)
If Summ(P) has Ext_P and Summ(Q) has Ext_Q, then the concatenation B=P·Q has boundary (P.left endpoint, P.left neighbor, Q.right neighbor, Q.right endpoint) and
  (o1,o2,o3′,o4′) ∈ Ext_B ⇔ ∃ x3,x4,x1′,x2′ ∈ Σ_out: (o1,o2,x3,x4) ∈ Ext_P, (x1′,x2′,o3′,o4′) ∈ Ext_Q, and E(x4,x1′).
Then R_B can be derived from Ext_B as usual.

3) Counterexample to R-composition via ∃m
Let Σ_out={a,b,c}, A_0=A_1=Σ_out. Let E={a→b, b→c} only. Suppose t_b admits a boundary tuple with right endpoint a, and t_c admits a boundary tuple with left endpoint c (interiors arbitrary but extendible). Then choose m=b. We have (x,m) ∈ R_{t_b} for any x with a valid left edge, and (m,y) ∈ R_{t_c} for suitable y. But the concatenation t_b·t_c requires the seam edge a→c, which is forbidden. Hence ∃m composition of R_t is not sound; use Ext-level concatenation and R_B instead.

\title{r=1: precise append-one-bit DP, congruence and concatenation lemmas, and a small counterexample}
\author{(formalization of corrections from notes)}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This note records precise, fully rigorous statements and proofs for the following items that were identified as corrections in the informal notes: (1) the exact append-one-bit dynamic-programming recurrence for the radius-$1$ summaries ("r=1"), including the full boundary indexing and the base cases for short segments (length $k<4$); and the congruence lemma stating that equality of types is preserved under appending a bit; (2) a clean concatenation lemma for Ext-tables (the summary objects used for $r=1$), with proof; (3) a succinct counterexample showing that composing binary relations derived from summaries via an existential intermediate color can be unsound; (4) a revised description of the Stage-1 verifier (and the corresponding Stage-2 checks) that uses concatenation at the Ext-table level rather than composing the two-element relations; and (5) a short complexity remark: we keep claims at the coarse NEXPTIME level unless a deterministic solver is supplied.
\end{abstract}

\section{Preliminaries and notation}

Fix finite alphabets
\[\sigin = \{0,1\},\qquad \sigout\]
and a binary relation (adjacency) \(\Erel\subseteq\sigout\times\sigout\). For each input bit $a\in\sigin$ let $A_a\subseteq\sigout$ be the set of output symbols allowed at a node whose input bit equals $a$ (we allow the natural special case $A_0=A_1=\sigout$). We use $\beta:=|\sigout|$.

A (finite) input segment (bitstring) is $t=t_1t_2\cdots t_k\in\sigin^{k}$ with $k\ge 1$; write $|t|=k$. An \emph{output coloring} of $t$ is a tuple $c=(c_1,\dots,c_k)\in\sigout^{k}$ satisfying the local constraints
\[c_i\in A_{t_i}\quad(1\le i\le k),\qquad\text{and}\qquad (c_i,c_{i+1})\in\Erel\quad(1\le i<k).
\]

For radius $r=1$ we record a summary ("Ext-table") for a segment by the colors that can appear on the two leftmost and two rightmost positions of the segment. The mapping from a full coloring $c$ to its boundary quadruple depends on the segment length $k$ because for short segments some of the positions coincide; we formalize this below.

\begin{definition}[boundary quadruple B_k(c)]\label{def:boundary}
Let $t$ have length $k\ge1$ and let $c=(c_1,\dots,c_k)$ be a coloring of $t$.
Define the boundary quadruple $B_k(c)=(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)\in\sigout^4$ by
\begin{align*}
B_k(c) &= (c_1,c_1,c_1,c_1) &&\text{if }k=1,\\
B_k(c) &= (c_1,c_2,c_1,c_2) &&\text{if }k=2,\\
B_k(c) &= (c_1,c_2,c_2,c_3) &&\text{if }k=3,\\
B_k(c) &= (c_1,c_2,c_{k-1},c_k) &&\text{if }k\ge 4.
\end{align*}
(Thus the quadruple reads ``leftmost, second-from-left, second-from-right, rightmost'', with obvious coincidences when $k<4$.)
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Ext-table]
For a bitstring $t$ of length $k\ge1$ define
\[\Ext_t\;:=\;\{\;B_k(c)\;:\;c\text{ is an output coloring of }t\;\}\;\subseteq\;\sigout^4.
\]
\end{definition}

Intuitively $\Ext_t$ records exactly which assignments to the four boundary positions are extendible to a full coloring of the interior of $t$; for long segments ($k\ge4$) the four positions are distinct.

We will also use, for any set $S\subseteq\sigout^4$, the projections
\begin{align*}
\mathrm{L}(S) &:= \{(x_1,x_2)\;:\;\exists x_3,x_4,\; (x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)\in S\},\\
\mathrm{R}(S) &:= \{(x_3,x_4)\;:\;\exists x_1,x_2,\; (x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)\in S\}.
\end{align*}
For a segment $t$ we abbreviate $\mathrm{R}(\Ext_t)$ by $R_t$ when convenient; this is the set of rightmost pairs that can occur for $t$.

\section{Append-one-bit recurrence and the r=1 congruence lemma}

We first give the elementary base cases for short segments and then the general recurrence for appending a single input bit (the "append-one-bit" DP step). After that we state and prove the congruence lemma (equality of types is preserved by appending a bit).

\subsection{Base cases ($k<4$)}

Let $t$ be a bitstring of length $k\in\{1,2,3\}$. By Definition~\ref{def:boundary} the set $\Ext_t$ has an explicit characterization in terms of small tuples:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item (\emph{Length 1}) If $t=(a)$ then
\[\Ext_t=\{(x,x,x,x)\in\sigout^4:\; x\in A_a\}.\]
\item (\emph{Length 2}) If $t=(a_1,a_2)$ then
\[\Ext_t=\{(x_1,x_2,x_1,x_2)\in\sigout^4:\; x_1\in A_{a_1},\; x_2\in A_{a_2},\; (x_1,x_2)\in\Erel\}.
\]
\item (\emph{Length 3}) If $t=(a_1,a_2,a_3)$ then
\[\Ext_t=\{(x_1,x_2,x_2,x_3)\in\sigout^4:\; x_i\in A_{a_i}\ (i=1,2,3),\; (x_1,x_2)\in\Erel,\; (x_2,x_3)\in\Erel\}.
\]
\end{itemize}

These are immediate from the definition of $B_k(c)$ and from the local adjacency constraints that define a legal coloring.

\subsection{Append-one-bit recurrence (general case $|t|\ge3$)}

Let $t$ be a bitstring of length $k\ge 3$ and let $a\in\sigin$ be a single input bit. Put $t' := t\cdot a$ (appending $a$ on the right). Then $t'$ has length $k+1\ge 4$, so a candidate boundary quadruple for $t'$ is of the form $(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)$ with the usual interpretation.

\begin{proposition}[append-one-bit recurrence for $k\ge3$]\label{prop:append}
With the notation above, for every $(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)\in\sigout^4$ we have
\begin{equation}\label{eq:append-recurrence}
(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)\in\Ext_{t'}\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad x_4\in A_a\;\text{ and }\; (x_3,x_4)\in\Erel\;\text{ and }\;\exists z\in\sigout:\ (x_1,x_2,z,x_3)\in\Ext_t.
\end{equation}
Consequently, given $\Ext_t$ (as a boolean table indexed by $\sigout^4$) one can compute $\Ext_{t'}$ by iterating over all $\beta^4$ candidate quadruples and testing existence of $z$, yielding a naive running time $O(\beta^5)$ for this single append step.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
(=>) Suppose $(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)\in\Ext_{t'}$. By definition there exists a coloring $c_1,\dots,c_{k+1}$ of $t'$ such that $B_{k+1}(c)= (x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)$. Since $k+1\ge 4$ the positions in $B_{k+1}$ are the true positions $1,2,k,k+1$, hence $c_1=x_1$, $c_2=x_2$, $c_k=x_3$, $c_{k+1}=x_4$. From the coloring constraints we get $c_{k+1}\in A_a$ and $(c_k,c_{k+1})=(x_3,x_4)\in\Erel$. Removing the last node yields a coloring $c_1,\dots,c_k$ of $t$, and letting $z:=c_{k-1}$ we have $(x_1,x_2,z,x_3)\in\Ext_t$. This proves the left-to-right implication.

(<=) Conversely suppose $x_4\in A_a$, $(x_3,x_4)\in\Erel$, and there exists $z\in\sigout$ with $(x_1,x_2,z,x_3)\in\Ext_t$. By definition of $\Ext_t$ there exists a coloring $c_1,\dots,c_k$ of $t$ with $c_1=x_1,c_2=x_2,c_{k-1}=z,c_k=x_3$. Appending the color $c_{k+1}:=x_4$ yields a coloring $c_1,\dots,c_{k+1}$ of $t'$ (by $x_4\in A_a$ and $(x_3,x_4)\in\Erel$), and the boundary quadruple of this coloring is $(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)$ because $k+1\ge 4$. Hence $(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)\in\Ext_{t'}$.

The asymptotic cost statement is immediate from the recurrence: evaluating the right-hand side of (\ref{eq:append-recurrence}) for every $\beta^4$-many quadruples costs $O(\beta)$ to check the existential over $z$ in the naive implementation, hence $O(\beta^5)$ time per append.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Append-one-bit: the $k<4$ cases}

When $|t|<4$ the quadruples in $\Ext_t$ encode coinciding positions, therefore the recurrence in Proposition~\ref{prop:append} must be replaced by the appropriate base-case to get a correct algorithm that builds up from length~1. We spell these out as constructive update rules that compute $\Ext_{t'}$ from $\Ext_t$ when $|t|=1,2,3$.

Let $t$ have length $k\in\{1,2,3\}$ and let $t'=t\cdot a$.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item If $k=1$ then $t=(b)$ for some $b\in\sigin$. Using the characterization above we have
\[\Ext_t=\{(x,x,x,x):x\in A_b\}.
\]
Hence $t'$ has length 2 and
\[(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)\in\Ext_{t'}\iff x_1=x_3,\; x_2=x_4,\; x_1\in A_b,\; x_2\in A_a,\; (x_1,x_2)\in\Erel.
\]
(Operationally: enumerate $x_1,x_2$ with $(x_1,x_2)\in\Erel$, check $x_1\in A_b$ and $x_2\in A_a$, and add the quadruple $(x_1,x_2,x_1,x_2)$.)

\item If $k=2$ then $t=(b_1,b_2)$, and $\Ext_t$ consists of tuples $(x_1,x_2,x_1,x_2)$ with adjacency $ (x_1,x_2)\in\Erel$ and membership $x_i\in A_{b_i}$. The appened string $t'$ has length $3$, and
\[(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)\in\Ext_{t'}\iff x_3=x_2,\; x_1\in A_{b_1},\; x_2\in A_{b_2}\cap A_a,\; (x_1,x_2)\in\Erel,\; (x_2,x_4)\in\Erel.
\]
(Equivalently, set $c_1=x_1,c_2=x_2,c_3=x_4$ and check the two edges and membership.)

\item If $k=3$ then $t=(b_1,b_2,b_3)$ and $\Ext_t$ has tuples of the form $(x_1,x_2,x_2,x_3)$ satisfying the two edges $(x_1,x_2)$ and $(x_2,x_3)$. Appending $a$ produces length $4$, and the characterization is
\[(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)\in\Ext_{t'}\iff x_1\in A_{b_1},\; x_2\in A_{b_2},\; x_3\in A_{b_3},\; x_4\in A_a,\; (x_1,x_2)\in\Erel,\; (x_2,x_3)\in\Erel,\; (x_3,x_4)\in\Erel.
\]
\end{itemize}

These formulas are the only special cases one needs when implementing a forward DP that starts from single-bit segments and builds up by repeated appends: for $k\ge3$ use Proposition~\ref{prop:append}, and for $k\in\{1,2,3\}$ use the explicit checks above.

\subsection{Congruence lemma (r=1)}

We now state and prove the congruence property that was needed in the notes: if two segments have identical Ext-tables then appending the same input bit to both yields identical Ext-tables again.

\begin{lemma}[r=1 congruence lemma]\label{lem:congruence}
Let $P,Q$ be two bitstrings and suppose $\Ext_P=\Ext_Q$. Then for every bit $a\in\sigin$ we have
\[\Ext_{P\cdot a}=\Ext_{Q\cdot a}.\]
In particular, equality of the $r=1$ summaries (Ext-tables) is preserved by appending a single input bit.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The proof is a simple case analysis using the append-one-bit rules.

If $|P|\ge 3$ then the formula in Proposition~\ref{prop:append} expresses membership in $\Ext_{P\cdot a}$ purely in terms of membership in $\Ext_P$, the sets $A_a$, and the adjacency relation $\Erel$; the same formula holds for $Q$ because $|Q|$ must be equal to $|P|$ whenever $\Ext_P=\Ext_Q$ (indeed the pattern of coincidences in quadruples for short lengths is visible in the table itself). Thus the right-hand side of (\ref{eq:append-recurrence}) is identical for $P$ and $Q$, which yields $\Ext_{P\cdot a}=\Ext_{Q\cdot a}$.

If $|P|<3$ then both $P$ and $Q$ must have the same length (because their Ext-tables record the equality patterns of the coordinates: e.g. membership of tuples of the form $(x,x,x,x)$ witnesses $k=1$, etc.). In each of the finite cases $k=1,2,3$ the explicit base-case update rules given above determine $\Ext_{\cdot a}$ from $\Ext_{\cdot}$ using only membership tests that depend on $\Ext_P$ and the fixed parameters $A_a,\Erel$. Since $\Ext_P=\Ext_Q$ the resulting computations yield the same set. This finishes the proof.
\end{proof}

\section{Concatenation lemma for Ext-tables}

Concatenation is the other fundamental operation we need. We give a clean statement that directly tells how to compute $\Ext_{P\cdot Q}$ from $\Ext_P$ and $\Ext_Q$ (no intermediate projection to binary relations is needed or used). The statement is valid for all lengths $|P|,|Q|\ge 1$; the proof is a straightforward gluing argument.

\begin{lemma}[concatenation lemma for Ext-tables]\label{lem:concat}
Let $P$ and $Q$ be bitstrings of lengths $m, n\ge1$, respectively, and let $B:=P\cdot Q$ be their concatenation (length $m+n$). Then for any $(o_1,o_2,o_3',o_4')\in\sigout^4$ we have
\begin{multline}\label{eq:concat}
(o_1,o_2,o_3',o_4')\in\Ext_B\\\iff\exists\;x_3,x_4,x_1',x_2'\in\sigout\;:\; (o_1,o_2,x_3,x_4)\in\Ext_P,\; (x_1',x_2',o_3',o_4')\in\Ext_Q,\;\text{and }(x_4,x_1')\in\Erel.
\end{multline}
In words: a boundary quadruple appears for the concatenation exactly when there exist matching interior boundary pairs for the left and right factors whose seam colors are adjacent.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
(=>) Suppose $(o_1,o_2,o_3',o_4')\in\Ext_B$. Then by definition there exists a coloring $c_1,\dots,c_{m+n}$ of $B$ whose boundary quadruple (according to Definition~\ref{def:boundary} with length $m+n$) equals $(o_1,o_2,o_3',o_4')$. Restrict the coloring to the left factor $P$ to obtain $c_1,\dots,c_m$, and to the right factor $Q$ (with renumbering) to obtain $c_{m+1},\dots,c_{m+n}$. Let
\[x_3:=c_{\max(1,m-1)},\quad x_4:=c_m,\quad x_1':=c_{m+1},\quad x_2':=c_{\min(m+2,m+n)}
\]
(so that the four symbols $x_3,x_4,x_1',x_2'$ are precisely the two rightmost symbols of $P$ and the two leftmost symbols of $Q$, with the appropriate coincidences for short factors). By construction $(o_1,o_2,x_3,x_4)\in\Ext_P$ and $(x_1',x_2',o_3',o_4')\in\Ext_Q$. Finally the adjacency across the seam is $(x_4,x_1')=(c_m,c_{m+1})\in\Erel$ because the coloring of $B$ satisfied all adjacent-edge constraints. This proves the forward implication.

(<=) Conversely, assume there exist $x_3,x_4,x_1',x_2'$ as in the right-hand side of (\ref{eq:concat}). By $(o_1,o_2,x_3,x_4)\in\Ext_P$ there exists a coloring $p_1,\dots,p_m$ of $P$ whose left/right boundary pattern matches $(o_1,o_2,x_3,x_4)$. Likewise from $(x_1',x_2',o_3',o_4')\in\Ext_Q$ there exists a coloring $q_1,\dots,q_n$ of $Q$ whose left/right boundary pattern matches $(x_1',x_2',o_3',o_4')$. The assumed seam adjacency $(x_4,x_1')\in\Erel$ guarantees that the two colorings can be glued along the seam edge between positions $m$ and $m+1$: define a coloring of $B$ by
\[c_i := p_i\ (1\le i\le m),\qquad c_{m+j} := q_j\ (1\le j\le n).
\]
The adjacency conditions inside $P$ and inside $Q$ are satisfied by $p$ and $q$; the single new adjacency to check is $(c_m,c_{m+1})=(x_4,x_1')$, which holds by hypothesis. Therefore $c_1,\dots,c_{m+n}$ is a legal coloring of $B$ whose boundary quadruple equals $(o_1,o_2,o_3',o_4')$, whence $(o_1,o_2,o_3',o_4')\in\Ext_B$. This completes the proof of the equivalence.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
Note that the existential quantification ranges only over four symbols from $\sigout$; a naive implementation of (\ref{eq:concat}) would therefore take time $O(\beta^8)$ to produce the full $\Ext_B$ table by trying all $(o_1,o_2,o_3',o_4')$ and all witnesses $x_3,x_4,x_1',x_2'$. In practice one can do significantly better (e.g. by iterating witnesses $x_4,x_1'$ first and using precomputed adjacency lists) but the point for correctness is that concatenation is computable entirely from the two operand Ext-tables and the adjacency $\Erel$.
\end{remark}

\section{Why composing $R_t$ via an existential intermediate color is unsound (a short counterexample)}

It is tempting to try to speed up concatenation by passing to the binary projection $R_t=\mathrm{R}(\Ext_t)$ (the rightmost pair) and to define the right-projection of a concatenation by composing these binary relations via an existential intermediate color $m\in\sigout$, i.e.
\[R_{P\cdot Q}?=\{(u,w):\exists m\in\sigout,\; (u,m)\in R_P\;\text{and}\;(m,w)\in R_Q\}.
\]
We give a brief counterexample showing this is unsound in general: the right-projection of the concatenation can be strictly smaller than the projection obtained by composing the $R$-relations in the above way.

\begin{proposition}[counterexample]\label{prop:counter}
Let $\sigout=\{a,b,c\}$, $A_0=A_1=\sigout$, and let the adjacency relation be
\[\Erel=\{(a,b),(b,c)\}.
\]
Let $P$ and $Q$ both be the two-bit segment $\mathtt{00}$ (length~2). Then
\begin{itemize}
\item $R_P$ contains the pair $(a,b)$ (witnessing the extension $a\!\mapsto b$ on the two nodes of $P$), and $R_Q$ contains the pair $(b,c)$.
\item Hence the existential composition yields the pair $(a,c)$ via the intermediate color $m=b$.
\item However $(a,c)\notin R_{P\cdot Q}$, i.e. there is no extension of the length-4 segment $P\cdot Q$ whose rightmost coordinate is $c$ while the leftmost coordinate is $a$; consequently the composition above is unsound.
\end{itemize}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
For $P=\mathtt{00}$ (two bits) a legal coloring is a pair $(x_1,x_2)\in\sigout^2$ with $(x_1,x_2)\in\Erel$. Thus $\Ext_P$ contains tuples of the form $(x_1,x_2,x_1,x_2)$ exactly when $(x_1,x_2)\in\Erel$. In particular $(a,b,a,b)\in\Ext_P$, so $R_P$ contains the rightmost pair $(a,b)$. Similarly $(b,c,b,c)\in\Ext_Q$ so $R_Q$ contains $(b,c)$.

The existential composition of $R_P$ and $R_Q$ therefore contains $(a,c)$ because there exists $m=b$ with $(a,b)\in R_P$ and $(b,c)\in R_Q$.

But consider the concatenation $B:=P\cdot Q$, which has length $4$. A coloring of $B$ is a tuple $(y_1,y_2,y_3,y_4)$ with $(y_1,y_2),(y_2,y_3),(y_3,y_4)\in\Erel$. If $y_1=a$ then the only possibility for $y_2$ is $b$ (because the only outgoing edge from $a$ is to $b$). Then $y_3$ must be $c$ (because the only outgoing edge from $b$ is to $c$). But there is no outgoing edge from $c$ in $\Erel$, so there is no symbol $y_4$ with $(y_3,y_4)=(c,y_4)\in\Erel$. Consequently there is no coloring of $B$ with $y_1=a$ and $y_4=c$; hence $(a,c)$ does not occur as the rightmost pair in any entry of $\Ext_B$. That is, $(a,c)\notin R_{P\cdot Q}$, completing the counterexample.
\end{proof}

This simple example illustrates that projecting summaries (here to $R_t$) and then composing those projections by existentially quantifying over a single intermediate color may produce spurious pairs: the existential witness $m$ might be realized in different global extensions of the two factors that are incompatible at the seam. The correct (sound) operation is concatenation at the Ext-table level (Lemma~\ref{lem:concat}) which enforces seam adjacency while keeping the two-sided context.

\section{Rewriting the verifier specification: use concatenation, not $R$-composition}

Below we give a concise, explicit rewrite of the Stage-1 verifier specification (and the corresponding Stage-2 checks) so that every place that previously composed $R$-relations via an existential intermediate color is replaced by a concatenation of Ext-tables followed by a projection to $R$ if needed.

The description below is intentionally modular and abstract (it operates on the certificate objects the prover supplies). It is stated so that it is immediately implementable using the formulas in Lemma~\ref{lem:concat} and Proposition~\ref{prop:append}.

\subsection*{Inputs to the verifier}

The verifier receives (from the prover/certificate) the following finite objects:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item A finite set $\mathcal{R}$ of representative bitstrings (the claimed representatives of the finitely many types used by the proof). Each $\rho\in\mathcal{R}$ is a bitstring in $\sigin^*$.
\item For each representative $\rho\in\mathcal{R}$ a table $\Ext^{\mathrm{cert}}_{\rho}\subseteq\sigout^4$ claimed to equal the true $\Ext_{\rho}$.
\item A finite set of claims (rules) of the form "the concatenation of representatives $\rho_b,\rho_c$ has representative $\rho_{bc}$"; for each such claim the certificate may also furnish (or one can derive) the asserted relation $R^{\mathrm{cert}}_{\rho_{bc}}:=\mathrm{R}(\Ext^{\mathrm{cert}}_{\rho_{bc}})$ if that is part of the witnessed invariant in the original scheme.
\end{itemize}

The verifier's job is to check that the supplied Ext-tables are self-consistent and closed under the operations (append, concatenation) required by the scheme. It performs the following checks.

\subsection*{Stage-1 verifier (using concatenation)}\label{sec:stage1}

For every asserted concatenation claim $(\rho_b,\rho_c,\rho_{bc})$ do the following checks:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item Let $P:=\rho_b$ and $Q:=\rho_c$, and compute the candidate concatenation table
\[\Ext^{\mathrm{comp}}_{P\cdot Q} := \{\; (o_1,o_2,o_3',o_4')\in\sigout^4:\;\exists x_3,x_4,x_1',x_2'\in\sigout\ \text{s.t.}\ (o_1,o_2,x_3,x_4)\in\Ext^{\mathrm{cert}}_{P},\ (x_1',x_2',o_3',o_4')\in\Ext^{\mathrm{cert}}_{Q},\ (x_4,x_1')\in\Erel\;\}.
\]
(Use the formula of Lemma~\ref{lem:concat}.)

\item Compute the projected right relation
\[R^{\mathrm{comp}}_{P\cdot Q} := \mathrm{R}(\Ext^{\mathrm{comp}}_{P\cdot Q}).\]

\item Verify that the certificate's claimed representative $\rho_{bc}$ satisfies
\[R^{\mathrm{cert}}_{\rho_{bc}} = R^{\mathrm{comp}}_{P\cdot Q}\qquad\text{and}\qquad \Ext^{\mathrm{cert}}_{\rho_{bc}} = \Ext^{\mathrm{comp}}_{P\cdot Q}\] if the certificate supplies $\Ext^{\mathrm{cert}}_{\rho_{bc}}$ explicitly. (At minimum the verifier must check that the representative's stored relation/table agrees with the one computed by concatenation; checking equality of the full Ext-tables is sound and recommended.)
\end{enumerate}

Remarks:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item The crucial change compared to the earlier, unsound specification is that the verifier \emph{does not} compute $R^{\mathrm{comp}}_{P\cdot Q}$ simply as $\{(u,w):\exists m,\,(u,m)\in R^{\mathrm{cert}}_P\land(m,w)\in R^{\mathrm{cert}}_Q\}$. Instead the verifier constructs the full $\Ext$-table by concatenation and only then projects to $R$.
\item If the certificate does not explicitly supply $\Ext^{\mathrm{cert}}_{\rho_{bc}}$ but does claim the representative $\rho_{bc}$, the verifier may still compute $\Ext^{\mathrm{comp}}_{P\cdot Q}$ and check that $R^{\mathrm{comp}}_{P\cdot Q}$ equals the stored $R^{\mathrm{cert}}_{\rho_{bc}}$. This is sufficient to guarantee that the claimed representative behaves correctly as far as the right projection is concerned.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Adjustments in Stage-2 checks}

Any Stage-2 check that previously reasoned about the compatibility of two representatives by composing their $R$-relations must be replaced by the corresponding check that computes the concatenation Ext-table and then performs the required membership or projection tests on $\Ext^{\mathrm{comp}}_{P\cdot Q}$. Concretely, whenever the verifier earlier intended to test
\[\exists m\in\sigout:\ (u,m)\in R_P\land(m,w)\in R_Q
\]
it should instead test (by computing $\Ext^{\mathrm{comp}}_{P\cdot Q}$) whether there exists a quadruple in $\Ext^{\mathrm{comp}}_{P\cdot Q}$ whose left projection matches the left context (as required) and whose right projection produces the desired $(u,w)$ outcome; equivalently, test membership in $R^{\mathrm{comp}}_{P\cdot Q}$.

This substitution is sound by Lemma~\ref{lem:concat} and avoids the spurious pairs that may be produced by existentially composing $R$-relations alone (see Proposition~\ref{prop:counter}).

\section{Complexity remark}

We refrain from attempting a tighter complexity analysis in this note. The elementary operations on Ext-tables that we used above have the following simple size bounds:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Each $\Ext_t$ is a subset of $\sigout^4$ and hence can be represented in size $O(\beta^4)$. The projections $R_t$ and $L_t$ have size $O(\beta^2)$.
\item The naive append-one-bit step (Proposition~\ref{prop:append}) takes $O(\beta^5)$ time in the worst case per append when implemented by brute-force enumeration of all quadruples and the existential witness.
\item The naive concatenation step (Lemma~\ref{lem:concat}) can be implemented by checking all $\beta^4$ candidate output quadruples and, for each, all $\beta^4$ possible witnesses $x_3,x_4,x_1',x_2'$, hence $O(\beta^8)$ time in the worst-case with a fully naive method; modest algorithmic improvements reduce this significantly in practice (for instance by iterating seam colors $x_4,x_1'$ first and using lookups), but we do not rely on such micro-optimizations here.
\end{itemize}

Because the verifier is supplied with a (potentially exponentially large) nondeterministic certificate of representatives and Ext-tables, and because checking the correctness of the certificate requires the potentially expensive concatenation operations above, the natural coarse-grained upper bound to assert without further assumptions is NEXPTIME: a nondeterministic verifier can guess the certificate and then perform the table computations and equality checks in time exponential in the size of the original problem description. If, however, a deterministic (polynomial-time, or otherwise bounded-time) solver for the small constraint checks is provided as an oracle, the complexity claims can be made correspondingly stronger; in this note we intentionally keep the complexity statement at the NEXPTIME level since no such deterministic subroutine is assumed.

\section{Conclusion}

We summarized and proved the corrected append-one-bit recurrence (including the full $k<4$ base cases), proved the r=1 congruence lemma, gave a clean concatenation lemma for Ext-tables, displayed a simple counterexample showing that composing $R$-relations via an existential intermediate color is unsound, and rewrote the Stage-1 verifier specification (and the Stage-2 checks) so that concatenation at the Ext-table level is used in place of the unsound $R$-composition. The small explicit counterexample (Section~\ref{prop:counter}) demonstrates why the change is necessary in any implementation or formal verification of the scheme.
