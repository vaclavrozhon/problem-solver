  "summary_md": "Round 0002: fixed the r=1 DP and repaired verifier soundness. Derived an exact append-one-bit recurrence for Ext-tables with explicit k=1,2,3 base cases and proved append-congruence (with the practical caveat that types must carry a k_flag for short lengths). Replaced the unsound R-composition by an Ext-level concatenation lemma and supplied a minimal 3-symbol counterexample (a\u2192b\u2192c). Gave a deterministic BFS to enumerate reachable types (type = (b_in, Ext, k_flag)), bounded |T| \u2264 16\u00b72^{\u03b2^4} and O(\u03b2^5) per-append, so preprocessing is 2^{poly(N)}. Rewrote both NEXPTIME verifiers (\u03a9(n) vs o(n) and O(1) vs \u03a9(log* n)) to use Ext-concatenation with explicit universal checks and provided pseudocode. Remaining polishing: fix the k=2 base-case wording, add unit/regression tests, and complete a full equivalence proof for the boundary-interface witness. Files: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json (Round 0002) and verifier summary.",
