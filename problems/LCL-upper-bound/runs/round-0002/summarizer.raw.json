Derived an exact append-one-bit recurrence for Ext-tables with explicit k=1,2,3 base cases and proved append-congruence (with the practical caveat that types must carry a k_flag for short lengths). Replaced the unsound R-composition by an Ext-level concatenation lemma and supplied a minimal 3-symbol counterexample (a→b→c). Gave a deterministic BFS to enumerate reachable types (type = (b_in, Ext, k_flag)), bounded |T| ≤ 16·2^{β^4} and O(β^5) per-append, so preprocessing is 2^{poly(N)}. Rewrote both NEXPTIME verifiers (Ω(n) vs o(n) and O(1) vs Ω(log* n)) to use Ext-concatenation with explicit universal checks and provided pseudocode. Remaining polishing: fix the k=2 base-case wording, add unit/regression tests, and complete a full equivalence proof for the boundary-interface witness.
