This round closes two formalization gaps from outputs.pdf and records an optimization. Stage-1: a type-level feasible-function f : T × {0,1}^2 × T → Σ_out^2 is defined with (i) local node constraints and (ii) a universal Ext-concatenation membership condition across separators; existence of f is verifiable in NEXPTIME by computing T and Ext-tables and nondeterministically guessing f. The definition is argued equivalent to the paper’s feasible function (both directions). Stage-2: each type τ gets a boundary-interface witness Q_τ=(L1,L2,R2,R1) with checks (a) local tiling via Ext_τ and wrap-around E, and (b) bridging across any middle type τ_S via Ext membership; if all checks pass the instance is O(1), if Stage-1 passes but Stage-2 fails it’s Θ(log* n), else Θ(n). Optimization: concatenation time reduced from O(β^8) to O(β^6) by precomputing Left/Right 3D slices per type. Examples and endpoint/orientation notes included. Next steps identify formal proofs, the faster routine, and a small regression suite. Citations: prover-01.out.json (progress_md), outputs.pdf.
