  "summary_md": "Round 0004 audit: outputs.md now records the core r=1 ingredients with complete proofs for the high-k append recurrence (k_flag\u22654), Ext-level concatenation, congruence (type preserved under append), an explicit counterexample showing R-composition via \u2203m is unsound, and an O(\u03b2^6) concatenation routine via 3D slices. Missing/needed pieces were identified and concrete additions proposed: an explicit k=1\u21922 base rule to seed the DP; a deterministic BFS enumeration of Types T and a proof that \u03b4 is well-defined with complexity bounds; a reversal operator Rev(\u00b7); precise Stage-1 (feasible table f and the o(n)\u21d4existence-of-f equivalence checked via Ext_{\u03c4\u2299\u03c3}); precise Stage-2 (per-type witnesses Q_\u03c4, universal bridging checks, and a constant-round construction); optional Ext_{\u2205} handling; small sanity/regression tests and an appendix with O(\u03b2^6) implementation details. Action items: promote sections 1\u20135 into outputs.md, add the concatenation appendix, and add regressions (\u03b2\u2208{2,3}).

  "highlights": [
    "Completed primitives: append-one-bit recurrence for k_flag\u22654; Ext concatenation lemma; congruence lemma; explicit counterexample to R-composition via \u2203m; O(\u03b2^6) concatenation implementation sketch.",
    "Concrete missing base-case fixed: propose explicit k=1\u21922 rule (Ext_{(b,a)} = {(x,y,x,y): x\u2208A_b, y\u2208A_a, E(x,y)}) to complement k=2\u21923 and seed the append DP.",
    "Type-count and enumeration: establish |T| \u2264 16\u00b72^{\u03b2^4}; BFS enumeration over Types with \u03b4 determined by Type and appended bit; total preprocessing time/space 2^{poly(\u03b2)} and per-append O(\u03b2^5).",
    "Stage-1 formalized: feasible table f : T\u00d7{0,1}^2\u00d7T\u2192\u03a3_out^2 with local legality and universal Ext-based seam witness; theorem: deterministic complexity o(n) on oriented paths iff such an f exists; verification in NEXPTIME.",
    "Stage-2 formalized: per-type witnesses Q_\u03c4\u2208Ext_\u03c4 for k_flag\u22654, tiling and middle-bridging checks (a)\u2013(b); yields an O(1)-round deterministic labeling when satisfied; verification in NEXPTIME.",
    "Practical additions: Rev(\u00b7) operator to avoid seam-indexing errors, optional Ext_{\u2205} convention, sanity checks (including 3-color counterexample), and a proposal for a small regression suite (\u03b2=2,3)."

  "next_questions": [
    "Add the k=1\u21922 base-case rule and its short proof + regression tests (\u03b2\u2208{2,3}); verify it seeds the DP together with the existing k=2\u21923 rule.",
    "Formalize and insert the BFS enumeration proposition for Types (\u03b4 well-defined), include explicit complexity bounds and an API sketch for Ext, Left/Right and cached concatenation (O(\u03b2^6) details).",
    "Write the full Stage-1 equivalence proof (o(n) \u21d4 feasible f) specialized to oriented paths and the Stage-2 constant-radius partition proof (fix constants \u2113_pump, \u2113_count, \u2113_width) and add these to outputs.md."
