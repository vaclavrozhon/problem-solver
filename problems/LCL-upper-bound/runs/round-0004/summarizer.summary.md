Round 0004 audit: outputs.md now records the core r=1 ingredients with complete proofs for the high-k append recurrence (k_flag≥4), Ext-level concatenation, congruence (type preserved under append), an explicit counterexample showing R-composition via ∃m is unsound, and an O(β^6) concatenation routine via 3D slices. Missing/needed pieces were identified and concrete additions proposed: an explicit k=1→2 base rule to seed the DP; a deterministic BFS enumeration of Types T and a proof that δ is well-defined with complexity bounds; a reversal operator Rev(·); precise Stage-1 (feasible table f and the o(n)⇔existence-of-f equivalence checked via Ext_{τ⊙σ}); precise Stage-2 (per-type witnesses Q_τ, universal bridging checks, and a constant-round construction); optional Ext_{∅} handling; small sanity/regression tests and an appendix with O(β^6) implementation details. Action items: promote sections 1–5 into outputs.md, add the concatenation appendix, and add regressions (β∈{2,3}). Citations: prover-01.out.json (progress_md); outputs.md (Round 0004).
