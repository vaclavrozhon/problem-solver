  "summary_md": "This round produced a near-complete specification and verification plan for the r=1 oriented-path decision procedure. Key additions: a computable pumping bound \u2113_pump := |T| with two pumping lemmas (prefix and periodic) that let us normalize and lengthen contexts while preserving Types; a general Ext-concatenation lemma (handles short k_flag types) plus associativity and a monotonicity lemma; a Stage-1 theorem S1 equating o(n) complexity with existence of a feasible per-type function f over long types T_long (k_flag\u22654), together with an O(log* n) construction and NEXPTIME verifier; and a Stage-2 theorem S2 showing that per-type boundary interfaces Q_\u03c4 certify O(1) solvability, with bridging checks that use Ext tables and handle short middle types. Implementation notes cover restricting left/right quantification to T_long, precomputing/caching Ext tables, and verifier complexity (2^{poly(\u03b2)}). The verifier returned success. Next steps focus on integrating the lemmas and adding the MIS/partition appendix and regression tests.",
  "highlights": [
    "Defined \u2113_pump := |T| and proved two pumping lemmas (P1 prefix pumping, P2 periodic pumping) ensuring Type-invariance under repeated segments \u2014 enables length-normalization and spacing of separators.",
    "General concatenation Lemma C (Ext_{P\u00b7Q} characterized for all k_flag values) and associativity Lemma A; Monotonicity Lemma M gives a simple nonemptiness diagnostic when seams can be matched.",
    "Stage-1 (Theorem S1): on oriented paths, deterministic complexity is o(n) iff a feasible function f : T_long \u00d7 {0,1}^2 \u00d7 T_long \u2192 \u03a3_out^2 exists. Feasibility reduces to checking Ext_{\u03c4\u2299\u03c3} membership; yields an O(log* n) constructive algorithm and NEXPTIME verification.",
    "Stage-2 (Theorem S2): if per-type interfaces Q_\u03c4\u2208Ext_\u03c4 satisfy tiling and universal-bridging constraints (using Ext for arbitrary middle \u03c4_S), there is an O(1)-round algorithm; checks are verifiable in 2^{poly(\u03b2)} time.",
    "Complexity facts: |T| \u2264 4\u00b72^{\u03b2^4}; BFS and Ext-table precomputation in 2^{poly(\u03b2)}; verifier checks (Stage-1/2) run in 2^{poly(\u03b2)} with recommended caching of Ext lookups.",
    "Short-type seams are handled by Lemma C, allowing Stage-2 bridging constraints to quantify over arbitrary middle types while restricting left/right contexts to T_long; seam indexing convention (L1,L2,R2,R1) clarified.",
    "Citations: relied on prover-01.out.json (progress_md) and the Verifier outputs (verdict: success)."

  "next_questions": [
    "Integrate Lemmas P1, P2, C, A, M and Theorems S1, S2 into output.md with concise proofs and explicitly define \u2113_pump := |T| (computability note: 2^{poly(\u03b2)}).",
    "Amend Stage-1/Stage-2 verifier specifications to quantify left/right over T_long, use Ext_{\u03c4_S} for arbitrary middle types, and add explicit seam-indexing conventions and caching/precomputation plans.",
    "Add the MIS-based O(log* n) separator placement and the constant-radius partition appendix (parameters and radii) and implement the small regression suite (\u03b2\u2208{2,3}) to test pumping, associativity, and Stage-1/2 classification."
