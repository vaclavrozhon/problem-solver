This round produced a near-complete specification and verification plan for the r=1 oriented-path decision procedure. Key additions: a computable pumping bound ℓ_pump := |T| with two pumping lemmas (prefix and periodic) that let us normalize and lengthen contexts while preserving Types; a general Ext-concatenation lemma (handles short k_flag types) plus associativity and a monotonicity lemma; a Stage-1 theorem S1 equating o(n) complexity with existence of a feasible per-type function f over long types T_long (k_flag≥4), together with an O(log* n) construction and NEXPTIME verifier; and a Stage-2 theorem S2 showing that per-type boundary interfaces Q_τ certify O(1) solvability, with bridging checks that use Ext tables and handle short middle types. Implementation notes cover restricting left/right quantification to T_long, precomputing/caching Ext tables, and verifier complexity (2^{poly(β)}). The verifier returned success. Next steps focus on integrating the lemmas and adding the MIS/partition appendix and regression tests.
