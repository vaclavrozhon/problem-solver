  "summary_md": "Round 0006 audited output.md and supplied small lemmas, implementation optimizations, and sanity checks to close minor gaps in the Stage\u20111 machinery. Main fixes: rewrite the \u03b4 base case for k_flag=1 using S_\u03c4 (Lemma A) so it does not rely on recovering an internal bit; add an endpoint-completion lemma to close the Stage\u20111 (\u21d0) construction for finite directed paths (Lemma B); and rephrase feasible-function verification to quantify only over attainable seam-color sets (Lemma C). An important implementation speedup reduces append from O(\u03b2^5) to O(\u03b2^4) by precomputing 3D Left3 slices, and further preprocessing of seam-feasibility matrices W_{b\u2299c} moves heavy tuple scanning into preprocessing. Sanity checks on equality LCL and 2\u2011coloring were noted and an actionable checklist of edits and regression tests was supplied. The Verifier returned an \"uncertain\" verdict. Next work: apply the documented edits, run regression tests, and resolve Stage\u20112 (partition lemma vs certificate redesign).\n\nCitations: prover-01.out.json (progress_md, Round 0006); output.md; Verifier (verdict).",
  "highlights": [
    "Lemma A (\u03b4 base k_flag=1): replace reference to recovered bit b with S_\u03c4 := {x : (x,x,x,x) \u2208 Ext_\u03c4}; Ext_{\u03b4(\u03c4,a)} then characterized directly via S_\u03c4 and A_a.",
    "Lemma B (endpoint completion): end segments between a path endpoint and the nearest separator admit legal completions consistent with the separator seam color, closing a small gap in the Stage\u20111 (\u21d0) proof for finite directed paths.",
    "Lemma C (quantifier minimization): verification of a guessed f can be reformulated to range over attainable seam\u2011color sets OutR2 and OutL1, eliminating explicit quantification over \u03c4_a,\u03c4_d and simplifying loops.",
    "Append optimization: for k_flag\u22654 precompute Left3 (\u03b2^3 tensor) to bring append runtime from O(\u03b2^5) down to O(\u03b2^4) (dense worst case O(\u03b2^4 + \u03b2^3\u00b7\u0394)).",
    "Precompute seam\u2011feasibility matrices W_{b\u2299c} (\u03b2\u00d7\u03b2) so Stage\u20111 verification reduces to table lookups; heavy scanning of Ext is moved into preprocessing (computed in O(\u03b2^4\u00b7\u0394^2) or faster with sparsity).",
    "Concrete action checklist provided: amend Proposition 9, add Lemma B, add O(\u03b2^4) append optimization, optionally integrate Lemma C and W precomputation, and postpone Stage\u20112 until partition lemma or certificate redesign is chosen."

  "next_questions": [
    "Edit output.md: rewrite Proposition 9 for k_flag=1 using S_\u03c4, insert Lemma B (endpoint completion), and add the O(\u03b2^4) append optimization proposition; optionally incorporate Lemma C and note W_{b\u2299c} precomputation.",
    "Run regression tests on small alphabets (|\u03a3_out|\u22643): verify O(\u03b2^4) append agrees with brute force, check Ext-concatenation associativity, validate W_{b\u2299c} against direct Ext scans, and confirm Stage\u20111 acceptance/rejection on known instances (equality LCL, 2\u2011coloring, degenerate A_0=A_1).",
    "Resolve Stage\u20112 approach: either provide a constant-radius partition lemma for oriented paths (with parameters and proof) or redesign the constant-time certificate to avoid periodicity; keep Stage\u20112 out of output.md until this is settled."
