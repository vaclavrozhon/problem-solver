Main fixes: rewrite the δ base case for k_flag=1 using S_τ (Lemma A) so it does not rely on recovering an internal bit; add an endpoint-completion lemma to close the Stage‑1 (⇐) construction for finite directed paths (Lemma B); and rephrase feasible-function verification to quantify only over attainable seam-color sets (Lemma C). An important implementation speedup reduces append from O(β^5) to O(β^4) by precomputing 3D Left3 slices, and further preprocessing of seam-feasibility matrices W_{b⊙c} moves heavy tuple scanning into preprocessing. Sanity checks on equality LCL and 2‑coloring were noted and an actionable checklist of edits and regression tests was supplied. The Verifier returned an \\\"uncertain\\\" verdict.
