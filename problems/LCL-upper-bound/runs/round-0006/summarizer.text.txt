{"summary_md":"Round 0006 audited output.md and supplied small lemmas, implementation optimizations, and sanity checks to close minor gaps in the Stage‑1 machinery. Main fixes: rewrite the δ base case for k_flag=1 using S_τ (Lemma A) so it does not rely on recovering an internal bit; add an endpoint-completion lemma to close the Stage‑1 (⇐) construction for finite directed paths (Lemma B); and rephrase feasible-function verification to quantify only over attainable seam-color sets (Lemma C). An important implementation speedup reduces append from O(β^5) to O(β^4) by precomputing 3D Left3 slices, and further preprocessing of seam-feasibility matrices W_{b⊙c} moves heavy tuple scanning into preprocessing. Sanity checks on equality LCL and 2‑coloring were noted and an actionable checklist of edits and regression tests was supplied. The Verifier returned an \"uncertain\" verdict. Next work: apply the documented edits, run regression tests, and resolve Stage‑2 (partition lemma vs certificate redesign).\n\nCitations: prover-01.out.json (progress_md, Round 0006); output.md; Verifier (verdict).","highlights":["Lemma A (δ base k_flag=1): replace reference to recovered bit b with S_τ := {x : (x,x,x,x) ∈ Ext_τ}; Ext_{δ(τ,a)} then characterized directly via S_τ and A_a.","Lemma B (endpoint completion): end segments between a path endpoint and the nearest separator admit legal completions consistent with the separator seam color, closing a small gap in the Stage‑1 (⇐) proof for finite directed paths.","Lemma C (quantifier minimization): verification of a guessed f can be reformulated to range over attainable seam‑color sets OutR2 and OutL1, eliminating explicit quantification over τ_a,τ_d and simplifying loops.","Append optimization: for k_flag≥4 precompute Left3 (β^3 tensor) to bring append runtime from O(β^5) down to O(β^4) (dense worst case O(β^4 + β^3·Δ)).","Precompute seam‑feasibility matrices W_{b⊙c} (β×β) so Stage‑1 verification reduces to table lookups; heavy scanning of Ext is moved into preprocessing (computed in O(β^4·Δ^2) or faster with sparsity).","Concrete action checklist provided: amend Proposition 9, add Lemma B, add O(β^4) append optimization, optionally integrate Lemma C and W precomputation, and postpone Stage‑2 until partition lemma or certificate redesign is chosen."],"next_questions":["Edit output.md: rewrite Proposition 9 for k_flag=1 using S_τ, insert Lemma B (endpoint completion), and add the O(β^4) append optimization proposition; optionally incorporate Lemma C and note W_{b⊙c} precomputation.","Run regression tests on small alphabets (|Σ_out|≤3): verify O(β^4) append agrees with brute force, check Ext-concatenation associativity, validate W_{b⊙c} against direct Ext scans, and confirm Stage‑1 acceptance/rejection on known instances (equality LCL, 2‑coloring, degenerate A_0=A_1).","Resolve Stage‑2 approach: either provide a constant-radius partition lemma for oriented paths (with parameters and proof) or redesign the constant-time certificate to avoid periodicity; keep Stage‑2 out of output.md until this is settled."]}
