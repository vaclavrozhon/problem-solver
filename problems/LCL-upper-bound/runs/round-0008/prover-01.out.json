  "progress_md": "Round 0008 \u2014 endpoints for Stage-1 on paths, missing base case k=2\u21923, and a clean endpoint-aware feasible-function theorem\n\nSummary of gaps spotted in output.md\n- Missing base case k=2\u21923. The current output.md has Proposition 6 (k=1\u21922) and Proposition 7 (k=3\u21924), but does not state the k=2\u21923 update explicitly. This base rule is used by \u03b4 and is necessary for deterministic enumeration from length 1.\n- Stage-1 equivalence is still marked as \u201cpending endpoint treatment.\u201d The text has a clean Out-set feasible-function definition and the pumping/concatenation tools, but the (\u21d0) direction on paths needs endpoint handling. This is the main blocker to claiming the \u03c9(n) vs o(n) trichotomy on globally oriented paths.\n- Minor duplication: concatenation is stated once for k_flag\u22654 (Lemma 2) and later for all k_flag (Lemma 11). It is harmless, but a single \u201call k_flag\u201d statement would suffice.\n\nProposed additions (self-contained, Ext-level, auditable) to close the Stage-1 endpoint gap\n\nDefinitions (endpoint projections and seam matrices)\n- RightColors(\u03c4) := { y \u2208 \u03a3_out : \u2203 x1,x2,x3 with (x1,x2,x3,y) \u2208 Ext_\u03c4 }.\n- LeftColors(\u03c4) := { x \u2208 \u03a3_out : \u2203 x2,x3,x4 with (x,x2,x3,x4) \u2208 Ext_\u03c4 }.\n- Endpoint seam-compatibility matrices:\n  - V_left[\u03c4][\u03b1] is true iff \u2203 y \u2208 RightColors(\u03c4) with E(y, \u03b1).\n  - V_right[\u03b1][\u03c4] is true iff \u2203 x \u2208 LeftColors(\u03c4) with E(\u03b1, x).\nWhy useful here. These capture exactly the one-sided feasibility needed to glue an endpoint block to its unique adjacent separator by a single E-edge. They can be computed in time 2^{poly(\u03b2)} after Ext tables, and they reduce all endpoint checks to constant-time lookups.\n\nLemma E1 (endpoint equivalences)\n- For any type \u03c4 and any color \u03b1, there exists a legal labeling of a left end-block P of type \u03c4 that matches E at the seam to a separator whose first output is \u03b1 iff V_left[\u03c4][\u03b1] is true.\n- Dually, there exists a legal labeling of a right end-block P of type \u03c4 that matches E at the seam from a separator whose second output is \u03b1 iff V_right[\u03b1][\u03c4] is true.\nSketch proof. The rightmost coordinate of Ext_\u03c4 lists all possible o4; the existence of an o4 with E(o4, \u03b1) is precisely V_left[\u03c4][\u03b1]. For the right end, the leftmost coordinate lists all possible o1; the existence of x with E(\u03b1, x) is V_right[\u03b1][\u03c4]. In both directions, Ext-membership provides the interior completion.\nWhy useful here. This is the missing local criterion to fill one-sided blocks in the Stage-1 construction on finite paths.\n\nEndpoint-aware Stage-1 witness for paths\n- Mid-separator feasible function (as in output.md). f_mid: T_long \u00d7 {0,1}^2 \u00d7 T_long \u2192 \u03a3_out^2 with the Out-set universal check via Ext_{\u03c4_b \u2299 \u03c4_c}.\n- Endpoint witnesses:\n  - g_L: T \u00d7 {0,1}^2 \u2192 \u03a3_out^2 assigns the 2-node output on the unique separator adjacent to the left endpoint; for each (\u03c4_end, s), let g_L(\u03c4_end, s) = (\u03b21, \u03b22).\n  - g_R: {0,1}^2 \u00d7 T \u2192 \u03a3_out^2 assigns the 2-node output on the unique separator adjacent to the right endpoint; for each (s, \u03c4_end), let g_R(s, \u03c4_end) = (\u03b21, \u03b22).\nConstraints for g_L,g_R:\n  - Node/window legality: \u03b2i \u2208 A_{s[i]} (i=1,2) and E(\u03b21, \u03b22).\n  - One-sided seam feasibility: V_left[\u03c4_end][\u03b21] = true for g_L, and V_right[\u03b22][\u03c4_end] = true for g_R.\nWhy useful here. These capture exactly the conditions needed to legally glue an endpoint block to its neighbor separator using only Ext-tables (no global simulation).\n\nTheorem P-S1 (Stage-1 on globally oriented paths)\nLet P be a \u03b2-normalized radius-1 LCL on globally oriented paths. The following are equivalent:\n1) P has deterministic LOCAL complexity o(n) on paths.\n2) There exist witnesses (f_mid, g_L, g_R) satisfying: f_mid is feasible (Out-set form in output.md) and g_L,g_R satisfy the above constraints with V_left,V_right.\nMoreover, the existence of such witnesses is verifiable in nondeterministic time 2^{poly(\u03b2)}.\n\nProof outline and how it fits the current framework\n- (\u21d2) Given an o(n) algorithm A, extract f_mid as in output.md (Lemma 18 style) using pumping and concatenation. For g_L and g_R, place a single separator S next to an arbitrary end block of type \u03c4_end, embed the configuration in a large pumped path to the left/right, simulate A for o(n) rounds, and define g_L(\u03c4_end, s) (resp. g_R) as the 2-node output on S. Local legality of A guarantees the node/window constraints, and seam legality implies the corresponding endpoint matrix entry (Lemma E1). All constructions depend only on Types by pumping; hence well-defined.\n- (\u21d0) Given (f_mid, g_L, g_R), compute in O(log* n) rounds an MIS on the K-th power of the directed path with K := \u2113_pump + 4. As in output.md, label every internal separator with f_mid and fill each middle block via the Ext-witness in Ext_{\u03c4_b \u2299 \u03c4_c}. For the left end block P_end with its unique neighbor separator S, let g_L(\u03c4_end, s) = (\u03b21, \u03b22). By V_left[\u03c4_end][\u03b21], choose (o1,o2,o3,o4) \u2208 Ext_{\u03c4_end} with E(o4, \u03b21) and fill P_end accordingly; similarly the right end via g_R and V_right. All node and edge constraints hold by Ext membership and seam E-tests. Runtime is O(log* n); endpoints add no overhead.\n- NEXPTIME verification. Deterministically enumerate T, T_long, Ext tables, and precompute V_left,V_right and the seam-feasibility matrices W_{b\u2299c} (already in output.md). Nondeterministically guess f_mid, g_L, g_R and verify: (i) node/window constraints for all entries; (ii) the Out-set universal checks for f_mid using W_{b\u2299c}; (iii) one-sided checks for g_L,g_R using V_left,V_right. Total time 2^{poly(\u03b2)}.\nWhy useful here. This removes the \u201cpending endpoint treatment\u201d remark and completes the o(n) vs \u03a9(n) decision for globally oriented paths at the type/Ext level.\n\nExplicit k=2\u21923 base-case to insert\nProposition (Base-case update; k=2\u21923). Let t = (b1, b2), t\u2032 := t\u00b7a. For all (x1, x2, x3, x4) \u2208 \u03a3_out^4,\n(x1,x2,x3,x4) \u2208 Ext_{t\u2032} \u21d4 [ x3 = x2, x1 \u2208 A_{b1}, x2 \u2208 A_{b2}, x4 \u2208 A_a, E(x1,x2), E(x2,x4) ].\nWhy useful here. Needed by \u03b4 to lift k_flag from 2 to 3 and to make the append DP fully constructive from seeds.\n\nComplexity notes (consistent with output.md)\n- Precompute T via \u03b4 in 2^{poly(\u03b2)}; compute Ext_\u03c4 for all \u03c4 and Ext_{\u03c4_b \u2299 \u03c4_c} (for \u03c4_b,\u03c4_c \u2208 T_long) using the O(\u03b2^6) routine; precompute W_{b\u2299c} and V_left,V_right in \u03b2^{O(1)} per pair.\n- Certificate size: f_mid has |T_long|^2\u00b74 entries; g_L has |T|\u00b74, g_R has |T|\u00b74 entries. Verification consists of constant-time table lookups per case; total time 2^{poly(\u03b2)}.\n\nSanity checks (toy instances)\n- Equality LCL (E={(c,c)}, A_0=A_1={c}). RightColors(\u03c4)=LeftColors(\u03c4)={c} for all \u03c4; choose f_mid(\u00b7)=(c,c), g_L=g_R=(c,c). All matrices trivial; accepts.\n- Proper 2-coloring (\u03a3_out={a,b}, E forbids equal). A standard f_mid exists (alternating), and V_left,V_right are always true since RightColors=LeftColors={a,b}. Stage-1 accepts. (Stage-2 will correctly reject constant-time.)\n- Linear-hard case: If for some \u03c4_end, RightColors(\u03c4_end) has no E-neighbor in a color forced as \u03b21 by any g_L, then V_left fails and the verifier rejects, certifying \u03a9(n).\n\nAction items for outputs.md\n- Add the k=2\u21923 base rule explicitly (as above), beside k=1\u21922 and k=3\u21924.\n- Add RightColors/LeftColors and the endpoint matrices V_left,V_right with a short correctness lemma (Lemma E1).\n- Add the endpoint-aware Stage-1 theorem (Theorem P-S1) with the construction/verification outline; reference existing Lemmas 11\u201314 and Prop. 21 for the internal (two-sided) parts.\n- Optional editorial: merge Lemma 2 and Lemma 11 into a single \u201call k_flag\u201d concatenation lemma, or keep both but note that Lemma 11 subsumes Lemma 2.\n\nNotes toward Stage-2 (constant vs log* n)\n- The paper\u2019s (\u2113_width, \u2113_count, \u2113_pattern)-partition (Lemma 22) is already reproduced for cycles and applies to oriented paths with a simpler orientation primitive. Integrating the per-type boundary-interface witness Q_\u03c4 and bridging checks from earlier rounds should now be feasible. I will prepare a path-specialized statement and proof next, using the existing Ext machinery and associativity.\n\nWhy these steps are incremental and testable\n- All additions reduce to precomputable projections or matrices over already-defined Ext tables; no new global gadgets are used.\n- The endpoint matrices enable immediate unit tests: compute V_left,V_right on random tiny instances and compare against brute-force searches over Ext.\n- The endpoint-aware theorem uses the same MIS-based spacing (already standard and cited) and reuses W_{b\u2299c}; only constant-size endpoint lookups are added.\n"
