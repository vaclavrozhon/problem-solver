  "progress_md": "Round 0008 \u2014 Path endpoints for Stage\u20111, Stage\u20112 certificate formalization for oriented paths, and audit items\n\nSummary\n- I propose a complete, endpoint-aware Stage\u20111 characterization for globally oriented paths that is verifiable in NEXPTIME and closes the gap currently marked as \u201cpending endpoint treatment\u201d in output.md. The witness consists of (i) a two-sided feasible function f_mid on long types, plus (ii) one-sided endpoint witnesses g_L and g_R certified via precomputed endpoint seam-compatibility matrices derived from Ext.\n- I also propose a precise Stage\u20112 (O(1) vs \u03a9(log* n)) certificate specialized to globally oriented paths, with a constant-time construction proof that reuses the paper\u2019s (\u2113_width,\u2113_count,\u2113_pattern)-partition framework, now expressed wholly in Ext/type terms. This fills the other major missing piece.\n- I point out several small gaps/cleanups in output.md (notably the missing k=2\u21923 base case and a minor duplication) and list concise steps to integrate the new lemmas and theorems.\n\nAudit of output.md: gaps and cleanups\n- Missing base case k=2\u21923. Proposition 6 (k=1\u21922) and Proposition 7 (k=3\u21924) are present, but the explicit k=2\u21923 update is absent. This is needed to seed \u03b4 transitions from length 2.\n  \u2022 Correct rule to add: for t=(b1,b2), t\u2032=t\u00b7a,\n    (x1,x2,x3,x4)\u2208Ext_{t\u2032} iff [x3=x2, x1\u2208A_{b1}, x2\u2208A_{b2}, x4\u2208A_a, E(x1,x2), E(x2,x4)].\n- Stage\u20111 equivalence on paths is marked \u201cpending endpoint treatment.\u201d Below I supply a self-contained endpoint-aware witness, a verification routine, and an equivalence theorem using only Ext and Types.\n- Redundancy: Lemma 2 (Ext concatenation for k_flag\u22654) and Lemma 11 (for all k_flag) both appear. Lemma 11 subsumes Lemma 2; we can keep both but it is clearer to refer uniformly to Lemma 11.\n- Stage\u20112 (O(1) vs \u03a9(log* n)) is not yet included. I give a precise per-type boundary-interface witness and an O(1) labeling construction for oriented paths, with checks entirely in Ext.\n\nPreliminaries to add (endpoint projections)\n- Define for any type \u03c4:\n  \u2022 RightColors(\u03c4) := { y \u2208 \u03a3_out : \u2203x1,x2,x3 s.t. (x1,x2,x3,y) \u2208 Ext_\u03c4 }.\n  \u2022 LeftColors(\u03c4)  := { x \u2208 \u03a3_out : \u2203x2,x3,y s.t. (x,x2,x3,y) \u2208 Ext_\u03c4 }.\n  These are just projections of Ext_\u03c4; computable in O(\u03b2^4) per \u03c4.\n- Define endpoint seam-compatibility (precompute once):\n  \u2022 V_left[\u03c4][\u03b11] = true iff \u2203y\u2208RightColors(\u03c4) with E(y,\u03b11).\n  \u2022 V_right[\u03b12][\u03c4] = true iff \u2203x\u2208LeftColors(\u03c4) with E(\u03b12,x).\n  These witness that an end block of type \u03c4 can be attached to the first (resp. last) node of the adjacent 2-node separator colored \u03b11 (resp. \u03b12).\n\nStage\u20111 (\u03a9(n) vs o(n)) on globally oriented paths \u2014 endpoint-aware witness and equivalence\nWitness objects to guess and verify\n- Long types: T_long := {\u03c4 : k_flag(\u03c4)\u22654}. Precompute T and split.\n- Mid-separator feasible function f_mid: T_long \u00d7 {0,1}^2 \u00d7 T_long \u2192 \u03a3_out^2.\n  \u2022 Local legality: if f_mid(\u03c4_L, s, \u03c4_R)=(\u03b11,\u03b12), require \u03b1i\u2208A_{s[i]} and E(\u03b11,\u03b12).\n  \u2022 Universal extendibility across two separators: For all \u03c4_b,\u03c4_c\u2208T_long, s1,s2\u2208{0,1}^2 and for all \u03b1_L \u2208 OutR2(\u03c4_b,s1), \u03b1_R \u2208 OutL1(\u03c4_c,s2), require \u2203(o1,o2,o3,o4)\u2208Ext_{\u03c4_b\u2299\u03c4_c} with E(\u03b1_L,o1) and E(o4,\u03b1_R). Here\n    OutR2(\u03c4_b,s):={second(f_mid(\u03c4_a,s,\u03c4_b)): \u03c4_a\u2208T_long},\n    OutL1(\u03c4_c,s):={first(f_mid(\u03c4_c,s,\u03c4_d)): \u03c4_d\u2208T_long}.\n  \u2022 Verification reduction: precompute W_{b\u2299c}[\u03b1_L][\u03b1_R] as in Prop. 21; then check W_{b\u2299c}[\u03b1_L][\u03b1_R]=true for all required \u03b1_L, \u03b1_R.\n- Endpoint witnesses: g_L : T \u00d7 {0,1}^2 \u2192 \u03a3_out^2 and g_R : {0,1}^2 \u00d7 T \u2192 \u03a3_out^2.\n  \u2022 Local legality: if g_L(\u03c4_end,s)=(\u03b21,\u03b22) then \u03b2i\u2208A_{s[i]} and E(\u03b21,\u03b22). Symmetric for g_R.\n  \u2022 One-sided feasibility: V_left[\u03c4_end][\u03b21]=true for g_L, and V_right[\u03b22][\u03c4_end]=true for g_R.\n\nTheorem S1-path (equivalence; oriented paths).\nAn r=1, \u03b2-normalized LCL on globally oriented paths has deterministic complexity o(n) iff there exist witnesses (f_mid, g_L, g_R) satisfying the above checks. Moreover, existence is verifiable in nondeterministic time 2^{poly(\u03b2)}.\nSketch proof (\u21d2): Given an o(n)-round algorithm A, define f_mid exactly as in the cycle case by pumping the two long contexts on either side of a 2-node separator; feasibility uses Ext_{\u03c4_b\u2299\u03c4_c} (Lemma 11) and pumping (Lemmas 13\u201314). Define g_L(\u03c4_end,s), g_R(s,\u03c4_end) by simulating A on a path that consists of a long pumped left (resp. right) context, then the endpoint block of type \u03c4_end, then a 2-node separator S with input s, then a long pumped right (resp. left) context; pick IDs so that A\u2019s runtime halo is well inside the pumped parts. Local legality is by correctness of A; one-sided feasibility follows because the seam edge between the endpoint block and S is satisfied in the simulation, hence V_left/V_right holds by projection to Ext.\nSketch proof (\u21d0): From (f_mid, g_L, g_R), construct in O(log* n) a labeling as follows. In O(log* n) rounds, compute an MIS on the K-th power of the oriented path (K:=\u2113_pump+4); separators are the selected MIS nodes augmented to 2-node blocks with inputs s, spaced in [K,2K]. For each interior pair of separators (S1, S2) with adjacent long types \u03c4_b, \u03c4_c on their sides, color S1 and S2 by f_mid, and complete the middle using the witness in Ext_{\u03c4_b\u2299\u03c4_c}. For endpoint segments, color the unique separator S by g_L or g_R and complete the adjoining block using V_left or V_right and Ext of the endpoint type. All checks and fillings are local and constant-radius; runtime O(log* n) comes from MIS.\nNEXPTIME verification: Deterministically compute T, T_long, Ext and W_{b\u2299c}, V_left, V_right in 2^{poly(\u03b2)} time. Nondeterministically guess f_mid, g_L, g_R and verify the finite set of constraints via table lookups; total time 2^{poly(\u03b2)}.\n\nStage\u20112 (O(1) vs \u03a9(log* n)) on globally oriented paths \u2014 per-type boundary interface\nWitness per long type \u03c4\u2208T_long: Q_\u03c4=(L1_\u03c4,L2_\u03c4,R2_\u03c4,R1_\u03c4)\u2208Ext_\u03c4.\nChecks\n- Per-type tiling:\n  \u2022 E(L1_\u03c4,L2_\u03c4), E(R2_\u03c4,R1_\u03c4) (redundant but explicit), and wrap E(R1_\u03c4,L1_\u03c4).\n- Universal bridging across any middle type \u03c4_S (short or long):\n  \u2022 For all \u03c4_left, \u03c4_S, \u03c4_right with \u03c4_left,\u03c4_right\u2208T_long: \u2203(o1,o2,o3,o4)\u2208Ext_{\u03c4_S} with E(R1_{\u03c4_left},o1) and E(o4,L1_{\u03c4_right}). For S empty, this reduces to E(R1_{\u03c4_left},L1_{\u03c4_right}).\nTheorem S2-path (constant-time construction).\nIf {Q_\u03c4} satisfy the above, there is an O(1)-round deterministic algorithm on oriented paths.\nSketch construction: In O(1) rounds compute an (\u2113_width,\u2113_count,\u2113_pattern)-partition (as in the paper\u2019s Lemma 22; here orientation is globally given). Choose parameters \u2113_width=\u2113_pattern=\u2113_pump and \u2113_count=2\u2113_pump+2. Long paths are periodic with primitive period length \u2264\u2113_pump, repeated \u2265\u2113_count. Each long path P has a long type \u03c4; tile P by repeats of \u03c4 using E(R1_\u03c4,L1_\u03c4); interior legality holds since Q_\u03c4\u2208Ext_\u03c4. Each short/irregular separator S (any \u03c4_S) is filled using its Ext witness to match the boundary colors of adjacent long blocks (bridging condition). Endpoints need no special treatment beyond bridging to the nearest long block. All decisions are constant-radius.\nNEXPTIME verification: Guess {Q_\u03c4} over T_long; verify tiling and bridging universally with Ext lookups; total time 2^{poly(\u03b2)}.\n\nComplexity refinements and preprocessing\n- Append optimization (already Proposition 19): O(\u03b2^4) per append after Left3 slices.\n- Concatenation optimization (Proposition 5): O(\u03b2^6) per pair via Left/Right 3D slices.\n- Seam feasibility matrices W_{b\u2299c} (Proposition 21): speed up Stage\u20111 verification.\n- Endpoint matrices V_left, V_right: O(|T|\u00b7\u03b2\u00b7\u0394) preprocessing; used by g_L/g_R verification.\n\nSanity checks on examples\n- Equality LCL: choose c\u2208A_0\u2229A_1 with E(c,c); f_mid constant (c,c); g_L, g_R constant (c,c); any Q_\u03c4=(c,c,c,c); both stages accept \u21d2 O(1).\n- Proper 2-coloring: Stage\u20111 witnesses exist (\u0398(log* n)); Stage\u20112 fails due to wrap E(R1_\u03c4,L1_\u03c4) and universal bridging impossibility with a period\u20111 interface; classification \u0398(log* n).\n- Linear case: if no feasible (f_mid,g_L,g_R) exists, Stage\u20111 rejects \u21d2 \u03a9(n).\n\nActionable insertions for output.md\n1) Add Proposition (Base-case update; k=2\u21923) exactly as stated in the audit.\n2) Add definitions of RightColors, LeftColors, V_left, V_right, and a short proposition on their computation/complexity.\n3) Add the endpoint-aware Stage\u20111 theorem S1-path: statement, witness definitions (f_mid, g_L, g_R), quantifier-minimized verification using W_{b\u2299c}, and both directions of the equivalence (with brief, oriented-path-specific proofs relying on Lemmas 11, 13\u201314).\n4) Add Stage\u20112 theorem S2-path: the per-type boundary interface witness Q_\u03c4, universal checks, and the O(1) labeling construction using the (\u2113_width,\u2113_count,\u2113_pattern)-partition on oriented paths (cite the paper\u2019s lemma if not reproved in full; parameters explicit).\n5) Note that Lemma 11 subsumes Lemma 2 and refer to Lemma 11 uniformly for concatenation; optionally keep Lemma 2 as a corollary for readability.\n\nWhy these fill the gaps\n- Stage\u20111 now covers finite paths with endpoints rigorously, removing the caveat. All conditions are expressed with Ext plus precomputed matrices, so the verification remains single-exponential. The construction uses only standard Kth\u2011power MIS.\n- Stage\u20112 shifts entirely to per-type interfaces and Ext bridging, matching the paper\u2019s constant-time regime but specialized to globally oriented paths. The verification is again single-exponential; the algorithm is explicit and constant\u2011round.\n\nNext steps\n- Integrate the new statements into output.md with concise proofs. Keep the MIS step description and (\u2113_width,\u2113_count,\u2113_pattern)-partition paraphrased from the paper but specialized to oriented paths.\n- Add a small regression suite for \u03b2\u2208{2,3}: (i) verify k=2\u21923 update; (ii) validate V_left/V_right vs direct Ext; (iii) test W_{b\u2299c} correctness; (iv) confirm Stage\u20111 acceptance on equality LCL, Stage\u20112 rejection on 2\u2011coloring.\n"
