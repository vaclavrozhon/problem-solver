  "summary_md": "Round 0008: Two provers independently supply the missing endpoint handling and a Stage\u20112 certificate specialization for globally oriented paths. They identify and give the explicit k=2\u21923 base-case needed for the \u03b4 DP seed; introduce RightColors/LeftColors and endpoint seam matrices V_left and V_right (Lemma E1) computed from Ext tables to reduce endpoint feasibility to constant-time lookups; and define endpoint witnesses g_L and g_R to accompany the mid-separator feasible function f_mid. Theorem P\u2011S1 (aka S1\u2011path) states: an r=1, \u03b2\u2011normalized LCL has deterministic complexity o(n) on oriented paths iff (f_mid,g_L,g_R) satisfying Ext/W_{b\u2299c}/V_left/V_right checks exist \u2014 existence verifiable in nondeterministic time 2^{poly(\u03b2)}. They also propose a Stage\u20112 per-type boundary interface Q_\u03c4 giving an O(1) construction when tiling/bridging conditions hold, with similar NEXPTIME verification. Action items: insert k=2\u21923, endpoint projections/matrices and Lemma E1, plus the endpoint-aware Stage\u20111 and Stage\u20112 statements into output.md.

    "Missing base case k=2\u21923 explicitly provided; necessary for \u03b4 to lift k_flag from 2\u21923 and for constructive DP seeding.",

    "Integrate the proposed items into output.md: add the k=2\u21923 proposition, Right/LeftColors, V_left/V_right with Lemma E1, and the endpoint\u2011aware Stage\u20111 theorem (P\u2011S1/S1\u2011path) with proof sketches and references to Lemmas 11,13\u201314 and Prop.21.",
    "Implement regression tests (\u03b2\u2208{2,3}): (i) validate the k=2\u21923 rule vs brute force Ext, (ii) check V_left/V_right entries against exhaustive Ext search, (iii) validate W_{b\u2299c}, and (iv) confirm Stage\u20111 acceptance on equality LCL and Stage\u20112 rejection on 2\u2011coloring.",
    "Decide editorial stance: merge Lemma 2 into Lemma 11 (they overlap) or keep both and add a remark that Lemma 11 subsumes Lemma 2; then produce the final concise insertion into output.md for auditing."
