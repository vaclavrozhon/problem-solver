They identify and give the explicit k=2→3 base-case needed for the δ DP seed; introduce RightColors/LeftColors and endpoint seam matrices V_left and V_right (Lemma E1) computed from Ext tables to reduce endpoint feasibility to constant-time lookups; and define endpoint witnesses g_L and g_R to accompany the mid-separator feasible function f_mid. Theorem P‑S1 (aka S1‑path) states: an r=1, β‑normalized LCL has deterministic complexity o(n) on oriented paths iff (f_mid,g_L,g_R) satisfying Ext/W_{b⊙c}/V_left/V_right checks exist — existence verifiable in nondeterministic time 2^{poly(β)}.
