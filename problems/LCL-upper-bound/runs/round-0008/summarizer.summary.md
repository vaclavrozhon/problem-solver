Round 0008: Two provers independently supply the missing endpoint handling and a Stage‑2 certificate specialization for globally oriented paths. They identify and give the explicit k=2→3 base-case needed for the δ DP seed; introduce RightColors/LeftColors and endpoint seam matrices V_left and V_right (Lemma E1) computed from Ext tables to reduce endpoint feasibility to constant-time lookups; and define endpoint witnesses g_L and g_R to accompany the mid-separator feasible function f_mid. Theorem P‑S1 (aka S1‑path) states: an r=1, β‑normalized LCL has deterministic complexity o(n) on oriented paths iff (f_mid,g_L,g_R) satisfying Ext/W_{b⊙c}/V_left/V_right checks exist — existence verifiable in nondeterministic time 2^{poly(β)}. They also propose a Stage‑2 per-type boundary interface Q_τ giving an O(1) construction when tiling/bridging conditions hold, with similar NEXPTIME verification. Action items: insert k=2→3, endpoint projections/matrices and Lemma E1, plus the endpoint-aware Stage‑1 and Stage‑2 statements into output.md. (Sources: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json)
