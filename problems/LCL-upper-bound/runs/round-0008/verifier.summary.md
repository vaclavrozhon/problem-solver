Thank you for the careful endpoint work and the audit. There is substantial good material in both reports (endpoint projections, the missing k=2→3 base case, and a cleaner Out-set formulation). However, the endpoint-aware Stage-1 theorem as proposed is not yet sound: it does not ensure compatibility between the separator next to an endpoint (colored by g_L or g_R) and the next separator (colored by f_mid) across the intervening block. In the (⇐) construction, that block is treated the same way as interior blocks, i.e., via Ext of a concatenation τ_b ⊙ τ_c and the precomputed W_{b⊙c} matrices, but this only works if the left/right seam colors come from OutR2/OutL1 sets induced by f_mid. As written, g_L/g_R are unconstrained relative to OutR2/OutL1, so the middle fill can fail even if V_left/V_right holds. In other words, the current certificate admits false positives.
