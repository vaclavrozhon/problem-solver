{"feedback_md":"Thank you for the careful endpoint work and the audit. There is substantial good material in both reports (endpoint projections, the missing k=2→3 base case, and a cleaner Out-set formulation). However, the endpoint-aware Stage-1 theorem as proposed is not yet sound: it does not ensure compatibility between the separator next to an endpoint (colored by g_L or g_R) and the next separator (colored by f_mid) across the intervening block. In the (⇐) construction, that block is treated the same way as interior blocks, i.e., via Ext of a concatenation τ_b ⊙ τ_c and the precomputed W_{b⊙c} matrices, but this only works if the left/right seam colors come from OutR2/OutL1 sets induced by f_mid. As written, g_L/g_R are unconstrained relative to OutR2/OutL1, so the middle fill can fail even if V_left/V_right holds. In other words, the current certificate admits false positives.\n\nMinimal obstruction template. Fix a long type τ_b whose OutR2(τ_b,s)={α} and assume W_{b⊙c}[α][·] admits fills for all α_R from OutL1(τ_c,·). If g_L(·,·) outputs a right color β≠α at the endpoint-adjacent separator, the proposed checks (node legality + V_left) pass but there need not exist any quadruple in Ext_{τ_b⊙τ_c} with E(β,o1), so the fill between the first two separators can fail. The current certificate does not prevent this situation.\n\nConcrete fix. Augment the endpoint witnesses so that their “open” seam color is aligned with the interior Out-sets:\n- Use g_L: T × {0,1}^2 × T_long → Σ_out^2. Require: (i) node/window legality and E(β1,β2); (ii) V_left[τ_end][β1]; and crucially (iii) β2 ∈ OutR2(τ_b,s) for the adjacent long type τ_b on the right. Symmetrically, use g_R: T_long × {0,1}^2 × T → Σ_out^2 with (i) node/window; (ii) V_right[β2][τ_end]; (iii) β1 ∈ OutL1(τ_c,s) for the adjacent long type τ_c on the left. With this, the block between the endpoint separator and the next separator can be filled via the same W_{b⊙c} check used for interior blocks.\n\n- (⇒) Extracting g_L/g_R with the extra argument is straightforward by embedding the endpoint configuration into pumped long contexts of prescribed types τ_b or τ_c and reading the algorithm’s outputs; pumping ensures well-definedness.\n- (⇐) The MIS-based O(log* n) construction now works verbatim: label interior separators by f_mid, endpoint-adjacent separators by g_L/g_R, fill end blocks using V_left/V_right and the intervening endpoint–interior block via W_{b⊙c} with α_L=second(g_L) or α_R=first(g_R) which, by construction, lie in OutR2/OutL1.\n\nWhat we can safely add now. The k=2→3 base case is correct and should be inserted (it is also consistent with our indexing (L1,L2,R2,R1)). The endpoint projections RightColors/LeftColors and the seam matrices V_left/V_right are correct and useful; add them with a short equivalence lemma (existence of a legal end-block completion iff the respective matrix bit is true). These are local, Ext-based facts and do not depend on the unresolved global issue above.\n\nOn Stage-2. The proposed S2-path certificate is promising, but the constant-time partition/tiling step is not yet self-contained here; we should keep S2 in notes until a path-specialized partition lemma with explicit parameters and proof is recorded.\n\nNext steps for provers:\n1) Formalize the corrected Stage-1 path certificate with g_L(τ_end,s,τ_b) and g_R(τ_b,s,τ_end), include the OutR2/OutL1 membership constraints, and write the full (⇒) and (⇐) proofs.\n2) Integrate this into the existing Out-set/W_{b⊙c} machinery; verify that the NEXPTIME check remains table-lookups only.\n3) Add unit tests: confirm that without the Out-set constraint, false positives can occur; with the constraint, the first interior block is always fillable.\n4) For Stage-2, draft a self-contained oriented-path partition lemma (parameters ℓ_width, ℓ_count, ℓ_pattern) or an alternative constant-round construction that avoids external citations.\n5) Editorial: optionally note that Lemma 11 subsumes Lemma 2 and standardize references.\n","new_notes_md":"Endpoint seam projections and matrices (r=1, oriented paths)\n\n- For any type τ, define:\n  RightColors(τ) := { y ∈ Σ_out : ∃ x1,x2,x3 with (x1,x2,x3,y) ∈ Ext_τ }.\n  LeftColors(τ)  := { x ∈ Σ_out : ∃ x2,x3,y with (x,x2,x3,y) ∈ Ext_τ }.\n  These are just the projections of Ext_τ to coordinates R1 and L1.\n\n- Define endpoint seam-compatibility matrices from Ext alone:\n  V_left[τ][α]  := (∃ y ∈ RightColors(τ) with E(y, α)).\n  V_right[α][τ] := (∃ x ∈ LeftColors(τ) with E(α, x)).\n\nLemma E1 (endpoint feasibility via Ext).

If (x1,x2,x3,y)∈Ext_τ and E(y,α), then the end-block interior is witnessed by Ext_τ and the seam edge by E(y,α). Conversely, any legal instance provides such y. The right case is symmetric.\n\nEndpoint gap in Stage-1 (diagnosis and fix). Our current Stage-1 construction labels interior separators using a feasible f and fills the block between them via Ext_{τ_b ⊙ τ_c} using W_{b⊙c}. For paths, the first/last interior block is bounded on one side by an endpoint-adjacent separator. If that separator is colored by an independent g_L/g_R, the right (resp. left) seam color entering the first (resp. last) interior block may lie outside the OutR2/OutL1 sets induced by f. Then the pre-verified W_{b⊙c} guarantees do not apply, and the fill of that block can fail, even if V_left/V_right holds. Hence additional coupling is required.\n\nCorrected Stage-1 certificate for paths (proposal). Keep T_long and f as in the Out-set formulation. Replace the 2-argument endpoint maps by 3-argument ones that are aligned with the Out-sets of the adjacent long type:\n- g_L: T × {0,1}^2 × T_long → Σ_out^2. For g_L(τ_end, s, τ_b)=(β1,β2) require:\n  (i) node/window legality at the separator: βi ∈ A_{s[i]} and E(β1,β2);\n  (ii) one-sided feasibility toward the endpoint: V_left[τ_end][β1]=true;\n  (iii) alignment with interior Out-set: β2 ∈ OutR2(τ_b, s).\n- g_R: T_long × {0,1}^2 × T → Σ_out^2. For g_R(τ_c, s, τ_end)=(β1,β2) require:\n  (i) node/window legality and E(β1,β2);\n  (ii) one-sided feasibility toward the endpoint: V_right[β2][τ_end]=true;\n  (iii) alignment with interior Out-set: β1 ∈ OutL1(τ_c, s).\n\nWith these constraints, the MIS-based O(log* n) construction proceeds as before:\n- Label every interior separator by f; label the endpoint-adjacent separators using g_L/g_R (using the computed adjacent long types τ_b, τ_c on their interior sides). Fill end-blocks using Lemma E1.\n- For the blocks between an endpoint-adjacent separator and its nearest interior separator, use the same W_{b⊙c} check as for interior blocks, with α_L := second(g_L(…)) or α_R := first(g_R(…)). By (iii), α_L ∈ OutR2(τ_b,·) and α_R ∈ OutL1(τ_c,·), so the precomputed W_{b⊙c} guarantees existence of a witness in Ext_{τ_b ⊙ τ_c}.\n\nNecessity (⇒) sketch under the corrected certificate. Given an o(n)-round algorithm A:\n- Extract f from A as in the cycle case (pumping + concatenation).\n- For each (τ_end, s, τ_b), build a path consisting of a long pumped block of type τ_b to the right, the separator with input s, and an endpoint block of type τ_end on the left (plus pumped padding as needed outside the radius of A). Let g_L(τ_end,s,τ_b) be A’s output on the separator. Pumping ensures well-definedness and (iii). The V_left constraint follows because the seam into the endpoint segment is satisfied by A. Symmetrically define g_R.\n\nVerification remains in 2^{poly(β)}: T, T_long, Ext, W_{b⊙c}, V_left, V_right, OutR2/OutL1 are all precomputable. The guessed tables f, g_L, g_R are checked entrywise.\n\nAction items.\n- Integrate Lemma E1 and the V_left/V_right definitions into outputs.\n- Replace the current endpoint witness proposal by the 3-argument version and update both directions of the Stage-1 path theorem accordingly.\n- Keep Stage-2 items in notes until a self-contained partition lemma for oriented paths is written.\n","new_notes_append":"True","new_outputs_md":"Proposition 6B (Base-case update; k=2→3).\nLet t=(b1,b2) be a length-2 input and t′:=t·a the length-3 input obtained by appending a∈{0,1}.

Any legal labeling on three nodes has boundary (o1,o2,o2,o3), with o1∈A_{b1}, o2∈A_{b2}, o3∈A_a and E(o1,o2), E(o2,o3). Conversely, any tuple satisfying these constraints is realized by such a labeling. □\n\nDefinitions (endpoint projections and seam matrices).\nFor any type τ, define the projections of Ext_τ to the endpoint coordinates:\n- RightColors(τ) := { y ∈ Σ_out : ∃ x1,x2,x3 with (x1,x2,x3,y) ∈ Ext_τ }.\n- LeftColors(τ)  := { x ∈ Σ_out : ∃ x2,x3,y with (x,x2,x3,y) ∈ Ext_τ }.\nDefine the endpoint seam-compatibility matrices by\n- V_left[τ][α]  := true ⇔ ∃ y ∈ RightColors(τ) with E(y, α), and\n- V_right[α][τ] := true ⇔ ∃ x ∈ LeftColors(τ) with E(α, x).\n\nLemma E1 (endpoint feasibility via Ext).\nLet τ be any type and α ∈ Σ_out.\n(i) There exists a legal labeling of a left end-block of type τ together with an adjacent separator whose first output is α if and only if V_left[τ][α] is true.\n(ii) There exists a legal labeling of a right end-block of type τ together with an adjacent separator whose second output is α if and only if V_right[α][τ] is true.\nProof. (i) If V_left[τ][α] holds, pick y ∈ RightColors(τ) with E(y,α) and any (x1,x2,x3,y)∈Ext_τ; Ext-membership provides the interior, and E(y,α) the seam. Conversely, any legal instance gives y as the last output on the end block, whence (x1,x2,x3,y)∈Ext_τ and E(y,α). (ii) is symmetric. □\n\nRemark (on endpoints and Stage-1 for paths).\nThe matrices V_left and V_right give necessary and sufficient local conditions to glue an endpoint block to its unique adjacent separator. In the full o(n) vs Ω(n) classification on oriented paths, one must also ensure that the separator next to an endpoint is compatible with the nearest interior separator across the intervening block. This requires coupling the endpoint separator’s “open” seam color with the Out-sets produced by the feasible function on interior separators; see notes for a corrected certificate and construction. The o(n)⇔feasible-f equivalence remains pending this endpoint–interior bridging step.\n","new_outputs_append":"True","verdict":"partial success"}
