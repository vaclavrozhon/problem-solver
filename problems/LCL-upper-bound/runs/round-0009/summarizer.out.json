  "summary_md": "Round 0009 fixes the Stage\u20111 certificate for r=1 LCLs on globally oriented paths by coupling endpoint witnesses to interior Out-sets. The main change: g_L: T\u00d7{0,1}^2\u00d7T_long\u2192\u03a3_out^2 and g_R: T_long\u00d7{0,1}^2\u00d7T\u2192\u03a3_out^2, with three checks \u2014 node legality, endpoint seam feasibility (V_left/V_right), and alignment of the interior-directed seam with OutR2/OutL1 from f_mid. f_mid remains the interior separator map (Out-set form) and is verified universally via W_{b\u2299c}. Theorem S1-path: an r=1, \u03b2-normalized LCL on oriented paths has deterministic complexity o(n) iff such (f_mid,g_L,g_R) exist; existence is verifiable nondeterministically in 2^{poly(\u03b2)} time. Proof sketches: (\u21d2) extract witnesses by pumping and simulating an o(n)-algorithm; (\u21d0) build an O(log* n) LOCAL algorithm using an MIS on the Kth power, precomputed Ext and W tables, and endpoint fills via V_left/V_right. Prop.19 lowers append costs to O(\u03b2^4) in preprocessing. A minimal counterexample shows the alignment clause is necessary. (Citations: prover-02.out.json, prover-01.out.json).",
  "highlights": [
    "Endpoint-coupled Stage\u20111 certificate established: g_L/g_R now take an adjacent long-type argument and must align the interior-directed seam with OutR2/OutL1 produced by f_mid.",
    "Theorem S1-path: equivalence between o(n)-round solvability and existence of (f_mid,g_L,g_R); verification in nondet 2^{poly(\u03b2)} time.",
    "Concrete O(log* n) construction: place separators by MIS on K=\u2113_pump+4, label interior separators by f_mid, fill interior via W_{b\u2299c} + Ext witnesses, fill endpoints via V_left/V_right.",
    "Preprocessing/verification plan: deterministically compute T, T_long, Ext_\u03c4, Ext_{\u03c4_b\u2299\u03c4_c}, W, V; Prop.19 reduces long-appends to O(\u03b2^4); total nondet verification remains 2^{poly(\u03b2)}.",
    "Minimal obstruction/counterexample: uncoupled endpoints can choose seam colors allowed by V_left/V_right but not in OutR2, making the first interior block unfillable \u2014 motivates alignment requirement.",
    "Implementation refinements: precompute OutR2/OutL1 bitsets, L_allow/R_allow, incremental RightColors via Left3_\u03c4; regression tests planned (misaligned case, equality LCL, 2-coloring)."

  "next_questions": [
    "Integrate Theorem S1-path, full (\u21d2)/(\u21d0) proofs, and the endpoint\u2013interior bridging lemma into output.md; clean up numbering (merge Lemma 2 into Lemma 11; remove duplicate Proposition 6s).",
    "Tighten preprocessing complexity notes in output.md by citing Prop.19 (O(\u03b2^4) per long-append) and update Prop.9 accordingly.",
    "Port Stage\u20112 (\u2113_width,\u2113_count,\u2113_pattern) partitioning to oriented paths, prepare unit tests (including the misalignment counterexample), and finalize the per-type boundary interface certificate Q_\u03c4."
