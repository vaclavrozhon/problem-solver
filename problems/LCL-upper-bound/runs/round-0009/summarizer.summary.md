Round 0009 fixes the Stage‑1 certificate for r=1 LCLs on globally oriented paths by coupling endpoint witnesses to interior Out-sets. The main change: g_L: T×{0,1}^2×T_long→Σ_out^2 and g_R: T_long×{0,1}^2×T→Σ_out^2, with three checks — node legality, endpoint seam feasibility (V_left/V_right), and alignment of the interior-directed seam with OutR2/OutL1 from f_mid. f_mid remains the interior separator map (Out-set form) and is verified universally via W_{b⊙c}. Theorem S1-path: an r=1, β-normalized LCL on oriented paths has deterministic complexity o(n) iff such (f_mid,g_L,g_R) exist; existence is verifiable nondeterministically in 2^{poly(β)} time. Proof sketches: (⇒) extract witnesses by pumping and simulating an o(n)-algorithm; (⇐) build an O(log* n) LOCAL algorithm using an MIS on the Kth power, precomputed Ext and W tables, and endpoint fills via V_left/V_right. Prop.19 lowers append costs to O(β^4) in preprocessing. A minimal counterexample shows the alignment clause is necessary. (Citations: prover-02.out.json, prover-01.out.json).
