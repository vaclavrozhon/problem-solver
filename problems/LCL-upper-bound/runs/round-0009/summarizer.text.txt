  "summary_md": "Round 0009 fixes the Stage‑1 certificate for r=1 LCLs on globally oriented paths by coupling endpoint witnesses to interior Out-sets. The main change: g_L: T×{0,1}^2×T_long→Σ_out^2 and g_R: T_long×{0,1}^2×T→Σ_out^2, with three checks — node legality, endpoint seam feasibility (V_left/V_right), and alignment of the interior-directed seam with OutR2/OutL1 from f_mid. f_mid remains the interior separator map (Out-set form) and is verified universally via W_{b⊙c}. Theorem S1-path: an r=1, β-normalized LCL on oriented paths has deterministic complexity o(n) iff such (f_mid,g_L,g_R) exist; existence is verifiable nondeterministically in 2^{poly(β)} time. Proof sketches: (⇒) extract witnesses by pumping and simulating an o(n)-algorithm; (⇐) build an O(log* n) LOCAL algorithm using an MIS on the Kth power, precomputed Ext and W tables, and endpoint fills via V_left/V_right. Prop.19 lowers append costs to O(β^4) in preprocessing. A minimal counterexample shows the alignment clause is necessary. (Citations: prover-02.out.json, prover-01.out.json).",

    "Endpoint-coupled Stage‑1 certificate established: g_L/g_R now take an adjacent long-type argument and must align the interior-directed seam with OutR2/OutL1 produced by f_mid.",

    "Concrete O(log* n) construction: place separators by MIS on K=ℓ_pump+4, label interior separators by f_mid, fill interior via W_{b⊙c} + Ext witnesses, fill endpoints via V_left/V_right.",
    "Preprocessing/verification plan: deterministically compute T, T_long, Ext_τ, Ext_{τ_b⊙τ_c}, W, V; Prop.19 reduces long-appends to O(β^4); total nondet verification remains 2^{poly(β)}.",
    "Minimal obstruction/counterexample: uncoupled endpoints can choose seam colors allowed by V_left/V_right but not in OutR2, making the first interior block unfillable — motivates alignment requirement.",
    "Implementation refinements: precompute OutR2/OutL1 bitsets, L_allow/R_allow, incremental RightColors via Left3_τ; regression tests planned (misaligned case, equality LCL, 2-coloring)."
