Both reports converge on the same core fix: Stage‑1 for oriented paths must couple the endpoint‑adjacent separator to the interior feasible function via Out‑sets. This resolves the previously identified flaw in output.md (endpoint treatment pending). The proposed certificate (f_mid for interior separators and g_L, g_R for the two endpoint‑adjacent separators, each taking as a third argument the adjacent long type) is correct in spirit and aligns with the Ext/W machinery we have already built. In particular:
