This is now inconsistent. Suggested fix: remove or rewrite the earlier remark to forward\u2011reference Theorem S1\u2011path.\n- Numbering collisions and duplication:\n  \u2022 Proposition 6, 6A, 6B all exist; 6 and 6B both are base cases (k=1\u21922 and k=2\u21923) and 6A is another base case (k_flag=1 variant). Consider renumbering to 6 (k=1\u21922), 7 (k=2\u21923), 8 (k=3\u21924), or add clear \u201c(Base cases)\u201d headers to avoid confusion.\n  \u2022 Concatenation appears as Lemma 2 (k_flag\u22654) and Lemma 11 (all k_flag). Lemma 11 strictly subsumes Lemma 2; a short note stating \u201cLemma 11 subsumes Lemma 2\u201d would prevent confusion.\n- Transition\u2011cost mismatch: Proposition 9 still states \u201cEach transition costs O(\u03b2^5) in the k_flag\u22654 regime,\u201d while a later \u201cCorrection to Proposition 9\u201d paragraph records the improved O(\u03b2^4) bound (via Proposition 19). These must be aligned; keep the O(\u03b2^4) bound in the definitive statement of Proposition 9.\n- Small\u2011n fallback in Theorem S1\u2011path (\u21d0): It says \u201c0 or 1 separators handled by brute\u2011force completion using Ext tables in constant radius.\u201d This is plausible, but a one\u2011line lemma would clarify that any path of length < K can be labeled (or rejected) by a constant\u2011time rule derived from Ext (finite lookup radius K). This would parallel Lemma E2\u2019s style, ensuring no gap at tiny n.\n- Orientation/convention reminder: Theorem S1\u2011path relies on the global convention (L1,L2,R2,R1); all seam references are consistent with earlier definitions. No action, but a short \u201cIndexing reminder\u201d near Definition of OutR2/OutL1 would help readers.\n\nEndpoint coupling in Stage\u20111 \u2014 sanity check on the new content\n- The strengthened endpoint witnesses g_L(\u03c4_end,s,\u03c4_b), g_R(\u03c4_c,s,\u03c4_end), with (iii) \u03b22\u2208OutR2(\u03c4_b,s), \u03b21\u2208OutL1(\u03c4_c,s), are now integrated and correctly cover the first/last interior block via W_{b\u2299c}. This closes the earlier gap.\n- Preprocessing coverage is complete: T and T_long (Prop. 9), Ext (Lemmas 1, 11), W (Prop. 21), V_left/V_right (Lemma E1), and OutR2/OutL1 are all defined. The NEXPTIME verification clause is sound.\n\nStage\u20112 on globally oriented paths (O(1) vs \u0398(log* n)) \u2014 proposed path\u2011specific certificate and theorem\nRationale. To complete the trichotomy with a single\u2011exponential (in \u03b2) nondeterministic verifier, it is convenient to mirror the paper\u2019s Section 4.4 feasible\u2011function framework, specialized to oriented paths. This avoids having to synthesize interior outputs from bare boundary quadruples and leverages the (\u2113_width,\u2113_count,\u2113_pattern) partition (Section 4.3 in the paper) in O(1) rounds.\n\nDefinitions (path specialization; reusing the paper\u2019s Gw,z and Gw1,w2,S)\n- Fix r=1 and \u2113_pump=|T| from Prop. 9. For any 1\u2264|w|\u2264\u2113_pump and z\u22650, Gw,z is the path wr \u00b7 wz \u00b7 wr with complete output labeling f0(w)^{z+2r} (here f0 is a Stage\u20112 function; see below). Mid(Gw,z): the central wz.\n- For any w1,w2 with 1\u2264|wi|\u2264\u2113_pump and any S (possibly empty), Gw1,w2,S is the path w1^{\u2113_pump+2r} \u00b7 S \u00b7 w2^{\u2113_pump+2r} with a partial labeling that fixes the first 2r|w1| outputs to f0(w1)^{2r} and the last 2r|w2| outputs to f0(w2)^{2r}. Mid(Gw1,w2,S): w1^{\u2113_pump+r} \u00b7 S \u00b7 w2^{\u2113_pump+r}.\n- Stage\u20112 feasible function for paths. A map f0: {w \u2208 \u03a3_in^k : 1\u2264k\u2264\u2113_pump} \u2192 \u03a3_out^k is path\u2011feasible if:\n  (F1) For each w, the complete labeling f0(w) is locally legal, and for Gw,1 the labeling is locally consistent on Mid(Gw,1). (Equivalently, Gw,z is locally consistent on its mid for all z\u22651.)\n  (F2) For each Gw1,w2,S, there exists a completion L\u22c4 that is locally consistent on Mid(Gw1,w2,S).\nRemark. This is the path analogue of the cycle notion used in the attached paper (Lemmas 23\u201327), with the same quantitative parameters (\u2113_pump) and \u201cmid\u2011block extendibility\u201d semantics; the only change is that we do not wrap ends.\n\nTheorem S2\u2011path (O(1) vs \u0398(log* n) on oriented paths; verifiable in NEXPTIME)\n- Statement. An r=1 \u03b2\u2011normalized LCL on globally oriented paths has deterministic LOCAL complexity O(1) iff there exists a path\u2011feasible function f0. Otherwise, if Theorem S1\u2011path holds but no f0 exists, the complexity is \u0398(log* n).\n- (\u21d2) Given an O(1)\u2011round algorithm A, extract f0 as in the paper\u2019s Lemma 24: for each 1\u2264|w|\u2264\u2113_pump, simulate A on wi \u00b7 w^{2r+1} \u00b7 wi with distinct IDs confined to a constant halo; define f0(w) as A\u2019s outputs on w (one period). Local legality implies (F1), and by the same mid\u2011block simulation trick, (F2) holds for all Gw1,w2,S (replace the two long contexts by pumped canonical representatives so that the constant runtime halos are disjoint). This is the path version of Lemmas 24\u201325.\n- (\u21d0) Given f0, compute in O(1) rounds an (\u2113_width,\u2113_count,\u2113_pattern)\u2011partition tailored to oriented paths (paper\u2019s Lemma 22; orientation is given, so Lemma 19\u2019s orientation step is unnecessary): short paths of length \u22642\u2113_width get explicit ranks; long paths P are repetitions wk with primitive w, |w|\u2264\u2113_pattern and k\u2265\u2113_count, and each node knows w. Label as follows:\n  \u2022 For each long P with period w, label the central window of length 2r in every period occurrence by f0(w) (anchored and repeated), thereby fixing a 2r\u2011spaced set of \u201cmid blocks\u201d across P.\n  \u2022 The remaining subpaths between these mid blocks (and any adjacent short/irregular segments) have total length O(\u2113_width+\u2113_pattern)=O(1). For each such S with adjacent periodic contexts represented by w1 and w2, apply (F2) to Gw1,w2,S to complete S locally. (Ends of the path are treated similarly, with one side lacking a further context; in that case the partially labeled path is a prefix/suffix of Gw1,w2,S and is handled within the same constant\u2011radius templates.)\n  \u2022 All fillings are constant\u2011radius choices from precomputed tables indexed by (w1,S,w2), exactly as in the cycle proof.\n  Hence a deterministic O(1) algorithm exists.\n- NEXPTIME verification. As in Lemma 23, checking path\u2011feasibility of f0 reduces to finitely many Gw,1 (one z=1 per w) and finitely many Gw1,w2,S, where S ranges over a representative per Type \u03c4 (Lemmas 11 and 14 guarantee a choice with |S|\u2264\u2113_pump), plus S=\u2205. With T enumerated (Prop. 9) and Ext computed (Props. 5, 19), all checks are boolean table lookups; total time 2^{poly(\u03b2)}.\n\nEndpoint handling in Stage\u20112\n- Unlike Stage\u20111, Stage\u20112\u2019s construction does not require special endpoint witnesses: every short/irregular segment, including the two end segments, falls under the Gw1,w2,S completion rule with one or both contexts being (constant\u2011size) pumped fragments. No extra V_left/V_right matrices are needed; the end segments are simply instances of S.\n\nRelation to the earlier Q_\u03c4 approach\n- The boundary\u2011quadruple certificate Q_\u03c4 (with bridging across arbitrary \u03c4_S) is intuitively sufficient but requires embedding a per\u2011type interior filler to produce node outputs in O(1). The f0\u2011based approach avoids this extra layer and follows the attached paper\u2019s decidable formulation; both are single\u2011exponential in \u03b2. We suggest integrating S2\u2011path using f0 for clarity and alignment with the literature.\n\nMini\u2011lemmas to consider adding (short, testable)\n- Tiny\u2011path completion lemma. Any path of length < K := \u2113_pump+4 is solvable or rejectable in constant radius by enumerating all candidates in Ext for its Type. This justifies the small\u2011n fallback in S1\u2011path and S2\u2011path.\n- Orientation\u2011specialized (\u2113_width,\u2113_count,\u2113_pattern) partition. State the oriented\u2011path version (derivable from the paper\u2019s Lemma 22 without re\u2011orienting) with explicit parameters \u2113_width=\u2113_pattern=\u2113_pump and \u2113_count=2\u2113_pump+2.\n\nSanity checks and examples for S2\u2011path\n- Equality LCL (E={(c,c)}, A_0=A_1={c}). Take f0(w)\u2261c^{|w|}. Gw,1 and all Gw1,w2,S mid\u2011blocks are trivially consistent. Classified O(1) (agrees with S1\u2011path acceptance).\n- Proper 2\u2011coloring on oriented paths. f0 cannot satisfy (F1) across Gw,1 (mid\u2011block requires a consistent 2r window under period\u20111), so S2\u2011path rejects; S1\u2011path accepts with f_mid, hence \u0398(log* n).\n\nActionable next steps for output.md\n1) Add S2\u2011path (Stage\u20112 theorem for oriented paths) using the f0 certificate: definitions of Gw,z and Gw1,w2,S, the feasibility conditions (F1)\u2013(F2), the two directions of the equivalence, and the NEXPTIME verification argument.\n2) Insert the oriented\u2011path (\u2113_width,\u2113_count,\u2113_pattern) partition statement with parameters and a short proof sketch (pointing to the paper\u2019s Lemmas 20\u201322, noting global orientation simplifies the orientation step).\n3) Clean up numbering and the lingering Stage\u20111 remark; align Prop. 9\u2019s transition cost to O(\u03b2^4) where referenced.\n4) Optionally add the tiny\u2011path completion lemma to justify the small\u2011n fallback.\n\nWhy this is incremental and auditable\n- All added checks for S2\u2011path reduce to Ext\u2011table membership (finite, precomputable) and pumping lemmas already in output.md; the structure matches the paper\u2019s decidable formulation (Lemma 23). The verifier modifications (table sizes, enumeration scopes, and complexity bounds) remain within 2^{poly(\u03b2)}.\n- The proposed edits are localized: no changes to S1\u2011path content, just removal of an obsolete remark and consistency fixes, plus the new S2\u2011path section with explicit definitions and a proof outline tied to existing lemmas.\n"
