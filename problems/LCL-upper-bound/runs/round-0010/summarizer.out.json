  "summary_md": "Round 0010 audited output.md and proposed a concrete Stage\u20112 plan for globally oriented paths. Key editorial fixes were flagged (numbering collisions, Prop.9\u2019s transition\u2011cost text should be O(\u03b2^4), and a tiny\u2011path fallback lemma to justify small\u2011n cases). Stage\u20111 endpoint handling was cleaned up: strengthened endpoint witnesses g_L/g_R close the gap and endpoint extraction was rephrased to avoid undefined padding. A path\u2011specialized Stage\u20112 certificate f0 (definitions Gw,z and Gw1,w2,S, feasibility conditions F1\u2013F2) was proposed; Theorem S2\u2011path states O(1) iff a path\u2011feasible f0 exists, otherwise \u0398(log* n), with NEXPTIME verifiability via finite Ext/T tables (2^{poly(\u03b2)}). Verifier optimizations (incremental Left/RightColors via Left3_\u03c4, L_allow/R_allow identities, early infeasibility filters) and testable lemmas (tiny\u2011path completion, oriented partition) were suggested. Verifier verdict: partial success. Citations: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json.",
  "highlights": [
    "Editorial fixes: remove/rewrite obsolete Stage\u20111 remark; renumber/group base cases (6/6A/6B/7); align Prop.9 to O(\u03b2^4) where corrected.",
    "Endpoint coupling gap closed: strengthened witnesses g_L/g_R include alignment clause (\u03b22\u2208OutR2(\u03c4_b,s), \u03b21\u2208OutL1(\u03c4_c,s)) and endpoint extraction phrased without undefined left padding.",
    "Stage\u20112 (oriented paths) certificate f0 defined via Gw,z and Gw1,w2,S with feasibility (F1,F2); Theorem S2\u2011path: existence of f0 \u21d4 O(1) else \u0398(log* n); verifiable in NEXPTIME by table lookups (2^{poly(\u03b2)}).",
    "Stage\u20112 endpoints need no special V_left/V_right machinery: end segments are handled as Gw1,w2,S instances (one side may be empty).",
    "Verifier speedups: maintain Left3_\u03c4 to update RightColors/LeftColors in O(\u03b2^3) per long append; precompute L_allow/R_allow as E\u2011neighborhoods; add early infeasibility filters F1/F2 to prune searches.",
    "Actionables: add S2\u2011path section with f0 certificate and NEXPTIME checks, tiny\u2011path completion lemma, oriented partition statement, regression tests (incl. endpoint misalignment cases) and MIS\u2011Kth\u2011power spacing lemma."

  "next_questions": [
    "Integrate S2\u2011path into output.md using the f0 certificate (Gw,z, Gw1,w2,S, F1\u2013F2) and add the tiny\u2011path completion and oriented partition lemmas\u2014can you draft that section and the minimal proofs/checklists?",
    "Confirm and propagate the Prop.9 cost correction (O(\u03b2^4)) and decide a renumbering strategy for base cases (merge/group 6/6A/6B/7) to avoid reader confusion?",
    "Implement verifier optimizations: precompute Left3_\u03c4, L_allow/R_allow bitsets, add filters F1/F2, and add regression tests (incremental Left/RightColors, endpoint misalignment counterexamples, Prop.9 runtime checks) \u2014 who will own these tests?"
