Round 0010 — audit of output.md, endpoint-cleanup notes, and a concrete Stage‑2 plan for oriented paths (O(1) vs Θ(log* n))

Audit of output.md (gaps, inconsistencies, and easy fixes)
- Duplicate/contradictory remarks on Stage‑1: There is still a “Remark (Stage‑1 equivalence pending endpoint treatment)” before Lemma E2, but Theorem S1‑path later resolves endpoint issues. This is now inconsistent. Suggested fix: remove or rewrite the earlier remark to forward‑reference Theorem S1‑path.
- Numbering collisions and duplication:
  • Proposition 6, 6A, 6B all exist; 6 and 6B both are base cases (k=1→2 and k=2→3) and 6A is another base case (k_flag=1 variant). Consider renumbering to 6 (k=1→2), 7 (k=2→3), 8 (k=3→4), or add clear “(Base cases)” headers to avoid confusion.
  • Concatenation appears as Lemma 2 (k_flag≥4) and Lemma 11 (all k_flag). Lemma 11 strictly subsumes Lemma 2; a short note stating “Lemma 11 subsumes Lemma 2” would prevent confusion.
- Transition‑cost mismatch: Proposition 9 still states “Each transition costs O(β^5) in the k_flag≥4 regime,” while a later “Correction to Proposition 9” paragraph records the improved O(β^4) bound (via Proposition 19). These must be aligned; keep the O(β^4) bound in the definitive statement of Proposition 9.
- Small‑n fallback in Theorem S1‑path (⇐): It says “0 or 1 separators handled by brute‑force completion using Ext tables in constant radius.” This is plausible, but a one‑line lemma would clarify that any path of length < K can be labeled (or rejected) by a constant‑time rule derived from Ext (finite lookup radius K). This would parallel Lemma E2’s style, ensuring no gap at tiny n.
- Orientation/convention reminder: Theorem S1‑path relies on the global convention (L1,L2,R2,R1); all seam references are consistent with earlier definitions. No action, but a short “Indexing reminder” near Definition of OutR2/OutL1 would help readers.

Endpoint coupling in Stage‑1 — sanity check on the new content
- The strengthened endpoint witnesses g_L(τ_end,s,τ_b), g_R(τ_c,s,τ_end), with (iii) β2∈OutR2(τ_b,s), β1∈OutL1(τ_c,s), are now integrated and correctly cover the first/last interior block via W_{b⊙c}. This closes the earlier gap.
- Preprocessing coverage is complete: T and T_long (Prop. 9), Ext (Lemmas 1, 11), W (Prop. 21), V_left/V_right (Lemma E1), and OutR2/OutL1 are all defined. The NEXPTIME verification clause is sound.

Stage‑2 on globally oriented paths (O(1) vs Θ(log* n)) — proposed path‑specific certificate and theorem
Rationale. To complete the trichotomy with a single‑exponential (in β) nondeterministic verifier, it is convenient to mirror the paper’s Section 4.4 feasible‑function framework, specialized to oriented paths. This avoids having to synthesize interior outputs from bare boundary quadruples and leverages the (ℓ_width,ℓ_count,ℓ_pattern) partition (Section 4.3 in the paper) in O(1) rounds.

Definitions (path specialization; reusing the paper’s Gw,z and Gw1,w2,S)
- Fix r=1 and ℓ_pump=|T| from Prop. 9. For any 1≤|w|≤ℓ_pump and z≥0, Gw,z is the path wr · wz · wr with complete output labeling f0(w)^{z+2r} (here f0 is a Stage‑2 function; see below). Mid(Gw,z): the central wz.
- For any w1,w2 with 1≤|wi|≤ℓ_pump and any S (possibly empty), Gw1,w2,S is the path w1^{ℓ_pump+2r} · S · w2^{ℓ_pump+2r} with a partial labeling that fixes the first 2r|w1| outputs to f0(w1)^{2r} and the last 2r|w2| outputs to f0(w2)^{2r}. Mid(Gw1,w2,S): w1^{ℓ_pump+r} · S · w2^{ℓ_pump+r}.
- Stage‑2 feasible function for paths. A map f0: {w ∈ Σ_in^k : 1≤k≤ℓ_pump} → Σ_out^k is path‑feasible if:
  (F1) For each w, the complete labeling f0(w) is locally legal, and for Gw,1 the labeling is locally consistent on Mid(Gw,1). (Equivalently, Gw,z is locally consistent on its mid for all z≥1.)
  (F2) For each Gw1,w2,S, there exists a completion L⋄ that is locally consistent on Mid(Gw1,w2,S).
Remark. This is the path analogue of the cycle notion used in the attached paper (Lemmas 23–27), with the same quantitative parameters (ℓ_pump) and “mid‑block extendibility” semantics; the only change is that we do not wrap ends.

Theorem S2‑path (O(1) vs Θ(log* n) on oriented paths; verifiable in NEXPTIME)
- Statement. An r=1 β‑normalized LCL on globally oriented paths has deterministic LOCAL complexity O(1) iff there exists a path‑feasible function f0. Otherwise, if Theorem S1‑path holds but no f0 exists, the complexity is Θ(log* n).
- (⇒) Given an O(1)‑round algorithm A, extract f0 as in the paper’s Lemma 24: for each 1≤|w|≤ℓ_pump, simulate A on wi · w^{2r+1} · wi with distinct IDs confined to a constant halo; define f0(w) as A’s outputs on w (one period). Local legality implies (F1), and by the same mid‑block simulation trick, (F2) holds for all Gw1,w2,S (replace the two long contexts by pumped canonical representatives so that the constant runtime halos are disjoint). This is the path version of Lemmas 24–25.
- (⇐) Given f0, compute in O(1) rounds an (ℓ_width,ℓ_count,ℓ_pattern)‑partition tailored to oriented paths (paper’s Lemma 22; orientation is given, so Lemma 19’s orientation step is unnecessary): short paths of length ≤2ℓ_width get explicit ranks; long paths P are repetitions wk with primitive w, |w|≤ℓ_pattern and k≥ℓ_count, and each node knows w. Label as follows:
  • For each long P with period w, label the central window of length 2r in every period occurrence by f0(w) (anchored and repeated), thereby fixing a 2r‑spaced set of “mid blocks” across P.
  • The remaining subpaths between these mid blocks (and any adjacent short/irregular segments) have total length O(ℓ_width+ℓ_pattern)=O(1). For each such S with adjacent periodic contexts represented by w1 and w2, apply (F2) to Gw1,w2,S to complete S locally. (Ends of the path are treated similarly, with one side lacking a further context; in that case the partially labeled path is a prefix/suffix of Gw1,w2,S and is handled within the same constant‑radius templates.)
  • All fillings are constant‑radius choices from precomputed tables indexed by (w1,S,w2), exactly as in the cycle proof.
  Hence a deterministic O(1) algorithm exists.
- NEXPTIME verification. As in Lemma 23, checking path‑feasibility of f0 reduces to finitely many Gw,1 (one z=1 per w) and finitely many Gw1,w2,S, where S ranges over a representative per Type τ (Lemmas 11 and 14 guarantee a choice with |S|≤ℓ_pump), plus S=∅. With T enumerated (Prop. 9) and Ext computed (Props. 5, 19), all checks are boolean table lookups; total time 2^{poly(β)}.

Endpoint handling in Stage‑2
- Unlike Stage‑1, Stage‑2’s construction does not require special endpoint witnesses: every short/irregular segment, including the two end segments, falls under the Gw1,w2,S completion rule with one or both contexts being (constant‑size) pumped fragments. No extra V_left/V_right matrices are needed; the end segments are simply instances of S.

Relation to the earlier Q_τ approach
- The boundary‑quadruple certificate Q_τ (with bridging across arbitrary τ_S) is intuitively sufficient but requires embedding a per‑type interior filler to produce node outputs in O(1). The f0‑based approach avoids this extra layer and follows the attached paper’s decidable formulation; both are single‑exponential in β. We suggest integrating S2‑path using f0 for clarity and alignment with the literature.

Mini‑lemmas to consider adding (short, testable)
- Tiny‑path completion lemma. Any path of length < K := ℓ_pump+4 is solvable or rejectable in constant radius by enumerating all candidates in Ext for its Type. This justifies the small‑n fallback in S1‑path and S2‑path.
- Orientation‑specialized (ℓ_width,ℓ_count,ℓ_pattern) partition. State the oriented‑path version (derivable from the paper’s Lemma 22 without re‑orienting) with explicit parameters ℓ_width=ℓ_pattern=ℓ_pump and ℓ_count=2ℓ_pump+2.

Sanity checks and examples for S2‑path
- Equality LCL (E={(c,c)}, A_0=A_1={c}). Take f0(w)≡c^{|w|}. Gw,1 and all Gw1,w2,S mid‑blocks are trivially consistent. Classified O(1) (agrees with S1‑path acceptance).
- Proper 2‑coloring on oriented paths. f0 cannot satisfy (F1) across Gw,1 (mid‑block requires a consistent 2r window under period‑1), so S2‑path rejects; S1‑path accepts with f_mid, hence Θ(log* n).

Actionable next steps for output.md
1) Add S2‑path (Stage‑2 theorem for oriented paths) using the f0 certificate: definitions of Gw,z and Gw1,w2,S, the feasibility conditions (F1)–(F2), the two directions of the equivalence, and the NEXPTIME verification argument.
2) Insert the oriented‑path (ℓ_width,ℓ_count,ℓ_pattern) partition statement with parameters and a short proof sketch (pointing to the paper’s Lemmas 20–22, noting global orientation simplifies the orientation step).
3) Clean up numbering and the lingering Stage‑1 remark; align Prop. 9’s transition cost to O(β^4) where referenced.
4) Optionally add the tiny‑path completion lemma to justify the small‑n fallback.

Why this is incremental and auditable
- All added checks for S2‑path reduce to Ext‑table membership (finite, precomputable) and pumping lemmas already in output.md; the structure matches the paper’s decidable formulation (Lemma 23). The verifier modifications (table sizes, enumeration scopes, and complexity bounds) remain within 2^{poly(β)}.
- The proposed edits are localized: no changes to S1‑path content, just removal of an obsolete remark and consistency fixes, plus the new S2‑path section with explicit definitions and a proof outline tied to existing lemmas.

Round 0010 — audits after integrating S1‑path; minor fixes, endpoint extraction hygiene, and incremental lemmas for endpoint projections

Audit of output.md (gaps, small bugs, and numbering)
- Numbering consistency. There are now four “Proposition 6/6A/6B/7” base rules: 6 (k=1→2), 6A (k_flag=1 append), 6B (k=2→3), 7 (k=3→4). This is fine logically but confusing; consider renumbering or grouping the three base updates together (k=1→2, 2→3, 3→4) and listing the k_flag=1 append normalization as a lemma.
- Proposition 9 complexity text still says O(β^5) per long append, while a later correction notes O(β^4) via Proposition 19. Please reconcile in the body of Prop. 9 (replace O(β^5) with O(β^4) for k_flag≥4) so the main statement matches the correction.
- S1‑path (⇒) endpoint extraction: the proof says “run A on w_{τ_end} · S(s) · w_{τ_b} with padding beyond distance R on both sides”. Here τ_end ranges over T (short and long), but w_τ is only defined for τ∈T_long in the pumping construction. Also, for an endpoint there is no left padding beyond the path boundary. This is easily fixed by: (i) replacing w_{τ_end} with “an arbitrary path P_end realizing Type τ_end” (short allowed), and (ii) only padding on the right by choosing w_{τ_b} long enough so the R‑neighborhood around S is contained in w_{τ_b} on its right side; on the left side the endpoint may lie inside the halo, which is intended. The extraction remains valid and captures the true endpoint behavior.
- Minor duplication: Lemma 2 (k_flag≥4 concatenation) is subsumed by Lemma 11 (all k_flags). A note that Lemma 11 subsumes Lemma 2 would avoid potential confusion.

Endpoint mechanics — incremental, checkable additions
1) Fast incremental updates for endpoint projections under append (k_flag≥4)
- Statement. For τ with k_flag(τ)≥4 and τ′=τ·a,
  • LeftColors(τ′) = LeftColors(τ).
  • RightColors(τ′) = { y ∈ A_a : ∃ x1,x2,x3 with Left3_τ[x1,x2,x3]=true and E(x3,y) }.
- Why useful. Lets the verifier update V_left/V_right incrementally during δ‑BFS using the already‑precomputed Left3_τ, avoiding recomputing projections from scratch (O(β^3) instead of scanning all β^4 quadruples).
- Proof sketch. LeftColors projects the first coordinate, which is unaffected by appending a new node at the right. RightColors of τ′ consists of those y that can appear as new R1; by Lemma 1, (x1,x2,x3,y)∈Ext_{τ′} iff Left3_τ[x1,x2,x3] and E(x3,y) and y∈A_a.

2) Endpoint allow sets as E‑neighborhoods (explicit identities)
- Identities. L_allow(τ) := {α : V_left[τ][α]} = N_E(RightColors(τ)), and R_allow(τ) := {α : V_right[α][τ]} = N_E^{-1}(LeftColors(τ)).
- Why useful. Makes explicit that V_left/V_right are just one‑step E‑blowups of the endpoint projections; convenient for unit tests and caching.
- Proof. By the definitions of V_left/V_right and LeftColors/RightColors.

3) Early infeasibility filters for Stage‑1 verification (constant‑time table checks)
- Filter F1 (interior Out‑sets nonempty). If there exist τ_b,s with OutR2(τ_b,s)=∅ or τ_c,s with OutL1(τ_c,s)=∅, then no feasible f_mid can exist — reject.
- Filter F2 (endpoint alignment reachability). For any τ_end,τ_b,s, if L_allow(τ_end)=∅ or OutR2(τ_b,s)=∅, then any g_L(τ_end,s,τ_b) is impossible. Symmetric for g_R.
- Why useful. Fast rejections before scanning W_{b⊙c} matrices; reduces witness search space.
- Justification. Trivial from definitions of Out‑sets and V_left/V_right.

4) Endpoint extraction hygiene for S1‑path (⇒) — revised, auditable phrasing
- Current line: “run A on w_{τ_end} · S(s) · w_{τ_b} … with padding on both sides.”
- Revised statement (suggested edit). For each (τ_end∈T, s, τ_b∈T_long): pick any finite path P_end with Type(P_end)=τ_end; pick w_{τ_b} long (as in the f_mid construction) so that the radius‑R halo of S lies entirely inside w_{τ_b} on the right. Run A on the finite path P := P_end · S(s) · w_{τ_b} (no left padding beyond the endpoint). Define g_L(τ_end,s,τ_b) as the output on S. Local correctness implies (i) node/edge legality. Since the seam edge from P_end into S is respected, V_left[τ_end][β1] holds (ii). Because the right context is of Type τ_b and the halo on that side is entirely inside w_{τ_b}, the second output belongs to OutR2(τ_b,s) (iii). Symmetric for g_R.
- Why this matters. It removes reliance on w_{τ_end} (undefined if τ_end is short) and avoids padding past the endpoint.

Concrete, testable lemmas to consider adding
- Lemma E3 (Bridging equivalence, restated as set inclusion). For τ_b,τ_c and inputs s1,s2, define the seam‑reachable pair set
  R̂_{b⊙c}(s1,s2) := { (α_L,α_R) : W_{b⊙c}[α_L][α_R]=true }.
  Then feasibility of f_mid is equivalent to the pairwise inclusions
  OutR2(τ_b,s1) × OutL1(τ_c,s2) ⊆ R̂_{b⊙c}(s1,s2) for all τ_b,τ_c,s1,s2.
  Proof: Unpack Lemma 20 and Prop. 21.
- Lemma E4 (Endpoint–interior block fill, explicit construction). Given g_L(τ_end,s,τ_b)=(β1,β2) satisfying (i)–(iii) and an interior separator S2 with color pair (α1,α2)=f_mid(τ_c,s2,τ_d), the intervening block between the endpoint separator and S2 admits a completion. Construction: pick (o1,o2,o3,o4) from Ext_{τ_b⊙τ_c} witnessing W_{b⊙c}[β2][α1], then fill by Ext_{τ_b⊙τ_c}; correctness follows from Lemma E2.

Small example to document the need for endpoint alignment (suggested to add as a remark)
- Let Σ_out={a,b}, A_0=A_1=Σ_out, E={(a,a),(b,b)}. Suppose f_mid always outputs (b,b), thus OutR2={b}. Take τ_end with RightColors(τ_end)={a}. If one chose g_L(τ_end,s,τ_b)=(a,a) based only on V_left (true) but ignored alignment (β2∈OutR2), the adjacent interior block would require W_{b⊙c}[a][·], which can be false, and the construction would fail. The alignment clause (iii) prevents this.

Implementation notes (verifier/solver side)
- Precompute Left3_τ during δ‑BFS and use the identities in item 1) to maintain RightColors(·), LeftColors(·), thus V_left/V_right, in O(β^3) per long append.
- For endpoint maps, precompute bit‑sets L_allow(τ) and R_allow(τ) once; checking g_L/g_R then reduces to:
  • membership in A_{s[i]} and E on the 2‑node window (constant time),
  • β1 ∈ L_allow(τ_end) or β2 ∈ R_allow(τ_end),
  • β2 ∈ OutR2(τ_b,s) or β1 ∈ OutL1(τ_c,s).
- Speed hint: during f_mid verification, build per‑pair masks M_{b⊙c}(s1,s2) := {α_L}×{α_R} for α_L∈OutR2(τ_b,s1), α_R∈OutL1(τ_c,s2), and check that M_{b⊙c}(s1,s2) ⊆ R̂_{b⊙c}(s1,s2); if not, report the first violating pair, making counterexamples easy to extract.

Next steps toward full trichotomy (O(1) vs Θ(log* n) vs Θ(n))
- Stage‑2 on oriented paths. Bring in a path‑specialized version of the (ℓ_width,ℓ_count,ℓ_pattern)‑partition (paper’s Lemma 22) with explicit constants compatible with ℓ_pump; then formalize the per‑type tiling witness Q_τ and the constant‑round construction. The checks already sketched in earlier rounds (tiling within τ, universal bridging across τ_S via Ext) should carry over verbatim with our Ext/W machinery.
- MIS on K‑th power (for completeness). Add a brief lemma that on globally oriented paths one can compute an MIS of the K‑th power in O(log* n), and that consecutive MIS nodes are at distance in [K,2K]; cite folklore or include a 3‑line proof via Cole–Vishkin coloring and greedy thinning. This makes the spacing claim in S1‑path fully self‑contained.
- Regression tests. Extend the harness to check:
  • Incremental RightColors/LeftColors updates vs direct projection of Ext after append.
  • S1 verification equivalence in Lemma E3 form (set inclusion) using precomputed R̂_{b⊙c}.
  • Endpoint misalignment: synthesize instances violating (iii) and confirm rejection.
  • Prop. 9 runtime constants: confirm O(β^4) append for k_flag≥4 against O(β^5) brute force on β∈{2,3}.

Why these are incremental and auditable
- Each lemma is a one‑line identity following mechanically from already‑defined objects (Ext and its slices). They admit direct unit tests on small β.
- The endpoint extraction hygiene is a textual correction with unchanged logic; it prevents an uninstantiated symbol (w_{τ_end}) and avoids padding past the endpoint while preserving the argument.
- The feasibility filters F1/F2 are immediate consequences of definitions, implementable as constant‑time table emptiness checks.

Open items (to track)
- Decide whether to keep both Lemma 2 and Lemma 11; if both retained, add an explicit “Lemma 11 subsumes Lemma 2” note.
- Normalize base‑case numbering to avoid 6/6A/6B confusion.
- Integrate the MIS‑on‑Kth‑power statement and the Stage‑2 partition lemma specialized to oriented paths to complete the constant‑time classification.
