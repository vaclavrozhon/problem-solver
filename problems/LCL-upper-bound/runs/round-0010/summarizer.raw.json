Key editorial fixes were flagged (numbering collisions, Prop.9’s transition‑cost text should be O(β^4), and a tiny‑path fallback lemma to justify small‑n cases). Stage‑1 endpoint handling was cleaned up: strengthened endpoint witnesses g_L/g_R close the gap and endpoint extraction was rephrased to avoid undefined padding. A path‑specialized Stage‑2 certificate f0 (definitions Gw,z and Gw1,w2,S, feasibility conditions F1–F2) was proposed; Theorem S2‑path states O(1) iff a path‑feasible f0 exists, otherwise Θ(log* n), with NEXPTIME verifiability via finite Ext/T tables (2^{poly(β)}). Verifier optimizations (incremental Left/RightColors via Left3_τ, L_allow/R_allow identities, early infeasibility filters) and testable lemmas (tiny‑path completion, oriented partition) were suggested. Verifier verdict: partial success.
