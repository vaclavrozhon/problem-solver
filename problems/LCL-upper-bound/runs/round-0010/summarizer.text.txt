  "summary_md": "Round 0010 audited output.md and proposed a concrete Stage‑2 plan for globally oriented paths. Key editorial fixes were flagged (numbering collisions, Prop.9’s transition‑cost text should be O(β^4), and a tiny‑path fallback lemma to justify small‑n cases). Stage‑1 endpoint handling was cleaned up: strengthened endpoint witnesses g_L/g_R close the gap and endpoint extraction was rephrased to avoid undefined padding. A path‑specialized Stage‑2 certificate f0 (definitions Gw,z and Gw1,w2,S, feasibility conditions F1–F2) was proposed; Theorem S2‑path states O(1) iff a path‑feasible f0 exists, otherwise Θ(log* n), with NEXPTIME verifiability via finite Ext/T tables (2^{poly(β)}). Verifier optimizations (incremental Left/RightColors via Left3_τ, L_allow/R_allow identities, early infeasibility filters) and testable lemmas (tiny‑path completion, oriented partition) were suggested. Verifier verdict: partial success. Citations: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json.",
  "highlights": [
    "Editorial fixes: remove/rewrite obsolete Stage‑1 remark; renumber/group base cases (6/6A/6B/7); align Prop.9 to O(β^4) where corrected.",
    "Endpoint coupling gap closed: strengthened witnesses g_L/g_R include alignment clause (β2∈OutR2(τ_b,s), β1∈OutL1(τ_c,s)) and endpoint extraction phrased without undefined left padding.",
    "Stage‑2 (oriented paths) certificate f0 defined via Gw,z and Gw1,w2,S with feasibility (F1,F2); Theorem S2‑path: existence of f0 ⇔ O(1) else Θ(log* n); verifiable in NEXPTIME by table lookups (2^{poly(β)}).",
    "Stage‑2 endpoints need no special V_left/V_right machinery: end segments are handled as Gw1,w2,S instances (one side may be empty).",
    "Verifier speedups: maintain Left3_τ to update RightColors/LeftColors in O(β^3) per long append; precompute L_allow/R_allow as E‑neighborhoods; add early infeasibility filters F1/F2 to prune searches.",
    "Actionables: add S2‑path section with f0 certificate and NEXPTIME checks, tiny‑path completion lemma, oriented partition statement, regression tests (incl. endpoint misalignment cases) and MIS‑Kth‑power spacing lemma."
  ],
  "next_questions": [
    "Integrate S2‑path into output.md using the f0 certificate (Gw,z, Gw1,w2,S, F1–F2) and add the tiny‑path completion and oriented partition lemmas—can you draft that section and the minimal proofs/checklists?",
    "Confirm and propagate the Prop.9 cost correction (O(β^4)) and decide a renumbering strategy for base cases (merge/group 6/6A/6B/7) to avoid reader confusion?",
    "Implement verifier optimizations: precompute Left3_τ, L_allow/R_allow bitsets, add filters F1/F2, and add regression tests (incremental Left/RightColors, endpoint misalignment counterexamples, Prop.9 runtime checks) — who will own these tests?"
