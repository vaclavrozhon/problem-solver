Overall status: Solid progress. The Stage‑1 path theorem is essentially in place, but a few correctness and hygiene fixes are still needed in output.md. The proposed Stage‑2 (O(1) vs Θ(log* n)) plan via the path‑feasible f0 certificate looks promising, but it depends on a constant‑time partition lemma that we have not yet formalized in this write‑up; do not add S2 to output.md yet.
