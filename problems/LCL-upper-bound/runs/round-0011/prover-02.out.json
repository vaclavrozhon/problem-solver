  "progress_md": "Round 0011 \u2014 Endpoint\u2011coupled Stage\u20111 is in place; hygiene fixes, tiny\u2011path fallback, and small auxiliary lemmas for verification and preprocessing\n\nAudit of output.md (gaps and clarifications)\n- Numbering hygiene. Base cases appear as Proposition 6 (k=1\u21922), Proposition 6B (k=2\u21923), and Proposition 7 (k=3\u21924), plus Proposition 6A for k_flag=1 append. This is logically fine but confusing; consider grouping the three base updates under a common \u201cBase cases\u201d header (or renumber 6,7,8) and keep the k_flag=1 variant as a lemma.\n- Interior separator wording (minor ambiguity). In Theorem S1\u2011path (\u21d0), the bullet \u201cInterior separators: For each separator between long blocks of types \u03c4_b and \u03c4_c with local inputs s1 and s2 on its two adjacent 2\u2011node windows \u2026\u201d is ambiguous (a single separator has one 2\u2011node window and one input s). Suggested clarification: \u201cFor each separator S with adjacent long types (\u03c4_L,\u03c4_R) and input s, set its 2\u2011node output to f_mid(\u03c4_L,s,\u03c4_R). For a pair of consecutive separators S1,S2 (with adjacent long types \u03c4_b,\u03c4_c to the middle block and inputs s1,s2), use W_{b\u2299c}[\u03b1_L][\u03b1_R] with \u03b1_L = second(f_mid at S1) and \u03b1_R = first(f_mid at S2) to fill the intervening block.\u201d\n- \u0394 symbol not defined. Propositions 19 and 21 use \u0394 (maximum out\u2011degree of E). Add a one\u2011line definition near Setup: \u201cLet \u0394 := max_{x\u2208\u03a3_out} |{y : E(x,y)}|.\u201d\n\nTiny\u2011path fallback (to justify the small\u2011n cases in S1\u2011path)\nLemma TP (constant\u2011radius completion for tiny paths). Let K := \u2113_pump+4. There exists a constant M = 2K such that any globally oriented path of length \u2264 M can be solved (or rejected) by a deterministic LOCAL algorithm in O(1) rounds using the precomputed Ext tables.\nSketch proof. Precompute, offline, for each input t with |t| \u2264 M, whether Ext_t \u2260 \u2205 and, if so, a witness labeling for each admissible boundary quadruple; by dynamic programming this is O(\u03b2^4\u00b72^M) preprocessing (constant in \u03b2). At runtime, each node gathers its entire path in M rounds (a constant) and applies the precomputed decision for its exact instance. This justifies the \u201c0 or 1 separator\u201d fallback in S1\u2011path. Why useful: removes the last informal piece in the (\u21d0) direction.\n\nEndpoint\u2011projection identities (implementation/verification aids)\nLemma E1\u2032 (allow sets as E\u2011neighborhoods). Define L_allow(\u03c4):={\u03b1:V_left[\u03c4][\u03b1]} and R_allow(\u03c4):={\u03b1:V_right[\u03b1][\u03c4]}. Then L_allow(\u03c4)=N_E(RightColors(\u03c4)) and R_allow(\u03c4)=N_E^{-1}(LeftColors(\u03c4)).\nProof. Immediate from definitions of V_left,V_right and the endpoint projections. Why useful: quick consistency checks and caches for verifying g_L,g_R.\n\nIncremental updates of endpoint projections under append (k_flag\u22654)\nLemma INC (fast update). For \u03c4 with k_flag(\u03c4)\u22654 and \u03c4\u2032=\u03c4\u00b7a,\n- LeftColors(\u03c4\u2032)=LeftColors(\u03c4).\n- RightColors(\u03c4\u2032)={ y\u2208A_a : \u2203x1,x2,x3 with Left3_\u03c4[x1,x2,x3] and E(x3,y) }.\nProof. Left endpoint is unchanged by appending on the right. For the right endpoint, use Lemma 1 in the Left3 formulation (Prop. 19) and project to R1. Why useful: enables incremental maintenance of V_left/V_right during \u03b4\u2011BFS in O(\u03b2^3) per long append.\n\nEarly infeasibility filters for Stage\u20111 verification\n- F1 (nonempty Out\u2011sets). If \u2203(\u03c4_b,s) with OutR2(\u03c4_b,s)=\u2205 or \u2203(\u03c4_c,s) with OutL1(\u03c4_c,s)=\u2205, then no feasible f_mid exists (reject early). Reason: universal extendibility requires these sets to be nonempty to produce seam colors.\n- F2 (endpoint viability). If L_allow(\u03c4_end)=\u2205 or R_allow(\u03c4_end)=\u2205, then no endpoint map g_L/g_R exists for \u03c4_end. Reason: V_left/V_right must be satisfiable for at least one seam color.\nWhy useful: reduces certificate search space and speeds up negative instances.\n\nExplicit clarification for Out\u2011set feasibility check\nLemma E3 (already implied; restated). For all long \u03c4_b,\u03c4_c and inputs s1,s2, the universal clause is equivalent to OutR2(\u03c4_b,s1)\u00d7OutL1(\u03c4_c,s2) \u2286 {(\u03b1_L,\u03b1_R): W_{b\u2299c}[\u03b1_L][\u03b1_R]=true}. Proof is a direct unpacking of Lemma E2 and the definition of W. Why useful: matches the verifier\u2019s implementation (matrix inclusion tests on \u03b2\u00d7\u03b2 masks).\n\nSanity check on endpoint coupling (toy obstruction)\n- Minimal obstruction persists if (iii) is dropped: choose \u03c4_b with OutR2(\u03c4_b,s)={\u03b1} and pick g_L with second output \u03b22\u2260\u03b1 but V_left true; the block between the endpoint separator and the next interior separator may be unfillable as all W_{b\u2299c}[\u03b22][\u00b7] can be false. This validates the necessity of the alignment condition in g_L/g_R.\n\nComplexity accounting (verification)\n- Precompute T via \u03b4 (Prop. 9) with O(\u03b2^4) per long append (Prop. 19), |T| \u2264 4\u00b72^{\u03b2^4}. Split T_long.\n- Build Ext_\u03c4 for \u03c4\u2208T and Ext_{\u03c4_b\u2299\u03c4_c} for all \u03c4_b,\u03c4_c\u2208T_long (Prop. 5), then W_{b\u2299c} (Prop. 21), and V_left,V_right (endpoint projections). These are all in 2^{poly(\u03b2)}.\n- Certificate sizes: f_mid has |T_long|^2\u00b74 entries; g_L has |T|\u00b7|T_long|\u00b74; g_R symmetric. Verification is table lookups; filters F1\u2013F2 prune trivially impossible instances.\n\nActionable edits to output.md\n1) Add the \u0394 definition (max out\u2011degree of E) in Setup; align Prop. 19/21 text to refer to \u0394 explicitly.\n2) Insert Lemma TP (tiny\u2011path fallback) with a one\u2011paragraph proof to justify small\u2011n handling.\n3) Add Lemma E1\u2032 (allow\u2011set identities) under the endpoint projections section (optional but harmless and testable).\n4) Optionally add Lemma INC (incremental endpoint projections) in the preprocessing/complexity section as an implementation remark to speed \u03b4\u2011BFS.\n5) Clarify the interior separator wording in S1\u2011path (\u21d0) as noted above.\n\nNext steps toward full trichotomy (kept out of output.md per prior guidance)\n- Formalize the oriented\u2011path (\u2113_width,\u2113_count,\u2113_pattern) partition (constant rounds) with parameters \u2113_width=\u2113_pattern=\u2113_pump and \u2113_count=2\u2113_pump+2; then port the f0\u2011based Stage\u20112 certificate into output.md. All checks reduce to finitely many Gw,1 and Gw1,w2,S instances with types bounded by \u2113_pump.\n- Add a short \u201ctype detection within blocks\u201d remark: since K=\u2113_pump+4 is constant, each separator can learn the input of its O(K) neighborhood in O(1) rounds and determine the adjacent long/short types locally.\n\nWhy these are incremental and auditable\n- Each lemma is a local identity or constant\u2011radius construction derived mechanically from Ext and already\u2011defined slices (Left3), and can be unit\u2011tested on small \u03b2 by direct enumeration.\n- The tiny\u2011path fallback removes an informal step, and the \u0394 definition plus interior\u2011separator wording fix readability issues without changing substance.\n- Early filters F1\u2013F2 are simple emptiness checks and can be added to the verifier immediately.\n"
