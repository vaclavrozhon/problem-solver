Key technical move: replace an f0-on-words certificate with per-type quadruples Q_τ ∈ Ext_τ plus a new one‑sided endpoint bridging clause so verification stays single‑exponential in β (avoids a doubly‑exponential blowup). An O(1)-round oriented‑path partition lemma splits a path into short separators and long periodic blocks; Plong blocks are tiled by Q_τ, interior short separators use two‑sided bridging, and endpoint short separators use the one‑sided clause. NEXPTIME verification enumerates T and Ext_τ and checks (1) local wrap, (2) universal two‑sided bridging, and (3) one‑sided endpoint bridging; cost is single‑exponential in β.
