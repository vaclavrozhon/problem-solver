  "summary_md": "Round 0011 finalizes a Stage‑2 certificate and an O(1) construction for β‑normalized radius‑1 LCLs on globally oriented paths, and records verifier hygiene/fallback fixes. Key technical move: replace an f0-on-words certificate with per-type quadruples Q_τ ∈ Ext_τ plus a new one‑sided endpoint bridging clause so verification stays single‑exponential in β (avoids a doubly‑exponential blowup). An O(1)-round oriented‑path partition lemma splits a path into short separators and long periodic blocks; Plong blocks are tiled by Q_τ, interior short separators use two‑sided bridging, and endpoint short separators use the one‑sided clause. NEXPTIME verification enumerates T and Ext_τ and checks (1) local wrap, (2) universal two‑sided bridging, and (3) one‑sided endpoint bridging; cost is single‑exponential in β. Verifier notes add tiny‑path fallback, Δ (out‑degree) definition, incremental endpoint projection lemmas, early infeasibility filters F1/F2, and unit‑test suggestions. Verifier verdict: partial success.",
  "highlights": [
    "Stage‑2 certificate for oriented paths: per‑type interfaces Q_τ = (L1,L2,R2,R1) plus a one‑sided endpoint bridging clause (3) — enables O(1) classification vs Θ(log* n).",
    "Oriented‑path partition lemma (O(1) rounds): partition into short separators (≤2ℓ_width) and long periodic segments (primitive period ≤ ℓ_pattern, repeated ≥ ℓ_count); each node knows its role and pattern.",
    "O(1) labeling algorithm: tile each Plong by repeating Q_τ (wrap E(R1,L1)); fill interior separators by two‑sided Ext matches; fill endpoint separators by one‑sided Ext matches.",
    "NEXPTIME verifier stays single‑exponential in β: enumerate T and Ext_τ, check (1) local wrap, (2) |T_long|^2·|T|·β^O(1) two‑sided checks, and (3) |T_long|·|T|·β^O(1) endpoint checks — avoids doubly‑exponential blowup.",
    "Tiny‑path completion lemma (constant rounds) justifies small‑n fallbacks (gather full tiny path and consult precomputed Ext table).",
    "Verifier hygiene and implementation aids: add Δ definition, clarify interior‑separator wording, incremental endpoint updates (INC), early filters F1/F2, RightAllow/LeftAllow bitsets, and unit‑test matrices."

  "next_questions": [
    "Add Theorem S2‑path (statement, (⇒)/(⇐) proofs, NEXPTIME verification argument) and insert the oriented‑path partition lemma (P‑Partition) specialized with ℓ_width=ℓ_pattern=ℓ_pump, ℓ_count=2ℓ_pump+2 into output.md.",
    "Add Lemma Tiny (tiny‑path completion) and the Δ definition + interior‑separator wording fixes; implement verifier updates (precompute Ext, RightAllow/LeftAllow, W matrices) and run unit tests to resolve the verifier's 'partial success' verdict.",
    "Optional: formally verify parameter choices and portability of the partition lemma from the paper (Lemmas 20–22) and finalize small‑n constants used across S1/S2 proofs."
