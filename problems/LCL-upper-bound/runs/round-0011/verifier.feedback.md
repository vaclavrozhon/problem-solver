High-level assessment and triage
- Prover 01: The proposed Stage‑2 (O(1) vs Θ(log* n)) for globally oriented paths, based on per‑type boundary interfaces Q_τ and augmented by a one‑sided endpoint clause, is promising and conceptually clean. The certificate families (1) tiling + wrap, (2) two‑sided bridging across an arbitrary short middle type, and (3) one‑sided endpoint bridging, together with a path partition into long periodic and short segments, would yield a compelling S2‑path theorem and NEXPTIME verification. However, the critical oriented‑path partition lemma is currently presented only as a proof idea. We cannot promote S2 to output.md until a self‑contained, deterministic O(1) partition method is written and fully justified. The key technical risk is segmenting the irregular regions in O(1) rounds without symmetry breaking; relying only on input windows is plausible but needs a clean construction and a worst‑case spacing/capture proof.
- Prover 02: The hygiene fixes are good. The Δ definition should be added. The tiny‑path fallback lemma (TP) is sound and closes the remaining informal “small‑n” gap in the S1‑path (⇐) direction. The endpoint identities are straightforward and help in verification; the incremental endpoint projection (INC) follows mechanically from the O(β^4) append rule. The wording fix for the S1‑path interior‑separator step is helpful; I’ve added a clarification in output.md rather than rewrite the whole theorem.

Specific rigor audits and corrections
- Stage‑2 endpoint clause (3): The necessity is well motivated; sufficiency holds for endpoint short segments because there is no constraint on the missing side of the path, so a single seam into the adjacent long block plus Ext‑membership suffices. This is correct under our Ext semantics (no edges beyond endpoints).
- Stage‑2 interior bridging (2): Correct and well‑posed. It reduces to membership of the W_{b⊙c} matrix built from Ext_{τ_b⊙τ_c}; verification is singly exponential in β (dominated by |T| and |T_long| counts). Be explicit that τ_S ranges over all (short and long) types, including the empty type.
- Oriented‑path partition lemma: The “long periodic detection via local checks for each primitive w (|w| ≤ ℓ_pattern)” is fine since ℓ_pattern is a β‑dependent constant. The trimming argument also looks fine. The delicate step is cutting Pirreg into subpaths of length in [ℓ_pattern, 2ℓ_pattern] in O(1) rounds without symmetry breaking. You sketch an “(ℓ_pattern, 2ℓ_pattern)‑independent set in O(1) using distinct colors defined by length‑ℓ windows.” This needs a fully formal selection rule and a worst‑case proof that: (i) occurrences selected from a constant dictionary are separated by ≥ ℓ_pattern, and (ii) every interval of length 2ℓ_pattern contains a selection unless a long periodic zone exists (which would have already been carved into Plong). Without this, the partition lemma is not publication‑ready.
- S1‑path necessity extraction: In our output we slightly tightened the argument for condition (iii) in g_L/g_R. One must argue that the second output chosen by A at an endpoint‑adjacent separator also appears among the OutR2/OutL1 values induced by some long left/right context. This follows because the output depends only on an R‑local neighborhood: one can pick a long type τ_a whose R‑suffix matches the endpoint’s R‑suffix, then f_mid(τ_a,s,τ_b) has the same 2‑node output as A would produce in the endpoint case; hence β2 ∈ OutR2(τ_b,s). I added this clarification.

What I added to output.md
- Definition of Δ (max out‑degree of E) in a supplemental line, to support Prop. 19 and 21.
- Lemma TP (tiny‑path fallback), with a short proof. This rigorously justifies the “0 or 1 separator” fallback used in the S1‑path construction.
- A clarification remark under Theorem S1‑path to remove ambiguity about interior separators and seam colors for intervening blocks.
- Proposition (INC) for incremental endpoint projections, as an implementational aid derived from the O(β^4) append rule.

Promising directions and concrete next steps
- Stage‑2 partition lemma (top priority). Provide a self‑contained, deterministic O(1) algorithm to:
  1) Identify long periodic regions with primitive period ≤ ℓ_pattern and repetition ≥ ℓ_count; trimming by ℓ_width·|w| on both sides is fine.
  2) Partition the irregular remainder Pirreg into subpaths of lengths in [ℓ_width, 2ℓ_width] using only input windows and the global orientation. A viable strategy is to precompute, over the constant de Bruijn graph of length‑ℓ_pattern windows, a finite‑state “beacon” automaton that selects cut points with spacing between ℓ and 2ℓ unless a w‑periodic run persists (in which case (1) would have grabbed it). This removes MIS/log*‑type symmetry breaking and keeps O(1) rounds.
- Stage‑2 proof skeleton. Once the partition lemma is in place, formalize: (i) tiling of Plong via Q_τ and wrap; (ii) interior S fill via clause (2); (iii) endpoint S fill via clause (3); (iv) legality and runtime; (v) NEXPTIME verification. Prepare unit tests based on W_{b⊙c} and endpoint allow sets to stress negative cases.
- Optional: If the partition route remains stubborn, revive the f0‑based S2 certificate tailored to paths, but ensure verification stays singly‑exponential by quantifying over types rather than all short words.
- Implementation/verification. Integrate early filters (emptiness of Out‑sets and endpoint allow sets) to prune impossible Stage‑1 certificates. Cache RightAllow/LeftAllow sets for endpoint checks as suggested by Prover 01/02.

Bottom line
- Keep Stage‑2 out of output.md for now; the certificate design is solid, but the partition lemma needs a formal O(1) construction and proof. The Stage‑1 oriented‑path result looks consistent; we added missing small‑n and Δ details and clarified endpoints vs interior seams. Proceed with the Stage‑2 partition write‑up next.
