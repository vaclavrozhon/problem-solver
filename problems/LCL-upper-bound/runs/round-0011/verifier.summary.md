High-level assessment and triage
- Prover 01: The proposed Stage‑2 (O(1) vs Θ(log* n)) for globally oriented paths, based on per‑type boundary interfaces Q_τ and augmented by a one‑sided endpoint clause, is promising and conceptually clean. The certificate families (1) tiling + wrap, (2) two‑sided bridging across an arbitrary short middle type, and (3) one‑sided endpoint bridging, together with a path partition into long periodic and short segments, would yield a compelling S2‑path theorem and NEXPTIME verification. However, the critical oriented‑path partition lemma is currently presented only as a proof idea. We cannot promote S2 to output.md until a self‑contained, deterministic O(1) partition method is written and fully justified. The key technical risk is segmenting the irregular regions in O(1) rounds without symmetry breaking; relying only on input windows is plausible but needs a clean construction and a worst‑case spacing/capture proof.
- Prover 02: The hygiene fixes are good.
