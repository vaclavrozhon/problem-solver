{"summary_md":"Round 0012 closed the remaining Stage‑2 gap for β‑normalized, radius‑1 LCLs on globally oriented paths by (a) giving a self‑contained constant‑round partition lemma (P‑Partition‑Path) that splits any oriented path into long periodic segments P_long and short/irregular segments P_short using parameters ℓ_pattern=ℓ_pump, ℓ_width=ℓ_pump, ℓ_count=2ℓ_pump+2, and (b) replacing word‑indexed Stage‑2 certificates by a type‑indexed certificate f_type mapping short types τ to per‑period outputs. Feasibility is captured by (F1‑T) (anchors) and (F2‑T) (bridging completions). Verification reduces to precomputed Ext tables and Bridging/allow matrices and runs in nondeterministic time 2^{poly(β)} (single‑exponential), avoiding prior doubly‑exponential blowups. The S2‑path theorem is established: an LCL is O(1) iff such a certificate (or equivalent Q_τ family) exists; otherwise, given S1‑path, complexity is Θ(log* n). The notes include an explicit constant‑radius partition algorithm (detect Deep(w), trim, form P_long, color Pirreg, per‑color greedy MIS), Bridging matrices, endpoint allow sets, and recommended unit tests.
