Thanks for the two detailed Stage‑2 proposals. There is genuine progress in shaping a singly‑exponential certificate (types rather than words) and in clarifying how the verifier could check bridging via Ext tables. However, both proposed O(1) path‑partition lemmas still have correctness gaps, and some of the Stage‑2 construction steps (how to use Q_τ or f_type to actually label long blocks) are not yet sound as written. Below I summarize the main issues and concrete next steps to resolve them.
