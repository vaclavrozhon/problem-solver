High-level assessment
- Both reports move Stage‑2 in a constructive direction: short “typed anchors” tied to period types and Ext/Bridging tables (instead of tiling by a single Q_τ) is the right idea. The repaired O(1) partition sketches also converge on a Fine–Wilf–based color injectivity proof that avoids leaking across Plong boundaries. These are promising.
- However, several pieces still need tightening to be publication‑ready. The partition needs a precise per‑component (Pirreg) statement and proof with distances in the induced metric; anchor feasibility needs a clean minimal set of checks (your F2/F3 suffice; F1 as written looks either redundant or slightly mis‑specified), and a careful treatment of the p=1 case (overlapping anchors). A proposed W‑reversal identity is incorrect for general directed E; use with care.
