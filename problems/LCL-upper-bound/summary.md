This round specialized the paper's feasible-function framework to radius-1, β-normalized LCLs on globally oriented paths and developed an explicit single-exponential finite-state abstraction (types). We proved a type-count bound |T| ≤ 16·2^{β^4}, gave a deterministic DP to enumerate reachable types and compute the append-one-bit successor δ in time 2^{poly(β)}, and defined per-type macro relations R_t summarizing how a block bridges outside outputs. Using these primitives we sketched NEXPTIME verifiers: (i) guess a type-indexed feasible function F to separate Ω(n) vs o(n); (ii) guess per-type boundary quadruples Q_t to separate O(1) vs Ω(log* n). The Verifier flagged a critical soundness gap: naive composition of R_t via an intermediate label m is unsound — one must compute concatenated summaries (Ext) and derive R for the concatenation (a small 3-color counterexample demonstrates the failure). Next steps are to formalize/correct δ, fix bridging composition, and prove the boundary-interface witness equivalence.

Round 0002: fixed the r=1 DP and repaired verifier soundness. Derived an exact append-one-bit recurrence for Ext-tables with explicit k=1,2,3 base cases and proved append-congruence (with the practical caveat that types must carry a k_flag for short lengths). Replaced the unsound R-composition by an Ext-level concatenation lemma and supplied a minimal 3-symbol counterexample (a→b→c). Gave a deterministic BFS to enumerate reachable types (type = (b_in, Ext, k_flag)), bounded |T| ≤ 16·2^{β^4} and O(β^5) per-append, so preprocessing is 2^{poly(N)}. Rewrote both NEXPTIME verifiers (Ω(n) vs o(n) and O(1) vs Ω(log* n)) to use Ext-concatenation with explicit universal checks and provided pseudocode. Remaining polishing: fix the k=2 base-case wording, add unit/regression tests, and complete a full equivalence proof for the boundary-interface witness.
