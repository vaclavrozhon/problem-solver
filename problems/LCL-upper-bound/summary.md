This round specialized the paper's feasible-function framework to radius-1, β-normalized LCLs on globally oriented paths and developed an explicit single-exponential finite-state abstraction (types). We proved a type-count bound |T| ≤ 16·2^{β^4}, gave a deterministic DP to enumerate reachable types and compute the append-one-bit successor δ in time 2^{poly(β)}, and defined per-type macro relations R_t summarizing how a block bridges outside outputs. Using these primitives we sketched NEXPTIME verifiers: (i) guess a type-indexed feasible function F to separate Ω(n) vs o(n); (ii) guess per-type boundary quadruples Q_t to separate O(1) vs Ω(log* n). The Verifier flagged a critical soundness gap: naive composition of R_t via an intermediate label m is unsound — one must compute concatenated summaries (Ext) and derive R for the concatenation (a small 3-color counterexample demonstrates the failure). Next steps are to formalize/correct δ, fix bridging composition, and prove the boundary-interface witness equivalence.

## round-0002 — model summary — 2025-08-27T12:05:19.309268Z
Round 0002: fixed the r=1 DP and repaired verifier soundness. Derived an exact append-one-bit recurrence for Ext-tables with explicit k=1,2,3 base cases and proved append-congruence (with the practical caveat that types must carry a k_flag for short lengths). Replaced the unsound R-composition by an Ext-level concatenation lemma and supplied a minimal 3-symbol counterexample (a→b→c). Gave a deterministic BFS to enumerate reachable types (type = (b_in, Ext, k_flag)), bounded |T| ≤ 16·2^{β^4} and O(β^5) per-append, so preprocessing is 2^{poly(N)}. Rewrote both NEXPTIME verifiers (Ω(n) vs o(n) and O(1) vs Ω(log* n)) to use Ext-concatenation with explicit universal checks and provided pseudocode. Remaining polishing: fix the k=2 base-case wording, add unit/regression tests, and complete a full equivalence proof for the boundary-interface witness.

## round-0003 — model summary — 2025-08-27T14:56:35.613633Z
This round closes two formalization gaps from outputs.pdf and records an optimization. Stage-1: a type-level feasible-function f : T × {0,1}^2 × T → Σ_out^2 is defined with (i) local node constraints and (ii) a universal Ext-concatenation membership condition across separators; existence of f is verifiable in NEXPTIME by computing T and Ext-tables and nondeterministically guessing f. The definition is argued equivalent to the paper’s feasible function (both directions). Stage-2: each type τ gets a boundary-interface witness Q_τ=(L1,L2,R2,R1) with checks (a) local tiling via Ext_τ and wrap-around E, and (b) bridging across any middle type τ_S via Ext membership; if all checks pass the instance is O(1), if Stage-1 passes but Stage-2 fails it’s Θ(log* n), else Θ(n). Optimization: concatenation time reduced from O(β^8) to O(β^6) by precomputing Left/Right 3D slices per type. Examples and endpoint/orientation notes included. Next steps identify formal proofs, the faster routine, and a small regression suite. Citations: prover-01.out.json (progress_md), outputs.pdf.

## round-0004 — model summary — 2025-08-27T15:04:44.798705Z
Round 0004 audit: outputs.md now records the core r=1 ingredients with complete proofs for the high-k append recurrence (k_flag≥4), Ext-level concatenation, congruence (type preserved under append), an explicit counterexample showing R-composition via ∃m is unsound, and an O(β^6) concatenation routine via 3D slices. Missing/needed pieces were identified and concrete additions proposed: an explicit k=1→2 base rule to seed the DP; a deterministic BFS enumeration of Types T and a proof that δ is well-defined with complexity bounds; a reversal operator Rev(·); precise Stage-1 (feasible table f and the o(n)⇔existence-of-f equivalence checked via Ext_{τ⊙σ}); precise Stage-2 (per-type witnesses Q_τ, universal bridging checks, and a constant-round construction); optional Ext_{∅} handling; small sanity/regression tests and an appendix with O(β^6) implementation details. Action items: promote sections 1–5 into outputs.md, add the concatenation appendix, and add regressions (β∈{2,3}). Citations: prover-01.out.json (progress_md); outputs.md (Round 0004).

## round-0005 — model summary — 2025-08-27T15:13:04.337690Z
This round produced a near-complete specification and verification plan for the r=1 oriented-path decision procedure. Key additions: a computable pumping bound ℓ_pump := |T| with two pumping lemmas (prefix and periodic) that let us normalize and lengthen contexts while preserving Types; a general Ext-concatenation lemma (handles short k_flag types) plus associativity and a monotonicity lemma; a Stage-1 theorem S1 equating o(n) complexity with existence of a feasible per-type function f over long types T_long (k_flag≥4), together with an O(log* n) construction and NEXPTIME verifier; and a Stage-2 theorem S2 showing that per-type boundary interfaces Q_τ certify O(1) solvability, with bridging checks that use Ext tables and handle short middle types. Implementation notes cover restricting left/right quantification to T_long, precomputing/caching Ext tables, and verifier complexity (2^{poly(β)}). The verifier returned success. Next steps focus on integrating the lemmas and adding the MIS/partition appendix and regression tests.

## round-0006 — model summary — 2025-08-27T15:24:57.440078Z
Round 0006 audited output.md and supplied small lemmas, implementation optimizations, and sanity checks to close minor gaps in the Stage‑1 machinery. Main fixes: rewrite the δ base case for k_flag=1 using S_τ (Lemma A) so it does not rely on recovering an internal bit; add an endpoint-completion lemma to close the Stage‑1 (⇐) construction for finite directed paths (Lemma B); and rephrase feasible-function verification to quantify only over attainable seam-color sets (Lemma C). An important implementation speedup reduces append from O(β^5) to O(β^4) by precomputing 3D Left3 slices, and further preprocessing of seam-feasibility matrices W_{b⊙c} moves heavy tuple scanning into preprocessing. Sanity checks on equality LCL and 2‑coloring were noted and an actionable checklist of edits and regression tests was supplied. The Verifier returned an "uncertain" verdict. Next work: apply the documented edits, run regression tests, and resolve Stage‑2 (partition lemma vs certificate redesign).

## round-0008 — model summary — 2025-08-27T18:55:32.759824Z
Round 0008: Two provers independently supply the missing endpoint handling and a Stage‑2 certificate specialization for globally oriented paths. They identify and give the explicit k=2→3 base-case needed for the δ DP seed; introduce RightColors/LeftColors and endpoint seam matrices V_left and V_right (Lemma E1) computed from Ext tables to reduce endpoint feasibility to constant-time lookups; and define endpoint witnesses g_L and g_R to accompany the mid-separator feasible function f_mid. Theorem P‑S1 (aka S1‑path) states: an r=1, β‑normalized LCL has deterministic complexity o(n) on oriented paths iff (f_mid,g_L,g_R) satisfying Ext/W_{b⊙c}/V_left/V_right checks exist — existence verifiable in nondeterministic time 2^{poly(β)}. They also propose a Stage‑2 per-type boundary interface Q_τ giving an O(1) construction when tiling/bridging conditions hold, with similar NEXPTIME verification. Action items: insert k=2→3, endpoint projections/matrices and Lemma E1, plus the endpoint-aware Stage‑1 and Stage‑2 statements into output.md. (Sources: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json)

## round-0009 — model summary — 2025-08-27T19:44:21.713594Z
Round 0009 fixes the Stage‑1 certificate for r=1 LCLs on globally oriented paths by coupling endpoint witnesses to interior Out-sets. The main change: g_L: T×{0,1}^2×T_long→Σ_out^2 and g_R: T_long×{0,1}^2×T→Σ_out^2, with three checks — node legality, endpoint seam feasibility (V_left/V_right), and alignment of the interior-directed seam with OutR2/OutL1 from f_mid. f_mid remains the interior separator map (Out-set form) and is verified universally via W_{b⊙c}. Theorem S1-path: an r=1, β-normalized LCL on oriented paths has deterministic complexity o(n) iff such (f_mid,g_L,g_R) exist; existence is verifiable nondeterministically in 2^{poly(β)} time. Proof sketches: (⇒) extract witnesses by pumping and simulating an o(n)-algorithm; (⇐) build an O(log* n) LOCAL algorithm using an MIS on the Kth power, precomputed Ext and W tables, and endpoint fills via V_left/V_right. Prop.19 lowers append costs to O(β^4) in preprocessing. A minimal counterexample shows the alignment clause is necessary. (Citations: prover-02.out.json, prover-01.out.json).

## round-0010 — model summary — 2025-08-27T19:53:26.539089Z
Round 0010 audited output.md and proposed a concrete Stage‑2 plan for globally oriented paths. Key editorial fixes were flagged (numbering collisions, Prop.9’s transition‑cost text should be O(β^4), and a tiny‑path fallback lemma to justify small‑n cases). Stage‑1 endpoint handling was cleaned up: strengthened endpoint witnesses g_L/g_R close the gap and endpoint extraction was rephrased to avoid undefined padding. A path‑specialized Stage‑2 certificate f0 (definitions Gw,z and Gw1,w2,S, feasibility conditions F1–F2) was proposed; Theorem S2‑path states O(1) iff a path‑feasible f0 exists, otherwise Θ(log* n), with NEXPTIME verifiability via finite Ext/T tables (2^{poly(β)}). Verifier optimizations (incremental Left/RightColors via Left3_τ, L_allow/R_allow identities, early infeasibility filters) and testable lemmas (tiny‑path completion, oriented partition) were suggested. Verifier verdict: partial success. Citations: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json.

## round-0011 — model summary — 2025-08-27T20:01:15.325613Z
Round 0011 finalizes a Stage‑2 certificate and an O(1) construction for β‑normalized radius‑1 LCLs on globally oriented paths, and records verifier hygiene/fallback fixes. Key technical move: replace an f0-on-words certificate with per-type quadruples Q_τ ∈ Ext_τ plus a new one‑sided endpoint bridging clause so verification stays single‑exponential in β (avoids a doubly‑exponential blowup). An O(1)-round oriented‑path partition lemma splits a path into short separators and long periodic blocks; Plong blocks are tiled by Q_τ, interior short separators use two‑sided bridging, and endpoint short separators use the one‑sided clause. NEXPTIME verification enumerates T and Ext_τ and checks (1) local wrap, (2) universal two‑sided bridging, and (3) one‑sided endpoint bridging; cost is single‑exponential in β. Verifier notes add tiny‑path fallback, Δ (out‑degree) definition, incremental endpoint projection lemmas, early infeasibility filters F1/F2, and unit‑test suggestions. Verifier verdict: partial success.

## round-0012 — model summary — 2025-08-27T20:15:34.721378Z
Round 0012 closed the remaining Stage‑2 gap for β‑normalized, radius‑1 LCLs on globally oriented paths by (a) giving a self‑contained constant‑round partition lemma (P‑Partition‑Path) that splits any oriented path into long periodic segments P_long and short/irregular segments P_short using parameters ℓ_pattern=ℓ_pump, ℓ_width=ℓ_pump, ℓ_count=2ℓ_pump+2, and (b) replacing word‑indexed Stage‑2 certificates by a type‑indexed certificate f_type mapping short types τ to per‑period outputs. Feasibility is captured by (F1‑T) (anchors) and (F2‑T) (bridging completions). Verification reduces to precomputed Ext tables and Bridging/allow matrices and runs in nondeterministic time 2^{poly(β)} (single‑exponential), avoiding prior doubly‑exponential blowups. The S2‑path theorem is established: an LCL is O(1) iff such a certificate (or equivalent Q_τ family) exists; otherwise, given S1‑path, complexity is Θ(log* n). The notes include an explicit constant‑radius partition algorithm (detect Deep(w), trim, form P_long, color Pirreg, per‑color greedy MIS), Bridging matrices, endpoint allow sets, and recommended unit tests.
