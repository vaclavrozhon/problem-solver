This round specialized the paper's feasible-function framework to radius-1, β-normalized LCLs on globally oriented paths and developed an explicit single-exponential finite-state abstraction (types). We proved a type-count bound |T| ≤ 16·2^{β^4}, gave a deterministic DP to enumerate reachable types and compute the append-one-bit successor δ in time 2^{poly(β)}, and defined per-type macro relations R_t summarizing how a block bridges outside outputs. Using these primitives we sketched NEXPTIME verifiers: (i) guess a type-indexed feasible function F to separate Ω(n) vs o(n); (ii) guess per-type boundary quadruples Q_t to separate O(1) vs Ω(log* n). The Verifier flagged a critical soundness gap: naive composition of R_t via an intermediate label m is unsound — one must compute concatenated summaries (Ext) and derive R for the concatenation (a small 3-color counterexample demonstrates the failure). Next steps are to formalize/correct δ, fix bridging composition, and prove the boundary-interface witness equivalence.
