\paragraph{One-line summary.}
Design a nondeterministic exponential-time algorithm (NEXPTIME algorithm) that decides, given a $\beta$-normalized, radius-1 LCL on globally oriented paths, whether the local complexity of that problem is $O(1)$ vs.\ $\Omega(\log^* n)$ vs.\ $\Omega(n)$.


\section*{Problem setup}


We work in the standard \textsc{Local} model on globally oriented paths. An LCL is \emph{$\beta$-normalized (radius 1)} if it has:
\begin{itemize}
  \item binary input alphabet $\SigIn=\{0,1\}$,
  \item output alphabet $\SigOut$ of size $\beta$,
  \item legality checked only by two tables: $\Cinout\subseteq\SigIn\times\SigOut$ and $\Coutout\subseteq\SigOut\times\SigOut$.
\end{itemize}
A labeling is legal iff $(\mathrm{in}(v),\mathrm{out}(v))\in \Cinout$ at each node $v$ and $(\mathrm{out}(u),\mathrm{out}(v))\in \Coutout$ on each directed edge $u\!\to\! v$.


\paragraph{Encoding size.}
We assume an explicit encoding of $(\Cinout,\Coutout)$ of size $\mathrm{poly}(\beta)$ (e.g., $\Cinout$ as a $2\times \beta$ Boolean table and $\Coutout$ as a $\beta\times \beta$ Boolean table). We measure time in the input length $N=\mathrm{poly}(\beta)$.


\paragraph{Your task}
Your task is to construct as efficient an algorithm as possible for the task of deciding the local complexity of an input $\beta$-normalized problem. Aim for a nondeterministic exponential time algorithm. 


\paragraph{Attached paper}
The attached paper proves that the problem is decidable. Their algorithm is based on the notion of a feasible function and, naively, it needs doubly exponential time. You have to understand that paper thoroughly, since your goal is to improve upon their result.
