For each v=1,\u2026,n\u22121, let i_v be the unique index with \u03c0(i_v)=v and add the edge\n\nE_v: between p_{i_v} and p_{i_{v+1}}.\n\nThe set {E_v : v=1,\u2026,n\u22121} is a spanning tree (a path along value order). Its total weight upper-bounds MST_log(\u03c0).\n\nFor each v, set s_v = |i_{v+1} \u2212 i_v|. Under L1,\n\nw(E_v) = log(1 + (s_v + 1)) = log(2 + s_v) \u2264 log 2 + log(1 + s_v).\n\nLet i^* = max(i_v, i_{v+1}) be the later arrival time of the pair {v, v+1}. When the later one arrives, its most recent true neighbor-in-value is exactly the other endpoint of E_v, hence t_{i^*} = s_v. Since r_{i^*} \u2265 t_{i^*}, we get\n\nw(E_v) \u2264 log 2 + log(1 + r_{i^*}).\n\nSumming over v and grouping by times i^*, note that each time i contributes to at most two edges (neighbors \u00b11), so\n\n\u2211_{v=1}^{n-1} w(E_v) \u2264 (n\u22121) log 2 + 2 \u2211_{i=2}^n log(1 + r_i)\n= (n\u22121) log 2 + 2 \u00b7 Reg_log(\u03c0).\n\nSince for all i\u22652, d_i \u2265 1 and t_i \u2265 1, we have r_i \u2265 2 and thus log(1 + r_i) \u2265 log 3. Therefore Reg_log(\u03c0) \u2265 (n\u22121) log 3. Absorbing the additive term yields the clean multiplicative bound\n\nMST_log(\u03c0) \u2264 (2 + log 2 / log 3) \u00b7 Reg_log(\u03c0) < 2.631 \u00b7 Reg_log(\u03c0).\n\nIn particular, MST_log(\u03c0) \u2264 C_1 \u00b7 Reg_log(\u03c0) with a universal constant C_1 (e.g., C_1 = 3) for any fixed norm and log base.\n\n# Separation showing MST does not dominate Reg\n\nDefine, for even n,\n\n\u03c0(2m\u22121) = m   and   \u03c0(2m) = n/2 + m,  for m = 1,\u2026,n/2.\n\n- MST_log upper bound: Connect odd-index points p_{2m\u22121} to p_{2m+1} (x-gap 2, y-gap 1) and even-index points p_{2m} to p_{2m+2} (x-gap 2, y-gap 1), plus one bridge between the two chains (say p_1 and p_2). Each intra-chain edge has constant log-weight; the bridge costs O(log n). Hence MST_log(\u03c0) = \u0398(n).\n\n- Reg_log lower bound: For i=2m\u22121 \u2265 3, previous \u03c0(i\u22121)=n/2 + (m\u22121). Among earlier indices, exactly m\u22122 even-valued elements lie strictly between; so d_{2m\u22121} = 1 + (m\u22122) = m\u22121. The most recent true neighbor of value m is m\u22121 at index 2m\u22123, so t_{2m\u22121} = 2. Thus r_{2m\u22121} = m+1. For i=2m \u2265 2, similarly d_{2m} = m, t_{2m} = 2, hence r_{2m} = m+2. Therefore\n\nReg_log(\u03c0) = \u2211_{m=1}^{n/2} [log(1 + r_{2m\u22121}) + log(1 + r_{2m})] = \u0398(n log n).\n\nThus Reg_log(\u03c0)/MST_log(\u03c0) = \u0398(log n) \u2192 \u221e. No constant C_2 can satisfy Reg_log \u2264 C_2 \u00b7 MST_log for all permutations.\n\n# Conclusions\n\n- Q1 (Does Reg dominate MST?): Yes. For all \u03c0,\n\n  MST_log(\u03c0) \u2264 (2 + log 2 / log 3) \u00b7 Reg_log(\u03c0) < 2.631 \u00b7 Reg_log(\u03c0).\n\n  In particular, MST_log(\u03c0) \u2264 3 \u00b7 Reg_log(\u03c0) suffices universally (any norm/log base).\n\n- Q2 (Does MST dominate Reg?): No. The alternating-halves family above has Reg_log(\u03c0) = \u0398(n log n) while MST_log(\u03c0) = \u0398(n), so Reg/MST diverges.\n\n- Q3 (Separation): The same family yields Reg_log/MST_log = \u0398(log n) \u2192 \u221e. Moreover, k-block round-robin interleavings (partition values into k contiguous blocks and interleave indices cyclically across blocks) give Reg_log/MST_log \u2273 log(n/k), interpolating between \u0398(n) and \u0398(n log n) regimes while keeping MST_log = \u0398(n) + O(k log n).\n\n# Obstacles / Notes\n\n- Tightening the constant in Q1: The double-counting by at most 2 is the bottleneck. A refined charging that bounds the longer neighbor edge at time i via d_i + t_i (instead of t_i alone) could potentially reduce the constant.\n- The L1 choice made the per-edge inequality exact; other norms introduce only constant-factor additive terms inside the logarithm, absorbed in the final universal constant.\n\n# Next steps\n\n- Attempt to bound, for steps where both neighbors are present, the longer index-gap s_long by O(d_i + t_i), to improve the constant in Q1 to 2 (or lower).\n- Characterize the tight asymptotics of sup_\u03c0 Reg_log(\u03c0)/MST_log(\u03c0). The k-block construction suggests \u0398(log n) is tight; a matching upper bound would be interesting.\n- Explore whether analogous domination holds for other concave weightings w(d) (e.g., log^\u03b1(1+d) or min{d, log(1+d)}), where the same \"value-chain spanning tree\" method might extend with adjusted constants."
