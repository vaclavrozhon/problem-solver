# Ideas

- Prove a one-sided domination MST_log(π) ≤ C · Reg_log(π) by explicitly building a spanning tree whose total log-weight is bounded by the regional sum.
- Disprove the other direction by an explicit interleaving family with Θ(n) MST_log but Θ(n log n) Reg_log, giving an Ω(log n) separation.

# A convenient spanning tree: connect consecutive values

Work with the L1 norm (all norms differ by constants, absorbed in final constants). For each v=1,…,n−1, let i_v be the unique index with π(i_v)=v and add the edge

E_v: between p_{i_v} and p_{i_{v+1}}.

The set {E_v : v=1,…,n−1} is a spanning tree (a path along value order). Its total weight upper-bounds MST_log(π).

For each v, set s_v = |i_{v+1} − i_v|. Under L1,

w(E_v) = log(1 + (s_v + 1)) = log(2 + s_v) ≤ log 2 + log(1 + s_v).

Let i^* = max(i_v, i_{v+1}) be the later arrival time of the pair {v, v+1}. When the later one arrives, its most recent true neighbor-in-value is exactly the other endpoint of E_v, hence t_{i^*} = s_v. Since r_{i^*} ≥ t_{i^*}, we get

w(E_v) ≤ log 2 + log(1 + r_{i^*}).

Summing over v and grouping by times i^*, note that each time i contributes to at most two edges (neighbors ±1), so

∑_{v=1}^{n-1} w(E_v) ≤ (n−1) log 2 + 2 ∑_{i=2}^n log(1 + r_i)
= (n−1) log 2 + 2 · Reg_log(π).

Since for all i≥2, d_i ≥ 1 and t_i ≥ 1, we have r_i ≥ 2 and thus log(1 + r_i) ≥ log 3. Therefore Reg_log(π) ≥ (n−1) log 3. Absorbing the additive term yields the clean multiplicative bound

MST_log(π) ≤ (2 + log 2 / log 3) · Reg_log(π) < 2.631 · Reg_log(π).

In particular, MST_log(π) ≤ C_1 · Reg_log(π) with a universal constant C_1 (e.g., C_1 = 3) for any fixed norm and log base.

# Separation showing MST does not dominate Reg

Define, for even n,

π(2m−1) = m   and   π(2m) = n/2 + m,  for m = 1,…,n/2.

- MST_log upper bound: Connect odd-index points p_{2m−1} to p_{2m+1} (x-gap 2, y-gap 1) and even-index points p_{2m} to p_{2m+2} (x-gap 2, y-gap 1), plus one bridge between the two chains (say p_1 and p_2). Each intra-chain edge has constant log-weight; the bridge costs O(log n). Hence MST_log(π) = Θ(n).

- Reg_log lower bound: For i=2m−1 ≥ 3, previous π(i−1)=n/2 + (m−1). Among earlier indices, exactly m−2 even-valued elements lie strictly between; so d_{2m−1} = 1 + (m−2) = m−1. The most recent true neighbor of value m is m−1 at index 2m−3, so t_{2m−1} = 2. Thus r_{2m−1} = m+1. For i=2m ≥ 2, similarly d_{2m} = m, t_{2m} = 2, hence r_{2m} = m+2. Therefore

Reg_log(π) = ∑_{m=1}^{n/2} [log(1 + r_{2m−1}) + log(1 + r_{2m})] = Θ(n log n).

Thus Reg_log(π)/MST_log(π) = Θ(log n) → ∞. No constant C_2 can satisfy Reg_log ≤ C_2 · MST_log for all permutations.

# Conclusions

- Q1 (Does Reg dominate MST?): Yes. For all π,

  MST_log(π) ≤ (2 + log 2 / log 3) · Reg_log(π) < 2.631 · Reg_log(π).

  In particular, MST_log(π) ≤ 3 · Reg_log(π) suffices universally (any norm/log base).

- Q2 (Does MST dominate Reg?): No. The alternating-halves family above has Reg_log(π) = Θ(n log n) while MST_log(π) = Θ(n), so Reg/MST diverges.

- Q3 (Separation): The same family yields Reg_log/MST_log = Θ(log n) → ∞. Moreover, k-block round-robin interleavings (partition values into k contiguous blocks and interleave indices cyclically across blocks) give Reg_log/MST_log ≳ log(n/k), interpolating between Θ(n) and Θ(n log n) regimes while keeping MST_log = Θ(n) + O(k log n).

# Obstacles / Notes

- Tightening the constant in Q1: The double-counting by at most 2 is the bottleneck. A refined charging that bounds the longer neighbor edge at time i via d_i + t_i (instead of t_i alone) could potentially reduce the constant.
- The L1 choice made the per-edge inequality exact; other norms introduce only constant-factor additive terms inside the logarithm, absorbed in the final universal constant.

# Next steps

- Attempt to bound, for steps where both neighbors are present, the longer index-gap s_long by O(d_i + t_i), to improve the constant in Q1 to 2 (or lower).
- Characterize the tight asymptotics of sup_π Reg_log(π)/MST_log(π). The k-block construction suggests Θ(log n) is tight; a matching upper bound would be interesting.
- Explore whether analogous domination holds for other concave weightings w(d) (e.g., log^α(1+d) or min{d, log(1+d)}), where the same "value-chain spanning tree" method might extend with adjusted constants.
