  "content": "# Ideas\n- Work in L\u221e (max) norm; other norms are within constant factors: for any norm N there is \u03ba\u22651 with \\|z\\|_\u221e \u2264 \\|z\\|_N \u2264 \u03ba\\|z\\|_\u221e, hence log(1+\\|z\\|_N) \u2264 log(1+\u03ba)+log(1+\\|z\\|_\u221e). Additive O(n) over n\u22121 edges can be absorbed by Reg_{log}(\u03c0)=\u03a9(n).\n- Key auxiliary quantities: for v\u2208{1,\u2026,n\u22121}, let pos[v] be the unique index i with \u03c0(i)=v, and set s_v=|pos[v+1]\u2212pos[v]|.\n- Build two explicit spanning trees whose costs can be related to Reg_{log}: (a) the value-adjacency path connecting pos[v] to pos[v+1]; (b) a time-indexed parent choice j(i)<i: connect i to the most recent earlier value-neighbor (|\u0394\u03c0|=1) if it exists; otherwise connect to i\u22121.\n\n# Lemmas and Proof Sketches\nLemma 1 (Value-adjacency path upper-bounds MST in L\u221e).\nLet T_val contain edges {pos[v],pos[v+1]}, v=1,\u2026,n\u22121. Each edge has L\u221e-length max{s_v,1}=s_v, so w(e)=log(1+s_v). Hence\nMST_{log}(\u03c0;L\u221e) \u2264 \u2211_{v=1}^{n\u22121} log(1+s_v).\n\nLemma 2 (A low-cost time-parent tree).\nDefine for each i\u22652:\n- If \u2203 j<i with |\u03c0(i)\u2212\u03c0(j)|=1, set parent j(i) to be the largest such j. Then the L\u221e-distance is t_i, so contributes \u2264log(1+t_i) \u2264 log(1+r_i).\n- Otherwise (no earlier value-neighbor), set j(i)=i\u22121. Then the L\u221e-distance equals |\u03c0(i)\u2212\u03c0(i\u22121)| \u2264 n\u22121, so contributes \u2264log n.\nThis directed parent choice gives a connected, acyclic undirected graph (every edge points to a smaller index, so all paths end at 1), i.e., a spanning tree T_par. Let N be indices i with an earlier value-neighbor, and M its complement. Then\nCost(T_par) \u2264 \u2211_{i\u2208N} log(1+r_i) + \u2211_{i\u2208M} log n.\nSplit M into M_small={i\u2208M: i\u2264\u221an} and M_large=M\\M_small. Then\n- \u2211_{i\u2208M_large} log n \u2264 \u2211_{i\u2208M_large} 2 log i \u2264 2\u2211_{i\u2208M_large} log(1+r_i) (since r_i=i in M).\n- \u2211_{i\u2208M_small} log n \u2264 |M_small|\u00b7log n \u2264 \u221an\u00b7log n \u2264 n \u2264 (1/log 3)\u00b7Reg_{log}(\u03c0).\nTherefore, for L\u221e,\nMST_{log}(\u03c0) \u2264 Cost(T_par) \u2264 C\u00b7Reg_{log}(\u03c0) for some universal C (e.g., C=1+2+1/log 3<5).\nBy norm equivalence, the same multiplicative bound holds for any fixed norm (constants adjust by \u03ba and are still universal).\n\nConclusion 1 (Reg dominates MST).\nThere exists an absolute C_1 such that for all n and \u03c0,\nMST_{log}(\u03c0) \u2264 C_1\u00b7Reg_{log}(\u03c0).\n\n# Separation (MST does not dominate Reg)\nFamily: odd-first, even-next. Let n=2m and define \u03c0 by \u03c0(i)=2i\u22121 for 1\u2264i\u2264m, and \u03c0(i)=2(i\u2212m) for m<i\u22642m.\n- MST_{log}: In L\u221e, connect increasing chains within each half: each edge has length 2 (weight log 3), and bridge the halves with one edge of length n\u22123 (weight log(n\u22122)). Hence\nMST_{log}(\u03c0)= (n\u22122)\u00b7log 3 + log(n\u22122) = \u0398(n).\n- Reg_{log}: For 2\u2264i\u2264m, no earlier value-neighbor, so r_i=i and \u2211_{i=2}^m log(1+r_i)=\u0398(m log m). For m<i\u22642m, exactly one value-neighbor is earlier (in the odd half), with t_i\u2248i\u2212\u0398(m) and d_i=2 (one odd lies between successive evens), so r_i= min(d_i+t_i,i)=\u0398(i\u2212m). Thus \u2211_{i=m+1}^{2m} log(1+r_i)=\u0398(m log m). Total Reg_{log}(\u03c0)=\u0398(n log n).\nTherefore Reg_{log}(\u03c0)/MST_{log}(\u03c0)=\u0398(log n)\u2192\u221e. Hence there is no constant C_2 with Reg_{log}(\u03c0) \u2264 C_2\u00b7MST_{log}(\u03c0) for all \u03c0.\n\nConclusion 2 (Separation for the reverse inequality).\nThere is an infinite family {\u03c0_n} (odd-first, even-next) with Reg_{log}(\u03c0_n)/MST_{log}(\u03c0_n)\u2192\u221e. Thus MST does not dominate Reg.\n\n# Obstacles and Notes\n- Tight constants in Lemma 2 can likely be improved. The \u221an\u00b7log n additive term is absorbed by Reg_{log}(\u03c0)=\u03a9(n), but a direct per-term domination for all i\u2208M may be possible with a refined parent choice.\n- It remains open whether a sharper two-sided comparison holds up to polylog(n) factors, e.g., Reg_{log}(\u03c0) \u2264 O(log n)\u00b7MST_{log}(\u03c0) for all \u03c0.\n\n# Next steps\n- Optimize the parent-choice construction to remove the \u221an\u00b7log n additive slack and tighten C_1.\n- Investigate upper bounds Reg_{log}(\u03c0) \u2264 O(log n)\u00b7MST_{log}(\u03c0) or exhibit families with Reg/MST\u2248\u0398(log n) proving tightness.\n- Explore alternative regional radii definitions aligning exactly with the value-adjacency path cost \u2211_v log(1+s_v), potentially yielding cleaner equivalences."
