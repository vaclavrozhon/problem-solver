# Ideas
- Work in L∞ (max) norm; other norms are within constant factors: for any norm N there is κ≥1 with \|z\|_∞ ≤ \|z\|_N ≤ κ\|z\|_∞, hence log(1+\|z\|_N) ≤ log(1+κ)+log(1+\|z\|_∞). Additive O(n) over n−1 edges can be absorbed by Reg_{log}(π)=Ω(n).
- Key auxiliary quantities: for v∈{1,…,n−1}, let pos[v] be the unique index i with π(i)=v, and set s_v=|pos[v+1]−pos[v]|.
- Build two explicit spanning trees whose costs can be related to Reg_{log}: (a) the value-adjacency path connecting pos[v] to pos[v+1]; (b) a time-indexed parent choice j(i)<i: connect i to the most recent earlier value-neighbor (|Δπ|=1) if it exists; otherwise connect to i−1.

# Lemmas and Proof Sketches
Lemma 1 (Value-adjacency path upper-bounds MST in L∞).
Let T_val contain edges {pos[v],pos[v+1]}, v=1,…,n−1. Each edge has L∞-length max{s_v,1}=s_v, so w(e)=log(1+s_v). Hence
MST_{log}(π;L∞) ≤ ∑_{v=1}^{n−1} log(1+s_v).

Lemma 2 (A low-cost time-parent tree).
Define for each i≥2:
- If ∃ j<i with |π(i)−π(j)|=1, set parent j(i) to be the largest such j. Then the L∞-distance is t_i, so contributes ≤log(1+t_i) ≤ log(1+r_i).
- Otherwise (no earlier value-neighbor), set j(i)=i−1. Then the L∞-distance equals |π(i)−π(i−1)| ≤ n−1, so contributes ≤log n.
This directed parent choice gives a connected, acyclic undirected graph (every edge points to a smaller index, so all paths end at 1), i.e., a spanning tree T_par. Let N be indices i with an earlier value-neighbor, and M its complement. Then
Cost(T_par) ≤ ∑_{i∈N} log(1+r_i) + ∑_{i∈M} log n.
Split M into M_small={i∈M: i≤√n} and M_large=M\M_small. Then
- ∑_{i∈M_large} log n ≤ ∑_{i∈M_large} 2 log i ≤ 2∑_{i∈M_large} log(1+r_i) (since r_i=i in M).
- ∑_{i∈M_small} log n ≤ |M_small|·log n ≤ √n·log n ≤ n ≤ (1/log 3)·Reg_{log}(π).
Therefore, for L∞,
MST_{log}(π) ≤ Cost(T_par) ≤ C·Reg_{log}(π) for some universal C (e.g., C=1+2+1/log 3<5).
By norm equivalence, the same multiplicative bound holds for any fixed norm (constants adjust by κ and are still universal).

Conclusion 1 (Reg dominates MST).
There exists an absolute C_1 such that for all n and π,
MST_{log}(π) ≤ C_1·Reg_{log}(π).

# Separation (MST does not dominate Reg)
Family: odd-first, even-next. Let n=2m and define π by π(i)=2i−1 for 1≤i≤m, and π(i)=2(i−m) for m<i≤2m.
- MST_{log}: In L∞, connect increasing chains within each half: each edge has length 2 (weight log 3), and bridge the halves with one edge of length n−3 (weight log(n−2)). Hence
MST_{log}(π)= (n−2)·log 3 + log(n−2) = Θ(n).
- Reg_{log}: For 2≤i≤m, no earlier value-neighbor, so r_i=i and ∑_{i=2}^m log(1+r_i)=Θ(m log m). For m<i≤2m, exactly one value-neighbor is earlier (in the odd half), with t_i≈i−Θ(m) and d_i=2 (one odd lies between successive evens), so r_i= min(d_i+t_i,i)=Θ(i−m). Thus ∑_{i=m+1}^{2m} log(1+r_i)=Θ(m log m). Total Reg_{log}(π)=Θ(n log n).
Therefore Reg_{log}(π)/MST_{log}(π)=Θ(log n)→∞. Hence there is no constant C_2 with Reg_{log}(π) ≤ C_2·MST_{log}(π) for all π.

Conclusion 2 (Separation for the reverse inequality).
There is an infinite family {π_n} (odd-first, even-next) with Reg_{log}(π_n)/MST_{log}(π_n)→∞. Thus MST does not dominate Reg.

# Obstacles and Notes
- Tight constants in Lemma 2 can likely be improved. The √n·log n additive term is absorbed by Reg_{log}(π)=Ω(n), but a direct per-term domination for all i∈M may be possible with a refined parent choice.
- It remains open whether a sharper two-sided comparison holds up to polylog(n) factors, e.g., Reg_{log}(π) ≤ O(log n)·MST_{log}(π) for all π.

# Next steps
- Optimize the parent-choice construction to remove the √n·log n additive slack and tighten C_1.
- Investigate upper bounds Reg_{log}(π) ≤ O(log n)·MST_{log}(π) or exhibit families with Reg/MST≈Θ(log n) proving tightness.
- Explore alternative regional radii definitions aligning exactly with the value-adjacency path cost ∑_v log(1+s_v), potentially yielding cleaner equivalences.
