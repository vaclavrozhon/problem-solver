We proved a one-sided domination and a separation. Using Kruskal’s integral identity and a sparse threshold graph H(t) (attaching time- and recent-value edges), for the L∞ norm we get MST_log(π) ≤ Reg_log(π). Lifting to any fixed norm gives MST_log^N(π) ≤ C_N·Reg_log(π) for a constant C_N. Conversely, residue-class (mod-m) permutations (in particular parity blocks) give MST_log(π)=Θ(n) but Reg_log(π)=Θ(n log n), so Reg_log(π)/MST_log(π)=Θ(log n); hence no universal reverse domination. A previous direct charging attempt had a gap; the component-integral method fixes it.
