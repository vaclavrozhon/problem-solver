{"summary_md":"We proved a one-sided domination and a separation. Using Kruskal’s integral identity and a sparse threshold graph H(t) (attaching time- and recent-value edges), for the L∞ norm we get MST_log(π) ≤ Reg_log(π). Lifting to any fixed norm gives MST_log^N(π) ≤ C_N·Reg_log(π) for a constant C_N. Conversely, residue-class (mod-m) permutations (in particular parity blocks) give MST_log(π)=Θ(n) but Reg_log(π)=Θ(n log n), so Reg_log(π)/MST_log(π)=Θ(log n); hence no universal reverse domination. A previous direct charging attempt had a gap; the component-integral method fixes it.","highlights":["Kruskal-integral identity: MST_log(L∞)=∫_0^∞(κ(t)−1)dt/(1+t) and the sparse H(t) yields MST_log(L∞) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+min(Δ_i,t_i)) ≤ Reg_log(π).","Norm invariance: for any fixed norm N there is C_N with MST_log^N(π) ≤ C_N·Reg_log(π) (constant from operator-norm bound).","Separation: ordering values by residue classes mod m gives MST_log(π)=Θ(n) but Reg_log(π)=Θ(n log(n/m)); for constant m (e.g. parity) this is Θ(n log n), so ratio Θ(log n).","Trivial lower bound: MST_log(π) ≥ (n−1)log 2, and Reg_log(π)=Θ(n log n) for random π by design."],"next_questions":["Prove or disprove a matching upper bound Reg_log(π) ≤ O(log n)·MST_log(π) for all π (is Θ(log n) the worst-case factor?).","Tighten/compute constants C_N for common norms (L1,L2) and quantify leading constants/expectations E[MST_log], E[Reg_log] for random π." , "Search for permutations with separation larger than Θ(log n) or prove impossibility." ]}
