Since logs are monotone, Kruskal's method sorts edges by weight, maintaining the same order. This allows for the same MST structure when transforming edge weights as long as it's strictly increasing. Even when I add a constant inside the log, it remains monotonic. So, while the sum of log weights varies from sum of distances, the MST remains unchanged.\n\n**Analyzing MST and log properties**\n\nI\u2019m looking into studying the minimum spanning tree (MST) in a metric context, specifically summing logs of edge lengths. It seems a little complicated but still doable. I realize bounding the log of the MST reduces to the sum of logs of the lengths of edges in the standard MST. Also, the Euclidean MST on a grid is planar, with a maximum degree of 6. When considering edge lengths, most are O(1), leading to an O(n) sum of logs. But, long edges could complicate things since they would add more to the log sum.\n\n**Examining nearest neighbor distances**\n\nI\u2019m considering points arranged along a permutation and connecting nearest neighbors based on geometric closeness. The L_infinity nearest neighbor distance could be O(1), considering the direct horizontal adjacency. However, the vertical differences can vary significantly, possibly reaching up to n. When connecting two points, the edge length could be as large as \u0398(n), but the MST can opt for closer connections instead. Since this is a permutation, I find that the typical nearest neighbor distance is often around O(sqrt(n)).\n\n**Analyzing random permutation distances**\n\nI\u2019m thinking that for a random permutation, the expected minimal L_\u221e distance between points could be O(1). In a grid, the vertical distances for adjacent points seem to have a uniform distribution, and the chance that differences between any two points are small diminishes like 2/n. While I know the MST for Euclidean lengths typically sums to O(n), I\u2019m looking at random points in a unit square. After scaling, the expected Euclidean MST length might still be around \u0398(\u221an), similar to i.i.d. uniform distributions, which scale as c\u221an in 2D.\n\n**Exploring MST and Reg_log relationships**\n\nI'm analyzing the Euclidean norm and how it affects distances in the MST and Reg_log. It looks like both are bounded between linear and n log n, but I wonder if they track each other consistently. There might be scenarios where one is \u0398(n) and the other \u0398(n log n). As I consider random permutations, it seems the MST could use edges with L\u221e length around \u221an to connect all points. Then, summing logs of edge lengths might lead to MST_log being \u0398(n log n), matching Reg_log. I'm curious about worst-case separation scenarios to see if MST_log might be smaller while Reg_log is larger.\n\n**Examining the relationships between MST_log and Reg_log**\n\nTo show if one dominates the other, like MST_log \u2264 constant times Reg_log, I realize we need to create examples where their ratios diverge significantly. If I can make Reg_log small, especially when value neighbors are close together, it leads to lower values. Variations on the zigzag or monotonic paths could keep both t_i and d_i small, keeping Reg_log linear. However, making Reg_log large near n log n requires creating larger gaps in the value neighbors. I should explore specific arrangements, possibly embedding permutations along a path with consistent distances, while manipulating the arrangement of values to increase t_i.\n\n**Exploring MST and Reg arrangements**\n\nI\u2019m realizing that t_i depends on the sequence \u03c0 along the index i, but \u03c0 values are tied to their geometric positions. If I arrange the points so that adjacent entries in i are geometrically far apart but still allow for close connections in terms of values, it could help minimize the MST cost. So, if I create clusters of points positioned tightly together while keeping them spread out in sequence, they may yield a low-cost MST yet still have high Reg costs due to large jumps in value ordering. Balancing these could lead to interesting configurations!\n\n**Designing permutation properties**\n\nI\u2019m considering local properties in the permutation graph, specifically bounded square adjacency which implies nearby values should exist in the permutation. However, merely having nearby indices doesn\u2019t ensure small t_i, as they might not represent actual neighbors in terms of values. My goal is to create permutations with a \"mesh property,\" ensuring for every index, there are close pairs to support MST connections while making sure Reg remains large. To do this, I can define relationships across blocks of constant slope while controlling distances cleverly. It\u2019s a complex balancing act!\n\n**Exploring neighbor dynamics**\n\nI realize d_i can be at most a constant if |\u0394y| stays within a limit, C. The maximum number of integers between previous values can\u2019t exceed C-1. So, when dealing with t_i, which measures the time since the last neighbor appeared, I\u2019m aiming to design permutations to maintain small movements while minimizing encounters with immediate neighbors. This involves balancing various values in a sequence and ensuring that neither neighbor appears too soon to keep time increments considerable. It\u2019s a complex interplay of values, neighbors, and constraints!\n\n**Examining value separations**\n\nI'm analyzing the pairing dynamics of adjacent values (v, v+1). For each pair, there's a specific index where a neighbor is first encountered, contributing a measure of time separation, t. The aim is to balance these with the arrangement of values to minimize direct neighbor encounters while maintaining a bounded difference in their values. Keeping step differences small and avoiding frequent neighbor-of-value occurrences is key, though tricky. I\u2019m thinking about how to interleave classes effectively to manage their differences cleverly!\n\n**Designing neighbor separation**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to structure the residue classes to maintain a balance. The idea is to ensure that neighbors-of-value remain distant in time while keeping the differences small, specifically within a constant range. By organizing each class and ensuring that bridges between classes maintain a step difference that\u2019s greater than one, I can reduce neighbor adjacency. However, I realize that if I keep  neighboring values within the same row, they might still be too close. Maybe partitioning the values into odd and even sets would help with separation!\n\n**Analyzing sequence and MST**\n\nIn the even numbers (set A), I can arrange them to step by 2, meaning the differences are small within this segment, while the jump to the first odd (set B) creates a large gap. This large boundary jump shouldn't affect the minimum spanning tree (MST) because nearby pairs aren't necessarily forced together. If the edges remain small, the weight of the MST can be kept low, leading to a situation where the logarithmic weight is O(n), which is promising! Now, I need to figure out how to handle the regularity (Reg) to keep it larger.\n\n**Examining segments and performance**\n\nI'm considering the end of the evens segment, where the last even value and its neighboring odd values influence their distances. When processing odd values, the distance to the previous neighbor initially is small but grows as more odd numbers are processed. However, previous even numbers keep appearing multiple times in various indices.\n\nFor the regularity (Reg), the distances within the odd segments mean I calculate contributions leading to a total of \u0398(n log n), while the minimum spanning tree (MST) remains around O(n). This suggests that MST does not dominate Reg despite being smaller! I need to confirm that MST stays bounded by Reg.\n\n**Analyzing MST and Reg relationships**\n\nI'm exploring how the minimum spanning tree (MST) weights relate to regularity (Reg) through examining paths and counting values. To argue that MST can't dominate Reg, I'm relating their weights and looking for connections between \u0394y and counts like r_{i+1}. The challenge arises when \u0394y is large but we've not seen intermediate values, affecting our attempts to bound r from below. I find that while I can show MST does not dominate Reg, I must also prove Reg isn't larger than MST, requiring careful construction of sequences. Overall, I need to establish concrete bounds and relationships.\n\n**Exploring MST neighbor connections**\n\nI\u2019m assessing how frequently points in the sequence visit nearby neighbors, which affects their closeness in geometry. While time order allows distances to be far in index, small value differences can still create helpful connections. By ensuring that many points have nearby neighbors, I can find small edges for the minimal spanning tree (MST). My goal is to show that the weight of this MST relates to regularity (Reg) and that MST can be bounded by specific logarithmic sums. This leads to constructing a directed tree that avoids cycles and confirms its connectivity.\n\n**Analyzing graph connections**\n\nI\u2019m considering the structure of the graph and confirming that it is indeed a connected directed arborescence with root at p_1. Now, I need to find the weight of an edge connecting nodes (i, j), where j is the nearest y-value to \u03c0(i). The concept of \"gap\" arises when looking for the closest neighbor and relates to the distance between values. I want to show how gap_i connects to the costs of a balanced binary search tree and bounds the edges efficiently, though it might be challenging to manage large absolute differences in y-values.\n\n**Exploring graph weights**\n\nI\u2019m examining how to ensure that the weight in this graph uses a geometric norm, particularly relating to the distances between points. I want to show that the total weight of connections in my structure can be bounded by a sum involving gaps between values. By connecting each node to the nearest earlier node, I ensure acyclicity while also maintaining connectivity. I also aim to keep the weight controlled, linking it to logarithmic growth, which helps in analyzing the structure further and proving its properties.\n\n**Analyzing edge connections**\n\nI'm considering how to maintain connectivity in my graph. When no previous neighbor exists, I can always connect to the immediate prior node. This keeps all paths directed towards node 1. If a neighbor exists, I can utilize that too\u2014both scenarios ensure that each node connects back to an earlier node. I want to examine weight calculations based on the distances and ensure that I can derive upper bounds related to my graph's structure while avoiding any confusing reductions between distance measures.\n\n**Bounding tree weights**\n\nI'm working on bounding the weights in my graph. If \\( r_i = i \\), I've figured out that I can relate the weights of edges to the log of the minimum distances. It's good that I've established a clear upper bound for the minimum spanning tree (MST) in terms of a regularity measure, denoted \\( Reg \\). We need to ensure this reasoning is sound and that I can confidently express these weight bounds and structure as a valid lemma. It looks like everything checks out, but I need to confirm all aspects are aligned, especially concerning the distances and norms.\n\n**Analyzing logarithmic bounds**\n\nI\u2019m checking my bounds on the logarithmic relationships; it seems I can confirm that \\( \\log(2 + x) \\) is less than or equal to \\( \\log 3 + \\log(1 + x) \\). I\u2019m exploring case scenarios for dealing with odd and even values, how they affect the computations for \\( r_i \\), and ensuring my definitions for those relationships hold up under scrutiny. The goal is to establish a clear, consistent upper bound alongside verifying the lower bounds for different cases where \\( MST_{\\log} \\) behaves comparably to \\( Reg_{\\log} \\) in logarithmic growth, especially within random permutations.\n\n**Working through log bounds**\n\nI'm combining sums for elements in both the even and odd segments. I see that for \\( i \\) in even segments, I get some approximations that suggest \\( Reg_{\\log} \\) is about \\( n \\log n - O(n) \\). When looking at upper bounds for \\( MST_{\\log} \\), it connects nicely to simplicity in adjacency, showing that both \\( MST_{\\log} \\) and \\( Reg_{\\log} \\) can grow similar, hinting at a ratio close to \\( \\Theta(\\log n) \\). I\u2019ll need to formalize my findings from my previous proofs, ensuring clarity in the connections and structure.\n\n**Analyzing log weights**\n\nI\u2019m establishing that the weight per edge is always at least \\( \\log 2 \\) across any norm, and I see how this plays into general lower bounds. For \\( Reg_{\\log} \\), I\u2019m summing to find an upper bound of roughly \\( n \\log n \\) and a lower bound of \\( (n - 1) \\log 2 \\). It\u2019s crucial now to demonstrate that \\( MST_{\\log} \\) is linear \\( O(n) \\). I'll present explicit calculations and connect this to different properties of the path structure, ensuring everything is rigorously proven.\n\n**Structuring the analysis**\n\nI need to focus on comparing \\( Reg \\) with the elements of early blocks, where \\( t_i \\) has no previous neighbors of value. In the first block of classes, I see that \\( t_i = i - 1 \\) and \\( d_i = 1 \\), yielding a sum that approximates \\( (n/k) \\log(n/k) \\). For later blocks, \\( t_i \\) relates to previous elements, but there\u2019s a key insight about processing the classes sequentially.\n\nThe exploration of boundary jumps and weight contributions shows \\( O(k \\log n) \\) remains overshadowed by \\( O(n) \\). I\u2019ll confirm the exact differences and propose general families that yield the needed results! It's also clear that I need to present clear lemmas and propositions to succinctly express these relationships while adhering to formatting guidelines.\n\n**Compiling asymptotic dominance insights**\n\nI need to establish that for any permutation \\( \\pi \\) and norm \\( \\| \\cdot \\| \\), the relationships hold across both \\( MST \\) and \\( Reg \\). Specifically, I'll show \\( MST_{log}(\\pi) \\) is bounded by a constant times \\( Reg_{log}(\\pi) \\). \n\nIn constructing examples, I'll explore a family defined by evens then odds, where I compute \\( MST_{log} \\approx \\Theta(n) \\) and \\( Reg_{log} \\) significantly growing with lower bound around \\( \\Omega(n \\log n) \\). \n\nI must ensure to include clear logical steps, rigorous proofs, and additional insights about the constants\u2019 interactions and bounds. I'll summarize everything nicely!\n\n**Summarizing worst-case scenarios**\n\nI'm proposing that the worst-case gap is \\( \\Theta(\\log n) \\) with constant normative independence. Proving this is relatively straightforward. I also established that the supremum of \\( MST/Reg \\) is \\( O(1) \\), as indicated in Theorem Q1, meaning there can't be separation in that direction. So, separation fails in either inequality. \n\nIt's crucial to note \"norm invariance\"; the constants may change, but the asymptotic behavior remains unaffected. Now, I\u2019ll summarize all main results in a structured JSON format containing the appropriate content!\n\n{\n  \"content\": \"# Ideas and Executive Summary\\n\\n- We construct an explicit spanning tree whose total log-weight is controlled by the regional radii r_i. This yields a uniform upper bound MST_log(\u03c0) \u2264 \u03b1 \u00b7 Reg_log(\u03c0) for a universal constant \u03b1. Thus Reg dominates MST up to constants (answers Q1 in the affirmative).\\n- We exhibit a simple family (evens-then-odds) for which Reg_log(\u03c0) = \u0398(n log n) but MST_log(\u03c0) = \u0398(n), so Reg/MST = \u0398(log n) \u2192 \u221e. Hence MST does not dominate Reg (answers Q2 in the negative, and gives separation for Q3).\\n- Both measures always lie between \u0398(n) and \u0398(n log n).

Upper bound on MST_log: the diameter of P_\u03c0 in any fixed norm is O(n), so each of the n\u22121 edges in any spanning tree has log-weight at most log(1+O(n)), yielding O(n log n). Lower bound: in L_\u221e, any two distinct points have distance \u2265 1, so every MST edge has log-weight \u2265 log 2, giving \u03a9(n).

There is a universal constant \u03b1 such that for all n and all \u03c0,\\n  MST_log(\u03c0) \u2264 \u03b1 \u00b7 Reg_log(\u03c0).\\nOne can take for example \u03b1 = 1 + (log 3)/(log 2) (for any fixed choice of norm and log base), hence \u03b1 is an absolute constant.\\n\\nProof. Work with the L1 norm (other norms differ by constant factors; see the remark at the end). For each i \u2265 2, define two candidate edges from p_i to a strictly earlier vertex:\\n- the previous-by-time edge to p_{i\u22121}, of L1-length 1 + |\u03c0(i) \u2212 \u03c0(i\u22121)|,\\n- if it exists, the \\\"most recent true neighbor in value\\\" edge to the largest j < i with |\u03c0(i) \u2212 \u03c0(j)| = 1, which has L1-length 1 + t_i by definition of t_i.\\n\\nConstruct a directed spanning arborescence by, for each i \u2265 2, connecting p_i to whichever of those two candidates yields the smaller L1-distance (if no true neighbor exists, choose p_{i\u22121}). Each edge goes to a smaller index, so no directed cycles occur, and there are exactly n\u22121 edges; undirected, this is a spanning tree T*. Its log-weight bounds the MST log-weight from above.\\n\\nFor each i \u2265 2, let \u0394_i = |\u03c0(i) \u2212 \u03c0(i\u22121)| and recall t_i.

This proves Q1 affirmatively.\\n\\n\\n# Separation: MST does not dominate Reg\\n\\nWe give a family with Reg/MST \u224d log n.\\n\\nExample 2 (Evens-then-odds). Let n = 2m and define\\n  \u03c0(i) = 2i for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m (the evens in order), and \u03c0(m + k) = 2k \u2212 1 for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 m (then the odds in order).\\n\\n1) Bounding MST_log from above. Consider the path on indices 1,2,\u2026,n. For 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m\u22121, |\u03c0(i+1) \u2212 \u03c0(i)| = 2, and for m+1 \u2264 i \u2264 n\u22121, |\u03c0(i+1) \u2212 \u03c0(i)| = 2. The single boundary step i=m has |\u03c0(m+1) \u2212 \u03c0(m)| = 2m\u22121 = \u0398(n). In L1, the path edges have lengths 3 except one edge of length 2m. Hence the path\u2019s total log-weight is\\n  (n\u22122)\u00b7log(1+3) + log(1+2m) = \u0398(n).\\nTherefore MST_log(\u03c0) = O(n). Since every MST has n\u22121 edges of weight at least a positive constant, MST_log(\u03c0) = \u0398(n).\\n\\n2) Computing Reg_log. For 2 \u2264 i \u2264 m, all true neighbors of \u03c0(i) are odd and unseen, so t_i = i\u22121 and d_i = 1 (no prior values lie between two consecutive evens). Thus r_i = i and\\n  \u2211_{i=2}^m log(1 + r_i) = \u2211_{i=2}^m log(1+i) = \u0398(m log m).\\nAt i = m+1, we jump from 2m to 1. The interval (1,2m) contains m\u22121 previously seen evens, so d_{m+1} = m, while the most recent true neighbor is 2 at time m, so t_{m+1} = 1, giving r_{m+1} = m+1 and a contribution of log(1+m+1).\\nFor m+2 \u2264 i \u2264 2m, successive odds differ by 2, so among prior values exactly one even lies between them; hence d_i = 2. Their most recent true neighbor among the evens appears at time \u2264 m, so t_i = m. Then r_i = min(d_i + t_i, i) = m+2 for all these i. Thus these m\u22121 terms contribute (m\u22121)\u00b7log(1+m+2) = \u0398(m log m).\\nAdding the three parts gives Reg_log(\u03c0) = \u0398(m log m) = \u0398(n log n).\\n\\nConclusion. For this family, Reg_log/MST_log = \u0398(log n) \u2192 \u221e. Hence there is no universal C with Reg_log(\u03c0) \u2264 C \u00b7 MST_log(\u03c0) for all \u03c0.

For any two norms \u2016\u00b7\u2016 and \u2016\u00b7\u2016\u2032 on R^2 there exist constants a,b>0 with a\u2016x\u2016\u2032 \u2264 \u2016x\u2016 \u2264 b\u2016x\u2016\u2032. Then log(1+\u2016x\u2016) \u2264 log(1+b\u2016x\u2016\u2032) \u2264 log(1+b) + log(1+\u2016x\u2016\u2032). Summing over n\u22121 edges changes the above bound by O(n), which is absorbed as above.\\n\\nConsequently, Reg dominates MST up to a universal constant. This proves Q1 affirmatively.\\n\\n\\n# Separation: MST does not dominate Reg\\n\\nWe give a family with Reg/MST \u224d log n.\\n\\nExample 2 (Evens-then-odds). Let n = 2m and define\\n  \u03c0(i) = 2i for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m (the evens in order), and \u03c0(m + k) = 2k \u2212 1 for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 m (then the odds in order).\\n\\n1) Bounding MST_log from above. Consider the path on indices 1,2,\u2026,n. For 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m\u22121, |\u03c0(i+1) \u2212 \u03c0(i)| = 2, and for m+1 \u2264 i \u2264 n\u22121, |\u03c0(i+1) \u2212 \u03c0(i)| = 2. The single boundary step i=m has |\u03c0(m+1) \u2212 \u03c0(m)| = 2m\u22121 = \u0398(n). In L1, the path edges have lengths 3 except one edge of length 2m. Hence the path\u2019s total log-weight is\\n  (n\u22122)\u00b7log(1+3) + log(1+2m) = \u0398(n).\\nTherefore MST_log(\u03c0) = O(n). Since every MST has n\u22121 edges of weight at least a positive constant, MST_log(\u03c0) = \u0398(n).\\n\\n2) Computing Reg_log. For 2 \u2264 i \u2264 m, all true neighbors of \u03c0(i) are odd and unseen, so t_i = i\u22121 and d_i = 1 (no prior values lie between two consecutive evens). Thus r_i = i and\\n  \u2211_{i=2}^m log(1 + r_i) = \u2211_{i=2}^m log(1+i) = \u0398(m log m).\\nAt i = m+1, we jump from 2m to 1. The interval (1,2m) contains m\u22121 previously seen evens, so d_{m+1} = m, while the most recent true neighbor is 2 at time m, so t_{m+1} = 1, giving r_{m+1} = m+1 and a contribution of log(1+m+1).\\nFor m+2 \u2264 i \u2264 2m, successive odds differ by 2, so among prior values exactly one even lies between them; hence d_i = 2. Their most recent true neighbor among the evens appears at time \u2264 m, so t_i = m. Then r_i = min(d_i + t_i, i) = m+2 for all these i. Thus these m\u22121 terms contribute (m\u22121)\u00b7log(1+m+2) = \u0398(m log m).\\nAdding the three parts gives Reg_log(\u03c0) = \u0398(m log m) = \u0398(n log n).\\n\\nConclusion. For this family, Reg_log/MST_log = \u0398(log n) \u2192 \u221e. Hence there is no universal C with Reg_log(\u03c0) \u2264 C \u00b7 MST_log(\u03c0) for all \u03c0. This answers Q2 negatively and furnishes the separation requested in Q3.\\n\\n\\n# Corollaries and Tightness\\n\\n- From Theorem 1, sup_\u03c0 MST_log(\u03c0)/Reg_log(\u03c0) = O(1).\\n- From Example 2 and Lemma A, sup_\u03c0 Reg_log(\u03c0)/MST_log(\u03c0) = \u0398(log n).\\nThus the largest possible multiplicative gap between the two measures is \u0398(log n), achieved by simple structured permutations; on random-like permutations both measures are typically \u0398(n log n).\\n\\n\\n# Obstacles and Checks\\n\\n- A naive attempt to compare MST_log directly to \u2211 log(1+d_i) fails because d_i can be much smaller than |\u03c0(i)\u2212\u03c0(i\u22121)| when few interval elements have appeared; however the two-edge construction (previous-by-time vs. most-recent-true-neighbor) bypasses this by always providing a cheap local connector controlled by d_i + t_i or by i.\\n- One might try to reverse the inequality (MST dominates Reg) by scattering points so that no short geometric edges exist; but then successive values typically take large jumps in both value-distance and time-to-neighbor, pushing Reg up to \u0398(n log n). Example 2 shows this reverse domination is false in general.\\n\\n\\n# Next Steps\\n\\n- Tighten constants in Theorem 1: the per-edge bound w_i \u2264 log 3 + log(1+r_i) could likely be sharpened by refining the choice of the \u201cfallback\u201d connector (e.g., also allowing the nearest previous-by-value among the prefix, not only the most recent true neighbor \u00b11 and the immediate predecessor).\\n- Explore whether refined variants of Reg (e.g., replacing d_i + t_i by a dynamic-finger-like gap to the closest previous in value among the prefix) are equivalent to MST_log up to constants; our proof suggests this is plausible.\\n- Quantify typical-case behavior of MST_log for random permutations rigorously (heuristics suggest \u0398(n log n) via nearest-neighbor scale r \u224d \u221an in L_\u221e), and locate constants.\\n\"\n}"
