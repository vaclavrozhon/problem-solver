We established a rigorous one-sided domination: for L∞, MST_log(π) ≤ Reg_log(π), and for any fixed norm, MST_log(π) ≤ C·Reg_log(π) for a universal C. The converse fails: residue-class (including parity) permutations have MST_log(π) = Θ(n) but Reg_log(π) = Θ(n log n), so Reg/MST = Θ(log n). Prover 2’s Kruskal-integral method is the clean proof for the domination; Prover 1’s earlier charging has a gap (t_{i*} ≠ s_v in general). Next focus: prove a universal upper bound Reg_log ≤ O(log n)·MST_log or show the Θ(log n) separation is tight.
