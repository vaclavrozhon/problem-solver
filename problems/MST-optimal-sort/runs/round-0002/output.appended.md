- One-sided domination: For L∞, MST_log(π) ≤ Reg_log(π) for all π. For any fixed norm N on R^2, MST_log^N(π) ≤ C_N·Reg_log(π) with a universal constant C_N.
- No reverse domination: There is no constant C such that Reg_log(π) ≤ C·MST_log(π) for all π. In particular, parity/mod-m block permutations satisfy MST_log(π)=Θ(n) while Reg_log(π)=Θ(n log n), so Reg_log/MST_log=Θ(log n).
