Ideas
- Tighten and audit the one-sided domination MST_log ≤ Reg_log via the Kruskal–integral identity in L∞ and extend to any fixed norm by norm-equivalence plus the trivial lower bound Reg_log ≥ (n−1)·log 2.
- Isolate the contribution of the “temporal” terms by a clean matching: ∑ log(1+t_i) ≤ ∑_v log(1+s_v), where s_v=|pos[v+1]−pos[v]|. This quantifies how t_i’s are absorbed by the value-adjacency path cost.
- Give a simple, universal upper bound Reg_log ≤ O(log n)·MST_log using only r_i ≤ i and the minimal per-edge weight in the MST. This matches the Θ(log n) lower bound family.

Setup and notation
- Work in L∞ first; other norms follow by constants. Let Δ_i = |π(i)−π(i−1)| for i≥2, so ||p_i−p_{i−1}||_∞ = Δ_i.
- For v∈{1,…,n−1}, let pos[v] be the index i with π(i)=v, and s_v = |pos[v+1]−pos[v]|.

Lemma 1 (Integral identity and MST_log ≤ Reg_log in L∞)
For the threshold graphs G(t) on P_π with edges of L∞-length ≤ t and κ(t)=#components in G(t),
MST_log(π;L∞) = ∫_0^∞ (κ(t)−1) dt/(1+t).
Proof sketch. If the MST edges have lengths {ℓ_e}, then log(1+ℓ_e)=∫_0^{ℓ_e} dt/(1+t). Summing and swapping integrals gives ∫_0^∞ #(e:ℓ_e>t) dt/(1+t). In Kruskal’s process at threshold t, G(t) has κ(t) components; exactly κ(t)−1 of the MST edges exceed t (those that will later merge these components). Hence the identity.

Construction for the upper bound. For each i≥2 and threshold t≥0, define a parent par_t(i) as follows:
- If Δ_i ≤ t, set par_t(i)=i−1.
- Else if there exists j<i with |π(i)−π(j)|=1 and i−j ≤ t (equivalently t_i ≤ t), set par_t(i)=j (the most recent such j suffices).
- Else leave i parentless.
Whenever par_t(i) is defined, the edge (i,par_t(i)) exists in G(t). The directed forest F(t) consisting of these parent edges has exactly 1+|{i≥2: Δ_i>t and t_i>t}| components (rooted at i with no parent, plus vertex 1). Since F(t) ⊆ G(t), κ(t) ≤ #components(F(t)) = 1+|{i≥2: Δ_i>t and t_i>t}|.
Integrate:
MST_log(π;L∞) ≤ ∫_0^∞ ∑_{i=2}^n 1[Δ_i>t and t_i>t] dt/(1+t) = ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+min{Δ_i,t_i}).
Finally, since r_i = min{d_i+t_i, i} ≥ min{Δ_i,t_i}, we conclude
MST_log(π;L∞) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+r_i) = Reg_log(π).

Lemma 2 (Norm extension)
Fix any norm ||·|| on R^2. There is a constant C(||·||) such that for all π,
MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ C(||·||)·Reg_log(π).
Proof. Choose κ≥1 with ||z|| ≤ κ||z||_∞. For an L∞-MST T_∞,
∑_{e∈T_∞} log(1+||e||) ≤ ∑_e log(1+κ||e||_∞) ≤ ∑_e log(1+||e||_∞) + (n−1)log(1+κ) = MST_log^{∞}(π) + (n−1)log(1+κ).
By Lemma 1, MST_log^{∞}(π) ≤ Reg_log(π). Also Reg_log(π) ≥ (n−1)·log 2 (since each term ≥ log 2). Hence
MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ [1 + log(1+κ)/log 2]·Reg_log(π).

Lemma 3 (Temporal-to-value matching)
Let I_val = {i∈{2,…,n}: ∃ j<i with |π(i)−π(j)|=1}. Then
∑_{i∈I_val} log(1+t_i) ≤ ∑_{v=1}^{n−1} log(1+s_v).
Proof. For each i∈I_val, let j be the argmin defining t_i, and set v= min{π(i),π(j)}. Then {v,v+1}={π(j),π(i)}, so s_v=|pos[v+1]−pos[v]|=|i−j|=t_i. This i↦v map is injective because for a fixed pair (v,v+1), only the later of pos[v],pos[v+1] can produce such i, and it produces it at most once (the earlier element cannot map to this pair). Summing log(1+t_i)=log(1+s_v) over i and relaxing injectivity yields the inequality.

Proposition 4 (A simple universal upper bound: Reg_log ≤ O(log n)·MST_log)
For any fixed norm ||·|| and all π,
Reg_log(π) ≤ (log n / log(1+β))·MST_log^{||·||}(π),
where β := min{||(1,0)||, ||(0,1)||} > 0 depends only on the norm.
Proof. Since r_i ≤ i, Reg_log(π) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+i) ≤ (n−1)·log n. Any MST has n−1 edges and each edge has weight at least log(1+β) (the minimum nonzero grid distance). Thus MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≥ (n−1)·log(1+β). Combining yields the stated bound.
Remarks.
- In L∞, β=1 so Reg_log(π) ≤ (log n / log 2)·MST_log(π).
- A slightly different route also gives Reg_log(π) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+Δ_i) + ∑_{v=1}^{n−1} log(1+s_v) (by log-subadditivity and Lemma 3), hence Reg_log ≤ 2(n−1)·log n ≤ 2 (log n / log(1+β))·MST_log. The previous bound improves the constant.

Separation family (tightness up to Θ(log n))
Let n=2m and π list odds then evens: π(i)=2i−1 for i≤m, and π(m+j)=2j for j∈[1..m].
- MST_log (L∞): A spanning tree T connects consecutive odds and consecutive evens (each edge cost log 3), plus one bridge between the halves (cost log(n−2)). Therefore
MST_log(π) ≤ (n−2)·log 3 + log(n−2) = Θ(n).
- Reg_log: For i∈{2,…,m} (odd half), no earlier value-neighbor exists, so r_i = i and ∑_{i=2}^m log(1+r_i) = Θ(m log m). For i=m+1, d_{m+1}=m and t_{m+1}=m−1, so r_{m+1}=m+1, contributing Θ(log m). For i=m+j, j∈{2,…,m}, we have t_i=m−1 and d_i=2, hence r_i=m+1, contributing Θ(log m) each. Thus Reg_log(π)=Θ(m log m + m log m)=Θ(n log n).
Consequently Reg_log(π)/MST_log(π)=Θ(log n). Hence no universal constant C can satisfy Reg_log ≤ C·MST_log.

Summary of established relations
- Exact one-sided domination (L∞): MST_log(π) ≤ Reg_log(π) for all π.
- All norms: MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ C(||·||)·Reg_log(π) with C(||·||)=1+log(1+κ)/log 2 for any κ with ||·|| ≤ κ||·||_∞.
- Reverse inequality fails with constants: Reg_log/MST_log can be Θ(log n) (parity family). Nevertheless, universally Reg_log(π) ≤ (log n / log(1+β))·MST_log^{||·||}(π), and the Θ(log n) separation is tight up to constants.

Obstacles
- A tempting but false lower bound MST_log ≥ ∑_{i} log(1+Δ_i): it arises from confusing κ_G(t) with κ_H(t) for subgraphs; in fact κ_G(t) ≤ κ_H(t), so the integral identity cannot yield such a lower bound. The correct direction is MST_log ≤ ∑_{i} log(1+Δ_i) by taking the time-path as a spanning tree.
- Proving a sharper universal bound of the form ∑_v log(1+s_v) ≤ c·log n·MST_log (with an explicit small c) appears plausible but requires a refined cut/packing analysis across dyadic scales; a direct per-scale component lower bound is delicate due to potential long chains in G(t).

Next steps
- Tighten constants: compute the optimal norm-equivalence κ for L1 and L2 and extract explicit C(||·||) in Lemma 2.
- Pursue a dyadic cut/packing approach: aim to show ∑_v log(1+s_v) ≤ O(log n)·MST_log, which combined with Lemma 3 would give ∑ log(1+t_i) ≤ O(log n)·MST_log directly.
- Quantify expectations: prove E[MST_log]=Θ(n log n) under random π with explicit constants, and compare to E[Reg_log]=Θ(n log n).
- Explore whether for special classes (e.g., separable permutations) a two-sided constant-factor equivalence holds.

Formal statements suitable for proofs.md
Theorem A (One-sided domination). For any permutation π and the L∞ norm, MST_log(π) ≤ Reg_log(π). For any fixed norm ||·||, there exists a constant C(||·||) such that MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ C(||·||)·Reg_log(π).
Theorem B (Tight separation and logarithmic upper bound). There exists a family {π_n} with Reg_log(π_n)/MST_log(π_n)=Θ(log n). Nevertheless, for every fixed norm, Reg_log(π) ≤ (log n / log(1+β))·MST_log^{||·||}(π) for all π, where β=min{||(1,0)||,||(0,1)||}>0.
Lemma C (Temporal-to-value matching). With s_v=|pos[v+1]−pos[v]| and I_val as above, ∑_{i∈I_val} log(1+t_i) ≤ ∑_{v=1}^{n−1} log(1+s_v).
Each of these can be checked independently on small instances and scales, and the separation family can be validated exactly as above.
