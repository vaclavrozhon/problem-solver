  "summary_md": "Last round established a complete picture (up to constants) of MST_log vs Reg_log. Using Kruskal\u2019s integral identity and a sparse threshold graph H(t) we proved MST_log(L\u221e) \u2264 Reg_log(\u03c0); norm equivalence then gives MST_log^N(\u03c0) \u2264 C_N\u00b7Reg_log(\u03c0) for any fixed norm N (constants from operator-norm bounds). A mod-m/residue-class family (parity when m=2) yields MST_log=\u0398(n) but Reg_log=\u0398(n log n), so no universal constant C with Reg_log \u2264 C\u00b7MST_log. A trivial lower bound on MST edge weights gives Reg_log \u2264 (log(1+n)/log(1+\u03b1_N))\u00b7MST_log^N, so the worst-case gap is \u0398(log n) and this factor is tight.

  "highlights": [
    "Kruskal-integral + sparse H(t) construction yields MST_log(L\u221e) \u2264 \u2211_{i=2}^n log(1+min(\u0394_i,t_i)) \u2264 Reg_log(\u03c0).",
    "For any fixed norm N there is C_N with MST_log^N(\u03c0) \u2264 C_N\u00b7Reg_log(\u03c0) by norm equivalence (constant from ||\u00b7||_N \u2264 b_N||\u00b7||_\u221e).",
    "Mod-m (e.g. parity) permutations give MST_log(\u03c0)=\u0398(n) and Reg_log(\u03c0)=\u0398(n log n), so Reg_log/MST_log=\u0398(log n) and no constant-factor reverse bound exists.",
    "Universal upper bound: Reg_log(\u03c0) \u2264 (log(1+n)/log(1+\u03b1_N))\u00b7MST_log^N(\u03c0), where \u03b1_N>0 depends only on the norm (e.g. L\u221e: \u03b1=1 \u21d2 factor log(1+n)/log2).",
    "A prior direct charging argument had a gap; the component-count integral approach fixes it and yields tight worst-case bounds."
