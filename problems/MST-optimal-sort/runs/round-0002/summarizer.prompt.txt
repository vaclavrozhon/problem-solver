# Problem: Asymptotic Dominance Between an MST–Log Distance Measure and **Reg**

Let \(n \in \mathbb{N}\) and let \(\pi \in S_n\) be a permutation. Represent the input as
\[
P_\pi = \{\,p_i = (i,\pi(i)) : i=1,\dots,n\,\}\subset \{1,\dots,n\}^2 .
\]

Fix any norm \(\|\cdot\|\) on \(\mathbb{R}^2\) (e.g., \(L_1, L_2,\) or \(L_\infty\)). All choices are equivalent up to constant factors, so asymptotic comparisons are norm-invariant.

---

## Measure 1: \(\mathrm{MST}_{\log}(\pi)\)

Define edge weights between points \(p_i,p_j\) by  
\[
w(p_i,p_j)=\log\!\bigl(1+\|p_i-p_j\|\bigr),
\]  
where the logarithm base is fixed but arbitrary.

Let \(T\) be a minimum spanning tree of the complete graph on \(P_\pi\) with weights \(w\). Set  
\[
\boxed{\mathrm{MST}_{\log}(\pi)=\sum_{e\in E(T)} w(e).}
\]

---

## Measure 2: \(\mathrm{Reg}_{\log}(\pi)\)

For \(i \ge 2\), let

* **Value-distance from the previous key**  
  \[
  d_i = 1 + \#\{\,k < i : \min(\pi(i-1),\pi(i)) < \pi(k) < \max(\pi(i-1),\pi(i))\,\}.
  \]

* **Temporal distance to the most recent true neighbor in value order**  
  \[
  t_i = \min\{\, i-j : 1 \le j < i,\; |\pi(i)-\pi(j)| = 1 \,\},
  \]  
  with \(t_i = i-1\) if no such \(j\) exists.

* **Regional radius**  
  \[
  r_i = \min\{\, d_i + t_i,\; i \,\}.
  \]

Define the logged regional cost  
\[
\boxed{\mathrm{Reg}_{\log}(\pi) = \sum_{i=2}^n \log(1 + r_i).}
\]

Using \(\log(1+r_i)\) (rather than \(r_i-1\)) ensures that a **random permutation** has  
\[
\mathrm{Reg}_{\log}(\pi) = \Theta(n \log n),
\]  
matching the \(\Theta(n \log n)\) comparisons needed for typical sorting.  
Without the logarithm, \(\sum (r_i-1)\) for a random permutation is \(\Theta(n^2)\), which is too large compared to standard sorting bounds.

>    \(\mathrm{Reg}_{\log}(\pi_n)/\mathrm{MST}_{\log}(\pi_n)\)  
>    diverges as \(n \to \infty\).

**Notes.**

* The choice of norm and log base only rescales values by constants.  
* Using \(\log(1+r_i)\) aligns \(\mathrm{Reg}_{\log}\) with classical adaptive-sorting analyses where a random permutation costs \(\Theta(n\log n)\).  
* One may also consider variants such as asking whether  
  \[
  C^{-1}\mathrm{Reg}_{\log}(\pi)\le \mathrm{MST}_{\log}(\pi)\le C\,\mathrm{Reg}_{\log}(\pi)
  \]  
  holds for some universal \(C\).

# Research Notes



Summary of current understanding

- Definitions: P_π = {(i, π(i))}, MST_log uses weights w(u,v)=log(1+||u−v||). Reg_log(π)=∑_{i=2}^n log(1+r_i) with r_i=min(d_i+t_i, i), d_i counts prior values between π(i−1) and π(i), and t_i is the temporal distance to the most recent earlier value-neighbor (|Δ value|=1), defaulting to i−1 if none exists.

- One-sided domination (L∞): Using Kruskal’s integral identity, ∑_{e∈MST} log(1+ℓ_e) = ∫_0^∞ (κ(t)−1) dt/(1+t), where κ(t) is the number of components in the threshold graph with edges of L∞-length ≤ t. Build a sparse subgraph H(t): when processing p_i, add the time edge (i−1,i) if |π(i)−π(i−1)|≤t, and the value-neighbor edge to the most recent earlier neighbor if t_i≤t. Then κ_G(t) ≤ κ_H(t) ≤ 1 + |{i≥2: Δ_i>t and t_i>t}|. Integrating yields MST_log(L∞) ≤ ∑ log(1+min(Δ_i,t_i)) ≤ ∑ log(1+r_i) = Reg_log.

- Norm invariance: For any norm ||·|| with ||z|| ≤ b||z||∞, choose an L∞-MST T∞ and obtain MST_log(||·||) ≤ (n−1)log(1+b) + MST_log(L∞) ≤ (1 + log(1+b)/log 3)·Reg_log, since Reg_log ≥ (n−1)log 3.

- Separation (no reverse domination): Order values by residue classes mod m, listing each class block in increasing order. For fixed m, we can span each block by index-adjacent edges (each costs log(1+m) under L∞), and connect the blocks with O(m) bridges (each costs O(log n)). Hence MST_log = Θ(n). Meanwhile, for any r≥2 and any element v=r+k m of class r, the earlier neighbor v−1 lies in class r−1 exactly m_{r−1} positions earlier, so t_i = m_{r−1} = Θ(n/m); therefore Reg_log ≥ ∑_{r=2}^m m_r log(1+m_{r−1}) = Θ(n log(n/m)). For m constant (e.g., parity), Reg_log/MST_log = Θ(log n).

- Remarks: A previously attempted charge (linking the value-adjacency path edge length directly to t_i at the later endpoint) is invalid in general (the closest earlier neighbor might be v±2). The component-integral method avoids this pitfall.

Open directions

- Likely tight frontier: prove a universal upper bound Reg_log(π) ≤ O(log n)·MST_log(π) for all π, matching the Θ(log n) lower bound from mod-m families.
- Tighten constants in the domination for specific norms; compute best b for L1 and L2.
- Quantify leading constants for E[MST_log], E[Reg_log] under random π.


Addition: universal logarithmic upper bound

- Minimal MST edge weight: For any fixed norm N on R^2, there exists α_N>0 such that ||z||_N ≥ α_N||z||_∞ for all z. Since any two distinct points p_i=(i,π(i)), p_j differ by at least 1 in each coordinate, ||p_i−p_j||_∞ ≥ 1, hence ||p_i−p_j||_N ≥ α_N. Therefore every tree edge has weight ≥ log(1+α_N), so MST_log^N(π) ≥ (n−1)·log(1+α_N).
- Trivial Reg upper bound: r_i ≤ i implies Reg_log(π) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+i) ≤ (n−1)·log(1+n).
- Combining: Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/log(1+α_N)) · MST_log^N(π) for all π. In particular: L∞ gives factor log(1+n)/log 2; for L2, one may sharpen c_N using ||(1,1)||_2=√2 (so each edge has weight ≥ log(1+√2)); for L1 similarly ||(1,1)||_1=2.

Thus, universally Reg_log ≤ Θ(log n)·MST_log, matching the Θ(log n) lower bound from parity/mod-m constructions. This complements the established MST_log ≤ Reg_log (exact in L∞, constant-factor for any fixed norm).

# Main Results



Main results

- One-sided domination: For L∞, MST_log(π) ≤ Reg_log(π) for all π. For any fixed norm N on R^2, MST_log^N(π) ≤ C_N·Reg_log(π) with a universal constant C_N.
- No reverse domination: There is no constant C such that Reg_log(π) ≤ C·MST_log(π) for all π. In particular, parity/mod-m block permutations satisfy MST_log(π)=Θ(n) while Reg_log(π)=Θ(n log n), so Reg_log/MST_log=Θ(log n).


Additional result: For any fixed norm N, Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/c_N)·MST_log^N(π), where c_N>0 depends only on the norm (e.g., L∞: c_∞=log 2; L2: c_2=log(1+√2); L1: c_1=log 3). Thus universally Reg_log ≤ Θ(log n)·MST_log, and the Θ(log n) factor is tight by the parity/mod-m family. Combined with MST_log ≤ C_N·Reg_log, we have a tight two-sided comparison up to a Θ(log n) factor in the worst case.


=== Verifier Summary ===

We have: (1) MST_log(π) ≤ Reg_log(π) for L∞, and for any fixed norm N, MST_log^N(π) ≤ C_N·Reg_log(π) via norm equivalence. (2) No reverse constant-factor bound: mod-m (parity) permutations achieve Reg_log/MST_log = Θ(log n). (3) Universal upper bound Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/c_N)·MST_log^N(π), where c_N>0 depends only on the norm; thus Reg ≤ Θ(log n)·MST, and the Θ(log n) factor is tight. Minor issues in one per-scale lemma and in a norm-constant choice were identified and corrected.

# Rigorous Proofs



Theorem 1 (One-sided domination).
For the L∞ norm on R^2 and any permutation π, MST_log(π) ≤ Reg_log(π). For any fixed norm N, there exists a universal constant C_N such that MST_log^N(π) ≤ C_N·Reg_log(π) for all π.

Proof.
1) Kruskal integral identity for log weights. Let d(u,v) be the L∞ distance. For t≥0 let G(t) be the graph on P_π with edges {u,v} whenever d(u,v) ≤ t, and let κ(t) be the number of connected components of G(t). Let ℓ_1≤⋯≤ℓ_{n−1} be the L∞-lengths of the MST edges. Since log(1+x)=∫_0^x dt/(1+t),
∑_{j=1}^{n−1} log(1+ℓ_j) = ∫_0^∞ m(t) dt/(1+t), where m(t)=|{j: ℓ_j ≥ t}|.
By Kruskal’s algorithm, m(t) = κ(t) − 1. Hence
MST_log(L∞) = ∫_0^∞ (κ(t)−1) dt/(1+t).

2) A sparse super-bound on κ(t). Process points in time order i=1,…,n and build a graph H(t) by adding (to earlier vertices only):
- the time edge {i−1,i} if Δ_i := |π(i)−π(i−1)| ≤ t;
- the value-neighbor edge {j,i} where j<i achieves t_i:=min{i−j: |π(i)−π(j)|=1}, if t_i ≤ t (if no such j exists, we skip this edge).
Every inserted edge has L∞-length ≤ t, so H(t) is a subgraph of G(t), and κ(t) ≤ κ_H(t). Moreover, when adding p_i, if both Δ_i>t and t_i>t then no edge is added from p_i to the existing graph and the number of components increases by at most 1; otherwise p_i attaches (possibly merging components). Therefore κ_H(t) ≤ 1 + |{i≥2: Δ_i>t and t_i>t}|.
Combining with (1),
MST_log(L∞) ≤ ∫_0^∞ |{i≥2: Δ_i>t and t_i>t}| dt/(1+t)
= ∑_{i=2}^n ∫_0^{min(Δ_i,t_i)} dt/(1+t)
= ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+min(Δ_i,t_i)).
Since r_i := min(d_i+t_i, i) ≥ t_i, we get
MST_log(L∞) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+r_i) = Reg_log(π).

3) Norm lifting. For any norm N there is b_N>0 with ||z||_N ≤ b_N||z||_∞. For any spanning tree T,
∑_{e∈T} log(1+||e||_N) ≤ ∑_{e∈T} log(1+b_N||e||_∞) ≤ (n−1)log(1+b_N) + ∑_{e∈T} log(1+||e||_∞).
Choose T to be an L∞-MST and apply the L∞ bound:
MST_log^N(π) ≤ (n−1)log(1+b_N) + MST_log(L∞) ≤ (n−1)log(1+b_N) + Reg_log(π).
Since r_i ≥ 2 for all i≥2, Reg_log(π) ≥ (n−1)·log 3. Thus
MST_log^N(π) ≤ (1 + log(1+b_N)/log 3) · Reg_log(π) =: C_N·Reg_log(π).
This proves Theorem 1. ∎

Theorem 2 (Separation; no reverse domination).
There is no universal C>0 such that Reg_log(π) ≤ C·MST_log(π) for all π. In fact, there is a family with Reg_log/MST_log = Θ(log n).

Proof.
Fix an integer m≥2 and, for each n, order the values by residue classes modulo m: list all numbers congruent to 1 mod m in increasing order, then 2 mod m, …, then m mod m. Let m_r be the size of class r (m_r = ⌊(n−r)/m⌋+1 or ⌈n/m⌉; in any case m_r = Θ(n/m)).

MST upper bound (L∞). Within each residue class r, connect consecutive indices inside that block: each such edge has L∞-length m, hence weight log(1+m). Summed over all classes this contributes (n−m)·log(1+m). Add m−1 “bridging” edges to connect the m blocks arbitrarily; each has length O(n) and weight O(log n). Therefore MST_log(π) ≤ (n−m)·log(1+m) + O(m log n) = Θ(n) for fixed m. A matching lower bound Ω(n) holds because every edge in L∞ has length ≥1, so every tree edge costs at least log 2; hence MST_log(π) ≥ (n−1)·log 2.

Reg lower bound. Consider a value v=r+k m in class r≥2. Its earlier true neighbor v−1 lies in class r−1 and occurs exactly m_{r−1} indices earlier, so t_i = m_{r−1}. Hence r_i ≥ t_i and
Reg_log(π) ≥ ∑_{r=2}^m m_r·log(1+m_{r−1}) = Θ(n log(n/m)).
For fixed m (e.g., m=2), Reg_log(π) = Θ(n log n) while MST_log(π) = Θ(n), so Reg_log(π)/MST_log(π) = Θ(log n). ∎

Corollary (parity blocks). Taking m=2 (all odds, then all evens, or vice versa) yields Reg_log(π)=Θ(n log n) and MST_log(π)=Θ(n).


Theorem 3 (Universal logarithmic upper bound: Reg_log ≤ O(log n)·MST_log).
Let N be any fixed norm on R^2. There exists α_N>0 such that for all π ∈ S_n,
Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/log(1+α_N)) · MST_log^N(π).

Proof.
1) Minimal edge weight. Since all norms on R^2 are equivalent, there exists α_N>0 with ||z||_N ≥ α_N||z||_∞ for all z∈R^2. For any distinct p_i=(i,π(i)) and p_j, we have ||p_i−p_j||_∞ ≥ 1 (both coordinates differ by at least 1), hence ||p_i−p_j||_N ≥ α_N and w(p_i,p_j)=log(1+||p_i−p_j||_N) ≥ log(1+α_N). Any spanning tree has n−1 edges, so MST_log^N(π) ≥ (n−1)·log(1+α_N).
2) Trivial Reg upper bound. For each i≥2, r_i ≤ i, hence Reg_log(π)=∑_{i=2}^n log(1+r_i) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+i) ≤ (n−1)·log(1+n).
3) Divide the two bounds to obtain the claim. ∎

Remark 3.1 (Explicit constants for common norms). For L∞, α_∞=1 gives Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/log 2)·MST_log^∞(π). For L2, using that both coordinates differ, ||p_i−p_j||_2 ≥ √2 yields c_2=log(1+√2) and Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/log(1+√2))·MST_log^2(π). For L1, ||p_i−p_j||_1 ≥ 2 gives c_1=log 3 and Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/log 3)·MST_log^1(π).

Together with Theorem 1 (MST_log ≤ Reg_log for L∞ and constant-factor for any norm) and Theorem 2 (mod-m separation giving Reg_log/MST_log = Θ(log n)), this characterizes the worst-case relationship up to a tight Θ(log n) factor.

Main results

- One-sided domination: For L∞, MST_log(π) ≤ Reg_log(π) for all π. For any fixed norm N on R^2, MST_log^N(π) ≤ C_N·Reg_log(π) with a universal constant C_N.
- No reverse domination: There is no constant C such that Reg_log(π) ≤ C·MST_log(π) for all π. In particular, parity/mod-m block permutations satisfy MST_log(π)=Θ(n) while Reg_log(π)=Θ(n log n), so Reg_log/MST_log=Θ(log n).


Additional result: For any fixed norm N, Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/c_N)·MST_log^N(π), where c_N>0 depends only on the norm (e.g., L∞: c_∞=log 2; L2: c_2=log(1+√2); L1: c_1=log 3). Thus universally Reg_log ≤ Θ(log n)·MST_log, and the Θ(log n) factor is tight by the parity/mod-m family. Combined with MST_log ≤ C_N·Reg_log, we have a tight two-sided comparison up to a Θ(log n) factor in the worst case.
