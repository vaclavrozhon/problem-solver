They concluded it's tight, but I need to compute the best constants C_N and C' for norms. I should also quantify expectations for random permutations and look for those with separation greater than Theta(log n). However, the upper bounds suggest they can't exceed this. They showed that the worst-case ratio between MST and Reg lies between Theta(1) and Theta(log n). Let's dive deeper into those constants and random expectations!",

It turns out MST_log is \u0398(n) while Reg_log is \u0398(n log n), leading to Reg/MST being \u0398(log n). There's no universal constant that bounds Reg \u2264 C MST, but there exists a universal upper bound for Reg. I need to highlight some key points:\n\n- Using Kruskal's integral and H(t) shows MST_log(L\u221e) \u2264 Reg_log.\n- For fixed norm N, we have MST_log^N \u2264 C_N Reg_log.\n- Mod-m permutations yield Reg/MST = \u0398(log n).\n- The upper bound for Reg_log is tied to norm parameters, with variations for different norms.\n- The previous charging approach needed improvement, which the component-integral method addresses.

A trivial lower bound on MST edge weights gives Reg_log \u2264 (log(1+n)/log(1+\u03b1_N))\u00b7MST_log^N, so the worst-case gap is \u0398(log n) and this factor is tight.
