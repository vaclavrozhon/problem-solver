Last round established a complete picture (up to constants) of MST_log vs Reg_log. Using Kruskal’s integral identity and a sparse threshold graph H(t) we proved MST_log(L∞) ≤ Reg_log(π); norm equivalence then gives MST_log^N(π) ≤ C_N·Reg_log(π) for any fixed norm N (constants from operator-norm bounds). A mod-m/residue-class family (parity when m=2) yields MST_log=Θ(n) but Reg_log=Θ(n log n), so no universal constant C with Reg_log ≤ C·MST_log. A trivial lower bound on MST edge weights gives Reg_log ≤ (log(1+n)/log(1+α_N))·MST_log^N, so the worst-case gap is Θ(log n) and this factor is tight. (References: Research Notes; Current Proofs.)
