We have: (1) MST_log(π) ≤ Reg_log(π) for L∞, and for any fixed norm N, MST_log^N(π) ≤ C_N·Reg_log(π) via norm equivalence. (2) No reverse constant-factor bound: mod-m (parity) permutations achieve Reg_log/MST_log = Θ(log n). (3) Universal upper bound Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/c_N)·MST_log^N(π), where c_N>0 depends only on the norm; thus Reg ≤ Θ(log n)·MST, and the Θ(log n) factor is tight. Minor issues in one per-scale lemma and in a norm-constant choice were identified and corrected.
