Main results

- One-sided domination: For L∞, MST_log(π) ≤ Reg_log(π) for all π. For any fixed norm N on R^2, MST_log^N(π) ≤ C_N·Reg_log(π) with a universal constant C_N.
- No reverse domination: There is no constant C such that Reg_log(π) ≤ C·MST_log(π) for all π. In particular, parity/mod-m block permutations satisfy MST_log(π)=Θ(n) while Reg_log(π)=Θ(n log n), so Reg_log/MST_log=Θ(log n).


Additional result: For any fixed norm N, Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/c_N)·MST_log^N(π), where c_N>0 depends only on the norm (e.g., L∞: c_∞=log 2; L2: c_2=log(1+√2); L1: c_1=log 3). Thus universally Reg_log ≤ Θ(log n)·MST_log, and the Θ(log n) factor is tight by the parity/mod-m family. Combined with MST_log ≤ C_N·Reg_log, we have a tight two-sided comparison up to a Θ(log n) factor in the worst case.
