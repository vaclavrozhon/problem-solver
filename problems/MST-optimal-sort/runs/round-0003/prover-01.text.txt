# Ideas

- Tighten constants in MST_log ≤ C·Reg_log for common norms via a simple comparison between L∞ and Lp: obtain C_p = 1 + (log 2)/(p·log 3) for p∈[1,∞], improving previous crude constants.
- Give a norm-specific reverse bound Reg_log ≤ (log(1+n)/log(1+2^{1/p}))·MST_log for Lp, exploiting that both coordinate gaps are ≥1.
- Generalize the L∞ domination to any concave weight φ with φ(0)=0: MST_φ ≤ ∑ φ(min{Δ_i,t_i}). This clarifies the mechanism and may help extend to other adaptive measures.
- Make the mod–m separation quantitative with explicit leading constants under Lp.

# Basic facts used repeatedly

- For i≥2, set Δ_i := |π(i)−π(i−1)|. Then d_i ≤ Δ_i (at most Δ_i−1 values strictly between, plus 1).
- For all i≥2, r_i = min(d_i+t_i, i) ≥ 2, hence Reg_log(π) ≥ (n−1)·log 3.
- For any spanning tree, each edge length in L∞ is ≥1, thus each MST edge has weight ≥ log 2 in L∞. For Lp (1≤p<∞), each difference vector has both coordinates ≥1, hence ||(dx,dy)||_p ≥ (1^p + 1^p)^{1/p} = 2^{1/p} and each edge weight ≥ log(1+2^{1/p}).

# Domination MST_log ≤ Reg_log (L∞, concave weights)

Theorem A (general concave domination in L∞). Let φ:[0,∞)→[0,∞) be concave, nondecreasing, with φ(0)=0. For L∞ distances and the threshold graphs G(t) joining pairs with ||·||∞ ≤ t,

MST_φ(π) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n φ(min{Δ_i,t_i}).

Proof. Kruskal–integral identity: MST_φ = ∫_0^∞ (κ_G(t)−1) φ′(t) dt (φ′ is a.e.-defined, nonincreasing). Build H(t) by, for each i≥2, adding the time edge (i−1,i) if Δ_i≤t and the recent value-neighbor edge (j,i) if t_i≤t. Then H(t)⊆G(t), so κ_G(t)≤κ_H(t). Scanning i=2,…,n, the component count increases by at most 1 exactly when both edges are absent, i.e., Δ_i>t and t_i>t. Thus κ_H(t)−1 ≤ |{i≥2: min(Δ_i,t_i)>t}|. Integrating gives

MST_φ ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n ∫_0^{min(Δ_i,t_i)} φ′(t) dt = ∑_{i=2}^n φ(min{Δ_i,t_i}).

Corollary A1 (our weight). With φ(x)=log(1+x), for L∞,

MST_log(π) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+min{Δ_i,t_i}) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+r_i) = Reg_log(π).

# Lifting to general norms with improved constants

Lemma B (lifting via norm equivalence). Let ||·|| be any norm on R^2 and b:=sup_{z≠0} ||z||/||z||∞ (finite in R^2). Then for all π,

MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ MST_log^{∞}(π) + (n−1)·log b.

Proof. For any edge e, 1+||e|| ≤ 1 + b||e||∞ ≤ b(1 + ||e||∞) since b≥1. Taking logs and summing over any spanning tree (e.g., an L∞–MST) gives the claim.

Combining with Corollary A1 and Reg_log ≥ (n−1)log 3 yields

MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ (1 + (log b)/(log 3)) · Reg_log(π).

Explicit Lp constants in R^2: b_p = sup ||z||_p/||z||∞ = 2^{1/p}. Hence

C_p := 1 + (log b_p)/(log 3) = 1 + (log 2)/(p·log 3),

giving MST_log^{(p)}(π) ≤ C_p · Reg_log(π). This recovers exact C_∞=1 and improves constants for p=1,2.

# Reverse inequality up to Θ(log n) and sharp Lp constants

Lemma C (universal logarithmic upper bound, Lp). For p∈[1,∞], every MST edge under Lp has weight ≥ log(1+2^{1/p}). Therefore,

Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/log(1+2^{1/p})) · MST_log^{(p)}(π).

Proof. Trivial bound Reg_log ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+i) ≤ (n−1)·log(1+n). Each MST has n−1 edges and, as noted, each Lp edge has length ≥ 2^{1/p} so weight ≥ log(1+2^{1/p}). Divide.

Consequently, for each fixed p, sup_π Reg_log(π)/MST_log^{(p)}(π) = Θ(log n) (lower bound by the mod–m family below).

# Quantitative separation via mod–m interleavings

Construction: Fix m≥2 and write n = m q (assume divisible for simplicity). Partition values {1,…,n} into m contiguous blocks B_r = {(r−1)q+1,…,rq}. Order indices i = r + m·k for r∈{1,…,m}, k=0,…,q−1, and map π(i) to the k-th element of block B_r in increasing order. Thus we interleave the blocks cyclically.

- MST_log (Lp): Within each block B_r, the indices form a path with steps (Δx,Δy) = (m,1). The Lp length of such steps is (m^p+1)^{1/p}, so each intra-block edge contributes log(1+(m^p+1)^{1/p}). There are m(q−1) such edges. We need m−1 bridges, each between the heads of consecutive blocks; their Lp-lengths are O(q) so total bridge cost O(m·log q). Hence

MST_log^{(p)}(π) ≤ m(q−1)·log(1+(m^p+1)^{1/p}) + O(m·log q) = Θ(n).

- Reg_log: For any element at position k in its block (k≥1), the most recent earlier true neighbor (value ±1) lives in a different block and appears exactly m indices earlier, repeated every cycle; more precisely t_i = m for all but O(m) first occurrences across blocks. Also d_i ≳ k (the number of earlier elements between consecutive values is ≈ k). Hence r_i ≳ k+m and

Reg_log(π) ≥ ∑_{r=1}^m ∑_{k=1}^q log(1+k) = m·Θ(q log q) = Θ(n log(n/m)).

Taking m constant (e.g., m=2) yields Reg_log/MST_log = Θ(log n). This matches Lemma C’s upper bound up to constants.

# Additional observation: sharp constants for parity case

For m=2 under L∞, the explicit spanning tree with odd/evens connected by (Δx,Δy)=(2,1) edges and one bridge gives

MST_log^{(∞)}(π) ≤ (n−2)·log 3 + log(1+n/2) = n·log 3 + O(log n).

Meanwhile Reg_log(π) = ∑_{m=1}^{n/2} [log(2+m)+log(3+m)] = n·log n/2 + O(n). Hence Reg_log/MST_log = (log n)/(2 log 3) + o(log n).

Analogous constants for Lp are obtained by replacing log 3 with log(1+(2^p+1)^{1/p}).

# Obstacles

- Extending the exact L∞ domination (Theorem A) to other norms without a constant-factor loss seems nontrivial because the clean “two local edges suffice” threshold construction hinges on the max-metric’s separability of constraints. A direct threshold change-of-variables for Lp introduces a non-linear ψ_p(t) that complicates the integral comparison; a uniform φ-based inequality does not appear to yield MST_p ≤ Reg without an additive (n−1)·log b_p term.
- Any attempt to prove Reg_log ≤ c·MST_log with c independent of n contradicts the mod–m family; efforts should focus on optimal constant factors in the Θ(log n) bound.

# Next steps

- Record and verify exact constants C_p = 1 + (log 2)/(p·log 3) for MST_log^{(p)} ≤ C_p·Reg_log, and constants in Lemma C for Reg_log ≤ (log(1+n)/log(1+2^{1/p}))·MST_log^{(p)}.
- Tighten the Θ(n) evaluation of MST_log for mod–m to an asymptotic with precise leading constant: n·log(1+(m^p+1)^{1/p}) + o(n) (bridge term negligible), and similarly quantify the exact leading term of Reg_log.
- Explore general concave weights beyond log: by Theorem A, for L∞ one obtains MST_φ ≤ ∑ φ(min{Δ_i,t_i}); classify φ for which a Θ(log n) worst-case gap persists (e.g., φ(x)=log^α(1+x)).
- Optional: compute E[MST_log], E[Reg_log] for a random permutation under Lp to calibrate constants; likely both are Θ(n log n) with different leading constants, testable via the integral representations.
