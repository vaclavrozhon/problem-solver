# Ideas

- Finalize a universal upper bound Reg_log ≤ O(log n)·MST_log with explicit constants, including sharp constants for L_p norms.
- Record a clean proof template: (i) per-edge lower bound on MST_log, (ii) trivial upper bound on Reg_log via r_i ≤ i, (iii) combine.
- Slightly sharpen constants in MST_log ≤ C·Reg_log for common norms by tracking norm-equivalence precisely.

# Lemmas and Proofs

Lemma A (Per-edge metric lower bounds for permutation point sets). Let p_i=(i,π(i)). For any two distinct indices i≠j, both coordinate differences satisfy |i−j| ≥ 1 and |π(i)−π(j)| ≥ 1. Hence for L_p norms (1 ≤ p ≤ ∞):
- L∞: ∥p_i−p_j∥∞ ≥ 1;
- L2: ∥p_i−p_j∥2 ≥ √2;
- L1: ∥p_i−p_j∥1 ≥ 2.
More generally, for any fixed norm ∥·∥ there exists β_∥·∥ := inf{∥(x,y)∥ : x,y ≥ 1} > 0 with ∥p_i−p_j∥ ≥ β_∥·∥ for all i≠j.

Proof. For permutations, the two coordinates are distinct at distinct indices; thus both coordinate gaps are integers ≥1. The L_p bounds are immediate. For a general norm, the set {(x,y): x,y ≥ 1} is closed, and by positive homogeneity the infimum over this set equals the minimum on the compact set {x,y ∈ [1,2]}, hence positive. ∎

Lemma B (Baseline MST_log lower bounds). With weights w(e)=log(1+∥e∥), every spanning tree T on P_π satisfies
- L∞: w(T) ≥ (n−1)·log 2;
- L2: w(T) ≥ (n−1)·log(1+√2);
- L1: w(T) ≥ (n−1)·log 3;
- General norm ∥·∥: w(T) ≥ (n−1)·log(1+β_∥·∥).

Proof. Apply Lemma A to each edge of T and sum. ∎

Lemma C (Trivial Reg_log upper bound). For all i, r_i ≤ i, hence
Reg_log(π) = ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+r_i) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+i) ≤ (n−1)·log(1+n).

Proof. Monotonicity of log and telescoping integral bound ∑_{k=2}^n log(1+k) ≤ (n−1) log(1+n) are standard. ∎

Theorem D (Universal logarithmic upper bound of Reg by MST). For any fixed norm ∥·∥ and any permutation π,
Reg_log(π) ≤ [log(1+n)/log(1+β_∥·∥)] · MST_log^{∥·∥}(π).
In particular, for L_p:
- L∞: Reg_log(π) ≤ [log(1+n)/log 2] · MST_log^{∞}(π);
- L2: Reg_log(π) ≤ [log(1+n)/log(1+√2)] · MST_log^{2}(π);
- L1: Reg_log(π) ≤ [log(1+n)/log 3] · MST_log^{1}(π).

Proof. Combine Lemma C with Lemma B: Reg_log ≤ (n−1) log(1+n) and MST_log ≥ (n−1) log(1+β), then divide. ∎

Remark. The logarithmic factor Θ(log n) is tight up to constant factors by the residue-class family (Proposition 6 in the notes): for fixed m≥2, MST_log = Θ(n) while Reg_log = Θ(n log(n/m)), so Reg_log/MST_log ≍ log n.

Corollary E (Sharpened constants for MST ≤ C·Reg). Using norm equivalence ∥z∥ ≤ b∥z∥∞ (with b=2 for L1, b=√2 for L2), and Lemma 4 in the notes (Reg_log ≥ (n−1) log 3),
MST_log^{∥·∥}(π) ≤ (1 + log(1+b)/log 3) · Reg_log(π).
Numerically: L1 gives factor 2; L2 gives 1 + log(1+√2)/log 3 ≈ 1.802; L∞ gives factor 1 (exact inequality MST_log^{∞} ≤ Reg_log).

Proof. For an L∞-MST T∞, log(1+∥e∥) ≤ log(1+b∥e∥∞) ≤ log(1+b)+log(1+∥e∥∞). Sum over e∈T∞ and absorb the additive (n−1) log(1+b) using Reg_log ≥ (n−1) log 3. ∎

# Examples

- Identity permutation: MST_log^{∞} = (n−1) log 2; Reg_log = (n−1) log 3. Matches Theorem D with room to spare, and shows exactness of MST_log^{∞} ≤ Reg_log up to a factor log 3/log 2.
- Mod-m residue classes (fixed m): MST_log^{∞} ≤ (n−m) log(1+m) + (m−1) log(1+n) = Θ(n); together with Lemma B gives Θ(n). Reg_log ≥ ∑_{r=2}^m m_r log(1+m_{r−1}) = Θ(n log(n/m)). Thus Reg/MST = Θ(log n), saturating Theorem D.

# Obstacles

- Improving the universal factor below Θ(log n) seems impossible due to the mod-m construction. Any refinement must be instance-sensitive (e.g., in terms of diameter or structural statistics of π), not purely in n.
- Tight characterization of E[MST_log] for random π via the component integral remains open; bounding E[κ(t)] for permutation threshold graphs appears nontrivial.

# Next steps

- Record explicit constants β_∥·∥ for other common norms (e.g., L_p: β_p = 2^{1/p}, yielding log(1+2^{1/p})).
- Explore instance-sensitive bounds: can Reg_log ≤ O(log D)·MST_log where D is the L∞-diameter of P_π (here D=Θ(n), so this coincides with our bound, but structural refinements might shrink the factor)?
- For random π, attempt to estimate E[MST_log] via the integral identity by approximating E[κ(t)] using Poissonization of points near the diagonal band of width t.
