  "summary_md": "Last round completed a near-exact characterization (up to constants) of MST_log vs Reg_log. Using Kruskal\u2019s integral identity and a sparse threshold graph H(t) we proved MST_log(L\u221e) \u2264 Reg_log(\u03c0); norm equivalence lifts this to MST_log^N(\u03c0) \u2264 C_N\u00b7Reg_log(\u03c0) for any fixed norm. A residue-class (mod-m, e.g. parity) family gives MST_log=\u0398(n) but Reg_log=\u0398(n log n), so Reg_log/MST_log=\u0398(log n) and no constant-factor reverse bound exists. A trivial per-edge lower bound on MST yields Reg_log(\u03c0) \u2264 (log(1+n)/log(1+\u03b1_N))\u00b7MST_log^N(\u03c0), so the worst-case gap is \u0398(log n) and tight.

    "Kruskal-integral + sparse H(t) construction yields MST_log(L\u221e) \u2264 \u2211_{i=2}^n log(1+min(\u0394_i,t_i)) \u2264 Reg_log(\u03c0).",
    "By norm equivalence, for any fixed norm N there is C_N with MST_log^N(\u03c0) \u2264 C_N\u00b7Reg_log(\u03c0) (constants from operator-norm bounds).",
    "Mod-m (parity) permutations give MST_log(\u03c0)=\u0398(n) but Reg_log(\u03c0)=\u0398(n log n), so Reg_log/MST_log=\u0398(log n) (no reverse domination).",
    "Universal upper bound: Reg_log(\u03c0) \u2264 (log(1+n)/log(1+\u03b1_N))\u00b7MST_log^N(\u03c0), with explicit c_N for common norms (L\u221e: log2, L2: log(1+\u221a2), L1: log3).",
    "Thus the worst-case multiplicative gap between the two measures is \u0398(log n), and this factor is tight."
