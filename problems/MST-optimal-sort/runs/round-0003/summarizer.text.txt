{"summary_md":"Last round completed a near-exact characterization (up to constants) of MST_log vs Reg_log. Using Kruskal’s integral identity and a sparse threshold graph H(t) we proved MST_log(L∞) ≤ Reg_log(π); norm equivalence lifts this to MST_log^N(π) ≤ C_N·Reg_log(π) for any fixed norm. A residue-class (mod-m, e.g. parity) family gives MST_log=Θ(n) but Reg_log=Θ(n log n), so Reg_log/MST_log=Θ(log n) and no constant-factor reverse bound exists. A trivial per-edge lower bound on MST yields Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/log(1+α_N))·MST_log^N(π), so the worst-case gap is Θ(log n) and tight.
