We finalized: (1) MST_log ≤ Reg_log (exact in L∞) via the Kruskal-integral method and H(t). (2) For any norm, MST_log^N ≤ (1 + (log b_N)/log 3)·Reg_log with b_N = sup ||z||/||z||∞; for L_p, C_p = 1 + (log 2)/(p·log 3). (3) Universal upper bound Reg_log ≤ (log(1+n)/c_N)·MST_log^N with c_N = log(1+α_N); for L∞/L2/L1: log 2, log(1+√2), log 3. (4) Mod-m (parity) permutations give Reg_log/MST_log = Θ(log n), proving tightness of the logarithmic factor.
