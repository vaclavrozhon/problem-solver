Ideas
- Consolidate and slightly strengthen the one-sided domination MST_log ≤ Reg_log via a fully explicit Kruskal–integral proof in L∞ and a sharper norm-lift (using log b rather than log(1+b)).
- Formalize a clean “temporal-to-value” inequality: ∑_{i with earlier value-neighbor} log(1+t_i) ≤ ∑_{v=1}^{n−1} log(1+s_v), where s_v=|pos[v+1]−pos[v]|. Useful to decompose Reg into time and value parts.
- Generalize to any nondecreasing concave transform φ: obtain MST_φ(L∞) ≤ ∑_i φ(min{Δ_i,t_i}).
- Calibrate constants for the universal upper bound Reg_log ≤ Θ(log n)·MST_log with explicit per-norm constants using the permutation-grid minimum distances. Confirm tightness via residue-class (mod m) families.

Proof details and lemmas
1) L∞ domination via Kruskal’s integral
Let G(t) be the threshold graph on P_π with edges of L∞-length ≤ t, and κ(t)=#components of G(t). The identity
MST_log(π;L∞) = ∫_0^∞ (κ(t)−1) dt/(1+t)
follows from Kruskal’s process (standard). Define a directed forest F(t) by assigning at most one parent par_t(i) to each i≥2:
- If Δ_i:=|π(i)−π(i−1)| ≤ t, set par_t(i)=i−1.
- Else if ∃ j<i with |π(i)−π(j)|=1 and i−j ≤ t (i.e., t_i ≤ t), set par_t(i)=j (the largest such j).
- Otherwise i is a root.
Each chosen edge has L∞-length ≤ t, thus F(t) ⊆ G(t), and #components(F(t))=1+|{i≥2: Δ_i>t and t_i>t}|. Hence κ(t) ≤ 1+|{i≥2: Δ_i>t and t_i>t}|. Integrating,
MST_log(π;L∞) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n ∫_0^∞ 1[Δ_i>t and t_i>t] dt/(1+t) = ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+min{Δ_i,t_i}).
Since r_i ≥ t_i, we get MST_log(π;L∞) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+r_i) = Reg_log(π).

2) Sharper norm lift
Let ||·|| be any norm with b := sup_{z≠0} ||z||/||z||_∞ ∈ [1,∞). For any edge e, 1+||e|| ≤ b(1+||e||_∞), so log(1+||e||) ≤ log b + log(1+||e||_∞). For an L∞-MST T_∞,
MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ (n−1)·log b + MST_log^{∞}(π) ≤ (n−1)·log b + Reg_log(π).
Since Reg_log(π) ≥ (n−1)·log 3 (because r_i ≥ 2),
MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ [1 + (log b)/log 3]·Reg_log(π).
For L_p in R^2, b=2^{1/p}, yielding C_p ≤ 1 + (log 2)/(p·log 3).

3) Temporal-to-value inequality
Let pos[v] be the index with π(pos[v])=v and s_v=|pos[v+1]−pos[v]|. For I_val={i≥2: ∃ j<i with |π(i)−π(j)|=1},
∑_{i∈I_val} log(1+t_i) ≤ ∑_{v=1}^{n−1} log(1+s_v).
Proof. For i∈I_val, among its two possible value-neighbors (π(i)±1), let v be the one minimizing |i−pos[v]| or |i−pos[v+1]|. Then t_i equals this minimum, which is s_v if i is the later among pos[v],pos[v+1]. The map i↦v is injective (a fixed v can be chosen only by the later index among pos[v],pos[v+1]). Summing gives the inequality.

4) Concave-weight generalization
Let φ:[0,∞)→[0,∞) be nondecreasing, concave, with φ(0)=0 and right-derivative g nonincreasing. Then φ(x)=∫_0^x g(u) du and
MST_φ(π;L∞) = ∑_e φ(ℓ_e) = ∫_0^∞ g(u)·#(e: ℓ_e>u) du = ∫_0^∞ g(u)·(κ(u)−1) du.
Using κ(u) ≤ 1+|{i: Δ_i>u and t_i>u}| as above yields
MST_φ(π;L∞) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n ∫_0^{min(Δ_i,t_i)} g(u) du = ∑_{i=2}^n φ(min{Δ_i,t_i}) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n φ(r_i).
This recovers the log case and may be of independent interest.

5) Universal logarithmic upper bound for Reg
Permutation-grid minimum distances imply every MST edge has weight at least c_N:=log(1+α_N), with
- L∞: α_∞=1 (both coordinates differ by ≥1) ⇒ c_∞=log 2.
- L2: α_2=√2 (both coordinates differ by ≥1) ⇒ c_2=log(1+√2).
- L1: α_1=2 ⇒ c_1=log 3.
Since r_i ≤ i, Reg_log(π) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+i) ≤ (n−1)·log(1+n) ≤ [log(1+n)/c_N]·MST_log^{||·||}(π).
Thus Reg_log ≤ Θ(log n)·MST_log with explicit constants; in L∞: Reg_log ≤ (log(1+n)/log 2)·MST_log.

6) Separation (tightness)
Residue-class (mod m) blocks: n=mq, π lists r, r+m, …, r+(q−1)m for r=1,…,m. Then
- MST_log(L∞): connect each block by time edges (each length m ⇒ weight log(1+m)), plus m−1 bridges (each length ≥ q ⇒ weight ≥ log(1+q)): total Θ(n log m + m log(n/m)).
- Reg_log: For r≥2, t_i equals q=n/m for almost all i in block r; d_i=O(m). Thus Reg_log = Θ(n log(n/m)).
For constant m (e.g., parity), MST_log=Θ(n) and Reg_log=Θ(n log n), so Reg_log/MST_log=Θ(log n), matching the universal upper bound.

Examples (sanity checks)
- Sorted/reversed: MST_log(L∞)=(n−1)·log 2; Reg_log=(n−1)·log 3.
- Random π: E[∑_v log(1+s_v)] and E[∑_i log(1+Δ_i)] are both Θ(n log n) (S=|X−Y| with X≠Y uniform gives E[log(1+S)] ≈ log n − 1). Hence E[MST_log]=O(n log n) and E[Reg_log]=Θ(n log n).

Obstacles
- A direct lower bound linking MST_log to either ∑ log(1+Δ_i) or ∑ log(1+s_v) is false; MST_log ≤ min of these by explicit spanning trees, but the reverse direction fails in general.
- Tightening Reg ≤ c·log n·MST to a small universal c likely requires a dyadic scale packing argument on threshold components beyond the trivial per-edge lower bound; establishing per-scale domination remains delicate.

Next steps
- Curate explicit constants: for L_p, record C_p ≤ 1 + (log 2)/(p·log 3) in MST ≤ C_p·Reg, and c_p in Reg ≤ (log(1+n)/c_p)·MST with c_∞=log 2, c_2=log(1+√2), c_1=log 3.
- Optional: include the concave-weight theorem MST_φ ≤ ∑ φ(r_i) in proofs.md.
- Quantify E[MST_log] more precisely via the integral identity by estimating E[κ(t)] for random π.
- Investigate whether special permutation classes (e.g., separable, layered) admit constant-factor two-sided equivalence.
