  "summary_md": "Last round completed a near-exact characterization (up to constants) of MST_log versus Reg_log. Using Kruskal\u2019s integral identity and a sparse threshold graph H(t) we proved MST_log(L\u221e) \u2264 Reg_log(\u03c0). Norm equivalence lifts this to MST_log^N(\u03c0) \u2264 C_N\u00b7Reg_log(\u03c0) for any fixed norm N. Residue-class (mod-m, e.g. parity) permutations give MST_log=\u0398(n) but Reg_log=\u0398(n log n), so Reg_log/MST_log=\u0398(log n) and no universal constant reverses the inequality. A trivial per-edge lower bound on MST yields Reg_log(\u03c0) \u2264 (log(1+n)/c_N)\u00b7MST_log^N(\u03c0) (c_N explicit for L\u221e,L2,L1), so the worst-case multiplicative gap is \u0398(log n) and is tight. (Sources: Research Notes; Current Proofs.)",

    "Kruskal-integral + sparse H(t) gives MST_log(L\u221e) \u2264 \u2211_{i=2}^n log(1+min(\u0394_i,t_i)) \u2264 Reg_log(\u03c0).",
    "For any fixed norm N there is a constant C_N with MST_log^N(\u03c0) \u2264 C_N\u00b7Reg_log(\u03c0) via norm equivalence/norm-lifting.",
    "Mod-m (residue-class) permutations (parity as m=2) satisfy MST_log=\u0398(n) but Reg_log=\u0398(n log n), so Reg_log/MST_log=\u0398(log n).",
    "Universal upper bound: Reg_log(\u03c0) \u2264 (log(1+n)/c_N)\u00b7MST_log^N(\u03c0) where c_N=log 2 (L\u221e), log(1+\u221a2) (L2), log 3 (L1).",
    "Consequently the worst-case gap between the two measures is \u0398(log n), and this factor is tight.",
    "Extensions: concave-weight generalization and a temporal-to-value pairing lemma (controls \u2211 log(1+t_i) by adjacent-position gaps)."
