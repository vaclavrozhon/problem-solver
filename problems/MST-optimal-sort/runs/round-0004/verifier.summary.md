We have rigorous results: (1) MST_log ≤ Reg_log for L∞; for any norm N, MST_log^N ≤ (1 + (log b_N)/log 3)·Reg_log with b_N = sup ||z||/||z||∞; for L_p, C_p = 1 + (log 2)/(p·log 3). (2) Universal reverse bound: Reg_log ≤ (log(1+n)/c_N)·MST_log^N with c_N from the minimal edge length (L∞: log 2; L2: log(1+√2); L1: log 3). (3) Mod-m permutations yield Reg/MST = Θ(log n), proving tightness. We also have a concave-weight extension MST_φ^∞ ≤ ∑ φ(min{Δ_i,t_i}) and a temporal-to-value pairing inequality.
