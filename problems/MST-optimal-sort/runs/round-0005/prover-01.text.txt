# Main Results and Proofs

We work on the point set P_π = {(i, π(i)) : i = 1,…,n}. Fix any norm ||·|| on R^2 and define the weight of an edge e = {p_i,p_j} to be w(e) = log(1 + ||p_i − p_j||). Let MST_log(π) be the total weight of a minimum spanning tree (MST) and Reg_log(π) := ∑_{i=2}^n log(1 + r_i) with r_i := min{d_i + t_i, i}, where
- d_i := 1 + #{k < i : min(π(i−1), π(i)) < π(k) < max(π(i−1), π(i))},
- t_i := min{i − j : 1 ≤ j < i and |π(i) − π(j)| = 1}, with t_i := i − 1 if no such j exists.

We use the L∞ norm first; all norms are equivalent up to constants, which we quantify below.


Theorem 1 (Reg dominates MST in L∞). For all permutations π, we have

MST_log^{(∞)}(π) ≤ Reg_log(π).

Proof.
Let G(t) be the threshold graph on P_π joining pairs at L∞-distance ≤ t, and let κ_G(t) denote its number of connected components. For any edge length ℓ, we have the layer-cake identity log(1 + ℓ) = ∫_0^∞ 1{t < ℓ} dt/(1 + t). Hence, writing the edge lengths of the L∞-MST as ℓ_1,…,ℓ_{n−1},

MST_log^{(∞)}(π) = ∑_{e} log(1 + ℓ_e) = ∫_0^∞ (# {e : ℓ_e > t}) dt/(1 + t).

We claim that # {e : ℓ_e > t} = κ_G(t) − 1 for every t ≥ 0. Indeed, in G(t) each connected component can be contracted; any spanning tree needs at least κ_G(t) − 1 edges joining different components, and Kruskal’s algorithm chooses exactly n − κ_G(t) edges of length ≤ t (the maximum possible without cycles), leaving exactly κ_G(t) − 1 edges of length > t. Therefore

MST_log^{(∞)}(π) = ∫_0^∞ (κ_G(t) − 1) dt/(1 + t).

Next we upper-bound κ_G(t) by a quantity expressible through (Δ_i, t_i), where Δ_i := |π(i) − π(i−1)| for i ≥ 2. Define a sparse subgraph H(t) on P_π as follows. For each i ≥ 2, add
- the “time edge” (i−1,i) if Δ_i ≤ t, and
- the “value-neighbor edge” (j,i), where j < i achieves t_i and |π(i) − π(j)| = 1, if t_i ≤ t.

Each such edge has L∞-length max(1,Δ_i) (for the time edge) or max(1,t_i) (for the value-neighbor edge), and since Δ_i, t_i ≥ 1 when present, these edges belong to G(t). Hence H(t) ⊆ G(t), so κ_G(t) ≤ κ_H(t).

Process vertices in order i = 1,2,…,n. Let κ_i(t) be the number of connected components in the subgraph of H(t) induced by {1,…,i}. Clearly κ_1(t) = 1. For i ≥ 2, if at least one of the two potential edges incident to i is present, then i is connected to {1,…,i−1} and κ_i(t) ≤ κ_{i−1}(t); if both edges are absent (i.e., Δ_i > t and t_i > t), then i forms a new component and κ_i(t) = κ_{i−1}(t) + 1. Thus

κ_H(t) = κ_n(t) ≤ 1 + |{i ≥ 2 : Δ_i > t and t_i > t}|.

Combining with the integral representation,

MST_log^{(∞)}(π) ≤ ∫_0^∞ |{i ≥ 2 : min(Δ_i, t_i) > t}| dt/(1 + t) = ∑_{i=2}^n log(1 + min(Δ_i, t_i)).

Finally, for each i ≥ 2 we have d_i ≤ Δ_i (since at most Δ_i − 1 integers lie strictly between π(i−1) and π(i)), and Δ_i ≤ i − 1 < i. Therefore

min(Δ_i, t_i) ≤ min(d_i + t_i, i) = r_i.

Applying log(1 + ·) to both sides and summing over i yields MST_log^{(∞)}(π) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n log(1 + r_i) = Reg_log(π), as claimed. ∎


Corollary 2 (Reg dominates MST for any norm, with an explicit constant). Let ||·|| be any norm on R^2 and set b := sup_{z≠0} ||z||/||z||_∞ (finite). Then for all π,

MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ (1 + (log b)/(log 3)) · Reg_log(π).

Proof.
For any edge e, 1 + ||e|| ≤ b(1 + ||e||_∞), hence log(1 + ||e||) ≤ log b + log(1 + ||e||_∞). Summing along an L∞-MST gives

MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ MST_log^{(∞)}(π) + (n − 1)·log b.

By Theorem 1, MST_log^{(∞)}(π) ≤ Reg_log(π). Also, r_i ≥ 2 for i ≥ 2 (since d_i ≥ 1 and t_i ≥ 1), so Reg_log(π) = ∑_{i=2}^n log(1 + r_i) ≥ (n − 1)·log 3. Therefore

MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ Reg_log(π) + (n − 1)·log b ≤ (1 + (log b)/(log 3)) · Reg_log(π). ∎


Theorem 3 (No reverse domination; optimal Θ(log n) separation). There is no universal constant C such that Reg_log(π) ≤ C · MST_log^{||·||}(π) holds for all n and all permutations π (for any fixed norm ||·||). In fact, there exists a family {π_n} with

Reg_log(π_n) / MST_log^{||·||}(π_n) = Θ(log n).

Proof.
It suffices to work under L∞ (the argument below also yields Θ(log n) for any fixed norm). For even n, define π by interleaving the lower and upper halves:

π(2m−1) = m and π(2m) = n/2 + m, for m = 1,…,n/2.

1) Upper bound on MST_log^{(∞)}(π).
Consider the spanning tree that connects the odd-indexed vertices in order (2m−1)→(2(m+1)−1) and similarly connects the even-indexed vertices in order, plus one bridge between the two chains. Along each odd chain step, the difference vector is (Δx,Δy) = (2,1), so the L∞-length is 2 and the weight is log 3. There are (n/2−1) such odd steps and (n/2−1) even steps, contributing (n−2)·log 3 in total. One bridge of length O(n) contributes O(log n). Hence MST_log^{(∞)}(π) ≤ (n−2)·log 3 + O(log n) = Θ(n).

a) A matching lower bound MST_log^{(∞)}(π) ≥ (n − 1)·log 2 holds for every permutation, since any two distinct permutation points have L∞-distance at least 1. Thus MST_log^{(∞)}(π) = Θ(n).

2) Lower bound on Reg_log(π).
We compute r_i explicitly. For i = 2m − 1 ≥ 3, we have π(i) = m and π(i−1) = n/2 + (m − 1). Among earlier indices k < i, exactly the even indices 2,4,…,2m − 4 contribute values strictly between π(i−1) and π(i), giving d_i = 1 + (m − 2) = m − 1. The most recent true neighbor in value of m is m − 1, which appears at index 2m − 3, so t_i = 2. Therefore r_{2m−1} = min(d_i + t_i, i) = min(m + 1, 2m − 1) = m + 1.

For i = 2m ≥ 2, we have π(i) = n/2 + m and π(i−1) = m. Among earlier indices, the even ones 2,4,…,2m − 2 (there are m − 1 of them) contribute values strictly between, so d_i = 1 + (m − 1) = m. The most recent true neighbor in value of n/2 + m is n/2 + (m − 1) at index 2m − 2, so t_i = 2. Hence r_{2m} = min(m + 2, 2m) = m + 2.

Thus

Reg_log(π) = ∑_{m=1}^{n/2} [log(1 + r_{2m−1}) + log(1 + r_{2m})]
= ∑_{m=1}^{n/2} [log(2 + m) + log(3 + m)] = Θ(n log n).

Therefore Reg_log(π)/MST_log^{(∞)}(π) = Θ(log n). Since a constant-factor reverse inequality would force the ratio to be O(1) uniformly in n, no such constant exists.

Finally, for any fixed norm ||·||, the same construction yields MST_log^{||·||}(π) = Θ(n) (use the same spanning tree; each (2,1) step has constant ||·||-length, while one bridge contributes O(log n)), and the above Reg_log lower bound is norm-independent. Hence Reg_log(π)/MST_log^{||·||}(π) = Θ(log n) in any fixed norm. ∎


Proposition 4 (Universal logarithmic reverse bound). For any fixed norm ||·|| on R^2 there exists α>0 such that ||z|| ≥ α||z||_∞ for all z. Consequently, for all π,

Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1 + n)/log(1 + α)) · MST_log^{||·||}(π).

Proof.
Since ||·|| ≥ α||·||_∞ for some α>0 (norm equivalence), any edge in the MST has length at least α (because ||·||_∞ ≥ 1 on any difference between two distinct permutation points), hence weight at least log(1 + α). Therefore MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≥ (n − 1)·log(1 + α).

On the other hand, r_i ≤ i for all i, so Reg_log(π) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n log(1 + i) ≤ (n − 1)·log(1 + n). Dividing yields the claim. ∎


Remarks.
- Theorems 1 and 3 together resolve the asymptotic dominance questions: Reg dominates MST (exactly in L∞ and within a universal constant factor for any fixed norm), while MST does not dominate Reg (worst-case gap Θ(log n)). Proposition 4 shows this Θ(log n) gap is optimal in order.
- Explicit constants can be tracked for common norms. For L_p in R^2, sup_{z} ||z||_p/||z||_∞ = 2^{1/p}, so Corollary 2 gives MST_log^{(p)} ≤ (1 + (log 2)/(p·log 3)) · Reg_log. In Proposition 4, one may take α = 1 (L∞), α = √2 (L2), α = 2 (L1), yielding per-edge lower weights log 2, log(1 + √2), log 3, respectively.
