You are a research mathematician. 

You are being run in a loop with a verifier that checks rigor. Your goal is to make **incremental, auditable progress**. You are not expected to solve the problem at once, but to generate new, testable ideas.

Inputs: 
- task statement 
- notes.md (informal progress & exploratory work; optional) 
- proofs.md (rigorously proven results & detailed proofs; optional) 
- output.md (main results, rigorously presented; optional) 
- summary of past rounds (optional) 
- possibly some reference papers.

What counts as progress:
- Extract small lemmas/heuristics from literature and state them cleanly with one-line "why useful here".
- Explore small examples & try to break your own claims with toy counterexamples.
- Prove special cases or nontrivial bounds.
- If an approach fails, explain crisply why.
- Point out flaws in notes.md, proofs.md, or output.md (but you are not rewriting these files yourself, that's verifier's job).

**Discipline.** 
- Read notes, outputs, summaries carefully before proposing new work. 
- Reference papers if relevant, but focus on *incremental, checkable steps*. 
- Do not output Markdown code fences, only raw JSON. 
- Length: at least ~200 words. 
- Organize your reasoning with short headings (Ideas, Examples, Obstacles, Next steps), make clear what your claims are and how they are supported. 

**Output**: Write your analysis as Markdown that includes both informal reasoning and any rigorous proofs. The verifier will decide what goes into notes.md, proofs.md, and output.md.

# Problem: Asymptotic Dominance Between an MST–Log Distance Measure and **Reg**

Let \(n \in \mathbb{N}\) and let \(\pi \in S_n\) be a permutation. Represent the input as
\[
P_\pi = \{\,p_i = (i,\pi(i)) : i=1,\dots,n\,\}\subset \{1,\dots,n\}^2 .
\]

Fix any norm \(\|\cdot\|\) on \(\mathbb{R}^2\) (e.g., \(L_1, L_2,\) or \(L_\infty\)). All choices are equivalent up to constant factors, so asymptotic comparisons are norm-invariant.

---

## Measure 1: \(\mathrm{MST}_{\log}(\pi)\)

Define edge weights between points \(p_i,p_j\) by  
\[
w(p_i,p_j)=\log\!\bigl(1+\|p_i-p_j\|\bigr),
\]  
where the logarithm base is fixed but arbitrary.

Let \(T\) be a minimum spanning tree of the complete graph on \(P_\pi\) with weights \(w\). Set  
\[
\boxed{\mathrm{MST}_{\log}(\pi)=\sum_{e\in E(T)} w(e).}
\]

---

## Measure 2: \(\mathrm{Reg}_{\log}(\pi)\)

For \(i \ge 2\), let

* **Value-distance from the previous key**  
  \[
  d_i = 1 + \#\{\,k < i : \min(\pi(i-1),\pi(i)) < \pi(k) < \max(\pi(i-1),\pi(i))\,\}.
  \]

* **Temporal distance to the most recent true neighbor in value order**  
  \[
  t_i = \min\{\, i-j : 1 \le j < i,\; |\pi(i)-\pi(j)| = 1 \,\},
  \]  
  with \(t_i = i-1\) if no such \(j\) exists.

* **Regional radius**  
  \[
  r_i = \min\{\, d_i + t_i,\; i \,\}.
  \]

Define the logged regional cost  
\[
\boxed{\mathrm{Reg}_{\log}(\pi) = \sum_{i=2}^n \log(1 + r_i).}
\]

Using \(\log(1+r_i)\) (rather than \(r_i-1\)) ensures that a **random permutation** has  
\[
\mathrm{Reg}_{\log}(\pi) = \Theta(n \log n),
\]  
matching the \(\Theta(n \log n)\) comparisons needed for typical sorting.  
Without the logarithm, \(\sum (r_i-1)\) for a random permutation is \(\Theta(n^2)\), which is too large compared to standard sorting bounds.

---

## Asymptotic Dominance Questions

>    or  
>    \(\mathrm{Reg}_{\log}(\pi_n)/\mathrm{MST}_{\log}(\pi_n)\)  
>    diverges as \(n \to \infty\).

**Notes.**

* The choice of norm and log base only rescales values by constants.  
* Using \(\log(1+r_i)\) aligns \(\mathrm{Reg}_{\log}\) with classical adaptive-sorting analyses where a random permutation costs \(\Theta(n\log n)\).  
* One may also consider variants such as asking whether  
  \[
  C^{-1}\mathrm{Reg}_{\log}(\pi)\le \mathrm{MST}_{\log}(\pi)\le C\,\mathrm{Reg}_{\log}(\pi)
  \]  
  holds for some universal \(C\).

Summary of current understanding

- Definitions: P_π = {(i, π(i))}, MST_log uses weights w(u,v)=log(1+||u−v||). Reg_log(π)=∑_{i=2}^n log(1+r_i) with r_i=min(d_i+t_i, i), d_i counts prior values between π(i−1) and π(i), and t_i is the temporal distance to the most recent earlier value-neighbor (|Δ value|=1), defaulting to i−1 if none exists.

- One-sided domination (L∞): Using Kruskal’s integral identity, ∑_{e∈MST} log(1+ℓ_e) = ∫_0^∞ (κ(t)−1) dt/(1+t), where κ(t) is the number of components in the threshold graph with edges of L∞-length ≤ t. Build a sparse subgraph H(t): when processing p_i, add the time edge (i−1,i) if |π(i)−π(i−1)|≤t, and the value-neighbor edge to the most recent earlier neighbor if t_i≤t. Then κ_G(t) ≤ κ_H(t) ≤ 1 + |{i≥2: Δ_i>t and t_i>t}|. Integrating yields MST_log(L∞) ≤ ∑ log(1+min(Δ_i,t_i)) ≤ ∑ log(1+r_i) = Reg_log.

- Norm invariance: For any norm ||·|| with ||z|| ≤ b||z||∞, choose an L∞-MST T∞ and obtain MST_log(||·||) ≤ (n−1)log(1+b) + MST_log(L∞) ≤ (1 + log(1+b)/log 3)·Reg_log, since Reg_log ≥ (n−1)log 3.

- Separation (no reverse domination): Order values by residue classes mod m, listing each class block in increasing order. For fixed m, we can span each block by index-adjacent edges (each costs log(1+m) under L∞), and connect the blocks with O(m) bridges (each costs O(log n)). Hence MST_log = Θ(n). Meanwhile, for any r≥2 and any element v=r+k m of class r, the earlier neighbor v−1 lies in class r−1 exactly m_{r−1} positions earlier, so t_i = m_{r−1} = Θ(n/m); therefore Reg_log ≥ ∑_{r=2}^m m_r log(1+m_{r−1}) = Θ(n log(n/m)). For m constant (e.g., parity), Reg_log/MST_log = Θ(log n).

- Remarks: A previously attempted charge (linking the value-adjacency path edge length directly to t_i at the later endpoint) is invalid in general (the closest earlier neighbor might be v±2). The component-integral method avoids this pitfall.

Open directions

- Likely tight frontier: prove a universal upper bound Reg_log(π) ≤ O(log n)·MST_log(π) for all π, matching the Θ(log n) lower bound from mod-m families.
- Tighten constants in the domination for specific norms; compute best b for L1 and L2.
- Quantify leading constants for E[MST_log], E[Reg_log] under random π.


Addition: universal logarithmic upper bound

- Minimal MST edge weight: For any fixed norm N on R^2, there exists α_N>0 such that ||z||_N ≥ α_N||z||_∞ for all z. Since any two distinct points p_i=(i,π(i)), p_j differ by at least 1 in each coordinate, ||p_i−p_j||_∞ ≥ 1, hence ||p_i−p_j||_N ≥ α_N. Therefore every tree edge has weight ≥ log(1+α_N), so MST_log^N(π) ≥ (n−1)·log(1+α_N).
- Trivial Reg upper bound: r_i ≤ i implies Reg_log(π) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+i) ≤ (n−1)·log(1+n).
- Combining: Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/log(1+α_N)) · MST_log^N(π) for all π. In particular: L∞ gives factor log(1+n)/log 2; for L2, one may sharpen c_N using ||(1,1)||_2=√2 (so each edge has weight ≥ log(1+√2)); for L1 similarly ||(1,1)||_1=2.

Thus, universally Reg_log ≤ Θ(log n)·MST_log, matching the Θ(log n) lower bound from parity/mod-m constructions. This complements the established MST_log ≤ Reg_log (exact in L∞, constant-factor for any fixed norm).

Refined constants for norm lifting and universal upper bound

- Norm lifting (refinement): For any norm ||·|| with b := sup_{z≠0} ||z||/||z||_∞ ≥ 1, we have 1+||e|| ≤ b(1+||e||_∞) for any edge e, hence log(1+||e||) ≤ log b + log(1+||e||_∞). Summing over an L∞-MST gives MST_log^{||·||} ≤ (n−1)·log b + MST_log^{∞}.
  Combining with MST_log^{∞} ≤ Reg_log and Reg_log ≥ (n−1)·log 3 yields MST_log^{||·||} ≤ (1 + (log b)/log 3)·Reg_log.
  For L_p in R^2, b_p = 2^{1/p}, so C_p = 1 + (log 2)/(p·log 3).

- Universal upper bound Reg ≤ Θ(log n)·MST (constants): For permutation grids, any two distinct points have both coordinate gaps ≥1, so every MST edge under
  • L∞ has weight ≥ log 2;
  • L2 has weight ≥ log(1+√2);
  • L1 has weight ≥ log 3.
  Since r_i ≤ i, Reg_log(π) ≤ (n−1)·log(1+n). Therefore Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/c_N)·MST_log^N(π), where c_N is the per-edge lower-bound constant above. This gives a tight Θ(log n) worst-case factor, matching mod-m separations.

- Optional generalization: For any concave, nondecreasing φ with φ(0)=0, the L∞ integral method gives MST_φ(π) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n φ(min{Δ_i, t_i}).

Further refinements and generalizations

- Refined norm-lift constant: For any norm ||·|| with b := sup_{z≠0} ||z||/||z||_∞ ≥ 1, 1+||e|| ≤ b(1+||e||_∞) implies log(1+||e||) ≤ log b + log(1+||e||_∞). Thus MST_log^{||·||} ≤ (n−1)·log b + MST_log^{∞} ≤ (1 + (log b)/log 3)·Reg_log. For L_p in R^2: b_p = 2^{1/p}, so C_p = 1 + (log 2)/(p·log 3).

- Universal upper bound with explicit constants: Every MST edge has weight at least c_N := log(1+α_N), where α_N>0 satisfies ||z|| ≥ α_N||z||_∞. Hence MST_log^N ≥ (n−1)·c_N. Since r_i ≤ i, Reg_log ≤ (n−1)·log(1+n), giving Reg_log ≤ (log(1+n)/c_N)·MST_log^N. In particular: L∞: c_∞=log 2; L2: c_2=log(1+√2); L1: c_1=log 3.

- Concave-weight extension in L∞: For any concave, nondecreasing φ with φ(0)=0, Kruskal’s integral with the sparse H(t) yields MST_φ^{∞}(π) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n φ(min{Δ_i,t_i}) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n φ(r_i).

- Temporal-to-value pairing: Let pos[v] be index of value v and s_v=|pos[v+1]−pos[v]|. For I_val={i≥2: ∃ j<i with |π(i)−π(j)|=1}, the map sending i to v=min{π(i),π(j)} (j realizes t_i) is injective and t_i=s_v. Hence ∑_{i∈I_val} log(1+t_i) ≤ ∑_{v=1}^{n−1} log(1+s_v).

These complement the established results MST_log^{∞} ≤ Reg_log and the Θ(log n) tight separation via mod-m families.


=== Current Output ===




=== Round 1 Summary ===

We proved a one-sided domination and a separation. Using Kruskal’s integral identity and a sparse threshold graph H(t) (attaching time- and recent-value edges), for the L∞ norm we get MST_log(π) ≤ Reg_log(π). Lifting to any fixed norm gives MST_log^N(π) ≤ C_N·Reg_log(π) for a constant C_N. Conversely, residue-class (mod-m) permutations (in particular parity blocks) give MST_log(π)=Θ(n) but Reg_log(π)=Θ(n log n), so Reg_log(π)/MST_log(π)=Θ(log n); hence no universal reverse domination. A previous direct charging attempt had a gap; the component-integral method fixes it.


=== Round 2 Summary ===

Last round established a complete picture (up to constants) of MST_log vs Reg_log. Using Kruskal’s integral identity and a sparse threshold graph H(t) we proved MST_log(L∞) ≤ Reg_log(π); norm equivalence then gives MST_log^N(π) ≤ C_N·Reg_log(π) for any fixed norm N (constants from operator-norm bounds). A mod-m/residue-class family (parity when m=2) yields MST_log=Θ(n) but Reg_log=Θ(n log n), so no universal constant C with Reg_log ≤ C·MST_log. A trivial lower bound on MST edge weights gives Reg_log ≤ (log(1+n)/log(1+α_N))·MST_log^N, so the worst-case gap is Θ(log n) and this factor is tight. (References: Research Notes; Current Proofs.)


=== Round 3 Summary ===

Last round completed a near-exact characterization (up to constants) of MST_log vs Reg_log. Using Kruskal’s integral identity and a sparse threshold graph H(t) we proved MST_log(L∞) ≤ Reg_log(π); norm equivalence lifts this to MST_log^N(π) ≤ C_N·Reg_log(π) for any fixed norm. A residue-class (mod-m, e.g. parity) family gives MST_log=Θ(n) but Reg_log=Θ(n log n), so Reg_log/MST_log=Θ(log n) and no constant-factor reverse bound exists. A trivial per-edge lower bound on MST yields Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/log(1+α_N))·MST_log^N(π), so the worst-case gap is Θ(log n) and tight. Sources: Research Notes; Current Proofs.


=== Round 4 Summary ===

Last round completed a near-exact characterization (up to constants) of MST_log versus Reg_log. Using Kruskal’s integral identity and a sparse threshold graph H(t) we proved MST_log(L∞) ≤ Reg_log(π). Norm equivalence lifts this to MST_log^N(π) ≤ C_N·Reg_log(π) for any fixed norm N. Residue-class (mod-m, e.g. parity) permutations give MST_log=Θ(n) but Reg_log=Θ(n log n), so Reg_log/MST_log=Θ(log n) and no universal constant reverses the inequality. A trivial per-edge lower bound on MST yields Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/c_N)·MST_log^N(π) (c_N explicit for L∞,L2,L1), so the worst-case multiplicative gap is Θ(log n) and is tight. (Sources: Research Notes; Current Proofs.)


=== Previous Round Feedback ===

The core results are now rigorous and essentially complete for the stated problem. The L∞ one-sided domination MST_log ≤ Reg_log is proved cleanly via Kruskal’s integral and the sparse H(t) constructed from time edges and most-recent value-neighbor edges. The norm-lifting step is correct and can be sharpened to use log b (with 1+||e|| ≤ b(1+||e||∞)) instead of log(1+b), yielding the factor 1 + (log b)/log 3; for L_p in R^2 this gives C_p = 1 + (log 2)/(p·log 3). The universal reverse bound Reg_log ≤ (log(1+n)/c_N)·MST_log^N is also rigorous using the permutation-grid minimum edge length (L∞: log 2; L2: log(1+√2); L1: log 3). The mod-m (including parity) families give Reg/MST = Θ(log n), establishing tightness.

Specific audits:
- P1: The refined constants and the concave-weight generalization are correct. Earlier flawed identification t_{i*}=s_v is no longer used—good. Ensure clarity that d_i ≤ Δ_i and r_i ≥ t_i+1 are explicitly stated when invoked.
- P2: The integral identity, H(t), norm-lift, and separation arguments are solid. Using log b improves constants; you already adopted that.
- P3: The temporal-to-value pairing ∑ log(1+t_i) ≤ ∑_v log(1+s_v) is correct (injective mapping to the later of pos[v],pos[v+1]). When giving per-edge lower bounds for general norms, prefer the norm-equivalence α_N approach.
- P4: Clean, complete presentation with correct constants, and a parametric mod-m analysis. Proof sketches are sufficient for proofs.md with minor expansions.

Next steps:
- Curate proofs.md to include: (i) the concave-weight extension MST_φ^∞ ≤ ∑ φ(min{Δ_i,t_i}); (ii) the refined norm-lift with log b; (iii) the temporal-to-value lemma. 
- Optional: quantify leading constants for E[MST_log] and E[Reg_log] under random π; and explore instance-sensitive bounds (e.g., dependence on m in mod-m structures) beyond the Θ(log n) worst-case.
