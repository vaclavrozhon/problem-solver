A residue-class (mod-m, e.g. parity) permutation family gives MST_log=\u0398(n) but Reg_log=\u0398(n log n), so Reg_log/MST_log=\u0398(log n) and no universal constant reverses the inequality. A trivial per-edge lower bound on MST yields Reg_log(\u03c0) \u2264 (log(1+n)/c_N)\u00b7MST_log^N(\u03c0), so the worst-case multiplicative gap is \u0398(log n) and is tight.
