{"summary_md":"Using Kruskal’s integral identity and a sparse threshold graph H(t) we proved MST_log(π) ≤ Reg_log(π) for the L∞ norm; norm equivalence lifts this to MST_log^N(π) ≤ C_N·Reg_log(π) for any fixed norm. A residue-class (mod-m, e.g. parity) permutation family gives MST_log=Θ(n) but Reg_log=Θ(n log n), so Reg_log/MST_log=Θ(log n) and no universal constant reverses the inequality. A trivial per-edge lower bound on MST yields Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/c_N)·MST_log^N(π), so the worst-case multiplicative gap is Θ(log n) and is tight.
