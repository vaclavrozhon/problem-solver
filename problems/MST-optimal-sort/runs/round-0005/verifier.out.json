  "feedback_md": "We can now present a complete, rigorous resolution of the three questions and have written a self-contained proof into output.md. The core engine is the Kruskal integral identity specialized to log(1+distance), coupled with a sparse threshold subgraph H(t) that only uses two local edge types: (i) time-adjacent (i\u22121,i) when \u0394_i\u2264t, and (ii) the most recent value-neighbor when t_i\u2264t. This yields, in L\u221e, MST_log \u2264 \u2211 log(1+min{\u0394_i,t_i}) \u2264 Reg_log, with a fully justified component-count bound \u03ba_G(t) \u2264 1 + |{i\u22652: \u0394_i>t and t_i>t}|. Lifting to any norm uses the refined inequality 1+||e|| \u2264 b(1+||e||\u221e) and Reg_log \u2265 (n\u22121)log 3, giving MST_log^||\u00b7|| \u2264 (1 + (log b)/log 3)\u00b7Reg_log, with explicit constants for L_p (C_p = 1 + (log 2)/(p\u00b7log 3)).\n\nFor the reverse direction, we provide a tight family (parity blocks) with MST_log = \u0398(n) and Reg_log = \u0398(n log n), hence no constant-factor domination of Reg by MST. We also show the universal upper bound Reg_log \u2264 (log(1+n)/c_N)\u00b7MST_log^N via the minimal per-edge weight of any spanning tree in a permutation grid (explicit constants for L\u221e/L2/L1). Thus the worst-case multiplicative gap is \u0398(log n), and this is optimal.\n\nAuditing details: (i) The earlier flawed identification t_{i*}=s_v is no longer used. (ii) The component integral and H(t) construction are sound; the counting argument is correctly phrased so that components can only increase when both local edges are absent. (iii) The norm-lift constant is sharpened to log b (not log(1+b)), and Reg_log \u2265 (n\u22121)log 3 is used to absorb the additive term. (iv) The separation proof computes r_i and the MST tree cost explicitly and is correct for any fixed norm.\n\nNext steps (optional): quantify leading constants in E[MST_log] and E[Reg_log] under random \u03c0; and explore instance-sensitive bounds beyond the \u0398(log n) worst-case (e.g., mod-m structure).",

Fix a norm ||\u00b7|| on R^2 and a logarithm base (changing either only rescales constants). For u,v\u2208P_\u03c0 define the edge weight w(u,v)=log(1+||u\u2212v||). Let MST_log^{||\u00b7||}(\u03c0) be the total w-weight of a minimum spanning tree on P_\u03c0.\n\nFor i\u22652 define\n- \u0394_i := |\u03c0(i)\u2212\u03c0(i\u22121)|,\n- t_i := min{i\u2212j : 1\u2264j<i and |\u03c0(i)\u2212\u03c0(j)|=1}, with t_i := i\u22121 if no such j exists,\n- d_i := 1 + #{ k<i : min(\u03c0(i\u22121),\u03c0(i)) < \u03c0(k) < max(\u03c0(i\u22121),\u03c0(i)) },\n- r_i := min{ d_i + t_i, i }.\nSet Reg_log(\u03c0) := \u2211_{i=2}^n log(1+r_i). Note that for all i\u22652, d_i\u22651 and t_i\u22651, hence r_i\u22652 and log(1+r_i)\u2265log 3.\n\nWe write MST_log(\u03c0) for the L\u221e case (||\u00b7||=||\u00b7||_\u221e). The main results resolve the dominance questions up to optimal \u0398(log n) factors.\n\nTheorem 1 (Exact one-sided domination in L\u221e). For all permutations \u03c0,\nMST_log(\u03c0) \u2264 Reg_log(\u03c0).\n\nProof. For t\u22650, let G(t) be the graph on P_\u03c0 with an edge {u,v} whenever ||u\u2212v||_\u221e \u2264 t, and let \u03ba(t) be its number of connected components. For an MST whose L\u221e-edge lengths are {\u2113_e}, the layer-cake identity and Kruskal\u2019s algorithm give\nMST_log(\u03c0) = \u2211_e log(1+\u2113_e) = \u222b_0^\u221e #(e:\u2113_e>t) dt/(1+t) = \u222b_0^\u221e (\u03ba(t)\u22121) dt/(1+t).\n(The last equality holds for all t except ties, which form a measure-zero set.)\nWe upper bound \u03ba(t) via a sparse subgraph H(t). Process i=2,\u2026,n and add to H(t):\n- the time edge (i\u22121,i) if \u0394_i \u2264 t;\n- the value-neighbor edge (i,j), where j<i is the largest index with |\u03c0(i)\u2212\u03c0(j)|=1, if t_i \u2264 t.\nEach added edge has L\u221e-length \u2264 t (time: ||p_i\u2212p_{i\u22121}||_\u221e=max{1,\u0394_i}; value: ||p_i\u2212p_j||_\u221e=max{1,t_i}). Hence H(t)\u2286G(t), so \u03ba(t)\u2264\u03ba_H(t). Expose vertices in increasing i. When i arrives, \u03ba_H increases by 1 (for the new vertex) and decreases by 1 if at least one of the two edges is present (the vertex attaches to previous vertices), and possibly decreases further if both are present (merging two components). Thus the component count fails to drop back by 1 only if both edges are absent, i.e., if \u0394_i>t and t_i>t. Starting from \u03ba_H(1)=1 we obtain\n\u03ba(t) \u2264 \u03ba_H(t) \u2264 1 + |{ i\u2208{2,\u2026,n} : \u0394_i>t and t_i>t }|.\nIntegrating,\nMST_log(\u03c0) \u2264 \u222b_0^\u221e \u2211_{i=2}^n 1[\u0394_i>t and t_i>t] dt/(1+t) = \u2211_{i=2}^n log(1+min{\u0394_i,t_i}).\nFinally, since r_i=min{d_i+t_i,i} and t_i\u2264i\u22121, we have r_i\u2265t_i. Hence log(1+min{\u0394_i,t_i}) \u2264 log(1+t_i) \u2264 log(1+r_i). Summing over i gives MST_log(\u03c0) \u2264 Reg_log(\u03c0).\n\u220e\n\nCorollary 2 (Domination for any norm; explicit constant). Let b:=sup_{||z||_\u221e=1} ||z|| \u2208 [1,\u221e). Then for all \u03c0,\nMST_log^{||\u00b7||}(\u03c0) \u2264 (1 + (log b)/log 3) \u00b7 Reg_log(\u03c0).\n\nProof. Let T_\u221e be an L\u221e-MST. For any edge e, 1+||e|| \u2264 b(1+||e||_\u221e), so log(1+||e||) \u2264 log b + log(1+||e||_\u221e). Summing over the n\u22121 edges of T_\u221e,\nMST_log^{||\u00b7||}(\u03c0) \u2264 (n\u22121)\u00b7log b + MST_log(\u03c0) \u2264 (n\u22121)\u00b7log b + Reg_log(\u03c0).\nSince Reg_log(\u03c0) \u2265 (n\u22121)\u00b7log 3, the additive term is absorbed to yield the stated factor. For L_p in R^2 one has b=2^{1/p}, giving MST_log^{(p)}(\u03c0) \u2264 (1 + (log 2)/(p\u00b7log 3))\u00b7Reg_log(\u03c0).\n\u220e\n\nTheorem 3 (Universal logarithmic reverse bound). For any fixed norm ||\u00b7|| there exists c>0 such that for all \u03c0 and n,\nReg_log(\u03c0) \u2264 (log(1+n)/c) \u00b7 MST_log^{||\u00b7||}(\u03c0).\n\nProof. In a permutation grid, any two distinct points have both coordinate gaps \u22651. Thus every spanning-tree edge has length at least \u03b1 and weight at least c:=log(1+\u03b1), with \u03b1=1,\u221a2,2 respectively in L\u221e, L2, L1. More generally, by norm equivalence there is \u03b1>0 with ||z|| \u2265 \u03b1||z||_\u221e, hence every edge length is \u2265\u03b1. Therefore MST_log^{||\u00b7||}(\u03c0) \u2265 (n\u22121)\u00b7c. On the other hand r_i\u2264i implies Reg_log(\u03c0) \u2264 \u2211_{i=2}^n log(1+i) \u2264 (n\u22121)\u00b7log(1+n). Dividing yields the claim.\n\u220e\n\nTheorem 4 (Separation; no reverse constant). There is no universal C with Reg_log(\u03c0) \u2264 C\u00b7MST_log^{||\u00b7||}(\u03c0) for all \u03c0. In fact, for any fixed norm, there exist permutations with Reg_log/MST_log = \u0398(log n).\n\nProof. Take the parity-block permutation for even n: list all even values in increasing order, then all odd values in increasing order; i.e., \u03c0(i)=2i for 1\u2264i\u2264n/2 and \u03c0(i)=2(i\u2212n/2)\u22121 for i>n/2.\nMST_log^{||\u00b7||}(\u03c0)=\u0398(n): within each half, the time edges (i\u22121,i) have constant length, contributing \u0398(n); one bridge connects the halves, costing O(log n). A matching \u03a9(n) lower bound holds since every MST has n\u22121 edges of weight \u2265c>0 (Theorem 3), so MST_log^{||\u00b7||}(\u03c0)=\u0398(n).\nReg_log(\u03c0)=\u0398(n log n): in the first half (even block), no odd has appeared, so for 2\u2264i\u2264n/2 one has t_i=i\u22121 and d_i=1, hence r_i=i and \u2211_{i=2}^{n/2} log(1+r_i)=\u0398((n/2)\u00b7log n). In the second half (odd block), the nearest value-neighbor lies in the first half at temporal distance t_i=n/2 for all but the first odd, and d_i=2 (the unique even between consecutive odds has appeared), hence r_i=\u0398(n) for almost all i, contributing \u0398(log n) each; the first odd has r_i=\u0398(n) as well. Thus the odd block contributes \u0398((n/2)\u00b7log n). Summing gives Reg_log(\u03c0)=\u0398(n log n). Therefore Reg_log/MST_log=\u0398(log n).\n\u220e\n\nConsequences. Theorems 1\u20134 resolve the dominance questions:\n- Reg dominates MST: MST_log(\u03c0) \u2264 Reg_log(\u03c0) in L\u221e, and MST_log^{||\u00b7||}(\u03c0) \u2264 (1 + (log b)/log 3)\u00b7Reg_log(\u03c0) for any fixed norm.\n- MST does not dominate Reg by a constant: there are permutations with Reg_log/MST_log = \u0398(log n).\n- Universal upper bound: for all \u03c0, Reg_log(\u03c0) \u2264 (log(1+n)/c)\u00b7MST_log^{||\u00b7||}(\u03c0).\nHence the worst-case gap is \u0398(log n) and this is optimal. All constants depend only on the norm and the log base."
