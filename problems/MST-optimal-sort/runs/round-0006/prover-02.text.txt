# Asymptotic comparison between MST_log and Reg_log

We fix a logarithm base throughout (changing the base rescales all values by a constant factor). For a permutation π∈S_n define the point set
P_π = { p_i = (i, π(i)) : i=1,…,n } ⊂ R^2.
Fix a norm ∥·∥ on R^2. For distinct u,v∈P_π set the edge weight w(u,v)=log(1+∥u−v∥). Let MST_log^{∥·∥}(π) be the total w-weight of a minimum spanning tree on P_π.

For i≥2 set
- Δ_i := |π(i)−π(i−1)|,
- t_i := min{ i−j : 1≤j<i and |π(i)−π(j)|=1 }, with t_i := i−1 if the set is empty,
- d_i := 1 + #{ k<i : min(π(i−1),π(i)) < π(k) < max(π(i−1),π(i)) },
- r_i := min{ d_i + t_i, i }.
Define Reg_log(π) := ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+r_i).

We prove three statements: (1) MST_log ≤ C·Reg_log for some norm-dependent constant C>0 (with C=1 for L∞); (2) no reverse constant bound holds; (3) nevertheless Reg_log ≤ O(log n)·MST_log, with explicit constants, and this is tight up to constants.


Definitions for threshold graphs. For a metric space (X,d) and t≥0, define G(t) on X with edges {u,v} whenever d(u,v) ≤ t. Write κ(t) for the number of connected components of G(t).


Lemma 1 (Kruskal’s integral identity for log-weights).
Let X be finite, d a metric, and T an MST of the complete graph on X with edge weights log(1+d). If the MST edge-lengths are ℓ_1≤⋯≤ℓ_{|X|−1}, then
∑_{e∈T} log(1+ℓ_e) = ∫_0^∞ (κ(t)−1) dt/(1+t),
where κ(t) is the number of components in G(t).

Proof. For each j, log(1+ℓ_j)=∫_0^{ℓ_j} dt/(1+t). Summing and interchanging sum and integral gives ∫_0^∞ m(t) dt/(1+t), where m(t):=|{j: ℓ_j≥t}|. By Kruskal’s algorithm, after inserting all edges of length ≤ t the partial forest has κ(t) components, hence exactly κ(t)−1 MST edges have length > t, i.e., m(t)=κ(t)−1 for all t except a (finite) set of tie-thresholds, which does not affect the integral. ∎


Theorem 1 (Exact one-sided domination in L∞).
For all permutations π,
MST_log^{∞}(π) ≤ Reg_log(π).

Proof. Apply Lemma 1 with X=P_π and d=∥·∥_∞. For t≥0 construct a sparse subgraph H(t)⊆G(t) as follows. Process i=1,…,n; when adding p_i:
- if Δ_i ≤ t, add the time edge {p_{i−1},p_i}; note ∥p_i−p_{i−1}∥_∞ = max{1,Δ_i} = Δ_i,
- if there exists j<i with |π(i)−π(j)|=1 and t_i=i−j ≤ t, add the value-neighbor edge {p_j,p_i}; note ∥p_i−p_j∥_∞ = max{ |i−j|, |π(i)−π(j)| } = max{ t_i, 1 } = t_i.
Thus H(t)⊆G(t). Expose vertices in increasing i. Adding vertex p_i increases κ_H by 1; if at least one of the two edges is present then p_i attaches to earlier vertices, so κ_H decreases by ≥1 (and possibly by 2 if both were present and incident to different components); if neither edge is present (i.e., Δ_i>t and t_i>t) κ_H does not decrease. Hence
κ(t) ≤ κ_H(t) ≤ 1 + |{ i∈{2,…,n} : Δ_i>t and t_i>t }|.
By Lemma 1,
MST_log^{∞}(π) = ∫_0^∞ (κ(t)−1) dt/(1+t) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n ∫_0^{min{Δ_i,t_i}} dt/(1+t) = ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+min{Δ_i,t_i}).
Since r_i=min{d_i+t_i, i} and t_i≤i−1, we have r_i≥t_i, thus log(1+min{Δ_i,t_i}) ≤ log(1+t_i) ≤ log(1+r_i). Summing over i proves MST_log^{∞}(π) ≤ Reg_log(π). ∎


Corollary 2 (Domination for any norm; explicit constant).
Let ∥·∥ be any norm on R^2 and b:=sup_{∥z∥_∞=1} ∥z∥ ∈ [1,∞). Then for all π,
MST_log^{∥·∥}(π) ≤ (1 + (log b)/log 3) · Reg_log(π).

Proof. Let T_∞ be an L∞-MST. For any edge e, 1+∥e∥ ≤ b(1+∥e∥_∞), hence log(1+∥e∥) ≤ log b + log(1+∥e∥_∞). Summing over e∈T_∞ yields
MST_log^{∥·∥}(π) ≤ (n−1)·log b + MST_log^{∞}(π) ≤ (n−1)·log b + Reg_log(π),
by Theorem 1. Since for all i≥2, d_i≥1 and t_i≥1, we have r_i≥2 and thus Reg_log(π) ≥ ∑_{i=2}^n log 3 = (n−1)·log 3. Absorb the additive term to obtain the stated factor. For L_p on R^2, b=2^{1/p}, giving MST_log^{(p)}(π) ≤ (1 + (log 2)/(p·log 3))·Reg_log(π). ∎


Theorem 3 (Universal logarithmic reverse bound).
For any norm ∥·∥ on R^2 there exists c>0 depending only on the norm such that for all n and π,
Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/c) · MST_log^{∥·∥}(π).

Proof. For any distinct p_i,p_j, we have |i−j|≥1 and (since π is a permutation) |π(i)−π(j)|≥1. Thus every spanning-tree edge e has both coordinate gaps at least 1 in absolute value. Let
β := inf{ ∥(x,y)∥ : x≥1, y≥1 } > 0,
which is positive by continuity and positive-definiteness of ∥·∥. Then ∥e∥ ≥ β and each edge weight is ≥ c:=log(1+β). Therefore MST_log^{∥·∥}(π) ≥ (n−1)·c.
On the other hand r_i ≤ i implies Reg_log(π) = ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+r_i) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+i) ≤ (n−1)·log(1+n). Dividing gives the claim. For L∞, L2, L1 one may take β=1, √2, 2, hence c=log 2, log(1+√2), log 3 respectively. ∎


Theorem 4 (Separation; no reverse constant domination).
Fix any norm ∥·∥. There is no universal constant C such that Reg_log(π) ≤ C·MST_log^{∥·∥}(π) for all π and n. In fact, there exists a family of permutations with Reg_log(π)/MST_log^{∥·∥}(π) = Θ(log n).

Proof. Consider the “residue-class” permutations: fix m≥2, and define π^{(m)}_n by listing values by residue classes mod m in increasing residue order and increasing within each class:
π^{(m)}_n = (1,1+m,1+2m, …; 2,2+m,2+2m, …; …; m,2m,3m, …), truncated at n.
Let m_r be the size of residue class r (r=1,…,m), so m_r∈{⌊n/m⌋,⌈n/m⌉} and ∑_r m_r=n.

MST upper bound (L∞). The indices of each class form a contiguous block. Within class r, connect consecutive indices by time edges; each such edge has L∞-length ∥(1,Δ)∥_∞=max{1,Δ}=m and weight log(1+m). Summing over all classes gives (n−m)·log(1+m). Connect the m class-blocks by m−1 boundary time edges; each such edge has L∞-length O(n), hence weight O(log n), totaling O(m log n). Therefore
MST_log^{∞}(π^{(m)}_n) ≤ (n−m)·log(1+m) + (m−1)·O(log n) = Θ(n + m log n).
By Theorem 3, MST_log^{∞}(π^{(m)}_n) = Ω(n), so for fixed m this is Θ(n). By norm equivalence, MST_log^{∥·∥}(π^{(m)}_n) = Θ(n) as well (for fixed m).

Reg lower bound. Fix r≥2. For the k-th element of class r, its value is v=r+km. Its most recent earlier true neighbor is v−1=r−1+km provided v−1≤n; this element lies in class r−1 and appears exactly m_{r−1} steps earlier, so t_i=m_{r−1}. If v−1>n, then no earlier neighbor exists and t_i=i−1 ≥ ∑_{s<r} m_s ≥ m_{r−1}. In all cases t_i ≥ m_{r−1}. Thus r_i ≥ t_i, so log(1+r_i) ≥ log(1+m_{r−1}). Summing over the m_r elements of class r and over r=2,…,m yields
Reg_log(π^{(m)}_n) ≥ ∑_{r=2}^m m_r·log(1+m_{r−1}) = Θ(n log(n/m)).
For fixed m, this is Θ(n log n). Hence Reg_log/MST_log = Θ(log n), so no universal constant C can satisfy Reg_log ≤ C·MST_log. ∎


Conclusion. For any fixed norm on R^2 and all permutations π,
- MST dominates by Reg: MST_log^{∥·∥}(π) ≤ C_∥·∥·Reg_log(π), with C_∥·∥ = 1+(log b)/log 3 and b:=sup_{∥z∥_∞=1} ∥z∥ (in particular C_{∞}=1).
- No constant reverse domination holds: there exist permutations with Reg_log(π)/MST_log^{∥·∥}(π) = Θ(log n).
- Nevertheless, universally Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/c_∥·∥)·MST_log^{∥·∥}(π), with c_∥·∥>0 depending only on the norm (e.g., c_{∞}=log 2, c_2=log(1+√2), c_1=log 3).
Thus the worst-case multiplicative gap between Reg_log and MST_log is Θ(log n), and this is tight up to constant factors.
