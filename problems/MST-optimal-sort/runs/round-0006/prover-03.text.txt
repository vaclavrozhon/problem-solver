Asymptotic comparison between MST_log and Reg_log

Setup and definitions
- Fix an integer n≥2 and a permutation π∈S_n. Represent π by points P_π={p_i=(i,π(i)) : i=1,…,n}⊂R^2.
- Fix a norm ||·|| on R^2 and a logarithm base (changing either rescales all quantities by fixed positive constants). For u,v∈P_π define w(u,v)=log(1+||u−v||).
- Let MST_log^{||·||}(π) be the total w-weight of a minimum spanning tree of the complete graph on P_π. For ||·||=||·||_∞ (L∞) write MST_log(π).
- For i≥2 set Δ_i:=|π(i)−π(i−1)| and t_i:=min{i−j : 1≤j<i, |π(i)−π(j)|=1}, with t_i:=i−1 if no such j exists. Let d_i:=1+# { k<i : min(π(i−1),π(i)) < π(k) < max(π(i−1),π(i)) }. Define r_i:=min{d_i+t_i, i} and Reg_log(π):=∑_{i=2}^n log(1+r_i). Note that for i≥2, d_i≥1 and t_i≥1, hence r_i≥2 and log(1+r_i)≥log 3.

Theorem 1 (Exact one-sided domination in L∞)
For every permutation π, MST_log(π) ≤ Reg_log(π).

Proof.
For t≥0, let G(t) be the graph on P_π with edge {u,v} whenever ||u−v||_∞ ≤ t, and let κ(t) be the number of connected components of G(t). If the L∞-lengths of the MST edges are {ℓ_e}, then
MST_log(π) = ∑_e log(1+ℓ_e) = ∫_0^∞ #(e: ℓ_e>t) dt/(1+t) = ∫_0^∞ (κ(t)−1) dt/(1+t),
where the last equality is the standard Kruskal identity (ties occur on a measure-zero set of t and do not affect the integral).
We upper bound κ(t) via a sparse subgraph H(t). Process i=2,…,n and, depending on t, add to H(t) at most one of the following edges:
- the time edge (p_{i−1},p_i) if Δ_i ≤ t;
- the value-neighbor edge (p_j,p_i), where j<i is the largest index with |π(i)−π(j)|=1, if t_i ≤ t.
In L∞, the length of (p_{i−1},p_i) is max{1,Δ_i} and the length of (p_j,p_i) is max{1,t_i}; hence whenever an edge is added its length is ≤ t, and therefore H(t)⊆G(t). Orient each added edge towards the smaller index; this produces a directed forest F(t) in which each vertex i≥2 has outdegree 0 or 1 and edges point from i to a smaller index. The number of components of H(t) (hence of G(t)) is at most the number of components of F(t), which equals 1 + |{ i∈{2,…,n} : no parent was assigned to i }|. By construction, no parent is assigned exactly when both Δ_i>t and t_i>t. Therefore
κ(t) ≤ 1 + |{ i≥2 : Δ_i>t and t_i>t }|.
Integrating,
MST_log(π) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n ∫_0^∞ 1[Δ_i>t and t_i>t] dt/(1+t) = ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+min{Δ_i,t_i}).
Since r_i = min{d_i+t_i, i} and t_i≤i−1 for i≥2, we have r_i≥t_i. Hence log(1+min{Δ_i,t_i}) ≤ log(1+t_i) ≤ log(1+r_i). Summing over i proves MST_log(π) ≤ Reg_log(π).
∎

Theorem 2 (Domination in any fixed norm)
Let ||·|| be any norm on R^2, and let b:=sup_{||z||_∞=1} ||z|| ∈ [1,∞). Then for all π,
MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ [1 + (log b)/log 3] · Reg_log(π).

Proof.
Let T_∞ be an L∞-MST. For any edge e, ||e|| ≤ b||e||_∞, hence 1+||e|| ≤ b(1+||e||_∞) and log(1+||e||) ≤ log b + log(1+||e||_∞). Summing over the n−1 edges of T_∞,
MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ (n−1)·log b + MST_log(π) ≤ (n−1)·log b + Reg_log(π).
Since Reg_log(π) ≥ (n−1)·log 3, the additive term is absorbed, yielding MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ [1 + (log b)/log 3] · Reg_log(π).
∎

Theorem 3 (Universal logarithmic reverse bound)
For any fixed norm ||·|| there exists c>0, depending only on ||·|| and the log base, such that for all π and n,
Reg_log(π) ≤ [log(1+n)/c] · MST_log^{||·||}(π).
In particular, one may take c=log 2 for L∞, c=log(1+√2) for L2, and c=log 3 for L1.

Proof.
In a permutation grid, for any distinct i≠j we have |i−j|≥1 and |π(i)−π(j)|≥1; thus every Euclidean edge length is at least √2, every L1 edge length at least 2, and every L∞ edge length at least 1. Therefore every MST edge has weight at least c:=log(1+α), with α=1,√2,2 in L∞, L2, L1 respectively. Hence MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≥ (n−1)·c. On the other hand r_i≤i gives Reg_log(π) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+i) ≤ (n−1)·log(1+n). Combining, Reg_log(π) ≤ [log(1+n)/c] · MST_log^{||·||}(π).
∎

Theorem 4 (Separation; tightness of the Θ(log n) gap)
There exists a family of permutations {π_n} such that for every fixed norm ||·||,
Reg_log(π_n) / MST_log^{||·||}(π_n) = Θ(log n).
In particular, there is no universal constant C with Reg_log(π) ≤ C·MST_log^{||·||}(π) for all π.

Proof.
Let n=2m and define π by listing all odd values then all even values:
π(i)=2i−1 for 1≤i≤m, and π(m+j)=2j for 1≤j≤m.
MST cost. In L∞, connect consecutive indices within each block and add a single bridge between the blocks. Within a block, ||p_{i+1}−p_i||_∞=max{1,2}=2, so each such edge has weight log 3; the bridge between p_m and p_{m+1} has L∞-length 2m−3 and weight log(2m−2). Hence MST_log(π) ≤ (n−2)·log 3 + log(n−2) = Θ(n). Since every MST has n−1 edges and each carries weight at least log 2, MST_log(π) ≥ (n−1)·log 2 = Ω(n). Thus MST_log(π)=Θ(n). The same construction shows MST_log^{||·||}(π)=Θ(n) for L1 and L2 (constant intra-block edge lengths and one bridge of length Θ(n)).
Reg cost. For 2≤i≤m (odd block), no earlier value-neighbor exists, so t_i=i−1 and d_i=1, hence r_i=i and ∑_{i=2}^m log(1+r_i)=Θ(m log m). For i=m+j (even block), 1≤j≤m, the most recent earlier value-neighbor is value 2j−1 at index j, so t_i=m. If j=1 then d_i=m−1 (values between 2 and 2m−1 contribute the m−2 odd numbers 3,5,…,2m−3), hence r_i=min{(m−1)+m, m+1}=m+1. If 2≤j≤m then d_i=2 (only 2j−1 lies between 2j−2 and 2j), so r_i=min{m+2, m+j}=m+2. Thus every i in the even block contributes Θ(log m), and the block contributes Θ(m log m). Therefore Reg_log(π)=Θ(m log m + m log m)=Θ(n log n).
Consequently Reg_log(π)/MST_log^{||·||}(π)=Θ(log n) for any fixed norm.
∎

Consequences
- Reg dominates MST: in L∞, MST_log(π) ≤ Reg_log(π) for all π (Theorem 1). For any norm ||·||, MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ [1 + (log b)/log 3] · Reg_log(π) with b=sup_{||z||_∞=1} ||z|| (Theorem 2).
- No constant reverse domination: there is no universal C with Reg_log(π) ≤ C·MST_log^{||·||}(π) for all π; the worst-case gap is Θ(log n) (Theorem 4). Nevertheless, universally Reg_log(π) ≤ [log(1+n)/c] · MST_log^{||·||}(π) with explicit c>0 depending only on the norm (Theorem 3).
These results resolve the asymptotic comparison between MST_log and Reg_log up to an optimal Θ(log n) factor in the worst case.
