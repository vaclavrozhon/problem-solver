Asymptotic comparison between MST_log and Reg_log

Setup. Fix n≥2 and a permutation π∈S_n. Let P_π={p_i=(i,π(i)) : i=1,…,n}⊂R^2. Fix a norm ||·|| on R^2 and a logarithm base; changing either only rescales constants. For u,v∈P_π define the edge weight w(u,v)=log(1+||u−v||). Let MST_log^{||·||}(π) be the total w-weight of a minimum spanning tree on P_π.

For i≥2 define
- Δ_i := |π(i)−π(i−1)|,
- t_i := min{i−j : 1≤j<i and |π(i)−π(j)|=1}, with t_i := i−1 if no such j exists,
- d_i := 1 + #{ k<i : min(π(i−1),π(i)) < π(k) < max(π(i−1),π(i)) },
- r_i := min{ d_i + t_i, i }.
Set Reg_log(π) := ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+r_i). Note that d_i≥1 and t_i≥1 (or =i−1), hence r_i≥2 and Reg_log(π) ≥ (n−1)·log 3.

We resolve the three questions by proving: (i) MST_log ≤ C·Reg_log for a universal C (C=1 for L∞); (ii) a universal reverse bound Reg_log ≤ O(log n)·MST_log; (iii) tightness via a family with Reg_log/MST_log=Θ(log n).

Theorem 1 (Exact one-sided domination in L∞). For the L∞ norm,
  MST_log^∞(π) ≤ Reg_log(π) for all π.

Proof. For t≥0, let G(t) be the graph on P_π with an edge {u,v} iff ||u−v||_∞ ≤ t, and let κ(t) be its number of connected components. For an MST with L∞-edge lengths {ℓ_e}, Kruskal’s algorithm yields the identity
  MST_log^∞(π) = ∑_e log(1+ℓ_e) = ∫_0^∞ (κ(t)−1) d log(1+t).
Indeed, for each t, the number of MST edges with length > t equals κ(t)−1 (edges with length ≤ t connect each component of G(t) into a tree), and ∫_0^{ℓ} d log(1+t) = log(1+ℓ).
Construct a sparse subgraph H(t) as follows. Process i=2,…,n; add to H(t):
- the time edge (i−1,i) if Δ_i ≤ t (then ||p_i−p_{i−1}||_∞ = max{1,Δ_i} ≤ t), and
- the value-neighbor edge (i,j), where j<i is the largest index with |π(i)−π(j)|=1, if t_i ≤ t (then ||p_i−p_j||_∞ = max{1,t_i} ≤ t).
Thus H(t)⊆G(t), so κ(t)≤κ_H(t). Expose vertices in increasing i and let κ_H,i(t) be the component count induced by {1,…,i}. When i arrives, the count increases by 1; if at least one of the two edges is present, i attaches to a previous component, reducing the count by 1; if both are present and connect to two distinct components, it reduces by 2, which only decreases κ further. Therefore
  κ_H,i(t) ≤ κ_H,i−1(t) + 1[Δ_i>t and t_i>t].
By induction, κ_H(t) ≤ 1 + |{ i∈{2,…,n} : Δ_i>t and t_i>t }|. Integrating,
  MST_log^∞(π) ≤ ∫_0^∞ |{i : Δ_i>t, t_i>t}| d log(1+t)
                 = ∑_{i=2}^n ∫_0^{min{Δ_i,t_i}} d log(1+t)
                 = ∑_{i=2}^n log(1 + min{Δ_i,t_i})
                 ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n log(1 + r_i) = Reg_log(π),
using r_i ≥ t_i. ∎

Corollary 2 (Domination for any norm; explicit constant). Let b:=sup_{||z||_∞=1} ||z|| ∈ [1,∞). Then for all π,
  MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ (1 + (log b)/log 3) · Reg_log(π).

Proof. Let T∞ be an L∞-MST. For any edge e, 1+||e|| ≤ b(1+||e||_∞), hence log(1+||e||) ≤ log b + log(1+||e||_∞). Summing over the n−1 edges of T∞ yields
  MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ (n−1)·log b + MST_log^∞(π) ≤ (n−1)·log b + Reg_log(π).
Since Reg_log(π) ≥ (n−1)·log 3, the additive term is absorbed, yielding the stated factor. For L_p in R^2, b=2^{1/p}, giving MST_log^{(p)}(π) ≤ (1 + (log 2)/(p·log 3))·Reg_log(π). ∎

Theorem 3 (Universal logarithmic reverse bound). For any fixed norm ||·|| there exists c>0 such that for all π and n,
  Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/c) · MST_log^{||·||}(π).

Proof. In a permutation grid, any two distinct points differ by at least 1 in each coordinate. Thus every spanning-tree edge has length at least α and weight at least c:=log(1+α), where (α,c) equals (1,log 2) in L∞, (√2, log(1+√2)) in L2, and (2, log 3) in L1. More generally, by norm equivalence there is α>0 with ||z|| ≥ α||z||_∞, giving the same conclusion with c=log(1+α). Hence MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≥ (n−1)·c. Also r_i≤i implies Reg_log(π) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+i) ≤ (n−1)·log(1+n). Combining yields the claim. ∎

Theorem 4 (Separation; no reverse constant). There is no universal C with Reg_log(π) ≤ C·MST_log^{||·||}(π) for all π. In fact, for any fixed norm there exist permutations with Reg_log/MST_log = Θ(log n).

Proof. For even n, take the parity-block permutation: list all even values in increasing order, then all odd values in increasing order; i.e., π(i)=2i for 1≤i≤n/2 and π(i)=2(i−n/2)−1 for i>n/2.
MST_log^{||·||}(π)=Θ(n): within each half, the time edges (i−1,i) have Δ_i=2, hence constant weight; these n−2 edges contribute Θ(n). One bridge connects the halves, costing O(log n). A matching Ω(n) lower bound holds since every MST has n−1 edges of weight ≥c>0 (Theorem 3). Thus MST_log=Θ(n).
Reg_log(π)=Θ(n log n): in the first half (even block), no odd has appeared, so for 2≤i≤n/2 one has t_i=i−1 and d_i=1; hence r_i=i and ∑_{i=2}^{n/2} log(1+r_i)=Θ((n/2)·log n). In the second half (odd block), the nearest value-neighbor lies in the first half at temporal distance t_i=n/2 for all but the first odd, and d_i=2 (the unique even between consecutive odds has appeared), hence r_i=Θ(n) for almost all i, contributing Θ(log n) each; the first odd has r_i=Θ(n) as well. Thus the odd block contributes Θ((n/2)·log n). Summing gives Reg_log(π)=Θ(n log n). Therefore Reg_log/MST_log=Θ(log n). ∎

Consequences. Theorems 1–4 resolve the dominance questions:
- Reg dominates MST: MST_log^∞(π) ≤ Reg_log(π) for all π; for any fixed norm, MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ (1 + (log b)/log 3)·Reg_log(π).
- MST does not dominate Reg by a constant: there are permutations with Reg_log/MST_log = Θ(log n).
- Universal upper bound: for all π, Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/c)·MST_log^{||·||}(π).
Hence the worst-case multiplicative gap is Θ(log n) and this is optimal. Constants depend only on the norm and the logarithm base.
