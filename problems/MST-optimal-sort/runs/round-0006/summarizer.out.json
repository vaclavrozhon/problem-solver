  "summary_md": "Using Kruskal\u2019s integral identity and a sparse threshold graph H(t) we proved MST_log(\u03c0) \u2264 Reg_log(\u03c0) for the L\u221e norm; norm equivalence lifts this to MST_log^N(\u03c0) \u2264 C_N\u00b7Reg_log(\u03c0) for any fixed norm. Residue-class (mod-m) permutations (parity as m=2) give MST_log=\u0398(n) but Reg_log=\u0398(n log n), so Reg_log/MST_log=\u0398(log n) and no universal constant reverses the inequality. A per-edge lower bound on MST yields Reg_log(\u03c0) \u2264 (log(1+n)/c_N)\u00b7MST_log^N(\u03c0) with explicit c_N for common norms, so the worst-case multiplicative gap is \u0398(log n) and is tight.
