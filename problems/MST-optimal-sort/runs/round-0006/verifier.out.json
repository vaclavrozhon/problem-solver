  "feedback_md": "The main questions are now resolved with rigorous, self-contained proofs promoted to output.md. The core L\u221e bound MST_log \u2264 Reg_log is correctly derived using the Kruskal integral identity specialized to log(1+distance) and a sparse subgraph H(t) containing only (i) time edges when \u0394_i\u2264t and (ii) most-recent value-neighbor edges when t_i\u2264t. The component-count inequality \u03ba_G(t) \u2264 1 + |{i\u22652: \u0394_i>t and t_i>t}| is justified by exposing vertices in increasing i and observing that a new component persists only if both local edges are absent; this avoids earlier pitfalls (e.g., t at the later endpoint equaling the gap s_v, which is false in general). Integrating yields MST_log(L\u221e) \u2264 \u2211 log(1+min{\u0394_i,t_i}) \u2264 \u2211 log(1+r_i)=Reg_log.\n\nThe norm-lifting is sharpened: for any norm with b=sup ||z||/||z||\u221e, the inequality 1+||e|| \u2264 b(1+||e||\u221e) gives log(1+||e||) \u2264 log b + log(1+||e||\u221e), hence MST_log^N \u2264 (n\u22121)log b + MST_log(L\u221e) \u2264 (1+(log b)/log 3)\u00b7Reg_log using Reg_log \u2265 (n\u22121)log 3. Explicit constants for L_p (C_p=1+(log 2)/(p\u00b7log 3)) are correctly recorded.\n\nThe reverse direction is resolved tightly. The parity (and mod\u2013m) families have MST_log = \u0398(n) (by a concrete spanning tree with O(log n) bridging overhead) while Reg_log = \u0398(n log(n/m)), giving Reg/MST = \u0398(log n) for constant m. The universal reverse bound Reg_log \u2264 (log(1+n)/c_N)\u00b7MST_log^N via minimal per-edge weight in permutation grids is correct (L\u221e: log 2; L2: log(1+\u221a2); L1: log 3), proving the \u0398(log n) gap is optimal in order.\n\nMinor points: (i) Ensure tie-thresholds in the Kruskal integral are noted as measure-zero (they are, in output). (ii) All uses of d_i \u2264 \u0394_i and r_i \u2265 t_i are explicit where needed. (iii) The bridging bound in mod\u2013m is handled carefully (O(m log n) total). \n\nNext steps (optional): quantify leading constants in E[MST_log] and E[Reg_log] for random \u03c0; explore instance-sensitive refinements beyond \u0398(log n) worst-case; and record the concave-weight extension MST_\u03c6^\u221e \u2264 \u2211 \u03c6(min{\u0394_i,t_i}) in proofs.md (already reflected conceptually).",
  "summary_md": "We proved MST_log \u2264 Reg_log in L\u221e via the Kruskal integral and a sparse H(t), and lifted to any norm with factor 1+(log b)/log 3 (explicit for L_p). No reverse constant holds: parity/mod\u2013m permutations give Reg/MST = \u0398(log n). A universal reverse bound Reg \u2264 (log(1+n)/c_N)\u00b7MST holds with explicit c_N. The \u0398(log n) worst-case gap is tight. Output.md now contains a rigorous, self-contained proof.",
