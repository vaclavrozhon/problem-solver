It features Theorem 1, Corollary 2, and other theorems, which seems solid. The user did ask for the proof in output.md, but I believe we already provided it. Since the \"Current Output\" content aligns with those requirements, I can just leave output_update as null. However, taking extra caution to replace or clean it up is an option worth considering.",

The guidelines suggest that proofs.md should feature detailed proofs, but they're currently in output.md. The \"Three-tier\" indicates that output.md contains self-contained proofs that are required, so leaving proofs_update as null makes sense. While I could consider appending them to proofs.md, the user specifically requested the proof in output.md. \n\nNow, I need to create feedback_md of at least 200 words to critique the provers' outputs. The provers have given multiple aligned versions, so I\u2019ll mention minor issues. For Prover 1, there was an earlier additive O(n) method compared to a later exact approach. I\u2019ll also focus on ensuring L\u221e uses exact equality integration and correcting log b vs. log(1+b) improvements, as well as separation proofs and careful counts.\n\nFor next steps, I'll provide expected constants and concave weight generalization. Additionally, I\u2019ll include a concise summary in summary_md indicating that the results are promising and noting that there are no blocking issues.",

The instruction to \u201cwrite the proof to output.md\u201d implies I should double-check, but everything is in place.\n\nNext, I'll craft feedback_md, aiming for 250-300 words. I\u2019ll mention the correctness of the Kruskal integral identity and the construction of H(t), along with the log b constant improvement and minimal per-edge weight c_N. I should also touch on potential future directions, like random permutation expected constants and extending to general concave weights.\n\nAdditionally, I could suggest verifying measure-zero ties and the monotonic kappa property, plus mention the P2 param mod-m bridging edges counts.",

          "text": "{\"feedback_md\":\"The main questions are now resolved with rigorous, self-contained proofs promoted to output.md. The core L\u221e bound MST_log \u2264 Reg_log is correctly derived using the Kruskal integral identity specialized to log(1+distance) and a sparse subgraph H(t) containing only (i) time edges when \u0394_i\u2264t and (ii) most-recent value-neighbor edges when t_i\u2264t. The component-count inequality \u03ba_G(t) \u2264 1 + |{i\u22652: \u0394_i>t and t_i>t}| is justified by exposing vertices in increasing i and observing that a new component persists only if both local edges are absent; this avoids earlier pitfalls (e.g., t at the later endpoint equaling the gap s_v, which is false in general). Integrating yields MST_log(L\u221e) \u2264 \u2211 log(1+min{\u0394_i,t_i}) \u2264 \u2211 log(1+r_i)=Reg_log.\\n\\nThe norm-lifting is sharpened: for any norm with b=sup ||z||/||z||\u221e, the inequality 1+||e|| \u2264 b(1+||e||\u221e) gives log(1+||e||) \u2264 log b + log(1+||e||\u221e), hence MST_log^N \u2264 (n\u22121)log b + MST_log(L\u221e) \u2264 (1+(log b)/log 3)\u00b7Reg_log using Reg_log \u2265 (n\u22121)log 3. Explicit constants for L_p (C_p=1+(log 2)/(p\u00b7log 3)) are correctly recorded.\\n\\nThe reverse direction is resolved tightly. The parity (and mod\u2013m) families have MST_log = \u0398(n) (by a concrete spanning tree with O(log n) bridging overhead) while Reg_log = \u0398(n log(n/m)), giving Reg/MST = \u0398(log n) for constant m. The universal reverse bound Reg_log \u2264 (log(1+n)/c_N)\u00b7MST_log^N via minimal per-edge weight in permutation grids is correct (L\u221e: log 2; L2: log(1+\u221a2); L1: log 3), proving the \u0398(log n) gap is optimal in order.\\n\\nMinor points: (i) Ensure tie-thresholds in the Kruskal integral are noted as measure-zero (they are, in output). (ii) All uses of d_i \u2264 \u0394_i and r_i \u2265 t_i are explicit where needed. (iii) The bridging bound in mod\u2013m is handled carefully (O(m log n) total). \\n\\nNext steps (optional): quantify leading constants in E[MST_log] and E[Reg_log] for random \u03c0; explore instance-sensitive refinements beyond \u0398(log n) worst-case; and record the concave-weight extension MST_\u03c6^\u221e \u2264 \u2211 \u03c6(min{\u0394_i,t_i}) in proofs.md (already reflected conceptually).\",\"summary_md\":\"We proved MST_log \u2264 Reg_log in L\u221e via the Kruskal integral and a sparse H(t), and lifted to any norm with factor 1+(log b)/log 3 (explicit for L_p). No reverse constant holds: parity/mod\u2013m permutations give Reg/MST = \u0398(log n). A universal reverse bound Reg \u2264 (log(1+n)/c_N)\u00b7MST holds with explicit c_N.
