We proved MST_log ≤ Reg_log in L∞ via the Kruskal integral and a sparse H(t), and lifted to any norm with factor 1+(log b)/log 3 (explicit for L_p). No reverse constant holds: parity/mod–m permutations give Reg/MST = Θ(log n). A universal reverse bound Reg ≤ (log(1+n)/c_N)·MST holds with explicit c_N. The Θ(log n) worst-case gap is tight. Output.md now contains a rigorous, self-contained proof.
