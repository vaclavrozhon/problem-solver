{"feedback_md":"The main questions are now resolved with rigorous, self-contained proofs promoted to output.md. The core L∞ bound MST_log ≤ Reg_log is correctly derived using the Kruskal integral identity specialized to log(1+distance) and a sparse subgraph H(t) containing only (i) time edges when Δ_i≤t and (ii) most-recent value-neighbor edges when t_i≤t. The component-count inequality κ_G(t) ≤ 1 + |{i≥2: Δ_i>t and t_i>t}| is justified by exposing vertices in increasing i and observing that a new component persists only if both local edges are absent; this avoids earlier pitfalls (e.g., t at the later endpoint equaling the gap s_v, which is false in general). Integrating yields MST_log(L∞) ≤ ∑ log(1+min{Δ_i,t_i}) ≤ ∑ log(1+r_i)=Reg_log.\n\nThe norm-lifting is sharpened: for any norm with b=sup ||z||/||z||∞, the inequality 1+||e|| ≤ b(1+||e||∞) gives log(1+||e||) ≤ log b + log(1+||e||∞), hence MST_log^N ≤ (n−1)log b + MST_log(L∞) ≤ (1+(log b)/log 3)·Reg_log using Reg_log ≥ (n−1)log 3. Explicit constants for L_p (C_p=1+(log 2)/(p·log 3)) are correctly recorded.\n\nThe reverse direction is resolved tightly. The parity (and mod–m) families have MST_log = Θ(n) (by a concrete spanning tree with O(log n) bridging overhead) while Reg_log = Θ(n log(n/m)), giving Reg/MST = Θ(log n) for constant m. The universal reverse bound Reg_log ≤ (log(1+n)/c_N)·MST_log^N via minimal per-edge weight in permutation grids is correct (L∞: log 2; L2: log(1+√2); L1: log 3), proving the Θ(log n) gap is optimal in order.\n\nMinor points: (i) Ensure tie-thresholds in the Kruskal integral are noted as measure-zero (they are, in output). (ii) All uses of d_i ≤ Δ_i and r_i ≥ t_i are explicit where needed. (iii) The bridging bound in mod–m is handled carefully (O(m log n) total). \n\nNext steps (optional): quantify leading constants in E[MST_log] and E[Reg_log] for random π; explore instance-sensitive refinements beyond Θ(log n) worst-case; and record the concave-weight extension MST_φ^∞ ≤ ∑ φ(min{Δ_i,t_i}) in proofs.md (already reflected conceptually).","summary_md":"We proved MST_log ≤ Reg_log in L∞ via the Kruskal integral and a sparse H(t), and lifted to any norm with factor 1+(log b)/log 3 (explicit for L_p). No reverse constant holds: parity/mod–m permutations give Reg/MST = Θ(log n). A universal reverse bound Reg ≤ (log(1+n)/c_N)·MST holds with explicit c_N. The Θ(log n) worst-case gap is tight.
