Asymptotic comparison between MST_log and Reg_log

Setup and definitions
- Fix an integer n≥2 and a permutation π∈S_n. Represent π by the point set P_π={p_i=(i,π(i)) : i=1,…,n}⊂R^2.
- Fix a norm ||·|| on R^2 and a logarithm base (changing either rescales all quantities by fixed positive constants). For u,v∈P_π set w(u,v)=log(1+||u−v||).
- Let MST_log^{||·||}(π) be the total w-weight of a minimum spanning tree (MST) on P_π. For ||·||=||·||_∞ (L∞) write MST_log(π).
- For i≥2 define
  Δ_i:=|π(i)−π(i−1)|,
  t_i:=min{i−j : 1≤j<i, |π(i)−π(j)|=1} (and t_i:=i−1 if the set is empty),
  d_i:=1+# { k<i : min(π(i−1),π(i)) < π(k) < max(π(i−1),π(i)) },
  r_i:=min{ d_i+t_i, i }.
Set Reg_log(π):=∑_{i=2}^n log(1+r_i). Note: for i≥2 we have d_i≥1 and t_i≥1, hence r_i≥2 and log(1+r_i)≥log 3.

Theorem 1 (Exact one-sided domination in L∞)
For every permutation π, MST_log(π) ≤ Reg_log(π).

Proof.
For t≥0, let G(t) be the graph on P_π with an edge {u,v} whenever ||u−v||_∞ ≤ t, and let κ(t) be the number of connected components of G(t). If the L∞-lengths of the MST edges are {ℓ_e}, then the standard Kruskal integral identity gives
MST_log(π) = ∑_e log(1+ℓ_e) = ∫_0^∞ #(e: ℓ_e>t) dt/(1+t) = ∫_0^∞ (κ(t)−1) dt/(1+t),
where the last equality holds for all t except a measure-zero set of thresholds (ties).
We upper bound κ(t) via a sparse subgraph H(t). For each i=2,…,n define at most one “parent” index par_t(i) as follows:
- If Δ_i ≤ t, set par_t(i)=i−1.
- Else if there exists j<i with |π(i)−π(j)|=1 and i−j ≤ t (equivalently t_i ≤ t), set par_t(i)=j (choose the largest such j).
- Else leave par_t(i) undefined.
Whenever par_t(i) is defined, the L∞-length of the edge (p_i,p_{par_t(i)}) is max{1,Δ_i} or max{1,t_i}, hence ≤ t. Let F(t) be the directed forest on {1,…,n} consisting of the edges (i,par_t(i)) (oriented from i to par_t(i)); let H(t) be its underlying undirected graph. Then H(t)⊆G(t), so κ(t) ≤ κ_H(t). Moreover, each i≥2 contributes exactly one component if par_t(i) is undefined and contributes none otherwise, while vertex 1 contributes one component; thus
κ_H(t) = 1 + |{ i∈{2,…,n} : par_t(i) is undefined }|
= 1 + |{ i∈{2,…,n} : Δ_i>t and t_i>t }|.
Therefore κ(t) ≤ 1 + |{ i≥2 : Δ_i>t and t_i>t }|. Integrating,
MST_log(π) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n ∫_0^∞ 1[Δ_i>t and t_i>t] dt/(1+t) = ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+min{Δ_i,t_i}).
Finally, r_i≥t_i implies log(1+min{Δ_i,t_i}) ≤ log(1+t_i) ≤ log(1+r_i). Summing over i proves MST_log(π) ≤ Reg_log(π).
∎

Theorem 2 (Domination in any fixed norm)
Let ||·|| be any norm on R^2, and let b:=sup_{||z||_∞=1} ||z|| ∈ [1,∞). Then for all π,
MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ [1 + (log b)/log 3] · Reg_log(π).

Proof.
Let T_∞ be an L∞-MST. For any edge e, ||e|| ≤ b||e||_∞, hence 1+||e|| ≤ b(1+||e||_∞) and log(1+||e||) ≤ log b + log(1+||e||_∞). Summing over the n−1 edges of T_∞,
MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ (n−1)·log b + MST_log(π) ≤ (n−1)·log b + Reg_log(π).
Since Reg_log(π) ≥ (n−1)·log 3, the additive term is absorbed, yielding MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ [1 + (log b)/log 3] · Reg_log(π). For L_p in R^2, b=2^{1/p}.
∎

Theorem 3 (Universal logarithmic reverse bound)
For any fixed norm ||·|| there exists c>0, depending only on ||·|| and the log base, such that for all π and n,
Reg_log(π) ≤ [log(1+n)/c] · MST_log^{||·||}(π).
In particular, one may take c=log 2 for L∞, c=log(1+√2) for L2, and c=log 3 for L1.

Proof.
In a permutation grid, for any distinct i≠j we have |i−j|≥1 and |π(i)−π(j)|≥1; thus every L∞-edge length is ≥1, every L2-edge length ≥√2, and every L1-edge length ≥2. Therefore each MST edge has weight at least c:=log(1+α), with α=1,√2,2 in L∞, L2, L1 respectively. Hence MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≥ (n−1)·c. On the other hand r_i≤i implies Reg_log(π) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+i) ≤ (n−1)·log(1+n). Combining, Reg_log(π) ≤ [log(1+n)/c] · MST_log^{||·||}(π).
∎

Theorem 4 (Separation; tightness of the Θ(log n) gap)
There exists a family of permutations {π_n} such that for every fixed norm ||·||,
Reg_log(π_n) / MST_log^{||·||}(π_n) = Θ(log n).
In particular, there is no universal constant C with Reg_log(π) ≤ C·MST_log^{||·||}(π) for all π.

Proof.
Let n=2m and define π by listing all odd values then all even values:
π(i)=2i−1 for 1≤i≤m, and π(m+j)=2j for 1≤j≤m.
MST cost. In L∞, connect consecutive indices within each block and add one bridge between the blocks. Within a block, ||p_{i+1}−p_i||_∞=max{1,2}=2, so each such edge has weight log 3; the bridge between p_m and p_{m+1} has L∞-length 2m−3 and weight log(2m−2)=Θ(log n). Thus MST_log(π) ≤ (n−2)·log 3 + Θ(log n) = Θ(n). A matching Ω(n) lower bound holds since every MST has n−1 edges and each has weight ≥log 2; hence MST_log(π)=Θ(n). The same spanning-tree pattern shows MST_log^{||·||}(π)=Θ(n) for L1 and L2 (constant intra-block edge lengths and one bridge of length Θ(n)).
Reg cost. For 2≤i≤m (odd block), no earlier value-neighbor exists: t_i=i−1 and d_i=1, hence r_i=i and ∑_{i=2}^m log(1+r_i)=Θ(m log m). For i=m+j (even block), 1≤j≤m, the most recent earlier neighbor is value 2j+1 at index j+1 if j<m and value 2j−1 at index j if j=m; hence t_i=m−1 for j<m and t_i=m for j=m. Further, d_i= m−1 for j=1 and d_i=2 for 2≤j≤m. Therefore r_i=m+1 for all j<m and r_{2m}=m+2, so each even-block index contributes Θ(log m). Summing, the even block contributes Θ(m log m). Hence Reg_log(π)=Θ(m log m + m log m)=Θ(n log n).
Consequently Reg_log(π)/MST_log^{||·||}(π)=Θ(log n) for any fixed norm.
∎

Consequences
- Reg dominates MST: in L∞, MST_log(π) ≤ Reg_log(π) for all π (Theorem 1); for any norm ||·||, MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ [1 + (log b)/log 3]·Reg_log(π), with b=sup_{||z||_∞=1} ||z|| (Theorem 2).
- No constant reverse domination: there is no universal C with Reg_log(π) ≤ C·MST_log^{||·||}(π) for all π; the worst-case gap is Θ(log n) (Theorem 4). Nevertheless, universally Reg_log(π) ≤ [log(1+n)/c]·MST_log^{||·||}(π) with explicit c>0 depending only on the norm (Theorem 3).
Thus the asymptotic comparison between MST_log and Reg_log is resolved up to an optimal Θ(log n) factor in the worst case. All constants depend only on the norm and the chosen logarithm base.
