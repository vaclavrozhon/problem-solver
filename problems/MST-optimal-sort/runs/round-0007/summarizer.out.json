  "summary_md": "We proved MST_log(L\u221e)(\u03c0) \u2264 Reg_log(\u03c0) by applying Kruskal\u2019s integral identity and bounding component counts via a sparse threshold graph H(t). Using norm equivalence this lifts to MST_log^N(\u03c0) \u2264 C_N\u00b7Reg_log(\u03c0) for any fixed norm N (explicit C_N from operator-norm bounds). Residue-class (mod-m, e.g. parity) permutations give MST_log=\u0398(n) but Reg_log=\u0398(n log n), so Reg_log/MST_log=\u0398(log n) and no universal constant reverses the inequality. A per-edge lower bound on MST yields Reg_log(\u03c0) \u2264 (log(1+n)/c_N)\u00b7MST_log^N(\u03c0) with explicit c_N for common norms, hence the worst-case multiplicative gap is \u0398(log n) and is tight. Extensions include refined constants for L_p, a concave-weight generalization, and a temporal\u2192value pairing lemma. Sources: Research Notes; Current Proofs.",
