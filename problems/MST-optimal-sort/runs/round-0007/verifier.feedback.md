The problem is now resolved with rigorous, self-contained results in output.md. The core tool is Kruskal’s integral identity specialized to the weight log(1+distance), combined with a sparse threshold subgraph H(t) that uses only two local edges per step i: a time edge (i−1,i) when Δ_i≤t and a most-recent value-neighbor edge when t_i≤t. Processing vertices in increasing i, the component count can increase only when both edges are absent (Δ_i>t and t_i>t). Integrating over t yields MST_log(L∞) ≤ ∑ log(1+min{Δ_i,t_i}) ≤ ∑ log(1+r_i)=Reg_log, since r_i≥t_i. The handling of tie thresholds is explicitly measure-zero. This repairs earlier flawed arguments (e.g., erroneously equating a min-gap with s_v) and avoids double-counting.

Norm lifting is sharpened correctly via 1+||e|| ≤ b(1+||e||∞), giving MST_log^N ≤ (n−1)log b + MST_log(L∞), and Reg_log ≥ (n−1)log 3 absorbs the additive term, yielding the factor 1+(log b)/log 3 (with C_p = 1+(log 2)/(p·log 3) for L_p). The universal reverse bound Reg_log ≤ (log(1+n)/c_N)·MST_log^N uses the uniform lower bound on any tree edge in permutation grids (L∞: log 2; L2: log(1+√2); L1: log 3), and is clean.

The separation via parity/mod-m permutations is carefully quantified: MST_log = Θ(n) (constant-cost intra-block edges plus O(log n) bridging), while Reg_log = Θ(n log(n/m)), giving Θ(log n) worst-case ratio for constant m. This proves no constant reverse domination and matches the universal upper bound up to constants. The output is consistent, self-contained, and norm/base invariant up to constants.

Next: optionally add the concave-weight extension MST_φ^∞ ≤ ∑ φ(min{Δ_i,t_i}) to proofs.md; quantify E[MST_log], E[Reg_log] for random π; explore instance-sensitive refinements beyond the Θ(log n) worst-case.
