  "feedback_md": "The problem is now resolved with rigorous, self-contained results in output.md. The core tool is Kruskal\u2019s integral identity specialized to the weight log(1+distance), combined with a sparse threshold subgraph H(t) that uses only two local edges per step i: a time edge (i\u22121,i) when \u0394_i\u2264t and a most-recent value-neighbor edge when t_i\u2264t. Processing vertices in increasing i, the component count can increase only when both edges are absent (\u0394_i>t and t_i>t). Integrating over t yields MST_log(L\u221e) \u2264 \u2211 log(1+min{\u0394_i,t_i}) \u2264 \u2211 log(1+r_i)=Reg_log, since r_i\u2265t_i. The handling of tie thresholds is explicitly measure-zero. This repairs earlier flawed arguments (e.g., erroneously equating a min-gap with s_v) and avoids double-counting.\n\nNorm lifting is sharpened correctly via 1+||e|| \u2264 b(1+||e||\u221e), giving MST_log^N \u2264 (n\u22121)log b + MST_log(L\u221e), and Reg_log \u2265 (n\u22121)log 3 absorbs the additive term, yielding the factor 1+(log b)/log 3 (with C_p = 1+(log 2)/(p\u00b7log 3) for L_p). The universal reverse bound Reg_log \u2264 (log(1+n)/c_N)\u00b7MST_log^N uses the uniform lower bound on any tree edge in permutation grids (L\u221e: log 2; L2: log(1+\u221a2); L1: log 3), and is clean.\n\nThe separation via parity/mod-m permutations is carefully quantified: MST_log = \u0398(n) (constant-cost intra-block edges plus O(log n) bridging), while Reg_log = \u0398(n log(n/m)), giving \u0398(log n) worst-case ratio for constant m. This proves no constant reverse domination and matches the universal upper bound up to constants. The output is consistent, self-contained, and norm/base invariant up to constants.\n\nNext: optionally add the concave-weight extension MST_\u03c6^\u221e \u2264 \u2211 \u03c6(min{\u0394_i,t_i}) to proofs.md; quantify E[MST_log], E[Reg_log] for random \u03c0; explore instance-sensitive refinements beyond the \u0398(log n) worst-case.\n",
  "summary_md": "Output now contains a complete proof: (1) MST_log \u2264 Reg_log in L\u221e via Kruskal\u2019s integral and a sparse H(t); (2) for any norm, MST_log^N \u2264 (1+(log b)/log 3)\u00b7Reg_log; (3) Reg_log \u2264 (log(1+n)/c_N)\u00b7MST_log^N; (4) parity/mod-m families give Reg/MST = \u0398(log n), proving tightness.",
