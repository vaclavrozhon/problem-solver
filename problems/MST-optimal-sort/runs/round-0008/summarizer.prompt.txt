# Problem: Asymptotic Dominance Between an MST–Log Distance Measure and **Reg**

Let \(n \in \mathbb{N}\) and let \(\pi \in S_n\) be a permutation. Represent the input as
\[
P_\pi = \{\,p_i = (i,\pi(i)) : i=1,\dots,n\,\}\subset \{1,\dots,n\}^2 .
\]

Fix any norm \(\|\cdot\|\) on \(\mathbb{R}^2\) (e.g., \(L_1, L_2,\) or \(L_\infty\)). All choices are equivalent up to constant factors, so asymptotic comparisons are norm-invariant.

---

## Measure 1: \(\mathrm{MST}_{\log}(\pi)\)

Define edge weights between points \(p_i,p_j\) by  
\[
w(p_i,p_j)=\log\!\bigl(1+\|p_i-p_j\|\bigr),
\]  
where the logarithm base is fixed but arbitrary.

Let \(T\) be a minimum spanning tree of the complete graph on \(P_\pi\) with weights \(w\). Set  
\[
\boxed{\mathrm{MST}_{\log}(\pi)=\sum_{e\in E(T)} w(e).}
\]

---

## Measure 2: \(\mathrm{Reg}_{\log}(\pi)\)

For \(i \ge 2\), let

* **Value-distance from the previous key**  
  \[
  d_i = 1 + \#\{\,k < i : \min(\pi(i-1),\pi(i)) < \pi(k) < \max(\pi(i-1),\pi(i))\,\}.
  \]

* **Temporal distance to the most recent true neighbor in value order**  
  \[
  t_i = \min\{\, i-j : 1 \le j < i,\; |\pi(i)-\pi(j)| = 1 \,\},
  \]  
  with \(t_i = i-1\) if no such \(j\) exists.

* **Regional radius**  
  \[
  r_i = \min\{\, d_i + t_i,\; i \,\}.
  \]

Define the logged regional cost  
\[
\boxed{\mathrm{Reg}_{\log}(\pi) = \sum_{i=2}^n \log(1 + r_i).}
\]

Using \(\log(1+r_i)\) (rather than \(r_i-1\)) ensures that a **random permutation** has  
\[
\mathrm{Reg}_{\log}(\pi) = \Theta(n \log n),
\]  
matching the \(\Theta(n \log n)\) comparisons needed for typical sorting.  
Without the logarithm, \(\sum (r_i-1)\) for a random permutation is \(\Theta(n^2)\), which is too large compared to standard sorting bounds.

**Notes.**

* The choice of norm and log base only rescales values by constants.  
* Using \(\log(1+r_i)\) aligns \(\mathrm{Reg}_{\log}\) with classical adaptive-sorting analyses where a random permutation costs \(\Theta(n\log n)\).  
* One may also consider variants such as asking whether  
  \[
  C^{-1}\mathrm{Reg}_{\log}(\pi)\le \mathrm{MST}_{\log}(\pi)\le C\,\mathrm{Reg}_{\log}(\pi)
  \]  
  holds for some universal \(C\).

Summary of current understanding

- Definitions: P_π = {(i, π(i))}, MST_log uses weights w(u,v)=log(1+||u−v||). Reg_log(π)=∑_{i=2}^n log(1+r_i) with r_i=min(d_i+t_i, i), d_i counts prior values between π(i−1) and π(i), and t_i is the temporal distance to the most recent earlier value-neighbor (|Δ value|=1), defaulting to i−1 if none exists.

- One-sided domination (L∞): Using Kruskal’s integral identity, ∑_{e∈MST} log(1+ℓ_e) = ∫_0^∞ (κ(t)−1) dt/(1+t), where κ(t) is the number of components in the threshold graph with edges of L∞-length ≤ t. Build a sparse subgraph H(t): when processing p_i, add the time edge (i−1,i) if |π(i)−π(i−1)|≤t, and the value-neighbor edge to the most recent earlier neighbor if t_i≤t. Then κ_G(t) ≤ κ_H(t) ≤ 1 + |{i≥2: Δ_i>t and t_i>t}|. Integrating yields MST_log(L∞) ≤ ∑ log(1+min(Δ_i,t_i)) ≤ ∑ log(1+r_i) = Reg_log.

- Norm invariance: For any norm ||·|| with ||z|| ≤ b||z||∞, choose an L∞-MST T∞ and obtain MST_log(||·||) ≤ (n−1)log(1+b) + MST_log(L∞) ≤ (1 + log(1+b)/log 3)·Reg_log, since Reg_log ≥ (n−1)log 3.

- Separation (no reverse domination): Order values by residue classes mod m, listing each class block in increasing order. For fixed m, we can span each block by index-adjacent edges (each costs log(1+m) under L∞), and connect the blocks with O(m) bridges (each costs O(log n)). Hence MST_log = Θ(n). Meanwhile, for any r≥2 and any element v=r+k m of class r, the earlier neighbor v−1 lies in class r−1 exactly m_{r−1} positions earlier, so t_i = m_{r−1} = Θ(n/m); therefore Reg_log ≥ ∑_{r=2}^m m_r log(1+m_{r−1}) = Θ(n log(n/m)). For m constant (e.g., parity), Reg_log/MST_log = Θ(log n).

- Remarks: A previously attempted charge (linking the value-adjacency path edge length directly to t_i at the later endpoint) is invalid in general (the closest earlier neighbor might be v±2). The component-integral method avoids this pitfall.

Open directions

- Likely tight frontier: prove a universal upper bound Reg_log(π) ≤ O(log n)·MST_log(π) for all π, matching the Θ(log n) lower bound from mod-m families.
- Tighten constants in the domination for specific norms; compute best b for L1 and L2.
- Quantify leading constants for E[MST_log], E[Reg_log] under random π.


Addition: universal logarithmic upper bound

- Minimal MST edge weight: For any fixed norm N on R^2, there exists α_N>0 such that ||z||_N ≥ α_N||z||_∞ for all z. Since any two distinct points p_i=(i,π(i)), p_j differ by at least 1 in each coordinate, ||p_i−p_j||_∞ ≥ 1, hence ||p_i−p_j||_N ≥ α_N. Therefore every tree edge has weight ≥ log(1+α_N), so MST_log^N(π) ≥ (n−1)·log(1+α_N).
- Trivial Reg upper bound: r_i ≤ i implies Reg_log(π) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+i) ≤ (n−1)·log(1+n).
- Combining: Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/log(1+α_N)) · MST_log^N(π) for all π. In particular: L∞ gives factor log(1+n)/log 2; for L2, one may sharpen c_N using ||(1,1)||_2=√2 (so each edge has weight ≥ log(1+√2)); for L1 similarly ||(1,1)||_1=2.

Thus, universally Reg_log ≤ Θ(log n)·MST_log, matching the Θ(log n) lower bound from parity/mod-m constructions. This complements the established MST_log ≤ Reg_log (exact in L∞, constant-factor for any fixed norm).

Refined constants for norm lifting and universal upper bound

- Norm lifting (refinement): For any norm ||·|| with b := sup_{z≠0} ||z||/||z||_∞ ≥ 1, we have 1+||e|| ≤ b(1+||e||_∞) for any edge e, hence log(1+||e||) ≤ log b + log(1+||e||_∞). Summing over an L∞-MST gives MST_log^{||·||} ≤ (n−1)·log b + MST_log^{∞}.
  Combining with MST_log^{∞} ≤ Reg_log and Reg_log ≥ (n−1)·log 3 yields MST_log^{||·||} ≤ (1 + (log b)/log 3)·Reg_log.
  For L_p in R^2, b_p = 2^{1/p}, so C_p = 1 + (log 2)/(p·log 3).

- Universal upper bound Reg ≤ Θ(log n)·MST (constants): For permutation grids, any two distinct points have both coordinate gaps ≥1, so every MST edge under
  • L∞ has weight ≥ log 2;
  • L2 has weight ≥ log(1+√2);
  • L1 has weight ≥ log 3.
  Since r_i ≤ i, Reg_log(π) ≤ (n−1)·log(1+n). Therefore Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/c_N)·MST_log^N(π), where c_N is the per-edge lower-bound constant above. This gives a tight Θ(log n) worst-case factor, matching mod-m separations.

- Optional generalization: For any concave, nondecreasing φ with φ(0)=0, the L∞ integral method gives MST_φ(π) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n φ(min{Δ_i, t_i}).

Further refinements and generalizations

- Refined norm-lift constant: For any norm ||·|| with b := sup_{z≠0} ||z||/||z||_∞ ≥ 1, 1+||e|| ≤ b(1+||e||_∞) implies log(1+||e||) ≤ log b + log(1+||e||_∞). Thus MST_log^{||·||} ≤ (n−1)·log b + MST_log^{∞} ≤ (1 + (log b)/log 3)·Reg_log. For L_p in R^2: b_p = 2^{1/p}, so C_p = 1 + (log 2)/(p·log 3).

- Universal upper bound with explicit constants: Every MST edge has weight at least c_N := log(1+α_N), where α_N>0 satisfies ||z|| ≥ α_N||z||_∞. Hence MST_log^N ≥ (n−1)·c_N. Since r_i ≤ i, Reg_log ≤ (n−1)·log(1+n), giving Reg_log ≤ (log(1+n)/c_N)·MST_log^N. In particular: L∞: c_∞=log 2; L2: c_2=log(1+√2); L1: c_1=log 3.

- Concave-weight extension in L∞: For any concave, nondecreasing φ with φ(0)=0, Kruskal’s integral with the sparse H(t) yields MST_φ^{∞}(π) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n φ(min{Δ_i,t_i}) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n φ(r_i).

- Temporal-to-value pairing: Let pos[v] be index of value v and s_v=|pos[v+1]−pos[v]|. For I_val={i≥2: ∃ j<i with |π(i)−π(j)|=1}, the map sending i to v=min{π(i),π(j)} (j realizes t_i) is injective and t_i=s_v. Hence ∑_{i∈I_val} log(1+t_i) ≤ ∑_{v=1}^{n−1} log(1+s_v).

These complement the established results MST_log^{∞} ≤ Reg_log and the Θ(log n) tight separation via mod-m families.

Asymptotic comparison between MST_log and Reg_log

Setup. Fix an integer n≥2 and a permutation π∈S_n. Let P_π={p_i=(i,π(i)) : i=1,…,n}⊂R^2. Fix a norm ||·|| on R^2 and a logarithm base (changing either only rescales constants). For u,v∈P_π define the edge weight w(u,v)=log(1+||u−v||). Let MST_log^{||·||}(π) be the total w-weight of a minimum spanning tree on P_π.

For i≥2 define
- Δ_i := |π(i)−π(i−1)|,
- t_i := min{i−j : 1≤j<i and |π(i)−π(j)|=1}, with t_i := i−1 if no such j exists,
- d_i := 1 + #{ k<i : min(π(i−1),π(i)) < π(k) < max(π(i−1),π(i)) },
- r_i := min{ d_i + t_i, i }.
Set Reg_log(π) := ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+r_i). Note that for all i≥2, d_i≥1 and t_i≥1, hence r_i≥2 and log(1+r_i)≥log 3.

We write MST_log(π) for the L∞ case (||·||=||·||_∞). The main results resolve the dominance questions up to optimal Θ(log n) factors.

Theorem 1 (Exact one-sided domination in L∞). For all permutations π,
MST_log(π) ≤ Reg_log(π).

Proof. For t≥0, let G(t) be the graph on P_π with an edge {u,v} whenever ||u−v||_∞ ≤ t, and let κ(t) be its number of connected components. For an MST whose L∞-edge lengths are {ℓ_e}, the layer-cake identity and Kruskal’s algorithm give
MST_log(π) = ∑_e log(1+ℓ_e) = ∫_0^∞ #(e:ℓ_e>t) dt/(1+t) = ∫_0^∞ (κ(t)−1) dt/(1+t).
(The last equality holds for all t except ties, which form a measure-zero set.)
We upper bound κ(t) via a sparse subgraph H(t). Process i=2,…,n and add to H(t):
- the time edge (i−1,i) if Δ_i ≤ t;
- the value-neighbor edge (i,j), where j<i is the largest index with |π(i)−π(j)|=1, if t_i ≤ t.
Each added edge has L∞-length ≤ t (time: ||p_i−p_{i−1}||_∞=max{1,Δ_i}; value: ||p_i−p_j||_∞=max{1,t_i}). Hence H(t)⊆G(t), so κ(t)≤κ_H(t). Expose vertices in increasing i. When i arrives, κ_H increases by 1 (for the new vertex) and decreases by 1 if at least one of the two edges is present (the vertex attaches to previous vertices), and possibly decreases further if both are present (merging two components). Thus the component count fails to drop back by 1 only if both edges are absent, i.e., if Δ_i>t and t_i>t. Starting from κ_H(1)=1 we obtain
κ(t) ≤ κ_H(t) ≤ 1 + |{ i∈{2,…,n} : Δ_i>t and t_i>t }|.
Integrating,
MST_log(π) ≤ ∫_0^∞ ∑_{i=2}^n 1[Δ_i>t and t_i>t] dt/(1+t) = ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+min{Δ_i,t_i}).
Finally, since r_i=min{d_i+t_i,i} and t_i≤i−1, we have r_i≥t_i. Hence log(1+min{Δ_i,t_i}) ≤ log(1+t_i) ≤ log(1+r_i). Summing over i gives MST_log(π) ≤ Reg_log(π).
∎

Corollary 2 (Domination for any norm; explicit constant). Let b:=sup_{||z||_∞=1} ||z|| ∈ [1,∞). Then for all π,
MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ (1 + (log b)/log 3) · Reg_log(π).

Proof. Let T_∞ be an L∞-MST. For any edge e, 1+||e|| ≤ b(1+||e||_∞), so log(1+||e||) ≤ log b + log(1+||e||_∞). Summing over the n−1 edges of T_∞,
MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ (n−1)·log b + MST_log(π) ≤ (n−1)·log b + Reg_log(π).
Since Reg_log(π) ≥ (n−1)·log 3, the additive term is absorbed to yield the stated factor. For L_p in R^2 one has b=2^{1/p}, giving MST_log^{(p)}(π) ≤ (1 + (log 2)/(p·log 3))·Reg_log(π).
∎

Theorem 3 (Universal logarithmic reverse bound). For any fixed norm ||·|| there exists c>0 such that for all π and n,
Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/c) · MST_log^{||·||}(π).

Proof. In a permutation grid, any two distinct points have both coordinate gaps ≥1. Thus every spanning-tree edge has length at least α and weight at least c:=log(1+α), with α=1,√2,2 respectively in L∞, L2, L1. More generally, by norm equivalence there is α>0 with ||z|| ≥ α||z||_∞, hence every edge length is ≥α. Therefore MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≥ (n−1)·c. On the other hand r_i≤i implies Reg_log(π) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+i) ≤ (n−1)·log(1+n). Dividing yields the claim.
∎

Theorem 4 (Separation; no reverse constant). There is no universal C with Reg_log(π) ≤ C·MST_log^{||·||}(π) for all π. In fact, for any fixed norm, there exist permutations with Reg_log/MST_log = Θ(log n).

Proof. Take the parity-block permutation for even n: list all even values in increasing order, then all odd values in increasing order; i.e., π(i)=2i for 1≤i≤n/2 and π(i)=2(i−n/2)−1 for i>n/2.
MST_log^{||·||}(π)=Θ(n): within each half, the time edges (i−1,i) have constant length, contributing Θ(n); one bridge connects the halves, costing O(log n). A matching Ω(n) lower bound holds since every MST has n−1 edges of weight ≥c>0 (Theorem 3), so MST_log^{||·||}(π)=Θ(n).
Reg_log(π)=Θ(n log n): in the first half (even block), no odd has appeared, so for 2≤i≤n/2 one has t_i=i−1 and d_i=1, hence r_i=i and ∑_{i=2}^{n/2} log(1+r_i)=Θ((n/2)·log n). In the second half (odd block), the nearest value-neighbor lies in the first half at temporal distance t_i=n/2 for all but the first odd, and d_i=2 (the unique even between consecutive odds has appeared), hence r_i=Θ(n) for almost all i, contributing Θ(log n) each; the first odd has r_i=Θ(n) as well. Thus the odd block contributes Θ((n/2)·log n). Summing gives Reg_log(π)=Θ(n log n). Therefore Reg_log/MST_log=Θ(log n).
∎

Consequences. Theorems 1–4 resolve the dominance questions:
- Reg dominates MST: MST_log(π) ≤ Reg_log(π) in L∞, and MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ (1 + (log b)/log 3)·Reg_log(π) for any fixed norm.
- MST does not dominate Reg by a constant: there are permutations with Reg_log/MST_log = Θ(log n).
- Universal upper bound: for all π, Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/c)·MST_log^{||·||}(π).
Hence the worst-case gap is Θ(log n) and this is optimal. All constants depend only on the norm and the log base.


=== Verifier Summary ===

We finalized a rigorous, self-contained resolution: (1) In L∞, MST_log ≤ Reg_log via Kruskal’s integral and a sparse H(t). (2) For any norm, MST_log^N ≤ (1+(log b_N)/log 3)·Reg_log. (3) No constant reverse bound: parity/mod-m families yield Reg/MST = Θ(log n). (4) Universal reverse bound Reg ≤ (log(1+n)/c_N)·MST_log^N. The Θ(log n) gap is tight. Output.md contains full proofs.

Summary of current understanding

- Definitions: P_π = {(i, π(i))}, MST_log uses weights w(u,v)=log(1+||u−v||). Reg_log(π)=∑_{i=2}^n log(1+r_i) with r_i=min(d_i+t_i, i), d_i counts prior values between π(i−1) and π(i), and t_i is the temporal distance to the most recent earlier value-neighbor (|Δ value|=1), defaulting to i−1 if none exists.

- One-sided domination (L∞): Using Kruskal’s integral identity, ∑_{e∈MST} log(1+ℓ_e) = ∫_0^∞ (κ(t)−1) dt/(1+t), where κ(t) is the number of components in the threshold graph with edges of L∞-length ≤ t. Build a sparse subgraph H(t): when processing p_i, add the time edge (i−1,i) if |π(i)−π(i−1)|≤t, and the value-neighbor edge to the most recent earlier neighbor if t_i≤t. Then κ_G(t) ≤ κ_H(t) ≤ 1 + |{i≥2: Δ_i>t and t_i>t}|. Integrating yields MST_log(L∞) ≤ ∑ log(1+min(Δ_i,t_i)) ≤ ∑ log(1+r_i) = Reg_log.

- Norm invariance: For any norm ||·|| with ||z|| ≤ b||z||∞, choose an L∞-MST T∞ and obtain MST_log(||·||) ≤ (n−1)log(1+b) + MST_log(L∞) ≤ (1 + log(1+b)/log 3)·Reg_log, since Reg_log ≥ (n−1)log 3.

- Separation (no reverse domination): Order values by residue classes mod m, listing each class block in increasing order. For fixed m, we can span each block by index-adjacent edges (each costs log(1+m) under L∞), and connect the blocks with O(m) bridges (each costs O(log n)). Hence MST_log = Θ(n). Meanwhile, for any r≥2 and any element v=r+k m of class r, the earlier neighbor v−1 lies in class r−1 exactly m_{r−1} positions earlier, so t_i = m_{r−1} = Θ(n/m); therefore Reg_log ≥ ∑_{r=2}^m m_r log(1+m_{r−1}) = Θ(n log(n/m)). For m constant (e.g., parity), Reg_log/MST_log = Θ(log n).

- Remarks: A previously attempted charge (linking the value-adjacency path edge length directly to t_i at the later endpoint) is invalid in general (the closest earlier neighbor might be v±2). The component-integral method avoids this pitfall.

Open directions

- Likely tight frontier: prove a universal upper bound Reg_log(π) ≤ O(log n)·MST_log(π) for all π, matching the Θ(log n) lower bound from mod-m families.
- Tighten constants in the domination for specific norms; compute best b for L1 and L2.
- Quantify leading constants for E[MST_log], E[Reg_log] under random π.


Addition: universal logarithmic upper bound

- Minimal MST edge weight: For any fixed norm N on R^2, there exists α_N>0 such that ||z||_N ≥ α_N||z||_∞ for all z. Since any two distinct points p_i=(i,π(i)), p_j differ by at least 1 in each coordinate, ||p_i−p_j||_∞ ≥ 1, hence ||p_i−p_j||_N ≥ α_N. Therefore every tree edge has weight ≥ log(1+α_N), so MST_log^N(π) ≥ (n−1)·log(1+α_N).
- Trivial Reg upper bound: r_i ≤ i implies Reg_log(π) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+i) ≤ (n−1)·log(1+n).
- Combining: Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/log(1+α_N)) · MST_log^N(π) for all π. In particular: L∞ gives factor log(1+n)/log 2; for L2, one may sharpen c_N using ||(1,1)||_2=√2 (so each edge has weight ≥ log(1+√2)); for L1 similarly ||(1,1)||_1=2.

Thus, universally Reg_log ≤ Θ(log n)·MST_log, matching the Θ(log n) lower bound from parity/mod-m constructions. This complements the established MST_log ≤ Reg_log (exact in L∞, constant-factor for any fixed norm).

Refined constants for norm lifting and universal upper bound

- Norm lifting (refinement): For any norm ||·|| with b := sup_{z≠0} ||z||/||z||_∞ ≥ 1, we have 1+||e|| ≤ b(1+||e||_∞) for any edge e, hence log(1+||e||) ≤ log b + log(1+||e||_∞). Summing over an L∞-MST gives MST_log^{||·||} ≤ (n−1)·log b + MST_log^{∞}.
  Combining with MST_log^{∞} ≤ Reg_log and Reg_log ≥ (n−1)·log 3 yields MST_log^{||·||} ≤ (1 + (log b)/log 3)·Reg_log.
  For L_p in R^2, b_p = 2^{1/p}, so C_p = 1 + (log 2)/(p·log 3).

- Universal upper bound Reg ≤ Θ(log n)·MST (constants): For permutation grids, any two distinct points have both coordinate gaps ≥1, so every MST edge under
  • L∞ has weight ≥ log 2;
  • L2 has weight ≥ log(1+√2);
  • L1 has weight ≥ log 3.
  Since r_i ≤ i, Reg_log(π) ≤ (n−1)·log(1+n). Therefore Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/c_N)·MST_log^N(π), where c_N is the per-edge lower-bound constant above. This gives a tight Θ(log n) worst-case factor, matching mod-m separations.

- Optional generalization: For any concave, nondecreasing φ with φ(0)=0, the L∞ integral method gives MST_φ(π) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n φ(min{Δ_i, t_i}).

Further refinements and generalizations

- Refined norm-lift constant: For any norm ||·|| with b := sup_{z≠0} ||z||/||z||_∞ ≥ 1, 1+||e|| ≤ b(1+||e||_∞) implies log(1+||e||) ≤ log b + log(1+||e||_∞). Thus MST_log^{||·||} ≤ (n−1)·log b + MST_log^{∞} ≤ (1 + (log b)/log 3)·Reg_log. For L_p in R^2: b_p = 2^{1/p}, so C_p = 1 + (log 2)/(p·log 3).

- Universal upper bound with explicit constants: Every MST edge has weight at least c_N := log(1+α_N), where α_N>0 satisfies ||z|| ≥ α_N||z||_∞. Hence MST_log^N ≥ (n−1)·c_N. Since r_i ≤ i, Reg_log ≤ (n−1)·log(1+n), giving Reg_log ≤ (log(1+n)/c_N)·MST_log^N. In particular: L∞: c_∞=log 2; L2: c_2=log(1+√2); L1: c_1=log 3.

- Concave-weight extension in L∞: For any concave, nondecreasing φ with φ(0)=0, Kruskal’s integral with the sparse H(t) yields MST_φ^{∞}(π) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n φ(min{Δ_i,t_i}) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n φ(r_i).

- Temporal-to-value pairing: Let pos[v] be index of value v and s_v=|pos[v+1]−pos[v]|. For I_val={i≥2: ∃ j<i with |π(i)−π(j)|=1}, the map sending i to v=min{π(i),π(j)} (j realizes t_i) is injective and t_i=s_v. Hence ∑_{i∈I_val} log(1+t_i) ≤ ∑_{v=1}^{n−1} log(1+s_v).

These complement the established results MST_log^{∞} ≤ Reg_log and the Θ(log n) tight separation via mod-m families.

# Rigorous Proofs



Theorem 1 (One-sided domination).
For the L∞ norm on R^2 and any permutation π, MST_log(π) ≤ Reg_log(π). For any fixed norm N, there exists a universal constant C_N such that MST_log^N(π) ≤ C_N·Reg_log(π) for all π.

Proof.
1) Kruskal integral identity for log weights. Let d(u,v) be the L∞ distance. For t≥0 let G(t) be the graph on P_π with edges {u,v} whenever d(u,v) ≤ t, and let κ(t) be the number of connected components of G(t). Let ℓ_1≤⋯≤ℓ_{n−1} be the L∞-lengths of the MST edges. Since log(1+x)=∫_0^x dt/(1+t),
∑_{j=1}^{n−1} log(1+ℓ_j) = ∫_0^∞ m(t) dt/(1+t), where m(t)=|{j: ℓ_j ≥ t}|.
By Kruskal’s algorithm, m(t) = κ(t) − 1. Hence
MST_log(L∞) = ∫_0^∞ (κ(t)−1) dt/(1+t).

2) A sparse super-bound on κ(t). Process points in time order i=1,…,n and build a graph H(t) by adding (to earlier vertices only):
- the time edge {i−1,i} if Δ_i := |π(i)−π(i−1)| ≤ t;
- the value-neighbor edge {j,i} where j<i achieves t_i:=min{i−j: |π(i)−π(j)|=1}, if t_i ≤ t (if no such j exists, we skip this edge).
Every inserted edge has L∞-length ≤ t, so H(t) is a subgraph of G(t), and κ(t) ≤ κ_H(t). Moreover, when adding p_i, if both Δ_i>t and t_i>t then no edge is added from p_i to the existing graph and the number of components increases by at most 1; otherwise p_i attaches (possibly merging components). Therefore κ_H(t) ≤ 1 + |{i≥2: Δ_i>t and t_i>t}|.
Combining with (1),
MST_log(L∞) ≤ ∫_0^∞ |{i≥2: Δ_i>t and t_i>t}| dt/(1+t)
= ∑_{i=2}^n ∫_0^{min(Δ_i,t_i)} dt/(1+t)
= ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+min(Δ_i,t_i)).
Since r_i := min(d_i+t_i, i) ≥ t_i, we get
MST_log(L∞) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+r_i) = Reg_log(π).

3) Norm lifting. For any norm N there is b_N>0 with ||z||_N ≤ b_N||z||_∞. For any spanning tree T,
∑_{e∈T} log(1+||e||_N) ≤ ∑_{e∈T} log(1+b_N||e||_∞) ≤ (n−1)log(1+b_N) + ∑_{e∈T} log(1+||e||_∞).
Choose T to be an L∞-MST and apply the L∞ bound:
MST_log^N(π) ≤ (n−1)log(1+b_N) + MST_log(L∞) ≤ (n−1)log(1+b_N) + Reg_log(π).
Since r_i ≥ 2 for all i≥2, Reg_log(π) ≥ (n−1)·log 3. Thus
MST_log^N(π) ≤ (1 + log(1+b_N)/log 3) · Reg_log(π) =: C_N·Reg_log(π).
This proves Theorem 1. ∎

Theorem 2 (Separation; no reverse domination).
There is no universal C>0 such that Reg_log(π) ≤ C·MST_log(π) for all π. In fact, there is a family with Reg_log/MST_log = Θ(log n).

Proof.
Fix an integer m≥2 and, for each n, order the values by residue classes modulo m: list all numbers congruent to 1 mod m in increasing order, then 2 mod m, …, then m mod m. Let m_r be the size of class r (m_r = ⌊(n−r)/m⌋+1 or ⌈n/m⌉; in any case m_r = Θ(n/m)).

MST upper bound (L∞). Within each residue class r, connect consecutive indices inside that block: each such edge has L∞-length m, hence weight log(1+m). Summed over all classes this contributes (n−m)·log(1+m). Add m−1 “bridging” edges to connect the m blocks arbitrarily; each has length O(n) and weight O(log n). Therefore MST_log(π) ≤ (n−m)·log(1+m) + O(m log n) = Θ(n) for fixed m. A matching lower bound Ω(n) holds because every edge in L∞ has length ≥1, so every tree edge costs at least log 2; hence MST_log(π) ≥ (n−1)·log 2.

Reg lower bound. Consider a value v=r+k m in class r≥2. Its earlier true neighbor v−1 lies in class r−1 and occurs exactly m_{r−1} indices earlier, so t_i = m_{r−1}. Hence r_i ≥ t_i and
Reg_log(π) ≥ ∑_{r=2}^m m_r·log(1+m_{r−1}) = Θ(n log(n/m)).
For fixed m (e.g., m=2), Reg_log(π) = Θ(n log n) while MST_log(π) = Θ(n), so Reg_log(π)/MST_log(π) = Θ(log n). ∎

Corollary (parity blocks). Taking m=2 (all odds, then all evens, or vice versa) yields Reg_log(π)=Θ(n log n) and MST_log(π)=Θ(n).


Theorem 3 (Universal logarithmic upper bound: Reg_log ≤ O(log n)·MST_log).
Let N be any fixed norm on R^2. There exists α_N>0 such that for all π ∈ S_n,
Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/log(1+α_N)) · MST_log^N(π).

Proof.
1) Minimal edge weight. Since all norms on R^2 are equivalent, there exists α_N>0 with ||z||_N ≥ α_N||z||_∞ for all z∈R^2. For any distinct p_i=(i,π(i)) and p_j, we have ||p_i−p_j||_∞ ≥ 1 (both coordinates differ by at least 1), hence ||p_i−p_j||_N ≥ α_N and w(p_i,p_j)=log(1+||p_i−p_j||_N) ≥ log(1+α_N). Any spanning tree has n−1 edges, so MST_log^N(π) ≥ (n−1)·log(1+α_N).
2) Trivial Reg upper bound. For each i≥2, r_i ≤ i, hence Reg_log(π)=∑_{i=2}^n log(1+r_i) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+i) ≤ (n−1)·log(1+n).
3) Divide the two bounds to obtain the claim. ∎

Remark 3.1 (Explicit constants for common norms). For L∞, α_∞=1 gives Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/log 2)·MST_log^∞(π). For L2, using that both coordinates differ, ||p_i−p_j||_2 ≥ √2 yields c_2=log(1+√2) and Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/log(1+√2))·MST_log^2(π). For L1, ||p_i−p_j||_1 ≥ 2 gives c_1=log 3 and Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/log 3)·MST_log^1(π).

Together with Theorem 1 (MST_log ≤ Reg_log for L∞ and constant-factor for any norm) and Theorem 2 (mod-m separation giving Reg_log/MST_log = Θ(log n)), this characterizes the worst-case relationship up to a tight Θ(log n) factor.

Refinement: improved constants for general norms and L_p

Lemma (Refined norm lift). Let ||·|| be any norm on R^2 and set b := sup_{z≠0} ||z||/||z||_∞. For any permutation π,
MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ (n−1)·log b + MST_log^{∞}(π).

Proof. For any edge e, ||e|| ≤ b||e||_∞, hence 1+||e|| ≤ b(1+||e||_∞) and log(1+||e||) ≤ log b + log(1+||e||_∞). Summing over the n−1 edges of an L∞-MST yields the claim. ∎

Corollary (Constant-factor domination via Reg_log). For any norm as above and any π,
MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ (1 + (\log b)/(\log 3)) · Reg_log(π).

Proof. Use the lemma and MST_log^{∞}(π) ≤ Reg_log(π), and absorb the additive (n−1)·log b by Reg_log ≥ (n−1)·log 3. ∎

Corollary (Explicit L_p constants). In R^2, for 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞, b_p = sup_{z≠0} ||z||_p/||z||_∞ = 2^{1/p}. Hence for all π,
MST_log^{(p)}(π) ≤ \Big(1 + \frac{\log 2}{p\,\log 3}\Big) · Reg_log(π).

Remark (General concave weights in L∞). Let φ:[0,∞)→[0,∞) be concave, nondecreasing, φ(0)=0. Then the Kruskal integral with φ′ and the same H(t) yield
MST_φ^{∞}(π) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n φ(min{Δ_i, t_i}).

Proposition (Concave-weight extension in L∞).
Let φ:[0,∞)→[0,∞) be nondecreasing, concave, with φ(0)=0. For any permutation π,
\[\mathrm{MST}_{\varphi}^{\,\infty}(\pi) \le \sum_{i=2}^n \varphi\bigl(\min\{\Delta_i, t_i\}\bigr) \le \sum_{i=2}^n \varphi(r_i).\]

Proof.
Let G(t) be the threshold graph on P_π with edges of L∞-length ≤ t and κ(t) its number of components. By the Kruskal integral for concave weights, there exists a nonincreasing f≥0 with φ(x)=∫_0^x f(u)du and
\[\sum_{e\in \mathrm{MST}} \varphi(\ell_e) = \int_0^{\infty} f(t)\,(\kappa(t)-1)\,dt.\]
Construct H(t) by adding, for each i≥2, the time edge (i−1,i) if Δ_i≤t and the most recent value-neighbor edge (i,j) if t_i≤t. Then H(t)⊆G(t), so κ(t)≤κ_H(t). Scanning i in order, κ_H(t)−1 ≤ |{i≥2: Δ_i>t and t_i>t}|. Hence
\[\mathrm{MST}_{\varphi}^{\,\infty}(\pi) \le \int_0^{\infty} f(t)\,|\{i\ge 2: \min(\Delta_i,t_i)>t\}|\,dt = \sum_{i=2}^n \int_0^{\min(\Delta_i,t_i)} f(t)\,dt = \sum_{i=2}^n \varphi(\min\{\Delta_i,t_i\}).\]
Since r_i\ge t_i and φ is nondecreasing, the second inequality follows. ∎

Lemma (Temporal-to-value pairing).
Let pos[v] be the index with π(pos[v])=v and s_v=|pos[v+1]−pos[v]|. For I_val={i≥2: ∃ j<i with |π(i)−π(j)|=1},
\[\sum_{i\in I_{val}} \log(1+t_i) \le \sum_{v=1}^{n-1} \log(1+s_v).\]

Proof.
For each i∈I_val, let j attain t_i and set v=min{π(i),π(j)}. Then {π(i),π(j)}={v,v+1} and t_i=|i−j|=|pos[v+1]−pos[v]|=s_v. Only the later of pos[v],pos[v+1] can map to v, so the map i↦v is injective. Summing gives the inequality. ∎

Asymptotic comparison between MST_log and Reg_log

Setup. Fix an integer n≥2 and a permutation π∈S_n. Let P_π={p_i=(i,π(i)) : i=1,…,n}⊂R^2. Fix a norm ||·|| on R^2 and a logarithm base (changing either only rescales constants). For u,v∈P_π define the edge weight w(u,v)=log(1+||u−v||). Let MST_log^{||·||}(π) be the total w-weight of a minimum spanning tree on P_π.

For i≥2 define
- Δ_i := |π(i)−π(i−1)|,
- t_i := min{i−j : 1≤j<i and |π(i)−π(j)|=1}, with t_i := i−1 if no such j exists,
- d_i := 1 + #{ k<i : min(π(i−1),π(i)) < π(k) < max(π(i−1),π(i)) },
- r_i := min{ d_i + t_i, i }.
Set Reg_log(π) := ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+r_i). Note that for all i≥2, d_i≥1 and t_i≥1, hence r_i≥2 and log(1+r_i)≥log 3.

We write MST_log(π) for the L∞ case (||·||=||·||_∞). The main results resolve the dominance questions up to optimal Θ(log n) factors.

Theorem 1 (Exact one-sided domination in L∞). For all permutations π,
MST_log(π) ≤ Reg_log(π).

Proof. For t≥0, let G(t) be the graph on P_π with an edge {u,v} whenever ||u−v||_∞ ≤ t, and let κ(t) be its number of connected components. For an MST whose L∞-edge lengths are {ℓ_e}, the layer-cake identity and Kruskal’s algorithm give
MST_log(π) = ∑_e log(1+ℓ_e) = ∫_0^∞ #(e:ℓ_e>t) dt/(1+t) = ∫_0^∞ (κ(t)−1) dt/(1+t).
(The last equality holds for all t except ties, which form a measure-zero set.)
We upper bound κ(t) via a sparse subgraph H(t). Process i=2,…,n and add to H(t):
- the time edge (i−1,i) if Δ_i ≤ t;
- the value-neighbor edge (i,j), where j<i is the largest index with |π(i)−π(j)|=1, if t_i ≤ t.
Each added edge has L∞-length ≤ t (time: ||p_i−p_{i−1}||_∞=max{1,Δ_i}; value: ||p_i−p_j||_∞=max{1,t_i}). Hence H(t)⊆G(t), so κ(t)≤κ_H(t). Expose vertices in increasing i. When i arrives, κ_H increases by 1 (for the new vertex) and decreases by 1 if at least one of the two edges is present (the vertex attaches to previous vertices), and possibly decreases further if both are present (merging two components). Thus the component count fails to drop back by 1 only if both edges are absent, i.e., if Δ_i>t and t_i>t. Starting from κ_H(1)=1 we obtain
κ(t) ≤ κ_H(t) ≤ 1 + |{ i∈{2,…,n} : Δ_i>t and t_i>t }|.
Integrating,
MST_log(π) ≤ ∫_0^∞ ∑_{i=2}^n 1[Δ_i>t and t_i>t] dt/(1+t) = ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+min{Δ_i,t_i}).
Finally, since r_i=min{d_i+t_i,i} and t_i≤i−1, we have r_i≥t_i. Hence log(1+min{Δ_i,t_i}) ≤ log(1+t_i) ≤ log(1+r_i). Summing over i gives MST_log(π) ≤ Reg_log(π).
∎

Corollary 2 (Domination for any norm; explicit constant). Let b:=sup_{||z||_∞=1} ||z|| ∈ [1,∞). Then for all π,
MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ (1 + (log b)/log 3) · Reg_log(π).

Proof. Let T_∞ be an L∞-MST. For any edge e, 1+||e|| ≤ b(1+||e||_∞), so log(1+||e||) ≤ log b + log(1+||e||_∞). Summing over the n−1 edges of T_∞,
MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ (n−1)·log b + MST_log(π) ≤ (n−1)·log b + Reg_log(π).
Since Reg_log(π) ≥ (n−1)·log 3, the additive term is absorbed to yield the stated factor. For L_p in R^2 one has b=2^{1/p}, giving MST_log^{(p)}(π) ≤ (1 + (log 2)/(p·log 3))·Reg_log(π).
∎

Theorem 3 (Universal logarithmic reverse bound). For any fixed norm ||·|| there exists c>0 such that for all π and n,
Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/c) · MST_log^{||·||}(π).

Proof. In a permutation grid, any two distinct points have both coordinate gaps ≥1. Thus every spanning-tree edge has length at least α and weight at least c:=log(1+α), with α=1,√2,2 respectively in L∞, L2, L1. More generally, by norm equivalence there is α>0 with ||z|| ≥ α||z||_∞, hence every edge length is ≥α. Therefore MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≥ (n−1)·c. On the other hand r_i≤i implies Reg_log(π) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+i) ≤ (n−1)·log(1+n). Dividing yields the claim.
∎

Theorem 4 (Separation; no reverse constant). There is no universal C with Reg_log(π) ≤ C·MST_log^{||·||}(π) for all π. In fact, for any fixed norm, there exist permutations with Reg_log/MST_log = Θ(log n).

Proof. Take the parity-block permutation for even n: list all even values in increasing order, then all odd values in increasing order; i.e., π(i)=2i for 1≤i≤n/2 and π(i)=2(i−n/2)−1 for i>n/2.
MST_log^{||·||}(π)=Θ(n): within each half, the time edges (i−1,i) have constant length, contributing Θ(n); one bridge connects the halves, costing O(log n). A matching Ω(n) lower bound holds since every MST has n−1 edges of weight ≥c>0 (Theorem 3), so MST_log^{||·||}(π)=Θ(n).
Reg_log(π)=Θ(n log n): in the first half (even block), no odd has appeared, so for 2≤i≤n/2 one has t_i=i−1 and d_i=1, hence r_i=i and ∑_{i=2}^{n/2} log(1+r_i)=Θ((n/2)·log n). In the second half (odd block), the nearest value-neighbor lies in the first half at temporal distance t_i=n/2 for all but the first odd, and d_i=2 (the unique even between consecutive odds has appeared), hence r_i=Θ(n) for almost all i, contributing Θ(log n) each; the first odd has r_i=Θ(n) as well. Thus the odd block contributes Θ((n/2)·log n). Summing gives Reg_log(π)=Θ(n log n). Therefore Reg_log/MST_log=Θ(log n).
∎

Consequences. Theorems 1–4 resolve the dominance questions:
- Reg dominates MST: MST_log(π) ≤ Reg_log(π) in L∞, and MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ (1 + (log b)/log 3)·Reg_log(π) for any fixed norm.
- MST does not dominate Reg by a constant: there are permutations with Reg_log/MST_log = Θ(log n).
- Universal upper bound: for all π, Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/c)·MST_log^{||·||}(π).
Hence the worst-case gap is Θ(log n) and this is optimal. All constants depend only on the norm and the log base.
