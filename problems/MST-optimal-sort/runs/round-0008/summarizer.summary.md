We proved MST_log(π) ≤ Reg_log(π) for the L∞ norm by applying Kruskal’s integral identity and bounding component counts via a sparse threshold graph H(t). Norm equivalence lifts this to MST_log^N(π) ≤ C_N·Reg_log(π) for any fixed norm (explicit C_N from operator-norm ratio). Conversely, residue-class (mod-m, e.g. parity) permutations satisfy MST_log=Θ(n) but Reg_log=Θ(n log n), so Reg_log/MST_log=Θ(log n) and no universal constant reverses the inequality. A per-edge lower bound on MST yields Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/c_N)·MST_log^N(π) with explicit c_N for common norms, hence the worst-case multiplicative gap is Θ(log n) and tight. Extensions include refined constants for L_p, a concave-weight generalization, and a temporal→value pairing lemma.
