{"summary_md":"We proved MST_log(π) ≤ Reg_log(π) for the L∞ norm by applying Kruskal’s integral identity and bounding component counts via a sparse threshold graph H(t). Norm equivalence lifts this to MST_log^N(π) ≤ C_N·Reg_log(π) for any fixed norm (explicit C_N from operator-norm ratio). Conversely, residue-class (mod-m, e.g. parity) permutations satisfy MST_log=Θ(n) but Reg_log=Θ(n log n), so Reg_log/MST_log=Θ(log n) and no universal constant reverses the inequality. A per-edge lower bound on MST yields Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/c_N)·MST_log^N(π) with explicit c_N for common norms, hence the worst-case multiplicative gap is Θ(log n) and tight. Extensions include refined constants for L_p, a concave-weight generalization, and a temporal→value pairing lemma.","one_line_summary":"MST_log ≤ C·Reg_log; reverse fails — worst-case gap Θ(log n).","highlights":["Kruskal-integral + sparse H(t) yields MST_log^{∞}(π) ≤ ∑_i log(1+min(Δ_i,t_i)) ≤ Reg_log(π).","For any fixed norm N, MST_log^N(π) ≤ C_N·Reg_log(π) via norm-lifting (C_N from ||·||/||·||_∞).","Residue-class (mod-m, parity) permutations give MST_log=Θ(n) but Reg_log=Θ(n log n), so Reg_log/MST_log=Θ(log n).","Universal reverse bound: Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/c_N)·MST_log^N(π) with explicit c_N for L∞, L2, L1.","Therefore the worst-case multiplicative gap between the measures is Θ(log n), and this factor is tight."],"next_questions":["Optimize/compute best constants C_N and c_N for common norms (L1,L2,L∞).","Determine leading constants/asymptotics for E[MST_log] and E[Reg_log] under a uniform random permutation.","Search for (or rule out) permutation families with separation > Θ(log n).","Research Notes","Current Proofs"]}
