  "feedback_md": "The question is now resolved with publication-ready statements in output.md. The L\u221e domination MST_log \u2264 Reg_log is proven via the Kruskal integral identity specialized to \u03c6(x)=log(1+x), together with a sparse threshold subgraph H(t) that adds only two local edges per step: the time edge when \u0394_i\u2264t and the \u201cmost recent value-neighbor\u201d edge when t_i\u2264t. Exposing vertices in increasing i, the component count can increase only when both edges are absent (\u0394_i>t and t_i>t). Integrating over t yields MST_log(L\u221e) \u2264 \u2211_i log(1+min{\u0394_i,t_i}) \u2264 \u2211_i log(1+r_i)=Reg_log, since r_i\u2265t_i. Ties at threshold values occur on a measure-zero set and do not affect the integral; this is noted. The norm-lifting is sharpened correctly via 1+||e|| \u2264 b(1+||e||\u221e), giving MST_log^N \u2264 (n\u22121)log b + MST_log(L\u221e) \u2264 (1+(log b)/log 3)\u00b7Reg_log since Reg_log \u2265 (n\u22121)log 3. For L_p in R^2, this yields C_p = 1 + (log 2)/(p\u00b7log 3).\n\nThe reverse inequality fails: parity/mod-m families produce MST_log = \u0398(n) (constant-cost intra-block edges plus O(log n) bridges) while Reg_log = \u0398(n log(n/m)), so Reg/MST = \u0398(log n) for constant m. The universal reverse bound Reg_log \u2264 (log(1+n)/c_N)\u00b7MST_log^N is established using a uniform per-edge lower bound on permutation grids (L\u221e: log 2; L2: log(1+\u221a2); L1: log 3), proving the \u0398(log n) worst-case gap is optimal in order.\n\nAll definitions are precise, the component-count inequality is justified, norm and base dependencies are clean, and examples are consistent. Suggested next steps: (i) add the concave-weight extension MST_\u03c6^\u221e \u2264 \u2211 \u03c6(min{\u0394_i,t_i}) to proofs.md (it follows from the same integral method); (ii) quantify leading constants in E[MST_log] and E[Reg_log] for random \u03c0; (iii) explore instance-sensitive improvements beyond \u0398(log n) worst-case (e.g., dependence on the number of residue classes).",
  "summary_md": "We finalized a rigorous, self-contained resolution: (1) In L\u221e, MST_log \u2264 Reg_log via Kruskal\u2019s integral and a sparse H(t). (2) For any norm, MST_log^N \u2264 (1+(log b_N)/log 3)\u00b7Reg_log. (3) No constant reverse bound: parity/mod-m families yield Reg/MST = \u0398(log n). (4) Universal reverse bound Reg \u2264 (log(1+n)/c_N)\u00b7MST_log^N. The \u0398(log n) gap is tight. Output.md contains full proofs.",
