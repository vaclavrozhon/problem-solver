=== SYSTEM ===
You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md, proofs.md, and output.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers
- notes.md (informal progress & exploratory work so far)
- proofs.md (rigorous proofs & detailed mathematics so far)
- output.md (main results found so far)

**Three-tier file system guidelines**:
- **notes.md**: Readable running log of exploratory work, intuitions, failed attempts, ideas. Prefer appending. Replace only if old notes are clearly misleading. Should be self-contained.
- **proofs.md**: Complete rigorous mathematical proofs with full details. Think twice before adding anything. Contains proven lemmas, theorems, and detailed derivations. Only add mathematically verified content here.
- **output.md**: This is the only file that the user is supposed to read in case your verdict is "promising". It has to be self-contained. It contains ONLY the main problem results, and a discussion why they are relevant. It is extremely selective. Think twice before promoting proofs from proofs.md to output.md. Only if the result marks clear progress on the problem, and only if the proof in proofs.md has been thoroughly vetted by provers and you, it can join output.md. Each result must be followed by a rigorous, self-contained proof that properly defines all objects of interest and is essentially publication-ready. 

Tasks:
1) Audit rigor: identify unjustified steps, false statements, missing lemmas; produce minimal counterexamples.
2) Triage value: separate genuine progress from noise.
3) Guide next steps: propose what provers should try next.

# Problem: Asymptotic Dominance Between an MST–Log Distance Measure and **Reg**

Let \(n \in \mathbb{N}\) and let \(\pi \in S_n\) be a permutation. Represent the input as
\[
P_\pi = \{\,p_i = (i,\pi(i)) : i=1,\dots,n\,\}\subset \{1,\dots,n\}^2 .
\]

Fix any norm \(\|\cdot\|\) on \(\mathbb{R}^2\) (e.g., \(L_1, L_2,\) or \(L_\infty\)). All choices are equivalent up to constant factors, so asymptotic comparisons are norm-invariant.

---

## Measure 1: \(\mathrm{MST}_{\log}(\pi)\)

Define edge weights between points \(p_i,p_j\) by  
\[
w(p_i,p_j)=\log\!\bigl(1+\|p_i-p_j\|\bigr),
\]  
where the logarithm base is fixed but arbitrary.

Let \(T\) be a minimum spanning tree of the complete graph on \(P_\pi\) with weights \(w\). Set  
\[
\boxed{\mathrm{MST}_{\log}(\pi)=\sum_{e\in E(T)} w(e).}
\]

---

## Measure 2: \(\mathrm{Reg}_{\log}(\pi)\)

For \(i \ge 2\), let

* **Value-distance from the previous key**  
  \[
  d_i = 1 + \#\{\,k < i : \min(\pi(i-1),\pi(i)) < \pi(k) < \max(\pi(i-1),\pi(i))\,\}.
  \]

* **Temporal distance to the most recent true neighbor in value order**  
  \[
  t_i = \min\{\, i-j : 1 \le j < i,\; |\pi(i)-\pi(j)| = 1 \,\},
  \]  
  with \(t_i = i-1\) if no such \(j\) exists.

* **Regional radius**  
  \[
  r_i = \min\{\, d_i + t_i,\; i \,\}.
  \]

Define the logged regional cost  
\[
\boxed{\mathrm{Reg}_{\log}(\pi) = \sum_{i=2}^n \log(1 + r_i).}
\]

Using \(\log(1+r_i)\) (rather than \(r_i-1\)) ensures that a **random permutation** has  
\[
\mathrm{Reg}_{\log}(\pi) = \Theta(n \log n),
\]  
matching the \(\Theta(n \log n)\) comparisons needed for typical sorting.  
Without the logarithm, \(\sum (r_i-1)\) for a random permutation is \(\Theta(n^2)\), which is too large compared to standard sorting bounds.

---

## Asymptotic Dominance Questions

>    \(\mathrm{Reg}_{\log}(\pi_n)/\mathrm{MST}_{\log}(\pi_n)\)  
>    diverges as \(n \to \infty\).

**Notes.**

* The choice of norm and log base only rescales values by constants.  
* Using \(\log(1+r_i)\) aligns \(\mathrm{Reg}_{\log}\) with classical adaptive-sorting analyses where a random permutation costs \(\Theta(n\log n)\).  
* One may also consider variants such as asking whether  
  \[
  C^{-1}\mathrm{Reg}_{\log}(\pi)\le \mathrm{MST}_{\log}(\pi)\le C\,\mathrm{Reg}_{\log}(\pi)
  \]  
  holds for some universal \(C\).

# Research Notes



Summary of current understanding

- Definitions: P_π = {(i, π(i))}, MST_log uses weights w(u,v)=log(1+||u−v||). Reg_log(π)=∑_{i=2}^n log(1+r_i) with r_i=min(d_i+t_i, i), d_i counts prior values between π(i−1) and π(i), and t_i is the temporal distance to the most recent earlier value-neighbor (|Δ value|=1), defaulting to i−1 if none exists.

- One-sided domination (L∞): Using Kruskal’s integral identity, ∑_{e∈MST} log(1+ℓ_e) = ∫_0^∞ (κ(t)−1) dt/(1+t), where κ(t) is the number of components in the threshold graph with edges of L∞-length ≤ t. Build a sparse subgraph H(t): when processing p_i, add the time edge (i−1,i) if |π(i)−π(i−1)|≤t, and the value-neighbor edge to the most recent earlier neighbor if t_i≤t. Then κ_G(t) ≤ κ_H(t) ≤ 1 + |{i≥2: Δ_i>t and t_i>t}|. Integrating yields MST_log(L∞) ≤ ∑ log(1+min(Δ_i,t_i)) ≤ ∑ log(1+r_i) = Reg_log.

- Norm invariance: For any norm ||·|| with ||z|| ≤ b||z||∞, choose an L∞-MST T∞ and obtain MST_log(||·||) ≤ (n−1)log(1+b) + MST_log(L∞) ≤ (1 + log(1+b)/log 3)·Reg_log, since Reg_log ≥ (n−1)log 3.

- Separation (no reverse domination): Order values by residue classes mod m, listing each class block in increasing order. For fixed m, we can span each block by index-adjacent edges (each costs log(1+m) under L∞), and connect the blocks with O(m) bridges (each costs O(log n)). Hence MST_log = Θ(n). Meanwhile, for any r≥2 and any element v=r+k m of class r, the earlier neighbor v−1 lies in class r−1 exactly m_{r−1} positions earlier, so t_i = m_{r−1} = Θ(n/m); therefore Reg_log ≥ ∑_{r=2}^m m_r log(1+m_{r−1}) = Θ(n log(n/m)). For m constant (e.g., parity), Reg_log/MST_log = Θ(log n).

- Remarks: A previously attempted charge (linking the value-adjacency path edge length directly to t_i at the later endpoint) is invalid in general (the closest earlier neighbor might be v±2). The component-integral method avoids this pitfall.

Open directions

- Likely tight frontier: prove a universal upper bound Reg_log(π) ≤ O(log n)·MST_log(π) for all π, matching the Θ(log n) lower bound from mod-m families.
- Tighten constants in the domination for specific norms; compute best b for L1 and L2.
- Quantify leading constants for E[MST_log], E[Reg_log] under random π.


Addition: universal logarithmic upper bound

- Minimal MST edge weight: For any fixed norm N on R^2, there exists α_N>0 such that ||z||_N ≥ α_N||z||_∞ for all z. Since any two distinct points p_i=(i,π(i)), p_j differ by at least 1 in each coordinate, ||p_i−p_j||_∞ ≥ 1, hence ||p_i−p_j||_N ≥ α_N. Therefore every tree edge has weight ≥ log(1+α_N), so MST_log^N(π) ≥ (n−1)·log(1+α_N).
- Trivial Reg upper bound: r_i ≤ i implies Reg_log(π) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+i) ≤ (n−1)·log(1+n).
- Combining: Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/log(1+α_N)) · MST_log^N(π) for all π. In particular: L∞ gives factor log(1+n)/log 2; for L2, one may sharpen c_N using ||(1,1)||_2=√2 (so each edge has weight ≥ log(1+√2)); for L1 similarly ||(1,1)||_1=2.

Thus, universally Reg_log ≤ Θ(log n)·MST_log, matching the Θ(log n) lower bound from parity/mod-m constructions. This complements the established MST_log ≤ Reg_log (exact in L∞, constant-factor for any fixed norm).

Refined constants for norm lifting and universal upper bound

- Norm lifting (refinement): For any norm ||·|| with b := sup_{z≠0} ||z||/||z||_∞ ≥ 1, we have 1+||e|| ≤ b(1+||e||_∞) for any edge e, hence log(1+||e||) ≤ log b + log(1+||e||_∞). Summing over an L∞-MST gives MST_log^{||·||} ≤ (n−1)·log b + MST_log^{∞}.
  Combining with MST_log^{∞} ≤ Reg_log and Reg_log ≥ (n−1)·log 3 yields MST_log^{||·||} ≤ (1 + (log b)/log 3)·Reg_log.
  For L_p in R^2, b_p = 2^{1/p}, so C_p = 1 + (log 2)/(p·log 3).

- Universal upper bound Reg ≤ Θ(log n)·MST (constants): For permutation grids, any two distinct points have both coordinate gaps ≥1, so every MST edge under
  • L∞ has weight ≥ log 2;
  • L2 has weight ≥ log(1+√2);
  • L1 has weight ≥ log 3.
  Since r_i ≤ i, Reg_log(π) ≤ (n−1)·log(1+n). Therefore Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/c_N)·MST_log^N(π), where c_N is the per-edge lower-bound constant above. This gives a tight Θ(log n) worst-case factor, matching mod-m separations.

- Optional generalization: For any concave, nondecreasing φ with φ(0)=0, the L∞ integral method gives MST_φ(π) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n φ(min{Δ_i, t_i}).

Further refinements and generalizations

- Refined norm-lift constant: For any norm ||·|| with b := sup_{z≠0} ||z||/||z||_∞ ≥ 1, 1+||e|| ≤ b(1+||e||_∞) implies log(1+||e||) ≤ log b + log(1+||e||_∞). Thus MST_log^{||·||} ≤ (n−1)·log b + MST_log^{∞} ≤ (1 + (log b)/log 3)·Reg_log. For L_p in R^2: b_p = 2^{1/p}, so C_p = 1 + (log 2)/(p·log 3).

- Universal upper bound with explicit constants: Every MST edge has weight at least c_N := log(1+α_N), where α_N>0 satisfies ||z|| ≥ α_N||z||_∞. Hence MST_log^N ≥ (n−1)·c_N. Since r_i ≤ i, Reg_log ≤ (n−1)·log(1+n), giving Reg_log ≤ (log(1+n)/c_N)·MST_log^N. In particular: L∞: c_∞=log 2; L2: c_2=log(1+√2); L1: c_1=log 3.

- Concave-weight extension in L∞: For any concave, nondecreasing φ with φ(0)=0, Kruskal’s integral with the sparse H(t) yields MST_φ^{∞}(π) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n φ(min{Δ_i,t_i}) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n φ(r_i).

- Temporal-to-value pairing: Let pos[v] be index of value v and s_v=|pos[v+1]−pos[v]|. For I_val={i≥2: ∃ j<i with |π(i)−π(j)|=1}, the map sending i to v=min{π(i),π(j)} (j realizes t_i) is injective and t_i=s_v. Hence ∑_{i∈I_val} log(1+t_i) ≤ ∑_{v=1}^{n−1} log(1+s_v).

These complement the established results MST_log^{∞} ≤ Reg_log and the Θ(log n) tight separation via mod-m families.

Asymptotic comparison between MST_log and Reg_log

Setup. Fix an integer n≥2 and a permutation π∈S_n. Let P_π={p_i=(i,π(i)) : i=1,…,n}⊂R^2. Fix a norm ||·|| on R^2 and a logarithm base (changing either only rescales constants). For u,v∈P_π define the edge weight w(u,v)=log(1+||u−v||). Let MST_log^{||·||}(π) be the total w-weight of a minimum spanning tree on P_π.

For i≥2 define
- Δ_i := |π(i)−π(i−1)|,
- t_i := min{i−j : 1≤j<i and |π(i)−π(j)|=1}, with t_i := i−1 if no such j exists,
- d_i := 1 + #{ k<i : min(π(i−1),π(i)) < π(k) < max(π(i−1),π(i)) },
- r_i := min{ d_i + t_i, i }.
Set Reg_log(π) := ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+r_i). Note that for all i≥2, d_i≥1 and t_i≥1, hence r_i≥2 and log(1+r_i)≥log 3.

We write MST_log(π) for the L∞ case (||·||=||·||_∞). The main results resolve the dominance questions up to optimal Θ(log n) factors.

Theorem 1 (Exact one-sided domination in L∞). For all permutations π,
MST_log(π) ≤ Reg_log(π).

Proof. For t≥0, let G(t) be the graph on P_π with an edge {u,v} whenever ||u−v||_∞ ≤ t, and let κ(t) be its number of connected components. For an MST whose L∞-edge lengths are {ℓ_e}, the layer-cake identity and Kruskal’s algorithm give
MST_log(π) = ∑_e log(1+ℓ_e) = ∫_0^∞ #(e:ℓ_e>t) dt/(1+t) = ∫_0^∞ (κ(t)−1) dt/(1+t).
(The last equality holds for all t except ties, which form a measure-zero set.)
We upper bound κ(t) via a sparse subgraph H(t). Process i=2,…,n and add to H(t):
- the time edge (i−1,i) if Δ_i ≤ t;
- the value-neighbor edge (i,j), where j<i is the largest index with |π(i)−π(j)|=1, if t_i ≤ t.
Each added edge has L∞-length ≤ t (time: ||p_i−p_{i−1}||_∞=max{1,Δ_i}; value: ||p_i−p_j||_∞=max{1,t_i}). Hence H(t)⊆G(t), so κ(t)≤κ_H(t). Expose vertices in increasing i. When i arrives, κ_H increases by 1 (for the new vertex) and decreases by 1 if at least one of the two edges is present (the vertex attaches to previous vertices), and possibly decreases further if both are present (merging two components). Thus the component count fails to drop back by 1 only if both edges are absent, i.e., if Δ_i>t and t_i>t. Starting from κ_H(1)=1 we obtain
κ(t) ≤ κ_H(t) ≤ 1 + |{ i∈{2,…,n} : Δ_i>t and t_i>t }|.
Integrating,
MST_log(π) ≤ ∫_0^∞ ∑_{i=2}^n 1[Δ_i>t and t_i>t] dt/(1+t) = ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+min{Δ_i,t_i}).
Finally, since r_i=min{d_i+t_i,i} and t_i≤i−1, we have r_i≥t_i. Hence log(1+min{Δ_i,t_i}) ≤ log(1+t_i) ≤ log(1+r_i). Summing over i gives MST_log(π) ≤ Reg_log(π).
∎

Corollary 2 (Domination for any norm; explicit constant). Let b:=sup_{||z||_∞=1} ||z|| ∈ [1,∞). Then for all π,
MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ (1 + (log b)/log 3) · Reg_log(π).

Proof. Let T_∞ be an L∞-MST. For any edge e, 1+||e|| ≤ b(1+||e||_∞), so log(1+||e||) ≤ log b + log(1+||e||_∞). Summing over the n−1 edges of T_∞,
MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ (n−1)·log b + MST_log(π) ≤ (n−1)·log b + Reg_log(π).
Since Reg_log(π) ≥ (n−1)·log 3, the additive term is absorbed to yield the stated factor. For L_p in R^2 one has b=2^{1/p}, giving MST_log^{(p)}(π) ≤ (1 + (log 2)/(p·log 3))·Reg_log(π).
∎

Theorem 3 (Universal logarithmic reverse bound). For any fixed norm ||·|| there exists c>0 such that for all π and n,
Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/c) · MST_log^{||·||}(π).

Proof. In a permutation grid, any two distinct points have both coordinate gaps ≥1. Thus every spanning-tree edge has length at least α and weight at least c:=log(1+α), with α=1,√2,2 respectively in L∞, L2, L1. More generally, by norm equivalence there is α>0 with ||z|| ≥ α||z||_∞, hence every edge length is ≥α. Therefore MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≥ (n−1)·c. On the other hand r_i≤i implies Reg_log(π) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+i) ≤ (n−1)·log(1+n). Dividing yields the claim.
∎

Theorem 4 (Separation; no reverse constant). There is no universal C with Reg_log(π) ≤ C·MST_log^{||·||}(π) for all π. In fact, for any fixed norm, there exist permutations with Reg_log/MST_log = Θ(log n).

Proof. Take the parity-block permutation for even n: list all even values in increasing order, then all odd values in increasing order; i.e., π(i)=2i for 1≤i≤n/2 and π(i)=2(i−n/2)−1 for i>n/2.
MST_log^{||·||}(π)=Θ(n): within each half, the time edges (i−1,i) have constant length, contributing Θ(n); one bridge connects the halves, costing O(log n). A matching Ω(n) lower bound holds since every MST has n−1 edges of weight ≥c>0 (Theorem 3), so MST_log^{||·||}(π)=Θ(n).
Reg_log(π)=Θ(n log n): in the first half (even block), no odd has appeared, so for 2≤i≤n/2 one has t_i=i−1 and d_i=1, hence r_i=i and ∑_{i=2}^{n/2} log(1+r_i)=Θ((n/2)·log n). In the second half (odd block), the nearest value-neighbor lies in the first half at temporal distance t_i=n/2 for all but the first odd, and d_i=2 (the unique even between consecutive odds has appeared), hence r_i=Θ(n) for almost all i, contributing Θ(log n) each; the first odd has r_i=Θ(n) as well. Thus the odd block contributes Θ((n/2)·log n). Summing gives Reg_log(π)=Θ(n log n). Therefore Reg_log/MST_log=Θ(log n).
∎

Consequences. Theorems 1–4 resolve the dominance questions:
- Reg dominates MST: MST_log(π) ≤ Reg_log(π) in L∞, and MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ (1 + (log b)/log 3)·Reg_log(π) for any fixed norm.
- MST does not dominate Reg by a constant: there are permutations with Reg_log/MST_log = Θ(log n).
- Universal upper bound: for all π, Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/c)·MST_log^{||·||}(π).
Hence the worst-case gap is Θ(log n) and this is optimal. All constants depend only on the norm and the log base.

# Asymptotic comparison between MST_log and Reg_log

We work on the point set P_π = {(i, π(i)) : i = 1,…,n} ⊂ R^2. Fix a norm ||·|| on R^2 and a logarithm base (changing either only rescales constants). For u,v∈P_π define the edge weight w(u,v) = log(1 + ||u − v||). Let MST_log^{||·||}(π) be the total w-weight of a minimum spanning tree (MST) on P_π.

For i ≥ 2 set
- Δ_i := |π(i) − π(i−1)|,
- t_i := min{i − j : 1 ≤ j < i, |π(i) − π(j)| = 1}, with t_i := i − 1 if no such j exists,
- d_i := 1 + #{ k < i : min(π(i−1),π(i)) < π(k) < max(π(i−1),π(i)) },
- r_i := min{ d_i + t_i, i }.
Define Reg_log(π) := ∑_{i=2}^n log(1 + r_i). Note that for all i ≥ 2, d_i ≥ 1 and t_i ≥ 1, hence r_i ≥ 2 and Reg_log(π) ≥ (n − 1)·log 3.

We write MST_log(π) for the L∞ case (||·|| = ||·||_∞). All constants below depend only on the norm and the log base.


Theorem 1 (One-sided domination in L∞). For all π,

MST_log(π) ≤ Reg_log(π).

Proof.
Let G(t) be the threshold graph on P_π joining pairs at L∞-distance ≤ t, with κ_G(t) components. By the layer-cake identity and Kruskal’s algorithm,

MST_log(π) = ∫_0^∞ (κ_G(t) − 1) dt/(1 + t),

where the identity holds for Lebesgue-a.e. t (ties occur on a null set and do not affect the integral).

Define a sparse subgraph H(t) ⊆ G(t) as follows. For each i ≥ 2 add:
(i) the time edge (i−1,i) if Δ_i ≤ t; and
(ii) if there exists j<i with |π(i)−π(j)|=1, let s_i := i − j (the temporal distance to the most recent earlier true value-neighbor) and add the edge (j,i) whenever s_i ≤ t. If no such j exists, no value-neighbor edge is added for any t.

Clearly when an edge is added its L∞-length is ≤ t (time edge: ||p_i−p_{i−1}||_∞ = max{1,Δ_i} ≤ t since Δ_i ≤ t implies t ≥ 1; value edge: ||p_i−p_j||_∞ = max{1,s_i} ≤ t since s_i ≤ t implies t ≥ 1). Hence H(t) ⊆ G(t), so κ_G(t) ≤ κ_H(t).

Expose vertices in increasing i and let κ_i(t) be the number of components in H(t) induced by {1,…,i}. We have κ_1(t)=1. For i≥2, if at least one of the two candidate edges is present, p_i attaches to prior vertices and κ_i(t) ≤ κ_{i−1}(t); if both are absent (i.e., Δ_i > t and either no value neighbor exists or s_i > t), then p_i starts a new component and κ_i(t) = κ_{i−1}(t)+1. Therefore

κ_H(t) ≤ 1 + |{ i ∈ {2,…,n} : Δ_i > t and (no value neighbor exists or s_i > t) }|.

Integrating,

MST_log(π) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n ∫_0^∞ 1{t < min(Δ_i, s_i)} dt/(1+t) = ∑_{i=2}^n log(1 + min{Δ_i, s_i}),

where by convention s_i = +∞ if no earlier true neighbor exists. Finally, for each i,
- if a value neighbor exists, then min{Δ_i, s_i} ≤ min{Δ_i, t_i} ≤ r_i, since d_i ≤ Δ_i and r_i = min(d_i + t_i, i) ≥ min(Δ_i + t_i, t_i) ≥ min(Δ_i, t_i);
- if none exists, then s_i = +∞ and min{Δ_i, s_i} = Δ_i ≤ i = r_i (since t_i = i − 1 and thus r_i = min(d_i + (i − 1), i) = i).
Thus log(1 + min{Δ_i, s_i}) ≤ log(1 + r_i) for all i, and summing yields MST_log(π) ≤ Reg_log(π). ∎


Corollary 2 (Domination for any norm; explicit constant). Let ||·|| be any norm on R^2 and set b := sup_{||z||_∞=1} ||z|| ∈ [1,∞). Then for all π,

MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ (1 + (log b)/log 3) · Reg_log(π).

Proof.
For any edge e, 1 + ||e|| ≤ b(1 + ||e||_∞), hence log(1 + ||e||) ≤ log b + log(1 + ||e||_∞). Summing over an L∞-MST gives MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ (n−1)·log b + MST_log(π). Apply Theorem 1 and Reg_log(π) ≥ (n−1)·log 3 to absorb the additive term. For L_p in R^2 one has b = 2^{1/p}, giving MST_log^{(p)}(π) ≤ (1 + (log 2)/(p·log 3)) · Reg_log(π). ∎


Theorem 3 (Universal logarithmic reverse bound). For any fixed norm ||·|| there exists c>0 such that for all π and n,

Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/c) · MST_log^{||·||}(π).

Proof.
By norm equivalence, there exists α>0 with ||z|| ≥ α||z||_∞ for all z. Any two distinct permutation points satisfy ||·||_∞ ≥ 1, hence every MST edge has norm ≥ α and weight ≥ c := log(1 + α). Therefore MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≥ (n − 1)·c. On the other hand r_i ≤ i yields Reg_log(π) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n log(1 + i) ≤ (n − 1)·log(1 + n). Divide to conclude. For concrete norms: L∞ gives c = log 2; L2 gives c = log(1 + √2); L1 gives c = log 3. ∎


Theorem 4 (Separation; no constant-factor reverse domination). There is no universal C with Reg_log(π) ≤ C·MST_log^{||·||}(π) for all π. In fact, for any fixed norm, there exist permutations with Reg_log/MST_log = Θ(log n).

Proof.
For even n, define π by interleaving the lower and upper halves: π(2m−1)=m and π(2m)=n/2+m for m=1,…,n/2.

- MST_log^{||·||}(π) = Θ(n): Consider the spanning tree connecting the odd-indexed vertices in order and the even-indexed vertices in order, plus one bridge between the two chains. Each intra-chain edge has difference (Δx,Δy)=(2,1), hence constant ||·||-length and constant log-weight; the bridge contributes O(log n). A matching Ω(n) lower bound holds since every MST has n−1 edges each of weight ≥ c>0 (Theorem 3).

- Reg_log(π) = Θ(n log n): For i=2m−1≥3, t_{2m−1}=2 (neighbor m−1 at index 2m−3) and d_{2m−1}=m−1, so r_{2m−1}=m+1. For i=2m≥2, t_{2m}=2 (neighbor n/2+m−1 at index 2m−2) and d_{2m}=m, so r_{2m}=m+2. Therefore

Reg_log(π) = ∑_{m=1}^{n/2} [log(2+m) + log(3+m)] = Θ(n log n).

Hence Reg_log/MST_log = Θ(log n). ∎


Conclusions.
- Reg dominates MST: in L∞, MST_log(π) ≤ Reg_log(π); for any fixed norm, MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ (1 + (log b)/log 3)·Reg_log(π) with b = sup_{||z||_∞=1} ||z||.
- MST does not dominate Reg by a constant: there are permutations with Reg_log/MST_log = Θ(log n).
- Universal reverse bound: for all π, Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/c)·MST_log^{||·||}(π), with explicit c depending only on the norm.
Thus the worst-case multiplicative gap between Reg_log and MST_log is Θ(log n), and this is optimal up to constants.

# Asymptotic comparison between MST_log and Reg_log

Fix a logarithm base (changing it rescales all values by a constant). For π∈S_n define
P_π = { p_i = (i, π(i)) : i=1,…,n } ⊂ R^2.
Fix a norm ∥·∥ on R^2. For distinct u,v∈P_π set w(u,v)=log(1+∥u−v∥). Let MST_log^{∥·∥}(π) be the total w-weight of a minimum spanning tree on P_π.

For i≥2 set
- Δ_i := |π(i)−π(i−1)|,
- t_i := min{ i−j : 1≤j<i and |π(i)−π(j)|=1 }, with t_i := i−1 if the set is empty,
- d_i := 1 + #{ k<i : min(π(i−1),π(i)) < π(k) < max(π(i−1),π(i)) },
- r_i := min{ d_i + t_i, i }.
Define Reg_log(π) := ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+r_i).

We resolve the three questions by establishing: (i) MST_log ≤ C·Reg_log with an explicit C depending only on the norm (C=1 for L∞); (ii) no reverse constant holds; (iii) nevertheless Reg_log ≤ O(log n)·MST_log with explicit constants, and this is tight.


Threshold graphs. For a metric space (X,d) and t≥0, define G(t) on X with edges {u,v} whenever d(u,v) ≤ t. Let κ(t) be the number of connected components of G(t).

Lemma 1 (Kruskal integral identity). Let X be finite, d a metric, and T an MST of the complete graph on X with edge weights log(1+d). If the MST edge-lengths are ℓ_1≤⋯≤ℓ_{|X|−1}, then
∑_{e∈T} log(1+ℓ_e) = ∫_0^∞ (κ(t)−1) dt/(1+t),
where κ(t) is the component count of G(t).

Proof. log(1+ℓ_j)=∫_0^{ℓ_j} dt/(1+t). Summing and exchanging sum/integral gives ∫_0^∞ m(t) dt/(1+t), where m(t)=|{j: ℓ_j≥t}|. By Kruskal’s algorithm, after inserting edges of length ≤t the forest has κ(t) components, hence exactly κ(t)−1 MST edges have length >t, i.e., m(t)=κ(t)−1 for all t except finitely many tie thresholds (measure-zero). ∎


Theorem 1 (Exact one-sided domination in L∞). For all π,
MST_log^{∞}(π) ≤ Reg_log(π).

Proof. Apply Lemma 1 with X=P_π and d=∥·∥_∞. For t≥0 construct H(t)⊆G(t) as follows. Process i=1,…,n; when adding p_i: if Δ_i ≤ t, add {p_{i−1},p_i}; if there exists j<i with |π(i)−π(j)|=1 and t_i=i−j ≤ t, add {p_j,p_i}. These edges have L∞-lengths Δ_i and t_i respectively (since Δ_i, t_i≥1), hence belong to G(t). Expose vertices in increasing i. Adding p_i increases κ_H by 1; if at least one of the two edges is present, p_i attaches to earlier vertices and κ_H decreases by ≥1 (possibly by 2 if both edges connect to distinct components). Thus κ_H fails to return to its previous value only when both Δ_i>t and t_i>t. Therefore
κ(t) ≤ κ_H(t) ≤ 1 + |{ i∈{2,…,n} : Δ_i>t and t_i>t }|.
By Lemma 1,
MST_log^{∞}(π) ≤ ∫_0^∞ ∑_{i=2}^n 1[Δ_i>t and t_i>t] dt/(1+t) = ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+min{Δ_i,t_i}).
Since r_i=min{d_i+t_i,i} and d_i≥1, t_i≤i−1, we have r_i≥t_i, hence log(1+min{Δ_i,t_i}) ≤ log(1+t_i) ≤ log(1+r_i). Summing over i gives MST_log^{∞}(π) ≤ Reg_log(π). ∎

Corollary 2 (Domination for any norm). Let ∥·∥ be any norm on R^2 and b:=sup_{∥z∥_∞=1} ∥z∥ ∈ [1,∞). Then for all π,
MST_log^{∥·∥}(π) ≤ (1 + (log b)/log 3) · Reg_log(π).

Proof. Let T_∞ be an L∞-MST. For any edge e, 1+∥e∥ ≤ b(1+∥e∥_∞), so log(1+∥e∥) ≤ log b + log(1+∥e∥_∞). Summing over e∈T_∞ and using Theorem 1 yields MST_log^{∥·∥}(π) ≤ (n−1)·log b + Reg_log(π). Since for i≥2, r_i≥2, we have Reg_log(π) ≥ (n−1)·log 3; absorb the additive term. For L_p in R^2, b=2^{1/p}, giving MST_log^{(p)}(π) ≤ (1 + (log 2)/(p·log 3))·Reg_log(π). ∎


Theorem 3 (Universal logarithmic reverse bound). For any norm ∥·∥ on R^2 there exists c>0 (depending only on the norm) such that for all n and π,
Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/c) · MST_log^{∥·∥}(π).

Proof. Any two distinct permutation points differ by ≥1 in each coordinate; thus each spanning-tree edge e satisfies ∥e∥_∞≥1. Let α:=inf{∥z∥ : ∥z∥_∞=1}>0 and set c:=log(1+α). Then ∥e∥ ≥ α (by homogeneity) and w(e)≥c, so MST_log^{∥·∥}(π) ≥ (n−1)·c. Also r_i≤i implies Reg_log(π) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+i) ≤ (n−1)·log(1+n). Divide. For L∞, L2, L1 one may take α=1, √2, 2 respectively, hence c=log 2, log(1+√2), log 3. ∎


Theorem 4 (Separation; no reverse constant). Fix any norm ∥·∥. There is no universal C such that Reg_log(π) ≤ C·MST_log^{∥·∥}(π) for all π and n. In fact, there exist permutations with Reg_log(π)/MST_log^{∥·∥}(π) = Θ(log n).

Proof. For m≥2, define π^{(m)}_n by listing values by residue classes mod m, in increasing residue order and increasing within each class:
π^{(m)}_n = (1,1+m,1+2m,…; 2,2+m,2+2m,…; …; m,2m,3m, …), truncated at n.
Let m_r be the size of residue class r (so m_r≈n/m and ∑_r m_r=n). In L∞, connect consecutive indices within each class by time edges (length m, weight log(1+m)), totaling (n−m)·log(1+m). Connect the m class-blocks by m−1 boundary time edges (each O(log n)), totaling O(m log n). Thus MST_log^{∞}(π^{(m)}_n) ≤ (n−m)·log(1+m)+O(m log n)=Θ(n+m log n). By norm equivalence and the per-edge lower bound (Theorem 3), MST_log^{∥·∥}(π^{(m)}_n)=Θ(n+m log n).
For Reg_log, fix r≥2. For the k-th element v=r+km of class r, its most recent earlier true neighbor is v−1=r−1+km (if v−1≤n), appearing exactly m_{r−1} steps earlier; otherwise no earlier neighbor exists and t_i≥m_{r−1}. In all cases t_i≥m_{r−1}, hence r_i≥t_i and log(1+r_i)≥log(1+m_{r−1}). Summing yields
Reg_log(π^{(m)}_n) ≥ ∑_{r=2}^m m_r·log(1+m_{r−1}) = Θ(n log(n/m)).
For fixed m, Reg_log(π^{(m)}_n)=Θ(n log n) while MST_log^{∥·∥}(π^{(m)}_n)=Θ(n), hence Reg_log/MST_log=Θ(log n). ∎


Conclusion. For any fixed norm on R^2 and all permutations π:
- Reg dominates MST: MST_log^{∞}(π) ≤ Reg_log(π), and more generally MST_log^{∥·∥}(π) ≤ (1 + (log b)/log 3)·Reg_log(π) with b:=sup_{∥z∥_∞=1} ∥z∥.
- No reverse constant holds: there exist permutations with Reg_log(π)/MST_log^{∥·∥}(π) = Θ(log n).
- Universal upper bound: Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/c)·MST_log^{∥·∥}(π), with c>0 depending only on the norm (e.g., c=log 2 for L∞, c=log(1+√2) for L2, c=log 3 for L1).
Thus the worst-case multiplicative gap is Θ(log n), and this is optimal up to constant factors. All constants depend only on the norm and the chosen logarithm base.

Asymptotic comparison between MST_log and Reg_log

Setup and definitions
- Fix n≥2 and a permutation π∈S_n. Represent π by P_π={p_i=(i,π(i)) : i=1,…,n}⊂R^2.
- Fix a norm ||·|| on R^2 and a logarithm base (changing either rescales quantities by fixed constants). For u,v∈P_π set w(u,v)=log(1+||u−v||).
- Let MST_log^{||·||}(π) be the total w-weight of a minimum spanning tree (MST) on P_π. For ||·||=||·||_∞ (L∞) write MST_log(π).
- For i≥2 define
  Δ_i:=|π(i)−π(i−1)|,
  t_i:=min{i−j : 1≤j<i and |π(i)−π(j)|=1} (and t_i:=i−1 if no such j exists),
  d_i:=1+# { k<i : min(π(i−1),π(i)) < π(k) < max(π(i−1),π(i)) },
  r_i:=min{ d_i+t_i, i }.
Set Reg_log(π):=∑_{i=2}^n log(1+r_i). Note: for i≥2, d_i≥1 and t_i≥1, hence r_i≥2 and log(1+r_i)≥log 3.

Theorem 1 (Exact one-sided domination in L∞)
For every permutation π, MST_log(π) ≤ Reg_log(π).

Proof.
For t≥0, let G(t) be the graph on P_π with an edge {u,v} whenever ||u−v||_∞ ≤ t, and let κ(t) be its number of connected components. If the L∞-lengths of the MST edges are {ℓ_e}, then the Kruskal integral identity gives
MST_log(π) = ∑_e log(1+ℓ_e) = ∫_0^∞ #(e: ℓ_e>t) dt/(1+t) = ∫_0^∞ (κ(t)−1) dt/(1+t),
where the last equality holds except on a measure-zero set of tie thresholds.
We upper bound κ(t) via a sparse subgraph H(t). For each i=2,…,n define at most one “parent” par_t(i) by
- par_t(i)=i−1 if Δ_i ≤ t,
- else par_t(i)=j, where j<i is the largest index with |π(i)−π(j)|=1 and i−j≤t (i.e., t_i≤t),
- else par_t(i) undefined.
Whenever par_t(i) is defined, the L∞-length of (p_i,p_{par_t(i)}) is max{1,Δ_i} or max{1,t_i}, hence ≤ t. Let F(t) be the directed graph with edges (i,par_t(i)) and let H(t) be its underlying undirected graph. Then H(t)⊆G(t), so κ(t) ≤ κ_H(t). Further, F(t) is acyclic (edges go from i to a smaller index), and its number of components equals the number of roots, namely
κ_H(t) = 1 + |{ i∈{2,…,n} : par_t(i) is undefined }| = 1 + |{ i≥2 : Δ_i>t and t_i>t }|.
Therefore κ(t) ≤ 1 + |{ i≥2 : Δ_i>t and t_i>t }|. Integrating,
MST_log(π) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n ∫_0^∞ 1[Δ_i>t and t_i>t] dt/(1+t) = ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+min{Δ_i,t_i}).
Since r_i≥t_i, we have log(1+min{Δ_i,t_i}) ≤ log(1+t_i) ≤ log(1+r_i). Summing over i proves MST_log(π) ≤ Reg_log(π).
∎

Theorem 2 (Domination in any fixed norm)
Let ||·|| be any norm on R^2, and let b:=sup_{||z||_∞=1} ||z|| ∈ [1,∞). Then for all π,
MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ [1 + (log b)/log 3] · Reg_log(π).

Proof.
Let T_∞ be an L∞-MST. For any edge e, ||e|| ≤ b||e||_∞, hence 1+||e|| ≤ b(1+||e||_∞) and log(1+||e||) ≤ log b + log(1+||e||_∞). Summing over the n−1 edges of T_∞,
MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ (n−1)·log b + MST_log(π) ≤ (n−1)·log b + Reg_log(π).
Since Reg_log(π) ≥ (n−1)·log 3, the additive term is absorbed, yielding MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ [1 + (log b)/log 3] · Reg_log(π). For L_p in R^2, b=2^{1/p}.
∎

Theorem 3 (Universal logarithmic reverse bound)
For any fixed norm ||·|| there exists c>0, depending only on ||·|| and the log base, such that for all π and n,
Reg_log(π) ≤ [log(1+n)/c] · MST_log^{||·||}(π).
In particular, one may take c=log 2 for L∞, c=log(1+√2) for L2, and c=log 3 for L1.

Proof.
In a permutation grid, for any distinct i≠j we have |i−j|≥1 and |π(i)−π(j)|≥1; thus every L∞-edge length is ≥1, every L2-edge length ≥√2, and every L1-edge length ≥2. Therefore each MST edge has weight at least c:=log(1+α), with α=1,√2,2 in L∞, L2, L1 respectively. Hence MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≥ (n−1)·c. On the other hand r_i≤i implies Reg_log(π) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+i) ≤ (n−1)·log(1+n). Combining, Reg_log(π) ≤ [log(1+n)/c] · MST_log^{||·||}(π).
∎

Theorem 4 (Separation; tightness of the Θ(log n) gap)
There exists a family of permutations {π_n} such that for every fixed norm ||·||,
Reg_log(π_n) / MST_log^{||·||}(π_n) = Θ(log n).
In particular, there is no universal constant C with Reg_log(π) ≤ C·MST_log^{||·||}(π) for all π.

Proof.
Let n=2m and define π by listing all odd values then all even values:
π(i)=2i−1 for 1≤i≤m, and π(m+j)=2j for 1≤j≤m.
MST cost. In L∞, connect consecutive indices within each block and add one bridge between the blocks. Within a block, ||p_{i+1}−p_i||_∞=max{1,2}=2, so each such edge has weight log 3; the bridge between p_m and p_{m+1} has L∞-length 2m−3 and weight log(2m−2)=Θ(log n). Thus MST_log(π) ≤ (n−2)·log 3 + Θ(log n) = Θ(n). A matching Ω(n) lower bound holds since every MST has n−1 edges and each has weight ≥log 2; hence MST_log(π)=Θ(n). The same spanning-tree pattern shows MST_log^{||·||}(π)=Θ(n) for L1 and L2 (constant intra-block edge lengths and one bridge of length Θ(n)).
Reg cost. For 2≤i≤m (odd block), no earlier value-neighbor exists: t_i=i−1 and d_i=1, hence r_i=i and ∑_{i=2}^m log(1+r_i)=Θ(m log m). For i=m+j (even block), 1≤j≤m, both neighbors 2j−1 (index j) and, if j<m, 2j+1 (index j+1) appear earlier; the most recent is at index j+1 for j<m and j for j=m. Thus t_i=m−1 for j<m and t_i=m for j=m. Further, d_i=m−1 for j=1 and d_i=2 for 2≤j≤m. Therefore r_i=m+1 for j<m and r_{2m}=m+2, so each even-block index contributes Θ(log m). Summing, the even block contributes Θ(m log m). Hence Reg_log(π)=Θ(m log m + m log m)=Θ(n log n).
Consequently Reg_log(π)/MST_log^{||·||}(π)=Θ(log n) for any fixed norm.
∎

Consequences
- Reg dominates MST: in L∞, MST_log(π) ≤ Reg_log(π) for all π (Theorem 1); for any norm ||·||, MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ [1 + (log b)/log 3]·Reg_log(π), with b=sup_{||z||_∞=1} ||z|| (Theorem 2).
- No constant reverse domination: there is no universal C with Reg_log(π) ≤ C·MST_log^{||·||}(π) for all π; the worst-case gap is Θ(log n) (Theorem 4). Nevertheless, universally Reg_log(π) ≤ [log(1+n)/c]·MST_log^{||·||}(π) with explicit c>0 depending only on the norm (Theorem 3).
Thus the asymptotic comparison between MST_log and Reg_log is resolved up to an optimal Θ(log n) factor in the worst case. All constants depend only on the norm and the chosen logarithm base.

Asymptotic comparison between MST_log and Reg_log

Setup. Fix n≥2 and a permutation π∈S_n. Let P_π={p_i=(i,π(i)) : i=1,…,n}⊂R^2. Fix a norm ||·|| on R^2 and a logarithm base; changing either only rescales constants. For u,v∈P_π define the edge weight w(u,v)=log(1+||u−v||). Let MST_log^{||·||}(π) be the total w-weight of a minimum spanning tree on P_π.

For i≥2 define
- Δ_i := |π(i)−π(i−1)|,
- t_i := min{i−j : 1≤j<i and |π(i)−π(j)|=1}, with t_i := i−1 if no such j exists,
- d_i := 1 + #{ k<i : min(π(i−1),π(i)) < π(k) < max(π(i−1),π(i)) },
- r_i := min{ d_i + t_i, i }.
Set Reg_log(π) := ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+r_i). Note that d_i≥1 and t_i≥1 (or t_i=i−1), hence r_i≥2 and Reg_log(π) ≥ (n−1)·log 3.

We resolve the three questions by proving: (i) MST_log ≤ C·Reg_log for a universal C (C=1 for L∞); (ii) a universal reverse bound Reg_log ≤ O(log n)·MST_log; (iii) tightness via a family with Reg_log/MST_log=Θ(log n).

Theorem 1 (Exact one-sided domination in L∞). For the L∞ norm,
  MST_log^∞(π) ≤ Reg_log(π) for all π.

Proof. For t≥0, let G(t) be the graph on P_π with an edge {u,v} iff ||u−v||_∞ ≤ t, and let κ(t) be its number of connected components. For an MST with L∞-edge lengths {ℓ_e}, Kruskal’s algorithm yields the identity
  MST_log^∞(π) = ∑_e log(1+ℓ_e) = ∫_0^∞ (κ(t)−1) d log(1+t).
Indeed, for each t, the number of MST edges with length > t equals κ(t)−1 (edges with length ≤ t connect each component of G(t) into a tree), and ∫_0^{ℓ} d log(1+t) = log(1+ℓ).
Construct a sparse subgraph H(t) as follows. Process i=2,…,n; add to H(t):
- the time edge (i−1,i) if Δ_i ≤ t (then ||p_i−p_{i−1}||_∞ = max{1,Δ_i} ≤ t), and
- the value-neighbor edge (i,j), where j<i is the largest index with |π(i)−π(j)|=1, if t_i ≤ t (then ||p_i−p_j||_∞ = max{1,t_i} ≤ t).
Thus H(t)⊆G(t), so κ(t)≤κ_H(t). Expose vertices in increasing i and let κ_H,i(t) be the component count induced by {1,…,i}. When i arrives, the count increases by 1; if at least one of the two edges is present, i attaches to a previous component, reducing the count by 1; if both are present and connect to two distinct components, it reduces by 2, which only decreases κ further. Therefore
  κ_H,i(t) ≤ κ_H,i−1(t) + 1[Δ_i>t and t_i>t].
By induction, κ_H(t) ≤ 1 + |{ i∈{2,…,n} : Δ_i>t and t_i>t }|. Integrating,
  MST_log^∞(π) ≤ ∫_0^∞ |{i : Δ_i>t, t_i>t}| d log(1+t)
                 = ∑_{i=2}^n ∫_0^{min{Δ_i,t_i}} d log(1+t)
                 = ∑_{i=2}^n log(1 + min{Δ_i,t_i})
                 ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n log(1 + r_i) = Reg_log(π),
using r_i ≥ t_i. ∎

Corollary 2 (Domination for any norm; explicit constant). Let b:=sup_{||z||_∞=1} ||z|| ∈ [1,∞). Then for all π,
  MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ (1 + (log b)/log 3) · Reg_log(π).

Proof. Let T∞ be an L∞-MST. For any edge e, 1+||e|| ≤ b(1+||e||_∞), hence log(1+||e||) ≤ log b + log(1+||e||_∞). Summing over the n−1 edges of T∞ yields
  MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ (n−1)·log b + MST_log^∞(π) ≤ (n−1)·log b + Reg_log(π).
Since Reg_log(π) ≥ (n−1)·log 3, the additive term is absorbed, yielding the stated factor. For L_p in R^2, b=2^{1/p}, giving MST_log^{(p)}(π) ≤ (1 + (log 2)/(p·log 3))·Reg_log(π). ∎

Theorem 3 (Universal logarithmic reverse bound). For any fixed norm ||·|| there exists c>0 such that for all π and n,
  Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/c) · MST_log^{||·||}(π).

Proof. In a permutation grid, any two distinct points have both coordinate gaps ≥1. Thus every spanning-tree edge has length at least α and weight at least c:=log(1+α), where (α,c) equals (1,log 2) in L∞, (√2, log(1+√2)) in L2, and (2, log 3) in L1. More generally, by norm equivalence there is α>0 with ||z|| ≥ α||z||_∞, giving the same conclusion with c=log(1+α). Hence MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≥ (n−1)·c. Also r_i≤i implies Reg_log(π) ≤ ∑_{i=2}^n log(1+i) ≤ (n−1)·log(1+n). Combining yields the claim. ∎

Theorem 4 (Separation; no reverse constant). There is no universal C with Reg_log(π) ≤ C·MST_log^{||·||}(π) for all π. In fact, for any fixed norm there exist permutations with Reg_log/MST_log = Θ(log n).

Proof. For even n, take the parity-block permutation: list all even values in increasing order, then all odd values in increasing order; i.e., π(i)=2i for 1≤i≤n/2 and π(i)=2(i−n/2)−1 for i>n/2.
MST_log^{||·||}(π)=Θ(n): within each half, the time edges (i−1,i) have Δ_i=2, hence constant weight; these n−2 edges contribute Θ(n). One bridge connects the halves, costing O(log n). A matching Ω(n) lower bound holds since every MST has n−1 edges of weight ≥c>0 (Theorem 3). Thus MST_log=Θ(n).
Reg_log(π)=Θ(n log n): in the first half (even block), no odd has appeared, so for 2≤i≤n/2 one has t_i=i−1 and d_i=1; hence r_i=i and ∑_{i=2}^{n/2} log(1+r_i)=Θ((n/2)·log n). In the second half (odd block), the nearest value-neighbor lies in the first half at temporal distance t_i=n/2 for all but the first odd, and d_i=2 (the unique even between consecutive odds has appeared), hence r_i=Θ(n) for almost all i, contributing Θ(log n) each; the first odd has r_i=Θ(n) as well. Thus the odd block contributes Θ((n/2)·log n). Summing gives Reg_log(π)=Θ(n log n). Therefore Reg_log/MST_log=Θ(log n). ∎

Consequences. Theorems 1–4 resolve the dominance questions:
- Reg dominates MST: MST_log^∞(π) ≤ Reg_log(π) for all π; for any fixed norm, MST_log^{||·||}(π) ≤ (1 + (log b)/log 3)·Reg_log(π).
- MST does not dominate Reg by a constant: there are permutations with Reg_log/MST_log = Θ(log n).
- Universal upper bound: for all π, Reg_log(π) ≤ (log(1+n)/c)·MST_log^{||·||}(π).
Hence the worst-case multiplicative gap is Θ(log n) and this is optimal. Constants depend only on the norm and the logarithm base.
