{"feedback_md":"The question is now resolved with publication-ready statements in output.md. The L∞ domination MST_log ≤ Reg_log is proven via the Kruskal integral identity specialized to φ(x)=log(1+x), together with a sparse threshold subgraph H(t) that adds only two local edges per step: the time edge when Δ_i≤t and the “most recent value-neighbor” edge when t_i≤t. Exposing vertices in increasing i, the component count can increase only when both edges are absent (Δ_i>t and t_i>t). Integrating over t yields MST_log(L∞) ≤ ∑_i log(1+min{Δ_i,t_i}) ≤ ∑_i log(1+r_i)=Reg_log, since r_i≥t_i. Ties at threshold values occur on a measure-zero set and do not affect the integral; this is noted. The norm-lifting is sharpened correctly via 1+||e|| ≤ b(1+||e||∞), giving MST_log^N ≤ (n−1)log b + MST_log(L∞) ≤ (1+(log b)/log 3)·Reg_log since Reg_log ≥ (n−1)log 3. For L_p in R^2, this yields C_p = 1 + (log 2)/(p·log 3).\n\nThe reverse inequality fails: parity/mod-m families produce MST_log = Θ(n) (constant-cost intra-block edges plus O(log n) bridges) while Reg_log = Θ(n log(n/m)), so Reg/MST = Θ(log n) for constant m. The universal reverse bound Reg_log ≤ (log(1+n)/c_N)·MST_log^N is established using a uniform per-edge lower bound on permutation grids (L∞: log 2; L2: log(1+√2); L1: log 3), proving the Θ(log n) worst-case gap is optimal in order.\n\nAll definitions are precise, the component-count inequality is justified, norm and base dependencies are clean, and examples are consistent. Suggested next steps: (i) add the concave-weight extension MST_φ^∞ ≤ ∑ φ(min{Δ_i,t_i}) to proofs.md (it follows from the same integral method); (ii) quantify leading constants in E[MST_log] and E[Reg_log] for random π; (iii) explore instance-sensitive improvements beyond Θ(log n) worst-case (e.g., dependence on the number of residue classes).","summary_md":"We finalized a rigorous, self-contained resolution: (1) In L∞, MST_log ≤ Reg_log via Kruskal’s integral and a sparse H(t). (2) For any norm, MST_log^N ≤ (1+(log b_N)/log 3)·Reg_log. (3) No constant reverse bound: parity/mod-m families yield Reg/MST = Θ(log n). (4) Universal reverse bound Reg ≤ (log(1+n)/c_N)·MST_log^N.
