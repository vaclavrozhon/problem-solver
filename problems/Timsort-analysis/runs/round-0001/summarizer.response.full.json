I want to keep it concise while crafting the final JSON to ensure that the summary remains within 120-160 words. \n\nThe round summary indicates the complexity of TimSort, highlighting that it can incur more comparisons than expected.",

For Python\u2019s patched TimSort (with the extra case #5) we established: (i) a coarse bound comparisons = O(n + n\u00b7H) via a starting/ending-sequence decomposition and a token amortization; (ii) a sharp bound comparisons \u2264 (3/2)\u00b7n\u00b7H + O(n) using potential \u03a6(r) = (3/2) r log2 r and grouping merges so each group\u2019s cost \u2264 \u0394\u03a6, with O(n) total slack. Key assumptions: Python-corrected TimSort (case #5), galloping only reduces comparisons, converting merge-cost to comparisons costs O(n).
