Last round: the claim “TimSort ≤ n·H + O(n) comparisons” is false (Buss–Knop examples show ≥ (3/2)·n·H − O(n)). For Python’s patched TimSort (with the extra case #5) we established: (i) a coarse bound comparisons = O(n + n·H) via a starting/ending-sequence decomposition and a token amortization; (ii) a sharp bound comparisons ≤ (3/2)·n·H + O(n) using potential Φ(r) = (3/2) r log2 r and grouping merges so each group’s cost ≤ ΔΦ, with O(n) total slack. Key assumptions: Python-corrected TimSort (case #5), galloping only reduces comparisons, converting merge-cost to comparisons costs O(n). Next steps: write up rigorous proofs and update the main statement to the 3/2 factor. Citations: papers/paper1.txt (Auger et al.), papers/paper2.txt (Munro & Wild).
