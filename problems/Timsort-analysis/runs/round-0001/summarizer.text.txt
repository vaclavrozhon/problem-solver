{"summary_md":"Round summary: The claim that TimSort always uses ≤ n·H + O(n) comparisons (leading constant 1) is false: Buss–Knop give input families with ≥ (3/2−o(1))·n·log2 n comparisons when H ≈ log2 n. However, Python TimSort with the de Gouw fix (extra guard r2+r3 ≥ r4) is proved to use at most C·n + C'·n·H comparisons, i.e., O(n + nH). A self-contained proof is given: model the core stack rules; establish a Fibonacci-type (exponential) growth invariant; decompose each push into a starting sequence (maximal #2 merges) and an ending sequence; show starting sequences cost O(n) via geometric bounds; account ending-sequence costs with a token scheme (each element gets 2 c-tokens + 1 s-token on push/height drop) and prove no deficits; bound post-starting-sequence stack height by h ≤ 4 + 2 log2(n/r) so each element pays O(1+log(n/r)) tokens, summing to O(n + nH). A potential-function refinement yields a tight upper bound (3/2)·n·H + O(n). Lower bound: any comparison sort needs ≥ nH − O(n) comparisons (Stirling).","one_line_summary":"Python TimSort (with fix) uses O(n + nH) comparisons; TimSort cannot always attain nH+O(n).","highlights":["Leading-constant-1 bound is false for TimSort: Buss–Knop exhibit inputs forcing ≥(3/2−o(1))·n·log2 n (H≈log n).","Python TimSort with the de Gouw fix (guard r2+r3 ≥ r4) satisfies comparisons ≤ C·n + C'·n·H (i.e., O(n + nH)).","Proof skeleton: model TimSort rules; prove Fibonacci-type invariant ⇒ exponential stack growth.","Starting sequences (maximal #2 runs after a push) incur total cost O(n) via geometric-series bounds.","Ending sequences covered by token accounting: each element gets 2 c-tokens + 1 s-token on push/height-drop; charges per merge consume these tokens; no deficits.","Stack-height after a run’s starting sequence: h ≤ 4 + 2·log2(n/r), so each element supplies O(1+log(n/r)) tokens; summing yields O(n + nH).","Refinement: potential-function analysis proves a tight upper bound (3/2)·n·H + O(n); information-theoretic lower bound is nH − O(n)."],"next_questions":["Polish constants and edge cases (empty/singleton runs, final-collapse folding) and update the formal write-up.","Formalize the potential-function proof to present the tight (3/2)·n·H + O(n) bound in full detail.","If a leading constant 1 is required, switch to/describe nearly-optimal stable mergesorts (e.g., peeksort/powersort) that achieve nH + O(n) and add their proofs." ]}
