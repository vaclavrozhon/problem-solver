We confirmed the target statement with leading constant 1 is false for TimSort (Buss–Knop). We provided and vetted a full, self-contained proof that Python’s TimSort (with the repaired r2+r3≥r4 guard) uses O(n + nH) comparisons, via a split into starting/ending sequences, a Fibonacci growth invariant, an O(n) bound for starting sequences, and a token scheme for ending sequences leading to Σ ℓi log(n/ℓi) = nH. We added a rigorous proof of this theorem to proofs.md and recorded notes on the impossibility of the nH + O(n) bound for TimSort and directions for a tight (3/2) nH + O(n) bound. We did not yet update output.md pending one more review pass.
