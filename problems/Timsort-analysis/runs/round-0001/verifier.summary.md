The claim with leading constant 1 is false for TimSort. Correct bounds are: (i) comparisons = O(n + nH) via starting/ending sequence decomposition and token accounting; (ii) sharp upper bound (3/2)·nH + O(n) via a potential function, with matching lower bound. We will update proofs.md with rigorous versions and output.md with the corrected main theorem. P1/P2/P5 must remove the constant-1 claim; P3/P4 provide the correct target and approach.
