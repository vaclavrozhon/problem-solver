Last round: The claim that TimSort always uses ≤ n·H + O(n) comparisons (leading constant 1) is false — Buss–Knop give families forcing ≥(3/2−o(1))·n·log n (H≈log n). For Python TimSort with the de Gouw fix (guard r2+r3≥r4) a full, self-contained proof shows comparisons ≤ C·n + C'·n·H, i.e. O(n + nH). Proof outline: model TimSort's core stack rules; prove a Fibonacci-type (exponential) growth invariant; split each push into a starting sequence (maximal #2 merges) and an ending sequence; show starting sequences total O(n) by geometric bounds; handle ending sequences by a token scheme (2 c‑tokens + 1 s‑token per element on push/height-drop) and prove no deficits; bound post-starting stack height h ≤ 4 + 2 log2(n/r) so each element supplies O(1+log(n/r)) tokens; summation yields O(n + nH). A refined potential-function yields the tight upper bound (3/2)·n·H + O(n). Citations: papers/paper1.txt, papers/paper2.txt.
