We corrected the target: TimSort cannot satisfy ≤ n·H + O(n); instead we proved the coarse O(n + nH) bound via starting/ending-sequence analysis, token accounting, and a height bound, and we stated the sharp (3/2)·nH + O(n) bound with standard potential-method lemmas. We will append full proofs for the coarse result and the sharp bound to proofs.md; output.md already reflects the corrected main theorem.
