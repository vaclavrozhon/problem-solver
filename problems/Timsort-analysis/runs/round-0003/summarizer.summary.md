Round summary: The original goal (TimSort ≤ n·H + O(n) comparisons) is false — Buss–Knop show inputs forcing ≥(3/2)·n·H−O(n). For Python’s patched TimSort (with the extra #5 rule) we proved two correct bounds: a coarse adaptivity bound comparisons = O(n + n·H) via a starting/ending-sequence decomposition and a token amortization argument; and a sharp bound comparisons ≤ (3/2)·n·H + O(n) using potential Φ(r)=(3/2) r log2 r plus grouping unbalanced merges so each group’s cost ≤ ΔΦ, with O(n) total slack. Assumptions: Python-corrected TimSort (case #5); galloping only reduces comparisons; converting merge cost to comparisons adds O(n).
