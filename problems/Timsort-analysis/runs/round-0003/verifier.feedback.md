All provers now correctly target the attainable bounds for Python’s patched TimSort: the coarse O(n + nH) and the sharp (3/2)·nH + O(n) (tight). The key ingredients are consistently present: (i) a stack-growth invariant implying r_{i+2} > r_{i+1}+r_i and hence geometric growth along the stack; (ii) decomposition into starting vs. ending sequences; (iii) a geometric bound on the total cost of starting sequences with an explicit constant γ ≈ 16.49; (iv) a token scheme for ending sequences, including c- and s-tokens with nonnegativity, critically using the corrected case #5 to force a follow-up merge after #4/#5; (v) a height bound h ≤ 4 + 2 log2(n/r) after each starting sequence; (vi) conversion from merge cost to comparisons with O(n) overhead. These suffice to conclude comparisons = O(n + nH). For the sharp bound, the outlined potential method with Φ(r) = (3/2)·r·log2 r, the balanced-merge lemma (within factor φ²), the forbidden patterns (no #2#2 and no XX#2), the pairing of unbalanced merges, and the grouping argument are all aligned with AJNP and standard.

Rigor: The statements are accurate; the proofs are largely complete at the level appropriate for proofs.md, though the invariant preservation (case-by-case) and the s-token nonnegativity (explicitly showing the immediate continuation after #4/#5 under the Python patch) should be written out once in full detail or cited precisely to AJNP. For the sharp bound, include the explicit functional inequality in the pairing lemma (concavity of F and the valid domain), and the grouping lemma statement with the O(r) slack per ending sequence. All provers avoid the false constant-1 claim and clearly state reliance on the patched Python variant and that galloping only decreases comparisons.

Next steps: (1) Consolidate a single, self-contained coarse proof in proofs.md (with the explicit γ and the h-bound), referencing AJNP for invariant details; (2) add the full potential-method proof pieces for the 3/2 bound; (3) keep output.md as is; (4) optionally record explicit constants for the O(n) terms and note the sentinel technique for final collapse.
