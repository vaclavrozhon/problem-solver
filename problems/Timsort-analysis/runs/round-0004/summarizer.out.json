  "summary_md": "Summary: The original goal (TimSort \u2264 n\u00b7H + O(n)) is false: Buss\u2013Knop show inputs forcing \u2265(3/2)\u00b7n\u00b7H \u2212 O(n). For Python\u2019s patched TimSort (with added case #5) we proved two correct bounds: (i) coarse adaptivity comparisons = O(n + n\u00b7H) via a starting/ending-sequence decomposition and a token amortization (starting sequences total \u2264 \u03b3\u00b7n with \u03b3 = 6\u221a2+8 \u2248 16.485; ending sequences \u2264 12n + 6nH); (ii) sharp bound comparisons \u2264 (3/2)\u00b7n\u00b7H + O(n) using potential \u03a6(r) = (3/2) r log2 r, balanced-merge and pairing/grouping lemmas. The 3/2 factor is tight. Assumptions: Python-corrected TimSort (case #5); galloping only helps; converting merge-cost to comparisons adds O(n). Citations: papers/paper1.txt, papers/paper2.txt.",

    "The claim comparisons \u2264 n\u00b7H + O(n) is false for TimSort (Buss\u2013Knop counterexamples \u21d2 factor 3/2).",
    "Coarse bound O(n + nH) proved by splitting each push into starting (total O(n)) and ending sequences (token amortization).",
