Summary: The original goal (TimSort ≤ n·H + O(n)) is false: Buss–Knop show inputs forcing ≥(3/2)·n·H − O(n). For Python’s patched TimSort (with added case #5) we proved two correct bounds: (i) coarse adaptivity comparisons = O(n + n·H) via a starting/ending-sequence decomposition and a token amortization (starting sequences total ≤ γ·n with γ = 6√2+8 ≈ 16.485; ending sequences ≤ 12n + 6nH); (ii) sharp bound comparisons ≤ (3/2)·n·H + O(n) using potential Φ(r) = (3/2) r log2 r, balanced-merge and pairing/grouping lemmas. The 3/2 factor is tight. Assumptions: Python-corrected TimSort (case #5); galloping only helps; converting merge-cost to comparisons adds O(n). Citations: papers/paper1.txt, papers/paper2.txt.
