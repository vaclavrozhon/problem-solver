prove that timsort adapts to the entropy of the distribution of run lengths. I.e.,  prove that it never uses more than <math> O(n\mathcal{H} ) </math> comparisons, where <math>\mathcal{H} = \sum_{i=1}^{r} \frac{\ell_i}{n} \log_2\left({\frac n{\ell_i}}\right)</math>, for <math>\ell_1,\ldots,\ell_r</math> the lengths of the runs in the input.


The goal is a fully self-contained proof.
