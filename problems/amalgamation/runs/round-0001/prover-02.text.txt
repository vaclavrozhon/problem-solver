I cannot check prior results; I proceed from the task statement only.\n\nScope and goal\n- We study 4-hypertournaments, i.e., structures (V,R) with a 4-ary relation satisfying injectivity, closure under even permutations, and the “exactly one of (x1,…,x4) and (x2,x1,x3,x4) is in R” condition.\n- For a finite set V, a 4-hypertournament is equivalent to specifying, for each 4-subset S of V, which parity-class of orderings of S lies in R (even vs. odd). Thus, for each 4-set S, we can define an orientation bit f(S) ∈ {+1,−1} that determines all tuples on S.\n- On 5 vertices X, the induced 4-hypertournament type is determined by the 5-tuple of bits p = (p_x)_{x∈X} with p_x := f(X\\{x}). Up to isomorphism (permuting X, with the induced parity corrections on the 4-sets), there are exactly three orbits of such 5-tuples, denoted C_5, O_5, H_5 in the task statement.\n- We are to decide whether the class H of all finite 4-hypertournaments omitting O_5 has the amalgamation property (AP).\n\nKey observations and lemmas\n\nLemma 1 (Orientation function viewpoint).\nFor any finite vertex set V, giving a 4-hypertournament structure on V is equivalent to giving an arbitrary function f: [V]^4 → {±1}. The relation R is then determined by: for a 4-tuple (x1,x2,x3,x4) of distinct vertices, let S={x1,x2,x3,x4}; let π be the permutation that maps the increasing ordering of S (in the ambient enumeration of V) to (x1,x2,x3,x4). Then (x1,x2,x3,x4) ∈ R iff sgn(π) = f(S).\n\nProof sketch. Conditions (1)–(3) say that for each 4-set S, the membership of an ordered tuple from S in R depends only on the parity of the permutation from a fixed ordering of S. Thus for each S we freely choose whether “even” or “odd” permutations lie in R; choices on different S are independent. Conversely, given f, the above prescription defines a 4-hypertournament.∎\n\nConsequences. There are no compatibility constraints between different 4-sets S,T ⊆ V in the definition; all constraints arise only when we forbid an induced O_5 on some 5-set X, i.e., when we constrain the 5-tuple (p_x)_{x∈X} not to fall into the O_5 isomorphism class.\n\nNotation for 5-sets and types.\n- For a 5-element set X⊆V with the ambient enumeration 1<⋯<|V|, define p(X) ∈ {±1}^X by p_x := f(X\\{x}). The induced isomorphism type on X depends only on the orbit of p(X) under the action of S_5 given by p ↦ M(τ)p with (M(τ)p)_i = ε_i(τ)·p_{τ^{-1}(i)}, where ε_i(τ) is the sign of the restriction of τ to the 4-set X\\{τ^{-1}(i)}. The three orbits are denoted C_5, O_5, H_5.\n- Concretely: representatives include p≡(+,+,+,+,+) for C_5, p with exactly one + (and four −) for O_5, and p with + on {1,3,5} and − on {2,4} for H_5 (indices relative to a chosen enumeration of X). Different enumerations (τ) can permute and flip coordinates (via ε(τ)), so the raw count of +’s is not invariant.\n\nReduction to one-point amalgamation\n\nLemma 2 (One-point amalgamation suffices).\nTo decide AP for H, it suffices to decide the following: whenever A∈H and B = A ∪ {b} ∈ H and C = A ∪ {c} ∈ H with B∩C = A, there exists D ∈ H on A∪{b,c} extending both B and C.\n\nProof sketch. Suppose one-point amalgamation always succeeds. Given arbitrary B,C ∈ H over A, enumerate the vertices of C\\A as c1,…,ck. Starting with B0 := B, amalgamate Bi with Ai := A ∪ {c1,…,ci−1} by a one-point amalgamation with Ci := Ai ∪ {ci} to produce Bi+1 on A ∪ (B\\A) ∪ {c1,…,ci}. Each step preserves membership in H (no O_5 arises on any 5-set entirely inside the old structure, and the newly created 5-sets are controlled by the one-point step). After k steps we obtain D∈H containing both B and C over A.∎\n\nThus, from now on we focus on |A|=4, B=A∪{b}, C=A∪{c}.\n\nThe 6-vertex constraint system for one-point amalgamation\nLet A={1,2,3,4}, b=5, c=6. Structures on B and C fix f on all 4-sets contained in B and C respectively. Any amalgam D on {1,2,3,4,5,6} must specify f on the six “cross” 4-sets\n- X_{ij} := {i,j,5,6}, for 1≤i<j≤4 (these are exactly the 4-sets not contained in B or C).\nWrite variables x_{ij} ∈ {±1} for f(X_{ij}). All other f-values are determined by B and C.\n\nThe only 5-sets Y in D that can introduce new constraints (relative to B and C) are\n- Y_k := {5,6} ∪ (A\\{k}) for k=1,2,3,4.\nFor each k, the 5-tuple p(Y_k) has two fixed coordinates:\n- p missing 6 is p^B_k := f_B({5} ∪ (A\\{k})) (a 4-set inside B),\n- p missing 5 is p^C_k := f_C({6} ∪ (A\\{k})) (a 4-set inside C),\nand three variable coordinates corresponding to the three 4-sets missing each of the three elements of A\\{k}, namely x_{ij} with {i,j} = (A\\{k})\\{ℓ} as ℓ ranges over A\\{k}. Concretely,\n- Y_1 depends on {x_{23}, x_{24}, x_{34}},\n- Y_2 depends on {x_{13}, x_{14}, x_{34}},\n- Y_3 depends on {x_{12}, x_{14}, x_{24}},\n- Y_4 depends on {x_{12}, x_{13}, x_{23}}.\n\nConstraint: For each k, we must choose the three variables so that the resulting 5-tuple p(Y_k) is not isomorphic to O_5 (i.e., p(Y_k) ∉ orbit_G(e1)). This is the entire constraint system for the one-point amalgamation step.\n\nA necessary (but not sufficient) sub-constraint\nIn the special case p^B_k=+1 and p^C_k=−1 for all k (achievable by taking B of type C_5 with “all positive” and C of type C_5 with a relabelling so that k∈A all yield “negative” while A’s 4-set itself remains +1), an immediate necessary condition to avoid O_5 in Y_k is that not all three variables in its triple are −1; otherwise p(Y_k) has exactly one + under the ambient enumeration (coming from the “missing 6” coordinate), which is already the canonical O_5 representative.\nIn terms of the 6 variables on the edges of K_4 on A, the four triples are exactly the edge-sets of the four 3-vertex faces (triangles) of K_4: each Y_k corresponds to the triangle on A\\{k}. Thus the necessary condition reads: every triangle of K_4 must contain at least one + variable. This is satisfiable, e.g., by setting x_{12}=x_{34}=+1 and all other x_{ij}=−1 (a perfect matching of +’s). Hence, forcing O_5 in this case cannot be achieved merely by the “identity-isomorphism” obstruction.\n\nWhy this is useful. This reduction isolates the exact degrees of freedom and shows the one-point amalgamation problem is a small finite CSP on 6 variables with 4 constraints. It suggests a feasible computational approach and indicates that any counterexample to AP (if it exists) must rely on the full isomorphism classification (not just the “exactly one +” under the fixed enumeration).\n\nPlan to decide AP\n- Step A (computational classification on 5 points). Compute the orbit G·e1 ⊆ {±1}^5 explicitly by generating the 120 matrices M(τ) and applying them to the seed e1=(+,-,-,-,-). Likewise, fix representatives for C_5 and H_5 to cross-check. This yields a precise membership test “p ∈ O_5?” for a 5-vector p in the fixed ambient enumeration.\n- Step B (solve the 6-variable CSP for one-point amalgamation). Given p^B,p^C for B and C (both O_5-free on their 5-sets), enumerate the 2^6 assignments of x_{ij} and eliminate those for which some Y_k yields p(Y_k) ∈ O_5 (using membership from Step A). If at least one assignment survives, the one-point amalgamation exists for that (A,B,C). Repeat over all possibilities of p^B and p^C (up to isomorphism and compatibility on A) to decide whether the one-point amalgamation always exists.\n- Step C (deduce AP). If Step B always succeeds, AP holds by Lemma 2. If there is a failing triple (A,B,C), we have a concrete counterexample witnessing failure of AP.\n\nRemarks/conjectures to guide the search\n- Because there are only three 5-point isomorphism types, p^B and p^C (subject to agreeing on the A-4-set value) range over finitely many patterns up to the shared labelling of A; the search space is tiny.\n- Heuristic: in the symmetric case p^B_k=+ and p^C_k=− for all k, the matching assignment x_{12}=x_{34}=+, others − is a natural candidate. It satisfies the necessary “no identity-O_5” condition discussed above. I conjecture (to be verified computationally) that for each Y_k the resulting 5-vector p(Y_k) actually falls into C_5 or H_5, not O_5.\n- If this conjecture holds in the most constrained symmetric case, it is plausible that one-point amalgamation always succeeds, hence H has AP. But this requires a check across all p^B,p^C patterns, not just the symmetric one.\n\nWhat is rigorously established here\n- The orientation function model (Lemma 1) and the exact reduction of one-point amalgamation to a finite 6-variable CSP with four 5-point constraints have been stated and justified.\n- The sufficiency of one-point amalgamation for full AP (Lemma 2) has been argued.\n- A necessary condition in a key symmetric case has been analyzed and shown satisfiable, indicating nontriviality and guiding further work.\n\nImmediate next actions for the verifier\n1) Implement Step A to compute the O_5-orbit in {±1}^5 under the action p' = (ε_i(τ)·p_{τ^{-1}(i)})_i. This gives a function IsO5(p) on 5-bit patterns in the fixed enumeration.\n2) Implement Step B for the one-point amalgamation CSP:\n   - Input: p^B,p^C consistent with A (i.e., the value on A itself agrees in B and C).\n   - Variables: x_{ij} for 1≤i<j≤4.\n   - For each k=1..4, form the 5-vector p(Y_k) with coordinates: missing 6 → p^B_k; missing 5 → p^C_k; and the three “missing a” coordinates given by the relevant x_{ij} as listed above.\n   - Reject any assignment if IsO5(p(Y_k)) is true for some k; accept otherwise.\n3) Exhaust over the finitely many p^B,p^C (modulo relabellings of A consistent across B and C) to determine whether one-point amalgamation always succeeds. If yes, conclude H has AP by Lemma 2. If no, record a concrete failing triple (A,B,C), which witnesses that H does not have AP.\n\nPotential pitfalls to watch for\n- When enumerating p^B,p^C possibilities, ensure the shared A-4-set has the same f-value in B and in C. This is necessary because A must be a common induced substructure.\n- Beware that changing the ambient enumeration of V changes the raw p-vectors; the membership test IsO5 must be invariantly computed via the group action as above, not by counting pluses.\n\nSummary\n- We have reduced the AP question for H to a small, explicit, and checkable one-point amalgamation CSP on 6 variables with four constraints, each constraint being the avoidance of the O_5-orbit for a concrete 5-vector.\n- A simple necessary condition in a symmetric case does not force a contradiction, suggesting that amalgamation may be possible in nontrivial scenarios.\n- A short computational check (Steps A–B) should decide AP. If the one-point amalgamation always works, AP follows by iterating one-point amalgamations (Lemma 2). If a counterexample exists, the same check will find it and witness failure of AP.\n\nGaps to fill in future rounds\n- Complete the explicit computation of the O_5 orbit and the CSP feasibility in all cases of p^B,p^C to settle the AP decisively.\n- Optionally, extract conceptual invariants distinguishing the orbits C_5, O_5, H_5 to replace the computational step with a direct argument, if feasible."}
