  "summary_md": "Both provers independently reduce the AP question for H (finite 4-hypertournaments forbidding O_5) to a small, finite, auditable constraint problem: encode a 4-hypertournament by an alternating ±1 function f on 4-sets, observe that forbidding O_5 is a local 5-set constraint, and note that AP reduces to checking one-point amalgamation. The minimal nontrivial case is |A|=4: the problem becomes a 6-variable Boolean CSP (variables x_{ij} for pairs in A) with four local 5-set constraints (each must avoid the O_5 orbit). Prover-01 emphasizes the switching operation (multiply f by ε-products) which preserves the O_5/non-O_5 partition and gives normalization power; Prover-02 gives a clean orientation-function formalism and isolates the precise 6-variable CSP and a necessary-triangle condition in a symmetric case. Both provide explicit canonical templates for C5,H5,O5, and an explicit, small computational plan to decide the |A|=3 and |A|=4 cases by enumerating S5-orbits and brute-force searching the CSP. Verifier remains \"uncertain\" pending these computations. (Sources: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json.)",
  "highlights": [
    "4-hypertournaments ↔ arbitrary function f:[V]^4 → {±1}; forbidding O_5 is a purely local constraint on 5-sets (5-tuples of f-values).",
    "Switching at a vertex (multiply signs on 4-sets containing that vertex) preserves the 4-hypertournament axioms and preserves the O_5 vs (C_5∪H_5) partition — useful for normalization.",
    "AP reduces to one-point amalgamation: it suffices to check amalgams of B=A∪{b} and C=A∪{c} over A; only 5-sets Y_T = T∪{b,c} for T∈[A]^3 can create new O_5s.",
    "Minimal nontrivial case |A|=4 gives a 6-variable CSP (variables x_{ij} for edges of K_4) with four constraints (one per omitted vertex); the search space is tiny (2^6 per input case).",
    "Trivial positive results: one-point amalgamation automatically holds for |A|≤2; |A|=3 can be settled by enumerating the 8 assignments once the O_5 orbit is explicit.",
    "A concrete constructive ansatz is proposed: set z_{ij} = w_i w_j with w_i := β(i)α(i); if this avoids O_5 on every 5-set it yields a uniform solution and suggests a general proof.",
    "A necessary (but not decisive) condition in a symmetric case is that every triangle of K_4 contain at least one + variable; this is satisfiable (e.g., a matching of +’s) so no immediate obstruction was found."

  "next_questions": [
    "Run the explicit computations: (a) enumerate the S5-orbits of the canonical C5,H5,O5 templates to implement IsO5(p); (b) exhaustively solve the one-point CSP for |A|=3 and |A|=4 across all B,C patterns that agree on A. If any (B,C) has no solution, produce a minimal certificate (values α,β and why every assignment yields an O_5). (prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json)",
    "Verify switching invariance by enumeration and test the constructive ansatz z_{ij}=w_i w_j across all |A|=4 cases; if it always succeeds, attempt to convert this into a general (non-computational) proof or use LLL-style probabilistic arguments to extend to larger |A|.",
    "If the exhaustive search finds no counterexample at |A|=4, attempt an inductive or probabilistic argument (or a direct constructive proof using the ansatz) to lift one-point amalgamation to full AP; if a counterexample is found, prepare a human-readable certificate and analyze its combinatorial pattern."
