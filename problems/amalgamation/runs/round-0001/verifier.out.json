  "feedback_md": "High-level assessment\nBoth reports make solid progress by (i) recasting 4\u2011hypertournaments via an orientation function f:[V]^4\u2192{\u00b11}, (ii) reducing AP to one\u2011point amalgamation, and (iii) formulating the one\u2011point step for |A|=4 as a finite CSP with six cross variables and four 5\u2011set constraints. This is the right reduction and gives an auditable path to a definitive decision.\n\nCorrections and rigor audit\n- Orientation function model (Prover 02, Lemma 1): Correct. For each 4\u2011set S, choosing one parity class determines R on S and choices across different S are independent. This is the cleanest formalism and we adopt it.\n- One\u2011point amalgamation suffices for AP (both): Correct. The iterative addition of vertices c1,\u2026,ck to B preserves H because at step i every 5\u2011set involving ci is controlled by the one\u2011point amalgamation at that step, including those with previously added vertices (they lie in the current base Ai).\n- CSP formulation for |A|=4 (both): Correct. The only unknown f\u2011values are on the six cross 4\u2011sets X_{ij}={i,j,b,c}, and the only new 5\u2011sets are Y_k={b,c}\u222a(A\\{k}). Each Y_k depends on three variables and two fixed bits p^B_k, p^C_k.\n- Misstatement about \u201cswitching\u201d (Prover 01): The claim \u201cswitching preserves being O5 vs non\u2011O5\u201d for a fixed 5\u2011set is false. Example: for p=(+,-,-,-,-) (an O5 representative), switching at the vertex corresponding to the unique \u2018+\u2019 flips the other four coordinates, yielding (+,+,+,+,+) (a C5 representative). So switching changes the local 5\u2011type; it does not preserve O5/non\u2011O5 on a fixed 5\u2011set. It does preserve the 4\u2011hypertournament axioms globally.\n- Representatives and sign conventions: The two reports choose different canonical 5\u2011vectors for C5/H5/O5. That\u2019s fine as long as Step A computes the full S5\u2011orbit of O5 under the correct action p\u21a6(\u03b5_i(\u03c4)\u00b7p_{\u03c4^{-1}(i)}) and tests membership invariantly. Do not rely on the raw count of \u201c+\u201d entries.\n- |A|\u22642 one\u2011point step: Trivial and correct; no 5\u2011set constraints exist. |A|=3: Prover 01\u2019s \u201c<8\u201d count of O5 among the 2^3 assignments is plausible but unproven here; we should settle it by the orbit computation (Step A) and a tiny enumeration.\n\nPromising directions and concrete next steps\n1) Implement Step A once and for all: compute the O5 orbit in {\u00b11}^5 via p\u21a6(\u03b5_i(\u03c4)\u00b7p_{\u03c4^{-1}(i)}). Produce a function IsO5(p).\n2) One\u2011point, |A|=3: For each (\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2208{\u00b11}^2, enumerate the 8 triples and count how many yield O5 for the unique 5\u2011set; record that at least one choice avoids O5. This will put the |A|=3 case on record.\n3) One\u2011point, |A|=4: Enumerate all compatible (B,C) up to relabeling of A (B and C of types C5 or H5, agreeing on f(A)). For each pair, solve the 6\u2011variable CSP by brute force using IsO5 on Y_k, k=1..4. Either find an unsatisfiable case (certifies AP fails) or certify satisfiability for all pairs (strong evidence toward AP).\n4) Precompute local constraint sets F(\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2286{\u00b11}^3: the allowed triples for a 5\u2011set given its two fixed coordinates. This collapses the |A|=4 CSP to four membership tests in precomputed sets and isolates the true obstruction structure.\n5) Optional constructive ansatz to test: x_{ij}=w_iw_j with w_i:=\u03b1(i)\u03b2(i) for i\u2208A. If it always passes, it yields a uniform construction for all |A|; otherwise the failing pattern will guide a counterexample.\n\nKey cautions\n- Do not use switching to enlarge allowed sets; it alters B and C as well as the 5\u2011types, so it is not a safe normalization for the fixed one\u2011point diagram.\n- Ensure the compatibility condition on the common 4\u2011set A is enforced when enumerating B and C.\n",

This satisfies (i) tuples have distinct entries, (ii) closure under even permutations, (iii) exactly one of (x1,x2,x3,x4) and (x2,x1,x3,x4) lies in R.\n- For a 5\u2011set X, define its 5\u2011vector p(X)\u2208{\u00b11}^X by p_x:=f(X\\{x}). Isomorphisms act by p\u21a6(\u03b5_i(\u03c4)\u00b7p_{\u03c4^{-1}(i)}) with \u03b5_i(\u03c4)=sign of \u03c4 restricted to X\\{\u03c4^{-1}(i)}. The three isomorphism types on 5 points are denoted C5, H5, O5. For computation we may use representatives C5=(+,+,+,+,+), O5=(+,-,-,-,-), H5=(+,-,+,-,+); the orbit relation is determined by the above action (not by raw counts of pluses).\n\nOne\u2011point amalgamation reduction\n- AP for H (class of finite 4\u2011hypertournaments with no induced O5) reduces to the one\u2011point case: Given A\u2208H, B=A\u222a{b}\u2208H, C=A\u222a{c}\u2208H with B\u2229C=A, existence of D on A\u222a{b,c} in H extending B and C implies full AP by iteratively adding the vertices of C\\A to B.\n\nCSP for the minimal nontrivial one\u2011point case |A|=4\n- Fix A={1,2,3,4}, b=5, c=6. The only undetermined f\u2011values are the six cross 4\u2011sets X_{ij}={i,j,5,6} (1\u2264i<j\u22644). Let variables x_{ij}:=f(X_{ij})\u2208{\u00b11}.\n- The only potentially new 5\u2011sets are Y_k:={5,6}\u222a(A\\{k}) for k\u2208{1,2,3,4}. For each k, p(Y_k) has two fixed coordinates: p missing 6 equals p^B_k:=f_B({5}\u222a(A\\{k})), and p missing 5 equals p^C_k:=f_C({6}\u222a(A\\{k})); and three variable coordinates drawn from {x_{ij}} on the three pairs inside A\\{k}:\n  \u2022 Y_1 depends on {x_{23},x_{24},x_{34}}\n  \u2022 Y_2 depends on {x_{13},x_{14},x_{34}}\n  \u2022 Y_3 depends on {x_{12},x_{14},x_{24}}\n  \u2022 Y_4 depends on {x_{12},x_{13},x_{23}}.\n- Constraint: For each k, p(Y_k) must not lie in the O5\u2011orbit. This is the complete constraint system for the one\u2011point amalgam over A of size 4.\n\nBase sizes |A|\u22642 and |A|=3\n- |A|\u22642: There are no 5\u2011sets Y; any assignment to cross 4\u2011sets works, so one\u2011point amalgamation always succeeds.\n- |A|=3: There is exactly one 5\u2011set Y=A\u222a{b,c}, with two fixed coordinates (those missing b and c) and three unknowns (those missing each a\u2208A). We expect (and plan to verify computationally) that for every (\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2208{\u00b11}^2 at least one of the 8 assignments to the three unknowns avoids the O5 orbit. This settles one\u2011point amalgamation at size 3 once verified.\n\nSwitching: what it does and what it does not\n- For \u03b5:V\u2192{\u00b11}, define f^\u03b5(S):=(\u220f_{v\u2208S}\u03b5(v))\u00b7f(S). Then f^\u03b5 encodes another 4\u2011hypertournament.\n- Caution: For a fixed 5\u2011set X, switching at a vertex v\u2208X flips the four coordinates of p(X) corresponding to the 4\u2011sets that contain v and leaves the coordinate \u201cmissing v\u201d unchanged. This can change the 5\u2011type: e.g., (+,-,-,-,-) (an O5 representative) switches at the \u2018+\u2019 vertex to (+,+,+,+,+) (a C5 representative). Thus switching is not a valid normalization trick for fixed one\u2011point data (B,C) in H.\n\nComputational plan (to settle |A|=3 and |A|=4)\n- Step A: Compute the O5 orbit via the S5 action above; implement IsO5(p).\n- Step B (|A|=3): For each (\u03b1,\u03b2), enumerate the 8 triples, test IsO5, and record that at least one choice avoids O5.\n- Step C (|A|=4): Enumerate compatible (B,C) (both of type C5 or H5, agreeing on f(A)), form p^B_k,p^C_k (k=1..4), and brute\u2011force the 2^6 choices of x_{ij}, rejecting any assignment for which some Y_k is O5. Record either a counterexample or certify all cases pass.\n- Precompute F(\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2286{\u00b11}^3: the allowed triples for a 5\u2011set with given two fixed coordinates. Then the |A|=4 CSP checks membership of the four triangle\u2011triples in F(p^B_k,p^C_k).\n\nConstructive ansatz to test\n- Try x_{ij}=w_iw_j with w_i:=p^B_i\u00b7p^C_i for i\u2208A. For T={i,j,k} this gives a triple (w_iw_j,w_iw_k,w_jw_k) of product +1. If this never yields O5 for any (p^B_k,p^C_k), it provides a uniform construction for all |A| (worth testing; not proved).",

  "new_outputs_md": "Proposition 1 (Orientation function model).\nFor a finite set V, giving a 4\u2011hypertournament structure (V,R) satisfying: (i) all tuples in R have distinct entries; (ii) R is closed under even permutations of coordinates; (iii) for every 4\u2011tuple of distinct vertices (x1,x2,x3,x4), exactly one of (x1,x2,x3,x4) and (x2,x1,x3,x4) lies in R; is equivalent to giving an arbitrary function f:[V]^4\u2192{\u00b11}.\nProof. Given f, declare (x1,x2,x3,x4)\u2208R iff the permutation from the increasing ordering of S={x1,x2,x3,x4} to (x1,\u2026,x4) has sign equal to f(S). This satisfies (i)\u2013(iii) by construction. Conversely, given R with (i)\u2013(iii), fix any 4\u2011set S and any increasing ordering s of S. By (iii), exactly one of s and its swap lies in R; define f(S)=+1 if s\u2208R and f(S)=\u22121 otherwise. By (ii) and (iii), membership of any ordered tuple from S depends only on the parity relative to s, so f is well defined and recovers R. \u220e\n\nLemma 2 (One\u2011point amalgamation suffices for AP in H).\nLet H be the class of finite 4\u2011hypertournaments omitting O5. Suppose that whenever A\u2208H and B=A\u222a{b}\u2208H and C=A\u222a{c}\u2208H with B\u2229C=A, there exists D\u2208H on A\u222a{b,c} extending both B and C. Then H has the amalgamation property.\nProof. Given B0,B1\u2208H over A, enumerate C\\A as c1,\u2026,ck and set A0:=A. Inductively, amalgamate Bi with Ai\u222a{ci} over Ai to obtain Bi+1 on Ai+1:=Ai\u222a{ci}. At each step, by hypothesis, all 5\u2011sets involving the new vertex ci avoid O5, and previously constructed parts are unchanged. After k steps we obtain an amalgam D\u2208H of B0 and C over A. \u220e\n\nProposition 3 (CSP formulation of the |A|=4 one\u2011point step).\nLet A={1,2,3,4}, b, c new. Given B on A\u222a{b} and C on A\u222a{c} in H that agree on A, any amalgam D on A\u222a{b,c} is determined on new 4\u2011sets by the six values x_{ij}:=f({i,j,b,c}) (1\u2264i<j\u22644). The only new 5\u2011sets are Y_k:={b,c}\u222a(A\\{k}) for k=1,2,3,4. Writing p^B_k:=f_B({b}\u222a(A\\{k})) and p^C_k:=f_C({c}\u222a(A\\{k})), the 5\u2011vector p(Y_k) has two fixed coordinates (missing c gives p^B_k; missing b gives p^C_k) and three coordinates equal to the x_{ij} for {i,j}\u2282A\\{k}. D\u2208H iff for each k, p(Y_k) is not in the O5 orbit.\nProof. All 4\u2011sets contained in B or C are already fixed. The only 4\u2011sets not contained in B or C are precisely the six X_{ij}={i,j,b,c}. The only new 5\u2011subsets of A\u222a{b,c} (relative to B and C) are those that contain both b and c; there are exactly four, the Y_k. Their p\u2011vectors depend on the listed values. Avoidance of O5 on all 5\u2011sets is thus equivalent to the stated four constraints. \u220e\n\nCorollary 4 (Trivial one\u2011point cases |A|\u22642).\nIf |A|\u22642, then one\u2011point amalgamation always succeeds in H.\nProof. When |A|\u22642 there are no 3\u2011subsets of A, hence no 5\u2011sets of the form {b,c}\u222aT with T\u2282A of size 3. Thus there are no new 5\u2011set constraints; any assignment to cross 4\u2011sets yields an amalgam in H. \u220e\n\nFact 5 (Switching yields a 4\u2011hypertournament but may change 5\u2011types).\nFor \u03b5:V\u2192{\u00b11}, define f^\u03b5(S):=(\u220f_{v\u2208S}\u03b5(v))\u00b7f(S). Then f^\u03b5 encodes a 4\u2011hypertournament. However, for a fixed 5\u2011set X, switching at v\u2208X flips the four coordinates of p(X) corresponding to 4\u2011sets containing v and leaves the coordinate \u201cmissing v\u201d unchanged; this can change the isomorphism type on X (e.g., an O5 representative (+,-,-,-,-) switches at its \u2018+\u2019 vertex to (+,+,+,+,+), a C5 representative). \u220e",
