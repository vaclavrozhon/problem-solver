--- SYSTEM ---
You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md and outputs.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers
- notes.md (summary so far)
- outputs.md (rigorously proven results so far)

Guidelines:
- notes.md: should be a readable running log of interesting work. Prefer appending. Replace only if old notes are clearly misleading.
- outputs.md: should be concise and rigorous. Keep only proven theorems with clear proofs. If a statement is flawed and you cannot fix it, remove it from outputs.md and instead add it to notes.md with explanation.
- Be careful with the booleans `new_notes_append` and `new_outputs_append`: default is True (append). Use False only when deliberately rewriting everything.

Tasks:
1) Audit rigor: identify unjustified steps, false statements, missing lemmas; produce minimal counterexamples.
2) Triage value: separate genuine progress from noise.
3) Guide next steps: propose what provers should try next.

[{"prover_id": "01", "markdown_md": "Status of outputs.md: Not provided. I cannot check for gaps there.\n\nGoal: Decide whether H (finite 4-hypertournaments with no O_5) has the amalgamation property (AP). I aim to make incremental, auditable progress. Below I formalize the problem in a way that reduces AP to a finite local constraint problem, isolate \u201cone-point amalgamation\u201d, and give tools/lemmas and a concrete computational plan that the verifier can run. I also point out promising directions (and risks) toward a proof or counterexample.\n\n1) Reformulation via alternating 4-forms\n- A 4-hypertournament on a finite set V can be encoded by an alternating \u00b11-valued function f on ordered 4-tuples:\n  f(x1,x2,x3,x4) = +1 iff (x1,x2,x3,x4) \u2208 R; and for any permutation \u03c3 \u2208 S4,\n  f(x_{\u03c3(1)},...,x_{\u03c3(4)}) = sgn(\u03c3) \u00b7 f(x1,...,x4).\n  This is just condition (2)+(3) restated: odd permutations flip membership; even preserve.\n- For each 5-element set Y = {y1,...,y5}, define its \u201c5-vector\u201d s(Y) = (s1,...,s5) by si = f(Y\\{yi}) computed on the increasing order of Y\\{yi}. This depends on the chosen linear order on Y, but isomorphism type of the induced 5-vertex substructure is independent of order and is one of three: C5, H5, or O5 (given in the problem).\n- H consists of those structures in which, for every 5-subset Y, the restriction is isomorphic to C5 or H5 (never O5).\n\n2) Switching at a vertex (useful normalization tool)\n- Define: \u201cSwitching at v\u201d toggles the sign of f on every ordered 4-tuple that contains v (equivalently, multiply f by -1 on those 4-sets and leave others unchanged). Formally, for \u03b5:V\u2192{\u00b11}, define the switched f^\u03b5 by\n  f^\u03b5(x1,x2,x3,x4) = (\u03b5(x1)\u03b5(x2)\u03b5(x3)\u03b5(x4)) \u00b7 f(x1,x2,x3,x4).\n- Lemma (Switching lemma): Switching preserves the 4-hypertournament axioms. Moreover, for a fixed 5-set Y, applying a switch on any vertex of Y takes a 5-type C5 to H5 or C5 (depending on which vertex), and never to O5; similarly switching preserves being O5 vs non-O5.\n  Proof sketch: Alternation under S4 is preserved since we multiply f by a product that is invariant under even permutations and flips under odd permutations exactly once per coordinate involved; the local 5-type class C5\u222aH5 is the switching orbit avoiding O5 (known in oriented matroid folklore on 5 elements; see Note at end for a computation plan to verify this fact explicitly).\n- Why useful: It shows forbidding O5 is invariant under switching. When seeking amalgams, one can sometimes normalize local data by pretending to switch on yet-unknown vertices (conceptually) to reduce cases, while remembering that B and C are fixed (so actual switches cannot be applied to them\u2014this is just a reasoning aid).\n\n3) Reduction of AP to one-point amalgamation\n- Standard reduction for relational languages with local (finite) constraints: It suffices to check amalgamation when C is obtained from A by adding a single new vertex, and similarly B (so-called one-point amalgamation). If one-point amalgamation always works inside H, then by adding the vertices of C\\A one by one to B and extending at each step, we construct D containing both B and C.\n- In our setting, the only potential new forbidden substructures when we add one vertex c to A\u222a{b} arise on 5-sets of the form Y_T := T \u222a {b,c} where T ranges over 3-subsets of A. All 5-sets contained entirely in B or entirely in C are already in H by assumption.\n\n4) The one-point amalgamation constraint system\n- Fix A, |A|=m\u22653, and suppose B = A \u222a {b} and C = A \u222a {c} are in H (so A is an induced common substructure).\n- For each T \u2208 [A]^3 (3-subsets), consider the 5-set Y_T := T \u222a {b,c}. The 4-subsets of Y_T are:\n  \u2022 \u0394_b := Y_T\\{b} = {c} \u222a T, whose sign is fixed by C; write \u03b1(t) for this sign, where t is the unique element of A\\T (so T = A\\{t}).\n  \u2022 \u0394_c := Y_T\\{c} = {b} \u222a T, fixed by B; write \u03b2(t) analogously (again t = A\\T).\n  \u2022 For each x \u2208 T, \u0394_x := Y_T\\{x} = {b,c} \u222a (T\\{x}). These are cross 4-sets not in B or C; their signs are our decision variables.\n- Thus the unknowns are the signs z_P \u2208 {\u00b11} for each pair P \u2208 [A]^2, interpreted as z_{ij} = sign on the 4-set {b,c,i,j} ordered increasingly. For a given T = {i,j,k} = A\\{t}, the triple of unknowns entering Y_T is (z_{ij}, z_{ik}, z_{jk}). The fixed pair for Y_T is (\u03b1(t), \u03b2(t)).\n- Constraint: For each t \u2208 A, the 5-vertex structure on Y_T with the above five signs must be isomorphic to C5 or H5 (i.e., not O5). This gives 4 constraints when |A|=4 (the minimally nontrivial one-point case) on the 6 variables z_{ij}, and in general (m choose 3) constraints on (m choose 2) variables.\n- This is a finite constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) depending only on the two 5-types B and C over A.\n\n5) Two immediate base cases\n- Trivial cases for one-point amalgamation:\n  \u2022 If |A| \u2264 2: There is no 5-set Y_T at all, so any assignment of cross 4-sets works. Hence one-point amalgamation holds.\n  \u2022 If |A| = 3: There is exactly one Y = A \u222a {b,c}, with two fixed signs \u03b1,\u03b2 and three unknowns. At least one assignment of the three unknowns avoids O5, because the number of O5 realisations among the 2^3 possible triples is strictly less than 8 (details can be verified computationally from the explicit 5-type templates below). This delivers one-point amalgamation for |A|=3.\n  Action item for verifier: Explicitly enumerate the orbit of O5 under all 120 relabelings (using the canonical labeled template described in \u00a76) and count, for each fixed pair (\u03b1,\u03b2), how many 3-bit triples produce O5. It should be < 8 for all 4 pairs (\u03b1,\u03b2), completing a rigorous proof for |A|=3.\n\n6) Concrete canonical 5-type templates (for computation)\n- We need explicit labeled representatives of C5, H5, O5 to feed into the CSP described above. The problem statement already provides a convenient encoding: \u201cpositive vertices\u201d among {1,2,3,4,5} equal the indices i such that the increasing 4-tuple (1,...,i-1,i+1,...,5) is in R.\n- Choose the following explicit labeled representatives:\n  \u2022 C5: positive set S_C = \u2205.\n  \u2022 H5: positive set S_H = {1,3,5}.\n  \u2022 O5: positive set S_O = {2}.\n- From any such positive set S \u2286 {1,...,5}, define the 5-vertex 4-hypertournament R_S by: For a 4-tuple whose underlying set is {1,...,5}\\{i}, the increasing 4-tuple is in R_S iff i \u2208 S; then close under even permutations and exclude the odd ones.\n- Note: Different enumerations of the same unlabeled 5-type correspond to relabeling the vertices by a permutation \u03c0 \u2208 S5. Our \u201cswitching at a vertex\u201d (\u03b5) operation is also available to generate variants. The type classification is the orbit under isomorphisms; O5\u2019s orbit should be disjoint from the union of C5\u2019s and H5\u2019s orbits even after switching, which the verifier can confirm by enumeration.\n\n7) Computational test for |A|=4 (minimal nontrivial one-point case)\n- Fix A = {1,2,3,4}. Let B be a 5-vertex 4-hypertournament on {1,2,3,4,b} that is either C5 or H5; similarly C on {1,2,3,4,c}. They must agree on A (i.e., the sign on the ordered 4-tuple (1,2,3,4) must be the same in both B and C). This determines \u03b2(\u2219) = signs for {b}\u222a(A\\{t}) inside B, and \u03b1(\u2219) analogously from C.\n- Unknowns: z_{12}, z_{13}, z_{14}, z_{23}, z_{24}, z_{34} \u2208 {\u00b11}.\n- Constraints: For t \u2208 {1,2,3,4}, define T = A\\{t} (a 3-subset). Consider the 5-set Y_T = T \u222a {b,c}. Its five \u201ccoordinates\u201d (in the sense of \u00a74) are the triple (z_ij) over pairs in T and the fixed pair (\u03b1(t),\u03b2(t)). We must ensure that Y_T is isomorphic to C5 or H5 (i.e., its labeled 5-vector lies in the orbit of S_C or S_H under relabeling and switching). Equivalently, the triple (z_ij) must lie in an allowed set F_t(\u03b1(t),\u03b2(t)), which is the projection of the C5\u222aH5 orbit for those two fixed coordinates.\n- Decision procedure:\n  1. Enumerate all labeled B of type C5 or H5 on {1,2,3,4,5} that realize both possibilities for the sign on the A 4-tuple (delete 5), then rename 5\u2192b. Similarly enumerate all labeled C on {1,2,3,4,6}, rename 6\u2192c. This yields all possibilities for (\u03b1,\u03b2) patterns consistent with H.\n  2. For each pair (B,C), form the allowed sets F_t(\u03b1(t),\u03b2(t)) for t=1..4 by enumerating all relabelings \u03c0 of the canonical C5 and H5 templates in \u00a76 and recording the triples of coordinates corresponding to the three T-coordinates when the two fixed coordinates are forced to equal (\u03b1(t),\u03b2(t)). Switching operations at any of the five vertices can be included to enlarge the allowed set if we treat \u201cswitching\u201d as preserving the C5\u222aH5 class.\n  3. Solve the 6-variable CSP: choose z_{ij} \u2208 {\u00b11} so that for all four t, the triple over pairs in T lies in F_t.\n  4. If for some (B,C) this CSP is unsatisfiable, we have a concrete counterexample to AP (|A|=4), hence H fails AP. If all CSPs are satisfiable for |A|=4, this strongly suggests one-point amalgamation holds at this size; see \u00a78 for extending to larger |A|.\n- This is a tiny search (bounded by a few hundred cases) and should be readily machine-checkable.\n\n8) Extending beyond |A|=4\n- If one-point amalgamation holds for |A|=4 (and |A|\u22643 is already settled), I conjecture it holds for all |A|, via the same CSP approach: variables z_P for P\u2208[A]^2, constraints per T\u2208[A]^3 that the 5-set on T\u222a{b,c} is in C5\u222aH5. This is a (m choose 2)-variable CSP with (m choose 3) local constraints, each depending on exactly three variables. A general existence theorem (e.g., a version of the Lov\u00e1sz Local Lemma) could apply if, for a random assignment, each local bad event (becoming O5) has probability < 1/4 and dependency is bounded by O(m); but we need the exact count of forbidden triples per (\u03b1,\u03b2) to use LLL. Alternatively, a direct constructive assignment might exist (see next bullet).\n- Constructive Ansatz to test: z_{ij} := w_i w_j where w_i := \u03b2(i) \u03b1(i) for i \u2208 A. Then for T={i,j,k}, the triple equals (w_i w_j, w_i w_k, w_j w_k), which automatically has product +1. Hypothesis: For any (\u03b1,\u03b2), the induced 5-set Y_T with triple (w_i w_j, w_i w_k, w_j w_k) and fixed pair (\u03b1(t),\u03b2(t)) cannot be O5. If true, this gives a uniform solution for all |A|. This hypothesis is natural from \u201cswitching/chirotope\u201d heuristics, but I do not claim it as proven here. It is amenable to computational verification in the |A|=4 case; if it passes, we gain strong evidence and a template for a general proof.\n\n9) What would falsify AP?\n- To refute AP, it suffices to find |A|=4 and B,C\u2208H over A such that the 6-variable CSP has no solution. By the above algorithm, this reduces to finite explicit checking. If such a pair exists, AP fails.\n- Heuristic reason it might fail: Although forbidding O5 is a local 5-set condition, it imposes nontrivial compatibility across overlapping 5-sets. This is reminiscent of oriented matroid Grassmann\u2013Pl\u00fccker constraints, which are not purely local in a free-amalgamation sense; hence two O5-free one-point extensions may \u201cforce\u201d an O5 across the overlap. The CSP search is the correct way to catch this phenomenon.\n\n10) Actionable items for the verifier\n- Implement the canonical labeled templates for C5,H5,O5 from \u00a76 (positive sets S_C=\u2205, S_H={1,3,5}, S_O={2}). Generate their R relations (closure under even permutations, exclude odd). Verify that these three are pairwise non-isomorphic and that switching (\u03b5 at any vertex) preserves the partition (C5\u222aH5) vs O5.\n- For |A|=3: For each (\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2208{\u00b11}^2, count how many of the 8 assignments to the three unknown coordinates yield an O5 5-set; check it is <8 to conclude existence of a good assignment. This would rigorously establish one-point amalgamation for |A|=3.\n- For |A|=4: Enumerate all pairs (B,C) of 5-vertex structures of type C5 or H5 that agree on A, then build and solve the 6-variable CSP described in \u00a77. Either find a counterexample or certify that all pairs allow a solution (proving one-point amalgamation at |A|=4).\n- Optionally test the constructive Ansatz z_{ij}=\u03b1(i)\u03b2(i)\u03b1(j)\u03b2(j) to see if it always succeeds.\n\n11) Summary of contributions (this round)\n- Formalized AP for H as a local 5-set CSP on cross 4-sets in one-point amalgamation. This is auditable and reduces the problem to finite search in the minimal nontrivial case (|A|=4).\n- Established trivial one-point amalgamation for |A|\u22642, and gave a clear, verifiable route for |A|=3.\n- Introduced the switching operation and explained its invariance properties relevant to forbidding O5.\n- Proposed a concrete finite algorithm to decide the |A|=4 case (and thus likely AP), and a plausible constructive assignment pattern that may solve all cases if verified.\n\nOpen points to be clarified/verified next\n- Precisely characterize, by explicit enumeration, the orbit of O5 among 5-vectors under relabeling (and optionally switching), especially to quantify \u201cbad triples\u201d in the |A|=3 and |A|=4 CSPs. This unlocks a rigorous completion of the small cases.\n- If no counterexample is found at |A|=4, design an inductive or probabilistic argument (perhaps via LLL) to extend to all |A|.\n- Alternatively, if a counterexample is found, extract the minimal pattern and provide a clean, human-readable certificate of unsatisfiability (values of \u03b1,\u03b2 per t and an argument why every assignment of z leads to an O5 in some Y_T).\n\nNote to the verifier on reproducibility\n- All steps above can be encoded with small scripts: Relational generation for the three 5-types, orbit enumeration under S5, switching, and a brute-force CSP solver for the 6 unknowns in the |A|=4 case. This will either produce a concrete obstruction (refuting AP) or give strong evidence (and likely a proof) that one-point amalgamation holds, paving the way to a full AP proof.\n"}, {"prover_id": "02", "markdown_md": "Status of outputs.md: not provided. I cannot check prior results; I proceed from the task statement only.\n\nScope and goal\n- We study 4-hypertournaments, i.e., structures (V,R) with a 4-ary relation satisfying injectivity, closure under even permutations, and the \u201cexactly one of (x1,\u2026,x4) and (x2,x1,x3,x4) is in R\u201d condition.\n- For a finite set V, a 4-hypertournament is equivalent to specifying, for each 4-subset S of V, which parity-class of orderings of S lies in R (even vs. odd). Thus, for each 4-set S, we can define an orientation bit f(S) \u2208 {+1,\u22121} that determines all tuples on S.\n- On 5 vertices X, the induced 4-hypertournament type is determined by the 5-tuple of bits p = (p_x)_{x\u2208X} with p_x := f(X\\{x}). Up to isomorphism (permuting X, with the induced parity corrections on the 4-sets), there are exactly three orbits of such 5-tuples, denoted C_5, O_5, H_5 in the task statement.\n- We are to decide whether the class H of all finite 4-hypertournaments omitting O_5 has the amalgamation property (AP).\n\nKey observations and lemmas\n\nLemma 1 (Orientation function viewpoint).\nFor any finite vertex set V, giving a 4-hypertournament structure on V is equivalent to giving an arbitrary function f: [V]^4 \u2192 {\u00b11}. The relation R is then determined by: for a 4-tuple (x1,x2,x3,x4) of distinct vertices, let S={x1,x2,x3,x4}; let \u03c0 be the permutation that maps the increasing ordering of S (in the ambient enumeration of V) to (x1,x2,x3,x4). Then (x1,x2,x3,x4) \u2208 R iff sgn(\u03c0) = f(S).\n\nProof sketch. Conditions (1)\u2013(3) say that for each 4-set S, the membership of an ordered tuple from S in R depends only on the parity of the permutation from a fixed ordering of S. Thus for each S we freely choose whether \u201ceven\u201d or \u201codd\u201d permutations lie in R; choices on different S are independent. Conversely, given f, the above prescription defines a 4-hypertournament.\u220e\n\nConsequences. There are no compatibility constraints between different 4-sets S,T \u2286 V in the definition; all constraints arise only when we forbid an induced O_5 on some 5-set X, i.e., when we constrain the 5-tuple (p_x)_{x\u2208X} not to fall into the O_5 isomorphism class.\n\nNotation for 5-sets and types.\n- For a 5-element set X\u2286V with the ambient enumeration 1<\u22ef<|V|, define p(X) \u2208 {\u00b11}^X by p_x := f(X\\{x}). The induced isomorphism type on X depends only on the orbit of p(X) under the action of S_5 given by p \u21a6 M(\u03c4)p with (M(\u03c4)p)_i = \u03b5_i(\u03c4)\u00b7p_{\u03c4^{-1}(i)}, where \u03b5_i(\u03c4) is the sign of the restriction of \u03c4 to the 4-set X\\{\u03c4^{-1}(i)}. The three orbits are denoted C_5, O_5, H_5.\n- Concretely: representatives include p\u2261(+,+,+,+,+) for C_5, p with exactly one + (and four \u2212) for O_5, and p with + on {1,3,5} and \u2212 on {2,4} for H_5 (indices relative to a chosen enumeration of X). Different enumerations (\u03c4) can permute and flip coordinates (via \u03b5(\u03c4)), so the raw count of +\u2019s is not invariant.\n\nReduction to one-point amalgamation\n\nLemma 2 (One-point amalgamation suffices).\nTo decide AP for H, it suffices to decide the following: whenever A\u2208H and B = A \u222a {b} \u2208 H and C = A \u222a {c} \u2208 H with B\u2229C = A, there exists D \u2208 H on A\u222a{b,c} extending both B and C.\n\nProof sketch. Suppose one-point amalgamation always succeeds. Given arbitrary B,C \u2208 H over A, enumerate the vertices of C\\A as c1,\u2026,ck. Starting with B0 := B, amalgamate Bi with Ai := A \u222a {c1,\u2026,ci\u22121} by a one-point amalgamation with Ci := Ai \u222a {ci} to produce Bi+1 on A \u222a (B\\A) \u222a {c1,\u2026,ci}. Each step preserves membership in H (no O_5 arises on any 5-set entirely inside the old structure, and the newly created 5-sets are controlled by the one-point step). After k steps we obtain D\u2208H containing both B and C over A.\u220e\n\nThus, from now on we focus on |A|=4, B=A\u222a{b}, C=A\u222a{c}.\n\nThe 6-vertex constraint system for one-point amalgamation\nLet A={1,2,3,4}, b=5, c=6. Structures on B and C fix f on all 4-sets contained in B and C respectively. Any amalgam D on {1,2,3,4,5,6} must specify f on the six \u201ccross\u201d 4-sets\n- X_{ij} := {i,j,5,6}, for 1\u2264i<j\u22644 (these are exactly the 4-sets not contained in B or C).\nWrite variables x_{ij} \u2208 {\u00b11} for f(X_{ij}). All other f-values are determined by B and C.\n\nThe only 5-sets Y in D that can introduce new constraints (relative to B and C) are\n- Y_k := {5,6} \u222a (A\\{k}) for k=1,2,3,4.\nFor each k, the 5-tuple p(Y_k) has two fixed coordinates:\n- p missing 6 is p^B_k := f_B({5} \u222a (A\\{k})) (a 4-set inside B),\n- p missing 5 is p^C_k := f_C({6} \u222a (A\\{k})) (a 4-set inside C),\nand three variable coordinates corresponding to the three 4-sets missing each of the three elements of A\\{k}, namely x_{ij} with {i,j} = (A\\{k})\\{\u2113} as \u2113 ranges over A\\{k}. Concretely,\n- Y_1 depends on {x_{23}, x_{24}, x_{34}},\n- Y_2 depends on {x_{13}, x_{14}, x_{34}},\n- Y_3 depends on {x_{12}, x_{14}, x_{24}},\n- Y_4 depends on {x_{12}, x_{13}, x_{23}}.\n\nConstraint: For each k, we must choose the three variables so that the resulting 5-tuple p(Y_k) is not isomorphic to O_5 (i.e., p(Y_k) \u2209 orbit_G(e1)). This is the entire constraint system for the one-point amalgamation step.\n\nA necessary (but not sufficient) sub-constraint\nIn the special case p^B_k=+1 and p^C_k=\u22121 for all k (achievable by taking B of type C_5 with \u201call positive\u201d and C of type C_5 with a relabelling so that k\u2208A all yield \u201cnegative\u201d while A\u2019s 4-set itself remains +1), an immediate necessary condition to avoid O_5 in Y_k is that not all three variables in its triple are \u22121; otherwise p(Y_k) has exactly one + under the ambient enumeration (coming from the \u201cmissing 6\u201d coordinate), which is already the canonical O_5 representative.\nIn terms of the 6 variables on the edges of K_4 on A, the four triples are exactly the edge-sets of the four 3-vertex faces (triangles) of K_4: each Y_k corresponds to the triangle on A\\{k}. Thus the necessary condition reads: every triangle of K_4 must contain at least one + variable. This is satisfiable, e.g., by setting x_{12}=x_{34}=+1 and all other x_{ij}=\u22121 (a perfect matching of +\u2019s). Hence, forcing O_5 in this case cannot be achieved merely by the \u201cidentity-isomorphism\u201d obstruction.\n\nWhy this is useful. This reduction isolates the exact degrees of freedom and shows the one-point amalgamation problem is a small finite CSP on 6 variables with 4 constraints. It suggests a feasible computational approach and indicates that any counterexample to AP (if it exists) must rely on the full isomorphism classification (not just the \u201cexactly one +\u201d under the fixed enumeration).\n\nPlan to decide AP\n- Step A (computational classification on 5 points). Compute the orbit G\u00b7e1 \u2286 {\u00b11}^5 explicitly by generating the 120 matrices M(\u03c4) and applying them to the seed e1=(+,-,-,-,-). Likewise, fix representatives for C_5 and H_5 to cross-check. This yields a precise membership test \u201cp \u2208 O_5?\u201d for a 5-vector p in the fixed ambient enumeration.\n- Step B (solve the 6-variable CSP for one-point amalgamation). Given p^B,p^C for B and C (both O_5-free on their 5-sets), enumerate the 2^6 assignments of x_{ij} and eliminate those for which some Y_k yields p(Y_k) \u2208 O_5 (using membership from Step A). If at least one assignment survives, the one-point amalgamation exists for that (A,B,C). Repeat over all possibilities of p^B and p^C (up to isomorphism and compatibility on A) to decide whether the one-point amalgamation always exists.\n- Step C (deduce AP). If Step B always succeeds, AP holds by Lemma 2. If there is a failing triple (A,B,C), we have a concrete counterexample witnessing failure of AP.\n\nRemarks/conjectures to guide the search\n- Because there are only three 5-point isomorphism types, p^B and p^C (subject to agreeing on the A-4-set value) range over finitely many patterns up to the shared labelling of A; the search space is tiny.\n- Heuristic: in the symmetric case p^B_k=+ and p^C_k=\u2212 for all k, the matching assignment x_{12}=x_{34}=+, others \u2212 is a natural candidate. It satisfies the necessary \u201cno identity-O_5\u201d condition discussed above. I conjecture (to be verified computationally) that for each Y_k the resulting 5-vector p(Y_k) actually falls into C_5 or H_5, not O_5.\n- If this conjecture holds in the most constrained symmetric case, it is plausible that one-point amalgamation always succeeds, hence H has AP. But this requires a check across all p^B,p^C patterns, not just the symmetric one.\n\nWhat is rigorously established here\n- The orientation function model (Lemma 1) and the exact reduction of one-point amalgamation to a finite 6-variable CSP with four 5-point constraints have been stated and justified.\n- The sufficiency of one-point amalgamation for full AP (Lemma 2) has been argued.\n- A necessary condition in a key symmetric case has been analyzed and shown satisfiable, indicating nontriviality and guiding further work.\n\nImmediate next actions for the verifier\n1) Implement Step A to compute the O_5-orbit in {\u00b11}^5 under the action p' = (\u03b5_i(\u03c4)\u00b7p_{\u03c4^{-1}(i)})_i. This gives a function IsO5(p) on 5-bit patterns in the fixed enumeration.\n2) Implement Step B for the one-point amalgamation CSP:\n   - Input: p^B,p^C consistent with A (i.e., the value on A itself agrees in B and C).\n   - Variables: x_{ij} for 1\u2264i<j\u22644.\n   - For each k=1..4, form the 5-vector p(Y_k) with coordinates: missing 6 \u2192 p^B_k; missing 5 \u2192 p^C_k; and the three \u201cmissing a\u201d coordinates given by the relevant x_{ij} as listed above.\n   - Reject any assignment if IsO5(p(Y_k)) is true for some k; accept otherwise.\n3) Exhaust over the finitely many p^B,p^C (modulo relabellings of A consistent across B and C) to determine whether one-point amalgamation always succeeds. If yes, conclude H has AP by Lemma 2. If no, record a concrete failing triple (A,B,C), which witnesses that H does not have AP.\n\nPotential pitfalls to watch for\n- When enumerating p^B,p^C possibilities, ensure the shared A-4-set has the same f-value in B and in C. This is necessary because A must be a common induced substructure.\n- Beware that changing the ambient enumeration of V changes the raw p-vectors; the membership test IsO5 must be invariantly computed via the group action as above, not by counting pluses.\n\nSummary\n- We have reduced the AP question for H to a small, explicit, and checkable one-point amalgamation CSP on 6 variables with four constraints, each constraint being the avoidance of the O_5-orbit for a concrete 5-vector.\n- A simple necessary condition in a symmetric case does not force a contradiction, suggesting that amalgamation may be possible in nontrivial scenarios.\n- A short computational check (Steps A\u2013B) should decide AP. If the one-point amalgamation always works, AP follows by iterating one-point amalgamations (Lemma 2). If a counterexample exists, the same check will find it and witness failure of AP.\n\nGaps to fill in future rounds\n- Complete the explicit computation of the O_5 orbit and the CSP feasibility in all cases of p^B,p^C to settle the AP decisively.\n- Optionally, extract conceptual invariants distinguishing the orbits C_5, O_5, H_5 to replace the computational step with a direct argument, if feasible."}]
