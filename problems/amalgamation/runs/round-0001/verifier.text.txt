{"feedback_md":"High-level assessment\nBoth reports make solid progress by (i) recasting 4‑hypertournaments via an orientation function f:[V]^4→{±1}, (ii) reducing AP to one‑point amalgamation, and (iii) formulating the one‑point step for |A|=4 as a finite CSP with six cross variables and four 5‑set constraints. This is the right reduction and gives an auditable path to a definitive decision.\n\nCorrections and rigor audit\n- Orientation function model (Prover 02, Lemma 1): Correct. For each 4‑set S, choosing one parity class determines R on S and choices across different S are independent. This is the cleanest formalism and we adopt it.\n- One‑point amalgamation suffices for AP (both): Correct. The iterative addition of vertices c1,…,ck to B preserves H because at step i every 5‑set involving ci is controlled by the one‑point amalgamation at that step, including those with previously added vertices (they lie in the current base Ai).\n- CSP formulation for |A|=4 (both): Correct. The only unknown f‑values are on the six cross 4‑sets X_{ij}={i,j,b,c}, and the only new 5‑sets are Y_k={b,c}∪(A\\{k}). Each Y_k depends on three variables and two fixed bits p^B_k, p^C_k.\n- Misstatement about “switching” (Prover 01): The claim “switching preserves being O5 vs non‑O5” for a fixed 5‑set is false. Example: for p=(+,-,-,-,-) (an O5 representative), switching at the vertex corresponding to the unique ‘+’ flips the other four coordinates, yielding (+,+,+,+,+) (a C5 representative). So switching changes the local 5‑type; it does not preserve O5/non‑O5 on a fixed 5‑set. It does preserve the 4‑hypertournament axioms globally.\n- Representatives and sign conventions: The two reports choose different canonical 5‑vectors for C5/H5/O5. That’s fine as long as Step A computes the full S5‑orbit of O5 under the correct action p↦(ε_i(τ)·p_{τ^{-1}(i)}) and tests membership invariantly. Do not rely on the raw count of “+” entries.\n- |A|≤2 one‑point step: Trivial and correct; no 5‑set constraints exist. |A|=3: Prover 01’s “<8” count of O5 among the 2^3 assignments is plausible but unproven here; we should settle it by the orbit computation (Step A) and a tiny enumeration.\n\nPromising directions and concrete next steps\n1) Implement Step A once and for all: compute the O5 orbit in {±1}^5 via p↦(ε_i(τ)·p_{τ^{-1}(i)}). Produce a function IsO5(p).\n2) One‑point, |A|=3: For each (α,β)∈{±1}^2, enumerate the 8 triples and count how many yield O5 for the unique 5‑set; record that at least one choice avoids O5. This will put the |A|=3 case on record.\n3) One‑point, |A|=4: Enumerate all compatible (B,C) up to relabeling of A (B and C of types C5 or H5, agreeing on f(A)). For each pair, solve the 6‑variable CSP by brute force using IsO5 on Y_k, k=1..4. Either find an unsatisfiable case (certifies AP fails) or certify satisfiability for all pairs (strong evidence toward AP).\n4) Precompute local constraint sets F(α,β)⊆{±1}^3: the allowed triples for a 5‑set given its two fixed coordinates. This collapses the |A|=4 CSP to four membership tests in precomputed sets and isolates the true obstruction structure.\n5) Optional constructive ansatz to test: x_{ij}=w_iw_j with w_i:=α(i)β(i) for i∈A. If it always passes, it yields a uniform construction for all |A|; otherwise the failing pattern will guide a counterexample.\n\nKey cautions\n- Do not use switching to enlarge allowed sets; it alters B and C as well as the 5‑types, so it is not a safe normalization for the fixed one‑point diagram.\n- Ensure the compatibility condition on the common 4‑set A is enforced when enumerating B and C.\n","new_notes_md":"Set‑up and notations (agreed baseline)\n- 4‑hypertournament on finite V: equivalent to a function f:[V]^4→{±1}. For an ordered 4‑tuple (x1,x2,x3,x4) with underlying set S, we declare (x1,x2,x3,x4)∈R iff the permutation from the increasing ordering of S to (x1,…,x4) has sign equal to f(S). This satisfies (i) tuples have distinct entries, (ii) closure under even permutations, (iii) exactly one of (x1,x2,x3,x4) and (x2,x1,x3,x4) lies in R.\n- For a 5‑set X, define its 5‑vector p(X)∈{±1}^X by p_x:=f(X\\{x}). Isomorphisms act by p↦(ε_i(τ)·p_{τ^{-1}(i)}) with ε_i(τ)=sign of τ restricted to X\\{τ^{-1}(i)}. The three isomorphism types on 5 points are denoted C5, H5, O5. For computation we may use representatives C5=(+,+,+,+,+), O5=(+,-,-,-,-), H5=(+,-,+,-,+); the orbit relation is determined by the above action (not by raw counts of pluses).\n\nOne‑point amalgamation reduction\n- AP for H (class of finite 4‑hypertournaments with no induced O5) reduces to the one‑point case: Given A∈H, B=A∪{b}∈H, C=A∪{c}∈H with B∩C=A, existence of D on A∪{b,c} in H extending B and C implies full AP by iteratively adding the vertices of C\\A to B.\n\nCSP for the minimal nontrivial one‑point case |A|=4\n- Fix A={1,2,3,4}, b=5, c=6. The only undetermined f‑values are the six cross 4‑sets X_{ij}={i,j,5,6} (1≤i<j≤4). Let variables x_{ij}:=f(X_{ij})∈{±1}.\n- The only potentially new 5‑sets are Y_k:={5,6}∪(A\\{k}) for k∈{1,2,3,4}. For each k, p(Y_k) has two fixed coordinates: p missing 6 equals p^B_k:=f_B({5}∪(A\\{k})), and p missing 5 equals p^C_k:=f_C({6}∪(A\\{k})); and three variable coordinates drawn from {x_{ij}} on the three pairs inside A\\{k}:\n  • Y_1 depends on {x_{23},x_{24},x_{34}}\n  • Y_2 depends on {x_{13},x_{14},x_{34}}\n  • Y_3 depends on {x_{12},x_{14},x_{24}}\n  • Y_4 depends on {x_{12},x_{13},x_{23}}.\n- Constraint: For each k, p(Y_k) must not lie in the O5‑orbit. This is the complete constraint system for the one‑point amalgam over A of size 4.\n\nBase sizes |A|≤2 and |A|=3\n- |A|≤2: There are no 5‑sets Y; any assignment to cross 4‑sets works, so one‑point amalgamation always succeeds.\n- |A|=3: There is exactly one 5‑set Y=A∪{b,c}, with two fixed coordinates (those missing b and c) and three unknowns (those missing each a∈A). We expect (and plan to verify computationally) that for every (α,β)∈{±1}^2 at least one of the 8 assignments to the three unknowns avoids the O5 orbit. This settles one‑point amalgamation at size 3 once verified.\n\nSwitching: what it does and what it does not\n- For ε:V→{±1}, define f^ε(S):=(∏_{v∈S}ε(v))·f(S). Then f^ε encodes another 4‑hypertournament.\n- Caution: For a fixed 5‑set X, switching at a vertex v∈X flips the four coordinates of p(X) corresponding to the 4‑sets that contain v and leaves the coordinate “missing v” unchanged. This can change the 5‑type: e.g., (+,-,-,-,-) (an O5 representative) switches at the ‘+’ vertex to (+,+,+,+,+) (a C5 representative). Thus switching is not a valid normalization trick for fixed one‑point data (B,C) in H.\n\nComputational plan (to settle |A|=3 and |A|=4)\n- Step A: Compute the O5 orbit via the S5 action above; implement IsO5(p).\n- Step B (|A|=3): For each (α,β), enumerate the 8 triples, test IsO5, and record that at least one choice avoids O5.\n- Step C (|A|=4): Enumerate compatible (B,C) (both of type C5 or H5, agreeing on f(A)), form p^B_k,p^C_k (k=1..4), and brute‑force the 2^6 choices of x_{ij}, rejecting any assignment for which some Y_k is O5. Record either a counterexample or certify all cases pass.\n- Precompute F(α,β)⊆{±1}^3: the allowed triples for a 5‑set with given two fixed coordinates. Then the |A|=4 CSP checks membership of the four triangle‑triples in F(p^B_k,p^C_k).\n\nConstructive ansatz to test\n- Try x_{ij}=w_iw_j with w_i:=p^B_i·p^C_i for i∈A. For T={i,j,k} this gives a triple (w_iw_j,w_iw_k,w_jw_k) of product +1. If this never yields O5 for any (p^B_k,p^C_k), it provides a uniform construction for all |A| (worth testing; not proved).","new_notes_append":"True","new_outputs_md":"Proposition 1 (Orientation function model).\nFor a finite set V, giving a 4‑hypertournament structure (V,R) satisfying: (i) all tuples in R have distinct entries; (ii) R is closed under even permutations of coordinates; (iii) for every 4‑tuple of distinct vertices (x1,x2,x3,x4), exactly one of (x1,x2,x3,x4) and (x2,x1,x3,x4) lies in R; is equivalent to giving an arbitrary function f:[V]^4→{±1}.\nProof. Given f, declare (x1,x2,x3,x4)∈R iff the permutation from the increasing ordering of S={x1,x2,x3,x4} to (x1,…,x4) has sign equal to f(S). This satisfies (i)–(iii) by construction. Conversely, given R with (i)–(iii), fix any 4‑set S and any increasing ordering s of S. By (iii), exactly one of s and its swap lies in R; define f(S)=+1 if s∈R and f(S)=−1 otherwise. By (ii) and (iii), membership of any ordered tuple from S depends only on the parity relative to s, so f is well defined and recovers R. ∎\n\nLemma 2 (One‑point amalgamation suffices for AP in H).\nLet H be the class of finite 4‑hypertournaments omitting O5. Suppose that whenever A∈H and B=A∪{b}∈H and C=A∪{c}∈H with B∩C=A, there exists D∈H on A∪{b,c} extending both B and C. Then H has the amalgamation property.\nProof. Given B0,B1∈H over A, enumerate C\\A as c1,…,ck and set A0:=A. Inductively, amalgamate Bi with Ai∪{ci} over Ai to obtain Bi+1 on Ai+1:=Ai∪{ci}. At each step, by hypothesis, all 5‑sets involving the new vertex ci avoid O5, and previously constructed parts are unchanged. After k steps we obtain an amalgam D∈H of B0 and C over A. ∎\n\nProposition 3 (CSP formulation of the |A|=4 one‑point step).\nLet A={1,2,3,4}, b, c new. Given B on A∪{b} and C on A∪{c} in H that agree on A, any amalgam D on A∪{b,c} is determined on new 4‑sets by the six values x_{ij}:=f({i,j,b,c}) (1≤i<j≤4). The only new 5‑sets are Y_k:={b,c}∪(A\\{k}) for k=1,2,3,4. Writing p^B_k:=f_B({b}∪(A\\{k})) and p^C_k:=f_C({c}∪(A\\{k})), the 5‑vector p(Y_k) has two fixed coordinates (missing c gives p^B_k; missing b gives p^C_k) and three coordinates equal to the x_{ij} for {i,j}⊂A\\{k}. D∈H iff for each k, p(Y_k) is not in the O5 orbit.\nProof. All 4‑sets contained in B or C are already fixed. The only 4‑sets not contained in B or C are precisely the six X_{ij}={i,j,b,c}. The only new 5‑subsets of A∪{b,c} (relative to B and C) are those that contain both b and c; there are exactly four, the Y_k. Their p‑vectors depend on the listed values. Avoidance of O5 on all 5‑sets is thus equivalent to the stated four constraints. ∎\n\nCorollary 4 (Trivial one‑point cases |A|≤2).\nIf |A|≤2, then one‑point amalgamation always succeeds in H.\nProof. When |A|≤2 there are no 3‑subsets of A, hence no 5‑sets of the form {b,c}∪T with T⊂A of size 3. Thus there are no new 5‑set constraints; any assignment to cross 4‑sets yields an amalgam in H. ∎\n\nFact 5 (Switching yields a 4‑hypertournament but may change 5‑types).\nFor ε:V→{±1}, define f^ε(S):=(∏_{v∈S}ε(v))·f(S). Then f^ε encodes a 4‑hypertournament. However, for a fixed 5‑set X, switching at v∈X flips the four coordinates of p(X) corresponding to 4‑sets containing v and leaves the coordinate “missing v” unchanged; this can change the isomorphism type on X (e.g., an O5 representative (+,-,-,-,-) switches at its ‘+’ vertex to (+,+,+,+,+), a C5 representative). ∎","new_outputs_append":"True","verdict":"uncertain"}
