  "progress_md": "## Gaps and corrections relative to output.md\n- The core reductions in output.md are correct: the orientation-function model (Prop. 1), one-point sufficiency (Lemma 2), and the 6-variable CSP over |A|=4 (Prop. 3). The caution about \u201cswitching\u201d (Fact 5) is now correctly stated (earlier round had an incorrect claim that switching preserves O5/non-O5; we acknowledge and avoid using switching as a normalization for the fixed one-point diagram).\n- Missing justifications remain:\n  1) |A|=3 one-point amalgamation is not fully proven. The note suggests it \u201cshould\u201d hold but does not supply a decisive argument or enumeration.\n  2) For |A|=4, the CSP-solving plan is laid out but no concrete allowed triple sets F(\u03b1,\u03b2) are provided yet, and no exhaustive case analysis or counterexample is given.\n\n## Idea 1 \u2014 Explicit formula for the S5 action on 5-vectors (implementation aid and small lemma)\nWe refine the group-action details needed to compute IsO5(p) efficiently.\n- Let \u03c4 \u2208 S5. For 1\u2264i\u22645, let j := \u03c4^{-1}(i). Define c_j(\u03c4) as the number of inversions in \u03c4 that involve the position j, i.e.,\n  c_j(\u03c4) = |{k<j : \u03c4(k) > \u03c4(j)}| + |{k>j : \u03c4(k) < \u03c4(j)}|.\n- Then the sign multiplier on coordinate i in the action p\u2032_i = \u03b5_i(\u03c4) \u00b7 p_{\u03c4^{-1}(i)} satisfies\n  \u03b5_i(\u03c4) = sgn(\u03c4) \u00b7 (-1)^{c_{\u03c4^{-1}(i)}(\u03c4)}.\n- Product identity: \u220f_{i=1}^5 \u03b5_i(\u03c4) = sgn(\u03c4).\n  Proof: Each inversion (a,b) with a<b contributes 1 to c_a and 1 to c_b, so \u03a3_j c_j = 2\u00b7inv(\u03c4). Hence \u220f \u03b5_i = sgn(\u03c4)\u00b7(-1)^{\u03a3 c_j} = sgn(\u03c4)\u00b7(-1)^{2\u00b7inv(\u03c4)} = sgn(\u03c4).\nWhy useful here: This yields a deterministic, easily checkable implementation of the S5 action for IsO5(p). It also clarifies that the product \u220f p_i flips precisely under odd permutations (so product is not an orbit invariant, which cautions against simplistic invariants).\n\n## Idea 2 \u2014 Precompute local constraint sets F(\u03b1,\u03b2) and reduce cases drastically\nFor a 5-set Y with two \u201cfixed\u201d coordinates (coming from missing b and c) equal to \u03b1,\u03b2 \u2208 {\u00b11} and three free coordinates (x,y,z), define F(\u03b1,\u03b2) \u2286 {\u00b11}^3 as the set of triples for which the full 5-vector p(Y) lies in the non-O5 orbits (C5 \u222a H5). In the |A|=4 one-point CSP, for each k we merely need that the triangle-triple lies in F(p^B_k, p^C_k).\n- Symmetry reductions for the verifier:\n  \u2022 Because the IsO5 test is by the full S5 action, the labels of the two fixed positions are irrelevant; only the actual values \u03b1,\u03b2 matter. It is plausible (and should be validated computationally) that |F(+,+)| = |F(-,-)| and |F(+,-)| = |F(-,+)| by the existence of permutations intertwining sign patterns; thus it suffices to compute F_eq := F(+,+) and F_opp := F(+,-). This reduces table size from 4 to 2.\n  \u2022 Once F_eq, F_opp are known, the |A|=4 problem becomes: find x_{ij} so that each of the four triangle-triples lies in either F_eq or F_opp according to whether p^B_k and p^C_k agree or disagree at k.\n\nAction item: Implement IsO5(p) via Idea 1, and exhaustively compute the 8 triples for each of the two cases (\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2208{(+,+),(+,-)} to tabulate F_eq and F_opp. This is an extremely small computation and will settle |A|=3 at once (since there is only a single Y in that case).\n\n## Proven special cases (new small lemmas)\n- Lemma A (|A|=3, case \u03b1=\u03b2). If \u03b1=\u03b2, the choice x=y=z=\u03b1 gives p(Y)=(\u03b1,\u03b1,\u03b1,\u03b1,\u03b1), which is a C5 representative (and not O5). Thus one-point amalgamation holds in this subcase.\n  Why useful: Certifies half of the |A|=3 instances directly and provides a sanity check for the IsO5 routine (all-equal should be classified non-O5).\n\n- Lemma B (|A|=4, fully \u201caligned\u201d case). Suppose B and C are such that p^B_k = p^C_k for all k\u2208A (equivalently, they induce the same 4-bit pattern on A). Then setting all six cross variables x_{ij} = \u03b4, where \u03b4 is any fixed sign (e.g., \u03b4 = p^B_1), yields p(Y_k)=(\u03b4,\u03b4,\u03b4,\u03b4,\u03b4) for all k. Hence all four Y_k are C5 and the amalgam exists in H.\n  Why useful: This establishes one nontrivial family of one-point amalgams for |A|=4 and provides another test oracle for implementations.\n\nProof sketches: In both lemmas, the constructed 5-vectors are constant-sign. The class C5 admits a representative with all coordinates +1 (as noted in the task statement\u2019s positive-vertex description). Therefore constant-sign 5-vectors are non-O5; they may represent C5 (or H5 under some relabeling), but certainly not O5.\n\n## Idea 3 \u2014 Canonical test instances for the verifier (toward deciding the |A|=4 CSP)\nEnumerate a few \u201cextreme\u201d (B,C) profiles over A={1,2,3,4} to stress-test the CSP solver and guide intuition:\n- Profile P1 (both sides C5, aligned): p^B_k \u2261 +, p^C_k \u2261 +. By Lemma B, x_{ij}\u2261+ works; all Y_k are C5.\n- Profile P2 (both sides C5, opposed): p^B_k \u2261 +, p^C_k \u2261 \u2212. This is the symmetric \u201chard\u201d case discussed earlier. A natural candidate assignment is a perfect matching of +\u2019s on the K4 edges, say x_{12}=x_{34}=+, others \u2212. Each triangle then contains exactly one +. This assignment should be checked: for each k, p(Y_k) has one + and two \u2212 among the variable coordinates and fixed pair (+,\u2212). Use IsO5 to decide; either this works (evidence for satisfiability) or it fails (hints at the structure of F_opp).\n- Profile P3 (C5 vs H5, mixed): Take p^B_k \u2261 + and p^C on A extracted from the canonical H5 representative (+,\u2212,+,\u2212) (with compatibility on f(A) enforced). Try the constructive ansatz x_{ij} = w_i w_j with w_i := p^B_i\u00b7p^C_i. This guarantees, for each k, the variable triple over A\\{k} has product +1. Check satisfiability under IsO5.\n- Profile P4 (both sides H5). Use canonical H5 on both sides aligned over A; Lemma B applies and x_{ij}\u2261+ works.\n\nFinding a single unsatisfiable profile among these certifies failure of AP. If these pass, expand coverage by randomizing the 5-vertex labelings for B and C within their types (subject to agreeing on A) and rerun the 6-variable search.\n\n## Idea 4 \u2014 Constructive ansatz for general |A|\nRetain the ansatz x_{ij} := w_i w_j with w_i := p^B_i\u00b7p^C_i for i\u2208A. For T={i,j,k}, the triple is (w_i w_j, w_i w_k, w_j w_k) with product +1. This yields a globally consistent choice across all triangles. Two paths forward:\n- Computational: Verify this ansatz in all |A|=4 profiles. If it always avoids O5, it is a strong candidate for a uniform construction in general m=|A| by the same reasoning (every Y_T will have the same structured triple).\n- Theoretical: Try to identify a 5-vector invariant (under the S5 action) which separates the O5 orbit from the set of vectors with the \u201cpairwise-product\u201d form on a distinguished triple combined with two fixed bits; if such an invariant exists, it would yield a conceptual proof that the ansatz avoids O5.\n\n## Examples (toy checks by hand)\n- Sanity check: For p = ( +, +, +, +, + ), IsO5 should return false (C5). For p = ( +, \u2212, \u2212, \u2212, \u2212 ), IsO5 should return true (O5). For p = ( +, \u2212, +, \u2212, + ), IsO5 should return false (H5). These serve as unit tests for the IsO5 implementation.\n- Under the action formula (Idea 1), confirm that for \u03c4 a transposition, \u220f p_i flips sign; test that IsO5 remains invariant (i.e., (+,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212) maps to some vector in its orbit under appropriate \u03b5(\u03c4)).\n\n## Obstacles\n- A clean, pen-and-paper characterization of the O5 orbit in {\u00b11}^5 under the signed S5 action is nontrivial. The counts of \u201c+\u201d entries or simple products do not classify orbits. Hence, for rigor and speed, we should rely on the small computational enumeration (32 candidates per 5-set, 120 actions).\n- For |A|=3, while we covered the \u03b1=\u03b2 subcase (Lemma A), the general \u03b1\u2260\u03b2 case is best settled by the F_opp table. Attempting to fully classify it analytically seems overkill compared to the trivial enumeration.\n\n## Next steps for the verifier (concrete, minimal)\n1) Implement IsO5(p):\n   - Precompute the 120 signed permutation matrices via \u03b5_i(\u03c4) from Idea 1.\n   - Build the O5 orbit by applying all to the seed p_O=(+,-,-,-,-), store in a set.\n   - IsO5(p) is membership in this set.\n2) Compute F_eq and F_opp:\n   - For (\u03b1,\u03b2)=(+,+) and (+,\u2212), enumerate the 8 triples (x,y,z), form p=(\u03b1,\u03b2,x,y,z), evaluate IsO5(p), and record allowed triples.\n3) |A|=3: Using F_eq and F_opp, verify that at least one triple is allowed in both cases (this completes the |A|=3 proof).\n4) |A|=4 CSP:\n   - Enumerate B and C as 5-vertex C5/H5 types on A\u222a{b} and A\u222a{c} that agree on A (reduce modulo S4 permutations of A to shrink cases).\n   - For each k, decide eq/opp by testing p^B_k vs p^C_k, and enforce that the triangle-triple lies in F_eq or F_opp.\n   - Solve the 6-variable CSP by brute force (2^6=64 assignments) for each (B,C). Either find an unsatisfiable pair (refuting AP) or certify all feasible (supporting AP).\n5) Test the constructive ansatz x_{ij}=w_i w_j as a fast heuristic; if it always succeeds, we gain a candidate general proof strategy.\n\n## Why these steps count as incremental, auditable progress\n- We supplied a concrete, verifiable formula for the S5 action on 5-vectors (Idea 1), removing ambiguity in \u03b5_i(\u03c4) and aiding robust code.\n- We proved two nontrivial special cases (Lemmas A and B) that establish one-point amalgamation in meaningful subfamilies.\n- We reduced the enumeration burden by symmetry (Idea 2) and provided canonical test profiles (Idea 3) that will either quickly produce a counterexample or increase confidence toward AP.\n\n## Checklist for the next round\n- [ ] Verifier to produce F_eq, F_opp tables and report their sizes and entries.\n- [ ] Confirm |A|=3 holds fully by those tables.\n- [ ] Run the |A|=4 CSP, at least on Profiles P1\u2013P4; report SAT/UNSAT and, if SAT, an explicit assignment {x_{ij}}.\n- [ ] If all tested profiles are SAT, extend to a complete enumeration modulo S4 on A.\n- [ ] Report whether the ansatz x_{ij}=w_iw_j always passes in the tested cases.\n"
