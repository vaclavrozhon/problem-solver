If there is an outputs.md, please include it and I will audit it carefully.\n\nOutline of incremental progress in this round\n- I recast 4-hypertournaments as 2-colorings (\u00b1) of 4-subsets; induced substructures are just restrictions of this coloring.\n- I reduced the amalgamation question for H (the class of 4-hypertournaments with no induced O_5) to a one-point-over-one-point amalgamation problem. This concentrates all difficulty into analyzing 5-vertex mixed subconfigurations.\n- In the 1-point-over-1-point case with |A|=4, I expressed the mixed constraints as a 2-coloring problem on the 6 edges of K_4, with four triangle constraints (one for each choice of 3 out of the 4 vertices of A). This gives a precise finite combinatorial core that we can fully analyze next.\n- I exhibited an easy positive amalgamation in a basic case (B=C=C_5), and provided a parametric \u201cparity template\u201d for cross 4-sets that may be used more generally.\n- I laid out a concrete computational agenda to complete the classification of the local constraints per triangle (depending on the two internal signs from B and C) and then decide the satisfiability of the 6-variable system in all cases (C_5 vs H_5 types on each side). This is small enough to do by hand or quick enumeration.\n\n1) Recasting 4-hypertournaments as signings of 4-sets\nFor a finite set V, a 4-hypertournament structure R is equivalent to choosing, for each 4-element subset Q\u2286V, one of the two equivalence classes of orderings (even permutations preserve membership, odd flips). Thus we can encode R by a function s on [V]^4 with values in {+1,\u22121}: for each 4-set Q, fix its elements in increasing order in some global labeling of V, and set s(Q)=+1 if that ordered 4-tuple is in R and s(Q)=\u22121 otherwise. The induced substructure on U\u2286V is the restriction of s to [U]^4.\n\nOn a 5-element set P, the induced structure is determined by the 5 signs s(P\\{i}), i\u2208P. Up to isomorphism, there are exactly three types (C_5, O_5, H_5), as in the task statement.\n\n2) The class H and the amalgamation problem\nH consists of all finite 4-hypertournaments with no induced O_5 on any 5-element subset. Given embeddings A\u2264B and A\u2264C with B\u2229C=A, the question is whether there exists D\u2208H with induced copies of B and C over A (i.e., an amalgam in H).\n\n3) Reduction to one-point-over-one-point amalgamation\nLemma 3.1 (standard reduction). H has AP if and only if the following 1-point extension amalgamation property holds: For every A\u2208H, every one-point extensions B=A\u222a{b}\u2208H and C=A\u222a{c}\u2208H over A, there exists D=A\u222a{b,c}\u2208H that simultaneously extends B and C.\n\nSketch proof: The \u201conly if\u201d direction is immediate. For \u201cif\u201d: enumerate the vertices of C\\A as c_1,\u2026,c_m and add them to B one by one. At the k-th step, apply the 1-point amalgamation over the current base A_k (which contains A together with previously amalgamated c_1,\u2026,c_{k\u22121}) to add c_k, preserving all previously decided orientations. Since everything is relational and we never identify new points, a standard back-and-forth (or induction) yields an amalgam D of B and C. This is the usual reduction of AP to the 1-point extension property in relational languages.\n\nThus it suffices to analyze the case |B\\A|=|C\\A|=1, i.e., B=A\u222a{b}, C=A\u222a{c}.\n\n4) The core mixed constraints live on 5-sets with three points of A and b,c\nFix a global linear order on the universe and use it to define the signs s(\u00b7) as above. Write X=B\\A={b} and Y=C\\A={c}. For any 5-element subset P, let us classify whether it is \u201cmixed\u201d (uses points from both sides) and whether its 4-subsets are already assigned (internal) or to be assigned (cross):\n- If P\u2286B or P\u2286C, it is already O_5-free by hypothesis (since B,C\u2208H).\n- The genuinely mixed 5-sets are precisely the sets of the form P_{T} = T \u222a {b,c} where T\u2286A and |T|=3. For such P_T, among the five 4-subsets:\n  \u2022 The subset missing c is T\u222a{b}\u2286B (internal; its sign is already fixed in B).\n  \u2022 The subset missing b is T\u222a{c}\u2286C (internal; fixed in C).\n  \u2022 The remaining three 4-subsets are of the form {b,c}\u222a(T\\{a}) for a\u2208T; these are cross 4-sets and must be chosen in the amalgam.\nThus, for |A|=4 (the smallest base where mixed constraints occur), there are exactly four mixed 5-sets, namely P_r=(A\\{r})\u222a{b,c} for r\u2208A, and six cross 4-sets, namely Q_{ij}={b,c,i,j} for unordered pairs {i,j}\u2286A. Each P_r \u201csees\u201d exactly the three cross 4-sets Q_{ij} with i,j in A\\{r}.\n\nNotation 4.1. Let s^B(r) denote the sign of the internal 4-set (A\\{r})\u222a{b} in B, and s^C(r) the sign of (A\\{r})\u222a{c} in C. These are determined by the 5-vertex types of B on A\u222a{b} and of C on A\u222a{c} (they depend only on which vertex of A is omitted).\nLet x_{ij}\u2208{\u00b11} (for 1\u2264i<j\u22644) be the yet-to-be-chosen sign of the cross 4-set Q_{ij}={b,c,i,j}.\n\nThe amalgamation problem for |A|=4, |B\\A|=|C\\A|=1 is: choose x_{ij} so that for each r\u2208{1,2,3,4}, the 5-vertex configuration on P_r is not isomorphic to O_5. The data for P_r are exactly the 5 signs consisting of the two internal signs s^B(r), s^C(r) and the three cross signs x_{ij} with i,j\u2208A\\{r}.\n\nThis reduces the 1-point-over-1-point amalgamation to a finite 6-variable constraint satisfaction problem with four constraints (one per r), each forbidding that the 5-tuple of signs on P_r fall into the O_5 orbit.\n\n5) A basic positive amalgamation example\nClaim 5.1. If B|_{A\u222a{b}} and C|_{A\u222a{c}} are both of type C_5 and (in the global enumeration) s^B(r)=s^C(r)=\u22121 for all r\u2208A, then setting x_{ij}\u2261\u22121 for all {i,j} yields a valid amalgam D\u2208H.\n\nReason: For each r, the five signs on P_r are all \u22121. This 5-vector represents C_5 (by the task\u2019s convention), hence is O_5-free. Since every other 5-set is contained in B or C, the union is O_5-free.\n\nThis shows there is no inherent obstruction in the simplest symmetric case and illustrates the utility of the K_4 edge-signing view.\n\n6) A useful parity template for the cross signs\nA convenient way to produce globally consistent cross signs is to fix a map \u03bb: (A\u222a{b,c})\u2192{0,1} and set, for cross 4-sets,\n  x_{ij} = (\u03bb(i) \u2295 \u03bb(j) \u2295 \u03bb(b) \u2295 \u03bb(c)) \u2208 {0,1},\nthen interpret 0 as \u22121 and 1 as +1. A simple calculation shows that, for any triple {i,j,k}\u2286A,\n  x_{ij} \u2295 x_{ik} \u2295 x_{jk} = \u03bb(b) \u2295 \u03bb(c).\nThus, for each P_r with T=A\\{r}, the parity of the three cross signs depends only on whether b and c receive the same \u03bb or not. This parity-template does not on its own guarantee O_5-freeness, because the forbidden type depends on the two internal signs s^B(r), s^C(r) as well; but it gives a structured family of assignments that satisfy a uniform triangle-parity relation and often can be tuned by choosing \u03bb to avoid bad patterns uniformly.\n\n7) Finite decision procedure for |A|=4 (next-step agenda)\nTo settle AP, it suffices (by Lemma 3.1) to resolve the 1-point extension case, and for minimal nontrivial bases it suffices to analyze |A|=4. Here is a complete and finite plan:\n- Step 1: Enumerate the two possible 5-vertex types for B|_{A\u222a{b}} and C|_{A\u222a{c}} (C_5 and H_5) and record their internal-sign profiles (s^B(r))_{r\u2208A} and (s^C(r))_{r\u2208A}. For H_5, there are two canonical descriptions in the task: positives {1,3,5} or {2,4}; restricted to A={1,2,3,4}, these give (s^C(1),\u2026,s^C(4)) = (+,\u2212,+,\u2212) or (\u2212,+,\u2212,+) after translating +/\u2212 to \u00b11. For C_5, we may without loss use the profile (\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212); (by isomorphism/renaming, other descriptions are possible, but since A\u2019s labels are fixed by the embeddings, these two H_5 patterns are the essentially different restrictions to A to consider).\n- Step 2: For each choice of types (B_type, C_type)\u2208{C_5,H_5}^2 and each choice of H_5 restriction for C (and for B if chosen H_5), form the four constraints (one per r) that a 5-tuple with internal signs s^B(r), s^C(r) and cross signs x over the triangle A\\{r} must not be isomorphic to O_5. This is a property of 5 bits; in each case it defines a forbidden subset F_r \u2282 {\u00b11}^3 of the 3 cross signs, depending on (s^B(r), s^C(r)).\n- Step 3: Solve the 6-variable problem: find x_{ij}\u2208{\u00b11} such that for all r, the triple (x_{ij})_{i,j\u2208A\\{r}} \u2209 F_r. There are only 64 assignments to check per (B_type,C_type,pattern), and the set of pairs to check is small.\n- Step 4: If in all cases there exists a solution, the 1-point extension property holds; hence H has AP. Conversely, finding a single bad pair (B,C) with no solution disproves AP.\n\nRemarks supporting feasibility:\n- The constraints are local and small. Although \u201cisomorphic to O_5\u201d involves the S_5 action on the 5 signs (with some parity effects under relabeling), here the universe and its order are fixed, so we can determine F_r by a direct check: for each of the 8 possible triples of cross signs, combine with the two fixed internal signs and decide if the resulting 5-configuration is in the O_5 orbit. This is a finite table lookup (5! permutations to check per pattern, but using the even/odd behavior, this can be optimized; still, brute force is easy here).\n- As a plausibility check, we already have a working assignment for (B_type,C_type)=(C_5,C_5). It is also natural to try the parity template in \u00a76 in the mixed cases to see whether a single bit \u03bb(b)\u2295\u03bb(c) can steer all four triangles away from O_5 simultaneously.\n\n8) What would falsify AP (strategy for counterexample)\nIf AP fails, there must be a 1-point-over-1-point failure with |A|=4. Concretely, we must find s^B,s^C (each coming from either C_5 or H_5 on A\u222a{b} and A\u222a{c}) such that no choice of x_{ij} avoids O_5 on all P_r. The K_4 edge-signing model shows exactly what to look for: four triangle constraints on the six edge-signs that are jointly unsatisfiable. This is small enough that either a hand derivation (using parity arguments) or a short exhaustive check will settle it. A potential structural tool: if, for each r, the forbidden set F_r were a single triple-pattern (or at most two), then a simple counting/parity argument would often force the existence of a solution. So an unsatisfiable instance, if it exists, must exploit more rigid forbidden sets F_r.\n\n9) Concrete next actions I propose\n- I will tabulate, for each pair of internal signs (\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2208{\u00b11}^2, which of the 8 cross-triples produce O_5 (up to isomorphism) and hence determine F_{\u03b1,\u03b2}. That gives a 4-row table of forbidden-triples sets.\n- With that table, I will solve the 6-variable 4-constraint problem for all three pairings of types (C_5,C_5), (C_5,H_5), (H_5,H_5) (noting H_5 has two A-restriction patterns to check), thereby deciding AP.\n- If outputs.md already contains any such tables or a claimed answer, I will cross-check them against the above reduction. Please provide outputs.md if available.\n\nSummary\n- We have a clean reduction of AP in H to a small, explicit finite problem (6 variables, 4 local constraints) in the 1-point-over-1-point case with |A|=4.\n- We gave a working amalgam in a base case (both sides C_5) and a general parity template that often enforces uniform triangle-parity among cross 4-sets.\n- The remaining step is to enumerate the forbidden cross-triples F_{\u03b1,\u03b2} for each (\u03b1,\u03b2) of internal signs and solve the small constraint system. This will either deliver a uniform amalgamation procedure (and hence AP), or a concrete counterexample (and hence failure of AP).\n"
