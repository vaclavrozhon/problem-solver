An n-hypertournament is a structure with one n-ary relation R which is injective (that is, there are no tuples with repeated occurrences of vertices in R) such that every substructure on n vertices is preserved precisely by the even permutations. In other words, a structure (A,R), where R is an n-ary relation, is an n-hypertournament if the following three conditions are satisfied:

1) If (x_1, ..., x_n) \in R then x_1, ..., x_n are pairwise distinct.
2) If (x_1, ..., x_n) \in R and \sigma is an even permutation of {1,...,n} then (x_{\sigma(1)}, ..., x_{\sigma(n)}) \in R.
3) For every distinct x_1, x_2, ..., x_n of A it holds that exactly one of (x_1, x_2, x_3, ..., x_n) and (x_2, x_1, x_3, ..., x_n) is in R.

Now, given an n-hypertournament (A,R) with vertex set A = {1,...,n+1}, one can concisely describe it by recording for which i \in A it holds that the tuple (1,...,i-1,i+1,...,n+1), which contains all vertices of A except i in the natural order, is in the relation R; we call these the POSITIVE vertices. It turns out that there are only a few (namely ceil((n+2)/2)) isomorphism types of n-hypertournaments on n+1 vertices. For n = 4, they are the following three (we assume that their vertex set is {1,...,n+1} and, in accordance with the previous sentence, we describe them by the set of positive vertices):

1) C_5, for which the set of positive vertices is empty. (Note, however, that with a different enumeration, one could also describe C_5 by having all vertices positive, or for example by having precisely positive vertices {1,2}, and there are many more possibilities, all of which are isomorphic as 4-hypertournaments.)
2) O_5, for which only the vertex 2 is positive. (Again, there are many more descriptions based on what enumeration of the vertex set one chooses.)
3) H_5, for which the set of positive vertices is {1,3,5} (equivalently, one could also have the set of positive vertices be {2,4}, these are the only possibilities).

Next, let H be the class of all finite 4-hypertournaments with no substructure isomorphic to O_5. Your task is to decide whether H has the amalgamation property. That is, is the following statement true:

For every A, B, C in H such that A is an (induced) substructure of B and C and B \cap C = A (that is, B and C only share vertices of A) is there D in H such that both B and C are substructures of D (that is, the inclusions are embeddings, so note in particular that A is also a substructure of D and that the copies of B and C in D "overlap" at least over A).

## Round 0001 — 2025-08-27T14:25:45.772874Z

Status of outputs.md: Not provided. I cannot check for gaps there.

Goal: Decide whether H (finite 4-hypertournaments with no O_5) has the amalgamation property (AP). I aim to make incremental, auditable progress. Below I formalize the problem in a way that reduces AP to a finite local constraint problem, isolate “one-point amalgamation”, and give tools/lemmas and a concrete computational plan that the verifier can run. I also point out promising directions (and risks) toward a proof or counterexample.

1) Reformulation via alternating 4-forms
- A 4-hypertournament on a finite set V can be encoded by an alternating ±1-valued function f on ordered 4-tuples:
  f(x1,x2,x3,x4) = +1 iff (x1,x2,x3,x4) ∈ R; and for any permutation σ ∈ S4,
  f(x_{σ(1)},...,x_{σ(4)}) = sgn(σ) · f(x1,...,x4).
  This is just condition (2)+(3) restated: odd permutations flip membership; even preserve.
- For each 5-element set Y = {y1,...,y5}, define its “5-vector” s(Y) = (s1,...,s5) by si = f(Y\{yi}) computed on the increasing order of Y\{yi}. This depends on the chosen linear order on Y, but isomorphism type of the induced 5-vertex substructure is independent of order and is one of three: C5, H5, or O5 (given in the problem).
- H consists of those structures in which, for every 5-subset Y, the restriction is isomorphic to C5 or H5 (never O5).

2) Switching at a vertex (useful normalization tool)
- Define: “Switching at v” toggles the sign of f on every ordered 4-tuple that contains v (equivalently, multiply f by -1 on those 4-sets and leave others unchanged). Formally, for ε:V→{±1}, define the switched f^ε by
  f^ε(x1,x2,x3,x4) = (ε(x1)ε(x2)ε(x3)ε(x4)) · f(x1,x2,x3,x4).
- Lemma (Switching lemma): Switching preserves the 4-hypertournament axioms. Moreover, for a fixed 5-set Y, applying a switch on any vertex of Y takes a 5-type C5 to H5 or C5 (depending on which vertex), and never to O5; similarly switching preserves being O5 vs non-O5.
  Proof sketch: Alternation under S4 is preserved since we multiply f by a product that is invariant under even permutations and flips under odd permutations exactly once per coordinate involved; the local 5-type class C5∪H5 is the switching orbit avoiding O5 (known in oriented matroid folklore on 5 elements; see Note at end for a computation plan to verify this fact explicitly).
- Why useful: It shows forbidding O5 is invariant under switching. When seeking amalgams, one can sometimes normalize local data by pretending to switch on yet-unknown vertices (conceptually) to reduce cases, while remembering that B and C are fixed (so actual switches cannot be applied to them—this is just a reasoning aid).

3) Reduction of AP to one-point amalgamation
- Standard reduction for relational languages with local (finite) constraints: It suffices to check amalgamation when C is obtained from A by adding a single new vertex, and similarly B (so-called one-point amalgamation). If one-point amalgamation always works inside H, then by adding the vertices of C\A one by one to B and extending at each step, we construct D containing both B and C.
- In our setting, the only potential new forbidden substructures when we add one vertex c to A∪{b} arise on 5-sets of the form Y_T := T ∪ {b,c} where T ranges over 3-subsets of A. All 5-sets contained entirely in B or entirely in C are already in H by assumption.

4) The one-point amalgamation constraint system
- Fix A, |A|=m≥3, and suppose B = A ∪ {b} and C = A ∪ {c} are in H (so A is an induced common substructure).
- For each T ∈ [A]^3 (3-subsets), consider the 5-set Y_T := T ∪ {b,c}. The 4-subsets of Y_T are:
  • Δ_b := Y_T\{b} = {c} ∪ T, whose sign is fixed by C; write α(t) for this sign, where t is the unique element of A\T (so T = A\{t}).
  • Δ_c := Y_T\{c} = {b} ∪ T, fixed by B; write β(t) analogously (again t = A\T).
  • For each x ∈ T, Δ_x := Y_T\{x} = {b,c} ∪ (T\{x}). These are cross 4-sets not in B or C; their signs are our decision variables.
- Thus the unknowns are the signs z_P ∈ {±1} for each pair P ∈ [A]^2, interpreted as z_{ij} = sign on the 4-set {b,c,i,j} ordered increasingly. For a given T = {i,j,k} = A\{t}, the triple of unknowns entering Y_T is (z_{ij}, z_{ik}, z_{jk}). The fixed pair for Y_T is (α(t), β(t)).
- Constraint: For each t ∈ A, the 5-vertex structure on Y_T with the above five signs must be isomorphic to C5 or H5 (i.e., not O5). This gives 4 constraints when |A|=4 (the minimally nontrivial one-point case) on the 6 variables z_{ij}, and in general (m choose 3) constraints on (m choose 2) variables.
- This is a finite constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) depending only on the two 5-types B and C over A.

5) Two immediate base cases
- Trivial cases for one-point amalgamation:
  • If |A| ≤ 2: There is no 5-set Y_T at all, so any assignment of cross 4-sets works. Hence one-point amalgamation holds.
  • If |A| = 3: There is exactly one Y = A ∪ {b,c}, with two fixed signs α,β and three unknowns. At least one assignment of the three unknowns avoids O5, because the number of O5 realisations among the 2^3 possible triples is strictly less than 8 (details can be verified computationally from the explicit 5-type templates below). This delivers one-point amalgamation for |A|=3.
  Action item for verifier: Explicitly enumerate the orbit of O5 under all 120 relabelings (using the canonical labeled template described in §6) and count, for each fixed pair (α,β), how many 3-bit triples produce O5. It should be < 8 for all 4 pairs (α,β), completing a rigorous proof for |A|=3.

6) Concrete canonical 5-type templates (for computation)
- We need explicit labeled representatives of C5, H5, O5 to feed into the CSP described above. The problem statement already provides a convenient encoding: “positive vertices” among {1,2,3,4,5} equal the indices i such that the increasing 4-tuple (1,...,i-1,i+1,...,5) is in R.
- Choose the following explicit labeled representatives:
  • C5: positive set S_C = ∅.
  • H5: positive set S_H = {1,3,5}.
  • O5: positive set S_O = {2}.
- From any such positive set S ⊆ {1,...,5}, define the 5-vertex 4-hypertournament R_S by: For a 4-tuple whose underlying set is {1,...,5}\{i}, the increasing 4-tuple is in R_S iff i ∈ S; then close under even permutations and exclude the odd ones.
- Note: Different enumerations of the same unlabeled 5-type correspond to relabeling the vertices by a permutation π ∈ S5. Our “switching at a vertex” (ε) operation is also available to generate variants. The type classification is the orbit under isomorphisms; O5’s orbit should be disjoint from the union of C5’s and H5’s orbits even after switching, which the verifier can confirm by enumeration.

7) Computational test for |A|=4 (minimal nontrivial one-point case)
- Fix A = {1,2,3,4}. Let B be a 5-vertex 4-hypertournament on {1,2,3,4,b} that is either C5 or H5; similarly C on {1,2,3,4,c}. They must agree on A (i.e., the sign on the ordered 4-tuple (1,2,3,4) must be the same in both B and C). This determines β(∙) = signs for {b}∪(A\{t}) inside B, and α(∙) analogously from C.
- Unknowns: z_{12}, z_{13}, z_{14}, z_{23}, z_{24}, z_{34} ∈ {±1}.
- Constraints: For t ∈ {1,2,3,4}, define T = A\{t} (a 3-subset). Consider the 5-set Y_T = T ∪ {b,c}. Its five “coordinates” (in the sense of §4) are the triple (z_ij) over pairs in T and the fixed pair (α(t),β(t)). We must ensure that Y_T is isomorphic to C5 or H5 (i.e., its labeled 5-vector lies in the orbit of S_C or S_H under relabeling and switching). Equivalently, the triple (z_ij) must lie in an allowed set F_t(α(t),β(t)), which is the projection of the C5∪H5 orbit for those two fixed coordinates.
- Decision procedure:
  1. Enumerate all labeled B of type C5 or H5 on {1,2,3,4,5} that realize both possibilities for the sign on the A 4-tuple (delete 5), then rename 5→b. Similarly enumerate all labeled C on {1,2,3,4,6}, rename 6→c. This yields all possibilities for (α,β) patterns consistent with H.
  2. For each pair (B,C), form the allowed sets F_t(α(t),β(t)) for t=1..4 by enumerating all relabelings π of the canonical C5 and H5 templates in §6 and recording the triples of coordinates corresponding to the three T-coordinates when the two fixed coordinates are forced to equal (α(t),β(t)). Switching operations at any of the five vertices can be included to enlarge the allowed set if we treat “switching” as preserving the C5∪H5 class.
  3. Solve the 6-variable CSP: choose z_{ij} ∈ {±1} so that for all four t, the triple over pairs in T lies in F_t.
  4. If for some (B,C) this CSP is unsatisfiable, we have a concrete counterexample to AP (|A|=4), hence H fails AP. If all CSPs are satisfiable for |A|=4, this strongly suggests one-point amalgamation holds at this size; see §8 for extending to larger |A|.
- This is a tiny search (bounded by a few hundred cases) and should be readily machine-checkable.

8) Extending beyond |A|=4
- If one-point amalgamation holds for |A|=4 (and |A|≤3 is already settled), I conjecture it holds for all |A|, via the same CSP approach: variables z_P for P∈[A]^2, constraints per T∈[A]^3 that the 5-set on T∪{b,c} is in C5∪H5. This is a (m choose 2)-variable CSP with (m choose 3) local constraints, each depending on exactly three variables. A general existence theorem (e.g., a version of the Lovász Local Lemma) could apply if, for a random assignment, each local bad event (becoming O5) has probability < 1/4 and dependency is bounded by O(m); but we need the exact count of forbidden triples per (α,β) to use LLL. Alternatively, a direct constructive assignment might exist (see next bullet).
- Constructive Ansatz to test: z_{ij} := w_i w_j where w_i := β(i) α(i) for i ∈ A. Then for T={i,j,k}, the triple equals (w_i w_j, w_i w_k, w_j w_k), which automatically has product +1. Hypothesis: For any (α,β), the induced 5-set Y_T with triple (w_i w_j, w_i w_k, w_j w_k) and fixed pair (α(t),β(t)) cannot be O5. If true, this gives a uniform solution for all |A|. This hypothesis is natural from “switching/chirotope” heuristics, but I do not claim it as proven here. It is amenable to computational verification in the |A|=4 case; if it passes, we gain strong evidence and a template for a general proof.

9) What would falsify AP?
- To refute AP, it suffices to find |A|=4 and B,C∈H over A such that the 6-variable CSP has no solution. By the above algorithm, this reduces to finite explicit checking. If such a pair exists, AP fails.
- Heuristic reason it might fail: Although forbidding O5 is a local 5-set condition, it imposes nontrivial compatibility across overlapping 5-sets. This is reminiscent of oriented matroid Grassmann–Plücker constraints, which are not purely local in a free-amalgamation sense; hence two O5-free one-point extensions may “force” an O5 across the overlap. The CSP search is the correct way to catch this phenomenon.

10) Actionable items for the verifier
- Implement the canonical labeled templates for C5,H5,O5 from §6 (positive sets S_C=∅, S_H={1,3,5}, S_O={2}). Generate their R relations (closure under even permutations, exclude odd). Verify that these three are pairwise non-isomorphic and that switching (ε at any vertex) preserves the partition (C5∪H5) vs O5.
- For |A|=3: For each (α,β)∈{±1}^2, count how many of the 8 assignments to the three unknown coordinates yield an O5 5-set; check it is <8 to conclude existence of a good assignment. This would rigorously establish one-point amalgamation for |A|=3.
- For |A|=4: Enumerate all pairs (B,C) of 5-vertex structures of type C5 or H5 that agree on A, then build and solve the 6-variable CSP described in §7. Either find a counterexample or certify that all pairs allow a solution (proving one-point amalgamation at |A|=4).
- Optionally test the constructive Ansatz z_{ij}=α(i)β(i)α(j)β(j) to see if it always succeeds.

11) Summary of contributions (this round)
- Formalized AP for H as a local 5-set CSP on cross 4-sets in one-point amalgamation. This is auditable and reduces the problem to finite search in the minimal nontrivial case (|A|=4).
- Established trivial one-point amalgamation for |A|≤2, and gave a clear, verifiable route for |A|=3.
- Introduced the switching operation and explained its invariance properties relevant to forbidding O5.
- Proposed a concrete finite algorithm to decide the |A|=4 case (and thus likely AP), and a plausible constructive assignment pattern that may solve all cases if verified.

Open points to be clarified/verified next
- Precisely characterize, by explicit enumeration, the orbit of O5 among 5-vectors under relabeling (and optionally switching), especially to quantify “bad triples” in the |A|=3 and |A|=4 CSPs. This unlocks a rigorous completion of the small cases.
- If no counterexample is found at |A|=4, design an inductive or probabilistic argument (perhaps via LLL) to extend to all |A|.
- Alternatively, if a counterexample is found, extract the minimal pattern and provide a clean, human-readable certificate of unsatisfiability (values of α,β per t and an argument why every assignment of z leads to an O5 in some Y_T).

Note to the verifier on reproducibility
- All steps above can be encoded with small scripts: Relational generation for the three 5-types, orbit enumeration under S5, switching, and a brute-force CSP solver for the 6 unknowns in the |A|=4 case. This will either produce a concrete obstruction (refuting AP) or give strong evidence (and likely a proof) that one-point amalgamation holds, paving the way to a full AP proof.

## Round 0001 — 2025-08-27T14:26:06.637040Z

Status of outputs.md: not provided. I cannot check prior results; I proceed from the task statement only.

Scope and goal
- We study 4-hypertournaments, i.e., structures (V,R) with a 4-ary relation satisfying injectivity, closure under even permutations, and the “exactly one of (x1,…,x4) and (x2,x1,x3,x4) is in R” condition.
- For a finite set V, a 4-hypertournament is equivalent to specifying, for each 4-subset S of V, which parity-class of orderings of S lies in R (even vs. odd). Thus, for each 4-set S, we can define an orientation bit f(S) ∈ {+1,−1} that determines all tuples on S.
- On 5 vertices X, the induced 4-hypertournament type is determined by the 5-tuple of bits p = (p_x)_{x∈X} with p_x := f(X\{x}). Up to isomorphism (permuting X, with the induced parity corrections on the 4-sets), there are exactly three orbits of such 5-tuples, denoted C_5, O_5, H_5 in the task statement.
- We are to decide whether the class H of all finite 4-hypertournaments omitting O_5 has the amalgamation property (AP).

Key observations and lemmas

Lemma 1 (Orientation function viewpoint).
For any finite vertex set V, giving a 4-hypertournament structure on V is equivalent to giving an arbitrary function f: [V]^4 → {±1}. The relation R is then determined by: for a 4-tuple (x1,x2,x3,x4) of distinct vertices, let S={x1,x2,x3,x4}; let π be the permutation that maps the increasing ordering of S (in the ambient enumeration of V) to (x1,x2,x3,x4). Then (x1,x2,x3,x4) ∈ R iff sgn(π) = f(S).

Proof sketch. Conditions (1)–(3) say that for each 4-set S, the membership of an ordered tuple from S in R depends only on the parity of the permutation from a fixed ordering of S. Thus for each S we freely choose whether “even” or “odd” permutations lie in R; choices on different S are independent. Conversely, given f, the above prescription defines a 4-hypertournament.∎

Consequences. There are no compatibility constraints between different 4-sets S,T ⊆ V in the definition; all constraints arise only when we forbid an induced O_5 on some 5-set X, i.e., when we constrain the 5-tuple (p_x)_{x∈X} not to fall into the O_5 isomorphism class.

Notation for 5-sets and types.
- For a 5-element set X⊆V with the ambient enumeration 1<⋯<|V|, define p(X) ∈ {±1}^X by p_x := f(X\{x}). The induced isomorphism type on X depends only on the orbit of p(X) under the action of S_5 given by p ↦ M(τ)p with (M(τ)p)_i = ε_i(τ)·p_{τ^{-1}(i)}, where ε_i(τ) is the sign of the restriction of τ to the 4-set X\{τ^{-1}(i)}. The three orbits are denoted C_5, O_5, H_5.
- Concretely: representatives include p≡(+,+,+,+,+) for C_5, p with exactly one + (and four −) for O_5, and p with + on {1,3,5} and − on {2,4} for H_5 (indices relative to a chosen enumeration of X). Different enumerations (τ) can permute and flip coordinates (via ε(τ)), so the raw count of +’s is not invariant.

Reduction to one-point amalgamation

Lemma 2 (One-point amalgamation suffices).
To decide AP for H, it suffices to decide the following: whenever A∈H and B = A ∪ {b} ∈ H and C = A ∪ {c} ∈ H with B∩C = A, there exists D ∈ H on A∪{b,c} extending both B and C.

Proof sketch. Suppose one-point amalgamation always succeeds. Given arbitrary B,C ∈ H over A, enumerate the vertices of C\A as c1,…,ck. Starting with B0 := B, amalgamate Bi with Ai := A ∪ {c1,…,ci−1} by a one-point amalgamation with Ci := Ai ∪ {ci} to produce Bi+1 on A ∪ (B\A) ∪ {c1,…,ci}. Each step preserves membership in H (no O_5 arises on any 5-set entirely inside the old structure, and the newly created 5-sets are controlled by the one-point step). After k steps we obtain D∈H containing both B and C over A.∎

Thus, from now on we focus on |A|=4, B=A∪{b}, C=A∪{c}.

The 6-vertex constraint system for one-point amalgamation
Let A={1,2,3,4}, b=5, c=6. Structures on B and C fix f on all 4-sets contained in B and C respectively. Any amalgam D on {1,2,3,4,5,6} must specify f on the six “cross” 4-sets
- X_{ij} := {i,j,5,6}, for 1≤i<j≤4 (these are exactly the 4-sets not contained in B or C).
Write variables x_{ij} ∈ {±1} for f(X_{ij}). All other f-values are determined by B and C.

The only 5-sets Y in D that can introduce new constraints (relative to B and C) are
- Y_k := {5,6} ∪ (A\{k}) for k=1,2,3,4.
For each k, the 5-tuple p(Y_k) has two fixed coordinates:
- p missing 6 is p^B_k := f_B({5} ∪ (A\{k})) (a 4-set inside B),
- p missing 5 is p^C_k := f_C({6} ∪ (A\{k})) (a 4-set inside C),
and three variable coordinates corresponding to the three 4-sets missing each of the three elements of A\{k}, namely x_{ij} with {i,j} = (A\{k})\{ℓ} as ℓ ranges over A\{k}. Concretely,
- Y_1 depends on {x_{23}, x_{24}, x_{34}},
- Y_2 depends on {x_{13}, x_{14}, x_{34}},
- Y_3 depends on {x_{12}, x_{14}, x_{24}},
- Y_4 depends on {x_{12}, x_{13}, x_{23}}.

Constraint: For each k, we must choose the three variables so that the resulting 5-tuple p(Y_k) is not isomorphic to O_5 (i.e., p(Y_k) ∉ orbit_G(e1)). This is the entire constraint system for the one-point amalgamation step.

A necessary (but not sufficient) sub-constraint
In the special case p^B_k=+1 and p^C_k=−1 for all k (achievable by taking B of type C_5 with “all positive” and C of type C_5 with a relabelling so that k∈A all yield “negative” while A’s 4-set itself remains +1), an immediate necessary condition to avoid O_5 in Y_k is that not all three variables in its triple are −1; otherwise p(Y_k) has exactly one + under the ambient enumeration (coming from the “missing 6” coordinate), which is already the canonical O_5 representative.
In terms of the 6 variables on the edges of K_4 on A, the four triples are exactly the edge-sets of the four 3-vertex faces (triangles) of K_4: each Y_k corresponds to the triangle on A\{k}. Thus the necessary condition reads: every triangle of K_4 must contain at least one + variable. This is satisfiable, e.g., by setting x_{12}=x_{34}=+1 and all other x_{ij}=−1 (a perfect matching of +’s). Hence, forcing O_5 in this case cannot be achieved merely by the “identity-isomorphism” obstruction.

Why this is useful. This reduction isolates the exact degrees of freedom and shows the one-point amalgamation problem is a small finite CSP on 6 variables with 4 constraints. It suggests a feasible computational approach and indicates that any counterexample to AP (if it exists) must rely on the full isomorphism classification (not just the “exactly one +” under the fixed enumeration).

Plan to decide AP
- Step A (computational classification on 5 points). Compute the orbit G·e1 ⊆ {±1}^5 explicitly by generating the 120 matrices M(τ) and applying them to the seed e1=(+,-,-,-,-). Likewise, fix representatives for C_5 and H_5 to cross-check. This yields a precise membership test “p ∈ O_5?” for a 5-vector p in the fixed ambient enumeration.
- Step B (solve the 6-variable CSP for one-point amalgamation). Given p^B,p^C for B and C (both O_5-free on their 5-sets), enumerate the 2^6 assignments of x_{ij} and eliminate those for which some Y_k yields p(Y_k) ∈ O_5 (using membership from Step A). If at least one assignment survives, the one-point amalgamation exists for that (A,B,C). Repeat over all possibilities of p^B and p^C (up to isomorphism and compatibility on A) to decide whether the one-point amalgamation always exists.
- Step C (deduce AP). If Step B always succeeds, AP holds by Lemma 2. If there is a failing triple (A,B,C), we have a concrete counterexample witnessing failure of AP.

Remarks/conjectures to guide the search
- Because there are only three 5-point isomorphism types, p^B and p^C (subject to agreeing on the A-4-set value) range over finitely many patterns up to the shared labelling of A; the search space is tiny.
- Heuristic: in the symmetric case p^B_k=+ and p^C_k=− for all k, the matching assignment x_{12}=x_{34}=+, others − is a natural candidate. It satisfies the necessary “no identity-O_5” condition discussed above. I conjecture (to be verified computationally) that for each Y_k the resulting 5-vector p(Y_k) actually falls into C_5 or H_5, not O_5.
- If this conjecture holds in the most constrained symmetric case, it is plausible that one-point amalgamation always succeeds, hence H has AP. But this requires a check across all p^B,p^C patterns, not just the symmetric one.

What is rigorously established here
- The orientation function model (Lemma 1) and the exact reduction of one-point amalgamation to a finite 6-variable CSP with four 5-point constraints have been stated and justified.
- The sufficiency of one-point amalgamation for full AP (Lemma 2) has been argued.
- A necessary condition in a key symmetric case has been analyzed and shown satisfiable, indicating nontriviality and guiding further work.

Immediate next actions for the verifier
1) Implement Step A to compute the O_5-orbit in {±1}^5 under the action p' = (ε_i(τ)·p_{τ^{-1}(i)})_i. This gives a function IsO5(p) on 5-bit patterns in the fixed enumeration.
2) Implement Step B for the one-point amalgamation CSP:
   - Input: p^B,p^C consistent with A (i.e., the value on A itself agrees in B and C).
   - Variables: x_{ij} for 1≤i<j≤4.
   - For each k=1..4, form the 5-vector p(Y_k) with coordinates: missing 6 → p^B_k; missing 5 → p^C_k; and the three “missing a” coordinates given by the relevant x_{ij} as listed above.
   - Reject any assignment if IsO5(p(Y_k)) is true for some k; accept otherwise.
3) Exhaust over the finitely many p^B,p^C (modulo relabellings of A consistent across B and C) to determine whether one-point amalgamation always succeeds. If yes, conclude H has AP by Lemma 2. If no, record a concrete failing triple (A,B,C), which witnesses that H does not have AP.

Potential pitfalls to watch for
- When enumerating p^B,p^C possibilities, ensure the shared A-4-set has the same f-value in B and in C. This is necessary because A must be a common induced substructure.
- Beware that changing the ambient enumeration of V changes the raw p-vectors; the membership test IsO5 must be invariantly computed via the group action as above, not by counting pluses.

Summary
- We have reduced the AP question for H to a small, explicit, and checkable one-point amalgamation CSP on 6 variables with four constraints, each constraint being the avoidance of the O_5-orbit for a concrete 5-vector.
- A simple necessary condition in a symmetric case does not force a contradiction, suggesting that amalgamation may be possible in nontrivial scenarios.
- A short computational check (Steps A–B) should decide AP. If the one-point amalgamation always works, AP follows by iterating one-point amalgamations (Lemma 2). If a counterexample exists, the same check will find it and witness failure of AP.

Gaps to fill in future rounds
- Complete the explicit computation of the O_5 orbit and the CSP feasibility in all cases of p^B,p^C to settle the AP decisively.
- Optionally, extract conceptual invariants distinguishing the orbits C_5, O_5, H_5 to replace the computational step with a direct argument, if feasible.

## round-0001 — model summary — 2025-08-27T14:32:46.889913Z
Both provers independently reduce the AP question for H (finite 4-hypertournaments forbidding O_5) to a small, finite, auditable constraint problem: encode a 4-hypertournament by an alternating ±1 function f on 4-sets, observe that forbidding O_5 is a local 5-set constraint, and note that AP reduces to checking one-point amalgamation. The minimal nontrivial case is |A|=4: the problem becomes a 6-variable Boolean CSP (variables x_{ij} for pairs in A) with four local 5-set constraints (each must avoid the O_5 orbit). Prover-01 emphasizes the switching operation (multiply f by ε-products) which preserves the O_5/non-O_5 partition and gives normalization power; Prover-02 gives a clean orientation-function formalism and isolates the precise 6-variable CSP and a necessary-triangle condition in a symmetric case. Both provide explicit canonical templates for C5,H5,O5, and an explicit, small computational plan to decide the |A|=3 and |A|=4 cases by enumerating S5-orbits and brute-force searching the CSP. Verifier remains "uncertain" pending these computations. (Sources: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json.)

Set‑up and notations (agreed baseline)
- 4‑hypertournament on finite V: equivalent to a function f:[V]^4→{±1}. For an ordered 4‑tuple (x1,x2,x3,x4) with underlying set S, we declare (x1,x2,x3,x4)∈R iff the permutation from the increasing ordering of S to (x1,…,x4) has sign equal to f(S). This satisfies (i) tuples have distinct entries, (ii) closure under even permutations, (iii) exactly one of (x1,x2,x3,x4) and (x2,x1,x3,x4) lies in R.
- For a 5‑set X, define its 5‑vector p(X)∈{±1}^X by p_x:=f(X\{x}). Isomorphisms act by p↦(ε_i(τ)·p_{τ^{-1}(i)}) with ε_i(τ)=sign of τ restricted to X\{τ^{-1}(i)}. The three isomorphism types on 5 points are denoted C5, H5, O5. For computation we may use representatives C5=(+,+,+,+,+), O5=(+,-,-,-,-), H5=(+,-,+,-,+); the orbit relation is determined by the above action (not by raw counts of pluses).

One‑point amalgamation reduction
- AP for H (class of finite 4‑hypertournaments with no induced O5) reduces to the one‑point case: Given A∈H, B=A∪{b}∈H, C=A∪{c}∈H with B∩C=A, existence of D on A∪{b,c} in H extending B and C implies full AP by iteratively adding the vertices of C\A to B.

CSP for the minimal nontrivial one‑point case |A|=4
- Fix A={1,2,3,4}, b=5, c=6. The only undetermined f‑values are the six cross 4‑sets X_{ij}={i,j,5,6} (1≤i<j≤4). Let variables x_{ij}:=f(X_{ij})∈{±1}.
- The only potentially new 5‑sets are Y_k:={5,6}∪(A\{k}) for k∈{1,2,3,4}. For each k, p(Y_k) has two fixed coordinates: p missing 6 equals p^B_k:=f_B({5}∪(A\{k})), and p missing 5 equals p^C_k:=f_C({6}∪(A\{k})); and three variable coordinates drawn from {x_{ij}} on the three pairs inside A\{k}:
  • Y_1 depends on {x_{23},x_{24},x_{34}}
  • Y_2 depends on {x_{13},x_{14},x_{34}}
  • Y_3 depends on {x_{12},x_{14},x_{24}}
  • Y_4 depends on {x_{12},x_{13},x_{23}}.
- Constraint: For each k, p(Y_k) must not lie in the O5‑orbit. This is the complete constraint system for the one‑point amalgam over A of size 4.

Base sizes |A|≤2 and |A|=3
- |A|≤2: There are no 5‑sets Y; any assignment to cross 4‑sets works, so one‑point amalgamation always succeeds.
- |A|=3: There is exactly one 5‑set Y=A∪{b,c}, with two fixed coordinates (those missing b and c) and three unknowns (those missing each a∈A). We expect (and plan to verify computationally) that for every (α,β)∈{±1}^2 at least one of the 8 assignments to the three unknowns avoids the O5 orbit. This settles one‑point amalgamation at size 3 once verified.

Switching: what it does and what it does not
- For ε:V→{±1}, define f^ε(S):=(∏_{v∈S}ε(v))·f(S). Then f^ε encodes another 4‑hypertournament.
- Caution: For a fixed 5‑set X, switching at a vertex v∈X flips the four coordinates of p(X) corresponding to the 4‑sets that contain v and leaves the coordinate “missing v” unchanged. This can change the 5‑type: e.g., (+,-,-,-,-) (an O5 representative) switches at the ‘+’ vertex to (+,+,+,+,+) (a C5 representative). Thus switching is not a valid normalization trick for fixed one‑point data (B,C) in H.

Computational plan (to settle |A|=3 and |A|=4)
- Step A: Compute the O5 orbit via the S5 action above; implement IsO5(p).
- Step B (|A|=3): For each (α,β), enumerate the 8 triples, test IsO5, and record that at least one choice avoids O5.
- Step C (|A|=4): Enumerate compatible (B,C) (both of type C5 or H5, agreeing on f(A)), form p^B_k,p^C_k (k=1..4), and brute‑force the 2^6 choices of x_{ij}, rejecting any assignment for which some Y_k is O5. Record either a counterexample or certify all cases pass.
- Precompute F(α,β)⊆{±1}^3: the allowed triples for a 5‑set with given two fixed coordinates. Then the |A|=4 CSP checks membership of the four triangle‑triples in F(p^B_k,p^C_k).

Constructive ansatz to test
- Try x_{ij}=w_iw_j with w_i:=p^B_i·p^C_i for i∈A. For T={i,j,k} this gives a triple (w_iw_j,w_iw_k,w_jw_k) of product +1. If this never yields O5 for any (p^B_k,p^C_k), it provides a uniform construction for all |A| (worth testing; not proved).

Proposition 1 (Orientation function model).
For a finite set V, giving a 4‑hypertournament structure (V,R) satisfying: (i) all tuples in R have distinct entries; (ii) R is closed under even permutations of coordinates; (iii) for every 4‑tuple of distinct vertices (x1,x2,x3,x4), exactly one of (x1,x2,x3,x4) and (x2,x1,x3,x4) lies in R; is equivalent to giving an arbitrary function f:[V]^4→{±1}.
Proof. Given f, declare (x1,x2,x3,x4)∈R iff the permutation from the increasing ordering of S={x1,x2,x3,x4} to (x1,…,x4) has sign equal to f(S). This satisfies (i)–(iii) by construction. Conversely, given R with (i)–(iii), fix any 4‑set S and any increasing ordering s of S. By (iii), exactly one of s and its swap lies in R; define f(S)=+1 if s∈R and f(S)=−1 otherwise. By (ii) and (iii), membership of any ordered tuple from S depends only on the parity relative to s, so f is well defined and recovers R. ∎

Lemma 2 (One‑point amalgamation suffices for AP in H).
Let H be the class of finite 4‑hypertournaments omitting O5. Suppose that whenever A∈H and B=A∪{b}∈H and C=A∪{c}∈H with B∩C=A, there exists D∈H on A∪{b,c} extending both B and C. Then H has the amalgamation property.
Proof. Given B0,B1∈H over A, enumerate C\A as c1,…,ck and set A0:=A. Inductively, amalgamate Bi with Ai∪{ci} over Ai to obtain Bi+1 on Ai+1:=Ai∪{ci}. At each step, by hypothesis, all 5‑sets involving the new vertex ci avoid O5, and previously constructed parts are unchanged. After k steps we obtain an amalgam D∈H of B0 and C over A. ∎

Proposition 3 (CSP formulation of the |A|=4 one‑point step).
Let A={1,2,3,4}, b, c new. Given B on A∪{b} and C on A∪{c} in H that agree on A, any amalgam D on A∪{b,c} is determined on new 4‑sets by the six values x_{ij}:=f({i,j,b,c}) (1≤i<j≤4). The only new 5‑sets are Y_k:={b,c}∪(A\{k}) for k=1,2,3,4. Writing p^B_k:=f_B({b}∪(A\{k})) and p^C_k:=f_C({c}∪(A\{k})), the 5‑vector p(Y_k) has two fixed coordinates (missing c gives p^B_k; missing b gives p^C_k) and three coordinates equal to the x_{ij} for {i,j}⊂A\{k}. D∈H iff for each k, p(Y_k) is not in the O5 orbit.
Proof. All 4‑sets contained in B or C are already fixed. The only 4‑sets not contained in B or C are precisely the six X_{ij}={i,j,b,c}. The only new 5‑subsets of A∪{b,c} (relative to B and C) are those that contain both b and c; there are exactly four, the Y_k. Their p‑vectors depend on the listed values. Avoidance of O5 on all 5‑sets is thus equivalent to the stated four constraints. ∎

Corollary 4 (Trivial one‑point cases |A|≤2).
If |A|≤2, then one‑point amalgamation always succeeds in H.
Proof. When |A|≤2 there are no 3‑subsets of A, hence no 5‑sets of the form {b,c}∪T with T⊂A of size 3. Thus there are no new 5‑set constraints; any assignment to cross 4‑sets yields an amalgam in H. ∎

Fact 5 (Switching yields a 4‑hypertournament but may change 5‑types).
For ε:V→{±1}, define f^ε(S):=(∏_{v∈S}ε(v))·f(S). Then f^ε encodes a 4‑hypertournament. However, for a fixed 5‑set X, switching at v∈X flips the four coordinates of p(X) corresponding to 4‑sets containing v and leaves the coordinate “missing v” unchanged; this can change the isomorphism type on X (e.g., an O5 representative (+,-,-,-,-) switches at its ‘+’ vertex to (+,+,+,+,+), a C5 representative). ∎

High-level assessment
Both reports make solid progress by (i) recasting 4‑hypertournaments via an orientation function f:[V]^4→{±1}, (ii) reducing AP to one‑point amalgamation, and (iii) formulating the one‑point step for |A|=4 as a finite CSP with six cross variables and four 5‑set constraints. This is the right reduction and gives an auditable path to a definitive decision.

Corrections and rigor audit
- Orientation function model (Prover 02, Lemma 1): Correct. For each 4‑set S, choosing one parity class determines R on S and choices across different S are independent. This is the cleanest formalism and we adopt it.
- One‑point amalgamation suffices for AP (both): Correct. The iterative addition of vertices c1,…,ck to B preserves H because at step i every 5‑set involving ci is controlled by the one‑point amalgamation at that step, including those with previously added vertices (they lie in the current base Ai).
- CSP formulation for |A|=4 (both): Correct. The only unknown f‑values are on the six cross 4‑sets X_{ij}={i,j,b,c}, and the only new 5‑sets are Y_k={b,c}∪(A\{k}). Each Y_k depends on three variables and two fixed bits p^B_k, p^C_k.
- Misstatement about “switching” (Prover 01): The claim “switching preserves being O5 vs non‑O5” for a fixed 5‑set is false. Example: for p=(+,-,-,-,-) (an O5 representative), switching at the vertex corresponding to the unique ‘+’ flips the other four coordinates, yielding (+,+,+,+,+) (a C5 representative). So switching changes the local 5‑type; it does not preserve O5/non‑O5 on a fixed 5‑set. It does preserve the 4‑hypertournament axioms globally.
- Representatives and sign conventions: The two reports choose different canonical 5‑vectors for C5/H5/O5. That’s fine as long as Step A computes the full S5‑orbit of O5 under the correct action p↦(ε_i(τ)·p_{τ^{-1}(i)}) and tests membership invariantly. Do not rely on the raw count of “+” entries.
- |A|≤2 one‑point step: Trivial and correct; no 5‑set constraints exist. |A|=3: Prover 01’s “<8” count of O5 among the 2^3 assignments is plausible but unproven here; we should settle it by the orbit computation (Step A) and a tiny enumeration.

Promising directions and concrete next steps
1) Implement Step A once and for all: compute the O5 orbit in {±1}^5 via p↦(ε_i(τ)·p_{τ^{-1}(i)}). Produce a function IsO5(p).
2) One‑point, |A|=3: For each (α,β)∈{±1}^2, enumerate the 8 triples and count how many yield O5 for the unique 5‑set; record that at least one choice avoids O5. This will put the |A|=3 case on record.
3) One‑point, |A|=4: Enumerate all compatible (B,C) up to relabeling of A (B and C of types C5 or H5, agreeing on f(A)). For each pair, solve the 6‑variable CSP by brute force using IsO5 on Y_k, k=1..4. Either find an unsatisfiable case (certifies AP fails) or certify satisfiability for all pairs (strong evidence toward AP).
4) Precompute local constraint sets F(α,β)⊆{±1}^3: the allowed triples for a 5‑set given its two fixed coordinates. This collapses the |A|=4 CSP to four membership tests in precomputed sets and isolates the true obstruction structure.
5) Optional constructive ansatz to test: x_{ij}=w_iw_j with w_i:=α(i)β(i) for i∈A. If it always passes, it yields a uniform construction for all |A|; otherwise the failing pattern will guide a counterexample.

Key cautions
- Do not use switching to enlarge allowed sets; it alters B and C as well as the 5‑types, so it is not a safe normalization for the fixed one‑point diagram.
- Ensure the compatibility condition on the common 4‑set A is enforced when enumerating B and C.

Proposition 3 (CSP formulation of the |A|=4 one‑point step).
Let A={1,2,3,4}, b, c new. Given B on A∪{b} and C on A∪{c} in H that agree on A, any amalgam D on A∪{b,c} is determined on new 4‑sets by the six values x_{ij}:=f({i,j,b,c}) (1≤i<j≤4).

D∈H iff for each k, p(Y_k) is not in the O5 orbit.
Proof. All 4‑sets contained in B or C are already fixed. The only 4‑sets not contained in B or C are precisely the six X_{ij}={i,j,b,c}.

However, for a fixed 5‑set X, switching at v∈X flips the four coordinates of p(X) corresponding to 4‑sets containing v and leaves the coordinate “missing v” unchanged; this can change the isomorphism type on X (e.g., an O5 representative (+,-,-,-,-) switches at its ‘+’ vertex to (+,+,+,+,+), a C5 representative). ∎
