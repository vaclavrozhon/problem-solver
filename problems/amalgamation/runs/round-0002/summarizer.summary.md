This round validated the core reductions from output.md while correcting a mistaken “switching” normalization and identified two remaining gaps: the |A|=3 α≠β subcase and the concrete F(α,β) tables needed to finish the |A|=4 CSP. A concrete, implementable formula for the S5 signed action was derived (ε_i(τ)=sgn(τ)·(−1)^{c_{τ^{-1}(i)}(τ)} with c_j the inversion count), together with the product identity ∏ε_i=sgn(τ). The recommended computational route is to build IsO5 by orbit enumeration of p_O, compute the two small constraint tables F_eq=F(+,+) and F_opp=F(+,−) (each ≤8 triples), finish |A|=3 by lookup, then brute-force the 6-variable |A|=4 CSP (64 assignments) on representative B,C profiles. Two lemmas were proved: (A) |A|=3 with α=β solved by the all-equal triple, and (B) |A|=4 aligned B,C solved by constant cross-edges. A promising uniform ansatz x_{ij}=w_i w_j (w_i=p^B_i p^C_i) was proposed to try across cases. Concrete next steps and tests were listed for the verifier. Cited file: prover-01.out.json (progress_md).
