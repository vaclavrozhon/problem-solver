  "summary_md": "This round validated the core reductions from output.md while correcting a mistaken “switching” normalization and identified two remaining gaps: the |A|=3 α≠β subcase and the concrete F(α,β) tables needed to finish the |A|=4 CSP. A concrete, implementable formula for the S5 signed action was derived (ε_i(τ)=sgn(τ)·(−1)^{c_{τ^{-1}(i)}(τ)} with c_j the inversion count), together with the product identity ∏ε_i=sgn(τ). The recommended computational route is to build IsO5 by orbit enumeration of p_O, compute the two small constraint tables F_eq=F(+,+) and F_opp=F(+,−) (each ≤8 triples), finish |A|=3 by lookup, then brute-force the 6-variable |A|=4 CSP (64 assignments) on representative B,C profiles. Two lemmas were proved: (A) |A|=3 with α=β solved by the all-equal triple, and (B) |A|=4 aligned B,C solved by constant cross-edges. A promising uniform ansatz x_{ij}=w_i w_j (w_i=p^B_i p^C_i) was proposed to try across cases. Concrete next steps and tests were listed for the verifier.

  "highlights": [
    "Core reductions (orientation-function model, one-point sufficiency, 6-variable |A|=4 CSP) are correct; earlier switching claim was fixed.",
    "Explicit S5 signed-action formula provided: ε_i(τ)=sgn(τ)·(−1)^{c_{τ^{-1}(i)}(τ)} and ∏ε_i=sgn(τ) — gives a deterministic IsO5 implementation.",
    "Problem reduces to two small local tables F_eq and F_opp (each ≤8 triples) describing which 3-triples avoid O5 when two positions are fixed.",
    "Lemma A: |A|=3 is solved when α=β (choose all-equal triple → C5/non-O5). The α≠β subcase remains to be checked by F_opp.",
    "Lemma B: |A|=4 'aligned' B and C (agreeing on A) solved by setting all cross variables equal (constant-sign gives C5).",
    "Ansatz x_{ij}=w_i w_j (w_i=p^B_i p^C_i) is a simple global construction to test; if it always works it may generalize."

  "next_questions": [
    "Implement IsO5 via the signed S5 action and enumerate the O5 orbit; compute and report F_eq and F_opp (lists and sizes).",
    "Use those tables to complete |A|=3 (α≠β) and run the |A|=4 6-variable CSP on canonical profiles P1–P4 (report SAT/UNSAT and example assignments).",
    "Test the ansatz x_{ij}=w_i w_j across all representative |A|=4 cases; if it always succeeds, attempt to convert it into a uniform proof."
