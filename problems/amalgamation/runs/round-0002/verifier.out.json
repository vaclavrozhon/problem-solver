  "feedback_md": "High-level assessment: This round contains one solid, actionable contribution (a precise formula for the S5 action on 5-vectors and a product identity), a promising plan to tabulate the small local constraint sets F(\u03b1,\u03b2), and several reasonable test profiles and a constructive ansatz for |A|=4. However, one purported lemma (the \u201cfully aligned\u201d Lemma B) is incorrect as stated; and the |A|=3 claim (Lemma A) relies on an unproven orbit separation. I separate what we can adopt rigorously now from what requires computation or correction, and I give concrete next steps.\n\nWhat\u2019s correct and useful now:\n- The action formula \u03b5_i(\u03c4) = sgn(\u03c4)\u00b7(\u22121)^{c_{\u03c4^{-1}(i)}(\u03c4)} is consistent with our definition \u201c\u03b5_i is the sign of \u03c4 on the 4-subset obtained by deleting \u03c4^{-1}(i)\u201d. I provide a short rigorous proof and add it to outputs.md, together with the product identity \u220f \u03b5_i(\u03c4) = sgn(\u03c4). This will greatly reduce implementation ambiguity for IsO5(p).\n- The proposed program to precompute F(\u03b1,\u03b2) and reduce |A|=3 and |A|=4 to tiny enumerations is sound and should be our immediate priority.\n- The test profiles P1\u2013P4 and the ansatz x_{ij} = w_i w_j (with w_i := p^B_i p^C_i) are valuable for triage; they can quickly expose either a counterexample or a pattern that suggests a general proof.\n\nCorrections and cautions:\n- Lemma B as written is false. If p^B_k = p^C_k for all k but the common 4-bit pattern is not constant across k, then setting all x_{ij} = \u03b4 cannot make every p(Y_k) constant \u03b4; hence the proof fails. A correct (but much weaker) statement is: if p^B_k = p^C_k = \u03b4 for all k (i.e., the 4-bit pattern is constant), then x_{ij} \u2261 \u03b4 makes all p(Y_k) constant \u03b4 and thus non-O5. I record this corrected version in the notes and not in outputs (it is trivial but correct).\n- Symmetry for F(\u03b1,\u03b2): do not assume a priori that F(+,+)=F(\u2212,\u2212) or F(+,-)=F(\u2212,+). While these equalities are plausible, they require an explicit S5 argument fixing the two \u201cfixed\u201d positions and tracking \u03b5-signs; since the table is tiny, just compute all four F(\u03b1,\u03b2) cases. If equalities hold, the computation will reveal them anyway.\n- Lemma A (|A|=3, \u03b1=\u03b2 with x=y=z=\u03b1) produces a constant 5-vector; it is almost certainly non-O5, but since we have not yet proved orbit separation in outputs.md, treat this as a check to be confirmed via IsO5. I keep it as a \u201csanity case\u201d in notes, not as a formal output.\n\nConcrete next steps (minimal and auditable):\n1) Implement IsO5(p): using the appended lemma, generate the 120 signed actions and form the orbit of the seed O5 vector (+,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212); decide membership by set lookup.\n2) Compute F(\u03b1,\u03b2) for all four \u03b1,\u03b2 \u2208 {\u00b11}: enumerate the 8 triples (x,y,z), test IsO5 on p=(\u03b1,\u03b2,x,y,z), and record the allowed triples explicitly. Include the observed symmetries (if any) in notes.\n3) Conclude |A|=3: For each (\u03b1,\u03b2), check that at least one triple is allowed. Save an explicit allowed triple per case.\n4) |A|=4 CSP: For profiles P1\u2013P4 (and then modulo-S4 representatives), brute-force the 64 assignments to x_{ij}. Report SAT/UNSAT and, if SAT, an explicit assignment. Test the ansatz x_{ij}=w_i w_j as a fast candidate; report whether it succeeds across tested profiles.\n5) Archive: Store the computed F tables, all found solutions/unsats, and any discovered symmetries in notes.md.\n\nWith these steps, we will either find a clean counterexample (refuting AP) or build strong evidence (and possibly a uniform construction) toward AP, with fully auditable, minimal computations.",
  "new_notes_md": "Addendum: explicit S5 action, corrections, and computation plan\n\n1) Explicit \u03b5-formula for the S5 action (implementation aid)\nFor \u03c4 \u2208 S5 and i \u2208 {1,\u2026,5}, write j := \u03c4^{-1}(i) and define\nc_j(\u03c4) := |{k<j : \u03c4(k) > \u03c4(j)}| + |{k>j : \u03c4(k) < \u03c4(j)}|.\nThen the sign multiplier in the action p\u2032_i = \u03b5_i(\u03c4)\u00b7p_{\u03c4^{-1}(i)} equals\n\u03b5_i(\u03c4) = sgn(\u03c4)\u00b7(\u22121)^{c_j(\u03c4)}.\nSketch of justification: Let \u03c4\u2032 be the induced bijection from [5]\\{j} to [5]\\{i}. Its inversion count is inv(\u03c4\u2032) = inv(\u03c4) \u2212 c_j(\u03c4) because the inversions of \u03c4 decompose into those not involving j (which biject with the inversions of \u03c4\u2032) and those involving j (counted by c_j). Hence sgn(\u03c4\u2032) = (\u22121)^{inv(\u03c4\u2032)} = (\u22121)^{inv(\u03c4)\u2212c_j} = sgn(\u03c4)\u00b7(\u22121)^{c_j}. By definition \u03b5_i(\u03c4) = sgn(\u03c4\u2032). A immediate corollary is the product identity \u220f_{i=1}^5 \u03b5_i(\u03c4) = sgn(\u03c4), since \u03a3_j c_j(\u03c4) = 2\u00b7inv(\u03c4).\n\nPractical note: This eliminates ambiguity about \u03b5 and supports a robust IsO5 enumerator.\n\n2) Correction to the \u201cfully aligned\u201d claim\nThe statement \u201cIf p^B_k = p^C_k for all k then setting all x_{ij}=\u03b4 makes p(Y_k) constant \u03b4 for all k\u201d is false unless the common pattern (p^B_k)_{k\u2208A} is itself constant with value \u03b4. Counterexample: take p^B=p^C=(+,+,\u2212,+) and \u03b4=+. Then for k=3 the fixed coordinates are (\u2212,\u2212) while the three variables are +, so p(Y_3) is not constant. A correct (weaker) statement is: if p^B_k = p^C_k = \u03b4 for all k, then x_{ij}\u2261\u03b4 makes every p(Y_k) constant \u03b4, hence non-O5.\n\n3) F(\u03b1,\u03b2) tables: compute all four cases\nDefine F(\u03b1,\u03b2) \u2286 {\u00b11}^3 as the set of triples (x,y,z) for which p=(\u03b1,\u03b2,x,y,z) is non-O5. Do not assume F(+,+)=F(\u2212,\u2212) or F(+,-)=F(\u2212,+) a priori; compute all four cases. This is an 8\u00d74=32-evaluation task. Record each F(\u03b1,\u03b2) explicitly along with any observed symmetries (e.g., invariance under permuting x,y,z).\n\nConsequence: |A|=3 reduces to checking that for each (\u03b1,\u03b2) there exists at least one triple in F(\u03b1,\u03b2). Archive one such triple per case.\n\n4) |A|=4 CSP protocol (profiles and ansatz)\n- Use the already-recorded CSP with variables x_{ij} on the six edges of K4 and four constraints Y_k. For any concrete pair (B,C) over A with B\u2229C=A and both omitting O5, determine the four pairs (p^B_k,p^C_k) and require the corresponding triangle-triple to lie in F(p^B_k,p^C_k).\n- Profiles to test early:\n  \u2022 P1: p^B\u2261+, p^C\u2261+. The corrected alignment lemma (constant case) gives the assignment x_{ij}\u2261+.\n  \u2022 P2: p^B\u2261+, p^C\u2261\u2212. Try the perfect-matching assignment x_{12}=x_{34}=+, others \u2212; check all four Y_k via IsO5.\n  \u2022 P3: p^B\u2261+, p^C drawn from an H5 labeling consistent on A; try ansatz x_{ij}=w_i w_j with w_i=p^B_i p^C_i.\n  \u2022 P4: both sides H5 aligned on A; by the corrected alignment lemma with \u03b4=+, x_{ij}\u2261+ works if the common 4-bit pattern on A is constant +.\n- Constructive ansatz: x_{ij}:=w_i w_j where w_i:=p^B_i p^C_i. For T={i,j,k}, the triple is (w_i w_j, w_i w_k, w_j w_k) with product +1. Test this uniformly across enumerated cases; if it always avoids O5, it suggests a uniform construction for general |A|.\n\n5) Unit tests for IsO5\n- p=(+,+,+,+,+) should classify non-O5; p=(+,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212) should classify O5; p=(+,\u2212,+,\u2212,+) should classify non-O5 (H5). Also verify that for a transposition \u03c4, \u220f_i p\u2032_i flips sign (product identity) and that orbit membership is invariant under the action.\n\n6) Checklist for the next round\n- Implement IsO5 with the \u03b5-formula; report the size of the O5 orbit found by enumeration.\n- Compute and list F(\u03b1,\u03b2) for all four cases; confirm |A|=3.\n- Run the |A|=4 CSP on P1\u2013P4 first, then extend to representatives modulo S4 on A; archive satisfying/unsatisfying assignments.\n- Report whether the ansatz x_{ij}=w_i w_j succeeds in all tested instances.\n",

Let \u03c4\u2032 be the induced bijection from [5]\\{j} to [5]\\{i}, obtained by deleting position j in the domain and value i in the codomain. By definition, \u03b5_i(\u03c4)=sgn(\u03c4\u2032). The inversions of \u03c4 split into two disjoint families: those not involving j (which correspond bijectively to inversions of \u03c4\u2032) and those involving j, whose number is c_j(\u03c4) by definition. Hence inv(\u03c4)=inv(\u03c4\u2032)+c_j(\u03c4), so sgn(\u03c4)= (\u22121)^{inv(\u03c4)} = (\u22121)^{inv(\u03c4\u2032)+c_j(\u03c4)} = sgn(\u03c4\u2032)\u00b7(\u22121)^{c_j(\u03c4)} = \u03b5_i(\u03c4)\u00b7(\u22121)^{c_j(\u03c4)}.

Using \u03b5_i(\u03c4) = sgn(\u03c4)\u00b7(\u22121)^{c_{\u03c4^{-1}(i)}(\u03c4)} and the fact that each inversion contributes 1 to c_a and 1 to c_b, we have \u03a3_{j=1}^5 c_j(\u03c4) = 2\u00b7inv(\u03c4). Therefore \u220f_{i=1}^5 \u03b5_i(\u03c4) = sgn(\u03c4)^5 \u00b7 (\u22121)^{\u03a3_j c_j(\u03c4)} = sgn(\u03c4)\u00b7(\u22121)^{2\u00b7inv(\u03c4)} = sgn(\u03c4). \u220e",
