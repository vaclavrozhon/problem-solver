High-level assessment: This round contains one solid, actionable contribution (a precise formula for the S5 action on 5-vectors and a product identity), a promising plan to tabulate the small local constraint sets F(α,β), and several reasonable test profiles and a constructive ansatz for |A|=4. However, one purported lemma (the “fully aligned” Lemma B) is incorrect as stated; and the |A|=3 claim (Lemma A) relies on an unproven orbit separation. I separate what we can adopt rigorously now from what requires computation or correction, and I give concrete next steps.
