  "progress_md": "## Status and focus\n- Outputs.md currently contains: the orientation-function model (Prop. 1), one-point sufficiency (Lemma 2), the |A|=4 CSP formulation (Prop. 3), trivial |A|\u22642 (Cor. 4), a caution on switching (Fact 5), and the explicit S5 action/identity (Lemma 6, Cor. 7). These are correct and useful.\n- Missing pieces to settle AP: explicit characterization of the 5-vector O5-orbit membership for the small \u201ctwo-fixed plus three-free\u201d situations; the tables F(\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2286{\u00b11}^3; a proof of the |A|=3 one-point case; and a resolution of the |A|=4 6-variable CSP across all compatible B,C.\n\n## New observations and micro-lemmas (auditable)\n1) Interpretation of the fixed bits p^B_k and p^C_k.\n- For B on A\u222a{b}, the four fixed signs p^B_k (k\u2208A) are exactly the indicator (via +/\u2212) of which vertices of A are \u201cpositive\u201d in the 5-vertex structure induced by B (i.e., k is positive in B iff the increasing 4-tuple on {b}\u222a(A\\{k}) is in R_B).\n- Same for C. Why useful: This ties the |A|=4 profiles directly to the 5-point types of B and C and justifies reducing the search by S4-symmetry on A.\n\n2) Necessary local exclusions for the \u201copposite\u201d case (to be used as quick unit checks).\n- Claim N1: With \u03b1=+ and \u03b2=\u2212, the triple (x,y,z)=(\u2212,\u2212,\u2212) yields p=(+;\u2212;\u2212,\u2212,\u2212) which is the canonical labeled O5 representative; hence forbidden. Symmetrically, with \u03b1=\u2212 and \u03b2=+, the triple (+,+,+) yields p=(\u2212;+;+,+,+) which is in the O5 orbit (by the same reasoning after swapping the two fixed positions and re-enumerating); thus forbidden as well.\n- Why useful: This gives immediate necessary constraints that any F(+,-) and F(-,+) must omit. It also supplies two easy sanity tests for any IsO5 implementation.\n\n3) Triangle/edge perspective and a structured ansatz.\n- Variables are on edges of K_4 on A: x_{ij}\u2208{\u00b11} for 1\u2264i<j\u22644. Each constraint Y_k involves the triangle on T=A\\{k}. This viewpoint helps reason about compatibility.\n- Structured ansatz (to test): pick signs w_i\u2208{\u00b11} on vertices and set x_{ij}:=w_i w_j. Then for any triangle {i,j,k}, the triple is (w_iw_j,w_iw_k,w_jw_k) and has product +1. Among the 8 patterns, this ansatz realises exactly the four with product +1: (+++), (+\u2212\u2212), (\u2212+\u2212), (\u2212\u2212+).\n- Why useful: If all constraints admit at least one of these four patterns (per their (\u03b1,\u03b2)), one can try to choose w_i to satisfy all triangles simultaneously. This reduces the search to a low-complexity global choice of four bits w_i; it is easy to brute-force (2^4=16) and scales to general |A| as well.\n\n4) Reduction by eq/opp pattern across k.\n- For the |A|=4 CSP, only the pair (\u03b1_k,\u03b2_k) for each k matters via the choice F(\u03b1_k,\u03b2_k) of allowed triples; the absolute signs on A\u2019s 4-set in B and C do not enter the new constraints. Hence, modulo S4 on A, it suffices to test the 16 eq/opp patterns E\u2286A where E={k: \u03b1_k=\u03b2_k} (provided we use the full F(\u03b1,\u03b2) tables rather than assuming F(+,+)=F(\u2212,\u2212), etc.). This organizes the exhaustive check and avoids unnecessary duplication.\n\n## Explicit computational blueprint (refined)\nA) Build IsO5(p) correctly.\n- Use Lemma 6 to compute \u03b5_i(\u03c4)=sgn(\u03c4)(\u22121)^{c_{\u03c4^{-1}(i)}(\u03c4)} for all \u03c4\u2208S5.\n- Generate the O5 orbit as O = { (\u03b5(\u03c4)\u00b7e1\u2218\u03c4^{-1}) : \u03c4\u2208S5 }, with e1=(+,-,-,-,-) in the chosen labeling.\n- Implement IsO5(p): return true iff p\u2208O.\n- Unit tests: IsO5(+,+,+,+,+)=false; IsO5(+,-,-,-,-)=true; IsO5(+,-,+,-,+)=false. Also verify orbit size (report it) and closure under the action.\n\nB) Compute the local tables F(\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2286{\u00b11}^3.\n- For each (\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2208{\u00b11}^2, enumerate the 8 triples (x,y,z) and evaluate IsO5 on p=(\u03b1,\u03b2,x,y,z). Record F(\u03b1,\u03b2) as the complement of the O5 cases. Store the full tables (do not assume symmetries a priori), and note any observed invariances (e.g., under permuting x,y,z).\n- Immediate checks: verify Claim N1 above is reflected (i.e., (\u2212,\u2212,\u2212)\u2209F(+,-) and (+,+,+)\u2209F(\u2212,+)); verify (+++)\u2208F(+,+) and (\u2212,\u2212,\u2212)\u2208F(\u2212,\u2212) (constant 5-vectors are non-O5).\n\nC) Conclude |A|=3 one-point amalgamation.\n- For each (\u03b1,\u03b2), check that F(\u03b1,\u03b2) is nonempty and archive one explicit triple per case. This settles |A|=3 rigorously.\n\nD) Solve the |A|=4 6-variable CSP.\n- For a given eq/opp pattern E\u2286{1,2,3,4}, impose that the triangle on A\\{k} chooses a triple in F(\u03b1_k,\u03b2_k), i.e., in F(+,+) if k\u2208E, or in F(+,-) otherwise (after fixing a concrete representative with \u03b1_k,\u03b2_k; the concrete sign choices do not matter because the constraint is picked by the (\u03b1,\u03b2) pair).\n- Two complementary solvers:\n  \u2022 Brute-force x_{ij} (2^6=64) and check all four Y_k via IsO5 by constructing p(Y_k) explicitly; report SAT/UNSAT.\n  \u2022 Try the structured ansatz x_{ij}=w_i w_j (2^4=16 assignments) and accept if each triangle\u2019s triple lands in F(\u03b1_k,\u03b2_k). If this always succeeds across all tested patterns, we get a strong template for general |A|.\n- Start with the four canonical profiles (P1\u2013P4 from notes) and then cover all 16 eq/opp patterns modulo S4.\n\nE) Optional but informative: enumerate actual pairs (B,C) up to S4 on A.\n- Extract p^B_k and p^C_k patterns realizable by C5/H5 on B and C (as 4-bit vectors), ensuring B and C agree on A\u2019s 4-set; then feed their induced eq/opp signatures to step D. This cross-checks that all emergent eq/opp patterns indeed arise from valid (B,C).\n\n## Why this is concrete progress\n- We isolated a sharp necessary exclusion (Claim N1) that provides immediate unit tests and sanity checks for F(\u03b1,\u03b2).\n- We clarified exactly how the four fixed signs p^B_k and p^C_k are determined by the 5-point types on B and C, which justifies organizing the |A|=4 exploration by eq/opp patterns and S4 symmetry.\n- We provided a structured, low-complexity ansatz (x_{ij}=w_iw_j) that, if accepted by the F(\u03b1,\u03b2) tables, yields a uniform construction and a plausible path to all |A| by iterated one-point steps.\n- The refined computational blueprint reduces ambiguity (e.g., coordinate ordering in Y_k) and pinpoints the minimal data to archive (F(\u03b1,\u03b2) tables, eq/opp SAT results, and, if found, a counterexample assignment witnessing failure of AP).\n\n## Obstacles and open items\n- Analytic classification of the O5 orbit in {\u00b11}^5 under the signed S5 action remains nontrivial; we rely (appropriately) on small-scale enumeration suggested above.\n- We intentionally do not assert symmetries like F(+,+)=F(\u2212,\u2212) without computation. These might hold but are not needed to proceed.\n- The structured ansatz may fail in some patterns; in that case, fallback to the 2^6 brute-force solver will still decide the |A|=4 CSP.\n\n## Next steps for the verifier (minimal, checkable)\n1) Implement IsO5 with Lemma 6; report orbit size and perform the unit tests (three vectors and an action-closure check).\n2) Compute and record all four F(\u03b1,\u03b2) tables; confirm Claim N1 and that (+++)\u2208F(+,+), (\u2212,\u2212,\u2212)\u2208F(\u2212,\u2212). Conclude |A|=3 by listing one allowed triple per (\u03b1,\u03b2).\n3) For |A|=4, first test the four profiles P1\u2013P4 (from notes) and then the 16 eq/opp patterns modulo S4 using the 2^6 brute force. Archive a satisfying assignment x_{ij} for each SAT case; if any UNSAT appears, this is a concrete counterexample to AP.\n4) Test the structured ansatz x_{ij}=w_iw_j across all patterns; if it always succeeds, note it as a candidate general construction and we will attempt to lift it to arbitrary |A| next.\n\n## Notes on outputs.md\n- No errors detected in the current statements. A minor clarification we already kept in notes: the \u201caligned B,C\u201d constant-triple trick works only when the common 4-bit pattern on A is constant (then taking all x_{ij} equal produces constant 5-vectors). This was previously mis-stated in a draft and has been corrected (not present in outputs.md).\n- Still missing from outputs.md (for future addition once computed): the |A|=3 one-point lemma (with explicit witnesses per (\u03b1,\u03b2)) and the resolution of the |A|=4 CSP (either a general construction or a minimal counterexample)."
