{"summary_md":"This round produced a concrete, checkable plan to finish the remaining small-case verifications for AP. outputs.md already records the orientation-function model, one-point sufficiency lemmas, the |A|=4 CSP formulation, trivial |A|≤2 cases, and the S5-action identity; missing are (i) an explicit O5-orbit classification for the “two-fixed + three-free” 5-vectors, (ii) the four local tables F(α,β)⊆{±1}^3, (iii) a |A|=3 one-point proof (with witnesses), and (iv) a resolution of the |A|=4 6-variable CSP. New micro-lemmas: p^B_k/p^C_k are exactly the fixed “positive” bits coming from 5-point types (justifying S4-reduction); Claim N1 rules out (−,−,−) for (α,+;β,−) and symmetrically (+,+,+) for (α,−;β,+) (easy IsO5 unit tests); a triangle/edge ansatz x_{ij}=w_iw_j realizes all product +1 triangle patterns and reduces the global search to 2^4 choices (fallback brute force is 2^6=64). A concrete computational blueprint (implement IsO5 via Lemma 6, compute F tables, prove |A|=3 by exhibiting triples, exhaust |A|=4 via eq/opp patterns modulo S4 using brute force and the ansatz) was provided.
