  "feedback_md": "High-level assessment: The report is well-aligned with the current framework (orientation-function model, one-point reduction, CSP for |A|=4) and presents concrete, auditable steps. Most micro-lemmas are correct as stated. The computational blueprint is sound and sufficiently specified to be implemented. There is, however, one substantive methodological pitfall regarding the reduction to eq/opp patterns; see below. I also recommend cementing a symmetry of the O5 orbit (central symmetry) that both justifies Claim N1\u2019s \u201csymmetric\u201d exclusion and reduces the number of F(\u03b1,\u03b2) tables that must be computed.\n\nWhat looks correct and valuable:\n- The interpretation of p^B_k and p^C_k as the \u201cpositivity\u201d indicators on the 5-set A\u222a{b} (resp. A\u222a{c}) is correct and useful; it motivates organizing cases by the 4-bit vectors on A.\n- Claim N1 is indeed valid. The case (\u03b1,\u03b2,x,y,z)=(+;\u2212;\u2212,\u2212,\u2212) is the canonical O5 representative. The symmetric case (\u2212;+;+,+,+) is also in the O5 orbit; a clean justification is via a permutation \u03c4 with \u03b5_i(\u03c4)=\u2212 for all i, which implies \u2212O5=O5 (see Lemma added to output.md).\n- The triangle/edge view and ansatz x_{ij}=w_iw_j are coherent. The ansatz realizes exactly the four product +1 triples (+++),(+\u2212\u2212),(\u2212+\u2212),(\u2212\u2212+).\n- The computational plan for IsO5 via Lemma 6 is precise and testable; the unit tests are good. Recording the orbit size and a closure check is helpful.\n\nCautions and corrections:\n- Reduction to eq/opp patterns: As written it implicitly assumes F(+,+)=F(\u2212,\u2212) and F(+,-)=F(\u2212,+). You correctly noted we should not assume these a priori; but later Step D uses exactly that reduction (picking F(+,+) for k\u2208E and F(+,-) for k\u2209E). This is unsafe without proof. The safe reduction is to track the four pair-types per k: {++, \u2212\u2212, +\u2212, \u2212+}. Fortunately, central symmetry of the O5 orbit yields an exact relation F(\u2212\u03b1,\u2212\u03b2)=\u2212F(\u03b1,\u03b2) (triplewise negation), so only two base tables need to be computed: F(+,+) and F(+,-); the other two follow by negating all three triple entries. I have added this as a corollary in output.md. Do still treat (+,-) and (\u2212,+) separately unless computation confirms they coincide.\n- Permuting x,y,z: Do not assume invariance a priori. The S5 action may induce sign flips on the first two coordinates under permutations of the last three, so F(\u03b1,\u03b2) need not be S3-invariant on the last three entries. Compute and record any such invariance if present.\n\nConcrete next steps (minimally checkable):\n1) Implement IsO5 with Lemma 6. Verify: (+,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212) is O5; (+,+,+,+,+), (+,\u2212,+,\u2212,+) are non-O5; and report the orbit size of O5 under the signed S5 action. Also verify existence of \u03c4 with \u03b5_i=\u2212 for all i (e.g., \u03c4=(13)).\n2) Compute and archive F(+,+) and F(+,-). Then set F(\u2212,\u2212):=\u2212F(+,+) and F(\u2212,+):=\u2212F(+,-). Record any observed invariances (e.g., under permutations of the last three coordinates or swapping the first two coordinates). Conclude |A|=3 by listing one admissible triple for each (\u03b1,\u03b2).\n3) For |A|=4, use the full per-k type vector in {++, \u2212\u2212, +\u2212, \u2212+}^A (not just E={k: \u03b1_k=\u03b2_k}). Preferably, enumerate actual pairs (B,C) (both in {C5,H5}, agreeing on A) to generate only realizable type-vectors. For each case, brute-force 2^6 assignments to x_{ij}; archive a satisfying assignment or a minimal unsat certificate.\n4) Test the structured ansatz x_{ij}=w_iw_j with w_i=p^B_i p^C_i across all realized cases. If it always succeeds, document this as a candidate general construction; otherwise, record the smallest failing instance (type-vector and a proof of unsatisfiability for the ansatz, even if the full brute force succeeds).\n5) Document coordinate conventions for constructing p(Y_k) consistently (ordering of the five vertices and which two coordinates are the fixed ones) so that F(\u03b1,\u03b2) is used consistently in CSP checks.\n\nThese steps will settle |A|=3 and decisively resolve the |A|=4 CSP, either uniformly (via the ansatz) or by exhaustive certification/counterexample.",
  "new_notes_md": "Additional clarifications, small lemmas, and symmetry for the 5-vector orbit\n\n1) Semantics of the fixed bits p^B_k and p^C_k (|A|=4)\nFor B on A\u222a{b} and k\u2208A, define p^B_k:=f_B({b}\u222a(A\\{k})). On the 5-set A\u222a{b}, the 5-vector p has entries p_x=f((A\u222a{b})\\{x}). Thus for k\u2208A, p^B_k coincides with the coordinate \u201cmissing k\u201d of p on A\u222a{b}: it records whether the increasing 4-tuple on {b}\u222a(A\\{k}) is in R_B. Analogously p^C_k is the coordinate \u201cmissing k\u201d of the 5-vector on A\u222a{c}.\n\n2) Necessary local exclusions in the opposite-fixed case (rigorous justification)\n- With (\u03b1,\u03b2,x,y,z)=(+;\u2212;\u2212,\u2212,\u2212) we obtain the canonical O5 representative; hence this triple is forbidden for (\u03b1,\u03b2)=(+,-).\n- By central symmetry of the O5 orbit (see 4) below), (\u2212;+;+,+,+) is also O5; hence forbidden for (\u03b1,\u03b2)=(\u2212,+).\nThese give immediate unit tests for any IsO5 implementation and constraints for F(+,-) and F(\u2212,+).\n\n3) Edge/triangle viewpoint and the structured ansatz\n- Place the six variables x_{ij} on the edges of K4 on A. The constraint Y_k uses the triangle on T=A\\{k}.\n- Structured ansatz: pick w_i\u2208{\u00b11} on the vertices and set x_{ij}:=w_i w_j. For any triangle {i,j,k}, the triple (w_iw_j,w_iw_k,w_jw_k) has product +1, realizing exactly (+++),(+\u2212\u2212),(\u2212+\u2212),(\u2212\u2212+).\n\n4) Central symmetry of the O5 orbit and a consequence for F(\u03b1,\u03b2)\nThere exists \u03c4\u2208S5, e.g. \u03c4=(13), with \u03b5_i(\u03c4)=\u22121 for all i (check via Lemma 6: c_j(\u03c4) is even for every j and sgn(\u03c4)=\u22121). Hence for any 5-vector p, p\u2208O5 iff \u2212p\u2208O5. As a consequence, for the local tables F(\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2286{\u00b11}^3 (defined by p=(\u03b1,\u03b2,x,y,z) non-O5), one has\nF(\u2212\u03b1,\u2212\u03b2) = { (\u2212x,\u2212y,\u2212z) : (x,y,z)\u2208F(\u03b1,\u03b2) }.\nTherefore it suffices to compute F(+,+) and F(+,-); the other two cases follow by triplewise negation. Do not assume any further symmetries (e.g., permutations of x,y,z or F(+,-)=F(\u2212,+)) without verification.\n\n5) On classifying |A|=4 instances\nThe constraint at each k depends on the ordered pair (p^B_k,p^C_k)\u2208{++,\u2212\u2212,+\u2212,\u2212+}. Reduction to the pure eq/opp pattern E={k: p^B_k=p^C_k} is insufficient unless one proves F(+,+)=F(\u2212,\u2212) and F(+,-)=F(\u2212,+). Use the full type-vector in {++,\u2212\u2212,+\u2212,\u2212+}^A. By 4), it is enough to compute and store F(+,+), F(+,-), and infer the other two by negation.\n\n6) Implementation checklist (precise conventions)\n- Fix, once and for all, an ordering of the five vertices of each Y_k with the first two positions corresponding to the coordinates \u201cmissing c\u201d and \u201cmissing b\u201d, respectively, and the last three to the vertices of A\\{k} in increasing order. Use the same convention for constructing p=(\u03b1,\u03b2,x,y,z) when populating F(\u03b1,\u03b2).\n- Implement IsO5 via Lemma 6. Unit tests: (+,+,+,+,+) is non-O5; (+,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212) is O5; (+,\u2212,+,\u2212,+) is non-O5. Report the orbit size and verify closure under the action.\n- Compute F(+,+), F(+,-); obtain F(\u2212,\u2212), F(\u2212,+) by triplewise negation. Conclude |A|=3 by listing one admissible triple for each (\u03b1,\u03b2).\n- For |A|=4, enumerate realizable type-vectors from actual pairs (B,C) (both C5/H5, agreeing on A), and brute-force 2^6 assignments to x_{ij}. Archive SAT witnesses or UNSAT certificates. Test the ansatz x_{ij}=w_i w_j with w_i=p^B_i p^C_i across the same cases.\n\nThese additions lock down the symmetry that underlies Claim N1, correct the eq/opp reduction, and make the forthcoming computations unambiguous and reusable.",

  "new_outputs_md": "Lemma 8 (Central symmetry of the O5 orbit).\nThere exists \u03c4\u2208S5 with \u03b5_i(\u03c4)=\u22121 for all i. In particular, for any 5-vector p one has p\u2208O5 if and only if \u2212p\u2208O5. Thus the O5 orbit is closed under global sign reversal.\n\nProof. Take \u03c4=(13) in one-line notation [3,2,1,4,5]. By Lemma 6, for j:=\u03c4^{-1}(i), \u03b5_i(\u03c4)=sgn(\u03c4)\u00b7(\u22121)^{c_j(\u03c4)}. A direct count gives c_1(\u03c4)=c_2(\u03c4)=c_3(\u03c4)=2 and c_4(\u03c4)=c_5(\u03c4)=0, so c_j(\u03c4) is even for all j. Since sgn(\u03c4)=\u22121, we get \u03b5_i(\u03c4)=\u22121 for every i. If q is in the O5 orbit, then so is R_\u03c4(q)=\u2212q\u2218\u03c4^{\u22121}. As \u03c3 ranges over S5, the set {\u2212R_\u03c3(e1)} equals {R_{\u03c4\u03c3}(e1):\u03c3\u2208S5}, hence \u2212O5=O5. \u220e\n\nCorollary 9 (Sign-flip symmetry for local tables F).\nFor F(\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2286{\u00b11}^3 defined by: (x,y,z)\u2208F(\u03b1,\u03b2) iff (\u03b1,\u03b2,x,y,z) is non-O5, one has\nF(\u2212\u03b1,\u2212\u03b2) = { (\u2212x,\u2212y,\u2212z) : (x,y,z)\u2208F(\u03b1,\u03b2) }.\n\nProof. (\u03b1,\u03b2,x,y,z) is non-O5 iff its global negation (\u2212\u03b1,\u2212\u03b2,\u2212x,\u2212y,\u2212z) is non-O5 by Lemma 8. This is exactly the stated correspondence. \u220e",
