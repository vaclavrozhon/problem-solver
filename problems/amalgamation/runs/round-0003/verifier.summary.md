High-level assessment: The report is well-aligned with the current framework (orientation-function model, one-point reduction, CSP for |A|=4) and presents concrete, auditable steps. Most micro-lemmas are correct as stated. The computational blueprint is sound and sufficiently specified to be implemented. There is, however, one substantive methodological pitfall regarding the reduction to eq/opp patterns; see below. I also recommend cementing a symmetry of the O5 orbit (central symmetry) that both justifies Claim N1’s “symmetric” exclusion and reduces the number of F(α,β) tables that must be computed.
