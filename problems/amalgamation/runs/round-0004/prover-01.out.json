  "progress_md": "## Status and focus for this round\n- We keep the CSP reduction and one\u2011point amalgamation framework from output.md and notes.md. The key unresolved item is to decide feasibility of the |A|=4 one\u2011point step, which determines AP (Lemma 2).\n- This round contributes: two concrete, checkable lemmas sharpening the local tables F(\u03b1,\u03b2); a uniform edge\u2011assignment strategy on K_4 that reduces the |A|=4 decision to verifying a very small number of membership tests in F; and a tightened computational plan that, if validated, essentially settles AP.\n\n## Ideas and micro\u2011lemmas (auditable)\n\nLemma 10 (All\u2011equal triples in the opposite\u2011fixed case are O5).\n- Statement: For F(+,-), both (+++) and (---) are forbidden (yield O5). By Corollary 9, the symmetric cases for F(\u2212,+) are also forbidden.\n- Proof sketch: (+++) with (\u03b1,\u03b2)=(+,-) gives p=(+,-,+,+,+), which has exactly one minus. There exists \u03c4 with \u03b5_i(\u03c4)=\u22121 for all i (Lemma 8), hence \u2212\u03b5=(+,+,+,+,+). Flipping one coordinate produces exactly the \u201cone discrepancy\u201d pattern, which is in the O5 orbit. Similarly, (---) with (\u03b1,\u03b2)=(+,-) yields p=(+,-,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212), which is the canonical labeled O5 representative.\u220e\n- Why useful: Gives two hard exclusions in the most constrained case; provides unit tests for IsO5 and for computed F(+,-).\n\nLemma 11 (Two\u2011plus two\u2011minus vertex signs force the triangle triple type (+\u2212\u2212) on all four Y_k).\n- Set up: Label A={1,2,3,4}. Choose vertex signs w_i\u2208{\u00b11} with exactly two + and two \u2212, and set edge variables x_{ij}:=w_i w_j for 1\u2264i<j\u22644 (the structured ansatz).\n- Claim: For each k, the triple of variables on Y_k\u2019s three edges (inside A\\{k}) is, up to permutation of its three coordinates, of the form (+,\u2212,\u2212).\n- Proof: If the missing vertex k is chosen from the + group, the included three vertices contain exactly one + and two \u2212; the three pairwise products are (+\u00b7\u2212, +\u00b7\u2212, \u2212\u00b7\u2212) = (\u2212,\u2212,+), i.e., a permutation of (+,\u2212,\u2212). If k is chosen from the \u2212 group, the included set is {+, +, \u2212}, whose pairwise products again form a permutation of (+,\u2212,\u2212).\u220e\n- Why useful: A single global choice (2+2\u2212 on vertices) makes every triangle triple equal to (+\u2212\u2212) (up to reordering). If the triple pattern (+\u2212\u2212) is allowed for all four (\u03b1_k,\u03b2_k), then this assignment simultaneously satisfies all four constraints, yielding the one\u2011point amalgam.\n\nLemma 12 (Minimal membership tests suffice to settle the |A|=4 one\u2011point amalgam via a uniform assignment).\n- Let F(\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2286{\u00b11}^3 be as in notes.md (p=(\u03b1,\u03b2,x,y,z) non\u2011O5). If the following three membership properties all hold:\n  1) (+++) \u2208 F(+,+) (already holds: p=(+,+,+,+,+) is C_5),\n  2) (+\u2212\u2212) \u2208 F(+,+), and by Corollary 9 also (\u2212, +, +) \u2208 F(\u2212,\u2212),\n  3) (+\u2212\u2212) \u2208 F(+,-), and by Corollary 9 also (+\u2212\u2212) \u2208 F(\u2212,+),\n  then the |A|=4 one\u2011point amalgamation always succeeds.\n- Proof: Distinguish two cases for a given one\u2011point diagram over A={1,2,3,4}:\n  \u2022 If all four pairs (p^B_k,p^C_k) are equal (either all ++ or all \u2212\u2212), then setting w_i\u2261+ gives x_{ij}=+ and hence each triangle triple is (+++), which is allowed by (1). (By central symmetry, the (\u2212,\u2212) case is covered as well.)\n  \u2022 Otherwise, there exists at least one k with (p^B_k,p^C_k) opposite. Choose w with exactly two + and two \u2212 (Lemma 11). Then all four triangle triples are of type (+\u2212\u2212) up to permutation. By (2) and (3), (+\u2212\u2212) is allowed for both equal and opposite fixed\u2011pairs (using Corollary 9 for the (\u2212,\u2212) and (\u2212,+) subcases). Hence all four Y_k pass, and we obtain an amalgam in H.\u220e\n- Why useful: Reduces the entire |A|=4 decision to verifying only two concrete membership facts: (a) (+\u2212\u2212) \u2208 F(+,+), and (b) (+\u2212\u2212) \u2208 F(+,-). The other two cases follow by Corollary 9.\n\nRemark (Scope of the uniform 2+2\u2212 assignment).\n- The argument of Lemma 12 is specific to |A|=4, where every Y_k sees exactly three of the w_i\u2019s; with 2+2\u2212, every triangle contains a mixed triple, never all three equal. For larger |A| the same fixed 2+2\u2212 choice would not prevent +++ triples on some 3\u2011subsets, so we do not propose it beyond |A|=4. This is fine: by Lemma 2, settling the one\u2011point step for all |A| is sufficient, and we can (and should) handle |A|>4 by the same CSP with its own choices of w.\n\n## Examples and unit checks (to aid the verifier)\n- Opposite case (+++, +\u2212): p=(+,-,+,+,+) has exactly one minus \u21d2 O5 (Lemma 10). Symmetric (---, +\u2212) gives the canonical O5 representative.\n- Equal case (+++, ++): p=(+,+,+,+,+) is C5 \u21d2 allowed; unit test for IsO5.\n- Pattern (+\u2212\u2212): test both F(+,+) and F(+,-). If either fails, archive the specific \u03c4 that maps p to the O5 orbit and note which \u03b5(\u03c4) was used. If both succeed, Lemma 12 resolves |A|=4.\n\n## Obstacles and why a tiny computation is still needed\n- We cannot, by purely pen\u2011and\u2011paper means, certify (+\u2212\u2212) \u2208 F(+,+) and (+\u2212\u2212) \u2208 F(+,-) without unpacking the S5 signed action in detail. However, this is an 8\u2011evaluation task per F and we only need two of them, with a simple IsO5 oracle (Step A in notes.md/output.md). The check is immediate once IsO5 is implemented.\n\n## Next steps (minimal, checkable)\n1) Implement IsO5 via Lemma 6; validate with unit tests: (+,+,+,+,+) non\u2011O5; (+,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212) O5; (+,\u2212,+,\u2212,+) non\u2011O5. Report the orbit size for O5 and closure under the action.\n2) Compute the two key memberships:\n   - Check whether (+\u2212\u2212) \u2208 F(+,+) (i.e., p=(+,+,+,\u2212,\u2212) is non\u2011O5).\n   - Check whether (+\u2212\u2212) \u2208 F(+,-) (i.e., p=(+,\u2212,+,\u2212,\u2212) is non\u2011O5).\n   By Corollary 9 this immediately implies the corresponding statements for F(\u2212,\u2212) and F(\u2212,+).\n3) If both are true, conclude (by Lemma 12) that the |A|=4 one\u2011point amalgamation always succeeds. Together with Lemma 2, this proves that H has the amalgamation property.\n4) If either membership fails, fall back to the 2^6 brute\u2011force CSP solver for |A|=4 (as already outlined) to either find a different satisfying assignment or exhibit a counterexample to AP. In reporting, include the failing (\u03b1_k,\u03b2_k) pattern over k\u2208A and an UNSAT certificate (e.g., list of all 64 assignments with the O5\u2011witnessing Y_k per assignment, or a SAT witness if it exists).\n\n## Additional cleanups and clarifications\n- Symmetry note: Lemma 8 and Corollary 9 (in output.md) justify reducing F\u2011table computations by sign flip: F(\u2212\u03b1,\u2212\u03b2) is obtained from F(\u03b1,\u03b2) by triplewise negation. We do not assume S3\u2011invariance of F(\u03b1,\u03b2) on the last three coordinates; use the fixed coordinate convention when constructing p=(\u03b1,\u03b2,x,y,z).\n- Edge\u2011assignment viewpoint: Lemma 11 makes explicit that the structured ansatz with vertex signs w realizes, on K_4\u2019s triangles, only two S3\u2011types of triples: (+++) (when the three w\u2019s are equal) and (+\u2212\u2212) (when exactly one w differs). This is the core combinatorial mechanism behind Lemma 12.\n\n## Gaps in output.md (to be addressed later; do not edit now)\n- Proposition 3 fixes which two coordinates of p(Y_k) are \u201cmissing c\u201d and \u201cmissing b,\u201d but does not record an explicit convention for ordering the last three coordinates (the vertices of A\\{k}). For reproducibility, a precise convention (e.g., increasing order in the ambient enumeration) should be stated in output.md when the F(\u03b1,\u03b2) tables are finally incorporated.\n- The |A|=3 one\u2011point case is not yet proved in output.md; once IsO5 is implemented and F(+,+), F(+,-) are tabulated, it will follow immediately by listing one allowed triple per (\u03b1,\u03b2).\n\n## Summary of progress\n- Proved Lemma 10 (both all\u2011equal triples forbidden in the opposite\u2011fixed case), sharpening constraints and supplying concrete unit tests.\n- Proved Lemma 11 (a 2+2\u2212 vertex\u2011sign assignment yields (+\u2212\u2212) triples on all four triangles), and Lemma 12 reducing the |A|=4 one\u2011point amalgamation to verifying just two memberships: (+\u2212\u2212)\u2208F(+,+) and (+\u2212\u2212)\u2208F(+,-).\n- Provided a minimal, auditable computational path: implement IsO5, check the two memberships, and conclude AP if both hold; else, perform the already\u2011planned 2^6 brute\u2011force search to decide AP either way.\n- This materially narrows the search space and sets up a decisive final step for the verifier to complete in the next round."
