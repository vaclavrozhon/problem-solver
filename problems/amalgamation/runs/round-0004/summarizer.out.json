This round produced three concrete lemmas: Lemma 10 rules out (+++) and (---) in the opposite\u2011fixed case (F(+,-) and symmetric), Lemma 11 shows a uniform 2+2\u2212 vertex\u2011sign assignment on K_4 forces every triangle triple to be of type (+\u2212\u2212) (up to order), and Lemma 12 reduces the entire |A|=4 one\u2011point amalgamation to two explicit IsO5 membership checks: (+\u2212\u2212)\u2208F(+,+) and (+\u2212\u2212)\u2208F(+,-) (with the other two cases following by symmetry). The round gives a tiny, auditable computational plan: implement IsO5, run two 8\u2011evaluation tests, conclude AP if both pass, otherwise run the planned 2^6 brute\u2011force CSP to find a witness or UNSAT certificate. Unit tests and symmetry clarifications to aid verification are provided. (Files relied on: prover-01.out.json (progress_md); background: notes.md, output.md.)",
  "highlights": [
    "Lemma 10: (+++) and (---) are forbidden in F(+,-) (and by symmetry in F(-,+)), giving two hard exclusions and unit tests for IsO5.",
    "Lemma 11: A global 2+2\u2212 vertex sign assignment on A={1,2,3,4} makes every triangle triple a permutation of (+\u2212\u2212).",
    "Lemma 12: The |A|=4 one\u2011point amalgamation succeeds whenever (+++)\u2208F(+,+) (already true) and (+\u2212\u2212)\u2208F(+,+) and (+\u2212\u2212)\u2208F(+,-).",
    "Reduction: the |A|=4 decision reduces to two concrete membership tests (eight evaluations each) plus an IsO5 oracle.",
    "Computational plan: implement IsO5 (with provided unit tests), check the two patterns; if both hold conclude AP, else run the 2^6 brute\u2011force CSP and report witness/UNSAT certificate."

  "next_questions": [
    "Implement IsO5 and validate with the suggested unit tests (e.g. p=(+,+,+,+,+) non\u2011O5; p=(+,-,-,-,-) O5).",

    "If either membership fails, run the 64\u2011assignment brute\u2011force CSP for |A|=4 and produce either a SAT witness or an explicit UNSAT certificate (list of assignments with O5 witnesses)."
