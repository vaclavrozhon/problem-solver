## Status and focus for this round
- We keep the CSP reduction and one‑point amalgamation framework from output.md and notes.md. The key unresolved item is to decide feasibility of the |A|=4 one‑point step, which determines AP (Lemma 2).
- This round contributes: two concrete, checkable lemmas sharpening the local tables F(α,β); a uniform edge‑assignment strategy on K_4 that reduces the |A|=4 decision to verifying a very small number of membership tests in F; and a tightened computational plan that, if validated, essentially settles AP.

## Ideas and micro‑lemmas (auditable)

Lemma 10 (All‑equal triples in the opposite‑fixed case are O5).
- Statement: For F(+,-), both (+++) and (---) are forbidden (yield O5). By Corollary 9, the symmetric cases for F(−,+) are also forbidden.
- Proof sketch: (+++) with (α,β)=(+,-) gives p=(+,-,+,+,+), which has exactly one minus. There exists τ with ε_i(τ)=−1 for all i (Lemma 8), hence −ε=(+,+,+,+,+). Flipping one coordinate produces exactly the “one discrepancy” pattern, which is in the O5 orbit. Similarly, (---) with (α,β)=(+,-) yields p=(+,-,−,−,−), which is the canonical labeled O5 representative.∎
- Why useful: Gives two hard exclusions in the most constrained case; provides unit tests for IsO5 and for computed F(+,-).

Lemma 11 (Two‑plus two‑minus vertex signs force the triangle triple type (+−−) on all four Y_k).
- Set up: Label A={1,2,3,4}. Choose vertex signs w_i∈{±1} with exactly two + and two −, and set edge variables x_{ij}:=w_i w_j for 1≤i<j≤4 (the structured ansatz).
- Claim: For each k, the triple of variables on Y_k’s three edges (inside A\{k}) is, up to permutation of its three coordinates, of the form (+,−,−).
- Proof: If the missing vertex k is chosen from the + group, the included three vertices contain exactly one + and two −; the three pairwise products are (+·−, +·−, −·−) = (−,−,+), i.e., a permutation of (+,−,−). If k is chosen from the − group, the included set is {+, +, −}, whose pairwise products again form a permutation of (+,−,−).∎
- Why useful: A single global choice (2+2− on vertices) makes every triangle triple equal to (+−−) (up to reordering). If the triple pattern (+−−) is allowed for all four (α_k,β_k), then this assignment simultaneously satisfies all four constraints, yielding the one‑point amalgam.

Lemma 12 (Minimal membership tests suffice to settle the |A|=4 one‑point amalgam via a uniform assignment).
- Let F(α,β)⊆{±1}^3 be as in notes.md (p=(α,β,x,y,z) non‑O5). If the following three membership properties all hold:
  1) (+++) ∈ F(+,+) (already holds: p=(+,+,+,+,+) is C_5),
  2) (+−−) ∈ F(+,+), and by Corollary 9 also (−, +, +) ∈ F(−,−),
  3) (+−−) ∈ F(+,-), and by Corollary 9 also (+−−) ∈ F(−,+),
  then the |A|=4 one‑point amalgamation always succeeds.
- Proof: Distinguish two cases for a given one‑point diagram over A={1,2,3,4}:
  • If all four pairs (p^B_k,p^C_k) are equal (either all ++ or all −−), then setting w_i≡+ gives x_{ij}=+ and hence each triangle triple is (+++), which is allowed by (1). (By central symmetry, the (−,−) case is covered as well.)
  • Otherwise, there exists at least one k with (p^B_k,p^C_k) opposite. Choose w with exactly two + and two − (Lemma 11). Then all four triangle triples are of type (+−−) up to permutation. By (2) and (3), (+−−) is allowed for both equal and opposite fixed‑pairs (using Corollary 9 for the (−,−) and (−,+) subcases). Hence all four Y_k pass, and we obtain an amalgam in H.∎
- Why useful: Reduces the entire |A|=4 decision to verifying only two concrete membership facts: (a) (+−−) ∈ F(+,+), and (b) (+−−) ∈ F(+,-). The other two cases follow by Corollary 9.

Remark (Scope of the uniform 2+2− assignment).
- The argument of Lemma 12 is specific to |A|=4, where every Y_k sees exactly three of the w_i’s; with 2+2−, every triangle contains a mixed triple, never all three equal. For larger |A| the same fixed 2+2− choice would not prevent +++ triples on some 3‑subsets, so we do not propose it beyond |A|=4. This is fine: by Lemma 2, settling the one‑point step for all |A| is sufficient, and we can (and should) handle |A|>4 by the same CSP with its own choices of w.

## Examples and unit checks (to aid the verifier)
- Opposite case (+++, +−): p=(+,-,+,+,+) has exactly one minus ⇒ O5 (Lemma 10). Symmetric (---, +−) gives the canonical O5 representative.
- Equal case (+++, ++): p=(+,+,+,+,+) is C5 ⇒ allowed; unit test for IsO5.
- Pattern (+−−): test both F(+,+) and F(+,-). If either fails, archive the specific τ that maps p to the O5 orbit and note which ε(τ) was used. If both succeed, Lemma 12 resolves |A|=4.

## Obstacles and why a tiny computation is still needed
- We cannot, by purely pen‑and‑paper means, certify (+−−) ∈ F(+,+) and (+−−) ∈ F(+,-) without unpacking the S5 signed action in detail. However, this is an 8‑evaluation task per F and we only need two of them, with a simple IsO5 oracle (Step A in notes.md/output.md). The check is immediate once IsO5 is implemented.

## Next steps (minimal, checkable)
1) Implement IsO5 via Lemma 6; validate with unit tests: (+,+,+,+,+) non‑O5; (+,−,−,−,−) O5; (+,−,+,−,+) non‑O5. Report the orbit size for O5 and closure under the action.
2) Compute the two key memberships:
   - Check whether (+−−) ∈ F(+,+) (i.e., p=(+,+,+,−,−) is non‑O5).
   - Check whether (+−−) ∈ F(+,-) (i.e., p=(+,−,+,−,−) is non‑O5).
   By Corollary 9 this immediately implies the corresponding statements for F(−,−) and F(−,+).
3) If both are true, conclude (by Lemma 12) that the |A|=4 one‑point amalgamation always succeeds. Together with Lemma 2, this proves that H has the amalgamation property.
4) If either membership fails, fall back to the 2^6 brute‑force CSP solver for |A|=4 (as already outlined) to either find a different satisfying assignment or exhibit a counterexample to AP. In reporting, include the failing (α_k,β_k) pattern over k∈A and an UNSAT certificate (e.g., list of all 64 assignments with the O5‑witnessing Y_k per assignment, or a SAT witness if it exists).

## Additional cleanups and clarifications
- Symmetry note: Lemma 8 and Corollary 9 (in output.md) justify reducing F‑table computations by sign flip: F(−α,−β) is obtained from F(α,β) by triplewise negation. We do not assume S3‑invariance of F(α,β) on the last three coordinates; use the fixed coordinate convention when constructing p=(α,β,x,y,z).
- Edge‑assignment viewpoint: Lemma 11 makes explicit that the structured ansatz with vertex signs w realizes, on K_4’s triangles, only two S3‑types of triples: (+++) (when the three w’s are equal) and (+−−) (when exactly one w differs). This is the core combinatorial mechanism behind Lemma 12.

## Gaps in output.md (to be addressed later; do not edit now)
- Proposition 3 fixes which two coordinates of p(Y_k) are “missing c” and “missing b,” but does not record an explicit convention for ordering the last three coordinates (the vertices of A\{k}). For reproducibility, a precise convention (e.g., increasing order in the ambient enumeration) should be stated in output.md when the F(α,β) tables are finally incorporated.
- The |A|=3 one‑point case is not yet proved in output.md; once IsO5 is implemented and F(+,+), F(+,-) are tabulated, it will follow immediately by listing one allowed triple per (α,β).

## Summary of progress
- Proved Lemma 10 (both all‑equal triples forbidden in the opposite‑fixed case), sharpening constraints and supplying concrete unit tests.
- Proved Lemma 11 (a 2+2− vertex‑sign assignment yields (+−−) triples on all four triangles), and Lemma 12 reducing the |A|=4 one‑point amalgamation to verifying just two memberships: (+−−)∈F(+,+) and (+−−)∈F(+,-).
- Provided a minimal, auditable computational path: implement IsO5, check the two memberships, and conclude AP if both hold; else, perform the already‑planned 2^6 brute‑force search to decide AP either way.
- This materially narrows the search space and sets up a decisive final step for the verifier to complete in the next round.
