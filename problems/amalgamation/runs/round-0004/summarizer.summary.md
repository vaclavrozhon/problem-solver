Kept the CSP reduction and one‑point amalgamation framework from output.md/notes.md; the remaining decision is the |A|=4 one‑point step which determines AP. This round produced three concrete lemmas: Lemma 10 rules out (+++) and (---) in the opposite‑fixed case (F(+,-) and symmetric), Lemma 11 shows a uniform 2+2− vertex‑sign assignment on K_4 forces every triangle triple to be of type (+−−) (up to order), and Lemma 12 reduces the entire |A|=4 one‑point amalgamation to two explicit IsO5 membership checks: (+−−)∈F(+,+) and (+−−)∈F(+,-) (with the other two cases following by symmetry). The round gives a tiny, auditable computational plan: implement IsO5, run two 8‑evaluation tests, conclude AP if both pass, otherwise run the planned 2^6 brute‑force CSP to find a witness or UNSAT certificate. Unit tests and symmetry clarifications to aid verification are provided. (Files relied on: prover-01.out.json (progress_md); background: notes.md, output.md.)
