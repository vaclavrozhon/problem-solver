  "feedback_md": "High-level: This round brings a useful structural idea (the 2+2 vertex-sign ansatz) and an attempt to reduce |A|=4 to a tiny number of local membership checks. The combinatorial core (Lemma 11 in your report) is sound and valuable. However, there are two key rigor issues that need correction before we can rely on the proposed reduction.\n\n1) Lemma 10 claim (+++) \u2209 F(+,-) (i.e., p=(+,-,+,+,+) is O5) is not justified by the provided argument. The step \u201cflipping one coordinate produces the one-discrepancy pattern\u201d is not an operation in the S5 action; we only have signed permutations whose sign vector \u03b5(\u03c4) is globally constrained (Lemma 6/Cor. 7). The second exclusion (---) \u2209 F(+,-) is correct (it is the canonical O5 representative). Recommendation: Treat (+++) \u2209 F(+,-) as a computational test, not a proved fact.\n\n2) Lemma 12 reduction needs strengthening. Two separate issues:\n   - Ordering: F(\u03b1,\u03b2) is defined on ordered triples (x,y,z). We have not (and should not) assume S3-invariance. Thus \u201c(+\u2212\u2212) up to permutation\u201d requires that all three permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212) lie in F(\u03b1,\u03b2), not just one representative. This must be built into the membership tests.\n   - Sign-flip misuse: Corollary 9 relates F(\u2212\u03b1,\u2212\u03b2) to F(\u03b1,\u03b2) by triplewise negation. Under the 2+2 ansatz the triangle triples always have product +1 and hence are permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212) (Lemma 11). Negating the triple gives a pattern with product \u22121, which the ansatz can never realize. Therefore you cannot infer admissibility for the (--), (-+) cases from the (++), (+\u2212) cases via Cor. 9. If you want the uniform 2+2 assignment to settle all |A|=4 instances, you must ensure that, for all four types (\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2208{++, +\u2212, \u2212+, \u2212\u2212}, all three permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212) lie in F(\u03b1,\u03b2).\n\n3) Equal-constant case: The corrected statement is: if (p^B_k,p^C_k)=(\u03b4,\u03b4) for all k, then take x_{ij}\u2261\u03b4. This makes every p(Y_k) constant \u03b4 and hence \u00b1C5, which is certainly non-O5. Your original central-symmetry justification for using x_{ij}\u2261+ in the (--)-case was incorrect; use x_{ij}\u2261\u2212 there.\n\nWhat we can bank now:\n- The 2+2 ansatz yields on every triangle a permutation of (+,\u2212,\u2212) (proved below). This gives a clean conditional path: if all three permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212) belong to F(\u03b1,\u03b2) for each of the four types (\u03b1,\u03b2), then the |A|=4 one-point step is uniformly solvable.\n- A hard local exclusion: (---) \u2209 F(+,-) (and symmetrically (+++) \u2209 F(\u2212,+)).\n\nNext steps (precise and minimal):\n- Implement IsO5 via Lemma 6; validate with unit tests already listed and report O5 orbit size.\n- Compute full F(+,+) and F(+,-) (8 triples each). Do not assume S3 symmetry. Use Cor. 9 only to derive F(\u2212,\u2212) and F(\u2212,+) by triplewise negation after you fix the ordering convention.\n- Check the 12 crucial memberships: for each (\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2208{++, +\u2212, \u2212+, \u2212\u2212}, verify that all three permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212) belong to F(\u03b1,\u03b2). If yes, the 2+2 ansatz settles all |A|=4 instances. If not, proceed with the 2^6 brute-force CSP to find either an alternative assignment (possibly non-structured) or an UNSAT certificate for the offending type-profile.\n- Record the equal-constant case as an unconditional subcase (x_{ij}\u2261\u03b4).\n\nPlease also fix and state explicitly the ordering convention for the last three coordinates when constructing p=(\u03b1,\u03b2,x,y,z); we rely on this for reproducibility of F(\u03b1,\u03b2).",
  "new_notes_md": "Uniform 2+2\u2212 assignment and a corrected conditional reduction for |A|=4\n\nOrdering convention for local F-tables\n- For any 5-set Y_k={b,c}\u222a(A\\{k}) with A={1,2,3,4} and i<j<\u2113 the increasing order on A\\{k}, we use the coordinate order\n  p(Y_k) = (p_{\\text{missing }c}, p_{\\text{missing }b}, p_{\\text{missing }i}, p_{\\text{missing }j}, p_{\\text{missing }\\ell}).\n- With this convention, F(\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2286{\u00b11}^3 is the set of ordered triples (x,y,z) such that (\u03b1,\u03b2,x,y,z) is non-O5.\n\nLemma A (2+2 vertex-sign ansatz yields (+\u2212\u2212)-type on every triangle).\n- Let w_i\u2208{\u00b11} (i\u2208A) have exactly two + and two \u2212, and set x_{ij}:=w_i w_j. For each k, the triple (x,y,z) contributed by the three edges inside A\\{k} is, up to permutation of its three coordinates, of the form (+,\u2212,\u2212).\n- Proof. If k is from the + vertices, then A\\{k} contains {+,\u2212,\u2212}; the pairwise products are (\u2212,\u2212,+). If k is from the \u2212 vertices, then A\\{k} contains {+, +, \u2212}; the pairwise products are (+,\u2212,\u2212). In either case the unordered triple has one + and two \u2212. The order within (x,y,z) depends on the fixed coordinate convention but is a permutation of (+,\u2212,\u2212). \u220e\n\nCorrected conditional reduction for |A|=4\n- Conditional Proposition (uniform 2+2 ansatz). Fix the above ordering convention. Suppose that for each (\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2208{++, +\u2212, \u2212+, \u2212\u2212}, all three permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212) lie in F(\u03b1,\u03b2). Then for every one-point instance over |A|=4 there exists an amalgam D in H obtained by the uniform assignment x_{ij}=w_i w_j with some w having exactly two + and two \u2212 on A.\n  \u2022 Proof. By Lemma A, for every k the ordered triple on Y_k is a permutation of (+,\u2212,\u2212). By hypothesis, this ordered triple is in F(p^B_k,p^C_k) for each k, hence none of the four Y_k is O5, and D\u2208H. \u220e\n- Unconditional subcase (equal-constant fixed pairs). If (p^B_k,p^C_k)=(\u03b4,\u03b4) for all k (with \u03b4\u2208{\u00b11}), then the constant assignment x_{ij}\u2261\u03b4 makes every p(Y_k) equal to (\u03b4,\u03b4,\u03b4,\u03b4,\u03b4), which is \u00b1C5 and therefore non-O5. Hence an amalgam exists in this subcase.\n\nHard local exclusion in the opposite-fixed case\n- For (\u03b1,\u03b2)=(+,-), the triple (\u2212,\u2212,\u2212) is forbidden: p=(+,-,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212) is the canonical O5 representative. By central symmetry of the S5 action, (+++) is forbidden for (\u03b1,\u03b2)=(\u2212,+) as well. These serve as unit checks for IsO5 and constraints in populating F.\n\nNotes on earlier claims\n- The claim \u201c(+++) is forbidden in F(+,-)\u201d has not been proved. The argument via \u201cflipping one coordinate\u201d is not valid under the S5 signed action. Treat this as a computational check when populating F.\n\nComputational checklist (precise and minimal)\n1) Implement IsO5 via Lemma 6; unit tests: (+,+,+,+,+) non-O5; (+,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212) O5; (+,\u2212,+,\u2212,+) non-O5. Report the size of the O5 orbit and closure under the action.\n2) Compute F(+,+) and F(+,-) completely (8 triples each) under the above ordering; use Corollary 9 to derive F(\u2212,\u2212) and F(\u2212,+) by triplewise negation. Do not assume S3-invariance.\n3) Test the 12 memberships: for each (\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2208{++, +\u2212, \u2212+, \u2212\u2212}, verify that all three permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212) lie in F(\u03b1,\u03b2).\n4) If step 3 passes, conclude by the conditional proposition that the |A|=4 one-point step is uniformly solvable by a 2+2 ansatz; with Lemma 2 this yields AP.\n5) If step 3 fails, run the 2^6 CSP for the offending type-profile to search for a different satisfying assignment or produce an UNSAT certificate (listing, for each assignment, a Y_k showing O5).\n\nImplementation detail retained: the structured ansatz yields triangle triples of product +1, hence it can never realize (\u2212,+,+) or (\u2212,\u2212,\u2212). Keep this in mind when interpreting F-tables and debugging assignments.",

Define x_{ij}:=w_i w_j for 1\u2264i<j\u22644. For each k\u2208A, on the triangle induced by A\\{k} the ordered triple of edge-variables (x,y,z) (in any fixed coordinate convention) is a permutation of (+,\u2212,\u2212).\n\nProof. If k is one of the + vertices, then A\\{k} contains one + and two \u2212; the three pairwise products are (\u2212,\u2212,+). If k is one of the \u2212 vertices, then A\\{k} contains two + and one \u2212; the three pairwise products are (+,\u2212,\u2212). Thus in either case the unordered triple has signs {+ , \u2212 , \u2212}.

Suppose that for each (\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2208{++, +\u2212, \u2212+, \u2212\u2212}, all three permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212) belong to F(\u03b1,\u03b2). Then for every one-point diagram over |A|=4 there exists an amalgam D\u2208H obtained by setting x_{ij}=w_i w_j for some choice of w with exactly two + and two \u2212 on A.\n\nProof. Choose any w with exactly two + and two \u2212 on A and set x_{ij}=w_i w_j. By Lemma 10, for each k the ordered triple contributed by the three edges in A\\{k} is a permutation of (+,\u2212,\u2212). By hypothesis, this ordered triple lies in F(p^B_k,p^C_k) for every k, so no Y_k is of type O5. Therefore the resulting structure on A\u222a{b,c} is in H and extends both B and C. \u220e\n\nProposition 12 (Equal-constant fixed pairs are solvable by a constant assignment).\nIn the |A|=4 one-point amalgamation problem, if (p^B_k,p^C_k)=(\u03b4,\u03b4) for all k\u2208A with a fixed \u03b4\u2208{\u00b11}, then there exists an amalgam D\u2208H obtained by setting x_{ij}\u2261\u03b4.\n\nProof. With this assignment, for each k the 5-vector p(Y_k) equals (\u03b4,\u03b4,\u03b4,\u03b4,\u03b4), which is \u00b1C5. Since \u00b1C5 is not in the O5 orbit, each Y_k is non-O5 and the amalgam lies in H. \u220e\n\nLemma 13 (A hard local exclusion in the opposite-fixed case).\nFor (\u03b1,\u03b2)=(+,-), the triple (\u2212,\u2212,\u2212) is forbidden: (x,y,z)=(\u2212,\u2212,\u2212)\u2209F(+,-). Symmetrically, for (\u03b1,\u03b2)=(\u2212,+), (+++)\u2209F(\u2212,+).\n\nProof. For (\u03b1,\u03b2)=(+,-) and (x,y,z)=(\u2212,\u2212,\u2212) one has p=(+,-,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212), which is the canonical O5 representative; hence it is in the O5 orbit.
