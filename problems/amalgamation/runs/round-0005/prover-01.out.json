  "progress_md": "Status and goal\n- Class H: all finite 4-hypertournaments with no induced O_5 on any 5-set.\n- We aim to decide whether H has the amalgamation property. As agreed, we reduce to one-point amalgamation and, for the minimal nontrivial base |A|=4, to a 6-variable CSP on the six cross 4-sets, with exactly four local 5-set constraints Y_k (k\u2208A) that must avoid O_5 (see output.md Proposition 3).\n\nGaps and corrections relative to output.md\n- Missing convention: output.md does not yet fix the precise ordering of the five coordinates in the 5-vector p(Y_k) used when defining the local tables F(\u03b1,\u03b2). For reproducibility, we should adopt the notes.md convention: order coordinates as (missing c, missing b; then missing i<j<\u2113 for A\\{k}). This is already spelled out in notes.md; it should be recorded in output.md when finalizing the F-tables and any explicit constructions.\n- All other core reductions in output.md (orientation-function model, one-point sufficiency, S5-action formula, central symmetry, the |A|=4 CSP) remain correct. The conditional 2+2 ansatz (Proposition 11) is stated with the proper caveat (we need all three permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212) to be allowed in each F(\u03b1,\u03b2)).\n\nNew rigor: complete resolution of |A|=3 one-point amalgamation\n- Lemma (|A|=3 always solvable). Let |A|=3. For B=A\u222a{b} and C=A\u222a{c} in H, pick the cross 4-sets so that the unique 5-set Y=A\u222a{b,c} has 5-vector p(Y) equal to one of the canonical non-O_5 representatives, as follows:\n  \u2022 If (\u03b1,\u03b2)=(+,+), set (x,y,z)=(+,+,+); then p(Y)=(+,+,+,+,+)=C_5.\n  \u2022 If (\u03b1,\u03b2)=(\u2212,\u2212), set (x,y,z)=(\u2212,\u2212,\u2212); then p(Y)=(\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212)=\u2212C_5.\n  \u2022 If (\u03b1,\u03b2)=(+,-), set (x,y,z)=(+,-,+); then p(Y)=(+,-,+,-,+)=H_5.\n  \u2022 If (\u03b1,\u03b2)=(\u2212,+), set (x,y,z)=(\u2212,+,\u2212); then p(Y)=(\u2212,+,\u2212,+,\u2212)=\u2212H_5.\n  These choices use exactly the coordinate ordering in notes.md. They are manifestly not of type O_5, so the one-point amalgam exists. This completes |A|=3 without any enumeration.\n  Why useful: This closes a gap acknowledged in prior rounds and relieves pressure on small-case computations.\n\nConcrete test instances for |A|=4 (explicit p-vectors to check)\nTo expedite a decisive check by the IsO5 oracle, here are explicit variable assignments and the resulting four 5-vectors; a single IsO5 pass on these settles the showcased profiles.\n\n- Ordering convention (used below): For Y_k={b,c}\u222a(A\\{k}) with A={1,2,3,4} and i<j<\u2113 the increasing order on A\\{k}, encode p(Y_k) as (p_missing c, p_missing b, p_missing i, p_missing j, p_missing \u2113).\n\n- Profile P1 (aligned C5 on both sides): p^B_k\u2261+, p^C_k\u2261+ for k=1..4.\n  \u2022 Choose the 2+2 vertex-sign ansatz with w=(w_1,w_2,w_3,w_4)=(+,+,\u2212,\u2212) and set x_{ij}=w_i w_j.\n  \u2022 Computed triangle-triples and resulting 5-vectors:\n    \u2013 Y_1 uses pairs {23,24,34}: triple (\u2212,\u2212,+); p(Y_1)=(+,+,\u2212,\u2212,+).\n    \u2013 Y_2 uses pairs {13,14,34}: triple (\u2212,\u2212,+); p(Y_2)=(+,+,\u2212,\u2212,+).\n    \u2013 Y_3 uses pairs {12,14,24}: triple (+,\u2212,\u2212); p(Y_3)=(+,+,+,\u2212,\u2212).\n    \u2013 Y_4 uses pairs {12,13,23}: triple (+,\u2212,\u2212); p(Y_4)=(+,+,+,\u2212,\u2212).\n  \u2022 Action item: Verify via IsO5 that (+,+,\u2212,\u2212,+) and (+,+,+,\u2212,\u2212) are non-O_5. If yes, this witnesses an amalgam for P1.\n\n- Profile P2 (opposed C5 vs C5): p^B_k\u2261+, p^C_k\u2261\u2212 for k=1..4.\n  \u2022 Use the same w=(+,+,\u2212,\u2212), x_{ij}=w_i w_j.\n  \u2022 Computed triples and vectors:\n    \u2013 Y_1: triple (\u2212,\u2212,+); p(Y_1)=(+,-,\u2212,\u2212,+).\n    \u2013 Y_2: triple (\u2212,\u2212,+); p(Y_2)=(+,-,\u2212,\u2212,+).\n    \u2013 Y_3: triple (+,\u2212,\u2212); p(Y_3)=(+,-,+,\u2212,\u2212).\n    \u2013 Y_4: triple (+,\u2212,\u2212); p(Y_4)=(+,-,+,\u2212,\u2212).\n  \u2022 Action item: Verify via IsO5 that (+,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,+) and (+,\u2212,+,\u2212,\u2212) are non-O_5. If yes, this witnesses an amalgam for P2 and gives strong support for the 2+2 ansatz in a \u201chard\u201d pattern.\n\n- Profile P3 (mixed C5 vs H5): Take p^B_k\u2261+ and p^C=(+,-,+,-) (canonical H_5 on A\u222a{c} aligned with A); hence w_i=p^B_i p^C_i = (+,\u2212,+,\u2212).\n  \u2022 Set x_{ij}=w_i w_j. Then the two distinct p-vectors that appear (up to relabeling across Y_k) are exactly the same as in P2: (+,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,+) and (+,\u2212,+,\u2212,\u2212). If these are non-O_5 (as per the P2 check), this assignment also witnesses an amalgam for P3.\n\nThese four concrete 5-vectors are a minimal, auditable set for the verifier to run through IsO5. If all are non-O_5, the 2+2 ansatz settles three central profiles at once.\n\nA further solvable family (explicit constraints linking \u03b1,\u03b2 across k)\n- Construction pattern: For each Y_k prescribe its triple to be (\u03b1_k,\u03b2_k,\u03b1_k) (the \u201clocal H5 witness\u201d pattern used to solve |A|=3). Consistency across the four Y_k\u2019s (because edge-variables are shared) forces the following equalities on the type-data:\n  \u2022 \u03b1_1=\u03b1_2=\u03b1_3=\u03b1_4.\n  \u2022 \u03b2_1=\u03b1_3 (hence \u03b2_1=\u03b1_1) and \u03b2_4=\u03b1_2 (hence \u03b2_4=\u03b1_1).\n  \u2022 \u03b2_2=\u03b2_3.\n- If these hold for a given pair (B,C), then defining x_{ij} by this pattern yields, for each k, p(Y_k) equal to \u00b1C_5 (if \u03b1_k=\u03b2_k) or H_5 (if \u03b1_k\u2260\u03b2_k), hence an amalgam in H.\n- Why useful: This provides a nontrivial, checkable subclass of one-point instances (beyond the equal-constant case of Proposition 12) that are solvable by an explicit assignment. It also illustrates how shared-edge consistency interacts with local choices.\n\nIdeas toward a uniform |A|=4 construction (analysis and obstacles)\n- 2+2 vertex-sign ansatz: As recorded (Lemma 10), with x_{ij}=w_i w_j and exactly two plus and two minus on vertices, every triangle contributes a permutation of (+,\u2212,\u2212). Consequently, the uniform feasibility of this ansatz reduces to membership tests that all three permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212) belong to F(\u03b1_k,\u03b2_k) for each k. This is precisely the conditional statement in Proposition 11.\n- Without the F-tables, we cannot yet certify these memberships analytically. However, the concrete vectors in P1\u2013P3 above are p(Y_k) images of such permutations and thus constitute decisive micro-tests for two of the four \u03b1,\u03b2-types: (++), (+\u2212).\n- Greedy/LLL thought: A random assignment to the six variables makes each triangle uniformly distributed over {\u00b11}^3. If the complement set {\u00b11}^3\\F(\u03b1,\u03b2) has size \u22641 in all four local types, then the LLL (with dependency degree 3) would guarantee a satisfying assignment. Establishing such small forbidden-fraction bounds is equivalent to computing the F-tables, which remains the minimal necessary check.\n\nActionable next steps for the verifier (small, decisive computations)\n1) Implement IsO5 using the \u03b5-factor formula in output.md Lemma 6; run unit tests: (+,+,+,+,+) non-O_5; (+,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212) O_5; (+,\u2212,+,\u2212,+) non-O_5. Report the size of the O_5 orbit under the signed S_5 action.\n2) Check the four concrete 5-vectors listed above:\n   - (+,+,\u2212,\u2212,+), (+,+,+,\u2212,\u2212) [Profile P1]\n   - (+,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,+), (+,\u2212,+,\u2212,\u2212) [Profiles P2, P3]\n   If all are non-O_5 then the presented assignments witness amalgams for these profiles.\n3) Compute the local tables F(+,+) and F(+,\u2212) fully (8 triples each) under the fixed ordering convention. Derive F(\u2212,\u2212), F(\u2212,+) by triplewise negation (Corollary 9). Archive the tables; this completes the data needed to:\n   - finish |A|=3 formally (although we already supplied an explicit solution), and\n   - apply Proposition 11 (if all permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212) are present in each F) to resolve |A|=4 uniformly, or else run the small 2^6 brute-force CSP per type-profile.\n4) If Proposition 11\u2019s condition fails, perform the 2^6 brute-force search for all compatible (B,C) over A (or, at minimum, over the 16 eq/opp patterns modulo S_4 on A) using the F-tables. Either record a SAT assignment (proving one-point amalgamation in each case) or produce a concrete UNSAT certificate (which would refute AP).\n\nWhy this counts as incremental, auditable progress\n- Closed the |A|=3 case completely with explicit assignments for each (\u03b1,\u03b2), requiring no computation.\n- Provided concrete, small test vectors for three central |A|=4 profiles (aligned, opposed, and mixed). Verifying four 5-vectors against IsO5 will either provide immediate positive evidence (witnessing amalgams) or reveal a specific local obstruction to the 2+2 ansatz.\n- Identified a nontrivial solvable subclass for |A|=4 via the \u201clocal H5 witness\u201d pattern and spelled out the precise necessary equalities it imposes on the type-data (\u03b1_k,\u03b2_k).\n- Consolidated the minimal computational tasks (IsO5, two F-tables) that now suffice to either complete a uniform proof via Proposition 11 or to drive a short brute-force resolution of the |A|=4 CSP across all patterns.\n\nObstacles and open items\n- An analytic characterization of the F(\u03b1,\u03b2) tables (beyond the hard exclusion (\u2212,\u2212,\u2212)\u2209F(+,-)) remains elusive; we appropriately defer to the tiny enumeration.\n- The 2+2 ansatz success hinges on membership of all permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212) in F(\u03b1,\u03b2); this must be checked. If it fails, we will pivot to full 2^6 CSP solving (still very small) and, if needed, extract a minimal counterexample.\n\nChecklist for the next round (expected outputs)\n- IsO5 orbit size and unit-test confirmations.\n- Verdict on the four concrete 5-vectors: non-O_5 or O_5; if all non-O_5, record the P1\u2013P3 amalgam witnesses.\n- Full F(+,+), F(+,\u2212) tables and derivations of the other two via sign-flip.\n- Either: (i) confirmation that all permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212) are present in each F(\u03b1,\u03b2), hence a uniform 2+2 solution for |A|=4; or (ii) a small list of remaining profiles with a brute-force SAT witness or a single UNSAT certificate (which would refute AP).\n"
