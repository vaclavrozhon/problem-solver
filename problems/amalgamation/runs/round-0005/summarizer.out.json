  "summary_md": "Round goal: decide amalgamation for class H by reducing to one-point amalgamation; the hard case is |A|=4, a 6-variable CSP with four local 5-set constraints avoiding O_5. Corrections: fix the 5-coordinate ordering per notes.md for reproducibility. Main progress: closed |A|=3 with explicit assignments for all (\u03b1,\u03b2) cases giving p(Y) \u2208 {C5, \u2212C5, H5, \u2212H5}. For |A|=4 provided concrete 2+2-ansatz instances (P1,P2,P3) using w=(+,+,\u2212,\u2212) and x_{ij}=w_iw_j that produce a minimal audit set of four 5-vectors to test by IsO5: (+,+,\u2212,\u2212,+), (+,+,+,\u2212,\u2212), (+,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,+), (+,\u2212,+,\u2212,\u2212). Action plan: implement IsO5, test these vectors, compute F(+,+) and F(+,\u2212) (derive others by sign flip), and check whether all permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212) lie in each F to validate the uniform 2+2 solution; otherwise run the 2^6 brute-force CSP. Verifier verdict: success. Citations: prover-01.out.json; output.md; notes.md.",
