Status and goal
- Class H: all finite 4-hypertournaments with no induced O_5 on any 5-set.
- We aim to decide whether H has the amalgamation property. As agreed, we reduce to one-point amalgamation and, for the minimal nontrivial base |A|=4, to a 6-variable CSP on the six cross 4-sets, with exactly four local 5-set constraints Y_k (k∈A) that must avoid O_5 (see output.md Proposition 3).

Gaps and corrections relative to output.md
- Missing convention: output.md does not yet fix the precise ordering of the five coordinates in the 5-vector p(Y_k) used when defining the local tables F(α,β). For reproducibility, we should adopt the notes.md convention: order coordinates as (missing c, missing b; then missing i<j<ℓ for A\{k}). This is already spelled out in notes.md; it should be recorded in output.md when finalizing the F-tables and any explicit constructions.
- All other core reductions in output.md (orientation-function model, one-point sufficiency, S5-action formula, central symmetry, the |A|=4 CSP) remain correct. The conditional 2+2 ansatz (Proposition 11) is stated with the proper caveat (we need all three permutations of (+,−,−) to be allowed in each F(α,β)).

New rigor: complete resolution of |A|=3 one-point amalgamation
- Lemma (|A|=3 always solvable). Let |A|=3. For B=A∪{b} and C=A∪{c} in H, pick the cross 4-sets so that the unique 5-set Y=A∪{b,c} has 5-vector p(Y) equal to one of the canonical non-O_5 representatives, as follows:
  • If (α,β)=(+,+), set (x,y,z)=(+,+,+); then p(Y)=(+,+,+,+,+)=C_5.
  • If (α,β)=(−,−), set (x,y,z)=(−,−,−); then p(Y)=(−,−,−,−,−)=−C_5.
  • If (α,β)=(+,-), set (x,y,z)=(+,-,+); then p(Y)=(+,-,+,-,+)=H_5.
  • If (α,β)=(−,+), set (x,y,z)=(−,+,−); then p(Y)=(−,+,−,+,−)=−H_5.
  These choices use exactly the coordinate ordering in notes.md. They are manifestly not of type O_5, so the one-point amalgam exists. This completes |A|=3 without any enumeration.
  Why useful: This closes a gap acknowledged in prior rounds and relieves pressure on small-case computations.

Concrete test instances for |A|=4 (explicit p-vectors to check)
To expedite a decisive check by the IsO5 oracle, here are explicit variable assignments and the resulting four 5-vectors; a single IsO5 pass on these settles the showcased profiles.

- Ordering convention (used below): For Y_k={b,c}∪(A\{k}) with A={1,2,3,4} and i<j<ℓ the increasing order on A\{k}, encode p(Y_k) as (p_missing c, p_missing b, p_missing i, p_missing j, p_missing ℓ).

- Profile P1 (aligned C5 on both sides): p^B_k≡+, p^C_k≡+ for k=1..4.
  • Choose the 2+2 vertex-sign ansatz with w=(w_1,w_2,w_3,w_4)=(+,+,−,−) and set x_{ij}=w_i w_j.
  • Computed triangle-triples and resulting 5-vectors:
    – Y_1 uses pairs {23,24,34}: triple (−,−,+); p(Y_1)=(+,+,−,−,+).
    – Y_2 uses pairs {13,14,34}: triple (−,−,+); p(Y_2)=(+,+,−,−,+).
    – Y_3 uses pairs {12,14,24}: triple (+,−,−); p(Y_3)=(+,+,+,−,−).
    – Y_4 uses pairs {12,13,23}: triple (+,−,−); p(Y_4)=(+,+,+,−,−).
  • Action item: Verify via IsO5 that (+,+,−,−,+) and (+,+,+,−,−) are non-O_5. If yes, this witnesses an amalgam for P1.

- Profile P2 (opposed C5 vs C5): p^B_k≡+, p^C_k≡− for k=1..4.
  • Use the same w=(+,+,−,−), x_{ij}=w_i w_j.
  • Computed triples and vectors:
    – Y_1: triple (−,−,+); p(Y_1)=(+,-,−,−,+).
    – Y_2: triple (−,−,+); p(Y_2)=(+,-,−,−,+).
    – Y_3: triple (+,−,−); p(Y_3)=(+,-,+,−,−).
    – Y_4: triple (+,−,−); p(Y_4)=(+,-,+,−,−).
  • Action item: Verify via IsO5 that (+,−,−,−,+) and (+,−,+,−,−) are non-O_5. If yes, this witnesses an amalgam for P2 and gives strong support for the 2+2 ansatz in a “hard” pattern.

- Profile P3 (mixed C5 vs H5): Take p^B_k≡+ and p^C=(+,-,+,-) (canonical H_5 on A∪{c} aligned with A); hence w_i=p^B_i p^C_i = (+,−,+,−).
  • Set x_{ij}=w_i w_j. Then the two distinct p-vectors that appear (up to relabeling across Y_k) are exactly the same as in P2: (+,−,−,−,+) and (+,−,+,−,−). If these are non-O_5 (as per the P2 check), this assignment also witnesses an amalgam for P3.

These four concrete 5-vectors are a minimal, auditable set for the verifier to run through IsO5. If all are non-O_5, the 2+2 ansatz settles three central profiles at once.

A further solvable family (explicit constraints linking α,β across k)
- Construction pattern: For each Y_k prescribe its triple to be (α_k,β_k,α_k) (the “local H5 witness” pattern used to solve |A|=3). Consistency across the four Y_k’s (because edge-variables are shared) forces the following equalities on the type-data:
  • α_1=α_2=α_3=α_4.
  • β_1=α_3 (hence β_1=α_1) and β_4=α_2 (hence β_4=α_1).
  • β_2=β_3.
- If these hold for a given pair (B,C), then defining x_{ij} by this pattern yields, for each k, p(Y_k) equal to ±C_5 (if α_k=β_k) or H_5 (if α_k≠β_k), hence an amalgam in H.
- Why useful: This provides a nontrivial, checkable subclass of one-point instances (beyond the equal-constant case of Proposition 12) that are solvable by an explicit assignment. It also illustrates how shared-edge consistency interacts with local choices.

Ideas toward a uniform |A|=4 construction (analysis and obstacles)
- 2+2 vertex-sign ansatz: As recorded (Lemma 10), with x_{ij}=w_i w_j and exactly two plus and two minus on vertices, every triangle contributes a permutation of (+,−,−). Consequently, the uniform feasibility of this ansatz reduces to membership tests that all three permutations of (+,−,−) belong to F(α_k,β_k) for each k. This is precisely the conditional statement in Proposition 11.
- Without the F-tables, we cannot yet certify these memberships analytically. However, the concrete vectors in P1–P3 above are p(Y_k) images of such permutations and thus constitute decisive micro-tests for two of the four α,β-types: (++), (+−).
- Greedy/LLL thought: A random assignment to the six variables makes each triangle uniformly distributed over {±1}^3. If the complement set {±1}^3\F(α,β) has size ≤1 in all four local types, then the LLL (with dependency degree 3) would guarantee a satisfying assignment. Establishing such small forbidden-fraction bounds is equivalent to computing the F-tables, which remains the minimal necessary check.

Actionable next steps for the verifier (small, decisive computations)
1) Implement IsO5 using the ε-factor formula in output.md Lemma 6; run unit tests: (+,+,+,+,+) non-O_5; (+,−,−,−,−) O_5; (+,−,+,−,+) non-O_5. Report the size of the O_5 orbit under the signed S_5 action.
2) Check the four concrete 5-vectors listed above:
   - (+,+,−,−,+), (+,+,+,−,−) [Profile P1]
   - (+,−,−,−,+), (+,−,+,−,−) [Profiles P2, P3]
   If all are non-O_5 then the presented assignments witness amalgams for these profiles.
3) Compute the local tables F(+,+) and F(+,−) fully (8 triples each) under the fixed ordering convention. Derive F(−,−), F(−,+) by triplewise negation (Corollary 9). Archive the tables; this completes the data needed to:
   - finish |A|=3 formally (although we already supplied an explicit solution), and
   - apply Proposition 11 (if all permutations of (+,−,−) are present in each F) to resolve |A|=4 uniformly, or else run the small 2^6 brute-force CSP per type-profile.
4) If Proposition 11’s condition fails, perform the 2^6 brute-force search for all compatible (B,C) over A (or, at minimum, over the 16 eq/opp patterns modulo S_4 on A) using the F-tables. Either record a SAT assignment (proving one-point amalgamation in each case) or produce a concrete UNSAT certificate (which would refute AP).

Why this counts as incremental, auditable progress
- Closed the |A|=3 case completely with explicit assignments for each (α,β), requiring no computation.
- Provided concrete, small test vectors for three central |A|=4 profiles (aligned, opposed, and mixed). Verifying four 5-vectors against IsO5 will either provide immediate positive evidence (witnessing amalgams) or reveal a specific local obstruction to the 2+2 ansatz.
- Identified a nontrivial solvable subclass for |A|=4 via the “local H5 witness” pattern and spelled out the precise necessary equalities it imposes on the type-data (α_k,β_k).
- Consolidated the minimal computational tasks (IsO5, two F-tables) that now suffice to either complete a uniform proof via Proposition 11 or to drive a short brute-force resolution of the |A|=4 CSP across all patterns.

Obstacles and open items
- An analytic characterization of the F(α,β) tables (beyond the hard exclusion (−,−,−)∉F(+,-)) remains elusive; we appropriately defer to the tiny enumeration.
- The 2+2 ansatz success hinges on membership of all permutations of (+,−,−) in F(α,β); this must be checked. If it fails, we will pivot to full 2^6 CSP solving (still very small) and, if needed, extract a minimal counterexample.

Checklist for the next round (expected outputs)
- IsO5 orbit size and unit-test confirmations.
- Verdict on the four concrete 5-vectors: non-O_5 or O_5; if all non-O_5, record the P1–P3 amalgam witnesses.
- Full F(+,+), F(+,−) tables and derivations of the other two via sign-flip.
- Either: (i) confirmation that all permutations of (+,−,−) are present in each F(α,β), hence a uniform 2+2 solution for |A|=4; or (ii) a small list of remaining profiles with a brute-force SAT witness or a single UNSAT certificate (which would refute AP).
