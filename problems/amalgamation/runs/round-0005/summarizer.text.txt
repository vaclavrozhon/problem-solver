  "summary_md": "Round goal: decide amalgamation for class H by reducing to one-point amalgamation; the hard case is |A|=4, a 6-variable CSP with four local 5-set constraints avoiding O_5. Corrections: fix the 5-coordinate ordering per notes.md for reproducibility. Main progress: closed |A|=3 with explicit assignments for all (α,β) cases giving p(Y) ∈ {C5, −C5, H5, −H5}. For |A|=4 provided concrete 2+2-ansatz instances (P1,P2,P3) using w=(+,+,−,−) and x_{ij}=w_iw_j that produce a minimal audit set of four 5-vectors to test by IsO5: (+,+,−,−,+), (+,+,+,−,−), (+,−,−,−,+), (+,−,+,−,−). Action plan: implement IsO5, test these vectors, compute F(+,+) and F(+,−) (derive others by sign flip), and check whether all permutations of (+,−,−) lie in each F to validate the uniform 2+2 solution; otherwise run the 2^6 brute-force CSP. Verifier verdict: success. Citations: prover-01.out.json; output.md; notes.md.",

    "|A|=3 is fully resolved: explicit choices yield p(Y)=C5, −C5, H5, −H5 for the four (α,β) cases, so one-point amalgams always exist for |A|=3.",
    "Fixed coordinate-ordering convention (from notes.md) for the 5-vector encoding — required for reproducible F-table computation.",
    "Concrete 2+2-ansatz instances (w=(+,+,−,−)) give the four 5-vectors to check: (+,+,−,−,+), (+,+,+,−,−), (+,−,−,−,+), (+,−,+,−,−). A single IsO5 pass on these is decisive for P1–P3.",
    "Identified a solvable subclass via the 'local H5 witness' pattern (triples (α_k,β_k,α_k)); this forces equalities among α_k,β_k and yields ±C5 or H5 per Y_k."

    "Run IsO5 (ε-factor test) on the four listed 5-vectors and report whether each is non-O_5 (also report O_5 orbit size and unit-test results).",
    "Compute full F(+,+) and F(+,−) tables under the fixed ordering (derive F(−,−), F(−,+) by sign flip); then check if all three permutations of (+,−,−) lie in each F(α,β) (Proposition 11 condition).",
    "If the 2+2 condition fails, run the 2^6 brute-force CSP (or the 16 pattern representatives modulo S_4) and produce either SAT assignments witnessing amalgams or a minimal UNSAT certificate."
