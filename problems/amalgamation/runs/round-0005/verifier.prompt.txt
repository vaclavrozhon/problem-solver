--- SYSTEM ---
You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md and output.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers
- notes.md (summary so far)
- output.md (rigorously proven results so far)

Guidelines:
- notes.md: should be a readable running log of interesting work. Prefer appending. Replace only if old notes are clearly misleading. Remember -- notes should be self-contained and should make sense even without seeing outputs of past provers. 
- output.md: should be concise and rigorous. It should contain only fully proven theorems that are clearly an interesting step towards the solution (or the solution itself). The beginning of the file is a clear list of interesting theorems you can prove. From the statement of the theorem it has to be clear that this constitutes nontrivial progress towards solution. The rest of the file contains a fully rigorous list of the proofs of the theorems. Keep only proven theorems with clear proofs. If a statement is flawed and you cannot fix it, remove it from output.md and instead add it to notes.md with explanation.
- Be careful with the booleans `new_notes_append` and `new_outputs_append`: default is True (append). Use False only when deliberately rewriting everything.

Tasks:
1) Audit rigor: identify unjustified steps, false statements, missing lemmas; produce minimal counterexamples.
2) Triage value: separate genuine progress from noise.
3) Guide next steps: propose what provers should try next.

[{"prover_id": "01", "progress_md": "Status and goal\n- Class H: all finite 4-hypertournaments with no induced O_5 on any 5-set.\n- We aim to decide whether H has the amalgamation property. As agreed, we reduce to one-point amalgamation and, for the minimal nontrivial base |A|=4, to a 6-variable CSP on the six cross 4-sets, with exactly four local 5-set constraints Y_k (k\u2208A) that must avoid O_5 (see output.md Proposition 3).\n\nGaps and corrections relative to output.md\n- Missing convention: output.md does not yet fix the precise ordering of the five coordinates in the 5-vector p(Y_k) used when defining the local tables F(\u03b1,\u03b2). For reproducibility, we should adopt the notes.md convention: order coordinates as (missing c, missing b; then missing i<j<\u2113 for A\\{k}). This is already spelled out in notes.md; it should be recorded in output.md when finalizing the F-tables and any explicit constructions.\n- All other core reductions in output.md (orientation-function model, one-point sufficiency, S5-action formula, central symmetry, the |A|=4 CSP) remain correct. The conditional 2+2 ansatz (Proposition 11) is stated with the proper caveat (we need all three permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212) to be allowed in each F(\u03b1,\u03b2)).\n\nNew rigor: complete resolution of |A|=3 one-point amalgamation\n- Lemma (|A|=3 always solvable). Let |A|=3. For B=A\u222a{b} and C=A\u222a{c} in H, pick the cross 4-sets so that the unique 5-set Y=A\u222a{b,c} has 5-vector p(Y) equal to one of the canonical non-O_5 representatives, as follows:\n  \u2022 If (\u03b1,\u03b2)=(+,+), set (x,y,z)=(+,+,+); then p(Y)=(+,+,+,+,+)=C_5.\n  \u2022 If (\u03b1,\u03b2)=(\u2212,\u2212), set (x,y,z)=(\u2212,\u2212,\u2212); then p(Y)=(\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212)=\u2212C_5.\n  \u2022 If (\u03b1,\u03b2)=(+,-), set (x,y,z)=(+,-,+); then p(Y)=(+,-,+,-,+)=H_5.\n  \u2022 If (\u03b1,\u03b2)=(\u2212,+), set (x,y,z)=(\u2212,+,\u2212); then p(Y)=(\u2212,+,\u2212,+,\u2212)=\u2212H_5.\n  These choices use exactly the coordinate ordering in notes.md. They are manifestly not of type O_5, so the one-point amalgam exists. This completes |A|=3 without any enumeration.\n  Why useful: This closes a gap acknowledged in prior rounds and relieves pressure on small-case computations.\n\nConcrete test instances for |A|=4 (explicit p-vectors to check)\nTo expedite a decisive check by the IsO5 oracle, here are explicit variable assignments and the resulting four 5-vectors; a single IsO5 pass on these settles the showcased profiles.\n\n- Ordering convention (used below): For Y_k={b,c}\u222a(A\\{k}) with A={1,2,3,4} and i<j<\u2113 the increasing order on A\\{k}, encode p(Y_k) as (p_missing c, p_missing b, p_missing i, p_missing j, p_missing \u2113).\n\n- Profile P1 (aligned C5 on both sides): p^B_k\u2261+, p^C_k\u2261+ for k=1..4.\n  \u2022 Choose the 2+2 vertex-sign ansatz with w=(w_1,w_2,w_3,w_4)=(+,+,\u2212,\u2212) and set x_{ij}=w_i w_j.\n  \u2022 Computed triangle-triples and resulting 5-vectors:\n    \u2013 Y_1 uses pairs {23,24,34}: triple (\u2212,\u2212,+); p(Y_1)=(+,+,\u2212,\u2212,+).\n    \u2013 Y_2 uses pairs {13,14,34}: triple (\u2212,\u2212,+); p(Y_2)=(+,+,\u2212,\u2212,+).\n    \u2013 Y_3 uses pairs {12,14,24}: triple (+,\u2212,\u2212); p(Y_3)=(+,+,+,\u2212,\u2212).\n    \u2013 Y_4 uses pairs {12,13,23}: triple (+,\u2212,\u2212); p(Y_4)=(+,+,+,\u2212,\u2212).\n  \u2022 Action item: Verify via IsO5 that (+,+,\u2212,\u2212,+) and (+,+,+,\u2212,\u2212) are non-O_5. If yes, this witnesses an amalgam for P1.\n\n- Profile P2 (opposed C5 vs C5): p^B_k\u2261+, p^C_k\u2261\u2212 for k=1..4.\n  \u2022 Use the same w=(+,+,\u2212,\u2212), x_{ij}=w_i w_j.\n  \u2022 Computed triples and vectors:\n    \u2013 Y_1: triple (\u2212,\u2212,+); p(Y_1)=(+,-,\u2212,\u2212,+).\n    \u2013 Y_2: triple (\u2212,\u2212,+); p(Y_2)=(+,-,\u2212,\u2212,+).\n    \u2013 Y_3: triple (+,\u2212,\u2212); p(Y_3)=(+,-,+,\u2212,\u2212).\n    \u2013 Y_4: triple (+,\u2212,\u2212); p(Y_4)=(+,-,+,\u2212,\u2212).\n  \u2022 Action item: Verify via IsO5 that (+,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,+) and (+,\u2212,+,\u2212,\u2212) are non-O_5. If yes, this witnesses an amalgam for P2 and gives strong support for the 2+2 ansatz in a \u201chard\u201d pattern.\n\n- Profile P3 (mixed C5 vs H5): Take p^B_k\u2261+ and p^C=(+,-,+,-) (canonical H_5 on A\u222a{c} aligned with A); hence w_i=p^B_i p^C_i = (+,\u2212,+,\u2212).\n  \u2022 Set x_{ij}=w_i w_j. Then the two distinct p-vectors that appear (up to relabeling across Y_k) are exactly the same as in P2: (+,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,+) and (+,\u2212,+,\u2212,\u2212). If these are non-O_5 (as per the P2 check), this assignment also witnesses an amalgam for P3.\n\nThese four concrete 5-vectors are a minimal, auditable set for the verifier to run through IsO5. If all are non-O_5, the 2+2 ansatz settles three central profiles at once.\n\nA further solvable family (explicit constraints linking \u03b1,\u03b2 across k)\n- Construction pattern: For each Y_k prescribe its triple to be (\u03b1_k,\u03b2_k,\u03b1_k) (the \u201clocal H5 witness\u201d pattern used to solve |A|=3). Consistency across the four Y_k\u2019s (because edge-variables are shared) forces the following equalities on the type-data:\n  \u2022 \u03b1_1=\u03b1_2=\u03b1_3=\u03b1_4.\n  \u2022 \u03b2_1=\u03b1_3 (hence \u03b2_1=\u03b1_1) and \u03b2_4=\u03b1_2 (hence \u03b2_4=\u03b1_1).\n  \u2022 \u03b2_2=\u03b2_3.\n- If these hold for a given pair (B,C), then defining x_{ij} by this pattern yields, for each k, p(Y_k) equal to \u00b1C_5 (if \u03b1_k=\u03b2_k) or H_5 (if \u03b1_k\u2260\u03b2_k), hence an amalgam in H.\n- Why useful: This provides a nontrivial, checkable subclass of one-point instances (beyond the equal-constant case of Proposition 12) that are solvable by an explicit assignment. It also illustrates how shared-edge consistency interacts with local choices.\n\nIdeas toward a uniform |A|=4 construction (analysis and obstacles)\n- 2+2 vertex-sign ansatz: As recorded (Lemma 10), with x_{ij}=w_i w_j and exactly two plus and two minus on vertices, every triangle contributes a permutation of (+,\u2212,\u2212). Consequently, the uniform feasibility of this ansatz reduces to membership tests that all three permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212) belong to F(\u03b1_k,\u03b2_k) for each k. This is precisely the conditional statement in Proposition 11.\n- Without the F-tables, we cannot yet certify these memberships analytically. However, the concrete vectors in P1\u2013P3 above are p(Y_k) images of such permutations and thus constitute decisive micro-tests for two of the four \u03b1,\u03b2-types: (++), (+\u2212).\n- Greedy/LLL thought: A random assignment to the six variables makes each triangle uniformly distributed over {\u00b11}^3. If the complement set {\u00b11}^3\\F(\u03b1,\u03b2) has size \u22641 in all four local types, then the LLL (with dependency degree 3) would guarantee a satisfying assignment. Establishing such small forbidden-fraction bounds is equivalent to computing the F-tables, which remains the minimal necessary check.\n\nActionable next steps for the verifier (small, decisive computations)\n1) Implement IsO5 using the \u03b5-factor formula in output.md Lemma 6; run unit tests: (+,+,+,+,+) non-O_5; (+,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212) O_5; (+,\u2212,+,\u2212,+) non-O_5. Report the size of the O_5 orbit under the signed S_5 action.\n2) Check the four concrete 5-vectors listed above:\n   - (+,+,\u2212,\u2212,+), (+,+,+,\u2212,\u2212) [Profile P1]\n   - (+,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,+), (+,\u2212,+,\u2212,\u2212) [Profiles P2, P3]\n   If all are non-O_5 then the presented assignments witness amalgams for these profiles.\n3) Compute the local tables F(+,+) and F(+,\u2212) fully (8 triples each) under the fixed ordering convention. Derive F(\u2212,\u2212), F(\u2212,+) by triplewise negation (Corollary 9). Archive the tables; this completes the data needed to:\n   - finish |A|=3 formally (although we already supplied an explicit solution), and\n   - apply Proposition 11 (if all permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212) are present in each F) to resolve |A|=4 uniformly, or else run the small 2^6 brute-force CSP per type-profile.\n4) If Proposition 11\u2019s condition fails, perform the 2^6 brute-force search for all compatible (B,C) over A (or, at minimum, over the 16 eq/opp patterns modulo S_4 on A) using the F-tables. Either record a SAT assignment (proving one-point amalgamation in each case) or produce a concrete UNSAT certificate (which would refute AP).\n\nWhy this counts as incremental, auditable progress\n- Closed the |A|=3 case completely with explicit assignments for each (\u03b1,\u03b2), requiring no computation.\n- Provided concrete, small test vectors for three central |A|=4 profiles (aligned, opposed, and mixed). Verifying four 5-vectors against IsO5 will either provide immediate positive evidence (witnessing amalgams) or reveal a specific local obstruction to the 2+2 ansatz.\n- Identified a nontrivial solvable subclass for |A|=4 via the \u201clocal H5 witness\u201d pattern and spelled out the precise necessary equalities it imposes on the type-data (\u03b1_k,\u03b2_k).\n- Consolidated the minimal computational tasks (IsO5, two F-tables) that now suffice to either complete a uniform proof via Proposition 11 or to drive a short brute-force resolution of the |A|=4 CSP across all patterns.\n\nObstacles and open items\n- An analytic characterization of the F(\u03b1,\u03b2) tables (beyond the hard exclusion (\u2212,\u2212,\u2212)\u2209F(+,-)) remains elusive; we appropriately defer to the tiny enumeration.\n- The 2+2 ansatz success hinges on membership of all permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212) in F(\u03b1,\u03b2); this must be checked. If it fails, we will pivot to full 2^6 CSP solving (still very small) and, if needed, extract a minimal counterexample.\n\nChecklist for the next round (expected outputs)\n- IsO5 orbit size and unit-test confirmations.\n- Verdict on the four concrete 5-vectors: non-O_5 or O_5; if all non-O_5, record the P1\u2013P3 amalgam witnesses.\n- Full F(+,+), F(+,\u2212) tables and derivations of the other two via sign-flip.\n- Either: (i) confirmation that all permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212) are present in each F(\u03b1,\u03b2), hence a uniform 2+2 solution for |A|=4; or (ii) a small list of remaining profiles with a brute-force SAT witness or a single UNSAT certificate (which would refute AP).\n"}]

Set‑up and notations (agreed baseline)
- 4‑hypertournament on finite V: equivalent to a function f:[V]^4→{±1}. For an ordered 4‑tuple (x1,x2,x3,x4) with underlying set S, we declare (x1,x2,x3,x4)∈R iff the permutation from the increasing ordering of S to (x1,…,x4) has sign equal to f(S). This satisfies (i) tuples have distinct entries, (ii) closure under even permutations, (iii) exactly one of (x1,x2,x3,x4) and (x2,x1,x3,x4) lies in R.
- For a 5‑set X, define its 5‑vector p(X)∈{±1}^X by p_x:=f(X\{x}). Isomorphisms act by p↦(ε_i(τ)·p_{τ^{-1}(i)}) with ε_i(τ)=sign of τ restricted to X\{τ^{-1}(i)}. The three isomorphism types on 5 points are denoted C5, H5, O5. For computation we may use representatives C5=(+,+,+,+,+), O5=(+,-,-,-,-), H5=(+,-,+,-,+); the orbit relation is determined by the above action (not by raw counts of pluses).

One‑point amalgamation reduction
- AP for H (class of finite 4‑hypertournaments with no induced O5) reduces to the one‑point case: Given A∈H, B=A∪{b}∈H, C=A∪{c}∈H with B∩C=A, existence of D on A∪{b,c} in H extending B and C implies full AP by iteratively adding the vertices of C\A to B.

CSP for the minimal nontrivial one‑point case |A|=4
- Fix A={1,2,3,4}, b=5, c=6. The only undetermined f‑values are the six cross 4‑sets X_{ij}={i,j,5,6} (1≤i<j≤4). Let variables x_{ij}:=f(X_{ij})∈{±1}.
- The only potentially new 5‑sets are Y_k:={5,6}∪(A\{k}) for k∈{1,2,3,4}. For each k, p(Y_k) has two fixed coordinates: p missing 6 equals p^B_k:=f_B({5}∪(A\{k})), and p missing 5 equals p^C_k:=f_C({6}∪(A\{k})); and three variable coordinates drawn from {x_{ij}} on the three pairs inside A\{k}:
  • Y_1 depends on {x_{23},x_{24},x_{34}}
  • Y_2 depends on {x_{13},x_{14},x_{34}}
  • Y_3 depends on {x_{12},x_{14},x_{24}}
  • Y_4 depends on {x_{12},x_{13},x_{23}}.
- Constraint: For each k, p(Y_k) must not lie in the O5‑orbit. This is the complete constraint system for the one‑point amalgam over A of size 4.

Base sizes |A|≤2 and |A|=3
- |A|≤2: There are no 5‑sets Y; any assignment to cross 4‑sets works, so one‑point amalgamation always succeeds.
- |A|=3: There is exactly one 5‑set Y=A∪{b,c}, with two fixed coordinates (those missing b and c) and three unknowns (those missing each a∈A). We expect (and plan to verify computationally) that for every (α,β)∈{±1}^2 at least one of the 8 assignments to the three unknowns avoids the O5 orbit. This settles one‑point amalgamation at size 3 once verified.

Switching: what it does and what it does not
- For ε:V→{±1}, define f^ε(S):=(∏_{v∈S}ε(v))·f(S). Then f^ε encodes another 4‑hypertournament.
- Caution: For a fixed 5‑set X, switching at a vertex v∈X flips the four coordinates of p(X) corresponding to the 4‑sets that contain v and leaves the coordinate “missing v” unchanged. This can change the 5‑type: e.g., (+,-,-,-,-) (an O5 representative) switches at the ‘+’ vertex to (+,+,+,+,+) (a C5 representative). Thus switching is not a valid normalization trick for fixed one‑point data (B,C) in H.

Computational plan (to settle |A|=3 and |A|=4)
- Step A: Compute the O5 orbit via the S5 action above; implement IsO5(p).
- Step B (|A|=3): For each (α,β), enumerate the 8 triples, test IsO5, and record that at least one choice avoids O5.
- Step C (|A|=4): Enumerate compatible (B,C) (both of type C5 or H5, agreeing on f(A)), form p^B_k,p^C_k (k=1..4), and brute‑force the 2^6 choices of x_{ij}, rejecting any assignment for which some Y_k is O5. Record either a counterexample or certify all cases pass.
- Precompute F(α,β)⊆{±1}^3: the allowed triples for a 5‑set with given two fixed coordinates. Then the |A|=4 CSP checks membership of the four triangle‑triples in F(p^B_k,p^C_k).

Constructive ansatz to test
- Try x_{ij}=w_iw_j with w_i:=p^B_i·p^C_i for i∈A. For T={i,j,k} this gives a triple (w_iw_j,w_iw_k,w_jw_k) of product +1. If this never yields O5 for any (p^B_k,p^C_k), it provides a uniform construction for all |A| (worth testing; not proved).
Addendum: explicit S5 action, corrections, and computation plan

1) Explicit ε-formula for the S5 action (implementation aid)
For τ ∈ S5 and i ∈ {1,…,5}, write j := τ^{-1}(i) and define
c_j(τ) := |{k<j : τ(k) > τ(j)}| + |{k>j : τ(k) < τ(j)}|.
Then the sign multiplier in the action p′_i = ε_i(τ)·p_{τ^{-1}(i)} equals
ε_i(τ) = sgn(τ)·(−1)^{c_j(τ)}.
Sketch of justification: Let τ′ be the induced bijection from [5]\{j} to [5]\{i}. Its inversion count is inv(τ′) = inv(τ) − c_j(τ) because the inversions of τ decompose into those not involving j (which biject with the inversions of τ′) and those involving j (counted by c_j). Hence sgn(τ′) = (−1)^{inv(τ′)} = (−1)^{inv(τ)−c_j} = sgn(τ)·(−1)^{c_j}. By definition ε_i(τ) = sgn(τ′). A immediate corollary is the product identity ∏_{i=1}^5 ε_i(τ) = sgn(τ), since Σ_j c_j(τ) = 2·inv(τ).

Practical note: This eliminates ambiguity about ε and supports a robust IsO5 enumerator.

2) Correction to the “fully aligned” claim
The statement “If p^B_k = p^C_k for all k then setting all x_{ij}=δ makes p(Y_k) constant δ for all k” is false unless the common pattern (p^B_k)_{k∈A} is itself constant with value δ. Counterexample: take p^B=p^C=(+,+,−,+) and δ=+. Then for k=3 the fixed coordinates are (−,−) while the three variables are +, so p(Y_3) is not constant. A correct (weaker) statement is: if p^B_k = p^C_k = δ for all k, then x_{ij}≡δ makes every p(Y_k) constant δ, hence non-O5.

3) F(α,β) tables: compute all four cases
Define F(α,β) ⊆ {±1}^3 as the set of triples (x,y,z) for which p=(α,β,x,y,z) is non-O5. Do not assume F(+,+)=F(−,−) or F(+,-)=F(−,+) a priori; compute all four cases. This is an 8×4=32-evaluation task. Record each F(α,β) explicitly along with any observed symmetries (e.g., invariance under permuting x,y,z).

Consequence: |A|=3 reduces to checking that for each (α,β) there exists at least one triple in F(α,β). Archive one such triple per case.

4) |A|=4 CSP protocol (profiles and ansatz)
- Use the already-recorded CSP with variables x_{ij} on the six edges of K4 and four constraints Y_k. For any concrete pair (B,C) over A with B∩C=A and both omitting O5, determine the four pairs (p^B_k,p^C_k) and require the corresponding triangle-triple to lie in F(p^B_k,p^C_k).
- Profiles to test early:
  • P1: p^B≡+, p^C≡+. The corrected alignment lemma (constant case) gives the assignment x_{ij}≡+.
  • P2: p^B≡+, p^C≡−. Try the perfect-matching assignment x_{12}=x_{34}=+, others −; check all four Y_k via IsO5.
  • P3: p^B≡+, p^C drawn from an H5 labeling consistent on A; try ansatz x_{ij}=w_i w_j with w_i=p^B_i p^C_i.
  • P4: both sides H5 aligned on A; by the corrected alignment lemma with δ=+, x_{ij}≡+ works if the common 4-bit pattern on A is constant +.
- Constructive ansatz: x_{ij}:=w_i w_j where w_i:=p^B_i p^C_i. For T={i,j,k}, the triple is (w_i w_j, w_i w_k, w_j w_k) with product +1. Test this uniformly across enumerated cases; if it always avoids O5, it suggests a uniform construction for general |A|.

5) Unit tests for IsO5
- p=(+,+,+,+,+) should classify non-O5; p=(+,−,−,−,−) should classify O5; p=(+,−,+,−,+) should classify non-O5 (H5). Also verify that for a transposition τ, ∏_i p′_i flips sign (product identity) and that orbit membership is invariant under the action.

6) Checklist for the next round
- Implement IsO5 with the ε-formula; report the size of the O5 orbit found by enumeration.
- Compute and list F(α,β) for all four cases; confirm |A|=3.
- Run the |A|=4 CSP on P1–P4 first, then extend to representatives modulo S4 on A; archive satisfying/unsatisfying assignments.
- Report whether the ansatz x_{ij}=w_i w_j succeeds in all tested instances.
Additional clarifications, small lemmas, and symmetry for the 5-vector orbit

1) Semantics of the fixed bits p^B_k and p^C_k (|A|=4)
For B on A∪{b} and k∈A, define p^B_k:=f_B({b}∪(A\{k})). On the 5-set A∪{b}, the 5-vector p has entries p_x=f((A∪{b})\{x}). Thus for k∈A, p^B_k coincides with the coordinate “missing k” of p on A∪{b}: it records whether the increasing 4-tuple on {b}∪(A\{k}) is in R_B. Analogously p^C_k is the coordinate “missing k” of the 5-vector on A∪{c}.

2) Necessary local exclusions in the opposite-fixed case (rigorous justification)
- With (α,β,x,y,z)=(+;−;−,−,−) we obtain the canonical O5 representative; hence this triple is forbidden for (α,β)=(+,-).
- By central symmetry of the O5 orbit (see 4) below), (−;+;+,+,+) is also O5; hence forbidden for (α,β)=(−,+).
These give immediate unit tests for any IsO5 implementation and constraints for F(+,-) and F(−,+).

3) Edge/triangle viewpoint and the structured ansatz
- Place the six variables x_{ij} on the edges of K4 on A. The constraint Y_k uses the triangle on T=A\{k}.
- Structured ansatz: pick w_i∈{±1} on the vertices and set x_{ij}:=w_i w_j. For any triangle {i,j,k}, the triple (w_iw_j,w_iw_k,w_jw_k) has product +1, realizing exactly (+++),(+−−),(−+−),(−−+).

4) Central symmetry of the O5 orbit and a consequence for F(α,β)
There exists τ∈S5, e.g. τ=(13), with ε_i(τ)=−1 for all i (check via Lemma 6: c_j(τ) is even for every j and sgn(τ)=−1). Hence for any 5-vector p, p∈O5 iff −p∈O5. As a consequence, for the local tables F(α,β)⊆{±1}^3 (defined by p=(α,β,x,y,z) non-O5), one has
F(−α,−β) = { (−x,−y,−z) : (x,y,z)∈F(α,β) }.
Therefore it suffices to compute F(+,+) and F(+,-); the other two cases follow by triplewise negation. Do not assume any further symmetries (e.g., permutations of x,y,z or F(+,-)=F(−,+)) without verification.

5) On classifying |A|=4 instances
The constraint at each k depends on the ordered pair (p^B_k,p^C_k)∈{++,−−,+−,−+}. Reduction to the pure eq/opp pattern E={k: p^B_k=p^C_k} is insufficient unless one proves F(+,+)=F(−,−) and F(+,-)=F(−,+). Use the full type-vector in {++,−−,+−,−+}^A. By 4), it is enough to compute and store F(+,+), F(+,-), and infer the other two by negation.

6) Implementation checklist (precise conventions)
- Fix, once and for all, an ordering of the five vertices of each Y_k with the first two positions corresponding to the coordinates “missing c” and “missing b”, respectively, and the last three to the vertices of A\{k} in increasing order. Use the same convention for constructing p=(α,β,x,y,z) when populating F(α,β).
- Implement IsO5 via Lemma 6. Unit tests: (+,+,+,+,+) is non-O5; (+,−,−,−,−) is O5; (+,−,+,−,+) is non-O5. Report the orbit size and verify closure under the action.
- Compute F(+,+), F(+,-); obtain F(−,−), F(−,+) by triplewise negation. Conclude |A|=3 by listing one admissible triple for each (α,β).
- For |A|=4, enumerate realizable type-vectors from actual pairs (B,C) (both C5/H5, agreeing on A), and brute-force 2^6 assignments to x_{ij}. Archive SAT witnesses or UNSAT certificates. Test the ansatz x_{ij}=w_i w_j with w_i=p^B_i p^C_i across the same cases.

These additions lock down the symmetry that underlies Claim N1, correct the eq/opp reduction, and make the forthcoming computations unambiguous and reusable.
Uniform 2+2− assignment and a corrected conditional reduction for |A|=4

Ordering convention for local F-tables
- For any 5-set Y_k={b,c}∪(A\{k}) with A={1,2,3,4} and i<j<ℓ the increasing order on A\{k}, we use the coordinate order
  p(Y_k) = (p_{\text{missing }c}, p_{\text{missing }b}, p_{\text{missing }i}, p_{\text{missing }j}, p_{\text{missing }\ell}).
- With this convention, F(α,β)⊆{±1}^3 is the set of ordered triples (x,y,z) such that (α,β,x,y,z) is non-O5.

Lemma A (2+2 vertex-sign ansatz yields (+−−)-type on every triangle).
- Let w_i∈{±1} (i∈A) have exactly two + and two −, and set x_{ij}:=w_i w_j. For each k, the triple (x,y,z) contributed by the three edges inside A\{k} is, up to permutation of its three coordinates, of the form (+,−,−).
- Proof. If k is from the + vertices, then A\{k} contains {+,−,−}; the pairwise products are (−,−,+). If k is from the − vertices, then A\{k} contains {+, +, −}; the pairwise products are (+,−,−). In either case the unordered triple has one + and two −. The order within (x,y,z) depends on the fixed coordinate convention but is a permutation of (+,−,−). ∎

Corrected conditional reduction for |A|=4
- Conditional Proposition (uniform 2+2 ansatz). Fix the above ordering convention. Suppose that for each (α,β)∈{++, +−, −+, −−}, all three permutations of (+,−,−) lie in F(α,β). Then for every one-point instance over |A|=4 there exists an amalgam D in H obtained by the uniform assignment x_{ij}=w_i w_j with some w having exactly two + and two − on A.
  • Proof. By Lemma A, for every k the ordered triple on Y_k is a permutation of (+,−,−). By hypothesis, this ordered triple is in F(p^B_k,p^C_k) for each k, hence none of the four Y_k is O5, and D∈H. ∎
- Unconditional subcase (equal-constant fixed pairs). If (p^B_k,p^C_k)=(δ,δ) for all k (with δ∈{±1}), then the constant assignment x_{ij}≡δ makes every p(Y_k) equal to (δ,δ,δ,δ,δ), which is ±C5 and therefore non-O5. Hence an amalgam exists in this subcase.

Hard local exclusion in the opposite-fixed case
- For (α,β)=(+,-), the triple (−,−,−) is forbidden: p=(+,-,−,−,−) is the canonical O5 representative. By central symmetry of the S5 action, (+++) is forbidden for (α,β)=(−,+) as well. These serve as unit checks for IsO5 and constraints in populating F.

Notes on earlier claims
- The claim “(+++) is forbidden in F(+,-)” has not been proved. The argument via “flipping one coordinate” is not valid under the S5 signed action. Treat this as a computational check when populating F.

Computational checklist (precise and minimal)
1) Implement IsO5 via Lemma 6; unit tests: (+,+,+,+,+) non-O5; (+,−,−,−,−) O5; (+,−,+,−,+) non-O5. Report the size of the O5 orbit and closure under the action.
2) Compute F(+,+) and F(+,-) completely (8 triples each) under the above ordering; use Corollary 9 to derive F(−,−) and F(−,+) by triplewise negation. Do not assume S3-invariance.
3) Test the 12 memberships: for each (α,β)∈{++, +−, −+, −−}, verify that all three permutations of (+,−,−) lie in F(α,β).
4) If step 3 passes, conclude by the conditional proposition that the |A|=4 one-point step is uniformly solvable by a 2+2 ansatz; with Lemma 2 this yields AP.
5) If step 3 fails, run the 2^6 CSP for the offending type-profile to search for a different satisfying assignment or produce an UNSAT certificate (listing, for each assignment, a Y_k showing O5).

Implementation detail retained: the structured ansatz yields triangle triples of product +1, hence it can never realize (−,+,+) or (−,−,−). Keep this in mind when interpreting F-tables and debugging assignments.

Current output.md (if any):
Proposition 1 (Orientation function model).
For a finite set V, giving a 4‑hypertournament structure (V,R) satisfying: (i) all tuples in R have distinct entries; (ii) R is closed under even permutations of coordinates; (iii) for every 4‑tuple of distinct vertices (x1,x2,x3,x4), exactly one of (x1,x2,x3,x4) and (x2,x1,x3,x4) lies in R; is equivalent to giving an arbitrary function f:[V]^4→{±1}.
Proof. Given f, declare (x1,x2,x3,x4)∈R iff the permutation from the increasing ordering of S={x1,x2,x3,x4} to (x1,…,x4) has sign equal to f(S). This satisfies (i)–(iii) by construction. Conversely, given R with (i)–(iii), fix any 4‑set S and any increasing ordering s of S. By (iii), exactly one of s and its swap lies in R; define f(S)=+1 if s∈R and f(S)=−1 otherwise. By (ii) and (iii), membership of any ordered tuple from S depends only on the parity relative to s, so f is well defined and recovers R. ∎

Lemma 2 (One‑point amalgamation suffices for AP in H).
Let H be the class of finite 4‑hypertournaments omitting O5. Suppose that whenever A∈H and B=A∪{b}∈H and C=A∪{c}∈H with B∩C=A, there exists D∈H on A∪{b,c} extending both B and C. Then H has the amalgamation property.
Proof. Given B0,B1∈H over A, enumerate C\A as c1,…,ck and set A0:=A. Inductively, amalgamate Bi with Ai∪{ci} over Ai to obtain Bi+1 on Ai+1:=Ai∪{ci}. At each step, by hypothesis, all 5‑sets involving the new vertex ci avoid O5, and previously constructed parts are unchanged. After k steps we obtain an amalgam D∈H of B0 and C over A. ∎

Proposition 3 (CSP formulation of the |A|=4 one‑point step).
Let A={1,2,3,4}, b, c new. Given B on A∪{b} and C on A∪{c} in H that agree on A, any amalgam D on A∪{b,c} is determined on new 4‑sets by the six values x_{ij}:=f({i,j,b,c}) (1≤i<j≤4). The only new 5‑sets are Y_k:={b,c}∪(A\{k}) for k=1,2,3,4. Writing p^B_k:=f_B({b}∪(A\{k})) and p^C_k:=f_C({c}∪(A\{k})), the 5‑vector p(Y_k) has two fixed coordinates (missing c gives p^B_k; missing b gives p^C_k) and three coordinates equal to the x_{ij} for {i,j}⊂A\{k}. D∈H iff for each k, p(Y_k) is not in the O5 orbit.
Proof. All 4‑sets contained in B or C are already fixed. The only 4‑sets not contained in B or C are precisely the six X_{ij}={i,j,b,c}. The only new 5‑subsets of A∪{b,c} (relative to B and C) are those that contain both b and c; there are exactly four, the Y_k. Their p‑vectors depend on the listed values. Avoidance of O5 on all 5‑sets is thus equivalent to the stated four constraints. ∎

Corollary 4 (Trivial one‑point cases |A|≤2).
If |A|≤2, then one‑point amalgamation always succeeds in H.
Proof. When |A|≤2 there are no 3‑subsets of A, hence no 5‑sets of the form {b,c}∪T with T⊂A of size 3. Thus there are no new 5‑set constraints; any assignment to cross 4‑sets yields an amalgam in H. ∎

Fact 5 (Switching yields a 4‑hypertournament but may change 5‑types).
For ε:V→{±1}, define f^ε(S):=(∏_{v∈S}ε(v))·f(S). Then f^ε encodes a 4‑hypertournament. However, for a fixed 5‑set X, switching at v∈X flips the four coordinates of p(X) corresponding to 4‑sets containing v and leaves the coordinate “missing v” unchanged; this can change the isomorphism type on X (e.g., an O5 representative (+,-,-,-,-) switches at its ‘+’ vertex to (+,+,+,+,+), a C5 representative). ∎
Lemma 6 (Explicit formula for the S5 action on 5-vectors).
Let X be a 5-set equipped with an increasing labeling {1,2,3,4,5}. For τ∈S5 and i∈{1,…,5}, write j:=τ^{-1}(i) and define
c_j(τ) := |{k<j : τ(k) > τ(j)}| + |{k>j : τ(k) < τ(j)}|.
In the isomorphism action on p∈{±1}^X given by p′_i = ε_i(τ)·p_{τ^{-1}(i)}, the sign factor is
ε_i(τ) = sgn(τ)·(−1)^{c_j(τ)}.

Proof. Let τ′ be the induced bijection from [5]\{j} to [5]\{i}, obtained by deleting position j in the domain and value i in the codomain. By definition, ε_i(τ)=sgn(τ′). The inversions of τ split into two disjoint families: those not involving j (which correspond bijectively to inversions of τ′) and those involving j, whose number is c_j(τ) by definition. Hence inv(τ)=inv(τ′)+c_j(τ), so sgn(τ)= (−1)^{inv(τ)} = (−1)^{inv(τ′)+c_j(τ)} = sgn(τ′)·(−1)^{c_j(τ)} = ε_i(τ)·(−1)^{c_j(τ)}. Rearranging gives the claimed formula. ∎

Corollary 7 (Product identity for ε-factors).
For τ∈S5, one has ∏_{i=1}^5 ε_i(τ) = sgn(τ).

Proof. Using ε_i(τ) = sgn(τ)·(−1)^{c_{τ^{-1}(i)}(τ)} and the fact that each inversion contributes 1 to c_a and 1 to c_b, we have Σ_{j=1}^5 c_j(τ) = 2·inv(τ). Therefore ∏_{i=1}^5 ε_i(τ) = sgn(τ)^5 · (−1)^{Σ_j c_j(τ)} = sgn(τ)·(−1)^{2·inv(τ)} = sgn(τ). ∎
Lemma 8 (Central symmetry of the O5 orbit).
There exists τ∈S5 with ε_i(τ)=−1 for all i. In particular, for any 5-vector p one has p∈O5 if and only if −p∈O5. Thus the O5 orbit is closed under global sign reversal.

Proof. Take τ=(13) in one-line notation [3,2,1,4,5]. By Lemma 6, for j:=τ^{-1}(i), ε_i(τ)=sgn(τ)·(−1)^{c_j(τ)}. A direct count gives c_1(τ)=c_2(τ)=c_3(τ)=2 and c_4(τ)=c_5(τ)=0, so c_j(τ) is even for all j. Since sgn(τ)=−1, we get ε_i(τ)=−1 for every i. If q is in the O5 orbit, then so is R_τ(q)=−q∘τ^{−1}. As σ ranges over S5, the set {−R_σ(e1)} equals {R_{τσ}(e1):σ∈S5}, hence −O5=O5. ∎

Corollary 9 (Sign-flip symmetry for local tables F).
For F(α,β)⊆{±1}^3 defined by: (x,y,z)∈F(α,β) iff (α,β,x,y,z) is non-O5, one has
F(−α,−β) = { (−x,−y,−z) : (x,y,z)∈F(α,β) }.

Proof. (α,β,x,y,z) is non-O5 iff its global negation (−α,−β,−x,−y,−z) is non-O5 by Lemma 8. This is exactly the stated correspondence. ∎
Lemma 10 (2+2 vertex signs induce (+−−)-type on every triangle).
Let A={1,2,3,4} and choose w_i∈{±1} with exactly two plus and two minus. Define x_{ij}:=w_i w_j for 1≤i<j≤4. For each k∈A, on the triangle induced by A\{k} the ordered triple of edge-variables (x,y,z) (in any fixed coordinate convention) is a permutation of (+,−,−).

Proof. If k is one of the + vertices, then A\{k} contains one + and two −; the three pairwise products are (−,−,+). If k is one of the − vertices, then A\{k} contains two + and one −; the three pairwise products are (+,−,−). Thus in either case the unordered triple has signs {+ , − , −}. The ordering of (x,y,z) depends on the fixed convention but is a permutation of (+,−,−). ∎

Proposition 11 (Conditional |A|=4 amalgamation via a uniform 2+2 ansatz).
Fix a consistent ordering convention for the last three coordinates in the definition of F(α,β) (e.g., by increasing order of the three vertices in A\{k}). Suppose that for each (α,β)∈{++, +−, −+, −−}, all three permutations of (+,−,−) belong to F(α,β). Then for every one-point diagram over |A|=4 there exists an amalgam D∈H obtained by setting x_{ij}=w_i w_j for some choice of w with exactly two + and two − on A.

Proof. Choose any w with exactly two + and two − on A and set x_{ij}=w_i w_j. By Lemma 10, for each k the ordered triple contributed by the three edges in A\{k} is a permutation of (+,−,−). By hypothesis, this ordered triple lies in F(p^B_k,p^C_k) for every k, so no Y_k is of type O5. Therefore the resulting structure on A∪{b,c} is in H and extends both B and C. ∎

Proposition 12 (Equal-constant fixed pairs are solvable by a constant assignment).
In the |A|=4 one-point amalgamation problem, if (p^B_k,p^C_k)=(δ,δ) for all k∈A with a fixed δ∈{±1}, then there exists an amalgam D∈H obtained by setting x_{ij}≡δ.

Proof. With this assignment, for each k the 5-vector p(Y_k) equals (δ,δ,δ,δ,δ), which is ±C5. Since ±C5 is not in the O5 orbit, each Y_k is non-O5 and the amalgam lies in H. ∎

Lemma 13 (A hard local exclusion in the opposite-fixed case).
For (α,β)=(+,-), the triple (−,−,−) is forbidden: (x,y,z)=(−,−,−)∉F(+,-). Symmetrically, for (α,β)=(−,+), (+++)∉F(−,+).

Proof. For (α,β)=(+,-) and (x,y,z)=(−,−,−) one has p=(+,-,−,−,−), which is the canonical O5 representative; hence it is in the O5 orbit. By Lemma 8 (global sign-reversal is in the orbit), (−,+,+,+,+) is also in O5, yielding the symmetric statement. ∎
