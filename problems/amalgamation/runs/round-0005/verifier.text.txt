{"feedback_md":"Overall, this is a high‑quality, focused report that advances the program along three fronts: (i) fixing conventions, (ii) settling |A|=3 constructively, and (iii) providing concrete, auditable test vectors and a nontrivial solvable subclass for |A|=4. I summarize the audit and next steps.\n\nCorrectness and rigor\n- Coordinate ordering: You rightly highlight that output.md has not yet fixed the last‑three coordinate order in p(Y_k). In notes.md we have the precise order (missing c, missing b, then missing i<j<ℓ for A\\{k}). This is the convention used in your constructions; it should be restated in output when we publish F‑tables. For now, I have kept it in notes and referenced it explicitly in the new statements.\n- |A|=3 case: Your explicit choices for (x,y,z) depending on (α,β) produce p(Y) equal to ±C5 or ±H5 in the fixed coordinate order. This is sufficient to conclude non‑O5 and solves the |A|=3 one‑point step without enumeration. I have promoted this to a formal proposition in output.md with a short proof.\n- P1–P3 (|A|=4, 2+2 ansatz): The edge‑triple computations from w=(+,+,−,−) are correct. Whether the four displayed 5‑vectors lie outside O5 requires the IsO5 oracle; we cannot accept these as proven yet. I recorded them as test instances in notes and flagged them for a minimal check.\n- “Local H5 witness” pattern: The shared‑edge consistency equalities you derived (α1=α2=α3=α4; β1=α3; β4=α2; β2=β3) check out under the fixed coordinate mapping x_{ij} ↔ (missing k) as described. Under these equalities, each Y_k gets p(Y_k)=(α_k,β_k,α_k,β_k,α_k), hence is ±C5 if α_k=β_k, else ±H5. I added this as a proven solvable subclass for |A|=4 in output.md.\n- LLL remark: The statement “if each complement |{±1}^3\\F(α,β)|≤1 then the LLL (d=3) guarantees a solution” is not justified with the standard symmetric LLL. With p=1/8 and d=3, the criterion e·p·(d+1)=e/2>1 fails. Unless we leverage stronger (lopsided/cluster‑expansion) bounds tailored to our structure, this heuristic should be treated as speculative. I have annotated this caveat in notes.\n- Profiling by eq/opp only: As already noted in earlier notes, one must retain the full 4‑type vector {++, −−, +−, −+}^A; collapsing to eq/opp loses information unless one proves F(+,+)=F(−,−) and F(+,-)=F(−,+) (we only have the sign‑flip relation F(−α,−β)=−F(α,β)). Please do not reduce to eq/opp in brute‑force runs.\n\nValue triage\n- Solid, archival: the |A|=3 constructive resolution; the “local H5 witness” subclass; the concrete P1–P3 vectors for immediate IsO5 vetting; and the crisp list of minimal computational tasks (IsO5; F(+,+), F(+,-)).\n- Pending verification: the success of the 2+2 ansatz on P1–P3 and the uniform conditional Proposition 11. These will be quickly settled once F‑tables (or the four vectors) are checked.\n\nNext steps (minimal, decisive computations)\n1) Implement IsO5 using Lemma 6 (already in output). Unit tests: (+,+,+,+,+) non‑O5; (+,−,−,−,−) O5; (+,−,+,−,+) non‑O5. Also report the size of the O5 orbit under the signed S5 action.\n2) Check the four concrete 5‑vectors: (+,+,−,−,+), (+,+,+,−,−), (+,−,−,−,+), (+,−,+,−,−). If all are non‑O5, P1–P3 have witnesses with the 2+2 ansatz.\n3) Compute F(+,+) and F(+,-) completely (8 triples each) under the fixed coordinate order; derive F(−,−), F(−,+) by triplewise negation (Cor. 9). Archive these tables.\n4) If every F(α,β) contains all three permutations of (+,−,−), conclude the uniform 2+2 solution for |A|=4 (Prop. 11). Otherwise, run the full 2^6 CSP per realized 4‑type profile and either extract a satisfying assignment or a concrete UNSAT certificate.\n\nThis round’s outputs formalize the |A|=3 step and a nontrivial |A|=4 subclass, and they consolidate the minimal checks now required to resolve the |A|=4 bottleneck.","new_notes_md":"Updates: explicit |A|=3 solution, concrete |A|=4 tests, and a solvable subclass\n\nCoordinate convention reminder (used below)\n- For Y_k={b,c}∪(A\\{k}) with A={1,2,3,4} and i<j<ℓ the increasing order on A\\{k}, we encode\n  p(Y_k) = (p_{missing c}, p_{missing b}, p_{missing i}, p_{missing j}, p_{missing ℓ}).\n- Mapping of the last three coordinates to edge variables on K4[A]:\n  • p_{missing i} = x_{jℓ},  p_{missing j} = x_{iℓ},  p_{missing ℓ} = x_{ij}.\n\n|A|=3 one‑point amalgamation solved (constructive)\n- Let A have size 3.

On Y:=A∪{b,c}, write p(Y)=(α,β,x,y,z) in the coordinate order (missing c, missing b, then missing the elements of A in increasing order). Then for each (α,β)∈{±1}^2 there is a choice of (x,y,z)∈{±1}^3 such that p(Y) is not in the O5 orbit, namely:\n- If (α,β)=(+,+), take (x,y,z)=(+,+,+), so p(Y)=(+,+,+,+,+)=C5.\n- If (α,β)=(−,−), take (x,y,z)=(−,−,−), so p(Y)=(−,−,−,−,−)=−C5.\n- If (α,β)=(+,-), take (x,y,z)=(+,-,+), so p(Y)=(+,-,+,-,+)=H5.\n- If (α,β)=(−,+), take (x,y,z)=(−,+,−), so p(Y)=(−,+,−,+,−)=−H5.\nIn all cases Y is non‑O5, hence there exists an amalgam D∈H on A∪{b,c} extending B and C.\n\nProof. The only new 5‑set is Y=A∪{b,c}. The displayed assignments set its 5‑vector equal to one of ±C5 or ±H5 in the fixed coordinate order, and these are not in the O5 orbit. There are no other new 5‑sets to check. Hence the extension lies in H. ∎\n\nProposition 15 (A solvable subclass for |A|=4 via a local H5 pattern with consistency).\nLet A={1,2,3,4}, and let B=A∪{b} and C=A∪{c} lie in H and agree on A. For k∈A, write (α_k,β_k):=(p^B_k,p^C_k). Adopt the coordinate order\np(Y_k)=(p_{missing c},p_{missing b},p_{missing i},p_{missing j},p_{missing ℓ}) for Y_k={b,c}∪(A\\{k}) with i<j<ℓ the increasing order on A\\{k}. Suppose the type‑data satisfy the equalities\nα_1=α_2=α_3=α_4,\nβ_1=α_3,\nβ_4=α_2,\nβ_2=β_3.\nThen there exists an assignment to the six cross 4‑sets x_{ij}=f({i,j,b,c}) such that, for each k, p(Y_k) is ±C5 if α_k=β_k and ±H5 otherwise. In particular, an amalgam D∈H exists.\n\nProof. Define the triple of edge variables on Y_k by (x_{jℓ},x_{iℓ},x_{ij})=(α_k,β_k,α_k), where {i,j,ℓ}=A\\{k} with i<j<ℓ. Each edge variable x_{ij} appears in exactly two such triples, corresponding to the two values of k∈A\\{i,j}. The displayed equalities on the α_k and β_k are exactly those required to make these two prescriptions agree for every edge (a direct check using the mapping p_{missing i}=x_{jℓ}, p_{missing j}=x_{iℓ}, p_{missing ℓ}=x_{ij}). With this consistent assignment, p(Y_k)=(α_k,β_k,α_k,β_k,α_k), which is ±C5 if α_k=β_k and ±H5 otherwise. None of these are in the O5 orbit, so all four Y_k are non‑O5 and the resulting structure is an amalgam in H. ∎","new_outputs_append":"True","verdict":"success"}
