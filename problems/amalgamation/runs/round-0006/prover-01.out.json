  "progress_md": "Round 0006 \u2014 Focus: closing the |A|=4 one\u2011point step; small unconditional progress and a tiny decision check\n\nContext recap and what is already rigorous in output.md\n- Orientation function model (Prop. 1), sufficiency of one\u2011point amalgamation (Lemma 2), and the |A|=4 6\u2011variable CSP formulation (Prop. 3) are correct and sufficient to reduce AP to a finite local decision.\n- Small cases: |A|\u22642 are trivial (Cor. 4). The |A|=3 one\u2011point amalgamation is now fully solved constructively (Prop. 14).\n- Tools: explicit S5 signed action (Lemma 6) and central symmetry of O5 (Lemma 8, Cor. 9).\n- |A|=4: We have a conditional uniform solution (Prop. 11) via a 2+2 vertex\u2011sign ansatz x_{ij}=w_iw_j if all three permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212) are allowed in each local table F(\u03b1,\u03b2). We also have a nontrivial solvable subclass (Prop. 15) and the equal\u2011constant case (Prop. 12).\n\nNew, unconditional micro\u2011lemma (auditable) \u2014 a union\u2011bound satisfiability criterion\nLemma UB (union\u2011bound CSP feasibility for |A|=4).\n- Setup: In the |A|=4 CSP (variables x_{ij} on edges of K_4), suppose that for each triangle T_k (k=1,2,3,4), at most one ordered triple in {\u00b11}^3 is forbidden (i.e., |{\u00b11}^3\\F(\u03b1_k,\u03b2_k)| \u2264 1).\n- Claim: Then there exists a satisfying assignment to the six variables.\n- Proof: There are 2^6=64 global assignments. Fix a triangle T; forbidding one ordered triple on its three variables eliminates exactly 2^3=8 of the 64 assignments (the other three variables are free). By the union bound, the four triangles together eliminate at most 4\u00b78=32 assignments, leaving at least 32 \u2265 1 satisfying assignments.\u220e\nWhy useful here. This gives a rigorous, computation\u2011light sufficient condition for one\u2011point amalgamation at |A|=4. It reduces the task to bounding, per case (\u03b1,\u03b2), the number of forbidden triples. If a tiny computation confirms |{\u00b11}^3\\F(+,+)| \u2264 1 and |{\u00b11}^3\\F(+,-)| \u2264 1 (the other two follow by Cor. 9), then AP follows at once (by Lemma 2) without searching the 6\u2011variable space.\n\nProduct\u2011pattern conjecture (testable; would settle |A|=4 uniformly)\nConjecture P+. For both (\u03b1,\u03b2)=(+,+) and (\u03b1,\u03b2)=(+,-), one has\nF(\u03b1,\u03b2) = { (x,y,z) \u2208 {\u00b11}^3 : x\u00b7y\u00b7z = +1 }.\n- Evidence: All explicit non\u2011O5 witnesses used so far (|A|=3 and the P1\u2013P3 test vectors in notes.md) exhibit triple product +1; the only hard exclusion we proved (Lemma 13: (\u2212,\u2212,\u2212) \u2209 F(+,-)) has triple product \u22121.\n- Consequence if true: The structured ansatz x_{ij}=w_iw_j (with arbitrary w: A\u2192{\u00b11}) yields, on each triangle, product +1 (since (w_iw_j)(w_iw_k)(w_jw_k)=+1). Hence it would satisfy every local constraint for any (\u03b1_k,\u03b2_k), giving a uniform one\u2011point amalgam for |A|=4 (indeed for all |A|, by the same local reasoning). This would prove AP outright.\n- Action: This is an 8+8 evaluation check once IsO5 is in place.\n\nClarification of the triangle coordinate mapping (implementation aid)\n- For Y_k={b,c}\u222a(A\\{k}) with A={1,2,3,4} and i<j<\u2113 the increasing order on A\\{k}, our fixed encoding is\n  p(Y_k) = (p_{missing\\ c}, p_{missing\\ b}, p_{missing\\ i}, p_{missing\\ j}, p_{missing\\ \u2113}).\n- The last three coordinates are expressed via the edge\u2011variables as\n  p_{missing\\ i} = x_{j\u2113},\\quad p_{missing\\ j} = x_{i\u2113},\\quad p_{missing\\ \u2113} = x_{ij}.\nThis convention is already used in Prop. 15 and should be observed when populating F(\u03b1,\u03b2).\n\nConcrete examples and unit checks to run (tiny, decisive)\n- Maintain the unit tests for IsO5: (+,+,+,+,+) \u2209 O5; (+,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212) \u2208 O5; (+,\u2212,+,\u2212,+) \u2209 O5.\n- The four decisive test vectors from notes.md \u00a7P1\u2013P3:\n  \u2022 (+,+,\u2212,\u2212,+), (+,+,+,\u2212,\u2212), (+,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,+), (+,\u2212,+,\u2212,\u2212). Each should be classified non\u2011O5 for the 2+2 ansatz to witness those profiles.\n- Populate F(+,+) and F(+,-) fully (8 triples each). Immediate checks: (+++)\u2208F(+,+); (\u2212,\u2212,\u2212)\u2209F(+,-). Report sizes |F(+,+)|, |F(+,-)| and list the complements {\u00b11}^3\\F.\n- If both complements have size \u22641, conclude |A|=4 by Lemma UB. If, stronger, F(\u03b1,\u03b2) equals \u201cproduct +1,\u201d conclude AP by the structured ansatz (Conjecture P+).\n\nWhy these steps are valuable incremental progress\n- Lemma UB is unconditional and reduces the |A|=4 decision to checking two tiny local tables (16 values total) and two cardinality inequalities; this is significantly weaker than the earlier need to solve all 6\u2011variable instances, yet it suffices to conclude AP if the tables are as sparse as anticipated.\n- Conjecture P+ crystallizes the suspected structure of the local constraints and provides a one\u2011line uniform solution template if verified; even if false, the explicit counter\u2011entries will directly inform a minimal backtracking strategy.\n\nObstacles and open points\n- We still lack an analytic classification of the O5 orbit to certify F(\u03b1,\u03b2) without computation. Given the minute size (32 total 5\u2011vectors), a brute\u2011force enumeration remains the quickest rigorous path.\n- The conditional Prop. 11 remains unverified pending the membership of the three permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212) in each F(\u03b1,\u03b2). This should be settled by the same F\u2011table computation.\n\nGaps, corrections, and notes on output.md\n- Prop. 3 uses a coordinate\u2011free description of Y_k; when F\u2011tables are integrated into output.md, it would be helpful to restate the fixed 5\u2011coordinate ordering (as above) near Prop. 3 or before Prop. 11 (currently the precise ordering is spelled out later in Prop. 15).\n- All other statements in output.md remain correct; no further errors spotted. Lemma 13 is properly justified (it uses the canonical O5 representative under the fixed coordinate order).\n\nNext steps for the verifier (minimal and decisive)\n1) Implement IsO5 via Lemma 6; run the three unit tests and report the O5 orbit size.\n2) Evaluate IsO5 on the four concrete 5\u2011vectors listed above to settle P1\u2013P3 for the 2+2 ansatz.\n3) Compute F(+,+) and F(+,-) completely; derive the other two by Cor. 9. Report complements and sizes.\n4) If |{\u00b11}^3\\F(+,+)| \u2264 1 and |{\u00b11}^3\\F(+,-)| \u2264 1, invoke Lemma UB to conclude the |A|=4 step and AP.\n5) If, stronger, F(\u03b1,\u03b2)={triples with product +1} in both cases, record the uniform construction x_{ij}=w_iw_j as a final proof strategy for all |A|.\n6) If either complement has size \u22652, run the 2^6 brute\u2011force CSP per realized (B,C) profiles or at least per the 16 type\u2011patterns over k\u2208A (keeping the ordered pairs {++,\u2212\u2212,+\u2212,\u2212+}); archive either SAT witnesses or a single UNSAT certificate (refuting AP).\n\nEnd of round summary\n- Introduced a new unconditional lemma (union\u2011bound feasibility) that can, by checking two 8\u2011entry tables, settle |A|=4 and hence AP.\n- Formulated the \u201cproduct +1\u201d conjecture (precisely testable) which, if true, yields a uniform, simple construction for the amalgam.\n- Provided precise, small computational tasks that will decisively resolve the remaining |A|=4 bottleneck, along with explicit test vectors and sanity checks."
