Fix a triangle T; forbidding one ordered triple on its three variables eliminates exactly 2^3=8 of the 64 assignments (the other three variables are free). By the union bound, the four triangles together eliminate at most 4·8=32 assignments, leaving at least 32 ≥ 1 satisfying assignments.∎\\nWhy useful here. This gives a rigorous, computation‑light sufficient condition for one‑point amalgamation at |A|=4. It reduces the task to bounding, per case (α,β), the number of forbidden triples. If a tiny computation confirms |{±1}^3\\\\F(+,+)| ≤ 1 and |{±1}^3\\\\F(+,-)| ≤ 1 (the other two follow by Cor. 9), then AP follows at once (by Lemma 2) without searching the 6‑variable space.\\n\\nProduct‑pattern conjecture (testable; would settle |A|=4 uniformly)\\nConjecture P+. For both (α,β)=(+,+) and (α,β)=(+,-), one has\\nF(α,β) = { (x,y,z) ∈ {±1}^3 : x·y·z = +1 }.\\n- Evidence: All explicit non‑O5 witnesses used so far (|A|=3 and the P1–P3 test vectors in notes.md) exhibit triple product +1; the only hard exclusion we proved (Lemma 13: (−,−,−) ∉ F(+,-)) has triple product −1.\\n- Consequence if true: The structured ansatz x_{ij}=w_iw_j (with arbitrary w: A→{±1}) yields, on each triangle, product +1 (since (w_iw_j)(w_iw_k)(w_jw_k)=+1). Hence it would satisfy every local constraint for any (α_k,β_k), giving a uniform one‑point amalgam for |A|=4 (indeed for all |A|, by the same local reasoning). This would prove AP outright.\\n- Action: This is an 8+8 evaluation check once IsO5 is in place.\\n\\nClarification of the triangle coordinate mapping (implementation aid)\\n- For Y_k={b,c}∪(A\\\\{k}) with A={1,2,3,4} and i<j<ℓ the increasing order on A\\\\{k}, our fixed encoding is\\n  p(Y_k) = (p_{missing\\\\ c}, p_{missing\\\\ b}, p_{missing\\\\ i}, p_{missing\\\\ j}, p_{missing\\\\ ℓ}).\\n- The last three coordinates are expressed via the edge‑variables as\\n  p_{missing\\\\ i} = x_{jℓ},\\\\quad p_{missing\\\\ j} = x_{iℓ},\\\\quad p_{missing\\\\ ℓ} = x_{ij}.\\nThis convention is already used in Prop. 15 and should be observed when populating F(α,β).\\n\\nConcrete examples and unit checks to run (tiny, decisive)\\n- Maintain the unit tests for IsO5: (+,+,+,+,+) ∉ O5; (+,−,−,−,−) ∈ O5; (+,−,+,−,+) ∉ O5.\\n- The four decisive test vectors from notes.md §P1–P3:\\n  • (+,+,−,−,+), (+,+,+,−,−), (+,−,−,−,+), (+,−,+,−,−). Each should be classified non‑O5 for the 2+2 ansatz to witness those profiles.\\n- Populate F(+,+) and F(+,-) fully (8 triples each). Immediate checks: (+++)∈F(+,+); (−,−,−)∉F(+,-). Report sizes |F(+,+)|, |F(+,-)| and list the complements {±1}^3\\\\F.\\n- If both complements have size ≤1, conclude |A|=4 by Lemma UB. If, stronger, F(α,β) equals “product +1,” conclude AP by the structured ansatz (Conjecture P+).\\n\\nWhy these steps are valuable incremental progress\\n- Lemma UB is unconditional and reduces the |A|=4 decision to checking two tiny local tables (16 values total) and two cardinality inequalities; this is significantly weaker than the earlier need to solve all 6‑variable instances, yet it suffices to conclude AP if the tables are as sparse as anticipated.\\n- Conjecture P+ crystallizes the suspected structure of the local constraints and provides a one‑line uniform solution template if verified; even if false, the explicit counter‑entries will directly inform a minimal backtracking strategy.\\n\\nObstacles and open points\\n- We still lack an analytic classification of the O5 orbit to certify F(α,β) without computation. Given the minute size (32 total 5‑vectors), a brute‑force enumeration remains the quickest rigorous path.\\n- The conditional Prop. 11 remains unverified pending the membership of the three permutations of (+,−,−) in each F(α,β). This should be settled by the same F‑table computation.\\n\\nGaps, corrections, and notes on output.md\\n- Prop. 3 uses a coordinate‑free description of Y_k; when F‑tables are integrated into output.md, it would be helpful to restate the fixed 5‑coordinate ordering (as above) near Prop. 3 or before Prop. 11 (currently the precise ordering is spelled out later in Prop. 15).\\n- All other statements in output.md remain correct; no further errors spotted. Lemma 13 is properly justified (it uses the canonical O5 representative under the fixed coordinate order).\\n\\nNext steps for the verifier (minimal and decisive)\\n1) Implement IsO5 via Lemma 6; run the three unit tests and report the O5 orbit size.\\n2) Evaluate IsO5 on the four concrete 5‑vectors listed above to settle P1–P3 for the 2+2 ansatz.\\n3) Compute F(+,+) and F(+,-) completely; derive the other two by Cor. 9. Report complements and sizes.\\n4) If |{±1}^3\\\\F(+,+)| ≤ 1 and |{±1}^3\\\\F(+,-)| ≤ 1, invoke Lemma UB to conclude the |A|=4 step and AP.\\n5) If, stronger, F(α,β)={triples with product +1} in both cases, record the uniform construction x_{ij}=w_iw_j as a final proof strategy for all |A|.\\n6) If either complement has size ≥2, run the 2^6 brute‑force CSP per realized (B,C) profiles or at least per the 16 type‑patterns over k∈A (keeping the ordered pairs {++,−−,+−,−+}); archive either SAT witnesses or a single UNSAT certificate (refuting AP).\\n\\nEnd of round summary\\n- Introduced a new unconditional lemma (union‑bound feasibility) that can, by checking two 8‑entry tables, settle |A|=4 and hence AP.\\n- Formulated the “product +1” conjecture (precisely testable) which, if true, yields a uniform, simple construction for the amalgam.\\n- Provided precise, small computational tasks that will decisively resolve the remaining |A|=4 bottleneck, along with explicit test vectors and sanity checks.\"}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"auto","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"ProverOutput","schema_":{"properties":{"progress_md":{"description":"Append-only progress notes","title":"Progress Md","type":"string"}},"required":["progress_md"],"title":"ProverOutput","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":38422,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":13764,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":11712},"total_tokens":52186},"user":null,"store":true}
