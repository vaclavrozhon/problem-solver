  "progress_md": "Status and aim\n- We continue to resolve the one-point amalgamation for |A|=4, which reduces AP for H to a finite CSP on six edge variables with four local 5-set constraints (output.md Prop. 3). The computational oracle IsO5 is still the bottleneck; I add rigorously checkable lemmas that simplify the local constraint analysis and shrink the number of patterns to verify.\n\nNew lemma: explicit O5-image formula (useful for hand checks)\n- Lemma (O5 image equals \u201c\u2212\u03b5 off one coordinate\u201d). Let e_O = (+,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212). For any \u03c4\u2208S_5 with \u03b5(\u03c4)=(\u03b5_1,\u2026,\u03b5_5) and any i_0 with \u03c4^{-1}(i_0)=the + position of e_O, the image p\u2032 under the signed action satisfies\n  p\u2032_i = \u2212\u03b5_i for i\u2260i_0, and p\u2032_{i_0} = \u03b5_{i_0}.\n  Proof. Immediate from p\u2032_i = \u03b5_i\u00b7(e_O)_{\u03c4^{-1}(i)} and that (e_O)_j is + at one j and \u2212 otherwise.\n- Why useful: To test whether a target 5-vector p lies in the O5 orbit, it suffices to check if there exists some i_0 with \u03b5 determined by \u03b5_{i_0}=p_{i_0} and \u03b5_i=\u2212p_i for i\u2260i_0 such that \u03b5=\u03b5(\u03c4) for some \u03c4. This is a sharper necessary-and-sufficient condition and provides quick hand-proofs in some cases.\n\nCorollary: all-equal triple is forbidden in the opposite-fixed case (now with a clean proof)\n- Corollary (completes the \u201chard exclusion\u201d in both directions). For (\u03b1,\u03b2)=(+,-), both (+++) and (---) are forbidden: (x,y,z)\u2209F(+,-) for (x,y,z)=(+,+,+) and (x,y,z)=(\u2212,\u2212,\u2212). Proof:\n  \u2022 (---) gives p=(+,-,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212), the canonical O5 representative.\n  \u2022 (+++) gives p=(+,-,+,+,+). By Lemma 8 there exists \u03c4 with \u03b5_i(\u03c4)=\u22121 for all i. Taking i_0=2 yields p\u2032 with p\u2032_2=\u03b5_2=\u22121 and p\u2032_i=\u2212\u03b5_i=+1 for i\u22602, i.e., p\u2032=(+,-,+,+,+). Hence p is in O5.\u220e\n- Symmetrically, for (\u03b1,\u03b2)=(\u2212,+), both (+++) and (---) are forbidden by global sign reversal (output.md Cor. 9).\n- Why useful: This fully classifies the all-equal triples for the opposite-fixed case without computation, tightening the F(+,-) and F(\u2212,+) tables and providing robust unit tests for IsO5.\n\nHand-verified \u03b5-examples (sanity catalog for the verifier)\n- Using Lemma 6, I computed \u03b5(\u03c4) for small \u03c4 (useful to debug IsO5):\n  \u2022 id: \u03b5=(+,+,+,+,+), \u03a3\u03b5=+5.\n  \u2022 (12): \u03b5=(+,+,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212), \u03a3\u03b5=\u22121.\n  \u2022 (123): \u03b5=(+,\u2212,\u2212,+,+), \u03a3\u03b5=+1.\n  \u2022 (12)(34): \u03b5=(\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,+), \u03a3\u03b5=\u22123.\n  \u2022 (13): \u03b5=(\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212), \u03a3\u03b5=\u22125 (the \u201ccentral\u201d flip from Lemma 8).\n  These confirm that \u03a3\u03b5 can realize \u00b15, \u00b13, \u00b11, so constraints based solely on \u03a3\u03b5 (or plus-counts) cannot rule out O5 membership.\n\nExample checks guided by the O5-image formula\n- For p=(+,-,+,-,-): considering i_0=2 gives \u03b5=(\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,+,+); i_0=1 gives \u03b5=(+,+,\u2212,+,+). Both patterns appear plausible from small \u03c4, but I do not assert membership either way; this illustrates how the formula reduces a membership query to \u201cdoes this \u03b5 occur as \u03b5(\u03c4)?\u201d, which is trivial to decide computationally and infeasible by hand enumeration.\n\nNew solvable family via 2+2 vertex-sign ansatz (synthesis and scope)\n- Recall Lemma 10 and Prop. 11. Under x_{ij}=w_iw_j with exactly two + and two \u2212 on A, each triangle-triple is a permutation of (+,\u2212,\u2212). Thus, if the verifier confirms that every F(\u03b1,\u03b2) contains all three permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212), then the one-point step over |A|=4 is uniformly solvable (Prop. 11), implying AP for H (Lemma 2).\n- I emphasize that the only remaining local memberships to check for this route are the 12 entries: for each (\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2208{++, +\u2212, \u2212+, \u2212\u2212}, the three permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212). Cor. 9 halves this (the two opposite-sign cases follow by triplewise negation), so only F(+,+) and F(+,-) need computing.\n\nRefined classification of 4-bit type patterns on A (search-space reduction)\n- Observation (C5): For any B of type C5 on A\u222a{b}, the 5-vector on that 5-set is constant \u00b1, hence the 4-bit pattern (p^B_k)_{k\u2208A} is constant (all equal) as well. This confirms that, in the one-point data, any non-constant 4-bit pattern on A must come from an H5 side.\n- Heuristic (H5, to be verified computationally): For any C of type H5 on A\u222a{c}, the 4-bit pattern (p^C_k)_{k\u2208A} consists of exactly two + and two \u2212 (never all equal). The canonical representative (+,\u2212,+,\u2212) exhibits this; testing whether all six 2\u20132 patterns occur will reduce the |A|=4 enumeration by symmetry. Action item: Enumerate the orbit of H5 under relabelings that fix c and record the distinct 4-bit patterns on A; this bounds the profile list to check.\n\nObstacles and why a small computation remains necessary\n- Attempts to certify (+,\u2212,\u2212)-admissibility analytically in F(+,+) or F(+,-) via parity/sum invariants fail because the S_5 signed action realizes \u03b5 with all odd sums, and the O5 orbit is large. The O5-image formula reduces membership to \u03b5-realizability, yet characterizing the full image E={\u03b5(\u03c4):\u03c4\u2208S_5} pen-and-paper appears cumbersome. A 120-step enumeration is the right tool here.\n\nActionable next steps for the verifier (precise and minimal)\n1) Implement IsO5 via output.md Lemma 6. Unit tests: (+,+,+,+,+) non\u2011O5; (+,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212) O5; (+,\u2212,+,\u2212,+) non\u2011O5; and the five \u03b5-vectors above should appear for the listed \u03c4.\n2) Populate F(+,+) and F(+,-) (8 triples each) under the fixed coordinate order (notes/output). Obtain F(\u2212,\u2212), F(\u2212,+) by triplewise negation (Cor. 9). Confirm the proven exclusions: for (+,-), exclude (+++) and (---).\n3) Check the 12 key memberships: for each (\u03b1,\u03b2), all permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212) belong to F(\u03b1,\u03b2). If yes, conclude the |A|=4 one\u2011point step via Prop. 11 and hence AP (Lemma 2).\n4) If any of those memberships fail, revert to the 2^6 brute\u2011force CSP per realized (B,C) profile (with the H5 4-bit patterns catalogued as above). Either archive SAT assignments or produce an UNSAT certificate.\n\nGaps and clarifications in output.md\n- Prop. 11 remains conditional on the F-table check; it should eventually cite explicitly which 12 memberships were verified. The present round supplies a complete proof that (+++) and (---) are both forbidden in F(+,-), filling a previously flagged gap.\n- The precise ordering of the last three coordinates in p(Y_k) is critical and already stated; when the F-tables are recorded, repeat this convention in output.md adjacent to their definition for reproducibility.\n\nSummary of this round\u2019s contributions\n- Introduced and proved the O5-image formula p = \u2212\u03b5 off one coordinate, enabling quick hand checks and guiding IsO5 implementation.\n- Fully classified \u201call-equal\u201d triples in the opposite-fixed case as O5 (forbidden) by a short, rigorous argument.\n- Provided computed \u03b5-vectors for several small \u03c4 as sanity data.\n- Outlined a minimal verification plan: compute two F-tables, test 12 memberships to unlock the uniform 2+2 solution; otherwise, fall back to the tiny 2^6 CSP with a reduced profile list via H5\u2019s 4-bit patterns on A."
