  "progress_md": "Status and focus\n- We keep the one\u2011point reduction and the 6\u2011variable CSP for |A|=4 (output.md Prop. 3). The key missing piece remains deciding the local 5\u2011set constraints, i.e., membership in F(\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2286{\u00b11}^3 (output.md Cor. 9 gives the sign\u2011flip symmetry, but we still need explicit tables or at least a few decisive entries).\n- Proposition 11 is conditional; Proposition 12 settles the equal\u2011constant subcase; Proposition 14 settles |A|=3; Proposition 15 provides a further solvable subclass. No contradictions detected in output.md.\n\nNew micro\u2011lemmas and structural observations (auditable)\n1) Type patterns on A induced by 5\u2011types (enumeration aid).\n- Lemma T. Let B be a 5\u2011vertex structure on A\u222a{b} with type T_B\u2208{C5,H5}. Then the 4\u2011tuple (p^B_k)_{k\u2208A} equals:\n  \u2022 Constant (all + or all \u2212) if T_B=C5.\n  \u2022 A 2+2 pattern (exactly two + and two \u2212) if T_B=H5.\n  Proof. For the 5\u2011vector p on A\u222a{b}, p_x is constant on C5; restricting to coordinates indexed by A yields a constant 4\u2011tuple. For H5, the canonical representative (+,\u2212,+,\u2212,+), after removing the \u201cmissing b\u201d coordinate, leaves exactly two + and two \u2212 on A; S4 relabelings of A preserve the 2+2 property.\u220e\n- Why useful: Narrows the |A|=4 case analysis to macro\u2011profiles (C,C), (C,H), (H,C), (H,H), and within each, the eq/opp pattern over k is now strongly constrained (e.g., C vs H yields exactly two equals and two opposites).\n\n2) Triangle triple distribution under vertex\u2011sign assignments (combinatorial control).\n- Lemma D. Let w\u2208{\u00b11}^A and set x_{ij}=w_i w_j. For the four triangles (Y_k), the triple on Y_k is:\n  \u2022 If |{i:w_i=+1}|=4 or 0: all four triples are (+++).\n  \u2022 If |{i:w_i=+1}|=3 or 1: exactly one Y_k has (+++); the other three have permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212).\n  \u2022 If |{i:w_i=+1}|=2: all four Y_k have permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212).\n  Proof. For a 3\u2011vertex set, the pairwise products are (+++) if all three w are equal; otherwise exactly one edge\u2011product is + and two are \u2212. Counting how many triangles contain three equal signs yields the cases above.\u220e\n- Why useful: This extends Lemma 10 (the 2+2 case) and gives us three controllable regimes (0/1/4 occurrences of (+++)) by choosing w with 2+/2\u2212, 3+/1\u2212 (or 1+/3\u2212), or 4+/0\u2212 (or 0+/4\u2212).\n\n3) Global parity constraint across the four triangles (sanity check for UNSAT certificates).\n- Lemma P (parity). For any assignment x_{ij}\u2208{\u00b11}, the product of the four triangle\u2011products equals +1. Equivalently, the number of triangles whose triple has product \u22121 is even.\n  Proof. Each edge variable x_{ij} appears in exactly two triangles of K_4, hence \u220f_k (x_{ab}x_{ac}x_{bc} on triangle k) = \u220f_{edges} x_{ij}^2 = 1.\u220e\n- Why useful: If future F\u2011tables force odd parity (e.g., three triangles requiring triple product \u22121 and one requiring +1), we get an immediate contradiction, giving a clean UNSAT witness.\n\n4) Minimal decisive membership checks for the 2+2/3+1 strategy (refinement of Prop. 11).\n- Observation: The vertex\u2011sign method only ever produces (+++) or permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212). Thus, to certify existence of an amalgam, it suffices to know, per (\u03b1,\u03b2): whether (+++) is allowed and whether the specific permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212) that occur under a chosen w are allowed.\n- Conditional Proposition 11\u2032 (weaker prerequisites than Prop. 11). Fix the coordinate order from notes/output. If the following hold:\n  (E1) (+++)\u2208F(+,+) and (+++)\u2208F(\u2212,\u2212) (true: \u00b1C5),\n  (E2) For (\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2208{(+,+),(\u2212,\u2212)}, at least one of the two concrete permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212) realized by a 2+2 choice w=(+,+,\u2212,\u2212) (e.g., (+,\u2212,\u2212) and (\u2212,\u2212,+) as in P1) lies in F(\u03b1,\u03b2),\n  (E3) For (\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2208{(+,-),(\u2212,+)}, at least one of the two concrete permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212) realized by a 2+2 choice w lies in F(\u03b1,\u03b2),\n  (E4) For (\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2208{(+,-)}, (+++)\u2208F(+,-) or else (E3) holds and the count of k with (\u03b1_k,\u03b2_k)=(+,-) is even (so w with 2+2 can serve). For (\u2212,+), (+++) is known forbidden (output.md Lemma 13), so require (E3) for those k.\n  then every one\u2011point instance over |A|=4 is solvable by choosing w with 2+2, 3+1, or 4+0 as appropriate (use Lemma D to match how many (+++) triples are needed).\n- Why useful: This further reduces the needed F\u2011table data to a handful of entries tied to the two triple shapes the vertex\u2011sign method can realize, and it incorporates the parity Lemma P to handle counts.\n\nConcrete test vectors (to be evaluated by IsO5)\n- As already prepared in notes/output, validating the following suffices to green\u2011light the 2+2 ansatz on central profiles:\n  \u2022 P1 (C vs C, aligned): (+,+,\u2212,\u2212,+), (+,+,+,\u2212,\u2212).\n  \u2022 P2 (C vs C, opposed): (+,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,+), (+,\u2212,+,\u2212,\u2212).\n  \u2022 P3 (C vs H, mixed): same two vectors as P2.\n- Action: A single IsO5 pass on these four 5\u2011vectors decides P1\u2013P3. If all are non\u2011O5, we have explicit amalgams for these macro\u2011profiles.\n\nEnumeration of macro\u2011profiles and expected eq/opp distribution (for small exhaustive runs)\n- By Lemma T, the four p^B_k (k\u2208A) are: all equal (C) or 2+2 (H). Hence, up to S4 on A, the possibilities are:\n  \u2022 (C,C): either all eq (\u03b4,\u03b4) or all opp (\u03b4,\u2212\u03b4).\n  \u2022 (C,H) or (H,C): exactly two eq and two opp (which of the two depends on \u03b4 and the 2+2 positions).\n  \u2022 (H,H): 4 eq (when identical), 0 eq (when negations), or 2 eq.\n- These five eq/opp profiles, coupled with which positions within the 2+2 pattern, represent all realizable one\u2011point patterns.\n- Why useful: This confines the 2^6 brute\u2011force search to a tiny, structured set of cases for final certification if needed.\n\nGaps/clarifications in output.md\n- Prop. 11 requires \u201call three permutations\u201d of (+,\u2212,\u2212) in each F(\u03b1,\u03b2). For our vertex\u2011sign method, only two concrete permutations occur for a fixed 2+2 choice; moreover, we can swap which two appear by permuting which vertices receive w=+ (Lemma D/notes\u2019 P1\u2013P3). It would be slightly sharper to state a conditional that only requires those two realized permutations (as in Proposition 11\u2032 above) rather than all three.\n- The precise mapping from the triple (x_{j\u2113},x_{i\u2113},x_{ij}) to the last three coordinates of p(Y_k) is stated in notes.md but not explicitly in output.md\u2019s Prop. 3. When F\u2011tables are finalized, restating the \u201cmissing i/j/\u2113\u201d order there would aid reproducibility.\n\nObstacles\n- An analytic characterization of F(+,+) and F(+,-) remains elusive. We therefore continue to rely on the minimal computation plan (IsO5 oracle + 16 evaluations) to settle them.\n- We cannot presently certify or refute the status of (+++) in F(+,-) without computation (we correctly retracted a heuristic argument earlier; output.md Lemma 13 addresses only (---)\u2209F(+,-)).\n\nNext steps for the verifier (small, decisive)\n1) Run IsO5 on the four vectors listed under P1\u2013P3.\n2) Compute F(+,+), F(+,-) fully (8 triples each) under the fixed coordinate convention; derive F(\u2212,\u2212), F(\u2212,+) by sign\u2011flip (Cor. 9). Archive tables.\n3) If both (+,\u2212,\u2212) and (\u2212,\u2212,+) lie in each F(\u03b1,\u03b2), apply output.md Prop. 11 directly. Otherwise, apply Proposition 11\u2032 + Lemma D + parity Lemma P to choose between 2+2 vs 3+1 vs 4+0 for each macro\u2011profile, using (+++) where allowed to match the required counts among k.\n4) If any macro\u2011profile remains unresolved, brute\u2011force its 2^6 assignments (Prop. 3), report SAT/UNSAT, and archive witnesses/certificates.\n\nWhy this is progress\n- We refined the uniform vertex\u2011sign construction beyond the 2+2 case (Lemma D), and distilled the necessary F\u2011table checks to a minimal, actionable set (Proposition 11\u2032), incorporating a global parity invariant (Lemma P).\n- We classified the realizable p^B, p^C patterns over A (Lemma T), narrowing the remaining search to five macro\u2011profiles and providing a clear plan to dispatch each.\n- These steps are immediately testable by the IsO5 routine and require only a handful of evaluations to either conclude AP or extract a concrete counterexample."
