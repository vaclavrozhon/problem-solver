The key missing piece remains deciding the local 5‑set constraints, i.e., membership in F(α,β)⊆{±1}^3 (output.md Cor. 9 gives the sign‑flip symmetry, but we still need explicit tables or at least a few decisive entries).\\n- Proposition 11 is conditional; Proposition 12 settles the equal‑constant subcase; Proposition 14 settles |A|=3; Proposition 15 provides a further solvable subclass. No contradictions detected in output.md.\\n\\nNew micro‑lemmas and structural observations (auditable)\\n1) Type patterns on A induced by 5‑types (enumeration aid).\\n- Lemma T. Let B be a 5‑vertex structure on A∪{b} with type T_B∈{C5,H5}. Then the 4‑tuple (p^B_k)_{k∈A} equals:\\n  • Constant (all + or all −) if T_B=C5.\\n  • A 2+2 pattern (exactly two + and two −) if T_B=H5.\\n  Proof. For the 5‑vector p on A∪{b}, p_x is constant on C5; restricting to coordinates indexed by A yields a constant 4‑tuple. For H5, the canonical representative (+,−,+,−,+), after removing the “missing b” coordinate, leaves exactly two + and two − on A; S4 relabelings of A preserve the 2+2 property.∎\\n- Why useful: Narrows the |A|=4 case analysis to macro‑profiles (C,C), (C,H), (H,C), (H,H), and within each, the eq/opp pattern over k is now strongly constrained (e.g., C vs H yields exactly two equals and two opposites).\\n\\n2) Triangle triple distribution under vertex‑sign assignments (combinatorial control).\\n- Lemma D. Let w∈{±1}^A and set x_{ij}=w_i w_j. For the four triangles (Y_k), the triple on Y_k is:\\n  • If |{i:w_i=+1}|=4 or 0: all four triples are (+++).\\n  • If |{i:w_i=+1}|=3 or 1: exactly one Y_k has (+++); the other three have permutations of (+,−,−).\\n  • If |{i:w_i=+1}|=2: all four Y_k have permutations of (+,−,−).\\n  Proof. For a 3‑vertex set, the pairwise products are (+++) if all three w are equal; otherwise exactly one edge‑product is + and two are −. Counting how many triangles contain three equal signs yields the cases above.∎\\n- Why useful: This extends Lemma 10 (the 2+2 case) and gives us three controllable regimes (0/1/4 occurrences of (+++)) by choosing w with 2+/2−, 3+/1− (or 1+/3−), or 4+/0− (or 0+/4−).\\n\\n3) Global parity constraint across the four triangles (sanity check for UNSAT certificates).\\n- Lemma P (parity). For any assignment x_{ij}∈{±1}, the product of the four triangle‑products equals +1. Equivalently, the number of triangles whose triple has product −1 is even.\\n  Proof. Each edge variable x_{ij} appears in exactly two triangles of K_4, hence ∏_k (x_{ab}x_{ac}x_{bc} on triangle k) = ∏_{edges} x_{ij}^2 = 1.∎\\n- Why useful: If future F‑tables force odd parity (e.g., three triangles requiring triple product −1 and one requiring +1), we get an immediate contradiction, giving a clean UNSAT witness.\\n\\n4) Minimal decisive membership checks for the 2+2/3+1 strategy (refinement of Prop. 11).\\n- Observation: The vertex‑sign method only ever produces (+++) or permutations of (+,−,−). Thus, to certify existence of an amalgam, it suffices to know, per (α,β): whether (+++) is allowed and whether the specific permutations of (+,−,−) that occur under a chosen w are allowed.\\n- Conditional Proposition 11′ (weaker prerequisites than Prop. 11). Fix the coordinate order from notes/output. If the following hold:\\n  (E1) (+++)∈F(+,+) and (+++)∈F(−,−) (true: ±C5),\\n  (E2) For (α,β)∈{(+,+),(−,−)}, at least one of the two concrete permutations of (+,−,−) realized by a 2+2 choice w=(+,+,−,−) (e.g., (+,−,−) and (−,−,+) as in P1) lies in F(α,β),\\n  (E3) For (α,β)∈{(+,-),(−,+)}, at least one of the two concrete permutations of (+,−,−) realized by a 2+2 choice w lies in F(α,β),\\n  (E4) For (α,β)∈{(+,-)}, (+++)∈F(+,-) or else (E3) holds and the count of k with (α_k,β_k)=(+,-) is even (so w with 2+2 can serve). For (−,+), (+++) is known forbidden (output.md Lemma 13), so require (E3) for those k.\\n  then every one‑point instance over |A|=4 is solvable by choosing w with 2+2, 3+1, or 4+0 as appropriate (use Lemma D to match how many (+++) triples are needed).\\n- Why useful: This further reduces the needed F‑table data to a handful of entries tied to the two triple shapes the vertex‑sign method can realize, and it incorporates the parity Lemma P to handle counts.\\n\\nConcrete test vectors (to be evaluated by IsO5)\\n- As already prepared in notes/output, validating the following suffices to green‑light the 2+2 ansatz on central profiles:\\n  • P1 (C vs C, aligned): (+,+,−,−,+), (+,+,+,−,−).\\n  • P2 (C vs C, opposed): (+,−,−,−,+), (+,−,+,−,−).\\n  • P3 (C vs H, mixed): same two vectors as P2.\\n- Action: A single IsO5 pass on these four 5‑vectors decides P1–P3. If all are non‑O5, we have explicit amalgams for these macro‑profiles.\\n\\nEnumeration of macro‑profiles and expected eq/opp distribution (for small exhaustive runs)\\n- By Lemma T, the four p^B_k (k∈A) are: all equal (C) or 2+2 (H). Hence, up to S4 on A, the possibilities are:\\n  • (C,C): either all eq (δ,δ) or all opp (δ,−δ).\\n  • (C,H) or (H,C): exactly two eq and two opp (which of the two depends on δ and the 2+2 positions).\\n  • (H,H): 4 eq (when identical), 0 eq (when negations), or 2 eq.\\n- These five eq/opp profiles, coupled with which positions within the 2+2 pattern, represent all realizable one‑point patterns.\\n- Why useful: This confines the 2^6 brute‑force search to a tiny, structured set of cases for final certification if needed.\\n\\nGaps/clarifications in output.md\\n- Prop. 11 requires “all three permutations” of (+,−,−) in each F(α,β). For our vertex‑sign method, only two concrete permutations occur for a fixed 2+2 choice; moreover, we can swap which two appear by permuting which vertices receive w=+ (Lemma D/notes’ P1–P3). It would be slightly sharper to state a conditional that only requires those two realized permutations (as in Proposition 11′ above) rather than all three.\\n- The precise mapping from the triple (x_{jℓ},x_{iℓ},x_{ij}) to the last three coordinates of p(Y_k) is stated in notes.md but not explicitly in output.md’s Prop. 3. When F‑tables are finalized, restating the “missing i/j/ℓ” order there would aid reproducibility.\\n\\nObstacles\\n- An analytic characterization of F(+,+) and F(+,-) remains elusive. We therefore continue to rely on the minimal computation plan (IsO5 oracle + 16 evaluations) to settle them.\\n- We cannot presently certify or refute the status of (+++) in F(+,-) without computation (we correctly retracted a heuristic argument earlier; output.md Lemma 13 addresses only (---)∉F(+,-)).\\n\\nNext steps for the verifier (small, decisive)\\n1) Run IsO5 on the four vectors listed under P1–P3.\\n2) Compute F(+,+), F(+,-) fully (8 triples each) under the fixed coordinate convention; derive F(−,−), F(−,+) by sign‑flip (Cor. 9). Archive tables.\\n3) If both (+,−,−) and (−,−,+) lie in each F(α,β), apply output.md Prop. 11 directly. Otherwise, apply Proposition 11′ + Lemma D + parity Lemma P to choose between 2+2 vs 3+1 vs 4+0 for each macro‑profile, using (+++) where allowed to match the required counts among k.\\n4) If any macro‑profile remains unresolved, brute‑force its 2^6 assignments (Prop. 3), report SAT/UNSAT, and archive witnesses/certificates.\\n\\nWhy this is progress\\n- We refined the uniform vertex‑sign construction beyond the 2+2 case (Lemma D), and distilled the necessary F‑table checks to a minimal, actionable set (Proposition 11′), incorporating a global parity invariant (Lemma P).\\n- We classified the realizable p^B, p^C patterns over A (Lemma T), narrowing the remaining search to five macro‑profiles and providing a clear plan to dispatch each.\\n- These steps are immediately testable by the IsO5 routine and require only a handful of evaluations to either conclude AP or extract a concrete counterexample.\"}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"auto","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"ProverOutput","schema_":{"properties":{"progress_md":{"description":"Append-only progress notes","title":"Progress Md","type":"string"}},"required":["progress_md"],"title":"ProverOutput","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":38422,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":13973,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":11584},"total_tokens":52395},"user":null,"store":true}
