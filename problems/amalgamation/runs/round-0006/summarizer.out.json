  "summary_md": "Round 0006 introduced a small, auditable unconditional lemma (UB) that reduces the |A|=4 one\u2011point CSP to two tiny 8\u2011entry local tables: if each triangle forbids \u22641 triple then the 6\u2011variable instance is satisfiable by a union\u2011bound count. A sharp O5\u2011image formula (p' = \u2212\u03b5 off one coordinate) was proved to speed IsO5 membership tests. The 2+2 vertex\u2011sign ansatz (x_{ij}=w_iw_j) was sharpened: if certain (+,\u2212,\u2212) permutations lie in the local F(\u03b1,\u03b2) tables then Prop.11 yields a uniform solution; weaker, concrete prerequisites were distilled (Prop.11\u2032). Structural lemmas (T, D, P) classify 5\u2011types as constant vs 2+2 on A, control which triangle\u2011triples appear under w choices, and give an even\u2011parity constraint on triangle products \u2014 all shrink the brute\u2011force search. A remaining, decisive computational task is to run IsO5 and populate F(+,+),F(+,\u2212); note a discrepancy in the notes about whether (+++)\u2208F(+,\u2212) (claimed excluded in one draft, later retracted), so enumeration is needed.

    "Lemma UB (union\u2011bound): if every triangle forbids at most one ordered triple, the 6\u2011edge CSP on K4 has \u22651 global solution (64\u22124\u00b78\u22651).",
    "O5\u2011image formula: any O5 image equals \u2212\u03b5 on all but one coordinate (fast necessary\u2011and\u2011sufficient test for IsO5 membership).",
    "2+2 vertex\u2011sign ansatz narrowed: only a small set (\u226412) of local F\u2011table memberships need checking to validate Prop.11 (uniform one\u2011point amalgam for |A|=4).",
    "Product\u2011pattern conjecture P+: hypothesizes F(\u03b1,\u03b2) = {triples with product +1}; if true, x_{ij}=w_iw_j solves all local constraints uniformly and would prove AP.",
    "Structural reductions: Lemma T (C5 vs H5 give constant vs 2+2 patterns), Lemma D (counts of (+++) occurrences under w choices), and Lemma P (even parity of triangle triple\u2011products) cut the search to a few macro\u2011profiles.",
    "Actionable verification plan: implement IsO5, run unit tests and 4 decisive 5\u2011vectors, then compute the two 8\u2011entry tables F(+,+),F(+,\u2212) and apply UB/Prop.11 or fall back to tiny 2^6 brute force."

    "Compute F(+,+) and F(+,\u2212) (8 triples each) under the fixed coordinate convention; report the complements and sizes. If both complements have size \u22641 invoke Lemma UB; otherwise check the 12 (+,\u2212,\u2212) membership entries for Prop.11/11\u2032.",
    "If the above fail to settle |A|=4, run the 2^6 brute\u2011force CSP per remaining macro\u2011profile (using Lemmas T/D/P to restrict profiles) and archive either SAT witnesses or an UNSAT certificate."
