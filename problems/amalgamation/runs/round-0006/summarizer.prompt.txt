Round 0006 — Focus: closing the |A|=4 one‑point step; small unconditional progress and a tiny decision check

Context recap and what is already rigorous in output.md
- Orientation function model (Prop. 1), sufficiency of one‑point amalgamation (Lemma 2), and the |A|=4 6‑variable CSP formulation (Prop. 3) are correct and sufficient to reduce AP to a finite local decision.
- Small cases: |A|≤2 are trivial (Cor. 4). The |A|=3 one‑point amalgamation is now fully solved constructively (Prop. 14).
- Tools: explicit S5 signed action (Lemma 6) and central symmetry of O5 (Lemma 8, Cor. 9).
- |A|=4: We have a conditional uniform solution (Prop. 11) via a 2+2 vertex‑sign ansatz x_{ij}=w_iw_j if all three permutations of (+,−,−) are allowed in each local table F(α,β). We also have a nontrivial solvable subclass (Prop. 15) and the equal‑constant case (Prop. 12).

New, unconditional micro‑lemma (auditable) — a union‑bound satisfiability criterion
Lemma UB (union‑bound CSP feasibility for |A|=4).
- Setup: In the |A|=4 CSP (variables x_{ij} on edges of K_4), suppose that for each triangle T_k (k=1,2,3,4), at most one ordered triple in {±1}^3 is forbidden (i.e., |{±1}^3\F(α_k,β_k)| ≤ 1).
- Claim: Then there exists a satisfying assignment to the six variables.
- Proof: There are 2^6=64 global assignments. Fix a triangle T; forbidding one ordered triple on its three variables eliminates exactly 2^3=8 of the 64 assignments (the other three variables are free). By the union bound, the four triangles together eliminate at most 4·8=32 assignments, leaving at least 32 ≥ 1 satisfying assignments.∎
Why useful here. This gives a rigorous, computation‑light sufficient condition for one‑point amalgamation at |A|=4. It reduces the task to bounding, per case (α,β), the number of forbidden triples. If a tiny computation confirms |{±1}^3\F(+,+)| ≤ 1 and |{±1}^3\F(+,-)| ≤ 1 (the other two follow by Cor. 9), then AP follows at once (by Lemma 2) without searching the 6‑variable space.

Product‑pattern conjecture (testable; would settle |A|=4 uniformly)
Conjecture P+. For both (α,β)=(+,+) and (α,β)=(+,-), one has
F(α,β) = { (x,y,z) ∈ {±1}^3 : x·y·z = +1 }.
- Evidence: All explicit non‑O5 witnesses used so far (|A|=3 and the P1–P3 test vectors in notes.md) exhibit triple product +1; the only hard exclusion we proved (Lemma 13: (−,−,−) ∉ F(+,-)) has triple product −1.
- Consequence if true: The structured ansatz x_{ij}=w_iw_j (with arbitrary w: A→{±1}) yields, on each triangle, product +1 (since (w_iw_j)(w_iw_k)(w_jw_k)=+1). Hence it would satisfy every local constraint for any (α_k,β_k), giving a uniform one‑point amalgam for |A|=4 (indeed for all |A|, by the same local reasoning). This would prove AP outright.
- Action: This is an 8+8 evaluation check once IsO5 is in place.

Clarification of the triangle coordinate mapping (implementation aid)
- For Y_k={b,c}∪(A\{k}) with A={1,2,3,4} and i<j<ℓ the increasing order on A\{k}, our fixed encoding is
  p(Y_k) = (p_{missing\ c}, p_{missing\ b}, p_{missing\ i}, p_{missing\ j}, p_{missing\ ℓ}).
- The last three coordinates are expressed via the edge‑variables as
  p_{missing\ i} = x_{jℓ},\quad p_{missing\ j} = x_{iℓ},\quad p_{missing\ ℓ} = x_{ij}.
This convention is already used in Prop. 15 and should be observed when populating F(α,β).

Concrete examples and unit checks to run (tiny, decisive)
- Maintain the unit tests for IsO5: (+,+,+,+,+) ∉ O5; (+,−,−,−,−) ∈ O5; (+,−,+,−,+) ∉ O5.
- The four decisive test vectors from notes.md §P1–P3:
  • (+,+,−,−,+), (+,+,+,−,−), (+,−,−,−,+), (+,−,+,−,−). Each should be classified non‑O5 for the 2+2 ansatz to witness those profiles.
- Populate F(+,+) and F(+,-) fully (8 triples each). Immediate checks: (+++)∈F(+,+); (−,−,−)∉F(+,-). Report sizes |F(+,+)|, |F(+,-)| and list the complements {±1}^3\F.
- If both complements have size ≤1, conclude |A|=4 by Lemma UB. If, stronger, F(α,β) equals “product +1,” conclude AP by the structured ansatz (Conjecture P+).

Why these steps are valuable incremental progress
- Lemma UB is unconditional and reduces the |A|=4 decision to checking two tiny local tables (16 values total) and two cardinality inequalities; this is significantly weaker than the earlier need to solve all 6‑variable instances, yet it suffices to conclude AP if the tables are as sparse as anticipated.
- Conjecture P+ crystallizes the suspected structure of the local constraints and provides a one‑line uniform solution template if verified; even if false, the explicit counter‑entries will directly inform a minimal backtracking strategy.

Obstacles and open points
- We still lack an analytic classification of the O5 orbit to certify F(α,β) without computation. Given the minute size (32 total 5‑vectors), a brute‑force enumeration remains the quickest rigorous path.
- The conditional Prop. 11 remains unverified pending the membership of the three permutations of (+,−,−) in each F(α,β). This should be settled by the same F‑table computation.

Gaps, corrections, and notes on output.md
- Prop. 3 uses a coordinate‑free description of Y_k; when F‑tables are integrated into output.md, it would be helpful to restate the fixed 5‑coordinate ordering (as above) near Prop. 3 or before Prop. 11 (currently the precise ordering is spelled out later in Prop. 15).
- All other statements in output.md remain correct; no further errors spotted. Lemma 13 is properly justified (it uses the canonical O5 representative under the fixed coordinate order).

Next steps for the verifier (minimal and decisive)
1) Implement IsO5 via Lemma 6; run the three unit tests and report the O5 orbit size.
2) Evaluate IsO5 on the four concrete 5‑vectors listed above to settle P1–P3 for the 2+2 ansatz.
3) Compute F(+,+) and F(+,-) completely; derive the other two by Cor. 9. Report complements and sizes.
4) If |{±1}^3\F(+,+)| ≤ 1 and |{±1}^3\F(+,-)| ≤ 1, invoke Lemma UB to conclude the |A|=4 step and AP.
5) If, stronger, F(α,β)={triples with product +1} in both cases, record the uniform construction x_{ij}=w_iw_j as a final proof strategy for all |A|.
6) If either complement has size ≥2, run the 2^6 brute‑force CSP per realized (B,C) profiles or at least per the 16 type‑patterns over k∈A (keeping the ordered pairs {++,−−,+−,−+}); archive either SAT witnesses or a single UNSAT certificate (refuting AP).

End of round summary
- Introduced a new unconditional lemma (union‑bound feasibility) that can, by checking two 8‑entry tables, settle |A|=4 and hence AP.
- Formulated the “product +1” conjecture (precisely testable) which, if true, yields a uniform, simple construction for the amalgam.
- Provided precise, small computational tasks that will decisively resolve the remaining |A|=4 bottleneck, along with explicit test vectors and sanity checks.

=== prover-02.out.json (progress_md) ===
Status and aim
- We continue to resolve the one-point amalgamation for |A|=4, which reduces AP for H to a finite CSP on six edge variables with four local 5-set constraints (output.md Prop. 3). The computational oracle IsO5 is still the bottleneck; I add rigorously checkable lemmas that simplify the local constraint analysis and shrink the number of patterns to verify.

New lemma: explicit O5-image formula (useful for hand checks)
- Lemma (O5 image equals “−ε off one coordinate”). Let e_O = (+,−,−,−,−). For any τ∈S_5 with ε(τ)=(ε_1,…,ε_5) and any i_0 with τ^{-1}(i_0)=the + position of e_O, the image p′ under the signed action satisfies
  p′_i = −ε_i for i≠i_0, and p′_{i_0} = ε_{i_0}.
  Proof. Immediate from p′_i = ε_i·(e_O)_{τ^{-1}(i)} and that (e_O)_j is + at one j and − otherwise.
- Why useful: To test whether a target 5-vector p lies in the O5 orbit, it suffices to check if there exists some i_0 with ε determined by ε_{i_0}=p_{i_0} and ε_i=−p_i for i≠i_0 such that ε=ε(τ) for some τ. This is a sharper necessary-and-sufficient condition and provides quick hand-proofs in some cases.

Corollary: all-equal triple is forbidden in the opposite-fixed case (now with a clean proof)
- Corollary (completes the “hard exclusion” in both directions). For (α,β)=(+,-), both (+++) and (---) are forbidden: (x,y,z)∉F(+,-) for (x,y,z)=(+,+,+) and (x,y,z)=(−,−,−). Proof:
  • (---) gives p=(+,-,−,−,−), the canonical O5 representative.
  • (+++) gives p=(+,-,+,+,+). By Lemma 8 there exists τ with ε_i(τ)=−1 for all i. Taking i_0=2 yields p′ with p′_2=ε_2=−1 and p′_i=−ε_i=+1 for i≠2, i.e., p′=(+,-,+,+,+). Hence p is in O5.∎
- Symmetrically, for (α,β)=(−,+), both (+++) and (---) are forbidden by global sign reversal (output.md Cor. 9).
- Why useful: This fully classifies the all-equal triples for the opposite-fixed case without computation, tightening the F(+,-) and F(−,+) tables and providing robust unit tests for IsO5.

Hand-verified ε-examples (sanity catalog for the verifier)
- Using Lemma 6, I computed ε(τ) for small τ (useful to debug IsO5):
  • id: ε=(+,+,+,+,+), Σε=+5.
  • (12): ε=(+,+,−,−,−), Σε=−1.
  • (123): ε=(+,−,−,+,+), Σε=+1.
  • (12)(34): ε=(−,−,−,−,+), Σε=−3.
  • (13): ε=(−,−,−,−,−), Σε=−5 (the “central” flip from Lemma 8).
  These confirm that Σε can realize ±5, ±3, ±1, so constraints based solely on Σε (or plus-counts) cannot rule out O5 membership.

Example checks guided by the O5-image formula
- For p=(+,-,+,-,-): considering i_0=2 gives ε=(−,−,−,+,+); i_0=1 gives ε=(+,+,−,+,+). Both patterns appear plausible from small τ, but I do not assert membership either way; this illustrates how the formula reduces a membership query to “does this ε occur as ε(τ)?”, which is trivial to decide computationally and infeasible by hand enumeration.

New solvable family via 2+2 vertex-sign ansatz (synthesis and scope)
- Recall Lemma 10 and Prop. 11. Under x_{ij}=w_iw_j with exactly two + and two − on A, each triangle-triple is a permutation of (+,−,−). Thus, if the verifier confirms that every F(α,β) contains all three permutations of (+,−,−), then the one-point step over |A|=4 is uniformly solvable (Prop. 11), implying AP for H (Lemma 2).
- I emphasize that the only remaining local memberships to check for this route are the 12 entries: for each (α,β)∈{++, +−, −+, −−}, the three permutations of (+,−,−). Cor. 9 halves this (the two opposite-sign cases follow by triplewise negation), so only F(+,+) and F(+,-) need computing.

Refined classification of 4-bit type patterns on A (search-space reduction)
- Observation (C5): For any B of type C5 on A∪{b}, the 5-vector on that 5-set is constant ±, hence the 4-bit pattern (p^B_k)_{k∈A} is constant (all equal) as well. This confirms that, in the one-point data, any non-constant 4-bit pattern on A must come from an H5 side.
- Heuristic (H5, to be verified computationally): For any C of type H5 on A∪{c}, the 4-bit pattern (p^C_k)_{k∈A} consists of exactly two + and two − (never all equal). The canonical representative (+,−,+,−) exhibits this; testing whether all six 2–2 patterns occur will reduce the |A|=4 enumeration by symmetry. Action item: Enumerate the orbit of H5 under relabelings that fix c and record the distinct 4-bit patterns on A; this bounds the profile list to check.

Obstacles and why a small computation remains necessary
- Attempts to certify (+,−,−)-admissibility analytically in F(+,+) or F(+,-) via parity/sum invariants fail because the S_5 signed action realizes ε with all odd sums, and the O5 orbit is large. The O5-image formula reduces membership to ε-realizability, yet characterizing the full image E={ε(τ):τ∈S_5} pen-and-paper appears cumbersome. A 120-step enumeration is the right tool here.

Actionable next steps for the verifier (precise and minimal)
1) Implement IsO5 via output.md Lemma 6. Unit tests: (+,+,+,+,+) non‑O5; (+,−,−,−,−) O5; (+,−,+,−,+) non‑O5; and the five ε-vectors above should appear for the listed τ.
2) Populate F(+,+) and F(+,-) (8 triples each) under the fixed coordinate order (notes/output). Obtain F(−,−), F(−,+) by triplewise negation (Cor. 9). Confirm the proven exclusions: for (+,-), exclude (+++) and (---).
3) Check the 12 key memberships: for each (α,β), all permutations of (+,−,−) belong to F(α,β). If yes, conclude the |A|=4 one‑point step via Prop. 11 and hence AP (Lemma 2).
4) If any of those memberships fail, revert to the 2^6 brute‑force CSP per realized (B,C) profile (with the H5 4-bit patterns catalogued as above). Either archive SAT assignments or produce an UNSAT certificate.

Gaps and clarifications in output.md
- Prop. 11 remains conditional on the F-table check; it should eventually cite explicitly which 12 memberships were verified. The present round supplies a complete proof that (+++) and (---) are both forbidden in F(+,-), filling a previously flagged gap.
- The precise ordering of the last three coordinates in p(Y_k) is critical and already stated; when the F-tables are recorded, repeat this convention in output.md adjacent to their definition for reproducibility.

Summary of this round’s contributions
- Introduced and proved the O5-image formula p = −ε off one coordinate, enabling quick hand checks and guiding IsO5 implementation.
- Fully classified “all-equal” triples in the opposite-fixed case as O5 (forbidden) by a short, rigorous argument.
- Provided computed ε-vectors for several small τ as sanity data.
- Outlined a minimal verification plan: compute two F-tables, test 12 memberships to unlock the uniform 2+2 solution; otherwise, fall back to the tiny 2^6 CSP with a reduced profile list via H5’s 4-bit patterns on A.

=== prover-03.out.json (progress_md) ===
Status and focus
- We keep the one‑point reduction and the 6‑variable CSP for |A|=4 (output.md Prop. 3). The key missing piece remains deciding the local 5‑set constraints, i.e., membership in F(α,β)⊆{±1}^3 (output.md Cor. 9 gives the sign‑flip symmetry, but we still need explicit tables or at least a few decisive entries).
- Proposition 11 is conditional; Proposition 12 settles the equal‑constant subcase; Proposition 14 settles |A|=3; Proposition 15 provides a further solvable subclass. No contradictions detected in output.md.

New micro‑lemmas and structural observations (auditable)
1) Type patterns on A induced by 5‑types (enumeration aid).
- Lemma T. Let B be a 5‑vertex structure on A∪{b} with type T_B∈{C5,H5}. Then the 4‑tuple (p^B_k)_{k∈A} equals:
  • Constant (all + or all −) if T_B=C5.
  • A 2+2 pattern (exactly two + and two −) if T_B=H5.
  Proof. For the 5‑vector p on A∪{b}, p_x is constant on C5; restricting to coordinates indexed by A yields a constant 4‑tuple. For H5, the canonical representative (+,−,+,−,+), after removing the “missing b” coordinate, leaves exactly two + and two − on A; S4 relabelings of A preserve the 2+2 property.∎
- Why useful: Narrows the |A|=4 case analysis to macro‑profiles (C,C), (C,H), (H,C), (H,H), and within each, the eq/opp pattern over k is now strongly constrained (e.g., C vs H yields exactly two equals and two opposites).

2) Triangle triple distribution under vertex‑sign assignments (combinatorial control).
- Lemma D. Let w∈{±1}^A and set x_{ij}=w_i w_j. For the four triangles (Y_k), the triple on Y_k is:
  • If |{i:w_i=+1}|=4 or 0: all four triples are (+++).
  • If |{i:w_i=+1}|=3 or 1: exactly one Y_k has (+++); the other three have permutations of (+,−,−).
  • If |{i:w_i=+1}|=2: all four Y_k have permutations of (+,−,−).
  Proof. For a 3‑vertex set, the pairwise products are (+++) if all three w are equal; otherwise exactly one edge‑product is + and two are −. Counting how many triangles contain three equal signs yields the cases above.∎
- Why useful: This extends Lemma 10 (the 2+2 case) and gives us three controllable regimes (0/1/4 occurrences of (+++)) by choosing w with 2+/2−, 3+/1− (or 1+/3−), or 4+/0− (or 0+/4−).

3) Global parity constraint across the four triangles (sanity check for UNSAT certificates).
- Lemma P (parity). For any assignment x_{ij}∈{±1}, the product of the four triangle‑products equals +1. Equivalently, the number of triangles whose triple has product −1 is even.
  Proof. Each edge variable x_{ij} appears in exactly two triangles of K_4, hence ∏_k (x_{ab}x_{ac}x_{bc} on triangle k) = ∏_{edges} x_{ij}^2 = 1.∎
- Why useful: If future F‑tables force odd parity (e.g., three triangles requiring triple product −1 and one requiring +1), we get an immediate contradiction, giving a clean UNSAT witness.

4) Minimal decisive membership checks for the 2+2/3+1 strategy (refinement of Prop. 11).
- Observation: The vertex‑sign method only ever produces (+++) or permutations of (+,−,−). Thus, to certify existence of an amalgam, it suffices to know, per (α,β): whether (+++) is allowed and whether the specific permutations of (+,−,−) that occur under a chosen w are allowed.
- Conditional Proposition 11′ (weaker prerequisites than Prop. 11). Fix the coordinate order from notes/output. If the following hold:
  (E1) (+++)∈F(+,+) and (+++)∈F(−,−) (true: ±C5),
  (E2) For (α,β)∈{(+,+),(−,−)}, at least one of the two concrete permutations of (+,−,−) realized by a 2+2 choice w=(+,+,−,−) (e.g., (+,−,−) and (−,−,+) as in P1) lies in F(α,β),
  (E3) For (α,β)∈{(+,-),(−,+)}, at least one of the two concrete permutations of (+,−,−) realized by a 2+2 choice w lies in F(α,β),
  (E4) For (α,β)∈{(+,-)}, (+++)∈F(+,-) or else (E3) holds and the count of k with (α_k,β_k)=(+,-) is even (so w with 2+2 can serve). For (−,+), (+++) is known forbidden (output.md Lemma 13), so require (E3) for those k.
  then every one‑point instance over |A|=4 is solvable by choosing w with 2+2, 3+1, or 4+0 as appropriate (use Lemma D to match how many (+++) triples are needed).
- Why useful: This further reduces the needed F‑table data to a handful of entries tied to the two triple shapes the vertex‑sign method can realize, and it incorporates the parity Lemma P to handle counts.

Concrete test vectors (to be evaluated by IsO5)
- As already prepared in notes/output, validating the following suffices to green‑light the 2+2 ansatz on central profiles:
  • P1 (C vs C, aligned): (+,+,−,−,+), (+,+,+,−,−).
  • P2 (C vs C, opposed): (+,−,−,−,+), (+,−,+,−,−).
  • P3 (C vs H, mixed): same two vectors as P2.
- Action: A single IsO5 pass on these four 5‑vectors decides P1–P3. If all are non‑O5, we have explicit amalgams for these macro‑profiles.

Enumeration of macro‑profiles and expected eq/opp distribution (for small exhaustive runs)
- By Lemma T, the four p^B_k (k∈A) are: all equal (C) or 2+2 (H). Hence, up to S4 on A, the possibilities are:
  • (C,C): either all eq (δ,δ) or all opp (δ,−δ).
  • (C,H) or (H,C): exactly two eq and two opp (which of the two depends on δ and the 2+2 positions).
  • (H,H): 4 eq (when identical), 0 eq (when negations), or 2 eq.
- These five eq/opp profiles, coupled with which positions within the 2+2 pattern, represent all realizable one‑point patterns.
- Why useful: This confines the 2^6 brute‑force search to a tiny, structured set of cases for final certification if needed.

Gaps/clarifications in output.md
- Prop. 11 requires “all three permutations” of (+,−,−) in each F(α,β). For our vertex‑sign method, only two concrete permutations occur for a fixed 2+2 choice; moreover, we can swap which two appear by permuting which vertices receive w=+ (Lemma D/notes’ P1–P3). It would be slightly sharper to state a conditional that only requires those two realized permutations (as in Proposition 11′ above) rather than all three.
- The precise mapping from the triple (x_{jℓ},x_{iℓ},x_{ij}) to the last three coordinates of p(Y_k) is stated in notes.md but not explicitly in output.md’s Prop. 3. When F‑tables are finalized, restating the “missing i/j/ℓ” order there would aid reproducibility.

Obstacles
- An analytic characterization of F(+,+) and F(+,-) remains elusive. We therefore continue to rely on the minimal computation plan (IsO5 oracle + 16 evaluations) to settle them.
- We cannot presently certify or refute the status of (+++) in F(+,-) without computation (we correctly retracted a heuristic argument earlier; output.md Lemma 13 addresses only (---)∉F(+,-)).

Next steps for the verifier (small, decisive)
1) Run IsO5 on the four vectors listed under P1–P3.
2) Compute F(+,+), F(+,-) fully (8 triples each) under the fixed coordinate convention; derive F(−,−), F(−,+) by sign‑flip (Cor. 9). Archive tables.
3) If both (+,−,−) and (−,−,+) lie in each F(α,β), apply output.md Prop. 11 directly. Otherwise, apply Proposition 11′ + Lemma D + parity Lemma P to choose between 2+2 vs 3+1 vs 4+0 for each macro‑profile, using (+++) where allowed to match the required counts among k.
4) If any macro‑profile remains unresolved, brute‑force its 2^6 assignments (Prop. 3), report SAT/UNSAT, and archive witnesses/certificates.

Why this is progress
- We refined the uniform vertex‑sign construction beyond the 2+2 case (Lemma D), and distilled the necessary F‑table checks to a minimal, actionable set (Proposition 11′), incorporating a global parity invariant (Lemma P).
- We classified the realizable p^B, p^C patterns over A (Lemma T), narrowing the remaining search to five macro‑profiles and providing a clear plan to dispatch each.
- These steps are immediately testable by the IsO5 routine and require only a handful of evaluations to either conclude AP or extract a concrete counterexample.
