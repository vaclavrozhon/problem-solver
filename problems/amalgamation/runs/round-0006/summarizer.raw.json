A sharp O5‑image formula (p' = −ε off one coordinate) was proved to speed IsO5 membership tests. The 2+2 vertex‑sign ansatz (x_{ij}=w_iw_j) was sharpened: if certain (+,−,−) permutations lie in the local F(α,β) tables then Prop.11 yields a uniform solution; weaker, concrete prerequisites were distilled (Prop.11′). Structural lemmas (T, D, P) classify 5‑types as constant vs 2+2 on A, control which triangle‑triples appear under w choices, and give an even‑parity constraint on triangle products — all shrink the brute‑force search. A remaining, decisive computational task is to run IsO5 and populate F(+,+),F(+,−); note a discrepancy in the notes about whether (+++)∈F(+,−) (claimed excluded in one draft, later retracted), so enumeration is needed.
