  "feedback_md": "Overall assessment: We have solid incremental advances and one clear, rigorous new tool (the union\u2011bound feasibility lemma) plus a correct global parity invariant. There are, however, a couple of incorrect or unjustified claims that we must not carry forward.\n\nProver 01\n- Lemma UB (union\u2011bound CSP feasibility) is correct. The counting is sound: forbidding a single ordered triple for a fixed triangle eliminates exactly 2^3 global assignments; with \u22641 forbidden triple per triangle, \u226432 of the 64 assignments are excluded, hence a solution exists. This is worth elevating to output.md; I\u2019ve added a precise version and a corollary explaining how to conclude |A|=4 once the two base tables F(+,+) and F(+,-) have complements of size \u22641.\n- Conjecture P+ (F equals \u201ctriple product +1\u201d) is a clean, testable hypothesis. Keep it in notes; do not promote to output.md without computation.\n- The clarification of the triangle coordinate mapping is consistent with our fixed convention in output.md Proposition 15. Good to keep emphasized in notes.\n\nProver 02\n- The \u201cO5\u2011image formula\u201d specialized to e_O is a correct, immediate consequence of Lemma 6: for \u03c4 and i0 with \u03c4^{-1}(i0) the \u201c+\u201d position of e_O, one has p\u2032_i = \u03b5_i if i=i0 and p\u2032_i = \u2212\u03b5_i otherwise. This is useful for hand checks/debugging; I\u2019ve kept it in notes as an implementation aid.\n- The claimed corollary \u201cfor (\u03b1,\u03b2)=(+,-), both (+++) and (---) are forbidden\u201d is not proved. The argument incorrectly treats i0 as freely choosable for a fixed \u03c4 with \u03b5\u2261\u22121. In fact i0 is determined by \u03c4 via i0=\u03c4(1), and the specific \u03c4 from Lemma 8 need not satisfy \u03c4(1)=2. We retain only the rigorously proved exclusion (---)\u2209F(+,-) (output.md Lemma 13). The status of (+++) in F(+,-) remains to be decided computationally.\n- The sample \u03b5(\u03c4) vectors are welcome as unit tests, but they should be presented as checks for the IsO5 implementation, not as structural constraints.\n\nProver 03\n- Lemma D (distribution of (+++) vs permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212) under x_{ij}=w_iw_j) is correct and complements Lemma 10. I leave it in notes; Lemma 10 already covers the 2+2 case explicitly.\n- Lemma P (parity of triangle products) is correct and broadly useful. I\u2019ve promoted it to output.md.\n- Lemma T (\u201con C5 the 4\u2011tuple (p^B_k) is constant; on H5 it is 2+2\u201d) is false as stated. Counterexample: if the 5\u2011set is of type C5, then under the S5 signed action its 5\u2011vector equals \u03b5(\u03c4) for some \u03c4; taking \u03c4=(12) (as in the samples), \u03b5 can be (+,+,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212), which is not constant on the A\u2011coordinates. Please discard this classification; do not use it to prune cases.\n- Proposition 11\u2032 is a reasonable conditional plan (using 2+2/3+1/4+0 choices guided by which entries of F are allowed) but remains conditional; keep in notes only.\n\nWhat is now in output.md\n- Added Lemma (union\u2011bound feasibility) and its corollary (how to conclude the |A|=4 step once |{\u00b11}^3\\F(+,+)|\u22641 and |{\u00b11}^3\\F(+,-)|\u22641).\n- Added Lemma (parity across the four triangles).\n- No other structural changes; kept all previously proved items intact.\n\nNext steps (minimal, decisive)\n1) Implement IsO5 via Lemma 6; run unit tests: (+,+,+,+,+) non\u2011O5; (+,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212) O5; (+,\u2212,+,\u2212,+) non\u2011O5; and verify the \u03b5(\u03c4) samples listed by Prover 02.\n2) Populate F(+,+) and F(+,-) completely (8 entries each) under the fixed coordinate order. Derive F(\u2212,\u2212), F(\u2212,+) by triplewise negation (Corollary 9). Report complements and their sizes.\n3) If both complements have size \u22641, conclude the |A|=4 amalgamation by the union\u2011bound lemma and hence AP (via Lemma 2). If, stronger, both F tables coincide with \u201ctriple product +1\u201d, record the uniform construction x_{ij}=w_iw_j and close the problem.\n4) Otherwise, check whether all permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212) lie in F(+,+) and F(+,-); if yes, apply Proposition 11 (uniform 2+2 ansatz). If not, brute\u2011force the 2^6 CSP for the realized (B,C) profiles; use the parity lemma to prune and archive SAT/UNSAT witnesses.\n5) Optionally precompute the set E={\u03b5(\u03c4):\u03c4\u2208S5}. Then p\u2208O5 iff \u2203i0 with p_i=\u2212\u03b5_i for i\u2260i0 and p_{i0}=\u03b5_{i0} for some \u03b5\u2208E. This gives a very fast IsO5.\n",
  "new_notes_md": "New rigorous tools and corrections (to be used going forward)\n\n1) Union\u2011bound feasibility for the |A|=4 CSP\n- Statement. In the |A|=4 CSP with six edge variables x_{ij} and four triangle constraints Y_k, if for each k the local table F(p^B_k,p^C_k) forbids at most one ordered triple (i.e., |{\u00b11}^3\\F(p^B_k,p^C_k)| \u2264 1), then there exists a satisfying global assignment.\n- Reason. Each forbidden triple for a fixed triangle rules out exactly 2^3 global assignments (the other 3 edges are free). With at most one forbidden triple per triangle, at most 4\u00b72^3=32 of the 64 assignments are excluded. Hence at least 32 assignments remain.\n- Consequence. If a small computation confirms |{\u00b11}^3\\F(+,+)| \u2264 1 and |{\u00b11}^3\\F(+,-)| \u2264 1 (the other two cases follow by triplewise negation; Cor. 9), the |A|=4 step follows immediately without any 6\u2011variable search.\n\n2) Specialization of the S5 action to the O5 representative (implementation aid)\n- For e_O=(+,-,-,-,-) and \u03c4\u2208S5 with \u03b5(\u03c4)=(\u03b5_1,\u2026,\u03b5_5), let i0:=\u03c4(1). Then the image p\u2032 under the signed action satisfies p\u2032_i = \u03b5_i if i=i0 and p\u2032_i = \u2212\u03b5_i otherwise. Equivalently, p\u2032 is obtained from \u03b5 by flipping all coordinates except i0. Thus p\u2208O5 iff \u2203\u03b5\u2208E:={\u03b5(\u03c4):\u03c4\u2208S5} and i0 with p_i=\u2212\u03b5_i for i\u2260i0 and p_{i0}=\u03b5_{i0}.\n- Note. This enables a very compact IsO5: precompute E (120 evaluations) and check the 5\u00b7|E| candidates.\n\n3) Parity invariant across the four triangles\n- For any assignment x_{ij}\u2208{\u00b11}, the product of the triangle\u2011products over the four Y_k equals +1. Equivalently, an odd number of triangles cannot have triple product \u22121. Reason: each x_{ij} appears in exactly two triangle\u2011products.\n\n4) Distribution of triangle triples under vertex\u2011sign assignments\n- If x_{ij}=w_i w_j with w\u2208{\u00b11}^A, then on any triangle the triple is either (+++) (when the three w are equal) or a permutation of (+,\u2212,\u2212) (otherwise). In particular: 4+/0\u2212 (or 0+/4\u2212) yields four (+++); 3+/1\u2212 (or 1+/3\u2212) yields exactly one (+++); 2+/2\u2212 yields no (+++) and all four triangles are permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212).\n\nCorrections to prior claims\n- False: \u201cIf T_B=C5 then (p^B_k)_{k\u2208A} is constant; if T_B=H5 then it is 2+2.\u201d Counterexample: for a C5 5\u2011set, the 5\u2011vector equals \u03b5(\u03c4) for some \u03c4; e.g., \u03c4=(12) gives \u03b5=(+,+,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212), which is not constant on A. Do not use this classification to prune cases.\n- Unproved (and currently unknown): (+++)\u2209F(+,-). The argument that tried to force this from Lemma 8 incorrectly treats the free index i0. We keep only the rigorously proved exclusion (---)\u2209F(+,-) (output.md Lemma 13). The status of (+++) in F(+,-) must be decided computationally.\n\nCoordinate convention (reminder)\n- For Y_k={b,c}\u222a(A\\{k}) with A={1,2,3,4} and i<j<\u2113 the increasing order on A\\{k}, we encode p(Y_k)=(p_{missing c}, p_{missing b}, p_{missing i}, p_{missing j}, p_{missing \u2113}), with p_{missing i}=x_{j\u2113}, p_{missing j}=x_{i\u2113}, p_{missing \u2113}=x_{ij}.\n\nActionable checklist (minimal computation to unblock |A|=4)\n- Implement IsO5 using Lemma 6; validate unit tests: (+,+,+,+,+) \u2209O5; (+,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212) \u2208O5; (+,\u2212,+,\u2212,+) \u2209O5. Also verify the sample \u03b5(\u03c4) values listed in prior notes.\n- Compute F(+,+) and F(+,-) completely (8 triples each) under the fixed coordinate order; derive F(\u2212,\u2212), F(\u2212,+) by triplewise negation. Report sizes and explicit complements.\n- If both complements have size \u22641, conclude |A|=4 by the union\u2011bound lemma and hence AP via Lemma 2. If, stronger, both F tables are exactly \u201ctriple product +1,\u201d record the uniform construction x_{ij}=w_i w_j and close.\n- If not, test whether all permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212) lie in F(+,+) and F(+,-); if yes, apply Proposition 11 (uniform 2+2). Otherwise brute\u2011force the 2^6 CSP on the realized profiles, using the parity invariant to prune, and archive SAT/UNSAT witnesses.\n",

  "new_outputs_md": "Lemma 16 (Union\u2011bound feasibility for the |A|=4 CSP).\nIn the |A|=4 one\u2011point CSP (Proposition 3), suppose that for each k\u2208{1,2,3,4} the local table forbids at most one ordered triple, i.e., |{\u00b11}^3\\F(p^B_k,p^C_k)| \u2264 1. Then there exists an assignment to the six variables x_{ij} that satisfies all four constraints (so an amalgam in H exists).\n\nProof. There are 2^6=64 global assignments to the six variables. Fix k and a forbidden ordered triple t on its three local variables; the set of global assignments inducing t on that triangle has size 2^3 (the other three edge\u2011variables are free). Thus forbidding at most one triple per triangle eliminates at most 4\u00b72^3=32 global assignments in total. Therefore at least 64\u221232=32 assignments remain that satisfy all four local constraints. \u220e\n\nCorollary 16.1 (A small\u2011table criterion for the |A|=4 step).\nIf the two base tables satisfy |{\u00b11}^3\\F(+,+)| \u2264 1 and |{\u00b11}^3\\F(+,-)| \u2264 1 (so, by Corollary 9, the same holds for F(\u2212,\u2212) and F(\u2212,+) by triplewise negation), then for every one\u2011point diagram over |A|=4 there exists an amalgam D\u2208H.\n\nProof. For any instance, each Y_k uses one of the four pairs (p^B_k,p^C_k)\u2208{++,\u2212\u2212,+\u2212,\u2212+}; by the stated hypothesis and Corollary 9, each corresponding table forbids at most one triple. Apply Lemma 16. \u220e\n\nLemma 17 (Global parity constraint across the four triangles).\nIn the |A|=4 CSP, for any assignment x_{ij}\u2208{\u00b11}, the product of the triangle\u2011products over the four Y_k equals +1. Equivalently, an odd number of triangles cannot have triple\u2011product \u22121.\n\nProof. Each triangle\u2011product equals the product of its three edge\u2011variables. Multiplying the four triangle\u2011products together, each edge\u2011variable x_{ij} appears exactly twice (in the two triangles omitting i and j), hence contributes x_{ij}^2=1 to the total product. Therefore the total product is +1. \u220e",
