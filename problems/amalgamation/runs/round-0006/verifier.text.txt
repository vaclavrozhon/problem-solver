{"feedback_md":"Overall assessment: We have solid incremental advances and one clear, rigorous new tool (the union‑bound feasibility lemma) plus a correct global parity invariant. There are, however, a couple of incorrect or unjustified claims that we must not carry forward.\n\nProver 01\n- Lemma UB (union‑bound CSP feasibility) is correct. The counting is sound: forbidding a single ordered triple for a fixed triangle eliminates exactly 2^3 global assignments; with ≤1 forbidden triple per triangle, ≤32 of the 64 assignments are excluded, hence a solution exists. This is worth elevating to output.md; I’ve added a precise version and a corollary explaining how to conclude |A|=4 once the two base tables F(+,+) and F(+,-) have complements of size ≤1.\n- Conjecture P+ (F equals “triple product +1”) is a clean, testable hypothesis.

Good to keep emphasized in notes.\n\nProver 02\n- The “O5‑image formula” specialized to e_O is a correct, immediate consequence of Lemma 6: for τ and i0 with τ^{-1}(i0) the “+” position of e_O, one has p′_i = ε_i if i=i0 and p′_i = −ε_i otherwise. This is useful for hand checks/debugging; I’ve kept it in notes as an implementation aid.\n- The claimed corollary “for (α,β)=(+,-), both (+++) and (---) are forbidden” is not proved. The argument incorrectly treats i0 as freely choosable for a fixed τ with ε≡−1. In fact i0 is determined by τ via i0=τ(1), and the specific τ from Lemma 8 need not satisfy τ(1)=2. We retain only the rigorously proved exclusion (---)∉F(+,-) (output.md Lemma 13). The status of (+++) in F(+,-) remains to be decided computationally.\n- The sample ε(τ) vectors are welcome as unit tests, but they should be presented as checks for the IsO5 implementation, not as structural constraints.\n\nProver 03\n- Lemma D (distribution of (+++) vs permutations of (+,−,−) under x_{ij}=w_iw_j) is correct and complements Lemma 10.

I’ve promoted it to output.md.\n- Lemma T (“on C5 the 4‑tuple (p^B_k) is constant; on H5 it is 2+2”) is false as stated. Counterexample: if the 5‑set is of type C5, then under the S5 signed action its 5‑vector equals ε(τ) for some τ; taking τ=(12) (as in the samples), ε can be (+,+,−,−,−), which is not constant on the A‑coordinates.

In the |A|=4 CSP with six edge variables x_{ij} and four triangle constraints Y_k, if for each k the local table F(p^B_k,p^C_k) forbids at most one ordered triple (i.e., |{±1}^3\\F(p^B_k,p^C_k)| ≤ 1), then there exists a satisfying global assignment.\n- Reason. Each forbidden triple for a fixed triangle rules out exactly 2^3 global assignments (the other 3 edges are free). With at most one forbidden triple per triangle, at most 4·2^3=32 of the 64 assignments are excluded. Hence at least 32 assignments remain.\n- Consequence. If a small computation confirms |{±1}^3\\F(+,+)| ≤ 1 and |{±1}^3\\F(+,-)| ≤ 1 (the other two cases follow by triplewise negation; Cor. 9), the |A|=4 step follows immediately without any 6‑variable search.\n\n2) Specialization of the S5 action to the O5 representative (implementation aid)\n- For e_O=(+,-,-,-,-) and τ∈S5 with ε(τ)=(ε_1,…,ε_5), let i0:=τ(1). Then the image p′ under the signed action satisfies p′_i = ε_i if i=i0 and p′_i = −ε_i otherwise. Equivalently, p′ is obtained from ε by flipping all coordinates except i0. Thus p∈O5 iff ∃ε∈E:={ε(τ):τ∈S5} and i0 with p_i=−ε_i for i≠i0 and p_{i0}=ε_{i0}.\n- Note. This enables a very compact IsO5: precompute E (120 evaluations) and check the 5·|E| candidates.\n\n3) Parity invariant across the four triangles\n- For any assignment x_{ij}∈{±1}, the product of the triangle‑products over the four Y_k equals +1. Equivalently, an odd number of triangles cannot have triple product −1. Reason: each x_{ij} appears in exactly two triangle‑products.\n\n4) Distribution of triangle triples under vertex‑sign assignments\n- If x_{ij}=w_i w_j with w∈{±1}^A, then on any triangle the triple is either (+++) (when the three w are equal) or a permutation of (+,−,−) (otherwise). In particular: 4+/0− (or 0+/4−) yields four (+++); 3+/1− (or 1+/3−) yields exactly one (+++); 2+/2− yields no (+++) and all four triangles are permutations of (+,−,−).\n\nCorrections to prior claims\n- False: “If T_B=C5 then (p^B_k)_{k∈A} is constant; if T_B=H5 then it is 2+2.” Counterexample: for a C5 5‑set, the 5‑vector equals ε(τ) for some τ; e.g., τ=(12) gives ε=(+,+,−,−,−), which is not constant on A. Do not use this classification to prune cases.\n- Unproved (and currently unknown): (+++)∉F(+,-). The argument that tried to force this from Lemma 8 incorrectly treats the free index i0. We keep only the rigorously proved exclusion (---)∉F(+,-) (output.md Lemma 13).

Also verify the sample ε(τ) values listed in prior notes.\n- Compute F(+,+) and F(+,-) completely (8 triples each) under the fixed coordinate order; derive F(−,−), F(−,+) by triplewise negation.

Then there exists an assignment to the six variables x_{ij} that satisfies all four constraints (so an amalgam in H exists).\n\nProof. There are 2^6=64 global assignments to the six variables. Fix k and a forbidden ordered triple t on its three local variables; the set of global assignments inducing t on that triangle has size 2^3 (the other three edge‑variables are free). Thus forbidding at most one triple per triangle eliminates at most 4·2^3=32 global assignments in total. Therefore at least 64−32=32 assignments remain that satisfy all four local constraints. ∎\n\nCorollary 16.1 (A small‑table criterion for the |A|=4 step).\nIf the two base tables satisfy |{±1}^3\\F(+,+)| ≤ 1 and |{±1}^3\\F(+,-)| ≤ 1 (so, by Corollary 9, the same holds for F(−,−) and F(−,+) by triplewise negation), then for every one‑point diagram over |A|=4 there exists an amalgam D∈H.\n\nProof. For any instance, each Y_k uses one of the four pairs (p^B_k,p^C_k)∈{++,−−,+−,−+}; by the stated hypothesis and Corollary 9, each corresponding table forbids at most one triple. Apply Lemma 16. ∎\n\nLemma 17 (Global parity constraint across the four triangles).\nIn the |A|=4 CSP, for any assignment x_{ij}∈{±1}, the product of the triangle‑products over the four Y_k equals +1. Equivalently, an odd number of triangles cannot have triple‑product −1.\n\nProof. Each triangle‑product equals the product of its three edge‑variables. Multiplying the four triangle‑products together, each edge‑variable x_{ij} appears exactly twice (in the two triangles omitting i and j), hence contributes x_{ij}^2=1 to the total product. Therefore the total product is +1. ∎","new_outputs_append":"True","verdict":"partial success"}
