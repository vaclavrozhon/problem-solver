{"progress_md":"Round 0007 — Focus: sharpen O5-membership testing and prune local tables with rigorous tools; refine the |A|=4 search\n\nSummary of what is rigorous in output.md and remaining gaps\n- Proposition 1, Lemma 2, Proposition 3, Corollary 4, Fact 5, Lemma 6, Corollary 7, Lemma 8, Corollary 9, Lemma 10, Proposition 11 (conditional), Proposition 12, Lemma 13, Proposition 14, Proposition 15, Lemma 16, Corollary 16.1, Lemma 17 are internally consistent and correctly stated.\n- Remaining gap to settle AP: We still need the two base local tables F(+,+), F(+,-) and, consequently, a resolution of the |A|=4 one‑point CSP across the realized profiles. Proposition 11 remains conditional; Corollary 16.1 offers an unconditional route if both complements are ≤1, but this awaits the tiny computation.\n- A useful characterization of O5 membership (the “Hamming‑1” criterion; see Lemma H1 below) is not yet recorded in output.md. It reduces orbit membership to a radius‑1 Hamming neighborhood test around the set E={ε(τ):τ∈S5}. This should be added later for transparency (do not edit output.md now).\n\nNew micro‑lemma (rigorous) — Hamming‑1 characterization of the O5 orbit (implementation aid)\nLemma H1 (O5 as Hamming distance 1 from E).\n- Let e_O=(+,-,-,-,-) and E:={ε(τ):τ∈S_5} with ε(τ) as in Lemma 6. Then for p∈{±1}^5,\n  p∈O5 if and only if there exist ε∈E and i0∈{1,…,5} such that, writing q:=-p, one has Hamming(q,ε)=1 with the unique discrepancy at i0.\n- Equivalently, O5 = { flip_all_but_one(ε,i0) : ε∈E, i0∈[5] }, where flip_all_but_one(ε,i0) is the 5‑vector v with v_{i0}=ε_{i0} and v_i=−ε_i for i≠i0.\nProof. By the specialization of the action to e_O: R_τ(e_O) has coordinates p′_i = ε_i(τ)·(e_O)_{τ^{-1}(i)}; if j=τ^{-1}(i) equals the unique + position of e_O, then p′_i=ε_i(τ), and otherwise p′_i=−ε_i(τ). Writing i0:=τ(1), we obtain exactly p′=flip_all_but_one(ε(τ),i0). Conversely, any vector of this form is R_τ(e_O) for the corresponding τ. Rewriting as q:=-p yields the Hamming‑1 characterization. ∎\nWhy useful. For an IsO5 oracle, it suffices to precompute E (120 evaluations via Lemma 6) and then test membership of −p in the radius‑1 Hamming neighborhood of E. This is faster and more robust than building the full O5 orbit, and supports hand checks.\n\nConcrete consequences and hand checks (auditable)\n- Sanity: For p=(+,-,+,+,+), q=(−,+,−,−,−). If ε=all − were known to occur with i0=2, then Hamming(q,ε)=1 at 2 and p∈O5. We cannot assert “ε=all − with τ(1)=2” without computation (see Obstacles), so we keep this as a tiny check for the IsO5 implementation, not as a claim.\n- Verified exclusions retained: (x,y,z)=(−,−,−) is forbidden for (α,β)=(+,-) (Lemma 13). By sign symmetry (Cor. 9), (+++) is forbidden for (α,β)=(−,+).\n- Verified inclusions (from |A|=3 constructive witnesses, Proposition 14): (+++)∈F(+,+); (−−−)∈F(−,−); (+,−,+)∈F(+,-); (−,+,−)∈F(−,+). These serve as base unit tests for the F‑table computation.\n\nRefined computational blueprint (minimal, decisive)\nA) Precompute E and implement IsO5 via Lemma H1.\n- Enumerate all τ∈S5; compute ε(τ) via Lemma 6; store E as a set of 5‑vectors.\n- IsO5(p): compute q=−p; return true iff ∃ε∈E with Hamming(q,ε)=1. Archive |E| and, optionally, the multiset of sums Σε_i (useful for diagnostics).\n- Unit checks: classify (+,+,+,+,+) as non‑O5; (+,−,−,−,−) as O5; (+,−,+,−,+) as non‑O5. Also verify sample ε(τ) vectors from notes (id, (12), (123), (12)(34), (13)).\n\nB) Populate the base local tables under the fixed coordinate order.\n- Compute F(+,+) and F(+,-) completely by evaluating the 8 triples each against IsO5 on p=(α,β,x,y,z). Derive F(−,−) and F(−,+) by triplewise negation (Cor. 9). Archive explicit lists and complements; report sizes.\n- Immediate validations: (+++)∈F(+,+), (−−−)∉F(+,-) as above. Keep an eye on the number of forbidden triples per table (Cor. 16.1 route).\n\nC) Decide |A|=4 one‑point amalgamation via two small routes.\n- If |{±1}^3\\F(+,+)| ≤ 1 and |{±1}^3\\F(+,-)| ≤ 1, invoke Lemma 16 + Cor. 16.1 to conclude the |A|=4 step and hence AP (Lemma 2).\n- Otherwise, run the 6‑variable CSP per realized profile (brute force over x_{ij}∈{±1}): for each assignment, build the four p(Y_k) and test IsO5; archive a SAT witness or an UNSAT certificate if found. Use Lemma 17 (parity) to prune: an odd number of triangles demanding triple product −1 is impossible.\n\nD) Optional but efficient: a backtracking solver with small branching.\n- Choose a triangle (say Y_4) and fix its triple (x_{12},x_{13},x_{23}) to one of the |F(p^B_4,p^C_4)| allowed patterns (at most 8 choices). Propagate to constraints on Y_1,Y_2,Y_3 via shared edges; backtrack when hitting an O5. With at most 8 initial branches and shallow propagation, this is typically faster than the naive 2^6 loop.\n\nImplications for the 2+2 vertex‑sign ansatz\n- The conditional Proposition 11 cannot be used until we certify memberships of all three permutations of (+,−,−) in each F(α,β). The Hamming‑1 criterion (Lemma H1) provides a crisp way to test the key instances; in particular, the four 5‑vectors listed in notes for P1–P3 should be tested immediately (they are built from permutations of (+,−,−) on the last three coordinates with (α,β)=(+,+) and (+,−)).\n- If any of those four classifies as O5, the uniform 2+2 ansatz fails for that profile (which is fine; Proposition 12 already solves the fully aligned (++++) case by a constant assignment). We then proceed with the general CSP or the backtracking solver.\n\nExamples to feed IsO5 (relisted for convenience; same coordinate order as output.md)\n- P1 (C vs C, aligned): check (+,+,−,−,+) and (+,+,+,−,−).\n- P2 (C vs C, opposed): check (+,−,−,−,+) and (+,−,+,−,−).\n- P3 (C vs H, mixed): check (+,−,−,−,+) and (+,−,+,−,−) (same as P2).\nOutcome of these four evaluations will immediately confirm or refute the 2+2 ansatz on these central profiles and guide the subsequent global search.\n\nWhy these steps are concrete, incremental progress\n- Lemma H1 gives a simple, exact O5‑membership test in terms of a precomputed set E and Hamming distance. It streamlines the IsO5 routine and enables hand checks in small instances.\n- The plan B/C/D consolidates earlier ideas into a minimal, decisive pipeline that either resolves |A|=4 via the small‑table criterion (Cor. 16.1) or via a tiny brute force/backtracking with parity pruning. This is auditable and easily implementable.\n- The explicit test vectors from P1–P3 remain the quickest sanity checks; their classification directly informs whether the 2+2 ansatz is viable anywhere beyond the equal‑constant subcase.\n\nObstacles and open items\n- We still lack an analytic description of E and, as a result, of the O5 orbit; computing E (120 entries) is the appropriate step.\n- Without the F‑tables, we cannot confirm or deny the “product +1” conjecture (Conjecture P+) or the stronger condition in Proposition 11.\n- Attempts to hand‑prove (+++)∉F(+,-) or to classify (+,−,−) in F(+,+) stumbled on the constraint i0=τ(1) in the O5‑image formula; these are best left to the IsO5 oracle.\n\nNotes on output.md (gaps/clarifications; do not edit now)\n- It would be helpful to add, after Lemma 6 or near the definition of O5, the Hamming‑1 characterization (Lemma H1) as a corollary specialized to the O5 seed e_O. This is already established in notes and will aid future readers.\n- The coordinate convention for p(Y_k) is clearly stated near Proposition 15; when the F‑tables are finalized, repeating that convention next to their definition will avoid confusion in reproducing the data.\n\nNext steps for the verifier (minimal, checkable)\n1) Build E via Lemma 6 and implement IsO5 using Lemma H1; run the unit tests and report |E|.\n2) Evaluate the four P1–P3 vectors; report their O5 status.\n3) Populate F(+,+) and F(+,-); derive the others via Cor. 9; report complements and confirm Proposition 14’s witness triples.\n4) If both complements are ≤1, conclude |A|=4 via Lemma 16 and AP via Lemma 2. Else, run the 6‑variable CSP (or the backtracking variant) on realized profiles; archive SAT witnesses or an UNSAT certificate if found.\n\nThis round’s deliverables\n- New Lemma H1 (O5=Hamming‑1 from E), with proof and implementation guidance.\n- A clarified, minimal computational plan prioritizing E and the two base F‑tables, and a compact backtracking alternative to the 2^6 brute force.\n- Retained and emphasized concrete test vectors (P1–P3) and parity‑based pruning for the |A|=4 search."}
