The small cases |A|\u22642 and |A|=3 are closed (Cor. 4, Prop. 14). We have two key tools now recorded: central symmetry (Lemma 8) and the global parity invariant across the four triangles (Lemma 17). The union-bound feasibility criterion (Lemma 16) gives a decisive small-table condition.\n- The remaining bottleneck is to populate F(+,+) and F(+,-) (and derive the other two by Cor. 9), and then either apply Lemma 16 or the 2+2 construction (Prop. 11) to finish |A|=4.\n\nNew micro-lemmas (auditable) \u2014 structure of \u03b5(\u03c4) and a cocycle\n1) Lemma 18 (\u03b5-cocycle for composition).\n- Statement: For \u03c4,\u03c3\u2208S5 and i\u2208{1,\u2026,5}, one has \u03b5_i(\u03c4\u03c3) = \u03b5_i(\u03c4)\u00b7\u03b5_{\u03c4^{-1}(i)}(\u03c3).\n- Proof: For p\u2032 = A_\u03c4(p) with (A_\u03c4p)_i = \u03b5_i(\u03c4)\u00b7p_{\u03c4^{-1}(i)}, we have (A_\u03c4A_\u03c3 p)_i = \u03b5_i(\u03c4)\u00b7(A_\u03c3 p)_{\u03c4^{-1}(i)} = \u03b5_i(\u03c4)\u00b7\u03b5_{\u03c4^{-1}(i)}(\u03c3)\u00b7p_{\u03c3^{-1}(\u03c4^{-1}(i))}. Since A_{\u03c4\u03c3}p has i-th coordinate \u03b5_i(\u03c4\u03c3)\u00b7p_{(\u03c4\u03c3)^{-1}(i)}, uniqueness of the action implies \u03b5_i(\u03c4\u03c3) = \u03b5_i(\u03c4)\u00b7\u03b5_{\u03c4^{-1}(i)}(\u03c3). \u220e\n- Why useful: Enables computation of all \u03b5(\u03c4) from the generators without recomputing c-counts; critical for a robust, fast IsO5 oracle.\n\n2) Lemma 19 (\u03b5 for adjacent transpositions).\n- Statement: For s_k=(k k+1) (k=1,2,3,4), \u03b5(s_k) has + at positions k,k+1 and \u2212 elsewhere, i.e., \u03b5(s_k)=(\u2212,\u2026,\u2212, + at k, + at k+1, \u2212,\u2026,\u2212).\n- Proof: s_k has exactly one inversion (between k and k+1). Its restriction to [5]\\{j} has odd sign iff j\u2208{k,k+1}, hence \u03b5_i(s_k)=sgn(s_k)\u00b7(\u22121)^{c_j} equals + at i=k,k+1 and \u2212 otherwise. This matches direct c_j counts (as checked in notes earlier). \u220e\n- Why useful: Supplies base \u03b5-vectors on generators; combined with Lemma 18 yields all \u03b5(\u03c4) by multiplying generators.\n\n3) Corollary (parity of the number of + in \u03b5(\u03c4)).\n- By Corollary 7, \u220f_i \u03b5_i(\u03c4)=sgn(\u03c4). Let m(\u03b5) be the number of + entries. Then (\u22121)^{5\u2212m(\u03b5)}=sgn(\u03c4), so m(\u03b5) is odd if \u03c4 is even and even if \u03c4 is odd. Useful as a sanity check for \u03b5 enumeration.\n\nCorrected and implementable IsO5 criterion (pair-set S)\n- O5-image formula (from notes) says: for e_O=(+,-,-,-,-), the image under \u03c4 is p with p_i = \u2212\u03b5_i(\u03c4) for i\u2260i0 and p_{i0} = \u03b5_{i0}(\u03c4) where i0:=\u03c4(1). Equivalently, for a given p, there exists \u03c4 with (\u03b5,i0)=(\u03b5(\u03c4),\u03c4(1)) such that p\u2299\u03b5 equals h(i0), the vector with exactly one + at i0 and \u2212 elsewhere.\n- Crucial correction: It is not enough to find i0 with p\u2299h(i0) \u2208 E={\u03b5(\u03c4)}; the pair (\u03b5,i0) must be realized by the same \u03c4 (i.e., i0=\u03c4(1) for \u03b5=\u03b5(\u03c4)). This invalidates the naive \u201c\u03b5-only\u201d test and explains the earlier false positive for p=(+,+,+,+,+) with \u03b5=h(5).\n- Implementation blueprint: Precompute the pair-set S = { (\u03b5(\u03c4), i0=\u03c4(1)) : \u03c4\u2208S5 } using Lemma 18 and generators s_k (Lemma 19), tracking i0 under right-multiplication: if \u03c4\u2032=\u03c4 s_k then \u03b5(\u03c4\u2032)_i = \u03b5_i(\u03c4)\u00b7\u03b5_{\u03c4^{-1}(i)}(s_k) and i0\u2032=\u03c4(s_k(1)). Then IsO5(p) is true iff \u2203(\u03b5,i0)\u2208S with p_i=\u2212\u03b5_i for i\u2260i0 and p_{i0}=\u03b5_{i0}. This avoids orbit-building and uses only a 120-pair membership test per query.\n\nHand checks and unit data (partial, to aid verification)\n- \u03b5 on generators (confirmed):\n  \u2022 \u03b5((12))=(+,+,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212),\n  \u2022 \u03b5((23))=(\u2212,+,+,\u2212,\u2212),\n  \u2022 \u03b5((34))=(\u2212,\u2212,+,+,\u2212),\n  \u2022 \u03b5((45))=(\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,+,+).\n- Quick \u201cnon-O5 by partial exclusion\u201d for two of the profile vectors using these \u03b5-samples:\n  \u2022 p1=(+,+,\u2212,\u2212,+): For the above \u03b5 and also \u03b5(id) and \u03b5((13))=(\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212), the match count |{i: p1_i=\u03b5_i}| is 4,2,0,2,3 respectively (never 1). This is not a proof of non-O5 (other \u03c4 could still work), but serves as a debugging checklist for IsO5. Please use the S-based oracle to decide decisively.\n  \u2022 p2=(+,+,+,\u2212,\u2212) similarly has match-counts 3,2,2,0,1 under the above \u03b5; again ambiguous and needs a full S-check.\n\nConsequences for F(\u03b1,\u03b2) computation\n- With the S-oracle in place, F(+,+) and F(+,-) are obtained by the 8 tests on p=(\u03b1,\u03b2,x,y,z). By Cor. 9, F(\u2212,\u2212) and F(\u2212,+) follow by triplewise negation. Unit constraints to verify:\n  \u2022 (+++)\u2208F(+,+) and (\u2212,\u2212,\u2212)\u2208F(\u2212,\u2212) (constant 5-vectors are \u00b1C5, non-O5).\n  \u2022 (\u2212,\u2212,\u2212)\u2209F(+,-) (output.md Lemma 13); by symmetry (+++)\u2209F(\u2212,+).\n- Two decisive targets (carry-over from last round): check whether (+\u2212\u2212)\u2208F(+,+) and (+\u2212\u2212)\u2208F(+,-). If both hold (for all three permutations under our fixed coordinate order), Prop. 11 resolves |A|=4 uniformly via the 2+2 ansatz.\n\nImplementation blueprint (refined, minimal)\n1) Build S via the cocycle:\n  - Start with \u03c4=id: \u03b5=+++++, i0=1.\n  - BFS over right-multiplication by s_k (k=1..4) using Lemma 18 to update \u03b5 and i0.\n  - Store S as a set of 120 pairs (\u03b5,i0). Sanity checks: parity of plus-count in \u03b5 matches sgn(\u03c4); S has size 120; sample \u03b5 above are present with their correct i0.\n2) Implement IsO5(p): return true iff \u2203(\u03b5,i0)\u2208S with p_i=\u2212\u03b5_i for i\u2260i0 and p_{i0}=\u03b5_{i0}. Unit tests: (+,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212) true; (+,+,+,+,+) false; (+,\u2212,+,\u2212,+) false.\n3) Compute F(+,+) and F(+,-) (8 entries each) under the fixed coordinate convention (notes/output). Derive the other two via Cor. 9. Report complements and sizes. If both complements have size \u22641, conclude |A|=4 by Lemma 16.\n4) If, stronger, all three permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212) lie in both F(+,+) and F(+,-), apply Prop. 11 to conclude |A|=4 by the 2+2 ansatz x_{ij}=w_i w_j.\n5) If either condition fails, brute-force the 2^6 CSP on the realized (B,C) profiles; use Lemma 17 to prune.\n\nGaps and clarifications in output.md (to address later; do not modify now)\n- It would be helpful to add Lemma 18 (\u03b5-cocycle) in output.md as an implementation lemma; currently Lemma 6 suffices but the cocycle substantially simplifies and stabilizes code.\n- The O5-image formula specialized to e_O and the necessity to track the pair (\u03b5(\u03c4), i0=\u03c4(1)) is only in notes; incorporating it in output.md would prevent misuse of \u201c\u03b5-only\u201d tests. We flagged the earlier incorrect simplification explicitly here.\n- Coordinate ordering for the last three entries of p(Y_k) is correctly fixed near Prop. 15; when F-tables appear, restating that ordering there will improve reproducibility.\n\nObstacles\n- A purely analytic classification of E={\u03b5(\u03c4)} (or of the O5 orbit) appears cumbersome; the cocycle+generator method is the right small computation.\n- Without the F-tables, we cannot certify the 2+2 ansatz or the union-bound criterion. These remain the decisive next computations.\n\nNext steps (concrete, minimal)\n- Verifier: Implement S via Lemma 18 and \u03b5(s_k) from Lemma 19; build IsO5 as above and run the standard unit tests.\n- Populate F(+,+), F(+,-); confirm the already-proved exclusions and record sizes of complements. If both complements \u22641, invoke Lemma 16 to conclude |A|=4 and AP. If, stronger, (+\u2212\u2212)-permutations are allowed in both, apply Prop. 11 to conclude AP via the 2+2 construction.\n- Independently, evaluate IsO5 on the four concrete 5-vectors from profiles P1\u2013P3 listed in notes/output; archive their classifications and, if non-O5, keep these as explicit witnesses for representative one-point instances.\n\nWhy this is incremental, auditable progress\n- We introduced two precise, easy-to-check lemmas (\u03b5-cocycle and \u03b5 on generators) that drastically simplify the O5 oracle and remove ambiguity in the \u03b5-factors.\n- We corrected a subtle but important pitfall (the necessity of tracking i0 alongside \u03b5 in O5 membership), providing a rigorous criterion based on the pair-set S.\n- We supplied partial hand checks and a concrete, minimal computation plan that will decisively settle the small F-tables and hence the |A|=4 step via Lemma 16 or Prop. 11.\n"
