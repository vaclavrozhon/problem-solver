The small cases |A|≤2 and |A|=3 are closed (Cor. 4, Prop. 14). We have two key tools now recorded: central symmetry (Lemma 8) and the global parity invariant across the four triangles (Lemma 17). The union-bound feasibility criterion (Lemma 16) gives a decisive small-table condition.\\n- The remaining bottleneck is to populate F(+,+) and F(+,-) (and derive the other two by Cor. 9), and then either apply Lemma 16 or the 2+2 construction (Prop. 11) to finish |A|=4.\\n\\nNew micro-lemmas (auditable) — structure of ε(τ) and a cocycle\\n1) Lemma 18 (ε-cocycle for composition).\\n- Statement: For τ,σ∈S5 and i∈{1,…,5}, one has ε_i(τσ) = ε_i(τ)·ε_{τ^{-1}(i)}(σ).\\n- Proof: For p′ = A_τ(p) with (A_τp)_i = ε_i(τ)·p_{τ^{-1}(i)}, we have (A_τA_σ p)_i = ε_i(τ)·(A_σ p)_{τ^{-1}(i)} = ε_i(τ)·ε_{τ^{-1}(i)}(σ)·p_{σ^{-1}(τ^{-1}(i))}. Since A_{τσ}p has i-th coordinate ε_i(τσ)·p_{(τσ)^{-1}(i)}, uniqueness of the action implies ε_i(τσ) = ε_i(τ)·ε_{τ^{-1}(i)}(σ). ∎\\n- Why useful: Enables computation of all ε(τ) from the generators without recomputing c-counts; critical for a robust, fast IsO5 oracle.\\n\\n2) Lemma 19 (ε for adjacent transpositions).\\n- Statement: For s_k=(k k+1) (k=1,2,3,4), ε(s_k) has + at positions k,k+1 and − elsewhere, i.e., ε(s_k)=(−,…,−, + at k, + at k+1, −,…,−).\\n- Proof: s_k has exactly one inversion (between k and k+1). Its restriction to [5]\\\\{j} has odd sign iff j∈{k,k+1}, hence ε_i(s_k)=sgn(s_k)·(−1)^{c_j} equals + at i=k,k+1 and − otherwise. This matches direct c_j counts (as checked in notes earlier). ∎\\n- Why useful: Supplies base ε-vectors on generators; combined with Lemma 18 yields all ε(τ) by multiplying generators.\\n\\n3) Corollary (parity of the number of + in ε(τ)).\\n- By Corollary 7, ∏_i ε_i(τ)=sgn(τ). Let m(ε) be the number of + entries. Then (−1)^{5−m(ε)}=sgn(τ), so m(ε) is odd if τ is even and even if τ is odd. Useful as a sanity check for ε enumeration.\\n\\nCorrected and implementable IsO5 criterion (pair-set S)\\n- O5-image formula (from notes) says: for e_O=(+,-,-,-,-), the image under τ is p with p_i = −ε_i(τ) for i≠i0 and p_{i0} = ε_{i0}(τ) where i0:=τ(1). Equivalently, for a given p, there exists τ with (ε,i0)=(ε(τ),τ(1)) such that p⊙ε equals h(i0), the vector with exactly one + at i0 and − elsewhere.\\n- Crucial correction: It is not enough to find i0 with p⊙h(i0) ∈ E={ε(τ)}; the pair (ε,i0) must be realized by the same τ (i.e., i0=τ(1) for ε=ε(τ)). This invalidates the naive “ε-only” test and explains the earlier false positive for p=(+,+,+,+,+) with ε=h(5).\\n- Implementation blueprint: Precompute the pair-set S = { (ε(τ), i0=τ(1)) : τ∈S5 } using Lemma 18 and generators s_k (Lemma 19), tracking i0 under right-multiplication: if τ′=τ s_k then ε(τ′)_i = ε_i(τ)·ε_{τ^{-1}(i)}(s_k) and i0′=τ(s_k(1)). Then IsO5(p) is true iff ∃(ε,i0)∈S with p_i=−ε_i for i≠i0 and p_{i0}=ε_{i0}. This avoids orbit-building and uses only a 120-pair membership test per query.\\n\\nHand checks and unit data (partial, to aid verification)\\n- ε on generators (confirmed):\\n  • ε((12))=(+,+,−,−,−),\\n  • ε((23))=(−,+,+,−,−),\\n  • ε((34))=(−,−,+,+,−),\\n  • ε((45))=(−,−,−,+,+).\\n- Quick “non-O5 by partial exclusion” for two of the profile vectors using these ε-samples:\\n  • p1=(+,+,−,−,+): For the above ε and also ε(id) and ε((13))=(−,−,−,−,−), the match count |{i: p1_i=ε_i}| is 4,2,0,2,3 respectively (never 1). This is not a proof of non-O5 (other τ could still work), but serves as a debugging checklist for IsO5. Please use the S-based oracle to decide decisively.\\n  • p2=(+,+,+,−,−) similarly has match-counts 3,2,2,0,1 under the above ε; again ambiguous and needs a full S-check.\\n\\nConsequences for F(α,β) computation\\n- With the S-oracle in place, F(+,+) and F(+,-) are obtained by the 8 tests on p=(α,β,x,y,z). By Cor. 9, F(−,−) and F(−,+) follow by triplewise negation. Unit constraints to verify:\\n  • (+++)∈F(+,+) and (−,−,−)∈F(−,−) (constant 5-vectors are ±C5, non-O5).\\n  • (−,−,−)∉F(+,-) (output.md Lemma 13); by symmetry (+++)∉F(−,+).\\n- Two decisive targets (carry-over from last round): check whether (+−−)∈F(+,+) and (+−−)∈F(+,-). If both hold (for all three permutations under our fixed coordinate order), Prop. 11 resolves |A|=4 uniformly via the 2+2 ansatz.\\n\\nImplementation blueprint (refined, minimal)\\n1) Build S via the cocycle:\\n  - Start with τ=id: ε=+++++, i0=1.\\n  - BFS over right-multiplication by s_k (k=1..4) using Lemma 18 to update ε and i0.\\n  - Store S as a set of 120 pairs (ε,i0). Sanity checks: parity of plus-count in ε matches sgn(τ); S has size 120; sample ε above are present with their correct i0.\\n2) Implement IsO5(p): return true iff ∃(ε,i0)∈S with p_i=−ε_i for i≠i0 and p_{i0}=ε_{i0}. Unit tests: (+,−,−,−,−) true; (+,+,+,+,+) false; (+,−,+,−,+) false.\\n3) Compute F(+,+) and F(+,-) (8 entries each) under the fixed coordinate convention (notes/output). Derive the other two via Cor. 9. Report complements and sizes. If both complements have size ≤1, conclude |A|=4 by Lemma 16.\\n4) If, stronger, all three permutations of (+,−,−) lie in both F(+,+) and F(+,-), apply Prop. 11 to conclude |A|=4 by the 2+2 ansatz x_{ij}=w_i w_j.\\n5) If either condition fails, brute-force the 2^6 CSP on the realized (B,C) profiles; use Lemma 17 to prune.\\n\\nGaps and clarifications in output.md (to address later; do not modify now)\\n- It would be helpful to add Lemma 18 (ε-cocycle) in output.md as an implementation lemma; currently Lemma 6 suffices but the cocycle substantially simplifies and stabilizes code.\\n- The O5-image formula specialized to e_O and the necessity to track the pair (ε(τ), i0=τ(1)) is only in notes; incorporating it in output.md would prevent misuse of “ε-only” tests. We flagged the earlier incorrect simplification explicitly here.\\n- Coordinate ordering for the last three entries of p(Y_k) is correctly fixed near Prop. 15; when F-tables appear, restating that ordering there will improve reproducibility.\\n\\nObstacles\\n- A purely analytic classification of E={ε(τ)} (or of the O5 orbit) appears cumbersome; the cocycle+generator method is the right small computation.\\n- Without the F-tables, we cannot certify the 2+2 ansatz or the union-bound criterion. These remain the decisive next computations.\\n\\nNext steps (concrete, minimal)\\n- Verifier: Implement S via Lemma 18 and ε(s_k) from Lemma 19; build IsO5 as above and run the standard unit tests.\\n- Populate F(+,+), F(+,-); confirm the already-proved exclusions and record sizes of complements. If both complements ≤1, invoke Lemma 16 to conclude |A|=4 and AP. If, stronger, (+−−)-permutations are allowed in both, apply Prop. 11 to conclude AP via the 2+2 construction.\\n- Independently, evaluate IsO5 on the four concrete 5-vectors from profiles P1–P3 listed in notes/output; archive their classifications and, if non-O5, keep these as explicit witnesses for representative one-point instances.\\n\\nWhy this is incremental, auditable progress\\n- We introduced two precise, easy-to-check lemmas (ε-cocycle and ε on generators) that drastically simplify the O5 oracle and remove ambiguity in the ε-factors.\\n- We corrected a subtle but important pitfall (the necessity of tracking i0 alongside ε in O5 membership), providing a rigorous criterion based on the pair-set S.\\n- We supplied partial hand checks and a concrete, minimal computation plan that will decisively settle the small F-tables and hence the |A|=4 step via Lemma 16 or Prop. 11.\\n\"}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"auto","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"ProverOutput","schema_":{"properties":{"progress_md":{"description":"Append-only progress notes","title":"Progress Md","type":"string"}},"required":["progress_md"],"title":"ProverOutput","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":42496,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":15217,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":12672},"total_tokens":57713},"user":null,"store":true}
