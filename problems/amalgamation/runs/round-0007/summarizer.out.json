  "summary_md": "Round 0007 produced rigorous, implementable criteria for deciding O5\u2011membership and a concrete, minimal pipeline to finish the |A|=4 one\u2011point step. Two complementary oracle tests were given (a Hamming\u20111 reformulation and an inner\u2011product \u22123 test against the \u03b5\u2011set E), plus a cocycle and generator description of \u03b5(\u03c4) that makes enumerating E (and the stronger pair set S={(\u03b5(\u03c4),\u03c4(1))}) fast and auditable. A crucial correction was recorded: an \u03b5\u2011only test can give false positives \u2014 membership must use the paired i0=\u03c4(1) (the S\u2011oracle). Immediate rigorous exclusions in the local F\u2011tables were derived (e.g. (+++) \u2209 F(+,-) and all permutations of (++\u2212) are excluded from F(+,+)), which implies the union\u2011bound route cannot settle |A|=4. The round ends with a short, decisive computational blueprint: build S, implement IsO5, populate F(+,+)/F(+,-), then either apply the 2+2 ansatz (Prop. 11) or exhaust the tiny 6\u2011variable CSP with parity pruning.",
  "highlights": [
    "Two implementable O5 tests established: Lemma H1 (Hamming\u20111 around E) and Lemma 18 (inner product \u03a3 p_i \u03b5_i = \u22123 against E).",
    "A cocycle identity plus explicit \u03b5 for adjacent transpositions gives an efficient generation of E and hence the pair set S = {(\u03b5(\u03c4), \u03c4(1))}.",
    "Corrected pitfall: \u03b5\u2011only membership tests are insufficient; O5 membership requires matching a specific i0=\u03c4(1) \u2014 use S, not just E.",
    "Concrete local\u2011table exclusions derived: (+++) is forbidden in F(+,-); all three permutations of (++\u2212) are forbidden in F(+,+); symmetric statements hold for F(\u2212,\u2212).",
    "Consequence: Lemma 16 (union\u2011bound) cannot close |A|=4 here (complement size \u22653), so we must either confirm the 2+2 pattern in the F\u2011tables or solve the small CSP/backtracking with parity pruning."

  "next_questions": [
    "Compute and archive S (or E with paired i0) using the cocycle/generator method; report |E| and validate unit tests (classify the P1\u2013P3 sample 5\u2011vectors).",
    "Populate F(+,+) and F(+,-) completely; report complements and check whether the three permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212) (and (\u2212,\u2212,+)) appear in both tables \u2014 if yes, apply Prop.11 (2+2) to conclude |A|=4; otherwise run the 6\u2011variable CSP/backtracking and archive SAT/UNSAT witnesses.",
    "Add the inner\u2011product/Hamming\u20111 and cocycle lemmas to output.md later for reproducibility once computations are archived."
