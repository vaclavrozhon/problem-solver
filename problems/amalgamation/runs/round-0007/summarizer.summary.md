Round 0007 produced rigorous, implementable criteria for deciding O5‑membership and a concrete, minimal pipeline to finish the |A|=4 one‑point step. Two complementary oracle tests were given (a Hamming‑1 reformulation and an inner‑product −3 test against the ε‑set E), plus a cocycle and generator description of ε(τ) that makes enumerating E (and the stronger pair set S={(ε(τ),τ(1))}) fast and auditable. A crucial correction was recorded: an ε‑only test can give false positives — membership must use the paired i0=τ(1) (the S‑oracle). Immediate rigorous exclusions in the local F‑tables were derived (e.g. (+++) ∉ F(+,-) and all permutations of (++−) are excluded from F(+,+)), which implies the union‑bound route cannot settle |A|=4. The round ends with a short, decisive computational blueprint: build S, implement IsO5, populate F(+,+)/F(+,-), then either apply the 2+2 ansatz (Prop. 11) or exhaust the tiny 6‑variable CSP with parity pruning.
