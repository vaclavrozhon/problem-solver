{"summary_md":"Round 0007 produced rigorous, implementable criteria for deciding O5‑membership and a concrete, minimal pipeline to finish the |A|=4 one‑point step. Two complementary oracle tests were given (a Hamming‑1 reformulation and an inner‑product −3 test against the ε‑set E), plus a cocycle and generator description of ε(τ) that makes enumerating E (and the stronger pair set S={(ε(τ),τ(1))}) fast and auditable. A crucial correction was recorded: an ε‑only test can give false positives — membership must use the paired i0=τ(1) (the S‑oracle). Immediate rigorous exclusions in the local F‑tables were derived (e.g. (+++) ∉ F(+,-) and all permutations of (++−) are excluded from F(+,+)), which implies the union‑bound route cannot settle |A|=4. The round ends with a short, decisive computational blueprint: build S, implement IsO5, populate F(+,+)/F(+,-), then either apply the 2+2 ansatz (Prop. 11) or exhaust the tiny 6‑variable CSP with parity pruning.","highlights":["Two implementable O5 tests established: Lemma H1 (Hamming‑1 around E) and Lemma 18 (inner product Σ p_i ε_i = −3 against E).","A cocycle identity plus explicit ε for adjacent transpositions gives an efficient generation of E and hence the pair set S = {(ε(τ), τ(1))}.","Corrected pitfall: ε‑only membership tests are insufficient; O5 membership requires matching a specific i0=τ(1) — use S, not just E.","Concrete local‑table exclusions derived: (+++) is forbidden in F(+,-); all three permutations of (++−) are forbidden in F(+,+); symmetric statements hold for F(−,−).","Consequence: Lemma 16 (union‑bound) cannot close |A|=4 here (complement size ≥3), so we must either confirm the 2+2 pattern in the F‑tables or solve the small CSP/backtracking with parity pruning."],"next_questions":["Compute and archive S (or E with paired i0) using the cocycle/generator method; report |E| and validate unit tests (classify the P1–P3 sample 5‑vectors).","Populate F(+,+) and F(+,-) completely; report complements and check whether the three permutations of (+,−,−) (and (−,−,+)) appear in both tables — if yes, apply Prop.11 (2+2) to conclude |A|=4; otherwise run the 6‑variable CSP/backtracking and archive SAT/UNSAT witnesses.","Add the inner‑product/Hamming‑1 and cocycle lemmas to output.md later for reproducibility once computations are archived."]}
