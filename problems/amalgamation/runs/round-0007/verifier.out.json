  "feedback_md": "High-level assessment and triage\n- The core bottleneck remains the |A|=4 one\u2011point CSP. The right way to unblock it is to finalize a correct IsO5 oracle and then compute the two base local tables F(+,+) and F(+,-).\n- The most useful rigor this round is the pair\u2011set S criterion and the \u03b5\u2011cocycle/generator data (Prover 03). These are fully compatible with the action already recorded in output.md (Lemma 6) and give a clean, exact, and implementable IsO5 oracle without enumerating the entire orbit explicitly.\n\nMain correctness issues\n- Prover 01\u2019s Lemma H1 (\u201cHamming\u20111 from E\u201d) and Prover 02\u2019s Lemma 18 (\u201cinner\u2011product \u22123\u201d) both characterize O5 membership using \u03b5 alone (i.e., E={\u03b5(\u03c4)}). This misses a crucial constraint: for e_O=(+,-,-,-,-), the image under \u03c4 is determined by the pair (\u03b5(\u03c4), i0:=\u03c4(1)). In general, not every combination (\u03b5,i0) with \u03b5\u2208E is realized by a single \u03c4. Therefore \u201c\u2203\u03b5\u2208E with Hamming(\u2212p,\u03b5)=1\u201d (equivalently, \u03a3 p_i \u03b5_i = \u22123) is at best a necessary test; it is not sufficient unless the associated i0 is also realized. Prover 03 explicitly corrected this and proposed the exact S\u2011based criterion; that correction should be adopted.\n- Because the \u03b5\u2011only tests are not sufficient, the corollaries proposed by Prover 02 (C1\u2013C3) cannot be accepted as rigorous without checking the (\u03b5,i0) pairing. In particular, the claimed exclusion (+++)\u2209F(+,-) needs verification via the S\u2011oracle; it cannot be concluded from dot products alone.\n\nWhat is rigorous and valuable now\n- \u03b5\u2011cocycle identity: \u03b5_i(\u03c3\u2218\u03c4) = \u03b5_i(\u03c3)\u00b7\u03b5_{\u03c3^{-1}(i)}(\u03c4). This follows cleanly from Lemma 6 and gives a stable way to generate all \u03b5(\u03c4) from generators.\n- Generator values: \u03b5(s_k) for s_k=(k k+1) has + at positions k,k+1, and \u2212 elsewhere. This is a straightforward computation from Lemma 6/c_j and is extremely useful for building E (and S) by BFS on the Cayley graph.\n- Exact O5 membership via the pair\u2011set S: Define S:={(\u03b5(\u03c4), i0=\u03c4(1)) : \u03c4\u2208S5}. Then p\u2208O5 iff \u2203(\u03b5,i0)\u2208S with p_i=\u03b5_i for i=i0 and p_i=\u2212\u03b5_i for i\u2260i0. This is precisely the specialization of the action to e_O and is both necessary and sufficient.\n\nConsequences for next steps\n- Build S (120 pairs) once by BFS over adjacent transpositions using the \u03b5\u2011cocycle and tracking i0 under right\u2011multiplication. Then implement IsO5 by a simple 120\u2011pair membership test per query. This removes the ambiguity present in \u03b5\u2011only heuristics.\n- With IsO5 in hand, compute F(+,+) and F(+,-) completely (8 entries each). Derive F(\u2212,\u2212) and F(\u2212,+) by global sign reversal (Cor. 9). Confirm the verified items already in output.md (e.g., Lemma 13: (---) forbidden for (+,-); and the |A|=3 constructive witnesses from Proposition 14) and explicitly decide contentious entries like (+++) for (+,-) and the permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212) for both (+,+) and (+,\u2212).\n- Depending on these tables: (i) If both complements have size \u22641, apply Cor. 16.1 to conclude |A|=4; (ii) If, stronger, all three permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212) lie in both F(+,+) and F(+,-), apply Proposition 11 (uniform 2+2); otherwise brute\u2011force the 2^6 CSP per realized profile, using the parity invariant (Lemma 17) for pruning.\n\nConcrete next\u2011round checklist\n1) Implement S via cocycle + generators; verify |S|=120 and sample \u03b5(s_k) values. Unit tests: (+,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212) is O5; (+,+,+,+,+) and (+,\u2212,+,\u2212,+) are non\u2011O5 (consistent with output.md). Use these as nonnegotiable checks of the action/implementation.\n2) Compute F(+,+) and F(+,-); report explicit tables and the sizes of their complements; confirm the witnesses from Proposition 14.\n3) Attempt the two decisive routes: Cor. 16.1 (small complements) or Proposition 11 (2+2). If neither applies, run the small backtracking/2^6 CSP per profile.\n\nSummary of curation decisions\n- Do not add the \u03b5\u2011only O5 criteria (Hamming\u20111 / inner\u2011product \u22123) to output.md; keep them as heuristics in notes with a clear warning about the missing (\u03b5,i0) pairing. \n- Add the \u03b5\u2011cocycle, the generator values, and the exact pair\u2011set S criterion to output.md; they are rigorous, implementation\u2011ready, and directly relevant to closing the remaining gap.",

Let A_\u03c1 denote the signed action from Lemma 6: (A_\u03c1 p)_i = \u03b5_i(\u03c1) \u00b7 p_{\u03c1^{-1}(i)}. Then (A_\u03c3 A_\u03c4 p)_i = \u03b5_i(\u03c3) \u00b7 (A_\u03c4 p)_{\u03c3^{-1}(i)} = \u03b5_i(\u03c3) \u00b7 \u03b5_{\u03c3^{-1}(i)}(\u03c4) \u00b7 p_{\u03c4^{-1}(\u03c3^{-1}(i))}.

Write \u03c4:=s_k. Using Lemma 6, \u03b5_i(\u03c4)=sgn(\u03c4)\u00b7(\u22121)^{c_j(\u03c4)} for j=\u03c4^{-1}(i). A direct count shows that c_j(\u03c4) is odd for j\u2209{k,k+1} and even for j\u2208{k,k+1}. Since sgn(\u03c4)=\u22121, this yields \u03b5_i(\u03c4)=\u22121 at i\u2209{k,k+1} and \u03b5_i(\u03c4)=+1 at i\u2208{k,k+1}. \u220e\n\nLemma 20 (O5\u2011image formula and exact pair\u2011set membership test).\nLet e_O=(+,-,-,-,-).

For (a)\u21d2(b): If p=A_\u03c4(e_O), then for i with \u03c4^{-1}(i)=1 one has p_i=\u03b5_i(\u03c4)\u00b7(+)=\u03b5_i(\u03c4), and for i with \u03c4^{-1}(i)\u22601 one has p_i=\u03b5_i(\u03c4)\u00b7(\u2212)=\u2212\u03b5_i(\u03c4).
