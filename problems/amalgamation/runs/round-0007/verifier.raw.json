The right way to unblock it is to finalize a correct IsO5 oracle and then compute the two base local tables F(+,+) and F(+,-).\\n- The most useful rigor this round is the pair‑set S criterion and the ε‑cocycle/generator data (Prover 03). These are fully compatible with the action already recorded in output.md (Lemma 6) and give a clean, exact, and implementable IsO5 oracle without enumerating the entire orbit explicitly.\\n\\nMain correctness issues\\n- Prover 01’s Lemma H1 (“Hamming‑1 from E”) and Prover 02’s Lemma 18 (“inner‑product −3”) both characterize O5 membership using ε alone (i.e., E={ε(τ)}). This misses a crucial constraint: for e_O=(+,-,-,-,-), the image under τ is determined by the pair (ε(τ), i0:=τ(1)). In general, not every combination (ε,i0) with ε∈E is realized by a single τ. Therefore “∃ε∈E with Hamming(−p,ε)=1” (equivalently, Σ p_i ε_i = −3) is at best a necessary test; it is not sufficient unless the associated i0 is also realized. Prover 03 explicitly corrected this and proposed the exact S‑based criterion; that correction should be adopted.\\n- Because the ε‑only tests are not sufficient, the corollaries proposed by Prover 02 (C1–C3) cannot be accepted as rigorous without checking the (ε,i0) pairing. In particular, the claimed exclusion (+++)∉F(+,-) needs verification via the S‑oracle; it cannot be concluded from dot products alone.\\n\\nWhat is rigorous and valuable now\\n- ε‑cocycle identity: ε_i(σ∘τ) = ε_i(σ)·ε_{σ^{-1}(i)}(τ). This follows cleanly from Lemma 6 and gives a stable way to generate all ε(τ) from generators.\\n- Generator values: ε(s_k) for s_k=(k k+1) has + at positions k,k+1, and − elsewhere. This is a straightforward computation from Lemma 6/c_j and is extremely useful for building E (and S) by BFS on the Cayley graph.\\n- Exact O5 membership via the pair‑set S: Define S:={(ε(τ), i0=τ(1)) : τ∈S5}. Then p∈O5 iff ∃(ε,i0)∈S with p_i=ε_i for i=i0 and p_i=−ε_i for i≠i0. This is precisely the specialization of the action to e_O and is both necessary and sufficient.\\n\\nConsequences for next steps\\n- Build S (120 pairs) once by BFS over adjacent transpositions using the ε‑cocycle and tracking i0 under right‑multiplication. Then implement IsO5 by a simple 120‑pair membership test per query. This removes the ambiguity present in ε‑only heuristics.\\n- With IsO5 in hand, compute F(+,+) and F(+,-) completely (8 entries each). Derive F(−,−) and F(−,+) by global sign reversal (Cor. 9). Confirm the verified items already in output.md (e.g., Lemma 13: (---) forbidden for (+,-); and the |A|=3 constructive witnesses from Proposition 14) and explicitly decide contentious entries like (+++) for (+,-) and the permutations of (+,−,−) for both (+,+) and (+,−).\\n- Depending on these tables: (i) If both complements have size ≤1, apply Cor. 16.1 to conclude |A|=4; (ii) If, stronger, all three permutations of (+,−,−) lie in both F(+,+) and F(+,-), apply Proposition 11 (uniform 2+2); otherwise brute‑force the 2^6 CSP per realized profile, using the parity invariant (Lemma 17) for pruning.\\n\\nConcrete next‑round checklist\\n1) Implement S via cocycle + generators; verify |S|=120 and sample ε(s_k) values. Unit tests: (+,−,−,−,−) is O5; (+,+,+,+,+) and (+,−,+,−,+) are non‑O5 (consistent with output.md). Use these as nonnegotiable checks of the action/implementation.\\n2) Compute F(+,+) and F(+,-); report explicit tables and the sizes of their complements; confirm the witnesses from Proposition 14.\\n3) Attempt the two decisive routes: Cor. 16.1 (small complements) or Proposition 11 (2+2). If neither applies, run the small backtracking/2^6 CSP per profile.\\n\\nSummary of curation decisions\\n- Do not add the ε‑only O5 criteria (Hamming‑1 / inner‑product −3) to output.md; keep them as heuristics in notes with a clear warning about the missing (ε,i0) pairing. \\n- Add the ε‑cocycle, the generator values, and the exact pair‑set S criterion to output.md; they are rigorous, implementation‑ready, and directly relevant to closing the remaining gap.\",\"new_notes_md\":\"O5 membership: exact S‑criterion vs. ε‑only heuristics\\n- Exact criterion (to be used for IsO5). Let e_O=(+,-,-,-,-), and define the pair‑set\\n  S := { (ε(τ), i0=τ(1)) : τ ∈ S_5 },\\n  where ε(τ) is as in Lemma 6. Then for p∈{±1}^5,\\n  p ∈ O5 ⇔ ∃(ε,i0)∈S such that p_i = ε_i for i=i0 and p_i = −ε_i for i≠i0.\\n  Equivalently, p is obtained from ε by “flipping all coordinates except i0,” with (ε,i0) realized by the same τ. This is the specialization of the action to e_O and is both necessary and sufficient.\\n\\n- ε‑only heuristics (use with caution). Two convenient tests are often useful but are not sufficient on their own:\\n  • Hamming‑1: Hamming(−p, ε) = 1 for some ε ∈ E := {ε(τ) : τ∈S_5}.\\n  • Inner‑product −3: Σ_i p_i ε_i = −3 for some ε∈E (equivalently to Hamming‑1).\\n  These conditions are necessary for O5 membership but not sufficient unless the unique discrepancy index i0 is consistent with i0=τ(1) for the same τ realizing ε. Hence, they can give false positives. Always validate by checking the pair (ε,i0)∈S.\\n\\nε‑cocycle and generators (implementation aids)\\n- Cocycle identity.

Derive F(−,−) and F(−,+) by triplewise negation (Cor. 9).

Let A_ρ denote the signed action from Lemma 6: (A_ρ p)_i = ε_i(ρ) · p_{ρ^{-1}(i)}. Then (A_σ A_τ p)_i = ε_i(σ) · (A_τ p)_{σ^{-1}(i)} = ε_i(σ) · ε_{σ^{-1}(i)}(τ) · p_{τ^{-1}(σ^{-1}(i))}. On the other hand, A_{σ∘τ} p has i‑th coordinate ε_i(σ∘τ) · p_{(σ∘τ)^{-1}(i)}. Uniqueness of the action implies ε_i(σ∘τ) = ε_i(σ) · ε_{σ^{-1}(i)}(τ). ∎\\n\\nLemma 19 (ε for adjacent transpositions).\\nFor s_k=(k k+1) with k∈{1,2,3,4}, the vector ε(s_k) has entries + at positions k and k+1 and − at the other three positions.\\n\\nProof. Write τ:=s_k. Using Lemma 6, ε_i(τ)=sgn(τ)·(−1)^{c_j(τ)} for j=τ^{-1}(i). A direct count shows that c_j(τ) is odd for j∉{k,k+1} and even for j∈{k,k+1}. Since sgn(τ)=−1, this yields ε_i(τ)=−1 at i∉{k,k+1} and ε_i(τ)=+1 at i∈{k,k+1}. ∎\\n\\nLemma 20 (O5‑image formula and exact pair‑set membership test).\\nLet e_O=(+,-,-,-,-). Define the pair‑set S:={ (ε(τ), i0=τ(1)) : τ∈S_5 }. For p∈{±1}^5, the following are equivalent:\\n(a) p lies in the O5 orbit (i.e., p = A_τ(e_O) for some τ∈S_5).\\n(b) There exists (ε,i0)∈S such that p_i=ε_i for i=i0 and p_i=−ε_i for i≠i0.\\nEquivalently, p is obtained from ε by flipping all coordinates except i0, with (ε,i0) realized by the same τ.\\n\\nProof. For (a)⇒(b): If p=A_τ(e_O), then for i with τ^{-1}(i)=1 one has p_i=ε_i(τ)·(+)=ε_i(τ), and for i with τ^{-1}(i)≠1 one has p_i=ε_i(τ)·(−)=−ε_i(τ). Writing i0:=τ(1) gives (b). For (b)⇒(a): Given (ε,i0)∈S, pick τ with ε(τ)=ε and τ(1)=i0. The same computation shows A_τ(e_O)=p. ∎\",\"new_outputs_append\":\"True\",\"verdict\":\"partial success\"}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"auto","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"VerifierNewSchema","schema_":{"properties":{"feedback_md":{"title":"Feedback Md","type":"string"},"new_notes_md":{"title":"New Notes Md","type":"string"},"new_notes_append":{"title":"New Notes Append","type":"string"},"new_outputs_md":{"title":"New Outputs Md","type":"string"},"new_outputs_append":{"title":"New Outputs Append","type":"string"},"verdict":{"title":"Verdict","type":"string"}},"required":["feedback_md","new_notes_md","new_notes_append","new_outputs_md","new_outputs_append","verdict"],"title":"VerifierNewSchema","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":21778,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":27168,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":24192},"total_tokens":48946},"user":null,"store":true}
