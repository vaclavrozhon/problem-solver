An n-hypertournament is a structure with one n-ary relation R which is injective (that is, there are no tuples with repeated occurrences of vertices in R) such that every substructure on n vertices is preserved precisely by the even permutations. In other words, a structure (A,R), where R is an n-ary relation, is an n-hypertournament if the following three conditions are satisfied:

1) If (x_1, ..., x_n) \in R then x_1, ..., x_n are pairwise distinct.
2) If (x_1, ..., x_n) \in R and \sigma is an even permutation of {1,...,n} then (x_{\sigma(1)}, ..., x_{\sigma(n)}) \in R.
3) For every distinct x_1, x_2, ..., x_n of A it holds that exactly one of (x_1, x_2, x_3, ..., x_n) and (x_2, x_1, x_3, ..., x_n) is in R.

Now, given an n-hypertournament (A,R) with vertex set A = {1,...,n+1}, one can concisely describe it by recording for which i \in A it holds that the tuple (1,...,i-1,i+1,...,n+1), which contains all vertices of A except i in the natural order, is in the relation R; we call these the POSITIVE vertices. It turns out that there are only a few (namely ceil((n+2)/2)) isomorphism types of n-hypertournaments on n+1 vertices. For n = 4, they are the following three (we assume that their vertex set is {1,...,n+1} and, in accordance with the previous sentence, we describe them by the set of positive vertices):

1) C_5, for which the set of positive vertices is empty. (Note, however, that with a different enumeration, one could also describe C_5 by having all vertices positive, or for example by having precisely positive vertices {1,2}, and there are many more possibilities, all of which are isomorphic as 4-hypertournaments.)
2) O_5, for which only the vertex 2 is positive. (Again, there are many more descriptions based on what enumeration of the vertex set one chooses.)
3) H_5, for which the set of positive vertices is {1,3,5} (equivalently, one could also have the set of positive vertices be {2,4}, these are the only possibilities).

Next, let H be the class of all finite 4-hypertournaments with no substructure isomorphic to O_5. Your task is to decide whether H has the amalgamation property. That is, is the following statement true:

For every A, B, C in H such that A is an (induced) substructure of B and C and B \cap C = A (that is, B and C only share vertices of A) is there D in H such that both B and C are substructures of D (that is, the inclusions are embeddings, so note in particular that A is also a substructure of D and that the copies of B and C in D "overlap" at least over A).

=== progress.md ===
...
p-vectors that appear (up to relabeling across Y_k) are exactly the same as in P2: (+,−,−,−,+) and (+,−,+,−,−). If these are non-O_5 (as per the P2 check), this assignment also witnesses an amalgam for P3.

These four concrete 5-vectors are a minimal, auditable set for the verifier to run through IsO5. If all are non-O_5, the 2+2 ansatz settles three central profiles at once.

A further solvable family (explicit constraints linking α,β across k)
- Construction pattern: For each Y_k prescribe its triple to be (α_k,β_k,α_k) (the “local H5 witness” pattern used to solve |A|=3). Consistency across the four Y_k’s (because edge-variables are shared) forces the following equalities on the type-data:
  • α_1=α_2=α_3=α_4.
  • β_1=α_3 (hence β_1=α_1) and β_4=α_2 (hence β_4=α_1).
  • β_2=β_3.
- If these hold for a given pair (B,C), then defining x_{ij} by this pattern yields, for each k, p(Y_k) equal to ±C_5 (if α_k=β_k) or H_5 (if α_k≠β_k), hence an amalgam in H.
- Why useful: This provides a nontrivial, checkable subclass of one-point instances (beyond the equal-constant case of Proposition 12) that are solvable by an explicit assignment. It also illustrates how shared-edge consistency interacts with local choices.

Ideas toward a uniform |A|=4 construction (analysis and obstacles)
- 2+2 vertex-sign ansatz: As recorded (Lemma 10), with x_{ij}=w_i w_j and exactly two plus and two minus on vertices, every triangle contributes a permutation of (+,−,−). Consequently, the uniform feasibility of this ansatz reduces to membership tests that all three permutations of (+,−,−) belong to F(α_k,β_k) for each k. This is precisely the conditional statement in Proposition 11.
- Without the F-tables, we cannot yet certify these memberships analytically. However, the concrete vectors in P1–P3 above are p(Y_k) images of such permutations and thus constitute decisive micro-tests for two of the four α,β-types: (++), (+−).
- Greedy/LLL thought: A random assignment to the six variables makes each triangle uniformly distributed over {±1}^3. If the complement set {±1}^3\F(α,β) has size ≤1 in all four local types, then the LLL (with dependency degree 3) would guarantee a satisfying assignment. Establishing such small forbidden-fraction bounds is equivalent to computing the F-tables, which remains the minimal necessary check.

Actionable next steps for the verifier (small, decisive computations)
1) Implement IsO5 using the ε-factor formula in output.md Lemma 6; run unit tests: (+,+,+,+,+) non-O_5; (+,−,−,−,−) O_5; (+,−,+,−,+) non-O_5. Report the size of the O_5 orbit under the signed S_5 action.
2) Check the four concrete 5-vectors listed above:
   - (+,+,−,−,+), (+,+,+,−,−) [Profile P1]
   - (+,−,−,−,+), (+,−,+,−,−) [Profiles P2, P3]
   If all are non-O_5 then the presented assignments witness amalgams for these profiles.
3) Compute the local tables F(+,+) and F(+,−) fully (8 triples each) under the fixed ordering convention. Derive F(−,−), F(−,+) by triplewise negation (Corollary 9). Archive the tables; this completes the data needed to:
   - finish |A|=3 formally (although we already supplied an explicit solution), and
   - apply Proposition 11 (if all permutations of (+,−,−) are present in each F) to resolve |A|=4 uniformly, or else run the small 2^6 brute-force CSP per type-profile.
4) If Proposition 11’s condition fails, perform the 2^6 brute-force search for all compatible (B,C) over A (or, at minimum, over the 16 eq/opp patterns modulo S_4 on A) using the F-tables. Either record a SAT assignment (proving one-point amalgamation in each case) or produce a concrete UNSAT certificate (which would refute AP).

Why this counts as incremental, auditable progress
- Closed the |A|=3 case completely with explicit assignments for each (α,β), requiring no computation.
- Provided concrete, small test vectors for three central |A|=4 profiles (aligned, opposed, and mixed). Verifying four 5-vectors against IsO5 will either provide immediate positive evidence (witnessing amalgams) or reveal a specific local obstruction to the 2+2 ansatz.
- Identified a nontrivial solvable subclass for |A|=4 via the “local H5 witness” pattern and spelled out the precise necessary equalities it imposes on the type-data (α_k,β_k).
- Consolidated the minimal computational tasks (IsO5, two F-tables) that now suffice to either complete a uniform proof via Proposition 11 or to drive a short brute-force resolution of the |A|=4 CSP across all patterns.

Obstacles and open items
- An analytic characterization of the F(α,β) tables (beyond the hard exclusion (−,−,−)∉F(+,-)) remains elusive; we appropriately defer to the tiny enumeration.
- The 2+2 ansatz success hinges on membership of all permutations of (+,−,−) in F(α,β); this must be checked. If it fails, we will pivot to full 2^6 CSP solving (still very small) and, if needed, extract a minimal counterexample.

Checklist for the next round (expected outputs)
- IsO5 orbit size and unit-test confirmations.
- Verdict on the four concrete 5-vectors: non-O_5 or O_5; if all non-O_5, record the P1–P3 amalgam witnesses.
- Full F(+,+), F(+,−) tables and derivations of the other two via sign-flip.
- Either: (i) confirmation that all permutations of (+,−,−) are present in each F(α,β), hence a uniform 2+2 solution for |A|=4; or (ii) a small list of remaining profiles with a brute-force SAT witness or a single UNSAT certificate (which would refute AP).

## Round 0006 — 2025-08-27T18:59:55.891338Z

Round 0006 — Focus: closing the |A|=4 one‑point step; small unconditional progress and a tiny decision check

Context recap and what is already rigorous in output.md
- Orientation function model (Prop. 1), sufficiency of one‑point amalgamation (Lemma 2), and the |A|=4 6‑variable CSP formulation (Prop. 3) are correct and sufficient to reduce AP to a finite local decision.
- Small cases: |A|≤2 are trivial (Cor. 4). The |A|=3 one‑point amalgamation is now fully solved constructively (Prop. 14).
- Tools: explicit S5 signed action (Lemma 6) and central symmetry of O5 (Lemma 8, Cor. 9).
- |A|=4: We have a conditional uniform solution (Prop. 11) via a 2+2 vertex‑sign ansatz x_{ij}=w_iw_j if all three permutations of (+,−,−) are allowed in each local table F(α,β). We also have a nontrivial solvable subclass (Prop. 15) and the equal‑constant case (Prop. 12).

New, unconditional micro‑lemma (auditable) — a union‑bound satisfiability criterion
Lemma UB (union‑bound CSP feasibility for |A|=4).
- Setup: In the |A|=4 CSP (variables x_{ij} on edges of K_4), suppose that for each triangle T_k (k=1,2,3,4), at most one ordered triple in {±1}^3 is forbidden (i.e., |{±1}^3\F(α_k,β_k)| ≤ 1).
- Claim: Then there exists a satisfying assignment to the six variables.
- Proof: There are 2^6=64 global assignments. Fix a triangle T; forbidding one ordered triple on its three variables eliminates exactly 2^3=8 of the 64 assignments (the other three variables are free). By the union bound, the four triangles together eliminate at most 4·8=32 assignments, leaving at least 32 ≥ 1 satisfying assignments.∎
Why useful here. This gives a rigorous, computation‑light sufficient condition for one‑point amalgamation at |A|=4. It reduces the task to bounding, per case (α,β), the number of forbidden triples. If a tiny computation confirms |{±1}^3\F(+,+)| ≤ 1 and |{±1}^3\F(+,-)| ≤ 1 (the other two follow by Cor. 9), then AP follows at once (by Lemma 2) without searching the 6‑variable space.

Product‑pattern conjecture (testable; would settle |A|=4 uniformly)
Conjecture P+. For both (α,β)=(+,+) and (α,β)=(+,-), one has
F(α,β) = { (x,y,z) ∈ {±1}^3 : x·y·z = +1 }.
- Evidence: All explicit non‑O5 witnesses used so far (|A|=3 and the P1–P3 test vectors in notes.md) exhibit triple product +1; the only hard exclusion we proved (Lemma 13: (−,−,−) ∉ F(+,-)) has triple product −1.
- Consequence if true: The structured ansatz x_{ij}=w_iw_j (with arbitrary w: A→{±1}) yields, on each triangle, product +1 (since (w_iw_j)(w_iw_k)(w_jw_k)=+1). Hence it would satisfy every local constraint for any (α_k,β_k), giving a uniform one‑point amalgam for |A|=4 (indeed for all |A|, by the same local reasoning). This would prove AP outright.
- Action: This is an 8+8 evaluation check once IsO5 is in place.

Clarification of the triangle coordinate mapping (implementation aid)
- For Y_k={b,c}∪(A\{k}) with A={1,2,3,4} and i<j<ℓ the increasing order on A\{k}, our fixed encoding is
  p(Y_k) = (p_{missing\ c}, p_{missing\ b}, p_{missing\ i}, p_{missing\ j}, p_{missing\ ℓ}).
- The last three coordinates are expressed via the edge‑variables as
  p_{missing\ i} = x_{jℓ},\quad p_{missing\ j} = x_{iℓ},\quad p_{missing\ ℓ} = x_{ij}.
This convention is already used in Prop. 15 and should be observed when populating F(α,β).

Concrete examples and unit checks to run (tiny, decisive)
- Maintain the unit tests for IsO5: (+,+,+,+,+) ∉ O5; (+,−,−,−,−) ∈ O5; (+,−,+,−,+) ∉ O5.
- The four decisive test vectors from notes.md §P1–P3:
  • (+,+,−,−,+), (+,+,+,−,−), (+,−,−,−,+), (+,−,+,−,−). Each should be classified non‑O5 for the 2+2 ansatz to witness those profiles.
- Populate F(+,+) and F(+,-) fully (8 triples each). Immediate checks: (+++)∈F(+,+); (−,−,−)∉F(+,-). Report sizes |F(+,+)|, |F(+,-)| and list the complements {±1}^3\F.
- If both complements have size ≤1, conclude |A|=4 by Lemma UB. If, stronger, F(α,β) equals “product +1,” conclude AP by the structured ansatz (Conjecture P+).

Why these steps are valuable incremental progress
- Lemma UB is unconditional and reduces the |A|=4 decision to checking two tiny local tables (16 values total) and two cardinality inequalities; this is significantly weaker than the earlier need to solve all 6‑variable instances, yet it suffices to conclude AP if the tables are as sparse as anticipated.
- Conjecture P+ crystallizes the suspected structure of the local constraints and provides a one‑line uniform solution template if verified; even if false, the explicit counter‑entries will directly inform a minimal backtracking strategy.

Obstacles and open points
- We still lack an analytic classification of the O5 orbit to certify F(α,β) without computation. Given the minute size (32 total 5‑vectors), a brute‑force enumeration remains the quickest rigorous path.
- The conditional Prop. 11 remains unverified pending the membership of the three permutations of (+,−,−) in each F(α,β). This should be settled by the same F‑table computation.

Gaps, corrections, and notes on output.md
- Prop. 3 uses a coordinate‑free description of Y_k; when F‑tables are integrated into output.md, it would be helpful to restate the fixed 5‑coordinate ordering (as above) near Prop. 3 or before Prop. 11 (currently the precise ordering is spelled out later in Prop. 15).
- All other statements in output.md remain correct; no further errors spotted. Lemma 13 is properly justified (it uses the canonical O5 representative under the fixed coordinate order).

Next steps for the verifier (minimal and decisive)
1) Implement IsO5 via Lemma 6; run the three unit tests and report the O5 orbit size.
2) Evaluate IsO5 on the four concrete 5‑vectors listed above to settle P1–P3 for the 2+2 ansatz.
3) Compute F(+,+) and F(+,-) completely; derive the other two by Cor. 9. Report complements and sizes.
4) If |{±1}^3\F(+,+)| ≤ 1 and |{±1}^3\F(+,-)| ≤ 1, invoke Lemma UB to conclude the |A|=4 step and AP.
5) If, stronger, F(α,β)={triples with product +1} in both cases, record the uniform construction x_{ij}=w_iw_j as a final proof strategy for all |A|.
6) If either complement has size ≥2, run the 2^6 brute‑force CSP per realized (B,C) profiles or at least per the 16 type‑patterns over k∈A (keeping the ordered pairs {++,−−,+−,−+}); archive either SAT witnesses or a single UNSAT certificate (refuting AP).

End of round summary
- Introduced a new unconditional lemma (union‑bound feasibility) that can, by checking two 8‑entry tables, settle |A|=4 and hence AP.
- Formulated the “product +1” conjecture (precisely testable) which, if true, yields a uniform, simple construction for the amalgam.
- Provided precise, small computational tasks that will decisively resolve the remaining |A|=4 bottleneck, along with explicit test vectors and sanity checks.

## Round 0006 — 2025-08-27T19:00:01.879047Z

Status and focus
- We keep the one‑point reduction and the 6‑variable CSP for |A|=4 (output.md Prop. 3). The key missing piece remains deciding the local 5‑set constraints, i.e., membership in F(α,β)⊆{±1}^3 (output.md Cor. 9 gives the sign‑flip symmetry, but we still need explicit tables or at least a few decisive entries).
- Proposition 11 is conditional; Proposition 12 settles the equal‑constant subcase; Proposition 14 settles |A|=3; Proposition 15 provides a further solvable subclass. No contradictions detected in output.md.

New micro‑lemmas and structural observations (auditable)
1) Type patterns on A induced by 5‑types (enumeration aid).
- Lemma T. Let B be a 5‑vertex structure on A∪{b} with type T_B∈{C5,H5}. Then the 4‑tuple (p^B_k)_{k∈A} equals:
  • Constant (all + or all −) if T_B=C5.
  • A 2+2 pattern (exactly two + and two −) if T_B=H5.
  Proof. For the 5‑vector p on A∪{b}, p_x is constant on C5; restricting to coordinates indexed by A yields a constant 4‑tuple. For H5, the canonical representative (+,−,+,−,+), after removing the “missing b” coordinate, leaves exactly two + and two − on A; S4 relabelings of A preserve the 2+2 property.∎
- Why useful: Narrows the |A|=4 case analysis to macro‑profiles (C,C), (C,H), (H,C), (H,H), and within each, the eq/opp pattern over k is now strongly constrained (e.g., C vs H yields exactly two equals and two opposites).

2) Triangle triple distribution under vertex‑sign assignments (combinatorial control).
- Lemma D. Let w∈{±1}^A and set x_{ij}=w_i w_j. For the four triangles (Y_k), the triple on Y_k is:
  • If |{i:w_i=+1}|=4 or 0: all four triples are (+++).
  • If |{i:w_i=+1}|=3 or 1: exactly one Y_k has (+++); the other three have permutations of (+,−,−).
  • If |{i:w_i=+1}|=2: all four Y_k have permutations of (+,−,−).
  Proof. For a 3‑vertex set, the pairwise products are (+++) if all three w are equal; otherwise exactly one edge‑product is + and two are −. Counting how many triangles contain three equal signs yields the cases above.∎
- Why useful: This extends Lemma 10 (the 2+2 case) and gives us three controllable regimes (0/1/4 occurrences of (+++)) by choosing w with 2+/2−, 3+/1− (or 1+/3−), or 4+/0− (or 0+/4−).

3) Global parity constraint across the four triangles (sanity check for UNSAT certificates).
- Lemma P (parity). For any assignment x_{ij}∈{±1}, the product of the four triangle‑products equals +1. Equivalently, the number of triangles whose triple has product −1 is even.
  Proof. Each edge variable x_{ij} appears in exactly two triangles of K_4, hence ∏_k (x_{ab}x_{ac}x_{bc} on triangle k) = ∏_{edges} x_{ij}^2 = 1.∎
- Why useful: If future F‑tables force odd parity (e.g., three triangles requiring triple product −1 and one requiring +1), we get an immediate contradiction, giving a clean UNSAT witness.

4) Minimal decisive membership checks for the 2+2/3+1 strategy (refinement of Prop. 11).
- Observation: The vertex‑sign method only ever produces (+++) or permutations of (+,−,−). Thus, to certify existence of an amalgam, it suffices to know, per (α,β): whether (+++) is allowed and whether the specific permutations of (+,−,−) that occur under a chosen w are allowed.
- Conditional Proposition 11′ (weaker prerequisites than Prop. 11). Fix the coordinate order from notes/output. If the following hold:
  (E1) (+++)∈F(+,+) and (+++)∈F(−,−) (true: ±C5),
  (E2) For (α,β)∈{(+,+),(−,−)}, at least one of the two concrete permutations of (+,−,−) realized by a 2+2 choice w=(+,+,−,−) (e.g., (+,−,−) and (−,−,+) as in P1) lies in F(α,β),
  (E3) For (α,β)∈{(+,-),(−,+)}, at least one of the two concrete permutations of (+,−,−) realized by a 2+2 choice w lies in F(α,β),
  (E4) For (α,β)∈{(+,-)}, (+++)∈F(+,-) or else (E3) holds and the count of k with (α_k,β_k)=(+,-) is even (so w with 2+2 can serve). For (−,+), (+++) is known forbidden (output.md Lemma 13), so require (E3) for those k.
  then every one‑point instance over |A|=4 is solvable by choosing w with 2+2, 3+1, or 4+0 as appropriate (use Lemma D to match how many (+++) triples are needed).
- Why useful: This further reduces the needed F‑table data to a handful of entries tied to the two triple shapes the vertex‑sign method can realize, and it incorporates the parity Lemma P to handle counts.

Concrete test vectors (to be evaluated by IsO5)
- As already prepared in notes/output, validating the following suffices to green‑light the 2+2 ansatz on central profiles:
  • P1 (C vs C, aligned): (+,+,−,−,+), (+,+,+,−,−).
  • P2 (C vs C, opposed): (+,−,−,−,+), (+,−,+,−,−).
  • P3 (C vs H, mixed): same two vectors as P2.
- Action: A single IsO5 pass on these four 5‑vectors decides P1–P3. If all are non‑O5, we have explicit amalgams for these macro‑profiles.

Enumeration of macro‑profiles and expected eq/opp distribution (for small exhaustive runs)
- By Lemma T, the four p^B_k (k∈A) are: all equal (C) or 2+2 (H). Hence, up to S4 on A, the possibilities are:
  • (C,C): either all eq (δ,δ) or all opp (δ,−δ).
  • (C,H) or (H,C): exactly two eq and two opp (which of the two depends on δ and the 2+2 positions).
  • (H,H): 4 eq (when identical), 0 eq (when negations), or 2 eq.
- These five eq/opp profiles, coupled with which positions within the 2+2 pattern, represent all realizable one‑point patterns.
- Why useful: This confines the 2^6 brute‑force search to a tiny, structured set of cases for final certification if needed.

Gaps/clarifications in output.md
- Prop. 11 requires “all three permutations” of (+,−,−) in each F(α,β). For our vertex‑sign method, only two concrete permutations occur for a fixed 2+2 choice; moreover, we can swap which two appear by permuting which vertices receive w=+ (Lemma D/notes’ P1–P3). It would be slightly sharper to state a conditional that only requires those two realized permutations (as in Proposition 11′ above) rather than all three.
- The precise mapping from the triple (x_{jℓ},x_{iℓ},x_{ij}) to the last three coordinates of p(Y_k) is stated in notes.md but not explicitly in output.md’s Prop. 3. When F‑tables are finalized, restating the “missing i/j/ℓ” order there would aid reproducibility.

Obstacles
- An analytic characterization of F(+,+) and F(+,-) remains elusive. We therefore continue to rely on the minimal computation plan (IsO5 oracle + 16 evaluations) to settle them.
- We cannot presently certify or refute the status of (+++) in F(+,-) without computation (we correctly retracted a heuristic argument earlier; output.md Lemma 13 addresses only (---)∉F(+,-)).

Next steps for the verifier (small, decisive)
1) Run IsO5 on the four vectors listed under P1–P3.
2) Compute F(+,+), F(+,-) fully (8 triples each) under the fixed coordinate convention; derive F(−,−), F(−,+) by sign‑flip (Cor. 9). Archive tables.
3) If both (+,−,−) and (−,−,+) lie in each F(α,β), apply output.md Prop. 11 directly. Otherwise, apply Proposition 11′ + Lemma D + parity Lemma P to choose between 2+2 vs 3+1 vs 4+0 for each macro‑profile, using (+++) where allowed to match the required counts among k.
4) If any macro‑profile remains unresolved, brute‑force its 2^6 assignments (Prop. 3), report SAT/UNSAT, and archive witnesses/certificates.

Why this is progress
- We refined the uniform vertex‑sign construction beyond the 2+2 case (Lemma D), and distilled the necessary F‑table checks to a minimal, actionable set (Proposition 11′), incorporating a global parity invariant (Lemma P).
- We classified the realizable p^B, p^C patterns over A (Lemma T), narrowing the remaining search to five macro‑profiles and providing a clear plan to dispatch each.
- These steps are immediately testable by the IsO5 routine and require only a handful of evaluations to either conclude AP or extract a concrete counterexample.

## Round 0006 — 2025-08-27T19:42:10.463400Z

Status and aim
- We continue to resolve the one-point amalgamation for |A|=4, which reduces AP for H to a finite CSP on six edge variables with four local 5-set constraints (output.md Prop. 3). The computational oracle IsO5 is still the bottleneck; I add rigorously checkable lemmas that simplify the local constraint analysis and shrink the number of patterns to verify.

New lemma: explicit O5-image formula (useful for hand checks)
- Lemma (O5 image equals “−ε off one coordinate”). Let e_O = (+,−,−,−,−). For any τ∈S_5 with ε(τ)=(ε_1,…,ε_5) and any i_0 with τ^{-1}(i_0)=the + position of e_O, the image p′ under the signed action satisfies
  p′_i = −ε_i for i≠i_0, and p′_{i_0} = ε_{i_0}.
  Proof. Immediate from p′_i = ε_i·(e_O)_{τ^{-1}(i)} and that (e_O)_j is + at one j and − otherwise.
- Why useful: To test whether a target 5-vector p lies in the O5 orbit, it suffices to check if there exists some i_0 with ε determined by ε_{i_0}=p_{i_0} and ε_i=−p_i for i≠i_0 such that ε=ε(τ) for some τ. This is a sharper necessary-and-sufficient condition and provides quick hand-proofs in some cases.

Corollary: all-equal triple is forbidden in the opposite-fixed case (now with a clean proof)
- Corollary (completes the “hard exclusion” in both directions). For (α,β)=(+,-), both (+++) and (---) are forbidden: (x,y,z)∉F(+,-) for (x,y,z)=(+,+,+) and (x,y,z)=(−,−,−). Proof:
  • (---) gives p=(+,-,−,−,−), the canonical O5 representative.
  • (+++) gives p=(+,-,+,+,+). By Lemma 8 there exists τ with ε_i(τ)=−1 for all i. Taking i_0=2 yields p′ with p′_2=ε_2=−1 and p′_i=−ε_i=+1 for i≠2, i.e., p′=(+,-,+,+,+). Hence p is in O5.∎
- Symmetrically, for (α,β)=(−,+), both (+++) and (---) are forbidden by global sign reversal (output.md Cor. 9).
- Why useful: This fully classifies the all-equal triples for the opposite-fixed case without computation, tightening the F(+,-) and F(−,+) tables and providing robust unit tests for IsO5.

Hand-verified ε-examples (sanity catalog for the verifier)
- Using Lemma 6, I computed ε(τ) for small τ (useful to debug IsO5):
  • id: ε=(+,+,+,+,+), Σε=+5.
  • (12): ε=(+,+,−,−,−), Σε=−1.
  • (123): ε=(+,−,−,+,+), Σε=+1.
  • (12)(34): ε=(−,−,−,−,+), Σε=−3.
  • (13): ε=(−,−,−,−,−), Σε=−5 (the “central” flip from Lemma 8).
  These confirm that Σε can realize ±5, ±3, ±1, so constraints based solely on Σε (or plus-counts) cannot rule out O5 membership.

Example checks guided by the O5-image formula
- For p=(+,-,+,-,-): considering i_0=2 gives ε=(−,−,−,+,+); i_0=1 gives ε=(+,+,−,+,+). Both patterns appear plausible from small τ, but I do not assert membership either way; this illustrates how the formula reduces a membership query to “does this ε occur as ε(τ)?”, which is trivial to decide computationally and infeasible by hand enumeration.

New solvable family via 2+2 vertex-sign ansatz (synthesis and scope)
- Recall Lemma 10 and Prop. 11. Under x_{ij}=w_iw_j with exactly two + and two − on A, each triangle-triple is a permutation of (+,−,−). Thus, if the verifier confirms that every F(α,β) contains all three permutations of (+,−,−), then the one-point step over |A|=4 is uniformly solvable (Prop. 11), implying AP for H (Lemma 2).
- I emphasize that the only remaining local memberships to check for this route are the 12 entries: for each (α,β)∈{++, +−, −+, −−}, the three permutations of (+,−,−). Cor. 9 halves this (the two opposite-sign cases follow by triplewise negation), so only F(+,+) and F(+,-) need computing.

Refined classification of 4-bit type patterns on A (search-space reduction)
- Observation (C5): For any B of type C5 on A∪{b}, the 5-vector on that 5-set is constant ±, hence the 4-bit pattern (p^B_k)_{k∈A} is constant (all equal) as well. This confirms that, in the one-point data, any non-constant 4-bit pattern on A must come from an H5 side.
- Heuristic (H5, to be verified computationally): For any C of type H5 on A∪{c}, the 4-bit pattern (p^C_k)_{k∈A} consists of exactly two + and two − (never all equal). The canonical representative (+,−,+,−) exhibits this; testing whether all six 2–2 patterns occur will reduce the |A|=4 enumeration by symmetry. Action item: Enumerate the orbit of H5 under relabelings that fix c and record the distinct 4-bit patterns on A; this bounds the profile list to check.

Obstacles and why a small computation remains necessary
- Attempts to certify (+,−,−)-admissibility analytically in F(+,+) or F(+,-) via parity/sum invariants fail because the S_5 signed action realizes ε with all odd sums, and the O5 orbit is large. The O5-image formula reduces membership to ε-realizability, yet characterizing the full image E={ε(τ):τ∈S_5} pen-and-paper appears cumbersome. A 120-step enumeration is the right tool here.

Actionable next steps for the verifier (precise and minimal)
1) Implement IsO5 via output.md Lemma 6. Unit tests: (+,+,+,+,+) non‑O5; (+,−,−,−,−) O5; (+,−,+,−,+) non‑O5; and the five ε-vectors above should appear for the listed τ.
2) Populate F(+,+) and F(+,-) (8 triples each) under the fixed coordinate order (notes/output). Obtain F(−,−), F(−,+) by triplewise negation (Cor. 9). Confirm the proven exclusions: for (+,-), exclude (+++) and (---).
3) Check the 12 key memberships: for each (α,β), all permutations of (+,−,−) belong to F(α,β). If yes, conclude the |A|=4 one‑point step via Prop. 11 and hence AP (Lemma 2).
4) If any of those memberships fail, revert to the 2^6 brute‑force CSP per realized (B,C) profile (with the H5 4-bit patterns catalogued as above). Either archive SAT assignments or produce an UNSAT certificate.

Gaps and clarifications in output.md
- Prop. 11 remains conditional on the F-table check; it should eventually cite explicitly which 12 memberships were verified. The present round supplies a complete proof that (+++) and (---) are both forbidden in F(+,-), filling a previously flagged gap.
- The precise ordering of the last three coordinates in p(Y_k) is critical and already stated; when the F-tables are recorded, repeat this convention in output.md adjacent to their definition for reproducibility.

Summary of this round’s contributions
- Introduced and proved the O5-image formula p = −ε off one coordinate, enabling quick hand checks and guiding IsO5 implementation.
- Fully classified “all-equal” triples in the opposite-fixed case as O5 (forbidden) by a short, rigorous argument.
- Provided computed ε-vectors for several small τ as sanity data.
- Outlined a minimal verification plan: compute two F-tables, test 12 memberships to unlock the uniform 2+2 solution; otherwise, fall back to the tiny 2^6 CSP with a reduced profile list via H5’s 4-bit patterns on A.

## Round 0007 — 2025-08-27T19:51:54.349723Z

Round 0007 — Focus: tightening IsO5 and the local F-tables; cocycle and generator analysis; implementable criteria

Status recap
- The reduction to one-point amalgamation and the |A|=4 CSP is sound (output.md Props. 1–3). The small cases |A|≤2 and |A|=3 are closed (Cor. 4, Prop. 14). We have two key tools now recorded: central symmetry (Lemma 8) and the global parity invariant across the four triangles (Lemma 17). The union-bound feasibility criterion (Lemma 16) gives a decisive small-table condition.
- The remaining bottleneck is to populate F(+,+) and F(+,-) (and derive the other two by Cor. 9), and then either apply Lemma 16 or the 2+2 construction (Prop. 11) to finish |A|=4.

New micro-lemmas (auditable) — structure of ε(τ) and a cocycle
1) Lemma 18 (ε-cocycle for composition).
- Statement: For τ,σ∈S5 and i∈{1,…,5}, one has ε_i(τσ) = ε_i(τ)·ε_{τ^{-1}(i)}(σ).
- Proof: For p′ = A_τ(p) with (A_τp)_i = ε_i(τ)·p_{τ^{-1}(i)}, we have (A_τA_σ p)_i = ε_i(τ)·(A_σ p)_{τ^{-1}(i)} = ε_i(τ)·ε_{τ^{-1}(i)}(σ)·p_{σ^{-1}(τ^{-1}(i))}. Since A_{τσ}p has i-th coordinate ε_i(τσ)·p_{(τσ)^{-1}(i)}, uniqueness of the action implies ε_i(τσ) = ε_i(τ)·ε_{τ^{-1}(i)}(σ). ∎
- Why useful: Enables computation of all ε(τ) from the generators without recomputing c-counts; critical for a robust, fast IsO5 oracle.

2) Lemma 19 (ε for adjacent transpositions).
- Statement: For s_k=(k k+1) (k=1,2,3,4), ε(s_k) has + at positions k,k+1 and − elsewhere, i.e., ε(s_k)=(−,…,−, + at k, + at k+1, −,…,−).
- Proof: s_k has exactly one inversion (between k and k+1). Its restriction to [5]\{j} has odd sign iff j∈{k,k+1}, hence ε_i(s_k)=sgn(s_k)·(−1)^{c_j} equals + at i=k,k+1 and − otherwise. This matches direct c_j counts (as checked in notes earlier). ∎
- Why useful: Supplies base ε-vectors on generators; combined with Lemma 18 yields all ε(τ) by multiplying generators.

3) Corollary (parity of the number of + in ε(τ)).
- By Corollary 7, ∏_i ε_i(τ)=sgn(τ). Let m(ε) be the number of + entries. Then (−1)^{5−m(ε)}=sgn(τ), so m(ε) is odd if τ is even and even if τ is odd. Useful as a sanity check for ε enumeration.

Corrected and implementable IsO5 criterion (pair-set S)
- O5-image formula (from notes) says: for e_O=(+,-,-,-,-), the image under τ is p with p_i = −ε_i(τ) for i≠i0 and p_{i0} = ε_{i0}(τ) where i0:=τ(1). Equivalently, for a given p, there exists τ with (ε,i0)=(ε(τ),τ(1)) such that p⊙ε equals h(i0), the vector with exactly one + at i0 and − elsewhere.
- Crucial correction: It is not enough to find i0 with p⊙h(i0) ∈ E={ε(τ)}; the pair (ε,i0) must be realized by the same τ (i.e., i0=τ(1) for ε=ε(τ)). This invalidates the naive “ε-only” test and explains the earlier false positive for p=(+,+,+,+,+) with ε=h(5).
- Implementation blueprint: Precompute the pair-set S = { (ε(τ), i0=τ(1)) : τ∈S5 } using Lemma 18 and generators s_k (Lemma 19), tracking i0 under right-multiplication: if τ′=τ s_k then ε(τ′)_i = ε_i(τ)·ε_{τ^{-1}(i)}(s_k) and i0′=τ(s_k(1)). Then IsO5(p) is true iff ∃(ε,i0)∈S with p_i=−ε_i for i≠i0 and p_{i0}=ε_{i0}. This avoids orbit-building and uses only a 120-pair membership test per query.

Hand checks and unit data (partial, to aid verification)
- ε on generators (confirmed):
  • ε((12))=(+,+,−,−,−),
  • ε((23))=(−,+,+,−,−),
  • ε((34))=(−,−,+,+,−),
  • ε((45))=(−,−,−,+,+).
- Quick “non-O5 by partial exclusion” for two of the profile vectors using these ε-samples:
  • p1=(+,+,−,−,+): For the above ε and also ε(id) and ε((13))=(−,−,−,−,−), the match count |{i: p1_i=ε_i}| is 4,2,0,2,3 respectively (never 1). This is not a proof of non-O5 (other τ could still work), but serves as a debugging checklist for IsO5. Please use the S-based oracle to decide decisively.
  • p2=(+,+,+,−,−) similarly has match-counts 3,2,2,0,1 under the above ε; again ambiguous and needs a full S-check.

Consequences for F(α,β) computation
- With the S-oracle in place, F(+,+) and F(+,-) are obtained by the 8 tests on p=(α,β,x,y,z). By Cor. 9, F(−,−) and F(−,+) follow by triplewise negation. Unit constraints to verify:
  • (+++)∈F(+,+) and (−,−,−)∈F(−,−) (constant 5-vectors are ±C5, non-O5).
  • (−,−,−)∉F(+,-) (output.md Lemma 13); by symmetry (+++)∉F(−,+).
- Two decisive targets (carry-over from last round): check whether (+−−)∈F(+,+) and (+−−)∈F(+,-). If both hold (for all three permutations under our fixed coordinate order), Prop. 11 resolves |A|=4 uniformly via the 2+2 ansatz.

Implementation blueprint (refined, minimal)
1) Build S via the cocycle:
  - Start with τ=id: ε=+++++, i0=1.
  - BFS over right-multiplication by s_k (k=1..4) using Lemma 18 to update ε and i0.
  - Store S as a set of 120 pairs (ε,i0). Sanity checks: parity of plus-count in ε matches sgn(τ); S has size 120; sample ε above are present with their correct i0.
2) Implement IsO5(p): return true iff ∃(ε,i0)∈S with p_i=−ε_i for i≠i0 and p_{i0}=ε_{i0}. Unit tests: (+,−,−,−,−) true; (+,+,+,+,+) false; (+,−,+,−,+) false.
3) Compute F(+,+) and F(+,-) (8 entries each) under the fixed coordinate convention (notes/output). Derive the other two via Cor. 9. Report complements and sizes. If both complements have size ≤1, conclude |A|=4 by Lemma 16.
4) If, stronger, all three permutations of (+,−,−) lie in both F(+,+) and F(+,-), apply Prop. 11 to conclude |A|=4 by the 2+2 ansatz x_{ij}=w_i w_j.
5) If either condition fails, brute-force the 2^6 CSP on the realized (B,C) profiles; use Lemma 17 to prune.

Gaps and clarifications in output.md (to address later; do not modify now)
- It would be helpful to add Lemma 18 (ε-cocycle) in output.md as an implementation lemma; currently Lemma 6 suffices but the cocycle substantially simplifies and stabilizes code.
- The O5-image formula specialized to e_O and the necessity to track the pair (ε(τ), i0=τ(1)) is only in notes; incorporating it in output.md would prevent misuse of “ε-only” tests. We flagged the earlier incorrect simplification explicitly here.
- Coordinate ordering for the last three entries of p(Y_k) is correctly fixed near Prop. 15; when F-tables appear, restating that ordering there will improve reproducibility.

Obstacles
- A purely analytic classification of E={ε(τ)} (or of the O5 orbit) appears cumbersome; the cocycle+generator method is the right small computation.
- Without the F-tables, we cannot certify the 2+2 ansatz or the union-bound criterion. These remain the decisive next computations.

Next steps (concrete, minimal)
- Verifier: Implement S via Lemma 18 and ε(s_k) from Lemma 19; build IsO5 as above and run the standard unit tests.
- Populate F(+,+), F(+,-); confirm the already-proved exclusions and record sizes of complements. If both complements ≤1, invoke Lemma 16 to conclude |A|=4 and AP. If, stronger, (+−−)-permutations are allowed in both, apply Prop. 11 to conclude AP via the 2+2 construction.
- Independently, evaluate IsO5 on the four concrete 5-vectors from profiles P1–P3 listed in notes/output; archive their classifications and, if non-O5, keep these as explicit witnesses for representative one-point instances.

Why this is incremental, auditable progress
- We introduced two precise, easy-to-check lemmas (ε-cocycle and ε on generators) that drastically simplify the O5 oracle and remove ambiguity in the ε-factors.
- We corrected a subtle but important pitfall (the necessity of tracking i0 alongside ε in O5 membership), providing a rigorous criterion based on the pair-set S.
- We supplied partial hand checks and a concrete, minimal computation plan that will decisively settle the small F-tables and hence the |A|=4 step via Lemma 16 or Prop. 11.

## Round 0007 — 2025-08-27T19:52:04.491555Z

Round 0007 — Focus: sharpen O5-membership testing and prune local tables with rigorous tools; refine the |A|=4 search

Summary of what is rigorous in output.md and remaining gaps
- Proposition 1, Lemma 2, Proposition 3, Corollary 4, Fact 5, Lemma 6, Corollary 7, Lemma 8, Corollary 9, Lemma 10, Proposition 11 (conditional), Proposition 12, Lemma 13, Proposition 14, Proposition 15, Lemma 16, Corollary 16.1, Lemma 17 are internally consistent and correctly stated.
- Remaining gap to settle AP: We still need the two base local tables F(+,+), F(+,-) and, consequently, a resolution of the |A|=4 one‑point CSP across the realized profiles. Proposition 11 remains conditional; Corollary 16.1 offers an unconditional route if both complements are ≤1, but this awaits the tiny computation.
- A useful characterization of O5 membership (the “Hamming‑1” criterion; see Lemma H1 below) is not yet recorded in output.md. It reduces orbit membership to a radius‑1 Hamming neighborhood test around the set E={ε(τ):τ∈S5}. This should be added later for transparency (do not edit output.md now).

New micro‑lemma (rigorous) — Hamming‑1 characterization of the O5 orbit (implementation aid)
Lemma H1 (O5 as Hamming distance 1 from E).
- Let e_O=(+,-,-,-,-) and E:={ε(τ):τ∈S_5} with ε(τ) as in Lemma 6. Then for p∈{±1}^5,
  p∈O5 if and only if there exist ε∈E and i0∈{1,…,5} such that, writing q:=-p, one has Hamming(q,ε)=1 with the unique discrepancy at i0.
- Equivalently, O5 = { flip_all_but_one(ε,i0) : ε∈E, i0∈[5] }, where flip_all_but_one(ε,i0) is the 5‑vector v with v_{i0}=ε_{i0} and v_i=−ε_i for i≠i0.
Proof. By the specialization of the action to e_O: R_τ(e_O) has coordinates p′_i = ε_i(τ)·(e_O)_{τ^{-1}(i)}; if j=τ^{-1}(i) equals the unique + position of e_O, then p′_i=ε_i(τ), and otherwise p′_i=−ε_i(τ). Writing i0:=τ(1), we obtain exactly p′=flip_all_but_one(ε(τ),i0). Conversely, any vector of this form is R_τ(e_O) for the corresponding τ. Rewriting as q:=-p yields the Hamming‑1 characterization. ∎
Why useful. For an IsO5 oracle, it suffices to precompute E (120 evaluations via Lemma 6) and then test membership of −p in the radius‑1 Hamming neighborhood of E. This is faster and more robust than building the full O5 orbit, and supports hand checks.

Concrete consequences and hand checks (auditable)
- Sanity: For p=(+,-,+,+,+), q=(−,+,−,−,−). If ε=all − were known to occur with i0=2, then Hamming(q,ε)=1 at 2 and p∈O5. We cannot assert “ε=all − with τ(1)=2” without computation (see Obstacles), so we keep this as a tiny check for the IsO5 implementation, not as a claim.
- Verified exclusions retained: (x,y,z)=(−,−,−) is forbidden for (α,β)=(+,-) (Lemma 13). By sign symmetry (Cor. 9), (+++) is forbidden for (α,β)=(−,+).
- Verified inclusions (from |A|=3 constructive witnesses, Proposition 14): (+++)∈F(+,+); (−−−)∈F(−,−); (+,−,+)∈F(+,-); (−,+,−)∈F(−,+). These serve as base unit tests for the F‑table computation.

Refined computational blueprint (minimal, decisive)
A) Precompute E and implement IsO5 via Lemma H1.
- Enumerate all τ∈S5; compute ε(τ) via Lemma 6; store E as a set of 5‑vectors.
- IsO5(p): compute q=−p; return true iff ∃ε∈E with Hamming(q,ε)=1. Archive |E| and, optionally, the multiset of sums Σε_i (useful for diagnostics).
- Unit checks: classify (+,+,+,+,+) as non‑O5; (+,−,−,−,−) as O5; (+,−,+,−,+) as non‑O5. Also verify sample ε(τ) vectors from notes (id, (12), (123), (12)(34), (13)).

B) Populate the base local tables under the fixed coordinate order.
- Compute F(+,+) and F(+,-) completely by evaluating the 8 triples each against IsO5 on p=(α,β,x,y,z). Derive F(−,−) and F(−,+) by triplewise negation (Cor. 9). Archive explicit lists and complements; report sizes.
- Immediate validations: (+++)∈F(+,+), (−−−)∉F(+,-) as above. Keep an eye on the number of forbidden triples per table (Cor. 16.1 route).

C) Decide |A|=4 one‑point amalgamation via two small routes.
- If |{±1}^3\F(+,+)| ≤ 1 and |{±1}^3\F(+,-)| ≤ 1, invoke Lemma 16 + Cor. 16.1 to conclude the |A|=4 step and hence AP (Lemma 2).
- Otherwise, run the 6‑variable CSP per realized profile (brute force over x_{ij}∈{±1}): for each assignment, build the four p(Y_k) and test IsO5; archive a SAT witness or an UNSAT certificate if found. Use Lemma 17 (parity) to prune: an odd number of triangles demanding triple product −1 is impossible.

D) Optional but efficient: a backtracking solver with small branching.
- Choose a triangle (say Y_4) and fix its triple (x_{12},x_{13},x_{23}) to one of the |F(p^B_4,p^C_4)| allowed patterns (at most 8 choices). Propagate to constraints on Y_1,Y_2,Y_3 via shared edges; backtrack when hitting an O5. With at most 8 initial branches and shallow propagation, this is typically faster than the naive 2^6 loop.

Implications for the 2+2 vertex‑sign ansatz
- The conditional Proposition 11 cannot be used until we certify memberships of all three permutations of (+,−,−) in each F(α,β). The Hamming‑1 criterion (Lemma H1) provides a crisp way to test the key instances; in particular, the four 5‑vectors listed in notes for P1–P3 should be tested immediately (they are built from permutations of (+,−,−) on the last three coordinates with (α,β)=(+,+) and (+,−)).
- If any of those four classifies as O5, the uniform 2+2 ansatz fails for that profile (which is fine; Proposition 12 already solves the fully aligned (++++) case by a constant assignment). We then proceed with the general CSP or the backtracking solver.

Examples to feed IsO5 (relisted for convenience; same coordinate order as output.md)
- P1 (C vs C, aligned): check (+,+,−,−,+) and (+,+,+,−,−).
- P2 (C vs C, opposed): check (+,−,−,−,+) and (+,−,+,−,−).
- P3 (C vs H, mixed): check (+,−,−,−,+) and (+,−,+,−,−) (same as P2).
Outcome of these four evaluations will immediately confirm or refute the 2+2 ansatz on these central profiles and guide the subsequent global search.

Why these steps are concrete, incremental progress
- Lemma H1 gives a simple, exact O5‑membership test in terms of a precomputed set E and Hamming distance. It streamlines the IsO5 routine and enables hand checks in small instances.
- The plan B/C/D consolidates earlier ideas into a minimal, decisive pipeline that either resolves |A|=4 via the small‑table criterion (Cor. 16.1) or via a tiny brute force/backtracking with parity pruning. This is auditable and easily implementable.
- The explicit test vectors from P1–P3 remain the quickest sanity checks; their classification directly informs whether the 2+2 ansatz is viable anywhere beyond the equal‑constant subcase.

Obstacles and open items
- We still lack an analytic description of E and, as a result, of the O5 orbit; computing E (120 entries) is the appropriate step.
- Without the F‑tables, we cannot confirm or deny the “product +1” conjecture (Conjecture P+) or the stronger condition in Proposition 11.
- Attempts to hand‑prove (+++)∉F(+,-) or to classify (+,−,−) in F(+,+) stumbled on the constraint i0=τ(1) in the O5‑image formula; these are best left to the IsO5 oracle.

Notes on output.md (gaps/clarifications; do not edit now)
- It would be helpful to add, after Lemma 6 or near the definition of O5, the Hamming‑1 characterization (Lemma H1) as a corollary specialized to the O5 seed e_O. This is already established in notes and will aid future readers.
- The coordinate convention for p(Y_k) is clearly stated near Proposition 15; when the F‑tables are finalized, repeating that convention next to their definition will avoid confusion in reproducing the data.

Next steps for the verifier (minimal, checkable)
1) Build E via Lemma 6 and implement IsO5 using Lemma H1; run the unit tests and report |E|.
2) Evaluate the four P1–P3 vectors; report their O5 status.
3) Populate F(+,+) and F(+,-); derive the others via Cor. 9; report complements and confirm Proposition 14’s witness triples.
4) If both complements are ≤1, conclude |A|=4 via Lemma 16 and AP via Lemma 2. Else, run the 6‑variable CSP (or the backtracking variant) on realized profiles; archive SAT witnesses or an UNSAT certificate if found.

This round’s deliverables
- New Lemma H1 (O5=Hamming‑1 from E), with proof and implementation guidance.
- A clarified, minimal computational plan prioritizing E and the two base F‑tables, and a compact backtracking alternative to the 2^6 brute force.
- Retained and emphasized concrete test vectors (P1–P3) and parity‑based pruning for the |A|=4 search.

## Round 0007 — 2025-08-27T19:52:27.721171Z

# Round 0007 — Inner‑product characterization of O5 and immediate consequences for local F‑tables

## Quick recap and current bottleneck
- Goal: Decide AP for H (finite 4‑hypertournaments omitting O5) via the one‑point step. The hard minimal base is |A|=4, a 6‑variable CSP with four local 5‑set constraints Y_k (output.md Prop. 3).
- Missing data: The local tables F(α,β)⊆{±1}^3 (especially for (α,β)∈{(+,+),(+,-)}), which determine whether the 2+2 vertex‑sign ansatz or a small brute‑force search suffices. We previously left open whether (+++)∈F(+,-).

## New lemma (rigorous, implementation‑ready)
Lemma 18 (Inner‑product characterization of O5).
- Statement. Let E={ε(τ):τ∈S5} be the ε‑set from Lemma 6. For p∈{±1}^5, one has p∈O5 if and only if there exists ε∈E with Σ_{i=1}^5 p_i ε_i = −3.
- Proof. O5 is the orbit of e_O=(+,-,-,-,-). For τ∈S5, the image has the form p=φ(ε,i0) where ε=ε(τ), i0=τ(1), and p_i=ε_i if i=i0 and p_i=−ε_i otherwise (notes: “O5‑image formula”). Hence Σ p_i ε_i = ε_{i0}^2 + Σ_{i≠i0}(−ε_i^2)=1−4=−3. Conversely, if Σ p_i ε_i = −3 with ε∈E, then exactly one coordinate satisfies p_i ε_i=+1 (the others are −1). Let i0 be this index. Then p=φ(ε,i0), hence p∈O5. ∎
- Why useful: Reduces IsO5 to a 120‑element check over E with a single scalar test; in particular, special ε∈E yield immediate hand‑classifications for families of 5‑vectors p.

## Immediate corollaries for F(α,β) (hard exclusions now settled)
Using Lemma 8 (ε≡−1∈E) and that ε≡(+1)∈E (τ=id), Lemma 18 yields:
- C1. F(+,-): (+++) is forbidden. Indeed, p=(+,-,+,+,+) has Σ p_i=+3, and with ε≡−1 we get Σ p_i ε_i=−3 ⇒ O5. Together with output.md Lemma 13 ((---) forbidden), we now fully classify the all‑equal triples in the opposite‑fixed case: both (+++) and (---) are O5 (forbidden).
- C2. F(+,+): Every triple with exactly two “+” and one “−” is forbidden. For p=(+,+,x,y,z), Σ p_i = 2 + (x+y+z). When the triple has two + and one −, x+y+z=+1 ⇒ Σ p_i=+3, hence O5 by ε≡−1. Thus all three permutations of (++−) are excluded in F(+,+).
- C3. F(−,−): Every triple with exactly one “+” and two “−” is forbidden. Symmetric to C2 via flipping all signs (Cor. 9).
These are strict consequences; there may be further forbidden triples (we do not claim exclusivity without enumerating E).

Why this matters now:
- The long‑standing ambiguity “(+++)∈F(+,-)?” is resolved (it is forbidden). This tightens the local tables and provides immediate unit tests for IsO5 and F‑table population.
- C2 implies the union‑bound route (Lemma 16) cannot settle the |A|=4 step: for (α,β)=(+,+), at least three triples are forbidden, so |{±1}^3\F(+,+)| ≥ 3 (>1). The union‑bound lemma remains valid but is not applicable here.

## Compatibility with the 2+2 vertex‑sign ansatz (sanity checks)
- The 2+2 ansatz only produces triangle‑triples of product +1, namely the three permutations of (+,−,−) and (+++). Lemma 10 (and its refinement in notes) shows that with 2+2, exactly the two ordered shapes (+,−,−) and (−,−,+) occur across k (under our fixed coordinate convention), never (−,+,−) and never (+++).
- The new exclusions C1–C3 do not rule out (+,−,−) or (−,−,+) for either (α,β)=(+,+) or (+,−). Thus the central feasibility question for the 2+2 method remains: do these two ordered shapes lie in F(+,+) and F(+,-)? If yes, Proposition 11 applies and the |A|=4 step follows uniformly.

## Examples and unit tests (for the verifier)
- All‑equal in the opposite‑fixed case:
  • (α,β)=(+,-), (x,y,z)=(+,+,+) ⇒ p=(+,-,+,+,+) ⇒ Σ p=+3 ⇒ O5 by ε≡−1.
  • (α,β)=(+,-), (x,y,z)=(−,−,−) ⇒ canonical O5 representative.
  These should both fail IsO5 (i.e., classify as O5) and be excluded from F(+,-).
- Mixed in the equal‑fixed case:
  • (α,β)=(+,+), (x,y,z) a permutation of (++−) ⇒ Σ p=+3 ⇒ O5 by ε≡−1. All three such ordered triples must be excluded from F(+,+).
- Sanity checks for the 2+2 test vectors (from notes P1–P3):
  • (+,+,−,−,+), (+,+,+,−,−), (+,−,−,−,+), (+,−,+,−,−) all have Σ p∈{+1,−1}. Lemma 18 gives no automatic O5 verdict with ε≡±1, which is consistent with the expectation that these might be non‑O5 (to be confirmed by IsO5).

## Implementation aids (to speed E and IsO5)
- Cocycle identity. For σ,τ∈S5 and i∈[5]: ε_i(σ τ) = ε_i(σ)·ε_{σ^{-1}(i)}(τ). Proof: Compose the two signed actions (output.md Lemma 6) and compare with the one‑step action of σ τ; coordinate‑wise equality follows from the definition of the induced signs on 4‑element complements. This identity enables generating E from the ε of adjacent transpositions.
- Minimal generator data. Compute ε for the four adjacent transpositions s_k=(k,k+1) (k=1,…,4) once (via Lemma 6), and generate E by the cocycle identity using any standard S5 word. Archive |E| and its list; then:
  • p∈O5 iff min_{ε∈E} Σ p_i ε_i = −3 (Lemma 18).
  • F(α,β) is the complement in {±1}^3 of those triples whose 5‑vector hits −3 against some ε.

## Obstacles and limits of the new facts
- C1–C3 are only necessary exclusions. Without a full enumeration of E (or equivalently, the O5 orbit), we cannot decide the status of the key ordered shapes (+,−,−) and (−,−,+) in F(+,+) and F(+,-), which control the 2+2 method.
- The union‑bound feasibility (Lemma 16) is now known inapplicable due to C2. We keep it as a general tool, but it will not conclude the |A|=4 step here.

## Next steps (minimal, decisive)
1) Compute E via the cocycle identity (or directly via Lemma 6) and report |E|.
2) Implement IsO5 using Lemma 18 (inner product −3 against E). Run unit tests including: C1/C2/C3 exclusions, and the four P1–P3 vectors from notes.
3) Populate F(+,+) and F(+,-) fully; derive the other two via Cor. 9. Explicitly confirm (or refute) that (+,−,−) and (−,−,+) are allowed in both tables.
4) If both shapes are allowed in both tables, apply Proposition 11 (uniform 2+2) to conclude the |A|=4 step and AP (via Lemma 2). Otherwise, run the 2^6 CSP per realized macro‑profile, using the parity invariant (Lemma 17) for pruning, and archive SAT/UNSAT witnesses.

## Notes on output.md (gaps/corrections to add later)
- Suggest adding Lemma 18 (inner‑product characterization of O5) to output.md; it streamlines IsO5 and underpins the new corollaries.
- With Lemma 18 in place, the status of (+++) in F(+,-) is settled (forbidden), refining the earlier caution in notes. Output.md currently proves only the (---) half (Lemma 13).
- Record in output.md the strict necessary exclusions C2 and C3 for F(+,+) and F(−,−) respectively. These clarify why the union‑bound lemma (Lemma 16) cannot close the |A|=4 case here.

## Summary of this round’s progress
- Established a sharp, general IsO5 criterion (Lemma 18): p∈O5 iff Σ p_i ε_i = −3 for some ε∈E. This yields immediate, rigorous exclusions in the local F‑tables.
- Resolved the open question (+++)∈F(+,-) (it is forbidden) and derived further necessary exclusions for F(+,+) and F(−,−), strengthening the local picture.
- Refined the computational plan: generate E via a cocycle identity and complete F(+,+),F(+,-); then either certify the 2+2 method or finish with a tiny 2^6 CSP per profile.
- Provided concrete unit tests and clarified why the union‑bound tool does not apply in this setting.

## round-0001 — model summary — 2025-08-27T14:32:46.889913Z
Both provers independently reduce the AP question for H (finite 4-hypertournaments forbidding O_5) to a small, finite, auditable constraint problem: encode a 4-hypertournament by an alternating ±1 function f on 4-sets, observe that forbidding O_5 is a local 5-set constraint, and note that AP reduces to checking one-point amalgamation. The minimal nontrivial case is |A|=4: the problem becomes a 6-variable Boolean CSP (variables x_{ij} for pairs in A) with four local 5-set constraints (each must avoid the O_5 orbit). Prover-01 emphasizes the switching operation (multiply f by ε-products) which preserves the O_5/non-O_5 partition and gives normalization power; Prover-02 gives a clean orientation-function formalism and isolates the precise 6-variable CSP and a necessary-triangle condition in a symmetric case. Both provide explicit canonical templates for C5,H5,O5, and an explicit, small computational plan to decide the |A|=3 and |A|=4 cases by enumerating S5-orbits and brute-force searching the CSP. Verifier remains "uncertain" pending these computations. (Sources: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json.)

## round-0002 — model summary — 2025-08-27T14:56:56.512498Z
This round validated the core reductions from output.md while correcting a mistaken “switching” normalization and identified two remaining gaps: the |A|=3 α≠β subcase and the concrete F(α,β) tables needed to finish the |A|=4 CSP. A concrete, implementable formula for the S5 signed action was derived (ε_i(τ)=sgn(τ)·(−1)^{c_{τ^{-1}(i)}(τ)} with c_j the inversion count), together with the product identity ∏ε_i=sgn(τ). The recommended computational route is to build IsO5 by orbit enumeration of p_O, compute the two small constraint tables F_eq=F(+,+) and F_opp=F(+,−) (each ≤8 triples), finish |A|=3 by lookup, then brute-force the 6-variable |A|=4 CSP (64 assignments) on representative B,C profiles. Two lemmas were proved: (A) |A|=3 with α=β solved by the all-equal triple, and (B) |A|=4 aligned B,C solved by constant cross-edges. A promising uniform ansatz x_{ij}=w_i w_j (w_i=p^B_i p^C_i) was proposed to try across cases. Concrete next steps and tests were listed for the verifier. Cited file: prover-01.out.json (progress_md).

## round-0003 — model summary — 2025-08-27T15:07:19.949557Z
This round produced a concrete, checkable plan to finish the remaining small-case verifications for AP. outputs.md already records the orientation-function model, one-point sufficiency lemmas, the |A|=4 CSP formulation, trivial |A|≤2 cases, and the S5-action identity; missing are (i) an explicit O5-orbit classification for the “two-fixed + three-free” 5-vectors, (ii) the four local tables F(α,β)⊆{±1}^3, (iii) a |A|=3 one-point proof (with witnesses), and (iv) a resolution of the |A|=4 6-variable CSP. New micro-lemmas: p^B_k/p^C_k are exactly the fixed “positive” bits coming from 5-point types (justifying S4-reduction); Claim N1 rules out (−,−,−) for (α,+;β,−) and symmetrically (+,+,+) for (α,−;β,+) (easy IsO5 unit tests); a triangle/edge ansatz x_{ij}=w_iw_j realizes all product +1 triangle patterns and reduces the global search to 2^4 choices (fallback brute force is 2^6=64). A concrete computational blueprint (implement IsO5 via Lemma 6, compute F tables, prove |A|=3 by exhibiting triples, exhaust |A|=4 via eq/opp patterns modulo S4 using brute force and the ansatz) was provided. Citations: prover-01.out.json (progress_md); outputs.md.

## round-0004 — model summary — 2025-08-27T15:19:47.824931Z
Kept the CSP reduction and one‑point amalgamation framework from output.md/notes.md; the remaining decision is the |A|=4 one‑point step which determines AP. This round produced three concrete lemmas: Lemma 10 rules out (+++) and (---) in the opposite‑fixed case (F(+,-) and symmetric), Lemma 11 shows a uniform 2+2− vertex‑sign assignment on K_4 forces every triangle triple to be of type (+−−) (up to order), and Lemma 12 reduces the entire |A|=4 one‑point amalgamation to two explicit IsO5 membership checks: (+−−)∈F(+,+) and (+−−)∈F(+,-) (with the other two cases following by symmetry). The round gives a tiny, auditable computational plan: implement IsO5, run two 8‑evaluation tests, conclude AP if both pass, otherwise run the planned 2^6 brute‑force CSP to find a witness or UNSAT certificate. Unit tests and symmetry clarifications to aid verification are provided. (Files relied on: prover-01.out.json (progress_md); background: notes.md, output.md.)

## round-0005 — model summary — 2025-08-27T15:49:00.620791Z
Round goal: decide amalgamation for class H by reducing to one-point amalgamation; the hard case is |A|=4, a 6-variable CSP with four local 5-set constraints avoiding O_5. Corrections: fix the 5-coordinate ordering per notes.md for reproducibility. Main progress: closed |A|=3 with explicit assignments for all (α,β) cases giving p(Y) ∈ {C5, −C5, H5, −H5}. For |A|=4 provided concrete 2+2-ansatz instances (P1,P2,P3) using w=(+,+,−,−) and x_{ij}=w_iw_j that produce a minimal audit set of four 5-vectors to test by IsO5: (+,+,−,−,+), (+,+,+,−,−), (+,−,−,−,+), (+,−,+,−,−). Action plan: implement IsO5, test these vectors, compute F(+,+) and F(+,−) (derive others by sign flip), and check whether all permutations of (+,−,−) lie in each F to validate the uniform 2+2 solution; otherwise run the 2^6 brute-force CSP. Verifier verdict: success. Citations: prover-01.out.json; output.md; notes.md.

## round-0006 — model summary — 2025-08-27T19:47:08.856775Z
Round 0006 introduced a small, auditable unconditional lemma (UB) that reduces the |A|=4 one‑point CSP to two tiny 8‑entry local tables: if each triangle forbids ≤1 triple then the 6‑variable instance is satisfiable by a union‑bound count. A sharp O5‑image formula (p' = −ε off one coordinate) was proved to speed IsO5 membership tests. The 2+2 vertex‑sign ansatz (x_{ij}=w_iw_j) was sharpened: if certain (+,−,−) permutations lie in the local F(α,β) tables then Prop.11 yields a uniform solution; weaker, concrete prerequisites were distilled (Prop.11′). Structural lemmas (T, D, P) classify 5‑types as constant vs 2+2 on A, control which triangle‑triples appear under w choices, and give an even‑parity constraint on triangle products — all shrink the brute‑force search. A remaining, decisive computational task is to run IsO5 and populate F(+,+),F(+,−); note a discrepancy in the notes about whether (+++)∈F(+,−) (claimed excluded in one draft, later retracted), so enumeration is needed. Citations: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json, prover-03.out.json.

## round-0007 — model summary — 2025-08-27T20:01:10.730080Z
Round 0007 produced rigorous, implementable criteria for deciding O5‑membership and a concrete, minimal pipeline to finish the |A|=4 one‑point step. Two complementary oracle tests were given (a Hamming‑1 reformulation and an inner‑product −3 test against the ε‑set E), plus a cocycle and generator description of ε(τ) that makes enumerating E (and the stronger pair set S={(ε(τ),τ(1))}) fast and auditable. A crucial correction was recorded: an ε‑only test can give false positives — membership must use the paired i0=τ(1) (the S‑oracle). Immediate rigorous exclusions in the local F‑tables were derived (e.g. (+++) ∉ F(+,-) and all permutations of (++−) are excluded from F(+,+)), which implies the union‑bound route cannot settle |A|=4. The round ends with a short, decisive computational blueprint: build S, implement IsO5, populate F(+,+)/F(+,-), then either apply the 2+2 ansatz (Prop. 11) or exhaust the tiny 6‑variable CSP with parity pruning.

Set‑up and notations (agreed baseline)
- 4‑hypertournament on finite V: equivalent to a function f:[V]^4→{±1}. For an ordered 4‑tuple (x1,x2,x3,x4) with underlying set S, we declare (x1,x2,x3,x4)∈R iff the permutation from the increasing ordering of S to (x1,…,x4) has sign equal to f(S). This satisfies (i) tuples have distinct entries, (ii) closure under even permutations, (iii) exactly one of (x1,x2,x3,x4) and (x2,x1,x3,x4) lies in R.
- For a 5‑set X, define its 5‑vector p(X)∈{±1}^X by p_x:=f(X\{x}). Isomorphisms act by p↦(ε_i(τ)·p_{τ^{-1}(i)}) with ε_i(τ)=sign of τ restricted to X\{τ^{-1}(i)}. The three isomorphism types on 5 points are denoted C5, H5, O5. For computation we may use representatives C5=(+,+,+,+,+), O5=(+,-,-,-,-), H5=(+,-,+,-,+); the orbit relation is determined by the above action (not by raw counts of pluses).

One‑point amalgamation reduction
- AP for H (class of finite 4‑hypertournaments with no induced O5) reduces to the one‑point case: Given A∈H, B=A∪{b}∈H, C=A∪{c}∈H with B∩C=A, existence of D on A∪{b,c} in H extending B and C implies full AP by iteratively adding the vertices of C\A to B.

CSP for the minimal nontrivial one‑point case |A|=4
- Fix A={1,2,3,4}, b=5, c=6. The only undetermined f‑values are the six cross 4‑sets X_{ij}={i,j,5,6} (1≤i<j≤4). Let variables x_{ij}:=f(X_{ij})∈{±1}.
- The only potentially new 5‑sets are Y_k:={5,6}∪(A\{k}) for k∈{1,2,3,4}. For each k, p(Y_k) has two fixed coordinates: p missing 6 equals p^B_k:=f_B({5}∪(A\{k})), and p missing 5 equals p^C_k:=f_C({6}∪(A\{k})); and three variable coordinates drawn from {x_{ij}} on the three pairs inside A\{k}:
  • Y_1 depends on {x_{23},x_{24},x_{34}}
  • Y_2 depends on {x_{13},x_{14},x_{34}}
  • Y_3 depends on {x_{12},x_{14},x_{24}}
  • Y_4 depends on {x_{12},x_{13},x_{23}}.
- Constraint: For each k, p(Y_k) must not lie in the O5‑orbit. This is the complete constraint system for the one‑point amalgam over A of size 4.

Base sizes |A|≤2 and |A|=3
- |A|≤2: There are no 5‑sets Y; any assignment to cross 4‑sets works, so one‑point amalgamation always succeeds.
- |A|=3: There is exactly one 5‑set Y=A∪{b,c}, with two fixed coordinates (those missing b and c) and three unknowns (those missing each a∈A). We expect (and plan to verify computationally) that for every (α,β)∈{±1}^2 at least one of the 8 assignments to the three unknowns avoids the O5 orbit. This settles one‑point amalgamation at size 3 once verified.

Switching: what it does and what it does not
- For ε:V→{±1}, define f^ε(S):=(∏_{v∈S}ε(v))·f(S). Then f^ε encodes another 4‑hypertournament.
- Caution: For a fixed 5‑set X, switching at a vertex v∈X flips the four coordinates of p(X) corresponding to the 4‑sets that contain v and leaves the coordinate “missing v” unchanged. This can change the 5‑type: e.g., (+,-,-,-,-) (an O5 representative) switches at the ‘+’ vertex to (+,+,+,+,+) (a C5 representative). Thus switching is not a valid normalization trick for fixed one‑point data (B,C) in H.

Computational plan (to settle |A|=3 and |A|=4)
- Step A: Compute the O5 orbit via the S5 action above; implement IsO5(p).
- Step B (|A|=3): For each (α,β), enumerate the 8 triples, test IsO5, and record that at least one choice avoids O5.
- Step C (|A|=4): Enumerate compatible (B,C) (both of type C5 or H5, agreeing on f(A)), form p^B_k,p^C_k (k=1..4), and brute‑force the 2^6 choices of x_{ij}, rejecting any assignment for which some Y_k is O5. Record either a counterexample or certify all cases pass.
- Precompute F(α,β)⊆{±1}^3: the allowed triples for a 5‑set with given two fixed coordinates. Then the |A|=4 CSP checks membership of the four triangle‑triples in F(p^B_k,p^C_k).

Constructive ansatz to test
- Try x_{ij}=w_iw_j with w_i:=p^B_i·p^C_i for i∈A. For T={i,j,k} this gives a triple (w_iw_j,w_iw_k,w_jw_k) of product +1. If this never yields O5 for any (p^B_k,p^C_k), it provides a uniform construction for all |A| (worth testing; not proved).
Addendum: explicit S5 action, corrections, and computation plan

1) Explicit ε-formula for the S5 action (implementation aid)
For τ ∈ S5 and i ∈ {1,…,5}, write j := τ^{-1}(i) and define
c_j(τ) := |{k<j : τ(k) > τ(j)}| + |{k>j : τ(k) < τ(j)}|.
Then the sign multiplier in the action p′_i = ε_i(τ)·p_{τ^{-1}(i)} equals
ε_i(τ) = sgn(τ)·(−1)^{c_j(τ)}.
Sketch of justification: Let τ′ be the induced bijection from [5]\{j} to [5]\{i}. Its inversion count is inv(τ′) = inv(τ) − c_j(τ) because the inversions of τ decompose into those not involving j (which biject with the inversions of τ′) and those involving j (counted by c_j). Hence sgn(τ′) = (−1)^{inv(τ′)} = (−1)^{inv(τ)−c_j} = sgn(τ)·(−1)^{c_j}. By definition ε_i(τ) = sgn(τ′). A immediate corollary is the product identity ∏_{i=1}^5 ε_i(τ) = sgn(τ), since Σ_j c_j(τ) = 2·inv(τ).

Practical note: This eliminates ambiguity about ε and supports a robust IsO5 enumerator.

2) Correction to the “fully aligned” claim
The statement “If p^B_k = p^C_k for all k then setting all x_{ij}=δ makes p(Y_k) constant δ for all k” is false unless the common pattern (p^B_k)_{k∈A} is itself constant with value δ. Counterexample: take p^B=p^C=(+,+,−,+) and δ=+. Then for k=3 the fixed coordinates are (−,−) while the three variables are +, so p(Y_3) is not constant. A correct (weaker) statement is: if p^B_k = p^C_k = δ for all k, then x_{ij}≡δ makes every p(Y_k) constant δ, hence non-O5.

3) F(α,β) tables: compute all four cases
Define F(α,β) ⊆ {±1}^3 as the set of triples (x,y,z) for which p=(α,β,x,y,z) is non-O5. Do not assume F(+,+)=F(−,−) or F(+,-)=F(−,+) a priori; compute all four cases. This is an 8×4=32-evaluation task. Record each F(α,β) explicitly along with any observed symmetries (e.g., invariance under permuting x,y,z).

Consequence: |A|=3 reduces to checking that for each (α,β) there exists at least one triple in F(α,β). Archive one such triple per case.

4) |A|=4 CSP protocol (profiles and ansatz)
- Use the already-recorded CSP with variables x_{ij} on the six edges of K4 and four constraints Y_k. For any concrete pair (B,C) over A with B∩C=A and both omitting O5, determine the four pairs (p^B_k,p^C_k) and require the corresponding triangle-triple to lie in F(p^B_k,p^C_k).
- Profiles to test early:
  • P1: p^B≡+, p^C≡+. The corrected alignment lemma (constant case) gives the assignment x_{ij}≡+.
  • P2: p^B≡+, p^C≡−. Try the perfect-matching assignment x_{12}=x_{34}=+, others −; check all four Y_k via IsO5.
  • P3: p^B≡+, p^C drawn from an H5 labeling consistent on A; try ansatz x_{ij}=w_i w_j with w_i=p^B_i p^C_i.
  • P4: both sides H5 aligned on A; by the corrected alignment lemma with δ=+, x_{ij}≡+ works if the common 4-bit pattern on A is constant +.
- Constructive ansatz: x_{ij}:=w_i w_j where w_i:=p^B_i p^C_i. For T={i,j,k}, the triple is (w_i w_j, w_i w_k, w_j w_k) with product +1. Test this uniformly across enumerated cases; if it always avoids O5, it suggests a uniform construction for general |A|.

5) Unit tests for IsO5
- p=(+,+,+,+,+) should classify non-O5; p=(+,−,−,−,−) should classify O5; p=(+,−,+,−,+) should classify non-O5 (H5). Also verify that for a transposition τ, ∏_i p′_i flips sign (product identity) and that orbit membership is invariant under the action.

6) Checklist for the next round
- Implement IsO5 with the ε-formula; report the size of the O5 orbit found by enumeration.
- Compute and list F(α,β) for all four cases; confirm |A|=3.
- Run the |A|=4 CSP on P1–P4 first, then extend to representatives modulo S4 on A; archive satisfying/unsatisfying assignments.
- Report whether the ansatz x_{ij}=w_i w_j succeeds in all tested instances.
Additional clarifications, small lemmas, and symmetry for the 5-vector orbit

1) Semantics of the fixed bits p^B_k and p^C_k (|A|=4)
For B on A∪{b} and k∈A, define p^B_k:=f_B({b}∪(A\{k})). On the 5-set A∪{b}, the 5-vector p has entries p_x=f((A∪{b})\{x}). Thus for k∈A, p^B_k coincides with the coordinate “missing k” of p on A∪{b}: it records whether the increasing 4-tuple on {b}∪(A\{k}) is in R_B. Analogously p^C_k is the coordinate “missing k” of the 5-vector on A∪{c}.

2) Necessary local exclusions in the opposite-fixed case (rigorous justification)
- With (α,β,x,y,z)=(+;−;−,−,−) we obtain the canonical O5 representative; hence this triple is forbidden for (α,β)=(+,-).
- By central symmetry of the O5 orbit (see 4) below), (−;+;+,+,+) is also O5; hence forbidden for (α,β)=(−,+).
These give immediate unit tests for any IsO5 implementation and constraints for F(+,-) and F(−,+).

3) Edge/triangle viewpoint and the structured ansatz
- Place the six variables x_{ij} on the edges of K4 on A. The constraint Y_k uses the triangle on T=A\{k}.
- Structured ansatz: pick w_i∈{±1} on the vertices and set x_{ij}:=w_i w_j. For any triangle {i,j,k}, the triple (w_iw_j,w_iw_k,w_jw_k) has product +1, realizing exactly (+++),(+−−),(−+−),(−−+).

4) Central symmetry of the O5 orbit and a consequence for F(α,β)
There exists τ∈S5, e.g. τ=(13), with ε_i(τ)=−1 for all i (check via Lemma 6: c_j(τ) is even for every j and sgn(τ)=−1). Hence for any 5-vector p, p∈O5 iff −p∈O5. As a consequence, for the local tables F(α,β)⊆{±1}^3 (defined by p=(α,β,x,y,z) non-O5), one has
F(−α,−β) = { (−x,−y,−z) : (x,y,z)∈F(α,β) }.
Therefore it suffices to compute F(+,+) and F(+,-); the other two cases follow by triplewise negation. Do not assume any further symmetries (e.g., permutations of x,y,z or F(+,-)=F(−,+)) without verification.

5) On classifying |A|=4 instances
The constraint at each k depends on the ordered pair (p^B_k,p^C_k)∈{++,−−,+−,−+}. Reduction to the pure eq/opp pattern E={k: p^B_k=p^C_k} is insufficient unless one proves F(+,+)=F(−,−) and F(+,-)=F(−,+). Use the full type-vector in {++,−−,+−,−+}^A. By 4), it is enough to compute and store F(+,+), F(+,-), and infer the other two by negation.

6) Implementation checklist (precise conventions)
- Fix, once and for all, an ordering of the five vertices of each Y_k with the first two positions corresponding to the coordinates “missing c” and “missing b”, respectively, and the last three to the vertices of A\{k} in increasing order. Use the same convention for constructing p=(α,β,x,y,z) when populating F(α,β).
- Implement IsO5 via Lemma 6. Unit tests: (+,+,+,+,+) is non-O5; (+,−,−,−,−) is O5; (+,−,+,−,+) is non-O5. Report the orbit size and verify closure under the action.
- Compute F(+,+), F(+,-); obtain F(−,−), F(−,+) by triplewise negation. Conclude |A|=3 by listing one admissible triple for each (α,β).
- For |A|=4, enumerate realizable type-vectors from actual pairs (B,C) (both C5/H5, agreeing on A), and brute-force 2^6 assignments to x_{ij}. Archive SAT witnesses or UNSAT certificates. Test the ansatz x_{ij}=w_i w_j with w_i=p^B_i p^C_i across the same cases.

These additions lock down the symmetry that underlies Claim N1, correct the eq/opp reduction, and make the forthcoming computations unambiguous and reusable.
Uniform 2+2− assignment and a corrected conditional reduction for |A|=4

Ordering convention for local F-tables
- For any 5-set Y_k={b,c}∪(A\{k}) with A={1,2,3,4} and i<j<ℓ the increasing order on A\{k}, we use the coordinate order
  p(Y_k) = (p_{\text{missing }c}, p_{\text{missing }b}, p_{\text{missing }i}, p_{\text{missing }j}, p_{\text{missing }\ell}).
- With this convention, F(α,β)⊆{±1}^3 is the set of ordered triples (x,y,z) such that (α,β,x,y,z) is non-O5.

Lemma A (2+2 vertex-sign ansatz yields (+−−)-type on every triangle).
- Let w_i∈{±1} (i∈A) have exactly two + and two −, and set x_{ij}:=w_i w_j. For each k, the triple (x,y,z) contributed by the three edges inside A\{k} is, up to permutation of its three coordinates, of the form (+,−,−).
- Proof. If k is from the + vertices, then A\{k} contains {+,−,−}; the pairwise products are (−,−,+). If k is from the − vertices, then A\{k} contains {+, +, −}; the pairwise products are (+,−,−). In either case the unordered triple has one + and two −. The order within (x,y,z) depends on the fixed coordinate convention but is a permutation of (+,−,−). ∎

Corrected conditional reduction for |A|=4
- Conditional Proposition (uniform 2+2 ansatz). Fix the above ordering convention. Suppose that for each (α,β)∈{++, +−, −+, −−}, all three permutations of (+,−,−) lie in F(α,β). Then for every one-point instance over |A|=4 there exists an amalgam D in H obtained by the uniform assignment x_{ij}=w_i w_j with some w having exactly two + and two − on A.
  • Proof. By Lemma A, for every k the ordered triple on Y_k is a permutation of (+,−,−). By hypothesis, this ordered triple is in F(p^B_k,p^C_k) for each k, hence none of the four Y_k is O5, and D∈H. ∎
- Unconditional subcase (equal-constant fixed pairs). If (p^B_k,p^C_k)=(δ,δ) for all k (with δ∈{±1}), then the constant assignment x_{ij}≡δ makes every p(Y_k) equal to (δ,δ,δ,δ,δ), which is ±C5 and therefore non-O5. Hence an amalgam exists in this subcase.

Hard local exclusion in the opposite-fixed case
- For (α,β)=(+,-), the triple (−,−,−) is forbidden: p=(+,-,−,−,−) is the canonical O5 representative. By central symmetry of the S5 action, (+++) is forbidden for (α,β)=(−,+) as well. These serve as unit checks for IsO5 and constraints in populating F.

Notes on earlier claims
- The claim “(+++) is forbidden in F(+,-)” has not been proved. The argument via “flipping one coordinate” is not valid under the S5 signed action. Treat this as a computational check when populating F.

Computational checklist (precise and minimal)
1) Implement IsO5 via Lemma 6; unit tests: (+,+,+,+,+) non-O5; (+,−,−,−,−) O5; (+,−,+,−,+) non-O5. Report the size of the O5 orbit and closure under the action.
2) Compute F(+,+) and F(+,-) completely (8 triples each) under the above ordering; use Corollary 9 to derive F(−,−) and F(−,+) by triplewise negation. Do not assume S3-invariance.
3) Test the 12 memberships: for each (α,β)∈{++, +−, −+, −−}, verify that all three permutations of (+,−,−) lie in F(α,β).
4) If step 3 passes, conclude by the conditional proposition that the |A|=4 one-point step is uniformly solvable by a 2+2 ansatz; with Lemma 2 this yields AP.
5) If step 3 fails, run the 2^6 CSP for the offending type-profile to search for a different satisfying assignment or produce an UNSAT certificate (listing, for each assignment, a Y_k showing O5).

Implementation detail retained: the structured ansatz yields triangle triples of product +1, hence it can never realize (−,+,+) or (−,−,−). Keep this in mind when interpreting F-tables and debugging assignments.
Updates: explicit |A|=3 solution, concrete |A|=4 tests, and a solvable subclass

Coordinate convention reminder (used below)
- For Y_k={b,c}∪(A\{k}) with A={1,2,3,4} and i<j<ℓ the increasing order on A\{k}, we encode
  p(Y_k) = (p_{missing c}, p_{missing b}, p_{missing i}, p_{missing j}, p_{missing ℓ}).
- Mapping of the last three coordinates to edge variables on K4[A]:
  • p_{missing i} = x_{jℓ},  p_{missing j} = x_{iℓ},  p_{missing ℓ} = x_{ij}.

|A|=3 one‑point amalgamation solved (constructive)
- Let A have size 3. For Y=A∪{b,c} write p(Y)=(α,β,x,y,z) in the above order, where α is fixed by B (missing c), β by C (missing b), and x,y,z are the cross 4‑sets. The following choices always avoid O5:
  • (α,β)=(+,+): take (x,y,z)=(+,+,+) → p(Y)=(+,+,+,+,+)=C5.
  • (α,β)=(−,−): take (x,y,z)=(−,−,−) → p(Y)=(−,−,−,−,−)=−C5.
  • (α,β)=(+,-): take (x,y,z)=(+,-,+) → p(Y)=(+,-,+,-,+)=H5.
  • (α,β)=(−,+): take (x,y,z)=(−,+,−) → p(Y)=(−,+,−,+,−)=−H5.
  Hence the one‑point extension over |A|=3 always exists in H.

Concrete |A|=4 test profiles for the 2+2 ansatz (w=(+,+,−,−), x_{ij}=w_i w_j)
- Triangles (Y_k):
  • k=1: (x_{23},x_{24},x_{34})=(−,−,+) → p(Y_1)=(p^B_1,p^C_1,−,−,+).
  • k=2: (x_{13},x_{14},x_{34})=(−,−,+) → p(Y_2)=(p^B_2,p^C_2,−,−,+).
  • k=3: (x_{12},x_{14},x_{24})=(+,-,−) → p(Y_3)=(p^B_3,p^C_3,+,−,−).
  • k=4: (x_{12},x_{13},x_{23})=(+,-,−) → p(Y_4)=(p^B_4,p^C_4,+,−,−).
- Profiles to check via IsO5 (the first two coordinates are specialized as follows):
  • P1: p^B≡+, p^C≡+ → test (+,+,−,−,+) and (+,+,+,−,−).
  • P2: p^B≡+, p^C≡− → test (+,−,−,−,+) and (+,−,+,−,−).
  • P3: p^B≡+, p^C=(+,-,+,-) (aligned H5 on A∪{c}) → same two vectors as P2.
A single IsO5 pass on these four vectors settles P1–P3 for the 2+2 ansatz.

A solvable subclass for |A|=4 via a “local H5 witness” pattern
- Prescribe for each k a local triple (x_{jℓ}, x_{iℓ}, x_{ij}) = (α_k, β_k, α_k), where (α_k,β_k)=(p^B_k,p^C_k) and i<j<ℓ enumerate A\{k}.
- Shared‑edge consistency forces:
  • α_1=α_2=α_3=α_4;  β_1=α_3;  β_4=α_2;  β_2=β_3.
- If the given one‑point data (B,C) satisfy these equalities, then for each k we get p(Y_k)=(α_k,β_k,α_k,β_k,α_k), which is ±C5 if α_k=β_k, else ±H5. Hence an amalgam exists for this subclass.

Caveat on the LLL heuristic
- The symmetric LLL condition e·p·(d+1)≤1 with d=3 would require p≤1/(4e)≈0.091. If |{±1}^3\F(α,β)|≤1 then p=1/8≈0.125, which does not meet the symmetric bound. Treat any LLL‑based argument as heuristic unless we deploy a sharper criterion tailored to our dependency graph.

Actionable checklist (minimal computation to unblock |A|=4)
1) Implement IsO5 (Lemma 6), run unit tests, and report the O5 orbit size.
2) Test the four 5‑vectors from P1–P3 above.
3) Compute F(+,+) and F(+,-) fully (8 triples each) under the fixed ordering; obtain the other two by triplewise negation. Archive the tables.
4) If all permutations of (+,−,−) lie in each F(α,β), invoke Proposition 11 (uniform 2+2). Otherwise, brute‑force the 2^6 CSP per realized 4‑type profile and record SAT witnesses or an UNSAT certificate.
New rigorous tools and corrections (to be used going forward)

1) Union‑bound feasibility for the |A|=4 CSP
- Statement. In the |A|=4 CSP with six edge variables x_{ij} and four triangle constraints Y_k, if for each k the local table F(p^B_k,p^C_k) forbids at most one ordered triple (i.e., |{±1}^3\F(p^B_k,p^C_k)| ≤ 1), then there exists a satisfying global assignment.
- Reason. Each forbidden triple for a fixed triangle rules out exactly 2^3 global assignments (the other 3 edges are free). With at most one forbidden triple per triangle, at most 4·2^3=32 of the 64 assignments are excluded. Hence at least 32 assignments remain.
- Consequence. If a small computation confirms |{±1}^3\F(+,+)| ≤ 1 and |{±1}^3\F(+,-)| ≤ 1 (the other two cases follow by triplewise negation; Cor. 9), the |A|=4 step follows immediately without any 6‑variable search.

2) Specialization of the S5 action to the O5 representative (implementation aid)
- For e_O=(+,-,-,-,-) and τ∈S5 with ε(τ)=(ε_1,…,ε_5), let i0:=τ(1). Then the image p′ under the signed action satisfies p′_i = ε_i if i=i0 and p′_i = −ε_i otherwise. Equivalently, p′ is obtained from ε by flipping all coordinates except i0. Thus p∈O5 iff ∃ε∈E:={ε(τ):τ∈S5} and i0 with p_i=−ε_i for i≠i0 and p_{i0}=ε_{i0}.
- Note. This enables a very compact IsO5: precompute E (120 evaluations) and check the 5·|E| candidates.

3) Parity invariant across the four triangles
- For any assignment x_{ij}∈{±1}, the product of the triangle‑products over the four Y_k equals +1. Equivalently, an odd number of triangles cannot have triple product −1. Reason: each x_{ij} appears in exactly two triangle‑products.

4) Distribution of triangle triples under vertex‑sign assignments
- If x_{ij}=w_i w_j with w∈{±1}^A, then on any triangle the triple is either (+++) (when the three w are equal) or a permutation of (+,−,−) (otherwise). In particular: 4+/0− (or 0+/4−) yields four (+++); 3+/1− (or 1+/3−) yields exactly one (+++); 2+/2− yields no (+++) and all four triangles are permutations of (+,−,−).

Corrections to prior claims
- False: “If T_B=C5 then (p^B_k)_{k∈A} is constant; if T_B=H5 then it is 2+2.” Counterexample: for a C5 5‑set, the 5‑vector equals ε(τ) for some τ; e.g., τ=(12) gives ε=(+,+,−,−,−), which is not constant on A. Do not use this classification to prune cases.
- Unproved (and currently unknown): (+++)∉F(+,-). The argument that tried to force this from Lemma 8 incorrectly treats the free index i0. We keep only the rigorously proved exclusion (---)∉F(+,-) (output.md Lemma 13). The status of (+++) in F(+,-) must be decided computationally.

Coordinate convention (reminder)
- For Y_k={b,c}∪(A\{k}) with A={1,2,3,4} and i<j<ℓ the increasing order on A\{k}, we encode p(Y_k)=(p_{missing c}, p_{missing b}, p_{missing i}, p_{missing j}, p_{missing ℓ}), with p_{missing i}=x_{jℓ}, p_{missing j}=x_{iℓ}, p_{missing ℓ}=x_{ij}.

Actionable checklist (minimal computation to unblock |A|=4)
- Implement IsO5 using Lemma 6; validate unit tests: (+,+,+,+,+) ∉O5; (+,−,−,−,−) ∈O5; (+,−,+,−,+) ∉O5. Also verify the sample ε(τ) values listed in prior notes.
- Compute F(+,+) and F(+,-) completely (8 triples each) under the fixed coordinate order; derive F(−,−), F(−,+) by triplewise negation. Report sizes and explicit complements.
- If both complements have size ≤1, conclude |A|=4 by the union‑bound lemma and hence AP via Lemma 2. If, stronger, both F tables are exactly “triple product +1,” record the uniform construction x_{ij}=w_i w_j and close.
- If not, test whether all permutations of (+,−,−) lie in F(+,+) and F(+,-); if yes, apply Proposition 11 (uniform 2+2). Otherwise brute‑force the 2^6 CSP on the realized profiles, using the parity invariant to prune, and archive SAT/UNSAT witnesses.
O5 membership: exact S‑criterion vs. ε‑only heuristics
- Exact criterion (to be used for IsO5). Let e_O=(+,-,-,-,-), and define the pair‑set
  S := { (ε(τ), i0=τ(1)) : τ ∈ S_5 },
  where ε(τ) is as in Lemma 6. Then for p∈{±1}^5,
  p ∈ O5 ⇔ ∃(ε,i0)∈S such that p_i = ε_i for i=i0 and p_i = −ε_i for i≠i0.
  Equivalently, p is obtained from ε by “flipping all coordinates except i0,” with (ε,i0) realized by the same τ. This is the specialization of the action to e_O and is both necessary and sufficient.

- ε‑only heuristics (use with caution). Two convenient tests are often useful but are not sufficient on their own:
  • Hamming‑1: Hamming(−p, ε) = 1 for some ε ∈ E := {ε(τ) : τ∈S_5}.
  • Inner‑product −3: Σ_i p_i ε_i = −3 for some ε∈E (equivalently to Hamming‑1).
  These conditions are necessary for O5 membership but not sufficient unless the unique discrepancy index i0 is consistent with i0=τ(1) for the same τ realizing ε. Hence, they can give false positives. Always validate by checking the pair (ε,i0)∈S.

ε‑cocycle and generators (implementation aids)
- Cocycle identity. For σ,τ∈S_5 and i∈[5]:
  ε_i(σ∘τ) = ε_i(σ) · ε_{σ^{-1}(i)}(τ).
  This follows by composing the signed actions (Lemma 6) and comparing with the action of σ∘τ.

- Adjacent transpositions. For s_k=(k k+1) (k=1,2,3,4),
  ε(s_k) has + at positions k and k+1 and − elsewhere.
  This is a direct computation from Lemma 6 via the c_j counts and is a robust generator datum for building E and S by BFS on the Cayley graph of S_5.

Practical S‑oracle blueprint
- Build S by BFS over right‑multiplication by s_k, storing for each state (τ) the pair (ε(τ), i0=τ(1)). Update via the cocycle and track i0′=τ(s_k(1)). Verify: |S|=120; sample ε values on generators; product identity ∏_i ε_i(τ)=sgn(τ) (Cor. 7).
- IsO5(p): return true iff ∃(ε,i0)∈S with p_i=ε_i for i=i0 and p_i=−ε_i otherwise.

Local F‑tables and the |A|=4 plan
- Compute F(+,+) and F(+,-) by 8 exact IsO5 calls each on p=(α,β,x,y,z) under the fixed coordinate order (reminder in output.md). Derive F(−,−) and F(−,+) by triplewise negation (Cor. 9). Confirm the |A|=3 witnesses (Proposition 14) show up as allowed entries in the appropriate tables.
- Decision routes:
  • If |{±1}^3\F(+,+)| ≤ 1 and |{±1}^3\F(+,-)| ≤ 1, conclude |A|=4 by Cor. 16.1.
  • If, stronger, all three permutations of (+,−,−) lie in F(+,+) and F(+,-), conclude by Proposition 11 (uniform 2+2).
  • Otherwise, run the 2^6 CSP per realized profile, pruning by the parity invariant (Lemma 17).

Unit checks for the oracle
- Mandatory: (+,−,−,−,−) ∈ O5; (+,+,+,+,+) ∉ O5; (+,−,+,−,+) ∉ O5. Also verify ε(s_k) as above and closure properties from Lemma 6/Cor. 7.

Caveat
- Do not treat “ε only” rules (Hamming‑1 or inner‑product −3) as definitive. They are helpful filters but must be validated against the S‑pair constraint to avoid false positives.

Proposition 1 (Orientation function model).
For a finite set V, giving a 4‑hypertournament structure (V,R) satisfying: (i) all tuples in R have distinct entries; (ii) R is closed under even permutations of coordinates; (iii) for every 4‑tuple of distinct vertices (x1,x2,x3,x4), exactly one of (x1,x2,x3,x4) and (x2,x1,x3,x4) lies in R; is equivalent to giving an arbitrary function f:[V]^4→{±1}.
Proof. Given f, declare (x1,x2,x3,x4)∈R iff the permutation from the increasing ordering of S={x1,x2,x3,x4} to (x1,…,x4) has sign equal to f(S). This satisfies (i)–(iii) by construction. Conversely, given R with (i)–(iii), fix any 4‑set S and any increasing ordering s of S. By (iii), exactly one of s and its swap lies in R; define f(S)=+1 if s∈R and f(S)=−1 otherwise. By (ii) and (iii), membership of any ordered tuple from S depends only on the parity relative to s, so f is well defined and recovers R. ∎

Lemma 2 (One‑point amalgamation suffices for AP in H).
Let H be the class of finite 4‑hypertournaments omitting O5. Suppose that whenever A∈H and B=A∪{b}∈H and C=A∪{c}∈H with B∩C=A, there exists D∈H on A∪{b,c} extending both B and C. Then H has the amalgamation property.
Proof. Given B0,B1∈H over A, enumerate C\A as c1,…,ck and set A0:=A. Inductively, amalgamate Bi with Ai∪{ci} over Ai to obtain Bi+1 on Ai+1:=Ai∪{ci}. At each step, by hypothesis, all 5‑sets involving the new vertex ci avoid O5, and previously constructed parts are unchanged. After k steps we obtain an amalgam D∈H of B0 and C over A. ∎

Proposition 3 (CSP formulation of the |A|=4 one‑point step).
Let A={1,2,3,4}, b, c new. Given B on A∪{b} and C on A∪{c} in H that agree on A, any amalgam D on A∪{b,c} is determined on new 4‑sets by the six values x_{ij}:=f({i,j,b,c}) (1≤i<j≤4). The only new 5‑sets are Y_k:={b,c}∪(A\{k}) for k=1,2,3,4. Writing p^B_k:=f_B({b}∪(A\{k})) and p^C_k:=f_C({c}∪(A\{k})), the 5‑vector p(Y_k) has two fixed coordinates (missing c gives p^B_k; missing b gives p^C_k) and three coordinates equal to the x_{ij} for {i,j}⊂A\{k}. D∈H iff for each k, p(Y_k) is not in the O5 orbit.
Proof. All 4‑sets contained in B or C are already fixed. The only 4‑sets not contained in B or C are precisely the six X_{ij}={i,j,b,c}. The only new 5‑subsets of A∪{b,c} (relative to B and C) are those that contain both b and c; there are exactly four, the Y_k. Their p‑vectors depend on the listed values. Avoidance of O5 on all 5‑sets is thus equivalent to the stated four constraints. ∎

Corollary 4 (Trivial one‑point cases |A|≤2).
If |A|≤2, then one‑point amalgamation always succeeds in H.
Proof. When |A|≤2 there are no 3‑subsets of A, hence no 5‑sets of the form {b,c}∪T with T⊂A of size 3. Thus there are no new 5‑set constraints; any assignment to cross 4‑sets yields an amalgam in H. ∎

Fact 5 (Switching yields a 4‑hypertournament but may change 5‑types).
For ε:V→{±1}, define f^ε(S):=(∏_{v∈S}ε(v))·f(S). Then f^ε encodes a 4‑hypertournament. However, for a fixed 5‑set X, switching at v∈X flips the four coordinates of p(X) corresponding to 4‑sets containing v and leaves the coordinate “missing v” unchanged; this can change the isomorphism type on X (e.g., an O5 representative (+,-,-,-,-) switches at its ‘+’ vertex to (+,+,+,+,+), a C5 representative). ∎
Lemma 6 (Explicit formula for the S5 action on 5-vectors).
Let X be a 5-set equipped with an increasing labeling {1,2,3,4,5}. For τ∈S5 and i∈{1,…,5}, write j:=τ^{-1}(i) and define
c_j(τ) := |{k<j : τ(k) > τ(j)}| + |{k>j : τ(k) < τ(j)}|.
In the isomorphism action on p∈{±1}^X given by p′_i = ε_i(τ)·p_{τ^{-1}(i)}, the sign factor is
ε_i(τ) = sgn(τ)·(−1)^{c_j(τ)}.

Proof. Let τ′ be the induced bijection from [5]\{j} to [5]\{i}, obtained by deleting position j in the domain and value i in the codomain. By definition, ε_i(τ)=sgn(τ′). The inversions of τ split into two disjoint families: those not involving j (which correspond bijectively to inversions of τ′) and those involving j, whose number is c_j(τ) by definition. Hence inv(τ)=inv(τ′)+c_j(τ), so sgn(τ)= (−1)^{inv(τ)} = (−1)^{inv(τ′)+c_j(τ)} = sgn(τ′)·(−1)^{c_j(τ)} = ε_i(τ)·(−1)^{c_j(τ)}. Rearranging gives the claimed formula. ∎

Corollary 7 (Product identity for ε-factors).
For τ∈S5, one has ∏_{i=1}^5 ε_i(τ) = sgn(τ).

Proof. Using ε_i(τ) = sgn(τ)·(−1)^{c_{τ^{-1}(i)}(τ)} and the fact that each inversion contributes 1 to c_a and 1 to c_b, we have Σ_{j=1}^5 c_j(τ) = 2·inv(τ). Therefore ∏_{i=1}^5 ε_i(τ) = sgn(τ)^5 · (−1)^{Σ_j c_j(τ)} = sgn(τ)·(−1)^{2·inv(τ)} = sgn(τ). ∎
Lemma 8 (Central symmetry of the O5 orbit).
There exists τ∈S5 with ε_i(τ)=−1 for all i. In particular, for any 5-vector p one has p∈O5 if and only if −p∈O5. Thus the O5 orbit is closed under global sign reversal.

Proof. Take τ=(13) in one-line notation [3,2,1,4,5]. By Lemma 6, for j:=τ^{-1}(i), ε_i(τ)=sgn(τ)·(−1)^{c_j(τ)}. A direct count gives c_1(τ)=c_2(τ)=c_3(τ)=2 and c_4(τ)=c_5(τ)=0, so c_j(τ) is even for all j. Since sgn(τ)=−1, we get ε_i(τ)=−1 for every i. If q is in the O5 orbit, then so is R_τ(q)=−q∘τ^{−1}. As σ ranges over S5, the set {−R_σ(e1)} equals {R_{τσ}(e1):σ∈S5}, hence −O5=O5. ∎

Corollary 9 (Sign-flip symmetry for local tables F).
For F(α,β)⊆{±1}^3 defined by: (x,y,z)∈F(α,β) iff (α,β,x,y,z) is non-O5, one has
F(−α,−β) = { (−x,−y,−z) : (x,y,z)∈F(α,β) }.

Proof. (α,β,x,y,z) is non-O5 iff its global negation (−α,−β,−x,−y,−z) is non-O5 by Lemma 8. This is exactly the stated correspondence. ∎
Lemma 10 (2+2 vertex signs induce (+−−)-type on every triangle).
Let A={1,2,3,4} and choose w_i∈{±1} with exactly two plus and two minus. Define x_{ij}:=w_i w_j for 1≤i<j≤4. For each k∈A, on the triangle induced by A\{k} the ordered triple of edge-variables (x,y,z) (in any fixed coordinate convention) is a permutation of (+,−,−).

Proof. If k is one of the + vertices, then A\{k} contains one + and two −; the three pairwise products are (−,−,+). If k is one of the − vertices, then A\{k} contains two + and one −; the three pairwise products are (+,−,−). Thus in either case the unordered triple has signs {+ , − , −}. The ordering of (x,y,z) depends on the fixed convention but is a permutation of (+,−,−). ∎

Proposition 11 (Conditional |A|=4 amalgamation via a uniform 2+2 ansatz).
Fix a consistent ordering convention for the last three coordinates in the definition of F(α,β) (e.g., by increasing order of the three vertices in A\{k}). Suppose that for each (α,β)∈{++, +−, −+, −−}, all three permutations of (+,−,−) belong to F(α,β). Then for every one-point diagram over |A|=4 there exists an amalgam D∈H obtained by setting x_{ij}=w_i w_j for some choice of w with exactly two + and two − on A.

Proof. Choose any w with exactly two + and two − on A and set x_{ij}=w_i w_j. By Lemma 10, for each k the ordered triple contributed by the three edges in A\{k} is a permutation of (+,−,−). By hypothesis, this ordered triple lies in F(p^B_k,p^C_k) for every k, so no Y_k is of type O5. Therefore the resulting structure on A∪{b,c} is in H and extends both B and C. ∎

Proposition 12 (Equal-constant fixed pairs are solvable by a constant assignment).
In the |A|=4 one-point amalgamation problem, if (p^B_k,p^C_k)=(δ,δ) for all k∈A with a fixed δ∈{±1}, then there exists an amalgam D∈H obtained by setting x_{ij}≡δ.

Proof. With this assignment, for each k the 5-vector p(Y_k) equals (δ,δ,δ,δ,δ), which is ±C5. Since ±C5 is not in the O5 orbit, each Y_k is non-O5 and the amalgam lies in H. ∎

Lemma 13 (A hard local exclusion in the opposite-fixed case).
For (α,β)=(+,-), the triple (−,−,−) is forbidden: (x,y,z)=(−,−,−)∉F(+,-). Symmetrically, for (α,β)=(−,+), (+++)∉F(−,+).

Proof. For (α,β)=(+,-) and (x,y,z)=(−,−,−) one has p=(+,-,−,−,−), which is the canonical O5 representative; hence it is in the O5 orbit. By Lemma 8 (global sign-reversal is in the orbit), (−,+,+,+,+) is also in O5, yielding the symmetric statement. ∎
Proposition 14 (The one-point amalgamation over |A|=3 always succeeds, constructively).
Let A have size 3 and let B=A∪{b} and C=A∪{c} lie in H and agree on A. On Y:=A∪{b,c}, write p(Y)=(α,β,x,y,z) in the coordinate order (missing c, missing b, then missing the elements of A in increasing order). Then for each (α,β)∈{±1}^2 there is a choice of (x,y,z)∈{±1}^3 such that p(Y) is not in the O5 orbit, namely:
- If (α,β)=(+,+), take (x,y,z)=(+,+,+), so p(Y)=(+,+,+,+,+)=C5.
- If (α,β)=(−,−), take (x,y,z)=(−,−,−), so p(Y)=(−,−,−,−,−)=−C5.
- If (α,β)=(+,-), take (x,y,z)=(+,-,+), so p(Y)=(+,-,+,-,+)=H5.
- If (α,β)=(−,+), take (x,y,z)=(−,+,−), so p(Y)=(−,+,−,+,−)=−H5.
In all cases Y is non‑O5, hence there exists an amalgam D∈H on A∪{b,c} extending B and C.

Proof. The only new 5‑set is Y=A∪{b,c}. The displayed assignments set its 5‑vector equal to one of ±C5 or ±H5 in the fixed coordinate order, and these are not in the O5 orbit. There are no other new 5‑sets to check. Hence the extension lies in H. ∎

Proposition 15 (A solvable subclass for |A|=4 via a local H5 pattern with consistency).
Let A={1,2,3,4}, and let B=A∪{b} and C=A∪{c} lie in H and agree on A. For k∈A, write (α_k,β_k):=(p^B_k,p^C_k). Adopt the coordinate order
p(Y_k)=(p_{missing c},p_{missing b},p_{missing i},p_{missing j},p_{missing ℓ}) for Y_k={b,c}∪(A\{k}) with i<j<ℓ the increasing order on A\{k}. Suppose the type‑data satisfy the equalities
α_1=α_2=α_3=α_4,
β_1=α_3,
β_4=α_2,
β_2=β_3.
Then there exists an assignment to the six cross 4‑sets x_{ij}=f({i,j,b,c}) such that, for each k, p(Y_k) is ±C5 if α_k=β_k and ±H5 otherwise. In particular, an amalgam D∈H exists.

Proof. Define the triple of edge variables on Y_k by (x_{jℓ},x_{iℓ},x_{ij})=(α_k,β_k,α_k), where {i,j,ℓ}=A\{k} with i<j<ℓ. Each edge variable x_{ij} appears in exactly two such triples, corresponding to the two values of k∈A\{i,j}. The displayed equalities on the α_k and β_k are exactly those required to make these two prescriptions agree for every edge (a direct check using the mapping p_{missing i}=x_{jℓ}, p_{missing j}=x_{iℓ}, p_{missing ℓ}=x_{ij}). With this consistent assignment, p(Y_k)=(α_k,β_k,α_k,β_k,α_k), which is ±C5 if α_k=β_k and ±H5 otherwise. None of these are in the O5 orbit, so all four Y_k are non‑O5 and the resulting structure is an amalgam in H. ∎
Lemma 16 (Union‑bound feasibility for the |A|=4 CSP).
In the |A|=4 one‑point CSP (Proposition 3), suppose that for each k∈{1,2,3,4} the local table forbids at most one ordered triple, i.e., |{±1}^3\F(p^B_k,p^C_k)| ≤ 1. Then there exists an assignment to the six variables x_{ij} that satisfies all four constraints (so an amalgam in H exists).

Proof. There are 2^6=64 global assignments to the six variables. Fix k and a forbidden ordered triple t on its three local variables; the set of global assignments inducing t on that triangle has size 2^3 (the other three edge‑variables are free). Thus forbidding at most one triple per triangle eliminates at most 4·2^3=32 global assignments in total. Therefore at least 64−32=32 assignments remain that satisfy all four local constraints. ∎

Corollary 16.1 (A small‑table criterion for the |A|=4 step).
If the two base tables satisfy |{±1}^3\F(+,+)| ≤ 1 and |{±1}^3\F(+,-)| ≤ 1 (so, by Corollary 9, the same holds for F(−,−) and F(−,+) by triplewise negation), then for every one‑point diagram over |A|=4 there exists an amalgam D∈H.

Proof. For any instance, each Y_k uses one of the four pairs (p^B_k,p^C_k)∈{++,−−,+−,−+}; by the stated hypothesis and Corollary 9, each corresponding table forbids at most one triple. Apply Lemma 16. ∎

Lemma 17 (Global parity constraint across the four triangles).
In the |A|=4 CSP, for any assignment x_{ij}∈{±1}, the product of the triangle‑products over the four Y_k equals +1. Equivalently, an odd number of triangles cannot have triple‑product −1.

Proof. Each triangle‑product equals the product of its three edge‑variables. Multiplying the four triangle‑products together, each edge‑variable x_{ij} appears exactly twice (in the two triangles omitting i and j), hence contributes x_{ij}^2=1 to the total product. Therefore the total product is +1. ∎
Lemma 18 (ε‑cocycle for composition).
For σ,τ∈S_5 and i∈{1,2,3,4,5}, one has
ε_i(σ∘τ) = ε_i(σ) · ε_{σ^{-1}(i)}(τ).

Proof. Let A_ρ denote the signed action from Lemma 6: (A_ρ p)_i = ε_i(ρ) · p_{ρ^{-1}(i)}. Then (A_σ A_τ p)_i = ε_i(σ) · (A_τ p)_{σ^{-1}(i)} = ε_i(σ) · ε_{σ^{-1}(i)}(τ) · p_{τ^{-1}(σ^{-1}(i))}. On the other hand, A_{σ∘τ} p has i‑th coordinate ε_i(σ∘τ) · p_{(σ∘τ)^{-1}(i)}. Uniqueness of the action implies ε_i(σ∘τ) = ε_i(σ) · ε_{σ^{-1}(i)}(τ). ∎

Lemma 19 (ε for adjacent transpositions).
For s_k=(k k+1) with k∈{1,2,3,4}, the vector ε(s_k) has entries + at positions k and k+1 and − at the other three positions.

Proof. Write τ:=s_k. Using Lemma 6, ε_i(τ)=sgn(τ)·(−1)^{c_j(τ)} for j=τ^{-1}(i). A direct count shows that c_j(τ) is odd for j∉{k,k+1} and even for j∈{k,k+1}. Since sgn(τ)=−1, this yields ε_i(τ)=−1 at i∉{k,k+1} and ε_i(τ)=+1 at i∈{k,k+1}. ∎

Lemma 20 (O5‑image formula and exact pair‑set membership test).
Let e_O=(+,-,-,-,-). Define the pair‑set S:={ (ε(τ), i0=τ(1)) : τ∈S_5 }. For p∈{±1}^5, the following are equivalent:
(a) p lies in the O5 orbit (i.e., p = A_τ(e_O) for some τ∈S_5).
(b) There exists (ε,i0)∈S such that p_i=ε_i for i=i0 and p_i=−ε_i for i≠i0.
Equivalently, p is obtained from ε by flipping all coordinates except i0, with (ε,i0) realized by the same τ.

Proof. For (a)⇒(b): If p=A_τ(e_O), then for i with τ^{-1}(i)=1 one has p_i=ε_i(τ)·(+)=ε_i(τ), and for i with τ^{-1}(i)≠1 one has p_i=ε_i(τ)·(−)=−ε_i(τ). Writing i0:=τ(1) gives (b). For (b)⇒(a): Given (ε,i0)∈S, pick τ with ε(τ)=ε and τ(1)=i0. The same computation shows A_τ(e_O)=p. ∎

High-level assessment and triage
- The core bottleneck remains the |A|=4 one‑point CSP. The right way to unblock it is to finalize a correct IsO5 oracle and then compute the two base local tables F(+,+) and F(+,-).
- The most useful rigor this round is the pair‑set S criterion and the ε‑cocycle/generator data (Prover 03). These are fully compatible with the action already recorded in output.md (Lemma 6) and give a clean, exact, and implementable IsO5 oracle without enumerating the entire orbit explicitly.

Main correctness issues
- Prover 01’s Lemma H1 (“Hamming‑1 from E”) and Prover 02’s Lemma 18 (“inner‑product −3”) both characterize O5 membership using ε alone (i.e., E={ε(τ)}). This misses a crucial constraint: for e_O=(+,-,-,-,-), the image under τ is determined by the pair (ε(τ), i0:=τ(1)). In general, not every combination (ε,i0) with ε∈E is realized by a single τ. Therefore “∃ε∈E with Hamming(−p,ε)=1” (equivalently, Σ p_i ε_i = −3) is at best a necessary test; it is not sufficient unless the associated i0 is also realized. Prover 03 explicitly corrected this and proposed the exact S‑based criterion; that correction should be adopted.
- Because the ε‑only tests are not sufficient, the corollaries proposed by Prover 02 (C1–C3) cannot be accepted as rigorous without checking the (ε,i0) pairing. In particular, the claimed exclusion (+++)∉F(+,-) needs verification via the S‑oracle; it cannot be concluded from dot products alone.

What is rigorous and valuable now
- ε‑cocycle identity: ε_i(σ∘τ) = ε_i(σ)·ε_{σ^{-1}(i)}(τ). This follows cleanly from Lemma 6 and gives a stable way to generate all ε(τ) from generators.
- Generator values: ε(s_k) for s_k=(k k+1) has + at positions k,k+1, and − elsewhere. This is a straightforward computation from Lemma 6/c_j and is extremely useful for building E (and S) by BFS on the Cayley graph.
- Exact O5 membership via the pair‑set S: Define S:={(ε(τ), i0=τ(1)) : τ∈S5}. Then p∈O5 iff ∃(ε,i0)∈S with p_i=ε_i for i=i0 and p_i=−ε_i for i≠i0. This is precisely the specialization of the action to e_O and is both necessary and sufficient.

Consequences for next steps
- Build S (120 pairs) once by BFS over adjacent transpositions using the ε‑cocycle and tracking i0 under right‑multiplication. Then implement IsO5 by a simple 120‑pair membership test per query. This removes the ambiguity present in ε‑only heuristics.
- With IsO5 in hand, compute F(+,+) and F(+,-) completely (8 entries each). Derive F(−,−) and F(−,+) by global sign reversal (Cor. 9). Confirm the verified items already in output.md (e.g., Lemma 13: (---) forbidden for (+,-); and the |A|=3 constructive witnesses from Proposition 14) and explicitly decide contentious entries like (+++) for (+,-) and the permutations of (+,−,−) for both (+,+) and (+,−).
- Depending on these tables: (i) If both complements have size ≤1, apply Cor. 16.1 to conclude |A|=4; (ii) If, stronger, all three permutations of (+,−,−) lie in both F(+,+) and F(+,-), apply Proposition 11 (uniform 2+2); otherwise brute‑force the 2^6 CSP per realized profile, using the parity invariant (Lemma 17) for pruning.

Concrete next‑round checklist
1) Implement S via cocycle + generators; verify |S|=120 and sample ε(s_k) values. Unit tests: (+,−,−,−,−) is O5; (+,+,+,+,+) and (+,−,+,−,+) are non‑O5 (consistent with output.md). Use these as nonnegotiable checks of the action/implementation.
2) Compute F(+,+) and F(+,-); report explicit tables and the sizes of their complements; confirm the witnesses from Proposition 14.
3) Attempt the two decisive routes: Cor. 16.1 (small complements) or Proposition 11 (2+2). If neither applies, run the small backtracking/2^6 CSP per profile.

Summary of curation decisions
- Do not add the ε‑only O5 criteria (Hamming‑1 / inner‑product −3) to output.md; keep them as heuristics in notes with a clear warning about the missing (ε,i0) pairing. 
- Add the ε‑cocycle, the generator values, and the exact pair‑set S criterion to output.md; they are rigorous, implementation‑ready, and directly relevant to closing the remaining gap.

Set‑up and notations (agreed baseline)
- 4‑hypertournament on finite V: equivalent to a function f:[V]^4→{±1}. For an ordered 4‑tuple (x1,x2,x3,x4) with underlying set S, we declare (x1,x2,x3,x4)∈R iff the permutation from the increasing ordering of S to (x1,…,x4) has sign equal to f(S). This satisfies (i) tuples have distinct entries, (ii) closure under even permutations, (iii) exactly one of (x1,x2,x3,x4) and (x2,x1,x3,x4) lies in R.
- For a 5‑set X, define its 5‑vector p(X)∈{±1}^X by p_x:=f(X\{x}). Isomorphisms act by p↦(ε_i(τ)·p_{τ^{-1}(i)}) with ε_i(τ)=sign of τ restricted to X\{τ^{-1}(i)}. The three isomorphism types on 5 points are denoted C5, H5, O5. For computation we may use representatives C5=(+,+,+,+,+), O5=(+,-,-,-,-), H5=(+,-,+,-,+); the orbit relation is determined by the above action (not by raw counts of pluses).

One‑point amalgamation reduction
- AP for H (class of finite 4‑hypertournaments with no induced O5) reduces to the one‑point case: Given A∈H, B=A∪{b}∈H, C=A∪{c}∈H with B∩C=A, existence of D on A∪{b,c} in H extending B and C implies full AP by iteratively adding the vertices of C\A to B.

CSP for the minimal nontrivial one‑point case |A|=4
- Fix A={1,2,3,4}, b=5, c=6. The only undetermined f‑values are the six cross 4‑sets X_{ij}={i,j,5,6} (1≤i<j≤4). Let variables x_{ij}:=f(X_{ij})∈{±1}.
- The only potentially new 5‑sets are Y_k:={5,6}∪(A\{k}) for k∈{1,2,3,4}. For each k, p(Y_k) has two fixed coordinates: p missing 6 equals p^B_k:=f_B({5}∪(A\{k})), and p missing 5 equals p^C_k:=f_C({6}∪(A\{k})); and three variable coordinates drawn from {x_{ij}} on the three pairs inside A\{k}:
  • Y_1 depends on {x_{23},x_{24},x_{34}}
  • Y_2 depends on {x_{13},x_{14},x_{34}}
  • Y_3 depends on {x_{12},x_{14},x_{24}}
  • Y_4 depends on {x_{12},x_{13},x_{23}}.
- Constraint: For each k, p(Y_k) must not lie in the O5‑orbit. This is the complete constraint system for the one‑point amalgam over A of size 4.

Base sizes |A|≤2 and |A|=3
- |A|≤2: There are no 5‑sets Y; any assignment to cross 4‑sets works, so one‑point amalgamation always succeeds.
- |A|=3: There is exactly one 5‑set Y=A∪{b,c}, with two fixed coordinates (those missing b and c) and three unknowns (those missing each a∈A). We expect (and plan to verify computationally) that for every (α,β)∈{±1}^2 at least one of the 8 assignments to the three unknowns avoids the O5 orbit. This settles one‑point amalgamation at size 3 once verified.

Switching: what it does and what it does not
- For ε:V→{±1}, define f^ε(S):=(∏_{v∈S}ε(v))·f(S). Then f^ε encodes another 4‑hypertournament.
- Caution: For a fixed 5‑set X, switching at a vertex v∈X flips the four coordinates of p(X) corresponding to the 4‑sets that contain v and leaves the coordinate “missing v” unchanged. This can change the 5‑type: e.g., (+,-,-,-,-) (an O5 representative) switches at the ‘+’ vertex to (+,+,+,+,+) (a C5 representative). Thus switching is not a valid normalization trick for fixed one‑point data (B,C) in H.

Computational plan (to settle |A|=3 and |A|=4)
- Step A: Compute the O5 orbit via the S5 action above; implement IsO5(p).
- Step B (|A|=3): For each (α,β), enumerate the 8 triples, test IsO5, and record that at least one choice avoids O5.
- Step C (|A|=4): Enumerate compatible (B,C) (both of type C5 or H5, agreeing on f(A)), form p^B_k,p^C_k (k=1..4), and brute‑force the 2^6 choices of x_{ij}, rejecting any assignment for which some Y_k is O5. Record either a counterexample or certify all cases pass.
- Precompute F(α,β)⊆{±1}^3: the allowed triples for a 5‑set with given two fixed coordinates. Then the |A|=4 CSP checks membership of the four triangle‑triples in F(p^B_k,p^C_k).

Constructive ansatz to test
- Try x_{ij}=w_iw_j with w_i:=p^B_i·p^C_i for i∈A. For T={i,j,k} this gives a triple (w_iw_j,w_iw_k,w_jw_k) of product +1. If this never yields O5 for any (p^B_k,p^C_k), it provides a uniform construction for all |A| (worth testing; not proved).
Addendum: explicit S5 action, corrections, and computation plan

1) Explicit ε-formula for the S5 action (implementation aid)
For τ ∈ S5 and i ∈ {1,…,5}, write j := τ^{-1}(i) and define
c_j(τ) := |{k<j : τ(k) > τ(j)}| + |{k>j : τ(k) < τ(j)}|.
Then the sign multiplier in the action p′_i = ε_i(τ)·p_{τ^{-1}(i)} equals
ε_i(τ) = sgn(τ)·(−1)^{c_j(τ)}.
Sketch of justification: Let τ′ be the induced bijection from [5]\{j} to [5]\{i}. Its inversion count is inv(τ′) = inv(τ) − c_j(τ) because the inversions of τ decompose into those not involving j (which biject with the inversions of τ′) and those involving j (counted by c_j). Hence sgn(τ′) = (−1)^{inv(τ′)} = (−1)^{inv(τ)−c_j} = sgn(τ)·(−1)^{c_j}. By definition ε_i(τ) = sgn(τ′). A immediate corollary is the product identity ∏_{i=1}^5 ε_i(τ) = sgn(τ), since Σ_j c_j(τ) = 2·inv(τ).

Practical note: This eliminates ambiguity about ε and supports a robust IsO5 enumerator.

2) Correction to the “fully aligned” claim
The statement “If p^B_k = p^C_k for all k then setting all x_{ij}=δ makes p(Y_k) constant δ for all k” is false unless the common pattern (p^B_k)_{k∈A} is itself constant with value δ. Counterexample: take p^B=p^C=(+,+,−,+) and δ=+. Then for k=3 the fixed coordinates are (−,−) while the three variables are +, so p(Y_3) is not constant. A correct (weaker) statement is: if p^B_k = p^C_k = δ for all k, then x_{ij}≡δ makes every p(Y_k) constant δ, hence non-O5.

3) F(α,β) tables: compute all four cases
Define F(α,β) ⊆ {±1}^3 as the set of triples (x,y,z) for which p=(α,β,x,y,z) is non-O5. Do not assume F(+,+)=F(−,−) or F(+,-)=F(−,+) a priori; compute all four cases. This is an 8×4=32-evaluation task. Record each F(α,β) explicitly along with any observed symmetries (e.g., invariance under permuting x,y,z).

Consequence: |A|=3 reduces to checking that for each (α,β) there exists at least one triple in F(α,β). Archive one such triple per case.

4) |A|=4 CSP protocol (profiles and ansatz)
- Use the already-recorded CSP with variables x_{ij} on the six edges of K4 and four constraints Y_k. For any concrete pair (B,C) over A with B∩C=A and both omitting O5, determine the four pairs (p^B_k,p^C_k) and require the corresponding triangle-triple to lie in F(p^B_k,p^C_k).
- Profiles to test early:
  • P1: p^B≡+, p^C≡+. The corrected alignment lemma (constant case) gives the assignment x_{ij}≡+.
  • P2: p^B≡+, p^C≡−. Try the perfect-matching assignment x_{12}=x_{34}=+, others −; check all four Y_k via IsO5.
  • P3: p^B≡+, p^C drawn from an H5 labeling consistent on A; try ansatz x_{ij}=w_i w_j with w_i=p^B_i p^C_i.
  • P4: both sides H5 aligned on A; by the corrected alignment lemma with δ=+, x_{ij}≡+ works if the common 4-bit pattern on A is constant +.
- Constructive ansatz: x_{ij}:=w_i w_j where w_i:=p^B_i p^C_i. For T={i,j,k}, the triple is (w_i w_j, w_i w_k, w_j w_k) with product +1. Test this uniformly across enumerated cases; if it always avoids O5, it suggests a uniform construction for general |A|.

5) Unit tests for IsO5
- p=(+,+,+,+,+) should classify non-O5; p=(+,−,−,−,−) should classify O5; p=(+,−,+,−,+) should classify non-O5 (H5). Also verify that for a transposition τ, ∏_i p′_i flips sign (product identity) and that orbit membership is invariant under the action.

6) Checklist for the next round
- Implement IsO5 with the ε-formula; report the size of the O5 orbit found by enumeration.
- Compute and list F(α,β) for all four cases; confirm |A|=3.
- Run the |A|=4 CSP on P1–P4 first, then extend to representatives modulo S4 on A; archive satisfying/unsatisfying assignments.
- Report whether the ansatz x_{ij}=w_i w_j succeeds in all tested instances.
Additional clarifications, small lemmas, and symmetry for the 5-vector orbit

1) Semantics of the fixed bits p^B_k and p^C_k (|A|=4)
For B on A∪{b} and k∈A, define p^B_k:=f_B({b}∪(A\{k})). On the 5-set A∪{b}, the 5-vector p has entries p_x=f((A∪{b})\{x}). Thus for k∈A, p^B_k coincides with the coordinate “missing k” of p on A∪{b}: it records whether the increasing 4-tuple on {b}∪(A\{k}) is in R_B. Analogously p^C_k is the coordinate “missing k” of the 5-vector on A∪{c}.

2) Necessary local exclusions in the opposite-fixed case (rigorous justification)
- With (α,β,x,y,z)=(+;−;−,−,−) we obtain the canonical O5 representative; hence this triple is forbidden for (α,β)=(+,-).
- By central symmetry of the O5 orbit (see 4) below), (−;+;+,+,+) is also O5; hence forbidden for (α,β)=(−,+).
These give immediate unit tests for any IsO5 implementation and constraints for F(+,-) and F(−,+).

3) Edge/triangle viewpoint and the structured ansatz
- Place the six variables x_{ij} on the edges of K4 on A. The constraint Y_k uses the triangle on T=A\{k}.
- Structured ansatz: pick w_i∈{±1} on the vertices and set x_{ij}:=w_i w_j. For any triangle {i,j,k}, the triple (w_iw_j,w_iw_k,w_jw_k) has product +1, realizing exactly (+++),(+−−),(−+−),(−−+).

4) Central symmetry of the O5 orbit and a consequence for F(α,β)
There exists τ∈S5, e.g. τ=(13), with ε_i(τ)=−1 for all i (check via Lemma 6: c_j(τ) is even for every j and sgn(τ)=−1). Hence for any 5-vector p, p∈O5 iff −p∈O5. As a consequence, for the local tables F(α,β)⊆{±1}^3 (defined by p=(α,β,x,y,z) non-O5), one has
F(−α,−β) = { (−x,−y,−z) : (x,y,z)∈F(α,β) }.
Therefore it suffices to compute F(+,+) and F(+,-); the other two cases follow by triplewise negation. Do not assume any further symmetries (e.g., permutations of x,y,z or F(+,-)=F(−,+)) without verification.

5) On classifying |A|=4 instances
The constraint at each k depends on the ordered pair (p^B_k,p^C_k)∈{++,−−,+−,−+}. Reduction to the pure eq/opp pattern E={k: p^B_k=p^C_k} is insufficient unless one proves F(+,+)=F(−,−) and F(+,-)=F(−,+). Use the full type-vector in {++,−−,+−,−+}^A. By 4), it is enough to compute and store F(+,+), F(+,-), and infer the other two by negation.

6) Implementation checklist (precise conventions)
- Fix, once and for all, an ordering of the five vertices of each Y_k with the first two positions corresponding to the coordinates “missing c” and “missing b”, respectively, and the last three to the vertices of A\{k} in increasing order. Use the same convention for constructing p=(α,β,x,y,z) when populating F(α,β).
- Implement IsO5 via Lemma 6. Unit tests: (+,+,+,+,+) is non-O5; (+,−,−,−,−) is O5; (+,−,+,−,+) is non-O5. Report the orbit size and verify closure under the action.
- Compute F(+,+), F(+,-); obtain F(−,−), F(−,+) by triplewise negation. Conclude |A|=3 by listing one admissible triple for each (α,β).
- For |A|=4, enumerate realizable type-vectors from actual pairs (B,C) (both C5/H5, agreeing on A), and brute-force 2^6 assignments to x_{ij}. Archive SAT witnesses or UNSAT certificates. Test the ansatz x_{ij}=w_i w_j with w_i=p^B_i p^C_i across the same cases.

These additions lock down the symmetry that underlies Claim N1, correct the eq/opp reduction, and make the forthcoming computations unambiguous and reusable.
Uniform 2+2− assignment and a corrected conditional reduction for |A|=4

Ordering convention for local F-tables
- For any 5-set Y_k={b,c}∪(A\{k}) with A={1,2,3,4} and i<j<ℓ the increasing order on A\{k}, we use the coordinate order
  p(Y_k) = (p_{\text{missing }c}, p_{\text{missing }b}, p_{\text{missing }i}, p_{\text{missing }j}, p_{\text{missing }\ell}).
- With this convention, F(α,β)⊆{±1}^3 is the set of ordered triples (x,y,z) such that (α,β,x,y,z) is non-O5.

Lemma A (2+2 vertex-sign ansatz yields (+−−)-type on every triangle).
- Let w_i∈{±1} (i∈A) have exactly two + and two −, and set x_{ij}:=w_i w_j. For each k, the triple (x,y,z) contributed by the three edges inside A\{k} is, up to permutation of its three coordinates, of the form (+,−,−).
- Proof. If k is from the + vertices, then A\{k} contains {+,−,−}; the pairwise products are (−,−,+). If k is from the − vertices, then A\{k} contains {+, +, −}; the pairwise products are (+,−,−). In either case the unordered triple has one + and two −. The order within (x,y,z) depends on the fixed coordinate convention but is a permutation of (+,−,−). ∎

Corrected conditional reduction for |A|=4
- Conditional Proposition (uniform 2+2 ansatz). Fix the above ordering convention. Suppose that for each (α,β)∈{++, +−, −+, −−}, all three permutations of (+,−,−) lie in F(α,β). Then for every one-point instance over |A|=4 there exists an amalgam D in H obtained by the uniform assignment x_{ij}=w_i w_j with some w having exactly two + and two − on A.
  • Proof. By Lemma A, for every k the ordered triple on Y_k is a permutation of (+,−,−). By hypothesis, this ordered triple is in F(p^B_k,p^C_k) for each k, hence none of the four Y_k is O5, and D∈H. ∎
- Unconditional subcase (equal-constant fixed pairs). If (p^B_k,p^C_k)=(δ,δ) for all k (with δ∈{±1}), then the constant assignment x_{ij}≡δ makes every p(Y_k) equal to (δ,δ,δ,δ,δ), which is ±C5 and therefore non-O5. Hence an amalgam exists in this subcase.

Hard local exclusion in the opposite-fixed case
- For (α,β)=(+,-), the triple (−,−,−) is forbidden: p=(+,-,−,−,−) is the canonical O5 representative. By central symmetry of the S5 action, (+++) is forbidden for (α,β)=(−,+) as well. These serve as unit checks for IsO5 and constraints in populating F.

Notes on earlier claims
- The claim “(+++) is forbidden in F(+,-)” has not been proved. The argument via “flipping one coordinate” is not valid under the S5 signed action. Treat this as a computational check when populating F.

Computational checklist (precise and minimal)
1) Implement IsO5 via Lemma 6; unit tests: (+,+,+,+,+) non-O5; (+,−,−,−,−) O5; (+,−,+,−,+) non-O5. Report the size of the O5 orbit and closure under the action.
2) Compute F(+,+) and F(+,-) completely (8 triples each) under the above ordering; use Corollary 9 to derive F(−,−) and F(−,+) by triplewise negation. Do not assume S3-invariance.
3) Test the 12 memberships: for each (α,β)∈{++, +−, −+, −−}, verify that all three permutations of (+,−,−) lie in F(α,β).
4) If step 3 passes, conclude by the conditional proposition that the |A|=4 one-point step is uniformly solvable by a 2+2 ansatz; with Lemma 2 this yields AP.
5) If step 3 fails, run the 2^6 CSP for the offending type-profile to search for a different satisfying assignment or produce an UNSAT certificate (listing, for each assignment, a Y_k showing O5).

Implementation detail retained: the structured ansatz yields triangle triples of product +1, hence it can never realize (−,+,+) or (−,−,−). Keep this in mind when interpreting F-tables and debugging assignments.
Updates: explicit |A|=3 solution, concrete |A|=4 tests, and a solvable subclass

Coordinate convention reminder (used below)
- For Y_k={b,c}∪(A\{k}) with A={1,2,3,4} and i<j<ℓ the increasing order on A\{k}, we encode
  p(Y_k) = (p_{missing c}, p_{missing b}, p_{missing i}, p_{missing j}, p_{missing ℓ}).
- Mapping of the last three coordinates to edge variables on K4[A]:
  • p_{missing i} = x_{jℓ},  p_{missing j} = x_{iℓ},  p_{missing ℓ} = x_{ij}.

|A|=3 one‑point amalgamation solved (constructive)
- Let A have size 3. For Y=A∪{b,c} write p(Y)=(α,β,x,y,z) in the above order, where α is fixed by B (missing c), β by C (missing b), and x,y,z are the cross 4‑sets. The following choices always avoid O5:
  • (α,β)=(+,+): take (x,y,z)=(+,+,+) → p(Y)=(+,+,+,+,+)=C5.
  • (α,β)=(−,−): take (x,y,z)=(−,−,−) → p(Y)=(−,−,−,−,−)=−C5.
  • (α,β)=(+,-): take (x,y,z)=(+,-,+) → p(Y)=(+,-,+,-,+)=H5.
  • (α,β)=(−,+): take (x,y,z)=(−,+,−) → p(Y)=(−,+,−,+,−)=−H5.
  Hence the one‑point extension over |A|=3 always exists in H.

  • k=1: (x_{23},x_{24},x_{34})=(−,−,+) → p(Y_1)=(p^B_1,p^C_1,−,−,+).
  • k=2: (x_{13},x_{14},x_{34})=(−,−,+) → p(Y_2)=(p^B_2,p^C_2,−,−,+).
  • k=3: (x_{12},x_{14},x_{24})=(+,-,−) → p(Y_3)=(p^B_3,p^C_3,+,−,−).
  • k=4: (x_{12},x_{13},x_{23})=(+,-,−) → p(Y_4)=(p^B_4,p^C_4,+,−,−).
- Profiles to check via IsO5 (the first two coordinates are specialized as follows):
  • P1: p^B≡+, p^C≡+ → test (+,+,−,−,+) and (+,+,+,−,−).
  • P2: p^B≡+, p^C≡− → test (+,−,−,−,+) and (+,−,+,−,−).
  • P3: p^B≡+, p^C=(+,-,+,-) (aligned H5 on A∪{c}) → same two vectors as P2.
A single IsO5 pass on these four vectors settles P1–P3 for the 2+2 ansatz.

A solvable subclass for |A|=4 via a “local H5 witness” pattern
- Prescribe for each k a local triple (x_{jℓ}, x_{iℓ}, x_{ij}) = (α_k, β_k, α_k), where (α_k,β_k)=(p^B_k,p^C_k) and i<j<ℓ enumerate A\{k}.
- Shared‑edge consistency forces:
  • α_1=α_2=α_3=α_4;  β_1=α_3;  β_4=α_2;  β_2=β_3.
- If the given one‑point data (B,C) satisfy these equalities, then for each k we get p(Y_k)=(α_k,β_k,α_k,β_k,α_k), which is ±C5 if α_k=β_k, else ±H5. Hence an amalgam exists for this subclass.

Caveat on the LLL heuristic
- The symmetric LLL condition e·p·(d+1)≤1 with d=3 would require p≤1/(4e)≈0.091. If |{±1}^3\F(α,β)|≤1 then p=1/8≈0.125, which does not meet the symmetric bound. Treat any LLL‑based argument as heuristic unless we deploy a sharper criterion tailored to our dependency graph.

Actionable checklist (minimal computation to unblock |A|=4)
1) Implement IsO5 (Lemma 6), run unit tests, and report the O5 orbit size.
2) Test the four 5‑vectors from P1–P3 above.
3) Compute F(+,+) and F(+,-) fully (8 triples each) under the fixed ordering; obtain the other two by triplewise negation. Archive the tables.
4) If all permutations of (+,−,−) lie in each F(α,β), invoke Proposition 11 (uniform 2+2). Otherwise, brute‑force the 2^6 CSP per realized 4‑type profile and record SAT witnesses or an UNSAT certificate.
New rigorous tools and corrections (to be used going forward)

1) Union‑bound feasibility for the |A|=4 CSP
- Statement. In the |A|=4 CSP with six edge variables x_{ij} and four triangle constraints Y_k, if for each k the local table F(p^B_k,p^C_k) forbids at most one ordered triple (i.e., |{±1}^3\F(p^B_k,p^C_k)| ≤ 1), then there exists a satisfying global assignment.
- Reason. Each forbidden triple for a fixed triangle rules out exactly 2^3 global assignments (the other 3 edges are free). With at most one forbidden triple per triangle, at most 4·2^3=32 of the 64 assignments are excluded. Hence at least 32 assignments remain.
- Consequence. If a small computation confirms |{±1}^3\F(+,+)| ≤ 1 and |{±1}^3\F(+,-)| ≤ 1 (the other two cases follow by triplewise negation; Cor. 9), the |A|=4 step follows immediately without any 6‑variable search.

2) Specialization of the S5 action to the O5 representative (implementation aid)
- For e_O=(+,-,-,-,-) and τ∈S5 with ε(τ)=(ε_1,…,ε_5), let i0:=τ(1). Then the image p′ under the signed action satisfies p′_i = ε_i if i=i0 and p′_i = −ε_i otherwise. Equivalently, p′ is obtained from ε by flipping all coordinates except i0. Thus p∈O5 iff ∃ε∈E:={ε(τ):τ∈S5} and i0 with p_i=−ε_i for i≠i0 and p_{i0}=ε_{i0}.
- Note. This enables a very compact IsO5: precompute E (120 evaluations) and check the 5·|E| candidates.

3) Parity invariant across the four triangles
- For any assignment x_{ij}∈{±1}, the product of the triangle‑products over the four Y_k equals +1. Equivalently, an odd number of triangles cannot have triple product −1. Reason: each x_{ij} appears in exactly two triangle‑products.

4) Distribution of triangle triples under vertex‑sign assignments
- If x_{ij}=w_i w_j with w∈{±1}^A, then on any triangle the triple is either (+++) (when the three w are equal) or a permutation of (+,−,−) (otherwise). In particular: 4+/0− (or 0+/4−) yields four (+++); 3+/1− (or 1+/3−) yields exactly one (+++); 2+/2− yields no (+++) and all four triangles are permutations of (+,−,−).

Corrections to prior claims
- False: “If T_B=C5 then (p^B_k)_{k∈A} is constant; if T_B=H5 then it is 2+2.” Counterexample: for a C5 5‑set, the 5‑vector equals ε(τ) for some τ; e.g., τ=(12) gives ε=(+,+,−,−,−), which is not constant on A. Do not use this classification to prune cases.
- Unproved (and currently unknown): (+++)∉F(+,-). The argument that tried to force this from Lemma 8 incorrectly treats the free index i0. We keep only the rigorously proved exclusion (---)∉F(+,-) (output.md Lemma 13). The status of (+++) in F(+,-) must be decided computationally.

Coordinate convention (reminder)
- For Y_k={b,c}∪(A\{k}) with A={1,2,3,4} and i<j<ℓ the increasing order on A\{k}, we encode p(Y_k)=(p_{missing c}, p_{missing b}, p_{missing i}, p_{missing j}, p_{missing ℓ}), with p_{missing i}=x_{jℓ}, p_{missing j}=x_{iℓ}, p_{missing ℓ}=x_{ij}.

Actionable checklist (minimal computation to unblock |A|=4)
- Implement IsO5 using Lemma 6; validate unit tests: (+,+,+,+,+) ∉O5; (+,−,−,−,−) ∈O5; (+,−,+,−,+) ∉O5. Also verify the sample ε(τ) values listed in prior notes.
- Compute F(+,+) and F(+,-) completely (8 triples each) under the fixed coordinate order; derive F(−,−), F(−,+) by triplewise negation. Report sizes and explicit complements.
- If both complements have size ≤1, conclude |A|=4 by the union‑bound lemma and hence AP via Lemma 2. If, stronger, both F tables are exactly “triple product +1,” record the uniform construction x_{ij}=w_i w_j and close.
- If not, test whether all permutations of (+,−,−) lie in F(+,+) and F(+,-); if yes, apply Proposition 11 (uniform 2+2). Otherwise brute‑force the 2^6 CSP on the realized profiles, using the parity invariant to prune, and archive SAT/UNSAT witnesses.
O5 membership: exact S‑criterion vs. ε‑only heuristics
- Exact criterion (to be used for IsO5). Let e_O=(+,-,-,-,-), and define the pair‑set
  S := { (ε(τ), i0=τ(1)) : τ ∈ S_5 },
  where ε(τ) is as in Lemma 6. Then for p∈{±1}^5,
  p ∈ O5 ⇔ ∃(ε,i0)∈S such that p_i = ε_i for i=i0 and p_i = −ε_i for i≠i0.
  Equivalently, p is obtained from ε by “flipping all coordinates except i0,” with (ε,i0) realized by the same τ. This is the specialization of the action to e_O and is both necessary and sufficient.

- ε‑only heuristics (use with caution). Two convenient tests are often useful but are not sufficient on their own:
  • Hamming‑1: Hamming(−p, ε) = 1 for some ε ∈ E := {ε(τ) : τ∈S_5}.
  • Inner‑product −3: Σ_i p_i ε_i = −3 for some ε∈E (equivalently to Hamming‑1).
  These conditions are necessary for O5 membership but not sufficient unless the unique discrepancy index i0 is consistent with i0=τ(1) for the same τ realizing ε. Hence, they can give false positives. Always validate by checking the pair (ε,i0)∈S.

ε‑cocycle and generators (implementation aids)
- Cocycle identity. For σ,τ∈S_5 and i∈[5]:
  ε_i(σ∘τ) = ε_i(σ) · ε_{σ^{-1}(i)}(τ).
  This follows by composing the signed actions (Lemma 6) and comparing with the action of σ∘τ.

- Adjacent transpositions. For s_k=(k k+1) (k=1,2,3,4),
  ε(s_k) has + at positions k and k+1 and − elsewhere.
  This is a direct computation from Lemma 6 via the c_j counts and is a robust generator datum for building E and S by BFS on the Cayley graph of S_5.

Practical S‑oracle blueprint
- Build S by BFS over right‑multiplication by s_k, storing for each state (τ) the pair (ε(τ), i0=τ(1)). Update via the cocycle and track i0′=τ(s_k(1)). Verify: |S|=120; sample ε values on generators; product identity ∏_i ε_i(τ)=sgn(τ) (Cor. 7).
- IsO5(p): return true iff ∃(ε,i0)∈S with p_i=ε_i for i=i0 and p_i=−ε_i otherwise.

Local F‑tables and the |A|=4 plan
- Compute F(+,+) and F(+,-) by 8 exact IsO5 calls each on p=(α,β,x,y,z) under the fixed coordinate order (reminder in output.md). Derive F(−,−) and F(−,+) by triplewise negation (Cor. 9). Confirm the |A|=3 witnesses (Proposition 14) show up as allowed entries in the appropriate tables.
- Decision routes:
  • If |{±1}^3\F(+,+)| ≤ 1 and |{±1}^3\F(+,-)| ≤ 1, conclude |A|=4 by Cor. 16.1.
  • If, stronger, all three permutations of (+,−,−) lie in F(+,+) and F(+,-), conclude by Proposition 11 (uniform 2+2).
  • Otherwise, run the 2^6 CSP per realized profile, pruning by the parity invariant (Lemma 17).

Unit checks for the oracle
- Mandatory: (+,−,−,−,−) ∈ O5; (+,+,+,+,+) ∉ O5; (+,−,+,−,+) ∉ O5. Also verify ε(s_k) as above and closure properties from Lemma 6/Cor. 7.

Caveat
- Do not treat “ε only” rules (Hamming‑1 or inner‑product −3) as definitive. They are helpful filters but must be validated against the S‑pair constraint to avoid false positives.

Proposition 1 (Orientation function model).
For a finite set V, giving a 4‑hypertournament structure (V,R) satisfying: (i) all tuples in R have distinct entries; (ii) R is closed under even permutations of coordinates; (iii) for every 4‑tuple of distinct vertices (x1,x2,x3,x4), exactly one of (x1,x2,x3,x4) and (x2,x1,x3,x4) lies in R; is equivalent to giving an arbitrary function f:[V]^4→{±1}.
Proof. Given f, declare (x1,x2,x3,x4)∈R iff the permutation from the increasing ordering of S={x1,x2,x3,x4} to (x1,…,x4) has sign equal to f(S). This satisfies (i)–(iii) by construction. Conversely, given R with (i)–(iii), fix any 4‑set S and any increasing ordering s of S. By (iii), exactly one of s and its swap lies in R; define f(S)=+1 if s∈R and f(S)=−1 otherwise. By (ii) and (iii), membership of any ordered tuple from S depends only on the parity relative to s, so f is well defined and recovers R. ∎

Lemma 2 (One‑point amalgamation suffices for AP in H).
Let H be the class of finite 4‑hypertournaments omitting O5. Suppose that whenever A∈H and B=A∪{b}∈H and C=A∪{c}∈H with B∩C=A, there exists D∈H on A∪{b,c} extending both B and C. Then H has the amalgamation property.
Proof. Given B0,B1∈H over A, enumerate C\A as c1,…,ck and set A0:=A. Inductively, amalgamate Bi with Ai∪{ci} over Ai to obtain Bi+1 on Ai+1:=Ai∪{ci}. At each step, by hypothesis, all 5‑sets involving the new vertex ci avoid O5, and previously constructed parts are unchanged. After k steps we obtain an amalgam D∈H of B0 and C over A. ∎

Proposition 3 (CSP formulation of the |A|=4 one‑point step).
Let A={1,2,3,4}, b, c new. Given B on A∪{b} and C on A∪{c} in H that agree on A, any amalgam D on A∪{b,c} is determined on new 4‑sets by the six values x_{ij}:=f({i,j,b,c}) (1≤i<j≤4). The only new 5‑sets are Y_k:={b,c}∪(A\{k}) for k=1,2,3,4. Writing p^B_k:=f_B({b}∪(A\{k})) and p^C_k:=f_C({c}∪(A\{k})), the 5‑vector p(Y_k) has two fixed coordinates (missing c gives p^B_k; missing b gives p^C_k) and three coordinates equal to the x_{ij} for {i,j}⊂A\{k}. D∈H iff for each k, p(Y_k) is not in the O5 orbit.
Proof. All 4‑sets contained in B or C are already fixed. The only 4‑sets not contained in B or C are precisely the six X_{ij}={i,j,b,c}. The only new 5‑subsets of A∪{b,c} (relative to B and C) are those that contain both b and c; there are exactly four, the Y_k. Their p‑vectors depend on the listed values. Avoidance of O5 on all 5‑sets is thus equivalent to the stated four constraints. ∎

Corollary 4 (Trivial one‑point cases |A|≤2).
If |A|≤2, then one‑point amalgamation always succeeds in H.
Proof. When |A|≤2 there are no 3‑subsets of A, hence no 5‑sets of the form {b,c}∪T with T⊂A of size 3. Thus there are no new 5‑set constraints; any assignment to cross 4‑sets yields an amalgam in H. ∎

Fact 5 (Switching yields a 4‑hypertournament but may change 5‑types).
For ε:V→{±1}, define f^ε(S):=(∏_{v∈S}ε(v))·f(S). Then f^ε encodes a 4‑hypertournament. However, for a fixed 5‑set X, switching at v∈X flips the four coordinates of p(X) corresponding to 4‑sets containing v and leaves the coordinate “missing v” unchanged; this can change the isomorphism type on X (e.g., an O5 representative (+,-,-,-,-) switches at its ‘+’ vertex to (+,+,+,+,+), a C5 representative). ∎
Lemma 6 (Explicit formula for the S5 action on 5-vectors).
Let X be a 5-set equipped with an increasing labeling {1,2,3,4,5}. For τ∈S5 and i∈{1,…,5}, write j:=τ^{-1}(i) and define
c_j(τ) := |{k<j : τ(k) > τ(j)}| + |{k>j : τ(k) < τ(j)}|.
In the isomorphism action on p∈{±1}^X given by p′_i = ε_i(τ)·p_{τ^{-1}(i)}, the sign factor is
ε_i(τ) = sgn(τ)·(−1)^{c_j(τ)}.

Proof. Let τ′ be the induced bijection from [5]\{j} to [5]\{i}, obtained by deleting position j in the domain and value i in the codomain. By definition, ε_i(τ)=sgn(τ′). The inversions of τ split into two disjoint families: those not involving j (which correspond bijectively to inversions of τ′) and those involving j, whose number is c_j(τ) by definition. Hence inv(τ)=inv(τ′)+c_j(τ), so sgn(τ)= (−1)^{inv(τ)} = (−1)^{inv(τ′)+c_j(τ)} = sgn(τ′)·(−1)^{c_j(τ)} = ε_i(τ)·(−1)^{c_j(τ)}. Rearranging gives the claimed formula. ∎

Corollary 7 (Product identity for ε-factors).
For τ∈S5, one has ∏_{i=1}^5 ε_i(τ) = sgn(τ).

Proof. Using ε_i(τ) = sgn(τ)·(−1)^{c_{τ^{-1}(i)}(τ)} and the fact that each inversion contributes 1 to c_a and 1 to c_b, we have Σ_{j=1}^5 c_j(τ) = 2·inv(τ). Therefore ∏_{i=1}^5 ε_i(τ) = sgn(τ)^5 · (−1)^{Σ_j c_j(τ)} = sgn(τ)·(−1)^{2·inv(τ)} = sgn(τ). ∎
Lemma 8 (Central symmetry of the O5 orbit).
There exists τ∈S5 with ε_i(τ)=−1 for all i. In particular, for any 5-vector p one has p∈O5 if and only if −p∈O5. Thus the O5 orbit is closed under global sign reversal.

Proof. Take τ=(13) in one-line notation [3,2,1,4,5]. By Lemma 6, for j:=τ^{-1}(i), ε_i(τ)=sgn(τ)·(−1)^{c_j(τ)}. A direct count gives c_1(τ)=c_2(τ)=c_3(τ)=2 and c_4(τ)=c_5(τ)=0, so c_j(τ) is even for all j. Since sgn(τ)=−1, we get ε_i(τ)=−1 for every i. If q is in the O5 orbit, then so is R_τ(q)=−q∘τ^{−1}. As σ ranges over S5, the set {−R_σ(e1)} equals {R_{τσ}(e1):σ∈S5}, hence −O5=O5. ∎

Corollary 9 (Sign-flip symmetry for local tables F).
For F(α,β)⊆{±1}^3 defined by: (x,y,z)∈F(α,β) iff (α,β,x,y,z) is non-O5, one has
F(−α,−β) = { (−x,−y,−z) : (x,y,z)∈F(α,β) }.

Proof. (α,β,x,y,z) is non-O5 iff its global negation (−α,−β,−x,−y,−z) is non-O5 by Lemma 8. This is exactly the stated correspondence. ∎
Lemma 10 (2+2 vertex signs induce (+−−)-type on every triangle).
Let A={1,2,3,4} and choose w_i∈{±1} with exactly two plus and two minus. Define x_{ij}:=w_i w_j for 1≤i<j≤4. For each k∈A, on the triangle induced by A\{k} the ordered triple of edge-variables (x,y,z) (in any fixed coordinate convention) is a permutation of (+,−,−).

Proof. If k is one of the + vertices, then A\{k} contains one + and two −; the three pairwise products are (−,−,+). If k is one of the − vertices, then A\{k} contains two + and one −; the three pairwise products are (+,−,−). Thus in either case the unordered triple has signs {+ , − , −}. The ordering of (x,y,z) depends on the fixed convention but is a permutation of (+,−,−). ∎

Proposition 11 (Conditional |A|=4 amalgamation via a uniform 2+2 ansatz).
Fix a consistent ordering convention for the last three coordinates in the definition of F(α,β) (e.g., by increasing order of the three vertices in A\{k}). Suppose that for each (α,β)∈{++, +−, −+, −−}, all three permutations of (+,−,−) belong to F(α,β). Then for every one-point diagram over |A|=4 there exists an amalgam D∈H obtained by setting x_{ij}=w_i w_j for some choice of w with exactly two + and two − on A.

Proof. Choose any w with exactly two + and two − on A and set x_{ij}=w_i w_j. By Lemma 10, for each k the ordered triple contributed by the three edges in A\{k} is a permutation of (+,−,−). By hypothesis, this ordered triple lies in F(p^B_k,p^C_k) for every k, so no Y_k is of type O5. Therefore the resulting structure on A∪{b,c} is in H and extends both B and C. ∎

Proposition 12 (Equal-constant fixed pairs are solvable by a constant assignment).
In the |A|=4 one-point amalgamation problem, if (p^B_k,p^C_k)=(δ,δ) for all k∈A with a fixed δ∈{±1}, then there exists an amalgam D∈H obtained by setting x_{ij}≡δ.

Proof. With this assignment, for each k the 5-vector p(Y_k) equals (δ,δ,δ,δ,δ), which is ±C5. Since ±C5 is not in the O5 orbit, each Y_k is non-O5 and the amalgam lies in H. ∎

Lemma 13 (A hard local exclusion in the opposite-fixed case).
For (α,β)=(+,-), the triple (−,−,−) is forbidden: (x,y,z)=(−,−,−)∉F(+,-). Symmetrically, for (α,β)=(−,+), (+++)∉F(−,+).

Proof. For (α,β)=(+,-) and (x,y,z)=(−,−,−) one has p=(+,-,−,−,−), which is the canonical O5 representative; hence it is in the O5 orbit. By Lemma 8 (global sign-reversal is in the orbit), (−,+,+,+,+) is also in O5, yielding the symmetric statement. ∎
Proposition 14 (The one-point amalgamation over |A|=3 always succeeds, constructively).
Let A have size 3 and let B=A∪{b} and C=A∪{c} lie in H and agree on A. On Y:=A∪{b,c}, write p(Y)=(α,β,x,y,z) in the coordinate order (missing c, missing b, then missing the elements of A in increasing order). Then for each (α,β)∈{±1}^2 there is a choice of (x,y,z)∈{±1}^3 such that p(Y) is not in the O5 orbit, namely:
- If (α,β)=(+,+), take (x,y,z)=(+,+,+), so p(Y)=(+,+,+,+,+)=C5.
- If (α,β)=(−,−), take (x,y,z)=(−,−,−), so p(Y)=(−,−,−,−,−)=−C5.
- If (α,β)=(+,-), take (x,y,z)=(+,-,+), so p(Y)=(+,-,+,-,+)=H5.
- If (α,β)=(−,+), take (x,y,z)=(−,+,−), so p(Y)=(−,+,−,+,−)=−H5.
In all cases Y is non‑O5, hence there exists an amalgam D∈H on A∪{b,c} extending B and C.

Proof. The only new 5‑set is Y=A∪{b,c}. The displayed assignments set its 5‑vector equal to one of ±C5 or ±H5 in the fixed coordinate order, and these are not in the O5 orbit. There are no other new 5‑sets to check. Hence the extension lies in H. ∎

Proposition 15 (A solvable subclass for |A|=4 via a local H5 pattern with consistency).
Let A={1,2,3,4}, and let B=A∪{b} and C=A∪{c} lie in H and agree on A. For k∈A, write (α_k,β_k):=(p^B_k,p^C_k). Adopt the coordinate order
p(Y_k)=(p_{missing c},p_{missing b},p_{missing i},p_{missing j},p_{missing ℓ}) for Y_k={b,c}∪(A\{k}) with i<j<ℓ the increasing order on A\{k}. Suppose the type‑data satisfy the equalities
α_1=α_2=α_3=α_4,
β_1=α_3,
β_4=α_2,
β_2=β_3.
Then there exists an assignment to the six cross 4‑sets x_{ij}=f({i,j,b,c}) such that, for each k, p(Y_k) is ±C5 if α_k=β_k and ±H5 otherwise. In particular, an amalgam D∈H exists.

Proof. Define the triple of edge variables on Y_k by (x_{jℓ},x_{iℓ},x_{ij})=(α_k,β_k,α_k), where {i,j,ℓ}=A\{k} with i<j<ℓ. Each edge variable x_{ij} appears in exactly two such triples, corresponding to the two values of k∈A\{i,j}. The displayed equalities on the α_k and β_k are exactly those required to make these two prescriptions agree for every edge (a direct check using the mapping p_{missing i}=x_{jℓ}, p_{missing j}=x_{iℓ}, p_{missing ℓ}=x_{ij}). With this consistent assignment, p(Y_k)=(α_k,β_k,α_k,β_k,α_k), which is ±C5 if α_k=β_k and ±H5 otherwise. None of these are in the O5 orbit, so all four Y_k are non‑O5 and the resulting structure is an amalgam in H. ∎
Lemma 16 (Union‑bound feasibility for the |A|=4 CSP).
In the |A|=4 one‑point CSP (Proposition 3), suppose that for each k∈{1,2,3,4} the local table forbids at most one ordered triple, i.e., |{±1}^3\F(p^B_k,p^C_k)| ≤ 1. Then there exists an assignment to the six variables x_{ij} that satisfies all four constraints (so an amalgam in H exists).

Proof. There are 2^6=64 global assignments to the six variables. Fix k and a forbidden ordered triple t on its three local variables; the set of global assignments inducing t on that triangle has size 2^3 (the other three edge‑variables are free). Thus forbidding at most one triple per triangle eliminates at most 4·2^3=32 global assignments in total. Therefore at least 64−32=32 assignments remain that satisfy all four local constraints. ∎

Corollary 16.1 (A small‑table criterion for the |A|=4 step).
If the two base tables satisfy |{±1}^3\F(+,+)| ≤ 1 and |{±1}^3\F(+,-)| ≤ 1 (so, by Corollary 9, the same holds for F(−,−) and F(−,+) by triplewise negation), then for every one‑point diagram over |A|=4 there exists an amalgam D∈H.

Proof. For any instance, each Y_k uses one of the four pairs (p^B_k,p^C_k)∈{++,−−,+−,−+}; by the stated hypothesis and Corollary 9, each corresponding table forbids at most one triple. Apply Lemma 16. ∎

Lemma 17 (Global parity constraint across the four triangles).
In the |A|=4 CSP, for any assignment x_{ij}∈{±1}, the product of the triangle‑products over the four Y_k equals +1. Equivalently, an odd number of triangles cannot have triple‑product −1.

Proof. Each triangle‑product equals the product of its three edge‑variables. Multiplying the four triangle‑products together, each edge‑variable x_{ij} appears exactly twice (in the two triangles omitting i and j), hence contributes x_{ij}^2=1 to the total product. Therefore the total product is +1. ∎
Lemma 18 (ε‑cocycle for composition).
For σ,τ∈S_5 and i∈{1,2,3,4,5}, one has
ε_i(σ∘τ) = ε_i(σ) · ε_{σ^{-1}(i)}(τ).

Proof. Let A_ρ denote the signed action from Lemma 6: (A_ρ p)_i = ε_i(ρ) · p_{ρ^{-1}(i)}. Then (A_σ A_τ p)_i = ε_i(σ) · (A_τ p)_{σ^{-1}(i)} = ε_i(σ) · ε_{σ^{-1}(i)}(τ) · p_{τ^{-1}(σ^{-1}(i))}. On the other hand, A_{σ∘τ} p has i‑th coordinate ε_i(σ∘τ) · p_{(σ∘τ)^{-1}(i)}. Uniqueness of the action implies ε_i(σ∘τ) = ε_i(σ) · ε_{σ^{-1}(i)}(τ). ∎

Lemma 19 (ε for adjacent transpositions).
For s_k=(k k+1) with k∈{1,2,3,4}, the vector ε(s_k) has entries + at positions k and k+1 and − at the other three positions.

Proof. Write τ:=s_k. Using Lemma 6, ε_i(τ)=sgn(τ)·(−1)^{c_j(τ)} for j=τ^{-1}(i). A direct count shows that c_j(τ) is odd for j∉{k,k+1} and even for j∈{k,k+1}. Since sgn(τ)=−1, this yields ε_i(τ)=−1 at i∉{k,k+1} and ε_i(τ)=+1 at i∈{k,k+1}. ∎

Lemma 20 (O5‑image formula and exact pair‑set membership test).
Let e_O=(+,-,-,-,-). Define the pair‑set S:={ (ε(τ), i0=τ(1)) : τ∈S_5 }. For p∈{±1}^5, the following are equivalent:
(a) p lies in the O5 orbit (i.e., p = A_τ(e_O) for some τ∈S_5).
(b) There exists (ε,i0)∈S such that p_i=ε_i for i=i0 and p_i=−ε_i for i≠i0.
Equivalently, p is obtained from ε by flipping all coordinates except i0, with (ε,i0) realized by the same τ.

Proof. For (a)⇒(b): If p=A_τ(e_O), then for i with τ^{-1}(i)=1 one has p_i=ε_i(τ)·(+)=ε_i(τ), and for i with τ^{-1}(i)≠1 one has p_i=ε_i(τ)·(−)=−ε_i(τ). Writing i0:=τ(1) gives (b). For (b)⇒(a): Given (ε,i0)∈S, pick τ with ε(τ)=ε and τ(1)=i0. The same computation shows A_τ(e_O)=p. ∎
