The S‑based O5 membership test is now rigorous (output.md Lemma 20), as are the ε‑cocycle and generator data (Lemmas 18–19). The remaining bottleneck is to populate the two base tables F(+,+) and F(+,-) and then close |A|=4 either by the 2+2 ansatz (Prop. 11) or by a tiny brute force, if needed.\\n\\nNew rigor: S5 actions that preserve the (α,β) table and their effect on triples\\n- Notation and convention: We use the fixed coordinate order for p(Y_k) recorded in output.md: (missing c, missing b, then the three positions missing i<j<ℓ from A\\\\{k}). For the local table F(α,β), membership is: (x,y,z)∈F(α,β) ⇔ (α,β,x,y,z) is non‑O5.\\n\\nLemma 21 (swap of the fixed coordinates enforces central symmetry at α=β).\\n- Statement. For all α,β and (x,y,z), one has\\n  (x,y,z)∈F(α,β) ⇔ (−x,−y,−z)∈F(β,α).\\n  In particular, if α=β, then F(α,α) is centrally symmetric: (x,y,z)∈F(α,α) ⇔ (−x,−y,−z)∈F(α,α).\\n- Proof. Apply τ=(12). By Lemma 19, ε(τ)=(+,+,−,−,−). The action A_τ swaps the first two coordinates and flips signs on the last three: A_τ(α,β,x,y,z)=(β,α,−x,−y,−z). O5‑membership is invariant under A_τ; hence (α,β,x,y,z) is non‑O5 ⇔ (β,α,−x,−y,−z) is non‑O5. This is exactly the claim.∎\\n- Use: reduces F(+,+) to four unordered pairs of opposite triples, and relates F(+,-) to F(−,+) (though we already have Cor. 9 for global sign flip).\\n\\nLemma 22 (two internal generators acting on last three coordinates while preserving (α,β)).\\n- Statements. For all α,β and all (x,y,z), one has the equivalences within the same table F(α,β):\\n  (S3) (x,y,z)∈F(α,β) ⇔ (−y,−x,z)∈F(α,β).\\n  (S4) (x,y,z)∈F(α,β) ⇔ (x,−z,−y)∈F(α,β).\\n- Proof. For S3 use τ=(34). Lemma 19 gives ε(τ)=(−,−,+,+,−). Then A_τ(α,β,x,y,z)= (−α,−β, y, x, −z). By Cor. 9 (global sign symmetry), (−α,−β, y, x, −z) is non‑O5 iff (α,β, −y, −x, z) is non‑O5. This yields S3. For S4 use τ=(45) with ε(τ)=(−,−,−,+,+), giving A_τ(α,β,x,y,z)=(−α,−β, −x, z, y). Applying Cor. 9 again gives (α,β, x, −z, −y), i.e., S4.∎\\n- Use: S3 and S4 generate a small group of transformations on triples inside a fixed table F(α,β) that preserve triple‑product and relate many ordered patterns without touching α,β.\\n\\nLemma 23 (a coordinate swap on triples that preserves (α,β)).\\n- Statement. For all α,β and all (x,y,z), one has (x,y,z)∈F(α,β) ⇔ (z,y,x)∈F(α,β).\\n- Proof. Combine S4, then S3, then S4 again. Starting with (x,y,z), S4 gives (x,−z,−y); S3 then gives (z,y,−x); S4 again gives (z,y,x). Each step preserves membership in F(α,β), hence the equivalence.∎\\n- Use: F(α,β) is invariant under swapping the first and third triple coordinates, a key reduction for the 2+2 ansatz.\\n\\nConsequences for orbits of {±1}^3 under these internal symmetries\\n- The group generated by S3, S4, and the swap (x,y,z)↔(z,y,x) (Lemma 23) preserves triple‑product and partitions {±1}^3 into the following orbits:\\n  • Product +1: O+_A = { (+++), (+−−), (−−+) } and O+_B = { (−+−) }.\\n  • Product −1: O−_A = { (−−−), (++−), (−++) } and O−_B = { (+−+) }.\\n  The equivalences S3/S4 connect the two 3‑element orbits (within each parity) and leave the 1‑element orbits fixed; Lemma 23 allows us to permute x and z, ensuring (+−−) and (−−+) are interchangeable inside F(α,β).\\n- Reduction of F‑table workload: To determine F(α,β) completely, it suffices to test at most four representatives: (+++), (+−−), (−−−), (+−+). The remaining 4 triples follow by the above orbit relations and Lemma 21 when α=β (central symmetry).\\n\\nRefined implications for the 2+2 vertex‑sign ansatz (Prop. 11)\\n- Under the fixed coordinate convention (output.md), the 2+2 vertex‑sign ansatz (Lemma 10) produces, for any choice of the two “+” vertices on A, on each triangle an ordered triple that is either (+,−,−) or (−,−,+). The permutation (−,+,−) never occurs under this ansatz.\\n- By Lemma 23 (x↔z swap) the two realized permutations are equivalent inside any fixed F(α,β). Therefore, for Prop. 11 it suffices to check a single representative:\\n  • Decisive checks: (+,−,−)∈F(+,+) and (+,−,−)∈F(+,-).\\n  If both hold, then by Lemma 23 the other realized permutation (−,−,+) also lies in F, and Prop. 11 yields a uniform |A|=4 solution, hence AP (via Lemma 2). By Cor. 9, the remaining two cases (−,−) and (−,+) follow by triplewise negation.\\n- This sharpens and justifies the “two‑checks suffice” reduction proposed earlier (now with full proofs relying on S3/S4/Lemma 23). Note this is weaker than assuming all three permutations of (+,−,−) are present; the ansatz never requires (−,+,−).\\n\\nConcrete micro‑tests and minimal computation plan (auditable)\\n- Unit tests for the new symmetries (to sanity‑check the IsO5 implementation and the F‑tables):\\n  1) Verify S3/S4 on sample inputs: For a random (α,β) and triple t, confirm IsO5(α,β,t) equals IsO5(α,β,−y,−x,z) and IsO5(α,β,x,−z,−y).\\n  2) Verify Lemma 23: IsO5(α,β,x,y,z)=IsO5(α,β,z,y,x).\\n  3) Verify Lemma 21: IsO5(α,β,x,y,z)=IsO5(β,α,−x,−y,−z).\\n- Minimal decisive F‑entries to evaluate with the S‑oracle (output.md Lemma 20):\\n  • For F(+,+): check (+,−,−). (+++) is known allowed (Prop. 14 for |A|=3; also C5), so (−,−,−) follows by Lemma 21.\\n  • For F(+,-): check (+,−,−) and retain that (+,−,+) is allowed (Prop. 14). (−,−,−) is forbidden (Lemma 13).\\n  Derive the remaining two base tables by Cor. 9. Using Lemma 23, if (+,−,−) is allowed in a table, (−,−,+) is automatically allowed too.\\n- Four pre‑existing decisive 5‑vector tests (still recommended):\\n  • For F(+,+): (+,+,+,−,−) and (+,+,−,−,+) (the two realized permutations under w=(+,+,−,−)).\\n  • For F(+,-): (+,−,+,−,−) and (+,−,−,−,+).\\n  Each should be non‑O5 for the 2+2 ansatz to succeed on the corresponding profiles.\\n\\nExamples and sanity data already fixed by output.md\\n- F(+,+) contains (+++) and, by Lemma 21, also (−−−).\\n- F(+,-) contains (+,−,+) (Prop. 14) and forbids (−−−) (Lemma 13). The status of (+++) in F(+,-) remains to be decided by the S‑oracle (do not assume).\\n\\nWhy this is incremental, auditable progress\\n- New, fully rigorous lemmas (21–23) extract symmetry directly from the S5 action (using only Lemmas 6, 8, 19) and sharply reduce the local enumeration:\\n  • Per base table, at most four representatives need evaluation to reconstruct all 8 entries.\\n  • For the 2+2 ansatz, only two total tests are decisive: (+,−,−)∈F(+,+) and (+,−,−)∈F(+,-).\\n- These are immediately testable with the existing S‑oracle plan (output.md Lemma 20). They also supply strong unit tests to validate an implementation.\\n\\nObstacles and open items\\n- An analytic (non‑computational) classification of S remains difficult; we therefore continue to rely on the small enumeration via the S‑oracle. The new symmetries minimize the number of required queries.\\n- If either of the two decisive checks fails, the uniform 2+2 construction (Prop. 11) is unavailable. The fallback remains the tiny 2^6 CSP search with parity pruning (output.md Lemma 17) or the specific solvable subclass (Prop. 15).\\n\\nGaps or clarifications for output.md (do not edit now; for later integration)\\n- Adding Lemmas 21–23 would be valuable: they formalize the internal invariances that reduce F‑table computation and justify the “two‑checks suffice” reduction for Prop. 11.\\n- When the F‑tables are eventually archived, include a note that they are invariant under the transforms S3, S4, and x↔z, and that F(α,α) is centrally symmetric (Lemma 21), to aid reproducibility and debugging.\\n\\nNext steps for the verifier (minimal, decisive)\\n1) Implement/validate the S‑oracle IsO5 (output.md Lemma 20). Run the unit tests in output.md and the symmetry checks listed above (S3/S4/Lemma 23/Lemma 21).\\n2) Evaluate the two decisive entries: (+,−,−) in F(+,+) and in F(+,-). If both pass, conclude |A|=4 via Prop. 11 and AP via Lemma 2.\\n3) If needed, populate the full F(+,+), F(+,-) using only the four representatives (+++), (+−−), (−−−), (+−+) and derive all entries by the proved symmetries. Cross‑check against the four P1–P3 vectors.\\n4) If Prop. 11 fails, run the small 2^6 search with parity pruning and archive either SAT witnesses or a minimal UNSAT certificate (which would refute AP).\"}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"auto","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"ProverOutput","schema_":{"properties":{"progress_md":{"description":"Append-only progress notes","title":"Progress Md","type":"string"}},"required":["progress_md"],"title":"ProverOutput","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":46474,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":19036,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":16192},"total_tokens":65510},"user":null,"store":true}
