{"progress_md":"Status and aim\n- We keep the one‑point reduction and the |A|=4 six‑variable CSP (output.md Prop. 3). The exact O5 membership test via the pair‑set S (output.md Lemma 20), the ε‑cocycle (Lemma 18), and ε on generators (Lemma 19) are now in output.md and are sufficient to implement a correct IsO5.\n- Remaining blocker: populate the two base local tables F(+,+) and F(+,-), then conclude |A|=4 either by the 2+2 construction (Prop. 11, conditional) or a tiny brute‑force/backtracking run.\n\nNew small, rigorous facts (auditable)\n1) Product‑of‑entries identity for O5 (debug/check aid).\n- Claim. If p∈O5 with witness τ in Lemma 20 (i.e., p=A_τ(e_O)), then ∏_{i=1}^5 p_i = sgn(τ).\n- Proof. Writing p=flip_all_but_one(ε(τ), i0=τ(1)), we have ∏ p_i = ε_{i0}·∏_{i≠i0}(−ε_i) = (−1)^4∏_i ε_i = ∏_i ε_i = sgn(τ) by Corollary 7.∎\n- Why useful: A quick invariant to sanity‑check an S‑oracle and any hand‑computed witnesses.\n\n2) A concrete forbidden ordered triple in F(+,-).\n- Lemma EX1. For (α,β)=(+,-), the ordered triple (x,y,z)=(+,+,−) is forbidden, i.e., ( +, −, +, +, − ) ∈ O5.\n- Proof. Take τ=(12)(34), which is even; by direct computation (already in notes and rechecked here) ε(τ)=(−,−,−,−,+) and i0=τ(1)=2. Lemma 20 then gives p=A_τ(e_O)=flip_all_but_one(ε,2)=(+,−,+,+,−). Hence (x,y,z)=(+,+,−) is not in F(+,-).∎\n- Why useful: This gives a certified entry of F(+,-) without any enumeration. It also provides a unit test for IsO5.\n\nExplicit ε and (ε,i0) samples (for S‑oracle validation)\n- τ=id: ε=(+,+,+,+,+), i0=1; ∏ε=+.\n- τ=(12): ε=(+,+,−,−,−), i0=2; ∏ε=−.\n- τ=(23): ε=(−,+,+,−,−), i0=1; ∏ε=−.\n- τ=(34): ε=(−,−,+,+,−), i0=1; ∏ε=−.\n- τ=(45): ε=(−,−,−,+,+), i0=1; ∏ε=−.\n- τ=(12)(34): ε=(−,−,−,−,+), i0=2; ∏ε=+.\n- τ=(123): ε=(+,−,−,+,+), i0=2; ∏ε=+.\n- τ=(234): ε=(+,+,−,−,+), i0=1; ∏ε=+.\n- τ=(345): ε=(+,+,+,−,−), i0=1; ∏ε=+.\nThese pairs should appear in S; they are also useful check‑points when debugging the cocycle BFS.\n\n2+2 ansatz: precise permutation usage and a weaker feasibility reduction\n- Reminder (output.md Lemma 10): with w having two + and two − and x_{ij}=w_iw_j, every triangle‑triple is a permutation of (+,−,−). Under our fixed coordinate order, for the concrete choice w=(+,+,−,−) on A={1,2,3,4}, one checks explicitly (as already used in notes) that:\n  • Y_1,Y_2 realize the ordered shape (−,−,+); Y_3,Y_4 realize (+,−,−).\n- Consequently, a weaker conditional than Prop. 11 suffices in practice:\n  • If for every realized pair type (α_k,β_k), both ordered shapes (+,−,−) and (−,−,+) are in F(α_k,β_k), then choosing w so that the two “+” are placed on the two indices k where the (−,−,+) shape is allowed and the other two k where (+,−,−) is allowed yields a satisfying assignment. This reduces to a simple feasibility check on the multiset { (α_k,β_k) : k∈A } and whether exactly two of them admit (−,−,+) (the rest admitting (+,−,−)).\n- Actionable use: Once F(+,+),F(+,-) are computed, form, for each ordered pair type, the set S_perm(α,β)⊆{(+−−),(−+−),(−−+)} of allowed ordered shapes. If for a given one‑point instance there exists a 2+2 choice with exactly two k’s assigned to a shape in S_perm that matches the 2+2 distribution above, the 2+2 ansatz succeeds even if the third permutation is disallowed. This is a small combinatorial check (choose which two indices carry the “(−,−,+)” triangles).\n\nBacktracking solver blueprint (deterministic, tiny) with propagation\n- Choose a starting triangle, e.g. Y_4, and branch on its allowed triple set F(p^B_4,p^C_4) (≤8 branches). For each branch (x_{12},x_{13},x_{23}) fixed, propagate to Y_1 (which shares {x_{23}}), Y_2 (shares {x_{13}}), Y_3 (shares {x_{12}}) by intersecting their allowed sets with the corresponding fiber:\n  • Y_1 reduces F(p^B_1,p^C_1) by fixing its first of the three local variables to x_{23} (remember mapping: for Y_1 the last three coordinates are (x_{23},x_{24},x_{34})). Similarly for Y_2 and Y_3 via their shared edge.\n- Use two pruning rules:\n  • If any Y_k’s local set becomes empty, backtrack.\n  • Track the triangle‑product parity (output.md Lemma 17): if the partial assignment forces an odd number of triangles to have product −1 with no flexibility left to flip an even count, backtrack.\n- Depth is at most 4 steps; in most cases the branching factor collapses quickly.\n\nConcrete test vectors to complete the 2+2 permutation checks (implement next)\n- For (α,β)=(+,+): test the missing permutation (+,+,−,+,−) in addition to the two already listed in notes ( (+,+,−,−,+), (+,+,+,−,−) ).\n- For (α,β)=(+,-): test the missing permutation (+,−,−,+,−) in addition to ( (+,−,−,−,+), (+,−,+,−,−) ).\n- These two additional evaluations complete the 6 decisive checks needed to apply Prop. 11 (three permutations for each of the two base tables), modulo Cor. 9 for the sign‑flipped cases.\n\nSanity/unit tests for IsO5 and F‑tables (succinct list)\n- IsO5 must classify: (+,−,−,−,−) as O5; (+,+,+,+,+) and (+,−,+,−,+) as non‑O5; and the samples under “Explicit ε …” should yield A_τ(e_O) as written (check via Lemma 20).\n- F(+,+) must contain (+++) (output.md Prop. 14 witness) and F(−,−) must contain (−−−). F(+,-) must contain (+,−,+) and F(−,+) must contain (−,+,−). The new Lemma EX1 adds: F(+,-) forbids the ordered (++−).\n\nGaps and clarifications in output.md (for later incorporation; do not edit now)\n- It would help to add the product‑of‑entries identity for O5 (∏p_i=sgn(τ)) as a corollary after Lemma 20; it is a convenient invariant for debugging and hand checks.\n- The weaker 2+2 feasibility reduction sketched above (choose two k for (−,−,+), two for (+,−,−)) could be formulated as a proposition conditional on the explicitly computed S_perm(α,β); this avoids requiring all three permutations as in Prop. 11. Once F‑tables are known, this is a two‑line check per instance.\n\nNext steps for the verifier (minimal and decisive)\n1) Build S via Lemmas 18–19 and implement IsO5 using Lemma 20. Validate on the sample pairs and unit tests listed.\n2) Populate F(+,+), F(+,-) fully (8 triples each). Record complements and confirm the witnesses from Prop. 14 and Lemma EX1.\n3) Run the six decisive 2+2‑permutation checks listed above. If they all pass, invoke Prop. 11. If not, apply the weaker 2+2 selection test using S_perm(α,β); if still inconclusive, run the shallow backtracking solver.\n\nWhy this is incremental, auditable progress\n- We added a new explicit exclusion in F(+,-) (ordered (++−) forbidden) with a concrete τ‑witness and no computation.\n- We provided additional ε/(ε,i0) samples and a product‑of‑entries invariant that make the S‑oracle easy to validate.\n- We sharpened how to use the 2+2 ansatz with only two permutations available per triangle (a simple selection check once the tables are computed) and supplied the two missing test vectors to complete the decisive 12‑entry check for Prop. 11.\n"}
