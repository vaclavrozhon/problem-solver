  "progress_md": "Round 0008 \u2014 Tightening the local F-tables with exact S-pair witnesses; correcting a subtle misuse of i0; minimal but rigorous exclusions\n\nContext and aim\n- We keep the framework in output.md: the |A|=4 one\u2011point step is a 6\u2011variable CSP with four local 5\u2011set constraints Y_k (Prop. 3). The decisive tool for O5 membership is now Lemma 20 (the exact S\u2011pair criterion), together with Lemmas 18\u201319 for computing \u03b5(\u03c4).\n- Goal this round: record a few rigorously proved forbidden entries for the base tables F(+,+) and F(+,-) using explicit \u03c4 and the S\u2011pair criterion, and correct an earlier pitfall about choosing i0. These small exclusions are auditable and shrink the remaining enumeration.\n\nNew, rigorous micro\u2011lemmas (using Lemma 20)\n- Lemma F1. In F(+,+), the ordered triple (x,y,z)=(-,+,+) is forbidden.\n  Why: Take \u03c4=(13). By Lemma 8, \u03b5(\u03c4)=(-,-,-,-,-). Here i0:=\u03c4(1)=3. Lemma 20 then gives A_\u03c4(e_O) with coordinates p_i=\u03b5_i for i=3 and p_i=\u2212\u03b5_i for i\u22603, namely p=(+,+,\u2212,+,+). Thus (\u2212,+,+)\u2209F(+,+). This is a concrete O5 instance in the fixed coordinate order.\n  Consequence: |{\u00b11}^3\\F(+,+)| \u2265 1. (This does not yet falsify the union\u2011bound criterion, but it is a firm, testable exclusion.)\n\n- Lemma F2 (already in output.md, restated for completeness). In F(+,-), (x,y,z)=(\u2212,\u2212,\u2212) is forbidden (Lemma 13). By Corollary 9, in F(\u2212,+), (+++) is forbidden.\n\n- Corollary F1\u2032 (by sign symmetry). In F(\u2212,\u2212), the ordered triple (+,\u2212,\u2212) is forbidden (triplewise negation of Lemma F1). Proof: Apply Corollary 9 to F1.\n  Consequence: |{\u00b11}^3\\F(\u2212,\u2212)| \u2265 1.\n\nWhy useful here\n- These entries are established via the exact S\u2011pair criterion (Lemma 20) with explicit \u03c4, hence they are rigorous and independently verifiable. They prune the base tables and sharpen expectations for the remaining entries that the verifier will compute.\n- F1 in particular shows that not all \u201ctwo\u2011plus one\u2011minus\u201d ordered patterns are allowed in F(+,+). This impacts both the union\u2011bound route (Lemma 16) and any uniform 2+2 construction that might rely on arbitrary permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212): the precise ordered membership matters.\n\nImportant correction of a subtle pitfall (auditable)\n- Earlier drafts (and my own heuristic in a past round) tried to classify O5 via the \u03b5\u2011only condition \u03a3 p_i \u03b5_i = \u22123 (or Hamming(\u2212p,\u03b5)=1). This is necessary but not sufficient; it ignores the i0 matching constraint i0=\u03c4(1) that Lemma 20 enforces. In particular, attempting to certify (+++)\u2208O5 for (\u03b1,\u03b2)=(+,-) by picking \u03b5\u2261\u22121 and i0 arbitrary is invalid. Any O5 membership must be demonstrated via an explicit \u03c4 (or via the precomputed S\u2011set), not \u03b5 alone.\n- As a concrete illustration of why i0 matters, for \u03c4=(23) one has \u03b5(\u03c4)=(\u2212,+,+,\u2212,\u2212) and i0=\u03c4(1)=1; the image A_\u03c4(e_O) is (\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,+,+), not (+,\u2212,+,+,+). The earlier shortcut that tacitly took i0=3 was incorrect; Lemma 20 clarifies the bookkeeping and prevents such slips.\n\nExamples (fully worked, for audit)\n- F1 computation in detail. \u03c4=(13) has \u03b5(\u03c4)=(-,-,-,-,-) (Lemma 8), i0=3. By Lemma 20, p=A_\u03c4(e_O) has p_3=\u03b5_3=\u2212 and p_i=\u2212\u03b5_i=+ for i\u22603, hence p=(+,+,\u2212,+,+). This matches (\u03b1,\u03b2,x,y,z)=(+,+,\u2212,+,+), so (\u2212,+,+) is excluded from F(+,+).\n- F2 remains the canonical case: for (\u03b1,\u03b2)=(+,-) and (x,y,z)=(\u2212,\u2212,\u2212), p=(+,-,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212) is the standard O5 representative.\n\nObstacles and scope\n- Proving further entries without precomputing S is delicate because of the i0 constraint. For instance, it is tempting (but not justified) to generalize F1 to say that all three permutations of a \u201ctwo\u2011plus one\u2011minus\u201d triple are forbidden in F(+,+) by conjugating \u03c4=(13); this requires tracking \u03b5 under conjugation (which is nontrivial) and verifying i0 for the same \u03c4.\n- Likewise, attempting to certify (+++)\u2209F(+,-) purely from \u03b5\u2261\u22121 fails absent an explicit \u03c4 with \u03b5(\u03c4)=\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212 and \u03c4(1)=2. This should be decided computationally via S.\n\nImpact on global strategies\n- Union\u2011bound (Lemma 16). Since we have only shown \u22651 forbidden ordered triple in F(+,+) and in F(\u2212,\u2212), the condition \u201cforbid at most one triple per table\u201d is not yet falsified. A tiny computation of the two base tables F(+,+), F(+,-) remains the quickest path to either applying Lemma 16 or to proceeding with the backtracking/SAT approach.\n- 2+2 ansatz (Prop. 11). The vertex\u2011sign method produces only (+++) and permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212). F1 shows that in the equal\u2011fixed case (++), at least one of the three permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212) is actually forbidden (the one with \u2018\u2212\u2019 in position 3). Whether the two permutations realized by a specific 2+2 choice of w are allowed is a factual question for F(+,+). Computing the full ordered table F(+,+) resolves this immediately.\n\nActionable next steps for the verifier (minimal and decisive)\n1) Build S and IsO5 exactly as in Lemma 20 (output.md); retain unit tests already listed in notes/output.\n2) Populate F(+,+), F(+,-) completely (8 entries each) under the fixed coordinate order; derive F(\u2212,\u2212), F(\u2212,+) by Corollary 9. Confirm:\n   - The new exclusion from Lemma F1: (\u2212,+,+)\u2209F(+,+).\n   - The standard exclusion from Lemma 13: (\u2212,\u2212,\u2212)\u2209F(+,-).\n3) If both complements have size \u22641, apply Cor. 16.1 to conclude the |A|=4 step and AP. Otherwise:\n   - Check whether the two ordered permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212) that arise under a 2+2 choice w (as in notes) lie in the relevant F(\u03b1,\u03b2) for each k; if yes, apply Prop. 11.\n   - If not, run the 2^6 brute\u2011force CSP per realized profile or the small backtracking solver with parity pruning (Lemma 17).\n4) Evaluate the four P1\u2013P3 5\u2011vectors from notes against IsO5; archive their status to quickly validate the 2+2 witnesses already proposed for those profiles.\n\nNotes on output.md (gaps/clarifications)\n- The new Lemma 20 (S\u2011pair criterion) is precisely the right tool; no contradictions found. The pitfalls around \u03b5\u2011only criteria are now avoided.\n- Suggestion (for later integration): Record Lemma F1 explicitly when the F\u2011tables are finalized, to document at least one ordered exclusion in F(+,+). This will help readers reproduce the non\u2011symmetry across ordered triples.\n\nSummary of incremental progress\n- Provided a new, exact O5 exclusion in the equal\u2011fixed case (Lemma F1: (\u2212,+,+)\u2209F(+,+)) with a concrete \u03c4 witness, tightening the F(+,+) table.\n- Reiterated the correct use of Lemma 20 and corrected a subtle but frequent mistake (misassigning i0), preventing false positives like the earlier (+++) claim for F(+,-).\n- Clarified how these facts intersect with union\u2011bound and the 2+2 ansatz, and distilled the next minimal computations needed to close |A|=4 and hence AP.\n"
