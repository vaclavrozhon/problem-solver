  "summary_md": "Round 0008 produced three complementary prover notes that sharply reduce the remaining computation needed to close the |A|=4 step. New rigorous lemmas (21\u201323) extract internal S5-induced symmetries: a swap (12) yields central symmetry F(\u03b1,\u03b1), two internal generators (S3,S4) act on the last three coordinates, and their composition gives the x\u2194z swap. These symmetries partition {\u00b11}^3 into small orbits and cut each base table to at most four representatives. Practically, the 2+2 vertex\u2011sign ansatz requires only two decisive membership checks ( (+,\u2212,\u2212) in F(+,+) and in F(+,\u2212) ), or a slightly weaker feasibility check on the realized multiset of pair\u2011types. The round also produced auditable explicit witnesses: a product\u2011of\u2011entries invariant \u220f p_i = sgn(\u03c4) for O5, a certified forbidden triple (++\u2212)\u2209F(+,\u2212) (\u03c4=(12)(34)), and (\u2212,+,+)\u2209F(+,+) (\u03c4=(13)). A subtle bookkeeping correction was made: \u03b5 alone is not enough\u2014i0 must be tracked via the \u03c4 witness (Lemma 20). Next steps are to implement/validate IsO5, run symmetry unit tests, evaluate the decisive entries, and fall back to the tiny 2^6 CSP/backtracking only if needed.",
  "highlights": [
    "Lemmas 21\u201323 (from prover-01) prove internal symmetries: central symmetry F(\u03b1,\u03b1), generators S3/S4 on the last three coordinates, and an x\u2194z swap; these preserve triple\u2011product and reduce per\u2011table checks to \u22644 representatives.",
    "For the 2+2 ansatz it suffices (modulo the stated caveats) to test two entries: (+,\u2212,\u2212) in F(+,+) and (+,\u2212,\u2212) in F(+,\u2212); a weaker feasibility selection test is also given if only two permutations are available.",
    "Prover-02 gives a handy invariant for O5: the product of coordinates of any O5 vector equals sgn(\u03c4) for its witness \u03c4 \u2014 useful for S\u2011oracle sanity checks.",
    "Two explicit, auditable exclusions found via exact \u03c4 witnesses: (++\u2212) \u2209 F(+,\u2212) (\u03c4=(12)(34)) and (\u2212,+,+) \u2209 F(+,+) (\u03c4=(13)) \u2014 these shrink the search space without enumeration.",
    "A bookkeeping correction (prover-03): \u03b5 alone is insufficient to certify O5 membership; i0 (=\u03c4(1)) must be tracked when applying Lemma 20 \u2014 avoids false positives."

    "Evaluate the two decisive table entries: (+,\u2212,\u2212) for F(+,+) and for F(+,\u2212). If both hold, apply Prop. 11; otherwise populate the full F(+,+)/F(+,\u2212) (4 representatives each) and run the 2^6 CSP/backtracking fallback.",
