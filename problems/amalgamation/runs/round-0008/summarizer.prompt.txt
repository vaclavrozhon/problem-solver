Round 0008 — Shrinking the F-table computation via internal S5-induced symmetries; two decisive membership checks for the 2+2 ansatz

Status and aim
- We keep the one‑point reduction and the |A|=4 six‑variable CSP (output.md Prop. 3). The S‑based O5 membership test is now rigorous (output.md Lemma 20), as are the ε‑cocycle and generator data (Lemmas 18–19). The remaining bottleneck is to populate the two base tables F(+,+) and F(+,-) and then close |A|=4 either by the 2+2 ansatz (Prop. 11) or by a tiny brute force, if needed.

New rigor: S5 actions that preserve the (α,β) table and their effect on triples
- Notation and convention: We use the fixed coordinate order for p(Y_k) recorded in output.md: (missing c, missing b, then the three positions missing i<j<ℓ from A\{k}). For the local table F(α,β), membership is: (x,y,z)∈F(α,β) ⇔ (α,β,x,y,z) is non‑O5.

Lemma 21 (swap of the fixed coordinates enforces central symmetry at α=β).
- Statement. For all α,β and (x,y,z), one has
  (x,y,z)∈F(α,β) ⇔ (−x,−y,−z)∈F(β,α).
  In particular, if α=β, then F(α,α) is centrally symmetric: (x,y,z)∈F(α,α) ⇔ (−x,−y,−z)∈F(α,α).
- Proof. Apply τ=(12). By Lemma 19, ε(τ)=(+,+,−,−,−). The action A_τ swaps the first two coordinates and flips signs on the last three: A_τ(α,β,x,y,z)=(β,α,−x,−y,−z). O5‑membership is invariant under A_τ; hence (α,β,x,y,z) is non‑O5 ⇔ (β,α,−x,−y,−z) is non‑O5. This is exactly the claim.∎
- Use: reduces F(+,+) to four unordered pairs of opposite triples, and relates F(+,-) to F(−,+) (though we already have Cor. 9 for global sign flip).

Lemma 22 (two internal generators acting on last three coordinates while preserving (α,β)).
- Statements. For all α,β and all (x,y,z), one has the equivalences within the same table F(α,β):
  (S3) (x,y,z)∈F(α,β) ⇔ (−y,−x,z)∈F(α,β).
  (S4) (x,y,z)∈F(α,β) ⇔ (x,−z,−y)∈F(α,β).
- Proof. For S3 use τ=(34). Lemma 19 gives ε(τ)=(−,−,+,+,−). Then A_τ(α,β,x,y,z)= (−α,−β, y, x, −z). By Cor. 9 (global sign symmetry), (−α,−β, y, x, −z) is non‑O5 iff (α,β, −y, −x, z) is non‑O5. This yields S3. For S4 use τ=(45) with ε(τ)=(−,−,−,+,+), giving A_τ(α,β,x,y,z)=(−α,−β, −x, z, y). Applying Cor. 9 again gives (α,β, x, −z, −y), i.e., S4.∎
- Use: S3 and S4 generate a small group of transformations on triples inside a fixed table F(α,β) that preserve triple‑product and relate many ordered patterns without touching α,β.

Lemma 23 (a coordinate swap on triples that preserves (α,β)).
- Statement. For all α,β and all (x,y,z), one has (x,y,z)∈F(α,β) ⇔ (z,y,x)∈F(α,β).
- Proof. Combine S4, then S3, then S4 again. Starting with (x,y,z), S4 gives (x,−z,−y); S3 then gives (z,y,−x); S4 again gives (z,y,x). Each step preserves membership in F(α,β), hence the equivalence.∎
- Use: F(α,β) is invariant under swapping the first and third triple coordinates, a key reduction for the 2+2 ansatz.

Consequences for orbits of {±1}^3 under these internal symmetries
- The group generated by S3, S4, and the swap (x,y,z)↔(z,y,x) (Lemma 23) preserves triple‑product and partitions {±1}^3 into the following orbits:
  • Product +1: O+_A = { (+++), (+−−), (−−+) } and O+_B = { (−+−) }.
  • Product −1: O−_A = { (−−−), (++−), (−++) } and O−_B = { (+−+) }.
  The equivalences S3/S4 connect the two 3‑element orbits (within each parity) and leave the 1‑element orbits fixed; Lemma 23 allows us to permute x and z, ensuring (+−−) and (−−+) are interchangeable inside F(α,β).
- Reduction of F‑table workload: To determine F(α,β) completely, it suffices to test at most four representatives: (+++), (+−−), (−−−), (+−+). The remaining 4 triples follow by the above orbit relations and Lemma 21 when α=β (central symmetry).

Refined implications for the 2+2 vertex‑sign ansatz (Prop. 11)
- Under the fixed coordinate convention (output.md), the 2+2 vertex‑sign ansatz (Lemma 10) produces, for any choice of the two “+” vertices on A, on each triangle an ordered triple that is either (+,−,−) or (−,−,+). The permutation (−,+,−) never occurs under this ansatz.
- By Lemma 23 (x↔z swap) the two realized permutations are equivalent inside any fixed F(α,β). Therefore, for Prop. 11 it suffices to check a single representative:
  • Decisive checks: (+,−,−)∈F(+,+) and (+,−,−)∈F(+,-).
  If both hold, then by Lemma 23 the other realized permutation (−,−,+) also lies in F, and Prop. 11 yields a uniform |A|=4 solution, hence AP (via Lemma 2). By Cor. 9, the remaining two cases (−,−) and (−,+) follow by triplewise negation.
- This sharpens and justifies the “two‑checks suffice” reduction proposed earlier (now with full proofs relying on S3/S4/Lemma 23). Note this is weaker than assuming all three permutations of (+,−,−) are present; the ansatz never requires (−,+,−).

Concrete micro‑tests and minimal computation plan (auditable)
- Unit tests for the new symmetries (to sanity‑check the IsO5 implementation and the F‑tables):
  1) Verify S3/S4 on sample inputs: For a random (α,β) and triple t, confirm IsO5(α,β,t) equals IsO5(α,β,−y,−x,z) and IsO5(α,β,x,−z,−y).
  2) Verify Lemma 23: IsO5(α,β,x,y,z)=IsO5(α,β,z,y,x).
  3) Verify Lemma 21: IsO5(α,β,x,y,z)=IsO5(β,α,−x,−y,−z).
- Minimal decisive F‑entries to evaluate with the S‑oracle (output.md Lemma 20):
  • For F(+,+): check (+,−,−). (+++) is known allowed (Prop. 14 for |A|=3; also C5), so (−,−,−) follows by Lemma 21.
  • For F(+,-): check (+,−,−) and retain that (+,−,+) is allowed (Prop. 14). (−,−,−) is forbidden (Lemma 13).
  Derive the remaining two base tables by Cor. 9. Using Lemma 23, if (+,−,−) is allowed in a table, (−,−,+) is automatically allowed too.
- Four pre‑existing decisive 5‑vector tests (still recommended):
  • For F(+,+): (+,+,+,−,−) and (+,+,−,−,+) (the two realized permutations under w=(+,+,−,−)).
  • For F(+,-): (+,−,+,−,−) and (+,−,−,−,+).
  Each should be non‑O5 for the 2+2 ansatz to succeed on the corresponding profiles.

Examples and sanity data already fixed by output.md
- F(+,+) contains (+++) and, by Lemma 21, also (−−−).
- F(+,-) contains (+,−,+) (Prop. 14) and forbids (−−−) (Lemma 13). The status of (+++) in F(+,-) remains to be decided by the S‑oracle (do not assume).

Why this is incremental, auditable progress
- New, fully rigorous lemmas (21–23) extract symmetry directly from the S5 action (using only Lemmas 6, 8, 19) and sharply reduce the local enumeration:
  • Per base table, at most four representatives need evaluation to reconstruct all 8 entries.
  • For the 2+2 ansatz, only two total tests are decisive: (+,−,−)∈F(+,+) and (+,−,−)∈F(+,-).
- These are immediately testable with the existing S‑oracle plan (output.md Lemma 20). They also supply strong unit tests to validate an implementation.

Obstacles and open items
- An analytic (non‑computational) classification of S remains difficult; we therefore continue to rely on the small enumeration via the S‑oracle. The new symmetries minimize the number of required queries.
- If either of the two decisive checks fails, the uniform 2+2 construction (Prop. 11) is unavailable. The fallback remains the tiny 2^6 CSP search with parity pruning (output.md Lemma 17) or the specific solvable subclass (Prop. 15).

Gaps or clarifications for output.md (do not edit now; for later integration)
- Adding Lemmas 21–23 would be valuable: they formalize the internal invariances that reduce F‑table computation and justify the “two‑checks suffice” reduction for Prop. 11.
- When the F‑tables are eventually archived, include a note that they are invariant under the transforms S3, S4, and x↔z, and that F(α,α) is centrally symmetric (Lemma 21), to aid reproducibility and debugging.

Next steps for the verifier (minimal, decisive)
1) Implement/validate the S‑oracle IsO5 (output.md Lemma 20). Run the unit tests in output.md and the symmetry checks listed above (S3/S4/Lemma 23/Lemma 21).
2) Evaluate the two decisive entries: (+,−,−) in F(+,+) and in F(+,-). If both pass, conclude |A|=4 via Prop. 11 and AP via Lemma 2.
3) If needed, populate the full F(+,+), F(+,-) using only the four representatives (+++), (+−−), (−−−), (+−+) and derive all entries by the proved symmetries. Cross‑check against the four P1–P3 vectors.
4) If Prop. 11 fails, run the small 2^6 search with parity pruning and archive either SAT witnesses or a minimal UNSAT certificate (which would refute AP).

=== prover-02.out.json (progress_md) ===
Status and aim
- We keep the one‑point reduction and the |A|=4 six‑variable CSP (output.md Prop. 3). The exact O5 membership test via the pair‑set S (output.md Lemma 20), the ε‑cocycle (Lemma 18), and ε on generators (Lemma 19) are now in output.md and are sufficient to implement a correct IsO5.
- Remaining blocker: populate the two base local tables F(+,+) and F(+,-), then conclude |A|=4 either by the 2+2 construction (Prop. 11, conditional) or a tiny brute‑force/backtracking run.

New small, rigorous facts (auditable)
1) Product‑of‑entries identity for O5 (debug/check aid).
- Claim. If p∈O5 with witness τ in Lemma 20 (i.e., p=A_τ(e_O)), then ∏_{i=1}^5 p_i = sgn(τ).
- Proof. Writing p=flip_all_but_one(ε(τ), i0=τ(1)), we have ∏ p_i = ε_{i0}·∏_{i≠i0}(−ε_i) = (−1)^4∏_i ε_i = ∏_i ε_i = sgn(τ) by Corollary 7.∎
- Why useful: A quick invariant to sanity‑check an S‑oracle and any hand‑computed witnesses.

2) A concrete forbidden ordered triple in F(+,-).
- Lemma EX1. For (α,β)=(+,-), the ordered triple (x,y,z)=(+,+,−) is forbidden, i.e., ( +, −, +, +, − ) ∈ O5.
- Proof. Take τ=(12)(34), which is even; by direct computation (already in notes and rechecked here) ε(τ)=(−,−,−,−,+) and i0=τ(1)=2. Lemma 20 then gives p=A_τ(e_O)=flip_all_but_one(ε,2)=(+,−,+,+,−). Hence (x,y,z)=(+,+,−) is not in F(+,-).∎
- Why useful: This gives a certified entry of F(+,-) without any enumeration. It also provides a unit test for IsO5.

Explicit ε and (ε,i0) samples (for S‑oracle validation)
- τ=id: ε=(+,+,+,+,+), i0=1; ∏ε=+.
- τ=(12): ε=(+,+,−,−,−), i0=2; ∏ε=−.
- τ=(23): ε=(−,+,+,−,−), i0=1; ∏ε=−.
- τ=(34): ε=(−,−,+,+,−), i0=1; ∏ε=−.
- τ=(45): ε=(−,−,−,+,+), i0=1; ∏ε=−.
- τ=(12)(34): ε=(−,−,−,−,+), i0=2; ∏ε=+.
- τ=(123): ε=(+,−,−,+,+), i0=2; ∏ε=+.
- τ=(234): ε=(+,+,−,−,+), i0=1; ∏ε=+.
- τ=(345): ε=(+,+,+,−,−), i0=1; ∏ε=+.
These pairs should appear in S; they are also useful check‑points when debugging the cocycle BFS.

2+2 ansatz: precise permutation usage and a weaker feasibility reduction
- Reminder (output.md Lemma 10): with w having two + and two − and x_{ij}=w_iw_j, every triangle‑triple is a permutation of (+,−,−). Under our fixed coordinate order, for the concrete choice w=(+,+,−,−) on A={1,2,3,4}, one checks explicitly (as already used in notes) that:
  • Y_1,Y_2 realize the ordered shape (−,−,+); Y_3,Y_4 realize (+,−,−).
- Consequently, a weaker conditional than Prop. 11 suffices in practice:
  • If for every realized pair type (α_k,β_k), both ordered shapes (+,−,−) and (−,−,+) are in F(α_k,β_k), then choosing w so that the two “+” are placed on the two indices k where the (−,−,+) shape is allowed and the other two k where (+,−,−) is allowed yields a satisfying assignment. This reduces to a simple feasibility check on the multiset { (α_k,β_k) : k∈A } and whether exactly two of them admit (−,−,+) (the rest admitting (+,−,−)).
- Actionable use: Once F(+,+),F(+,-) are computed, form, for each ordered pair type, the set S_perm(α,β)⊆{(+−−),(−+−),(−−+)} of allowed ordered shapes. If for a given one‑point instance there exists a 2+2 choice with exactly two k’s assigned to a shape in S_perm that matches the 2+2 distribution above, the 2+2 ansatz succeeds even if the third permutation is disallowed. This is a small combinatorial check (choose which two indices carry the “(−,−,+)” triangles).

Backtracking solver blueprint (deterministic, tiny) with propagation
- Choose a starting triangle, e.g. Y_4, and branch on its allowed triple set F(p^B_4,p^C_4) (≤8 branches). For each branch (x_{12},x_{13},x_{23}) fixed, propagate to Y_1 (which shares {x_{23}}), Y_2 (shares {x_{13}}), Y_3 (shares {x_{12}}) by intersecting their allowed sets with the corresponding fiber:
  • Y_1 reduces F(p^B_1,p^C_1) by fixing its first of the three local variables to x_{23} (remember mapping: for Y_1 the last three coordinates are (x_{23},x_{24},x_{34})). Similarly for Y_2 and Y_3 via their shared edge.
- Use two pruning rules:
  • If any Y_k’s local set becomes empty, backtrack.
  • Track the triangle‑product parity (output.md Lemma 17): if the partial assignment forces an odd number of triangles to have product −1 with no flexibility left to flip an even count, backtrack.
- Depth is at most 4 steps; in most cases the branching factor collapses quickly.

Concrete test vectors to complete the 2+2 permutation checks (implement next)
- For (α,β)=(+,+): test the missing permutation (+,+,−,+,−) in addition to the two already listed in notes ( (+,+,−,−,+), (+,+,+,−,−) ).
- For (α,β)=(+,-): test the missing permutation (+,−,−,+,−) in addition to ( (+,−,−,−,+), (+,−,+,−,−) ).
- These two additional evaluations complete the 6 decisive checks needed to apply Prop. 11 (three permutations for each of the two base tables), modulo Cor. 9 for the sign‑flipped cases.

Sanity/unit tests for IsO5 and F‑tables (succinct list)
- IsO5 must classify: (+,−,−,−,−) as O5; (+,+,+,+,+) and (+,−,+,−,+) as non‑O5; and the samples under “Explicit ε …” should yield A_τ(e_O) as written (check via Lemma 20).
- F(+,+) must contain (+++) (output.md Prop. 14 witness) and F(−,−) must contain (−−−). F(+,-) must contain (+,−,+) and F(−,+) must contain (−,+,−). The new Lemma EX1 adds: F(+,-) forbids the ordered (++−).

Gaps and clarifications in output.md (for later incorporation; do not edit now)
- It would help to add the product‑of‑entries identity for O5 (∏p_i=sgn(τ)) as a corollary after Lemma 20; it is a convenient invariant for debugging and hand checks.
- The weaker 2+2 feasibility reduction sketched above (choose two k for (−,−,+), two for (+,−,−)) could be formulated as a proposition conditional on the explicitly computed S_perm(α,β); this avoids requiring all three permutations as in Prop. 11. Once F‑tables are known, this is a two‑line check per instance.

Next steps for the verifier (minimal and decisive)
1) Build S via Lemmas 18–19 and implement IsO5 using Lemma 20. Validate on the sample pairs and unit tests listed.
2) Populate F(+,+), F(+,-) fully (8 triples each). Record complements and confirm the witnesses from Prop. 14 and Lemma EX1.
3) Run the six decisive 2+2‑permutation checks listed above. If they all pass, invoke Prop. 11. If not, apply the weaker 2+2 selection test using S_perm(α,β); if still inconclusive, run the shallow backtracking solver.

Why this is incremental, auditable progress
- We added a new explicit exclusion in F(+,-) (ordered (++−) forbidden) with a concrete τ‑witness and no computation.
- We provided additional ε/(ε,i0) samples and a product‑of‑entries invariant that make the S‑oracle easy to validate.
- We sharpened how to use the 2+2 ansatz with only two permutations available per triangle (a simple selection check once the tables are computed) and supplied the two missing test vectors to complete the decisive 12‑entry check for Prop. 11.

Round 0008 — Tightening the local F-tables with exact S-pair witnesses; correcting a subtle misuse of i0; minimal but rigorous exclusions

Context and aim
- We keep the framework in output.md: the |A|=4 one‑point step is a 6‑variable CSP with four local 5‑set constraints Y_k (Prop. 3). The decisive tool for O5 membership is now Lemma 20 (the exact S‑pair criterion), together with Lemmas 18–19 for computing ε(τ).
- Goal this round: record a few rigorously proved forbidden entries for the base tables F(+,+) and F(+,-) using explicit τ and the S‑pair criterion, and correct an earlier pitfall about choosing i0. These small exclusions are auditable and shrink the remaining enumeration.

New, rigorous micro‑lemmas (using Lemma 20)
- Lemma F1. In F(+,+), the ordered triple (x,y,z)=(-,+,+) is forbidden.
  Why: Take τ=(13). By Lemma 8, ε(τ)=(-,-,-,-,-). Here i0:=τ(1)=3. Lemma 20 then gives A_τ(e_O) with coordinates p_i=ε_i for i=3 and p_i=−ε_i for i≠3, namely p=(+,+,−,+,+). Thus (−,+,+)∉F(+,+). This is a concrete O5 instance in the fixed coordinate order.
  Consequence: |{±1}^3\F(+,+)| ≥ 1. (This does not yet falsify the union‑bound criterion, but it is a firm, testable exclusion.)

- Lemma F2 (already in output.md, restated for completeness). In F(+,-), (x,y,z)=(−,−,−) is forbidden (Lemma 13). By Corollary 9, in F(−,+), (+++) is forbidden.

- Corollary F1′ (by sign symmetry). In F(−,−), the ordered triple (+,−,−) is forbidden (triplewise negation of Lemma F1). Proof: Apply Corollary 9 to F1.
  Consequence: |{±1}^3\F(−,−)| ≥ 1.

Why useful here
- These entries are established via the exact S‑pair criterion (Lemma 20) with explicit τ, hence they are rigorous and independently verifiable. They prune the base tables and sharpen expectations for the remaining entries that the verifier will compute.
- F1 in particular shows that not all “two‑plus one‑minus” ordered patterns are allowed in F(+,+). This impacts both the union‑bound route (Lemma 16) and any uniform 2+2 construction that might rely on arbitrary permutations of (+,−,−): the precise ordered membership matters.

Important correction of a subtle pitfall (auditable)
- Earlier drafts (and my own heuristic in a past round) tried to classify O5 via the ε‑only condition Σ p_i ε_i = −3 (or Hamming(−p,ε)=1). This is necessary but not sufficient; it ignores the i0 matching constraint i0=τ(1) that Lemma 20 enforces. In particular, attempting to certify (+++)∈O5 for (α,β)=(+,-) by picking ε≡−1 and i0 arbitrary is invalid. Any O5 membership must be demonstrated via an explicit τ (or via the precomputed S‑set), not ε alone.
- As a concrete illustration of why i0 matters, for τ=(23) one has ε(τ)=(−,+,+,−,−) and i0=τ(1)=1; the image A_τ(e_O) is (−,−,−,+,+), not (+,−,+,+,+). The earlier shortcut that tacitly took i0=3 was incorrect; Lemma 20 clarifies the bookkeeping and prevents such slips.

Examples (fully worked, for audit)
- F1 computation in detail. τ=(13) has ε(τ)=(-,-,-,-,-) (Lemma 8), i0=3. By Lemma 20, p=A_τ(e_O) has p_3=ε_3=− and p_i=−ε_i=+ for i≠3, hence p=(+,+,−,+,+). This matches (α,β,x,y,z)=(+,+,−,+,+), so (−,+,+) is excluded from F(+,+).
- F2 remains the canonical case: for (α,β)=(+,-) and (x,y,z)=(−,−,−), p=(+,-,−,−,−) is the standard O5 representative.

Obstacles and scope
- Proving further entries without precomputing S is delicate because of the i0 constraint. For instance, it is tempting (but not justified) to generalize F1 to say that all three permutations of a “two‑plus one‑minus” triple are forbidden in F(+,+) by conjugating τ=(13); this requires tracking ε under conjugation (which is nontrivial) and verifying i0 for the same τ.
- Likewise, attempting to certify (+++)∉F(+,-) purely from ε≡−1 fails absent an explicit τ with ε(τ)=−−−−− and τ(1)=2. This should be decided computationally via S.

Impact on global strategies
- Union‑bound (Lemma 16). Since we have only shown ≥1 forbidden ordered triple in F(+,+) and in F(−,−), the condition “forbid at most one triple per table” is not yet falsified. A tiny computation of the two base tables F(+,+), F(+,-) remains the quickest path to either applying Lemma 16 or to proceeding with the backtracking/SAT approach.
- 2+2 ansatz (Prop. 11). The vertex‑sign method produces only (+++) and permutations of (+,−,−). F1 shows that in the equal‑fixed case (++), at least one of the three permutations of (+,−,−) is actually forbidden (the one with ‘−’ in position 3). Whether the two permutations realized by a specific 2+2 choice of w are allowed is a factual question for F(+,+). Computing the full ordered table F(+,+) resolves this immediately.

Actionable next steps for the verifier (minimal and decisive)
1) Build S and IsO5 exactly as in Lemma 20 (output.md); retain unit tests already listed in notes/output.
2) Populate F(+,+), F(+,-) completely (8 entries each) under the fixed coordinate order; derive F(−,−), F(−,+) by Corollary 9. Confirm:
   - The new exclusion from Lemma F1: (−,+,+)∉F(+,+).
   - The standard exclusion from Lemma 13: (−,−,−)∉F(+,-).
3) If both complements have size ≤1, apply Cor. 16.1 to conclude the |A|=4 step and AP. Otherwise:
   - Check whether the two ordered permutations of (+,−,−) that arise under a 2+2 choice w (as in notes) lie in the relevant F(α,β) for each k; if yes, apply Prop. 11.
   - If not, run the 2^6 brute‑force CSP per realized profile or the small backtracking solver with parity pruning (Lemma 17).
4) Evaluate the four P1–P3 5‑vectors from notes against IsO5; archive their status to quickly validate the 2+2 witnesses already proposed for those profiles.

Notes on output.md (gaps/clarifications)
- The new Lemma 20 (S‑pair criterion) is precisely the right tool; no contradictions found. The pitfalls around ε‑only criteria are now avoided.
- Suggestion (for later integration): Record Lemma F1 explicitly when the F‑tables are finalized, to document at least one ordered exclusion in F(+,+). This will help readers reproduce the non‑symmetry across ordered triples.

Summary of incremental progress
- Provided a new, exact O5 exclusion in the equal‑fixed case (Lemma F1: (−,+,+)∉F(+,+)) with a concrete τ witness, tightening the F(+,+) table.
- Reiterated the correct use of Lemma 20 and corrected a subtle but frequent mistake (misassigning i0), preventing false positives like the earlier (+++) claim for F(+,-).
- Clarified how these facts intersect with union‑bound and the 2+2 ansatz, and distilled the next minimal computations needed to close |A|=4 and hence AP.
