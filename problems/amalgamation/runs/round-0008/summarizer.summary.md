Round 0008 produced three complementary prover notes that sharply reduce the remaining computation needed to close the |A|=4 step. New rigorous lemmas (21–23) extract internal S5-induced symmetries: a swap (12) yields central symmetry F(α,α), two internal generators (S3,S4) act on the last three coordinates, and their composition gives the x↔z swap. These symmetries partition {±1}^3 into small orbits and cut each base table to at most four representatives. Practically, the 2+2 vertex‑sign ansatz requires only two decisive membership checks ( (+,−,−) in F(+,+) and in F(+,−) ), or a slightly weaker feasibility check on the realized multiset of pair‑types. The round also produced auditable explicit witnesses: a product‑of‑entries invariant ∏ p_i = sgn(τ) for O5, a certified forbidden triple (++−)∉F(+,−) (τ=(12)(34)), and (−,+,+)∉F(+,+) (τ=(13)). A subtle bookkeeping correction was made: ε alone is not enough—i0 must be tracked via the τ witness (Lemma 20). Next steps are to implement/validate IsO5, run symmetry unit tests, evaluate the decisive entries, and fall back to the tiny 2^6 CSP/backtracking only if needed.
