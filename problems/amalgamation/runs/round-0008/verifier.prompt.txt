You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md and output.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers
- notes.md (summary so far)
- output.md (rigorously proven results so far)

Guidelines:
- notes.md: should be a readable running log of interesting work. Prefer appending. Replace only if old notes are clearly misleading. Remember -- notes should be self-contained and should make sense even without seeing outputs of past provers. 
- output.md:  Think twice before you add something to this file. Everything here should be rigorous, almost publication-ready. It should contain only fully proven theorems that are clearly an interesting step towards the solution (or the solution itself). The beginning of the file is a clear list of interesting theorems you can prove, together with a discussion about why it is relevant. From the statement of the theorem it has to be clear that this constitutes nontrivial progress towards solution. The rest of the file contains a fully rigorous list of the proofs of the theorems. Keep only proven theorems with clear proofs. If a statement in that file is flawed / unprecise and you cannot fix it on the spot, remove it from output.md and instead add it to notes.md with explanation.
- Be careful with the booleans `new_notes_append` and `new_outputs_append`: default is True (append). Use False only when deliberately rewriting everything.

Tasks:
1) Audit rigor: identify unjustified steps, false statements, missing lemmas; produce minimal counterexamples.
2) Triage value: separate genuine progress from noise.
3) Guide next steps: propose what provers should try next.

**Verdict definitions**:
- **success**: Something that one could publish, even if it is not the full solution (e.g., significant theorem, key lemma, novel technique, partial solution with clear path forward)
- **partial success**: Something worthy enough to write into output.md (e.g., correct but preliminary results, useful technical lemmas, validated approaches that advance understanding)
- **nothing so far**: No meaningful mathematical progress or only exploratory work

[{"prover_id": "01", "progress_md": "Round 0008 \u2014 Shrinking the F-table computation via internal S5-induced symmetries; two decisive membership checks for the 2+2 ansatz\n\nStatus and aim\n- We keep the one\u2011point reduction and the |A|=4 six\u2011variable CSP (output.md Prop. 3). The S\u2011based O5 membership test is now rigorous (output.md Lemma 20), as are the \u03b5\u2011cocycle and generator data (Lemmas 18\u201319). The remaining bottleneck is to populate the two base tables F(+,+) and F(+,-) and then close |A|=4 either by the 2+2 ansatz (Prop. 11) or by a tiny brute force, if needed.\n\nNew rigor: S5 actions that preserve the (\u03b1,\u03b2) table and their effect on triples\n- Notation and convention: We use the fixed coordinate order for p(Y_k) recorded in output.md: (missing c, missing b, then the three positions missing i<j<\u2113 from A\\{k}). For the local table F(\u03b1,\u03b2), membership is: (x,y,z)\u2208F(\u03b1,\u03b2) \u21d4 (\u03b1,\u03b2,x,y,z) is non\u2011O5.\n\nLemma 21 (swap of the fixed coordinates enforces central symmetry at \u03b1=\u03b2).\n- Statement. For all \u03b1,\u03b2 and (x,y,z), one has\n  (x,y,z)\u2208F(\u03b1,\u03b2) \u21d4 (\u2212x,\u2212y,\u2212z)\u2208F(\u03b2,\u03b1).\n  In particular, if \u03b1=\u03b2, then F(\u03b1,\u03b1) is centrally symmetric: (x,y,z)\u2208F(\u03b1,\u03b1) \u21d4 (\u2212x,\u2212y,\u2212z)\u2208F(\u03b1,\u03b1).\n- Proof. Apply \u03c4=(12). By Lemma 19, \u03b5(\u03c4)=(+,+,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212). The action A_\u03c4 swaps the first two coordinates and flips signs on the last three: A_\u03c4(\u03b1,\u03b2,x,y,z)=(\u03b2,\u03b1,\u2212x,\u2212y,\u2212z). O5\u2011membership is invariant under A_\u03c4; hence (\u03b1,\u03b2,x,y,z) is non\u2011O5 \u21d4 (\u03b2,\u03b1,\u2212x,\u2212y,\u2212z) is non\u2011O5. This is exactly the claim.\u220e\n- Use: reduces F(+,+) to four unordered pairs of opposite triples, and relates F(+,-) to F(\u2212,+) (though we already have Cor. 9 for global sign flip).\n\nLemma 22 (two internal generators acting on last three coordinates while preserving (\u03b1,\u03b2)).\n- Statements. For all \u03b1,\u03b2 and all (x,y,z), one has the equivalences within the same table F(\u03b1,\u03b2):\n  (S3) (x,y,z)\u2208F(\u03b1,\u03b2) \u21d4 (\u2212y,\u2212x,z)\u2208F(\u03b1,\u03b2).\n  (S4) (x,y,z)\u2208F(\u03b1,\u03b2) \u21d4 (x,\u2212z,\u2212y)\u2208F(\u03b1,\u03b2).\n- Proof. For S3 use \u03c4=(34). Lemma 19 gives \u03b5(\u03c4)=(\u2212,\u2212,+,+,\u2212). Then A_\u03c4(\u03b1,\u03b2,x,y,z)= (\u2212\u03b1,\u2212\u03b2, y, x, \u2212z). By Cor. 9 (global sign symmetry), (\u2212\u03b1,\u2212\u03b2, y, x, \u2212z) is non\u2011O5 iff (\u03b1,\u03b2, \u2212y, \u2212x, z) is non\u2011O5. This yields S3. For S4 use \u03c4=(45) with \u03b5(\u03c4)=(\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,+,+), giving A_\u03c4(\u03b1,\u03b2,x,y,z)=(\u2212\u03b1,\u2212\u03b2, \u2212x, z, y). Applying Cor. 9 again gives (\u03b1,\u03b2, x, \u2212z, \u2212y), i.e., S4.\u220e\n- Use: S3 and S4 generate a small group of transformations on triples inside a fixed table F(\u03b1,\u03b2) that preserve triple\u2011product and relate many ordered patterns without touching \u03b1,\u03b2.\n\nLemma 23 (a coordinate swap on triples that preserves (\u03b1,\u03b2)).\n- Statement. For all \u03b1,\u03b2 and all (x,y,z), one has (x,y,z)\u2208F(\u03b1,\u03b2) \u21d4 (z,y,x)\u2208F(\u03b1,\u03b2).\n- Proof. Combine S4, then S3, then S4 again. Starting with (x,y,z), S4 gives (x,\u2212z,\u2212y); S3 then gives (z,y,\u2212x); S4 again gives (z,y,x). Each step preserves membership in F(\u03b1,\u03b2), hence the equivalence.\u220e\n- Use: F(\u03b1,\u03b2) is invariant under swapping the first and third triple coordinates, a key reduction for the 2+2 ansatz.\n\nConsequences for orbits of {\u00b11}^3 under these internal symmetries\n- The group generated by S3, S4, and the swap (x,y,z)\u2194(z,y,x) (Lemma 23) preserves triple\u2011product and partitions {\u00b11}^3 into the following orbits:\n  \u2022 Product +1: O+_A = { (+++), (+\u2212\u2212), (\u2212\u2212+) } and O+_B = { (\u2212+\u2212) }.\n  \u2022 Product \u22121: O\u2212_A = { (\u2212\u2212\u2212), (++\u2212), (\u2212++) } and O\u2212_B = { (+\u2212+) }.\n  The equivalences S3/S4 connect the two 3\u2011element orbits (within each parity) and leave the 1\u2011element orbits fixed; Lemma 23 allows us to permute x and z, ensuring (+\u2212\u2212) and (\u2212\u2212+) are interchangeable inside F(\u03b1,\u03b2).\n- Reduction of F\u2011table workload: To determine F(\u03b1,\u03b2) completely, it suffices to test at most four representatives: (+++), (+\u2212\u2212), (\u2212\u2212\u2212), (+\u2212+). The remaining 4 triples follow by the above orbit relations and Lemma 21 when \u03b1=\u03b2 (central symmetry).\n\nRefined implications for the 2+2 vertex\u2011sign ansatz (Prop. 11)\n- Under the fixed coordinate convention (output.md), the 2+2 vertex\u2011sign ansatz (Lemma 10) produces, for any choice of the two \u201c+\u201d vertices on A, on each triangle an ordered triple that is either (+,\u2212,\u2212) or (\u2212,\u2212,+). The permutation (\u2212,+,\u2212) never occurs under this ansatz.\n- By Lemma 23 (x\u2194z swap) the two realized permutations are equivalent inside any fixed F(\u03b1,\u03b2). Therefore, for Prop. 11 it suffices to check a single representative:\n  \u2022 Decisive checks: (+,\u2212,\u2212)\u2208F(+,+) and (+,\u2212,\u2212)\u2208F(+,-).\n  If both hold, then by Lemma 23 the other realized permutation (\u2212,\u2212,+) also lies in F, and Prop. 11 yields a uniform |A|=4 solution, hence AP (via Lemma 2). By Cor. 9, the remaining two cases (\u2212,\u2212) and (\u2212,+) follow by triplewise negation.\n- This sharpens and justifies the \u201ctwo\u2011checks suffice\u201d reduction proposed earlier (now with full proofs relying on S3/S4/Lemma 23). Note this is weaker than assuming all three permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212) are present; the ansatz never requires (\u2212,+,\u2212).\n\nConcrete micro\u2011tests and minimal computation plan (auditable)\n- Unit tests for the new symmetries (to sanity\u2011check the IsO5 implementation and the F\u2011tables):\n  1) Verify S3/S4 on sample inputs: For a random (\u03b1,\u03b2) and triple t, confirm IsO5(\u03b1,\u03b2,t) equals IsO5(\u03b1,\u03b2,\u2212y,\u2212x,z) and IsO5(\u03b1,\u03b2,x,\u2212z,\u2212y).\n  2) Verify Lemma 23: IsO5(\u03b1,\u03b2,x,y,z)=IsO5(\u03b1,\u03b2,z,y,x).\n  3) Verify Lemma 21: IsO5(\u03b1,\u03b2,x,y,z)=IsO5(\u03b2,\u03b1,\u2212x,\u2212y,\u2212z).\n- Minimal decisive F\u2011entries to evaluate with the S\u2011oracle (output.md Lemma 20):\n  \u2022 For F(+,+): check (+,\u2212,\u2212). (+++) is known allowed (Prop. 14 for |A|=3; also C5), so (\u2212,\u2212,\u2212) follows by Lemma 21.\n  \u2022 For F(+,-): check (+,\u2212,\u2212) and retain that (+,\u2212,+) is allowed (Prop. 14). (\u2212,\u2212,\u2212) is forbidden (Lemma 13).\n  Derive the remaining two base tables by Cor. 9. Using Lemma 23, if (+,\u2212,\u2212) is allowed in a table, (\u2212,\u2212,+) is automatically allowed too.\n- Four pre\u2011existing decisive 5\u2011vector tests (still recommended):\n  \u2022 For F(+,+): (+,+,+,\u2212,\u2212) and (+,+,\u2212,\u2212,+) (the two realized permutations under w=(+,+,\u2212,\u2212)).\n  \u2022 For F(+,-): (+,\u2212,+,\u2212,\u2212) and (+,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,+).\n  Each should be non\u2011O5 for the 2+2 ansatz to succeed on the corresponding profiles.\n\nExamples and sanity data already fixed by output.md\n- F(+,+) contains (+++) and, by Lemma 21, also (\u2212\u2212\u2212).\n- F(+,-) contains (+,\u2212,+) (Prop. 14) and forbids (\u2212\u2212\u2212) (Lemma 13). The status of (+++) in F(+,-) remains to be decided by the S\u2011oracle (do not assume).\n\nWhy this is incremental, auditable progress\n- New, fully rigorous lemmas (21\u201323) extract symmetry directly from the S5 action (using only Lemmas 6, 8, 19) and sharply reduce the local enumeration:\n  \u2022 Per base table, at most four representatives need evaluation to reconstruct all 8 entries.\n  \u2022 For the 2+2 ansatz, only two total tests are decisive: (+,\u2212,\u2212)\u2208F(+,+) and (+,\u2212,\u2212)\u2208F(+,-).\n- These are immediately testable with the existing S\u2011oracle plan (output.md Lemma 20). They also supply strong unit tests to validate an implementation.\n\nObstacles and open items\n- An analytic (non\u2011computational) classification of S remains difficult; we therefore continue to rely on the small enumeration via the S\u2011oracle. The new symmetries minimize the number of required queries.\n- If either of the two decisive checks fails, the uniform 2+2 construction (Prop. 11) is unavailable. The fallback remains the tiny 2^6 CSP search with parity pruning (output.md Lemma 17) or the specific solvable subclass (Prop. 15).\n\nGaps or clarifications for output.md (do not edit now; for later integration)\n- Adding Lemmas 21\u201323 would be valuable: they formalize the internal invariances that reduce F\u2011table computation and justify the \u201ctwo\u2011checks suffice\u201d reduction for Prop. 11.\n- When the F\u2011tables are eventually archived, include a note that they are invariant under the transforms S3, S4, and x\u2194z, and that F(\u03b1,\u03b1) is centrally symmetric (Lemma 21), to aid reproducibility and debugging.\n\nNext steps for the verifier (minimal, decisive)\n1) Implement/validate the S\u2011oracle IsO5 (output.md Lemma 20). Run the unit tests in output.md and the symmetry checks listed above (S3/S4/Lemma 23/Lemma 21).\n2) Evaluate the two decisive entries: (+,\u2212,\u2212) in F(+,+) and in F(+,-). If both pass, conclude |A|=4 via Prop. 11 and AP via Lemma 2.\n3) If needed, populate the full F(+,+), F(+,-) using only the four representatives (+++), (+\u2212\u2212), (\u2212\u2212\u2212), (+\u2212+) and derive all entries by the proved symmetries. Cross\u2011check against the four P1\u2013P3 vectors.\n4) If Prop. 11 fails, run the small 2^6 search with parity pruning and archive either SAT witnesses or a minimal UNSAT certificate (which would refute AP)."}, {"prover_id": "02", "progress_md": "Status and aim\n- We keep the one\u2011point reduction and the |A|=4 six\u2011variable CSP (output.md Prop. 3). The exact O5 membership test via the pair\u2011set S (output.md Lemma 20), the \u03b5\u2011cocycle (Lemma 18), and \u03b5 on generators (Lemma 19) are now in output.md and are sufficient to implement a correct IsO5.\n- Remaining blocker: populate the two base local tables F(+,+) and F(+,-), then conclude |A|=4 either by the 2+2 construction (Prop. 11, conditional) or a tiny brute\u2011force/backtracking run.\n\nNew small, rigorous facts (auditable)\n1) Product\u2011of\u2011entries identity for O5 (debug/check aid).\n- Claim. If p\u2208O5 with witness \u03c4 in Lemma 20 (i.e., p=A_\u03c4(e_O)), then \u220f_{i=1}^5 p_i = sgn(\u03c4).\n- Proof. Writing p=flip_all_but_one(\u03b5(\u03c4), i0=\u03c4(1)), we have \u220f p_i = \u03b5_{i0}\u00b7\u220f_{i\u2260i0}(\u2212\u03b5_i) = (\u22121)^4\u220f_i \u03b5_i = \u220f_i \u03b5_i = sgn(\u03c4) by Corollary 7.\u220e\n- Why useful: A quick invariant to sanity\u2011check an S\u2011oracle and any hand\u2011computed witnesses.\n\n2) A concrete forbidden ordered triple in F(+,-).\n- Lemma EX1. For (\u03b1,\u03b2)=(+,-), the ordered triple (x,y,z)=(+,+,\u2212) is forbidden, i.e., ( +, \u2212, +, +, \u2212 ) \u2208 O5.\n- Proof. Take \u03c4=(12)(34), which is even; by direct computation (already in notes and rechecked here) \u03b5(\u03c4)=(\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,+) and i0=\u03c4(1)=2. Lemma 20 then gives p=A_\u03c4(e_O)=flip_all_but_one(\u03b5,2)=(+,\u2212,+,+,\u2212). Hence (x,y,z)=(+,+,\u2212) is not in F(+,-).\u220e\n- Why useful: This gives a certified entry of F(+,-) without any enumeration. It also provides a unit test for IsO5.\n\nExplicit \u03b5 and (\u03b5,i0) samples (for S\u2011oracle validation)\n- \u03c4=id: \u03b5=(+,+,+,+,+), i0=1; \u220f\u03b5=+.\n- \u03c4=(12): \u03b5=(+,+,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212), i0=2; \u220f\u03b5=\u2212.\n- \u03c4=(23): \u03b5=(\u2212,+,+,\u2212,\u2212), i0=1; \u220f\u03b5=\u2212.\n- \u03c4=(34): \u03b5=(\u2212,\u2212,+,+,\u2212), i0=1; \u220f\u03b5=\u2212.\n- \u03c4=(45): \u03b5=(\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,+,+), i0=1; \u220f\u03b5=\u2212.\n- \u03c4=(12)(34): \u03b5=(\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,+), i0=2; \u220f\u03b5=+.\n- \u03c4=(123): \u03b5=(+,\u2212,\u2212,+,+), i0=2; \u220f\u03b5=+.\n- \u03c4=(234): \u03b5=(+,+,\u2212,\u2212,+), i0=1; \u220f\u03b5=+.\n- \u03c4=(345): \u03b5=(+,+,+,\u2212,\u2212), i0=1; \u220f\u03b5=+.\nThese pairs should appear in S; they are also useful check\u2011points when debugging the cocycle BFS.\n\n2+2 ansatz: precise permutation usage and a weaker feasibility reduction\n- Reminder (output.md Lemma 10): with w having two + and two \u2212 and x_{ij}=w_iw_j, every triangle\u2011triple is a permutation of (+,\u2212,\u2212). Under our fixed coordinate order, for the concrete choice w=(+,+,\u2212,\u2212) on A={1,2,3,4}, one checks explicitly (as already used in notes) that:\n  \u2022 Y_1,Y_2 realize the ordered shape (\u2212,\u2212,+); Y_3,Y_4 realize (+,\u2212,\u2212).\n- Consequently, a weaker conditional than Prop. 11 suffices in practice:\n  \u2022 If for every realized pair type (\u03b1_k,\u03b2_k), both ordered shapes (+,\u2212,\u2212) and (\u2212,\u2212,+) are in F(\u03b1_k,\u03b2_k), then choosing w so that the two \u201c+\u201d are placed on the two indices k where the (\u2212,\u2212,+) shape is allowed and the other two k where (+,\u2212,\u2212) is allowed yields a satisfying assignment. This reduces to a simple feasibility check on the multiset { (\u03b1_k,\u03b2_k) : k\u2208A } and whether exactly two of them admit (\u2212,\u2212,+) (the rest admitting (+,\u2212,\u2212)).\n- Actionable use: Once F(+,+),F(+,-) are computed, form, for each ordered pair type, the set S_perm(\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2286{(+\u2212\u2212),(\u2212+\u2212),(\u2212\u2212+)} of allowed ordered shapes. If for a given one\u2011point instance there exists a 2+2 choice with exactly two k\u2019s assigned to a shape in S_perm that matches the 2+2 distribution above, the 2+2 ansatz succeeds even if the third permutation is disallowed. This is a small combinatorial check (choose which two indices carry the \u201c(\u2212,\u2212,+)\u201d triangles).\n\nBacktracking solver blueprint (deterministic, tiny) with propagation\n- Choose a starting triangle, e.g. Y_4, and branch on its allowed triple set F(p^B_4,p^C_4) (\u22648 branches). For each branch (x_{12},x_{13},x_{23}) fixed, propagate to Y_1 (which shares {x_{23}}), Y_2 (shares {x_{13}}), Y_3 (shares {x_{12}}) by intersecting their allowed sets with the corresponding fiber:\n  \u2022 Y_1 reduces F(p^B_1,p^C_1) by fixing its first of the three local variables to x_{23} (remember mapping: for Y_1 the last three coordinates are (x_{23},x_{24},x_{34})).

The decisive tool for O5 membership is now Lemma 20 (the exact S\u2011pair criterion), together with Lemmas 18\u201319 for computing \u03b5(\u03c4).\n- Goal this round: record a few rigorously proved forbidden entries for the base tables F(+,+) and F(+,-) using explicit \u03c4 and the S\u2011pair criterion, and correct an earlier pitfall about choosing i0. These small exclusions are auditable and shrink the remaining enumeration.\n\nNew, rigorous micro\u2011lemmas (using Lemma 20)\n- Lemma F1. In F(+,+), the ordered triple (x,y,z)=(-,+,+) is forbidden.\n  Why: Take \u03c4=(13). By Lemma 8, \u03b5(\u03c4)=(-,-,-,-,-). Here i0:=\u03c4(1)=3. Lemma 20 then gives A_\u03c4(e_O) with coordinates p_i=\u03b5_i for i=3 and p_i=\u2212\u03b5_i for i\u22603, namely p=(+,+,\u2212,+,+). Thus (\u2212,+,+)\u2209F(+,+). This is a concrete O5 instance in the fixed coordinate order.\n  Consequence: |{\u00b11}^3\\F(+,+)| \u2265 1. (This does not yet falsify the union\u2011bound criterion, but it is a firm, testable exclusion.)\n\n- Lemma F2 (already in output.md, restated for completeness). In F(+,-), (x,y,z)=(\u2212,\u2212,\u2212) is forbidden (Lemma 13). By Corollary 9, in F(\u2212,+), (+++) is forbidden.\n\n- Corollary F1\u2032 (by sign symmetry). In F(\u2212,\u2212), the ordered triple (+,\u2212,\u2212) is forbidden (triplewise negation of Lemma F1). Proof: Apply Corollary 9 to F1.\n  Consequence: |{\u00b11}^3\\F(\u2212,\u2212)| \u2265 1.\n\nWhy useful here\n- These entries are established via the exact S\u2011pair criterion (Lemma 20) with explicit \u03c4, hence they are rigorous and independently verifiable. They prune the base tables and sharpen expectations for the remaining entries that the verifier will compute.\n- F1 in particular shows that not all \u201ctwo\u2011plus one\u2011minus\u201d ordered patterns are allowed in F(+,+). This impacts both the union\u2011bound route (Lemma 16) and any uniform 2+2 construction that might rely on arbitrary permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212): the precise ordered membership matters.\n\nImportant correction of a subtle pitfall (auditable)\n- Earlier drafts (and my own heuristic in a past round) tried to classify O5 via the \u03b5\u2011only condition \u03a3 p_i \u03b5_i = \u22123 (or Hamming(\u2212p,\u03b5)=1). This is necessary but not sufficient; it ignores the i0 matching constraint i0=\u03c4(1) that Lemma 20 enforces. In particular, attempting to certify (+++)\u2208O5 for (\u03b1,\u03b2)=(+,-) by picking \u03b5\u2261\u22121 and i0 arbitrary is invalid. Any O5 membership must be demonstrated via an explicit \u03c4 (or via the precomputed S\u2011set), not \u03b5 alone.\n- As a concrete illustration of why i0 matters, for \u03c4=(23) one has \u03b5(\u03c4)=(\u2212,+,+,\u2212,\u2212) and i0=\u03c4(1)=1; the image A_\u03c4(e_O) is (\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,+,+), not (+,\u2212,+,+,+). The earlier shortcut that tacitly took i0=3 was incorrect; Lemma 20 clarifies the bookkeeping and prevents such slips.\n\nExamples (fully worked, for audit)\n- F1 computation in detail. \u03c4=(13) has \u03b5(\u03c4)=(-,-,-,-,-) (Lemma 8), i0=3. By Lemma 20, p=A_\u03c4(e_O) has p_3=\u03b5_3=\u2212 and p_i=\u2212\u03b5_i=+ for i\u22603, hence p=(+,+,\u2212,+,+). This matches (\u03b1,\u03b2,x,y,z)=(+,+,\u2212,+,+), so (\u2212,+,+) is excluded from F(+,+).\n- F2 remains the canonical case: for (\u03b1,\u03b2)=(+,-) and (x,y,z)=(\u2212,\u2212,\u2212), p=(+,-,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212) is the standard O5 representative.\n\nObstacles and scope\n- Proving further entries without precomputing S is delicate because of the i0 constraint. For instance, it is tempting (but not justified) to generalize F1 to say that all three permutations of a \u201ctwo\u2011plus one\u2011minus\u201d triple are forbidden in F(+,+) by conjugating \u03c4=(13); this requires tracking \u03b5 under conjugation (which is nontrivial) and verifying i0 for the same \u03c4.\n- Likewise, attempting to certify (+++)\u2209F(+,-) purely from \u03b5\u2261\u22121 fails absent an explicit \u03c4 with \u03b5(\u03c4)=\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212 and \u03c4(1)=2. This should be decided computationally via S.\n\nImpact on global strategies\n- Union\u2011bound (Lemma 16). Since we have only shown \u22651 forbidden ordered triple in F(+,+) and in F(\u2212,\u2212), the condition \u201cforbid at most one triple per table\u201d is not yet falsified. A tiny computation of the two base tables F(+,+), F(+,-) remains the quickest path to either applying Lemma 16 or to proceeding with the backtracking/SAT approach.\n- 2+2 ansatz (Prop. 11). The vertex\u2011sign method produces only (+++) and permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212). F1 shows that in the equal\u2011fixed case (++), at least one of the three permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212) is actually forbidden (the one with \u2018\u2212\u2019 in position 3). Whether the two permutations realized by a specific 2+2 choice of w are allowed is a factual question for F(+,+). Computing the full ordered table F(+,+) resolves this immediately.\n\nActionable next steps for the verifier (minimal and decisive)\n1) Build S and IsO5 exactly as in Lemma 20 (output.md); retain unit tests already listed in notes/output.\n2) Populate F(+,+), F(+,-) completely (8 entries each) under the fixed coordinate order; derive F(\u2212,\u2212), F(\u2212,+) by Corollary 9. Confirm:\n   - The new exclusion from Lemma F1: (\u2212,+,+)\u2209F(+,+).\n   - The standard exclusion from Lemma 13: (\u2212,\u2212,\u2212)\u2209F(+,-).\n3) If both complements have size \u22641, apply Cor. 16.1 to conclude the |A|=4 step and AP. Otherwise:\n   - Check whether the two ordered permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212) that arise under a 2+2 choice w (as in notes) lie in the relevant F(\u03b1,\u03b2) for each k; if yes, apply Prop. 11.\n   - If not, run the 2^6 brute\u2011force CSP per realized profile or the small backtracking solver with parity pruning (Lemma 17).\n4) Evaluate the four P1\u2013P3 5\u2011vectors from notes against IsO5; archive their status to quickly validate the 2+2 witnesses already proposed for those profiles.\n\nNotes on output.md (gaps/clarifications)\n- The new Lemma 20 (S\u2011pair criterion) is precisely the right tool; no contradictions found. The pitfalls around \u03b5\u2011only criteria are now avoided.\n- Suggestion (for later integration): Record Lemma F1 explicitly when the F\u2011tables are finalized, to document at least one ordered exclusion in F(+,+). This will help readers reproduce the non\u2011symmetry across ordered triples.\n\nSummary of incremental progress\n- Provided a new, exact O5 exclusion in the equal\u2011fixed case (Lemma F1: (\u2212,+,+)\u2209F(+,+)) with a concrete \u03c4 witness, tightening the F(+,+) table.\n- Reiterated the correct use of Lemma 20 and corrected a subtle but frequent mistake (misassigning i0), preventing false positives like the earlier (+++) claim for F(+,-).\n- Clarified how these facts intersect with union\u2011bound and the 2+2 ansatz, and distilled the next minimal computations needed to close |A|=4 and hence AP.\n"}]

Set‑up and notations (agreed baseline)
- 4‑hypertournament on finite V: equivalent to a function f:[V]^4→{±1}. For an ordered 4‑tuple (x1,x2,x3,x4) with underlying set S, we declare (x1,x2,x3,x4)∈R iff the permutation from the increasing ordering of S to (x1,…,x4) has sign equal to f(S). This satisfies (i) tuples have distinct entries, (ii) closure under even permutations, (iii) exactly one of (x1,x2,x3,x4) and (x2,x1,x3,x4) lies in R.
- For a 5‑set X, define its 5‑vector p(X)∈{±1}^X by p_x:=f(X\{x}). Isomorphisms act by p↦(ε_i(τ)·p_{τ^{-1}(i)}) with ε_i(τ)=sign of τ restricted to X\{τ^{-1}(i)}. The three isomorphism types on 5 points are denoted C5, H5, O5. For computation we may use representatives C5=(+,+,+,+,+), O5=(+,-,-,-,-), H5=(+,-,+,-,+); the orbit relation is determined by the above action (not by raw counts of pluses).

One‑point amalgamation reduction
- AP for H (class of finite 4‑hypertournaments with no induced O5) reduces to the one‑point case: Given A∈H, B=A∪{b}∈H, C=A∪{c}∈H with B∩C=A, existence of D on A∪{b,c} in H extending B and C implies full AP by iteratively adding the vertices of C\A to B.

CSP for the minimal nontrivial one‑point case |A|=4
- Fix A={1,2,3,4}, b=5, c=6. The only undetermined f‑values are the six cross 4‑sets X_{ij}={i,j,5,6} (1≤i<j≤4). Let variables x_{ij}:=f(X_{ij})∈{±1}.
- The only potentially new 5‑sets are Y_k:={5,6}∪(A\{k}) for k∈{1,2,3,4}. For each k, p(Y_k) has two fixed coordinates: p missing 6 equals p^B_k:=f_B({5}∪(A\{k})), and p missing 5 equals p^C_k:=f_C({6}∪(A\{k})); and three variable coordinates drawn from {x_{ij}} on the three pairs inside A\{k}:
  • Y_1 depends on {x_{23},x_{24},x_{34}}
  • Y_2 depends on {x_{13},x_{14},x_{34}}
  • Y_3 depends on {x_{12},x_{14},x_{24}}
  • Y_4 depends on {x_{12},x_{13},x_{23}}.
- Constraint: For each k, p(Y_k) must not lie in the O5‑orbit. This is the complete constraint system for the one‑point amalgam over A of size 4.

Base sizes |A|≤2 and |A|=3
- |A|≤2: There are no 5‑sets Y; any assignment to cross 4‑sets works, so one‑point amalgamation always succeeds.
- |A|=3: There is exactly one 5‑set Y=A∪{b,c}, with two fixed coordinates (those missing b and c) and three unknowns (those missing each a∈A). We expect (and plan to verify computationally) that for every (α,β)∈{±1}^2 at least one of the 8 assignments to the three unknowns avoids the O5 orbit. This settles one‑point amalgamation at size 3 once verified.

Switching: what it does and what it does not
- For ε:V→{±1}, define f^ε(S):=(∏_{v∈S}ε(v))·f(S). Then f^ε encodes another 4‑hypertournament.
- Caution: For a fixed 5‑set X, switching at a vertex v∈X flips the four coordinates of p(X) corresponding to the 4‑sets that contain v and leaves the coordinate “missing v” unchanged. This can change the 5‑type: e.g., (+,-,-,-,-) (an O5 representative) switches at the ‘+’ vertex to (+,+,+,+,+) (a C5 representative). Thus switching is not a valid normalization trick for fixed one‑point data (B,C) in H.

Computational plan (to settle |A|=3 and |A|=4)
- Step A: Compute the O5 orbit via the S5 action above; implement IsO5(p).
- Step B (|A|=3): For each (α,β), enumerate the 8 triples, test IsO5, and record that at least one choice avoids O5.
- Step C (|A|=4): Enumerate compatible (B,C) (both of type C5 or H5, agreeing on f(A)), form p^B_k,p^C_k (k=1..4), and brute‑force the 2^6 choices of x_{ij}, rejecting any assignment for which some Y_k is O5. Record either a counterexample or certify all cases pass.
- Precompute F(α,β)⊆{±1}^3: the allowed triples for a 5‑set with given two fixed coordinates. Then the |A|=4 CSP checks membership of the four triangle‑triples in F(p^B_k,p^C_k).

Constructive ansatz to test
- Try x_{ij}=w_iw_j with w_i:=p^B_i·p^C_i for i∈A. For T={i,j,k} this gives a triple (w_iw_j,w_iw_k,w_jw_k) of product +1. If this never yields O5 for any (p^B_k,p^C_k), it provides a uniform construction for all |A| (worth testing; not proved).
Addendum: explicit S5 action, corrections, and computation plan

1) Explicit ε-formula for the S5 action (implementation aid)
For τ ∈ S5 and i ∈ {1,…,5}, write j := τ^{-1}(i) and define
c_j(τ) := |{k<j : τ(k) > τ(j)}| + |{k>j : τ(k) < τ(j)}|.
Then the sign multiplier in the action p′_i = ε_i(τ)·p_{τ^{-1}(i)} equals
ε_i(τ) = sgn(τ)·(−1)^{c_j(τ)}.
Sketch of justification: Let τ′ be the induced bijection from [5]\{j} to [5]\{i}. Its inversion count is inv(τ′) = inv(τ) − c_j(τ) because the inversions of τ decompose into those not involving j (which biject with the inversions of τ′) and those involving j (counted by c_j). Hence sgn(τ′) = (−1)^{inv(τ′)} = (−1)^{inv(τ)−c_j} = sgn(τ)·(−1)^{c_j}. By definition ε_i(τ) = sgn(τ′). A immediate corollary is the product identity ∏_{i=1}^5 ε_i(τ) = sgn(τ), since Σ_j c_j(τ) = 2·inv(τ).

Practical note: This eliminates ambiguity about ε and supports a robust IsO5 enumerator.

2) Correction to the “fully aligned” claim
The statement “If p^B_k = p^C_k for all k then setting all x_{ij}=δ makes p(Y_k) constant δ for all k” is false unless the common pattern (p^B_k)_{k∈A} is itself constant with value δ. Counterexample: take p^B=p^C=(+,+,−,+) and δ=+. Then for k=3 the fixed coordinates are (−,−) while the three variables are +, so p(Y_3) is not constant. A correct (weaker) statement is: if p^B_k = p^C_k = δ for all k, then x_{ij}≡δ makes every p(Y_k) constant δ, hence non-O5.

3) F(α,β) tables: compute all four cases
Define F(α,β) ⊆ {±1}^3 as the set of triples (x,y,z) for which p=(α,β,x,y,z) is non-O5. Do not assume F(+,+)=F(−,−) or F(+,-)=F(−,+) a priori; compute all four cases. This is an 8×4=32-evaluation task. Record each F(α,β) explicitly along with any observed symmetries (e.g., invariance under permuting x,y,z).

Consequence: |A|=3 reduces to checking that for each (α,β) there exists at least one triple in F(α,β). Archive one such triple per case.

4) |A|=4 CSP protocol (profiles and ansatz)
- Use the already-recorded CSP with variables x_{ij} on the six edges of K4 and four constraints Y_k. For any concrete pair (B,C) over A with B∩C=A and both omitting O5, determine the four pairs (p^B_k,p^C_k) and require the corresponding triangle-triple to lie in F(p^B_k,p^C_k).
- Profiles to test early:
  • P1: p^B≡+, p^C≡+. The corrected alignment lemma (constant case) gives the assignment x_{ij}≡+.
  • P2: p^B≡+, p^C≡−. Try the perfect-matching assignment x_{12}=x_{34}=+, others −; check all four Y_k via IsO5.
  • P3: p^B≡+, p^C drawn from an H5 labeling consistent on A; try ansatz x_{ij}=w_i w_j with w_i=p^B_i p^C_i.
  • P4: both sides H5 aligned on A; by the corrected alignment lemma with δ=+, x_{ij}≡+ works if the common 4-bit pattern on A is constant +.
- Constructive ansatz: x_{ij}:=w_i w_j where w_i:=p^B_i p^C_i. For T={i,j,k}, the triple is (w_i w_j, w_i w_k, w_j w_k) with product +1. Test this uniformly across enumerated cases; if it always avoids O5, it suggests a uniform construction for general |A|.

5) Unit tests for IsO5
- p=(+,+,+,+,+) should classify non-O5; p=(+,−,−,−,−) should classify O5; p=(+,−,+,−,+) should classify non-O5 (H5). Also verify that for a transposition τ, ∏_i p′_i flips sign (product identity) and that orbit membership is invariant under the action.

6) Checklist for the next round
- Implement IsO5 with the ε-formula; report the size of the O5 orbit found by enumeration.
- Compute and list F(α,β) for all four cases; confirm |A|=3.
- Run the |A|=4 CSP on P1–P4 first, then extend to representatives modulo S4 on A; archive satisfying/unsatisfying assignments.
- Report whether the ansatz x_{ij}=w_i w_j succeeds in all tested instances.
Additional clarifications, small lemmas, and symmetry for the 5-vector orbit

1) Semantics of the fixed bits p^B_k and p^C_k (|A|=4)
For B on A∪{b} and k∈A, define p^B_k:=f_B({b}∪(A\{k})). On the 5-set A∪{b}, the 5-vector p has entries p_x=f((A∪{b})\{x}). Thus for k∈A, p^B_k coincides with the coordinate “missing k” of p on A∪{b}: it records whether the increasing 4-tuple on {b}∪(A\{k}) is in R_B. Analogously p^C_k is the coordinate “missing k” of the 5-vector on A∪{c}.

2) Necessary local exclusions in the opposite-fixed case (rigorous justification)
- With (α,β,x,y,z)=(+;−;−,−,−) we obtain the canonical O5 representative; hence this triple is forbidden for (α,β)=(+,-).
- By central symmetry of the O5 orbit (see 4) below), (−;+;+,+,+) is also O5; hence forbidden for (α,β)=(−,+).
These give immediate unit tests for any IsO5 implementation and constraints for F(+,-) and F(−,+).

3) Edge/triangle viewpoint and the structured ansatz
- Place the six variables x_{ij} on the edges of K4 on A. The constraint Y_k uses the triangle on T=A\{k}.
- Structured ansatz: pick w_i∈{±1} on the vertices and set x_{ij}:=w_i w_j. For any triangle {i,j,k}, the triple (w_iw_j,w_iw_k,w_jw_k) has product +1, realizing exactly (+++),(+−−),(−+−),(−−+).

4) Central symmetry of the O5 orbit and a consequence for F(α,β)
There exists τ∈S5, e.g. τ=(13), with ε_i(τ)=−1 for all i (check via Lemma 6: c_j(τ) is even for every j and sgn(τ)=−1). Hence for any 5-vector p, p∈O5 iff −p∈O5. As a consequence, for the local tables F(α,β)⊆{±1}^3 (defined by p=(α,β,x,y,z) non-O5), one has
F(−α,−β) = { (−x,−y,−z) : (x,y,z)∈F(α,β) }.
Therefore it suffices to compute F(+,+) and F(+,-); the other two cases follow by triplewise negation. Do not assume any further symmetries (e.g., permutations of x,y,z or F(+,-)=F(−,+)) without verification.

5) On classifying |A|=4 instances
The constraint at each k depends on the ordered pair (p^B_k,p^C_k)∈{++,−−,+−,−+}. Reduction to the pure eq/opp pattern E={k: p^B_k=p^C_k} is insufficient unless one proves F(+,+)=F(−,−) and F(+,-)=F(−,+). Use the full type-vector in {++,−−,+−,−+}^A. By 4), it is enough to compute and store F(+,+), F(+,-), and infer the other two by negation.

6) Implementation checklist (precise conventions)
- Fix, once and for all, an ordering of the five vertices of each Y_k with the first two positions corresponding to the coordinates “missing c” and “missing b”, respectively, and the last three to the vertices of A\{k} in increasing order. Use the same convention for constructing p=(α,β,x,y,z) when populating F(α,β).
- Implement IsO5 via Lemma 6. Unit tests: (+,+,+,+,+) is non-O5; (+,−,−,−,−) is O5; (+,−,+,−,+) is non-O5. Report the orbit size and verify closure under the action.
- Compute F(+,+), F(+,-); obtain F(−,−), F(−,+) by triplewise negation. Conclude |A|=3 by listing one admissible triple for each (α,β).
- For |A|=4, enumerate realizable type-vectors from actual pairs (B,C) (both C5/H5, agreeing on A), and brute-force 2^6 assignments to x_{ij}. Archive SAT witnesses or UNSAT certificates. Test the ansatz x_{ij}=w_i w_j with w_i=p^B_i p^C_i across the same cases.

These additions lock down the symmetry that underlies Claim N1, correct the eq/opp reduction, and make the forthcoming computations unambiguous and reusable.
Uniform 2+2− assignment and a corrected conditional reduction for |A|=4

Ordering convention for local F-tables
- For any 5-set Y_k={b,c}∪(A\{k}) with A={1,2,3,4} and i<j<ℓ the increasing order on A\{k}, we use the coordinate order
  p(Y_k) = (p_{\text{missing }c}, p_{\text{missing }b}, p_{\text{missing }i}, p_{\text{missing }j}, p_{\text{missing }\ell}).
- With this convention, F(α,β)⊆{±1}^3 is the set of ordered triples (x,y,z) such that (α,β,x,y,z) is non-O5.

- Let w_i∈{±1} (i∈A) have exactly two + and two −, and set x_{ij}:=w_i w_j. For each k, the triple (x,y,z) contributed by the three edges inside A\{k} is, up to permutation of its three coordinates, of the form (+,−,−).
- Proof. If k is from the + vertices, then A\{k} contains {+,−,−}; the pairwise products are (−,−,+). If k is from the − vertices, then A\{k} contains {+, +, −}; the pairwise products are (+,−,−). In either case the unordered triple has one + and two −. The order within (x,y,z) depends on the fixed coordinate convention but is a permutation of (+,−,−). ∎

Corrected conditional reduction for |A|=4
- Conditional Proposition (uniform 2+2 ansatz). Fix the above ordering convention. Suppose that for each (α,β)∈{++, +−, −+, −−}, all three permutations of (+,−,−) lie in F(α,β). Then for every one-point instance over |A|=4 there exists an amalgam D in H obtained by the uniform assignment x_{ij}=w_i w_j with some w having exactly two + and two − on A.
  • Proof. By Lemma A, for every k the ordered triple on Y_k is a permutation of (+,−,−). By hypothesis, this ordered triple is in F(p^B_k,p^C_k) for each k, hence none of the four Y_k is O5, and D∈H. ∎
- Unconditional subcase (equal-constant fixed pairs). If (p^B_k,p^C_k)=(δ,δ) for all k (with δ∈{±1}), then the constant assignment x_{ij}≡δ makes every p(Y_k) equal to (δ,δ,δ,δ,δ), which is ±C5 and therefore non-O5. Hence an amalgam exists in this subcase.

Hard local exclusion in the opposite-fixed case
- For (α,β)=(+,-), the triple (−,−,−) is forbidden: p=(+,-,−,−,−) is the canonical O5 representative. By central symmetry of the S5 action, (+++) is forbidden for (α,β)=(−,+) as well. These serve as unit checks for IsO5 and constraints in populating F.

Notes on earlier claims
- The claim “(+++) is forbidden in F(+,-)” has not been proved. The argument via “flipping one coordinate” is not valid under the S5 signed action. Treat this as a computational check when populating F.

Computational checklist (precise and minimal)
1) Implement IsO5 via Lemma 6; unit tests: (+,+,+,+,+) non-O5; (+,−,−,−,−) O5; (+,−,+,−,+) non-O5. Report the size of the O5 orbit and closure under the action.
2) Compute F(+,+) and F(+,-) completely (8 triples each) under the above ordering; use Corollary 9 to derive F(−,−) and F(−,+) by triplewise negation. Do not assume S3-invariance.
3) Test the 12 memberships: for each (α,β)∈{++, +−, −+, −−}, verify that all three permutations of (+,−,−) lie in F(α,β).
4) If step 3 passes, conclude by the conditional proposition that the |A|=4 one-point step is uniformly solvable by a 2+2 ansatz; with Lemma 2 this yields AP.
5) If step 3 fails, run the 2^6 CSP for the offending type-profile to search for a different satisfying assignment or produce an UNSAT certificate (listing, for each assignment, a Y_k showing O5).

Implementation detail retained: the structured ansatz yields triangle triples of product +1, hence it can never realize (−,+,+) or (−,−,−). Keep this in mind when interpreting F-tables and debugging assignments.
Updates: explicit |A|=3 solution, concrete |A|=4 tests, and a solvable subclass

Coordinate convention reminder (used below)
- For Y_k={b,c}∪(A\{k}) with A={1,2,3,4} and i<j<ℓ the increasing order on A\{k}, we encode
  p(Y_k) = (p_{missing c}, p_{missing b}, p_{missing i}, p_{missing j}, p_{missing ℓ}).
- Mapping of the last three coordinates to edge variables on K4[A]:
  • p_{missing i} = x_{jℓ},  p_{missing j} = x_{iℓ},  p_{missing ℓ} = x_{ij}.

|A|=3 one‑point amalgamation solved (constructive)
- Let A have size 3. For Y=A∪{b,c} write p(Y)=(α,β,x,y,z) in the above order, where α is fixed by B (missing c), β by C (missing b), and x,y,z are the cross 4‑sets. The following choices always avoid O5:
  • (α,β)=(+,+): take (x,y,z)=(+,+,+) → p(Y)=(+,+,+,+,+)=C5.
  • (α,β)=(−,−): take (x,y,z)=(−,−,−) → p(Y)=(−,−,−,−,−)=−C5.
  • (α,β)=(+,-): take (x,y,z)=(+,-,+) → p(Y)=(+,-,+,-,+)=H5.
  • (α,β)=(−,+): take (x,y,z)=(−,+,−) → p(Y)=(−,+,−,+,−)=−H5.
  Hence the one‑point extension over |A|=3 always exists in H.

Concrete |A|=4 test profiles for the 2+2 ansatz (w=(+,+,−,−), x_{ij}=w_i w_j)
- Triangles (Y_k):
  • k=1: (x_{23},x_{24},x_{34})=(−,−,+) → p(Y_1)=(p^B_1,p^C_1,−,−,+).
  • k=2: (x_{13},x_{14},x_{34})=(−,−,+) → p(Y_2)=(p^B_2,p^C_2,−,−,+).
  • k=3: (x_{12},x_{14},x_{24})=(+,-,−) → p(Y_3)=(p^B_3,p^C_3,+,−,−).
  • k=4: (x_{12},x_{13},x_{23})=(+,-,−) → p(Y_4)=(p^B_4,p^C_4,+,−,−).
- Profiles to check via IsO5 (the first two coordinates are specialized as follows):
  • P1: p^B≡+, p^C≡+ → test (+,+,−,−,+) and (+,+,+,−,−).
  • P2: p^B≡+, p^C≡− → test (+,−,−,−,+) and (+,−,+,−,−).
  • P3: p^B≡+, p^C=(+,-,+,-) (aligned H5 on A∪{c}) → same two vectors as P2.
A single IsO5 pass on these four vectors settles P1–P3 for the 2+2 ansatz.

A solvable subclass for |A|=4 via a “local H5 witness” pattern
- Prescribe for each k a local triple (x_{jℓ}, x_{iℓ}, x_{ij}) = (α_k, β_k, α_k), where (α_k,β_k)=(p^B_k,p^C_k) and i<j<ℓ enumerate A\{k}.
- Shared‑edge consistency forces:
  • α_1=α_2=α_3=α_4;  β_1=α_3;  β_4=α_2;  β_2=β_3.
- If the given one‑point data (B,C) satisfy these equalities, then for each k we get p(Y_k)=(α_k,β_k,α_k,β_k,α_k), which is ±C5 if α_k=β_k, else ±H5. Hence an amalgam exists for this subclass.

Caveat on the LLL heuristic
- The symmetric LLL condition e·p·(d+1)≤1 with d=3 would require p≤1/(4e)≈0.091. If |{±1}^3\F(α,β)|≤1 then p=1/8≈0.125, which does not meet the symmetric bound. Treat any LLL‑based argument as heuristic unless we deploy a sharper criterion tailored to our dependency graph.

Actionable checklist (minimal computation to unblock |A|=4)
1) Implement IsO5 (Lemma 6), run unit tests, and report the O5 orbit size.
2) Test the four 5‑vectors from P1–P3 above.
3) Compute F(+,+) and F(+,-) fully (8 triples each) under the fixed ordering; obtain the other two by triplewise negation. Archive the tables.
4) If all permutations of (+,−,−) lie in each F(α,β), invoke Proposition 11 (uniform 2+2). Otherwise, brute‑force the 2^6 CSP per realized 4‑type profile and record SAT witnesses or an UNSAT certificate.
New rigorous tools and corrections (to be used going forward)

1) Union‑bound feasibility for the |A|=4 CSP
- Statement. In the |A|=4 CSP with six edge variables x_{ij} and four triangle constraints Y_k, if for each k the local table F(p^B_k,p^C_k) forbids at most one ordered triple (i.e., |{±1}^3\F(p^B_k,p^C_k)| ≤ 1), then there exists a satisfying global assignment.
- Reason. Each forbidden triple for a fixed triangle rules out exactly 2^3 global assignments (the other 3 edges are free). With at most one forbidden triple per triangle, at most 4·2^3=32 of the 64 assignments are excluded. Hence at least 32 assignments remain.
- Consequence. If a small computation confirms |{±1}^3\F(+,+)| ≤ 1 and |{±1}^3\F(+,-)| ≤ 1 (the other two cases follow by triplewise negation; Cor. 9), the |A|=4 step follows immediately without any 6‑variable search.

2) Specialization of the S5 action to the O5 representative (implementation aid)
- For e_O=(+,-,-,-,-) and τ∈S5 with ε(τ)=(ε_1,…,ε_5), let i0:=τ(1). Then the image p′ under the signed action satisfies p′_i = ε_i if i=i0 and p′_i = −ε_i otherwise. Equivalently, p′ is obtained from ε by flipping all coordinates except i0. Thus p∈O5 iff ∃ε∈E:={ε(τ):τ∈S5} and i0 with p_i=−ε_i for i≠i0 and p_{i0}=ε_{i0}.
- Note. This enables a very compact IsO5: precompute E (120 evaluations) and check the 5·|E| candidates.

3) Parity invariant across the four triangles
- For any assignment x_{ij}∈{±1}, the product of the triangle‑products over the four Y_k equals +1. Equivalently, an odd number of triangles cannot have triple product −1. Reason: each x_{ij} appears in exactly two triangle‑products.

4) Distribution of triangle triples under vertex‑sign assignments
- If x_{ij}=w_i w_j with w∈{±1}^A, then on any triangle the triple is either (+++) (when the three w are equal) or a permutation of (+,−,−) (otherwise). In particular: 4+/0− (or 0+/4−) yields four (+++); 3+/1− (or 1+/3−) yields exactly one (+++); 2+/2− yields no (+++) and all four triangles are permutations of (+,−,−).

Corrections to prior claims
- False: “If T_B=C5 then (p^B_k)_{k∈A} is constant; if T_B=H5 then it is 2+2.” Counterexample: for a C5 5‑set, the 5‑vector equals ε(τ) for some τ; e.g., τ=(12) gives ε=(+,+,−,−,−), which is not constant on A. Do not use this classification to prune cases.
- Unproved (and currently unknown): (+++)∉F(+,-). The argument that tried to force this from Lemma 8 incorrectly treats the free index i0. We keep only the rigorously proved exclusion (---)∉F(+,-) (output.md Lemma 13). The status of (+++) in F(+,-) must be decided computationally.

Coordinate convention (reminder)
- For Y_k={b,c}∪(A\{k}) with A={1,2,3,4} and i<j<ℓ the increasing order on A\{k}, we encode p(Y_k)=(p_{missing c}, p_{missing b}, p_{missing i}, p_{missing j}, p_{missing ℓ}), with p_{missing i}=x_{jℓ}, p_{missing j}=x_{iℓ}, p_{missing ℓ}=x_{ij}.

Actionable checklist (minimal computation to unblock |A|=4)
- Implement IsO5 using Lemma 6; validate unit tests: (+,+,+,+,+) ∉O5; (+,−,−,−,−) ∈O5; (+,−,+,−,+) ∉O5. Also verify the sample ε(τ) values listed in prior notes.
- Compute F(+,+) and F(+,-) completely (8 triples each) under the fixed coordinate order; derive F(−,−), F(−,+) by triplewise negation. Report sizes and explicit complements.
- If both complements have size ≤1, conclude |A|=4 by the union‑bound lemma and hence AP via Lemma 2. If, stronger, both F tables are exactly “triple product +1,” record the uniform construction x_{ij}=w_i w_j and close.
- If not, test whether all permutations of (+,−,−) lie in F(+,+) and F(+,-); if yes, apply Proposition 11 (uniform 2+2). Otherwise brute‑force the 2^6 CSP on the realized profiles, using the parity invariant to prune, and archive SAT/UNSAT witnesses.
O5 membership: exact S‑criterion vs. ε‑only heuristics
- Exact criterion (to be used for IsO5). Let e_O=(+,-,-,-,-), and define the pair‑set
  S := { (ε(τ), i0=τ(1)) : τ ∈ S_5 },
  where ε(τ) is as in Lemma 6. Then for p∈{±1}^5,
  p ∈ O5 ⇔ ∃(ε,i0)∈S such that p_i = ε_i for i=i0 and p_i = −ε_i for i≠i0.
  Equivalently, p is obtained from ε by “flipping all coordinates except i0,” with (ε,i0) realized by the same τ. This is the specialization of the action to e_O and is both necessary and sufficient.

- ε‑only heuristics (use with caution). Two convenient tests are often useful but are not sufficient on their own:
  • Hamming‑1: Hamming(−p, ε) = 1 for some ε ∈ E := {ε(τ) : τ∈S_5}.
  • Inner‑product −3: Σ_i p_i ε_i = −3 for some ε∈E (equivalently to Hamming‑1).
  These conditions are necessary for O5 membership but not sufficient unless the unique discrepancy index i0 is consistent with i0=τ(1) for the same τ realizing ε. Hence, they can give false positives. Always validate by checking the pair (ε,i0)∈S.

ε‑cocycle and generators (implementation aids)
- Cocycle identity. For σ,τ∈S_5 and i∈[5]:
  ε_i(σ∘τ) = ε_i(σ) · ε_{σ^{-1}(i)}(τ).
  This follows by composing the signed actions (Lemma 6) and comparing with the action of σ∘τ.

- Adjacent transpositions. For s_k=(k k+1) (k=1,2,3,4),
  ε(s_k) has + at positions k and k+1 and − elsewhere.
  This is a direct computation from Lemma 6 via the c_j counts and is a robust generator datum for building E and S by BFS on the Cayley graph of S_5.

Practical S‑oracle blueprint
- Build S by BFS over right‑multiplication by s_k, storing for each state (τ) the pair (ε(τ), i0=τ(1)). Update via the cocycle and track i0′=τ(s_k(1)). Verify: |S|=120; sample ε values on generators; product identity ∏_i ε_i(τ)=sgn(τ) (Cor. 7).
- IsO5(p): return true iff ∃(ε,i0)∈S with p_i=ε_i for i=i0 and p_i=−ε_i otherwise.

Local F‑tables and the |A|=4 plan
- Compute F(+,+) and F(+,-) by 8 exact IsO5 calls each on p=(α,β,x,y,z) under the fixed coordinate order (reminder in output.md). Derive F(−,−) and F(−,+) by triplewise negation (Cor. 9). Confirm the |A|=3 witnesses (Proposition 14) show up as allowed entries in the appropriate tables.
- Decision routes:
  • If |{±1}^3\F(+,+)| ≤ 1 and |{±1}^3\F(+,-)| ≤ 1, conclude |A|=4 by Cor. 16.1.
  • If, stronger, all three permutations of (+,−,−) lie in F(+,+) and F(+,-), conclude by Proposition 11 (uniform 2+2).
  • Otherwise, run the 2^6 CSP per realized profile, pruning by the parity invariant (Lemma 17).

Unit checks for the oracle
- Mandatory: (+,−,−,−,−) ∈ O5; (+,+,+,+,+) ∉ O5; (+,−,+,−,+) ∉ O5. Also verify ε(s_k) as above and closure properties from Lemma 6/Cor. 7.

Caveat
- Do not treat “ε only” rules (Hamming‑1 or inner‑product −3) as definitive. They are helpful filters but must be validated against the S‑pair constraint to avoid false positives.

Current output.md (if any):
Proposition 1 (Orientation function model).
For a finite set V, giving a 4‑hypertournament structure (V,R) satisfying: (i) all tuples in R have distinct entries; (ii) R is closed under even permutations of coordinates; (iii) for every 4‑tuple of distinct vertices (x1,x2,x3,x4), exactly one of (x1,x2,x3,x4) and (x2,x1,x3,x4) lies in R; is equivalent to giving an arbitrary function f:[V]^4→{±1}.
Proof. Given f, declare (x1,x2,x3,x4)∈R iff the permutation from the increasing ordering of S={x1,x2,x3,x4} to (x1,…,x4) has sign equal to f(S). This satisfies (i)–(iii) by construction. Conversely, given R with (i)–(iii), fix any 4‑set S and any increasing ordering s of S. By (iii), exactly one of s and its swap lies in R; define f(S)=+1 if s∈R and f(S)=−1 otherwise. By (ii) and (iii), membership of any ordered tuple from S depends only on the parity relative to s, so f is well defined and recovers R. ∎

Lemma 2 (One‑point amalgamation suffices for AP in H).
Let H be the class of finite 4‑hypertournaments omitting O5. Suppose that whenever A∈H and B=A∪{b}∈H and C=A∪{c}∈H with B∩C=A, there exists D∈H on A∪{b,c} extending both B and C. Then H has the amalgamation property.
Proof. Given B0,B1∈H over A, enumerate C\A as c1,…,ck and set A0:=A. Inductively, amalgamate Bi with Ai∪{ci} over Ai to obtain Bi+1 on Ai+1:=Ai∪{ci}. At each step, by hypothesis, all 5‑sets involving the new vertex ci avoid O5, and previously constructed parts are unchanged. After k steps we obtain an amalgam D∈H of B0 and C over A. ∎

Proposition 3 (CSP formulation of the |A|=4 one‑point step).
Let A={1,2,3,4}, b, c new. Given B on A∪{b} and C on A∪{c} in H that agree on A, any amalgam D on A∪{b,c} is determined on new 4‑sets by the six values x_{ij}:=f({i,j,b,c}) (1≤i<j≤4). The only new 5‑sets are Y_k:={b,c}∪(A\{k}) for k=1,2,3,4. Writing p^B_k:=f_B({b}∪(A\{k})) and p^C_k:=f_C({c}∪(A\{k})), the 5‑vector p(Y_k) has two fixed coordinates (missing c gives p^B_k; missing b gives p^C_k) and three coordinates equal to the x_{ij} for {i,j}⊂A\{k}. D∈H iff for each k, p(Y_k) is not in the O5 orbit.
Proof. All 4‑sets contained in B or C are already fixed. The only 4‑sets not contained in B or C are precisely the six X_{ij}={i,j,b,c}. The only new 5‑subsets of A∪{b,c} (relative to B and C) are those that contain both b and c; there are exactly four, the Y_k. Their p‑vectors depend on the listed values. Avoidance of O5 on all 5‑sets is thus equivalent to the stated four constraints. ∎

Corollary 4 (Trivial one‑point cases |A|≤2).
If |A|≤2, then one‑point amalgamation always succeeds in H.
Proof. When |A|≤2 there are no 3‑subsets of A, hence no 5‑sets of the form {b,c}∪T with T⊂A of size 3. Thus there are no new 5‑set constraints; any assignment to cross 4‑sets yields an amalgam in H. ∎

Fact 5 (Switching yields a 4‑hypertournament but may change 5‑types).
For ε:V→{±1}, define f^ε(S):=(∏_{v∈S}ε(v))·f(S). Then f^ε encodes a 4‑hypertournament. However, for a fixed 5‑set X, switching at v∈X flips the four coordinates of p(X) corresponding to 4‑sets containing v and leaves the coordinate “missing v” unchanged; this can change the isomorphism type on X (e.g., an O5 representative (+,-,-,-,-) switches at its ‘+’ vertex to (+,+,+,+,+), a C5 representative). ∎
Lemma 6 (Explicit formula for the S5 action on 5-vectors).
Let X be a 5-set equipped with an increasing labeling {1,2,3,4,5}. For τ∈S5 and i∈{1,…,5}, write j:=τ^{-1}(i) and define
c_j(τ) := |{k<j : τ(k) > τ(j)}| + |{k>j : τ(k) < τ(j)}|.
In the isomorphism action on p∈{±1}^X given by p′_i = ε_i(τ)·p_{τ^{-1}(i)}, the sign factor is
ε_i(τ) = sgn(τ)·(−1)^{c_j(τ)}.

Proof. Let τ′ be the induced bijection from [5]\{j} to [5]\{i}, obtained by deleting position j in the domain and value i in the codomain. By definition, ε_i(τ)=sgn(τ′). The inversions of τ split into two disjoint families: those not involving j (which correspond bijectively to inversions of τ′) and those involving j, whose number is c_j(τ) by definition. Hence inv(τ)=inv(τ′)+c_j(τ), so sgn(τ)= (−1)^{inv(τ)} = (−1)^{inv(τ′)+c_j(τ)} = sgn(τ′)·(−1)^{c_j(τ)} = ε_i(τ)·(−1)^{c_j(τ)}. Rearranging gives the claimed formula. ∎

Corollary 7 (Product identity for ε-factors).
For τ∈S5, one has ∏_{i=1}^5 ε_i(τ) = sgn(τ).

Proof. Using ε_i(τ) = sgn(τ)·(−1)^{c_{τ^{-1}(i)}(τ)} and the fact that each inversion contributes 1 to c_a and 1 to c_b, we have Σ_{j=1}^5 c_j(τ) = 2·inv(τ). Therefore ∏_{i=1}^5 ε_i(τ) = sgn(τ)^5 · (−1)^{Σ_j c_j(τ)} = sgn(τ)·(−1)^{2·inv(τ)} = sgn(τ). ∎
Lemma 8 (Central symmetry of the O5 orbit).
There exists τ∈S5 with ε_i(τ)=−1 for all i. In particular, for any 5-vector p one has p∈O5 if and only if −p∈O5. Thus the O5 orbit is closed under global sign reversal.

Proof. Take τ=(13) in one-line notation [3,2,1,4,5]. By Lemma 6, for j:=τ^{-1}(i), ε_i(τ)=sgn(τ)·(−1)^{c_j(τ)}. A direct count gives c_1(τ)=c_2(τ)=c_3(τ)=2 and c_4(τ)=c_5(τ)=0, so c_j(τ) is even for all j. Since sgn(τ)=−1, we get ε_i(τ)=−1 for every i. If q is in the O5 orbit, then so is R_τ(q)=−q∘τ^{−1}. As σ ranges over S5, the set {−R_σ(e1)} equals {R_{τσ}(e1):σ∈S5}, hence −O5=O5. ∎

Corollary 9 (Sign-flip symmetry for local tables F).
For F(α,β)⊆{±1}^3 defined by: (x,y,z)∈F(α,β) iff (α,β,x,y,z) is non-O5, one has
F(−α,−β) = { (−x,−y,−z) : (x,y,z)∈F(α,β) }.

Proof. (α,β,x,y,z) is non-O5 iff its global negation (−α,−β,−x,−y,−z) is non-O5 by Lemma 8. This is exactly the stated correspondence. ∎
Lemma 10 (2+2 vertex signs induce (+−−)-type on every triangle).
Let A={1,2,3,4} and choose w_i∈{±1} with exactly two plus and two minus. Define x_{ij}:=w_i w_j for 1≤i<j≤4. For each k∈A, on the triangle induced by A\{k} the ordered triple of edge-variables (x,y,z) (in any fixed coordinate convention) is a permutation of (+,−,−).

Proof. If k is one of the + vertices, then A\{k} contains one + and two −; the three pairwise products are (−,−,+). If k is one of the − vertices, then A\{k} contains two + and one −; the three pairwise products are (+,−,−). Thus in either case the unordered triple has signs {+ , − , −}. The ordering of (x,y,z) depends on the fixed convention but is a permutation of (+,−,−). ∎

Proposition 11 (Conditional |A|=4 amalgamation via a uniform 2+2 ansatz).
Fix a consistent ordering convention for the last three coordinates in the definition of F(α,β) (e.g., by increasing order of the three vertices in A\{k}). Suppose that for each (α,β)∈{++, +−, −+, −−}, all three permutations of (+,−,−) belong to F(α,β). Then for every one-point diagram over |A|=4 there exists an amalgam D∈H obtained by setting x_{ij}=w_i w_j for some choice of w with exactly two + and two − on A.

Proof. Choose any w with exactly two + and two − on A and set x_{ij}=w_i w_j. By Lemma 10, for each k the ordered triple contributed by the three edges in A\{k} is a permutation of (+,−,−). By hypothesis, this ordered triple lies in F(p^B_k,p^C_k) for every k, so no Y_k is of type O5. Therefore the resulting structure on A∪{b,c} is in H and extends both B and C. ∎

Proposition 12 (Equal-constant fixed pairs are solvable by a constant assignment).
In the |A|=4 one-point amalgamation problem, if (p^B_k,p^C_k)=(δ,δ) for all k∈A with a fixed δ∈{±1}, then there exists an amalgam D∈H obtained by setting x_{ij}≡δ.

Proof. With this assignment, for each k the 5-vector p(Y_k) equals (δ,δ,δ,δ,δ), which is ±C5. Since ±C5 is not in the O5 orbit, each Y_k is non-O5 and the amalgam lies in H. ∎

Lemma 13 (A hard local exclusion in the opposite-fixed case).
For (α,β)=(+,-), the triple (−,−,−) is forbidden: (x,y,z)=(−,−,−)∉F(+,-). Symmetrically, for (α,β)=(−,+), (+++)∉F(−,+).

Proof. For (α,β)=(+,-) and (x,y,z)=(−,−,−) one has p=(+,-,−,−,−), which is the canonical O5 representative; hence it is in the O5 orbit. By Lemma 8 (global sign-reversal is in the orbit), (−,+,+,+,+) is also in O5, yielding the symmetric statement. ∎
Proposition 14 (The one-point amalgamation over |A|=3 always succeeds, constructively).
Let A have size 3 and let B=A∪{b} and C=A∪{c} lie in H and agree on A. On Y:=A∪{b,c}, write p(Y)=(α,β,x,y,z) in the coordinate order (missing c, missing b, then missing the elements of A in increasing order). Then for each (α,β)∈{±1}^2 there is a choice of (x,y,z)∈{±1}^3 such that p(Y) is not in the O5 orbit, namely:
- If (α,β)=(+,+), take (x,y,z)=(+,+,+), so p(Y)=(+,+,+,+,+)=C5.
- If (α,β)=(−,−), take (x,y,z)=(−,−,−), so p(Y)=(−,−,−,−,−)=−C5.
- If (α,β)=(+,-), take (x,y,z)=(+,-,+), so p(Y)=(+,-,+,-,+)=H5.
- If (α,β)=(−,+), take (x,y,z)=(−,+,−), so p(Y)=(−,+,−,+,−)=−H5.
In all cases Y is non‑O5, hence there exists an amalgam D∈H on A∪{b,c} extending B and C.

Proof. The only new 5‑set is Y=A∪{b,c}. The displayed assignments set its 5‑vector equal to one of ±C5 or ±H5 in the fixed coordinate order, and these are not in the O5 orbit. There are no other new 5‑sets to check. Hence the extension lies in H. ∎

Proposition 15 (A solvable subclass for |A|=4 via a local H5 pattern with consistency).
Let A={1,2,3,4}, and let B=A∪{b} and C=A∪{c} lie in H and agree on A. For k∈A, write (α_k,β_k):=(p^B_k,p^C_k). Adopt the coordinate order
p(Y_k)=(p_{missing c},p_{missing b},p_{missing i},p_{missing j},p_{missing ℓ}) for Y_k={b,c}∪(A\{k}) with i<j<ℓ the increasing order on A\{k}. Suppose the type‑data satisfy the equalities
α_1=α_2=α_3=α_4,
β_1=α_3,
β_4=α_2,
β_2=β_3.
Then there exists an assignment to the six cross 4‑sets x_{ij}=f({i,j,b,c}) such that, for each k, p(Y_k) is ±C5 if α_k=β_k and ±H5 otherwise. In particular, an amalgam D∈H exists.

Proof. Define the triple of edge variables on Y_k by (x_{jℓ},x_{iℓ},x_{ij})=(α_k,β_k,α_k), where {i,j,ℓ}=A\{k} with i<j<ℓ. Each edge variable x_{ij} appears in exactly two such triples, corresponding to the two values of k∈A\{i,j}. The displayed equalities on the α_k and β_k are exactly those required to make these two prescriptions agree for every edge (a direct check using the mapping p_{missing i}=x_{jℓ}, p_{missing j}=x_{iℓ}, p_{missing ℓ}=x_{ij}). With this consistent assignment, p(Y_k)=(α_k,β_k,α_k,β_k,α_k), which is ±C5 if α_k=β_k and ±H5 otherwise. None of these are in the O5 orbit, so all four Y_k are non‑O5 and the resulting structure is an amalgam in H. ∎
Lemma 16 (Union‑bound feasibility for the |A|=4 CSP).
In the |A|=4 one‑point CSP (Proposition 3), suppose that for each k∈{1,2,3,4} the local table forbids at most one ordered triple, i.e., |{±1}^3\F(p^B_k,p^C_k)| ≤ 1. Then there exists an assignment to the six variables x_{ij} that satisfies all four constraints (so an amalgam in H exists).

Proof. There are 2^6=64 global assignments to the six variables. Fix k and a forbidden ordered triple t on its three local variables; the set of global assignments inducing t on that triangle has size 2^3 (the other three edge‑variables are free). Thus forbidding at most one triple per triangle eliminates at most 4·2^3=32 global assignments in total. Therefore at least 64−32=32 assignments remain that satisfy all four local constraints. ∎

Corollary 16.1 (A small‑table criterion for the |A|=4 step).
If the two base tables satisfy |{±1}^3\F(+,+)| ≤ 1 and |{±1}^3\F(+,-)| ≤ 1 (so, by Corollary 9, the same holds for F(−,−) and F(−,+) by triplewise negation), then for every one‑point diagram over |A|=4 there exists an amalgam D∈H.

Proof. For any instance, each Y_k uses one of the four pairs (p^B_k,p^C_k)∈{++,−−,+−,−+}; by the stated hypothesis and Corollary 9, each corresponding table forbids at most one triple. Apply Lemma 16. ∎

Lemma 17 (Global parity constraint across the four triangles).
In the |A|=4 CSP, for any assignment x_{ij}∈{±1}, the product of the triangle‑products over the four Y_k equals +1. Equivalently, an odd number of triangles cannot have triple‑product −1.

Proof. Each triangle‑product equals the product of its three edge‑variables. Multiplying the four triangle‑products together, each edge‑variable x_{ij} appears exactly twice (in the two triangles omitting i and j), hence contributes x_{ij}^2=1 to the total product. Therefore the total product is +1. ∎
Lemma 18 (ε‑cocycle for composition).
For σ,τ∈S_5 and i∈{1,2,3,4,5}, one has
ε_i(σ∘τ) = ε_i(σ) · ε_{σ^{-1}(i)}(τ).

Proof. Let A_ρ denote the signed action from Lemma 6: (A_ρ p)_i = ε_i(ρ) · p_{ρ^{-1}(i)}. Then (A_σ A_τ p)_i = ε_i(σ) · (A_τ p)_{σ^{-1}(i)} = ε_i(σ) · ε_{σ^{-1}(i)}(τ) · p_{τ^{-1}(σ^{-1}(i))}. On the other hand, A_{σ∘τ} p has i‑th coordinate ε_i(σ∘τ) · p_{(σ∘τ)^{-1}(i)}. Uniqueness of the action implies ε_i(σ∘τ) = ε_i(σ) · ε_{σ^{-1}(i)}(τ). ∎

Lemma 19 (ε for adjacent transpositions).
For s_k=(k k+1) with k∈{1,2,3,4}, the vector ε(s_k) has entries + at positions k and k+1 and − at the other three positions.

Proof. Write τ:=s_k. Using Lemma 6, ε_i(τ)=sgn(τ)·(−1)^{c_j(τ)} for j=τ^{-1}(i). A direct count shows that c_j(τ) is odd for j∉{k,k+1} and even for j∈{k,k+1}. Since sgn(τ)=−1, this yields ε_i(τ)=−1 at i∉{k,k+1} and ε_i(τ)=+1 at i∈{k,k+1}. ∎

Lemma 20 (O5‑image formula and exact pair‑set membership test).
Let e_O=(+,-,-,-,-). Define the pair‑set S:={ (ε(τ), i0=τ(1)) : τ∈S_5 }. For p∈{±1}^5, the following are equivalent:
(a) p lies in the O5 orbit (i.e., p = A_τ(e_O) for some τ∈S_5).
(b) There exists (ε,i0)∈S such that p_i=ε_i for i=i0 and p_i=−ε_i for i≠i0.
Equivalently, p is obtained from ε by flipping all coordinates except i0, with (ε,i0) realized by the same τ.

Proof. For (a)⇒(b): If p=A_τ(e_O), then for i with τ^{-1}(i)=1 one has p_i=ε_i(τ)·(+)=ε_i(τ), and for i with τ^{-1}(i)≠1 one has p_i=ε_i(τ)·(−)=−ε_i(τ). Writing i0:=τ(1) gives (b). For (b)⇒(a): Given (ε,i0)∈S, pick τ with ε(τ)=ε and τ(1)=i0. The same computation shows A_τ(e_O)=p. ∎
