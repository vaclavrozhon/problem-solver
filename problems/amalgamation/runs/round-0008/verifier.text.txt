{"feedback_md":"High-level assessment\n- There is solid, rigorous progress this round. The most valuable additions are: (i) internal S5-induced symmetries of the local tables F(α,β) (P01, Lemmas 21–23), (ii) a simple product-of-entries invariant for O5 (P02), and (iii) two concrete forbidden ordered triples with explicit τ-witnesses (P02: (++−)∉F(+,-); P03: (−, +, +)∉F(+,+)). All of these are compatible with the fixed coordinate convention already in output.md and can be cleanly integrated.\n- The exact S-oracle framework (ε-cocycle, generators, pair-set S, Lemma 20) continues to hold up; the new results leverage it correctly.\n\nCorrections and issues\n- P01’s claim “the permutation (−,+,−) never occurs under the 2+2 ansatz” is false in general. Counterexample under our fixed coordinate order: take w=(+,-,+,-) and k=4; then on A\\{4}={1,2,3} we get (x_{23},x_{13},x_{12})=(−,+,−). Thus (−,+,−) can occur for some 2+2 choices. What is true: for the specific choice w=(+,+,−,−) (or w=(−,−,+,+)), the four triangles realize only the two shapes (+,−,−) and (−,−,+). So the “two-checks suffice” reduction is valid only for that fixed w, not for arbitrary placements of the two pluses.\n- P02’s “weaker 2+2 feasibility reduction” implicitly relies on the incorrect assumption that plus-vertices always force a specific ordered shape per triangle. As noted above, the realized ordered shape depends on the indices carrying the same sign relative to i<j<ℓ, and (−,+,−) can appear. A safe conditional is: if you commit to w=(+,+,−,−), it suffices to ensure that both (+,−,−) and (−,−,+) are allowed for each pair-type that appears among the Y_k of the instance. The stronger uniform Proposition 11 remains correct as stated, requiring all three permutations of (+,−,−) per (α,β).\n- P03’s warning about misusing ε-only criteria is important. Always check the pair (ε,i0) with i0=τ(1) (Lemma 20). This prevents false positives.\n\nWhat to keep and what to discard\n- Keep and integrate: P01 Lemmas 21–23 (internal symmetries of F), P02 product-of-entries identity, P02 EX1, P03 F1. These are all fully rigorous and useful. Also keep the backtracking blueprint and parity pruning (they align with output.md Lemma 17).\n- Discard or qualify: P01’s unconditional “two-checks suffice” and P02’s “weaker 2+2 selection” as general statements. Replace with the qualified variant for the fixed choice w=(+,+,−,−).\n\nActionable next steps (precise)\n1) Implement IsO5 via the S-pair set (Lemma 20) using Lemmas 18–19; validate using the samples listed by P02 and unit tests already in notes/output. Also verify Cor. 20.1 (product-of-entries) on a random subset as a sanity check.\n2) Populate F(+,+) and F(+,-) completely. Use Lemmas 21–23 to reduce the workload: per table, test the four representatives (+++), (+,−,−), (−,−,−), (+,−,+); the rest follow by the proved internal symmetries and, for α=β, central symmetry. Derive F(−,−), F(−,+) via Cor. 9.\n3) Record and recheck the new forbidden entries: (−,+,+)∉F(+,+) (P03) and (++−)∉F(+,-) (P02). Cross-consistency: by Lemma 21, (+,−,−)∉F(+,+) follows from the first.\n4) If both |{±1}^3\\F(+,+)| and |{±1}^3\\F(+,-)| are ≤1, conclude via Cor. 16.1. Otherwise, try the fixed 2+2 assignment w=(+,+,−,−): check that (+,−,−) ∈ F(+,+) and (+,−,−) ∈ F(+,-); by Lemma 23 this also covers (−,−,+). If this passes, the fixed 2+2 construction solves all instances. If not, run the small backtracking solver with parity pruning.\n5) Archive the full F-tables and a small test suite demonstrating the internal symmetries (S3, S4, x↔z) and Lemma 21 on random entries.\n\nValue added this round\n- Structural reduction of F-table enumeration (strong, audit-ready).\n- Two independent, explicit F-table exclusions with τ-witnesses.\n- A robust debugging invariant (product-of-entries = sgn(τ)).\n- Clarified limitations of ε-only heuristics and corrected an error about realized permutations under 2+2.\n\nOverall: good partial progress; the next computational pass should decide the |A|=4 step quickly.","new_notes_md":"New internal symmetries for F(α,β), concrete exclusions, and a correction about 2+2 shapes\n\nInternal S5-induced symmetries of the local tables\n- Let F(α,β)⊆{±1}^3 be defined under the fixed coordinate convention: (x,y,z)∈F(α,β) iff (α,β,x,y,z) is non‑O5.\n- Lemma 21 (swap of the fixed coordinates; central symmetry when α=β).

Within F(α,β), (x,y,z)∈F(α,β) ⇔ (z,y,x)∈F(α,β). Proof: compose S4, then S3, then S4.\n- Consequence: The action generated by S3, S4, and (x,y,z)↦(z,y,x) preserves the triple‑product and partitions {±1}^3 into four orbits: for product +1, an orbit of size 3 {+++, +−−, −−+} and a fixed singleton {−+−}; for product −1, an orbit of size 3 {−−−, ++−, −++} and a fixed singleton {+−+}. Thus, per table, it suffices to test at most four representatives, e.g. (+++), (+−−), (−−−), (+−+). When α=β, the central symmetry of Lemma 21 reduces the representatives further.\n\nConcrete forbidden triples (with explicit τ‑witnesses)\n- In F(+,-): (++−) is forbidden. Witness: τ=(12)(34) has ε=(−,−,−,−,+) and i0=τ(1)=2. Then A_τ(e_O)=(+,−,+,+,−), i.e. (α,β,x,y,z)=(+,-,+,+,−) is O5, so (++−)∉F(+,-).\n- In F(+,+): (−,+,+) is forbidden. Witness: τ=(13) has ε=(−,−,−,−,−) (cf. Lemma 8) and i0=3. Then A_τ(e_O)=(+,+,−,+,+), so (−,+,+)∉F(+,+). By Lemma 21 (α=β), (+,−,−) is also forbidden in F(+,+).\n\nCorrection about realized permutations under the 2+2 ansatz\n- The 2+2 vertex‑sign ansatz (x_{ij}=w_i w_j with w having two + and two −) produces on each triangle a permutation of (+,−,−) (Lemma 10). However, contrary to an earlier claim, the specific permutation (−,+,−) can occur for some choices of w under our fixed coordinate order. Example: w=(+,-,+,-) and k=4 yield (x_{23},x_{13},x_{12})=(−,+,−).\n- A safe specialization: if we commit to the fixed choice w=(+,+,−,−) (or symmetrically w=(−,−,+,+)), then one checks explicitly that Y_1,Y_2 realize (−,−,+) while Y_3,Y_4 realize (+,−,−). Under this restriction, Lemma 23 guarantees that the two realized shapes are equivalent within each F(α,β), reducing checks to a single representative per base table.\n\nMinimal computation plan (refined by symmetries)\n- Implement IsO5 via Lemma 20 and validate using the sample (ε,i0) pairs and the product invariant ∏ p_i = sgn(τ).\n- Populate F(+,+), F(+,-) by testing only the four representatives (+++), (+−−), (−−−), (+−+) per table; recover the rest by Lemmas 21–23 and Cor. 9. Derive F(−,−), F(−,+) by Cor. 9.\n- If |{±1}^3\\F(+,+)|≤1 and |{±1}^3\\F(+,-)|≤1, conclude by Cor. 16.1. Otherwise, try the fixed 2+2 choice w=(+,+,−,−) and check (+,−,−)∈F(+,+) and (+,−,−)∈F(+,-); if both hold, all four Y_k are allowed by Lemma 23.

By Lemma 20, p is obtained from ε(τ) by flipping all coordinates except i0=τ(1). Thus ∏_i p_i = ε_{i0} · ∏_{i≠i0}(−ε_i) = (−1)^4 · ∏_i ε_i = ∏_i ε_i.

Let τ=(12). By Lemma 19, ε(τ)=(+,+,−,−,−). For any p=(α,β,x,y,z), the signed action gives A_τ(p)=(β,α,−x,−y,−z). Since O5-orbit membership is invariant under A_τ, p is non‑O5 iff A_τ(p) is non‑O5. This yields the stated equivalence and the corollary for α=β. ∎\n\nLemma 22 (Internal generators preserving F(α,β)).\nFor all α,β and all (x,y,z), the following equivalences hold within the same table F(α,β):\n- S3: (x,y,z)∈F(α,β) ⇔ (−y,−x,z)∈F(α,β).\n- S4: (x,y,z)∈F(α,β) ⇔ (x,−z,−y)∈F(α,β).\n\nProof. For τ=(34), Lemma 19 gives ε(τ)=(−,−,+,+,−). Hence A_τ(α,β,x,y,z)=(−α,−β,y,x,−z). Applying Lemma 8 (global sign) yields (α,β,−y,−x,z), proving S3. For τ=(45), ε(τ)=(−,−,−,+,+) and A_τ(α,β,x,y,z)=(−α,−β,−x,z,y). Applying Lemma 8 gives (α,β,x,−z,−y), proving S4. ∎\n\nLemma 23 (Swap of first and third triple coordinates within F(α,β)).\nFor all α,β and all (x,y,z), (x,y,z)∈F(α,β) if and only if (z,y,x)∈F(α,β).\n\nProof. Start from (x,y,z), apply S4 to get (x,−z,−y); then apply S3 to get (z,−x,−y); then apply S4 again to get (z,y,x). Each step preserves membership in F(α,β) by Lemma 22. ∎\n\nLemma 24 (Two explicit forbidden ordered triples in the base tables).\n(a) In F(+,-), the ordered triple (++−) is forbidden.\n(b) In F(+,+), the ordered triple (−, +, +) is forbidden.\n\nProof. (a) Take τ=(12)(34), which is even. A direct computation gives ε(τ)=(−,−,−,−,+) and i0=τ(1)=2. By Lemma 20, A_τ(e_O)=flip_all_but_one(ε,2)=(+,−,+,+,−). Hence (α,β,x,y,z)=(+,-,+,+,−) is in O5, so (++−)∉F(+,-).\n(b) Take τ=(13), for which Lemma 8 shows ε(τ)=(−,−,−,−,−). With i0=τ(1)=3, Lemma 20 yields A_τ(e_O)=(+,+,−,+,+). Thus (−,+,+)∉F(+,+). ∎","new_outputs_append":"True","verdict":"partial success"}
