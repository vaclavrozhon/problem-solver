The exact O5 membership test via the S-pair set (Lemma 20), together with the \u03b5-cocycle (Lemma 18) and \u03b5 on generators (Lemma 19), is correct and sufficient to implement IsO5.\n- Internal symmetries of the local tables F(\u03b1,\u03b2) are recorded (Lemmas 21\u201323): central symmetry for \u03b1=\u03b2 (swap of fixed coords), and two in-table transforms S3: (x,y,z)\u2194(\u2212y,\u2212x,z), S4: (x,y,z)\u2194(x,\u2212z,\u2212y), and the derived swap (x,y,z)\u2194(z,y,x). These preserve membership and triple-product within a fixed F(\u03b1,\u03b2).\n\nCritical correction \u2014 Lemma 24(b) is false\n- Claim in output.md Lemma 24(b): \u201cIn F(+,+), the ordered triple (\u2212,+,+) is forbidden.\u201d This contradicts Lemmas 21\u201323 together with a known allowed entry.\n- Rigorous contradiction:\n  1) (+++) \u2208 F(+,+) because p=(+,+,+,+,+)=C5 is non-O5 (Proposition 14; also directly obvious).\n  2) Apply S4 (Lemma 22) to (+++): we get (+,\u2212,\u2212) \u2208 F(+,+).\n  3) Apply Lemma 23 (x\u2194z): (\u2212,\u2212,+) \u2208 F(+,+).\n  4) Apply central symmetry for \u03b1=\u03b2 (Lemma 21): negate each of these three allowed triples to get (\u2212\u2212\u2212), (\u2212,+,+), (+,+,\u2212) \u2208 F(+,+).\n  Hence (\u2212,+,+) must be allowed in F(+,+), contradicting Lemma 24(b). Therefore 24(b) is incorrect and should be removed or corrected in output.md.\n\nNew rigorous consequences (derived via Lemmas 21\u201323 and known entries)\n- Lemma A (proved here). In F(+,+), all six triples in O+_A \u222a (\u2212O+_A) are allowed, where O+_A = { (+++), (+,\u2212,\u2212), (\u2212,\u2212,+) } and (\u2212O+_A) = { (\u2212\u2212\u2212), (\u2212,+,+), (+,+,\u2212) }.\n  Proof sketch. (+++) is allowed. Apply S4 to get (+,\u2212,\u2212), then Lemma 23 to get (\u2212,\u2212,+). Apply Lemma 21 (\u03b1=\u03b2) to negate these three, obtaining the other three allowed triples. Each step preserves membership. \u220e\n  Why useful: This settles two-thirds of F(+,+) without computation and, in particular, certifies the two ordered shapes (+,\u2212,\u2212) and (\u2212,\u2212,+) required by the fixed 2+2 ansatz.\n\n- Lemma B (proved here). In F(+,-), all three triples in the size-3 product \u22121 orbit O\u2212_A = { (\u2212\u2212\u2212), (++\u2212), (\u2212++) } are forbidden, while (+,\u2212,+) is allowed (Proposition 14).\n  Proof. (\u2212\u2212\u2212) is forbidden by Lemma 13. (++\u2212) is forbidden by Lemma 24(a). By S3/S4 closure (Lemma 22), the orbit generated by these two equals O\u2212_A, so (\u2212++) is also forbidden. (+,\u2212,+) was already shown allowed at |A|=3 (Proposition 14). \u220e\n  Why useful: This fully determines the product \u22121 part of F(+,-), leaving only the product +1 orbits to decide.\n\nConsequences for the |A|=4 step and the 2+2 ansatz\n- Equal-fixed case (++ and \u2212\u2212): By Lemma A and Corollary 9, the two shapes realized by the fixed 2+2 assignment w=(+,+,\u2212,\u2212) (namely (+,\u2212,\u2212) and (\u2212,\u2212,+), and their sign-negations for (\u2212\u2212)) are allowed. Thus whenever a triangle uses (\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2208{(++),(\u2212\u2212)}, the fixed 2+2 shapes are admissible.\n- Opposite-fixed cases (+\u2212 and \u2212+): By Lemma B (and Corollary 9), only the product +1 triples remain to be classified. The fixed 2+2 ansatz requires the two shapes (+,\u2212,\u2212) and (\u2212,\u2212,+); by Lemma 23, it suffices to check a single representative (+,\u2212,\u2212) in F(+,-). Corollary 9 then transfers this to F(\u2212,+).\n- Important caveat (as noted in earlier rounds and verifier feedback): Even if both shapes are allowed in each pair-type, choosing w so that each Y_k lands on an allowed shape is a small combinatorial selection problem (exactly two k realize (\u2212,\u2212,+), two realize (+,\u2212,\u2212) under any w with two pluses). If a pair-type appears three times among k and permits only one of the two shapes, the fixed 2+2 ansatz may still fail on that instance. Hence the full resolution still requires either: (i) both shapes allowed for every pair-type appearing in the instance (then we can place the two pluses appropriately), or (ii) a fall-back small backtracking over the six edge variables.\n\nShrinking the remaining computation \u2014 minimal decisive checks\n- Thanks to Lemmas A and B, only the product +1 entries of F(+,-) remain undecided. By Lemmas 21\u201323, within F(+,-) it suffices to test at most the two representatives (+++) and (+,\u2212,\u2212), plus the singleton (\u2212,+,\u2212) (since it forms its own orbit). Thus three IsO5 queries settle F(+,-) completely:\n  1) (+++) \u2208? F(+,-)\n  2) (+,\u2212,\u2212) \u2208? F(+,-)  [by Lemma 23 this also decides (\u2212,\u2212,+)]\n  3) (\u2212,+,\u2212) \u2208? F(+,-)\n- For completeness, F(+,+) still has two singleton-orbit entries whose status is not fixed by Lemma A: (+,\u2212,+) and (\u2212,+,\u2212). These are not needed for the fixed 2+2 ansatz but can be recorded by two extra queries.\n\nAuditable unit tests and examples (to validate implementation)\n- Validate Lemma 22 symmetries on random entries: IsO5(\u03b1,\u03b2,x,y,z) equals IsO5(\u03b1,\u03b2,\u2212y,\u2212x,z) and IsO5(\u03b1,\u03b2,x,\u2212z,\u2212y);\n  and Lemma 23: IsO5(\u03b1,\u03b2,x,y,z)=IsO5(\u03b1,\u03b2,z,y,x).\n- Validate central symmetry for \u03b1=\u03b2 (Lemma 21): (x,y,z)\u2208F(\u03b1,\u03b1) iff (\u2212x,\u2212y,\u2212z)\u2208F(\u03b1,\u03b1).\n- Check the forbidden set in Lemma B: (\u2212\u2212\u2212), (++\u2212), (\u2212++) are O5 for (\u03b1,\u03b2)=(+,-); (+,\u2212,+) is non-O5.\n- Reconfirm canonical sanity: (+,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212) \u2208 O5; (+,+,+,+,+) \u2209 O5; (+,\u2212,+,\u2212,+) \u2209 O5.\n\nObstacles and why a tiny computation still remains\n- An analytic classification of the product +1 part of F(+,-) still seems delicate without enumerating S (the 120 pairs). The S-oracle (Lemma 20) is the right tool and reduces the remaining unknowns to at most three checks listed above.\n- The union-bound route (Corollary 16.1) cannot close the |A|=4 step since F(+,-) already forbids at least three triples (Lemma B). The fixed 2+2 ansatz reduces the need to decide only whether (+,\u2212,\u2212) is allowed in F(+,-); if yes, the ansatz often works, but a short backtracking remains prudent for adversarial distributions of pair-types across k.\n\nActionable next steps for the verifier (precise, minimal)\n1) Remove (or mark false) output.md Lemma 24(b) and any deductions from it; retain Lemma 24(a).\n2) Implement IsO5 via Lemma 20 (S-pair set). Validate with the symmetry unit tests above and Corollary 20.1 (product-of-entries = sgn(\u03c4)).\n3) Decide the three remaining entries of F(+,-): (+++), (+,\u2212,\u2212), (\u2212,+,\u2212). Record the full table; derive F(\u2212,+) by Corollary 9.\n4) Optionally, record the two singleton-orbit entries in F(+,+): (+,\u2212,+), (\u2212,+,\u2212); though Lemma A already suffices for the fixed 2+2 shape requirements in the equal-fixed case.\n5) Attempt the fixed 2+2 ansatz w=(+,+,\u2212,\u2212) on representative |A|=4 profiles; if any instance fails (because a pair-type appears three times and permits only one of the two shapes), run the tiny backtracking solver with parity pruning (Lemma 17).\n\nGaps and corrections to note in output.md\n- Lemma 24(b) must be retracted: it contradicts Lemmas 21\u201323 and the known allowed entry (+++)\u2208F(+,+). The calculation via \u03c4=(13) cannot be used to forbid (\u2212,+,+) in F(+,+) because Lemmas 21\u201323 compel (\u2212,+,+) to be allowed once (+++) is allowed.\n- Recommend adding Lemma A and Lemma B (as stated above) explicitly: they consolidate many entries in F(+,+) and F(+,-) and sharply reduce the remaining computation.\n- When the F(+,-) product +1 entries are decided, include the final tables and restate the fixed coordinate convention adjacent to their definition for reproducibility.\n\nWhy this is incremental and auditable\n- We identified and rigorously refuted a false lemma (24(b)) in output.md, using only the already-recorded symmetries and a known allowed entry.\n- We proved two new, checkable lemmas (A and B) that substantially determine the base tables without computation and reduce the remaining unknowns in F(+,-) to at most three representative queries.\n- We outlined a minimal, deterministic plan to finish: three IsO5 checks for F(+,-), optional two for F(+,+), then either apply the fixed 2+2 assignment with a small combinatorial placement of the two pluses or fall back to a tiny backtracking consistent with Lemma 17.\n"
