The exact O5 membership test via the S-pair set (Lemma 20), together with the ε-cocycle (Lemma 18) and ε on generators (Lemma 19), is correct and sufficient to implement IsO5.\\n- Internal symmetries of the local tables F(α,β) are recorded (Lemmas 21–23): central symmetry for α=β (swap of fixed coords), and two in-table transforms S3: (x,y,z)↔(−y,−x,z), S4: (x,y,z)↔(x,−z,−y), and the derived swap (x,y,z)↔(z,y,x). These preserve membership and triple-product within a fixed F(α,β).\\n\\nCritical correction — Lemma 24(b) is false\\n- Claim in output.md Lemma 24(b): “In F(+,+), the ordered triple (−,+,+) is forbidden.” This contradicts Lemmas 21–23 together with a known allowed entry.\\n- Rigorous contradiction:\\n  1) (+++) ∈ F(+,+) because p=(+,+,+,+,+)=C5 is non-O5 (Proposition 14; also directly obvious).\\n  2) Apply S4 (Lemma 22) to (+++): we get (+,−,−) ∈ F(+,+).\\n  3) Apply Lemma 23 (x↔z): (−,−,+) ∈ F(+,+).\\n  4) Apply central symmetry for α=β (Lemma 21): negate each of these three allowed triples to get (−−−), (−,+,+), (+,+,−) ∈ F(+,+).\\n  Hence (−,+,+) must be allowed in F(+,+), contradicting Lemma 24(b). Therefore 24(b) is incorrect and should be removed or corrected in output.md.\\n\\nNew rigorous consequences (derived via Lemmas 21–23 and known entries)\\n- Lemma A (proved here). In F(+,+), all six triples in O+_A ∪ (−O+_A) are allowed, where O+_A = { (+++), (+,−,−), (−,−,+) } and (−O+_A) = { (−−−), (−,+,+), (+,+,−) }.\\n  Proof sketch. (+++) is allowed. Apply S4 to get (+,−,−), then Lemma 23 to get (−,−,+). Apply Lemma 21 (α=β) to negate these three, obtaining the other three allowed triples. Each step preserves membership. ∎\\n  Why useful: This settles two-thirds of F(+,+) without computation and, in particular, certifies the two ordered shapes (+,−,−) and (−,−,+) required by the fixed 2+2 ansatz.\\n\\n- Lemma B (proved here). In F(+,-), all three triples in the size-3 product −1 orbit O−_A = { (−−−), (++−), (−++) } are forbidden, while (+,−,+) is allowed (Proposition 14).\\n  Proof. (−−−) is forbidden by Lemma 13. (++−) is forbidden by Lemma 24(a). By S3/S4 closure (Lemma 22), the orbit generated by these two equals O−_A, so (−++) is also forbidden. (+,−,+) was already shown allowed at |A|=3 (Proposition 14). ∎\\n  Why useful: This fully determines the product −1 part of F(+,-), leaving only the product +1 orbits to decide.\\n\\nConsequences for the |A|=4 step and the 2+2 ansatz\\n- Equal-fixed case (++ and −−): By Lemma A and Corollary 9, the two shapes realized by the fixed 2+2 assignment w=(+,+,−,−) (namely (+,−,−) and (−,−,+), and their sign-negations for (−−)) are allowed. Thus whenever a triangle uses (α,β)∈{(++),(−−)}, the fixed 2+2 shapes are admissible.\\n- Opposite-fixed cases (+− and −+): By Lemma B (and Corollary 9), only the product +1 triples remain to be classified. The fixed 2+2 ansatz requires the two shapes (+,−,−) and (−,−,+); by Lemma 23, it suffices to check a single representative (+,−,−) in F(+,-). Corollary 9 then transfers this to F(−,+).\\n- Important caveat (as noted in earlier rounds and verifier feedback): Even if both shapes are allowed in each pair-type, choosing w so that each Y_k lands on an allowed shape is a small combinatorial selection problem (exactly two k realize (−,−,+), two realize (+,−,−) under any w with two pluses). If a pair-type appears three times among k and permits only one of the two shapes, the fixed 2+2 ansatz may still fail on that instance. Hence the full resolution still requires either: (i) both shapes allowed for every pair-type appearing in the instance (then we can place the two pluses appropriately), or (ii) a fall-back small backtracking over the six edge variables.\\n\\nShrinking the remaining computation — minimal decisive checks\\n- Thanks to Lemmas A and B, only the product +1 entries of F(+,-) remain undecided. By Lemmas 21–23, within F(+,-) it suffices to test at most the two representatives (+++) and (+,−,−), plus the singleton (−,+,−) (since it forms its own orbit). Thus three IsO5 queries settle F(+,-) completely:\\n  1) (+++) ∈? F(+,-)\\n  2) (+,−,−) ∈? F(+,-)  [by Lemma 23 this also decides (−,−,+)]\\n  3) (−,+,−) ∈? F(+,-)\\n- For completeness, F(+,+) still has two singleton-orbit entries whose status is not fixed by Lemma A: (+,−,+) and (−,+,−). These are not needed for the fixed 2+2 ansatz but can be recorded by two extra queries.\\n\\nAuditable unit tests and examples (to validate implementation)\\n- Validate Lemma 22 symmetries on random entries: IsO5(α,β,x,y,z) equals IsO5(α,β,−y,−x,z) and IsO5(α,β,x,−z,−y);\\n  and Lemma 23: IsO5(α,β,x,y,z)=IsO5(α,β,z,y,x).\\n- Validate central symmetry for α=β (Lemma 21): (x,y,z)∈F(α,α) iff (−x,−y,−z)∈F(α,α).\\n- Check the forbidden set in Lemma B: (−−−), (++−), (−++) are O5 for (α,β)=(+,-); (+,−,+) is non-O5.\\n- Reconfirm canonical sanity: (+,−,−,−,−) ∈ O5; (+,+,+,+,+) ∉ O5; (+,−,+,−,+) ∉ O5.\\n\\nObstacles and why a tiny computation still remains\\n- An analytic classification of the product +1 part of F(+,-) still seems delicate without enumerating S (the 120 pairs). The S-oracle (Lemma 20) is the right tool and reduces the remaining unknowns to at most three checks listed above.\\n- The union-bound route (Corollary 16.1) cannot close the |A|=4 step since F(+,-) already forbids at least three triples (Lemma B). The fixed 2+2 ansatz reduces the need to decide only whether (+,−,−) is allowed in F(+,-); if yes, the ansatz often works, but a short backtracking remains prudent for adversarial distributions of pair-types across k.\\n\\nActionable next steps for the verifier (precise, minimal)\\n1) Remove (or mark false) output.md Lemma 24(b) and any deductions from it; retain Lemma 24(a).\\n2) Implement IsO5 via Lemma 20 (S-pair set). Validate with the symmetry unit tests above and Corollary 20.1 (product-of-entries = sgn(τ)).\\n3) Decide the three remaining entries of F(+,-): (+++), (+,−,−), (−,+,−). Record the full table; derive F(−,+) by Corollary 9.\\n4) Optionally, record the two singleton-orbit entries in F(+,+): (+,−,+), (−,+,−); though Lemma A already suffices for the fixed 2+2 shape requirements in the equal-fixed case.\\n5) Attempt the fixed 2+2 ansatz w=(+,+,−,−) on representative |A|=4 profiles; if any instance fails (because a pair-type appears three times and permits only one of the two shapes), run the tiny backtracking solver with parity pruning (Lemma 17).\\n\\nGaps and corrections to note in output.md\\n- Lemma 24(b) must be retracted: it contradicts Lemmas 21–23 and the known allowed entry (+++)∈F(+,+). The calculation via τ=(13) cannot be used to forbid (−,+,+) in F(+,+) because Lemmas 21–23 compel (−,+,+) to be allowed once (+++) is allowed.\\n- Recommend adding Lemma A and Lemma B (as stated above) explicitly: they consolidate many entries in F(+,+) and F(+,-) and sharply reduce the remaining computation.\\n- When the F(+,-) product +1 entries are decided, include the final tables and restate the fixed coordinate convention adjacent to their definition for reproducibility.\\n\\nWhy this is incremental and auditable\\n- We identified and rigorously refuted a false lemma (24(b)) in output.md, using only the already-recorded symmetries and a known allowed entry.\\n- We proved two new, checkable lemmas (A and B) that substantially determine the base tables without computation and reduce the remaining unknowns in F(+,-) to at most three representative queries.\\n- We outlined a minimal, deterministic plan to finish: three IsO5 checks for F(+,-), optional two for F(+,+), then either apply the fixed 2+2 assignment with a small combinatorial placement of the two pluses or fall back to a tiny backtracking consistent with Lemma 17.\\n\"}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"auto","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"ProverOutput","schema_":{"properties":{"progress_md":{"description":"Append-only progress notes","title":"Progress Md","type":"string"}},"required":["progress_md"],"title":"ProverOutput","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":51661,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":20877,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":18432},"total_tokens":72538},"user":null,"store":true}
