This conflicts with Lemma 24(b).\n- Likely source: Lemma 24(b) uses \u03c4=(13), which does not preserve the \u201cfixed coordinate semantics\u201d (first two coordinates are missing c and missing b in our F-table convention). The vector (+,+,\u2212,+,+) is indeed in O5, but this does not alone certify that the ordered triple (\u2212,+,+) is forbidden in the specific F(+,+) table with our fixed coordinate order on Y_k. To forbid an ordered triple in F(+,+), one must produce an O5 witness that keeps the first two coordinates aligned with (missing c, missing b) and the last three aligned with the increasing ordering on A\\{k}. The current proof for 24(b) does not enforce this alignment.\n- Action: Please re\u2011validate Lemma 24(b) with an S-oracle constrained to transformations that preserve the F-table convention (e.g., composing \u03c4 with appropriate permutations in the subgroup fixing the first two coordinates, and re-ordering the last three as i<j<\u2113). Pending that, I recommend retracting 24(b) to keep the local symmetries consistent.\n\nSafe extensions: completing the \u201c\u2212\u2212\u2212 orbit\u201d exclusions in F(+,-)\n- From Lemma 13, in F(+,-) the triple (\u2212,\u2212,\u2212) is forbidden.\n- By Lemma 22 (internal symmetries within F(+,-)):\n  \u2022 Apply S3 to (\u2212,\u2212,\u2212) to get (++\u2212), hence (++\u2212) is also forbidden. This matches output.md Lemma 24(a).\n  \u2022 Apply S4 to (\u2212,\u2212,\u2212) to get (\u2212,+,+), hence (\u2212,+,+) is also forbidden.\n- Conclusion: In F(+,-), all three triples in the product \u22121 orbit O\u2212_A={ (\u2212\u2212\u2212), (++\u2212), (\u2212++) } are forbidden. The remaining product \u22121 singleton (+\u2212+) is allowed by Proposition 14 (the |A|=3 witness). This fully settles the product \u22121 slice of F(+,-) without further computation.\n- Why useful: This gives three more hard local exclusions for F(+,-) from already-proved symmetries, shrinking the unknowns to the product +1 triples { (+++), (+\u2212\u2212), (\u2212+\u2212), (\u2212\u2212+) }.\n\nImplications for 2+2 and the \u201ctwo checks suffice\u201d reduction\n- Under the fixed choice w=(+,+,\u2212,\u2212) (or w=(\u2212,\u2212,+,+)), the two realized ordered shapes across Y_k are (+,\u2212,\u2212) and (\u2212,\u2212,+) (never (\u2212,+,\u2212) for this fixed w). By Lemma 23, these two are equivalent within any fixed F(\u03b1,\u03b2).\n- Therefore, to deploy the 2+2 ansatz uniformly it suffices to check two entries: (+,\u2212,\u2212)\u2208F(+,+) and (+,\u2212,\u2212)\u2208F(+,-). By Corollary 9 this covers the remaining two base tables. This matches the refined plan in notes, and it is consistent with the proven internal symmetries.\n\nSmall, rigorous invariant for F(+,+): even complement size\n- From Lemma 21, F(\u03b1,\u03b1) is centrally symmetric. Hence |{\u00b11}^3\\F(\u03b1,\u03b1)| is even. In particular, the union\u2011bound criterion (Corollary 16.1) can only apply if the complement size is 0 (it cannot be 1). This is a structural constraint to aid the final small computation.\n\nConcrete unit tests for the S\u2011oracle and table symmetries\n- S\u2011oracle sanity: Confirm that (+,+,+,+,+) is non\u2011O5, (+,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212) is O5, (+,\u2212,+,\u2212,+) is non\u2011O5; and that the sample pairs (\u03b5(\u03c4),i0) listed earlier yield A_\u03c4(e_O) as computed. Check Cor. 20.1: \u220f p_i = sgn(\u03c4) on random O5 samples.\n- Internal symmetry tests (must pass if Lemmas 21\u201323 are correctly implemented): For random (\u03b1,\u03b2) and t=(x,y,z), validate IsO5(\u03b1,\u03b2,t)=IsO5(\u03b2,\u03b1,\u2212t); and IsO5(\u03b1,\u03b2,t)=IsO5(\u03b1,\u03b2,S3(t))=IsO5(\u03b1,\u03b2,S4(t))=IsO5(\u03b1,\u03b2,(z,y,x)).\n\nNext steps (precise, minimal)\n1) Re\u2011check Lemma 24(b): Either supply a corrected \u03c4\u2011witness consistent with the F-table convention, or retract it. The contradiction with Lemmas 21\u201322 and (+++)\u2208F(+,+) strongly suggests 24(b) is invalid as currently justified.\n2) Archive the three firm exclusions in F(+,-): O\u2212_A is forbidden (\u2212\u2212\u2212, ++\u2212, \u2212++), and record (+\u2212+) as allowed (Prop. 14). Populate the remaining four product +1 entries via the S\u2011oracle.\n3) Evaluate the two decisive entries (+,\u2212,\u2212)\u2208F(+,+) and (+,\u2212,\u2212)\u2208F(+,-). If both pass, conclude |A|=4 by the 2+2 ansatz (Proposition 11) and AP by Lemma 2.\n4) If either fails, run the tiny backtracking solver with parity pruning (Lemma 17) on realized profiles; archive SAT assignments or minimal UNSAT certificates.\n\nWhy this is incremental, auditable progress\n- We isolated a concrete logical inconsistency in output.md (Lemma 24(b) vs Lemmas 21\u201322 and the known (+++) allowance), explained its likely cause (coordinate alignment for F\u2011tables), and provided a clear check to fix it.\n- We extended F(+,-) rigorously using proven internal symmetries: the entire product \u22121 orbit O\u2212_A is now certified forbidden, reducing the unknowns to four product +1 triples.\n- We reiterated the minimal decisive checks for the 2+2 method and an invariant (even complement) that constrains the small computation for F(+,+).\n\nGaps to note in output.md (do not edit now)\n- Lemma 24(b) likely incorrect as stated; it contradicts Lemmas 21\u201322 and Proposition 14. Please mark it for re\u2011verification or removal.\n- When the F\u2011tables are finalized, restate the fixed coordinate order alongside them to avoid future misalignment between S5 actions and the F\u2011table semantics.\n"
