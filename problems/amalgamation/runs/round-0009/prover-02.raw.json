This conflicts with Lemma 24(b).\\n- Likely source: Lemma 24(b) uses τ=(13), which does not preserve the “fixed coordinate semantics” (first two coordinates are missing c and missing b in our F-table convention). The vector (+,+,−,+,+) is indeed in O5, but this does not alone certify that the ordered triple (−,+,+) is forbidden in the specific F(+,+) table with our fixed coordinate order on Y_k. To forbid an ordered triple in F(+,+), one must produce an O5 witness that keeps the first two coordinates aligned with (missing c, missing b) and the last three aligned with the increasing ordering on A\\\\{k}. The current proof for 24(b) does not enforce this alignment.\\n- Action: Please re‑validate Lemma 24(b) with an S-oracle constrained to transformations that preserve the F-table convention (e.g., composing τ with appropriate permutations in the subgroup fixing the first two coordinates, and re-ordering the last three as i<j<ℓ). Pending that, I recommend retracting 24(b) to keep the local symmetries consistent.\\n\\nSafe extensions: completing the “−−− orbit” exclusions in F(+,-)\\n- From Lemma 13, in F(+,-) the triple (−,−,−) is forbidden.\\n- By Lemma 22 (internal symmetries within F(+,-)):\\n  • Apply S3 to (−,−,−) to get (++−), hence (++−) is also forbidden. This matches output.md Lemma 24(a).\\n  • Apply S4 to (−,−,−) to get (−,+,+), hence (−,+,+) is also forbidden.\\n- Conclusion: In F(+,-), all three triples in the product −1 orbit O−_A={ (−−−), (++−), (−++) } are forbidden. The remaining product −1 singleton (+−+) is allowed by Proposition 14 (the |A|=3 witness). This fully settles the product −1 slice of F(+,-) without further computation.\\n- Why useful: This gives three more hard local exclusions for F(+,-) from already-proved symmetries, shrinking the unknowns to the product +1 triples { (+++), (+−−), (−+−), (−−+) }.\\n\\nImplications for 2+2 and the “two checks suffice” reduction\\n- Under the fixed choice w=(+,+,−,−) (or w=(−,−,+,+)), the two realized ordered shapes across Y_k are (+,−,−) and (−,−,+) (never (−,+,−) for this fixed w). By Lemma 23, these two are equivalent within any fixed F(α,β).\\n- Therefore, to deploy the 2+2 ansatz uniformly it suffices to check two entries: (+,−,−)∈F(+,+) and (+,−,−)∈F(+,-). By Corollary 9 this covers the remaining two base tables. This matches the refined plan in notes, and it is consistent with the proven internal symmetries.\\n\\nSmall, rigorous invariant for F(+,+): even complement size\\n- From Lemma 21, F(α,α) is centrally symmetric. Hence |{±1}^3\\\\F(α,α)| is even. In particular, the union‑bound criterion (Corollary 16.1) can only apply if the complement size is 0 (it cannot be 1). This is a structural constraint to aid the final small computation.\\n\\nConcrete unit tests for the S‑oracle and table symmetries\\n- S‑oracle sanity: Confirm that (+,+,+,+,+) is non‑O5, (+,−,−,−,−) is O5, (+,−,+,−,+) is non‑O5; and that the sample pairs (ε(τ),i0) listed earlier yield A_τ(e_O) as computed. Check Cor. 20.1: ∏ p_i = sgn(τ) on random O5 samples.\\n- Internal symmetry tests (must pass if Lemmas 21–23 are correctly implemented): For random (α,β) and t=(x,y,z), validate IsO5(α,β,t)=IsO5(β,α,−t); and IsO5(α,β,t)=IsO5(α,β,S3(t))=IsO5(α,β,S4(t))=IsO5(α,β,(z,y,x)).\\n\\nNext steps (precise, minimal)\\n1) Re‑check Lemma 24(b): Either supply a corrected τ‑witness consistent with the F-table convention, or retract it. The contradiction with Lemmas 21–22 and (+++)∈F(+,+) strongly suggests 24(b) is invalid as currently justified.\\n2) Archive the three firm exclusions in F(+,-): O−_A is forbidden (−−−, ++−, −++), and record (+−+) as allowed (Prop. 14). Populate the remaining four product +1 entries via the S‑oracle.\\n3) Evaluate the two decisive entries (+,−,−)∈F(+,+) and (+,−,−)∈F(+,-). If both pass, conclude |A|=4 by the 2+2 ansatz (Proposition 11) and AP by Lemma 2.\\n4) If either fails, run the tiny backtracking solver with parity pruning (Lemma 17) on realized profiles; archive SAT assignments or minimal UNSAT certificates.\\n\\nWhy this is incremental, auditable progress\\n- We isolated a concrete logical inconsistency in output.md (Lemma 24(b) vs Lemmas 21–22 and the known (+++) allowance), explained its likely cause (coordinate alignment for F‑tables), and provided a clear check to fix it.\\n- We extended F(+,-) rigorously using proven internal symmetries: the entire product −1 orbit O−_A is now certified forbidden, reducing the unknowns to four product +1 triples.\\n- We reiterated the minimal decisive checks for the 2+2 method and an invariant (even complement) that constrains the small computation for F(+,+).\\n\\nGaps to note in output.md (do not edit now)\\n- Lemma 24(b) likely incorrect as stated; it contradicts Lemmas 21–22 and Proposition 14. Please mark it for re‑verification or removal.\\n- When the F‑tables are finalized, restate the fixed coordinate order alongside them to avoid future misalignment between S5 actions and the F‑table semantics.\\n\"}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"auto","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"ProverOutput","schema_":{"properties":{"progress_md":{"description":"Append-only progress notes","title":"Progress Md","type":"string"}},"required":["progress_md"],"title":"ProverOutput","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":51661,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":18329,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":16576},"total_tokens":69990},"user":null,"store":true}
