{"progress_md":"Round 0009 — Reconciling local F-table symmetries with explicit O5 witnesses; firming up F(+,-), flagging a contradiction in output.md\n\nKey inconsistency detected in output.md (needs verifier attention)\n- Claimed facts in output.md:\n  • Lemma 21: F(α,α) is centrally symmetric: t ∈ F(α,α) ⇔ −t ∈ F(α,α).\n  • Lemma 22: Within any fixed F(α,β), membership is preserved by S3: (x,y,z)↦(−y,−x,z) and S4: (x,y,z)↦(x,−z,−y).\n  • Proposition 14: For |A|=3, (+++)∈F(+,+) (since (+,+,+,+,+)=C5 is non‑O5), hence by Lemma 21 also (−−−)∈F(+,+).\n  • Lemma 24(b): (−,+,+)∉F(+,+) (witness τ=(13)).\n- Contradiction: Apply S4 in Lemma 22 to (−−−) in F(+,+): S4(−,−,−)=(−,+,+), so (−,+,+) must be in F(+,+). This conflicts with Lemma 24(b).\n- Likely source: Lemma 24(b) uses τ=(13), which does not preserve the “fixed coordinate semantics” (first two coordinates are missing c and missing b in our F-table convention). The vector (+,+,−,+,+) is indeed in O5, but this does not alone certify that the ordered triple (−,+,+) is forbidden in the specific F(+,+) table with our fixed coordinate order on Y_k. To forbid an ordered triple in F(+,+), one must produce an O5 witness that keeps the first two coordinates aligned with (missing c, missing b) and the last three aligned with the increasing ordering on A\\{k}. The current proof for 24(b) does not enforce this alignment.\n- Action: Please re‑validate Lemma 24(b) with an S-oracle constrained to transformations that preserve the F-table convention (e.g., composing τ with appropriate permutations in the subgroup fixing the first two coordinates, and re-ordering the last three as i<j<ℓ). Pending that, I recommend retracting 24(b) to keep the local symmetries consistent.\n\nSafe extensions: completing the “−−− orbit” exclusions in F(+,-)\n- From Lemma 13, in F(+,-) the triple (−,−,−) is forbidden.\n- By Lemma 22 (internal symmetries within F(+,-)):\n  • Apply S3 to (−,−,−) to get (++−), hence (++−) is also forbidden. This matches output.md Lemma 24(a).\n  • Apply S4 to (−,−,−) to get (−,+,+), hence (−,+,+) is also forbidden.\n- Conclusion: In F(+,-), all three triples in the product −1 orbit O−_A={ (−−−), (++−), (−++) } are forbidden. The remaining product −1 singleton (+−+) is allowed by Proposition 14 (the |A|=3 witness). This fully settles the product −1 slice of F(+,-) without further computation.\n- Why useful: This gives three more hard local exclusions for F(+,-) from already-proved symmetries, shrinking the unknowns to the product +1 triples { (+++), (+−−), (−+−), (−−+) }.\n\nImplications for 2+2 and the “two checks suffice” reduction\n- Under the fixed choice w=(+,+,−,−) (or w=(−,−,+,+)), the two realized ordered shapes across Y_k are (+,−,−) and (−,−,+) (never (−,+,−) for this fixed w). By Lemma 23, these two are equivalent within any fixed F(α,β).\n- Therefore, to deploy the 2+2 ansatz uniformly it suffices to check two entries: (+,−,−)∈F(+,+) and (+,−,−)∈F(+,-). By Corollary 9 this covers the remaining two base tables. This matches the refined plan in notes, and it is consistent with the proven internal symmetries.\n\nSmall, rigorous invariant for F(+,+): even complement size\n- From Lemma 21, F(α,α) is centrally symmetric. Hence |{±1}^3\\F(α,α)| is even. In particular, the union‑bound criterion (Corollary 16.1) can only apply if the complement size is 0 (it cannot be 1). This is a structural constraint to aid the final small computation.\n\nConcrete unit tests for the S‑oracle and table symmetries\n- S‑oracle sanity: Confirm that (+,+,+,+,+) is non‑O5, (+,−,−,−,−) is O5, (+,−,+,−,+) is non‑O5; and that the sample pairs (ε(τ),i0) listed earlier yield A_τ(e_O) as computed. Check Cor. 20.1: ∏ p_i = sgn(τ) on random O5 samples.\n- Internal symmetry tests (must pass if Lemmas 21–23 are correctly implemented): For random (α,β) and t=(x,y,z), validate IsO5(α,β,t)=IsO5(β,α,−t); and IsO5(α,β,t)=IsO5(α,β,S3(t))=IsO5(α,β,S4(t))=IsO5(α,β,(z,y,x)).\n\nNext steps (precise, minimal)\n1) Re‑check Lemma 24(b): Either supply a corrected τ‑witness consistent with the F-table convention, or retract it. The contradiction with Lemmas 21–22 and (+++)∈F(+,+) strongly suggests 24(b) is invalid as currently justified.\n2) Archive the three firm exclusions in F(+,-): O−_A is forbidden (−−−, ++−, −++), and record (+−+) as allowed (Prop. 14). Populate the remaining four product +1 entries via the S‑oracle.\n3) Evaluate the two decisive entries (+,−,−)∈F(+,+) and (+,−,−)∈F(+,-). If both pass, conclude |A|=4 by the 2+2 ansatz (Proposition 11) and AP by Lemma 2.\n4) If either fails, run the tiny backtracking solver with parity pruning (Lemma 17) on realized profiles; archive SAT assignments or minimal UNSAT certificates.\n\nWhy this is incremental, auditable progress\n- We isolated a concrete logical inconsistency in output.md (Lemma 24(b) vs Lemmas 21–22 and the known (+++) allowance), explained its likely cause (coordinate alignment for F‑tables), and provided a clear check to fix it.\n- We extended F(+,-) rigorously using proven internal symmetries: the entire product −1 orbit O−_A is now certified forbidden, reducing the unknowns to four product +1 triples.\n- We reiterated the minimal decisive checks for the 2+2 method and an invariant (even complement) that constrains the small computation for F(+,+).\n\nGaps to note in output.md (do not edit now)\n- Lemma 24(b) likely incorrect as stated; it contradicts Lemmas 21–22 and Proposition 14. Please mark it for re‑verification or removal.\n- When the F‑tables are finalized, restate the fixed coordinate order alongside them to avoid future misalignment between S5 actions and the F‑table semantics.\n"}
