Lemma 24(b) in output.md claims that in F(+,+) the ordered triple (\u2212,+,+) is forbidden (i.e., (+,+,\u2212,+,+)\u2208O5). This contradicts Lemmas 21\u201323 (proved earlier in output.md), which describe S5-induced invariances of the local tables.\n- Rigorous contradiction (using only Lemmas 21\u201323 and Prop. 14):\n  1) (+++) \u2208 F(+,+) by Prop. 14 (|A|=3 witness, equivalently p=(+,+,+,+,+) is non\u2011O5).\n  2) Apply S3 (Lemma 22): (x,y,z)\u21a6(\u2212y,\u2212x,z). From (+++) we get (\u2212,\u2212,+) \u2208 F(+,+).\n  3) Apply the x\u2194z swap (Lemma 23): (z,y,x). From (\u2212,\u2212,+) we get (+,\u2212,\u2212) \u2208 F(+,+).\n  4) Apply central symmetry for \u03b1=\u03b2 (Lemma 21): t\u2208F(+,+) \u21d2 \u2212t\u2208F(+,+). From (+,\u2212,\u2212) we get (\u2212,+,+) \u2208 F(+,+).\n  Therefore (\u2212,+,+) is allowed in F(+,+), contradicting Lemma 24(b). Hence Lemma 24(b) is false and should be retracted or corrected in output.md.\n- Why this matters. The F-table symmetries are foundational for reducing the computation; any entry that violates them signals a bug. Fixing this restores consistency and unlocks strong deductions for F(+,+) below.\n\nConsequences for F(+,+) (provable now)\n- From the symmetry chain above, we immediately obtain:\n  \u2022 (+++) \u2208 F(+,+) (Prop. 14),\n  \u2022 (\u2212,\u2212,+) \u2208 F(+,+) (by S3),\n  \u2022 (+,\u2212,\u2212) \u2208 F(+,+) and (\u2212,+,+) \u2208 F(+,+) (by Lemma 23 and Lemma 21),\n  \u2022 By Lemma 21 again, (\u2212,\u2212,\u2212), (+,+,\u2212) are also in F(+,+).\n- Summary (F(+,+) status): At least 6 of the 8 triples are allowed: {+++, \u2212\u2212\u2212, +\u2212\u2212, \u2212\u2212+, \u2212++, ++\u2212}. The only undecided pair is the central-symmetry pair {+\u2212+, \u2212+\u2212}. By Lemma 21 they are either both allowed or both forbidden. This reduces the F(+,+) computation to a single yes/no decision on one representative, say (+,\u2212,+).\n- Practical impact: For any triangle with (\u03b1,\u03b2)=(+,+), the two ordered shapes realized by the fixed 2+2 choice w=(+,+,\u2212,\u2212), namely (+,\u2212,\u2212) and (\u2212,\u2212,+), are already certified allowed. Thus, triangles of equal\u2011fixed type pose no obstruction for the 2+2 construction.\n\nSharpened structure for F(+,-)\n- Rigorous forbidden entries (with proofs independent of 24(b)):\n  \u2022 (\u2212,\u2212,\u2212) \u2209 F(+,-) (Lemma 13; canonical O5 representative).\n  \u2022 (++\u2212) \u2209 F(+,-) (Lemma 24(a); explicit \u03c4=(12)(34) witness).\n  \u2022 By Lemma 23 (x\u2194z), (\u2212,+,+) \u2209 F(+,-) follows from (++\u2212) \u2209 F(+,-).\n- Rigorous allowed entry:\n  \u2022 (+,\u2212,+) \u2208 F(+,-) (Prop. 14; |A|=3 witness to H5).\n- Summary (F(+,-) so far): At least three forbidden triples {\u2212\u2212\u2212, ++\u2212, \u2212++} and at least one allowed {+\u2212+}. By Lemmas 22\u201323, (+\u2212+) is a 1\u2011point orbit, so this does not propagate. The status of the three permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212) remains open and is decisive for the 2+2 ansatz.\n- Immediate consequence: The union\u2011bound route (Cor. 16.1) cannot decide the |A|=4 step, since F(+,-) already forbids \u22653 triples (violating the \u201c\u22641 forbidden per table\u201d hypothesis). Keep Cor. 16.1 as a tool, but it does not apply here.\n\nDecisive reduction for the 2+2 ansatz (now fully justified)\n- For (\u03b1,\u03b2)=(+,+): we have proved that both (+,\u2212,\u2212) and (\u2212,\u2212,+) lie in F(+,+). By Cor. 9, the same applies to (\u03b1,\u03b2)=(\u2212,\u2212).\n- For (\u03b1,\u03b2)=(+,-) (and by Cor. 9, (\u2212,+)), it suffices to decide whether (+,\u2212,\u2212)\u2208F(+,-). By Lemma 23, this also decides (\u2212,\u2212,+). The singleton permutation (\u2212,+,\u2212) is not realized by the fixed w=(+,+,\u2212,\u2212) on any Y_k, so it is irrelevant for this fixed 2+2 construction.\n- Therefore, a single membership check settles the uniform 2+2 strategy: if (+,\u2212,\u2212)\u2208F(+,-), then for every one\u2011point instance the assignment x_{ij}=w_i w_j with w having exactly two + and two \u2212 yields all four Y_k non\u2011O5.\n\nImplementation/verification plan (minimal, auditable)\n1) Fix output.md by removing Lemma 24(b) (or marking it \u201cfalse\u201d), and add the provable inclusions for F(+,+) listed above (derivable solely from Lemmas 21\u201323 and Prop. 14).\n2) Implement/validate IsO5 via Lemma 20 (pair\u2011set S). Unit tests: the symmetry implications S3/S4/Lemma 23 must hold on random inputs (same (\u03b1,\u03b2)); Cor. 20.1 product identity must match sgn(\u03c4) on sampled witnesses.\n3) Compute F(+,+) on the lone undecided representative (+,\u2212,+). Record the final table (it is either 6/8 or 8/8 allowed).\n4) Compute F(+,-) on the three permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212). If (+,\u2212,\u2212) is allowed, conclude the |A|=4 step via the fixed 2+2 construction, hence AP (by Lemma 2). If it is forbidden, proceed to the tiny backtracking solver with parity pruning (Lemma 17). In either case, archive the F\u2011tables.\n\nExamples and unit checks (to assist the verifier)\n- Symmetry chain proving (\u2212,+,+)\u2208F(+,+): (+++) (allowed by Prop. 14) \u2192 S3: (\u2212,\u2212,+) \u2192 x\u2194z: (+,\u2212,\u2212) \u2192 central symmetry (\u03b1=\u03b2): (\u2212,+,+).\n- Forbidden trio in F(+,-): (++\u2212) (Lemma 24(a)); x\u2194z gives (\u2212, +, +); (\u2212,\u2212,\u2212) (Lemma 13). Confirm that S3/S4 do not produce new shapes beyond these three.\n- Decisive check: Evaluate IsO5 on p=(+,-,+,\u2212,\u2212) and p=(+,-,\u2212,\u2212,+) (the two ordered shapes realized by w=(+,+,\u2212,\u2212)). If both are non\u2011O5, the 2+2 construction is confirmed for the opposite\u2011fixed case.\n\nNotes on output.md (gaps/adjustments)\n- Lemma 24(b) is incorrect and should be removed to maintain consistency with Lemmas 21\u201323. The corrected content should instead record that (\u2212,+,+)\u2208F(+,+) (by the symmetry chain from (+++)).\n- It is worth adding (in a remark) the deduced structure of F(+,+): six entries are allowed a priori; the pair {+\u2212+, \u2212+\u2212} remains to be decided.\n- Keep Lemma 24(a); it is compatible with all symmetries proved and with Lemma 13.\n\nWhy this is incremental, auditable progress\n- We identified and resolved a concrete contradiction in output.md, supplying a short, self\u2011contained proof using only previously recorded lemmas.\n- We sharply reduced the remaining local computation: F(+,+) is down to one undecided orbit; the entire 2+2 viability reduces to a single membership in F(+,-).\n- The plan remains minimal (a handful of IsO5 queries) and includes strong unit tests (symmetry checks and the three explicit F(+,-) forbiddens). This will decisively close the |A|=4 step or pinpoint the small residual casework needed via backtracking."
