  "feedback_md": "Overall assessment: All three prover reports converged on a real contradiction in output.md: Lemma 24(b) claims (\u2212,+,+)\u2209F(+,+), yet this is incompatible with our already-proved internal symmetries (Lemmas 21\u201323) together with (+++)\u2208F(+,+) (Proposition 14). The contradiction is rigorous and decisive: from (+++)\u2208F(+,+), applying S4, then Lemma 23, then central symmetry (Lemma 21) shows (\u2212,+,+)\u2208F(+,+). Hence Lemma 24(b) must be removed.\n\nWhat is correct and valuable:\n- The refutation of 24(b) is sound and important; the likely source (failure to enforce the F-table coordinate convention when using the S5 witness) is correctly identified.\n- New, rigorous consequences that we can now promote to output.md:\n  \u2022 In F(+,+), the six triples {+++, +\u2212\u2212, \u2212\u2212+, and their negations} are all allowed. Only the two singleton-orbit entries {+\u2212+, \u2212+\u2212} remain undecided.\n  \u2022 In F(+,-), the entire product \u22121 orbit O\u2212={\u2212\u2212\u2212, ++\u2212, \u2212++} is forbidden. This follows from Lemma 13 (for \u2212\u2212\u2212) and Lemma 22 (S3/S4 closure). The singleton (+\u2212+) is allowed by Proposition 14.\n- Symmetry-orbit bookkeeping: Within any fixed F(\u03b1,\u03b2), the S3/S4 and x\u2194z symmetries partition {\u00b11}^3 into four orbits. For F(+,-), this reduces the remaining unknowns to just two decisions: one representative of the product +1 size-3 orbit (e.g., +++) and the singleton (\u2212+\u2212).\n\nCorrections to some suggestions:\n- \u201cTwo checks suffice for the uniform 2+2 strategy\u201d (Prover 03) is too optimistic as stated. The 2+2 ansatz produces, on each triangle, some permutation of (+,\u2212,\u2212). For triangles of type (\u2212,+), by Corollary 9 membership of t in F(\u2212,+) is equivalent to membership of \u2212t in F(+,-); thus t can be allowed in F(\u2212,+) only if \u2212t is allowed in F(+,-). Since \u2212t is product \u22121, and we have just proved the O\u2212 orbit is forbidden in F(+,-) except (+\u2212+), we must ensure that any (\u2212,+)-type triangle realizes the permutation (\u2212,+,\u2212). This is not automatic for an arbitrary 2+2 choice w; it depends on where the two pluses are placed. The \u201cfixed w=(+,+,\u2212,\u2212)\u201d specialization misses the (\u2212,+,\u2212) permutation entirely; a different 2+2 choice (e.g., w=(+,-,+,-)) can realize (\u2212,+,\u2212) on some triangles. So a small placement/backtracking over the six edge variables (or over the 2+2 choices of w) remains necessary unless we can show all three permutations of (+,\u2212,\u2212) are allowed in both opposite-fixed tables.\n\nConcrete next steps (minimal and auditable):\n1) Remove Lemma 24(b) from output.md. Keep 24(a).\n2) Add two new lemmas to output.md:\n   - F(+,+) contains the six triples {+++, +\u2212\u2212, \u2212\u2212+, \u2212\u2212\u2212, \u2212++, ++\u2212} (with proof via Lemmas 21\u201323 and Prop. 14).\n   - In F(+,-), all triples in O\u2212={\u2212\u2212\u2212, ++\u2212, \u2212++} are forbidden (with proof via Lemma 13 and Lemma 22). Record (+\u2212+) as allowed (Prop. 14).\n3) Compute the two remaining unknowns in F(+,-): one representative of the size-3 product +1 orbit (e.g., +++) and the singleton (\u2212+\u2212). By Lemma 23 and S3/S4, this settles the whole table. By Corollary 9, derive F(\u2212,+) by triplewise negation. Optionally, decide the two singleton-orbit entries in F(+,+): {+\u2212+, \u2212+\u2212} (they come as a pair by Lemma 21).\n4) Reassess the 2+2 ansatz with placement: once all four tables are known, choose a 2+2 pattern w so that each triangle\u2019s ordered permutation of (+,\u2212,\u2212) lands in an allowed entry of its F-table. If this fails for a given (B,C), run the small 2^6 backtracking with parity pruning (Lemma 17).\n5) Implementation/validation: Use the exact S-oracle (Lemma 20). Run the unit tests listed in notes (\u03b5-cocycle, product identity, symmetry invariances, and the explicit forbidden/allowed checks above).\n\nVerdict: solid partial success. We corrected a false lemma, added two nontrivial, fully rigorous lemmas materially shrinking the search, and clarified the precise minimal remaining checks and how to finish.\n",
  "new_notes_md": "Key correction: retract Lemma 24(b) and its consequences\n- Lemma 24(b) in output.md (\u201c(\u2212,+,+)\u2209F(+,+)\u201d) contradicts the already-proved symmetries. Indeed, (+++)\u2208F(+,+) by Proposition 14; applying S4 then Lemma 23 yields (+,\u2212,\u2212) and (\u2212,\u2212,+) in F(+,+); central symmetry for \u03b1=\u03b2 (Lemma 21) then yields (\u2212,+,+)\u2208F(+,+). Therefore 24(b) is false and must be removed.\n\nOrbit structure inside each local table F(\u03b1,\u03b2)\n- The operations S3: (x,y,z)\u21a6(\u2212y,\u2212x,z), S4: (x,y,z)\u21a6(x,\u2212z,\u2212y), and the swap (x,y,z)\u21a6(z,y,x) (Lemmas 22\u201323) preserve membership in a fixed F(\u03b1,\u03b2) and partition {\u00b11}^3 into four orbits:\n  \u2022 product +1: size-3 orbit {+++, +\u2212\u2212, \u2212\u2212+} and singleton {\u2212+\u2212};\n  \u2022 product \u22121: size-3 orbit {\u2212\u2212\u2212, ++\u2212, \u2212++} and singleton {+\u2212+}.\n\nNew rigorous consequences (to be used going forward)\n- F(+,+): Six entries are provably allowed\n  From (+++)\u2208F(+,+) (Proposition 14), S4 and Lemma 23 give (+,\u2212,\u2212) and (\u2212,\u2212,+), and by central symmetry for \u03b1=\u03b2 (Lemma 21) their negatives are also allowed. Hence\n  {+++, +\u2212\u2212, \u2212\u2212+, \u2212\u2212\u2212, \u2212++, ++\u2212} \u2286 F(+,+).\n  The only undecided entries in F(+,+) are the central-symmetry pair {+\u2212+, \u2212+\u2212}.\n\n- F(+,-): The product \u22121 size-3 orbit is forbidden; (+\u2212+) is allowed\n  Lemma 13 forbids (\u2212\u2212\u2212) in F(+,-). By Lemma 22, S3/S4 carry (\u2212\u2212\u2212) to (++\u2212) and (\u2212++), so these are also forbidden. Meanwhile, (+\u2212+) is allowed by Proposition 14 (|A|=3). Thus the entire product \u22121 slice of F(+,-) is decided.\n  Remaining unknowns in F(+,-): the product +1 size-3 orbit (represented by +++) and the singleton (\u2212+\u2212). Two IsO5 queries suffice to finish F(+,-). By Corollary 9, F(\u2212,+) follows by triplewise negation.\n\nCaveat and refinement for the 2+2 ansatz\n- A 2+2 assignment x_{ij}=w_i w_j produces, on each triangle, some permutation of (+,\u2212,\u2212) (Lemma 10). For triangles with pair type (\u2212,+), membership of a triple t in F(\u2212,+) is equivalent to membership of \u2212t in F(+,-) (Corollary 9). Since \u2212t has product \u22121, and we now know the product \u22121 orbit O\u2212 is forbidden in F(+,-) except for (+\u2212+), it follows that an (\u2212,+)-type triangle can only accept the permutation (\u2212,+,\u2212). Consequently:\n  \u2022 The \u201cfixed\u201d choice w=(+,+,\u2212,\u2212) (which realizes only (+,\u2212,\u2212) and (\u2212,\u2212,+)) may fail whenever (\u2212,+)-type triangles occur.\n  \u2022 A different 2+2 choice (e.g., w=(+,-,+,-)) realizes (\u2212,+,\u2212) on some triangles, so an appropriate placement of the two plus signs might satisfy all four triangles if the relevant entries are allowed in their tables. This is a small selection/backtracking problem over the 2+2 placements, not a proof that any one fixed w suffices.\n\nActionable checklist\n1) Update output.md: remove 24(b); add the two new lemmas stated above.\n2) Implement the exact S-oracle (Lemma 20). Unit tests: (+,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212)\u2208O5; (+,+,+,+,+)\u2209O5; (+,\u2212,+,\u2212,+)\u2209O5; \u03b5-cocycle (Lemma 18); product identity (Cor. 7 and Cor. 20.1); S3/S4/swap invariances (Lemmas 21\u201323).\n3) Decide F(+,-) by testing (+++) and (\u2212+\u2212); derive F(\u2212,+) by triplewise negation. Optionally decide the two singleton entries in F(+,+).\n4) With all four F-tables complete, try 2+2 placements w that assign to each triangle an allowed permutation. If any instance resists, run the tiny 2^6 backtracking with parity pruning (Lemma 17).\n\nStructural corollary to record\n- For \u03b1=\u03b2, F(\u03b1,\u03b1) is centrally symmetric (Lemma 21). Hence the size of its complement is even. This is a small but useful invariant when finishing F(+,+).\n",

  "new_outputs_md": "Proposition 1 (Orientation function model).\nFor a finite set V, giving a 4\u2011hypertournament structure (V,R) satisfying: (i) all tuples in R have distinct entries; (ii) R is closed under even permutations of coordinates; (iii) for every 4\u2011tuple of distinct vertices (x1,x2,x3,x4), exactly one of (x1,x2,x3,x4) and (x2,x1,x3,x4) lies in R; is equivalent to giving an arbitrary function f:[V]^4\u2192{\u00b11}.\nProof. Given f, declare (x1,x2,x3,x4)\u2208R iff the permutation from the increasing ordering of S={x1,x2,x3,x4} to (x1,\u2026,x4) has sign equal to f(S). This satisfies (i)\u2013(iii) by construction. Conversely, given R with (i)\u2013(iii), fix any 4\u2011set S and any increasing ordering s of S. By (iii), exactly one of s and its swap lies in R; define f(S)=+1 if s\u2208R and f(S)=\u22121 otherwise. By (ii) and (iii), membership of any ordered tuple from S depends only on the parity relative to s, so f is well defined and recovers R. \u220e\n\nLemma 2 (One\u2011point amalgamation suffices for AP in H).\nLet H be the class of finite 4\u2011hypertournaments omitting O5. Suppose that whenever A\u2208H and B=A\u222a{b}\u2208H and C=A\u222a{c}\u2208H with B\u2229C=A, there exists D\u2208H on A\u222a{b,c} extending both B and C. Then H has the amalgamation property.\nProof. Given B0,B1\u2208H over A, enumerate C\\A as c1,\u2026,ck and set A0:=A. Inductively, amalgamate Bi with Ai\u222a{ci} over Ai to obtain Bi+1 on Ai+1:=Ai\u222a{ci}. At each step, by hypothesis, all 5\u2011sets involving the new vertex ci avoid O5, and previously constructed parts are unchanged. After k steps we obtain an amalgam D\u2208H of B0 and C over A. \u220e\n\nProposition 3 (CSP formulation of the |A|=4 one\u2011point step).\nLet A={1,2,3,4}, b, c new. Given B on A\u222a{b} and C on A\u222a{c} in H that agree on A, any amalgam D on A\u222a{b,c} is determined on new 4\u2011sets by the six values x_{ij}:=f({i,j,b,c}) (1\u2264i<j\u22644). The only new 5\u2011sets are Y_k:={b,c}\u222a(A\\{k}) for k=1,2,3,4. Writing p^B_k:=f_B({b}\u222a(A\\{k})) and p^C_k:=f_C({c}\u222a(A\\{k})), the 5\u2011vector p(Y_k) has two fixed coordinates (missing c gives p^B_k; missing b gives p^C_k) and three coordinates equal to the x_{ij} for {i,j}\u2282A\\{k}. D\u2208H iff for each k, p(Y_k) is not in the O5 orbit.\nProof. All 4\u2011sets contained in B or C are already fixed. The only 4\u2011sets not contained in B or C are precisely the six X_{ij}={i,j,b,c}. The only new 5\u2011subsets of A\u222a{b,c} (relative to B and C) are those that contain both b and c; there are exactly four, the Y_k. Their p\u2011vectors depend on the listed values. Avoidance of O5 on all 5\u2011sets is thus equivalent to the stated four constraints. \u220e\n\nCorollary 4 (Trivial one\u2011point cases |A|\u22642).\nIf |A|\u22642, then one\u2011point amalgamation always succeeds in H.\nProof. When |A|\u22642 there are no 3\u2011subsets of A, hence no 5\u2011sets of the form {b,c}\u222aT with T\u2282A of size 3. Thus there are no new 5\u2011set constraints; any assignment to cross 4\u2011sets yields an amalgam in H. \u220e\n\nFact 5 (Switching yields a 4\u2011hypertournament but may change 5\u2011types).\nFor \u03b5:V\u2192{\u00b11}, define f^\u03b5(S):=(\u220f_{v\u2208S}\u03b5(v))\u00b7f(S). Then f^\u03b5 encodes a 4\u2011hypertournament. However, for a fixed 5\u2011set X, switching at v\u2208X flips the four coordinates of p(X) corresponding to 4\u2011sets containing v and leaves the coordinate \u201cmissing v\u201d unchanged; this can change the isomorphism type on X (e.g., an O5 representative (+,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212) switches at its \u2018+\u2019 vertex to (+,+,+,+,+), a C5 representative). \u220e\n\nLemma 6 (Explicit formula for the S5 action on 5\u2011vectors).\nLet X be a 5\u2011set equipped with an increasing labeling {1,2,3,4,5}.

Let \u03c4\u2032 be the induced bijection from [5]\\{j} to [5]\\{i}. By definition, \u03b5_i(\u03c4)=sgn(\u03c4\u2032). The inversions of \u03c4 split into those not involving j (in bijection with inversions of \u03c4\u2032) and those involving j, whose number is c_j(\u03c4). Hence inv(\u03c4)=inv(\u03c4\u2032)+c_j(\u03c4), so sgn(\u03c4)=sgn(\u03c4\u2032)\u00b7(\u22121)^{c_j(\u03c4)}. Rearranging gives the claimed formula. \u220e\n\nCorollary 7 (Product identity for \u03b5\u2011factors).\nFor \u03c4\u2208S5, one has \u220f_{i=1}^5 \u03b5_i(\u03c4) = sgn(\u03c4).\nProof. Using \u03b5_i(\u03c4) = sgn(\u03c4)\u00b7(\u22121)^{c_{\u03c4^{-1}(i)}(\u03c4)} and that \u03a3_j c_j(\u03c4) = 2\u00b7inv(\u03c4), we get \u220f_i \u03b5_i(\u03c4) = sgn(\u03c4)^5 \u00b7 (\u22121)^{2\u00b7inv(\u03c4)} = sgn(\u03c4). \u220e\n\nLemma 8 (Central symmetry of the O5 orbit).\nThere exists \u03c4\u2208S5 with \u03b5_i(\u03c4)=\u22121 for all i. In particular, for any 5\u2011vector p one has p\u2208O5 iff \u2212p\u2208O5.\nProof. Take \u03c4=(13) in one\u2011line notation [3,2,1,4,5]. A direct count shows c_j(\u03c4) is even for all j, while sgn(\u03c4)=\u22121, hence \u03b5_i(\u03c4)=\u22121 for every i. Since A_\u03c4 acts by signed relabeling, \u2212O5=O5. \u220e\n\nCorollary 9 (Sign\u2011flip symmetry for local tables F).\nLet F(\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2286{\u00b11}^3 be defined by: (x,y,z)\u2208F(\u03b1,\u03b2) iff (\u03b1,\u03b2,x,y,z) is non\u2011O5.

From the signed action A_\u03c1(p)_i=\u03b5_i(\u03c1)p_{\u03c1^{-1}(i)} and uniqueness of the action. \u220e\n\nLemma 19 (\u03b5 for adjacent transpositions).\nFor s_k=(k k+1), \u03b5(s_k) has + at positions k,k+1 and \u2212 elsewhere.\nProof. Directly from Lemma 6 via the c_j counts and sgn(s_k)=\u22121. \u220e\n\nLemma 20 (O5\u2011image formula and exact pair\u2011set membership test).\nLet e_O=(+,-,-,-,-) and S:={ (\u03b5(\u03c4), i0=\u03c4(1)) : \u03c4\u2208S5 }. Then for p\u2208{\u00b11}^5,\n p\u2208O5 \u21d4 \u2203(\u03b5,i0)\u2208S s.t. p_i=\u03b5_i for i=i0 and p_i=\u2212\u03b5_i for i\u2260i0.\nProof. If p=A_\u03c4(e_O), then p_i=\u03b5_i(\u03c4) for i=i0 and p_i=\u2212\u03b5_i(\u03c4) for i\u2260i0. Conversely, given (\u03b5,i0) from \u03c4, A_\u03c4(e_O) has the stated coordinates. \u220e\n\nCorollary 20.1 (Product\u2011of\u2011entries identity for O5).\nIf p=A_\u03c4(e_O), then \u220f_{i=1}^5 p_i = sgn(\u03c4).\nProof. From Lemma 20 and Corollary 7. \u220e\n\nLemma 21 (Swap of fixed coordinates; central symmetry when \u03b1=\u03b2).\nFor all \u03b1,\u03b2 and all (x,y,z),\n (x,y,z)\u2208F(\u03b1,\u03b2) \u21d4 (\u2212x,\u2212y,\u2212z)\u2208F(\u03b2,\u03b1).\nIn particular, F(\u03b1,\u03b1) is centrally symmetric.\nProof. Take \u03c4=(12) with \u03b5(\u03c4)=(+,+,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212). The action sends (\u03b1,\u03b2,x,y,z) to (\u03b2,\u03b1,\u2212x,\u2212y,\u2212z). O5\u2011avoidance is invariant under A_\u03c4. \u220e\n\nLemma 22 (Internal generators preserving F(\u03b1,\u03b2)).\nWithin a fixed table F(\u03b1,\u03b2):\n- S3: (x,y,z)\u2208F(\u03b1,\u03b2) \u21d4 (\u2212y,\u2212x,z)\u2208F(\u03b1,\u03b2).\n- S4: (x,y,z)\u2208F(\u03b1,\u03b2) \u21d4 (x,\u2212z,\u2212y)\u2208F(\u03b1,\u03b2).\nProof. For \u03c4=(34) and \u03c4=(45), combine A_\u03c4 with Lemma 8. \u220e\n\nLemma 23 (Swap of first and third triple coordinates within F(\u03b1,\u03b2)).\nWithin F(\u03b1,\u03b2), (x,y,z)\u2208F(\u03b1,\u03b2) \u21d4 (z,y,x)\u2208F(\u03b1,\u03b2).\nProof. Apply S4, then S3, then S4. \u220e\n\nCorollary 23.1 (Orbit structure on {\u00b11}^3 under S3/S4/swap within a fixed F(\u03b1,\u03b2)).\nThe set {\u00b11}^3 splits into four orbits: for product +1, a size\u20113 orbit {+++, +\u2212\u2212, \u2212\u2212+} and the singleton {\u2212+\u2212}; for product \u22121, a size\u20113 orbit {\u2212\u2212\u2212, ++\u2212, \u2212++} and the singleton {+\u2212+}. \u220e\n\nLemma 24 (An explicit forbidden triple in F(+,-)).\nIn F(+,-), the ordered triple (++\u2212) is forbidden.\nProof. Take \u03c4=(12)(34). A direct computation gives \u03b5(\u03c4)=(\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212,+) and i0=2. Then A_\u03c4(e_O)=(+,-,+,+,\u2212) shows (++\u2212)\u2209F(+,-). \u220e\n\nLemma 25 (Six allowed entries in F(+,+)).\nIn F(+,+), the six triples {+++, +\u2212\u2212, \u2212\u2212+, \u2212\u2212\u2212, \u2212++, ++\u2212} are allowed.\nProof. (+++)\u2208F(+,+) by Proposition 14. Apply S4 to get (+,\u2212,\u2212)\u2208F(+,+), then Lemma 23 to get (\u2212,\u2212,+)\u2208F(+,+). By Lemma 21 (central symmetry for \u03b1=\u03b2), the negatives are also in F(+,+). \u220e\n\nCorollary 25.1 (At most two undecided entries in F(+,+)).\nThe only entries not decided by Lemma 25 are the singleton\u2011orbit pair {+\u2212+, \u2212+\u2212}, which are either both allowed or both forbidden (by Lemma 21). \u220e\n\nLemma 26 (The product \u22121 size\u20113 orbit is forbidden in F(+,-)).\nIn F(+,-), each of (\u2212\u2212\u2212), (++\u2212), (\u2212++) is forbidden. Moreover, (+\u2212+) is allowed (Proposition 14).\nProof. Lemma 13 forbids (\u2212\u2212\u2212). By Lemma 22, S3 sends (\u2212\u2212\u2212) to (++\u2212), and S4 sends it to (\u2212++), so these are also forbidden. The allowance of (+\u2212+) follows from Proposition 14. \u220e\n",
