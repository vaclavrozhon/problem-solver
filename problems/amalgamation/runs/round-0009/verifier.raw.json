The contradiction is rigorous and decisive: from (+++)∈F(+,+), applying S4, then Lemma 23, then central symmetry (Lemma 21) shows (−,+,+)∈F(+,+). Hence Lemma 24(b) must be removed.\\n\\nWhat is correct and valuable:\\n- The refutation of 24(b) is sound and important; the likely source (failure to enforce the F-table coordinate convention when using the S5 witness) is correctly identified.\\n- New, rigorous consequences that we can now promote to output.md:\\n  • In F(+,+), the six triples {+++, +−−, −−+, and their negations} are all allowed. Only the two singleton-orbit entries {+−+, −+−} remain undecided.\\n  • In F(+,-), the entire product −1 orbit O−={−−−, ++−, −++} is forbidden. This follows from Lemma 13 (for −−−) and Lemma 22 (S3/S4 closure). The singleton (+−+) is allowed by Proposition 14.\\n- Symmetry-orbit bookkeeping: Within any fixed F(α,β), the S3/S4 and x↔z symmetries partition {±1}^3 into four orbits. For F(+,-), this reduces the remaining unknowns to just two decisions: one representative of the product +1 size-3 orbit (e.g., +++) and the singleton (−+−).\\n\\nCorrections to some suggestions:\\n- “Two checks suffice for the uniform 2+2 strategy” (Prover 03) is too optimistic as stated. The 2+2 ansatz produces, on each triangle, some permutation of (+,−,−). For triangles of type (−,+), by Corollary 9 membership of t in F(−,+) is equivalent to membership of −t in F(+,-); thus t can be allowed in F(−,+) only if −t is allowed in F(+,-). Since −t is product −1, and we have just proved the O− orbit is forbidden in F(+,-) except (+−+), we must ensure that any (−,+)-type triangle realizes the permutation (−,+,−). This is not automatic for an arbitrary 2+2 choice w; it depends on where the two pluses are placed. The “fixed w=(+,+,−,−)” specialization misses the (−,+,−) permutation entirely; a different 2+2 choice (e.g., w=(+,-,+,-)) can realize (−,+,−) on some triangles. So a small placement/backtracking over the six edge variables (or over the 2+2 choices of w) remains necessary unless we can show all three permutations of (+,−,−) are allowed in both opposite-fixed tables.\\n\\nConcrete next steps (minimal and auditable):\\n1) Remove Lemma 24(b) from output.md. Keep 24(a).\\n2) Add two new lemmas to output.md:\\n   - F(+,+) contains the six triples {+++, +−−, −−+, −−−, −++, ++−} (with proof via Lemmas 21–23 and Prop. 14).\\n   - In F(+,-), all triples in O−={−−−, ++−, −++} are forbidden (with proof via Lemma 13 and Lemma 22). Record (+−+) as allowed (Prop. 14).\\n3) Compute the two remaining unknowns in F(+,-): one representative of the size-3 product +1 orbit (e.g., +++) and the singleton (−+−). By Lemma 23 and S3/S4, this settles the whole table. By Corollary 9, derive F(−,+) by triplewise negation. Optionally, decide the two singleton-orbit entries in F(+,+): {+−+, −+−} (they come as a pair by Lemma 21).\\n4) Reassess the 2+2 ansatz with placement: once all four tables are known, choose a 2+2 pattern w so that each triangle’s ordered permutation of (+,−,−) lands in an allowed entry of its F-table. If this fails for a given (B,C), run the small 2^6 backtracking with parity pruning (Lemma 17).\\n5) Implementation/validation: Use the exact S-oracle (Lemma 20). Run the unit tests listed in notes (ε-cocycle, product identity, symmetry invariances, and the explicit forbidden/allowed checks above).\\n\\nVerdict: solid partial success. We corrected a false lemma, added two nontrivial, fully rigorous lemmas materially shrinking the search, and clarified the precise minimal remaining checks and how to finish.\\n\",\"new_notes_md\":\"Key correction: retract Lemma 24(b) and its consequences\\n- Lemma 24(b) in output.md (“(−,+,+)∉F(+,+)”) contradicts the already-proved symmetries. Indeed, (+++)∈F(+,+) by Proposition 14; applying S4 then Lemma 23 yields (+,−,−) and (−,−,+) in F(+,+); central symmetry for α=β (Lemma 21) then yields (−,+,+)∈F(+,+). Therefore 24(b) is false and must be removed.\\n\\nOrbit structure inside each local table F(α,β)\\n- The operations S3: (x,y,z)↦(−y,−x,z), S4: (x,y,z)↦(x,−z,−y), and the swap (x,y,z)↦(z,y,x) (Lemmas 22–23) preserve membership in a fixed F(α,β) and partition {±1}^3 into four orbits:\\n  • product +1: size-3 orbit {+++, +−−, −−+} and singleton {−+−};\\n  • product −1: size-3 orbit {−−−, ++−, −++} and singleton {+−+}.\\n\\nNew rigorous consequences (to be used going forward)\\n- F(+,+): Six entries are provably allowed\\n  From (+++)∈F(+,+) (Proposition 14), S4 and Lemma 23 give (+,−,−) and (−,−,+), and by central symmetry for α=β (Lemma 21) their negatives are also allowed. Hence\\n  {+++, +−−, −−+, −−−, −++, ++−} ⊆ F(+,+).\\n  The only undecided entries in F(+,+) are the central-symmetry pair {+−+, −+−}.\\n\\n- F(+,-): The product −1 size-3 orbit is forbidden; (+−+) is allowed\\n  Lemma 13 forbids (−−−) in F(+,-). By Lemma 22, S3/S4 carry (−−−) to (++−) and (−++), so these are also forbidden. Meanwhile, (+−+) is allowed by Proposition 14 (|A|=3). Thus the entire product −1 slice of F(+,-) is decided.\\n  Remaining unknowns in F(+,-): the product +1 size-3 orbit (represented by +++) and the singleton (−+−). Two IsO5 queries suffice to finish F(+,-). By Corollary 9, F(−,+) follows by triplewise negation.\\n\\nCaveat and refinement for the 2+2 ansatz\\n- A 2+2 assignment x_{ij}=w_i w_j produces, on each triangle, some permutation of (+,−,−) (Lemma 10). For triangles with pair type (−,+), membership of a triple t in F(−,+) is equivalent to membership of −t in F(+,-) (Corollary 9). Since −t has product −1, and we now know the product −1 orbit O− is forbidden in F(+,-) except for (+−+), it follows that an (−,+)-type triangle can only accept the permutation (−,+,−). Consequently:\\n  • The “fixed” choice w=(+,+,−,−) (which realizes only (+,−,−) and (−,−,+)) may fail whenever (−,+)-type triangles occur.\\n  • A different 2+2 choice (e.g., w=(+,-,+,-)) realizes (−,+,−) on some triangles, so an appropriate placement of the two plus signs might satisfy all four triangles if the relevant entries are allowed in their tables. This is a small selection/backtracking problem over the 2+2 placements, not a proof that any one fixed w suffices.\\n\\nActionable checklist\\n1) Update output.md: remove 24(b); add the two new lemmas stated above.\\n2) Implement the exact S-oracle (Lemma 20). Unit tests: (+,−,−,−,−)∈O5; (+,+,+,+,+)∉O5; (+,−,+,−,+)∉O5; ε-cocycle (Lemma 18); product identity (Cor. 7 and Cor. 20.1); S3/S4/swap invariances (Lemmas 21–23).\\n3) Decide F(+,-) by testing (+++) and (−+−); derive F(−,+) by triplewise negation. Optionally decide the two singleton entries in F(+,+).\\n4) With all four F-tables complete, try 2+2 placements w that assign to each triangle an allowed permutation. If any instance resists, run the tiny 2^6 backtracking with parity pruning (Lemma 17).\\n\\nStructural corollary to record\\n- For α=β, F(α,α) is centrally symmetric (Lemma 21). Hence the size of its complement is even. This is a small but useful invariant when finishing F(+,+).\\n\",\"new_notes_append\":\"True\",\"new_outputs_md\":\"Proposition 1 (Orientation function model).\\nFor a finite set V, giving a 4‑hypertournament structure (V,R) satisfying: (i) all tuples in R have distinct entries; (ii) R is closed under even permutations of coordinates; (iii) for every 4‑tuple of distinct vertices (x1,x2,x3,x4), exactly one of (x1,x2,x3,x4) and (x2,x1,x3,x4) lies in R; is equivalent to giving an arbitrary function f:[V]^4→{±1}.\\nProof. Given f, declare (x1,x2,x3,x4)∈R iff the permutation from the increasing ordering of S={x1,x2,x3,x4} to (x1,…,x4) has sign equal to f(S). This satisfies (i)–(iii) by construction. Conversely, given R with (i)–(iii), fix any 4‑set S and any increasing ordering s of S. By (iii), exactly one of s and its swap lies in R; define f(S)=+1 if s∈R and f(S)=−1 otherwise. By (ii) and (iii), membership of any ordered tuple from S depends only on the parity relative to s, so f is well defined and recovers R. ∎\\n\\nLemma 2 (One‑point amalgamation suffices for AP in H).\\nLet H be the class of finite 4‑hypertournaments omitting O5. Suppose that whenever A∈H and B=A∪{b}∈H and C=A∪{c}∈H with B∩C=A, there exists D∈H on A∪{b,c} extending both B and C. Then H has the amalgamation property.\\nProof. Given B0,B1∈H over A, enumerate C\\\\A as c1,…,ck and set A0:=A. Inductively, amalgamate Bi with Ai∪{ci} over Ai to obtain Bi+1 on Ai+1:=Ai∪{ci}. At each step, by hypothesis, all 5‑sets involving the new vertex ci avoid O5, and previously constructed parts are unchanged. After k steps we obtain an amalgam D∈H of B0 and C over A. ∎\\n\\nProposition 3 (CSP formulation of the |A|=4 one‑point step).\\nLet A={1,2,3,4}, b, c new. Given B on A∪{b} and C on A∪{c} in H that agree on A, any amalgam D on A∪{b,c} is determined on new 4‑sets by the six values x_{ij}:=f({i,j,b,c}) (1≤i<j≤4). The only new 5‑sets are Y_k:={b,c}∪(A\\\\{k}) for k=1,2,3,4. Writing p^B_k:=f_B({b}∪(A\\\\{k})) and p^C_k:=f_C({c}∪(A\\\\{k})), the 5‑vector p(Y_k) has two fixed coordinates (missing c gives p^B_k; missing b gives p^C_k) and three coordinates equal to the x_{ij} for {i,j}⊂A\\\\{k}. D∈H iff for each k, p(Y_k) is not in the O5 orbit.\\nProof. All 4‑sets contained in B or C are already fixed. The only 4‑sets not contained in B or C are precisely the six X_{ij}={i,j,b,c}. The only new 5‑subsets of A∪{b,c} (relative to B and C) are those that contain both b and c; there are exactly four, the Y_k. Their p‑vectors depend on the listed values. Avoidance of O5 on all 5‑sets is thus equivalent to the stated four constraints. ∎\\n\\nCorollary 4 (Trivial one‑point cases |A|≤2).\\nIf |A|≤2, then one‑point amalgamation always succeeds in H.\\nProof. When |A|≤2 there are no 3‑subsets of A, hence no 5‑sets of the form {b,c}∪T with T⊂A of size 3. Thus there are no new 5‑set constraints; any assignment to cross 4‑sets yields an amalgam in H. ∎\\n\\nFact 5 (Switching yields a 4‑hypertournament but may change 5‑types).\\nFor ε:V→{±1}, define f^ε(S):=(∏_{v∈S}ε(v))·f(S). Then f^ε encodes a 4‑hypertournament. However, for a fixed 5‑set X, switching at v∈X flips the four coordinates of p(X) corresponding to 4‑sets containing v and leaves the coordinate “missing v” unchanged; this can change the isomorphism type on X (e.g., an O5 representative (+,−,−,−,−) switches at its ‘+’ vertex to (+,+,+,+,+), a C5 representative). ∎\\n\\nLemma 6 (Explicit formula for the S5 action on 5‑vectors).\\nLet X be a 5‑set equipped with an increasing labeling {1,2,3,4,5}. For τ∈S5 and i∈{1,…,5}, write j:=τ^{-1}(i) and define\\nc_j(τ) := |{k<j : τ(k) > τ(j)}| + |{k>j : τ(k) < τ(j)}|.\\nIn the isomorphism action on p∈{±1}^X given by p′_i = ε_i(τ)·p_{τ^{-1}(i)}, the sign factor is\\nε_i(τ) = sgn(τ)·(−1)^{c_j(τ)}.\\nProof. Let τ′ be the induced bijection from [5]\\\\{j} to [5]\\\\{i}. By definition, ε_i(τ)=sgn(τ′). The inversions of τ split into those not involving j (in bijection with inversions of τ′) and those involving j, whose number is c_j(τ). Hence inv(τ)=inv(τ′)+c_j(τ), so sgn(τ)=sgn(τ′)·(−1)^{c_j(τ)}. Rearranging gives the claimed formula. ∎\\n\\nCorollary 7 (Product identity for ε‑factors).\\nFor τ∈S5, one has ∏_{i=1}^5 ε_i(τ) = sgn(τ).\\nProof. Using ε_i(τ) = sgn(τ)·(−1)^{c_{τ^{-1}(i)}(τ)} and that Σ_j c_j(τ) = 2·inv(τ), we get ∏_i ε_i(τ) = sgn(τ)^5 · (−1)^{2·inv(τ)} = sgn(τ). ∎\\n\\nLemma 8 (Central symmetry of the O5 orbit).\\nThere exists τ∈S5 with ε_i(τ)=−1 for all i. In particular, for any 5‑vector p one has p∈O5 iff −p∈O5.\\nProof. Take τ=(13) in one‑line notation [3,2,1,4,5]. A direct count shows c_j(τ) is even for all j, while sgn(τ)=−1, hence ε_i(τ)=−1 for every i. Since A_τ acts by signed relabeling, −O5=O5. ∎\\n\\nCorollary 9 (Sign‑flip symmetry for local tables F).\\nLet F(α,β)⊆{±1}^3 be defined by: (x,y,z)∈F(α,β) iff (α,β,x,y,z) is non‑O5. Then\\nF(−α,−β) = { (−x,−y,−z) : (x,y,z)∈F(α,β) }.\\nProof. (α,β,x,y,z) is non‑O5 iff (−α,−β,−x,−y,−z) is non‑O5 by Lemma 8. ∎\\n\\nLemma 10 (2+2 vertex signs induce (+−−)‑type on every triangle).\\nLet A={1,2,3,4} and choose w_i∈{±1} with exactly two plus and two minus. Define x_{ij}:=w_i w_j for 1≤i<j≤4. For each k∈A, on the triangle A\\\\{k} the ordered triple of edge‑variables (in the fixed coordinate convention) is a permutation of (+,−,−).\\nProof. If k is a + vertex, A\\\\{k} contains one + and two −, giving products (−,−,+). If k is a − vertex, the products are (+,−,−). ∎\\n\\nProposition 11 (Conditional |A|=4 amalgamation via a uniform 2+2 ansatz).\\nFix a consistent ordering convention for F(α,β). Suppose that for each (α,β)∈{++, +−, −+, −−}, all three permutations of (+,−,−) lie in F(α,β). Then for every one‑point diagram over |A|=4 there exists an amalgam D∈H obtained by setting x_{ij}=w_i w_j for some choice of w with exactly two + and two − on A.\\nProof. By Lemma 10, each triangle contributes a permutation of (+,−,−), which by hypothesis is allowed in its table. ∎\\n\\nProposition 12 (Equal‑constant fixed pairs are solvable by a constant assignment).\\nIn the |A|=4 one‑point problem, if (p^B_k,p^C_k)=(δ,δ) for all k with δ∈{±1}, then setting x_{ij}≡δ yields p(Y_k)=(δ,δ,δ,δ,δ)=±C5, hence D∈H.\\nProof. Immediate. ∎\\n\\nLemma 13 (A hard local exclusion in the opposite‑fixed case).\\nIn F(+,-), (−,−,−) is forbidden; by Corollary 9, (+++) is forbidden in F(−,+).\\nProof. p=(+,-,−,−,−) is the canonical O5 representative. Negating gives the symmetric statement. ∎\\n\\nProposition 14 (The one‑point amalgamation over |A|=3 always succeeds, constructively).\\nLet A have size 3. Writing p(Y)=(α,β,x,y,z) in the fixed order, the following choices avoid O5:\\n- (α,β)=(+,+): (x,y,z)=(+,+,+) → p(Y)=C5.\\n- (α,β)=(−,−): (x,y,z)=(−,−,−) → p(Y)=−C5.\\n- (α,β)=(+,-): (x,y,z)=(+,-,+) → p(Y)=H5.\\n- (α,β)=(−,+): (x,y,z)=(−,+,−) → p(Y)=−H5.\\nThus the |A|=3 one‑point step always succeeds. ∎\\n\\nProposition 15 (A solvable subclass for |A|=4 via a local H5 pattern with consistency).\\nWith notation as in Proposition 3, suppose the type‑data satisfy α_1=α_2=α_3=α_4, β_1=α_3, β_4=α_2, β_2=β_3. Then there exists an assignment making each p(Y_k)=±C5 if α_k=β_k and ±H5 otherwise, hence an amalgam exists.\\nProof. Define (x_{jℓ},x_{iℓ},x_{ij})=(α_k,β_k,α_k) for Y_k={b,c}∪{i,j,ℓ} with i<j<ℓ. The displayed equalities are exactly those needed for edge‑consistency. ∎\\n\\nLemma 16 (Union‑bound feasibility for the |A|=4 CSP).\\nIf each Y_k forbids at most one ordered triple in its F‑table, then some assignment to the six x_{ij} satisfies all constraints.\\nProof. Each forbidden triple rules out exactly 2^3 global assignments. With ≤1 forbidden per triangle, ≤4·2^3=32 assignments are ruled out among 2^6=64. ∎\\n\\nCorollary 16.1 (A small‑table criterion for the |A|=4 step).\\nIf |{±1}^3\\\\F(+,+)| ≤ 1 and |{±1}^3\\\\F(+,-)| ≤ 1, then every |A|=4 one‑point diagram has an amalgam (by Corollary 9 also covering F(−,−),F(−,+)). ∎\\n\\nLemma 17 (Global parity constraint across the four triangles).\\nIn the |A|=4 CSP, the product of the triangle‑products over the four Y_k equals +1. In particular, an odd number of triangles cannot have triple‑product −1.\\nProof. Each x_{ij} appears in exactly two triangles, contributing x_{ij}^2=1 to the total product. ∎\\n\\nLemma 18 (ε‑cocycle for composition).\\nFor σ,τ∈S5 and i∈{1,…,5}, ε_i(σ∘τ) = ε_i(σ)·ε_{σ^{-1}(i)}(τ).\\nProof. From the signed action A_ρ(p)_i=ε_i(ρ)p_{ρ^{-1}(i)} and uniqueness of the action. ∎\\n\\nLemma 19 (ε for adjacent transpositions).\\nFor s_k=(k k+1), ε(s_k) has + at positions k,k+1 and − elsewhere.\\nProof. Directly from Lemma 6 via the c_j counts and sgn(s_k)=−1. ∎\\n\\nLemma 20 (O5‑image formula and exact pair‑set membership test).\\nLet e_O=(+,-,-,-,-) and S:={ (ε(τ), i0=τ(1)) : τ∈S5 }. Then for p∈{±1}^5,\\n p∈O5 ⇔ ∃(ε,i0)∈S s.t. p_i=ε_i for i=i0 and p_i=−ε_i for i≠i0.\\nProof. If p=A_τ(e_O), then p_i=ε_i(τ) for i=i0 and p_i=−ε_i(τ) for i≠i0. Conversely, given (ε,i0) from τ, A_τ(e_O) has the stated coordinates. ∎\\n\\nCorollary 20.1 (Product‑of‑entries identity for O5).\\nIf p=A_τ(e_O), then ∏_{i=1}^5 p_i = sgn(τ).\\nProof.

Take τ=(12) with ε(τ)=(+,+,−,−,−). The action sends (α,β,x,y,z) to (β,α,−x,−y,−z). O5‑avoidance is invariant under A_τ. ∎\\n\\nLemma 22 (Internal generators preserving F(α,β)).\\nWithin a fixed table F(α,β):\\n- S3: (x,y,z)∈F(α,β) ⇔ (−y,−x,z)∈F(α,β).\\n- S4: (x,y,z)∈F(α,β) ⇔ (x,−z,−y)∈F(α,β).\\nProof. For τ=(34) and τ=(45), combine A_τ with Lemma 8. ∎\\n\\nLemma 23 (Swap of first and third triple coordinates within F(α,β)).\\nWithin F(α,β), (x,y,z)∈F(α,β) ⇔ (z,y,x)∈F(α,β).\\nProof.

(+++)∈F(+,+) by Proposition 14. Apply S4 to get (+,−,−)∈F(+,+), then Lemma 23 to get (−,−,+)∈F(+,+). By Lemma 21 (central symmetry for α=β), the negatives are also in F(+,+). ∎\\n\\nCorollary 25.1 (At most two undecided entries in F(+,+)).\\nThe only entries not decided by Lemma 25 are the singleton‑orbit pair {+−+, −+−}, which are either both allowed or both forbidden (by Lemma 21). ∎\\n\\nLemma 26 (The product −1 size‑3 orbit is forbidden in F(+,-)).\\nIn F(+,-), each of (−−−), (++−), (−++) is forbidden. Moreover, (+−+) is allowed (Proposition 14).\\nProof. Lemma 13 forbids (−−−). By Lemma 22, S3 sends (−−−) to (++−), and S4 sends it to (−++), so these are also forbidden.
