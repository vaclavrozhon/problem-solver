Overall assessment: All three prover reports converged on a real contradiction in output.md: Lemma 24(b) claims (−,+,+)∉F(+,+), yet this is incompatible with our already-proved internal symmetries (Lemmas 21–23) together with (+++)∈F(+,+) (Proposition 14). The contradiction is rigorous and decisive: from (+++)∈F(+,+), applying S4, then Lemma 23, then central symmetry (Lemma 21) shows (−,+,+)∈F(+,+). Hence Lemma 24(b) must be removed.
