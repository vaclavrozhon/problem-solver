Both provers independently reduce the AP question for H (finite 4-hypertournaments forbidding O_5) to a small, finite, auditable constraint problem: encode a 4-hypertournament by an alternating ±1 function f on 4-sets, observe that forbidding O_5 is a local 5-set constraint, and note that AP reduces to checking one-point amalgamation. The minimal nontrivial case is |A|=4: the problem becomes a 6-variable Boolean CSP (variables x_{ij} for pairs in A) with four local 5-set constraints (each must avoid the O_5 orbit). Prover-01 emphasizes the switching operation (multiply f by ε-products) which preserves the O_5/non-O_5 partition and gives normalization power; Prover-02 gives a clean orientation-function formalism and isolates the precise 6-variable CSP and a necessary-triangle condition in a symmetric case. Both provide explicit canonical templates for C5,H5,O5, and an explicit, small computational plan to decide the |A|=3 and |A|=4 cases by enumerating S5-orbits and brute-force searching the CSP. Verifier remains "uncertain" pending these computations. (Sources: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json.)
