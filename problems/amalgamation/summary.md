Both provers independently reduce the AP question for H (finite 4-hypertournaments forbidding O_5) to a small, finite, auditable constraint problem: encode a 4-hypertournament by an alternating ±1 function f on 4-sets, observe that forbidding O_5 is a local 5-set constraint, and note that AP reduces to checking one-point amalgamation. The minimal nontrivial case is |A|=4: the problem becomes a 6-variable Boolean CSP (variables x_{ij} for pairs in A) with four local 5-set constraints (each must avoid the O_5 orbit). Prover-01 emphasizes the switching operation (multiply f by ε-products) which preserves the O_5/non-O_5 partition and gives normalization power; Prover-02 gives a clean orientation-function formalism and isolates the precise 6-variable CSP and a necessary-triangle condition in a symmetric case. Both provide explicit canonical templates for C5,H5,O5, and an explicit, small computational plan to decide the |A|=3 and |A|=4 cases by enumerating S5-orbits and brute-force searching the CSP. Verifier remains "uncertain" pending these computations. (Sources: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json.)

This round validated the core reductions from output.md while correcting a mistaken “switching” normalization and identified two remaining gaps: the |A|=3 α≠β subcase and the concrete F(α,β) tables needed to finish the |A|=4 CSP. A concrete, implementable formula for the S5 signed action was derived (ε_i(τ)=sgn(τ)·(−1)^{c_{τ^{-1}(i)}(τ)} with c_j the inversion count), together with the product identity ∏ε_i=sgn(τ). The recommended computational route is to build IsO5 by orbit enumeration of p_O, compute the two small constraint tables F_eq=F(+,+) and F_opp=F(+,−) (each ≤8 triples), finish |A|=3 by lookup, then brute-force the 6-variable |A|=4 CSP (64 assignments) on representative B,C profiles. Two lemmas were proved: (A) |A|=3 with α=β solved by the all-equal triple, and (B) |A|=4 aligned B,C solved by constant cross-edges. A promising uniform ansatz x_{ij}=w_i w_j (w_i=p^B_i p^C_i) was proposed to try across cases. Concrete next steps and tests were listed for the verifier.
