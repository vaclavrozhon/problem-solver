Both provers independently reduce the AP question for H (finite 4-hypertournaments forbidding O_5) to a small, finite, auditable constraint problem: encode a 4-hypertournament by an alternating ±1 function f on 4-sets, observe that forbidding O_5 is a local 5-set constraint, and note that AP reduces to checking one-point amalgamation. The minimal nontrivial case is |A|=4: the problem becomes a 6-variable Boolean CSP (variables x_{ij} for pairs in A) with four local 5-set constraints (each must avoid the O_5 orbit). Prover-01 emphasizes the switching operation (multiply f by ε-products) which preserves the O_5/non-O_5 partition and gives normalization power; Prover-02 gives a clean orientation-function formalism and isolates the precise 6-variable CSP and a necessary-triangle condition in a symmetric case. Both provide explicit canonical templates for C5,H5,O5, and an explicit, small computational plan to decide the |A|=3 and |A|=4 cases by enumerating S5-orbits and brute-force searching the CSP. Verifier remains "uncertain" pending these computations. (Sources: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json.)

## round-0002 — model summary — 2025-08-27T14:56:56.512498Z
This round validated the core reductions from output.md while correcting a mistaken “switching” normalization and identified two remaining gaps: the |A|=3 α≠β subcase and the concrete F(α,β) tables needed to finish the |A|=4 CSP. A concrete, implementable formula for the S5 signed action was derived (ε_i(τ)=sgn(τ)·(−1)^{c_{τ^{-1}(i)}(τ)} with c_j the inversion count), together with the product identity ∏ε_i=sgn(τ). The recommended computational route is to build IsO5 by orbit enumeration of p_O, compute the two small constraint tables F_eq=F(+,+) and F_opp=F(+,−) (each ≤8 triples), finish |A|=3 by lookup, then brute-force the 6-variable |A|=4 CSP (64 assignments) on representative B,C profiles. Two lemmas were proved: (A) |A|=3 with α=β solved by the all-equal triple, and (B) |A|=4 aligned B,C solved by constant cross-edges. A promising uniform ansatz x_{ij}=w_i w_j (w_i=p^B_i p^C_i) was proposed to try across cases. Concrete next steps and tests were listed for the verifier.

## round-0003 — model summary — 2025-08-27T15:07:19.949557Z
This round produced a concrete, checkable plan to finish the remaining small-case verifications for AP. outputs.md already records the orientation-function model, one-point sufficiency lemmas, the |A|=4 CSP formulation, trivial |A|≤2 cases, and the S5-action identity; missing are (i) an explicit O5-orbit classification for the “two-fixed + three-free” 5-vectors, (ii) the four local tables F(α,β)⊆{±1}^3, (iii) a |A|=3 one-point proof (with witnesses), and (iv) a resolution of the |A|=4 6-variable CSP. New micro-lemmas: p^B_k/p^C_k are exactly the fixed “positive” bits coming from 5-point types (justifying S4-reduction); Claim N1 rules out (−,−,−) for (α,+;β,−) and symmetrically (+,+,+) for (α,−;β,+) (easy IsO5 unit tests); a triangle/edge ansatz x_{ij}=w_iw_j realizes all product +1 triangle patterns and reduces the global search to 2^4 choices (fallback brute force is 2^6=64). A concrete computational blueprint (implement IsO5 via Lemma 6, compute F tables, prove |A|=3 by exhibiting triples, exhaust |A|=4 via eq/opp patterns modulo S4 using brute force and the ansatz) was provided.

## round-0004 — model summary — 2025-08-27T15:19:47.824931Z
Kept the CSP reduction and one‑point amalgamation framework from output.md/notes.md; the remaining decision is the |A|=4 one‑point step which determines AP. This round produced three concrete lemmas: Lemma 10 rules out (+++) and (---) in the opposite‑fixed case (F(+,-) and symmetric), Lemma 11 shows a uniform 2+2− vertex‑sign assignment on K_4 forces every triangle triple to be of type (+−−) (up to order), and Lemma 12 reduces the entire |A|=4 one‑point amalgamation to two explicit IsO5 membership checks: (+−−)∈F(+,+) and (+−−)∈F(+,-) (with the other two cases following by symmetry). The round gives a tiny, auditable computational plan: implement IsO5, run two 8‑evaluation tests, conclude AP if both pass, otherwise run the planned 2^6 brute‑force CSP to find a witness or UNSAT certificate. Unit tests and symmetry clarifications to aid verification are provided. (Files relied on: prover-01.out.json (progress_md); background: notes.md, output.md.)

## round-0005 — model summary — 2025-08-27T15:49:00.620791Z
Round goal: decide amalgamation for class H by reducing to one-point amalgamation; the hard case is |A|=4, a 6-variable CSP with four local 5-set constraints avoiding O_5. Corrections: fix the 5-coordinate ordering per notes.md for reproducibility. Main progress: closed |A|=3 with explicit assignments for all (α,β) cases giving p(Y) ∈ {C5, −C5, H5, −H5}. For |A|=4 provided concrete 2+2-ansatz instances (P1,P2,P3) using w=(+,+,−,−) and x_{ij}=w_iw_j that produce a minimal audit set of four 5-vectors to test by IsO5: (+,+,−,−,+), (+,+,+,−,−), (+,−,−,−,+), (+,−,+,−,−). Action plan: implement IsO5, test these vectors, compute F(+,+) and F(+,−) (derive others by sign flip), and check whether all permutations of (+,−,−) lie in each F to validate the uniform 2+2 solution; otherwise run the 2^6 brute-force CSP. Verifier verdict: success. Citations: prover-01.out.json; output.md; notes.md.

## round-0006 — model summary — 2025-08-27T19:47:08.856775Z
Round 0006 introduced a small, auditable unconditional lemma (UB) that reduces the |A|=4 one‑point CSP to two tiny 8‑entry local tables: if each triangle forbids ≤1 triple then the 6‑variable instance is satisfiable by a union‑bound count. A sharp O5‑image formula (p' = −ε off one coordinate) was proved to speed IsO5 membership tests. The 2+2 vertex‑sign ansatz (x_{ij}=w_iw_j) was sharpened: if certain (+,−,−) permutations lie in the local F(α,β) tables then Prop.11 yields a uniform solution; weaker, concrete prerequisites were distilled (Prop.11′). Structural lemmas (T, D, P) classify 5‑types as constant vs 2+2 on A, control which triangle‑triples appear under w choices, and give an even‑parity constraint on triangle products — all shrink the brute‑force search. A remaining, decisive computational task is to run IsO5 and populate F(+,+),F(+,−); note a discrepancy in the notes about whether (+++)∈F(+,−) (claimed excluded in one draft, later retracted), so enumeration is needed.

## round-0007 — model summary — 2025-08-27T20:01:10.730080Z
Round 0007 produced rigorous, implementable criteria for deciding O5‑membership and a concrete, minimal pipeline to finish the |A|=4 one‑point step. Two complementary oracle tests were given (a Hamming‑1 reformulation and an inner‑product −3 test against the ε‑set E), plus a cocycle and generator description of ε(τ) that makes enumerating E (and the stronger pair set S={(ε(τ),τ(1))}) fast and auditable. A crucial correction was recorded: an ε‑only test can give false positives — membership must use the paired i0=τ(1) (the S‑oracle). Immediate rigorous exclusions in the local F‑tables were derived (e.g. (+++) ∉ F(+,-) and all permutations of (++−) are excluded from F(+,+)), which implies the union‑bound route cannot settle |A|=4. The round ends with a short, decisive computational blueprint: build S, implement IsO5, populate F(+,+)/F(+,-), then either apply the 2+2 ansatz (Prop. 11) or exhaust the tiny 6‑variable CSP with parity pruning.

## round-0008 — model summary — 2025-08-27T20:16:43.832984Z
Round 0008 produced three complementary prover notes that sharply reduce the remaining computation needed to close the |A|=4 step. New rigorous lemmas (21–23) extract internal S5-induced symmetries: a swap (12) yields central symmetry F(α,α), two internal generators (S3,S4) act on the last three coordinates, and their composition gives the x↔z swap. These symmetries partition {±1}^3 into small orbits and cut each base table to at most four representatives. Practically, the 2+2 vertex‑sign ansatz requires only two decisive membership checks ( (+,−,−) in F(+,+) and in F(+,−) ), or a slightly weaker feasibility check on the realized multiset of pair‑types. The round also produced auditable explicit witnesses: a product‑of‑entries invariant ∏ p_i = sgn(τ) for O5, a certified forbidden triple (++−)∉F(+,−) (τ=(12)(34)), and (−,+,+)∉F(+,+) (τ=(13)). A subtle bookkeeping correction was made: ε alone is not enough—i0 must be tracked via the τ witness (Lemma 20). Next steps are to implement/validate IsO5, run symmetry unit tests, evaluate the decisive entries, and fall back to the tiny 2^6 CSP/backtracking only if needed.
