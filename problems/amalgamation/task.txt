An n-hypertournament is a structure with one n-ary relation R which is injective (that is, there are no tuples with repeated occurrences of vertices in R) such that every substructure on n vertices is preserved precisely by the even permutations. In other words, a structure (A,R), where R is an n-ary relation, is an n-hypertournament if the following three conditions are satisfied:

1) If (x_1, ..., x_n) \in R then x_1, ..., x_n are pairwise distinct.
2) If (x_1, ..., x_n) \in R and \sigma is an even permutation of {1,...,n} then (x_{\sigma(1)}, ..., x_{\sigma(n)}) \in R.
3) For every distinct x_1, x_2, ..., x_n of A it holds that exactly one of (x_1, x_2, x_3, ..., x_n) and (x_2, x_1, x_3, ..., x_n) is in R.

Now, given an n-hypertournament (A,R) with vertex set A = {1,...,n+1}, one can concisely describe it by recording for which i \in A it holds that the tuple (1,...,i-1,i+1,...,n+1), which contains all vertices of A except i in the natural order, is in the relation R; we call these the POSITIVE vertices. It turns out that there are only a few (namely ceil((n+2)/2)) isomorphism types of n-hypertournaments on n+1 vertices. For n = 4, they are the following three (we assume that their vertex set is {1,...,n+1} and, in accordance with the previous sentence, we describe them by the set of positive vertices):

1) C_5, for which the set of positive vertices is empty. (Note, however, that with a different enumeration, one could also describe C_5 by having all vertices positive, or for example by having precisely positive vertices {1,2}, and there are many more possibilities, all of which are isomorphic as 4-hypertournaments.)
2) O_5, for which only the vertex 2 is positive. (Again, there are many more descriptions based on what enumeration of the vertex set one chooses.)
3) H_5, for which the set of positive vertices is {1,3,5} (equivalently, one could also have the set of positive vertices be {2,4}, these are the only possibilities).

Next, let H be the class of all finite 4-hypertournaments with no substructure isomorphic to O_5. Your task is to decide whether H has the amalgamation property. That is, is the following statement true:

For every A, B, C in H such that A is an (induced) substructure of B and C and B \cap C = A (that is, B and C only share vertices of A) is there D in H such that both B and C are substructures of D (that is, the inclusions are embeddings, so note in particular that A is also a substructure of D and that the copies of B and C in D "overlap" at least over A).
