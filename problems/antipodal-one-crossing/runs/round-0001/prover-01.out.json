  "progress_md": "Status and reading\n- I did not receive output.md or notes.md in this round; I cannot audit curated results. I focus on the task.tex and Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s paper (EJC 2020) to make incremental, checkable progress.\n\nRecap of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s parameterization\n- The modified-geodesic scheme partitions a random antipodal geodesic into Q3-blocks and uses a local map f to rewire inside each block. The expected number of switches becomes\n  E[switches] \u2264 (1/3 + b/12 + o(1)) n,\n  where b is the probability that two uniformly random neighboring Q3\u2019s (sharing exactly one vertex) are of mixed type (one good, one bad). Dvo\u0159\u00e1k proved b \u2264 1/2 + o(1), giving (3/8 + o(1))n. Any constant improvement must force b \u2264 1/2 \u2212 \u03b3 for some absolute \u03b3 > 0 (unless one redesigns the scheme at a larger scale).\n\nGap in brainstorming item 1 (block-expander dichotomy)\n- Claim in task.tex: \u201cIf a color occupies at least an \u03b5-fraction of each \u03b4S_J for (1\u2212\u03b8) of the blocks, then that color has conductance \u2126(\u03b5).\u201d This is false in general.\n- Counterexample (fully explicit; checkable): Fix n and \u03b5 \u2208 (0,1/2). For each direction i \u2208 [n], choose a pairwise-disjoint set A_i \u2282 {0,1}^{n\u22121} of size \u03b5\u00b72^{n\u22121}. Color an edge (x, x \u2295 e_i) blue iff the projection of x onto coordinates [n]\\{i} lies in A_i; otherwise color it red. Then for every block J, the blue fraction across \u03b4S_J (the union of directions i \u2208 J) is exactly \u03b5, so the premise holds with \u03b8 = 0. However, the blue subgraph is a disjoint union of matchings (every vertex is incident to at most one blue edge because the A_i are disjoint), hence it has zero conductance. Therefore the \u201cdeliverable sublemma\u201d is invalid without additional pseudorandomness or degree-spread assumptions.\n- Consequence: The \u201cCase A\u201d estimate \u201cO(\u03b5|J|) off-color edges per biased block\u201d also lacks justification. Even if \u03b2_J = 1/2 + \u03b5 at the block scale, one can realize this with each direction i having exactly 1/2 + \u03b5 fraction blue; then any geodesic that flips each i once sees \u2248 (1/2 \u2212 \u03b5)m minority edges on average, not O(\u03b5m). Without extra structure (e.g., many near-monochromatic directions within the block), the proposed O(\u03b5m) bound is not achievable.\n\nCorrected formulation (what would be sufficient)\n- A plausible, fixable version would require both:\n  (i) per-direction bias within \u201cgood\u201d blocks: for at least (1\u2212\u03b8) blocks J, each direction i \u2208 J has blue fraction in [1/2 + \u03b5, 1] or [0, 1/2 \u2212 \u03b5]; and\n  (ii) vertex-level spread: every vertex is incident to at least \u03c1m blue edges from these directions for some fixed \u03c1 > 0 (ruling out disjoint concentration as in the counterexample).\n- Under (i)+(ii), a matrix-Chernoff/random-walk argument on the sum of many (partially) present matchings could give a conductance lower bound \u03a6 = \u2126(\u03b5\u03c1), yielding a long monochromatic burst and fewer switches. This is a new sublemma to be proven; current task: formalize an expander bound from degree and per-matching density lower bounds under adversarial placement (nontrivial because independence is absent). One candidate route: canonical paths that use, for each coordinate, the present-blue matching with probability \u2265 \u03b5 and exploit that each vertex has \u2265 \u03c1m available blue directions.\n\nTowards reducing b below 1/2\n- Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s bound b \u2264 1/2 + o(1) was obtained by, for each vertex v, letting s(v) be the number of good Q3\u2019s containing v and observing that the fraction of good\u2013bad v-neighbor pairs is at most s(v)(k\u2212s(v)) with k = C(n,3), maximized at s(v)=k/2. To beat 1/2 one needs extra constraints coupling the types of different triples through shared edges/4-cycles.\n- Key observation: The dependence of type(T) on the coloring enforces monotone constraints beyond \u201cmonochromatic star \u21d2 good.\u201d For a fixed v, the type function T_v on 3-subsets of [n] is not arbitrary; it must satisfy many local consistency relations (e.g., coming from the bad-Q3 structure Lemma 9 and from overlaps with other vertices of the same Q3). Exploiting these should lower the extremal good\u2013bad mixing below the naive s(k\u2212s) bound.\n\nAuditable plan: a local LP/SDP bound for b\n- Variables: For a fixed vertex v, let p_{abc} be the frequency over 3-sets I \u2282 [n] of the color-pattern at v on the three incident edges in directions I, where a,b,c \u2208 {R,B} in some canonical order. Enforce the exact marginals determined by the degree at v: P(3R)=C(r_v,3)/C(n,3), P(3B)=C(n\u2212r_v,3)/C(n,3), and the sums over 2R1B, 1R2B follow combinatorially.\n- Enrich with 4-cycle constraints: For any pair of directions i\u2260j, and a third k, the joint distributions across the two Q3\u2019s with triples {i,j,k} and {i,j,k\u2032} must be compatible with the coloring on the 4-cycle generated by i and j. This couples p-distributions for different k,k\u2032.\n- Add \u201cbadness filters\u201d from Lemma 9: for a bad Q3, from each vertex v there must exist exactly-one-change antipodal geodesics with prescribed colors at v and v\u2032. Encode this as linear constraints on the frequencies with which a 3-set is classified as bad given its edge-colors at all 8 vertices (the latter determined by the global edge-coloring restricted to the Q3).\n- Objective: Maximize the expected proportion of good\u2013bad neighbor pairs b_v at v over all feasible distributions; then average v. Any universal upper bound strictly below 1/2 gives the desired \u03b3. This is implementable as a relaxation (LP or small SDP) on the local configuration space (dimension controlled by the number of edge-color patterns on Q3 up to symmetry). Deliverable: set up the constraint system and solve numerically to detect a gap \u03b3 > 0, then try to certify analytically a positive margin.\n\nSmall, checkable computations that feed the LP\n- Per-vertex lower bound on good Q3\u2019s: For r_v red degree at v, the fraction of 3-sets yielding a monochromatic star is\n  \u03c4_v = [C(r_v,3)+C(n\u2212r_v,3)] / C(n,3) = x^3+(1\u2212x)^3 + O(1/n), with x=r_v/n.\n  Minimizing in x gives \u03c4_v \u2265 1/4 \u2212 3/(4n) + O(1/n^2). This refines Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s \u201c\u2265 1/4 \u2212 o(1)\u201d and quantifies the o(1) term; it feeds into the good\u2013good boundary switch bound but, by itself, cannot beat 1/2.\n\nConditional improvement via vertex-bias (a structural lemma)\n- Define, for a good Q3 containing v, the \u201csuggested color at v,\u201d \u03c3 \u2208 {R,B}, as the color of the first edge in (v, f(v,w)). For v with red-degree fraction x, the bias among the good triples that are monochromatic at v is proportional to x^3\u2212(1\u2212x)^3 = (2x\u22121)(1/2\u2212x(1\u2212x)). Thus, if a positive fraction of vertices have |2x\u22121| \u2265 \u03b7, then among good\u2013good neighbor pairs at those v the disagreement probability drops below 1/2 by a quantity \u2126(\u03b7), improving the boundary contribution. This yields a conditional bound of the form\n  E[switches] \u2264 (3/8 \u2212 c\u00b7E_v[|2r_v/n \u2212 1|]) n + o(n).\n  This is checkable once one quantifies how often f(v,w) is driven by the monochromatic-star mechanism among good Q3\u2019s. The obstruction: there exist colorings with r_v\u2261n/2 (balanced at every vertex), so unconditional gains cannot rely on vertex-star bias alone.\n\nToy counterexamples and sanity tests\n- The \u201cdisjoint A_i\u201d construction shows block-level density guarantees do not imply expansion or easy phase clustering. It also shows that any argument requiring O(\u03b5m) minority edges per block must use stronger per-direction or per-vertex assumptions.\n- Balanced-at-every-vertex constructions (deg_R(v) \u2261 n/2) plausibly exist; in such colorings, per-vertex label biases vanish, so good\u2013good boundary disagreement can be \u2248 1/2. Any unconditional improvement must therefore act through inter-triple consistency constraints (the proposed LP/SDP plan).\n\nNext steps (actionable)\n1) Formalize and solve the local LP: enumerate Q3 edge-colorings up to isomorphism; identify \u201cgood\u201d vs \u201cbad\u201d as in Dvo\u0159\u00e1k; introduce variables for frequencies of these patterns across the hypercube under the restriction that pairs sharing a vertex are coupled by 4-cycles. Compute the maximal b over feasible distributions. Even a numerical \u03b3 \u2248 10^{-3} would guide the analytic step.\n2) Prove a strengthened \u201cno-tiling-by-bads\u201d lemma: show that for any fixed vertex v, among the 3-sets I disjoint from a fixed 3-set J, the indicator that Q3(v,I) is bad cannot be independent of Q3(v,J) being bad; quantify a negative correlation. This would directly lower b.\n3) Explore Q4-block variant: Define \u201cgood Q4\u201d and a corresponding f with improved boundary synchronization, aiming to replace the b/12 term by (b\u2032/12) with b\u2032 < b. Start with computational exploration on Q4 patterns.\n4) Salvage block-phase under strengthened hypotheses: formulate and prove a lemma that if in at least (1\u2212\u03b8) blocks each direction has per-direction bias \u2265 \u03b5 and each vertex sees \u2265 \u03c1m majority-color edges within those blocks, then one phase yields O((1/m)+\u03b8+(1\u2212\u03b8)(1\u2212\u03b5\u03c1)) n switches. This will be a stand-alone result useful in a hybrid approach.\n\nSummary of progress this round\n- Identified and rigorously refuted a key sublemma in the brainstorm (expansion from block-thick density), with an explicit counterexample that also invalidates the O(\u03b5m) minority-edge claim.\n- Clarified that improving the (3/8) constant within Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s framework hinges on proving b \u2264 1/2 \u2212 \u03b3 and proposed a concrete, auditable LP/SDP program to capture necessary local constraints beyond the vertex-star bound.\n- Provided refined per-vertex counting bounds and a conditional structural lemma showing how vertex bias would reduce boundary disagreement (useful in structural case analyses).\n- Outlined concrete next steps (computational and analytic) to move toward a constant \u03b3 > 0.\n"
