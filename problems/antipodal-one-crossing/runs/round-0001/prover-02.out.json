Then in every direction i and every block J we have exactly half of the edges blue, i.e. \u03b2_J = 1/2 for all J. Yet the blue subgraph has all odd-parity vertices isolated (degree 0), hence conductance 0 and is disconnected. Therefore, occupying a constant fraction of each \u03b4S_J does not imply any expansion or even connectivity. The obstruction is concentration on one bipartition side per direction.\n- Conclusion: Any usable block-to-expansion lemma must include a \u201cbalanced across endpoints\u201d condition (e.g. per-direction, blue edges incident to each bipartition side in the block must form a constant fraction), not just an aggregate fraction across \u03b4S_J.\n\n2) Case A \u201cChernoff\u201d bound in approach 1 is not valid as written.\n- Notes say: In a biased block J with \u03b2_J \u2209 [1/2\u2212\u03b5, 1/2+\u03b5], a random start and random ordering yields O(\u03b5|J|) off-color edges, then 4-cycle commuting clusters defects and total switches \u2264 T + O(\u03b5 n).\n- Issue: For a uniformly random start x and random ordering of the |J| directions, the i-edge encountered is uniformly distributed among all i-edges, so the expected number of blue edges encountered equals \u03b2_J|J| and red equals (1\u2212\u03b2_J)|J|. If blue is the \u201cmajority,\u201d the expected off-color count is (1\u2212\u03b2_J)|J|, which is \u2248 (1/2\u2212\u03b5)|J| when \u03b2_J = 1/2+\u03b5 \u2014 not O(\u03b5|J|). Concentration inequalities do not apply directly here because these are m dependent edge-indicators evaluated at the same random vertex x.\n- Even existence via the method of conditional expectation only guarantees there is an order achieving at most the expectation (\u2248 (1/2\u2212\u03b5)|J| off-color edges in the mild-bias regime), not O(\u03b5|J|). So the proposed inequality is overly optimistic.\n\n3) Why a naive \u201cp-density of good Q3\u2019s\u201d cannot improve 3/8 by itself.\n- In Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s analysis, after defining p (fraction of good Q3), a (probability two random neighboring Q3 are both good), and b (probability one good, one bad), the final expected bound simplifies to (1/3 + b/12 + o(1))n using p = a + b/2. Thus p cancels out. Any plan focusing only on raising p above 1/2 (approach 2 as currently phrased) does not directly improve the constant; one must lower b strictly below 1/2 (or reduce the \u201ca-case\u201d boundary change probability below 1/2).\n\nSmall rigorized lemmas and bounds\nA) Vertex-wise Kneser (disjointness) graph viewpoint and a clean upper bound on mixed pairs.\n- Setup: For a fixed vertex v, Q3-subcubes through v correspond to 3-subsets K \u2282 [n] (directions). Two such Q3\u2019s are v-neighbors iff K1 \u2229 K2 = \u2205. This is the Kneser graph KG(n,3) on vertices V = {K \u2282 [n]: |K|=3}, edges between disjoint triples. Let N = |V| = C(n,3), degree d = C(n\u22123,3).\n- For a given coloring, let G_v \u2286 V be the set of good triples at v; then b_v is the fraction of edges in KG(n,3) that cross the cut (G_v, V\\G_v). Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s \u201cb\u201d is the average over vertices of b_v, up to the normalization between ordered/unordered pairs (which cancels in fractions).\n- Spectral MAX-CUT bound (standard): For any d-regular graph with smallest eigenvalue \u03bb_min, the maximum cut has at most |E|\u00b7(1/2)(1\u2212\u03bb_min/d) edges. For KG(n,3), the spectrum is known: eigenvalues are \u03bb_0 = d, \u03bb_1 = \u2212C(n\u22124,2), \u03bb_2 = n\u22125, \u03bb_3 = \u22121. Hence \u03bb_min = \u2212C(n\u22124,2).\n- Therefore, for every v and every choice of G_v,\n  b_v \u2264 1/2 \u00b7 (1 \u2212 \u03bb_min/d) = 1/2 \u00b7 (1 + C(n\u22124,2)/C(n\u22123,3)).\n  Since C(n\u22124,2)/C(n\u22123,3) = 3/(n\u22123),\n  b_v \u2264 1/2 + 3/(2(n\u22123)).\n- Averaging over v gives the same bound for b up to o(1/n) bookkeeping. This recovers and slightly sharpens Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s b \u2264 1/2 + o(1), giving an explicit o(1) term. It also clarifies the structural limitation: vertex-wise information alone cannot force b \u2264 1/2\u2212\u03b3 for absolute \u03b3.\n- Usefulness here: This pins down what extra (non-vertexwise) structure must be exploited to beat 3/8: correlations among the labels G_v across different vertices/edges, not captured by per-vertex cuts, are necessary.\n\nB) Formal \u201cno-go\u201d lemma for naive block-conductance.\n- Statement: There exist 2-colorings for which, for every block partition {J_t}, every block J satisfies \u03b2_J = 1/2 (blue occupies half of \u03b4S_J), yet the blue subgraph is disconnected (indeed, has 2^{n\u22121} isolated vertices) and has conductance 0.\n- Proof: The parity coloring described above has b_i(x) = 1 iff \u27e8x,1^n\u27e9 mod 2 = 0 for every direction i. Then exactly half of i-edges are blue for every i, whence \u03b2_J = 1/2 for all J. But odd-parity vertices have zero blue degree, so the blue subgraph is disconnected. QED.\n- Usefulness here: Clarifies that any block-expansion lemma must additionally control endpoint-balance per direction (or within-block bipartition balance), not just overall fractions.\n\nRefined ideas targeting the boundary term (the parameter b)\nIdea I: Replace the per-vertex trivial cut bound with constraints across vertices via 4-cycle consistency.\n- Observation: The good/bad status of Q3(v,K) depends on the colors of edges both through v and away from v. Two disjoint triples K1,K2 at v involve disjoint sets of directions; hence many 4-cycles and 3-faces touching v and those directions mediate dependencies between \u201cgood at K1\u201d and \u201cgood at K2\u201d. The per-vertex MAX-CUT bound treats G_v as an arbitrary subset of triples, ignoring these constraints.\n- Plan (LP/SDP framework): Introduce variables for frequencies of local patterns around v on:\n  \u2022 1-edge statistics at v: the color of each direction i.\n  \u2022 2-edge statistics at v: for unordered pairs {i,j}, the multiset of colors on the 4-cycle through v in directions i,j (there are only a few 2-color isomorphism types), capturing parity constraints.\n  \u2022 3-edge statistics: the 2-coloring type of Q3(v,K), with a flag good/bad and, for good, the color at v chosen by f1.\n- Impose consistency constraints: marginalization (3-edge types project to 2-edge and 1-edge types), and that for each fixed {i,j}, all four Q3 containing {i,j} at v aggregate consistently with the 4-cycle type. Also enforce that across a uniformly random direction set, distributions are invariant. Finally, encode that pairs (K1,K2) disjoint at v induce the boundary change indicator using the chosen colors for f1.\n- Objective: Maximize b (probability of good-bad among disjoint pairs) plus the \u201cboth-good boundary switch\u201d probability, to reproduce Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s boundary analysis with the extra structural constraints. The hope: these constraints force b strictly below 1/2.\n- Auditable next step: Enumerate the finite type spaces explicitly (number of 2-edge types at v is small; number of Q3 types up to automorphism is also small), write the linear constraints, and solve the LP numerically to obtain a candidate \u03b3 > 0. If obtained, this gives a concrete target to then re-prove combinatorially.\n\nIdea II: Classify Q3 patterns more finely to reduce the \u201ca-case\u201d bound below 1/2.\n- In Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s proof, when both neighboring Q3\u2019s are good (probability a), the probability of a boundary color switch at the common vertex is bounded by 1/2 + o(1). This is where structural savings may be hidden: for good Q3\u2019s, the choice of f1 is not arbitrary; it tends to align with the majority color at the shared vertex in that Q3 (anchoring at a monochromatic star when present, see Lemma 8). Disjoint good cubes\u2019 preferences may align more than random, leading to \u2264 1/2 \u2212 \u03b7 for some absolute \u03b7.\n- Concrete step: Enumerate good Q3 isomorphism classes; for each class and a marked vertex, compute c_v (the color at v chosen by f1 in that Q3). Show that for two independent disjoint good cubes, P[c_v differ] \u2264 1/2 \u2212 \u03b7. Then the \u201ca-term\u201d contribution in Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s bound becomes (1/2 \u2212 \u03b7 + o(1)) a, improving the constant.\n- Why plausible: The anchored-good subclass (Lemma 8) contributes a positive mass where c_v equals the common color at v; when degrees at v are slightly imbalanced these dominate. Even in the balanced case, the structure of bad patterns (Lemma 9) implies that good patterns have a constrained \u201cpreferred color\u201d at v. This can be tested computationally for Q3.\n\nModest but checkable auxiliary computations\n- Re-derive the exact coefficient that Dvo\u0159\u00e1k bounds in the \u201ca-case.\u201d In the paper (p. 5\u20136), the 1/2 + o(1) arises by a crude bound treating pairs of good v-neighbors that share another vertex as negligible. A tighter local counting (still within good Q3\u2019s) may already give a c/n improvement in the \u201ca-term.\u201d While asymptotically negligible for our target, it will validate the direction and help calibrate the LP in Idea I.\n\nExamples to stress-test claims\n- Parity coloring (defined above):\n  \u2022 All blocks have \u03b2_J = 1/2; the blue subgraph is disconnected: demonstrates failure of naive conductance claims.\n  \u2022 Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s scheme applied here: almost surely a monochromatic antipodal path exists when n is even (choose blue if start and end in even parity class), but not necessarily via geodesics; confirms that the method\u2019s lower-level constants must be disentangled from global connectivity phenomena.\n\nNext steps (concrete, auditable)\n1) Q3 pattern enumeration and \u201cpreferred color map\u201d at a vertex.\n- Task: List all 2-colorings of Q3 up to automorphism, mark the isomorphism classes that are good/bad (using Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s definition), and for each good class and marked vertex identify the color at the marked vertex selected by f1 (minimal changes; fix a deterministic tie-break). Output: a table of classes with weights.\n- Deliverable: For two independent random good Q3\u2019s at v with disjoint direction sets (approximating independence), compute the probability their f1-colors at v differ. If this is \u2264 1/2 \u2212 \u03b7 for some \u03b7 > 0, draft a lemma capturing this bias. If not, record the counterexample pattern mix.\n\n2) LP bound for b using local consistency.\n- Task: Set up a linear program over the frequencies of: (i) per-vertex degree of blue; (ii) per-pair 4-cycle type frequencies at v; (iii) Q3 pattern frequencies at v. Impose marginal constraints and consistency of pairs of disjoint triples at v. Maximize b subject to these constraints to test if b \u2264 1/2 \u2212 \u03b3 is forced by local structure. Start with a reduced symmetry model (assume per-vertex blue degree equals n/2) to simplify.\n\n3) Repair of approach 1 (block phase) via endpoint-balance conditions.\n- Task: Formulate and prove a corrected lemma: If in a block J and for each direction i \u2208 J the set {x \u2208 {0,1}^n : the i-edge at x is blue} has density in [\u03b5, 1\u2212\u03b5] and additionally its correlation with the block-parity function p_J is at most 1\u22122\u03b5, then the blue subgraph restricted to coordinates in J is connected within each coset of the other coordinates. Sketch a proof via expansion of a product of matchings with endpoint balance, or point out the precise obstacle.\n- Usefulness: Even if this does not directly lead to a global \u03b4, it will clarify what endpoint-balance one must enforce to get monochromatic long runs.\n\n4) Document the exact dependence on b in Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s bound and isolate where boundary improvements can be inserted.\n- Task: Rewrite the final inequality as switches \u2264 (1/3 + b/12 + \u03c6)a + \u03c8 with explicit \u03c6,\u03c8 capturing the \u201ca-case\u201d boundary term. Identify the component where replacing 1/2 by 1/2 \u2212 \u03b7 moves the final constant by \u03b7\u00b7(a/3). This will quantify how large an \u03b7 is needed for a given lower bound on a.\n\nWhy these steps are promising\n- They target the only parameter that matters in Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s calculation (b), or the only loose bound (the 1/2 in the a-case), and they incorporate cross-cube constraints (4-cycles and consistency) that weren\u2019t used in the 3/8 bound. Either an LP certifies a strict gap or it produces extremal local statistics guiding a human proof.\n\nPotential obstacles\n- Independence assumptions between disjoint triples at v are false; the LP must encode enough consistency without exploding in size. Start with a relaxation.\n- Ties in the f1 choice for good Q3\u2019s must be resolved canonically to keep the model deterministic; otherwise adversarial tie-breaking could push probabilities toward 1/2.\n- Even a verified \u03b7 > 0 for the a-case might be offset by an adversarial increase in b; the LP must optimize both simultaneously.\n\nClosing\n- Immediate action items: (1) Implement Q3 pattern classification and compute c_v biases for good Q3\u2019s; (2) Draft the LP skeleton and test a symmetric relaxation (n large, per-vertex blue degree n/2) to probe whether b \u2264 1/2 \u2212 \u03b3 is plausible under local constraints.\n"
