  "summary_md": "In this round, several claims were explored regarding the expander vs. sparse-cut dichotomy, Q3 density improvements, local surgery techniques, Fourier/junta stability, and refined random-geodesic coupling. Each claim presents potential benefits for reducing switches in biased blocks but lacks rigorous justification or empirical validation. Notably, the conductance claim requires a stronger connection to block size, while the Q3 density claim assumes uniformity without addressing specific colorings. Local surgery and Fourier/junta stability claims need more detailed combinatorial arguments and clearer connections to switch reduction. The refined random-geodesic coupling remains speculative and requires further empirical testing.",
  "highlights": [
    "Conductance claim suggests that if a color occupies at least an \u03c1-fraction of each 1/\u03b8 of the blocks, it has conductance \u03a9(\u03c1) in the whole cube.",
    "Q3 density claim indicates that the fraction of good Q3's exceeds 1/2 + \u03b7 for some absolute \u03b7 > 0, potentially improving expected savings.",
    "Local surgery claim states that the number of switches is \u2264 (2 + o(1))\u03c1n, providing a method to reduce switches in nearly monochromatic segments.",
    "Fourier/junta stability claim suggests that boundary measure concentrates on a small set of coordinates, leading to a long single-color burst.",
    "Refined random-geodesic coupling aims to bias the distribution toward orders that maximize overlap with biased blocks."
