  "summary_md": "Round summary: The round critically reviewed brainstormed approaches and fixed two key errors in task.tex: (1) the block-to-expansion sublemma is false as stated (explicit parity-coloring counterexample shows \u03b2_J = 1/2 for every block yet the monochromatic subgraph is disconnected), and (2) the Chernoff-style Case A bound is incorrect (expected off-color edges in a mildly biased block are \u2248(1/2\u2212\u03b5)|J|, not O(\u03b5|J|)). It was observed that raising p (fraction of good Q3\u2019s) alone does not help because Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s formula depends on b (good\u2013bad neighbor probability); to beat 3/8 one must force b \u2264 1/2\u2212\u03b3. A refined vertex-wise spectral MAX-CUT on KG(n,3) gives b_v \u2264 1/2 + 3/(2(n\u22123)), so vertex-only constraints cannot produce an absolute \u03b3. Proposed concrete next moves: (A) enumerate Q3 colorings up to isomorphism and record the f1 \"preferred color\" at a marked vertex, (B) set up an LP/SDP over local 1/2/3-edge statistics with 4-cycle consistency and Dvo\u0159\u00e1k badness filters to test whether local constraints force b \u2264 1/2\u2212\u03b3, and (C) formulate a corrected block-expansion lemma that includes endpoint-balance.

  "highlights": [
    "Explicit counterexample: parity coloring shows per-block density \u03b2_J = 1/2 need not imply expansion or connectivity; endpoint-balance per direction is necessary.",
    "Chernoff/Case A error: for a block with bias \u03b2_J = 1/2 + \u03b5 the expected off-color count is \u2248(1/2\u2212\u03b5)|J| (not O(\u03b5|J|)), so the earlier O(\u03b5m) claim is unjustified.",
    "Raising p (fraction of good Q3\u2019s) does not alter Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s final constant; improving 3/8 requires lowering b (good\u2013bad neighbor probability) or reducing the 'a-case' disagreement below 1/2.",
    "Spectral MAX-CUT on the Kneser graph KG(n,3) at a fixed vertex yields b_v \u2264 1/2 + 3/(2(n\u22123)), refining Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s o(1) and showing vertex-wise cuts alone cannot force a constant gap \u03b3.",
    "Concrete LP/SDP plan: encode local 1/2/3-edge pattern frequencies, 4-cycle consistency, and Dvo\u0159\u00e1k badness filters as linear constraints; maximize b to see if b \u2264 1/2\u2212\u03b3 is enforced.",
    "Complementary route: enumerate Q3 isomorphism classes, compute the f1 'preferred color' at a marked vertex, and test whether two disjoint good Q3\u2019s tend to align (potentially reducing the a-term below 1/2)."

  "next_questions": [
    "Enumerate all Q3 edge-colorings up to automorphism, classify good/bad, record the f1 chosen color at a marked vertex, and compute the empirical bias between two disjoint good Q3\u2019s.",
    "Formulate and solve the local LP/SDP with marginalization and 4-cycle consistency (start with symmetric/relaxed model) to check whether the feasible maximum b is < 1/2; if yes, extract a certificate \u03b3.",
    "State and prove a corrected block-expansion lemma that adds an endpoint-balance (per-direction/per-vertex spread) hypothesis and quantify how it yields long monochromatic runs or O(\u03b5 + \u03b8 + (1\u2212\u03b8)(1\u2212\u03b5\u03c1)) n switches."
