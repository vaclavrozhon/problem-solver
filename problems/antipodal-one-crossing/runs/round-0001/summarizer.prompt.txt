Status and reading
- I did not receive output.md or notes.md in this round; I cannot audit curated results. I focus on the task.tex and Dvořák’s paper (EJC 2020) to make incremental, checkable progress.

Recap of Dvořák’s parameterization
- The modified-geodesic scheme partitions a random antipodal geodesic into Q3-blocks and uses a local map f to rewire inside each block. The expected number of switches becomes
  E[switches] ≤ (1/3 + b/12 + o(1)) n,
  where b is the probability that two uniformly random neighboring Q3’s (sharing exactly one vertex) are of mixed type (one good, one bad). Dvořák proved b ≤ 1/2 + o(1), giving (3/8 + o(1))n. Any constant improvement must force b ≤ 1/2 − γ for some absolute γ > 0 (unless one redesigns the scheme at a larger scale).

Gap in brainstorming item 1 (block-expander dichotomy)
- Claim in task.tex: “If a color occupies at least an ε-fraction of each δS_J for (1−θ) of the blocks, then that color has conductance Ω(ε).” This is false in general.
- Counterexample (fully explicit; checkable): Fix n and ε ∈ (0,1/2). For each direction i ∈ [n], choose a pairwise-disjoint set A_i ⊂ {0,1}^{n−1} of size ε·2^{n−1}. Color an edge (x, x ⊕ e_i) blue iff the projection of x onto coordinates [n]\{i} lies in A_i; otherwise color it red. Then for every block J, the blue fraction across δS_J (the union of directions i ∈ J) is exactly ε, so the premise holds with θ = 0. However, the blue subgraph is a disjoint union of matchings (every vertex is incident to at most one blue edge because the A_i are disjoint), hence it has zero conductance. Therefore the “deliverable sublemma” is invalid without additional pseudorandomness or degree-spread assumptions.
- Consequence: The “Case A” estimate “O(ε|J|) off-color edges per biased block” also lacks justification. Even if β_J = 1/2 + ε at the block scale, one can realize this with each direction i having exactly 1/2 + ε fraction blue; then any geodesic that flips each i once sees ≈ (1/2 − ε)m minority edges on average, not O(εm). Without extra structure (e.g., many near-monochromatic directions within the block), the proposed O(εm) bound is not achievable.

Corrected formulation (what would be sufficient)
- A plausible, fixable version would require both:
  (i) per-direction bias within “good” blocks: for at least (1−θ) blocks J, each direction i ∈ J has blue fraction in [1/2 + ε, 1] or [0, 1/2 − ε]; and
  (ii) vertex-level spread: every vertex is incident to at least ρm blue edges from these directions for some fixed ρ > 0 (ruling out disjoint concentration as in the counterexample).
- Under (i)+(ii), a matrix-Chernoff/random-walk argument on the sum of many (partially) present matchings could give a conductance lower bound Φ = Ω(ερ), yielding a long monochromatic burst and fewer switches. This is a new sublemma to be proven; current task: formalize an expander bound from degree and per-matching density lower bounds under adversarial placement (nontrivial because independence is absent). One candidate route: canonical paths that use, for each coordinate, the present-blue matching with probability ≥ ε and exploit that each vertex has ≥ ρm available blue directions.

Towards reducing b below 1/2
- Dvořák’s bound b ≤ 1/2 + o(1) was obtained by, for each vertex v, letting s(v) be the number of good Q3’s containing v and observing that the fraction of good–bad v-neighbor pairs is at most s(v)(k−s(v)) with k = C(n,3), maximized at s(v)=k/2. To beat 1/2 one needs extra constraints coupling the types of different triples through shared edges/4-cycles.
- Key observation: The dependence of type(T) on the coloring enforces monotone constraints beyond “monochromatic star ⇒ good.” For a fixed v, the type function T_v on 3-subsets of [n] is not arbitrary; it must satisfy many local consistency relations (e.g., coming from the bad-Q3 structure Lemma 9 and from overlaps with other vertices of the same Q3). Exploiting these should lower the extremal good–bad mixing below the naive s(k−s) bound.

Auditable plan: a local LP/SDP bound for b
- Variables: For a fixed vertex v, let p_{abc} be the frequency over 3-sets I ⊂ [n] of the color-pattern at v on the three incident edges in directions I, where a,b,c ∈ {R,B} in some canonical order. Enforce the exact marginals determined by the degree at v: P(3R)=C(r_v,3)/C(n,3), P(3B)=C(n−r_v,3)/C(n,3), and the sums over 2R1B, 1R2B follow combinatorially.
- Enrich with 4-cycle constraints: For any pair of directions i≠j, and a third k, the joint distributions across the two Q3’s with triples {i,j,k} and {i,j,k′} must be compatible with the coloring on the 4-cycle generated by i and j. This couples p-distributions for different k,k′.
- Add “badness filters” from Lemma 9: for a bad Q3, from each vertex v there must exist exactly-one-change antipodal geodesics with prescribed colors at v and v′. Encode this as linear constraints on the frequencies with which a 3-set is classified as bad given its edge-colors at all 8 vertices (the latter determined by the global edge-coloring restricted to the Q3).
- Objective: Maximize the expected proportion of good–bad neighbor pairs b_v at v over all feasible distributions; then average v. Any universal upper bound strictly below 1/2 gives the desired γ. This is implementable as a relaxation (LP or small SDP) on the local configuration space (dimension controlled by the number of edge-color patterns on Q3 up to symmetry). Deliverable: set up the constraint system and solve numerically to detect a gap γ > 0, then try to certify analytically a positive margin.

Small, checkable computations that feed the LP
- Per-vertex lower bound on good Q3’s: For r_v red degree at v, the fraction of 3-sets yielding a monochromatic star is
  τ_v = [C(r_v,3)+C(n−r_v,3)] / C(n,3) = x^3+(1−x)^3 + O(1/n), with x=r_v/n.
  Minimizing in x gives τ_v ≥ 1/4 − 3/(4n) + O(1/n^2). This refines Dvořák’s “≥ 1/4 − o(1)” and quantifies the o(1) term; it feeds into the good–good boundary switch bound but, by itself, cannot beat 1/2.

Conditional improvement via vertex-bias (a structural lemma)
- Define, for a good Q3 containing v, the “suggested color at v,” σ ∈ {R,B}, as the color of the first edge in (v, f(v,w)). For v with red-degree fraction x, the bias among the good triples that are monochromatic at v is proportional to x^3−(1−x)^3 = (2x−1)(1/2−x(1−x)). Thus, if a positive fraction of vertices have |2x−1| ≥ η, then among good–good neighbor pairs at those v the disagreement probability drops below 1/2 by a quantity Ω(η), improving the boundary contribution. This yields a conditional bound of the form
  E[switches] ≤ (3/8 − c·E_v[|2r_v/n − 1|]) n + o(n).
  This is checkable once one quantifies how often f(v,w) is driven by the monochromatic-star mechanism among good Q3’s. The obstruction: there exist colorings with r_v≡n/2 (balanced at every vertex), so unconditional gains cannot rely on vertex-star bias alone.

Toy counterexamples and sanity tests
- The “disjoint A_i” construction shows block-level density guarantees do not imply expansion or easy phase clustering. It also shows that any argument requiring O(εm) minority edges per block must use stronger per-direction or per-vertex assumptions.
- Balanced-at-every-vertex constructions (deg_R(v) ≡ n/2) plausibly exist; in such colorings, per-vertex label biases vanish, so good–good boundary disagreement can be ≈ 1/2. Any unconditional improvement must therefore act through inter-triple consistency constraints (the proposed LP/SDP plan).

Next steps (actionable)
1) Formalize and solve the local LP: enumerate Q3 edge-colorings up to isomorphism; identify “good” vs “bad” as in Dvořák; introduce variables for frequencies of these patterns across the hypercube under the restriction that pairs sharing a vertex are coupled by 4-cycles. Compute the maximal b over feasible distributions. Even a numerical γ ≈ 10^{-3} would guide the analytic step.
2) Prove a strengthened “no-tiling-by-bads” lemma: show that for any fixed vertex v, among the 3-sets I disjoint from a fixed 3-set J, the indicator that Q3(v,I) is bad cannot be independent of Q3(v,J) being bad; quantify a negative correlation. This would directly lower b.
3) Explore Q4-block variant: Define “good Q4” and a corresponding f with improved boundary synchronization, aiming to replace the b/12 term by (b′/12) with b′ < b. Start with computational exploration on Q4 patterns.
4) Salvage block-phase under strengthened hypotheses: formulate and prove a lemma that if in at least (1−θ) blocks each direction has per-direction bias ≥ ε and each vertex sees ≥ ρm majority-color edges within those blocks, then one phase yields O((1/m)+θ+(1−θ)(1−ερ)) n switches. This will be a stand-alone result useful in a hybrid approach.

Summary of progress this round
- Identified and rigorously refuted a key sublemma in the brainstorm (expansion from block-thick density), with an explicit counterexample that also invalidates the O(εm) minority-edge claim.
- Clarified that improving the (3/8) constant within Dvořák’s framework hinges on proving b ≤ 1/2 − γ and proposed a concrete, auditable LP/SDP program to capture necessary local constraints beyond the vertex-star bound.
- Provided refined per-vertex counting bounds and a conditional structural lemma showing how vertex bias would reduce boundary disagreement (useful in structural case analyses).
- Outlined concrete next steps (computational and analytic) to move toward a constant γ > 0.

Round 0001 — Critical review of brainstormed approaches; precise counterexamples; small rigorized lemmas and a concrete plan to target the parameter b in Dvořák’s scheme

Summary of materials read
- task.tex: Problem and brainstormed approaches (1–6).
- Dvořák (2020) paper (ejc 27(2) #P2.26): Proof of the (3/8+o(1))n bound via Q3-patching; definitions of good/bad Q3, parameters p,a,b, and the resulting bound (1/3 + b/12 + o(1))n.
- There is no output.md provided; nothing to curate yet.

Gaps and corrections to notes in task.tex
1) “Deliverable sublemma” under approach 1 is false as stated.
- Claim in notes: If a color occupies at least an ε-fraction of each block boundary δS_J for (1−θ) of the blocks, then that color has conductance Ω(ε) in the whole cube (hence a monochromatic antipodal path).
- Counterexample (explicit): Color every edge (x,x⊕e_i) blue iff the Hamming parity of x is 0, and red otherwise. Then in every direction i and every block J we have exactly half of the edges blue, i.e. β_J = 1/2 for all J. Yet the blue subgraph has all odd-parity vertices isolated (degree 0), hence conductance 0 and is disconnected. Therefore, occupying a constant fraction of each δS_J does not imply any expansion or even connectivity. The obstruction is concentration on one bipartition side per direction.
- Conclusion: Any usable block-to-expansion lemma must include a “balanced across endpoints” condition (e.g. per-direction, blue edges incident to each bipartition side in the block must form a constant fraction), not just an aggregate fraction across δS_J.

2) Case A “Chernoff” bound in approach 1 is not valid as written.
- Notes say: In a biased block J with β_J ∉ [1/2−ε, 1/2+ε], a random start and random ordering yields O(ε|J|) off-color edges, then 4-cycle commuting clusters defects and total switches ≤ T + O(ε n).
- Issue: For a uniformly random start x and random ordering of the |J| directions, the i-edge encountered is uniformly distributed among all i-edges, so the expected number of blue edges encountered equals β_J|J| and red equals (1−β_J)|J|. If blue is the “majority,” the expected off-color count is (1−β_J)|J|, which is ≈ (1/2−ε)|J| when β_J = 1/2+ε — not O(ε|J|). Concentration inequalities do not apply directly here because these are m dependent edge-indicators evaluated at the same random vertex x.
- Even existence via the method of conditional expectation only guarantees there is an order achieving at most the expectation (≈ (1/2−ε)|J| off-color edges in the mild-bias regime), not O(ε|J|). So the proposed inequality is overly optimistic.

3) Why a naive “p-density of good Q3’s” cannot improve 3/8 by itself.
- In Dvořák’s analysis, after defining p (fraction of good Q3), a (probability two random neighboring Q3 are both good), and b (probability one good, one bad), the final expected bound simplifies to (1/3 + b/12 + o(1))n using p = a + b/2. Thus p cancels out. Any plan focusing only on raising p above 1/2 (approach 2 as currently phrased) does not directly improve the constant; one must lower b strictly below 1/2 (or reduce the “a-case” boundary change probability below 1/2).

Small rigorized lemmas and bounds
A) Vertex-wise Kneser (disjointness) graph viewpoint and a clean upper bound on mixed pairs.
- Setup: For a fixed vertex v, Q3-subcubes through v correspond to 3-subsets K ⊂ [n] (directions). Two such Q3’s are v-neighbors iff K1 ∩ K2 = ∅. This is the Kneser graph KG(n,3) on vertices V = {K ⊂ [n]: |K|=3}, edges between disjoint triples. Let N = |V| = C(n,3), degree d = C(n−3,3).
- For a given coloring, let G_v ⊆ V be the set of good triples at v; then b_v is the fraction of edges in KG(n,3) that cross the cut (G_v, V\G_v). Dvořák’s “b” is the average over vertices of b_v, up to the normalization between ordered/unordered pairs (which cancels in fractions).
- Spectral MAX-CUT bound (standard): For any d-regular graph with smallest eigenvalue λ_min, the maximum cut has at most |E|·(1/2)(1−λ_min/d) edges. For KG(n,3), the spectrum is known: eigenvalues are λ_0 = d, λ_1 = −C(n−4,2), λ_2 = n−5, λ_3 = −1. Hence λ_min = −C(n−4,2).
- Therefore, for every v and every choice of G_v,
  b_v ≤ 1/2 · (1 − λ_min/d) = 1/2 · (1 + C(n−4,2)/C(n−3,3)).
  Since C(n−4,2)/C(n−3,3) = 3/(n−3),
  b_v ≤ 1/2 + 3/(2(n−3)).
- Averaging over v gives the same bound for b up to o(1/n) bookkeeping. This recovers and slightly sharpens Dvořák’s b ≤ 1/2 + o(1), giving an explicit o(1) term. It also clarifies the structural limitation: vertex-wise information alone cannot force b ≤ 1/2−γ for absolute γ.
- Usefulness here: This pins down what extra (non-vertexwise) structure must be exploited to beat 3/8: correlations among the labels G_v across different vertices/edges, not captured by per-vertex cuts, are necessary.

B) Formal “no-go” lemma for naive block-conductance.
- Statement: There exist 2-colorings for which, for every block partition {J_t}, every block J satisfies β_J = 1/2 (blue occupies half of δS_J), yet the blue subgraph is disconnected (indeed, has 2^{n−1} isolated vertices) and has conductance 0.
- Proof: The parity coloring described above has b_i(x) = 1 iff ⟨x,1^n⟩ mod 2 = 0 for every direction i. Then exactly half of i-edges are blue for every i, whence β_J = 1/2 for all J. But odd-parity vertices have zero blue degree, so the blue subgraph is disconnected. QED.
- Usefulness here: Clarifies that any block-expansion lemma must additionally control endpoint-balance per direction (or within-block bipartition balance), not just overall fractions.

Refined ideas targeting the boundary term (the parameter b)
Idea I: Replace the per-vertex trivial cut bound with constraints across vertices via 4-cycle consistency.
- Observation: The good/bad status of Q3(v,K) depends on the colors of edges both through v and away from v. Two disjoint triples K1,K2 at v involve disjoint sets of directions; hence many 4-cycles and 3-faces touching v and those directions mediate dependencies between “good at K1” and “good at K2”. The per-vertex MAX-CUT bound treats G_v as an arbitrary subset of triples, ignoring these constraints.
- Plan (LP/SDP framework): Introduce variables for frequencies of local patterns around v on:
  • 1-edge statistics at v: the color of each direction i.
  • 2-edge statistics at v: for unordered pairs {i,j}, the multiset of colors on the 4-cycle through v in directions i,j (there are only a few 2-color isomorphism types), capturing parity constraints.
  • 3-edge statistics: the 2-coloring type of Q3(v,K), with a flag good/bad and, for good, the color at v chosen by f1.
- Impose consistency constraints: marginalization (3-edge types project to 2-edge and 1-edge types), and that for each fixed {i,j}, all four Q3 containing {i,j} at v aggregate consistently with the 4-cycle type. Also enforce that across a uniformly random direction set, distributions are invariant. Finally, encode that pairs (K1,K2) disjoint at v induce the boundary change indicator using the chosen colors for f1.
- Objective: Maximize b (probability of good-bad among disjoint pairs) plus the “both-good boundary switch” probability, to reproduce Dvořák’s boundary analysis with the extra structural constraints. The hope: these constraints force b strictly below 1/2.
- Auditable next step: Enumerate the finite type spaces explicitly (number of 2-edge types at v is small; number of Q3 types up to automorphism is also small), write the linear constraints, and solve the LP numerically to obtain a candidate γ > 0. If obtained, this gives a concrete target to then re-prove combinatorially.

Idea II: Classify Q3 patterns more finely to reduce the “a-case” bound below 1/2.
- In Dvořák’s proof, when both neighboring Q3’s are good (probability a), the probability of a boundary color switch at the common vertex is bounded by 1/2 + o(1). This is where structural savings may be hidden: for good Q3’s, the choice of f1 is not arbitrary; it tends to align with the majority color at the shared vertex in that Q3 (anchoring at a monochromatic star when present, see Lemma 8). Disjoint good cubes’ preferences may align more than random, leading to ≤ 1/2 − η for some absolute η.
- Concrete step: Enumerate good Q3 isomorphism classes; for each class and a marked vertex, compute c_v (the color at v chosen by f1 in that Q3). Show that for two independent disjoint good cubes, P[c_v differ] ≤ 1/2 − η. Then the “a-term” contribution in Dvořák’s bound becomes (1/2 − η + o(1)) a, improving the constant.
- Why plausible: The anchored-good subclass (Lemma 8) contributes a positive mass where c_v equals the common color at v; when degrees at v are slightly imbalanced these dominate. Even in the balanced case, the structure of bad patterns (Lemma 9) implies that good patterns have a constrained “preferred color” at v. This can be tested computationally for Q3.

Modest but checkable auxiliary computations
- Re-derive the exact coefficient that Dvořák bounds in the “a-case.” In the paper (p. 5–6), the 1/2 + o(1) arises by a crude bound treating pairs of good v-neighbors that share another vertex as negligible. A tighter local counting (still within good Q3’s) may already give a c/n improvement in the “a-term.” While asymptotically negligible for our target, it will validate the direction and help calibrate the LP in Idea I.

Examples to stress-test claims
- Parity coloring (defined above):
  • All blocks have β_J = 1/2; the blue subgraph is disconnected: demonstrates failure of naive conductance claims.
  • Dvořák’s scheme applied here: almost surely a monochromatic antipodal path exists when n is even (choose blue if start and end in even parity class), but not necessarily via geodesics; confirms that the method’s lower-level constants must be disentangled from global connectivity phenomena.

Next steps (concrete, auditable)
1) Q3 pattern enumeration and “preferred color map” at a vertex.
- Task: List all 2-colorings of Q3 up to automorphism, mark the isomorphism classes that are good/bad (using Dvořák’s definition), and for each good class and marked vertex identify the color at the marked vertex selected by f1 (minimal changes; fix a deterministic tie-break). Output: a table of classes with weights.
- Deliverable: For two independent random good Q3’s at v with disjoint direction sets (approximating independence), compute the probability their f1-colors at v differ. If this is ≤ 1/2 − η for some η > 0, draft a lemma capturing this bias. If not, record the counterexample pattern mix.

2) LP bound for b using local consistency.
- Task: Set up a linear program over the frequencies of: (i) per-vertex degree of blue; (ii) per-pair 4-cycle type frequencies at v; (iii) Q3 pattern frequencies at v. Impose marginal constraints and consistency of pairs of disjoint triples at v. Maximize b subject to these constraints to test if b ≤ 1/2 − γ is forced by local structure. Start with a reduced symmetry model (assume per-vertex blue degree equals n/2) to simplify.

3) Repair of approach 1 (block phase) via endpoint-balance conditions.
- Task: Formulate and prove a corrected lemma: If in a block J and for each direction i ∈ J the set {x ∈ {0,1}^n : the i-edge at x is blue} has density in [ε, 1−ε] and additionally its correlation with the block-parity function p_J is at most 1−2ε, then the blue subgraph restricted to coordinates in J is connected within each coset of the other coordinates. Sketch a proof via expansion of a product of matchings with endpoint balance, or point out the precise obstacle.
- Usefulness: Even if this does not directly lead to a global δ, it will clarify what endpoint-balance one must enforce to get monochromatic long runs.

4) Document the exact dependence on b in Dvořák’s bound and isolate where boundary improvements can be inserted.
- Task: Rewrite the final inequality as switches ≤ (1/3 + b/12 + φ)a + ψ with explicit φ,ψ capturing the “a-case” boundary term. Identify the component where replacing 1/2 by 1/2 − η moves the final constant by η·(a/3). This will quantify how large an η is needed for a given lower bound on a.

Why these steps are promising
- They target the only parameter that matters in Dvořák’s calculation (b), or the only loose bound (the 1/2 in the a-case), and they incorporate cross-cube constraints (4-cycles and consistency) that weren’t used in the 3/8 bound. Either an LP certifies a strict gap or it produces extremal local statistics guiding a human proof.

Potential obstacles
- Independence assumptions between disjoint triples at v are false; the LP must encode enough consistency without exploding in size. Start with a relaxation.
- Ties in the f1 choice for good Q3’s must be resolved canonically to keep the model deterministic; otherwise adversarial tie-breaking could push probabilities toward 1/2.
- Even a verified η > 0 for the a-case might be offset by an adversarial increase in b; the LP must optimize both simultaneously.

Closing
- Immediate action items: (1) Implement Q3 pattern classification and compute c_v biases for good Q3’s; (2) Draft the LP skeleton and test a symmetric relaxation (n large, per-vertex blue degree n/2) to probe whether b ≤ 1/2 − γ is plausible under local constraints.
