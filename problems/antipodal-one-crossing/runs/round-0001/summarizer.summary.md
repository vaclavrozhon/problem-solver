In this round, several claims were explored regarding the expander vs. sparse-cut dichotomy, Q3 density improvements, local surgery techniques, Fourier/junta stability, and refined random-geodesic coupling. Each claim presents potential benefits for reducing switches in biased blocks but lacks rigorous justification or empirical validation. Notably, the conductance claim requires a stronger connection to block size, while the Q3 density claim assumes uniformity without addressing specific colorings. Local surgery and Fourier/junta stability claims need more detailed combinatorial arguments and clearer connections to switch reduction. The refined random-geodesic coupling remains speculative and requires further empirical testing.
