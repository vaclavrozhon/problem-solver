Round summary: The round critically reviewed brainstormed approaches and fixed two key errors in task.tex: (1) the block-to-expansion sublemma is false as stated (explicit parity-coloring counterexample shows β_J = 1/2 for every block yet the monochromatic subgraph is disconnected), and (2) the Chernoff-style Case A bound is incorrect (expected off-color edges in a mildly biased block are ≈(1/2−ε)|J|, not O(ε|J|)). It was observed that raising p (fraction of good Q3’s) alone does not help because Dvořák’s formula depends on b (good–bad neighbor probability); to beat 3/8 one must force b ≤ 1/2−γ. A refined vertex-wise spectral MAX-CUT on KG(n,3) gives b_v ≤ 1/2 + 3/(2(n−3)), so vertex-only constraints cannot produce an absolute γ. Proposed concrete next moves: (A) enumerate Q3 colorings up to isomorphism and record the f1 "preferred color" at a marked vertex, (B) set up an LP/SDP over local 1/2/3-edge statistics with 4-cycle consistency and Dvořák badness filters to test whether local constraints force b ≤ 1/2−γ, and (C) formulate a corrected block-expansion lemma that includes endpoint-balance.
