  "feedback_md": "### Detailed feedback for the prover\n\n- **Understanding Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's Method**: The claim about Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's method is generally understood but lacks a rigorous proof or detailed analysis that confirms the effectiveness of 'good' $Q_3$ subcubes in reducing color changes. The toy counterexample provided is a good start but needs a more systematic exploration or simulation to validate the concern.\n\n- **Expander vs. Sparse-Cut Dichotomy**: The claim regarding the reduction of switches through biased blocks and defect clustering is interesting but lacks a formal proof or empirical evidence to support the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. The toy counterexample hints at potential issues but does not sufficiently challenge the claim's validity.\n\n- **$Q_3$ Density Improvement**: The claim about the potential for increasing the density of 'good' $Q_3$ subcubes is speculative without a clear method or proof to support it. The toy counterexample raises a valid concern, but the argument would benefit from a more detailed analysis or mathematical model to assess the feasibility of this approach.\n\n**Next Steps**: The proposed next steps are appropriate for further exploration. However, they would benefit from a more structured approach, including defining specific hypotheses to test, designing experiments or simulations to validate these hypotheses, and considering mathematical proofs where possible.",
