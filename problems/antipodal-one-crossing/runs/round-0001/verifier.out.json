  "feedback_md": "Overall, both reports are useful and largely on target, but there are a couple of concrete correctness issues in the counterexamples used to refute the \u201cblock-expansion\u201d brainstorm claim. I consolidate what is right, flag what is wrong, and propose next steps that build directly on the sound parts.\n\nWhat is solid and valuable:\n- The parameter focus is correct. In Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s framework, the expected switch bound is E[switches] \u2264 (1/3 + b/12 + o(1))\u00b7n; hence beating 3/8 requires proving b \u2264 1/2 \u2212 \u03b3 or reducing the 1/2 factor in the a-case. Merely increasing p does not help because p cancels via p = a + b/2.\n- The spectral Kneser-graph viewpoint (Prover 02) is rigorous and valuable. Modeling, for each vertex v, the set of \u201cgood\u201d triples as a cut in KG(n,3) immediately yields b_v \u2264 1/2 + 3/(2(n\u22123)), so b \u2264 1/2 + 3/(2(n\u22123)). This sharpens the o(1) term and cleanly isolates the remaining difficulty: vertex-wise information alone cannot push b below 1/2.\n- The critique of the \u201cCase A O(\u03b5|J|)\u201d bound is correct and important. If each direction in a block has blue-density 1/2+\u03b5, then a random geodesic crossing each direction once sees \u2248(1/2\u2212\u03b5)|J| minority edges on average, not O(\u03b5|J|). Any improvement must exploit additional structure (e.g., near-monochromatic directions, endpoint-balance, or expansion inside the block).\n- The LP/SDP plan to encode 4-cycle and local consistency constraints to drive b below 1/2 is promising and concrete. A computational relaxation can guide the analytic step.\n\nCorrections needed:\n- Prover 01\u2019s \u201cdisjoint A_i \u2282 {0,1}^{n\u22121} of size \u03b5\u00b72^{n\u22121}\u201d example does not achieve max degree \u2264 1 at vertices: pairwise disjointness of A_i in the projection space does not prevent a single vertex\u2019s different projections pi_i(x) from hitting different A_i. Moreover, for constant \u03b5 and large n, pairwise disjoint A_i of size \u03b5\u00b72^{n\u22121} cannot exist when n\u03b5 > 1.\n- Prover 02\u2019s parity example, as stated (\u201ccolor (x,x\u2295e_i) blue iff parity(x)=0\u201d), is not a well-defined 2-coloring of undirected edges; if corrected to \u201cparity outside i\u201d, the claim that all odd-parity vertices are isolated is false. A correct counterexample to the naive block-expansion claim is provided in the notes below.\n\nA corrected counterexample to the naive block-expansion claim (to store for future reference) is: fix a map j:[n]\u2192[n] with j(i)\u2260i for all i (e.g., j(1)=2 and j(i)=1 for i\u22652). For each i-edge {x, x\u2295e_i}, let y be the endpoint with y_i=0, and color this edge blue iff y_{j(i)}=1. Then for each i, exactly half of the i-edges are blue (so every block J has \u03b2_J=1/2), yet the blue subgraph has many isolated vertices (all vertices with x_1=0 and x_2=0 are isolated in the sample j above). Thus \u201cconstant fraction across each \u03b4S_J\u201d does not imply connectivity nor any conductance guarantee.\n\nActionable next steps:\n1) Implement the local LP/SDP relaxation for b: variables capturing frequencies of 1-edge colors at v, 4-cycle types at v, and Q3-pattern types (good/bad and the f1-chosen color at v). Impose marginal consistency and 4-cycle constraints. Maximize b subject to these constraints in the symmetric case deg_B(v)=n/2 to probe whether b \u2264 1/2 \u2212 \u03b3 holds.\n2) Good\u2013good boundary term: Enumerate good Q3 types up to isomorphism, fix a deterministic tie-break for f1, and compute the distribution of the preferred color at a marked vertex. Test if two independent disjoint good Q3\u2019s at v disagree with probability strictly below 1/2. If yes, quantify the resulting improvement in the a-term.\n3) If (1) yields a positive gap numerically, extract the extremal local statistics and attempt a combinatorial proof via 4-cycle consistency or \u201cno-tiling-by-bads\u201d negative-correlation lemmas.\n4) For the block-phase approach, formalize a corrected lemma that requires per-direction endpoint balance and a vertex-level minimum availability (\u2265\u03c1m majority-color edges) to deduce expansion/long runs, then prove it (e.g., via canonical paths or matrix Chernoff under adversarial dependencies).\n\nI have saved the rigorous spectral bound and the precise per-vertex star-count bound into output.md. The counterexample defeating naive block-expansion and the critique of the O(\u03b5|J|) claim are recorded in notes.md with a clean, checkable construction.",
  "new_notes_md": "Context and target in Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s framework\n- Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s modified-geodesic scheme yields the bound E[switches] \u2264 (1/3 + b/12 + o(1))\u00b7n, where b is the probability that two uniformly random neighboring Q3\u2019s (sharing exactly one vertex) have mixed types (one good, one bad). Because p cancels via p = a + b/2, any constant improvement over 3/8 must either prove b \u2264 1/2 \u2212 \u03b3 for some absolute \u03b3>0, or reduce the 1/2 bound in the a-term (both-good case).\n\nWhy naive block-density does not imply expansion (correct counterexample)\n- Brainstorm claim (now rejected): \u201cIf a color occupies at least an \u03b5-fraction of each block boundary \u03b4S_J for (1\u2212\u03b8) of the blocks, then that color has conductance \u03a9(\u03b5).\u201d This is false without further structure (e.g., endpoint balance and degree spread).\n- Construction (valid undirected 2-coloring): Fix j:[n]\u2192[n] such that j(i)\u2260i for all i. For each i-edge {x, x\u2295e_i}, let y be the endpoint with y_i=0 and color the edge blue iff y_{j(i)}=1; otherwise red. Then for each i, exactly half of the i-edges are blue (so \u03b2_J=1/2 for every block J). Yet the blue subgraph can be extremely sparse at many vertices; e.g., if j(1)=2 and j(i)=1 for all i\u22652, then for a vertex v, deg_B(v) = (n\u22121)\u00b7[v_1=1] + [v_2=1]. In particular, all vertices with (v_1,v_2)=(0,0) are isolated. Thus block-level edge-density alone does not imply connectivity, let alone conductance.\n- Separate but related flaw: Even if a block J has aggregate blue-density \u03b2_J = 1/2+\u03b5, one can realize this with each direction i\u2208J having density 1/2+\u03b5. A geodesic that uses each direction exactly once then sees \u2248(1/2\u2212\u03b5)|J| minority edges on average, not O(\u03b5|J|). Any O(\u03b5|J|) claim must extract stronger inner-block structure (e.g., many near-monochromatic directions).\n\nVertex-wise Kneser-graph formulation and spectral bound\n- For a fixed vertex v, Q3\u2019s through v correspond to 3-subsets of [n]. Two Q3\u2019s are v-neighbors iff their 3-sets are disjoint; this is the Kneser graph KG(n,3). If G_v\u2286C([n],3) is the set of \u201cgood\u201d triples at v, then b_v is the fraction of edges in KG(n,3) crossing the cut (G_v, its complement). The parameter b equals the average of b_v over v, up to negligible normalization.\n- Spectral MAX-CUT bound in KG(n,3): KG(n,3) is d-regular with d= C(n\u22123,3), and its least eigenvalue is \u2212C(n\u22124,2). Hence for any cut, the crossing-edge fraction is \u2264 1/2 \u2212 \u03bb_min/(2d) = 1/2 + 3/(2(n\u22123)). Therefore b \u2264 1/2 + 3/(2(n\u22123)). This recovers Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s b \u2264 1/2 + o(1) and makes the o(1) term explicit.\n\nPer-vertex monochromatic-star lower bound (useful bookkeeping)\n- For a vertex v with red degree r_v, the fraction of 3-subsets K such that the three edges at v in directions K are monochromatic equals [C(r_v,3) + C(n\u2212r_v,3)] / C(n,3). This is minimized near r_v\u2248n/2; explicitly: for n even it equals 2\u00b7C(n/2,3)/C(n,3), and for n odd it equals [C((n\u22121)/2,3)+C((n+1)/2,3)]/C(n,3). Asymptotically this is 1/4 \u2212 3/(4n) + O(1/n^2). This sharpened estimate alone cannot beat 3/8 but is a clean input for any refined accounting of the a-term.\n\nPromising directions to reduce b or the a-term\n- LP/SDP relaxation for b: Model local pattern frequencies around v (1-edge colors; 4-cycle types; Q3-types with the f1-chosen color), enforce marginal and 4-cycle consistency, and maximize b. Any universal optimum < 1/2 indicates a path to a combinatorial proof.\n- Good\u2013good boundary improvement: Enumerate good Q3 classes, fix canonical tie-breaking for f1, and measure the disagreement probability at v between two disjoint good Q3\u2019s. If it is \u2264 1/2 \u2212 \u03b7 for some \u03b7>0, the a-term improves by \u03b7.\n- Structural lemmas: Seek negative correlation between \u201cbadness\u201d indicators for disjoint triples at v, induced by 4-cycle constraints and the forbidden patterns of bad Q3\u2019s. Any quantified negative correlation lowers b below the vertexwise MAX-CUT upper bound.\n\nWhat to avoid or strengthen\n- Avoid relying on block-level densities without per-direction endpoint balance and degree-spread conditions. Any block-phase lemma should explicitly include such hypotheses (e.g., each direction in a good block has bias \u2265\u03b5 and each vertex has \u2265\u03c1\u00b7|J| majority-color incident edges within that block).",

Let Q_n be the n-dimensional hypercube with an arbitrary 2-coloring of its edges, and let b denote the probability that two uniformly random neighboring 3-cubes (Q3\u2019s) are of mixed type (one good, one bad) in the sense of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s construction. Then for all n \u2265 6,\n\nb \u2264 1/2 + 3/(2(n\u22123)).\n\nConsequently, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s expected switch bound refines to\nE[switches] \u2264 (1/3 + 1/24 + 1/(8(n\u22123)) + o(1))\u00b7n = (3/8 + 1/(8(n\u22123)) + o(1))\u00b7n.\n\nProof. Fix a vertex v of Q_n. Q3\u2019s through v correspond bijectively to 3-subsets K \u2286 [n] (the chosen directions), and two such Q3\u2019s are v-neighbors if and only if the 3-sets are disjoint. Thus, the v-neighborhood relation is the Kneser graph KG(n,3) on vertex-set C([n],3), which is d-regular with degree d = C(n\u22123,3). Let G_v \u2286 C([n],3) be the set of \u201cgood\u201d triples at v. The fraction b_v of v-neighbor pairs that are mixed equals the fraction of edges in KG(n,3) crossing the cut (G_v, C([n],3) \\ G_v). The global parameter b is the average of b_v over all v (this is a direct consequence of the definition of \u201cneighboring Q3\u2019s\u201d as sharing exactly one vertex; each ordered choice of the shared vertex v and a disjoint pair of triples contributes equally).\n\nFor any d-regular graph with adjacency matrix A and least eigenvalue \u03bb_min, the size of any cut is at most |E|\u00b7(1/2 \u2212 \u03bb_min/(2d)). This follows from the identity that, for a \u00b11 vector s indicating a cut, the number of crossing edges equals |E|/2 \u2212 (1/4) s^T A s, combined with s^T A s \u2265 \u03bb_min \u00b7 s^T s = \u03bb_min \u00b7 |V| and |E| = d|V|/2. The Kneser graph KG(n,3) has spectrum { C(n\u22123,3), \u2212C(n\u22124,2), n\u22125, \u22121 } (standard; see e.g. Lov\u00e1sz, 1979), so \u03bb_min = \u2212C(n\u22124,2). Hence every cut in KG(n,3) has crossing-edge fraction at most 1/2 \u2212 (\u2212C(n\u22124,2))/(2 C(n\u22123,3)) = 1/2 + C(n\u22124,2)/(2 C(n\u22123,3)) = 1/2 + 3/(2(n\u22123)). Therefore b_v \u2264 1/2 + 3/(2(n\u22123)) for each v, and averaging gives the same bound for b. The stated corollary for E[switches] follows by substitution into Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s expression. \u220e\n\nLemma B (Per-vertex lower bound on monochromatic-star triples)\nStatement. Let v be a vertex of Q_n and let r_v be the number of red edges incident to v (so n \u2212 r_v are blue). The fraction of 3-sets K \u2286 [n] such that the three edges at v with directions K are monochromatic equals\n\n\u03c4_v = [ C(r_v,3) + C(n \u2212 r_v,3) ] / C(n,3).\n\nIn particular, \u03c4_v is minimized when r_v \u2208 {\u230an/2\u230b, \u2308n/2\u2309}. For n even, the minimum equals 2\u00b7C(n/2,3)/C(n,3); for n odd, it equals [C((n\u22121)/2,3) + C((n+1)/2,3)]/C(n,3). As n\u2192\u221e, uniformly in v,\n\t\u03c4_v \u2265 1/4 \u2212 3/(4n) + O(1/n^2).\n\nProof. Among all 3-sets K, exactly C(r_v,3) of them consist of three red directions at v, and exactly C(n \u2212 r_v,3) consist of three blue directions at v. There are C(n,3) total 3-sets, so the fraction is \u03c4_v as stated. Define g(r) = C(r,3) + C(n \u2212 r,3) for integer r. Then g(r+1) \u2212 g(r) = C(r,2) \u2212 C(n \u2212 r \u2212 1,2), which is negative for r < (n\u22121)/2 and positive for r > (n\u22121)/2; hence g is minimized at r \u2208 {\u230an/2\u230b, \u2308n/2\u2309}. Substituting these values yields the explicit minima. The asymptotic expansion follows by a routine Taylor expansion of the ratio of polynomials in n. \u220e",
