--- SYSTEM ---
You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md and output.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers
- notes.md (summary so far)
- output.md (rigorously proven results so far)

Guidelines:
- notes.md: should be a readable running log of interesting work. Prefer appending. Replace only if old notes are clearly misleading. Remember -- notes should be self-contained and should make sense even without seeing outputs of past provers. 
- output.md: should be concise and rigorous. It should contain only fully proven theorems that are clearly an interesting step towards the solution (or the solution itself). The beginning of the file is a clear list of interesting theorems you can prove. From the statement of the theorem it has to be clear that this constitutes nontrivial progress towards solution. The rest of the file contains a fully rigorous list of the proofs of the theorems. Keep only proven theorems with clear proofs. If a statement is flawed and you cannot fix it, remove it from output.md and instead add it to notes.md with explanation.
- Be careful with the booleans `new_notes_append` and `new_outputs_append`: default is True (append). Use False only when deliberately rewriting everything.

Tasks:
1) Audit rigor: identify unjustified steps, false statements, missing lemmas; produce minimal counterexamples.
2) Triage value: separate genuine progress from noise.
3) Guide next steps: propose what provers should try next.

[{"prover_id": "01", "progress_md": "Status and reading\n- I did not receive output.md or notes.md in this round; I cannot audit curated results. I focus on the task.tex and Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s paper (EJC 2020) to make incremental, checkable progress.\n\nRecap of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s parameterization\n- The modified-geodesic scheme partitions a random antipodal geodesic into Q3-blocks and uses a local map f to rewire inside each block. The expected number of switches becomes\n  E[switches] \u2264 (1/3 + b/12 + o(1)) n,\n  where b is the probability that two uniformly random neighboring Q3\u2019s (sharing exactly one vertex) are of mixed type (one good, one bad). Dvo\u0159\u00e1k proved b \u2264 1/2 + o(1), giving (3/8 + o(1))n. Any constant improvement must force b \u2264 1/2 \u2212 \u03b3 for some absolute \u03b3 > 0 (unless one redesigns the scheme at a larger scale).\n\nGap in brainstorming item 1 (block-expander dichotomy)\n- Claim in task.tex: \u201cIf a color occupies at least an \u03b5-fraction of each \u03b4S_J for (1\u2212\u03b8) of the blocks, then that color has conductance \u2126(\u03b5).\u201d This is false in general.\n- Counterexample (fully explicit; checkable): Fix n and \u03b5 \u2208 (0,1/2). For each direction i \u2208 [n], choose a pairwise-disjoint set A_i \u2282 {0,1}^{n\u22121} of size \u03b5\u00b72^{n\u22121}. Color an edge (x, x \u2295 e_i) blue iff the projection of x onto coordinates [n]\\{i} lies in A_i; otherwise color it red. Then for every block J, the blue fraction across \u03b4S_J (the union of directions i \u2208 J) is exactly \u03b5, so the premise holds with \u03b8 = 0. However, the blue subgraph is a disjoint union of matchings (every vertex is incident to at most one blue edge because the A_i are disjoint), hence it has zero conductance. Therefore the \u201cdeliverable sublemma\u201d is invalid without additional pseudorandomness or degree-spread assumptions.\n- Consequence: The \u201cCase A\u201d estimate \u201cO(\u03b5|J|) off-color edges per biased block\u201d also lacks justification. Even if \u03b2_J = 1/2 + \u03b5 at the block scale, one can realize this with each direction i having exactly 1/2 + \u03b5 fraction blue; then any geodesic that flips each i once sees \u2248 (1/2 \u2212 \u03b5)m minority edges on average, not O(\u03b5m). Without extra structure (e.g., many near-monochromatic directions within the block), the proposed O(\u03b5m) bound is not achievable.\n\nCorrected formulation (what would be sufficient)\n- A plausible, fixable version would require both:\n  (i) per-direction bias within \u201cgood\u201d blocks: for at least (1\u2212\u03b8) blocks J, each direction i \u2208 J has blue fraction in [1/2 + \u03b5, 1] or [0, 1/2 \u2212 \u03b5]; and\n  (ii) vertex-level spread: every vertex is incident to at least \u03c1m blue edges from these directions for some fixed \u03c1 > 0 (ruling out disjoint concentration as in the counterexample).\n- Under (i)+(ii), a matrix-Chernoff/random-walk argument on the sum of many (partially) present matchings could give a conductance lower bound \u03a6 = \u2126(\u03b5\u03c1), yielding a long monochromatic burst and fewer switches. This is a new sublemma to be proven; current task: formalize an expander bound from degree and per-matching density lower bounds under adversarial placement (nontrivial because independence is absent). One candidate route: canonical paths that use, for each coordinate, the present-blue matching with probability \u2265 \u03b5 and exploit that each vertex has \u2265 \u03c1m available blue directions.\n\nTowards reducing b below 1/2\n- Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s bound b \u2264 1/2 + o(1) was obtained by, for each vertex v, letting s(v) be the number of good Q3\u2019s containing v and observing that the fraction of good\u2013bad v-neighbor pairs is at most s(v)(k\u2212s(v)) with k = C(n,3), maximized at s(v)=k/2. To beat 1/2 one needs extra constraints coupling the types of different triples through shared edges/4-cycles.\n- Key observation: The dependence of type(T) on the coloring enforces monotone constraints beyond \u201cmonochromatic star \u21d2 good.\u201d For a fixed v, the type function T_v on 3-subsets of [n] is not arbitrary; it must satisfy many local consistency relations (e.g., coming from the bad-Q3 structure Lemma 9 and from overlaps with other vertices of the same Q3). Exploiting these should lower the extremal good\u2013bad mixing below the naive s(k\u2212s) bound.\n\nAuditable plan: a local LP/SDP bound for b\n- Variables: For a fixed vertex v, let p_{abc} be the frequency over 3-sets I \u2282 [n] of the color-pattern at v on the three incident edges in directions I, where a,b,c \u2208 {R,B} in some canonical order. Enforce the exact marginals determined by the degree at v: P(3R)=C(r_v,3)/C(n,3), P(3B)=C(n\u2212r_v,3)/C(n,3), and the sums over 2R1B, 1R2B follow combinatorially.\n- Enrich with 4-cycle constraints: For any pair of directions i\u2260j, and a third k, the joint distributions across the two Q3\u2019s with triples {i,j,k} and {i,j,k\u2032} must be compatible with the coloring on the 4-cycle generated by i and j. This couples p-distributions for different k,k\u2032.\n- Add \u201cbadness filters\u201d from Lemma 9: for a bad Q3, from each vertex v there must exist exactly-one-change antipodal geodesics with prescribed colors at v and v\u2032. Encode this as linear constraints on the frequencies with which a 3-set is classified as bad given its edge-colors at all 8 vertices (the latter determined by the global edge-coloring restricted to the Q3).\n- Objective: Maximize the expected proportion of good\u2013bad neighbor pairs b_v at v over all feasible distributions; then average v. Any universal upper bound strictly below 1/2 gives the desired \u03b3. This is implementable as a relaxation (LP or small SDP) on the local configuration space (dimension controlled by the number of edge-color patterns on Q3 up to symmetry). Deliverable: set up the constraint system and solve numerically to detect a gap \u03b3 > 0, then try to certify analytically a positive margin.\n\nSmall, checkable computations that feed the LP\n- Per-vertex lower bound on good Q3\u2019s: For r_v red degree at v, the fraction of 3-sets yielding a monochromatic star is\n  \u03c4_v = [C(r_v,3)+C(n\u2212r_v,3)] / C(n,3) = x^3+(1\u2212x)^3 + O(1/n), with x=r_v/n.\n  Minimizing in x gives \u03c4_v \u2265 1/4 \u2212 3/(4n) + O(1/n^2). This refines Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s \u201c\u2265 1/4 \u2212 o(1)\u201d and quantifies the o(1) term; it feeds into the good\u2013good boundary switch bound but, by itself, cannot beat 1/2.\n\nConditional improvement via vertex-bias (a structural lemma)\n- Define, for a good Q3 containing v, the \u201csuggested color at v,\u201d \u03c3 \u2208 {R,B}, as the color of the first edge in (v, f(v,w)). For v with red-degree fraction x, the bias among the good triples that are monochromatic at v is proportional to x^3\u2212(1\u2212x)^3 = (2x\u22121)(1/2\u2212x(1\u2212x)). Thus, if a positive fraction of vertices have |2x\u22121| \u2265 \u03b7, then among good\u2013good neighbor pairs at those v the disagreement probability drops below 1/2 by a quantity \u2126(\u03b7), improving the boundary contribution. This yields a conditional bound of the form\n  E[switches] \u2264 (3/8 \u2212 c\u00b7E_v[|2r_v/n \u2212 1|]) n + o(n).\n  This is checkable once one quantifies how often f(v,w) is driven by the monochromatic-star mechanism among good Q3\u2019s. The obstruction: there exist colorings with r_v\u2261n/2 (balanced at every vertex), so unconditional gains cannot rely on vertex-star bias alone.\n\nToy counterexamples and sanity tests\n- The \u201cdisjoint A_i\u201d construction shows block-level density guarantees do not imply expansion or easy phase clustering. It also shows that any argument requiring O(\u03b5m) minority edges per block must use stronger per-direction or per-vertex assumptions.\n- Balanced-at-every-vertex constructions (deg_R(v) \u2261 n/2) plausibly exist; in such colorings, per-vertex label biases vanish, so good\u2013good boundary disagreement can be \u2248 1/2. Any unconditional improvement must therefore act through inter-triple consistency constraints (the proposed LP/SDP plan).\n\nNext steps (actionable)\n1) Formalize and solve the local LP: enumerate Q3 edge-colorings up to isomorphism; identify \u201cgood\u201d vs \u201cbad\u201d as in Dvo\u0159\u00e1k; introduce variables for frequencies of these patterns across the hypercube under the restriction that pairs sharing a vertex are coupled by 4-cycles. Compute the maximal b over feasible distributions. Even a numerical \u03b3 \u2248 10^{-3} would guide the analytic step.\n2) Prove a strengthened \u201cno-tiling-by-bads\u201d lemma: show that for any fixed vertex v, among the 3-sets I disjoint from a fixed 3-set J, the indicator that Q3(v,I) is bad cannot be independent of Q3(v,J) being bad; quantify a negative correlation. This would directly lower b.\n3) Explore Q4-block variant: Define \u201cgood Q4\u201d and a corresponding f with improved boundary synchronization, aiming to replace the b/12 term by (b\u2032/12) with b\u2032 < b. Start with computational exploration on Q4 patterns.\n4) Salvage block-phase under strengthened hypotheses: formulate and prove a lemma that if in at least (1\u2212\u03b8) blocks each direction has per-direction bias \u2265 \u03b5 and each vertex sees \u2265 \u03c1m majority-color edges within those blocks, then one phase yields O((1/m)+\u03b8+(1\u2212\u03b8)(1\u2212\u03b5\u03c1)) n switches. This will be a stand-alone result useful in a hybrid approach.\n\nSummary of progress this round\n- Identified and rigorously refuted a key sublemma in the brainstorm (expansion from block-thick density), with an explicit counterexample that also invalidates the O(\u03b5m) minority-edge claim.\n- Clarified that improving the (3/8) constant within Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s framework hinges on proving b \u2264 1/2 \u2212 \u03b3 and proposed a concrete, auditable LP/SDP program to capture necessary local constraints beyond the vertex-star bound.\n- Provided refined per-vertex counting bounds and a conditional structural lemma showing how vertex bias would reduce boundary disagreement (useful in structural case analyses).\n- Outlined concrete next steps (computational and analytic) to move toward a constant \u03b3 > 0.\n"}, {"prover_id": "02", "progress_md": "Round 0001 \u2014 Critical review of brainstormed approaches; precise counterexamples; small rigorized lemmas and a concrete plan to target the parameter b in Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s scheme\n\nSummary of materials read\n- task.tex: Problem and brainstormed approaches (1\u20136).\n- Dvo\u0159\u00e1k (2020) paper (ejc 27(2) #P2.26): Proof of the (3/8+o(1))n bound via Q3-patching; definitions of good/bad Q3, parameters p,a,b, and the resulting bound (1/3 + b/12 + o(1))n.\n- There is no output.md provided; nothing to curate yet.\n\nGaps and corrections to notes in task.tex\n1) \u201cDeliverable sublemma\u201d under approach 1 is false as stated.\n- Claim in notes: If a color occupies at least an \u03b5-fraction of each block boundary \u03b4S_J for (1\u2212\u03b8) of the blocks, then that color has conductance \u03a9(\u03b5) in the whole cube (hence a monochromatic antipodal path).\n- Counterexample (explicit): Color every edge (x,x\u2295e_i) blue iff the Hamming parity of x is 0, and red otherwise. Then in every direction i and every block J we have exactly half of the edges blue, i.e. \u03b2_J = 1/2 for all J. Yet the blue subgraph has all odd-parity vertices isolated (degree 0), hence conductance 0 and is disconnected. Therefore, occupying a constant fraction of each \u03b4S_J does not imply any expansion or even connectivity. The obstruction is concentration on one bipartition side per direction.\n- Conclusion: Any usable block-to-expansion lemma must include a \u201cbalanced across endpoints\u201d condition (e.g. per-direction, blue edges incident to each bipartition side in the block must form a constant fraction), not just an aggregate fraction across \u03b4S_J.\n\n2) Case A \u201cChernoff\u201d bound in approach 1 is not valid as written.\n- Notes say: In a biased block J with \u03b2_J \u2209 [1/2\u2212\u03b5, 1/2+\u03b5], a random start and random ordering yields O(\u03b5|J|) off-color edges, then 4-cycle commuting clusters defects and total switches \u2264 T + O(\u03b5 n).\n- Issue: For a uniformly random start x and random ordering of the |J| directions, the i-edge encountered is uniformly distributed among all i-edges, so the expected number of blue edges encountered equals \u03b2_J|J| and red equals (1\u2212\u03b2_J)|J|. If blue is the \u201cmajority,\u201d the expected off-color count is (1\u2212\u03b2_J)|J|, which is \u2248 (1/2\u2212\u03b5)|J| when \u03b2_J = 1/2+\u03b5 \u2014 not O(\u03b5|J|). Concentration inequalities do not apply directly here because these are m dependent edge-indicators evaluated at the same random vertex x.\n- Even existence via the method of conditional expectation only guarantees there is an order achieving at most the expectation (\u2248 (1/2\u2212\u03b5)|J| off-color edges in the mild-bias regime), not O(\u03b5|J|). So the proposed inequality is overly optimistic.\n\n3) Why a naive \u201cp-density of good Q3\u2019s\u201d cannot improve 3/8 by itself.\n- In Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s analysis, after defining p (fraction of good Q3), a (probability two random neighboring Q3 are both good), and b (probability one good, one bad), the final expected bound simplifies to (1/3 + b/12 + o(1))n using p = a + b/2. Thus p cancels out. Any plan focusing only on raising p above 1/2 (approach 2 as currently phrased) does not directly improve the constant; one must lower b strictly below 1/2 (or reduce the \u201ca-case\u201d boundary change probability below 1/2).\n\nSmall rigorized lemmas and bounds\nA) Vertex-wise Kneser (disjointness) graph viewpoint and a clean upper bound on mixed pairs.\n- Setup: For a fixed vertex v, Q3-subcubes through v correspond to 3-subsets K \u2282 [n] (directions). Two such Q3\u2019s are v-neighbors iff K1 \u2229 K2 = \u2205. This is the Kneser graph KG(n,3) on vertices V = {K \u2282 [n]: |K|=3}, edges between disjoint triples. Let N = |V| = C(n,3), degree d = C(n\u22123,3).\n- For a given coloring, let G_v \u2286 V be the set of good triples at v; then b_v is the fraction of edges in KG(n,3) that cross the cut (G_v, V\\G_v). Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s \u201cb\u201d is the average over vertices of b_v, up to the normalization between ordered/unordered pairs (which cancels in fractions).\n- Spectral MAX-CUT bound (standard): For any d-regular graph with smallest eigenvalue \u03bb_min, the maximum cut has at most |E|\u00b7(1/2)(1\u2212\u03bb_min/d) edges. For KG(n,3), the spectrum is known: eigenvalues are \u03bb_0 = d, \u03bb_1 = \u2212C(n\u22124,2), \u03bb_2 = n\u22125, \u03bb_3 = \u22121. Hence \u03bb_min = \u2212C(n\u22124,2).\n- Therefore, for every v and every choice of G_v,\n  b_v \u2264 1/2 \u00b7 (1 \u2212 \u03bb_min/d) = 1/2 \u00b7 (1 + C(n\u22124,2)/C(n\u22123,3)).\n  Since C(n\u22124,2)/C(n\u22123,3) = 3/(n\u22123),\n  b_v \u2264 1/2 + 3/(2(n\u22123)).\n- Averaging over v gives the same bound for b up to o(1/n) bookkeeping. This recovers and slightly sharpens Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s b \u2264 1/2 + o(1), giving an explicit o(1) term. It also clarifies the structural limitation: vertex-wise information alone cannot force b \u2264 1/2\u2212\u03b3 for absolute \u03b3.\n- Usefulness here: This pins down what extra (non-vertexwise) structure must be exploited to beat 3/8: correlations among the labels G_v across different vertices/edges, not captured by per-vertex cuts, are necessary.\n\nB) Formal \u201cno-go\u201d lemma for naive block-conductance.\n- Statement: There exist 2-colorings for which, for every block partition {J_t}, every block J satisfies \u03b2_J = 1/2 (blue occupies half of \u03b4S_J), yet the blue subgraph is disconnected (indeed, has 2^{n\u22121} isolated vertices) and has conductance 0.\n- Proof: The parity coloring described above has b_i(x) = 1 iff \u27e8x,1^n\u27e9 mod 2 = 0 for every direction i. Then exactly half of i-edges are blue for every i, whence \u03b2_J = 1/2 for all J. But odd-parity vertices have zero blue degree, so the blue subgraph is disconnected. QED.\n- Usefulness here: Clarifies that any block-expansion lemma must additionally control endpoint-balance per direction (or within-block bipartition balance), not just overall fractions.\n\nRefined ideas targeting the boundary term (the parameter b)\nIdea I: Replace the per-vertex trivial cut bound with constraints across vertices via 4-cycle consistency.\n- Observation: The good/bad status of Q3(v,K) depends on the colors of edges both through v and away from v. Two disjoint triples K1,K2 at v involve disjoint sets of directions; hence many 4-cycles and 3-faces touching v and those directions mediate dependencies between \u201cgood at K1\u201d and \u201cgood at K2\u201d. The per-vertex MAX-CUT bound treats G_v as an arbitrary subset of triples, ignoring these constraints.\n- Plan (LP/SDP framework): Introduce variables for frequencies of local patterns around v on:\n  \u2022 1-edge statistics at v: the color of each direction i.\n  \u2022 2-edge statistics at v: for unordered pairs {i,j}, the multiset of colors on the 4-cycle through v in directions i,j (there are only a few 2-color isomorphism types), capturing parity constraints.\n  \u2022 3-edge statistics: the 2-coloring type of Q3(v,K), with a flag good/bad and, for good, the color at v chosen by f1.\n- Impose consistency constraints: marginalization (3-edge types project to 2-edge and 1-edge types), and that for each fixed {i,j}, all four Q3 containing {i,j} at v aggregate consistently with the 4-cycle type. Also enforce that across a uniformly random direction set, distributions are invariant. Finally, encode that pairs (K1,K2) disjoint at v induce the boundary change indicator using the chosen colors for f1.\n- Objective: Maximize b (probability of good-bad among disjoint pairs) plus the \u201cboth-good boundary switch\u201d probability, to reproduce Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s boundary analysis with the extra structural constraints. The hope: these constraints force b strictly below 1/2.\n- Auditable next step: Enumerate the finite type spaces explicitly (number of 2-edge types at v is small; number of Q3 types up to automorphism is also small), write the linear constraints, and solve the LP numerically to obtain a candidate \u03b3 > 0. If obtained, this gives a concrete target to then re-prove combinatorially.\n\nIdea II: Classify Q3 patterns more finely to reduce the \u201ca-case\u201d bound below 1/2.\n- In Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s proof, when both neighboring Q3\u2019s are good (probability a), the probability of a boundary color switch at the common vertex is bounded by 1/2 + o(1). This is where structural savings may be hidden: for good Q3\u2019s, the choice of f1 is not arbitrary; it tends to align with the majority color at the shared vertex in that Q3 (anchoring at a monochromatic star when present, see Lemma 8). Disjoint good cubes\u2019 preferences may align more than random, leading to \u2264 1/2 \u2212 \u03b7 for some absolute \u03b7.\n- Concrete step: Enumerate good Q3 isomorphism classes; for each class and a marked vertex, compute c_v (the color at v chosen by f1 in that Q3). Show that for two independent disjoint good cubes, P[c_v differ] \u2264 1/2 \u2212 \u03b7. Then the \u201ca-term\u201d contribution in Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s bound becomes (1/2 \u2212 \u03b7 + o(1)) a, improving the constant.\n- Why plausible: The anchored-good subclass (Lemma 8) contributes a positive mass where c_v equals the common color at v; when degrees at v are slightly imbalanced these dominate. Even in the balanced case, the structure of bad patterns (Lemma 9) implies that good patterns have a constrained \u201cpreferred color\u201d at v. This can be tested computationally for Q3.\n\nModest but checkable auxiliary computations\n- Re-derive the exact coefficient that Dvo\u0159\u00e1k bounds in the \u201ca-case.\u201d In the paper (p. 5\u20136), the 1/2 + o(1) arises by a crude bound treating pairs of good v-neighbors that share another vertex as negligible. A tighter local counting (still within good Q3\u2019s) may already give a c/n improvement in the \u201ca-term.\u201d While asymptotically negligible for our target, it will validate the direction and help calibrate the LP in Idea I.\n\nExamples to stress-test claims\n- Parity coloring (defined above):\n  \u2022 All blocks have \u03b2_J = 1/2; the blue subgraph is disconnected: demonstrates failure of naive conductance claims.\n  \u2022 Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s scheme applied here: almost surely a monochromatic antipodal path exists when n is even (choose blue if start and end in even parity class), but not necessarily via geodesics; confirms that the method\u2019s lower-level constants must be disentangled from global connectivity phenomena.\n\nNext steps (concrete, auditable)\n1) Q3 pattern enumeration and \u201cpreferred color map\u201d at a vertex.\n- Task: List all 2-colorings of Q3 up to automorphism, mark the isomorphism classes that are good/bad (using Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s definition), and for each good class and marked vertex identify the color at the marked vertex selected by f1 (minimal changes; fix a deterministic tie-break). Output: a table of classes with weights.\n- Deliverable: For two independent random good Q3\u2019s at v with disjoint direction sets (approximating independence), compute the probability their f1-colors at v differ. If this is \u2264 1/2 \u2212 \u03b7 for some \u03b7 > 0, draft a lemma capturing this bias. If not, record the counterexample pattern mix.\n\n2) LP bound for b using local consistency.\n- Task: Set up a linear program over the frequencies of: (i) per-vertex degree of blue; (ii) per-pair 4-cycle type frequencies at v; (iii) Q3 pattern frequencies at v. Impose marginal constraints and consistency of pairs of disjoint triples at v. Maximize b subject to these constraints to test if b \u2264 1/2 \u2212 \u03b3 is forced by local structure. Start with a reduced symmetry model (assume per-vertex blue degree equals n/2) to simplify.\n\n3) Repair of approach 1 (block phase) via endpoint-balance conditions.\n- Task: Formulate and prove a corrected lemma: If in a block J and for each direction i \u2208 J the set {x \u2208 {0,1}^n : the i-edge at x is blue} has density in [\u03b5, 1\u2212\u03b5] and additionally its correlation with the block-parity function p_J is at most 1\u22122\u03b5, then the blue subgraph restricted to coordinates in J is connected within each coset of the other coordinates. Sketch a proof via expansion of a product of matchings with endpoint balance, or point out the precise obstacle.\n- Usefulness: Even if this does not directly lead to a global \u03b4, it will clarify what endpoint-balance one must enforce to get monochromatic long runs.\n\n4) Document the exact dependence on b in Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s bound and isolate where boundary improvements can be inserted.\n- Task: Rewrite the final inequality as switches \u2264 (1/3 + b/12 + \u03c6)a + \u03c8 with explicit \u03c6,\u03c8 capturing the \u201ca-case\u201d boundary term. Identify the component where replacing 1/2 by 1/2 \u2212 \u03b7 moves the final constant by \u03b7\u00b7(a/3). This will quantify how large an \u03b7 is needed for a given lower bound on a.\n\nWhy these steps are promising\n- They target the only parameter that matters in Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s calculation (b), or the only loose bound (the 1/2 in the a-case), and they incorporate cross-cube constraints (4-cycles and consistency) that weren\u2019t used in the 3/8 bound. Either an LP certifies a strict gap or it produces extremal local statistics guiding a human proof.\n\nPotential obstacles\n- Independence assumptions between disjoint triples at v are false; the LP must encode enough consistency without exploding in size. Start with a relaxation.\n- Ties in the f1 choice for good Q3\u2019s must be resolved canonically to keep the model deterministic; otherwise adversarial tie-breaking could push probabilities toward 1/2.\n- Even a verified \u03b7 > 0 for the a-case might be offset by an adversarial increase in b; the LP must optimize both simultaneously.\n\nClosing\n- Immediate action items: (1) Implement Q3 pattern classification and compute c_v biases for good Q3\u2019s; (2) Draft the LP skeleton and test a symmetric relaxation (n large, per-vertex blue degree n/2) to probe whether b \u2264 1/2 \u2212 \u03b3 is plausible under local constraints.\n"}]
