• Claims present interesting approaches but lack rigorous justification.
• Conductance claim needs a stronger connection to block size.
• Q3 density claim assumes uniformity without addressing specific colorings.
• Local surgery claim requires detailed combinatorial arguments.
• Fourier/junta stability needs clearer connections to switch reduction.
• Refined random-geodesic coupling is speculative and needs empirical validation.
