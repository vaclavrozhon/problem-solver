A small bookkeeping remark: the identity “global b is the average of b_v over v” uses that the number of v-neighbor pairs is ½·C(n,3)·C(n−3,3), independent of v.\\n- Note that substituting this bound into Dvořák’s formula yields E[switches] ≤ (3/8 + 1/(8(n−3)) + o(1))·n, which is a slightly weaker upper bound than 3/8 + o(1) (the +1/(8(n−3)) is positive). This is not an improvement, but it cleanly quantifies the o(1) term achievable from per-vertex information alone.\\n- Lemma B (monochromatic-star count) is correct. It will be a useful input to quantify biases at vertices.\\n\\n## New idea: quantify both-good boundary savings via a per-vertex bias parameter\\nWe isolate the exact contribution of “both-good” v-neighbor pairs, improving Dvořák’s generic 1/2 bound by a vertex-level bias term that can later be lower-bounded in structural cases.\\n\\nDefinition (preferred color distribution at v among good Q3). For a vertex v, for each good Q3(v,K) and the map f1 used inside that Q3, define c_v(K) ∈ {R,B} as the color of the first edge at v along (v, f1(v,w)). Let t_v be the number of good Q3 containing v and let\\n\\\\[ p_v := \\\\mathbb{P}_{K\\\\mid v,\\\\,\\\\text{good}}\\\\big[c_v(K)=\\\\R\\\\big] = r_v^{(g)}/t_v,\\\\quad u_v := |2p_v−1|. \\\\]\\nHere r_v^{(g)} counts K with c_v(K)=R. By Lemma 8 and the definition of f1, c_v(K) is well defined (ties are broken deterministically within f1).\\n\\nLemma (both-good boundary disagreement at v). Among pairs of good v-neighbor Q3’s (disjoint triples) chosen uniformly, the probability that their f1-preferred colors at v differ is\\n\\\\[ \\\\le \\\\frac{1}{2} - \\\\frac{u_v^2}{2} + O\\\\!\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\right). \\\\]\\nSketch. If we sampled two good triples uniformly without replacement from the t_v good triples, the exact fraction of disagreeing unordered pairs would be r_v^{(g)}(t_v−r_v^{(g)})/\\\\binom{t_v}{2} = \\\\frac{t_v}{t_v−1}\\\\cdot 2p_v(1−p_v) = \\\\frac{t_v}{t_v−1}\\\\cdot\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2} − \\\\frac{u_v^2}{2}\\\\right). Restricting to v-neighbors excludes pairs that share a direction; for each fixed good Q3 there are at most O(n^2) “forbidden” partners (share ≥1 extra direction), so among \\\\Theta(n^3) good triples this exclusion perturbs the pair distribution by O(1/n). Hence the bound follows.\\n\\nCorollary (refined a-term). Writing a for the probability that two random neighboring Q3’s (sharing one vertex) are both good, the boundary-change probability in the both-good case satisfies\\n\\\\[ \\\\mathbb{P}[\\\\text{boundary switch}\\\\mid \\\\text{both good}] \\\\le \\\\frac{1}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\,\\\\mathbb{E}_v[u_v^2] + O\\\\!\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\right). \\\\]\\nConsequently, Dvořák’s expected-switch bound improves to\\n\\\\[ \\\\mathbb{E}[\\\\text{switches}] \\\\le \\\\Big( \\\\tfrac{1}{3} + \\\\tfrac{b}{12} + \\\\tfrac{a}{3}\\\\big( \\\\tfrac{1}{2} - \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\,\\\\mathbb{E}_v[u_v^2] + O(\\\\tfrac{1}{n})\\\\big) + o(1) \\\\Big) n \\n= \\\\Big( \\\\tfrac{1}{3} + \\\\tfrac{b}{12} + \\\\tfrac{a}{6} - \\\\tfrac{a}{6}\\\\,\\\\mathbb{E}_v[u_v^2] + o(1) \\\\Big) n. \\\\]\\nThis cleanly isolates a quantitative source of savings: any universal lower bound on \\\\(\\\\mathbb{E}_v[u_v^2]\\\\) yields a constant improvement over 3/8.\\n\\nWhy useful here. This replaces the crude 1/2 in the a-term by 1/2 − (1/2)·E_v[u_v^2] + o(1). It is fully compatible with Dvořák’s framework and reduces the problem to exhibiting a nontrivial global bias among preferred colors at vertices, or to a dichotomy: either E_v[u_v^2] is bounded away from zero (immediate gain) or a “near-balanced” structure holds that we can try to exploit to force b ≤ 1/2 − γ.\\n\\n## A conditional special case: degree-biased colorings force savings\\nLink u_v to the edge-color degree imbalance at v using star-good triples.\\n- Let x_v := r_v/n be the red-degree fraction at v. Among good triples, at least the monochromatic-star triples contribute, and for those c_v(K) equals the star color at v. Thus\\n  \\\\[ p_v \\\\ge \\\\frac{\\\\binom{r_v}{3}}{t_v},\\\\quad 1-p_v \\\\ge \\\\frac{\\\\binom{n-r_v}{3}}{t_v},\\\\quad t_v \\\\ge \\\\binom{r_v}{3}+\\\\binom{n-r_v}{3}. \\\\]\\n- Hence \\\\(u_v \\\\ge \\\\dfrac{\\\\big|\\\\binom{r_v}{3} - \\\\binom{n-r_v}{3}\\\\big|}{\\\\binom{r_v}{3}+\\\\binom{n-r_v}{3}}\\\\). For x_v = 1/2 + \\\\eta with |\\\\eta| ≪ 1, a Taylor expansion gives \\\\(u_v \\\\gtrsim 6|\\\\eta| + O(\\\\eta^3)\\\\).\\n- Therefore, if a positive fraction \\\\(\\\\rho\\\\) of vertices satisfy |x_v − 1/2| ≥ \\\\eta₀, then \\\\(\\\\mathbb{E}_v[u_v^2] \\\\ge c\\\\,\\\\rho\\\\,\\\\eta_0^2\\\\) for some absolute c > 0. Plugging into the corollary gives a concrete improvement \\\\(\\\\delta \\\\ge c'\\\\,a\\\\,\\\\rho\\\\,\\\\eta_0^2\\\\).\\nThis yields an auditable gain in the “degree-biased” regime. The hard case is the “globally balanced” regime where x_v ≈ 1/2 for most v.\\n\\n## Obstacles and where the improvement must come from in the balanced regime\\n- There may exist colorings with x_v ≈ 1/2 for all (or almost all) vertices, killing the above degree-based bias. In this regime, any gain must come from structural constraints coupling the c_v(K) labels across different K (4-cycle/face consistency) and from the interaction between good and bad Q3’s (parameter b).\\n- The spectral KG(n,3) bound shows that cuts G_v⊂C([n],3) alone do not force b < 1/2. We must exploit cross-vertex and cross-triple constraints inherently present in the cube that the Kneser abstraction discards.\\n\\n## Concrete, checkable next steps\\n1) Formalize and add the “both-good refinement” lemma to output.md. It is self-contained and only uses counting over t_v and the O(n^2)-exclusion argument already present implicitly in Dvořák’s proof. This yields a parameterized improvement term −(a/6)·E_v[u_v^2]·n.\\n2) Quantify the degree-bias case: write a short lemma proving u_v ≥ c·|2x_v−1| for star-driven minima (as above), with explicit c from exact binomial ratios, and derive the resulting δ in terms of the density of vertices with |2x_v−1| ≥ η.\\n3) Begin the LP relaxation in the balanced case (x_v ≈ 1/2):\\n   - Variables: for a fixed v, frequencies over Q3 isomorphism classes with a marked vertex and their c_v labels; frequencies over pairs of disjoint triples at v and their joint c_v labels; optionally include a minimal set of Q6-face constraints encoding compatibility between the two Q3’s via shared 4-cycles not passing through v.\\n   - Constraints: (i) normalization and marginalization; (ii) the fraction of good Q3 at v is ≥ τ_v ≥ 1/4 − 3/(4n); (iii) Dvořák’s Lemma 9 filters for bad Q3; (iv) symmetry under color swap and coordinate permutations.\\n   - Objective: maximize b subject to these constraints and u_v ≤ ε for all v (the “balanced” regime). If the optimum yields b ≤ 1/2 − γ for some absolute γ, we obtain the desired dichotomy.\\n4) Enumeration task for Q3 classes: catalog all 2-colorings of Q3 up to automorphism; for each class and marked vertex, determine “good/bad” and, for good, list all minimal-change geodesics’ starting colors at the marked vertex. This table will supply exact constraints for (3).\\n\\n## Sanity checks and small examples\\n- For any v, if all good Q3’s containing v are anchored at v (monochromatic star), then u_v = |2x_v−1| and the both-good disagreement probability at v equals 1/2 − (2x_v−1)^2/2 + O(1/n), giving a clear deviation from 1/2 when x_v≠1/2.\\n- In a random coloring (each edge red/blue with prob 1/2 independently), heuristic suggests u_v concentrates near 0 and b≈1/2, matching the expectation that our improvement must come from worst-case structural constraints rather than average-case randomness. The LP aims exactly at the worst-case.\\n\\n## Why this is incremental, auditable progress\\n- The both-good refinement is a precise, verifiable tightening of a step in Dvořák’s estimate; it cleanly introduces a measurable parameter u_v that future steps can bound from below.\\n- The conditional degree-bias improvement gives a family of explicit special cases yielding an immediate δ.\\n- The LP setup is concrete: it targets the balanced regime where the degree-based route fails, and it encodes local consistency that the Kneser graph abstraction ignores. Numerical experimentation on this relaxation can expose a positive margin γ and guide a combinatorial proof.\\n\\n## Open gaps to flag explicitly\\n- output.md currently does not include the both-good refinement; adding it will make transparent how vertex-level biases translate to reduced switches.\\n- We do not yet have a universal lower bound on E_v[u_v^2]. Establishing a dichotomy (either E_v[u_v^2] ≥ δ0 or b ≤ 1/2 − γ0) via the LP is the key next milestone.\\n\"}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"auto","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"ProverOutput","schema_":{"properties":{"progress_md":{"description":"Append-only progress notes","title":"Progress Md","type":"string"}},"required":["progress_md"],"title":"ProverOutput","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":19587,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":18718,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":16128},"total_tokens":38305},"user":null,"store":true}
