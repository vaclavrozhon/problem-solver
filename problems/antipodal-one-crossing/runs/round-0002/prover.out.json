The feedback from the previous round suggests a need for more structured exploration, including formal proofs or empirical evidence to support our claims. Here's a refined mini-plan for this round:\n\n- **Formalize the expander vs. sparse-cut dichotomy**: Develop a more rigorous argument or proof for the deliverable sublemma regarding color conductance in the cube.\n- **Empirical investigation of $Q_3$ density**: Design a small-scale simulation or mathematical model to test the hypothesis that 'good' $Q_3$ subcubes can exceed a density of 1/2.\n\n### Expander vs. Sparse-Cut Dichotomy - Formalization\n\n**Claim:** If a color occupies at least an $\\varepsilon$-fraction of each $\\delta S_J$ for $(1-\\theta)$ of the blocks, then that color has conductance $\\Omega(\\varepsilon)$ in the whole cube.\n\n*How it can fail:* The relationship between block-wise occupancy and overall conductance may not be linear or direct, especially if the distribution of colored edges is not uniform across blocks.\n\n*Toy counterexample:* Consider a cube where $\\varepsilon$-fraction occupancy is achieved by concentrating colored edges in a few blocks, leaving other blocks nearly monochromatic. This could potentially invalidate the linear conductance assumption.\n\n### $Q_3$ Density Improvement - Empirical Investigation\n\n**Claim:** Through a small-scale simulation or mathematical model, we can demonstrate that the density of 'good' $Q_3$ subcubes can be increased beyond 1/2, offering a direct method to reduce the average number of switches required.\n\n*How it can fail:* The simulation or model might not accurately capture the complexities of the $n$-cube or the constraints on 'good' $Q_3$ subcube distribution.\n\n*Toy counterexample:* A specific 2-coloring where 'good' $Q_3$ subcubes are inherently limited by structural constraints, showing that an increase in their density might not be universally achievable.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Develop a formal argument or proof for the deliverable sublemma in the expander vs. sparse-cut dichotomy.\n- Design and execute a small-scale simulation or develop a mathematical model to investigate the potential for $Q_3$ density improvement.",
