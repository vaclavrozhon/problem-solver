The round defines H(r,n) (exact anchored\u2013anchored probability at a vertex with red-degree r), computes the conditional disagreement probability for anchored pairs and shows\nP[\u03c31\u2260\u03c32 | A] = 1/2 \u2212 (9/2)\u00b7t^2 + O(1/n + t^4) with t = r/n \u2212 1/2. Averaging gives an explicit a-term reduction \u0394_a \u2265 (9/64)\u00b7E_v[(r_v/n \u2212 1/2)^2] + O(1/n), so any nontrivial mean-square degree imbalance yields a linear improvement in expected switches. For the remaining balanced-degree regime the round proposes an LP skeleton (star types, 4-cycle classes, Q3 pattern frequencies; marginals, 4-cycle consistency, badness filters) to upper-bound b and either produce \u03b3>0 or expose extremal local statistics. Next concrete tasks are proving H is minimized at r\u2248n/2, formalizing the anchored\u2013anchored inequality in output.md, and enumerating Q3 classes to build/solve the LP. Files relied on: prover-02.out.json, prover-01.out.json, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k (EJC 2020). Verifier: partial success.",

    "Re-validated the spectral KG(n,3) bound and Lemma B; substituting the spectral bound gives an explicit o(1) term but not an improved 3/8 leading constant.",
    "Introduced and exactly counted the anchored\u2013anchored probability H(r,n) = [C(r,3)C(r\u22123,3)+C(b,3)C(b\u22123,3)]/[C(n,3)C(n\u22123,3)]; H(n/2,n) \u2248 1/32.",

    "Provided an LP skeleton for the balanced-degree regime: variables (star-type, 4-cycle classes, Q3 pattern frequencies), constraints (marginalization, 4-cycle consistency, badness filters, symmetry) and objective (maximize b_v).",
    "Clarified the dichotomy: either unbalanced degrees give immediate gain via \u0394_a, or the balanced case must be handled by LP/consistency to force b < 1/2."
