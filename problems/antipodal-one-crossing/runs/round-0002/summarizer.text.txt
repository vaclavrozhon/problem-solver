{"summary_md":"Round 0002 audited output.md and Dvořák (EJC 2020) and introduced a quantitative anchored–anchored analysis that converts local degree-variance into a linear gain in the both-good (a-term) contribution. The round defines H(r,n) (exact anchored–anchored probability at a vertex with red-degree r), computes the conditional disagreement probability for anchored pairs and shows\nP[σ1≠σ2 | A] = 1/2 − (9/2)·t^2 + O(1/n + t^4) with t = r/n − 1/2. Averaging gives an explicit a-term reduction Δ_a ≥ (9/64)·E_v[(r_v/n − 1/2)^2] + O(1/n), so any nontrivial mean-square degree imbalance yields a linear improvement in expected switches. For the remaining balanced-degree regime the round proposes an LP skeleton (star types, 4-cycle classes, Q3 pattern frequencies; marginals, 4-cycle consistency, badness filters) to upper-bound b and either produce γ>0 or expose extremal local statistics. Next concrete tasks are proving H is minimized at r≈n/2, formalizing the anchored–anchored inequality in output.md, and enumerating Q3 classes to build/solve the LP.
