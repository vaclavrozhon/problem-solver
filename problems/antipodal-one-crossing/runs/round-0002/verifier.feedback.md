High-level: Both reports push in a promising direction: make the “both-good” boundary step strictly better than 1/2 by quantifying a per-vertex bias in the f1-chosen start color. Report 01 isolates the right parameter u_v and gives a clean heuristic for the O(1/n) perturbation from the disjointness constraint. Report 02 develops an anchored–anchored subcase that concretely realizes such a bias when the degree at v is unbalanced, and sketches an LP plan for the balanced regime. There are, however, some counting inaccuracies in 02 that must be fixed, and a couple of places where 01’s claims should be stated as an equality up to O(1/n) (rather than a one-sided inequality) and with precise hypotheses on the size of the “good” set.

Specific correctness issues and fixes:
- Report 01 (“both-good” refinement). The structural idea is correct. The perturbation from sampling without replacement and imposing disjointness is indeed O(1/n), but the clean and fully rigorous way to state it is: for any subset T⊆C([n],3) of size t and any labeling c:T→{R,B}, the probability that two uniformly random disjoint elements of T have different c-label equals 2p(1−p) ± O(n^2/t), where p is the red fraction in T. In our application t_v=|G_v| is Θ(n^3), so the error is O(1/n). Also, it is more precise to state an equality with an O(1/n) error term, not only an upper bound. We formalize this as Lemma C and then specialize to T=G_v to obtain the “both-good” disagreement probability at v equals 1/2 − u_v^2/2 + O(1/n). Caution: the global “both-good” boundary probability averages over v with weights proportional to the mass of both-good pairs at v; so one should state the averaged bound with that weighting (not necessarily uniform over v). This does not harm the utility of the parameter u_v.
- Report 02 (anchored–anchored counts). The mixed anchored counts were off: for an ordered pair with first anchored red and second anchored blue, the number is C(r,3)·C(b,3) (not C(b−3,3)); disjointness is automatic across colors because the direction sets are disjoint. Consequently, for a fixed v with r red directions and b:=n−r blue directions, the exact anchored–anchored ordered-pair counts are C(r,3)C(r−3,3) + 2C(r,3)C(b,3) + C(b,3)C(b−3,3), and the conditional disagreement probability among anchored–anchored pairs is 2C(r,3)C(b,3) divided by that total. As n→∞ with x=r/n, the clean asymptotic form is P[disagree|A] = 2x^3(1−x)^3/(x^3+(1−x)^3)^2 + O(1/n), with Taylor expansion near x=1/2 given by 1/2 − 18(x−1/2)^2 + O((x−1/2)^4 + 1/n). This corrects the claimed 9/2 coefficient (the right coefficient is 18) and also corrects H(n/2,n): the anchored–anchored probability at balance is ≈1/16, not 1/32.
- Both reports tacitly use “anchored implies good.” That is standard in Dvořák’s setup, but since we have not yet reproduced that proof inside output.md, we avoid relying on it in the new formal lemma by working with an arbitrary large subset T. In notes we explain how to instantiate T=G_v once we import that fact from Dvořák.

Value triage:
- Solid, reusable progress: (i) the pair-sampling lemma under a disjointness constraint (Lemma C) and its application to the both-good disagreement probability; (ii) the corrected anchored–anchored exact counts and asymptotics; (iii) the degree-imbalance-to-bias lower bound u_v ≳ 6|x_v−1/2| (already implicit in 01), which yields a clean dichotomy framework (unbalanced versus balanced). These are worthwhile to record formally.
- Promising next steps: The LP skeleton (both reports) is a good direction for the balanced regime. Before building it, finish the small but useful anchored–anchored minimization claim (discrete convexity shows the anchored mass is minimized at r≈n/2) and tabulate Q3-types with marked vertex and the f1-choice.

Concrete next-step suggestions:
1) Finish a self-contained proof (or cite Dvořák precisely) that anchored-at-v implies good; then we can use Lemma B immediately to guarantee |G_v|=Θ(n^3) and turn O(n^2/t_v) into O(1/n) uniformly. Add this as a short lemma in output.md.
2) Prove the discrete convexity fact: For F(m)=C(m,3)C(m−3,3), the function H(r,n) = [C(r,3)C(r−3,3)+2C(r,3)C(n−r,3)+C(n−r,3)C(n−r−3,3)]/[C(n,3)C(n−3,3)] is minimized at r∈{⌊n/2⌋,⌈n/2⌉}.
3) Enumerate Q3 2-colorings with a marked vertex up to automorphism, classify good/bad and (for good) the f1-start color at the mark, to feed the LP.
4) Build the first LP in the balanced regime (deg_R(v)=deg_B(v)) with variables for star types, 4-cycle types, and Q3-types with marked v; maximize b under these constraints to seek a universal b≤1/2−γ.
