  "feedback_md": "High-level: Both reports push in a promising direction: make the \u201cboth-good\u201d boundary step strictly better than 1/2 by quantifying a per-vertex bias in the f1-chosen start color. Report 01 isolates the right parameter u_v and gives a clean heuristic for the O(1/n) perturbation from the disjointness constraint. Report 02 develops an anchored\u2013anchored subcase that concretely realizes such a bias when the degree at v is unbalanced, and sketches an LP plan for the balanced regime. There are, however, some counting inaccuracies in 02 that must be fixed, and a couple of places where 01\u2019s claims should be stated as an equality up to O(1/n) (rather than a one-sided inequality) and with precise hypotheses on the size of the \u201cgood\u201d set.\n\nSpecific correctness issues and fixes:\n- Report 01 (\u201cboth-good\u201d refinement). The structural idea is correct. The perturbation from sampling without replacement and imposing disjointness is indeed O(1/n), but the clean and fully rigorous way to state it is: for any subset T\u2286C([n],3) of size t and any labeling c:T\u2192{R,B}, the probability that two uniformly random disjoint elements of T have different c-label equals 2p(1\u2212p) \u00b1 O(n^2/t), where p is the red fraction in T. In our application t_v=|G_v| is \u0398(n^3), so the error is O(1/n). Also, it is more precise to state an equality with an O(1/n) error term, not only an upper bound. We formalize this as Lemma C and then specialize to T=G_v to obtain the \u201cboth-good\u201d disagreement probability at v equals 1/2 \u2212 u_v^2/2 + O(1/n). Caution: the global \u201cboth-good\u201d boundary probability averages over v with weights proportional to the mass of both-good pairs at v; so one should state the averaged bound with that weighting (not necessarily uniform over v). This does not harm the utility of the parameter u_v.\n- Report 02 (anchored\u2013anchored counts). The mixed anchored counts were off: for an ordered pair with first anchored red and second anchored blue, the number is C(r,3)\u00b7C(b,3) (not C(b\u22123,3)); disjointness is automatic across colors because the direction sets are disjoint. Consequently, for a fixed v with r red directions and b:=n\u2212r blue directions, the exact anchored\u2013anchored ordered-pair counts are C(r,3)C(r\u22123,3) + 2C(r,3)C(b,3) + C(b,3)C(b\u22123,3), and the conditional disagreement probability among anchored\u2013anchored pairs is 2C(r,3)C(b,3) divided by that total. As n\u2192\u221e with x=r/n, the clean asymptotic form is P[disagree|A] = 2x^3(1\u2212x)^3/(x^3+(1\u2212x)^3)^2 + O(1/n), with Taylor expansion near x=1/2 given by 1/2 \u2212 18(x\u22121/2)^2 + O((x\u22121/2)^4 + 1/n). This corrects the claimed 9/2 coefficient (the right coefficient is 18) and also corrects H(n/2,n): the anchored\u2013anchored probability at balance is \u22481/16, not 1/32.\n- Both reports tacitly use \u201canchored implies good.\u201d That is standard in Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s setup, but since we have not yet reproduced that proof inside output.md, we avoid relying on it in the new formal lemma by working with an arbitrary large subset T. In notes we explain how to instantiate T=G_v once we import that fact from Dvo\u0159\u00e1k.\n\nValue triage:\n- Solid, reusable progress: (i) the pair-sampling lemma under a disjointness constraint (Lemma C) and its application to the both-good disagreement probability; (ii) the corrected anchored\u2013anchored exact counts and asymptotics; (iii) the degree-imbalance-to-bias lower bound u_v \u2273 6|x_v\u22121/2| (already implicit in 01), which yields a clean dichotomy framework (unbalanced versus balanced). These are worthwhile to record formally.\n- Promising next steps: The LP skeleton (both reports) is a good direction for the balanced regime. Before building it, finish the small but useful anchored\u2013anchored minimization claim (discrete convexity shows the anchored mass is minimized at r\u2248n/2) and tabulate Q3-types with marked vertex and the f1-choice.\n\nConcrete next-step suggestions:\n1) Finish a self-contained proof (or cite Dvo\u0159\u00e1k precisely) that anchored-at-v implies good; then we can use Lemma B immediately to guarantee |G_v|=\u0398(n^3) and turn O(n^2/t_v) into O(1/n) uniformly. Add this as a short lemma in output.md.\n2) Prove the discrete convexity fact: For F(m)=C(m,3)C(m\u22123,3), the function H(r,n) = [C(r,3)C(r\u22123,3)+2C(r,3)C(n\u2212r,3)+C(n\u2212r,3)C(n\u2212r\u22123,3)]/[C(n,3)C(n\u22123,3)] is minimized at r\u2208{\u230an/2\u230b,\u2308n/2\u2309}.\n3) Enumerate Q3 2-colorings with a marked vertex up to automorphism, classify good/bad and (for good) the f1-start color at the mark, to feed the LP.\n4) Build the first LP in the balanced regime (deg_R(v)=deg_B(v)) with variables for star types, 4-cycle types, and Q3-types with marked v; maximize b under these constraints to seek a universal b\u22641/2\u2212\u03b3.\n",
  "new_notes_md": "Refinement of the both-good boundary step via per-vertex bias\n- For a fixed vertex v, let G_v \u2286 C([n],3) denote the collection of 3-sets K for which Q3(v,K) is \u201cgood\u201d in Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s sense. Fix a deterministic tie-breaking for f1 inside each good Q3. Define c_v(K) \u2208 {R,B} as the color of the first edge at v along the f1-path inside Q3(v,K). Let t_v = |G_v|, p_v := |{K\u2208G_v : c_v(K)=R}|/t_v, and u_v := |2p_v \u2212 1|.\n- Sampling heuristic made precise: If we pick two good v-neighbor Q3\u2019s uniformly at random (i.e., two disjoint K,L \u2208 G_v, unordered), the event \u201cboundary switch occurs\u201d equals [c_v(K) \u2260 c_v(L)]. The disjointness constraint perturbs the color distribution only by O(1/n) since each K forbids only O(n^2) partners while t_v = \u0398(n^3) (once we know a constant fraction of triples are good at v).\n\nA general pair-sampling lemma (usable abstractly)\n- Let T \u2286 C([n],3) be any subset of size t, and c: T \u2192 {R,B} any labeling. Let p = |{K\u2208T: c(K)=R}|/t. If we draw an unordered pair {K,L} uniformly from all disjoint pairs with K,L\u2208T, then\n  P[c(K) \u2260 c(L)] = 2p(1\u2212p) \u00b1 O(n^2/t).\n  Proof idea: For any fixed K, the \u201cforbidden\u201d set S_K = {L\u2208T: L\u2229K\u2260\u2205} has size O(n^2), so conditioning L to be disjoint from K changes its color distribution by at most O(|S_K|/t) = O(n^2/t). Averaging over K and expanding E[disagree|K] shows that the deviation from 2p(1\u2212p) is bounded by the average of these perturbations.\n- Application to both-good pairs at v: Taking T = G_v yields\n  P_v[boundary switch | both-good at v] = 1/2 \u2212 u_v^2/2 \u00b1 O(n^2/t_v).\n  By \u201canchored implies good\u201d (imported from Dvo\u0159\u00e1k) and Lemma B, t_v \u2265 (1/4 \u2212 O(1/n))\u00b7C(n,3) = \u0398(n^3), so the error is O(1/n). Note the global \u201cboth-good\u201d boundary probability is a weighted average of the per-v quantities with weights proportional to the mass of both-good pairs at v.\n\nDegree imbalance induces bias in c_v via anchored triples\n- Let r_v be the red degree at v and x_v = r_v/n. Among all triples K with monochromatic stars at v (anchored at v), c_v(K) is forced to be the star color. Consequently, even ignoring non-anchored good triples one gets\n  u_v \u2265 |C(r_v,3) \u2212 C(n\u2212r_v,3)| / (C(r_v,3) + C(n\u2212r_v,3)).\n  For x_v = 1/2 + \u03b7 with |\u03b7| \u226a 1, this gives u_v \u2265 6|\u03b7| + O(\u03b7^3). Therefore, if a positive fraction \u03c1 of vertices satisfy |x_v \u2212 1/2| \u2265 \u03b7_0, then E_v[u_v^2] \u2265 c\u00b7\u03c1\u00b7\u03b7_0^2 for some absolute c>0.\n\nCorrected anchored\u2013anchored counts at a fixed vertex\n- For r=r_v and b=n\u2212r, the number of ordered v-neighbor pairs (K,L) with both cubes anchored at v equals\n  C(r,3)C(r\u22123,3) + 2C(r,3)C(b,3) + C(b,3)C(b\u22123,3).\n  Among these, the pairs with disagreeing star colors at v are exactly the mixed-color ones, counted by 2C(r,3)C(b,3). Therefore,\n  P_v[disagree | both anchored at v] = 2C(r,3)C(b,3) / [C(r,3)C(r\u22123,3) + 2C(r,3)C(b,3) + C(b,3)C(b\u22123,3)].\n  As n\u2192\u221e with x=r/n and t=x\u22121/2,\n  P_v[disagree | anchored] = 2x^3(1\u2212x)^3/(x^3+(1\u2212x)^3)^2 + O(1/n) = 1/2 \u2212 18t^2 + O(t^4 + 1/n).\n  In particular, at balance (x=1/2) the anchored\u2013anchored disagreement probability is 1/2 and the anchored\u2013anchored pair probability is \u2248(x^3+(1\u2212x)^3)^2 = (1/4)^2 = 1/16 (up to O(1/n)), not 1/32.\n\nDichotomy and plan\n- Unbalanced regime: If E_v[(x_v\u22121/2)^2] is bounded below, then E_v[u_v^2] is bounded below, and the both-good boundary term drops by a constant (via the pair-sampling lemma), yielding a linear improvement. Anchored\u2013anchored pairs certify this effect concretely.\n- Balanced regime: When x_v\u22481/2 for most v, we must leverage structural constraints (4-cycle consistency, interaction of good/bad patterns across pairs) to bound b<1/2. Proceed with the proposed LP using: star-type frequencies, 4-cycle types, Q3-types-with-marked-v and their f1-start labels, symmetry constraints, and Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s characterization of bad cubes.\n\nImmediate technical tasks\n- Import or re-prove \u201canchored at v \u21d2 good\u201d to firm up the O(1/n) error uniformly.\n- Prove that the anchored\u2013anchored probability is minimized at r\u2248n/2 for all n\u22656 (discrete convexity of F(m)=C(m,3)C(m\u22123,3) plus symmetry).\n- Enumerate Q3 2-coloring classes with marked v; for each good class determine the f1-start at v. This feeds the LP for b in the balanced regime.\n",

  "new_outputs_md": "Lemma C (Pair-sampling stability under a disjointness constraint)\nStatement. Let n\u22656 and let T\u2286C([n],3) be any subset of 3-sets of size t=|T|. Fix any labeling c: T\u2192{R,B} and write p := |{K\u2208T : c(K)=R}|/t. If an unordered pair {K,L} is drawn uniformly from all pairs with K,L\u2208T and K\u2229L=\u2205, then\n\nP[c(K)\u2260c(L)] = 2p(1\u2212p) \u00b1 C\u00b7(n^2/t),\n\nfor some absolute constant C>0 (independent of n and T).\n\nProof. For K\u2208T, let T_K := {L\u2208T : L\u2229K=\u2205} and write q(K) := |{L\u2208T_K : c(L)=R}|/|T_K|. Let s(K):=1 if c(K)=R and 0 otherwise. If we generate a random unordered disjoint pair by first sampling K uniformly from T and then sampling L uniformly from T_K (and finally forgetting the order), its law is within a factor 2 of the uniform law on unordered disjoint pairs, so computing the disagreement probability under this sequential scheme suffices up to a harmless constant normalization (which cancels in the final equality below).\n\nFor fixed K, the probability of disagreement equals s(K)\u00b7(1\u2212q(K)) + (1\u2212s(K))\u00b7q(K). Averaging over K gives\n\nP[c(K)\u2260c(L)] = E_K[q(K)] + E_K[s(K)] \u2212 2E_K[q(K)\u00b7s(K)].\n\nLet p = E_K[s(K)] and write q(K)=p+\u03b4(K).

For any K, all elements of T that are excluded from T_K (including K itself) lie in the set S_K := {L\u2208T : L\u2229K\u2260\u2205}\u222a{K}. Since K is a 3-set, the number of 3-sets intersecting K is at most 3\u00b7C(n\u22121,2) + 3\u00b7(n\u22121) + 1 = O(n^2). Therefore, removing S_K from T perturbs the color fraction by at most |S_K|/t \u2264 C\u2032\u00b7n^2/t for some absolute C\u2032, i.e., |\u03b4(K)| \u2264 C\u2032\u00b7n^2/t.

Set p_v := |{K\u2208G_v : c_v(K)=R}|/t_v and u_v := |2p_v\u22121|.

In particular, if t_v \u2265 \u03b4\u00b7C(n,3) for some absolute \u03b4>0 (as ensured once one imports that every monochromatic star at v is good), then the error term is O(1/n).\n\nProof.
