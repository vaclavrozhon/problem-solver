  "feedback_md": "### Detailed feedback for the prover\n\n- **Expander vs. Sparse-Cut Dichotomy - Formalization**: The claim regarding color conductance based on block-wise occupancy is intriguing but lacks a rigorous mathematical foundation. The relationship between block occupancy and global conductance needs a formal proof, especially considering the potential non-uniformity of colored edge distribution. The toy counterexample provided is a good start but requires a more detailed exploration to assess the claim's validity.\n\n- **$Q_3$ Density Improvement - Empirical Investigation**: The idea of increasing 'good' $Q_3$ subcube density is promising but currently speculative. The approach lacks a clear methodology for proving or demonstrating the feasibility of this density improvement. The toy counterexample points out a significant challenge, but a systematic analysis or empirical evidence is needed to substantiate the claim.\n\n**Next Steps**: The proposed next steps indicate a move towards a more structured and evidence-based approach, which is positive. However, for both claims, a clear outline of the intended formal proofs or the design of empirical investigations is crucial. Specifically, for the expander vs. sparse-cut dichotomy, a detailed mathematical proof is needed. For the $Q_3$ density improvement, a well-defined simulation or analytical model that can accurately capture the complexities of the $n$-cube and the distribution of 'good' $Q_3$ subcubes is essential.",
