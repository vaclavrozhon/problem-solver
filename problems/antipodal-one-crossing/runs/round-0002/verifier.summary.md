High-level: Both reports push in a promising direction: make the “both-good” boundary step strictly better than 1/2 by quantifying a per-vertex bias in the f1-chosen start color. Report 01 isolates the right parameter u_v and gives a clean heuristic for the O(1/n) perturbation from the disjointness constraint. Report 02 develops an anchored–anchored subcase that concretely realizes such a bias when the degree at v is unbalanced, and sketches an LP plan for the balanced regime. There are, however, some counting inaccuracies in 02 that must be fixed, and a couple of places where 01’s claims should be stated as an equality up to O(1/n) (rather than a one-sided inequality) and with precise hypotheses on the size of the “good” set.
