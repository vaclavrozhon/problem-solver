Note: The numerical corollary \u201c(3/8 + 1/(8(n\u22123)) + o(1))\u00b7n\u201d is not an improvement on 3/8; it only makes the o(1) explicit.\n- Lemma C (pair-sampling under disjointness) and Corollary D (both-good disagreement at v equals 1/2 \u2212 u_v^2/2 \u00b1 O(1/n)) are in good shape; the O(n^2/t) error with t=\u0398(n^3) yields O(1/n) as intended.\n- Missing ingredients to be added later: (i) an explicit import/citation that \u201canchored at v \u21d2 good Q3\u201d (Dvo\u0159\u00e1k Lemma 8) to justify t_v=\u0398(n^3) uniformly; (ii) a clean integration of Corollary D into Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s expected-switch calculation (it currently appears only as a local bound at v); and (iii) a refined anchored\u2013anchored counting lemma with exact formulas and asymptotics (see below).\n- Important correction (for our ongoing notes): in Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s proof, the expected number of switches inside a Q3-block is 1 \u2212 p/2 (not 1 \u2212 p^2). The final bound (1/3 + b/12 + o(1))\u00b7n comes from 1 \u2212 p/2 + (b/2 + (1/2 + o(1))a) and p = a + b/2.\n\nKey new lemmas and quantitative refinements (ready to curate next)\n1) Anchored\u2013anchored pair mass at a vertex and its minimizer.\n- Fix a vertex v with r red and b:=n\u2212r blue incident edges. For an ordered disjoint pair of 3-sets (K,L) at v, both cubes Q3(v,K) and Q3(v,L) are anchored at v iff the three edges at v in the directions of K are monochromatic, and likewise for L. The exact anchored\u2013anchored ordered-pair count equals\n  C(r,3)C(r\u22123,3) + 2 C(r,3)C(b,3) + C(b,3)C(b\u22123,3),\n  and the denominator (all ordered disjoint pairs) equals C(n,3)C(n\u22123,3). Thus the anchored\u2013anchored probability at v is\n  H(r,n) = [C(r,3)C(r\u22123,3) + 2 C(r,3)C(b,3) + C(b,3)C(b\u22123,3)] / [C(n,3)C(n\u22123,3)].\n- As n\u2192\u221e with x=r/n, H(r,n) = (x^3 + (1\u2212x)^3)^2 + O(1/n), which is minimized at x=1/2 (since s(x):=x^3+(1\u2212x)^3 is minimized at 1/2). Hence for all large n, H(r,n) \u2265 1/16 \u2212 O(1/n), with equality asymptotically at r\u2248n/2. Next step: give a discrete proof (monotonicity of H(r+1,n)\u2212H(r,n) changing sign at \u230an/2\u230b) valid for all n\u22656.\n\n2) Unconditional lower bound on a (both cubes good).\n- \u201cAnchored at v \u21d2 good\u201d (Dvo\u0159\u00e1k Lemma 8) implies that anchored\u2013anchored pairs are a subset of both-good pairs. Therefore, averaging over v and the (uniform) choice of a v-neighbor pair,\n  a \u2265 E_v[H(r_v,n)].\n- Using the asymptotic from (1), we obtain a uniform, absolute lower bound:\n  a \u2265 1/16 \u2212 O(1/n).\n- Strengthening: One can avoid asymptotics by a direct application of Lemma C to the anchored-triple set T_v (of size t_v^anc = C(r_v,3)+C(n\u2212r_v,3)): for a random disjoint pair from all triples, P[both anchored at v] = \u03c4_v^2 \u00b1 O(1/n). Since \u03c4_v is minimized at r_v\u2248n/2 and \u03c4_v \u2265 1/4 \u2212 3/(4n) (Lemma B), the anchored\u2013anchored mass at v is \u2265 (1/4 \u2212 3/(4n))^2 \u2212 O(1/n), yielding the same absolute bound a \u2265 1/16 \u2212 O(1/n).\n\n3) Anchored\u2013anchored disagreement probability and its quadratic drop from 1/2.\n- Conditioning on both being anchored at v, the exact disagreement probability equals\n  P_v[disagree | anchored] = 2 C(r,3) C(b,3) / [C(r,3)C(r\u22123,3) + 2 C(r,3)C(b,3) + C(b,3)C(b\u22123,3)].\n- As n\u2192\u221e with x=r/n and t=x\u22121/2,\n  P_v[disagree | anchored] = 2x^3(1\u2212x)^3 / (x^3+(1\u2212x)^3)^2 + O(1/n)\n                           = 1/2 \u2212 18 t^2 + O(t^4 + 1/n).\n  Thus, for vertices with degree imbalance |x\u22121/2|\u2265\u03b7, anchored\u2013anchored pairs alone produce a drop below 1/2 of order \u2126(\u03b7^2).\n\nIntegrating into Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s boundary step (unconditional quantitative gain)\n- In Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s calculation, the boundary contribution across the k\u22121 junctions is bounded by (b/2 + (1/2 + o(1)) a)\u00b7(n/3). Using (2)\u2013(3), we can refine the both-good (a-term) contribution without invoking any additional structure:\n  \u2022 Let J denote the event \u201cat a random junction, the two neighboring Q3\u2019s are both anchored at their shared vertex.\u201d By the above, P[J] = E_v[\u03c4_v^2] \u00b1 O(1/n) \u2265 (1/16 \u2212 o(1)).\n  \u2022 On J, the boundary switch probability is 1/2 \u2212 18 E_v[(x_v\u22121/2)^2 | J] + o(1); off J but still in the both-good case we keep the crude 1/2 bound.\n  \u2022 Therefore, the unconditional both-good boundary-switch probability drops from (1/2)\u00b7a by at least\n    \u0394_total \u2265 18\u00b7E_v[(x_v\u22121/2)^2 \u00b7 1_J] \u2212 o(1) = 18\u00b7E_v[T_v\u00b7\u03c4_v^2] \u2212 o(1),\n    where T_v:=(x_v\u22121/2)^2 and we used P[J | v] = \u03c4_v^2 \u00b1 O(1/n).\n- Consequently, the expected number of switches satisfies the refined inequality\n  E[switches] \u2264 [ (1 \u2212 p/2) + (b/2 + (1/2)a \u2212 \u0394_total) ]\u00b7(n/3) + o(n)\n               = (1/3 + b/12)\u00b7n \u2212 (\u0394_total/3)\u00b7n + o(n).\n- Using \u03c4_v \u2265 1/4 \u2212 O(1/n), we obtain a clean unconditional corollary:\n  E[switches] \u2264 (1/3 + b/12)\u00b7n \u2212 6\u00b7E_v[T_v]\u00b7(1/16 \u2212 o(1))\u00b7n + o(n)\n               = (1/3 + b/12)\u00b7n \u2212 (3/8)\u00b7E_v[T_v]\u00b7n + o(n).\n  Thus, in any coloring with nontrivial mean-square degree imbalance E_v[T_v] \u2265 \u03b5, we gain a linear improvement of magnitude (3\u03b5/8 \u2212 o(1))\u00b7n over the baseline (1/3 + b/12)\u00b7n. The balanced-degree regime (E_v[T_v] \u2248 0) remains the hard case, where we must force b \u2264 1/2 \u2212 \u03b3 via structural constraints.\n\nWhy useful here\n- The anchored\u2013anchored analysis yields two robust facts: an absolute lower bound a \u2265 1/16 \u2212 o(1), and a quantitative drop of the both-good boundary switch probability by a term \u2265 18\u00b7E_v[T_v\u00b7\u03c4_v^2] \u2212 o(1). These are unconditional and compatible with Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s scheme. They give an explicit, checkable source of savings whenever degree variance is non-negligible, sharply isolating the balanced-degree regime for further work on b.\n\nExamples and sanity checks\n- Perfectly balanced degrees (r_v \u2261 n/2): \u03c4_v \u2248 1/4, H \u2248 1/16, P[disagree | anchored] = 1/2; our refinement produces no gain, as expected.\n- Biased degrees (say x_v \u2261 1/2+0.1 on a positive fraction of vertices): T_v = 0.01. Then P[disagree | anchored] \u2248 1/2 \u2212 0.18, and \u03c4_v \u2248 0.251..., so \u0394_total \u2273 18\u00b70.01\u00b7(0.25)^2 \u2248 0.01125, giving an absolute reduction of about 0.00375\u00b7n switches after the (1/3) factor\u2014substantial at scale.\n\nObstacles and open technical points\n- Discrete minimization: Provide a self-contained proof (no asymptotics) that H(r,n) is minimized at r\u2208{\u230an/2\u230b,\u2308n/2\u2309} for all n\u22656.\n- Weighting caveat: The \u201cboth-good\u201d boundary probability is an average over vertices weighted by the mass of both-good v-neighbor pairs. We sidestepped this by extracting an unconditional \u0394_total via anchored\u2013anchored pairs. A stronger refinement (using Corollary D\u2019s u_v) should control the conditional drop 1/2 \u2212 P[switch | both-good] by a weighted average of u_v^2; formalizing a lower bound on the weighted mean in terms of E_v[u_v^2] would further improve the statement. A natural route is to show Cov(t_v^2, u_v^2) \u2265 0 (t_v is the count of good triples at v), yielding a weighted-average \u2265 uniform-average inequality.\n- Balanced regime: We still need to push b \u2264 1/2 \u2212 \u03b3 using local consistency (4-cycles, badness structure). This remains the central challenge.\n\nNext steps (concrete, auditable)\n1) Curate two new lemmas into output.md:\n   - Lemma E (Anchored\u2013anchored mass and a\u22651/16 \u2212 O(1/n)) with a short proof via Lemma C and Lemma B.\n   - Lemma F (Anchored\u2013anchored disagreement probability and the 1/2 \u2212 18t^2 expansion), with a precise derivation as above.\n   Then state the refined global inequality: E[switches] \u2264 (1/3 + b/12)\u00b7n \u2212 (\u0394_total/3)\u00b7n + o(n), with \u0394_total \u2265 18\u00b7E_v[T_v\u00b7\u03c4_v^2] \u2212 o(1).\n2) Prove discrete minimization of H(r,n): Show H(r+1,n)\u2212H(r,n) changes sign exactly once at \u230an/2\u230b (discrete convexity of r\u21a6C(r,3) and a careful telescoping argument on the product terms).\n3) Balanced-degree regime LP: Begin the LP in the symmetric case r_v\u2261n/2. Variables: frequencies of 4-cycle types at v; frequencies of Q3 pattern classes with a marked vertex and their f1-start color. Constraints: marginalization, 4-cycle consistency, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k badness filter (Lemma 9). Objective: maximize b subject to these constraints. Deliverable: a numerical upper bound strictly below 1/2 (even \u03b3\u224810^{-3} would be compelling).\n4) Enumerate Q3 types with a marked vertex (up to automorphism), classify good/bad and, for good, the f1-start color at the mark. This feeds (3) and also allows a refined both-good analysis beyond anchored cubes.\n\nWhy this is progress\n- We obtained an absolute lower bound a\u22651/16\u2212o(1) and a concrete, unconditional reduction \u0394_total in the both-good boundary term proportional to the mean-square degree imbalance. These are new, testable refinements within Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s framework. They carve out the balanced regime as the sole obstruction and set up the LP attack on b \u2264 1/2 \u2212 \u03b3 under local consistency constraints.\n"
