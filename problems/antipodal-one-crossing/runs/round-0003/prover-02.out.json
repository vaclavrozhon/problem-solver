  "progress_md": "Round 0003 \u2014 Correcting a key mis-citation (p vs. p/2), anchoring-based refinement of the a-term, exact anchored\u2013anchored counts, uniformity of boundary vertices, and a clean global inequality\n\nSummary and audit of output.md\n- Sound pieces: Theorem A (KG(n,3) spectral MAX-CUT for b), Lemma B (monochromatic-star fraction), Lemma C + Corollary D (pair-sampling under disjointness and the u_v parameter) are correct and useful.\n- Missing explicit import: output.md uses in the Remark that \u201canchored-at-v cubes are good,\u201d but does not restate/prove it. This is Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s Lemma 8. I recommend adding it as a self-contained lemma (I provide a short proof sketch below) so we can invoke it to ensure t_v = \u0398(n^3) uniformly in v.\n- Important correction (from the PDF): In Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s proof, the expected number of color changes inside a Q3-block contributes 1 \u2212 p/2 per block (not 1 \u2212 p^2). This is essential for the cancellation to give (1/3 + b/12 + o(1))\u00b7n. Some of my Round 0001 notes used 1 \u2212 p^2; that was an error. All refinements below use the correct 1 \u2212 p/2 baseline.\n\nNew, checkable lemmas/propositions to add\n1) Lemma E (Anchored at v implies good; Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s Lemma 8). If at some vertex of a Q3 the three incident edges are monochromatic, then the Q3 is good.\n- Utility here: Guarantees that \u201canchored\u201d cubes are a subset of good, allowing us to quantify a nontrivial anchored\u2013anchored submass within the both-good case.\n- Proof sketch (as in Dvo\u0159\u00e1k): Assume 000 has all three blue edges. If all edges in the opposite square are red, we immediately have three monochromatic antipodal geodesics disjoint from 000\u2013111 and one blue antipodal geodesic through 000, totaling \u22642 changes. If some edge there is blue, a short case-check (as in the paper) creates two disjoint monochromatic antipodal geodesics, forcing goodness by the definition. This can be restated verbatim from Lemma 8 in the EJC note.\n\n2) Lemma F (Exact anchored\u2013anchored counts at a fixed vertex and the disagreement probability).\n- Setup: Fix v. Let r=r_v be the red degree, b=n\u2212r. Consider ordered pairs (K,L) of v-neighbor Q3\u2019s (disjoint 3-sets). Say a Q3 is \u201canchored red at v\u201d if all three edges at v in that Q3 are red, and analogously for blue.\n- Exact counts:\n  \u2022 Both anchored red: C(r,3)\u00b7C(r\u22123,3).\n  \u2022 Both anchored blue: C(b,3)\u00b7C(b\u22123,3).\n  \u2022 One anchored red, one anchored blue: 2\u00b7C(r,3)\u00b7C(b,3).\n  \u2022 Total ordered disjoint pairs: C(n,3)\u00b7C(n\u22123,3).\n- Therefore, the anchored\u2013anchored probability (at v) is\n  H(r,n) = [ C(r,3)C(r\u22123,3) + 2C(r,3)C(b,3) + C(b,3)C(b\u22123,3) ] / [ C(n,3)C(n\u22123,3) ].\n- Conditional disagreement probability among anchored pairs at v (star colors \u03c31,\u03c32 at v):\n  P_v[\u03c31\u2260\u03c32 | anchored at v] = 2C(r,3)C(b,3) / [ C(r,3)C(r\u22123,3) + 2C(r,3)C(b,3) + C(b,3)C(b\u22123,3) ].\n- Asymptotics: With x=r/n and t=x\u22121/2, as n\u2192\u221e,\n  \u2022 H(r,n) = (x^3+(1\u2212x)^3)^2 + O(1/n) after normalizing by the denominator, hence H minimized at x=1/2 and H(1/2,n) = 1/16 + O(1/n).\n  \u2022 P_v[\u03c31\u2260\u03c32 | anchored] = 2x^3(1\u2212x)^3 / (x^3+(1\u2212x)^3)^2 + O(1/n) = 1/2 \u2212 18t^2 + O(t^4 + 1/n).\n- Why useful: This gives an explicit, vertex-wise, anchored-driven bias away from 1/2 in the both-good boundary step, proportional to t^2 and with anchored mass H(r,n).\n\n3) Proposition G (Uniformity of the shared boundary vertex under the random-geodesic scheme).\n- Claim: In Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s random antipodal geodesic model (uniform start vertex v0 and uniform coordinate permutation), for any fixed j in {1,\u2026,k\u22121}, the shared vertex v3j at the j-th boundary is uniformly distributed over V(Q_n). Consequently, any bounded function \u03c6(v) satisfies E[\u03c6(v3j)] = E_v[\u03c6(v)], the uniform average over vertices.\n- Proof sketch: v3j = v0 \u2295 S where S is a uniformly random j-th 3-subset of coordinates from the permutation. For any fixed y, the number of (v0,S) pairs producing y equals the number of (v0,S) pairs producing 0 (by translation invariance), so y is equiprobable. Averaging over j (uniformly in {1,\u2026,k\u22121}) preserves uniformity. This justifies replacing boundary-vertex averages by uniform E_v[\u00b7].\n\nRefined global bound integrating anchoring\n- Boundary switch step: For a fixed boundary j with shared vertex v=v3j, the color-change probability is bounded by\n  P[switch at boundary j] \u2264 b/2 + a/2 \u2212 E_v[ (1/2 \u2212 P_v[\u03c31\u2260\u03c32 | anchored at v]) \u00b7 H(r_v,n) ] + o(1).\n  Here \u03c3i is the f1-chosen color at v for the i-th Q3; for anchored-good cubes, \u03c3i equals the star color at v, and \u201canchored \u21d2 good\u201d ensures we can subtract the anchored improvement unconditionally. The o(1) comes from the O(1/n) error in Lemma F and the negligible pairs sharing more than one vertex (as in Dvo\u0159\u00e1k).\n- Using Lemma F\u2019s expansion, write T_v := (r_v/n \u2212 1/2)^2. Then\n  (1/2 \u2212 P_v[\u03c31\u2260\u03c32 | anchored]) = 18T_v + O(T_v^2 + 1/n).\n  Thus the anchored savings per boundary satisfy\n  \u0394_anchor := E_v[ (1/2 \u2212 P_v[\u03c31\u2260\u03c32 | anchored]) \u00b7 H(r_v,n) ] \u2265 18\u00b7E_v[ T_v\u00b7H(r_v,n) ] + O(1/n).\n- Interior Q3 step: The correct baseline is 1 \u2212 p/2 per block. Summing over blocks and boundaries (k\u2248n/3) and inserting p=a+b/2 gives the refined expectation\n  E[switches] \u2264 (n/3)\u00b7[ (1 \u2212 p/2) + (a/2 + b/2) \u2212 \u0394_anchor + o(1) ]\n                  = (n/3)\u00b7[ 1 + b/4 \u2212 \u0394_anchor + o(1) ]\n                  = (1/3 + b/12 \u2212 (1/3)\u00b7\u0394_anchor + o(1))\u00b7n.\n- Consequence (unbalanced-degree regime): Since H is minimized at balance with H(1/2,n)=1/16+O(1/n), we obtain the explicit inequality\n  E[switches] \u2264 (1/3 + b/12 \u2212 6\u00b7E_v[T_v]\u00b7(1/16 + O(1/n)) + o(1))\u00b7n\n              = (1/3 + b/12 \u2212 (3/8)\u00b7E_v[T_v] + o(1))\u00b7n.\n  Therefore, if the mean-square degree-imbalance E_v[T_v] \u2265 \u03c4 for some absolute \u03c4>0, we get a linear improvement \u03b4 \u2265 (3/8)\u00b7\u03c4.\n- Hard case isolated: The only regime where this anchored refinement fails to give a constant gain is the \u201cbalanced\u201d one with E_v[T_v]\u21920. This exactly isolates where we must force b \u2264 1/2 \u2212 \u03b3 via additional structure (4-cycles, Q3-type constraints), matching the LP plan from Round 0002.\n\nSmall discrete convexity fact (to be added; proof next round)\n- Claim: For n\u22658, H(r,n) is minimized at r\u2208{\u230an/2\u230b,\u2308n/2\u2309}.\n- Rationale: The leading term is proportional to (C(r,3)+C(n\u2212r,3))^2, whose base C(r,3)+C(n\u2212r,3) is discrete-convex and minimized at balance (Lemma B). The (\u22123)-shifts in C(r\u22123,3) produce O(1/n) corrections that preserve the minimizer for n large. I will provide a clean discrete argument (or a short rearrangement bound) next round.\n\nExamples and sanity checks\n- Balanced coloring (deg_R(v)\u2261n/2): H\u22481/16 and P[\u03c31\u2260\u03c32 | anchored]\u22481/2, so \u0394_anchor\u22480 and the bound reverts to Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s 1/3 + b/12 (no gain here), exactly as expected.\n- Degree-biased coloring: If a fixed fraction \u03c1 of vertices have |r_v/n \u2212 1/2|\u2265\u03b7, then E_v[T_v]\u2265\u03c1\u03b7^2 and the anchored refinement yields a gain \u2265(3/8)\u03c1\u03b7^2 on the constant in front of n (up to o(1)).\n\nObstacles\n- We have not yet added \u201canchored implies good\u201d as a formal lemma to output.md; current remarks rely on it tacitly. This should be included explicitly (with proof or precise citation) to make the error bounds uniform.\n- The minimization of H(r,n) at balance requires a short but explicit discrete argument; while clear asymptotically, I will supply a fully discrete proof to avoid asymptotic handwaving.\n- Balanced regime: The anchored refinement yields no improvement when E_v[T_v] is tiny. Here we must execute the LP/SDP program to show b \u2264 1/2 \u2212 \u03b3 using 4-cycle and Q3-type consistency.\n\nNext steps (auditable)\n1) Add Lemma E (\u201canchored \u21d2 good\u201d) to output.md with a short proof (or explicit citation to Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s Lemma 8).\n2) Add Lemma F to output.md: exact anchored\u2013anchored counts and the asymptotic expansion P_v[\u03c31\u2260\u03c32 | anchored] = 1/2 \u2212 18T_v + O(T_v^2 + 1/n). Provide the elementary calculation.\n3) Add Proposition G to output.md: uniformity of shared boundary vertex under the random-geodesic model. This justifies averaging over v.\n4) State and prove the refined global inequality: E[switches] \u2264 (1/3 + b/12 \u2212 6\u00b7E_v[T_v\u00b7H(r_v,n)] + o(1))\u00b7n. This cleanly quantifies the anchored-driven savings.\n5) Prove the discrete minimization: H(r,n) minimized at r\u2248n/2 (all n\u22658). Conclude E_v[T_v\u00b7H(r_v,n)] \u2265 (1/16\u2212O(1/n))\u00b7E_v[T_v].\n6) Balanced-regime LP: Start with the deg_R(v)=n/2 symmetric case; enumerate Q3 2-colorings with a marked vertex, tag good/bad and f1-start color at the mark, encode 4-cycle consistency, and maximize b. Numerical solution will guide an analytic \u03b3>0.\n\nWhy this advances the program\n- We corrected a crucial mis-citation (1 \u2212 p/2 vs. 1 \u2212 p^2) and derived a rigorous, quantified refinement that converts degree variance into a linear constant gain via anchored\u2013anchored pairs, with fully explicit counts.\n- This yields an immediate \u03b4-improvement in a large and natural structural regime (nontrivial degree variance), and narrows the hard case to the near-balanced regime, for which we have a concrete LP plan.\n\nGaps explicitly flagged for output.md\n- Include Lemma E (anchored \u21d2 good) explicitly.\n- Incorporate Lemma F and Proposition G to formalize the anchored-based refinement and the uniformity of boundary-vertex averaging.\n- Update any place where 1 \u2212 p^2 was (mis)used to the correct 1 \u2212 p/2.\n"
