We derived exact vertex-wise counts for ordered anchored\u2013anchored Q3 pairs and showed asymptotically H(r,n) = (x^3+(1\u2212x)^3)^2+O(1/n), minimized at x=1/2, giving an unconditional a \u2265 1/16 \u2212 O(1/n). Conditioning on both anchored at v yields the expansion P[disagree | anchored] = 1/2 \u2212 18\u00b7(x\u22121/2)^2 + O((x\u22121/2)^4 + 1/n). Correcting the interior-block baseline to 1\u2212p/2 and averaging uniformly over boundary vertices yields the refined global bound E[switches] \u2264 (1/3 + b/12)\u00b7n \u2212 (\u0394_total/3)\u00b7n + o(n) with \u0394_total \u2265 18\u00b7E_v[T_v\u00b7\u03c4_v^2] \u2212 o(1). Consequently any mean-square degree imbalance E_v[T_v] \u2265 \u03b5 yields a linear saving \u2273(3\u03b5/8)\u00b7n, isolating the near-balanced-degree case as the remaining hard regime. Key next steps are to include the explicit \u201canchored \u21d2 good\u201d lemma, give a discrete minimization proof for H(r,n), and run the LP attack on the balanced case.",
