## Round 0003 — Anchored–anchored refinement, unconditional a-lower bound, and integrating a quantitative gain into Dvořák’s boundary term

Status and quick audit of output.md
- Theorem A (KG(n,3) spectral MAX-CUT bound for b) and Lemma B (monochromatic-star fraction τ_v) look correct and useful as book-keeping tools. Note: The numerical corollary “(3/8 + 1/(8(n−3)) + o(1))·n” is not an improvement on 3/8; it only makes the o(1) explicit.
- Lemma C (pair-sampling under disjointness) and Corollary D (both-good disagreement at v equals 1/2 − u_v^2/2 ± O(1/n)) are in good shape; the O(n^2/t) error with t=Θ(n^3) yields O(1/n) as intended.
- Missing ingredients to be added later: (i) an explicit import/citation that “anchored at v ⇒ good Q3” (Dvořák Lemma 8) to justify t_v=Θ(n^3) uniformly; (ii) a clean integration of Corollary D into Dvořák’s expected-switch calculation (it currently appears only as a local bound at v); and (iii) a refined anchored–anchored counting lemma with exact formulas and asymptotics (see below).
- Important correction (for our ongoing notes): in Dvořák’s proof, the expected number of switches inside a Q3-block is 1 − p/2 (not 1 − p^2). The final bound (1/3 + b/12 + o(1))·n comes from 1 − p/2 + (b/2 + (1/2 + o(1))a) and p = a + b/2.

Key new lemmas and quantitative refinements (ready to curate next)
1) Anchored–anchored pair mass at a vertex and its minimizer.
- Fix a vertex v with r red and b:=n−r blue incident edges. For an ordered disjoint pair of 3-sets (K,L) at v, both cubes Q3(v,K) and Q3(v,L) are anchored at v iff the three edges at v in the directions of K are monochromatic, and likewise for L. The exact anchored–anchored ordered-pair count equals
  C(r,3)C(r−3,3) + 2 C(r,3)C(b,3) + C(b,3)C(b−3,3),
  and the denominator (all ordered disjoint pairs) equals C(n,3)C(n−3,3). Thus the anchored–anchored probability at v is
  H(r,n) = [C(r,3)C(r−3,3) + 2 C(r,3)C(b,3) + C(b,3)C(b−3,3)] / [C(n,3)C(n−3,3)].
- As n→∞ with x=r/n, H(r,n) = (x^3 + (1−x)^3)^2 + O(1/n), which is minimized at x=1/2 (since s(x):=x^3+(1−x)^3 is minimized at 1/2). Hence for all large n, H(r,n) ≥ 1/16 − O(1/n), with equality asymptotically at r≈n/2. Next step: give a discrete proof (monotonicity of H(r+1,n)−H(r,n) changing sign at ⌊n/2⌋) valid for all n≥6.

2) Unconditional lower bound on a (both cubes good).
- “Anchored at v ⇒ good” (Dvořák Lemma 8) implies that anchored–anchored pairs are a subset of both-good pairs. Therefore, averaging over v and the (uniform) choice of a v-neighbor pair,
  a ≥ E_v[H(r_v,n)].
- Using the asymptotic from (1), we obtain a uniform, absolute lower bound:
  a ≥ 1/16 − O(1/n).
- Strengthening: One can avoid asymptotics by a direct application of Lemma C to the anchored-triple set T_v (of size t_v^anc = C(r_v,3)+C(n−r_v,3)): for a random disjoint pair from all triples, P[both anchored at v] = τ_v^2 ± O(1/n). Since τ_v is minimized at r_v≈n/2 and τ_v ≥ 1/4 − 3/(4n) (Lemma B), the anchored–anchored mass at v is ≥ (1/4 − 3/(4n))^2 − O(1/n), yielding the same absolute bound a ≥ 1/16 − O(1/n).

3) Anchored–anchored disagreement probability and its quadratic drop from 1/2.
- Conditioning on both being anchored at v, the exact disagreement probability equals
  P_v[disagree | anchored] = 2 C(r,3) C(b,3) / [C(r,3)C(r−3,3) + 2 C(r,3)C(b,3) + C(b,3)C(b−3,3)].
- As n→∞ with x=r/n and t=x−1/2,
  P_v[disagree | anchored] = 2x^3(1−x)^3 / (x^3+(1−x)^3)^2 + O(1/n)
                           = 1/2 − 18 t^2 + O(t^4 + 1/n).
  Thus, for vertices with degree imbalance |x−1/2|≥η, anchored–anchored pairs alone produce a drop below 1/2 of order Ω(η^2).

Integrating into Dvořák’s boundary step (unconditional quantitative gain)
- In Dvořák’s calculation, the boundary contribution across the k−1 junctions is bounded by (b/2 + (1/2 + o(1)) a)·(n/3). Using (2)–(3), we can refine the both-good (a-term) contribution without invoking any additional structure:
  • Let J denote the event “at a random junction, the two neighboring Q3’s are both anchored at their shared vertex.” By the above, P[J] = E_v[τ_v^2] ± O(1/n) ≥ (1/16 − o(1)).
  • On J, the boundary switch probability is 1/2 − 18 E_v[(x_v−1/2)^2 | J] + o(1); off J but still in the both-good case we keep the crude 1/2 bound.
  • Therefore, the unconditional both-good boundary-switch probability drops from (1/2)·a by at least
    Δ_total ≥ 18·E_v[(x_v−1/2)^2 · 1_J] − o(1) = 18·E_v[T_v·τ_v^2] − o(1),
    where T_v:=(x_v−1/2)^2 and we used P[J | v] = τ_v^2 ± O(1/n).
- Consequently, the expected number of switches satisfies the refined inequality
  E[switches] ≤ [ (1 − p/2) + (b/2 + (1/2)a − Δ_total) ]·(n/3) + o(n)
               = (1/3 + b/12)·n − (Δ_total/3)·n + o(n).
- Using τ_v ≥ 1/4 − O(1/n), we obtain a clean unconditional corollary:
  E[switches] ≤ (1/3 + b/12)·n − 6·E_v[T_v]·(1/16 − o(1))·n + o(n)
               = (1/3 + b/12)·n − (3/8)·E_v[T_v]·n + o(n).
  Thus, in any coloring with nontrivial mean-square degree imbalance E_v[T_v] ≥ ε, we gain a linear improvement of magnitude (3ε/8 − o(1))·n over the baseline (1/3 + b/12)·n. The balanced-degree regime (E_v[T_v] ≈ 0) remains the hard case, where we must force b ≤ 1/2 − γ via structural constraints.

Why useful here
- The anchored–anchored analysis yields two robust facts: an absolute lower bound a ≥ 1/16 − o(1), and a quantitative drop of the both-good boundary switch probability by a term ≥ 18·E_v[T_v·τ_v^2] − o(1). These are unconditional and compatible with Dvořák’s scheme. They give an explicit, checkable source of savings whenever degree variance is non-negligible, sharply isolating the balanced-degree regime for further work on b.

Examples and sanity checks
- Perfectly balanced degrees (r_v ≡ n/2): τ_v ≈ 1/4, H ≈ 1/16, P[disagree | anchored] = 1/2; our refinement produces no gain, as expected.
- Biased degrees (say x_v ≡ 1/2+0.1 on a positive fraction of vertices): T_v = 0.01. Then P[disagree | anchored] ≈ 1/2 − 0.18, and τ_v ≈ 0.251..., so Δ_total ≳ 18·0.01·(0.25)^2 ≈ 0.01125, giving an absolute reduction of about 0.00375·n switches after the (1/3) factor—substantial at scale.

Obstacles and open technical points
- Discrete minimization: Provide a self-contained proof (no asymptotics) that H(r,n) is minimized at r∈{⌊n/2⌋,⌈n/2⌉} for all n≥6.
- Weighting caveat: The “both-good” boundary probability is an average over vertices weighted by the mass of both-good v-neighbor pairs. We sidestepped this by extracting an unconditional Δ_total via anchored–anchored pairs. A stronger refinement (using Corollary D’s u_v) should control the conditional drop 1/2 − P[switch | both-good] by a weighted average of u_v^2; formalizing a lower bound on the weighted mean in terms of E_v[u_v^2] would further improve the statement. A natural route is to show Cov(t_v^2, u_v^2) ≥ 0 (t_v is the count of good triples at v), yielding a weighted-average ≥ uniform-average inequality.
- Balanced regime: We still need to push b ≤ 1/2 − γ using local consistency (4-cycles, badness structure). This remains the central challenge.

Next steps (concrete, auditable)
1) Curate two new lemmas into output.md:
   - Lemma E (Anchored–anchored mass and a≥1/16 − O(1/n)) with a short proof via Lemma C and Lemma B.
   - Lemma F (Anchored–anchored disagreement probability and the 1/2 − 18t^2 expansion), with a precise derivation as above.
   Then state the refined global inequality: E[switches] ≤ (1/3 + b/12)·n − (Δ_total/3)·n + o(n), with Δ_total ≥ 18·E_v[T_v·τ_v^2] − o(1).
2) Prove discrete minimization of H(r,n): Show H(r+1,n)−H(r,n) changes sign exactly once at ⌊n/2⌋ (discrete convexity of r↦C(r,3) and a careful telescoping argument on the product terms).
3) Balanced-degree regime LP: Begin the LP in the symmetric case r_v≡n/2. Variables: frequencies of 4-cycle types at v; frequencies of Q3 pattern classes with a marked vertex and their f1-start color. Constraints: marginalization, 4-cycle consistency, Dvořák badness filter (Lemma 9). Objective: maximize b subject to these constraints. Deliverable: a numerical upper bound strictly below 1/2 (even γ≈10^{-3} would be compelling).
4) Enumerate Q3 types with a marked vertex (up to automorphism), classify good/bad and, for good, the f1-start color at the mark. This feeds (3) and also allows a refined both-good analysis beyond anchored cubes.

Why this is progress
- We obtained an absolute lower bound a≥1/16−o(1) and a concrete, unconditional reduction Δ_total in the both-good boundary term proportional to the mean-square degree imbalance. These are new, testable refinements within Dvořák’s framework. They carve out the balanced regime as the sole obstruction and set up the LP attack on b ≤ 1/2 − γ under local consistency constraints.

Round 0003 — Correcting a key mis-citation (p vs. p/2), anchoring-based refinement of the a-term, exact anchored–anchored counts, uniformity of boundary vertices, and a clean global inequality

Summary and audit of output.md
- Sound pieces: Theorem A (KG(n,3) spectral MAX-CUT for b), Lemma B (monochromatic-star fraction), Lemma C + Corollary D (pair-sampling under disjointness and the u_v parameter) are correct and useful.
- Missing explicit import: output.md uses in the Remark that “anchored-at-v cubes are good,” but does not restate/prove it. This is Dvořák’s Lemma 8. I recommend adding it as a self-contained lemma (I provide a short proof sketch below) so we can invoke it to ensure t_v = Θ(n^3) uniformly in v.
- Important correction (from the PDF): In Dvořák’s proof, the expected number of color changes inside a Q3-block contributes 1 − p/2 per block (not 1 − p^2). This is essential for the cancellation to give (1/3 + b/12 + o(1))·n. Some of my Round 0001 notes used 1 − p^2; that was an error. All refinements below use the correct 1 − p/2 baseline.

New, checkable lemmas/propositions to add
1) Lemma E (Anchored at v implies good; Dvořák’s Lemma 8). If at some vertex of a Q3 the three incident edges are monochromatic, then the Q3 is good.
- Utility here: Guarantees that “anchored” cubes are a subset of good, allowing us to quantify a nontrivial anchored–anchored submass within the both-good case.
- Proof sketch (as in Dvořák): Assume 000 has all three blue edges. If all edges in the opposite square are red, we immediately have three monochromatic antipodal geodesics disjoint from 000–111 and one blue antipodal geodesic through 000, totaling ≤2 changes. If some edge there is blue, a short case-check (as in the paper) creates two disjoint monochromatic antipodal geodesics, forcing goodness by the definition. This can be restated verbatim from Lemma 8 in the EJC note.

2) Lemma F (Exact anchored–anchored counts at a fixed vertex and the disagreement probability).
- Setup: Fix v. Let r=r_v be the red degree, b=n−r. Consider ordered pairs (K,L) of v-neighbor Q3’s (disjoint 3-sets). Say a Q3 is “anchored red at v” if all three edges at v in that Q3 are red, and analogously for blue.
- Exact counts:
  • Both anchored red: C(r,3)·C(r−3,3).
  • Both anchored blue: C(b,3)·C(b−3,3).
  • One anchored red, one anchored blue: 2·C(r,3)·C(b,3).
  • Total ordered disjoint pairs: C(n,3)·C(n−3,3).
- Therefore, the anchored–anchored probability (at v) is
  H(r,n) = [ C(r,3)C(r−3,3) + 2C(r,3)C(b,3) + C(b,3)C(b−3,3) ] / [ C(n,3)C(n−3,3) ].
- Conditional disagreement probability among anchored pairs at v (star colors σ1,σ2 at v):
  P_v[σ1≠σ2 | anchored at v] = 2C(r,3)C(b,3) / [ C(r,3)C(r−3,3) + 2C(r,3)C(b,3) + C(b,3)C(b−3,3) ].
- Asymptotics: With x=r/n and t=x−1/2, as n→∞,
  • H(r,n) = (x^3+(1−x)^3)^2 + O(1/n) after normalizing by the denominator, hence H minimized at x=1/2 and H(1/2,n) = 1/16 + O(1/n).
  • P_v[σ1≠σ2 | anchored] = 2x^3(1−x)^3 / (x^3+(1−x)^3)^2 + O(1/n) = 1/2 − 18t^2 + O(t^4 + 1/n).
- Why useful: This gives an explicit, vertex-wise, anchored-driven bias away from 1/2 in the both-good boundary step, proportional to t^2 and with anchored mass H(r,n).

3) Proposition G (Uniformity of the shared boundary vertex under the random-geodesic scheme).
- Claim: In Dvořák’s random antipodal geodesic model (uniform start vertex v0 and uniform coordinate permutation), for any fixed j in {1,…,k−1}, the shared vertex v3j at the j-th boundary is uniformly distributed over V(Q_n). Consequently, any bounded function φ(v) satisfies E[φ(v3j)] = E_v[φ(v)], the uniform average over vertices.
- Proof sketch: v3j = v0 ⊕ S where S is a uniformly random j-th 3-subset of coordinates from the permutation. For any fixed y, the number of (v0,S) pairs producing y equals the number of (v0,S) pairs producing 0 (by translation invariance), so y is equiprobable. Averaging over j (uniformly in {1,…,k−1}) preserves uniformity. This justifies replacing boundary-vertex averages by uniform E_v[·].

Refined global bound integrating anchoring
- Boundary switch step: For a fixed boundary j with shared vertex v=v3j, the color-change probability is bounded by
  P[switch at boundary j] ≤ b/2 + a/2 − E_v[ (1/2 − P_v[σ1≠σ2 | anchored at v]) · H(r_v,n) ] + o(1).
  Here σi is the f1-chosen color at v for the i-th Q3; for anchored-good cubes, σi equals the star color at v, and “anchored ⇒ good” ensures we can subtract the anchored improvement unconditionally. The o(1) comes from the O(1/n) error in Lemma F and the negligible pairs sharing more than one vertex (as in Dvořák).
- Using Lemma F’s expansion, write T_v := (r_v/n − 1/2)^2. Then
  (1/2 − P_v[σ1≠σ2 | anchored]) = 18T_v + O(T_v^2 + 1/n).
  Thus the anchored savings per boundary satisfy
  Δ_anchor := E_v[ (1/2 − P_v[σ1≠σ2 | anchored]) · H(r_v,n) ] ≥ 18·E_v[ T_v·H(r_v,n) ] + O(1/n).
- Interior Q3 step: The correct baseline is 1 − p/2 per block. Summing over blocks and boundaries (k≈n/3) and inserting p=a+b/2 gives the refined expectation
  E[switches] ≤ (n/3)·[ (1 − p/2) + (a/2 + b/2) − Δ_anchor + o(1) ]
                  = (n/3)·[ 1 + b/4 − Δ_anchor + o(1) ]
                  = (1/3 + b/12 − (1/3)·Δ_anchor + o(1))·n.
- Consequence (unbalanced-degree regime): Since H is minimized at balance with H(1/2,n)=1/16+O(1/n), we obtain the explicit inequality
  E[switches] ≤ (1/3 + b/12 − 6·E_v[T_v]·(1/16 + O(1/n)) + o(1))·n
              = (1/3 + b/12 − (3/8)·E_v[T_v] + o(1))·n.
  Therefore, if the mean-square degree-imbalance E_v[T_v] ≥ τ for some absolute τ>0, we get a linear improvement δ ≥ (3/8)·τ.
- Hard case isolated: The only regime where this anchored refinement fails to give a constant gain is the “balanced” one with E_v[T_v]→0. This exactly isolates where we must force b ≤ 1/2 − γ via additional structure (4-cycles, Q3-type constraints), matching the LP plan from Round 0002.

Small discrete convexity fact (to be added; proof next round)
- Claim: For n≥8, H(r,n) is minimized at r∈{⌊n/2⌋,⌈n/2⌉}.
- Rationale: The leading term is proportional to (C(r,3)+C(n−r,3))^2, whose base C(r,3)+C(n−r,3) is discrete-convex and minimized at balance (Lemma B). The (−3)-shifts in C(r−3,3) produce O(1/n) corrections that preserve the minimizer for n large. I will provide a clean discrete argument (or a short rearrangement bound) next round.

Examples and sanity checks
- Balanced coloring (deg_R(v)≡n/2): H≈1/16 and P[σ1≠σ2 | anchored]≈1/2, so Δ_anchor≈0 and the bound reverts to Dvořák’s 1/3 + b/12 (no gain here), exactly as expected.
- Degree-biased coloring: If a fixed fraction ρ of vertices have |r_v/n − 1/2|≥η, then E_v[T_v]≥ρη^2 and the anchored refinement yields a gain ≥(3/8)ρη^2 on the constant in front of n (up to o(1)).

Obstacles
- We have not yet added “anchored implies good” as a formal lemma to output.md; current remarks rely on it tacitly. This should be included explicitly (with proof or precise citation) to make the error bounds uniform.
- The minimization of H(r,n) at balance requires a short but explicit discrete argument; while clear asymptotically, I will supply a fully discrete proof to avoid asymptotic handwaving.
- Balanced regime: The anchored refinement yields no improvement when E_v[T_v] is tiny. Here we must execute the LP/SDP program to show b ≤ 1/2 − γ using 4-cycle and Q3-type consistency.

Next steps (auditable)
1) Add Lemma E (“anchored ⇒ good”) to output.md with a short proof (or explicit citation to Dvořák’s Lemma 8).
2) Add Lemma F to output.md: exact anchored–anchored counts and the asymptotic expansion P_v[σ1≠σ2 | anchored] = 1/2 − 18T_v + O(T_v^2 + 1/n). Provide the elementary calculation.
3) Add Proposition G to output.md: uniformity of shared boundary vertex under the random-geodesic model. This justifies averaging over v.
4) State and prove the refined global inequality: E[switches] ≤ (1/3 + b/12 − 6·E_v[T_v·H(r_v,n)] + o(1))·n. This cleanly quantifies the anchored-driven savings.
5) Prove the discrete minimization: H(r,n) minimized at r≈n/2 (all n≥8). Conclude E_v[T_v·H(r_v,n)] ≥ (1/16−O(1/n))·E_v[T_v].
6) Balanced-regime LP: Start with the deg_R(v)=n/2 symmetric case; enumerate Q3 2-colorings with a marked vertex, tag good/bad and f1-start color at the mark, encode 4-cycle consistency, and maximize b. Numerical solution will guide an analytic γ>0.

Why this advances the program
- We corrected a crucial mis-citation (1 − p/2 vs. 1 − p^2) and derived a rigorous, quantified refinement that converts degree variance into a linear constant gain via anchored–anchored pairs, with fully explicit counts.
- This yields an immediate δ-improvement in a large and natural structural regime (nontrivial degree variance), and narrows the hard case to the near-balanced regime, for which we have a concrete LP plan.

Gaps explicitly flagged for output.md
- Include Lemma E (anchored ⇒ good) explicitly.
- Incorporate Lemma F and Proposition G to formalize the anchored-based refinement and the uniformity of boundary-vertex averaging.
- Update any place where 1 − p^2 was (mis)used to the correct 1 − p/2.
