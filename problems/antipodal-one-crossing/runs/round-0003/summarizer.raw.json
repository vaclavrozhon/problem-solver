We derived exact vertex-wise counts for ordered anchored–anchored Q3 pairs and showed asymptotically H(r,n) = (x^3+(1−x)^3)^2+O(1/n), minimized at x=1/2, giving an unconditional a ≥ 1/16 − O(1/n). Conditioning on both anchored at v yields the expansion P[disagree | anchored] = 1/2 − 18·(x−1/2)^2 + O((x−1/2)^4 + 1/n). Correcting the interior-block baseline to 1−p/2 and averaging uniformly over boundary vertices yields the refined global bound E[switches] ≤ (1/3 + b/12)·n − (Δ_total/3)·n + o(n) with Δ_total ≥ 18·E_v[T_v·τ_v^2] − o(1). Consequently any mean-square degree imbalance E_v[T_v] ≥ ε yields a linear saving ≳(3ε/8)·n, isolating the near-balanced-degree case as the remaining hard regime.
