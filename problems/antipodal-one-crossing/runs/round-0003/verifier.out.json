  "feedback_md": "Both reports make solid, compatible progress on the anchored\u2013anchored substructure and its leverage in Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s scheme. I agree with the key correction: the per-block interior contribution is 1 \u2212 p/2 (not 1 \u2212 p^2), and the cancellation with p = a + b/2 leads to the (1/3 + b/12 + o(1))\u00b7n baseline. Both reports\u2019 anchored\u2013anchored counting formula at a fixed vertex v with r red and b=n\u2212r blue incident edges is correct, as is the conditional disagreement probability and its expansion 1/2 \u2212 18t^2 + O(t^4 + 1/n) for t = r/n \u2212 1/2. These are valuable and clean inputs. \n\nTwo rigor points to fix before using them globally:\n- When lower-bounding a via anchored\u2013anchored pairs, one must not invoke Lemma C (which is about sampling within a fixed T) directly. The event \u201cboth triples lie in T_v\u201d is a membership event relative to the universe of all triples; what is needed is a simple, separate \u2018membership under disjointness\u2019 lemma: for any T\u2286C([n],3) with |T| = \u03c4\u00b7C(n,3), if (K,L) is a uniform ordered disjoint pair from all triples, then P[K\u2208T and L\u2208T] = \u03c4^2 \u00b1 O(1/n). This follows from a one-line conditioning argument using |S_K| = C(n,3) \u2212 C(n\u22123,3) = O(n^2). I include and prove this as Lemma E0 in output.md and then deduce the unconditional a \u2265 1/16 \u2212 O(1/n) via Lemma B (monochromatic stars) and \u201canchored \u21d2 good.\u201d\n- The uniformity of the shared boundary vertex in the random geodesic model should be stated and proved (Proposition G). This justifies vertex-wise averaging at boundaries. I include a short proof by translation invariance.\n\nValue triage:\n- The anchored\u2013anchored counts and the 1/2 \u2212 18t^2 drop are correct and highly useful. They cleanly turn degree variance into a quantitative savings in the both-good boundary term. I keep these with full proofs (Lemma F) and record the unconditional lower bound a \u2265 1/16 \u2212 O(1/n) (Corollary H) in output.md.\n- The proposed refined global inequality integrating \u0394_anchor is promising; however, to keep output.md fully rigorous, I refrain from adding it until the boundary-weighting and o(1) terms are written out precisely. The ingredients needed (anchored mass, disagreement bias, uniform boundary vertex) are now in place; what is missing is a careful replication of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s boundary accounting that isolates and subtracts the anchored contribution without double-counting.\n\nConcrete next steps:\n1) Formalize the boundary step: write the exact expectation for boundary switches over j, condition on the shared vertex v3j, insert the anchored mass H(r_v,n) and the anchored disagreement bias, control the remainder by O(1/n), and derive a clean inequality of the form E[switches] \u2264 (1/3 + b/12 \u2212 (1/3)\u00b7\u0394_anchor + o(1))\u00b7n with an explicit \u0394_anchor.\n2) Prove discrete minimization of H(r,n): analyze \u0394H(r) = H(r+1,n) \u2212 H(r,n) and show a unique sign change at \u230an/2\u230b. A telescoping or discrete convexity argument on C(\u00b7,3)C(\u00b7\u22123,3) should suffice.\n3) Balanced regime program: enumerate Q3-types with a marked vertex; for good types, record the f1-start color at the mark. Build the LP with variables for 4-cycle types and marked-Q3 types, enforce marginal and 4-cycle consistency plus Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s badness characterization, and maximize b. A numerical upper bound b \u2264 1/2 \u2212 \u03b3 (even \u03b3\u224810^{-3}) would be a major step.\n4) Optional strengthening: bound the both-good boundary drop in terms of E_v[u_v^2] (the f1-start bias), avoiding anchors by using Corollary D. This needs a careful treatment of the weighting of v by the mass of both-good pairs; proving a suitable correlation inequality or deriving a robust lower bound in terms of unweighted averages would sharpen the gain.\n\nAll key new facts and their proofs (anchored \u21d2 good citation, anchored\u2013anchored counts, membership under disjointness, uniform boundary vertex, the unconditional a bound) are now curated into output.md. The remaining integration into the global bound should be the focus of the next round.",
  "new_notes_md": "Additions and refinements (Round 0003)\n\n1) Correction to the baseline interior contribution\n- In Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s scheme the expected number of color changes inside a Q3-block is 1 \u2212 p/2 per block (not 1 \u2212 p^2). With p = a + b/2 this yields the baseline (1/3 + b/12 + o(1))\u00b7n for E[switches].\n\n2) Anchored cubes and a uniform nontrivial anchored mass\n- Anchored-at-v cubes (three edges at v all the same color in the chosen 3 directions) are good (Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, Lemma 8). Consequently, anchored\u2013anchored neighboring pairs form a subset of both-good pairs. For a vertex v with r red and b=n\u2212r blue incident edges, the exact anchored\u2013anchored (ordered) pair probability is\n  H(r,n) = [ C(r,3)C(r\u22123,3) + 2C(r,3)C(b,3) + C(b,3)C(b\u22123,3) ] / [ C(n,3)C(n\u22123,3) ].\n  As n\u2192\u221e with x=r/n, H(r,n) = (x^3 + (1\u2212x)^3)^2 + O(1/n), minimized at x=1/2; hence H(r,n) \u2265 1/16 \u2212 O(1/n).\n- A discrete, uniform lower bound that avoids minimizing H directly follows from a general \u201cmembership under disjointness\u201d lemma: if T\u2286C([n],3) has density \u03c4, then for a uniform ordered disjoint pair (K,L) from all triples, P[K,L\u2208T] = \u03c4^2 \u00b1 O(1/n). Applying this to the anchored set T_v gives P[both anchored at v] = \u03c4_v^2 \u00b1 O(1/n), and since \u03c4_v \u2265 1/4 \u2212 3/(4n) (Lemma B), we conclude a \u2265 1/16 \u2212 O(1/n) unconditionally.\n\n3) Anchored\u2013anchored disagreement probability\n- Conditioning on both Q3\u2019s being anchored at v, the exact disagreement probability at v equals\n  P_v[disagree | anchored] = 2C(r,3)C(b,3) / [ C(r,3)C(r\u22123,3) + 2C(r,3)C(b,3) + C(b,3)C(b\u22123,3) ].\n  With x=r/n and t=x\u22121/2, as n\u2192\u221e,\n  P_v[disagree | anchored] = 2x^3(1\u2212x)^3 / (x^3+(1\u2212x)^3)^2 + O(1/n) = 1/2 \u2212 18t^2 + O(t^4 + 1/n).\n  Thus degree imbalance |t|\u2265\u03b7 enforces a quadratic drop below 1/2 in the both-good boundary switch probability on the anchored submass.\n\n4) Uniformity of boundary vertices in the random-geodesic model\n- In Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s random antipodal geodesic scheme (uniform start vertex and uniform coordinate permutation), the shared vertex v_{3j} at each boundary j is uniformly distributed over V(Q_n). Hence vertex-averages at boundaries equal uniform averages over V(Q_n).\n\n5) Path to a refined global bound\n- Let T_v = (r_v/n \u2212 1/2)^2. Using the anchored\u2013anchored mass and the anchored disagreement drop, one can define a nonnegative anchored savings \u0394_anchor \u2248 E_v[H(r_v,n)\u00b7(1/2 \u2212 P_v[disagree | anchored])]. Inserting this at each boundary yields a refined inequality of the schematic form\n  E[switches] \u2264 (1/3 + b/12 \u2212 (1/3)\u00b7\u0394_anchor + o(1))\u00b7n.\n  Using H(r,n) \u2265 1/16 \u2212 O(1/n) and the 18T_v drop gives an unconditional gain \u2273 (3/8)\u00b7E_v[T_v]\u00b7n in regimes with nontrivial degree variance. Formalizing this integration (with accurate o(1) control and precise weights) is the next task.\n\n6) Open technical point\n- Discrete minimization: prove that H(r,n) is minimized at r\u2208{\u230an/2\u230b,\u2308n/2\u2309} for all n\u22656. A direct sign analysis of H(r+1,n)\u2212H(r,n) should suffice.\n",

Let n\u22656 and let T\u2286C([n],3) have cardinality |T| = \u03c4\u00b7C(n,3). Let (K,L) be a uniformly random ordered pair of disjoint 3-sets from C([n],3). Then\n\tP[K\u2208T and L\u2208T] = \u03c4^2 \u00b1 C\u00b7(1/n)\nfor some absolute constant C>0 (independent of n and T).\n\nProof. Generate (K,L) by first choosing K uniformly from C([n],3) and then choosing L uniformly from the family of 3-sets disjoint from K. Let M:=C(n,3) and S_K be the set of triples intersecting K, so |S_K|=M\u2212C(n\u22123,3)=O(n^2). Then\n\tP[L\u2208T | K] = (|T| \u2212 |T\u2229S_K|) / (M \u2212 |S_K|) = \u03c4 + \u03b5(K),\nwith |\u03b5(K)| \u2264 max{|T\u2229S_K|, \u03c4|S_K|}/(M\u2212|S_K|) \u2264 c/n for some absolute c>0, since |T\u2229S_K|\u2264|S_K|=O(n^2) and M\u2212|S_K|=C(n\u22123,3)=\u0398(n^3).

In Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s framework for Q3-blocks, if a 3-cube Q3 has a vertex v such that the three edges incident to v within Q3 are monochromatic, then Q3 is good (in the sense used by the modified-geodesic scheme).\n\nProof. This is Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s Lemma 8 (see Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, \u201cA note on edge-colorings of the hypercube\u201d [exact citation as in the original source]). A short case analysis shows that from a monochromatic 3-star at v one can construct the required monochromatic antipodal geodesics (or the canonical f1-path with the requisite bound on color changes), hence goodness. We invoke the lemma as a quoted result. \u220e\n\nLemma F (Anchored\u2013anchored counts and disagreement probability at a fixed vertex)\nStatement. Fix a vertex v of Q_n. Let r be the number of red edges incident to v, and let b:=n\u2212r. Consider ordered pairs (K,L) of disjoint 3-sets of coordinates. A Q3(v,K) is \u201canchored red at v\u201d if all three edges from v in directions K are red, and analogously for blue. Then:\n- The number of ordered disjoint pairs (K,L) with both Q3\u2019s anchored at v equals\n\tC(r,3)\u00b7C(r\u22123,3) + 2\u00b7C(r,3)\u00b7C(b,3) + C(b,3)\u00b7C(b\u22123,3).\n- The total number of ordered disjoint pairs equals C(n,3)\u00b7C(n\u22123,3).\n- Therefore, the anchored\u2013anchored probability at v is\n\tH(r,n) = [ C(r,3)C(r\u22123,3) + 2 C(r,3)C(b,3) + C(b,3)C(b\u22123,3) ] / [ C(n,3)C(n\u22123,3) ].\n- Among anchored\u2013anchored pairs, the conditional disagreement probability at v (i.e., the two star colors at v differ) is\n\tP_v[disagree | anchored at v] = 2 C(r,3) C(b,3) / [ C(r,3)C(r\u22123,3) + 2 C(r,3)C(b,3) + C(b,3)C(b\u22123,3) ].\nMoreover, as n\u2192\u221e with x=r/n and t=x\u22121/2,\n\tH(r,n) = (x^3 + (1\u2212x)^3)^2 + O(1/n),\n\tP_v[disagree | anchored] = 1/2 \u2212 18 t^2 + O(t^4 + 1/n).\n\nProof. The counts are immediate: choose K by selecting 3 directions of the appropriate color, then choose L as any disjoint triple of the indicated color pattern; the factor 2 accounts for the ordered mixed-color case. The total number of ordered disjoint pairs is C(n,3) choices for K times C(n\u22123,3) choices for L. Dividing yields the probabilities.\nFor the asymptotics, write r = xn and b = (1\u2212x)n. Using C(m,3) = m^3/6 + O(m^2), the numerator of H equals [r^3 + b^3]^2/36 + O(n^5) and the denominator equals n^6/36 + O(n^5), so H = [(x^3+(1\u2212x)^3)^2] + O(1/n). For the disagreement expansion, observe that\n\tP_v[disagree | anchored] = 2 [x^3(1\u2212x)^3]/[x^3+(1\u2212x)^3]^2.\nSetting x = 1/2 + t and using x(1\u2212x) = 1/4 \u2212 t^2 and x^3+(1\u2212x)^3 = 1 \u2212 3x(1\u2212x) = 1/4 + 3t^2 gives\n\tP_v[disagree | anchored] = 2(1/4 \u2212 t^2)^3 / (1/4 + 3t^2)^2 = 1/2 \u2212 18 t^2 + O(t^4),\nwith an additional O(1/n) from the binomial-to-polynomial approximation. \u220e\n\nCorollary H (Unconditional lower bound on a)\nStatement. Let a denote the probability that two uniformly random neighboring Q3\u2019s (sharing exactly one vertex) are both good. Then\n\ta \u2265 1/16 \u2212 O(1/n).\n\nProof. Fix a vertex v and let T_v be the set of 3-sets whose stars at v are monochromatic. By Lemma B, |T_v|/C(n,3) = \u03c4_v \u2265 1/4 \u2212 3/(4n). By Lemma E (anchored \u21d2 good), any pair with K,L\u2208T_v yields two good Q3\u2019s; hence, among ordered neighboring pairs with shared vertex v, the probability that both are good is at least P[K,L\u2208T_v]. By Lemma E0, P[K,L\u2208T_v] = \u03c4_v^2 \u00b1 O(1/n). Therefore, for each v,\n\tP[both good | shared vertex v] \u2265 (1/4 \u2212 3/(4n))^2 \u2212 O(1/n) = 1/16 \u2212 O(1/n).\nBy vertex-transitivity (the number of neighboring pairs sharing v is the same for all v), the global parameter a is the uniform average of these per-v probabilities, so the same lower bound holds for a. \u220e\n\nProposition G (Uniformity of the shared boundary vertex)\nStatement. In Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s random antipodal geodesic model (uniform start vertex v0 and uniform random permutation of coordinates), for any fixed j in {1,\u2026,\u230an/3\u230b\u22121}, the shared vertex v_{3j} at the j-th block boundary is uniformly distributed over V(Q_n). Consequently, for any bounded function \u03c6 on V(Q_n), E[\u03c6(v_{3j})] = (1/|V|)\u2211_{v} \u03c6(v).\n\nProof. We have v_{3j} = v0 \u2295 S_j, where S_j is the XOR of the first 3j coordinate directions of the permutation. For any fixed y, the number of pairs (v0,S_j) producing y equals the number producing 0 (translation-invariance of Q_n). Hence v_{3j} is uniform. Linearity gives the averaging statement. \u220e\n",
