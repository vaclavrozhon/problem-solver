Both reports make solid, compatible progress on the anchored–anchored substructure and its leverage in Dvořák’s scheme. I agree with the key correction: the per-block interior contribution is 1 − p/2 (not 1 − p^2), and the cancellation with p = a + b/2 leads to the (1/3 + b/12 + o(1))·n baseline. Both reports’ anchored–anchored counting formula at a fixed vertex v with r red and b=n−r blue incident edges is correct, as is the conditional disagreement probability and its expansion 1/2 − 18t^2 + O(t^4 + 1/n) for t = r/n − 1/2. These are valuable and clean inputs.
