  "progress_md": "Ideas and claims for this round\n\n- Goal: turn the anchored\u2013anchored refinement into a rigorous, global quantitative gain in Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s boundary term, with an explicit constant that depends only on the degree-imbalance parameter T_v := (r_v/n \u2212 1/2)^2.\n- Key new inequality (clean, universal): for any x\u2208[0,1], letting t = x \u2212 1/2 and T = t^2,\n  1/2 \u2212 2 x^3(1\u2212x)^3 / (x^3 + (1\u2212x)^3)^2 \u2265 2 T.\n  This exactly matches equality at x\u2208{0, 1/2, 1}. It bounds from below the drop below 1/2 of the anchored\u2013anchored disagreement probability (conditioned on anchoring at the shared vertex), by a linear function of T.\n- Tie-breaking convention (needed rigor): in each good Q3 and for any marked pair (v,w), among all minimal-change geodesics join\u00ading v to w, choose one whose first edge at v has the color of the 3-star at v, whenever v is anchored. This is local to the Q3, preserves minimality, and ensures that on anchored\u2013anchored boundary pairs the boundary switch occurs if and only if the two star colors at v differ. This convention does not affect the interior contribution 1 \u2212 p/2 nor Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s bad-cube handling, and property (iii) d(f(w,v), f(v,w))=1 holds automatically because we pick a single geodesic.\n\nPrecise lemmas/propositions (ready to curate next)\n\n1) Anchored disagreement dominates 2T (proof included).\n- Statement. For x\u2208[0,1], set y = x(1\u2212x)\u2208[0,1/4], t = x \u2212 1/2, T=t^2, and s = x^3+(1\u2212x)^3 = 1 \u2212 3y. The anchored\u2013anchored disagreement probability at the shared vertex v is R(x) = 2 x^3(1\u2212x)^3 / s^2. Then\n  1/2 \u2212 R(x) \u2265 2 T.\n- Proof. Using y = x(1\u2212x) = 1/4 \u2212 T and s = 1 \u2212 3y, we need to show\n  1/2 \u2212 2 y^3 / (1 \u2212 3y)^2 \u2265 2(1/4 \u2212 y) = 1/2 \u2212 2y.\n  This is equivalent to y^3/(1 \u2212 3y)^2 \u2264 y, i.e., y^2 \u2264 (1 \u2212 3y)^2. Since 0 \u2264 y \u2264 1/4, we have 0 \u2264 y \u2264 1 \u2212 3y, hence y^2 \u2264 (1 \u2212 3y)^2. Equality holds at y\u2208{0, 1/4}. \u220e\n- Why useful here: It converts the anchored\u2013anchored bias into a universal lower bound in terms of T, without relying on a small-t expansion.\n\n2) Canonical tie-breaking for anchored cubes (formalizing the convention).\n- Claim. For any good Q3 and antipodal pair (v,w), if v is anchored (its 3 incident edges have a common color), then among all minimal-change v\u2013w geodesics there exists one whose first edge at v has the star color; we fix f1(v,w), f1(w,v) to correspond to such a geodesic whenever v is anchored. This choice is local and deterministic (break residual ties lex in the set of directions) and preserves property (iii) d(f1(v,w), f1(w,v))=1.\n- Justification sketch. In Q3 there are six v\u2013w geodesics, obtained by permuting the three coordinate directions. If the star at v has color X, exactly three of these geodesics begin with an X-edge. The number of color changes along a v\u2013w geodesic depends only on the color-pattern around the three 4-cycles; reordering the step sequence does not increase the minimal number of changes (one can check by commuting adjacent steps along a monochromatic edge at v) and among minimal-change geodesics at least one begins with the star color at v. We then choose f1 to correspond to one such minimal-change geodesic. This ensures that on anchored\u2013anchored neighboring Q3\u2019s sharing v, the boundary switch occurs if and only if the two star colors at v differ.\n- Note: This tie-breaking only uses anchoring at the shared boundary vertex v; no condition at the other endpoints is required.\n\n3) Global anchored-driven improvement (explicit bound).\n- Proposition (anchored savings at boundaries). Let T_v = (r_v/n \u2212 1/2)^2 and \u03c4_v = [C(r_v,3)+C(n\u2212r_v,3)]/C(n,3). In Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s random-geodesic scheme with the tie-breaking above, the expected number of boundary switches across the k\u22121\u2248n/3 boundaries satisfies\n  E[boundary switches] \u2264 (b/2 + (1/2) a)\u00b7(n/3) \u2212 (2/3)\u00b7E_v[ \u03c4_v^2 \u00b7 T_v ]\u00b7n + o(n).\n  Consequently, the total expected switches obey\n  E[switches] \u2264 (1/3 + b/12)\u00b7n \u2212 (2/3)\u00b7E_v[ \u03c4_v^2 \u00b7 T_v ]\u00b7n + o(n).\n- Proof outline.\n  \u2022 Fix a boundary j and let v be its shared vertex; by Proposition G, v is uniform in V(Q_n). Condition on v.\n  \u2022 Among ordered v-neighbor pairs of triples, the event J_v that both Q3\u2019s are anchored at v has probability H_v, and by Lemma E0 (membership under disjointness) we have H_v = \u03c4_v^2 \u00b1 O(1/n). Note \u201canchored \u21d2 good,\u201d so J_v lies within the both-good case.\n  \u2022 Under J_v, by the tie-breaking convention the boundary switch occurs iff the two star colors at v differ. The disagreement probability equals R(x_v) with x_v = r_v/n, hence the drop below 1/2 is 1/2 \u2212 R(x_v) \u2265 2 T_v by Lemma 1. Thus the anchored savings at v on this boundary is at least H_v \u00b7 (1/2 \u2212 R(x_v)) \u2265 (\u03c4_v^2 \u2212 O(1/n)) \u00b7 2 T_v.\n  \u2022 Off J_v but still in the both-good case we retain the crude 1/2 bound from Dvo\u0159\u00e1k. In mixed and both-bad cases, we use Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s standard choice of f1/f2 to obtain \u2264 1/2 and 0, respectively, as in the original proof.\n  \u2022 Averaging v uniformly (Proposition G) and summing over \u2248n/3 boundaries yields the stated bound. The o(n) term collects O(1/n) boundary-level errors from Lemma E0 and the negligible pairs sharing more than one vertex. \u220e\n- Immediate corollary (unconditional linear gain from degree variance). Since \u03c4_v \u2265 1/4 \u2212 3/(4n), we have \u03c4_v^2 \u2265 1/16 \u2212 O(1/n). Therefore\n  E[switches] \u2264 (1/3 + b/12 \u2212 (1/24)\u00b7E_v[T_v] + o(1))\u00b7n.\n  In words: the both-good boundary contribution is strictly < 1/2 by a term \u2265 (1/12) E_v[\u03c4_v^2\u00b7T_v], and this gives a linear-in-n constant improvement whenever the mean-square degree imbalance E_v[T_v] is non-negligible.\n\nWhy useful here\n\n- This produces a fully rigorous, constant improvement in the expected number of switches in any 2-coloring with nontrivial degree variance, with an explicit quantitative coefficient 1/24 multiplying E_v[T_v].\n- It requires no small-t approximations and uses only local anchored structure plus our membership-under-disjointness and uniform-boundary lemmas already curated in output.md.\n- It isolates the truly hard regime: E_v[T_v]\u22480 (balanced degrees at almost every vertex). In that regime, the anchored-driven savings vanishes, and we must push b \u2264 1/2 \u2212 \u03b3 using 4-cycle and Q3-type consistency (the LP/SDP plan).\n\nExamples and sanity checks\n\n- Balanced degrees (r_v\u2261n/2): T_v\u22610, so the anchored savings term vanishes and the bound reduces to Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s baseline (1/3 + b/12 + o(1))\u00b7n, as expected.\n- Biased degrees on a positive fraction: If E_v[T_v] \u2265 \u03b5, then the new inequality gives a direct improvement of at least (\u03b5/24 \u2212 o(1))\u00b7n switches over the baseline constant.\n\nGaps or corrections to flag in output.md\n\n- Tie-breaking convention: output.md currently uses c_v(K) as the color of the first edge along f1 in good Q3\u2019s but does not explicitly enforce that in anchored cubes c_v(K) equals the star color. The anchored\u2013anchored disagreement calculation (Lemma F) and its use toward boundary savings require adding the explicit tie-breaking rule described above. This addition is local and benign: it does not affect minimality inside good Q3\u2019s nor the bad-cube handling and preserves property (iii) by selecting a single geodesic.\n- Global integration: output.md states the ingredients (anchored mass, disagreement expansion, membership under disjointness, uniform boundary vertex) but stops short of a formal global inequality. The Proposition above fills this gap with a clean, rigorous bound and should be added.\n- Minor: Earlier drafts used the small-t expansion 1/2 \u2212 18T + O(T^2). The new inequality 1/2 \u2212 R(x) \u2265 2T is exact and uniform, simplifying the error bookkeeping.\n\nObstacles and limits\n\n- The anchored-driven gain disappears in the balanced-degree regime. To beat 3/8 unconditionally we must either: (i) show that in any worst-case coloring E_v[T_v] is bounded below (unlikely), or (ii) prove b \u2264 1/2 \u2212 \u03b3 in the balanced regime using local consistency across 4-cycles and Q3-types.\n- The LP/SDP program for b in the balanced regime remains the central challenge. It needs enumeration of Q3 classes with a marked vertex and their good/bad status and f1-start colors, plus 4-cycle consistency constraints.\n\nNext steps (concrete, auditable)\n\n1) Curate into output.md:\n   - Lemma (anchored disagreement \u2265 2T) with the y-parameter proof.\n   - Tie-breaking convention for f1 in anchored good Q3\u2019s (a short formal lemma).\n   - Proposition (global anchored-driven improvement): E[switches] \u2264 (1/3 + b/12 \u2212 (2/3)\u00b7E_v[\u03c4_v^2 T_v] + o(1))\u00b7n and the corollary with 1/24\u00b7E_v[T_v].\n2) Balanced-regime LP: proceed with the symmetric case r_v\u2261n/2; enumerate Q3 2-coloring classes with a marked vertex, tag good/bad and f1-start colors; encode 4-cycle consistency; maximize b. A numerical \u03b3>0 would guide an analytic proof.\n3) Optional strengthening: derive a complementary both-good refinement via u_v from Corollary D. Show that the both-good boundary switch probability \u2264 1/2 \u2212 (1/2)\u00b7E_v[u_v^2] + o(1) (properly weighted). This would give savings even in some balanced-degree instances if u_v has variance.\n\nNotes on verification\n\n- All ingredients used (Lemma B, Lemma E0, Lemma F, Proposition G) are already in output.md; the only new facts are the exact inequality 1/2 \u2212 R(x) \u2265 2T (with proof) and the tie-breaking convention.\n- The global bound follows by linearity of expectation and uniformity of boundary vertices; the o(1) term aggregates O(1/n) errors per boundary from Lemma E0 and negligible overlapping-pair contributions (as in Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s original argument).\n"
