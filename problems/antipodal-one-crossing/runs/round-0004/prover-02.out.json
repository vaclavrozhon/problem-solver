The ordered/unordered distinction does not affect the ratios we use (it cancels), but stating this explicitly where the boundary step is integrated would forestall confusion.\n- Missing integration: The refined both-good boundary contribution (anchored savings) is not yet written as a global inequality. With Proposition G and Lemma E0 now curated, we can add it rigorously. I provide a clean statement and proof below (Proposition J\u2019), together with a universal, exact anchored-drop inequality (Lemma I) that avoids asymptotics.\n\nNew lemmas (exact, checkable) \u2014 to add\n- Lemma I (Universal anchored-drop inequality).\n  \u2022 Statement. Let r be the red degree at a vertex v and set x:=r/n and t:=x\u22121/2. In Lemma F, the anchored\u2013anchored conditional disagreement probability equals\n    P_v[disagree | anchored] = 2x^3(1\u2212x)^3 / (x^3+(1\u2212x)^3)^2.\n    Then, for all x\u2208[0,1],\n    1/2 \u2212 P_v[disagree | anchored] \u2265 2 t^2 = 2 (r/n \u2212 1/2)^2.\n  \u2022 Proof. Write u:=t^2\u2208[0,1/4] and y:=4u\u2208[0,1]. Using the identities x(1\u2212x)=1/4\u2212u and x^3+(1\u2212x)^3=1/4+3u, we compute\n    P_v[disagree | anchored] = 2(1/4\u2212u)^3 / (1/4+3u)^2.\n    Hence the claimed inequality is equivalent to\n    2(1/4\u2212u)^3 \u2264 (1/2\u22122u)(1/4+3u)^2.\n    Multiplying out and scaling by 32, this becomes (1\u2212y)^3 \u2264 (1\u2212y)(1+3y)^2, i.e., (1\u2212y)^2 \u2264 (1+3y)^2, which is true for all y\u2208[0,1]. Equality holds at y=0 and y=1. \u220e\n  \u2022 Why useful: This gives an absolute quadratic drop from 1/2, uniform in n and without O(\u00b7) terms, and is tight at the extremes. It upgrades the asymptotic 18t^2 expansion to a rigorous inequality valid for all r.\n\n- Proposition J\u2019 (Global anchored savings in the boundary step).\n  \u2022 Setup. Use Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s scheme with k:=n/3 blocks and boundaries j=1,\u2026,k\u22121. Let Bj be the event that both neighboring Q3\u2019s at boundary j are good, and Aj the subevent that both are anchored at their shared vertex v_{3j}. Let \u03c4_v be as in Lemma B and T_v:=(r_v/n \u2212 1/2)^2.\n  \u2022 Claim. For either choice f\u2208{f1,f2} from Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s proof, the boundary-switch probability at boundary j satisfies\n    P[switch at boundary j] \u2264 b/2 + (a/2) \u2212 E[ 1_{Aj} \u00b7 (1/2 \u2212 P_v[disagree | anchored]) ] + o(1),\n    where the expectation averages over the random geodesic and the boundary index j, and v is the shared boundary vertex.\n    Consequently,\n    E[switches] \u2264 (1/3 + b/12)\u00b7n \u2212 (2/3)\u00b7E_v[ \u03c4_v^2\u00b7T_v ]\u00b7n + o(n).\n  \u2022 Proof. The baseline bound b/2 + (1/2)a + o(1) for P[switch at a boundary] is exactly Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s estimate, with the o(1) from excluding pairs sharing more than one vertex. On the subevent Aj, by Lemma I we have 1/2 \u2212 P_v[disagree | anchored] \u2265 2T_v; hence on Aj the both-good contribution drops by at least 2T_v. On B_j\u2216A_j (both good but not both anchored), we keep the crude 1/2 bound. Therefore\n    P[switch at boundary j] \u2264 b/2 + (a/2) \u2212 E[ 1_{Aj}\u00b7(1/2 \u2212 P_v[disagree | anchored]) ] + o(1).\n    By Proposition G, v=v_{3j} is uniform over V(Q_n), and by Lemma E0, P[Aj | v] = \u03c4_v^2 \u00b1 O(1/n). Combining with Lemma I and averaging over j gives\n    E[ 1_{Aj}\u00b7(1/2 \u2212 P_v[disagree | anchored]) ] \u2265 E_v[ \u03c4_v^2\u00b7(2T_v) ] \u2212 O(1/n).\n    Summing over the k\u22121\u2248n/3 boundaries yields the stated global inequality. \u220e\n  \u2022 Corollary (explicit unconditional gain in degree-unbalanced regime). Since \u03c4_v \u2265 1/4 \u2212 3/(4n) (Lemma B), we have \u03c4_v^2 \u2265 1/16 \u2212 O(1/n) uniformly. Hence\n    E[switches] \u2264 (1/3 + b/12 \u2212 (1/24 \u2212 o(1))\u00b7E_v[T_v])\u00b7n + o(n).\n    Thus any fixed lower bound on the mean-square degree imbalance E_v[T_v] yields a linear constant improvement over the (1/3 + b/12) baseline.\n\nWhy this is useful here\n- Lemma I eliminates the asymptotic expansion in Lemma F and gives a clean, exact inequality. Proposition J\u2019 completes the missing integration, showing precisely how anchored pairs reduce the both-good boundary contribution and quantifying the net effect.\n- The corollary isolates the \u201cbalanced-degree\u201d regime (E_v[T_v]\u22480) as the only obstruction; this sharpens the target for the b-optimization program (LP/SDP in the balanced case).\n\nExamples and sanity checks\n- Extremal balance r_v\u2261n/2: T_v\u22610 implies no anchored savings, recovering Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s baseline (1/3 + b/12 + o(1))\u00b7n.\n- Extremal bias r_v\u2208{0,n}: T_v=1/4, \u03c4_v=1, Lemma I gives 1/2 \u2212 P[disagree|anchored]=1/2. Proposition J\u2019 then yields E[switches] \u2264 (1/3 + b/12 \u2212 (2/3)\u00b7(1\u00b71/4))\u00b7n = (1/3 + b/12 \u2212 1/6)\u00b7n. This matches the intuition that fully monochromatic stars at every vertex allow very low boundary switch rates.\n\nIdeas toward the balanced regime (b \u2264 1/2 \u2212 \u03b3)\n- LP skeleton refinement (balanced r_v\u2261n/2):\n  \u2022 Variables: frequencies of the 4-cycle types at v; frequencies of marked-Q3 types (good/bad) with f1-start color at v; frequencies of disjoint marked-Q3 pairs at v with type-type combinations (subject to symmetry constraints).\n  \u2022 Constraints: marginalization to 1-edge and 4-cycle types; Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s Lemma 9 \u201cbadness filter\u201d at v and the opposite vertex of Q3; consistency across the four Q3\u2019s sharing a fixed 4-cycle through v.\n  \u2022 Objective: maximize b_v (good\u2013bad fraction among disjoint pairs). Investigate numerically whether the optimum is < 1/2 under these local consistency constraints.\n- Enumerative input: Enumerate 2-colorings of Q3 with a marked vertex up to Aut(Q3), tag good/bad, and, for good, record the f1-start color at the mark under a fixed tie-breaking.\n\nObstacles and notes\n- Weighting: The boundary contribution is a weighted average over shared vertices; Proposition G addresses this by uniformizing v_{3j}. The only residual error is the O(1/n) from disjointness conditioning (Lemma E0), absorbed in o(1).\n- Ordered vs unordered pairs: Our anchored calculations use ordered counts (Lemma F) but the translation to probabilities and to boundary events is invariant under order, so the distinction does not affect the inequalities; stating this explicitly in output.md would help.\n- LP scale: Encoding joint constraints for disjoint marked-Q3 pairs may grow rapidly; symmetry reductions (balanced case, color-swap, coordinate permutations) will be crucial.\n\nNext steps (auditable)\n1) Add Lemma I and Proposition J\u2019 (with proof) to output.md. This will complete the anchored-based refinement rigorously and yield the corollary with the explicit (1/24)\u00b7E_v[T_v] improvement.\n2) Q3 pattern enumeration with a marked vertex: list isomorphism classes, classify good/bad, and, for good, record f1-start color at the mark. This feeds the LP in the balanced regime.\n3) Build the first LP relaxation in the symmetric (balanced) case and solve numerically to test if b \u2264 1/2 \u2212 \u03b3 (\u03b3>0) follows from 4-cycle and badness constraints.\n4) Optional sharpening: Using Lemma F\u2019s exact formula, one can improve the constant 2 in Lemma I for small |t| (the Taylor coefficient is 18). Prove a global bound of the form 1/2 \u2212 P_v[disagree|anchored] \u2265 c\u00b7T_v with c>2 (e.g., c=3) valid for all t; this would slightly strengthen the anchored gain constant beyond 1/24 without relying on small-t asymptotics."
