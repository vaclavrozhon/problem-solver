The ordered/unordered distinction does not affect the ratios we use (it cancels), but stating this explicitly where the boundary step is integrated would forestall confusion.\\n- Missing integration: The refined both-good boundary contribution (anchored savings) is not yet written as a global inequality. With Proposition G and Lemma E0 now curated, we can add it rigorously. I provide a clean statement and proof below (Proposition J’), together with a universal, exact anchored-drop inequality (Lemma I) that avoids asymptotics.\\n\\nNew lemmas (exact, checkable) — to add\\n- Lemma I (Universal anchored-drop inequality).\\n  • Statement. Let r be the red degree at a vertex v and set x:=r/n and t:=x−1/2. In Lemma F, the anchored–anchored conditional disagreement probability equals\\n    P_v[disagree | anchored] = 2x^3(1−x)^3 / (x^3+(1−x)^3)^2.\\n    Then, for all x∈[0,1],\\n    1/2 − P_v[disagree | anchored] ≥ 2 t^2 = 2 (r/n − 1/2)^2.\\n  • Proof. Write u:=t^2∈[0,1/4] and y:=4u∈[0,1]. Using the identities x(1−x)=1/4−u and x^3+(1−x)^3=1/4+3u, we compute\\n    P_v[disagree | anchored] = 2(1/4−u)^3 / (1/4+3u)^2.\\n    Hence the claimed inequality is equivalent to\\n    2(1/4−u)^3 ≤ (1/2−2u)(1/4+3u)^2.\\n    Multiplying out and scaling by 32, this becomes (1−y)^3 ≤ (1−y)(1+3y)^2, i.e., (1−y)^2 ≤ (1+3y)^2, which is true for all y∈[0,1]. Equality holds at y=0 and y=1. ∎\\n  • Why useful: This gives an absolute quadratic drop from 1/2, uniform in n and without O(·) terms, and is tight at the extremes. It upgrades the asymptotic 18t^2 expansion to a rigorous inequality valid for all r.\\n\\n- Proposition J’ (Global anchored savings in the boundary step).\\n  • Setup. Use Dvořák’s scheme with k:=n/3 blocks and boundaries j=1,…,k−1. Let Bj be the event that both neighboring Q3’s at boundary j are good, and Aj the subevent that both are anchored at their shared vertex v_{3j}. Let τ_v be as in Lemma B and T_v:=(r_v/n − 1/2)^2.\\n  • Claim. For either choice f∈{f1,f2} from Dvořák’s proof, the boundary-switch probability at boundary j satisfies\\n    P[switch at boundary j] ≤ b/2 + (a/2) − E[ 1_{Aj} · (1/2 − P_v[disagree | anchored]) ] + o(1),\\n    where the expectation averages over the random geodesic and the boundary index j, and v is the shared boundary vertex.\\n    Consequently,\\n    E[switches] ≤ (1/3 + b/12)·n − (2/3)·E_v[ τ_v^2·T_v ]·n + o(n).\\n  • Proof. The baseline bound b/2 + (1/2)a + o(1) for P[switch at a boundary] is exactly Dvořák’s estimate, with the o(1) from excluding pairs sharing more than one vertex. On the subevent Aj, by Lemma I we have 1/2 − P_v[disagree | anchored] ≥ 2T_v; hence on Aj the both-good contribution drops by at least 2T_v. On B_j∖A_j (both good but not both anchored), we keep the crude 1/2 bound. Therefore\\n    P[switch at boundary j] ≤ b/2 + (a/2) − E[ 1_{Aj}·(1/2 − P_v[disagree | anchored]) ] + o(1).\\n    By Proposition G, v=v_{3j} is uniform over V(Q_n), and by Lemma E0, P[Aj | v] = τ_v^2 ± O(1/n). Combining with Lemma I and averaging over j gives\\n    E[ 1_{Aj}·(1/2 − P_v[disagree | anchored]) ] ≥ E_v[ τ_v^2·(2T_v) ] − O(1/n).\\n    Summing over the k−1≈n/3 boundaries yields the stated global inequality. ∎\\n  • Corollary (explicit unconditional gain in degree-unbalanced regime). Since τ_v ≥ 1/4 − 3/(4n) (Lemma B), we have τ_v^2 ≥ 1/16 − O(1/n) uniformly. Hence\\n    E[switches] ≤ (1/3 + b/12 − (1/24 − o(1))·E_v[T_v])·n + o(n).\\n    Thus any fixed lower bound on the mean-square degree imbalance E_v[T_v] yields a linear constant improvement over the (1/3 + b/12) baseline.\\n\\nWhy this is useful here\\n- Lemma I eliminates the asymptotic expansion in Lemma F and gives a clean, exact inequality. Proposition J’ completes the missing integration, showing precisely how anchored pairs reduce the both-good boundary contribution and quantifying the net effect.\\n- The corollary isolates the “balanced-degree” regime (E_v[T_v]≈0) as the only obstruction; this sharpens the target for the b-optimization program (LP/SDP in the balanced case).\\n\\nExamples and sanity checks\\n- Extremal balance r_v≡n/2: T_v≡0 implies no anchored savings, recovering Dvořák’s baseline (1/3 + b/12 + o(1))·n.\\n- Extremal bias r_v∈{0,n}: T_v=1/4, τ_v=1, Lemma I gives 1/2 − P[disagree|anchored]=1/2. Proposition J’ then yields E[switches] ≤ (1/3 + b/12 − (2/3)·(1·1/4))·n = (1/3 + b/12 − 1/6)·n. This matches the intuition that fully monochromatic stars at every vertex allow very low boundary switch rates.\\n\\nIdeas toward the balanced regime (b ≤ 1/2 − γ)\\n- LP skeleton refinement (balanced r_v≡n/2):\\n  • Variables: frequencies of the 4-cycle types at v; frequencies of marked-Q3 types (good/bad) with f1-start color at v; frequencies of disjoint marked-Q3 pairs at v with type-type combinations (subject to symmetry constraints).\\n  • Constraints: marginalization to 1-edge and 4-cycle types; Dvořák’s Lemma 9 “badness filter” at v and the opposite vertex of Q3; consistency across the four Q3’s sharing a fixed 4-cycle through v.\\n  • Objective: maximize b_v (good–bad fraction among disjoint pairs). Investigate numerically whether the optimum is < 1/2 under these local consistency constraints.\\n- Enumerative input: Enumerate 2-colorings of Q3 with a marked vertex up to Aut(Q3), tag good/bad, and, for good, record the f1-start color at the mark under a fixed tie-breaking.\\n\\nObstacles and notes\\n- Weighting: The boundary contribution is a weighted average over shared vertices; Proposition G addresses this by uniformizing v_{3j}. The only residual error is the O(1/n) from disjointness conditioning (Lemma E0), absorbed in o(1).\\n- Ordered vs unordered pairs: Our anchored calculations use ordered counts (Lemma F) but the translation to probabilities and to boundary events is invariant under order, so the distinction does not affect the inequalities; stating this explicitly in output.md would help.\\n- LP scale: Encoding joint constraints for disjoint marked-Q3 pairs may grow rapidly; symmetry reductions (balanced case, color-swap, coordinate permutations) will be crucial.\\n\\nNext steps (auditable)\\n1) Add Lemma I and Proposition J’ (with proof) to output.md. This will complete the anchored-based refinement rigorously and yield the corollary with the explicit (1/24)·E_v[T_v] improvement.\\n2) Q3 pattern enumeration with a marked vertex: list isomorphism classes, classify good/bad, and, for good, record f1-start color at the mark. This feeds the LP in the balanced regime.\\n3) Build the first LP relaxation in the symmetric (balanced) case and solve numerically to test if b ≤ 1/2 − γ (γ>0) follows from 4-cycle and badness constraints.\\n4) Optional sharpening: Using Lemma F’s exact formula, one can improve the constant 2 in Lemma I for small |t| (the Taylor coefficient is 18). Prove a global bound of the form 1/2 − P_v[disagree|anchored] ≥ c·T_v with c>2 (e.g., c=3) valid for all t; this would slightly strengthen the anchored gain constant beyond 1/24 without relying on small-t asymptotics.\"}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"auto","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"ProverOutput","schema_":{"properties":{"progress_md":{"description":"Append-only progress notes","title":"Progress Md","type":"string"}},"required":["progress_md"],"title":"ProverOutput","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":39479,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":9182,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":6912},"total_tokens":48661},"user":null,"store":true}
