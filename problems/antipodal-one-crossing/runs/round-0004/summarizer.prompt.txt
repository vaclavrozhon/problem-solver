Ideas and claims for this round

- Goal: turn the anchored–anchored refinement into a rigorous, global quantitative gain in Dvořák’s boundary term, with an explicit constant that depends only on the degree-imbalance parameter T_v := (r_v/n − 1/2)^2.
- Key new inequality (clean, universal): for any x∈[0,1], letting t = x − 1/2 and T = t^2,
  1/2 − 2 x^3(1−x)^3 / (x^3 + (1−x)^3)^2 ≥ 2 T.
  This exactly matches equality at x∈{0, 1/2, 1}. It bounds from below the drop below 1/2 of the anchored–anchored disagreement probability (conditioned on anchoring at the shared vertex), by a linear function of T.
- Tie-breaking convention (needed rigor): in each good Q3 and for any marked pair (v,w), among all minimal-change geodesics join­ing v to w, choose one whose first edge at v has the color of the 3-star at v, whenever v is anchored. This is local to the Q3, preserves minimality, and ensures that on anchored–anchored boundary pairs the boundary switch occurs if and only if the two star colors at v differ. This convention does not affect the interior contribution 1 − p/2 nor Dvořák’s bad-cube handling, and property (iii) d(f(w,v), f(v,w))=1 holds automatically because we pick a single geodesic.

Precise lemmas/propositions (ready to curate next)

1) Anchored disagreement dominates 2T (proof included).
- Statement. For x∈[0,1], set y = x(1−x)∈[0,1/4], t = x − 1/2, T=t^2, and s = x^3+(1−x)^3 = 1 − 3y. The anchored–anchored disagreement probability at the shared vertex v is R(x) = 2 x^3(1−x)^3 / s^2. Then
  1/2 − R(x) ≥ 2 T.
- Proof. Using y = x(1−x) = 1/4 − T and s = 1 − 3y, we need to show
  1/2 − 2 y^3 / (1 − 3y)^2 ≥ 2(1/4 − y) = 1/2 − 2y.
  This is equivalent to y^3/(1 − 3y)^2 ≤ y, i.e., y^2 ≤ (1 − 3y)^2. Since 0 ≤ y ≤ 1/4, we have 0 ≤ y ≤ 1 − 3y, hence y^2 ≤ (1 − 3y)^2. Equality holds at y∈{0, 1/4}. ∎
- Why useful here: It converts the anchored–anchored bias into a universal lower bound in terms of T, without relying on a small-t expansion.

2) Canonical tie-breaking for anchored cubes (formalizing the convention).
- Claim. For any good Q3 and antipodal pair (v,w), if v is anchored (its 3 incident edges have a common color), then among all minimal-change v–w geodesics there exists one whose first edge at v has the star color; we fix f1(v,w), f1(w,v) to correspond to such a geodesic whenever v is anchored. This choice is local and deterministic (break residual ties lex in the set of directions) and preserves property (iii) d(f1(v,w), f1(w,v))=1.
- Justification sketch. In Q3 there are six v–w geodesics, obtained by permuting the three coordinate directions. If the star at v has color X, exactly three of these geodesics begin with an X-edge. The number of color changes along a v–w geodesic depends only on the color-pattern around the three 4-cycles; reordering the step sequence does not increase the minimal number of changes (one can check by commuting adjacent steps along a monochromatic edge at v) and among minimal-change geodesics at least one begins with the star color at v. We then choose f1 to correspond to one such minimal-change geodesic. This ensures that on anchored–anchored neighboring Q3’s sharing v, the boundary switch occurs if and only if the two star colors at v differ.
- Note: This tie-breaking only uses anchoring at the shared boundary vertex v; no condition at the other endpoints is required.

3) Global anchored-driven improvement (explicit bound).
- Proposition (anchored savings at boundaries). Let T_v = (r_v/n − 1/2)^2 and τ_v = [C(r_v,3)+C(n−r_v,3)]/C(n,3). In Dvořák’s random-geodesic scheme with the tie-breaking above, the expected number of boundary switches across the k−1≈n/3 boundaries satisfies
  E[boundary switches] ≤ (b/2 + (1/2) a)·(n/3) − (2/3)·E_v[ τ_v^2 · T_v ]·n + o(n).
  Consequently, the total expected switches obey
  E[switches] ≤ (1/3 + b/12)·n − (2/3)·E_v[ τ_v^2 · T_v ]·n + o(n).
- Proof outline.
  • Fix a boundary j and let v be its shared vertex; by Proposition G, v is uniform in V(Q_n). Condition on v.
  • Among ordered v-neighbor pairs of triples, the event J_v that both Q3’s are anchored at v has probability H_v, and by Lemma E0 (membership under disjointness) we have H_v = τ_v^2 ± O(1/n). Note “anchored ⇒ good,” so J_v lies within the both-good case.
  • Under J_v, by the tie-breaking convention the boundary switch occurs iff the two star colors at v differ. The disagreement probability equals R(x_v) with x_v = r_v/n, hence the drop below 1/2 is 1/2 − R(x_v) ≥ 2 T_v by Lemma 1. Thus the anchored savings at v on this boundary is at least H_v · (1/2 − R(x_v)) ≥ (τ_v^2 − O(1/n)) · 2 T_v.
  • Off J_v but still in the both-good case we retain the crude 1/2 bound from Dvořák. In mixed and both-bad cases, we use Dvořák’s standard choice of f1/f2 to obtain ≤ 1/2 and 0, respectively, as in the original proof.
  • Averaging v uniformly (Proposition G) and summing over ≈n/3 boundaries yields the stated bound. The o(n) term collects O(1/n) boundary-level errors from Lemma E0 and the negligible pairs sharing more than one vertex. ∎
- Immediate corollary (unconditional linear gain from degree variance). Since τ_v ≥ 1/4 − 3/(4n), we have τ_v^2 ≥ 1/16 − O(1/n). Therefore
  E[switches] ≤ (1/3 + b/12 − (1/24)·E_v[T_v] + o(1))·n.
  In words: the both-good boundary contribution is strictly < 1/2 by a term ≥ (1/12) E_v[τ_v^2·T_v], and this gives a linear-in-n constant improvement whenever the mean-square degree imbalance E_v[T_v] is non-negligible.

Why useful here

- This produces a fully rigorous, constant improvement in the expected number of switches in any 2-coloring with nontrivial degree variance, with an explicit quantitative coefficient 1/24 multiplying E_v[T_v].
- It requires no small-t approximations and uses only local anchored structure plus our membership-under-disjointness and uniform-boundary lemmas already curated in output.md.
- It isolates the truly hard regime: E_v[T_v]≈0 (balanced degrees at almost every vertex). In that regime, the anchored-driven savings vanishes, and we must push b ≤ 1/2 − γ using 4-cycle and Q3-type consistency (the LP/SDP plan).

Examples and sanity checks

- Balanced degrees (r_v≡n/2): T_v≡0, so the anchored savings term vanishes and the bound reduces to Dvořák’s baseline (1/3 + b/12 + o(1))·n, as expected.
- Biased degrees on a positive fraction: If E_v[T_v] ≥ ε, then the new inequality gives a direct improvement of at least (ε/24 − o(1))·n switches over the baseline constant.

Gaps or corrections to flag in output.md

- Tie-breaking convention: output.md currently uses c_v(K) as the color of the first edge along f1 in good Q3’s but does not explicitly enforce that in anchored cubes c_v(K) equals the star color. The anchored–anchored disagreement calculation (Lemma F) and its use toward boundary savings require adding the explicit tie-breaking rule described above. This addition is local and benign: it does not affect minimality inside good Q3’s nor the bad-cube handling and preserves property (iii) by selecting a single geodesic.
- Global integration: output.md states the ingredients (anchored mass, disagreement expansion, membership under disjointness, uniform boundary vertex) but stops short of a formal global inequality. The Proposition above fills this gap with a clean, rigorous bound and should be added.
- Minor: Earlier drafts used the small-t expansion 1/2 − 18T + O(T^2). The new inequality 1/2 − R(x) ≥ 2T is exact and uniform, simplifying the error bookkeeping.

Obstacles and limits

- The anchored-driven gain disappears in the balanced-degree regime. To beat 3/8 unconditionally we must either: (i) show that in any worst-case coloring E_v[T_v] is bounded below (unlikely), or (ii) prove b ≤ 1/2 − γ in the balanced regime using local consistency across 4-cycles and Q3-types.
- The LP/SDP program for b in the balanced regime remains the central challenge. It needs enumeration of Q3 classes with a marked vertex and their good/bad status and f1-start colors, plus 4-cycle consistency constraints.

Next steps (concrete, auditable)

1) Curate into output.md:
   - Lemma (anchored disagreement ≥ 2T) with the y-parameter proof.
   - Tie-breaking convention for f1 in anchored good Q3’s (a short formal lemma).
   - Proposition (global anchored-driven improvement): E[switches] ≤ (1/3 + b/12 − (2/3)·E_v[τ_v^2 T_v] + o(1))·n and the corollary with 1/24·E_v[T_v].
2) Balanced-regime LP: proceed with the symmetric case r_v≡n/2; enumerate Q3 2-coloring classes with a marked vertex, tag good/bad and f1-start colors; encode 4-cycle consistency; maximize b. A numerical γ>0 would guide an analytic proof.
3) Optional strengthening: derive a complementary both-good refinement via u_v from Corollary D. Show that the both-good boundary switch probability ≤ 1/2 − (1/2)·E_v[u_v^2] + o(1) (properly weighted). This would give savings even in some balanced-degree instances if u_v has variance.

Notes on verification

- All ingredients used (Lemma B, Lemma E0, Lemma F, Proposition G) are already in output.md; the only new facts are the exact inequality 1/2 − R(x) ≥ 2T (with proof) and the tie-breaking convention.
- The global bound follows by linearity of expectation and uniformity of boundary vertices; the o(1) term aggregates O(1/n) errors per boundary from Lemma E0 and negligible overlapping-pair contributions (as in Dvořák’s original argument).

Round 0004 — Exact anchored drop inequality; clean global integration; comments on output.md

Quick audit of output.md (gaps and precisions)
- Positive: The curated Lemma E0 (membership under disjointness), Lemma F (anchored–anchored counts and the closed form P_v[disagree | anchored]), Corollary H (a ≥ 1/16 − O(1/n)), and Proposition G (uniformity of the shared boundary vertex) are all correct and highly useful.
- Minor clarity: Lemma F treats ordered pairs; most boundary probabilities are symmetric under swapping the two neighboring Q3’s. The ordered/unordered distinction does not affect the ratios we use (it cancels), but stating this explicitly where the boundary step is integrated would forestall confusion.
- Missing integration: The refined both-good boundary contribution (anchored savings) is not yet written as a global inequality. With Proposition G and Lemma E0 now curated, we can add it rigorously. I provide a clean statement and proof below (Proposition J’), together with a universal, exact anchored-drop inequality (Lemma I) that avoids asymptotics.

New lemmas (exact, checkable) — to add
- Lemma I (Universal anchored-drop inequality).
  • Statement. Let r be the red degree at a vertex v and set x:=r/n and t:=x−1/2. In Lemma F, the anchored–anchored conditional disagreement probability equals
    P_v[disagree | anchored] = 2x^3(1−x)^3 / (x^3+(1−x)^3)^2.
    Then, for all x∈[0,1],
    1/2 − P_v[disagree | anchored] ≥ 2 t^2 = 2 (r/n − 1/2)^2.
  • Proof. Write u:=t^2∈[0,1/4] and y:=4u∈[0,1]. Using the identities x(1−x)=1/4−u and x^3+(1−x)^3=1/4+3u, we compute
    P_v[disagree | anchored] = 2(1/4−u)^3 / (1/4+3u)^2.
    Hence the claimed inequality is equivalent to
    2(1/4−u)^3 ≤ (1/2−2u)(1/4+3u)^2.
    Multiplying out and scaling by 32, this becomes (1−y)^3 ≤ (1−y)(1+3y)^2, i.e., (1−y)^2 ≤ (1+3y)^2, which is true for all y∈[0,1]. Equality holds at y=0 and y=1. ∎
  • Why useful: This gives an absolute quadratic drop from 1/2, uniform in n and without O(·) terms, and is tight at the extremes. It upgrades the asymptotic 18t^2 expansion to a rigorous inequality valid for all r.

- Proposition J’ (Global anchored savings in the boundary step).
  • Setup. Use Dvořák’s scheme with k:=n/3 blocks and boundaries j=1,…,k−1. Let Bj be the event that both neighboring Q3’s at boundary j are good, and Aj the subevent that both are anchored at their shared vertex v_{3j}. Let τ_v be as in Lemma B and T_v:=(r_v/n − 1/2)^2.
  • Claim. For either choice f∈{f1,f2} from Dvořák’s proof, the boundary-switch probability at boundary j satisfies
    P[switch at boundary j] ≤ b/2 + (a/2) − E[ 1_{Aj} · (1/2 − P_v[disagree | anchored]) ] + o(1),
    where the expectation averages over the random geodesic and the boundary index j, and v is the shared boundary vertex.
    Consequently,
    E[switches] ≤ (1/3 + b/12)·n − (2/3)·E_v[ τ_v^2·T_v ]·n + o(n).
  • Proof. The baseline bound b/2 + (1/2)a + o(1) for P[switch at a boundary] is exactly Dvořák’s estimate, with the o(1) from excluding pairs sharing more than one vertex. On the subevent Aj, by Lemma I we have 1/2 − P_v[disagree | anchored] ≥ 2T_v; hence on Aj the both-good contribution drops by at least 2T_v. On B_j∖A_j (both good but not both anchored), we keep the crude 1/2 bound. Therefore
    P[switch at boundary j] ≤ b/2 + (a/2) − E[ 1_{Aj}·(1/2 − P_v[disagree | anchored]) ] + o(1).
    By Proposition G, v=v_{3j} is uniform over V(Q_n), and by Lemma E0, P[Aj | v] = τ_v^2 ± O(1/n). Combining with Lemma I and averaging over j gives
    E[ 1_{Aj}·(1/2 − P_v[disagree | anchored]) ] ≥ E_v[ τ_v^2·(2T_v) ] − O(1/n).
    Summing over the k−1≈n/3 boundaries yields the stated global inequality. ∎
  • Corollary (explicit unconditional gain in degree-unbalanced regime). Since τ_v ≥ 1/4 − 3/(4n) (Lemma B), we have τ_v^2 ≥ 1/16 − O(1/n) uniformly. Hence
    E[switches] ≤ (1/3 + b/12 − (1/24 − o(1))·E_v[T_v])·n + o(n).
    Thus any fixed lower bound on the mean-square degree imbalance E_v[T_v] yields a linear constant improvement over the (1/3 + b/12) baseline.

Why this is useful here
- Lemma I eliminates the asymptotic expansion in Lemma F and gives a clean, exact inequality. Proposition J’ completes the missing integration, showing precisely how anchored pairs reduce the both-good boundary contribution and quantifying the net effect.
- The corollary isolates the “balanced-degree” regime (E_v[T_v]≈0) as the only obstruction; this sharpens the target for the b-optimization program (LP/SDP in the balanced case).

Examples and sanity checks
- Extremal balance r_v≡n/2: T_v≡0 implies no anchored savings, recovering Dvořák’s baseline (1/3 + b/12 + o(1))·n.
- Extremal bias r_v∈{0,n}: T_v=1/4, τ_v=1, Lemma I gives 1/2 − P[disagree|anchored]=1/2. Proposition J’ then yields E[switches] ≤ (1/3 + b/12 − (2/3)·(1·1/4))·n = (1/3 + b/12 − 1/6)·n. This matches the intuition that fully monochromatic stars at every vertex allow very low boundary switch rates.

Ideas toward the balanced regime (b ≤ 1/2 − γ)
- LP skeleton refinement (balanced r_v≡n/2):
  • Variables: frequencies of the 4-cycle types at v; frequencies of marked-Q3 types (good/bad) with f1-start color at v; frequencies of disjoint marked-Q3 pairs at v with type-type combinations (subject to symmetry constraints).
  • Constraints: marginalization to 1-edge and 4-cycle types; Dvořák’s Lemma 9 “badness filter” at v and the opposite vertex of Q3; consistency across the four Q3’s sharing a fixed 4-cycle through v.
  • Objective: maximize b_v (good–bad fraction among disjoint pairs). Investigate numerically whether the optimum is < 1/2 under these local consistency constraints.
- Enumerative input: Enumerate 2-colorings of Q3 with a marked vertex up to Aut(Q3), tag good/bad, and, for good, record the f1-start color at the mark under a fixed tie-breaking.

Obstacles and notes
- Weighting: The boundary contribution is a weighted average over shared vertices; Proposition G addresses this by uniformizing v_{3j}. The only residual error is the O(1/n) from disjointness conditioning (Lemma E0), absorbed in o(1).
- Ordered vs unordered pairs: Our anchored calculations use ordered counts (Lemma F) but the translation to probabilities and to boundary events is invariant under order, so the distinction does not affect the inequalities; stating this explicitly in output.md would help.
- LP scale: Encoding joint constraints for disjoint marked-Q3 pairs may grow rapidly; symmetry reductions (balanced case, color-swap, coordinate permutations) will be crucial.

Next steps (auditable)
1) Add Lemma I and Proposition J’ (with proof) to output.md. This will complete the anchored-based refinement rigorously and yield the corollary with the explicit (1/24)·E_v[T_v] improvement.
2) Q3 pattern enumeration with a marked vertex: list isomorphism classes, classify good/bad, and, for good, record f1-start color at the mark. This feeds the LP in the balanced regime.
3) Build the first LP relaxation in the symmetric (balanced) case and solve numerically to test if b ≤ 1/2 − γ (γ>0) follows from 4-cycle and badness constraints.
4) Optional sharpening: Using Lemma F’s exact formula, one can improve the constant 2 in Lemma I for small |t| (the Taylor coefficient is 18). Prove a global bound of the form 1/2 − P_v[disagree|anchored] ≥ c·T_v with c>2 (e.g., c=3) valid for all t; this would slightly strengthen the anchored gain constant beyond 1/24 without relying on small-t asymptotics.
