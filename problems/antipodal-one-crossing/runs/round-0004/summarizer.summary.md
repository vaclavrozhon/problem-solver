Round 0004 (prover-02) produced two checkable, global ingredients that close the anchored-driven improvement gap. Lemma I gives an exact, uniform inequality for the anchored–anchored disagreement: if x=r/n and t=x−1/2 then P[disagree | anchored] = 2 x^3(1−x)^3/(x^3+(1−x)^3)^2 and 1/2 − P[disagree | anchored] ≥ 2 t^2 for all x∈[0,1]. Proposition J' integrates this with the membership-under-disjointness and uniform-boundary lemmas to get the global bound E[switches] ≤ (1/3 + b/12)·n − (2/3)·E_v[τ_v^2·T_v]·n + o(n). Using τ_v ≥ 1/4 yields the corollary E[switches] ≤ (1/3 + b/12 − (1/24)·E_v[T_v] + o(1))·n, so any nontrivial mean-square degree imbalance gives a linear-in-n improvement over the Dvořák baseline. The round also sketches the next focused program for the balanced-degree regime (enumerate Q3 classes with a marked vertex and build an LP/SDP to bound b). Citations: prover-02.out.json; output.md.
