Overall, both reports make substantial, coherent progress on the anchored–anchored refinement of the both‑good boundary term, and they slot cleanly into the framework already curated in output.md (Lemmas E0, F, Proposition G). The key algebraic inequality 1/2 − R(x) ≥ 2T (where R(x)=2x^3(1−x)^3/(x^3+(1−x)^3)^2 and T=(x−1/2)^2) is correct, sharp at x∈{0,1/2,1}, and removes the need for small‑t expansions. The proposed global integration (subtracting the anchored savings from the both‑good boundary contribution) is also sound and, after averaging the shared boundary vertex using Proposition G and using Lemma E0 to handle the disjointness conditioning, yields a rigorous improvement of order (2/3)·E_v[τ_v^2 T_v]·n, and hence the simple corollary with constant 1/24 multiplying E_v[T_v].

Two points to correct/clarify:
- Tie‑breaking is not needed for the anchored‑anchored boundary refinement. In a boundary between consecutive blocks, the last edge of the first Q3 at v and the first edge of the next Q3 at v are both among the three edges of the respective cubes incident to v. If both cubes are anchored at v, those three edges are monochromatic in each cube, so the boundary switch occurs if and only if the two star colors at v differ, irrespective of how the minimal‑change geodesic is chosen inside each cube. The anchored disagreement probability used at the boundary therefore depends only on star colors and is exactly the ratio already computed in Lemma F.
- The suggestion to prove a uniform improvement 1/2 − R(x) ≥ c·T with c>2 “for all t” is false. Since T=1/4 at x∈{0,1}, the left side equals 1/2 there, so any c>2 would force 1/2 ≥ c/4 > 1/2. Thus the best uniform constant is c=2, which is attained at the endpoints and at balance. One can get larger coefficients only on restricted ranges of |t| (local inequalities), not uniformly.

On bookkeeping: the ordered/unordered distinction for disjoint pairs is harmless here because the anchored disagreement probability is a ratio symmetric in the two cubes; still, it’s good to note explicitly that the conditional law at a boundary is the uniform law on ordered disjoint pairs, and conditioning on both being anchored then yields the uniform law over ordered anchored–anchored pairs.

I recommend adding two items to output.md: (i) the exact anchored‑drop inequality (with a one‑line proof), and (ii) the global anchored‑savings proposition with the stated corollary. These are rigorous, self‑contained, and build directly on the already‑curated ingredients. This constitutes a concrete, publication‑grade step.

Next steps:
- Balanced‑degree regime: push b ≤ 1/2 − γ via an LP/SDP using marked‑Q3 types at a vertex (with f1‑start color), 4‑cycle consistency, and Dvořák’s badness constraints. Begin by enumerating isomorphism classes of 2‑colorings of Q3 with a marked vertex, classify good/bad, and, for good, record the f1‑start color at the mark.
- Complementary refinement using u_v: leverage Corollary D to bound the both‑good boundary switch probability by 1/2 − (1/2)·E_v[u_v^2], with proper weighting by the both‑good mass at v (handled via Lemma E0). This may yield savings even when E_v[T_v]≈0.
- Optional but safe sharpening: use the exact formula to tabulate 1/2 − R(x) versus T numerically, to derive piecewise lower bounds with c>2 on small |t| intervals (not uniform), which could improve constants in some regimes.
