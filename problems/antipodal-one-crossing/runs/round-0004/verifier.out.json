  "feedback_md": "Overall, both reports make substantial, coherent progress on the anchored\u2013anchored refinement of the both\u2011good boundary term, and they slot cleanly into the framework already curated in output.md (Lemmas E0, F, Proposition G). The key algebraic inequality 1/2 \u2212 R(x) \u2265 2T (where R(x)=2x^3(1\u2212x)^3/(x^3+(1\u2212x)^3)^2 and T=(x\u22121/2)^2) is correct, sharp at x\u2208{0,1/2,1}, and removes the need for small\u2011t expansions. The proposed global integration (subtracting the anchored savings from the both\u2011good boundary contribution) is also sound and, after averaging the shared boundary vertex using Proposition G and using Lemma E0 to handle the disjointness conditioning, yields a rigorous improvement of order (2/3)\u00b7E_v[\u03c4_v^2 T_v]\u00b7n, and hence the simple corollary with constant 1/24 multiplying E_v[T_v].\n\nTwo points to correct/clarify:\n- Tie\u2011breaking is not needed for the anchored\u2011anchored boundary refinement. In a boundary between consecutive blocks, the last edge of the first Q3 at v and the first edge of the next Q3 at v are both among the three edges of the respective cubes incident to v. If both cubes are anchored at v, those three edges are monochromatic in each cube, so the boundary switch occurs if and only if the two star colors at v differ, irrespective of how the minimal\u2011change geodesic is chosen inside each cube. The anchored disagreement probability used at the boundary therefore depends only on star colors and is exactly the ratio already computed in Lemma F.\n- The suggestion to prove a uniform improvement 1/2 \u2212 R(x) \u2265 c\u00b7T with c>2 \u201cfor all t\u201d is false. Since T=1/4 at x\u2208{0,1}, the left side equals 1/2 there, so any c>2 would force 1/2 \u2265 c/4 > 1/2. Thus the best uniform constant is c=2, which is attained at the endpoints and at balance. One can get larger coefficients only on restricted ranges of |t| (local inequalities), not uniformly.\n\nOn bookkeeping: the ordered/unordered distinction for disjoint pairs is harmless here because the anchored disagreement probability is a ratio symmetric in the two cubes; still, it\u2019s good to note explicitly that the conditional law at a boundary is the uniform law on ordered disjoint pairs, and conditioning on both being anchored then yields the uniform law over ordered anchored\u2013anchored pairs.\n\nI recommend adding two items to output.md: (i) the exact anchored\u2011drop inequality (with a one\u2011line proof), and (ii) the global anchored\u2011savings proposition with the stated corollary. These are rigorous, self\u2011contained, and build directly on the already\u2011curated ingredients. This constitutes a concrete, publication\u2011grade step.\n\nNext steps:\n- Balanced\u2011degree regime: push b \u2264 1/2 \u2212 \u03b3 via an LP/SDP using marked\u2011Q3 types at a vertex (with f1\u2011start color), 4\u2011cycle consistency, and Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s badness constraints. Begin by enumerating isomorphism classes of 2\u2011colorings of Q3 with a marked vertex, classify good/bad, and, for good, record the f1\u2011start color at the mark.\n- Complementary refinement using u_v: leverage Corollary D to bound the both\u2011good boundary switch probability by 1/2 \u2212 (1/2)\u00b7E_v[u_v^2], with proper weighting by the both\u2011good mass at v (handled via Lemma E0). This may yield savings even when E_v[T_v]\u22480.\n- Optional but safe sharpening: use the exact formula to tabulate 1/2 \u2212 R(x) versus T numerically, to derive piecewise lower bounds with c>2 on small |t| intervals (not uniform), which could improve constants in some regimes.\n",
  "new_notes_md": "Anchored\u2013anchored refinement: exact drop and global integration\n- Notation recap at a vertex v:\n  \u2022 r_v = red degree; x_v := r_v/n; T_v := (x_v \u2212 1/2)^2.\n  \u2022 \u03c4_v := [C(r_v,3)+C(n\u2212r_v,3)]/C(n,3), the fraction of 3\u2011sets anchored at v (monochromatic star at v). By Lemma B, \u03c4_v \u2265 1/4 \u2212 3/(4n).\n  \u2022 For anchored\u2013anchored pairs at v, Lemma F gives the exact conditional disagreement probability R(x) = 2x^3(1\u2212x)^3/(x^3+(1\u2212x)^3)^2 with x=x_v.\n\n- Exact universal inequality (anchored drop): for all x\u2208[0,1], letting y:=x(1\u2212x) and T:=(x\u22121/2)^2=1/4\u2212y,\n  1/2 \u2212 R(x) = 1/2 \u2212 2y^3/(1\u22123y)^2 \u2265 2T.\n  Proof sketch: The inequality is equivalent to y^2 \u2264 (1\u22123y)^2 for y\u2208[0,1/4], which holds with equality at y\u2208{0,1/4} (i.e., x\u2208{0,1/2,1}). Thus the drop below 1/2 is at least 2T, uniformly and sharply.\n\n- Boundary interpretation without extra tie\u2011breaking: At a boundary vertex v between consecutive blocks, the last edge of the preceding Q3 and the first edge of the next Q3 are both incident to v. If both cubes are anchored at v, then each of these edges must have its cube\u2019s star color at v. Hence the boundary switch occurs if and only if the two star colors at v differ. Therefore, conditional on both cubes being anchored at v, the boundary switch probability equals the anchored disagreement probability R(x_v) from Lemma F. No special tie\u2011breaking is needed in anchored cubes for this conclusion.\n\n- Global anchored savings (informal summary): For each boundary, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s baseline bound is b/2 + a/2. On the subevent that both neighboring Q3\u2019s are anchored at the shared vertex v, this both\u2011good term improves from 1/2 to R(x_v), saving (1/2 \u2212 R(x_v)) \u2265 2T_v. The probability that both are anchored at v equals \u03c4_v^2 \u00b1 O(1/n) by Lemma E0 (membership under disjointness). Averaging v uniformly across boundaries (Proposition G) and summing over ~n/3 boundaries yields a net reduction of at least (2/3)\u00b7E_v[\u03c4_v^2 T_v]\u00b7n \u2212 o(n). Consequently,\n  E[switches] \u2264 (1/3 + b/12)\u00b7n \u2212 (2/3)\u00b7E_v[\u03c4_v^2 T_v]\u00b7n + o(n),\n  and since \u03c4_v^2 \u2265 1/16 \u2212 O(1/n) pointwise, an unconditional corollary is\n  E[switches] \u2264 (1/3 + b/12 \u2212 (1/24)\u00b7E_v[T_v] + o(1))\u00b7n.\n\n- Limits and focus: The anchored\u2011driven gain vanishes in the balanced regime (T_v\u22480). To improve the universal constant, we must either (i) control b strictly below 1/2 in the balanced case via local consistency (4\u2011cycles, marked\u2011Q3 types), or (ii) derive complementary both\u2011good savings using the bias parameter u_v from Corollary D with proper weighting.\n\n- Caution: A uniform inequality 1/2 \u2212 R(x) \u2265 c\u00b7T with c>2 is impossible (it fails at x\u2208{0,1}). Larger coefficients are attainable only on restricted |t| ranges.\n\nConcrete next steps\n- Enumerate marked\u2011Q3 isomorphism classes and determine their good/bad status and the f1\u2011start color at the marked vertex; set up an LP/SDP to bound b in the balanced regime, enforcing 4\u2011cycle consistency and Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s badness constraints.\n- Formalize a weighted version of Corollary D at the boundary level: express the both\u2011good boundary switch probability as an average over v with weights \u2248 density of both\u2011good disjoint pairs at v, and quantify the reduction 1/2 \u2212 (1/2)\u00b7E_v[u_v^2] + o(1) when u_v has variance.\n",

In Lemma F, the anchored\u2013anchored conditional disagreement probability at a vertex v with x=r_v/n equals\n\tR(x) = 2x^3(1\u2212x)^3 / (x^3+(1\u2212x)^3)^2 = 2y^3 / s^2.\nThen, for all x,\n\t1/2 \u2212 R(x) \u2265 2T.\nEquality holds at x\u2208{0,1/2,1}.\n\nProof. Since T=1/4\u2212y and s=1\u22123y with y\u2208[0,1/4], the inequality is equivalent to\n\t2y^3/s^2 \u2264 2y \u21d4 y^2 \u2264 s^2.\nBecause y\u22650 and s\u22650 on [0,1/4], this reduces to y \u2264 s, i.e., y \u2264 1\u22123y, which is exactly y \u2264 1/4. Equality occurs at y=0 (x\u2208{0,1}) and y=1/4 (x=1/2). \u220e\n\nProposition J (Global anchored savings in the boundary step)\nSetup. Work in Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s random antipodal geodesic scheme with k:=\u230an/3\u230b blocks and boundaries j=1,\u2026,k\u22121. Let a be the probability that two neighboring Q3\u2019s are both good, and b the probability that they are of mixed type. For a vertex v, let r_v be its red degree, x_v:=r_v/n, T_v:=(x_v\u22121/2)^2, and\n\t\u03c4_v := [C(r_v,3)+C(n\u2212r_v,3)]/C(n,3).\nFor boundary j, let v:=v_{3j} denote the shared boundary vertex, and let A_j be the event that both neighboring Q3\u2019s at boundary j are anchored at v (i.e., each has a monochromatic 3\u2011star at v in its three directions).\n\nStatement. For either of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s choices f\u2208{f1,f2}, the boundary\u2011switch probability satisfies\n\tP[switch at boundary j] \u2264 b/2 + a/2 \u2212 E[ 1_{A_j} \u00b7 (1/2 \u2212 R(x_v)) ] + o(1),\nwhere the expectation is over the randomness of the geodesic scheme and the boundary index j, v=v_{3j} is the shared boundary vertex, and R is as in Lemma I.

The baseline bound P[switch at a boundary] \u2264 b/2 + a/2 + o(1) is Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s, with o(1) from negligible pairs sharing more than one vertex. On the subevent A_j, the boundary switch occurs if and only if the two star colors at v differ, because the last edge of the j\u2011th block and the first edge of the (j+1)\u2011st block are both incident to v, and in an anchored cube the three edges at v are monochromatic. Conditioned on A_j and v, the two 3\u2011sets of directions flanking the boundary are uniformly distributed among all ordered disjoint anchored triples at v, so the conditional disagreement probability equals R(x_v) by Lemma F. Therefore, on A_j the both\u2011good contribution (bounded by 1/2 in the baseline) drops by (1/2 \u2212 R(x_v)). On the event that both cubes are good but A_j fails, we keep the crude 1/2 bound. This proves the displayed inequality.\n\nBy Proposition G, v=v_{3j} is uniformly distributed over V(Q_n) for each j. By Lemma E0 (membership under disjointness), P[A_j | v] = \u03c4_v^2 \u00b1 O(1/n). Combining with Lemma I (which gives 1/2 \u2212 R(x_v) \u2265 2T_v) yields\n\tE[ 1_{A_j} \u00b7 (1/2 \u2212 R(x_v)) ] \u2265 E_v[ (\u03c4_v^2 \u2212 O(1/n)) \u00b7 2T_v ] = 2\u00b7E_v[\u03c4_v^2 T_v] \u2212 O(1/n).\nSumming the boundary\u2011level inequality over the k\u22121 = \u0398(n) boundaries and adding the (unchanged) interior contribution 1 \u2212 p/2 per block (with p = a + b/2) gives\n\tE[switches] \u2264 (1/3 + b/12)\u00b7n \u2212 (2/3)\u00b7E_v[\u03c4_v^2 T_v]\u00b7n + o(n).\n\u220e\n\nCorollary J1 (Explicit unconditional gain under degree variance)\nStatement.

Lemma B gives \u03c4_v \u2265 1/4 \u2212 3/(4n) pointwise, hence \u03c4_v^2 \u2265 1/16 \u2212 O(1/n). Since T_v \u2265 0, E_v[\u03c4_v^2 T_v] \u2265 (1/16 \u2212 O(1/n))\u00b7E_v[T_v]. Substitute into Proposition J. \u220e\n\nRemark. The inequality in Lemma I is sharp at x\u2208{0,1/2,1}; therefore the constant 2 multiplying T is the best possible uniform constant.
