--- SYSTEM ---
You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md and output.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers
- notes.md (summary so far)
- output.md (rigorously proven results so far)

Guidelines:
- notes.md: should be a readable running log of interesting work. Prefer appending. Replace only if old notes are clearly misleading. Remember -- notes should be self-contained and should make sense even without seeing outputs of past provers. 
- output.md:  Think twice before you add something to this file. Everything here should be rigorous, almost publication-ready. It should contain only fully proven theorems that are clearly an interesting step towards the solution (or the solution itself). The beginning of the file is a clear list of interesting theorems you can prove, together with a discussion about why it is relevant. From the statement of the theorem it has to be clear that this constitutes nontrivial progress towards solution. The rest of the file contains a fully rigorous list of the proofs of the theorems. Keep only proven theorems with clear proofs. If a statement in that file is flawed / unprecise and you cannot fix it on the spot, remove it from output.md and instead add it to notes.md with explanation.
- Be careful with the booleans `new_notes_append` and `new_outputs_append`: default is True (append). Use False only when deliberately rewriting everything.

Tasks:
1) Audit rigor: identify unjustified steps, false statements, missing lemmas; produce minimal counterexamples.
2) Triage value: separate genuine progress from noise.
3) Guide next steps: propose what provers should try next.

[{"prover_id": "01", "progress_md": "Ideas and claims for this round\n\n- Goal: turn the anchored\u2013anchored refinement into a rigorous, global quantitative gain in Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s boundary term, with an explicit constant that depends only on the degree-imbalance parameter T_v := (r_v/n \u2212 1/2)^2.\n- Key new inequality (clean, universal): for any x\u2208[0,1], letting t = x \u2212 1/2 and T = t^2,\n  1/2 \u2212 2 x^3(1\u2212x)^3 / (x^3 + (1\u2212x)^3)^2 \u2265 2 T.\n  This exactly matches equality at x\u2208{0, 1/2, 1}. It bounds from below the drop below 1/2 of the anchored\u2013anchored disagreement probability (conditioned on anchoring at the shared vertex), by a linear function of T.\n- Tie-breaking convention (needed rigor): in each good Q3 and for any marked pair (v,w), among all minimal-change geodesics join\u00ading v to w, choose one whose first edge at v has the color of the 3-star at v, whenever v is anchored. This is local to the Q3, preserves minimality, and ensures that on anchored\u2013anchored boundary pairs the boundary switch occurs if and only if the two star colors at v differ. This convention does not affect the interior contribution 1 \u2212 p/2 nor Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s bad-cube handling, and property (iii) d(f(w,v), f(v,w))=1 holds automatically because we pick a single geodesic.\n\nPrecise lemmas/propositions (ready to curate next)\n\n1) Anchored disagreement dominates 2T (proof included).\n- Statement. For x\u2208[0,1], set y = x(1\u2212x)\u2208[0,1/4], t = x \u2212 1/2, T=t^2, and s = x^3+(1\u2212x)^3 = 1 \u2212 3y. The anchored\u2013anchored disagreement probability at the shared vertex v is R(x) = 2 x^3(1\u2212x)^3 / s^2. Then\n  1/2 \u2212 R(x) \u2265 2 T.\n- Proof. Using y = x(1\u2212x) = 1/4 \u2212 T and s = 1 \u2212 3y, we need to show\n  1/2 \u2212 2 y^3 / (1 \u2212 3y)^2 \u2265 2(1/4 \u2212 y) = 1/2 \u2212 2y.\n  This is equivalent to y^3/(1 \u2212 3y)^2 \u2264 y, i.e., y^2 \u2264 (1 \u2212 3y)^2. Since 0 \u2264 y \u2264 1/4, we have 0 \u2264 y \u2264 1 \u2212 3y, hence y^2 \u2264 (1 \u2212 3y)^2. Equality holds at y\u2208{0, 1/4}. \u220e\n- Why useful here: It converts the anchored\u2013anchored bias into a universal lower bound in terms of T, without relying on a small-t expansion.\n\n2) Canonical tie-breaking for anchored cubes (formalizing the convention).\n- Claim. For any good Q3 and antipodal pair (v,w), if v is anchored (its 3 incident edges have a common color), then among all minimal-change v\u2013w geodesics there exists one whose first edge at v has the star color; we fix f1(v,w), f1(w,v) to correspond to such a geodesic whenever v is anchored. This choice is local and deterministic (break residual ties lex in the set of directions) and preserves property (iii) d(f1(v,w), f1(w,v))=1.\n- Justification sketch. In Q3 there are six v\u2013w geodesics, obtained by permuting the three coordinate directions. If the star at v has color X, exactly three of these geodesics begin with an X-edge. The number of color changes along a v\u2013w geodesic depends only on the color-pattern around the three 4-cycles; reordering the step sequence does not increase the minimal number of changes (one can check by commuting adjacent steps along a monochromatic edge at v) and among minimal-change geodesics at least one begins with the star color at v. We then choose f1 to correspond to one such minimal-change geodesic. This ensures that on anchored\u2013anchored neighboring Q3\u2019s sharing v, the boundary switch occurs if and only if the two star colors at v differ.\n- Note: This tie-breaking only uses anchoring at the shared boundary vertex v; no condition at the other endpoints is required.\n\n3) Global anchored-driven improvement (explicit bound).\n- Proposition (anchored savings at boundaries). Let T_v = (r_v/n \u2212 1/2)^2 and \u03c4_v = [C(r_v,3)+C(n\u2212r_v,3)]/C(n,3). In Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s random-geodesic scheme with the tie-breaking above, the expected number of boundary switches across the k\u22121\u2248n/3 boundaries satisfies\n  E[boundary switches] \u2264 (b/2 + (1/2) a)\u00b7(n/3) \u2212 (2/3)\u00b7E_v[ \u03c4_v^2 \u00b7 T_v ]\u00b7n + o(n).\n  Consequently, the total expected switches obey\n  E[switches] \u2264 (1/3 + b/12)\u00b7n \u2212 (2/3)\u00b7E_v[ \u03c4_v^2 \u00b7 T_v ]\u00b7n + o(n).\n- Proof outline.\n  \u2022 Fix a boundary j and let v be its shared vertex; by Proposition G, v is uniform in V(Q_n). Condition on v.\n  \u2022 Among ordered v-neighbor pairs of triples, the event J_v that both Q3\u2019s are anchored at v has probability H_v, and by Lemma E0 (membership under disjointness) we have H_v = \u03c4_v^2 \u00b1 O(1/n). Note \u201canchored \u21d2 good,\u201d so J_v lies within the both-good case.\n  \u2022 Under J_v, by the tie-breaking convention the boundary switch occurs iff the two star colors at v differ. The disagreement probability equals R(x_v) with x_v = r_v/n, hence the drop below 1/2 is 1/2 \u2212 R(x_v) \u2265 2 T_v by Lemma 1. Thus the anchored savings at v on this boundary is at least H_v \u00b7 (1/2 \u2212 R(x_v)) \u2265 (\u03c4_v^2 \u2212 O(1/n)) \u00b7 2 T_v.\n  \u2022 Off J_v but still in the both-good case we retain the crude 1/2 bound from Dvo\u0159\u00e1k. In mixed and both-bad cases, we use Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s standard choice of f1/f2 to obtain \u2264 1/2 and 0, respectively, as in the original proof.\n  \u2022 Averaging v uniformly (Proposition G) and summing over \u2248n/3 boundaries yields the stated bound. The o(n) term collects O(1/n) boundary-level errors from Lemma E0 and the negligible pairs sharing more than one vertex. \u220e\n- Immediate corollary (unconditional linear gain from degree variance). Since \u03c4_v \u2265 1/4 \u2212 3/(4n), we have \u03c4_v^2 \u2265 1/16 \u2212 O(1/n). Therefore\n  E[switches] \u2264 (1/3 + b/12 \u2212 (1/24)\u00b7E_v[T_v] + o(1))\u00b7n.\n  In words: the both-good boundary contribution is strictly < 1/2 by a term \u2265 (1/12) E_v[\u03c4_v^2\u00b7T_v], and this gives a linear-in-n constant improvement whenever the mean-square degree imbalance E_v[T_v] is non-negligible.\n\nWhy useful here\n\n- This produces a fully rigorous, constant improvement in the expected number of switches in any 2-coloring with nontrivial degree variance, with an explicit quantitative coefficient 1/24 multiplying E_v[T_v].\n- It requires no small-t approximations and uses only local anchored structure plus our membership-under-disjointness and uniform-boundary lemmas already curated in output.md.\n- It isolates the truly hard regime: E_v[T_v]\u22480 (balanced degrees at almost every vertex). In that regime, the anchored-driven savings vanishes, and we must push b \u2264 1/2 \u2212 \u03b3 using 4-cycle and Q3-type consistency (the LP/SDP plan).\n\nExamples and sanity checks\n\n- Balanced degrees (r_v\u2261n/2): T_v\u22610, so the anchored savings term vanishes and the bound reduces to Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s baseline (1/3 + b/12 + o(1))\u00b7n, as expected.\n- Biased degrees on a positive fraction: If E_v[T_v] \u2265 \u03b5, then the new inequality gives a direct improvement of at least (\u03b5/24 \u2212 o(1))\u00b7n switches over the baseline constant.\n\nGaps or corrections to flag in output.md\n\n- Tie-breaking convention: output.md currently uses c_v(K) as the color of the first edge along f1 in good Q3\u2019s but does not explicitly enforce that in anchored cubes c_v(K) equals the star color. The anchored\u2013anchored disagreement calculation (Lemma F) and its use toward boundary savings require adding the explicit tie-breaking rule described above. This addition is local and benign: it does not affect minimality inside good Q3\u2019s nor the bad-cube handling and preserves property (iii) by selecting a single geodesic.\n- Global integration: output.md states the ingredients (anchored mass, disagreement expansion, membership under disjointness, uniform boundary vertex) but stops short of a formal global inequality. The Proposition above fills this gap with a clean, rigorous bound and should be added.\n- Minor: Earlier drafts used the small-t expansion 1/2 \u2212 18T + O(T^2). The new inequality 1/2 \u2212 R(x) \u2265 2T is exact and uniform, simplifying the error bookkeeping.\n\nObstacles and limits\n\n- The anchored-driven gain disappears in the balanced-degree regime. To beat 3/8 unconditionally we must either: (i) show that in any worst-case coloring E_v[T_v] is bounded below (unlikely), or (ii) prove b \u2264 1/2 \u2212 \u03b3 in the balanced regime using local consistency across 4-cycles and Q3-types.\n- The LP/SDP program for b in the balanced regime remains the central challenge. It needs enumeration of Q3 classes with a marked vertex and their good/bad status and f1-start colors, plus 4-cycle consistency constraints.\n\nNext steps (concrete, auditable)\n\n1) Curate into output.md:\n   - Lemma (anchored disagreement \u2265 2T) with the y-parameter proof.\n   - Tie-breaking convention for f1 in anchored good Q3\u2019s (a short formal lemma).\n   - Proposition (global anchored-driven improvement): E[switches] \u2264 (1/3 + b/12 \u2212 (2/3)\u00b7E_v[\u03c4_v^2 T_v] + o(1))\u00b7n and the corollary with 1/24\u00b7E_v[T_v].\n2) Balanced-regime LP: proceed with the symmetric case r_v\u2261n/2; enumerate Q3 2-coloring classes with a marked vertex, tag good/bad and f1-start colors; encode 4-cycle consistency; maximize b. A numerical \u03b3>0 would guide an analytic proof.\n3) Optional strengthening: derive a complementary both-good refinement via u_v from Corollary D. Show that the both-good boundary switch probability \u2264 1/2 \u2212 (1/2)\u00b7E_v[u_v^2] + o(1) (properly weighted). This would give savings even in some balanced-degree instances if u_v has variance.\n\nNotes on verification\n\n- All ingredients used (Lemma B, Lemma E0, Lemma F, Proposition G) are already in output.md; the only new facts are the exact inequality 1/2 \u2212 R(x) \u2265 2T (with proof) and the tie-breaking convention.\n- The global bound follows by linearity of expectation and uniformity of boundary vertices; the o(1) term aggregates O(1/n) errors per boundary from Lemma E0 and negligible overlapping-pair contributions (as in Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s original argument).\n"}, {"prover_id": "02", "progress_md": "Round 0004 \u2014 Exact anchored drop inequality; clean global integration; comments on output.md\n\nQuick audit of output.md (gaps and precisions)\n- Positive: The curated Lemma E0 (membership under disjointness), Lemma F (anchored\u2013anchored counts and the closed form P_v[disagree | anchored]), Corollary H (a \u2265 1/16 \u2212 O(1/n)), and Proposition G (uniformity of the shared boundary vertex) are all correct and highly useful.\n- Minor clarity: Lemma F treats ordered pairs; most boundary probabilities are symmetric under swapping the two neighboring Q3\u2019s. The ordered/unordered distinction does not affect the ratios we use (it cancels), but stating this explicitly where the boundary step is integrated would forestall confusion.\n- Missing integration: The refined both-good boundary contribution (anchored savings) is not yet written as a global inequality. With Proposition G and Lemma E0 now curated, we can add it rigorously. I provide a clean statement and proof below (Proposition J\u2019), together with a universal, exact anchored-drop inequality (Lemma I) that avoids asymptotics.\n\nNew lemmas (exact, checkable) \u2014 to add\n- Lemma I (Universal anchored-drop inequality).\n  \u2022 Statement. Let r be the red degree at a vertex v and set x:=r/n and t:=x\u22121/2. In Lemma F, the anchored\u2013anchored conditional disagreement probability equals\n    P_v[disagree | anchored] = 2x^3(1\u2212x)^3 / (x^3+(1\u2212x)^3)^2.\n    Then, for all x\u2208[0,1],\n    1/2 \u2212 P_v[disagree | anchored] \u2265 2 t^2 = 2 (r/n \u2212 1/2)^2.\n  \u2022 Proof. Write u:=t^2\u2208[0,1/4] and y:=4u\u2208[0,1]. Using the identities x(1\u2212x)=1/4\u2212u and x^3+(1\u2212x)^3=1/4+3u, we compute\n    P_v[disagree | anchored] = 2(1/4\u2212u)^3 / (1/4+3u)^2.\n    Hence the claimed inequality is equivalent to\n    2(1/4\u2212u)^3 \u2264 (1/2\u22122u)(1/4+3u)^2.\n    Multiplying out and scaling by 32, this becomes (1\u2212y)^3 \u2264 (1\u2212y)(1+3y)^2, i.e., (1\u2212y)^2 \u2264 (1+3y)^2, which is true for all y\u2208[0,1]. Equality holds at y=0 and y=1. \u220e\n  \u2022 Why useful: This gives an absolute quadratic drop from 1/2, uniform in n and without O(\u00b7) terms, and is tight at the extremes. It upgrades the asymptotic 18t^2 expansion to a rigorous inequality valid for all r.\n\n- Proposition J\u2019 (Global anchored savings in the boundary step).\n  \u2022 Setup. Use Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s scheme with k:=n/3 blocks and boundaries j=1,\u2026,k\u22121. Let Bj be the event that both neighboring Q3\u2019s at boundary j are good, and Aj the subevent that both are anchored at their shared vertex v_{3j}. Let \u03c4_v be as in Lemma B and T_v:=(r_v/n \u2212 1/2)^2.\n  \u2022 Claim. For either choice f\u2208{f1,f2} from Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s proof, the boundary-switch probability at boundary j satisfies\n    P[switch at boundary j] \u2264 b/2 + (a/2) \u2212 E[ 1_{Aj} \u00b7 (1/2 \u2212 P_v[disagree | anchored]) ] + o(1),\n    where the expectation averages over the random geodesic and the boundary index j, and v is the shared boundary vertex.\n    Consequently,\n    E[switches] \u2264 (1/3 + b/12)\u00b7n \u2212 (2/3)\u00b7E_v[ \u03c4_v^2\u00b7T_v ]\u00b7n + o(n).\n  \u2022 Proof. The baseline bound b/2 + (1/2)a + o(1) for P[switch at a boundary] is exactly Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s estimate, with the o(1) from excluding pairs sharing more than one vertex. On the subevent Aj, by Lemma I we have 1/2 \u2212 P_v[disagree | anchored] \u2265 2T_v; hence on Aj the both-good contribution drops by at least 2T_v. On B_j\u2216A_j (both good but not both anchored), we keep the crude 1/2 bound. Therefore\n    P[switch at boundary j] \u2264 b/2 + (a/2) \u2212 E[ 1_{Aj}\u00b7(1/2 \u2212 P_v[disagree | anchored]) ] + o(1).\n    By Proposition G, v=v_{3j} is uniform over V(Q_n), and by Lemma E0, P[Aj | v] = \u03c4_v^2 \u00b1 O(1/n). Combining with Lemma I and averaging over j gives\n    E[ 1_{Aj}\u00b7(1/2 \u2212 P_v[disagree | anchored]) ] \u2265 E_v[ \u03c4_v^2\u00b7(2T_v) ] \u2212 O(1/n).\n    Summing over the k\u22121\u2248n/3 boundaries yields the stated global inequality. \u220e\n  \u2022 Corollary (explicit unconditional gain in degree-unbalanced regime). Since \u03c4_v \u2265 1/4 \u2212 3/(4n) (Lemma B), we have \u03c4_v^2 \u2265 1/16 \u2212 O(1/n) uniformly. Hence\n    E[switches] \u2264 (1/3 + b/12 \u2212 (1/24 \u2212 o(1))\u00b7E_v[T_v])\u00b7n + o(n).\n    Thus any fixed lower bound on the mean-square degree imbalance E_v[T_v] yields a linear constant improvement over the (1/3 + b/12) baseline.\n\nWhy this is useful here\n- Lemma I eliminates the asymptotic expansion in Lemma F and gives a clean, exact inequality. Proposition J\u2019 completes the missing integration, showing precisely how anchored pairs reduce the both-good boundary contribution and quantifying the net effect.\n- The corollary isolates the \u201cbalanced-degree\u201d regime (E_v[T_v]\u22480) as the only obstruction; this sharpens the target for the b-optimization program (LP/SDP in the balanced case).\n\nExamples and sanity checks\n- Extremal balance r_v\u2261n/2: T_v\u22610 implies no anchored savings, recovering Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s baseline (1/3 + b/12 + o(1))\u00b7n.\n- Extremal bias r_v\u2208{0,n}: T_v=1/4, \u03c4_v=1, Lemma I gives 1/2 \u2212 P[disagree|anchored]=1/2. Proposition J\u2019 then yields E[switches] \u2264 (1/3 + b/12 \u2212 (2/3)\u00b7(1\u00b71/4))\u00b7n = (1/3 + b/12 \u2212 1/6)\u00b7n. This matches the intuition that fully monochromatic stars at every vertex allow very low boundary switch rates.\n\nIdeas toward the balanced regime (b \u2264 1/2 \u2212 \u03b3)\n- LP skeleton refinement (balanced r_v\u2261n/2):\n  \u2022 Variables: frequencies of the 4-cycle types at v; frequencies of marked-Q3 types (good/bad) with f1-start color at v; frequencies of disjoint marked-Q3 pairs at v with type-type combinations (subject to symmetry constraints).\n  \u2022 Constraints: marginalization to 1-edge and 4-cycle types; Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s Lemma 9 \u201cbadness filter\u201d at v and the opposite vertex of Q3; consistency across the four Q3\u2019s sharing a fixed 4-cycle through v.\n  \u2022 Objective: maximize b_v (good\u2013bad fraction among disjoint pairs). Investigate numerically whether the optimum is < 1/2 under these local consistency constraints.\n- Enumerative input: Enumerate 2-colorings of Q3 with a marked vertex up to Aut(Q3), tag good/bad, and, for good, record the f1-start color at the mark under a fixed tie-breaking.\n\nObstacles and notes\n- Weighting: The boundary contribution is a weighted average over shared vertices; Proposition G addresses this by uniformizing v_{3j}. The only residual error is the O(1/n) from disjointness conditioning (Lemma E0), absorbed in o(1).\n- Ordered vs unordered pairs: Our anchored calculations use ordered counts (Lemma F) but the translation to probabilities and to boundary events is invariant under order, so the distinction does not affect the inequalities; stating this explicitly in output.md would help.\n- LP scale: Encoding joint constraints for disjoint marked-Q3 pairs may grow rapidly; symmetry reductions (balanced case, color-swap, coordinate permutations) will be crucial.\n\nNext steps (auditable)\n1) Add Lemma I and Proposition J\u2019 (with proof) to output.md. This will complete the anchored-based refinement rigorously and yield the corollary with the explicit (1/24)\u00b7E_v[T_v] improvement.\n2) Q3 pattern enumeration with a marked vertex: list isomorphism classes, classify good/bad, and, for good, record f1-start color at the mark. This feeds the LP in the balanced regime.\n3) Build the first LP relaxation in the symmetric (balanced) case and solve numerically to test if b \u2264 1/2 \u2212 \u03b3 (\u03b3>0) follows from 4-cycle and badness constraints.\n4) Optional sharpening: Using Lemma F\u2019s exact formula, one can improve the constant 2 in Lemma I for small |t| (the Taylor coefficient is 18). Prove a global bound of the form 1/2 \u2212 P_v[disagree|anchored] \u2265 c\u00b7T_v with c>2 (e.g., c=3) valid for all t; this would slightly strengthen the anchored gain constant beyond 1/24 without relying on small-t asymptotics."}]

Context and target in Dvořák’s framework
- Dvořák’s modified-geodesic scheme yields the bound E[switches] ≤ (1/3 + b/12 + o(1))·n, where b is the probability that two uniformly random neighboring Q3’s (sharing exactly one vertex) have mixed types (one good, one bad). Because p cancels via p = a + b/2, any constant improvement over 3/8 must either prove b ≤ 1/2 − γ for some absolute γ>0, or reduce the 1/2 bound in the a-term (both-good case).

Why naive block-density does not imply expansion (correct counterexample)
- Brainstorm claim (now rejected): “If a color occupies at least an ε-fraction of each block boundary δS_J for (1−θ) of the blocks, then that color has conductance Ω(ε).” This is false without further structure (e.g., endpoint balance and degree spread).
- Construction (valid undirected 2-coloring): Fix j:[n]→[n] such that j(i)≠i for all i. For each i-edge {x, x⊕e_i}, let y be the endpoint with y_i=0 and color the edge blue iff y_{j(i)}=1; otherwise red. Then for each i, exactly half of the i-edges are blue (so β_J=1/2 for every block J). Yet the blue subgraph can be extremely sparse at many vertices; e.g., if j(1)=2 and j(i)=1 for all i≥2, then for a vertex v, deg_B(v) = (n−1)·[v_1=1] + [v_2=1]. In particular, all vertices with (v_1,v_2)=(0,0) are isolated. Thus block-level edge-density alone does not imply connectivity, let alone conductance.
- Separate but related flaw: Even if a block J has aggregate blue-density β_J = 1/2+ε, one can realize this with each direction i∈J having density 1/2+ε. A geodesic that uses each direction exactly once then sees ≈(1/2−ε)|J| minority edges on average, not O(ε|J|). Any O(ε|J|) claim must extract stronger inner-block structure (e.g., many near-monochromatic directions).

Vertex-wise Kneser-graph formulation and spectral bound
- For a fixed vertex v, Q3’s through v correspond to 3-subsets of [n]. Two Q3’s are v-neighbors iff their 3-sets are disjoint; this is the Kneser graph KG(n,3). If G_v⊆C([n],3) is the set of “good” triples at v, then b_v is the fraction of edges in KG(n,3) crossing the cut (G_v, its complement). The parameter b equals the average of b_v over v, up to negligible normalization.
- Spectral MAX-CUT bound in KG(n,3): KG(n,3) is d-regular with d= C(n−3,3), and its least eigenvalue is −C(n−4,2). Hence for any cut, the crossing-edge fraction is ≤ 1/2 − λ_min/(2d) = 1/2 + 3/(2(n−3)). Therefore b ≤ 1/2 + 3/(2(n−3)). This recovers Dvořák’s b ≤ 1/2 + o(1) and makes the o(1) term explicit.

Per-vertex monochromatic-star lower bound (useful bookkeeping)
- For a vertex v with red degree r_v, the fraction of 3-subsets K such that the three edges at v in directions K are monochromatic equals [C(r_v,3) + C(n−r_v,3)] / C(n,3). This is minimized near r_v≈n/2; explicitly: for n even it equals 2·C(n/2,3)/C(n,3), and for n odd it equals [C((n−1)/2,3)+C((n+1)/2,3)]/C(n,3). Asymptotically this is 1/4 − 3/(4n) + O(1/n^2). This sharpened estimate alone cannot beat 3/8 but is a clean input for any refined accounting of the a-term.

Promising directions to reduce b or the a-term
- LP/SDP relaxation for b: Model local pattern frequencies around v (1-edge colors; 4-cycle types; Q3-types with the f1-chosen color), enforce marginal and 4-cycle consistency, and maximize b. Any universal optimum < 1/2 indicates a path to a combinatorial proof.
- Good–good boundary improvement: Enumerate good Q3 classes, fix canonical tie-breaking for f1, and measure the disagreement probability at v between two disjoint good Q3’s. If it is ≤ 1/2 − η for some η>0, the a-term improves by η.
- Structural lemmas: Seek negative correlation between “badness” indicators for disjoint triples at v, induced by 4-cycle constraints and the forbidden patterns of bad Q3’s. Any quantified negative correlation lowers b below the vertexwise MAX-CUT upper bound.

What to avoid or strengthen
- Avoid relying on block-level densities without per-direction endpoint balance and degree-spread conditions. Any block-phase lemma should explicitly include such hypotheses (e.g., each direction in a good block has bias ≥ε and each vertex has ≥ρ·|J| majority-color incident edges within that block).
Refinement of the both-good boundary step via per-vertex bias
- For a fixed vertex v, let G_v ⊆ C([n],3) denote the collection of 3-sets K for which Q3(v,K) is “good” in Dvořák’s sense. Fix a deterministic tie-breaking for f1 inside each good Q3. Define c_v(K) ∈ {R,B} as the color of the first edge at v along the f1-path inside Q3(v,K). Let t_v = |G_v|, p_v := |{K∈G_v : c_v(K)=R}|/t_v, and u_v := |2p_v − 1|.
- Sampling heuristic made precise: If we pick two good v-neighbor Q3’s uniformly at random (i.e., two disjoint K,L ∈ G_v, unordered), the event “boundary switch occurs” equals [c_v(K) ≠ c_v(L)]. The disjointness constraint perturbs the color distribution only by O(1/n) since each K forbids only O(n^2) partners while t_v = Θ(n^3) (once we know a constant fraction of triples are good at v).

A general pair-sampling lemma (usable abstractly)
- Let T ⊆ C([n],3) be any subset of size t, and c: T → {R,B} any labeling. Let p = |{K∈T: c(K)=R}|/t. If we draw an unordered pair {K,L} uniformly from all disjoint pairs with K,L∈T, then
  P[c(K) ≠ c(L)] = 2p(1−p) ± O(n^2/t).
  Proof idea: For any fixed K, the “forbidden” set S_K = {L∈T: L∩K≠∅} has size O(n^2), so conditioning L to be disjoint from K changes its color distribution by at most O(|S_K|/t) = O(n^2/t). Averaging over K and expanding E[disagree|K] shows that the deviation from 2p(1−p) is bounded by the average of these perturbations.
- Application to both-good pairs at v: Taking T = G_v yields
  P_v[boundary switch | both-good at v] = 1/2 − u_v^2/2 ± O(n^2/t_v).
  By “anchored implies good” (imported from Dvořák) and Lemma B, t_v ≥ (1/4 − O(1/n))·C(n,3) = Θ(n^3), so the error is O(1/n). Note the global “both-good” boundary probability is a weighted average of the per-v quantities with weights proportional to the mass of both-good pairs at v.

Degree imbalance induces bias in c_v via anchored triples
- Let r_v be the red degree at v and x_v = r_v/n. Among all triples K with monochromatic stars at v (anchored at v), c_v(K) is forced to be the star color. Consequently, even ignoring non-anchored good triples one gets
  u_v ≥ |C(r_v,3) − C(n−r_v,3)| / (C(r_v,3) + C(n−r_v,3)).
  For x_v = 1/2 + η with |η| ≪ 1, this gives u_v ≥ 6|η| + O(η^3). Therefore, if a positive fraction ρ of vertices satisfy |x_v − 1/2| ≥ η_0, then E_v[u_v^2] ≥ c·ρ·η_0^2 for some absolute c>0.

Corrected anchored–anchored counts at a fixed vertex
- For r=r_v and b=n−r, the number of ordered v-neighbor pairs (K,L) with both cubes anchored at v equals
  C(r,3)C(r−3,3) + 2C(r,3)C(b,3) + C(b,3)C(b−3,3).
  Among these, the pairs with disagreeing star colors at v are exactly the mixed-color ones, counted by 2C(r,3)C(b,3). Therefore,
  P_v[disagree | both anchored at v] = 2C(r,3)C(b,3) / [C(r,3)C(r−3,3) + 2C(r,3)C(b,3) + C(b,3)C(b−3,3)].
  As n→∞ with x=r/n and t=x−1/2,
  P_v[disagree | anchored] = 2x^3(1−x)^3/(x^3+(1−x)^3)^2 + O(1/n) = 1/2 − 18t^2 + O(t^4 + 1/n).
  In particular, at balance (x=1/2) the anchored–anchored disagreement probability is 1/2 and the anchored–anchored pair probability is ≈(x^3+(1−x)^3)^2 = (1/4)^2 = 1/16 (up to O(1/n)), not 1/32.

Dichotomy and plan
- Unbalanced regime: If E_v[(x_v−1/2)^2] is bounded below, then E_v[u_v^2] is bounded below, and the both-good boundary term drops by a constant (via the pair-sampling lemma), yielding a linear improvement. Anchored–anchored pairs certify this effect concretely.
- Balanced regime: When x_v≈1/2 for most v, we must leverage structural constraints (4-cycle consistency, interaction of good/bad patterns across pairs) to bound b<1/2. Proceed with the proposed LP using: star-type frequencies, 4-cycle types, Q3-types-with-marked-v and their f1-start labels, symmetry constraints, and Dvořák’s characterization of bad cubes.

Immediate technical tasks
- Import or re-prove “anchored at v ⇒ good” to firm up the O(1/n) error uniformly.
- Prove that the anchored–anchored probability is minimized at r≈n/2 for all n≥6 (discrete convexity of F(m)=C(m,3)C(m−3,3) plus symmetry).
- Enumerate Q3 2-coloring classes with marked v; for each good class determine the f1-start at v. This feeds the LP for b in the balanced regime.
Additions and refinements (Round 0003)

1) Correction to the baseline interior contribution
- In Dvořák’s scheme the expected number of color changes inside a Q3-block is 1 − p/2 per block (not 1 − p^2). With p = a + b/2 this yields the baseline (1/3 + b/12 + o(1))·n for E[switches].

2) Anchored cubes and a uniform nontrivial anchored mass
- Anchored-at-v cubes (three edges at v all the same color in the chosen 3 directions) are good (Dvořák, Lemma 8). Consequently, anchored–anchored neighboring pairs form a subset of both-good pairs. For a vertex v with r red and b=n−r blue incident edges, the exact anchored–anchored (ordered) pair probability is
  H(r,n) = [ C(r,3)C(r−3,3) + 2C(r,3)C(b,3) + C(b,3)C(b−3,3) ] / [ C(n,3)C(n−3,3) ].
  As n→∞ with x=r/n, H(r,n) = (x^3 + (1−x)^3)^2 + O(1/n), minimized at x=1/2; hence H(r,n) ≥ 1/16 − O(1/n).
- A discrete, uniform lower bound that avoids minimizing H directly follows from a general “membership under disjointness” lemma: if T⊆C([n],3) has density τ, then for a uniform ordered disjoint pair (K,L) from all triples, P[K,L∈T] = τ^2 ± O(1/n). Applying this to the anchored set T_v gives P[both anchored at v] = τ_v^2 ± O(1/n), and since τ_v ≥ 1/4 − 3/(4n) (Lemma B), we conclude a ≥ 1/16 − O(1/n) unconditionally.

3) Anchored–anchored disagreement probability
- Conditioning on both Q3’s being anchored at v, the exact disagreement probability at v equals
  P_v[disagree | anchored] = 2C(r,3)C(b,3) / [ C(r,3)C(r−3,3) + 2C(r,3)C(b,3) + C(b,3)C(b−3,3) ].
  With x=r/n and t=x−1/2, as n→∞,
  P_v[disagree | anchored] = 2x^3(1−x)^3 / (x^3+(1−x)^3)^2 + O(1/n) = 1/2 − 18t^2 + O(t^4 + 1/n).
  Thus degree imbalance |t|≥η enforces a quadratic drop below 1/2 in the both-good boundary switch probability on the anchored submass.

4) Uniformity of boundary vertices in the random-geodesic model
- In Dvořák’s random antipodal geodesic scheme (uniform start vertex and uniform coordinate permutation), the shared vertex v_{3j} at each boundary j is uniformly distributed over V(Q_n). Hence vertex-averages at boundaries equal uniform averages over V(Q_n).

5) Path to a refined global bound
- Let T_v = (r_v/n − 1/2)^2. Using the anchored–anchored mass and the anchored disagreement drop, one can define a nonnegative anchored savings Δ_anchor ≈ E_v[H(r_v,n)·(1/2 − P_v[disagree | anchored])]. Inserting this at each boundary yields a refined inequality of the schematic form
  E[switches] ≤ (1/3 + b/12 − (1/3)·Δ_anchor + o(1))·n.
  Using H(r,n) ≥ 1/16 − O(1/n) and the 18T_v drop gives an unconditional gain ≳ (3/8)·E_v[T_v]·n in regimes with nontrivial degree variance. Formalizing this integration (with accurate o(1) control and precise weights) is the next task.

6) Open technical point
- Discrete minimization: prove that H(r,n) is minimized at r∈{⌊n/2⌋,⌈n/2⌉} for all n≥6. A direct sign analysis of H(r+1,n)−H(r,n) should suffice.

List of proven intermediate results
- Theorem A (Spectral upper bound on the parameter b in Dvořák’s scheme).
- Lemma B (Per-vertex lower bound on monochromatic-star triples).

Theorem A (Spectral upper bound on b)
Statement. Let Q_n be the n-dimensional hypercube with an arbitrary 2-coloring of its edges, and let b denote the probability that two uniformly random neighboring 3-cubes (Q3’s) are of mixed type (one good, one bad) in the sense of Dvořák’s construction. Then for all n ≥ 6,

b ≤ 1/2 + 3/(2(n−3)).

Consequently, Dvořák’s expected switch bound refines to
E[switches] ≤ (1/3 + 1/24 + 1/(8(n−3)) + o(1))·n = (3/8 + 1/(8(n−3)) + o(1))·n.

Proof. Fix a vertex v of Q_n. Q3’s through v correspond bijectively to 3-subsets K ⊆ [n] (the chosen directions), and two such Q3’s are v-neighbors if and only if the 3-sets are disjoint. Thus, the v-neighborhood relation is the Kneser graph KG(n,3) on vertex-set C([n],3), which is d-regular with degree d = C(n−3,3). Let G_v ⊆ C([n],3) be the set of “good” triples at v. The fraction b_v of v-neighbor pairs that are mixed equals the fraction of edges in KG(n,3) crossing the cut (G_v, C([n],3) \ G_v). The global parameter b is the average of b_v over all v (this is a direct consequence of the definition of “neighboring Q3’s” as sharing exactly one vertex; each ordered choice of the shared vertex v and a disjoint pair of triples contributes equally).

For any d-regular graph with adjacency matrix A and least eigenvalue λ_min, the size of any cut is at most |E|·(1/2 − λ_min/(2d)). This follows from the identity that, for a ±1 vector s indicating a cut, the number of crossing edges equals |E|/2 − (1/4) s^T A s, combined with s^T A s ≥ λ_min · s^T s = λ_min · |V| and |E| = d|V|/2. The Kneser graph KG(n,3) has spectrum { C(n−3,3), −C(n−4,2), n−5, −1 } (standard; see e.g. Lovász, 1979), so λ_min = −C(n−4,2). Hence every cut in KG(n,3) has crossing-edge fraction at most 1/2 − (−C(n−4,2))/(2 C(n−3,3)) = 1/2 + C(n−4,2)/(2 C(n−3,3)) = 1/2 + 3/(2(n−3)). Therefore b_v ≤ 1/2 + 3/(2(n−3)) for each v, and averaging gives the same bound for b. The stated corollary for E[switches] follows by substitution into Dvořák’s expression. ∎

Lemma B (Per-vertex lower bound on monochromatic-star triples)
Statement. Let v be a vertex of Q_n and let r_v be the number of red edges incident to v (so n − r_v are blue). The fraction of 3-sets K ⊆ [n] such that the three edges at v with directions K are monochromatic equals

τ_v = [ C(r_v,3) + C(n − r_v,3) ] / C(n,3).

In particular, τ_v is minimized when r_v ∈ {⌊n/2⌋, ⌈n/2⌉}. For n even, the minimum equals 2·C(n/2,3)/C(n,3); for n odd, it equals [C((n−1)/2,3) + C((n+1)/2,3)]/C(n,3). As n→∞, uniformly in v,
	τ_v ≥ 1/4 − 3/(4n) + O(1/n^2).

Proof. Among all 3-sets K, exactly C(r_v,3) of them consist of three red directions at v, and exactly C(n − r_v,3) consist of three blue directions at v. There are C(n,3) total 3-sets, so the fraction is τ_v as stated. Define g(r) = C(r,3) + C(n − r,3) for integer r. Then g(r+1) − g(r) = C(r,2) − C(n − r − 1,2), which is negative for r < (n−1)/2 and positive for r > (n−1)/2; hence g is minimized at r ∈ {⌊n/2⌋, ⌈n/2⌉}. Substituting these values yields the explicit minima. The asymptotic expansion follows by a routine Taylor expansion of the ratio of polynomials in n. ∎
Lemma C (Pair-sampling stability under a disjointness constraint)
Statement. Let n≥6 and let T⊆C([n],3) be any subset of 3-sets of size t=|T|. Fix any labeling c: T→{R,B} and write p := |{K∈T : c(K)=R}|/t. If an unordered pair {K,L} is drawn uniformly from all pairs with K,L∈T and K∩L=∅, then

P[c(K)≠c(L)] = 2p(1−p) ± C·(n^2/t),

for some absolute constant C>0 (independent of n and T).

Proof. For K∈T, let T_K := {L∈T : L∩K=∅} and write q(K) := |{L∈T_K : c(L)=R}|/|T_K|. Let s(K):=1 if c(K)=R and 0 otherwise. If we generate a random unordered disjoint pair by first sampling K uniformly from T and then sampling L uniformly from T_K (and finally forgetting the order), its law is within a factor 2 of the uniform law on unordered disjoint pairs, so computing the disagreement probability under this sequential scheme suffices up to a harmless constant normalization (which cancels in the final equality below).

For fixed K, the probability of disagreement equals s(K)·(1−q(K)) + (1−s(K))·q(K). Averaging over K gives

P[c(K)≠c(L)] = E_K[q(K)] + E_K[s(K)] − 2E_K[q(K)·s(K)].

Let p = E_K[s(K)] and write q(K)=p+δ(K). Then

P[c(K)≠c(L)] = 2p(1−p) + E_K[δ(K)·(1−2s(K))].

Hence |P[c(K)≠c(L)] − 2p(1−p)| ≤ E_K[|δ(K)|]. It remains to bound |δ(K)| uniformly. For any K, all elements of T that are excluded from T_K (including K itself) lie in the set S_K := {L∈T : L∩K≠∅}∪{K}. Since K is a 3-set, the number of 3-sets intersecting K is at most 3·C(n−1,2) + 3·(n−1) + 1 = O(n^2). Therefore, removing S_K from T perturbs the color fraction by at most |S_K|/t ≤ C′·n^2/t for some absolute C′, i.e., |δ(K)| ≤ C′·n^2/t. Averaging over K yields the claimed bound with C=C′. ∎

Corollary D (Refined both-good disagreement at a fixed vertex)
Statement. Fix a vertex v. Let G_v⊆C([n],3) be the set of “good” triples at v (in Dvořák’s scheme), let t_v=|G_v|, and define c_v:G_v→{R,B} as the color of the first edge at v selected by f1 inside Q3(v,K). Set p_v := |{K∈G_v : c_v(K)=R}|/t_v and u_v := |2p_v−1|. Then, when {K,L} is drawn uniformly from unordered pairs of disjoint elements of G_v,

P[c_v(K)≠c_v(L)] = 1/2 − u_v^2/2 ± C·(n^2/t_v),

with the same absolute constant C as in Lemma C. In particular, if t_v ≥ δ·C(n,3) for some absolute δ>0 (as ensured once one imports that every monochromatic star at v is good), then the error term is O(1/n).

Proof. Apply Lemma C with T=G_v and p=p_v; observe that 2p_v(1−p_v) = 1/2 − u_v^2/2. ∎

Remark (Applicability in Dvořák’s framework). By standard facts in the modified-geodesic scheme (anchored-at-v cubes are good), Lemma B implies t_v ≥ [C(r_v,3)+C(n−r_v,3)], whence t_v = Θ(n^3) uniformly in v. Thus the error term in the corollary is O(1/n).

Lemma E0 (Membership under disjointness)
Statement. Let n≥6 and let T⊆C([n],3) have cardinality |T| = τ·C(n,3). Let (K,L) be a uniformly random ordered pair of disjoint 3-sets from C([n],3). Then
	P[K∈T and L∈T] = τ^2 ± C·(1/n)
for some absolute constant C>0 (independent of n and T).

Proof. Generate (K,L) by first choosing K uniformly from C([n],3) and then choosing L uniformly from the family of 3-sets disjoint from K. Let M:=C(n,3) and S_K be the set of triples intersecting K, so |S_K|=M−C(n−3,3)=O(n^2). Then
	P[L∈T | K] = (|T| − |T∩S_K|) / (M − |S_K|) = τ + ε(K),
with |ε(K)| ≤ max{|T∩S_K|, τ|S_K|}/(M−|S_K|) ≤ c/n for some absolute c>0, since |T∩S_K|≤|S_K|=O(n^2) and M−|S_K|=C(n−3,3)=Θ(n^3). Therefore
	P[K∈T and L∈T] = E[1_{K∈T}·P(L∈T|K)] = E[1_{K∈T}]·τ + E[1_{K∈T}·ε(K)] = τ^2 ± E|ε(K)| = τ^2 ± O(1/n).
∎

Lemma E (Anchored at v implies good)
Statement. In Dvořák’s framework for Q3-blocks, if a 3-cube Q3 has a vertex v such that the three edges incident to v within Q3 are monochromatic, then Q3 is good (in the sense used by the modified-geodesic scheme).

Proof. This is Dvořák’s Lemma 8 (see Dvořák, “A note on edge-colorings of the hypercube” [exact citation as in the original source]). A short case analysis shows that from a monochromatic 3-star at v one can construct the required monochromatic antipodal geodesics (or the canonical f1-path with the requisite bound on color changes), hence goodness. We invoke the lemma as a quoted result. ∎

Lemma F (Anchored–anchored counts and disagreement probability at a fixed vertex)
Statement. Fix a vertex v of Q_n. Let r be the number of red edges incident to v, and let b:=n−r. Consider ordered pairs (K,L) of disjoint 3-sets of coordinates. A Q3(v,K) is “anchored red at v” if all three edges from v in directions K are red, and analogously for blue. Then:
- The number of ordered disjoint pairs (K,L) with both Q3’s anchored at v equals
	C(r,3)·C(r−3,3) + 2·C(r,3)·C(b,3) + C(b,3)·C(b−3,3).
- The total number of ordered disjoint pairs equals C(n,3)·C(n−3,3).
- Therefore, the anchored–anchored probability at v is
	H(r,n) = [ C(r,3)C(r−3,3) + 2 C(r,3)C(b,3) + C(b,3)C(b−3,3) ] / [ C(n,3)C(n−3,3) ].
- Among anchored–anchored pairs, the conditional disagreement probability at v (i.e., the two star colors at v differ) is
	P_v[disagree | anchored at v] = 2 C(r,3) C(b,3) / [ C(r,3)C(r−3,3) + 2 C(r,3)C(b,3) + C(b,3)C(b−3,3) ].
Moreover, as n→∞ with x=r/n and t=x−1/2,
	H(r,n) = (x^3 + (1−x)^3)^2 + O(1/n),
	P_v[disagree | anchored] = 1/2 − 18 t^2 + O(t^4 + 1/n).

Proof. The counts are immediate: choose K by selecting 3 directions of the appropriate color, then choose L as any disjoint triple of the indicated color pattern; the factor 2 accounts for the ordered mixed-color case. The total number of ordered disjoint pairs is C(n,3) choices for K times C(n−3,3) choices for L. Dividing yields the probabilities.
For the asymptotics, write r = xn and b = (1−x)n. Using C(m,3) = m^3/6 + O(m^2), the numerator of H equals [r^3 + b^3]^2/36 + O(n^5) and the denominator equals n^6/36 + O(n^5), so H = [(x^3+(1−x)^3)^2] + O(1/n). For the disagreement expansion, observe that
	P_v[disagree | anchored] = 2 [x^3(1−x)^3]/[x^3+(1−x)^3]^2.
Setting x = 1/2 + t and using x(1−x) = 1/4 − t^2 and x^3+(1−x)^3 = 1 − 3x(1−x) = 1/4 + 3t^2 gives
	P_v[disagree | anchored] = 2(1/4 − t^2)^3 / (1/4 + 3t^2)^2 = 1/2 − 18 t^2 + O(t^4),
with an additional O(1/n) from the binomial-to-polynomial approximation. ∎

Corollary H (Unconditional lower bound on a)
Statement. Let a denote the probability that two uniformly random neighboring Q3’s (sharing exactly one vertex) are both good. Then
	a ≥ 1/16 − O(1/n).

Proof. Fix a vertex v and let T_v be the set of 3-sets whose stars at v are monochromatic. By Lemma B, |T_v|/C(n,3) = τ_v ≥ 1/4 − 3/(4n). By Lemma E (anchored ⇒ good), any pair with K,L∈T_v yields two good Q3’s; hence, among ordered neighboring pairs with shared vertex v, the probability that both are good is at least P[K,L∈T_v]. By Lemma E0, P[K,L∈T_v] = τ_v^2 ± O(1/n). Therefore, for each v,
	P[both good | shared vertex v] ≥ (1/4 − 3/(4n))^2 − O(1/n) = 1/16 − O(1/n).
By vertex-transitivity (the number of neighboring pairs sharing v is the same for all v), the global parameter a is the uniform average of these per-v probabilities, so the same lower bound holds for a. ∎

Proposition G (Uniformity of the shared boundary vertex)
Statement. In Dvořák’s random antipodal geodesic model (uniform start vertex v0 and uniform random permutation of coordinates), for any fixed j in {1,…,⌊n/3⌋−1}, the shared vertex v_{3j} at the j-th block boundary is uniformly distributed over V(Q_n). Consequently, for any bounded function φ on V(Q_n), E[φ(v_{3j})] = (1/|V|)∑_{v} φ(v).

Proof. We have v_{3j} = v0 ⊕ S_j, where S_j is the XOR of the first 3j coordinate directions of the permutation. For any fixed y, the number of pairs (v0,S_j) producing y equals the number producing 0 (translation-invariance of Q_n). Hence v_{3j} is uniform. Linearity gives the averaging statement. ∎
