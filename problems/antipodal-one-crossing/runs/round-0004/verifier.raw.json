The key algebraic inequality 1/2 − R(x) ≥ 2T (where R(x)=2x^3(1−x)^3/(x^3+(1−x)^3)^2 and T=(x−1/2)^2) is correct, sharp at x∈{0,1/2,1}, and removes the need for small‑t expansions. The proposed global integration (subtracting the anchored savings from the both‑good boundary contribution) is also sound and, after averaging the shared boundary vertex using Proposition G and using Lemma E0 to handle the disjointness conditioning, yields a rigorous improvement of order (2/3)·E_v[τ_v^2 T_v]·n, and hence the simple corollary with constant 1/24 multiplying E_v[T_v].\\n\\nTwo points to correct/clarify:\\n- Tie‑breaking is not needed for the anchored‑anchored boundary refinement. In a boundary between consecutive blocks, the last edge of the first Q3 at v and the first edge of the next Q3 at v are both among the three edges of the respective cubes incident to v. If both cubes are anchored at v, those three edges are monochromatic in each cube, so the boundary switch occurs if and only if the two star colors at v differ, irrespective of how the minimal‑change geodesic is chosen inside each cube. The anchored disagreement probability used at the boundary therefore depends only on star colors and is exactly the ratio already computed in Lemma F.\\n- The suggestion to prove a uniform improvement 1/2 − R(x) ≥ c·T with c>2 “for all t” is false. Since T=1/4 at x∈{0,1}, the left side equals 1/2 there, so any c>2 would force 1/2 ≥ c/4 > 1/2. Thus the best uniform constant is c=2, which is attained at the endpoints and at balance. One can get larger coefficients only on restricted ranges of |t| (local inequalities), not uniformly.\\n\\nOn bookkeeping: the ordered/unordered distinction for disjoint pairs is harmless here because the anchored disagreement probability is a ratio symmetric in the two cubes; still, it’s good to note explicitly that the conditional law at a boundary is the uniform law on ordered disjoint pairs, and conditioning on both being anchored then yields the uniform law over ordered anchored–anchored pairs.\\n\\nI recommend adding two items to output.md: (i) the exact anchored‑drop inequality (with a one‑line proof), and (ii) the global anchored‑savings proposition with the stated corollary. These are rigorous, self‑contained, and build directly on the already‑curated ingredients. This constitutes a concrete, publication‑grade step.\\n\\nNext steps:\\n- Balanced‑degree regime: push b ≤ 1/2 − γ via an LP/SDP using marked‑Q3 types at a vertex (with f1‑start color), 4‑cycle consistency, and Dvořák’s badness constraints. Begin by enumerating isomorphism classes of 2‑colorings of Q3 with a marked vertex, classify good/bad, and, for good, record the f1‑start color at the mark.\\n- Complementary refinement using u_v: leverage Corollary D to bound the both‑good boundary switch probability by 1/2 − (1/2)·E_v[u_v^2], with proper weighting by the both‑good mass at v (handled via Lemma E0). This may yield savings even when E_v[T_v]≈0.\\n- Optional but safe sharpening: use the exact formula to tabulate 1/2 − R(x) versus T numerically, to derive piecewise lower bounds with c>2 on small |t| intervals (not uniform), which could improve constants in some regimes.\\n\",\"new_notes_md\":\"Anchored–anchored refinement: exact drop and global integration\\n- Notation recap at a vertex v:\\n  • r_v = red degree; x_v := r_v/n; T_v := (x_v − 1/2)^2.\\n  • τ_v := [C(r_v,3)+C(n−r_v,3)]/C(n,3), the fraction of 3‑sets anchored at v (monochromatic star at v). By Lemma B, τ_v ≥ 1/4 − 3/(4n).\\n  • For anchored–anchored pairs at v, Lemma F gives the exact conditional disagreement probability R(x) = 2x^3(1−x)^3/(x^3+(1−x)^3)^2 with x=x_v.\\n\\n- Exact universal inequality (anchored drop): for all x∈[0,1], letting y:=x(1−x) and T:=(x−1/2)^2=1/4−y,\\n  1/2 − R(x) = 1/2 − 2y^3/(1−3y)^2 ≥ 2T.\\n  Proof sketch: The inequality is equivalent to y^2 ≤ (1−3y)^2 for y∈[0,1/4], which holds with equality at y∈{0,1/4} (i.e., x∈{0,1/2,1}). Thus the drop below 1/2 is at least 2T, uniformly and sharply.\\n\\n- Boundary interpretation without extra tie‑breaking: At a boundary vertex v between consecutive blocks, the last edge of the preceding Q3 and the first edge of the next Q3 are both incident to v. If both cubes are anchored at v, then each of these edges must have its cube’s star color at v. Hence the boundary switch occurs if and only if the two star colors at v differ. Therefore, conditional on both cubes being anchored at v, the boundary switch probability equals the anchored disagreement probability R(x_v) from Lemma F. No special tie‑breaking is needed in anchored cubes for this conclusion.\\n\\n- Global anchored savings (informal summary): For each boundary, Dvořák’s baseline bound is b/2 + a/2. On the subevent that both neighboring Q3’s are anchored at the shared vertex v, this both‑good term improves from 1/2 to R(x_v), saving (1/2 − R(x_v)) ≥ 2T_v. The probability that both are anchored at v equals τ_v^2 ± O(1/n) by Lemma E0 (membership under disjointness). Averaging v uniformly across boundaries (Proposition G) and summing over ~n/3 boundaries yields a net reduction of at least (2/3)·E_v[τ_v^2 T_v]·n − o(n). Consequently,\\n  E[switches] ≤ (1/3 + b/12)·n − (2/3)·E_v[τ_v^2 T_v]·n + o(n),\\n  and since τ_v^2 ≥ 1/16 − O(1/n) pointwise, an unconditional corollary is\\n  E[switches] ≤ (1/3 + b/12 − (1/24)·E_v[T_v] + o(1))·n.\\n\\n- Limits and focus: The anchored‑driven gain vanishes in the balanced regime (T_v≈0). To improve the universal constant, we must either (i) control b strictly below 1/2 in the balanced case via local consistency (4‑cycles, marked‑Q3 types), or (ii) derive complementary both‑good savings using the bias parameter u_v from Corollary D with proper weighting.\\n\\n- Caution: A uniform inequality 1/2 − R(x) ≥ c·T with c>2 is impossible (it fails at x∈{0,1}). Larger coefficients are attainable only on restricted |t| ranges.\\n\\nConcrete next steps\\n- Enumerate marked‑Q3 isomorphism classes and determine their good/bad status and the f1‑start color at the marked vertex; set up an LP/SDP to bound b in the balanced regime, enforcing 4‑cycle consistency and Dvořák’s badness constraints.\\n- Formalize a weighted version of Corollary D at the boundary level: express the both‑good boundary switch probability as an average over v with weights ≈ density of both‑good disjoint pairs at v, and quantify the reduction 1/2 − (1/2)·E_v[u_v^2] + o(1) when u_v has variance.\\n\",\"new_notes_append\":\"True\",\"new_outputs_md\":\"Lemma I (Universal anchored-drop inequality)\\nStatement. For x∈[0,1], set t:=x−1/2, T:=t^2, y:=x(1−x), and s:=x^3+(1−x)^3=1−3y. In Lemma F, the anchored–anchored conditional disagreement probability at a vertex v with x=r_v/n equals\\n\\tR(x) = 2x^3(1−x)^3 / (x^3+(1−x)^3)^2 = 2y^3 / s^2.\\nThen, for all x,\\n\\t1/2 − R(x) ≥ 2T.\\nEquality holds at x∈{0,1/2,1}.\\n\\nProof. Since T=1/4−y and s=1−3y with y∈[0,1/4], the inequality is equivalent to\\n\\t2y^3/s^2 ≤ 2y ⇔ y^2 ≤ s^2.\\nBecause y≥0 and s≥0 on [0,1/4], this reduces to y ≤ s, i.e., y ≤ 1−3y, which is exactly y ≤ 1/4. Equality occurs at y=0 (x∈{0,1}) and y=1/4 (x=1/2). ∎\\n\\nProposition J (Global anchored savings in the boundary step)\\nSetup. Work in Dvořák’s random antipodal geodesic scheme with k:=⌊n/3⌋ blocks and boundaries j=1,…,k−1. Let a be the probability that two neighboring Q3’s are both good, and b the probability that they are of mixed type. For a vertex v, let r_v be its red degree, x_v:=r_v/n, T_v:=(x_v−1/2)^2, and\\n\\tτ_v := [C(r_v,3)+C(n−r_v,3)]/C(n,3).\\nFor boundary j, let v:=v_{3j} denote the shared boundary vertex, and let A_j be the event that both neighboring Q3’s at boundary j are anchored at v (i.e., each has a monochromatic 3‑star at v in its three directions).\\n\\nStatement. For either of Dvořák’s choices f∈{f1,f2}, the boundary‑switch probability satisfies\\n\\tP[switch at boundary j] ≤ b/2 + a/2 − E[ 1_{A_j} · (1/2 − R(x_v)) ] + o(1),\\nwhere the expectation is over the randomness of the geodesic scheme and the boundary index j, v=v_{3j} is the shared boundary vertex, and R is as in Lemma I. Consequently,\\n\\tE[switches] ≤ (1/3 + b/12)·n − (2/3)·E_v[ τ_v^2 · T_v ]·n + o(n).\\n\\nProof. The baseline bound P[switch at a boundary] ≤ b/2 + a/2 + o(1) is Dvořák’s, with o(1) from negligible pairs sharing more than one vertex. On the subevent A_j, the boundary switch occurs if and only if the two star colors at v differ, because the last edge of the j‑th block and the first edge of the (j+1)‑st block are both incident to v, and in an anchored cube the three edges at v are monochromatic. Conditioned on A_j and v, the two 3‑sets of directions flanking the boundary are uniformly distributed among all ordered disjoint anchored triples at v, so the conditional disagreement probability equals R(x_v) by Lemma F. Therefore, on A_j the both‑good contribution (bounded by 1/2 in the baseline) drops by (1/2 − R(x_v)). On the event that both cubes are good but A_j fails, we keep the crude 1/2 bound. This proves the displayed inequality.\\n\\nBy Proposition G, v=v_{3j} is uniformly distributed over V(Q_n) for each j. By Lemma E0 (membership under disjointness), P[A_j | v] = τ_v^2 ± O(1/n). Combining with Lemma I (which gives 1/2 − R(x_v) ≥ 2T_v) yields\\n\\tE[ 1_{A_j} · (1/2 − R(x_v)) ] ≥ E_v[ (τ_v^2 − O(1/n)) · 2T_v ] = 2·E_v[τ_v^2 T_v] − O(1/n).\\nSumming the boundary‑level inequality over the k−1 = Θ(n) boundaries and adding the (unchanged) interior contribution 1 − p/2 per block (with p = a + b/2) gives\\n\\tE[switches] ≤ (1/3 + b/12)·n − (2/3)·E_v[τ_v^2 T_v]·n + o(n).\\n∎\\n\\nCorollary J1 (Explicit unconditional gain under degree variance)\\nStatement. With notation as above,\\n\\tE[switches] ≤ (1/3 + b/12 − (1/24)·E_v[T_v] + o(1))·n.\\n\\nProof. Lemma B gives τ_v ≥ 1/4 − 3/(4n) pointwise, hence τ_v^2 ≥ 1/16 − O(1/n). Since T_v ≥ 0, E_v[τ_v^2 T_v] ≥ (1/16 − O(1/n))·E_v[T_v]. Substitute into Proposition J. ∎\\n\\nRemark. The inequality in Lemma I is sharp at x∈{0,1/2,1}; therefore the constant 2 multiplying T is the best possible uniform constant. Larger constants are attainable only on restricted ranges of |x−1/2| (not uniformly over x∈[0,1]).\",\"new_outputs_append\":\"True\",\"verdict\":\"partial success\"}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"auto","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"VerifierNewSchema","schema_":{"properties":{"feedback_md":{"title":"Feedback Md","type":"string"},"new_notes_md":{"title":"New Notes Md","type":"string"},"new_notes_append":{"title":"New Notes Append","type":"string"},"new_outputs_md":{"title":"New Outputs Md","type":"string"},"new_outputs_append":{"title":"New Outputs Append","type":"string"},"verdict":{"title":"Verdict","type":"string"}},"required":["feedback_md","new_notes_md","new_notes_append","new_outputs_md","new_outputs_append","verdict"],"title":"VerifierNewSchema","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":14263,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":16300,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":13056},"total_tokens":30563},"user":null,"store":true}
