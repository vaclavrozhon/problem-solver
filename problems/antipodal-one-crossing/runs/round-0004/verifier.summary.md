Overall, both reports make substantial, coherent progress on the anchored–anchored refinement of the both‑good boundary term, and they slot cleanly into the framework already curated in output.md (Lemmas E0, F, Proposition G). The key algebraic inequality 1/2 − R(x) ≥ 2T (where R(x)=2x^3(1−x)^3/(x^3+(1−x)^3)^2 and T=(x−1/2)^2) is correct, sharp at x∈{0,1/2,1}, and removes the need for small‑t expansions. The proposed global integration (subtracting the anchored savings from the both‑good boundary contribution) is also sound and, after averaging the shared boundary vertex using Proposition G and using Lemma E0 to handle the disjointness conditioning, yields a rigorous improvement of order (2/3)·E_v[τ_v^2 T_v]·n, and hence the simple corollary with constant 1/24 multiplying E_v[T_v].
