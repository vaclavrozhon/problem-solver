  "progress_md": "## Round 0005 \n\nTo continue our exploration into improving Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's 3/8 bound on color changes in the $n$-cube, we'll refine our strategies based on the verifier's feedback and the insights gained in previous rounds. Our focus will remain on the expander vs. sparse-cut dichotomy and the potential for a $Q_3$ density improvement, but with an emphasis on developing more concrete examples, candidate lemmas, and identifying potential obstacles. Here's a detailed mini-plan for this round:\n\n### Mini-plan\n- **Develop Small Examples**: Construct small-scale examples to illustrate the principles behind the expander vs. sparse-cut dichotomy and the $Q_3$ density hypothesis.\n- **Formulate Candidate Lemmas**: Based on these examples, propose candidate lemmas that could support an improvement on the 3/8 bound.\n- **Identify Obstacles**: Anticipate potential obstacles in proving these lemmas or in applying them to the broader problem.\n- **Plan Next Moves**: Outline steps to overcome these obstacles and further refine our approach.\n\n### Small Examples\nTo better understand the expander vs. sparse-cut dichotomy, consider a small cube where each block's color distribution can be easily visualized. Similarly, for the $Q_3$ density improvement, a small model where 'good' and 'bad' $Q_3$ subcubes are explicitly identified could help in conceptualizing how a density improvement might be achieved.\n\n### Candidate Lemmas\nBased on the small examples, we might propose a lemma stating that for any given partition of the cube into sufficiently large blocks, the presence of a majority color in a significant fraction of the blocks implies a lower overall number of switches needed for an antipodal path.\n\n### Obstacles\nOne major obstacle could be proving that these local properties (block-wise color majority or 'good' $Q_3$ density) scale to the entire cube in a way that impacts the global number of switches.\n\n### Next Moves\nTo address these obstacles, we could look into more sophisticated combinatorial techniques or probabilistic methods that might offer a more global perspective on the cube's color distribution and path properties.",
