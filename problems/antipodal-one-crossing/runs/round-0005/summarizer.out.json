Prover-01 introduced Proposition G2 (boundary 3-set pair uniformity independent of the shared vertex), Proposition K (both-good boundary refinement via u_v giving a saving \u2265 (1/6)\u00b7E_v[\u03c4_v^2\u00b7u_v^2]\u00b7n and hence \u2265 (1/96)\u00b7E_v[u_v^2]\u00b7n), and an exact closed form for the anchored drop 1/2\u2212R(x)=2T(9+24T+16T^2)/(1+24T+144T^2) with small\u2011T amplifications. Prover-02 supplied the same uniformity lemma, explicit finite\u2011n constants for Lemma E0 (|S_K|=(9n^2\u221245n+60)/6 \u21d2 error \u226410/(n\u221212)), and a finite\u2011n coefficient c(n)=(2/3)\u00b7\u03c4_min^2\u21921/24 that sharpens Proposition J. Both provers laid out the LP/enumeration plan to attack the remaining near\u2011balanced regime. Verifier verdict: partial success. Citations: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json.",
