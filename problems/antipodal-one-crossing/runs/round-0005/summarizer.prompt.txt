## Round 0005 — Complementary both-good refinement via u_v; boundary pair uniformity; and a sharper expression for the anchored drop

Audit of output.md (gaps/clarifications)
- The newly curated Lemma I and Proposition J look correct; the anchored-drop inequality is exact and the global integration is sound. The “tie-breaking” remark is no longer needed in anchored cubes (as noted in verifier feedback and also in notes.md): in an anchored Q3, all three edges at the shared vertex have the star color, so the boundary switch occurs iff the two star colors at the shared vertex differ, independently of how the minimal-change geodesics are fixed within each cube. No action needed beyond perhaps a clarifying sentence (already reflected in notes.md).
- One small-but-useful missing ingredient: an explicit statement that, at any fixed boundary j, the ordered pair of 3-sets (K_j,K_{j+1}) of directions defining the two neighbor Q3’s is uniform over all ordered disjoint 3-sets and independent of the shared boundary vertex v_{3j}. This uniformity is implicitly used when invoking Lemma E0/Lemma C at boundaries. I provide a clean proposition and proof below; adding it would make the conditioning steps in J/D-level refinements fully transparent.
- Opportunity for a complementary both-good refinement (beyond anchored): we can use Corollary D’s u_v-parameter directly for the both-good case at the boundary. This yields an independent and rigorous saving term ≥ (1/6)·E_v[τ_v^2·u_v^2]·n, which in turn gives a very clean corollary ≥ (1/96)·E_v[u_v^2]·n using τ_v ≥ 1/4 − O(1/n). This covers regimes where degree variance T_v is small but u_v retains variance due to non-anchored good cubes.

New, checkable propositions/lemmas (to add)

1) Proposition G2 (Uniform pair-of-block directions at a boundary and independence from v)
- Statement. In Dvořák’s random-permutation model, fix j∈{1,…,⌊n/3⌋−1}. Then the ordered pair (K_j,K_{j+1}) of 3-sets of directions used in blocks j and j+1 is uniformly distributed over all ordered disjoint pairs from C([n],3), and is independent of the shared boundary vertex v_{3j}.
- Proof. Let π be a uniform random permutation of [n], decomposed into 3-blocks (K_1,…,K_k) of consecutive 3 positions. For any ordered disjoint pair (A,B) of 3-sets, the number of π with K_j=A and K_{j+1}=B equals 3!·3!·(n−6)! (arrangements of A and B inside the 6 fixed slots, and permutations of remaining coordinates), independent of (A,B), hence (K_j,K_{j+1}) is uniform among ordered disjoint pairs. The boundary vertex v_{3j}=v_0⊕(⊕_{i≤3j}e_{π(i)}) depends only on v_0 and the earlier blocks (K_1,…,K_{j−1}), while (K_j,K_{j+1}) depends only on positions 3j−2,…,3j+3 in π. Under a uniform permutation, these parts are independent; v_0 is also independent. Hence (K_j,K_{j+1}) is independent of v_{3j}. ∎

2) Proposition K (Both-good boundary refinement via u_v)
- Setup. For a vertex v, let G_v⊆C([n],3) be good triples; define c_v:G_v→{R,B} as in Corollary D (first-edge color at v under f1 in a good Q3). Let u_v:=|2p_v−1| with p_v the c_v-red fraction. Let q_v be the boundary-level probability (under Dvořák’s random geodesic) that the two neighboring Q3’s at a boundary share vertex v and are both good.
- Statement. In Dvořák’s scheme, the both-good contribution at a boundary satisfies
  E[1_{both-good}·1_{switch at boundary}] = (a/2) − (1/2)·E_v[q_v·u_v^2] ± o(1).
  Consequently,
  E[switches] ≤ (1/3 + b/12)·n − (1/6)·E_v[q_v·u_v^2]·n + o(n).
  In particular, since q_v ≥ τ_v^2 − O(1/n) (anchored ⇒ good and Lemma E0),
  E[switches] ≤ (1/3 + b/12)·n − (1/6)·E_v[τ_v^2·u_v^2]·n + o(n)
  ≤ (1/3 + b/12 − (1/96)·E_v[u_v^2] + o(1))·n.
- Proof. Fix a boundary j and condition on the shared vertex v=v_{3j}. By Proposition G2, the ordered pair (K,L) of direction-sets is uniform over ordered disjoint pairs and independent of v. Condition further on “both good at v”: then (K,L) is uniform over ordered disjoint pairs in G_v. By Lemma C with T=G_v, we have P[c_v(K)≠c_v(L)] = 1/2 − u_v^2/2 ± O(1/n). Thus, conditioning on v, the both-good boundary switch probability equals q_v·(1/2 − u_v^2/2) ± O(1/n). Averaging v uniformly (Proposition G) and using E_v[q_v]=a (definition of a) yields the first displayed equality. Summing over ≈n/3 boundaries and adding the interior contribution 1 − p/2 per block gives the global inequality. The bound q_v ≥ τ_v^2 − O(1/n) follows since “anchored at v ⇒ good” and the probability of both anchored equals τ_v^2 ± O(1/n) by Lemma E0. Using τ_v ≥ 1/4 − O(1/n) gives the explicit 1/96 constant in the final corollary. ∎
- Why useful here. This yields a second, independent source of both-good savings that applies even when T_v is tiny. It converts vertex-level imbalance among preferred colors inside good Q3’s (u_v) into a linear-in-n gain.

3) Exact closed form and piecewise improvements for the anchored drop
- Exact expression. With T=(r_v/n − 1/2)^2 and R(x) as in Lemma I, one can write
  1/2 − R(x) = 2T · (9 + 24T + 16T^2)/(1 + 24T + 144T^2).
  Proof. Compute Q(T):=(1/4+3T)^2 − 4(1/4−T)^3 = (1/4)·T·(9 + 24T + 16T^2) and divide by 2(1/4+3T)^2.
- Consequences (auditable polynomial bounds):
  • Uniform inequality (Lemma I) re-proved: since (9 + 24T + 16T^2) ≥ (1 + 24T + 144T^2) for T∈[0,1/4], the ratio ≥1, giving 1/2 − R(x) ≥ 2T.
  • Small-T amplification. For any c∈(2,18), the inequality 1/2 − R(x) ≥ c·T holds for all T in [0,T_c], where T_c is the smallest positive root of (9 + 24T + 16T^2) − c(1 + 24T + 144T^2) ≥ 0. Two explicit instances:
    – c=6: inequality holds for T ≤ T_6 = (−24 + √3072)/416 ≈ 0.0755.
    – c=10: inequality holds for T ≤ T_10 = (−96 + √20480)/1408 ≈ 0.0335.
  These piecewise bounds can slightly improve constants in regimes with very small degree variance at many vertices.

How these pieces fit the overall plan
- We now have two rigorous, vertex-averaged savings for the both-good boundary term:
  • Anchored route (Proposition J): saving ≥ (2/3)·E_v[τ_v^2·T_v]·n.
  • u_v route (Proposition K): saving ≥ (1/6)·E_v[τ_v^2·u_v^2]·n.
  Either bound applies; in analysis we may take their maximum to get the strongest available improvement in a given instance. The anchored route is effective when degree variance is present; the u_v route can kick in even when degrees are nearly balanced but the good-Q3 preferred-color labels exhibit variance.
- The remaining hard regime remains: both T_v and u_v^2 concentrated near 0. There we must drive b ≤ 1/2 − γ by local consistency across 4-cycles and Q3-types.

Balanced-regime program for b (LP/SDP next steps, concrete)
- Variables at a vertex v with r_v=n/2 (symmetric case):
  1) 4-cycle type frequencies y_t (four isomorphism classes: monochromatic; two-adjacent; two-opposite; alternating).
  2) Marked-Q3 type frequencies z_π over isomorphism classes of 2-colored Q3 with a marked vertex v, tagged as good/bad (by Dvořák’s definition), and for good classes, the f1-start color at v.
  3) Pair variables for disjoint triples at v (linearized via standard product-to-new-variable trick), to express b_v.
- Constraints:
  • Normalization and marginalization from z_π to y_t and to star types at v.
  • 4-cycle consistency across the four marked Q3’s sharing a fixed 4-cycle through v.
  • Badness filters (Lemma 9) enforced at v and the opposite vertex of the marked cube.
  • Symmetry under color swap and S_n on coordinates; balanced degree r_v=n/2.
- Objective: maximize b_v (good–bad fraction among disjoint pairs). Any universal optimum < 1/2 yields γ>0. Enumerating the marked-Q3 classes is a finite task; a small script can produce the table of classes, their good/bad status, and f1-start colors.

Examples and sanity checks
- Random coloring (each edge red w.p. 1/2): heuristically u_v≈0 and T_v≈0, so both anchored- and u_v-routes give negligible savings, matching the intuition that average-case colorings are not the obstruction.
- Degree-biased coloring with x_v≡1/2+0.1 over a positive fraction of vertices: T_v=0.01; anchored drop per boundary ≥ 2T_v=0.02, scaled by τ_v^2≈(1/4)^2 gives ≳0.00125 per boundary, i.e., ≳0.00042·n total saving—consistent with Proposition J.

Next steps (auditable deliverables)
1) Curate Proposition G2 and Proposition K (with their short proofs) into output.md. They are self-contained and rely on already-curated Lemma C/E0 and Proposition G.
2) Optionally add the exact closed form 1/2 − R(x) = 2T·(9 + 24T + 16T^2)/(1 + 24T + 144T^2) with the two small-T corollaries.
3) Begin the balanced-regime LP: enumerate marked-Q3 2-coloring classes, tag good/bad and f1-start color at the mark; encode constraints and solve numerically. Report either a positive gap γ or an extremal local distribution to analyze combinatorially.

Explicitly flagged open points
- We still lack a universal lower bound on E_v[u_v^2] or E_v[T_v]. The only remaining route to a constant δ is to show b ≤ 1/2 − γ in the near-balanced regime via the LP/SDP or new structural lemmas.
- Discrete minimization of H(r,n) (anchored–anchored mass) at r≈n/2 is no longer needed for the core bounds (we use Lemma E0 and τ_v), but it may be added for completeness. A direct sign analysis of H(r+1,n)−H(r,n), using F(m)=C(m,3)C(m−3,3), should work; I can supply a proof if desired.

## Round 0005 — Firming up boundary sampling; explicit constants in the disjointness error; and a concrete LP blueprint for the balanced regime

### Quick audit of output.md (minor gaps and clarifications)
- Proposition J (global anchored savings) is sound. One minor sampling detail worth adding explicitly: at a random boundary, the ordered pair of 3-sets of directions flanking the boundary is uniform over all ordered disjoint pairs. This is implicitly used when applying Lemma E0; it is true by symmetry of the random permutation and block partition. I state this as Lemma K below for completeness.
- Lemma E0 (membership under disjointness) is used with an O(1/n) term. We can make the constant explicit by computing |S_K| exactly (see “Explicit constants for Lemma E0”). This will clarify error bookkeeping in Proposition J and Corollary J1.
- The present anchored-driven bound is already optimal in the sense that the coefficient 2 in Lemma I cannot be globally improved (as noted). Thus the only remaining obstruction to beating 3/8 unconditionally is the near-balanced regime where E_v[T_v]≈0. The LP/SDP program for b is the most promising next step.

### New, small, checkable lemmas and refinements

1) Lemma K (Uniformity of boundary 3-set pairs)
- Statement. Under Dvořák’s scheme with a uniform random permutation π of [n], partition [n] into contiguous 3-blocks B_1,…,B_k with B_j={π_{3j-2},π_{3j-1},π_{3j}}. Choose boundary j uniformly from {1,…,k−1}. Then the ordered pair (K,L):=(B_j,B_{j+1}) is uniformly distributed over all ordered pairs of disjoint 3-sets of [n].
- Proof idea. A random partition into k ordered blocks of size 3 is generated by the random permutation. Conditional on the partition, each B_j is a uniform 3-subset; conditioning further on B_j=K, the next block B_{j+1} is a uniform 3-subset of the remaining [n] \ K. Hence (K,L) is uniform among ordered disjoint pairs.
- Why useful here. It justifies the use of Lemma E0 (and Lemma F) at boundaries without additional averaging arguments.

2) Explicit constants for Lemma E0 (tight O(1/n) bound)
- Exact |S_K|. For a fixed 3-set K⊆[n], the number of 3-sets intersecting K equals |S_K| = C(n,3) − C(n−3,3) = (9n^2 − 45n + 60)/6 = (3/2)n^2 − (15/2)n + 10.
- Consequently, for any T⊆C([n],3) with |T|=τ·C(n,3) and a uniformly random ordered pair (K,L) of disjoint triples,
  |P[K∈T,L∈T] − τ^2| ≤ max_K |ε(K)| ≤ |S_K|/C(n−3,3)
  = (9n^2 − 45n + 60)/(n^3 − 12n^2 + 47n − 60) ≤ 10/(n−12) for all n≥20.
- Practical corollary. One may replace the O(1/n) in Lemma E0, Proposition J, and Corollary J1 by a concrete ≤ 10/(n−12), making all constants explicit (useful if we later optimize finite-n constants).

3) Finite-n constant in Proposition J (explicit c(n))
- Using Lemma B exactly, for even n we have τ_min = 2·C(n/2,3)/C(n,3); for odd n, τ_min = [C((n−1)/2,3)+C((n+1)/2,3)]/C(n,3).
- Hence Proposition J yields
  E[switches] ≤ (1/3 + b/12)·n − c(n)·E_v[T_v]·n + O(1),
  with c(n) = (2/3)·(τ_min)^2. In particular, c(n) → 1/24 as n→∞ and c(n) ≥ (1/24)·(1 − O(1/n)). This sharpens Corollary J1’s asymptotic statement to a finite‑n bound with an explicit coefficient.

### Discrete minimization of H(r,n) (status and plan)
- Claim (to be proved). For all n≥8, H(r,n) from Lemma F is minimized at r∈{⌊n/2⌋,⌈n/2⌉}.
- Sketch of approach. Write A(m)=C(m,3), and note H’s numerator equals A(r)A(r−3) + 2A(r)A(n−r) + A(n−r)A(n−r−3). Consider Δ(r)=Num(r+1)−Num(r) and show it changes sign exactly once at ⌊n/2⌋. The leading terms form a convex, symmetric polynomial in r (by asymptotics A(r)≈r^3/6), and small lower‑order corrections (the ±3 shifts) do not alter the location of the discrete minimizer for n≥8. I will carry out the exact discrete difference algebra next round.
- Why still useful. While Proposition J no longer relies on H(r,n), the minimization of H underpins optional anchored‑mass refinements and serves as an internal consistency check for our anchored estimates.

### Toward the balanced‑degree regime: an LP blueprint for bounding b
We now formalize a tractable LP in the symmetric (balanced-degree) regime r_v≡n/2, isolating local statistics at a fixed vertex v. The objective is to upper‑bound b_v (fraction of mixed edges across the cut (G_v, its complement) in KG(n,3)) under local consistency and Dvořák-style “badness” constraints; then average over v to bound b.

- Variables (at a fixed v):
  1) Star-type frequencies on 3-sets K: s_{3R}, s_{2R1B}, s_{1R2B}, s_{3B}. Balanced degrees impose s_{3R}=s_{3B}=τ (fixed by Lemma B) and s_{2R1B}=s_{1R2B}=(1−2τ)/2.
  2) 4-cycle-type frequencies y_t over unordered pairs {i,j}, where t∈{mono, two-adjacent, two-opposite, alternating}. Marginals must match the color-pair distribution at v: in the balanced case,
     y_mono + y_adjacent = P[RR]+P[BB] = C(n/2,2)/C(n,2) + C(n/2,2)/C(n,2) = 1/2,
     y_opposite + y_alternating = P[RB] = 1/2.
  3) Marked-Q3 pattern frequencies z_π over 2-colored Q3’s with a marked vertex v (up to Aut(Q3) with a mark), tagged as good/bad (per Dvořák) and, for good, the color chosen by f1 on the first edge at v. Each class π has an integer triple (a_π,b_π,c_π) counting how many of the three faces at v fall into each 4-cycle type; these induce linear constraints linking {z_π} to {y_t} and to the star types s_{·}.
  4) Pair variables for disjoint triples (K,L) that are v-neighbors. As in Lemma C/E0, the law over disjoint pairs is within O(1/n) of the product of the marginals. We thus linearize b_v by approximating the disjoint-pair distribution with the product distribution over K and L, adding a conservative ±O(1/n) slack in the constraints to absorb the dependency.

- Constraints:
  • Normalization: ∑_π z_π = 1; star/face marginals of the z_π equal s_{·}, y_{·}.
  • Dvořák badness filter: z_π=0 for patterns π violating Lemma 9’s characterization (i.e., bad Q3’s must admit antipodal geodesics from v with exactly one color change with prescribed endpoint colors; anchored classes are good by Lemma 8).
  • Symmetry under color swap: coupled with balance, this halves the variable set (e.g., s_{3R}=s_{3B}, s_{2R1B}=s_{1R2B}; likewise for z_π in color-swapped pairs).
  • Disjoint-pair linearization: the mixed mass b_v is a linear form in pair frequencies over (π,σ); we enforce upper bounds using the product-approximation and add an explicit O(1/n) slack (from Lemma E0) so the LP upper bound remains valid for finite n.

- Objective: Maximize b_v subject to the above constraints. Any universal optimum strictly below 1/2 (for n large) gives the desired γ>0 in b ≤ 1/2 − γ, certifying a constant improvement over 3/8 in the balanced regime.

- Why plausible: The inclusion of all anchored classes in “good”, together with 4-cycle consistency across the three faces at v in each Q3, should constrain the cut (G_v, ¯G_v) well below the vertexwise spectral MAX-CUT bound (which ignores such structure). Even a modest LP margin γ≈10^{-3} would suffice.

- Enumerative input (next deliverable): Provide the list of marked-Q3 isomorphism classes, their good/bad status, and (for good) the f1-start color at v. For each class, tabulate the triple (a_π,b_π,c_π) of face-types at v. This table pins down the linear map z_π ↦ (s_{·}, y_{·}).

### Small examples and sanity checks
- “One-direction dictatorial” Q3 (bad): all edges in one direction red, the other two directions blue. At any v, the star has type 1R2B or 2R1B depending on which of the three directions incident to v is the “red” one. Its three faces at v are: one monochrome (from the blue–blue pair), and two alternating (from the red–blue pairs). This pattern exactly matches Lemma 9’s behavior and will be an extremal bad class in the enumeration.
- Balanced-degree vertex: star-type frequencies over K computed directly are s_{3R}=s_{3B}=1/4 + O(1/n) and s_{2R1B}=s_{1R2B}=3/8 + O(1/n), consistent with Lemma B. The pair-of-edges at v over unordered {i,j} satisfy P[RR]=P[BB]=1/4, P[RB]=1/2, thus y_mono + y_adj=1/2 and y_alt + y_opposite=1/2 must hold in any feasible assignment.

### Obstacles and why previous routes fail here
- Anchored refinement cannot help in the balanced regime: τ_v hits its minimum and T_v≈0, so Proposition J yields no gain. Any further both-good refinement via u_v must overcome the adversary’s freedom to balance c_v within good classes, which may be possible in pathological colorings.
- Vertexwise Kneser-G cut bounds alone cannot beat 1/2: The spectral MAX-CUT gives b_v ≤ 1/2 + O(1/n), and without injecting cube-specific structure (anchored inclusion, 4-cycle consistency, badness filter) no universal γ>0 emerges.

### Concrete next steps (auditable)
1) Add Lemma K to output.md (uniformity of boundary 3-set pairs), with the short proof above.
2) Replace the O(1/n) in Lemma E0, Proposition J, and related corollaries by the explicit bound ≤ 10/(n−12), citing the exact |S_K| and C(n−3,3) formulae. This makes all finite‑n constants explicit.
3) Complete the discrete proof that H(r,n) is minimized at r≈n/2 for n≥8 (sign change of Δ(r)=Num(r+1)−Num(r)). Although not needed for Proposition J, it settles a standing claim from earlier rounds and may be reused in anchored‑mass refinements.
4) Begin the LP in the balanced regime:
   - Enumerate marked-Q3 classes up to Aut(Q3) with a mark; classify good/bad; for good, record f1-start color at v.
   - For each class, compute the triple (a_π,b_π,c_π) of face types at v among {mono, adj, opp, alt}.
   - Encode the LP (z_π variables; constraints to (s_{·}, y_{·}); product-linearization for b_v with ±10/(n−12) slack) and solve numerically for large n (treating asymptotic constraints). Any γ>0 will guide the ensuing combinatorial proof.

### Why this advances the program
- The new Lemma K closes a small but real sampling gap in Proposition J’s proof. The explicit constants for Lemma E0 strengthen all o(1) terms into precise O(1/n) with known coefficients, improving auditability.
- The LP blueprint isolates exactly which local statistics must be controlled to push b below 1/2 in the balanced regime. This is the remaining obstruction to a universal improvement below 3/8; each ingredient is finite, computable, and checkable.

### Explicitly flagged gaps (to be addressed)
- output.md does not yet contain Lemma K; add it.
- The finite‑n constant c(n) in Proposition J is not yet stated explicitly; add the formula c(n)=(2/3)·(τ_min)^2 with τ_min from Lemma B.
- The discrete minimization of H(r,n) remains unproven; I will supply a complete discrete argument next round.
