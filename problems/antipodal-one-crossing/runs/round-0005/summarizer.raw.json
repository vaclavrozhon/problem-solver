Prover-01 introduced Proposition G2 (boundary 3-set pair uniformity independent of the shared vertex), Proposition K (both-good boundary refinement via u_v giving a saving ≥ (1/6)·E_v[τ_v^2·u_v^2]·n and hence ≥ (1/96)·E_v[u_v^2]·n), and an exact closed form for the anchored drop 1/2−R(x)=2T(9+24T+16T^2)/(1+24T+144T^2) with small‑T amplifications. Prover-02 supplied the same uniformity lemma, explicit finite‑n constants for Lemma E0 (|S_K|=(9n^2−45n+60)/6 ⇒ error ≤10/(n−12)), and a finite‑n coefficient c(n)=(2/3)·τ_min^2→1/24 that sharpens Proposition J. Both provers laid out the LP/enumeration plan to attack the remaining near‑balanced regime. Verifier verdict: partial success.
