  "summary_md": "Round 0005 produced complementary, checkable refinements and a concrete LP blueprint. Prover-01 introduced Proposition G2 (boundary 3-set pair uniformity independent of the shared vertex), Proposition K (both-good boundary refinement via u_v giving a saving ≥ (1/6)·E_v[τ_v^2·u_v^2]·n and hence ≥ (1/96)·E_v[u_v^2]·n), and an exact closed form for the anchored drop 1/2−R(x)=2T(9+24T+16T^2)/(1+24T+144T^2) with small‑T amplifications. Prover-02 supplied the same uniformity lemma, explicit finite‑n constants for Lemma E0 (|S_K|=(9n^2−45n+60)/6 ⇒ error ≤10/(n−12)), and a finite‑n coefficient c(n)=(2/3)·τ_min^2→1/24 that sharpens Proposition J. Both provers laid out the LP/enumeration plan to attack the remaining near‑balanced regime. Verifier verdict: partial success. Citations: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json.",

    "Both-good u_v refinement (Proposition K): conditional both-good boundary switch probability = 1/2 − u_v^2/2, giving a global saving ≥ (1/6)·E_v[τ_v^2·u_v^2]·n and thus ≥ (1/96)·E_v[u_v^2]·n by τ_v ≥ 1/4 − O(1/n).",
    "Exact anchored-drop closed form: 1/2 − R(x) = 2T·(9 + 24T + 16T^2)/(1 + 24T + 144T^2), with small-T amplification bounds (e.g. c=6 valid to T≈0.0755; c=10 valid to T≈0.0335).",
    "Finite-n explicit error for disjointness (Lemma E0): |S_K| = (9n^2 − 45n + 60)/6, yielding an explicit bound ≤ 10/(n−12) for the O(1/n) terms (n≥20).",
    "Finite-n anchored saving coefficient in Proposition J: c(n) = (2/3)·(τ_min)^2 (→ 1/24), so E[switches] ≤ (1/3 + b/12)·n − c(n)·E_v[T_v]·n + O(1) with explicit c(n).",
