  "feedback_md": "Overall both reports contain good, auditable advances. The boundary sampling uniformity (pair of 3-sets across a boundary) is correct and should be added explicitly; it closes a small gap that we were implicitly using. The anchored-drop closed form is a clean identity and the \u201csmall\u2011T\u201d piecewise bounds follow by elementary polynomial inequalities. The explicit finite\u2011n constant in the disjointness lemma (E0) is also valuable, but the bound quoted by Prover 02 is missing a factor 2 in the worst\u2011case perturbation; see below for a corrected explicit inequality.\n\nMain points by item:\n- Uniformity of (K_j,K_{j+1}) and independence from v_{3j}: The proof via random permutation counting is correct. We will add this as a new lemma (your Proposition G2 / Lemma K). It justifies conditioning on the shared boundary vertex without bias in the pair of direction\u2011blocks.\n- Explicit constants for Lemma E0: The computation |S_K| = C(n,3) \u2212 C(n\u22123,3) = (9n^2 \u2212 45n + 60)/6 is correct. However, when converting to a bound on |P[K,L\u2208T] \u2212 \u03c4^2|, a careful algebra gives an extra factor 2: |( |T| \u2212 |T\u2229S_K|)/(M \u2212 |S_K|) \u2212 |T|/M| \u2264 2|S_K|/(M \u2212 |S_K|) = 2|S_K|/C(n\u22123,3). Thus an explicit bound is \u2264 2(9n^2 \u2212 45n + 60)/(n^3 \u2212 12n^2 + 47n \u2212 60) \u2264 20/(n \u2212 12) for all n \u2265 20. We add this as a rigorous corollary to Lemma E0.\n- Closed form for 1/2 \u2212 R(x): The identity 1/2 \u2212 R(x) = 2T\u00b7(9 + 24T + 16T^2)/(1 + 24T + 144T^2) is correct (we re\u2011derived it). The \u201cuniform \u22652T\u201d inequality follows immediately since (9 + 24T + 16T^2) \u2212 (1 + 24T + 144T^2) = 8(1 \u2212 16T^2) \u2265 0 on T \u2208 [0,1/4]. The small\u2011T amplification is also correct once the factor 2 is accounted for: the condition is (9 + 24T + 16T^2) \u2212 (c/2)(1 + 24T + 144T^2) \u2265 0; the two explicit thresholds quoted (c=6 and c=10) match the correct formula and numerics.\n- Proposition K (both\u2011good refinement via u_v): The high\u2011level idea is attractive, but there is a missing justification: we need that, conditioned on both neighboring cubes being good, the boundary switch at v equals the event [c_v(K) \u2260 c_v(L)], where c_v(K) is defined as the color of the first edge at v along the f1 path in Q3(v,K). This equivalence is clear in the anchored case (all three edges at v have the star color), but for general good cubes it is nontrivial: the boundary uses the last edge of block j at v and the first edge of block j+1 at v, not necessarily the \u201cfirst edge at v\u201d inside each cube per our c_v definition. Absent a proof that the boundary edge colors match the c_v labels (or that their distributions coincide so that the disagreement probability is 1/2 \u2212 u_v^2/2), we cannot yet enter Proposition K into output.md. Please either (i) redefine c_v to match the actual boundary edges and re\u2011establish Lemma C/Corollary D for that labeling, or (ii) prove a symmetry lemma that the boundary\u2011edge color at v in a good cube has the same law (and pair\u2011law under disjointness) as the \u201cfirst edge at v\u201d color.\n- Finite\u2011n constant in Proposition J: The refinement c(n) = (2/3)\u00b7(\u03c4_min)^2 is correct and worth recording. It strengthens Corollary J1 from an asymptotic O(1) to an explicit finite\u2011n coefficient.\n- Balanced\u2011regime LP blueprint: This is the right next step. The variable/constraint set described is coherent. Please proceed to enumerate the marked\u2011Q3 isomorphism classes (with marked vertex), tag good/bad, and for good record the f1 start color at the mark, as well as the triple of face types at the mark. That table will concretize the LP.\n\nConcrete next steps:\n1) We have added the boundary\u2011pair uniformity lemma and the explicit finite\u2011n bound for Lemma E0 to output.md, and we included the closed\u2011form identity for the anchored drop (with two sample small\u2011T thresholds) plus a finite\u2011n coefficient corollary to Proposition J.\n2) For the u_v route: supply a rigorous connection between boundary switch and c_v labels in the both\u2011good case (anchored is already covered). If such a connection is established, the Proposition K\u2011type saving can be formalized and added.\n3) Begin the balanced\u2011regime LP: produce the enumeration table of marked\u2011Q3 classes and the induced linear maps to star/face marginals. With that in hand we can implement and solve the LP with an explicit O(1/n) slack from the disjointness lemma.\n4) Optional: complete the discrete minimization of H(r,n); we keep it out of output.md until the proof is ready, as it is no longer a dependency for our main bounds.\n",
  "new_notes_md": "Round 0005 verification notes: boundary pair uniformity; explicit disjointness error; anchored drop closed form; and status of the u_v refinement\n\n- Boundary direction pairs are uniform and independent of the shared vertex. Fix j \u2208 {1,\u2026,\u230an/3\u230b\u22121}.

Proof: for any ordered disjoint (A,B), the number of permutations with (B_j,B_{j+1})=(A,B) equals 3!\u00b73!\u00b7(n\u22126)!, independent of (A,B).

Writing \u03c4_min as in Lemma B (even n: 2\u00b7C(n/2,3)/C(n,3); odd n: [C((n\u22121)/2,3)+C((n+1)/2,3)]/C(n,3)), Proposition J yields\n  E[switches] \u2264 (1/3 + b/12)\u00b7n \u2212 c(n)\u00b7E_v[T_v]\u00b7n + O(1), with c(n) = (2/3)\u00b7(\u03c4_min)^2.\nThus c(n)\u21921/24 and c(n) \u2265 (1/24)(1 \u2212 O(1/n)).\n\n- Status of the u_v\u2011based both\u2011good refinement. The idea: condition on the boundary shared vertex v, restrict to both\u2011good pairs (K,L) and measure the disagreement probability at v via the labels c_v(K), c_v(L), where c_v(K) is the color of the first edge at v along the f1 path inside Q3(v,K). Lemma C then gives P[c_v(K)\u2260c_v(L)] = 1/2 \u2212 u_v^2/2 \u00b1 O(1/n). However, to translate this into a boundary switch probability we must justify that, in the both\u2011good case, \u201cswitch at boundary\u201d equals (or has the same distribution as) [c_v(K)\u2260c_v(L)]. This equivalence is automatic in the anchored case (all three edges at v have the star color), but is nontrivial in general. Next step: either (i) redefine the labels to match the actual boundary edge colors (last edge of block j at v and first edge of block j+1 at v) and re\u2011prove the pair\u2011sampling lemma for those labels, or (ii) prove a symmetry lemma for good cubes showing that the boundary edge color at v has the same marginal/pair distribution as the \u201cfirst\u2011edge at v\u201d color used in c_v. Until this is established, we keep the u_v refinement as a promising conjectural route only.\n\n- Balanced\u2011regime LP blueprint (actionable). Variables: star\u2011type frequencies at v; 4\u2011cycle types through v; marked\u2011Q3 pattern frequencies (good/bad tags, and for good the f1 start color at v); linearized pair variables for disjoint triples. Constraints: normalization; marginalization from marked\u2011Q3 classes to star and 4\u2011cycle types; 4\u2011cycle consistency across faces at v; Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s badness filters; color\u2011swap and coordinate symmetries; disjoint\u2011pair product\u2011approximation with explicit \u00b120/(n\u221212) slack. Objective: maximize b_v. Any universal optimum < 1/2 (for large n) gives b \u2264 1/2 \u2212 \u03b3 and a constant improvement over 3/8 in the balanced regime.\n\nOpen items\n- Prove the equivalence (or distributional equality) needed to justify the u_v\u2011based boundary saving in the both\u2011good case.\n- Discrete minimization of H(r,n) at r\u2248n/2 (optional; not currently needed by Proposition J).\n- Enumerate marked\u2011Q3 isomorphism classes and their good/bad status and f1 start color at the mark; compute the induced face\u2011type triples to feed the LP.\n",

  "new_outputs_md": "Lemma K (Uniformity and independence of boundary direction pairs)\nStatement. In Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s random antipodal geodesic model, fix j \u2208 {1,\u2026,\u230an/3\u230b\u22121}. Let B_j = {\u03c0_{3j\u22122},\u03c0_{3j\u22121},\u03c0_{3j}} and B_{j+1} = {\u03c0_{3j+1},\u03c0_{3j+2},\u03c0_{3j+3}} be the consecutive 3\u2011blocks in the random permutation \u03c0 of [n].

Moreover, (K,L) is independent of the shared boundary vertex v_{3j}.\n\nProof. For any ordered disjoint pair (A,B) of 3\u2011sets, the number of permutations with (B_j,B_{j+1})=(A,B) equals 3!\u00b73!\u00b7(n\u22126)!, independent of (A,B). Hence (K,L) is uniform among ordered disjoint pairs.
