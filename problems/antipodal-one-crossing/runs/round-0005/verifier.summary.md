Overall both reports contain good, auditable advances. The boundary sampling uniformity (pair of 3-sets across a boundary) is correct and should be added explicitly; it closes a small gap that we were implicitly using. The anchored-drop closed form is a clean identity and the “small‑T” piecewise bounds follow by elementary polynomial inequalities. The explicit finite‑n constant in the disjointness lemma (E0) is also valuable, but the bound quoted by Prover 02 is missing a factor 2 in the worst‑case perturbation; see below for a corrected explicit inequality.
