{"feedback_md":"Overall both reports contain good, auditable advances. The boundary sampling uniformity (pair of 3-sets across a boundary) is correct and should be added explicitly; it closes a small gap that we were implicitly using. The anchored-drop closed form is a clean identity and the “small‑T” piecewise bounds follow by elementary polynomial inequalities. The explicit finite‑n constant in the disjointness lemma (E0) is also valuable, but the bound quoted by Prover 02 is missing a factor 2 in the worst‑case perturbation; see below for a corrected explicit inequality.\n\nMain points by item:\n- Uniformity of (K_j,K_{j+1}) and independence from v_{3j}: The proof via random permutation counting is correct. We will add this as a new lemma (your Proposition G2 / Lemma K). It justifies conditioning on the shared boundary vertex without bias in the pair of direction‑blocks.\n- Explicit constants for Lemma E0: The computation |S_K| = C(n,3) − C(n−3,3) = (9n^2 − 45n + 60)/6 is correct. However, when converting to a bound on |P[K,L∈T] − τ^2|, a careful algebra gives an extra factor 2: |( |T| − |T∩S_K|)/(M − |S_K|) − |T|/M| ≤ 2|S_K|/(M − |S_K|) = 2|S_K|/C(n−3,3). Thus an explicit bound is ≤ 2(9n^2 − 45n + 60)/(n^3 − 12n^2 + 47n − 60) ≤ 20/(n − 12) for all n ≥ 20. We add this as a rigorous corollary to Lemma E0.\n- Closed form for 1/2 − R(x): The identity 1/2 − R(x) = 2T·(9 + 24T + 16T^2)/(1 + 24T + 144T^2) is correct (we re‑derived it). The “uniform ≥2T” inequality follows immediately since (9 + 24T + 16T^2) − (1 + 24T + 144T^2) = 8(1 − 16T^2) ≥ 0 on T ∈ [0,1/4]. The small‑T amplification is also correct once the factor 2 is accounted for: the condition is (9 + 24T + 16T^2) − (c/2)(1 + 24T + 144T^2) ≥ 0; the two explicit thresholds quoted (c=6 and c=10) match the correct formula and numerics.\n- Proposition K (both‑good refinement via u_v): The high‑level idea is attractive, but there is a missing justification: we need that, conditioned on both neighboring cubes being good, the boundary switch at v equals the event [c_v(K) ≠ c_v(L)], where c_v(K) is defined as the color of the first edge at v along the f1 path in Q3(v,K). This equivalence is clear in the anchored case (all three edges at v have the star color), but for general good cubes it is nontrivial: the boundary uses the last edge of block j at v and the first edge of block j+1 at v, not necessarily the “first edge at v” inside each cube per our c_v definition. Absent a proof that the boundary edge colors match the c_v labels (or that their distributions coincide so that the disagreement probability is 1/2 − u_v^2/2), we cannot yet enter Proposition K into output.md. Please either (i) redefine c_v to match the actual boundary edges and re‑establish Lemma C/Corollary D for that labeling, or (ii) prove a symmetry lemma that the boundary‑edge color at v in a good cube has the same law (and pair‑law under disjointness) as the “first edge at v” color.\n- Finite‑n constant in Proposition J: The refinement c(n) = (2/3)·(τ_min)^2 is correct and worth recording. It strengthens Corollary J1 from an asymptotic O(1) to an explicit finite‑n coefficient.\n- Balanced‑regime LP blueprint: This is the right next step. The variable/constraint set described is coherent. Please proceed to enumerate the marked‑Q3 isomorphism classes (with marked vertex), tag good/bad, and for good record the f1 start color at the mark, as well as the triple of face types at the mark. That table will concretize the LP.\n\nConcrete next steps:\n1) We have added the boundary‑pair uniformity lemma and the explicit finite‑n bound for Lemma E0 to output.md, and we included the closed‑form identity for the anchored drop (with two sample small‑T thresholds) plus a finite‑n coefficient corollary to Proposition J.\n2) For the u_v route: supply a rigorous connection between boundary switch and c_v labels in the both‑good case (anchored is already covered). If such a connection is established, the Proposition K‑type saving can be formalized and added.\n3) Begin the balanced‑regime LP: produce the enumeration table of marked‑Q3 classes and the induced linear maps to star/face marginals. With that in hand we can implement and solve the LP with an explicit O(1/n) slack from the disjointness lemma.\n4) Optional: complete the discrete minimization of H(r,n); we keep it out of output.md until the proof is ready, as it is no longer a dependency for our main bounds.\n","new_notes_md":"Round 0005 verification notes: boundary pair uniformity; explicit disjointness error; anchored drop closed form; and status of the u_v refinement\n\n- Boundary direction pairs are uniform and independent of the shared vertex. Fix j ∈ {1,…,⌊n/3⌋−1}. Under a uniform permutation π and the 3‑block partition B_j={π_{3j−2},π_{3j−1},π_{3j}}, the ordered pair (K,L):=(B_j,B_{j+1}) is uniformly distributed over all ordered disjoint 3‑sets, and is independent of v_{3j}. Proof: for any ordered disjoint (A,B), the number of permutations with (B_j,B_{j+1})=(A,B) equals 3!·3!·(n−6)!, independent of (A,B). Independence from v_{3j} follows since v_{3j} depends only on earlier blocks while (B_j,B_{j+1}) depends only on positions 3j−2,…,3j+3.\n\n- Explicit finite‑n bound for Lemma E0.

With T=(r_v/n − 1/2)^2 and R(x) from Lemma I, the polynomial identity holds:\n  1/2 − R(x) = 2T · (9 + 24T + 16T^2)/(1 + 24T + 144T^2).\nConsequences:\n  • Uniform inequality (Lemma I): 1/2 − R(x) ≥ 2T, since (9 + 24T + 16T^2) ≥ (1 + 24T + 144T^2) on T∈[0,1/4].\n  • For any c ∈ (2,18), the inequality 1/2 − R(x) ≥ c·T holds for all T in [0,T_c], where T_c is the smallest positive root of (9 + 24T + 16T^2) − (c/2)(1 + 24T + 144T^2) = 0. In particular,\n    – c=6: T_6 = (−24 + √3072)/416 ≈ 0.0755.\n    – c=10: T_{10} = (−96 + √20480)/1408 ≈ 0.0335.\nThese piecewise bounds can slightly sharpen constants when many vertices have very small T_v.\n\n- Finite‑n coefficient in Proposition J. Writing τ_min as in Lemma B (even n: 2·C(n/2,3)/C(n,3); odd n: [C((n−1)/2,3)+C((n+1)/2,3)]/C(n,3)), Proposition J yields\n  E[switches] ≤ (1/3 + b/12)·n − c(n)·E_v[T_v]·n + O(1), with c(n) = (2/3)·(τ_min)^2.\nThus c(n)→1/24 and c(n) ≥ (1/24)(1 − O(1/n)).\n\n- Status of the u_v‑based both‑good refinement. The idea: condition on the boundary shared vertex v, restrict to both‑good pairs (K,L) and measure the disagreement probability at v via the labels c_v(K), c_v(L), where c_v(K) is the color of the first edge at v along the f1 path inside Q3(v,K). Lemma C then gives P[c_v(K)≠c_v(L)] = 1/2 − u_v^2/2 ± O(1/n). However, to translate this into a boundary switch probability we must justify that, in the both‑good case, “switch at boundary” equals (or has the same distribution as) [c_v(K)≠c_v(L)]. This equivalence is automatic in the anchored case (all three edges at v have the star color), but is nontrivial in general. Next step: either (i) redefine the labels to match the actual boundary edge colors (last edge of block j at v and first edge of block j+1 at v) and re‑prove the pair‑sampling lemma for those labels, or (ii) prove a symmetry lemma for good cubes showing that the boundary edge color at v has the same marginal/pair distribution as the “first‑edge at v” color used in c_v. Until this is established, we keep the u_v refinement as a promising conjectural route only.\n\n- Balanced‑regime LP blueprint (actionable). Variables: star‑type frequencies at v; 4‑cycle types through v; marked‑Q3 pattern frequencies (good/bad tags, and for good the f1 start color at v); linearized pair variables for disjoint triples. Constraints: normalization; marginalization from marked‑Q3 classes to star and 4‑cycle types; 4‑cycle consistency across faces at v; Dvořák’s badness filters; color‑swap and coordinate symmetries; disjoint‑pair product‑approximation with explicit ±20/(n−12) slack. Objective: maximize b_v. Any universal optimum < 1/2 (for large n) gives b ≤ 1/2 − γ and a constant improvement over 3/8 in the balanced regime.\n\nOpen items\n- Prove the equivalence (or distributional equality) needed to justify the u_v‑based boundary saving in the both‑good case.\n- Discrete minimization of H(r,n) at r≈n/2 (optional; not currently needed by Proposition J).\n- Enumerate marked‑Q3 isomorphism classes and their good/bad status and f1 start color at the mark; compute the induced face‑type triples to feed the LP.\n","new_notes_append":"True","new_outputs_md":"Lemma K (Uniformity and independence of boundary direction pairs)\nStatement.

For any ordered disjoint pair (A,B) of 3‑sets, the number of permutations with (B_j,B_{j+1})=(A,B) equals 3!·3!·(n−6)!, independent of (A,B). Hence (K,L) is uniform among ordered disjoint pairs. The vertex v_{3j} depends only on v0 and the sets of directions in earlier blocks B_1,…,B_{j−1}, while (K,L) depends only on positions 3j−2,…,3j+3.
