  "progress_md": "Round 0006 \u2014 Firming up the both-good (u_v) refinement: boundary-label equivalence; global inequality; and actionable LP prep\n\nAudit of output.md (gaps and precisions)\n- What is solid: The anchored-driven refinement is now fully rigorous (Lemma I; Proposition J; Lemma K for boundary sampling; explicit finite-n constants Corollary E0.1, Corollary J1\u2032). This quantitatively converts degree imbalance into a linear gain.\n- Remaining gap flagged in verifier notes: The complementary both-good refinement via the c_v-labels (u_v) is not yet curated because we lacked a clean justification that, at a both-good boundary, the boundary switch indicator equals [c_v(K) \u2260 c_v(L)]. This equivalence is actually a consequence of the exact way Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s modification uses f at boundaries for good Q3\u2019s. Below I state a short lemma (Boundary-label equivalence) and then a global Proposition (both-good u_v gain) that can be added to output.md.\n\nNew lemma (to add): Boundary-label equivalence for good Q3\u2019s\n- Statement. Fix a boundary j and let v=v_{3j} be its shared vertex. Suppose both neighboring Q3\u2019s at boundary j are good. Let K,L be their (ordered) 3-sets of directions as in Lemma K. With c_v(\u00b7) as in Corollary D (the color at v of the first edge along f1 inside a good Q3), we have\n  1_{switch at boundary j} = 1[ c_v(K) \u2260 c_v(L) ].\n- Proof idea (clean, local). In the modified geodesic, the 3-step segment used inside a good Q3(v,w) is (v, f(v,w), f(w,v), w) with f=f1 (since for good cubes f2\u2261f1 by Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s definition). At boundary j, the last edge of the preceding block is (f(v, v_{3j\u22123}), v), and the first edge of the next block is (v, f(v, v_{3j+3})). Both are of the form (v, f(v, \u00b7)) and hence have colors c_v(K) and c_v(L), respectively. Therefore a boundary switch occurs if and only if these two colors differ, i.e., iff c_v(K)\u2260c_v(L).\n- Why useful here. This bridges the previously missing step and legitimizes translating the both-good boundary switch distribution into the disagreement distribution of the c_v-labels under disjoint sampling of K,L.\n\nProposition (both-good boundary refinement via u_v)\n- Setup. For each vertex v, let G_v be the set of good triples at v, c_v:G_v\u2192{R,B} the first-edge color at v under f1, p_v the c_v-red fraction, and u_v:=|2p_v\u22121|. For a boundary j with shared vertex v, let q_v be the conditional probability (given v_{3j}=v) that both neighboring Q3\u2019s are good.\n- Claim. With the boundary-label equivalence and Lemma C, we have\n  E[1_{both-good at boundary}\u00b71_{switch}] = a/2 \u2212 (1/2)\u00b7E_v[q_v\u00b7u_v^2] \u00b1 o(1).\n  Consequently,\n  E[switches] \u2264 (1/3 + b/12)\u00b7n \u2212 (1/6)\u00b7E_v[q_v\u00b7u_v^2]\u00b7n + o(n).\n- Proof. Condition on a fixed boundary j and v=v_{3j}. By Lemma K, (K,L) is uniform over ordered disjoint pairs and independent of v. Conditioning further on both-good at v restricts (K,L) to ordered disjoint pairs in G_v; by uniformity, (K,L) is uniform on that subset. By the boundary-label equivalence, the boundary switch occurs iff c_v(K)\u2260c_v(L). Lemma C (applied with T=G_v and labeling c_v) gives P[c_v(K)\u2260c_v(L)] = 1/2 \u2212 u_v^2/2 \u00b1 O(1/n). Thus, conditioning on v,\n  E[1_{both-good}\u00b71_{switch} | v] = q_v\u00b7(1/2 \u2212 u_v^2/2) \u00b1 O(1/n).\nAveraging v uniformly (Proposition G) yields the displayed equality. Summing over \u2248n/3 boundaries and adding the interior term (1 \u2212 p/2) per block gives the global inequality. \u220e\n- Corollary (explicit unconditional coefficient). Anchored \u21d2 good implies q_v \u2265 \u03c4_v^2 \u2212 O(1/n) (Lemma E0 plus Lemma E). Hence\n  E[switches] \u2264 (1/3 + b/12)\u00b7n \u2212 (1/6)\u00b7E_v[\u03c4_v^2\u00b7u_v^2]\u00b7n + o(n)\n  \u2264 (1/3 + b/12 \u2212 (1/96)\u00b7E_v[u_v^2] + o(1))\u00b7n,\nusing \u03c4_v \u2265 1/4 \u2212 O(1/n).\n- Why useful. This provides a second, rigorous, vertex-averaged saving that applies even when degree-variance T_v is tiny. It complements Proposition J and cleanly isolates the (still difficult) regime where both T_v and u_v are small.\n\nRelationship between the two refinements (anchored vs u_v)\n- They hold simultaneously and provide two independent lower bounds on the both-good boundary saving; at analysis time we may take their maximum. Formally we state them as separate propositions to avoid double counting, since anchored-pairs are a subset of both-good.\n- Sanity checks:\n  \u2022 Balanced degrees and symmetric c_v (u_v=0): u_v route gives no gain; anchored route also gives none as T_v=0.\n  \u2022 Degree-biased but c_v perfectly balanced (contrived): anchored route still yields a linear gain via T_v.\n  \u2022 Balanced degrees but c_v has variance (u_v^2>0): the u_v route yields a linear gain even when T_v\u22480.\n\nSmall auxiliary inequality (anchored triples imply a baseline u_v)\n- For any v with red degree r, anchored triples at v force c_v(K) to equal the star color on those K, hence\n  u_v \u2265 |C(r,3) \u2212 C(n\u2212r,3)| / (C(r,3) + C(n\u2212r,3)).\n  As n\u2192\u221e with x=r/n=1/2+t,\n  u_v \u2265 6|t| + O(t^3),\n  since (x^3 \u2212 (1\u2212x)^3)/(x^3 + (1\u2212x)^3) = (3/2)|2t| + O(t^3) divided by (1/4+3t^2). This lower bound is exact (finite-n) in the displayed ratio form using only \u201canchored \u21d2 good\u201d and \u03c4_v. It shows u_v cannot be uniformly tiny if degree-imbalance is macroscopic, and quantifies how T_v feeds into u_v.\n\nExamples (toy instances to test the u_v route)\n- Dictatorial-direction Q3 (bad): shows that c_v is undefined there; consistent with us only using c_v on good triples.\n- Mixed good classes with a marked vertex (balanced star): it is possible to arrange at a single v that p_v\u22601/2 (u_v>0) while r_v=n/2 by biasing the f1-start colors across non-anchored good classes; this illustrates that the u_v route can operate in T_v\u22480 regimes.\n\nNotes on constants and finite-n bookkeeping\n- The o(1) in the u_v proposition can be replaced by an explicit \u2264 (20/(n\u221212)) using Corollary E0.1 when translating disjoint-pair uniformity for G_v; this makes the finite-n coefficient fully explicit, matching the style of Corollary J1\u2032.\n- For clarity when curating: state explicitly that ordered/unordered distinctions do not affect disagreement ratios under uniformity; in the both-good conditioning, (K,L) is uniform over ordered disjoint pairs in G_v.\n\nLP blueprint (balanced regime) \u2014 concrete next actions\n- Enumerative input for the LP:\n  1) List marked-Q3 isomorphism classes (2-colorings of Q3 with one vertex marked), tag good/bad (by Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s definition), and for good classes record the f1-start color at the mark.\n  2) For each class \u03c0, tabulate the triple of face-types at the mark among {mono, two-adjacent, two-opposite, alternating}. This induces linear maps z_\u03c0 \u21a6 star- and 4-cycle-type marginals at v.\n- Constraints (recap): normalization; marginalization from z_\u03c0 to star and 4-cycle types; 4-cycle consistency across the three faces at v and across cubes sharing a face; Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s badness filters (Lemma 9 at v and at the antipode in the cube); color-swap and S_n symmetries; disjoint-pair product approximation with \u00b120/(n\u221212) slack.\n- Objective: maximize b_v under these constraints. Any universal optimum < 1/2 (for large n) yields b \u2264 1/2 \u2212 \u03b3 and thus beats 3/8 universally.\n\nObstacles and why they matter\n- The LP requires the marked-Q3 enumeration; without it we cannot compute the face-type linear maps nor enforce the badness filters precisely.\n- Combining the two savings (anchored and u_v) additively is not immediate due to overlap on anchored-good pairs; we therefore present them as separate bounds and take the stronger one when analyzing a given coloring.\n\nNext steps (auditable deliverables)\n1) Curate the Boundary-label equivalence lemma and the u_v Proposition (both-good refinement) into output.md, together with the finite-n explicit version using Corollary E0.1.\n2) Add the simple anchored-implies-u_v lower bound (ratio of binomials) as an auxiliary lemma; it clarifies how T_v forces u_v.\n3) Begin the marked-Q3 enumeration with a marked vertex: produce the class list and the (good/bad, f1-start, face-type) table. This concretely instantiates the LP for the balanced regime.\n\nWhy this advances the program\n- It closes the key gap in the both-good refinement, providing a second rigorous, vertex-averaged saving term. Together with the anchored route, we now have two robust mechanisms that yield linear-in-n improvements in large structural regimes. The LP plan targets the remaining near-balanced case where both T_v and u_v^2 are small, exactly the obstruction to a universal \u03b4>0 improvement over 3/8.\n"
