This quantitatively converts degree imbalance into a linear gain.\\n- Remaining gap flagged in verifier notes: The complementary both-good refinement via the c_v-labels (u_v) is not yet curated because we lacked a clean justification that, at a both-good boundary, the boundary switch indicator equals [c_v(K) ≠ c_v(L)]. This equivalence is actually a consequence of the exact way Dvořák’s modification uses f at boundaries for good Q3’s. Below I state a short lemma (Boundary-label equivalence) and then a global Proposition (both-good u_v gain) that can be added to output.md.\\n\\nNew lemma (to add): Boundary-label equivalence for good Q3’s\\n- Statement. Fix a boundary j and let v=v_{3j} be its shared vertex. Suppose both neighboring Q3’s at boundary j are good. Let K,L be their (ordered) 3-sets of directions as in Lemma K. With c_v(·) as in Corollary D (the color at v of the first edge along f1 inside a good Q3), we have\\n  1_{switch at boundary j} = 1[ c_v(K) ≠ c_v(L) ].\\n- Proof idea (clean, local). In the modified geodesic, the 3-step segment used inside a good Q3(v,w) is (v, f(v,w), f(w,v), w) with f=f1 (since for good cubes f2≡f1 by Dvořák’s definition). At boundary j, the last edge of the preceding block is (f(v, v_{3j−3}), v), and the first edge of the next block is (v, f(v, v_{3j+3})). Both are of the form (v, f(v, ·)) and hence have colors c_v(K) and c_v(L), respectively. Therefore a boundary switch occurs if and only if these two colors differ, i.e., iff c_v(K)≠c_v(L).\\n- Why useful here. This bridges the previously missing step and legitimizes translating the both-good boundary switch distribution into the disagreement distribution of the c_v-labels under disjoint sampling of K,L.\\n\\nProposition (both-good boundary refinement via u_v)\\n- Setup. For each vertex v, let G_v be the set of good triples at v, c_v:G_v→{R,B} the first-edge color at v under f1, p_v the c_v-red fraction, and u_v:=|2p_v−1|. For a boundary j with shared vertex v, let q_v be the conditional probability (given v_{3j}=v) that both neighboring Q3’s are good.\\n- Claim. With the boundary-label equivalence and Lemma C, we have\\n  E[1_{both-good at boundary}·1_{switch}] = a/2 − (1/2)·E_v[q_v·u_v^2] ± o(1).\\n  Consequently,\\n  E[switches] ≤ (1/3 + b/12)·n − (1/6)·E_v[q_v·u_v^2]·n + o(n).\\n- Proof. Condition on a fixed boundary j and v=v_{3j}. By Lemma K, (K,L) is uniform over ordered disjoint pairs and independent of v. Conditioning further on both-good at v restricts (K,L) to ordered disjoint pairs in G_v; by uniformity, (K,L) is uniform on that subset. By the boundary-label equivalence, the boundary switch occurs iff c_v(K)≠c_v(L). Lemma C (applied with T=G_v and labeling c_v) gives P[c_v(K)≠c_v(L)] = 1/2 − u_v^2/2 ± O(1/n). Thus, conditioning on v,\\n  E[1_{both-good}·1_{switch} | v] = q_v·(1/2 − u_v^2/2) ± O(1/n).\\nAveraging v uniformly (Proposition G) yields the displayed equality. Summing over ≈n/3 boundaries and adding the interior term (1 − p/2) per block gives the global inequality. ∎\\n- Corollary (explicit unconditional coefficient). Anchored ⇒ good implies q_v ≥ τ_v^2 − O(1/n) (Lemma E0 plus Lemma E). Hence\\n  E[switches] ≤ (1/3 + b/12)·n − (1/6)·E_v[τ_v^2·u_v^2]·n + o(n)\\n  ≤ (1/3 + b/12 − (1/96)·E_v[u_v^2] + o(1))·n,\\nusing τ_v ≥ 1/4 − O(1/n).\\n- Why useful. This provides a second, rigorous, vertex-averaged saving that applies even when degree-variance T_v is tiny. It complements Proposition J and cleanly isolates the (still difficult) regime where both T_v and u_v are small.\\n\\nRelationship between the two refinements (anchored vs u_v)\\n- They hold simultaneously and provide two independent lower bounds on the both-good boundary saving; at analysis time we may take their maximum. Formally we state them as separate propositions to avoid double counting, since anchored-pairs are a subset of both-good.\\n- Sanity checks:\\n  • Balanced degrees and symmetric c_v (u_v=0): u_v route gives no gain; anchored route also gives none as T_v=0.\\n  • Degree-biased but c_v perfectly balanced (contrived): anchored route still yields a linear gain via T_v.\\n  • Balanced degrees but c_v has variance (u_v^2>0): the u_v route yields a linear gain even when T_v≈0.\\n\\nSmall auxiliary inequality (anchored triples imply a baseline u_v)\\n- For any v with red degree r, anchored triples at v force c_v(K) to equal the star color on those K, hence\\n  u_v ≥ |C(r,3) − C(n−r,3)| / (C(r,3) + C(n−r,3)).\\n  As n→∞ with x=r/n=1/2+t,\\n  u_v ≥ 6|t| + O(t^3),\\n  since (x^3 − (1−x)^3)/(x^3 + (1−x)^3) = (3/2)|2t| + O(t^3) divided by (1/4+3t^2). This lower bound is exact (finite-n) in the displayed ratio form using only “anchored ⇒ good” and τ_v. It shows u_v cannot be uniformly tiny if degree-imbalance is macroscopic, and quantifies how T_v feeds into u_v.\\n\\nExamples (toy instances to test the u_v route)\\n- Dictatorial-direction Q3 (bad): shows that c_v is undefined there; consistent with us only using c_v on good triples.\\n- Mixed good classes with a marked vertex (balanced star): it is possible to arrange at a single v that p_v≠1/2 (u_v>0) while r_v=n/2 by biasing the f1-start colors across non-anchored good classes; this illustrates that the u_v route can operate in T_v≈0 regimes.\\n\\nNotes on constants and finite-n bookkeeping\\n- The o(1) in the u_v proposition can be replaced by an explicit ≤ (20/(n−12)) using Corollary E0.1 when translating disjoint-pair uniformity for G_v; this makes the finite-n coefficient fully explicit, matching the style of Corollary J1′.\\n- For clarity when curating: state explicitly that ordered/unordered distinctions do not affect disagreement ratios under uniformity; in the both-good conditioning, (K,L) is uniform over ordered disjoint pairs in G_v.\\n\\nLP blueprint (balanced regime) — concrete next actions\\n- Enumerative input for the LP:\\n  1) List marked-Q3 isomorphism classes (2-colorings of Q3 with one vertex marked), tag good/bad (by Dvořák’s definition), and for good classes record the f1-start color at the mark.\\n  2) For each class π, tabulate the triple of face-types at the mark among {mono, two-adjacent, two-opposite, alternating}. This induces linear maps z_π ↦ star- and 4-cycle-type marginals at v.\\n- Constraints (recap): normalization; marginalization from z_π to star and 4-cycle types; 4-cycle consistency across the three faces at v and across cubes sharing a face; Dvořák’s badness filters (Lemma 9 at v and at the antipode in the cube); color-swap and S_n symmetries; disjoint-pair product approximation with ±20/(n−12) slack.\\n- Objective: maximize b_v under these constraints. Any universal optimum < 1/2 (for large n) yields b ≤ 1/2 − γ and thus beats 3/8 universally.\\n\\nObstacles and why they matter\\n- The LP requires the marked-Q3 enumeration; without it we cannot compute the face-type linear maps nor enforce the badness filters precisely.\\n- Combining the two savings (anchored and u_v) additively is not immediate due to overlap on anchored-good pairs; we therefore present them as separate bounds and take the stronger one when analyzing a given coloring.\\n\\nNext steps (auditable deliverables)\\n1) Curate the Boundary-label equivalence lemma and the u_v Proposition (both-good refinement) into output.md, together with the finite-n explicit version using Corollary E0.1.\\n2) Add the simple anchored-implies-u_v lower bound (ratio of binomials) as an auxiliary lemma; it clarifies how T_v forces u_v.\\n3) Begin the marked-Q3 enumeration with a marked vertex: produce the class list and the (good/bad, f1-start, face-type) table. This concretely instantiates the LP for the balanced regime.\\n\\nWhy this advances the program\\n- It closes the key gap in the both-good refinement, providing a second rigorous, vertex-averaged saving term. Together with the anchored route, we now have two robust mechanisms that yield linear-in-n improvements in large structural regimes. The LP plan targets the remaining near-balanced case where both T_v and u_v^2 are small, exactly the obstruction to a universal δ>0 improvement over 3/8.\\n\"}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"auto","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"ProverOutput","schema_":{"properties":{"progress_md":{"description":"Append-only progress notes","title":"Progress Md","type":"string"}},"required":["progress_md"],"title":"ProverOutput","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":50975,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":14868,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":12480},"total_tokens":65843},"user":null,"store":true}
