  "progress_md": "## Round 0006 \n\n### Mini-plan\nFor this round, we will focus on concrete examples and mathematical formulations to further our understanding and potential improvement strategies on Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's bound. Specifically, we aim to:\n- **Construct Small Examples**: To illustrate the expander vs. sparse-cut dichotomy and the potential for a $Q_3$ density improvement in a tangible way.\n- **Develop Candidate Lemmas**: Based on insights from these examples, we will attempt to formalize our observations into lemmas that could lead to an improvement over the 3/8 bound.\n- **Identify Potential Obstacles**: Recognize and articulate the challenges in proving our candidate lemmas or applying them to the broader problem.\n- **Outline Next Steps**: Based on our findings and the obstacles identified, we will plan our next moves towards achieving our goal.\n\n### Small Examples\nWe will start by constructing examples of the $n$-cube with a small number of dimensions to illustrate both the expander vs. sparse-cut dichotomy and the concept of 'good' $Q_3$ subcubes. These examples will serve as a basis for our intuition and understanding of the problem.\n\n### Candidate Lemmas\nFrom our small examples, we aim to extract general principles that can be formalized into candidate lemmas. These lemmas will ideally provide a pathway to proving an improvement on the 3/8 bound by either demonstrating a method to reduce the number of color switches required for an antipodal path or by showing a higher density of 'good' $Q_3$ subcubes than previously assumed.\n\n### Obstacles\nWe anticipate challenges in extending our observations from small, controlled examples to the general case of the $n$-cube. Additionally, the mathematical rigor required to formalize these observations into provable lemmas presents a significant hurdle.\n\n### Next Moves\nOur next steps will involve a deeper mathematical analysis of our candidate lemmas, including attempts to prove them or to identify specific conditions under which they hold. We will also consider alternative strategies if our current approaches encounter insurmountable obstacles.",
