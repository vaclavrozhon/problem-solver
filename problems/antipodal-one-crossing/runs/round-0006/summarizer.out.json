  "summary_md": "Round 0006 closes the key gap in the both-good (u_v) refinement by proving a boundary-label equivalence (Lemma L) and the required conditioning uniformity (Proposition G3), then using Corollary D/C to derive Proposition K: E[1_{both-good}\u00b71_{switch}] = a/2 \u2212 (1/2)\u00b7E_v[q_v\u00b7u_v^2] \u00b1 O(1/n). Summing over boundaries gives the global bound E[switches] \u2264 (1/3 + b/12)n \u2212 (1/6)\u00b7E_v[q_v\u00b7u_v^2]\u00b7n + o(n). Using anchored triples (q_v \u2265 \u03c4_v^2 \u2212 O(1/n)) yields the unconditional corollary E[switches] \u2264 (1/3 + b/12 \u2212 (1/96)\u00b7E_v[u_v^2] + o(1))\u00b7n. Finite-n slack can be made explicit (\u226420/(n\u221212)). These results complement the anchored (T_v) saving and isolate the remaining \u201cbalanced\u201d regime where both T_v and u_v^2 are small; the next attack is an LP over marked-Q3 classes.
