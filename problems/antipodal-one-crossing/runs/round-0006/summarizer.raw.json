Summing over boundaries gives the global bound E[switches] ≤ (1/3 + b/12)n − (1/6)·E_v[q_v·u_v^2]·n + o(n). Using anchored triples (q_v ≥ τ_v^2 − O(1/n)) yields the unconditional corollary E[switches] ≤ (1/3 + b/12 − (1/96)·E_v[u_v^2] + o(1))·n. Finite-n slack can be made explicit (≤20/(n−12)). These results complement the anchored (T_v) saving and isolate the remaining “balanced” regime where both T_v and u_v^2 are small; the next attack is an LP over marked-Q3 classes.
