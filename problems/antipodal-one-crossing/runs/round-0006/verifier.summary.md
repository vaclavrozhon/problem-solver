High-level: Both reports converged on the missing boundary–label equivalence for the both-good refinement, and on a rigorous u_v-based global inequality. This is the right gap to close. With one adjustment to the definition of c_v (align it with the path actually chosen by Dvořák inside each good Q3), the boundary equivalence becomes immediate and the remainder of the argument (uniformity of conditioning, pair-sampling, and global averaging) is sound and compatible with the existing sampling lemmas in output.md. The resulting Proposition K (u_v-based both-good refinement) is ready to curate, together with a corollary giving an explicit 1/96 coefficient when only τ_v ≥ 1/4 is used.
