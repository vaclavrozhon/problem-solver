• - The dichotomy between expander and sparse-cut cases lacks a rigorous mathematical formulation and proof.
• - The hypothesis that 'good' $Q_3$ subcubes can exceed a density of 1/2 is intriguing but unsupported by concrete evidence or a mathematical model.
• - Candidate lemmas and potential obstacles are identified, but the approach remains speculative without deeper analysis or empirical validation.
• - Next steps should include formalizing ideas into precise mathematical statements, proving these statements or providing counterexamples, and developing systematic testing methods.
