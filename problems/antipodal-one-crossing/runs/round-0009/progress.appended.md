## Round 0009 

### Mini-plan
For this round, we will refine our approach based on previous insights and feedback. Our focus will remain on exploring the expander vs. sparse-cut dichotomy and the potential for a $Q_3$ density improvement. We aim to:
- **Construct More Detailed Examples**: Deepen our understanding with more complex examples that highlight the nuances of our strategies.
- **Refine Candidate Lemmas**: Based on these examples, sharpen the formulation of our candidate lemmas to more directly target the improvement of the 3/8 bound.
- **Identify and Address Obstacles**: Clearly articulate potential challenges and strategize on how to overcome them.
- **Outline Next Steps**: Based on our refined understanding, plan further actions to progress towards our goal.

### Small Examples
Building on our previous work, we will construct examples that not only illustrate the basic principles but also expose the complexities and subtleties of the expander vs. sparse-cut dichotomy and the $Q_3$ density argument. These examples will serve as a testbed for our hypotheses and help us refine our understanding of the problem.

### Candidate Lemmas
With a deeper understanding gained from our examples, we will attempt to refine our candidate lemmas. These lemmas will be more closely aligned with the specific improvements we seek over the 3/8 bound, with a focus on actionable insights that can be applied to the broader problem.

### Obstacles
We anticipate challenges in generalizing our findings from specific examples to the $n$-cube at large. Additionally, the mathematical complexity of formalizing and proving our refined candidate lemmas may present significant hurdles.

### Next Moves
Our next steps will involve a more detailed mathematical analysis and potential empirical testing of our refined candidate lemmas. We will also consider alternative approaches if we encounter insurmountable obstacles, keeping our ultimate goal in focus.
