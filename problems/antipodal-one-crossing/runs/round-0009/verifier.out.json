  "feedback_md": "The prover's approach to improving Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's 3/8 bound on color changes in the $n$-cube is ambitious and explores several promising avenues. However, the documentation lacks rigorous mathematical proofs and relies heavily on conjectures and unverified claims. The division into cases based on block bias and the exploration of $Q_3$ density are interesting, but without concrete proof or empirical evidence, these ideas remain speculative. The reliance on 'good' $Q_3$ subcubes exceeding a density of 1/2 is particularly critical and needs a solid mathematical foundation to be credible. The prover's iterative approach, focusing on small examples and attempting to generalize, is a sound strategy but has yet to yield definitive results. The documentation would benefit significantly from a more rigorous mathematical treatment, including formal definitions, lemmas, and proofs, to move beyond conjecture. Additionally, the exploration of potential obstacles and the formulation of next steps suggest a thoughtful process but lack specificity in how these challenges will be addressed. Overall, the prover's work is in the early stages, and substantial effort is required to increase the rigor and credibility of the proposed improvements to Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's bound.",
