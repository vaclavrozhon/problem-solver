• The prover's exploration of improving Dvořák's bound lacks rigorous mathematical proofs and relies on speculative claims.
• The dichotomy between expander and sparse-cut cases, and the potential for $Q_3$ density improvement, are interesting but unproven.
• The documentation would benefit from formal definitions, lemmas, and proofs to substantiate the claims.
• The iterative approach and focus on small examples are promising but have yet to yield concrete results.
• Next steps are outlined but lack specificity in addressing identified challenges.
