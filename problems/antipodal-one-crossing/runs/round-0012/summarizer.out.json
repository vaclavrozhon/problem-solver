  "summary_md": "In Round 0012, the prover focused on refining candidate lemmas and constructing detailed examples to improve Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's 3/8 bound on color changes in the n-cube. The mini-plan included creating intricate examples to illustrate the expander vs. sparse-cut dichotomy, refining candidate lemmas, identifying obstacles, and outlining next steps. Key lemmas proposed include the Conductance Lemma, which suggests a color's conductance can be determined by its distribution in blocks, and the Density Lemma, which posits that a significant fraction of 'good' Q3 subcubes exists. However, challenges remain in generalizing local properties and formalizing the lemmas rigorously. The round concluded with a need for empirical testing and further analysis of the lemmas.",
