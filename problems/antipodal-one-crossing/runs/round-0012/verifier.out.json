  "feedback_md": "The prover's latest round demonstrates a focused effort to refine candidate lemmas and construct detailed examples aimed at improving Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's 3/8 bound on color changes in the n-cube. However, there are several gaps and potential issues that need addressing. Firstly, the proposed 'Conductance Lemma' lacks a rigorous justification for the claim that a color occupying a certain fraction of blocks guarantees a specific conductance in the entire cube. This relationship may not hold universally, particularly in cases where color distribution is uneven. A counterexample could involve a coloring where the majority color is concentrated in a few blocks, leading to misleading conclusions about overall conductance. Secondly, the 'Density Lemma' similarly requires a stronger foundation; the assumption that a significant fraction of 'good' Q3 subcubes can exist needs empirical or theoretical backing. Without this, the claim remains speculative. The prover should focus on establishing clear proofs or counterexamples for these lemmas and consider the implications of their findings on the broader problem. Additionally, while the mini-plan outlines a structured approach, it would benefit from more specific methodologies for testing the proposed lemmas and examples. Overall, the progress is promising but requires more rigorous validation.",
