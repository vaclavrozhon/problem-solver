• The prover is refining candidate lemmas and constructing detailed examples.
• The 'Conductance Lemma' needs rigorous justification; the relationship may not hold universally.
• The 'Density Lemma' requires empirical or theoretical backing to support its claims.
• Counterexamples should be explored to validate or invalidate the proposed lemmas.
• The mini-plan is structured but could benefit from specific methodologies for testing.
• Overall progress is promising but needs more rigorous validation.
