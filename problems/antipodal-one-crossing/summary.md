Round summary: The round critically reviewed brainstormed approaches and fixed two key errors in task.tex: (1) the block-to-expansion sublemma is false as stated (explicit parity-coloring counterexample shows β_J = 1/2 for every block yet the monochromatic subgraph is disconnected), and (2) the Chernoff-style Case A bound is incorrect (expected off-color edges in a mildly biased block are ≈(1/2−ε)|J|, not O(ε|J|)). It was observed that raising p (fraction of good Q3’s) alone does not help because Dvořák’s formula depends on b (good–bad neighbor probability); to beat 3/8 one must force b ≤ 1/2−γ. A refined vertex-wise spectral MAX-CUT on KG(n,3) gives b_v ≤ 1/2 + 3/(2(n−3)), so vertex-only constraints cannot produce an absolute γ. Proposed concrete next moves: (A) enumerate Q3 colorings up to isomorphism and record the f1 "preferred color" at a marked vertex, (B) set up an LP/SDP over local 1/2/3-edge statistics with 4-cycle consistency and Dvořák badness filters to test whether local constraints force b ≤ 1/2−γ, and (C) formulate a corrected block-expansion lemma that includes endpoint-balance.

## round-0002 — model summary — 2025-08-27T19:00:30.042978Z
Round 0002 audited output.md and Dvořák (EJC 2020) and introduced a quantitative anchored–anchored analysis that converts local degree-variance into a linear gain in the both-good (a-term) contribution. The round defines H(r,n) (exact anchored–anchored probability at a vertex with red-degree r), computes the conditional disagreement probability for anchored pairs and shows
P[σ1≠σ2 | A] = 1/2 − (9/2)·t^2 + O(1/n + t^4) with t = r/n − 1/2. Averaging gives an explicit a-term reduction Δ_a ≥ (9/64)·E_v[(r_v/n − 1/2)^2] + O(1/n), so any nontrivial mean-square degree imbalance yields a linear improvement in expected switches. For the remaining balanced-degree regime the round proposes an LP skeleton (star types, 4-cycle classes, Q3 pattern frequencies; marginals, 4-cycle consistency, badness filters) to upper-bound b and either produce γ>0 or expose extremal local statistics. Next concrete tasks are proving H is minimized at r≈n/2, formalizing the anchored–anchored inequality in output.md, and enumerating Q3 classes to build/solve the LP.

## round-0003 — model summary — 2025-08-27T19:50:11.953816Z
Round 0003 produced an anchored–anchored refinement that is fully quantified and integrated into Dvořák’s boundary term. We derived exact vertex-wise counts for ordered anchored–anchored Q3 pairs and showed asymptotically H(r,n) = (x^3+(1−x)^3)^2+O(1/n), minimized at x=1/2, giving an unconditional a ≥ 1/16 − O(1/n). Conditioning on both anchored at v yields the expansion P[disagree | anchored] = 1/2 − 18·(x−1/2)^2 + O((x−1/2)^4 + 1/n). Correcting the interior-block baseline to 1−p/2 and averaging uniformly over boundary vertices yields the refined global bound E[switches] ≤ (1/3 + b/12)·n − (Δ_total/3)·n + o(n) with Δ_total ≥ 18·E_v[T_v·τ_v^2] − o(1). Consequently any mean-square degree imbalance E_v[T_v] ≥ ε yields a linear saving ≳(3ε/8)·n, isolating the near-balanced-degree case as the remaining hard regime. Key next steps are to include the explicit “anchored ⇒ good” lemma, give a discrete minimization proof for H(r,n), and run the LP attack on the balanced case.

## round-0004 — model summary — 2025-08-27T20:01:44.487862Z
Round 0004 (prover-02) produced two checkable, global ingredients that close the anchored-driven improvement gap. Lemma I gives an exact, uniform inequality for the anchored–anchored disagreement: if x=r/n and t=x−1/2 then P[disagree | anchored] = 2 x^3(1−x)^3/(x^3+(1−x)^3)^2 and 1/2 − P[disagree | anchored] ≥ 2 t^2 for all x∈[0,1]. Proposition J' integrates this with the membership-under-disjointness and uniform-boundary lemmas to get the global bound E[switches] ≤ (1/3 + b/12)·n − (2/3)·E_v[τ_v^2·T_v]·n + o(n). Using τ_v ≥ 1/4 yields the corollary E[switches] ≤ (1/3 + b/12 − (1/24)·E_v[T_v] + o(1))·n, so any nontrivial mean-square degree imbalance gives a linear-in-n improvement over the Dvořák baseline. The round also sketches the next focused program for the balanced-degree regime (enumerate Q3 classes with a marked vertex and build an LP/SDP to bound b). Citations: prover-02.out.json; output.md.

## round-0005 — model summary — 2025-08-27T20:14:17.199006Z
Round 0005 produced complementary, checkable refinements and a concrete LP blueprint. Prover-01 introduced Proposition G2 (boundary 3-set pair uniformity independent of the shared vertex), Proposition K (both-good boundary refinement via u_v giving a saving ≥ (1/6)·E_v[τ_v^2·u_v^2]·n and hence ≥ (1/96)·E_v[u_v^2]·n), and an exact closed form for the anchored drop 1/2−R(x)=2T(9+24T+16T^2)/(1+24T+144T^2) with small‑T amplifications. Prover-02 supplied the same uniformity lemma, explicit finite‑n constants for Lemma E0 (|S_K|=(9n^2−45n+60)/6 ⇒ error ≤10/(n−12)), and a finite‑n coefficient c(n)=(2/3)·τ_min^2→1/24 that sharpens Proposition J. Both provers laid out the LP/enumeration plan to attack the remaining near‑balanced regime. Verifier verdict: partial success. Citations: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json.

## round-0006 — model summary — 2025-08-27T20:24:08.694301Z
Round 0006 closes the key gap in the both-good (u_v) refinement by proving a boundary-label equivalence (Lemma L) and the required conditioning uniformity (Proposition G3), then using Corollary D/C to derive Proposition K: E[1_{both-good}·1_{switch}] = a/2 − (1/2)·E_v[q_v·u_v^2] ± O(1/n). Summing over boundaries gives the global bound E[switches] ≤ (1/3 + b/12)n − (1/6)·E_v[q_v·u_v^2]·n + o(n). Using anchored triples (q_v ≥ τ_v^2 − O(1/n)) yields the unconditional corollary E[switches] ≤ (1/3 + b/12 − (1/96)·E_v[u_v^2] + o(1))·n. Finite-n slack can be made explicit (≤20/(n−12)). These results complement the anchored (T_v) saving and isolate the remaining “balanced” regime where both T_v and u_v^2 are small; the next attack is an LP over marked-Q3 classes.
