This yields a path-wise certification criterion for the natural algorithm (run IRV on the sample; use its elimination path and measured slacks to certify robustness).\n- Start with K=3 to validate the mechanism concretely, then state the general K claim and identify the exact class of linear forms and its cardinality to derive uniform concentration bounds.\n\n# Definitions and notation\n- Let P be the true distribution over the K! rankings; S be the empirical distribution on m sampled ballots (with replacement).\n- For a subset A \u2286 [K], define score_x(P; A) := probability that, under P, the top-ranked candidate among A on a random ballot is x. This is linear in P with coefficients in {0,1}.\n- For a fixed elimination order \u03c3 = (e_1, e_2, \u2026, e_{K-1}, w) (where e_r is eliminated at round r and w is the last remaining), define A_r := [K] \\ {e_1,\u2026,e_{r-1}}.\n- For each round r and y \u2208 A_r \\ {e_r}, define the linear functional (inequality margin):\n  d_{r,y}(P) := score_y(P; A_r) \u2212 score_{e_r}(P; A_r).\n- The elimination order \u03c3 is feasible under P iff d_{r,y}(P) \u2265 0 for all r and all such y, with ties handled by the fixed rule consistent with \u03c3.\n\n# Proposition (K = 3: sample-to-true \u03b5-winner certificate)\nClaim: Suppose K=3 and the IRV winner on the sample S is c with elimination order (e, other, c). If, in S, both inequalities hold with slack \u2265 2\u03b5:\n- First-choice elimination: score_e(S; {a,b,c}) \u2264 min(score_a(S; {a,b,c}), score_b(S; {a,b,c})) \u2212 2\u03b5.\n- Final pairwise: m_{c,other}(S) := Pr_S[c \u227b other] \u2212 Pr_S[other \u227b c] \u2265 2\u03b5.\nIf additionally the empirical deviations for these statistics satisfy |score_x(S; [3]) \u2212 score_x(P; [3])| \u2264 \u03b5 and |m_{c,other}(S) \u2212 m_{c,other}(P)| \u2264 \u03b5, then c is an \u03b5-winner for P.\n\nWhy useful here: Gives a concrete m via Hoeffding to ensure with high probability that the sample winner is an \u03b5-winner for K=3.\n\nSketch proof: Under the deviation bounds, in P we have score_e \u2264 min(score_a, score_b) \u2212 \u03b5 and m_{c,other} \u2265 \u03b5. Consider adding \u03b5 mass of ballots all ranking c \u227b other \u227b e. In the mixed profile P' = (1\u2212\u03b5)P + \u03b5Q, the elimination gap against e for at least one of {a,b} increases by \u03b5, others are unchanged but remain \u2265 (1\u2212\u03b5)\u03b5 > 0; the pairwise margin becomes m'_{c,other} = (1\u2212\u03b5)m_{c,other}(P) + \u03b5 \u2265 (1\u2212\u03b5)\u03b5 + \u03b5 > 0. Thus the elimination order and final majority persist, and c wins in P'. Therefore c is an \u03b5-winner.\n\nConcentration: There are O(1) statistics here. Hoeffding yields m \u2265 C (log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2 suffices.\n\n# General K: path-wise certificate and concentration\nClaim (Certificate): Let \u03c3 be the elimination order produced by running IRV on S, with winner w. For every round r and every y \u2208 A_r \\ {e_r}, suppose the margins in S satisfy d_{r,y}(S) \u2265 2\u03b5. If for all these linear forms |d_{r,y}(S) \u2212 d_{r,y}(P)| \u2264 \u03b5, then w is an \u03b5-winner for P.\n\nWhy useful here: Reduces the success of the natural algorithm to uniform concentration of a finite family of linear forms; yields a clean sample complexity bound once we bound the family\u2019s size.\n\nProof sketch: Under the deviation bounds, d_{r,y}(P) \u2265 \u03b5 for all needed (r,y). Let Q place all \u03b5 mass on the single ranking that orders candidates according to \u03c3 (w at top, then e_{K-1}, \u2026, with e_1 last). In P' = (1\u2212\u03b5)P + \u03b5Q, each inequality evolves as\n- d_{r,y}(P') = (1\u2212\u03b5)d_{r,y}(P) + \u03b5 d_{r,y}(Q), where d_{r,y}(Q) \u2208 {0,1} since e_r is never top among A_r under Q and exactly one y_r (the highest in A_r per \u03c3) has d_{r,y_r}(Q) = 1, all other y have 0. Hence all inequalities remain \u2265 (1\u2212\u03b5)\u03b5 \u2265 0, and for y_r they receive an extra +\u03b5. Therefore all constraints hold in P', making \u03c3 a valid elimination path and w the winner. So w is an \u03b5-winner.\n\nUniform concentration: Each d_{r,y} is the difference of two indicators of the form \u201ctop among A equals x,\u201d so its range is in [\u22121,1]. The family of such differences, over all subsets A and ordered pairs (y, x) \u2208 A\u00d7A with y \u2260 x, has cardinality\nU = \u03a3_{s=2}^K binom(K,s) s(s\u22121) = K(K\u22121) 2^{K\u22122} (identity via moments of (1+x)^K).\nThus by a union bound plus Hoeffding, with m \u2265 C (log U + log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2 = C' (K + log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2, we have |d_{r,y}(S) \u2212 d_{r,y}(P)| \u2264 \u03b5 simultaneously for all such forms with probability \u2265 1\u2212\u03b4. Consequently, on this event, whenever the sample path \u03c3 has margins \u2265 2\u03b5, the sample winner is an \u03b5-winner.\n\nRemark on adaptivity: The above uniform bound controls all d_{r,y} for all A, removing dependence on the random, sample-determined A_r.\n\n# Lower bounds (initial)\n- Even for K=3, any algorithm (hence the natural one) needs m = \u03a9((log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2) to ensure that, with probability \u2265 1\u2212\u03b4, the output is an \u03b5-winner. This follows by a two-point method on instances differing by pairwise margin 2\u03b5 while keeping the first-round elimination unchanged; distinguishing these requires \u03a9(1/\u03b5^2) samples by Hoeffding/Le Cam.\n- K dependence: At least \u03a9((log K)/\u03b5^2) samples are necessary for the natural algorithm by hiding the critical constraint among \u0398(K) (or \u0398(K^2)) possible comparisons and applying a union bound adversarially. A formal construction will be provided; intuitively, with m too small, some constraint along the sample\u2019s elimination path will have empirical slack inflated by \u2248\u03b5, producing a non-\u03b5-winner with constant probability.\n\n# Examples / sanity checks\n- K=3 toy profile: First-choice shares: e: 0.29, other: 0.35, c: 0.36; pairwise m_{c,other}(P) = 0.02 = \u03b5. With \u03b5-additions all ranking c \u227b other \u227b e, c wins; our condition captures this.\n- K=4: If S has all d_{r,y}(S) \u2265 2\u03b5 and m large enough for uniform \u03b5 accuracy, then setting Q to \u03c3-order ballots suffices to preserve all inequalities in P'. Try to break: pick a round r and a y \u2260 y_r; d_{r,y}(Q)=0, so P must carry the inequality unaided; but we ensured d_{r,y}(P) \u2265 \u03b5, which scales to (1\u2212\u03b5)\u03b5 > 0, so not broken.\n\n# Obstacles / gaps\n- Tightness of the K factor in the upper bound: we used log U = \u0398(K) to get m = O((K + log 1/\u03b4)/\u03b5^2), but we did not supply a matching \u03a9(K/\u03b5^2) lower bound. Constructing such a lower bound for the natural algorithm remains open here.\n- The certificate requires that the sample margins along its own path are \u2265 2\u03b5. The natural algorithm might sometimes produce small margins; then the guarantee is vacuous though the algorithm could still succeed. Deriving a bound that does not condition on empirical slack could be possible via stability parameters of P, but is not yet developed here.\n\n# Next steps\n- Formalize and write a complete proof for the general K certificate (with explicit algebra for d_{r,y}(P') and the choice of Q), and the concentration bound using U = K(K\u22121)2^{K\u22122}.\n- Prove a K=3 lower bound instance rigorously via Le Cam\u2019s method to pin down the constant in \u03a9((log 1/\u03b4)/\u03b5^2).\n- Attempt a general lower bound \u03a9((log K + log 1/\u03b4)/\u03b5^2) for the natural algorithm by constructing a hard family in which exactly one round\u2019s critical inequality is within \u03b5 and is uniformly hidden among \u0398(K) options.\n- Explore whether the log U argument can be sharpened (e.g., via symmetrization or chaining) to replace K by log K in the upper bound, or prove that \u0398(K) is necessary.\n\n# Gaps relative to \u201cCurrent Output\u201d\n- No output.md exists yet; the above provides concrete, testable propositions for K=3 and a general certificate, plus a clean sample complexity upper bound m = O((K + log 1/\u03b4)/\u03b5^2) under an empirical slack condition.\n"
