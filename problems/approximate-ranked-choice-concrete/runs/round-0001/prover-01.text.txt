# Ideas and notation
- Candidates C with |C|=K. A ballot is a total order on C.
- For any nonempty S⊆C and a∈S, let p_a(S)=Pr[top_S(ballot)=a], where top_S assigns the highest-ranked among S.
- The IRV elimination step on a profile uses counts N·p_a(S) (we work in fractional units, so counts=probabilities). Tie-breaking is a fixed known rule, but our sufficient conditions will avoid relying on ties.
- ε-winner: there exist ≤ε extra mass of ballots (as a fraction of the original electorate), whose rankings we can choose, so that candidate c wins the IRV process on the augmented profile.

# A sufficient certificate for ε-winner
Lemma 1 (per-round safety vs a chosen chain). Fix c. Suppose there exists an elimination order of the other K−1 candidates, yielding sets S_K=C, S_{K-1}, …, S_2 with c∈S_t and S_{t+1}=S_t\{b_t} for some b_t∈S_t\{c}, such that for every t we have
p_c(S_t) ≥ p_{b_t}(S_t) − ε,
and, whenever equality holds, tie-breaking at S_t would not eliminate c when the tied candidates are {c}∪A for some A⊆S_t\{c} that all attain the minimum. Then c is an ε-winner.

Proof. Add ε mass of ballots ranking c first. For any S containing c, p′_c(S)=p_c(S)+ε and p′_a(S)=p_a(S) for a≠c. For each t, p′_c(S_t) ≥ p_{b_t}(S_t) = p′_{b_t}(S_t) ≥ min_{a∈S_t\{c}} p′_a(S_t). Thus c is not strictly below the minimum among others at S_t; by the stated tie condition, c is not eliminated. Eliminating any minimizer b_t at each step is valid (others’ counts are unchanged), leading to c’s victory. ∎

Why useful: It reduces showing “c is an ε-winner” to checking finitely many inequalities (one per round along some chain). In particular, it suffices to verify these inequalities versus the specific b_t’s designated for elimination.

# Using the sample’s elimination chain as a witness
Given a sample of m ballots, run IRV to get a winner ĉ and an elimination sequence b̂_1,…,b̂_{K-1} with sets Ŝ_t. Define empirical shares p̂_a(Ŝ_t).
Observation: For each t with ĉ∈Ŝ_t, we have p̂_{ĉ}(Ŝ_t) ≥ p̂_{b̂_t}(Ŝ_t) by construction (ties resolved by the rule). If we can ensure (uniformly over these rounds) that |p̂_{ĉ}(Ŝ_t)−p_{ĉ}(Ŝ_t)| and |p̂_{b̂_t}(Ŝ_t)−p_{b̂_t}(Ŝ_t)| are ≤α, then p_{b̂_t}(Ŝ_t)−p_{ĉ}(Ŝ_t) ≤ 2α. Hence, with ε=2α and benign tie-breaking, Lemma 1 certifies ĉ as an ε-winner.

The adaptive dependence of Ŝ_t on the sample is the main obstacle. Two ways forward:
- Small K (e.g., K=3): We can uniformize over all relevant S.
- Split-sample: Use one subsample to fix the witness chain, a fresh subsample to estimate the needed quantities.

# Special case K=3: direct bound for the natural algorithm
Proposition 2 (K=3). Let K=3 and run IRV on m i.i.d. ballots to produce winner ĉ and chain (Ŝ_3,Ŝ_2). If m ≥ (8/ε^2)·ln(18/δ), then with probability ≥1−δ, ĉ is an ε-winner.

Proof. For K=3, the only sets S of interest are size 3 (C itself) and the three 2-candidate subsets. There are exactly 9 numbers p_a(S) to control (3 for S=C, and 2 for each 2-set). By Hoeffding and a union bound, with probability ≥1−δ we have |p̂_a(S)−p_a(S)| ≤ α for all these pairs, where α=√((1/(2m)) ln(18/δ)). On this event, along the (random) sample chain, for each round t with candidate b̂_t eliminated while ĉ survives, we have p_{b̂_t}(Ŝ_t)−p_{ĉ}(Ŝ_t) ≤ (p̂_{b̂_t}−p̂_{ĉ})+2α ≤ 2α. Taking ε=2α and invoking Lemma 1 (strictness holds unless ties align adversarially; if needed, replace ≤ by < via an arbitrarily small slack absorbed into ε), ĉ is an ε-winner. Solving 2α≤ε yields the stated m. ∎

# A general upper bound via a split-sample certificate
Algorithm (two-phase witness-and-verify):
1) Draw m_1 ballots, run IRV, get ĉ and witness chain b̂_1,…,b̂_{K-1} with sets Ŝ_t.
2) Draw m_2 fresh ballots. For each t, estimate p̃_{ĉ}(Ŝ_t), p̃_{b̂_t}(Ŝ_t). If for all t, p̃_{ĉ}(Ŝ_t) ≥ p̃_{b̂_t}(Ŝ_t) − ε/2 (and ties not adverse), output ĉ.

Proposition 3. If m_2 ≥ (2/ε^2)·ln(4(K−1)/δ), then with probability ≥1−δ (over phase 2), the output ĉ is an ε-winner.

Proof. Condition on phase-1 outcome (Ŝ_t,b̂_t). The 2(K−1) functions g_t^a(ballot)=1[top_{Ŝ_t}(ballot)=a] are now fixed. Hoeffding gives simultaneous |p̃−p|≤ε/4 with probability ≥1−δ for all these functions if m_2≥(2/ε^2)ln(4(K−1)/δ). Then for each t, p_{b̂_t}(Ŝ_t)−p_{ĉ}(Ŝ_t) ≤ (p̃_{b̂_t}−p̃_{ĉ})+ε/2 ≤ ε/2, and Lemma 1 applies with margin ε. ∎

Consequences: This yields an O((K/ε^2)·log(K/δ)) upper bound without exponential dependence on 2^K. It also suggests that the “natural” one-phase algorithm should enjoy the same order bound; handling its adaptivity is a next step.

# Lower bounds
- Baseline (K=2). Any algorithm that outputs an ε-winner must distinguish Bernoulli means μ and μ±ε/2. By Le Cam, for error ≤δ one needs m=Ω((1/ε^2)·log(1/δ)). This matches Proposition 2 up to constants.
- Fano-type (any K). Construct K distributions over ballots, each making a distinct candidate the unique ε/4-winner, with pairwise KL=Θ(ε^2). Then m=Ω((log K)/ε^2) is needed to identify an ε-winner with high probability. Sketch: concentrate nearly all mass on two-round structures ensuring uniqueness of the ε/4-winner and keep pairwise perturbations of order ε. We will formalize the construction and the IRV-specific uniqueness check.

We conjecture a sharper direct-sum lower bound Ω((K−1)/ε^2) for the natural algorithm by embedding K−1 near-independently ambiguous rounds, but this requires care because later-round tallies depend on earlier eliminations.

# Example (K=3) illustrating Lemma 1
Let C={a,b,c} with c our target. Suppose true shares: p_a(C)=0.38, p_b(C)=0.33, p_c(C)=0.29. After eliminating c (hypothetical), we don’t care. Consider the chain eliminating b first: S_3=C, b_1=b. Check p_c(C)−p_b(C)=−0.04. For S_2={a,c}, assume p_c({a,c})=0.49 and p_a({a,c})=0.51 so the deficit is −0.02 versus b_2=a. Then with ε=0.04, Lemma 1 applies: add 0.04 mass of c-first ballots; at S_3, c reaches 0.33 to match b and exceed (or tie-break benignly); at S_2, c reaches 0.53>0.51. Hence c is an ε-winner.

# Obstacles and checks
- Adaptivity: The natural algorithm’s chain depends on the sample; avoiding 2^K union bounds without a split-sample or stability argument remains open.
- Ties: Our statements either assume strict margins or that tie-breaking does not eliminate c when tied after adding ε. We can bake an arbitrarily small extra slack into ε to handle worst-case ties; careful accounting shows this can be done without exceeding ε if only finitely many ties occur.
- Exponential S: Lemma 1 only needs the K−1 sets along a single chain, not all 2^K; this is why the split-sample approach scales with K.

# Next steps
- Prove a one-phase uniform-deviation bound for the natural algorithm’s adaptively chosen sets via a stability/compression argument, to match the O((K/ε^2)·log(K/δ)) rate without sample splitting.
- Formalize the Ω((log K)/ε^2) Fano lower bound with explicit IRV-compatible distributions; explore whether Ω(K/ε^2) holds.
- Extend Proposition 2 to K=4 by identifying a small family of S sufficient to certify the chain (likely polynomial in K but smaller than 2^K via structural IRV identities).
- Tighten constants and explicitly handle adversarial tie-breaking by reserving a vanishing fraction of the ε budget to break ties across rounds.
