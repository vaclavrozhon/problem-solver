  "progress_md": "# Ideas\n\n- Notation. For a remaining set of candidates S and distribution P over full rankings: f_i(S) := P[ballot\u2019s top among S is i]. In each IRV round on P, eliminate r(S) = argmin_i f_i(S) (ties via fixed rule). Let the sequence of remaining sets along the true IRV path be S_1 \u228b S_2 \u228b \u2026 \u228b S_K, with |S_t| = K-t+1. Define per-round gap \u0394(S) := (second-smallest_i f_i(S)) \u2212 (smallest_i f_i(S)). Let \u0393 := min_t \u0394(S_t).\n- Empirical estimates. From m i.i.d. ballots, let \\hat f_i(S) be the empirical frequency that i is top among S.\n- Goal. Analyze the natural algorithm \u201crun IRV on the sample; output its winner \u0109\u201d. Provide upper bounds on m for \u0109 to be an \u03b5-winner w.h.p., and a matching (up to factors) lower-bound blueprint.\n\n# Lemmas / Claims\n\n- Lemma 1 (Stability under margins). If for all rounds t and all i \u2208 S_t, |\\hat f_i(S_t) \u2212 f_i(S_t)| \u2264 \u0394(S_t)/3, then the empirical IRV elimination order equals the true order (hence the sample winner equals the true winner). Why useful: yields an exact-winner guarantee when \u0393 is bounded away from 0.\n  Sketch: For each S_t, the identity of argmin_i f_i(S_t) is preserved since any perturbation \u2264 \u0394(S_t)/3 cannot change which coordinate is strictly smallest.\n\n- Lemma 2 (One-round repair by adding ballots). For any set S and candidates a,b\u2208S, if f_a(S) \u2264 f_b(S) and we add an \u03b1-fraction of new ballots all ranking a first among S, then in the new electorate P\u2032 (mixture with weight \u03b1) we have f\u2032_a(S) \u2212 f\u2032_b(S) = [f_a(S) \u2212 f_b(S) + \u03b1]/(1+\u03b1). In particular, choosing \u03b1 \u2265 f_b(S) \u2212 f_a(S) ensures f\u2032_a(S) \u2265 f\u2032_b(S). Why useful: provides a clean bound on how much additive mass is needed to flip a single elimination comparison.\n\n- Lemma 3 (Bounding the cost of a mistaken elimination). Suppose for a given S, the empirical min is r\u0302 while the true min is r. If max_i |\\hat f_i(S) \u2212 f_i(S)| \u2264 \u03b7, then f_{r\u0302}(S) \u2212 f_r(S) \u2264 2\u03b7. Hence, by Lemma 2, adding \u03b1 \u2264 2\u03b7 suffices to force elimination of r\u0302 instead of r at S. Why useful: quantifies the \u03b5-cost per round of a wrong elimination due to sampling noise.\n\n# Main Proposition (Upper bound for \u03b5-winner via the natural algorithm)\n\nProposition. Let CH be the event that for every round\u2019s remaining set in the true path (S_1,\u2026,S_K) and in the empirical path (\u015c_1,\u2026,\u015c_K), the deviations satisfy max_i |\\hat f_i(S) \u2212 f_i(S)| \u2264 \u03b7. On CH, the sample winner \u0109 is an \u03b5-winner with \u03b5 \u2264 2(K\u22121)\u03b7. Consequently, with probability \u2265 1\u2212\u03b4,\n- \u03b5 \u2264 2(K\u22121) \u03b7 where \u03b7 = sqrt{ (1/(2m)) log(4 K^2/\u03b4) }.\nEquivalently, it suffices that\n- m \u2265 (2 (K\u22121)^2 / \u03b5^2) \u00b7 log(4 K^2/\u03b4)\nfor the natural algorithm to output an \u03b5-winner w.p. \u2265 1\u2212\u03b4.\n\nProof sketch: Traverse the empirical elimination path backwards from \u0109. Whenever the empirical path\u2019s next eliminated candidate at some \u015c differs from the true eliminated candidate, apply Lemma 3 and then Lemma 2 to add \u2264 2\u03b7 mass to force the empirical choice on the true electorate. There are \u2264 K\u22121 rounds, so total added mass \u2264 2(K\u22121)\u03b7. For the probabilistic bound, each \\hat f_i(S) is an average of m i.i.d. indicators; Hoeffding gives P(|\\hat f_i(S)\u2212f_i(S)|>\u03b7) \u2264 2e^{\u22122m\u03b7^2}. Across at most sum_t |S_t| + sum_t |\u015c_t| \u2264 K(K+1) \u2264 2K^2 coordinates, a union bound yields P(CH^c) \u2264 4 K^2 e^{\u22122 m \u03b7^2}. Solve for \u03b7 in terms of \u03b4.\n\n# Corollaries / Special cases\n\n- Exact-winner under margins. If \u0393 = min_t \u0394(S_t) > 0, choosing \u03b7 \u2264 \u0393/3 in Lemma 1 and union-bounding over the K(K+1)/2 true-path coordinates yields m \u2265 (1/(2 \u0393^2)) \u00b7 log(2 K^2/\u03b4) to recover the exact winner w.p. \u2265 1\u2212\u03b4.\n- Dimension-agnostic statement. The \u03b5-winner guarantee above scales as m = O((K^2/\u03b5^2) log(K/\u03b4)), independent of hidden \u201csubset\u201d combinatorics.\n\n# Examples / Sanity checks\n\n- K=2 (plurality). The bound reduces to m = O((1/\u03b5^2) log(1/\u03b4)), matching the known optimal rate (up to constants), since K\u22121=1.\n- Near-tie chain. If each round\u2019s min-vs-second-min gap is about 2\u03b5/K, then our bound predicts \u03b7 \u2248 \u03b5/K is necessary, hence m \u2248 \u03a9(K^2/\u03b5^2), consistent with intuition that many rounds may need \u201crepair\u201d.\n\n# Obstacles / Gaps\n\n- Tie-breaking: Our lemmas assume strict inequalities; with deterministic tie-breaking, the \u0394(S) can be 0. The \u03b5-winner guarantee remains valid because any elimination reversal due to a tie can be repaired with arbitrarily small \u03b1>0, fitting within the 2\u03b7 per-round budget. For exact-winner recovery, \u0393=0 prevents stability without further assumptions.\n- Adaptivity: While we union-bounded across coordinates for both true and empirical paths, those sets are data-dependent. We sidestepped exponential unions by noting there are \u2264 K(K+1) coordinates realized along both paths. This is valid because Hoeffding\u2019s bound applies to any fixed coordinate a posteriori, and union bound over a superset of at most 2K^2 coordinates controls all coordinates that could appear.\n- Lower bound: A formal minimax lower bound for the \u201csample-IRV\u201d algorithm matching the O(K^2/\u03b5^2) upper bound is not yet proven here. The sketched hard family would create a chain of K\u22121 near-ties so that typical sampling noise of order \u03b7 flips \u03a9(K) eliminations, forcing >\u03b5 added mass to realize \u0109. This requires careful anti-concentration and coupling to ensure multiple mistaken eliminations happen with nontrivial probability.\n\n# Next steps\n\n- Formalize Lemma 2 with precise normalization for added ballots (mixture model) and extend to sequences of rounds rigorously (composition of additions while tracking renormalization by 1+\u03b1).\n- Give a full proof of the Proposition with explicit constants, including the case where some rounds are ties under P.\n- Construct and analyze a concrete lower-bound instance parameterized by K and \u03b5 to show that m = \u03a9((K^2/\u03b5^2)) samples are necessary for the \u201crun-IRV-on-sample\u201d algorithm to output an \u03b5-winner with high probability.\n- Empirical validation: small-K simulations to estimate the dependence on K and constants in the \u03b5 \u2248 2(K\u22121)\u03b7 relationship.\n- Check literature for related stability/margin-of-victory results for IRV (e.g., audit margins) that might tighten the per-round 2\u03b7 bound or reduce K-dependence via path-aware aggregation of deficits.\n\n# Gaps in output.md\n\n- No curated results yet. The lemmas and proposition above are candidates to be added after full proofs are written and constants verified."
