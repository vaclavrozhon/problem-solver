  "summary_md": "This round analyzed sample complexity and certificates for finding an \u03b5-winner under IRV. Main positive result: for K=3, running IRV on m \u2265 (2/\u03b5^2)\u00b7ln(18/\u03b4) i.i.d. ballots yields the sample winner c\u0302 which is an \u03b5-winner with probability \u22651\u2212\u03b4 (Hoeffding + union bound over 9 top-of-set events). We proved a correct uniform sufficient certificate: if for every S\u2287{c}, p_c(S) \u2265 min_{a\u2208S\\{c}} p_a(S) \u2212 \u03b5 then c is an \u03b5-winner. We also found the previously proposed single-chain certificate is unsound for K\u22654 (the elimination path after augmentation can visit sets off the chosen chain). Lower bounds: K=2 requires m = \u03a9((1/\u03b5^2)\u00b7log(1/\u03b4)); a Fano-type construction suggests m = \u03a9((log K)/\u03b5^2) to identify a unique \u03b5-winner among K (to be formalized). Two practical approaches were proposed\u2014(i) one-phase uniform control (union bound over K\u00b72^{K\u22121} top-of-set indicators, computationally exponential but adds only \u0398(K) in the log factor of m), and (ii) a two-phase holdout max-deficit certificate (correct but computationally heavy).
