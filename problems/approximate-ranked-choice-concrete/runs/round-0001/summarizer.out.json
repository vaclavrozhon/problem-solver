  "summary_md": "Round summary: Prover-01 proposed a clean path-wise certificate for IRV: express feasibility of a sample elimination path \u03c3 as finitely many linear inequalities d_{r,y}(P) \u2265 0, proved a K=3 concrete \u03b5-winner certificate, and gave a general-K certificate showing that if all empirical margins along the sample path exceed 2\u03b5 and all d_{r,y} concentrate to within \u03b5, then the sample winner is an \u03b5-winner. Counting the family yields U = K(K\u22121)2^{K\u22122}, so uniform Hoeffding gives m = O((K + log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2) to certify-or-abstain. Prover-02 gave an alternate \u2018\u2018per-round repair\u2019\u2019 approach: lemmas bounding how much added mass flips an elimination and a high-probability bound that the sample winner is an \u03b5-winner with m = O((K^2/\u03b5^2) log(K/\u03b4)). The verifier reconciled the approaches: the certificate approach is sound but must use the correct mixture normalization (P+\u03b1Q)/(1+\u03b1); the correct uniform concentration class size is \u0398(K) (not K^2); and repairs should use a single Q consistent with the sample path. Immediate next tasks are formal proofs (with corrected algebra), a K=3 Le Cam lower bound, and sharper K-dependence lower bounds.",
  "highlights": [
    "Path-wise certificate: feasibility of a sample elimination path can be encoded by linear forms d_{r,y}(P); preserving them after adding an \u03b1-fraction of ballots yields an \u03b5-winner certificate.",
    "K=3: concrete certificate with two statistics (first-choice elimination slack and final pairwise margin); m = \u0398((log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2) suffices by Hoeffding.",
    "General K certificate: family size U = \u03a3_{s=2}^K C(K,s) s(s\u22121) = K(K\u22121)2^{K\u22122}, so uniform concentration costs O((K + log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2) samples for a certify-or-abstain guarantee.",
    "Per-round repair viewpoint: adding mass \u2264 2\u03b7 per mistaken round can repair empirical eliminations; composing gives an \u03b5 budget \u2264 2(K\u22121)\u03b7 and a bound m = O((K^2/\u03b5^2) log(K/\u03b4)) under the approach as presented.",
    "Verifier fixes: use mixture P'=(P+\u03b1Q)/(1+\u03b1) in algebra; concentration must be uniform over the class of d_{r,y} (\u0398(K) log-size), and repairs should be realized by one Q matching the sample path."
