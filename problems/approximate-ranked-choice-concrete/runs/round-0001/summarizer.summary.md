This round analyzed sample complexity and certificates for finding an ε-winner under IRV. Main positive result: for K=3, running IRV on m ≥ (2/ε^2)·ln(18/δ) i.i.d. ballots yields the sample winner ĉ which is an ε-winner with probability ≥1−δ (Hoeffding + union bound over 9 top-of-set events). We proved a correct uniform sufficient certificate: if for every S⊇{c}, p_c(S) ≥ min_{a∈S\{c}} p_a(S) − ε then c is an ε-winner. We also found the previously proposed single-chain certificate is unsound for K≥4 (the elimination path after augmentation can visit sets off the chosen chain). Lower bounds: K=2 requires m = Ω((1/ε^2)·log(1/δ)); a Fano-type construction suggests m = Ω((log K)/ε^2) to identify a unique ε-winner among K (to be formalized). Two practical approaches were proposed—(i) one-phase uniform control (union bound over K·2^{K−1} top-of-set indicators, computationally exponential but adds only Θ(K) in the log factor of m), and (ii) a two-phase holdout max-deficit certificate (correct but computationally heavy).
