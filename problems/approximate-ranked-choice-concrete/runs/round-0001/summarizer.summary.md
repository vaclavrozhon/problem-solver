Round summary: Prover-01 proposed a clean path-wise certificate for IRV: express feasibility of a sample elimination path σ as finitely many linear inequalities d_{r,y}(P) ≥ 0, proved a K=3 concrete ε-winner certificate, and gave a general-K certificate showing that if all empirical margins along the sample path exceed 2ε and all d_{r,y} concentrate to within ε, then the sample winner is an ε-winner. Counting the family yields U = K(K−1)2^{K−2}, so uniform Hoeffding gives m = O((K + log(1/δ))/ε^2) to certify-or-abstain. Prover-02 gave an alternate ‘‘per-round repair’’ approach: lemmas bounding how much added mass flips an elimination and a high-probability bound that the sample winner is an ε-winner with m = O((K^2/ε^2) log(K/δ)). The verifier reconciled the approaches: the certificate approach is sound but must use the correct mixture normalization (P+αQ)/(1+α); the correct uniform concentration class size is Θ(K) (not K^2); and repairs should use a single Q consistent with the sample path. Immediate next tasks are formal proofs (with corrected algebra), a K=3 Le Cam lower bound, and sharper K-dependence lower bounds.
