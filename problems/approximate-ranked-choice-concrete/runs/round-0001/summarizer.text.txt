  "summary_md": "Round summary: Prover-01 proposed a clean path-wise certificate for IRV: express feasibility of a sample elimination path σ as finitely many linear inequalities d_{r,y}(P) ≥ 0, proved a K=3 concrete ε-winner certificate, and gave a general-K certificate showing that if all empirical margins along the sample path exceed 2ε and all d_{r,y} concentrate to within ε, then the sample winner is an ε-winner. Counting the family yields U = K(K−1)2^{K−2}, so uniform Hoeffding gives m = O((K + log(1/δ))/ε^2) to certify-or-abstain. Prover-02 gave an alternate ‘‘per-round repair’’ approach: lemmas bounding how much added mass flips an elimination and a high-probability bound that the sample winner is an ε-winner with m = O((K^2/ε^2) log(K/δ)). The verifier reconciled the approaches: the certificate approach is sound but must use the correct mixture normalization (P+αQ)/(1+α); the correct uniform concentration class size is Θ(K) (not K^2); and repairs should use a single Q consistent with the sample path. Immediate next tasks are formal proofs (with corrected algebra), a K=3 Le Cam lower bound, and sharper K-dependence lower bounds.",

    "Path-wise certificate: feasibility of a sample elimination path can be encoded by linear forms d_{r,y}(P); preserving them after adding an α-fraction of ballots yields an ε-winner certificate.",
    "K=3: concrete certificate with two statistics (first-choice elimination slack and final pairwise margin); m = Θ((log(1/δ))/ε^2) suffices by Hoeffding.",
    "General K certificate: family size U = Σ_{s=2}^K C(K,s) s(s−1) = K(K−1)2^{K−2}, so uniform concentration costs O((K + log(1/δ))/ε^2) samples for a certify-or-abstain guarantee.",
    "Per-round repair viewpoint: adding mass ≤ 2η per mistaken round can repair empirical eliminations; composing gives an ε budget ≤ 2(K−1)η and a bound m = O((K^2/ε^2) log(K/δ)) under the approach as presented.",
    "Verifier fixes: use mixture P'=(P+αQ)/(1+α) in algebra; concentration must be uniform over the class of d_{r,y} (Θ(K) log-size), and repairs should be realized by one Q matching the sample path."
