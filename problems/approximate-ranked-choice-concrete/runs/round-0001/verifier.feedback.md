High-level: Prover 01’s certificate-based approach is promising and largely correct once the “addition of ballots” model is handled carefully. Prover 02’s per-round repair argument has significant rigor gaps (both in the concentration step over data-dependent sets and in composing repairs across rounds with a single set of added ballots). Below are detailed audits and concrete next steps.

Prover 01
- Strengths: The path-wise certification via linear inequalities d_{r,y} is a clean and powerful way to reason about IRV. The counting identity U = Σ_{s=2}^K C(K,s) s(s−1) = K(K−1)2^{K−2} is correct, so log U = Θ(K), giving a uniform concentration price only linear in K. The main idea—run IRV on the sample; if all empirical margins along the sample path are ≥ 2ε, then with high probability the sample winner is an ε-winner—is sound.
- Fixes needed: (i) The problem defines ε-winner by adding an ε-fraction of new ballots. The correct mixture after adding α fraction is P′ = (P + α Q)/(1+α), not (1−α)P + α Q. Your algebra should use the 1/(1+α) normalization. Fortunately, the certificate still works: if d_{r,y}(P) ≥ ε and α=ε, then d_{r,y}(P′) ≥ ε/(1+ε) > 0 for y ≠ w, and equals (ε+ε)/(1+ε) for y=w. (ii) In your general-K proof, the “unique y_r with d_{r,y_r}(Q)=1” is indeed y_r = w for every round; it is worth stating explicitly. (iii) State the result as a certify-or-abstain guarantee: with m ≥ C (K+log(1/δ))/ε^2, with prob ≥ 1−δ, either some empirical margin < 2ε (no certificate), or the sample winner is an ε-winner.
- Next steps: Write the full proof with the additive model and a clear uniform concentration lemma over the class of all d_{r,y} functionals; include the counting identity. Optionally, add the K=3 corollary where only O(1) statistics suffice.

Prover 02
- Concentration/adaptivity issue: The set of coordinates you union-bound over (those appearing along the true and empirical paths) is data-dependent. A priori, one must control deviations uniformly over the entire class F = { indicators “top among A is x” } (or differences thereof). This class has cardinality K·2^{K−1} (or K(K−1)2^{K−2} for differences), so one pays only log-size Θ(K), not K^2. The proposed union bound over ≈2K^2 realized coordinates is not justified as stated.
- Composition of repairs: The per-round “add ≤ 2η mass” does not by itself ensure existence of a single set Q of added ballots that makes all rounds follow the empirical elimination path simultaneously. The clean way is to set Q to a single ranking consistent with the sample elimination order (as in Prover 01) and verify all inequalities together. The backward, round-by-round repair must track renormalizations and cross-effects; otherwise the total ε budget is not rigorously established.
- Recommendation: Recast your main proposition using the path-wise certificate: On the high-probability uniform concentration event, deficits per round are at most η; if empirical margins are ≥ 2η, the certificate holds with ε = η. If you aim to avoid the empirical-margin condition, you will need to parameterize by the true path’s minimal gap Γ and give guarantees in terms of Γ.

Lower bounds and open directions
- K=3: A Le Cam two-point lower bound of Ω((log(1/δ))/ε^2) is standard; formalize it with instances differing by a pairwise margin while keeping early elimination fixed.
- K-dependence: For the natural algorithm, seek constructions where exactly one round’s critical constraint is hidden among Θ(K) possibilities to argue Ω((log K)/ε^2) or better. Try also families with a chain of near-ties to probe whether Ω(K/ε^2) is necessary.
- Deliverables: (1) A formal theorem/lemma package for the path-wise certificate with additive ballots and uniform concentration; (2) a clean K=3 statement; (3) at least the basic lower bound for K=3.
