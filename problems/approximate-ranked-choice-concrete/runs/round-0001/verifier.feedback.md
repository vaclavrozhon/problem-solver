High-level: There’s a solid start (clean notation, sampling model, and a plausible analysis path). The K=3 case is essentially correct up to constants, but the general “chain certificate” (Lemma 1) is not yet rigorous for K≥4. Proposition 3 depends on Lemma 1 and therefore is not currently justified. Below are specific audits and suggested next steps.

1) Lemma 1 (chain certificate): The proof only checks inequalities along one prescribed chain S_K ⊃ S_{K−1} ⊃ … ⊃ S_2. IRV’s actual elimination path after adding ε mass to c is uniquely determined by tallies and the fixed tie-breaking rule and generally need not follow that chain. Showing that c is not eliminated along one particular chain does not imply c survives the actual path unless one proves that, for every set S encountered along the actual path, c’s tally is ≥ the minimum among others. The current argument does not establish that property for sets not on the chosen chain. Thus, for K≥4 the lemma is not a valid sufficient condition as stated. A correct sufficient certificate would require: for every S⊇{c}, p_c(S) ≥ min_{a∈S\{c}} p_a(S) − ε (plus a tie-handling convention). This is stronger (2^{K−1} checks) but correct.

2) K=3 bound (Proposition 2): The approach is sound, but the stated constant is off. With α=√(ln(18/δ)/(2m)), enforcing 2α ≤ ε gives m ≥ (2/ε^2)·ln(18/δ), not (8/ε^2). The proof should also explicitly note that we add ε mass of c-first ballots (compare absolute tallies, not renormalized shares), so others’ counts are unchanged for all S containing c.

3) Split-sample bound (Proposition 3): Conditioning on the phase-1 chain does remove adaptivity in estimation, but relying only on comparisons versus b̂_t along that single chain does not guarantee ĉ survives the actual (post-augmentation) elimination path for K≥4. To fix this, the phase-2 verification must ensure, for every round-set S that may be encountered by the elimination rule under the augmented profile, that p_c(S)+ε ≥ min_{a≠c} p_a(S). A computationally heavy but valid approach is to verify this for all S⊇{ĉ} on the holdout sample (uniform deviation via Hoeffding + union bound over K·2^{K−1} indicators).

4) Lower bounds: The K=2 Le Cam lower bound is correct in order. The Fano sketch is plausible; it needs an explicit IRV-compatible construction and the proof that each instance has a unique ε/4-winner.

Concrete next steps:
- Repair Lemma 1 or replace it with a correct certificate (uniform over all S⊇{c}). Provide a minimal counterexample or proof of impossibility of single-chain certificates for K≥4.
- Finalize and write a rigorous proof for K=3 with corrected constants and explicit tie handling.
- For general K, either: (a) analyze the natural one-phase algorithm via a uniform union bound over all (S,a) to control adaptivity and then prove a statement that connects these uniform bounds to ε-winner status; or (b) adopt a two-phase “certify-by-max-deficit” algorithm: on holdout, compute B̃(c)=max_{S⊇{c}}(min_{a∈S\{c}} p̃_a(S)−p̃_c(S)), and output any c with B̃(c) ≤ ε/2.
- Formalize the Ω((log K)/ε^2) Fano lower bound.
