K=3: The natural sample-and-run-IRV algorithm succeeds with m ≥ (2/ε^2)·ln(18/δ); proof via Hoeffding + union bound over 9 top-of-set frequencies and robustness to adding ε mass of c-first ballots. General K: the proposed single-chain ε-certificate (Lemma 1) is not sound; Proposition 3 depends on it and is unproven. Suggest replacing with a uniform-over-all-S certificate (computationally heavy but correct) or reworking analysis. Lower bounds: K=2 order-optimal Ω((1/ε^2)·log(1/δ)) is fine; Fano Ω((log K)/ε^2) needs full construction.
