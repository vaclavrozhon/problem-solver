We validated a rigorous, path-wise certification theorem for IRV: if the sampled elimination path has empirical slack ≥ 2ε in every round, then with m ≥ C (K + log(1/δ))/ε^2, with probability ≥ 1−δ the sample winner is an ε-winner of the true election. The proof rests on uniform Hoeffding concentration over the class of top-among-subset functionals (size K(K−1)2^{K−2}) and a single added-ballot profile consistent with the sample’s elimination order. We corrected the mixture model to the additive-ballot semantics and clarified the effect of the added ballots on per-round inequalities. We also identified major issues in a competing per-round “repair” approach (data-dependent union bound and composition of repairs) and suggested aligning it with the path-wise certificate. Next: finalize the theorem and proofs into output.md, and develop matching lower bounds (K=3 via two-point method; K-dependence constructions).
