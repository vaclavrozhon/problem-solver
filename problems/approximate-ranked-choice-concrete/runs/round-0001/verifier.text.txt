  "feedback_md": "High-level: Prover 01’s certificate-based approach is promising and largely correct once the “addition of ballots” model is handled carefully. Prover 02’s per-round repair argument has significant rigor gaps (both in the concentration step over data-dependent sets and in composing repairs across rounds with a single set of added ballots). Below are detailed audits and concrete next steps.\n\nProver 01\n- Strengths: The path-wise certification via linear inequalities d_{r,y} is a clean and powerful way to reason about IRV. The counting identity U = Σ_{s=2}^K C(K,s) s(s−1) = K(K−1)2^{K−2} is correct, so log U = Θ(K), giving a uniform concentration price only linear in K. The main idea—run IRV on the sample; if all empirical margins along the sample path are ≥ 2ε, then with high probability the sample winner is an ε-winner—is sound.\n- Fixes needed: (i) The problem defines ε-winner by adding an ε-fraction of new ballots. The correct mixture after adding α fraction is P′ = (P + α Q)/(1+α), not (1−α)P + α Q. Your algebra should use the 1/(1+α) normalization. Fortunately, the certificate still works: if d_{r,y}(P) ≥ ε and α=ε, then d_{r,y}(P′) ≥ ε/(1+ε) > 0 for y ≠ w, and equals (ε+ε)/(1+ε) for y=w. (ii) In your general-K proof, the “unique y_r with d_{r,y_r}(Q)=1” is indeed y_r = w for every round; it is worth stating explicitly. (iii) State the result as a certify-or-abstain guarantee: with m ≥ C (K+log(1/δ))/ε^2, with prob ≥ 1−δ, either some empirical margin < 2ε (no certificate), or the sample winner is an ε-winner.\n- Next steps: Write the full proof with the additive model and a clear uniform concentration lemma over the class of all d_{r,y} functionals; include the counting identity. Optionally, add the K=3 corollary where only O(1) statistics suffice.\n\nProver 02\n- Concentration/adaptivity issue: The set of coordinates you union-bound over (those appearing along the true and empirical paths) is data-dependent. A priori, one must control deviations uniformly over the entire class F = { indicators “top among A is x” } (or differences thereof). This class has cardinality K·2^{K−1} (or K(K−1)2^{K−2} for differences), so one pays only log-size Θ(K), not K^2. The proposed union bound over ≈2K^2 realized coordinates is not justified as stated.\n- Composition of repairs: The per-round “add ≤ 2η mass” does not by itself ensure existence of a single set Q of added ballots that makes all rounds follow the empirical elimination path simultaneously. The clean way is to set Q to a single ranking consistent with the sample elimination order (as in Prover 01) and verify all inequalities together. The backward, round-by-round repair must track renormalizations and cross-effects; otherwise the total ε budget is not rigorously established.\n- Recommendation: Recast your main proposition using the path-wise certificate: On the high-probability uniform concentration event, deficits per round are at most η; if empirical margins are ≥ 2η, the certificate holds with ε = η. If you aim to avoid the empirical-margin condition, you will need to parameterize by the true path’s minimal gap Γ and give guarantees in terms of Γ.\n\nLower bounds and open directions\n- K=3: A Le Cam two-point lower bound of Ω((log(1/δ))/ε^2) is standard; formalize it with instances differing by a pairwise margin while keeping early elimination fixed.\n- K-dependence: For the natural algorithm, seek constructions where exactly one round’s critical constraint is hidden among Θ(K) possibilities to argue Ω((log K)/ε^2) or better. Try also families with a chain of near-ties to probe whether Ω(K/ε^2) is necessary.\n- Deliverables: (1) A formal theorem/lemma package for the path-wise certificate with additive ballots and uniform concentration; (2) a clean K=3 statement; (3) at least the basic lower bound for K=3.\n",
  "summary_md": "We validated a rigorous, path-wise certification theorem for IRV: if the sampled elimination path has empirical slack ≥ 2ε in every round, then with m ≥ C (K + log(1/δ))/ε^2, with probability ≥ 1−δ the sample winner is an ε-winner of the true election. The proof rests on uniform Hoeffding concentration over the class of top-among-subset functionals (size K(K−1)2^{K−2}) and a single added-ballot profile consistent with the sample’s elimination order. We corrected the mixture model to the additive-ballot semantics and clarified the effect of the added ballots on per-round inequalities. We also identified major issues in a competing per-round “repair” approach (data-dependent union bound and composition of repairs) and suggested aligning it with the path-wise certificate. Next: finalize the theorem and proofs into output.md, and develop matching lower bounds (K=3 via two-point method; K-dependence constructions).",

For a fixed elimination order σ = (e_1, e_2, …, e_{K-1}, w), define A_r := [K] \\ {e_1,…,e_{r-1}} and, for each y ∈ A_r \\ {e_r}, the margin functional d_{r,y}(P) := score_y(P; A_r) − score_{e_r}(P; A_r).\n- Feasibility of σ under P is equivalent to d_{r,y}(P) ≥ 0 for all r and y; ties are broken by a fixed rule consistent with σ.\n- Certificate distribution: Let R be the full ranking that lists candidates in the order (w, e_{K−1}, e_{K−2}, …, e_1). Let Q be the point mass on R. Under Q, for every round r, e_r is never top among A_r (so score_{e_r}(Q; A_r)=0). The top among A_r is always w, hence d_{r,y}(Q) = 1 if y=w and 0 otherwise.\n- Additive-ballot model: Adding an α-fraction of additional ballots from Q transforms P into P′ := (P + α Q)/(1+α). For any linear functional ℓ, ℓ(P′) = (ℓ(P) + α ℓ(Q))/(1+α).\n- Uniform concentration: The family of functionals F := { (A, y, x) ↦ score_y(·; A) − score_x(·; A) : A ⊆ [K], |A|≥2, y≠x∈A } has cardinality U = Σ_{s=2}^K C(K,s) s(s−1) = K(K−1) 2^{K−2}. Hoeffding plus a union bound yields that with m ≥ C (log U + log(1/δ))/ε^2 = C' (K + log(1/δ))/ε^2, we have |ℓ(S) − ℓ(P)| ≤ ε for all ℓ ∈ F w.p. ≥ 1−δ.\n- Path-wise certificate (informal): If IRV run on the sample S produces σ, and d_{r,y}(S) ≥ 2ε for all r,y on that path, then on the uniform concentration event, d_{r,y}(P) ≥ ε. Adding α=ε fraction of ballots from Q makes d_{r,y}(P′) ≥ ε/(1+ε) for y≠w and ≥ (ε+ε)/(1+ε) for y=w, so σ is feasible on P′ and w wins. Thus w is an ε-winner.\n\nRemarks and contrasts\n- This approach controls adaptivity: we concentrate uniformly over all d_{r,y}, so the random sets A_r along the sample path pose no extra difficulty.\n- A previously suggested per-round “repair by adding ≤ 2η mass” must be reformulated as a single added distribution Q (e.g., the ranking R above). Sequential repairs are hard to compose rigorously due to renormalization and cross-effects.\n- Identity check: Σ_{s} C(K,s) s(s−1) = K(K−1) 2^{K−2} follows from evaluating E[S(S−1)] for S∼Bin(K,1/2).\n\nNext targets\n- Write a clean theorem: with m ≥ C (K+log(1/δ))/ε^2, with prob ≥ 1−δ, either some empirical margin < 2ε (no certificate), or the sample winner is an ε-winner. Provide full proof under the additive-ballot model.\n- K=3 specialization: Only a constant number of statistics (first-round shares and final pairwise margin) are needed; present the explicit certificate and concentration.\n- Lower bounds: (i) K=3 two-point lower bound Ω((log(1/δ))/ε^2); (ii) constructions probing K-dependence (hidden near-tie constraints; chains of near-ties).\n"

We provide a path-wise certificate that, when triggered, guarantees that w is an ε-winner of the true election with high probability.\n\nDefinitions. For any subset A⊆[K] with |A|≥2 and x∈A, let\n- score_x(P; A) := Pr_{b∼P}[x is the top-ranked among A on ballot b].\nFor a fixed elimination order σ=(e_1,…,e_{K−1}, w), set A_r := [K] \\ {e_1,…,e_{r−1}} and, for each y∈A_r\\{e_r}, define the margin functional\n- d_{r,y}(P) := score_y(P; A_r) − score_{e_r}(P; A_r).\nWe say that σ is feasible under P if d_{r,y}(P) ≥ 0 for all r and y (with a fixed deterministic tie-breaking rule consistent with σ).\n\nWe adopt the additive-ballot model for ε-winner: a candidate c is an ε-winner for P if there exists a distribution Q over full rankings and α∈[0,ε] such that, in the profile P′ := (P + α Q)/(1+α), candidate c wins under IRV.\n\nLemma 1 (Uniform concentration of path functionals). Let\nU := Σ_{s=2}^K C(K,s) s(s−1) = K(K−1) 2^{K−2}.\nFor any ε∈(0,1) and δ∈(0,1), if m ≥ (1/(2ε^2))(log(2U)+log(1/δ)), then with probability at least 1−δ, simultaneously for all subsets A and ordered pairs (y,x) with y≠x∈A,\n| (score_y(S; A) − score_x(S; A)) − (score_y(P; A) − score_x(P; A)) | ≤ ε.\nProof. Each difference is an average of m i.i.d. variables in [−1,1]. Apply Hoeffding’s inequality and a union bound over the U functionals and their negations. The identity for U follows by evaluating E[S(S−1)] for S∼Bin(K,1/2).\n\nLemma 2 (Certificate via adding a single ranking). Fix σ=(e_1,…,e_{K−1}, w). Let R be the full ranking that orders candidates as (w, e_{K−1}, e_{K−2}, …, e_1), and let Q be the point mass on R. For every round r and every y∈A_r\\{e_r}, under Q we have score_{e_r}(Q; A_r)=0 and\n- d_{r,y}(Q) = 1 if y = w,\n- d_{r,y}(Q) = 0 if y ≠ w.\nConsequently, for any α≥0 and any P, in P′:=(P+αQ)/(1+α),\n- d_{r,y}(P′) = (d_{r,y}(P) + α d_{r,y}(Q))/(1+α).\n\nTheorem 1 (Path-wise ε-winner certificate for IRV). Fix ε∈(0,1/2) and δ∈(0,1). Draw m ballots i.i.d. from P to form the empirical profile S, and run IRV on S to obtain an elimination order σ and winner w. If m ≥ C (K + log(1/δ))/ε^2 for a suitable absolute constant C, then with probability at least 1−δ, the following implication holds:\nIf d_{r,y}(S) ≥ 2ε for every round r and every y∈A_r\\{e_r}, then w is an ε-winner for P.\nProof. By Lemma 1 (absorbing constants into C), with probability ≥1−δ we have |d_{r,y}(S) − d_{r,y}(P)| ≤ ε uniformly over all (A,y,x). On this event, for all r and y we get d_{r,y}(P) ≥ ε. Let Q be as in Lemma 2 and take α=ε. Then for y≠w, d_{r,y}(P′) = (d_{r,y}(P) + 0·ε)/(1+ε) ≥ ε/(1+ε) > 0; for y=w, d_{r,w}(P′) = (d_{r,w}(P) + ε·1)/(1+ε) ≥ (ε+ε)/(1+ε) > 0. Hence all feasibility inequalities for σ hold in P′, so w wins under IRV in P′. By definition, w is an ε-winner for P.\n\nCorollary 2 (K=3, explicit certificate). For K=3, let the sample S have elimination order (e, o, w). If the empirical first-round margins satisfy score_e(S;[3]) ≤ min(score_o(S;[3]), score_w(S;[3])) − 2ε and the final pairwise margin satisfies Pr_S[w ≻ o] − Pr_S[o ≻ w] ≥ 2ε, then for m ≥ C' (log(1/δ))/ε^2 (for a suitable constant C'), with probability ≥1−δ the candidate w is an ε-winner of P. Proof: specialize Theorem 1 to K=3; only O(1) functionals are needed for concentration in this case.\n\nDiscussion. The theorem gives a certify-or-abstain guarantee for the natural algorithm: whenever the observed sample path has per-round slack at least 2ε, the sample winner is an ε-winner of the true election with high probability from m = O((K+log(1/δ))/ε^2) samples. The uniform concentration over all path functionals resolves adaptivity of the random elimination sets.\n"
