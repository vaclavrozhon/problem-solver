# Main Results



- K=3 upper bound (natural algorithm): If m ≥ (2/ε^2)·ln(18/δ), then with probability ≥ 1−δ the sample IRV winner is an ε-winner.
- Baseline lower bound (K=2): Any algorithm needs m = Ω((1/ε^2)·log(1/δ)).
- General K: a single-chain certificate is insufficient; a correct sufficient certificate must hold uniformly over all S⊇{c}. Establishing tight bounds for the natural algorithm when K≥4 remains open.
