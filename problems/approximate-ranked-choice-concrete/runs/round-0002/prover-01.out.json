Define\nB(c) := max_{S\u2287{c}} [ min_{a\u2208S\\{c}} p_a(S) \u2212 p_c(S) ].\nIf B(c) \u2264 \u03b5 (with tie-breaking not eliminating c on ties after adding an infinitesimal slack), then c is an \u03b5-winner. In particular, adding \u03b5 fraction of c-first ballots suffices.\n\nProof. Adding \u03b5 of c-first ballots increases p_c(S) by \u03b5 for every S containing c and leaves p_a(S) for a\u2260c unchanged (we compare absolute tallies, not normalized shares). Hence for every S\u2287{c}: p\u2032_c(S) = p_c(S)+\u03b5 \u2265 min_{a\u2260c} p_a(S) = min_{a\u2260c} p\u2032_a(S). So c is never strictly below the minimum at any round encountered by IRV under the augmented profile, and therefore cannot be eliminated. \u220e\n\nRemark. This certificate is sufficient, not necessary: IRV\u2019s elimination path under augmentation might visit a strict subset of the S, allowing smaller \u03b5 to suffice.\n\nWhy useful here: It yields a verifiable condition turning the \u03b5-winner question into finitely many inequalities over S\u2287{c}.\n\n\n## 2) Counterexample: single-chain certificates fail for K\u22654\nWe exhibit a profile on C={a,b,c,d} where the \u201csingle-chain\u201d check (comparing only versus designated b_t along one chain) incorrectly certifies c, yet c does not win even after adding \u03b5 mass of c-first ballots.\n\nBallot types and weights:\n- T1: c>a>d>b with weight x=0.34.\n- T2: a>d>c>b with weight y=0.29.\n- T3: d>c>a>b with weight z=0.34.\n- T4: b>a>d>c with weight \u03b4=0.03.\nTotal 1.\n\nComputed tallies:\n- Full set C: p_c(C)=x=0.34, p_a(C)=y=0.29, p_d(C)=z=0.34, p_b(C)=\u03b4=0.03. First-round minimum is b.\n- On S={a,c,d}: T1\u2192c, T2\u2192a, T3\u2192d, T4\u2192a, so p_c=0.34, p_a=0.32, p_d=0.34. Minimum among others is a.\n- Pair {c,a}: c beats a, with p_c=x+z=0.68, p_a=y+\u03b4=0.32.\n- Pair {c,d}: c loses to d, with p_c=x=0.34, p_d=y+z+\u03b4=0.66.\n\nIRV elimination: remove b first (0.03), then on {a,c,d} remove a (0.32), leaving final pair {c,d}, where c loses. Thus c is not the winner.\n\nYet the \u201cchain\u201d that checks S=C (vs b), then S={a,c,d} (vs a), then pair {c,a} would (incorrectly) conclude that c can be made an \u03b5-winner with \u03b5\u22480.03: indeed at C we have p_c\u2212p_b=0.31, at {a,c,d} we have p_c\u2212p_a=0.02, and at {c,a} c wins handily. After adding \u03b5=0.03 fraction of c-first ballots, c still loses versus d in the final pair, so the chain certificate is false.\n\nTakeaway: Any certificate restricted to one elimination chain (and only comparing to chosen b_t rather than the round\u2019s true minimum) is unsound for K\u22654.\n\n\n## 3) Two-phase certification algorithm with sample complexity\nAlgorithm (holdout certificate for the sample winner):\n- Phase 1: Draw m1 ballots, run IRV to get c\u0302 (no guarantee needed in this phase).\n- Phase 2: Draw m2 fresh ballots. For all S\u2287{c\u0302} and a\u2208S\\{c\u0302}, estimate p\u0303_a(S), p\u0303_{c\u0302}(S). Compute B\u0303(c\u0302)=max_{S\u2287{c\u0302}}(min_{a\u2208S\\{c\u0302}} p\u0303_a(S)\u2212p\u0303_{c\u0302}(S)). If B\u0303(c\u0302) \u2264 \u03b5/2, output c\u0302.\n\nProposition 2. If m2 \u2265 (2/\u03b5^2)\u00b7ln(2K\u00b72^{K\u22121}/\u03b4), then with probability \u22651\u2212\u03b4, whenever Phase 2 outputs c\u0302, that c\u0302 is an \u03b5-winner.\n\nProof. Condition on Phase 1. For each fixed (S,a), the indicator g_{S,a}(ballot)=1[top_S(ballot)=a] has mean p_a(S). The total number of such functions with c\u0302 fixed is at most K\u00b72^{K\u22121} (each S\u2287{c\u0302}, each a\u2208S). Hoeffding plus union bound yields a uniform deviation |p\u0303_a(S)\u2212p_a(S)| \u2264 \u03b5/4 simultaneously for all those (S,a) with probability \u22651\u2212\u03b4 if m2\u2265(2/\u03b5^2)ln(2K\u00b72^{K\u22121}/\u03b4). Then B(c\u0302) \u2264 B\u0303(c\u0302)+\u03b5/2 \u2264 \u03b5, so Lemma 1 applies. \u220e\n\nComments:\n- This cleanly bypasses adaptivity: we fix c\u0302 and the family {g_{S,a}} before Phase 2.\n- Sample complexity m2 scales as O((K+log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2). Computationally, Phase 2 is exponential in K due to enumerating S.\n\n\n## 4) K=3: a provable guarantee under a mild separation condition\nLet C={c,a,b}. Write x*=argmax_{x\u2208{a,b}} p_x(C).\n\nProposition 3 (K=3 with separation). Suppose |p_a(C)\u2212p_b(C)| \u2265 \u03b3. Draw m i.i.d. ballots and run IRV on them to get c\u0302. If m \u2265 (8/\u03b5^2)\u00b7ln(18/\u03b4) and \u03b3 \u2265 \u03b5/2 (so that \u03b1:=\u221a(ln(18/\u03b4)/(2m)) \u2264 \u03b5/4 \u2264 \u03b3/2), then with probability \u22651\u2212\u03b4 the output c\u0302 is an \u03b5-winner of the true election.\n\nProof. Uniformly over the 9 quantities {p_x(S)} with S\u2208{C,{c,a},{c,b}} and x\u2208S, Hoeffding+union bound gives |p\u0302_x(S)\u2212p_x(S)| \u2264 \u03b1. Let x\u0302 be the more popular of {a,b} in the sample on S=C. By \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b3/2, we have x\u0302=x*. On the sample profile, since c\u0302 is the IRV winner, c\u0302 is not the minimum at C, and c\u0302 beats x\u0302 in the final pair. Hence p\u0302_{c\u0302}(C) \u2265 min_{y\u2208{a,b}} p\u0302_y(C), and p\u0302_{c\u0302}({c\u0302,x\u0302}) \u2265 p\u0302_{x\u0302}({c\u0302,x\u0302}). Transferring to truth: p_{c\u0302}(C) \u2265 min_{y} p_y(C) \u2212 2\u03b1 and p_{c\u0302}({c\u0302,x*}) \u2265 p_{x*}({c\u0302,x*}) \u2212 2\u03b1. Adding \u03b5\u22652\u03b1 mass of c\u0302-first ballots makes c\u0302 safe at C and win against x*; since x* is the true final opponent, c\u0302 wins IRV. \u220e\n\nRemarks.\n- Without the separation |p_a(C)\u2212p_b(C)| \u2265 \u03b3, the sample may misidentify the true final opponent, and bounding the (true) pair versus the actual final opponent from the sample winner alone is generally impossible.\n- This strengthens and corrects the K=3 discussion: the guarantee hinges on identifying the true final opponent at C.\n\n\n## 5) Lower bounds: refined statements to formalize\n- Two-candidate baseline. For K=2, deciding whether the output is an \u03b5-winner reduces to distinguishing Bernoulli means within \u03b5/2; any algorithm needs m=\u03a9((1/\u03b5^2)\u00b7log(1/\u03b4)).\n- Log-K Fano lower bound. Construct K instances over ballots where for each i the unique \u03b5/4-winner is i, with pairwise KL divergence \u0398(\u03b5^2). Then any algorithm that finds an \u03b5/2-winner with error \u2264\u03b4 needs m=\u03a9((log K)/\u03b5^2). We will provide an explicit IRV-compatible family and verify uniqueness of \u03b5/4-winner in each.\n\nWhy useful: Matches the O((K+log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2) upper order up to a linear vs logarithmic dependence on K, suggesting near-optimality unless \u03a9(K/\u03b5^2) can be shown.\n\n\n## 6) Obstacles and failed approaches\n- One-phase \u201cnatural algorithm\u201d (run IRV on the sample and directly output c\u0302) for K\u22654 remains challenging: the property \u201cc\u0302 is winner on the sample\u201d does not imply the uniform certificate B\u0302(c\u0302)\u22640; there can exist S not on the sample path where c\u0302 is below the minimum among others, and these S may become relevant under the true augmented process.\n- Attempted simplification \u201cpairs suffice\u201d is false in general: B(c) can be attained at a non-pair S because top-of-S constraints link more than two candidates (we have explicit constructions where triple deficits exceed any pair deficit). Hence checking only head-to-heads is insufficient.\n\n\n## 7) Next steps\n- Prove and record a compact \u201cuniform certificate \u21d2 \u03b5-winning\u201d theorem with explicit tie handling (reserve \u03b5/100 slack) suitable for proofs.md.\n- Optimize the holdout bound constants; tighten M in the union bound to \u2264(K\u22121)2^{K\u22122} by noting that for each S we only need the minimum among others rather than all a.\n- Explore whether B(c) is always achieved on an \u201cIRV-reachable\u201d set S along some elimination order; if true, it could reduce the 2^{K\u22121} blowup to polynomially many S. Either prove or give a counterexample.\n- Formalize the Fano lower bound with a concrete K-ary construction tailored to IRV.\n- For K=3, investigate whether the separation assumption can be relaxed by a small extra \u03b5 budget that simultaneously covers both possible final opponents.\n\n\n## 8) Small verification example (K=3)\nLet C={c,a,b}. Suppose p_a(C)=0.37, p_b(C)=0.31, p_c(C)=0.32 (so x*=a). Head-to-heads: p_c({c,a})=0.51, p_c({c,b})=0.60. Then B(c)=max{ (0.31\u22120.32), (0.49\u22120.51), (0.40\u22120.60) }^+=0.01, attained at S=C. Adding \u03b5=0.01 of c-first ballots makes c an IRV winner (remains above both at C, then beats a head-to-head). This illustrates the certificate and that the worst S need not be a pair."
