  "summary_md": "This round corrected a flawed \u2018\u2018single-chain\u2019\u2019 certificate and developed sound certificates and sample bounds for estimating IRV \u03b5-winners from samples. Main advances: an explicit K=4 counterexample showing chain-only checks can fail; a correct uniform max-deficit certificate B(c)=max_{S\u2287{c}}(min_{a\u2208S\\{c}} p_a(S)\u2212p_c(S)) (B(c)<\u03b5 \u21d2 c is an \u03b5-winner, equality needs tie-handling); a two-phase holdout certification with m2 \u2265 (2/\u03b5^2)\u00b7ln(2M/\u03b4) (M=(K\u22121)\u00b72^{K\u22122}+2^{K\u22121}); and a K=3 positive result under a separation assumption (m \u2265 (8/\u03b5^2)\u00b7ln(18/\u03b4), \u03b3 \u2265 \u03b5/2). Lower bound K=2: m = \u03a9((1/\u03b5^2)\u00b7ln(1/\u03b4)); a Fano-type \u03a9((log K)/\u03b5^2) lower bound is outlined but not yet formalized. Citations: Research Notes; Current Proofs.",

    "Single-chain certificate is unsound for K\u22654 \u2014 explicit K=4 counterexample (T1:0.34, T2:0.29, T3:0.34, T4:0.03) where chain checks pass but c loses.",
    "Uniform max-deficit certificate B(c)=max_{S\u2287{c}}(min_{a\u2260c} p_a(S)\u2212p_c(S)) is a correct sufficient condition: B(c)<\u03b5 \u21d2 c is \u03b5-winner (equality needs tie rules).",
    "Two-phase holdout algorithm: pick sample winner c\u0302 then estimate p_a(S) on a fresh holdout; with m2 \u2265 (2/\u03b5^2)\u00b7ln(2M/\u03b4) one can certify c\u0302 if B\u0303(c\u0302) \u2264 \u03b5/2\u2212\u03be.",
    "K=3 result (with separation): if |p_a(C)\u2212p_b(C)|\u2265\u03b3\u2265\u03b5/2 and m \u2265 (8/\u03b5^2)\u00b7ln(18/\u03b4), the sample IRV winner is an \u03b5-winner w.h.p.",
    "Controlling all top-of-set frequencies requires union bounding over ~K\u00b72^{K\u22121} indicators \u2014 computationally exponential but only adds a \u0398(K) term to the log factor in sample size.",
    "Lower bounds: K=2 is order-optimal \u03a9((1/\u03b5^2)\u00b7ln(1/\u03b4)); Fano suggests \u03a9((log K)/\u03b5^2) for general K, pending explicit IRV construction."
