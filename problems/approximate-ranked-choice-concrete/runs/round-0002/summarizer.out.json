  "summary_md": "This round audited and tightened the certify-or-abstain analysis for IRV under the additive-ballot model. Key fixes: explicitly note tie-breaking is irrelevant once all feasibility margins are strictly positive; give a simple combinatorial proof that U = K(K\u22121)2^{K\u22122} for the family of top-among-A score differences; and replace the fixed \u201c2\u03b5 \u2192 \u03b5\u201d rule by a parametrized certificate that decouples the empirical slack \u03c4 := min d_{r,y}(S) and the uniform deviation \u03b7 (aka \u03b3). The parametrized certificate yields a data-dependent certified robustness \u03b1\u0302 = (\u03c4 \u2212 \u03b7)_+. For K=3 we obtain an explicit finite list of functionals and an upper bound m = O((log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2) with concrete constants; a matching Le Cam two-point lower bound shows m = \u03a9((log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2). Remaining work: formalize constants in the K=3 lower bound, integrate the parametric statements into output.md, and pursue K-dependent lower bounds via packing/Fano.",
