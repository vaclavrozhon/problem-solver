This round audited and tightened the certify-or-abstain analysis for IRV under the additive-ballot model. Key fixes: explicitly note tie-breaking is irrelevant once all feasibility margins are strictly positive; give a simple combinatorial proof that U = K(K−1)2^{K−2} for the family of top-among-A score differences; and replace the fixed “2ε → ε” rule by a parametrized certificate that decouples the empirical slack τ := min d_{r,y}(S) and the uniform deviation η (aka γ). The parametrized certificate yields a data-dependent certified robustness α̂ = (τ − η)_+. For K=3 we obtain an explicit finite list of functionals and an upper bound m = O((log(1/δ))/ε^2) with concrete constants; a matching Le Cam two-point lower bound shows m = Ω((log(1/δ))/ε^2). Remaining work: formalize constants in the K=3 lower bound, integrate the parametric statements into output.md, and pursue K-dependent lower bounds via packing/Fano.
