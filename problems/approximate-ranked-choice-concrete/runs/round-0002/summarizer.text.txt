{"summary_md":"This round corrected a flawed ‘‘single-chain’’ certificate and developed sound certificates and sample bounds for estimating IRV ε-winners from samples. Main advances: an explicit K=4 counterexample showing chain-only checks can fail; a correct uniform max-deficit certificate B(c)=max_{S⊇{c}}(min_{a∈S\\{c}} p_a(S)−p_c(S)) (B(c)<ε ⇒ c is an ε-winner, equality needs tie-handling); a two-phase holdout certification with m2 ≥ (2/ε^2)·ln(2M/δ) (M=(K−1)·2^{K−2}+2^{K−1}); and a K=3 positive result under a separation assumption (m ≥ (8/ε^2)·ln(18/δ), γ ≥ ε/2). Lower bound K=2: m = Ω((1/ε^2)·ln(1/δ)); a Fano-type Ω((log K)/ε^2) lower bound is outlined but not yet formalized.
