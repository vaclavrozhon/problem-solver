Overall, the current output establishes a clean and essentially correct certify-or-abstain guarantee for the natural IRV sampler using a uniform concentration argument over the family of top-among-A score differences. The key ingredients (uniform Hoeffding + union bound over U = K(K−1)2^{K−2} functionals, and a single added ranking Q to realize the observed path) are sound. The proof of Theorem 1 is correct under the additive-ballot model and handles adaptivity by uniform concentration. A minor but important clarity fix: once strict positivity of all d_{r,y}(P′) is achieved, tie-breaking becomes irrelevant—this should be stated explicitly.

The counting identity for U is correct; a short combinatorial proof (ordered pairs (y,x) times subsets containing them) streamlines the presentation. The parametric strengthening proposed by both provers (decoupling the empirical slack τ := min d_{r,y}(S) and the uniform deviation η (or γ)) is a worthwhile addition: it yields a data-dependent certified robustness α̂ = (τ − η)_+ and strictly generalizes the 2ε → ε trigger used in Theorem 1.

On lower bounds, the K=3 two-point construction is solid and directly shows Ω((log(1/δ))/ε^2) samples are necessary. Be careful to prove that, under P_+, only w is an ε-winner (and under P_− only o is), uniformly over all added distributions Q with α ≤ ε. This follows because: (i) e remains the unique first-round loser for all α ≤ ε < 1/3, and (ii) the final pairwise margin can only be reduced by at most α in the numerator before renormalization, so flipping a 2ε margin requires α ≥ 2ε. For the information bound, it is cleaner to use Bretagnolle–Huber (or Chernoff) to get m ≥ c log(1/δ)/ε^2 with an explicit c depending on s.

What to add to output.md now: (1) a short remark clarifying tie-breaking irrelevance once strict inequalities hold; (2) a combinatorial proof of the counting identity U; (3) a parametrized certificate theorem with proof; (4) a gap-dependent success theorem; (5) a K=3 corollary with explicit functionals and constants; (6) a K=3 Le Cam-style lower bound with explicit constants. These are all rigorous and build upon the existing content. Avoid making unconditional success claims for the empirical winner without margin assumptions.

Next steps for provers:
- Generalize the data-dependent certificate into a simple certify-or-abstain procedure computing α̂ = (τ − γ)_+ with γ chosen from m, δ, K; prove its correctness (done) and document its practical use.
- Tighten constants via Bernstein/Freedman (variance-sensitive) if desired, and document whether it meaningfully reduces m for moderate K.
- Push on K-dependent lower bounds: construct a packing where a single round’s critical inequality is perturbed among Θ(K) alternatives while others have constant slack; then apply Fano to show m ≥ Ω((log K)/ε^2) or even Ω(K/ε^2) under a prior.
- For K=3, explicitly list the three functionals used and finalize the constants in the Hoeffding/union bound; include both-sided deviation accounting (factor 2) to avoid ambiguity.
- Consider whether mixtures of a few rankings (not just one) could further reduce the certified α; if pursued, be explicit about composition under renormalization to keep proofs airtight.
