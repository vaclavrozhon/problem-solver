Replaced the flawed chain certificate with a correct uniform max-deficit certificate B(c). Gave a concrete K≥4 counterexample showing chain-based checks can fail even with ε=0. Proved a two-phase holdout certification guarantee (with sample complexity via Hoeffding + union bound), and a K=3 theorem under a separation assumption ensuring the sample identifies the correct final opponent. Clarified tie-handling by requiring strict slack. Updated proofs and main results accordingly; general K one-phase analysis remains open.
