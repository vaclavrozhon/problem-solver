Preliminaries. Let C be the K candidates. For nonempty S⊆C and a∈S, let p_a(S)=Pr[top_S(ballot)=a], where top_S(x) is the highest-ranked candidate from S on ballot x. Adding ε fraction of c-first ballots increases p_c(S) by ε for every S⊇{c} and leaves p_a(S) for a≠c unchanged (we compare absolute tallies).

Lemma (Uniform certificate). Fix c∈C and define B(c)=max_{S⊇{c}} (min_{a∈S\{c}} p_a(S) − p_c(S)). If B(c) < ε, then c is an ε-winner. If B(c) ≤ ε and, whenever equality holds after adding ε, the tie-breaking rule does not eliminate c among tied minima, then c is an ε-winner.
Proof. After adding ε of c-first ballots, for any S⊇{c} we have p'_c(S)=p_c(S)+ε ≥ min_{a∈S\{c}} p_a(S) = min_{a∈S\{c}} p'_a(S). If the inequalities are strict, c is never strictly below the round minimum and thus never eliminated; with favorable tie-breaking at equality, the same conclusion holds. Hence c wins IRV eventually. ∎

Proposition (Two-phase holdout certification). Consider the following algorithm: Phase 1 draws m1 ballots and runs IRV to obtain ĉ. Phase 2 draws m2 fresh ballots and, for every S⊇{ĉ} and a∈S, estimates p̃_a(S). Define B̃(ĉ)=max_{S⊇{ĉ}} (min_{a∈S\{ĉ}} p̃_a(S) − p̃_{ĉ}(S)). If m2 ≥ (2/ε^2)·ln(2M/δ), where M = (K−1)·2^{K−2} + 2^{K−1}, then with probability at least 1−δ (over Phase 2), simultaneously |p̃_a(S)−p_a(S)| ≤ ε/4 for all required (S,a). On this event, if B̃(ĉ) ≤ ε/2 − ξ for any ξ>0, then B(ĉ) ≤ ε − ξ and, by the lemma, ĉ is an ε-winner. If instead B̃(ĉ) ≤ ε/2 exactly, then B(ĉ) ≤ ε; to conclude ĉ is an ε-winner one additionally requires that the tie-breaking rule will not eliminate ĉ at equality after adding ε.
Proof. Hoeffding’s inequality with a union bound over the M indicator functions for a≠ĉ plus the 2^{K−1} functions for p_{ĉ}(S) yields the stated uniform deviation. Then for any S⊇{ĉ}, min_{a≠ĉ} p_a(S) − p_{ĉ}(S) ≤ min_{a≠ĉ} p̃_a(S) − p̃_{ĉ}(S) + ε/2. Taking maxima over S gives B(ĉ) ≤ B̃(ĉ)+ε/2. The conclusion follows from the lemma. ∎

Theorem (K=3, natural algorithm under separation). Let C={c,a,b} and suppose |p_a(C)−p_b(C)| ≥ γ. Draw m i.i.d. ballots, run IRV with the fixed tie-breaking rule on the sample, and let ĉ be the sample winner. If m ≥ (8/ε^2)·ln(18/δ) and γ ≥ ε/2, then with probability at least 1−δ, ĉ is an ε-winner.
Proof. For S∈{C,{ĉ,a},{ĉ,b}} and x∈S there are 9 quantities p_x(S). By Hoeffding and a union bound, with probability ≥1−δ, |p̂_x(S)−p_x(S)| ≤ α where α=√(ln(18/δ)/(2m)) ≤ ε/4. Let x* be the more popular of {a,b} at S=C in truth, and x̂ the same in the sample. Since α ≤ γ/2, x̂=x*. In the sample, ĉ is not the minimum at C and ĉ beats x̂ in the final pair; thus p̂_{ĉ}(C) ≥ min_{y∈{a,b}} p̂_y(C) and p̂_{ĉ}({ĉ,x*}) ≥ p̂_{x*}({ĉ,x*}). Transferring to truth: p_{ĉ}(C) ≥ min_{y} p_y(C) − 2α and p_{ĉ}({ĉ,x*}) ≥ p_{x*}({ĉ,x*}) − 2α. Adding ε mass of ĉ-first ballots increases ĉ’s tallies by ε on both sets, yielding margins at least ε−2α ≥ ε/2 > 0. Hence ĉ is not eliminated at C and defeats x* head-to-head, so ĉ wins IRV. ∎

Lower bound (K=2). Any algorithm that outputs an ε-winner with error probability at most δ requires m = Ω((1/ε^2)·log(1/δ)) samples in the worst case.
Proof sketch. Reduce to distinguishing Bernoulli means 1/2±ε/2 on m samples; Le Cam’s method gives the bound since the total variation between the product measures is e^{−Θ(mε^2)}. ∎
