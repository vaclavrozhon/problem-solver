Fix the sample-winner c\u0302 from Phase 1. On an independent holdout of size m2, for each S\u2287{c\u0302} and a\u2208S, define indicators g_{S,a}(ballot)=1[top_S(ballot)=a] and empirical frequencies p\u0303_a(S).\n\nDefine the empirical max-deficit\nB\u0303(c\u0302) := max_{S\u2287{c\u0302}} [ min_{a\u2208S\\{c\u0302}} p\u0303_a(S) \u2212 p\u0303_{c\u0302}(S) ].\n\nLemma A (Uniform deviation size). For fixed c\u0302, the number of distinct functions g_{S,a} needed to evaluate B\u0303(c\u0302) is\nM_c := (K\u22121)\u00b72^{K\u22122}  +  2^{K\u22121} = 2^{K\u22122}(K+1),\nwhere the first term counts all a\u2208S\\{c\u0302} across S\u2287{c\u0302}, and the second term counts p\u0303_{c\u0302}(S) across S\u2287{c\u0302}.\n\nProof. The family of S containing c\u0302 has size 2^{K\u22121}. Summing |S\\{c\u0302}| over these S gives \u2211_{t=1}^{K\u22121} t\u00b7C(K\u22121,t)=(K\u22121)2^{K\u22122}. Adding the 2^{K\u22121} functions for p\u0303_{c\u0302}(S) yields the claim. \u220e\n\nTheorem B (Holdout certificate \u21d2 \u03b5-winner). Fix any \u03be>0. If on the holdout sample the event E holds:\n(i) |p\u0303_a(S) \u2212 p_a(S)| \u2264 \u03b5/4 for all the M_c functions; and\n(ii) B\u0303(c\u0302) \u2264 \u03b5/2 \u2212 \u03be;\nthen B(c\u0302) \u2264 \u03b5 \u2212 \u03be and, after adding \u03b5 fraction of c\u0302-first ballots, c\u0302 wins IRV (i.e., is an \u03b5-winner). In particular, if Hoeffding\u2019s inequality ensures (i) with probability \u22651\u2212\u03b4 via m2 \u2265 (2/\u03b5^2)\u00b7ln(2M_c/\u03b4), then with probability \u22651\u2212\u03b4, whenever (ii) holds the output is correct.\n\nProof. On event (i), for every S\u2287{c\u0302} and a\u2208S we have p_a(S) \u2265 p\u0303_a(S) \u2212 \u03b5/4 and p_{c\u0302}(S) \u2264 p\u0303_{c\u0302}(S) + \u03b5/4, hence\nmin_{a\u2260c\u0302} p_a(S) \u2212 p_{c\u0302}(S) \u2264 [min_{a\u2260c\u0302} p\u0303_a(S) \u2212 p\u0303_{c\u0302}(S)] + \u03b5/2.\nTaking maxima over S gives B(c\u0302) \u2264 B\u0303(c\u0302) + \u03b5/2 \u2264 \u03b5 \u2212 \u03be. By the uniform certificate, adding \u03b5 mass of c\u0302-first ballots makes c\u0302 strictly safe in every S by margin \u2265 \u03be, so ties cannot eliminate c\u0302. \u220e\n\nRemarks.\n- Counting refinement: M_c = 2^{K\u22122}(K+1) strictly improves over naive K\u00b72^{K\u22121}.\n- Strict tie handling is built in via \u03be>0; one can take \u03be arbitrarily small by tightening the empirical threshold.\n\n\n## 2) K=3: exact minimal augmentation and sampling corollary\nLet C={c,a,b}. Define x*\u2208{a,b} by p_{x*}(C)=max{p_a(C),p_b(C)}.\n\nProposition C (Exact c-first augmentation for K=3). The minimal \u03b5 (restricted to adding c-first ballots) that makes c win IRV equals\nE_c := max{ [min{p_a(C),p_b(C)} \u2212 p_c(C)]_+ , [p_{x*}({c,x*}) \u2212 p_c({c,x*})]_+ }.\n\nProof. Adding \u03b5 of c-first ballots increases p_c(S) by \u03b5 for S\u2287{c} and leaves others unchanged. In K=3, IRV eliminates the minimum at C first; the eliminated candidate is y*\u2208{a,b} with p_{y*}(C)=min{p_a(C),p_b(C)} (independent of \u03b5 since others\u2019 tallies do not change). The final opponent is x*. Thus c wins after augmentation iff both: (1) p_c(C)+\u03b5 \u2265 p_{y*}(C), and (2) p_c({c,x*})+\u03b5 \u2265 p_{x*}({c,x*}). The least \u03b5 satisfying both is the stated maximum. Necessity and sufficiency are immediate. \u220e\n\nCorollary D (Separation-based guarantee for the natural algorithm). Suppose |p_a(C)\u2212p_b(C)| \u2265 \u03b3. Draw m ballots, run IRV, and output c\u0302 with final opponent x\u0302 (the larger of {a,b} in the sample). If m \u2265 (8/\u03b5^2)\u00b7ln(18/\u03b4) and \u03b3 \u2265 \u03b5/2, then with probability \u22651\u2212\u03b4 we have simultaneously: x\u0302 = x* and |p\u0302_x(S)\u2212p_x(S)| \u2264 \u03b5/4 for all needed x,S\u2208{ (C,a),(C,b), ( {c\u0302,x*}, c\u0302 ), ( {c\u0302,x*}, x* ) }. Therefore by Proposition C, E_{c\u0302} \u2264 \u03b5 and c\u0302 is an \u03b5-winner.\n\nSketch. Uniform Hoeffding over the 9 pairs (S,a) with S\u2208{C,{a,c},{b,c}} yields \u03b1:=\u221a(ln(18/\u03b4)/(2m)) \u2264 \u03b5/4; separation gives x\u0302=x*. On the sample, c\u0302 survives C and beats x\u0302; transfer to truth incurs \u22642\u03b1 deficit on each condition, absorbed by \u03b5. \u220e\n\n\n## 3) Single-chain failure (K=4) \u2014 explicit check\nTypes and weights: T1: c>a>d>b (0.34), T2: a>d>c>b (0.29), T3: d>c>a>b (0.34), T4: b>a>d>c (0.03).\n- Round 1 (C): tallies: c=0.34, a=0.29, d=0.34, b=0.03 \u21d2 eliminate b.\n- Round 2 (S={a,c,d}): tallies: c=0.34 (T1), a=0.29+0.03=0.32 (T2+T4), d=0.34 (T3) \u21d2 eliminate a.\n- Final pair {c,d}: c=0.34, d=0.66 \u21d2 c loses.\nA chain that checks vs b at C, then vs a at {a,c,d}, then pair {c,a} would \u201ccertify\u201d c even with \u03b5=0; yet c loses. Hence chain-only witnesses are unsound for K\u22654.\n\n\n## 4) Structural caution: non-monotonicity of deficits\nDefine for fixed c the set function f(S)=min_{a\u2208S\\{c}} p_a(S) \u2212 p_c(S). In general, f is not monotone in S: adding a candidate can raise or lower the gap. Small K=4 example (by perturbing the instance above) exhibits S\u2282T with f(S)<0<f(T). Thus, attempts to reduce to only maximal or minimal S are invalid in general.\n\n\n## 5) Why the K=3 case is special\nLet r1,\u2026,r6 denote the six ranking-region masses on {a,b,c}. Then p_c(C)=r1+r2 and p_c({a,b,c})=r1+r2 as well; p_a(C)=r3+r4, p_b(C)=r5+r6. Hence \u201cc below both a,b on {a,b,c}\u201d is equivalent to \u201cc is the minimum at C.\u201d This identity fails once K\u22654 because top-of-C and top-of-S can decouple through other candidates.\n\n\n## 6) Obstacles\n- One-phase natural algorithm for K\u22654: c\u0302 being the sample IRV winner does not ensure B\u0302(c\u0302)\u22640; sets off the sample path can still witness positive empirical deficit.\n- Reducing the family of S: f(S) lacks monotonicity/submodularity, and we currently lack a proof that the maximizer of f lies among \u201cIRV-reachable\u201d sets along the true path.\n- Lower bounds: A full Fano-style \u03a9((log K)/\u03b5^2) construction remains to be instantiated with explicit IRV profiles that feature a unique \u03b5/4-winner and small pairwise KL.\n\n\n## 7) Next steps\n- Move Theorem B (with M_c=2^{K\u22122}(K+1)) to proofs with explicit constants and tie slack \u03be.\n- For K=3, record Proposition C (exact E_c) and its sampling corollary; examine whether the \u03b3 \u2265 \u03b5/2 separation can be weakened by allocating a small extra \u03b5 budget to simultaneously verify both possible finals.\n- Investigate whether, for fixed c, the maximizer of f(S) can be constrained to S encountered by IRV under some \u201cneighboring\u201d profile (even if not the true one), to lower the verification family size.\n- Begin an explicit Fano family: parameterize K instances by swapping \u03b5/\u0398(K) mass among ballots that adjust only two rounds (first-round min and final head-to-head) so that each instance has a unique \u03b5/4-winner; compute pairwise KL=\u0398(\u03b5^2) and check IRV behavior.\n"
