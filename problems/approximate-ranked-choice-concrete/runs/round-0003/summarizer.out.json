  "summary_md": "This round fixed a flawed \u2018\u2018single-chain\u2019\u2019 certificate and developed sound certificates and sample bounds. Key outcomes: an explicit K=4 counterexample shows chain-only checks can fail; a uniform max-deficit certificate B(c)=max_{S\u2287{c}}(min_{a\u2208S\\{c}} p_a(S)\u2212p_c(S)) is correct (B(c)<\u03b5 \u21d2 c is \u03b5-winner; equality needs tie rules); a two-phase holdout algorithm can certify the sample winner c\u0302 using m2 \u2265 (8/\u03b5^2)\u00b7ln(2M_c/\u03b4) fresh samples with M_c=2^{K\u22122}(K+1); exact c-first augmentation formula and a separation-based K=3 guarantee (m \u2265 (8/\u03b5^2)\u00b7ln(18/\u03b4), gap \u2265 \u03b5/2); K=2 lower bound m = \u03a9((1/\u03b5^2)\u00b7ln(1/\u03b4)). Noted non-monotonicity of the deficit function and proposed a VC-dimension approach to avoid enumerating 2^K subsets. (Citations: Research Notes; Current Proofs)",

    "Uniform max-deficit certificate B(c)=max_{S\u2287{c}}(min_{a\u2260c} p_a(S)\u2212p_c(S)) is a correct sufficient condition for \u03b5-winning (strictness or tie rule needed at equality).",
    "Two-phase holdout certification: with M_c=2^{K\u22122}(K+1), m2 \u2265 (8/\u03b5^2)\u00b7ln(2M_c/\u03b4) guarantees uniform deviation; if B\u0303(c\u0302) \u2264 \u03b5/2\u2212\u03be then c\u0302 is an \u03b5-winner w.h.p.",
    "Corrected Hoeffding constant (8/\u03b5^2) for uniform holdout; earlier 2/\u03b5^2 was off by factor 4.",
