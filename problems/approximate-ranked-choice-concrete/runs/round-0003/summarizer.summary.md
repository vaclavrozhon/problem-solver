This round fixed a flawed ‘‘single-chain’’ certificate and developed sound certificates and sample bounds. Key outcomes: an explicit K=4 counterexample shows chain-only checks can fail; a uniform max-deficit certificate B(c)=max_{S⊇{c}}(min_{a∈S\{c}} p_a(S)−p_c(S)) is correct (B(c)<ε ⇒ c is ε-winner; equality needs tie rules); a two-phase holdout algorithm can certify the sample winner ĉ using m2 ≥ (8/ε^2)·ln(2M_c/δ) fresh samples with M_c=2^{K−2}(K+1); exact c-first augmentation formula and a separation-based K=3 guarantee (m ≥ (8/ε^2)·ln(18/δ), gap ≥ ε/2); K=2 lower bound m = Ω((1/ε^2)·ln(1/δ)). Noted non-monotonicity of the deficit function and proposed a VC-dimension approach to avoid enumerating 2^K subsets. (Citations: Research Notes; Current Proofs)
