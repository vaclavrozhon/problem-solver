  "feedback_md": "Substantial improvements this round. The uniform max-deficit certificate B(c) is sound (with strict slack), and the K\u22654 counterexample crisply invalidates single-chain witnesses. Your exact K=3 augmentation formula is correct and helpful for sampling corollaries. The tightened function counting M_c=2^{K\u22122}(K+1) for the holdout phase is also right.\n\nKey correction: the Hoeffding/uniform-deviation constant in the holdout theorem is off by a factor 4. To guarantee |p\u0303\u2212p|\u2264\u03b5/4 uniformly over M_c functions, Hoeffding gives P(\u22ef)\u22642M_c\u00b7exp(\u22122m2(\u03b5/4)^2), so we need m2 \u2265 (8/\u03b5^2)\u00b7ln(2M_c/\u03b4), not (2/\u03b5^2)\u00b7ln(\u22ef). This also propagates to any place you quoted (2/\u03b5^2). Please fix both proofs and the main results summary.\n\nTie-handling: you correctly incorporate strict slack \u03be>0 in the acceptance criterion B\u0303(c\u0302)\u2264\u03b5/2\u2212\u03be so that, after adding \u03b5 c\u0302-first ballots, all relevant inequalities are strict and ties cannot eliminate c\u0302. Keep this explicit everywhere. In the K=3 corollary, your \u03b1\u2264\u03b5/4 ensures strict margins \u2265\u03b5/2, so no tie assumptions are needed.\n\nStructural notes are valuable: non-monotonicity of f(S) invalidates pruning by subset/superset argument; the K=3 special structure justifies why the analysis is much simpler there.\n\nMain remaining issues: (i) the holdout certification is exponential in K due to enumerating S; (ii) the one-phase natural algorithm for K\u22654 remains unproven. A promising path is to bound the statistical complexity of the function class G={1[top_S(\u00b7)=a]: S\u2287{a}, a\u2208C}. Each g_{S,a} is a monotone conjunction of pairwise comparisons on permutations; analyzing the VC/pseudodimension of G (likely O(K log K)) could yield O((K log K + log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2) sample bounds without enumerating all S. Separately, pursue the Fano \u03a9((log K)/\u03b5^2) lower bound with an explicit IRV-compatible family.\n\nAction items: fix the holdout constants in proofs/output; add the K=3 exact formula to proofs; keep the counterexample and non-monotonicity observations in notes; investigate VC-dimension/Rademacher bounds for G to reduce exponential dependence; complete the Fano construction.",

The earlier (2/\u03b5^2) factor was incorrect by 4\u00d7.\n\n- Non-monotonicity: For fixed c, f(S)=min_{a\u2208S\\{c}} p_a(S)\u2212p_c(S) need not be monotone in S; there exist S\u2282T with f(S)<0<f(T). So pruning by subset/superset relations is invalid.\n\n- Why K=3 is special: With candidates {a,b,c}, the first-round minimum at C coincides with c being below both opponents at C; and the final opponent is the larger of {a,b} at C, independent of c-first augmentation. This equivalence breaks for K\u22654, where top-of-C and top-of-S can decouple.\n\n- Exact K=3 augmentation (c-first): E_c = max{ [min{p_a(C),p_b(C)} \u2212 p_c(C)]_+ , [p_{x*}({c,x*}) \u2212 p_c({c,x*})]_+ }, x*=argmax_{a,b} p_a(C).\n\n- Toward polynomial sample complexity: Rather than enumerating all S, analyze the statistical complexity of G={1[top_S(\u00b7)=a] : S\u2287{a}, a\u2208C}. Each g_{S,a} is a monotone conjunction of pairwise comparisons on permutations. Bounding VC/pseudodimension of G (conjecturally O(K log K)) could yield O((K log K + log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2) uniform deviation without the 2^K factor. This could enable a one-phase analysis or a more efficient holdout.\n\n- Open tasks: (i) Prove VC/pseudo-dim bounds for G and translate to uniform deviations for B\u0303. (ii) Formalize an explicit Fano \u03a9((log K)/\u03b5^2) lower bound. (iii) Explore whether worst-case S for f(S) are constrained to IRV-reachable sets under neighboring profiles to shrink the verification family.\n"

    "content": "Preliminaries. Let C be the K candidates. For nonempty S\u2286C and a\u2208S, let p_a(S)=Pr[top_S(ballot)=a], where top_S(x) is the highest-ranked candidate from S on ballot x. Adding \u03b5 fraction of c-first ballots increases p_c(S) by \u03b5 for every S\u2287{c} and leaves p_a(S) for a\u2260c unchanged (we compare absolute tallies).\n\nLemma (Uniform certificate). Fix c\u2208C and define B(c)=max_{S\u2287{c}} (min_{a\u2208S\\{c}} p_a(S) \u2212 p_c(S)). If B(c) < \u03b5, then c is an \u03b5-winner. If B(c) \u2264 \u03b5 and, whenever equality holds after adding \u03b5, the tie-breaking rule does not eliminate c among tied minima, then c is an \u03b5-winner.\nProof. After adding \u03b5 of c-first ballots, for any S\u2287{c} we have p'_c(S)=p_c(S)+\u03b5 \u2265 min_{a\u2208S\\{c}} p_a(S) = min_{a\u2208S\\{c}} p'_a(S). With strict inequalities (or favorable tie-breaking at equality), c is never eliminated and thus eventually wins IRV. \u220e\n\nLemma A (Function counting for holdout). Fix c\u0302. The number of distinct indicators g_{S,a}(x)=1[top_S(x)=a] required to evaluate B\u0303(c\u0302) over all S\u2287{c\u0302} and a\u2208S equals\nM_c = (K\u22121)\u00b72^{K\u22122} + 2^{K\u22121} = 2^{K\u22122}(K+1).\nProof. The family of S containing c\u0302 has size 2^{K\u22121}. Summing |S\\{c\u0302}| over these S gives \u2211_{t=1}^{K\u22121} t\u00b7C(K\u22121,t)=(K\u22121)2^{K\u22122}. Adding the 2^{K\u22121} functions for a=c\u0302 yields the claim. \u220e\n\nTheorem B (Holdout certificate \u21d2 \u03b5-winner, with strict slack). Fix \u03be>0. Phase 1: draw m1 ballots, run IRV, and obtain c\u0302. Phase 2: draw m2 fresh ballots and compute\nB\u0303(c\u0302) := max_{S\u2287{c\u0302}} [ min_{a\u2208S\\{c\u0302}} p\u0303_a(S) \u2212 p\u0303_{c\u0302}(S) ],\nwhere p\u0303 are empirical frequencies on the holdout. If\nm2 \u2265 (8/\u03b5^2) \u00b7 ln(2M_c/\u03b4),  with M_c=2^{K\u22122}(K+1),\nthen with probability at least 1\u2212\u03b4, simultaneously |p\u0303_a(S)\u2212p_a(S)| \u2264 \u03b5/4 for all required (S,a). On this event, if B\u0303(c\u0302) \u2264 \u03b5/2 \u2212 \u03be, then B(c\u0302) \u2264 \u03b5 \u2212 \u03be and, by the uniform certificate, adding \u03b5 of c\u0302-first ballots makes c\u0302 strictly safe in every S\u2287{c\u0302} by margin \u2265\u03be; thus c\u0302 wins IRV.\nProof. Hoeffding\u2019s inequality and a union bound over M_c indicators yield the stated uniform deviation with the given m2. For any S, min_{a\u2260c\u0302} p_a(S) \u2212 p_{c\u0302}(S) \u2264 [min_{a\u2260c\u0302} p\u0303_a(S) \u2212 p\u0303_{c\u0302}(S)] + \u03b5/2, hence B(c\u0302) \u2264 B\u0303(c\u0302)+\u03b5/2. The strict slack gives the tie-free conclusion. \u220e\n\nProposition C (K=3: exact c-first augmentation). Let C={c,a,b}. Define x*\u2208{a,b} by p_{x*}(C)=max{p_a(C),p_b(C)}. The minimal \u03b5 (restricted to adding c-first ballots) that makes c win IRV equals\nE_c := max{ [min{p_a(C),p_b(C)} \u2212 p_c(C)]_+ , [p_{x*}({c,x*}) \u2212 p_c({c,x*})]_+ }.\nProof. Adding \u03b5 of c-first ballots increases p_c(S) by \u03b5 for S\u2287{c} and leaves others unchanged. In round 1, c survives iff p_c(C)+\u03b5 \u2265 min{p_a(C),p_b(C)}; then the eliminated candidate is the smaller of {a,b}, and the final opponent is x*. In the final pair {c,x*}, c wins iff p_c({c,x*})+\u03b5 \u2265 p_{x*}({c,x*}). The minimal \u03b5 satisfying both is the stated maximum. \u220e\n\nCorollary D (K=3, separation-based guarantee for the natural algorithm). Let C={c,a,b} and suppose |p_a(C)\u2212p_b(C)| \u2265 \u03b3. Draw m i.i.d. ballots, run IRV with the fixed tie-breaking rule on the sample, and let c\u0302 be the sample winner with sampled final opponent x\u0302. If m \u2265 (8/\u03b5^2)\u00b7ln(18/\u03b4) and \u03b3 \u2265 \u03b5/2, then with probability at least 1\u2212\u03b4 we have x\u0302=x* and |p\u0302_x(S)\u2212p_x(S)| \u2264 \u03b5/4 for all S\u2208{C,{c\u0302,x*}} and x\u2208S. Consequently, by Proposition C, E_{c\u0302} \u2264 \u03b5 and c\u0302 is an \u03b5-winner.\nProof. Uniform Hoeffding over the 9 pairs (S,a) with S\u2208{C,{a,c\u0302},{b,c\u0302}} yields \u03b1=\u221a(ln(18/\u03b4)/(2m)) \u2264 \u03b5/4; the separation ensures x\u0302=x*. In the sample, c\u0302 is not the minimum at C and c\u0302 beats x\u0302; transferring to truth loses at most 2\u03b1 in each inequality. Adding \u03b5 boosts c\u0302\u2019s margins to at least \u03b5\u22122\u03b1 \u2265 \u03b5/2, ensuring a strict win. \u220e\n\nLower bound (K=2). Any algorithm that outputs an \u03b5-winner with error probability at most \u03b4 requires m = \u03a9((1/\u03b5^2)\u00b7log(1/\u03b4)) samples in the worst case.\nProof sketch. Reduce to distinguishing Bernoulli means 1/2\u00b1\u03b5/2 on m samples; Le Cam\u2019s method gives the bound since TV between the product measures is e^{\u2212\u0398(m\u03b5^2)}. \u220e\n"
