The tightened function counting M_c=2^{K−2}(K+1) for the holdout phase is also right.\n\nKey correction: the Hoeffding/uniform-deviation constant in the holdout theorem is off by a factor 4. To guarantee |p̃−p|≤ε/4 uniformly over M_c functions, Hoeffding gives P(⋯)≤2M_c·exp(−2m2(ε/4)^2), so we need m2 ≥ (8/ε^2)·ln(2M_c/δ), not (2/ε^2)·ln(⋯). This also propagates to any place you quoted (2/ε^2). Please fix both proofs and the main results summary.\n\nTie-handling: you correctly incorporate strict slack ξ>0 in the acceptance criterion B̃(ĉ)≤ε/2−ξ so that, after adding ε ĉ-first ballots, all relevant inequalities are strict and ties cannot eliminate ĉ. Keep this explicit everywhere. In the K=3 corollary, your α≤ε/4 ensures strict margins ≥ε/2, so no tie assumptions are needed.\n\nStructural notes are valuable: non-monotonicity of f(S) invalidates pruning by subset/superset argument; the K=3 special structure justifies why the analysis is much simpler there.\n\nMain remaining issues: (i) the holdout certification is exponential in K due to enumerating S; (ii) the one-phase natural algorithm for K≥4 remains unproven.

The earlier (2/ε^2) factor was incorrect by 4×.\n\n- Non-monotonicity: For fixed c, f(S)=min_{a∈S\\{c}} p_a(S)−p_c(S) need not be monotone in S; there exist S⊂T with f(S)<0<f(T). So pruning by subset/superset relations is invalid.\n\n- Why K=3 is special: With candidates {a,b,c}, the first-round minimum at C coincides with c being below both opponents at C; and the final opponent is the larger of {a,b} at C, independent of c-first augmentation. This equivalence breaks for K≥4, where top-of-C and top-of-S can decouple.\n\n- Exact K=3 augmentation (c-first): E_c = max{ [min{p_a(C),p_b(C)} − p_c(C)]_+ , [p_{x*}({c,x*}) − p_c({c,x*})]_+ }, x*=argmax_{a,b} p_a(C).\n\n- Toward polynomial sample complexity: Rather than enumerating all S, analyze the statistical complexity of G={1[top_S(·)=a] : S⊇{a}, a∈C}. Each g_{S,a} is a monotone conjunction of pairwise comparisons on permutations. Bounding VC/pseudodimension of G (conjecturally O(K log K)) could yield O((K log K + log(1/δ))/ε^2) uniform deviation without the 2^K factor. This could enable a one-phase analysis or a more efficient holdout.\n\n- Open tasks: (i) Prove VC/pseudo-dim bounds for G and translate to uniform deviations for B̃. (ii) Formalize an explicit Fano Ω((log K)/ε^2) lower bound. (iii) Explore whether worst-case S for f(S) are constrained to IRV-reachable sets under neighboring profiles to shrink the verification family.\n"},"proofs_update":{"action":"replace","content":"Preliminaries. Let C be the K candidates. For nonempty S⊆C and a∈S, let p_a(S)=Pr[top_S(ballot)=a], where top_S(x) is the highest-ranked candidate from S on ballot x. Adding ε fraction of c-first ballots increases p_c(S) by ε for every S⊇{c} and leaves p_a(S) for a≠c unchanged (we compare absolute tallies).\n\nLemma (Uniform certificate). Fix c∈C and define B(c)=max_{S⊇{c}} (min_{a∈S\\{c}} p_a(S) − p_c(S)). If B(c) < ε, then c is an ε-winner. If B(c) ≤ ε and, whenever equality holds after adding ε, the tie-breaking rule does not eliminate c among tied minima, then c is an ε-winner.\nProof. After adding ε of c-first ballots, for any S⊇{c} we have p'_c(S)=p_c(S)+ε ≥ min_{a∈S\\{c}} p_a(S) = min_{a∈S\\{c}} p'_a(S). With strict inequalities (or favorable tie-breaking at equality), c is never eliminated and thus eventually wins IRV. ∎\n\nLemma A (Function counting for holdout). Fix ĉ. The number of distinct indicators g_{S,a}(x)=1[top_S(x)=a] required to evaluate B̃(ĉ) over all S⊇{ĉ} and a∈S equals\nM_c = (K−1)·2^{K−2} + 2^{K−1} = 2^{K−2}(K+1).\nProof. The family of S containing ĉ has size 2^{K−1}. Summing |S\\{ĉ}| over these S gives ∑_{t=1}^{K−1} t·C(K−1,t)=(K−1)2^{K−2}. Adding the 2^{K−1} functions for a=ĉ yields the claim. ∎\n\nTheorem B (Holdout certificate ⇒ ε-winner, with strict slack). Fix ξ>0. Phase 1: draw m1 ballots, run IRV, and obtain ĉ. Phase 2: draw m2 fresh ballots and compute\nB̃(ĉ) := max_{S⊇{ĉ}} [ min_{a∈S\\{ĉ}} p̃_a(S) − p̃_{ĉ}(S) ],\nwhere p̃ are empirical frequencies on the holdout. If\nm2 ≥ (8/ε^2) · ln(2M_c/δ),  with M_c=2^{K−2}(K+1),\nthen with probability at least 1−δ, simultaneously |p̃_a(S)−p_a(S)| ≤ ε/4 for all required (S,a). On this event, if B̃(ĉ) ≤ ε/2 − ξ, then B(ĉ) ≤ ε − ξ and, by the uniform certificate, adding ε of ĉ-first ballots makes ĉ strictly safe in every S⊇{ĉ} by margin ≥ξ; thus ĉ wins IRV.\nProof. Hoeffding’s inequality and a union bound over M_c indicators yield the stated uniform deviation with the given m2. For any S, min_{a≠ĉ} p_a(S) − p_{ĉ}(S) ≤ [min_{a≠ĉ} p̃_a(S) − p̃_{ĉ}(S)] + ε/2, hence B(ĉ) ≤ B̃(ĉ)+ε/2. The strict slack gives the tie-free conclusion. ∎\n\nProposition C (K=3: exact c-first augmentation). Let C={c,a,b}. Define x*∈{a,b} by p_{x*}(C)=max{p_a(C),p_b(C)}. The minimal ε (restricted to adding c-first ballots) that makes c win IRV equals\nE_c := max{ [min{p_a(C),p_b(C)} − p_c(C)]_+ , [p_{x*}({c,x*}) − p_c({c,x*})]_+ }.\nProof. Adding ε of c-first ballots increases p_c(S) by ε for S⊇{c} and leaves others unchanged. In round 1, c survives iff p_c(C)+ε ≥ min{p_a(C),p_b(C)}; then the eliminated candidate is the smaller of {a,b}, and the final opponent is x*. In the final pair {c,x*}, c wins iff p_c({c,x*})+ε ≥ p_{x*}({c,x*}). The minimal ε satisfying both is the stated maximum. ∎\n\nCorollary D (K=3, separation-based guarantee for the natural algorithm). Let C={c,a,b} and suppose |p_a(C)−p_b(C)| ≥ γ. Draw m i.i.d. ballots, run IRV with the fixed tie-breaking rule on the sample, and let ĉ be the sample winner with sampled final opponent x̂. If m ≥ (8/ε^2)·ln(18/δ) and γ ≥ ε/2, then with probability at least 1−δ we have x̂=x* and |p̂_x(S)−p_x(S)| ≤ ε/4 for all S∈{C,{ĉ,x*}} and x∈S. Consequently, by Proposition C, E_{ĉ} ≤ ε and ĉ is an ε-winner.\nProof. Uniform Hoeffding over the 9 pairs (S,a) with S∈{C,{a,ĉ},{b,ĉ}} yields α=√(ln(18/δ)/(2m)) ≤ ε/4; the separation ensures x̂=x*. In the sample, ĉ is not the minimum at C and ĉ beats x̂; transferring to truth loses at most 2α in each inequality. Adding ε boosts ĉ’s margins to at least ε−2α ≥ ε/2, ensuring a strict win. ∎\n\nLower bound (K=2). Any algorithm that outputs an ε-winner with error probability at most δ requires m = Ω((1/ε^2)·log(1/δ)) samples in the worst case.\nProof sketch. Reduce to distinguishing Bernoulli means 1/2±ε/2 on m samples; Le Cam’s method gives the bound since TV between the product measures is e^{−Θ(mε^2)}. ∎\n"},"output_update":{"action":"replace","content":"Main results to date:\n\n- Two-phase holdout certification (general K).
