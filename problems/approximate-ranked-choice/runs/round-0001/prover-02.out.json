  "progress_md": "Ideas\n- Define, for a distribution P over full rankings and a candidate c, the tallies after eliminating a set S \u2286 C \\ {c} as T_x(S) = P[the top-ranked among C \\ S is x]. These are linear functionals of P.\n- If we add an \u03b1-fraction of ballots all ranking c first, then T_c(S) increases by \u03b1 for all S, while T_j(S) for j \u2260 c are unchanged. Hence the minimal \u03b1 that guarantees c is never last at any elimination stage is\n  f_c(P) := max_{S \u2286 C\\{c}} ( min_{j \u2209 S \u222a {c}} T_j(S) \u2212 T_c(S) )_+.\n  Why useful: If f_c(P) \u2264 \u03b5 then c is an \u03b5-winner (sufficient certificate); conversely, any addition strategy cannot do better for the \u201cnever-last\u201d condition by allocating mass away from c-first ballots, since that weakly increases min_{j\u2260c} T_j(S).\n- Necessary condition via pairwise margins: For any j \u2260 c, considering S = C \\ {c, j} (so R = {c, j}) gives T_j(S) \u2212 T_c(S) = P[j \u227b c] \u2212 P[c \u227b j]. Therefore f_c(P) \u2265 max_j (P[j \u227b c] \u2212 P[c \u227b j])_+.\n\nSpecial case K = 3 (exact formula)\n- Let candidates be {a, b, c}. Then the only relevant S for c are \u2205, {a}, {b}. Thus\n  f_c(P) = max{ (min{T_a(\u2205), T_b(\u2205)} \u2212 T_c(\u2205))_+, (P[a \u227b c] \u2212 P[c \u227b a])_+, (P[b \u227b c] \u2212 P[c \u227b b])_+ }.\n  Here T_x(\u2205) are first-place shares. Proof sketch: T_x({y}) with x \u2208 {b, c} equals head-to-head shares between x and the remaining opponent, because R = {x, c} or {x, b}; for S = \u2205 we compare first-round tallies. There are no other S.\n- Usefulness: For K = 3, identifying an \u03b5-winner reduces to estimating three quantities (two pairwise margins w.r.t. c and the first-place deficit against the smaller of {a, b}).\n\nSample-complexity implications\n- Upper bound for K = 3: With m = O((log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2) samples, we can estimate first-place shares and pairwise margins within \u00b1\u03b5/4 (Hoeffding + union bound over a constant number of events). If min_c f\u0302_c \u2264 \u03b5/2, then with probability \u2265 1 \u2212 \u03b4, the true f_c \u2264 \u03b5 and the returned c is an \u03b5-winner.\n- General K (existence, exponential in K): Estimating all T_x(S) uniformly within \u00b1\u03c4 over all pairs (S, x \u2209 S) requires m = O(((K 2^{K}) + log(1/\u03b4))/\u03c4^2) samples by a union bound. Then computing f\u0302_c exactly from these estimates yields a correct certificate whenever min_c f\u0302_c \u2264 \u03b5 \u2212 2\u03c4.\n- General lower bound: Even with K = 2, the problem subsumes estimating a Bernoulli mean within \u03b5 to decide if a candidate is an \u03b5-winner, implying m = \u03a9((1/\u03b5^2) log(1/\u03b4)). Therefore the dependence on \u03b5 and \u03b4 is necessary.\n- K-dependence lower bound (sketch): Distinguishing among \u2248 K hypotheses where exactly one candidate is an \u03b5-winner (constructed by small perturbations of P concentrating probability mass among disjoint top patterns) suggests m = \u03a9((log K)/\u03b5^2) via Fano\u2019s inequality. Details to be worked out.\n\nExamples\n- K = 3 toy distribution: Suppose first-place shares are (a, b, c) = (0.36, 0.34, 0.30), and pairwise margins are P[a \u227b c] \u2212 P[c \u227b a] = 0.07, P[b \u227b c] \u2212 P[c \u227b b] = 0.01. Then f_c(P) = max{0.04, 0.07, 0.01} = 0.07; c is an \u03b5-winner iff \u03b5 \u2265 0.07.\n- K = 4 phenomenon: One can construct P where f_c(P) is driven by a 3-way residual set R of size 3 (not captured by first-place or pairwise deficits). E.g., c has small first-place share and loses many \u201ctop among {c, j, k}\u201d contests due to a strong third candidate siphoning top positions when both j and k remain. This indicates that for K \u2265 4, relying only on pairwise margins and first-round shares is insufficient for certification.\n\nObstacles\n- Exact computation/certification of f_c(P) for general K requires knowing T_x(S) for exponentially many S. This leads to exponential dependence on K in na\u00efve sampling algorithms.\n- Deriving tight necessary and sufficient conditions in terms of only polynomially many statistics (e.g., pairwise margins, a bounded collection of multiway-top events) remains open.\n\nNext steps\n- Prove rigorously the K = 3 formula above (write out the short formal proof) and add it to output.md.\n- Seek structural reductions for K \u2265 4: is sup over S attained at sets where |C \\ S| \u2264 3? If yes, certification reduces to O(K^3) multiway-top probabilities; otherwise produce a counterexample.\n- Develop a polynomial-time, polynomial-sample upper bound by proposing a relax-and-certify scheme: consider only all R of size \u2264 r (e.g., r = 3 or 4), compute f_c^r = max over such R of (min_{j\u2208R\\{c}} T_j(R) \u2212 T_c(R))_+. If f_c^r \u2264 \u03b5 we certify; analyze how conservative this is and whether, under mild distributional assumptions (e.g., smoothness of rank distributions), r = 3 suffices.\n- Strengthen lower bounds in K via explicit Fano constructions tying \u03b5-winner identity to a log K-bit index encoded in small perturbations of top-of-R events.\n\nGaps in output.md\n- There is currently no output. We can add the precise K = 3 characterization and the general sufficient certificate f_c(P) \u2264 \u03b5 with associated sample-complexity bounds, plus the \u03a9((1/\u03b5^2) log(1/\u03b4)) lower bound."
