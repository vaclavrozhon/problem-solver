  "summary_md": "This round compared two parallel approaches for certifying that candidate c can be made an IRV winner by adding \u2264\u03b5 mass: (i) a simple, conservative \"c\u2011first\" certificate M_c / f_c based on top-within-S tallies (sufficient only), and (ii) an LP that, for a fixed elimination order, exactly characterizes the minimal added mass. Both provers proved uniform convergence for the top-within-S indicators (union bound over \u2264K\u00b72^{K-1} functions) giving a plug-in estimator with additive error control (\u22642\u03c4). Sample complexity for the certifier is sound but exponential in K (\u2248O(K\u00b72^{K-1}/\u03b5^2)). The verifier corrected key issues: the deficit must compare c to other candidates in S (typo), tie-breaking requires strict inequalities or explicit encoding in the LP, and the claimed K=3 exactness (for arbitrary added ballots) is not generally true. Solid lower bound: \u03a9((log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2) via K=2 holds; K-dependent lower bounds remain conjectural. (Sources: prover-01, prover-02, verifier-feedback.)",
  "highlights": [
    "Defined top-within-S tallies t_a(S) and showed they are linear functionals of the population distribution.",
    "Conservative c-first certificate M_c/f_c is a valid sufficient condition; plug-in estimator error \u2264 2\u03c4, so certifier needs m = O((log(K\u00b72^{K-1})+log(1/\u03b4))/\u03c4^2) samples (\u03c4\u2248\u03b5/4) \u2014 exponential-in-K sample complexity.",
    "LP for a fixed elimination order exactly captures minimal added mass, reducing IRV dynamics to linear constraints over added-ballot measures.",
    "Verifier fixes: deficit must be min over other candidates in S (typo), and tie-breaking requires strictness or explicit encoding in LP constraints.",
    "K=3 exactness claim via c-first ballots is disputed; allowing non\u2013c-first additions can strictly improve the optimum in some cases. K\u22654 needs multiway-top events and may require exponentially many S."

  "next_questions": [
    "Derive a rigorous LP sensitivity (stability) bound for the fixed-order LP optima under perturbations of {t_a(S)} (aim for an explicit O(K) constant) while handling tie-breaking precisely.",
    "Characterize the true minimal augmentation for K=3 allowing arbitrary added ballots (not just c-first) and produce a provable formula/case analysis.",
    "Construct and prove K-dependent lower bounds (e.g., \u03a9(K/\u03b5^2) or \u03a9((log K)/\u03b5^2)) via explicit packing/Fano constructions or provide counterexamples showing such bounds fail."
