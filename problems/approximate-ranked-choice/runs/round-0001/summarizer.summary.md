This round compared two parallel approaches for certifying that candidate c can be made an IRV winner by adding ≤ε mass: (i) a simple, conservative "c‑first" certificate M_c / f_c based on top-within-S tallies (sufficient only), and (ii) an LP that, for a fixed elimination order, exactly characterizes the minimal added mass. Both provers proved uniform convergence for the top-within-S indicators (union bound over ≤K·2^{K-1} functions) giving a plug-in estimator with additive error control (≤2τ). Sample complexity for the certifier is sound but exponential in K (≈O(K·2^{K-1}/ε^2)). The verifier corrected key issues: the deficit must compare c to other candidates in S (typo), tie-breaking requires strict inequalities or explicit encoding in the LP, and the claimed K=3 exactness (for arbitrary added ballots) is not generally true. Solid lower bound: Ω((log(1/δ))/ε^2) via K=2 holds; K-dependent lower bounds remain conjectural. (Sources: prover-01, prover-02, verifier-feedback.)
