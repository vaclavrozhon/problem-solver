  "summary_md": "This round compared two parallel approaches for certifying that candidate c can be made an IRV winner by adding ≤ε mass: (i) a simple, conservative \"c‑first\" certificate M_c / f_c based on top-within-S tallies (sufficient only), and (ii) an LP that, for a fixed elimination order, exactly characterizes the minimal added mass. Both provers proved uniform convergence for the top-within-S indicators (union bound over ≤K·2^{K-1} functions) giving a plug-in estimator with additive error control (≤2τ). Sample complexity for the certifier is sound but exponential in K (≈O(K·2^{K-1}/ε^2)). The verifier corrected key issues: the deficit must compare c to other candidates in S (typo), tie-breaking requires strict inequalities or explicit encoding in the LP, and the claimed K=3 exactness (for arbitrary added ballots) is not generally true. Solid lower bound: Ω((log(1/δ))/ε^2) via K=2 holds; K-dependent lower bounds remain conjectural. (Sources: prover-01, prover-02, verifier-feedback.)",
  "highlights": [
    "Defined top-within-S tallies t_a(S) and showed they are linear functionals of the population distribution.",
    "Conservative c-first certificate M_c/f_c is a valid sufficient condition; plug-in estimator error ≤ 2τ, so certifier needs m = O((log(K·2^{K-1})+log(1/δ))/τ^2) samples (τ≈ε/4) — exponential-in-K sample complexity.",
    "LP for a fixed elimination order exactly captures minimal added mass, reducing IRV dynamics to linear constraints over added-ballot measures.",
    "Verifier fixes: deficit must be min over other candidates in S (typo), and tie-breaking requires strictness or explicit encoding in LP constraints.",
    "K=3 exactness claim via c-first ballots is disputed; allowing non–c-first additions can strictly improve the optimum in some cases. K≥4 needs multiway-top events and may require exponentially many S."
