  "progress_md": "## Gaps in output.md\n- The LP approach is stated but lacks a precise, sample-to-decision bound (no explicit Lipschitz/sensitivity constant). This blocks turning it into a polynomial-sample certifier.\n- For K = 3, an exact minimal-augmentation formula allowing mixed added ballots is missing; only a counterexample to c-first exactness is given.\n\n## Ideas\n- Give an explicit LP for a fixed elimination order \u03c0, derive its dual, and prove a coarse but explicit Lipschitz bound O(K^2) for the optimal value with respect to uniform perturbations of the RHS tallies b = {t_a(S_j)}. This yields a polynomial-in-K sample bound for any fixed \u03c0.\n- For K = 3 and target winner c, derive a closed-form expression for the exact minimal added mass under each of the two feasible \u201cfirst elimination\u201d strategies (eliminate a first vs eliminate b first), then take the minimum. This uses only t_a({a,b,c}) and pairwise t_c({c,a}), t_c({c,b}).\n\n## Results (checkable lemmas/propositions)\n\nLemma 1 (LP for a fixed elimination order and its dual).\nFix \u03c0 \u2208 Perm(C), and let S_j = {\u03c0(j),\u2026,\u03c0(K)}. Introduce variables y(r) \u2265 0 for each full ranking r, and set total mass ||y||_1 = \u2211_r y(r). For each j \u2208 {1,\u2026,K\u22121} and a \u2208 S_j \\ {\u03c0(j)}, define the constraint\n\u2211_r y(r) [1[top_{S_j}(r)=a] \u2212 1[top_{S_j}(r)=\u03c0(j)]] \u2265 t_{\u03c0(j)}(S_j) \u2212 t_a(S_j).\nMinimize ||y||_1 subject to all constraints and y \u2265 0. Denote the optimal value by v_\u03c0(t).\nIts dual is\nmaximize \u2211_{j} \u2211_{a\u2260\u03c0(j)} \u03bb_{j,a} [t_{\u03c0(j)}(S_j) \u2212 t_a(S_j)]\nsubject to for all rankings r: \u2211_{j} (\u03bb_{j, top_{S_j}(r)} \u2212 \u03bb_{j,\u03c0(j)} 1[top_{S_j}(r)=\u03c0(j)]) \u2264 1, and \u03bb \u2265 0.\nWhy useful: v_\u03c0(t) gives the exact minimal augmentation to realize \u03c0, and the dual yields sensitivity bounds.\n\nLemma 2 (Coarse sensitivity bound for fixed \u03c0).\nLet M = \u2211_{j=1}^{K\u22121} (|S_j|\u22121) = K(K\u22121)/2 be the number of constraints. If the RHS vector b = {t_{\u03c0(j)}(S_j) \u2212 t_a(S_j)} is perturbed by at most \u03c4 in sup norm, then v_\u03c0 changes by at most M \u03c4: for all b,b\u2032 with ||b\u2212b\u2032||_\u221e \u2264 \u03c4,\n|v_\u03c0(b) \u2212 v_\u03c0(b\u2032)| \u2264 M \u03c4.\nProof sketch: Given a primal feasible y for b, to satisfy b\u2032 \u2265 b coordinate-wise by \u2264 \u03c4, add for each constraint (j,a) an extra \u03c4 mass on any ranking r with top_{S_j}(r)=a and top_{S_j}(r)\u2260\u03c0(j). This increases that constraint\u2019s LHS by \u03c4 without decreasing any other; summing over all M constraints adds total mass M \u03c4 and yields feasibility for b\u2032. Symmetrically for b \u2265 b\u2032. Thus the optimal value is M-Lipschitz in ||\u00b7||_\u221e.\nWhy useful: Converts uniform estimation error \u03c4 of the involved tallies into \u2264 M \u03c4 error in the LP optimum; gives a polynomial-in-K sample bound for certifying a fixed \u03c0.\n\nProposition 3 (Exact minimal augmentation for K = 3 via two strategies).\nLet C = {a,b,c} and target winner c. Define first-round deficits against a:\nD_b := [t_a({a,b,c}) \u2212 t_b({a,b,c})]_+, D_c := [t_a({a,b,c}) \u2212 t_c({a,b,c})]_+.\nDefine pairwise deficit of c vs b: m_{cb} := [t_b({c,b}) \u2212 t_c({c,b})]_+ (similarly m_{ca} for c vs a).\nThen the exact minimal added mass needed to make c win under IRV equals\nmin{ \u03c6_a, \u03c6_b }, where\n\u03c6_a = max{ D_b + D_c, m_{cb} + 2 D_b },\n\u03c6_b = max{ D_a\u2032 + D_c\u2032, m_{ca} + 2 D_a\u2032 },\nwith D_a\u2032 := [t_b({a,b,c}) \u2212 t_a({a,b,c})]_+, D_c\u2032 := [t_b({a,b,c}) \u2212 t_c({a,b,c})]_+.\nProof sketch: Consider strategy \u201celiminate a first.\u201d In the first round, using only b-first and c-first additions (a-first is never optimal since it raises the opposing side of the inequalities), the constraints are y_b \u2265 D_b and y_c \u2265 D_c, where y_x is the mass of x-first added ballots (these fully characterize top_{S} increments for S={a,b,c}). In the final between c and b, any b-first ballot ranks b over c, and any c-first ballot ranks c over b, hence the net pairwise margin change is y_c \u2212 y_b. To ensure c wins vs b, we need y_c \u2212 y_b \u2265 m_{cb}. Minimizing y_b + y_c under y_b \u2265 D_b, y_c \u2265 D_c, y_c \u2212 y_b \u2265 m_{cb} yields y_b = D_b, y_c = max{D_c, m_{cb} + D_b}, and total mass \u03c6_a = max{D_b + D_c, m_{cb} + 2 D_b}. Feasibility is realized by choosing b>c>a for b-first and c>b>a for c-first additions (and adding an arbitrarily small slack to break ties). The symmetric argument gives \u03c6_b.\nWhy useful: This gives an exact, closed-form characterization at K=3 using only five observable tallies, enabling tighter certifiers and sharper lower bounds/benchmarks.\n\nCorollary 4 (Sample complexity for K = 3 sandwiched certifier).\nTo decide whether min{\u03c6_a, \u03c6_b} \u2264 \u03b5 with probability \u2265 1\u2212\u03b4, it suffices to estimate t_a({a,b,c}) for a \u2208 {a,b,c} and t_c({c,a}), t_c({c,b}) within \u00b1\u03c4 = \u0398(\u03b5), which requires m = \u0398((log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2) samples by Hoeffding. The map (these five scalars) \u21a6 min{\u03c6_a,\u03c6_b} is Lipschitz with constant \u2264 6 (sup norm), so choosing \u03c4 = \u03b5/12 leaves 2\u03c4 safety margin.\n\n## Examples / sanity checks\n- Counterexample in notes: a=0.38, b=0.35, c=0.27 with m_{cb}=0 (c beats b head-to-head). D_b=0.03, D_c=0.11, so \u03c6_a = max{0.14, 0 + 0.06} = 0.14, matching the exhibited 0.14 construction and strictly less than the c-first certificate 0.20.\n- Symmetric case: if c trails both in pairwise (m_{cb}, m_{ca} > 0) and a leads first round by \u0394 over both opponents (D_b=D_c=\u0394), then \u03c6_a = max{2\u0394, m_{cb} + 2\u0394}. If m_{cb} \u2265 0, \u03c6_a = m_{cb} + 2\u0394; eliminating b first analogously yields \u03c6_b = m_{ca} + 2\u0394; choose the smaller.\n\n## Obstacles / caveats\n- Lemma 2\u2019s Lipschitz constant M = K(K\u22121)/2 is crude and likely very loose; improving it (e.g., to O(K)) would strengthen sample bounds for the LP approach.\n- The LP-based certifier still requires selecting or searching over elimination orders \u03c0; naive enumeration is infeasible. A data-driven pruning of candidate orders is needed.\n- For K > 3, deriving similarly clean closed forms seems challenging; however, the fixed-\u03c0 LP and Lemma 2 already provide a path to polynomial-in-K sample complexity per candidate order.\n\n## Next steps\n- Prove rigorously that a-first additions are dominated in the K=3 optimization (tightening Proposition 3\u2019s proof) and document tie-breaking slack handling.\n- Extend the K=3 formula to include the case where c\u2019s pairwise ties occur; incorporate an explicit \u03be > 0 slack and show limits as \u03be \u2192 0^+ recover the stated form.\n- For general K and fixed \u03c0, attempt to improve the Lipschitz constant using the dual by bounding sup_{\u03bb feasible} ||\u03bb||_1, potentially via combinatorial properties of the top_{S_j} structure (aim for O(K)).\n- Design a two-tier algorithm: (i) run the c-first certificate; (ii) if inconclusive, infer a shortlist of plausible first eliminations or orders from estimated t_a(S) (e.g., candidates with small first-round deficits), and solve the corresponding LPs with confidence intervals propagated using Lemma 2.\n- Explore K-dependent lower bounds using Fano/packing over profiles differing on disjoint sets of S\u2019s tallies; start with top-of-triplet events to get \u03a9((log K)/\u03b5^2).\n"
