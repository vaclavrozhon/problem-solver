This addresses the counterexample and yields a sharper, sample-efficient certifier in the 3-candidate case.\n- LP for a fixed elimination order \u03c0: formalize primal and dual, isolate the sensitivity constant as sup\u2006||\u03bb||\u2081 over the dual feasible region; prove a tight, small bound for K = 3 and lay out what remains for general K.\n\n## Lemma (K = 3: exact two-type reduction for a targeted first elimination)\nSetup: Candidates {a,b,c}. We seek to make c the IRV winner by forcing a to be eliminated in round 1 and then ensuring c defeats b in the final. Let \u03b3 > 0 be an arbitrarily small slack (to remove tie-breaking dependence). Define tallies under the baseline profile P:\n- First-round shares: t_x(abc) for x \u2208 {a,b,c}.\n- Pairwise shares on {b,c}: t_b(bc), t_c(bc).\nLet A := [t_a(abc) \u2212 t_c(abc) + \u03b3]_+, B := [t_a(abc) \u2212 t_b(abc) + \u03b3]_+, D := t_b(bc) \u2212 t_c(bc) + \u03b3. Consider only adding mass in two types: c-first ballots (amount \u03b1 \u2265 0) and b-first ballots (amount \u03b2 \u2265 0). Then the elimination constraints t'_a + \u03b3 \u2264 t'_b and t'_a + \u03b3 \u2264 t'_c become\n- \u03b2 \u2265 B,\n- \u03b1 \u2265 A,\nand the final-round constraint t'_c(bc) \u2265 t'_b(bc) + \u03b3 becomes\n- \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2265 D.\nThe minimum total added mass \u03b1 + \u03b2 equals\n\n\u03b5_a^*(P) = min_{\u03b1,\u03b2 \u2265 0} {\u03b1 + \u03b2 : \u03b1 \u2265 A, \u03b2 \u2265 B, \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2265 D} = B + max{A, B + D}.\n\nMoreover, for this targeted strategy (eliminate a first), an optimal augmentation exists supported on only c-first and b-first ballots; any a-first ballots are strictly dominated.\n\nWhy useful here: This yields an exact minimal mass for the \u201celiminate a first, then beat b\u201d strategy and, together with the symmetric expression for eliminating b first, gives a tight K = 3 certification strictly stronger than the c-first certificate.\n\nProof sketch: The constraints follow from linearity:\n- First-round: \u03b1 increases t_c(abc) by \u03b1; \u03b2 increases t_b(abc) by \u03b2; t_a(abc) unchanged.\n- Final bc: \u03b1 adds entirely to t_c(bc); \u03b2 adds entirely to t_b(bc).\nThus \u03b1 \u2265 A, \u03b2 \u2265 B, and \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2265 D are necessary and sufficient for this strategy. Minimizing \u03b1 + \u03b2 under \u03b1 \u2265 max{A, \u03b2 + D} and \u03b2 \u2265 B is achieved at the smallest \u03b2, namely \u03b2 = B, giving \u03b1 = max{A, B + D}. Hence \u03b5_a^* = B + max{A, B + D}.\nDominance of a-first: Any unit of a-first mass decreases both t_b(abc) \u2212 t_a(abc) and t_c(abc) \u2212 t_a(abc) by 1, while its effect on bc pairwise is either +1 (if a-first ranks c \u227b b) or \u22121 (if a-first ranks b \u227b c). In the +1 case, one c-first ballot strictly improves both elimination margins and matches/improves the bc margin, so a-first is dominated by c-first. In the \u22121 case, one b-first ballot strictly improves the relevant elimination margin and matches the bc effect, so a-first is dominated by b-first. Therefore, a-first ballots are never optimal for the targeted elimination of a.\n\n## Corollary (K = 3: exact minimal augmentation for c)\nLet \u03b5_A(P) := f_c(P) = max{ [min{t_a(abc), t_b(abc)} \u2212 t_c(abc)]_+, [t_a(ac) \u2212 t_c(ac)]_+, [t_b(bc) \u2212 t_c(bc)]_+ } (the c-first certificate specialized to K = 3). Define \u03b5_a^* as above and \u03b5_b^* symmetrically (targeting b\u2019s first-round elimination). Then the true minimal added mass to make c win equals\n\n\u03b5^*(P;c) = min{ \u03b5_A(P), \u03b5_a^*(P), \u03b5_b^*(P) }.\n\nWhy: Any winning plan in K = 3 must either (i) ensure c survives round 1 and beats the round-2 opponent (captured by \u03b5_A), or (ii) force elimination of a in round 1 and then beat b (\u03b5_a^*), or (iii) force elimination of b in round 1 and then beat a (\u03b5_b^*). The two-type reduction shows (ii) and (iii) have exact costs, and a-first mass is never helpful under (ii) or (iii). Hence the minimum over these three strategies is exact.\n\nVerification on the counterexample: With t_a(abc)=0.38, t_b(abc)=0.35, t_c(abc)=0.27, and t_c(bc) \u2212 t_b(bc)=0.10 (so D = \u22120.10), we get A = 0.11, B = 0.03, and \u03b5_a^* = 0.03 + max{0.11, 0.03 \u2212 0.10} = 0.14, matching the exhibited augmentation (\u03b1,\u03b2)=(0.11,0.03).\n\n## Sampling complexity for the K = 3 certifier\nTo compute \u03b5_A, \u03b5_a^*, \u03b5_b^* within \u00b12\u03c4, it suffices to estimate the five numbers t_a(abc), t_b(abc), t_c(abc), t_b(bc), t_c(bc) within \u00b1\u03c4. Hoeffding + union bound over 5 events yields m = O((log(1/\u03b4))/\u03c4^2). A sound certifier: compute the plug-in values and declare c an \u03b5-winner if min{\u0125\u03b5_A, \u0125\u03b5_a^*, \u0125\u03b5_b^*} \u2264 \u03b5 \u2212 2\u03c4. This provides a K = 3 sample bound m = \u0398((log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2), improving on the general K-dependent union bound.\n\n## LP for a fixed elimination order \u03c0: primal/dual and sensitivity hook\nPrimal (fixed \u03c0 ending in c, slack \u03b3>0): variables y(r) \u2265 0; minimize \u2225y\u2225\u2081 subject to, for each round j and each a \u2208 S_j\\{\u03c0(j)}:\n\n(t_a(S_j) \u2212 t_{\u03c0(j)}(S_j)) + \u2211_r y(r)(1[top_{S_j}(r)=a] \u2212 1[top_{S_j}(r)=\u03c0(j)]) \u2265 \u03b3.\n\nDual: maximize \u2211_{j} \u2211_{a\u2260\u03c0(j)} \u03bb_{j,a} (\u03b3 \u2212 (t_a(S_j) \u2212 t_{\u03c0(j)}(S_j))) subject to, for every ranking r,\n\n\u2211_{j} \u2211_{a\u2260\u03c0(j)} \u03bb_{j,a} (1[top_{S_j}(r)=a] \u2212 1[top_{S_j}(r)=\u03c0(j)]) \u2264 1, and \u03bb \u2265 0.\n\nSensitivity: Let g_{j,a} := \u03b3 \u2212 (t_a(S_j) \u2212 t_{\u03c0(j)}(S_j)). The optimal value v(g) = max_{\u03bb\u2208\u039b} g^T \u03bb is 1-Lipschitz in g with respect to the norm \u2225\u00b7\u2225_\u039b defined by sup_{\u03bb\u2208\u039b} |\u00b7^T \u03bb|. A crude bound is |v(g+\u0394g) \u2212 v(g)| \u2264 (sup_{\u03bb\u2208\u039b} \u2225\u03bb\u2225\u2081) \u2225\u0394g\n\u2225_\u221e. Thus, a uniform sample bound follows once we upper-bound R_K := sup_{\u03bb\u2208\u039b} \u2225\u03bb\u2225\u2081 by poly(K).\n\n- For K = 3 targeted elimination (as above), the two-type reduction collapses \u039b to a 2-variable dual, yielding R_3 \u2264 2 and recovering the \u0398((log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2) sample complexity.\n- For general K, deriving an explicit bound R_K = poly(K) remains open. The main obstacle is coupling across rounds in the column constraints (each ranking contributes at most one +1 per round and at most one \u2212(\u2211_a \u03bb_{j,a}) when it tops the round-j loser), so max-over-round arguments must respect consistency of tops across S_j induced by a single ranking.\n\n## Obstacles and gaps relative to output.md\n- Output.md has a sufficient c-first certificate and uniform convergence; it does not yet capture the exact mixed-addition minimality for K = 3. The above lemma/corollary fill this gap with a simple, closed-form expression matching the counterexample.\n- The LP approach is noted in the notes/output but lacks a rigorous sensitivity bound. We have formalized the dual; bounding sup\u2006\u2225\u03bb\u2225\u2081 by poly(K) is the key missing step.\n\n## Next steps\n1) Formalize and prove the K = 3 corollary in full detail (including the symmetric \u03b5_b^* case) and add the sampling-based certifier with its tight sample complexity to output.md.\n2) Explore whether an analogous two-type (or few-type) reduction holds for K = 4 when targeting a specific first elimination and then relying on c-first thereafter; even a provable upper bound would be useful.\n3) For the LP sensitivity, attempt to construct a canonical dual feasible \u03bb with controlled \u2225\u03bb\u2225\u2081 (e.g., geometric decay along rounds) that achieves a constant-factor approximation to the optimum; this would imply a polynomial Lipschitz constant for an approximate value function and suffice for sample complexity via a bicriteria certifier.\n4) Investigate whether M_c(P) can be bounded within a constant factor by the maximum over |S| \u2208 {2,3} (if true, this would reduce the exponential dependence in the union bound). Try to find a counterexample or proof using elimination-path structure.\n"
