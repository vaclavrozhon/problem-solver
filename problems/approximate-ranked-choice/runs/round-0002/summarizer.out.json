  "summary_md": "This round resolved the K=3 gaps and clarified the LP sensitivity issue. Prover-02 gave a rigorous two-type reduction (c-first and one opponent-first) with \u03b3-slack that yields an exact closed-form cost for forcing a given first elimination; combined symmetrically this gives the exact minimal added mass to make target c win in K=3. The fixed-\u03c0 LP was written down with the correct dual; the crude Lemma 2 Lipschitz argument from Prover-01 was rejected by the verifier as incorrect. Instead, sensitivity must be handled via the dual-norm bound |\u0394v| \u2264 (sup_{\u03bb\u2208\u039b} ||\u03bb||_1) ||\u0394b||_\u221e, and bounding R_K := sup_{\u03bb\u2208\u039b} ||\u03bb||_1 by poly(K) is left open. As a consequence, the K=3 certifier is tight and sample-efficient (\u0398((log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2) samples using five tallies), while the general fixed-\u03c0 LP approach is sound but its polynomial-sample guarantee depends on the open problem of bounding sup ||\u03bb||_1. Verifier action items: add the rigorous K=3 theorem with \u03b3\u21920 limits; keep the c-first certificate; record the LP primal/dual and mark the general sensitivity bound open.",
  "highlights": [
    "K=3 two-type reduction (c-first + one opponent-first) is exact with \u03b3-slack; optimal cost for eliminating a first equals B + max{A, B + D} (notations as in the round).",
    "Global K=3 minimal augmentation equals min over the two targeted-first-elimination costs (\u03b5_a^*, \u03b5_b^*); evaluating this needs only five tallies.",
    "K=3 sample complexity: m = \u0398((log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2) via Hoeffding + union bound over the five scalars; plug-in certificiation with \u00b12\u03c4 safety works.",
    "Fixed-\u03c0 primal and correct dual are formalized; sensitivity must use dual-norm bound |v(b+\u0394)\u2212v(b)| \u2264 (sup_{\u03bb\u2208\u039b} ||\u03bb||_1) ||\u0394||_\u221e.",
    "Prover-01\u2019s earlier M = K(K\u22121)/2 Lipschitz claim is invalid (adding mass for one constraint can reduce others); sup ||\u03bb||_1 remains the key open quantity.",
    "Verifier recommended: incorporate rigorous K=3 theorem (with \u03b3\u21920), keep c-first certificate, and mark general LP sensitivity as open while attempting to bound R_K."

  "next_questions": [
    "Formalize and write the full K=3 theorem with \u03b3-slack, prove dominance of a-first ballots, give symmetric \u03b5_b^*, and take the \u03b3\u21920^+ limit for exact formulas.",
    "Attempt to bound R_K := sup_{\u03bb\u2208\u039b} ||\u03bb||_1 by poly(K) (start with constructive dual \u03bb or combinatorial arguments; aim for O(K) if possible).",
    "Investigate whether a few-type (constant-size) reduction can be proved for K=4 when targeting a specific first elimination, or find counterexamples."
