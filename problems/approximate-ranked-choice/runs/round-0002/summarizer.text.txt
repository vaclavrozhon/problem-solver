  "summary_md": "This round resolved the K=3 gaps and clarified the LP sensitivity issue. Prover-02 gave a rigorous two-type reduction (c-first and one opponent-first) with γ-slack that yields an exact closed-form cost for forcing a given first elimination; combined symmetrically this gives the exact minimal added mass to make target c win in K=3. The fixed-π LP was written down with the correct dual; the crude Lemma 2 Lipschitz argument from Prover-01 was rejected by the verifier as incorrect. Instead, sensitivity must be handled via the dual-norm bound |Δv| ≤ (sup_{λ∈Λ} ||λ||_1) ||Δb||_∞, and bounding R_K := sup_{λ∈Λ} ||λ||_1 by poly(K) is left open. As a consequence, the K=3 certifier is tight and sample-efficient (Θ((log(1/δ))/ε^2) samples using five tallies), while the general fixed-π LP approach is sound but its polynomial-sample guarantee depends on the open problem of bounding sup ||λ||_1. Verifier action items: add the rigorous K=3 theorem with γ→0 limits; keep the c-first certificate; record the LP primal/dual and mark the general sensitivity bound open.",
  "highlights": [
    "K=3 two-type reduction (c-first + one opponent-first) is exact with γ-slack; optimal cost for eliminating a first equals B + max{A, B + D} (notations as in the round).",
    "Global K=3 minimal augmentation equals min over the two targeted-first-elimination costs (ε_a^*, ε_b^*); evaluating this needs only five tallies.",
    "K=3 sample complexity: m = Θ((log(1/δ))/ε^2) via Hoeffding + union bound over the five scalars; plug-in certificiation with ±2τ safety works.",
    "Fixed-π primal and correct dual are formalized; sensitivity must use dual-norm bound |v(b+Δ)−v(b)| ≤ (sup_{λ∈Λ} ||λ||_1) ||Δ||_∞.",
    "Prover-01’s earlier M = K(K−1)/2 Lipschitz claim is invalid (adding mass for one constraint can reduce others); sup ||λ||_1 remains the key open quantity.",
    "Verifier recommended: incorporate rigorous K=3 theorem (with γ→0), keep c-first certificate, and mark general LP sensitivity as open while attempting to bound R_K."
