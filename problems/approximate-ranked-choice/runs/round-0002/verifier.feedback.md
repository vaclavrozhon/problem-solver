Overall, there is substantial progress, especially on the K = 3 case. However, a few rigor and correctness issues must be addressed before incorporating everything into output.md.

1) LP formulation and sensitivity.
- Prover 01: The stated dual in Lemma 1 is incorrect. There is no dual variable λ_{j,π(j)}; the correct dual constraint for each ranking r is ∑_{j}∑_{a≠π(j)} λ_{j,a} (1[top_{S_j}(r)=a] − 1[top_{S_j}(r)=π(j)]) ≤ 1 with λ ≥ 0, and the dual objective is ∑_{j,a} λ_{j,a}·(γ − (t_a(S_j) − t_{π(j)}(S_j))) if we move the baseline tallies to the RHS with slack γ > 0. Prover 02’s dual matches this standard form.
- Prover 01: Lemma 2’s M = K(K−1)/2 Lipschitz/sensitivity bound obtained by fixing constraints independently (adding τ mass per constraint) is not valid. Adding mass for one constraint can decrease other constraints’ LHS when the added ranking tops the round-j′ loser π(j′). The claimed “without decreasing any other” feature does not generally hold. A valid route is the dual-norm sensitivity: |v(b+Δ) − v(b)| ≤ (sup_{λ∈Λ} ||λ||_1) ||Δ||_∞. Establishing a poly(K) bound for sup ||λ||_1 remains the key open step. For K = 3, this constant is small (≤ 2) under the two-variable reduction.

2) K = 3 exact minimal augmentation.
- Prover 01’s Proposition 3 gives a correct closed form for the strategy “eliminate a first” (and symmetrically for “eliminate b first”) and matches the counterexample. However, the proof sketch needs a rigorous dominance argument excluding a-first ballots and a clean handling of tie-breaking via a small slack γ > 0.
- Prover 02 provides precisely these missing pieces: a two-type reduction with γ-slack, the linear constraints α ≥ A, β ≥ B, and α − β ≥ D, and the exact optimum α + β = B + max{A, B + D}. The dominance argument that a-first ballots are never optimal is sound: if an a-first ballot ranks c≻b, it is dominated by a c-first ballot; if it ranks b≻c, it is dominated by a b-first ballot. This yields an exact formula for each targeted first elimination, hence the global minimum for c is min{ε_a^*, ε_b^*}.
- Prover 02’s corollary includes ε_A (the c-first certificate specialized to K = 3) inside a minimum with ε_a^*, ε_b^*. This is redundant: any c-wins path must eliminate either a or b first, and ε_a^*, ε_b^* are exact for those two possibilities. Moreover, one can check ε_A ≥ min{ε_a^*, ε_b^*}, so min{ε_A, ε_a^*, ε_b^*} = min{ε_a^*, ε_b^*}. Including ε_A is harmless but unnecessary.

3) Sampling complexity for K = 3.
- Both provers converge on the key point: one needs only five numbers (the three first-round shares and two pairwise tallies) to evaluate ε^*(P;c) for K = 3. Thus a Hoeffding + union bound with m = Θ((log(1/δ))/ε^2) suffices. A coarse Lipschitz bound of ≤ 6 for the plug-in map is fine; any constant works with appropriate safety margin.

Action items for the next round:
- We will add to output.md a rigorous K = 3 theorem with γ-slack, the two-type reduction, the exact formulas ε_a^*(γ), ε_b^*(γ), and the limit as γ→0^+. Include the sampling corollary specialized to K = 3.
- Keep the general c-first certificate and uniform convergence results already in output.md (they are correct and broadly applicable), but do not add Prover 01’s Lemma 2; instead, add the correct primal/dual LP statement to notes and mark the sensitivity bound as open (per Prover 02).
- Next steps: (i) attempt to bound sup_{λ∈Λ} ||λ||_1 by poly(K), starting with structured dual constructions; (ii) explore whether a few-type reduction extends to K = 4 for targeted first eliminations; (iii) develop K-dependent lower bounds via packing over triplet/top-of-S events.
