# Problem Statement

We consider the problem of estimating the winner in an election run under **Ranked Choice Voting** (also known as *Instant-Runoff Voting*).  

Suppose there are \(K\) candidates. Each voter submits a complete ranking of these candidates. The voting rule proceeds in rounds: in each round, every ballot is assigned to the top-ranked candidate who is still in contention. The candidate with the smallest number of votes is eliminated (with ties broken according to a fixed deterministic rule), and this candidate is crossed out from all ballots. The process repeats until only one candidate remains, who is declared the winner.

Our goal is not to compute the exact winner from the full set of ballots, but rather to estimate a *robust* winner from a random sample of ballots. To make this precise, we introduce the notion of an **ε-winner**. A candidate \(c\) is called an ε-winner of an election profile if it is possible to add at most an ε-fraction of additional ballots to the election so that \(c\) becomes the winner under Ranked Choice Voting. In other words, \(c\) is “close” to being the true winner, in the sense that a small perturbation of the electorate would make \(c\) win. There may be more ε-winners. The real winner is ε-winner for any ε. 

The sampling model is as follows. We assume there is a large population of voters, each ballot drawn independently from the empirical distribution of this population. The algorithm does not see all the ballots; instead, it may sample ballots at random, with replacement. The task of the algorithm is: given parameters \(\varepsilon\) and \(\delta\), and access to at most \(m\) random ballots, output a candidate \(\hat{c}\) such that with probability at least \(1-\delta\), the candidate \(\hat{c}\) is an ε-winner of the true election.

The central question is: **what is the sample complexity of this problem?**  
That is, how many samples \(m\) are sufficient (and necessary) in order for an algorithm to reliably identify an ε-winner with probability at least \(1-\delta\)? We seek both upper bounds, by designing sampling algorithms and analyzing their guarantees, and lower bounds, by proving that no algorithm can succeed with significantly fewer than a certain number of samples.

# Corrected certificate and counterexample for K = 3

Notation: For a candidate set C with |C| = K and any nonempty S ⊆ C with c ∈ S and |S| ≥ 2, define t_a(S) = Pr[top among S is a] under the population distribution P over full rankings.

Corrected c-first certificate: Define

M_c(P) := max_{S ⊆ C, c ∈ S, |S| ≥ 2} [ min_{a ∈ S \ {c}} t_a(S) − t_c(S) ]_+.

If ε > M_c(P), then adding ε' (with 0 < ε' ≤ ε) mass of c-first ballots ensures that in every subset S encountered along any IRV elimination path, c's tally strictly exceeds the minimum among S \ {c}, so c cannot be eliminated and is the eventual winner. This yields a sound, distribution-free sufficient condition. Note the strict inequality requirement; in algorithmic use we maintain a margin so that ε' < ε and ties do not involve c.

Uniform estimation: The family {1[top_S(r) = a]} over all (a, S) has size K · 2^{K-1}. Hoeffding + union bound gives uniform estimation of all t_a(S) within ±τ using m = O((log(K · 2^{K-1}) + log(1/δ))/τ^2) samples. The plug-in estimate \hat M_c satisfies |\hat M_c − M_c| ≤ 2τ.

Counterexample to "K = 3 exactness" of c-first certificate: Let first-place shares be a = 0.38, b = 0.35, c = 0.27. Suppose c beats b head-to-head by margin m = 0.10 but loses to a by margin 0.20. The c-first certificate f_c requires ε ≥ max{0.35 − 0.27, 0.20, 0} = 0.20. However, adding α = 0.11 of c-first ballots and β = 0.03 of b-first ballots yields new first-place tallies c' = 0.38, b' = 0.38, a' = 0.38 (with tiny extra slack to make a uniquely minimal). Then a is eliminated first; in the final, the c vs b margin is m + α − β = 0.10 + 0.11 − 0.03 = 0.18 > 0, so c wins. Total added mass ≈ 0.14 < 0.20. Thus, for K = 3, the minimal augmentation need not equal the c-first-only threshold. A full characterization must allow mixed additions.

LP approach (status and caveats): For a fixed elimination order π, the condition that π(j) is eliminated at round j can be written linearly in terms of the baseline tallies t_a(S_j) and the additive contributions of the added mass y(r) via indicators 1[top_{S_j}(r) = a]. This leads to a linear program minimizing total added mass. To be rigorous one must encode the fixed tie-breaking rule (e.g., by strict inequalities or lexicographic tie constraints). Sensitivity of the LP optimum to perturbations in the t_a(S) (estimated from samples) is the key technical step for a polynomial-in-K sample bound using this approach; deriving an explicit O(poly(K)) Lipschitz constant remains open.

Lower bounds: The Ω((1/ε^2) log(1/δ)) dependence is necessary even for K = 2 (majority). Stronger K-dependent lower bounds (Ω((log K)/ε^2) or Ω(K/ε^2)) are plausible but require explicit constructions.

Next steps summary:
- Formalize LP with tie-breaking and derive sensitivity bounds.
- Provide a correct, closed-form minimal-augmentation characterization for K = 3 allowing mixed additions (compare two strategies: avoid facing a losing opponent by flipping the first-round loser vs. directly fixing the head-to-head deficit).
- Explore whether the worst-case S for the c-first certificate can be restricted by |S| ≤ r for a constant r.
- Build K-dependent lower bounds via Fano/packing constructions over top-of-S events.


## K = 3: exact minimal augmentation via two-type reduction

Let C = {a,b,c} and fix target winner c. Denote first-round shares p_x := t_x({a,b,c}) and pairwise shares t_x({b,c}), t_x({a,c}). To remove dependence on tie-breaking, introduce a slack γ > 0 and require strict separations in all inequalities.

Targeting elimination of a in round 1 and a c vs b final, it suffices to consider only two added ballot types: c-first (amount α ≥ 0) and b-first (amount β ≥ 0). These induce the linear constraints
- First round: p_a + 0 ≤ p_b + β − γ and p_a + 0 ≤ p_c + α − γ, i.e.,
  β ≥ B_γ := [p_a − p_b + γ]_+ and α ≥ A_γ := [p_a − p_c + γ]_+.
- Final: t'_c({b,c}) ≥ t'_b({b,c}) + γ, i.e., α − β ≥ D_γ := t_b({b,c}) − t_c({b,c}) + γ.
The minimum total mass is then
  ε_a^*(γ) = min_{α,β≥0} {α+β : α ≥ A_γ, β ≥ B_γ, α − β ≥ D_γ} = B_γ + max{A_γ, B_γ + D_γ}.
By a dominance argument, a-first additions are never optimal for this targeted strategy: if an a-first ballot ranks c ≻ b, it is dominated by a c-first ballot (strictly improves both elimination inequalities and matches the bc margin); if it ranks b ≻ c, it is dominated by a b-first ballot (improves the relevant elimination inequality and matches the bc margin). The symmetric expression ε_b^*(γ) is obtained by swapping a and b. The exact minimal augmentation to make c win is
  ε^*(γ; c) = min{ε_a^*(γ), ε_b^*(γ)}, and ε^*(c) = lim_{γ→0^+} ε^*(γ; c).
This matches the counterexample in the notes (a=0.38, b=0.35, c=0.27 with c beating b head-to-head): A_0=0.11, B_0=0.03, D_0=−0.10, hence ε_a^*(0) = 0.03 + max{0.11, −0.07} = 0.14.

Sampling for K = 3: Computing ε^*(γ; c) requires only five tallies: p_a, p_b, p_c, t_c({b,c}), t_c({a,c}). A Hoeffding + union bound over these five quantities gives m = Θ((log(1/δ))/ε^2) samples to decide whether ε^*(c) ≤ ε with probability ≥ 1 − δ.

## LP approach: primal/dual and sensitivity status (general K)

For a fixed elimination order π with remaining sets S_j = {π(j),...,π(K)}, add slack γ > 0 and consider variables y(r) ≥ 0 over rankings r. The primal is
- Minimize ∥y∥_1 subject to, for each j and a ∈ S_j \ {π(j)}:
  (t_a(S_j) − t_{π(j)}(S_j)) + ∑_r y(r)(1[top_{S_j}(r)=a] − 1[top_{S_j}(r)=π(j)]) ≥ γ.
Moving baseline tallies to the RHS gives constraints Ay ≥ b, with b_{j,a} = γ − (t_a(S_j) − t_{π(j)}(S_j)). The dual is
- Maximize ∑_{j}∑_{a≠π(j)} λ_{j,a}·(γ − (t_a(S_j) − t_{π(j)}(S_j))) subject to, for every ranking r,
  ∑_{j}∑_{a≠π(j)} λ_{j,a}(1[top_{S_j}(r)=a] − 1[top_{S_j}(r)=π(j)]) ≤ 1, and λ ≥ 0.
Sensitivity: v(b) = max_{λ∈Λ} b^T λ is 1-Lipschitz in the dual norm: |v(b+Δ) − v(b)| ≤ (sup_{λ∈Λ} ∥λ∥_1) ∥Δ∥_∞. Bounding R_K := sup_{λ∈Λ} ∥λ∥_1 by poly(K) would yield a polynomial-in-K sample bound for certifying a fixed π. For K = 3, the two-type reduction collapses Λ to two variables, giving R_3 ≤ 2. For general K, obtaining a good bound on R_K remains open; the per-constraint additive mass approach is invalid because a single added ranking can decrease other constraints when it tops the round-j loser.

## Checklist / next steps
- Formalize the K = 3 theorem and sampling corollary in output.md.
- Keep general c-first certifier and uniform convergence in output.md; use the K = 3 exact result when K = 3.
- Pursue a dual-based sensitivity bound sup_{λ∈Λ} ∥λ∥_1 = poly(K) or an approximate scheme with provable stability.
- Investigate few-type reductions for K ≥ 4 when targeting specific first eliminations.

# Theorems and results relevant to sampling ε-winners under IRV

We work with a candidate set C of size K. For any nonempty S ⊆ C and a ∈ S, let t_a(S) = Pr[top among S is a] under the population distribution P over full rankings. When we add a nonnegative measure y on rankings with total mass ||y||_1 ≤ ε, the tallies update additively: for each S and a ∈ S,

 t'_a(S) = t_a(S) + ∑_{r} y(r) 1[top_S(r) = a].

We assume ties in IRV are broken by a fixed deterministic rule, but we will enforce strict separations so that tie-breaking is irrelevant for our sufficient conditions.

Theorem 1 (Uniform convergence of top-of-S tallies).
Let F = {f_{a,S}(r) := 1[top_S(r) = a] : a ∈ S ⊆ C, |S| ≥ 1}. For m i.i.d. sampled ballots and any δ ∈ (0,1), with probability at least 1 − δ,

 sup_{a,S} |\hat t_a(S) − t_a(S)| ≤ τ

whenever m ≥ c (log(K · 2^{K-1}) + log(2/δ)) / τ^2 for a universal constant c.

Proof.
There are at most K · 2^{K-1} indicator functions f_{a,S}. Hoeffding’s inequality plus a union bound gives the claim.

Theorem 2 (Sufficient certificate via c-first additions).
Fix c ∈ C and define

 f_c(P) := max_{S ⊆ C, c ∈ S, |S| ≥ 2} [ min_{a ∈ S \ {c}} t_a(S) − t_c(S) ]_+.

If ε > f_c(P), then c is an ε-winner. In particular, adding any ε' with f_c(P) < ε' ≤ ε of c-first ballots (with arbitrary completion below c) makes c the IRV winner under the augmented profile.

Proof.
Adding ε' c-first ballots increases t_c(S) by ε' for every S with c ∈ S and leaves t_a(S) for a ≠ c unchanged. By the choice ε' > f_c(P), for each such S we have t'_c(S) = t_c(S) + ε' > min_{a∈S\{c}} t_a(S). Therefore, at any round in which the remaining set is S, c’s tally strictly exceeds the minimum among other candidates in S and hence c cannot be eliminated. Since some candidate is eliminated in every round, c survives all rounds and is the unique remaining candidate; thus c wins. Because the inequalities are strict, the fixed tie-breaking rule is irrelevant.

Corollary 3 (Sound certifier and its sample complexity).
Let τ > 0, and suppose m satisfies Theorem 1 so that with probability ≥ 1 − δ we have sup_{a,S} |\hat t_a(S) − t_a(S)| ≤ τ. Define the plug-in estimator

 \hat f_c := max_{S ⊆ C, c ∈ S, |S| ≥ 2} [ min_{a ∈ S \ {c}} \hat t_a(S) − \hat t_c(S) ]_+.

Then |\hat f_c − f_c(P)| ≤ 2τ for all c. Consequently, the following procedure is a sound certifier: compute \hat f_c for all c and output any c with \hat f_c ≤ ε − 2τ. With probability at least 1 − δ, every output c satisfies f_c(P) ≤ ε, and hence (by Theorem 2) is an ε-winner.

In particular, choosing τ = ε/4 and m = Θ((log(K · 2^{K-1}) + log(1/δ)) / ε^2) suffices for correctness with probability ≥ 1 − δ.

Proof.
For each fixed S containing c, the map (\{t_a(S)\}_{a∈S}) ↦ min_{a∈S\{c}} t_a(S) − t_c(S) is 2-Lipschitz in the sup norm (the minimum over a ≠ c perturbs by at most τ, and t_c by at most τ). Taking positive part and a maximum over S preserves Lipschitzness, giving |\hat f_c − f_c| ≤ 2τ. The rest follows from Theorem 2.

Proposition 4 (Necessary dependence on ε and δ).
Any algorithm that, with probability at least 1 − δ, outputs an ε-winner from m samples must have m = Ω((1/ε^2) log(1/δ)).

Proof.
For K = 2, IRV reduces to a two-candidate majority. Determining whether a given candidate is an ε-winner requires distinguishing whether their head-to-head share is ≥ 1/2 − ε versus ≤ 1/2 − 2ε, which is standard Bernoulli mean testing and requires Ω((1/ε^2) log(1/δ)) samples by classical information-theoretic or concentration lower bounds.

Remarks and scope.
- The certifier in Theorem 2 is sufficient but not necessary in general (and, in particular, is not exact for K = 3). It uses only c-first additions and enforces non-elimination of c in every potential round, which can be conservative.
- An exact minimal-augmentation characterization for a fixed elimination order can be expressed via a linear program over the added-ballot distribution; making this rigorous with a fixed tie-breaking rule and deriving a stability bound in terms of estimation error in the t_a(S) are promising next steps.


Theorem 5 (K = 3: exact minimal augmentation to make a target c win under IRV).
Let C = {a,b,c} and fix a target winner c. Write first-round shares p_x := t_x({a,b,c}) for x ∈ {a,b,c}, and pairwise tallies t_x({b,c}) and t_x({a,c}). Fix a deterministic tie-breaking rule and introduce a slack parameter γ > 0 to enforce strict separations so that tie-breaking is irrelevant.

Define, for the strategy that eliminates a in round 1 and then pits c against b in the final,
- A_γ := [p_a − p_c + γ]_+,
- B_γ := [p_a − p_b + γ]_+,
- D_γ := t_b({b,c}) − t_c({b,c}) + γ.
Let ε_a^*(γ) be the minimum total mass of added ballots required to realize this strategy. Then
  ε_a^*(γ) = B_γ + max{A_γ, B_γ + D_γ}.
Symmetrically, for the strategy that eliminates b first and then pits c against a, with
- A'_γ := [p_b − p_c + γ]_+,
- B'_γ := [p_b − p_a + γ]_+,
- D'_γ := t_a({a,c}) − t_c({a,c}) + γ,
we have
  ε_b^*(γ) = B'_γ + max{A'_γ, B'_γ + D'_γ}.
Consequently, the exact minimal total added mass to make c the IRV winner with strict margins γ is
  ε^*(γ; c) = min{ε_a^*(γ), ε_b^*(γ)},
and the exact minimal augmentation without slack is ε^*(c) = lim_{γ→0^+} ε^*(γ; c).

Proof.
Consider the strategy targeting a’s elimination in round 1 and a final between c and b. It suffices to consider added ballots of only two types: c-first ballots (total mass α ≥ 0) and b-first ballots (total mass β ≥ 0). Indeed, any added a-first ballot either ranks c ≻ b, in which case a c-first ballot strictly improves both first-round inequalities (it raises p_c and leaves p_b unchanged while an a-first raises p_a) and matches the bc final margin; or it ranks b ≻ c, in which case a b-first ballot strictly improves the relevant first-round inequality (it raises p_b while an a-first raises p_a) and matches the bc final margin. Thus a-first ballots are strictly dominated and never appear in an optimal solution.
Under α and β, the first-round tallies become p'_a = p_a, p'_b = p_b + β, and p'_c = p_c + α. Enforcing that a is strictly below both b and c in round 1 yields α ≥ A_γ and β ≥ B_γ. In the final between b and c, each added c-first ballot contributes 1 to t'_c({b,c}) and each added b-first ballot contributes 1 to t'_b({b,c}); hence t'_c({b,c}) − t'_b({b,c}) = (t_c({b,c}) − t_b({b,c})) + (α − β). The strict final-round win requires α − β ≥ D_γ. Therefore the feasible region is exactly
  { (α,β) ∈ R_+^2 : α ≥ A_γ, β ≥ B_γ, α − β ≥ D_γ }.
Minimizing α + β over this polyhedron is achieved at β = B_γ and α = max{A_γ, B_γ + D_γ}, yielding ε_a^*(γ) = B_γ + max{A_γ, B_γ + D_γ}. The expression for ε_b^*(γ) follows symmetrically. Any winning IRV run with three candidates must eliminate either a or b in the first round and then elect c in the final; hence the minimal total added mass is the minimum of the two strategy optima. Finally, sending γ → 0^+ gives ε^*(c).

Corollary 6 (Sampling complexity for K = 3 exact certifier).
Fix ε, δ ∈ (0,1). Let \hat p_x, \widehat{t}_x({b,c}), \widehat{t}_x({a,c}) be empirical estimates of p_x and the pairwise tallies from m i.i.d. ballots. There exists a universal constant c such that if
  m ≥ c · (log(5/δ)) / τ^2,
then with probability at least 1 − δ we have sup error ≤ τ simultaneously for the five quantities {p_a, p_b, p_c, t_c({b,c}), t_c({a,c})}. The maps (p_a,p_b,p_c,t_c({b,c}),t_c({a,c})) ↦ ε_a^*(γ), ε_b^*(γ), and ε^*(γ; c) are Lipschitz with a universal constant (e.g., ≤ 6) under the sup norm. Consequently, the plug-in decision “declare c an ε-winner if \min{\widehat{ε}_a^*(γ), \widehat{ε}_b^*(γ)} ≤ ε − 2Lτ” is correct with probability at least 1 − δ, where L is a Lipschitz constant (e.g., L = 6). Choosing τ = Θ(ε) yields m = Θ((log(1/δ))/ε^2).

Remarks.
- This exact characterization for K = 3 strictly improves the c-first sufficient certificate (Theorem 2) and matches the counterexample in the notes.
- For general K, an exact minimal-augmentation characterization for a fixed elimination order can be written as a linear program. A dual-based sensitivity analysis suggests that a polynomial-in-K sample bound per fixed order will follow from a poly(K) bound on sup_{λ∈Λ} ∥λ∥_1 over the dual feasible region; establishing such a bound remains open.


=== Round 1 Summary ===

This round compared two parallel approaches for certifying that candidate c can be made an IRV winner by adding ≤ε mass: (i) a simple, conservative "c‑first" certificate M_c / f_c based on top-within-S tallies (sufficient only), and (ii) an LP that, for a fixed elimination order, exactly characterizes the minimal added mass. Both provers proved uniform convergence for the top-within-S indicators (union bound over ≤K·2^{K-1} functions) giving a plug-in estimator with additive error control (≤2τ). Sample complexity for the certifier is sound but exponential in K (≈O(K·2^{K-1}/ε^2)). The verifier corrected key issues: the deficit must compare c to other candidates in S (typo), tie-breaking requires strict inequalities or explicit encoding in the LP, and the claimed K=3 exactness (for arbitrary added ballots) is not generally true. Solid lower bound: Ω((log(1/δ))/ε^2) via K=2 holds; K-dependent lower bounds remain conjectural. (Sources: prover-01, prover-02, verifier-feedback.)


=== Round 2 Summary ===

This round resolved the K=3 gaps and clarified the LP sensitivity issue. Prover-02 gave a rigorous two-type reduction (c-first and one opponent-first) with γ-slack that yields an exact closed-form cost for forcing a given first elimination; combined symmetrically this gives the exact minimal added mass to make target c win in K=3. The fixed-π LP was written down with the correct dual; the crude Lemma 2 Lipschitz argument from Prover-01 was rejected by the verifier as incorrect. Instead, sensitivity must be handled via the dual-norm bound |Δv| ≤ (sup_{λ∈Λ} ||λ||_1) ||Δb||_∞, and bounding R_K := sup_{λ∈Λ} ||λ||_1 by poly(K) is left open. As a consequence, the K=3 certifier is tight and sample-efficient (Θ((log(1/δ))/ε^2) samples using five tallies), while the general fixed-π LP approach is sound but its polynomial-sample guarantee depends on the open problem of bounding sup ||λ||_1. Verifier action items: add the rigorous K=3 theorem with γ→0 limits; keep the c-first certificate; record the LP primal/dual and mark the general sensitivity bound open.


=== Previous Round Feedback ===

Overall, there is substantial progress, especially on the K = 3 case. However, a few rigor and correctness issues must be addressed before incorporating everything into output.md.

1) LP formulation and sensitivity.
- Prover 01: The stated dual in Lemma 1 is incorrect. There is no dual variable λ_{j,π(j)}; the correct dual constraint for each ranking r is ∑_{j}∑_{a≠π(j)} λ_{j,a} (1[top_{S_j}(r)=a] − 1[top_{S_j}(r)=π(j)]) ≤ 1 with λ ≥ 0, and the dual objective is ∑_{j,a} λ_{j,a}·(γ − (t_a(S_j) − t_{π(j)}(S_j))) if we move the baseline tallies to the RHS with slack γ > 0. Prover 02’s dual matches this standard form.
- Prover 01: Lemma 2’s M = K(K−1)/2 Lipschitz/sensitivity bound obtained by fixing constraints independently (adding τ mass per constraint) is not valid. Adding mass for one constraint can decrease other constraints’ LHS when the added ranking tops the round-j′ loser π(j′). The claimed “without decreasing any other” feature does not generally hold. A valid route is the dual-norm sensitivity: |v(b+Δ) − v(b)| ≤ (sup_{λ∈Λ} ||λ||_1) ||Δ||_∞. Establishing a poly(K) bound for sup ||λ||_1 remains the key open step. For K = 3, this constant is small (≤ 2) under the two-variable reduction.

2) K = 3 exact minimal augmentation.
- Prover 01’s Proposition 3 gives a correct closed form for the strategy “eliminate a first” (and symmetrically for “eliminate b first”) and matches the counterexample. However, the proof sketch needs a rigorous dominance argument excluding a-first ballots and a clean handling of tie-breaking via a small slack γ > 0.
- Prover 02 provides precisely these missing pieces: a two-type reduction with γ-slack, the linear constraints α ≥ A, β ≥ B, and α − β ≥ D, and the exact optimum α + β = B + max{A, B + D}. The dominance argument that a-first ballots are never optimal is sound: if an a-first ballot ranks c≻b, it is dominated by a c-first ballot; if it ranks b≻c, it is dominated by a b-first ballot. This yields an exact formula for each targeted first elimination, hence the global minimum for c is min{ε_a^*, ε_b^*}.
- Prover 02’s corollary includes ε_A (the c-first certificate specialized to K = 3) inside a minimum with ε_a^*, ε_b^*. This is redundant: any c-wins path must eliminate either a or b first, and ε_a^*, ε_b^* are exact for those two possibilities. Moreover, one can check ε_A ≥ min{ε_a^*, ε_b^*}, so min{ε_A, ε_a^*, ε_b^*} = min{ε_a^*, ε_b^*}. Including ε_A is harmless but unnecessary.

3) Sampling complexity for K = 3.
- Both provers converge on the key point: one needs only five numbers (the three first-round shares and two pairwise tallies) to evaluate ε^*(P;c) for K = 3. Thus a Hoeffding + union bound with m = Θ((log(1/δ))/ε^2) suffices. A coarse Lipschitz bound of ≤ 6 for the plug-in map is fine; any constant works with appropriate safety margin.

Action items for the next round:
- We will add to output.md a rigorous K = 3 theorem with γ-slack, the two-type reduction, the exact formulas ε_a^*(γ), ε_b^*(γ), and the limit as γ→0^+. Include the sampling corollary specialized to K = 3.
- Keep the general c-first certificate and uniform convergence results already in output.md (they are correct and broadly applicable), but do not add Prover 01’s Lemma 2; instead, add the correct primal/dual LP statement to notes and mark the sensitivity bound as open (per Prover 02).
- Next steps: (i) attempt to bound sup_{λ∈Λ} ||λ||_1 by poly(K), starting with structured dual constructions; (ii) explore whether a few-type reduction extends to K = 4 for targeted first eliminations; (iii) develop K-dependent lower bounds via packing over triplet/top-of-S events.
