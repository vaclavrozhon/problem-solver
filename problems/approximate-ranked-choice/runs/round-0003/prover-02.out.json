This yields a clean Lipschitz constant and a polynomial-in-K sample bound for certifying any fixed elimination order \u03c0.\n- Record a general \u201ctwo-type along a spine\u201d sufficient certificate for K \u2265 4 (eliminate all non-spine opponents before a final between c and a chosen b), which subsumes the K = 3 formula when only one non-spine opponent exists.\n- Provide a K-dependent lower-bound template via Fano, indicating an \u03a9((log K)/\u03b5^2) necessity in general.\n\nLemma 1 (Dual 1-norm bound for a fixed elimination order).\nFix an elimination order \u03c0 on K candidates and slack \u03b3 > 0. Let S_j = {\u03c0(j),\u2026,\u03c0(K)} for j = 1,\u2026,K\u22121. Consider the LP (minimize total added mass) with constraints\n(t_a(S_j) \u2212 t_{\u03c0(j)}(S_j)) + \u2211_r y(r)(1[top_{S_j}(r)=a] \u2212 1[top_{S_j}(r)=\u03c0(j)]) \u2265 \u03b3\nfor every j and a \u2208 S_j \\ {\u03c0(j)}. Its dual feasible set \u039b_\u03c0 consists of \u03bb \u2265 0 such that, for every ranking r,\n\u2211_{j=1}^{K-1} \u2211_{a\u2208S_j\\{\u03c0(j)}} \u03bb_{j,a}(1[top_{S_j}(r)=a] \u2212 1[top_{S_j}(r)=\u03c0(j)]) \u2264 1.\nThen sup_{\u03bb\u2208\u039b_\u03c0} ||\u03bb||_1 \u2264 K.\n\nProof.\nFor each candidate x, consider the \u201cchampion\u201d ranking r_x that places x at the very top (ties arbitrary below). Then for every j with x \u2208 S_j \\ {\u03c0(j)}, we have top_{S_j}(r_x) = x, while top_{S_j}(r_x) \u2260 \u03c0(j). The dual constraint for r_x reduces to \u2211_{j: x\u2208S_j\\{\u03c0(j)}} \u03bb_{j,x} \u2264 1. Summing these K inequalities over x gives \u2211_{x} \u2211_{j: x\u2208S_j\\{\u03c0(j)}} \u03bb_{j,x} \u2264 K. The left-hand side is exactly \u2211_{j}\u2211_{a\u2208S_j\\{\u03c0(j)}} \u03bb_{j,a} = ||\u03bb||_1. Hence ||\u03bb||_1 \u2264 K for all \u03bb \u2208 \u039b_\u03c0, proving the claim.\n\nCorollary 2 (Lipschitz sensitivity for a fixed \u03c0).\nLet v_\u03c0(b) denote the optimal value of the primal as a function of the right-hand sides b_{j,a} = \u03b3 \u2212 (t_a(S_j) \u2212 t_{\u03c0(j)}(S_j)). Then for any perturbation \u0394,\n|v_\u03c0(b+\u0394) \u2212 v_\u03c0(b)| \u2264 K ||\u0394||_\u221e.\n\nProof.\nBy LP duality, v_\u03c0(b) = max_{\u03bb\u2208\u039b_\u03c0} b^T \u03bb. Hence |v_\u03c0(b+\u0394) \u2212 v_\u03c0(b)| = |max_{\u03bb} (b+\u0394)^T \u03bb \u2212 max_{\u03bb} b^T \u03bb| \u2264 sup_{\u03bb\u2208\u039b_\u03c0} |\u0394^T \u03bb| \u2264 (sup_{\u03bb} ||\u03bb||_1) ||\u0394||_\u221e \u2264 K ||\u0394||_\u221e by Lemma 1.\n\nCorollary 3 (Sampling to certify a fixed order \u03c0).\nFor a fixed \u03c0, the constraints involve at most M_\u03c0 := \u2211_{j=1}^{K-1} |S_j| \u2264 K(K\u22121)/2 distinct top-of-S indicators. Hoeffding plus a union bound implies that with m \u2265 c (log(M_\u03c0) + log(2/\u03b4)) / \u03c4^2 samples, we have\nsup_{j,a} |(\\hat t_a(S_j) \u2212 \\hat t_{\u03c0(j)}(S_j)) \u2212 (t_a(S_j) \u2212 t_{\u03c0(j)}(S_j))| \u2264 2\u03c4\nwith probability \u2265 1 \u2212 \u03b4. Therefore, |\\hat v_\u03c0 \u2212 v_\u03c0| \u2264 K \u00b7 2\u03c4. Setting 2K\u03c4 = \u03b7, it suffices to take m = \u0398((log K + log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b7^2).\n\nUsefulness: This gives a polynomial-in-K sample bound to accurately evaluate the minimal augmentation for any fixed \u03c0. As a one-sided, sound certifier: if \\hat v_\u03c0 \u2264 \u03b5 \u2212 \u03b7, then v_\u03c0 \u2264 \u03b5 and the target winner is an \u03b5-winner via \u03c0. This does not require uniform estimation over all \u03c0.\n\nRemark (On selecting \u03c0).\nSearching all \u03c0 is computationally large. Practically, evaluate \\hat v_\u03c0 for a small set of candidate orders (e.g., the empirical IRV order; orders obtained by swapping adjacent eliminations; or a handful of \u201cspine\u201d orders defined below). Whenever any order certifies (\\hat v_\u03c0 \u2264 \u03b5 \u2212 \u03b7), the certificate is valid. Guaranteeing success for all instances still requires either a structural approximation result over orders or a broader (potentially exponential) uniform estimation; establishing such an approximation is open.\n\nProposition 4 (Spine two-type sufficient certificate for general K).\nFix c and choose a \u201cspine opponent\u201d b \u2260 c. Let \u03b3 > 0. Define\nA_\u03b3(b) := max_{S \u2287 {b,c}} max_{a \u2208 S\\{b,c}} [t_a(S) \u2212 t_c(S) + \u03b3]_+,\nB_\u03b3(b) := max_{S \u2287 {b,c}} max_{a \u2208 S\\{b,c}} [t_a(S) \u2212 t_b(S) + \u03b3]_+,\nD_\u03b3(b) := t_b({b,c}) \u2212 t_c({b,c}) + \u03b3.\nIf one adds \u03b1 c-first and \u03b2 b-first ballots with \u03b1 \u2265 A_\u03b3(b), \u03b2 \u2265 B_\u03b3(b), and \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2265 D_\u03b3(b), then along any elimination path that always removes candidates in S\\{b,c} before either b or c, every such a \u2208 S\\{b,c} is eliminated strictly before {b,c}, and c defeats b in the final. Hence c is the winner. The total added mass \u03b1+\u03b2 is minimized by\n\u03b5_spine(b;\u03b3) = B_\u03b3(b) + max{A_\u03b3(b), B_\u03b3(b) + D_\u03b3(b)}.\n\nProof (sketch).\n- First-round and all intermediate rounds that involve S \u2287 {b,c}: For every a \u2208 S\\{b,c}, the constraints \u03b1 \u2265 A_\u03b3(b) and \u03b2 \u2265 B_\u03b3(b) ensure p'_a(S) < min{p'_b(S), p'_c(S)} with strict margin \u03b3, so a is never the minimal among S.\n- Final: Each c-first (resp. b-first) ballot contributes +1 to t'_c({b,c}) (resp. t'_b({b,c})). The condition \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2265 D_\u03b3(b) enforces a strict c-over-b final.\n- Optimality under these constraints is the same 2D linear minimization as K = 3: set \u03b2 = B_\u03b3(b) and \u03b1 = max{A_\u03b3(b), B_\u03b3(b) + D_\u03b3(b)}.\nWhen K = 3, the maxima in A_\u03b3, B_\u03b3 collapse to the unique S = {a,b,c}, recovering the exact formula from the notes. For K \u2265 4, this remains a sound (generally non-tight) certificate that uses only two ballot types.\n\nExample (K = 4, certificate beating c-first-only bound).\nLet first-round shares be p_c = 0.24, p_b = 0.26, p_d = 0.25, p_a = 0.25. Suppose for all S \u2287 {b,c} and a \u2208 S\\{b,c}, the gaps t_a(S) \u2212 t_b(S) \u2264 0.03 and t_a(S) \u2212 t_c(S) \u2264 0.09, while t_b({b,c}) \u2212 t_c({b,c}) = 0.04. Then \u03b5_spine(b;0) = 0.03 + max{0.09, 0.07} = 0.12, while the c-first certificate requires max_S min_{x\u2260c}(t_x(S) \u2212 t_c(S))_+ \u2265 0.09. If the worst S for c-first is larger than 0.12 (possible when some S inflates a over both c and b while keeping b close to c head-to-head), the spine certificate may strictly improve the bound.\n\nLower bound sketch: \u03a9((log K)/\u03b5^2) via packing.\nConstruct a family {P_s}_{s=1}^K of ranking distributions such that (i) under P_s, candidate s is an \u03b5/4-winner while every x \u2260 s is not an \u03b5/2-winner; (ii) the pairwise KL divergences satisfy KL(P_s||P_{s\u2032}) \u2264 C \u03b5^2 for a constant C. For instance, start from an impartial culture and introduce a small Mallows-type tilt that makes s pairwise beat all others by margin \u0398(\u03b5) while keeping all other interactions symmetric; IRV need not elect s, but an O(\u03b5) augmentation (along an appropriate spine with b chosen adversarially) suffices to force s to win, whereas forcing any x \u2260 s would require > \u03b5/2. Standard Fano\u2019s inequality then implies that any algorithm identifying an \u03b5/2-winner with probability \u2265 2/3 must use m \u2265 c (log K)/\u03b5^2 samples. Formalizing one such tilt with explicit verification of (i)\u2013(ii) is a concrete next step.\n\nObstacles\n- Tightness of the K-bound: while ||\u03bb||_1 \u2264 K is sufficient for polynomial sensitivity, it may be loose; sharpening it (e.g., to O(log K)) would further reduce the safety margin needed.\n- Selecting \u03c0 without exponential exploration remains open. Either structural approximation over a poly(K)-sized family of orders or data-dependent strategies with uniform generalization bounds (beyond naive union over (a,S)) are needed.\n- The spine certificate is sufficient, not necessary, for K \u2265 4; characterizing exact minimal augmentation even for a fixed \u03c0 seems to require more than two ballot types in general.\n\nNext steps\n- Elevate Lemma 1 and Corollary 2 into notes/proofs; add Corollary 3 as a sampling guarantee for any fixed order \u03c0.\n- Explore poly(K)-sized families of \u201cspine\u201d orders that approximate optimal LP value within an additive \u03b1 = o(\u03b5), enabling polynomial sample guarantees without exponential union bounds.\n- Formalize the Fano-based \u03a9((log K)/\u03b5^2) lower bound with an explicit tilted impartial-culture construction and full verification of \u03b5-winner separations.\n- Investigate whether the dual K-bound plus structural constraints on rankings can yield Rademacher-style uniform controls over {v_\u03c0}_\u03c0 without enumerating all (a,S).\n\nMinor refinement (K = 3 plug-in Lipschitz constant).\nFor K = 3, the map (p_a,p_b,p_c,t_c({b,c}),t_c({a,c})) \u21a6 \u03b5^*(\u03b3;c) is 6-Lipschitz in the sup norm: A_\u03b3, B_\u03b3, D_\u03b3 each vary by \u2264 2\u03c4 under \u03c4-perturbations of their inputs, and \u03b5^* = B_\u03b3 + max{A_\u03b3, B_\u03b3 + D_\u03b3} varies by at most 6\u03c4. Choosing \u03c4 = \u03b5/12 gives m = \u0398((log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2) for a safe plug-in decision."
