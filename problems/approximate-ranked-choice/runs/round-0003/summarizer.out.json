  "summary_md": "This round formalized sound sampling certificates and exact/sufficient augmentation formulas for IRV \u03b5-winners. Key results: a distribution-free c-first sufficient certificate M_c with uniform-convergence sampling (m = \u0398((K + log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2)); an exact K=3 closed-form two-type minimal-augmentation \u03b5^*(c) computable from five tallies with m = \u0398((log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2); a sound general-K chain-based two-type certificate (pivot b) depending on O(K) subset tallies; and an LP fixed-order formulation that exactly characterizes minimal augmentation but whose dual-sensitivity constant R_K (sup ||\u03bb||_1) is open, blocking a proven polynomial-in-K sample bound. The universal lower bound \u03a9((1/\u03b5^2) log(1/\u03b4)) holds. Citations: notes (round), proofs.md, output.md.",

    "Sound c-first certificate M_c := max_{S\u2286C, c\u2208S}[min_{a\u2260c} t_a(S)\u2212t_c(S)]_+; if \u03b5>M_c adding \u03b5 c-first ballots makes c win. Uniform estimation gives m = \u0398((K+log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2).",
    "Exact K=3 two-type reduction: \u03b5^*(c)=min{\u03b5_a^*,\u03b5_b^*} with closed-form \u03b5_a^*=B_\u03b3+max{A_\u03b3,B_\u03b3+D_\u03b3}; needs five tallies and m=\u0398((log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2).",
    "Counterexample: c-first certificate can be loose for K=3\u2014mixed additions may need strictly less mass (example a=0.38,b=0.35,c=0.27 yields 0.14 vs 0.20).",
    "General-K chain-based two-type sufficient certificate (pivot b): define elimination chain e_j and A_b,B_b,D_{b,c}; minimal two-type mass = B_b+max{A_b,B_b+D_{b,c}}; depends on O(K) subset tallies.",
    "LP fixed-order primal/dual exactly characterizes minimal added mass, but sensitivity bound depends on R_K = sup_{\u03bb\u2208\u039b} ||\u03bb||_1; bounding R_K=poly(K) is open, preventing a provable poly(K) sample guarantee for exact certification.",
    "Information-theoretic lower bound: m = \u03a9((1/\u03b5^2) log(1/\u03b4)) is necessary (even for K=2); K-dependent lower bounds remain to be formalized."

    "Prove (or disprove) a polynomial-in-K bound on the dual norm R_K = sup_{\u03bb\u2208\u039b} ||\u03bb||_1 for the fixed-order LP (or find an alternative stability/sensitivity argument).",
    "Formalize and add the chain-based certificate to proofs.md and construct a K\u22654 instance where a third ballot type strictly reduces required augmentation vs the two-type bound."
