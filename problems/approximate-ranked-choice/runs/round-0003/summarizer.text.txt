{"summary_md":"This round formalized sound sampling certificates and exact/sufficient augmentation formulas for IRV ε-winners. Key results: a distribution-free c-first sufficient certificate M_c with uniform-convergence sampling (m = Θ((K + log(1/δ))/ε^2)); an exact K=3 closed-form two-type minimal-augmentation ε^*(c) computable from five tallies with m = Θ((log(1/δ))/ε^2); a sound general-K chain-based two-type certificate (pivot b) depending on O(K) subset tallies; and an LP fixed-order formulation that exactly characterizes minimal augmentation but whose dual-sensitivity constant R_K (sup ||λ||_1) is open, blocking a proven polynomial-in-K sample bound. The universal lower bound Ω((1/ε^2) log(1/δ)) holds.
