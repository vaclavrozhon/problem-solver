Overall: Good progress on sound sufficient conditions and K=3 exactness, but two major issues surfaced: (i) a flawed general-K “two-type” reduction that only looks at first-round shares, and (ii) incorrect dual-norm bounds for the fixed-order LP. We can safely advance by recording the K=3 exact formula and a sound general-K chain-based two-type certificate; the dual sensitivity bound remains open.

Prover 1: Your general-K two-type theorem is unsound. You replace all round-j tallies t_w(S) by first-round shares p_w, concluding that nonfinal candidates are eliminated in ascending order of p_w. In IRV, t_w(S) can be much larger than p_w after transfers. Minimal counterexample (K=4): Take p = (p_a, p_b, p_c, p_y) = (0.26, 0.26, 0.23, 0.25). Suppose after eliminating a, the round-2 tallies on S={b,c,y} are (t_b(S), t_c(S), t_y(S)) = (0.40, 0.25, 0.35). Your bounds give A* = max_w(p_w − p_c)_+ = 0.03 and B* = max_w(p_w − p_y)_+ = 0.01, but they do not ensure c and y beat b in S since b’s tally is 0.40. Any proof must use t_w(S) for the actual S, not just p_w.

Prover 2 and 3: The dual 1-norm bounds (≤K and ≤K−1) are incorrect. In the dual constraint for the ranking r_x that places x first, there is a negative term at j = pos_π(x): −∑_{a∈S_j\{x}} λ_{j,a}. Dropping this term yields ∑_{j<pos(x)} λ_{j,x} ≤ 1, from which summing over x wrongly gives ||λ||_1 ≤ K (or K−1). Including the negative term, the sum over x cancels and yields 0 ≤ K, providing no bound. Hence the claimed Lipschitz sensitivity constants do not follow. Also, the K=3 Lipschitz constant L=3 asserted by Prover 3 is too small: A, B, D each have sup-norm Lipschitz constant 2, so a safe bound is L ≤ 6.

Prover 4: Your chain-based two-type certificate is sound and aligns with IRV mechanics: fix b, follow the baseline minimal-of-others chain e_1,…,e_{K−2} (with the election’s tie-breaking), and require α ≥ max_j[t_{e_j}(S_j) − t_c(S_j) + γ]_+ and β ≥ max_j[t_{e_j}(S_j) − t_b(S_j) + γ]_+, plus α − β ≥ t_b({b,c}) − t_c({b,c}) + γ. This ensures elimination along that chain and a strict c-over-b final; the optimal two-type mass is B + max{A, B + D}. Minor fix: when stating dominance, note that rankings with top_{S_j} = e_j harm constraints and are excluded at optimum, but they do not contribute zero.

Next steps:
- Formalize and add the chain-based two-type certificate (general K) and the K=3 exact formula to proofs.md; keep the c-first certificate and its sampling guarantee.
- Attempt a separation example for K≥4 where two-type is suboptimal (requires a third type).
- Revisit the LP dual bound with the negative terms intact; explore alternative dual test rankings or structural decompositions to bound sup||λ||_1.
- Lower bounds: formalize a Fano/packing instance yielding Ω((log K)/ε^2) for any certificate that must identify a favorable opponent among K−1.
