  "feedback_md": "Overall: Good progress on sound sufficient conditions and K=3 exactness, but two major issues surfaced: (i) a flawed general-K \u201ctwo-type\u201d reduction that only looks at first-round shares, and (ii) incorrect dual-norm bounds for the fixed-order LP. We can safely advance by recording the K=3 exact formula and a sound general-K chain-based two-type certificate; the dual sensitivity bound remains open.\n\nProver 1: Your general-K two-type theorem is unsound. You replace all round-j tallies t_w(S) by first-round shares p_w, concluding that nonfinal candidates are eliminated in ascending order of p_w. In IRV, t_w(S) can be much larger than p_w after transfers. Minimal counterexample (K=4): Take p = (p_a, p_b, p_c, p_y) = (0.26, 0.26, 0.23, 0.25). Suppose after eliminating a, the round-2 tallies on S={b,c,y} are (t_b(S), t_c(S), t_y(S)) = (0.40, 0.25, 0.35). Your bounds give A* = max_w(p_w \u2212 p_c)_+ = 0.03 and B* = max_w(p_w \u2212 p_y)_+ = 0.01, but they do not ensure c and y beat b in S since b\u2019s tally is 0.40. Any proof must use t_w(S) for the actual S, not just p_w.\n\nProver 2 and 3: The dual 1-norm bounds (\u2264K and \u2264K\u22121) are incorrect. In the dual constraint for the ranking r_x that places x first, there is a negative term at j = pos_\u03c0(x): \u2212\u2211_{a\u2208S_j\\{x}} \u03bb_{j,a}. Dropping this term yields \u2211_{j<pos(x)} \u03bb_{j,x} \u2264 1, from which summing over x wrongly gives ||\u03bb||_1 \u2264 K (or K\u22121). Including the negative term, the sum over x cancels and yields 0 \u2264 K, providing no bound. Hence the claimed Lipschitz sensitivity constants do not follow. Also, the K=3 Lipschitz constant L=3 asserted by Prover 3 is too small: A, B, D each have sup-norm Lipschitz constant 2, so a safe bound is L \u2264 6.\n\nProver 4: Your chain-based two-type certificate is sound and aligns with IRV mechanics: fix b, follow the baseline minimal-of-others chain e_1,\u2026,e_{K\u22122} (with the election\u2019s tie-breaking), and require \u03b1 \u2265 max_j[t_{e_j}(S_j) \u2212 t_c(S_j) + \u03b3]_+ and \u03b2 \u2265 max_j[t_{e_j}(S_j) \u2212 t_b(S_j) + \u03b3]_+, plus \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2265 t_b({b,c}) \u2212 t_c({b,c}) + \u03b3. This ensures elimination along that chain and a strict c-over-b final; the optimal two-type mass is B + max{A, B + D}. Minor fix: when stating dominance, note that rankings with top_{S_j} = e_j harm constraints and are excluded at optimum, but they do not contribute zero.\n\nNext steps:\n- Formalize and add the chain-based two-type certificate (general K) and the K=3 exact formula to proofs.md; keep the c-first certificate and its sampling guarantee.\n- Attempt a separation example for K\u22654 where two-type is suboptimal (requires a third type).\n- Revisit the LP dual bound with the negative terms intact; explore alternative dual test rankings or structural decompositions to bound sup||\u03bb||_1.\n- Lower bounds: formalize a Fano/packing instance yielding \u03a9((log K)/\u03b5^2) for any certificate that must identify a favorable opponent among K\u22121.\n",

Later-round tallies t_w(S) can substantially exceed p_w after transfers. Counterexample sketch (K=4): Let p=(0.26,0.26,0.23,0.25) for (a,b,c,y). Suppose after removing a the tallies on S={b,c,y} are (t_b,t_c,t_y)=(0.40,0.25,0.35). A two-type bound computed only from p would take A*\u22480.03 and B*\u22480.01, which does not keep c,y above b in S: c would still be the round-2 loser. Any sound certificate must use the relevant subset tallies t_w(S).\n\n- Dual sensitivity (fixed-order LP): prior attempts to bound sup_{\u03bb} ||\u03bb||_1 by K or K\u22121 dropped the negative term at j=pos_\u03c0(x) in the dual constraints. Including it makes the \u2018sum over x\u2019 argument cancel, giving no bound. The sensitivity constant remains open.\n\n- Sound general-K two-type (chain) certificate. For target c and pivot b, let S_1=C and iteratively remove e_j = argmin_{e\u2208S_j\\{b,c}} t_e(S_j), with the same deterministic tie-breaking as the election, forming S_{j+1}=S_j\\{e_j}. Define\n  A_b(\u03b3)=max_j [t_{e_j}(S_j)\u2212t_c(S_j)+\u03b3]_+,\n  B_b(\u03b3)=max_j [t_{e_j}(S_j)\u2212t_b(S_j)+\u03b3]_+,\n  D_{b,c}(\u03b3)=t_b({b,c})\u2212t_c({b,c})+\u03b3.\nAdding \u03b1\u2265A_b(\u03b3) of c-first and \u03b2\u2265B_b(\u03b3) of b-first ballots ensures elimination of e_1,\u2026,e_{K\u22122} in order and a strict c-over-b final if \u03b1\u2212\u03b2\u2265D_{b,c}(\u03b3). The minimal two-type mass is B_b+max{A_b, B_b+D_{b,c}}. This is a sufficient, efficiently checkable condition depending on O(K) subset tallies (those on the chain sets S_j and the final pair).\n\n- K=3 exact formula. The minimal augmentation to make c win is \u03b5^*(\u03b3;c)=min{\u03b5_a^*(\u03b3), \u03b5_b^*(\u03b3)}, where for first-eliminate a: A_\u03b3=[p_a\u2212p_c+\u03b3]_+, B_\u03b3=[p_a\u2212p_b+\u03b3]_+, D_\u03b3=t_b({b,c})\u2212t_c({b,c})+\u03b3, and \u03b5_a^*(\u03b3)=B_\u03b3+max{A_\u03b3, B_\u03b3+D_\u03b3}. This matches the earlier counterexample and strictly improves the c-first certificate. A safe plug-in Lipschitz constant is 6 under sup-norm perturbations of the five required tallies.\n\nNext steps\n- Formalize the chain-based certificate (statement and proof) and add it to proofs.md; keep the K=3 exact theorem and the c-first certificate with sampling.\n- Construct a K\u22654 instance where adding a third ballot type strictly reduces the required mass relative to the two-type bound.\n- Pursue a correct dual-norm bound for the fixed-order LP (retain negative contributions); explore alternative dual test rankings or decompositions by rounds.\n- Lower bounds: formalize a Fano/packing family showing \u03a9((log K)/\u03b5^2) for identifying a favorable opponent y among K\u22121 possibilities.\n"

For each S with c\u2208S, t'_c(S)=t_c(S)+\u03b5' > min_{a\u2260c} t_a(S), so c is never the unique minimum in any round and thus survives to win.\n\nCorollary 3 (Sampling for the c-first certificate).\nLet \\hat M_c be the plug-in estimator of M_c from \\hat t.

Then \u03b5_a^*(\u03b3)=B_\u03b3+max{A_\u03b3, B_\u03b3+D_\u03b3}. Symmetrically, \u03b5_b^*(\u03b3)=B'_\u03b3+max{A'_\u03b3, B'_\u03b3+D'_\u03b3} with a\u2194b. The exact minimal augmentation is \u03b5^*(\u03b3;c)=min{\u03b5_a^*(\u03b3), \u03b5_b^*(\u03b3)}, and \u03b5^*(c)=lim_{\u03b3\u21920^+} \u03b5^*(\u03b3;c).\n\nProof. Sufficiency: adding \u03b1 c-first and \u03b2 b-first changes p'_a=p_a, p'_b=p_b+\u03b2, p'_c=p_c+\u03b1, so a is strictly below both b and c in round 1 if \u03b1\u2265A_\u03b3 and \u03b2\u2265B_\u03b3. In the final, t'_c({b,c})\u2212t'_b({b,c})=(t_c\u2212t_b)+\u03b1\u2212\u03b2, so \u03b1\u2212\u03b2\u2265D_\u03b3 ensures a strict c-over-b win. Optimality over two types reduces to minimizing \u03b1+\u03b2 over \u03b1\u2265A_\u03b3, \u03b2\u2265B_\u03b3, \u03b1\u2212\u03b2\u2265D_\u03b3, whose solution is \u03b2=B_\u03b3 and \u03b1=max{A_\u03b3, B_\u03b3+D_\u03b3}. Taking the better of eliminating a or b first yields \u03b5^*(\u03b3;c).\n\nTheorem 6 (General K chain-based two-type certificate).\nFix c\u2208C and choose a pivot b\u2208C\\{c}. Set S_1:=C. For j=1,\u2026,K\u22122, let e_j be the (tie-broken) minimizer of t_e(S_j) over e\u2208S_j\\{b,c}, and define S_{j+1}:=S_j\\{e_j}. Let\nA_b(\u03b3):=max_{1\u2264j\u2264K\u22122} [t_{e_j}(S_j)\u2212t_c(S_j)+\u03b3]_+,\nB_b(\u03b3):=max_{1\u2264j\u2264K\u22122} [t_{e_j}(S_j)\u2212t_b(S_j)+\u03b3]_+,\nD_{b,c}(\u03b3):=t_b({b,c})\u2212t_c({b,c})+\u03b3.\nIf we add \u03b1\u22650 of c-first ballots and \u03b2\u22650 of b-first ballots with \u03b1\u2265A_b(\u03b3), \u03b2\u2265B_b(\u03b3), and \u03b1\u2212\u03b2\u2265D_{b,c}(\u03b3), then the IRV elimination proceeds by removing e_1,\u2026,e_{K\u22122} (in order) before {b,c}, and c defeats b in the final by \u2265\u03b3. Among such two-type additions, the minimum total mass is\n\u03b5_b^*(\u03b3)=B_b(\u03b3)+max{A_b(\u03b3), B_b(\u03b3)+D_{b,c}(\u03b3)}.\n\nProof. Induct on j. For S_j, by construction e_j is the minimal among S_j\\{b,c}. Since only c and b tallies increase, all other candidates remain at baseline and e_j remains the (tie-broken) minimum among S_j\\{b,c}. The constraints \u03b1\u2265A_b(\u03b3), \u03b2\u2265B_b(\u03b3) imply t'_c(S_j)>t'_{e_j}(S_j) and t'_b(S_j)>t'_{e_j}(S_j), so e_j is the unique minimum in S_j and is eliminated. This yields S_{j+1}. In the final between b and c, each c-first (resp. b-first) ballot adds +1 to t'_c({b,c}) (resp. t'_b({b,c})), so \u03b1\u2212\u03b2\u2265D_{b,c}(\u03b3) ensures a strict c-over-b win. Minimizing \u03b1+\u03b2 over the three halfspaces gives \u03b2=B_b(\u03b3) and \u03b1=max{A_b(\u03b3), B_b(\u03b3)+D_{b,c}(\u03b3)}.\n\nCorollary 7 (K=3 sampling for exact \u03b5^*).\nEstimating the five quantities {p_a,p_b,p_c,t_c({b,c}),t_c({a,c})} within \u03c4 by m=\u0398((log(1/\u03b4))/\u03c4^2) samples and using a safety margin 6\u03c4 yields a correct plug-in decision with probability \u22651\u2212\u03b4.
