We confirmed and formalized: (1) a sound c-first sufficient certificate with uniform-convergence sampling; (2) an exact K=3 two-type formula with sampling guarantee; and (3) a sound general-K chain-based two-type certificate (fix pivot b and follow the minimal-of-others chain). We rejected: Prover 1’s general-K two-type result based solely on first-round shares (invalid), and Provers 2–3’s dual 1-norm bounds (omit negative terms) and K=3 Lipschitz L=3 (too small). Main open item: a correct polynomial dual sensitivity bound for the fixed-order LP; plus tighter K-dependent lower bounds. We updated proofs with the validated theorems and output with concise upper/lower bounds and the K=3 exact result.
