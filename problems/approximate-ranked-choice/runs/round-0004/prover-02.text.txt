Ideas
- Prove a general-K “chain-based two-type” sufficient certificate formally, including a clean dominance/cleanup argument and the exact minimizer α+β = B + max{A, B + D} for that chain. Why useful: gives an efficiently checkable sufficient condition using O(K) subset tallies and matches the K=3 exact formula when K=3.
- Provide a sampling theorem for the chain-certificate under a verifiable chain-stability margin condition, using only O(K^2) quantities and Hoeffding bounds.
- Record a special-case exactness result for K ≥ 4 under a strong “monotone minimality” hypothesis along the chain.
- Avoid the incorrect fixed-order dual-norm bound; instead, state a concrete obstruction and outline directions for bounding the dual norm or using repair arguments in restricted settings.

Theorem A (Chain-based two-type sufficient certificate; general K).
Fix target c and pivot b ≠ c. Let S_1 := C and, for j = 1,…,K−2, define e_j := argmin_{e∈S_j\{b,c}} t_e(S_j) with the election’s deterministic tie-breaking, and S_{j+1} := S_j\{e_j}. Define
A_b(γ) := max_{1≤j≤K−2} [t_{e_j}(S_j) − t_c(S_j) + γ]_+,
B_b(γ) := max_{1≤j≤K−2} [t_{e_j}(S_j) − t_b(S_j) + γ]_+,
D_{b,c}(γ) := t_b({b,c}) − t_c({b,c}) + γ.
If we add α ≥ 0 c-first and β ≥ 0 b-first ballots with
α ≥ A_b(γ), β ≥ B_b(γ), α − β ≥ D_{b,c}(γ),
then the IRV process eliminates e_1,…,e_{K−2} in order, followed by a strict c-over-b final; hence c wins. Moreover, among augmentations restricted to only these two types, the minimal mass is ε_spine(b;γ) = B_b(γ) + max{A_b(γ), B_b(γ) + D_{b,c}(γ)}.

Proof.
Effect of c-first and b-first on tallies: For any S containing c (resp. b), adding α c-first (resp. β b-first) increases t_c(S) (resp. t_b(S)) by α (resp. β) and leaves all other t_x(S) unchanged. In particular, for each j, t'_{e_j}(S_j) = t_{e_j}(S_j), t'_c(S_j) = t_c(S_j) + α, and t'_b(S_j) = t_b(S_j) + β.
- Chain eliminations: For each j and x ∈ S_j\{e_j}, baseline has t_{e_j}(S_j) ≤ t_x(S_j). For x ∈ S_j\{b,c}, both sides are unchanged by the augmentation, preserving strict inequalities once we enforce slack γ. For x = b,c, the constraints α ≥ A_b(γ) and β ≥ B_b(γ) ensure t'_{e_j}(S_j) ≤ min{t'_b(S_j), t'_c(S_j)} − γ. Hence, e_j remains the unique minimum of S_j and is eliminated (the strict margin removes tie-breaking dependence). Inductively, the chain S_1 ⊋ S_2 ⊋ ⋯ ⊋ S_{K−1} is realized.
- Final: In S_{K−1} = {b,c}, each added c-first (resp. b-first) ballot contributes +1 to t'_c − t'_b (resp. −1). The condition α − β ≥ D_{b,c}(γ) ensures t'_c({b,c}) ≥ t'_b({b,c}) + γ, so c defeats b strictly.
- Optimality with two types: The feasible region for (α,β) is 
{(α,β) ∈ R_+^2 : α ≥ A_b(γ), β ≥ B_b(γ), α − β ≥ D_{b,c}(γ)}.
Minimizing α+β over this polyhedron is attained at β = B_b(γ), α = max{A_b(γ), B_b(γ) + D_{b,c}(γ)}, giving ε_spine(b;γ).

Cleanup lemma (dominance of two-type ballots for this chain).
Let y be any feasible augmentation realizing the chain e_1,…,e_{K−2} and a c-over-b final with strict slack γ. Then there exists another augmentation y′ of no larger mass supported only on c-first and b-first ballots that also realizes the chain and the final.

Proof.
Partition ballots r by their top among each S_j. If for some j, top_{S_j}(r) = e_j, then r increases t_{e_j}(S_j), pushing against feasibility; deleting such mass can only help the chain constraints. Let r be any remaining ballot. Its contribution to the final margin depends only on top_{\{b,c\}}(r). Replace r by an equal mass of c-first ballots if top_{\{b,c\}}(r) = c and b-first ballots if it equals b. For every S_j, the replacement affects t_b(S_j) and t_c(S_j) exactly as r does or improves them (since c-first raises only t_c and b-first raises only t_b, never raising any t_{e_j}); thus the chain constraints are preserved or slackened. The final margin is preserved by construction. Iterating over r yields a two-type augmentation with no larger total mass.

Corollary A1 (K=3 exactness as a special case).
When K = 3 and b is the sole opponent besides c, the chain has one element (the unique e_1), and ε_spine(b;γ) equals
B_γ + max{A_γ, B_γ + D_γ}, with A_γ = [p_a − p_c + γ]_+, B_γ = [p_a − p_b + γ]_+, D_γ = t_b({b,c}) − t_c({b,c}) + γ, reproducing the exact formula ε^*(γ;c) = min_b ε_spine(b;γ) and ε^*(c) = lim_{γ→0^+} ε^*(γ;c).

Theorem B (Sampling for the chain certificate under stability).
Fix b and γ > 0. Let the true chain be S_1^*,…,S_{K−1}^* with minima e_j^*. Define the empirical chain \hat S_1,…,\hat S_{K−1} with minima \hat e_j by replacing t with \hat t (ties broken by the same rule). Let the empirical gaps
\hat g_j := min_{x∈\hat S_j\{\hat e_j}} \hat t_x(\hat S_j) − \hat t_{\hat e_j}(\hat S_j).
Suppose m samples yield sup-norm error ≤ τ simultaneously for all quantities \hat t_x(S) that we evaluate below. If \hat g_j ≥ 4τ for all j, then S_j^* = \hat S_j and e_j^* = \hat e_j for all j. Moreover, setting
\hat A_b(γ) := max_j [\hat t_{\hat e_j}(\hat S_j) − \hat t_c(\hat S_j) + γ]_+,
\hat B_b(γ) := max_j [\hat t_{\hat e_j}(\hat S_j) − \hat t_b(\hat S_j) + γ]_+,
\hat D_{b,c}(γ) := \hat t_b({b,c}) − \hat t_c({b,c}) + γ,
and choosing α = \hat A_b(γ) + 2τ, β = \hat B_b(γ) + 2τ, and enforcing α − β ≥ \hat D_{b,c}(γ) + 2τ, we have that (α,β) satisfies the true chain constraints with slack ≥ γ (and a final margin ≥ γ) with probability ≥ 1 − δ. Consequently, if \hat ε_spine(b;γ) := \hat B_b(γ) + max{\hat A_b(γ), \hat B_b(γ) + \hat D_{b,c}(γ)} ≤ ε − 4τ, the decision “c is an ε-winner via b” is correct with probability at least 1 − δ.

Proof.
- Chain stability: If sup error ≤ τ, then for each j the true minimal satisfies t_{e_j^*}(S_j^*) ≤ \hat t_{e_j^*}(\hat S_j) + τ ≤ \hat t_{\hat e_j}(\hat S_j) + τ, while any x ∈ \hat S_j\{\hat e_j} has t_x(S_j^*) ≥ \hat t_x(\hat S_j) − τ ≥ \hat t_{\hat e_j}(\hat S_j) + (\hat g_j − τ) ≥ \hat t_{\hat e_j}(\hat S_j) + 3τ. Hence t_{e_j^*}(S_j^*) < t_x(S_j^*) for all x ≠ e_j^*, forcing e_j^* = \hat e_j and S_j^* = \hat S_j by induction on j.
- Feasibility margin: For each j,
[t_{e_j^*}(S_j^*) − t_c(S_j^*)] − [\hat t_{\hat e_j}(\hat S_j) − \hat t_c(\hat S_j)] ≤ 2τ,
[t_{e_j^*}(S_j^*) − t_b(S_j^*)] − [\hat t_{\hat e_j}(\hat S_j) − \hat t_b(\hat S_j)] ≤ 2τ,
and [t_b({b,c}) − t_c({b,c})] − [\hat t_b({b,c}) − \hat t_c({b,c})] ≤ 2τ. Therefore, adding 2τ to \hat A_b, \hat B_b, and \hat D_{b,c} ensures the true constraints hold with slack γ. Minimizing α+β at the empirical level and adding 2τ to each of α,β yields a sound certificate margin 4τ.
- Sample size: We evaluate O(K^2) tallies: for each j, \hat t_x(\hat S_j) for x ∈ \hat S_j, and the final pair {b,c}. Hoeffding plus a union bound gives m = Θ((log(K) + log(1/δ))/τ^2).

Remark.
The stability condition \hat g_j ≥ 4τ is checkable from data; when it holds, we avoid exponential union bounds. If it fails, we can fall back to the distribution-free c-first certificate or to evaluating a small menu of alternative pivots b.

Theorem C (Exactness under monotone minimality; special case for K ≥ 4).
Fix b and assume the chain e_1,…,e_{K−2} satisfies a uniform gap condition: for each j and each x ∈ S_j\{b,c,e_j}, t_x(S_j) ≥ t_{e_j}(S_j) + θ for some θ > 0. Then for any α,β ≥ 0, the identities of the minima in S_j remain e_j (i.e., minimality is monotone under α c-first and β b-first additions). Consequently, among all augmentations that realize this same elimination order and a c-over-b final with slack γ, the minimal mass equals ε_spine(b;γ).

Proof.
The gap condition freezes the minima among candidates other than {b,c}; adding α,β only raises t_b and t_c, so the unique minimal in S_j remains e_j regardless of α,β. By the cleanup lemma, any augmentation realizing this order can be replaced by a two-type augmentation of no larger mass. The two-type minimization was solved explicitly in Theorem A, yielding optimal mass ε_spine(b;γ).

Obstacles and clarifications
- Fixed-order LP dual sensitivity: Previous attempts (including ours) to bound sup_{λ∈Λ} ||λ||_1 by O(K) erroneously dropped the negative contributions at j = pos_π(x) in the dual constraints. Keeping them shows that summing “champion” constraints cancels, giving no nontrivial bound. Bounding sup ||λ||_1 remains open. Two avenues: (i) construct round-wise test rankings that upper bound ||λ||_1 via a packing argument over constraints; (ii) primal “repair” schemes under strict feasibility margins for v(b), yielding local Lipschitzness without global dual bounds.
- Two-type suboptimality for K ≥ 4 (global optimum): While Theorem A is sufficient (and exact in special cases), we expect instances where the global minimal augmentation uses ≥ 3 ballot types to steer the process into a cheaper elimination path not aligned with any pivot-b chain. Constructing such an explicit coherent example (consistent across all S) is left open.

Examples (sketchable checks)
- K = 3: The counterexample in the notes (a=0.38, b=0.35, c=0.27; c beats b by 0.10, loses to a by 0.20) yields A_0=0.11, B_0=0.03, D_0=−0.10, and ε_a^*(0) = 0.03 + max{0.11, −0.07} = 0.14 < the c-first 0.20; this is captured by Theorem A with K=3.
- Chain-stability diagnostic: In synthetic data, if empirical minima gaps along the chain exceed, say, 5τ, the identities of e_j stabilize; plugging empirical A,B,D with a 4τ margin yields a valid certificate at sample size m ≈ c (log K + log(1/δ)) / τ^2.

Next steps
- Add Theorem A (full statement, proof, cleanup lemma) and Theorem B (sampling under chain-stability) to proofs.md; a concise statement of ε_spine(b;γ) and its K=3 specialization goes to output.md.
- Attempt to build a K=4 coherent counterexample where two-type certificates are loose by solving the fixed-order LP numerically and inspecting optimal supports.
- Explore local sensitivity of v(b) at strictly feasible b via primal repair: quantify additional mass needed to restore γ-slack after a perturbation of size τ in t_a(S_j) − t_{π(j)}(S_j).
- Lower bounds: Formalize a Fano/packing family parameterized by the favorable pivot b ∈ C\{c}, with pairwise perturbations of magnitude Θ(ε) and KL distances O(ε^2), to show Ω((log K)/ε^2) samples are necessary to reliably identify a pivot leading to an ε-winner.
- Data-driven hybrid certifier: compute (i) c-first certificate, (ii) K=3 exact ε^* for each triple {b,c,x}, (iii) chain-based ε_spine(b;γ) for pivots b passing the stability test; output the smallest. Prove a unified sampling guarantee via union bounds over O(K^2) quantities and data-dependent margins.

Minor note on constants (K=3 plug-in): The map (p_a,p_b,p_c,t_c({b,c}),t_c({a,c})) ↦ ε^*(γ;c) is 6-Lipschitz under sup-norm perturbations. Choosing τ = ε/12 yields m = Θ((log(1/δ))/ε^2) for a safe plug-in decision with margin 2Lτ = ε.
