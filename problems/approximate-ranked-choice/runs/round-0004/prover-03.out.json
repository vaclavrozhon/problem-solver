This provides a sound, efficiently checkable sufficient condition using only O(K^2) tallies from the chain sets S_j and the final pair.\n- Give a clean sampling corollary: Hoeffding + union bound over O(K^2) tallies; plug-in stability with a safe Lipschitz constant 6 for the cost map, yielding m = \u0398((log K + log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2) to certify using the chain certificate.\n- Record corrections: (i) the fixed-order LP dual sensitivity sup||\u03bb||_1 remains open; previous attempted bounds (\u2264K or \u2264K\u22121) were invalid due to the negative terms, (ii) for K=3 the safe Lipschitz constant is L \u2264 6 (not 3).\n\nGeneral-K chain-based two-type certificate (precise statement and proof)\nSetup. Let C be the candidate set, |C| = K \u2265 3. For any nonempty S \u2286 C and a \u2208 S, let t_a(S) = Pr[top among S is a] under the baseline population distribution P over full rankings. Fix a target c \u2208 C and a pivot b \u2208 C \\ {c}. Fix a deterministic tie-breaking rule and a slack \u03b3 > 0 to enforce strict separations.\n\nDefine a chain of remaining sets by S_1 := C, and for j = 1,\u2026,K\u22122:\n- Let e_j \u2208 argmin_{e \u2208 S_j \\ {b,c}} t_e(S_j), with ties broken by the election\u2019s tie-breaking rule; set S_{j+1} := S_j \\ {e_j}.\nIntuition: e_j is the \u201cbaseline round-j loser among non-{b,c}\u201d on S_j.\n\nDefine the thresholds\n- A_b(\u03b3) := max_{1 \u2264 j \u2264 K\u22122} [ t_{e_j}(S_j) \u2212 t_c(S_j) + \u03b3 ]_+,\n- B_b(\u03b3) := max_{1 \u2264 j \u2264 K\u22122} [ t_{e_j}(S_j) \u2212 t_b(S_j) + \u03b3 ]_+,\n- D_{b,c}(\u03b3) := t_b({b,c}) \u2212 t_c({b,c}) + \u03b3.\n\nConsider augmentations that add only two ballot types: \u03b1 \u2265 0 mass of c-first rankings and \u03b2 \u2265 0 mass of b-first rankings (the completions below the top are arbitrary but fixed). Let \u03b5_b^{chain}(\u03b3) be the minimal \u03b1+\u03b2 that ensures the following IRV outcome under the augmented profile: the election eliminates e_1,\u2026,e_{K\u22122} in this order and the final is c vs b with c strictly beating b by margin \u2265 \u03b3.\n\nTheorem (chain-based two-type certificate and exact two-type optimum). For any fixed b \u2260 c and \u03b3 > 0:\n1) Feasibility: If \u03b1 \u2265 A_b(\u03b3), \u03b2 \u2265 B_b(\u03b3), and \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2265 D_{b,c}(\u03b3), then under the augmented profile, in round j the candidate e_j is eliminated (with strict margin to both b and c), and in the final c strictly beats b; consequently c wins. Hence any \u03b5 \u2265 B_b(\u03b3) + max{A_b(\u03b3), B_b(\u03b3) + D_{b,c}(\u03b3)} suffices to make c the winner via two-type additions.\n2) Optimality within two types: Among augmentations using only c-first and b-first ballots, the minimal total mass achieving the above outcome equals\n   \u03b5_b^{chain}(\u03b3) = B_b(\u03b3) + max{A_b(\u03b3), B_b(\u03b3) + D_{b,c}(\u03b3)}.\n\nProof.\nEffect of two types. A c-first ballot contributes +1 to t_c(S) for every S with c \u2208 S, and leaves t_a(S) unchanged for a \u2260 c. A b-first ballot symmetrically contributes +1 to t_b(S) for S containing b and leaves others unchanged. In particular, for every j \u2264 K\u22122 (so S_j contains both b and c), we have\n  t'_c(S_j) = t_c(S_j) + \u03b1,  t'_b(S_j) = t_b(S_j) + \u03b2, and t'_{e_j}(S_j) = t_{e_j}(S_j).\nMoreover, in the final S = {b,c}, t'_c(S) \u2212 t'_b(S) = (t_c(S) \u2212 t_b(S)) + (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2).\n\nFeasibility. By the definitions of A_b and B_b,\n  \u03b1 \u2265 A_b(\u03b3) \u21d2 t'_c(S_j) \u2265 t_{e_j}(S_j) + \u03b3 for all j,\n  \u03b2 \u2265 B_b(\u03b3) \u21d2 t'_b(S_j) \u2265 t_{e_j}(S_j) + \u03b3 for all j.\nTherefore at each round j, e_j is (weakly) below all other candidates in S_j, and strictly below both b and c. Since the other candidates\u2019 tallies in S_j are unchanged and e_j was chosen as the argmin among S_j \\ {b,c} (with the same tie-breaking), e_j is the unique eliminated (ties, if any among S_j \\ {b,c}, resolve the same way as at baseline; strict gaps to b and c ensure e_j is still the minimum). After eliminating e_1,\u2026,e_{K\u22122}, the final is between b and c. If in addition \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2265 D_{b,c}(\u03b3), then t'_c({b,c}) \u2265 t'_b({b,c}) + \u03b3, so c strictly wins the final. Hence the stated inequalities are sufficient and the total mass \u03b1+\u03b2 at any feasible point is an upper bound on \u03b5.\n\nOptimal two-type cost. The feasible region in (\u03b1,\u03b2)-space is\n  { (\u03b1,\u03b2) \u2208 R_+^2 : \u03b1 \u2265 A_b(\u03b3), \u03b2 \u2265 B_b(\u03b3), \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2265 D_{b,c}(\u03b3) }.\nThis is a convex polyhedron. Minimizing \u03b1+\u03b2 over it is achieved by taking \u03b2 = B_b(\u03b3) and \u03b1 = max{A_b(\u03b3), B_b(\u03b3) + D_{b,c}(\u03b3)} (any larger \u03b2 enlarges \u03b1+\u03b2; any \u03b1 below A_b violates feasibility; if A_b \u2264 B_b + D then the \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 constraint is tight, otherwise \u03b1 = A_b). Thus \u03b5_b^{chain}(\u03b3) equals the claimed expression. \u220e\n\nRemarks.\n- This certificate depends only on the tallies t_x(S_j) for the chain sets S_j (j = 1,\u2026,K\u22122) and the pairwise tallies on {b,c}. Computing the chain e_1,\u2026,e_{K\u22122} uses the same deterministic tie-breaking as the election profile.\n- Dominance: For this targeted chain and final, any added ballot not topping b or c in S_j weakly worsens feasibility constraints at round j (it cannot lower t_{e_j}(S_j) and does not increase t_b(S_j) or t_c(S_j)), hence it is never needed in an optimal two-type plan for this chain.\n\nSampling corollary for the chain-based certificate\nDefine, for fixed c and b, the cost map\n  \u03a6_b(P; \u03b3) := B_b(\u03b3) + max{A_b(\u03b3), B_b(\u03b3) + D_{b,c}(\u03b3)}.\nLet \ud835\udcaf_b be the multiset of tallies comprising, for j = 1,\u2026,K\u22122, the triple (t_{e_j}(S_j), t_b(S_j), t_c(S_j)) and the pairwise (t_b({b,c}), t_c({b,c})). Note e_j depends on S_j\u2019s full tally vector and the fixed tie-breaker; in sampling we compute e_j from estimates (and enforce a safety slack \u03b3).\n\nLemma (uniform estimation over the chain tallies). For m i.i.d. ballots and any \u03c4 > 0, with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4, we have\n  sup_{x \u2208 \ud835\udcaf_b} |\\hat t_x \u2212 t_x| \u2264 \u03c4\nwhenever m \u2265 c \u00b7 (log(2|\ud835\udcaf_b|/\u03b4))/\u03c4^2 for a universal constant c. Here |\ud835\udcaf_b| \u2264 3(K\u22122) + 2 = O(K).\n\nProof. Hoeffding\u2019s inequality for each tally and a union bound over |\ud835\udcaf_b|.\n\nProposition (plug-in stability and sample complexity). The map \u03a6_b(\u00b7; \u03b3) is Lipschitz with constant at most 6 in the sup norm over the entries of \ud835\udcaf_b: for any two profiles P, Q,\n  |\u03a6_b(P; \u03b3) \u2212 \u03a6_b(Q; \u03b3)| \u2264 6 \u00b7 sup_{x \u2208 \ud835\udcaf_b} |t_x^P \u2212 t_x^Q|.\nConsequently, if m \u2265 c (log(2|\ud835\udcaf_b|/\u03b4))/\u03c4^2 and we declare c a certified \u03b5-winner via pivot b whenever \\hat \u03a6_b \u2264 \u03b5 \u2212 6\u03c4, then with probability \u2265 1 \u2212 \u03b4 the declaration is sound (c is an \u03b5-winner).\n\nProof. Each difference t_{e_j}(S_j) \u2212 t_c(S_j) and t_{e_j}(S_j) \u2212 t_b(S_j) perturbs by at most 2\u03c4 under sup-norm \u03c4 perturbations of the inputs; taking positive part and a maximum over j preserves 2-Lipschitzness, so A_b and B_b are each 2-Lipschitz. The pairwise gap D_{b,c} is also 2-Lipschitz. The map (B, A, D) \u21a6 B + max{A, B + D} has Lipschitz constant \u2264 1 + max{1, 1 + 1} = 3 with respect to sup norm on (A, B, D). Composing gives \u2264 3\u00b72 = 6 overall. The acceptance margin then follows.\n\nCorollary (choosing the pivot b). Since there are K \u2212 1 choices of b \u2260 c, a union bound adds only log(K) to the sample complexity. Declare c certified if min_{b\u2260c} \\hat \u03a6_b \u2264 \u03b5 \u2212 6\u03c4; with m \u2265 c (log(2K|\ud835\udcaf_b|/\u03b4))/\u03c4^2 and \u03c4 = \u0398(\u03b5), this certifies c with probability \u2265 1 \u2212 \u03b4 whenever min_b \u03a6_b \u2264 \u03b5.\n\nConnections and consistency checks\n- K = 3: The chain has a single j (K\u22122 = 1) and recovers exactly the two-type closed form previously established: \u03b5^*(\u03b3; c) = min_{b\u2260c} \u03a6_b(P; \u03b3). The safe plug-in Lipschitz constant is 6.\n- Soundness vs. first-round-only claims: The chain certificate crucially uses t_x(S_j) on the actual S_j; replacing these by first-round shares p_x can be arbitrarily wrong (see the verifier\u2019s K=4 counterexample where post-transfer t_b(S) = 0.40 far exceeds p_b).\n\nObstacles (LP dual sensitivity remains open)\n- For a fixed elimination order \u03c0, the primal LP and its dual are correct as recorded in the notes. The dual constraint for a ranking r includes negative terms \u2212\u2211_{a} \u03bb_{j,a} when top_{S_j}(r) = \u03c0(j). Attempting to bound sup||\u03bb||_1 by summing constraints over special r that place a fixed candidate first fails: the negative block at j = pos_\u03c0(\u00b7) cancels when one sums over candidates, yielding no nontrivial bound. Any future bound must leverage constraints for families of rankings r where the negative blocks are controlled jointly rather than na\u00efvely dropped.\n\nExamples (sanity check instance for the chain certificate)\nConstruct K=4 with C={a,b,c,d}, target c, pivot b. Suppose\n- First round: t({a,b,c,d}) = (0.33, 0.30, 0.27, 0.10).\n- After removing d: t({a,b,c}) = (0.41, 0.31, 0.28).\n- Final pair: t_c({b,c}) \u2212 t_b({b,c}) = 0.02.\nChain (excluding {b,c}): S_1={a,b,c,d}, e_1=d; S_2={a,b,c}, e_2=a. Then\n  A_b(0) = max{ [0.10\u22120.27]_+, [0.41\u22120.28]_+ } = 0.13,\n  B_b(0) = max{ [0.10\u22120.30]_+, [0.41\u22120.31]_+ } = 0.10,\n  D_{b,c}(0) = \u22120.02.\nThus \u03a6_b(P; 0) = 0.10 + max{0.13, 0.08} = 0.23. Adding \u03b1=0.13 of c-first and \u03b2=0.10 of b-first ballots ensures elimination of d then a and a c-over-b final, for total mass 0.23. This illustrates how the chain-based certificate exploits the relevant S_j tallies beyond first-round shares.\n\nNext steps\n- Add the chain-based certificate theorem and sampling corollary (with L \u2264 6) to proofs.md and output.md. Keep the K=3 exact minimal-augmentation result and its sampling bound.\n- Computational search for separations: formulate a bilevel program that (i) chooses a small-support ranking distribution P (over, say, \u226410 ranking types) to maximize the gap between true minimal augmentation and min_b \u03a6_b(P; 0), and (ii) searches over augmentations with 2 vs. 3 types. This can produce concrete K\u22654 instances where a third ballot type strictly reduces the required mass vs. any pivot-b two-type plan.\n- Dual sensitivity: explore averaging arguments over carefully chosen families of rankings that keep the negative dual terms bounded in aggregate, potentially yielding order-dependent bounds sup||\u03bb||_1 = poly(K) (e.g., O(K^2)). Any such bound would convert per-order LP certification into a polynomial-sample scheme.\n- Lower bounds: pursue a Fano-style packing over pivots b (hiding the favorable opponent among K\u22121) to show a necessary \u03a9((log K)/\u03b5^2) factor for certifying an \u03b5-winner in the worst case.\n"
