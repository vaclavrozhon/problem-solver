  "content": "# Ideas\n\n- Prove a general necessary lower bound that depends only on round\u20111 (S=C) deficits and the final c vs b head\u2011to\u2011head margin. Why useful: it cleanly separates the unavoidable first\u2011round survival cost from any path-specific requirements and matches the exact K=3 cost; it also lower-bounds any chain-based certificate for K\u22654.\n- Give a precise two-stage sampling guarantee for the chain-based (pivot-b) certificate under a simple separation condition and with sample-splitting. Why useful: yields a polynomial-in-K, distribution-dependent (via the separation) sample bound with a crisp proof.\n- Sharpen the counting for the c-first certificate\u2019s uniform convergence (reduce the function-class cardinality factor). Why useful: slightly improves constants and clarifies what must be estimated when certifying a fixed c.\n\n# A necessary lower bound for any augmentation achieving the final pair {b,c}\n\nNotation. For S=C and any x, write p_x := t_x(C). Let p_min^{(b,c)} := min_{x\u2208C\\{b,c}} p_x. Fix \u03b3>0 for strictness and D_{b,c}(\u03b3) := t_b({b,c}) \u2212 t_c({b,c}) + \u03b3. Define the round\u20111 deficits\n- A^{(1)}_b(\u03b3) := [ p_min^{(b,c)} \u2212 p_c + \u03b3 ]_+,\n- B^{(1)}_b(\u03b3) := [ p_min^{(b,c)} \u2212 p_b + \u03b3 ]_+.\n\nTheorem (Round\u20111 + final lower bound). Fix c and b\u2260c. Let y be any nonnegative measure on rankings added to the baseline profile such that IRV (with the fixed tie\u2011breaking) produces a final between {b,c} and c strictly beats b in that final by margin \u2265\u03b3. Then the total mass \u2225y\u2225_1 satisfies\n  \u2225y\u2225_1 \u2265 L_b(\u03b3) := B^{(1)}_b(\u03b3) + max{ A^{(1)}_b(\u03b3), B^{(1)}_b(\u03b3) + D_{b,c}(\u03b3) }.\nMoreover, equality is attained for K=3.\n\nProof. Partition y into y_c (top_C = c), y_b (top_C = b), and y_rest; write \u03b1=\u2225y_c\u2225_1, \u03b2=\u2225y_b\u2225_1, and \u03d1=\u2225y_rest\u2225_1. To ensure neither c nor b is eliminated in round 1, we must have\n  p_c + \u03b1 \u2265 p_min^{(b,c)} + \u03b3 and p_b + \u03b2 \u2265 p_min^{(b,c)} + \u03b3,\nwhich are necessary, so \u03b1 \u2265 A^{(1)}_b(\u03b3), \u03b2 \u2265 B^{(1)}_b(\u03b3). In the final {b,c}, the updated margin is\n  (t_c({b,c}) \u2212 t_b({b,c})) + (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2) + (\u03b8_c \u2212 \u03b8_b),\nwhere \u03b8_c (resp., \u03b8_b) is the contribution of y_rest to c (resp., b) in the pair {b,c}. Since \u03b8_c \u2212 \u03b8_b \u2264 \u03d1, the strict win by \u2265\u03b3 implies \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 + \u03d1 \u2265 D_{b,c}(\u03b3). Minimizing \u03b1+\u03b2+\u03d1 subject to \u03b1 \u2265 A, \u03b2 \u2265 B, \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 + \u03d1 \u2265 D is a 2D polyhedral problem with optimum B + max{A, B + D}, achieved at \u03b2 = B and \u03b1 = max{A, B + D \u2212 \u03d1} with \u03d1 chosen to meet the final constraint tightly. Substituting A=A^{(1)}_b(\u03b3), B=B^{(1)}_b(\u03b3), D=D_{b,c}(\u03b3) proves the bound. For K=3, later rounds impose no additional constraints beyond round 1 and the final, and the standard two\u2011type construction (c\u2011first and b\u2011first) or its variant using y_rest to assist the final achieves equality.\n\nCorollary (Consistency with K=3 exact formula). For K=3 and fixed b, L_b(\u03b3) equals the exact minimal augmentation for the strategy \u201celiminate the third candidate first and then elect c over b,\u201d hence \u03b5^*(\u03b3;c) = min_{b\u2260c} L_b(\u03b3).\n\nCorollary (Lower bound against any chain-based certificate). For K\u22654 and any pivot b, the chain\u2011based two\u2011type certificate cost \u03b5_b^*(\u03b3) = B_b(\u03b3) + max{A_b(\u03b3), B_b(\u03b3) + D_{b,c}(\u03b3)} satisfies \u03b5_b^*(\u03b3) \u2265 L_b(\u03b3) because A_b(\u03b3) \u2265 A^{(1)}_b(\u03b3) and B_b(\u03b3) \u2265 B^{(1)}_b(\u03b3) by definition (the chain includes S_1=C). Thus L_b(\u03b3) is a universal benchmark; any strict gap \u03b5_b^*(\u03b3) \u2212 L_b(\u03b3) quantifies room for improvement via path changes (potentially requiring additional ballot types).\n\n# Sampling the chain-based certificate under separation (polynomial in K)\n\nSeparation condition. Fix c and pivot b. Let the baseline chain be S_1=C, and for j=1,\u2026,K\u22122 pick e_j \u2208 argmin_{e\u2208S_j\\{b,c}} t_e(S_j) with the election\u2019s deterministic tie\u2011breaking, S_{j+1}=S_j\\{e_j}. Define the round\u2011j \u201cgap\u201d between the loser and the second loser among S_j\\{b,c} as\n  \u03bc_j := min_{x\u2208S_j\\{b,c,e_j}} ( t_x(S_j) \u2212 t_{e_j}(S_j) ), and let \u03bc := min_j \u03bc_j.\nAssume \u03bc>0.\n\nAlgorithm (sample-split).\n- Stage 1 (chain identification). Draw m_1 i.i.d. ballots. For j=1,\u2026,K\u22122, compute empirical tallies on S_j^hat (starting S_1^hat=C) and set e_j^hat to the empirical argmin over S_j^hat\\{b,c} (using the official tie\u2011breaking); set S_{j+1}^hat=S_j^hat\\{e_j^hat}.\n- Stage 2 (deficits on the chain). Independently draw m_2 ballots. Estimate t_c(S_j), t_b(S_j), t_{e_j}(S_j) for j=1,\u2026,K\u22122, and t_c({b,c}), t_b({b,c}). Form A_b(\u03b3), B_b(\u03b3), D_{b,c}(\u03b3) and the certificate \u03b5_b^*(\u03b3).\n- Decision. Option 1: Fix b in advance (e.g., scan all b via a union bound). Option 2: Choose \\hat b minimizing the plug\u2011in \u03b5_b^*(\u03b3) across b\u2208C\\{c}.\n\nGuarantee. There exist absolute constants c_1,c_2 such that:\n- m_1 \u2265 c_1 \u03bc^{-2} log( (K\u22122)/\u03b4 ) ensures P( e_j^hat = e_j \u2200j ) \u2265 1\u2212\u03b4/2, since each step\u2019s misidentification needs a deviation \u2265 \u03bc/2 and there are \u2264K\u22122 steps.\n- Conditional on Stage 1 success, if m_2 \u2265 c_2 \u03c4^{-2} log( (3(K\u22122)+2)/\u03b4 ), then with probability \u22651\u2212\u03b4/2 all estimates of the 3(K\u22122)+2 needed tallies are within \u00b1\u03c4. Because the map (these tallies) \u21a6 \u03b5_b^*(\u03b3) is 1\u2011Lipschitz in each argument and piecewise linear with l_1\u2011subgradients of norm \u2264 3 (for A,B) and \u2264 1 (for D inside the max), we can take a global sup\u2011norm Lipschitz constant L\u22646. Hence |\\widehat{\u03b5}_b^*(\u03b3) \u2212 \u03b5_b^*(\u03b3)| \u2264 L\u03c4.\n- Taking a union bound over b (K\u22121 choices) multiplies the Stage 2 logarithmic factor by at most log(K\u22121).\nThus with m_1 = O(\u03bc^{-2} log(K/\u03b4)) and m_2 = O(\u03c4^{-2} log(K/\u03b4)), the procedure certifies any b for which \u03b5_b^*(\u03b3) \u2264 \u03b5 \u2212 L\u03c4 with probability \u2265 1\u2212\u03b4. Choosing \u03c4=\u0398(\u03b5) yields m_2=\u0398((log(K/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2).\n\nRemarks.\n- When \u03bc is tiny, Stage 1 is unstable; a safe fallback is the distribution\u2011free c\u2011first certificate M_c with uniform convergence (exponential in K but no separation needed).\n- For K=3, \u03bc is vacuous (there is only one step) and the result reduces to the known \u0398((log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2) sampling bound using five tallies.\n\n# Slight sharpening for the c-first certificate\u2019s union bound\n\nLemma (counting). For a fixed target c, the number of indicator functions of the form r \u21a6 1[top_S(r)=a] with c\u2208S and a\u2208S\\{c} equals\n  N_c = \u2211_{s=2}^K C(K\u22121, s\u22121) (s\u22121) = (K\u22121) 2^{K\u22122}.\nProof. For each subset size s, choose the s\u22121 companions of c in C(K\u22121, s\u22121) ways and then the winner a among the s\u22121 non\u2011c elements.\n\nConsequently, for certifying a fixed c via M_c, Hoeffding + union bound over N_c indicators yields m = O( (log N_c + log(1/\u03b4))/\u03c4^2 ) = O( ((K\u22121) + log(1/\u03b4))/\u03c4^2 ) with the 2^{K\u22122} factor entering only inside the logarithm. This modestly improves the constant hidden in the big\u2011O compared to a crude K\u00b72^{K\u22121} count.\n\n# Examples and checks\n\n- K=3 exactness via lower bound: With p_a=0.38, p_b=0.35, p_c=0.27, and t_c({b,c})\u2212t_b({b,c})=0.10, picking b as the pivot and \u03b3\u21920 yields A^{(1)}=0.11, B^{(1)}=0.03, D=\u22120.10, hence L_b(0)=0.03+max{0.11, \u22120.07}=0.14, matching the exact \u03b5_a^* from the notes. The lower bound is tight.\n- Chain vs. lower bound gap (schematic): For K\u22654, if along the baseline chain some later-round minimum t_{e_j}(S_j) greatly exceeds p_min^{(b,c)}, then A_b(\u03b3) or B_b(\u03b3) can be much larger than A^{(1)}_b(\u03b3), B^{(1)}_b(\u03b3). The lower bound L_b(\u03b3) detects only the unavoidable round\u20111 and final costs; any strict gap \u03b5_b^*(\u03b3)\u2212L_b(\u03b3) suggests a potential for mixed\u2011type additions that alter the path (e.g., using \u201crest\u201d ballots to steer eliminations) and possibly approach L_b(\u03b3). Constructing an explicit tight example remains to be done (see Obstacles/Next steps).\n\n# Obstacles\n\n- Explicit K\u22654 separation example. While L_b(\u03b3) \u2264 \u03b5_b^*(\u03b3) always holds, producing a concrete P and an explicit mixed\u2011type augmentation y that achieves a total mass strictly below \u03b5_b^*(\u03b3) (hence close to L_b(\u03b3)) requires careful control so that the \u201crest\u201d ballots do not increase later minima enough to force larger \u03b1 or \u03b2. This is delicate because added ballots may change multiple round\u2011j minima simultaneously.\n- Fixed\u2011order LP sensitivity. The dual\u2011norm bound sup_{\u03bb\u2208\u039b} \u2225\u03bb\u2225_1 remains open; naive summation arguments fail due to the negative term at j = pos_\u03c0(x). Progress likely needs either a structured dual construction with per\u2011round normalization or a relaxation that preserves value up to a small factor with provable Lipschitzness.\n\n# Next steps\n\n- Add the Round\u20111 + final lower bound (Theorem) and its K=3 tightness corollary to proofs.md; this clarifies what is fundamentally unavoidable in any augmentation targeting a specific final opponent.\n- Pursue an explicit K=4 instance with a strict chain vs. lower\u2011bound gap and construct a three\u2011type augmentation that achieves a cost below the chain certificate (but above the lower bound), validating the role of path alterations.\n- Extend the two\u2011stage sampling theorem to the \u201cmin over b\u201d selection, with an explicit union\u2011bound accounting for at most (K\u22121)(3(K\u22122)+2)=O(K^2) tallies.\n- Explore whether additional structural conditions (e.g., bounded transfer volatility across S_j) imply that \u03b5_b^*(\u03b3) equals L_b(\u03b3) for some b, yielding near\u2011exact certificates beyond K=3.\n- Lower bounds: formalize a Fano/packing family {P_i} over i\u2208[K] where exactly one candidate i is an \u03b5\u2011winner and the P_i are pairwise close (KL=\u0398(\u03b5^2)), giving m = \u03a9((log K)/\u03b5^2) for the general problem. The construction can key off small independent perturbations of c vs i head\u2011to\u2011head and the round\u20111 minima while keeping all other statistics equal up to O(\u03b5).\n"
