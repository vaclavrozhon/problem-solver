  "summary_md": "This round validated and formalized sampling certificates and exact/approximate augmentation formulas for IRV \u03b5-winners. Key validated results: (1) a distribution-free c-first sufficient certificate M_c := max_{S\u2286C, c\u2208S}[min_{a\u2260c} t_a(S)\u2212t_c(S)]_+ with plug-in sampling m = \u0398((K+log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2); (2) an exact K=3 two-type minimal-augmentation formula \u03b5^*(c)=min{\u03b5_a^*,\u03b5_b^*}, computable from five tallies and decidable with m = \u0398((log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2); (3) a general-K chain-based two-type sufficient certificate (pivot b) \u03b5_b^* = B_b+max{A_b,B_b+D_{b,c}} depending on O(K) subset-tallies and, under a verifiable chain-stability margin, certifiable with m = \u0398((log K + log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2); (4) an LP fixed-order primal/dual exactly characterizes minimal augmentation but its dual-sensitivity constant R_K (sup ||\u03bb||_1) remains open. Information-theoretic lower bound \u03a9((1/\u03b5^2) log(1/\u03b4)) holds. Citations: proofs.md, output.md.",
  "highlights": [
    "Distribution-free c-first certificate M_c is a sound sufficient condition; plug-in testing needs m=\u0398((K+log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2).",
    "Exact K=3 two-type reduction: \u03b5^*(c)=min{\u03b5_a^*,\u03b5_b^*} (closed form), requires five tallies; decides with m=\u0398((log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2).",
    "Concrete counterexample shows c-first can be loose (e.g. a=0.38,b=0.35,c=0.27: minimal augmentation 0.14 < 0.20).",
    "General-K chain-based two-type certificate (pivot b): \u03b5_b^*=B_b+max{A_b,B_b+D_{b,c}}; sufficient, O(K) tallies, and verifiable chain-stability gives m=\u0398((log K+log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2).",
    "LP fixed-order primal/dual gives exact characterization, but prior attempts to bound dual 1-norm (R_K) are incorrect; bounding R_K=poly(K) is open.",
    "Information-theoretic lower bound m=\u03a9((1/\u03b5^2) log(1/\u03b4)) is necessary; K-dependent lower bounds (e.g. \u03a9((log K)/\u03b5^2)) remain to be formalized."
