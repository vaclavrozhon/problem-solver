# Problem Statement

We consider the problem of estimating the winner in an election run under **Ranked Choice Voting** (also known as *Instant-Runoff Voting*).  

Suppose there are \(K\) candidates. Each voter submits a complete ranking of these candidates. The voting rule proceeds in rounds: in each round, every ballot is assigned to the top-ranked candidate who is still in contention. The candidate with the smallest number of votes is eliminated (with ties broken according to a fixed deterministic rule), and this candidate is crossed out from all ballots. The process repeats until only one candidate remains, who is declared the winner.

Our goal is not to compute the exact winner from the full set of ballots, but rather to estimate a *robust* winner from a random sample of ballots. To make this precise, we introduce the notion of an **ε-winner**. A candidate \(c\) is called an ε-winner of an election profile if it is possible to add at most an ε-fraction of additional ballots to the election so that \(c\) becomes the winner under Ranked Choice Voting. In other words, \(c\) is “close” to being the true winner, in the sense that a small perturbation of the electorate would make \(c\) win. There may be more ε-winners. The real winner is ε-winner for any ε. 

The sampling model is as follows. We assume there is a large population of voters, each ballot drawn independently from the empirical distribution of this population. The algorithm does not see all the ballots; instead, it may sample ballots at random, with replacement. The task of the algorithm is: given parameters \(\varepsilon\) and \(\delta\), and access to at most \(m\) random ballots, output a candidate \(\hat{c}\) such that with probability at least \(1-\delta\), the candidate \(\hat{c}\) is an ε-winner of the true election.

The central question is: **what is the sample complexity of this problem?**  
That is, how many samples \(m\) are sufficient (and necessary) in order for an algorithm to reliably identify an ε-winner with probability at least \(1-\delta\)? We seek both upper bounds, by designing sampling algorithms and analyzing their guarantees, and lower bounds, by proving that no algorithm can succeed with significantly fewer than a certain number of samples.

# Corrected certificate and counterexample for K = 3

Notation: For a candidate set C with |C| = K and any nonempty S ⊆ C with c ∈ S and |S| ≥ 2, define t_a(S) = Pr[top among S is a] under the population distribution P over full rankings.

Corrected c-first certificate: Define

M_c(P) := max_{S ⊆ C, c ∈ S, |S| ≥ 2} [ min_{a ∈ S \ {c}} t_a(S) − t_c(S) ]_+.

If ε > M_c(P), then adding ε' (with 0 < ε' ≤ ε) mass of c-first ballots ensures that in every subset S encountered along any IRV elimination path, c's tally strictly exceeds the minimum among S \ {c}, so c cannot be eliminated and is the eventual winner. This yields a sound, distribution-free sufficient condition. Note the strict inequality requirement; in algorithmic use we maintain a margin so that ε' < ε and ties do not involve c.

Uniform estimation: The family {1[top_S(r) = a]} over all (a, S) has size K · 2^{K-1}. Hoeffding + union bound gives uniform estimation of all t_a(S) within ±τ using m = O((log(K · 2^{K-1}) + log(1/δ))/τ^2) samples. The plug-in estimate \hat M_c satisfies |\hat M_c − M_c| ≤ 2τ.

Counterexample to "K = 3 exactness" of c-first certificate: Let first-place shares be a = 0.38, b = 0.35, c = 0.27. Suppose c beats b head-to-head by margin m = 0.10 but loses to a by margin 0.20. The c-first certificate f_c requires ε ≥ max{0.35 − 0.27, 0.20, 0} = 0.20. However, adding α = 0.11 of c-first ballots and β = 0.03 of b-first ballots yields new first-place tallies c' = 0.38, b' = 0.38, a' = 0.38 (with tiny extra slack to make a uniquely minimal). Then a is eliminated first; in the final, the c vs b margin is m + α − β = 0.10 + 0.11 − 0.03 = 0.18 > 0, so c wins. Total added mass ≈ 0.14 < 0.20. Thus, for K = 3, the minimal augmentation need not equal the c-first-only threshold. A full characterization must allow mixed additions.

LP approach (status and caveats): For a fixed elimination order π, the condition that π(j) is eliminated at round j can be written linearly in terms of the baseline tallies t_a(S_j) and the additive contributions of the added mass y(r) via indicators 1[top_{S_j}(r) = a]. This leads to a linear program minimizing total added mass. To be rigorous one must encode the fixed tie-breaking rule (e.g., by strict inequalities or lexicographic tie constraints). Sensitivity of the LP optimum to perturbations in the t_a(S) (estimated from samples) is the key technical step for a polynomial-in-K sample bound using this approach; deriving an explicit O(poly(K)) Lipschitz constant remains open.

Lower bounds: The Ω((1/ε^2) log(1/δ)) dependence is necessary even for K = 2 (majority). Stronger K-dependent lower bounds (Ω((log K)/ε^2) or Ω(K/ε^2)) are plausible but require explicit constructions.

Next steps summary:
- Formalize LP with tie-breaking and derive sensitivity bounds.
- Provide a correct, closed-form minimal-augmentation characterization for K = 3 allowing mixed additions (compare two strategies: avoid facing a losing opponent by flipping the first-round loser vs. directly fixing the head-to-head deficit).
- Explore whether the worst-case S for the c-first certificate can be restricted by |S| ≤ r for a constant r.
- Build K-dependent lower bounds via Fano/packing constructions over top-of-S events.


## K = 3: exact minimal augmentation via two-type reduction

Let C = {a,b,c} and fix target winner c. Denote first-round shares p_x := t_x({a,b,c}) and pairwise shares t_x({b,c}), t_x({a,c}). To remove dependence on tie-breaking, introduce a slack γ > 0 and require strict separations in all inequalities.

Targeting elimination of a in round 1 and a c vs b final, it suffices to consider only two added ballot types: c-first (amount α ≥ 0) and b-first (amount β ≥ 0). These induce the linear constraints
- First round: p_a + 0 ≤ p_b + β − γ and p_a + 0 ≤ p_c + α − γ, i.e.,
  β ≥ B_γ := [p_a − p_b + γ]_+ and α ≥ A_γ := [p_a − p_c + γ]_+.
- Final: t'_c({b,c}) ≥ t'_b({b,c}) + γ, i.e., α − β ≥ D_γ := t_b({b,c}) − t_c({b,c}) + γ.
The minimum total mass is then
  ε_a^*(γ) = min_{α,β≥0} {α+β : α ≥ A_γ, β ≥ B_γ, α − β ≥ D_γ} = B_γ + max{A_γ, B_γ + D_γ}.
By a dominance argument, a-first additions are never optimal for this targeted strategy: if an a-first ballot ranks c ≻ b, it is dominated by a c-first ballot (strictly improves both elimination inequalities and matches the bc margin); if it ranks b ≻ c, it is dominated by a b-first ballot (improves the relevant elimination inequality and matches the bc margin). The symmetric expression ε_b^*(γ) is obtained by swapping a and b. The exact minimal augmentation to make c win is
  ε^*(γ; c) = min{ε_a^*(γ), ε_b^*(γ)}, and ε^*(c) = lim_{γ→0^+} ε^*(γ; c).
This matches the counterexample in the notes (a=0.38, b=0.35, c=0.27 with c beating b head-to-head): A_0=0.11, B_0=0.03, D_0=−0.10, hence ε_a^*(0) = 0.03 + max{0.11, −0.07} = 0.14.

Sampling for K = 3: Computing ε^*(γ; c) requires only five tallies: p_a, p_b, p_c, t_c({b,c}), t_c({a,c}). A Hoeffding + union bound over these five quantities gives m = Θ((log(1/δ))/ε^2) samples to decide whether ε^*(c) ≤ ε with probability ≥ 1 − δ.

## LP approach: primal/dual and sensitivity status (general K)

For a fixed elimination order π with remaining sets S_j = {π(j),...,π(K)}, add slack γ > 0 and consider variables y(r) ≥ 0 over rankings r. The primal is
- Minimize ∥y∥_1 subject to, for each j and a ∈ S_j \ {π(j)}:
  (t_a(S_j) − t_{π(j)}(S_j)) + ∑_r y(r)(1[top_{S_j}(r)=a] − 1[top_{S_j}(r)=π(j)]) ≥ γ.
Moving baseline tallies to the RHS gives constraints Ay ≥ b, with b_{j,a} = γ − (t_a(S_j) − t_{π(j)}(S_j)). The dual is
- Maximize ∑_{j}∑_{a≠π(j)} λ_{j,a}·(γ − (t_a(S_j) − t_{π(j)}(S_j))) subject to, for every ranking r,
  ∑_{j}∑_{a≠π(j)} λ_{j,a}(1[top_{S_j}(r)=a] − 1[top_{S_j}(r)=π(j)]) ≤ 1, and λ ≥ 0.
Sensitivity: v(b) = max_{λ∈Λ} b^T λ is 1-Lipschitz in the dual norm: |v(b+Δ) − v(b)| ≤ (sup_{λ∈Λ} ∥λ∥_1) ∥Δ∥_∞. Bounding R_K := sup_{λ∈Λ} ∥λ∥_1 by poly(K) would yield a polynomial-in-K sample bound for certifying a fixed π. For K = 3, the two-type reduction collapses Λ to two variables, giving R_3 ≤ 2. For general K, obtaining a good bound on R_K remains open; the per-constraint additive mass approach is invalid because a single added ranking can decrease other constraints when it tops the round-j loser.

## Checklist / next steps
- Formalize the K = 3 theorem and sampling corollary in output.md.
- Keep general c-first certifier and uniform convergence in output.md; use the K = 3 exact result when K = 3.
- Pursue a dual-based sensitivity bound sup_{λ∈Λ} ∥λ∥_1 = poly(K) or an approximate scheme with provable stability.
- Investigate few-type reductions for K ≥ 4 when targeting specific first eliminations.

Updates (verifier audit)

- Invalid general-K two-type claim (first-round-based). It is not enough to compare only first-round shares p_x. Later-round tallies t_w(S) can substantially exceed p_w after transfers. Counterexample sketch (K=4): Let p=(0.26,0.26,0.23,0.25) for (a,b,c,y). Suppose after removing a the tallies on S={b,c,y} are (t_b,t_c,t_y)=(0.40,0.25,0.35). A two-type bound computed only from p would take A*≈0.03 and B*≈0.01, which does not keep c,y above b in S: c would still be the round-2 loser. Any sound certificate must use the relevant subset tallies t_w(S).

- Dual sensitivity (fixed-order LP): prior attempts to bound sup_{λ} ||λ||_1 by K or K−1 dropped the negative term at j=pos_π(x) in the dual constraints. Including it makes the ‘sum over x’ argument cancel, giving no bound. The sensitivity constant remains open.

- Sound general-K two-type (chain) certificate. For target c and pivot b, let S_1=C and iteratively remove e_j = argmin_{e∈S_j\{b,c}} t_e(S_j), with the same deterministic tie-breaking as the election, forming S_{j+1}=S_j\{e_j}. Define
  A_b(γ)=max_j [t_{e_j}(S_j)−t_c(S_j)+γ]_+,
  B_b(γ)=max_j [t_{e_j}(S_j)−t_b(S_j)+γ]_+,
  D_{b,c}(γ)=t_b({b,c})−t_c({b,c})+γ.
Adding α≥A_b(γ) of c-first and β≥B_b(γ) of b-first ballots ensures elimination of e_1,…,e_{K−2} in order and a strict c-over-b final if α−β≥D_{b,c}(γ). The minimal two-type mass is B_b+max{A_b, B_b+D_{b,c}}. This is a sufficient, efficiently checkable condition depending on O(K) subset tallies (those on the chain sets S_j and the final pair).

- K=3 exact formula. The minimal augmentation to make c win is ε^*(γ;c)=min{ε_a^*(γ), ε_b^*(γ)}, where for first-eliminate a: A_γ=[p_a−p_c+γ]_+, B_γ=[p_a−p_b+γ]_+, D_γ=t_b({b,c})−t_c({b,c})+γ, and ε_a^*(γ)=B_γ+max{A_γ, B_γ+D_γ}. This matches the earlier counterexample and strictly improves the c-first certificate. A safe plug-in Lipschitz constant is 6 under sup-norm perturbations of the five required tallies.

Next steps
- Formalize the chain-based certificate (statement and proof) and add it to proofs.md; keep the K=3 exact theorem and the c-first certificate with sampling.
- Construct a K≥4 instance where adding a third ballot type strictly reduces the required mass relative to the two-type bound.
- Pursue a correct dual-norm bound for the fixed-order LP (retain negative contributions); explore alternative dual test rankings or decompositions by rounds.
- Lower bounds: formalize a Fano/packing family showing Ω((log K)/ε^2) for identifying a favorable opponent y among K−1 possibilities.


New validated results and corrections

- Chain-based two-type certificate (general K). For target c and pivot b, form the baseline chain S_1=C and e_j=argmin_{e∈S_j\{b,c}} t_e(S_j) (ties per the fixed rule), S_{j+1}=S_j\{e_j}. Define A_b(γ)=max_j [t_{e_j}(S_j)−t_c(S_j)+γ]_+, B_b(γ)=max_j [t_{e_j}(S_j)−t_b(S_j)+γ]_+, D_{b,c}(γ)=t_b({b,c})−t_c({b,c})+γ. Adding α c-first and β b-first with α≥A_b, β≥B_b, α−β≥D_{b,c} eliminates e_1,…,e_{K−2} in order and elects c over b with strict margins. The optimal two-type mass is ε_b^*(γ)=B_b+max{A_b, B_b+D_{b,c}}. This generalizes the K=3 exact formula and is a sound sufficient condition for K≥4.

- Sampling via chain-stability. If the empirical gaps along the chain, \hat g_j = min_{x∈\hat S_j\{\hat e_j}} \hat t_x(\hat S_j) − \hat t_{\hat e_j}(\hat S_j), exceed 4τ, then with high probability the empirical chain equals the true chain, and the plug-in cost deviates by ≤6τ. Using sample-splitting and Hoeffding bounds over O(K^2) tallies yields m = Θ((log K + log(1/δ))/ε^2) under this verifiable margin condition.

- Necessary lower bound (round‑1 + final). For any augmentation achieving a {b,c} final with a strict c-over-b win by γ, the total added mass satisfies ∥y∥_1 ≥ L_b(γ):=B_b^{(1)}(γ)+max{A_b^{(1)}(γ), B_b^{(1)}(γ)+D_{b,c}(γ)}, where A_b^{(1)}(γ)=[p_min^{(b,c)}−p_c+γ]_+, B_b^{(1)}(γ)=[p_min^{(b,c)}−p_b+γ]_+. This is tight for K=3 and lower-bounds ε_b^* since S_1=C contributes to A_b,B_b.

- Corrections. (i) The first-round-only two-type claim is invalid; later-round tallies t_w(S) can differ greatly from p_w. (ii) Attempts to bound the fixed-order LP dual norm by K or K−1 dropped negative terms in the dual constraints; a correct polynomial bound remains open.

Next steps
- Formalize an Ω((log K)/ε^2) lower bound via Fano over pivots b.
- Construct a K≥4 instance where a 3-type augmentation strictly improves over ε_b^*(γ).
- Seek a valid polynomial dual-norm bound or local (margin-dependent) sensitivity for the fixed-order LP.

Main results on sampling ε-winners under IRV

- Sufficient certificate (all K; distribution-free). Define M_c:=max_{S⊆C, c∈S, |S|≥2} [min_{a∈S\{c}} t_a(S) − t_c(S)]_+. If ε > M_c, adding ε of c-first ballots makes c win. With m = Θ((K + log(1/δ))/ε^2) ballots, we can uniformly estimate the needed tallies and certify any such c with high probability.

- Exact characterization for K = 3. For C={a,b,c}, the minimal added mass to make c win is ε^*(c)=min{ε_a^*, ε_b^*}, where for eliminating a first,
  ε_a^* = [p_a−p_b]_+ + max{ [p_a−p_c]_+, [p_a−p_b]_+ + (t_b({b,c})−t_c({b,c})) }.
Estimating the five required tallies to accuracy Θ(ε) with m = Θ((log(1/δ))/ε^2) suffices to decide ε^*(c) ≤ ε w.h.p.

- Chain-based two-type certificate (general K; efficient). Fix a pivot b and form the baseline chain by iteratively removing the minimal among S_j\{b,c}. Let A_b:=max_j [t_{e_j}(S_j)−t_c(S_j)]_+, B_b:=max_j [t_{e_j}(S_j)−t_b(S_j)]_+, and D_{b,c}:=t_b({b,c})−t_c({b,c}). Adding α c-first and β b-first with α ≥ A_b, β ≥ B_b, and α−β ≥ D_{b,c} elects c; the optimal two-type mass is ε_b^* = B_b + max{A_b, B_b + D_{b,c}}. Under a verifiable chain-stability margin, a plug-in test certifies c with m = Θ((log K + log(1/δ))/ε^2).

- General necessary lower bound (round‑1 + final). For any augmentation achieving a {b,c} final with a strict c-over-b win, the total mass satisfies ∥y∥_1 ≥ L_b := B_b^{(1)} + max{A_b^{(1)}, B_b^{(1)} + D_{b,c}}, where A_b^{(1)}=[p_min^{(b,c)}−p_c]_+ and B_b^{(1)}=[p_min^{(b,c)}−p_b]_+. This bound is tight for K=3 and lower-bounds ε_b^* for any pivot b.

- Lower bound (baseline). Any algorithm needs m = Ω((1/ε^2) log(1/δ)) samples even for K = 2 (majority). A Ω((log K)/ε^2) dependence is necessary for certificates that must identify a favorable opponent among K−1 options (formalization via Fano is in progress).


=== Verifier Summary ===

We validated and formalized a general-K chain-based two-type certificate (fix pivot b, follow the minimal-of-others chain, cost ε = B_b + max{A_b, B_b + D_{b,c}}), exact for K=3 and efficiently checkable. We added a chain-stability lemma and a sample-splitting sampling guarantee with margin 6τ, yielding m = Θ((log K + log(1/δ))/ε^2) under verifiable gaps. We also proved a general necessary lower bound L_b(γ) (round-1 + final), tight for K=3 and lower-bounding the chain certificate. The fixed-order LP dual-norm bound remains open; earlier K or K−1 claims are invalid. Next: formalize a Ω((log K)/ε^2) lower bound via Fano and exhibit a K≥4 instance where ≥3 types strictly beat the two-type bound.

# Notes



# Corrected certificate and counterexample for K = 3

Notation: For a candidate set C with |C| = K and any nonempty S ⊆ C with c ∈ S and |S| ≥ 2, define t_a(S) = Pr[top among S is a] under the population distribution P over full rankings.

Corrected c-first certificate: Define

M_c(P) := max_{S ⊆ C, c ∈ S, |S| ≥ 2} [ min_{a ∈ S \ {c}} t_a(S) − t_c(S) ]_+.

If ε > M_c(P), then adding ε' (with 0 < ε' ≤ ε) mass of c-first ballots ensures that in every subset S encountered along any IRV elimination path, c's tally strictly exceeds the minimum among S \ {c}, so c cannot be eliminated and is the eventual winner. This yields a sound, distribution-free sufficient condition. Note the strict inequality requirement; in algorithmic use we maintain a margin so that ε' < ε and ties do not involve c.

Uniform estimation: The family {1[top_S(r) = a]} over all (a, S) has size K · 2^{K-1}. Hoeffding + union bound gives uniform estimation of all t_a(S) within ±τ using m = O((log(K · 2^{K-1}) + log(1/δ))/τ^2) samples. The plug-in estimate \hat M_c satisfies |\hat M_c − M_c| ≤ 2τ.

Counterexample to "K = 3 exactness" of c-first certificate: Let first-place shares be a = 0.38, b = 0.35, c = 0.27. Suppose c beats b head-to-head by margin m = 0.10 but loses to a by margin 0.20. The c-first certificate f_c requires ε ≥ max{0.35 − 0.27, 0.20, 0} = 0.20. However, adding α = 0.11 of c-first ballots and β = 0.03 of b-first ballots yields new first-place tallies c' = 0.38, b' = 0.38, a' = 0.38 (with tiny extra slack to make a uniquely minimal). Then a is eliminated first; in the final, the c vs b margin is m + α − β = 0.10 + 0.11 − 0.03 = 0.18 > 0, so c wins. Total added mass ≈ 0.14 < 0.20. Thus, for K = 3, the minimal augmentation need not equal the c-first-only threshold. A full characterization must allow mixed additions.

LP approach (status and caveats): For a fixed elimination order π, the condition that π(j) is eliminated at round j can be written linearly in terms of the baseline tallies t_a(S_j) and the additive contributions of the added mass y(r) via indicators 1[top_{S_j}(r) = a]. This leads to a linear program minimizing total added mass. To be rigorous one must encode the fixed tie-breaking rule (e.g., by strict inequalities or lexicographic tie constraints). Sensitivity of the LP optimum to perturbations in the t_a(S) (estimated from samples) is the key technical step for a polynomial-in-K sample bound using this approach; deriving an explicit O(poly(K)) Lipschitz constant remains open.

Lower bounds: The Ω((1/ε^2) log(1/δ)) dependence is necessary even for K = 2 (majority). Stronger K-dependent lower bounds (Ω((log K)/ε^2) or Ω(K/ε^2)) are plausible but require explicit constructions.

Next steps summary:
- Formalize LP with tie-breaking and derive sensitivity bounds.
- Provide a correct, closed-form minimal-augmentation characterization for K = 3 allowing mixed additions (compare two strategies: avoid facing a losing opponent by flipping the first-round loser vs. directly fixing the head-to-head deficit).
- Explore whether the worst-case S for the c-first certificate can be restricted by |S| ≤ r for a constant r.
- Build K-dependent lower bounds via Fano/packing constructions over top-of-S events.


## K = 3: exact minimal augmentation via two-type reduction

Let C = {a,b,c} and fix target winner c. Denote first-round shares p_x := t_x({a,b,c}) and pairwise shares t_x({b,c}), t_x({a,c}). To remove dependence on tie-breaking, introduce a slack γ > 0 and require strict separations in all inequalities.

Targeting elimination of a in round 1 and a c vs b final, it suffices to consider only two added ballot types: c-first (amount α ≥ 0) and b-first (amount β ≥ 0). These induce the linear constraints
- First round: p_a + 0 ≤ p_b + β − γ and p_a + 0 ≤ p_c + α − γ, i.e.,
  β ≥ B_γ := [p_a − p_b + γ]_+ and α ≥ A_γ := [p_a − p_c + γ]_+.
- Final: t'_c({b,c}) ≥ t'_b({b,c}) + γ, i.e., α − β ≥ D_γ := t_b({b,c}) − t_c({b,c}) + γ.
The minimum total mass is then
  ε_a^*(γ) = min_{α,β≥0} {α+β : α ≥ A_γ, β ≥ B_γ, α − β ≥ D_γ} = B_γ + max{A_γ, B_γ + D_γ}.
By a dominance argument, a-first additions are never optimal for this targeted strategy: if an a-first ballot ranks c ≻ b, it is dominated by a c-first ballot (strictly improves both elimination inequalities and matches the bc margin); if it ranks b ≻ c, it is dominated by a b-first ballot (improves the relevant elimination inequality and matches the bc margin). The symmetric expression ε_b^*(γ) is obtained by swapping a and b. The exact minimal augmentation to make c win is
  ε^*(γ; c) = min{ε_a^*(γ), ε_b^*(γ)}, and ε^*(c) = lim_{γ→0^+} ε^*(γ; c).
This matches the counterexample in the notes (a=0.38, b=0.35, c=0.27 with c beating b head-to-head): A_0=0.11, B_0=0.03, D_0=−0.10, hence ε_a^*(0) = 0.03 + max{0.11, −0.07} = 0.14.

Sampling for K = 3: Computing ε^*(γ; c) requires only five tallies: p_a, p_b, p_c, t_c({b,c}), t_c({a,c}). A Hoeffding + union bound over these five quantities gives m = Θ((log(1/δ))/ε^2) samples to decide whether ε^*(c) ≤ ε with probability ≥ 1 − δ.

## LP approach: primal/dual and sensitivity status (general K)

For a fixed elimination order π with remaining sets S_j = {π(j),...,π(K)}, add slack γ > 0 and consider variables y(r) ≥ 0 over rankings r. The primal is
- Minimize ∥y∥_1 subject to, for each j and a ∈ S_j \ {π(j)}:
  (t_a(S_j) − t_{π(j)}(S_j)) + ∑_r y(r)(1[top_{S_j}(r)=a] − 1[top_{S_j}(r)=π(j)]) ≥ γ.
Moving baseline tallies to the RHS gives constraints Ay ≥ b, with b_{j,a} = γ − (t_a(S_j) − t_{π(j)}(S_j)). The dual is
- Maximize ∑_{j}∑_{a≠π(j)} λ_{j,a}·(γ − (t_a(S_j) − t_{π(j)}(S_j))) subject to, for every ranking r,
  ∑_{j}∑_{a≠π(j)} λ_{j,a}(1[top_{S_j}(r)=a] − 1[top_{S_j}(r)=π(j)]) ≤ 1, and λ ≥ 0.
Sensitivity: v(b) = max_{λ∈Λ} b^T λ is 1-Lipschitz in the dual norm: |v(b+Δ) − v(b)| ≤ (sup_{λ∈Λ} ∥λ∥_1) ∥Δ∥_∞. Bounding R_K := sup_{λ∈Λ} ∥λ∥_1 by poly(K) would yield a polynomial-in-K sample bound for certifying a fixed π. For K = 3, the two-type reduction collapses Λ to two variables, giving R_3 ≤ 2. For general K, obtaining a good bound on R_K remains open; the per-constraint additive mass approach is invalid because a single added ranking can decrease other constraints when it tops the round-j loser.

## Checklist / next steps
- Formalize the K = 3 theorem and sampling corollary in output.md.
- Keep general c-first certifier and uniform convergence in output.md; use the K = 3 exact result when K = 3.
- Pursue a dual-based sensitivity bound sup_{λ∈Λ} ∥λ∥_1 = poly(K) or an approximate scheme with provable stability.
- Investigate few-type reductions for K ≥ 4 when targeting specific first eliminations.

Updates (verifier audit)

- Invalid general-K two-type claim (first-round-based). It is not enough to compare only first-round shares p_x. Later-round tallies t_w(S) can substantially exceed p_w after transfers. Counterexample sketch (K=4): Let p=(0.26,0.26,0.23,0.25) for (a,b,c,y). Suppose after removing a the tallies on S={b,c,y} are (t_b,t_c,t_y)=(0.40,0.25,0.35). A two-type bound computed only from p would take A*≈0.03 and B*≈0.01, which does not keep c,y above b in S: c would still be the round-2 loser. Any sound certificate must use the relevant subset tallies t_w(S).

- Dual sensitivity (fixed-order LP): prior attempts to bound sup_{λ} ||λ||_1 by K or K−1 dropped the negative term at j=pos_π(x) in the dual constraints. Including it makes the ‘sum over x’ argument cancel, giving no bound. The sensitivity constant remains open.

- Sound general-K two-type (chain) certificate. For target c and pivot b, let S_1=C and iteratively remove e_j = argmin_{e∈S_j\{b,c}} t_e(S_j), with the same deterministic tie-breaking as the election, forming S_{j+1}=S_j\{e_j}. Define
  A_b(γ)=max_j [t_{e_j}(S_j)−t_c(S_j)+γ]_+,
  B_b(γ)=max_j [t_{e_j}(S_j)−t_b(S_j)+γ]_+,
  D_{b,c}(γ)=t_b({b,c})−t_c({b,c})+γ.
Adding α≥A_b(γ) of c-first and β≥B_b(γ) of b-first ballots ensures elimination of e_1,…,e_{K−2} in order and a strict c-over-b final if α−β≥D_{b,c}(γ). The minimal two-type mass is B_b+max{A_b, B_b+D_{b,c}}. This is a sufficient, efficiently checkable condition depending on O(K) subset tallies (those on the chain sets S_j and the final pair).

- K=3 exact formula. The minimal augmentation to make c win is ε^*(γ;c)=min{ε_a^*(γ), ε_b^*(γ)}, where for first-eliminate a: A_γ=[p_a−p_c+γ]_+, B_γ=[p_a−p_b+γ]_+, D_γ=t_b({b,c})−t_c({b,c})+γ, and ε_a^*(γ)=B_γ+max{A_γ, B_γ+D_γ}. This matches the earlier counterexample and strictly improves the c-first certificate. A safe plug-in Lipschitz constant is 6 under sup-norm perturbations of the five required tallies.

Next steps
- Formalize the chain-based certificate (statement and proof) and add it to proofs.md; keep the K=3 exact theorem and the c-first certificate with sampling.
- Construct a K≥4 instance where adding a third ballot type strictly reduces the required mass relative to the two-type bound.
- Pursue a correct dual-norm bound for the fixed-order LP (retain negative contributions); explore alternative dual test rankings or decompositions by rounds.
- Lower bounds: formalize a Fano/packing family showing Ω((log K)/ε^2) for identifying a favorable opponent y among K−1 possibilities.


New validated results and corrections

- Chain-based two-type certificate (general K). For target c and pivot b, form the baseline chain S_1=C and e_j=argmin_{e∈S_j\{b,c}} t_e(S_j) (ties per the fixed rule), S_{j+1}=S_j\{e_j}. Define A_b(γ)=max_j [t_{e_j}(S_j)−t_c(S_j)+γ]_+, B_b(γ)=max_j [t_{e_j}(S_j)−t_b(S_j)+γ]_+, D_{b,c}(γ)=t_b({b,c})−t_c({b,c})+γ. Adding α c-first and β b-first with α≥A_b, β≥B_b, α−β≥D_{b,c} eliminates e_1,…,e_{K−2} in order and elects c over b with strict margins. The optimal two-type mass is ε_b^*(γ)=B_b+max{A_b, B_b+D_{b,c}}. This generalizes the K=3 exact formula and is a sound sufficient condition for K≥4.

- Sampling via chain-stability. If the empirical gaps along the chain, \hat g_j = min_{x∈\hat S_j\{\hat e_j}} \hat t_x(\hat S_j) − \hat t_{\hat e_j}(\hat S_j), exceed 4τ, then with high probability the empirical chain equals the true chain, and the plug-in cost deviates by ≤6τ. Using sample-splitting and Hoeffding bounds over O(K^2) tallies yields m = Θ((log K + log(1/δ))/ε^2) under this verifiable margin condition.

- Necessary lower bound (round‑1 + final). For any augmentation achieving a {b,c} final with a strict c-over-b win by γ, the total added mass satisfies ∥y∥_1 ≥ L_b(γ):=B_b^{(1)}(γ)+max{A_b^{(1)}(γ), B_b^{(1)}(γ)+D_{b,c}(γ)}, where A_b^{(1)}(γ)=[p_min^{(b,c)}−p_c+γ]_+, B_b^{(1)}(γ)=[p_min^{(b,c)}−p_b+γ]_+. This is tight for K=3 and lower-bounds ε_b^* since S_1=C contributes to A_b,B_b.

- Corrections. (i) The first-round-only two-type claim is invalid; later-round tallies t_w(S) can differ greatly from p_w. (ii) Attempts to bound the fixed-order LP dual norm by K or K−1 dropped negative terms in the dual constraints; a correct polynomial bound remains open.

Next steps
- Formalize an Ω((log K)/ε^2) lower bound via Fano over pivots b.
- Construct a K≥4 instance where a 3-type augmentation strictly improves over ε_b^*(γ).
- Seek a valid polynomial dual-norm bound or local (margin-dependent) sensitivity for the fixed-order LP.

# Rigorous Proofs



Preliminaries

- Candidates C, |C|=K. For nonempty S⊆C and a∈S, let t_a(S)=Pr[top among S is a] under the population distribution over full rankings. Adding a nonnegative measure y on rankings (||y||_1 denotes its total mass) updates tallies additively: t'_a(S)=t_a(S)+∑_r y(r) 1[top_S(r)=a]. We assume a fixed deterministic tie-breaking rule; we enforce strict margins via a slack γ>0 so ties are irrelevant.

Theorem 1 (Uniform convergence for top-of-S tallies).
Let F={1[top_S(r)=a]: a∈S⊆C, |S|≥1}. For m i.i.d. ballots and any δ∈(0,1), with probability ≥1−δ we have sup_{a,S} |\hat t_a(S)−t_a(S)| ≤ τ whenever m ≥ c (log(K·2^{K−1})+log(2/δ))/τ^2 for a universal constant c.

Proof. Hoeffding’s inequality and a union bound over |F| ≤ K·2^{K−1}.

Theorem 2 (Sufficient c-first certificate).
Fix c∈C and define M_c:=max_{S⊆C, c∈S, |S|≥2} [min_{a∈S\{c}} t_a(S) − t_c(S)]_+. If ε > M_c, then adding any ε' with M_c < ε' ≤ ε of c-first ballots makes c the IRV winner (strictly, by γ absorbed into ε').

Proof. For each S with c∈S, t'_c(S)=t_c(S)+ε' > min_{a≠c} t_a(S), so c is never the unique minimum in any round and thus survives to win.

Corollary 3 (Sampling for the c-first certificate).
Let \hat M_c be the plug-in estimator of M_c from \hat t. Then |\hat M_c−M_c| ≤ 2τ under sup_{a,S} |\hat t_a(S)−t_a(S)| ≤ τ. Consequently, output any c with \hat M_c ≤ ε−2τ; with probability ≥1−δ, c is an ε-winner. Taking τ=ε/4 gives m=Θ((K+log(1/δ))/ε^2).

Proof. For fixed S, the map (t_a(S))_{a∈S} ↦ min_{a≠c} t_a(S) − t_c(S) is 2-Lipschitz in sup norm; positive part and max preserve Lipschitzness.

Proposition 4 (Necessary ε,δ dependence).
Any algorithm that outputs an ε-winner with probability ≥1−δ requires m=Ω((1/ε^2) log(1/δ)).

Proof. For K=2 (majority), distinguishing µ≥1/2−ε from µ≤1/2−2ε needs Ω((1/ε^2) log(1/δ)).

Theorem 5 (K=3 exact minimal augmentation).
Let C={a,b,c} and fix target c. Write first-round shares p_x:=t_x({a,b,c}) and pairwise tallies t_x({b,c}), t_x({a,c}). For γ>0 define
A_γ:=[p_a−p_c+γ]_+,
B_γ:=[p_a−p_b+γ]_+,
D_γ:=t_b({b,c})−t_c({b,c})+γ.
Let ε_a^*(γ) be the minimum total mass needed to eliminate a first and make c beat b in the final by ≥γ. Then ε_a^*(γ)=B_γ+max{A_γ, B_γ+D_γ}. Symmetrically, ε_b^*(γ)=B'_γ+max{A'_γ, B'_γ+D'_γ} with a↔b. The exact minimal augmentation is ε^*(γ;c)=min{ε_a^*(γ), ε_b^*(γ)}, and ε^*(c)=lim_{γ→0^+} ε^*(γ;c).

Proof. Sufficiency: adding α c-first and β b-first changes p'_a=p_a, p'_b=p_b+β, p'_c=p_c+α, so a is strictly below both b and c in round 1 if α≥A_γ and β≥B_γ. In the final, t'_c({b,c})−t'_b({b,c})=(t_c−t_b)+α−β, so α−β≥D_γ ensures a strict c-over-b win. Optimality over two types reduces to minimizing α+β over α≥A_γ, β≥B_γ, α−β≥D_γ, whose solution is β=B_γ and α=max{A_γ, B_γ+D_γ}. Taking the better of eliminating a or b first yields ε^*(γ;c).

Theorem 6 (General K chain-based two-type certificate).
Fix c∈C and choose a pivot b∈C\{c}. Set S_1:=C. For j=1,…,K−2, let e_j be the (tie-broken) minimizer of t_e(S_j) over e∈S_j\{b,c}, and define S_{j+1}:=S_j\{e_j}. Let
A_b(γ):=max_{1≤j≤K−2} [t_{e_j}(S_j)−t_c(S_j)+γ]_+,
B_b(γ):=max_{1≤j≤K−2} [t_{e_j}(S_j)−t_b(S_j)+γ]_+,
D_{b,c}(γ):=t_b({b,c})−t_c({b,c})+γ.
If we add α≥0 of c-first ballots and β≥0 of b-first ballots with α≥A_b(γ), β≥B_b(γ), and α−β≥D_{b,c}(γ), then the IRV elimination proceeds by removing e_1,…,e_{K−2} (in order) before {b,c}, and c defeats b in the final by ≥γ. Among such two-type additions, the minimum total mass is
ε_b^*(γ)=B_b(γ)+max{A_b(γ), B_b(γ)+D_{b,c}(γ)}.

Proof. Induct on j. For S_j, by construction e_j is the minimal among S_j\{b,c}. Since only c and b tallies increase, all other candidates remain at baseline and e_j remains the (tie-broken) minimum among S_j\{b,c}. The constraints α≥A_b(γ), β≥B_b(γ) imply t'_c(S_j)>t'_{e_j}(S_j) and t'_b(S_j)>t'_{e_j}(S_j), so e_j is the unique minimum in S_j and is eliminated. This yields S_{j+1}. In the final between b and c, each c-first (resp. b-first) ballot adds +1 to t'_c({b,c}) (resp. t'_b({b,c})), so α−β≥D_{b,c}(γ) ensures a strict c-over-b win. Minimizing α+β over the three halfspaces gives β=B_b(γ) and α=max{A_b(γ), B_b(γ)+D_{b,c}(γ)}.

Corollary 7 (K=3 sampling for exact ε^*).
Estimating the five quantities {p_a,p_b,p_c,t_c({b,c}),t_c({a,c})} within τ by m=Θ((log(1/δ))/τ^2) samples and using a safety margin 6τ yields a correct plug-in decision with probability ≥1−δ. Choosing τ=Θ(ε) gives m=Θ((log(1/δ))/ε^2).


Preliminaries. Candidates C, |C|=K≥3. For nonempty S⊆C and a∈S, let t_a(S)=Pr[top among S is a] under the baseline population distribution. Adding a nonnegative measure y over rankings updates tallies additively. A fixed deterministic tie-breaking rule is assumed; we enforce strict margins via γ>0.

Theorem (Chain-based two-type certificate; general K). Fix target c∈C and pivot b∈C\{c}. Define S_1:=C and, for j=1,…,K−2, let e_j ∈ argmin_{e∈S_j\{b,c}} t_e(S_j) (ties by the election’s rule) and S_{j+1}:=S_j\{e_j}. Set
A_b(γ):=max_{1≤j≤K−2} [t_{e_j}(S_j)−t_c(S_j)+γ]_+,
B_b(γ):=max_{1≤j≤K−2} [t_{e_j}(S_j)−t_b(S_j)+γ]_+,
D_{b,c}(γ):=t_b({b,c})−t_c({b,c})+γ.
If we add α≥0 c-first and β≥0 b-first ballots with α≥A_b(γ), β≥B_b(γ), and α−β≥D_{b,c}(γ), then the IRV process eliminates e_1,…,e_{K−2} in order and c strictly defeats b in the final. Among such two-type augmentations, the minimum total mass equals
ε_b^*(γ)=B_b(γ)+max{A_b(γ), B_b(γ)+D_{b,c}(γ)}.

Proof. For each S_j, adding α (resp. β) increases t_c(S_j) (resp. t_b(S_j)) by α (resp. β) and leaves t_x(S_j) unchanged for x∈S_j\{b,c}. Hence α≥A_b and β≥B_b ensure t'_{e_j}(S_j) ≤ min{t'_b(S_j), t'_c(S_j)}−γ, so e_j is the unique minimum and is eliminated. In the final {b,c}, t'_c−t'_b=(t_c−t_b)+(α−β), so α−β≥D_{b,c} yields a strict c win. Minimizing α+β over α≥A_b, β≥B_b, α−β≥D_{b,c} gives β=B_b and α=max{A_b, B_b+D_{b,c}}.

Corollary (K=3 exactness). When K=3, the chain has one element and ε^*(γ;c)=min_{b≠c} ε_b^*(γ) agrees with the closed-form K=3 formula previously derived.

Lemma (Two-type dominance for the targeted chain). Any feasible augmentation realizing the chain e_1,…,e_{K−2} and a strict c-over-b final can be replaced by a two-type augmentation (c-first and b-first only) of no larger mass that also realizes the same chain and final.

Proof. Remove any mass placed on rankings r with top_{S_j}(r)=e_j for some j (they only increase t_{e_j}(S_j), harming feasibility). For remaining ballots, replace r by c-first if top_{\{b,c\}}(r)=c, else by b-first if top_{\{b,c\}}(r)=b. This preserves the final pairwise difference and (weakly) increases t_b(S_j) or t_c(S_j) while never increasing any t_{e_j}(S_j), so all chain constraints remain feasible or get slackened.

Theorem (Round‑1 + final necessary lower bound). Fix c and b≠c. Let p_x:=t_x(C) and p_min^{(b,c)}:=min_{x∈C\{b,c}} p_x. Define A_b^{(1)}(γ):=[p_min^{(b,c)}−p_c+γ]_+, B_b^{(1)}(γ):=[p_min^{(b,c)}−p_b+γ]_+, and D_{b,c}(γ):=t_b({b,c})−t_c({b,c})+γ. For any augmentation y that yields a {b,c} final with c strictly defeating b by ≥γ, the total mass satisfies
∥y∥_1 ≥ L_b(γ):=B_b^{(1)}(γ)+max{A_b^{(1)}(γ), B_b^{(1)}(γ)+D_{b,c}(γ)}.
Moreover, equality holds for K=3.

Proof. Decompose y into y_c (top_C=c), y_b (top_C=b), and y_rest with masses α, β, ϑ, so ∥y∥_1=α+β+ϑ. In round 1, to avoid eliminating c or b, we must have p'_c=p_c+α ≥ p_min^{(b,c)}+γ and p'_b=p_b+β ≥ p_min^{(b,c)}+γ, giving α≥A_b^{(1)} and β≥B_b^{(1)}. In the final {b,c}, the updated margin is (t_c−t_b)+(α−β)+(θ_c−θ_b), where θ_c−θ_b is the net contribution from y_rest to the pairwise difference and satisfies |θ_c−θ_b|≤ϑ; thus α−β+ϑ ≥ D_{b,c}(γ). Minimizing α+β+ϑ subject to α≥A, β≥B, and α−β+ϑ ≥ D yields the optimum B+max{A, B+D}, attained by taking β=B and α=max{A, B+D−ϑ} with ϑ chosen to make the final constraint tight. Substituting A=A_b^{(1)}, B=B_b^{(1)}, D=D_{b,c} proves the bound. For K=3, these are also sufficient (via two-type additions), yielding equality.

Remark. For K≥4 and any b, ε_b^*(γ) ≥ L_b(γ) since A_b(γ) ≥ A_b^{(1)}(γ) and B_b(γ) ≥ B_b^{(1)}(γ).

Lemma (Chain stability and plug-in error). If sup over all tallies used on the chain satisfies |\hat t−t| ≤ τ and each round-j gap Δ_j:=min_{x∈S_j\{b,c,e_j}} (t_x(S_j)−t_{e_j}(S_j)) ≥ 2τ, then the empirical chain equals the true chain and |\widehat{A}_b−A_b|, |\widehat{B}_b−B_b|, |\widehat{D}_{b,c}−D_{b,c}| ≤ 2τ. Consequently, |\widehat{ε}_b^*(γ)−ε_b^*(γ)| ≤ 6τ.

Proof. Stability of argmin under sup-norm perturbations preserves each e_j by induction on j. Each difference t_{e_j}(S_j)−t_c(S_j) or t_{e_j}(S_j)−t_b(S_j) perturbs by ≤2τ; positive part and max preserve Lipschitzness. The map (A,B,D)↦B+max{A, B+D} is 3-Lipschitz in sup norm, giving ≤6τ overall.

Sampling corollary (sample-splitting). Using one half-sample to compute the empirical chain and verify empirical gaps \hat g_j ≥ 4τ, and the other half to estimate the O(K^2) tallies on the chain and the final pair within ±τ (Hoeffding + union bound), we obtain a sound decision rule: certify c via b if \widehat{ε}_b^*(γ) ≤ ε − 6τ. With τ=Θ(ε), m=Θ((log K + log(1/δ))/ε^2) samples suffice to make this certification correct with probability ≥1−δ under the verified gap condition.

Main results on sampling ε-winners under IRV

- Sufficient certificate (all K; distribution-free). Define M_c:=max_{S⊆C, c∈S, |S|≥2} [min_{a∈S\{c}} t_a(S) − t_c(S)]_+. If ε > M_c, adding ε of c-first ballots makes c win. With m = Θ((K + log(1/δ))/ε^2) ballots, we can uniformly estimate the needed tallies and certify any such c with high probability.

- Exact characterization for K = 3. For C={a,b,c}, the minimal added mass to make c win is ε^*(c)=min{ε_a^*, ε_b^*}, where for eliminating a first,
  ε_a^* = [p_a−p_b]_+ + max{ [p_a−p_c]_+, [p_a−p_b]_+ + (t_b({b,c})−t_c({b,c})) }.
Estimating the five required tallies to accuracy Θ(ε) with m = Θ((log(1/δ))/ε^2) suffices to decide ε^*(c) ≤ ε w.h.p.

- Chain-based two-type certificate (general K; efficient). Fix a pivot b and form the baseline chain by iteratively removing the minimal among S_j\{b,c}. Let A_b:=max_j [t_{e_j}(S_j)−t_c(S_j)]_+, B_b:=max_j [t_{e_j}(S_j)−t_b(S_j)]_+, and D_{b,c}:=t_b({b,c})−t_c({b,c}). Adding α c-first and β b-first with α ≥ A_b, β ≥ B_b, and α−β ≥ D_{b,c} elects c; the optimal two-type mass is ε_b^* = B_b + max{A_b, B_b + D_{b,c}}. Under a verifiable chain-stability margin, a plug-in test certifies c with m = Θ((log K + log(1/δ))/ε^2).

- General necessary lower bound (round‑1 + final). For any augmentation achieving a {b,c} final with a strict c-over-b win, the total mass satisfies ∥y∥_1 ≥ L_b := B_b^{(1)} + max{A_b^{(1)}, B_b^{(1)} + D_{b,c}}, where A_b^{(1)}=[p_min^{(b,c)}−p_c]_+ and B_b^{(1)}=[p_min^{(b,c)}−p_b]_+. This bound is tight for K=3 and lower-bounds ε_b^* for any pivot b.

- Lower bound (baseline). Any algorithm needs m = Ω((1/ε^2) log(1/δ)) samples even for K = 2 (majority). A Ω((log K)/ε^2) dependence is necessary for certificates that must identify a favorable opponent among K−1 options (formalization via Fano is in progress).
