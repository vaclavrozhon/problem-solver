{"summary_md":"This round validated and formalized sampling certificates and exact/approximate augmentation formulas for IRV ε-winners. Key validated results: (1) a distribution-free c-first sufficient certificate M_c := max_{S⊆C, c∈S}[min_{a≠c} t_a(S)−t_c(S)]_+ with plug-in sampling m = Θ((K+log(1/δ))/ε^2); (2) an exact K=3 two-type minimal-augmentation formula ε^*(c)=min{ε_a^*,ε_b^*}, computable from five tallies and decidable with m = Θ((log(1/δ))/ε^2); (3) a general-K chain-based two-type sufficient certificate (pivot b) ε_b^* = B_b+max{A_b,B_b+D_{b,c}} depending on O(K) subset-tallies and, under a verifiable chain-stability margin, certifiable with m = Θ((log K + log(1/δ))/ε^2); (4) an LP fixed-order primal/dual exactly characterizes minimal augmentation but its dual-sensitivity constant R_K (sup ||λ||_1) remains open. Information-theoretic lower bound Ω((1/ε^2) log(1/δ)) holds.
