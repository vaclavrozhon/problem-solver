Key takeaways: The general-K chain-based two-type certificate is sound and worth elevating to proofs/output; the previously attempted first-round-only two-type claim is invalid; the fixed-order LP dual-norm bound remains open; a clean, general necessary lower bound (round-1 + final) is now available and tight for K=3. Below are per-prover audits and next steps.

Prover 1: Strong contribution. Your chain-based two-type certificate (fix pivot b, follow the minimal-of-others chain e_j, and require α ≥ A_b, β ≥ B_b, α−β ≥ D_{b,c}) is correct, and the two-variable minimization yields ε = B_b + max{A_b, B_b + D_{b,c}}. The dominance/cleanup argument (removing mass that tops e_j, and redirecting to c-first/b-first based on top_{\{b,c\}}) is valid for this targeted plan. The chain-stability lemma under sup-norm error and the 6τ plug-in margin are correct; the sample-splitting design to avoid exponential unions is appropriate. Your counterexample to first-round-only claims and the log K lower bound for the two-type certificate are sound sketches. Next: formalize the Fano argument and provide a K≥4 separation where ≥3 types strictly improve over two-type.

Prover 2: Your theorem/proof of the chain certificate matches P1 and is correct. The “cleanup lemma” is sound for the targeted chain. The “monotone minimality” condition yields exactness within that chain; this is a useful special case. You correctly flag the dual-norm issue as open. The sampling theorem under chain-stability is well stated. Next: sharpen constants if possible and provide an explicit stability check procedure that is data-driven (as in sample-splitting), with all logs accounted for in m.

Prover 3: The chain certificate statement and L≤6 Lipschitz bound are fine. However, your sampling lemma estimates only the tallies on the (unknown) true chain; without a chain-identification step (or sample-splitting), this is not implementable. Please revise to include either sample-splitting with a gap check or a union bound that covers all candidate chains’ tallies (which would reintroduce large complexity). Also, keep the dual sensitivity as open; do not rely on the earlier (invalid) K or K−1 norm bounds.

Prover 4: Valuable necessary lower bound: L_b(γ) = B_b^{(1)} + max{A_b^{(1)}, B_b^{(1)} + D_{b,c}} is indeed a universal lower bound for any augmentation achieving a {b,c} final with a strict c-over-b win, and it is tight for K=3. This also lower-bounds the chain certificate since S_1 = C contributes to A_b, B_b. Your sampling split and counting refinements are consistent with the above. Next: construct a concrete K≥4 profile where a 3-type augmentation beats the chain bound yet respects the lower bound.

Next steps (global): (i) Add chain-based theorem and sampling corollary (with stability) to proofs; (ii) add the round-1 + final lower bound to proofs and summarize both in output; (iii) formalize the Ω((log K)/ε^2) lower bound via Fano; (iv) pursue a correct dual sensitivity bound or a local (margin-dependent) repair argument; (v) produce a K≥4 separation example demonstrating two-type suboptimality.
