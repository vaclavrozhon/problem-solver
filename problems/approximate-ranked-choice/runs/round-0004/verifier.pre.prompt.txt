# Problem Statement

We consider the problem of estimating the winner in an election run under **Ranked Choice Voting** (also known as *Instant-Runoff Voting*).  

Suppose there are \(K\) candidates. Each voter submits a complete ranking of these candidates. The voting rule proceeds in rounds: in each round, every ballot is assigned to the top-ranked candidate who is still in contention. The candidate with the smallest number of votes is eliminated (with ties broken according to a fixed deterministic rule), and this candidate is crossed out from all ballots. The process repeats until only one candidate remains, who is declared the winner.

Our goal is not to compute the exact winner from the full set of ballots, but rather to estimate a *robust* winner from a random sample of ballots. To make this precise, we introduce the notion of an **ε-winner**. A candidate \(c\) is called an ε-winner of an election profile if it is possible to add at most an ε-fraction of additional ballots to the election so that \(c\) becomes the winner under Ranked Choice Voting. In other words, \(c\) is “close” to being the true winner, in the sense that a small perturbation of the electorate would make \(c\) win. There may be more ε-winners. The real winner is ε-winner for any ε. 

The sampling model is as follows. We assume there is a large population of voters, each ballot drawn independently from the empirical distribution of this population. The algorithm does not see all the ballots; instead, it may sample ballots at random, with replacement. The task of the algorithm is: given parameters \(\varepsilon\) and \(\delta\), and access to at most \(m\) random ballots, output a candidate \(\hat{c}\) such that with probability at least \(1-\delta\), the candidate \(\hat{c}\) is an ε-winner of the true election.

The central question is: **what is the sample complexity of this problem?**  
That is, how many samples \(m\) are sufficient (and necessary) in order for an algorithm to reliably identify an ε-winner with probability at least \(1-\delta\)? We seek both upper bounds, by designing sampling algorithms and analyzing their guarantees, and lower bounds, by proving that no algorithm can succeed with significantly fewer than a certain number of samples.

# Corrected certificate and counterexample for K = 3

Notation: For a candidate set C with |C| = K and any nonempty S ⊆ C with c ∈ S and |S| ≥ 2, define t_a(S) = Pr[top among S is a] under the population distribution P over full rankings.

Corrected c-first certificate: Define

M_c(P) := max_{S ⊆ C, c ∈ S, |S| ≥ 2} [ min_{a ∈ S \ {c}} t_a(S) − t_c(S) ]_+.

If ε > M_c(P), then adding ε' (with 0 < ε' ≤ ε) mass of c-first ballots ensures that in every subset S encountered along any IRV elimination path, c's tally strictly exceeds the minimum among S \ {c}, so c cannot be eliminated and is the eventual winner. This yields a sound, distribution-free sufficient condition. Note the strict inequality requirement; in algorithmic use we maintain a margin so that ε' < ε and ties do not involve c.

Uniform estimation: The family {1[top_S(r) = a]} over all (a, S) has size K · 2^{K-1}. Hoeffding + union bound gives uniform estimation of all t_a(S) within ±τ using m = O((log(K · 2^{K-1}) + log(1/δ))/τ^2) samples. The plug-in estimate \hat M_c satisfies |\hat M_c − M_c| ≤ 2τ.

Counterexample to "K = 3 exactness" of c-first certificate: Let first-place shares be a = 0.38, b = 0.35, c = 0.27. Suppose c beats b head-to-head by margin m = 0.10 but loses to a by margin 0.20. The c-first certificate f_c requires ε ≥ max{0.35 − 0.27, 0.20, 0} = 0.20. However, adding α = 0.11 of c-first ballots and β = 0.03 of b-first ballots yields new first-place tallies c' = 0.38, b' = 0.38, a' = 0.38 (with tiny extra slack to make a uniquely minimal). Then a is eliminated first; in the final, the c vs b margin is m + α − β = 0.10 + 0.11 − 0.03 = 0.18 > 0, so c wins. Total added mass ≈ 0.14 < 0.20. Thus, for K = 3, the minimal augmentation need not equal the c-first-only threshold. A full characterization must allow mixed additions.

LP approach (status and caveats): For a fixed elimination order π, the condition that π(j) is eliminated at round j can be written linearly in terms of the baseline tallies t_a(S_j) and the additive contributions of the added mass y(r) via indicators 1[top_{S_j}(r) = a]. This leads to a linear program minimizing total added mass. To be rigorous one must encode the fixed tie-breaking rule (e.g., by strict inequalities or lexicographic tie constraints). Sensitivity of the LP optimum to perturbations in the t_a(S) (estimated from samples) is the key technical step for a polynomial-in-K sample bound using this approach; deriving an explicit O(poly(K)) Lipschitz constant remains open.

Lower bounds: The Ω((1/ε^2) log(1/δ)) dependence is necessary even for K = 2 (majority). Stronger K-dependent lower bounds (Ω((log K)/ε^2) or Ω(K/ε^2)) are plausible but require explicit constructions.

Next steps summary:
- Formalize LP with tie-breaking and derive sensitivity bounds.
- Provide a correct, closed-form minimal-augmentation characterization for K = 3 allowing mixed additions (compare two strategies: avoid facing a losing opponent by flipping the first-round loser vs. directly fixing the head-to-head deficit).
- Explore whether the worst-case S for the c-first certificate can be restricted by |S| ≤ r for a constant r.
- Build K-dependent lower bounds via Fano/packing constructions over top-of-S events.


## K = 3: exact minimal augmentation via two-type reduction

Let C = {a,b,c} and fix target winner c. Denote first-round shares p_x := t_x({a,b,c}) and pairwise shares t_x({b,c}), t_x({a,c}). To remove dependence on tie-breaking, introduce a slack γ > 0 and require strict separations in all inequalities.

Targeting elimination of a in round 1 and a c vs b final, it suffices to consider only two added ballot types: c-first (amount α ≥ 0) and b-first (amount β ≥ 0). These induce the linear constraints
- First round: p_a + 0 ≤ p_b + β − γ and p_a + 0 ≤ p_c + α − γ, i.e.,
  β ≥ B_γ := [p_a − p_b + γ]_+ and α ≥ A_γ := [p_a − p_c + γ]_+.
- Final: t'_c({b,c}) ≥ t'_b({b,c}) + γ, i.e., α − β ≥ D_γ := t_b({b,c}) − t_c({b,c}) + γ.
The minimum total mass is then
  ε_a^*(γ) = min_{α,β≥0} {α+β : α ≥ A_γ, β ≥ B_γ, α − β ≥ D_γ} = B_γ + max{A_γ, B_γ + D_γ}.
By a dominance argument, a-first additions are never optimal for this targeted strategy: if an a-first ballot ranks c ≻ b, it is dominated by a c-first ballot (strictly improves both elimination inequalities and matches the bc margin); if it ranks b ≻ c, it is dominated by a b-first ballot (improves the relevant elimination inequality and matches the bc margin). The symmetric expression ε_b^*(γ) is obtained by swapping a and b. The exact minimal augmentation to make c win is
  ε^*(γ; c) = min{ε_a^*(γ), ε_b^*(γ)}, and ε^*(c) = lim_{γ→0^+} ε^*(γ; c).
This matches the counterexample in the notes (a=0.38, b=0.35, c=0.27 with c beating b head-to-head): A_0=0.11, B_0=0.03, D_0=−0.10, hence ε_a^*(0) = 0.03 + max{0.11, −0.07} = 0.14.

Sampling for K = 3: Computing ε^*(γ; c) requires only five tallies: p_a, p_b, p_c, t_c({b,c}), t_c({a,c}). A Hoeffding + union bound over these five quantities gives m = Θ((log(1/δ))/ε^2) samples to decide whether ε^*(c) ≤ ε with probability ≥ 1 − δ.

## LP approach: primal/dual and sensitivity status (general K)

For a fixed elimination order π with remaining sets S_j = {π(j),...,π(K)}, add slack γ > 0 and consider variables y(r) ≥ 0 over rankings r. The primal is
- Minimize ∥y∥_1 subject to, for each j and a ∈ S_j \ {π(j)}:
  (t_a(S_j) − t_{π(j)}(S_j)) + ∑_r y(r)(1[top_{S_j}(r)=a] − 1[top_{S_j}(r)=π(j)]) ≥ γ.
Moving baseline tallies to the RHS gives constraints Ay ≥ b, with b_{j,a} = γ − (t_a(S_j) − t_{π(j)}(S_j)). The dual is
- Maximize ∑_{j}∑_{a≠π(j)} λ_{j,a}·(γ − (t_a(S_j) − t_{π(j)}(S_j))) subject to, for every ranking r,
  ∑_{j}∑_{a≠π(j)} λ_{j,a}(1[top_{S_j}(r)=a] − 1[top_{S_j}(r)=π(j)]) ≤ 1, and λ ≥ 0.
Sensitivity: v(b) = max_{λ∈Λ} b^T λ is 1-Lipschitz in the dual norm: |v(b+Δ) − v(b)| ≤ (sup_{λ∈Λ} ∥λ∥_1) ∥Δ∥_∞. Bounding R_K := sup_{λ∈Λ} ∥λ∥_1 by poly(K) would yield a polynomial-in-K sample bound for certifying a fixed π. For K = 3, the two-type reduction collapses Λ to two variables, giving R_3 ≤ 2. For general K, obtaining a good bound on R_K remains open; the per-constraint additive mass approach is invalid because a single added ranking can decrease other constraints when it tops the round-j loser.

## Checklist / next steps
- Formalize the K = 3 theorem and sampling corollary in output.md.
- Keep general c-first certifier and uniform convergence in output.md; use the K = 3 exact result when K = 3.
- Pursue a dual-based sensitivity bound sup_{λ∈Λ} ∥λ∥_1 = poly(K) or an approximate scheme with provable stability.
- Investigate few-type reductions for K ≥ 4 when targeting specific first eliminations.

Updates (verifier audit)

- Invalid general-K two-type claim (first-round-based). It is not enough to compare only first-round shares p_x. Later-round tallies t_w(S) can substantially exceed p_w after transfers. Counterexample sketch (K=4): Let p=(0.26,0.26,0.23,0.25) for (a,b,c,y). Suppose after removing a the tallies on S={b,c,y} are (t_b,t_c,t_y)=(0.40,0.25,0.35). A two-type bound computed only from p would take A*≈0.03 and B*≈0.01, which does not keep c,y above b in S: c would still be the round-2 loser. Any sound certificate must use the relevant subset tallies t_w(S).

- Dual sensitivity (fixed-order LP): prior attempts to bound sup_{λ} ||λ||_1 by K or K−1 dropped the negative term at j=pos_π(x) in the dual constraints. Including it makes the ‘sum over x’ argument cancel, giving no bound. The sensitivity constant remains open.

- Sound general-K two-type (chain) certificate. For target c and pivot b, let S_1=C and iteratively remove e_j = argmin_{e∈S_j\{b,c}} t_e(S_j), with the same deterministic tie-breaking as the election, forming S_{j+1}=S_j\{e_j}. Define
  A_b(γ)=max_j [t_{e_j}(S_j)−t_c(S_j)+γ]_+,
  B_b(γ)=max_j [t_{e_j}(S_j)−t_b(S_j)+γ]_+,
  D_{b,c}(γ)=t_b({b,c})−t_c({b,c})+γ.
Adding α≥A_b(γ) of c-first and β≥B_b(γ) of b-first ballots ensures elimination of e_1,…,e_{K−2} in order and a strict c-over-b final if α−β≥D_{b,c}(γ). The minimal two-type mass is B_b+max{A_b, B_b+D_{b,c}}. This is a sufficient, efficiently checkable condition depending on O(K) subset tallies (those on the chain sets S_j and the final pair).

- K=3 exact formula. The minimal augmentation to make c win is ε^*(γ;c)=min{ε_a^*(γ), ε_b^*(γ)}, where for first-eliminate a: A_γ=[p_a−p_c+γ]_+, B_γ=[p_a−p_b+γ]_+, D_γ=t_b({b,c})−t_c({b,c})+γ, and ε_a^*(γ)=B_γ+max{A_γ, B_γ+D_γ}. This matches the earlier counterexample and strictly improves the c-first certificate. A safe plug-in Lipschitz constant is 6 under sup-norm perturbations of the five required tallies.

Next steps
- Formalize the chain-based certificate (statement and proof) and add it to proofs.md; keep the K=3 exact theorem and the c-first certificate with sampling.
- Construct a K≥4 instance where adding a third ballot type strictly reduces the required mass relative to the two-type bound.
- Pursue a correct dual-norm bound for the fixed-order LP (retain negative contributions); explore alternative dual test rankings or decompositions by rounds.
- Lower bounds: formalize a Fano/packing family showing Ω((log K)/ε^2) for identifying a favorable opponent y among K−1 possibilities.

Main results on sampling ε-winners under IRV

- Sufficient certificate (all K): Define M_c:=max_{S⊆C, c∈S, |S|≥2} [min_{a∈S\{c}} t_a(S) − t_c(S)]_+. If ε > M_c, adding ε of c-first ballots makes c win. With m = Θ((K + log(1/δ))/ε^2) random ballots, we can uniformly estimate all required tallies and soundly certify any c with high probability.

- Exact characterization for K = 3: For C={a,b,c}, the minimal added mass to make c win is ε^*(c)=min{ε_a^*, ε_b^*}, where for eliminating a first,
  ε_a^* = [p_a−p_b]_+ + max{ [p_a−p_c]_+, [p_a−p_b]_+ + (t_b({b,c})−t_c({b,c})) },
with p_x = t_x({a,b,c}). Symmetrically for ε_b^*. Estimating the five needed tallies to accuracy Θ(ε) with m = Θ((log(1/δ))/ε^2) samples suffices to decide whether ε^*(c) ≤ ε with probability ≥ 1−δ.

- Lower bound: Any algorithm requires m = Ω((1/ε^2) log(1/δ)) samples even for K = 2 (majority).

# General-K chain-based two-type certificate (formal statement and proof)
Let C be a set of K ≥ 3 candidates, fix a target c ∈ C and a pivot b ∈ C\{c}, and fix a deterministic tie-breaking rule. For any nonempty S ⊆ C and a ∈ S, let t_a(S) = Pr[top_S(r) = a] under the population distribution over full rankings. Introduce a slack γ > 0 to enforce strict separations. Define the chain of remaining sets by S_1 := C and, for j = 1,…,K−2,
- e_j := argmin_{e ∈ S_j\{b,c}} t_e(S_j) (ties broken by the election’s rule),
- S_{j+1} := S_j\{e_j}.
Define
A_b(γ) := max_{1≤j≤K−2} [ t_{e_j}(S_j) − t_c(S_j) + γ ]_+,
B_b(γ) := max_{1≤j≤K−2} [ t_{e_j}(S_j) − t_b(S_j) + γ ]_+,
D_{b,c}(γ) := t_b({b,c}) − t_c({b,c}) + γ.
Consider augmentations restricted to two ballot types: c-first with total mass α ≥ 0, and b-first with total mass β ≥ 0. Then the following hold.

Theorem (Chain-based two-type certificate).
- Feasibility: If α ≥ A_b(γ), β ≥ B_b(γ), and α − β ≥ D_{b,c}(γ), then under IRV with the augmented profile: e_1,…,e_{K−2} are eliminated (in that order), and in the final round c strictly defeats b; in particular c is elected and tie-breaking is irrelevant.
- Optimality over two types: Among augmentations supported only on c-first and b-first ballots, the minimum total added mass achieving the above eliminations and final is
  ε^{(2)}_{b}(γ; c) = B_b(γ) + max{ A_b(γ), B_b(γ) + D_{b,c}(γ) }.
- Global two-type certificate for c: ε^{(2)}(γ; c) := min_{b≠c} ε^{(2)}_{b}(γ; c) is a sound sufficient bound on the minimal augmentation to make c win. The exact minimal augmentation for K = 3 equals ε^{(2)}(γ; c), and ε^{(2)}(c) := lim_{γ→0^+} ε^{(2)}(γ; c).

Proof.
Feasibility. Adding α c-first and β b-first ballots changes round-j tallies on S_j as: t'_x(S_j) = t_x(S_j) for x ∈ S_j\{b,c}, t'_c(S_j) = t_c(S_j) + α, t'_b(S_j) = t_b(S_j) + β. By the definitions of A_b(γ) and B_b(γ), for every j we have t'_c(S_j) ≥ t_{e_j}(S_j) + γ and t'_b(S_j) ≥ t_{e_j}(S_j) + γ. Since the non-{b,c} tallies are unchanged, among S_j the unique minimum is e_j (ties do not occur because of the γ slack), so e_j is eliminated, producing S_{j+1}. By induction, e_1,…,e_{K−2} are eliminated in order, leaving {b,c}. In the final, each c-first ballot contributes +1 to t'_c({b,c}) and each b-first contributes +1 to t'_b({b,c}), hence t'_c({b,c}) − t'_b({b,c}) = (t_c({b,c}) − t_b({b,c})) + (α − β). The constraint α − β ≥ D_{b,c}(γ) yields a strict final-round win for c.
Optimality over two types. Necessity of the three inequalities follows by the same per-round reasoning: at the round j where e_j is eliminated, both c and b must strictly exceed e_j’s tally, which is t_{e_j}(S_j); thus α ≥ [t_{e_j}(S_j) − t_c(S_j) + γ]_+ and β ≥ [t_{e_j}(S_j) − t_b(S_j) + γ]_+. The final-round strict win requires α − β ≥ D_{b,c}(γ). Minimizing α + β over the polyhedron {α ≥ A_b(γ), β ≥ B_b(γ), α − β ≥ D_{b,c}(γ)} is a two-variable linear program with optimum at β = B_b(γ) and α = max{A_b(γ), B_b(γ) + D_{b,c}(γ)}, giving ε^{(2)}_{b}(γ; c).
Dominance of two types for the targeted plan. Any added ballot that tops some e_j in some S_j increases t_{e_j}(S_j), tightening both A_b and B_b constraints; hence such ballots are weakly dominated by reallocating their mass to c-first or b-first without harming feasibility and not increasing α + β. Therefore, within the targeted plan “eliminate e_1,…,e_{K−2}, then c beats b,” it is sufficient and optimal to use only the two types. ∎

Remarks.
- This certificate is sufficient but not necessary for K ≥ 4; optimal augmentations may alter the chain (e_j) by using additional types to steer intermediate tallies. The theorem characterizes the optimal cost within the family of two-type strategies that keep the baseline chain.
- For K = 3 the chain has length 1 and the theorem specializes to the exact closed-form derived previously: ε_a^*(γ) = B_γ + max{A_γ, B_γ + D_γ} and symmetrically for eliminating b first; the minimum over the two pivots is the true minimal augmentation.

# Stability and sampling for the chain certificate
Define the chain gaps at each step j:
Δ_j := min_{w ∈ S_j\{b,c,e_j}} ( t_w(S_j) − t_{e_j}(S_j) ), with the convention Δ_j = +∞ if |S_j\{b,c}| = 1.
Let τ > 0 be an accuracy level.

Lemma (Chain stability under sup-norm error).
If sup_{S⊆C} sup_{a∈S} |\hat t_a(S) − t_a(S)| ≤ τ and Δ_j ≥ 2τ for all j, then the empirical chain computed from \hat t coincides with the true chain (same e_j and S_j), and moreover
|\widehat{A}_b(γ) − A_b(γ)| ≤ 2τ, |\widehat{B}_b(γ) − B_b(γ)| ≤ 2τ, and |\widehat{D}_{b,c}(γ) − D_{b,c}(γ)| ≤ 2τ.
Consequently,
|\widehat{ε}^{(2)}_{b}(γ; c) − ε^{(2)}_{b}(γ; c)| ≤ 6τ.

Proof.
By Δ_j ≥ 2τ and the sup error ≤ τ, the argmin over S_j\{b,c} is preserved at each j (standard stability of argmin under perturbations), so the empirical chain equals the true chain. For fixed j, the maps (t_{e_j}(S_j), t_c(S_j)) ↦ [t_{e_j}(S_j) − t_c(S_j) + γ]_+ and (t_{e_j}(S_j), t_b(S_j)) ↦ [t_{e_j}(S_j) − t_b(S_j) + γ]_+ are 2-Lipschitz under sup norm, and taking a maximum over j preserves Lipschitzness, giving |\widehat{A}_b − A_b|, |\widehat{B}_b − B_b| ≤ 2τ. Similarly, D_{b,c}(γ) depends on two pairwise tallies and is 2-Lipschitz. The map g(A,B,D) = B + max{A, B + D} changes by at most |δB| + max{|δA|, |δB| + |δD|} ≤ 3 max{|δA|,|δB|,|δD|}. A safe bound is 3·2τ = 6τ. ∎

Sampling procedure (sample splitting).
- Inputs: ε, δ, γ > 0, target c and pivot b.
- Draw m i.i.d. ballots and split into two halves of size ≈ m/2 each.
- On the first half, compute empirical tallies \tilde t_a(S) sequentially to build the empirical chain \tilde e_j and \tilde S_j: at step j use \tilde t on \tilde S_j to select \tilde e_j = argmin_{e ∈ \tilde S_j\{b,c}} \tilde t_e(\tilde S_j), producing \tilde S_{j+1} = \tilde S_j\{\tilde e_j}.
- On the second half, estimate the tallies needed only on the sets {\tilde S_j} and the pair {b,c}: for each j and x ∈ \tilde S_j, compute \hat t_x(\tilde S_j); also compute \hat t_c({b,c}), \hat t_b({b,c}). Check the empirical gap conditions \hatΔ_j := min_{w∈\tilde S_j\{b,c,\tilde e_j}}( \hat t_w(\tilde S_j) − \hat t_{\tilde e_j}(\tilde S_j) ) ≥ 2τ for all j. If these hold, evaluate \widehat{A}_b, \widehat{B}_b, \widehat{D}_{b,c} and certify c if
  \widehat{ε}^{(2)}_{b}(γ; c) = \widehat{B}_b + max{ \widehat{A}_b, \widehat{B}_b + \widehat{D}_{b,c} } ≤ ε − 6τ.
- If the gap checks fail, abstain (certificate inconclusive for this pivot), or enlarge m.

Sample complexity. The second half estimates at most N = ∑_{j=1}^{K−1} |\tilde S_j| + 2 ≤ (K + (K−1) + … + 2) + 2 = O(K^2) indicators of the form 1[top_S(r)=a]. By Hoeffding + union bound, choosing m = Θ((log(N/δ))/τ^2) = Θ((log K + log(1/δ))/τ^2) suffices to guarantee the sup error ≤ τ on the second half with probability ≥ 1 − δ/2. A similar union bound on the first half ensures the empirical chain equals the true chain whenever the true gaps Δ_j ≥ 4τ (to cover both halves). Overall, m = Θ((log K + log(1/δ))/ε^2) with τ = Θ(ε) certifies correctness with probability ≥ 1 − δ when margin conditions hold.

Remark (computable upper envelope without gap checks). For robustness without verifying chain stability, define
A_b^{env}(γ) := max_{1≤j≤K−2} max_{w∈S_j\{b,c}} [ t_w(S_j) − t_c(S_j) + γ ]_+,
B_b^{env}(γ) := max_{1≤j≤K−2} max_{w∈S_j\{b,c}} [ t_w(S_j) − t_b(S_j) + γ ]_+.
These satisfy A_b^{env} ≥ A_b, B_b^{env} ≥ B_b and thus yield a sound but potentially looser certificate with the same two-type mass formula. They require estimating all top-of-S tallies on the chain sets S_j, still O(K^2) numbers.

# Counterexample to first-round-only two-type claims (formalized)
Let K = 4 with C = {a,b,c,y}. Suppose first-round shares (on S_1=C) are p = (0.26, 0.26, 0.23, 0.25) for (a,b,c,y), and after removing a the tallies on S = {b,c,y} are (t_b(S), t_c(S), t_y(S)) = (0.40, 0.25, 0.35). Any certificate that compares only first-round shares would compute A* ≈ max{p_w − p_c : w∈{a,b,y}}_+ = 0.03 and B* ≈ max{p_w − p_y : w∈{a,b}}_+ = 0.01 for pivot y, and might conclude that adding α ≥ 0.03 of c-first and β ≥ 0.01 of y-first suffices to keep b below c and y in the second round. But in S={b,c,y}, b’s tally is 0.40, so c remains the round-2 loser (0.25), contradicting the claimed sufficiency. Hence any sound certificate must use the relevant subset tallies t_w(S), not just first-round shares.

# Lower bound: Ω((log K)/ε^2) for the two-type certificate
We exhibit a family of instances where certifying that c is an ε-winner via the two-type certificate reduces to identifying a favorable opponent among K − 1 possibilities.

Construction. Fix γ > 0 and set up profiles satisfying, for all b ≠ c and all S with {b,c} ⊆ S ⊆ C:
- Dominance: for every w ∈ S\{b,c}, t_w(S) ≤ min{ t_b(S), t_c(S) } − γ. Thus A_b(γ) = B_b(γ) = 0 for every pivot b.
- Pairwise gaps: for exactly one b* we have t_c({b*,c}) = 1/2 − ε, and for all other b ≠ b*, t_c({b,c}) ≤ 1/2 − 2ε.
Then ε^{(2)}(γ; c) ≤ ε iff there exists b with t_c({b,c}) ≥ 1/2 − ε (namely b = b*). Distinguishing H0: ∀b, t_c({b,c}) ≤ 1/2 − 2ε from H1: ∃! b*, t_c({b*,c}) = 1/2 − ε reduces to identifying the best among K − 1 Bernoulli means separated by ε. Standard lower bounds for best-arm identification (or Fano’s inequality with a (K − 1)-ary hypothesis) yield m = Ω((log K)/ε^2) samples to succeed with constant probability; scaling with log(1/δ) gives Ω((log K + log(1/δ))/ε^2). Therefore the log K factor in the sampling bound for the two-type certificate is information-theoretically necessary in this regime.

# Example: applying the chain certificate for K = 4
Let C = {a,b,c,d}, target c, pivot b, γ → 0^+. Suppose
- On S_1 = {a,b,c,d}: (t_a,t_b,t_c,t_d) = (0.18, 0.26, 0.25, 0.31). Then e_1 = a.
- On S_2 = {b,c,d}: (t_b,t_c,t_d) = (0.35, 0.32, 0.33). Then e_2 = d.
- Pairwise c vs b: t_c({b,c}) = 0.49 (so D_{b,c}(0) = 0.02).
Compute A_b(0) = max{ [0.18 − 0.25]_+, [0.33 − 0.32]_+ } = 0.01, B_b(0) = max{ [0.18 − 0.26]_+, [0.33 − 0.35]_+ } = 0. Hence ε^{(2)}_{b}(0; c) = 0 + max{0.01, 0.02} = 0.02. Adding 2% of c-first ballots suffices to certify c as an ε-winner via this chain.

# Obstacles and clarifications
- The chain-based two-type certificate is sufficient, not necessary, for K ≥ 4. Constructing an explicit K ≥ 4 instance where allowing a third ballot type strictly reduces the minimal augmentation below ε^{(2)}(γ; c) remains open; the natural approach is to design profiles where modest mass reorders the chain (e_j) to yield a cheaper path than any fixed-pivot two-type strategy.
- Fixed-order LP sensitivity: bounding sup_{λ∈Λ} ||λ||_1 in the dual remains open when the negative term at j = pos_π(x) is kept; previous bounds that dropped it were incorrect. A possible route is to exploit the nested structure of S_j to express dual constraints via a telescoping potential over rounds or to design dual solutions supported on at most one competitor per round; this is a promising but unproven direction.

# Next steps
- Add the formal chain-based theorem and proof above to proofs.md and summarize its sampling corollary (sample splitting, O(K^2) tallies, m = Θ((log K + log(1/δ))/ε^2) under gap margins) in output.md.
- Construct and verify a K = 4 separation example where a third ballot type reduces the required mass below ε^{(2)}(γ; c) (compute both the two-type bound and an LP-based feasible augmentation with three types).
- Pursue a rigorous dual sensitivity bound by exploring structured duals (e.g., per-round single-competitor support) and potential-function decompositions; even a coarse poly(K) bound would yield polynomial-in-K sample guarantees for fixed orders.
- Formalize the lower bound via Fano’s method for the dominance subclass above, making explicit a ranking distribution that realizes the required top-of-S and pairwise tallies.

Ideas
- Prove a general-K “chain-based two-type” sufficient certificate formally, including a clean dominance/cleanup argument and the exact minimizer α+β = B + max{A, B + D} for that chain. Why useful: gives an efficiently checkable sufficient condition using O(K) subset tallies and matches the K=3 exact formula when K=3.
- Provide a sampling theorem for the chain-certificate under a verifiable chain-stability margin condition, using only O(K^2) quantities and Hoeffding bounds.
- Record a special-case exactness result for K ≥ 4 under a strong “monotone minimality” hypothesis along the chain.
- Avoid the incorrect fixed-order dual-norm bound; instead, state a concrete obstruction and outline directions for bounding the dual norm or using repair arguments in restricted settings.

Theorem A (Chain-based two-type sufficient certificate; general K).
Fix target c and pivot b ≠ c. Let S_1 := C and, for j = 1,…,K−2, define e_j := argmin_{e∈S_j\{b,c}} t_e(S_j) with the election’s deterministic tie-breaking, and S_{j+1} := S_j\{e_j}. Define
A_b(γ) := max_{1≤j≤K−2} [t_{e_j}(S_j) − t_c(S_j) + γ]_+,
B_b(γ) := max_{1≤j≤K−2} [t_{e_j}(S_j) − t_b(S_j) + γ]_+,
D_{b,c}(γ) := t_b({b,c}) − t_c({b,c}) + γ.
If we add α ≥ 0 c-first and β ≥ 0 b-first ballots with
α ≥ A_b(γ), β ≥ B_b(γ), α − β ≥ D_{b,c}(γ),
then the IRV process eliminates e_1,…,e_{K−2} in order, followed by a strict c-over-b final; hence c wins. Moreover, among augmentations restricted to only these two types, the minimal mass is ε_spine(b;γ) = B_b(γ) + max{A_b(γ), B_b(γ) + D_{b,c}(γ)}.

Proof.
Effect of c-first and b-first on tallies: For any S containing c (resp. b), adding α c-first (resp. β b-first) increases t_c(S) (resp. t_b(S)) by α (resp. β) and leaves all other t_x(S) unchanged. In particular, for each j, t'_{e_j}(S_j) = t_{e_j}(S_j), t'_c(S_j) = t_c(S_j) + α, and t'_b(S_j) = t_b(S_j) + β.
- Chain eliminations: For each j and x ∈ S_j\{e_j}, baseline has t_{e_j}(S_j) ≤ t_x(S_j). For x ∈ S_j\{b,c}, both sides are unchanged by the augmentation, preserving strict inequalities once we enforce slack γ. For x = b,c, the constraints α ≥ A_b(γ) and β ≥ B_b(γ) ensure t'_{e_j}(S_j) ≤ min{t'_b(S_j), t'_c(S_j)} − γ. Hence, e_j remains the unique minimum of S_j and is eliminated (the strict margin removes tie-breaking dependence). Inductively, the chain S_1 ⊋ S_2 ⊋ ⋯ ⊋ S_{K−1} is realized.
- Final: In S_{K−1} = {b,c}, each added c-first (resp. b-first) ballot contributes +1 to t'_c − t'_b (resp. −1). The condition α − β ≥ D_{b,c}(γ) ensures t'_c({b,c}) ≥ t'_b({b,c}) + γ, so c defeats b strictly.
- Optimality with two types: The feasible region for (α,β) is 
{(α,β) ∈ R_+^2 : α ≥ A_b(γ), β ≥ B_b(γ), α − β ≥ D_{b,c}(γ)}.
Minimizing α+β over this polyhedron is attained at β = B_b(γ), α = max{A_b(γ), B_b(γ) + D_{b,c}(γ)}, giving ε_spine(b;γ).

Cleanup lemma (dominance of two-type ballots for this chain).
Let y be any feasible augmentation realizing the chain e_1,…,e_{K−2} and a c-over-b final with strict slack γ. Then there exists another augmentation y′ of no larger mass supported only on c-first and b-first ballots that also realizes the chain and the final.

Proof.
Partition ballots r by their top among each S_j. If for some j, top_{S_j}(r) = e_j, then r increases t_{e_j}(S_j), pushing against feasibility; deleting such mass can only help the chain constraints. Let r be any remaining ballot. Its contribution to the final margin depends only on top_{\{b,c\}}(r). Replace r by an equal mass of c-first ballots if top_{\{b,c\}}(r) = c and b-first ballots if it equals b. For every S_j, the replacement affects t_b(S_j) and t_c(S_j) exactly as r does or improves them (since c-first raises only t_c and b-first raises only t_b, never raising any t_{e_j}); thus the chain constraints are preserved or slackened. The final margin is preserved by construction. Iterating over r yields a two-type augmentation with no larger total mass.

Corollary A1 (K=3 exactness as a special case).
When K = 3 and b is the sole opponent besides c, the chain has one element (the unique e_1), and ε_spine(b;γ) equals
B_γ + max{A_γ, B_γ + D_γ}, with A_γ = [p_a − p_c + γ]_+, B_γ = [p_a − p_b + γ]_+, D_γ = t_b({b,c}) − t_c({b,c}) + γ, reproducing the exact formula ε^*(γ;c) = min_b ε_spine(b;γ) and ε^*(c) = lim_{γ→0^+} ε^*(γ;c).

Theorem B (Sampling for the chain certificate under stability).
Fix b and γ > 0. Let the true chain be S_1^*,…,S_{K−1}^* with minima e_j^*. Define the empirical chain \hat S_1,…,\hat S_{K−1} with minima \hat e_j by replacing t with \hat t (ties broken by the same rule). Let the empirical gaps
\hat g_j := min_{x∈\hat S_j\{\hat e_j}} \hat t_x(\hat S_j) − \hat t_{\hat e_j}(\hat S_j).
Suppose m samples yield sup-norm error ≤ τ simultaneously for all quantities \hat t_x(S) that we evaluate below. If \hat g_j ≥ 4τ for all j, then S_j^* = \hat S_j and e_j^* = \hat e_j for all j. Moreover, setting
\hat A_b(γ) := max_j [\hat t_{\hat e_j}(\hat S_j) − \hat t_c(\hat S_j) + γ]_+,
\hat B_b(γ) := max_j [\hat t_{\hat e_j}(\hat S_j) − \hat t_b(\hat S_j) + γ]_+,
\hat D_{b,c}(γ) := \hat t_b({b,c}) − \hat t_c({b,c}) + γ,
and choosing α = \hat A_b(γ) + 2τ, β = \hat B_b(γ) + 2τ, and enforcing α − β ≥ \hat D_{b,c}(γ) + 2τ, we have that (α,β) satisfies the true chain constraints with slack ≥ γ (and a final margin ≥ γ) with probability ≥ 1 − δ. Consequently, if \hat ε_spine(b;γ) := \hat B_b(γ) + max{\hat A_b(γ), \hat B_b(γ) + \hat D_{b,c}(γ)} ≤ ε − 4τ, the decision “c is an ε-winner via b” is correct with probability at least 1 − δ.

Proof.
- Chain stability: If sup error ≤ τ, then for each j the true minimal satisfies t_{e_j^*}(S_j^*) ≤ \hat t_{e_j^*}(\hat S_j) + τ ≤ \hat t_{\hat e_j}(\hat S_j) + τ, while any x ∈ \hat S_j\{\hat e_j} has t_x(S_j^*) ≥ \hat t_x(\hat S_j) − τ ≥ \hat t_{\hat e_j}(\hat S_j) + (\hat g_j − τ) ≥ \hat t_{\hat e_j}(\hat S_j) + 3τ. Hence t_{e_j^*}(S_j^*) < t_x(S_j^*) for all x ≠ e_j^*, forcing e_j^* = \hat e_j and S_j^* = \hat S_j by induction on j.
- Feasibility margin: For each j,
[t_{e_j^*}(S_j^*) − t_c(S_j^*)] − [\hat t_{\hat e_j}(\hat S_j) − \hat t_c(\hat S_j)] ≤ 2τ,
[t_{e_j^*}(S_j^*) − t_b(S_j^*)] − [\hat t_{\hat e_j}(\hat S_j) − \hat t_b(\hat S_j)] ≤ 2τ,
and [t_b({b,c}) − t_c({b,c})] − [\hat t_b({b,c}) − \hat t_c({b,c})] ≤ 2τ. Therefore, adding 2τ to \hat A_b, \hat B_b, and \hat D_{b,c} ensures the true constraints hold with slack γ. Minimizing α+β at the empirical level and adding 2τ to each of α,β yields a sound certificate margin 4τ.
- Sample size: We evaluate O(K^2) tallies: for each j, \hat t_x(\hat S_j) for x ∈ \hat S_j, and the final pair {b,c}. Hoeffding plus a union bound gives m = Θ((log(K) + log(1/δ))/τ^2).

Remark.
The stability condition \hat g_j ≥ 4τ is checkable from data; when it holds, we avoid exponential union bounds. If it fails, we can fall back to the distribution-free c-first certificate or to evaluating a small menu of alternative pivots b.

Theorem C (Exactness under monotone minimality; special case for K ≥ 4).
Fix b and assume the chain e_1,…,e_{K−2} satisfies a uniform gap condition: for each j and each x ∈ S_j\{b,c,e_j}, t_x(S_j) ≥ t_{e_j}(S_j) + θ for some θ > 0. Then for any α,β ≥ 0, the identities of the minima in S_j remain e_j (i.e., minimality is monotone under α c-first and β b-first additions). Consequently, among all augmentations that realize this same elimination order and a c-over-b final with slack γ, the minimal mass equals ε_spine(b;γ).

Proof.
The gap condition freezes the minima among candidates other than {b,c}; adding α,β only raises t_b and t_c, so the unique minimal in S_j remains e_j regardless of α,β. By the cleanup lemma, any augmentation realizing this order can be replaced by a two-type augmentation of no larger mass. The two-type minimization was solved explicitly in Theorem A, yielding optimal mass ε_spine(b;γ).

Obstacles and clarifications
- Fixed-order LP dual sensitivity: Previous attempts (including ours) to bound sup_{λ∈Λ} ||λ||_1 by O(K) erroneously dropped the negative contributions at j = pos_π(x) in the dual constraints. Keeping them shows that summing “champion” constraints cancels, giving no nontrivial bound. Bounding sup ||λ||_1 remains open. Two avenues: (i) construct round-wise test rankings that upper bound ||λ||_1 via a packing argument over constraints; (ii) primal “repair” schemes under strict feasibility margins for v(b), yielding local Lipschitzness without global dual bounds.
- Two-type suboptimality for K ≥ 4 (global optimum): While Theorem A is sufficient (and exact in special cases), we expect instances where the global minimal augmentation uses ≥ 3 ballot types to steer the process into a cheaper elimination path not aligned with any pivot-b chain. Constructing such an explicit coherent example (consistent across all S) is left open.

Examples (sketchable checks)
- K = 3: The counterexample in the notes (a=0.38, b=0.35, c=0.27; c beats b by 0.10, loses to a by 0.20) yields A_0=0.11, B_0=0.03, D_0=−0.10, and ε_a^*(0) = 0.03 + max{0.11, −0.07} = 0.14 < the c-first 0.20; this is captured by Theorem A with K=3.
- Chain-stability diagnostic: In synthetic data, if empirical minima gaps along the chain exceed, say, 5τ, the identities of e_j stabilize; plugging empirical A,B,D with a 4τ margin yields a valid certificate at sample size m ≈ c (log K + log(1/δ)) / τ^2.

Next steps
- Add Theorem A (full statement, proof, cleanup lemma) and Theorem B (sampling under chain-stability) to proofs.md; a concise statement of ε_spine(b;γ) and its K=3 specialization goes to output.md.
- Attempt to build a K=4 coherent counterexample where two-type certificates are loose by solving the fixed-order LP numerically and inspecting optimal supports.
- Explore local sensitivity of v(b) at strictly feasible b via primal repair: quantify additional mass needed to restore γ-slack after a perturbation of size τ in t_a(S_j) − t_{π(j)}(S_j).
- Lower bounds: Formalize a Fano/packing family parameterized by the favorable pivot b ∈ C\{c}, with pairwise perturbations of magnitude Θ(ε) and KL distances O(ε^2), to show Ω((log K)/ε^2) samples are necessary to reliably identify a pivot leading to an ε-winner.
- Data-driven hybrid certifier: compute (i) c-first certificate, (ii) K=3 exact ε^* for each triple {b,c,x}, (iii) chain-based ε_spine(b;γ) for pivots b passing the stability test; output the smallest. Prove a unified sampling guarantee via union bounds over O(K^2) quantities and data-dependent margins.

Minor note on constants (K=3 plug-in): The map (p_a,p_b,p_c,t_c({b,c}),t_c({a,c})) ↦ ε^*(γ;c) is 6-Lipschitz under sup-norm perturbations. Choosing τ = ε/12 yields m = Θ((log(1/δ))/ε^2) for a safe plug-in decision with margin 2Lτ = ε.

Ideas
- Formalize and prove the general-K chain-based two-type certificate (pivot b) with γ-slack and its exact two-type optimal cost B + max{A, B + D}. This provides a sound, efficiently checkable sufficient condition using only O(K^2) tallies from the chain sets S_j and the final pair.
- Give a clean sampling corollary: Hoeffding + union bound over O(K^2) tallies; plug-in stability with a safe Lipschitz constant 6 for the cost map, yielding m = Θ((log K + log(1/δ))/ε^2) to certify using the chain certificate.
- Record corrections: (i) the fixed-order LP dual sensitivity sup||λ||_1 remains open; previous attempted bounds (≤K or ≤K−1) were invalid due to the negative terms, (ii) for K=3 the safe Lipschitz constant is L ≤ 6 (not 3).

General-K chain-based two-type certificate (precise statement and proof)
Setup. Let C be the candidate set, |C| = K ≥ 3. For any nonempty S ⊆ C and a ∈ S, let t_a(S) = Pr[top among S is a] under the baseline population distribution P over full rankings. Fix a target c ∈ C and a pivot b ∈ C \ {c}. Fix a deterministic tie-breaking rule and a slack γ > 0 to enforce strict separations.

Define a chain of remaining sets by S_1 := C, and for j = 1,…,K−2:
- Let e_j ∈ argmin_{e ∈ S_j \ {b,c}} t_e(S_j), with ties broken by the election’s tie-breaking rule; set S_{j+1} := S_j \ {e_j}.
Intuition: e_j is the “baseline round-j loser among non-{b,c}” on S_j.

Define the thresholds
- A_b(γ) := max_{1 ≤ j ≤ K−2} [ t_{e_j}(S_j) − t_c(S_j) + γ ]_+,
- B_b(γ) := max_{1 ≤ j ≤ K−2} [ t_{e_j}(S_j) − t_b(S_j) + γ ]_+,
- D_{b,c}(γ) := t_b({b,c}) − t_c({b,c}) + γ.

Consider augmentations that add only two ballot types: α ≥ 0 mass of c-first rankings and β ≥ 0 mass of b-first rankings (the completions below the top are arbitrary but fixed). Let ε_b^{chain}(γ) be the minimal α+β that ensures the following IRV outcome under the augmented profile: the election eliminates e_1,…,e_{K−2} in this order and the final is c vs b with c strictly beating b by margin ≥ γ.

Theorem (chain-based two-type certificate and exact two-type optimum). For any fixed b ≠ c and γ > 0:
1) Feasibility: If α ≥ A_b(γ), β ≥ B_b(γ), and α − β ≥ D_{b,c}(γ), then under the augmented profile, in round j the candidate e_j is eliminated (with strict margin to both b and c), and in the final c strictly beats b; consequently c wins. Hence any ε ≥ B_b(γ) + max{A_b(γ), B_b(γ) + D_{b,c}(γ)} suffices to make c the winner via two-type additions.
2) Optimality within two types: Among augmentations using only c-first and b-first ballots, the minimal total mass achieving the above outcome equals
   ε_b^{chain}(γ) = B_b(γ) + max{A_b(γ), B_b(γ) + D_{b,c}(γ)}.

Proof.
Effect of two types. A c-first ballot contributes +1 to t_c(S) for every S with c ∈ S, and leaves t_a(S) unchanged for a ≠ c. A b-first ballot symmetrically contributes +1 to t_b(S) for S containing b and leaves others unchanged. In particular, for every j ≤ K−2 (so S_j contains both b and c), we have
  t'_c(S_j) = t_c(S_j) + α,  t'_b(S_j) = t_b(S_j) + β, and t'_{e_j}(S_j) = t_{e_j}(S_j).
Moreover, in the final S = {b,c}, t'_c(S) − t'_b(S) = (t_c(S) − t_b(S)) + (α − β).

Feasibility. By the definitions of A_b and B_b,
  α ≥ A_b(γ) ⇒ t'_c(S_j) ≥ t_{e_j}(S_j) + γ for all j,
  β ≥ B_b(γ) ⇒ t'_b(S_j) ≥ t_{e_j}(S_j) + γ for all j.
Therefore at each round j, e_j is (weakly) below all other candidates in S_j, and strictly below both b and c. Since the other candidates’ tallies in S_j are unchanged and e_j was chosen as the argmin among S_j \ {b,c} (with the same tie-breaking), e_j is the unique eliminated (ties, if any among S_j \ {b,c}, resolve the same way as at baseline; strict gaps to b and c ensure e_j is still the minimum). After eliminating e_1,…,e_{K−2}, the final is between b and c. If in addition α − β ≥ D_{b,c}(γ), then t'_c({b,c}) ≥ t'_b({b,c}) + γ, so c strictly wins the final. Hence the stated inequalities are sufficient and the total mass α+β at any feasible point is an upper bound on ε.

Optimal two-type cost. The feasible region in (α,β)-space is
  { (α,β) ∈ R_+^2 : α ≥ A_b(γ), β ≥ B_b(γ), α − β ≥ D_{b,c}(γ) }.
This is a convex polyhedron. Minimizing α+β over it is achieved by taking β = B_b(γ) and α = max{A_b(γ), B_b(γ) + D_{b,c}(γ)} (any larger β enlarges α+β; any α below A_b violates feasibility; if A_b ≤ B_b + D then the α − β constraint is tight, otherwise α = A_b). Thus ε_b^{chain}(γ) equals the claimed expression. ∎

Remarks.
- This certificate depends only on the tallies t_x(S_j) for the chain sets S_j (j = 1,…,K−2) and the pairwise tallies on {b,c}. Computing the chain e_1,…,e_{K−2} uses the same deterministic tie-breaking as the election profile.
- Dominance: For this targeted chain and final, any added ballot not topping b or c in S_j weakly worsens feasibility constraints at round j (it cannot lower t_{e_j}(S_j) and does not increase t_b(S_j) or t_c(S_j)), hence it is never needed in an optimal two-type plan for this chain.

Sampling corollary for the chain-based certificate
Define, for fixed c and b, the cost map
  Φ_b(P; γ) := B_b(γ) + max{A_b(γ), B_b(γ) + D_{b,c}(γ)}.
Let 𝒯_b be the multiset of tallies comprising, for j = 1,…,K−2, the triple (t_{e_j}(S_j), t_b(S_j), t_c(S_j)) and the pairwise (t_b({b,c}), t_c({b,c})). Note e_j depends on S_j’s full tally vector and the fixed tie-breaker; in sampling we compute e_j from estimates (and enforce a safety slack γ).

Lemma (uniform estimation over the chain tallies). For m i.i.d. ballots and any τ > 0, with probability at least 1 − δ, we have
  sup_{x ∈ 𝒯_b} |\hat t_x − t_x| ≤ τ
whenever m ≥ c · (log(2|𝒯_b|/δ))/τ^2 for a universal constant c. Here |𝒯_b| ≤ 3(K−2) + 2 = O(K).

Proof. Hoeffding’s inequality for each tally and a union bound over |𝒯_b|.

Proposition (plug-in stability and sample complexity). The map Φ_b(·; γ) is Lipschitz with constant at most 6 in the sup norm over the entries of 𝒯_b: for any two profiles P, Q,
  |Φ_b(P; γ) − Φ_b(Q; γ)| ≤ 6 · sup_{x ∈ 𝒯_b} |t_x^P − t_x^Q|.
Consequently, if m ≥ c (log(2|𝒯_b|/δ))/τ^2 and we declare c a certified ε-winner via pivot b whenever \hat Φ_b ≤ ε − 6τ, then with probability ≥ 1 − δ the declaration is sound (c is an ε-winner).

Proof. Each difference t_{e_j}(S_j) − t_c(S_j) and t_{e_j}(S_j) − t_b(S_j) perturbs by at most 2τ under sup-norm τ perturbations of the inputs; taking positive part and a maximum over j preserves 2-Lipschitzness, so A_b and B_b are each 2-Lipschitz. The pairwise gap D_{b,c} is also 2-Lipschitz. The map (B, A, D) ↦ B + max{A, B + D} has Lipschitz constant ≤ 1 + max{1, 1 + 1} = 3 with respect to sup norm on (A, B, D). Composing gives ≤ 3·2 = 6 overall. The acceptance margin then follows.

Corollary (choosing the pivot b). Since there are K − 1 choices of b ≠ c, a union bound adds only log(K) to the sample complexity. Declare c certified if min_{b≠c} \hat Φ_b ≤ ε − 6τ; with m ≥ c (log(2K|𝒯_b|/δ))/τ^2 and τ = Θ(ε), this certifies c with probability ≥ 1 − δ whenever min_b Φ_b ≤ ε.

Connections and consistency checks
- K = 3: The chain has a single j (K−2 = 1) and recovers exactly the two-type closed form previously established: ε^*(γ; c) = min_{b≠c} Φ_b(P; γ). The safe plug-in Lipschitz constant is 6.
- Soundness vs. first-round-only claims: The chain certificate crucially uses t_x(S_j) on the actual S_j; replacing these by first-round shares p_x can be arbitrarily wrong (see the verifier’s K=4 counterexample where post-transfer t_b(S) = 0.40 far exceeds p_b).

Obstacles (LP dual sensitivity remains open)
- For a fixed elimination order π, the primal LP and its dual are correct as recorded in the notes. The dual constraint for a ranking r includes negative terms −∑_{a} λ_{j,a} when top_{S_j}(r) = π(j). Attempting to bound sup||λ||_1 by summing constraints over special r that place a fixed candidate first fails: the negative block at j = pos_π(·) cancels when one sums over candidates, yielding no nontrivial bound. Any future bound must leverage constraints for families of rankings r where the negative blocks are controlled jointly rather than naïvely dropped.

Examples (sanity check instance for the chain certificate)
Construct K=4 with C={a,b,c,d}, target c, pivot b. Suppose
- First round: t({a,b,c,d}) = (0.33, 0.30, 0.27, 0.10).
- After removing d: t({a,b,c}) = (0.41, 0.31, 0.28).
- Final pair: t_c({b,c}) − t_b({b,c}) = 0.02.
Chain (excluding {b,c}): S_1={a,b,c,d}, e_1=d; S_2={a,b,c}, e_2=a. Then
  A_b(0) = max{ [0.10−0.27]_+, [0.41−0.28]_+ } = 0.13,
  B_b(0) = max{ [0.10−0.30]_+, [0.41−0.31]_+ } = 0.10,
  D_{b,c}(0) = −0.02.
Thus Φ_b(P; 0) = 0.10 + max{0.13, 0.08} = 0.23. Adding α=0.13 of c-first and β=0.10 of b-first ballots ensures elimination of d then a and a c-over-b final, for total mass 0.23. This illustrates how the chain-based certificate exploits the relevant S_j tallies beyond first-round shares.

Next steps
- Add the chain-based certificate theorem and sampling corollary (with L ≤ 6) to proofs.md and output.md. Keep the K=3 exact minimal-augmentation result and its sampling bound.
- Computational search for separations: formulate a bilevel program that (i) chooses a small-support ranking distribution P (over, say, ≤10 ranking types) to maximize the gap between true minimal augmentation and min_b Φ_b(P; 0), and (ii) searches over augmentations with 2 vs. 3 types. This can produce concrete K≥4 instances where a third ballot type strictly reduces the required mass vs. any pivot-b two-type plan.
- Dual sensitivity: explore averaging arguments over carefully chosen families of rankings that keep the negative dual terms bounded in aggregate, potentially yielding order-dependent bounds sup||λ||_1 = poly(K) (e.g., O(K^2)). Any such bound would convert per-order LP certification into a polynomial-sample scheme.
- Lower bounds: pursue a Fano-style packing over pivots b (hiding the favorable opponent among K−1) to show a necessary Ω((log K)/ε^2) factor for certifying an ε-winner in the worst case.

# Ideas

- Prove a general necessary lower bound that depends only on round‑1 (S=C) deficits and the final c vs b head‑to‑head margin. Why useful: it cleanly separates the unavoidable first‑round survival cost from any path-specific requirements and matches the exact K=3 cost; it also lower-bounds any chain-based certificate for K≥4.
- Give a precise two-stage sampling guarantee for the chain-based (pivot-b) certificate under a simple separation condition and with sample-splitting. Why useful: yields a polynomial-in-K, distribution-dependent (via the separation) sample bound with a crisp proof.
- Sharpen the counting for the c-first certificate’s uniform convergence (reduce the function-class cardinality factor). Why useful: slightly improves constants and clarifies what must be estimated when certifying a fixed c.

# A necessary lower bound for any augmentation achieving the final pair {b,c}

Notation. For S=C and any x, write p_x := t_x(C). Let p_min^{(b,c)} := min_{x∈C\{b,c}} p_x. Fix γ>0 for strictness and D_{b,c}(γ) := t_b({b,c}) − t_c({b,c}) + γ. Define the round‑1 deficits
- A^{(1)}_b(γ) := [ p_min^{(b,c)} − p_c + γ ]_+,
- B^{(1)}_b(γ) := [ p_min^{(b,c)} − p_b + γ ]_+.

Theorem (Round‑1 + final lower bound). Fix c and b≠c. Let y be any nonnegative measure on rankings added to the baseline profile such that IRV (with the fixed tie‑breaking) produces a final between {b,c} and c strictly beats b in that final by margin ≥γ. Then the total mass ∥y∥_1 satisfies
  ∥y∥_1 ≥ L_b(γ) := B^{(1)}_b(γ) + max{ A^{(1)}_b(γ), B^{(1)}_b(γ) + D_{b,c}(γ) }.
Moreover, equality is attained for K=3.

Proof. Partition y into y_c (top_C = c), y_b (top_C = b), and y_rest; write α=∥y_c∥_1, β=∥y_b∥_1, and ϑ=∥y_rest∥_1. To ensure neither c nor b is eliminated in round 1, we must have
  p_c + α ≥ p_min^{(b,c)} + γ and p_b + β ≥ p_min^{(b,c)} + γ,
which are necessary, so α ≥ A^{(1)}_b(γ), β ≥ B^{(1)}_b(γ). In the final {b,c}, the updated margin is
  (t_c({b,c}) − t_b({b,c})) + (α − β) + (θ_c − θ_b),
where θ_c (resp., θ_b) is the contribution of y_rest to c (resp., b) in the pair {b,c}. Since θ_c − θ_b ≤ ϑ, the strict win by ≥γ implies α − β + ϑ ≥ D_{b,c}(γ). Minimizing α+β+ϑ subject to α ≥ A, β ≥ B, α − β + ϑ ≥ D is a 2D polyhedral problem with optimum B + max{A, B + D}, achieved at β = B and α = max{A, B + D − ϑ} with ϑ chosen to meet the final constraint tightly. Substituting A=A^{(1)}_b(γ), B=B^{(1)}_b(γ), D=D_{b,c}(γ) proves the bound. For K=3, later rounds impose no additional constraints beyond round 1 and the final, and the standard two‑type construction (c‑first and b‑first) or its variant using y_rest to assist the final achieves equality.

Corollary (Consistency with K=3 exact formula). For K=3 and fixed b, L_b(γ) equals the exact minimal augmentation for the strategy “eliminate the third candidate first and then elect c over b,” hence ε^*(γ;c) = min_{b≠c} L_b(γ).

Corollary (Lower bound against any chain-based certificate). For K≥4 and any pivot b, the chain‑based two‑type certificate cost ε_b^*(γ) = B_b(γ) + max{A_b(γ), B_b(γ) + D_{b,c}(γ)} satisfies ε_b^*(γ) ≥ L_b(γ) because A_b(γ) ≥ A^{(1)}_b(γ) and B_b(γ) ≥ B^{(1)}_b(γ) by definition (the chain includes S_1=C). Thus L_b(γ) is a universal benchmark; any strict gap ε_b^*(γ) − L_b(γ) quantifies room for improvement via path changes (potentially requiring additional ballot types).

# Sampling the chain-based certificate under separation (polynomial in K)

Separation condition. Fix c and pivot b. Let the baseline chain be S_1=C, and for j=1,…,K−2 pick e_j ∈ argmin_{e∈S_j\{b,c}} t_e(S_j) with the election’s deterministic tie‑breaking, S_{j+1}=S_j\{e_j}. Define the round‑j “gap” between the loser and the second loser among S_j\{b,c} as
  μ_j := min_{x∈S_j\{b,c,e_j}} ( t_x(S_j) − t_{e_j}(S_j) ), and let μ := min_j μ_j.
Assume μ>0.

Algorithm (sample-split).
- Stage 1 (chain identification). Draw m_1 i.i.d. ballots. For j=1,…,K−2, compute empirical tallies on S_j^hat (starting S_1^hat=C) and set e_j^hat to the empirical argmin over S_j^hat\{b,c} (using the official tie‑breaking); set S_{j+1}^hat=S_j^hat\{e_j^hat}.
- Stage 2 (deficits on the chain). Independently draw m_2 ballots. Estimate t_c(S_j), t_b(S_j), t_{e_j}(S_j) for j=1,…,K−2, and t_c({b,c}), t_b({b,c}). Form A_b(γ), B_b(γ), D_{b,c}(γ) and the certificate ε_b^*(γ).
- Decision. Option 1: Fix b in advance (e.g., scan all b via a union bound). Option 2: Choose \hat b minimizing the plug‑in ε_b^*(γ) across b∈C\{c}.

Guarantee. There exist absolute constants c_1,c_2 such that:
- m_1 ≥ c_1 μ^{-2} log( (K−2)/δ ) ensures P( e_j^hat = e_j ∀j ) ≥ 1−δ/2, since each step’s misidentification needs a deviation ≥ μ/2 and there are ≤K−2 steps.
- Conditional on Stage 1 success, if m_2 ≥ c_2 τ^{-2} log( (3(K−2)+2)/δ ), then with probability ≥1−δ/2 all estimates of the 3(K−2)+2 needed tallies are within ±τ. Because the map (these tallies) ↦ ε_b^*(γ) is 1‑Lipschitz in each argument and piecewise linear with l_1‑subgradients of norm ≤ 3 (for A,B) and ≤ 1 (for D inside the max), we can take a global sup‑norm Lipschitz constant L≤6. Hence |\widehat{ε}_b^*(γ) − ε_b^*(γ)| ≤ Lτ.
- Taking a union bound over b (K−1 choices) multiplies the Stage 2 logarithmic factor by at most log(K−1).
Thus with m_1 = O(μ^{-2} log(K/δ)) and m_2 = O(τ^{-2} log(K/δ)), the procedure certifies any b for which ε_b^*(γ) ≤ ε − Lτ with probability ≥ 1−δ. Choosing τ=Θ(ε) yields m_2=Θ((log(K/δ))/ε^2).

Remarks.
- When μ is tiny, Stage 1 is unstable; a safe fallback is the distribution‑free c‑first certificate M_c with uniform convergence (exponential in K but no separation needed).
- For K=3, μ is vacuous (there is only one step) and the result reduces to the known Θ((log(1/δ))/ε^2) sampling bound using five tallies.

# Slight sharpening for the c-first certificate’s union bound

Lemma (counting). For a fixed target c, the number of indicator functions of the form r ↦ 1[top_S(r)=a] with c∈S and a∈S\{c} equals
  N_c = ∑_{s=2}^K C(K−1, s−1) (s−1) = (K−1) 2^{K−2}.
Proof. For each subset size s, choose the s−1 companions of c in C(K−1, s−1) ways and then the winner a among the s−1 non‑c elements.

Consequently, for certifying a fixed c via M_c, Hoeffding + union bound over N_c indicators yields m = O( (log N_c + log(1/δ))/τ^2 ) = O( ((K−1) + log(1/δ))/τ^2 ) with the 2^{K−2} factor entering only inside the logarithm. This modestly improves the constant hidden in the big‑O compared to a crude K·2^{K−1} count.

# Examples and checks

- K=3 exactness via lower bound: With p_a=0.38, p_b=0.35, p_c=0.27, and t_c({b,c})−t_b({b,c})=0.10, picking b as the pivot and γ→0 yields A^{(1)}=0.11, B^{(1)}=0.03, D=−0.10, hence L_b(0)=0.03+max{0.11, −0.07}=0.14, matching the exact ε_a^* from the notes. The lower bound is tight.
- Chain vs. lower bound gap (schematic): For K≥4, if along the baseline chain some later-round minimum t_{e_j}(S_j) greatly exceeds p_min^{(b,c)}, then A_b(γ) or B_b(γ) can be much larger than A^{(1)}_b(γ), B^{(1)}_b(γ). The lower bound L_b(γ) detects only the unavoidable round‑1 and final costs; any strict gap ε_b^*(γ)−L_b(γ) suggests a potential for mixed‑type additions that alter the path (e.g., using “rest” ballots to steer eliminations) and possibly approach L_b(γ). Constructing an explicit tight example remains to be done (see Obstacles/Next steps).

# Obstacles

- Explicit K≥4 separation example. While L_b(γ) ≤ ε_b^*(γ) always holds, producing a concrete P and an explicit mixed‑type augmentation y that achieves a total mass strictly below ε_b^*(γ) (hence close to L_b(γ)) requires careful control so that the “rest” ballots do not increase later minima enough to force larger α or β. This is delicate because added ballots may change multiple round‑j minima simultaneously.
- Fixed‑order LP sensitivity. The dual‑norm bound sup_{λ∈Λ} ∥λ∥_1 remains open; naive summation arguments fail due to the negative term at j = pos_π(x). Progress likely needs either a structured dual construction with per‑round normalization or a relaxation that preserves value up to a small factor with provable Lipschitzness.

# Next steps

- Add the Round‑1 + final lower bound (Theorem) and its K=3 tightness corollary to proofs.md; this clarifies what is fundamentally unavoidable in any augmentation targeting a specific final opponent.
- Pursue an explicit K=4 instance with a strict chain vs. lower‑bound gap and construct a three‑type augmentation that achieves a cost below the chain certificate (but above the lower bound), validating the role of path alterations.
- Extend the two‑stage sampling theorem to the “min over b” selection, with an explicit union‑bound accounting for at most (K−1)(3(K−2)+2)=O(K^2) tallies.
- Explore whether additional structural conditions (e.g., bounded transfer volatility across S_j) imply that ε_b^*(γ) equals L_b(γ) for some b, yielding near‑exact certificates beyond K=3.
- Lower bounds: formalize a Fano/packing family {P_i} over i∈[K] where exactly one candidate i is an ε‑winner and the P_i are pairwise close (KL=Θ(ε^2)), giving m = Ω((log K)/ε^2) for the general problem. The construction can key off small independent perturbations of c vs i head‑to‑head and the round‑1 minima while keeping all other statistics equal up to O(ε).
