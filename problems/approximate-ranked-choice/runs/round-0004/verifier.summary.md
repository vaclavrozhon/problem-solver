We validated and formalized a general-K chain-based two-type certificate (fix pivot b, follow the minimal-of-others chain, cost ε = B_b + max{A_b, B_b + D_{b,c}}), exact for K=3 and efficiently checkable. We added a chain-stability lemma and a sample-splitting sampling guarantee with margin 6τ, yielding m = Θ((log K + log(1/δ))/ε^2) under verifiable gaps. We also proved a general necessary lower bound L_b(γ) (round-1 + final), tight for K=3 and lower-bounding the chain certificate. The fixed-order LP dual-norm bound remains open; earlier K or K−1 claims are invalid. Next: formalize a Ω((log K)/ε^2) lower bound via Fano and exhibit a K≥4 instance where ≥3 types strictly beat the two-type bound.
