  "content": "# Ideas\n- Provide an explicit K = 4 ranking profile where the chain-based two-type certificate (min over pivots) requires \u03b5 \u2265 0.15, yet a three-type augmentation (c-first and a-first only) makes c win with total mass \u2248 0.12. This cleanly separates two-type from optimal, showing two-type is not tight for K \u2265 4.\n- Use a small set of ranking types to ensure all required top-of-S tallies and pairwise tallies are internally consistent.\n- Outline a general \u201cfew-type LP\u201d approach: for a fixed targeted elimination chain and a chosen small set of added-top types T, the minimal augmentation is a low-dimensional LP; this offers a path to improved certificates beyond two-type.\n\n# Example and Proposition (Two-type is suboptimal for K = 4)\nFix C = {a,b,c,d} and target c. Consider the following full-ranking distribution (probabilities sum to 1):\n- A_b: 0.06 on a \u227b b \u227b d \u227b c\n- A_d: 0.12 on a \u227b d \u227b c \u227b b\n- B:   0.35 on b \u227b a \u227b c \u227b d\n- C:   0.22 on c \u227b b \u227b d \u227b a\n- D_c: 0.085 on d \u227b c \u227b b \u227b a\n- D_a: 0.05 on d \u227b a \u227b c \u227b b\n- D_b: 0.115 on d \u227b b \u227b c \u227b a\nCompute relevant tallies:\n- First round S1 = C: (t_a,t_b,t_c,t_d) = (0.18, 0.35, 0.22, 0.25).\n- Second round S2 = {b,c,d}: t_b(S2) = 0.35 + 0.06 = 0.41; t_c(S2) = 0.22; t_d(S2) = 0.12 + 0.25 = 0.37.\n- Alternate second round S2\u2032 = {a,b,c}: t_a(S2\u2032) = 0.06 + 0.12 + 0.05 = 0.23; t_b(S2\u2032) = 0.35 + 0.115 = 0.465; t_c(S2\u2032) = 0.22 + 0.085 = 0.305.\n- Pairwise c vs b: t_c({b,c}) = 0.12 + 0.22 + 0.085 + 0.05 = 0.475; hence D_{b,c} = t_b \u2212 t_c = 0.525 \u2212 0.475 = 0.05.\n\nChain-based two-type certificate, pivot b.\n- Baseline chain: e1 = a (since min{a,d} = a), S2 = {b,c,d} and e2 = d.\n- A_b(0) = max{ [0.18 \u2212 0.22]_+, [0.37 \u2212 0.22]_+ } = 0.15.\n- B_b(0) = max{ [0.18 \u2212 0.35]_+, [0.37 \u2212 0.41]_+ } = 0.\n- D_{b,c}(0) = 0.05. Thus \u03b5_b^{(2)}(0; c) = 0 + max{0.15, 0.05} = 0.15.\nOther pivots are worse: pivot d gives \u03b5_d^{(2)} = 0.04 + max{0.19, 0.04 \u2212 0.14} = 0.23; pivot a is \u2265 0.63 (details in Obstacles/Checks). Hence min_b \u03b5_b^{(2)} = 0.15.\n\nThree-type augmentation beating \u03b5_b^{(2)}.\nAdd \u03b1 of c-first and \u03b2_a of a-first ballots (no b-first). Choose \u03b2_a = 0.0701 and \u03b1 = 0.0501. Then:\n- Round 1 (S1): a\u2032 = 0.18 + \u03b2_a \u2248 0.2501, c\u2032 = 0.22 + \u03b1 \u2248 0.2701, b\u2032 = 0.35, d\u2032 = 0.25. The unique minimum is d (0.25), so d is eliminated.\n- Round 2 (S2\u2032 = {a,b,c}): a\u2032(S2\u2032) = 0.23 + \u03b2_a \u2248 0.3001, b\u2032(S2\u2032) = 0.465, c\u2032(S2\u2032) = 0.305 + \u03b1 \u2248 0.3551. Thus a is eliminated.\n- Final (c vs b): t\u2032_c({b,c}) \u2212 t\u2032_b({b,c}) = (0.475 + \u03b1) \u2212 0.525 = \u03b1 \u2212 0.05 > 0 by choice of \u03b1. Hence c wins with strict margins.\nTotal mass \u03b1 + \u03b2_a \u2248 0.1202 < 0.15. Therefore, the two-type certificate is not tight for K \u2265 4.\n\nProof sketch completeness.\n- All tallies used follow from the explicit ranking distribution; the subset tallies are computed as the probability that the listed ranking places the designated candidate top among the subset. Pairwise tallies use the usual \u201cc above b\u201d counts.\n- The three-type feasibility constraints are the standard linear IRV round inequalities on the affected subsets; we verified each round\u2019s strict separations and the final pairwise win.\n- Minimality of two-type for pivot b follows from the chain-based theorem: within two types {c,b}, the minimum equals B_b + max{A_b, B_b + D_{b,c}} = 0.15.\n\n# Obstacles and checks\n- Why two-type fails: Here c\u2019s binding deficit is at S2 = {b,c,d}, where d has 0.37 while c has 0.22, driving A_b = 0.15. Steering the first elimination to remove d (by adding a-first ballots) avoids this large deficit and yields a cheaper path even after accounting for the final pairwise deficit.\n- Soundness of calculations: we checked all relevant subset tallies (S1, S2, S2\u2032) and pairwise c vs b; other pivots (a, d) give higher two-type costs (pivot a: A_a = max{0.25\u22120.22, 0.465\u22120.305} = 0.16, B_a = max{0.25\u22120.18, 0.465\u22120.23} = 0.235, D_{a,c} = 0.58\u22120.42 = 0.16, so \u03b5_a^{(2)} = 0.235 + max{0.16, 0.395} = 0.63; pivot d: computed above as 0.23).\n- Generalization: Optimizing over three (or a few) added-top types for a fixed targeted chain is a small LP with linear constraints whose number scales with the chain length; this suggests a tractable family of improved certificates beyond two-type.\n\n# Next steps\n- Formalize a \u201cfew-type targeted-chain LP\u201d certificate: for a chosen pivot y and a steering set T \u2286 C\\{y,c}, solve min \u2211_{t\u2208T\u222a{c,y}} x_t subject to per-round linear inequalities on the chain (with \u03b3-slack) and the final pairwise constraint; minimize over small T (e.g., |T| \u2264 1 or 2). Prove a Lipschitz sampling bound using the structure of these constraints.\n- Develop a systematic recipe to search for steering candidates s that can reduce the dominant deficit round (like S2 above) with minimal collateral increases elsewhere.\n- Sampling: For a fixed plan (chain and T), only O(K) subset tallies on the chain plus O(|T|) pairwise tallies are needed; use Hoeffding + union bound with m = \u0398((log K + log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2) and a margin \u2265 6\u03c4 as in prior lemmas.\n- Lower bounds: Extend the \u03a9((log K)/\u03b5^2) construction to a family where two-type is suboptimal but few-type is exact, stressing the necessity of searching over steering sets.\n"
