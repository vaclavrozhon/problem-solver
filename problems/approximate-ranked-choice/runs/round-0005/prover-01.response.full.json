Steering the first elimination to remove d (by adding a-first ballots) avoids this large deficit and yields a cheaper path even after accounting for the final pairwise deficit.\\n- Soundness of calculations: we checked all relevant subset tallies (S1, S2, S2\u2032) and pairwise c vs b; other pivots (a, d) give higher two-type costs (pivot a: A_a = max{0.25\u22120.22, 0.465\u22120.305} = 0.16, B_a = max{0.25\u22120.18, 0.465\u22120.23} = 0.235, D_{a,c} = 0.58\u22120.42 = 0.16, so \u03b5_a^{(2)} = 0.235 + max{0.16, 0.395} = 0.63; pivot d: computed above as 0.23).\\n- Generalization: Optimizing over three (or a few) added-top types for a fixed targeted chain is a small LP with linear constraints whose number scales with the chain length; this suggests a tractable family of improved certificates beyond two-type.\\n\\n# Next steps\\n- Formalize a \u201cfew-type targeted-chain LP\u201d certificate: for a chosen pivot y and a steering set T \u2286 C\\\\{y,c}, solve min \u2211_{t\u2208T\u222a{c,y}} x_t subject to per-round linear inequalities on the chain (with \u03b3-slack) and the final pairwise constraint; minimize over small T (e.g., |T| \u2264 1 or 2). Prove a Lipschitz sampling bound using the structure of these constraints.\\n- Develop a systematic recipe to search for steering candidates s that can reduce the dominant deficit round (like S2 above) with minimal collateral increases elsewhere.\\n- Sampling: For a fixed plan (chain and T), only O(K) subset tallies on the chain plus O(|T|) pairwise tallies are needed; use Hoeffding + union bound with m = \u0398((log K + log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2) and a margin \u2265 6\u03c4 as in prior lemmas.\\n- Lower bounds: Extend the \u03a9((log K)/\u03b5^2) construction to a family where two-type is suboptimal but few-type is exact, stressing the necessity of searching over steering sets.\\n\"}",
