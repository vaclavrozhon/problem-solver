This isolates why the two-type polytope captures the exact optimal cost within the targeted chain.\n- Chain-identification under sampling: provide a verifiable gap condition (chain-stability) under which the empirical chain equals the true chain with high probability; combine with sample splitting to yield a polynomial sample-complexity certifier using the chain-based cost \u03a6_b.\n- Necessary lower bound (round-1 + final) with proof: any augmentation producing a {b,c} final and a strict c-over-b win must pay at least B_b^{(1)} + max{A_b^{(1)}, B_b^{(1)} + D_{b,c}}; this is tight for K = 3 and strengthens intuition.\n- Fano-type \u03a9((log K)/\u03b5^2) lower bound sketch: pack K\u22121 distributions indexed by the favorable pivot, differing only in bc pairwise preferences, keeping chain tallies identical. This forces identifying the pivot from m samples.\n- Separation template (K \u2265 4): design profiles where the best two-type chain certificate (for a fixed pivot) exceeds the true minimal augmentation achieved by a 3-type plan that leverages \u201ctop e_1 then c\u201d ballots to shift the final while not inflating early-round tallies.\n\nRigorous statements and proofs\n\nLemma 1 (Cleanup for a fixed chain).\nFix c and pivot b. Let the baseline chain be S_1 = C and, for j = 1,\u2026,K\u22122, e_j = argmin_{e \u2208 S_j \\ {b,c}} t_e(S_j) (with the election\u2019s tie-breaking), and S_{j+1} = S_j \\ {e_j}. Suppose an added distribution y over rankings achieves: (i) in round j, e_j is eliminated from S_j; (ii) in the final {b,c}, c beats b with slack \u03b3 > 0. Then there exists another added distribution y\u2032 with ||y\u2032||_1 \u2264 ||y||_1 supported only on rankings that top c or b, and y\u2032 also achieves (i)\u2013(ii).\n\nProof.\nFor each ranking r in the support of y and each j with |S_j| \u2265 3, if top_{S_j}(r) \u2209 {b,c}, then r contributes nonpositively to both elimination slack constraints at round j: it increases neither t_c(S_j) nor t_b(S_j), while possibly increasing t_{e_j}(S_j) if top_{S_j}(r) = e_j. Removing mass on such r cannot decrease feasibility at round j and (if top_{S_j}(r) = e_j) strictly improves it. For the final {b,c}, the contribution of r to the margin t'_c \u2212 t'_b equals 1 if r ranks c \u227b b and 0 otherwise; thus any positive contribution can be replicated by a c-first ballot, while any negative contribution (ranks b \u227b c) can be replicated by a b-first ballot. Therefore we can iteratively (i) delete mass that tops any e_j on S_j, which weakly improves all chain-round constraints, and (ii) redirect remaining mass to c-first and b-first ballots to preserve the bc final margin and all round-wise increases of t_c and t_b. This produces y\u2032 supported on c-first and b-first with no greater mass and preserving (i)\u2013(ii). \u220e\n\nCorollary 2 (Exact two-type optimality on a fixed chain).\nFor fixed b and chain e_1,\u2026,e_{K\u22122}, the minimal total mass among all augmentations that eliminate exactly e_1,\u2026,e_{K\u22122} in order and then elect c over b with slack \u03b3 equals\n  \u03b5_b^{chain}(\u03b3) = B_b(\u03b3) + max{A_b(\u03b3), B_b(\u03b3) + D_{b,c}(\u03b3)},\nwith A_b, B_b, D_{b,c} as defined in the notes. Proof: combine Lemma 1 with the two-variable LP solved previously.\n\nLemma 3 (Chain-stability under sup-norm errors).\nFix b and chain e_1,\u2026,e_{K\u22122}. Define, for each j,\n- m_j := min_{x \u2208 S_j \\ {e_j}} (t_x(S_j) \u2212 t_{e_j}(S_j)) (strict gap to the next competitor),\n- s_j := min{ t_b(S_j) \u2212 t_{e_j}(S_j), t_c(S_j) \u2212 t_{e_j}(S_j) } (strict gaps to b and c).\nIf sup_{a,S} |\\hat t_a(S) \u2212 t_a(S)| \u2264 \u03c4 and min_j m_j \u2265 2\u03c4 and min_j s_j \u2265 2\u03c4, then the empirical chain \\hat e_j computed from \\hat t (with the same tie-breaking) equals e_j for all j.\n\nProof.\nFor any y \u2208 S_j \\ {e_j}, t_y(S_j) \u2212 t_{e_j}(S_j) \u2265 m_j \u2265 2\u03c4, whence \\hat t_y(S_j) \u2212 \\hat t_{e_j}(S_j) \u2265 m_j \u2212 2\u03c4 \u2265 0; thus e_j remains (tie-broken) argmin in S_j \\ {b,c}. The s_j bound ensures e_j is strictly below b and c in \\hat t, so the chain proceeds identically. \u220e\n\nProposition 4 (Sample-splitting chain certificate).\nFix \u03b5, \u03b4 \u2208 (0,1). For each c and b \u2260 c, run:\n- Phase I (chain identification): draw m_1 ballots to estimate tallies on all S along the evolving empirical chain; if min_j \\hat m_j \u2265 3\u03c4_1 and min_j \\hat s_j \u2265 3\u03c4_1, proceed; else abstain on this (c,b).\n- Phase II (cost evaluation): draw an independent m_2 ballots; estimate only the tallies in \ud835\udcaf_b = { (t_{e_j}(S_j), t_b(S_j), t_c(S_j))_j and (t_b({b,c}), t_c({b,c})) }. Compute \\hat \u03a6_b = \\hat B_b + max{\\hat A_b, \\hat B_b + \\hat D_{b,c}} and certify (c,b) if \\hat \u03a6_b \u2264 \u03b5 \u2212 6\u03c4_2.\nChoose m_1 \u2265 c_1 log(2Q/\u03b4_1)/\u03c4_1^2 with Q \u2264 \u2211_j |S_j| = O(K^2), and m_2 \u2265 c_2 log(2|\ud835\udcaf_b|/\u03b4_2)/\u03c4_2^2 with |\ud835\udcaf_b| = O(K), and allocate \u03b4 = \u03b4_1 + K \u03b4_2. Then with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4, every certified (c,b) is correct (c is an \u03b5-winner). Minimizing over b adds only a log K factor in m_2.\n\nProof.\nBy Hoeffding + union bound, Phase I guarantees sup error \u2264 \u03c4_1 and hence chain stability by Lemma 3; Phase II guarantees sup error \u2264 \u03c4_2 over \ud835\udcaf_b and the 6\u03c4_2 plug-in margin (Lipschitz bound) ensures soundness. Union bound over up to K \u2212 1 pivots. \u220e\n\nProposition 5 (Round-1 + final necessary lower bound).\nFix b \u2260 c and \u03b3 \u2265 0. Any augmentation y that produces a {b,c} final and a strict c-over-b win with slack \u03b3 satisfies\n  ||y||_1 \u2265 B_b^{(1)}(\u03b3) + max{ A_b^{(1)}(\u03b3), B_b^{(1)}(\u03b3) + D_{b,c}(\u03b3) },\nwhere A_b^{(1)}(\u03b3) = [p_min^{(b,c)} \u2212 p_c + \u03b3]_+, B_b^{(1)}(\u03b3) = [p_min^{(b,c)} \u2212 p_b + \u03b3]_+, p_min^{(b,c)} := min_{x \u2208 C \\ {b,c}} p_x, and D_{b,c}(\u03b3) = t_b({b,c}) \u2212 t_c({b,c}) + \u03b3.\n\nProof.\nLet z := p_min^{(b,c)}. In round 1, to ensure some x \u2208 C \\ {b,c} is eliminated while both b and c strictly exceed x by \u03b3, we need t'_b(C) \u2265 z + \u03b3 and t'_c(C) \u2265 z + \u03b3. Since t'_b(C) \u2212 p_b \u2264 ||y||_1 and t'_c(C) \u2212 p_c \u2264 ||y||_1 (mass can increase a candidate\u2019s top-of-C share by at most the added mass), we must have ||y||_1 \u2265 B_b^{(1)}(\u03b3) and ||y||_1 \u2265 A_b^{(1)}(\u03b3). In the final, t'_c({b,c}) \u2212 t'_b({b,c}) = (t_c \u2212 t_b) + \u2211_r y(r)(1[c\u227bb] \u2212 1[b\u227bc]) \u2265 \u03b3. The contribution per unit mass is at most 1 in absolute value, hence ||y||_1 \u2265 [D_{b,c}(\u03b3) \u2212 (t_c \u2212 t_b)]_+ = D_{b,c}(\u03b3). Combining the first-round lower bounds with the final-round requirement yields the stated bound: the total must be \u2265 B_b^{(1)}(\u03b3) and \u2265 A_b^{(1)}(\u03b3), and the pairwise constraint forces \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2265 D_{b,c}(\u03b3), which in L1 translates into an additional max{0, D_{b,c}(\u03b3) \u2212 (A_b^{(1)}(\u03b3) \u2212 B_b^{(1)}(\u03b3))} \u2265 max{0, B_b^{(1)}(\u03b3) + D_{b,c}(\u03b3) \u2212 A_b^{(1)}(\u03b3)}. Arranging terms gives the expression. Tightness for K = 3 follows from the exact two-type formula. \u220e\n\nLower bound via Fano (sketch)\nConstruct a family {P_b: b \u2208 C \\ {c}} with the same chain tallies for all b (so A_b = B_b = 0), but differing only in the pairwise bc margin: D_{b,c} = \u2212\u03b5 for the distinguished b (so \u03a6_b \u2264 \u03b5) and D_{b\u2032,c} = +3\u03b5 for all b\u2032 \u2260 b (so \u03a6_{b\u2032} \u2265 3\u03b5). Realize this by mixing a common base distribution P_0 with, for each b, an \u03b7 = \u0398(\u03b5) mass concentrated on ballots that top the baseline e_1 and rank c\u227bb (for P_b) or b\u227bc (for P_{b\u2032}), keeping all other pairwise and top-of-S tallies unchanged. Then KL(P_b || P_{b\u2032}) = O(\u03b5^2) for b \u2260 b\u2032. Let I be uniform on C \\ {c}, draw m ballots from P_I. Any algorithm that, with probability \u2265 2/3, outputs a candidate that is an \u03b5-winner must identify I (since only the pivot b = I yields c as an \u03b5-winner), implying by Fano\n  m \u2265 c \u00b7 (log(K \u2212 1)) / \u03b5^2.\nA full write-up will specify the base P_0 and verify tallies and KL bounds formally.\n\nSeparation template for K \u2265 4 (three-type beats chain two-type)\n- Aim: produce P such that for a fixed pivot b, \u03a6_b(P; 0) = B + max{A, B + D} is strictly larger than the true minimal augmentation. Mechanism: arrange large slack in round 1 so that adding y-first ballots (where y = e_1) does not change the first elimination, but these y-first ballots\u2014with c \u227b b\u2014contribute only to S_j with y \u2209 S_j and increase the bc final margin without inflating earlier S_j where no uplift is needed. Combine with modest c-first and b-first mass to satisfy any remaining S_2 deficit and the final margin. By tuning P to have A driven mainly by S_2 while D is also positive, one can strictly reduce \u03b1 compared to using only c-first/b-first. A small linear program over a handful of ranking types suffices to instantiate numeric values; we will produce such a profile in the next round.\n\nObstacles\n- Fixed-order LP sensitivity: bounding sup_{\u03bb} ||\u03bb||_1 remains open when accounting correctly for the negative blocks in the dual constraints. A promising direction is margin-dependent bounds: if each round-j loser \u03c0(j) has a gap of at least \u03b7_j to all survivors in S_j, can we prove sup||\u03bb||_1 \u2264 poly(K) \u00b7 f({\u03b7_j})? A carefully chosen set of test rankings, grouped by the identity of top_{S_j}, may permit a telescoping argument that keeps the negative terms under control.\n- Chain identification without sample splitting: directly union-bounding over all possible chains costs O(K!) in the worst case; thus a margin-based, data-dependent stability check is preferable.\n\nNext steps\n- Produce a concrete K = 4 separation with explicit ranking-support probabilities verifying a strict gap between min_b \u03a6_b and the true minimal augmentation (using three types as per the template).\n- Formalize the Fano construction: specify P_0 and {P_b}, compute pairwise KL bounds, and finalize the \u03a9((log K)/\u03b5^2) lower bound.\n- Add the cleanup lemma, chain-stability lemma, and the sample-splitting certification theorem to proofs.md; summarize in output.md with the safe Lipschitz constant 6 and explicit sample-complexity scalings.\n- Explore margin-dependent dual-norm bounds for the fixed-order LP, starting with K = 4 and synthetic profiles where per-round gaps are controlled.\n"
