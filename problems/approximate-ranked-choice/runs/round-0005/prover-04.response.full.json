For a fixed pivot b\u2260c, put p_min^{(b,c)}:=min_{x\u2208C\\\\{b,c}} p_x and\\n- A^{(1)}_b(\u03b3):=[p_min^{(b,c)} \u2212 p_c + \u03b3]_+,\\n- B^{(1)}_b(\u03b3):=[p_min^{(b,c)} \u2212 p_b + \u03b3]_+,\\n- D_{b,c}(\u03b3):=t_b({b,c}) \u2212 t_c({b,c}) + \u03b3.\\n\\nTheorem (Round\u20111 + Final lower bound). Consider any nonnegative added measure y on rankings with total mass ||y||_1, such that under the augmented profile IRV yields a {b,c} final and c beats b by \u2265\u03b3 in that final.

Partition y into y_c (top_C=c), y_b (top_C=b), and y_rest (top_C\u2209{b,c}), with masses \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03d1 respectively. To avoid eliminating c or b in round 1 we must have p_c+\u03b1 \u2265 p_min^{(b,c)}+\u03b3 and p_b+\u03b2 \u2265 p_min^{(b,c)}+\u03b3, hence \u03b1 \u2265 A^{(1)}_b(\u03b3), \u03b2 \u2265 B^{(1)}_b(\u03b3). In the final {b,c}, the net margin update is (t_c\u2212t_b)+ (\u03b1\u2212\u03b2) + (\u03b8_c\u2212\u03b8_b), where \u03b8_c (resp., \u03b8_b) is the contribution to the pairwise from y_rest; trivially \u03b8_c\u2212\u03b8_b \u2208 [\u2212\u03d1, \u03d1]. A strict c win by \u2265\u03b3 therefore requires \u03b1\u2212\u03b2+\u03d1 \u2265 D_{b,c}(\u03b3). Minimizing \u03b1+\u03b2+\u03d1 subject to \u03b1 \u2265 A, \u03b2 \u2265 B, \u03b1\u2212\u03b2+\u03d1 \u2265 D is a linear program with optimum B + max{A, B + D}, achieved at \u03b2=B and either \u03b1=A, \u03d1=(D\u2212(A\u2212B))_+ or \u03b1=B+D, \u03d1=0. Substituting A=A^{(1)}_b(\u03b3), B=B^{(1)}_b(\u03b3), D=D_{b,c}(\u03b3) gives the bound. For K=3 there are no additional round constraints beyond round 1 and the final, and the standard two\u2011type construction attains equality.\\n\\nCorollary (Lower-bounding the chain certificate). For the chain-based two\u2011type certificate with the baseline chain e_1,\u2026,e_{K\u22122} (see \u00a72 below), A_b(\u03b3)\u2265A^{(1)}_b(\u03b3) and B_b(\u03b3)\u2265B^{(1)}_b(\u03b3) since S_1=C is included. Hence \u03b5_b^*(\u03b3) \u2265 L_b(\u03b3).\\n\\n## 2) Chain-based two\u2011type certificate and cleanup under preserved order\\n\\nFix c and a pivot b\u2260c.

Put\\n- A_b(\u03b3):=max_{j} [t_{e_j}(S_j) \u2212 t_c(S_j) + \u03b3]_+,\\n- B_b(\u03b3):=max_{j} [t_{e_j}(S_j) \u2212 t_b(S_j) + \u03b3]_+,\\n- D_{b,c}(\u03b3):=t_b({b,c}) \u2212 t_c({b,c}) + \u03b3.\\n\\nTheorem (Chain-based two\u2011type certificate). For any \u03b1,\u03b2\u22650 with \u03b1 \u2265 A_b(\u03b3), \u03b2 \u2265 B_b(\u03b3), and \u03b1\u2212\u03b2 \u2265 D_{b,c}(\u03b3), adding \u03b1 mass of c\u2011first ballots and \u03b2 mass of b\u2011first ballots eliminates e_1,\u2026,e_{K\u22122} in order and elects c over b in the final by \u2265\u03b3. The minimal two\u2011type mass is\\n  \u03b5_b^*(\u03b3) = B_b(\u03b3) + max{ A_b(\u03b3), B_b(\u03b3) + D_{b,c}(\u03b3) }.\\n\\nProof. As in the notes: for each S_j, only t_c(S_j) and t_b(S_j) increase, by \u03b1 and \u03b2 respectively; e_j remains the unique minimal among S_j\\\\{b,c} since other \u201cothers\u201d are unchanged and weakly \u2265 t_{e_j}(S_j). The stated constraints ensure e_j is strictly below both b and c in S_j and hence eliminated. In the final {b,c}, each c\u2011first ballot contributes +1 to c\u2019s tally and each b\u2011first contributes +1 to b\u2019s, hence \u03b1\u2212\u03b2 \u2265 D_{b,c}(\u03b3) gives the strict final win. Minimization over \u03b1,\u03b2 is the same 2\u2011variable polyhedron as in \u00a71 and yields \u03b5_b^*(\u03b3).\\n\\nCleanup lemma (preserved order among others). Suppose we restrict to augmentations y that preserve the baseline relative order among \u201cothers\u201d in every S_j (i.e., for all pairs d,d\u2032\u2208S_j\\\\{b,c}, sign(t'_d(S_j) \u2212 t'_{d\u2032}(S_j)) = sign(t_d(S_j) \u2212 t_{d\u2032}(S_j))). Then among such y the minimum total mass to realize the chain e_1,\u2026,e_{K\u22122} with a strict c\u2011over\u2011b final is achieved by a two\u2011type (c\u2011first,b\u2011first) augmentation of cost \u03b5_b^*(\u03b3).\\n\\nProof. Under the preserved-order restriction, the e_j remain the minimal \u201cother\u201d at each S_j. Any ranking r that tops some e_j on S_j decreases the corresponding c\u2011vs\u2011e_j and b\u2011vs\u2011e_j constraints by 1 and thus cannot be part of an optimal y (it is strictly dominated by replacing its mass with either c\u2011first or b\u2011first, which increases all round\u2011j constraints they touch, and can be balanced to respect the final margin). Therefore an optimal y uses only rankings whose top on all S_j lies in {b,c}, which yields exactly the two types c\u2011first and b\u2011first; the cost reduces to the 2\u2011variable minimum in the theorem.\\n\\nRemark. This formalizes and isolates the regime in which two types are indeed optimal (even for K\u22654). Any potential benefit of a third type must come from changing the order among \u201cothers\u201d in some S_j.\\n\\n## 3) Sampling with chain stability: all pivots simultaneously\\n\\nDefine chain gaps for pivot b: for j=1,\u2026,K\u22122,\\n  \u03bc_{b,j} := min_{x\u2208S_j\\\\{b,c,e_j}} ( t_x(S_j) \u2212 t_{e_j}(S_j) ), and \u03bc_b := min_j \u03bc_{b,j}.\\nLet \u03bc:=min_{b\u2260c} \u03bc_b. Assume \u03bc>0.\\n\\nTheorem (Two\u2011stage sampling under chain stability). Fix \u03b5,\u03b4\u2208(0,1) and \u03b3>0. There exist absolute constants c_1,c_2 such that the following holds. Draw m=m_1+m_2 ballots with independent sample splitting:\\n- Stage 1 (identify all chains). With m_1 \u2265 c_1 \u03bc^{-2} log( (K\u22121)(K\u22122)/ (\u03b4/2) ), the empirical chains \\\\{\\\\hat e_j^{(b)}\\\\}_{j} equal the true chains \\\\{e_j^{(b)}\\\\}_{j} for all pivots b simultaneously with probability \u22651\u2212\u03b4/2.\\n- Stage 2 (estimate tallies on identified chains). Conditional on Stage 1 success, there are at most M:= (K\u22121)(K\u22122) distinct chain sets S_j^{(b)} across all pivots b, plus at most (K\u22121) final pairs {b,c}. If m_2 \u2265 c_2 \u03c4^{-2} log( (M + (K\u22121))/ (\u03b4/2) ), then with probability \u22651\u2212\u03b4/2, all needed tallies t_c(S_j^{(b)}), t_b(S_j^{(b)}), t_{e_j^{(b)}}(S_j^{(b)}), and t_c({b,c}), t_b({b,c}) are within \u00b1\u03c4 simultaneously.\\n- Consequently, with probability \u22651\u2212\u03b4, for every b we have |\\\\widehat{\u03b5}_b^*(\u03b3) \u2212 \u03b5_b^*(\u03b3)| \u2264 L \u03c4 with L\u22646 (sup\u2011norm Lipschitz bound). Declaring c an \u03b5\u2011winner if min_{b\u2260c} \\\\widehat{\u03b5}_b^*(\u03b3) \u2264 \u03b5 \u2212 L\u03c4 is sound.\\n\\nProof. Stage 1: For each pivot b and step j, a misidentification requires reversing the order between t_{e_j} and the second\u2011minimal among S_j\\\\{b,c}, a deviation \u2265 \u03bc_b/2 under sup\u2011norm errors \u2264 \u03bc_b/4; Hoeffding\u2019s inequality and a union bound over \u2264(K\u22121)(K\u22122) steps yield the m_1 bound. Stage 2: The total number of distinct sets to be estimated is at most M+(K\u22121)=O(K^2). Apply Hoeffding and a union bound. Lipschitz: As in the notes, \u03b5_b^*(\u03b3)=B_b+max{A_b, B_b+D_{b,c}}, each of A_b,B_b is a max of positive parts of affine functionals in the relevant tallies (l_1 subgradient norms \u2264 2), and D has l_1 subgradient norm 2; the worst branch is 2B_b + D (l_1 norm \u2264 6). The min over b preserves Lipschitzness with the same constant.\\n\\nRemarks. When \u03bc is small, Stage 1 may fail frequently; a distribution\u2011free fallback is the c\u2011first certificate M_c with uniform convergence (exponential in K). For K=3, this theorem collapses to the known m=\u0398((log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2) using five tallies.\\n\\n## 4) Counting refinement for the c\u2011first certificate\\n\\nLemma (indicator count for fixed c). The number of indicator functions r\u21a61[top_S(r)=a] with c\u2208S, a\u2208S\\\\{c}, |S|\u22652 equals N_c=(K\u22121)2^{K\u22122}.\\n\\nProof. For each s=|S|\u22652, choose the s\u22121 companions of c in C(K\u22121,s\u22121) ways and choose a among the s\u22121 non\u2011c elements; summing gives \u2211_{s=2}^K C(K\u22121,s\u22121)(s\u22121)=(K\u22121)2^{K\u22122}.\\n\\nTherefore, for certifying a fixed c via M_c, a Hoeffding + union bound over N_c indicators yields m=O((log N_c + log(1/\u03b4))/\u03c4^2)=O(((K\u22121)+log(1/\u03b4))/\u03c4^2), with the 2^{K\u22122} entering only inside the logarithm.\\n\\n# Fano-style \u03a9((log K)/\u03b5^2) lower bound sketch\\n\\nGoal. Show that any algorithm that, with probability \u22653/4, outputs an \u03b5\u2011winner must use m=\u03a9((log K)/\u03b5^2) samples in the worst case (beyond the \u03a9((1/\u03b5^2) log(1/\u03b4)) dependence), by embedding a choice among K\u22121 plausible pivots b.\\n\\nConstruction sketch. Fix c. For each b\u2208C\\\\{c}, choose a \u201cshield\u201d u_b\u2208C\\\\{b,c} with high baseline tallies in all S containing u_b, so that u_b is never eliminated before the final {b,c} in the baseline. Introduce an independent small block of voters of total weight \u03c1 (to be tuned) that, for pivot b, split between two rankings R_b^+ and R_b^\u2212:\\n- R_b^+: u_b \u227b c \u227b b \u227b (others in any order),\\n- R_b^\u2212: u_b \u227b b \u227b c \u227b (others in any order).\\nThese blocks have the property that for any S that contains u_b their top among S is u_b (hence they do not affect any t_x(S) used in the chain constraints), while for S={b,c} they contribute +1 (for R_b^+) or \u22121 (for R_b^\u2212) to t_c({b,c})\u2212t_b({b,c}). Consider the family of K\u22121 hypotheses H_b indexed by b where we bias the block for b towards R_b^+ by an amount \u03b8 (and keep all other blocks unbiased with equal weights on R_{b\u2032}^\u00b1), so that\\n  D_{b,c}(0) = \u2212\u03b8  and  D_{b\u2032,c}(0) = 0 for all b\u2032\u2260b.\\nCalibrate \u03b8\u2248c\u00b7\u03b5 so that c is an \u03b5\u2011winner under H_b (via pivot b) but not under H_{b\u2032} for b\u2032\u2260b (the Round\u20111 + Final lower bound L_b provides the threshold), while the KL divergence between H_b and H_{b\u2032} per sample is O(\u03b8^2)=O(\u03b5^2) (since they differ only by a \u03b8\u2011level perturbation on two rankings within a block of weight \u03c1=\u0398(1)). Applying Fano\u2019s inequality over the (K\u22121)\u2011ary family {H_b} shows m=\u03a9((log K)/\u03b5^2) samples are required to identify the correct b (hence to output an \u03b5\u2011winner) with probability \u22653/4.\\n\\nRemarks. This construction can be made fully rigorous by specifying baseline tallies that keep u_b dominant in all relevant S (hence shielding the chain tallies from the perturbations) and by choosing \u03b8 small enough to preserve all separation margins. The key is that the perturbations are disjoint across b and influence only D_{b,c}, keeping all chain quantities identical across hypotheses.\\n\\n# Examples and checks\\n\\n- K=3 tightness. With p_a=0.38, p_b=0.35, p_c=0.27 and t_c({b,c})\u2212t_b({b,c})=0.10, choosing \u03b3\u21920 yields A^{(1)}=0.11, B^{(1)}=0.03, D=\u22120.10, and L_b(0)=0.03+max{0.11,\u22120.07}=0.14, matching the exact minimal augmentation \u03b5_a^*.\\n- Counting of sets for Stage 2. Across all pivots b there are at most (K\u22121)(K\u22122) chain sets S_j^{(b)} (each chain has length K\u22122). Adding the (K\u22121) final pairs gives O(K^2) distinct tallies, enabling a polynomial union bound.\\n\\n# Obstacles\\n\\n- K\u22654 three\u2011type separation example. We have not yet produced an explicit profile P where a 3\u2011type augmentation (c\u2011first, b\u2011first, and one additional opponent\u2011first) strictly beats the chain two\u2011type bound \u03b5_b^* while respecting the Round\u20111 + Final lower bound. The challenge is to exploit path changes: altering the order among \u201cothers\u201d requires adding mass that tops some \u201cother\u201d in some S_j, which risks increasing the maxima A_b,B_b. A careful construction balancing these effects remains to be found.\\n- Fixed\u2011order LP sensitivity. Bounding sup_{\u03bb\u2208\u039b} ||\u03bb||_1 for the exact fixed\u2011order LP dual remains open; naive arguments fail due to the negative term at j=pos_\u03c0(x). A local (margin\u2011dependent) sensitivity bound or a structured dual design may be necessary.\\n\\n# Next steps\\n\\n- Add the Round\u20111 + Final lower bound (with proof) and its K=3 tightness to proofs.md and summarize in output.md.\\n- Record the cleanup lemma (preserved order) to clarify the exact regime where two types are optimal; mark the general \u201cthree\u2011type advantage\u201d as an open target and attempt a concrete K=4 construction.\\n- Formalize the Fano lower bound: fully specify the shielded block family {H_b}, verify separation margins and compute the KL to conclude m=\u03a9((log K)/\u03b5^2).\\n- Extend the chain\u2011stability sampling theorem with explicit constants and an implementable data\u2011driven gap check (compute empirical gaps and abort to c\u2011first certificate if they fall below a threshold).\\n- Investigate structural conditions (coherence of \u201cothers\u201d ordering across S_j) under which \u03b5_b^*(\u03b3)=L_b(\u03b3) for some b, yielding near\u2011exact certificates beyond K=3.\\n\"}",
