  "summary_md": "This round validated and formalized sampling certificates and augmentation characterizations for IRV \u03b5-winners. Key validated results: a distribution-free c-first sufficient certificate M_c with plug-in sampling m = \u0398((K+log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2); an exact K=3 two-type minimal-augmentation formula computable from five tallies with m = \u0398((log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2); a general-K chain-based two-type sufficient certificate \u03b5_b^* = B_b + max{A_b, B_b + D_{b,c}} depending on O(K) subset tallies and certifiable under a verifiable chain-stability margin with m = \u0398((log K + log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2); the LP fixed-order primal/dual gives an exact characterization but the dual-sensitivity constant R_K (sup ||\u03bb||_1) is open; and a K=4 separation example shows the chain two-type bound is not tight (extra ballot types can strictly reduce needed mass). Information-theoretic lower bound \u03a9((1/\u03b5^2) log(1/\u03b4)) holds. Citations: proofs.md, output.md, notes.",
  "highlights": [
    "Distribution-free c-first certificate M_c is a sound sufficient condition; plug-in testing needs m=\u0398((K+log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2).",
    "Exact K=3 closed-form two-type minimal-augmentation (\u03b5^*(c)) computable from five tallies; sampling m=\u0398((log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2).",
    "General-K chain-based two-type certificate (pivot b): \u03b5_b^*=B_b+max{A_b,B_b+D_{b,c}}; O(K) tallies and verifiable chain-stability give m=\u0398((log K+log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2).",
    "LP fixed-order primal/dual exactly characterizes minimal added mass, but bounding dual 1-norm R_K= sup_{\u03bb\u2208\u039b}||\u03bb||_1 by poly(K) remains open (blocks poly(K) sample guarantee).",
    "Constructed K=4 counterexample where steering early eliminations with a third added-top type yields strictly smaller augmentation (~0.1202) than best chain two-type bound (0.15), so chain two-type is not tight for K\u22654."

  "next_questions": [
    "Prove or refute a polynomial-in-K bound on the LP dual norm R_K (or develop an alternative sensitivity/stability argument for the fixed-order LP).",
    "Formalize a Fano/packing \u03a9((log K)/\u03b5^2) lower bound for identifying a favorable pivot/opponent among K\u22121 options.",
    "Develop and analyze few-type targeted-chain LPs (small steering set T) and produce families of K\u22654 instances where \u22653 added-top types strictly outperform the chain two-type certificate."
