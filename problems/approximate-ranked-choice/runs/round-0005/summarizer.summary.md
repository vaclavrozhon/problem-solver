This round validated and formalized sampling certificates and augmentation characterizations for IRV ε-winners. Key validated results: a distribution-free c-first sufficient certificate M_c with plug-in sampling m = Θ((K+log(1/δ))/ε^2); an exact K=3 two-type minimal-augmentation formula computable from five tallies with m = Θ((log(1/δ))/ε^2); a general-K chain-based two-type sufficient certificate ε_b^* = B_b + max{A_b, B_b + D_{b,c}} depending on O(K) subset tallies and certifiable under a verifiable chain-stability margin with m = Θ((log K + log(1/δ))/ε^2); the LP fixed-order primal/dual gives an exact characterization but the dual-sensitivity constant R_K (sup ||λ||_1) is open; and a K=4 separation example shows the chain two-type bound is not tight (extra ballot types can strictly reduce needed mass). Information-theoretic lower bound Ω((1/ε^2) log(1/δ)) holds. Citations: proofs.md, output.md, notes.
