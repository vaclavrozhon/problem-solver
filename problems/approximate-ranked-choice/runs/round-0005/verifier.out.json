We now have: (i) a rigorous, general-K chain-based two-type certificate (fix pivot b, follow the baseline minimal-of-others chain, and minimize \u03b1+\u03b2 over \u03b1 \u2265 A_b, \u03b2 \u2265 B_b, \u03b1\u2212\u03b2 \u2265 D_{b,c}); (ii) a clean sampling scheme via sample-splitting under a verifiable chain-stability margin, with a safe 6\u03c4 plug-in margin; (iii) a necessary Round-1 + Final lower bound L_b(\u03b3) that is tight for K=3 and lower-bounds any chain certificate; and (iv) an explicit K=4 separation example showing the chain-based two-type certificate is not tight in general.\n\nAudit notes and fixes:\n- Prover 1\u2019s K=4 example checks out. The baseline tallies and subset tallies are internally consistent, the best pivot-chain cost is 0.15, and adding \u03b2_a \u2248 0.0701 a-first (completed with c \u227b b) and \u03b1 \u2248 0.0501 c-first yields: Round 1 eliminates d (0.25 < 0.2501), Round 2 on {a,b,c} eliminates a (0.3001 < 0.3551, 0.465), and the final c vs b has margin (0.475 + \u03b1 + \u03b2_a) \u2212 0.525 > 0. Total mass \u2248 0.1202 < 0.15. Please explicitly state the a-first completion (e.g., a \u227b c \u227b b \u227b d) to avoid ambiguity in the pairwise calculation.\n- Provers 2\u20133: The chain certificate proof, cleanup lemma, and sampling via sample-splitting are sound. Ensure the sampling statements only use tallies on empirically identified chains (Stage II) and carry the 6\u03c4 Lipschitz margin. Avoid any reliance on the previously invalid dual-norm bounds (those omitted negative terms at j = pos_\u03c0(x)).\n- Prover 4: The Round-1 + Final lower bound L_b(\u03b3) is correct and tight for K=3, and it cleanly benchmarks \u03b5_b^*(\u03b3) \u2265 L_b(\u03b3). The multi-pivot, simultaneous stability/estimation counting (O(K^2) sets) is also precise.\n\nConcrete next steps:\n- Formalize the K=4 separation example (with explicit completions) in proofs.md. Generalize to a small-support LP search for \u22653-type advantages.\n- Prove the \u03a9((log K)/\u03b5^2) lower bound via a fully specified Fano packing (shielding construction) with verified KL bounds.\n- Pursue margin-dependent sensitivity for the fixed-order LP (or an order-approximation scheme) to obtain polynomial sample guarantees without stability assumptions.\n- Package a hybrid certifier (c-first, K=3 exact, chain-based under stability), with unified sampling/log factors.\n",

We proved a Round-1 + Final necessary lower bound L_b(\u03b3), tight for K=3 and lower-bounding the chain cost.

If a is removed: S2={b,c,d} \u2192 (0.41,0.22,0.37). If d is removed: S2\u2032={a,b,c} \u2192 (0.23,0.465,0.305). Pairwise c vs b: t_c({b,c})=0.475, t_b({b,c})=0.525.\n\nBest chain (pivot b): e1=a (min of {a,d}), S2={b,c,d}, e2=d. Chain cost: A_b(0)=max{[0.18\u22120.22]_+, [0.37\u22120.22]_+}=0.15, B_b(0)=0, D_{b,c}=0.05, hence \u03b5_b^{(2)}=0.15.\n\nAugmentation achieving lower cost: add \u03b2_a=0.0701 of a-first ballots completed as a \u227b c \u227b b \u227b d, and \u03b1=0.0501 of c-first ballots.\n- Round 1: (a,b,c,d) \u2192 (0.2501, 0.35, 0.2701, 0.25), so d is uniquely minimal and is eliminated.\n- Round 2 on {a,b,c}: (a,b,c) \u2192 (0.3001, 0.465, 0.3551), so a is eliminated.\n- Final {b,c}: new margin = (0.475 + \u03b1 + \u03b2_a) \u2212 0.525 = \u03b1 + \u03b2_a \u2212 0.05 > 0.\nTotal mass \u2248 0.1202 < 0.15. Thus, chain two-type is not tight for K \u2265 4. Intuition: a-first ballots steer the first elimination (d instead of a), avoiding a large deficit at S2={b,c,d}; c-first then overcomes the small bc deficit.\n\nFew-type targeted-chain LP (idea): For a chosen final opponent y and a small steering set T \u2286 C\\{c,y}, minimize \u2211_{t\u2208T\u222a{c,y}} x_t subject to per-round linear inequalities along a targeted elimination path (with \u03b3-slack), plus the final c-over-y constraint. This generalizes the chain two-type plan (T=\u2205) and may capture the above separation cases. Sampling remains polynomial since only O(K) chain tallies and O(|T|) pairwise tallies are needed.\n\nLower bounds: The Round\u20111 + Final necessary lower bound L_b(\u03b3) remains a universal benchmark (tight for K=3). A Fano-style family indexed by the favorable pivot b, with only D_{b,c} perturbed (chain tallies held fixed), should yield \u03a9((log K)/\u03b5^2); formalization next.\n"

The baseline chain (excluding {b,c}) is e1=a, S2={b,c,d}, e2=d. Then\nA_b(0)=max{[t_a(C)\u2212t_c(C)]_+, [t_d(S2)\u2212t_c(S2)]_+}=max{[0.18\u22120.22]_+, [0.37\u22120.22]_+}=0.15,\nB_b(0)=max{[0.18\u22120.35]_+, [0.37\u22120.41]_+}=0,\nhence \u03b5_b^*(0)=B_b(0)+max{A_b(0), B_b(0)+D_{b,c}}=0.15. Other pivots are worse (pivot d: \u03b5_d^*(0)=0.04+max{0.19,\u22120.10}=0.23; pivot a: \u03b5_a^*(0)=0.235+max{0.16,0.395}=0.63). Therefore min_b \u03b5_b^*(0)=0.15.\n\nFeasible augmentation beating 0.15. Add \u03b2_a=0.0701 mass of a-first ballots completed as a \u227b c \u227b b \u227b d, and \u03b1=0.0501 mass of c-first ballots.

The total mass is \u03b1 + \u03b2_a \u2248 0.1202 < 0.15.\n\nConclusion. The chain-based two-type certificate (optimized over pivots) is not tight for K \u2265 4.\n\nRemark. The improvement hinges on changing the early elimination order (removing d first) using a-first ballots, thereby avoiding the large deficit at S2={b,c,d}. This shows that allowing additional added-top types beyond {c, pivot} can strictly reduce the required augmentation.\n"
