The baseline tallies and subset tallies are internally consistent, the best pivot-chain cost is 0.15, and adding \u03b2_a \u2248 0.0701 a-first (completed with c \u227b b) and \u03b1 \u2248 0.0501 c-first yields: Round 1 eliminates d (0.25 < 0.2501), Round 2 on {a,b,c} eliminates a (0.3001 < 0.3551, 0.465), and the final c vs b has margin (0.475 + \u03b1 + \u03b2_a) \u2212 0.525 > 0.

Ensure the sampling statements only use tallies on empirically identified chains (Stage II) and carry the 6\u03c4 Lipschitz margin. Avoid any reliance on the previously invalid dual-norm bounds (those omitted negative terms at j = pos_\u03c0(x)).\\n- Prover 4: The Round-1 + Final lower bound L_b(\u03b3) is correct and tight for K=3, and it cleanly benchmarks \u03b5_b^*(\u03b3) \u2265 L_b(\u03b3). The multi-pivot, simultaneous stability/estimation counting (O(K^2) sets) is also precise.\\n\\nConcrete next steps:\\n- Formalize the K=4 separation example (with explicit completions) in proofs.md. Generalize to a small-support LP search for \u22653-type advantages.\\n- Prove the \u03a9((log K)/\u03b5^2) lower bound via a fully specified Fano packing (shielding construction) with verified KL bounds.\\n- Pursue margin-dependent sensitivity for the fixed-order LP (or an order-approximation scheme) to obtain polynomial sample guarantees without stability assumptions.\\n- Package a hybrid certifier (c-first, K=3 exact, chain-based under stability), with unified sampling/log factors.\\n\",\n  \"summary_md\": \"We validated a general-K chain-based two-type certificate with a 2D exact cost and a sample-splitting certification theorem (margin 6\u03c4, O((log K + log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2) samples under chain stability).
