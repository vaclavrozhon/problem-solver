We validated a general-K chain-based two-type certificate with a 2D exact cost and a sample-splitting certification theorem (margin 6τ, O((log K + log(1/δ))/ε^2) samples under chain stability). We proved a Round-1 + Final necessary lower bound L_b(γ), tight for K=3 and lower-bounding the chain cost. Crucially, we added a rigorous K=4 example where the best chain two-type bound (0.15) is beaten by a feasible augmentation of mass ≈0.1202 using c-first and a-first ballots—showing chain two-type is not tight for K≥4. The fixed-order LP dual sensitivity bound remains open; formal Fano-based Ω((log K)/ε^2) lower bounds are in progress.
