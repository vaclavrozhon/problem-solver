  "feedback_md": "Progress this round is substantial. We now have: (i) a rigorous, general-K chain-based two-type certificate (fix pivot b, follow the baseline minimal-of-others chain, and minimize α+β over α ≥ A_b, β ≥ B_b, α−β ≥ D_{b,c}); (ii) a clean sampling scheme via sample-splitting under a verifiable chain-stability margin, with a safe 6τ plug-in margin; (iii) a necessary Round-1 + Final lower bound L_b(γ) that is tight for K=3 and lower-bounds any chain certificate; and (iv) an explicit K=4 separation example showing the chain-based two-type certificate is not tight in general.\n\nAudit notes and fixes:\n- Prover 1’s K=4 example checks out. The baseline tallies and subset tallies are internally consistent, the best pivot-chain cost is 0.15, and adding β_a ≈ 0.0701 a-first (completed with c ≻ b) and α ≈ 0.0501 c-first yields: Round 1 eliminates d (0.25 < 0.2501), Round 2 on {a,b,c} eliminates a (0.3001 < 0.3551, 0.465), and the final c vs b has margin (0.475 + α + β_a) − 0.525 > 0. Total mass ≈ 0.1202 < 0.15. Please explicitly state the a-first completion (e.g., a ≻ c ≻ b ≻ d) to avoid ambiguity in the pairwise calculation.\n- Provers 2–3: The chain certificate proof, cleanup lemma, and sampling via sample-splitting are sound. Ensure the sampling statements only use tallies on empirically identified chains (Stage II) and carry the 6τ Lipschitz margin. Avoid any reliance on the previously invalid dual-norm bounds (those omitted negative terms at j = pos_π(x)).\n- Prover 4: The Round-1 + Final lower bound L_b(γ) is correct and tight for K=3, and it cleanly benchmarks ε_b^*(γ) ≥ L_b(γ). The multi-pivot, simultaneous stability/estimation counting (O(K^2) sets) is also precise.\n\nConcrete next steps:\n- Formalize the K=4 separation example (with explicit completions) in proofs.md. Generalize to a small-support LP search for ≥3-type advantages.\n- Prove the Ω((log K)/ε^2) lower bound via a fully specified Fano packing (shielding construction) with verified KL bounds.\n- Pursue margin-dependent sensitivity for the fixed-order LP (or an order-approximation scheme) to obtain polynomial sample guarantees without stability assumptions.\n- Package a hybrid certifier (c-first, K=3 exact, chain-based under stability), with unified sampling/log factors.\n",
  "summary_md": "We validated a general-K chain-based two-type certificate with a 2D exact cost and a sample-splitting certification theorem (margin 6τ, O((log K + log(1/δ))/ε^2) samples under chain stability). We proved a Round-1 + Final necessary lower bound L_b(γ), tight for K=3 and lower-bounding the chain cost. Crucially, we added a rigorous K=4 example where the best chain two-type bound (0.15) is beaten by a feasible augmentation of mass ≈0.1202 using c-first and a-first ballots—showing chain two-type is not tight for K≥4. The fixed-order LP dual sensitivity bound remains open; formal Fano-based Ω((log K)/ε^2) lower bounds are in progress.",

If a is removed: S2={b,c,d} → (0.41,0.22,0.37). If d is removed: S2′={a,b,c} → (0.23,0.465,0.305). Pairwise c vs b: t_c({b,c})=0.475, t_b({b,c})=0.525.\n\nBest chain (pivot b): e1=a (min of {a,d}), S2={b,c,d}, e2=d. Chain cost: A_b(0)=max{[0.18−0.22]_+, [0.37−0.22]_+}=0.15, B_b(0)=0, D_{b,c}=0.05, hence ε_b^{(2)}=0.15.\n\nAugmentation achieving lower cost: add β_a=0.0701 of a-first ballots completed as a ≻ c ≻ b ≻ d, and α=0.0501 of c-first ballots.\n- Round 1: (a,b,c,d) → (0.2501, 0.35, 0.2701, 0.25), so d is uniquely minimal and is eliminated.\n- Round 2 on {a,b,c}: (a,b,c) → (0.3001, 0.465, 0.3551), so a is eliminated.\n- Final {b,c}: new margin = (0.475 + α + β_a) − 0.525 = α + β_a − 0.05 > 0.\nTotal mass ≈ 0.1202 < 0.15. Thus, chain two-type is not tight for K ≥ 4. Intuition: a-first ballots steer the first elimination (d instead of a), avoiding a large deficit at S2={b,c,d}; c-first then overcomes the small bc deficit.\n\nFew-type targeted-chain LP (idea): For a chosen final opponent y and a small steering set T ⊆ C\\{c,y}, minimize ∑_{t∈T∪{c,y}} x_t subject to per-round linear inequalities along a targeted elimination path (with γ-slack), plus the final c-over-y constraint. This generalizes the chain two-type plan (T=∅) and may capture the above separation cases. Sampling remains polynomial since only O(K) chain tallies and O(|T|) pairwise tallies are needed.\n\nLower bounds: The Round‑1 + Final necessary lower bound L_b(γ) remains a universal benchmark (tight for K=3). A Fano-style family indexed by the favorable pivot b, with only D_{b,c} perturbed (chain tallies held fixed), should yield Ω((log K)/ε^2); formalization next.\n"

The baseline chain (excluding {b,c}) is e1=a, S2={b,c,d}, e2=d.

Other pivots are worse (pivot d: ε_d^*(0)=0.04+max{0.19,−0.10}=0.23; pivot a: ε_a^*(0)=0.235+max{0.16,0.395}=0.63). Therefore min_b ε_b^*(0)=0.15.\n\nFeasible augmentation beating 0.15. Add β_a=0.0701 mass of a-first ballots completed as a ≻ c ≻ b ≻ d, and α=0.0501 mass of c-first ballots. Then:\n- Round 1 (C): (t'_a,t'_b,t'_c,t'_d)=(0.2501,0.35,0.2701,0.25), so d is uniquely minimal and eliminated.\n- Round 2 (S2′={a,b,c}): (t'_a,t'_b,t'_c)=(0.3001,0.465,0.3551), so a is eliminated.\n- Final (S={b,c}): the updated pairwise margin equals\n  t'_c(S) − t'_b(S) = [t_c(S) − t_b(S)] + (α + β_a) = −0.05 + (0.0501 + 0.0701) > 0.\nThus c wins with strict margins. The total mass is α + β_a ≈ 0.1202 < 0.15.\n\nConclusion. The chain-based two-type certificate (optimized over pivots) is not tight for K ≥ 4.\n\nRemark. The improvement hinges on changing the early elimination order (removing d first) using a-first ballots, thereby avoiding the large deficit at S2={b,c,d}. This shows that allowing additional added-top types beyond {c, pivot} can strictly reduce the required augmentation.\n"
