Consider the targeted elimination path: eliminate d from S1 = C, then eliminate a from S2\u2032 = {a,b,c}, then a c-over-b final. Allow only two added types with fixed completions: c-first ballots r^c: c \u227b b \u227b d \u227b a and a-first ballots r^a: a \u227b c \u227b b \u227b d.

For fixed \u03b2, the smallest admissible \u03b1 is \u03b1(\u03b2) = max{LB_\u03b1, D \u2212 \u03b2, \u03b2 \u2212 U_c}, so the objective becomes f(\u03b2) = \u03b2 + \u03b1(\u03b2), piecewise linear/convex on [LB_\u03b2, U_b]; the minimizer lies at an endpoint or at an intersection of two active pieces.

This strictly separates the chain two-type bound from the true minimal augmentation (with these two types) for K = 4.\\n\\n# Lower bound (Fano) for identifying a favorable pivot: \u03a9((log K)/\u03b5^2)\\nConstruct a family {P^y : y \u2208 C\\\\{c}} with the following properties for a fixed \u03b3 > 0 and \u03b5 \u2208 (0, 1/8):\\n- Dominance in all multi-candidate rounds: for every S \u2287 {b,c} and every w \u2208 S\\\\{b,c}, t_w(S) \u2264 min{t_b(S), t_c(S)} \u2212 \u03b3. Thus A_b(\u03b3) = B_b(\u03b3) = 0 for all b.\\n- Pairwise differences: for a designated y, set t_c({c,y}) = 1/2 \u2212 \u03b5 while for all z \u2260 y, t_c({c,z}) = 1/2 \u2212 2\u03b5.\\n- Full-ranking consistency: realize P^y by allocating all mass to rankings where candidates other than {c,y} are below both, and split an \u03b5-fraction of mass between c \u227b y and y \u227b c to achieve the prescribed pairwise margins; the rest of the profile is identical across y.\\nThen c is an \u03b5-winner via the two-type certificate iff there exists y with t_c({c,y}) \u2265 1/2 \u2212 \u03b5. Consider a uniform prior over y \u2208 C\\\\{c}. For y \u2260 y\u2032, the only difference between P^y and P^{y\u2032} lies in the Bernoulli event \u201cc beats the designated opponent\u201d with means p = 1/2 \u2212 \u03b5 vs q = 1/2 \u2212 2\u03b5, so the per-sample KL divergence satisfies KL(P^y || P^{y\u2032}) \u2264 KL(Bern(p)||Bern(q)) \u2264 4\u03b5^2 (since q(1\u2212q) \u2265 1/4 \u2212 o(1)). By Fano\u2019s inequality for multi-hypothesis testing with M = K \u2212 1 hypotheses,\\n  m \u2265 ( (1/2) log M ) / (4\u03b5^2 ) = \u03a9( (log K)/\u03b5^2 )\\n is necessary to identify y (and hence to certify c) with error probability \u2264 1/3; adding a log(1/\u03b4) factor gives \u03a9((log K + log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2) for error \u2264 \u03b4. This matches the log K term in our sampling upper bounds for two-type-like certificates.\\n\\n# Obstacles\\n- Extending the closed-form minimizer beyond K = 4 (or beyond the specific two-step path) requires handling upper and lower bounds across multiple rounds; the piecewise-linear envelope remains tractable but casework grows. A general \u201cfew-type targeted-chain LP\u201d subsumes this and stays low-dimensional.\\n- LP sensitivity: a polynomial bound on sup_{\u03bb\u2208\u039b} ||\u03bb||_1 remains open; a local, margin-dependent bound (when each round\u2019s gap \u2265 \u03bc) seems plausible but needs a careful dual construction that respects the negative term at j = pos_\u03c0(x).\\n\\n# Next steps\\n- Add the K = 4 steered-two-type lemma (with proof) and the tightened example to proofs.md.\\n- Generalize the lemma: for a chosen steering s and path e1 \u2192 e2, write the two-variable closed form as min_{\u03b2 \u2208 [LB_\u03b2, U_b]} \u03b2 + max{ LB_\u03b1, D \u2212 \u03b2, \u03b2 \u2212 U_c }, and verify on additional synthetic profiles.\\n- Implement a few-type targeted-chain LP (variables for {c, pivot, up to 2 steering types}), with sample-splitting and a 6\u03c4 margin; record its piecewise-linear stability under sup-norm ballot-tally perturbations.\\n- Formalize the Fano lower bound with explicit constants and a fully specified ranking family; add to proofs.md as a theorem.\\n- Package a hybrid certifier: (i) K = 3 exact; (ii) chain two-type under stability; (iii) steered-two-type for K = 4 (and small K) paths; (iv) c-first fallback.
