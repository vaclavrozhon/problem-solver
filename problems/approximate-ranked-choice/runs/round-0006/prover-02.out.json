  "content": "Ideas\n- Extend the chain-based method by allowing a single \u201csteering\u201d candidate u to be boosted in round 1 so that a chosen s becomes the first elimination, then run a two-type chain (pivot b vs c) on the reduced set C\\{s}. This yields a 3-variable LP (\u03b1 for c-first, \u03b2_b for b-first, \u03b2_u for u-first) with a closed-form, 1D minimization after eliminating \u03b1, \u03b2_b.\n- Derive a simpler two-type special case (only c-first and u-first) when b needs no help along the post-s chain (B^{(s)}(\u03b3) \u2264 0) and u stays well below b at the step where u is eliminated; this strictly improves upon the baseline chain two-type (c,b) certificate and explains the K=4 separation.\n- Give a data-driven certification algorithm (sample-splitting): identify a stable (s,u,b) and post-s chain from half the data, estimate only the needed tallies on the other half, and certify with O((log K + log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2) samples under verifiable margins.\n\nSet-up and notation\n- Fix target c, pivot b \u2260 c, steering candidate u \u2260 b,c, and desired first elimination s \u2260 b,c,u.\n- Slack \u03b3 > 0 enforces strict inequalities (ties irrelevant).\n- First round (S_1 = C) tallies: p_x := t_x(C).\n- Post-s chain on S^{(s)}_1 := C\\{s}: for j = 1,\u2026,K\u22123, let e^{(s)}_j := argmin_{e\u2208S^{(s)}_j\\{b,c}} t_e(S^{(s)}_j) with the election\u2019s tie-breaking; define S^{(s)}_{j+1} := S^{(s)}_j\\{e^{(s)}_j}. Let j_u be the unique j with e^{(s)}_j = u.\n- Define post-s deficits:\n  A^{(s)}(\u03b3) := max_{j} [t_{e^{(s)}_j}(S^{(s)}_j) \u2212 t_c(S^{(s)}_j) + \u03b3],\n  B^{(s)}(\u03b3) := max_{j} [t_{e^{(s)}_j}(S^{(s)}_j) \u2212 t_b(S^{(s)}_j) + \u03b3].\n  Note: no positive part; we keep signed values to avoid spurious constraints later.\n- First-round steering needs:\n  A_0 := [p_s \u2212 p_c + \u03b3]_+, B_0 := [p_s \u2212 p_b + \u03b3]_+, U_0 := [p_s \u2212 p_u + \u03b3]_+.\n- Final margin need: D := t_b({b,c}) \u2212 t_c({b,c}) + \u03b3.\n- At the step j_u where u is eliminated in the post-s chain, set a_u := t_u(S^{(s)}_{j_u}) \u2212 t_c(S^{(s)}_{j_u}) + \u03b3 and b_u := t_u(S^{(s)}_{j_u}) \u2212 t_b(S^{(s)}_{j_u}) + \u03b3 (signed).\n\nTheorem 1 (Three-type steering certificate; sufficient, general K).\nLet \u03b1, \u03b2_b, \u03b2_u \u2265 0 denote added masses of c-first, b-first, and u-first ballots, respectively. Assume the side-condition that for all w \u2208 C\\{s,b,c,u}, we have p_w \u2265 p_s + \u03b3 (so s can be made uniquely minimal without boosting w). If\n(i) \u03b2_u \u2265 U_0,\n(ii) \u03b1 \u2265 max{A_0, A^{(s)}(\u03b3), \u03b2_u + a_u},\n(iii) \u03b2_b \u2265 max{B_0, B^{(s)}(\u03b3), \u03b2_u + b_u}, and\n(iv) \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2_b + \u03b2_u \u2265 D,\nthen IRV eliminates s strictly at round 1, eliminates the post-s chain e^{(s)}_1,\u2026,e^{(s)}_{K\u22123} strictly, and elects c over b with strict final margin \u03b3. Hence c is an \u03b5-winner with \u03b5 \u2264 \u03b1 + \u03b2_b + \u03b2_u. Moreover, the minimal total mass over these three types is\n  \u03b5_{steer}(s,u,b;\u03b3) = min_{\u03b2_u \u2265 U_0} [ B\u0304(\u03b2_u) + max{ A\u0304(\u03b2_u), D + B\u0304(\u03b2_u) \u2212 \u03b2_u } + \u03b2_u ],\nwhere A\u0304(\u03b2_u) := max{A^*, \u03b2_u + a_u}, B\u0304(\u03b2_u) := max{B^*, \u03b2_u + b_u}, and A^* := max{A_0, A^{(s)}(\u03b3)}, B^* := max{B_0, B^{(s)}(\u03b3)}.\n\nProof.\n- Round 1: For x \u2208 {b,c,u}, t\u2019_x(C) = p_x + added_x; for w \u2209 {s,b,c,u}, t\u2019_w(C) = p_w. With (i)\u2013(iii), p_s \u2264 p_c + \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b3 and p_s \u2264 p_b + \u03b2_b \u2212 \u03b3 and p_s \u2264 p_u + \u03b2_u \u2212 \u03b3, while the side-condition gives p_s \u2264 p_w \u2212 \u03b3 for all other w. Hence s is uniquely minimal and eliminated.\n- Post-s chain: For each j, t\u2019_c(S^{(s)}_j) = t_c(S^{(s)}_j) + \u03b1, t\u2019_b = t_b + \u03b2_b, and t\u2019_{e^{(s)}_j} = t_{e^{(s)}_j} + 1_{e^{(s)}_j=u}\u03b2_u. Conditions (ii)\u2013(iii) enforce t\u2019_{e^{(s)}_j} \u2264 min{t\u2019_c, t\u2019_b} \u2212 \u03b3, so e^{(s)}_j remains the unique minimum and is eliminated.\n- Final: Each c-first increases t_c({b,c}) by 1; each b-first decreases the c-vs-b margin by 1; each u-first (with completion u \u227b c \u227b b) increases the final c-vs-b margin by 1. Condition (iv) yields t\u2019_c({b,c}) \u2265 t\u2019_b({b,c}) + \u03b3. Thus c wins. Minimization over \u03b1,\u03b2_b for fixed \u03b2_u is the same 2D linear form as before, yielding \u03b1 = max{A\u0304(\u03b2_u), D + B\u0304(\u03b2_u) \u2212 \u03b2_u} and \u03b2_b = B\u0304(\u03b2_u). This produces the one-dimensional objective in \u03b2_u; convexity and piecewise linearity ensure the minimum is achieved at a breakpoint.\n\nCorollary 2 (Two-type steering: c-first and u-first only).\nIf B^* \u2264 0 and b_u \u2264 \u2212U_0 (so the post-s chain needs no b-first mass and u\u2019s boost remains below b at j_u), then set \u03b2_b = 0. The minimal mass reduces to\n  \u03b5_{steer}^{(2)}(s,u;\u03b3) = min_{\u03b2_u \u2208 [U_0, U_{max}]} [ max{ A^*, \u03b2_u + a_u, D \u2212 \u03b2_u } + \u03b2_u ],\nwhere U_{max} := \u2212b_u (so that t\u2019_b(S^{(s)}_{j_u}) \u2212 t\u2019_u(S^{(s)}_{j_u}) \u2265 \u03b3 holds). The minimizer occurs at \u03b2_u \u2208 {U_0, U_{max}, \u03b2^*} with \u03b2^* solving \u03b2 + a_u = D \u2212 \u03b2 (if feasible), i.e., \u03b2^* = (D \u2212 a_u)/2.\n\nExample (K = 4 improved separation; explicit numbers and completions).\nTake C={a,b,c,d} with the profile from the notes (weights sum to 1):\n- 0.06: a \u227b b \u227b d \u227b c\n- 0.12: a \u227b d \u227b c \u227b b\n- 0.35: b \u227b a \u227b c \u227b d\n- 0.22: c \u227b b \u227b d \u227b a\n- 0.085: d \u227b c \u227b b \u227b a\n- 0.05: d \u227b a \u227b c \u227b b\n- 0.115: d \u227b b \u227b c \u227b a\nBaseline: p=(0.18,0.35,0.22,0.25); on S={b,c,d}: (0.41,0.22,0.37); on S={a,b,c}: (0.23,0.465,0.305); pair {b,c}: (0.525,0.475). Chain two-type (pivot b) gives \u03b5_chain = 0.15.\nChoose s=d, u=a, b pivot, \u03b3\u21920+, completions: u-first ballots as a \u227b c \u227b b \u227b d; c-first ballots as c \u227b b \u227b d \u227b a. Compute:\n- A^* = max{[0.25\u22120.22]_+, [0.23\u22120.305]} = max{0.03, \u22120.075} = 0.03.\n- B^* = max{[0.25\u22120.35]_+, [0.23\u22120.465]} = 0.\n- U_0 = [0.25\u22120.18]_+ = 0.07.\n- a_u = 0.23\u22120.305 = \u22120.075, b_u = 0.23\u22120.465 = \u22120.235.\n- D = 0.525\u22120.475 = 0.05.\nTwo-type (\u03b2_b=0) applies since B^* \u2264 0 and b_u \u2264 \u2212U_0. The objective is max{0.03, \u03b2_u\u22120.075, 0.05\u2212\u03b2_u} + \u03b2_u over \u03b2_u \u2208 [0.07, 0.235]. Optimal \u03b2_u is at \u03b2_u = 0.07 (since 0.05\u2212\u03b2_u becomes small), giving \u03b1 = max{0.03, \u22120.005, \u22120.02} = 0.03 and total \u03b5 = \u03b1 + \u03b2_u = 0.10. With tiny slack, take (\u03b2_u, \u03b1) \u2248 (0.0701, 0.0301), which strictly beats the chain two-type 0.15 and improves the previously stated 0.1202.\nVerification: Round 1: (a,b,c,d)\u2192(0.2501,0.35,0.2501,0.25) so d is uniquely minimal. Round 2 on {a,b,c}: (0.3001,0.465,0.3351), so a eliminated. Final {b,c}: margin = (0.475 + \u03b1 + \u03b2_u) \u2212 0.525 \u2248 0.0502 > 0.\n\nSampling (sample-splitting) for steering certificate\nWe adapt the chain-stability approach.\n- Stage I (discovery): Using m_1 samples, for each triple (s,u,b) with s,u \u2208 C\\{b,c}, s \u2260 u, compute empirical p_x, check the side-condition p_w \u2265 p_s + 4\u03c4 for all w \u2208 C\\{s,b,c,u}; build the empirical post-s chain and ensure its gaps \u2265 4\u03c4; identify j_u; compute signed A^{(s)}, B^{(s)}, a_u, b_u, D on the discovered sets.\n- Stage II (estimation): Using m_2 samples, re-estimate only the tallies on the selected triples\u2019 sets. Plug into \u03b5_{steer}(s,u,b;\u03b3) (or \u03b5_{steer}^{(2)} where applicable) and certify whenever the empirical cost \u2264 \u03b5 \u2212 c\u00b7\u03c4 with c \u2265 6.\nGuarantee (sketch): With m_i \u2265 C (log(K^4/\u03b4))/\u03c4^2, Hoeffding + union bound (over O(K^4) tallies for all feasible (s,u,b) chains) gives sup error \u2264 \u03c4. Side-condition and gap \u2265 4\u03c4 imply stability of (s,u,b) identities and post-s chain (by the same argument as in the prior chain-stability lemma). The maps (p_x, t_x(S)) \u21a6 \u03b5_{steer} are 1-Lipschitz per coordinate aggregation with a global sup-norm Lipschitz constant \u2264 6 (conservative), yielding |\\widehat{\u03b5} \u2212 \u03b5| \u2264 6\u03c4. Thus the decision is correct with probability \u2265 1 \u2212 \u03b4.\n\nRemarks and limits\n- Theorem 1 is sufficient, not necessary. It captures steering via one boosted non-{b,c} candidate u. Allowing multiple steering candidates (a small set T) yields an (|T|+2)-variable LP that can further reduce cost; the example suggests genuine benefits already at |T|=1.\n- Interactions: If u happens to be early in the post-s chain (j_u small), then \u03b2_u appears inside A\u0304 and B\u0304 only in that single step; our signed formulation avoids the earlier over-approximation that incorrectly forced \u03b2_b \u2265 \u03b2_u.\n- Computationally, evaluating \u03b5_{steer}^{(2)} reduces to minimizing a 1D convex piecewise-linear function over [U_0, U_{max}], done by checking breakpoints {U_0, U_{max}, (D \u2212 a_u)/2}.\n\nObstacles\n- Global search over (s,u,b) is O(K^3); sample-splitting confines uniform estimation to these O(K^3) chains but still inflates constants. A structural pruning (e.g., only s among a few bottom-first-round candidates, only u among a few near-s) would reduce complexity; proving such pruning preserves near-optimality is open.\n- Fixed-order LP sensitivity remains open; our certificates avoid this by working with explicit inequalities and local stability margins.\n- Lower bounds: a rigorous \u03a9((log K)/\u03b5^2) via Fano needs a concrete family {P_b} where only D_{b,c} differs by \u0398(\u03b5) across b while A^{(s)}, B^{(s)} stay within o(\u03b5); a Bradley\u2013Terry/Mallows tilt localized to pair {b,c} is promising, but verifying IRV-relevant tallies remain controlled across all S requires care.\n\nNext steps\n- Add Theorem 1 and the two-type special case (Cor. 2) to proofs.md; include the K=4 improved 0.10 separation with explicit completions.\n- Implement a small LP to search for (s,u,b) and compare \u03b5_{steer}^{(2)} against \u03b5_chain and the unrestricted fixed-order LP, to likely find more separations on K\u22654.\n- Formalize the sample-splitting certification with explicit constants and counting of tallies; add a flowchart for the hybrid certifier (c-first, K=3 exact, chain two-type, steering two-type).\n- Develop the Fano packing: instantiate {P_b} via independent pair-flips on {b,c} embedded into a symmetric base profile with A^{(s)} = B^{(s)} = 0, compute KL = O(\u03b5^2), and verify c\u2019s \u03b5-winner status differs by pivot.\n- Explore multi-steering (|T|=2) formulas; derive a tractable upper bound via sequential 1D minimizations or monotonicity lemmas to keep sampling polynomial."
