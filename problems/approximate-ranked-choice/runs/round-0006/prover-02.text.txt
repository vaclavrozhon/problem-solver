Ideas
- Extend the chain-based method by allowing a single “steering” candidate u to be boosted in round 1 so that a chosen s becomes the first elimination, then run a two-type chain (pivot b vs c) on the reduced set C\{s}. This yields a 3-variable LP (α for c-first, β_b for b-first, β_u for u-first) with a closed-form, 1D minimization after eliminating α, β_b.
- Derive a simpler two-type special case (only c-first and u-first) when b needs no help along the post-s chain (B^{(s)}(γ) ≤ 0) and u stays well below b at the step where u is eliminated; this strictly improves upon the baseline chain two-type (c,b) certificate and explains the K=4 separation.
- Give a data-driven certification algorithm (sample-splitting): identify a stable (s,u,b) and post-s chain from half the data, estimate only the needed tallies on the other half, and certify with O((log K + log(1/δ))/ε^2) samples under verifiable margins.

Set-up and notation
- Fix target c, pivot b ≠ c, steering candidate u ≠ b,c, and desired first elimination s ≠ b,c,u.
- Slack γ > 0 enforces strict inequalities (ties irrelevant).
- First round (S_1 = C) tallies: p_x := t_x(C).
- Post-s chain on S^{(s)}_1 := C\{s}: for j = 1,…,K−3, let e^{(s)}_j := argmin_{e∈S^{(s)}_j\{b,c}} t_e(S^{(s)}_j) with the election’s tie-breaking; define S^{(s)}_{j+1} := S^{(s)}_j\{e^{(s)}_j}. Let j_u be the unique j with e^{(s)}_j = u.
- Define post-s deficits:
  A^{(s)}(γ) := max_{j} [t_{e^{(s)}_j}(S^{(s)}_j) − t_c(S^{(s)}_j) + γ],
  B^{(s)}(γ) := max_{j} [t_{e^{(s)}_j}(S^{(s)}_j) − t_b(S^{(s)}_j) + γ].
  Note: no positive part; we keep signed values to avoid spurious constraints later.
- First-round steering needs:
  A_0 := [p_s − p_c + γ]_+, B_0 := [p_s − p_b + γ]_+, U_0 := [p_s − p_u + γ]_+.
- Final margin need: D := t_b({b,c}) − t_c({b,c}) + γ.
- At the step j_u where u is eliminated in the post-s chain, set a_u := t_u(S^{(s)}_{j_u}) − t_c(S^{(s)}_{j_u}) + γ and b_u := t_u(S^{(s)}_{j_u}) − t_b(S^{(s)}_{j_u}) + γ (signed).

Theorem 1 (Three-type steering certificate; sufficient, general K).
Let α, β_b, β_u ≥ 0 denote added masses of c-first, b-first, and u-first ballots, respectively. Assume the side-condition that for all w ∈ C\{s,b,c,u}, we have p_w ≥ p_s + γ (so s can be made uniquely minimal without boosting w). If
(i) β_u ≥ U_0,
(ii) α ≥ max{A_0, A^{(s)}(γ), β_u + a_u},
(iii) β_b ≥ max{B_0, B^{(s)}(γ), β_u + b_u}, and
(iv) α − β_b + β_u ≥ D,
then IRV eliminates s strictly at round 1, eliminates the post-s chain e^{(s)}_1,…,e^{(s)}_{K−3} strictly, and elects c over b with strict final margin γ. Hence c is an ε-winner with ε ≤ α + β_b + β_u. Moreover, the minimal total mass over these three types is
  ε_{steer}(s,u,b;γ) = min_{β_u ≥ U_0} [ B̄(β_u) + max{ Ā(β_u), D + B̄(β_u) − β_u } + β_u ],
where Ā(β_u) := max{A^*, β_u + a_u}, B̄(β_u) := max{B^*, β_u + b_u}, and A^* := max{A_0, A^{(s)}(γ)}, B^* := max{B_0, B^{(s)}(γ)}.

Proof.
- Round 1: For x ∈ {b,c,u}, t’_x(C) = p_x + added_x; for w ∉ {s,b,c,u}, t’_w(C) = p_w. With (i)–(iii), p_s ≤ p_c + α − γ and p_s ≤ p_b + β_b − γ and p_s ≤ p_u + β_u − γ, while the side-condition gives p_s ≤ p_w − γ for all other w. Hence s is uniquely minimal and eliminated.
- Post-s chain: For each j, t’_c(S^{(s)}_j) = t_c(S^{(s)}_j) + α, t’_b = t_b + β_b, and t’_{e^{(s)}_j} = t_{e^{(s)}_j} + 1_{e^{(s)}_j=u}β_u. Conditions (ii)–(iii) enforce t’_{e^{(s)}_j} ≤ min{t’_c, t’_b} − γ, so e^{(s)}_j remains the unique minimum and is eliminated.
- Final: Each c-first increases t_c({b,c}) by 1; each b-first decreases the c-vs-b margin by 1; each u-first (with completion u ≻ c ≻ b) increases the final c-vs-b margin by 1. Condition (iv) yields t’_c({b,c}) ≥ t’_b({b,c}) + γ. Thus c wins. Minimization over α,β_b for fixed β_u is the same 2D linear form as before, yielding α = max{Ā(β_u), D + B̄(β_u) − β_u} and β_b = B̄(β_u). This produces the one-dimensional objective in β_u; convexity and piecewise linearity ensure the minimum is achieved at a breakpoint.

Corollary 2 (Two-type steering: c-first and u-first only).
If B^* ≤ 0 and b_u ≤ −U_0 (so the post-s chain needs no b-first mass and u’s boost remains below b at j_u), then set β_b = 0. The minimal mass reduces to
  ε_{steer}^{(2)}(s,u;γ) = min_{β_u ∈ [U_0, U_{max}]} [ max{ A^*, β_u + a_u, D − β_u } + β_u ],
where U_{max} := −b_u (so that t’_b(S^{(s)}_{j_u}) − t’_u(S^{(s)}_{j_u}) ≥ γ holds). The minimizer occurs at β_u ∈ {U_0, U_{max}, β^*} with β^* solving β + a_u = D − β (if feasible), i.e., β^* = (D − a_u)/2.

Example (K = 4 improved separation; explicit numbers and completions).
Take C={a,b,c,d} with the profile from the notes (weights sum to 1):
- 0.06: a ≻ b ≻ d ≻ c
- 0.12: a ≻ d ≻ c ≻ b
- 0.35: b ≻ a ≻ c ≻ d
- 0.22: c ≻ b ≻ d ≻ a
- 0.085: d ≻ c ≻ b ≻ a
- 0.05: d ≻ a ≻ c ≻ b
- 0.115: d ≻ b ≻ c ≻ a
Baseline: p=(0.18,0.35,0.22,0.25); on S={b,c,d}: (0.41,0.22,0.37); on S={a,b,c}: (0.23,0.465,0.305); pair {b,c}: (0.525,0.475). Chain two-type (pivot b) gives ε_chain = 0.15.
Choose s=d, u=a, b pivot, γ→0+, completions: u-first ballots as a ≻ c ≻ b ≻ d; c-first ballots as c ≻ b ≻ d ≻ a. Compute:
- A^* = max{[0.25−0.22]_+, [0.23−0.305]} = max{0.03, −0.075} = 0.03.
- B^* = max{[0.25−0.35]_+, [0.23−0.465]} = 0.
- U_0 = [0.25−0.18]_+ = 0.07.
- a_u = 0.23−0.305 = −0.075, b_u = 0.23−0.465 = −0.235.
- D = 0.525−0.475 = 0.05.
Two-type (β_b=0) applies since B^* ≤ 0 and b_u ≤ −U_0. The objective is max{0.03, β_u−0.075, 0.05−β_u} + β_u over β_u ∈ [0.07, 0.235]. Optimal β_u is at β_u = 0.07 (since 0.05−β_u becomes small), giving α = max{0.03, −0.005, −0.02} = 0.03 and total ε = α + β_u = 0.10. With tiny slack, take (β_u, α) ≈ (0.0701, 0.0301), which strictly beats the chain two-type 0.15 and improves the previously stated 0.1202.
Verification: Round 1: (a,b,c,d)→(0.2501,0.35,0.2501,0.25) so d is uniquely minimal. Round 2 on {a,b,c}: (0.3001,0.465,0.3351), so a eliminated. Final {b,c}: margin = (0.475 + α + β_u) − 0.525 ≈ 0.0502 > 0.

Sampling (sample-splitting) for steering certificate
We adapt the chain-stability approach.
- Stage I (discovery): Using m_1 samples, for each triple (s,u,b) with s,u ∈ C\{b,c}, s ≠ u, compute empirical p_x, check the side-condition p_w ≥ p_s + 4τ for all w ∈ C\{s,b,c,u}; build the empirical post-s chain and ensure its gaps ≥ 4τ; identify j_u; compute signed A^{(s)}, B^{(s)}, a_u, b_u, D on the discovered sets.
- Stage II (estimation): Using m_2 samples, re-estimate only the tallies on the selected triples’ sets. Plug into ε_{steer}(s,u,b;γ) (or ε_{steer}^{(2)} where applicable) and certify whenever the empirical cost ≤ ε − c·τ with c ≥ 6.
Guarantee (sketch): With m_i ≥ C (log(K^4/δ))/τ^2, Hoeffding + union bound (over O(K^4) tallies for all feasible (s,u,b) chains) gives sup error ≤ τ. Side-condition and gap ≥ 4τ imply stability of (s,u,b) identities and post-s chain (by the same argument as in the prior chain-stability lemma). The maps (p_x, t_x(S)) ↦ ε_{steer} are 1-Lipschitz per coordinate aggregation with a global sup-norm Lipschitz constant ≤ 6 (conservative), yielding |\widehat{ε} − ε| ≤ 6τ. Thus the decision is correct with probability ≥ 1 − δ.

Remarks and limits
- Theorem 1 is sufficient, not necessary. It captures steering via one boosted non-{b,c} candidate u. Allowing multiple steering candidates (a small set T) yields an (|T|+2)-variable LP that can further reduce cost; the example suggests genuine benefits already at |T|=1.
- Interactions: If u happens to be early in the post-s chain (j_u small), then β_u appears inside Ā and B̄ only in that single step; our signed formulation avoids the earlier over-approximation that incorrectly forced β_b ≥ β_u.
- Computationally, evaluating ε_{steer}^{(2)} reduces to minimizing a 1D convex piecewise-linear function over [U_0, U_{max}], done by checking breakpoints {U_0, U_{max}, (D − a_u)/2}.

Obstacles
- Global search over (s,u,b) is O(K^3); sample-splitting confines uniform estimation to these O(K^3) chains but still inflates constants. A structural pruning (e.g., only s among a few bottom-first-round candidates, only u among a few near-s) would reduce complexity; proving such pruning preserves near-optimality is open.
- Fixed-order LP sensitivity remains open; our certificates avoid this by working with explicit inequalities and local stability margins.
- Lower bounds: a rigorous Ω((log K)/ε^2) via Fano needs a concrete family {P_b} where only D_{b,c} differs by Θ(ε) across b while A^{(s)}, B^{(s)} stay within o(ε); a Bradley–Terry/Mallows tilt localized to pair {b,c} is promising, but verifying IRV-relevant tallies remain controlled across all S requires care.

Next steps
- Add Theorem 1 and the two-type special case (Cor. 2) to proofs.md; include the K=4 improved 0.10 separation with explicit completions.
- Implement a small LP to search for (s,u,b) and compare ε_{steer}^{(2)} against ε_chain and the unrestricted fixed-order LP, to likely find more separations on K≥4.
- Formalize the sample-splitting certification with explicit constants and counting of tallies; add a flowchart for the hybrid certifier (c-first, K=3 exact, chain two-type, steering two-type).
- Develop the Fano packing: instantiate {P_b} via independent pair-flips on {b,c} embedded into a symmetric base profile with A^{(s)} = B^{(s)} = 0, compute KL = O(ε^2), and verify c’s ε-winner status differs by pivot.
- Explore multi-steering (|T|=2) formulas; derive a tractable upper bound via sequential 1D minimizations or monotonicity lemmas to keep sampling polynomial.
