  "content": "# Ideas\n\n- K=4 few-type steering scheme: Add three ballot types (c-first, b-first, and x-first for the remaining nonpivot a) to force a chosen candidate y to be eliminated in round 1, then ensure an eventual c-over-b final. This gives a small LP (3 variables) that can strictly beat the chain two-type bound.\n- Correct and sharpen the K=4 separation example with a minimal mass close to 0.10 (improving the earlier 0.1202), and present the general 3-variable LP constraints explicitly.\n- Sampling for K=4 steering LP: only nine tallies are needed (four first-round, three on {a,b,c}, and two pairwise for {b,c}), giving m = \u0398((log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2) via Hoeffding + union bound.\n\n# K=4 three-type steering LP (target c, pivot b, force y eliminated first)\n\nSetup. Let C = {a,b,c,y}, target winner c, pivot b (final opponent), and a the remaining nonpivot. Let first-round shares p_x := t_x(C). Let S_2 := {a,b,c} be the set after removing y, with tallies s_x := t_x(S_2) for x \u2208 S_2. Let D_{b,c}(\u03b3) := t_b({b,c}) \u2212 t_c({b,c}) + \u03b3. We add three nonnegative amounts: \u03b1 (c-first), \u03b2 (b-first), \u03b7 (a-first). All inequalities include a strictness slack \u03b3 > 0; we will let \u03b3 \u2192 0^+ after deriving formulas.\n\nConstraints.\n- Round 1 (force y eliminated): for all x \u2208 {a,b,c},\n  p_x + inc_x \u2265 p_y + \u03b3, where inc_a = \u03b7, inc_b = \u03b2, inc_c = \u03b1.\nEquivalently, \u03b1 \u2265 d_c, \u03b2 \u2265 d_b, \u03b7 \u2265 d_a, with\n  d_c := [p_y \u2212 p_c + \u03b3]_+, d_b := [p_y \u2212 p_b + \u03b3]_+, d_a := [p_y \u2212 p_a + \u03b3]_+.\n- Round 2 on S_2 = {a,b,c} (ensure a is eliminated):\n  s_a + \u03b7 \u2264 s_b + \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3  and  s_a + \u03b7 \u2264 s_c + \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b3,\ni.e., \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2264 s_b \u2212 s_a \u2212 \u03b3 and \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2265 s_a \u2212 s_c + \u03b3.\n- Final {b,c} (ensure c beats b):\n  (t_c \u2212 t_b) + (\u03b1 + \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b2) \u2265 \u03b3 \u21d4 \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 + \u03b7 \u2265 D_{b,c}(\u03b3).\n\nObjective: minimize \u03b1 + \u03b2 + \u03b7 subject to the five linear constraints above.\n\nProposition (sound K=4 certificate). Any feasible (\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b7) for the above LP yields an augmentation that eliminates y in round 1, then eliminates a in round 2, and finally elects c over b by \u2265\u03b3. The LP optimum is a valid upper bound on the minimal augmentation \u03b5^*(\u03b3;c). Taking \u03b3 \u2192 0^+ gives a sound certificate for \u03b5^*(c).\n\nProof. Round-1 feasibility ensures y is strictly below a, b, c in S_1, hence is eliminated first. The S_2 constraints ensure a is strictly below b and c in S_2 and is eliminated second. The final {b,c} constraint ensures a strict c-over-b head-to-head win. The objective is total added mass; feasibility implies correctness.\n\nSpecial case simplification. If d_b = 0 (b already above y in round 1) and s_b \u2212 s_a \u2265 \u03b3 (so a is already below b in S_2), then (\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2264 s_b \u2212 s_a \u2212 \u03b3) is slack for \u03b2 \u2265 0 and small \u03b3. In this case, the LP reduces to minimizing \u03b1 + \u03b7 subject to \u03b1 \u2265 d_c, \u03b7 \u2265 d_a, \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2265 s_a \u2212 s_c + \u03b3, and \u03b1 + \u03b7 \u2265 D_{b,c}(\u03b3). The optimum is\n  \u03b1 + \u03b7 = max{ d_a + d_c, D_{b,c}(\u03b3), (s_a \u2212 s_c + \u03b3) + 2 max{ d_a \u2212 (s_a \u2212 s_c + \u03b3), 0 } }.\nIn particular, when s_c \u2265 s_a + \u03b3 (so the second-round a-vs-c gap is nonnegative), this simplifies to \u03b1 + \u03b7 = max{ d_a + d_c, D_{b,c}(\u03b3) }.\n\nRemark. This reveals when steering pays off: if \u201cthe sum of first-round deficits to pass y\u201d (d_a + d_c) is below the chain two-type A_b, the steering LP can beat the chain bound; if additionally D_{b,c} is small, the final constraint is slack.\n\n# Corrected K=4 separation example (improved)\n\nProfile (C = {a,b,c,d}). Ballot types and masses:\n- 0.06: a \u227b b \u227b d \u227b c\n- 0.12: a \u227b d \u227b c \u227b b\n- 0.35: b \u227b a \u227b c \u227b d\n- 0.22: c \u227b b \u227b d \u227b a\n- 0.085: d \u227b c \u227b b \u227b a\n- 0.05: d \u227b a \u227b c \u227b b\n- 0.115: d \u227b b \u227b c \u227b a\nFirst-round: (p_a,p_b,p_c,p_d)=(0.18,0.35,0.22,0.25). If a is removed: S={b,c,d}\u2192(0.41,0.22,0.37). If d is removed: S={a,b,c}\u2192(s_a,s_b,s_c)=(0.23,0.465,0.305). Pairwise {b,c}: t_c=0.475, t_b=0.525.\n\nChain two-type (pivot b). e_1=a (min of {a,d}), S_2={b,c,d}, e_2=c vs d: min is c? Given (0.41,0.22,0.37) the minimal is c at 0.22? Wait S={b,c,d} tallies provided are (0.41,0.22,0.37); so e_2=c. Then A_b(0)=max{[0.18\u22120.22]_+, [0.22\u22120.41]_+, [0.22\u22120.37]_+}=max{0, 0, 0}=0? This contradicts earlier summary that A_b(0)=0.15. The earlier chain computed via removing a then S2={b,c,d} tallies was (0.41,0.22,0.37). However the definition of A_b takes max_j [ t_{e_j}(S_j) \u2212 t_c(S_j) ]_+. Here c\u2208S_2 with tally 0.22 equals the loser; A_b must capture the round-1 deficit against a (S_1=C: t_a\u2212t_c = 0.18\u22120.22 = \u22120.04\u21920) and round-2 deficit against e_2=c itself (t_{e_2}\u2212t_c = 0.22\u22120.22 = 0). This yields A_b=0, contradicting the stated 0.15. The discrepancy stems from the chain being computed for pivot b with S_2={b,c,d}: the relevant \u201cother\u201d at round 2 is the minimal among S_2\\{b,c}={d}, i.e., e_2=d, not c. Then A_b picks [t_d(S_2)\u2212t_c(S_2)]_+ = 0.37\u22120.22=0.15. Hence the chain is e_1=a, e_2=d as stated in prior rounds, and A_b(0)=0.15, B_b(0)=0, D_{b,c}=0.05, total \u03b5_b^*=0.15.\n\nImproved steering plan. Target y=d first and then final {b,c} with c winner. Use two types:\n- \u03b7 of a-first ballots with completion a \u227b c \u227b b \u227b d (so they count towards c in {b,c}).\n- \u03b1 of c-first ballots.\nTake \u03b3\u21920 and choose minimal\n  \u03b7 \u2265 d_a = p_d \u2212 p_a = 0.07,\n  \u03b1 \u2265 d_c = p_d \u2212 p_c = 0.03,\n  \u03b1 + \u03b7 \u2265 D_{b,c} = 0.05.\nA feasible choice is \u03b7 = 0.0701, \u03b1 = 0.0301, \u03b2=0, giving total mass 0.1002 < 0.15. Verify:\n- Round 1: (a,b,c,d)\u2192(0.2501, 0.35, 0.2501, 0.25); d is uniquely minimal.\n- Round 2 on {a,b,c}: (a,b,c)\u2192(0.3001, 0.465, 0.3351); a is eliminated.\n- Final {b,c}: (t_c \u2212 t_b) + (\u03b1+\u03b7) = (0.475\u22120.525)+0.1002 = 0.0502 > 0, so c wins.\nThus the chain two-type bound 0.15 is not tight; the three-type steering LP yields \u2264 0.1002 (and in fact approaches 0.10 as \u03b3\u21920^+).\n\n# Sampling for the K=4 steering LP\n\nQuantities to estimate (9 total): first-round p_a,p_b,p_c,p_y; S_2 tallies s_a,s_b,s_c; pairwise t_c({b,c}), t_b({b,c}). Hoeffding + union bound gives that m = \u0398((log(9/\u03b4))/\u03c4^2) suffices to uniformly approximate these to \u00b1\u03c4. The LP value is piecewise-linear with a global sup-norm Lipschitz constant L \u2264 8 (each constraint involves at most two tallies; the objective is \u03b1+\u03b2+\u03b7), so the plug-in decision \u201cdeclare c an \u03b5-winner if the empirical LP optimum \u2264 \u03b5 \u2212 L\u03c4\u201d is correct with probability \u2265 1\u2212\u03b4. Choosing \u03c4 = \u0398(\u03b5) yields m = \u0398((log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2).\n\nRemark (data-driven strictness). Use a small \u03b3 proportional to \u03c4 to enforce strict separations, e.g., \u03b3 = 3\u03c4, so that sampling error does not flip the required inequalities.\n\n# Relations to existing bounds\n\n- Round\u20111 + Final lower bound L_b(\u03b3) applies here with pivot b and gives L_b(0) = max{d_b + max{d_a,d_c}, D_{b,c}} \u2264 \u03b5_b^{(chain)} and \u2264 \u03b5_{y}^{(steer)}. In the example, L_b(0) = max{0, 0.05} = 0.05, much below both constructive certificates.\n- Chain two-type bound \u03b5_b^*(\u03b3) uses only c- and b-first ballots and the baseline chain; the K=4 steering LP augments with a-first to alter the early path, strictly improving the bound.\n\n# Obstacles\n\n- General closed form beyond the simple special case requires enumerating LP vertices; while tractable, the casework is messy. A clean necessary-and-sufficient symbolic expression (like K=3) may be impractical.\n- Extending few-type steering beyond K=4 (e.g., forcing two early eliminations using \u22644 types) while keeping sampling polynomial and the analysis clean is nontrivial.\n- Dual sensitivity for the fixed-order LP remains open; no new progress here.\n\n# Next steps\n\n- Formalize the K=4 steering LP theorem and the improved example in proofs.md; add a short routine to compute the LP value in closed form by checking a finite set of candidate vertices.\n- Implement a hybrid certifier: for K=4, take the minimum among (i) c-first M_c, (ii) chain two-type for each pivot, and (iii) steering LP for each choice of y and pivot b. Sampling requires estimating a constant number of tallies per candidate pair (overall O(K^2)).\n- Attempt a K\u22654 construction where four types (c-first, b-first, and two steering types) are necessary to beat both chain and K=4 three-type bounds.\n- Proceed with the Fano/packing lower bound: instantiate the \u201cshielded blocks\u201d so that only D_{b,c} varies across b, keeping p and S_2 tallies fixed, yielding m = \u03a9((log K)/\u03b5^2) to identify a favorable pivot.\n"
