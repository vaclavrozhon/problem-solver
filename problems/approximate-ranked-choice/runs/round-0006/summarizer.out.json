Main outcomes: a distribution-free c-first sufficient certificate M_c with plug-in sampling (m = \u0398((K+log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2)); an exact K=3 two-type minimal-augmentation formula (five tallies; m = \u0398((log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2)); a general-K chain-based two-type certificate (pivot b) computable from O(K) subset tallies and certifiable under a verifiable chain-stability margin with m = \u0398((log K + log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2); an LP fixed-order primal/dual exactly characterizes minimal augmentation but the dual 1-norm sensitivity R_K remains open; and a K=4 steering/separation example shows the chain two-type bound is not tight (few-type steering can strictly reduce required mass).

    "General-K chain-based two-type certificate (pivot b): \u03b5_b^*=B_b+max{A_b,B_b+D_{b,c}}; depends on O(K) tallies and certifiable under chain-stability with m = \u0398((log K+log(1/\u03b4))/\u03b5^2).",
    "LP fixed-order primal/dual gives exact optimum but dual-sensitivity constant R_K (sup ||\u03bb||_1) lacks a poly(K) bound\u2014open problem for polynomial sample guarantees.",
    "K\u22654 separation: a concrete K=4 profile shows steering with an extra added-top type (beyond {c,pivot}) can reduce required mass (\u22480.1002 vs chain bound 0.15), so chain two-type is not tight."
