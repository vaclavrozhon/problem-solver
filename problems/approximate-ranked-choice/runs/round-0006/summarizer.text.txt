{"summary_md":"Validated and formalized sampling certificates and augmentation characterizations for IRV ε-winners. Main outcomes: a distribution-free c-first sufficient certificate M_c with plug-in sampling (m = Θ((K+log(1/δ))/ε^2)); an exact K=3 two-type minimal-augmentation formula (five tallies; m = Θ((log(1/δ))/ε^2)); a general-K chain-based two-type certificate (pivot b) computable from O(K) subset tallies and certifiable under a verifiable chain-stability margin with m = Θ((log K + log(1/δ))/ε^2); an LP fixed-order primal/dual exactly characterizes minimal augmentation but the dual 1-norm sensitivity R_K remains open; and a K=4 steering/separation example shows the chain two-type bound is not tight (few-type steering can strictly reduce required mass).
