The sampling story via sample-splitting remains clean and polynomial.\\n\\n- Prover 1: Your K=4 steering-with-two-types lemma (targeted path d\u2192a using {c,a}) is correct as stated, with a precise 1D minimization f(\u03b2)=\u03b2+max{LB_\u03b1, D\u2212\u03b2, \u03b2\u2212U_c} over \u03b2\u2208[LB_\u03b2,U_b]. The tightened instance (\u03b1\u22480.0301, \u03b2_a\u22480.0701) achieving \u22480.1002 mass (improving on 0.1202) is consistent and fully checks out; well done. Please keep explicit the a-first completion (a \u227b c \u227b b \u227b d) so the pairwise bc margin contribution is clear. Your Fano sketch is on-point; formalize KL constants.\\n- Prover 2: The three-type steering certificate (\u03b1 for c-first, \u03b2_b for b-first, \u03b2_u for u-first) with the envelope A\u0304(\u03b2_u), B\u0304(\u03b2_u) and 1D minimization in \u03b2_u is sound. The side-condition p_w \u2265 p_s+\u03b3 to isolate s as the first elimination is important and correctly used. The sample-splitting algorithm over (s,u,b) triples is viable; account explicitly for O(K^3) chains in the union bound and keep the global plug-in margin \u22656\u03c4 (your constants are conservative and acceptable).\\n- Prover 3: Your three-type steering theorem (with y-first steering and path over S2\u2032) is consistent with P2 and provides a clear closed form \u03b5_steer via \u03b2_y^*. The nondecreasing E(\u03b2_y) argument is correct. The Lipschitz bound L \u2264 8 is conservative but safe. Ensure the chain-identification step on a held-out sample is explicit; do not assume access to true chain tallies without the stability check.\\n- Prover 4: The K=4 three-variable LP is a clear, auditable formulation and matches the improved example (\u22480.1002). Good catch on the chain e2 identity; the correction (e2=d) restores A_b=0.15. Your sampling bound over 9 tallies for K=4 is sharp.\\n\\nBlocking items: (i) fixed-order LP dual sensitivity remains open; avoid the earlier flawed K or K\u22121 bounds; (ii) formalize the Fano-style \u03a9((log K)/\u03b5^2) lower bound with a concrete packed family; (iii) general few-type steering beyond one steering candidate needs systematic analysis and sampling bounds.\\n\\nNext steps: (1) Add the three-type steering certificate (general K) and its sampling corollary to proofs.md; (2) record the K=4 closed-form two-type steering lemma and the improved 0.1002 separation; (3) finalize a Fano packing with explicit KL; (4) implement a hybrid certifier (K=3 exact; chain two-type under stability; steering (two/three-type) where applicable; c-first fallback) with unified sample guarantees.\",\"summary_md\":\"We added a general three-type steering certificate (c-, pivot-, and steering-candidate-first) with a 1D closed-form minimization and polynomial sample-splitting certification.
