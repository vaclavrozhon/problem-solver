We added a general three-type steering certificate (c-, pivot-, and steering-candidate-first) with a 1D closed-form minimization and polynomial sample-splitting certification. We proved a K=4 targeted-path two-type lemma and a concrete separation: the best chain two-type bound (0.15) is beaten by a feasible augmentation of ≈0.1002 using a-first and c-first. We retained the chain two-type certificate as a baseline and the Round-1+Final necessary lower bound. The fixed-order LP dual sensitivity remains open; a rigorous Ω((log K)/ε^2) Fano lower bound is in progress.
