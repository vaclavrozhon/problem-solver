{"feedback_md":"Strong advances this round: we now have a rigorous steering framework that (a) subsumes the chain-based two-type certificate and (b) exhibits a concrete K=4 separation where steering strictly improves the required mass. The sampling story via sample-splitting remains clean and polynomial.\n\n- Prover 1: Your K=4 steering-with-two-types lemma (targeted path d→a using {c,a}) is correct as stated, with a precise 1D minimization f(β)=β+max{LB_α, D−β, β−U_c} over β∈[LB_β,U_b]. The tightened instance (α≈0.0301, β_a≈0.0701) achieving ≈0.1002 mass (improving on 0.1202) is consistent and fully checks out; well done. Please keep explicit the a-first completion (a ≻ c ≻ b ≻ d) so the pairwise bc margin contribution is clear. Your Fano sketch is on-point; formalize KL constants.\n- Prover 2: The three-type steering certificate (α for c-first, β_b for b-first, β_u for u-first) with the envelope Ā(β_u), B̄(β_u) and 1D minimization in β_u is sound. The side-condition p_w ≥ p_s+γ to isolate s as the first elimination is important and correctly used. The sample-splitting algorithm over (s,u,b) triples is viable; account explicitly for O(K^3) chains in the union bound and keep the global plug-in margin ≥6τ (your constants are conservative and acceptable).\n- Prover 3: Your three-type steering theorem (with y-first steering and path over S2′) is consistent with P2 and provides a clear closed form ε_steer via β_y^*. The nondecreasing E(β_y) argument is correct. The Lipschitz bound L ≤ 8 is conservative but safe. Ensure the chain-identification step on a held-out sample is explicit; do not assume access to true chain tallies without the stability check.\n- Prover 4: The K=4 three-variable LP is a clear, auditable formulation and matches the improved example (≈0.1002). Good catch on the chain e2 identity; the correction (e2=d) restores A_b=0.15. Your sampling bound over 9 tallies for K=4 is sharp.\n\nBlocking items: (i) fixed-order LP dual sensitivity remains open; avoid the earlier flawed K or K−1 bounds; (ii) formalize the Fano-style Ω((log K)/ε^2) lower bound with a concrete packed family; (iii) general few-type steering beyond one steering candidate needs systematic analysis and sampling bounds.\n\nNext steps: (1) Add the three-type steering certificate (general K) and its sampling corollary to proofs.md; (2) record the K=4 closed-form two-type steering lemma and the improved 0.1002 separation; (3) finalize a Fano packing with explicit KL; (4) implement a hybrid certifier (K=3 exact; chain two-type under stability; steering (two/three-type) where applicable; c-first fallback) with unified sample guarantees.","summary_md":"We added a general three-type steering certificate (c-, pivot-, and steering-candidate-first) with a 1D closed-form minimization and polynomial sample-splitting certification.
