  "summary_md": "This round established core structural lemmas for finite Whitney triangulations of the disk and proved several small k-null cases. Main verified facts: G is K4-free, so maximal cliques of the primal are exactly the facial triangles; the link of any interior vertex is a chordless cycle, forcing interior degree \u22654; for an interior vertex v the incident-face set T(v) is a maximal clique in kG; any interior face t with all three edges interior yields N(t) (t plus the three adjacent faces) which induces a maximal K4 in kG; and kG is connected when G has \u22652 faces. k-nullness was proved for fans (one interior vertex), the two-triangle disk, and the hexagon-with-central-triangle (k^2G \u2245 K1). Remaining major gaps are a full classification of maximal cliques of kG (conjecture: every non-star maximal clique is some N(t)) and a completed ear-removal induction for the outerplanar case.
