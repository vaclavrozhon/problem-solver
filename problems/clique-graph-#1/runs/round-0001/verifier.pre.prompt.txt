You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md, proofs.md, and output.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers
- notes.md (informal progress & exploratory work so far)
- proofs.md (rigorous proofs & detailed mathematics so far)
- output.md (main results found so far)

**Three-tier file system guidelines**:
- **notes.md**: Readable, log of exploratory work, intuitions, failed attempts, ideas. Prefer appending. Replace only if old notes are clearly misleading. It should be self-contained: In particular, reading it should make sense without knowing the output of provers in past rounds. 

- **proofs.md**: Complete rigorous mathematical proofs with full details. Think twice before adding anything. Contains proven lemmas, theorems, and detailed derivations. Only add mathematically verified content here.
- **output.md**: This is the only file that the user is supposed to read in case your verdict is "promising". It has to be self-contained. It contains ONLY the main problem results, and a discussion why they are relevant. It is extremely selective. Think twice before promoting proofs from proofs.md to output.md. Only if the result marks clear progress on the problem, and only if the proof in proofs.md has been thoroughly vetted by provers and you, it can join output.md. Each result must be followed by a rigorous, self-contained proof that properly defines all objects of interest and is essentially publication-ready. 

Tasks:
1) Audit rigor: identify unjustified steps, false statements, missing lemmas; produce minimal counterexamples.
2) Triage value: separate genuine progress from noise.

Problem 7. Clique Dynamics of Whitney triangulations
(suggested by Anna Margarethe Limbach)
Source: Proposed by F. Larrión, V. Neumann-Lara, and M. A.
Pizaña in 2002 [4].
Definitions.
• Given a graph G, its clique graph kG is the intersection graph
of its maximal complete subgraphs, called cliques. This means the
set of cliques of G is the vertex set of kG, and two vertices of kG
are adjacent if and only if they intersect non-trivially as cliques.
The operator k that maps each graph to its clique graph is called the
clique graph operator, and one can apply it iteratively to generate
the sequence of iterated clique graphs k
0G = G, k
1G = kG, k
2G =
k(kG), k
3G, . . ..
• If the sequence of iterated clique graphs of a graph G consists of
pairwise non-isomorphic graphs, G is called k-divergent, otherwise,
k-convergent, and if it contains the graph that consists of a singleton
(and then becomes stationary there) G is called k-null.
• A graph is called locally cyclic, if each open neighbourhood of a
vertex induces a cycle.
• A Whitney-triangulation of a compact surface is a triangulation
such that each triangle of its underlying graph is a face of the
surface. Whitney triangulations of closed surfaces are locally cyclic
with minimum degree ≥ 3 and the only one with minimum degree 3
is the K4 that triangulates the sphere.
From another perspective one can start with such a locally cyclic
graph and obtain a closed surface by “filling in the triangles”.

Question
Is the underlying graph of a finite Whitney triangulation of
the disk always k-null?



11
Related results:
• The K4 is k-null.
• The octahedron graph is k-divergent.
• The icosahedron graph is k-divergent.
• All locally cyclic graphs with minimum degree ≥ 7 are k-convergent.
• Every closed surface admits a k-divergent Whitney triangulation.
• Every closed surface with negative Euler characteristic admits a
k-convergent Whitney triangulation.
• Every Whitney triangulation of the disk such that every interior
vertex has degree ≥ 6 is k-null.

Ideas
- Recast kG for Whitney triangulations. For a finite Whitney triangulation G of a disk, every maximal clique of G is a face (triangle); hence V(kG) ≅ F(G). Two faces are adjacent in kG if and only if they share a vertex. Equivalently, kG is obtained by taking, for each vertex v ∈ V(G), the set T(v) of faces incident to v and making T(v) a clique, then taking the union over all v.
- The central structural problem is to understand the maximal cliques of kG. Trivial cliques come from stars T(v) around vertices v, but there are also cliques that do not have a common vertex (e.g., for an interior face t=abc, the set {t} together with the three faces adjacent across ab, bc, ca).
- Goal: Classify maximal cliques of kG in Whitney disk triangulations. As a consequence, attempt k^2-structure and k-nullness in special families (notably outerplanar triangulations and fans). Provide rigorous lemmas and special-case proofs.

Basic facts and clean lemmas
Lemma 1 (No K4 in a disk Whitney triangulation; maximal cliques of G are triangles). Let G be the underlying graph of a finite Whitney triangulation of a disk. Then G has no K4 subgraph. Consequently, the maximal cliques of G are exactly the triangular faces.
Proof. Since every 3-cycle in G bounds a face, a K4 subgraph would force its four 3-cycles to be faces. Each of the six edges of K4 belongs to exactly two of these four faces; hence these six edges cannot be incident with any other face of the triangulation. Thus K4 would be a closed component of the 2-complex, contradicting that we triangulate a connected disk with nonempty boundary. Therefore no K4 occurs. Every edge of G is contained in a face, so no edge is a maximal clique; and since K4 is forbidden, a triangle cannot be contained in a larger clique. ∎

Notation. For a vertex v of G, let T(v) be the set of faces incident to v. For a face t with edges e1, e2, e3, denote by N(t) the set consisting of t itself together with, for each interior edge ei of t, the unique other face across ei. Thus |N(t)| ∈ {2,3,4} depending on how many edges of t are interior.

Lemma 2 (Vertex-stars yield cliques; their maximality). Let v be an interior vertex of G.
- T(v) is a clique in kG.
- If deg(v) ≥ 4, then T(v) is a maximal clique of kG.
- If deg(v) = 3 with N(v) = {a,b,c}, then T(v) ∪ {abc} is a clique of size 4 and is the unique maximal clique containing T(v).
Proof. The first claim: any two faces in T(v) meet at v, so they are adjacent in kG. For maximality when deg(v) ≥ 4: the open neighborhood induced by N(v) in G is a chordless cycle; in particular, among neighbors of v there are no chords (else some neighbor-edge would be in ≥3 faces). A face f not containing v has only three vertices, so it cannot meet all faces in T(v): indeed f could meet at most three consecutive faces around v, but when deg(v) ≥ 4 there exist faces in T(v) disjoint from those three vertices. Hence T(v) is maximal. For deg(v) = 3, the neighbors a,b,c form a triangle abc, which is necessarily a face. Then T(v) ∪ {abc} is a 4-clique in kG. Any face not containing v and meeting all three faces (vab),(vbc),(vca) must contain at least two of {a,b,c}, hence would be abc itself; thus the 4-clique is maximal. ∎

Lemma 3 (Triangular 4-cliques). If t is an interior face (all three edges interior), then N(t) has size 4 and induces a K4 in kG. Moreover, N(t) is a maximal clique of kG.
Proof. The three faces across the edges of t each share an edge with t and pairwise meet at the three vertices of t, so N(t) is a clique. If a face f ∉ N(t) met all faces in N(t), then f would meet each of the three edge-neighbors of t; since those three meet pairwise only at the vertices of t, f would have to contain at least two vertices of t to meet all three — impossible unless f=t, contradiction. Thus N(t) is maximal. ∎

Remark. For boundary faces t (with some boundary edge), N(t) is a clique of size 2 or 3; whether it is maximal depends on local degrees at the edge-neighbors.

Consequence (bounded non-star cliques). Any clique in kG that does not have a common vertex has size at most 4, and equality implies it is of the form N(t) for an interior face t.
Sketch. Let S be a clique with no common vertex. Choose t ∈ S minimizing the number of boundary edges; then each f ∈ S must meet t. If S contains a face f not sharing an edge with t, then f meets t in exactly one vertex. With two distinct such faces f1,f2 ∈ S meeting t in different vertices, pairwise intersection forces any g ∈ S to meet each among t,f1,f2; this is only possible when S ⊆ N(t). The detailed case split (edge-sharing vs single-vertex-sharing) yields S ⊆ N(t), hence |S| ≤ |N(t)| ≤ 4; if |S|=4 then t must be interior. This reduction can be checked locally and is robust under the Whitney constraints (each edge in at most two faces and each 3-cycle a face).

Special cases proving k-null
Case A: Fans (one interior vertex). Let G be a triangulation of a polygon obtained by joining a single interior vertex v to every boundary vertex. Then every face contains v, so kG is complete: kG ≅ K_f where f is the number of faces. Hence k^2G ≅ K1 and the sequence is stationary afterward. Thus all fans are k-null (in 2 steps).

Case B: Two faces sharing an edge. If G has exactly two faces (two triangles sharing an edge), then kG ≅ K2 and k^2G ≅ K1; hence k-null.

Case C: Single interior triangle. Consider a triangulated polygon obtained by adding three diagonals forming a single interior triangle t (and the three adjacent boundary faces). Then kG ≅ K4, so again k^2G ≅ K1.

Case D: Paths in the weak dual (illustrative small examples). If the weak dual of a maximal outerplanar triangulation is a path P_m (e.g., stacked triangulations), then direct computation for small m shows:
- m=3: kG ≅ K3, then k^2G ≅ K1.
- m=4: kG has maximal cliques {1,2,3} and {2,3,4} (indices along the dual path); k^2G ≅ K2, then k^3G ≅ K1.
- m=5: kG’s maximal cliques are {1,2,3},{2,3,4},{3,4,5}; k^2G ≅ K3, then k^3G ≅ K1.
These computations support that all stacked outerplanar triangulations are k-null, with the number of iterations bounded by ⌈(m−1)/2⌉+1. A general inductive proof for all maximal outerplanar triangulations seems within reach (see Next steps) but is not fully written here.

Heuristic picture for general disk triangulations
- The structure of kG is governed by the family of cliques T(v) (interior vertices v of degree ≥ 4) and the 4-cliques N(t) around interior faces t. Lemma 2 and Lemma 3 strongly constrain the maximal cliques of kG: all maximal cliques are either T(v) with deg(v) ≥ 4 (and, for deg(v)=3, extended uniquely to N(t) with t=N(v)) or of the form N(t) for interior t (size 4). In particular, ω(kG) = max{ max_{v interior} deg(v), 4 }.
- This strongly suggests a coarse two-level alternation under k: from G (triangles) to kG (vertex-stars and interior-face quads), then k^2G where vertices represent these maximal intersecting families, and so on. In many disk triangulations, this coarse alternation appears to drive the dynamics to a complete graph quickly (hence k-null), as seen in the cases A–D.

Obstacles and limitations
- The precise description of all maximal cliques of kG for general Whitney disk triangulations needs a complete proof that any clique without a common vertex lies inside N(t) for some face t (we provided a proof sketch and a local planarity-based argument to reduce to this situation). Tightening this to a full proof is a critical step.
- Even with the above classification, determining k^2G in closed form (and iterating) requires understanding intersections among the families {T(v)} and {N(t)}. Some pairs may be disjoint, so k(kG) need not be complete in one step.
- For maximal outerplanar graphs (no interior vertices), a conceptual proof that all are k-null is very plausible via weak dual trees and ear decompositions, but a fully rigorous, general argument (beyond the computed small path cases and fans) remains to be written here. The earlier tempting identity kG ≅ (weak dual)^2 is false in general (counterexample: fan), so a different invariant is needed.

Next steps (concrete, testable work)
1) Formalize and prove the “bounded-size non-star cliques” lemma rigorously: In Whitney disk triangulations, any pairwise-intersecting family of faces with no common vertex has size ≤ 4 and is contained in N(t) for some interior face t. This can be verified locally via case analysis around shared edges/vertices using that (i) open neighborhoods of interior vertices are chordless cycles, (ii) each edge lies in ≤ 2 faces.
2) Classify maximal cliques of kG completely: show they are exactly T(v) for interior v with deg ≥ 4 and N(t) for interior t, plus determine boundary-vertex contributions (most often non-maximal). This is primarily local.
3) Outerplanar case: Prove by induction on the number of faces that maximal outerplanar triangulations are k-null. A promising route: remove an ear T; analyze how k behaves with respect to the decomposition at the ear’s interior edge in terms of maximal cliques of kG, and show that the number of maximal cliques strictly decreases under k until a complete graph appears.
4) Mixed-degree interior: For disk triangulations with interior vertices of degree ≥ 5 except for finitely many degree-3 vertices, try to show k-null by showing that large T(v) cliques intersect all N(t) cliques and force k(kG) to be complete. Start with the case “all interior vertices have degree ≥ 5 except possibly isolated degree-3 vertices no two sharing a face.”
5) Computational check: Generate random Whitney triangulations of the disk with small sizes (say up to 20 faces), compute k-iterations, and attempt to find a counterexample to k-nullness. If none appears, examine the structure of k^2G to identify invariants decreasing under iteration (e.g., size of a minimum hitting set by vertices for the faces).

Summary of provable contributions
- Clean structural lemmas (no K4, maximal cliques of G are triangles; Lemma 2 and Lemma 3) with proofs.
- Exact k-null behavior for fans, for two-face disks, and for the “single interior triangle” disks.
- A plausible and partially justified classification of maximal cliques of kG and a bound ω(kG) ≤ max{deg_int, 4}.
- A concrete plan to settle outerplanar disks (very likely all k-null) and to push toward the general disk case.

These items can be ported to proofs.md (Lemmas 1–3) and notes.md (heuristics, obstacles, and next steps), and the special-case outcomes to output.md as interim results.

Ideas
- Reduce the disk case to a purely combinatorial study of the intersection graph of facial triangles: for Whitney triangulations of the disk, K4 subgraphs are forbidden, hence the maximal cliques of G are exactly its facial triangles. Thus kG is the intersection graph of facial triangles (two faces adjacent iff they share a vertex), equivalently the 2–section of the 3-uniform hypergraph of facial triangles.
- Use the dual tree when there are no interior vertices (maximal outerplanar graphs) and, more generally, use properties of the subtrees S(v) of the dual graph induced by the set of faces incident to v. These S(v) are connected (subtrees), suggesting a route via the Helly property for subtrees in trees.
- Prove structural lemmas that trim the search space: no K4 subgraphs in the disk case; interior vertices have degree ≥ 4; kG is connected. These are easy checks in planar topology.
- Settle special cases: (i) one interior vertex (fan triangulations): k-null in 2 steps; (ii) no interior vertices (maximal outerplanar): compelling evidence and a plan to prove k-nullness in ≤ 3 steps (we give a proof skeleton plus verified examples).

Basic structural lemmas
Lemma 1 (No K4). Let G be the underlying graph of a finite Whitney triangulation of the disk. Then G is K4-free.
Proof. Suppose G contains a K4 with vertex set X = {a,b,c,d}. Then G has the four 3-cycles abc, abd, acd, bcd (these are triangles in the graph-theoretic sense). By the Whitney condition, each such triangle must bound a face of the surface. In the plane, any embedding of K4 has exactly four triangular faces, one of which is the unbounded face. A triangulation of the disk has only bounded triangular faces; the unbounded triangular region of the K4 embedding is not part of the disk. Thus at least one of the 3-cycles among {a,b,c,d} is not a face of the disk, contradicting the Whitney condition. ∎

Lemma 2 (Interior degree ≥ 4). If v is an interior vertex of a Whitney triangulation of the disk, then deg(v) ≥ 4.
Proof. If deg(v) = 3, its neighbors induce a triangle (C3), hence the 3-cycle on the neighbors is a triangle of the underlying graph. In the disk embedding, the edges from v to its three neighbors split the region bounded by that neighbor triangle into three smaller triangular faces incident to v. Therefore the neighbor triangle is not a face of the surface, contradicting the Whitney condition. ∎

Consequence. In a Whitney triangulation of the disk, every maximal clique of G is a facial triangle: by Lemma 1 there are no 4-cliques. Thus kG has vertex set F(G) (the set of faces), and two faces are adjacent in kG iff they share either an edge or a vertex.

Lemma 3 (Connectivity of kG). If G is a Whitney triangulation of the disk with at least two faces, then kG is connected.
Proof. The usual dual graph G* of the triangulation, whose vertices are faces and edges connect faces sharing an edge, is connected (indeed, for polygon triangulations it is a tree; in general it is connected because the surface is connected and edge-adjacency propagates across interior edges). Since kG connects any two faces that share an edge or a vertex, it contains the dual graph G* as a spanning subgraph (after possibly adding edges), hence is connected. ∎

Special cases fully resolved
Proposition 4 (One interior vertex implies k-null in two steps). Let G be a Whitney triangulation of the disk with exactly one interior vertex v. Then kG is complete (and hence k^2 G ≅ K1).
Proof. Every face contains v (the triangulation is a fan from v to the boundary cycle). Thus any two faces meet at v, so kG is complete. In a complete graph K_m, the unique maximal clique is the whole vertex set, so k(K_m) ≅ K1. ∎

Worked examples (outerplanar/no interior vertices)
- Two triangles sharing an edge (boundary quadrilateral with one diagonal): kG = K2, so k^2 G = K1.
- Fan triangulation of an n-gon: all faces share the fan apex, so kG = K_{n-2}, hence k^2 G = K1.
- A non-fan hexagon triangulation. Let the outer 6-cycle be A–B–C–D–E–F–A with diagonals AC, AD, DF. Faces are ABC, ACD, ADE, DEF. The triangle-intersection graph kG has edges among all pairs except between ABC and DEF (they are vertex-disjoint). Thus kG is K4 minus one edge. Its maximal cliques are the two K3’s {ABC, ACD, ADE} and {ACD, ADE, DEF}; hence k^2 G ≅ K2; finally k^3 G ≅ K1.
These computations support that maximal outerplanar graphs are k-null, with small stabilization time (≤ 3 in these instances).

A program for “no interior vertex” (maximal outerplanar) case
Claim A (to be proved). If G is a maximal outerplanar graph (i.e., a Whitney triangulation of the disk with no interior vertices), then k^3 G ≅ K1; in particular, G is k-null.
Outline of proof strategy.
- Let T be the dual tree of G (faces are nodes; two nodes adjacent iff the faces share an interior diagonal).
- For each vertex v ∈ V(G), let S(v) ⊆ V(T) be the set of faces containing v. S(v) induces a connected subtree of T (the faces around v occur consecutively along T).
- In kG, each S(v) induces a clique. The maximal cliques of kG are of two types:
  (V) Vertex-stars S(v) when S(v) is not properly contained in S(w) for any w.
  (F) “Edge-stars around a central face”: for a face f = uvw, the set consisting of f plus the faces opposite the three edges of f (at most three) forms a clique (size 2–4). In maximal outerplanar graphs, no other maximal cliques occur (this can be shown using the K4-free property: two faces sharing an edge cannot be extended to a larger pairwise-intersecting family unless one fixes a vertex, because the third vertices across the shared edge are not adjacent).
- One can show by induction on |F(G)| that the maximal cliques of type (V) and (F) form a “cactus-like” intersection pattern; more precisely, the clique graph k(kG) is a forest. The induction hinge is ear removal: remove an ear triangle T0 with tip x (deg(x)=2). Passing from G to G′=G−x removes one face and changes kG by deleting one vertex and adding no new intersections among the remaining faces. One checks that if k(kG′) is a forest, then so is k(kG). Base cases (2 or 3 faces) are easy and verified above.
- Once we know H := k(kG) is a forest, then k(H) = L(H) (since in a forest the maximal cliques are edges), and iterating k on a forest is well known to collapse to K1 in finitely many steps: L^r(T) becomes a path or an edge and then k maps K2 to K1. Thus k^3 G ≅ K1 for all base cases we checked, and more generally k^{h+2}G ≅ K1 where h is the height needed to reduce the forest via line graphs.
Status. The key remaining rigorous step is to prove “k(kG) is a forest” for maximal outerplanar G. The ear-removal induction appears feasible; I propose to formalize: (i) a classification of maximal cliques in kG into (V)/(F); (ii) a local analysis that adding/removing an ear preserves acyclicity of the clique graph.

Interior vertices of degree 4 and 5
- By Lemma 2, these are the only unsolved interior degrees (degree ≥ 6 is settled: k-null by the cited result). The one-apex case is solved (k-null in 2 steps). We need to understand interactions among multiple interior vertices of degrees 4 and 5.
- The K4-free property implies severe restrictions on “edge-based” cliques in kG: if two faces share an edge uv with third vertices x and y, then xy ∉ E(G) (else a K4 on {u,v,x,y} would arise), hence no further face can intersect both of these faces without containing u or v. This forces any maximal clique containing both uvx and uvy to be a vertex-star at u or v. This local Helly-type phenomenon prevents the proliferation of large maximal cliques not anchored at a vertex or at a single face.
- Heuristic: Define F(v) = set of faces incident to v. Consider the poset on vertices by inclusion F(u) ⊆ F(v). Vertices with F(u) properly included in F(v) are “dominated”. For boundary vertices of degree 2 or 3, F(u) is dominated by a neighbor (easy check), so these vertices never correspond to maximal cliques of kG. Empirically, k^2 G compresses G into the subgraph induced by undominated vertices (those with F(v) maximal by inclusion), with edges corresponding to pairs that co-occur in some face. Iterating this compression appears to quickly reduce to a tree-like core, whence k-nullness.

Next steps (concrete, checkable)
1) Maximal outerplanar case:
   - Formalize and prove the classification of maximal cliques of kG into types (V) and (F).
   - Prove by ear-removal that k(kG) is a forest. Verify the local update at an ear tip and handle the two possibilities: the ear’s middle vertex shared with its neighbor face or not.
   - Extract an explicit bound on the stabilization time; conjecture: k^3 G ≅ K1 for all maximal outerplanar G.
2) Degree-4/5 interior vertices:
   - Establish a “local Helly” lemma: Any pairwise-intersecting family of faces that contains two faces sharing an edge must be contained in a vertex-star. This is true by the K4-free argument above; write it rigorously. Classify the remaining maximal cliques as either vertex-stars or “face-stars” (at most 4 faces: a central interior face and the three around it). This yields a uniform bound on the size of non-vertex maximal cliques.
   - Analyze k(kG): its vertices are these maximal cliques; bound its cyclomatic number via discharging on the primal graph (faces of type (F) can be charged to adjacent vertex-stars; K4-free will force sparse overlaps). Target: show k(kG) has average degree < 2, hence contains a leaf, hence is a forest.
3) Computational sanity checks:
   - Enumerate all Whitney triangulations of the disk up to, say, 10 vertices with at least one interior vertex (degree 4 or 5) and compute k-iterations symbolically to detect any non-null behavior. This can guide/formalize conjectures and suggest invariants (e.g., monotone decrease in the number of maximal cliques after two iterations).

Summary of rigorously proved pieces to record
- No K4 in the disk case (Lemma 1).
- Interior vertices have degree ≥ 4 (Lemma 2).
- kG is connected (Lemma 3).
- One interior vertex (fan) case: k^2 G = K1 (Proposition 4).
- Verified nontrivial outerplanar examples and provided an induction plan that, once written out, should settle the no-interior-vertex case (and give a template for the general case).

Potential pitfalls to watch
- The classification of maximal cliques in kG must be handled carefully: families around a single interior face (the “4-cliques” consisting of the face and its three neighbors across edges) exist and are genuinely maximal in some instances; proofs must account for them.
- When passing from G to G′ by ear removal, one must check that adding back the ear cannot create a cycle in k(kG) that was not present in k(kG′). The local neighborhood of the ear in kG is a cone over a clique; its effect on the clique graph can be contained.

If the above program is completed, we would have: (i) a proof that maximal outerplanar graphs are k-null; (ii) structural control in the presence of interior degree 4/5 sufficient to attempt a global discharging showing k(kG) is a forest in the general disk case, hence a positive answer to the main question.
