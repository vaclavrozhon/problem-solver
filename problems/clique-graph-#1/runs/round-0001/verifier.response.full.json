Prover 1\u2019s argument (a K4 would form a closed 2-manifold component with no boundary) is sound. Prover 2\u2019s proof invoking the unbounded face is not robust for a disk; please switch to the \u201cclosed component\u201d argument.\\n- In the disk case, every maximal clique of the primal graph is a facial triangle (since K4 is forbidden and every 3-cycle is a face). Hence kG is the intersection graph of the facial triangles (two faces adjacent iff they share a vertex). This should go to proofs.md.\\n- The link of an interior vertex is a chordless cycle. From this, interior degree \u2265 4 follows (deg 3 would force the neighbor triangle to be a face, contradicting that the three v-incident faces already subdivide its interior). Prover 2\u2019s statement is right; please ground it in the link-of-v lemma.\\n- For an interior vertex v with deg(v) \u2265 4, T(v) is a clique and is maximal in kG. A clean proof uses: (i) the link cycle has no chords; (ii) any face f not containing v can include at most two consecutive neighbors of v, so it meets at most three consecutive faces in T(v); for deg \u2265 4 some face in T(v) is missed.\\n- For an interior face t whose three edges are interior, N(t) (t plus its three edge-neighbors) induces a K4 in kG and is maximal; the \u201cthird vertex\u201d argument excluding further faces is sound.\\n- Special k-null classes are correct: fans (one interior vertex), two-face disks, and the \u201chexagon with a central interior triangle.\u201d These can be cleanly proved.\\n\\nWhat needs fixing or remains unproven\\n- Prover 1: the deg(v)=3 case in Lemma 2 is irrelevant in the disk (interior deg \u2265 4); please remove or explicitly restrict the statement to general surfaces.

So weaken it to: any face intersecting both of two faces that share an edge must contain one of the edge\u2019s endpoints; this still helps.\\n- Outerplanar case: the program to prove k(kG) is a forest is promising but unproven; also, even if H is a forest, iterating k does not trivially collapse in \u22643 steps without a careful analysis (since k(H)=L(H), which may have triangles).

Let G be the underlying graph of a finite Whitney triangulation of the disk: an embedding on the closed disk in which every 3-cycle of G bounds a facial triangle, each edge is incident with one or two faces (boundary or interior edge, respectively), and the union of the faces is a topological disk.\\n\\nLemma 1 (K4-free). The graph G contains no K4 as a subgraph.\\nProof. Suppose a K4 with vertex set X={a,b,c,d} occurs. By the Whitney condition, each 3-cycle in X bounds a face, so the four triangles abc, abd, acd, bcd are faces of the triangulation. Every edge of the K4 lies in exactly two of these four triangular faces, hence none of these edges is a boundary edge, and no additional face can be incident with them. Therefore the subcomplex formed by these four faces has empty boundary: it is a closed 2-dimensional component (indeed, the boundary of a tetrahedron). This cannot occur in a triangulation of a disk, whose 2-complex has exactly one component with nonempty boundary and no closed components. Contradiction. \u220e\\n\\nCorollary 2. The maximal cliques of G are exactly its facial triangles.\\nProof. By Lemma 1, G has no K4. Any 3-clique is a 3-cycle and hence a facial triangle by the Whitney condition. No edge or single vertex is maximal. \u220e\\n\\nLemma 3 (Link of an interior vertex). If v is an interior vertex of G with neighbors N(v) listed in cyclic order around v as w_1,\\\\dots,w_d, then for each i the edge w_iw_{i+1} exists and bounds the face (v,w_i,w_{i+1}), and there is no edge w_iw_j for nonconsecutive indices i\\\\notin\\\\{j\\\\pm1\\\\}.\\nProof. Each face incident to v is a triangle and uses two consecutive neighbors of v; thus each consecutive pair bounds a face and is an edge. If some nonconsecutive pair w_i,w_j were adjacent, then (v,w_i,w_j) would be a 3-cycle and hence a face by the Whitney condition. This face would overlap the existing fan of faces around v, contradicting that faces form a 2-manifold (the local link at v must be a simple cycle). Hence no such chord exists. \u220e\\n\\nCorollary 4 (Interior degree bound). If v is an interior vertex then deg(v) \u2265 4.\\nProof. If deg(v)=3, Lemma 3 implies the neighbors form a triangle w_1w_2w_3, which is a 3-cycle. By Whitney, it must be a face. But the three faces (v,w_1,w_2), (v,w_2,w_3), (v,w_3,w_1) already partition the region bounded by w_1w_2w_3, so w_1w_2w_3 cannot be a face. Contradiction. \u220e\\n\\nProposition 5 (Vertex-stars are maximal cliques in kG). Let v be an interior vertex with deg(v)=d\u22654, and let T(v) be the set of faces incident to v. Then T(v) induces a clique in kG and is maximal.\\nProof. Any two faces in T(v) meet at v, so T(v) is a clique. Let f be a face not containing v. By Lemma 3, f contains at most two vertices from N(v), and if it contains two, they must be consecutive along the link cycle. If f contains exactly one neighbor w_i of v, then f intersects only the two faces (v,w_{i-1},w_i) and (v,w_i,w_{i+1}) in T(v). If f contains two consecutive neighbors w_i,w_{i+1}, then f intersects at most the three faces (v,w_{i-1},w_i), (v,w_i,w_{i+1}), (v,w_{i+1},w_{i+2}) in T(v). In all cases, since d\u22654, there exists a face in T(v) disjoint from f. Hence no face outside T(v) is adjacent (in kG) to all of T(v), proving maximality. \u220e\\n\\nProposition 6 (Interior-face 4-cliques). Let t be an interior face whose three edges are interior. Let N(t) be the set consisting of t and the unique face across each edge of t. Then N(t) has size 4 and induces a K4 in kG, and it is a maximal clique of kG.\\nProof. Each of the three neighbors of t shares an edge with t, hence is adjacent to t in kG. Two distinct neighbors of t share exactly one vertex (the corresponding vertex of t), so they are adjacent. Thus N(t) induces K4. For maximality, let f be any face not in N(t). If f meets all three neighbors of t, then, since any two of those neighbors intersect only in a vertex of t, f must contain at least two vertices of t. But any face containing two vertices of t must use an edge of t, and each edge of t already has exactly two incident faces (t and its opposite neighbor), so no such f exists. Therefore N(t) is maximal. \u220e\\n\\nLemma 7 (Connectivity of kG). If G has at least two faces, then kG is connected.\\nProof. The dual graph whose vertices are faces of G and edges join faces that share an edge is connected (the 2-complex is a disk). Since kG contains this dual graph as a spanning subgraph (it has at least those adjacencies, and possibly more when faces meet at a vertex), kG is connected. \u220e\\n\\nSpecial k-null cases.\\nProposition 8 (Fans). If G has exactly one interior vertex v (a fan triangulation), then kG is complete, hence k^2G\u2245K1.\\nProof. Every face contains v, so any two faces intersect. The clique graph of a complete graph is K1. \u220e\\n\\nProposition 9 (Two faces). If G consists of two triangles sharing an interior edge, then kG\u2245K2 and k^2G\u2245K1. \u220e\\n\\nProposition 10 (Central interior triangle in a hexagon). Consider a maximal outerplanar triangulation obtained from a 6-cycle A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D\u2013E\u2013F\u2013A by adding chords AC, CE, EA. The faces are ABC, CDE, EFA, and ACE, and every pair of faces intersects. Hence kG\u2245K4 and k^2G\u2245K1. \u220e\\n\"},\"output_update\":null}",
