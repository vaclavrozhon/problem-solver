We verified core structural facts for Whitney disk triangulations: (i) the primal graph is K4-free; (ii) maximal cliques of the primal are exactly the facial triangles, so kG is the vertex-intersection graph of faces; (iii) the link of an interior vertex is a chordless cycle, implying interior degree ≥ 4; (iv) for interior v, T(v) is a maximal clique in kG; (v) for an interior face with all edges interior, N(t) induces a maximal K4 in kG. We also rigorously settled several k-null families: fans (one interior vertex), two-face disks, and the “hexagon with a central interior triangle” case. Two major gaps remain: a complete classification of maximal cliques of kG (reducing any non-star clique to N(t)), and a rigorous proof for the outerplanar case (ear-removal and showing k(kG) is a forest). Verdict: uncertain progress; more proofs needed before promoting results.
