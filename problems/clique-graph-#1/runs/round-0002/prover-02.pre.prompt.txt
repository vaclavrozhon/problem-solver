You are a research mathematician. 

You are being run in a loop with a verifier that checks rigor. Your goal is to make **incremental, auditable progress**. You are not expected to solve the problem at once, but to generate new, testable ideas.

Inputs: 
- task statement 
- notes.md (informal progress & exploratory work; optional) 
- proofs.md (rigorously proven results & detailed proofs; optional) 
- output.md (main results, rigorously presented; optional) 
- summary of past rounds (optional) 
- possibly some reference papers.

What counts as progress:
- Extract lemmas/heuristics from literature. Generalize them for current task, or explain why they could be helpful. 
- Explore small examples & try to break your own claims with toy counterexamples.
- Prove special cases or nontrivial bounds.
- If an approach fails, explain crisply why.
- Point out flaws in notes.md, proofs.md, or output.md (you are not rewriting these files yourself, that's verifier's job).

**Discipline.** 
- Read notes, outputs, summaries carefully before proposing new work. 
- Reference papers if relevant, but focus on *incremental, checkable steps*. 
- Do not output Markdown code fences, only raw JSON. 
- Length: at least ~200 words. 
- Organize your reasoning with short headings (Ideas, Examples, Obstacles, Next steps), make clear what your claims are and how they are supported. 

**Output**: Write your analysis as Markdown that includes both informal reasoning and any rigorous proofs. The verifier will decide what goes into notes.md, proofs.md, and output.md.

Problem 7. Clique Dynamics of Whitney triangulations
(suggested by Anna Margarethe Limbach)
Source: Proposed by F. Larrión, V. Neumann-Lara, and M. A.
Pizaña in 2002 [4].
Definitions.
• Given a graph G, its clique graph kG is the intersection graph
of its maximal complete subgraphs, called cliques. This means the
set of cliques of G is the vertex set of kG, and two vertices of kG
are adjacent if and only if they intersect non-trivially as cliques.
The operator k that maps each graph to its clique graph is called the
clique graph operator, and one can apply it iteratively to generate
the sequence of iterated clique graphs k
0G = G, k
1G = kG, k
2G =
k(kG), k
3G, . . ..
• If the sequence of iterated clique graphs of a graph G consists of
pairwise non-isomorphic graphs, G is called k-divergent, otherwise,
k-convergent, and if it contains the graph that consists of a singleton
(and then becomes stationary there) G is called k-null.
• A graph is called locally cyclic, if each open neighbourhood of a
vertex induces a cycle.
• A Whitney-triangulation of a compact surface is a triangulation
such that each triangle of its underlying graph is a face of the
surface. Whitney triangulations of closed surfaces are locally cyclic
with minimum degree ≥ 3 and the only one with minimum degree 3
is the K4 that triangulates the sphere.
From another perspective one can start with such a locally cyclic
graph and obtain a closed surface by “filling in the triangles”.

Question
Is the underlying graph of a finite Whitney triangulation of
the disk always k-null?

Related results:
• The K4 is k-null.
• The octahedron graph is k-divergent.
• The icosahedron graph is k-divergent.
• All locally cyclic graphs with minimum degree ≥ 7 are k-convergent.
• Every closed surface admits a k-divergent Whitney triangulation.
• Every closed surface with negative Euler characteristic admits a
k-convergent Whitney triangulation.
• Every Whitney triangulation of the disk such that every interior
vertex has degree ≥ 6 is k-null.

# Research Notes



Structural facts we will use for Whitney triangulations of the disk
- The underlying graph G is K4-free. Otherwise the four 3-cycles of a K4 would all be faces, every edge of that K4 would be incident with two faces within the K4, yielding a closed 2D component incompatible with a disk with boundary.
- Every maximal clique of G is a facial triangle: Whitney implies every 3-cycle is a face, and K4-free prohibits larger cliques.
- The link of an interior vertex v is a chordless cycle on N(v): the faces around v are exactly the triangles (v, w_i, w_{i+1}) in cyclic order; any chord among nonconsecutive neighbors would create a 3-cycle (v, w_i, w_j) that cannot be realized as a face without breaking the manifold structure.
- In particular, interior vertices have degree ≥ 4 (deg 3 would force the neighbor triangle to be a face, contradicting that it is subdivided by the three v-incident faces).
- For an interior vertex v with deg(v) ≥ 4, the set T(v) of faces incident to v is a clique in kG and is maximal: a face f not containing v can include at most two consecutive neighbors of v, hence meets at most three consecutive faces in T(v); for deg(v) ≥ 4 there exists a face of T(v) disjoint from f.
- For an interior face t with all three edges interior, N(t) (t together with the faces across its three edges) induces a K4 in kG and is a maximal clique.

Special k-null families verified
- Fans (exactly one interior vertex): all faces meet at the apex, so kG is complete; hence k^2G ≅ K1.
- Two-face disk (two triangles sharing one interior edge): kG ≅ K2 and k^2G ≅ K1.
- Hexagon with a central interior triangle (outerplanar triangulation with three chords forming a central triangle): exactly four faces; all pairs intersect, so kG ≅ K4 and k^2G ≅ K1.

Open targets and plan
- Classify maximal cliques of kG: Conjecture that every non-star maximal clique is N(t) for some interior face t. Needed: a rigorous reduction showing any pairwise-intersecting family of faces with no common vertex has size ≤ 4 and is contained in N(t).
- Outerplanar case (no interior vertices): pursue ear-removal induction. Track how maximal cliques of kG change and prove that k(kG) remains acyclic (or otherwise identify a monotone invariant). Verify carefully that adding/removing an ear does not create cycles in the clique graph.
- Computation: exhaustively generate small disk Whitney triangulations to test k-iterations and search for counterexamples to k-nullness in low-degree interior regimes (4 and 5).

# Main Results




=== Round 1 Summary ===

This round established core structural lemmas for finite Whitney triangulations of the disk and proved several small k-null cases. Main verified facts: G is K4-free, so maximal cliques of the primal are exactly the facial triangles; the link of any interior vertex is a chordless cycle, forcing interior degree ≥4; for an interior vertex v the incident-face set T(v) is a maximal clique in kG; any interior face t with all three edges interior yields N(t) (t plus the three adjacent faces) which induces a maximal K4 in kG; and kG is connected when G has ≥2 faces. k-nullness was proved for fans (one interior vertex), the two-triangle disk, and the hexagon-with-central-triangle (k^2G ≅ K1). Remaining major gaps are a full classification of maximal cliques of kG (conjecture: every non-star maximal clique is some N(t)) and a completed ear-removal induction for the outerplanar case.

=== Previous Round Feedback ===

Overall both provers made useful structural progress, but several claims need correction or fuller proofs.

What looks correct and ready to formalize
- K4 cannot occur in the underlying graph of a Whitney triangulation of the disk. Prover 1’s argument (a K4 would form a closed 2-manifold component with no boundary) is sound. Prover 2’s proof invoking the unbounded face is not robust for a disk; please switch to the “closed component” argument.
- In the disk case, every maximal clique of the primal graph is a facial triangle (since K4 is forbidden and every 3-cycle is a face). Hence kG is the intersection graph of the facial triangles (two faces adjacent iff they share a vertex). This should go to proofs.md.
- The link of an interior vertex is a chordless cycle. From this, interior degree ≥ 4 follows (deg 3 would force the neighbor triangle to be a face, contradicting that the three v-incident faces already subdivide its interior). Prover 2’s statement is right; please ground it in the link-of-v lemma.
- For an interior vertex v with deg(v) ≥ 4, T(v) is a clique and is maximal in kG. A clean proof uses: (i) the link cycle has no chords; (ii) any face f not containing v can include at most two consecutive neighbors of v, so it meets at most three consecutive faces in T(v); for deg ≥ 4 some face in T(v) is missed.
- For an interior face t whose three edges are interior, N(t) (t plus its three edge-neighbors) induces a K4 in kG and is maximal; the “third vertex” argument excluding further faces is sound.
- Special k-null classes are correct: fans (one interior vertex), two-face disks, and the “hexagon with a central interior triangle.” These can be cleanly proved.

What needs fixing or remains unproven
- Prover 1: the deg(v)=3 case in Lemma 2 is irrelevant in the disk (interior deg ≥ 4); please remove or explicitly restrict the statement to general surfaces. The “bounded non-star cliques” classification is only sketched; do not claim ω(kG)=max{max_deg_int,4} without a full proof. Provide a rigorous reduction proving any clique with no common vertex is contained in N(t) for some interior face t.
- Prover 2: the “local Helly” claim “two faces sharing an edge force the maximal clique to be a vertex-star” is false (counterexample: N(t) as in Lemma 3). So weaken it to: any face intersecting both of two faces that share an edge must contain one of the edge’s endpoints; this still helps.
- Outerplanar case: the program to prove k(kG) is a forest is promising but unproven; also, even if H is a forest, iterating k does not trivially collapse in ≤3 steps without a careful analysis (since k(H)=L(H), which may have triangles). Please formalize the ear-removal step and acyclicity preservation.

Next steps
1) Write full proofs for: link-of-v as a chordless cycle; T(v) maximal for interior v; N(t) maximal K4. 2) Prove the “non-star cliques” classification or produce a minimal counterexample. 3) Outerplanar case: complete the ear-removal induction and precisely track how maximal cliques of kG change. 4) Run exhaustive checks up to moderate size to guide conjectures and find any counterexamples to k-nullness.
