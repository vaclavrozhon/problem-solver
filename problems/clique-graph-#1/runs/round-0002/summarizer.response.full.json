          "text": "{\"summary_md\":\"This round established core local structure for finite Whitney triangulations of the disk and advanced the classification of maximal cliques in kG when an interior edge is shared. Proven: G is K4-free so maximal cliques of the primal are exactly facial triangles; the link of any interior vertex is a chordless cycle, hence interior degree \u22654; for interior v the incident-face set T(v) is a maximal clique in kG; any interior face with all three edges interior yields N(t) that induces a maximal K4 in kG; kG is connected for graphs with \u22652 faces. New structural lemmas: a local Helly lemma across an interior edge, and Proposition 13 classifying any maximal clique containing two faces that share an interior edge (it is T(u), T(v), N(t) or N(g)). Verified k-nullness for fans, the two-face disk, and the hexagon-with-central-triangle. Remaining major gap: classification of maximal cliques with no edge-sharing pair and a completed outerplanar ear-removal proof.
