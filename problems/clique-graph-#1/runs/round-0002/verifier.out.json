The intended conclusion (S=N(t) under a two-edge configuration) is plausible but needs a corrected argument. \n- Prover 2\u2019s Proposition 9 is on the right track but the proof needs a precise \u201canchor\u201d argument: in the mixed case (both u- and v-faces present), every cross-pair must share w or x; this forces all u-faces to contain the same anchor (say w) and all v-faces the same anchor (also w), yielding C \u2286 {t,g,f_{uw},f_{vw}}, hence C=N(t) by maximality. Also correct the slip \u201cN(g)=N(t)\u201d: they are generally different; the conclusion should be \u201cC=N(t) or C=N(g)\u201d. \n- Full classification remains incomplete: cliques with no pair of faces sharing an edge have not been settled (a Helly-type statement is still conjectural).\n\nNext steps (concrete)\n1) Repair and formalize the \u201ctwo-edge trigger\u201d classification with the anchor proof (we appended a clean version to proofs.md). 2) Tackle the no-edge-sharing cliques: attempt a minimal-counterexample analysis around a face t of minimal boundary-edge count; or prove a Helly-type property for facial triangles in disk Whitney triangulations. 3) Outerplanar case: write the ear-removal induction carefully; track maximal cliques of kG via contiguous blocks S(v) in the dual tree; aim to show k(kG) is a forest. 4) Computational sweep for small instances (outerplanar and with interior degree 4/5) to test the conjectured classification and k-nullness bounds.",

Otherwise it would have to contain both w and x, forcing the edge wx and thus a K4 on {u,v,w,x}, contradicting K4-freeness.\n- Shared-edge classification (partial): Let C be a maximal clique in kG that contains two faces t=uvw and g=uvx sharing the interior edge uv. Partition C into A (faces containing u but not v) and B (faces containing v but not u). If B=\u2205, then C=T(u); if A=\u2205, then C=T(v). If both A and B are nonempty, then every a\u2208A and b\u2208B must share a common vertex in {w,x} (the only common neighbors of u and v). This forces all faces in A and B to contain the same anchor (say w), whence A\u2286{f_{uw}} and B\u2286{f_{vw}}, so C\u2286{t,g,f_{uw},f_{vw}} and maximality yields C={t,g,f_{uw},f_{vw}}=N(t). Symmetrically, if the common anchor is x then C=N(g).\n- Caution: Non-star cliques without any edge-sharing pair remain unclassified. A plausible Helly-type statement is that any pairwise-intersecting family of facial triangles with no two sharing an edge has a common vertex; proving this would complete the classification.\n\nProgram milestones\n- Complete the above shared-edge classification (done; see proofs.md) and then settle the no-edge-sharing case via a minimal-counterexample analysis around a face with minimal number of boundary edges.\n- Outerplanar (no interior vertices): model faces as nodes of the dual tree; for each boundary vertex v, the incident faces form a contiguous path S(v). Conjecture: maximal cliques of kG are exactly T(v) with S(v) inclusion-maximal. Aim to show k(kG) is a forest via ear-removal, yielding k-nullness.\n- Continue small-instance computations for guidance (particularly with interior degrees 4 and 5)."

    "content": "Lemma 11 (Local Helly across an interior edge). Let uv be an interior edge with incident faces t=uvw and g=uvx (w\\neq x). If a face f intersects both t and g, then f contains u or v.\nProof. Suppose f contains neither u nor v. Then to meet t and g, f must contain both w and x. Any face containing w and x must include the edge wx. But then the vertices {u,v,w,x} span all six edges uv,uw,vw,ux,vx,wx, yielding a K4, contradicting Lemma 1. \u220e\n\nLemma 12 (Common neighbors of an interior edge). With notation as above, N(u)\\cap N(v)=\\{w,x\\}.\nProof. Any common neighbor y of u and v forms the 3-cycle uvy, which must be a face by the Whitney property. Since uv is interior, it has exactly two incident faces, namely t and g. Hence y\u2208\\{w,x\\}. \u220e\n\nProposition 13 (Classification when a shared interior edge is present). Let C be a maximal clique of kG that contains two faces t=uvw and g=uvx sharing the interior edge uv. Then either C=T(u), or C=T(v), or C=N(t)={t,g,f_{uw},f_{vw}}, or C=N(g)={g,t,f_{ux},f_{vx}}, where f_{ab} denotes the unique face across interior edge ab when it exists.\nProof. Let A be the set of faces in C that contain u but not v, and B the set of faces that contain v but not u. If B=\\varnothing, then every face in C contains u, so C\u2286T(u), and maximality forces C=T(u). Symmetrically, if A=\\varnothing then C=T(v). Assume A,B\u2260\\varnothing. For any a\u2208A and b\u2208B, a and b cannot share u or v, so they must share a common neighbor of u and v. By Lemma 12, the only possibilities are w or x. Thus for every a\u2208A and b\u2208B we have (w\u2208a\u2229b) or (x\u2208a\u2229b).\nClaim: All faces in A contain the same anchor in {w,x}, and all faces in B contain the same anchor, and these anchors are equal. Indeed, if some a,a\u2032\u2208A satisfy w\u2208a and x\u2208a\u2032, then any b\u2208B would need to contain both w and x to intersect both a and a\u2032, impossible. Thus all A-faces contain the same anchor; call it y\u2208{w,x}. The same argument shows all B-faces contain the same anchor y\u2032\u2208{w,x}. Since every a\u2208A must meet every b\u2208B, we must have y=y\u2032.\nAssume y=w (the case y=x is symmetric). Any face in A contains u and w but not v; the only such face is f_{uw} (the face opposite uw), so A\u2286{f_{uw}}, and in fact A={f_{uw}}. Similarly, B={f_{vw}}. Therefore C\u2286{t,g,f_{uw},f_{vw}}. All four pairwise intersect, so by maximality C must equal this set, i.e., C=N(t). If y=x, the same reasoning yields C=N(g). \u220e\n"
