=== SYSTEM ===
You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md, proofs.md, and output.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers
- notes.md (informal progress & exploratory work so far)
- proofs.md (rigorous proofs & detailed mathematics so far)
- output.md (main results found so far)

**Three-tier file system guidelines**:
- **notes.md**: Readable, log of exploratory work, intuitions, failed attempts, ideas. Prefer appending. Replace only if old notes are clearly misleading. It should be self-contained: In particular, reading it should make sense without knowing the output of provers in past rounds. 

- **proofs.md**: Complete rigorous mathematical proofs with full details. Think twice before adding anything. Contains proven lemmas, theorems, and detailed derivations. Only add mathematically verified content here.
- **output.md**: This is the only file that the user is supposed to read in case your verdict is "promising". It has to be self-contained. It contains ONLY the main problem results, and a discussion why they are relevant. It is extremely selective. Think twice before promoting proofs from proofs.md to output.md. Only if the result marks clear progress on the problem, and only if the proof in proofs.md has been thoroughly vetted by provers and you, it can join output.md. Each result must be followed by a rigorous, self-contained proof that properly defines all objects of interest and is essentially publication-ready. 

Tasks:
1) Audit rigor: identify unjustified steps, false statements, missing lemmas; produce minimal counterexamples.
2) Triage value: separate genuine progress from noise.
3) Guide next steps: propose what provers should try next.

Problem 7. Clique Dynamics of Whitney triangulations
(suggested by Anna Margarethe Limbach)
Source: Proposed by F. Larrión, V. Neumann-Lara, and M. A.
Pizaña in 2002 [4].
Definitions.
• Given a graph G, its clique graph kG is the intersection graph
of its maximal complete subgraphs, called cliques. This means the
set of cliques of G is the vertex set of kG, and two vertices of kG
are adjacent if and only if they intersect non-trivially as cliques.
The operator k that maps each graph to its clique graph is called the
clique graph operator, and one can apply it iteratively to generate
the sequence of iterated clique graphs k
0G = G, k
1G = kG, k
2G =
k(kG), k
3G, . . ..
• If the sequence of iterated clique graphs of a graph G consists of
pairwise non-isomorphic graphs, G is called k-divergent, otherwise,
k-convergent, and if it contains the graph that consists of a singleton
(and then becomes stationary there) G is called k-null.
• A graph is called locally cyclic, if each open neighbourhood of a
vertex induces a cycle.
• A Whitney-triangulation of a compact surface is a triangulation
such that each triangle of its underlying graph is a face of the
surface. Whitney triangulations of closed surfaces are locally cyclic
with minimum degree ≥ 3 and the only one with minimum degree 3
is the K4 that triangulates the sphere.
From another perspective one can start with such a locally cyclic
graph and obtain a closed surface by “filling in the triangles”.

Question
Is the underlying graph of a finite Whitney triangulation of
the disk always k-null?

Related results:
• The K4 is k-null.
• The octahedron graph is k-divergent.
• The icosahedron graph is k-divergent.
• All locally cyclic graphs with minimum degree ≥ 7 are k-convergent.
• Every closed surface admits a k-divergent Whitney triangulation.
• Every closed surface with negative Euler characteristic admits a
k-convergent Whitney triangulation.
• Every Whitney triangulation of the disk such that every interior
vertex has degree ≥ 6 is k-null.

# Research Notes



Structural facts we will use for Whitney triangulations of the disk
- The underlying graph G is K4-free. Otherwise the four 3-cycles of a K4 would all be faces, every edge of that K4 would be incident with two faces within the K4, yielding a closed 2D component incompatible with a disk with boundary.
- Every maximal clique of G is a facial triangle: Whitney implies every 3-cycle is a face, and K4-free prohibits larger cliques.
- The link of an interior vertex v is a chordless cycle on N(v): the faces around v are exactly the triangles (v, w_i, w_{i+1}) in cyclic order; any chord among nonconsecutive neighbors would create a 3-cycle (v, w_i, w_j) that cannot be realized as a face without breaking the manifold structure.
- In particular, interior vertices have degree ≥ 4 (deg 3 would force the neighbor triangle to be a face, contradicting that it is subdivided by the three v-incident faces).
- For an interior vertex v with deg(v) ≥ 4, the set T(v) of faces incident to v is a clique in kG and is maximal: a face f not containing v can include at most two consecutive neighbors of v, hence meets at most three consecutive faces in T(v); for deg(v) ≥ 4 there exists a face of T(v) disjoint from f.
- For an interior face t with all three edges interior, N(t) (t together with the faces across its three edges) induces a K4 in kG and is a maximal clique.

Special k-null families verified
- Fans (exactly one interior vertex): all faces meet at the apex, so kG is complete; hence k^2G ≅ K1.
- Two-face disk (two triangles sharing one interior edge): kG ≅ K2 and k^2G ≅ K1.
- Hexagon with a central interior triangle (outerplanar triangulation with three chords forming a central triangle): exactly four faces; all pairs intersect, so kG ≅ K4 and k^2G ≅ K1.

Open targets and plan
- Classify maximal cliques of kG: Conjecture that every non-star maximal clique is N(t) for some interior face t. Needed: a rigorous reduction showing any pairwise-intersecting family of faces with no common vertex has size ≤ 4 and is contained in N(t).
- Outerplanar case (no interior vertices): pursue ear-removal induction. Track how maximal cliques of kG change and prove that k(kG) remains acyclic (or otherwise identify a monotone invariant). Verify carefully that adding/removing an ear does not create cycles in the clique graph.
- Computation: exhaustively generate small disk Whitney triangulations to test k-iterations and search for counterexamples to k-nullness in low-degree interior regimes (4 and 5).

Overview
We focus on rigorous, local structure for Whitney triangulations of the disk, and prove three core lemmas requested by the verifier (link-of-v is a cycle; star cliques T(v) are maximal for interior v; N(t) forms a maximal K4 for interior t). We then add a new partial classification lemma for non-star maximal cliques and consequences. Several small k-null families are confirmed, and we outline the next steps to complete the classification of maximal cliques of kG and the outerplanar case.

Rigorous lemmas and proofs
Lemma 1 (K4-free; maximal cliques in G are facial triangles).
Let G be the underlying graph of a finite Whitney triangulation of the disk. Then G contains no K4 subgraph. Consequently, the maximal cliques of G are precisely its facial triangles.
Proof.
If H ≅ K4 were an induced subgraph of G, Whitney implies that each 3-cycle of H bounds a face; thus the four triangular faces on the vertex-set of H appear in the triangulation. Each of the six edges of H is then incident with exactly two of these four faces. Hence none of those edges can lie on the boundary of the disk. Therefore those four faces form a closed 2-dimensional subcomplex (topologically a 2-sphere), disjoint from the boundary. This contradicts that the triangulation of a connected disk has no closed component. Thus K4 is forbidden. Since every 3-cycle bounds a face and K4 is forbidden, no clique of order ≥ 4 exists, and no edge can be maximal as a clique. Therefore the maximal cliques in G are exactly the facial triangles. ∎

Lemma 2 (Link of an interior vertex is a chordless cycle; interior degree ≥ 4).
Let v be an interior vertex of G. Then the induced subgraph on N(v) is a chordless cycle. In particular, deg(v) ≥ 4.
Proof.
Consider the star St(v), i.e., the union of all faces incident with v. In a triangulation of a 2-manifold, St(v) is a closed topological disk and its boundary, the link Lk(v), is a simple cycle whose vertices are N(v), and whose edges are precisely the pairs {x,y} for which vxy is a face. This shows that (i) the edges among N(v) that occur in faces with v form a cycle. Suppose there were a chord xy among N(v) joining nonconsecutive vertices of Lk(v). Then the 3-cycle vxy exists and, by Whitney, bounds a face. But the edge vx would then be incident with the two faces vxp and vxq coming from the two link-adjacent neighbors p,q of x around v, and also with the face vxy, a contradiction to “each edge is incident with exactly two faces.” Hence no such chord exists, so the induced subgraph on N(v) is exactly the link cycle. Finally, if deg(v)=3, then N(v) induces a triangle and the four vertices {v}∪N(v) form a K4 subgraph, contradicting Lemma 1. Hence deg(v) ≥ 4. ∎

Lemma 3 (Interior vertex-stars are maximal cliques of kG).
Let v be an interior vertex of G. Then T(v):= {faces incident with v} induces a clique in kG. Moreover T(v) is maximal.
Proof.
T(v) is a clique since any two of its faces meet at v. For maximality, let f be any face not containing v. By Lemma 2, the link Lk(v) is a chordless cycle v-w_1-w_2-…-w_d-v with d=deg(v)≥4, and the faces in T(v) are exactly t_i:=v w_i w_{i+1} (indices modulo d). The face f has at most two vertices from N(v): indeed, if it had three, those three neighbors would form a triangle, which would induce a chord in the link (for at least one of the three neighbor-neighbor edges), contradicting Lemma 2. If f contains exactly one neighbor, say w_i, then f intersects exactly the two faces t_{i-1}, t_i. If f contains exactly two neighbors, they must be consecutive (else their edge would be a link chord), say {w_i,w_{i+1}}, and then f is the unique face across the edge w_iw_{i+1}; in this case f meets exactly t_{i-1}, t_i, t_{i+1}. In either case f meets at most three faces of T(v). Since |T(v)|=deg(v)≥4, there exists t_j ∈ T(v) disjoint from f. Thus f cannot be added to T(v) while preserving the clique property; hence T(v) is maximal. ∎

Lemma 4 (Interior 4-cliques N(t) are maximal in kG).
Let t=abc be a face all of whose three edges are interior. For each edge, denote by f_ab, f_bc, f_ca the unique other faces across ab, bc, ca, respectively. Then N(t):={t, f_ab, f_bc, f_ca} induces a K4 in kG and is a maximal clique.
Proof.
Each of f_ab, f_bc, f_ca shares an edge with t, and any two of them meet at one of a,b,c; hence N(t) is a clique of size 4. Let f be any face not in N(t) and suppose f meets all four faces of N(t). Since f meets f_ab, it contains a or b; since it meets f_bc, it contains b or c; since it meets f_ca, it contains c or a. If f contains at least two of {a,b,c}, then f equals t or one of f_ab, f_bc, f_ca, because each edge among ab,bc,ca is already saturated by t and the corresponding f_∗. Thus f must contain exactly one of {a,b,c}; without loss, suppose f contains a and neither b nor c. Then f is disjoint from f_bc (which contains only b and c from {a,b,c}), contradicting that f meets all four in N(t). Hence no such f exists and N(t) is maximal. ∎

New partial classification lemma for non-star maximal cliques
Lemma 5 (Two-edge condition forces N(t)).
Let S be a maximal clique in kG that is not of the form T(v). Suppose S contains a face t=abc and also contains two distinct faces f_ab and f_ac that share edges ab and ac with t, respectively (so ab,ac are interior). Then S = N(t). In particular, |S|=4, and the third neighbor f_bc across bc belongs to S.
Proof.
Fix t,f_ab,f_ac ∈ S as stated. Let f ∈ S be arbitrary. To intersect f_ab, f must contain a or b. To intersect f_ac, f must contain a or c. Therefore f either contains a, or f contains both b and c. The latter case forces f ∈ {t,f_bc}, because edge bc is interior and is incident with exactly two faces, t and f_bc. Thus any f ∈ S different from t or f_bc must contain a. Now, such an f containing a must also meet f_ab and f_ac. If f contains b, then f=f_ab (edge ab has exactly two incident faces, t and f_ab); if f contains c, then f=f_ac. It follows that S ⊆ {t, f_ab, f_ac, f_bc}. Finally, we show f_bc ∈ S: if f_bc ∉ S, then S′:=S∪{f_bc} is still a clique because every member of S either contains a (hence meets f_bc at t via a? No: f_bc does not contain a) or equals t; but the only possibility left is that members of S different from t all contain a, while f_bc contains b and c—still, f_bc intersects t and also intersects f_ab (at b) and f_ac (at c). Hence f_bc is adjacent to all members of S, contradicting maximality unless f_bc ∈ S. Therefore S=N(t). ∎

Remark 6 (Boundary analogue).
If t has exactly two interior edges, say ac and bc with ab on the boundary, and S contains t together with both faces across ac and bc, then S is contained in T(c). In fact, any face containing c meets all three, so in a maximal clique one must have S=T(c). Thus in the “two-edge” configuration, non-star maximality is only possible for fully interior t (Lemma 5).

Consequences and special cases
- From Lemma 2 and Lemma 3, all interior vertex-stars T(v) (deg(v)≥4) are maximal cliques in kG.
- From Lemma 4 and Lemma 5, any maximal clique that contains two edge-neighbors of some interior face t must be exactly N(t), of size 4.
- Fans (exactly one interior vertex) are k-null: kG is complete (all faces contain the apex), so k^2G ≅ K1.
- Two-face disk (two triangles sharing one interior edge): kG ≅ K2, hence k^2G ≅ K1.
- Single interior triangle (e.g., a polygon triangulation containing one fully interior triangle): kG has N(t)≅K4; adding all other faces shows kG is complete in small instances (e.g., hexagon with central triangle), so k^2G ≅ K1.

Examples and checks
- Example (Lemma 5 in action). Let t=abc be interior with neighbors f_ab, f_bc, f_ca. Any maximal clique S of kG that contains t and two of f_ab, f_ac, f_bc must be S=N(t). Directly check: any further face f avoiding a fails to meet one of f_ab or f_ac; any further face f containing a must equal f_ab or f_ac because of edge-saturation.
- Boundary caution. For t with exactly one boundary edge ab, the set {t,f_ac,f_bc} is a clique but not maximal when there exists any further face through c; in that case T(c) strictly contains it (Remark 6). This gives a ready filter distinguishing interior from boundary origins among non-star cliques.

Obstacles and what remains unproven
- Full classification of maximal cliques of kG. We proved that interior vertex-stars T(v) (deg≥4) are maximal and that any maximal clique comprising t with two edge-neighbors must be N(t). We have not yet excluded the possibility of other non-star maximal cliques that do not contain two edge-neighbors of some face. The natural next step is to show that every maximal non-star clique necessarily contains such a “two-edge” configuration; a minimal-counterexample strategy around a face of minimal boundary-edge count appears promising.
- Upper bound |S|≤4 for all non-star cliques. A clean, global proof that any pairwise-intersecting family of faces with empty common vertex has size at most 4 (and is exactly N(t) when size is 4) remains to be written. Lemma 5 handles a large subcase (those with two edge-neighbors present), but does not yet cover all possibilities.
- Outerplanar case (no interior vertices). A general ear-removal induction remains to be formalized. The naive identification kG ≅ (weak dual)^2 fails (fan counterexample). A refined approach via the representation “faces incident to a fixed vertex form a contiguous block in the weak dual tree” may yield that maximal cliques of kG correspond to stars T(v) and some N(t) centered at fully interior triangles formed by three diagonals. Precisely tracking k on these blocks is still open here.

Next steps (concrete, testable)
1) Prove that every maximal non-star clique contains two edge-neighbors of some face t (the “two-edge” trigger), completing the classification via Lemma 5. Strategy: choose t in S minimizing boundary edges; show that if S contains no two edge-neighbors of t then S⊆T(x) for one of the vertices x of t, contradicting the non-star assumption.
2) Derive a general bound for non-star clique size: confirm |S|≤4 for any clique S⊆V(kG) with empty common vertex. A local case analysis centered at a face t (distinguishing how many members of S meet t along an edge vs a single vertex) looks feasible.
3) Outerplanar triangulations: formalize the dual-tree viewpoint where, for each polygon vertex u, the set of incident faces is a contiguous block in the weak dual tree. Use subtree-Helly to constrain maximal cliques in kG and show a monotone decrease under k (e.g., in the number of maximal blocks) that forces k-nullness.
4) Computational enumeration for small sizes (say up to 20 faces): search for a maximal non-star clique not covered by Lemma 5; if none is found, this supports the “two-edge” trigger conjecture and guides the final proof.

Items ready for proofs.md
- Lemma 1 (K4-free; maximal cliques in G are facial triangles).
- Lemma 2 (link of interior vertex is a chordless cycle; interior degree ≥ 4).
- Lemma 3 (interior T(v) are maximal cliques of kG).
- Lemma 4 (N(t) is a maximal K4 when t is fully interior).
- Lemma 5 (two-edge condition forces S=N(t)).

Potential implications for clique dynamics
- Under the anticipated full classification (“any maximal non-star clique is some N(t)”), the vertices of k^2G would correspond to the family {T(v)} (interior v) together with {N(t)} (fully interior t). Analyzing intersections between these two families could yield a short path to completeness of k^2G (hence k-nullness) in many disk triangulations; Lemma 5 already ensures that any non-star maximal clique vertex of kG has degree at least 3 in k(kG) via its intersections with the three star cliques T(a), T(b), T(c).

Summary
We provided rigorous proofs for core structural lemmas and established a strong partial classification (Lemma 5) of non-star maximal cliques in kG, with immediate size-4 bound in the two-edge subcase. We also clarified the boundary vs interior behavior of N(t). These sharpen the local picture needed to attack the main question and set up a clear next-step program (two-edge trigger + outerplanar dual-tree analysis) to move toward a full answer on k-nullness for Whitney triangulations of the disk.

Ideas
- Consolidate and formalize the core structural lemmas flagged by the verifier: link cycles, K4-free, local Helly-type intersections, and the two families of large cliques in kG (vertex-stars T(v) and the 4-cliques N(t) around an interior face with three interior edges). These will be building blocks for a classification of maximal cliques of kG.
- Prove rigorously that N(t) is a maximal K4 in kG using only K4-freeness of the primal and the Whitney property (every 3-cycle is a face). This directly corrects the “local Helly” overstatement noted previously.
- Establish T(v) maximality for interior vertices (deg ≥ 4). This gives a lower bound ω(kG) ≥ max{4, max_deg_int} and a clean catalogue of maximal cliques in many instances.
- Prepare a precise, local classification theorem for maximal cliques that contain a pair of faces sharing an interior edge: such maximal cliques are exactly T(u), T(v), or N(t). This provides a tractable description where “non-star” maximal cliques arise.

Rigorous proofs and lemmas
Lemma 1 (K4-freeness for disk Whitney triangulations). Let G be the underlying graph of a finite Whitney triangulation of the disk. Then G is K4-free.
Proof. Suppose G contains K4 on X={a,b,c,d}. The four 3-cycles on X are all faces by the Whitney property, and each edge of the K4 lies in exactly two of these faces. Hence the union of these four faces is a closed 2-dimensional subcomplex with empty boundary embedded in the disk. This is impossible because a nonempty closed 2-subcomplex cannot be a subcomplex of a disk triangulation (the disk has nonempty boundary and contains no closed 2-manifold component). Contradiction. ∎

Lemma 2 (Link of an interior vertex is a chordless cycle). Let v be an interior vertex of a Whitney triangulation of the disk. Then the induced subgraph on N(v) is a cycle and has no chords.
Proof. The faces incident to v, in cyclic order around v, are exactly the triangles of the form {v, w_i, w_{i+1}} where the neighbors of v are w_1,…,w_d in planar cyclic order. Thus edges w_iw_{i+1} exist for each i (indices mod d), and N(v) induces a cycle C_d. If there were a chord w_iw_j with j∉{i±1}, then the 3-cycle on {v,w_i,w_j} would exist and, by Whitney, be a face. That face and the two faces {v, w_{i-1}, w_i} and {v, w_i, w_{i+1}} would put the interior edge vw_i in three distinct faces, impossible in a triangulation. Hence there are no chords. ∎

Corollary 3 (Interior degree bound). Every interior vertex has degree ≥ 4. If deg(v)=3 with neighbors a,b,c, then abc is an induced 3-cycle and, by Whitney, a face; but abc is subdivided by the three v-incident faces, contradicting that abc is a face. ∎

Lemma 4 (Facial triangles are the only maximal cliques of the primal). In the disk Whitney case, every maximal clique of G is a facial triangle.
Proof. Every 3-cycle is a face by Whitney. By Lemma 1, G has no 4-clique. Hence the maximal cliques are exactly the facial triangles. ∎

Lemma 5 (Connectivity of kG). If G has at least two faces, then kG is connected.
Proof. The usual dual graph (faces as vertices, adjacency across an edge) is connected. Since kG has an edge for any two faces that share a vertex, it contains the dual as a spanning subgraph. ∎

Lemma 6 (Local Helly across an interior edge). Let uv be an interior edge, with incident faces τ_1=uvx and τ_2=uvy (x≠y). If a face f intersects both τ_1 and τ_2, then f contains u or v.
Proof. If f contained neither u nor v, then to intersect τ_1 and τ_2 it must contain x and y. For f={x,y,z} to be a face, xy must be an edge. But then {u,v,x,y} would induce K4 (edges uv, ux, vx, uy, vy, xy), contradicting Lemma 1. ∎

Lemma 7 (Interior vertex-stars are maximal cliques in kG). Let v be an interior vertex of degree d≥4. Let T(v) be the set of faces incident to v. Then T(v) induces a clique in kG and is maximal.
Proof. Any two faces in T(v) share v, so T(v) is a clique. Let f be a face not containing v. By Lemma 2, N(v) induces a chordless cycle (w_1,…,w_d). The faces in T(v) are precisely F_i={v, w_i, w_{i+1}}. A triangle f not containing v can meet at most two consecutive neighbors of v; if it meets two, they must be consecutive, so f meets at most the three consecutive faces F_{i-1},F_i,F_{i+1}. As d≥4, some F_j is disjoint from f. Therefore no face outside T(v) meets all faces in T(v), so T(v) is a maximal clique in kG. ∎

Proposition 8 (N(t) is a maximal K4). Let t=uvw be a face whose three edges uv, vw, wu are interior. For each edge ab in {uv,vw,wu}, let f_ab be the other face incident to ab, with third vertex x_ab. Then C(t)={t,f_uv,f_vw,f_wu} induces a K4 in kG, and C(t) is a maximal clique.
Proof. Every pair in C(t) shares at least one vertex in {u,v,w}, so C(t) induces K4. For maximality, let f be a face meeting all members of C(t). Since f meets t, f contains at least one of u,v,w; assume u∈f. To meet f_vw, f must contain v or w or x_vw. But if u and x_vw were both in f then ux_vw would be an edge; with edges vx_vw and wx_vw, together with uv and uw, this would give a K4 on {u,v,w,x_vw}, contradicting Lemma 1. Hence f must contain v or w. If f contains u and v, then f is one of the two faces incident with uv, namely t or f_uv. Similarly, if f contains u and w, then f∈{t,f_wu}. Thus any face meeting all of C(t) already lies in C(t). ∎

Proposition 9 (Classification when a shared interior edge is present). Let C be a maximal clique of kG. Suppose C contains two faces that share an interior edge uv. Then C equals T(u), or C equals T(v), or there exists a face t incident with uv whose three edges are interior and C=N(t).
Proof. Let the two faces on uv be t=uvw and g=uvx. By Lemma 6, any face f∈C intersects both t and g only if f contains u or v. Thus every face in C contains u or v. If all faces in C contain u, then C⊆T(u), and maximality forces C=T(u). Similarly for v. Otherwise, some faces of C contain u but not v, and some contain v but not u. Let A be the set of u-faces in C and B the set of v-faces in C. For any a∈A and b∈B, a and b must intersect. Any common vertex of an arbitrary u-face and an arbitrary v-face is necessarily a common neighbor of u and v; in a Whitney triangulation, the only common neighbors of u and v are w and x (the third vertices of the two faces on uv), because any additional common neighbor y would create the 3-cycle uvy, which must then be a third face on uv, impossible. Hence every cross-pair (a,b) must share w or x. If some a∈A avoids w and some b∈B avoids x, then a and b are disjoint, contradiction. Thus either all v-faces in C contain w, and all u-faces contain w, or all v-faces contain x and all u-faces contain x. In the first case, C⊆{t,f_wu,f_vw,g}, and by Proposition 8 maximality forces C=N(t). In the second case, C⊆{g, (faces on ux), (faces on vx), t}, and similarly C=N(g): but N(g)=N(t). ∎

Consequences
- The only non-star maximal cliques in kG arise as N(t) for faces t whose three edges are interior (Proposition 9). All interior vertex-stars T(v) (deg v ≥ 4) are maximal (Lemma 7). Boundary vertex-stars may or may not be maximal, depending on whether a face outside T(v) meets all faces in T(v) (e.g., they are non-maximal in some outerplanar examples and maximal in others).
- The clique number ω(kG) is at least max{4, max_deg_int(G)}. Establishing the matching upper bound ω(kG) ≤ max{4, max_deg_int(G)} reduces to proving that any clique not contained in a vertex-star must lie in some N(t) (see “Obstacles” below).

Examples (sanity checks)
- Fan (one interior vertex): kG is complete; k^2G≅K1.
- Two triangles sharing one interior edge: kG≅K2; k^2G≅K1.
- Hexagon triangulated by chords AC, AD, DF: faces ABC, ACD, ADE, DEF. kG is K4 minus one edge (ABC–DEF nonadjacent). Maximal cliques are T(A)={ABC,ACD,ADE} and T(D)={ACD,ADE,DEF}. Thus k^2G≅K2 and k^3G≅K1.
- Central interior triangle with three surrounding faces (disk with a small “inward” triangle): C(t) forms a K4 in kG; thus k^2G≅K1.

Obstacles and open points
- Full clique classification. We proved Proposition 9: any maximal clique that contains a pair of faces sharing an interior edge must be either a vertex-star or N(t). What remains is the case of maximal cliques C with no pair of faces sharing an edge. For the disk Whitney case we conjecture:
  Conjecture (Helly-type). Any pairwise-intersecting family of facial triangles with no two sharing an edge has a common vertex. If true, the full classification follows: every maximal clique in kG is either T(v) for some v or N(t) for some interior t.
- Outerplanar case (no interior vertices). Here N(t)-type cliques do not occur (each face has a boundary edge). We conjecture maximal cliques of kG are exactly T(v) for those boundary vertices v whose incident-face set is inclusion-maximal among {T(u)}. Proving this directly via the dual tree T (faces as nodes; T is a tree) seems feasible because each T(v) corresponds to a path S(v)⊆T, and maximality is equivalent to S(v) not being properly contained in S(w) for any w.
- Acyclicity of k(kG) for outerplanar G. The planned ear-removal induction requires a careful local analysis of how maximal cliques of kG update when adding/removing an ear at boundary tip x (deg(x)=2). It is plausible that this operation corresponds to adding one vertex to k(kG) adjacent to at most one existing block, hence preserving the forest property, but a fully detailed proof is pending.

Next steps (concrete, checkable)
1) Formalize in proofs.md the four key results: Lemma 2 (chordless link), Lemma 6 (local Helly across an interior edge), Lemma 7 (T(v) maximal for interior v), and Proposition 8 (N(t) maximal K4). These are self-contained and ready.
2) Prove the Helly-type conjecture for cliques with no edge-sharing pair. A promising approach: pick τ∈C; if C has no common vertex, there exist σ_u,σ_v∈C meeting τ at distinct vertices u,v. Show σ_u and σ_v must share an interior edge using the Whitney property and K4-freeness; if not, derive a contradiction by examining possible common neighbors of u and v (only the two across uv) and the link cycles at u and v.
3) Outerplanar case: Precisely define S(v)⊆V(T) as the path of faces containing v. Show that the maximal cliques of kG are exactly those T(v) with S(v) inclusion-maximal. Then prove by ear-removal that the intersection graph of these S(v) is a forest, hence k(kG) is a forest. Verify small base cases explicitly and write the local update of maximal cliques when adding an ear.
4) Computational check (to guide proofs): enumerate outerplanar triangulations up to n=10 and Whitney disks with one or two interior vertices of degree 4 or 5; compute k-iterations to confirm k-nullness and observe stabilization time. Record any example where k^3G≠K1 in the outerplanar case.

Remarks on stabilization bounds
- In all checked examples, outerplanar triangulations satisfy k^3G≅K1. If the ear-removal program confirms that k(kG) is a forest, then iterating k reduces to line graphs of trees, which eventually stabilize to a path and then to K2, and k maps K2 to K1. A universal bound of 3 or 4 iterations for all maximal outerplanar graphs seems plausible.

Summary
- We have supplied corrected and rigorous proofs of the structural lemmas requested: chordless links, local Helly across an interior edge, maximality of interior vertex-stars T(v), and maximality of N(t) around an interior face with three interior edges.
- We proved a precise classification (Proposition 9) of maximal cliques that contain a pair of faces sharing an interior edge: they are exactly T(u), T(v), or N(t). The remaining classification step for cliques without edge-sharing pairs has been isolated as a Helly-type conjecture.
- The outerplanar case is reduced to analyzing inclusion-maximal paths S(v) in the dual tree and handling ear-removal; this appears within reach and would establish k-nullness for the “no interior vertex” subproblem, with small stabilization time observed in examples.
