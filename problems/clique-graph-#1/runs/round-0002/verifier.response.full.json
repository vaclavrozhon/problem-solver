For any a\u2208A and b\u2208B, a and b cannot share u or v, so they must share a common neighbor of u and v. By Lemma 12, the only possibilities are w or x.

Indeed, if some a,a\u2032\u2208A satisfy w\u2208a and x\u2208a\u2032, then any b\u2208B would need to contain both w and x to intersect both a and a\u2032, impossible.

Since every a\u2208A must meet every b\u2208B, we must have y=y\u2032.\\nAssume y=w (the case y=x is symmetric).
