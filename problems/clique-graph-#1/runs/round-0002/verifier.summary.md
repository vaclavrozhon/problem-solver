We validated core local structure (K4-free primal; chordless link cycles; interior degree ≥ 4; T(v) maximal; interior-face N(t) maximal K4; local Helly across an interior edge). We identified and corrected a flaw in Prover 1’s “two-edge” lemma and tightened Prover 2’s classification when a shared interior edge is present; a rigorous “anchor” proof is appended to proofs.md. The full classification still lacks a proof for cliques with no edge-sharing pair, and the outerplanar ear-removal program remains to be formalized. Verdict: uncertain.
