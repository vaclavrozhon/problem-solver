{"feedback_md":"Both provers advanced the structural picture and supplied several correct, rigorous local lemmas; however, there are still gaps and one substantive flaw to fix before we can claim a classification of maximal cliques in kG.\n\nWhat is solid\n- K4-freeness of the primal graph for disk Whitney triangulations is correct; use the “closed component” argument (four facial triangles on a K4 seal off a sphere-like 2-complex) rather than unbounded-face arguments. \n- Link-of-v is a chordless cycle; interior vertices have degree ≥ 4. \n- For interior v, T(v) is a clique and is maximal in kG (the chordless link bounds the number of T(v)-faces any external face can meet). \n- For a fully interior face t, N(t) forms a K4 in kG and is maximal (edge-saturation and K4-free arguments). \n- The “local Helly across an interior edge” lemma is correct and very useful: any face meeting both faces across an interior edge must contain one endpoint of the edge.\n\nIssues to fix\n- Prover 1’s Lemma 5 proof is flawed: from “f contains a” it does not follow that f must be f_ab or f_ac; any face through a intersects both f_ab and f_ac at a. The intended conclusion (S=N(t) under a two-edge configuration) is plausible but needs a corrected argument. \n- Prover 2’s Proposition 9 is on the right track but the proof needs a precise “anchor” argument: in the mixed case (both u- and v-faces present), every cross-pair must share w or x; this forces all u-faces to contain the same anchor (say w) and all v-faces the same anchor (also w), yielding C ⊆ {t,g,f_{uw},f_{vw}}, hence C=N(t) by maximality. Also correct the slip “N(g)=N(t)”: they are generally different; the conclusion should be “C=N(t) or C=N(g)”. \n- Full classification remains incomplete: cliques with no pair of faces sharing an edge have not been settled (a Helly-type statement is still conjectural).\n\nNext steps (concrete)\n1) Repair and formalize the “two-edge trigger” classification with the anchor proof (we appended a clean version to proofs.md). 2) Tackle the no-edge-sharing cliques: attempt a minimal-counterexample analysis around a face t of minimal boundary-edge count; or prove a Helly-type property for facial triangles in disk Whitney triangulations. 3) Outerplanar case: write the ear-removal induction carefully; track maximal cliques of kG via contiguous blocks S(v) in the dual tree; aim to show k(kG) is a forest. 4) Computational sweep for small instances (outerplanar and with interior degree 4/5) to test the conjectured classification and k-nullness bounds.","summary_md":"We validated core local structure (K4-free primal; chordless link cycles; interior degree ≥ 4; T(v) maximal; interior-face N(t) maximal K4; local Helly across an interior edge).

Partition C into A (faces containing u but not v) and B (faces containing v but not u). If B=∅, then C=T(u); if A=∅, then C=T(v). If both A and B are nonempty, then every a∈A and b∈B must share a common vertex in {w,x} (the only common neighbors of u and v). This forces all faces in A and B to contain the same anchor (say w), whence A⊆{f_{uw}} and B⊆{f_{vw}}, so C⊆{t,g,f_{uw},f_{vw}} and maximality yields C={t,g,f_{uw},f_{vw}}=N(t).

Let uv be an interior edge with incident faces t=uvw and g=uvx (w\\neq x). If a face f intersects both t and g, then f contains u or v.\nProof. Suppose f contains neither u nor v. Then to meet t and g, f must contain both w and x. Any face containing w and x must include the edge wx. But then the vertices {u,v,w,x} span all six edges uv,uw,vw,ux,vx,wx, yielding a K4, contradicting Lemma 1. ∎\n\nLemma 12 (Common neighbors of an interior edge). With notation as above, N(u)\\cap N(v)=\\{w,x\\}.\nProof. Any common neighbor y of u and v forms the 3-cycle uvy, which must be a face by the Whitney property. Since uv is interior, it has exactly two incident faces, namely t and g. Hence y∈\\{w,x\\}. ∎\n\nProposition 13 (Classification when a shared interior edge is present). Let C be a maximal clique of kG that contains two faces t=uvw and g=uvx sharing the interior edge uv. Then either C=T(u), or C=T(v), or C=N(t)={t,g,f_{uw},f_{vw}}, or C=N(g)={g,t,f_{ux},f_{vx}}, where f_{ab} denotes the unique face across interior edge ab when it exists.\nProof. Let A be the set of faces in C that contain u but not v, and B the set of faces that contain v but not u. If B=\\varnothing, then every face in C contains u, so C⊆T(u), and maximality forces C=T(u). Symmetrically, if A=\\varnothing then C=T(v). Assume A,B≠\\varnothing. For any a∈A and b∈B, a and b cannot share u or v, so they must share a common neighbor of u and v. By Lemma 12, the only possibilities are w or x. Thus for every a∈A and b∈B we have (w∈a∩b) or (x∈a∩b).\nClaim: All faces in A contain the same anchor in {w,x}, and all faces in B contain the same anchor, and these anchors are equal. Indeed, if some a,a′∈A satisfy w∈a and x∈a′, then any b∈B would need to contain both w and x to intersect both a and a′, impossible. Thus all A-faces contain the same anchor; call it y∈{w,x}. The same argument shows all B-faces contain the same anchor y′∈{w,x}. Since every a∈A must meet every b∈B, we must have y=y′.\nAssume y=w (the case y=x is symmetric). Any face in A contains u and w but not v; the only such face is f_{uw} (the face opposite uw), so A⊆{f_{uw}}, and in fact A={f_{uw}}. Similarly, B={f_{vw}}. Therefore C⊆{t,g,f_{uw},f_{vw}}. All four pairwise intersect, so by maximality C must equal this set, i.e., C=N(t). If y=x, the same reasoning yields C=N(g). ∎\n"},"output_update":null}
