Ideas
- Repair the flawed maximality proof for N(t) and formalize a strong “two-edge configuration” classification of maximal cliques in kG. Both hinge on a robust local Helly statement across an interior edge derived from K4-freeness.
- Use these lemmas to constrain non-star maximal cliques: any maximal clique S containing two edge-neighbors of a face t is either a vertex-star T(a) or the 4-clique N(t).
- Set up the remaining target: if a maximal clique has no edge-sharing pair, argue it must be a star T(v) (or can be extended to include an edge-sharing pair, showing it is not maximal). We leave this as the main open subgoal and outline a strategy.

Corrected and new lemmas (rigorous)
Lemma A (Local Helly across an interior edge).
Let uv be an interior edge with incident faces uvw and uvx. If a face f meets both uvw and uvx, then f contains u or v.
Proof.
Suppose not. Then f must contain w (to meet uvw) and x (to meet uvx). Hence wx is an edge, and the subgraph induced by {u,v,w,x} contains edges uv,uw,vw,ux,vx,wx, i.e., a K4, contradicting K4-freeness (Lemma 1 from notes). ∎

Lemma B (Maximality of N(t) corrected).
Let t=abc be an interior face; for each edge ab,bc,ca let the other incident face be f_ab:=ab u, f_bc:=bc v, f_ca:=ca w (u,v,w possibly not distinct). Then N(t):={t,f_ab,f_bc,f_ca} is a clique and is maximal in kG.
Proof.
Clique: t shares an edge with each f_∗. The pairs f_ab,f_ac meet at a; f_ab,f_bc at b; f_ac,f_bc at c.
Maximality: Let f be a face not in N(t) meeting all members of N(t). Consider |f∩{a,b,c}|.
- If |f∩{a,b,c}|=2, say {a,b}, then f must be t or f_ab since ab is interior and saturated; contradiction.
- If |f∩{a,b,c}|=1, say {a} (other cases symmetric). To meet f_bc (which contains exactly b,c,v among {a,b,c,v}), f must contain v (it cannot use b or c). So f={a,v,x} for some x, requiring the edge av. But edges ab,bc,ca together with edges bv,cv (from f_bc) and av form a K4 on {a,b,c,v}, contradicting K4-freeness. Hence this case is impossible.
- If |f∩{a,b,c}|=0, then to meet f_ab, f must contain u; to meet f_bc, it must contain v; to meet f_ca, it must contain w; hence f={u,v,w}. This requires all of uv, vw, wu to be edges. If (say) uv is an edge, then with uw,vw, and edges au,bu from f_ab and av,bv from f_bc we obtain a K4 on {a,b,u,v} (edges ab,au,bu,av,bv,uv), a contradiction; similarly for the other pairs. Thus no such triangle f exists.
Therefore no face outside N(t) meets all four members, and N(t) is maximal. ∎

Lemma C (Two-edge configuration classification: star or N(t)).
Let t=abc be a face with ab and ac interior, and let S be a maximal clique in kG containing t and both f_ab and f_ac. Then either S = T(a) or S = N(t).
Proof.
Let f∈S. By Lemma A applied to the pairs (t,f_ab) and (t,f_ac), f contains a or (simultaneously) b and c. If S contains some f with a∉V(f), then b,c∈V(f), forcing f=f_bc (since bc is interior and saturated). Now any g∈S must meet both t and f_bc; applying Lemma A to the pair (t,f_bc), g contains b or c. If b∈V(g) and a∉V(g), then to meet f_ac, g must contain c or w; but c makes g∈{t,f_bc}, while b–w as an edge would yield a K4 on {a,b,c,w} (since aw,cw exist), impossible; hence g∈{t,f_ab,f_bc}. The same reasoning with c swaps shows S⊆{t,f_ab,f_ac,f_bc}, so by maximality S=N(t). If no f∈S avoids a, then all members contain a and S is a clique contained in T(a); maximality of T(a) (Lemma 3 from notes) yields S=T(a). ∎

Lemma D (Shared interior edge classification: star or 4-clique around one of the two faces).
Let e=uv be an interior edge and suppose a maximal clique S in kG contains two faces t=uvx and g=uvy (x≠y). Then S is T(u), or T(v), or N(t), or N(g).
Proof.
Partition S\{t,g} into A: faces containing u (not v), and B: faces containing v (not u). By Lemma A, every face in S meets {t,g} via u or v; hence S = {t,g} ∪ A ∪ B. If B=∅, then S⊆T(u) and maximality gives S=T(u); similarly if A=∅ then S=T(v). If both A,B≠∅, then for any a∈A and b∈B, a and b must meet. Their only possible shared vertices among {u,v,x,y} are x or y, because any other common vertex z would force triangles u z ⋯ and v z ⋯, creating a K4 with {u,v,z,?}. A standard “anchor” argument then forces all of A to contain the same anchor (say x) and all of B to contain x as well; by edge-saturation, A⊆{f_{ux}} and B⊆{f_{vx}}, hence S⊆{t,g,f_{ux},f_{vx}}; maximality yields S=N(t). The symmetric case yields S=N(g). ∎

Remarks and consequences
- Lemma B fixes the earlier flaw: faces through a meeting N(t) via a and also meeting f_bc via its third vertex v are ruled out because av would force a forbidden K4 on {a,b,c,v}.
- Lemma C replaces the incorrect claim “S=N(t)” by the correct dichotomy “S=T(a) or S=N(t).”
- Any non-star maximal clique that contains a shared edge falls under Lemma D, yielding either a star or a 4-clique N(·). Thus, any non-star maximal clique has size at most 4 and equals N(t) for some interior triangle t, provided it contains a shared edge.

Examples
- Central-triangle hexagon: The three boundary-adjacent faces together with the central triangle form N(t)≅K4 in kG; by Lemma B, N(t) is maximal; k^2 collapses to K1.
- Fans: Every maximal clique is T(v) at the apex; kG is complete, so k^2G≅K1.

Obstacles
- Maximal cliques with no edge-sharing pair remain to be fully classified. We conjecture: any maximal clique S with no shared edges must be a star T(v). The simple 3-cycle example (three boundary-adjacent faces around a central interior triangle) shows that non-star, no-edge-sharing cliques exist, but they are not maximal (they extend to N(t) by adding the central triangle). A proof should show that any such S can be augmented either by adding an interior triangle t to produce an edge-sharing pair (and thus fall under Lemma C/D), or else S already equals a star T(v).

Next steps
- Prove the “no-edge-sharing ⇒ star or extendable” proposition: choose t∈S minimizing the number of boundary edges; analyze how faces in S distribute among the vertices of t and use Lemma A to force the presence of an edge-neighbor, unless all faces share a common vertex v (hence S=T(v)).
- Outerplanar case (no interior vertices): formalize the dual-tree (weak dual) approach. For each boundary vertex v, the incident faces form a path P(v); pairwise intersections of faces correspond to intersections within some P(v). Use subtree-Helly in trees to show that maximal cliques with no shared edges are exactly T(v), and those with a shared edge induce the 4-clique N(t) (central triangle case). This would prove k-nullness for all maximal outerplanar Whitney disks.
- Compute small instances (≤20 faces) to test: (i) the dichotomy from Lemma C/D; (ii) absence of maximal cliques with no edge-sharing beyond stars.

Potential dynamic consequence
- Vertices of kG of type N(t) are adjacent to T(a), T(b), T(c), and no face outside those stars meets all four (Lemma B). This structure should help bound the diameter and guide an argument that k(kG) becomes complete quickly in many disk triangulations, complementing the known k-nullness when all interior degrees ≥ 6.

Summary of additions ready for proofs.md
- Lemma A (local Helly across an interior edge) with K4-free proof.
- Lemma B (corrected maximality of N(t)) with detailed K4 obstructions.
- Lemma C (two-edge configuration: S=T(a) or S=N(t)).
- Lemma D (shared interior edge: S=T(u),T(v),N(t), or N(g)).
These plug the previous gaps and provide a solid local classification whenever an edge-sharing pair appears within a clique of kG. The remaining global step is to eliminate or extend no-edge-sharing maximal cliques, for which a clear plan is outlined.
