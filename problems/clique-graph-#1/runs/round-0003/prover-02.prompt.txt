Problem 7. Clique Dynamics of Whitney triangulations
(suggested by Anna Margarethe Limbach)
Source: Proposed by F. Larrión, V. Neumann-Lara, and M. A.
Pizaña in 2002 [4].
Definitions.
• Given a graph G, its clique graph kG is the intersection graph
of its maximal complete subgraphs, called cliques. This means the
set of cliques of G is the vertex set of kG, and two vertices of kG
are adjacent if and only if they intersect non-trivially as cliques.
The operator k that maps each graph to its clique graph is called the
clique graph operator, and one can apply it iteratively to generate
the sequence of iterated clique graphs k
0G = G, k
1G = kG, k
2G =
k(kG), k
3G, . . ..
• If the sequence of iterated clique graphs of a graph G consists of
pairwise non-isomorphic graphs, G is called k-divergent, otherwise,
k-convergent, and if it contains the graph that consists of a singleton
(and then becomes stationary there) G is called k-null.
• A graph is called locally cyclic, if each open neighbourhood of a
vertex induces a cycle.
• A Whitney-triangulation of a compact surface is a triangulation
such that each triangle of its underlying graph is a face of the
surface. Whitney triangulations of closed surfaces are locally cyclic
with minimum degree ≥ 3 and the only one with minimum degree 3
is the K4 that triangulates the sphere.
From another perspective one can start with such a locally cyclic
graph and obtain a closed surface by “filling in the triangles”.

Question
Is the underlying graph of a finite Whitney triangulation of
the disk always k-null?



11
Related results:
• The K4 is k-null.
• The octahedron graph is k-divergent.
• The icosahedron graph is k-divergent.
• All locally cyclic graphs with minimum degree ≥ 7 are k-convergent.
• Every closed surface admits a k-divergent Whitney triangulation.
• Every closed surface with negative Euler characteristic admits a
k-convergent Whitney triangulation.
• Every Whitney triangulation of the disk such that every interior
vertex has degree ≥ 6 is k-null.

# Research Notes



Structural facts we will use for Whitney triangulations of the disk
- The underlying graph G is K4-free. Otherwise the four 3-cycles of a K4 would all be faces, every edge of that K4 would be incident with two faces within the K4, yielding a closed 2D component incompatible with a disk with boundary.
- Every maximal clique of G is a facial triangle: Whitney implies every 3-cycle is a face, and K4-free prohibits larger cliques.
- The link of an interior vertex v is a chordless cycle on N(v): the faces around v are exactly the triangles (v, w_i, w_{i+1}) in cyclic order; any chord among nonconsecutive neighbors would create a 3-cycle (v, w_i, w_j) that cannot be realized as a face without breaking the manifold structure.
- In particular, interior vertices have degree ≥ 4 (deg 3 would force the neighbor triangle to be a face, contradicting that it is subdivided by the three v-incident faces).
- For an interior vertex v with deg(v) ≥ 4, the set T(v) of faces incident to v is a clique in kG and is maximal: a face f not containing v can include at most two consecutive neighbors of v, hence meets at most three consecutive faces in T(v); for deg(v) ≥ 4 there exists a face of T(v) disjoint from f.
- For an interior face t with all three edges interior, N(t) (t together with the faces across its three edges) induces a K4 in kG and is a maximal clique.

Special k-null families verified
- Fans (exactly one interior vertex): all faces meet at the apex, so kG is complete; hence k^2G ≅ K1.
- Two-face disk (two triangles sharing one interior edge): kG ≅ K2 and k^2G ≅ K1.
- Hexagon with a central interior triangle (outerplanar triangulation with three chords forming a central triangle): exactly four faces; all pairs intersect, so kG ≅ K4 and k^2G ≅ K1.

Open targets and plan
- Classify maximal cliques of kG: Conjecture that every non-star maximal clique is N(t) for some interior face t. Needed: a rigorous reduction showing any pairwise-intersecting family of faces with no common vertex has size ≤ 4 and is contained in N(t).
- Outerplanar case (no interior vertices): pursue ear-removal induction. Track how maximal cliques of kG change and prove that k(kG) remains acyclic (or otherwise identify a monotone invariant). Verify carefully that adding/removing an ear does not create cycles in the clique graph.
- Computation: exhaustively generate small disk Whitney triangulations to test k-iterations and search for counterexamples to k-nullness in low-degree interior regimes (4 and 5).


Additional structural tools and partial classification
- Local Helly across an interior edge: If uv is an interior edge with incident faces uvw and uvx, any face that meets both uvw and uvx must contain u or v. Otherwise it would have to contain both w and x, forcing the edge wx and thus a K4 on {u,v,w,x}, contradicting K4-freeness.
- Shared-edge classification (partial): Let C be a maximal clique in kG that contains two faces t=uvw and g=uvx sharing the interior edge uv. Partition C into A (faces containing u but not v) and B (faces containing v but not u). If B=∅, then C=T(u); if A=∅, then C=T(v). If both A and B are nonempty, then every a∈A and b∈B must share a common vertex in {w,x} (the only common neighbors of u and v). This forces all faces in A and B to contain the same anchor (say w), whence A⊆{f_{uw}} and B⊆{f_{vw}}, so C⊆{t,g,f_{uw},f_{vw}} and maximality yields C={t,g,f_{uw},f_{vw}}=N(t). Symmetrically, if the common anchor is x then C=N(g).
- Caution: Non-star cliques without any edge-sharing pair remain unclassified. A plausible Helly-type statement is that any pairwise-intersecting family of facial triangles with no two sharing an edge has a common vertex; proving this would complete the classification.

Program milestones
- Complete the above shared-edge classification (done; see proofs.md) and then settle the no-edge-sharing case via a minimal-counterexample analysis around a face with minimal number of boundary edges.
- Outerplanar (no interior vertices): model faces as nodes of the dual tree; for each boundary vertex v, the incident faces form a contiguous path S(v). Conjecture: maximal cliques of kG are exactly T(v) with S(v) inclusion-maximal. Aim to show k(kG) is a forest via ear-removal, yielding k-nullness.
- Continue small-instance computations for guidance (particularly with interior degrees 4 and 5).

# Main Results




=== Round 1 Summary ===

This round established core structural lemmas for finite Whitney triangulations of the disk and proved several small k-null cases. Main verified facts: G is K4-free, so maximal cliques of the primal are exactly the facial triangles; the link of any interior vertex is a chordless cycle, forcing interior degree ≥4; for an interior vertex v the incident-face set T(v) is a maximal clique in kG; any interior face t with all three edges interior yields N(t) (t plus the three adjacent faces) which induces a maximal K4 in kG; and kG is connected when G has ≥2 faces. k-nullness was proved for fans (one interior vertex), the two-triangle disk, and the hexagon-with-central-triangle (k^2G ≅ K1). Remaining major gaps are a full classification of maximal cliques of kG (conjecture: every non-star maximal clique is some N(t)) and a completed ear-removal induction for the outerplanar case.

=== Round 2 Summary ===

This round established core local structure for finite Whitney triangulations of the disk and advanced the classification of maximal cliques in kG when an interior edge is shared. Proven: G is K4-free so maximal cliques of the primal are exactly facial triangles; the link of any interior vertex is a chordless cycle, hence interior degree ≥4; for interior v the incident-face set T(v) is a maximal clique in kG; any interior face with all three edges interior yields N(t) that induces a maximal K4 in kG; kG is connected for graphs with ≥2 faces. New structural lemmas: a local Helly lemma across an interior edge, and Proposition 13 classifying any maximal clique containing two faces that share an interior edge (it is T(u), T(v), N(t) or N(g)). Verified k-nullness for fans, the two-face disk, and the hexagon-with-central-triangle. Remaining major gap: classification of maximal cliques with no edge-sharing pair and a completed outerplanar ear-removal proof. Citations: Research Notes; Rigorous Proofs; Verifier Summary.


=== Previous Round Feedback ===

Both provers advanced the structural picture and supplied several correct, rigorous local lemmas; however, there are still gaps and one substantive flaw to fix before we can claim a classification of maximal cliques in kG.

What is solid
- K4-freeness of the primal graph for disk Whitney triangulations is correct; use the “closed component” argument (four facial triangles on a K4 seal off a sphere-like 2-complex) rather than unbounded-face arguments. 
- Link-of-v is a chordless cycle; interior vertices have degree ≥ 4. 
- For interior v, T(v) is a clique and is maximal in kG (the chordless link bounds the number of T(v)-faces any external face can meet). 
- For a fully interior face t, N(t) forms a K4 in kG and is maximal (edge-saturation and K4-free arguments). 
- The “local Helly across an interior edge” lemma is correct and very useful: any face meeting both faces across an interior edge must contain one endpoint of the edge.

Issues to fix
- Prover 1’s Lemma 5 proof is flawed: from “f contains a” it does not follow that f must be f_ab or f_ac; any face through a intersects both f_ab and f_ac at a. The intended conclusion (S=N(t) under a two-edge configuration) is plausible but needs a corrected argument. 
- Prover 2’s Proposition 9 is on the right track but the proof needs a precise “anchor” argument: in the mixed case (both u- and v-faces present), every cross-pair must share w or x; this forces all u-faces to contain the same anchor (say w) and all v-faces the same anchor (also w), yielding C ⊆ {t,g,f_{uw},f_{vw}}, hence C=N(t) by maximality. Also correct the slip “N(g)=N(t)”: they are generally different; the conclusion should be “C=N(t) or C=N(g)”. 
- Full classification remains incomplete: cliques with no pair of faces sharing an edge have not been settled (a Helly-type statement is still conjectural).

Next steps (concrete)
1) Repair and formalize the “two-edge trigger” classification with the anchor proof (we appended a clean version to proofs.md). 2) Tackle the no-edge-sharing cliques: attempt a minimal-counterexample analysis around a face t of minimal boundary-edge count; or prove a Helly-type property for facial triangles in disk Whitney triangulations. 3) Outerplanar case: write the ear-removal induction carefully; track maximal cliques of kG via contiguous blocks S(v) in the dual tree; aim to show k(kG) is a forest. 4) Computational sweep for small instances (outerplanar and with interior degree 4/5) to test the conjectured classification and k-nullness bounds.
