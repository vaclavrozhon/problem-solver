          "text": "{\"summary_md\":\"This round proved core local structure for finite Whitney triangulations of the disk and substantially advanced the clique-classification program. Proven: G is K4-free so primal maximal cliques are facial triangles; the link of any interior vertex is a chordless cycle (hence interior degree \u22654) and T(v) (faces at v) is a maximal clique of kG; any fully interior face t yields N(t) that induces a maximal K4 in kG; kG is connected for \u22652 faces. New tools: a local Helly lemma across an interior edge and a shared-edge classification (any maximal clique containing two faces on an interior edge equals T(u), T(v), or C(t)/C(g)). A three-triangle lemma shows any three pairwise-intersecting facial triangles with no common vertex and no shared edge are the three neighbors of a fully interior face (hence extend to C(t)). Corrections: size-3 T(v) can be maximal; an earlier outerplanar Helly claim was false (hexagon counterexample). Remaining major gaps: classify maximal cliques with no edge-sharing pair and formalize the outerplanar ear-removal induction.
