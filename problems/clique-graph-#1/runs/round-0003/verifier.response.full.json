Let t=abc be a face with ab and ac interior, and suppose a maximal clique S in kG contains t, f_{ab}, f_{ac}. Then S=T(a) or S=C(t) (the latter only when bc is interior).\\nProof. By Lemma 14 applied to (t,f_{ab}) and (t,f_{ac}), any f\u2208S contains a or (b and c). If some f\u2208S avoids a, then f contains b and c, and since a face distinct from t containing bc exists only when bc is interior, we have f=f_{bc}. Now any g\u2208S intersects t and f_{bc}. Applying Lemma 14 to (t,f_{bc}), g contains b or c; combining with the previous constraint forces g\u2208{t,f_{ab},f_{ac},f_{bc}}. Thus S=C(t) by maximality.

By Lemma 14 and the fact that N(u)\u2229N(v)=\\\\{w,x\\\\}, their intersection lies in {w,x}. If some a\u2208A avoids w and some b\u2208B avoids x, then a and b are disjoint, a contradiction. Hence all faces in A\u222aB contain the same anchor y\u2208{w,x}. Then A\u2286{face across uy} and B\u2286{face across vy}, so S\u2286{t,g,f_{uy},f_{vy}}; maximality yields S equal to this 4-set when it exists, i.e., S=C(t) if y=w or S=C(g) if y=x. \u220e\\n\\nLemma 18 (Three triangles, no common vertex, no shared edge). Let \u03c4_1,\u03c4_2,\u03c4_3 be faces that are pairwise intersecting, share no common vertex, and no pair shares an edge. Then there exists a unique fully interior face t=abc whose three opposite neighbors are exactly \u03c4_1,\u03c4_2,\u03c4_3.\\nProof. Let a:=\u03c4_1\u2229\u03c4_2, b:=\u03c4_2\u2229\u03c4_3, c:=\u03c4_3\u2229\u03c4_1. These are distinct; otherwise all three faces would share a vertex. Each \u03c4_i contains exactly two of {a,b,c}, so ab,bc,ca are edges of G. Thus abc is a 3-cycle and hence a face t by Whitney. Since ab is used by t and by \u03c4_2, it is interior; similarly for bc and ca. The uniqueness of the opposite faces across ab, bc, ca finishes the proof. \u220e\\n\"},\"output_update\":null}",
