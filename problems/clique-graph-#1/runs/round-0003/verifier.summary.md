We validated key local lemmas: K4-freeness, chordless links, the interior-edge Helly lemma, maximality of N(t), the two-edge/shared-edge classification (maximal cliques are T(u), T(v), or N(t)/N(g)), and the “three triangles/no common vertex/no shared edge” lemma identifying neighbors of a fully interior face. We flagged errors: Theorem G wrongly excludes size-3 T(v) as maximal; an outerplanar Helly claim is false (hexagon central-triangle counterexample). The remaining gap is a rigorous treatment of cliques with no edge-sharing pair to complete the global classification “maximal cliques are T(v) or N(t)”. Verdict: uncertain.
