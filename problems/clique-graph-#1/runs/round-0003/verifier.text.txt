{"feedback_md":"Both provers improved the local structure significantly and repaired earlier gaps, but a few key claims remain unproven or incorrect.\n\nWhat is solid and can be formalized\n- K4-freeness of the primal (disk Whitney) via the “closed 2D component” argument.\n- Link of an interior vertex is a chordless cycle; interior degree ≥ 4.\n- Local Helly across an interior edge: any face intersecting both faces of an interior edge must contain one endpoint. This is correct and very useful.\n- Maximality of N(t) for a fully interior face t: the corrected proof (ruling out |f∩{a,b,c}|=1 by a K4 obstruction) is clean.\n- Classification when a shared interior edge is present: a maximal clique containing both faces on an interior edge uv must be T(u), T(v), or the 4-clique around one of the two uv-faces. The “anchor” proof is correct.\n- The “three pairwise-intersecting, no common vertex, no shared edge” lemma: such a triple must be the three neighbors of a fully interior face. This is correct and important.\n\nIssues to fix\n- Prover 1’s Lemma C proof has an extraneous step (invoking a vertex w beyond the scope of Lemma A). The intended dichotomy (S=T(a) or S=N(t)) holds; please streamline the proof using only the interior-edge lemma and maximality (if all members contain a, then maximality forces S=T(a)).\n- Prover 2’s Theorem G is incorrect as stated: it excludes size-3 vertex-stars T(v) that can be maximal (e.g., hexagon with faces ABC, ACD, ADE, DEF has maximal cliques T(A) and T(D) of size 3). Remove the “|T(v)|≥4” restriction from the classification statement.\n- Prover 2’s Lemma I (outerplanar Helly) is false: maximal outerplanar triangulations can have fully interior faces (central triangle in a hexagon). The triple {ABC, CDE, EFA} is a counterexample to the claimed Helly property.\n- The “no-edge-sharing” case is not fully closed: Lemma D relies on a triple-selection step that implicitly assumes a Helly-type property. Provide a direct argument that any no-edge-sharing clique is either (i) a subset of some T(v) and thus extendable to T(v) unless it already equals T(v), or (ii) exactly the three neighbors of a fully interior face and hence not maximal because it extends to N(t).\n\nConcrete next steps\n1) Finalize the “no-edge-sharing” case rigorously: prove that a pairwise-intersecting clique with no shared edge is either contained in a single T(v) (and thus extendable unless it already equals T(v)) or is exactly the three neighbors of a fully interior face (hence extendable to N(t)).\n2) State the corrected global classification: Every maximal clique of kG is either T(v) or N(t) (with t fully interior). Provide proofs without size restrictions on T(v).\n3) Outerplanar case: discard Lemma I; instead, use the dual tree and contiguous blocks S(v); classify maximal cliques as T(v) and possibly a face-centered N(t).

Let uv be an interior edge with incident faces t=uvw and g=uvx (w\\neq x). If a face f intersects both t and g, then f contains u or v.\nProof. If f contains neither u nor v, then to meet t and g it must contain both w and x, forcing the edge wx and hence a K4 on {u,v,w,x}, contradicting Lemma 1 (K4-free). ∎\n\nProposition 15 (Maximality of C(t)). Let t=abc be a face whose three edges are interior. For each edge ab, bc, ca let f_{ab}, f_{bc}, f_{ca} denote the other incident face. Then C(t):={t,f_{ab},f_{bc},f_{ca}} induces K4 in kG and is a maximal clique.\nProof. Any two members of C(t) share a vertex among {a,b,c}, so C(t) induces K4. Let f∉C(t) meet all of C(t). Consider |f∩{a,b,c}|. If it is 2, say {a,b}, then f equals t or f_{ab} since ab is interior and saturated—contradiction. If it is 1, say {a}, then to meet f_{bc} (which uses b and c among {a,b,c}) f must contain the third vertex v of f_{bc}, so f={a,v,x} and av is an edge. Then {a,b,c,v} spans K4 via ab,ac,bc and av,bv,cv, a contradiction. If it is 0, then f must contain the third vertices u,v,w of f_{ab}, f_{bc}, f_{ca}, respectively, forcing uv,vw,wu as edges; any such edge together with appropriate edges from two members of C(t) creates a K4, again a contradiction. Hence no such f exists and C(t) is maximal. ∎\n\nProposition 16 (Two-edge configuration: star or C(t)). Let t=abc be a face with ab and ac interior, and suppose a maximal clique S in kG contains t, f_{ab}, f_{ac}. Then S=T(a) or S=C(t) (the latter only when bc is interior).\nProof. By Lemma 14 applied to (t,f_{ab}) and (t,f_{ac}), any f∈S contains a or (b and c). If some f∈S avoids a, then f contains b and c, and since a face distinct from t containing bc exists only when bc is interior, we have f=f_{bc}. Now any g∈S intersects t and f_{bc}. Applying Lemma 14 to (t,f_{bc}), g contains b or c; combining with the previous constraint forces g∈{t,f_{ab},f_{ac},f_{bc}}. Thus S=C(t) by maximality. If no member avoids a, then every member of S contains a, so S⊆T(a). Any face through a meets all members of S, hence maximality forces S=T(a). ∎\n\nProposition 17 (Shared interior edge classification). Let e=uv be an interior edge with incident faces t=uvw and g=uvx (w\\neq x). If S is a maximal clique in kG containing t and g, then S is T(u), or T(v), or C(t), or C(g) (when the corresponding central face has three interior edges).\nProof. Partition S\\{t,g} into A (faces containing u but not v) and B (faces containing v but not u). If A=\\varnothing (resp. B=\\varnothing), then S⊆T(v) (resp. S⊆T(u)), and maximality gives S=T(v) (resp. T(u)). If A,B≠\\varnothing, then for any a∈A and b∈B, a and b must meet. By Lemma 14 and the fact that N(u)∩N(v)=\\{w,x\\}, their intersection lies in {w,x}. If some a∈A avoids w and some b∈B avoids x, then a and b are disjoint, a contradiction. Hence all faces in A∪B contain the same anchor y∈{w,x}. Then A⊆{face across uy} and B⊆{face across vy}, so S⊆{t,g,f_{uy},f_{vy}}; maximality yields S equal to this 4-set when it exists, i.e., S=C(t) if y=w or S=C(g) if y=x. ∎\n\nLemma 18 (Three triangles, no common vertex, no shared edge). Let τ_1,τ_2,τ_3 be faces that are pairwise intersecting, share no common vertex, and no pair shares an edge. Then there exists a unique fully interior face t=abc whose three opposite neighbors are exactly τ_1,τ_2,τ_3.\nProof. Let a:=τ_1∩τ_2, b:=τ_2∩τ_3, c:=τ_3∩τ_1. These are distinct; otherwise all three faces would share a vertex. Each τ_i contains exactly two of {a,b,c}, so ab,bc,ca are edges of G. Thus abc is a 3-cycle and hence a face t by Whitney. Since ab is used by t and by τ_2, it is interior; similarly for bc and ca. The uniqueness of the opposite faces across ab, bc, ca finishes the proof. ∎\n"},"output_update":null}
