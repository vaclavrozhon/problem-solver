Problem 7. Clique Dynamics of Whitney triangulations
(suggested by Anna Margarethe Limbach)
Source: Proposed by F. Larrión, V. Neumann-Lara, and M. A.
Pizaña in 2002 [4].
Definitions.
• Given a graph G, its clique graph kG is the intersection graph
of its maximal complete subgraphs, called cliques. This means the
set of cliques of G is the vertex set of kG, and two vertices of kG
are adjacent if and only if they intersect non-trivially as cliques.
The operator k that maps each graph to its clique graph is called the
clique graph operator, and one can apply it iteratively to generate
the sequence of iterated clique graphs k
0G = G, k
1G = kG, k
2G =
k(kG), k
3G, . . ..
• If the sequence of iterated clique graphs of a graph G consists of
pairwise non-isomorphic graphs, G is called k-divergent, otherwise,
k-convergent, and if it contains the graph that consists of a singleton
(and then becomes stationary there) G is called k-null.
• A graph is called locally cyclic, if each open neighbourhood of a
vertex induces a cycle.
• A Whitney-triangulation of a compact surface is a triangulation
such that each triangle of its underlying graph is a face of the
surface. Whitney triangulations of closed surfaces are locally cyclic
with minimum degree ≥ 3 and the only one with minimum degree 3
is the K4 that triangulates the sphere.
From another perspective one can start with such a locally cyclic
graph and obtain a closed surface by “filling in the triangles”.

Question
Is the underlying graph of a finite Whitney triangulation of
the disk always k-null?



11
Related results:
• The K4 is k-null.
• The octahedron graph is k-divergent.
• The icosahedron graph is k-divergent.
• All locally cyclic graphs with minimum degree ≥ 7 are k-convergent.
• Every closed surface admits a k-divergent Whitney triangulation.
• Every closed surface with negative Euler characteristic admits a
k-convergent Whitney triangulation.
• Every Whitney triangulation of the disk such that every interior
vertex has degree ≥ 6 is k-null.

# Research Notes



Structural facts we will use for Whitney triangulations of the disk
- The underlying graph G is K4-free. Otherwise the four 3-cycles of a K4 would all be faces, every edge of that K4 would be incident with two faces within the K4, yielding a closed 2D component incompatible with a disk with boundary.
- Every maximal clique of G is a facial triangle: Whitney implies every 3-cycle is a face, and K4-free prohibits larger cliques.
- The link of an interior vertex v is a chordless cycle on N(v): the faces around v are exactly the triangles (v, w_i, w_{i+1}) in cyclic order; any chord among nonconsecutive neighbors would create a 3-cycle (v, w_i, w_j) that cannot be realized as a face without breaking the manifold structure.
- In particular, interior vertices have degree ≥ 4 (deg 3 would force the neighbor triangle to be a face, contradicting that it is subdivided by the three v-incident faces).
- For an interior vertex v with deg(v) ≥ 4, the set T(v) of faces incident to v is a clique in kG and is maximal: a face f not containing v can include at most two consecutive neighbors of v, hence meets at most three consecutive faces in T(v); for deg(v) ≥ 4 there exists a face of T(v) disjoint from f.
- For an interior face t with all three edges interior, N(t) (t together with the faces across its three edges) induces a K4 in kG and is a maximal clique.

Special k-null families verified
- Fans (exactly one interior vertex): all faces meet at the apex, so kG is complete; hence k^2G ≅ K1.
- Two-face disk (two triangles sharing one interior edge): kG ≅ K2 and k^2G ≅ K1.
- Hexagon with a central interior triangle (outerplanar triangulation with three chords forming a central triangle): exactly four faces; all pairs intersect, so kG ≅ K4 and k^2G ≅ K1.

Open targets and plan
- Classify maximal cliques of kG: Conjecture that every non-star maximal clique is N(t) for some interior face t. Needed: a rigorous reduction showing any pairwise-intersecting family of faces with no common vertex has size ≤ 4 and is contained in N(t).
- Outerplanar case (no interior vertices): pursue ear-removal induction. Track how maximal cliques of kG change and prove that k(kG) remains acyclic (or otherwise identify a monotone invariant). Verify carefully that adding/removing an ear does not create cycles in the clique graph.
- Computation: exhaustively generate small disk Whitney triangulations to test k-iterations and search for counterexamples to k-nullness in low-degree interior regimes (4 and 5).


Additional structural tools and partial classification
- Local Helly across an interior edge: If uv is an interior edge with incident faces uvw and uvx, any face that meets both uvw and uvx must contain u or v. Otherwise it would have to contain both w and x, forcing the edge wx and thus a K4 on {u,v,w,x}, contradicting K4-freeness.
- Shared-edge classification (partial): Let C be a maximal clique in kG that contains two faces t=uvw and g=uvx sharing the interior edge uv. Partition C into A (faces containing u but not v) and B (faces containing v but not u). If B=∅, then C=T(u); if A=∅, then C=T(v). If both A and B are nonempty, then every a∈A and b∈B must share a common vertex in {w,x} (the only common neighbors of u and v). This forces all faces in A and B to contain the same anchor (say w), whence A⊆{f_{uw}} and B⊆{f_{vw}}, so C⊆{t,g,f_{uw},f_{vw}} and maximality yields C={t,g,f_{uw},f_{vw}}=N(t). Symmetrically, if the common anchor is x then C=N(g).
- Caution: Non-star cliques without any edge-sharing pair remain unclassified. A plausible Helly-type statement is that any pairwise-intersecting family of facial triangles with no two sharing an edge has a common vertex; proving this would complete the classification.

Program milestones
- Complete the above shared-edge classification (done; see proofs.md) and then settle the no-edge-sharing case via a minimal-counterexample analysis around a face with minimal number of boundary edges.
- Outerplanar (no interior vertices): model faces as nodes of the dual tree; for each boundary vertex v, the incident faces form a contiguous path S(v). Conjecture: maximal cliques of kG are exactly T(v) with S(v) inclusion-maximal. Aim to show k(kG) is a forest via ear-removal, yielding k-nullness.
- Continue small-instance computations for guidance (particularly with interior degrees 4 and 5).

Refinements and corrections
- Local Helly across an interior edge (uv with faces uvw and uvx): any face meeting both must contain u or v. This rule underpins all local classifications.
- Maximality of N(t): for a fully interior face t=abc, the set C(t)={t and the three faces across ab, bc, ca} induces K4 in kG and is maximal. Any face f meeting all of C(t) leads to a K4 obstruction.
- Shared-edge classification: Any maximal clique containing two faces on an interior edge uv equals T(u), T(v), or C(t) for one of the two uv-faces t.
- Three-triangle lemma: If three faces are pairwise intersecting, have no common vertex, and no pair shares an edge, then they are exactly the three neighbors of a fully interior face. Consequently, such a 3-set is not maximal since it extends to C(t).

Corrections
- Size-3 vertex-stars T(v) can be maximal (e.g., hexagon with faces ABC, ACD, ADE, DEF has maximal cliques T(A) and T(D)). Remove any restriction |T(v)|≥4 from global classification statements.
- Outerplanar Helly claim is false: maximal outerplanar triangulations can contain a fully interior triangular face (e.g., central triangle ACE in a hexagon). The triple {ABC, CDE, EFA} is pairwise intersecting with no common vertex.

Open tasks
- No-edge-sharing cliques: Prove rigorously that any pairwise-intersecting family with no shared edges is either (i) contained in a single T(v) and hence extendable unless it equals T(v), or (ii) exactly the three neighbors of a fully interior face and thus extendable to C(t). This will complete the classification: maximal cliques of kG are precisely T(v) or C(t).
- Outerplanar case: With the corrected catalogue (T(v) and possibly C(t)), set up an ear-removal induction and track how these maximal cliques transform under k. Aim to show k(kG) becomes a forest or has a decreasing potential.
- Computation: continue exhaustive checks (n≤20 faces; interior degrees 4–5) to test the classification and k-iteration stabilization.

Corrections and completion of the clique classification
- Clique number: ω(kG)=max{ max_v |T(v)|, 4·1_{there exists a fully interior face} }. The value 4 occurs only when some face has all three edges interior.
- Outerplanar note: In a maximal outerplanar triangulation every bounded face has exactly one boundary edge; hence fully interior faces do not occur. Earlier speculation to the contrary is withdrawn.

No-edge-sharing cliques (pairwise-intersecting families of faces with no shared edges)
- Three-triangle lemma (recall): If three faces are pairwise intersecting, share no common vertex, and no pair shares an edge, then they are exactly the three neighbors of a fully interior face t.
- Completion: Let S be a clique in kG with no edge-sharing pair. If ⋂S≠∅ then S⊆T(v). If ⋂S=∅, pick any three F1,F2,F3∈S; by the lemma they are the three neighbors of a fully interior face t=abc. Any fourth face f meeting all three must fall into one of the cases:
  (i) |f∩{a,b,c}|=2: f would share an edge with one of F1,F2,F3, forbidden.
  (ii) |f∩{a,b,c}|=1, say {a}: To meet the neighbor across bc without using b or c, f must contain the opposite vertex x_bc. Then ax_bc must be an edge (for f to be a face), but the edges ab,ac,bx_bc,cx_bc,ax_bc would form a K4 on {a,b,c,x_bc}, impossible.
  (iii) |f∩{a,b,c}|=0: To meet all three neighbors, f must be {u,v,w}, the three opposite vertices across ab, bc, ca. Then the 3-cycles ubv, vcw, wau are forced to be faces by Whitney, and together with t and its three neighbors and the face uvw this creates a closed 2D component (all edges of this subcomplex lie in exactly two faces), contradicting that we triangulate a disk. Hence no such f exists.
Conclusion: Any no-edge-sharing clique is either contained in a vertex-star T(v) (and not maximal unless it equals T(v)) or is exactly the triple of neighbors of a fully interior face (and extends to the maximal K4 N(t)).

Global classification (summary)
- Every maximal clique of kG is either T(v) for some vertex v (interior or boundary; when T(v) is maximal) or N(t) for some fully interior face t. This will be used in analyzing k^2G as the intersection graph on these families.

# Main Results




=== Verifier Summary ===

We validated the local structure: K4-free primal, chordless links, interior-edge Helly, maximality of N(t), and the anchor classification for cliques containing a shared interior edge. The remaining gap (no-edge-sharing cliques) is closed by a corrected case analysis: any such clique is either contained in a vertex-star T(v) or is exactly the three neighbors of a fully interior face and thus extendable to N(t). We corrected the clique-number formula (include 4 only if a fully interior face exists) and retracted the false claim that maximal outerplanar triangulations admit fully interior faces. Final classification is within reach; dynamics (k-nullness) remains open. Verdict: uncertain.

# Rigorous Proofs



Setup and conventions. Let G be the underlying graph of a finite Whitney triangulation of the disk: an embedding on the closed disk in which every 3-cycle of G bounds a facial triangle, each edge is incident with one or two faces (boundary or interior edge, respectively), and the union of the faces is a topological disk.

Lemma 1 (K4-free). The graph G contains no K4 as a subgraph.
Proof. Suppose a K4 with vertex set X={a,b,c,d} occurs. By the Whitney condition, each 3-cycle in X bounds a face, so the four triangles abc, abd, acd, bcd are faces of the triangulation. Every edge of the K4 lies in exactly two of these four triangular faces, hence none of these edges is a boundary edge, and no additional face can be incident with them. Therefore the subcomplex formed by these four faces has empty boundary: it is a closed 2-dimensional component (indeed, the boundary of a tetrahedron). This cannot occur in a triangulation of a disk, whose 2-complex has exactly one component with nonempty boundary and no closed components. Contradiction. ∎

Corollary 2. The maximal cliques of G are exactly its facial triangles.
Proof. By Lemma 1, G has no K4. Any 3-clique is a 3-cycle and hence a facial triangle by the Whitney condition. No edge or single vertex is maximal. ∎

Lemma 3 (Link of an interior vertex). If v is an interior vertex of G with neighbors N(v) listed in cyclic order around v as w_1,\dots,w_d, then for each i the edge w_iw_{i+1} exists and bounds the face (v,w_i,w_{i+1}), and there is no edge w_iw_j for nonconsecutive indices i\notin\{j\pm1\}.
Proof. Each face incident to v is a triangle and uses two consecutive neighbors of v; thus each consecutive pair bounds a face and is an edge. If some nonconsecutive pair w_i,w_j were adjacent, then (v,w_i,w_j) would be a 3-cycle and hence a face by the Whitney condition. This face would overlap the existing fan of faces around v, contradicting that faces form a 2-manifold (the local link at v must be a simple cycle). Hence no such chord exists. ∎

Corollary 4 (Interior degree bound). If v is an interior vertex then deg(v) ≥ 4.
Proof. If deg(v)=3, Lemma 3 implies the neighbors form a triangle w_1w_2w_3, which is a 3-cycle. By Whitney, it must be a face. But the three faces (v,w_1,w_2), (v,w_2,w_3), (v,w_3,w_1) already partition the region bounded by w_1w_2w_3, so w_1w_2w_3 cannot be a face. Contradiction. ∎

Proposition 5 (Vertex-stars are maximal cliques in kG). Let v be an interior vertex with deg(v)=d≥4, and let T(v) be the set of faces incident to v. Then T(v) induces a clique in kG and is maximal.
Proof. Any two faces in T(v) meet at v, so T(v) is a clique. Let f be a face not containing v. By Lemma 3, f contains at most two vertices from N(v), and if it contains two, they must be consecutive along the link cycle. If f contains exactly one neighbor w_i of v, then f intersects only the two faces (v,w_{i-1},w_i) and (v,w_i,w_{i+1}) in T(v). If f contains two consecutive neighbors w_i,w_{i+1}, then f intersects at most the three faces (v,w_{i-1},w_i), (v,w_i,w_{i+1}), (v,w_{i+1},w_{i+2}) in T(v). In all cases, since d≥4, there exists a face in T(v) disjoint from f. Hence no face outside T(v) is adjacent (in kG) to all of T(v), proving maximality. ∎

Proposition 6 (Interior-face 4-cliques). Let t be an interior face whose three edges are interior. Let N(t) be the set consisting of t and the unique face across each edge of t. Then N(t) has size 4 and induces a K4 in kG, and it is a maximal clique of kG.
Proof. Each of the three neighbors of t shares an edge with t, hence is adjacent to t in kG. Two distinct neighbors of t share exactly one vertex (the corresponding vertex of t), so they are adjacent. Thus N(t) induces K4. For maximality, let f be any face not in N(t). If f meets all three neighbors of t, then, since any two of those neighbors intersect only in a vertex of t, f must contain at least two vertices of t. But any face containing two vertices of t must use an edge of t, and each edge of t already has exactly two incident faces (t and its opposite neighbor), so no such f exists. Therefore N(t) is maximal. ∎

Lemma 7 (Connectivity of kG). If G has at least two faces, then kG is connected.
Proof. The dual graph whose vertices are faces of G and edges join faces that share an edge is connected (the 2-complex is a disk). Since kG contains this dual graph as a spanning subgraph (it has at least those adjacencies, and possibly more when faces meet at a vertex), kG is connected. ∎

Special k-null cases.
Proposition 8 (Fans). If G has exactly one interior vertex v (a fan triangulation), then kG is complete, hence k^2G≅K1.
Proof. Every face contains v, so any two faces intersect. The clique graph of a complete graph is K1. ∎

Proposition 9 (Two faces). If G consists of two triangles sharing an interior edge, then kG≅K2 and k^2G≅K1. ∎

Proposition 10 (Central interior triangle in a hexagon). Consider a maximal outerplanar triangulation obtained from a 6-cycle A–B–C–D–E–F–A by adding chords AC, CE, EA. The faces are ABC, CDE, EFA, and ACE, and every pair of faces intersects. Hence kG≅K4 and k^2G≅K1. ∎


Lemma 11 (Local Helly across an interior edge). Let uv be an interior edge with incident faces t=uvw and g=uvx (w\neq x). If a face f intersects both t and g, then f contains u or v.
Proof. Suppose f contains neither u nor v. Then to meet t and g, f must contain both w and x. Any face containing w and x must include the edge wx. But then the vertices {u,v,w,x} span all six edges uv,uw,vw,ux,vx,wx, yielding a K4, contradicting Lemma 1. ∎

Lemma 12 (Common neighbors of an interior edge). With notation as above, N(u)\cap N(v)=\{w,x\}.
Proof. Any common neighbor y of u and v forms the 3-cycle uvy, which must be a face by the Whitney property. Since uv is interior, it has exactly two incident faces, namely t and g. Hence y∈\{w,x\}. ∎

Proposition 13 (Classification when a shared interior edge is present). Let C be a maximal clique of kG that contains two faces t=uvw and g=uvx sharing the interior edge uv. Then either C=T(u), or C=T(v), or C=N(t)={t,g,f_{uw},f_{vw}}, or C=N(g)={g,t,f_{ux},f_{vx}}, where f_{ab} denotes the unique face across interior edge ab when it exists.
Proof. Let A be the set of faces in C that contain u but not v, and B the set of faces that contain v but not u. If B=\varnothing, then every face in C contains u, so C⊆T(u), and maximality forces C=T(u). Symmetrically, if A=\varnothing then C=T(v). Assume A,B≠\varnothing. For any a∈A and b∈B, a and b cannot share u or v, so they must share a common neighbor of u and v. By Lemma 12, the only possibilities are w or x. Thus for every a∈A and b∈B we have (w∈a∩b) or (x∈a∩b).
Claim: All faces in A contain the same anchor in {w,x}, and all faces in B contain the same anchor, and these anchors are equal. Indeed, if some a,a′∈A satisfy w∈a and x∈a′, then any b∈B would need to contain both w and x to intersect both a and a′, impossible. Thus all A-faces contain the same anchor; call it y∈{w,x}. The same argument shows all B-faces contain the same anchor y′∈{w,x}. Since every a∈A must meet every b∈B, we must have y=y′.
Assume y=w (the case y=x is symmetric). Any face in A contains u and w but not v; the only such face is f_{uw} (the face opposite uw), so A⊆{f_{uw}}, and in fact A={f_{uw}}. Similarly, B={f_{vw}}. Therefore C⊆{t,g,f_{uw},f_{vw}}. All four pairwise intersect, so by maximality C must equal this set, i.e., C=N(t). If y=x, the same reasoning yields C=N(g). ∎


We continue with a finite Whitney triangulation G of the disk.

Lemma 14 (Local Helly across an interior edge). Let uv be an interior edge with incident faces t=uvw and g=uvx (w\neq x). If a face f intersects both t and g, then f contains u or v.
Proof. If f contains neither u nor v, then to meet t and g it must contain both w and x, forcing the edge wx and hence a K4 on {u,v,w,x}, contradicting Lemma 1 (K4-free). ∎

Proposition 15 (Maximality of C(t)). Let t=abc be a face whose three edges are interior. For each edge ab, bc, ca let f_{ab}, f_{bc}, f_{ca} denote the other incident face. Then C(t):={t,f_{ab},f_{bc},f_{ca}} induces K4 in kG and is a maximal clique.
Proof. Any two members of C(t) share a vertex among {a,b,c}, so C(t) induces K4. Let f∉C(t) meet all of C(t). Consider |f∩{a,b,c}|. If it is 2, say {a,b}, then f equals t or f_{ab} since ab is interior and saturated—contradiction. If it is 1, say {a}, then to meet f_{bc} (which uses b and c among {a,b,c}) f must contain the third vertex v of f_{bc}, so f={a,v,x} and av is an edge. Then {a,b,c,v} spans K4 via ab,ac,bc and av,bv,cv, a contradiction. If it is 0, then f must contain the third vertices u,v,w of f_{ab}, f_{bc}, f_{ca}, respectively, forcing uv,vw,wu as edges; any such edge together with appropriate edges from two members of C(t) creates a K4, again a contradiction. Hence no such f exists and C(t) is maximal. ∎

Proposition 16 (Two-edge configuration: star or C(t)). Let t=abc be a face with ab and ac interior, and suppose a maximal clique S in kG contains t, f_{ab}, f_{ac}. Then S=T(a) or S=C(t) (the latter only when bc is interior).
Proof. By Lemma 14 applied to (t,f_{ab}) and (t,f_{ac}), any f∈S contains a or (b and c). If some f∈S avoids a, then f contains b and c, and since a face distinct from t containing bc exists only when bc is interior, we have f=f_{bc}. Now any g∈S intersects t and f_{bc}. Applying Lemma 14 to (t,f_{bc}), g contains b or c; combining with the previous constraint forces g∈{t,f_{ab},f_{ac},f_{bc}}. Thus S=C(t) by maximality. If no member avoids a, then every member of S contains a, so S⊆T(a). Any face through a meets all members of S, hence maximality forces S=T(a). ∎

Proposition 17 (Shared interior edge classification). Let e=uv be an interior edge with incident faces t=uvw and g=uvx (w\neq x). If S is a maximal clique in kG containing t and g, then S is T(u), or T(v), or C(t), or C(g) (when the corresponding central face has three interior edges).
Proof. Partition S\{t,g} into A (faces containing u but not v) and B (faces containing v but not u). If A=\varnothing (resp. B=\varnothing), then S⊆T(v) (resp. S⊆T(u)), and maximality gives S=T(v) (resp. T(u)). If A,B≠\varnothing, then for any a∈A and b∈B, a and b must meet. By Lemma 14 and the fact that N(u)∩N(v)=\{w,x\}, their intersection lies in {w,x}. If some a∈A avoids w and some b∈B avoids x, then a and b are disjoint, a contradiction. Hence all faces in A∪B contain the same anchor y∈{w,x}. Then A⊆{face across uy} and B⊆{face across vy}, so S⊆{t,g,f_{uy},f_{vy}}; maximality yields S equal to this 4-set when it exists, i.e., S=C(t) if y=w or S=C(g) if y=x. ∎

Lemma 18 (Three triangles, no common vertex, no shared edge). Let τ_1,τ_2,τ_3 be faces that are pairwise intersecting, share no common vertex, and no pair shares an edge. Then there exists a unique fully interior face t=abc whose three opposite neighbors are exactly τ_1,τ_2,τ_3.
Proof. Let a:=τ_1∩τ_2, b:=τ_2∩τ_3, c:=τ_3∩τ_1. These are distinct; otherwise all three faces would share a vertex. Each τ_i contains exactly two of {a,b,c}, so ab,bc,ca are edges of G. Thus abc is a 3-cycle and hence a face t by Whitney. Since ab is used by t and by τ_2, it is interior; similarly for bc and ca. The uniqueness of the opposite faces across ab, bc, ca finishes the proof. ∎


Proposition (No-edge-sharing cliques are extendable). Let G be a Whitney triangulation of the disk. Let S be a clique of kG (i.e., a pairwise-intersecting family of facial triangles) such that no two members of S share an edge. Then either (i) there exists a vertex v with S⊆T(v), or (ii) |S|=3 and S is the set of the three opposite neighbors of a unique fully interior face t=abc. In particular, in case (ii) S is not maximal since S∪{t} is a larger clique, and in case (i) S is not maximal unless S=T(v).
Proof. If ⋂S≠∅ pick v in the intersection and we are in (i). Otherwise, pick distinct F1,F2,F3∈S. They are pairwise intersecting, have empty triple intersection, and no pair shares an edge, so by the three-triangle lemma there is a fully interior face t=abc whose opposite neighbors across ab, bc, ca are exactly {F1,F2,F3}. Suppose, for a contradiction, there is f∈S\{F1,F2,F3}. Consider k:=|f∩{a,b,c}|.
- If k=2, then f shares an edge with at least one of F1,F2,F3, contrary to the hypothesis on S.
- If k=1, say f contains a only among {a,b,c}. To intersect the neighbor across bc (call it f_bc), f cannot use b or c, hence must contain the opposite vertex x_bc of f_bc; but then for f to be a face, ax_bc must be an edge. The edges ab, ac, bx_bc, cx_bc, and ax_bc would form a K4 on {a,b,c,x_bc}, contradicting K4-freeness.
- If k=0, then to intersect each of the three neighbors across ab, bc, ca, the face f must contain each of their opposite vertices u, v, w, so f={u,v,w}. Then the 3-cycles ubv, vcw, and wau exist and, by the Whitney property, must be faces. The subcomplex consisting of t, its three neighbors, f, and these three additional faces has empty boundary (every edge in it lies in exactly two of these faces), i.e., it is a closed 2D component. This is impossible in a triangulation of a disk. Hence no such f exists.
Thus S must be exactly {F1,F2,F3}, establishing (ii). ∎

Theorem (Global classification of maximal cliques of kG). Let G be a Whitney triangulation of the disk. Then every maximal clique of kG is either T(v) for some vertex v (interior or boundary) or N(t)=C(t) for some fully interior face t. Conversely, each such T(v) (when maximal) and each N(t) is a maximal clique.
Proof. Let S be a maximal clique. If S contains two faces sharing an interior edge, the anchor classification shows S=T(u), T(v), or N(t) for one of the two faces on that edge. If S has no edge-sharing pair, the proposition above shows S⊆T(w) for some w or S is the three neighbors of a fully interior face t, in which case S is not maximal because S∪{t} is a larger clique. Hence S is of the stated types. The converse implications have been established earlier. ∎

Corollary (Clique number). Let τ(v)=|T(v)|. Then
ω(kG)=max{ max_v τ(v), 4·1_{there exists a fully interior face in G} }.
Proof. By the theorem, the only maximal cliques are the T(v) and the N(t) when t is fully interior; |N(t)|=4. ∎
