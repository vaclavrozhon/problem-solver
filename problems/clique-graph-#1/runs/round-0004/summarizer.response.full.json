Key tools were K4-freeness, chordless interior links (deg\u22654), a local Helly lemma across interior edges, a shared-edge clique classification, and a three-triangle lemma for no-edge-sharing families. Main conclusion: every maximal clique of kG is either a vertex-star T(v) or the 4-set N(t) arising from a fully interior face t (so \u03c9(kG)=max_v|T(v)| or 4 if some fully interior face exists). Verified k-nullness in several small families (fans, two-triangle disk, hexagon+central triangle). Corrections: size-3 T(v) can be maximal; an earlier outerplanar Helly claim was false.
