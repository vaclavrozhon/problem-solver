  "feedback_md": "Strong progress: both provers now converge on a local catalogue of maximal cliques in kG and supplied (mostly) correct tools to finish the classification. The shared-interior-edge (anchor) classification and the corrected maximality of N(t) are sound. The three-triangle lemma is correct and essential. The remaining gap was the \u201cno edge-sharing\u201d case; the intended resolution is right, but the written proofs need tightening.\n\nMain fixes needed\n- No-edge-sharing cliques: Prover 1\u2019s Proposition 2 argument omits the critical case |f\u2229{a,b,c}|=0 and does not justify the |f\u2229{a,b,c}|=1 impossibility. You must treat both subcases rigorously. For |f\u2229{a,b,c}|=1, use the K4 obstruction (edge a\u2013x_bc would create a K4 on {a,b,c,x_bc}). For |f\u2229{a,b,c}|=0, the only way to meet all three neighbors {f_ab,f_bc,f_ca} is f={u,v,w} (the three opposite vertices), which forces additional 3-cycles ubv, vcw, wau to be faces by Whitney, yielding a closed 2D component with empty boundary; impossible in a disk. Prover 2\u2019s sketch (\u201cmust contain at least two of {a,b,c}\u201d) is not generally valid and should be replaced by this case analysis.\n- Clique number: Prover 1\u2019s Corollary 4 should read \u03c9(kG)=max{max_v |T(v)|, 4\u00b71_{\u2203 fully interior face}}. Without a fully interior face, 4 need not be realized.\n- Outerplanar remarks: The earlier claim that maximal outerplanar triangulations admit fully interior faces is false. In a maximal outerplanar triangulation, every bounded face has exactly one boundary edge, so no fully interior t exists; C(t)-type cliques do not occur there. Please retract and realign the outerplanar plan accordingly.\n\nWhat is ready to formalize\n- K4-freeness via the \u201cclosed component\u201d argument.\n- Link cycles; interior degree \u2265 4.\n- Local Helly across an interior edge.\n- Anchor-based classification when a shared interior edge is present: maximal cliques are T(u), T(v), or N(t) for one of the two uv-faces.\n- Three-triangle lemma (neighbors of a fully interior face).\n- No-edge-sharing classification with the corrected case analysis above.\n\nNext steps\n1) Insert the corrected no-edge-sharing proof and the precise \u03c9(kG) formula into proofs.md; then state the final classification: every maximal clique of kG is T(v) or N(t). 2) Outerplanar case: with C(t) absent, kG\u2019s maximal cliques are exactly the maximal vertex-stars. Model k(kG) as intersections of these stars; attempt an ear-removal induction or a tree-path intersection model to show k-nullness. 3) Begin explicit k^2G analysis using intersections among T(\u00b7) and N(\u00b7) (where present) and look for a decreasing potential toward completeness.\n",

The value 4 occurs only when some face has all three edges interior.\n- Outerplanar note: In a maximal outerplanar triangulation every bounded face has exactly one boundary edge; hence fully interior faces do not occur. Earlier speculation to the contrary is withdrawn.\n\nNo-edge-sharing cliques (pairwise-intersecting families of faces with no shared edges)\n- Three-triangle lemma (recall): If three faces are pairwise intersecting, share no common vertex, and no pair shares an edge, then they are exactly the three neighbors of a fully interior face t.\n- Completion: Let S be a clique in kG with no edge-sharing pair. If \u22c2S\u2260\u2205 then S\u2286T(v). If \u22c2S=\u2205, pick any three F1,F2,F3\u2208S; by the lemma they are the three neighbors of a fully interior face t=abc. Any fourth face f meeting all three must fall into one of the cases:\n  (i) |f\u2229{a,b,c}|=2: f would share an edge with one of F1,F2,F3, forbidden.\n  (ii) |f\u2229{a,b,c}|=1, say {a}: To meet the neighbor across bc without using b or c, f must contain the opposite vertex x_bc. Then ax_bc must be an edge (for f to be a face), but the edges ab,ac,bx_bc,cx_bc,ax_bc would form a K4 on {a,b,c,x_bc}, impossible.\n  (iii) |f\u2229{a,b,c}|=0: To meet all three neighbors, f must be {u,v,w}, the three opposite vertices across ab, bc, ca. Then the 3-cycles ubv, vcw, wau are forced to be faces by Whitney, and together with t and its three neighbors and the face uvw this creates a closed 2D component (all edges of this subcomplex lie in exactly two faces), contradicting that we triangulate a disk. Hence no such f exists.\nConclusion: Any no-edge-sharing clique is either contained in a vertex-star T(v) (and not maximal unless it equals T(v)) or is exactly the triple of neighbors of a fully interior face (and extends to the maximal K4 N(t)).\n\nGlobal classification (summary)\n- Every maximal clique of kG is either T(v) for some vertex v (interior or boundary; when T(v) is maximal) or N(t) for some fully interior face t. This will be used in analyzing k^2G as the intersection graph on these families.\n"

    "content": "Proposition (No-edge-sharing cliques are extendable). Let G be a Whitney triangulation of the disk. Let S be a clique of kG (i.e., a pairwise-intersecting family of facial triangles) such that no two members of S share an edge. Then either (i) there exists a vertex v with S\u2286T(v), or (ii) |S|=3 and S is the set of the three opposite neighbors of a unique fully interior face t=abc. In particular, in case (ii) S is not maximal since S\u222a{t} is a larger clique, and in case (i) S is not maximal unless S=T(v).\nProof. If \u22c2S\u2260\u2205 pick v in the intersection and we are in (i). Otherwise, pick distinct F1,F2,F3\u2208S. They are pairwise intersecting, have empty triple intersection, and no pair shares an edge, so by the three-triangle lemma there is a fully interior face t=abc whose opposite neighbors across ab, bc, ca are exactly {F1,F2,F3}. Suppose, for a contradiction, there is f\u2208S\\{F1,F2,F3}. Consider k:=|f\u2229{a,b,c}|.\n- If k=2, then f shares an edge with at least one of F1,F2,F3, contrary to the hypothesis on S.\n- If k=1, say f contains a only among {a,b,c}. To intersect the neighbor across bc (call it f_bc), f cannot use b or c, hence must contain the opposite vertex x_bc of f_bc; but then for f to be a face, ax_bc must be an edge. The edges ab, ac, bx_bc, cx_bc, and ax_bc would form a K4 on {a,b,c,x_bc}, contradicting K4-freeness.\n- If k=0, then to intersect each of the three neighbors across ab, bc, ca, the face f must contain each of their opposite vertices u, v, w, so f={u,v,w}. Then the 3-cycles ubv, vcw, and wau exist and, by the Whitney property, must be faces. The subcomplex consisting of t, its three neighbors, f, and these three additional faces has empty boundary (every edge in it lies in exactly two of these faces), i.e., it is a closed 2D component. This is impossible in a triangulation of a disk. Hence no such f exists.\nThus S must be exactly {F1,F2,F3}, establishing (ii). \u220e\n\nTheorem (Global classification of maximal cliques of kG). Let G be a Whitney triangulation of the disk. Then every maximal clique of kG is either T(v) for some vertex v (interior or boundary) or N(t)=C(t) for some fully interior face t. Conversely, each such T(v) (when maximal) and each N(t) is a maximal clique.\nProof. Let S be a maximal clique. If S contains two faces sharing an interior edge, the anchor classification shows S=T(u), T(v), or N(t) for one of the two faces on that edge. If S has no edge-sharing pair, the proposition above shows S\u2286T(w) for some w or S is the three neighbors of a fully interior face t, in which case S is not maximal because S\u222a{t} is a larger clique. Hence S is of the stated types. The converse implications have been established earlier. \u220e\n\nCorollary (Clique number). Let \u03c4(v)=|T(v)|. Then\n\u03c9(kG)=max{ max_v \u03c4(v), 4\u00b71_{there exists a fully interior face in G} }.\nProof. By the theorem, the only maximal cliques are the T(v) and the N(t) when t is fully interior; |N(t)|=4. \u220e\n"
