We validated the local structure: K4-free primal, chordless links, interior-edge Helly, maximality of N(t), and the anchor classification for cliques containing a shared interior edge. The remaining gap (no-edge-sharing cliques) is closed by a corrected case analysis: any such clique is either contained in a vertex-star T(v) or is exactly the three neighbors of a fully interior face and thus extendable to N(t). We corrected the clique-number formula (include 4 only if a fully interior face exists) and retracted the false claim that maximal outerplanar triangulations admit fully interior faces. Final classification is within reach; dynamics (k-nullness) remains open. Verdict: uncertain.
