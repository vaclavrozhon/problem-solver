  "summary_md": "Last round established structural reductions and corrected formulas for Whitney triangulations of the disk. Key results: the underlying graph of a Whitney disc triangulation is K4-free, so all maximal cliques are facial triangles. The face-degree formula in kG was corrected for boundary faces: for a facial triangle f={a,b,c}, deg_{kG}(f)=deg(a)+deg(b)+deg(c)\u22126\u2212B(f)+Eb(f) (B = number of boundary vertices of f, Eb = number of boundary edges). For maximal outerplanar discs (triangulated polygons) Tri(D) has the Helly property, hence maximal cliques of k(D) are exactly P_v (facial triangles incident to a boundary vertex v with deg\u22653), and k^2(D) \u2245 D[S] where S={v:deg_D(v)\u22653} \u2014 a two-step \u201cear-pruning\u201d mechanism that yields k-nullness for fans (k^2 \u2245 K1). Remaining gaps were identified (a wrong earlier degree formula and incomplete propositions) and concrete next steps proposed (rigorous Helly\u2192common-vertex proof for general discs, formal monotone invariant for D\u21a6D[S], and computational checks).
