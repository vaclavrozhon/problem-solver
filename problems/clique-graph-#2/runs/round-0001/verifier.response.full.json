Let G be the underlying graph of a finite Whitney triangulation of the disc (every 3-cycle bounds a triangular face). Then G contains no subgraph isomorphic to K4.\\nProof. Suppose a,b,c,d induce a K4. Its four 3-cycles abc, abd, acd, bcd are triangles of G and, by the Whitney property, all four must be faces. Consider the 2-dimensional subcomplex X formed by taking these four triangular faces together with their edges and vertices. Each edge of X lies in exactly two of these faces, and X has f=4 faces, e=6 edges, v=4 vertices, hence \u03c7(X)=v\u2212e+f=2. Thus X is a combinatorial 2-sphere. But a triangulated disc cannot contain a closed spherical subcomplex: in a disc triangulation, every boundary edge is incident with exactly one face, whereas each edge of X is already incident with two faces within X, leaving no way to place X along the boundary. Contradiction. \u220e\\n\\nCorollary 2 (Maximal cliques of G). In the setting of Lemma 1, the clique number of G is 3, and the maximal cliques of G are exactly the facial triangles.\\nProof. By Lemma 1, \u03c9(G)\u22643. Every edge of a Whitney triangulation lies in at least one facial triangle, so every 2-clique extends to a 3-clique. Since every 3-cycle is a face, the 3-cliques are precisely facial triangles and are maximal. \u220e\\n\\nLemma 3 (Degree of a face in kG with boundary). Let G be the underlying graph of a finite Whitney triangulation of a disc. For a facial triangle f={a,b,c}, let B(f) be the number of boundary vertices among {a,b,c} and let Eb(f) be the number of boundary edges of f. Then\\n  deg_{kG}(f) = deg_G(a) + deg_G(b) + deg_G(c) \u2212 6 \u2212 B(f) + Eb(f).\\nIn particular, for closed triangulations (no boundary) one has deg_{kG}(f)=deg(a)+deg(b)+deg(c)\u22126.\\nProof. A triangle t\u2260f is adjacent to f in kG iff it either shares an edge with f or shares exactly one vertex. For v\u2208{a,b,c}, the number of facial triangles through v equals deg_G(v) if v is interior and deg_G(v)\u22121 if v is on the boundary. Summing over v and excluding f itself gives \u03a3_v (deg_G(v)\u2212\u03c7_B(v)) \u2212 3 = deg_G(a)+deg_G(b)+deg_G(c) \u2212 B(f) \u2212 3. Triangles sharing an edge with f were counted twice; for each edge e of f there are t_e\u22121 such triangles distinct from f, where t_e\u2208{1,2} is the number of facial triangles containing e. Subtracting (t_{ab}\u22121)+(t_{bc}\u22121)+(t_{ca}\u22121) yields\\n deg_{kG}(f) = deg_G(a)+deg_G(b)+deg_G(c) \u2212 B(f) \u2212 3 \u2212 (t_{ab}+t_{bc}+t_{ca}) + 3.\\nNow t_{ab}+t_{bc}+t_{ca} equals 2\u00b7(# interior edges of f) + 1\u00b7(# boundary edges of f) = 2(3\u2212Eb(f)) + Eb(f) = 6 \u2212 Eb(f). Hence the claimed formula. \u220e\\n\\nCorollary 4 (Closed case summation identity). If G triangulates a closed surface, then for its clique graph kG with vertex set the facial triangles,\\n  \u03a3_{f} deg_{kG}(f) = \u03a3_{v} deg_G(v)^2 \u2212 6F,\\nwhere F is the number of facial triangles of G.

Summing Lemma 3 over all faces and simplifying yields the identity. The bound follows from Cauchy\u2013Schwarz and F=2|E(G)|/3. \u220e\\n\\nProposition 5 (Maximal outerplanar discs: structure of k and k^2).

Then k^2(D) \u2245 D[S] (the subgraph induced by S).\\nProof. (a) Maximal outerplanar graphs are chordal (indeed 2-trees). In a chordal graph, maximal cliques satisfy the running-intersection property, which implies the Helly property for the family of maximal cliques. Here, the maximal cliques are exactly the facial triangles.\\n(b) For any v, triangles in P_v pairwise intersect at v, so P_v is a clique in k(D). Conversely, let C be a maximal clique in k(D). Then the corresponding triangles form a pairwise-intersecting family, hence by (a) share a common vertex v; thus C\u2286P_v, and maximality gives C=P_v. If deg_D(v)=2, then |P_v|=1 and P_v is not maximal in k(D), as that triangle also lies in P_u for its other two vertices u.\\n(c) Vertices of k^2(D) correspond to maximal cliques of k(D), i.e., to P_v with v\u2208S. Two such vertices P_u,P_v are adjacent in k^2(D) iff P_u\u2229P_v\u2260\u2205, i.e., iff there exists a facial triangle containing both u and v, equivalently iff uv\u2208E(D). Hence k^2(D)\u2245D[S]. \u220e\\n\\nCorollary 6 (Fans are k-null in \u22642 steps). Let D be a fan (one interior vertex x adjacent to all boundary vertices). Then k(D)\u2245K_{deg_D(x)} and k^2(D)\u2245K_1.\\nProof. Every facial triangle contains x, so k(D) is complete on the set of faces. The clique graph of a clique is a single vertex. \u220e\"},\"output_update\":null}",
