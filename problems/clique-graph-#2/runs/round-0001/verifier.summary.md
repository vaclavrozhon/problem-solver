Verified: (i) K4-free for Whitney disc triangulations; thus maximal cliques in G are facial triangles. (ii) Correct boundary-aware degree formula for deg_k at a face: deg(a)+deg(b)+deg(c)−6−B+Eb. (iii) For maximal outerplanar discs, maximal cliques of k(D) are P_v and k^2(D)≅D[S] where S={deg≥3}. Found issues: Prover 1’s degree formula is wrong on boundaries; Proposition 5 incomplete; Prover 2’s sum identity has a −6F typo; zig-zag collapse claim is unsupported. Next: complete the “pairwise-intersecting triangles ⇒ common vertex” proof for discs; prove termination of the k^2-pruning for maximal outerplanar graphs; develop a monotone two-step potential Φ for general discs.
