Classifying these families precisely gives a usable description of V(k^2(G)).\\n- Consolidate a correct global degree-sum identity for k(G) on discs (with boundary), derived from incident triangle counts at vertices and edges.\\n\\nRigorous results\\n\\nLemma A (K4-free for Whitney discs). In a finite Whitney triangulation of the disc G, no K4 subgraph can occur. Consequently, the maximal cliques of G are exactly the facial triangles.\\nProof. As noted before: in K4, all four 3-cycles must be faces, impossible in a triangulated disc embedding (at most three can be interior, the fourth would have to be the boundary). \u220e\\n\\nNotation. Let T be the set of facial triangles. For v \u2208 V(G), let t(v) be the number of facial triangles incident with v. For an edge e, let t(e) \u2208 {1,2} denote the number of facial triangles incident with e; t(e)=1 iff e is a boundary edge, and t(e)=2 iff e is interior.\\n\\nLemma B (Degree of a face in k(G)). For \u03c4={a,b,c}\u2208T,\\n deg_{kG}(\u03c4) = t(a)+t(b)+t(c) \u2212 t(ab) \u2212 t(bc) \u2212 t(ca).\\nProof. A neighbour of \u03c4 is a facial triangle meeting \u03c4 at a or b or c; triangles through a contribute t(a)\u22121, etc. Those meeting \u03c4 along an edge ab are counted twice; there are exactly t(ab)\u22121 of them (excluding \u03c4). Summing and simplifying yields the formula. \u220e\\n\\nLemma C (Global degree-sum identity). With notation above,\\n \u03a3_{\u03c4\u2208T} deg_{kG}(\u03c4) = \u03a3_{v\u2208V(G)} t(v)^2 \u2212 \u03a3_{e\u2208E(G)} t(e)^2.\\nIn particular, \u03a3_{e} t(e)^2 = 3|T| + 2\u00b7(# interior edges), and for boundary/interior vertices one can rewrite t(v) as deg(v)\u22121 / deg(v), respectively.\\nProof. Sum the formula from Lemma B over all \u03c4. Each \u03c4 contributes t(v) once for each v\u2208\u03c4, so \u03a3_{\u03c4}\u03a3_{v\u2208\u03c4} t(v) = \u03a3_{v} t(v)\u00b7(# triangles containing v)=\u03a3_{v} t(v)^2. Similarly, \u03a3_{\u03c4}\u03a3_{e\u2208\u03c4} t(e) = \u03a3_{e} t(e)\u00b7(# triangles containing e)=\u03a3_{e} t(e)^2. \u220e\\n\\nProposition D (Classification of pairwise-intersecting families). Let F\u2286T be a family of facial triangles in a finite Whitney disc triangulation G such that any two members of F intersect. Then either:\\n- (Star case) there is a vertex v with F\u2286T(v):={\u03c4\u2208T: v\u2208\u03c4}; or\\n- (Wheel-of-four case) there is an interior facial triangle T0 so that F\u2286W(T0):={T0 and its three facial neighbours along the edges of T0}. In particular, if \u22c2F=\u2205, then |F|\u22644 and F\u2286W(T0) for some interior T0; equality |F|=4 occurs iff F=W(T0).\\nProof. If \u22c2F\u2260\u2205, we are in the star case. Suppose \u22c2F=\u2205. Pick any three T1,T2,T3\u2208F. Let their pairwise intersections be vertices v1\u2208T1\u2229T3, v2\u2208T1\u2229T2, v3\u2208T2\u2229T3 (they are distinct, else \u22c2F\u2260\u2205). Since T1 contains v1v2, T2 contains v2v3, and T3 contains v3v1, the 3-cycle v1v2v3 is a triangle of G by the Whitney property; denote it by T0. Consider the planar embedding of G. The union U:=T1\u222aT2\u222aT3 forms the boundary triangle T0 with three disjoint wedge regions U12, U23, U31 outward along edges v1v2, v2v3, v3v1 containing the third vertices of T1,T2,T3, respectively. Any triangle \u03c4 that avoids {v1,v2,v3} and intersects, say, T1 must lie in U12 (its only possible intersection point is the third vertex on that edge). But then \u03c4 cannot simultaneously intersect T2 (it would have to lie in U23) or T3 (in U31), as U12,U23,U31 are pairwise disjoint. Hence any \u03c4\u2208F intersecting all Ti must contain at least two of {v1,v2,v3}. For an edge e\u2208{v1v2,v2v3,v3v1}, exactly two facial triangles contain e; one is the corresponding Ti, and the other is T0. Thus the only triangles containing two of {v1,v2,v3} are the three Ti and T0. Therefore F\u2286{T1,T2,T3,T0}\u2286W(T0), proving the claim. \u220e\\n\\nCorollary E (Clique number bound). For any finite Whitney disc triangulation G, \u03c9(k(G)) \u2264 max{max_v |T(v)|, 4}, and every clique of size \u22654 equals W(T0) for some interior triangle T0.\\n\\nConsequences for k^2(G)\\n\\n- Vertices of k^2(G) correspond to maximal cliques of k(G), which by Proposition D are exactly:\\n  (i) W(T0) for interior faces T0 (size 4), and\\n  (ii) T(v) when it is not strictly contained in any W(T0) (in particular, |T(v)|\u22652, and if v is a corner of some interior T0 with |T(v)|=3 equal to the two edge-neighbours plus T0, then T(v) is not maximal).\\n- Adjacency in k^2(G) can be read off combinatorially:\\n  \u2022 Two star-vertices T(u), T(v) are adjacent iff uv is an edge of G (the intersection consists of the triangle(s) on uv).\\n  \u2022 A star-vertex T(v) is adjacent to a wheel W(T0) iff v is one of the three corners of T0 or the third vertex of one of the three neighbours of T0 (the intersection is the corresponding triangle).\\n  \u2022 Two wheels W(T0), W(T1) are adjacent iff T0 and T1 share an edge (they then share the unique common neighbour triangle along that edge).\\n\\nExamples and checks\\n\\n- Minimal \u201cwheel-of-four\u201d (hexagon with chords 13,35,51): k(G) has a K4 on the four triangles W(T0). Thus k^2(G)\u2245K1 (k-null in two steps). This is a counterexample to the earlier (incorrect) claim that maximal cliques of k(G) are vertex-stars.\\n- Two-triangle disc: k(G)=K2; the unique maximal clique is {both faces} which equals T(v) for the common-edge endpoints v; hence k^2(G)\u2245K1.\\n\\nObstacles\\n\\n- Classifying exactly when a star T(v) is maximal requires a careful case analysis of deg_face(v) and local configurations; deg_face(v)=1 never yields a maximal clique; deg_face(v)=3 at a corner of an interior triangle is contained in a wheel; deg_face(v)=2 can be maximal (e.g., the two-triangle disc), but need not be if extendable by a wheel.\\n- A global monotone potential \u03a6 under G\u21a6k^2(G) for arbitrary disc triangulations remains to be pinned down; Proposition D suggests \u03a6 counting interior faces (wheels) plus the number of maximal stars could work.\\n\\nNext steps\\n\\n1) Formalize the \u201cstar maximality\u201d criterion: necessary and sufficient conditions on the cyclic order of triangles at v ensuring T(v) is maximal in k(G). Prove: T(v) is non-maximal iff either |T(v)|=1, or |T(v)|=3 and v is a corner of an interior face whose three neighbours exhaust T(v).\\n2) From the adjacency rules above, derive a precise description of k^2(G) and prove that the potential \u03a8(G):= (# interior faces) + \u03a3_v max(|T(v)|\u22123,0) strictly decreases under k^2, at least for maximal outerplanar discs; verify on small patches computationally.\\n3) Extend the planarity wedge argument to general closed surfaces to control large cliques in k(G) and to isolate divergence mechanisms for Question 2 (sphere), benchmarking against octahedron/icosahedron.\\n\"}",
