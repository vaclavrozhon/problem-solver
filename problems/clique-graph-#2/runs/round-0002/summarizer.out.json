  "summary_md": "This round corrected counting identities and advanced the structural description of clique dynamics for Whitney triangulations of the disk. Main achievements: proved Whitney-disc graphs are K4-free (so maximal cliques of G are facial triangles); fixed the boundary-aware face-degree formula in kG: deg_{kG}(f)=deg(a)+deg(b)+deg(c)\u22126\u2212B(f)+Eb(f); classified maximal cliques of k(G) for disc triangulations as either vertex-stars P_v or triangle-stars Q_f (the latter shows Helly can fail in general); proved that in the maximal outerplanar (triangulated polygon) subclass Tri(D) is Helly, so maximal cliques are only P_v and k^2(D) \u2245 D[S] with S={v:deg\u22653} (a two-step \u201cear\u2011pruning\u201d yielding k-nullness in many cases, e.g. fans). Remaining work: formalize P/Q adjacency compression into an explicit k^2 operation, produce a monotone two\u2011step potential to prove k\u2011null for all Whitney discs, and run computational checks.

    "Maximal cliques in k(G) are exactly vertex\u2011stars P_v or triangle\u2011stars Q_f (Helly can fail in general due to Q_f).",
    "For maximal outerplanar discs Tri(D) is Helly, so maximal cliques are P_v and k^2(D) \u2245 D[S] with S={v:deg\u22653} (two\u2011step ear pruning).",
    "Consequences: fans are k\u2011null in \u22642 steps; if D[S] is a path P_m then D becomes k\u2011null within \u2264m+1 further steps."
