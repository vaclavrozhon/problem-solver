This round corrected counting identities and advanced the structural description of clique dynamics for Whitney triangulations of the disk. Main achievements: proved Whitney-disc graphs are K4-free (so maximal cliques of G are facial triangles); fixed the boundary-aware face-degree formula in kG: deg_{kG}(f)=deg(a)+deg(b)+deg(c)−6−B(f)+Eb(f); classified maximal cliques of k(G) for disc triangulations as either vertex-stars P_v or triangle-stars Q_f (the latter shows Helly can fail in general); proved that in the maximal outerplanar (triangulated polygon) subclass Tri(D) is Helly, so maximal cliques are only P_v and k^2(D) ≅ D[S] with S={v:deg≥3} (a two-step “ear‑pruning” yielding k-nullness in many cases, e.g. fans). Remaining work: formalize P/Q adjacency compression into an explicit k^2 operation, produce a monotone two‑step potential to prove k‑null for all Whitney discs, and run computational checks.
