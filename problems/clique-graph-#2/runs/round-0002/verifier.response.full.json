Let G be a finite Whitney triangulation of the disc and let f=xyz be an interior facial triangle.

In a plane embedding of the disc triangulation, f bounds a closed 2-cell. Its boundary cycle x\u2013y\u2013z\u2013x separates the plane; since all edges lie on the embedded 1-skeleton and faces are triangles, any vertex adjacent to two of {x,y,z} lies in the wedge beyond the corresponding edge, and no path avoiding {x,y,z} can cross between wedges. Thus removal of {x,y,z} disconnects into exactly three components, one per wedge. \u220e\\n\\nProposition (Maximal cliques in k(G) for Whitney discs). Let G be the underlying graph of a finite Whitney triangulation of the disc.

First, P_v and Q_f are cliques; P_v is clear. For Q_f, any two members intersect (f meets each neighbour along an edge; two distinct neighbours meet at a vertex of f).\\nLet K be a maximal clique. If \u22c2_{T\u2208K}T\u2260\u2205, pick v in the intersection. Then K\u2286P_v and maximality gives K=P_v.\\nAssume \u22c2_{T\u2208K}T=\u2205. We show K=Q_f for some interior face f. We claim no two members of K share an edge. Indeed, if T1 and T2 share edge uv, let their third vertices be c and d. Since the intersection of all members is empty, any T3\u2208K must avoid u and v. To meet T1 and T2, T3 must contain c and d, hence cd is an edge and {u,v,c,d} induces K4, impossible by K4-freeness of Whitney discs. Thus, among any three T1,T2,T3\u2208K, the pairwise intersections are single vertices.\\nChoose T1,T2,T3\u2208K and pick x\u2208(T1\u2229T2)\\\\T3, y\u2208(T2\u2229T3)\\\\T1, z\u2208(T3\u2229T1)\\\\T2.

By the face-separation lemma, G\u2212{x,y,z} splits into three wedge-components U_xy, U_yz, U_zx. The third vertex of Ti lies in the component corresponding to the edge opposite its intersection with the other two. Any triangle \u03c4 avoiding {x,y,z} lies entirely within one component, so it can intersect at most one of T1,T2,T3. Therefore every member of K contains at least two of {x,y,z}. The only facial triangles containing two vertices of {x,y,z} are f and its three edge-neighbours. Hence K\u2286Q_f. If f\u2209K, then K\u222a{f} is still a clique, contradicting maximality; thus f\u2208K. Finally, any triangle outside Q_f contains at most one vertex of {x,y,z} and hence misses one of the edge-neighbours; thus K cannot properly contain Q_f.
