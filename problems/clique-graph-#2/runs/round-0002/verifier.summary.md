We corrected counting identities (boundary-aware deg_k at faces; closed-case sum with −6F) and proved K4-free for Whitney discs. Main advance: a rigorous classification of maximal cliques in k(G) for Whitney disc triangulations—either vertex-stars P_v or triangle-stars Q_f (the 4-clique around an interior face). For maximal outerplanar discs this yields k^2(D)≅D[{deg≥3}] and explicit k-null bounds for zig-zags via line graphs. Remaining tasks: fully formalise P/Q adjacencies in k^2(G), and prove a monotone two-step potential to conclude k-nullness for all Whitney discs. Verdict: uncertain.
