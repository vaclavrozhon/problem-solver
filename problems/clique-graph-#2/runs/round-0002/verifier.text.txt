Prover 2’s Proposition 4 provides a usable proof strategy; the critical step is excluding any pair of triangles sharing an edge within a clique with empty total intersection (else a third triangle forces a K4), and then using the face-separation (3-cut) property of an interior face to confine any such clique to Q_f. I have added a more explicit 3-separator argument in proofs.md to close the topological gap.\n- For maximal outerplanar discs, the specialisation is clean: only P_v occur as maximal cliques, and k^2(D)≅D[S] (S={deg≥3}).

Let G be a finite Whitney triangulation of the disc and let f=xyz be an interior facial triangle. Then G−{x,y,z} has exactly three components, each attached along one of the edges xy, yz, zx; any vertex outside {x,y,z} that lies in a triangle meeting xy (resp. yz, zx) belongs to the corresponding component.\nProof. In a plane embedding of the disc triangulation, f bounds a closed 2-cell. Its boundary cycle x–y–z–x separates the plane; since all edges lie on the embedded 1-skeleton and faces are triangles, any vertex adjacent to two of {x,y,z} lies in the wedge beyond the corresponding edge, and no path avoiding {x,y,z} can cross between wedges. Thus removal of {x,y,z} disconnects into exactly three components, one per wedge. ∎\n\nProposition (Maximal cliques in k(G) for Whitney discs). Let G be the underlying graph of a finite Whitney triangulation of the disc. A clique K in k(G) is maximal if and only if either\n(i) K=P_v := { facial triangles containing v } for some vertex v (vertex-star), or\n(ii) K=Q_f := { f } ∪ { the three facial neighbours of an interior face f } (triangle-star).\nProof. First, P_v and Q_f are cliques; P_v is clear. For Q_f, any two members intersect (f meets each neighbour along an edge; two distinct neighbours meet at a vertex of f).\nLet K be a maximal clique. If ⋂_{T∈K}T≠∅, pick v in the intersection. Then K⊆P_v and maximality gives K=P_v.\nAssume ⋂_{T∈K}T=∅. We show K=Q_f for some interior face f. We claim no two members of K share an edge. Indeed, if T1 and T2 share edge uv, let their third vertices be c and d. Since the intersection of all members is empty, any T3∈K must avoid u and v. To meet T1 and T2, T3 must contain c and d, hence cd is an edge and {u,v,c,d} induces K4, impossible by K4-freeness of Whitney discs. Thus, among any three T1,T2,T3∈K, the pairwise intersections are single vertices.\nChoose T1,T2,T3∈K and pick x∈(T1∩T2)\\T3, y∈(T2∩T3)\\T1, z∈(T3∩T1)\\T2. Then x,y,z are distinct and xz, xy, yz are edges (each pair lies together in one of T1,T2,T3). Hence xyz is a 3-cycle and, by the Whitney property, a face f. By the face-separation lemma, G−{x,y,z} splits into three wedge-components U_xy, U_yz, U_zx. The third vertex of Ti lies in the component corresponding to the edge opposite its intersection with the other two. Any triangle τ avoiding {x,y,z} lies entirely within one component, so it can intersect at most one of T1,T2,T3. Therefore every member of K contains at least two of {x,y,z}. The only facial triangles containing two vertices of {x,y,z} are f and its three edge-neighbours. Hence K⊆Q_f. If f∉K, then K∪{f} is still a clique, contradicting maximality; thus f∈K. Finally, any triangle outside Q_f contains at most one vertex of {x,y,z} and hence misses one of the edge-neighbours; thus K cannot properly contain Q_f. Therefore K=Q_f. ∎\n\nLemma (Global degree-sum identity on discs). Let G be a finite Whitney triangulation of the disc, T its set of faces, and for v an integer t(v)=# of facial triangles incident with v; for an edge e, let t(e)∈{1,2} be the number of facial triangles incident with e. Then\n  Σ_{τ∈T} deg_{kG}(τ) = Σ_{v} t(v)^2 − Σ_{e} t(e)^2.\nProof. For τ={a,b,c}, deg_{kG}(τ)=t(a)+t(b)+t(c) − t(ab) − t(bc) − t(ca). Summing over τ and swapping sums yields Σ_v t(v)·(# faces at v) − Σ_e t(e)·(# faces at e) = Σ_v t(v)^2 − Σ_e t(e)^2. ∎\n\nCorollary (Closed case). If G triangulates a closed surface, then for each face f={a,b,c}, deg_{kG}(f)=deg(a)+deg(b)+deg(c)−6 and Σ_f deg_{kG}(f)=Σ_v deg(v)^2 − 6F, where F is the number of faces. ∎"},"output_update":null}
