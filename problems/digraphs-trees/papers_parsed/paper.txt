Report issue for preceding element Abstract Report issue for preceding element We ask the question, which oriented trees T 𝑇 T italic_T must be contained as subgraphs in every finite directed graph of sufficiently large minimum out-degree. We formulate the following simple condition: all vertices in T 𝑇 T italic_T of in-degree at least 2 2 2 2 must be on the same ‘level’ in the natural height function of T 𝑇 T italic_T . We prove this condition to be necessary and conjecture it to be sufficient. In support of our conjecture, we prove it for a fairly general class of trees. Report issue for preceding element An essential tool in the latter proof, and a question interesting in its own right, is finding large subdivided in-stars in a directed graph of large minimum out-degree. We conjecture that any digraph and oriented graph of minimum out-degree at least k ⁢ ℓ 𝑘 ℓ k\ell italic_k roman_ℓ and k ⁢ ℓ / 2 𝑘 ℓ 2 k\ell/2 italic_k roman_ℓ / 2 , respectively, contains the ( k − 1 ) 𝑘 1 (k-1) ( italic_k - 1 ) -subdivision of the in-star with ℓ ℓ \ell roman_ℓ leaves as a subgraph; this would be tight and generalizes a conjecture of Thomassé. We prove this for digraphs and k = 2 𝑘 2 k=2 italic_k = 2 up to a factor of less than 4 4 4 4 . Report issue for preceding element 1 Introduction Report issue for preceding element One of the main focuses in the study of finite 1 1 1 All digraphs considered in this paper will be finite. For better readability we will keep it implicit. directed graphs has been the investigation of properties of digraphs and oriented graphs of large minimum out-degree. For instance, the famous Caccetta-Häggkvist conjecture&nbsp; [ caccetta1978minimal ] states that every digraph G 𝐺 G italic_G of order n 𝑛 n italic_n with minimum out-degree δ + ⁢ ( G ) ≥ d superscript 𝛿 𝐺 𝑑 \delta^{+}(G)\geq d italic_δ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_G ) ≥ italic_d has a directed cycle of length at most ⌈ n / d ⌉ 𝑛 𝑑 \lceil n/d\rceil ⌈ italic_n / italic_d ⌉ . A conjecture of Thomassé (see&nbsp; [ bang2008digraphs , sullivan2006summary ] ) claims that any oriented graph G 𝐺 G italic_G with δ + ⁢ ( G ) ≥ d superscript 𝛿 𝐺 𝑑 \delta^{+}(G)\geq d italic_δ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_G ) ≥ italic_d contains a directed path of length 2 ⁢ d 2 𝑑 2d 2 italic_d , and recently Cheng and Keevash&nbsp; [ cheng2024length ] , proved a lower bound of 3 ⁢ d / 2 3 𝑑 2 3d/2 3 italic_d / 2 . The Bermond-Thomassen conjecture&nbsp; [ bermond1981cycles ] states that every digraph G 𝐺 G italic_G with δ + ⁢ ( G ) ≥ 2 ⁢ d − 1 superscript 𝛿 𝐺 2 𝑑 1 \delta^{+}(G)\geq 2d-1 italic_δ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_G ) ≥ 2 italic_d - 1 contains d 𝑑 d italic_d disjoint directed cycles. Alon&nbsp; [ alon1996disjoint ] and, more recently, Bucić&nbsp; [ bucic2018improved ] proved it with 2 ⁢ d − 1 2 𝑑 1 2d-1 2 italic_d - 1 replaced by 64 ⁢ d 64 𝑑 64d 64 italic_d and 18 ⁢ d 18 𝑑 18d 18 italic_d , respectively. Report issue for preceding element As quantitative bounds in many of these problems are hard to obtain or sometimes even to guess, it is natural to ask for a property of digraphs if it holds in all digraphs of sufficiently large minimum out-degree. For example, Stiebitz&nbsp; [ stiebitz1996decomposing ] and, independently, Alon&nbsp; [ alon2006splitting ] asked whether for every a , b ≥ 1 𝑎 𝑏 1 a,b\geq 1 italic_a , italic_b ≥ 1 there exists F ⁢ ( a , b ) 𝐹 𝑎 𝑏 F(a,b) italic_F ( italic_a , italic_b ) such that δ + ⁢ ( G ) ≥ F ⁢ ( a , b ) superscript 𝛿 𝐺 𝐹 𝑎 𝑏 \delta^{+}(G)\geq F(a,b) italic_δ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_G ) ≥ italic_F ( italic_a , italic_b ) implies that V ⁢ ( G ) 𝑉 𝐺 V(G) italic_V ( italic_G ) can be partitioned into two non-empty parts A 𝐴 A italic_A and B 𝐵 B italic_B with δ + ⁢ ( G ⁢ [ A ] ) ≥ a superscript 𝛿 𝐺 delimited-[] 𝐴 𝑎 \delta^{+}(G[A])\geq a italic_δ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_G [ italic_A ] ) ≥ italic_a and δ + ⁢ ( G ⁢ [ B ] ) ≥ b superscript 𝛿 𝐺 delimited-[] 𝐵 𝑏 \delta^{+}(G[B])\geq b italic_δ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_G [ italic_B ] ) ≥ italic_b . In a recent breakthrough, Christoph, Petrova and Steiner&nbsp; [ christoph2023note ] reduced this question to that of existence of F ⁢ ( 2 , 2 ) 𝐹 2 2 F(2,2) italic_F ( 2 , 2 ) . Report issue for preceding element Mader&nbsp; [ mader1995exixtence ] conjectured the existence of a function f 𝑓 f italic_f so that δ + ⁢ ( G ) ≥ f ⁢ ( k ) superscript 𝛿 𝐺 𝑓 𝑘 \delta^{+}(G)\geq f(k) italic_δ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_G ) ≥ italic_f ( italic_k ) implies that G 𝐺 G italic_G contains a subdivision of the transitive tournament of order k 𝑘 k italic_k , and proved it for k ≤ 4 𝑘 4 k\leq 4 italic_k ≤ 4 &nbsp; [ Mader1996 ] . This sparked an interest in finding subdivisions of fixed digraphs in digraphs of large out-degree. Aboulker, Cohen, Havet, Lochet, Moura and Thomassé&nbsp; [ aboulker1610subdivisions ] defined a digraph H 𝐻 H italic_H to be δ + superscript 𝛿 \delta^{+} italic_δ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT -maderian if, for some value d 𝑑 d italic_d , every G 𝐺 G italic_G with δ + ⁢ ( G ) ≥ d superscript 𝛿 𝐺 𝑑 \delta^{+}(G)\geq d italic_δ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_G ) ≥ italic_d contains a subdivision of H 𝐻 H italic_H . In this terminology, Mader’s conjecture states that every acyclic digraph is δ + superscript 𝛿 \delta^{+} italic_δ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT -maderian. In support of this, the authors of&nbsp; [ aboulker1610subdivisions ] proved among other results that every in-arborescence (i.e. a tree with all edges oriented towards a designated root vertex) is δ + superscript 𝛿 \delta^{+} italic_δ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT -maderian. They also conjectured that every orientation of a cycle is δ + superscript 𝛿 \delta^{+} italic_δ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT -maderian, and this was recently confirmed by Gishboliner, Steiner and Szabó&nbsp; [ gishboliner2022oriented ] . Report issue for preceding element In this paper we are asking which digraphs H 𝐻 H italic_H must be contained in all digraphs of sufficiently large minimum out-degree as subgraphs . To our surprise, we were not able to find any previous systematic study of the topic, despite the question being natural. Note that orientations of each graph with a cycle can be avoided by taking a 2 ⁢ d 2 𝑑 2d 2 italic_d -regular connected unoriented graph of large girth, and orienting its edges via an Euler circuit. Hence, we may assume that H 𝐻 H italic_H is an orientation of a tree (or a forest, which again reduces to trees). Report issue for preceding element Definition 1.1 . Report issue for preceding element An oriented tree T 𝑇 T italic_T is δ + superscript 𝛿 \delta^{+} italic_δ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT -enforcible if there exists d = d ⁢ ( T ) 𝑑 𝑑 𝑇 d=d(T) italic_d = italic_d ( italic_T ) such that every digraph G 𝐺 G italic_G with δ + ⁢ ( G ) ≥ d superscript 𝛿 𝐺 𝑑 \delta^{+}(G)\geq d italic_δ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_G ) ≥ italic_d contains T 𝑇 T italic_T as a subgraph. Report issue for preceding element A simple greedy embedding certifies that every out-arborescence is δ + superscript 𝛿 \delta^{+} italic_δ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT -enforcible. Much less obviously, by the aforementioned result of Aboulker et al.&nbsp; [ aboulker1610subdivisions ] on in-arborescences, every subdivision of the in-star is δ + superscript 𝛿 \delta^{+} italic_δ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT -enforcible. We remark that it is not true that every in-arborescence is δ + superscript 𝛿 \delta^{+} italic_δ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT -enforcible, as will follow from our Theorem&nbsp; 1.3 . Another known family of δ + superscript 𝛿 \delta^{+} italic_δ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT -enforcible trees are the antidirected trees (that is, trees containing no directed path of length 2 2 2 2 ). By a theorem of Burr&nbsp; [ Burr_1982 ] , δ + ⁢ ( G ) ≥ 4 ⁢ k superscript 𝛿 𝐺 4 𝑘 \delta^{+}(G)\geq 4k italic_δ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_G ) ≥ 4 italic_k implies that G 𝐺 G italic_G contains every antidirected k 𝑘 k italic_k -edge tree as a subgraph. Report issue for preceding element For an oriented tree T 𝑇 T italic_T , its height function h T : V ⁢ ( T ) → ℤ : subscript ℎ 𝑇 → 𝑉 𝑇 ℤ h_{T}\colon V(T)\rightarrow\mathbb{Z} italic_h start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_T end_POSTSUBSCRIPT : italic_V ( italic_T ) → blackboard_Z is a function satisfying h T ⁢ ( v ) = h T ⁢ ( u ) + 1 subscript ℎ 𝑇 𝑣 subscript ℎ 𝑇 𝑢 1 h_{T}(v)=h_{T}(u)+1 italic_h start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_T end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_v ) = italic_h start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_T end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_u ) + 1 for every edge ( u , v ) ∈ E ⁢ ( T ) 𝑢 𝑣 𝐸 𝑇 (u,v)\in E(T) ( italic_u , italic_v ) ∈ italic_E ( italic_T ) . It is clear that the height function is well-defined and unique up to an additive constant. Since we will only care about the relative values of h T subscript ℎ 𝑇 h_{T} italic_h start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_T end_POSTSUBSCRIPT between the vertices of T 𝑇 T italic_T , we will, slightly abusing the notion, speak of “the height function h T subscript ℎ 𝑇 h_{T} italic_h start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_T end_POSTSUBSCRIPT .” Report issue for preceding element Definition 1.2 . Report issue for preceding element An oriented tree T 𝑇 T italic_T is grounded if h T ⁢ ( v ) subscript ℎ 𝑇 𝑣 h_{T}(v) italic_h start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_T end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_v ) is constant for all vertices v 𝑣 v italic_v of in-degree at least 2 2 2 2 . Report issue for preceding element Note that all the above examples of δ + superscript 𝛿 \delta^{+} italic_δ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT -enforcible trees are grounded. We show that they have to be, and conjecture that this is an ‘if and only if’ relationship. Report issue for preceding element Theorem 1.3 . Report issue for preceding element Every δ + superscript 𝛿 \delta^{+} italic_δ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT -enforcible tree is grounded. Report issue for preceding element Conjecture 1.4 (KAMAK tree conjecture 2 2 2 Named after the KAMAK 2024 workshop where the present work was initiated. ) . Report issue for preceding element Every grounded tree is δ + superscript 𝛿 \delta^{+} italic_δ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT -enforcible. Hence, an oriented tree is δ + superscript 𝛿 \delta^{+} italic_δ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT -enforcible if and only if it is grounded. Report issue for preceding element In support of Conjecture&nbsp; 1.4 , we prove it for a fairly general class of trees. Report issue for preceding element Figure 1: An example of a tree with the minimal subtree containing the set U 𝑈 U italic_U that is δ + superscript 𝛿 \delta^{+} italic_δ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT -enforcible by Theorem&nbsp; 1.5 . Report issue for preceding element Theorem 1.5 . Report issue for preceding element Suppose that T 𝑇 T italic_T is grounded and that the minimal subtree of T 𝑇 T italic_T containing the vertex set U = { v ∈ V ⁢ ( T ) : deg − ⁡ ( v ) ≥ 2 } 𝑈 conditional-set 𝑣 𝑉 𝑇 superscript degree 𝑣 2 U=\{v\in V(T):\deg^{-}(v)\geq 2\} italic_U = { italic_v ∈ italic_V ( italic_T ) : roman_deg start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_v ) ≥ 2 } is an out-arborescence. Then T 𝑇 T italic_T is δ + superscript 𝛿 \delta^{+} italic_δ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT -enforcible. Report issue for preceding element Corollary 1.6 . Report issue for preceding element Every grounded tree with at most two vertices of in-degree at least 2 2 2 2 is δ + superscript 𝛿 \delta^{+} italic_δ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT -enforcible. Report issue for preceding element We remark that there has been a considerable body of past and recent work ( [ jackson1981long , kathapurkar2022spanning , KLIMOSOVA2023113515 , penev2025twoblockpathsorientedgraphs , skokan2024alternating ] , see also&nbsp; [ Stein_2024 ] for a survey) on finding oriented trees in digraphs and oriented graphs of large minimum semi-degree δ 0 ⁢ ( G ) superscript 𝛿 0 𝐺 \delta^{0}(G) italic_δ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_G ) , which is the minimum of all in- and out-degrees in G 𝐺 G italic_G . The focus there is different, namely on explicit bounds on δ 0 ⁢ ( G ) superscript 𝛿 0 𝐺 \delta^{0}(G) italic_δ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_G ) , as any fixed oriented tree can be greedily embedded into a digraph of sufficiently large minimum semi-degree. That being said, our last result deals with explicit bounds in the minimum out-degree setting. Report issue for preceding element Let S k , ℓ − subscript superscript 𝑆 𝑘 ℓ S^{-}_{k,\ell} italic_S start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k , roman_ℓ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT be the ( k − 1 ) 𝑘 1 (k-1) ( italic_k - 1 ) -subdivision of the in-star with ℓ ℓ \ell roman_ℓ leaves. An essential tool in our proof of Theorem&nbsp; 1.5 is the existence of S k , ℓ − subscript superscript 𝑆 𝑘 ℓ S^{-}_{k,\ell} italic_S start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k , roman_ℓ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT in digraphs of large minimum out-degree d 𝑑 d italic_d , established in&nbsp; [ aboulker1610subdivisions ] ; an inspection of the proof shows that (in the proof) d 𝑑 d italic_d needs to be at least ℓ k ! superscript ℓ 𝑘 \ell^{k!} roman_ℓ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_k ! end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT . In order to achieve better, perhaps even tight, quantitative bounds in Theorem&nbsp; 1.5 and towards Conjecture&nbsp; 1.4 , it would be desirable to find tight out-degree bounds for the containment of S k , ℓ − subscript superscript 𝑆 𝑘 ℓ S^{-}_{k,\ell} italic_S start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k , roman_ℓ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT . In this regard, we make the following conjecture. Report issue for preceding element Conjecture 1.7 (Giant spider conjecture) .

G = ( V , E ) 𝐺 𝑉 𝐸 G=(V,E) italic_G = ( italic_V , italic_E ) denotes a digraph (directed graph) with the vertex set V 𝑉 V italic_V and edge set E ⊆ { ( u , v ) ∈ V × V : u ≠ v } 𝐸 conditional-set 𝑢 𝑣 𝑉 𝑉 𝑢 𝑣 E\subseteq\{(u,v)\in V\times V:u\neq v\} italic_E ⊆ { ( italic_u , italic_v ) ∈ italic_V × italic_V : italic_u ≠ italic_v } . That is, we do not allow loops and multiple copies of the same edge, but we do allow two edges in opposite directions between a pair of vertices. G 𝐺 G italic_G is an oriented graph if between any two vertices there is at most one edge.

Report issue for preceding element A directed path is an orientation of an undirected path which can be traversed from one end to the other following the orientations of the edges. A subdivision of a digraph G 𝐺 G italic_G introduces some new vertices on the edges of G 𝐺 G italic_G and replaces the edges with directed paths, inheriting the directions. A k 𝑘 k italic_k -subdivision is the subdivision with k 𝑘 k italic_k new vertices for each edge. An oriented tree is an orientation of an undirected tree.

By B k , ℓ + subscript superscript 𝐵 𝑘 ℓ B^{+}_{k,\ell} italic_B start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k , roman_ℓ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT we denote the ℓ ℓ \ell roman_ℓ -branching out-arborescence of depth k 𝑘 k italic_k , i.e. the complete ℓ ℓ \ell roman_ℓ -ary tree of depth (distance from the root to the leaves) k 𝑘 k italic_k oriented away from the root.

Let us assume that U ≠ ∅ 𝑈 U\neq\emptyset italic_U ≠ ∅ , else T 𝑇 T italic_T is trivially grounded. Since T 𝑇 T italic_T is δ + superscript 𝛿 \delta^{+} italic_δ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT -enforcible, there exists d = d ⁢ ( T ) 𝑑 𝑑 𝑇 d=d(T) italic_d = italic_d ( italic_T ) such that every digraph G 𝐺 G italic_G with δ + ⁢ ( G ) ≥ d superscript 𝛿 𝐺 𝑑 \delta^{+}(G)\geq d italic_δ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_G ) ≥ italic_d contains T 𝑇 T italic_T as a subgraph. In particular, G = G 2 ⁢ t , d = ( V , E ) 𝐺 subscript 𝐺 2 𝑡 𝑑 𝑉 𝐸 G=G_{2t,d}=(V,E) italic_G = italic_G start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 italic_t , italic_d end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = ( italic_V , italic_E ) , where t = | V ⁢ ( T ) | 𝑡 𝑉 𝑇 t=\lvert V(T)\rvert italic_t = | italic_V ( italic_T ) | , contains T 𝑇 T italic_T as a subgraph, and let ϕ : T → G : italic-ϕ → 𝑇 𝐺 \phi:T\rightarrow G italic_ϕ : italic_T → italic_G be a witnessing embedding. For each 0 ≤ i ≤ 2 ⁢ t 0 𝑖 2 𝑡 0\leq i\leq 2t 0 ≤ italic_i ≤ 2 italic_t , set L i = { v i , j ∈ V : 1 ≤ j ≤ d i + 1 } subscript 𝐿 𝑖 conditional-set subscript 𝑣 𝑖 𝑗 𝑉 1 𝑗 superscript 𝑑 𝑖 1 L_{i}=\{v_{i,j}\in V\,\colon\,1\leq j\leq d^{i+1}\} italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = { italic_v start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i , italic_j end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ∈ italic_V : 1 ≤ italic_j ≤ italic_d start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_i + 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT } . Report issue for preceding element By Observation&nbsp; 2.2 , a vertex of G 𝐺 G italic_G has in-degree more than 1 1 1 1 if and only if it belongs to L 0 subscript 𝐿 0 L_{0} italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT . Therefore ϕ ⁢ ( U ) ⊆ L 0 italic-ϕ 𝑈 subscript 𝐿 0 \phi(U)\subseteq L_{0} italic_ϕ ( italic_U ) ⊆ italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , and in particular, ϕ ⁢ ( T ) ∩ L 0 ≠ ∅ italic-ϕ 𝑇 subscript 𝐿 0 \phi(T)\cap L_{0}\neq\emptyset italic_ϕ ( italic_T ) ∩ italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ≠ ∅ . This implies ϕ ⁢ ( T ) ∩ L t = ∅ italic-ϕ 𝑇 subscript 𝐿 𝑡 \phi(T)\cap L_{t}=\emptyset italic_ϕ ( italic_T ) ∩ italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = ∅ , as t = | V ⁢ ( T ) | 𝑡 𝑉 𝑇 t=\lvert V(T)\rvert italic_t = | italic_V ( italic_T ) | and the edges in G 𝐺 G italic_G are between L i subscript 𝐿 𝑖 L_{i} italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and L i + 1 subscript 𝐿 𝑖 1 L_{i+1} italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i + 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT modulo 2 ⁢ t + 1 2 𝑡 1 2t+1 2 italic_t + 1 .

Hence, T 𝑇 T italic_T is grounded. ∎ Report issue for preceding element 3 A new family of δ + superscript 𝛿 \delta^{+} italic_δ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT -enforcible trees Report issue for preceding element In this section we prove Theorem&nbsp; 1.5 . Let T 𝑇 T italic_T be a tree satisfying the assumptions of Theorem&nbsp; 1.5 , and let T ∗ superscript 𝑇 T^{*} italic_T start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∗ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT be its subtree obtained by iteratively removing leaves of in-degree 1 1 1 1 until none remain. Note that every vertex of T ∗ superscript 𝑇 T^{*} italic_T start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∗ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT has the same in-degree in T ∗ superscript 𝑇 T^{*} italic_T start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∗ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT as in T 𝑇 T italic_T , in particular, U ⁢ ( T ∗ ) = U ⁢ ( T ) 𝑈 superscript 𝑇 𝑈 𝑇 U(T^{*})=U(T) italic_U ( italic_T start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∗ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) = italic_U ( italic_T ) . Hence, T ∗ superscript 𝑇 T^{*} italic_T start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∗ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT satisfies the assumptions of Theorem&nbsp; 1.5 . On the other hand, if T ∗ superscript 𝑇 T^{*} italic_T start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∗ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT is δ + superscript 𝛿 \delta^{+} italic_δ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT -enforcible then so is T 𝑇 T italic_T , by a greedy embedding. Thus it suffices to prove that T ∗ superscript 𝑇 T^{*} italic_T start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∗ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT is δ + superscript 𝛿 \delta^{+} italic_δ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT -enforcible. Furthermore, if | U ⁢ ( T ) | = | U ⁢ ( T ∗ ) | = 0 𝑈 𝑇 𝑈 superscript 𝑇 0 \lvert U(T)\rvert=\lvert U(T^{*})\rvert=0 | italic_U ( italic_T ) | = | italic_U ( italic_T start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∗ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) | = 0 , then T ∗ superscript 𝑇 T^{*} italic_T start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∗ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT is a single vertex, which is trivially δ + superscript 𝛿 \delta^{+} italic_δ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT -enforcible, and if | U ⁢ ( T ) | = | U ⁢ ( T ∗ ) | = 1 𝑈 𝑇 𝑈 superscript 𝑇 1 \lvert U(T)\rvert=\lvert U(T^{*})\rvert=1 | italic_U ( italic_T ) | = | italic_U ( italic_T start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∗ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) | = 1 , then T ∗ superscript 𝑇 T^{*} italic_T start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∗ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT is a subdivision of an in-star, which is also δ + superscript 𝛿 \delta^{+} italic_δ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT -enforcible, as was shown in&nbsp; [ aboulker1610subdivisions ] (see Proposition&nbsp; 3.2 below). Hence, relabelling, we may assume that T 𝑇 T italic_T does not have any leaf of in-degree 1 1 1 1 and that U = U ⁢ ( T ) 𝑈 𝑈 𝑇 U=U(T) italic_U = italic_U ( italic_T ) is of size at least 2 2 2 2 . Report issue for preceding element Let T ′ superscript 𝑇 ′ T^{\prime} italic_T start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT be the minimal subtree of T 𝑇 T italic_T containing U 𝑈 U italic_U . By our assumption, T ′ superscript 𝑇 ′ T^{\prime} italic_T start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT is an out-arborescence, and let r 𝑟 r italic_r be its root vertex. Since | U | ≥ 2 𝑈 2 |U|\geq 2 | italic_U | ≥ 2 and T 𝑇 T italic_T is grounded we have r ∉ U 𝑟 𝑈 r\notin U italic_r ∉ italic_U . Moreover, since T 𝑇 T italic_T is grounded and h T subscript ℎ 𝑇 h_{T} italic_h start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_T end_POSTSUBSCRIPT must extend h T ′ subscript ℎ superscript 𝑇 ′ h_{T^{\prime}} italic_h start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_T start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , the latter must be constant on the vertices of U 𝑈 U italic_U . By the minimality of T ′ superscript 𝑇 ′ T^{\prime} italic_T start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , U 𝑈 U italic_U must be the set of leaves of T ′ superscript 𝑇 ′ T^{\prime} italic_T start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT .

Moreover, it has deg + ⁡ ( v ) ≤ 1 superscript degree 𝑣 1 \deg^{+}(v)\leq 1 roman_deg start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_v ) ≤ 1 , as otherwise T 𝑇 T italic_T would contain a leaf of in-degree 1 1 1 1 . Therefore, T ∖ T ′ 𝑇 superscript 𝑇 ′ T\setminus T^{\prime} italic_T ∖ italic_T start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT is a collection of vertex disjoint paths ℱ ℱ \mathcal{F} caligraphic_F , each of which is directed towards T ′ superscript 𝑇 ′ T^{\prime} italic_T start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT .

Moreover, the former holds for at most one path P r ∈ ℱ subscript 𝑃 𝑟 ℱ P_{r}\in\mathcal{F} italic_P start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_r end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ∈ caligraphic_F .
