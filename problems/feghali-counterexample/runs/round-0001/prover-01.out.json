  "content": "Ideas\n- We can force the conflict graph G (vertices E; x\u2013y edge if \u2203 p\u2260q with f_p(x)=f_q(y)) to be complete while keeping the hypothesis parameter n* = max_z min_t |f_t^{-1}(z)| equal to 1. Then any bound of the form \u03c7(G) \u2264 c(k) n* must satisfy c(k) \u2265 \u03c7(G), yielding the strongest possible lower bound on c(k) from n*=1 instances. We also want this construction to remain valid under natural strengthenings (e.g., many indices at each z having small fibres).\n- Finite projective planes supply exactly such instances, and they are optimal for n*=1: they give \u03c7(G)=k^2\u2212k+1 with n*=1, and one cannot make \u03c7(G) larger in an n*=1 instance.\n\nConstruction (projective plane, n*=1, complete G)\n- Let q be a prime power and set k:=q+1. Let F be the set of points and E the set of lines in the projective plane PG(2,q). Then |E|=|F|=q^2+q+1=k^2\u2212k+1. Each line has exactly k points; each point lies on exactly k lines; any two lines meet in exactly one point.\n- Consider the incidence bipartite graph B with parts F and E. It is k-regular on both sides, hence has a proper k-edge-coloring by K\u0151nig\u2019s line-coloring theorem. For each i\u2208[k], define f_i(L) to be the unique point z\u2208L such that the incidence edge (z,L) is colored i.\n- Check:\n  1) Pointwise distinctness: for each line L, the k incident edges have pairwise distinct colors, hence the values f_1(L),\u2026,f_k(L) are distinct.\n  2) Fibre sizes: for each point z and color i, there is exactly one line L through z whose incidence edge has color i; hence |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all z,i. Therefore n* = max_z min_i |f_i^{-1}(z)| = 1.\n  3) Completeness of G: let L\u2260M be lines. They meet at a unique point z. At z, the two incidences (z,L),(z,M) receive distinct colors p\u2260q (proper edge-coloring). Thus f_p(L)=z=f_q(M) with p\u2260q, so L and M are adjacent. Hence G is complete on |E|=k^2\u2212k+1 vertices.\n- Consequence: \u03c7(G)=|E|=k^2\u2212k+1 while n*=1. This is a very strong counterexample: the \u201c2n+1\u201d target equals 3, but one needs k^2\u2212k+1 parts. It also satisfies the much stronger fibre condition \u201cfor every z and every i, |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1\u201d.\n\nOptimality for n*=1\n- Claim. For any instance with k functions, pointwise distinct outputs, n*=1, and complete conflict graph, one has |E| \u2264 k^2\u2212k+1; hence \u03c7(G) \u2264 k^2\u2212k+1.\n- Proof. Let m:=|E|. For x\u2208E write S_x={f_i(x): i\u2208[k]}, so |S_x|=k. Completeness implies S_x\u2229S_y\u2260\u2205 for all x\u2260y. For z\u2208F, let d(z):=|{x\u2208E: z\u2208S_x}|. If two distinct x,y both contain z, they must use different indices at z; otherwise their unique witness of equality at z would be via the same index, giving no edge. Thus d(z) \u2264 k. Count pairs in two ways: every unordered pair {x,y} intersects in at least one z, so C(m,2) \u2264 \u2211_{z} C(d(z),2) \u2264 |F|\u00b7C(k,2). Also incidences give mk = \u2211_{z} d(z) \u2264 k|F|, hence |F| \u2265 m. Therefore C(m,2) \u2264 m\u00b7C(k,2), i.e., (m\u22121)/2 \u2264 k(k\u22121)/2, so m \u2264 k^2\u2212k+1. Equality holds in the projective plane construction. \u220e\n- Thus for n*=1 the bound \u03c7(G) \u2264 (k^2\u2212k+1) is best possible, and any universal linear bound \u03c7(G) \u2264 c(k)\u00b7n* must satisfy c(k) \u2265 k^2\u2212k+1.\n\nExamples\n- k=3 (Fano plane): |E|=7, n*=1, G=K_7. Required parts: 7 > 2n+1=3. This is a tiny, explicit, very strong counterexample.\n- General k: for any k, pick a prime power q\u2264k\u22121 and set k\u2032=q+1. Use PG(2,q) to obtain |E|=q^2+q+1 \u2265 \u03a9(k^2). Pad to k functions by giving each extra index a fresh value per x; this preserves pointwise distinctness, keeps n*=1, and keeps G complete. Hence for all k, we obtain \u03c7(G) \u2265 c\u00b7k^2 with n*=1.\n- Comparison: the permutation construction (E=S_k, f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i)) gives \u03c7(G)=k! and n*=(k\u22121)!, so \u03c7/n*=k. The projective-plane family yields \u03c7/n*=k^2\u2212k+1, strengthening the lower bound on any c(k) from k to k^2\u2212k+1.\n\nWhy useful here\n- Disproves the hoped-for \u201c2n+1\u201d partition for k\u22653 in the strongest way: already for n=1 one needs \u0398(k^2) parts.\n- Robust to weaker/stronger hypotheses: it satisfies even the stronger requirement that all k fibres at each z have size 1, so it defeats natural strengthenings of the hypothesis.\n\nObstacles and limits\n- Existence is guaranteed when k\u22121 is a prime power (projective planes PG(2,q)). For general k, padding with dummy indices preserves n*=1 and completeness, giving |E| \u2273 k^2 up to constant factors (by Bertrand\u2019s postulate choose a prime p\u2208(k/2,k]).\n- The upper bound m \u2264 k^2\u2212k+1 shows this family is optimal for n*=1: no n*=1 instance can force \u03c7(G) larger than k^2\u2212k+1.\n\nNext steps\n- Seek analogous near-optimal constructions for general n>1 achieving \u03c7(G) \u2273 (k^2\u2212k+1)\u00b7n while keeping n* = n. This likely requires \u201clayered\u201d designs with controlled colour-multiplicities per z and pairwise-distinguishing labels across layers.\n- Investigate universal upper bounds of the form \u03c7(G) \u2264 C(k)\u00b7n. The n*=1 extremal bound suggests C(k) \u2265 k^2\u2212k+1 is necessary; can one prove \u03c7(G) \u2264 (k^2\u2212k+1)\u00b7n always? If true, it would be tight up to equality at n=1.\n- Record small explicit instances (e.g., k=3,7 lines) for notes.md; they are easy for the verifier to check."
