You are a research mathematician. 

You are being run in a loop with a verifier that checks rigor. Your goal is to make **incremental, auditable progress**. You are not expected to solve the problem at once, but to generate new, testable ideas.

Inputs: 
- task statement 
- notes.md (informal progress & exploratory work; optional) 
- proofs.md (rigorously proven results & detailed proofs; optional) 
- output.md (main results summary only; optional) 
- summary of past rounds (optional) 
- possibly some reference papers.

What counts as progress:
- Extract small lemmas/heuristics from literature and state them cleanly with one-line "why useful here".
- Explore small examples & try to break your own claims with toy counterexamples.
- Prove special cases or nontrivial bounds.
- If an approach fails, explain crisply why.
- Point out flaws in notes.md, proofs.md, or output.md (but do not rewrite these files yourself).

**Discipline.** 
- Read notes, outputs, summaries carefully before proposing new work. 
- Reference papers if relevant, but focus on *incremental, checkable steps*. 
- Do not output Markdown code fences, only raw JSON. 
- Length: at least ~200 words. 
- Organize your reasoning with short headings (Ideas, Examples, Obstacles, Next steps), make clear what your claims are and how they are supported. 
- Remember: the verifier curates notes and outputs, you only suggest.

**Output**: Write your analysis as Markdown that includes both informal reasoning and any rigorous proofs. The verifier will decide what goes into notes.md, proofs.md, and output.md.

**Return strictly JSON**:
{
  "content": "Your complete analysis in Markdown (KaTeX allowed). Include reasoning, examples, proofs, failed attempts, intuitions - everything for the verifier to review."

Try to find as strong as possible counterexample to the following question: 

Problem 1. A function theoretic problem, with possible applications to digraphs (suggested by Carl Feghali) Statement and Motivation: Consider two functions f and g from a set E into a set F such that f(x) 6= g(x) for every x ∈ E . Suppose that there exists a positive integer n such that for any element z in F either |f −1 (z)| ≤ n or |g −1 (z)| ≤ n. It was shown in [2] that E can be partitioned into 2n + 1 subsets E1, E2, . . . , , E2n+1 such that f(Ei) ∩ g(Ei) = ∅ for each 1 ≤ i ≤ 2n + 1. This result has nice applications in digraphs, and a short proof was later given in [1]. Question: Is it possible to generalise the above to any number of functions? More specifically, consider functions f1, . . . , fk from a set E into a set F such that fi(x) 6= fj (x) for every x ∈ E and 1 ≤ i < j ≤ k. Suppose that there exists a positive integer n such that for any element z in F, there exists an integer t ∈ {1, . . . , k} such that |f −1 t (z)| ≤ n. Is it true that E can be partitioned into 2n + 1 subsets of E1, . . . , E2n+1 such that fp(Ei) ∩ fq(Ei) = ∅ for each 1 ≤ i ≤ 2n + 1 and 1 ≤ p < q ≤ k?

Attached is a simple counterexample, but perhaps there are stronger ones that also apply to natural weaker variants of the question.

\title{A Sharp Linear Lower Bound in the Multi-Function Partition Problem}
\author{}
\date{}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We consider $k\ge2$ functions $f_1,\dots,f_k:E\to F$ with pointwise distinct outputs and the associated \emph{conflict graph} $G$ on $E$, where $xy$ is an edge iff there exist $p\ne q$ with $f_p(x)=f_q(y)$. Let
\[
n^{*} \;:=\; \max_{z\in F}\ \min_{t\in[k]} |f_t^{-1}(z)|
\]
be the intrinsic fibre parameter. We prove that any general linear upper bound of the form
$\chi(G)\le c(k)\,n^{*}$ (valid for all such instances with $k$ functions) must satisfy $c(k)\ge k$ for every $k\ge2$.
The proof uses a permutation construction with $\chi(G)=k!$ and $n^{*}=(k-1)!$.
\end{abstract}

\section{Setup}
Let $k\ge2$ and $f_1,\dots,f_k:E\to F$ satisfy \emph{pointwise distinctness}:
\[
\forall x\in E,\ \ \text{the values } f_1(x),\dots,f_k(x)\ \text{are pairwise distinct}.
\]
Define the \emph{conflict graph} $G$ on vertex set $E$ by joining distinct $x,y\in E$ whenever
\begin{equation}\label{eq:conflict}
\exists\, p\ne q\in[k]\ \ \text{such that}\ \ f_p(x)=f_q(y).
\end{equation}
A partition $E=\bigsqcup_i E_i$ has the property that $f_p(E_i)\cap f_q(E_i)=\varnothing$ for all $p\ne q$ if and only if each $E_i$ is a stable set in $G$; hence the minimum number of parts equals $\chi(G)$.

We measure the ``size'' of fibres by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:nstar}
n^{*} \;:=\; \max_{z\in F}\ \min_{t\in[k]} |f_t^{-1}(z)|,
\end{equation}
the smallest integer $n$ for which the hypothesis ``$\forall z\ \exists t$ with $|f_t^{-1}(z)|\le n$'' holds.

\section{A permutation construction}
Let $E=S_k$ be the set of all permutations of $[k]=\{1,\dots,k\}$, take $F=[k]$, and define
\begin{equation}\label{eq:perm}
f_i(\pi)\ :=\ \pi(i)\qquad(\pi\in S_k,\ i\in[k]).
\end{equation}
Pointwise distinctness holds since $\{\pi(1),\dots,\pi(k)\}=[k]$ for each $\pi$.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:complete}
For the instance \eqref{eq:perm}, the conflict graph $G$ is complete on $|E|=k!$ vertices.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $\pi\ne\sigma\in S_k$. Choose a symbol $s\in[k]$ such that $\pi^{-1}(s)\ne\sigma^{-1}(s)$ (some symbol moves position).
Then with $p:=\pi^{-1}(s)$ and $q:=\sigma^{-1}(s)$ we have $p\ne q$ and
\[
f_p(\pi)=\pi(p)=s=\sigma(q)=f_q(\sigma).
\]
By \eqref{eq:conflict}, $\pi$ and $\sigma$ are adjacent. Hence every pair is adjacent and $G$ is complete.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:nstar}
For the instance \eqref{eq:perm}, for every $z\in[k]$ and $i\in[k]$ the fibre size $|f_i^{-1}(z)|=(k-1)!$. Consequently $n^*=(k-1)!$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Fix $i$ and $z$. The constraint $f_i(\pi)=z$ is $\pi(i)=z$. The remaining $k-1$ positions can be permuted arbitrarily, giving $(k-1)!$ permutations. For fixed $z$, the minimum of $|f_i^{-1}(z)|$ over $i$ is therefore $(k-1)!$, and taking the maximum over $z$ yields $n^{*}=(k-1)!$.
\end{proof}

Combining Lemmas~\ref{lem:complete} and \ref{lem:nstar} we obtain
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ratio}
\chi(G) \ =\ k!\ =\ k\cdot (k-1)!\ =\ k\,n^{*} .
\end{equation}

\section{Main lower bound}
\begin{theorem}[Sharp linear lower bound]\label{thm:ck}
Let $c:\{2,3,\dots\}\to\mathbb{R}_{\ge0}$ be any function with the property that \emph{for every} instance of $k$ functions as above, the associated conflict graph $G$ satisfies
\[
\chi(G)\ \le\ c(k)\,n^{*}.
\]
Then necessarily $c(k)\ge k$ for every $k\ge2$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Apply the assumed bound to the permutation instance \eqref{eq:perm}. By \eqref{eq:ratio} we have $\chi(G)=k\,n^{*}$, hence
\[
k\,n^{*} \ =\ \chi(G)\ \le\ c(k)\,n^{*}.
\]
Since $n^{*}>0$, it follows that $c(k)\ge k$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
The proof is purely extremal and shows that the linear coefficient in any universal bound of the form $\chi(G)\le c(k)\,n^{*}$ cannot be smaller than $k$. In particular, no bound independent of $k$ is possible, and any attempt to use a constant $<k$ fails already on the permutation family.
\end{remark}
