  "content": "Ideas\n- Use the permutation template f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i) on E\u2286S_k to keep the conflict graph complete (so the minimum number of parts equals |E|), but prune E to drive the intrinsic fibre parameter n* down to a small constant (even 1). This yields very strong counterexamples to any bound of the form \u201c2n+1 parts suffice\u201d and, more generally, to any linear-in-n bound with coefficient depending only on k.\n- Generalise the pruning via forbidden positions to obtain strong counterexamples even under stronger hypotheses where each z enjoys small fibres in r distinct functions.\n\nSetup and notation\n- As in the attached paper, define the conflict graph G on E by joining x\u2260y iff \u2203p\u2260q with f_p(x)=f_q(y). A partition into classes E_i with f_p(E_i)\u2229f_q(E_i)=\u2205 for all p<q is exactly a proper coloring of G; the least number of parts equals \u03c7(G).\n- Let n*:=max_{z\u2208F} min_{t\u2208[k]} |f_t^{-1}(z)| (the smallest n for which the hypothesis holds).\n\nConstruction A (n*=1 but \u03c7\u2248k!)\n- Fix k\u22653. Take F=[k]. For i\u2208[k] and \u03c0\u2208S_k, set f_i(\u03c0):=\u03c0(i). This satisfies pointwise distinctness.\n- Let \u03c4 be any permutation of [k]; by conjugation invariance we may w.l.o.g. take \u03c4=id to simplify exposition (the general \u03c4 is equivalent by renaming coordinates). Define\n  E_0 := {\u03c0\u2208S_k : \u03c0 has no fixed points} (the derangements), |E_0|=D_k.\n  For each s\u2208[k], choose a permutation \u03c0^s with exactly one fixed point, namely \u03c0^s(s)=s and \u03c0^s(t)\u2260t for all t\u2260s (there are D_{k-1} choices for each s). Let E_1 := {\u03c0^s : s\u2208[k]}. Set E := E_0 \u222a E_1.\n- Fibres: For z=s, choose t=s. Then f_s^{-1}(s) = {\u03c0\u2208E : \u03c0(s)=s} has size 1 (the unique \u03c0^s), so min_t |f_t^{-1}(s)|=1. Hence n*=1.\n- Completeness: For any distinct \u03c0,\u03c3\u2208E and any symbol s with \u03c0^{-1}(s)\u2260\u03c3^{-1}(s), setting p:=\u03c0^{-1}(s) and q:=\u03c3^{-1}(s) gives p\u2260q and f_p(\u03c0)=s=f_q(\u03c3); thus G is complete on E. Therefore \u03c7(G)=|E|=|E_0|+|E_1|=D_k+k.\n- Consequences:\n  \u2022 For k=3, D_3=2, so \u03c7=5 while 2n*+1=3; this already refutes the proposed bound.\n  \u2022 For general k, \u03c7(G)=D_k+k\u223c(1/e)k! grows factorially while n*=1. Hence there cannot exist any universal bound \u03c7(G)\u2264c(k)\u00b7n* with subfactorial c(k); necessarily c(k)\u2265(D_k+k)/n*\u2248(1/e)k!.\n\nConstruction B (general n with exact control)\n- With the same F and f_i, for any integer n with 1\u2264n\u2264D_{k-1}, choose, for each s\u2208[k], a set E_s of n permutations, each having exactly one fixed point at s and no others. Let E_n := E_0 \u222a (\u22c3_{s} E_s). Then for each s, |f_s^{-1}(s)|=n and hence n*=n. The conflict graph on E_n remains complete, so \u03c7(G)=|E_n|=D_k + n k.\n- This shows that for every fixed n, taking k sufficiently large (so that D_{k-1}\u2265n) yields \u03c7(G)\u2248(1/e)k! despite n*=n. In particular, no bound of the form \u03c7(G)\u2264c(k)\u00b7n with subfactorial c(k) can hold.\n\nA stronger negative under a \u201cweaker\u201d variant (many small fibres per z)\n- Variant: For some fixed r\u22651, assume a stronger hypothesis that for every z\u2208F there are at least r distinct indices t_1,\u2026,t_r with |f_{t_j}^{-1}(z)|\u2264n. We can still force \u03c7 to be factorial in k.\n- Construction: Pick r permutations \u03c4_1,\u2026,\u03c4_r of [k]. Let E_0(r):={\u03c0\u2208S_k : for all j and all s, \u03c0(\u03c4_j(s))\u2260s}. By a change of coordinates this is the set of permutations avoiding the r disjoint perfect matchings of forbidden cells; inclusion\u2013exclusion/rook polynomials give |E_0(r)|=(e^{-r}+o(1))k! as k\u2192\u221e. For each s and each j, add n permutations \u03c0^{(s,j)} with exactly one \u201c\u03c4_j-fixed point\u201d (i.e., \u03c0\u2218\u03c4_j fixes s and no other element) and no \u03c4_{j'}-fixed points for j'\u2260j. Let E:=E_0(r) \u222a \u22c3_{s,j}{\u03c0^{(s,j)}}. Then for each z=s there are r indices t_j:=\u03c4_j(s) with |f_{t_j}^{-1}(s)|=n, yet the conflict graph on E is complete, so \u03c7(G)\u2265|E_0(r)|+rnk\u2265(e^{-r}+o(1))k!.\n- Hence even under the stronger assumption \u201cat least r functions have small fibre for each z\u201d, any bound depending only on n (or even on n and r) fails drastically.\n\nWhy these are useful here\n- They directly refute the proposed generalisation to k\u22653: even with n*=1 one needs \u2273k! parts, not 2n+1=3.\n- They strengthen the lower bound in the attached paper from c(k)\u2265k to c(k)\u2265\u0398(k!), for any putative inequality \u03c7(G)\u2264c(k)\u00b7n* valid for all instances.\n\nSmall explicit example (k=3, n*=1)\n- E_0={ (1 2 3), (1 3 2) }. E_1={ (2 3), (1 3), (1 2) }. With f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i):\n  \u2022 For s=1, only (2 3) contributes to f_1^{-1}(1); similarly for s=2 and s=3.\n  \u2022 G is K_5, so 5 parts are necessary, contradicting 2n*+1=3.\n\nObstacles/Checks\n- Quantifier in the hypothesis is existential in n; taking the minimal n* is the strongest reading. Our constructions achieve exact n* (1 or any n\u2264D_{k-1}).\n- Completeness of G is preserved for any E\u2286S_k under f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i), ensuring the chromatic number equals |E|.\n\nNext steps\n- Formalise and record in proofs: (i) exact counts |E_0(r)| via rook polynomials; (ii) the existence and count of permutations with prescribed set of fixed points for \u03c1=\u03c0\u2218\u03c4_j. Both are standard (|{\u03c1 with exactly one fixed point}|=k\u00b7D_{k-1}).\n- Explore tight trade-offs: For fixed k and given n, what is max |E| subject to n*\u2264n? Our constructions give |E|\u2265D_k+nk; upper bounds in this regime would further clarify optimality.\n- Test small k,n computationally to verify counts and independence condition, and to benchmark \u03c7(G) vs n*.\n"
