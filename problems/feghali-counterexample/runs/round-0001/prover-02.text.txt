Ideas
- Use the permutation template f_i(π)=π(i) on E⊆S_k to keep the conflict graph complete (so the minimum number of parts equals |E|), but prune E to drive the intrinsic fibre parameter n* down to a small constant (even 1). This yields very strong counterexamples to any bound of the form “2n+1 parts suffice” and, more generally, to any linear-in-n bound with coefficient depending only on k.
- Generalise the pruning via forbidden positions to obtain strong counterexamples even under stronger hypotheses where each z enjoys small fibres in r distinct functions.

Setup and notation
- As in the attached paper, define the conflict graph G on E by joining x≠y iff ∃p≠q with f_p(x)=f_q(y). A partition into classes E_i with f_p(E_i)∩f_q(E_i)=∅ for all p<q is exactly a proper coloring of G; the least number of parts equals χ(G).
- Let n*:=max_{z∈F} min_{t∈[k]} |f_t^{-1}(z)| (the smallest n for which the hypothesis holds).

Construction A (n*=1 but χ≈k!)
- Fix k≥3. Take F=[k]. For i∈[k] and π∈S_k, set f_i(π):=π(i). This satisfies pointwise distinctness.
- Let τ be any permutation of [k]; by conjugation invariance we may w.l.o.g. take τ=id to simplify exposition (the general τ is equivalent by renaming coordinates). Define
  E_0 := {π∈S_k : π has no fixed points} (the derangements), |E_0|=D_k.
  For each s∈[k], choose a permutation π^s with exactly one fixed point, namely π^s(s)=s and π^s(t)≠t for all t≠s (there are D_{k-1} choices for each s). Let E_1 := {π^s : s∈[k]}. Set E := E_0 ∪ E_1.
- Fibres: For z=s, choose t=s. Then f_s^{-1}(s) = {π∈E : π(s)=s} has size 1 (the unique π^s), so min_t |f_t^{-1}(s)|=1. Hence n*=1.
- Completeness: For any distinct π,σ∈E and any symbol s with π^{-1}(s)≠σ^{-1}(s), setting p:=π^{-1}(s) and q:=σ^{-1}(s) gives p≠q and f_p(π)=s=f_q(σ); thus G is complete on E. Therefore χ(G)=|E|=|E_0|+|E_1|=D_k+k.
- Consequences:
  • For k=3, D_3=2, so χ=5 while 2n*+1=3; this already refutes the proposed bound.
  • For general k, χ(G)=D_k+k∼(1/e)k! grows factorially while n*=1. Hence there cannot exist any universal bound χ(G)≤c(k)·n* with subfactorial c(k); necessarily c(k)≥(D_k+k)/n*≈(1/e)k!.

Construction B (general n with exact control)
- With the same F and f_i, for any integer n with 1≤n≤D_{k-1}, choose, for each s∈[k], a set E_s of n permutations, each having exactly one fixed point at s and no others. Let E_n := E_0 ∪ (⋃_{s} E_s). Then for each s, |f_s^{-1}(s)|=n and hence n*=n. The conflict graph on E_n remains complete, so χ(G)=|E_n|=D_k + n k.
- This shows that for every fixed n, taking k sufficiently large (so that D_{k-1}≥n) yields χ(G)≈(1/e)k! despite n*=n. In particular, no bound of the form χ(G)≤c(k)·n with subfactorial c(k) can hold.

A stronger negative under a “weaker” variant (many small fibres per z)
- Variant: For some fixed r≥1, assume a stronger hypothesis that for every z∈F there are at least r distinct indices t_1,…,t_r with |f_{t_j}^{-1}(z)|≤n. We can still force χ to be factorial in k.
- Construction: Pick r permutations τ_1,…,τ_r of [k]. Let E_0(r):={π∈S_k : for all j and all s, π(τ_j(s))≠s}. By a change of coordinates this is the set of permutations avoiding the r disjoint perfect matchings of forbidden cells; inclusion–exclusion/rook polynomials give |E_0(r)|=(e^{-r}+o(1))k! as k→∞. For each s and each j, add n permutations π^{(s,j)} with exactly one “τ_j-fixed point” (i.e., π∘τ_j fixes s and no other element) and no τ_{j'}-fixed points for j'≠j. Let E:=E_0(r) ∪ ⋃_{s,j}{π^{(s,j)}}. Then for each z=s there are r indices t_j:=τ_j(s) with |f_{t_j}^{-1}(s)|=n, yet the conflict graph on E is complete, so χ(G)≥|E_0(r)|+rnk≥(e^{-r}+o(1))k!.
- Hence even under the stronger assumption “at least r functions have small fibre for each z”, any bound depending only on n (or even on n and r) fails drastically.

Why these are useful here
- They directly refute the proposed generalisation to k≥3: even with n*=1 one needs ≳k! parts, not 2n+1=3.
- They strengthen the lower bound in the attached paper from c(k)≥k to c(k)≥Θ(k!), for any putative inequality χ(G)≤c(k)·n* valid for all instances.

Small explicit example (k=3, n*=1)
- E_0={ (1 2 3), (1 3 2) }. E_1={ (2 3), (1 3), (1 2) }. With f_i(π)=π(i):
  • For s=1, only (2 3) contributes to f_1^{-1}(1); similarly for s=2 and s=3.
  • G is K_5, so 5 parts are necessary, contradicting 2n*+1=3.

Obstacles/Checks
- Quantifier in the hypothesis is existential in n; taking the minimal n* is the strongest reading. Our constructions achieve exact n* (1 or any n≤D_{k-1}).
- Completeness of G is preserved for any E⊆S_k under f_i(π)=π(i), ensuring the chromatic number equals |E|.

Next steps
- Formalise and record in proofs: (i) exact counts |E_0(r)| via rook polynomials; (ii) the existence and count of permutations with prescribed set of fixed points for ρ=π∘τ_j. Both are standard (|{ρ with exactly one fixed point}|=k·D_{k-1}).
- Explore tight trade-offs: For fixed k and given n, what is max |E| subject to n*≤n? Our constructions give |E|≥D_k+nk; upper bounds in this regime would further clarify optimality.
- Test small k,n computationally to verify counts and independence condition, and to benchmark χ(G) vs n*.
