  "content": "Ideas\n- Use the conflict-graph viewpoint: vertices are E, and an edge xy exists if \u2203 p\u2260q with f_p(x)=f_q(y). A partition into parts E_i with f_p(E_i)\u2229f_q(E_i)=\u2205 for all p<q is exactly a proper coloring of this graph.\n- Strengthen the known permutation construction by injecting \u201clight\u201d functions whose images are disjoint from the \u201cheavy\u201d functions, to force n=1 (or even many small fibres per z) while keeping the conflict graph complete.\n\nA very strong counterexample with n=1 (k\u22654)\nLet k\u22654. Put m:=k-1 and r:=1. Take E=S_m and F= [m] \u2294 B, where B is a set in bijection with S_m (to be specified). Define m \u201cheavy\u201d functions h_i:E\u2192[m] by h_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i) for i\u2208[m], and one \u201clight\u201d function \u2113:E\u2192B by \u2113(\u03c0)=b_\u03c0 (a distinct element of B for each \u03c0).\n- Pointwise distinctness: For each \u03c0, the values h_1(\u03c0),\u2026,h_m(\u03c0) are the distinct elements of [m], and \u2113(\u03c0)\u2208B disjoint from [m], so all k values are distinct.\n- Small fibres with n=1: For any z\u2208[m], \u2113^{-1}(z)=\u2205, so min_t |f_t^{-1}(z)|=0\u22641. For any z=b_\u03c0\u2208B we have \u2113^{-1}(z)={\u03c0}, so again \u22641.\n- Completeness of the conflict graph: For any distinct \u03c0,\u03c3\u2208S_m there exists s\u2208[m] with \u03c0^{-1}(s)\u2260\u03c3^{-1}(s). Let p:=\u03c0^{-1}(s) and q:=\u03c3^{-1}(s). Then h_p(\u03c0)=s=h_q(\u03c3), hence \u03c0\u03c3 is an edge. Thus the conflict graph is K_{|E|}=K_{m!}.\nConsequently \u03c7=|E|=m!=(k-1)!, so more than 2n+1=3 parts are needed for all k\u22654. This refutes the 2n+1 bound in the strongest possible way: already with n=1 and even with one function injective (\u2113), the required number of parts is factorial in k.\n\nA family handling \u201cmany small fibres per z\u201d (robust to weaker variants)\nFix k\u22653, integers r with 1\u2264r\u2264k-2, and set m:=k-r. Let E=S_m. Take pairwise disjoint sets B_1,\u2026,B_r, each in bijection with S_m, and set F=[m] \u2294 B_1 \u2294 \u2026 \u2294 B_r. Define heavy functions h_i:E\u2192[m] by h_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i) for i=1,\u2026,m, and light functions \u2113_j:E\u2192B_j by \u2113_j(\u03c0)=b^{(j)}_\u03c0 for j=1,\u2026,r.\n- Pointwise distinctness holds as before.\n- For every z\u2208F, at least r functions have fibre size \u22641: \n  \u2022 If z\u2208[m], then \u2113_1^{-1}(z)=\u2026=\u2113_r^{-1}(z)=\u2205, so r functions have fibre 0.\n  \u2022 If z\u2208B_j, then all heavy functions have fibre 0 at z, and all light functions \u2113_{j\u2019} with j\u2019\u2260j have fibre 0; in fact k\u22121 functions have fibre 0 and \u2113_j has fibre 1.\nThus for n=1 the property \u201cfor every z there exist at least s functions with |f_t^{-1}(z)|\u22641\u201d holds for any s\u2264r.\n- The conflict graph remains complete on |E|=m! by the same permutation argument (it uses only the heavy functions), so \u03c7(E)=m!=(k\u2212r)!.\nConsequences:\n- Even under the strictly stronger hypothesis \u201cfor each z at least s functions (s\u2264r) have fibres \u22641\u201d, the required number of parts can be (k\u2212s)!; in particular no bound of the form C(k,s)\u00b7n+O(1) with subfactorial C(k,s) can hold in general when n=1.\n- This also shows failure under the natural strengthening \u201cthere exists a fixed t with |f_t^{-1}(z)|\u22641 for all z\u201d (i.e., one injective function), by taking r\u22651.\n\nRelation to the n* parameter\nLet n*:=max_{z} min_{t} |f_t^{-1}(z)|. In the above constructions, n*=0 (since some function avoids every z), so linear bounds in n* alone are vacuous for these families. The earlier permutation-only instance has n*=(k\u22121)! and \u03c7=k\u00b7n*, showing any universal inequality \u03c7\u2264c(k)\u00b7n* must have c(k)\u2265k. Our \u201clight+heavy\u201d instances complement this by showing that controlling n (even n=1) without preventing zero-fibres is far too weak.\n\nExamples\n- k=4, r=1, m=3: E=S_3, |E|=6. Need \u03c7=6>3=2n+1. One light (injective) function suffices to force n=1.\n- General k\u22654 with r=1 gives \u03c7=(k\u22121)! against n=1.\n- General k and any s\u2264k\u22122: pick r=s to ensure \u201c\u2265s small fibres per z\u201d; then \u03c7=(k\u2212s)! with n=1.\n\nObstacles and remarks\n- For k=3, the m=2 construction yields |E|=2\u22643, so it does not disprove the 2n+1 bound. A dedicated k=3 counterexample with n small and \u03c7>3 would require a different design; worth exploring separately.\n- If one forbids \u201ccheating by zeros\u201d by requiring every z lie in the image of every function, then n*\u22651 and the permutation-only instance shows \u03c7\u2265k\u00b7n*. Whether stronger impossibility results persist under such surjective constraints across all k functions is an interesting next step.\n\nNext steps\n- Seek k=3 counterexamples with n as small as possible and \u03c7>2n+1.\n- Investigate constraints like \u201cevery z appears in at least t functions\u201d (t\u22652) and quantify the minimal number of parts; our heavy+light family already gives \u03c7=(k\u2212t)! with n=1 when t\u2264k\u22121.\n- Explore whether completeness with m heavy functions is best possible (is |E|\u2264m! necessary for completeness under pointwise distinctness?). Proving such a cap would clarify optimality.\n"
