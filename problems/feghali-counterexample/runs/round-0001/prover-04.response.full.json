Then a partition with f_p(E_i)\u2229f_q(E_i)=\u2205 for all p<q is exactly a proper coloring; the minimum number of parts equals \u03c7(G).\\n- Use the permutation template: take F=[k], E\u2286S_k, and define f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i). This enforces pointwise distinctness automatically. Crucial fact: for any distinct \u03c0,\u03c3\u2208S_k there is a symbol s with \u03c0^{-1}(s)\u2260\u03c3^{-1}(s), hence f_{\u03c0^{-1}(s)}(\u03c0)=s=f_{\u03c3^{-1}(s)}(\u03c3) with different indices, so the conflict graph on E is complete. Thus \u03c7(G)=|E| for any E\u2286S_k.\\n\\nMain counterexample (n=1, complete graph, huge \u03c7)\\nProposition (derangement family). Fix k\u22654. Let E be the set D_k of derangements of [k] (no fixed points), let F=[k], and define f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i).\\n- Hypothesis with n=1 holds in a stronger form: for each z\u2208F, taking t=z gives f_z^{-1}(z)=\u2205 (so |f_t^{-1}(z)|=0\u22641).\\n- The conflict graph is complete (by the permutation argument above), so \u03c7(G)=|E|=|D_k|=!k\u2248k!/e.\\nConclusion: With n=1 we need \u2248k!/e colors; in particular the bound 2n+1=3 fails dramatically for all k\u22654. This also defeats any variant where the hypothesis is strengthened to allow f_t^{-1}(z)=\u2205.\\n\\nSmall-k illustration. For k=4: |D_4|=9, n=1, \u03c7(G)=9>3. For k=5: |D_5|=44, n=1, \u03c7(G)=44>3.\\n\\nA tuned family for arbitrary n (still complete graphs)\\nFix k\u22653. For each z\u2208[k], let S_z be any subset of permutations with exactly one fixed point at z (and no other fixed points), of size at most n.

The hypothesis holds.\\n- The conflict graph on E is complete, hence \u03c7(G)=|E|=|D_k|+\u2211_z|S_z|=!k + kn.\\nRemarks: For each z there are exactly !(k\u22121) permutations with exactly one fixed point at z, so we can realize any n\u2264!(k\u22121). This shows that even for small n (e.g., n fixed while k\u2192\u221e) we need \u03c7(G) growing like !k.\\n\\nA tight k=3 instance\\nLet k=3, E=S_3, F=[3], f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i).\\n- For any i and z, |f_i^{-1}(z)|=2, hence the hypothesis holds with n=2.\\n- The conflict graph is complete, so \u03c7(G)=6>2n+1=5. Thus the k=3 case already falsifies the 2n+1 bound (with n=2). For n=1, the permutation template gives at most |E|=|D_3|=2 (or 3 if adding the identity), so no violation with n=1 here; whether there exists a non-permutation n=1 counterexample for k=3 remains open (worth a targeted search).\\n\\nImplications for \u201cweaker variants\u201d\\n- Any linear upper bound \u03c7(G)\u2264c(k)\u00b7n must have c(k)\u2265k (per the attached permutation instance). The derangement family with n=1 further implies that any bound of the form \u03c7(G)\u2264c(k)n+b(k) forces b(k)\u2265!k\u2212c(k), i.e., the additive term must grow at least factorially in k. So no bound of the form O_k(n)+poly(k) can hold.\\n- Because these conflict graphs are complete, the same lower bounds apply to list-chromatic, DP-chromatic, and fractional chromatic numbers.\\n\\nWhy these are \u201cstrong\u201d\\n- They violate the conjectured 2n+1 bound at the extreme n=1 and even under the stronger hypothesis \u201cfor each z some f_t omits z entirely.\u201d\\n- They force any universal linear-in-n bound to have both coefficient and additive term large (coefficient \u2265k; additive term \u2265!k\u2212c(k)).\\n\\nObstacles and checks\\n- For k=3, achieving n=1 with \u03c7\u22654 via the permutation template seems impossible; a systematic computer search over general functions (small F) could resolve existence.\\n- For the tuned family, picking S_z with exactly one fixed point at z ensures the sets S_z are disjoint across z; hence |E|=!k+kn is exact for any n\u2264!(k\u22121).\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Compute/verify maximal \u03c7 for k=3 under n=1 by exhaustive search (small F) to see if a counterexample exists or a positive result holds in this corner case.\\n- Explore requiring \u201cfor each z, at least r indices have |f_t^{-1}(z)|\u2264n.\u201d Can one keep \u03c7 superlinear for small r\u22652?
