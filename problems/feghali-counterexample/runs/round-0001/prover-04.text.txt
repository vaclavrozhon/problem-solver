Ideas
- Work in the conflict-graph formulation: vertices are elements of E; x,y are adjacent iff ∃ p≠q with f_p(x)=f_q(y). Then a partition with f_p(E_i)∩f_q(E_i)=∅ for all p<q is exactly a proper coloring; the minimum number of parts equals χ(G).
- Use the permutation template: take F=[k], E⊆S_k, and define f_i(π)=π(i). This enforces pointwise distinctness automatically. Crucial fact: for any distinct π,σ∈S_k there is a symbol s with π^{-1}(s)≠σ^{-1}(s), hence f_{π^{-1}(s)}(π)=s=f_{σ^{-1}(s)}(σ) with different indices, so the conflict graph on E is complete. Thus χ(G)=|E| for any E⊆S_k.

Main counterexample (n=1, complete graph, huge χ)
Proposition (derangement family). Fix k≥4. Let E be the set D_k of derangements of [k] (no fixed points), let F=[k], and define f_i(π)=π(i).
- Hypothesis with n=1 holds in a stronger form: for each z∈F, taking t=z gives f_z^{-1}(z)=∅ (so |f_t^{-1}(z)|=0≤1).
- The conflict graph is complete (by the permutation argument above), so χ(G)=|E|=|D_k|=!k≈k!/e.
Conclusion: With n=1 we need ≈k!/e colors; in particular the bound 2n+1=3 fails dramatically for all k≥4. This also defeats any variant where the hypothesis is strengthened to allow f_t^{-1}(z)=∅.

Small-k illustration. For k=4: |D_4|=9, n=1, χ(G)=9>3. For k=5: |D_5|=44, n=1, χ(G)=44>3.

A tuned family for arbitrary n (still complete graphs)
Fix k≥3. For each z∈[k], let S_z be any subset of permutations with exactly one fixed point at z (and no other fixed points), of size at most n. Set
E := D_k ∪ ⋃_{z=1}^k S_z and f_i(π)=π(i).
- For each z, choose t=z. Then f_z^{-1}(z)=S_z, so |f_z^{-1}(z)|≤n. The hypothesis holds.
- The conflict graph on E is complete, hence χ(G)=|E|=|D_k|+∑_z|S_z|=!k + kn.
Remarks: For each z there are exactly !(k−1) permutations with exactly one fixed point at z, so we can realize any n≤!(k−1). This shows that even for small n (e.g., n fixed while k→∞) we need χ(G) growing like !k.

A tight k=3 instance
Let k=3, E=S_3, F=[3], f_i(π)=π(i).
- For any i and z, |f_i^{-1}(z)|=2, hence the hypothesis holds with n=2.
- The conflict graph is complete, so χ(G)=6>2n+1=5. Thus the k=3 case already falsifies the 2n+1 bound (with n=2). For n=1, the permutation template gives at most |E|=|D_3|=2 (or 3 if adding the identity), so no violation with n=1 here; whether there exists a non-permutation n=1 counterexample for k=3 remains open (worth a targeted search).

Implications for “weaker variants”
- Any linear upper bound χ(G)≤c(k)·n must have c(k)≥k (per the attached permutation instance). The derangement family with n=1 further implies that any bound of the form χ(G)≤c(k)n+b(k) forces b(k)≥!k−c(k), i.e., the additive term must grow at least factorially in k. So no bound of the form O_k(n)+poly(k) can hold.
- Because these conflict graphs are complete, the same lower bounds apply to list-chromatic, DP-chromatic, and fractional chromatic numbers.

Why these are “strong”
- They violate the conjectured 2n+1 bound at the extreme n=1 and even under the stronger hypothesis “for each z some f_t omits z entirely.”
- They force any universal linear-in-n bound to have both coefficient and additive term large (coefficient ≥k; additive term ≥!k−c(k)).

Obstacles and checks
- For k=3, achieving n=1 with χ≥4 via the permutation template seems impossible; a systematic computer search over general functions (small F) could resolve existence.
- For the tuned family, picking S_z with exactly one fixed point at z ensures the sets S_z are disjoint across z; hence |E|=!k+kn is exact for any n≤!(k−1).

Next steps
- Compute/verify maximal χ for k=3 under n=1 by exhaustive search (small F) to see if a counterexample exists or a positive result holds in this corner case.
- Explore requiring “for each z, at least r indices have |f_t^{-1}(z)|≤n.” Can one keep χ superlinear for small r≥2? A natural test-bed is permutations constrained to have few specified fixed points.
- If applications demand extra structure (e.g., each f_i surjective; or fibres near-uniform), derangement-based constructions can be adapted by balanced sampling from S_k while preserving f_z^{-1}(z) small for designated z.
