  "summary_md": "This round produced strong counterexamples to the multi-function partition conjecture by viewing valid partitions as colorings of the conflict graph G (edge x\u2013y iff \u2203 p\u2260q with f_p(x)=f_q(y)). Two main families were developed: (1) Permutation template f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i) on E=S_k gives G complete, n*=(k-1)!, and \u03c7=k!, so \u03c7 = k\u00b7n*; hence any universal linear bound \u03c7 \u2264 c(k)n* must have c(k) \u2265 k (see paper1). (2) Projective-plane construction for k=q+1 yields |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all i,z but G complete on k^2\u2212k+1 vertices, so n*=1 yet \u03c7 is quadratic in k. An explicit small example k=3,n=1 produces K5. Constructions with prescribed n using derangements were also given.",
