Try to find as strong as possible counterexample to the following question: 

Problem 1. A function theoretic problem, with possible applications to digraphs (suggested by Carl Feghali) Statement and Motivation: Consider two functions f and g from a set E into a set F such that f(x) 6= g(x) for every x ∈ E . Suppose that there exists a positive integer n such that for any element z in F either |f −1 (z)| ≤ n or |g −1 (z)| ≤ n. It was shown in [2] that E can be partitioned into 2n + 1 subsets E1, E2, . . . , , E2n+1 such that f(Ei) ∩ g(Ei) = ∅ for each 1 ≤ i ≤ 2n + 1. This result has nice applications in digraphs, and a short proof was later given in [1]. Question: Is it possible to generalise the above to any number of functions? More specifically, consider functions f1, . . . , fk from a set E into a set F such that fi(x) 6= fj (x) for every x ∈ E and 1 ≤ i < j ≤ k. Suppose that there exists a positive integer n such that for any element z in F, there exists an integer t ∈ {1, . . . , k} such that |f −1 t (z)| ≤ n. Is it true that E can be partitioned into 2n + 1 subsets of E1, . . . , E2n+1 such that fp(Ei) ∩ fq(Ei) = ∅ for each 1 ≤ i ≤ 2n + 1 and 1 ≤ p < q ≤ k?

Attached is a simple counterexample, but perhaps there are stronger ones that also apply to natural weaker variants of the question.

# Research Notes



Counterexample families and conflict-graph view

- Conflict graph G: vertices E; edge x–y iff ∃ p≠q with f_p(x)=f_q(y). A valid partition equals a proper coloring; #parts = χ(G).

Permutation-based counterexamples (very strong)
- Template: k functions on E⊆S_k, F=[k], f_i(π)=π(i). For any distinct π,σ∈E there exists s with π^{-1}(s)≠σ^{-1}(s), yielding an edge. Hence G is complete for any E⊆S_k.
- Take E = D_k (derangements) ∪ (for each s∈[k], pick n permutations that fix s and no other point). Then for z=s, choose t=s: f_s^{-1}(s) has size n. Therefore n* = n. G is complete, so χ(G)=|E|=|D_k|+kn. For n=1 this is ≈ k!/e + k.
- Small explicit case k=3, n=1: E = {(1 2 3),(1 3 2)} ∪ {(2 3),(1 3),(1 2)}. Then χ(G)=5 while 2n+1=3.
- Variant (informal): For r≥1, by forbidding r disjoint perfect matchings of cells one can pick a large set E_0(r) with |E_0(r)|≈e^{-r}k!, and still ensure that for each z there are ≥ r indices whose fibres at z have size ≤ n after adding nk more permutations. Completeness persists. Rigor via rook polynomials to be written.

Projective-plane counterexamples (robust under strong fibre constraints)
- For k=q+1 (q a prime power): E = lines, F = points in PG(2,q). Proper k-edge-color the incidence bipartite graph; for i∈[k], define f_i(L) to be the point incident to L via color i. Then for all z and i, |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1. Any two lines meet in one point z and receive distinct colors there, so G is complete on |E|=k^2−k+1. Thus n*=1 yet χ(E)=k^2−k+1 > 2n+1.

Caveat / correction
- A proposed general upper bound m≤k^2−k+1 for n*=1 and complete G is false; permutation-based n*=1 examples give m≈k!/e. The mistaken step was assuming that among vertices containing a given z the indices used at z must be distinct; completeness does not force this at a fixed z.

Takeaways
- The permutation family shows that, even with n*=1, χ can be factorial in k; the projective-plane family shows robustness when all fibres are forced to be size 1 simultaneously.
- Next: formalize the r≥1 variant counts; explore upper bounds under added regularity (e.g., all f_i surjective or balanced fibre sizes).

# Main Results



Counterexamples to the k-function partition conjecture
- For every k≥3 and every integer n with 1≤n≤D_{k-1}, there exist functions f_1,…,f_k:E→[k] with pointwise distinct outputs and parameter n*=n such that the associated conflict graph is complete with χ(G)=|E|=D_k+kn. In particular, for k=3 and n=1 one gets χ=5>2n+1=3.
- For infinitely many k (k=q+1 with q a prime power), there exist functions with the stronger property |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all z and all i, yet the conflict graph is complete on k^2−k+1 vertices, so χ(G)=k^2−k+1>2·1+1.
These show the proposed bound 2n+1 fails dramatically for k≥3, even when n=1 and under strong fibre-regularity conditions.


=== Verifier Summary ===

Validated two strong counterexample families. 1) Permutation-based: for k≥3 and any 1≤n≤D_{k−1}, set E=derangements ∪ (nk permutations each fixing a prescribed symbol), define f_i(π)=π(i). Then n*=n, G is complete, and χ(G)=|D_k|+kn (k=3 yields K5 with n*=1). 2) Projective-plane: for k=q+1, define f_i via a k-edge-coloring of the incidence graph; all fibres equal 1 and G=K_{k^2−k+1}. A claimed upper bound m≤k^2−k+1 for n*=1 complete graphs is false (contradicted by the permutation family). Proofs for (1) and (2) appended; further work: rigorous counts for the “≥r small fibres per z” variant and exploring bounds under added regularity (e.g., surjectivity/balanced fibres).

# Rigorous Proofs



Setup and notation
Let k≥3. Given functions f_1,…,f_k:E→F with pointwise distinct outputs, define the conflict graph G on E by joining x≠y if ∃ p≠q with f_p(x)=f_q(y).
For a set of functions, define n*:=max_{z∈F} min_{t∈[k]} |f_t^{-1}(z)|.

Lemma 1 (Permutation template yields complete G).
Let F=[k], let E⊆S_k, and define f_i(π)=π(i). Then the conflict graph on E is complete.
Proof. For π≠σ∈E, the permutations π^{-1} and σ^{-1} differ, so choose s with π^{-1}(s)≠σ^{-1}(s). Set p:=π^{-1}(s) and q:=σ^{-1}(s). Then p≠q and f_p(π)=π(p)=s=σ(q)=f_q(σ), so π and σ are adjacent. ∎

Theorem 2 (Strong counterexamples with prescribed n).
Fix k≥3 and an integer n with 1≤n≤D_{k-1} (where D_m is the number of derangements of [m]). There exist functions f_1,…,f_k:E→[k] with pointwise distinct outputs such that n*=n and the conflict graph is complete with
χ(G)=|E|=D_k + kn.
Proof. Let E_0 be the set of derangements of [k], |E_0|=D_k. For each s∈[k], choose a set E_s of n permutations that fix s and have no other fixed points; this is possible since there are D_{k-1} such permutations for each s. Define E:=E_0 ∪ (⋃_{s=1}^k E_s) and f_i(π):=π(i).
Pointwise distinctness holds because each π is a permutation. For each z=s, consider t=s. Then f_s^{-1}(s)=E_s, so |f_s^{-1}(s)|=n, hence min_{t}|f_t^{-1}(s)|≤n. Taking max over s gives n*≤n, while clearly n*≥n since for each s we have |f_s^{-1}(s)|=n. Thus n*=n. By Lemma 1 the conflict graph on E is complete, so χ(G)=|E|=D_k+kn. ∎

Corollary 3 (Explicit k=3, n=1 counterexample).
For k=3, take E_0={(1 2 3),(1 3 2)} and E_1={ (2 3), (1 3), (1 2) }. With f_i(π)=π(i), we have n*=1 and G=K_5, so 5 parts are needed although 2n*+1=3.

Theorem 4 (Projective-plane family: all fibres size 1 and complete G).
Let q be a prime power and set k:=q+1. Let PG(2,q) have point set F and line set E, each of size q^2+q+1=k^2−k+1. Consider the incidence bipartite graph between F and E (each vertex has degree k). Properly edge-color this bipartite k-regular graph with k colors (by Kőnig’s line-coloring theorem). For i∈[k] and L∈E define f_i(L) to be the unique point z∈F such that the incidence edge (z,L) has color i.
Then for every z∈F and every i we have |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1, and for any distinct L,M∈E, the conflict graph has L adjacent to M. Consequently G is complete on |E|=k^2−k+1 vertices and χ(G)=k^2−k+1 with n*=1.
Proof. At each vertex the k incident edges receive distinct colors among [k], so for fixed z and i there is exactly one L with color i at (z,L), giving |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1. For distinct lines L≠M, they meet in a unique point z; the two edges (z,L) and (z,M) receive distinct colors p≠q, hence f_p(L)=z=f_q(M), so L and M are adjacent. ∎

\title{A Sharp Linear Lower Bound in the Multi-Function Partition Problem}
\author{}
\date{}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We consider $k\ge2$ functions $f_1,\dots,f_k:E\to F$ with pointwise distinct outputs and the associated \emph{conflict graph} $G$ on $E$, where $xy$ is an edge iff there exist $p\ne q$ with $f_p(x)=f_q(y)$. Let
\[
n^{*} \;:=\; \max_{z\in F}\ \min_{t\in[k]} |f_t^{-1}(z)|
\]
be the intrinsic fibre parameter. We prove that any general linear upper bound of the form
$\chi(G)\le c(k)\,n^{*}$ (valid for all such instances with $k$ functions) must satisfy $c(k)\ge k$ for every $k\ge2$.
The proof uses a permutation construction with $\chi(G)=k!$ and $n^{*}=(k-1)!$.
\end{abstract}

\section{Setup}
Let $k\ge2$ and $f_1,\dots,f_k:E\to F$ satisfy \emph{pointwise distinctness}:
\[
\forall x\in E,\ \ \text{the values } f_1(x),\dots,f_k(x)\ \text{are pairwise distinct}.
\]
Define the \emph{conflict graph} $G$ on vertex set $E$ by joining distinct $x,y\in E$ whenever
\begin{equation}\label{eq:conflict}
\exists\, p\ne q\in[k]\ \ \text{such that}\ \ f_p(x)=f_q(y).
\end{equation}
A partition $E=\bigsqcup_i E_i$ has the property that $f_p(E_i)\cap f_q(E_i)=\varnothing$ for all $p\ne q$ if and only if each $E_i$ is a stable set in $G$; hence the minimum number of parts equals $\chi(G)$.

We measure the ``size'' of fibres by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:nstar}
n^{*} \;:=\; \max_{z\in F}\ \min_{t\in[k]} |f_t^{-1}(z)|,
\end{equation}
the smallest integer $n$ for which the hypothesis ``$\forall z\ \exists t$ with $|f_t^{-1}(z)|\le n$'' holds.

\section{A permutation construction}
Let $E=S_k$ be the set of all permutations of $[k]=\{1,\dots,k\}$, take $F=[k]$, and define
\begin{equation}\label{eq:perm}
f_i(\pi)\ :=\ \pi(i)\qquad(\pi\in S_k,\ i\in[k]).
\end{equation}
Pointwise distinctness holds since $\{\pi(1),\dots,\pi(k)\}=[k]$ for each $\pi$.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:complete}
For the instance \eqref{eq:perm}, the conflict graph $G$ is complete on $|E|=k!$ vertices.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $\pi\ne\sigma\in S_k$. Choose a symbol $s\in[k]$ such that $\pi^{-1}(s)\ne\sigma^{-1}(s)$ (some symbol moves position).
Then with $p:=\pi^{-1}(s)$ and $q:=\sigma^{-1}(s)$ we have $p\ne q$ and
\[
f_p(\pi)=\pi(p)=s=\sigma(q)=f_q(\sigma).
\]
By \eqref{eq:conflict}, $\pi$ and $\sigma$ are adjacent. Hence every pair is adjacent and $G$ is complete.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:nstar}
For the instance \eqref{eq:perm}, for every $z\in[k]$ and $i\in[k]$ the fibre size $|f_i^{-1}(z)|=(k-1)!$. Consequently $n^*=(k-1)!$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Fix $i$ and $z$. The constraint $f_i(\pi)=z$ is $\pi(i)=z$. The remaining $k-1$ positions can be permuted arbitrarily, giving $(k-1)!$ permutations. For fixed $z$, the minimum of $|f_i^{-1}(z)|$ over $i$ is therefore $(k-1)!$, and taking the maximum over $z$ yields $n^{*}=(k-1)!$.
\end{proof}

Combining Lemmas~\ref{lem:complete} and \ref{lem:nstar} we obtain
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ratio}
\chi(G) \ =\ k!\ =\ k\cdot (k-1)!\ =\ k\,n^{*} .
\end{equation}

\section{Main lower bound}
\begin{theorem}[Sharp linear lower bound]\label{thm:ck}
Let $c:\{2,3,\dots\}\to\mathbb{R}_{\ge0}$ be any function with the property that \emph{for every} instance of $k$ functions as above, the associated conflict graph $G$ satisfies
\[
\chi(G)\ \le\ c(k)\,n^{*}.
\]
Then necessarily $c(k)\ge k$ for every $k\ge2$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Apply the assumed bound to the permutation instance \eqref{eq:perm}. By \eqref{eq:ratio} we have $\chi(G)=k\,n^{*}$, hence
\[
k\,n^{*} \ =\ \chi(G)\ \le\ c(k)\,n^{*}.
\]
Since $n^{*}>0$, it follows that $c(k)\ge k$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
The proof is purely extremal and shows that the linear coefficient in any universal bound of the form $\chi(G)\le c(k)\,n^{*}$ cannot be smaller than $k$. In particular, no bound independent of $k$ is possible, and any attempt to use a constant $<k$ fails already on the permutation family.
\end{remark}
