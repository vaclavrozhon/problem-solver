This round produced strong counterexamples to the multi-function partition conjecture by viewing valid partitions as colorings of the conflict graph G (edge x–y iff ∃ p≠q with f_p(x)=f_q(y)). Two main families were developed: (1) Permutation template f_i(π)=π(i) on E=S_k gives G complete, n*=(k-1)!, and χ=k!, so χ = k·n*; hence any universal linear bound χ ≤ c(k)n* must have c(k) ≥ k (see paper1). (2) Projective-plane construction for k=q+1 yields |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all i,z but G complete on k^2−k+1 vertices, so n*=1 yet χ is quadratic in k. An explicit small example k=3,n=1 produces K5. Constructions with prescribed n using derangements were also given.
