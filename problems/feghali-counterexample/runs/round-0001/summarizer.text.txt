{"summary_md":"This round produced strong counterexamples to the multi-function partition conjecture by viewing valid partitions as colorings of the conflict graph G (edge x–y iff ∃ p≠q with f_p(x)=f_q(y)). Two main families were developed: (1) Permutation template f_i(π)=π(i) on E=S_k gives G complete, n*=(k-1)!, and χ=k!, so χ = k·n*; hence any universal linear bound χ ≤ c(k)n* must have c(k) ≥ k (see paper1). (2) Projective-plane construction for k=q+1 yields |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all i,z but G complete on k^2−k+1 vertices, so n*=1 yet χ is quadratic in k. An explicit small example k=3,n=1 produces K5. Constructions with prescribed n using derangements were also given.","highlights":["Conflict graph formulation: valid partition ↔ proper coloring, so needed parts = χ(G).","Permutation template (E⊆S_k, f_i(π)=π(i)) yields complete G, n*=(k-1)!, χ=k!, so χ=k·n* and forces c(k)≥k for any linear bound χ≤c(k)n*.","Derangement-based variants give complete G with prescribed n: E = derangements ∪ (for each symbol s pick n permutations fixing s) → χ = D_k + k n.","Projective-plane family (k=q+1) yields |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all i,z but G complete on k^2−k+1 vertices, so n*=1 yet χ≫2n+1.","Explicit small counterexample: k=3, n=1 gives K5 (χ=5) while 2n+1=3, so the 2n+1 bound fails already for k=3."],"next_questions":["Formalize the ‘r≥1 small-fibres-per-z’ permutation-family counts (e.g. via rook polynomials) to quantify how large χ can be for given restrictions.","Investigate upper bounds under added regularity hypotheses (e.g. all f_i surjective, balanced fiber sizes, or other combinatorial constraints).","Determine minimal structural hypotheses on the f_i that restore a subfactorial/linear bound on χ(G).
