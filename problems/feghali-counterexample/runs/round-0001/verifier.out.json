  "feedback_md": "Overall, there is substantial, correct progress with two complementary families of counterexamples: (i) permutation-based instances yielding complete conflict graphs with factorial chromatic number while keeping n*=1; (ii) projective-plane instances achieving n*=1 with the much stronger property that all fibres are size 1 across all indices, still forcing a complete graph of size ~k^2.\n\nKey correctness points\n- The conflict-graph viewpoint is correct: a partition with fp(Ei)\u2229fq(Ei)=\u2205 corresponds to a proper coloring of G.\n- For the permutation template f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i) on any E\u2286S_k, the conflict graph is indeed complete: for \u03c0\u2260\u03c3 pick s with \u03c0^{-1}(s)\u2260\u03c3^{-1}(s); then f_{\u03c0^{-1}(s)}(\u03c0)=s=f_{\u03c3^{-1}(s)}(\u03c3) with different indices.\n- Prover 2\u2019s constructions are valid: taking E=derangements D_k together with, for each s\u2208[k], one permutation fixing s (and no other point), gives n*=1 and \u03c7(G)=|D_k|+k, with G complete. The generalization to any 1\u2264n\u2264D_{k-1} with \u03c7=|D_k|+kn is also correct.\n- Prover 4\u2019s statements mirror Prover 2 and are sound, including the explicit k=3 example yielding K5 with n*=1.\n- Prover 1\u2019s projective-plane construction is correct and valuable: for k=q+1 there exist functions with |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all z,i and G=K_{k^2\u2212k+1}.\n\nCritical issue\n- Prover 1\u2019s \u201cOptimality for n*=1\u201d upper bound m\u2264k^2\u2212k+1 for complete G is false. It is contradicted by the permutation-based family with n*=1 and m=|D_k|+k\u226bk^2 for k\u22655. The flaw is the claim that among vertices x with z\u2208S_x the indices \u201cused at z\u201d must be all distinct; completeness does not force this at a fixed z.\n\nStrength against variants\n- The permutation family gives \u03c7 \u2248 k!/e with n*=1, i.e., no bound of the form \u03c7\u2264c(k)\u00b7n with subfactorial c(k) can hold. The projective-plane family shows robustness under much stronger fibre conditions (all fibres = 1), still forcing \u0398(k^2) parts.\n\nNext steps\n- Formalize and include rigorous proofs for: (a) \u03c7=|D_k|+kn with n*=n; (b) projective-plane construction. Done in proofs.md.\n- For the \u201c\u2265r small fibres per z\u201d variant, provide a clean, rigorous rook-polynomial count; current asymptotic (e^{-r}+o(1))k! should be recorded with proof or citation.\n- Explore constraints (e.g., each f_i surjective, balanced fibres) under which upper bounds in terms of k,n may still hold; quantify maximal \u03c7 under such regularity.\n",

Given functions f_1,\u2026,f_k:E\u2192F with pointwise distinct outputs, define the conflict graph G on E by joining x\u2260y if \u2203 p\u2260q with f_p(x)=f_q(y).\nFor a set of functions, define n*:=max_{z\u2208F} min_{t\u2208[k]} |f_t^{-1}(z)|.\n\nLemma 1 (Permutation template yields complete G).\nLet F=[k], let E\u2286S_k, and define f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i). Then the conflict graph on E is complete.\nProof. For \u03c0\u2260\u03c3\u2208E, the permutations \u03c0^{-1} and \u03c3^{-1} differ, so choose s with \u03c0^{-1}(s)\u2260\u03c3^{-1}(s). Set p:=\u03c0^{-1}(s) and q:=\u03c3^{-1}(s). Then p\u2260q and f_p(\u03c0)=\u03c0(p)=s=\u03c3(q)=f_q(\u03c3), so \u03c0 and \u03c3 are adjacent. \u220e\n\nTheorem 2 (Strong counterexamples with prescribed n).\nFix k\u22653 and an integer n with 1\u2264n\u2264D_{k-1} (where D_m is the number of derangements of [m]). There exist functions f_1,\u2026,f_k:E\u2192[k] with pointwise distinct outputs such that n*=n and the conflict graph is complete with\n\u03c7(G)=|E|=D_k + kn.\nProof. Let E_0 be the set of derangements of [k], |E_0|=D_k. For each s\u2208[k], choose a set E_s of n permutations that fix s and have no other fixed points; this is possible since there are D_{k-1} such permutations for each s. Define E:=E_0 \u222a (\u22c3_{s=1}^k E_s) and f_i(\u03c0):=\u03c0(i).\nPointwise distinctness holds because each \u03c0 is a permutation. For each z=s, consider t=s. Then f_s^{-1}(s)=E_s, so |f_s^{-1}(s)|=n, hence min_{t}|f_t^{-1}(s)|\u2264n. Taking max over s gives n*\u2264n, while clearly n*\u2265n since for each s we have |f_s^{-1}(s)|=n. Thus n*=n. By Lemma 1 the conflict graph on E is complete, so \u03c7(G)=|E|=D_k+kn. \u220e\n\nCorollary 3 (Explicit k=3, n=1 counterexample).\nFor k=3, take E_0={(1 2 3),(1 3 2)} and E_1={ (2 3), (1 3), (1 2) }. With f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i), we have n*=1 and G=K_5, so 5 parts are needed although 2n*+1=3.\n\nTheorem 4 (Projective-plane family: all fibres size 1 and complete G).\nLet q be a prime power and set k:=q+1. Let PG(2,q) have point set F and line set E, each of size q^2+q+1=k^2\u2212k+1. Consider the incidence bipartite graph between F and E (each vertex has degree k). Properly edge-color this bipartite k-regular graph with k colors (by K\u0151nig\u2019s line-coloring theorem). For i\u2208[k] and L\u2208E define f_i(L) to be the unique point z\u2208F such that the incidence edge (z,L) has color i.\nThen for every z\u2208F and every i we have |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1, and for any distinct L,M\u2208E, the conflict graph has L adjacent to M. Consequently G is complete on |E|=k^2\u2212k+1 vertices and \u03c7(G)=k^2\u2212k+1 with n*=1.\nProof. At each vertex the k incident edges receive distinct colors among [k], so for fixed z and i there is exactly one L with color i at (z,L), giving |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1. For distinct lines L\u2260M, they meet in a unique point z; the two edges (z,L) and (z,M) receive distinct colors p\u2260q, hence f_p(L)=z=f_q(M), so L and M are adjacent. \u220e"
