Validated two strong counterexample families. 1) Permutation-based: for k≥3 and any 1≤n≤D_{k−1}, set E=derangements ∪ (nk permutations each fixing a prescribed symbol), define f_i(π)=π(i). Then n*=n, G is complete, and χ(G)=|D_k|+kn (k=3 yields K5 with n*=1). 2) Projective-plane: for k=q+1, define f_i via a k-edge-coloring of the incidence graph; all fibres equal 1 and G=K_{k^2−k+1}. A claimed upper bound m≤k^2−k+1 for n*=1 complete graphs is false (contradicted by the permutation family). Proofs for (1) and (2) appended; further work: rigorous counts for the “≥r small fibres per z” variant and exploring bounds under added regularity (e.g., surjectivity/balanced fibres).
