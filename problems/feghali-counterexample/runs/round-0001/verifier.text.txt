{"feedback_md":"Overall, there is substantial, correct progress with two complementary families of counterexamples: (i) permutation-based instances yielding complete conflict graphs with factorial chromatic number while keeping n*=1; (ii) projective-plane instances achieving n*=1 with the much stronger property that all fibres are size 1 across all indices, still forcing a complete graph of size ~k^2.\n\nKey correctness points\n- The conflict-graph viewpoint is correct: a partition with fp(Ei)∩fq(Ei)=∅ corresponds to a proper coloring of G.\n- For the permutation template f_i(π)=π(i) on any E⊆S_k, the conflict graph is indeed complete: for π≠σ pick s with π^{-1}(s)≠σ^{-1}(s); then f_{π^{-1}(s)}(π)=s=f_{σ^{-1}(s)}(σ) with different indices.\n- Prover 2’s constructions are valid: taking E=derangements D_k together with, for each s∈[k], one permutation fixing s (and no other point), gives n*=1 and χ(G)=|D_k|+k, with G complete. The generalization to any 1≤n≤D_{k-1} with χ=|D_k|+kn is also correct.\n- Prover 4’s statements mirror Prover 2 and are sound, including the explicit k=3 example yielding K5 with n*=1.\n- Prover 1’s projective-plane construction is correct and valuable: for k=q+1 there exist functions with |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all z,i and G=K_{k^2−k+1}.\n\nCritical issue\n- Prover 1’s “Optimality for n*=1” upper bound m≤k^2−k+1 for complete G is false. It is contradicted by the permutation-based family with n*=1 and m=|D_k|+k≫k^2 for k≥5. The flaw is the claim that among vertices x with z∈S_x the indices “used at z” must be all distinct; completeness does not force this at a fixed z.\n\nStrength against variants\n- The permutation family gives χ ≈ k!/e with n*=1, i.e., no bound of the form χ≤c(k)·n with subfactorial c(k) can hold. The projective-plane family shows robustness under much stronger fibre conditions (all fibres = 1), still forcing Θ(k^2) parts.\n\nNext steps\n- Formalize and include rigorous proofs for: (a) χ=|D_k|+kn with n*=n; (b) projective-plane construction. Done in proofs.md.\n- For the “≥r small fibres per z” variant, provide a clean, rigorous rook-polynomial count; current asymptotic (e^{-r}+o(1))k! should be recorded with proof or citation.\n- Explore constraints (e.g., each f_i surjective, balanced fibres) under which upper bounds in terms of k,n may still hold; quantify maximal χ under such regularity.\n","summary_md":"Validated two strong counterexample families. 1) Permutation-based: for k≥3 and any 1≤n≤D_{k−1}, set E=derangements ∪ (nk permutations each fixing a prescribed symbol), define f_i(π)=π(i).

For any distinct π,σ∈E there exists s with π^{-1}(s)≠σ^{-1}(s), yielding an edge. Hence G is complete for any E⊆S_k.\n- Take E = D_k (derangements) ∪ (for each s∈[k], pick n permutations that fix s and no other point). Then for z=s, choose t=s: f_s^{-1}(s) has size n. Therefore n* = n. G is complete, so χ(G)=|E|=|D_k|+kn. For n=1 this is ≈ k!/e + k.\n- Small explicit case k=3, n=1: E = {(1 2 3),(1 3 2)} ∪ {(2 3),(1 3),(1 2)}.

Given functions f_1,…,f_k:E→F with pointwise distinct outputs, define the conflict graph G on E by joining x≠y if ∃ p≠q with f_p(x)=f_q(y).\nFor a set of functions, define n*:=max_{z∈F} min_{t∈[k]} |f_t^{-1}(z)|.\n\nLemma 1 (Permutation template yields complete G).\nLet F=[k], let E⊆S_k, and define f_i(π)=π(i). Then the conflict graph on E is complete.\nProof. For π≠σ∈E, the permutations π^{-1} and σ^{-1} differ, so choose s with π^{-1}(s)≠σ^{-1}(s). Set p:=π^{-1}(s) and q:=σ^{-1}(s). Then p≠q and f_p(π)=π(p)=s=σ(q)=f_q(σ), so π and σ are adjacent. ∎\n\nTheorem 2 (Strong counterexamples with prescribed n).\nFix k≥3 and an integer n with 1≤n≤D_{k-1} (where D_m is the number of derangements of [m]). There exist functions f_1,…,f_k:E→[k] with pointwise distinct outputs such that n*=n and the conflict graph is complete with\nχ(G)=|E|=D_k + kn.\nProof. Let E_0 be the set of derangements of [k], |E_0|=D_k. For each s∈[k], choose a set E_s of n permutations that fix s and have no other fixed points; this is possible since there are D_{k-1} such permutations for each s. Define E:=E_0 ∪ (⋃_{s=1}^k E_s) and f_i(π):=π(i).\nPointwise distinctness holds because each π is a permutation. For each z=s, consider t=s. Then f_s^{-1}(s)=E_s, so |f_s^{-1}(s)|=n, hence min_{t}|f_t^{-1}(s)|≤n. Taking max over s gives n*≤n, while clearly n*≥n since for each s we have |f_s^{-1}(s)|=n. Thus n*=n. By Lemma 1 the conflict graph on E is complete, so χ(G)=|E|=D_k+kn. ∎\n\nCorollary 3 (Explicit k=3, n=1 counterexample).\nFor k=3, take E_0={(1 2 3),(1 3 2)} and E_1={ (2 3), (1 3), (1 2) }. With f_i(π)=π(i), we have n*=1 and G=K_5, so 5 parts are needed although 2n*+1=3.\n\nTheorem 4 (Projective-plane family: all fibres size 1 and complete G).\nLet q be a prime power and set k:=q+1. Let PG(2,q) have point set F and line set E, each of size q^2+q+1=k^2−k+1. Consider the incidence bipartite graph between F and E (each vertex has degree k). Properly edge-color this bipartite k-regular graph with k colors (by Kőnig’s line-coloring theorem). For i∈[k] and L∈E define f_i(L) to be the unique point z∈F such that the incidence edge (z,L) has color i.\nThen for every z∈F and every i we have |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1, and for any distinct L,M∈E, the conflict graph has L adjacent to M. Consequently G is complete on |E|=k^2−k+1 vertices and χ(G)=k^2−k+1 with n*=1.\nProof. At each vertex the k incident edges receive distinct colors among [k], so for fixed z and i there is exactly one L with color i at (z,L), giving |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1. For distinct lines L≠M, they meet in a unique point z; the two edges (z,L) and (z,M) receive distinct colors p≠q, hence f_p(L)=z=f_q(M), so L and M are adjacent. ∎"},"output_update":{"action":"append","content":"Counterexamples to the k-function partition conjecture\n- For every k≥3 and every integer n with 1≤n≤D_{k-1}, there exist functions f_1,…,f_k:E→[k] with pointwise distinct outputs and parameter n*=n such that the associated conflict graph is complete with χ(G)=|E|=D_k+kn.
