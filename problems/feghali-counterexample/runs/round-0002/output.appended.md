Counterexamples to the k-function partition conjecture
- For every k≥3 and every integer n with 1≤n≤D_{k-1}, there exist functions f_1,…,f_k:E→[k] with pointwise distinct outputs and parameter n*=n such that the associated conflict graph is complete with χ(G)=|E|=D_k+kn. In particular, for k=3 and n=1 one gets χ=5>2n+1=3.
- For infinitely many k (k=q+1 with q a prime power), there exist functions with the stronger property |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all z and all i, yet the conflict graph is complete on k^2−k+1 vertices, so χ(G)=k^2−k+1>2·1+1.
These show the proposed bound 2n+1 fails dramatically for k≥3, even when n=1 and under strong fibre-regularity conditions.
