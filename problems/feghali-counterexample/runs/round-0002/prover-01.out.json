  "content": "Ideas\n- Strengthen counterexamples along three axes: (A) keep n*=1 but maximize \u03c7; (B) require many small fibres per value z (\u2265 r indices t with |f_t^{-1}(z)|\u2264n); (C) enforce the strongest fibre regularity (all |f_i^{-1}(z)|\u2264n). We work in the conflict-graph model: partitions correspond to proper colorings; making G complete forces #parts=|E|.\n\n1) Permutation template, optimal for r=1 (sharp extremal count)\nConstruction: Let F=[k], E\u2286S_k, f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i). Fix a bijection \u03c4:F\u2192[k]; enforce the per-value constraint at cell (\u03c4(z),z). Set\n- E_0:= {\u03c0\u2208S_k : \u03c0(\u03c4(z))\u2260z for all z} (derangements w.r.t. \u03c4), so |E_0|=D_k.\n- For each z, choose a set U_z of size n consisting of permutations that hit exactly the cell (\u03c4(z),z) and avoid all other (\u03c4(z\u2032),z\u2032). There are D_{k-1} such permutations for each z, so this is feasible for any n\u2264D_{k-1}.\n- Let E:=E_0 \u2294 (\u22c3_z U_z).\nProperties:\n- Pointwise distinctness holds (permutations).\n- For each z, |f^{-1}_{\u03c4(z)}(z)|=n, hence n*:=max_z min_t |f_t^{-1}(z)|=n.\n- G is complete (any two distinct permutations differ on some symbol s, giving p=\u03c0^{-1}(s)\u2260\u03c3^{-1}(s) with f_p(\u03c0)=s=f_q(\u03c3)).\n- \u03c7(G)=|E|=D_k+k n.\nOptimality within the permutation template for r=1: If E\u2286S_k satisfies |{\u03c0\u2208E: \u03c0(\u03c4(z))=z}|\u2264n for all z, then writing B:=E\\E_0, every \u03c0\u2208B fixes at least one (\u03c4(z),z); assigning each \u03c0\u2208B to a canonical such z yields |B|\u2264\u2211_z n = k n, hence |E|\u2264D_k+k n. Our construction attains equality. Consequence: for any putative universal bound \u03c7(G)\u2264c(k) n*, necessarily c(k)\u2265D_k+k\u2248k!/e.\n\n2) Many small fibres per value z (\u2265 r indices)\nGoal: For each z, ensure at least r distinct indices t with |f_t^{-1}(z)|\u2264n, while keeping G complete and |E| large.\nTemplate: Choose r bijections \u03c4_1,\u2026,\u03c4_r:F\u2192[k] (equivalently, r disjoint perfect matchings in the k\u00d7k cell board). Define the \u201cforbidden cells\u201d A:=\u22c3_{j=1}^r {(\u03c4_j(z),z): z\u2208F}.\n- Base set E_0:= {\u03c0\u2208S_k : \u03c0 avoids A}.\n- For each pair (z,j), choose U_{z,j} of size n consisting of permutations having exactly one hit in A, namely at (\u03c4_j(z),z). Different U_{z,j} are automatically disjoint.\n- Take E:=E_0 \u2294 (\u22c3_{z,j} U_{z,j}).\nFibre control: For every z the r indices {\u03c4_j(z): j\u2208[r]} satisfy |f_{\u03c4_j(z)}^{-1}(z)|=n. Thus n*\u2264n and the stronger \u201c\u2265 r small fibres per z\u201d holds.\nCompleteness: As above, the permutation template yields G complete.\nLower bounds (explicit, uniform in k,r): View E_0 as perfect matchings in the bipartite graph K_{k,k} with the r matchings removed. Let A be the k\u00d7k 0\u20131 matrix of allowed cells; each row/column has exactly s:=k\u2212r ones. By van der Waerden\u2019s theorem applied to B:=A/s (doubly stochastic), the number of perfect matchings satisfies\n|E_0|=perm(A)\u2265(s^k)\u00b7(k!/k^k) = k!\u00b7(1\u2212r/k)^k.\nFor fixed (z,j), the number of permutations with exactly one hit at (\u03c4_j(z),z) and none elsewhere in A equals the permanent of the (k\u22121)\u00d7(k\u22121) submatrix obtained by deleting row \u03c4_j(z), column z; all its row/column sums equal s, so similarly\n|{\u03c0: \u03c0(\u03c4_j(z))=z and \u03c0 avoids A on other rows}| \u2265 (s^{k\u22121})\u00b7((k\u22121)!/k^{k\u22121}) = (k\u22121)!\u00b7(1\u2212r/k)^{k\u22121}.\nHence for any n\u2264(k\u22121)!\u00b7(1\u2212r/k)^{k\u22121} we can choose the U_{z,j}. Altogether\n|E| \u2265 k!\u00b7(1\u2212r/k)^k + k r n.\nAs k\u2192\u221e with r fixed, |E_0|\u223ce^{\u2212r}k!, so we still obtain factorial-size complete graphs even under the stronger \u201c\u2265 r small fibres per z\u201d hypothesis.\n\n3) Strongest fibre regularity: all fibres small simultaneously\nProjective-plane construction (robust): For k=q+1 with q a prime power, let F be the points and E the lines of PG(2,q). The incidence bipartite graph is k-regular, hence admits a proper k-edge-coloring. Define f_i(L) as the unique point z on L whose incidence edge has color i.\n- Pointwise distinctness holds on each L.\n- For all z and all i, |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1, so this satisfies the strongest fibre constraint with n=1.\n- Any two lines L\u2260M meet at a unique point z; at z the incident colors on L,M are distinct, so G is complete on |E|=q^2+q+1=k^2\u2212k+1. Thus n*=1 yet \u03c7(G)=k^2\u2212k+1.\nThis counters the \u201c2n+1\u201d target even under the much stronger uniform bound |f_i^{-1}(z)|\u22641.\n\nExamples\n- k=3, n=1 (permutation family): E consists of the two 3-cycles and the three transpositions. Then n*=1, G=K_5, \u03c7=5>3.\n- k=3, n=1 (projective plane PG(2,2)): |E|=7, all fibres equal 1, G=K_7.\n- General r: with r=2 and n=1, |E| \u2265 k!\u00b7(1\u22122/k)^k + 2k, which for k\u22656 already exceeds k^2 by orders of magnitude.\n\nObstacles and caveats\n- An earlier claimed upper bound m\u2264k^2\u2212k+1 for n*=1 is false (permutation examples give m\u2248k!/e). The error was assuming distinct indices at a fixed z are forced by completeness; they are not.\n- For r close to k, the base |E_0| can be very small ((1\u2212r/k)^k), but the construction still yields completeness and accommodates small n via the lower bound on |U_{z,j}|.\n\nConsequences and bounds on universal coefficients\n- Any universal linear bound \u03c7(G)\u2264c(k)\u00b7n* must satisfy c(k)\u2265D_k+k (from the r=1 permutation construction with n*=1), drastically strengthening the k lower bound. For k=q+1 prime power, also c(k)\u2265k^2\u2212k+1 from the projective-plane family.\n\nNext steps\n- Prove tightness of |E|=D_k+k n among all k-function instances (not just the permutation template) under the r=1 hypothesis; or find a larger family.\n- Extend the van der Waerden lower bounds to exact counts via rook polynomials for the union of r matchings; record asymptotics and explicit feasible ranges of n.\n- Explore additional regularity assumptions (e.g., each f_i surjective/balanced) and quantify the largest \u03c7(G) achievable under them."
