Ideas
- Strengthen counterexamples along three axes: (A) keep n*=1 but maximize χ; (B) require many small fibres per value z (≥ r indices t with |f_t^{-1}(z)|≤n); (C) enforce the strongest fibre regularity (all |f_i^{-1}(z)|≤n). We work in the conflict-graph model: partitions correspond to proper colorings; making G complete forces #parts=|E|.

1) Permutation template, optimal for r=1 (sharp extremal count)
Construction: Let F=[k], E⊆S_k, f_i(π)=π(i). Fix a bijection τ:F→[k]; enforce the per-value constraint at cell (τ(z),z). Set
- E_0:= {π∈S_k : π(τ(z))≠z for all z} (derangements w.r.t. τ), so |E_0|=D_k.
- For each z, choose a set U_z of size n consisting of permutations that hit exactly the cell (τ(z),z) and avoid all other (τ(z′),z′). There are D_{k-1} such permutations for each z, so this is feasible for any n≤D_{k-1}.
- Let E:=E_0 ⊔ (⋃_z U_z).
Properties:
- Pointwise distinctness holds (permutations).
- For each z, |f^{-1}_{τ(z)}(z)|=n, hence n*:=max_z min_t |f_t^{-1}(z)|=n.
- G is complete (any two distinct permutations differ on some symbol s, giving p=π^{-1}(s)≠σ^{-1}(s) with f_p(π)=s=f_q(σ)).
- χ(G)=|E|=D_k+k n.
Optimality within the permutation template for r=1: If E⊆S_k satisfies |{π∈E: π(τ(z))=z}|≤n for all z, then writing B:=E\E_0, every π∈B fixes at least one (τ(z),z); assigning each π∈B to a canonical such z yields |B|≤∑_z n = k n, hence |E|≤D_k+k n. Our construction attains equality. Consequence: for any putative universal bound χ(G)≤c(k) n*, necessarily c(k)≥D_k+k≈k!/e.

2) Many small fibres per value z (≥ r indices)
Goal: For each z, ensure at least r distinct indices t with |f_t^{-1}(z)|≤n, while keeping G complete and |E| large.
Template: Choose r bijections τ_1,…,τ_r:F→[k] (equivalently, r disjoint perfect matchings in the k×k cell board). Define the “forbidden cells” A:=⋃_{j=1}^r {(τ_j(z),z): z∈F}.
- Base set E_0:= {π∈S_k : π avoids A}.
- For each pair (z,j), choose U_{z,j} of size n consisting of permutations having exactly one hit in A, namely at (τ_j(z),z). Different U_{z,j} are automatically disjoint.
- Take E:=E_0 ⊔ (⋃_{z,j} U_{z,j}).
Fibre control: For every z the r indices {τ_j(z): j∈[r]} satisfy |f_{τ_j(z)}^{-1}(z)|=n. Thus n*≤n and the stronger “≥ r small fibres per z” holds.
Completeness: As above, the permutation template yields G complete.
Lower bounds (explicit, uniform in k,r): View E_0 as perfect matchings in the bipartite graph K_{k,k} with the r matchings removed. Let A be the k×k 0–1 matrix of allowed cells; each row/column has exactly s:=k−r ones. By van der Waerden’s theorem applied to B:=A/s (doubly stochastic), the number of perfect matchings satisfies
|E_0|=perm(A)≥(s^k)·(k!/k^k) = k!·(1−r/k)^k.
For fixed (z,j), the number of permutations with exactly one hit at (τ_j(z),z) and none elsewhere in A equals the permanent of the (k−1)×(k−1) submatrix obtained by deleting row τ_j(z), column z; all its row/column sums equal s, so similarly
|{π: π(τ_j(z))=z and π avoids A on other rows}| ≥ (s^{k−1})·((k−1)!/k^{k−1}) = (k−1)!·(1−r/k)^{k−1}.
Hence for any n≤(k−1)!·(1−r/k)^{k−1} we can choose the U_{z,j}. Altogether
|E| ≥ k!·(1−r/k)^k + k r n.
As k→∞ with r fixed, |E_0|∼e^{−r}k!, so we still obtain factorial-size complete graphs even under the stronger “≥ r small fibres per z” hypothesis.

3) Strongest fibre regularity: all fibres small simultaneously
Projective-plane construction (robust): For k=q+1 with q a prime power, let F be the points and E the lines of PG(2,q). The incidence bipartite graph is k-regular, hence admits a proper k-edge-coloring. Define f_i(L) as the unique point z on L whose incidence edge has color i.
- Pointwise distinctness holds on each L.
- For all z and all i, |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1, so this satisfies the strongest fibre constraint with n=1.
- Any two lines L≠M meet at a unique point z; at z the incident colors on L,M are distinct, so G is complete on |E|=q^2+q+1=k^2−k+1. Thus n*=1 yet χ(G)=k^2−k+1.
This counters the “2n+1” target even under the much stronger uniform bound |f_i^{-1}(z)|≤1.

Examples
- k=3, n=1 (permutation family): E consists of the two 3-cycles and the three transpositions. Then n*=1, G=K_5, χ=5>3.
- k=3, n=1 (projective plane PG(2,2)): |E|=7, all fibres equal 1, G=K_7.
- General r: with r=2 and n=1, |E| ≥ k!·(1−2/k)^k + 2k, which for k≥6 already exceeds k^2 by orders of magnitude.

Obstacles and caveats
- An earlier claimed upper bound m≤k^2−k+1 for n*=1 is false (permutation examples give m≈k!/e). The error was assuming distinct indices at a fixed z are forced by completeness; they are not.
- For r close to k, the base |E_0| can be very small ((1−r/k)^k), but the construction still yields completeness and accommodates small n via the lower bound on |U_{z,j}|.

Consequences and bounds on universal coefficients
- Any universal linear bound χ(G)≤c(k)·n* must satisfy c(k)≥D_k+k (from the r=1 permutation construction with n*=1), drastically strengthening the k lower bound. For k=q+1 prime power, also c(k)≥k^2−k+1 from the projective-plane family.

Next steps
- Prove tightness of |E|=D_k+k n among all k-function instances (not just the permutation template) under the r=1 hypothesis; or find a larger family.
- Extend the van der Waerden lower bounds to exact counts via rook polynomials for the union of r matchings; record asymptotics and explicit feasible ranges of n.
- Explore additional regularity assumptions (e.g., each f_i surjective/balanced) and quantify the largest χ(G) achievable under them.
