  "content": "Ideas\n- Keep the permutation template f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i) with E\u2286S_k, F=[k]. Then the conflict graph G on E is complete, so the number of parts needed equals |E|. This makes maximizing |E| while keeping the fibre parameter small the key task.\n- Enforce many \u201csmall fibres\u201d per value z by forbidding r permutation matchings of cells (i,z) and counting perfect matchings that avoid them via permanents. Van der Waerden\u2019s bound yields a clean, rigorous e^{-r}-fraction of all permutations.\n\nLemma A (completeness for permutation template)\nLet k\u22652, F=[k], E\u2286S_k, and f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i). For any distinct \u03c0,\u03c3\u2208E choose s with \u03c0^{-1}(s)\u2260\u03c3^{-1}(s). Then with p=\u03c0^{-1}(s), q=\u03c3^{-1}(s), p\u2260q and f_p(\u03c0)=s=f_q(\u03c3), hence xy is an edge. Thus G is complete on E.\nWhy useful: \u03c7(G)=|E|; any lower bound on |E| under fibre constraints gives a counterexample.\n\nProposition B (large core with \u2265r forbidden matchings via van der Waerden)\nFix k and r with 1\u2264r\u2264k. Let B be the union of r permutation matrices M_1,\u2026,M_r (i.e., forbidden cells (i,\u03c3_j(i)) in the k\u00d7k grid). Let A be the 0\u20131 matrix of allowed cells (complement of B). Then A has all row/column sums equal to t:=k\u2212r. The number of permutations avoiding B equals per(A). Since B\u2032:=A/t is doubly stochastic, van der Waerden yields per(B\u2032)\u2265k!/k^k, hence\nper(A) = t^k per(B\u2032) \u2265 ((k\u2212r)/k)^k k!.\nConsequently there exists a set E_0(r)\u2286S_k of size at least ((1\u2212r/k)^k)k! with \u03c0(i)\u2260\u03c3_j(i) simultaneously for all j,i.\nWhy useful: E_0(r) gives a factorial-sized complete conflict graph while guaranteeing that for every z and each j there are zero preimages along the index i where the j-th forbidden matching hits z.\n\nCorollary C (factorial counterexamples with \u2265r small fibres per z and n=1)\nFix r. Choose permutations \u03c3_1,\u2026,\u03c3_r of [k] and let B=\u22c3_{j} M(\u03c3_j). Let E_0(r) be as in Proposition B. For each (z,j), pick one permutation \u03c0^{(z,j)} with \u03c0^{(z,j)}(\u03c3_j^{-1}(z))=z and avoiding all other cells of B (exists by Hall\u2019s theorem; see also the quantitative bound below). Define\nE := E_0(r) \u222a {\u03c0^{(z,j)} : z\u2208[k], j\u2208[r]}.\nThen:\n- For every z, the r indices t_j:=\u03c3_j^{-1}(z) satisfy |f_{t_j}^{-1}(z)|=1 (only the one added \u03c0^{(z,j)}), so the \u201c\u2265r small fibres per z\u201d variant holds with n=1.\n- By Lemma A, G on E is complete, so \u03c7(G)=|E| \u2265 ((1\u2212r/k)^k)k! + rk.\n- In particular, for fixed r and large k, \u03c7(G) \u2265 (e^{-r}+o(1))k! with n=1. This rules out any bound of the form \u03c7\u2264c(k)\u00b7n with subfactorial c(k), even under the stronger requirement that each z has r distinct small fibres.\nSketch that the completions exist in quantity: For a fixed pair (z,j) with row i=\u03c3_j^{-1}(z) pinned, the remaining (k\u22121)\u00d7(k\u22121) allowed matrix has all row/column sums t (since we only removed row i and column z). Van der Waerden gives at least\n((k\u2212r)/(k\u22121))^{k\u22121} (k\u22121)!\ndistinct completions through that pinned cell, so we can choose the \u03c0^{(z,j)} distinct, and even n of them for any n up to this bound.\n\nGeneral n\nBy the same argument, for any 1\u2264n\u2264((k\u2212r)/(k\u22121))^{k\u22121}(k\u22121)!, we can pick for each (z,j) a set of n distinct completions. Then with E := E_0(r) \u222a \u22c3_{z,j} A_{z,j} (|A_{z,j}|=n), we get\n- For every z there are r indices t with |f_t^{-1}(z)|=n.\n- G is complete; hence \u03c7(G)=|E| \u2265 ((1\u2212r/k)^k)k! + rnk.\n- The intrinsic parameter n* is at most n (indeed equals 1 if some other index has a single preimage, but this only strengthens the counterexample).\n\nExample (small k)\n- k=3, r=1, pick \u03c3_1=id. Then per(A)\u2265((2/3)^3)\u00b76=16/9>1, and in fact |E_0(1)|=D_3=2. Adding \u03c0^{(1,1)},\u03c0^{(2,1)},\u03c0^{(3,1)} (the three transpositions) yields |E|=5, n=1, \u03c7(G)=5>2n+1=3.\n\nRobustness under very strong regularity\n- Projective-plane family: For k=q+1 (q prime power), let E=lines, F=points of PG(2,q). Properly edge-color the incidence bipartite graph with k colors and set f_i(L) to be the unique point of color i on L. Then |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all i,z (each f_i is a bijection), yet G is complete on |E|=k^2\u2212k+1, so \u03c7=k^2\u2212k+1>3. This demonstrates failure even when all fibres are equal to 1.\n\nObstacles/remarks\n- Tight counting for the union of r permutation matrices can be refined via rook polynomials; the van der Waerden bound already suffices for exponential-in-k lower bounds with the correct e^{-r} limit.\n- n* in the constructions with r\u22651 often equals 1 (not n) once other indices acquire at least one preimage via E_0(r); this only strengthens the negation of any 2n+1-type bound.\n\nNext steps\n- Record a concise proof that every allowed edge of A lies in some perfect matching (1-factorization of regular bipartite graphs), to justify the existence part without asymptotics.\n- Write the rook-polynomial derivation giving |E_0(r)|=(e^{-r}+o(1))k! and bounds on the number of completions through a fixed cell.\n- Explore upper bounds under extra regularity (e.g., all f_i surjective, nearly balanced fibres); the projective-plane family suggests \u0398(k^2) is attainable with all fibres 1.\n"
