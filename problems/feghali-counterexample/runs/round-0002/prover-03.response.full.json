But the original problem states that n must be a positive integer. It\u2019s a little confusing because while they can accept n \u2264 1, it complicates defining a minimal positive n.",

There's also the idea that the small fiber bound needs to be uniform across all functions. \n\nAnother option could be ensuring the fiber counts are balanced.

It turns out they don't, as they intersect in a subspace of dimension d\u22122. However, for our completeness requirement, we just need a point z where edge colors differ.

This implies that for each point, the adjacency relationship holds, and we maintain n = 1 overall.

The partition property is equivalent to a proper coloring; the minimum number of parts is \u03c7(G).\\n- Seek instances with n=1 that are robust under strong regularity constraints (all functions surjective, even bijective; all fibres equal; no \u201czero\u201d fibres). Achieve \u03c7(G) as large as possible, ideally complete graphs.\\n\\nA general design-based blueprint (very strong, n=1, all functions bijections)\\nLet (V,B,\ud835\udcd8) be a symmetric 2-(v,k,\u03bb) design (v=b, each block contains k points, each pair of blocks meets in exactly \u03bb\u22651 points). Let H be its incidence bipartite graph with bipartition (B,V): edge (B,z) iff z\u2208B. Then H is k-regular on both sides. By K\u0151nig\u2019s line-coloring theorem, H admits a proper k-edge-coloring with colors [k]; equivalently, a 1-factorization into k perfect matchings M_1,\u2026,M_k.\\nDefine functions f_i:B\u2192V as follows: for each block X\u2208B, let f_i(X)=z where (X,z)\u2208M_i. Since M_i is a perfect matching, f_i is a bijection B\u2192V; in particular, |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all i and z (so n=1 and every function is surjective). For any block X, the values {f_1(X),\u2026,f_k(X)} are precisely the k distinct points incident with X, so pointwise distinctness holds.\\n\\nLemma (completeness).\\nFor distinct X,Y\u2208B, the conflict graph on B is complete: X and Y are adjacent.\\nProof. Since \u03bb\u22651, X\u2229Y contains some point z. Let p be the color of edge (X,z) and q the color of (Y,z). As the edge-coloring is proper at z, p\u2260q. Hence f_p(X)=z=f_q(Y), so X and Y are adjacent in G. Therefore G is K_v and \u03c7(G)=v.\\n\\nConsequences.\\n- Extremely strong counterexample for the k-function problem with n=1: with k equal to the block size of a symmetric design and v blocks, we obtain \u03c7(G)=v, while 2n+1=3. This persists under the very strong constraints: all f_i are bijections; all fibres equal 1; for every z and every i, |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1; in particular no \u201czero-fibre\u201d shortcuts.\\n- This also settles natural stronger variants such as \u201cfor each z there are at least r functions with |f_t^{-1}(z)|\u22641\u201d: here r=k (maximal).\\n\\nInstantiation: finite projective spaces (hyperplanes vs points)\\nTake PG(d,q) with d\u22652. Let V be the set of points and B the set of hyperplanes. Then (V,B,\ud835\udcd8) is a symmetric 2-(v,k,\u03bb) design with\\nv = |V| = (q^{d+1}-1)/(q-1),\\nk = |X| = (q^{d}-1)/(q-1) for each hyperplane X,\\n\u03bb = (q^{d-1}-1)/(q-1) \u2265 1.\\nApply the blueprint to obtain k functions f_1,\u2026,f_k:B\u2192V with:\\n- pointwise distinctness,\\n- |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all i,z (so n=1),\\n- conflict graph G on B is complete, hence \u03c7(G)=|B|=v.\\nConcrete sizes: with k=(q^{d}-1)/(q-1) and n=1 we need at least v=(q^{d+1}-1)/(q-1) parts; for d=2 this is v=k^2\u2212k+1; for higher d, v\u2248q\u00b7k grows superlinearly in k.\\n\\nSmall explicit examples (checkable)\\n- k=3 (q=2,d=2): v=7. E=B= the 7 lines of the Fano plane; F=V= the 7 points. Each f_i is a bijection; |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all i,z; G=K_7; \u03c7=7>3.\\n- k=4 (q=3,d=2): v=13. E the 13 lines of PG(2,3), F the 13 points; \u03c7=13>3.\\n- k=7 (q=2,d=3): v=15, k=7; \u03c7=15>3.\\n\\nWhy this strengthens prior families\\n- Compared to permutation-based n=1 examples that relied on some functions having zero fibres at many z, the design family enforces the strongest uniformity: each f_i is a bijection and every fibre has size 1.\\n- It applies to several infinite families of k (all k of the form 1+q+\u22ef+q^{d\u22121}). In each, \u03c7(G) is quadratic (d=2) or larger (d\u22653) in k while n=1.\\n\\nObstacles/limits\\n- Symmetric 2-(v,k,1) designs are precisely projective planes; more general symmetric designs (\u03bb>1) still yield the same conclusion but with k and v constrained by design feasibility. Thus we get infinite families of strong counterexamples but not for all k.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Enumerate further symmetric designs (e.g., from classical polar spaces) to widen the k-range, recording the resulting (k,v) pairs and lower bounds \u03c7(G)=v for n=1.\\n- For k not covered by symmetric designs, explore near-symmetric bipartite graphs with degree k and 1-factorizations ensuring each f_i is surjective and fibres uniformly bounded (e.g., 1 or 2), while keeping pairwise left-neighborhoods intersecting to maintain completeness.\\n- Formalize a unifying lemma: any k-regular bipartite graph with a 1-factorization and pairwise-intersecting left neighborhoods yields the same n=1 complete-graph counterexample.\\n- Provide explicit constructions for k=5,6 via known symmetric designs (e.g., biplanes) where available.\\n\"}",
