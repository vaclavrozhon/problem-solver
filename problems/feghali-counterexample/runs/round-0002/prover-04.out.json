  "content": "Ideas\n- Use the conflict graph G on E: x\u2013y is an edge iff \u2203 p\u2260q with f_p(x)=f_q(y). Then a valid partition equals a proper coloring; the minimum number of parts is \u03c7(G).\n- Build families where G is complete (so \u03c7(G)=|E|) while the hypothesis on fibres is extremely strong. Two robust templates:\n  1) Permutation template: E\u2286S_k, F=[k], f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i). For any distinct \u03c0,\u03c3 and any symbol s with \u03c0^{-1}(s)\u2260\u03c3^{-1}(s), take p=\u03c0^{-1}(s), q=\u03c3^{-1}(s) to get an edge. Thus G is complete for any E\u2286S_k.\n  2) Bipartite-incidence template: Let B be a k-regular bipartite graph on (E,F) with a proper k-edge-coloring. Define f_i(x) as the unique neighbor of x via color i. If every two x,x\u2032\u2208E have a common neighbor in B, then G is complete.\n\nA stronger \u201c\u2265 r small fibres per z\u201d counterexample with quantitative size\nFix integers k\u22653 and 1\u2264r\u2264k\u22121. Let F=[k]. For each z\u2208[k], set T_z:={z,z+1,\u2026,z+r\u22121} (indices mod k). Let A be the k\u00d7k 0\u20131 matrix with A_{i,z}=1 iff i\u2209T_z (i.e., we forbid the r \u201ccyclic\u201d cells in each column). Each row and column of A has exactly k\u2212r ones. Let E be the set of permutations \u03c0 with A_{i,\u03c0(i)}=1 for all i (perfect matchings of A). Define f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i).\n- Fibres: For each z and each t\u2208T_z one has f_t^{-1}(z)=\u2205, hence for every z there are at least r indices with fibre size 0 (so the hypothesis holds with any n\u22651).\n- Distinctness: For fixed \u03c0, the values {f_i(\u03c0):i\u2208[k]} are the entries of a permutation, hence pairwise distinct.\n- Completeness: By the permutation template argument, G is complete on E.\n- Size of E (rigorous lower bound): A is the biadjacency of a (k\u2212r)-regular bipartite graph on k+k vertices. Let d:=k\u2212r. The normalized matrix B:=A/d is doubly-stochastic. By the Egorychev\u2013Falikman (van der Waerden) bound, per(B)\u2265k!/k^k, hence\n  |E| = per(A) = d^k per(B) \u2265 (k\u2212r)^k \u00b7 k!/k^k = ((1\u2212r/k)^k)\u00b7k!.\nThus \u03c7(G)=|E|\u2265((1\u2212r/k)^k)\u00b7k! \u2248 e^{\u2212r}\u00b7k! for fixed r and large k. Already with n=1 this forces astronomically many parts, despite the very strong fibre constraint \u201cfor each z at least r indices have fibre 0.\u201d\n\nProof details for the lower bound\nLet A be the 0\u20131 matrix above. Since each row and column sum equals d, the matrix B:=A/d is doubly-stochastic. The number of perfect matchings equals per(A)=d^k per(B). By Egorychev\u2013Falikman, per(B)\u2265k!/k^k, giving per(A)\u2265(d^k)(k!/k^k). This yields the stated bound. (For r=k\u22121, the construction leaves exactly one matching; the bound may be <1 but existence is trivial.)\n\nProjective-plane counterexamples with maximal regularity\nLet q be a prime power and set k:=q+1. Let E be the lines and F the points of the projective plane PG(2,q). The incidence bipartite graph is k-regular on both sides. By K\u0151nig\u2019s line-coloring theorem, it admits a proper k-edge-coloring decomposing edges into k perfect matchings. For i\u2208[k], define f_i(L) as the unique point incident to line L via a color-i edge.\n- Distinctness: For each line L, the q+1 incident edges have distinct colors, so the q+1 images f_i(L) (over i) are exactly the points on L, hence pairwise distinct.\n- Uniform fibres: For each point z and each i, |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 (each color class is a perfect matching), so all fibres are size 1 simultaneously.\n- Completeness: Any two lines L\u2260L\u2032 meet in a unique point z. At z the two incident edges (to L,L\u2032) have distinct colors i\u2260j, hence f_i(L)=z=f_j(L\u2032), giving an edge; thus G is complete.\nConsequently \u03c7(G)=|E|=q^2+q+1=k^2\u2212k+1, while n=1, so 2n+1=3 fails dramatically even under the stronger condition |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all z,i.\n\nSmall worked examples\n- k=3 (PG(2,2)): |E|=7, n=1, \u03c7(G)=7>3. Explicit Fano-plane realization gives a K_7.\n- k=4, r=2 (cyclic-permutation family): Each row/column has two allowed positions; the number of admissible permutations is \u2265 (2/4)^4\u00b74!=3 (bound) and in fact equals 4. This yields \u03c7(G)=4 with n=1 and at least two indices having fibre 0 for every z.\n\nObstacles and clarifications\n- For the \u201c\u2265 r small fibres per z\u201d family, n* (the intrinsic parameter max_z min_t |f_t^{-1}(z)|) equals 0. This is still a valid counterexample to the original 2n+1 claim by taking n=1, but n* no longer captures the strength of the hypothesis. The quantitative lower bound e^{\u2212r}k! shows that even demanding r\u22651 small fibres per z does not restore any bound of the form O_k(n) or O(n) with fixed k.\n- Trying to tune the above to force n* to equal a prescribed n\u22651 while simultaneously guaranteeing \u2265r small fibres per z leads to selection-interference issues among chosen permutations. This seems tractable only for very small n; a clean global selection without overlap is nontrivial.\n\nNext steps (auditable tasks)\n- Formalize a general \u201cbipartite template\u201d lemma: any k-regular bipartite graph on (E,F) with a proper k-edge-coloring yields a k-function instance; completeness of G is equivalent to pairwise co-neighborhood condition on E.\n- Record a precise theorem for the cyclic-permutation construction above, including the van der Waerden bound and an explicit Hall\u2019s theorem proof of existence for all r.\n- Explore whether one can simultaneously enforce: (i) \u2265r indices with fibres \u22641 for every z; (ii) n*=1 (rather than 0); while keeping G complete and |E|\u2265c_r\u00b7k!. An approach is to start from the cyclic family and add carefully designed, sparse \u201cwitness\u201d permutations per (t,z) while controlling overlaps via a sparse dependency graph; quantify via the Lov\u00e1sz Local Lemma.\n- Catalogue further finite-geometry sources beyond projective planes (e.g., linear spaces where any two blocks meet) to obtain infinite families for more k not of the form q+1."
