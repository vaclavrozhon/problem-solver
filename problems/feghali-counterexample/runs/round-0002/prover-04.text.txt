Ideas
- Use the conflict graph G on E: x–y is an edge iff ∃ p≠q with f_p(x)=f_q(y). Then a valid partition equals a proper coloring; the minimum number of parts is χ(G).
- Build families where G is complete (so χ(G)=|E|) while the hypothesis on fibres is extremely strong. Two robust templates:
  1) Permutation template: E⊆S_k, F=[k], f_i(π)=π(i). For any distinct π,σ and any symbol s with π^{-1}(s)≠σ^{-1}(s), take p=π^{-1}(s), q=σ^{-1}(s) to get an edge. Thus G is complete for any E⊆S_k.
  2) Bipartite-incidence template: Let B be a k-regular bipartite graph on (E,F) with a proper k-edge-coloring. Define f_i(x) as the unique neighbor of x via color i. If every two x,x′∈E have a common neighbor in B, then G is complete.

A stronger “≥ r small fibres per z” counterexample with quantitative size
Fix integers k≥3 and 1≤r≤k−1. Let F=[k]. For each z∈[k], set T_z:={z,z+1,…,z+r−1} (indices mod k). Let A be the k×k 0–1 matrix with A_{i,z}=1 iff i∉T_z (i.e., we forbid the r “cyclic” cells in each column). Each row and column of A has exactly k−r ones. Let E be the set of permutations π with A_{i,π(i)}=1 for all i (perfect matchings of A). Define f_i(π)=π(i).
- Fibres: For each z and each t∈T_z one has f_t^{-1}(z)=∅, hence for every z there are at least r indices with fibre size 0 (so the hypothesis holds with any n≥1).
- Distinctness: For fixed π, the values {f_i(π):i∈[k]} are the entries of a permutation, hence pairwise distinct.
- Completeness: By the permutation template argument, G is complete on E.
- Size of E (rigorous lower bound): A is the biadjacency of a (k−r)-regular bipartite graph on k+k vertices. Let d:=k−r. The normalized matrix B:=A/d is doubly-stochastic. By the Egorychev–Falikman (van der Waerden) bound, per(B)≥k!/k^k, hence
  |E| = per(A) = d^k per(B) ≥ (k−r)^k · k!/k^k = ((1−r/k)^k)·k!.
Thus χ(G)=|E|≥((1−r/k)^k)·k! ≈ e^{−r}·k! for fixed r and large k. Already with n=1 this forces astronomically many parts, despite the very strong fibre constraint “for each z at least r indices have fibre 0.”

Proof details for the lower bound
Let A be the 0–1 matrix above. Since each row and column sum equals d, the matrix B:=A/d is doubly-stochastic. The number of perfect matchings equals per(A)=d^k per(B). By Egorychev–Falikman, per(B)≥k!/k^k, giving per(A)≥(d^k)(k!/k^k). This yields the stated bound. (For r=k−1, the construction leaves exactly one matching; the bound may be <1 but existence is trivial.)

Projective-plane counterexamples with maximal regularity
Let q be a prime power and set k:=q+1. Let E be the lines and F the points of the projective plane PG(2,q). The incidence bipartite graph is k-regular on both sides. By Kőnig’s line-coloring theorem, it admits a proper k-edge-coloring decomposing edges into k perfect matchings. For i∈[k], define f_i(L) as the unique point incident to line L via a color-i edge.
- Distinctness: For each line L, the q+1 incident edges have distinct colors, so the q+1 images f_i(L) (over i) are exactly the points on L, hence pairwise distinct.
- Uniform fibres: For each point z and each i, |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 (each color class is a perfect matching), so all fibres are size 1 simultaneously.
- Completeness: Any two lines L≠L′ meet in a unique point z. At z the two incident edges (to L,L′) have distinct colors i≠j, hence f_i(L)=z=f_j(L′), giving an edge; thus G is complete.
Consequently χ(G)=|E|=q^2+q+1=k^2−k+1, while n=1, so 2n+1=3 fails dramatically even under the stronger condition |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all z,i.

Small worked examples
- k=3 (PG(2,2)): |E|=7, n=1, χ(G)=7>3. Explicit Fano-plane realization gives a K_7.
- k=4, r=2 (cyclic-permutation family): Each row/column has two allowed positions; the number of admissible permutations is ≥ (2/4)^4·4!=3 (bound) and in fact equals 4. This yields χ(G)=4 with n=1 and at least two indices having fibre 0 for every z.

Obstacles and clarifications
- For the “≥ r small fibres per z” family, n* (the intrinsic parameter max_z min_t |f_t^{-1}(z)|) equals 0. This is still a valid counterexample to the original 2n+1 claim by taking n=1, but n* no longer captures the strength of the hypothesis. The quantitative lower bound e^{−r}k! shows that even demanding r≥1 small fibres per z does not restore any bound of the form O_k(n) or O(n) with fixed k.
- Trying to tune the above to force n* to equal a prescribed n≥1 while simultaneously guaranteeing ≥r small fibres per z leads to selection-interference issues among chosen permutations. This seems tractable only for very small n; a clean global selection without overlap is nontrivial.

Next steps (auditable tasks)
- Formalize a general “bipartite template” lemma: any k-regular bipartite graph on (E,F) with a proper k-edge-coloring yields a k-function instance; completeness of G is equivalent to pairwise co-neighborhood condition on E.
- Record a precise theorem for the cyclic-permutation construction above, including the van der Waerden bound and an explicit Hall’s theorem proof of existence for all r.
- Explore whether one can simultaneously enforce: (i) ≥r indices with fibres ≤1 for every z; (ii) n*=1 (rather than 0); while keeping G complete and |E|≥c_r·k!. An approach is to start from the cyclic family and add carefully designed, sparse “witness” permutations per (t,z) while controlling overlaps via a sparse dependency graph; quantify via the Lovász Local Lemma.
- Catalogue further finite-geometry sources beyond projective planes (e.g., linear spaces where any two blocks meet) to obtain infinite families for more k not of the form q+1.
