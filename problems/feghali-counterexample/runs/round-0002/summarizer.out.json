  "summary_md": "This round produced several strong counterexamples to the proposed 2n+1 partition bound by recasting the problem via the conflict graph G (vertices E; x\u2013y iff \u2203 p\u2260q with f_p(x)=f_q(y)), so required parts = \u03c7(G). Main constructions: (i) permutation template f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i) on E\u2286S_k gives complete G with n*=(k-1)! and \u03c7=k!, hence \u03c7=k\u00b7n* (forcing any universal linear bound \u03c7\u2264c(k)n* to have c(k)\u2265k); (ii) derangement-based variant E = D_k \u222a (for each symbol s pick n permutations fixing s) yields prescribed n with \u03c7=D_k+kn (e.g. k=3,n=1 gives K5); (iii) projective-plane template (k=q+1) yields |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all i,z but G complete on k^2\u2212k+1 vertices. Extensions include factorial-size cores E_0(r) avoiding r forbidden matchings with |E_0(r)|\u2265((1\u2212r/k)^k)k! (van der Waerden). Caveat: a previously claimed m\u2264k^2\u2212k+1 for n*=1 is false. Source: papers/paper1.txt",
