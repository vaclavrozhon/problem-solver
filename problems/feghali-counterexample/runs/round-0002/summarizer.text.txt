{"summary_md":"This round produced several strong counterexamples to the proposed 2n+1 partition bound by recasting the problem via the conflict graph G (vertices E; x–y iff ∃ p≠q with f_p(x)=f_q(y)), so required parts = χ(G). Main constructions: (i) permutation template f_i(π)=π(i) on E⊆S_k gives complete G with n*=(k-1)! and χ=k!, hence χ=k·n* (forcing any universal linear bound χ≤c(k)n* to have c(k)≥k); (ii) derangement-based variant E = D_k ∪ (for each symbol s pick n permutations fixing s) yields prescribed n with χ=D_k+kn (e.g. k=3,n=1 gives K5); (iii) projective-plane template (k=q+1) yields |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all i,z but G complete on k^2−k+1 vertices. Extensions include factorial-size cores E_0(r) avoiding r forbidden matchings with |E_0(r)|≥((1−r/k)^k)k! (van der Waerden). Caveat: a previously claimed m≤k^2−k+1 for n*=1 is false.
