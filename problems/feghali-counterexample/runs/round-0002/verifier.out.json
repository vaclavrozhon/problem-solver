These definitively refute the 2n+1 bound for k\u22653 and underpin sharper impossibility results for linear-in-n bounds.\n\nCorrect and valuable:\n- Conflict-graph equivalence and the completeness of G for the permutation template f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i) are correct and used well by all. The tuned construction E=D_k\u222a(\u22c3_s E_s) (each E_s: permutations with unique fixed point s) yields n*=n and \u03c7=|D_k|+kn; this is rigorous and very strong. The k=3, n=1 K_5 example is a clean, explicit witness.\n- Projective plane/design template: via a k-edge-coloring of the incidence graph, each f_i is a bijection with |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1, and G is complete; \u03c7=k^2\u2212k+1 for n=1. The general symmetric-design blueprint is also correct.\n- New: the van der Waerden permanent lower bound for the union-of-r matchings (cyclic or general) is rigorous: |E_0(r)|\u2265((1\u2212r/k)^k)k!, giving factorial \u03c7 while ensuring \u2265r indices per z have fibre 0 (hence the variant with many small fibres per z fails badly already at n=1).\n\nIssues to fix/avoid:\n- Prover 2\u2019s quantitative lower bound for the number of \u201ccompletions through a fixed forbidden cell\u201d (after deleting a row/column) assumes uniform row/column sums; that submatrix is not regular in general, so the bound is unjustified. Use existence via Hall\u2019s theorem or rook polynomials, or omit quantitative counts for the pinned completions. Keep r=1 counts (|{\u03c0 with exactly one fixed point at s}|=D_{k\u22121}) which are standard.\n- Keep the \u201coptimality\u201d claim scoped: within the permutation template and a fixed transversal \u03c4, |E|\u2264D_k+kn holds; without a fixed bijection \u03c4 aligning columns to indices, it need not.\n\nNext steps:\n- Formalize: (a) optimality within the fixed-transversal template; (b) the E_0(r) permanent lower bound and the completeness of G; (c) a general \u201cbipartite template\u201d lemma (k-regular bipartite + k-edge-coloring + pairwise co-neighborhood \u21d2 all fibres 1 and G complete).\n- Either prove or drop quantitative \u201cpinned completion\u201d bounds for r\u22652; an existence proof via Hall/LLL would suffice for small n.\n- Explore upper bounds under added regularity (e.g., all f_i surjective/balanced).",

If E\u2286S_k satisfies |{\u03c0\u2208E: \u03c0(\u03c4(z))=z}|\u2264n for all z, then |E|\u2264D_k+kn. Proof idea: split E into those avoiding all k cells (\u03c4(z),z) (exactly D_k many) and those hitting at least one; assign each of the latter to the least z with \u03c0(\u03c4(z))=z to get an injection into \u22c3_z of n slots, hence \u2264kn.\n\n- Many small fibres per z via forbidden matchings: Let B be the union of r permutation matrices; let A be its complement (row/col sums = k\u2212r). Then E_0(r):={\u03c0: \u03c0 avoids B} has size per(A)\u2265((1\u2212r/k)^k)k! by van der Waerden (normalize A by k\u2212r).

Use Hall\u2019s theorem/rook polynomials/LLL for existence (sufficient for n=1) or omit counts.\n\n- General bipartite template: If B is a k-regular bipartite graph on (E,F) with a proper k-edge-coloring and every two vertices of E have a common neighbor in F, then defining f_i(x) as the neighbor of x in color i yields pointwise distinctness, |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all i,z (n=1), and G complete. Projective planes are a canonical example with |E|=k^2\u2212k+1.\n\nTo do: formalize Hall/rook-polynomial arguments for pinned completions (r\u22652); explore bounds under surjectivity/balanced-fibre constraints."

Suppose that for every z\u2208F we have N_z:=|{\u03c0\u2208E: \u03c0(\u03c4(z))=z}|\u2264n. Then |E|\u2264D_k+kn. Moreover, equality holds for E=D_k \u222a (\u22c3_{z} U_z), where each U_z consists of n permutations with exactly one fixed point at z.\nProof. Let E_0 be the set of \u03c0\u2208E with \u03c0(\u03c4(z))\u2260z for all z. The map \u03c0\u21a6\u03c0\u2218\u03c4 is a bijection S_k\u2192S_k sending E_0 to the usual derangements; hence |E_0|\u2264D_k. Let B:=E\\E_0. For \u03c0\u2208B, pick the smallest z (in a fixed total order on F) with \u03c0(\u03c4(z))=z, and assign \u03c0 to z. This assignment is injective into a multiset of size at most N_z per z, so |B|\u2264\u2211_z N_z\u2264kn. Thus |E|=|E_0|+|B|\u2264D_k+kn. The explicit construction shows equality is attainable. \u220e\n\nLemma (Factorial core avoiding r forbidden matchings).\nLet 1\u2264r\u2264k\u22121. Let B be the union of r permutation matrices in [k]\u00d7[k], and let A be the 0\u20131 complement. Then each row/column sum of A is d:=k\u2212r, and per(A)\u2265d^k\u00b7(k!/k^k)=((1\u2212r/k)^k)k!. Hence there exists E_0(r)\u2286S_k with |E_0(r)|\u2265((1\u2212r/k)^k)k! such that \u03c0(i) avoids the r forbidden columns for every i.\nProof. Normalize B:=A/d to obtain a doubly stochastic matrix. By Egorychev\u2013Falikman, per(B)\u2265k!/k^k. Therefore per(A)=d^k per(B)\u2265d^k\u00b7(k!/k^k). \u220e\n\nCorollary (Counterexamples with \u2265r small fibres per z at n=1).\nWith F=[k], E=E_0(r), f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i): for each z there are r indices t with f_t^{-1}(z)=\u2205, so the strengthened hypothesis (\u2265r small fibres per z) holds for n=1. By completeness of the permutation template, G is complete and \u03c7(G)=|E|\u2265((1\u2212r/k)^k)k!.\n\nLemma (General bipartite template for n=1 with all fibres 1).\nLet B be a k-regular bipartite graph with parts (E,F) and a proper k-edge-coloring with colors [k]. Define f_i(x) as the unique neighbor of x in color i. Then for all x\u2208E the values f_1(x),\u2026,f_k(x) are distinct; for all z\u2208F and i, |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1. If every two vertices of E have a common neighbor in F, then the conflict graph on E is complete. Hence \u03c7(G)=|E|. Projective planes PG(2,q) realize this with |E|=k^2\u2212k+1.\nProof. Edge-coloring gives distinct colors around each vertex and a perfect matching per color; thus |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1. If x\u2260y share z, denote by p (resp. q) the color of (x,z) (resp. (y,z)). Since the coloring is proper at z, p\u2260q and f_p(x)=z=f_q(y), giving adjacency; hence G is complete. \u220e"
