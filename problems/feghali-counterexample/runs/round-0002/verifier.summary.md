We verified two powerful counterexample families. 1) Permutation template: for any k≥3 and 1≤n≤D_{k−1}, build E with n*=n and G complete, giving χ=|D_k|+kn; in particular, for n=1 we get χ≈k!/e. 2) Projective-plane/design template: for k=q+1, all fibres equal 1 and G is complete on k^2−k+1 vertices (n=1). We also rigorously established a factorial-sized core E_0(r) avoiding r forbidden matchings with |E_0(r)|≥((1−r/k)^k)k!, giving counterexamples to the variant requiring ≥r small fibres per z. A prior “optimality for n*=1” claim was withdrawn; a correct “optimality within a fixed transversal” is recorded. Pending: rigorous treatment of pinned completions for r≥2.
