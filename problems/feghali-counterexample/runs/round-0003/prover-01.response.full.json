Also extract a clean coefficient lower bound for any linear \u03c7\u2264c(k)n*.\\n\\nProposition 1 (Permutation template, prescribed n, complete G, surjective f_i)\\n- Setup: F=[k], E\u2286S_k, f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i). Fix a bijection \u03c4:F\u2192[k]. Let E_0:= {\u03c0\u2208S_k : \u03c0(\u03c4(z))\u2260z for all z} (|E_0|=D_k). For each z\u2208F choose U_z\u2286{\u03c0\u2208S_k : \u03c0(\u03c4(z))=z and \u03c0(\u03c4(z\u2032))\u2260z\u2032 for z\u2032\u2260z} with |U_z|=n (feasible since there are D_{k-1} choices per z). Let E:=E_0 \u2294 (\u22c3_z U_z).\\n- Claims:\\n  1) Pointwise distinctness holds (permutations).\\n  2) n*:=max_z min_t |f_t^{-1}(z)| equals n via t=\u03c4(z) and |f_{\u03c4(z)}^{-1}(z)|=n.\\n  3) G is complete for any E\u2286S_k: if \u03c0\u2260\u03c3, pick s with \u03c0^{-1}(s)\u2260\u03c3^{-1}(s), then f_{\u03c0^{-1}(s)}(\u03c0)=s=f_{\u03c3^{-1}(s)}(\u03c3) with distinct indices.\\n  4) \u03c7(G)=|E|=D_k+kn.\\n  5) Each f_i is surjective: for z=i pick \u03c0\u2208U_i; for z\u2260i there are derangements in E_0 with \u03c0(i)=z.\\n- Optimality within fixed \u03c4: If E\u2286S_k satisfies |{\u03c0\u2208E: \u03c0(\u03c4(z))=z}|\u2264n for all z, then writing B:=E\\\\E_0 and assigning each \u03c0\u2208B to the least z with \u03c0(\u03c4(z))=z gives |B|\u2264kn, hence |E|\u2264D_k+kn. Our construction attains equality.\\n\\nCorollary (sharpened coefficient lower bound)\\n- If a universal linear bound \u03c7(G)\u2264c(k) n* holds for all instances, applying it to Proposition 1 with n=1 yields c(k)\u2265\u03c7= D_k+k \u2248 k!/e. This improves the k lower bound from the S_k instance.\\n\\nProposition 2 (Many small fibres per value; factorial \u03c7 at n=1)\\n- Let r\u2208{1,\u2026,k\u22121}. Pick r bijections \u03c4_1,\u2026,\u03c4_r:F\u2192[k] (r disjoint perfect matchings). Forbid the r\u00b7k cells B:=\u22c3_j{(\u03c4_j(z),z)}. Let A be the 0\u20131 complement (allowed cells). Define E_0(r):={\u03c0\u2208S_k: (i,\u03c0(i))\u2208A for all i}. With f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i):\\n  1) Pointwise distinctness holds.\\n  2) For every z, the r indices {\u03c4_j(z)} have |f_{\u03c4_j(z)}^{-1}(z)|=0, so the hypothesis holds with n=1 and, in fact, with \u201c\u2265 r\u201d small fibres per z.\\n  3) G is complete (as above).\\n  4) Lower bound on size: A has row/col sums s:=k\u2212r. Normalize B:=A/s to be doubly stochastic. By van der Waerden, perm(A)=|E_0(r)|\u2265 s^k\u00b7(k!/k^k)=k!\u00b7(1\u2212r/k)^k. Hence \u03c7(G)=|E_0(r)|\u2265k!\u00b7(1\u2212r/k)^k\u2248e^{\u2212r}k!.\\n\\nLemma (Bipartite-incidence template via symmetric designs)\\n- Let (F,E,\u2110) be a symmetric 2-(v,k,\u03bb) design (v=b, r=k). The incidence graph is k-regular bipartite, so has a proper k-edge-coloring by K\u0151nig\u2019s theorem. For i\u2208[k] and x\u2208E (a block), let f_i(x) be the unique point z\u2208F incident to x via color i.\\n- Then: (a) pointwise distinctness holds on each x; (b) for all z and all i, |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1; (c) any two blocks x\u2260y meet in \u03bb\u22651 points, and at each such point the two incident colors are distinct, hence x,y are adjacent; so G is complete on |E|=v.\\n- Example: PG(2,q) (\u03bb=1, k=q+1) gives n*=1 and \u03c7(G)=v=q^2+q+1=k^2\u2212k+1. Hadamard symmetric designs yield further infinite families with \u03c7 linear in v and uniform fibres 1.\\n\\nExamples\\n- k=3, n=1 (Proposition 1): E = {(1 2 3),(1 3 2)} \u222a {(2 3),(1 3),(1 2)}; n*=1; G=K_5; \u03c7=5>2\u00b71+1.\\n- k=q+1 (PG(2,q)): n*=1; \u03c7=k^2\u2212k+1; e.g., q=2: \u03c7=7>3.\\n- r=2, k=5 (Proposition 2): \u03c7\u22655!\u00b7(1\u22122/5)^5=120\u00b7(3/5)^5\u22489.3, so \u03c7\u22659 while n=1.\\n\\nObstacles\\n- Counting \u201cpinned completions\u201d (permutations using exactly one forbidden cell and avoiding the rest) for r\u22652 is delicate due to irregular submatrix degrees after row/column deletions; the naive uniform-degree lower bound is invalid. The van der Waerden lower bound above avoids this and suffices for factorial \u03c7 with n=1 and \u2265r zero-fibres per z.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Formalize Proposition 1\u2019s optimality within the fixed-transversal scheme in proofs.md (short pigeonhole proof included here).\\n- Record Proposition 2 with a precise van der Waerden proof and note that it works for any choice of r matchings; explore sharper counts for specific circulant unions via rook polynomials.\\n- Broaden the symmetric-design template beyond planes (Hadamard, Menon designs) to cover more k.\\n- Investigate upper/lower bounds under added regularity (e.g., each f_i surjective and nearly balanced fibres) to delineate the precise growth of \u03c7 in terms of k and n.\"}",
