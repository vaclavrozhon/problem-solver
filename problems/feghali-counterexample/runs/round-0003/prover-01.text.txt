Ideas
- Consolidate and strengthen counterexamples along three axes: (i) prescribed n with G complete and large χ; (ii) many small fibres per value (≥ r indices t per z) while keeping χ factorial; (iii) strongest uniform constraint |f_i^{-1}(z)|≤1 for all i,z with G complete on Θ(k^2) vertices. Also extract a clean coefficient lower bound for any linear χ≤c(k)n*.

Proposition 1 (Permutation template, prescribed n, complete G, surjective f_i)
- Setup: F=[k], E⊆S_k, f_i(π)=π(i). Fix a bijection τ:F→[k]. Let E_0:= {π∈S_k : π(τ(z))≠z for all z} (|E_0|=D_k). For each z∈F choose U_z⊆{π∈S_k : π(τ(z))=z and π(τ(z′))≠z′ for z′≠z} with |U_z|=n (feasible since there are D_{k-1} choices per z). Let E:=E_0 ⊔ (⋃_z U_z).
- Claims:
  1) Pointwise distinctness holds (permutations).
  2) n*:=max_z min_t |f_t^{-1}(z)| equals n via t=τ(z) and |f_{τ(z)}^{-1}(z)|=n.
  3) G is complete for any E⊆S_k: if π≠σ, pick s with π^{-1}(s)≠σ^{-1}(s), then f_{π^{-1}(s)}(π)=s=f_{σ^{-1}(s)}(σ) with distinct indices.
  4) χ(G)=|E|=D_k+kn.
  5) Each f_i is surjective: for z=i pick π∈U_i; for z≠i there are derangements in E_0 with π(i)=z.
- Optimality within fixed τ: If E⊆S_k satisfies |{π∈E: π(τ(z))=z}|≤n for all z, then writing B:=E\E_0 and assigning each π∈B to the least z with π(τ(z))=z gives |B|≤kn, hence |E|≤D_k+kn. Our construction attains equality.

Corollary (sharpened coefficient lower bound)
- If a universal linear bound χ(G)≤c(k) n* holds for all instances, applying it to Proposition 1 with n=1 yields c(k)≥χ= D_k+k ≈ k!/e. This improves the k lower bound from the S_k instance.

Proposition 2 (Many small fibres per value; factorial χ at n=1)
- Let r∈{1,…,k−1}. Pick r bijections τ_1,…,τ_r:F→[k] (r disjoint perfect matchings). Forbid the r·k cells B:=⋃_j{(τ_j(z),z)}. Let A be the 0–1 complement (allowed cells). Define E_0(r):={π∈S_k: (i,π(i))∈A for all i}. With f_i(π)=π(i):
  1) Pointwise distinctness holds.
  2) For every z, the r indices {τ_j(z)} have |f_{τ_j(z)}^{-1}(z)|=0, so the hypothesis holds with n=1 and, in fact, with “≥ r” small fibres per z.
  3) G is complete (as above).
  4) Lower bound on size: A has row/col sums s:=k−r. Normalize B:=A/s to be doubly stochastic. By van der Waerden, perm(A)=|E_0(r)|≥ s^k·(k!/k^k)=k!·(1−r/k)^k. Hence χ(G)=|E_0(r)|≥k!·(1−r/k)^k≈e^{−r}k!.

Lemma (Bipartite-incidence template via symmetric designs)
- Let (F,E,ℐ) be a symmetric 2-(v,k,λ) design (v=b, r=k). The incidence graph is k-regular bipartite, so has a proper k-edge-coloring by Kőnig’s theorem. For i∈[k] and x∈E (a block), let f_i(x) be the unique point z∈F incident to x via color i.
- Then: (a) pointwise distinctness holds on each x; (b) for all z and all i, |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1; (c) any two blocks x≠y meet in λ≥1 points, and at each such point the two incident colors are distinct, hence x,y are adjacent; so G is complete on |E|=v.
- Example: PG(2,q) (λ=1, k=q+1) gives n*=1 and χ(G)=v=q^2+q+1=k^2−k+1. Hadamard symmetric designs yield further infinite families with χ linear in v and uniform fibres 1.

Examples
- k=3, n=1 (Proposition 1): E = {(1 2 3),(1 3 2)} ∪ {(2 3),(1 3),(1 2)}; n*=1; G=K_5; χ=5>2·1+1.
- k=q+1 (PG(2,q)): n*=1; χ=k^2−k+1; e.g., q=2: χ=7>3.
- r=2, k=5 (Proposition 2): χ≥5!·(1−2/5)^5=120·(3/5)^5≈9.3, so χ≥9 while n=1.

Obstacles
- Counting “pinned completions” (permutations using exactly one forbidden cell and avoiding the rest) for r≥2 is delicate due to irregular submatrix degrees after row/column deletions; the naive uniform-degree lower bound is invalid. The van der Waerden lower bound above avoids this and suffices for factorial χ with n=1 and ≥r zero-fibres per z.

Next steps
- Formalize Proposition 1’s optimality within the fixed-transversal scheme in proofs.md (short pigeonhole proof included here).
- Record Proposition 2 with a precise van der Waerden proof and note that it works for any choice of r matchings; explore sharper counts for specific circulant unions via rook polynomials.
- Broaden the symmetric-design template beyond planes (Hadamard, Menon designs) to cover more k.
- Investigate upper/lower bounds under added regularity (e.g., each f_i surjective and nearly balanced fibres) to delineate the precise growth of χ in terms of k and n.
