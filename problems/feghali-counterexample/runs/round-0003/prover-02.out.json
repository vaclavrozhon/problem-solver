Thus the task reduces to maximizing |E| while enforcing the fibre constraint \u201cfor every z, \u2203 t with |f_t^{-1}(z)| \u2264 n\u201d.\n- Provide (i) a sharp upper bound for |E| when the \u201cwitness\u201d indices t(z) form a transversal (which they always can); (ii) extremal constructions meeting this bound, yielding factorial-sized counterexamples at n=1; (iii) a robust \u201cmany small fibres per z\u201d variant using van der Waerden\u2019s permanent bound.\n\nLemma 1 (Completeness in the permutation template)\nLet k\u22652, take F=[k], and define f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i) for \u03c0\u2208S_k. For any E\u2286S_k, the conflict graph G on E (xy adjacent iff \u2203 p\u2260q with f_p(x)=f_q(y)) is complete.\nProof. For \u03c0\u2260\u03c3 choose s with \u03c0^{-1}(s)\u2260\u03c3^{-1}(s). Then f_{\u03c0^{-1}(s)}(\u03c0)=s=f_{\u03c3^{-1}(s)}(\u03c3) with distinct indices.\nWhy useful: The number of parts equals \u03c7(G)=|E|.\n\nProposition 2 (Sharp upper bound under a fixed transversal; optimality of D_k+kn)\nFix a bijection \u03c4:[k]\u2192[k], and a set E\u2286S_k satisfying, for all z\u2208[k], the count C_z:=|{\u03c0\u2208E: \u03c0(\u03c4(z))=z}| \u2264 n. Then\n|E| \u2264 D_k + kn,\nwhere D_k is the number of derangements on [k]. Moreover, equality holds for E=D_k \u222a (\u22c3_{z} A_z), where each A_z consists of n permutations that fix z and no other point (relative to \u03c4).\nProof. Split E=A\u222aB where A consists of \u03c0 avoiding all \u201ctransversal\u201d cells (\u03c4(z),z) (so |A|\u2264D_k), and B the rest. Define S:=\u2211_{z} C_z \u2264 kn. Every \u03c0\u2208B hits at least one transversal cell, contributing \u22651 to S. Hence |B|\u2264S\u2264kn, giving |E|\u2264D_k+kn. For equality, take all derangements (|A|=D_k) and for each z pick n permutations with exactly one fixed point at (\u03c4(z),z) (exist since there are D_{k-1} choices), so C_z=n and every \u03c0\u2208B is assigned to its unique z.\nWhy useful: Within the permutation template the optimal |E| under the hypothesis is exactly D_k+kn.\n\nCorollary 3 (Tight factorial counterexample at n=1)\nTake \u03c4=id. Let E:=D_k \u222a {\u03c0^z: z\u2208[k]}, where each \u03c0^z has exactly one fixed point z. Then the hypothesis holds with n=1 (for each z choose t=z), \u03c7(G)=|E|=D_k+k, and by Lemma 1 the conflict graph is complete. Since D_k\u223ce^{-1}k!, this gives a K_{D_k+k} instance with n=1.\nSmall cases: k=3 gives |E|=5>2\u00b71+1, a K_5; k=4 gives |E|=9+4=13>3.\n\nTheorem 4 (Any linear bound \u03c7\u2264c(k)\u00b7n* must have c(k)\u2265D_k+k\u223ce^{-1}k!)\nLet c(k) be such that every instance with k functions satisfies \u03c7(G)\u2264c(k)\u00b7n*. Apply it to Corollary 3. There n*=1 and \u03c7(G)=D_k+k, hence c(k)\u2265D_k+k. In particular, no bound with c(k) subfactorial (e.g. polynomial) can hold.\nWhy useful: This strictly strengthens the linear lower bound c(k)\u2265k (from the k!/ (k\u22121)! example) to c(k)\u2265\u0398(k!).\n\nProposition 5 (Many small fibres per z; robust factorial core)\nFix integers k\u22652 and r with 1\u2264r\u2264k. Choose permutations \u03c3_1,\u2026,\u03c3_r of [k] and consider the \u201cforbidden board\u201d B=\u22c3_{j=1}^r{(i,\u03c3_j(i))}. Let E_0(r):={\u03c0\u2208S_k : \u03c0(i)\u2260\u03c3_j(i) for all i and j} be the permutations avoiding all r matchings. Then\n|E_0(r)| = per(A) \u2265 ((k\u2212r)/k)^k k! = ((1\u2212r/k)^k) k!,\nwhere A is the 0\u20131 allowed matrix (complement of B). Moreover, in the permutation template the conflict graph on E_0(r) is complete, and for every z there are at least r indices t with |f_t^{-1}(z)|=0. Thus the \u201c\u2265r small fibres per z\u201d variant (with n=1) admits instances with \u03c7(G)\u2265((1\u2212r/k)^k)k!\u2248e^{\u2212r}k!.\nProof. The matrix A has all row/column sums t=k\u2212r. Normalize B:=A/t to obtain a doubly-stochastic matrix. By Egorychev\u2013Falikman (van der Waerden), per(B)\u2265k!/k^k, hence per(A)=t^k per(B)\u2265((k\u2212r)/k)^k k!. Completeness follows from Lemma 1; the fibre claim is immediate by construction.\nWhy useful: Shows failure persists and is factorial even under a stronger assumption that each z has \u2265r small fibres (here equal to 0) at n=1.\n\nRemark 6 (Pinned completions through a prescribed forbidden cell)\nFix a forbidden cell (i_0,z_0) from some \u03c3_j. The number of \u03c0 with \u03c0(i_0)=z_0 and \u03c0 avoiding all other forbidden cells is at least\n((k\u2212r\u22121)/(k\u22121))^{k\u22121} (k\u22121)!,\nsince after fixing \u03c0(i_0)=z_0 and deleting row i_0 and column z_0, the residual (k\u22121)\u00d7(k\u22121) allowed matrix has all row/column sums equal to k\u2212r\u22121; apply van der Waerden as above. This yields many distinct \u201cpinned\u201d permutations if one wishes to realize small fibres with value 1 instead of 0.\n\nExamples\n- k=3, n=1: E=D_3\u222a{(12),(13),(23)} has |E|=5 and G=K_5.\n- k arbitrary, n=1: E=D_k\u222a{one single-fixed permutation per z} has |E|=D_k+k\u223ce^{-1}k!.\n- r\u22651 variant: For fixed r, E_0(r) alone (with n=1) has |E|\u2265(e^{\u2212r}+o(1))k! and G complete.\n\nObstacles and cautions\n- The upper bound |E|\u2264D_k+kn crucially uses that the \u201cwitness indices\u201d t(z) define a transversal of cells (i.e., one cell per column, in distinct rows). This is exactly the statement of the hypothesis (choosing a single t(z) per z globally). Without fixing a transversal, the counting argument must be rephrased, but the same reasoning applies once the witness choice is made.\n- For the r\u22652 \u201cpinned completion\u201d counts, the reduced matrix is not regular unless we delete the row/column of the pinned cell; the stated bound handles this correctly. Selecting distinct pinned permutations for all (z,j) simultaneously is unnecessary for our purposes (E_0(r) already gives factorial size), so we omit SDR details.\n\nNext steps\n- Record the proof of Proposition 2 and Theorem 4 into proofs.md; these give an essentially tight extremal picture within the permutation template for fixed n.\n- For the r\u22651 variant, add the van der Waerden-based bound rigorously (Proposition 5) and the \u201cpinned completion\u201d bound (Remark 6) via permanents of reduced matrices.\n- Explore maximal |E| under extra regularity: e.g., each f_i surjective (projective-plane template gives |E|\u2248k^2 at n=1; can one exceed quadratic?), and quantify tight upper bounds in that regime.\n"
