Each function f_i doesn\u2019t have to be bijective, and it\u2019s possible to ensure n=1 since each matching uses at most one x for a given z, meaning |f_i^{-1}(z)| is less than or equal to 1. However, not every z is surjective. If z has a degree less than k, some colors will have no edge at z, leading to zero fibers for those functions. The problem only requires that for any z, there's a t such that |f_t^{-1}(z)| is less than or equal to n; choosing n=1 works easily. For the stronger condition of \u201cno zero fibers,\u201d we need a right degree of at least 1 across all colors, which means perfect matchings for each color.

A valid partition is a proper coloring; #parts = \u03c7(G).\\n- Two complementary \u201cstrongest\u201d directions:\\n  1) Make \u03c7(G) as large as possible for fixed k and small n (ideally n=1), allowing zero fibres: factorial-size families via permutations.\\n  2) Impose strong uniformity (all fibres size 1, i.e., every f_i a bijection) and still force G complete: optimal quadratic-size families via symmetric designs; also prove an absolute upper bound in this regime.\\n\\nPermutation template with many small fibres per z (factorial \u03c7 at n=1)\\nConstruction (avoid r disjoint matchings).\\n- Let k\u22653 and fix r\u2208{1,\u2026,k\u22121}. Take F=[k], E\u2286S_k, and define f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i) (i\u2208[k]). Let P_1,\u2026,P_r be r disjoint permutation matrices (e.g. cyclic shifts). Let B:=P_1\u222a\u2026\u222aP_r and A:=J\u2212B (J all-ones). Define E_0(r):={\u03c0\u2208S_k : \u03c0 avoids B}, i.e., A\u2019s 1-entries.\\n- Conflict completeness: For \u03c0\u2260\u03c3, choose s with \u03c0^{-1}(s)\u2260\u03c3^{-1}(s); then f_{\u03c0^{-1}(s)}(\u03c0)=s=f_{\u03c3^{-1}(s)}(\u03c3) with distinct indices, so G is complete on E_0(r).\\n- Fibres: For each z and each j\u2208[r], the unique row t_j with P_j(t_j,z)=1 is forbidden. Hence f_{t_j}^{-1}(z)=\u2205 on E_0(r). Thus for every z there are \u2265 r indices t with |f_t^{-1}(z)|=0\u22641 (so the hypothesis holds with n=1, and even with the stronger variant \u201c\u2265r functions have small fibres per z\u201d).\\n- Size lower bound (van der Waerden): Scale A to A\u2032:=A/(k\u2212r), which is doubly stochastic. By van der Waerden, per(A\u2032)\u2265k!/k^k. Hence |E_0(r)|=per(A)=(k\u2212r)^k per(A\u2032) \u2265 k!(1\u2212r/k)^k \u2248 e^{\u2212r}k!.\\nConclusion: For any fixed r, we get \u03c7(G)=|E_0(r)|\u2265k!(1\u2212r/k)^k with n=1. This is essentially optimal in \u201csize vs. k\u201d among all counterexamples allowing zero fibres.\\n\\nA unifying bipartite-template lemma (n=1, bijective or surjective variants)\\nLemma (k-regular k-edge-coloring + pairwise co-neighborhoods \u21d2 complete G).\\nLet H be a k-regular bipartite graph with parts (E,F) and a proper k-edge-coloring into perfect matchings M_1,\u2026,M_k. Define f_i(x) to be the (unique) neighbor of x via matching M_i. Then:\\n- Distinctness: {f_1(x),\u2026,f_k(x)}=N_H(x), so values are pairwise distinct.\\n- Uniform fibres: For all i,z, |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 (each M_i is perfect), hence n=1 with no zero fibres.\\n- If every two x\u2260y in E have a common neighbor in H, then G is complete.\\nProof. Immediate from definitions and proper edge-coloring at each z, which guarantees the two colors used at a common neighbor are distinct.\\n\\nOptimal upper bound under bijective constraint (all |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1)\\nProposition (quadratic cap; equality at projective planes). Suppose |E|=|F|=v and for all i,z we have |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1. If G is complete, then v \u2264 k^2\u2212k+1. Equality holds iff every pair of x\u2260y has exactly one common image value (i.e., the incidence is a symmetric 2-(v,k,1) design, a projective plane).\\nProof. Let c_z:=|{x\u2208E : z\u2208{f_1(x),\u2026,f_k(x)}|}. Since each color is bijective and distinctness holds, c_z=k for every z. Double-count pairs of x\u2260y with a common z:\\n- LHS: sum_{z\u2208F} C(c_z,2)=v\u00b7C(k,2)=v\u00b7k(k\u22121)/2.\\n- RHS: at least C(v,2) since G is complete. Hence v\u00b7k(k\u22121)/2 \u2265 v(v\u22121)/2, i.e., v \u2264 k(k\u22121)+1. Equality forces every pair to meet in exactly one z.\\nCorollary (explicit families). For k=q+1 (q a prime power), take E=lines, F=points of PG(2,q). With a k-edge-coloring of the incidence graph, each f_i is a bijection, n=1, and G is K_{v} with v=k^2\u2212k+1. Small cases: k=3 gives v=7 (Fano plane); k=4 gives v=13; k=5 lacks \u03bb=1, but a symmetric (11,5,2) biplane gives v=11>3 (still n=1 and complete G).\\n\\nExtension: uniform r-to-1 fibres for all i,z\\nProposition. Suppose for some r\u22651, for all i and z we have |f_i^{-1}(z)|=r (so |E|=r|F|=:v, each f_i is surjective with constant fibres) and G is complete. Then v \u2264 kr(kr\u22121)+1.\\nProof. Let c_z be the number of x with z in {f_1(x),\u2026,f_k(x)}. Distinctness across colors at each x implies that the r preimages per color at z are all distinct across colors, hence c_z=kr for each z. By the same double-counting, sum_{z} C(c_z,2)=|F|\u00b7C(kr,2)\u2265C(v,2). Since |F|=v/r, we get (v/r)\u00b7kr(kr\u22121)/2 \u2265 v(v\u22121)/2, i.e., v \u2264 kr(kr\u22121)+1. For r=1 we recover the bijective bound.\\nRemark. This shows that even under strong uniformity (no zeros and all fibres equal r), \u03c7(G) cannot exceed \u0398((kr)^2). The projective-plane case (r=1) is optimal; it is natural to ask for constructions near the bound for r>1.\\n\\nExplicit small examples (checkable)\\n- k=3 (Fano plane): v=7; three bijections f_1,f_2,f_3 with |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1; G=K_7; \u03c7=7>3.\\n- k=3, permutation family: take E={(123),(132)}\u222a{(23),(13),(12)}; n=1; G=K_5.\\n- k\u22653, factorial family with r=1: E_0(1) has size \u2265k!(1\u22121/k)^k\u2248(k!/e); n=1; G complete.\\n\\nObstacles/limits\\n- Within the bijective class (|f_i^{-1}(z)|=1), v\u2264k^2\u2212k+1 is tight; cannot hope for superquadratic \u03c7 at n=1 without allowing zero fibres.\\n- For the \u201c\u2265r small fibres per z\u201d variant, the E_0(r) construction is rigorous; pinned-completion counts for mixing additional constraints should use rook-polynomial/LLL rather than ad hoc row/column regularity.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Document a clean proof (notes/proofs) of the E_0(r) result with the van der Waerden bound and explicit choice of r disjoint permutation matrices; include the completeness check.\\n- Add the general bipartite-template lemma and the quadratic upper bound propositions (bijective case, and r-to-1 generalization) to proofs.md; they clarify optimality within strong-regularity regimes.\\n- Catalogue more symmetric designs (biplanes, Hadamard-derived symmetric designs) to extend the set of k with n=1 and complete G, recording their v and comparing to k^2\u2212k+1.\\n- Explore near-extremal constructions for r\u22652 approaching v\u2248kr(kr\u22121)+1.\\n\"}",
