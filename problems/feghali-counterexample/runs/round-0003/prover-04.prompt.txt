Try to find as strong as possible counterexample to the following question: 

Problem 1. A function theoretic problem, with possible applications to digraphs (suggested by Carl Feghali) Statement and Motivation: Consider two functions f and g from a set E into a set F such that f(x) 6= g(x) for every x ∈ E . Suppose that there exists a positive integer n such that for any element z in F either |f −1 (z)| ≤ n or |g −1 (z)| ≤ n. It was shown in [2] that E can be partitioned into 2n + 1 subsets E1, E2, . . . , , E2n+1 such that f(Ei) ∩ g(Ei) = ∅ for each 1 ≤ i ≤ 2n + 1. This result has nice applications in digraphs, and a short proof was later given in [1]. Question: Is it possible to generalise the above to any number of functions? More specifically, consider functions f1, . . . , fk from a set E into a set F such that fi(x) 6= fj (x) for every x ∈ E and 1 ≤ i < j ≤ k. Suppose that there exists a positive integer n such that for any element z in F, there exists an integer t ∈ {1, . . . , k} such that |f −1 t (z)| ≤ n. Is it true that E can be partitioned into 2n + 1 subsets of E1, . . . , E2n+1 such that fp(Ei) ∩ fq(Ei) = ∅ for each 1 ≤ i ≤ 2n + 1 and 1 ≤ p < q ≤ k?

Attached is a simple counterexample, but perhaps there are stronger ones that also apply to natural weaker variants of the question.

# Research Notes



Counterexample families and conflict-graph view

- Conflict graph G: vertices E; edge x–y iff ∃ p≠q with f_p(x)=f_q(y). A valid partition equals a proper coloring; #parts = χ(G).

Permutation-based counterexamples (very strong)
- Template: k functions on E⊆S_k, F=[k], f_i(π)=π(i). For any distinct π,σ∈E there exists s with π^{-1}(s)≠σ^{-1}(s), yielding an edge. Hence G is complete for any E⊆S_k.
- Take E = D_k (derangements) ∪ (for each s∈[k], pick n permutations that fix s and no other point). Then for z=s, choose t=s: f_s^{-1}(s) has size n. Therefore n* = n. G is complete, so χ(G)=|E|=|D_k|+kn. For n=1 this is ≈ k!/e + k.
- Small explicit case k=3, n=1: E = {(1 2 3),(1 3 2)} ∪ {(2 3),(1 3),(1 2)}. Then χ(G)=5 while 2n+1=3.
- Variant (informal): For r≥1, by forbidding r disjoint perfect matchings of cells one can pick a large set E_0(r) with |E_0(r)|≈e^{-r}k!, and still ensure that for each z there are ≥ r indices whose fibres at z have size ≤ n after adding nk more permutations. Completeness persists. Rigor via rook polynomials to be written.

Projective-plane counterexamples (robust under strong fibre constraints)
- For k=q+1 (q a prime power): E = lines, F = points in PG(2,q). Proper k-edge-color the incidence bipartite graph; for i∈[k], define f_i(L) to be the point incident to L via color i. Then for all z and i, |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1. Any two lines meet in one point z and receive distinct colors there, so G is complete on |E|=k^2−k+1. Thus n*=1 yet χ(E)=k^2−k+1 > 2n+1.

Caveat / correction
- A proposed general upper bound m≤k^2−k+1 for n*=1 and complete G is false; permutation-based n*=1 examples give m≈k!/e. The mistaken step was assuming that among vertices containing a given z the indices used at z must be distinct; completeness does not force this at a fixed z.

Takeaways
- The permutation family shows that, even with n*=1, χ can be factorial in k; the projective-plane family shows robustness when all fibres are forced to be size 1 simultaneously.
- Next: formalize the r≥1 variant counts; explore upper bounds under added regularity (e.g., all f_i surjective or balanced fibre sizes).

Further refinements and cautions

- Fixed-transversal optimality (permutation template): Fix a bijection τ:F→[k]. If E⊆S_k satisfies |{π∈E: π(τ(z))=z}|≤n for all z, then |E|≤D_k+kn. Proof idea: split E into those avoiding all k cells (τ(z),z) (exactly D_k many) and those hitting at least one; assign each of the latter to the least z with π(τ(z))=z to get an injection into ⋃_z of n slots, hence ≤kn.

- Many small fibres per z via forbidden matchings: Let B be the union of r permutation matrices; let A be its complement (row/col sums = k−r). Then E_0(r):={π: π avoids B} has size per(A)≥((1−r/k)^k)k! by van der Waerden (normalize A by k−r). With f_i(π)=π(i), for every z there are r indices with fibre 0, G is complete, and χ=|E_0(r)| is factorial.

- Caution: Quantitative bounds for the number of permutations that use a fixed forbidden cell (i,z) and avoid all others were claimed using a uniform-row/column argument; this submatrix is not regular in general. Use Hall’s theorem/rook polynomials/LLL for existence (sufficient for n=1) or omit counts.

- General bipartite template: If B is a k-regular bipartite graph on (E,F) with a proper k-edge-coloring and every two vertices of E have a common neighbor in F, then defining f_i(x) as the neighbor of x in color i yields pointwise distinctness, |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all i,z (n=1), and G complete. Projective planes are a canonical example with |E|=k^2−k+1.

To do: formalize Hall/rook-polynomial arguments for pinned completions (r≥2); explore bounds under surjectivity/balanced-fibre constraints.

# Main Results



Counterexamples to the k-function partition conjecture
- For every k≥3 and every integer n with 1≤n≤D_{k-1}, there exist functions f_1,…,f_k:E→[k] with pointwise distinct outputs and parameter n*=n such that the associated conflict graph is complete with χ(G)=|E|=D_k+kn. In particular, for k=3 and n=1 one gets χ=5>2n+1=3.
- For infinitely many k (k=q+1 with q a prime power), there exist functions with the stronger property |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all z and all i, yet the conflict graph is complete on k^2−k+1 vertices, so χ(G)=k^2−k+1>2·1+1.
These show the proposed bound 2n+1 fails dramatically for k≥3, even when n=1 and under strong fibre-regularity conditions.

Additional main result (many small fibres per value): For any k≥3 and integer r with 1≤r≤k−1, there exist functions f_1,…,f_k:E→[k] with pointwise distinct outputs such that for every z, at least r indices t satisfy |f_t^{-1}(z)|=0 (hence the hypothesis holds with n=1), while the associated conflict graph is complete with χ(G)≥((1−r/k)^k)k!≈e^{−r}k!. Thus even strong variants requiring many small fibres per z admit factorial-size counterexamples at n=1.


=== Round 1 Summary ===

This round produced strong counterexamples to the multi-function partition conjecture by viewing valid partitions as colorings of the conflict graph G (edge x–y iff ∃ p≠q with f_p(x)=f_q(y)). Two main families were developed: (1) Permutation template f_i(π)=π(i) on E=S_k gives G complete, n*=(k-1)!, and χ=k!, so χ = k·n*; hence any universal linear bound χ ≤ c(k)n* must have c(k) ≥ k (see paper1). (2) Projective-plane construction for k=q+1 yields |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all i,z but G complete on k^2−k+1 vertices, so n*=1 yet χ is quadratic in k. An explicit small example k=3,n=1 produces K5. Constructions with prescribed n using derangements were also given.


=== Round 2 Summary ===

This round produced several strong counterexamples to the proposed 2n+1 partition bound by recasting the problem via the conflict graph G (vertices E; x–y iff ∃ p≠q with f_p(x)=f_q(y)), so required parts = χ(G). Main constructions: (i) permutation template f_i(π)=π(i) on E⊆S_k gives complete G with n*=(k-1)! and χ=k!, hence χ=k·n* (forcing any universal linear bound χ≤c(k)n* to have c(k)≥k); (ii) derangement-based variant E = D_k ∪ (for each symbol s pick n permutations fixing s) yields prescribed n with χ=D_k+kn (e.g. k=3,n=1 gives K5); (iii) projective-plane template (k=q+1) yields |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all i,z but G complete on k^2−k+1 vertices. Extensions include factorial-size cores E_0(r) avoiding r forbidden matchings with |E_0(r)|≥((1−r/k)^k)k! (van der Waerden). Caveat: a previously claimed m≤k^2−k+1 for n*=1 is false.

=== Previous Round Feedback ===

Strong progress with two rigorous families: (i) permutation-based complete graphs achieving χ≈k!/e with n*=1; (ii) finite-geometry (projective planes/designs) with all fibres equal to 1 and χ≈k^2 for n=1. These definitively refute the 2n+1 bound for k≥3 and underpin sharper impossibility results for linear-in-n bounds.

Correct and valuable:
- Conflict-graph equivalence and the completeness of G for the permutation template f_i(π)=π(i) are correct and used well by all. The tuned construction E=D_k∪(⋃_s E_s) (each E_s: permutations with unique fixed point s) yields n*=n and χ=|D_k|+kn; this is rigorous and very strong. The k=3, n=1 K_5 example is a clean, explicit witness.
- Projective plane/design template: via a k-edge-coloring of the incidence graph, each f_i is a bijection with |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1, and G is complete; χ=k^2−k+1 for n=1. The general symmetric-design blueprint is also correct.
- New: the van der Waerden permanent lower bound for the union-of-r matchings (cyclic or general) is rigorous: |E_0(r)|≥((1−r/k)^k)k!, giving factorial χ while ensuring ≥r indices per z have fibre 0 (hence the variant with many small fibres per z fails badly already at n=1).

Issues to fix/avoid:
- Prover 2’s quantitative lower bound for the number of “completions through a fixed forbidden cell” (after deleting a row/column) assumes uniform row/column sums; that submatrix is not regular in general, so the bound is unjustified. Use existence via Hall’s theorem or rook polynomials, or omit quantitative counts for the pinned completions. Keep r=1 counts (|{π with exactly one fixed point at s}|=D_{k−1}) which are standard.
- Keep the “optimality” claim scoped: within the permutation template and a fixed transversal τ, |E|≤D_k+kn holds; without a fixed bijection τ aligning columns to indices, it need not.

Next steps:
- Formalize: (a) optimality within the fixed-transversal template; (b) the E_0(r) permanent lower bound and the completeness of G; (c) a general “bipartite template” lemma (k-regular bipartite + k-edge-coloring + pairwise co-neighborhood ⇒ all fibres 1 and G complete).
- Either prove or drop quantitative “pinned completion” bounds for r≥2; an existence proof via Hall/LLL would suffice for small n.
- Explore upper bounds under added regularity (e.g., all f_i surjective/balanced).

\title{A Sharp Linear Lower Bound in the Multi-Function Partition Problem}
\author{}
\date{}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We consider $k\ge2$ functions $f_1,\dots,f_k:E\to F$ with pointwise distinct outputs and the associated \emph{conflict graph} $G$ on $E$, where $xy$ is an edge iff there exist $p\ne q$ with $f_p(x)=f_q(y)$. Let
\[
n^{*} \;:=\; \max_{z\in F}\ \min_{t\in[k]} |f_t^{-1}(z)|
\]
be the intrinsic fibre parameter. We prove that any general linear upper bound of the form
$\chi(G)\le c(k)\,n^{*}$ (valid for all such instances with $k$ functions) must satisfy $c(k)\ge k$ for every $k\ge2$.
The proof uses a permutation construction with $\chi(G)=k!$ and $n^{*}=(k-1)!$.
\end{abstract}

\section{Setup}
Let $k\ge2$ and $f_1,\dots,f_k:E\to F$ satisfy \emph{pointwise distinctness}:
\[
\forall x\in E,\ \ \text{the values } f_1(x),\dots,f_k(x)\ \text{are pairwise distinct}.
\]
Define the \emph{conflict graph} $G$ on vertex set $E$ by joining distinct $x,y\in E$ whenever
\begin{equation}\label{eq:conflict}
\exists\, p\ne q\in[k]\ \ \text{such that}\ \ f_p(x)=f_q(y).
\end{equation}
A partition $E=\bigsqcup_i E_i$ has the property that $f_p(E_i)\cap f_q(E_i)=\varnothing$ for all $p\ne q$ if and only if each $E_i$ is a stable set in $G$; hence the minimum number of parts equals $\chi(G)$.

We measure the ``size'' of fibres by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:nstar}
n^{*} \;:=\; \max_{z\in F}\ \min_{t\in[k]} |f_t^{-1}(z)|,
\end{equation}
the smallest integer $n$ for which the hypothesis ``$\forall z\ \exists t$ with $|f_t^{-1}(z)|\le n$'' holds.

\section{A permutation construction}
Let $E=S_k$ be the set of all permutations of $[k]=\{1,\dots,k\}$, take $F=[k]$, and define
\begin{equation}\label{eq:perm}
f_i(\pi)\ :=\ \pi(i)\qquad(\pi\in S_k,\ i\in[k]).
\end{equation}
Pointwise distinctness holds since $\{\pi(1),\dots,\pi(k)\}=[k]$ for each $\pi$.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:complete}
For the instance \eqref{eq:perm}, the conflict graph $G$ is complete on $|E|=k!$ vertices.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $\pi\ne\sigma\in S_k$. Choose a symbol $s\in[k]$ such that $\pi^{-1}(s)\ne\sigma^{-1}(s)$ (some symbol moves position).
Then with $p:=\pi^{-1}(s)$ and $q:=\sigma^{-1}(s)$ we have $p\ne q$ and
\[
f_p(\pi)=\pi(p)=s=\sigma(q)=f_q(\sigma).
\]
By \eqref{eq:conflict}, $\pi$ and $\sigma$ are adjacent. Hence every pair is adjacent and $G$ is complete.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:nstar}
For the instance \eqref{eq:perm}, for every $z\in[k]$ and $i\in[k]$ the fibre size $|f_i^{-1}(z)|=(k-1)!$. Consequently $n^*=(k-1)!$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Fix $i$ and $z$. The constraint $f_i(\pi)=z$ is $\pi(i)=z$. The remaining $k-1$ positions can be permuted arbitrarily, giving $(k-1)!$ permutations. For fixed $z$, the minimum of $|f_i^{-1}(z)|$ over $i$ is therefore $(k-1)!$, and taking the maximum over $z$ yields $n^{*}=(k-1)!$.
\end{proof}

Combining Lemmas~\ref{lem:complete} and \ref{lem:nstar} we obtain
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ratio}
\chi(G) \ =\ k!\ =\ k\cdot (k-1)!\ =\ k\,n^{*} .
\end{equation}

\section{Main lower bound}
\begin{theorem}[Sharp linear lower bound]\label{thm:ck}
Let $c:\{2,3,\dots\}\to\mathbb{R}_{\ge0}$ be any function with the property that \emph{for every} instance of $k$ functions as above, the associated conflict graph $G$ satisfies
\[
\chi(G)\ \le\ c(k)\,n^{*}.
\]
Then necessarily $c(k)\ge k$ for every $k\ge2$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Apply the assumed bound to the permutation instance \eqref{eq:perm}. By \eqref{eq:ratio} we have $\chi(G)=k\,n^{*}$, hence
\[
k\,n^{*} \ =\ \chi(G)\ \le\ c(k)\,n^{*}.
\]
Since $n^{*}>0$, it follows that $c(k)\ge k$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
The proof is purely extremal and shows that the linear coefficient in any universal bound of the form $\chi(G)\le c(k)\,n^{*}$ cannot be smaller than $k$. In particular, no bound independent of $k$ is possible, and any attempt to use a constant $<k$ fails already on the permutation family.
\end{remark}
