Strong counterexamples are those with G complete and |E| large under the fibre constraints.\\n- Consolidate two regimes with sharp bounds: (A) the permutation template f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i) on E\u2286S_k (factorial-size E); (B) the bijection/surjectivity regime where each f_i is a bijection E\u2192F (quadratic-size E), where we now prove a tight upper bound matching the projective plane construction.\\n\\nPermutation template: sharp extremal size under a fixed transversal (n arbitrary)\\nDefinition. Fix k\u22653, F=[k], and define f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i) on E\u2286S_k. For a map \u03c4:F\u2192[k] (a bijection/transversal), call the k cells C_\u03c4:={(\u03c4(z),z): z\u2208[k]} the designated cells. Suppose the \u201cexists t for each z with |f_t^{-1}(z)|\u2264n\u201d hypothesis is realized by \u03c4, i.e., the number of \u03c0\u2208E hitting cell (\u03c4(z),z) is \u2264 n for each z.\\nProposition (Sharp upper bound within the permutation template). Under these caps, one has |E| \u2264 D_k + k n, where D_k is the derangement number. Moreover, for every integer n with 1\u2264n\u2264D_{k-1}, there is a choice of E with |E|=D_k+kn for which G is complete.\\nProof sketch.\\n- Upper bound: Split E into E_0 of permutations avoiding all designated cells and E_1 of those that hit at least one. The set E_0 has size D_k via conjugation by \u03c4 (avoiding C_\u03c4 is equivalent to being a derangement). Each permutation in E_1 hits \u22651 designated cell; counting by cells gives |E_1| \u2264 \u2211_{z} n = kn. Hence |E|\u2264D_k+kn.\\n- Tightness: Take E_0:= all derangements (avoid all C_\u03c4), and for each z pick n permutations with a unique fixed point at z (hence they hit exactly one cell in C_\u03c4); there are D_{k-1} such choices per z, so feasible for n\u2264D_{k-1}. For any distinct \u03c0,\u03c3, choose a symbol s with \u03c0^{-1}(s)\u2260\u03c3^{-1}(s); then f_{\u03c0^{-1}(s)}(\u03c0)=s=f_{\u03c3^{-1}(s)}(\u03c3) with different indices, so G is complete. Thus \u03c7(G)=|E|=D_k+kn.\\nConsequence. For every k\u22653 and 1\u2264n\u2264D_{k-1}, there are instances with \u03c7(G)=D_k+kn, vastly larger than 2n+1 (e.g., k=3,n=1 gives \u03c7=5>3; for large k and fixed n, \u03c7\u2248k!/e).\\n\\nBijection/surjectivity regime: a tight quadratic ceiling and its attainment\\nSetup. Assume |E|=|F|=:m and each f_i:E\u2192F is a bijection (equivalently, |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all i,z; hence n=1). Define \u03c3_i:=f_i and D:={\u03c3_q^{-1}\u03c3_p: p\u2260q}\u2286Sym(F).\\nLemma (Pair-cover counting). If the conflict graph G is complete, then for every ordered pair (x,y) with x\u2260y there exists \u03b4\u2208D with \u03b4(x)=y.\\nProof. Completeness says \u2200 x\u2260y, \u2203 p\u2260q with f_p(x)=f_q(y). Equivalently, \u03c3_q^{-1}\u03c3_p(x)=y.\\nTheorem (Tight bound in the bijection regime). If all f_i are bijections and G is complete, then m\u2264k^2\u2212k+1. This is best-possible for infinitely many k.\\nProof. Each \u03b4\u2208D is a bijection, so accounts for exactly m ordered pairs (x,\u03b4(x)). Since |D|\u2264k(k\u22121), the total number of covered pairs is \u2264 k(k\u22121)\u00b7m. Completeness demands coverage of all m(m\u22121) ordered pairs with x\u2260y, hence m(m\u22121)\u2264k(k\u22121)m, i.e., m\u2264k^2\u2212k+1. Attainment: For k=q+1 (q a prime power), take the projective plane PG(2,q): E=lines, F=points; its incidence bipartite graph is k-regular and k-edge-colorable. Let f_i map each line to its unique incident point along color i. Then each f_i is a bijection, any two lines meet in a unique point where the colors differ, so G is complete on m=q^2+q+1=k^2\u2212k+1 vertices.\\nCorollary. Under the strong constraint \u201ceach f_i is surjective (indeed bijective)\u201d and n=1, the maximal \u03c7(G) is exactly k^2\u2212k+1, attained by projective planes. Hence the projective-plane construction is optimal in this regime.\\n\\nMany small fibres per z: factorial-size counterexamples at n=1\\nConstruction. Fix k\u22653 and 1\u2264r\u2264k\u22121. For each column z\u2208[k], forbid the r cyclic cells T_z={z,z+1,\u2026,z+r\u22121} (mod k). Let A be the k\u00d7k 0\u20131 matrix with A_{i,z}=1 iff i\u2209T_z. Let E be the set of permutations \u03c0 that avoid all forbidden cells (i.e., perfect matchings of A), and define f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i).\\n- For each z, the r indices in T_z have f_t^{-1}(z)=\u2205, so the hypothesis holds with n=1 but in a stronger \u201c\u2265r small fibres per z\u201d form.\\n- The conflict graph is complete by the permutation argument.\\n- Size lower bound: A has constant row/column sums d:=k\u2212r. Normalize B:=A/d; it is doubly-stochastic. By Egorychev\u2013Falikman (van der Waerden), per(B)\u2265k!/k^k. Thus\\n  |E|=per(A)=d^k per(B) \u2265 (k\u2212r)^k \u00b7 k!/k^k = ((1\u2212r/k)^k)\u00b7k! \u2265 e^{\u2212r}\u00b7k!\u00b7(1\u2212o(1)).\\nHence \u03c7(G) is factorial in k already for n=1 and any fixed r\u22651.\\n\\nGeneral bipartite-incidence template (unifies finite-geometry examples)\\nLemma. Let B be a k-regular bipartite graph on (E,F) with a proper k-edge-coloring. For each i\u2208[k], define f_i(x) as the unique neighbor of x via color i. If every pair x\u2260y in E has a common neighbor in F, then:\\n- Distinctness holds for each x (colors at x are distinct neighbors).\\n- |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all i,z (each color class is a perfect matching).\\n- G is complete (any two x,y share a neighbor z at distinct colors i\u2260j).\\nThis yields \u03c7(G)=|E|. Projective planes arise as the special case where every pair of blocks meets.\\n\\nExamples\\n- k=3, bijection regime: m\u22647. The Fano plane gives m=7, n=1, \u03c7=7.\\n- k=4, bijection regime: m\u226413. PG(2,3) gives m=13, n=1, \u03c7=13.\\n- k=5, permutation template with n=1: pick E=D_5\u222a{one unique-fixed permutation per z}; then \u03c7=|D_5|+5=44+5=49\u226b3.\\n\\nObstacles/clarifications\\n- The upper bound |E|\u2264D_k+kn applies to the permutation template under a fixed transversal \u03c4 selecting the \u201cwitness\u201d t(z). This is the relevant situation because, for any instance satisfying \u201c\u2200z \u2203t(z) with |f_t^{-1}(z)|\u2264n,\u201d one may fix such a \u03c4 and then argue within this capped-cell model.\\n- For \u201cpinned completions through a fixed forbidden cell,\u201d uniform row/column arguments fail; we avoid such counts and rely on Hall/van der Waerden where needed.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Record a short, formal proof of the bijection bound m\u2264k^2\u2212k+1 (above) in proofs.md and add the projective-plane attainment. This pins down optimality under surjectivity.\\n- Add the sharp bound |E|\u2264D_k+kn and its tight construction for the permutation template (this gives \u03c7 exactly), with a clean statement referencing the transversal \u03c4.\\n- Extend the \u201c\u2265r small fibres per z\u201d construction to allow also prescribing a budget n\u22651 on one designated index per z while keeping \u03c7 exponential in k; a Lopsided LLL selection atop the d-regular core is a plausible path.\\n- Explore other symmetric designs (beyond projective planes) to cover additional k with m close to k^2\u2212k+1 in the bijection regime.\"}",
