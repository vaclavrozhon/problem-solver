Ideas
- Keep the conflict-graph viewpoint: a valid partition into parts E_i with fp(E_i)∩fq(E_i)=∅ is exactly a proper coloring of G on E, where xy is an edge iff ∃ p≠q with f_p(x)=f_q(y). Strong counterexamples are those with G complete and |E| large under the fibre constraints.
- Consolidate two regimes with sharp bounds: (A) the permutation template f_i(π)=π(i) on E⊆S_k (factorial-size E); (B) the bijection/surjectivity regime where each f_i is a bijection E→F (quadratic-size E), where we now prove a tight upper bound matching the projective plane construction.

Permutation template: sharp extremal size under a fixed transversal (n arbitrary)
Definition. Fix k≥3, F=[k], and define f_i(π)=π(i) on E⊆S_k. For a map τ:F→[k] (a bijection/transversal), call the k cells C_τ:={(τ(z),z): z∈[k]} the designated cells. Suppose the “exists t for each z with |f_t^{-1}(z)|≤n” hypothesis is realized by τ, i.e., the number of π∈E hitting cell (τ(z),z) is ≤ n for each z.
Proposition (Sharp upper bound within the permutation template). Under these caps, one has |E| ≤ D_k + k n, where D_k is the derangement number. Moreover, for every integer n with 1≤n≤D_{k-1}, there is a choice of E with |E|=D_k+kn for which G is complete.
Proof sketch.
- Upper bound: Split E into E_0 of permutations avoiding all designated cells and E_1 of those that hit at least one. The set E_0 has size D_k via conjugation by τ (avoiding C_τ is equivalent to being a derangement). Each permutation in E_1 hits ≥1 designated cell; counting by cells gives |E_1| ≤ ∑_{z} n = kn. Hence |E|≤D_k+kn.
- Tightness: Take E_0:= all derangements (avoid all C_τ), and for each z pick n permutations with a unique fixed point at z (hence they hit exactly one cell in C_τ); there are D_{k-1} such choices per z, so feasible for n≤D_{k-1}. For any distinct π,σ, choose a symbol s with π^{-1}(s)≠σ^{-1}(s); then f_{π^{-1}(s)}(π)=s=f_{σ^{-1}(s)}(σ) with different indices, so G is complete. Thus χ(G)=|E|=D_k+kn.
Consequence. For every k≥3 and 1≤n≤D_{k-1}, there are instances with χ(G)=D_k+kn, vastly larger than 2n+1 (e.g., k=3,n=1 gives χ=5>3; for large k and fixed n, χ≈k!/e).

Bijection/surjectivity regime: a tight quadratic ceiling and its attainment
Setup. Assume |E|=|F|=:m and each f_i:E→F is a bijection (equivalently, |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all i,z; hence n=1). Define σ_i:=f_i and D:={σ_q^{-1}σ_p: p≠q}⊆Sym(F).
Lemma (Pair-cover counting). If the conflict graph G is complete, then for every ordered pair (x,y) with x≠y there exists δ∈D with δ(x)=y.
Proof. Completeness says ∀ x≠y, ∃ p≠q with f_p(x)=f_q(y). Equivalently, σ_q^{-1}σ_p(x)=y.
Theorem (Tight bound in the bijection regime). If all f_i are bijections and G is complete, then m≤k^2−k+1. This is best-possible for infinitely many k.
Proof. Each δ∈D is a bijection, so accounts for exactly m ordered pairs (x,δ(x)). Since |D|≤k(k−1), the total number of covered pairs is ≤ k(k−1)·m. Completeness demands coverage of all m(m−1) ordered pairs with x≠y, hence m(m−1)≤k(k−1)m, i.e., m≤k^2−k+1. Attainment: For k=q+1 (q a prime power), take the projective plane PG(2,q): E=lines, F=points; its incidence bipartite graph is k-regular and k-edge-colorable. Let f_i map each line to its unique incident point along color i. Then each f_i is a bijection, any two lines meet in a unique point where the colors differ, so G is complete on m=q^2+q+1=k^2−k+1 vertices.
Corollary. Under the strong constraint “each f_i is surjective (indeed bijective)” and n=1, the maximal χ(G) is exactly k^2−k+1, attained by projective planes. Hence the projective-plane construction is optimal in this regime.

Many small fibres per z: factorial-size counterexamples at n=1
Construction. Fix k≥3 and 1≤r≤k−1. For each column z∈[k], forbid the r cyclic cells T_z={z,z+1,…,z+r−1} (mod k). Let A be the k×k 0–1 matrix with A_{i,z}=1 iff i∉T_z. Let E be the set of permutations π that avoid all forbidden cells (i.e., perfect matchings of A), and define f_i(π)=π(i).
- For each z, the r indices in T_z have f_t^{-1}(z)=∅, so the hypothesis holds with n=1 but in a stronger “≥r small fibres per z” form.
- The conflict graph is complete by the permutation argument.
- Size lower bound: A has constant row/column sums d:=k−r. Normalize B:=A/d; it is doubly-stochastic. By Egorychev–Falikman (van der Waerden), per(B)≥k!/k^k. Thus
  |E|=per(A)=d^k per(B) ≥ (k−r)^k · k!/k^k = ((1−r/k)^k)·k! ≥ e^{−r}·k!·(1−o(1)).
Hence χ(G) is factorial in k already for n=1 and any fixed r≥1.

General bipartite-incidence template (unifies finite-geometry examples)
Lemma. Let B be a k-regular bipartite graph on (E,F) with a proper k-edge-coloring. For each i∈[k], define f_i(x) as the unique neighbor of x via color i. If every pair x≠y in E has a common neighbor in F, then:
- Distinctness holds for each x (colors at x are distinct neighbors).
- |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all i,z (each color class is a perfect matching).
- G is complete (any two x,y share a neighbor z at distinct colors i≠j).
This yields χ(G)=|E|. Projective planes arise as the special case where every pair of blocks meets.

Examples
- k=3, bijection regime: m≤7. The Fano plane gives m=7, n=1, χ=7.
- k=4, bijection regime: m≤13. PG(2,3) gives m=13, n=1, χ=13.
- k=5, permutation template with n=1: pick E=D_5∪{one unique-fixed permutation per z}; then χ=|D_5|+5=44+5=49≫3.

Obstacles/clarifications
- The upper bound |E|≤D_k+kn applies to the permutation template under a fixed transversal τ selecting the “witness” t(z). This is the relevant situation because, for any instance satisfying “∀z ∃t(z) with |f_t^{-1}(z)|≤n,” one may fix such a τ and then argue within this capped-cell model.
- For “pinned completions through a fixed forbidden cell,” uniform row/column arguments fail; we avoid such counts and rely on Hall/van der Waerden where needed.

Next steps
- Record a short, formal proof of the bijection bound m≤k^2−k+1 (above) in proofs.md and add the projective-plane attainment. This pins down optimality under surjectivity.
- Add the sharp bound |E|≤D_k+kn and its tight construction for the permutation template (this gives χ exactly), with a clean statement referencing the transversal τ.
- Extend the “≥r small fibres per z” construction to allow also prescribing a budget n≥1 on one designated index per z while keeping χ exponential in k; a Lopsided LLL selection atop the d-regular core is a plausible path.
- Explore other symmetric designs (beyond projective planes) to cover additional k with m close to k^2−k+1 in the bijection regime.
