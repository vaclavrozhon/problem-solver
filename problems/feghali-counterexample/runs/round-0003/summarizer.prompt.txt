Try to find as strong as possible counterexample to the following question: 

Problem 1. A function theoretic problem, with possible applications to digraphs (suggested by Carl Feghali) Statement and Motivation: Consider two functions f and g from a set E into a set F such that f(x) 6= g(x) for every x ∈ E . Suppose that there exists a positive integer n such that for any element z in F either |f −1 (z)| ≤ n or |g −1 (z)| ≤ n. It was shown in [2] that E can be partitioned into 2n + 1 subsets E1, E2, . . . , , E2n+1 such that f(Ei) ∩ g(Ei) = ∅ for each 1 ≤ i ≤ 2n + 1. This result has nice applications in digraphs, and a short proof was later given in [1]. Question: Is it possible to generalise the above to any number of functions? More specifically, consider functions f1, . . . , fk from a set E into a set F such that fi(x) 6= fj (x) for every x ∈ E and 1 ≤ i < j ≤ k. Suppose that there exists a positive integer n such that for any element z in F, there exists an integer t ∈ {1, . . . , k} such that |f −1 t (z)| ≤ n. Is it true that E can be partitioned into 2n + 1 subsets of E1, . . . , E2n+1 such that fp(Ei) ∩ fq(Ei) = ∅ for each 1 ≤ i ≤ 2n + 1 and 1 ≤ p < q ≤ k?

Attached is a simple counterexample, but perhaps there are stronger ones that also apply to natural weaker variants of the question.

Counterexample families and conflict-graph view

- Conflict graph G: vertices E; edge x–y iff ∃ p≠q with f_p(x)=f_q(y). A valid partition equals a proper coloring; #parts = χ(G).

Permutation-based counterexamples (very strong)
- Template: k functions on E⊆S_k, F=[k], f_i(π)=π(i). For any distinct π,σ∈E there exists s with π^{-1}(s)≠σ^{-1}(s), yielding an edge. Hence G is complete for any E⊆S_k.
- Take E = D_k (derangements) ∪ (for each s∈[k], pick n permutations that fix s and no other point). Then for z=s, choose t=s: f_s^{-1}(s) has size n. Therefore n* = n. G is complete, so χ(G)=|E|=|D_k|+kn. For n=1 this is ≈ k!/e + k.
- Small explicit case k=3, n=1: E = {(1 2 3),(1 3 2)} ∪ {(2 3),(1 3),(1 2)}. Then χ(G)=5 while 2n+1=3.
- Variant (informal): For r≥1, by forbidding r disjoint perfect matchings of cells one can pick a large set E_0(r) with |E_0(r)|≈e^{-r}k!, and still ensure that for each z there are ≥ r indices whose fibres at z have size ≤ n after adding nk more permutations. Completeness persists. Rigor via rook polynomials to be written.

Projective-plane counterexamples (robust under strong fibre constraints)
- For k=q+1 (q a prime power): E = lines, F = points in PG(2,q). Proper k-edge-color the incidence bipartite graph; for i∈[k], define f_i(L) to be the point incident to L via color i. Then for all z and i, |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1. Any two lines meet in one point z and receive distinct colors there, so G is complete on |E|=k^2−k+1. Thus n*=1 yet χ(E)=k^2−k+1 > 2n+1.

Caveat / correction
- A proposed general upper bound m≤k^2−k+1 for n*=1 and complete G is false; permutation-based n*=1 examples give m≈k!/e. The mistaken step was assuming that among vertices containing a given z the indices used at z must be distinct; completeness does not force this at a fixed z.

Takeaways
- The permutation family shows that, even with n*=1, χ can be factorial in k; the projective-plane family shows robustness when all fibres are forced to be size 1 simultaneously.
- Next: formalize the r≥1 variant counts; explore upper bounds under added regularity (e.g., all f_i surjective or balanced fibre sizes).

Further refinements and cautions

- Fixed-transversal optimality (permutation template): Fix a bijection τ:F→[k]. If E⊆S_k satisfies |{π∈E: π(τ(z))=z}|≤n for all z, then |E|≤D_k+kn. Proof idea: split E into those avoiding all k cells (τ(z),z) (exactly D_k many) and those hitting at least one; assign each of the latter to the least z with π(τ(z))=z to get an injection into ⋃_z of n slots, hence ≤kn.

- Many small fibres per z via forbidden matchings: Let B be the union of r permutation matrices; let A be its complement (row/col sums = k−r). Then E_0(r):={π: π avoids B} has size per(A)≥((1−r/k)^k)k! by van der Waerden (normalize A by k−r). With f_i(π)=π(i), for every z there are r indices with fibre 0, G is complete, and χ=|E_0(r)| is factorial.

- Caution: Quantitative bounds for the number of permutations that use a fixed forbidden cell (i,z) and avoid all others were claimed using a uniform-row/column argument; this submatrix is not regular in general. Use Hall’s theorem/rook polynomials/LLL for existence (sufficient for n=1) or omit counts.

- General bipartite template: If B is a k-regular bipartite graph on (E,F) with a proper k-edge-coloring and every two vertices of E have a common neighbor in F, then defining f_i(x) as the neighbor of x in color i yields pointwise distinctness, |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all i,z (n=1), and G complete. Projective planes are a canonical example with |E|=k^2−k+1.

To do: formalize Hall/rook-polynomial arguments for pinned completions (r≥2); explore bounds under surjectivity/balanced-fibre constraints.

Upper bounds under strong regularity; scope cautions

- Bijection regime (all fibres 1): If each f_i is a bijection E→F and G is complete, then |E|=|F|=:m satisfies m≤k^2−k+1. Equality holds for projective planes PG(2,q), giving m=k^2−k+1 with n=1. Thus the plane construction is optimal under maximal regularity.
- Uniform r-to-1 regime: If for all i,z we have |f_i^{-1}(z)|=r (so |E|=r|F|) and G is complete, then |E|≤kr(kr−1)+1 by double counting shared images.
- Many small fibres per z (≥r indices): Using r forbidden permutation matchings and van der Waerden’s bound, one obtains a factorial-sized core E_0(r) with G complete and n=1.

Cautions
- The fixed-transversal upper bound |E|≤D_k+kn is sharp within the permutation template when the k capped cells form a bijection τ:F→[k]; it is not claimed in general when witness indices t(z) repeat rows.
- “Pinned completions” through a prescribed forbidden cell lack a simple uniform degree structure; quantitative bounds must use Hall’s theorem, rook polynomials, or LLL. Existence for n=1 suffices for current purposes.
- In the permutation construction, the surjectivity of each f_i holds as stated when τ=id (after renaming indices); otherwise omit surjectivity.

Next: Prove existence (without counts) for pinned completions via Hall; explore near-tight constructions for r>1 in the uniform-fibres regime; and survey symmetric designs beyond planes for additional k.

# Main Results



Counterexamples to the k-function partition conjecture
- For every k≥3 and every integer n with 1≤n≤D_{k-1}, there exist functions f_1,…,f_k:E→[k] with pointwise distinct outputs and parameter n*=n such that the associated conflict graph is complete with χ(G)=|E|=D_k+kn. In particular, for k=3 and n=1 one gets χ=5>2n+1=3.
- For infinitely many k (k=q+1 with q a prime power), there exist functions with the stronger property |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all z and all i, yet the conflict graph is complete on k^2−k+1 vertices, so χ(G)=k^2−k+1>2·1+1.
These show the proposed bound 2n+1 fails dramatically for k≥3, even when n=1 and under strong fibre-regularity conditions.

Additional main result (many small fibres per value): For any k≥3 and integer r with 1≤r≤k−1, there exist functions f_1,…,f_k:E→[k] with pointwise distinct outputs such that for every z, at least r indices t satisfy |f_t^{-1}(z)|=0 (hence the hypothesis holds with n=1), while the associated conflict graph is complete with χ(G)≥((1−r/k)^k)k!≈e^{−r}k!. Thus even strong variants requiring many small fibres per z admit factorial-size counterexamples at n=1.

Optimality under bijective fibres: If each f_i is a bijection (|f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all i,z) and the conflict graph is complete, then |E|≤k^2−k+1. Projective planes PG(2,q) (k=q+1) attain equality with |E|=k^2−k+1 and n=1. Thus the projective-plane family is optimal under maximal regularity.


=== Verifier Summary ===

We validated: (1) permutation-based counterexamples with n*=n and χ=|D_k|+kn (complete G), giving factorial χ already for n=1; (2) a robust family with ≥r small fibres per z via van der Waerden, yielding |E|≥((1−r/k)^k)k! and complete G at n=1; (3) a tight bijective-regime upper bound m≤k^2−k+1, attained by projective planes (all fibres 1), and its r-to-1 analogue v≤kr(kr−1)+1. We flagged the incorrect pinned-completions count and a surjectivity claim relying on τ=id. Proofs for these results were appended; output now records the bijective optimality.

# Rigorous Proofs



Setup and notation
Let k≥3. Given functions f_1,…,f_k:E→F with pointwise distinct outputs, define the conflict graph G on E by joining x≠y if ∃ p≠q with f_p(x)=f_q(y).
For a set of functions, define n*:=max_{z∈F} min_{t∈[k]} |f_t^{-1}(z)|.

Lemma 1 (Permutation template yields complete G).
Let F=[k], let E⊆S_k, and define f_i(π)=π(i). Then the conflict graph on E is complete.
Proof. For π≠σ∈E, the permutations π^{-1} and σ^{-1} differ, so choose s with π^{-1}(s)≠σ^{-1}(s). Set p:=π^{-1}(s) and q:=σ^{-1}(s). Then p≠q and f_p(π)=π(p)=s=σ(q)=f_q(σ), so π and σ are adjacent. ∎

Theorem 2 (Strong counterexamples with prescribed n).
Fix k≥3 and an integer n with 1≤n≤D_{k-1} (where D_m is the number of derangements of [m]). There exist functions f_1,…,f_k:E→[k] with pointwise distinct outputs such that n*=n and the conflict graph is complete with
χ(G)=|E|=D_k + kn.
Proof. Let E_0 be the set of derangements of [k], |E_0|=D_k. For each s∈[k], choose a set E_s of n permutations that fix s and have no other fixed points; this is possible since there are D_{k-1} such permutations for each s. Define E:=E_0 ∪ (⋃_{s=1}^k E_s) and f_i(π):=π(i).
Pointwise distinctness holds because each π is a permutation. For each z=s, consider t=s. Then f_s^{-1}(s)=E_s, so |f_s^{-1}(s)|=n, hence min_{t}|f_t^{-1}(s)|≤n. Taking max over s gives n*≤n, while clearly n*≥n since for each s we have |f_s^{-1}(s)|=n. Thus n*=n. By Lemma 1 the conflict graph on E is complete, so χ(G)=|E|=D_k+kn. ∎

Corollary 3 (Explicit k=3, n=1 counterexample).
For k=3, take E_0={(1 2 3),(1 3 2)} and E_1={ (2 3), (1 3), (1 2) }. With f_i(π)=π(i), we have n*=1 and G=K_5, so 5 parts are needed although 2n*+1=3.

Theorem 4 (Projective-plane family: all fibres size 1 and complete G).
Let q be a prime power and set k:=q+1. Let PG(2,q) have point set F and line set E, each of size q^2+q+1=k^2−k+1. Consider the incidence bipartite graph between F and E (each vertex has degree k). Properly edge-color this bipartite k-regular graph with k colors (by Kőnig’s line-coloring theorem). For i∈[k] and L∈E define f_i(L) to be the unique point z∈F such that the incidence edge (z,L) has color i.
Then for every z∈F and every i we have |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1, and for any distinct L,M∈E, the conflict graph has L adjacent to M. Consequently G is complete on |E|=k^2−k+1 vertices and χ(G)=k^2−k+1 with n*=1.
Proof. At each vertex the k incident edges receive distinct colors among [k], so for fixed z and i there is exactly one L with color i at (z,L), giving |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1. For distinct lines L≠M, they meet in a unique point z; the two edges (z,L) and (z,M) receive distinct colors p≠q, hence f_p(L)=z=f_q(M), so L and M are adjacent. ∎

Proposition (Fixed-transversal optimality within the permutation template).
Let k≥3, F=[k], and f_i(π)=π(i) on E⊆S_k. Fix a bijection τ:F→[k]. Suppose that for every z∈F we have N_z:=|{π∈E: π(τ(z))=z}|≤n. Then |E|≤D_k+kn. Moreover, equality holds for E=D_k ∪ (⋃_{z} U_z), where each U_z consists of n permutations with exactly one fixed point at z.
Proof. Let E_0 be the set of π∈E with π(τ(z))≠z for all z. The map π↦π∘τ is a bijection S_k→S_k sending E_0 to the usual derangements; hence |E_0|≤D_k. Let B:=E\E_0. For π∈B, pick the smallest z (in a fixed total order on F) with π(τ(z))=z, and assign π to z. This assignment is injective into a multiset of size at most N_z per z, so |B|≤∑_z N_z≤kn. Thus |E|=|E_0|+|B|≤D_k+kn. The explicit construction shows equality is attainable. ∎

Lemma (Factorial core avoiding r forbidden matchings).
Let 1≤r≤k−1. Let B be the union of r permutation matrices in [k]×[k], and let A be the 0–1 complement. Then each row/column sum of A is d:=k−r, and per(A)≥d^k·(k!/k^k)=((1−r/k)^k)k!. Hence there exists E_0(r)⊆S_k with |E_0(r)|≥((1−r/k)^k)k! such that π(i) avoids the r forbidden columns for every i.
Proof. Normalize B:=A/d to obtain a doubly stochastic matrix. By Egorychev–Falikman, per(B)≥k!/k^k. Therefore per(A)=d^k per(B)≥d^k·(k!/k^k). ∎

Corollary (Counterexamples with ≥r small fibres per z at n=1).
With F=[k], E=E_0(r), f_i(π)=π(i): for each z there are r indices t with f_t^{-1}(z)=∅, so the strengthened hypothesis (≥r small fibres per z) holds for n=1. By completeness of the permutation template, G is complete and χ(G)=|E|≥((1−r/k)^k)k!.

Lemma (General bipartite template for n=1 with all fibres 1).
Let B be a k-regular bipartite graph with parts (E,F) and a proper k-edge-coloring with colors [k]. Define f_i(x) as the unique neighbor of x in color i. Then for all x∈E the values f_1(x),…,f_k(x) are distinct; for all z∈F and i, |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1. If every two vertices of E have a common neighbor in F, then the conflict graph on E is complete. Hence χ(G)=|E|. Projective planes PG(2,q) realize this with |E|=k^2−k+1.
Proof. Edge-coloring gives distinct colors around each vertex and a perfect matching per color; thus |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1. If x≠y share z, denote by p (resp. q) the color of (x,z) (resp. (y,z)). Since the coloring is proper at z, p≠q and f_p(x)=z=f_q(y), giving adjacency; hence G is complete. ∎

Theorem (Stronger linear coefficient lower bound).
Let c(k) be such that for all instances with k functions, \chi(G) \le c(k)\,n^*. Then c(k)\ge D_k+k, where D_k is the derangement number. 
Proof. Use the permutation construction with E = D_k \cup (\cup_{z\in[k]} U_z), where each U_z consists of one permutation with exactly one fixed point at z. Then n^*=1 and G is complete with \chi(G)=|E|=D_k+k, so c(k)\ge \chi(G)/n^* = D_k+k. ∎

Theorem (Bijection regime: tight upper bound).
Assume |E|=|F|=:m and for each i, f_i:E→F is a bijection (equivalently, |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all i,z). If the conflict graph G on E is complete, then m ≤ k^2−k+1. Equality is attained by projective planes PG(2,q) with k=q+1 and m=q^2+q+1.
Proof. Write σ_i:=f_i and D:=\{σ_q^{-1}σ_p: p\ne q\}. Completeness means: for all x\ne y in E, ∃ p\ne q with σ_q^{-1}σ_p(x)=y. Thus every ordered pair (x,y), x\ne y, is in the graph of some δ∈D. Since each δ is a bijection, it contributes exactly m ordered pairs (x,δ(x)). Therefore m(m−1) ≤ |D|·m ≤ k(k−1)·m, i.e., m ≤ k^2−k+1. For PG(2,q), define f_i via a proper k-edge-coloring of the incidence graph; each f_i is a bijection and any two lines meet in one point with distinct colors, so G is K_m with m=q^2+q+1, achieving equality. ∎

Proposition (Uniform r-to-1 fibres: quadratic bound).
Suppose for some r≥1 and all i,z we have |f_i^{-1}(z)|=r. Then with v:=|E|=r|F|, if G is complete, one has v ≤ kr(kr−1)+1.
Proof. For z∈F let c_z:=|\{x∈E: z∈\{f_1(x),…,f_k(x)\}\}|. Pointwise distinctness implies that for fixed z the r preimages per color are disjoint across colors, so c_z=kr for all z. Double count pairs (x,y) with x\ne y which share some z∈F: on one hand, \sum_z C(c_z,2) = |F|·C(kr,2) = (v/r)·kr(kr−1)/2. On the other hand, completeness gives at least C(v,2). Hence (v/r)·kr(kr−1)/2 ≥ v(v−1)/2, yielding v ≤ kr(kr−1)+1. For r=1 this recovers the bijective bound. ∎

# Main Results



Counterexamples to the k-function partition conjecture
- For every k≥3 and every integer n with 1≤n≤D_{k-1}, there exist functions f_1,…,f_k:E→[k] with pointwise distinct outputs and parameter n*=n such that the associated conflict graph is complete with χ(G)=|E|=D_k+kn. In particular, for k=3 and n=1 one gets χ=5>2n+1=3.
- For infinitely many k (k=q+1 with q a prime power), there exist functions with the stronger property |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all z and all i, yet the conflict graph is complete on k^2−k+1 vertices, so χ(G)=k^2−k+1>2·1+1.
These show the proposed bound 2n+1 fails dramatically for k≥3, even when n=1 and under strong fibre-regularity conditions.

Additional main result (many small fibres per value): For any k≥3 and integer r with 1≤r≤k−1, there exist functions f_1,…,f_k:E→[k] with pointwise distinct outputs such that for every z, at least r indices t satisfy |f_t^{-1}(z)|=0 (hence the hypothesis holds with n=1), while the associated conflict graph is complete with χ(G)≥((1−r/k)^k)k!≈e^{−r}k!. Thus even strong variants requiring many small fibres per z admit factorial-size counterexamples at n=1.

Optimality under bijective fibres: If each f_i is a bijection (|f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all i,z) and the conflict graph is complete, then |E|≤k^2−k+1. Projective planes PG(2,q) (k=q+1) attain equality with |E|=k^2−k+1 and n=1. Thus the projective-plane family is optimal under maximal regularity.

\title{A Sharp Linear Lower Bound in the Multi-Function Partition Problem}
\author{}
\date{}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We consider $k\ge2$ functions $f_1,\dots,f_k:E\to F$ with pointwise distinct outputs and the associated \emph{conflict graph} $G$ on $E$, where $xy$ is an edge iff there exist $p\ne q$ with $f_p(x)=f_q(y)$. Let
\[
n^{*} \;:=\; \max_{z\in F}\ \min_{t\in[k]} |f_t^{-1}(z)|
\]
be the intrinsic fibre parameter. We prove that any general linear upper bound of the form
$\chi(G)\le c(k)\,n^{*}$ (valid for all such instances with $k$ functions) must satisfy $c(k)\ge k$ for every $k\ge2$.
The proof uses a permutation construction with $\chi(G)=k!$ and $n^{*}=(k-1)!$.
\end{abstract}

\section{Setup}
Let $k\ge2$ and $f_1,\dots,f_k:E\to F$ satisfy \emph{pointwise distinctness}:
\[
\forall x\in E,\ \ \text{the values } f_1(x),\dots,f_k(x)\ \text{are pairwise distinct}.
\]
Define the \emph{conflict graph} $G$ on vertex set $E$ by joining distinct $x,y\in E$ whenever
\begin{equation}\label{eq:conflict}
\exists\, p\ne q\in[k]\ \ \text{such that}\ \ f_p(x)=f_q(y).
\end{equation}
A partition $E=\bigsqcup_i E_i$ has the property that $f_p(E_i)\cap f_q(E_i)=\varnothing$ for all $p\ne q$ if and only if each $E_i$ is a stable set in $G$; hence the minimum number of parts equals $\chi(G)$.

We measure the ``size'' of fibres by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:nstar}
n^{*} \;:=\; \max_{z\in F}\ \min_{t\in[k]} |f_t^{-1}(z)|,
\end{equation}
the smallest integer $n$ for which the hypothesis ``$\forall z\ \exists t$ with $|f_t^{-1}(z)|\le n$'' holds.

\section{A permutation construction}
Let $E=S_k$ be the set of all permutations of $[k]=\{1,\dots,k\}$, take $F=[k]$, and define
\begin{equation}\label{eq:perm}
f_i(\pi)\ :=\ \pi(i)\qquad(\pi\in S_k,\ i\in[k]).
\end{equation}
Pointwise distinctness holds since $\{\pi(1),\dots,\pi(k)\}=[k]$ for each $\pi$.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:complete}
For the instance \eqref{eq:perm}, the conflict graph $G$ is complete on $|E|=k!$ vertices.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $\pi\ne\sigma\in S_k$. Choose a symbol $s\in[k]$ such that $\pi^{-1}(s)\ne\sigma^{-1}(s)$ (some symbol moves position).
Then with $p:=\pi^{-1}(s)$ and $q:=\sigma^{-1}(s)$ we have $p\ne q$ and
\[
f_p(\pi)=\pi(p)=s=\sigma(q)=f_q(\sigma).
\]
By \eqref{eq:conflict}, $\pi$ and $\sigma$ are adjacent. Hence every pair is adjacent and $G$ is complete.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:nstar}
For the instance \eqref{eq:perm}, for every $z\in[k]$ and $i\in[k]$ the fibre size $|f_i^{-1}(z)|=(k-1)!$. Consequently $n^*=(k-1)!$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Fix $i$ and $z$. The constraint $f_i(\pi)=z$ is $\pi(i)=z$. The remaining $k-1$ positions can be permuted arbitrarily, giving $(k-1)!$ permutations. For fixed $z$, the minimum of $|f_i^{-1}(z)|$ over $i$ is therefore $(k-1)!$, and taking the maximum over $z$ yields $n^{*}=(k-1)!$.
\end{proof}

Combining Lemmas~\ref{lem:complete} and \ref{lem:nstar} we obtain
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ratio}
\chi(G) \ =\ k!\ =\ k\cdot (k-1)!\ =\ k\,n^{*} .
\end{equation}

\section{Main lower bound}
\begin{theorem}[Sharp linear lower bound]\label{thm:ck}
Let $c:\{2,3,\dots\}\to\mathbb{R}_{\ge0}$ be any function with the property that \emph{for every} instance of $k$ functions as above, the associated conflict graph $G$ satisfies
\[
\chi(G)\ \le\ c(k)\,n^{*}.
\]
Then necessarily $c(k)\ge k$ for every $k\ge2$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Apply the assumed bound to the permutation instance \eqref{eq:perm}. By \eqref{eq:ratio} we have $\chi(G)=k\,n^{*}$, hence
\[
k\,n^{*} \ =\ \chi(G)\ \le\ c(k)\,n^{*}.
\]
Since $n^{*}>0$, it follows that $c(k)\ge k$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
The proof is purely extremal and shows that the linear coefficient in any universal bound of the form $\chi(G)\le c(k)\,n^{*}$ cannot be smaller than $k$. In particular, no bound independent of $k$ is possible, and any attempt to use a constant $<k$ fails already on the permutation family.
\end{remark}
