We recast the partition problem as coloring the conflict graph G (vertices E; edge x–y iff ∃ p≠q with f_p(x)=f_q(y)), so required parts = χ(G). Main outcomes: (i) permutation template f_i(π)=π(i) on E⊆S_k gives complete G with n*=(k−1)! and χ=k! (hence χ=k·n*, so any universal linear bound χ≤c(k)n* requires c(k)≥k); (ii) derangement-based variant E=D_k ∪ ⋃_s E_s yields prescribed n with complete G and χ=D_k+kn (e.g. k=3,n=1 → K5); (iii) projective-plane template (k=q+1) yields |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 ∀i,z but G complete on k^2−k+1 vertices (n*=1 yet χ≫2n+1). Extensions: factorial-size cores E_0(r) avoiding r forbidden matchings give |E_0(r)|≥((1−r/k)^k)k! (via van der Waerden), so strengthened small-fibre hypotheses still admit factorial χ. Caveat: the bound m≤k^2−k+1 holds in the bijection regime (all fibres 1) and is tight (projective planes), but is false in general. Citations: papers/paper1.txt
