  "feedback_md": "Excellent progress. We now have two rigorous, complementary families of strong counterexamples and several clean structural lemmas.\n\nSound results and highlights:\n- Permutation template f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i) on E\u2286S_k: completeness of the conflict graph is correct. The \u201cderangements + single-fixed-point per column\u201d construction yields n*=n and \u03c7(G)=|D_k|+kn; the explicit k=3, n=1 K5 instance is valid. The fixed-transversal (bijective \u03c4) upper bound |E|\u2264D_k+kn with equality is correct and tightly framed within its scope.\n- Many-small-fibres variant (\u2265r indices per z): the van der Waerden permanent bound is correctly applied to obtain |E_0(r)|\u2265((1\u2212r/k)^k)k!\u2248e^{\u2212r}k!, and hence factorial \u03c7 at n=1, with G complete.\n- Finite-geometry/designs: the bipartite-incidence template is correct; for projective planes (and more generally symmetric designs) all fibres equal 1 and G is complete. The new bijective-regime quadratic ceiling m\u2264k^2\u2212k+1 (tight for projective planes) is a key optimality result under maximal regularity. The r-to-1 uniform-fibre generalization v\u2264kr(kr\u22121)+1 via double counting is also correct.\n\nIssues to fix/avoid:\n- \u201cPinned completions\u201d (choose a fixed forbidden cell and avoid all others): the residual matrix is not regular; the stated uniform (k\u2212r\u22121)/(k\u22121) lower bound is unjustified. Use existence via Hall\u2019s theorem or defer quantitative counts (rook polynomials/LLL) unless a correct bound is proved.\n- Proposition 1 (surjectivity of each f_i): as written it relies on \u03c4=id. Either set \u03c4=id (by renaming indices consistently) or drop surjectivity; it is not needed for the counterexample.\n- Do not generalize the D_k+kn upper bound beyond the fixed-transversal (bijective \u03c4) setting; the hypothesis \u201c\u2203t(z)\u201d does not imply a bijection over z.\n\nConcrete next steps:\n- Add rigorous proofs to proofs.md (now appended): (i) the bijective-regime upper bound m\u2264k^2\u2212k+1 (tight via PG(2,q)); (ii) the r-to-1 extension; (iii) the stronger linear coefficient lower bound c(k)\u2265D_k+k via the n*=1 permutation construction.\n- For the \u2265r small-fibres variant with n=1, keep the van der Waerden core; if needed, add Hall-based existence for pinned completions without counts.\n- Explore bounds and constructions under added regularity (all f_i surjective; balanced fibres). The bijective bound suggests \u0398(k^2) is optimal at r=1; quantify best-possible growth for r>1.\n",

Then c(k)\\ge D_k+k, where D_k is the derangement number. \nProof. Use the permutation construction with E = D_k \\cup (\\cup_{z\\in[k]} U_z), where each U_z consists of one permutation with exactly one fixed point at z. Then n^*=1 and G is complete with \\chi(G)=|E|=D_k+k, so c(k)\\ge \\chi(G)/n^* = D_k+k. \u220e\n\nTheorem (Bijection regime: tight upper bound).\nAssume |E|=|F|=:m and for each i, f_i:E\u2192F is a bijection (equivalently, |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all i,z). If the conflict graph G on E is complete, then m \u2264 k^2\u2212k+1. Equality is attained by projective planes PG(2,q) with k=q+1 and m=q^2+q+1.\nProof. Write \u03c3_i:=f_i and D:=\\{\u03c3_q^{-1}\u03c3_p: p\\ne q\\}. Completeness means: for all x\\ne y in E, \u2203 p\\ne q with \u03c3_q^{-1}\u03c3_p(x)=y. Thus every ordered pair (x,y), x\\ne y, is in the graph of some \u03b4\u2208D. Since each \u03b4 is a bijection, it contributes exactly m ordered pairs (x,\u03b4(x)). Therefore m(m\u22121) \u2264 |D|\u00b7m \u2264 k(k\u22121)\u00b7m, i.e., m \u2264 k^2\u2212k+1. For PG(2,q), define f_i via a proper k-edge-coloring of the incidence graph; each f_i is a bijection and any two lines meet in one point with distinct colors, so G is K_m with m=q^2+q+1, achieving equality. \u220e\n\nProposition (Uniform r-to-1 fibres: quadratic bound).\nSuppose for some r\u22651 and all i,z we have |f_i^{-1}(z)|=r. Then with v:=|E|=r|F|, if G is complete, one has v \u2264 kr(kr\u22121)+1.\nProof. For z\u2208F let c_z:=|\\{x\u2208E: z\u2208\\{f_1(x),\u2026,f_k(x)\\}\\}|. Pointwise distinctness implies that for fixed z the r preimages per color are disjoint across colors, so c_z=kr for all z. Double count pairs (x,y) with x\\ne y which share some z\u2208F: on one hand, \\sum_z C(c_z,2) = |F|\u00b7C(kr,2) = (v/r)\u00b7kr(kr\u22121)/2. On the other hand, completeness gives at least C(v,2). Hence (v/r)\u00b7kr(kr\u22121)/2 \u2265 v(v\u22121)/2, yielding v \u2264 kr(kr\u22121)+1. For r=1 this recovers the bijective bound. \u220e"
