The \u201cderangements + single-fixed-point per column\u201d construction yields n*=n and \u03c7(G)=|D_k|+kn; the explicit k=3, n=1 K5 instance is valid. The fixed-transversal (bijective \u03c4) upper bound |E|\u2264D_k+kn with equality is correct and tightly framed within its scope.\\n- Many-small-fibres variant (\u2265r indices per z): the van der Waerden permanent bound is correctly applied to obtain |E_0(r)|\u2265((1\u2212r/k)^k)k!\u2248e^{\u2212r}k!, and hence factorial \u03c7 at n=1, with G complete.\\n- Finite-geometry/designs: the bipartite-incidence template is correct; for projective planes (and more generally symmetric designs) all fibres equal 1 and G is complete. The new bijective-regime quadratic ceiling m\u2264k^2\u2212k+1 (tight for projective planes) is a key optimality result under maximal regularity.
