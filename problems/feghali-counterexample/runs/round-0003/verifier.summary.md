We validated: (1) permutation-based counterexamples with n*=n and χ=|D_k|+kn (complete G), giving factorial χ already for n=1; (2) a robust family with ≥r small fibres per z via van der Waerden, yielding |E|≥((1−r/k)^k)k! and complete G at n=1; (3) a tight bijective-regime upper bound m≤k^2−k+1, attained by projective planes (all fibres 1), and its r-to-1 analogue v≤kr(kr−1)+1. We flagged the incorrect pinned-completions count and a surjectivity claim relying on τ=id. Proofs for these results were appended; output now records the bijective optimality.
