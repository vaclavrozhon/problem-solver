{"feedback_md":"Excellent progress. We now have two rigorous, complementary families of strong counterexamples and several clean structural lemmas.\n\nSound results and highlights:\n- Permutation template f_i(π)=π(i) on E⊆S_k: completeness of the conflict graph is correct. The “derangements + single-fixed-point per column” construction yields n*=n and χ(G)=|D_k|+kn; the explicit k=3, n=1 K5 instance is valid. The fixed-transversal (bijective τ) upper bound |E|≤D_k+kn with equality is correct and tightly framed within its scope.\n- Many-small-fibres variant (≥r indices per z): the van der Waerden permanent bound is correctly applied to obtain |E_0(r)|≥((1−r/k)^k)k!≈e^{−r}k!, and hence factorial χ at n=1, with G complete.\n- Finite-geometry/designs: the bipartite-incidence template is correct; for projective planes (and more generally symmetric designs) all fibres equal 1 and G is complete. The new bijective-regime quadratic ceiling m≤k^2−k+1 (tight for projective planes) is a key optimality result under maximal regularity. The r-to-1 uniform-fibre generalization v≤kr(kr−1)+1 via double counting is also correct.\n\nIssues to fix/avoid:\n- “Pinned completions” (choose a fixed forbidden cell and avoid all others): the residual matrix is not regular; the stated uniform (k−r−1)/(k−1) lower bound is unjustified. Use existence via Hall’s theorem or defer quantitative counts (rook polynomials/LLL) unless a correct bound is proved.\n- Proposition 1 (surjectivity of each f_i): as written it relies on τ=id. Either set τ=id (by renaming indices consistently) or drop surjectivity; it is not needed for the counterexample.\n- Do not generalize the D_k+kn upper bound beyond the fixed-transversal (bijective τ) setting; the hypothesis “∃t(z)” does not imply a bijection over z.\n\nConcrete next steps:\n- Add rigorous proofs to proofs.md (now appended): (i) the bijective-regime upper bound m≤k^2−k+1 (tight via PG(2,q)); (ii) the r-to-1 extension; (iii) the stronger linear coefficient lower bound c(k)≥D_k+k via the n*=1 permutation construction.\n- For the ≥r small-fibres variant with n=1, keep the van der Waerden core; if needed, add Hall-based existence for pinned completions without counts.\n- Explore bounds and constructions under added regularity (all f_i surjective; balanced fibres).

Then c(k)\\ge D_k+k, where D_k is the derangement number. \nProof. Use the permutation construction with E = D_k \\cup (\\cup_{z\\in[k]} U_z), where each U_z consists of one permutation with exactly one fixed point at z. Then n^*=1 and G is complete with \\chi(G)=|E|=D_k+k, so c(k)\\ge \\chi(G)/n^* = D_k+k. ∎\n\nTheorem (Bijection regime: tight upper bound).\nAssume |E|=|F|=:m and for each i, f_i:E→F is a bijection (equivalently, |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all i,z). If the conflict graph G on E is complete, then m ≤ k^2−k+1. Equality is attained by projective planes PG(2,q) with k=q+1 and m=q^2+q+1.\nProof. Write σ_i:=f_i and D:=\\{σ_q^{-1}σ_p: p\\ne q\\}. Completeness means: for all x\\ne y in E, ∃ p\\ne q with σ_q^{-1}σ_p(x)=y. Thus every ordered pair (x,y), x\\ne y, is in the graph of some δ∈D. Since each δ is a bijection, it contributes exactly m ordered pairs (x,δ(x)). Therefore m(m−1) ≤ |D|·m ≤ k(k−1)·m, i.e., m ≤ k^2−k+1. For PG(2,q), define f_i via a proper k-edge-coloring of the incidence graph; each f_i is a bijection and any two lines meet in one point with distinct colors, so G is K_m with m=q^2+q+1, achieving equality. ∎\n\nProposition (Uniform r-to-1 fibres: quadratic bound).\nSuppose for some r≥1 and all i,z we have |f_i^{-1}(z)|=r. Then with v:=|E|=r|F|, if G is complete, one has v ≤ kr(kr−1)+1.\nProof. For z∈F let c_z:=|\\{x∈E: z∈\\{f_1(x),…,f_k(x)\\}\\}|. Pointwise distinctness implies that for fixed z the r preimages per color are disjoint across colors, so c_z=kr for all z. Double count pairs (x,y) with x\\ne y which share some z∈F: on one hand, \\sum_z C(c_z,2) = |F|·C(kr,2) = (v/r)·kr(kr−1)/2. On the other hand, completeness gives at least C(v,2). Hence (v/r)·kr(kr−1)/2 ≥ v(v−1)/2, yielding v ≤ kr(kr−1)+1. For r=1 this recovers the bijective bound. ∎"},"output_update":{"action":"append","content":"Optimality under bijective fibres: If each f_i is a bijection (|f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all i,z) and the conflict graph is complete, then |E|≤k^2−k+1.
