# Main Results



Counterexamples to the k-function partition conjecture
- For every k≥3 and every integer n with 1≤n≤D_{k-1}, there exist functions f_1,…,f_k:E→[k] with pointwise distinct outputs and parameter n*=n such that the associated conflict graph is complete with χ(G)=|E|=D_k+kn. In particular, for k=3 and n=1 one gets χ=5>2n+1=3.
- For infinitely many k (k=q+1 with q a prime power), there exist functions with the stronger property |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all z and all i, yet the conflict graph is complete on k^2−k+1 vertices, so χ(G)=k^2−k+1>2·1+1.
These show the proposed bound 2n+1 fails dramatically for k≥3, even when n=1 and under strong fibre-regularity conditions.

Additional main result (many small fibres per value): For any k≥3 and integer r with 1≤r≤k−1, there exist functions f_1,…,f_k:E→[k] with pointwise distinct outputs such that for every z, at least r indices t satisfy |f_t^{-1}(z)|=0 (hence the hypothesis holds with n=1), while the associated conflict graph is complete with χ(G)≥((1−r/k)^k)k!≈e^{−r}k!. Thus even strong variants requiring many small fibres per z admit factorial-size counterexamples at n=1.

Optimality under bijective fibres: If each f_i is a bijection (|f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all i,z) and the conflict graph is complete, then |E|≤k^2−k+1. Projective planes PG(2,q) (k=q+1) attain equality with |E|=k^2−k+1 and n=1. Thus the projective-plane family is optimal under maximal regularity.
