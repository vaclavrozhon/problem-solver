  "content": "Ideas\n- Push counterexamples under three increasingly strong hypotheses on fibres: (i) original \u201c\u2203t per z\u201d with prescribed n; (ii) \u201c\u2265 r small indices per z\u201d with n=1; (iii) all fibres equal 1 (bijective regime). In all three, force the conflict graph G to be complete, so the required number of parts equals |E|, which we make as large as possible.\n\nSetup and notation\n- Conflict graph G on E: x\u2013y an edge iff \u2203 p\u2260q with f_p(x)=f_q(y). Partitions with fp(Ei)\u2229fq(Ei)=\u2205 correspond to proper colorings; #parts = \u03c7(G).\n- For z\u2208F let n*(instance) := max_z min_t |f_t^{-1}(z)|.\n- Let D_k be the number of derangements in S_k.\n\nProposition A (Permutation template with prescribed n; complete graph; optimal within a fixed transversal)\nLet k\u22653, F=[k], fix a bijection \u03c4:F\u2192[k]. Define functions on permutations by f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i).\nConstruction:\n- E_0 := {\u03c0\u2208S_k : \u03c0(\u03c4(z))\u2260z for all z} has size D_k.\n- For each z, let U_z be any set of n permutations with \u03c0(\u03c4(z))=z and \u03c0(\u03c4(z\u2032))\u2260z\u2032 for all z\u2032\u2260z. There are D_{k-1} such permutations per z, so feasible for 1\u2264n\u2264D_{k-1}.\n- Let E := E_0 \u2294 (\u22c3_{z\u2208F} U_z).\nClaims:\n1) Pointwise distinctness holds (permutations). 2) For each z, |f_{\u03c4(z)}^{-1}(z)|=n, hence n*=n. 3) G is complete for any E\u2286S_k: if \u03c0\u2260\u03c3, pick s with \u03c0^{-1}(s)\u2260\u03c3^{-1}(s), then f_{\u03c0^{-1}(s)}(\u03c0)=s=f_{\u03c3^{-1}(s)}(\u03c3) with different indices. 4) \u03c7(G)=|E|=D_k+kn.\nOptimality within fixed \u03c4: If E\u2286S_k satisfies |{\u03c0\u2208E: \u03c0(\u03c4(z))=z}|\u2264n for all z, then writing B:=E\\E_0, every \u03c0\u2208B hits at least one cell (\u03c4(z),z). Assign each \u03c0\u2208B to the least such z; this is an injection into \u22c3_z of n slots. Hence |E|\u2264D_k+kn. Our construction attains equality.\nConsequence (coefficient lower bound): If a universal bound \u03c7(G)\u2264c(k)\u00b7n* held for all instances, applying it here with n*=1 yields c(k)\u2265\u03c7(G)=D_k+k\u2248(1/e)k!.\n\nProposition B (Many small fibres per value; factorial \u03c7 at n=1)\nLet 1\u2264r\u2264k\u22121. Choose r bijections \u03c4_1,\u2026,\u03c4_r:F\u2192[k]; define the forbidden set of cells B:=\u22c3_{j=1}^r {(\u03c4_j(z),z): z\u2208F}, and let A be its 0\u20131 complement in the k\u00d7k grid. Define E_0(r):={\u03c0\u2208S_k: (i,\u03c0(i))\u2208A for all i}. Set f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i).\nClaims:\n- For every z, the r indices {\u03c4_j(z)} satisfy |f_{\u03c4_j(z)}^{-1}(z)|=0; thus the hypothesis holds with n=1 and even \u201c\u2265 r small indices per z\u201d.\n- G is complete (as above).\n- Lower bound: A has row/column sums s:=k\u2212r. Normalize B:=A/s to be doubly stochastic. By van der Waerden, perm(A)=|E_0(r)|\u2265 s^k\u00b7(k!/k^k)=k!\u00b7(1\u2212r/k)^k\u2248e^{\u2212r}k!.\nHence \u03c7(G)=|E_0(r)| is factorial in k already at n=1, even under the stronger \u201c\u2265 r small fibres per z\u201d.\n\nLemma C (Incidence-design template; uniform fibres = 1; complete G)\nLet (F,E,\u2110) be a symmetric 2-(v,k,\u03bb) design (v=b, each block size k, each point replicated k times). The incidence bipartite graph is k-regular, so admits a proper k-edge-coloring (K\u0151nig). For i\u2208[k], define f_i(x) as the unique point z\u2208F incident with block x in color i. Then: (i) pointwise distinctness holds on each x; (ii) |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all i,z; (iii) any two blocks meet in \u03bb\u22651 points, and the two colors used at a common point are distinct, hence G is complete on |E|=v.\nExample: The projective plane PG(2,q) (\u03bb=1, k=q+1) yields n*=1 and \u03c7(G)=v=q^2+q+1=k^2\u2212k+1.\n\nExamples\n- k=3, n=1 (A): E={two 3-cycles}\u222a{three transpositions}; n*=1; G=K_5; \u03c7=5>2n+1.\n- k=3 (C): PG(2,2) gives |E|=7 with all fibres 1; G=K_7.\n- r=2, general k (B): \u03c7\u2265k!\u00b7(1\u22122/k)^k\u2248e^{\u22122}k! at n=1.\n\nObstacles and cautions\n- \u201cPinned completions\u201d for r\u22652 (choosing permutations with exactly one hit in B at a prescribed cell and none elsewhere) require nontrivial rook-polynomial/LLL arguments; the naive uniform-degree lower bound after deleting a row/column is false. For our purposes, the core E_0(r) already gives factorial \u03c7 at n=1 with \u2265r small indices per z.\n- The upper bound |E|\u2264D_k+kn is proven and tight only within the fixed-transversal framework (i.e., the capped cells form a bijection \u03c4:F\u2192[k]). It is not claimed in the general \u201c\u2203t(z)\u201d setting without fixing \u03c4.\n\nWhy these are strong\n- Proposition A disproves any bound of the form \u03c7\u2264c(k)\u00b7n with subfactorial c(k); indeed c(k)\u2265D_k+k.\n- Proposition B shows even strengthened hypotheses (\u201cmany small indices per value\u201d) fail badly: \u03c7 can still be \u2248e^{\u2212r}k! at n=1.\n- Lemma C shows that, under the strongest regularity (all fibres 1), \u03c7 is as large as k^2\u2212k+1, which is optimal in that regime (attained by projective planes).\n\nNext steps\n- Write a short proof note formalizing: (i) Proposition A (including the fixed-transversal optimality); (ii) Proposition B with the van der Waerden bound and completeness; (iii) Lemma C.\n- Explore quantitative pinned-completion bounds for r\u22652 via rook polynomials or the lopsided Lov\u00e1sz local lemma to extend Proposition B to prescribed n>1 while retaining factorial \u03c7.\n- Investigate upper bounds under added regularity: e.g., all f_i surjective and nearly balanced fibres; quantify maximal \u03c7 in that regime (\u0398(k^2\u00b7n)?)."
