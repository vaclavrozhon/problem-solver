Ideas
- Push counterexamples under three increasingly strong hypotheses on fibres: (i) original “∃t per z” with prescribed n; (ii) “≥ r small indices per z” with n=1; (iii) all fibres equal 1 (bijective regime). In all three, force the conflict graph G to be complete, so the required number of parts equals |E|, which we make as large as possible.

Setup and notation
- Conflict graph G on E: x–y an edge iff ∃ p≠q with f_p(x)=f_q(y). Partitions with fp(Ei)∩fq(Ei)=∅ correspond to proper colorings; #parts = χ(G).
- For z∈F let n*(instance) := max_z min_t |f_t^{-1}(z)|.
- Let D_k be the number of derangements in S_k.

Proposition A (Permutation template with prescribed n; complete graph; optimal within a fixed transversal)
Let k≥3, F=[k], fix a bijection τ:F→[k]. Define functions on permutations by f_i(π)=π(i).
Construction:
- E_0 := {π∈S_k : π(τ(z))≠z for all z} has size D_k.
- For each z, let U_z be any set of n permutations with π(τ(z))=z and π(τ(z′))≠z′ for all z′≠z. There are D_{k-1} such permutations per z, so feasible for 1≤n≤D_{k-1}.
- Let E := E_0 ⊔ (⋃_{z∈F} U_z).
Claims:
1) Pointwise distinctness holds (permutations). 2) For each z, |f_{τ(z)}^{-1}(z)|=n, hence n*=n. 3) G is complete for any E⊆S_k: if π≠σ, pick s with π^{-1}(s)≠σ^{-1}(s), then f_{π^{-1}(s)}(π)=s=f_{σ^{-1}(s)}(σ) with different indices. 4) χ(G)=|E|=D_k+kn.
Optimality within fixed τ: If E⊆S_k satisfies |{π∈E: π(τ(z))=z}|≤n for all z, then writing B:=E\E_0, every π∈B hits at least one cell (τ(z),z). Assign each π∈B to the least such z; this is an injection into ⋃_z of n slots. Hence |E|≤D_k+kn. Our construction attains equality.
Consequence (coefficient lower bound): If a universal bound χ(G)≤c(k)·n* held for all instances, applying it here with n*=1 yields c(k)≥χ(G)=D_k+k≈(1/e)k!.

Proposition B (Many small fibres per value; factorial χ at n=1)
Let 1≤r≤k−1. Choose r bijections τ_1,…,τ_r:F→[k]; define the forbidden set of cells B:=⋃_{j=1}^r {(τ_j(z),z): z∈F}, and let A be its 0–1 complement in the k×k grid. Define E_0(r):={π∈S_k: (i,π(i))∈A for all i}. Set f_i(π)=π(i).
Claims:
- For every z, the r indices {τ_j(z)} satisfy |f_{τ_j(z)}^{-1}(z)|=0; thus the hypothesis holds with n=1 and even “≥ r small indices per z”.
- G is complete (as above).
- Lower bound: A has row/column sums s:=k−r. Normalize B:=A/s to be doubly stochastic. By van der Waerden, perm(A)=|E_0(r)|≥ s^k·(k!/k^k)=k!·(1−r/k)^k≈e^{−r}k!.
Hence χ(G)=|E_0(r)| is factorial in k already at n=1, even under the stronger “≥ r small fibres per z”.

Lemma C (Incidence-design template; uniform fibres = 1; complete G)
Let (F,E,ℐ) be a symmetric 2-(v,k,λ) design (v=b, each block size k, each point replicated k times). The incidence bipartite graph is k-regular, so admits a proper k-edge-coloring (Kőnig). For i∈[k], define f_i(x) as the unique point z∈F incident with block x in color i. Then: (i) pointwise distinctness holds on each x; (ii) |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all i,z; (iii) any two blocks meet in λ≥1 points, and the two colors used at a common point are distinct, hence G is complete on |E|=v.
Example: The projective plane PG(2,q) (λ=1, k=q+1) yields n*=1 and χ(G)=v=q^2+q+1=k^2−k+1.

Examples
- k=3, n=1 (A): E={two 3-cycles}∪{three transpositions}; n*=1; G=K_5; χ=5>2n+1.
- k=3 (C): PG(2,2) gives |E|=7 with all fibres 1; G=K_7.
- r=2, general k (B): χ≥k!·(1−2/k)^k≈e^{−2}k! at n=1.

Obstacles and cautions
- “Pinned completions” for r≥2 (choosing permutations with exactly one hit in B at a prescribed cell and none elsewhere) require nontrivial rook-polynomial/LLL arguments; the naive uniform-degree lower bound after deleting a row/column is false. For our purposes, the core E_0(r) already gives factorial χ at n=1 with ≥r small indices per z.
- The upper bound |E|≤D_k+kn is proven and tight only within the fixed-transversal framework (i.e., the capped cells form a bijection τ:F→[k]). It is not claimed in the general “∃t(z)” setting without fixing τ.

Why these are strong
- Proposition A disproves any bound of the form χ≤c(k)·n with subfactorial c(k); indeed c(k)≥D_k+k.
- Proposition B shows even strengthened hypotheses (“many small indices per value”) fail badly: χ can still be ≈e^{−r}k! at n=1.
- Lemma C shows that, under the strongest regularity (all fibres 1), χ is as large as k^2−k+1, which is optimal in that regime (attained by projective planes).

Next steps
- Write a short proof note formalizing: (i) Proposition A (including the fixed-transversal optimality); (ii) Proposition B with the van der Waerden bound and completeness; (iii) Lemma C.
- Explore quantitative pinned-completion bounds for r≥2 via rook polynomials or the lopsided Lovász local lemma to extend Proposition B to prescribed n>1 while retaining factorial χ.
- Investigate upper bounds under added regularity: e.g., all f_i surjective and nearly balanced fibres; quantify maximal χ in that regime (Θ(k^2·n)?).
