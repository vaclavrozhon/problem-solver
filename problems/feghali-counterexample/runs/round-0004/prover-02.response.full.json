          "text": "{\"content\":\"Ideas\\n- We continue pursuing \u201ccomplete conflict graph\u201d instances, so the minimum number of parts equals |E|. The permutation template f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i) with E\u2286S_k and F=[k] guarantees completeness for any E, reducing the problem to maximizing |E| subject to fibre constraints.\\n- Two robust directions:\\n  1) Fixed-transversal control: choose a bijection \u03c4:[k]\u2192[k] and cap each fibre |{\u03c0\u2208E:\u03c0(\u03c4(z))=z}| by n. This yields a sharp upper bound |E|\u2264D_k+kn, with a matching construction. For n=1 this gives |E|\u2248k!/e, hence \u03c7(G)\u2248k!/e even at n*=1.\\n  2) Many-small-fibres per z: forbid r permutation matchings. The allowed matrix A is (k\u2212r)-regular bipartite; van der Waerden gives |E|\u2265((1\u2212r/k)^k)k!\u2248e^{\u2212r}k!, with \u03c7(G)=|E| and n=1 (indeed, \u2265r indices have fibre 0 at each z). This shows factorial-size counterexamples persist under stronger hypotheses.\\n\\nLemma 1 (Completeness under the permutation template)\\nLet F=[k], E\u2286S_k, and f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i). For \u03c0\u2260\u03c3, pick s with \u03c0^{-1}(s)\u2260\u03c3^{-1}(s); set p=\u03c0^{-1}(s), q=\u03c3^{-1}(s). Then f_p(\u03c0)=s=f_q(\u03c3), p\u2260q, so the conflict graph G is complete. Hence the number of parts equals \u03c7(G)=|E|.\\n\\nProposition 2 (Sharp fixed-transversal bound; optimality)\\nFix a bijection \u03c4:[k]\u2192[k]. Suppose E\u2286S_k satisfies C_z:=|{\u03c0\u2208E: \u03c0(\u03c4(z))=z}|\u2264n for all z. Then |E|\u2264D_k+kn. Equality holds for\\nE=D_k \u222a \u22c3_{z\u2208[k]} A_z,\\nwhere each A_z has n permutations with exactly one fixed point at (\u03c4(z),z). Proof: Split E=A\u222aB, where A avoids all k cells (\u03c4(z),z) and B hits at least one. Then |A|\u2264D_k. Also S:=\u2211_z C_z\u2264kn, and mapping each \u03c0\u2208B to the least z with \u03c0(\u03c4(z))=z gives |B|\u2264S\u2264kn. The construction attains equality since |A|=D_k and each \u03c0\u2208B has a unique fixed cell.\\nWhy useful: Within this regime, maximal |E| for given n is D_k+kn. For n=1, \u03c7(G)=|E|=D_k+k\u2248k!/e.\\n\\nCorollary 3 (Strong n=1 counterexamples with surjectivity of every f_i)\\nWith \u03c4=id and E as in Proposition 2 for n=1, each f_i is surjective: derangements cover all z\u2260i at row i, and the single fixed-point permutation covers z=i. By Lemma 1, G is complete, so \u03c7(G)=D_k+k. Thus at n*=1, one needs \u2248k!/e parts. Small case: k=3 gives K_5, refuting 2n+1=3.\\n\\nTheorem 4 (No subfactorial linear bound in k)\\nIf \u03c7(G)\u2264c(k)\u00b7n* held for all instances with k functions, then applying Corollary 3 (where n*=1 and \u03c7(G)=D_k+k) yields c(k)\u2265D_k+k\u2248k!/e. In particular, no bound polynomial in k (times n*) is possible.\\n\\nProposition 5 (Factorial cores under \u201c\u2265r small fibres per z\u201d via van der Waerden)\\nLet \u03c3_1,\u2026,\u03c3_r\u2208S_k, and forbid the r matchings B=\u22c3_{j=1}^r{(i,\u03c3_j(i))}. Let A be the allowed 0\u20131 k\u00d7k matrix; A is (k\u2212r)-regular bipartite. The number of permutations avoiding B equals per(A)\u2265((k\u2212r)/k)^k k!=((1\u2212r/k)^k)k!. Let E_0(r) be this set of permutations and define f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i). Then G is complete (Lemma 1), and for each z, the r indices t_j:=\u03c3_j^{-1}(z) satisfy |f_{t_j}^{-1}(z)|=0, so the strengthened hypothesis (\u2265r small fibres per z, with n=1) holds. Conclusion: \u03c7(G)=|E_0(r)|\u2265((1\u2212r/k)^k)k!\u2248e^{\u2212r}k!.\\nSketch proof: Normalize A by t=k\u2212r to a doubly-stochastic matrix; Egorychev\u2013Falikman (van der Waerden) yields per(A/t)\u2265k!/k^k, so per(A)\u2265t^k\u00b7k!/k^k.\\n\\nLemma 6 (Pinned completion existence in the forbidden-matchings model)\\nIn the setup of Proposition 5, every allowed edge (i,z) lies in a perfect matching. Hence for any (z,j) one can select a permutation \u03c0 with \u03c0(\u03c3_j^{-1}(z))=z and avoiding all other forbidden cells. Proof: A is (k\u2212r)-regular bipartite; by K\u0151nig\u2019s line-coloring theorem (edge-chromatic index equals degree) it decomposes into k\u2212r edge-disjoint perfect matchings. Thus each edge lies in some perfect matching.\\nWhy useful: Enables adding, for each (z,j), any prescribed number of \u201cpinned\u201d permutations (up to feasibility), while preserving completeness and small fibres where desired.\\n\\nDesign-based bijective regime (optimal quadratic size at n=1)\\nIf each f_i is a bijection E\u2192F, then |E|=|F|=:m. If G is complete, any two x,y\u2208E share some z\u2208F at distinct colors, so the bipartite incidence (E,F) has \u03bb=1. Fisher\u2019s inequality and standard design theory give m\u2264k^2\u2212k+1, with equality for projective planes PG(2,q) where k=q+1. This yields complete G on m=k^2\u2212k+1 with n*=1 and all fibres 1; optimal in this regime.\\n\\nExamples\\n- k=3, n=1: E=D_3\u222a{(12),(13),(23)} has |E|=5, G=K_5.\\n- k=3, bijective regime: PG(2,2) gives |E|=7, G=K_7, n*=1, each f_i bijection.\\n- General r: For fixed r and large k, E_0(r) yields \u03c7(G)\u2265(e^{\u2212r}+o(1))k! with n=1 and \u2265r small fibres per z.\\n\\nObstacles\\n- Fixed-transversal upper bound D_k+kn requires a bijection \u03c4 over columns; without this, the \u201cavoid all k cells\u201d term need not equal D_k. Our constructions all enforce such a transversal (\u03c4=id), so the bound is both applicable and tight in those instances.\\n- Quantitative counts for pinned completions beyond existence require more delicate permanent bounds for irregular 0\u20131 matrices; for our purposes, Lemma 6 (existence) suffices.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Formalize Proposition 2\u2019s proof (fixed-transversal optimality) and Theorem 4 (c(k)\u2265\u0398(k!)) for proofs.md.\\n- Record Proposition 5 with a precise citation to Egorychev\u2013Falikman and the edge-coloring decomposition justifying Lemma 6.\\n- Explore upper bounds under added regularity: e.g., if each f_i is surjective (as in Corollary 3), can \u03c7(G) exceed \u0398(k^2)? The plane shows \u0398(k^2) is achievable with bijective fibres; investigating the maximal growth under surjectivity might isolate a sharp threshold between quadratic and factorial behaviour.\\n\"}",
