Ideas
- We continue pursuing “complete conflict graph” instances, so the minimum number of parts equals |E|. The permutation template f_i(π)=π(i) with E⊆S_k and F=[k] guarantees completeness for any E, reducing the problem to maximizing |E| subject to fibre constraints.
- Two robust directions:
  1) Fixed-transversal control: choose a bijection τ:[k]→[k] and cap each fibre |{π∈E:π(τ(z))=z}| by n. This yields a sharp upper bound |E|≤D_k+kn, with a matching construction. For n=1 this gives |E|≈k!/e, hence χ(G)≈k!/e even at n*=1.
  2) Many-small-fibres per z: forbid r permutation matchings. The allowed matrix A is (k−r)-regular bipartite; van der Waerden gives |E|≥((1−r/k)^k)k!≈e^{−r}k!, with χ(G)=|E| and n=1 (indeed, ≥r indices have fibre 0 at each z). This shows factorial-size counterexamples persist under stronger hypotheses.

Lemma 1 (Completeness under the permutation template)
Let F=[k], E⊆S_k, and f_i(π)=π(i). For π≠σ, pick s with π^{-1}(s)≠σ^{-1}(s); set p=π^{-1}(s), q=σ^{-1}(s). Then f_p(π)=s=f_q(σ), p≠q, so the conflict graph G is complete. Hence the number of parts equals χ(G)=|E|.

Proposition 2 (Sharp fixed-transversal bound; optimality)
Fix a bijection τ:[k]→[k]. Suppose E⊆S_k satisfies C_z:=|{π∈E: π(τ(z))=z}|≤n for all z. Then |E|≤D_k+kn. Equality holds for
E=D_k ∪ ⋃_{z∈[k]} A_z,
where each A_z has n permutations with exactly one fixed point at (τ(z),z). Proof: Split E=A∪B, where A avoids all k cells (τ(z),z) and B hits at least one. Then |A|≤D_k. Also S:=∑_z C_z≤kn, and mapping each π∈B to the least z with π(τ(z))=z gives |B|≤S≤kn. The construction attains equality since |A|=D_k and each π∈B has a unique fixed cell.
Why useful: Within this regime, maximal |E| for given n is D_k+kn. For n=1, χ(G)=|E|=D_k+k≈k!/e.

Corollary 3 (Strong n=1 counterexamples with surjectivity of every f_i)
With τ=id and E as in Proposition 2 for n=1, each f_i is surjective: derangements cover all z≠i at row i, and the single fixed-point permutation covers z=i. By Lemma 1, G is complete, so χ(G)=D_k+k. Thus at n*=1, one needs ≈k!/e parts. Small case: k=3 gives K_5, refuting 2n+1=3.

Theorem 4 (No subfactorial linear bound in k)
If χ(G)≤c(k)·n* held for all instances with k functions, then applying Corollary 3 (where n*=1 and χ(G)=D_k+k) yields c(k)≥D_k+k≈k!/e. In particular, no bound polynomial in k (times n*) is possible.

Proposition 5 (Factorial cores under “≥r small fibres per z” via van der Waerden)
Let σ_1,…,σ_r∈S_k, and forbid the r matchings B=⋃_{j=1}^r{(i,σ_j(i))}. Let A be the allowed 0–1 k×k matrix; A is (k−r)-regular bipartite. The number of permutations avoiding B equals per(A)≥((k−r)/k)^k k!=((1−r/k)^k)k!. Let E_0(r) be this set of permutations and define f_i(π)=π(i). Then G is complete (Lemma 1), and for each z, the r indices t_j:=σ_j^{-1}(z) satisfy |f_{t_j}^{-1}(z)|=0, so the strengthened hypothesis (≥r small fibres per z, with n=1) holds. Conclusion: χ(G)=|E_0(r)|≥((1−r/k)^k)k!≈e^{−r}k!.
Sketch proof: Normalize A by t=k−r to a doubly-stochastic matrix; Egorychev–Falikman (van der Waerden) yields per(A/t)≥k!/k^k, so per(A)≥t^k·k!/k^k.

Lemma 6 (Pinned completion existence in the forbidden-matchings model)
In the setup of Proposition 5, every allowed edge (i,z) lies in a perfect matching. Hence for any (z,j) one can select a permutation π with π(σ_j^{-1}(z))=z and avoiding all other forbidden cells. Proof: A is (k−r)-regular bipartite; by Kőnig’s line-coloring theorem (edge-chromatic index equals degree) it decomposes into k−r edge-disjoint perfect matchings. Thus each edge lies in some perfect matching.
Why useful: Enables adding, for each (z,j), any prescribed number of “pinned” permutations (up to feasibility), while preserving completeness and small fibres where desired.

Design-based bijective regime (optimal quadratic size at n=1)
If each f_i is a bijection E→F, then |E|=|F|=:m. If G is complete, any two x,y∈E share some z∈F at distinct colors, so the bipartite incidence (E,F) has λ=1. Fisher’s inequality and standard design theory give m≤k^2−k+1, with equality for projective planes PG(2,q) where k=q+1. This yields complete G on m=k^2−k+1 with n*=1 and all fibres 1; optimal in this regime.

Examples
- k=3, n=1: E=D_3∪{(12),(13),(23)} has |E|=5, G=K_5.
- k=3, bijective regime: PG(2,2) gives |E|=7, G=K_7, n*=1, each f_i bijection.
- General r: For fixed r and large k, E_0(r) yields χ(G)≥(e^{−r}+o(1))k! with n=1 and ≥r small fibres per z.

Obstacles
- Fixed-transversal upper bound D_k+kn requires a bijection τ over columns; without this, the “avoid all k cells” term need not equal D_k. Our constructions all enforce such a transversal (τ=id), so the bound is both applicable and tight in those instances.
- Quantitative counts for pinned completions beyond existence require more delicate permanent bounds for irregular 0–1 matrices; for our purposes, Lemma 6 (existence) suffices.

Next steps
- Formalize Proposition 2’s proof (fixed-transversal optimality) and Theorem 4 (c(k)≥Θ(k!)) for proofs.md.
- Record Proposition 5 with a precise citation to Egorychev–Falikman and the edge-coloring decomposition justifying Lemma 6.
- Explore upper bounds under added regularity: e.g., if each f_i is surjective (as in Corollary 3), can χ(G) exceed Θ(k^2)? The plane shows Θ(k^2) is achievable with bijective fibres; investigating the maximal growth under surjectivity might isolate a sharp threshold between quadratic and factorial behaviour.
