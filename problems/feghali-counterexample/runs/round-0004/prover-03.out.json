  "content": "Ideas\n- Keep the conflict-graph view: a valid partition equals a proper coloring; the target 2n+1 bound asks for \u03c7(G)\u22642n+1. Strong counterexamples come from constructing complete G with small n.\n- Strengthen two regimes:\n  (A) Allow zero fibres: force \u03c7 to be factorial while preserving n=1 and even \u201cat least r small fibres per z\u201d.\n  (B) Forbid zero fibres (all |f_i^{-1}(z)| equal or at least 1): show optimal quadratic ceiling and provide tight constructions (projective planes) with n=1.\n\nNew constructions and proofs\nProposition 1 (Factorial-size K_|E| with n=1 and \u2265r small fibres per value).\nFix integers k\u22653 and r\u2208{1,\u2026,k\u22121}, and any n\u22651. Let F=[k], E\u2286S_k, and define f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i) for i\u2208[k]. Choose r disjoint permutation matrices P_1,\u2026,P_r on [k]\u00d7[k] (e.g., cyclic shifts). Let B:=P_1\u222a\u2026\u222aP_r and A:=J\u2212B (J all-ones). Define E_0(r):={\u03c0\u2208S_k: \u03c0 avoids B}.\n- For every distinct \u03c0,\u03c3\u2208E_0(r), there exists s with \u03c0^{-1}(s)\u2260\u03c3^{-1}(s), hence f_{\u03c0^{-1}(s)}(\u03c0)=s=f_{\u03c3^{-1}(s)}(\u03c3) with distinct indices, so the conflict graph on E_0(r) is complete.\n- For each z\u2208F and each j\u2208[r], the unique row t_j(z) with P_j(t_j(z),z)=1 is forbidden in A; hence f_{t_j(z)}^{-1}(z)=\u2205 on E_0(r). Thus for every z there are \u2265r indices with fibre size 0.\n- van der Waerden bound: A has constant row/col sum k\u2212r. After scaling A\u2032:=A/(k\u2212r) is doubly-stochastic, so per(A\u2032)\u2265k!/k^k. Thus |E_0(r)|=per(A)\u2265(k\u2212r)^k\u00b7k!/k^k = (1\u2212r/k)^k k! \u2248 e^{\u2212r}k!.\nNow, for each z and each j=1,\u2026,r, add any n permutations \u03c0 with \u03c0(t_j(z))=z (there are (k\u22121)! choices; pick any n). Let E:=E_0(r) \u222a \u22c3_{z,j} E_{z,j} where |E_{z,j}|=n and each \u03c0\u2208E_{z,j} satisfies \u03c0(t_j(z))=z. Then:\n- Completeness persists (adding vertices preserves the previously witnessed conflicts).\n- For each z and each j, f_{t_j(z)}^{-1}(z) has size exactly n (E_0(r) contributed 0 on those cells by construction). Hence for every z there are r indices with fibre size exactly n, so the hypothesis holds with n.\n- Therefore \u03c7(G)=|E|\u2265(1\u2212r/k)^k k! + rn k.\nThis yields factorial-size complete graphs already at n=1 and even under the strengthened requirement \u201cfor each z, at least r indices have |f_t^{-1}(z)|\u2264n\u201d.\n\nLemma 2 (Bipartite template; all fibres 1, n=1, complete G).\nLet H be a k-regular bipartite graph with parts (E,F) that admits a proper k-edge-coloring into perfect matchings M_1,\u2026,M_k. Define f_i(x) as the unique neighbor of x via M_i. If any two distinct x,y\u2208E have a common neighbor in H, then:\n- Distinctness: {f_1(x),\u2026,f_k(x)}=N_H(x) are pairwise distinct.\n- Uniform fibres: for all i,z, |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 (each M_i is perfect), so n=1 and no zero fibres.\n- Completeness: if z\u2208N(x)\u2229N(y), the incident colors at z are distinct, say p\u2260q, and f_p(x)=z=f_q(y), so G is complete.\nClassical symmetric designs (PG(2,q), more generally PG(d,q)) supply H.\n\nProposition 3 (Quadratic ceiling in the bijective regime; tightness at planes).\nSuppose |E|=|F|=v and each f_i is a bijection (|f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 \u2200i,z). If G is complete, then v\u2264k^2\u2212k+1, with equality iff every pair of x\u2260y has exactly one common image value (a symmetric 2-(v,k,1) design, i.e., a projective plane).\nProof. Let c_z be the number of preimages x with z among {f_1(x),\u2026,f_k(x)}. Since each color is bijective and values at an x are distinct, c_z=k for all z. Double-count pairs (unordered) of E-vertices sharing some z: LHS = \u2211_z C(c_z,2) = v\u00b7C(k,2) = v\u00b7k(k\u22121)/2. Completeness implies every pair is counted at least once, giving RHS \u2265 C(v,2)=v(v\u22121)/2. Hence v\u2264k(k\u22121)+1. Equality forces each pair to meet at exactly one z; this is a symmetric 2-(v,k,1) design.\nCorollary. For k=q+1 (q a prime power), taking lines vs points in PG(2,q) and applying Lemma 2 gives n=1 and \u03c7(G)=v=k^2\u2212k+1, which is best possible under bijectivity.\n\nExtension 4 (Uniform r-to-1 fibres; upper bound).\nAssume for some r\u22651 that for all i,z we have |f_i^{-1}(z)|=r (so v=|E|=r|F|). If G is complete, then v\u2264kr(kr\u22121)+1.\nProof. For each z, the multiset of preimages across colors has size kr and values are all distinct across colors at fixed x, hence c_z=kr. Double-count: \u2211_z C(kr,2) = |F|\u00b7kr(kr\u22121)/2 = (v/r)\u00b7kr(kr\u22121)/2 \u2265 C(v,2) = v(v\u22121)/2. Rearranging gives v\u2264kr(kr\u22121)+1.\nRemark. Cloning the projective-plane construction r-fold attains v=r(k^2\u2212k+1), which respects but does not meet the bound.\n\nExamples\n- k=3 (Fano plane): v=7; f_1,f_2,f_3 bijections; n=1; G=K_7; \u03c7=7>3.\n- k=3, factorial family at n=1: E={(123),(132)}\u222a{(23),(13),(12)} gives G=K_5.\n- General k, r=2, n=1: Proposition 1 yields \u03c7\u2265(1\u22122/k)^k k! + 2k; for k=6 this is \u2265 (4/6)^6\u00b7720 + 12 \u2248 (0.0878)\u00b7720 + 12 \u2248 75 + 12 = 87.\n\nObstacles\n- Near-tightness for Extension 4 (r>1) remains open: our r-fold blow-up preserves n=1 completeness but does not saturate the quadratic bound; constructing complete-G instances with uniform r-to-1 fibres approaching v\u2248kr(kr\u22121)+1 would be interesting.\n- \u201cPinned completion\u201d counts (choose permutations through a specific cell while avoiding others) are delicate; for our purposes, existence (abundant choices) suffices and was used without quantitative lower bounds beyond (k\u22121)!.\n\nNext steps\n- Record formal proofs of Propositions 1, 3, 4 and Lemma 2 in proofs.md, including the van der Waerden permanent argument.\n- Explore constructions with uniform r-to-1 fibres that increase \u03c7 beyond r\u00b7(k^2\u2212k+1), or prove stronger upper bounds in that regime.\n- Catalog symmetric designs beyond projective planes (biplanes, Hadamard-derived) to widen the set of k with n=1, bijective fibres, and complete G; list explicit (k,v).\n- For completeness-based lower bounds, analyze when completeness holds in general k-regular bipartite templates (pairwise co-neighborhood property) to systematize constructions.\n"
