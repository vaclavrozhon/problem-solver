  "content": "Ideas\n- Keep using the conflict graph G on E: x\u2013y is an edge iff \u2203 p\u2260q with f_p(x)=f_q(y). A valid partition is a proper coloring; the minimum number of parts equals \u03c7(G). Strongest counterexamples: make G complete and |E| as large as possible under strong fibre constraints.\n- Two \u201cextremal regimes\u201d to sharpen: (A) permutation template E\u2286S_k with f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i) (factorial size); (B) bijection regime (each f_i a bijection), where the projective-plane construction is optimal; we formalize a short, general proof and extend to uniform r-to-1 maps.\n\nA general coverage inequality for complete G\nLemma (pair coverage). Let m:=|E|, and for each i\u2208[k], z\u2208F put a_i(z):=|f_i^{-1}(z)|. If G is complete, then\n\\[\n m(m-1)\\ \\le\\ \\sum_{z\\in F}\\Big(\\big(\\sum_{i=1}^k a_i(z)\\big)^2\\ -\\ \\sum_{i=1}^k a_i(z)^2\\Big).\n\\]\nProof. For p\\ne q, define R_{p,q}:=\\{(x,y): f_p(x)=f_q(y)\\}. Then |R_{p,q}|=\\sum_z a_p(z)a_q(z). Completeness says every ordered pair (x,y), x\\ne y, lies in \\bigcup_{p\\ne q}R_{p,q}. Hence m(m-1)\u2264\\sum_{p\\ne q}|R_{p,q}|. But\n\\[\\sum_{p\\ne q}\\sum_z a_p(z)a_q(z)=\\sum_z \\Big(\\big(\\sum_i a_i(z)\\big)^2-\\sum_i a_i(z)^2\\Big).\\]\nThis gives the claim.\nWhy useful: it yields tight upper bounds in structured regimes by plugging fibre constraints.\n\nConsequences\n1) Bijection regime (all fibres 1). Suppose |E|=|F|=:m and each f_i is a bijection, so a_i(z)=1 for all i,z. Then for every z, (\\sum_i a_i(z))^2\u2212\\sum_i a_i(z)^2=k^2\u2212k. Summing over m values of z yields\n\\[m(m-1)\\le m\\,(k^2-k)\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad m\\le k^2-k+1.\\]\nAttainment: For k=q+1 (q prime power), PG(2,q) with a k-edge-coloring of its incidence bipartite graph gives m=q^2+q+1=k^2\u2212k+1, |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all i,z, and G complete. Hence the quadratic bound is tight under maximal regularity.\n\n2) Uniform r-to-1 regime (each f_i is r-to-1). Let m:=|E|, s:=|F|, with m=rs and a_i(z)=r for all i,z. For each z, (\\sum_i a_i(z))^2\u2212\\sum_i a_i(z)^2=(kr)^2\u2212k r^2=r^2 k(k\u22121). Summing over s=m/r values of z gives\n\\[m(m-1)\\le (m/r)\\,r^2 k(k-1)=m\\,r\\,k(k-1)\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad m\\le r\\,k(k-1)+1.\\]\nRemark. This corrects an earlier (too strong) claim v\u2264kr(kr\u22121)+1; the sharp double-counting yields m\u2264r k(k\u22121)+1. The case r=1 recovers the bijection bound. Tightness for r>1 remains open; see Obstacles.\n\nStrengthened factorial counterexamples at n=1 with many small fibres\nConstruction (for every k\u22653 and 1\u2264r\u2264k\u22121). Let F=[k]. For each z, forbid the r \u201ccyclic\u201d cells T_z={z,z+1,\u2026,z+r\u22121} (indices mod k). Let A be the k\u00d7k 0\u20131 matrix with A_{i,z}=1 iff i\u2209T_z. Let E be the set of permutations \u03c0 with A_{i,\u03c0(i)}=1 for all i, and define f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i).\n- Fibres: For every z and each t\u2208T_z, f_t^{-1}(z)=\u2205; thus for each z there are \u2265r indices with fibre 0, so the hypothesis holds with n=1 (indeed, strictly stronger).\n- Completeness: The permutation-template argument makes G complete on E.\n- Size lower bound (van der Waerden). A has constant row/column sums d:=k\u2212r. Normalize B:=A/d; B is doubly-stochastic. Egorychev\u2013Falikman gives per(B)\u2265k!/k^k, hence\n\\[|E|=\\operatorname{per}(A)=d^k\\operatorname{per}(B)\\ge (k\u2212r)^k\\,\\frac{k!}{k^k}=\\big(1\u2212\\tfrac{r}{k}\\big)^k k!\\ge e^{\u2212r}(1\u2212o(1))\\,k!\\ (k\\to\\infty).\\]\nThus \u03c7(G)=|E| is factorial in k already for n=1 and any fixed r\u22651, even under the stronger \u201c\u2265 r small fibres per z\u201d constraint.\n\nPermutation template with fixed transversal: sharp linear bound in n\nLet F=[k], f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i) on E\u2286S_k, and fix a bijection \u03c4:F\u2192[k]. Suppose the \u201cwitness caps\u201d hold: |{\u03c0\u2208E: \u03c0(\u03c4(z))=z}|\u2264n for all z.\nProposition. |E|\u2264D_k+kn, with equality for all 1\u2264n\u2264D_{k\u22121}. Moreover G is complete.\nProof. Split E into E_0 (avoid all designated cells C_\u03c4={ (\u03c4(z),z) }) and E_1 (hit at least one). Then |E_0|=D_k, and by assigning every \u03c0\u2208E_1 to the least z with \u03c0(\u03c4(z))=z we get |E_1|\u2264\\sum_z n=kn. For tightness, take E_0:=all derangements, and for each z pick n permutations with a unique fixed point at z (at least D_{k\u22121} many avail.); completeness follows from the permutation argument.\nCorollary. For fixed k and small n, \u03c7(G)=D_k+kn\u2248e^{\u22121}k! dominates 2n+1 by a factorial margin.\n\nExamples\n- k=3, n=1 (permutation template): E={(123),(132)}\u222a{(23),(13),(12)} gives \u03c7(G)=5>3.\n- k=q+1, n=1 (projective plane): \u03c7(G)=k^2\u2212k+1 with |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 \u2200i,z, optimal in the bijection regime.\n- k arbitrary, r=1 (forbidden-cells family): |E|\u2265(1\u22121/k)^k k!\u2248e^{\u22121}k!, with \u22651 zero-fibre index per z and \u03c7(G)=|E|.\n\nObstacles and corrections\n- Uniform r-to-1: The upper bound m\u2264r k(k\u22121)+1 is sharp for r=1 but we lack constructions attaining it for r>1. A naive \u201cduplicate-E\u201d blow-up of the projective-plane example fails: pairs coming from the same duplicated vertex are not adjacent (p must equal q to hit the same point), so G is not complete.\n- Pinned completions (through a fixed allowed cell in a regular 0\u20131 matrix) for n>1: existence of one perfect matching through an edge is easy in regular bipartite graphs (edge-color into 1-factors), but guaranteeing \u2265n distinct ones uniformly is nontrivial; we avoid unjustified quantitative claims.\n\nNext steps\n- Record the coverage inequality and its corollaries (bijection and uniform r-to-1 bounds) in proofs.md, explicitly correcting the earlier r-to-1 bound to m\u2264r k(k\u22121)+1.\n- Seek near-tight r>1 constructions. One direction: start from a projective plane on (E,F) and fold multiple E-vertices to share images in a way that preserves completeness (e.g., replace each edge-color class by a small gadget that still yields one image per index). Alternatively, search for incidence structures with \u201ctwo colors per meeting\u201d that could realize r=2.\n- Strengthen factorial families: combine the \u201cforbidden r matchings\u201d core with one pinned matching per z (Hall\u2019s theorem guarantees existence) to also meet additional local constraints (e.g., exactly one designated index per z with fibre \u22641), while retaining size \u2248e^{\u2212r}k!.\n- Small-k classification: for k=3 and n=1, check by search whether \u03c7(G) can exceed 7 (the bijection bound cap) when allowing non-bijective functions; current best is 7 via Fano plane; a full classification would be informative."
