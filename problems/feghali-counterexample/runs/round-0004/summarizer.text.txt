{"summary_md":"Recast the partition problem via the conflict graph G (vertices E; edge x–y iff ∃ p≠q with f_p(x)=f_q(y)), so required parts = χ(G). Main constructions: (i) Permutation template f_i(π)=π(i) on E⊆S_k gives G complete, n*=(k−1)!, χ=k!, hence χ=k·n* (so any universal linear bound χ≤c(k)n* needs c(k)≥k). (ii) Derangement-augmented variant E=D_k ∪ ⋃_s E_s yields prescribed n with χ=D_k+kn (e.g. k=3,n=1 → K5). (iii) Projective-plane template (k=q+1) gives |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 ∀i,z but G complete on k^2−k+1 vertices (n*=1, χ large). Extensions: factorial cores E_0(r) avoiding r matchings with |E_0(r)|≥((1−r/k)^k)k! (van der Waerden) yield factorial χ even under strengthened small-fibre constraints. Pair-coverage inequality gives tight bijective bound m≤k^2−k+1 and corrected uniform r-to-1 bound m≤r k(k−1)+1.
