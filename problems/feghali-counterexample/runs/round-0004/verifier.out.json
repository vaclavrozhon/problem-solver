  "feedback_md": "Substantial, rigorous progress with two complementary families and clean upper-bound structure in strong regimes. The permutation template f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i) and the incidence/design template are correctly exploited to force complete conflict graphs, converting the partition question into chromatic-number lower bounds.\n\nCorrect and strong:\n- Permutation template: completeness of G for any E\u2286S_k is correct. The fixed-transversal (\u03c4) framework and the sharp bound |E|\u2264D_k+kn with a matching construction E=D_k\u2294(\u22c3_z U_z) are sound; this yields \u03c7(G)=D_k+kn and n*=n, giving factorial \u03c7 already at n=1 (k=3: K5). The linear-coefficient lower bound c(k)\u2265D_k+k for any putative \u03c7\u2264c(k)n* is valid and sharp within this scheme.\n- Many-small-fibres variant: forbidding r permutation matchings and applying Egorychev\u2013Falikman (van der Waerden) gives |E_0(r)|\u2265((1\u2212r/k)^k)k!, hence factorial \u03c7 at n=1 even when every z has \u2265r indices with fibre 0. Completeness is inherited.\n- Incidence/design template: via a k-edge-coloring of a k-regular bipartite incidence graph with pairwise co-neighborhood property, we get |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all i,z (n=1) and G complete. The bijective-regime upper bound m\u2264k^2\u2212k+1 with equality for PG(2,q) is correct.\n\nCorrections needed:\n- Pinned completions: the claim that \u201cevery allowed edge lies in a perfect matching\u201d implies existence of permutations using exactly one forbidden cell is invalid (that cell is not an allowed edge). Either give a Hall/rook-polynomial/LLL argument for existence in the specific forbidden-union model or omit quantitative claims; for our main results, the factorial core E_0(r) suffices.\n- Surjectivity in the permutation construction (Prop A): this holds as stated only when \u03c4=id (after renaming). For general \u03c4, the argument given does not ensure surjectivity of each f_i; please qualify or remove.\n- Uniform r-to-1 upper bound: the correct bound from pair-coverage is |E|\u2264r k(k\u22121)+1, not kr(kr\u22121)+1. We have corrected proofs.md accordingly.\n\nNext steps:\n- Formalize (and cite) the van der Waerden bound for E_0(r) and keep pinned-completion existence qualitative (Hall) unless a correct quantitative bound is derived.\n- Explore near-tight constructions under uniform r-to-1 fibres (r>1) approaching the r k(k\u22121)+1 ceiling or prove stronger upper bounds under additional structure.\n- Map the surjectivity regime (each f_i surjective but not necessarily uniform) via the pair-coverage inequality to obtain general upper bounds and compare with constructions.",

Define the conflict graph G on E by joining x\u2260y iff \u2203 p\u2260q with f_p(x)=f_q(y).\n\n1) Completeness for the permutation template\nLemma 1. Let F=[k], E\u2286S_k, and f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i). Then G is complete on E.\nProof. For \u03c0\u2260\u03c3 pick s with \u03c0^{-1}(s)\u2260\u03c3^{-1}(s). Set p=\u03c0^{-1}(s), q=\u03c3^{-1}(s). Then p\u2260q and f_p(\u03c0)=s=f_q(\u03c3). \u220e\n\n2) Sharp bound within a fixed transversal (permutation template)\nProposition 2 (Fixed-transversal optimality). Fix a bijection \u03c4:F\u2192[k]. Suppose E\u2286S_k satisfies, for each z\u2208F,\nC_z:=|{\u03c0\u2208E : \u03c0(\u03c4(z))=z}| \u2264 n.\nThen |E|\u2264D_k+kn, where D_k is the derangement number. Moreover, for every 1\u2264n\u2264D_{k\u22121} there exists E with |E|=D_k+kn and complete G.\nProof. Let E_0 be permutations avoiding all cells (\u03c4(z),z). By conjugation, |E_0|\u2264D_k. Let B:=E\\E_0. Each \u03c0\u2208B hits at least one designated cell; assigning each \u03c0 to the least such z yields an injection into \u22c3_z of n slots, so |B|\u2264\u2211_z n=kn. Hence |E|\u2264D_k+kn. For equality, take E_0 to be all derangements and for each z pick n permutations with exactly one fixed point at z; G is complete by Lemma 1. \u220e\n\nCorollary 3 (Coefficient lower bound). If a universal bound \u03c7(G)\u2264c(k) n* holds for all instances, then c(k)\u2265D_k+k by applying Proposition 2 with n*=1, since \u03c7(G)=|E|=D_k+k.\n\n3) Many small fibres per z: factorial core via van der Waerden\nLemma 4. Let \u03c3_1,\u2026,\u03c3_r\u2208S_k and forbid cells B=\u22c3_{j=1}^r{(i,\u03c3_j(i))}. Let A be the 0\u20131 allowed matrix (complement). Then per(A)\u2265((k\u2212r)/k)^k k!=((1\u2212r/k)^k)k!.\nProof. A has row/column sums d:=k\u2212r. Normalize B:=A/d to a doubly-stochastic matrix. Egorychev\u2013Falikman gives per(B)\u2265k!/k^k, hence per(A)=d^k per(B)\u2265((k\u2212r)/k)^k k!. \u220e\n\nCorollary 5. With E:= {\u03c0\u2208S_k: (i,\u03c0(i)) is allowed}, f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i) gives G complete (Lemma 1). For each z, the r indices t_j=\u03c3_j^{-1}(z) satisfy |f_{t_j}^{-1}(z)|=0. Thus n=1 (indeed stronger) and \u03c7(G)=|E|\u2265((1\u2212r/k)^k)k!.\n\n4) Pair-coverage inequality and consequences\nLemma 6 (Pair coverage). Let m:=|E| and a_i(z):=|f_i^{-1}(z)|. If G is complete, then\nm(m\u22121) \u2264 \u2211_{z\u2208F} [ (\u2211_{i=1}^k a_i(z))^2 \u2212 \u2211_{i=1}^k a_i(z)^2 ].\nProof. For p\u2260q define R_{p,q}:={(x,y): f_p(x)=f_q(y)}; then |R_{p,q}|=\u2211_z a_p(z)a_q(z). Completeness implies every ordered pair (x,y), x\u2260y, lies in \u22c3_{p\u2260q}R_{p,q}, so m(m\u22121)\u2264\u2211_{p\u2260q}|R_{p,q}|. Summing and rearranging yields the formula. \u220e\n\nCorollary 7 (Bijective regime). If each f_i is a bijection E\u2192F (so |E|=|F|=:m and a_i(z)=1), then\nm(m\u22121) \u2264 m(k^2\u2212k), hence m\u2264k^2\u2212k+1.\nAttainment. For k=q+1, let E be the lines and F the points of PG(2,q). A proper k-edge-coloring of the incidence graph yields bijections f_i with |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 and completeness, so m=q^2+q+1=k^2\u2212k+1. \u220e\n\nCorollary 8 (Uniform r-to-1 regime). If for some r\u22651, a_i(z)=r for all i,z (so |E|=v=r|F|), then\nv(v\u22121) \u2264 v\u00b7r\u00b7k(k\u22121), hence v\u2264r k(k\u22121)+1.\n\n5) Incidence graph template (all fibres 1)\nLemma 9. Let H be a k-regular bipartite graph on (E,F) with a proper k-edge-coloring into perfect matchings M_1,\u2026,M_k. Define f_i(x) as the unique neighbor of x via M_i. Then pointwise distinctness holds; |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all i,z; and if any two x\u2260y\u2208E share a neighbor in H, then G is complete.\nProof. Distinct colors around x give distinct values; each M_i is perfect, giving uniform fibres; shared neighbor z yields colors p\u2260q at z, so f_p(x)=z=f_q(y). \u220e"
