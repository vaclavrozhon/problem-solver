We validated: (1) permutation-based counterexamples with n*=n and χ=|D_k|+kn (complete G), giving factorial χ at n=1; (2) a factorial core E_0(r) via van der Waerden for the “≥r small fibres per z” variant (n=1); (3) a pair-coverage inequality yielding the tight bijective bound |E|≤k^2−k+1 (attained by projective planes) and the corrected uniform r-to-1 bound |E|≤r k(k−1)+1. We flagged and removed an incorrect pinned-completions argument and qualified a surjectivity claim. Proofs updated accordingly.
