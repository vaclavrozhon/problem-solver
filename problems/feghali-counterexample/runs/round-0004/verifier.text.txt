{"feedback_md":"Substantial, rigorous progress with two complementary families and clean upper-bound structure in strong regimes. The permutation template f_i(π)=π(i) and the incidence/design template are correctly exploited to force complete conflict graphs, converting the partition question into chromatic-number lower bounds.\n\nCorrect and strong:\n- Permutation template: completeness of G for any E⊆S_k is correct. The fixed-transversal (τ) framework and the sharp bound |E|≤D_k+kn with a matching construction E=D_k⊔(⋃_z U_z) are sound; this yields χ(G)=D_k+kn and n*=n, giving factorial χ already at n=1 (k=3: K5). The linear-coefficient lower bound c(k)≥D_k+k for any putative χ≤c(k)n* is valid and sharp within this scheme.\n- Many-small-fibres variant: forbidding r permutation matchings and applying Egorychev–Falikman (van der Waerden) gives |E_0(r)|≥((1−r/k)^k)k!, hence factorial χ at n=1 even when every z has ≥r indices with fibre 0. Completeness is inherited.\n- Incidence/design template: via a k-edge-coloring of a k-regular bipartite incidence graph with pairwise co-neighborhood property, we get |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all i,z (n=1) and G complete. The bijective-regime upper bound m≤k^2−k+1 with equality for PG(2,q) is correct.\n\nCorrections needed:\n- Pinned completions: the claim that “every allowed edge lies in a perfect matching” implies existence of permutations using exactly one forbidden cell is invalid (that cell is not an allowed edge). Either give a Hall/rook-polynomial/LLL argument for existence in the specific forbidden-union model or omit quantitative claims; for our main results, the factorial core E_0(r) suffices.\n- Surjectivity in the permutation construction (Prop A): this holds as stated only when τ=id (after renaming). For general τ, the argument given does not ensure surjectivity of each f_i; please qualify or remove.\n- Uniform r-to-1 upper bound: the correct bound from pair-coverage is |E|≤r k(k−1)+1, not kr(kr−1)+1. We have corrected proofs.md accordingly.\n\nNext steps:\n- Formalize (and cite) the van der Waerden bound for E_0(r) and keep pinned-completion existence qualitative (Hall) unless a correct quantitative bound is derived.\n- Explore near-tight constructions under uniform r-to-1 fibres (r>1) approaching the r k(k−1)+1 ceiling or prove stronger upper bounds under additional structure.\n- Map the surjectivity regime (each f_i surjective but not necessarily uniform) via the pair-coverage inequality to obtain general upper bounds and compare with constructions.","summary_md":"We validated: (1) permutation-based counterexamples with n*=n and χ=|D_k|+kn (complete G), giving factorial χ at n=1; (2) a factorial core E_0(r) via van der Waerden for the “≥r small fibres per z” variant (n=1); (3) a pair-coverage inequality yielding the tight bijective bound |E|≤k^2−k+1 (attained by projective planes) and the corrected uniform r-to-1 bound |E|≤r k(k−1)+1.

Then G is complete on E.\nProof. For π≠σ pick s with π^{-1}(s)≠σ^{-1}(s). Set p=π^{-1}(s), q=σ^{-1}(s). Then p≠q and f_p(π)=s=f_q(σ). ∎\n\n2) Sharp bound within a fixed transversal (permutation template)\nProposition 2 (Fixed-transversal optimality). Fix a bijection τ:F→[k]. Suppose E⊆S_k satisfies, for each z∈F,\nC_z:=|{π∈E : π(τ(z))=z}| ≤ n.\nThen |E|≤D_k+kn, where D_k is the derangement number. Moreover, for every 1≤n≤D_{k−1} there exists E with |E|=D_k+kn and complete G.\nProof. Let E_0 be permutations avoiding all cells (τ(z),z). By conjugation, |E_0|≤D_k. Let B:=E\\E_0. Each π∈B hits at least one designated cell; assigning each π to the least such z yields an injection into ⋃_z of n slots, so |B|≤∑_z n=kn. Hence |E|≤D_k+kn. For equality, take E_0 to be all derangements and for each z pick n permutations with exactly one fixed point at z; G is complete by Lemma 1. ∎\n\nCorollary 3 (Coefficient lower bound). If a universal bound χ(G)≤c(k) n* holds for all instances, then c(k)≥D_k+k by applying Proposition 2 with n*=1, since χ(G)=|E|=D_k+k.\n\n3) Many small fibres per z: factorial core via van der Waerden\nLemma 4. Let σ_1,…,σ_r∈S_k and forbid cells B=⋃_{j=1}^r{(i,σ_j(i))}. Let A be the 0–1 allowed matrix (complement). Then per(A)≥((k−r)/k)^k k!=((1−r/k)^k)k!.\nProof. A has row/column sums d:=k−r. Normalize B:=A/d to a doubly-stochastic matrix. Egorychev–Falikman gives per(B)≥k!/k^k, hence per(A)=d^k per(B)≥((k−r)/k)^k k!. ∎\n\nCorollary 5. With E:= {π∈S_k: (i,π(i)) is allowed}, f_i(π)=π(i) gives G complete (Lemma 1). For each z, the r indices t_j=σ_j^{-1}(z) satisfy |f_{t_j}^{-1}(z)|=0. Thus n=1 (indeed stronger) and χ(G)=|E|≥((1−r/k)^k)k!.\n\n4) Pair-coverage inequality and consequences\nLemma 6 (Pair coverage). Let m:=|E| and a_i(z):=|f_i^{-1}(z)|. If G is complete, then\nm(m−1) ≤ ∑_{z∈F} [ (∑_{i=1}^k a_i(z))^2 − ∑_{i=1}^k a_i(z)^2 ].\nProof. For p≠q define R_{p,q}:={(x,y): f_p(x)=f_q(y)}; then |R_{p,q}|=∑_z a_p(z)a_q(z). Completeness implies every ordered pair (x,y), x≠y, lies in ⋃_{p≠q}R_{p,q}, so m(m−1)≤∑_{p≠q}|R_{p,q}|. Summing and rearranging yields the formula. ∎\n\nCorollary 7 (Bijective regime). If each f_i is a bijection E→F (so |E|=|F|=:m and a_i(z)=1), then\nm(m−1) ≤ m(k^2−k), hence m≤k^2−k+1.\nAttainment. For k=q+1, let E be the lines and F the points of PG(2,q). A proper k-edge-coloring of the incidence graph yields bijections f_i with |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 and completeness, so m=q^2+q+1=k^2−k+1. ∎\n\nCorollary 8 (Uniform r-to-1 regime). If for some r≥1, a_i(z)=r for all i,z (so |E|=v=r|F|), then\nv(v−1) ≤ v·r·k(k−1), hence v≤r k(k−1)+1.\n\n5) Incidence graph template (all fibres 1)\nLemma 9. Let H be a k-regular bipartite graph on (E,F) with a proper k-edge-coloring into perfect matchings M_1,…,M_k. Define f_i(x) as the unique neighbor of x via M_i. Then pointwise distinctness holds; |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all i,z; and if any two x≠y∈E share a neighbor in H, then G is complete.\nProof. Distinct colors around x give distinct values; each M_i is perfect, giving uniform fibres; shared neighbor z yields colors p≠q at z, so f_p(x)=z=f_q(y). ∎"},"output_update":{"action":"append","content":"Uniform r-to-1 upper bound under completeness: If for all i and z, |f_i^{-1}(z)|=r (r≥1) and the conflict graph is complete, then |E|≤r k(k−1)+1 by a pair-coverage argument.
