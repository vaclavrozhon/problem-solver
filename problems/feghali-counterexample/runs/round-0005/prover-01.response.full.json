Fix a bijection \u03c4:F\u2192[k]. For each z\u2208F, let C_z be the cell (\u03c4(z),z). Define\\n- E_0 := {\u03c0\u2208S_k : \u03c0(\u03c4(z))\u2260z for all z} (|E_0|=D_k),\\n- U_z \u2286 {\u03c0\u2208S_k : \u03c0(\u03c4(z))=z and \u03c0(\u03c4(z\u2032))\u2260z\u2032 for z\u2032\u2260z} with |U_z|=n (feasible when n\u2264D_{k\u22121}).\\nLet E := E_0 \u2294 (\u22c3_z U_z), and keep f_i as above.\\nClaims:\\n- Pointwise distinctness holds (permutations).\\n- For each z, |f_{\u03c4(z)}^{-1}(z)|=n, hence n* = n.\\n- G is complete for any E\u2286S_k: if \u03c0\u2260\u03c3, choose s with \u03c0^{-1}(s)\u2260\u03c3^{-1}(s), then f_{\u03c0^{-1}(s)}(\u03c0)=s=f_{\u03c3^{-1}(s)}(\u03c3) with distinct indices.\\n- \u03c7(G)=|E|=D_k+kn.\\n- Optimality (fixed \u03c4): If E\u2286S_k satisfies |{\u03c0\u2208E: \u03c0(\u03c4(z))=z}|\u2264n for all z, then |E|\u2264D_k+kn. Proof: Decompose E=E_0\u2294B with B the permutations that hit \u22651 C_z. Assign each \u03c0\u2208B to the least z with \u03c0(\u03c4(z))=z. Each z receives \u2264n, so |B|\u2264kn and |E|\u2264D_k+kn.

The incidence bipartite graph is k-regular, hence has a proper k-edge-coloring (K\u0151nig). For i\u2208[k], define f_i(x) as the unique point z incident with block x in color i. Then: (i) pointwise distinctness holds on each x; (ii) |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all i,z (n*=1); (iii) any two distinct blocks meet in \u03bb\u22651 points, and at each common point the two incident colors are distinct, so the blocks are adjacent in G. Thus G is complete on |E|=v.\\nExample: PG(2,q) (k=q+1, \u03bb=1) yields \u03c7(G)=v=q^2+q+1=k^2\u2212k+1 with n*=1.\\n\\nPair-coverage inequality and uniform-fibre upper bounds under completeness\\nLet a_i(z):=|f_i^{-1}(z)| and m:=|E|. If G is complete then every ordered pair (x,y), x\u2260y, witnesses a conflict at some z with indices p\u2260q. Counting such ordered pairs via z gives\\n- m(m\u22121) \u2264 \u2211_{z\u2208F} [ (\u2211_i a_i(z))^2 \u2212 \u2211_i a_i(z)^2 ].\\nApplications:\\n- Bijective regime: a_i(z)=1 for all i,z. Then \u2211_i a_i(z)=k and \u2211_i a_i(z)^2=k, so m(m\u22121) \u2264 |F|\u00b7k(k\u22121). Since |F|=m, we get m\u2264k^2\u2212k+1 (tight via PG(2,q)).\\n- Uniform r-to-1 regime: a_i(z)=r. Then |F|=m/r and per z the bracket equals k r (k r \u2212 r). Hence m(m\u22121) \u2264 (m/r)\u00b7k r (k\u22121) = m\u00b7r k(k\u22121), giving m \u2264 r k(k\u22121)+1.\\n\\nExamples\\n- k=3, n=1 (Prop A): E={two 3-cycles}\u222a{three transpositions}; \u03c7=5>2n+1.\\n- k=3, n=1 (Lemma C): PG(2,2) gives \u03c7=7>3 with all fibres 1.\\n- Many-small-fibres, r=\u230a\u03b1k\u230b: \u03c7\u2265k!\u00b7(1\u2212\u03b1)^k, so for any fixed \u03b1\u2208(0,1), \u03c7 is factorial in k at n=1 while every z has \u2265\u03b1k indices with fibre 0.\\n\\nObstacles and cautions\\n- \u201cPinned completions\u201d (forcing permutations that use exactly one forbidden cell and avoid all others) for r\u22652: the residual submatrix is not regular; uniform counting bounds claimed earlier are invalid. For our current goals, the factorial core E_0(r) suffices (n=1, \u2265r zero-fibres per z). Existence for small n beyond 1 can be pursued via Hall/LLL or rook-polynomial methods.\\n- The upper bound |E|\u2264D_k+kn is tight only within the fixed-transversal model (the capped cells form a bijection \u03c4). No such global cap exists in the general \u201c\u2203t(z)\u201d setting.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Add proofs of Proposition A (including fixed-transversal optimality), Proposition B (van der Waerden lower bound), and Lemma C to proofs.md.\\n- Extend many-small-fibres to prescribed n>1: seek Hall/LLL-based selection of \u201cpinned completions\u201d to add \u2248 kn permutations while retaining completeness, yielding \u03c7 \u2273 k!\u00b7(1\u2212r/k)^k + k r n.\\n- Under uniform r-to-1 fibres, investigate constructions approaching the upper bound m \u2264 r k(k\u22121)+1; quantify the best achievable m and identify additional structural constraints that reduce the bound.\\n- Record small explicit instances (k=4: \u03c7=D_4+4n=9+4n; k=5, r=2: \u03c7\u2265120\u00b7(3/5)^5\u22489) for quick verification.\"}",
