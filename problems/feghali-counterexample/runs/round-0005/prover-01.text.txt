Ideas
- Push counterexamples under progressively stronger fibre constraints, always forcing the conflict graph G to be complete so that the number of required parts equals |E|. Provide short, checkable proofs and quantify sizes.

Proposition A (Permutation template; prescribed n; complete; optimal within a fixed transversal)
Setup: Let k≥3, F=[k], and define f_i(π)=π(i) for π∈S_k. Fix a bijection τ:F→[k]. For each z∈F, let C_z be the cell (τ(z),z). Define
- E_0 := {π∈S_k : π(τ(z))≠z for all z} (|E_0|=D_k),
- U_z ⊆ {π∈S_k : π(τ(z))=z and π(τ(z′))≠z′ for z′≠z} with |U_z|=n (feasible when n≤D_{k−1}).
Let E := E_0 ⊔ (⋃_z U_z), and keep f_i as above.
Claims:
- Pointwise distinctness holds (permutations).
- For each z, |f_{τ(z)}^{-1}(z)|=n, hence n* = n.
- G is complete for any E⊆S_k: if π≠σ, choose s with π^{-1}(s)≠σ^{-1}(s), then f_{π^{-1}(s)}(π)=s=f_{σ^{-1}(s)}(σ) with distinct indices.
- χ(G)=|E|=D_k+kn.
- Optimality (fixed τ): If E⊆S_k satisfies |{π∈E: π(τ(z))=z}|≤n for all z, then |E|≤D_k+kn. Proof: Decompose E=E_0⊔B with B the permutations that hit ≥1 C_z. Assign each π∈B to the least z with π(τ(z))=z. Each z receives ≤n, so |B|≤kn and |E|≤D_k+kn. Our construction attains equality.
Consequence: Any universal bound χ(G)≤c(k)·n* must satisfy c(k)≥D_k+k≈k!/e (apply with n*=1).

Proposition B (Many small fibres per value; factorial χ at n=1)
Let 1≤r≤k−1. Choose r bijections τ_1,…,τ_r:F→[k] (disjoint perfect matchings). Forbid B:=⋃_{j=1}^r{(τ_j(z),z)}. Let A be the 0–1 complement in [k]×[k], and put
E_0(r):={π∈S_k : (i,π(i))∈A for all i}, f_i(π)=π(i).
- For every z, the r indices {τ_j(z)} have fibre 0 at z, whence the hypothesis holds with n=1 and, in fact, “≥r small fibres per z”.
- G is complete (as above).
- Size lower bound: A has row/column sums s:=k−r. Normalize B:=A/s to a doubly stochastic matrix, so by Egorychev–Falikman (van der Waerden),
  |E_0(r)| = perm(A) ≥ s^k·(k!/k^k) = k!·(1−r/k)^k.
Hence χ(G)≥k!·(1−r/k)^k≈e^{−r}k! already at n=1, even with ≥r small fibres per z.

Lemma C (Incidence-design template; all fibres 1; complete G)
Let (F,E,ℐ) be a symmetric 2-(v,k,λ) design (v=b, each block and point has degree k). The incidence bipartite graph is k-regular, hence has a proper k-edge-coloring (Kőnig). For i∈[k], define f_i(x) as the unique point z incident with block x in color i. Then: (i) pointwise distinctness holds on each x; (ii) |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all i,z (n*=1); (iii) any two distinct blocks meet in λ≥1 points, and at each common point the two incident colors are distinct, so the blocks are adjacent in G. Thus G is complete on |E|=v.
Example: PG(2,q) (k=q+1, λ=1) yields χ(G)=v=q^2+q+1=k^2−k+1 with n*=1.

Pair-coverage inequality and uniform-fibre upper bounds under completeness
Let a_i(z):=|f_i^{-1}(z)| and m:=|E|. If G is complete then every ordered pair (x,y), x≠y, witnesses a conflict at some z with indices p≠q. Counting such ordered pairs via z gives
- m(m−1) ≤ ∑_{z∈F} [ (∑_i a_i(z))^2 − ∑_i a_i(z)^2 ].
Applications:
- Bijective regime: a_i(z)=1 for all i,z. Then ∑_i a_i(z)=k and ∑_i a_i(z)^2=k, so m(m−1) ≤ |F|·k(k−1). Since |F|=m, we get m≤k^2−k+1 (tight via PG(2,q)).
- Uniform r-to-1 regime: a_i(z)=r. Then |F|=m/r and per z the bracket equals k r (k r − r). Hence m(m−1) ≤ (m/r)·k r (k−1) = m·r k(k−1), giving m ≤ r k(k−1)+1.

Examples
- k=3, n=1 (Prop A): E={two 3-cycles}∪{three transpositions}; χ=5>2n+1.
- k=3, n=1 (Lemma C): PG(2,2) gives χ=7>3 with all fibres 1.
- Many-small-fibres, r=⌊αk⌋: χ≥k!·(1−α)^k, so for any fixed α∈(0,1), χ is factorial in k at n=1 while every z has ≥αk indices with fibre 0.

Obstacles and cautions
- “Pinned completions” (forcing permutations that use exactly one forbidden cell and avoid all others) for r≥2: the residual submatrix is not regular; uniform counting bounds claimed earlier are invalid. For our current goals, the factorial core E_0(r) suffices (n=1, ≥r zero-fibres per z). Existence for small n beyond 1 can be pursued via Hall/LLL or rook-polynomial methods.
- The upper bound |E|≤D_k+kn is tight only within the fixed-transversal model (the capped cells form a bijection τ). No such global cap exists in the general “∃t(z)” setting.

Next steps
- Add proofs of Proposition A (including fixed-transversal optimality), Proposition B (van der Waerden lower bound), and Lemma C to proofs.md.
- Extend many-small-fibres to prescribed n>1: seek Hall/LLL-based selection of “pinned completions” to add ≈ kn permutations while retaining completeness, yielding χ ≳ k!·(1−r/k)^k + k r n.
- Under uniform r-to-1 fibres, investigate constructions approaching the upper bound m ≤ r k(k−1)+1; quantify the best achievable m and identify additional structural constraints that reduce the bound.
- Record small explicit instances (k=4: χ=D_4+4n=9+4n; k=5, r=2: χ≥120·(3/5)^5≈9) for quick verification.
