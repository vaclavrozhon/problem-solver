We seek to maximize |E| subject to fibre constraints to get the strongest counterexamples.\\n- Two refined, auditable steps: (i) prove a sharp upper bound within the \u201cfixed transversal\u201d setting (tight with our construction), (ii) quantify the size of factorial cores under the \u201c\u2265 r small fibres per z\u201d variant using two-sided permanent bounds (van der Waerden + Br\u00e9gman), showing asymptotic optimality up to subexponential factors.\\n\\nLemma (completeness in the permutation template)\\nFor F=[k], E\u2286S_k, f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i), and G defined by xy\u2208E(G) iff \u2203p\u2260q with f_p(x)=f_q(y), G is complete. Proof: for \u03c0\u2260\u03c3 choose s with \u03c0^{-1}(s)\u2260\u03c3^{-1}(s); then f_{\u03c0^{-1}(s)}(\u03c0)=s=f_{\u03c3^{-1}(s)}(\u03c3) with distinct indices.\\n\\nProposition 1 (fixed-transversal optimality; tightness)\\nFix a bijection \u03c4:[k]\u2192[k] and E\u2286S_k with C_z:=|{\u03c0\u2208E:\u03c0(\u03c4(z))=z}|\u2264n for all z. Then |E|\u2264D_k+kn, with equality for E=D_k \u222a \u22c3_{z}A_z where each A_z consists of n permutations having exactly one fixed point at (\u03c4(z),z).\\nProof. Split E=A\u222aB where A avoids all (\u03c4(z),z) and B hits \u22651 such cell. Then |A|\u2264D_k. Also S:=\u2211_z C_z\u2264kn. Each \u03c0\u2208B contributes to exactly one of the C_z if we assign it to the least z with \u03c0(\u03c4(z))=z, so |B|\u2264S\u2264kn. The construction attains equality.\\nConsequence. With \u03c4=id and n=1, \u03c7(G)=|E|=D_k+k\u223ce^{-1}k! while n*=1. Hence any putative universal bound \u03c7\u2264c(k)\u00b7n* forces c(k)\u2265D_k+k\u2248e^{-1}k! (strengthening the c(k)\u2265k obstruction).\\n\\nTheorem 2 (two-sided bounds for \u201c\u2265 r small fibres per z\u201d cores; asymptotic e^{-r} factor)\\nLet \u03c3_1,\u2026,\u03c3_r\u2208S_k and let A be the k\u00d7k 0\u20131 matrix with ones exactly off the union of the r permutation matrices M(\u03c3_j). Let t:=k\u2212r be the row/column sum of A. Then the number of permutations avoiding all forbidden cells equals per(A), and\\n(t/k)^k k! \u2264 per(A) \u2264 (t!)^{k/t}.\\nProof. Lower bound: normalize B:=A/t, a doubly-stochastic matrix. By Egorychev\u2013Falikman (van der Waerden), per(B)\u2265k!/k^k; hence per(A)=t^k per(B)\u2265(t/k)^k k!. Upper bound: by Br\u00e9gman, per(A)\u2264\u220f_{i=1}^k (t!)^{1/t}=(t!)^{k/t}.\\nAsymptotics. By Stirling, per(A)=e^{-r+o(1)}k! as k\u2192\u221e with fixed r. Thus the factorial core size |E_0(r)| is \u0398(e^{-r}k!).\\nCorollary 3 (robust factorial counterexamples for \u2265r-small-fibres variant, n=1)\\nLet E_0(r):={\u03c0\u2208S_k : \u03c0(i)\u2260\u03c3_j(i) \u2200i,j}. Define f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i). Then for each z and for the r indices t_j:=\u03c3_j^{-1}(z), |f_{t_j}^{-1}(z)|=0, so the strengthened hypothesis (\u2265r small fibres per z, with n=1) holds. By the Lemma, G is complete and \u03c7(G)=|E_0(r)|=e^{-r+o(1)}k!.\\n\\nExamples\\n- k=3, n=1 (fixed-transversal): E=D_3\u222a{(12),(13),(23)} has |E|=5=\u03c7(G)>2\u00b71+1.\\n- General r: For fixed r and large k, |E|=\u03c7(G)\u2265((1\u2212r/k)^k)k!=e^{-r+o(1)}k! with n=1 and \u2265r indices per z having fibre 0.\\n\\nObstacles and corrections\\n- The \u201cpinned completion through a forbidden cell\u201d (constructing permutations using exactly one forbidden edge) is delicate; existence is not guaranteed by regularity of the allowed graph alone. We avoid quantitative claims here; factorial cores E_0(r) suffice for strong counterexamples.\\n- Surjectivity of each f_i in the n=1 construction holds when \u03c4=id (after renaming), since derangements cover all z\u2260i in row i and the single-fixed permutation covers z=i.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Add proofs of Proposition 1 and Theorem 2 to proofs.md with precise citations (Egorychev\u2013Falikman, Br\u00e9gman) and Stirling asymptotics. This documents that our cores are asymptotically optimal among t-regular allowed patterns.\\n- Investigate near-tight constructions for the uniform r-to-1 regime (|f_i^{-1}(z)|=r for all i,z) against the corrected pair-coverage upper bound |E|\u2264r k(k\u22121)+1.\\n- Explore additional regularity constraints (e.g., each f_i surjective) and quantify the maximal \u03c7 in terms of k under these constraints (projective planes give \u0398(k^2) at n=1).\"}",
