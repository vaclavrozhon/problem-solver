Ideas
- Keep the permutation template f_i(π)=π(i) with E⊆S_k and F=[k]; then the conflict graph G is complete for any E (so the required number of parts equals |E|). We seek to maximize |E| subject to fibre constraints to get the strongest counterexamples.
- Two refined, auditable steps: (i) prove a sharp upper bound within the “fixed transversal” setting (tight with our construction), (ii) quantify the size of factorial cores under the “≥ r small fibres per z” variant using two-sided permanent bounds (van der Waerden + Brégman), showing asymptotic optimality up to subexponential factors.

Lemma (completeness in the permutation template)
For F=[k], E⊆S_k, f_i(π)=π(i), and G defined by xy∈E(G) iff ∃p≠q with f_p(x)=f_q(y), G is complete. Proof: for π≠σ choose s with π^{-1}(s)≠σ^{-1}(s); then f_{π^{-1}(s)}(π)=s=f_{σ^{-1}(s)}(σ) with distinct indices.

Proposition 1 (fixed-transversal optimality; tightness)
Fix a bijection τ:[k]→[k] and E⊆S_k with C_z:=|{π∈E:π(τ(z))=z}|≤n for all z. Then |E|≤D_k+kn, with equality for E=D_k ∪ ⋃_{z}A_z where each A_z consists of n permutations having exactly one fixed point at (τ(z),z).
Proof. Split E=A∪B where A avoids all (τ(z),z) and B hits ≥1 such cell. Then |A|≤D_k. Also S:=∑_z C_z≤kn. Each π∈B contributes to exactly one of the C_z if we assign it to the least z with π(τ(z))=z, so |B|≤S≤kn. The construction attains equality.
Consequence. With τ=id and n=1, χ(G)=|E|=D_k+k∼e^{-1}k! while n*=1. Hence any putative universal bound χ≤c(k)·n* forces c(k)≥D_k+k≈e^{-1}k! (strengthening the c(k)≥k obstruction).

Theorem 2 (two-sided bounds for “≥ r small fibres per z” cores; asymptotic e^{-r} factor)
Let σ_1,…,σ_r∈S_k and let A be the k×k 0–1 matrix with ones exactly off the union of the r permutation matrices M(σ_j). Let t:=k−r be the row/column sum of A. Then the number of permutations avoiding all forbidden cells equals per(A), and
(t/k)^k k! ≤ per(A) ≤ (t!)^{k/t}.
Proof. Lower bound: normalize B:=A/t, a doubly-stochastic matrix. By Egorychev–Falikman (van der Waerden), per(B)≥k!/k^k; hence per(A)=t^k per(B)≥(t/k)^k k!. Upper bound: by Brégman, per(A)≤∏_{i=1}^k (t!)^{1/t}=(t!)^{k/t}.
Asymptotics. By Stirling, per(A)=e^{-r+o(1)}k! as k→∞ with fixed r. Thus the factorial core size |E_0(r)| is Θ(e^{-r}k!).
Corollary 3 (robust factorial counterexamples for ≥r-small-fibres variant, n=1)
Let E_0(r):={π∈S_k : π(i)≠σ_j(i) ∀i,j}. Define f_i(π)=π(i). Then for each z and for the r indices t_j:=σ_j^{-1}(z), |f_{t_j}^{-1}(z)|=0, so the strengthened hypothesis (≥r small fibres per z, with n=1) holds. By the Lemma, G is complete and χ(G)=|E_0(r)|=e^{-r+o(1)}k!.

Examples
- k=3, n=1 (fixed-transversal): E=D_3∪{(12),(13),(23)} has |E|=5=χ(G)>2·1+1.
- General r: For fixed r and large k, |E|=χ(G)≥((1−r/k)^k)k!=e^{-r+o(1)}k! with n=1 and ≥r indices per z having fibre 0.

Obstacles and corrections
- The “pinned completion through a forbidden cell” (constructing permutations using exactly one forbidden edge) is delicate; existence is not guaranteed by regularity of the allowed graph alone. We avoid quantitative claims here; factorial cores E_0(r) suffice for strong counterexamples.
- Surjectivity of each f_i in the n=1 construction holds when τ=id (after renaming), since derangements cover all z≠i in row i and the single-fixed permutation covers z=i.

Next steps
- Add proofs of Proposition 1 and Theorem 2 to proofs.md with precise citations (Egorychev–Falikman, Brégman) and Stirling asymptotics. This documents that our cores are asymptotically optimal among t-regular allowed patterns.
- Investigate near-tight constructions for the uniform r-to-1 regime (|f_i^{-1}(z)|=r for all i,z) against the corrected pair-coverage upper bound |E|≤r k(k−1)+1.
- Explore additional regularity constraints (e.g., each f_i surjective) and quantify the maximal χ in terms of k under these constraints (projective planes give Θ(k^2) at n=1).
