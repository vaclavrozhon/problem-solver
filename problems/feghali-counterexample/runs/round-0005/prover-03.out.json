  "content": "Ideas\n- Maintain the conflict-graph perspective: a valid partition is a proper coloring; the minimum number of parts equals \u03c7(G). We seek instances with small n (ideally n=1) but \u03c7(G) as large as possible, and test robustness under natural regularity constraints (surjectivity, uniform fibres).\n- Two complementary lines: (i) factorial-size complete graphs with n=1 via permutation avoidance (allowing zero fibres); (ii) bijective/uniform fibres with n=1 via incidence designs, where a quadratic upper bound is tight.\n\nRigorous tools and results (new and consolidated)\nLemma (pair-coverage inequality; complete G). Let a_i(z):=|f_i^{-1}(z)| and m:=|E|. If the conflict graph G is complete, then\nm(m\u22121) \u2264 \u2211_{z\u2208F} [ (\u2211_{i=1}^k a_i(z))^2 \u2212 \u2211_{i=1}^k a_i(z)^2 ].\nProof. For fixed z, the number of unordered pairs {x,y} with x\u2208f_p^{-1}(z), y\u2208f_q^{-1}(z), p\u2260q, equals \u2211_{p<q} a_p(z)a_q(z) = 1/2[(\u2211_i a_i(z))^2 \u2212 \u2211_i a_i(z)^2]. Summing over z, every unordered pair {x,y} is counted at least once (completeness), hence the claim.\n\nProposition (uniform r-to-1 upper bound; corrected). If for all i,z we have |f_i^{-1}(z)|=r\u22651 (so each f_i is surjective with constant fibre r) and G is complete, then\n|E| \u2264 r k (k\u22121) + 1.\nProof. Let u:=|F| and m:=|E|. Then m=\u2211_z a_i(z)=ru for each i, so m=ru. The inequality gives m(m\u22121) \u2264 \u2211_z ( (kr)^2 \u2212 kr^2 ) = u\u00b7kr^2(k\u22121). Divide by ur: r u \u2212 1 \u2264 r k (k\u22121), i.e. m=ru \u2264 r k (k\u22121) + 1.\n\nGroup/difference-set viewpoint (bijective regime; n=1, completeness). Let F be an abelian group of order v and choose distinct g_1,\u2026,g_k\u2208F. Put E:=F and define f_i(x)=x+g_i. Then each f_i is a bijection and pointwise distinctness holds. The conflict condition f_p(x)=f_q(y) is y\u2212x=g_p\u2212g_q. Hence G is complete iff {g_p\u2212g_q : p\u2260q}=F\\{0}, i.e. {g_i} is a (v,k,1) difference set. Singer difference sets exist for v=k^2\u2212k+1 (projective planes), giving \u03c7(G)=v and n=1, matching the bijective upper bound.\n\nSharp counterexamples and necessary linear coefficients in n\nTheorem (factorial lower bound on any linear-in-n bound). Fix k\u22653 and r\u2208{0,1,\u2026,k\u22121}. For any function c(k), if one claims \u03c7(G)\u2264c(k)\u00b7n for all instances satisfying \u201cfor every z there exist at least r indices t with |f_t^{-1}(z)|\u2264n\u201d, then necessarily\nc(k) \u2265 (1\u2212r/k)^k \u00b7 k!.\nProof. Use the permutation template f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i) with F=[k]. Let P_1,\u2026,P_r be r disjoint permutation matrices; let A be the complement (row/column sums k\u2212r). Let E_0(r) be the set of permutations avoiding P_1\u222a\u2026\u222aP_r. By Egorychev\u2013Falikman (van der Waerden), |E_0(r)|=per(A) \u2265 (1\u2212r/k)^k k!. For any distinct \u03c0,\u03c3\u2208E_0(r), choose s with \u03c0^{-1}(s)\u2260\u03c3^{-1}(s), so the conflict graph on E_0(r) is complete. For each z and each j\u2264r, the unique row t_j(z) covered by P_j at column z is forbidden, so f_{t_j(z)}^{-1}(z)=\u2205. Thus the hypothesis holds with n=1 (indeed r indices have fibre 0), and \u03c7(G)=|E_0(r)|. Any bound \u03c7\u2264c(k)\u00b7n at n=1 yields c(k)\u2265|E_0(r)|, proving the claim.\nCorollary (r=1). Any universal bound of the form \u03c7(G)\u2264c(k)\u00b7n must satisfy c(k)\u2265(1\u22121/k)^k k!\u2248e^{\u22121}k!.\n\nDesign-based counterexamples under maximal regularity (n=1, all fibres 1)\nLemma (bipartite-incidence template). Let H be a k-regular bipartite graph with parts (E,F) that admits a proper k-edge-coloring into perfect matchings M_1,\u2026,M_k. Define f_i(x) as the unique neighbor of x via M_i. Then: (i) pointwise distinctness holds; (ii) |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all i,z (so n=1 and no zero fibres); (iii) if every two x\u2260y\u2208E have a common neighbor in H, the conflict graph is complete.\nExample (projective planes). For k=q+1 (q a prime power), take H the incidence bipartite graph of PG(2,q). Then |E|=|F|=v=k^2\u2212k+1; \u03c7(G)=v and n=1. This saturates the bijective upper bound and is optimal in this regime.\n\nCaveat: why uniform r>1 blow-ups fail. Replacing each left vertex x by r copies while keeping f_i dependent only on the base x forces non-adjacency among pairs of copies of the same x (they cannot conflict without violating pointwise distinctness). Hence completeness fails. This aligns with the uniform r-to-1 upper bound |E|\u2264r k(k\u22121)+1.\n\nSmall explicit examples (checkable)\n- k=3, n=1, bijective: Fano plane PG(2,2); |E|=7; \u03c7(G)=7>3.\n- k=3, n=1, factorial (allowing zeros): E={(123),(132),(23),(13),(12)}; \u03c7(G)=5>3.\n- k=4, n=1, factorial core r=1: derangements D_4=9 yield \u03c7(G)=9>3.\n- k=7 (PG(3,2) hyperplanes vs points): k=7, |E|=|F|=15; n=1; \u03c7(G)=15>3.\n\nObstacles/limits\n- In the bijective/uniform regime, the quadratic ceiling is tight (projective planes); superquadratic \u03c7 with n=1 requires allowing zero fibres (permutation cores).\n- Uniform r-to-1 near-tight examples beyond r=1 remain open; naive blow-ups break completeness.\n\nNext steps\n- Add to proofs.md: (i) pair-coverage inequality; (ii) corrected uniform r-to-1 bound; (iii) factorial-linear-coefficient theorem above; (iv) difference-set formulation and Singer construction.\n- Seek constructions under \u201ceach f_i surjective\u201d (not necessarily uniform) that maximize \u03c7, and upper bounds via the pair-coverage inequality optimized over {a_i(z)} with constraints \u2211_z a_i(z)=m and min_i a_i(z)\u2264n.\n- Explore existence of complete-G constructions near the uniform r-to-1 ceiling for r\u22652 (possibly via group-theoretic or design-theoretic gadgets beyond simple blow-ups).\n"
