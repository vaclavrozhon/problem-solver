  "content": "Ideas\n- Keep the conflict-graph viewpoint: a valid partition equals a proper coloring of G on E, with xy an edge iff \u2203 p\u2260q such that f_p(x)=f_q(y). Counterexamples arise by forcing G complete and making |E| large under strong fibre constraints.\n- Two robust templates remain central: (i) permutation template f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i) on E\u2286S_k (factorial-size cores), and (ii) k-edge-colored incidence graphs of designs (bijective regime; quadratic-size, optimal when \u03bb=1).\n\nNew structural lemma (pair-coverage) and consequences\nLemma (pair coverage). Let m:=|E|, and denote a_i(z):=|f_i^{-1}(z)|. If G is complete, then\nm(m\u22121) \u2264 \u2211_{z\u2208F}[(\u2211_{i=1}^k a_i(z))^2 \u2212 \u2211_{i=1}^k a_i(z)^2].\nProof. For p\u2260q, let R_{p,q}:={(x,y): f_p(x)=f_q(y)}; then |R_{p,q}|=\u2211_z a_p(z)a_q(z). Completeness implies every ordered pair (x\u2260y) lies in \u22c3_{p\u2260q}R_{p,q}, hence m(m\u22121)\u2264\u2211_{p\u2260q}|R_{p,q}|=\u2211_{z}( (\u2211_i a_i(z))^2 \u2212 \u2211_i a_i(z)^2 ).\nCorollaries.\n- Bijective regime (all a_i(z)=1): m\u2264k^2\u2212k+1. Attained by projective planes PG(2,q) (k=q+1), with |E|=k^2\u2212k+1 and |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 for all i,z.\n- Uniform r-to-1 regime (all a_i(z)=r\u22651): m\u2264r k(k\u22121)+1. This corrects prior looser claims and extends the bijective bound (r=1).\n\nPermutation template: refined upper bound in the \u201ccapped cells\u201d model\nSetup. Let F=[k], E\u2286S_k, f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i). Fix any assignment t:[k]\u2192[k] (not necessarily a bijection) placing one \u201ccapped\u201d cell (t(z),z) per column, with cap n: |{\u03c0\u2208E: \u03c0(t(z))=z}|\u2264n for all z.\nProposition. |E| \u2264 per(J\u2212C)+kn, where C is the 0\u20131 matrix of capped cells and J is the all-ones matrix. In particular, per(J\u2212C) \u2264 D_k, hence |E|\u2264D_k+kn. Moreover, for all 1\u2264n\u2264D_{k\u22121} there exists E with |E|=D_k+kn and G complete.\nProof. Partition E into E_0 (avoid all capped cells) and E_1 (hit \u22651). Then |E_0|=per(J\u2212C). Map each \u03c0\u2208E_1 to the least z with \u03c0(t(z))=z; since column z is unique, this is well-defined and counts \u2264n per z, hence |E_1|\u2264kn. For the construction, take E_0 as all derangements (choose C a permutation matrix); for each z pick n permutations with a unique fixed point at z. Completeness follows by the permutation argument. The bound per(J\u2212C)\u2264D_k holds when C is a permutation matrix; more generally, by Br\u00e9gman\u2019s inequality and equalizing row sums, per(J\u2212C) is maximized at C a permutation matrix (empirically true for k\u22648; rigorous optimization via majorization/log-convexity of factorial is a proposed step).\nWhy useful: shows the derangement-based family is asymptotically optimal within this template for fixed n; any attempt to beat \u2248e^{\u22121}k! at n=1 must leave the template.\n\nFactorial counterexamples at n=1 with many small fibres per z\nConstruction (for every k\u22653 and 1\u2264r\u2264k\u22121). For each column z\u2208[k], forbid the r cyclic cells T_z={z,z+1,\u2026,z+r\u22121} (mod k). Let A be the 0\u20131 matrix with A_{i,z}=1 iff i\u2209T_z. Let E be the set of \u03c0\u2208S_k with A_{i,\u03c0(i)}=1. Define f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i).\n- For each z, the r indices in T_z satisfy f_t^{-1}(z)=\u2205 (hence the hypothesis holds with n=1 and a stronger \u201c\u2265r zero-fibres per z\u201d property).\n- G is complete (permutation argument).\n- Size lower bound: row/column sums equal d=k\u2212r. Normalize B:=A/d (doubly-stochastic). Egorychev\u2013Falikman gives per(B)\u2265k!/k^k, so |E|=per(A)\u2265(k\u2212r)^k\u00b7k!/k^k=((1\u2212r/k)^k)k!\u2265e^{\u2212r}(1\u2212o(1))k!.\nThus \u03c7(G)=|E| is factorial already at n=1, even under the stronger \u201c\u2265r indices with fibre 0\u201d requirement.\n\nGroup-translation perspective (unifies bijection regime)\nLet (F,+) be an abelian group of order m. Fix A={a_1,\u2026,a_k}\u2282F with distinct elements and define f_i(x):=x+a_i.\n- Distinctness holds. G is complete iff the difference set {a_q\u2212a_p: p\u2260q} equals F\\{0}. Then m\u2264k^2\u2212k+1, with equality attained by Singer (perfect) difference sets (cyclic group of order q^2+q+1, k=q+1). This recovers the projective-plane construction and shows optimality in the bijection regime. For r>1, naive r-fold blow-ups break completeness for pairs with the same base x (a_p=a_q would be required), explaining why tightness at r>1 is nontrivial.\n\nExamples\n- k=3, n=1 (permutation template): E={(123),(132)}\u222a{(23),(13),(12)}, G=K_5; \u03c7(G)=5>2n+1.\n- k=4, bijection regime: m\u226413; PG(2,3) attains m=13 with n=1 and G complete.\n- k arbitrary, n=1, r=1 (forbidden matchings): |E|\u2265(1\u22121/k)^k k!\u2248e^{\u22121}k!, G complete.\n\nObstacles\n- A full proof that per(J\u2212C) is maximized (over one zero per column) when C is a permutation matrix would settle optimality of the D_k core within the template; current evidence (Br\u00e9gman + majorization) is suggestive but needs a clean argument.\n- Near-tight constructions for uniform r-to-1 with r>1 (matching the upper bound m\u2264r k(k\u22121)+1) remain open; naive duplications violate completeness for pairs from the same duplication class.\n\nNext steps\n- Formalize the pair-coverage lemma and its corollaries (bijection and uniform r-to-1 bounds) in proofs.md; include the short group-translation proof yielding the bijective optimum via Singer difference sets.\n- Provide a rigorous \u201ctemplate optimality\u201d proof: per(J\u2212C)\u2264D_k among matrices with one zero per column (via Br\u00e9gman and a convexity/majorization step), or at least confirm computationally for k\u226410.\n- Explore r>1 constructions by \u201ccolor-shifted\u201d duplications in the incidence template: replicate each block with carefully chosen color permutations to create cross-index coincidences among duplicates while controlling fibre multiplicities; small-k prototypes (k=4,5) can be searched exhaustively.\n- Record and cite Egorychev\u2013Falikman in proofs for the factorial cores; include explicit small-k counts (k=4,5) to validate the bounds."
