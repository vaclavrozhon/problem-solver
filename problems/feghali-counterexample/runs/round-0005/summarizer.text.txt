{"summary_md":"Recast the partition problem via the conflict graph G (vertices E; edge x–y iff ∃ p≠q with f_p(x)=f_q(y)), so required parts = χ(G). Main findings: (i) Permutation template f_i(π)=π(i) on E⊆S_k gives G complete, n*=(k−1)!, χ=k! so χ=k·n* (hence any universal linear bound χ≤c(k)n* must have c(k)≥k). (ii) A derangement-augmented variant yields prescribed n with complete G and χ=D_k+kn (e.g. k=3,n=1 → K5). (iii) Projective-plane (k=q+1) gives |f_i^{-1}(z)|=1 ∀i,z but G complete on k^2−k+1 vertices (n*=1) — tight in the bijection regime. (iv) Forbidding r permutation matchings yields factorial cores E_0(r) with |E|≥((1−r/k)^k)k! (van der Waerden), so strengthened small-fibre conditions still admit factorial χ. Pair-coverage yields upper bounds m≤k^2−k+1 (bijective) and corrected uniform r-to-1 bound m≤r k(k−1)+1.
