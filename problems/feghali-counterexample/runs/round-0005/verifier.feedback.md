The counterexample landscape is now solid along two axes. First, the permutation template f_i(π)=π(i) with E⊆S_k yields complete conflict graphs for any E, so χ(G)=|E|. Within a fixed-transversal framework (choose a bijection τ:F→[k] and cap |{π∈E:π(τ(z))=z}|≤n), the sharp bound |E|≤D_k+kn with matching constructions is correct. It produces n*=n and χ=|D_k|+kn, hence factorial χ already for n=1 (k=3 gives K5). This also yields a strong coefficient lower bound for any putative χ≤c(k)·n*, namely c(k)≥D_k+k≈e^{-1}k!.
Second, the “many small fibres per z” variant is handled rigorously: forbidding r permutation matchings and applying Egorychev–Falikman gives a factorial-sized core E_0(r) with |E_0(r)|≥((1−r/k)^k)k!, and Brégman’s inequality supplies a matching upper bound up to subexponential factors, so |E_0(r)|=e^{−r+o(1)}k!. The conflict graph remains complete, and for every z there are ≥r zero-fibre indices; thus even strengthened hypotheses fail dramatically at n=1.
For the regime of maximal regularity (all fibres 1), the incidence/design template is correct. The pair-coverage inequality cleanly yields the tight bijective bound |E|≤k^2−k+1, attained by projective planes. The corrected uniform r-to-1 bound |E|≤r k(k−1)+1 follows from the same inequality.
Caveats: (i) “Pinned completions” through a forbidden cell are not justified by regularity of the allowed graph; use Hall/LLL/rook-polynomials for existence or omit quantitative claims. (ii) Surjectivity of each f_i in the permutation construction requires τ=id (after renaming); do not state it in general. (iii) Any attempt to generalize the D_k core beyond a fixed transversal needs a rigorous permanent optimization; otherwise restrict claims to the τ-bijective setting.
Next steps: (1) Add a formal two-sided bound (van der Waerden + Brégman) for |E_0(r)| (appended). (2) Pursue existence (even one each) of pinned completions via Hall/LLL to extend to prescribed n>1 under the ≥r-small-fibres variant. (3) Seek constructions near the uniform r-to-1 ceiling for r≥2 or prove stronger upper bounds under extra structure (e.g., balanced overlaps/surjectivity). (4) Optionally, formalize the group/difference-set viewpoint for bijective extremals.
