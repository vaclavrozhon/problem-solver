  "feedback_md": "The counterexample landscape is now solid along two axes. First, the permutation template f_i(\u03c0)=\u03c0(i) with E\u2286S_k yields complete conflict graphs for any E, so \u03c7(G)=|E|. Within a fixed-transversal framework (choose a bijection \u03c4:F\u2192[k] and cap |{\u03c0\u2208E:\u03c0(\u03c4(z))=z}|\u2264n), the sharp bound |E|\u2264D_k+kn with matching constructions is correct. It produces n*=n and \u03c7=|D_k|+kn, hence factorial \u03c7 already for n=1 (k=3 gives K5). This also yields a strong coefficient lower bound for any putative \u03c7\u2264c(k)\u00b7n*, namely c(k)\u2265D_k+k\u2248e^{-1}k!.\nSecond, the \u201cmany small fibres per z\u201d variant is handled rigorously: forbidding r permutation matchings and applying Egorychev\u2013Falikman gives a factorial-sized core E_0(r) with |E_0(r)|\u2265((1\u2212r/k)^k)k!, and Br\u00e9gman\u2019s inequality supplies a matching upper bound up to subexponential factors, so |E_0(r)|=e^{\u2212r+o(1)}k!. The conflict graph remains complete, and for every z there are \u2265r zero-fibre indices; thus even strengthened hypotheses fail dramatically at n=1.\nFor the regime of maximal regularity (all fibres 1), the incidence/design template is correct. The pair-coverage inequality cleanly yields the tight bijective bound |E|\u2264k^2\u2212k+1, attained by projective planes. The corrected uniform r-to-1 bound |E|\u2264r k(k\u22121)+1 follows from the same inequality.\nCaveats: (i) \u201cPinned completions\u201d through a forbidden cell are not justified by regularity of the allowed graph; use Hall/LLL/rook-polynomials for existence or omit quantitative claims. (ii) Surjectivity of each f_i in the permutation construction requires \u03c4=id (after renaming); do not state it in general. (iii) Any attempt to generalize the D_k core beyond a fixed transversal needs a rigorous permanent optimization; otherwise restrict claims to the \u03c4-bijective setting.\nNext steps: (1) Add a formal two-sided bound (van der Waerden + Br\u00e9gman) for |E_0(r)| (appended). (2) Pursue existence (even one each) of pinned completions via Hall/LLL to extend to prescribed n>1 under the \u2265r-small-fibres variant. (3) Seek constructions near the uniform r-to-1 ceiling for r\u22652 or prove stronger upper bounds under extra structure (e.g., balanced overlaps/surjectivity). (4) Optionally, formalize the group/difference-set viewpoint for bijective extremals.",

In the bijective regime (all fibres 1), the pair-coverage inequality gives |E|\u2264k^2\u2212k+1, tight for projective planes. The corrected uniform r-to-1 bound is |E|\u2264r k(k\u22121)+1.
