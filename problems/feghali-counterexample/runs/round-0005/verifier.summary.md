Permutation-based complete graphs give χ=|D_k|+kn with n*=n (factorial at n=1). For the “≥r small fibres per z” variant, forbidding r matchings yields |E|=e^{−r+o(1)}k! by van der Waerden and Brégman, still with complete G at n=1. In the bijective regime (all fibres 1), the pair-coverage inequality gives |E|≤k^2−k+1, tight for projective planes. The corrected uniform r-to-1 bound is |E|≤r k(k−1)+1. Pinned-completion counts remain open; surjectivity claims must be scoped (τ=id).
