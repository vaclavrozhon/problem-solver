Then at q=\u03b6_N,\\n- the q-power factor is \u03b6_N^{r(r\u2212s)} (depends only on residues),\\n- q-Lucas gives \\\\qbinom{n+i}{2i}_{\u03b6_N} = \\\\binom{x+y+c}{2y+\u03b4}\\\\,\\\\qbinom{a_0}{b_0}_{\u03b6_N}.\\nTherefore\\n  f_{xN+s}(\u03b6_N)=\\\\sum_{r=0}^{N-1} \u03b6_N^{r(r-s)}\\\\,\\\\qbinom{a_0}{b_0}_{\u03b6_N}\\\\,\\\\sum_{y\u22650}\\\\binom{x+y+c}{2y+\u03b4}.\\nBy the Fibonacci sums,\\n  \\\\[f_{xN+s}(\u03b6_N)=\\\\sum_{r=0}^{N-1} \u03b6_N^{r(r-s)}\\\\,\\\\qbinom{a_0}{b_0}_{\u03b6_N}\\\\,F_{2x+2c+1-\u03b4}.\\\\]\\nEquivalently, there exist constants (depending only on s,N)\\n  A_s=\\\\sum_{r:\u03b4=1} \u03b6_N^{r(r-s)}\\\\,\\\\qbinom{a_0}{b_0}_{\u03b6_N},\\n  B_s=\\\\sum_{r:\u03b4=0} \u03b6_N^{r(r-s)}\\\\,\\\\qbinom{a_0}{b_0}_{\u03b6_N},\\n  C_s=\\\\sum_{r:\u03b4=1,c=1} \u03b6_N^{r(r-s)}\\\\,\\\\qbinom{a_0}{b_0}_{\u03b6_N}\\n(since the case \u03b4=0,c=1 contributes 0), such that\\n  \\\\[g_s(x):=f_{xN+s}(\u03b6_N)=A_sF_{2x}+B_sF_{2x+1}+C_sF_{2x+2}.\\\\]\\nIn particular, for every s the arithmetic-progression subsequence n\u2261s (mod N) satisfies the fixed linear recurrence\\n  g_s(x+2)=3\\\\,g_s(x+1)\u2212g_s(x) for all x\u22650.\\nThis follows from F_{n+4}=3F_{n+2}\u2212F_n and linearity.\\n\\nImmediate obstruction to periodicity\\n- If a_N(n) had period dividing 2N in n, then for each residue s the subsequence g_s(x)=a_N(xN+s) would have period dividing 2 in x, i.e. g_s(x+2)=g_s(x) for all x.\\n- Combining with the proven recurrence g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)\u2212g_s(x) yields 0=(g_s(x+2)\u2212g_s(x))=3g_s(x+1)\u22122g_s(x) for all x, hence also 0=3g_s(x)\u22122g_s(x\u22121), and so on; solving forces g_s(x)\u22610. But g_s is not identically 0 (e.g., g_0(0)=f_0(\u03b6_N)=1). Contradiction.\\nTherefore the claimed periodicity fails for every N\u22651.\\n\\nConcrete counterexamples\\n- N=1 (q=1): f_n(1)=\u2211_{i=0}^n \\\\binom{n+i}{2i}=F_{2n+1} (classical), not periodic.\\n- N=2 (q=\u22121): from the decomposition, f_{2x}(\u22121)=F_{2x+1}\u2212F_{2x}=F_{2x\u22121}, f_{2x+1}(\u22121)=F_{2x+3}, again not periodic.\\n\\nRemarks and checks\\n- The single residue r=0 already contributes F_{2x+1} to g_s(x) (since \u03b6_N^{0}=1 and \\\\qbinom{s}{0}_{\u03b6_N}=1), which by itself varies with x. The full decomposition refines this and proves the recurrence rigorously.\\n- The coefficients A_s,B_s,C_s lie in the cyclotomic field Q(\u03b6_N). The recurrence has characteristic polynomial \u03bb^2\u22123\u03bb+1, whose roots (3\u00b1\u221a5)/2 are not on the unit circle; thus no nonzero solution is periodic.\\n\\nObstacles\\n- A direct n-recursion for f_n(q) at generic q seems more delicate; the residue-class method cleanly separates the arithmetic progression structure using q-Lucas.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Record the explicit decomposition and recurrence as main results; this is auditable and useful.\\n- If a modified claim is desired, one can seek periodicity modulo a prime p (Pisano-type phenomena), since g_s satisfies a fixed linear recurrence over Z[\u03b6_N]; modulo p the sequence is eventually periodic.\\n- Compute A_s,B_s,C_s explicitly for small N to illustrate the formula and to give exact closed forms for f_{xN+s}(\u03b6_N).\"}",
