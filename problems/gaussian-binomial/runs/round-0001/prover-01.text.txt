Ideas
- Reduce v-Gaussians to q-Gaussians with q=v^2, then specialize q to a root of unity. This isolates a simple q-power factor.
- Use the q-Lucas theorem at q=ζ_N to split Gaussian binomials along base-N digits. This organizes the i-sum by residue classes modulo N.
- Sum the arising ordinary binomial tails; these are classical Fibonacci sums. This yields an explicit formula for the subsequences n≡s (mod N), proving they satisfy a fixed second-order linear recurrence in the step x along the arithmetic progression.
- Conclude: no nontrivial periodicity in n can hold; indeed even the N-step subsequences are non-periodic. Provide counterexamples and a rigorous obstruction via the recurrence.

Key algebraic reduction
For integers a≥b≥0,
- [m]_v = (v^m−v^{−m})/(v−v^{−1}) = v^{1−m}(1−q^m)/(1−q), with q=v^2.
- Hence
  \[\qbinom{a}{b}_v = v^{\sum_{j=0}^{b-1}(1-(a-j)) - \sum_{j=0}^{b-1}(1-(b-j))}\prod_{j=0}^{b-1}\frac{1-q^{a-j}}{1-q^{b-j}} = v^{b(b-a)}\qbinom{a}{b}_q.\]
In particular, for a=n+i, b=2i we get
  \[\qbinom{n+i}{2i}_v = q^{i(i-n)}\qbinom{n+i}{2i}_q.\]
Thus
  \[f_n(q)=\sum_{i=0}^n q^{i(i-n)}\qbinom{n+i}{2i}_q.\]

q-Lucas at a primitive N-th root
Let q=ζ_N and write a=a_1N+a_0, b=b_1N+b_0 with 0≤a_0,b_0<N. Then the q-Lucas theorem (specialized to evaluation at ζ_N) gives
  \[\qbinom{a}{b}_{ζ_N} = \binom{a_1}{b_1}\,\qbinom{a_0}{b_0}_{ζ_N}\]
(with convention 0 if b_0>a_0). Sketch: write q-factorials via (q;q)_m=∏_{j=1}^m(1−q^j), group terms into N-blocks, note cancellations of factors 1−q^{jN}=0 occur in matching numbers in numerator/denominator, leaving the ordinary binomial from block-count and the residue Gaussian from the remainders.

Fibonacci diagonal sums
Define for x≥0 and δ,c∈{0,1}
  S_{δ,c}(x)=\sum_{y≥0}\binom{x+y+c}{2y+δ}.
A standard induction using Pascal’s identity yields
  - S_{0,0}(x)=F_{2x+1},
  - S_{1,0}(x)=F_{2x},
  - S_{1,1}(x)=F_{2x+2},
  - S_{0,1}(x)=F_{2x+3},
where F_m is the Fibonacci sequence (F_0=0,F_1=1). Proof outline: set S_0(x)=∑\binom{x+y}{2y}, S_1(x)=∑\binom{x+y}{2y+1}. Pascal gives S_0(x+1)=S_0(x)+S_1(x) and S_1(x+1)=S_1(x)+S_0(x), with S_0(0)=1,S_1(0)=0; hence S_0(x)=F_{2x+1}, S_1(x)=F_{2x}. The c=1 cases follow by another Pascal step.

Residue-class decomposition
Fix N, write n=xN+s with 0≤s<N. For i=yN+r with 0≤r<N, set δ=⌊2r/N⌋∈{0,1}, c=⌊(s+r)/N⌋∈{0,1}, a_0=s+r−cN, b_0=2r−δN. Then at q=ζ_N,
- the q-power factor is ζ_N^{r(r−s)} (depends only on residues),
- q-Lucas gives \qbinom{n+i}{2i}_{ζ_N} = \binom{x+y+c}{2y+δ}\,\qbinom{a_0}{b_0}_{ζ_N}.
Therefore
  f_{xN+s}(ζ_N)=\sum_{r=0}^{N-1} ζ_N^{r(r-s)}\,\qbinom{a_0}{b_0}_{ζ_N}\,\sum_{y≥0}\binom{x+y+c}{2y+δ}.
By the Fibonacci sums,
  \[f_{xN+s}(ζ_N)=\sum_{r=0}^{N-1} ζ_N^{r(r-s)}\,\qbinom{a_0}{b_0}_{ζ_N}\,F_{2x+2c+1-δ}.\]
Equivalently, there exist constants (depending only on s,N)
  A_s=\sum_{r:δ=1} ζ_N^{r(r-s)}\,\qbinom{a_0}{b_0}_{ζ_N},
  B_s=\sum_{r:δ=0} ζ_N^{r(r-s)}\,\qbinom{a_0}{b_0}_{ζ_N},
  C_s=\sum_{r:δ=1,c=1} ζ_N^{r(r-s)}\,\qbinom{a_0}{b_0}_{ζ_N}
(since the case δ=0,c=1 contributes 0), such that
  \[g_s(x):=f_{xN+s}(ζ_N)=A_sF_{2x}+B_sF_{2x+1}+C_sF_{2x+2}.\]
In particular, for every s the arithmetic-progression subsequence n≡s (mod N) satisfies the fixed linear recurrence
  g_s(x+2)=3\,g_s(x+1)−g_s(x) for all x≥0.
This follows from F_{n+4}=3F_{n+2}−F_n and linearity.

Immediate obstruction to periodicity
- If a_N(n) had period dividing 2N in n, then for each residue s the subsequence g_s(x)=a_N(xN+s) would have period dividing 2 in x, i.e. g_s(x+2)=g_s(x) for all x.
- Combining with the proven recurrence g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)−g_s(x) yields 0=(g_s(x+2)−g_s(x))=3g_s(x+1)−2g_s(x) for all x, hence also 0=3g_s(x)−2g_s(x−1), and so on; solving forces g_s(x)≡0. But g_s is not identically 0 (e.g., g_0(0)=f_0(ζ_N)=1). Contradiction.
Therefore the claimed periodicity fails for every N≥1.

Concrete counterexamples
- N=1 (q=1): f_n(1)=∑_{i=0}^n \binom{n+i}{2i}=F_{2n+1} (classical), not periodic.
- N=2 (q=−1): from the decomposition, f_{2x}(−1)=F_{2x+1}−F_{2x}=F_{2x−1}, f_{2x+1}(−1)=F_{2x+3}, again not periodic.

Remarks and checks
- The single residue r=0 already contributes F_{2x+1} to g_s(x) (since ζ_N^{0}=1 and \qbinom{s}{0}_{ζ_N}=1), which by itself varies with x. The full decomposition refines this and proves the recurrence rigorously.
- The coefficients A_s,B_s,C_s lie in the cyclotomic field Q(ζ_N). The recurrence has characteristic polynomial λ^2−3λ+1, whose roots (3±√5)/2 are not on the unit circle; thus no nonzero solution is periodic.

Obstacles
- A direct n-recursion for f_n(q) at generic q seems more delicate; the residue-class method cleanly separates the arithmetic progression structure using q-Lucas.

Next steps
- Record the explicit decomposition and recurrence as main results; this is auditable and useful.
- If a modified claim is desired, one can seek periodicity modulo a prime p (Pisano-type phenomena), since g_s satisfies a fixed linear recurrence over Z[ζ_N]; modulo p the sequence is eventually periodic.
- Compute A_s,B_s,C_s explicitly for small N to illustrate the formula and to give exact closed forms for f_{xN+s}(ζ_N).
