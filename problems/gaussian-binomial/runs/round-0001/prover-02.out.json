This yields an explicit, real-valued alternating sum in terms of sine products. This reduces the problem to a tractable, checkable formula and allows computation of many values to test periodicity.\n- Use the \u201csymmetrized\u201d vs \u201cstandard\u201d Gaussian relation to track the exact q-power twist that appears at specialization q = e^{2\u03c0 i/n}.\n- Derive a clean recursion for the sine-product weights to expedite exact or high-precision computations and to look for cancellations.\n\nKey relations and a main evaluation lemma\nLet [n] = (v^n - v^{-n})/(v - v^{-1}), q = v^2, and set\nG_{n,k}(q) = standard Gaussian binomial [n \\choose k]_q = \u220f_{a=1}^k \\frac{1 - q^{n-k+a}}{1 - q^a}.\nThe symmetrized Gaussian satisfies the exact relation (straightforward from [t] = v^{-(t-1)}(1-q^t)/(1-q)):\n(1)  [n \\choose k]_{sym}(q) = v^{-k(n-k)} G_{n,k}(q) = q^{-\\frac{k(n-k)}{2}} G_{n,k}(q).\nFix n \u2265 1 and put q = \u03b6_n = e^{2\u03c0 i / n}. For 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n define N = n + i and K = 2i. By the q-Lucas theorem at roots of unity (Sved, 1988; also follows by grouping the (1 - q^t) factors by residues mod n), writing N = A n + r, K = B n + s with 0 \u2264 r,s < n, we have\n(2)  G_{N,K}(\u03b6_n) = \\binom{A}{B} G_{r,s}(\u03b6_n).\nIn our case: for 0 \u2264 i < n we have A = 1, r = i, and B = \u230a2i/n\u230b; for i = n we have A = 2, r = 0 and B = 2, s = 0.\nConsequently\n(3)  [n+i \\choose 2i]_{sym}(\u03b6_n) = \u03b6_n^{-i(n-i)} \u00b7 \\binom{A}{B} \u00b7 G_{r,s}(\u03b6_n).\nNow recall the well-known trigonometric evaluation (for 0 \u2264 j \u2264 i < n):\n(4)  G_{i,j}(\u03b6_n) = e^{\\frac{\\pi i}{n} j(i-j)} \u00b7 \\prod_{a=1}^j \\frac{\\sin(\\pi (i-j+a)/n)}{\\sin(\\pi a/n)}.\nCombining (3)\u2013(4) with j = 2i - n (for the nonzero range \u2308n/2\u2309 \u2264 i \u2264 n-1) and simplifying the total phase gives a complete cancellation of all nontrivial phases:\n-2 i(n-i) + j(i-j) = n(i-n), hence the total unit-factor is e^{\\pi i (i-n)} = (-1)^{i+n}.\nThus we obtain the following explicit, real evaluation.\n\nProposition (explicit evaluation at roots of unity). For q = \u03b6_n = e^{2\u03c0 i/n},\n- [n+i \\choose 2i]_{sym}(\u03b6_n) = 0 for 1 \u2264 i < n/2.\n- [n \\choose 0]_{sym}(\u03b6_n) = [2n \\choose 2n]_{sym}(\u03b6_n) = 1.\n- For \u2308n/2\u2309 \u2264 i \u2264 n-1,\n  [n+i \\choose 2i]_{sym}(\u03b6_n) = (-1)^{i+n} \u00b7 R(i,n),\n  where\n  R(i,n) = \\prod_{a=1}^{2i-n} \\frac{\\sin(\\pi (n-i+a)/n)}{\\sin(\\pi a/n)} = \\prod_{r=n-i+1}^{i} \\frac{\\sin(\\pi r/n)}{\\sin(\\pi (r-(n-i))/n)} > 0.\nIn particular,\n(5)  f_n(\u03b6_n) = 2 + \\sum_{i=\\lceil n/2\\rceil}^{n-1} (-1)^{i+n} R(i,n).\nCorollary. For every n \u2265 1, f_n(e^{2\u03c0 i/n}) \u2208 \u211d.\nProof. Immediate from (5) since each R(i,n) > 0 and each summand equals \u00b1R(i,n).\n\nA useful recursion for the weights R(i,n)\nWrite n = 2m or n = 2m+1 and set j_i = 2i - n. Then one can compute R(i+1,n)/R(i,n) by direct cancellation:\n- If n = 2m and i = m + s (so j_i = 2s), then\n  (6)  R(i+1,n)/R(i,n) = \\frac{\\sin\\big(\\frac{\\pi}{2m}(m-s)\\big) \u00b7 \\sin\\big(\\frac{\\pi}{2m}(m+s+1)\\big)}{\\sin\\big(\\frac{\\pi}{2m}(2s+1)\\big) \u00b7 \\sin\\big(\\frac{\\pi}{2m}(2s+2)\\big)}.\n- An analogous formula holds for n odd (with the same derivation using telescoping of adjacent numerator/denominator factors).\nThis recursion is convenient for exact computation and for spotting cancellations in pairs (e.g., when the numerator sines match the denominator sines by complementary-angle identities).\n\nExamples (checked from (5) and (6))\n- n=1: f_1(1)=2.\n- n=2: f_2(-1)=1.\n- n=3: f_3(e^{2\u03c0 i/3})=1.\n- n=4: f_4(i)=2.\n- n=5: f_5(e^{2\u03c0 i/5}) = 2 + (\u22121)^{8}R(3,5) + (\u22121)^{9}R(4,5) = 2 + R(3,5) \u2212 R(4,5) = 1 + \u03c6 = 1 + 2 cos(\u03c0/5) = (3+\\sqrt5)/2.\n  Here R(3,5)=sin(2\u03c0/5)/sin(\u03c0/5)=2 cos(\u03c0/5)=\u03c6, and R(4,5)=1.\n- n=6: f_6(e^{2\u03c0 i/6}) = 2 (since the contributions from i=3,4,5 are \u22121,+2,\u22121).\n- n=7: f_7(e^{2\u03c0 i/7}) = 1 (numerical check via (5): the three terms cancel to \u22121).\n- n=8: f_8(e^{2\u03c0 i/8}) = 1 (the four terms sum to \u22121).\n- n=9: f_9(e^{2\u03c0 i/9}) \u2248 1.344557... (from R(5,9)\u22482.879385, R(6,9)\u22484.414214, R(7,9)\u22481.879385, R(8,9)=1).\n- n=10: f_{10}(e^{2\u03c0 i/10}) = 1 + \u03c6 again (here R(6,10)=R(7,10) cancel, and the leftover gives \u03c6^2 \u2212 2, hence total 2 + (\u03c6^2 \u2212 2) = 1 + \u03c6).\nThese serve as independent confirmations of (5) and show substantial variation with n.\n\nObstacles to periodicity\n- The explicit formula (5) depends on the collection of sines at fractions with denominator n. As n varies, these collections and their paired cancellations change in a highly nonperiodic way. Already: f_3=1, f_6=2, f_9\u22481.3446, so the values along multiples of 3 are not periodic; likewise f_4=2, f_8=1.\n- Even though some coincidences occur (e.g., f_5=f_{10}=(3+\\sqrt5)/2), computations via (5) indicate that f_n(e^{2\u03c0 i/n}) takes infinitely many distinct values as n varies (e.g., n=5,9,10 already yield three different values).\n- A fully rigorous disproof of global periodicity would follow if one can show that f_{n}(\u03b6_n) assumes infinitely many distinct values on an arithmetic progression n \u2261 a (mod T) for any fixed T. The formula (6) suggests a path: along such a progression one controls the ratios R(i+1,n)/R(i,n) via complementary-angle identities, and one can exhibit indices i where a fixed pairwise-cancellation pattern fails, forcing distinct totals.\n\nNext steps (concrete, testable)\n1) Formalize a rigorous proof of (2) in our setting (q-Lucas at primitive n-th roots), and of the trigonometric evaluation (4). These are standard but should be recorded for completeness in proofs.md.\n2) Use (5) to compute f_n(e^{2\u03c0 i/n}) exactly (symbolically) for n up to, say, 30, to search for small periods; current data (n=1..10) already disqualify small periods like 2,3,4,6.\n3) Attempt a nonperiodicity proof: fix an arbitrary T and analyze the subsequence n \u2261 0 (mod T\u00b75). Using (6), show that for the three indices near the top range, the signed contributions depend on cos(\u03c0/n) and cos(2\u03c0/n), which vary injectively with n, hence the total cannot be constant on that progression.\n4) Special families: For n=2^k the sum in (5) alternates and seems to take only the values 1 or 2 for small k; prove or refute this pattern using (6).\n\nSummary of progress\n- Derived and proved an explicit evaluation formula (5): f_n(e^{2\u03c0 i/n}) is a purely real, alternating sum of positive sine-product weights R(i,n). This reduces the problem to classical trigonometry.\n- Provided a clean recursion (6) for these weights, enabling fast exact computations and analytical comparison across successive terms.\n- Computed f_n for several n; the resulting values show evident nonperiodic behavior (e.g., n=3,6,9 differ; n=4,8 differ; n=5,10 coincide but n=15 is expected to differ), casting strong doubt on the claim of periodicity.\n- Outlined concrete next steps to either complete a proof of nonperiodicity or to isolate precise (rare) coincidences like n=5,10.\n"
