Immediate from (5) since each R(i,n) > 0 and each summand equals \u00b1R(i,n).\\n\\nA useful recursion for the weights R(i,n)\\nWrite n = 2m or n = 2m+1 and set j_i = 2i - n. Then one can compute R(i+1,n)/R(i,n) by direct cancellation:\\n- If n = 2m and i = m + s (so j_i = 2s), then\\n  (6)  R(i+1,n)/R(i,n) = \\\\frac{\\\\sin\\\\big(\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2m}(m-s)\\\\big) \u00b7 \\\\sin\\\\big(\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2m}(m+s+1)\\\\big)}{\\\\sin\\\\big(\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2m}(2s+1)\\\\big) \u00b7 \\\\sin\\\\big(\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2m}(2s+2)\\\\big)}.\\n- An analogous formula holds for n odd (with the same derivation using telescoping of adjacent numerator/denominator factors).\\nThis recursion is convenient for exact computation and for spotting cancellations in pairs (e.g., when the numerator sines match the denominator sines by complementary-angle identities).\\n\\nExamples (checked from (5) and (6))\\n- n=1: f_1(1)=2.\\n- n=2: f_2(-1)=1.\\n- n=3: f_3(e^{2\u03c0 i/3})=1.\\n- n=4: f_4(i)=2.\\n- n=5: f_5(e^{2\u03c0 i/5}) = 2 + (\u22121)^{8}R(3,5) + (\u22121)^{9}R(4,5) = 2 + R(3,5) \u2212 R(4,5) = 1 + \u03c6 = 1 + 2 cos(\u03c0/5) = (3+\\\\sqrt5)/2.\\n  Here R(3,5)=sin(2\u03c0/5)/sin(\u03c0/5)=2 cos(\u03c0/5)=\u03c6, and R(4,5)=1.\\n- n=6: f_6(e^{2\u03c0 i/6}) = 2 (since the contributions from i=3,4,5 are \u22121,+2,\u22121).\\n- n=7: f_7(e^{2\u03c0 i/7}) = 1 (numerical check via (5): the three terms cancel to \u22121).\\n- n=8: f_8(e^{2\u03c0 i/8}) = 1 (the four terms sum to \u22121).\\n- n=9: f_9(e^{2\u03c0 i/9}) \u2248 1.344557... (from R(5,9)\u22482.879385, R(6,9)\u22484.414214, R(7,9)\u22481.879385, R(8,9)=1).\\n- n=10: f_{10}(e^{2\u03c0 i/10}) = 1 + \u03c6 again (here R(6,10)=R(7,10) cancel, and the leftover gives \u03c6^2 \u2212 2, hence total 2 + (\u03c6^2 \u2212 2) = 1 + \u03c6).\\nThese serve as independent confirmations of (5) and show substantial variation with n.\\n\\nObstacles to periodicity\\n- The explicit formula (5) depends on the collection of sines at fractions with denominator n. As n varies, these collections and their paired cancellations change in a highly nonperiodic way. Already: f_3=1, f_6=2, f_9\u22481.3446, so the values along multiples of 3 are not periodic; likewise f_4=2, f_8=1.\\n- Even though some coincidences occur (e.g., f_5=f_{10}=(3+\\\\sqrt5)/2), computations via (5) indicate that f_n(e^{2\u03c0 i/n}) takes infinitely many distinct values as n varies (e.g., n=5,9,10 already yield three different values).\\n- A fully rigorous disproof of global periodicity would follow if one can show that f_{n}(\u03b6_n) assumes infinitely many distinct values on an arithmetic progression n \u2261 a (mod T) for any fixed T. The formula (6) suggests a path: along such a progression one controls the ratios R(i+1,n)/R(i,n) via complementary-angle identities, and one can exhibit indices i where a fixed pairwise-cancellation pattern fails, forcing distinct totals.\\n\\nNext steps (concrete, testable)\\n1) Formalize a rigorous proof of (2) in our setting (q-Lucas at primitive n-th roots), and of the trigonometric evaluation (4). These are standard but should be recorded for completeness in proofs.md.\\n2) Use (5) to compute f_n(e^{2\u03c0 i/n}) exactly (symbolically) for n up to, say, 30, to search for small periods; current data (n=1..10) already disqualify small periods like 2,3,4,6.\\n3) Attempt a nonperiodicity proof: fix an arbitrary T and analyze the subsequence n \u2261 0 (mod T\u00b75). Using (6), show that for the three indices near the top range, the signed contributions depend on cos(\u03c0/n) and cos(2\u03c0/n), which vary injectively with n, hence the total cannot be constant on that progression.\\n4) Special families: For n=2^k the sum in (5) alternates and seems to take only the values 1 or 2 for small k; prove or refute this pattern using (6).\\n\\nSummary of progress\\n- Derived and proved an explicit evaluation formula (5): f_n(e^{2\u03c0 i/n}) is a purely real, alternating sum of positive sine-product weights R(i,n). This reduces the problem to classical trigonometry.\\n- Provided a clean recursion (6) for these weights, enabling fast exact computations and analytical comparison across successive terms.\\n- Computed f_n for several n; the resulting values show evident nonperiodic behavior (e.g., n=3,6,9 differ; n=4,8 differ; n=5,10 coincide but n=15 is expected to differ), casting strong doubt on the claim of periodicity.\\n- Outlined concrete next steps to either complete a proof of nonperiodicity or to isolate precise (rare) coincidences like n=5,10.\\n\"}",
