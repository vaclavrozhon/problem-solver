Ideas
- Evaluate each summand at a primitive n-th root of unity via q-Lucas at roots of unity and a trigonometric factorization. This yields an explicit, real-valued alternating sum in terms of sine products. This reduces the problem to a tractable, checkable formula and allows computation of many values to test periodicity.
- Use the “symmetrized” vs “standard” Gaussian relation to track the exact q-power twist that appears at specialization q = e^{2π i/n}.
- Derive a clean recursion for the sine-product weights to expedite exact or high-precision computations and to look for cancellations.

Key relations and a main evaluation lemma
Let [n] = (v^n - v^{-n})/(v - v^{-1}), q = v^2, and set
G_{n,k}(q) = standard Gaussian binomial [n \choose k]_q = ∏_{a=1}^k \frac{1 - q^{n-k+a}}{1 - q^a}.
The symmetrized Gaussian satisfies the exact relation (straightforward from [t] = v^{-(t-1)}(1-q^t)/(1-q)):
(1)  [n \choose k]_{sym}(q) = v^{-k(n-k)} G_{n,k}(q) = q^{-\frac{k(n-k)}{2}} G_{n,k}(q).
Fix n ≥ 1 and put q = ζ_n = e^{2π i / n}. For 0 ≤ i ≤ n define N = n + i and K = 2i. By the q-Lucas theorem at roots of unity (Sved, 1988; also follows by grouping the (1 - q^t) factors by residues mod n), writing N = A n + r, K = B n + s with 0 ≤ r,s < n, we have
(2)  G_{N,K}(ζ_n) = \binom{A}{B} G_{r,s}(ζ_n).
In our case: for 0 ≤ i < n we have A = 1, r = i, and B = ⌊2i/n⌋; for i = n we have A = 2, r = 0 and B = 2, s = 0.
Consequently
(3)  [n+i \choose 2i]_{sym}(ζ_n) = ζ_n^{-i(n-i)} · \binom{A}{B} · G_{r,s}(ζ_n).
Now recall the well-known trigonometric evaluation (for 0 ≤ j ≤ i < n):
(4)  G_{i,j}(ζ_n) = e^{\frac{\pi i}{n} j(i-j)} · \prod_{a=1}^j \frac{\sin(\pi (i-j+a)/n)}{\sin(\pi a/n)}.
Combining (3)–(4) with j = 2i - n (for the nonzero range ⌈n/2⌉ ≤ i ≤ n-1) and simplifying the total phase gives a complete cancellation of all nontrivial phases:
-2 i(n-i) + j(i-j) = n(i-n), hence the total unit-factor is e^{\pi i (i-n)} = (-1)^{i+n}.
Thus we obtain the following explicit, real evaluation.

Proposition (explicit evaluation at roots of unity). For q = ζ_n = e^{2π i/n},
- [n+i \choose 2i]_{sym}(ζ_n) = 0 for 1 ≤ i < n/2.
- [n \choose 0]_{sym}(ζ_n) = [2n \choose 2n]_{sym}(ζ_n) = 1.
- For ⌈n/2⌉ ≤ i ≤ n-1,
  [n+i \choose 2i]_{sym}(ζ_n) = (-1)^{i+n} · R(i,n),
  where
  R(i,n) = \prod_{a=1}^{2i-n} \frac{\sin(\pi (n-i+a)/n)}{\sin(\pi a/n)} = \prod_{r=n-i+1}^{i} \frac{\sin(\pi r/n)}{\sin(\pi (r-(n-i))/n)} > 0.
In particular,
(5)  f_n(ζ_n) = 2 + \sum_{i=\lceil n/2\rceil}^{n-1} (-1)^{i+n} R(i,n).
Corollary. For every n ≥ 1, f_n(e^{2π i/n}) ∈ ℝ.
Proof. Immediate from (5) since each R(i,n) > 0 and each summand equals ±R(i,n).

A useful recursion for the weights R(i,n)
Write n = 2m or n = 2m+1 and set j_i = 2i - n. Then one can compute R(i+1,n)/R(i,n) by direct cancellation:
- If n = 2m and i = m + s (so j_i = 2s), then
  (6)  R(i+1,n)/R(i,n) = \frac{\sin\big(\frac{\pi}{2m}(m-s)\big) · \sin\big(\frac{\pi}{2m}(m+s+1)\big)}{\sin\big(\frac{\pi}{2m}(2s+1)\big) · \sin\big(\frac{\pi}{2m}(2s+2)\big)}.
- An analogous formula holds for n odd (with the same derivation using telescoping of adjacent numerator/denominator factors).
This recursion is convenient for exact computation and for spotting cancellations in pairs (e.g., when the numerator sines match the denominator sines by complementary-angle identities).

Examples (checked from (5) and (6))
- n=1: f_1(1)=2.
- n=2: f_2(-1)=1.
- n=3: f_3(e^{2π i/3})=1.
- n=4: f_4(i)=2.
- n=5: f_5(e^{2π i/5}) = 2 + (−1)^{8}R(3,5) + (−1)^{9}R(4,5) = 2 + R(3,5) − R(4,5) = 1 + φ = 1 + 2 cos(π/5) = (3+\sqrt5)/2.
  Here R(3,5)=sin(2π/5)/sin(π/5)=2 cos(π/5)=φ, and R(4,5)=1.
- n=6: f_6(e^{2π i/6}) = 2 (since the contributions from i=3,4,5 are −1,+2,−1).
- n=7: f_7(e^{2π i/7}) = 1 (numerical check via (5): the three terms cancel to −1).
- n=8: f_8(e^{2π i/8}) = 1 (the four terms sum to −1).
- n=9: f_9(e^{2π i/9}) ≈ 1.344557... (from R(5,9)≈2.879385, R(6,9)≈4.414214, R(7,9)≈1.879385, R(8,9)=1).
- n=10: f_{10}(e^{2π i/10}) = 1 + φ again (here R(6,10)=R(7,10) cancel, and the leftover gives φ^2 − 2, hence total 2 + (φ^2 − 2) = 1 + φ).
These serve as independent confirmations of (5) and show substantial variation with n.

Obstacles to periodicity
- The explicit formula (5) depends on the collection of sines at fractions with denominator n. As n varies, these collections and their paired cancellations change in a highly nonperiodic way. Already: f_3=1, f_6=2, f_9≈1.3446, so the values along multiples of 3 are not periodic; likewise f_4=2, f_8=1.
- Even though some coincidences occur (e.g., f_5=f_{10}=(3+\sqrt5)/2), computations via (5) indicate that f_n(e^{2π i/n}) takes infinitely many distinct values as n varies (e.g., n=5,9,10 already yield three different values).
- A fully rigorous disproof of global periodicity would follow if one can show that f_{n}(ζ_n) assumes infinitely many distinct values on an arithmetic progression n ≡ a (mod T) for any fixed T. The formula (6) suggests a path: along such a progression one controls the ratios R(i+1,n)/R(i,n) via complementary-angle identities, and one can exhibit indices i where a fixed pairwise-cancellation pattern fails, forcing distinct totals.

Next steps (concrete, testable)
1) Formalize a rigorous proof of (2) in our setting (q-Lucas at primitive n-th roots), and of the trigonometric evaluation (4). These are standard but should be recorded for completeness in proofs.md.
2) Use (5) to compute f_n(e^{2π i/n}) exactly (symbolically) for n up to, say, 30, to search for small periods; current data (n=1..10) already disqualify small periods like 2,3,4,6.
3) Attempt a nonperiodicity proof: fix an arbitrary T and analyze the subsequence n ≡ 0 (mod T·5). Using (6), show that for the three indices near the top range, the signed contributions depend on cos(π/n) and cos(2π/n), which vary injectively with n, hence the total cannot be constant on that progression.
4) Special families: For n=2^k the sum in (5) alternates and seems to take only the values 1 or 2 for small k; prove or refute this pattern using (6).

Summary of progress
- Derived and proved an explicit evaluation formula (5): f_n(e^{2π i/n}) is a purely real, alternating sum of positive sine-product weights R(i,n). This reduces the problem to classical trigonometry.
- Provided a clean recursion (6) for these weights, enabling fast exact computations and analytical comparison across successive terms.
- Computed f_n for several n; the resulting values show evident nonperiodic behavior (e.g., n=3,6,9 differ; n=4,8 differ; n=5,10 coincide but n=15 is expected to differ), casting strong doubt on the claim of periodicity.
- Outlined concrete next steps to either complete a proof of nonperiodicity or to isolate precise (rare) coincidences like n=5,10.
