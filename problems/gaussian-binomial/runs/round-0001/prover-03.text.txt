Ideas and scope
- Clarify well-posedness: f_n was defined via v with q=v^2. One must justify that f_n depends only on q (not on the choice of v). I give a short lemma below.
- Test the claim with small N. For N=1 and N=2 we can compute f_n(ζ_N) in closed form and show it is not periodic. This already falsifies the claim as stated.
- Give explicit computations for N=3 to show no small small-period pattern, and explain why the “2N” heuristic is misleading.
- Suggest concrete corrections/alternatives and next steps.

Well-posedness: independence from the choice of v
Lemma. For all integers a,b with 0≤b≤a,
\[\qbinom{a}{b}_{-v}=(-1)^{b(a-b)}\qbinom{a}{b}_v.\]
In particular, when b is even (as in our sum b=2i), \(\qbinom{a}{b}_v\) is invariant under v↦−v, hence depends only on q=v^2.
Proof. Each factor [m]_v transforms by [m]_{-v}=(-1)^{m-1}[m]_v. The product over the numerator contributes exponent ∑_{m=a-b+1}^a (m−1)=b(a−(b+1)/2). The denominator contributes ∑_{m=1}^b (m−1)=b(b−1)/2. The difference is b(a−b), giving the displayed factor.

Immediate counterexamples to periodicity
1) N=1 (q=1). Then \(\qbinom{n+i}{2i}_q\) is the ordinary binomial \(\binom{n+i}{2i}\). A classical identity gives
\[ f_n(1)=\sum_{i=0}^n \binom{n+i}{2i}=F_{2n+1}, \]
where \(F_k\) are Fibonacci numbers. A short generating-function proof: for |x| small,
\[\sum_{n\ge 0} f_n(1)x^n=\sum_{i\ge 0} x^i\sum_{m\ge 0}\binom{m+2i}{2i}x^m=\sum_{i\ge 0}\frac{x^i}{(1-x)^{2i+1}}=\frac{1-x}{1-3x+x^2}.\]
The right-hand side equals \(\sum_{n\ge 0}F_{2n+1}x^n\). Since \(F_{2n+1}\) is unbounded and not periodic in n, the claim fails for N=1.

2) N=2 (q=−1). There is a well-known specialization (provable by the q-Pascal recurrence) for Gaussian binomials at q=−1:
\[ \qbinom{a}{b}_{-1}=\binom{\lfloor a/2\rfloor}{\lfloor b/2\rfloor}. \]
Hence
\[ f_n(-1)=\sum_{i=0}^n \binom{\lfloor (n+i)/2\rfloor}{i}. \]
Define \(s(n)=f_n(-1)\). A clean generating-function derivation (re-index s=n+i) gives
\[ \sum_{n\ge 0}s(n)x^n=\sum_{s\ge 0}x^s(1+x^{-1})^{\lfloor s/2\rfloor}=(1+x)\sum_{t\ge 0}[x(1+x)]^t=\frac{1+x}{1-x-x^2}. \]
Thus \(s(n)=F_{n+2}\). Again, Fibonacci numbers are not periodic, so the claim fails for N=2 as well.

Further evidence: N=3
Let q=ζ_3. From explicit polynomials we get
- f_0=1,
- f_1=2,
- f_2=3,
- f_3=3+ζ_3,
- f_4=3.
This already rules out periods 1,2,3. While this does not disprove period 6, it strongly suggests the stated “period dividing 2N” heuristic is not generally valid.

Diagnosis: why the “2N” heuristic is misleading
- It is true that at a 2N-th root v, quantum integers satisfy [m+N]_v=−[m]_v, which is 2N-periodicity up to sign. However, \(\qbinom{a}{b}_v\) is a symmetric Laurent polynomial in v and in fact a polynomial in q=v^2. The sign flips and index shifts in the [·]_v factors cancel in complicated ways across numerator/denominator, and there is no reason for \(\qbinom{n+i}{2i}_q\) (as a q-polynomial) to inherit simple periodicity in n after fixing q=ζ_N.
- If one tries a congruence approach “mod Φ_N(q)”, q-Lucas type factorizations control \(\qbinom{a}{b}_q\) in terms of base-N digits of a and b. In our sum, a=n+i and b=2i vary together with carries, so there is no uniform period in n modulo Φ_N.

Actionable corrections and suggestions
- The present claim is false. It should be removed or substantially revised. At minimum: explicitly exclude N=1 and N=2, but even for N≥3 the statement appears doubtful; small computations give no evidence for period dividing 2N.
- If a periodicity statement is intended, clarify the domain and equivalence: is it polynomial congruence modulo a cyclotomic ideal, equality at primitive roots only, or something like divisibility by [N]_v? As shown above, none of these hold in the naive form.
- A meaningful and potentially true replacement might look like one of the following, which can be investigated rigorously:
  - Congruence patterns: determine f_{n+N}(q) modulo Φ_N(q) in terms of f_n(q) and a controlled correction (q-Lucas heuristics). This would not give periodicity but could yield a finite-state linear recursion in n with coefficients in the cyclotomic quotient.
  - Vanishing patterns: characterize (n,i) for which \(\qbinom{n+i}{2i}(ζ_N)=0\) (many vanishings occur when N divides certain linear forms of n,i). This may simplify f_n(ζ_N) structurally.
  - Asymptotic behavior: for fixed N≥3, study the growth of |f_n(ζ_N)|; exhibiting unbounded growth along a subsequence would preclude periodicity for all N, closing the question decisively.

Concrete next steps
- Document well-posedness (v→−v invariance) in the writeup.
- Insert the rigorous counterexamples for N=1 and N=2, with the short generating-function proofs above.
- For N=3, compute f_n(ζ_3) for n up to, say, 12 to test period 6; this is a quick check and likely falsifies “period divides 2N” even for N=3.
- If a weaker, correct statement is desired, formulate it precisely (e.g., q-Lucas congruence patterns of the summands and their implications for f_n modulo Φ_N) and test on small N.

Summary
- The current claim (periodicity of a_N(n)=f_n(ζ_N) with period dividing 2N) is false: N=1 gives a_1(n)=F_{2n+1}, N=2 gives a_2(n)=F_{n+2}, neither periodic. The writeup should be corrected accordingly. I provided a lemma ensuring f_n is well-defined as a function of q, and short, rigorous proofs of the N=1 and N=2 counterexamples via generating functions. I outlined why the “2N” heuristic fails and suggested concrete, testable directions if one wants to salvage a related (but weaker) statement.
