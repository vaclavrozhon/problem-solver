This round fixes the interpretation (fixed N, q=ζ_N) and disproves the claimed periodicity. Key reductions: convert symmetrized q-binomials to standard ones (factor q^{i(i−n)}), derive the n-OGF ∑_n f_n(q)t^n = ∑_{i≥0} t^i/∏_{s=−i}^i(1−t q^s), and group indices via n=xN+s, i=yN+r. Applying q–Lucas at q=ζ_N factors each summand; summing over y gives diagonal binomial sums equal to Fibonacci numbers (S_0(x)=F_{2x+1}, S_1(x)=F_{2x}). Hence each residue subsequence g_s(x)=a_N(xN+s) is a linear combination of Fibonacci terms and satisfies the linear recurrence g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)−g_s(x). Therefore g_s cannot be periodic unless identically zero. Explicit counterexamples: N=1 yields a_1(n)=F_{2n+1}, N=2 yields a_2(n)=F_{n+2}; both unbounded.
