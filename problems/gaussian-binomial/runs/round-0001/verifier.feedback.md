Scope and correctness: The task (fixed N, evaluate a_N(n)=f_n(ζ_N)) is now correctly interpreted. The Current Output gives a valid strategy (reduce v-Gaussians to standard Gaussians and specialize at roots of unity) and provides a counterexample for N=2. However, there is a numerical error: a_2(7) should be 34 (not 40). Fortunately, the monotonicity argument on odd indices already suffices to disprove periodicity, so the incorrect numeral is nonessential.

Prover 1: Strong, relevant, and largely rigorous. The reduction f_n(q)=∑ q^{i(i−n)} [n+i;2i]_q is correct. The q-Lucas specialization at q=ζ_N is correctly applied, and the residue-class decomposition with y≥0 tails is sound (the tails terminate because binomials with 2y+δ>x+y+c vanish). The Fibonacci diagonal-sum identities are correct and easy to justify via Pascal recurrences. The conclusion that each subsequence n≡s (mod N) satisfies g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)−g_s(x) is correct; this immediately rules out period 2N. Note: this alone does not rule out arbitrary periods, but your explicit N=1 and N=2 counterexamples already refute the claim. Minor clarity: explicitly note why the case (δ=0,c=1) yields b_0>a_0 and hence vanishes.

Prover 2: Careful derivation, but addresses the different problem q=ζ_n (root order tied to n). That variant is interesting, yet orthogonal to the fixed-N claim. Please redirect these techniques (if desired) to analyze fixed N via grouping i by residues mod N.

Prover 3: The v→−v invariance lemma for even b is correct and useful. However, the claimed generating function yielding f_n(−1)=F_{n+2} is incorrect (e.g., f_2(−1)=1≠F_4). This stems from omitting the q-power twist q^{i(i−n)} at q=−1 (which is not always 1). Please correct this.

Files: I propose to replace output.md with a clean, self-contained counterexample for N=2 using an explicit evaluation of Gaussian binomials at q=−1 via the q-Pascal recurrence (included). proofs.md adds the evaluation lemma and the N=2 nonperiodicity proof. notes.md records the residue-class/Fibonacci decomposition for general N and next steps.

Next steps: (i) Fully write and verify the general q-Lucas-at-root-of-unity lemma and the residue-class decomposition for arbitrary N, then record the resulting second-order recurrence for each residue class. (ii) Compute explicit coefficients A_s,B_s,C_s for small N (e.g., N=3,4,5) to illustrate nonperiodicity and possible growth. (iii) Optional: explore periodicity modulo primes (Pisano-type facts) using the constant-coefficient recurrence for g_s.
