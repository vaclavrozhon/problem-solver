The Current Output gives a valid strategy (reduce v-Gaussians to standard Gaussians and specialize at roots of unity) and provides a counterexample for N=2. However, there is a numerical error: a_2(7) should be 34 (not 40). Fortunately, the monotonicity argument on odd indices already suffices to disprove periodicity, so the incorrect numeral is nonessential.\n\nProver 1: Strong, relevant, and largely rigorous. The reduction f_n(q)=\u2211 q^{i(i\u2212n)} [n+i;2i]_q is correct. The q-Lucas specialization at q=\u03b6_N is correctly applied, and the residue-class decomposition with y\u22650 tails is sound (the tails terminate because binomials with 2y+\u03b4>x+y+c vanish). The Fibonacci diagonal-sum identities are correct and easy to justify via Pascal recurrences. The conclusion that each subsequence n\u2261s (mod N) satisfies g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)\u2212g_s(x) is correct; this immediately rules out period 2N. Note: this alone does not rule out arbitrary periods, but your explicit N=1 and N=2 counterexamples already refute the claim. Minor clarity: explicitly note why the case (\u03b4=0,c=1) yields b_0>a_0 and hence vanishes.\n\nProver 2: Careful derivation, but addresses the different problem q=\u03b6_n (root order tied to n). That variant is interesting, yet orthogonal to the fixed-N claim. Please redirect these techniques (if desired) to analyze fixed N via grouping i by residues mod N.\n\nProver 3: The v\u2192\u2212v invariance lemma for even b is correct and useful. However, the claimed generating function yielding f_n(\u22121)=F_{n+2} is incorrect (e.g., f_2(\u22121)=1\u2260F_4). This stems from omitting the q-power twist q^{i(i\u2212n)} at q=\u22121 (which is not always 1). Please correct this.\n\nFiles: I propose to replace output.md with a clean, self-contained counterexample for N=2 using an explicit evaluation of Gaussian binomials at q=\u22121 via the q-Pascal recurrence (included). proofs.md adds the evaluation lemma and the N=2 nonperiodicity proof. notes.md records the residue-class/Fibonacci decomposition for general N and next steps.\n\nNext steps: (i) Fully write and verify the general q-Lucas-at-root-of-unity lemma and the residue-class decomposition for arbitrary N, then record the resulting second-order recurrence for each residue class. (ii) Compute explicit coefficients A_s,B_s,C_s for small N (e.g., N=3,4,5) to illustrate nonperiodicity and possible growth. (iii) Optional: explore periodicity modulo primes (Pisano-type facts) using the constant-coefficient recurrence for g_s.\n",

Prover 1 provided a solid, general decomposition at fixed N using q-Lucas and Fibonacci diagonal sums, proving each residue-class subsequence satisfies g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)\u2212g_s(x), which rules out period 2N.

We prove by induction on n that H(n,k)|_{q=\u22121}=L(n,k) for all k.\nBase n=0 is trivial. Assume the claim for n\u22121.

Therefore the odd subsequence a_2(2t+1) is strictly increasing: for example, a_2(3)=5 and a_2(5)=13. A sequence with a strictly increasing subsequence cannot be periodic.
