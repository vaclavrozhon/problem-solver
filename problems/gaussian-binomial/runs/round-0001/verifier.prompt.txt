=== SYSTEM ===
You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md, proofs.md, and output.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers
- notes.md (informal progress & exploratory work so far)
- proofs.md (rigorous proofs & detailed mathematics so far)
- output.md (main results found so far)

**Three-tier file system guidelines**:
- **notes.md**: Readable, log of exploratory work, intuitions, failed attempts, ideas. Prefer appending. Replace only if old notes are clearly misleading. It should be self-contained: In particular, reading it should make sense without knowing the output of provers in past rounds. 

- **proofs.md**: Complete rigorous mathematical proofs with full details. Think twice before adding anything. Contains proven lemmas, theorems, and detailed derivations. Only add mathematically verified content here.
- **output.md**: This is the only file that the user is supposed to read in case your verdict is "promising". It has to be self-contained. It contains ONLY the main problem results, and a discussion why they are relevant. It is extremely selective. Think twice before promoting proofs from proofs.md to output.md. Only if the result marks clear progress on the problem, and only if the proof in proofs.md has been thoroughly vetted by provers and you, it can join output.md. Each result must be followed by a rigorous, self-contained proof that properly defines all objects of interest and is essentially publication-ready. 

Tasks:
1) Audit rigor: identify unjustified steps, false statements, missing lemmas; produce minimal counterexamples.
2) Triage value: separate genuine progress from noise.
3) Guide next steps: propose what provers should try next.

# Periodicity of $f_n(q)$ at a fixed root of unity — self-contained statement

Fix an integer $N\ge 1$. Let $v$ be a formal parameter and define

$$
[m]_v=\frac{v^{m}-v^{-m}}{v-v^{-1}},\qquad
\qbinom{a}{b}_v=\frac{[a]_v[a-1]_v\cdots[a-b+1]_v}{[b]_v[b-1]_v\cdots[1]_v},
$$

with the conventions $\qbinom{a}{0}_v=1$ and $\qbinom{a}{b}_v=0$ for $b<0$ or $b>a$. Set $q=v^{2}$ and, for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$, define

$$
f_n(q)=\sum_{i=0}^{n}\qbinom{n+i}{2i}_v .
$$

Let $\zeta_N=e^{2\pi i/N}$. Consider the sequence $a_N(n)=f_n(\zeta_N)$ for $n=0,1,2,\dots$.

**Claim.** The sequence $\{a_N(n)\}_{n\ge 0}$ is periodic in $n$ (for example, with period dividing $2N$).

# Research Notes



Problem: f_n(q)=\sum_{i=0}^n \qbinom{n+i}{2i} with [n]=(v^n−v^{−n})/(v−v^{−1}), q=v^2. Claim (original): the sequence (f_n(e^{2π i/n}))_n is periodic.

Clarifying the statement
- Two readings:
  (A) a(n)=f_n(ζ_n) with ζ_n=e^{2π i/n} (n varies with the root); this seems unlikely to be periodic.
  (B) Fix N and study a_N(n)=f_n(ζ_N); this plausibly is N-periodic.

Core identities
- Symmetrized vs standard Gaussian: for 0≤k≤n,
  \qbinom{n}{k}_{sym} = q^{−\frac{k(n−k)}2} \binom{n}{k}_q.
  Hence f_n(q)=\sum_{i=0}^n q^{i(i−n)}\,\binom{n+i}{2i}_q.
- n-OGF:
  \sum_{n≥0} f_n(q)t^n = \sum_{i≥0} \frac{t^i}{\prod_{s=−i}^{i}(1−t q^s)}.
- Half-sum at q=ζ_n:
  f_n(ζ_n)=2+\sum_{j=1}^{\lfloor n/2\rfloor} ζ_n^{−j(n−j)}\,\binom{n−j}{j}_q\big|_{q=ζ_n}.
  Derivation: apply q-Lucas with modulus n to (n+i,2i) and relabel j=n−i.

Computations and observations (reading A)
- Small n: f_2(ζ_2)=1, f_3(ζ_3)=1, f_4(ζ_4)=2, f_5(ζ_5)=2+ζ_5+ζ_5^4=2+2cos(2π/5), f_6(ζ_6)=2.
  Note: the minimal polynomial of 2+2cos(2π/5) is x^2−3x+1 (correction).
- These values already rule out very small periods, but do not yet rigorously disprove periodicity for (A).

Plausible corrected claim (reading B)
- Fix N and q=ζ_N. The OGF suggests \sum_{n≥0} f_n(q)t^n is rational with denominator a power of 1−t^N. If the global denominator reduces to 1−t^N, then n↦f_n(ζ_N) is exactly N-periodic.

Caveats
- The symmetrized q-Pascal recursion involves q^{1/2}; to avoid branch ambiguities at roots of unity, either work in v with q=v^2 (integer exponents) or use the standard q-Pascal identity and convert via the exact factor q^{−k(n−k)/2}.

Next steps
1) Disproving (A): Evaluate f_p(ζ_p) for p=7,11 via the half-sum to see whether values are pairwise distinct across infinitely many primes; aim to certify distinct minimal polynomials.
2) Proving (B): Group the OGF sum over i≡r (mod N) and show each grouped sum has denominator exactly 1−t^N (use ∏_{r=0}^{N−1}(1−t q^r)=1−t^N and telescoping across m). This would yield exact N-periodicity. Alternatively, derive a constant-coefficient linear recurrence for f_n(ζ_N).

Problem clarification and plan (fixed N)
- Task: Fix N and study a_N(n) = f_n(ζ_N) as n varies. Earlier rounds mistakenly analyzed the different problem q = e^{2π i/n} (root order tied to n). The correct setting is now fixed.

Core identities to use
- Symmetric–standard relation: [N;K]_sym(v) = v^{-K(N−K)} [N;K]_q with q=v^2. For our K=2i, K(N−K) is even, so a_N(n) is independent of the sign choice v↦−v for the fixed square root of q.
- q–Lucas at a primitive m-th root (standard Gaussian): Writing X = am + b, Y = cm + d with 0≤b,d<m, we have [X;Y]_q|_{q=ζ_m} = binom(a,c)·[b;d]_q|_{q=ζ_m}.

Immediate consequence: disproof for N=2
- Take q=ζ_2=−1, v^2=q (v=i). By q–Lucas with m=2,
  [n choose k]_{-1} = 0 if n even and k odd; else = binom(⌊n/2⌋, ⌊k/2⌋).
- Thus for odd n=2t+1, the phase v^{-2i(n−i)} = (−1)^{i(n−i)} = 1 for all i, and
  f_n(−1) = ∑_{i=0}^{2t+1} binom(t + ⌊(i+1)/2⌋, i), which is strictly increasing in t (each summand with i≥1 increases when t increases). Numerically: f_3(−1)=5, f_7(−1)=40. Hence the sequence is not periodic; the claimed period ≤ 2N = 4 is contradicted at n=3 vs 7.

Next steps
- Generalize the nonperiodicity argument for other fixed N using q–Lucas with base N. In particular, analyze the subsequence n=tN and the contributions from i multiples of N.
- Cleanly separate notes for the matched-order regime (q=e^{2π i/n}) as a distinct problem variant; do not mix it with the fixed-N analysis.

# Main Results



Counterexample to the periodicity claim (fixed root of unity)

Definitions. For v a formal parameter, set [m]_v=(v^m−v^{−m})/(v−v^{−1}) and
  [A;B]_v = [A]_v [A−1]_v ··· [A−B+1]_v / ([B]_v [B−1]_v ··· [1]_v),
with the usual conventions. Let q=v^2, and define f_n(q)=∑_{i=0}^n [n+i; 2i]_v. For fixed N≥1, let ζ_N=e^{2π i/N} and a_N(n)=f_n(ζ_N).

Main result. The sequence {a_N(n)} need not be periodic. In fact, for N=2 (q=−1), the sequence is not periodic; hence the general periodicity claim (e.g., with period dividing 2N) is false.

Proof. First, relate symmetric and standard Gaussian coefficients: for all N,K,
  [N;K]_v = v^{−K(N−K)} [N;K]_{q} with q=v^2.
Take q=−1 (N=2) and choose v with v^2=−1 (e.g., v=i). Then
  [n+i; 2i]_v = v^{−2i(n−i)} [n+i; 2i]_{−1}.
At q=−1, a special case of q–Lucas (base 2) gives
  [n; k]_{−1} = 0 if n is even and k is odd; otherwise [n; k]_{−1} = binom(⌊n/2⌋, ⌊k/2⌋).
For odd n=2t+1 the phase v^{−2i(n−i)}=(−1)^{i(n−i)} equals 1 for all i, so
  a_2(2t+1) = ∑_{i=0}^{2t+1} binom(t+⌊(i+1)/2⌋, i).
Each summand with i≥1 strictly increases as t increases, hence the odd subsequence a_2(2t+1) is strictly increasing. Concretely, a_2(3)=5 and a_2(7)=40, so no period (in particular none dividing 2N=4) can exist. This disproves the periodicity claim. ∎

Remark. The above also shows that a_N(n) is well-defined (independent of the choice of square root v) in this problem, because K=2i makes K(N−K) even in the conversion formula.

Ideas
- Reduce v-Gaussians to q-Gaussians with q=v^2, then specialize q to a root of unity. This isolates a simple q-power factor.
- Use the q-Lucas theorem at q=ζ_N to split Gaussian binomials along base-N digits. This organizes the i-sum by residue classes modulo N.
- Sum the arising ordinary binomial tails; these are classical Fibonacci sums. This yields an explicit formula for the subsequences n≡s (mod N), proving they satisfy a fixed second-order linear recurrence in the step x along the arithmetic progression.
- Conclude: no nontrivial periodicity in n can hold; indeed even the N-step subsequences are non-periodic. Provide counterexamples and a rigorous obstruction via the recurrence.

Key algebraic reduction
For integers a≥b≥0,
- [m]_v = (v^m−v^{−m})/(v−v^{−1}) = v^{1−m}(1−q^m)/(1−q), with q=v^2.
- Hence
  \[\qbinom{a}{b}_v = v^{\sum_{j=0}^{b-1}(1-(a-j)) - \sum_{j=0}^{b-1}(1-(b-j))}\prod_{j=0}^{b-1}\frac{1-q^{a-j}}{1-q^{b-j}} = v^{b(b-a)}\qbinom{a}{b}_q.\]
In particular, for a=n+i, b=2i we get
  \[\qbinom{n+i}{2i}_v = q^{i(i-n)}\qbinom{n+i}{2i}_q.\]
Thus
  \[f_n(q)=\sum_{i=0}^n q^{i(i-n)}\qbinom{n+i}{2i}_q.\]

q-Lucas at a primitive N-th root
Let q=ζ_N and write a=a_1N+a_0, b=b_1N+b_0 with 0≤a_0,b_0<N. Then the q-Lucas theorem (specialized to evaluation at ζ_N) gives
  \[\qbinom{a}{b}_{ζ_N} = \binom{a_1}{b_1}\,\qbinom{a_0}{b_0}_{ζ_N}\]
(with convention 0 if b_0>a_0). Sketch: write q-factorials via (q;q)_m=∏_{j=1}^m(1−q^j), group terms into N-blocks, note cancellations of factors 1−q^{jN}=0 occur in matching numbers in numerator/denominator, leaving the ordinary binomial from block-count and the residue Gaussian from the remainders.

Fibonacci diagonal sums
Define for x≥0 and δ,c∈{0,1}
  S_{δ,c}(x)=\sum_{y≥0}\binom{x+y+c}{2y+δ}.
A standard induction using Pascal’s identity yields
  - S_{0,0}(x)=F_{2x+1},
  - S_{1,0}(x)=F_{2x},
  - S_{1,1}(x)=F_{2x+2},
  - S_{0,1}(x)=F_{2x+3},
where F_m is the Fibonacci sequence (F_0=0,F_1=1). Proof outline: set S_0(x)=∑\binom{x+y}{2y}, S_1(x)=∑\binom{x+y}{2y+1}. Pascal gives S_0(x+1)=S_0(x)+S_1(x) and S_1(x+1)=S_1(x)+S_0(x), with S_0(0)=1,S_1(0)=0; hence S_0(x)=F_{2x+1}, S_1(x)=F_{2x}. The c=1 cases follow by another Pascal step.

Residue-class decomposition
Fix N, write n=xN+s with 0≤s<N. For i=yN+r with 0≤r<N, set δ=⌊2r/N⌋∈{0,1}, c=⌊(s+r)/N⌋∈{0,1}, a_0=s+r−cN, b_0=2r−δN. Then at q=ζ_N,
- the q-power factor is ζ_N^{r(r−s)} (depends only on residues),
- q-Lucas gives \qbinom{n+i}{2i}_{ζ_N} = \binom{x+y+c}{2y+δ}\,\qbinom{a_0}{b_0}_{ζ_N}.
Therefore
  f_{xN+s}(ζ_N)=\sum_{r=0}^{N-1} ζ_N^{r(r-s)}\,\qbinom{a_0}{b_0}_{ζ_N}\,\sum_{y≥0}\binom{x+y+c}{2y+δ}.
By the Fibonacci sums,
  \[f_{xN+s}(ζ_N)=\sum_{r=0}^{N-1} ζ_N^{r(r-s)}\,\qbinom{a_0}{b_0}_{ζ_N}\,F_{2x+2c+1-δ}.\]
Equivalently, there exist constants (depending only on s,N)
  A_s=\sum_{r:δ=1} ζ_N^{r(r-s)}\,\qbinom{a_0}{b_0}_{ζ_N},
  B_s=\sum_{r:δ=0} ζ_N^{r(r-s)}\,\qbinom{a_0}{b_0}_{ζ_N},
  C_s=\sum_{r:δ=1,c=1} ζ_N^{r(r-s)}\,\qbinom{a_0}{b_0}_{ζ_N}
(since the case δ=0,c=1 contributes 0), such that
  \[g_s(x):=f_{xN+s}(ζ_N)=A_sF_{2x}+B_sF_{2x+1}+C_sF_{2x+2}.\]
In particular, for every s the arithmetic-progression subsequence n≡s (mod N) satisfies the fixed linear recurrence
  g_s(x+2)=3\,g_s(x+1)−g_s(x) for all x≥0.
This follows from F_{n+4}=3F_{n+2}−F_n and linearity.

Immediate obstruction to periodicity
- If a_N(n) had period dividing 2N in n, then for each residue s the subsequence g_s(x)=a_N(xN+s) would have period dividing 2 in x, i.e. g_s(x+2)=g_s(x) for all x.
- Combining with the proven recurrence g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)−g_s(x) yields 0=(g_s(x+2)−g_s(x))=3g_s(x+1)−2g_s(x) for all x, hence also 0=3g_s(x)−2g_s(x−1), and so on; solving forces g_s(x)≡0. But g_s is not identically 0 (e.g., g_0(0)=f_0(ζ_N)=1). Contradiction.
Therefore the claimed periodicity fails for every N≥1.

Concrete counterexamples
- N=1 (q=1): f_n(1)=∑_{i=0}^n \binom{n+i}{2i}=F_{2n+1} (classical), not periodic.
- N=2 (q=−1): from the decomposition, f_{2x}(−1)=F_{2x+1}−F_{2x}=F_{2x−1}, f_{2x+1}(−1)=F_{2x+3}, again not periodic.

Remarks and checks
- The single residue r=0 already contributes F_{2x+1} to g_s(x) (since ζ_N^{0}=1 and \qbinom{s}{0}_{ζ_N}=1), which by itself varies with x. The full decomposition refines this and proves the recurrence rigorously.
- The coefficients A_s,B_s,C_s lie in the cyclotomic field Q(ζ_N). The recurrence has characteristic polynomial λ^2−3λ+1, whose roots (3±√5)/2 are not on the unit circle; thus no nonzero solution is periodic.

Obstacles
- A direct n-recursion for f_n(q) at generic q seems more delicate; the residue-class method cleanly separates the arithmetic progression structure using q-Lucas.

Next steps
- Record the explicit decomposition and recurrence as main results; this is auditable and useful.
- If a modified claim is desired, one can seek periodicity modulo a prime p (Pisano-type phenomena), since g_s satisfies a fixed linear recurrence over Z[ζ_N]; modulo p the sequence is eventually periodic.
- Compute A_s,B_s,C_s explicitly for small N to illustrate the formula and to give exact closed forms for f_{xN+s}(ζ_N).

Ideas
- Evaluate each summand at a primitive n-th root of unity via q-Lucas at roots of unity and a trigonometric factorization. This yields an explicit, real-valued alternating sum in terms of sine products. This reduces the problem to a tractable, checkable formula and allows computation of many values to test periodicity.
- Use the “symmetrized” vs “standard” Gaussian relation to track the exact q-power twist that appears at specialization q = e^{2π i/n}.
- Derive a clean recursion for the sine-product weights to expedite exact or high-precision computations and to look for cancellations.

Key relations and a main evaluation lemma
Let [n] = (v^n - v^{-n})/(v - v^{-1}), q = v^2, and set
G_{n,k}(q) = standard Gaussian binomial [n \choose k]_q = ∏_{a=1}^k \frac{1 - q^{n-k+a}}{1 - q^a}.
The symmetrized Gaussian satisfies the exact relation (straightforward from [t] = v^{-(t-1)}(1-q^t)/(1-q)):
(1)  [n \choose k]_{sym}(q) = v^{-k(n-k)} G_{n,k}(q) = q^{-\frac{k(n-k)}{2}} G_{n,k}(q).
Fix n ≥ 1 and put q = ζ_n = e^{2π i / n}. For 0 ≤ i ≤ n define N = n + i and K = 2i. By the q-Lucas theorem at roots of unity (Sved, 1988; also follows by grouping the (1 - q^t) factors by residues mod n), writing N = A n + r, K = B n + s with 0 ≤ r,s < n, we have
(2)  G_{N,K}(ζ_n) = \binom{A}{B} G_{r,s}(ζ_n).
In our case: for 0 ≤ i < n we have A = 1, r = i, and B = ⌊2i/n⌋; for i = n we have A = 2, r = 0 and B = 2, s = 0.
Consequently
(3)  [n+i \choose 2i]_{sym}(ζ_n) = ζ_n^{-i(n-i)} · \binom{A}{B} · G_{r,s}(ζ_n).
Now recall the well-known trigonometric evaluation (for 0 ≤ j ≤ i < n):
(4)  G_{i,j}(ζ_n) = e^{\frac{\pi i}{n} j(i-j)} · \prod_{a=1}^j \frac{\sin(\pi (i-j+a)/n)}{\sin(\pi a/n)}.
Combining (3)–(4) with j = 2i - n (for the nonzero range ⌈n/2⌉ ≤ i ≤ n-1) and simplifying the total phase gives a complete cancellation of all nontrivial phases:
-2 i(n-i) + j(i-j) = n(i-n), hence the total unit-factor is e^{\pi i (i-n)} = (-1)^{i+n}.
Thus we obtain the following explicit, real evaluation.

Proposition (explicit evaluation at roots of unity). For q = ζ_n = e^{2π i/n},
- [n+i \choose 2i]_{sym}(ζ_n) = 0 for 1 ≤ i < n/2.
- [n \choose 0]_{sym}(ζ_n) = [2n \choose 2n]_{sym}(ζ_n) = 1.
- For ⌈n/2⌉ ≤ i ≤ n-1,
  [n+i \choose 2i]_{sym}(ζ_n) = (-1)^{i+n} · R(i,n),
  where
  R(i,n) = \prod_{a=1}^{2i-n} \frac{\sin(\pi (n-i+a)/n)}{\sin(\pi a/n)} = \prod_{r=n-i+1}^{i} \frac{\sin(\pi r/n)}{\sin(\pi (r-(n-i))/n)} > 0.
In particular,
(5)  f_n(ζ_n) = 2 + \sum_{i=\lceil n/2\rceil}^{n-1} (-1)^{i+n} R(i,n).
Corollary. For every n ≥ 1, f_n(e^{2π i/n}) ∈ ℝ.
Proof. Immediate from (5) since each R(i,n) > 0 and each summand equals ±R(i,n).

A useful recursion for the weights R(i,n)
Write n = 2m or n = 2m+1 and set j_i = 2i - n. Then one can compute R(i+1,n)/R(i,n) by direct cancellation:
- If n = 2m and i = m + s (so j_i = 2s), then
  (6)  R(i+1,n)/R(i,n) = \frac{\sin\big(\frac{\pi}{2m}(m-s)\big) · \sin\big(\frac{\pi}{2m}(m+s+1)\big)}{\sin\big(\frac{\pi}{2m}(2s+1)\big) · \sin\big(\frac{\pi}{2m}(2s+2)\big)}.
- An analogous formula holds for n odd (with the same derivation using telescoping of adjacent numerator/denominator factors).
This recursion is convenient for exact computation and for spotting cancellations in pairs (e.g., when the numerator sines match the denominator sines by complementary-angle identities).

Examples (checked from (5) and (6))
- n=1: f_1(1)=2.
- n=2: f_2(-1)=1.
- n=3: f_3(e^{2π i/3})=1.
- n=4: f_4(i)=2.
- n=5: f_5(e^{2π i/5}) = 2 + (−1)^{8}R(3,5) + (−1)^{9}R(4,5) = 2 + R(3,5) − R(4,5) = 1 + φ = 1 + 2 cos(π/5) = (3+\sqrt5)/2.
  Here R(3,5)=sin(2π/5)/sin(π/5)=2 cos(π/5)=φ, and R(4,5)=1.
- n=6: f_6(e^{2π i/6}) = 2 (since the contributions from i=3,4,5 are −1,+2,−1).
- n=7: f_7(e^{2π i/7}) = 1 (numerical check via (5): the three terms cancel to −1).
- n=8: f_8(e^{2π i/8}) = 1 (the four terms sum to −1).
- n=9: f_9(e^{2π i/9}) ≈ 1.344557... (from R(5,9)≈2.879385, R(6,9)≈4.414214, R(7,9)≈1.879385, R(8,9)=1).
- n=10: f_{10}(e^{2π i/10}) = 1 + φ again (here R(6,10)=R(7,10) cancel, and the leftover gives φ^2 − 2, hence total 2 + (φ^2 − 2) = 1 + φ).
These serve as independent confirmations of (5) and show substantial variation with n.

Obstacles to periodicity
- The explicit formula (5) depends on the collection of sines at fractions with denominator n. As n varies, these collections and their paired cancellations change in a highly nonperiodic way. Already: f_3=1, f_6=2, f_9≈1.3446, so the values along multiples of 3 are not periodic; likewise f_4=2, f_8=1.
- Even though some coincidences occur (e.g., f_5=f_{10}=(3+\sqrt5)/2), computations via (5) indicate that f_n(e^{2π i/n}) takes infinitely many distinct values as n varies (e.g., n=5,9,10 already yield three different values).
- A fully rigorous disproof of global periodicity would follow if one can show that f_{n}(ζ_n) assumes infinitely many distinct values on an arithmetic progression n ≡ a (mod T) for any fixed T. The formula (6) suggests a path: along such a progression one controls the ratios R(i+1,n)/R(i,n) via complementary-angle identities, and one can exhibit indices i where a fixed pairwise-cancellation pattern fails, forcing distinct totals.

Next steps (concrete, testable)
1) Formalize a rigorous proof of (2) in our setting (q-Lucas at primitive n-th roots), and of the trigonometric evaluation (4). These are standard but should be recorded for completeness in proofs.md.
2) Use (5) to compute f_n(e^{2π i/n}) exactly (symbolically) for n up to, say, 30, to search for small periods; current data (n=1..10) already disqualify small periods like 2,3,4,6.
3) Attempt a nonperiodicity proof: fix an arbitrary T and analyze the subsequence n ≡ 0 (mod T·5). Using (6), show that for the three indices near the top range, the signed contributions depend on cos(π/n) and cos(2π/n), which vary injectively with n, hence the total cannot be constant on that progression.
4) Special families: For n=2^k the sum in (5) alternates and seems to take only the values 1 or 2 for small k; prove or refute this pattern using (6).

Summary of progress
- Derived and proved an explicit evaluation formula (5): f_n(e^{2π i/n}) is a purely real, alternating sum of positive sine-product weights R(i,n). This reduces the problem to classical trigonometry.
- Provided a clean recursion (6) for these weights, enabling fast exact computations and analytical comparison across successive terms.
- Computed f_n for several n; the resulting values show evident nonperiodic behavior (e.g., n=3,6,9 differ; n=4,8 differ; n=5,10 coincide but n=15 is expected to differ), casting strong doubt on the claim of periodicity.
- Outlined concrete next steps to either complete a proof of nonperiodicity or to isolate precise (rare) coincidences like n=5,10.

Ideas and scope
- Clarify well-posedness: f_n was defined via v with q=v^2. One must justify that f_n depends only on q (not on the choice of v). I give a short lemma below.
- Test the claim with small N. For N=1 and N=2 we can compute f_n(ζ_N) in closed form and show it is not periodic. This already falsifies the claim as stated.
- Give explicit computations for N=3 to show no small small-period pattern, and explain why the “2N” heuristic is misleading.
- Suggest concrete corrections/alternatives and next steps.

Well-posedness: independence from the choice of v

\[\qbinom{a}{b}_{-v}=(-1)^{b(a-b)}\qbinom{a}{b}_v.\]
In particular, when b is even (as in our sum b=2i), \(\qbinom{a}{b}_v\) is invariant under v↦−v, hence depends only on q=v^2.
Proof. Each factor [m]_v transforms by [m]_{-v}=(-1)^{m-1}[m]_v. The product over the numerator contributes exponent ∑_{m=a-b+1}^a (m−1)=b(a−(b+1)/2). The denominator contributes ∑_{m=1}^b (m−1)=b(b−1)/2. The difference is b(a−b), giving the displayed factor.

Immediate counterexamples to periodicity
1) N=1 (q=1). Then \(\qbinom{n+i}{2i}_q\) is the ordinary binomial \(\binom{n+i}{2i}\). A classical identity gives
\[ f_n(1)=\sum_{i=0}^n \binom{n+i}{2i}=F_{2n+1}, \]
where \(F_k\) are Fibonacci numbers. A short generating-function proof: for |x| small,
\[\sum_{n\ge 0} f_n(1)x^n=\sum_{i\ge 0} x^i\sum_{m\ge 0}\binom{m+2i}{2i}x^m=\sum_{i\ge 0}\frac{x^i}{(1-x)^{2i+1}}=\frac{1-x}{1-3x+x^2}.\]
The right-hand side equals \(\sum_{n\ge 0}F_{2n+1}x^n\). Since \(F_{2n+1}\) is unbounded and not periodic in n, the claim fails for N=1.

2) N=2 (q=−1). There is a well-known specialization (provable by the q-Pascal recurrence) for Gaussian binomials at q=−1:
\[ \qbinom{a}{b}_{-1}=\binom{\lfloor a/2\rfloor}{\lfloor b/2\rfloor}. \]
Hence
\[ f_n(-1)=\sum_{i=0}^n \binom{\lfloor (n+i)/2\rfloor}{i}. \]
Define \(s(n)=f_n(-1)\). A clean generating-function derivation (re-index s=n+i) gives
\[ \sum_{n\ge 0}s(n)x^n=\sum_{s\ge 0}x^s(1+x^{-1})^{\lfloor s/2\rfloor}=(1+x)\sum_{t\ge 0}[x(1+x)]^t=\frac{1+x}{1-x-x^2}. \]
Thus \(s(n)=F_{n+2}\). Again, Fibonacci numbers are not periodic, so the claim fails for N=2 as well.

Further evidence: N=3
Let q=ζ_3. From explicit polynomials we get
- f_0=1,
- f_1=2,
- f_2=3,
- f_3=3+ζ_3,
- f_4=3.
This already rules out periods 1,2,3. While this does not disprove period 6, it strongly suggests the stated “period dividing 2N” heuristic is not generally valid.

Diagnosis: why the “2N” heuristic is misleading
- It is true that at a 2N-th root v, quantum integers satisfy [m+N]_v=−[m]_v, which is 2N-periodicity up to sign. However, \(\qbinom{a}{b}_v\) is a symmetric Laurent polynomial in v and in fact a polynomial in q=v^2. The sign flips and index shifts in the [·]_v factors cancel in complicated ways across numerator/denominator, and there is no reason for \(\qbinom{n+i}{2i}_q\) (as a q-polynomial) to inherit simple periodicity in n after fixing q=ζ_N.
- If one tries a congruence approach “mod Φ_N(q)”, q-Lucas type factorizations control \(\qbinom{a}{b}_q\) in terms of base-N digits of a and b. In our sum, a=n+i and b=2i vary together with carries, so there is no uniform period in n modulo Φ_N.

Actionable corrections and suggestions
- The present claim is false. It should be removed or substantially revised. At minimum: explicitly exclude N=1 and N=2, but even for N≥3 the statement appears doubtful; small computations give no evidence for period dividing 2N.
- If a periodicity statement is intended, clarify the domain and equivalence: is it polynomial congruence modulo a cyclotomic ideal, equality at primitive roots only, or something like divisibility by [N]_v? As shown above, none of these hold in the naive form.
- A meaningful and potentially true replacement might look like one of the following, which can be investigated rigorously:
  - Congruence patterns: determine f_{n+N}(q) modulo Φ_N(q) in terms of f_n(q) and a controlled correction (q-Lucas heuristics). This would not give periodicity but could yield a finite-state linear recursion in n with coefficients in the cyclotomic quotient.
  - Vanishing patterns: characterize (n,i) for which \(\qbinom{n+i}{2i}(ζ_N)=0\) (many vanishings occur when N divides certain linear forms of n,i). This may simplify f_n(ζ_N) structurally.
  - Asymptotic behavior: for fixed N≥3, study the growth of |f_n(ζ_N)|; exhibiting unbounded growth along a subsequence would preclude periodicity for all N, closing the question decisively.

Concrete next steps
- Document well-posedness (v→−v invariance) in the writeup.
- Insert the rigorous counterexamples for N=1 and N=2, with the short generating-function proofs above.
- For N=3, compute f_n(ζ_3) for n up to, say, 12 to test period 6; this is a quick check and likely falsifies “period divides 2N” even for N=3.
- If a weaker, correct statement is desired, formulate it precisely (e.g., q-Lucas congruence patterns of the summands and their implications for f_n modulo Φ_N) and test on small N.

Summary
- The current claim (periodicity of a_N(n)=f_n(ζ_N) with period dividing 2N) is false: N=1 gives a_1(n)=F_{2n+1}, N=2 gives a_2(n)=F_{n+2}, neither periodic. The writeup should be corrected accordingly. I provided a lemma ensuring f_n is well-defined as a function of q, and short, rigorous proofs of the N=1 and N=2 counterexamples via generating functions. I outlined why the “2N” heuristic fails and suggested concrete, testable directions if one wants to salvage a related (but weaker) statement.
