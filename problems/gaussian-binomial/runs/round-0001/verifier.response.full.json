The sequence {a_N(n)} need not be periodic. In fact, for N=2 (q=\u22121) it is not periodic.\\n\\nProof. First, relate symmetric and standard Gaussian coefficients: for all a\u2265b\u22650 and q=v^2,\\n\\\\qbinom{a}{b}_v = v^{b(b\u2212a)}\\\\,\\\\binom{a}{b}_q.\\nThus\\nf_n(\u22121)=\\\\sum_{i=0}^n (\u22121)^{i(i\u2212n)}\\\\,\\\\binom{n+i}{2i}_{q}\\\\big|_{q=\u22121}.\\nWe evaluate the standard Gaussian at q=\u22121:\\n(\u2217) For all n,k with 0\u2264k\u2264n, \\\\binom{n}{k}_{q}\\\\big|_{q=\u22121}=0 if n is even and k is odd, and otherwise equals \\\\binom{\\\\lfloor n/2\\\\rfloor}{\\\\lfloor k/2\\\\rfloor}. This follows by induction from the q-Pascal recursion H(n,k)=H(n\u22121,k)+q^{n\u2212k}H(n\u22121,k\u22121), evaluating at q=\u22121 and splitting parities; the base cases H(n,0)=H(n,n)=1 are immediate.\\nFor odd n=2t+1 we have (\u22121)^{i(i\u2212n)}=(\u22121)^{i(i\u22121)}=1 for all i, and 2i is even, so by (\u2217)\\n\\\\binom{n+i}{2i}_{\u22121}=\\\\binom{\\\\lfloor (2t+1+i)/2\\\\rfloor}{i}=\\\\binom{t+\\\\lfloor (i+1)/2\\\\rfloor}{i}.\\nHence\\na_2(2t+1)=\\\\sum_{i=0}^{2t+1} \\\\binom{t+\\\\lfloor (i+1)/2\\\\rfloor}{i}.\\nFor each i\u22651, the summand is strictly increasing in t (it is \\\\binom{x}{i} with x=t+\\\\lfloor (i+1)/2\\\\rfloor). Therefore the odd subsequence a_2(2t+1) is strictly increasing: for example, a_2(3)=5 and a_2(5)=13. A sequence with a strictly increasing subsequence cannot be periodic. Thus {a_2(n)} is not periodic, and the claimed periodicity for general N is false. \u220e\\n\\nRemark. The identity (\u2217) also confirms well-posedness: since b=2i is even, \\\\qbinom{n+i}{2i}_v depends only on q=v^2 (not on the sign of v).\"}}",
