We corrected scope to fixed N and disproved the periodicity claim via N=2: the odd subsequence a_2(2t+1) is strictly increasing, hence {a_2(n)} is not periodic. We fixed a numeric error (a_2(7)=34, not 40). Prover 1 provided a solid, general decomposition at fixed N using q-Lucas and Fibonacci diagonal sums, proving each residue-class subsequence satisfies g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)−g_s(x), which rules out period 2N. Prover 2 analyzed a different variant (q=ζ_n), not applicable here. Prover 3’s v→−v invariance is correct; his claim f_n(−1)=F_{n+2} is incorrect. We update output.md with a self-contained N=2 counterexample and proofs.md with the evaluation lemma at q=−1 and the nonperiodicity proof. Verdict: promising.
