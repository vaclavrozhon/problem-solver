The reduction f_n(q)=∑ q^{i(i−n)} [n+i;2i]_q is correct. The q-Lucas specialization at q=ζ_N is correctly applied, and the residue-class decomposition with y≥0 tails is sound (the tails terminate because binomials with 2y+δ>x+y+c vanish). The Fibonacci diagonal-sum identities are correct and easy to justify via Pascal recurrences. The conclusion that each subsequence n≡s (mod N) satisfies g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)−g_s(x) is correct; this immediately rules out period 2N. Note: this alone does not rule out arbitrary periods, but your explicit N=1 and N=2 counterexamples already refute the claim. Minor clarity: explicitly note why the case (δ=0,c=1) yields b_0>a_0 and hence vanishes.\n\nProver 2: Careful derivation, but addresses the different problem q=ζ_n (root order tied to n).

However, the claimed generating function yielding f_n(−1)=F_{n+2} is incorrect (e.g., f_2(−1)=1≠F_4). This stems from omitting the q-power twist q^{i(i−n)} at q=−1 (which is not always 1).
