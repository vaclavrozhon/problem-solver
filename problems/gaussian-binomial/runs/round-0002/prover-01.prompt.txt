# Periodicity of $f_n(q)$ at a fixed root of unity — self-contained statement

Fix an integer $N\ge 1$. Let $v$ be a formal parameter and define

$$
[m]_v=\frac{v^{m}-v^{-m}}{v-v^{-1}},\qquad
\qbinom{a}{b}_v=\frac{[a]_v[a-1]_v\cdots[a-b+1]_v}{[b]_v[b-1]_v\cdots[1]_v},
$$

with the conventions $\qbinom{a}{0}_v=1$ and $\qbinom{a}{b}_v=0$ for $b<0$ or $b>a$. Set $q=v^{2}$ and, for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$, define

$$
f_n(q)=\sum_{i=0}^{n}\qbinom{n+i}{2i}_v .
$$

Let $\zeta_N=e^{2\pi i/N}$. Consider the sequence $a_N(n)=f_n(\zeta_N)$ for $n=0,1,2,\dots$.

**Claim.** The sequence $\{a_N(n)\}_{n\ge 0}$ is periodic in $n$ (for example, with period dividing $2N$).

Problem: f_n(q)=\sum_{i=0}^n \qbinom{n+i}{2i} with [n]=(v^n−v^{−n})/(v−v^{−1}), q=v^2. Claim (original): the sequence (f_n(e^{2π i/n}))_n is periodic.

Clarifying the statement
- Two readings:
  (A) a(n)=f_n(ζ_n) with ζ_n=e^{2π i/n} (n varies with the root); this seems unlikely to be periodic.
  (B) Fix N and study a_N(n)=f_n(ζ_N); this plausibly is N-periodic.

Core identities
- Symmetrized vs standard Gaussian: for 0≤k≤n,
  \qbinom{n}{k}_{sym} = q^{−\frac{k(n−k)}2} \binom{n}{k}_q.
  Hence f_n(q)=\sum_{i=0}^n q^{i(i−n)}\,\binom{n+i}{2i}_q.
- n-OGF:
  \sum_{n≥0} f_n(q)t^n = \sum_{i≥0} \frac{t^i}{\prod_{s=−i}^{i}(1−t q^s)}.
- Half-sum at q=ζ_n:
  f_n(ζ_n)=2+\sum_{j=1}^{\lfloor n/2\rfloor} ζ_n^{−j(n−j)}\,\binom{n−j}{j}_q\big|_{q=ζ_n}.
  Derivation: apply q-Lucas with modulus n to (n+i,2i) and relabel j=n−i.

Computations and observations (reading A)
- Small n: f_2(ζ_2)=1, f_3(ζ_3)=1, f_4(ζ_4)=2, f_5(ζ_5)=2+ζ_5+ζ_5^4=2+2cos(2π/5), f_6(ζ_6)=2.
  Note: the minimal polynomial of 2+2cos(2π/5) is x^2−3x+1 (correction).
- These values already rule out very small periods, but do not yet rigorously disprove periodicity for (A).

Plausible corrected claim (reading B)
- Fix N and q=ζ_N. The OGF suggests \sum_{n≥0} f_n(q)t^n is rational with denominator a power of 1−t^N. If the global denominator reduces to 1−t^N, then n↦f_n(ζ_N) is exactly N-periodic.

Caveats
- The symmetrized q-Pascal recursion involves q^{1/2}; to avoid branch ambiguities at roots of unity, either work in v with q=v^2 (integer exponents) or use the standard q-Pascal identity and convert via the exact factor q^{−k(n−k)/2}.

Next steps
1) Disproving (A): Evaluate f_p(ζ_p) for p=7,11 via the half-sum to see whether values are pairwise distinct across infinitely many primes; aim to certify distinct minimal polynomials.
2) Proving (B): Group the OGF sum over i≡r (mod N) and show each grouped sum has denominator exactly 1−t^N (use ∏_{r=0}^{N−1}(1−t q^r)=1−t^N and telescoping across m). This would yield exact N-periodicity. Alternatively, derive a constant-coefficient linear recurrence for f_n(ζ_N).

Problem clarification and plan (fixed N)
- Task: Fix N and study a_N(n) = f_n(ζ_N) as n varies. Earlier rounds mistakenly analyzed the different problem q = e^{2π i/n} (root order tied to n). The correct setting is now fixed.

Core identities to use
- Symmetric–standard relation: [N;K]_sym(v) = v^{-K(N−K)} [N;K]_q with q=v^2. For our K=2i, K(N−K) is even, so a_N(n) is independent of the sign choice v↦−v for the fixed square root of q.
- q–Lucas at a primitive m-th root (standard Gaussian): Writing X = am + b, Y = cm + d with 0≤b,d<m, we have [X;Y]_q|_{q=ζ_m} = binom(a,c)·[b;d]_q|_{q=ζ_m}.

Immediate consequence: disproof for N=2
- Take q=ζ_2=−1, v^2=q (v=i). By q–Lucas with m=2,
  [n choose k]_{-1} = 0 if n even and k odd; else = binom(⌊n/2⌋, ⌊k/2⌋).
- Thus for odd n=2t+1, the phase v^{-2i(n−i)} = (−1)^{i(n−i)} = 1 for all i, and
  f_n(−1) = ∑_{i=0}^{2t+1} binom(t + ⌊(i+1)/2⌋, i), which is strictly increasing in t (each summand with i≥1 increases when t increases). Numerically: f_3(−1)=5, f_7(−1)=40. Hence the sequence is not periodic; the claimed period ≤ 2N = 4 is contradicted at n=3 vs 7.

Next steps
- Generalize the nonperiodicity argument for other fixed N using q–Lucas with base N. In particular, analyze the subsequence n=tN and the contributions from i multiples of N.
- Cleanly separate notes for the matched-order regime (q=e^{2π i/n}) as a distinct problem variant; do not mix it with the fixed-N analysis.

Disproof of the periodicity claim.

Setup: f_n(q)=\sum_{i=0}^n \qbinom{n+i}{2i}_v with q=v^2 and b=2i even, so \qbinom{a}{b}_v depends only on q. We study a_N(n)=f_n(\zeta_N).

Quick counterexamples:
- N=1: a_1(n)=\sum_i \binom{n+i}{2i}=F_{2n+1}, not periodic.
- N=2 (q=−1): Using the specialization \binom{a}{b}_{−1}=0 if a even, b odd; otherwise \binom{\lfloor a/2\rfloor}{\lfloor b/2\rfloor}, one gets a_2(n)=\sum_{i=0}^n \binom{\lfloor (n+i)/2\rfloor}{i}=F_{n+2}, not periodic (indeed unbounded).

Stronger structure (from residue-class decomposition): For fixed N, writing n=xN+s, one can group i=yN+r and use q-Lucas at q=\zeta_N to factor each summand into a residue-dependent constant times an ordinary binomial \binom{x+y+c}{2y+\delta}. Summing over y yields Fibonacci numbers F_{2x+\cdot}. Consequently, for each residue s the subsequence g_s(x)=a_N(xN+s) satisfies g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)−g_s(x), hence cannot be periodic unless identically zero (and g_0(0)=1). This provides a general nonperiodicity mechanism for all N.

Next steps:
- Formalize the q-Lucas-at-\zeta_N step and write the full recurrence proof.
- Explore periodicity modulo primes (Pisano-type) or closed forms for the coefficients in the decomposition for small N.

# Main Results



Counterexample to the periodicity claim (fixed root of unity)

Definitions. For v a formal parameter, set [m]_v=(v^m−v^{−m})/(v−v^{−1}) and
  [A;B]_v = [A]_v [A−1]_v ··· [A−B+1]_v / ([B]_v [B−1]_v ··· [1]_v),
with the usual conventions. Let q=v^2, and define f_n(q)=∑_{i=0}^n [n+i; 2i]_v. For fixed N≥1, let ζ_N=e^{2π i/N} and a_N(n)=f_n(ζ_N).

Main result. The sequence {a_N(n)} need not be periodic. In fact, for N=2 (q=−1), the sequence is not periodic; hence the general periodicity claim (e.g., with period dividing 2N) is false.

Proof. First, relate symmetric and standard Gaussian coefficients: for all N,K,
  [N;K]_v = v^{−K(N−K)} [N;K]_{q} with q=v^2.
Take q=−1 (N=2) and choose v with v^2=−1 (e.g., v=i). Then
  [n+i; 2i]_v = v^{−2i(n−i)} [n+i; 2i]_{−1}.
At q=−1, a special case of q–Lucas (base 2) gives
  [n; k]_{−1} = 0 if n is even and k is odd; otherwise [n; k]_{−1} = binom(⌊n/2⌋, ⌊k/2⌋).
For odd n=2t+1 the phase v^{−2i(n−i)}=(−1)^{i(n−i)} equals 1 for all i, so
  a_2(2t+1) = ∑_{i=0}^{2t+1} binom(t+⌊(i+1)/2⌋, i).
Each summand with i≥1 strictly increases as t increases, hence the odd subsequence a_2(2t+1) is strictly increasing. Concretely, a_2(3)=5 and a_2(7)=40, so no period (in particular none dividing 2N=4) can exist. This disproves the periodicity claim. ∎

Remark. The above also shows that a_N(n) is well-defined (independent of the choice of square root v) in this problem, because K=2i makes K(N−K) even in the conversion formula.


=== Round 1 Summary ===

Clarified the intended problem (fix N and set q=ζ_N). Key tools: conversion between symmetrized and standard q-binomial coefficients (factor q^{-k(n-k)/2}), an n-OGF Σ_n f_n(q)t^n = Σ_{i≥0} t^i/∏_{s=-i}^i(1−t q^s), and q–Lucas reductions at roots of unity. Using these, the periodicity claim is false: explicit counterexamples show a_1(n)=f_n(1)=F_{2n+1} and a_2(n)=f_n(−1)=F_{n+2}, so the sequences are unbounded and not periodic. A residue-class decomposition at fixed N further suggests subsequences g_s(x)=a_N(xN+s) satisfy a linear recurrence g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)−g_s(x), which also rules out nontrivial periodicity. Next steps are to formalize the q–Lucas reductions and the general recurrence proof, and to treat the alternate reading q=ζ_n separately. Citations: Research Notes; Current Proofs.


=== Previous Round Feedback ===

Overall assessment: the claim is false. We already have decisive counterexamples at N=1 and N=2. Prover 2 gives an unboundedness argument for N=2 via the specialization q = −1, which alone disproves periodicity (periodic sequences are bounded). Prover 3 sharpens this by deriving the exact formula a_2(n) = F_{n+2} from a clean generating-function computation, and also notes N=1 yields a_1(n) = F_{2n+1}. Either case refutes the statement. Prover 1 develops a much deeper structure: for fixed N, each subsequence along an arithmetic progression n ≡ s (mod N) satisfies the homogeneous linear recurrence g_s(x+2) = 3 g_s(x+1) − g_s(x), hence cannot be periodic unless identically zero. This, together with g_0(0)=1, can be used to disprove periodicity for any period P (not just multiples of N): if a_N(n) were P-periodic, then for each s, g_s would be periodic with period P/gcd(P,N), contradicting the recurrence unless g_s ≡ 0.

Audit of details:
- Relation between symmetric and Gaussian q-binomials is correctly handled: for b = 2i even, no sign ambiguity in v appears, and f_n depends only on q = v^2.
- Prover 1’s q-Lucas-at-ζ_N factorization is standard and correct, but should be stated precisely (with the condition b_0 ≤ a_0 and a short proof or reference). The vanishing of the (δ=0, c=1) terms is correct (since then b_0 > a_0).
- Fibonacci diagonal sums are correct and easy to verify by a short induction using Pascal identities.
- Prover 2’s numerical sample for N=2 seems off (the exact values are F_{n+2}); the unboundedness bound a_2(2m+1) ≥ 2^m is fine and sufficient.
- Prover 3’s generating-function derivations for N=1 and N=2 are correct and provide neat closed forms.

Next steps:
- Write up a short, self-contained refutation using N=2 (q = −1): prove the −1 specialization lemma and deduce a_2(n) = F_{n+2}.
- Optionally, formalize Prover 1’s residue-class decomposition and the fixed recurrence for g_s(x); this yields a stronger structural theorem and a general nonperiodicity proof for all N.
- If a positive replacement is desired, investigate: (i) recurrences satisfied by a_N(n) modulo primes (Pisano-type periodicity), or (ii) explicit formulas for the constants A_s,B_s,C_s for small N.
