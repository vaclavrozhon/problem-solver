Write (q;q)_m=\u220f_{j=1}^m(1\u2212q^j). The order of vanishing at q=\u03b6_N equals \u230am/N\u230b, coming from factors 1\u2212q^{N},1\u2212q^{2N},\u2026. In the ratio [a;b]_q=(q;q)_a/((q;q)_b(q;q)_{a\u2212b}), the net order is \u230aa/N\u230b\u2212\u230ab/N\u230b\u2212\u230a(a\u2212b)/N\u230b, which equals 1 iff b_0>a_0 and 0 otherwise. Thus b_0>a_0 forces vanishing. When b_0\u2264a_0, cancellation of vanishing factors leaves a finite value, and grouping the non-multiples-of-N factors into identical blocks yields the ordinary binomial C(a_1,b_1) from the block counts, times the residual small Gaussian [a_0;b_0]_q. This is the standard q-Lucas theorem specialized at q=\u03b6_N.\\n\\nLemma 3 (Fibonacci diagonal sums)\\nFor x\u22650 and \u03b4,c\u2208{0,1}, define S_{\u03b4,c}(x)=\u2211_{y\u22650} binom(x+y+c, 2y+\u03b4). Then\\n  S_{0,0}(x)=F_{2x+1}, S_{1,0}(x)=F_{2x}, S_{1,1}(x)=F_{2x+2}, S_{0,1}(x)=F_{2x+3},\\nwhere F_n are Fibonacci numbers (F_0=0,F_1=1). Proof: Set S_0(x)=S_{0,0}(x), S_1(x)=S_{1,0}(x). Pascal\u2019s identity yields S_0(x+1)=S_0(x)+S_1(x) and S_1(x+1)=S_1(x)+S_0(x) with S_0(0)=1,S_1(0)=0, hence S_0(x)=F_{2x+1}, S_1(x)=F_{2x}. The c=1 cases follow by S_{\u03b4,1}(x)=S_{\u03b4,0}(x+1).\\n\\nProposition (Residue-class decomposition and recurrence)\\nFix N\u22651 and let q=\u03b6_N. For each s\u2208{0,\u2026,N\u22121} and x\u22650, write n=xN+s. Then\\n  f_{xN+s}(q) = \u2211_{r=0}^{N\u22121} q^{r(r\u2212s)} [a_0(r);b_0(r)]_q \u00b7 S_{\u03b4(r),c(r)}(x),\\nwhere for i=yN+r, r\u2208{0,\u2026,N\u22121} we set c(r)=\u230a(s+r)/N\u230b\u2208{0,1}, \u03b4(r)=\u230a2r/N\u230b\u2208{0,1}, a_0(r)=s+r\u2212c(r)N, b_0(r)=2r\u2212\u03b4(r)N. In particular, there exist constants A_s,B_s,C_s\u2208\u211a(\u03b6_N) such that\\n  g_s(x):=f_{xN+s}(q)=A_s F_{2x}+B_s F_{2x+1}+C_s F_{2x+2} for all x\u22650.\\nProof. By Lemma 1,\\n  f_{xN+s}(q)=\u2211_{i=0}^{xN+s} q^{i(i\u2212(xN+s))}[xN+s+i;2i]_q.\\nWrite i=yN+r. Then q^{i(i\u2212(xN+s))}=q^{r(r\u2212s)} since q^N=1. Let a=xN+s+i=(x+y+c)N+a_0, where c=c(r) and a_0=a_0(r). Let b=2i=(2y+\u03b4)N+b_0, where \u03b4=\u03b4(r), b_0=b_0(r). Applying Lemma 2 gives\\n  [a;b]_q = binom(x+y+c,2y+\u03b4)[a_0;b_0]_q, with the convention that the term vanishes if b_0>a_0. The latter occurs exactly when \u03b4=0 and c=1 (since then b_0=2r and a_0=s+r\u2212N with 2r\u2212(s+r\u2212N)=r\u2212s+N>0). Summing over y\u22650 and using Lemma 3 yields the stated decomposition and, therefore, the claimed linear form in F_{2x},F_{2x+1},F_{2x+2}.\\nConsequently, for each s the subsequence g_s(x)=f_{xN+s}(q) satisfies the homogeneous linear recurrence\\n  g_s(x+2)=3 g_s(x+1)\u2212g_s(x) for all x\u22650.\\n\\nCorollary (Nonperiodicity for every N)\\nIf a_N(n)=f_n(\u03b6_N) were periodic with period P>0, then with M=lcm(P,N) the subsequences g_s(x)=a_N(xN+s) would be periodic with period M/N. But any periodic sequence satisfying g(x+2)=3g(x+1)\u2212g(x) must be identically zero (its characteristic roots (3\u00b1\u221a5)/2 have modulus \u22601, so nonzero solutions are unbounded). Since g_0(0)=f_0(\u03b6_N)=1, g_0 is not identically zero. Contradiction. Hence {a_N(n)} is not periodic for any N\u22651.\\n\\nConcrete counterexamples\\n- N=1: q=1. Then f_n(1)=\u2211_{i=0}^n binom(n+i,2i)=F_{2n+1} (GF proof: \u2211_{n\u22650} f_n(1)t^n=(1\u2212t)/(1\u22123t+t^2)). This is not periodic.\\n- N=2: q=\u22121. Lemma 2 with N=2 gives [m;r]_{\u22121}=0 if m even and r odd; otherwise [m;r]_{\u22121}=binom(\u230am/2\u230b,\u230ar/2\u230b). Using Lemma 1 and that q^{i(i\u2212n)} equals 1 for n odd and (\u22121)^i for n even, we get for odd n=2t+1\\n  f_{2t+1}(\u22121)=\u2211_{i=0}^{2t+1} binom(t+\u230a(i+1)/2\u230b, i),\\nwhich is strictly increasing in t (each term with i\u22651 increases by binom(t+\u230a(i+1)/2\u230b, i\u22121)>0). Thus the sequence is unbounded, and hence not periodic.\\n\\nObstacles\\n- The q-Lucas factorization at roots of unity is standard but should be carefully justified; we provided a valuation-based sketch. A full write-up can include a detailed grouping of (q;q)_m into length-N blocks.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Add a fully detailed proof of Lemma 2 (q-Lucas at \u03b6_N) for completeness.\\n- Compute the explicit coefficients A_s,B_s,C_s for small N (e.g., N=3,4) to illustrate the decomposition and verify numerically the recurrence g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)\u2212g_s(x).\\n- Investigate periodicity modulo primes (Pisano-type phenomena): since g_s satisfies a fixed linear recurrence with algebraic integer coefficients, the reductions modulo p are eventually periodic.\\n\"}",
