Ideas
- Convert the symmetric Gaussian binomial to the standard one with q=v^2 to expose a simple q-power factor. This reduces the evaluation at roots of unity to standard Gaussian coefficients.
- Use the q-Lucas theorem at q=ζ_N to factor each term into an ordinary binomial depending on the block indices and a small Gaussian depending only on residues modulo N.
- Sum the ordinary binomial tails to Fibonacci numbers. This yields, for each residue class n≡s (mod N), a fixed linear recurrence in the progression index x.
- Conclude that no nontrivial periodicity in n can hold: the progression subsequences satisfy g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)−g_s(x), hence are not periodic unless identically 0; but g_0(0)=1.

Lemma 1 (symmetric vs standard q-binomials)
For integers a≥b≥0 and q=v^2,
  [a;b]_v = v^{b(b−a)} [a;b]_q = q^{b(b−a)/2} [a;b]_q.
Proof. Using [m]_v=(v^m−v^{−m})/(v−v^{−1})=v^{1−m}(1−q^m)/(1−q) and telescoping in the product defining [a;b]_v gives
  [a;b]_v = v^{∑_{j=0}^{b-1}(1−(a−j))−∑_{j=1}^{b}(1−j)} ∏_{j=0}^{b-1}rac{1−q^{a−j}}{1−q^{b−j}}
= v^{b(b−a)} [a;b]_q.
In particular, for a=n+i and b=2i,
  [n+i;2i]_v = q^{i(i−n)} [n+i;2i]_q.
Therefore
  f_n(q)=∑_{i=0}^n q^{i(i−n)} [n+i;2i]_q.

Lemma 2 (q-Lucas at a primitive N-th root)
Let q=ζ_N. For a,b≥0, write a=a_1N+a_0, b=b_1N+b_0 with 0≤a_0,b_0<N. Then
  [a;b]_q|_{q=ζ_N} = 0 if b_0>a_0,
  [a;b]_q|_{q=ζ_N} = C(a_1,b_1) · [a_0;b_0]_q|_{q=ζ_N} if b_0≤a_0,
where C(a_1,b_1)=binom(a_1,b_1).
Sketch of proof. Write (q;q)_m=∏_{j=1}^m(1−q^j). The order of vanishing at q=ζ_N equals ⌊m/N⌋, coming from factors 1−q^{N},1−q^{2N},…. In the ratio [a;b]_q=(q;q)_a/((q;q)_b(q;q)_{a−b}), the net order is ⌊a/N⌋−⌊b/N⌋−⌊(a−b)/N⌋, which equals 1 iff b_0>a_0 and 0 otherwise. Thus b_0>a_0 forces vanishing. When b_0≤a_0, cancellation of vanishing factors leaves a finite value, and grouping the non-multiples-of-N factors into identical blocks yields the ordinary binomial C(a_1,b_1) from the block counts, times the residual small Gaussian [a_0;b_0]_q. This is the standard q-Lucas theorem specialized at q=ζ_N.

Lemma 3 (Fibonacci diagonal sums)
For x≥0 and δ,c∈{0,1}, define S_{δ,c}(x)=∑_{y≥0} binom(x+y+c, 2y+δ). Then
  S_{0,0}(x)=F_{2x+1}, S_{1,0}(x)=F_{2x}, S_{1,1}(x)=F_{2x+2}, S_{0,1}(x)=F_{2x+3},
where F_n are Fibonacci numbers (F_0=0,F_1=1). Proof: Set S_0(x)=S_{0,0}(x), S_1(x)=S_{1,0}(x). Pascal’s identity yields S_0(x+1)=S_0(x)+S_1(x) and S_1(x+1)=S_1(x)+S_0(x) with S_0(0)=1,S_1(0)=0, hence S_0(x)=F_{2x+1}, S_1(x)=F_{2x}. The c=1 cases follow by S_{δ,1}(x)=S_{δ,0}(x+1).

Proposition (Residue-class decomposition and recurrence)
Fix N≥1 and let q=ζ_N. For each s∈{0,…,N−1} and x≥0, write n=xN+s. Then
  f_{xN+s}(q) = ∑_{r=0}^{N−1} q^{r(r−s)} [a_0(r);b_0(r)]_q · S_{δ(r),c(r)}(x),
where for i=yN+r, r∈{0,…,N−1} we set c(r)=⌊(s+r)/N⌋∈{0,1}, δ(r)=⌊2r/N⌋∈{0,1}, a_0(r)=s+r−c(r)N, b_0(r)=2r−δ(r)N. In particular, there exist constants A_s,B_s,C_s∈ℚ(ζ_N) such that
  g_s(x):=f_{xN+s}(q)=A_s F_{2x}+B_s F_{2x+1}+C_s F_{2x+2} for all x≥0.
Proof. By Lemma 1,
  f_{xN+s}(q)=∑_{i=0}^{xN+s} q^{i(i−(xN+s))}[xN+s+i;2i]_q.
Write i=yN+r. Then q^{i(i−(xN+s))}=q^{r(r−s)} since q^N=1. Let a=xN+s+i=(x+y+c)N+a_0, where c=c(r) and a_0=a_0(r). Let b=2i=(2y+δ)N+b_0, where δ=δ(r), b_0=b_0(r). Applying Lemma 2 gives
  [a;b]_q = binom(x+y+c,2y+δ)[a_0;b_0]_q, with the convention that the term vanishes if b_0>a_0. The latter occurs exactly when δ=0 and c=1 (since then b_0=2r and a_0=s+r−N with 2r−(s+r−N)=r−s+N>0). Summing over y≥0 and using Lemma 3 yields the stated decomposition and, therefore, the claimed linear form in F_{2x},F_{2x+1},F_{2x+2}.
Consequently, for each s the subsequence g_s(x)=f_{xN+s}(q) satisfies the homogeneous linear recurrence
  g_s(x+2)=3 g_s(x+1)−g_s(x) for all x≥0.

Corollary (Nonperiodicity for every N)
If a_N(n)=f_n(ζ_N) were periodic with period P>0, then with M=lcm(P,N) the subsequences g_s(x)=a_N(xN+s) would be periodic with period M/N. But any periodic sequence satisfying g(x+2)=3g(x+1)−g(x) must be identically zero (its characteristic roots (3±√5)/2 have modulus ≠1, so nonzero solutions are unbounded). Since g_0(0)=f_0(ζ_N)=1, g_0 is not identically zero. Contradiction. Hence {a_N(n)} is not periodic for any N≥1.

Concrete counterexamples
- N=1: q=1. Then f_n(1)=∑_{i=0}^n binom(n+i,2i)=F_{2n+1} (GF proof: ∑_{n≥0} f_n(1)t^n=(1−t)/(1−3t+t^2)). This is not periodic.
- N=2: q=−1. Lemma 2 with N=2 gives [m;r]_{−1}=0 if m even and r odd; otherwise [m;r]_{−1}=binom(⌊m/2⌋,⌊r/2⌋). Using Lemma 1 and that q^{i(i−n)} equals 1 for n odd and (−1)^i for n even, we get for odd n=2t+1
  f_{2t+1}(−1)=∑_{i=0}^{2t+1} binom(t+⌊(i+1)/2⌋, i),
which is strictly increasing in t (each term with i≥1 increases by binom(t+⌊(i+1)/2⌋, i−1)>0). Thus the sequence is unbounded, and hence not periodic.

Obstacles
- The q-Lucas factorization at roots of unity is standard but should be carefully justified; we provided a valuation-based sketch. A full write-up can include a detailed grouping of (q;q)_m into length-N blocks.

Next steps
- Add a fully detailed proof of Lemma 2 (q-Lucas at ζ_N) for completeness.
- Compute the explicit coefficients A_s,B_s,C_s for small N (e.g., N=3,4) to illustrate the decomposition and verify numerically the recurrence g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)−g_s(x).
- Investigate periodicity modulo primes (Pisano-type phenomena): since g_s satisfies a fixed linear recurrence with algebraic integer coefficients, the reductions modulo p are eventually periodic.
