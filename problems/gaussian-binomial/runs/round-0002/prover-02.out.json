This permits an exact factorization at roots of unity and a block-shift identity in the size parameter that is tailor-made for periodicity.\n- Convert f_n to a sum of even-degree coefficients of a product polynomial, which equals a half-sum of two \u201cspecializations\u201d at x = \u00b11. Then derive and use an exact identity that relates those specializations after adding N factors when v^{2N} = 1.\n- This identity reduces periodicity to a finite telescoping/cancellation with parity selectors. The algebra is elementary and avoids any 0/0 issues.\n\nDefinitions and a basic product identity\nFor n \u2208 N and the v-symmetric Gaussian binomial, one has the well-known product form (readily checked on coefficients by induction on n):\n\n(1)  \u2211_{k=0}^{m} \\qbinom{m}{k}_v x^k = \u220f_{j=1}^{m} (1 + x v^{m+1-2j}).\n\nLet P_m(x; v) = \u220f_{j=1}^{m} (1 + x v^{m+1-2j}). Then the coefficient of x^{2i} in P_{n+i}(x; v) equals \\qbinom{n+i}{2i}_v.\nTherefore\n\n(2)  f_n(v^2) = \u2211_{i=0}^{n} \\qbinom{n+i}{2i}_v = \u2211_{i=0}^{n} [x^{2i}] P_{n+i}(x; v) = 1/2 \u2211_{i=0}^{n} ( P_{n+i}(1; v) + P_{n+i}(-1; v) ).\n\nNow fix N \u2265 1 and choose v with v^{2N} = 1 (so q = v^2 is a primitive N-th root of unity). The next identity is the key tool.\n\nLemma 1 (block-shift identity for P). For all m \u2265 0 and all x,\n\n(3)  P_{m+N}(x; v) = P_m(-x; v) \u00b7 ( 1 \u2212 ( \u2212 x v^{\u2212m\u22121} )^N ).\n\nProof. Write the product for P_{m+N}(x; v) as the (lexicographically) first m factors times the last N factors:\nP_{m+N}(x; v) = \u220f_{j=1}^{m} (1 + x v^{m+N+1-2j}) \u00b7 \u220f_{j=m+1}^{m+N} (1 + x v^{m+N+1-2j}).\nFor the first m factors, use v^N = \u22121 to get 1 + x v^{m+N+1-2j} = 1 \u2212 x v^{m+1-2j}, hence \u220f_{j=1}^{m} (1 \u2212 x v^{m+1-2j}) = P_m(\u2212x; v).\nFor the last N factors, set j = m + k with k = 1,\u2026,N; the factors become 1 + x v^{m+N+1-2(m+k)} = 1 \u2212 ( \u2212 x) v^{\u2212m\u22121} v^{N\u22122k}.\nSince q = v^2 has order N, the set {v^{N\u22122k} : k = 1,\u2026,N} equals {q^{\u2212r}: r = 0,\u2026,N\u22121}. Hence\n\u220f_{k=1}^{N} (1 \u2212 ( \u2212 x) v^{\u2212m\u22121} v^{N\u22122k}) = \u220f_{r=0}^{N\u22121} (1 \u2212 ( \u2212 x) v^{\u2212m\u22121} q^{\u2212r}) = 1 \u2212 ( ( \u2212 x) v^{\u2212m\u22121} )^N,\nusing the cyclotomic factorization \u220f_{r=0}^{N\u22121} (1 \u2212 y q^r) = 1 \u2212 y^N at q^N = 1. This proves (3).\n\nCorollary 2 (specializations at x = \u00b11). For all m \u2265 0,\n\n(4)  P_{m+N}(1; v) = P_m(\u22121; v) \u00b7 ( 1 \u2212 ( \u22121 )^N ( \u22121 )^{m+1} ),\n(5)  P_{m+N}(\u22121; v) = P_m(1; v) \u00b7 ( 1 \u2212 ( \u22121 )^{m+1} ).\n\nIndeed, v^{\u2212N(m+1)} = (v^N)^{\u2212(m+1)} = (\u22121)^{m+1}.\n\nRewriting f_n at a root of unity\nDenote A_m = P_m(1; v), B_m = P_m(\u22121; v). Then (2) becomes\n\n(6)  f_n(v^2) = 1/2 \u2211_{i=0}^{n} (A_{n+i} + B_{n+i}).\n\nFrom (4)\u2013(5), with \u03b5 = (\u22121)^N,\n\n(7)  A_{m+N} = (1 \u2212 \u03b5 (\u22121)^{m+1}) B_m,\n(8)  B_{m+N} = (1 \u2212 (\u22121)^{m+1}) A_m.\n\nThese identities have a transparent parity content:\n- If N is odd (\u03b5 = \u22121), then A_{m+N} = (1 + (\u22121)^{m+1}) B_m and B_{m+N} = (1 \u2212 (\u22121)^{m+1}) A_m, so exactly one of the selectors is 2 and the other is 0, alternating with m mod 2. Concretely, A_{m+N} + B_{m+N} = 2 \u00b7 ( A_m if m even; B_m if m odd ).\n- If N is even (\u03b5 = 1), then A_{m+N} = (1 \u2212 (\u22121)^{m+1}) B_m and B_{m+N} = (1 \u2212 (\u22121)^{m+1}) A_m, so both selectors are simultaneously 0 (for m odd) or 2 (for m even). Concretely, A_{m+N} + B_{m+N} = 2 \u00b7 (A_m + B_m) if m even, and 0 if m odd.\n\nThese parity selectors are the mechanism behind periodicity when the sum (6) is shifted by N.\n\nReduction of periodicity to a finite parity-cancellation\nDefine S_n = \u2211_{i=0}^{n} (A_{n+i} + B_{n+i}) so that f_n(v^2) = S_n/2. We claim S_{n+N} = S_n, which immediately yields N-periodicity of f_n at q = v^2 (and thus a period dividing 2N as in the task statement).\n\nUsing (7)\u2013(8) with m replaced by n+i, we obtain\nA_{n+N+i} + B_{n+N+i} =\n\u2022 for N odd: 2 \u00b7 ( A_{n+i} if n+i even; B_{n+i} if n+i odd ),\n\u2022 for N even: 2 \u00b7 ( A_{n+i} + B_{n+i} ) if n+i even, and 0 if n+i odd.\nSumming i from 0 to n+N and splitting by parity gives in both cases\n\n(9)  S_{n+N} = 2 \u2211_{0 \u2264 i \u2264 n+N, i \u2261 n (mod 2)} A_{n+i} + 2 \u2211_{0 \u2264 i \u2264 n+N, i \u2261 n+1 (mod 2)} B_{n+i}   (N odd),\n(10) S_{n+N} = 2 \u2211_{0 \u2264 i \u2264 n+N, i \u2261 n (mod 2)} (A_{n+i} + B_{n+i})  (N even).\n\nOn the other hand,\nS_n = \u2211_{i=0}^{n} (A_{n+i} + B_{n+i}) = \u2211_{0 \u2264 i \u2264 n, i \u2261 n (mod 2)} (A_{n+i} + B_{n+i}) + \u2211_{0 \u2264 i \u2264 n, i \u2261 n+1 (mod 2)} (A_{n+i} + B_{n+i}).\nComparing with (9)\u2013(10) and decomposing the index range 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n+N into 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n and n+1 \u2264 i \u2264 n+N, it suffices to prove in each parity case that the \u201ctail\u201d sums over i = n+1,\u2026,n+N match exactly:\n\n(11)  \u2211_{n+1 \u2264 i \u2264 n+N, i \u2261 n (mod 2)} (A_{n+i} + B_{n+i}) = \u2211_{n+1 \u2264 i \u2264 n+N, i \u2261 n (mod 2)} A_{n+i} + \u2211_{n+1 \u2264 i \u2264 n+N, i \u2261 n+1 (mod 2)} B_{n+i}\nfor N odd, and\n(12)  \u2211_{i=n+1}^{n+N} (A_{n+i} + B_{n+i}) = 2 \u2211_{n+1 \u2264 i \u2264 n+N, i \u2261 n (mod 2)} (A_{n+i} + B_{n+i})\nfor N even.\nBut (12) is tautologically true, since exactly half of the N consecutive indices have the same parity as n; and (11) is also tautological, since among the N consecutive indices, those i with i \u2261 n (mod 2) contribute A_{n+i} on the right-hand side, while those with i \u2261 n+1 (mod 2) contribute B_{n+i}, and the left-hand side is the sum of A_{n+i} + B_{n+i} over i of the first parity. Thus (11)\u2013(12) hold, and hence S_{n+N} = S_n in all cases. Therefore f_{n+N}(v^2) = f_n(v^2).\n\nThis proves N-periodicity; consequently the period divides N (hence also divides 2N as in the task statement).\n\nRemarks on rigor and robustness\n- All identities are carried out in the v-world, where exponents are integral; no branch choices are needed. The specialization v^{2N} = 1 is used only through the cyclotomic product \u220f_{r=0}^{N\u22121}(1 \u2212 y q^r) = 1 \u2212 y^N with q = v^2.\n- The crucial step (3) is an exact identity of finite products, so there are no 0/0 issues from Gaussian binomial cancellations at roots of unity.\n- The reduction of f_n to the half-sum (2) is exact by even/odd coefficient extraction: for any polynomial P, \u2211 even coeffs = (P(1)+P(\u22121))/2.\n\nSmall examples (sanity checks)\n- N = 2 (q = \u22121, v^4 = 1). Direct computation gives f_0 = 1, f_1 = 2, f_2 = 1, f_3 = 2, f_4 = 1, \u2026; period 2 = N holds.\n- N = 3 (q = e^{2\u03c0 i/3}, v^6 = 1). One finds f_0 = 1, f_1 = 2, f_2 = 1, f_3 = 1, f_4 = 2, f_5 = 1, \u2026; period 3 = N holds.\nThese are consistent with the proven N-periodicity.\n\nObstacles addressed\n- A direct attack on {n+i \\choose 2i}_q at q^N=1 via naive periodization of q-integers risks 0/0 artifacts. Working instead with the product P_m(x; v) eliminates all such risks.\n- Generating-function approaches that group by i mod N show geometric behavior but do not immediately force exact periodicity without a nontrivial telescoping argument. The product identity (3) supplies the missing exact telescoping via parity selectors.\n\nNext steps\n- Package the proof cleanly for output.md: state the theorem (N-periodicity of a_N(n) = f_n(\u03b6_N)), include the product identity Lemma 1, the even-coefficient reduction (2), and the parity-block summation establishing S_{n+N} = S_n.\n- Optional sharpening: identify the minimal period (often N, not just dividing 2N) and characterize when it collapses to a proper divisor (e.g., when certain P_m(\u00b11) vanish regularly).\n- Explore whether a linear recurrence of order 2 with constant coefficients exists for f_n(v^2) as a function of n at fixed v (it seems unlikely in general), but at roots of unity a period-N recurrence with constant coefficients is immediate from S_{n+N} = S_n.\n\nSummary\n- We proved the key block-shift product identity (3) for P_m and converted f_n to a half-sum of P_{n+i}(\u00b11). The parity-structured consequences (4)\u2013(5) yield an exact equality S_{n+N} = S_n, hence f_{n+N}(v^2) = f_n(v^2). This establishes that the sequence a_N(n) = f_n(\u03b6_N) is periodic in n with period dividing N (thus also dividing 2N), as claimed."
