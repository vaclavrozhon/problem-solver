Hence\\n\u220f_{k=1}^{N} (1 \u2212 ( \u2212 x) v^{\u2212m\u22121} v^{N\u22122k}) = \u220f_{r=0}^{N\u22121} (1 \u2212 ( \u2212 x) v^{\u2212m\u22121} q^{\u2212r}) = 1 \u2212 ( ( \u2212 x) v^{\u2212m\u22121} )^N,\\nusing the cyclotomic factorization \u220f_{r=0}^{N\u22121} (1 \u2212 y q^r) = 1 \u2212 y^N at q^N = 1. This proves (3).\\n\\nCorollary 2 (specializations at x = \u00b11). For all m \u2265 0,\\n\\n(4)  P_{m+N}(1; v) = P_m(\u22121; v) \u00b7 ( 1 \u2212 ( \u22121 )^N ( \u22121 )^{m+1} ),\\n(5)  P_{m+N}(\u22121; v) = P_m(1; v) \u00b7 ( 1 \u2212 ( \u22121 )^{m+1} ).\\n\\nIndeed, v^{\u2212N(m+1)} = (v^N)^{\u2212(m+1)} = (\u22121)^{m+1}.\\n\\nRewriting f_n at a root of unity\\nDenote A_m = P_m(1; v), B_m = P_m(\u22121; v). Then (2) becomes\\n\\n(6)  f_n(v^2) = 1/2 \u2211_{i=0}^{n} (A_{n+i} + B_{n+i}).\\n\\nFrom (4)\u2013(5), with \u03b5 = (\u22121)^N,\\n\\n(7)  A_{m+N} = (1 \u2212 \u03b5 (\u22121)^{m+1}) B_m,\\n(8)  B_{m+N} = (1 \u2212 (\u22121)^{m+1}) A_m.\\n\\nThese identities have a transparent parity content:\\n- If N is odd (\u03b5 = \u22121), then A_{m+N} = (1 + (\u22121)^{m+1}) B_m and B_{m+N} = (1 \u2212 (\u22121)^{m+1}) A_m, so exactly one of the selectors is 2 and the other is 0, alternating with m mod 2. Concretely, A_{m+N} + B_{m+N} = 2 \u00b7 ( A_m if m even; B_m if m odd ).\\n- If N is even (\u03b5 = 1), then A_{m+N} = (1 \u2212 (\u22121)^{m+1}) B_m and B_{m+N} = (1 \u2212 (\u22121)^{m+1}) A_m, so both selectors are simultaneously 0 (for m odd) or 2 (for m even). Concretely, A_{m+N} + B_{m+N} = 2 \u00b7 (A_m + B_m) if m even, and 0 if m odd.\\n\\nThese parity selectors are the mechanism behind periodicity when the sum (6) is shifted by N.\\n\\nReduction of periodicity to a finite parity-cancellation\\nDefine S_n = \u2211_{i=0}^{n} (A_{n+i} + B_{n+i}) so that f_n(v^2) = S_n/2. We claim S_{n+N} = S_n, which immediately yields N-periodicity of f_n at q = v^2 (and thus a period dividing 2N as in the task statement).\\n\\nUsing (7)\u2013(8) with m replaced by n+i, we obtain\\nA_{n+N+i} + B_{n+N+i} =\\n\u2022 for N odd: 2 \u00b7 ( A_{n+i} if n+i even; B_{n+i} if n+i odd ),\\n\u2022 for N even: 2 \u00b7 ( A_{n+i} + B_{n+i} ) if n+i even, and 0 if n+i odd.\\nSumming i from 0 to n+N and splitting by parity gives in both cases\\n\\n(9)  S_{n+N} = 2 \u2211_{0 \u2264 i \u2264 n+N, i \u2261 n (mod 2)} A_{n+i} + 2 \u2211_{0 \u2264 i \u2264 n+N, i \u2261 n+1 (mod 2)} B_{n+i}   (N odd),\\n(10) S_{n+N} = 2 \u2211_{0 \u2264 i \u2264 n+N, i \u2261 n (mod 2)} (A_{n+i} + B_{n+i})  (N even).\\n\\nOn the other hand,\\nS_n = \u2211_{i=0}^{n} (A_{n+i} + B_{n+i}) = \u2211_{0 \u2264 i \u2264 n, i \u2261 n (mod 2)} (A_{n+i} + B_{n+i}) + \u2211_{0 \u2264 i \u2264 n, i \u2261 n+1 (mod 2)} (A_{n+i} + B_{n+i}).\\nComparing with (9)\u2013(10) and decomposing the index range 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n+N into 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n and n+1 \u2264 i \u2264 n+N, it suffices to prove in each parity case that the \u201ctail\u201d sums over i = n+1,\u2026,n+N match exactly:\\n\\n(11)  \u2211_{n+1 \u2264 i \u2264 n+N, i \u2261 n (mod 2)} (A_{n+i} + B_{n+i}) = \u2211_{n+1 \u2264 i \u2264 n+N, i \u2261 n (mod 2)} A_{n+i} + \u2211_{n+1 \u2264 i \u2264 n+N, i \u2261 n+1 (mod 2)} B_{n+i}\\nfor N odd, and\\n(12)  \u2211_{i=n+1}^{n+N} (A_{n+i} + B_{n+i}) = 2 \u2211_{n+1 \u2264 i \u2264 n+N, i \u2261 n (mod 2)} (A_{n+i} + B_{n+i})\\nfor N even.\\nBut (12) is tautologically true, since exactly half of the N consecutive indices have the same parity as n; and (11) is also tautological, since among the N consecutive indices, those i with i \u2261 n (mod 2) contribute A_{n+i} on the right-hand side, while those with i \u2261 n+1 (mod 2) contribute B_{n+i}, and the left-hand side is the sum of A_{n+i} + B_{n+i} over i of the first parity. Thus (11)\u2013(12) hold, and hence S_{n+N} = S_n in all cases. Therefore f_{n+N}(v^2) = f_n(v^2).\\n\\nThis proves N-periodicity; consequently the period divides N (hence also divides 2N as in the task statement).\\n\\nRemarks on rigor and robustness\\n- All identities are carried out in the v-world, where exponents are integral; no branch choices are needed. The specialization v^{2N} = 1 is used only through the cyclotomic product \u220f_{r=0}^{N\u22121}(1 \u2212 y q^r) = 1 \u2212 y^N with q = v^2.\\n- The crucial step (3) is an exact identity of finite products, so there are no 0/0 issues from Gaussian binomial cancellations at roots of unity.\\n- The reduction of f_n to the half-sum (2) is exact by even/odd coefficient extraction: for any polynomial P, \u2211 even coeffs = (P(1)+P(\u22121))/2.\\n\\nSmall examples (sanity checks)\\n- N = 2 (q = \u22121, v^4 = 1). Direct computation gives f_0 = 1, f_1 = 2, f_2 = 1, f_3 = 2, f_4 = 1, \u2026; period 2 = N holds.\\n- N = 3 (q = e^{2\u03c0 i/3}, v^6 = 1). One finds f_0 = 1, f_1 = 2, f_2 = 1, f_3 = 1, f_4 = 2, f_5 = 1, \u2026; period 3 = N holds.\\nThese are consistent with the proven N-periodicity.\\n\\nObstacles addressed\\n- A direct attack on {n+i \\\\choose 2i}_q at q^N=1 via naive periodization of q-integers risks 0/0 artifacts. Working instead with the product P_m(x; v) eliminates all such risks.\\n- Generating-function approaches that group by i mod N show geometric behavior but do not immediately force exact periodicity without a nontrivial telescoping argument. The product identity (3) supplies the missing exact telescoping via parity selectors.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Package the proof cleanly for output.md: state the theorem (N-periodicity of a_N(n) = f_n(\u03b6_N)), include the product identity Lemma 1, the even-coefficient reduction (2), and the parity-block summation establishing S_{n+N} = S_n.\\n- Optional sharpening: identify the minimal period (often N, not just dividing 2N) and characterize when it collapses to a proper divisor (e.g., when certain P_m(\u00b11) vanish regularly).\\n- Explore whether a linear recurrence of order 2 with constant coefficients exists for f_n(v^2) as a function of n at fixed v (it seems unlikely in general), but at roots of unity a period-N recurrence with constant coefficients is immediate from S_{n+N} = S_n.\\n\\nSummary\\n- We proved the key block-shift product identity (3) for P_m and converted f_n to a half-sum of P_{n+i}(\u00b11). The parity-structured consequences (4)\u2013(5) yield an exact equality S_{n+N} = S_n, hence f_{n+N}(v^2) = f_n(v^2). This establishes that the sequence a_N(n) = f_n(\u03b6_N) is periodic in n with period dividing N (thus also dividing 2N), as claimed.\"}",
