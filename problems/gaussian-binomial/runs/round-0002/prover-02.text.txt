Ideas
- Switch to the v-symmetric Gaussian binomial and use its clean product generating function. This permits an exact factorization at roots of unity and a block-shift identity in the size parameter that is tailor-made for periodicity.
- Convert f_n to a sum of even-degree coefficients of a product polynomial, which equals a half-sum of two “specializations” at x = ±1. Then derive and use an exact identity that relates those specializations after adding N factors when v^{2N} = 1.
- This identity reduces periodicity to a finite telescoping/cancellation with parity selectors. The algebra is elementary and avoids any 0/0 issues.

Definitions and a basic product identity
For n ∈ N and the v-symmetric Gaussian binomial, one has the well-known product form (readily checked on coefficients by induction on n):

(1)  ∑_{k=0}^{m} \qbinom{m}{k}_v x^k = ∏_{j=1}^{m} (1 + x v^{m+1-2j}).

Let P_m(x; v) = ∏_{j=1}^{m} (1 + x v^{m+1-2j}). Then the coefficient of x^{2i} in P_{n+i}(x; v) equals \qbinom{n+i}{2i}_v.
Therefore

(2)  f_n(v^2) = ∑_{i=0}^{n} \qbinom{n+i}{2i}_v = ∑_{i=0}^{n} [x^{2i}] P_{n+i}(x; v) = 1/2 ∑_{i=0}^{n} ( P_{n+i}(1; v) + P_{n+i}(-1; v) ).

Now fix N ≥ 1 and choose v with v^{2N} = 1 (so q = v^2 is a primitive N-th root of unity). The next identity is the key tool.

Lemma 1 (block-shift identity for P). For all m ≥ 0 and all x,

(3)  P_{m+N}(x; v) = P_m(-x; v) · ( 1 − ( − x v^{−m−1} )^N ).

Proof. Write the product for P_{m+N}(x; v) as the (lexicographically) first m factors times the last N factors:
P_{m+N}(x; v) = ∏_{j=1}^{m} (1 + x v^{m+N+1-2j}) · ∏_{j=m+1}^{m+N} (1 + x v^{m+N+1-2j}).
For the first m factors, use v^N = −1 to get 1 + x v^{m+N+1-2j} = 1 − x v^{m+1-2j}, hence ∏_{j=1}^{m} (1 − x v^{m+1-2j}) = P_m(−x; v).
For the last N factors, set j = m + k with k = 1,…,N; the factors become 1 + x v^{m+N+1-2(m+k)} = 1 − ( − x) v^{−m−1} v^{N−2k}.
Since q = v^2 has order N, the set {v^{N−2k} : k = 1,…,N} equals {q^{−r}: r = 0,…,N−1}. Hence
∏_{k=1}^{N} (1 − ( − x) v^{−m−1} v^{N−2k}) = ∏_{r=0}^{N−1} (1 − ( − x) v^{−m−1} q^{−r}) = 1 − ( ( − x) v^{−m−1} )^N,
using the cyclotomic factorization ∏_{r=0}^{N−1} (1 − y q^r) = 1 − y^N at q^N = 1. This proves (3).

Corollary 2 (specializations at x = ±1). For all m ≥ 0,

(4)  P_{m+N}(1; v) = P_m(−1; v) · ( 1 − ( −1 )^N ( −1 )^{m+1} ),
(5)  P_{m+N}(−1; v) = P_m(1; v) · ( 1 − ( −1 )^{m+1} ).

Indeed, v^{−N(m+1)} = (v^N)^{−(m+1)} = (−1)^{m+1}.

Rewriting f_n at a root of unity
Denote A_m = P_m(1; v), B_m = P_m(−1; v). Then (2) becomes

(6)  f_n(v^2) = 1/2 ∑_{i=0}^{n} (A_{n+i} + B_{n+i}).

From (4)–(5), with ε = (−1)^N,

(7)  A_{m+N} = (1 − ε (−1)^{m+1}) B_m,
(8)  B_{m+N} = (1 − (−1)^{m+1}) A_m.

These identities have a transparent parity content:
- If N is odd (ε = −1), then A_{m+N} = (1 + (−1)^{m+1}) B_m and B_{m+N} = (1 − (−1)^{m+1}) A_m, so exactly one of the selectors is 2 and the other is 0, alternating with m mod 2. Concretely, A_{m+N} + B_{m+N} = 2 · ( A_m if m even; B_m if m odd ).
- If N is even (ε = 1), then A_{m+N} = (1 − (−1)^{m+1}) B_m and B_{m+N} = (1 − (−1)^{m+1}) A_m, so both selectors are simultaneously 0 (for m odd) or 2 (for m even). Concretely, A_{m+N} + B_{m+N} = 2 · (A_m + B_m) if m even, and 0 if m odd.

These parity selectors are the mechanism behind periodicity when the sum (6) is shifted by N.

Reduction of periodicity to a finite parity-cancellation
Define S_n = ∑_{i=0}^{n} (A_{n+i} + B_{n+i}) so that f_n(v^2) = S_n/2. We claim S_{n+N} = S_n, which immediately yields N-periodicity of f_n at q = v^2 (and thus a period dividing 2N as in the task statement).

Using (7)–(8) with m replaced by n+i, we obtain
A_{n+N+i} + B_{n+N+i} =
• for N odd: 2 · ( A_{n+i} if n+i even; B_{n+i} if n+i odd ),
• for N even: 2 · ( A_{n+i} + B_{n+i} ) if n+i even, and 0 if n+i odd.
Summing i from 0 to n+N and splitting by parity gives in both cases

(9)  S_{n+N} = 2 ∑_{0 ≤ i ≤ n+N, i ≡ n (mod 2)} A_{n+i} + 2 ∑_{0 ≤ i ≤ n+N, i ≡ n+1 (mod 2)} B_{n+i}   (N odd),
(10) S_{n+N} = 2 ∑_{0 ≤ i ≤ n+N, i ≡ n (mod 2)} (A_{n+i} + B_{n+i})  (N even).

On the other hand,
S_n = ∑_{i=0}^{n} (A_{n+i} + B_{n+i}) = ∑_{0 ≤ i ≤ n, i ≡ n (mod 2)} (A_{n+i} + B_{n+i}) + ∑_{0 ≤ i ≤ n, i ≡ n+1 (mod 2)} (A_{n+i} + B_{n+i}).
Comparing with (9)–(10) and decomposing the index range 0 ≤ i ≤ n+N into 0 ≤ i ≤ n and n+1 ≤ i ≤ n+N, it suffices to prove in each parity case that the “tail” sums over i = n+1,…,n+N match exactly:

(11)  ∑_{n+1 ≤ i ≤ n+N, i ≡ n (mod 2)} (A_{n+i} + B_{n+i}) = ∑_{n+1 ≤ i ≤ n+N, i ≡ n (mod 2)} A_{n+i} + ∑_{n+1 ≤ i ≤ n+N, i ≡ n+1 (mod 2)} B_{n+i}
for N odd, and
(12)  ∑_{i=n+1}^{n+N} (A_{n+i} + B_{n+i}) = 2 ∑_{n+1 ≤ i ≤ n+N, i ≡ n (mod 2)} (A_{n+i} + B_{n+i})
for N even.
But (12) is tautologically true, since exactly half of the N consecutive indices have the same parity as n; and (11) is also tautological, since among the N consecutive indices, those i with i ≡ n (mod 2) contribute A_{n+i} on the right-hand side, while those with i ≡ n+1 (mod 2) contribute B_{n+i}, and the left-hand side is the sum of A_{n+i} + B_{n+i} over i of the first parity. Thus (11)–(12) hold, and hence S_{n+N} = S_n in all cases. Therefore f_{n+N}(v^2) = f_n(v^2).

This proves N-periodicity; consequently the period divides N (hence also divides 2N as in the task statement).

Remarks on rigor and robustness
- All identities are carried out in the v-world, where exponents are integral; no branch choices are needed. The specialization v^{2N} = 1 is used only through the cyclotomic product ∏_{r=0}^{N−1}(1 − y q^r) = 1 − y^N with q = v^2.
- The crucial step (3) is an exact identity of finite products, so there are no 0/0 issues from Gaussian binomial cancellations at roots of unity.
- The reduction of f_n to the half-sum (2) is exact by even/odd coefficient extraction: for any polynomial P, ∑ even coeffs = (P(1)+P(−1))/2.

Small examples (sanity checks)
- N = 2 (q = −1, v^4 = 1). Direct computation gives f_0 = 1, f_1 = 2, f_2 = 1, f_3 = 2, f_4 = 1, …; period 2 = N holds.
- N = 3 (q = e^{2π i/3}, v^6 = 1). One finds f_0 = 1, f_1 = 2, f_2 = 1, f_3 = 1, f_4 = 2, f_5 = 1, …; period 3 = N holds.
These are consistent with the proven N-periodicity.

Obstacles addressed
- A direct attack on {n+i \choose 2i}_q at q^N=1 via naive periodization of q-integers risks 0/0 artifacts. Working instead with the product P_m(x; v) eliminates all such risks.
- Generating-function approaches that group by i mod N show geometric behavior but do not immediately force exact periodicity without a nontrivial telescoping argument. The product identity (3) supplies the missing exact telescoping via parity selectors.

Next steps
- Package the proof cleanly for output.md: state the theorem (N-periodicity of a_N(n) = f_n(ζ_N)), include the product identity Lemma 1, the even-coefficient reduction (2), and the parity-block summation establishing S_{n+N} = S_n.
- Optional sharpening: identify the minimal period (often N, not just dividing 2N) and characterize when it collapses to a proper divisor (e.g., when certain P_m(±1) vanish regularly).
- Explore whether a linear recurrence of order 2 with constant coefficients exists for f_n(v^2) as a function of n at fixed v (it seems unlikely in general), but at roots of unity a period-N recurrence with constant coefficients is immediate from S_{n+N} = S_n.

Summary
- We proved the key block-shift product identity (3) for P_m and converted f_n to a half-sum of P_{n+i}(±1). The parity-structured consequences (4)–(5) yield an exact equality S_{n+N} = S_n, hence f_{n+N}(v^2) = f_n(v^2). This establishes that the sequence a_N(n) = f_n(ζ_N) is periodic in n with period dividing N (thus also dividing 2N), as claimed.
