  "content": "Ideas and scope\n- The current claim (periodicity for fixed N) is false. The writeup contains a valid counterexample strategy for N=2, but there are gaps and a numerical error that should be corrected. Including N=1 gives an even simpler counterexample.\n- Clarify well-posedness: since b=2i is even in every summand, the symmetric Gaussian coefficient depends only on q=v^2 (not on the choice of v). This should be stated and proved once.\n- Some heuristic statements about rationality of generating functions and universal recurrences are unsupported and likely incorrect; they should be removed or clearly marked as speculation.\n\nErrors and corrections\n1) Incorrect value: the text states a_2(7)=40. The correct value is a_2(7)=F_9=34 (see the generating-function derivation below). This should be fixed.\n2) Missing simpler counterexample: N=1 gives a_1(n)=f_n(1)=\u2211_{i=0}^n \\binom{n+i}{2i}=F_{2n+1}, which is unbounded and not periodic. This should be added because it is fully elementary and short.\n3) Ambiguity of problem variants: the Notes mix two problems (A) q=\u03b6_n varying with n and (B) fixed N, q=\u03b6_N. The task is clearly (B). All statements and computations for (A) should be segregated or removed to avoid confusion.\n\nGaps needing proofs (with proposed fixes)\nA) Independence from the choice of v.\nLemma. For 0\u2264b\u2264a, [a;b]_{\u2212v} = (\u22121)^{b(a\u2212b)} [a;b]_v. In particular, when b is even, [a;b]_v depends only on q=v^2.\nProof. Use [m]_{\u2212v}=(\u22121)^{m\u22121}[m]_v and count exponents in numerator/denominator. The net exponent is b(a\u2212b).\nB) Exact evaluation at q=1.\nClaim. f_n(1)=\u2211_{i=0}^n \\binom{n+i}{2i}=F_{2n+1}.\nProof. For |x| small,\n\u2211_{n\u22650} f_n(1)x^n = \u2211_{i\u22650} x^i \u2211_{m\u22650} \\binom{m+2i}{2i} x^m = \u2211_{i\u22650} x^i/(1\u2212x)^{2i+1} = (1\u2212x)/(1\u22123x+x^2).\nThis is the OGF of (F_{2n+1})_{n\u22650}.\nC) Clean derivation for N=2 (q=\u22121): a_2(n)=F_{n+2}.\nOne route is via the well-known specialization \\qbinom{a}{b}_{\u22121} = 0 if a even and b odd, otherwise \\binom{\u230aa/2\u230b}{\u230ab/2\u230b}. Then\nf_n(\u22121)=\u2211_{i=0}^n \\binom{\u230a(n+i)/2\u230b}{i},\nwhose ordinary generating function is (1+x)/(1\u2212x\u2212x^2), yielding f_n(\u22121)=F_{n+2}. Alternatively, a direct generating-function computation using\n\u2211_{n\u22650} f_n(\u22121)x^n = \u2211_{i\u22650} x^i/\u220f_{s=\u2212i}^i (1\u2212x(\u22121)^s)\nreduces to the same rational form by splitting i even/odd and summing two geometric series. Either proof is short and self-contained.\n\nMisleading or unsupported heuristics to revise\n- \u201cThe OGF suggests \u2211_{n\u22650} f_n(\u03b6_N)t^n is rational with denominator a power of 1\u2212t^N.\u201d This is not justified: for each i the denominator is a product of factors among {1\u2212t\u03b6_N^r}, but as i grows, multiplicities grow unbounded, so an infinite sum of such terms need not be rational. This sentence should be removed or replaced by a precise, proved statement.\n- \u201cFor each residue class s, g_s(x)=a_N(xN+s) satisfies g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)\u2212g_s(x).\u201d This is asserted without proof. It is true for N=1,2 (because g_s is a Fibonacci subsequence), but there is no evidence it holds for general N. It should be either proved or dropped.\n\nClarity improvements\n- State explicitly that periodicity means exact equality in \u2102 (not up to phase) and that the proposed \u201cperiod dividing 2N\u201d was a heuristic that does not survive evaluation of the sum.\n- Keep notation consistent: clearly distinguish symmetric Gaussian [\u00b7;\u00b7]_v from standard Gaussian [\u00b7;\u00b7]_q and give the conversion [a;b]_v = v^{\u2212b(a\u2212b)} [a;b]_q with q=v^2.\n\nProposed streamlined refutation to include in output.md\n- Lemma (independence from v) as above.\n- N=1 counterexample: f_n(1)=F_{2n+1}, not periodic.\n- N=2 counterexample: f_n(\u22121)=F_{n+2}, not periodic. Correct the earlier numerical slip (a_2(7)=34, not 40).\nConclude: the claim \u201cfor fixed N, a_N(n) is periodic\u201d is false in general (it already fails for N=1,2), so the stronger addendum \u201cwith period dividing 2N\u201d is also false.\n\nNext steps (optional, if a positive result is sought)\n- Explore whether any N\u22653 yields periodicity (unlikely). Quick computations for N=3 up to, say, n=30 would likely show nonperiodicity; document explicit discrepancies f_n(\u03b6_3)\u2260f_{n+P}(\u03b6_3) for any small P.\n- If a weaker statement is intended, formulate and test it rigorously (e.g., congruences modulo \u03a6_N(q), or recurrences along subsequences n\u2261s mod N with coefficients depending on N and s). Avoid unsupported global recurrences.\n\nSummary of actionable edits\n- Fix the numerical error a_2(7)=34.\n- Add the N=1 counterexample via a one-line generating-function proof.\n- Replace the current N=2 argument with a short, rigorous derivation of a_2(n)=F_{n+2} (either via specialization or generating functions).\n- Insert the lemma proving independence of v.\n- Remove or clearly mark speculative claims about rational OGFs and universal recurrences unless proven."
