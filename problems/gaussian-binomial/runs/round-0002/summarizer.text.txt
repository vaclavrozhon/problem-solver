{"summary_md":"This round fixes the scope (fixed N, q=ζ_N) and disproves the periodicity claim. Main reductions: convert symmetrized q-binomials to standard ones so f_n(q)=∑_{i=0}^n q^{i(i−n)} binom_q(n+i,2i), and record the n-OGF ∑_n f_n(q)t^n = ∑_{i≥0} t^i/∏_{s=−i}^i(1−t q^s). Writing n=xN+s and i=yN+r and applying q–Lucas at q=ζ_N factors each summand; summing over y yields diagonal binomial sums equal to Fibonacci numbers. Hence each residue subsequence g_s(x)=a_N(xN+s) equals A_s F_{2x}+B_s F_{2x+1}+C_s F_{2x+2} and satisfies g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)−g_s(x), so is not periodic unless identically zero. Concrete counterexamples: N=1 gives F_{2n+1}; N=2 gives a_2(2t+1)=F_{2t+3}, a_2(2t)=F_{2t−1}, so {a_N(n)} is unbounded and nonperiodic.
