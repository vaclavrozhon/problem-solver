Overall status: The fixed-N claim is false. The Current Output provides a correct, self-contained counterexample for N=2 (q = −1), with explicit formulas a_2(2t+1) = F_{2t+3} and a_2(2t) = F_{2t−1}. This alone disproves periodicity for fixed N. One earlier numerical slip a_2(7) = 40 should be corrected to 34; the corrected Output already reflects this.

Prover 1: Strong and relevant. The conversion from symmetric to standard Gaussians is correct, and the use of q-Lucas at q = ζ_N is appropriate. The residue-class decomposition is sound, and the diagonal-sum identities yielding Fibonacci numbers are correct. The conclusion that for each residue s the subsequence g_s(x) = a_N(xN + s) satisfies g_s(x+2) = 3 g_s(x+1) − g_s(x) is compelling and, together with g_0(0) = 1, obstructs any 2N-period. Minor: please write out the q-Lucas-at-root-of-unity lemma in full detail (you gave a valuation sketch) and explicitly mention why the case (δ = 0, c = 1) vanishes (b_0 > a_0).

Prover 2: The product identity approach is attractive but incorrect as stated. Identity (3) fails in general (e.g., N = 3, m = 0 gives a sign mismatch), and the subsequent “sanity checks” (claiming period N for N = 2) contradict direct computation (a_2(3) = 5 ≠ 2). The set substitution {v^{N−2k}} = {q^{−r}} is invalid when N is odd (one factor is v^{−N} = −1, not a power of q). This path should be abandoned or corrected.

Prover 3: The invariance under v ↦ −v for even lower index b is correct and useful. However, the claimed a_2(n) = F_{n+2} is false (it ignores the q^{i(i−n)} twist). The corrected formulas in the Current Output are right; please update your derivation accordingly.

Next steps: (i) Record a complete proof of the q-Lucas specialization at q = ζ_N to support Prover 1’s decomposition. (ii) Add the short proof of the Fibonacci diagonal sums (now included). (iii) Optionally compute the coefficients A_s, B_s, C_s for small N to showcase nonperiodicity and growth. (iv) If desired, study periodicity modulo primes using the fixed second-order recurrence for each residue subsequence.
