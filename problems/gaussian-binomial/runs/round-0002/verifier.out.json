  "feedback_md": "Overall status: The fixed-N claim is false. The Current Output provides a correct, self-contained counterexample for N=2 (q = \u22121), with explicit formulas a_2(2t+1) = F_{2t+3} and a_2(2t) = F_{2t\u22121}. This alone disproves periodicity for fixed N. One earlier numerical slip a_2(7) = 40 should be corrected to 34; the corrected Output already reflects this.\n\nProver 1: Strong and relevant. The conversion from symmetric to standard Gaussians is correct, and the use of q-Lucas at q = \u03b6_N is appropriate. The residue-class decomposition is sound, and the diagonal-sum identities yielding Fibonacci numbers are correct. The conclusion that for each residue s the subsequence g_s(x) = a_N(xN + s) satisfies g_s(x+2) = 3 g_s(x+1) \u2212 g_s(x) is compelling and, together with g_0(0) = 1, obstructs any 2N-period. Minor: please write out the q-Lucas-at-root-of-unity lemma in full detail (you gave a valuation sketch) and explicitly mention why the case (\u03b4 = 0, c = 1) vanishes (b_0 > a_0).\n\nProver 2: The product identity approach is attractive but incorrect as stated. Identity (3) fails in general (e.g., N = 3, m = 0 gives a sign mismatch), and the subsequent \u201csanity checks\u201d (claiming period N for N = 2) contradict direct computation (a_2(3) = 5 \u2260 2). The set substitution {v^{N\u22122k}} = {q^{\u2212r}} is invalid when N is odd (one factor is v^{\u2212N} = \u22121, not a power of q). This path should be abandoned or corrected.\n\nProver 3: The invariance under v \u21a6 \u2212v for even lower index b is correct and useful. However, the claimed a_2(n) = F_{n+2} is false (it ignores the q^{i(i\u2212n)} twist). The corrected formulas in the Current Output are right; please update your derivation accordingly.\n\nNext steps: (i) Record a complete proof of the q-Lucas specialization at q = \u03b6_N to support Prover 1\u2019s decomposition. (ii) Add the short proof of the Fibonacci diagonal sums (now included). (iii) Optionally compute the coefficients A_s, B_s, C_s for small N to showcase nonperiodicity and growth. (iv) If desired, study periodicity modulo primes using the fixed second-order recurrence for each residue subsequence.",

Using [m]_v=(v^m\u2212v^{\u2212m})/(v\u2212v^{\u22121})=v^{1\u2212m}(1\u2212q^m)/(1\u2212q) and telescoping exponents in the product yields v^{\u2211_{j=0}^{b\u22121}(1\u2212(a\u2212j))\u2212\u2211_{j=0}^{b\u22121}(1\u2212(b\u2212j))}=v^{b(b\u2212a)}.\n\nLemma (evaluation of standard Gaussians at q=\u22121).

Induction on n yields the two cases as in the analysis: for n odd, H(2t+1,k)=C(t,\u230ak/2\u230b); for n even, H(2t,k)=0 if k odd and H(2t,k)=C(t,k/2) if k even.\n\nLemma (Fibonacci diagonal sums).

By the q=\u22121 lemma,\n  [n+i;2i]_{\u22121} = C(\u230a(2t+1+i)/2\u230b, i) = C(t+\u230a(i+1)/2\u230b, i).\nPartitioning i by parity gives\n  a_2(2t+1)=\u2211_{j=0}^t C(t+j, 2j) + \u2211_{j=0}^t C(t+j+1, 2j+1) = S_0(t) + S_1(t+1) = F_{2t+1} + F_{2t+2} = F_{2t+3}.\nFor n even, n=2t, the sign is (\u22121)^i.
