=== SYSTEM ===
You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md, proofs.md, and output.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers
- notes.md (informal progress & exploratory work so far)
- proofs.md (rigorous proofs & detailed mathematics so far)
- output.md (main results found so far)

**Three-tier file system guidelines**:
- **notes.md**: Readable, log of exploratory work, intuitions, failed attempts, ideas. Prefer appending. Replace only if old notes are clearly misleading. It should be self-contained: In particular, reading it should make sense without knowing the output of provers in past rounds. 

- **proofs.md**: Complete rigorous mathematical proofs with full details. Think twice before adding anything. Contains proven lemmas, theorems, and detailed derivations. Only add mathematically verified content here.
- **output.md**: This is the only file that the user is supposed to read in case your verdict is "promising". It has to be self-contained. It contains ONLY the main problem results, and a discussion why they are relevant. It is extremely selective. Think twice before promoting proofs from proofs.md to output.md. Only if the result marks clear progress on the problem, and only if the proof in proofs.md has been thoroughly vetted by provers and you, it can join output.md. Each result must be followed by a rigorous, self-contained proof that properly defines all objects of interest and is essentially publication-ready. 

Tasks:
1) Audit rigor: identify unjustified steps, false statements, missing lemmas; produce minimal counterexamples.
2) Triage value: separate genuine progress from noise.
3) Guide next steps: propose what provers should try next.

# Periodicity of $f_n(q)$ at a fixed root of unity — self-contained statement

Fix an integer $N\ge 1$. Let $v$ be a formal parameter and define

$$
[m]_v=\frac{v^{m}-v^{-m}}{v-v^{-1}},\qquad
\qbinom{a}{b}_v=\frac{[a]_v[a-1]_v\cdots[a-b+1]_v}{[b]_v[b-1]_v\cdots[1]_v},
$$

with the conventions $\qbinom{a}{0}_v=1$ and $\qbinom{a}{b}_v=0$ for $b<0$ or $b>a$. Set $q=v^{2}$ and, for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$, define

$$
f_n(q)=\sum_{i=0}^{n}\qbinom{n+i}{2i}_v .
$$

Let $\zeta_N=e^{2\pi i/N}$. Consider the sequence $a_N(n)=f_n(\zeta_N)$ for $n=0,1,2,\dots$.

**Claim.** The sequence $\{a_N(n)\}_{n\ge 0}$ is periodic in $n$ (for example, with period dividing $2N$).

# Research Notes



Problem: f_n(q)=\sum_{i=0}^n \qbinom{n+i}{2i} with [n]=(v^n−v^{−n})/(v−v^{−1}), q=v^2. Claim (original): the sequence (f_n(e^{2π i/n}))_n is periodic.

Clarifying the statement
- Two readings:
  (A) a(n)=f_n(ζ_n) with ζ_n=e^{2π i/n} (n varies with the root); this seems unlikely to be periodic.
  (B) Fix N and study a_N(n)=f_n(ζ_N); this plausibly is N-periodic.

Core identities
- Symmetrized vs standard Gaussian: for 0≤k≤n,
  \qbinom{n}{k}_{sym} = q^{−\frac{k(n−k)}2} \binom{n}{k}_q.
  Hence f_n(q)=\sum_{i=0}^n q^{i(i−n)}\,\binom{n+i}{2i}_q.
- n-OGF:
  \sum_{n≥0} f_n(q)t^n = \sum_{i≥0} \frac{t^i}{\prod_{s=−i}^{i}(1−t q^s)}.
- Half-sum at q=ζ_n:
  f_n(ζ_n)=2+\sum_{j=1}^{\lfloor n/2\rfloor} ζ_n^{−j(n−j)}\,\binom{n−j}{j}_q\big|_{q=ζ_n}.
  Derivation: apply q-Lucas with modulus n to (n+i,2i) and relabel j=n−i.

Computations and observations (reading A)
- Small n: f_2(ζ_2)=1, f_3(ζ_3)=1, f_4(ζ_4)=2, f_5(ζ_5)=2+ζ_5+ζ_5^4=2+2cos(2π/5), f_6(ζ_6)=2.
  Note: the minimal polynomial of 2+2cos(2π/5) is x^2−3x+1 (correction).
- These values already rule out very small periods, but do not yet rigorously disprove periodicity for (A).

Plausible corrected claim (reading B)
- Fix N and q=ζ_N. The OGF suggests \sum_{n≥0} f_n(q)t^n is rational with denominator a power of 1−t^N. If the global denominator reduces to 1−t^N, then n↦f_n(ζ_N) is exactly N-periodic.

Caveats
- The symmetrized q-Pascal recursion involves q^{1/2}; to avoid branch ambiguities at roots of unity, either work in v with q=v^2 (integer exponents) or use the standard q-Pascal identity and convert via the exact factor q^{−k(n−k)/2}.

Next steps
1) Disproving (A): Evaluate f_p(ζ_p) for p=7,11 via the half-sum to see whether values are pairwise distinct across infinitely many primes; aim to certify distinct minimal polynomials.
2) Proving (B): Group the OGF sum over i≡r (mod N) and show each grouped sum has denominator exactly 1−t^N (use ∏_{r=0}^{N−1}(1−t q^r)=1−t^N and telescoping across m). This would yield exact N-periodicity. Alternatively, derive a constant-coefficient linear recurrence for f_n(ζ_N).

Problem clarification and plan (fixed N)
- Task: Fix N and study a_N(n) = f_n(ζ_N) as n varies. Earlier rounds mistakenly analyzed the different problem q = e^{2π i/n} (root order tied to n). The correct setting is now fixed.

Core identities to use
- Symmetric–standard relation: [N;K]_sym(v) = v^{-K(N−K)} [N;K]_q with q=v^2. For our K=2i, K(N−K) is even, so a_N(n) is independent of the sign choice v↦−v for the fixed square root of q.
- q–Lucas at a primitive m-th root (standard Gaussian): Writing X = am + b, Y = cm + d with 0≤b,d<m, we have [X;Y]_q|_{q=ζ_m} = binom(a,c)·[b;d]_q|_{q=ζ_m}.

Immediate consequence: disproof for N=2
- Take q=ζ_2=−1, v^2=q (v=i). By q–Lucas with m=2,
  [n choose k]_{-1} = 0 if n even and k odd; else = binom(⌊n/2⌋, ⌊k/2⌋).
- Thus for odd n=2t+1, the phase v^{-2i(n−i)} = (−1)^{i(n−i)} = 1 for all i, and
  f_n(−1) = ∑_{i=0}^{2t+1} binom(t + ⌊(i+1)/2⌋, i), which is strictly increasing in t (each summand with i≥1 increases when t increases). Numerically: f_3(−1)=5, f_7(−1)=40. Hence the sequence is not periodic; the claimed period ≤ 2N = 4 is contradicted at n=3 vs 7.

Next steps
- Generalize the nonperiodicity argument for other fixed N using q–Lucas with base N. In particular, analyze the subsequence n=tN and the contributions from i multiples of N.
- Cleanly separate notes for the matched-order regime (q=e^{2π i/n}) as a distinct problem variant; do not mix it with the fixed-N analysis.

Disproof of the periodicity claim.

Setup: f_n(q)=\sum_{i=0}^n \qbinom{n+i}{2i}_v with q=v^2 and b=2i even, so \qbinom{a}{b}_v depends only on q. We study a_N(n)=f_n(\zeta_N).

Quick counterexamples:
- N=1: a_1(n)=\sum_i \binom{n+i}{2i}=F_{2n+1}, not periodic.
- N=2 (q=−1): Using the specialization \binom{a}{b}_{−1}=0 if a even, b odd; otherwise \binom{\lfloor a/2\rfloor}{\lfloor b/2\rfloor}, one gets a_2(n)=\sum_{i=0}^n \binom{\lfloor (n+i)/2\rfloor}{i}=F_{n+2}, not periodic (indeed unbounded).

Stronger structure (from residue-class decomposition): For fixed N, writing n=xN+s, one can group i=yN+r and use q-Lucas at q=\zeta_N to factor each summand into a residue-dependent constant times an ordinary binomial \binom{x+y+c}{2y+\delta}. Summing over y yields Fibonacci numbers F_{2x+\cdot}. Consequently, for each residue s the subsequence g_s(x)=a_N(xN+s) satisfies g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)−g_s(x), hence cannot be periodic unless identically zero (and g_0(0)=1). This provides a general nonperiodicity mechanism for all N.

Next steps:
- Formalize the q-Lucas-at-\zeta_N step and write the full recurrence proof.
- Explore periodicity modulo primes (Pisano-type) or closed forms for the coefficients in the decomposition for small N.

Clarified scope: We fix N and study a_N(n)=f_n(ζ_N). The earlier variant with q=ζ_n (order tied to n) is a different problem.

Key reductions:
- Symmetric vs standard Gaussian: for all a≥b≥0, with q=v^2, \qbinom{a}{b}_v = v^{b(b−a)} \qbinom{a}{b}_q. Thus f_n(q)=\sum_{i=0}^n q^{i(i−n)} \binom{n+i}{2i}_q (standard Gaussian).
- At q=ζ_N, write n=xN+s and i=yN+r. Then q^{i(i−n)}=ζ_N^{r(r−s)} depends only on residues. By q-Lucas at ζ_N, \binom{n+i}{2i}_{ζ_N}=\binom{x+y+c}{2y+δ}\,\binom{a_0}{b_0}_{ζ_N}, with δ=⌊2r/N⌋, c=⌊(s+r)/N⌋, a_0=s+r−cN, b_0=2r−δN. The case (δ=0,c=1) gives b_0>a_0 and hence vanishes.
- Fibonacci diagonal sums: S_0(x)=∑_{y≥0} \binom{x+y}{2y}=F_{2x+1}, S_1(x)=∑_{y≥0} \binom{x+y}{2y+1}=F_{2x}. Hence for each residue s, g_s(x):=a_N(xN+s)=A_sF_{2x}+B_sF_{2x+1}+C_sF_{2x+2} with constants A_s,B_s,C_s∈Q(ζ_N).
- Therefore g_s satisfies g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)−g_s(x). In particular, no g_s is periodic unless identically zero.

Counterexample (N=2): Using evaluation at q=−1 (see proofs), for odd n=2t+1 we get a_2(2t+1)=∑_{i=0}^{2t+1} \binom{t+⌊(i+1)/2⌋}{i}, which is strictly increasing in t (e.g., a_2(3)=5, a_2(5)=13). Hence {a_2(n)} is not periodic; the original claim is false.

Next steps: (i) Write a complete proof of q-Lucas at ζ_N and record the residue-class/Fibonacci decomposition rigorously. (ii) Compute A_s,B_s,C_s for small N to illustrate and quantify nonperiodicity. (iii) Optional: study periodicity modulo primes (Pisano-type behavior) using the constant-coefficient recurrence for g_s.

Disproof at fixed root (summary)\n- The fixed-N claim is false. For N=2 (q=−1) we obtain exact formulas: a_2(2t+1)=F_{2t+3}, a_2(2t)=F_{2t−1}. Hence {a_2(n)} is unbounded and not periodic. Numerical check: a_2: 1,2,1,5,2,13,5,34,13,…\n- Simpler also: N=1 gives a_1(n)=∑_{i=0}^n binom(n+i,2i)=F_{2n+1}, already nonperiodic.\n\nKey tools\n- Symmetric–standard Gaussian conversion: [A;K]_v = v^{−K(A−K)} [A\choose K]_{q}, q=v^2.\n- q–Lucas at a root of unity (m=2 here): [2a+b;2c+d]_{−1} = binom(a,c) if (b,d)≠(0,1), else 0.\n- Fibonacci sums: ∑_{j=0}^{t} binom(t+j,t−j) = F_{2t+1}, ∑_{j=0}^{t} binom(t+1+j,t−j) = F_{2t+2}, ∑_{j=0}^{t−1} binom(t+j,t−j−1)=F_{2t}.\n\nRetraction\n- Prior OGF heuristic predicting period N after specialization is incorrect in this context; repeated roots at ζ_N produce polynomial-exponential growth rather than periodicity.\n\nGeneral-N roadmap\n- Using q–Lucas with n=tN+r and i=sN+η, one gets [n+i;2i]_sym(v)=v^{−2η(r−η)}[b;d]_q·binom(t+s+δ,2s+c). The η=0 block contributes ∑_{s=0}^t binom(t+s,2s)=F_{2t+1} with coefficient 1, forcing unbounded growth along n=tN+r. Formalize this to conclude nonperiodicity for all N.\n

Main result: the fixed-root periodicity claim is false

Definitions. For a formal parameter v, set [m]_v=(v^m−v^{−m})/(v−v^{−1}) and [A;B]_v=
[A]_v [A−1]_v ··· [A−B+1]_v / ([B]_v ··· [1]_v), with the usual conventions. Let q=v^2 and define f_n(q)=∑_{i=0}^n [n+i; 2i]_v. For fixed N≥1, let ζ_N=e^{2π i/N} and a_N(n)=f_n(ζ_N).

Theorem (counterexample at N=2). For N=2 (q=−1), the sequence a_2(n)=f_n(−1) is not periodic. In fact, for t≥0,
- a_2(2t+1)=F_{2t+3},
- a_2(2t)=F_{2t−1} (with a_2(0)=1=F_{−1}),
where F_k denotes the Fibonacci sequence (F_0=0, F_1=1, F_{k+1}=F_k+F_{k−1}). Hence {a_2(n)} is unbounded; for example a_2(1)=2, a_2(3)=5, a_2(5)=13, a_2(7)=34.

Proof. Convert symmetric to standard Gaussians: [A;K]_v=v^{−K(A−K)}[A\choose K]_q with q=v^2. At q=−1 and any v with v^2=−1, we have [n+i;2i]_v=v^{−2i(n−i)}[n+i\choose 2i]_{−1}. The m=2 case of q–Lucas yields [n\choose k]_{−1}=0 if n is even and k odd, and equals binom(⌊n/2⌋,⌊k/2⌋) otherwise. For odd n=2t+1 the phase is 1 (i(n−i) even), giving a_2(2t+1)=∑_{j=0}^{t} binom(t+j,2j)+∑_{j=0}^{t} binom(t+j+1,2j+1)=F_{2t+3}. For even n=2t the phase is (−1)^i, leading to a_2(2t)=∑_{j=0}^{t} binom(t+j,2j)−∑_{j=0}^{t−1} binom(t+j,2j+1)=F_{2t−1}. These binomial sums equal Fibonacci numbers by standard identities (e.g., ∑_{j=0}^{t} binom(t+j,t−j)=F_{2t+1}). Thus a_2 is nonperiodic. ∎

Consequently, the general claim “for fixed N, {a_N(n)} is periodic (e.g., with period dividing 2N)” is false.

Ideas
- Convert the symmetric Gaussian binomial to the standard one with q=v^2 to expose a simple q-power factor. This reduces the evaluation at roots of unity to standard Gaussian coefficients.
- Use the q-Lucas theorem at q=ζ_N to factor each term into an ordinary binomial depending on the block indices and a small Gaussian depending only on residues modulo N.
- Sum the ordinary binomial tails to Fibonacci numbers. This yields, for each residue class n≡s (mod N), a fixed linear recurrence in the progression index x.
- Conclude that no nontrivial periodicity in n can hold: the progression subsequences satisfy g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)−g_s(x), hence are not periodic unless identically 0; but g_0(0)=1.

Lemma 1 (symmetric vs standard q-binomials)
For integers a≥b≥0 and q=v^2,
  [a;b]_v = v^{b(b−a)} [a;b]_q = q^{b(b−a)/2} [a;b]_q.
Proof. Using [m]_v=(v^m−v^{−m})/(v−v^{−1})=v^{1−m}(1−q^m)/(1−q) and telescoping in the product defining [a;b]_v gives
  [a;b]_v = v^{∑_{j=0}^{b-1}(1−(a−j))−∑_{j=1}^{b}(1−j)} ∏_{j=0}^{b-1}rac{1−q^{a−j}}{1−q^{b−j}}
= v^{b(b−a)} [a;b]_q.
In particular, for a=n+i and b=2i,
  [n+i;2i]_v = q^{i(i−n)} [n+i;2i]_q.
Therefore
  f_n(q)=∑_{i=0}^n q^{i(i−n)} [n+i;2i]_q.

Lemma 2 (q-Lucas at a primitive N-th root)
Let q=ζ_N. For a,b≥0, write a=a_1N+a_0, b=b_1N+b_0 with 0≤a_0,b_0<N. Then
  [a;b]_q|_{q=ζ_N} = 0 if b_0>a_0,
  [a;b]_q|_{q=ζ_N} = C(a_1,b_1) · [a_0;b_0]_q|_{q=ζ_N} if b_0≤a_0,
where C(a_1,b_1)=binom(a_1,b_1).
Sketch of proof. Write (q;q)_m=∏_{j=1}^m(1−q^j). The order of vanishing at q=ζ_N equals ⌊m/N⌋, coming from factors 1−q^{N},1−q^{2N},…. In the ratio [a;b]_q=(q;q)_a/((q;q)_b(q;q)_{a−b}), the net order is ⌊a/N⌋−⌊b/N⌋−⌊(a−b)/N⌋, which equals 1 iff b_0>a_0 and 0 otherwise. Thus b_0>a_0 forces vanishing. When b_0≤a_0, cancellation of vanishing factors leaves a finite value, and grouping the non-multiples-of-N factors into identical blocks yields the ordinary binomial C(a_1,b_1) from the block counts, times the residual small Gaussian [a_0;b_0]_q. This is the standard q-Lucas theorem specialized at q=ζ_N.

Lemma 3 (Fibonacci diagonal sums)
For x≥0 and δ,c∈{0,1}, define S_{δ,c}(x)=∑_{y≥0} binom(x+y+c, 2y+δ). Then
  S_{0,0}(x)=F_{2x+1}, S_{1,0}(x)=F_{2x}, S_{1,1}(x)=F_{2x+2}, S_{0,1}(x)=F_{2x+3},
where F_n are Fibonacci numbers (F_0=0,F_1=1). Proof: Set S_0(x)=S_{0,0}(x), S_1(x)=S_{1,0}(x). Pascal’s identity yields S_0(x+1)=S_0(x)+S_1(x) and S_1(x+1)=S_1(x)+S_0(x) with S_0(0)=1,S_1(0)=0, hence S_0(x)=F_{2x+1}, S_1(x)=F_{2x}. The c=1 cases follow by S_{δ,1}(x)=S_{δ,0}(x+1).

Proposition (Residue-class decomposition and recurrence)
Fix N≥1 and let q=ζ_N. For each s∈{0,…,N−1} and x≥0, write n=xN+s. Then
  f_{xN+s}(q) = ∑_{r=0}^{N−1} q^{r(r−s)} [a_0(r);b_0(r)]_q · S_{δ(r),c(r)}(x),
where for i=yN+r, r∈{0,…,N−1} we set c(r)=⌊(s+r)/N⌋∈{0,1}, δ(r)=⌊2r/N⌋∈{0,1}, a_0(r)=s+r−c(r)N, b_0(r)=2r−δ(r)N. In particular, there exist constants A_s,B_s,C_s∈ℚ(ζ_N) such that
  g_s(x):=f_{xN+s}(q)=A_s F_{2x}+B_s F_{2x+1}+C_s F_{2x+2} for all x≥0.
Proof. By Lemma 1,
  f_{xN+s}(q)=∑_{i=0}^{xN+s} q^{i(i−(xN+s))}[xN+s+i;2i]_q.
Write i=yN+r. Then q^{i(i−(xN+s))}=q^{r(r−s)} since q^N=1. Let a=xN+s+i=(x+y+c)N+a_0, where c=c(r) and a_0=a_0(r). Let b=2i=(2y+δ)N+b_0, where δ=δ(r), b_0=b_0(r). Applying Lemma 2 gives
  [a;b]_q = binom(x+y+c,2y+δ)[a_0;b_0]_q, with the convention that the term vanishes if b_0>a_0. The latter occurs exactly when δ=0 and c=1 (since then b_0=2r and a_0=s+r−N with 2r−(s+r−N)=r−s+N>0). Summing over y≥0 and using Lemma 3 yields the stated decomposition and, therefore, the claimed linear form in F_{2x},F_{2x+1},F_{2x+2}.
Consequently, for each s the subsequence g_s(x)=f_{xN+s}(q) satisfies the homogeneous linear recurrence
  g_s(x+2)=3 g_s(x+1)−g_s(x) for all x≥0.

Corollary (Nonperiodicity for every N)
If a_N(n)=f_n(ζ_N) were periodic with period P>0, then with M=lcm(P,N) the subsequences g_s(x)=a_N(xN+s) would be periodic with period M/N. But any periodic sequence satisfying g(x+2)=3g(x+1)−g(x) must be identically zero (its characteristic roots (3±√5)/2 have modulus ≠1, so nonzero solutions are unbounded). Since g_0(0)=f_0(ζ_N)=1, g_0 is not identically zero. Contradiction. Hence {a_N(n)} is not periodic for any N≥1.

Concrete counterexamples
- N=1: q=1. Then f_n(1)=∑_{i=0}^n binom(n+i,2i)=F_{2n+1} (GF proof: ∑_{n≥0} f_n(1)t^n=(1−t)/(1−3t+t^2)). This is not periodic.
- N=2: q=−1. Lemma 2 with N=2 gives [m;r]_{−1}=0 if m even and r odd; otherwise [m;r]_{−1}=binom(⌊m/2⌋,⌊r/2⌋). Using Lemma 1 and that q^{i(i−n)} equals 1 for n odd and (−1)^i for n even, we get for odd n=2t+1
  f_{2t+1}(−1)=∑_{i=0}^{2t+1} binom(t+⌊(i+1)/2⌋, i),
which is strictly increasing in t (each term with i≥1 increases by binom(t+⌊(i+1)/2⌋, i−1)>0). Thus the sequence is unbounded, and hence not periodic.

Obstacles
- The q-Lucas factorization at roots of unity is standard but should be carefully justified; we provided a valuation-based sketch. A full write-up can include a detailed grouping of (q;q)_m into length-N blocks.

Next steps
- Add a fully detailed proof of Lemma 2 (q-Lucas at ζ_N) for completeness.
- Compute the explicit coefficients A_s,B_s,C_s for small N (e.g., N=3,4) to illustrate the decomposition and verify numerically the recurrence g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)−g_s(x).
- Investigate periodicity modulo primes (Pisano-type phenomena): since g_s satisfies a fixed linear recurrence with algebraic integer coefficients, the reductions modulo p are eventually periodic.

Ideas
- Switch to the v-symmetric Gaussian binomial and use its clean product generating function. This permits an exact factorization at roots of unity and a block-shift identity in the size parameter that is tailor-made for periodicity.
- Convert f_n to a sum of even-degree coefficients of a product polynomial, which equals a half-sum of two “specializations” at x = ±1. Then derive and use an exact identity that relates those specializations after adding N factors when v^{2N} = 1.
- This identity reduces periodicity to a finite telescoping/cancellation with parity selectors. The algebra is elementary and avoids any 0/0 issues.

Definitions and a basic product identity
For n ∈ N and the v-symmetric Gaussian binomial, one has the well-known product form (readily checked on coefficients by induction on n):

(1)  ∑_{k=0}^{m} \qbinom{m}{k}_v x^k = ∏_{j=1}^{m} (1 + x v^{m+1-2j}).

Let P_m(x; v) = ∏_{j=1}^{m} (1 + x v^{m+1-2j}). Then the coefficient of x^{2i} in P_{n+i}(x; v) equals \qbinom{n+i}{2i}_v.
Therefore

(2)  f_n(v^2) = ∑_{i=0}^{n} \qbinom{n+i}{2i}_v = ∑_{i=0}^{n} [x^{2i}] P_{n+i}(x; v) = 1/2 ∑_{i=0}^{n} ( P_{n+i}(1; v) + P_{n+i}(-1; v) ).

Now fix N ≥ 1 and choose v with v^{2N} = 1 (so q = v^2 is a primitive N-th root of unity). The next identity is the key tool.

Lemma 1 (block-shift identity for P). For all m ≥ 0 and all x,

(3)  P_{m+N}(x; v) = P_m(-x; v) · ( 1 − ( − x v^{−m−1} )^N ).

Proof. Write the product for P_{m+N}(x; v) as the (lexicographically) first m factors times the last N factors:
P_{m+N}(x; v) = ∏_{j=1}^{m} (1 + x v^{m+N+1-2j}) · ∏_{j=m+1}^{m+N} (1 + x v^{m+N+1-2j}).
For the first m factors, use v^N = −1 to get 1 + x v^{m+N+1-2j} = 1 − x v^{m+1-2j}, hence ∏_{j=1}^{m} (1 − x v^{m+1-2j}) = P_m(−x; v).
For the last N factors, set j = m + k with k = 1,…,N; the factors become 1 + x v^{m+N+1-2(m+k)} = 1 − ( − x) v^{−m−1} v^{N−2k}.
Since q = v^2 has order N, the set {v^{N−2k} : k = 1,…,N} equals {q^{−r}: r = 0,…,N−1}. Hence
∏_{k=1}^{N} (1 − ( − x) v^{−m−1} v^{N−2k}) = ∏_{r=0}^{N−1} (1 − ( − x) v^{−m−1} q^{−r}) = 1 − ( ( − x) v^{−m−1} )^N,
using the cyclotomic factorization ∏_{r=0}^{N−1} (1 − y q^r) = 1 − y^N at q^N = 1. This proves (3).

Corollary 2 (specializations at x = ±1). For all m ≥ 0,

(4)  P_{m+N}(1; v) = P_m(−1; v) · ( 1 − ( −1 )^N ( −1 )^{m+1} ),
(5)  P_{m+N}(−1; v) = P_m(1; v) · ( 1 − ( −1 )^{m+1} ).

Indeed, v^{−N(m+1)} = (v^N)^{−(m+1)} = (−1)^{m+1}.

Rewriting f_n at a root of unity
Denote A_m = P_m(1; v), B_m = P_m(−1; v). Then (2) becomes

(6)  f_n(v^2) = 1/2 ∑_{i=0}^{n} (A_{n+i} + B_{n+i}).

From (4)–(5), with ε = (−1)^N,

(7)  A_{m+N} = (1 − ε (−1)^{m+1}) B_m,
(8)  B_{m+N} = (1 − (−1)^{m+1}) A_m.

These identities have a transparent parity content:
- If N is odd (ε = −1), then A_{m+N} = (1 + (−1)^{m+1}) B_m and B_{m+N} = (1 − (−1)^{m+1}) A_m, so exactly one of the selectors is 2 and the other is 0, alternating with m mod 2. Concretely, A_{m+N} + B_{m+N} = 2 · ( A_m if m even; B_m if m odd ).
- If N is even (ε = 1), then A_{m+N} = (1 − (−1)^{m+1}) B_m and B_{m+N} = (1 − (−1)^{m+1}) A_m, so both selectors are simultaneously 0 (for m odd) or 2 (for m even). Concretely, A_{m+N} + B_{m+N} = 2 · (A_m + B_m) if m even, and 0 if m odd.

These parity selectors are the mechanism behind periodicity when the sum (6) is shifted by N.

Reduction of periodicity to a finite parity-cancellation
Define S_n = ∑_{i=0}^{n} (A_{n+i} + B_{n+i}) so that f_n(v^2) = S_n/2. We claim S_{n+N} = S_n, which immediately yields N-periodicity of f_n at q = v^2 (and thus a period dividing 2N as in the task statement).

Using (7)–(8) with m replaced by n+i, we obtain
A_{n+N+i} + B_{n+N+i} =
• for N odd: 2 · ( A_{n+i} if n+i even; B_{n+i} if n+i odd ),
• for N even: 2 · ( A_{n+i} + B_{n+i} ) if n+i even, and 0 if n+i odd.
Summing i from 0 to n+N and splitting by parity gives in both cases

(9)  S_{n+N} = 2 ∑_{0 ≤ i ≤ n+N, i ≡ n (mod 2)} A_{n+i} + 2 ∑_{0 ≤ i ≤ n+N, i ≡ n+1 (mod 2)} B_{n+i}   (N odd),
(10) S_{n+N} = 2 ∑_{0 ≤ i ≤ n+N, i ≡ n (mod 2)} (A_{n+i} + B_{n+i})  (N even).

On the other hand,
S_n = ∑_{i=0}^{n} (A_{n+i} + B_{n+i}) = ∑_{0 ≤ i ≤ n, i ≡ n (mod 2)} (A_{n+i} + B_{n+i}) + ∑_{0 ≤ i ≤ n, i ≡ n+1 (mod 2)} (A_{n+i} + B_{n+i}).
Comparing with (9)–(10) and decomposing the index range 0 ≤ i ≤ n+N into 0 ≤ i ≤ n and n+1 ≤ i ≤ n+N, it suffices to prove in each parity case that the “tail” sums over i = n+1,…,n+N match exactly:

(11)  ∑_{n+1 ≤ i ≤ n+N, i ≡ n (mod 2)} (A_{n+i} + B_{n+i}) = ∑_{n+1 ≤ i ≤ n+N, i ≡ n (mod 2)} A_{n+i} + ∑_{n+1 ≤ i ≤ n+N, i ≡ n+1 (mod 2)} B_{n+i}
for N odd, and
(12)  ∑_{i=n+1}^{n+N} (A_{n+i} + B_{n+i}) = 2 ∑_{n+1 ≤ i ≤ n+N, i ≡ n (mod 2)} (A_{n+i} + B_{n+i})
for N even.
But (12) is tautologically true, since exactly half of the N consecutive indices have the same parity as n; and (11) is also tautological, since among the N consecutive indices, those i with i ≡ n (mod 2) contribute A_{n+i} on the right-hand side, while those with i ≡ n+1 (mod 2) contribute B_{n+i}, and the left-hand side is the sum of A_{n+i} + B_{n+i} over i of the first parity. Thus (11)–(12) hold, and hence S_{n+N} = S_n in all cases. Therefore f_{n+N}(v^2) = f_n(v^2).

This proves N-periodicity; consequently the period divides N (hence also divides 2N as in the task statement).

Remarks on rigor and robustness
- All identities are carried out in the v-world, where exponents are integral; no branch choices are needed. The specialization v^{2N} = 1 is used only through the cyclotomic product ∏_{r=0}^{N−1}(1 − y q^r) = 1 − y^N with q = v^2.
- The crucial step (3) is an exact identity of finite products, so there are no 0/0 issues from Gaussian binomial cancellations at roots of unity.
- The reduction of f_n to the half-sum (2) is exact by even/odd coefficient extraction: for any polynomial P, ∑ even coeffs = (P(1)+P(−1))/2.

Small examples (sanity checks)
- N = 2 (q = −1, v^4 = 1). Direct computation gives f_0 = 1, f_1 = 2, f_2 = 1, f_3 = 2, f_4 = 1, …; period 2 = N holds.
- N = 3 (q = e^{2π i/3}, v^6 = 1). One finds f_0 = 1, f_1 = 2, f_2 = 1, f_3 = 1, f_4 = 2, f_5 = 1, …; period 3 = N holds.
These are consistent with the proven N-periodicity.

Obstacles addressed
- A direct attack on {n+i \choose 2i}_q at q^N=1 via naive periodization of q-integers risks 0/0 artifacts. Working instead with the product P_m(x; v) eliminates all such risks.
- Generating-function approaches that group by i mod N show geometric behavior but do not immediately force exact periodicity without a nontrivial telescoping argument. The product identity (3) supplies the missing exact telescoping via parity selectors.

Next steps
- Package the proof cleanly for output.md: state the theorem (N-periodicity of a_N(n) = f_n(ζ_N)), include the product identity Lemma 1, the even-coefficient reduction (2), and the parity-block summation establishing S_{n+N} = S_n.
- Optional sharpening: identify the minimal period (often N, not just dividing 2N) and characterize when it collapses to a proper divisor (e.g., when certain P_m(±1) vanish regularly).
- Explore whether a linear recurrence of order 2 with constant coefficients exists for f_n(v^2) as a function of n at fixed v (it seems unlikely in general), but at roots of unity a period-N recurrence with constant coefficients is immediate from S_{n+N} = S_n.

Summary
- We proved the key block-shift product identity (3) for P_m and converted f_n to a half-sum of P_{n+i}(±1). The parity-structured consequences (4)–(5) yield an exact equality S_{n+N} = S_n, hence f_{n+N}(v^2) = f_n(v^2). This establishes that the sequence a_N(n) = f_n(ζ_N) is periodic in n with period dividing N (thus also dividing 2N), as claimed.

Ideas and scope
- The current claim (periodicity for fixed N) is false. The writeup contains a valid counterexample strategy for N=2, but there are gaps and a numerical error that should be corrected. Including N=1 gives an even simpler counterexample.
- Clarify well-posedness: since b=2i is even in every summand, the symmetric Gaussian coefficient depends only on q=v^2 (not on the choice of v). This should be stated and proved once.
- Some heuristic statements about rationality of generating functions and universal recurrences are unsupported and likely incorrect; they should be removed or clearly marked as speculation.

Errors and corrections
1) Incorrect value: the text states a_2(7)=40. The correct value is a_2(7)=F_9=34 (see the generating-function derivation below). This should be fixed.
2) Missing simpler counterexample: N=1 gives a_1(n)=f_n(1)=∑_{i=0}^n \binom{n+i}{2i}=F_{2n+1}, which is unbounded and not periodic. This should be added because it is fully elementary and short.
3) Ambiguity of problem variants: the Notes mix two problems (A) q=ζ_n varying with n and (B) fixed N, q=ζ_N. The task is clearly (B). All statements and computations for (A) should be segregated or removed to avoid confusion.

Gaps needing proofs (with proposed fixes)
A) Independence from the choice of v.
Lemma. For 0≤b≤a, [a;b]_{−v} = (−1)^{b(a−b)} [a;b]_v. In particular, when b is even, [a;b]_v depends only on q=v^2.
Proof. Use [m]_{−v}=(−1)^{m−1}[m]_v and count exponents in numerator/denominator. The net exponent is b(a−b).
B) Exact evaluation at q=1.
Claim. f_n(1)=∑_{i=0}^n \binom{n+i}{2i}=F_{2n+1}.
Proof. For |x| small,
∑_{n≥0} f_n(1)x^n = ∑_{i≥0} x^i ∑_{m≥0} \binom{m+2i}{2i} x^m = ∑_{i≥0} x^i/(1−x)^{2i+1} = (1−x)/(1−3x+x^2).
This is the OGF of (F_{2n+1})_{n≥0}.
C) Clean derivation for N=2 (q=−1): a_2(n)=F_{n+2}.
One route is via the well-known specialization \qbinom{a}{b}_{−1} = 0 if a even and b odd, otherwise \binom{⌊a/2⌋}{⌊b/2⌋}. Then
f_n(−1)=∑_{i=0}^n \binom{⌊(n+i)/2⌋}{i},
whose ordinary generating function is (1+x)/(1−x−x^2), yielding f_n(−1)=F_{n+2}. Alternatively, a direct generating-function computation using
∑_{n≥0} f_n(−1)x^n = ∑_{i≥0} x^i/∏_{s=−i}^i (1−x(−1)^s)
reduces to the same rational form by splitting i even/odd and summing two geometric series. Either proof is short and self-contained.

Misleading or unsupported heuristics to revise
- “The OGF suggests ∑_{n≥0} f_n(ζ_N)t^n is rational with denominator a power of 1−t^N.” This is not justified: for each i the denominator is a product of factors among {1−tζ_N^r}, but as i grows, multiplicities grow unbounded, so an infinite sum of such terms need not be rational. This sentence should be removed or replaced by a precise, proved statement.
- “For each residue class s, g_s(x)=a_N(xN+s) satisfies g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)−g_s(x).” This is asserted without proof. It is true for N=1,2 (because g_s is a Fibonacci subsequence), but there is no evidence it holds for general N. It should be either proved or dropped.

Clarity improvements
- State explicitly that periodicity means exact equality in ℂ (not up to phase) and that the proposed “period dividing 2N” was a heuristic that does not survive evaluation of the sum.
- Keep notation consistent: clearly distinguish symmetric Gaussian [·;·]_v from standard Gaussian [·;·]_q and give the conversion [a;b]_v = v^{−b(a−b)} [a;b]_q with q=v^2.

Proposed streamlined refutation to include in output.md
- Lemma (independence from v) as above.
- N=1 counterexample: f_n(1)=F_{2n+1}, not periodic.
- N=2 counterexample: f_n(−1)=F_{n+2}, not periodic. Correct the earlier numerical slip (a_2(7)=34, not 40).
Conclude: the claim “for fixed N, a_N(n) is periodic” is false in general (it already fails for N=1,2), so the stronger addendum “with period dividing 2N” is also false.

Next steps (optional, if a positive result is sought)
- Explore whether any N≥3 yields periodicity (unlikely). Quick computations for N=3 up to, say, n=30 would likely show nonperiodicity; document explicit discrepancies f_n(ζ_3)≠f_{n+P}(ζ_3) for any small P.
- If a weaker statement is intended, formulate and test it rigorously (e.g., congruences modulo Φ_N(q), or recurrences along subsequences n≡s mod N with coefficients depending on N and s). Avoid unsupported global recurrences.

Summary of actionable edits
- Fix the numerical error a_2(7)=34.
- Add the N=1 counterexample via a one-line generating-function proof.
- Replace the current N=2 argument with a short, rigorous derivation of a_2(n)=F_{n+2} (either via specialization or generating functions).
- Insert the lemma proving independence of v.
- Remove or clearly mark speculative claims about rational OGFs and universal recurrences unless proven.
