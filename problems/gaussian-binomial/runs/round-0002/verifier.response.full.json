The conversion from symmetric to standard Gaussians is correct, and the use of q-Lucas at q = \u03b6_N is appropriate. The residue-class decomposition is sound, and the diagonal-sum identities yielding Fibonacci numbers are correct. The conclusion that for each residue s the subsequence g_s(x) = a_N(xN + s) satisfies g_s(x+2) = 3 g_s(x+1) \u2212 g_s(x) is compelling and, together with g_0(0) = 1, obstructs any 2N-period.

Identity (3) fails in general (e.g., N = 3, m = 0 gives a sign mismatch), and the subsequent \u201csanity checks\u201d (claiming period N for N = 2) contradict direct computation (a_2(3) = 5 \u2260 2).

This path should be abandoned or corrected.\\n\\nProver 3: The invariance under v \u21a6 \u2212v for even lower index b is correct and useful.
