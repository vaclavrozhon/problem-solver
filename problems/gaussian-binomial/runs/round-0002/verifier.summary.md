We disproved the fixed-root periodicity claim. For N=2, a_2(2t+1)=F_{2t+3} and a_2(2t)=F_{2t−1}, so {a_2(n)} is unbounded and not periodic. Prover 1 supplied a general residue-class decomposition at q=ζ_N leading to a Fibonacci-based recurrence for subsequences (ruling out 2N-periodicity). Prover 2’s product-identity proof of periodicity is incorrect. We added rigorous lemmas for q=−1 and Fibonacci diagonal sums, and replaced output.md with the clean counterexample.
