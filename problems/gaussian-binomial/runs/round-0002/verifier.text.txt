  "feedback_md": "Overall status: The fixed-N claim is false. The Current Output provides a correct, self-contained counterexample for N=2 (q = −1), with explicit formulas a_2(2t+1) = F_{2t+3} and a_2(2t) = F_{2t−1}. This alone disproves periodicity for fixed N. One earlier numerical slip a_2(7) = 40 should be corrected to 34; the corrected Output already reflects this.\n\nProver 1: Strong and relevant. The conversion from symmetric to standard Gaussians is correct, and the use of q-Lucas at q = ζ_N is appropriate. The residue-class decomposition is sound, and the diagonal-sum identities yielding Fibonacci numbers are correct. The conclusion that for each residue s the subsequence g_s(x) = a_N(xN + s) satisfies g_s(x+2) = 3 g_s(x+1) − g_s(x) is compelling and, together with g_0(0) = 1, obstructs any 2N-period. Minor: please write out the q-Lucas-at-root-of-unity lemma in full detail (you gave a valuation sketch) and explicitly mention why the case (δ = 0, c = 1) vanishes (b_0 > a_0).\n\nProver 2: The product identity approach is attractive but incorrect as stated. Identity (3) fails in general (e.g., N = 3, m = 0 gives a sign mismatch), and the subsequent “sanity checks” (claiming period N for N = 2) contradict direct computation (a_2(3) = 5 ≠ 2). The set substitution {v^{N−2k}} = {q^{−r}} is invalid when N is odd (one factor is v^{−N} = −1, not a power of q). This path should be abandoned or corrected.\n\nProver 3: The invariance under v ↦ −v for even lower index b is correct and useful. However, the claimed a_2(n) = F_{n+2} is false (it ignores the q^{i(i−n)} twist). The corrected formulas in the Current Output are right; please update your derivation accordingly.\n\nNext steps: (i) Record a complete proof of the q-Lucas specialization at q = ζ_N to support Prover 1’s decomposition. (ii) Add the short proof of the Fibonacci diagonal sums (now included). (iii) Optionally compute the coefficients A_s, B_s, C_s for small N to showcase nonperiodicity and growth. (iv) If desired, study periodicity modulo primes using the fixed second-order recurrence for each residue subsequence.",

    "content": "Lemma (symmetrized-to-standard conversion). For integers a≥b≥0 and q=v^2,\n  [a;b]_v = v^{b(b−a)} [a;b]_q.\nProof. Using [m]_v=(v^m−v^{−m})/(v−v^{−1})=v^{1−m}(1−q^m)/(1−q) and telescoping exponents in the product yields v^{∑_{j=0}^{b−1}(1−(a−j))−∑_{j=0}^{b−1}(1−(b−j))}=v^{b(b−a)}.\n\nLemma (evaluation of standard Gaussians at q=−1). For n≥0 and 0≤k≤n,\n- If n is even and k is odd, then [n;k]_q|_{q=−1}=0.\n- Otherwise, [n;k]_q|_{q=−1}=C(⌊n/2⌋, ⌊k/2⌋).\nProof. Let H(n,k)=[n;k]_q. The q-Pascal recursion H(n,k)=H(n−1,k)+q^{n−k}H(n−1,k−1) with H(n,0)=H(n,n)=1, evaluated at q=−1, gives the parity split. Induction on n yields the two cases as in the analysis: for n odd, H(2t+1,k)=C(t,⌊k/2⌋); for n even, H(2t,k)=0 if k odd and H(2t,k)=C(t,k/2) if k even.\n\nLemma (Fibonacci diagonal sums). For x≥0,\n  S_0(x):=∑_{y≥0} C(x+y, 2y) = F_{2x+1},\n  S_1(x):=∑_{y≥0} C(x+y, 2y+1) = F_{2x}.\nProof. Define S_0(x), S_1(x) for x≥0 with S_0(0)=1, S_1(0)=0. Pascal’s identity C(x+1+y, m)=C(x+y, m)+C(x+y, m−1) implies S_0(x+1)=S_0(x)+S_1(x) and S_1(x+1)=S_1(x)+S_0(x). Thus (S_0,S_1) follows the Fibonacci companion recurrence, yielding S_0(x)=F_{2x+1}, S_1(x)=F_{2x}.\n\nProposition (N=2 counterexample: nonperiodicity). Let ζ_2=−1 and define a_2(n)=f_n(−1)=∑_{i=0}^n [n+i;2i]_v|_{v^2=−1}. Then {a_2(n)} is not periodic; specifically, for t≥0,\n  a_2(2t+1)=F_{2t+3},\n  a_2(2t)=F_{2t−1} (with a_2(0)=1=F_{−1}).\nProof. By the conversion lemma,\n  [n+i;2i]_v|_{v^2=−1} = (−1)^{i(i−n)} [n+i;2i]_q|_{q=−1}.\nFor n odd, n=2t+1, i(i−n) is even, so the sign is +1, and 2i is even. By the q=−1 lemma,\n  [n+i;2i]_{−1} = C(⌊(2t+1+i)/2⌋, i) = C(t+⌊(i+1)/2⌋, i).\nPartitioning i by parity gives\n  a_2(2t+1)=∑_{j=0}^t C(t+j, 2j) + ∑_{j=0}^t C(t+j+1, 2j+1) = S_0(t) + S_1(t+1) = F_{2t+1} + F_{2t+2} = F_{2t+3}.\nFor n even, n=2t, the sign is (−1)^i. Using the q=−1 lemma and splitting parity yields\n  a_2(2t)=∑_{j=0}^t C(t+j, 2j) − ∑_{j=0}^{t−1} C(t+j, 2j+1) = S_0(t) − S_1(t) = F_{2t+1} − F_{2t} = F_{2t−1}.\nHence the sequence is unbounded and not periodic. ∎"

Therefore a_2 is not periodic, and the general claim of periodicity (e.g., with period dividing 2N) is false. ∎"
