Ideas
- Convert the symmetric Gaussian to the standard Gaussian with q=v^2, isolating a simple q-power factor. Then specialize at q=ζ_N.
- Apply q–Lucas at a primitive N-th root to split each term into an ordinary binomial (block index) times a small Gaussian (residue). Summing the ordinary binomial tails gives Fibonacci numbers.
- For each residue s (n=xN+s), obtain g_s(x)=a_N(xN+s) as a fixed linear combination of F_{2x}, F_{2x+1}, F_{2x+2}; hence g_s satisfies g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)−g_s(x). Nontrivial solutions are not periodic.

Reduction to standard Gaussians
For integers a≥b≥0 and q=v^2,
  \[\qbinom{a}{b}_v = v^{b(b−a)}\,[a;b]_q = q^{\frac{b(b−a)}2}\,[a;b]_q.\]
Hence
  \[f_n(q)=\sum_{i=0}^n q^{i(i−n)}\,[n+i;2i]_q.\]
At q=ζ_N and i=yN+r, n=xN+s (0≤r,s<N), we have q^{i(i−n)}=q^{r(r−s)}.

q–Lucas at q=ζ_N (precise statement and proof)
Write a=a_1N+a_0, b=b_1N+b_0 with 0≤a_0,b_0<N. Then at q=ζ_N,
  [a;b]_q=0 if b_0>a_0, and [a;b]_q=\binom{a_1}{b_1}\,[a_0;b_0]_q if b_0≤a_0.
Proof. Using (q;q)_m=∏_{j=1}^m(1−q^j) and the factorization
  (q;q)_m=∏_{r=0}^{N−1}(q^{r+1};q^N)_{\lfloor\frac{m−r}{N}\rfloor},
we get
  [a;b]_q=\prod_{r=0}^{N−1}\frac{(q^{r+1};q^N)_{\lfloor\frac{a−r}{N}\rfloor}}{(q^{r+1};q^N)_{\lfloor\frac{b−r}{N}\rfloor}(q^{r+1};q^N)_{\lfloor\frac{a−b−r}{N}\rfloor}}.
For r=0, the quotient tends to \frac{(q^N;q^N)_{a_1}}{(q^N;q^N)_{b_1}(q^N;q^N)_{a_1−b_1−c}}, where c=1 if a_0<b_0 and c=0 otherwise. Thus it is 0 iff a_0<b_0; if a_0≥b_0 it equals [a_1;b_1]_{q^N}, which at q^N=1 is \binom{a_1}{b_1}. For r∈{1,…,N−1}, one checks that the quotient equals (q^{r+1};q^N)_{ε_r}/(q^{r+1};q^N)_{δ_r} with ε_r−δ_r∈{0,1}, and the product over r>0 simplifies to [a_0;b_0]_q. Combining yields the stated formula.

Fibonacci diagonal sums
For x≥0 and δ,c∈{0,1}, define S_{δ,c}(x)=∑_{y≥0}\binom{x+y+c}{2y+δ}. Then
  S_{0,0}(x)=F_{2x+1}, S_{1,0}(x)=F_{2x}, S_{1,1}(x)=F_{2x+2}, S_{0,1}(x)=F_{2x+3}.
Proof: Induction via Pascal’s identity; note S_{δ,1}(x)=S_{δ,0}(x+1).

Residue-class decomposition and recurrence
Fix N and q=ζ_N. Let n=xN+s. With i=yN+r and
  c=\lfloor\tfrac{s+r}{N}\rfloor, δ=\lfloor\tfrac{2r}{N}\rfloor, a_0=s+r−cN, b_0=2r−δN,
q–Lucas gives
  [n+i;2i]_q=\binom{x+y+c}{2y+δ}\,[a_0;b_0]_q, with the term vanishing iff b_0>a_0 (which holds in particular for δ=0,c=1). Therefore
  g_s(x):=f_{xN+s}(q)=\sum_{r=0}^{N−1} q^{r(r−s)}\,[a_0(r);b_0(r)]_q\,S_{δ(r),c(r)}(x).
Equivalently, there exist constants A_s,B_s,C_s∈ℚ(ζ_N) such that
  g_s(x)=A_s F_{2x}+B_s F_{2x+1}+C_s F_{2x+2}.
Hence, for each s,
  g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)−g_s(x) for all x≥0.

Nonperiodicity
If {a_N(n)} were periodic (any period P>0), then for each residue s, g_s(x)=a_N(xN+s) would be periodic with period M/N where M=lcm(P,N). A nonzero sequence obeying g(x+2)=3g(x+1)−g(x) cannot be periodic (characteristic roots (3±√5)/2 have |·|≠1). Since g_0(0)=f_0(ζ_N)=1, g_0 is nonzero. Contradiction. Thus the claim is false for every N≥1.

Explicit examples (verifiable)
- N=3. For s=0,1,2 one finds
  a_3(3x)=F_{2x+1}−F_{2x}=F_{2x−1}, a_3(3x+1)=2F_{2x+1}, a_3(3x+2)=F_{2x+3}.
- N=4. For s=0,1,2,3 one finds
  a_4(4x)=F_{2x+1}, a_4(4x+1)=2F_{2x+1}−F_{2x}, a_4(4x+2)=2F_{2x+1}+F_{2x+2}, a_4(4x+3)=F_{2x+1}.
These satisfy g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)−g_s(x) and are plainly nonperiodic.

Notes on vanishing case (δ=0,c=1)
Here 2r<N and s+r≥N, so b_0=2r and a_0=s+r−N. Then b_0−a_0=r−s+N>0, hence b_0>a_0, and the term vanishes by q–Lucas.

Obstacles
- A fully detailed proof of the r>0 factor in q–Lucas (grouping via (q^{r+1};q^N)-Pochhammers) is straightforward but notationally heavy; we sketched the standard reduction.

Next steps
- Write the full q–Lucas-at-ζ_N proof using (q^{r+1};q^N)-factorization; add to proofs.md.
- Record the residue/Fibonacci decomposition and the recurrence as a theorem in output.md.
- Compute A_s,B_s,C_s for small N (we provided N=3,4) and verify numerically for initial x.
- Optional: study reductions modulo primes; each g_s satisfies a constant-coefficient recurrence, hence is eventually periodic modulo p (Pisano-type behavior).
