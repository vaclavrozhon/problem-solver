The correct structure is the q-Lucas factorization above.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Compute C_N explicitly for small N to illustrate the linear form f_{xN}(\u03b6) = F_{2x+1} + C_N F_{2x}.\\n- Extend the decomposition to all residue classes s (n = xN + s), yielding explicit constants A_s, B_s with f_{xN+s}(\u03b6) = A_s F_{2x+1} + B_s F_{2x} + possibly C_s F_{2x+2} when (\u03b4, c) = (1,1) occurs. This furnishes a uniform nonperiodicity proof for every s.\\n- Investigate reductions modulo primes (Pisano-type periodicity) using the second-order recurrence satisfied by each residue subsequence.\\n\\nSummary\\n- The q-Lucas specialization (3) at q = \u03b6_N is established via product grouping and a first-order cancellation at multiples of N, yielding an ordinary binomial factor \\\\binom{a}{c}.\\n- For n = xN, only the r = 0 block (\u03b4 = 0) and the blocks with r \u2265 \u2308N/2\u2309 (\u03b4 = 1) contribute, giving the exact formula f_{xN}(\u03b6) = F_{2x+1} + C_N F_{2x}.
