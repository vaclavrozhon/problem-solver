Ideas
- Prove a q-Lucas specialization at a primitive N-th root of unity ζ_N for Gaussian binomials. This is the main structural tool that reduces indices modulo N and isolates an ordinary binomial factor.
- Apply it to f_{xN}(ζ_N) along the subsequence n = xN. The r = 0 residue block alone produces a Fibonacci diagonal sum F_{2x+1}. The remaining residue blocks contribute a fixed constant times F_{2x}. Hence f_{xN}(ζ_N) = F_{2x+1} + C_N F_{2x} for an explicit constant C_N ∈ Q(ζ_N). This proves unbounded growth and nonperiodicity for any fixed N.

Symmetric-to-standard conversion
For q = v^2 and a ≥ b ≥ 0, the symmetric Gaussian equals the standard Gaussian times a power of v:

(1)  \qbinom{a}{b}_v = v^{b(b−a)} \binom{a}{b}_q.

Hence

(2)  f_n(q) = ∑_{i=0}^{n} q^{i(i−n)} \binom{n+i}{2i}_q,

where \binom{•}{•}_q denotes the standard Gaussian polynomial in q.

q-Lucas at roots of unity
Proposition (q-Lucas at ζ_N). Fix N ≥ 1 and let ζ = ζ_N be a primitive N-th root of unity. Write n = aN + b and k = cN + d with 0 ≤ b, d < N and a, c ≥ 0. Then

(3)  \binom{n}{k}_q\big|_{q=ζ} = \begin{cases} \binom{a}{c}\, \binom{b}{d}_q\big|_{q=ζ}, & d ≤ b,\\ 0, & d > b. \end{cases}

Proof. The standard Gaussian has the product form

\binom{n}{k}_q = ∏_{j=1}^{k} \frac{1 − q^{n−k+j}}{1 − q^{j}}.

We evaluate at q = ζ via a limiting argument (the result equals the limit since the left-hand side is a polynomial in q). Let q approach ζ radially so q^N → 1. Group the factors by j modulo N.
- For residue classes r ∈ {1,…,N−1} (i.e., j ≡ r mod N), the denominators 1 − q^{j} stay away from 0 as q → ζ. Using q^N → 1, all such blocks converge to the same ratios one would get by replacing q^{tN+r} with q^{r}, producing exactly the factor \binom{b}{d}_q|_{q=ζ} provided d ≤ b; if d > b there are more denominator than numerator factors with the same residue, forcing zero in the limit.
- For the residue class r ≡ 0 (multiples of N), write the j’s as j = tN (1 ≤ t ≤ c) in the denominator and j′ = n − k + j = (a − c + t)N + (b − d) in the numerator. The unique vanishing factor in each N-block occurs at exponents multiple of N; its first-order behavior is 1 − q^{tN} ≈ −t(q^N − 1). Hence

∏_{t=1}^{c} (1 − q^{tN}) in the denominator and ∏_{t=1}^{a−c} (1 − q^{tN}) in the remaining denominator (from (n − k)-block) jointly cancel all but the numerator ∏_{t=1}^{a} (1 − q^{tN}). Taking the ratio of these 0/0 products as q → ζ gives

\frac{∏_{t=1}^{a} t}{(∏_{t=1}^{c} t)(∏_{t=1}^{a−c} t)} = \binom{a}{c}.

Multiplying the nonzero-residue contribution with this yields (3). ∎

Two diagonal binomial sums
For x ≥ 0,

(4)  ∑_{y=0}^{x} \binom{x+y}{2y} = F_{2x+1},

(5)  ∑_{y=0}^{x-1} \binom{x+y}{2y+1} = F_{2x},

where F_n is the Fibonacci sequence (F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1). A concise proof uses generating functions: set S(x) = ∑_{y=0}^{x} \binom{x+y}{2y}, T(x) = ∑_{y=0}^{x-1} \binom{x+y}{2y+1}. Then

∑_{x≥0} S(x) t^x = ∑_{y≥0} t^y \sum_{m≥0} \binom{m+2y}{2y} t^m = ∑_{y≥0} \frac{t^y}{(1−t)^{2y+1}} = \frac{1−t}{1 − 3t + t^2},

∑_{x≥0} T(x) t^x = ∑_{y≥0} t^{y+1} \sum_{m≥0} \binom{m+2y+1}{2y+1} t^m = \frac{t}{1 − 3t + t^2}.

These are the OGFs of F_{2x+1} and F_{2x}, respectively.

Nonperiodicity for fixed N via the subsequence n = xN
Theorem. For any fixed N ≥ 1 and ζ = ζ_N, define a_N(n) = f_n(ζ). For x ≥ 1,

(6)  f_{xN}(ζ) = F_{2x+1} + C_N F_{2x},

with

(7)  C_N = ∑_{r=\lceil N/2\rceil}^{N−1} ζ^{r^2} \binom{r}{2r−N}_q\Big|_{q=ζ} ∈ \mathbb{Q}(ζ).

In particular, the subsequence {f_{xN}(ζ)}_{x≥0} is unbounded, so {a_N(n)} is not periodic.

Proof. Start from (2) with n = xN:

f_{xN}(ζ) = ∑_{i=0}^{xN} ζ^{i(i−xN)} \binom{xN+i}{2i}_q\Big|_{q=ζ}.

Write i = yN + r with 0 ≤ r ≤ N−1 and y ≥ 0. Then ζ^{i(i−xN)} = ζ^{r^2}. Apply q-Lucas (3) with a = x + y, b = r, c = 2y, d = 2r, so δ := ⌊2r/N⌋ ∈ {0,1} and

\binom{xN + yN + r}{2yN + 2r}_q\Big|_{q=ζ} = \binom{x+y}{2y + δ} ⋅ \binom{r}{2r − δN}_q\Big|_{q=ζ}.

Because r < N, c = ⌊(0 + r)/N⌋ = 0, so only δ matters. If δ = 0 (i.e., 2r < N), then \binom{r}{2r}_q vanishes unless r = 0. Thus the only δ = 0 contribution is r = 0, giving

∑_{y=0}^{x} \binom{x+y}{2y} = F_{2x+1}.

If δ = 1 (i.e., r ≥ ⌈N/2⌉), then the admissible y satisfy y ≤ ⌊(xN − r)/N⌋ = x − 1, and we get

∑_{y=0}^{x−1} \binom{x+y}{2y+1} = F_{2x},

multiplied by the constant factor ζ^{r^2} \binom{r}{2r−N}_q|_{q=ζ}. Summing over r yields (6)–(7). Since F_{2x+1} grows strictly with x and appears with coefficient 1, the subsequence f_{xN}(ζ) is unbounded, proving nonperiodicity. ∎

Examples
- N = 1: C_1 = 0, so f_{x}(1) = F_{2x+1}. Nonperiodic.
- N = 2: r runs over {1}, so C_2 = ζ_2^{1} \binom{1}{0}_q|_{q=−1} = −1 and f_{2x}(−1) = F_{2x+1} − F_{2x} = F_{2x−1} (x ≥ 1), agreeing with the explicit formulas a_2(2t) = F_{2t−1}, a_2(2t+1) = F_{2t+3}.

Obstacles and corrections
- A previous product-identity approach asserting periodicity failed; exact block identities with x = ±1 specializations do not hold in general and contradict explicit N = 2 values. The correct structure is the q-Lucas factorization above.

Next steps
- Compute C_N explicitly for small N to illustrate the linear form f_{xN}(ζ) = F_{2x+1} + C_N F_{2x}.
- Extend the decomposition to all residue classes s (n = xN + s), yielding explicit constants A_s, B_s with f_{xN+s}(ζ) = A_s F_{2x+1} + B_s F_{2x} + possibly C_s F_{2x+2} when (δ, c) = (1,1) occurs. This furnishes a uniform nonperiodicity proof for every s.
- Investigate reductions modulo primes (Pisano-type periodicity) using the second-order recurrence satisfied by each residue subsequence.

Summary
- The q-Lucas specialization (3) at q = ζ_N is established via product grouping and a first-order cancellation at multiples of N, yielding an ordinary binomial factor \binom{a}{c}.
- For n = xN, only the r = 0 block (δ = 0) and the blocks with r ≥ ⌈N/2⌉ (δ = 1) contribute, giving the exact formula f_{xN}(ζ) = F_{2x+1} + C_N F_{2x}. The subsequence is unbounded, hence the fixed-root periodicity claim is false for every N ≥ 1.
