This can be strengthened to a uniform disproof for all N by analyzing the subsequence n=xN (i.e., residue class s=0) via q\u2013Lucas at q=\u03b6_N.\\n- Clarify well-posedness: since the lower index is 2i (even), each summand depends only on q=v^2 (not the choice of v). This should be explicitly proved once and used.\\n- Remove or clearly label unsupported heuristics (e.g., OGF rationality leading to period N). They are not justified and contradict the actual behavior.\\n\\nCorrections and clarity\\n- Fix a numerical error in prior notes: f_3(\u03b6_3)=1, not 3+\u03b6_3. A direct computation using standard Gaussians shows [4;2]_{\u03b6_3}=0 and [5;4]_{\u03b6_3}=1+\u03b6_3+\u03b6_3^2+\u03b6_3^3+\u03b6_3^4, together yielding f_3(\u03b6_3)=3+2\u03b6_3+2\u03b6_3^2=1.\\n- Add the simple N=1 counterexample: f_n(1)=\u2211_{i=0}^n C(n+i,2i)=F_{2n+1}, hence nonperiodic.\\n\\nRigorous additions: two lemmas\\n1) Independence from the square root.\\nLemma. For 0\u2264b\u2264a, we have [a;b]_{\u2212v}=(\u22121)^{b(a\u2212b)}[a;b]_v. In particular, when b is even, [a;b]_v depends only on q=v^2.\\nProof. Since [m]_{\u2212v}=(\u22121)^{m\u22121}[m]_v, multiplying exponents across numerator and denominator gives the net factor (\u22121)^{b(a\u2212b)}.\\n2) Symmetric\u2013standard conversion. With q=v^2, [a;b]_v=v^{b(b\u2212a)} [a;b]_q. This justifies switching to standard Gaussian polynomials for evaluation at roots of unity.\\n\\nUniform nonperiodicity for all N (new, to add to output.md)\\nProposition. For any fixed N\u22651, define g(x):=a_N(xN)=f_{xN}(\u03b6_N). Then for some constant C_N\u2208\u2102 (explicitly computable from N),\\n- g(x)=F_{2x+1}+C_N F_{2x} for all x\u22650,\\n- hence g satisfies g(x+2)=3g(x+1)\u2212g(x) with g(0)=1 and is not periodic. Consequently, {a_N(n)} is not periodic in n for any N.\\nProof. Write n=xN and split i=yN+r with y\u22650 and 0\u2264r\u2264N\u22121. Using [a;b]_v=v^{b(b\u2212a)}[a;b]_q and q=\u03b6_N,\\n[n+i;2i]_v = \u03b6_N^{r(r\u22120)}\u00b7[xN+s; 2yN+\u03b4]_q\u00b7[a_0;b_0]_q|_{q=\u03b6_N},\\nwith c=\u230a(0+r)/N\u230b, \u03b4=\u230a2r/N\u230b, a_0=0+r\u2212cN, b_0=2r\u2212\u03b4N. Only the following residue blocks contribute:\\n- r=0: then c=\u03b4=0, a_0=b_0=0 and [a_0;b_0]=1. The y bounds are 0\u2264y\u2264x. The contribution sums to \u2211_{y=0}^x C(x+y,2y)=F_{2x+1}.\\n- r with N/2\u2264r\u2264N\u22121: then \u03b4=1 and c=0 (since 0+r<N). The remainder [a_0;b_0]=[r;2r\u2212N]_{\u03b6_N} is nonzero (as 2r\u2212N\u2264r), and y runs 0\u2264y\u2264x\u22121 (because r>0). These contribute constants w_r:=\u03b6_N^{r^2}[r;2r\u2212N]_{\u03b6_N} times \u2211_{y=0}^{x\u22121} C(x+y,2y+1)=F_{2x}.\\nAll other residues give zero: if 0<r<N/2, then \u03b4=0 but b_0=2r>a_0=r (since s=0), so [a_0;b_0]=0; the case c=1,\u03b4=1 cannot occur for s=0. Summing over r yields g(x)=F_{2x+1}+C_N F_{2x} with C_N=\u2211_{r=\\big\\u0015N/2\\u0017}^{N\u22121} \u03b6_N^{r^2} [r;2r\u2212N]_{\u03b6_N}.\\nSince F_{2x} and F_{2x+1} satisfy H(x+2)=3H(x+1)\u2212H(x), so does g. As g(0)=a_N(0)=1, g is not identically zero, and the only periodic solution to the recurrence is the zero sequence (characteristic roots (3\u00b1\u221a5)/2 are not on the unit circle). Therefore g cannot be periodic, and neither can the full sequence {a_N(n)} (any global period would force periodicity on the s=0 subsequence).\\nExample checks. N=2: C_2=\u03b6_2^{1}[1;0]_{\u22121}=\u22121, so g(x)=F_{2x+1}\u2212F_{2x}=F_{2x\u22121} (agrees with a_2(2t)=F_{2t\u22121}). N=3: C_3=\u03b6_3^{4}[2;1]_{\u03b6_3}=\u03b6_3(1+\u03b6_3)=\u03b6_3+\u03b6_3^2=\u22121, hence g(x)=F_{2x+1}\u2212F_{2x}, yielding g(1)=1 as computed above.\\n\\nImplications for the writeup\\n- Strengthen the main disproof: add the uniform Proposition above. This removes reliance on N=1,2 and explains the structural reason for nonperiodicity.\\n- Add the independence-from-v lemma at the start of proofs.md (ensures f_n is a function of q when the lower index is even).\\n- Correct the erroneous numerical claim f_3(\u03b6_3)=3+\u03b6_3 and replace it with f_3(\u03b6_3)=1 (include the short calculation or derive via the Proposition).\\n- Remove the OGF-based \u201cperiod N\u201d heuristic; it is unsupported and contradicted by the recurrence for g.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Optional: compute C_N for small N (e.g., C_2=\u22121, C_3=\u22121, C_4=0) to illustrate diversity and to check the Proposition numerically.\\n- If desired, generalize the residue-class analysis to arbitrary s to express a_N(xN+s) as a fixed linear combination of F_{2x},F_{2x+1},F_{2x+2} with coefficients in \u211a(\u03b6_N). This yields the same second-order recurrence for each residue class.\\n- Explore reductions modulo primes (Pisano-type periodicity) for these recurrences, which is a plausible positive replacement statement.\\n\\nReferences for tools\\n- q\u2013Lucas at roots of unity: for X=am+b, Y=cm+d with 0\u2264b,d<m, [X;Y]_q|_{q=\u03b6_m}=C(a,c)\u00b7[b;d]_q|_{q=\u03b6_m}, where C(a,c)=C(a,c)=\\\\binom{a}{c} (standard). A short proof via the factorization of q-factorials modulo \u03a6_m(q) can be added to proofs.md.\\n- Fibonacci diagonal sums: \u2211_{y=0}^x C(x+y,2y)=F_{2x+1} and \u2211_{y=0}^{x\u22121} C(x+y,2y+1)=F_{2x}.
