Ideas and scope
- The fixed-root periodicity claim is false. The current writeup gives a correct and clean disproof for N=2. This can be strengthened to a uniform disproof for all N by analyzing the subsequence n=xN (i.e., residue class s=0) via q–Lucas at q=ζ_N.
- Clarify well-posedness: since the lower index is 2i (even), each summand depends only on q=v^2 (not the choice of v). This should be explicitly proved once and used.
- Remove or clearly label unsupported heuristics (e.g., OGF rationality leading to period N). They are not justified and contradict the actual behavior.

Corrections and clarity
- Fix a numerical error in prior notes: f_3(ζ_3)=1, not 3+ζ_3. A direct computation using standard Gaussians shows [4;2]_{ζ_3}=0 and [5;4]_{ζ_3}=1+ζ_3+ζ_3^2+ζ_3^3+ζ_3^4, together yielding f_3(ζ_3)=3+2ζ_3+2ζ_3^2=1.
- Add the simple N=1 counterexample: f_n(1)=∑_{i=0}^n C(n+i,2i)=F_{2n+1}, hence nonperiodic.

Rigorous additions: two lemmas
1) Independence from the square root.
Lemma. For 0≤b≤a, we have [a;b]_{−v}=(−1)^{b(a−b)}[a;b]_v. In particular, when b is even, [a;b]_v depends only on q=v^2.
Proof. Since [m]_{−v}=(−1)^{m−1}[m]_v, multiplying exponents across numerator and denominator gives the net factor (−1)^{b(a−b)}.
2) Symmetric–standard conversion. With q=v^2, [a;b]_v=v^{b(b−a)} [a;b]_q. This justifies switching to standard Gaussian polynomials for evaluation at roots of unity.

Uniform nonperiodicity for all N (new, to add to output.md)
Proposition. For any fixed N≥1, define g(x):=a_N(xN)=f_{xN}(ζ_N). Then for some constant C_N∈ℂ (explicitly computable from N),
- g(x)=F_{2x+1}+C_N F_{2x} for all x≥0,
- hence g satisfies g(x+2)=3g(x+1)−g(x) with g(0)=1 and is not periodic. Consequently, {a_N(n)} is not periodic in n for any N.
Proof. Write n=xN and split i=yN+r with y≥0 and 0≤r≤N−1. Using [a;b]_v=v^{b(b−a)}[a;b]_q and q=ζ_N,
[n+i;2i]_v = ζ_N^{r(r−0)}·[xN+s; 2yN+δ]_q·[a_0;b_0]_q|_{q=ζ_N},
with c=⌊(0+r)/N⌋, δ=⌊2r/N⌋, a_0=0+r−cN, b_0=2r−δN. Only the following residue blocks contribute:
- r=0: then c=δ=0, a_0=b_0=0 and [a_0;b_0]=1. The y bounds are 0≤y≤x. The contribution sums to ∑_{y=0}^x C(x+y,2y)=F_{2x+1}.
- r with N/2≤r≤N−1: then δ=1 and c=0 (since 0+r<N). The remainder [a_0;b_0]=[r;2r−N]_{ζ_N} is nonzero (as 2r−N≤r), and y runs 0≤y≤x−1 (because r>0). These contribute constants w_r:=ζ_N^{r^2}[r;2r−N]_{ζ_N} times ∑_{y=0}^{x−1} C(x+y,2y+1)=F_{2x}.
All other residues give zero: if 0<r<N/2, then δ=0 but b_0=2r>a_0=r (since s=0), so [a_0;b_0]=0; the case c=1,δ=1 cannot occur for s=0. Summing over r yields g(x)=F_{2x+1}+C_N F_{2x} with C_N=∑_{r=igN/2}^{N−1} ζ_N^{r^2} [r;2r−N]_{ζ_N}.
Since F_{2x} and F_{2x+1} satisfy H(x+2)=3H(x+1)−H(x), so does g. As g(0)=a_N(0)=1, g is not identically zero, and the only periodic solution to the recurrence is the zero sequence (characteristic roots (3±√5)/2 are not on the unit circle). Therefore g cannot be periodic, and neither can the full sequence {a_N(n)} (any global period would force periodicity on the s=0 subsequence).
Example checks. N=2: C_2=ζ_2^{1}[1;0]_{−1}=−1, so g(x)=F_{2x+1}−F_{2x}=F_{2x−1} (agrees with a_2(2t)=F_{2t−1}). N=3: C_3=ζ_3^{4}[2;1]_{ζ_3}=ζ_3(1+ζ_3)=ζ_3+ζ_3^2=−1, hence g(x)=F_{2x+1}−F_{2x}, yielding g(1)=1 as computed above.

Implications for the writeup
- Strengthen the main disproof: add the uniform Proposition above. This removes reliance on N=1,2 and explains the structural reason for nonperiodicity.
- Add the independence-from-v lemma at the start of proofs.md (ensures f_n is a function of q when the lower index is even).
- Correct the erroneous numerical claim f_3(ζ_3)=3+ζ_3 and replace it with f_3(ζ_3)=1 (include the short calculation or derive via the Proposition).
- Remove the OGF-based “period N” heuristic; it is unsupported and contradicted by the recurrence for g.

Next steps
- Optional: compute C_N for small N (e.g., C_2=−1, C_3=−1, C_4=0) to illustrate diversity and to check the Proposition numerically.
- If desired, generalize the residue-class analysis to arbitrary s to express a_N(xN+s) as a fixed linear combination of F_{2x},F_{2x+1},F_{2x+2} with coefficients in ℚ(ζ_N). This yields the same second-order recurrence for each residue class.
- Explore reductions modulo primes (Pisano-type periodicity) for these recurrences, which is a plausible positive replacement statement.

References for tools
- q–Lucas at roots of unity: for X=am+b, Y=cm+d with 0≤b,d<m, [X;Y]_q|_{q=ζ_m}=C(a,c)·[b;d]_q|_{q=ζ_m}, where C(a,c)=C(a,c)=\binom{a}{c} (standard). A short proof via the factorization of q-factorials modulo Φ_m(q) can be added to proofs.md.
- Fibonacci diagonal sums: ∑_{y=0}^x C(x+y,2y)=F_{2x+1} and ∑_{y=0}^{x−1} C(x+y,2y+1)=F_{2x}. These follow by induction using Pascal’s identity or by a standard generating-function argument.
