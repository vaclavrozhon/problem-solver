  "summary_md": "Last round fixed the intended problem (fix N, q=\u03b6_N) and produced a uniform disproof of the periodicity claim. Key reductions: convert symmetrized q-binomial to the standard q-binomial so f_n(q)=\u2211 q^{i(i\u2212n)} binom_q(n+i,2i), and use the n-OGF for bookkeeping. Writing n=xN+s and i=yN+r and applying q\u2013Lucas at q=\u03b6_N factors each summand; summing over y gives diagonal binomial sums equal to Fibonacci numbers. Consequently each residue subsequence g_s(x)=a_N(xN+s) is a Q(\u03b6_N)-linear combination of F_{2x},F_{2x+1},F_{2x+2} and satisfies g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)\u2212g_s(x). In particular the subsequence n=xN obeys f_{xN}(\u03b6_N)=F_{2x+1}+C_NF_{2x}, hence grows and is not periodic. Explicit N=1 and N=2 formulas (Fibonacci) were recorded.
