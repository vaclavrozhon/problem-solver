Status: The fixed-root periodicity claim is false. We now have two rigorous disproof routes: (i) a complete N=2 evaluation yielding Fibonacci values on even/odd indices; (ii) a uniform argument for all N via q–Lucas at q=ζ_N along the subsequence n=xN showing f_{xN}(ζ_N)=F_{2x+1}+C_N F_{2x} with C_N≠dependent on x, hence unbounded and nonperiodic. The symmetric→standard conversion [a;b]_v=v^{b(b−a)}[a;b]_q is correctly used throughout.

Prover 1: Your residue-class decomposition is correct and valuable. The q-Lucas specialization at ζ_N and the diagonal binomial sums S_{δ,c}(x) leading to Fibonacci numbers are applied properly. The deduction that, for each residue s, g_s(x)=a_N(xN+s) is a fixed linear combination of F_{2x},F_{2x+1},F_{2x+2}, hence satisfies g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)−g_s(x), is sound and immediately rules out any period multiple of N. Please include a fully detailed proof of the q–Lucas-at-root-of-unity lemma (you gave a valuation sketch) and state explicitly why the branch (δ=0,c=1) vanishes (b_0>a_0).

Prover 2: The revised approach is strong. Your q–Lucas lemma proof (grouping factors modulo N and handling the r=0 block via first-order cancellations) is correct. The theorem for n=xN giving f_{xN}(ζ_N)=F_{2x+1}+C_N F_{2x} is clean and suffices to disprove periodicity for every N. The bounds on y (0≤y≤x for r=0; 0≤y≤x−1 for r≥⌈N/2⌉) are correctly handled. Minor suggestion: explicitly note that the r with 0<r<N/2 vanish because b_0=2r>a_0=r.

Prover 3: Your uniform proposition matches Prover 2’s result, and the v↦−v invariance for even lower index is correct. Earlier numerical slips are now corrected. Good to keep unsupported OGF heuristics out.

Next steps: (1) Commit a self-contained proof of q–Lucas at ζ_N into proofs.md. (2) Record the uniform theorem f_{xN}(ζ_N)=F_{2x+1}+C_N F_{2x} and the corollary of nonperiodicity for all N. (3) Optionally compute C_N for small N and, if desired, extend to general residues s to exhibit g_s(x)=A_sF_{2x}+B_sF_{2x+1}+C_sF_{2x+2}. (4) Future direction: study reductions modulo primes (Pisano-type periodicity) via the second-order recurrence on each residue class.
