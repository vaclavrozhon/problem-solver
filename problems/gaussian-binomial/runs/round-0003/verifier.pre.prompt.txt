=== SYSTEM ===
You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md, proofs.md, and output.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers
- notes.md (informal progress & exploratory work so far)
- proofs.md (rigorous proofs & detailed mathematics so far)
- output.md (main results found so far)

**Three-tier file system guidelines**:
- **notes.md**: Readable, log of exploratory work, intuitions, failed attempts, ideas. Prefer appending. Replace only if old notes are clearly misleading. It should be self-contained: In particular, reading it should make sense without knowing the output of provers in past rounds. 

- **proofs.md**: Complete rigorous mathematical proofs with full details. Think twice before adding anything. Contains proven lemmas, theorems, and detailed derivations. Only add mathematically verified content here.
- **output.md**: This is the only file that the user is supposed to read in case your verdict is "promising". It has to be self-contained. It contains ONLY the main problem results, and a discussion why they are relevant. It is extremely selective. Think twice before promoting proofs from proofs.md to output.md. Only if the result marks clear progress on the problem, and only if the proof in proofs.md has been thoroughly vetted by provers and you, it can join output.md. Each result must be followed by a rigorous, self-contained proof that properly defines all objects of interest and is essentially publication-ready. 

Tasks:
1) Audit rigor: identify unjustified steps, false statements, missing lemmas; produce minimal counterexamples.
2) Triage value: separate genuine progress from noise.
3) Guide next steps: propose what provers should try next.

# Periodicity of $f_n(q)$ at a fixed root of unity — self-contained statement

Fix an integer $N\ge 1$. Let $v$ be a formal parameter and define

$$
[m]_v=\frac{v^{m}-v^{-m}}{v-v^{-1}},\qquad
\qbinom{a}{b}_v=\frac{[a]_v[a-1]_v\cdots[a-b+1]_v}{[b]_v[b-1]_v\cdots[1]_v},
$$

with the conventions $\qbinom{a}{0}_v=1$ and $\qbinom{a}{b}_v=0$ for $b<0$ or $b>a$. Set $q=v^{2}$ and, for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$, define

$$
f_n(q)=\sum_{i=0}^{n}\qbinom{n+i}{2i}_v .
$$

Let $\zeta_N=e^{2\pi i/N}$. Consider the sequence $a_N(n)=f_n(\zeta_N)$ for $n=0,1,2,\dots$.

**Claim.** The sequence $\{a_N(n)\}_{n\ge 0}$ is periodic in $n$ (for example, with period dividing $2N$).

# Research Notes



Problem: f_n(q)=\sum_{i=0}^n \qbinom{n+i}{2i} with [n]=(v^n−v^{−n})/(v−v^{−1}), q=v^2. Claim (original): the sequence (f_n(e^{2π i/n}))_n is periodic.

Clarifying the statement
- Two readings:
  (A) a(n)=f_n(ζ_n) with ζ_n=e^{2π i/n} (n varies with the root); this seems unlikely to be periodic.
  (B) Fix N and study a_N(n)=f_n(ζ_N); this plausibly is N-periodic.

Core identities
- Symmetrized vs standard Gaussian: for 0≤k≤n,
  \qbinom{n}{k}_{sym} = q^{−\frac{k(n−k)}2} \binom{n}{k}_q.
  Hence f_n(q)=\sum_{i=0}^n q^{i(i−n)}\,\binom{n+i}{2i}_q.
- n-OGF:
  \sum_{n≥0} f_n(q)t^n = \sum_{i≥0} \frac{t^i}{\prod_{s=−i}^{i}(1−t q^s)}.
- Half-sum at q=ζ_n:
  f_n(ζ_n)=2+\sum_{j=1}^{\lfloor n/2\rfloor} ζ_n^{−j(n−j)}\,\binom{n−j}{j}_q\big|_{q=ζ_n}.
  Derivation: apply q-Lucas with modulus n to (n+i,2i) and relabel j=n−i.

Computations and observations (reading A)
- Small n: f_2(ζ_2)=1, f_3(ζ_3)=1, f_4(ζ_4)=2, f_5(ζ_5)=2+ζ_5+ζ_5^4=2+2cos(2π/5), f_6(ζ_6)=2.
  Note: the minimal polynomial of 2+2cos(2π/5) is x^2−3x+1 (correction).
- These values already rule out very small periods, but do not yet rigorously disprove periodicity for (A).

Plausible corrected claim (reading B)
- Fix N and q=ζ_N. The OGF suggests \sum_{n≥0} f_n(q)t^n is rational with denominator a power of 1−t^N. If the global denominator reduces to 1−t^N, then n↦f_n(ζ_N) is exactly N-periodic.

Caveats
- The symmetrized q-Pascal recursion involves q^{1/2}; to avoid branch ambiguities at roots of unity, either work in v with q=v^2 (integer exponents) or use the standard q-Pascal identity and convert via the exact factor q^{−k(n−k)/2}.

Next steps
1) Disproving (A): Evaluate f_p(ζ_p) for p=7,11 via the half-sum to see whether values are pairwise distinct across infinitely many primes; aim to certify distinct minimal polynomials.
2) Proving (B): Group the OGF sum over i≡r (mod N) and show each grouped sum has denominator exactly 1−t^N (use ∏_{r=0}^{N−1}(1−t q^r)=1−t^N and telescoping across m). This would yield exact N-periodicity. Alternatively, derive a constant-coefficient linear recurrence for f_n(ζ_N).

Problem clarification and plan (fixed N)
- Task: Fix N and study a_N(n) = f_n(ζ_N) as n varies. Earlier rounds mistakenly analyzed the different problem q = e^{2π i/n} (root order tied to n). The correct setting is now fixed.

Core identities to use
- Symmetric–standard relation: [N;K]_sym(v) = v^{-K(N−K)} [N;K]_q with q=v^2. For our K=2i, K(N−K) is even, so a_N(n) is independent of the sign choice v↦−v for the fixed square root of q.
- q–Lucas at a primitive m-th root (standard Gaussian): Writing X = am + b, Y = cm + d with 0≤b,d<m, we have [X;Y]_q|_{q=ζ_m} = binom(a,c)·[b;d]_q|_{q=ζ_m}.

Immediate consequence: disproof for N=2
- Take q=ζ_2=−1, v^2=q (v=i). By q–Lucas with m=2,
  [n choose k]_{-1} = 0 if n even and k odd; else = binom(⌊n/2⌋, ⌊k/2⌋).
- Thus for odd n=2t+1, the phase v^{-2i(n−i)} = (−1)^{i(n−i)} = 1 for all i, and
  f_n(−1) = ∑_{i=0}^{2t+1} binom(t + ⌊(i+1)/2⌋, i), which is strictly increasing in t (each summand with i≥1 increases when t increases). Numerically: f_3(−1)=5, f_7(−1)=40. Hence the sequence is not periodic; the claimed period ≤ 2N = 4 is contradicted at n=3 vs 7.

Next steps
- Generalize the nonperiodicity argument for other fixed N using q–Lucas with base N. In particular, analyze the subsequence n=tN and the contributions from i multiples of N.
- Cleanly separate notes for the matched-order regime (q=e^{2π i/n}) as a distinct problem variant; do not mix it with the fixed-N analysis.

Disproof of the periodicity claim.

Setup: f_n(q)=\sum_{i=0}^n \qbinom{n+i}{2i}_v with q=v^2 and b=2i even, so \qbinom{a}{b}_v depends only on q. We study a_N(n)=f_n(\zeta_N).

Quick counterexamples:
- N=1: a_1(n)=\sum_i \binom{n+i}{2i}=F_{2n+1}, not periodic.
- N=2 (q=−1): Using the specialization \binom{a}{b}_{−1}=0 if a even, b odd; otherwise \binom{\lfloor a/2\rfloor}{\lfloor b/2\rfloor}, one gets a_2(n)=\sum_{i=0}^n \binom{\lfloor (n+i)/2\rfloor}{i}=F_{n+2}, not periodic (indeed unbounded).

Stronger structure (from residue-class decomposition): For fixed N, writing n=xN+s, one can group i=yN+r and use q-Lucas at q=\zeta_N to factor each summand into a residue-dependent constant times an ordinary binomial \binom{x+y+c}{2y+\delta}. Summing over y yields Fibonacci numbers F_{2x+\cdot}. Consequently, for each residue s the subsequence g_s(x)=a_N(xN+s) satisfies g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)−g_s(x), hence cannot be periodic unless identically zero (and g_0(0)=1). This provides a general nonperiodicity mechanism for all N.

Next steps:
- Formalize the q-Lucas-at-\zeta_N step and write the full recurrence proof.
- Explore periodicity modulo primes (Pisano-type) or closed forms for the coefficients in the decomposition for small N.

Clarified scope: We fix N and study a_N(n)=f_n(ζ_N). The earlier variant with q=ζ_n (order tied to n) is a different problem.

Key reductions:
- Symmetric vs standard Gaussian: for all a≥b≥0, with q=v^2, \qbinom{a}{b}_v = v^{b(b−a)} \qbinom{a}{b}_q. Thus f_n(q)=\sum_{i=0}^n q^{i(i−n)} \binom{n+i}{2i}_q (standard Gaussian).
- At q=ζ_N, write n=xN+s and i=yN+r. Then q^{i(i−n)}=ζ_N^{r(r−s)} depends only on residues. By q-Lucas at ζ_N, \binom{n+i}{2i}_{ζ_N}=\binom{x+y+c}{2y+δ}\,\binom{a_0}{b_0}_{ζ_N}, with δ=⌊2r/N⌋, c=⌊(s+r)/N⌋, a_0=s+r−cN, b_0=2r−δN. The case (δ=0,c=1) gives b_0>a_0 and hence vanishes.
- Fibonacci diagonal sums: S_0(x)=∑_{y≥0} \binom{x+y}{2y}=F_{2x+1}, S_1(x)=∑_{y≥0} \binom{x+y}{2y+1}=F_{2x}. Hence for each residue s, g_s(x):=a_N(xN+s)=A_sF_{2x}+B_sF_{2x+1}+C_sF_{2x+2} with constants A_s,B_s,C_s∈Q(ζ_N).
- Therefore g_s satisfies g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)−g_s(x). In particular, no g_s is periodic unless identically zero.

Counterexample (N=2): Using evaluation at q=−1 (see proofs), for odd n=2t+1 we get a_2(2t+1)=∑_{i=0}^{2t+1} \binom{t+⌊(i+1)/2⌋}{i}, which is strictly increasing in t (e.g., a_2(3)=5, a_2(5)=13). Hence {a_2(n)} is not periodic; the original claim is false.

Next steps: (i) Write a complete proof of q-Lucas at ζ_N and record the residue-class/Fibonacci decomposition rigorously. (ii) Compute A_s,B_s,C_s for small N to illustrate and quantify nonperiodicity. (iii) Optional: study periodicity modulo primes (Pisano-type behavior) using the constant-coefficient recurrence for g_s.

Disproof at fixed root (summary)\n- The fixed-N claim is false. For N=2 (q=−1) we obtain exact formulas: a_2(2t+1)=F_{2t+3}, a_2(2t)=F_{2t−1}. Hence {a_2(n)} is unbounded and not periodic. Numerical check: a_2: 1,2,1,5,2,13,5,34,13,…\n- Simpler also: N=1 gives a_1(n)=∑_{i=0}^n binom(n+i,2i)=F_{2n+1}, already nonperiodic.\n\nKey tools\n- Symmetric–standard Gaussian conversion: [A;K]_v = v^{−K(A−K)} [A\choose K]_{q}, q=v^2.\n- q–Lucas at a root of unity (m=2 here): [2a+b;2c+d]_{−1} = binom(a,c) if (b,d)≠(0,1), else 0.\n- Fibonacci sums: ∑_{j=0}^{t} binom(t+j,t−j) = F_{2t+1}, ∑_{j=0}^{t} binom(t+1+j,t−j) = F_{2t+2}, ∑_{j=0}^{t−1} binom(t+j,t−j−1)=F_{2t}.\n\nRetraction\n- Prior OGF heuristic predicting period N after specialization is incorrect in this context; repeated roots at ζ_N produce polynomial-exponential growth rather than periodicity.\n\nGeneral-N roadmap\n- Using q–Lucas with n=tN+r and i=sN+η, one gets [n+i;2i]_sym(v)=v^{−2η(r−η)}[b;d]_q·binom(t+s+δ,2s+c). The η=0 block contributes ∑_{s=0}^t binom(t+s,2s)=F_{2t+1} with coefficient 1, forcing unbounded growth along n=tN+r. Formalize this to conclude nonperiodicity for all N.\n

Fixed-N analysis and counterexample

- We fix N and study a_N(n)=f_n(ζ_N) where f_n(q)=∑_{i=0}^n \qbinom{n+i}{2i}_v with q=v^2. Because the lower index is even, \qbinom{a}{2i}_v depends only on q.
- Symmetric vs standard: \qbinom{a}{b}_v = v^{b(b−a)} [a;b]_q with q=v^2; hence f_n(q)=∑_{i=0}^n q^{i(i−n)} [n+i;2i]_q.
- q–Lucas at q=ζ_N: Writing n=xN+s and i=yN+r, each summand factors as ζ_N^{r(r−s)}·binom(x+y+c,2y+δ)·[a_0;b_0]_{ζ_N}, where c=⌊(s+r)/N⌋, δ=⌊2r/N⌋, a_0=s+r−cN, b_0=2r−δN. The case (δ=0,c=1) has b_0>a_0 and vanishes. Summing over y gives Fibonacci diagonals, so g_s(x):=a_N(xN+s)=A_sF_{2x}+B_sF_{2x+1}+C_sF_{2x+2}, hence g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)−g_s(x).
- Immediate counterexample (N=2): For odd n=2t+1, the twist (−1)^{i(i−n)}=1 and [n+i;2i]_{−1}=binom(t+⌊(i+1)/2⌋,i), giving a_2(2t+1)=F_{2t+3}. For even n=2t≥2, a_2(2t)=F_{2t−1} (and a_2(0)=1). Thus {a_2(n)} is unbounded and not periodic. Example values: 1,2,1,5,2,13,5,34,⋯ (correcting the earlier mistaken a_2(7)=34, not 40).

Next steps: (i) Write a complete proof of the q–Lucas specialization at ζ_N. (ii) Compute the constants A_s,B_s,C_s for small N to exhibit the recurrence numerically. (iii) Optionally, investigate reductions modulo primes (eventual periodicity).

Clarified scope: We fix N and study a_N(n) = f_n(ζ_N). The earlier variant q = ζ_n (order tied to n) is a different problem and not used here.

Key reductions for fixed N:
- Symmetric vs standard Gaussian: for a≥b≥0 and q=v^2, we have [a;b]_v = v^{b(b−a)} [a;b]_q. Thus f_n(q) = ∑_{i=0}^n q^{i(i−n)} [n+i; 2i]_q.
- At q = ζ_N, writing n = xN + s and i = yN + r, the twist q^{i(i−n)} reduces to ζ_N^{r(r−s)} (residue-dependent). Apply q-Lucas at ζ_N to factor [n+i; 2i]_q into an ordinary binomial in (x,y) and a small Gaussian in residues (s,r). The branch (δ=0,c=1) vanishes since then b_0 > a_0.
- Summing over y yields Fibonacci diagonal sums: S_0(x) = ∑_{y≥0} C(x+y, 2y) = F_{2x+1}, S_1(x) = ∑_{y≥0} C(x+y, 2y+1) = F_{2x}. Consequently, for each residue s, g_s(x):=a_N(xN+s) = A_s F_{2x} + B_s F_{2x+1} + C_s F_{2x+2} with constants A_s,B_s,C_s ∈ Q(ζ_N), so g_s satisfies g_s(x+2) = 3 g_s(x+1) − g_s(x) and is not periodic unless zero (but g_0(0)=1).

Counterexamples:
- N=2: a_2(2t+1)=F_{2t+3}, a_2(2t)=F_{2t−1}; hence {a_2(n)} is unbounded (e.g., 1,2,1,5,2,13,5,34,…) and not periodic.
- N=1: f_n(1)=∑_{i=0}^n C(n+i,2i)=F_{2n+1}, also not periodic.

Corrections: Earlier value a_2(7) was misstated; correct is 34.

Next steps: (i) Write a complete proof of the q-Lucas specialization at q=ζ_N; (ii) compute coefficients A_s,B_s,C_s explicitly for small N to illustrate growth; (iii) optionally, explore periodicity modulo primes using the constant-coefficient recurrence for each residue subsequence.

Uniform nonperiodicity at fixed N via residue classes

Setup: For a formal parameter v, define [m]_v=(v^m−v^{−m})/(v−v^{−1}) and [a;b]_v=(product [a]⋯[a−b+1])/(product [b]⋯[1]). Let q=v^2. The symmetric–standard conversion gives [a;b]_v = v^{b(b−a)} [a;b]_q (standard Gaussian). Thus f_n(q)=∑_{i=0}^n q^{i(i−n)} [n+i;2i]_q.

q‑Lucas at q=ζ_N: Write n=xN+s and i=yN+r with 0≤s,r<N. Let c=⌊(s+r)/N⌋, δ=⌊2r/N⌋, a_0=s+r−cN, b_0=2r−δN. Then at q=ζ_N,
[n+i;2i]_q = 0 if b_0>a_0, and otherwise equals C(x+y+c, 2y+δ)·[a_0;b_0]_q. The twist simplifies to q^{i(i−n)}=ζ_N^{r(r−s)}.

Summing over y: Using the diagonal identities S_0(x)=∑_{y≥0} C(x+y,2y)=F_{2x+1} and S_1(x)=∑_{y≥0} C(x+y,2y+1)=F_{2x}, we get for each residue s
  g_s(x):=a_N(xN+s)=A_s F_{2x}+B_s F_{2x+1}+C_s F_{2x+2},
with constants A_s,B_s,C_s in Q(ζ_N) depending only on (N,s). Hence g_s satisfies g_s(x+2)=3 g_s(x+1)−g_s(x) and is not periodic unless zero. Since g_0(0)=1, a global period cannot exist.

Concrete s=0 formula: For s=0, only r=0 and r in {⌈N/2⌉,…,N−1} contribute. One finds
  a_N(xN)=F_{2x+1} + C_N F_{2x},
with C_N = ∑_{r=⌈N/2⌉}^{N−1} ζ_N^{r^2} [r;2r−N]_{ζ_N}. This exhibits an explicit nonperiodic second‑order recurrence along n=xN.

Examples: N=2 gives C_2=−1 and a_2(2x)=F_{2x−1}. N=3 gives C_3=−1 and a_3(3x)=F_{2x+1}−F_{2x}.

Next steps: (i) Formalize the q‑Lucas-at-ζ_N lemma in proofs.md; (ii) record the n=xN proposition; (iii) compute A_s,B_s,C_s for small N and s; (iv) explore periodicity modulo primes using the fixed second‑order recurrences.

Main result: the fixed-root periodicity claim is false

Definitions. For a formal parameter v, set [m]_v=(v^m−v^{−m})/(v−v^{−1}) and [A;B]_v=([A]_v⋯[A−B+1]_v)/([B]_v⋯[1]_v), with the usual conventions. Let q=v^2 and define f_n(q)=∑_{i=0}^n [n+i; 2i]_v. For fixed N≥1, write ζ_N=e^{2πi/N} and a_N(n)=f_n(ζ_N).

Theorem (counterexample at N=2). For N=2 (q=−1), the sequence a_2(n)=f_n(−1) is not periodic. In fact, for t≥0,
- a_2(2t+1)=F_{2t+3},
- a_2(2t)=F_{2t−1} (with a_2(0)=1=F_{−1}),
where F_k denotes the Fibonacci sequence (F_0=0, F_1=1, F_{k+1}=F_k+F_{k−1}). Thus {a_2(n)} is unbounded; for example a_2(1)=2, a_2(3)=5, a_2(5)=13, a_2(7)=34.

Proof. Relate the symmetric and standard Gaussian coefficients: for all a≥b≥0 and q=v^2,
  [a;b]_v = v^{b(b−a)} [a;b]_q.
Hence
  f_n(−1)=∑_{i=0}^n (−1)^{i(i−n)} [n+i;2i]_q|_{q=−1}.
At q=−1, the standard Gaussian specializes as follows: for 0≤k≤n,
  [n;k]_q|_{q=−1}=0 if n is even and k is odd, and otherwise equals C(⌊n/2⌋, ⌊k/2⌋).
This is proved by induction from the q-Pascal recursion [n;k]_q=[n−1;k]_q+q^{n−k}[n−1;k−1]_q.
For odd n=2t+1, the sign factor is 1 since i(i−n) is even, so
  a_2(2t+1)=∑_{j=0}^t C(t+j, 2j) + ∑_{j=0}^t C(t+j+1, 2j+1) = F_{2t+1}+F_{2t+2}=F_{2t+3}.
For even n=2t, the sign factor is (−1)^i, giving
  a_2(2t)=∑_{j=0}^t C(t+j, 2j) − ∑_{j=0}^{t−1} C(t+j, 2j+1) = F_{2t+1}−F_{2t}=F_{2t−1}.
The Fibonacci equalities follow from the standard diagonal-sum identities ∑_{y≥0} C(x+y, 2y)=F_{2x+1} and ∑_{y≥0} C(x+y, 2y+1)=F_{2x}. Therefore a_2 is not periodic, and the general claim of periodicity (e.g., with period dividing 2N) is false. ∎

Ideas
- Convert the symmetric Gaussian to the standard Gaussian with q=v^2, isolating a simple q-power factor. Then specialize at q=ζ_N.
- Apply q–Lucas at a primitive N-th root to split each term into an ordinary binomial (block index) times a small Gaussian (residue). Summing the ordinary binomial tails gives Fibonacci numbers.
- For each residue s (n=xN+s), obtain g_s(x)=a_N(xN+s) as a fixed linear combination of F_{2x}, F_{2x+1}, F_{2x+2}; hence g_s satisfies g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)−g_s(x). Nontrivial solutions are not periodic.

Reduction to standard Gaussians
For integers a≥b≥0 and q=v^2,
  \[\qbinom{a}{b}_v = v^{b(b−a)}\,[a;b]_q = q^{\frac{b(b−a)}2}\,[a;b]_q.\]
Hence
  \[f_n(q)=\sum_{i=0}^n q^{i(i−n)}\,[n+i;2i]_q.\]
At q=ζ_N and i=yN+r, n=xN+s (0≤r,s<N), we have q^{i(i−n)}=q^{r(r−s)}.

q–Lucas at q=ζ_N (precise statement and proof)
Write a=a_1N+a_0, b=b_1N+b_0 with 0≤a_0,b_0<N. Then at q=ζ_N,
  [a;b]_q=0 if b_0>a_0, and [a;b]_q=\binom{a_1}{b_1}\,[a_0;b_0]_q if b_0≤a_0.
Proof. Using (q;q)_m=∏_{j=1}^m(1−q^j) and the factorization
  (q;q)_m=∏_{r=0}^{N−1}(q^{r+1};q^N)_{\lfloor\frac{m−r}{N}\rfloor},
we get
  [a;b]_q=\prod_{r=0}^{N−1}\frac{(q^{r+1};q^N)_{\lfloor\frac{a−r}{N}\rfloor}}{(q^{r+1};q^N)_{\lfloor\frac{b−r}{N}\rfloor}(q^{r+1};q^N)_{\lfloor\frac{a−b−r}{N}\rfloor}}.
For r=0, the quotient tends to \frac{(q^N;q^N)_{a_1}}{(q^N;q^N)_{b_1}(q^N;q^N)_{a_1−b_1−c}}, where c=1 if a_0<b_0 and c=0 otherwise. Thus it is 0 iff a_0<b_0; if a_0≥b_0 it equals [a_1;b_1]_{q^N}, which at q^N=1 is \binom{a_1}{b_1}. For r∈{1,…,N−1}, one checks that the quotient equals (q^{r+1};q^N)_{ε_r}/(q^{r+1};q^N)_{δ_r} with ε_r−δ_r∈{0,1}, and the product over r>0 simplifies to [a_0;b_0]_q. Combining yields the stated formula.

Fibonacci diagonal sums
For x≥0 and δ,c∈{0,1}, define S_{δ,c}(x)=∑_{y≥0}\binom{x+y+c}{2y+δ}. Then
  S_{0,0}(x)=F_{2x+1}, S_{1,0}(x)=F_{2x}, S_{1,1}(x)=F_{2x+2}, S_{0,1}(x)=F_{2x+3}.
Proof: Induction via Pascal’s identity; note S_{δ,1}(x)=S_{δ,0}(x+1).

Residue-class decomposition and recurrence
Fix N and q=ζ_N. Let n=xN+s. With i=yN+r and
  c=\lfloor\tfrac{s+r}{N}\rfloor, δ=\lfloor\tfrac{2r}{N}\rfloor, a_0=s+r−cN, b_0=2r−δN,
q–Lucas gives
  [n+i;2i]_q=\binom{x+y+c}{2y+δ}\,[a_0;b_0]_q, with the term vanishing iff b_0>a_0 (which holds in particular for δ=0,c=1). Therefore
  g_s(x):=f_{xN+s}(q)=\sum_{r=0}^{N−1} q^{r(r−s)}\,[a_0(r);b_0(r)]_q\,S_{δ(r),c(r)}(x).
Equivalently, there exist constants A_s,B_s,C_s∈ℚ(ζ_N) such that
  g_s(x)=A_s F_{2x}+B_s F_{2x+1}+C_s F_{2x+2}.
Hence, for each s,
  g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)−g_s(x) for all x≥0.

Nonperiodicity
If {a_N(n)} were periodic (any period P>0), then for each residue s, g_s(x)=a_N(xN+s) would be periodic with period M/N where M=lcm(P,N). A nonzero sequence obeying g(x+2)=3g(x+1)−g(x) cannot be periodic (characteristic roots (3±√5)/2 have |·|≠1). Since g_0(0)=f_0(ζ_N)=1, g_0 is nonzero. Contradiction. Thus the claim is false for every N≥1.

Explicit examples (verifiable)
- N=3. For s=0,1,2 one finds
  a_3(3x)=F_{2x+1}−F_{2x}=F_{2x−1}, a_3(3x+1)=2F_{2x+1}, a_3(3x+2)=F_{2x+3}.
- N=4. For s=0,1,2,3 one finds
  a_4(4x)=F_{2x+1}, a_4(4x+1)=2F_{2x+1}−F_{2x}, a_4(4x+2)=2F_{2x+1}+F_{2x+2}, a_4(4x+3)=F_{2x+1}.
These satisfy g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)−g_s(x) and are plainly nonperiodic.

Notes on vanishing case (δ=0,c=1)
Here 2r<N and s+r≥N, so b_0=2r and a_0=s+r−N. Then b_0−a_0=r−s+N>0, hence b_0>a_0, and the term vanishes by q–Lucas.

Obstacles
- A fully detailed proof of the r>0 factor in q–Lucas (grouping via (q^{r+1};q^N)-Pochhammers) is straightforward but notationally heavy; we sketched the standard reduction.

Next steps
- Write the full q–Lucas-at-ζ_N proof using (q^{r+1};q^N)-factorization; add to proofs.md.
- Record the residue/Fibonacci decomposition and the recurrence as a theorem in output.md.
- Compute A_s,B_s,C_s for small N (we provided N=3,4) and verify numerically for initial x.
- Optional: study reductions modulo primes; each g_s satisfies a constant-coefficient recurrence, hence is eventually periodic modulo p (Pisano-type behavior).

Ideas
- Prove a q-Lucas specialization at a primitive N-th root of unity ζ_N for Gaussian binomials. This is the main structural tool that reduces indices modulo N and isolates an ordinary binomial factor.
- Apply it to f_{xN}(ζ_N) along the subsequence n = xN. The r = 0 residue block alone produces a Fibonacci diagonal sum F_{2x+1}. The remaining residue blocks contribute a fixed constant times F_{2x}. Hence f_{xN}(ζ_N) = F_{2x+1} + C_N F_{2x} for an explicit constant C_N ∈ Q(ζ_N). This proves unbounded growth and nonperiodicity for any fixed N.

Symmetric-to-standard conversion
For q = v^2 and a ≥ b ≥ 0, the symmetric Gaussian equals the standard Gaussian times a power of v:

(1)  \qbinom{a}{b}_v = v^{b(b−a)} \binom{a}{b}_q.

Hence

(2)  f_n(q) = ∑_{i=0}^{n} q^{i(i−n)} \binom{n+i}{2i}_q,

where \binom{•}{•}_q denotes the standard Gaussian polynomial in q.

q-Lucas at roots of unity
Proposition (q-Lucas at ζ_N). Fix N ≥ 1 and let ζ = ζ_N be a primitive N-th root of unity. Write n = aN + b and k = cN + d with 0 ≤ b, d < N and a, c ≥ 0. Then

(3)  \binom{n}{k}_q\big|_{q=ζ} = \begin{cases} \binom{a}{c}\, \binom{b}{d}_q\big|_{q=ζ}, & d ≤ b,\\ 0, & d > b. \end{cases}

Proof. The standard Gaussian has the product form

\binom{n}{k}_q = ∏_{j=1}^{k} \frac{1 − q^{n−k+j}}{1 − q^{j}}.

We evaluate at q = ζ via a limiting argument (the result equals the limit since the left-hand side is a polynomial in q). Let q approach ζ radially so q^N → 1. Group the factors by j modulo N.
- For residue classes r ∈ {1,…,N−1} (i.e., j ≡ r mod N), the denominators 1 − q^{j} stay away from 0 as q → ζ. Using q^N → 1, all such blocks converge to the same ratios one would get by replacing q^{tN+r} with q^{r}, producing exactly the factor \binom{b}{d}_q|_{q=ζ} provided d ≤ b; if d > b there are more denominator than numerator factors with the same residue, forcing zero in the limit.
- For the residue class r ≡ 0 (multiples of N), write the j’s as j = tN (1 ≤ t ≤ c) in the denominator and j′ = n − k + j = (a − c + t)N + (b − d) in the numerator. The unique vanishing factor in each N-block occurs at exponents multiple of N; its first-order behavior is 1 − q^{tN} ≈ −t(q^N − 1). Hence

∏_{t=1}^{c} (1 − q^{tN}) in the denominator and ∏_{t=1}^{a−c} (1 − q^{tN}) in the remaining denominator (from (n − k)-block) jointly cancel all but the numerator ∏_{t=1}^{a} (1 − q^{tN}). Taking the ratio of these 0/0 products as q → ζ gives

\frac{∏_{t=1}^{a} t}{(∏_{t=1}^{c} t)(∏_{t=1}^{a−c} t)} = \binom{a}{c}.

Multiplying the nonzero-residue contribution with this yields (3). ∎

Two diagonal binomial sums
For x ≥ 0,

(4)  ∑_{y=0}^{x} \binom{x+y}{2y} = F_{2x+1},

(5)  ∑_{y=0}^{x-1} \binom{x+y}{2y+1} = F_{2x},

where F_n is the Fibonacci sequence (F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1). A concise proof uses generating functions: set S(x) = ∑_{y=0}^{x} \binom{x+y}{2y}, T(x) = ∑_{y=0}^{x-1} \binom{x+y}{2y+1}. Then

∑_{x≥0} S(x) t^x = ∑_{y≥0} t^y \sum_{m≥0} \binom{m+2y}{2y} t^m = ∑_{y≥0} \frac{t^y}{(1−t)^{2y+1}} = \frac{1−t}{1 − 3t + t^2},

∑_{x≥0} T(x) t^x = ∑_{y≥0} t^{y+1} \sum_{m≥0} \binom{m+2y+1}{2y+1} t^m = \frac{t}{1 − 3t + t^2}.

These are the OGFs of F_{2x+1} and F_{2x}, respectively.

Nonperiodicity for fixed N via the subsequence n = xN
Theorem. For any fixed N ≥ 1 and ζ = ζ_N, define a_N(n) = f_n(ζ). For x ≥ 1,

(6)  f_{xN}(ζ) = F_{2x+1} + C_N F_{2x},

with

(7)  C_N = ∑_{r=\lceil N/2\rceil}^{N−1} ζ^{r^2} \binom{r}{2r−N}_q\Big|_{q=ζ} ∈ \mathbb{Q}(ζ).

In particular, the subsequence {f_{xN}(ζ)}_{x≥0} is unbounded, so {a_N(n)} is not periodic.

Proof. Start from (2) with n = xN:

f_{xN}(ζ) = ∑_{i=0}^{xN} ζ^{i(i−xN)} \binom{xN+i}{2i}_q\Big|_{q=ζ}.

Write i = yN + r with 0 ≤ r ≤ N−1 and y ≥ 0. Then ζ^{i(i−xN)} = ζ^{r^2}. Apply q-Lucas (3) with a = x + y, b = r, c = 2y, d = 2r, so δ := ⌊2r/N⌋ ∈ {0,1} and

\binom{xN + yN + r}{2yN + 2r}_q\Big|_{q=ζ} = \binom{x+y}{2y + δ} ⋅ \binom{r}{2r − δN}_q\Big|_{q=ζ}.

Because r < N, c = ⌊(0 + r)/N⌋ = 0, so only δ matters. If δ = 0 (i.e., 2r < N), then \binom{r}{2r}_q vanishes unless r = 0. Thus the only δ = 0 contribution is r = 0, giving

∑_{y=0}^{x} \binom{x+y}{2y} = F_{2x+1}.

If δ = 1 (i.e., r ≥ ⌈N/2⌉), then the admissible y satisfy y ≤ ⌊(xN − r)/N⌋ = x − 1, and we get

∑_{y=0}^{x−1} \binom{x+y}{2y+1} = F_{2x},

multiplied by the constant factor ζ^{r^2} \binom{r}{2r−N}_q|_{q=ζ}. Summing over r yields (6)–(7). Since F_{2x+1} grows strictly with x and appears with coefficient 1, the subsequence f_{xN}(ζ) is unbounded, proving nonperiodicity. ∎

Examples
- N = 1: C_1 = 0, so f_{x}(1) = F_{2x+1}. Nonperiodic.
- N = 2: r runs over {1}, so C_2 = ζ_2^{1} \binom{1}{0}_q|_{q=−1} = −1 and f_{2x}(−1) = F_{2x+1} − F_{2x} = F_{2x−1} (x ≥ 1), agreeing with the explicit formulas a_2(2t) = F_{2t−1}, a_2(2t+1) = F_{2t+3}.

Obstacles and corrections
- A previous product-identity approach asserting periodicity failed; exact block identities with x = ±1 specializations do not hold in general and contradict explicit N = 2 values. The correct structure is the q-Lucas factorization above.

Next steps
- Compute C_N explicitly for small N to illustrate the linear form f_{xN}(ζ) = F_{2x+1} + C_N F_{2x}.
- Extend the decomposition to all residue classes s (n = xN + s), yielding explicit constants A_s, B_s with f_{xN+s}(ζ) = A_s F_{2x+1} + B_s F_{2x} + possibly C_s F_{2x+2} when (δ, c) = (1,1) occurs. This furnishes a uniform nonperiodicity proof for every s.
- Investigate reductions modulo primes (Pisano-type periodicity) using the second-order recurrence satisfied by each residue subsequence.

Summary
- The q-Lucas specialization (3) at q = ζ_N is established via product grouping and a first-order cancellation at multiples of N, yielding an ordinary binomial factor \binom{a}{c}.
- For n = xN, only the r = 0 block (δ = 0) and the blocks with r ≥ ⌈N/2⌉ (δ = 1) contribute, giving the exact formula f_{xN}(ζ) = F_{2x+1} + C_N F_{2x}. The subsequence is unbounded, hence the fixed-root periodicity claim is false for every N ≥ 1.


=== Prover 3 Output ===

Ideas and scope
- The fixed-root periodicity claim is false. The current writeup gives a correct and clean disproof for N=2. This can be strengthened to a uniform disproof for all N by analyzing the subsequence n=xN (i.e., residue class s=0) via q–Lucas at q=ζ_N.
- Clarify well-posedness: since the lower index is 2i (even), each summand depends only on q=v^2 (not the choice of v). This should be explicitly proved once and used.
- Remove or clearly label unsupported heuristics (e.g., OGF rationality leading to period N). They are not justified and contradict the actual behavior.

Corrections and clarity
- Fix a numerical error in prior notes: f_3(ζ_3)=1, not 3+ζ_3. A direct computation using standard Gaussians shows [4;2]_{ζ_3}=0 and [5;4]_{ζ_3}=1+ζ_3+ζ_3^2+ζ_3^3+ζ_3^4, together yielding f_3(ζ_3)=3+2ζ_3+2ζ_3^2=1.
- Add the simple N=1 counterexample: f_n(1)=∑_{i=0}^n C(n+i,2i)=F_{2n+1}, hence nonperiodic.

Rigorous additions: two lemmas
1) Independence from the square root.
Lemma. For 0≤b≤a, we have [a;b]_{−v}=(−1)^{b(a−b)}[a;b]_v. In particular, when b is even, [a;b]_v depends only on q=v^2.
Proof. Since [m]_{−v}=(−1)^{m−1}[m]_v, multiplying exponents across numerator and denominator gives the net factor (−1)^{b(a−b)}.
2) Symmetric–standard conversion. With q=v^2, [a;b]_v=v^{b(b−a)} [a;b]_q. This justifies switching to standard Gaussian polynomials for evaluation at roots of unity.

Uniform nonperiodicity for all N (new, to add to output.md)
Proposition. For any fixed N≥1, define g(x):=a_N(xN)=f_{xN}(ζ_N). Then for some constant C_N∈ℂ (explicitly computable from N),
- g(x)=F_{2x+1}+C_N F_{2x} for all x≥0,
- hence g satisfies g(x+2)=3g(x+1)−g(x) with g(0)=1 and is not periodic. Consequently, {a_N(n)} is not periodic in n for any N.
Proof. Write n=xN and split i=yN+r with y≥0 and 0≤r≤N−1. Using [a;b]_v=v^{b(b−a)}[a;b]_q and q=ζ_N,
[n+i;2i]_v = ζ_N^{r(r−0)}·[xN+s; 2yN+δ]_q·[a_0;b_0]_q|_{q=ζ_N},
with c=⌊(0+r)/N⌋, δ=⌊2r/N⌋, a_0=0+r−cN, b_0=2r−δN. Only the following residue blocks contribute:
- r=0: then c=δ=0, a_0=b_0=0 and [a_0;b_0]=1. The y bounds are 0≤y≤x. The contribution sums to ∑_{y=0}^x C(x+y,2y)=F_{2x+1}.
- r with N/2≤r≤N−1: then δ=1 and c=0 (since 0+r<N). The remainder [a_0;b_0]=[r;2r−N]_{ζ_N} is nonzero (as 2r−N≤r), and y runs 0≤y≤x−1 (because r>0). These contribute constants w_r:=ζ_N^{r^2}[r;2r−N]_{ζ_N} times ∑_{y=0}^{x−1} C(x+y,2y+1)=F_{2x}.
All other residues give zero: if 0<r<N/2, then δ=0 but b_0=2r>a_0=r (since s=0), so [a_0;b_0]=0; the case c=1,δ=1 cannot occur for s=0. Summing over r yields g(x)=F_{2x+1}+C_N F_{2x} with C_N=∑_{r=igN/2}^{N−1} ζ_N^{r^2} [r;2r−N]_{ζ_N}.
Since F_{2x} and F_{2x+1} satisfy H(x+2)=3H(x+1)−H(x), so does g. As g(0)=a_N(0)=1, g is not identically zero, and the only periodic solution to the recurrence is the zero sequence (characteristic roots (3±√5)/2 are not on the unit circle). Therefore g cannot be periodic, and neither can the full sequence {a_N(n)} (any global period would force periodicity on the s=0 subsequence).
Example checks. N=2: C_2=ζ_2^{1}[1;0]_{−1}=−1, so g(x)=F_{2x+1}−F_{2x}=F_{2x−1} (agrees with a_2(2t)=F_{2t−1}). N=3: C_3=ζ_3^{4}[2;1]_{ζ_3}=ζ_3(1+ζ_3)=ζ_3+ζ_3^2=−1, hence g(x)=F_{2x+1}−F_{2x}, yielding g(1)=1 as computed above.

Implications for the writeup
- Strengthen the main disproof: add the uniform Proposition above. This removes reliance on N=1,2 and explains the structural reason for nonperiodicity.
- Add the independence-from-v lemma at the start of proofs.md (ensures f_n is a function of q when the lower index is even).
- Correct the erroneous numerical claim f_3(ζ_3)=3+ζ_3 and replace it with f_3(ζ_3)=1 (include the short calculation or derive via the Proposition).
- Remove the OGF-based “period N” heuristic; it is unsupported and contradicted by the recurrence for g.

Next steps
- Optional: compute C_N for small N (e.g., C_2=−1, C_3=−1, C_4=0) to illustrate diversity and to check the Proposition numerically.
- If desired, generalize the residue-class analysis to arbitrary s to express a_N(xN+s) as a fixed linear combination of F_{2x},F_{2x+1},F_{2x+2} with coefficients in ℚ(ζ_N). This yields the same second-order recurrence for each residue class.
- Explore reductions modulo primes (Pisano-type periodicity) for these recurrences, which is a plausible positive replacement statement.

References for tools
- q–Lucas at roots of unity: for X=am+b, Y=cm+d with 0≤b,d<m, [X;Y]_q|_{q=ζ_m}=C(a,c)·[b;d]_q|_{q=ζ_m}, where C(a,c)=C(a,c)=\binom{a}{c} (standard). A short proof via the factorization of q-factorials modulo Φ_m(q) can be added to proofs.md.
- Fibonacci diagonal sums: ∑_{y=0}^x C(x+y,2y)=F_{2x+1} and ∑_{y=0}^{x−1} C(x+y,2y+1)=F_{2x}. These follow by induction using Pascal’s identity or by a standard generating-function argument.
