We established a uniform disproof of the fixed-root periodicity claim. Using the symmetric→standard conversion and a q–Lucas specialization at q=ζ_N, we showed that along the subsequence n=xN one has f_{xN}(ζ_N)=F_{2x+1}+C_N F_{2x}, which grows and hence is not periodic. Prover 1’s residue-class/Fibonacci decomposition further shows each residue subsequence satisfies g(x+2)=3g(x+1)−g(x), precluding any period multiple of N. We updated output.md with the uniform counterexample and proofs.md with the q–Lucas lemma and the n=xN theorem.
