{"feedback_md":"Status: The fixed-root periodicity claim is false. We now have two rigorous disproof routes: (i) a complete N=2 evaluation yielding Fibonacci values on even/odd indices; (ii) a uniform argument for all N via q–Lucas at q=ζ_N along the subsequence n=xN showing f_{xN}(ζ_N)=F_{2x+1}+C_N F_{2x} with C_N≠dependent on x, hence unbounded and nonperiodic. The symmetric→standard conversion [a;b]_v=v^{b(b−a)}[a;b]_q is correctly used throughout.\n\nProver 1: Your residue-class decomposition is correct and valuable. The q-Lucas specialization at ζ_N and the diagonal binomial sums S_{δ,c}(x) leading to Fibonacci numbers are applied properly. The deduction that, for each residue s, g_s(x)=a_N(xN+s) is a fixed linear combination of F_{2x},F_{2x+1},F_{2x+2}, hence satisfies g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)−g_s(x), is sound and immediately rules out any period multiple of N. Please include a fully detailed proof of the q–Lucas-at-root-of-unity lemma (you gave a valuation sketch) and state explicitly why the branch (δ=0,c=1) vanishes (b_0>a_0).\n\nProver 2: The revised approach is strong. Your q–Lucas lemma proof (grouping factors modulo N and handling the r=0 block via first-order cancellations) is correct. The theorem for n=xN giving f_{xN}(ζ_N)=F_{2x+1}+C_N F_{2x} is clean and suffices to disprove periodicity for every N. The bounds on y (0≤y≤x for r=0; 0≤y≤x−1 for r≥⌈N/2⌉) are correctly handled. Minor suggestion: explicitly note that the r with 0<r<N/2 vanish because b_0=2r>a_0=r.\n\nProver 3: Your uniform proposition matches Prover 2’s result, and the v↦−v invariance for even lower index is correct. Earlier numerical slips are now corrected. Good to keep unsupported OGF heuristics out.\n\nNext steps: (1) Commit a self-contained proof of q–Lucas at ζ_N into proofs.md. (2) Record the uniform theorem f_{xN}(ζ_N)=F_{2x+1}+C_N F_{2x} and the corollary of nonperiodicity for all N. (3) Optionally compute C_N for small N and, if desired, extend to general residues s to exhibit g_s(x)=A_sF_{2x}+B_sF_{2x+1}+C_sF_{2x+2}. (4) Future direction: study reductions modulo primes (Pisano-type periodicity) via the second-order recurrence on each residue class.","summary_md":"We established a uniform disproof of the fixed-root periodicity claim.

Let ζ be a primitive N-th root of unity. Write a=a_1N+a_0, b=b_1N+b_0 with 0≤a_0,b_0<N. Then\n[a;b]_q|_{q=ζ} = 0 if b_0>a_0, and equals binom(a_1,b_1)·[a_0;b_0]_q|_{q=ζ} if b_0≤a_0.\nProof. Use the product form [a;b]_q=(q;q)_a/((q;q)_b(q;q)_{a−b}) and the multiplicity of the factor 1−q^N in (q;q)_m, which is ⌊m/N⌋. The net multiplicity in the ratio is ⌊a/N⌋−⌊b/N⌋−⌊(a−b)/N⌋, which equals 1 iff b_0>a_0 and 0 otherwise; hence vanishing occurs exactly when b_0>a_0. When the net multiplicity is 0, group factors by residue j mod N. For residues r∈{1,…,N−1}, no factor vanishes at q=ζ and the grouped ratios tend to the corresponding factors for [a_0;b_0]_q at q=ζ. For r≡0 (multiples of N), the first-order behavior near q^N=1 yields the ordinary binomial binom(a_1,b_1). Multiplying contributions gives the stated formula.\n\nLemma (Fibonacci diagonal sums).

From the conversion lemma,\nf_n(ζ)=∑_{i=0}^n ζ^{i(i−n)} [n+i;2i]_q|_{q=ζ}.\nSet n=xN and write i=yN+r with 0≤r<N, y≥0. Then ζ^{i(i−n)}=ζ^{r^2}. Apply q–Lucas with a=xN+yN+r and b=2yN+2r. Let δ=⌊2r/N⌋ and a_0=r, b_0=2r−δN. If r=0, then δ=0 and [a;b]_q=binom(x+y,2y); summing y=0..x gives F_{2x+1}. If 0<r<N/2, then δ=0 and b_0=2r>a_0=r, so the term vanishes. If ⌈N/2⌉≤r≤N−1, then δ=1 and [a;b]_q=binom(x+y,2y+1)[r;2r−N]_q; summing y=0..x−1 gives F_{2x}. Summing over r yields the formula with constant C_N.
