# Periodicity of $f_n(q)$ at a fixed root of unity — self-contained statement

Fix an integer $N\ge 1$. Let $v$ be a formal parameter and define

$$
[m]_v=\frac{v^{m}-v^{-m}}{v-v^{-1}},\qquad
\qbinom{a}{b}_v=\frac{[a]_v[a-1]_v\cdots[a-b+1]_v}{[b]_v[b-1]_v\cdots[1]_v},
$$

with the conventions $\qbinom{a}{0}_v=1$ and $\qbinom{a}{b}_v=0$ for $b<0$ or $b>a$. Set $q=v^{2}$ and, for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$, define

$$
f_n(q)=\sum_{i=0}^{n}\qbinom{n+i}{2i}_v .
$$

Let $\zeta_N=e^{2\pi i/N}$. Consider the sequence $a_N(n)=f_n(\zeta_N)$ for $n=0,1,2,\dots$.

**Claim.** The sequence $\{a_N(n)\}_{n\ge 0}$ is periodic in $n$ (for example, with period dividing $2N$).

Problem: f_n(q)=\sum_{i=0}^n \qbinom{n+i}{2i} with [n]=(v^n−v^{−n})/(v−v^{−1}), q=v^2. Claim (original): the sequence (f_n(e^{2π i/n}))_n is periodic.

Clarifying the statement
- Two readings:
  (A) a(n)=f_n(ζ_n) with ζ_n=e^{2π i/n} (n varies with the root); this seems unlikely to be periodic.
  (B) Fix N and study a_N(n)=f_n(ζ_N); this plausibly is N-periodic.

Core identities
- Symmetrized vs standard Gaussian: for 0≤k≤n,
  \qbinom{n}{k}_{sym} = q^{−\frac{k(n−k)}2} \binom{n}{k}_q.
  Hence f_n(q)=\sum_{i=0}^n q^{i(i−n)}\,\binom{n+i}{2i}_q.
- n-OGF:
  \sum_{n≥0} f_n(q)t^n = \sum_{i≥0} \frac{t^i}{\prod_{s=−i}^{i}(1−t q^s)}.
- Half-sum at q=ζ_n:
  f_n(ζ_n)=2+\sum_{j=1}^{\lfloor n/2\rfloor} ζ_n^{−j(n−j)}\,\binom{n−j}{j}_q\big|_{q=ζ_n}.
  Derivation: apply q-Lucas with modulus n to (n+i,2i) and relabel j=n−i.

Computations and observations (reading A)
- Small n: f_2(ζ_2)=1, f_3(ζ_3)=1, f_4(ζ_4)=2, f_5(ζ_5)=2+ζ_5+ζ_5^4=2+2cos(2π/5), f_6(ζ_6)=2.
  Note: the minimal polynomial of 2+2cos(2π/5) is x^2−3x+1 (correction).
- These values already rule out very small periods, but do not yet rigorously disprove periodicity for (A).

Plausible corrected claim (reading B)
- Fix N and q=ζ_N. The OGF suggests \sum_{n≥0} f_n(q)t^n is rational with denominator a power of 1−t^N. If the global denominator reduces to 1−t^N, then n↦f_n(ζ_N) is exactly N-periodic.

Caveats
- The symmetrized q-Pascal recursion involves q^{1/2}; to avoid branch ambiguities at roots of unity, either work in v with q=v^2 (integer exponents) or use the standard q-Pascal identity and convert via the exact factor q^{−k(n−k)/2}.

Next steps
1) Disproving (A): Evaluate f_p(ζ_p) for p=7,11 via the half-sum to see whether values are pairwise distinct across infinitely many primes; aim to certify distinct minimal polynomials.
2) Proving (B): Group the OGF sum over i≡r (mod N) and show each grouped sum has denominator exactly 1−t^N (use ∏_{r=0}^{N−1}(1−t q^r)=1−t^N and telescoping across m). This would yield exact N-periodicity. Alternatively, derive a constant-coefficient linear recurrence for f_n(ζ_N).

Problem clarification and plan (fixed N)
- Task: Fix N and study a_N(n) = f_n(ζ_N) as n varies. Earlier rounds mistakenly analyzed the different problem q = e^{2π i/n} (root order tied to n). The correct setting is now fixed.

Core identities to use
- Symmetric–standard relation: [N;K]_sym(v) = v^{-K(N−K)} [N;K]_q with q=v^2. For our K=2i, K(N−K) is even, so a_N(n) is independent of the sign choice v↦−v for the fixed square root of q.
- q–Lucas at a primitive m-th root (standard Gaussian): Writing X = am + b, Y = cm + d with 0≤b,d<m, we have [X;Y]_q|_{q=ζ_m} = binom(a,c)·[b;d]_q|_{q=ζ_m}.

Immediate consequence: disproof for N=2
- Take q=ζ_2=−1, v^2=q (v=i). By q–Lucas with m=2,
  [n choose k]_{-1} = 0 if n even and k odd; else = binom(⌊n/2⌋, ⌊k/2⌋).
- Thus for odd n=2t+1, the phase v^{-2i(n−i)} = (−1)^{i(n−i)} = 1 for all i, and
  f_n(−1) = ∑_{i=0}^{2t+1} binom(t + ⌊(i+1)/2⌋, i), which is strictly increasing in t (each summand with i≥1 increases when t increases). Numerically: f_3(−1)=5, f_7(−1)=40. Hence the sequence is not periodic; the claimed period ≤ 2N = 4 is contradicted at n=3 vs 7.

Next steps
- Generalize the nonperiodicity argument for other fixed N using q–Lucas with base N. In particular, analyze the subsequence n=tN and the contributions from i multiples of N.
- Cleanly separate notes for the matched-order regime (q=e^{2π i/n}) as a distinct problem variant; do not mix it with the fixed-N analysis.

Disproof of the periodicity claim.

Setup: f_n(q)=\sum_{i=0}^n \qbinom{n+i}{2i}_v with q=v^2 and b=2i even, so \qbinom{a}{b}_v depends only on q. We study a_N(n)=f_n(\zeta_N).

Quick counterexamples:
- N=1: a_1(n)=\sum_i \binom{n+i}{2i}=F_{2n+1}, not periodic.
- N=2 (q=−1): Using the specialization \binom{a}{b}_{−1}=0 if a even, b odd; otherwise \binom{\lfloor a/2\rfloor}{\lfloor b/2\rfloor}, one gets a_2(n)=\sum_{i=0}^n \binom{\lfloor (n+i)/2\rfloor}{i}=F_{n+2}, not periodic (indeed unbounded).

Stronger structure (from residue-class decomposition): For fixed N, writing n=xN+s, one can group i=yN+r and use q-Lucas at q=\zeta_N to factor each summand into a residue-dependent constant times an ordinary binomial \binom{x+y+c}{2y+\delta}. Summing over y yields Fibonacci numbers F_{2x+\cdot}. Consequently, for each residue s the subsequence g_s(x)=a_N(xN+s) satisfies g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)−g_s(x), hence cannot be periodic unless identically zero (and g_0(0)=1). This provides a general nonperiodicity mechanism for all N.

Next steps:
- Formalize the q-Lucas-at-\zeta_N step and write the full recurrence proof.
- Explore periodicity modulo primes (Pisano-type) or closed forms for the coefficients in the decomposition for small N.

Clarified scope: We fix N and study a_N(n)=f_n(ζ_N). The earlier variant with q=ζ_n (order tied to n) is a different problem.

Key reductions:
- Symmetric vs standard Gaussian: for all a≥b≥0, with q=v^2, \qbinom{a}{b}_v = v^{b(b−a)} \qbinom{a}{b}_q. Thus f_n(q)=\sum_{i=0}^n q^{i(i−n)} \binom{n+i}{2i}_q (standard Gaussian).
- At q=ζ_N, write n=xN+s and i=yN+r. Then q^{i(i−n)}=ζ_N^{r(r−s)} depends only on residues. By q-Lucas at ζ_N, \binom{n+i}{2i}_{ζ_N}=\binom{x+y+c}{2y+δ}\,\binom{a_0}{b_0}_{ζ_N}, with δ=⌊2r/N⌋, c=⌊(s+r)/N⌋, a_0=s+r−cN, b_0=2r−δN. The case (δ=0,c=1) gives b_0>a_0 and hence vanishes.
- Fibonacci diagonal sums: S_0(x)=∑_{y≥0} \binom{x+y}{2y}=F_{2x+1}, S_1(x)=∑_{y≥0} \binom{x+y}{2y+1}=F_{2x}. Hence for each residue s, g_s(x):=a_N(xN+s)=A_sF_{2x}+B_sF_{2x+1}+C_sF_{2x+2} with constants A_s,B_s,C_s∈Q(ζ_N).
- Therefore g_s satisfies g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)−g_s(x). In particular, no g_s is periodic unless identically zero.

Counterexample (N=2): Using evaluation at q=−1 (see proofs), for odd n=2t+1 we get a_2(2t+1)=∑_{i=0}^{2t+1} \binom{t+⌊(i+1)/2⌋}{i}, which is strictly increasing in t (e.g., a_2(3)=5, a_2(5)=13). Hence {a_2(n)} is not periodic; the original claim is false.

Next steps: (i) Write a complete proof of q-Lucas at ζ_N and record the residue-class/Fibonacci decomposition rigorously. (ii) Compute A_s,B_s,C_s for small N to illustrate and quantify nonperiodicity. (iii) Optional: study periodicity modulo primes (Pisano-type behavior) using the constant-coefficient recurrence for g_s.

Disproof at fixed root (summary)\n- The fixed-N claim is false. For N=2 (q=−1) we obtain exact formulas: a_2(2t+1)=F_{2t+3}, a_2(2t)=F_{2t−1}. Hence {a_2(n)} is unbounded and not periodic. Numerical check: a_2: 1,2,1,5,2,13,5,34,13,…\n- Simpler also: N=1 gives a_1(n)=∑_{i=0}^n binom(n+i,2i)=F_{2n+1}, already nonperiodic.\n\nKey tools\n- Symmetric–standard Gaussian conversion: [A;K]_v = v^{−K(A−K)} [A\choose K]_{q}, q=v^2.\n- q–Lucas at a root of unity (m=2 here): [2a+b;2c+d]_{−1} = binom(a,c) if (b,d)≠(0,1), else 0.\n- Fibonacci sums: ∑_{j=0}^{t} binom(t+j,t−j) = F_{2t+1}, ∑_{j=0}^{t} binom(t+1+j,t−j) = F_{2t+2}, ∑_{j=0}^{t−1} binom(t+j,t−j−1)=F_{2t}.\n\nRetraction\n- Prior OGF heuristic predicting period N after specialization is incorrect in this context; repeated roots at ζ_N produce polynomial-exponential growth rather than periodicity.\n\nGeneral-N roadmap\n- Using q–Lucas with n=tN+r and i=sN+η, one gets [n+i;2i]_sym(v)=v^{−2η(r−η)}[b;d]_q·binom(t+s+δ,2s+c). The η=0 block contributes ∑_{s=0}^t binom(t+s,2s)=F_{2t+1} with coefficient 1, forcing unbounded growth along n=tN+r. Formalize this to conclude nonperiodicity for all N.\n

Fixed-N analysis and counterexample

- We fix N and study a_N(n)=f_n(ζ_N) where f_n(q)=∑_{i=0}^n \qbinom{n+i}{2i}_v with q=v^2. Because the lower index is even, \qbinom{a}{2i}_v depends only on q.
- Symmetric vs standard: \qbinom{a}{b}_v = v^{b(b−a)} [a;b]_q with q=v^2; hence f_n(q)=∑_{i=0}^n q^{i(i−n)} [n+i;2i]_q.
- q–Lucas at q=ζ_N: Writing n=xN+s and i=yN+r, each summand factors as ζ_N^{r(r−s)}·binom(x+y+c,2y+δ)·[a_0;b_0]_{ζ_N}, where c=⌊(s+r)/N⌋, δ=⌊2r/N⌋, a_0=s+r−cN, b_0=2r−δN. The case (δ=0,c=1) has b_0>a_0 and vanishes. Summing over y gives Fibonacci diagonals, so g_s(x):=a_N(xN+s)=A_sF_{2x}+B_sF_{2x+1}+C_sF_{2x+2}, hence g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)−g_s(x).
- Immediate counterexample (N=2): For odd n=2t+1, the twist (−1)^{i(i−n)}=1 and [n+i;2i]_{−1}=binom(t+⌊(i+1)/2⌋,i), giving a_2(2t+1)=F_{2t+3}. For even n=2t≥2, a_2(2t)=F_{2t−1} (and a_2(0)=1). Thus {a_2(n)} is unbounded and not periodic. Example values: 1,2,1,5,2,13,5,34,⋯ (correcting the earlier mistaken a_2(7)=34, not 40).

Next steps: (i) Write a complete proof of the q–Lucas specialization at ζ_N. (ii) Compute the constants A_s,B_s,C_s for small N to exhibit the recurrence numerically. (iii) Optionally, investigate reductions modulo primes (eventual periodicity).

Clarified scope: We fix N and study a_N(n) = f_n(ζ_N). The earlier variant q = ζ_n (order tied to n) is a different problem and not used here.

Key reductions for fixed N:
- Symmetric vs standard Gaussian: for a≥b≥0 and q=v^2, we have [a;b]_v = v^{b(b−a)} [a;b]_q. Thus f_n(q) = ∑_{i=0}^n q^{i(i−n)} [n+i; 2i]_q.
- At q = ζ_N, writing n = xN + s and i = yN + r, the twist q^{i(i−n)} reduces to ζ_N^{r(r−s)} (residue-dependent). Apply q-Lucas at ζ_N to factor [n+i; 2i]_q into an ordinary binomial in (x,y) and a small Gaussian in residues (s,r). The branch (δ=0,c=1) vanishes since then b_0 > a_0.
- Summing over y yields Fibonacci diagonal sums: S_0(x) = ∑_{y≥0} C(x+y, 2y) = F_{2x+1}, S_1(x) = ∑_{y≥0} C(x+y, 2y+1) = F_{2x}. Consequently, for each residue s, g_s(x):=a_N(xN+s) = A_s F_{2x} + B_s F_{2x+1} + C_s F_{2x+2} with constants A_s,B_s,C_s ∈ Q(ζ_N), so g_s satisfies g_s(x+2) = 3 g_s(x+1) − g_s(x) and is not periodic unless zero (but g_0(0)=1).

Counterexamples:
- N=2: a_2(2t+1)=F_{2t+3}, a_2(2t)=F_{2t−1}; hence {a_2(n)} is unbounded (e.g., 1,2,1,5,2,13,5,34,…) and not periodic.
- N=1: f_n(1)=∑_{i=0}^n C(n+i,2i)=F_{2n+1}, also not periodic.

Corrections: Earlier value a_2(7) was misstated; correct is 34.

Next steps: (i) Write a complete proof of the q-Lucas specialization at q=ζ_N; (ii) compute coefficients A_s,B_s,C_s explicitly for small N to illustrate growth; (iii) optionally, explore periodicity modulo primes using the constant-coefficient recurrence for each residue subsequence.

Uniform nonperiodicity at fixed N via residue classes

Setup: For a formal parameter v, define [m]_v=(v^m−v^{−m})/(v−v^{−1}) and [a;b]_v=(product [a]⋯[a−b+1])/(product [b]⋯[1]). Let q=v^2. The symmetric–standard conversion gives [a;b]_v = v^{b(b−a)} [a;b]_q (standard Gaussian). Thus f_n(q)=∑_{i=0}^n q^{i(i−n)} [n+i;2i]_q.

q‑Lucas at q=ζ_N: Write n=xN+s and i=yN+r with 0≤s,r<N. Let c=⌊(s+r)/N⌋, δ=⌊2r/N⌋, a_0=s+r−cN, b_0=2r−δN. Then at q=ζ_N,
[n+i;2i]_q = 0 if b_0>a_0, and otherwise equals C(x+y+c, 2y+δ)·[a_0;b_0]_q. The twist simplifies to q^{i(i−n)}=ζ_N^{r(r−s)}.

Summing over y: Using the diagonal identities S_0(x)=∑_{y≥0} C(x+y,2y)=F_{2x+1} and S_1(x)=∑_{y≥0} C(x+y,2y+1)=F_{2x}, we get for each residue s
  g_s(x):=a_N(xN+s)=A_s F_{2x}+B_s F_{2x+1}+C_s F_{2x+2},
with constants A_s,B_s,C_s in Q(ζ_N) depending only on (N,s). Hence g_s satisfies g_s(x+2)=3 g_s(x+1)−g_s(x) and is not periodic unless zero. Since g_0(0)=1, a global period cannot exist.

Concrete s=0 formula: For s=0, only r=0 and r in {⌈N/2⌉,…,N−1} contribute. One finds
  a_N(xN)=F_{2x+1} + C_N F_{2x},
with C_N = ∑_{r=⌈N/2⌉}^{N−1} ζ_N^{r^2} [r;2r−N]_{ζ_N}. This exhibits an explicit nonperiodic second‑order recurrence along n=xN.

Examples: N=2 gives C_2=−1 and a_2(2x)=F_{2x−1}. N=3 gives C_3=−1 and a_3(3x)=F_{2x+1}−F_{2x}.

Next steps: (i) Formalize the q‑Lucas-at-ζ_N lemma in proofs.md; (ii) record the n=xN proposition; (iii) compute A_s,B_s,C_s for small N and s; (iv) explore periodicity modulo primes using the fixed second‑order recurrences.

Main result: the fixed-root periodicity claim is false

Definitions. For a formal parameter v, set [m]_v=(v^m−v^{−m})/(v−v^{−1}) and [A;B]_v=([A]_v⋯[A−B+1]_v)/([B]_v⋯[1]_v), with the usual conventions. Let q=v^2 and define f_n(q)=∑_{i=0}^n [n+i; 2i]_v. For fixed N≥1, write ζ_N=e^{2πi/N} and a_N(n)=f_n(ζ_N).

Theorem (counterexample at N=2). For N=2 (q=−1), the sequence a_2(n)=f_n(−1) is not periodic. In fact, for t≥0,
- a_2(2t+1)=F_{2t+3},
- a_2(2t)=F_{2t−1} (with a_2(0)=1=F_{−1}),
where F_k denotes the Fibonacci sequence (F_0=0, F_1=1, F_{k+1}=F_k+F_{k−1}). Thus {a_2(n)} is unbounded; for example a_2(1)=2, a_2(3)=5, a_2(5)=13, a_2(7)=34.

Proof. Relate the symmetric and standard Gaussian coefficients: for all a≥b≥0 and q=v^2,
  [a;b]_v = v^{b(b−a)} [a;b]_q.
Hence
  f_n(−1)=∑_{i=0}^n (−1)^{i(i−n)} [n+i;2i]_q|_{q=−1}.
At q=−1, the standard Gaussian specializes as follows: for 0≤k≤n,
  [n;k]_q|_{q=−1}=0 if n is even and k is odd, and otherwise equals C(⌊n/2⌋, ⌊k/2⌋).
This is proved by induction from the q-Pascal recursion [n;k]_q=[n−1;k]_q+q^{n−k}[n−1;k−1]_q.
For odd n=2t+1, the sign factor is 1 since i(i−n) is even, so
  a_2(2t+1)=∑_{j=0}^t C(t+j, 2j) + ∑_{j=0}^t C(t+j+1, 2j+1) = F_{2t+1}+F_{2t+2}=F_{2t+3}.
For even n=2t, the sign factor is (−1)^i, giving
  a_2(2t)=∑_{j=0}^t C(t+j, 2j) − ∑_{j=0}^{t−1} C(t+j, 2j+1) = F_{2t+1}−F_{2t}=F_{2t−1}.
The Fibonacci equalities follow from the standard diagonal-sum identities ∑_{y≥0} C(x+y, 2y)=F_{2x+1} and ∑_{y≥0} C(x+y, 2y+1)=F_{2x}. Therefore a_2 is not periodic, and the general claim of periodicity (e.g., with period dividing 2N) is false. ∎


=== Round 1 Summary ===

This round fixes the interpretation (fixed N, q=ζ_N) and disproves the claimed periodicity. Key reductions: convert symmetrized q-binomials to standard ones (factor q^{i(i−n)}), derive the n-OGF ∑_n f_n(q)t^n = ∑_{i≥0} t^i/∏_{s=−i}^i(1−t q^s), and group indices via n=xN+s, i=yN+r. Applying q–Lucas at q=ζ_N factors each summand; summing over y gives diagonal binomial sums equal to Fibonacci numbers (S_0(x)=F_{2x+1}, S_1(x)=F_{2x}). Hence each residue subsequence g_s(x)=a_N(xN+s) is a linear combination of Fibonacci terms and satisfies the linear recurrence g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)−g_s(x). Therefore g_s cannot be periodic unless identically zero. Explicit counterexamples: N=1 yields a_1(n)=F_{2n+1}, N=2 yields a_2(n)=F_{n+2}; both unbounded.

=== Round 2 Summary ===

This round fixes the scope (fixed N, q=ζ_N) and disproves the periodicity claim. Main reductions: convert symmetrized q-binomials to standard ones so f_n(q)=∑_{i=0}^n q^{i(i−n)} binom_q(n+i,2i), and record the n-OGF ∑_n f_n(q)t^n = ∑_{i≥0} t^i/∏_{s=−i}^i(1−t q^s). Writing n=xN+s and i=yN+r and applying q–Lucas at q=ζ_N factors each summand; summing over y yields diagonal binomial sums equal to Fibonacci numbers. Hence each residue subsequence g_s(x)=a_N(xN+s) equals A_s F_{2x}+B_s F_{2x+1}+C_s F_{2x+2} and satisfies g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)−g_s(x), so is not periodic unless identically zero. Concrete counterexamples: N=1 gives F_{2n+1}; N=2 gives a_2(2t+1)=F_{2t+3}, a_2(2t)=F_{2t−1}, so {a_N(n)} is unbounded and nonperiodic. Citations: Research Notes; Rigorous Proofs; Current Output.


=== Round 3 Summary ===

Fixed the problem to the fixed‑N case (q=ζ_N). By converting symmetrized to standard q‑binomials and applying q‑Lucas at q=ζ_N with n=xN+s, i=yN+r, the sum over y produces diagonal binomial sums equal to Fibonacci numbers. Therefore each residue subsequence g_s(x)=a_N(xN+s) is a linear combination A_s F_{2x}+B_s F_{2x+1}+C_s F_{2x+2} and satisfies the recurrence g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)−g_s(x). Hence no nontrivial residue subsequence is periodic; in particular the sequence a_N(n) is not periodic in n. Concrete checks: N=1 gives a_1(n)=F_{2n+1}; N=2 gives a_2(2t+1)=F_{2t+3}, a_2(2t)=F_{2t−1}. Conclusion: the periodicity claim is false. Citations: Research Notes; Rigorous Proofs.


=== Previous Round Feedback ===

Status: The fixed-root periodicity claim is false. The current output provides a clean, rigorous N=2 counterexample (a_2(2t+1)=F_{2t+3}, a_2(2t)=F_{2t−1}), which already refutes the claim. Good correction of the earlier numeric slip (a_2(7)=34).

Prover 1: Your reduction from symmetric to standard Gaussians is correct, and the residue-class decomposition using q‑Lucas at q=ζ_N is sound. The Fibonacci diagonal-sum identities are correct and justify that for each residue s, g_s(x)=a_N(xN+s) is a fixed linear combination of F_{2x}, F_{2x+1}, F_{2x+2}, hence satisfies g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)−g_s(x). This rules out period 2N (indeed any period) as long as some g_s is nonzero (g_0(0)=1). Please add a fully detailed statement and proof of q‑Lucas at a primitive N‑th root (you sketched the valuation argument), and explicitly state why the branch (δ=0,c=1) vanishes (b_0>a_0).

Prover 2: This round’s argument focusing on the subsequence n=xN is strong. The formula a_N(xN)=F_{2x+1}+C_N F_{2x}, with C_N=∑_{r=⌈N/2⌉}^{N−1} ζ_N^{r^2}[r;2r−N]_{ζ_N}, is correct and immediately gives a nonperiodic second-order recurrence. Your identification of the flaw in the earlier P_m(x;v) parity telescoping is helpful. Retain only the corrected residue-class approach.

Prover 3: Good emphasis on well-posedness (v↦−v invariance for even lower index) and a clear uniform nonperiodicity proof for the s=0 subsequence. Your N=3 correction is consistent with the general formula. Avoid mixing with the varying-root problem; keep focus on fixed N.

Next steps: (i) Write a complete proof of q‑Lucas at q=ζ_N in proofs.md (single-digit version suffices). (ii) Record the uniform n=xN formula and the resulting recurrence as a proposition, with explicit C_N. (iii) Optionally compute A_s,B_s,C_s for small N and s to illustrate the general residue-class decomposition. (iv) Explore reductions modulo primes (Pisano-type periodicity) using the constant-coefficient recurrence for each residue subsequence.
