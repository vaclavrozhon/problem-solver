For every N\u22651, the sequence a_N(n)=f_n(\u03b6_N) is not periodic in n.\\nProof. If a_N were P-periodic, then each residue subsequence g_s(x)=a_N(xN+s) would be periodic. Let M=[3 \u22121; 1 0]. The recurrence gives [g_s(x+1),g_s(x)]^T=M^x [g_s(1),g_s(0)]^T. Periodicity with period T implies M^T v=v for v=[g_s(1),g_s(0)]^T\u22600. The eigenvalues of M are \u03bb_{\u00b1}=(3\u00b1\u221a5)/2, neither a root of unity; thus 1 is not an eigenvalue of M^T.

For s=0, c(r)=0 for all r. The r=0 term contributes F_{2x+1}. For 1\u2264r\u2264\u230a(N\u22121)/2\u230b, b_0=2r>a_0=r so those terms vanish.
