From (2) with n = xN, write i = yN + r (0 \u2264 r < N). Then q^{i(i\u2212n)}|_{q=\u03b6} = \u03b6^{r^2}.

If \u03b4 = 1 (i.e., r \u2265 \u2308N/2\u2309), the contribution equals \\\\binom{r}{2r\u2212N}_q|_{q=\u03b6} times \u2211_{y=0}^{x\u22121} \\\\binom{x+y}{2y+1} = F_{2x}. Summing over r gives (9). \u220e\\n\\nExamples (C_N values)\\n- N = 1: C_1 = 0, so f_x(1) = F_{2x+1}.\\n- N = 2: r = 1 only, C_2 = \u03b6_2 \u00b7 [1;0]_q = \u22121, so f_{2x}(\u22121) = F_{2x+1} \u2212 F_{2x} = F_{2x\u22121}. This agrees with the explicit formulas a_2(2t) = F_{2t\u22121}, a_2(2t+1) = F_{2t+3}.\\n- N = 3: r = 2 only, C_3 = \u03b6_3^{4} [2;1]_q|_{q=\u03b6_3} = \u03b6_3 (1+\u03b6_3) = \u22121, so f_{3x}(\u03b6_3) = F_{2x+1} \u2212 F_{2x}.\\n- N = 4: r \u2208 {2,3}, C_4 = 1\u00b7[2;0] + \u03b6_4^{9} [3;2]|_{q=\u03b6_4} = 1 + i\u00b7(1+i+i^2) = 0, hence f_{4x}(\u03b6_4) = F_{2x+1}.\\n- N = 5: r \u2208 {3,4}, C_5 = 2 cos(2\u03c0/5), so f_{5x}(\u03b6_5) = F_{2x+1} + 2 cos(2\u03c0/5) F_{2x}.\\n\\nGeneral residue subsequences\\nFor 0 \u2264 s < N, write n = xN + s. The same decomposition with i = yN + r and Lemma 1 gives c := \u230a(s+r)/N\u230b \u2208 {0,1} and \u03b4 := \u230a2r/N\u230b \u2208 {0,1}. The case (\u03b4,c) = (0,1) vanishes (since then 2r > s+r). The three nonvanishing cases contribute F_{2x+1} (\u03b4=c=0), F_{2x} (\u03b4=1,c=0), and F_{2x+2} (\u03b4=c=1) with coefficients in Q(\u03b6_N) depending only on (N,s) via \u03b6^{r(r\u2212s)} \\\\binom{s+r\u2212cN}{2r\u2212\u03b4N}_q|_{q=\u03b6}.

The q-Pochhammer asymptotics provide a clean and rigorous proof of the q-Lucas specialization and the ensuing Fibonacci structure.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Extract explicit closed forms for A_s,B_s,C_s for small N and s to illustrate (10) numerically.\\n- Investigate reductions modulo primes p (Pisano-type periodicity) using the linear recurrence (11).\\n- Explore further algebraic properties of C_N (e.g., reality for odd N, bounds, or Galois conjugacy) via pairing arguments on the r-sum in (8).\\n\\nConclusion\\n- For every fixed N \u2265 1, the subsequence n = xN satisfies f_{xN}(\u03b6_N) = F_{2x+1} + C_N F_{2x}, hence is unbounded. Therefore the fixed-root periodicity claim is false. The general residue-class formula (10) exhibits a uniform order-2 linear recurrence, further excluding periodicity.\"}",
