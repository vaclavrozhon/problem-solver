Ideas
- Provide a rigorous q-Lucas specialization for Gaussian polynomials at a primitive N-th root of unity. This is the key structural lemma justifying the residue-class factorization used throughout our analysis.
- Use it to derive an exact closed form for the subsequence n = xN: f_{xN}(ζ_N) = F_{2x+1} + C_N F_{2x}, which is unbounded and hence disproves periodicity for fixed N.
- Record the general residue-class decomposition n = xN + s, which yields a fixed linear combination of F_{2x}, F_{2x+1}, F_{2x+2} for each s, giving a uniform second-order recurrence and further obstructing periodicity.

Symmetric–standard conversion
For q = v^2 and integers a ≥ b ≥ 0,

(1)  \qbinom{a}{b}_v = v^{b(b−a)} \binom{a}{b}_q,

so with b = 2i we can write

(2)  f_n(q) = ∑_{i=0}^{n} q^{i(i−n)} \binom{n+i}{2i}_q.

q-Pochhammer notation and Gaussian polynomials
Let (q;q)_0 = 1 and (q;q)_m = ∏_{t=1}^{m} (1 − q^t). Then

(3)  \binom{n}{k}_q = \frac{(q;q)_n}{(q;q)_k (q;q)_{n−k}}.

Lemma 1 (q-Lucas specialization at ζ_N). Fix N ≥ 1 and let ζ = ζ_N be a primitive N-th root of unity. Write n = aN + b and k = cN + d with a,c ≥ 0 and 0 ≤ b,d < N. Then

(4)  \binom{n}{k}_q\Big|_{q=ζ} = \begin{cases} \binom{a}{c}\, \binom{b}{d}_q\Big|_{q=ζ}, & d ≤ b,\\ 0, & d > b. \end{cases}

Proof. Consider q = ζ e^{t} with t → 0. Using (3), expand each (q;q)_{aN+b} as

(q;q)_{aN+b} = ∏_{s=1}^{a} (1 − q^{sN}) · ∏_{s=1}^{a} ∏_{r=1}^{N−1} (1 − q^{(s−1)N + r}) · ∏_{r=1}^{b} (1 − q^{aN + r}).

As t → 0, for multiples of N we have 1 − q^{sN} = 1 − e^{sNt} ∼ −sN t, while for exponents not divisible by N we get 1 − q^{(s−1)N + r} → 1 − ζ^{r}, and similarly 1 − q^{aN + r} → 1 − ζ^{r}. Thus

(q;q)_{aN+b} ∼ [ (−Nt)^a a! ] · [ ∏_{r=1}^{N−1} (1 − ζ^{r})^a ] · [ ∏_{r=1}^{b} (1 − ζ^{r}) ].

Applying this to (q;q)_n, (q;q)_k, (q;q)_{n−k} and taking the ratio (3) yields

\binom{n}{k}_q\Big|_{q→ζ} = \frac{a!}{c!(a−c)!} · \frac{∏_{r=1}^{b} (1 − ζ^{r})}{∏_{r=1}^{d} (1 − ζ^{r}) · ∏_{r=1}^{b−d} (1 − ζ^{r})},

provided d ≤ b; if d > b, the denominator contains more factors than the numerator in the last product, forcing the limit to be 0. Since for 0 ≤ b,d < N no factor 1 − ζ^{r} with r ≡ 0 occurs, this equals

\binom{a}{c} · \binom{b}{d}_q\Big|_{q=ζ}.

Because \binom{n}{k}_q is a polynomial in q, the radial limit equals its value at q = ζ, proving (4). ∎

Diagonal binomial sums and OGFs
Define F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1, F_{n+1} = F_n + F_{n−1}. For x ≥ 0,

(5)  ∑_{y=0}^{x} \binom{x+y}{2y} = F_{2x+1},
(6)  ∑_{y=0}^{x−1} \binom{x+y}{2y+1} = F_{2x},
(7)  ∑_{y=0}^{x} \binom{x+y+1}{2y+1} = F_{2x+2}.

Proof. Use ∑_{m≥0} \binom{m+s}{s} t^m = 1/(1−t)^{s+1} and sum over y ≥ 0. The OGFs are (1−t)/(1−3t+t^2), t/(1−3t+t^2), and 1/(1−3t+t^2), respectively. ∎

Main theorem (subsequence n = xN). For any fixed N ≥ 1 and ζ = ζ_N, there exists a constant

(8)  C_N = ∑_{r=\lceil N/2\rceil}^{N−1} ζ^{r^2} \binom{r}{2r−N}_q\Big|_{q=ζ} ∈ \mathbb{Q}(ζ)

such that for all x ≥ 0,

(9)  f_{xN}(ζ) = F_{2x+1} + C_N F_{2x}.

In particular, {f_{xN}(ζ)}_{x≥0} is strictly increasing for large x and hence unbounded; therefore {a_N(n)}_{n≥0} is not periodic.

Proof. From (2) with n = xN, write i = yN + r (0 ≤ r < N). Then q^{i(i−n)}|_{q=ζ} = ζ^{r^2}. By Lemma 1 with b = r and d = 2r, we have δ := ⌊2r/N⌋ ∈ {0,1} and

\binom{xN + yN + r}{2yN + 2r}_q\Big|_{q=ζ} = \binom{x+y}{2y + δ} · \binom{r}{2r − δN}_q\Big|_{q=ζ}.

If δ = 0 (i.e., 2r < N), then \binom{r}{2r}_q = 0 unless r = 0, in which case the contribution is ∑_{y=0}^{x} \binom{x+y}{2y} = F_{2x+1}. If δ = 1 (i.e., r ≥ ⌈N/2⌉), the contribution equals \binom{r}{2r−N}_q|_{q=ζ} times ∑_{y=0}^{x−1} \binom{x+y}{2y+1} = F_{2x}. Summing over r gives (9). ∎

Examples (C_N values)
- N = 1: C_1 = 0, so f_x(1) = F_{2x+1}.
- N = 2: r = 1 only, C_2 = ζ_2 · [1;0]_q = −1, so f_{2x}(−1) = F_{2x+1} − F_{2x} = F_{2x−1}. This agrees with the explicit formulas a_2(2t) = F_{2t−1}, a_2(2t+1) = F_{2t+3}.
- N = 3: r = 2 only, C_3 = ζ_3^{4} [2;1]_q|_{q=ζ_3} = ζ_3 (1+ζ_3) = −1, so f_{3x}(ζ_3) = F_{2x+1} − F_{2x}.
- N = 4: r ∈ {2,3}, C_4 = 1·[2;0] + ζ_4^{9} [3;2]|_{q=ζ_4} = 1 + i·(1+i+i^2) = 0, hence f_{4x}(ζ_4) = F_{2x+1}.
- N = 5: r ∈ {3,4}, C_5 = 2 cos(2π/5), so f_{5x}(ζ_5) = F_{2x+1} + 2 cos(2π/5) F_{2x}.

General residue subsequences
For 0 ≤ s < N, write n = xN + s. The same decomposition with i = yN + r and Lemma 1 gives c := ⌊(s+r)/N⌋ ∈ {0,1} and δ := ⌊2r/N⌋ ∈ {0,1}. The case (δ,c) = (0,1) vanishes (since then 2r > s+r). The three nonvanishing cases contribute F_{2x+1} (δ=c=0), F_{2x} (δ=1,c=0), and F_{2x+2} (δ=c=1) with coefficients in Q(ζ_N) depending only on (N,s) via ζ^{r(r−s)} \binom{s+r−cN}{2r−δN}_q|_{q=ζ}. Thus there exist A_s,B_s,C_s ∈ Q(ζ_N) with

(10) f_{xN+s}(ζ_N) = A_s F_{2x} + B_s F_{2x+1} + C_s F_{2x+2}  (x ≥ 0).

Consequently each residue subsequence satisfies the second-order recurrence

(11) g_s(x+2) = 3 g_s(x+1) − g_s(x),

and in particular is not periodic unless identically zero (but g_0(0) = f_0(ζ_N) = 1).

Obstacles addressed
- The earlier parity/product telescoping approach was flawed; it incorrectly predicted periodicity and contradicts explicit N=2 computations. The q-Pochhammer asymptotics provide a clean and rigorous proof of the q-Lucas specialization and the ensuing Fibonacci structure.

Next steps
- Extract explicit closed forms for A_s,B_s,C_s for small N and s to illustrate (10) numerically.
- Investigate reductions modulo primes p (Pisano-type periodicity) using the linear recurrence (11).
- Explore further algebraic properties of C_N (e.g., reality for odd N, bounds, or Galois conjugacy) via pairing arguments on the r-sum in (8).

Conclusion
- For every fixed N ≥ 1, the subsequence n = xN satisfies f_{xN}(ζ_N) = F_{2x+1} + C_N F_{2x}, hence is unbounded. Therefore the fixed-root periodicity claim is false. The general residue-class formula (10) exhibits a uniform order-2 linear recurrence, further excluding periodicity.
