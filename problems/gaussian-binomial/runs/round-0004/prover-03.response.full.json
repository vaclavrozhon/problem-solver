The current output correctly disproves it for N=2 via an explicit Fibonacci evaluation. This suffices to refute the general claim. There is, however, room to strengthen and clean up the writeup, remove unsupported heuristics, and add missing proofs.\\n- A uniform argument shows nonperiodicity for every fixed N by analyzing the subsequence n=xN. This should be promoted to the main results, with a short proof using q\u2013Lucas at q=\u03b6_N and diagonal Fibonacci sums.\\n\\nWhat is correct and clear\\n- The conversion from symmetric to standard Gaussian coefficients is used: [a;b]_v = v^{b(b\u2212a)} [a;b]_q with q=v^2. This is the key identity that eliminates v^{1/2}-ambiguity. It is correct and easily proved (see Lemma 1 below).\\n- The N=2 counterexample is clean and rigorous: a_2(2t+1)=F_{2t+3}, a_2(2t)=F_{2t\u22121}. This alone refutes periodicity.\\n\\nIssues and gaps\\n1) Missing independence-from-v lemma. Since the lower index is even (2i), each summand depends only on q=v^2. While implicitly used, this should be stated and proved once.\\n2) Symmetric\u2013standard conversion is cited but not proved. Include a brief proof (one line suffices) so the writeup is self-contained.\\n3) Specialization at q=\u22121. The lemma [n;k]_{q}|_{q=\u22121} equals 0 when n even and k odd and otherwise equals C(\u230an/2\u230b,\u230ak/2\u230b) is only outlined. Provide a short inductive proof from q-Pascal, or a reference.\\n4) Diagonal Fibonacci sums. The identities \u2211_{y=0}^{x} C(x+y,2y)=F_{2x+1} and \u2211_{y=0}^{x\u22121} C(x+y,2y+1)=F_{2x} are used but not proved. Include a quick inductive proof or generating-function derivation.\\n5) Inconsistency in summaries. Some earlier summaries claimed a_2(n)=F_{n+2}. These should be corrected to the piecewise formulas a_2(2t+1)=F_{2t+3}, a_2(2t)=F_{2t\u22121}.\\n6) Unnatural notation F_{\u22121}. The line \u201ca_2(0)=1=F_{\u22121}\u201d is avoidable; either state the even-formula for t\u22651 and separately a_2(0)=1, or define the backward Fibonacci extension explicitly.\\n7) Unsupported heuristics. The OGF heuristic suggesting denominator (1\u2212t^N)^k and exact N-periodicity should be removed; it contradicts the proven growth along n=xN.\\n8) Mixing two problem variants. The Notes still mix the varying-root problem (q=\u03b6_n) with the fixed-root problem. Keep only the fixed-N analysis; move the varying-root computations to a separate note, clearly labeled as a different problem.\\n\\nRigorous additions (to proofs.md)\\nLemma 1 (independence from the square root). For 0\u2264b\u2264a, [a;b]_{\u2212v}=(\u22121)^{b(a\u2212b)}[a;b]_v. In particular, when b is even, [a;b]_v depends only on q=v^2.\\nProof. Since [m]_{\u2212v}=(\u22121)^{m\u22121}[m]_v, the exponent in the numerator is \u2211_{j=0}^{b\u22121} ((a\u2212j)\u22121)=b(a\u2212(b+1)/2), while in the denominator it is \u2211_{j=1}^{b}(j\u22121)=b(b\u22121)/2. Their difference is b(a\u2212b), giving the stated factor.\\n\\nLemma 2 (symmetric\u2013standard conversion). With q=v^2 we have [a;b]_v = v^{b(b\u2212a)} [a;b]_q.\\nProof. Note [m]_v=(v^m\u2212v^{\u2212m})/(v\u2212v^{\u22121})=v^{\u2212m+1}(v^{2m}\u22121)/(v^2\u22121)=v^{\u2212m+1}[m]_q. Multiply these factors across numerator and denominator of [a;b]_v to get v^{b^2\u2212ab}[a;b]_q.\\n\\nLemma 3 (specialization at q=\u22121). For 0\u2264k\u2264n,\\n[n;k]_q|_{q=\u22121}=\\n- 0 if n is even and k is odd;\\n- C(\u230an/2\u230b, \u230ak/2\u230b) otherwise.\\nProof. Induct on n using q-Pascal: [n;k]_q=[n\u22121;k]_q+q^{n\u2212k}[n\u22121;k\u22121]_q. Substitute q=\u22121, split cases by the parity of n and k, and check that the claimed formula satisfies the same recursion with matching initial conditions.\\n\\nLemma 4 (diagonal Fibonacci sums). For x\u22650,\\n- \u2211_{y=0}^{x} C(x+y, 2y)=F_{2x+1},\\n- \u2211_{y=0}^{x\u22121} C(x+y, 2y+1)=F_{2x}.\\nProof. Either use generating functions: \u2211_{x\u22650}(\u2211_{y=0}^x C(x+y,2y)) t^x = \u2211_{y\u22650} t^y/(1\u2212t)^{2y+1}=(1\u2212t)/(1\u22123t+t^2), which is the OGF of (F_{2x+1})_{x\u22650}; similarly for the odd diagonal. Or proceed by induction using Pascal identities.\\n\\nUniform nonperiodicity for all N (to output.md)\\nProposition. Fix N\u22651 and set g(x)=a_N(xN)=f_{xN}(\u03b6_N). Then there exists a constant C_N\u2208\u211a(\u03b6_N) such that\\n  g(x)=F_{2x+1}+C_N F_{2x}  for all x\u22650.\\nIn particular, g satisfies g(x+2)=3g(x+1)\u2212g(x) with g(0)=1, hence is unbounded and not periodic. Therefore {a_N(n)} is not periodic for any N.\\nProof. Using Lemma 2 and q=\u03b6_N,\\n  f_{xN}(q)=\u2211_{i=0}^{xN} q^{i(i\u2212xN)} [xN+i; 2i]_q.\\nWrite i=yN+r with y\u22650 and 0\u2264r\u2264N\u22121. Then q^{i(i\u2212xN)}=\u03b6_N^{r^2}. Apply q\u2013Lucas at q=\u03b6_N (standard result; equivalently, [am+b;cm+d]_q\u2261C(a,c)[b;d]_q mod \u03a6_N(q), hence equality at q=\u03b6_N):\\n- If r=0, then [xN+yN;2yN]_q|_{q=\u03b6_N}=C(x+y,2y), giving \u2211_{y=0}^{x} C(x+y,2y)=F_{2x+1} by Lemma 4.\\n- If 0<r<N/2, then 2r< N, so the residue-small Gaussian is [r;2r]=0 and this block vanishes.\\n- If N/2\u2264r\u2264N\u22121, then the carry gives [xN+yN+r;2yN+2r]_q|_{q=\u03b6_N}=C(x+y,2y+1)[r;2r\u2212N]_{\u03b6_N}, with y ranging 0\u2264y\u2264x\u22121. Summing over y yields F_{2x} by Lemma 4. The r-block contributes w_r F_{2x} with w_r:=\u03b6_N^{r^2}[r;2r\u2212N]_{\u03b6_N}.\\nCollecting the r=0 and r\u2265N/2 blocks gives g(x)=F_{2x+1}+C_N F_{2x} where C_N=\u2211_{r=\u2308N/2\u2309}^{N\u22121} w_r. As F_{2x} and F_{2x+1} satisfy the same second-order recurrence, so does g, and g(0)=1. The characteristic roots (3\u00b1\u221a5)/2 have modulus \u22601, so the only periodic solution is the zero sequence; g is nonzero, hence nonperiodic and unbounded. \u220e\\n\\nExample checks (consistency and sanity)\\n- N=2: C_2=\u03b6_2^{1}[1;0]_{\u22121}=\u22121, so g(x)=F_{2x+1}\u2212F_{2x}=F_{2x\u22121}, matching the even-index formula in the N=2 theorem.\\n- N=3: C_3=\u03b6_3^{4}[2;1]_{\u03b6_3}=\u03b6_3(1+\u03b6_3)=\u03b6_3+\u03b6_3^2=\u22121, so g(x)=F_{2x+1}\u2212F_{2x}. In particular, a_3(3)=2\u22121=1 and a_3(6)=5\u22123=2.\\n- N=4: r\u2208{2,3} gives w_2=1 and w_3=\u03b6_4^{9}[3;2]_{i}=i\u00b7(1+i\u22121)=\u22121, hence C_4=0 and g(x)=F_{2x+1}.\\n\\nSpecific edits to improve rigor and clarity\\n- Add Lemmas 1\u20134 (with short proofs) to proofs.md.\\n- Add the uniform Proposition to output.md as the main structural result; this immediately implies nonperiodicity for all N and explains the phenomenon.\\n- Correct all occurrences of the erroneous statement a_2(n)=F_{n+2} (e.g., in Round 1 Summary). Replace with the piecewise formulas or with the uniform subsequence formula when n is a multiple of N.\\n- Remove the OGF-based periodicity heuristic; it is unsupported and contradicted by the Proposition.\\n- Keep the varying-root discussion (q=\u03b6_n) separate from the fixed-root problem or omit it here.\\n- Replace \u201ca_2(0)=1=F_{\u22121}\u201d with a_2(0)=1 and the even-index formula for t\u22651, or explicitly define backward Fibonacci if you wish to keep that identity.\\n\\nNext steps (optional positive directions)\\n- Compute C_N explicitly for small N and record the first few values of a_N(xN)=F_{2x+1}+C_N F_{2x} to illustrate growth and nonperiodicity.\\n- Generalize to residues s\u22600: show a_N(xN+s)=A_s F_{2x}+B_s F_{2x+1}+C_s F_{2x+2} with constants in \u211a(\u03b6_N), by the same residue-class decomposition; record the common recurrence g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)\u2212g_s(x).\\n- Explore reductions modulo primes for these recurrences (Pisano-type periodicity). This is a plausible, rigorous replacement for the original (false) periodicity claim.\\n\\nSummary\\n- The current N=2 disproof is correct. To make the writeup rigorous and complete, add the independence-from-v lemma, the symmetric\u2013standard conversion proof, the q=\u22121 specialization lemma, and the diagonal Fibonacci sums. Promote a uniform nonperiodicity proposition along n=xN to output.md, and remove unsupported OGF periodicity heuristics. Correct minor inconsistencies (a_2(n)=F_{n+2}, F_{\u22121}). These edits will yield a self-contained, clear refutation together with informative structural insight valid for all N.\"}",
