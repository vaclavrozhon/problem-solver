Audit of the current writeup and actionable improvements

Overview
- The fixed-root periodicity claim is false. The current output correctly disproves it for N=2 via an explicit Fibonacci evaluation. This suffices to refute the general claim. There is, however, room to strengthen and clean up the writeup, remove unsupported heuristics, and add missing proofs.
- A uniform argument shows nonperiodicity for every fixed N by analyzing the subsequence n=xN. This should be promoted to the main results, with a short proof using q–Lucas at q=ζ_N and diagonal Fibonacci sums.

What is correct and clear
- The conversion from symmetric to standard Gaussian coefficients is used: [a;b]_v = v^{b(b−a)} [a;b]_q with q=v^2. This is the key identity that eliminates v^{1/2}-ambiguity. It is correct and easily proved (see Lemma 1 below).
- The N=2 counterexample is clean and rigorous: a_2(2t+1)=F_{2t+3}, a_2(2t)=F_{2t−1}. This alone refutes periodicity.

Issues and gaps
1) Missing independence-from-v lemma. Since the lower index is even (2i), each summand depends only on q=v^2. While implicitly used, this should be stated and proved once.
2) Symmetric–standard conversion is cited but not proved. Include a brief proof (one line suffices) so the writeup is self-contained.
3) Specialization at q=−1. The lemma [n;k]_{q}|_{q=−1} equals 0 when n even and k odd and otherwise equals C(⌊n/2⌋,⌊k/2⌋) is only outlined. Provide a short inductive proof from q-Pascal, or a reference.
4) Diagonal Fibonacci sums. The identities ∑_{y=0}^{x} C(x+y,2y)=F_{2x+1} and ∑_{y=0}^{x−1} C(x+y,2y+1)=F_{2x} are used but not proved. Include a quick inductive proof or generating-function derivation.
5) Inconsistency in summaries. Some earlier summaries claimed a_2(n)=F_{n+2}. These should be corrected to the piecewise formulas a_2(2t+1)=F_{2t+3}, a_2(2t)=F_{2t−1}.
6) Unnatural notation F_{−1}. The line “a_2(0)=1=F_{−1}” is avoidable; either state the even-formula for t≥1 and separately a_2(0)=1, or define the backward Fibonacci extension explicitly.
7) Unsupported heuristics. The OGF heuristic suggesting denominator (1−t^N)^k and exact N-periodicity should be removed; it contradicts the proven growth along n=xN.
8) Mixing two problem variants. The Notes still mix the varying-root problem (q=ζ_n) with the fixed-root problem. Keep only the fixed-N analysis; move the varying-root computations to a separate note, clearly labeled as a different problem.

Rigorous additions (to proofs.md)
Lemma 1 (independence from the square root). For 0≤b≤a, [a;b]_{−v}=(−1)^{b(a−b)}[a;b]_v. In particular, when b is even, [a;b]_v depends only on q=v^2.
Proof. Since [m]_{−v}=(−1)^{m−1}[m]_v, the exponent in the numerator is ∑_{j=0}^{b−1} ((a−j)−1)=b(a−(b+1)/2), while in the denominator it is ∑_{j=1}^{b}(j−1)=b(b−1)/2. Their difference is b(a−b), giving the stated factor.

Lemma 2 (symmetric–standard conversion). With q=v^2 we have [a;b]_v = v^{b(b−a)} [a;b]_q.
Proof. Note [m]_v=(v^m−v^{−m})/(v−v^{−1})=v^{−m+1}(v^{2m}−1)/(v^2−1)=v^{−m+1}[m]_q. Multiply these factors across numerator and denominator of [a;b]_v to get v^{b^2−ab}[a;b]_q.

Lemma 3 (specialization at q=−1). For 0≤k≤n,
[n;k]_q|_{q=−1}=
- 0 if n is even and k is odd;
- C(⌊n/2⌋, ⌊k/2⌋) otherwise.
Proof. Induct on n using q-Pascal: [n;k]_q=[n−1;k]_q+q^{n−k}[n−1;k−1]_q. Substitute q=−1, split cases by the parity of n and k, and check that the claimed formula satisfies the same recursion with matching initial conditions.

Lemma 4 (diagonal Fibonacci sums). For x≥0,
- ∑_{y=0}^{x} C(x+y, 2y)=F_{2x+1},
- ∑_{y=0}^{x−1} C(x+y, 2y+1)=F_{2x}.
Proof. Either use generating functions: ∑_{x≥0}(∑_{y=0}^x C(x+y,2y)) t^x = ∑_{y≥0} t^y/(1−t)^{2y+1}=(1−t)/(1−3t+t^2), which is the OGF of (F_{2x+1})_{x≥0}; similarly for the odd diagonal. Or proceed by induction using Pascal identities.

Uniform nonperiodicity for all N (to output.md)
Proposition. Fix N≥1 and set g(x)=a_N(xN)=f_{xN}(ζ_N). Then there exists a constant C_N∈ℚ(ζ_N) such that
  g(x)=F_{2x+1}+C_N F_{2x}  for all x≥0.
In particular, g satisfies g(x+2)=3g(x+1)−g(x) with g(0)=1, hence is unbounded and not periodic. Therefore {a_N(n)} is not periodic for any N.
Proof. Using Lemma 2 and q=ζ_N,
  f_{xN}(q)=∑_{i=0}^{xN} q^{i(i−xN)} [xN+i; 2i]_q.
Write i=yN+r with y≥0 and 0≤r≤N−1. Then q^{i(i−xN)}=ζ_N^{r^2}. Apply q–Lucas at q=ζ_N (standard result; equivalently, [am+b;cm+d]_q≡C(a,c)[b;d]_q mod Φ_N(q), hence equality at q=ζ_N):
- If r=0, then [xN+yN;2yN]_q|_{q=ζ_N}=C(x+y,2y), giving ∑_{y=0}^{x} C(x+y,2y)=F_{2x+1} by Lemma 4.
- If 0<r<N/2, then 2r< N, so the residue-small Gaussian is [r;2r]=0 and this block vanishes.
- If N/2≤r≤N−1, then the carry gives [xN+yN+r;2yN+2r]_q|_{q=ζ_N}=C(x+y,2y+1)[r;2r−N]_{ζ_N}, with y ranging 0≤y≤x−1. Summing over y yields F_{2x} by Lemma 4. The r-block contributes w_r F_{2x} with w_r:=ζ_N^{r^2}[r;2r−N]_{ζ_N}.
Collecting the r=0 and r≥N/2 blocks gives g(x)=F_{2x+1}+C_N F_{2x} where C_N=∑_{r=⌈N/2⌉}^{N−1} w_r. As F_{2x} and F_{2x+1} satisfy the same second-order recurrence, so does g, and g(0)=1. The characteristic roots (3±√5)/2 have modulus ≠1, so the only periodic solution is the zero sequence; g is nonzero, hence nonperiodic and unbounded. ∎

Example checks (consistency and sanity)
- N=2: C_2=ζ_2^{1}[1;0]_{−1}=−1, so g(x)=F_{2x+1}−F_{2x}=F_{2x−1}, matching the even-index formula in the N=2 theorem.
- N=3: C_3=ζ_3^{4}[2;1]_{ζ_3}=ζ_3(1+ζ_3)=ζ_3+ζ_3^2=−1, so g(x)=F_{2x+1}−F_{2x}. In particular, a_3(3)=2−1=1 and a_3(6)=5−3=2.
- N=4: r∈{2,3} gives w_2=1 and w_3=ζ_4^{9}[3;2]_{i}=i·(1+i−1)=−1, hence C_4=0 and g(x)=F_{2x+1}.

Specific edits to improve rigor and clarity
- Add Lemmas 1–4 (with short proofs) to proofs.md.
- Add the uniform Proposition to output.md as the main structural result; this immediately implies nonperiodicity for all N and explains the phenomenon.
- Correct all occurrences of the erroneous statement a_2(n)=F_{n+2} (e.g., in Round 1 Summary). Replace with the piecewise formulas or with the uniform subsequence formula when n is a multiple of N.
- Remove the OGF-based periodicity heuristic; it is unsupported and contradicted by the Proposition.
- Keep the varying-root discussion (q=ζ_n) separate from the fixed-root problem or omit it here.
- Replace “a_2(0)=1=F_{−1}” with a_2(0)=1 and the even-index formula for t≥1, or explicitly define backward Fibonacci if you wish to keep that identity.

Next steps (optional positive directions)
- Compute C_N explicitly for small N and record the first few values of a_N(xN)=F_{2x+1}+C_N F_{2x} to illustrate growth and nonperiodicity.
- Generalize to residues s≠0: show a_N(xN+s)=A_s F_{2x}+B_s F_{2x+1}+C_s F_{2x+2} with constants in ℚ(ζ_N), by the same residue-class decomposition; record the common recurrence g_s(x+2)=3g_s(x+1)−g_s(x).
- Explore reductions modulo primes for these recurrences (Pisano-type periodicity). This is a plausible, rigorous replacement for the original (false) periodicity claim.

Summary
- The current N=2 disproof is correct. To make the writeup rigorous and complete, add the independence-from-v lemma, the symmetric–standard conversion proof, the q=−1 specialization lemma, and the diagonal Fibonacci sums. Promote a uniform nonperiodicity proposition along n=xN to output.md, and remove unsupported OGF periodicity heuristics. Correct minor inconsistencies (a_2(n)=F_{n+2}, F_{−1}). These edits will yield a self-contained, clear refutation together with informative structural insight valid for all N.
