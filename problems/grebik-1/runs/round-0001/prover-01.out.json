This holds independently of any periodicity of T\u2032.\n- Therefore, in the statement of the problem, the mere existence of T1 with \u03a9 \u2295 T1 = X1 \u00d7 S1 forces \u03a9 to be a column, so the requested example (\u03a9 not a column) cannot exist. The extra hypotheses (periodicity, irrational \u03b1, X1 and X2 not translates) are unnecessary for this obstruction.\n\nSetup and notation\nLet \u03a9 = \u22c3_{j=1}^m {s_j} \u00d7 I_j where s_j \u2208 Z and I_j \u2282 S1 are intervals of lengths \u2113_j := |I_j| > 0. A tiling is a set T \u2282 Z \u00d7 S1 such that the translates {\u03a9 + t : t \u2208 T} form a disjoint cover (up to null sets) of Z \u00d7 S1.\n\nBasic fact about a component that fills full circles\nProposition 1 (Integer length identity at a filled column). Suppose T\u2032 \u2282 Z \u00d7 S1 satisfies \u03a9 \u2295 T\u2032 = X \u00d7 S1 for some nonempty X \u2282 Z. Then for every n \u2208 X there exist finite, nonnegative integers c_j(n) (1 \u2264 j \u2264 m) such that\n\u2211_{j=1}^m c_j(n) \u2113_j = 1.\nMoreover, for each fixed n \u2208 X, only finitely many copies of intervals are used at the fiber {n} \u00d7 S1.\nProof. Fix n \u2208 X. By hypothesis, the union of subintervals appearing in {\u03a9 + t : t \u2208 T\u2032} at the fiber {n} \u00d7 S1 is a disjoint cover (up to endpoints) of S1. Each translate \u03a9 + t contributes, at most, one interval of type j (namely I_j translated by the S1-coordinate of t) to this fiber, namely when t_Z = n \u2212 s_j. Because the cover is disjoint and measurable, only finitely many such intervals can appear (else the total measure would exceed 1). Let c_j(n) be the number of intervals of type j used at {n} \u00d7 S1. Taking measures gives \u2211_j c_j(n) \u2113_j = 1. \u220e\n\nFrom a filled column to a column tiling\nProposition 2 (Columnization). Assume there exists T\u2032 with \u03a9 \u2295 T\u2032 = X \u00d7 S1 for some nonempty X \u2282 Z. Then \u03a9 is a column.\nProof. Pick any n0 \u2208 X and take the integer vector c = (c_j) with c_j := c_j(n0) from Proposition 1, so \u2211_j c_j \u2113_j = 1 and c_j \u2208 N are finite. Because the I_j are intervals, we can place c_j translates of I_j in S1, for j = 1,\u2026,m, disjointly so that their union is all of S1 (up to endpoints). Concretely, choose pairwise disjoint subintervals J_{j,r} (1 \u2264 r \u2264 c_j) with J_{j,r} = I_j + \u03b8_{j,r} whose union is S1.\nNow set, for each u \u2208 Z,\nT^{(u)} := { (u, \u03b8_{j,r}) : 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m, 1 \u2264 r \u2264 c_j }.\nDefine T* := \u2294_{u\u2208Z} T^{(u)}. For a fixed fiber n \u2208 Z, the only u contributing at n are u \u2208 n \u2212 {s_1,\u2026,s_m}; for each such u, exactly one index j is selected (namely j with s_j = n \u2212 u), and the contributions from all u produce precisely the multiset {J_{j,r} : 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m, 1 \u2264 r \u2264 c_j}, which tiles S1 by construction. Hence \u03a9 \u2295 T* = Z \u00d7 S1 (disjointly up to null sets).\nFor each u, \u03a9 \u2295 T^{(u)} covers exactly the finite set X^{(u)} := {s_j + u : 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m} of Z-columns (each with full S1). Thus T* admits a decomposition into components indexed by u with finite X^{(u)}. Refining to an irreducible decomposition (if necessary) keeps at least one finite X-component (every refinement of a finite X^{(u)} remains a finite union of Z-columns, hence some irreducible subcomponent still has finite X). Therefore \u03a9 is a column. \u220e\n\nConsequence for the problem\nIn the problem\u2019s setting, one assumes the existence of a tiling T with an irreducible decomposition T = T1 \u2294 T2 such that \u03a9 \u2295 T1 = X1 \u00d7 S1 and \u03a9 \u2295 T2 = X2 \u00d7 S1 (disjoint, up to null sets), together with periodicity conditions for T1 and T2. Since T1 is nonempty and already fills whole circles on X1, Proposition 2 applies and implies \u03a9 is a column. Hence no \u03a9 that is not a column can satisfy the problem\u2019s hypotheses.\n\nConclusion (answer to the problem)\nNo. There is no tile \u03a9 that is not a column and admits such a tiling T with the stated two-component periodic structure. In fact, much more generally, the mere existence of any nonempty component T\u2032 with \u03a9 \u2295 T\u2032 = X \u00d7 S1 forces \u03a9 to be a column, regardless of periodicity or the relation between X1 and X2.\n\nObstacles/remarks\n- The above argument avoids any delicate use of the irrationality of \u03b1 or residue-class combinatorics modulo a; the obstruction is purely measure-combinatorial at a single filled column.\n- If desired, one can combine this with modular-combinatorial constraints (e.g. via Cauchy\u2013Davenport) to restrict possible residue patterns for S = {s_j} modulo a; but this is unnecessary for the negative answer."
