Ideas
- Key observation: If a nonempty component T′ of some tiling by Ω already fills whole S1 on a set of Z-columns X (i.e. Ω ⊕ T′ = X × S1), then Ω is automatically a column. This holds independently of any periodicity of T′.
- Therefore, in the statement of the problem, the mere existence of T1 with Ω ⊕ T1 = X1 × S1 forces Ω to be a column, so the requested example (Ω not a column) cannot exist. The extra hypotheses (periodicity, irrational α, X1 and X2 not translates) are unnecessary for this obstruction.

Setup and notation
Let Ω = ⋃_{j=1}^m {s_j} × I_j where s_j ∈ Z and I_j ⊂ S1 are intervals of lengths ℓ_j := |I_j| > 0. A tiling is a set T ⊂ Z × S1 such that the translates {Ω + t : t ∈ T} form a disjoint cover (up to null sets) of Z × S1.

Basic fact about a component that fills full circles
Proposition 1 (Integer length identity at a filled column). Suppose T′ ⊂ Z × S1 satisfies Ω ⊕ T′ = X × S1 for some nonempty X ⊂ Z. Then for every n ∈ X there exist finite, nonnegative integers c_j(n) (1 ≤ j ≤ m) such that
∑_{j=1}^m c_j(n) ℓ_j = 1.
Moreover, for each fixed n ∈ X, only finitely many copies of intervals are used at the fiber {n} × S1.
Proof. Fix n ∈ X. By hypothesis, the union of subintervals appearing in {Ω + t : t ∈ T′} at the fiber {n} × S1 is a disjoint cover (up to endpoints) of S1. Each translate Ω + t contributes, at most, one interval of type j (namely I_j translated by the S1-coordinate of t) to this fiber, namely when t_Z = n − s_j. Because the cover is disjoint and measurable, only finitely many such intervals can appear (else the total measure would exceed 1). Let c_j(n) be the number of intervals of type j used at {n} × S1. Taking measures gives ∑_j c_j(n) ℓ_j = 1. ∎

From a filled column to a column tiling
Proposition 2 (Columnization). Assume there exists T′ with Ω ⊕ T′ = X × S1 for some nonempty X ⊂ Z. Then Ω is a column.
Proof. Pick any n0 ∈ X and take the integer vector c = (c_j) with c_j := c_j(n0) from Proposition 1, so ∑_j c_j ℓ_j = 1 and c_j ∈ N are finite. Because the I_j are intervals, we can place c_j translates of I_j in S1, for j = 1,…,m, disjointly so that their union is all of S1 (up to endpoints). Concretely, choose pairwise disjoint subintervals J_{j,r} (1 ≤ r ≤ c_j) with J_{j,r} = I_j + θ_{j,r} whose union is S1.
Now set, for each u ∈ Z,
T^{(u)} := { (u, θ_{j,r}) : 1 ≤ j ≤ m, 1 ≤ r ≤ c_j }.
Define T* := ⊔_{u∈Z} T^{(u)}. For a fixed fiber n ∈ Z, the only u contributing at n are u ∈ n − {s_1,…,s_m}; for each such u, exactly one index j is selected (namely j with s_j = n − u), and the contributions from all u produce precisely the multiset {J_{j,r} : 1 ≤ j ≤ m, 1 ≤ r ≤ c_j}, which tiles S1 by construction. Hence Ω ⊕ T* = Z × S1 (disjointly up to null sets).
For each u, Ω ⊕ T^{(u)} covers exactly the finite set X^{(u)} := {s_j + u : 1 ≤ j ≤ m} of Z-columns (each with full S1). Thus T* admits a decomposition into components indexed by u with finite X^{(u)}. Refining to an irreducible decomposition (if necessary) keeps at least one finite X-component (every refinement of a finite X^{(u)} remains a finite union of Z-columns, hence some irreducible subcomponent still has finite X). Therefore Ω is a column. ∎

Consequence for the problem
In the problem’s setting, one assumes the existence of a tiling T with an irreducible decomposition T = T1 ⊔ T2 such that Ω ⊕ T1 = X1 × S1 and Ω ⊕ T2 = X2 × S1 (disjoint, up to null sets), together with periodicity conditions for T1 and T2. Since T1 is nonempty and already fills whole circles on X1, Proposition 2 applies and implies Ω is a column. Hence no Ω that is not a column can satisfy the problem’s hypotheses.

Conclusion (answer to the problem)
No. There is no tile Ω that is not a column and admits such a tiling T with the stated two-component periodic structure. In fact, much more generally, the mere existence of any nonempty component T′ with Ω ⊕ T′ = X × S1 forces Ω to be a column, regardless of periodicity or the relation between X1 and X2.

Obstacles/remarks
- The above argument avoids any delicate use of the irrationality of α or residue-class combinatorics modulo a; the obstruction is purely measure-combinatorial at a single filled column.
- If desired, one can combine this with modular-combinatorial constraints (e.g. via Cauchy–Davenport) to restrict possible residue patterns for S = {s_j} modulo a; but this is unnecessary for the negative answer.
