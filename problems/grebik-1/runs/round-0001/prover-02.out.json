The \u201cu-coordinate\u201d of T interacts with columns only through u mod d. This forces a canonical residue-class decomposition of any tiling T.\n- Show two basic facts:\n  1) In any tiling, for each u \u2208 Z there is exactly one phase \u03b8(u) with (u, \u03b8(u)) \u2208 T. Hence T is the graph of a function s: Z \u2192 S^1.\n  2) The decomposition of T by u modulo d yields an irreducible decomposition. Consequently, the number of irreducible components of any tiling equals d.\n- Therefore, an irreducible decomposition with exactly two components forces d = 2, and then the two X-sets are the two congruence classes modulo 2, i.e., translates of each other. This contradicts the requirement \u201cX1 and X2 are not translates.\u201d Thus the answer to the problem is negative, independently of the periodicity conditions.\n\nFormal lemmas\nAssume each I_j has positive length (we may discard null-length intervals since the tiling is up to null sets).\n\nLemma 1 (one point per integer fiber). Let T tile with \u03a9. Then for each u \u2208 Z there is a unique \u03b8(u) \u2208 S^1 with (u, \u03b8(u)) \u2208 T.\nProof. Fix u. Consider the column x = u + n_1. In the disjoint union \u03a9 \u2295 T = Z \u00d7 S^1, to cover x via the j = 1 stick, we must have some t \u2208 T with t^Z = u; uniqueness follows because two distinct t with the same integer coordinate u would both contribute a positive-measure subset I_1 (shifted differently) to the same column x (for j = 1), contradicting disjointness. Existence follows because otherwise the j = 1 contribution to column x is missing, contradicting coverage. Hence T = {(u, s(u)) : u \u2208 Z} for some s: Z \u2192 S^1. \u220e\n\nLemma 2 (residue-class decomposition). Let d := gcd{n_j \u2212 n_h}. For r \u2208 Z/dZ define\n- T_r := {(u, s(u)) \u2208 T : u \u2261 r (mod d)},\n- X_r := {x \u2208 Z : x \u2261 r + n_1 (mod d)}.\nThen \u03a9 \u2295 T_r = X_r \u00d7 S^1 (disjoint up to null sets), and T = \u2294_{r\u2208Z/dZ} T_r, Z = \u2294_{r\u2208Z/dZ} X_r.\nProof. If (u, s(u)) \u2208 T_r, then for any j we have u + n_j \u2261 r + n_1 (mod d), so \u03a9 + (u, s(u)) contributes only to columns in X_r. Conversely, fix x \u2208 X_r. Then for each j, the unique u = x \u2212 n_j satisfies u \u2261 r (mod d); by Lemma 1, (u, s(u)) \u2208 T_r and yields the j-th disjoint slice in column x. Summing over j gives S^1 exactly. Summing over r gives the full tiling and a disjoint partition by residues. \u220e\n\nLemma 3 (irreducibility of residue components). Each T_r is irreducible in the sense of the problem.\nProof. Suppose T_r = A \u2294 B with \u03a9 \u2295 A = Y \u00d7 S^1 and \u03a9 \u2295 B = (X_r \\ Y) \u00d7 S^1. Write u = r + kd (k \u2208 Z) and let K := {k \u2208 Z : (r + kd, s(r + kd)) \u2208 A}. Fix k \u2208 K and some j. The column x := (r + kd) + n_j lies in Y. For x to be fully covered by A, we must have for every h, the point u_h := x \u2212 n_h = r + (k + (n_j \u2212 n_h)/d) d also in A. Thus for each e in E := {(n_j \u2212 n_h)/d : 1 \u2264 h \u2264 m} we need k + e \u2208 K. Since d = gcd(n_j \u2212 n_h), the set E has gcd 1; hence the subgroup generated by E is Z, so K is either empty or all Z. Therefore A = \u2205 or B = \u2205, i.e., T_r is irreducible. \u220e\n\nConsequences\n- By Lemmas 1\u20133, any tiling has an irreducible decomposition with exactly d components T_r (one per residue class modulo d), and every irreducible component is one of these T_r. In particular, the number of irreducible components equals d.\n- If an irreducible decomposition has exactly two components, then d = 2. The corresponding bands of columns are X_0 and X_1, the two congruence classes modulo 2 shifted by n_1. Hence X_1 = X_0 + 1 (a translate). Therefore one cannot have exactly two irreducible components whose X-sets are not translates.\n\nAnswer to the problem\nNo. For any \u03a9 of the prescribed form and any tiling T, the irreducible decomposition has exactly d = gcd{n_j \u2212 n_h} components, with column-sets X_r equal to congruence classes modulo d. If there are exactly two components, then d = 2 and the two X-sets are translates of each other. Thus there is no tile \u03a9 admitting a tiling T whose irreducible decomposition has exactly two components with X_1 and X_2 not translates, regardless of the periodicities demanded for T_1 and T_2.\n\nExamples/obstacles\n- A naive attempt with m = 2 and complementary intervals fails even earlier: it forces s(u + (n_2 \u2212 n_1)) = s(u), incompatible with an irrational (a, \u03b1)-twist unless \u03b1 is rational. But the residue-class argument already rules out the requested configuration in general.\n\nNext steps\n- The above gives a structural invariant: the number of irreducible components equals gcd of the vertical offsets. It would be useful to record this as a general lemma for future rounds and to explore how periodicity constraints on T_i translate to algebraic constraints on s(u) and the function f on Z/dZ."
