Ideas
- Decompose any tiling by the arithmetic structure of the vertical coordinates n_j. Let d := gcd{n_j − n_h : 1 ≤ j,h ≤ m}. The “u-coordinate” of T interacts with columns only through u mod d. This forces a canonical residue-class decomposition of any tiling T.
- Show two basic facts:
  1) In any tiling, for each u ∈ Z there is exactly one phase θ(u) with (u, θ(u)) ∈ T. Hence T is the graph of a function s: Z → S^1.
  2) The decomposition of T by u modulo d yields an irreducible decomposition. Consequently, the number of irreducible components of any tiling equals d.
- Therefore, an irreducible decomposition with exactly two components forces d = 2, and then the two X-sets are the two congruence classes modulo 2, i.e., translates of each other. This contradicts the requirement “X1 and X2 are not translates.” Thus the answer to the problem is negative, independently of the periodicity conditions.

Formal lemmas
Assume each I_j has positive length (we may discard null-length intervals since the tiling is up to null sets).

Lemma 1 (one point per integer fiber). Let T tile with Ω. Then for each u ∈ Z there is a unique θ(u) ∈ S^1 with (u, θ(u)) ∈ T.
Proof. Fix u. Consider the column x = u + n_1. In the disjoint union Ω ⊕ T = Z × S^1, to cover x via the j = 1 stick, we must have some t ∈ T with t^Z = u; uniqueness follows because two distinct t with the same integer coordinate u would both contribute a positive-measure subset I_1 (shifted differently) to the same column x (for j = 1), contradicting disjointness. Existence follows because otherwise the j = 1 contribution to column x is missing, contradicting coverage. Hence T = {(u, s(u)) : u ∈ Z} for some s: Z → S^1. ∎

Lemma 2 (residue-class decomposition). Let d := gcd{n_j − n_h}. For r ∈ Z/dZ define
- T_r := {(u, s(u)) ∈ T : u ≡ r (mod d)},
- X_r := {x ∈ Z : x ≡ r + n_1 (mod d)}.
Then Ω ⊕ T_r = X_r × S^1 (disjoint up to null sets), and T = ⊔_{r∈Z/dZ} T_r, Z = ⊔_{r∈Z/dZ} X_r.
Proof. If (u, s(u)) ∈ T_r, then for any j we have u + n_j ≡ r + n_1 (mod d), so Ω + (u, s(u)) contributes only to columns in X_r. Conversely, fix x ∈ X_r. Then for each j, the unique u = x − n_j satisfies u ≡ r (mod d); by Lemma 1, (u, s(u)) ∈ T_r and yields the j-th disjoint slice in column x. Summing over j gives S^1 exactly. Summing over r gives the full tiling and a disjoint partition by residues. ∎

Lemma 3 (irreducibility of residue components). Each T_r is irreducible in the sense of the problem.
Proof. Suppose T_r = A ⊔ B with Ω ⊕ A = Y × S^1 and Ω ⊕ B = (X_r \ Y) × S^1. Write u = r + kd (k ∈ Z) and let K := {k ∈ Z : (r + kd, s(r + kd)) ∈ A}. Fix k ∈ K and some j. The column x := (r + kd) + n_j lies in Y. For x to be fully covered by A, we must have for every h, the point u_h := x − n_h = r + (k + (n_j − n_h)/d) d also in A. Thus for each e in E := {(n_j − n_h)/d : 1 ≤ h ≤ m} we need k + e ∈ K. Since d = gcd(n_j − n_h), the set E has gcd 1; hence the subgroup generated by E is Z, so K is either empty or all Z. Therefore A = ∅ or B = ∅, i.e., T_r is irreducible. ∎

Consequences
- By Lemmas 1–3, any tiling has an irreducible decomposition with exactly d components T_r (one per residue class modulo d), and every irreducible component is one of these T_r. In particular, the number of irreducible components equals d.
- If an irreducible decomposition has exactly two components, then d = 2. The corresponding bands of columns are X_0 and X_1, the two congruence classes modulo 2 shifted by n_1. Hence X_1 = X_0 + 1 (a translate). Therefore one cannot have exactly two irreducible components whose X-sets are not translates.

Answer to the problem
No. For any Ω of the prescribed form and any tiling T, the irreducible decomposition has exactly d = gcd{n_j − n_h} components, with column-sets X_r equal to congruence classes modulo d. If there are exactly two components, then d = 2 and the two X-sets are translates of each other. Thus there is no tile Ω admitting a tiling T whose irreducible decomposition has exactly two components with X_1 and X_2 not translates, regardless of the periodicities demanded for T_1 and T_2.

Examples/obstacles
- A naive attempt with m = 2 and complementary intervals fails even earlier: it forces s(u + (n_2 − n_1)) = s(u), incompatible with an irrational (a, α)-twist unless α is rational. But the residue-class argument already rules out the requested configuration in general.

Next steps
- The above gives a structural invariant: the number of irreducible components equals gcd of the vertical offsets. It would be useful to record this as a general lemma for future rounds and to explore how periodicity constraints on T_i translate to algebraic constraints on s(u) and the function f on Z/dZ.
