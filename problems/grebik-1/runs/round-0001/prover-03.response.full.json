These constraints are testable and can guide either construction or impossibility proofs.\\n\\nIssues, gaps, and suggested fixes\\n1) Measure and \u201cup to null sets\u201d\\n- Issue: \u201cdisjoint union up to null sets\u201d is used but the underlying \u03c3-algebra and measure are not fixed. The natural choice is product measure \u03bc = counting on Z \u00d7 Lebesgue on S1.

Pairwise disjointness a.e. on the n-th fiber implies the family of arcs {I_j + t_y : (t,j) \u2208 M(n)} is almost disjoint in S1 and contained in S1; hence the sum of their lengths is at most 1.

If \u03a9 \u2295 T_i = X_i \u00d7 S1 and Y_i := proj_Z(T_i) \u2282 Z is the set of anchor columns used by T_i, then X_i = Y_i + N := {y + n : y \u2208 Y_i, n \u2208 N}.\\nProof. If y \u2208 Y_i, then for each n \u2208 N the translate \u03a9 + (y,\u03b8) contributes to column y + n, so y + N \u2282 X_i. Conversely, if n \u2208 X_i, some (t,j) with t_x + n_j = n contributes (by Lemma A), so n \u2208 Y_i + N.\\nCorollaries:\\n- If T_i is (a,\u03b1)-periodic then Y_i is a-periodic, hence X_i = Y_i + N is a-periodic.\\n- X_1 and X_2 in the problem statement are unions of residue classes modulo a.\\n\\nLemma D (residual counting constraints for periodic tilings). Fix a \u2265 1. Suppose \u03a9 \u2295 T_i = X_i \u00d7 S1 and T_i is (a,\u03b1)-periodic. For s \u2208 Z/aZ define p^i_s := the number of anchors (per period) in residue class s, i.e., p^i_s = |{t \u2208 T_i: t_x \u2261 s (mod a)}| in one period; by local finiteness these are finite integers. Then for every residue r \u2208 Z/aZ,\\n\u03a3_{j=1}^m |I_j| \u00b7 p^i_{r - n_j} = 1 if r \u2208 X_i mod a, and 0 otherwise.\\nMoreover, for the full tiling T = T_1 \u2294 T_2, letting p_s := p^1_s + p^2_s, one has for all r,\\n\u03a3_{j=1}^m |I_j| \u00b7 p_{r - n_j} = 1.\\nProof. Fix r. In each column n \u2261 r, contributors to that column from T_i are exactly those anchors whose residues are s with s \u2261 r - n_j for some j; the count equals p^i_{r - n_j}. Lemma A gives the unit-sum in residues belonging to X_i and zero otherwise. Summing over i gives the last identity.\\n\\nConsequences and quick checks\\n- From Lemma B, in the problem any admissible partition X = X_1 \u2294 X_2 must be a partition of Z into unions of residues mod a. \u201cNot translates\u201d then forces a \u2265 3; for a = 1 the sets are trivial, for a = 2 complements are translates.\\n- Lemma C forces X_i = Y_i + N. In particular, X_i is the union of |N| consecutive shifts of Y_i in Z. For many choices of N (e.g., N having two consecutive integers), X_i cannot be just a single residue class; it must contain unions that are \u201cthick\u201d relative to Y_i. This is a strong combinatorial constraint that can be tested residue-wise.\\n- Lemma D yields a finite linear system in the unknown integers p^i_s. This is a necessary condition, independent of \u03b1. It is suitable for computer search over small a and small m, and also for hand contradictions.\\n\\nToy example illustrating obstruction\\nTake m = 2, N = {0,1}, |I_1| = |I_2| = 1/2, a = 3. Try to realize X_1 = {0 mod 3}, X_2 = {1,2 mod 3}. Lemma D for i = 1 gives for r = 1: (1/2)(p^1_1 + p^1_0) = 0 \u21d2 p^1_1 = p^1_0 = 0; for r = 2: (1/2)(p^1_2 + p^1_1) = 0 \u21d2 p^1_2 = 0; but then for r = 0 one would need (1/2)(p^1_0 + p^1_2) = 1, impossible. Thus this choice cannot occur. Similar contradictions persist for many naive choices; they already show how restrictive the residue constraints are.\\n\\nRemarks on \u201ccolumn\u201d vs. non-column\\n- If there exists an irreducible component with |X_i| < \u221e, then by Lemma C the Z-projection Y_i is finite. Conversely, finiteness of Y_i gives |X_i| \u2264 |Y_i| \u00b7 |N|. The problem\u2019s requirement \u201c\u03a9 not a column\u201d means no tiling admits such a finite Y_i component; in particular the group generated by N \u2212 N may force infinite propagation of anchors. It would help to identify a structural criterion on N guaranteeing non-columnicity (e.g., gcd of N \u2212 N = 1 is necessary but probably not sufficient: you can still have finite supports modulo constraints).\\n\\nActionable clarifications to make the work rigorous and complete\\n- State the measure-theoretic framework explicitly; assume measurability and local finiteness.\\n- Fix conventions for S1 intervals (half-open arcs), and assume all |I_i| \u2208 (0,1).\\n- Correct the typos in periodicity and in the irreducible decomposition definition; adopt the \u201cno nontrivial split\u201d quantifier.\\n- Record Lemmas A\u2013D in proofs.md. They are short and will be repeatedly used.\\n- Add the corollary that X_i and Y_i are unions of residues modulo a; note that a \u2265 3 is necessary for \u201cX_1, X_2 not translates.\u201d\\n- Introduce the residue linear system (Lemma D) as the primary necessary condition for the existence of the desired decomposition; this is immediately checkable on examples.\\n\\nNext steps (concrete, testable)\\n- Computational search: Fix a \u2265 3, small m, small N \u2282 Z with small diameters, and rational lengths |I_j|. Search for integer solutions p^1, p^2 of the Lemma D system for some partition of residues into (R_1, R_2) with R_2 not a translate of R_1. If none exist for small parameters, this suggests a general obstruction to prove.\\n- Analytic obstruction: Try to prove that if 0 and 1 both lie in N (i.e., \u03a9 covers two consecutive columns in each translate), then the residue system has no solution with X_1, X_2 not translates (using that the equations couple adjacent residues). The toy contradiction above is a hint; formalize it for general lengths.\\n- Structural: Explore whether irreducibility can be rephrased via a connectivity relation on Y_i induced by N \u2212 N. If so, show that periodic components force X_i to be unions of entire connectivity classes modulo a; this may constrain the possible partitions further.\\n- Column criterion: Identify a checkable property of N (e.g., existence of a finite Y with Y + N closed under the tiling dynamics) that characterizes \u201c\u03a9 is a column.\u201d This will help verify the \u201c\u03a9 not a column\u201d hypothesis for candidates.\\n\\nSummary of main critiques/fixes\\n- Make measure and periodicity precise; fix typos.\\n- Clarify irreducibility with \u201cno nontrivial split\u201d quantifier.\\n- Record necessary lemmas (A\u2013D). They give concrete per-column and per-residue constraints and will be the backbone of either a construction or a no-go proof.\\n- Immediate necessary consequence: X_1 and X_2 must each be unions of residue classes modulo a; thus a \u2265 3 is necessary for \u201cnot translates.\u201d\\n- The residue linear system (Lemma D) is the key test. The toy example demonstrates how fast contradictions arise, guiding further analysis or computational exploration.\"}",
