Ideas and scope
- The setup is natural (tiling the lcsc group Z × S1 by finite unions of vertical arcs), but several definitions are underspecified or ambiguous. Tightening them now will prevent hidden pitfalls in later arguments (especially because “up to null sets” and irrational periodicity interact with measurability/ergodicity).
- I list precise issues, propose fixes, and extract necessary structural constraints that any example must satisfy. These constraints are testable and can guide either construction or impossibility proofs.

Issues, gaps, and suggested fixes
1) Measure and “up to null sets”
- Issue: “disjoint union up to null sets” is used but the underlying σ-algebra and measure are not fixed. The natural choice is product measure μ = counting on Z × Lebesgue on S1. Measurability of all sets should be assumed.
- Fix: State explicitly: all sets are μ-measurable; equalities of sets are modulo μ-null sets; “disjoint union” means pairwise intersections have μ-measure 0; coverage means complement has μ-measure 0.

2) Intervals in S1
- Issue: “interval” on S1 is ambiguous (endpoints, wrap-around). Endpoints matter only on a null set, but for clarity and to avoid edge-cases at 0 ≡ 1, choose a convention.
- Fix: Define intervals to be half-open arcs [x,y) in R/Z; wrap-around [x,1) ∪ [0,y) when y < x. Assume all I_i have positive length; note that changing endpoints does not affect tilings modulo null sets.

3) Size and regularity of T
- Issue: T is an arbitrary subset of Z × S1. Without countability/local finiteness, one can encode pathology; also “disjoint union” with uncountably many positive-measure pieces is delicate.
- Fix: Require T to be countable and locally finite: for each n ∈ Z, only finitely many t ∈ T can contribute to column n (equivalently, for each d ∈ Z, the fiber T(d) := {θ: (d,θ) ∈ T} used in the tiling must be finite; this follows anyway from disjointness and positive lengths, see Lemma A below). This ensures sums of lengths per column are finite.

4) Definition of irreducible decomposition
- Issues:
  - Typo: X_i = X_i^0 ⊔ X^1_0 should be X_i = X_i^0 ⊔ X_i^1.
  - Ambiguous quantification: “if we write T_i = T_i^0 ⊔ T_i^1 and X_i = X_i^0 ⊔ X_i^1 such that … then either X_i^0 = ∅ or X_i^1 = ∅.” As stated, the condition is vacuous (choose the trivial split with one empty part). The intent is a minimality/indecomposability condition.
- Fix (precise): Call T_i irreducible if there do not exist nonempty disjoint T_i^0, T_i^1 partitioning T_i and disjoint X_i^0, X_i^1 partitioning X_i with Ω ⊕ T_i^j = X_i^j × S1 for j=0,1. Equivalently, for every such partitions realizing the covering property, one of X_i^j is empty.

5) Definition of “column”
- Issue: “Ω is a column if there is a tiling T with an irreducible component X_i finite.” This is plausible but unusual; clarify nonemptiness and that finiteness refers to cardinality.
- Fix: Specify: there exists a tiling and an irreducible component (T_i,X_i) with 0 < |X_i| < ∞. Note this implies the Z-projection of T_i is finite as well.

6) Periodicity
- Issue: Typo: “We say A ⊂ Z × S1 is (a,α)-periodic if T+(a,α)=T.” The right-hand side should read A.
- Issue: “α > 0 irrational” is ill-posed on S1; irrational means α ∈ R/Z has infinite order, i.e., α ∉ Q/Z. The sign is irrelevant on the circle.
- Fix: Define (a,α)-periodic: A + (a,α) = A with a ∈ Z\{0} and α ∈ R/Z of infinite order.

7) Allowing n_i = n_j
- Issue: This is allowed; union of several arcs at the same column is fine. Just note that the model is a finite union of fibers {n} × J_{n,k} with finitely many arcs J_{n,k} per n. No change needed, but good to say explicitly.

8) Uniqueness/meaning of the decomposition
- Observation: The intended decomposition is the partition of Z into “columns covered by the i-th sub-tiling.” This is consistent with the formal condition Ω ⊕ T_i = X_i × S1. Note it follows (see Lemma C) that X_i is determined by the Z-projection of T_i via Minkowski sum with {n_j}.

Core structural lemmas (necessary conditions)
Let Ω = ⋃_{j=1}^m {n_j} × I_j with |I_j| > 0. Let μ be counting × Lebesgue.

Lemma A (finiteness and unit-sum per column). Let Ω ⊕ T = Z × S1 be a tiling. For each n ∈ Z, define M(n) = {(t,j): t ∈ T, 1 ≤ j ≤ m, n = t_x + n_j}. Then M(n) is finite and ∑_{(t,j) ∈ M(n)} |I_j| = 1.
Proof. Pairwise disjointness a.e. on the n-th fiber implies the family of arcs {I_j + t_y : (t,j) ∈ M(n)} is almost disjoint in S1 and contained in S1; hence the sum of their lengths is at most 1. If M(n) were infinite, since min_j |I_j| > 0, the sum would diverge, contradiction. Coverage a.e. forces the sum to be exactly 1.

Lemma B (periodicity forces X_i periodic). If Ω ⊕ T_i = X_i × S1 and T_i is (a,α)-periodic, then X_i is a-periodic in Z, i.e., X_i + a = X_i. In particular, X_i is a union of residue classes modulo a.
Proof. Ω ⊕ (T_i + (a,α)) = (Ω ⊕ T_i) + (a,α) = (X_i × S1) + (a,α) = (X_i + a) × S1, but T_i + (a,α) = T_i, so Ω ⊕ T_i = (X_i + a) × S1. Therefore X_i = X_i + a.

Lemma C (covered columns are the Minkowski sum of anchor columns and N). Let N := {n_1,…,n_m}. If Ω ⊕ T_i = X_i × S1 and Y_i := proj_Z(T_i) ⊂ Z is the set of anchor columns used by T_i, then X_i = Y_i + N := {y + n : y ∈ Y_i, n ∈ N}.
Proof. If y ∈ Y_i, then for each n ∈ N the translate Ω + (y,θ) contributes to column y + n, so y + N ⊂ X_i. Conversely, if n ∈ X_i, some (t,j) with t_x + n_j = n contributes (by Lemma A), so n ∈ Y_i + N.
Corollaries:
- If T_i is (a,α)-periodic then Y_i is a-periodic, hence X_i = Y_i + N is a-periodic.
- X_1 and X_2 in the problem statement are unions of residue classes modulo a.

Lemma D (residual counting constraints for periodic tilings). Fix a ≥ 1. Suppose Ω ⊕ T_i = X_i × S1 and T_i is (a,α)-periodic. For s ∈ Z/aZ define p^i_s := the number of anchors (per period) in residue class s, i.e., p^i_s = |{t ∈ T_i: t_x ≡ s (mod a)}| in one period; by local finiteness these are finite integers. Then for every residue r ∈ Z/aZ,
Σ_{j=1}^m |I_j| · p^i_{r - n_j} = 1 if r ∈ X_i mod a, and 0 otherwise.
Moreover, for the full tiling T = T_1 ⊔ T_2, letting p_s := p^1_s + p^2_s, one has for all r,
Σ_{j=1}^m |I_j| · p_{r - n_j} = 1.
Proof. Fix r. In each column n ≡ r, contributors to that column from T_i are exactly those anchors whose residues are s with s ≡ r - n_j for some j; the count equals p^i_{r - n_j}. Lemma A gives the unit-sum in residues belonging to X_i and zero otherwise. Summing over i gives the last identity.

Consequences and quick checks
- From Lemma B, in the problem any admissible partition X = X_1 ⊔ X_2 must be a partition of Z into unions of residues mod a. “Not translates” then forces a ≥ 3; for a = 1 the sets are trivial, for a = 2 complements are translates.
- Lemma C forces X_i = Y_i + N. In particular, X_i is the union of |N| consecutive shifts of Y_i in Z. For many choices of N (e.g., N having two consecutive integers), X_i cannot be just a single residue class; it must contain unions that are “thick” relative to Y_i. This is a strong combinatorial constraint that can be tested residue-wise.
- Lemma D yields a finite linear system in the unknown integers p^i_s. This is a necessary condition, independent of α. It is suitable for computer search over small a and small m, and also for hand contradictions.

Toy example illustrating obstruction
Take m = 2, N = {0,1}, |I_1| = |I_2| = 1/2, a = 3. Try to realize X_1 = {0 mod 3}, X_2 = {1,2 mod 3}. Lemma D for i = 1 gives for r = 1: (1/2)(p^1_1 + p^1_0) = 0 ⇒ p^1_1 = p^1_0 = 0; for r = 2: (1/2)(p^1_2 + p^1_1) = 0 ⇒ p^1_2 = 0; but then for r = 0 one would need (1/2)(p^1_0 + p^1_2) = 1, impossible. Thus this choice cannot occur. Similar contradictions persist for many naive choices; they already show how restrictive the residue constraints are.

Remarks on “column” vs. non-column
- If there exists an irreducible component with |X_i| < ∞, then by Lemma C the Z-projection Y_i is finite. Conversely, finiteness of Y_i gives |X_i| ≤ |Y_i| · |N|. The problem’s requirement “Ω not a column” means no tiling admits such a finite Y_i component; in particular the group generated by N − N may force infinite propagation of anchors. It would help to identify a structural criterion on N guaranteeing non-columnicity (e.g., gcd of N − N = 1 is necessary but probably not sufficient: you can still have finite supports modulo constraints).

Actionable clarifications to make the work rigorous and complete
- State the measure-theoretic framework explicitly; assume measurability and local finiteness.
- Fix conventions for S1 intervals (half-open arcs), and assume all |I_i| ∈ (0,1).
- Correct the typos in periodicity and in the irreducible decomposition definition; adopt the “no nontrivial split” quantifier.
- Record Lemmas A–D in proofs.md. They are short and will be repeatedly used.
- Add the corollary that X_i and Y_i are unions of residues modulo a; note that a ≥ 3 is necessary for “X_1, X_2 not translates.”
- Introduce the residue linear system (Lemma D) as the primary necessary condition for the existence of the desired decomposition; this is immediately checkable on examples.

Next steps (concrete, testable)
- Computational search: Fix a ≥ 3, small m, small N ⊂ Z with small diameters, and rational lengths |I_j|. Search for integer solutions p^1, p^2 of the Lemma D system for some partition of residues into (R_1, R_2) with R_2 not a translate of R_1. If none exist for small parameters, this suggests a general obstruction to prove.
- Analytic obstruction: Try to prove that if 0 and 1 both lie in N (i.e., Ω covers two consecutive columns in each translate), then the residue system has no solution with X_1, X_2 not translates (using that the equations couple adjacent residues). The toy contradiction above is a hint; formalize it for general lengths.
- Structural: Explore whether irreducibility can be rephrased via a connectivity relation on Y_i induced by N − N. If so, show that periodic components force X_i to be unions of entire connectivity classes modulo a; this may constrain the possible partitions further.
- Column criterion: Identify a checkable property of N (e.g., existence of a finite Y with Y + N closed under the tiling dynamics) that characterizes “Ω is a column.” This will help verify the “Ω not a column” hypothesis for candidates.

Summary of main critiques/fixes
- Make measure and periodicity precise; fix typos.
- Clarify irreducibility with “no nontrivial split” quantifier.
- Record necessary lemmas (A–D). They give concrete per-column and per-residue constraints and will be the backbone of either a construction or a no-go proof.
- Immediate necessary consequence: X_1 and X_2 must each be unions of residue classes modulo a; thus a ≥ 3 is necessary for “not translates.”
- The residue linear system (Lemma D) is the key test. The toy example demonstrates how fast contradictions arise, guiding further analysis or computational exploration.
