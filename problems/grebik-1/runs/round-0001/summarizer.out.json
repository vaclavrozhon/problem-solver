  "summary_md": "We formalized measure/periodicity conventions and proved structural lemmas for \u03a9 = \u22c3_{j=1}^m {n_j}\u00d7I_j. Main facts: per-column finiteness (each column sees finitely many intervals whose lengths sum to 1); canonical residue-class decomposition by d := gcd{n_j\u2212n_h} giving T = \u2294_{r\u2208Z/dZ} T_r and \u03a9\u2295T_r = X_r\u00d7S^1; every irreducible component is contained in a single residue class, so any irreducible decomposition has at least d components. Hence a two-component irreducible decomposition with X_1,X_2 not translates forces d=1 (and one also needs a\u22653). For an (a,\u03b1)-periodic component T_i we get X_i a-periodic, X_i = Y_i+N (Y_i = proj_Z(T_i)), and the finite per-residue linear constraints \u03a3_j \u2113_j p^i_{r\u2212n_j} = 1_{r\u2208X_i} (r mod a). Thus the existence question reduces to solving this finite integer linear system for d=1,a\u22653 and then realizing compatible S^1-phases or proving a global obstruction (e.g. Fourier).
