We are in the setup $\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{S}^1$ (where we view $\mathbb{S}^1=\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$), and we consider subset $\Omega\subseteq \mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{S}^1$ of the form
$$\Omega=\bigcup_{i=1}^m \{n_i\}\times I_i,$$
where $m\in \mathbb{N}$, $n_i\in \mathbb{Z}$ and $I_i\subseteq \mathbb{S}^1$ is an interval for every $1\le i\le m$.
Note that we allow have $n_i=n_j$ for $i\not= j$.

We say that $\Omega$ is a tile if there is $T\subseteq \mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{S}^1$ such that
$$\Omega\oplus T=\bigsqcup_{t\in T} (\Omega+t)=\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{S}^1,$$
where the disjoin union is understand up to null sets.
In that case, we also say that $T$ is a tiling of $\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{S}^1$ by $\Omega$.

Let $T$ be a tiling.
An \emph{irreducible decomposition of $T$} is $T=\bigsqcup_{i\in I} T_i$ and $\mathbb{Z}=\bigsqcup_{i\in I} X_i$ such that
\begin{itemize}
    \item $T_i\not=\emptyset$ for every $i\in I$,
    \item $\Omega\oplus T_i=X_i\times \mathbb{S}^1$,
    \item if we write $T_i=T^0_i\sqcup T^1_i$ and $X_i=X_i^0\sqcup X^1_0$ such that $\Omega\oplus T^j_i=X^j_i\times\mathbb{S}^1$ for $j\in \{0,1\}$, then either $X^0_i=\emptyset$ or  $X^1_i=\emptyset$.
\end{itemize}

We say that a tile $\Omega$ is a \emph{column} if there is a tiling $T$ that has an irreducible decomposition $\{T_i\}_{i\in I}$ and $\{X_i\}_{i\in I}$ such that  $|X_i|<\infty$ for some $i\in I$.

We say that a set $A\subseteq \mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{S}^1$ is \emph{$(a,\alpha)$-periodic} if $T+(a,\alpha)=T$.


\begin{problem}
    Is there a tile $\Omega$ that is not a column and that admits a tiling $T$ such that the irreducible decomposition of $T$ has the form $T=T_1\sqcup T_2$ and $X=X_1\sqcup X_2$ such that
    \begin{itemize}
        \item there are $a\in \mathbb{Z}\setminus \{0\}$, $\alpha>0$ irrational such that $T_1$ is $(a,0)$-periodic and $T_2$ is $(a,\alpha)$-periodic,
        \item $X_1$ and $X_2$ are not translates of each other.
    \end{itemize}
\end{problem}

Clarifications and structural progress
- Measure: We work with counting measure on Z and Lebesgue measure on S^1; all sets are measurable; equalities/disjointness are up to null sets.
- Intervals: Use half-open arcs on S^1; endpoints are negligible.
- Periodicity: A ⊂ Z × S^1 is (a,α)-periodic if A + (a,α) = A with a ∈ Z\{0}, α ∈ R/Z of infinite order for ‘irrational’.
- Irreducible component: T_i is irreducible if it cannot be split into nontrivial disjoint subfamilies that themselves tile disjoint subsets of columns.

Per-column finiteness
For any tiling Ω ⊕ T = Z × S^1 and any column n, only finitely many pieces appear and the sum of their lengths is 1.

Residue-class (mod d) decomposition
Let d := gcd{n_j − n_h}. For r ∈ Z/dZ define T_r := {t ∈ T : t_Z ≡ r (mod d)} and X_r := {x ∈ Z : x ≡ r + n_1 (mod d)}. Then Ω ⊕ T_r = X_r × S^1, and T = ⊔_{r} T_r, Z = ⊔_{r} X_r.

Consequences
- Every irreducible component lives inside a single residue class modulo d; thus any irreducible decomposition has at least d components.
- Therefore an irreducible decomposition with exactly two components forces d ≤ 2. If d = 2, the two X-sets are the two residue classes modulo 2 (translates), so to have X_1, X_2 not translates one must have d = 1 and a ≥ 3.

Periodic components
If T_i is (a,α)-periodic, then X_i is a-periodic (union of residue classes mod a). Moreover, with N = {n_j}, if Y_i := proj_Z(T_i), then X_i = Y_i + N.

Residue linear system (per-period counts)
Fix a and set ℓ_j = |I_j|. For (a,α)-periodic T_i, let p^i_s be the number of anchors with integer coordinate s in a chosen complete residue set mod a (local finiteness ⇒ p^i_s < ∞). Then for each residue r ∈ Z/aZ:
Σ_j ℓ_j · p^i_{r − n_j} = 1 if r ∈ X_i (mod a), and 0 otherwise.

Implications for the main problem
- Necessary: d = 1 and a ≥ 3.
- Unknown: Existence for d = 1 under the given periodicities. We must either produce a construction (solving the linear system and realizing phases) or prove a global obstruction (e.g., Fourier analysis on Z/aZ combined with irreducibility).

Planned next steps
1) Prove formally that any irreducible component is contained in a single residue class modulo d (recorded in proofs). 2) Focus on d = 1, a ≥ 3; choose small m, small N with gcd 1, and attempt to solve the per-residue linear system for integer solutions with X_1, X_2 a-partition but not translates. 3) If solutions exist, construct phases consistent with (a,0) and (a,α) periodicities; otherwise develop a Fourier-based obstruction to rule them out.

# Main Results




=== Verifier Summary ===

We corrected foundational points and established a robust structural framework. Key result: any tiling admits a canonical decomposition by residue classes modulo d = gcd{n_j − n_h}; thus every irreducible component lies inside a single residue class, yielding at least d components. Hence a tiling with exactly two irreducible components and with X_1, X_2 not translates forces d = 1 (a ≥ 3 also necessary). We recorded precise measure/periodicity conventions and necessary lemmas: per-column finiteness, residue-class decomposition, periodicity ⇒ a-periodic X_i, Minkowski relation X_i = Y_i + N, and per-residue linear constraints for periodic components. Prover 1’s “columnization” is invalid; Prover 2’s uniqueness lemma is false, but his residue insight is salvaged and made rigorous. Next: concentrate on d = 1, a ≥ 3, solve the finite linear system (Lemma D) for integer counts p^1, p^2 and either produce a construction or a global obstruction (e.g., via Fourier analysis on Z/aZ).

# Rigorous Proofs



Structural lemmas for tilings by vertical intervals

Setup. Let Ω = ⋃_{j=1}^m {n_j} × I_j ⊂ Z × S^1, where I_j ⊂ S^1 are half-open arcs of positive length ℓ_j := |I_j| and n_j ∈ Z. A (measurable) tiling is a set T ⊂ Z × S^1 such that the translates {Ω + t : t ∈ T} form a pairwise disjoint cover of Z × S^1 up to null sets (counting × Lebesgue measure).

Lemma 1 (Local finiteness and unit-sum per column). For any tiling Ω ⊕ T = Z × S^1 and any n ∈ Z, the family of arcs appearing on the fiber {n} × S^1 is finite and the sum of their lengths is 1.
Proof. Each contributing arc on {n} × S^1 has positive length and the family is almost-disjoint; hence only finitely many can fit. Coverage up to null sets implies the length-sum equals 1.

Let d := gcd{n_j − n_1 : 1 ≤ j ≤ m} (equivalently gcd of all pairwise differences).

Proposition 2 (Residue-class decomposition). For r ∈ Z/dZ set T_r := {t ∈ T : t_Z ≡ r (mod d)} and X_r := {x ∈ Z : x ≡ r + n_1 (mod d)}. Then for every r,
Ω ⊕ T_r = X_r × S^1 (disjointly, up to null sets),
and T = ⊔_{r∈Z/dZ} T_r, Z = ⊔_{r∈Z/dZ} X_r.
Proof. If t = (u,θ) ∈ T_r, then every arc from Ω + t lies in columns u + n_j, all congruent to r + n_1 mod d, so Ω ⊕ T_r ⊆ X_r × S^1. Conversely, fix x ∈ X_r; any arc covering {x} × S^1 must come from some t with u + n_j = x, hence u ≡ x − n_j ≡ r (mod d). Thus only points of T_r contribute at column x. Since Ω ⊕ T covers {x} × S^1, Ω ⊕ T_r covers {x} × S^1. Disjointness of different r is clear.

Corollary 3 (Irreducible components are residue-pure; lower bound). Let T = ⊔_{i∈I} T_i be an irreducible decomposition with Ω ⊕ T_i = X_i × S^1. Then for each i, T_i ⊂ T_r for some r, and X_i ⊂ X_r. Consequently, any irreducible decomposition has at least d components. In particular, if an irreducible decomposition has exactly two components, then d ≤ 2; if d = 2, the two X-sets are the two residue classes modulo 2 (translates of each other).
Proof. Suppose T_i contains points of two distinct residue classes r ≠ r′. Then writing A := T_i ∩ T_r and B := T_i ∩ T_{r′}, we have Ω ⊕ A = (X_i ∩ X_r) × S^1 and Ω ⊕ B = (X_i ∩ X_{r′}) × S^1, a nontrivial decomposition of T_i, contradicting irreducibility. Hence T_i ⊂ T_r for some r. Since the X_r’s partition Z, at least one irreducible component is needed per residue class, giving the lower bound. For d = 2, the two residue classes are translates, so any two-component irreducible decomposition must coincide with these classes.

Lemma 4 (Periodicity ⇒ periodic columns). If Ω ⊕ T_i = X_i × S^1 and T_i is (a,α)-periodic, then X_i + a = X_i (i.e., X_i is a-periodic).
Proof. Ω ⊕ (T_i + (a,α)) = (Ω ⊕ T_i) + (a,α) = (X_i + a) × S^1. Since T_i + (a,α) = T_i, the claim follows.

Lemma 5 (Minkowski relation for a component). Let N := {n_1,…,n_m}. If Ω ⊕ T_i = X_i × S^1 and Y_i := proj_Z(T_i), then X_i = Y_i + N := {y + n : y ∈ Y_i, n ∈ N}.
Proof. If y ∈ Y_i, then (Ω + (y,θ)) contributes exactly to y + N, hence y + N ⊂ X_i. Conversely, if x ∈ X_i, at least one arc appears at x; any such arc is I_j shifted by some θ coming from a point t = (y,θ) with y + n_j = x, so x ∈ Y_i + N.

Lemma 6 (Per-residue linear constraints for periodic components). Fix a ≥ 1 and suppose Ω ⊕ T_i = X_i × S^1 with T_i (a,α)-periodic. For s ∈ Z/aZ let p^i_s be the number of anchors in T_i with integer coordinate congruent to s inside a fixed complete residue set modulo a (local finiteness ensures p^i_s < ∞). Then, for every r ∈ Z/aZ,
Σ_{j=1}^m ℓ_j · p^i_{r − n_j} = 1 if r ∈ X_i (mod a), and 0 otherwise.
Moreover, for the full tiling T = ⊔_i T_i, one has for all r,
Σ_{j=1}^m ℓ_j · p_{r − n_j} = 1, where p_s := Σ_i p^i_s.
Proof. In residue class r, contributors from T_i to a column come precisely from anchors with residues s ≡ r − n_j. The number of such anchors per period is p^i_{r − n_j}. Lemma 1 yields the unit sum on r ∈ X_i and zero otherwise. Summing over i gives the last identity.

Remarks. From Lemma 4, in the main problem any admissible partition X = X_1 ⊔ X_2 must split Z into a-periodic subsets; combined with Corollary 3, the case of exactly two irreducible components with X_1, X_2 not translates forces d = 1 and a ≥ 3.
