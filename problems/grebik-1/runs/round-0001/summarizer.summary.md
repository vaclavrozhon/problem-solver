We formalized measure/periodicity conventions and proved structural lemmas for Ω = ⋃_{j=1}^m {n_j}×I_j. Main facts: per-column finiteness (each column sees finitely many intervals whose lengths sum to 1); canonical residue-class decomposition by d := gcd{n_j−n_h} giving T = ⊔_{r∈Z/dZ} T_r and Ω⊕T_r = X_r×S^1; every irreducible component is contained in a single residue class, so any irreducible decomposition has at least d components. Hence a two-component irreducible decomposition with X_1,X_2 not translates forces d=1 (and one also needs a≥3). For an (a,α)-periodic component T_i we get X_i a-periodic, X_i = Y_i+N (Y_i = proj_Z(T_i)), and the finite per-residue linear constraints Σ_j ℓ_j p^i_{r−n_j} = 1_{r∈X_i} (r mod a). Thus the existence question reduces to solving this finite integer linear system for d=1,a≥3 and then realizing compatible S^1-phases or proving a global obstruction (e.g. Fourier).
