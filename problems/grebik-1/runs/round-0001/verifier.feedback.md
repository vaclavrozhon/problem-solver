Overall: No complete resolution yet. Prover 1’s main obstruction is incorrect; Prover 2’s “one anchor per integer” lemma is false, so his conclusion does not follow; Prover 3 provides the most reliable structural framework (measure, periodicity, residue constraints), which we should adopt. We can, however, extract a rigorous structural decomposition by residue classes modulo d := gcd{n_j − n_h}, and deduce necessary consequences for the two-component scenario.

Critique and corrections
- Prover 1: Proposition 1 (per-column finiteness and unit-length identity) is fine. Proposition 2 (“columnization”) is flawed: the constructed subfamilies T^{(u)} do not tile full circles on their columns; at a given column, contributions from many different u’s are needed. Hence the inference “existence of T′ with Ω ⊕ T′ = X × S^1 forces Ω to be a column” is invalid. Consequently, the claimed general impossibility is unsupported.
- Prover 2: Lemma 1 (uniqueness of a point (u, θ) in T for each u) is false: multiple anchors at the same integer coordinate are possible as long as their contributions to each affected column remain disjoint. However, the residue-class idea is salvageable: for d = gcd{n_j − n_1}, the sets T_r := {t: t_Z ≡ r (mod d)} and X_r := {x: x ≡ r + n_1 (mod d)} satisfy Ω ⊕ T_r = X_r × S^1. This yields a canonical decomposition that any irreducible decomposition must refine. From this one gets: every irreducible component is contained in a single residue class mod d, so any irreducible decomposition has at least d components. In particular, if there are exactly two irreducible components, then d ≤ 2; if d = 2, those two X-sets are necessarily the two residue classes modulo 2, hence translates. This fixes Prover 2’s conclusion pathway without the false Lemma 1.
- Prover 3: Solid. The measure-theoretic clarifications and Lemmas A–D are correct and useful. Minor tweaks: in Lemma D, define the per-period counts precisely by restricting integer coordinates to a fixed complete residue set modulo a; local finiteness ensures these cardinalities are finite.

Consequences for the main problem
- Two irreducible components with X_1, X_2 not translates forces d = 1 (since d = 2 would make the two X-sets translates). Also, a ≥ 3 (since for a = 2 complements are translates).
- Periodic components imply X_i are unions of residues mod a, and X_i = Y_i + N (Minkowski). This yields concrete per-residue linear constraints (Lemma D) on the anchor counts p^i_s.

Next steps
1) Record and use the canonical residue decomposition and its corollaries (≥ d components; d = 2 ⇒ translates). 2) Focus on d = 1, a ≥ 3. Set up the finite linear system of Lemma D and search for integer solutions p^1, p^2 with X_1, X_2 a-partition and not translates; start with small m, small a (≥ 3), small N with gcd 1. 3) If solutions appear, attempt to realize phases respecting (a,0) and (a,α) periodicities; otherwise, develop a Fourier/residue obstruction for d = 1 ruling out non-translate two-component tilings. 4) Formalize irreducibility refinement: show rigorously that each irreducible component lives inside one residue class modulo d.
