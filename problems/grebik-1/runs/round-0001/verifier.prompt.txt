=== SYSTEM ===
You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md, proofs.md, and output.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers
- notes.md (informal progress & exploratory work so far)
- proofs.md (rigorous proofs & detailed mathematics so far)
- output.md (main results found so far)

**Three-tier file system guidelines**:
- **notes.md**: Readable, log of exploratory work, intuitions, failed attempts, ideas. Prefer appending. Replace only if old notes are clearly misleading. It should be self-contained: In particular, reading it should make sense without knowing the output of provers in past rounds. 

- **proofs.md**: Complete rigorous mathematical proofs with full details. Think twice before adding anything. Contains proven lemmas, theorems, and detailed derivations. Only add mathematically verified content here.
- **output.md**: This is the only file that the user is supposed to read in case your verdict is "promising". It has to be self-contained. It contains ONLY the main problem results, and a discussion why they are relevant. It is extremely selective. Think twice before promoting proofs from proofs.md to output.md. Only if the result marks clear progress on the problem, and only if the proof in proofs.md has been thoroughly vetted by provers and you, it can join output.md. Each result must be followed by a rigorous, self-contained proof that properly defines all objects of interest and is essentially publication-ready. 

Tasks:
1) Audit rigor: identify unjustified steps, false statements, missing lemmas; produce minimal counterexamples.
2) Triage value: separate genuine progress from noise.
3) Guide next steps: propose what provers should try next.

We are in the setup $\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{S}^1$ (where we view $\mathbb{S}^1=\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$), and we consider subset $\Omega\subseteq \mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{S}^1$ of the form
$$\Omega=\bigcup_{i=1}^m \{n_i\}\times I_i,$$
where $m\in \mathbb{N}$, $n_i\in \mathbb{Z}$ and $I_i\subseteq \mathbb{S}^1$ is an interval for every $1\le i\le m$.
Note that we allow have $n_i=n_j$ for $i\not= j$.

We say that $\Omega$ is a tile if there is $T\subseteq \mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{S}^1$ such that
$$\Omega\oplus T=\bigsqcup_{t\in T} (\Omega+t)=\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{S}^1,$$
where the disjoin union is understand up to null sets.
In that case, we also say that $T$ is a tiling of $\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{S}^1$ by $\Omega$.

Let $T$ be a tiling.
An \emph{irreducible decomposition of $T$} is $T=\bigsqcup_{i\in I} T_i$ and $\mathbb{Z}=\bigsqcup_{i\in I} X_i$ such that
\begin{itemize}
    \item $T_i\not=\emptyset$ for every $i\in I$,
    \item $\Omega\oplus T_i=X_i\times \mathbb{S}^1$,
    \item if we write $T_i=T^0_i\sqcup T^1_i$ and $X_i=X_i^0\sqcup X^1_0$ such that $\Omega\oplus T^j_i=X^j_i\times\mathbb{S}^1$ for $j\in \{0,1\}$, then either $X^0_i=\emptyset$ or  $X^1_i=\emptyset$.
\end{itemize}

We say that a tile $\Omega$ is a \emph{column} if there is a tiling $T$ that has an irreducible decomposition $\{T_i\}_{i\in I}$ and $\{X_i\}_{i\in I}$ such that  $|X_i|<\infty$ for some $i\in I$.

We say that a set $A\subseteq \mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{S}^1$ is \emph{$(a,\alpha)$-periodic} if $T+(a,\alpha)=T$.


\begin{problem}
    Is there a tile $\Omega$ that is not a column and that admits a tiling $T$ such that the irreducible decomposition of $T$ has the form $T=T_1\sqcup T_2$ and $X=X_1\sqcup X_2$ such that
    \begin{itemize}
        \item there are $a\in \mathbb{Z}\setminus \{0\}$, $\alpha>0$ irrational such that $T_1$ is $(a,0)$-periodic and $T_2$ is $(a,\alpha)$-periodic,
        \item $X_1$ and $X_2$ are not translates of each other.
    \end{itemize}
\end{problem}

Ideas
- Key observation: If a nonempty component T′ of some tiling by Ω already fills whole S1 on a set of Z-columns X (i.e. Ω ⊕ T′ = X × S1), then Ω is automatically a column. This holds independently of any periodicity of T′.
- Therefore, in the statement of the problem, the mere existence of T1 with Ω ⊕ T1 = X1 × S1 forces Ω to be a column, so the requested example (Ω not a column) cannot exist. The extra hypotheses (periodicity, irrational α, X1 and X2 not translates) are unnecessary for this obstruction.

Setup and notation
Let Ω = ⋃_{j=1}^m {s_j} × I_j where s_j ∈ Z and I_j ⊂ S1 are intervals of lengths ℓ_j := |I_j| > 0. A tiling is a set T ⊂ Z × S1 such that the translates {Ω + t : t ∈ T} form a disjoint cover (up to null sets) of Z × S1.

Basic fact about a component that fills full circles
Proposition 1 (Integer length identity at a filled column). Suppose T′ ⊂ Z × S1 satisfies Ω ⊕ T′ = X × S1 for some nonempty X ⊂ Z. Then for every n ∈ X there exist finite, nonnegative integers c_j(n) (1 ≤ j ≤ m) such that
∑_{j=1}^m c_j(n) ℓ_j = 1.
Moreover, for each fixed n ∈ X, only finitely many copies of intervals are used at the fiber {n} × S1.
Proof. Fix n ∈ X. By hypothesis, the union of subintervals appearing in {Ω + t : t ∈ T′} at the fiber {n} × S1 is a disjoint cover (up to endpoints) of S1. Each translate Ω + t contributes, at most, one interval of type j (namely I_j translated by the S1-coordinate of t) to this fiber, namely when t_Z = n − s_j. Because the cover is disjoint and measurable, only finitely many such intervals can appear (else the total measure would exceed 1). Let c_j(n) be the number of intervals of type j used at {n} × S1. Taking measures gives ∑_j c_j(n) ℓ_j = 1. ∎

From a filled column to a column tiling
Proposition 2 (Columnization). Assume there exists T′ with Ω ⊕ T′ = X × S1 for some nonempty X ⊂ Z. Then Ω is a column.
Proof. Pick any n0 ∈ X and take the integer vector c = (c_j) with c_j := c_j(n0) from Proposition 1, so ∑_j c_j ℓ_j = 1 and c_j ∈ N are finite. Because the I_j are intervals, we can place c_j translates of I_j in S1, for j = 1,…,m, disjointly so that their union is all of S1 (up to endpoints). Concretely, choose pairwise disjoint subintervals J_{j,r} (1 ≤ r ≤ c_j) with J_{j,r} = I_j + θ_{j,r} whose union is S1.
Now set, for each u ∈ Z,
T^{(u)} := { (u, θ_{j,r}) : 1 ≤ j ≤ m, 1 ≤ r ≤ c_j }.
Define T* := ⊔_{u∈Z} T^{(u)}. For a fixed fiber n ∈ Z, the only u contributing at n are u ∈ n − {s_1,…,s_m}; for each such u, exactly one index j is selected (namely j with s_j = n − u), and the contributions from all u produce precisely the multiset {J_{j,r} : 1 ≤ j ≤ m, 1 ≤ r ≤ c_j}, which tiles S1 by construction. Hence Ω ⊕ T* = Z × S1 (disjointly up to null sets).
For each u, Ω ⊕ T^{(u)} covers exactly the finite set X^{(u)} := {s_j + u : 1 ≤ j ≤ m} of Z-columns (each with full S1). Thus T* admits a decomposition into components indexed by u with finite X^{(u)}. Refining to an irreducible decomposition (if necessary) keeps at least one finite X-component (every refinement of a finite X^{(u)} remains a finite union of Z-columns, hence some irreducible subcomponent still has finite X). Therefore Ω is a column. ∎

Consequence for the problem
In the problem’s setting, one assumes the existence of a tiling T with an irreducible decomposition T = T1 ⊔ T2 such that Ω ⊕ T1 = X1 × S1 and Ω ⊕ T2 = X2 × S1 (disjoint, up to null sets), together with periodicity conditions for T1 and T2. Since T1 is nonempty and already fills whole circles on X1, Proposition 2 applies and implies Ω is a column. Hence no Ω that is not a column can satisfy the problem’s hypotheses.

Conclusion (answer to the problem)
No. There is no tile Ω that is not a column and admits such a tiling T with the stated two-component periodic structure. In fact, much more generally, the mere existence of any nonempty component T′ with Ω ⊕ T′ = X × S1 forces Ω to be a column, regardless of periodicity or the relation between X1 and X2.

Obstacles/remarks
- The above argument avoids any delicate use of the irrationality of α or residue-class combinatorics modulo a; the obstruction is purely measure-combinatorial at a single filled column.
- If desired, one can combine this with modular-combinatorial constraints (e.g. via Cauchy–Davenport) to restrict possible residue patterns for S = {s_j} modulo a; but this is unnecessary for the negative answer.

Ideas
- Decompose any tiling by the arithmetic structure of the vertical coordinates n_j. Let d := gcd{n_j − n_h : 1 ≤ j,h ≤ m}. The “u-coordinate” of T interacts with columns only through u mod d. This forces a canonical residue-class decomposition of any tiling T.
- Show two basic facts:
  1) In any tiling, for each u ∈ Z there is exactly one phase θ(u) with (u, θ(u)) ∈ T. Hence T is the graph of a function s: Z → S^1.
  2) The decomposition of T by u modulo d yields an irreducible decomposition. Consequently, the number of irreducible components of any tiling equals d.
- Therefore, an irreducible decomposition with exactly two components forces d = 2, and then the two X-sets are the two congruence classes modulo 2, i.e., translates of each other. This contradicts the requirement “X1 and X2 are not translates.” Thus the answer to the problem is negative, independently of the periodicity conditions.

Formal lemmas
Assume each I_j has positive length (we may discard null-length intervals since the tiling is up to null sets).

Lemma 1 (one point per integer fiber). Let T tile with Ω. Then for each u ∈ Z there is a unique θ(u) ∈ S^1 with (u, θ(u)) ∈ T.
Proof. Fix u. Consider the column x = u + n_1. In the disjoint union Ω ⊕ T = Z × S^1, to cover x via the j = 1 stick, we must have some t ∈ T with t^Z = u; uniqueness follows because two distinct t with the same integer coordinate u would both contribute a positive-measure subset I_1 (shifted differently) to the same column x (for j = 1), contradicting disjointness. Existence follows because otherwise the j = 1 contribution to column x is missing, contradicting coverage. Hence T = {(u, s(u)) : u ∈ Z} for some s: Z → S^1. ∎

Lemma 2 (residue-class decomposition). Let d := gcd{n_j − n_h}. For r ∈ Z/dZ define
- T_r := {(u, s(u)) ∈ T : u ≡ r (mod d)},
- X_r := {x ∈ Z : x ≡ r + n_1 (mod d)}.
Then Ω ⊕ T_r = X_r × S^1 (disjoint up to null sets), and T = ⊔_{r∈Z/dZ} T_r, Z = ⊔_{r∈Z/dZ} X_r.
Proof. If (u, s(u)) ∈ T_r, then for any j we have u + n_j ≡ r + n_1 (mod d), so Ω + (u, s(u)) contributes only to columns in X_r. Conversely, fix x ∈ X_r. Then for each j, the unique u = x − n_j satisfies u ≡ r (mod d); by Lemma 1, (u, s(u)) ∈ T_r and yields the j-th disjoint slice in column x. Summing over j gives S^1 exactly. Summing over r gives the full tiling and a disjoint partition by residues. ∎

Lemma 3 (irreducibility of residue components). Each T_r is irreducible in the sense of the problem.
Proof. Suppose T_r = A ⊔ B with Ω ⊕ A = Y × S^1 and Ω ⊕ B = (X_r \ Y) × S^1. Write u = r + kd (k ∈ Z) and let K := {k ∈ Z : (r + kd, s(r + kd)) ∈ A}. Fix k ∈ K and some j. The column x := (r + kd) + n_j lies in Y. For x to be fully covered by A, we must have for every h, the point u_h := x − n_h = r + (k + (n_j − n_h)/d) d also in A. Thus for each e in E := {(n_j − n_h)/d : 1 ≤ h ≤ m} we need k + e ∈ K. Since d = gcd(n_j − n_h), the set E has gcd 1; hence the subgroup generated by E is Z, so K is either empty or all Z. Therefore A = ∅ or B = ∅, i.e., T_r is irreducible. ∎

Consequences
- By Lemmas 1–3, any tiling has an irreducible decomposition with exactly d components T_r (one per residue class modulo d), and every irreducible component is one of these T_r. In particular, the number of irreducible components equals d.
- If an irreducible decomposition has exactly two components, then d = 2. The corresponding bands of columns are X_0 and X_1, the two congruence classes modulo 2 shifted by n_1. Hence X_1 = X_0 + 1 (a translate). Therefore one cannot have exactly two irreducible components whose X-sets are not translates.

Answer to the problem
No. For any Ω of the prescribed form and any tiling T, the irreducible decomposition has exactly d = gcd{n_j − n_h} components, with column-sets X_r equal to congruence classes modulo d. If there are exactly two components, then d = 2 and the two X-sets are translates of each other. Thus there is no tile Ω admitting a tiling T whose irreducible decomposition has exactly two components with X_1 and X_2 not translates, regardless of the periodicities demanded for T_1 and T_2.

Examples/obstacles
- A naive attempt with m = 2 and complementary intervals fails even earlier: it forces s(u + (n_2 − n_1)) = s(u), incompatible with an irrational (a, α)-twist unless α is rational. But the residue-class argument already rules out the requested configuration in general.

Next steps
- The above gives a structural invariant: the number of irreducible components equals gcd of the vertical offsets. It would be useful to record this as a general lemma for future rounds and to explore how periodicity constraints on T_i translate to algebraic constraints on s(u) and the function f on Z/dZ.

Ideas and scope
- The setup is natural (tiling the lcsc group Z × S1 by finite unions of vertical arcs), but several definitions are underspecified or ambiguous. Tightening them now will prevent hidden pitfalls in later arguments (especially because “up to null sets” and irrational periodicity interact with measurability/ergodicity).
- I list precise issues, propose fixes, and extract necessary structural constraints that any example must satisfy. These constraints are testable and can guide either construction or impossibility proofs.

Issues, gaps, and suggested fixes
1) Measure and “up to null sets”
- Issue: “disjoint union up to null sets” is used but the underlying σ-algebra and measure are not fixed. The natural choice is product measure μ = counting on Z × Lebesgue on S1. Measurability of all sets should be assumed.
- Fix: State explicitly: all sets are μ-measurable; equalities of sets are modulo μ-null sets; “disjoint union” means pairwise intersections have μ-measure 0; coverage means complement has μ-measure 0.

2) Intervals in S1
- Issue: “interval” on S1 is ambiguous (endpoints, wrap-around). Endpoints matter only on a null set, but for clarity and to avoid edge-cases at 0 ≡ 1, choose a convention.
- Fix: Define intervals to be half-open arcs [x,y) in R/Z; wrap-around [x,1) ∪ [0,y) when y < x. Assume all I_i have positive length; note that changing endpoints does not affect tilings modulo null sets.

3) Size and regularity of T
- Issue: T is an arbitrary subset of Z × S1. Without countability/local finiteness, one can encode pathology; also “disjoint union” with uncountably many positive-measure pieces is delicate.
- Fix: Require T to be countable and locally finite: for each n ∈ Z, only finitely many t ∈ T can contribute to column n (equivalently, for each d ∈ Z, the fiber T(d) := {θ: (d,θ) ∈ T} used in the tiling must be finite; this follows anyway from disjointness and positive lengths, see Lemma A below). This ensures sums of lengths per column are finite.

4) Definition of irreducible decomposition
- Issues:
  - Typo: X_i = X_i^0 ⊔ X^1_0 should be X_i = X_i^0 ⊔ X_i^1.
  - Ambiguous quantification: “if we write T_i = T_i^0 ⊔ T_i^1 and X_i = X_i^0 ⊔ X_i^1 such that … then either X_i^0 = ∅ or X_i^1 = ∅.” As stated, the condition is vacuous (choose the trivial split with one empty part). The intent is a minimality/indecomposability condition.
- Fix (precise): Call T_i irreducible if there do not exist nonempty disjoint T_i^0, T_i^1 partitioning T_i and disjoint X_i^0, X_i^1 partitioning X_i with Ω ⊕ T_i^j = X_i^j × S1 for j=0,1. Equivalently, for every such partitions realizing the covering property, one of X_i^j is empty.

5) Definition of “column”
- Issue: “Ω is a column if there is a tiling T with an irreducible component X_i finite.” This is plausible but unusual; clarify nonemptiness and that finiteness refers to cardinality.
- Fix: Specify: there exists a tiling and an irreducible component (T_i,X_i) with 0 < |X_i| < ∞. Note this implies the Z-projection of T_i is finite as well.

6) Periodicity
- Issue: Typo: “We say A ⊂ Z × S1 is (a,α)-periodic if T+(a,α)=T.” The right-hand side should read A.
- Issue: “α > 0 irrational” is ill-posed on S1; irrational means α ∈ R/Z has infinite order, i.e., α ∉ Q/Z. The sign is irrelevant on the circle.
- Fix: Define (a,α)-periodic: A + (a,α) = A with a ∈ Z\{0} and α ∈ R/Z of infinite order.

7) Allowing n_i = n_j
- Issue: This is allowed; union of several arcs at the same column is fine. Just note that the model is a finite union of fibers {n} × J_{n,k} with finitely many arcs J_{n,k} per n. No change needed, but good to say explicitly.

8) Uniqueness/meaning of the decomposition
- Observation: The intended decomposition is the partition of Z into “columns covered by the i-th sub-tiling.” This is consistent with the formal condition Ω ⊕ T_i = X_i × S1. Note it follows (see Lemma C) that X_i is determined by the Z-projection of T_i via Minkowski sum with {n_j}.

Core structural lemmas (necessary conditions)
Let Ω = ⋃_{j=1}^m {n_j} × I_j with |I_j| > 0. Let μ be counting × Lebesgue.

Lemma A (finiteness and unit-sum per column). Let Ω ⊕ T = Z × S1 be a tiling. For each n ∈ Z, define M(n) = {(t,j): t ∈ T, 1 ≤ j ≤ m, n = t_x + n_j}. Then M(n) is finite and ∑_{(t,j) ∈ M(n)} |I_j| = 1.
Proof. Pairwise disjointness a.e. on the n-th fiber implies the family of arcs {I_j + t_y : (t,j) ∈ M(n)} is almost disjoint in S1 and contained in S1; hence the sum of their lengths is at most 1. If M(n) were infinite, since min_j |I_j| > 0, the sum would diverge, contradiction. Coverage a.e. forces the sum to be exactly 1.

Lemma B (periodicity forces X_i periodic). If Ω ⊕ T_i = X_i × S1 and T_i is (a,α)-periodic, then X_i is a-periodic in Z, i.e., X_i + a = X_i. In particular, X_i is a union of residue classes modulo a.
Proof. Ω ⊕ (T_i + (a,α)) = (Ω ⊕ T_i) + (a,α) = (X_i × S1) + (a,α) = (X_i + a) × S1, but T_i + (a,α) = T_i, so Ω ⊕ T_i = (X_i + a) × S1. Therefore X_i = X_i + a.

Lemma C (covered columns are the Minkowski sum of anchor columns and N). Let N := {n_1,…,n_m}. If Ω ⊕ T_i = X_i × S1 and Y_i := proj_Z(T_i) ⊂ Z is the set of anchor columns used by T_i, then X_i = Y_i + N := {y + n : y ∈ Y_i, n ∈ N}.
Proof. If y ∈ Y_i, then for each n ∈ N the translate Ω + (y,θ) contributes to column y + n, so y + N ⊂ X_i. Conversely, if n ∈ X_i, some (t,j) with t_x + n_j = n contributes (by Lemma A), so n ∈ Y_i + N.
Corollaries:
- If T_i is (a,α)-periodic then Y_i is a-periodic, hence X_i = Y_i + N is a-periodic.
- X_1 and X_2 in the problem statement are unions of residue classes modulo a.

Lemma D (residual counting constraints for periodic tilings). Fix a ≥ 1. Suppose Ω ⊕ T_i = X_i × S1 and T_i is (a,α)-periodic. For s ∈ Z/aZ define p^i_s := the number of anchors (per period) in residue class s, i.e., p^i_s = |{t ∈ T_i: t_x ≡ s (mod a)}| in one period; by local finiteness these are finite integers. Then for every residue r ∈ Z/aZ,
Σ_{j=1}^m |I_j| · p^i_{r - n_j} = 1 if r ∈ X_i mod a, and 0 otherwise.
Moreover, for the full tiling T = T_1 ⊔ T_2, letting p_s := p^1_s + p^2_s, one has for all r,
Σ_{j=1}^m |I_j| · p_{r - n_j} = 1.
Proof. Fix r. In each column n ≡ r, contributors to that column from T_i are exactly those anchors whose residues are s with s ≡ r - n_j for some j; the count equals p^i_{r - n_j}. Lemma A gives the unit-sum in residues belonging to X_i and zero otherwise. Summing over i gives the last identity.

Consequences and quick checks
- From Lemma B, in the problem any admissible partition X = X_1 ⊔ X_2 must be a partition of Z into unions of residues mod a. “Not translates” then forces a ≥ 3; for a = 1 the sets are trivial, for a = 2 complements are translates.
- Lemma C forces X_i = Y_i + N. In particular, X_i is the union of |N| consecutive shifts of Y_i in Z. For many choices of N (e.g., N having two consecutive integers), X_i cannot be just a single residue class; it must contain unions that are “thick” relative to Y_i. This is a strong combinatorial constraint that can be tested residue-wise.
- Lemma D yields a finite linear system in the unknown integers p^i_s. This is a necessary condition, independent of α. It is suitable for computer search over small a and small m, and also for hand contradictions.

Toy example illustrating obstruction
Take m = 2, N = {0,1}, |I_1| = |I_2| = 1/2, a = 3. Try to realize X_1 = {0 mod 3}, X_2 = {1,2 mod 3}. Lemma D for i = 1 gives for r = 1: (1/2)(p^1_1 + p^1_0) = 0 ⇒ p^1_1 = p^1_0 = 0; for r = 2: (1/2)(p^1_2 + p^1_1) = 0 ⇒ p^1_2 = 0; but then for r = 0 one would need (1/2)(p^1_0 + p^1_2) = 1, impossible. Thus this choice cannot occur. Similar contradictions persist for many naive choices; they already show how restrictive the residue constraints are.

Remarks on “column” vs. non-column
- If there exists an irreducible component with |X_i| < ∞, then by Lemma C the Z-projection Y_i is finite. Conversely, finiteness of Y_i gives |X_i| ≤ |Y_i| · |N|. The problem’s requirement “Ω not a column” means no tiling admits such a finite Y_i component; in particular the group generated by N − N may force infinite propagation of anchors. It would help to identify a structural criterion on N guaranteeing non-columnicity (e.g., gcd of N − N = 1 is necessary but probably not sufficient: you can still have finite supports modulo constraints).

Actionable clarifications to make the work rigorous and complete
- State the measure-theoretic framework explicitly; assume measurability and local finiteness.
- Fix conventions for S1 intervals (half-open arcs), and assume all |I_i| ∈ (0,1).
- Correct the typos in periodicity and in the irreducible decomposition definition; adopt the “no nontrivial split” quantifier.
- Record Lemmas A–D in proofs.md. They are short and will be repeatedly used.
- Add the corollary that X_i and Y_i are unions of residues modulo a; note that a ≥ 3 is necessary for “X_1, X_2 not translates.”
- Introduce the residue linear system (Lemma D) as the primary necessary condition for the existence of the desired decomposition; this is immediately checkable on examples.

Next steps (concrete, testable)
- Computational search: Fix a ≥ 3, small m, small N ⊂ Z with small diameters, and rational lengths |I_j|. Search for integer solutions p^1, p^2 of the Lemma D system for some partition of residues into (R_1, R_2) with R_2 not a translate of R_1. If none exist for small parameters, this suggests a general obstruction to prove.
- Analytic obstruction: Try to prove that if 0 and 1 both lie in N (i.e., Ω covers two consecutive columns in each translate), then the residue system has no solution with X_1, X_2 not translates (using that the equations couple adjacent residues). The toy contradiction above is a hint; formalize it for general lengths.
- Structural: Explore whether irreducibility can be rephrased via a connectivity relation on Y_i induced by N − N. If so, show that periodic components force X_i to be unions of entire connectivity classes modulo a; this may constrain the possible partitions further.
- Column criterion: Identify a checkable property of N (e.g., existence of a finite Y with Y + N closed under the tiling dynamics) that characterizes “Ω is a column.” This will help verify the “Ω not a column” hypothesis for candidates.

Summary of main critiques/fixes
- Make measure and periodicity precise; fix typos.
- Clarify irreducibility with “no nontrivial split” quantifier.
- Record necessary lemmas (A–D). They give concrete per-column and per-residue constraints and will be the backbone of either a construction or a no-go proof.
- Immediate necessary consequence: X_1 and X_2 must each be unions of residue classes modulo a; thus a ≥ 3 is necessary for “not translates.”
- The residue linear system (Lemma D) is the key test. The toy example demonstrates how fast contradictions arise, guiding further analysis or computational exploration.
