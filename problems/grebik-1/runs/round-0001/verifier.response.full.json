Prover 1\u2019s main obstruction is incorrect; Prover 2\u2019s \u201cone anchor per integer\u201d lemma is false, so his conclusion does not follow; Prover 3 provides the most reliable structural framework (measure, periodicity, residue constraints), which we should adopt. We can, however, extract a rigorous structural decomposition by residue classes modulo d := gcd{n_j \u2212 n_h}, and deduce necessary consequences for the two-component scenario.\\n\\nCritique and corrections\\n- Prover 1: Proposition 1 (per-column finiteness and unit-length identity) is fine. Proposition 2 (\u201ccolumnization\u201d) is flawed: the constructed subfamilies T^{(u)} do not tile full circles on their columns; at a given column, contributions from many different u\u2019s are needed. Hence the inference \u201cexistence of T\u2032 with \u03a9 \u2295 T\u2032 = X \u00d7 S^1 forces \u03a9 to be a column\u201d is invalid. Consequently, the claimed general impossibility is unsupported.\\n- Prover 2: Lemma 1 (uniqueness of a point (u, \u03b8) in T for each u) is false: multiple anchors at the same integer coordinate are possible as long as their contributions to each affected column remain disjoint. However, the residue-class idea is salvageable: for d = gcd{n_j \u2212 n_1}, the sets T_r := {t: t_Z \u2261 r (mod d)} and X_r := {x: x \u2261 r + n_1 (mod d)} satisfy \u03a9 \u2295 T_r = X_r \u00d7 S^1. This yields a canonical decomposition that any irreducible decomposition must refine. From this one gets: every irreducible component is contained in a single residue class mod d, so any irreducible decomposition has at least d components. In particular, if there are exactly two irreducible components, then d \u2264 2; if d = 2, those two X-sets are necessarily the two residue classes modulo 2, hence translates. This fixes Prover 2\u2019s conclusion pathway without the false Lemma 1.\\n- Prover 3: Solid. The measure-theoretic clarifications and Lemmas A\u2013D are correct and useful. Minor tweaks: in Lemma D, define the per-period counts precisely by restricting integer coordinates to a fixed complete residue set modulo a; local finiteness ensures these cardinalities are finite.\\n\\nConsequences for the main problem\\n- Two irreducible components with X_1, X_2 not translates forces d = 1 (since d = 2 would make the two X-sets translates).

Let \u03a9 = \u22c3_{j=1}^m {n_j} \u00d7 I_j \u2282 Z \u00d7 S^1, where I_j \u2282 S^1 are half-open arcs of positive length \u2113_j := |I_j| and n_j \u2208 Z. A (measurable) tiling is a set T \u2282 Z \u00d7 S^1 such that the translates {\u03a9 + t : t \u2208 T} form a pairwise disjoint cover of Z \u00d7 S^1 up to null sets (counting \u00d7 Lebesgue measure).\\n\\nLemma 1 (Local finiteness and unit-sum per column). For any tiling \u03a9 \u2295 T = Z \u00d7 S^1 and any n \u2208 Z, the family of arcs appearing on the fiber {n} \u00d7 S^1 is finite and the sum of their lengths is 1.\\nProof. Each contributing arc on {n} \u00d7 S^1 has positive length and the family is almost-disjoint; hence only finitely many can fit. Coverage up to null sets implies the length-sum equals 1.\\n\\nLet d := gcd{n_j \u2212 n_1 : 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m} (equivalently gcd of all pairwise differences).\\n\\nProposition 2 (Residue-class decomposition). For r \u2208 Z/dZ set T_r := {t \u2208 T : t_Z \u2261 r (mod d)} and X_r := {x \u2208 Z : x \u2261 r + n_1 (mod d)}.

If t = (u,\u03b8) \u2208 T_r, then every arc from \u03a9 + t lies in columns u + n_j, all congruent to r + n_1 mod d, so \u03a9 \u2295 T_r \u2286 X_r \u00d7 S^1. Conversely, fix x \u2208 X_r; any arc covering {x} \u00d7 S^1 must come from some t with u + n_j = x, hence u \u2261 x \u2212 n_j \u2261 r (mod d). Thus only points of T_r contribute at column x. Since \u03a9 \u2295 T covers {x} \u00d7 S^1, \u03a9 \u2295 T_r covers {x} \u00d7 S^1. Disjointness of different r is clear.\\n\\nCorollary 3 (Irreducible components are residue-pure; lower bound). Let T = \u2294_{i\u2208I} T_i be an irreducible decomposition with \u03a9 \u2295 T_i = X_i \u00d7 S^1. Then for each i, T_i \u2282 T_r for some r, and X_i \u2282 X_r. Consequently, any irreducible decomposition has at least d components. In particular, if an irreducible decomposition has exactly two components, then d \u2264 2; if d = 2, the two X-sets are the two residue classes modulo 2 (translates of each other).\\nProof. Suppose T_i contains points of two distinct residue classes r \u2260 r\u2032. Then writing A := T_i \u2229 T_r and B := T_i \u2229 T_{r\u2032}, we have \u03a9 \u2295 A = (X_i \u2229 X_r) \u00d7 S^1 and \u03a9 \u2295 B = (X_i \u2229 X_{r\u2032}) \u00d7 S^1, a nontrivial decomposition of T_i, contradicting irreducibility. Hence T_i \u2282 T_r for some r. Since the X_r\u2019s partition Z, at least one irreducible component is needed per residue class, giving the lower bound. For d = 2, the two residue classes are translates, so any two-component irreducible decomposition must coincide with these classes.\\n\\nLemma 4 (Periodicity \u21d2 periodic columns). If \u03a9 \u2295 T_i = X_i \u00d7 S^1 and T_i is (a,\u03b1)-periodic, then X_i + a = X_i (i.e., X_i is a-periodic).\\nProof. \u03a9 \u2295 (T_i + (a,\u03b1)) = (\u03a9 \u2295 T_i) + (a,\u03b1) = (X_i + a) \u00d7 S^1. Since T_i + (a,\u03b1) = T_i, the claim follows.\\n\\nLemma 5 (Minkowski relation for a component). Let N := {n_1,\u2026,n_m}. If \u03a9 \u2295 T_i = X_i \u00d7 S^1 and Y_i := proj_Z(T_i), then X_i = Y_i + N := {y + n : y \u2208 Y_i, n \u2208 N}.\\nProof. If y \u2208 Y_i, then (\u03a9 + (y,\u03b8)) contributes exactly to y + N, hence y + N \u2282 X_i. Conversely, if x \u2208 X_i, at least one arc appears at x; any such arc is I_j shifted by some \u03b8 coming from a point t = (y,\u03b8) with y + n_j = x, so x \u2208 Y_i + N.\\n\\nLemma 6 (Per-residue linear constraints for periodic components). Fix a \u2265 1 and suppose \u03a9 \u2295 T_i = X_i \u00d7 S^1 with T_i (a,\u03b1)-periodic. For s \u2208 Z/aZ let p^i_s be the number of anchors in T_i with integer coordinate congruent to s inside a fixed complete residue set modulo a (local finiteness ensures p^i_s < \u221e). Then, for every r \u2208 Z/aZ,\\n\u03a3_{j=1}^m \u2113_j \u00b7 p^i_{r \u2212 n_j} = 1 if r \u2208 X_i (mod a), and 0 otherwise.\\nMoreover, for the full tiling T = \u2294_i T_i, one has for all r,\\n\u03a3_{j=1}^m \u2113_j \u00b7 p_{r \u2212 n_j} = 1, where p_s := \u03a3_i p^i_s.\\nProof. In residue class r, contributors from T_i to a column come precisely from anchors with residues s \u2261 r \u2212 n_j. The number of such anchors per period is p^i_{r \u2212 n_j}. Lemma 1 yields the unit sum on r \u2208 X_i and zero otherwise. Summing over i gives the last identity.\\n\\nRemarks. From Lemma 4, in the main problem any admissible partition X = X_1 \u2294 X_2 must split Z into a-periodic subsets; combined with Corollary 3, the case of exactly two irreducible components with X_1, X_2 not translates forces d = 1 and a \u2265 3.\\n\"},\"output_update\":null}",
