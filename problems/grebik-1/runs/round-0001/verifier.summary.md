We corrected foundational points and established a robust structural framework. Key result: any tiling admits a canonical decomposition by residue classes modulo d = gcd{n_j − n_h}; thus every irreducible component lies inside a single residue class, yielding at least d components. Hence a tiling with exactly two irreducible components and with X_1, X_2 not translates forces d = 1 (a ≥ 3 also necessary). We recorded precise measure/periodicity conventions and necessary lemmas: per-column finiteness, residue-class decomposition, periodicity ⇒ a-periodic X_i, Minkowski relation X_i = Y_i + N, and per-residue linear constraints for periodic components. Prover 1’s “columnization” is invalid; Prover 2’s uniqueness lemma is false, but his residue insight is salvaged and made rigorous. Next: concentrate on d = 1, a ≥ 3, solve the finite linear system (Lemma D) for integer counts p^1, p^2 and either produce a construction or a global obstruction (e.g., via Fourier analysis on Z/aZ).
