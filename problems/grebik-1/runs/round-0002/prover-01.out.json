  "content": "Ideas\n- We pursue a residue-class obstruction that rules out the desired two-component periodic decomposition when gcd(n_i \u2212 n_j) = 1. The key is the identity X_i = Y_i + N for each component (Minkowski sum of integer coordinates of anchors with the Z-support of \u03a9) and the fact that (a,\u00b7)-periodicity makes X_i, Y_i unions of residue classes mod a. In the cyclic group G = Z/aZ we then must partition G into two disjoint sets of the special form Y + S and (G\\Y) + S, where S = N mod a. When the subgroup generated by S \u2212 S equals all of G (which holds if gcd(n_i \u2212 n_j) = 1), such a disjoint partition is impossible.\n\nRigorous lemmas\nLemma 1 (Minkowski support for a component). Let \u03a9 = \u22c3_{j=1}^m {n_j} \u00d7 I_j and T_i \u2282 Z \u00d7 S^1 with \u03a9 \u2295 T_i = X_i \u00d7 S^1. Write Y_i := proj_Z(T_i). Then X_i = Y_i + N, where N := {n_1,\u2026,n_m} \u2282 Z and + is Minkowski sum in Z.\nProof. If n \u2208 X_i, then the fiber {n}\u00d7S^1 is fully covered by \u03a9 \u2295 T_i, so there is at least one anchor t \u2208 T_i and some j with n = t_Z + n_j; hence n \u2208 Y_i + N. Conversely, if n \u2208 Y_i + N, there exists t \u2208 T_i and j with n = t_Z + n_j, so \u03a9 + t contributes a subinterval of positive measure to the fiber {n}\u00d7S^1. Since \u03a9 \u2295 T_i equals either the full circle or the empty set on that fiber, it must be the full circle, hence n \u2208 X_i. \u220e\n\nLemma 2 (Residue-level identity under periodicity). If T_i is (a,\u03b2_i)-periodic, then Y_i and X_i are a-periodic subsets of Z. Let G := Z/aZ and S := N mod a. Denoting reductions mod a by bars, one has X\u0304_i = \u0232_i + S (sum in G).\nProof. (a,\u03b2_i)-periodicity implies T_i + (a,\u03b2_i) = T_i, hence proj_Z(T_i) is a-periodic; then by Lemma 1 so is X_i. Reducing Lemma 1 mod a yields X\u0304_i = \u0232_i + S. \u220e\n\nLemma 3 (Overlap in cyclic groups). Let G be a finite cyclic group, S \u2282 G, and D := S \u2212 S. If \u27e8D\u27e9 = G, then for any nontrivial Y \u2282 G, (Y + S) \u2229 ((G \\ Y) + S) \u2260 \u2205.\nProof. Pick y \u2208 Y and y\u2032 \u2208 G \\ Y. Since \u27e8D\u27e9 = G, there exist s,s\u2032 \u2208 S with s \u2212 s\u2032 = y\u2032 \u2212 y. Then y + s = y\u2032 + s\u2032 lies in both Y + S and (G \\ Y) + S. \u220e\n\nProposition (No two periodic components when gcd(n_i \u2212 n_j) = 1). Let d := gcd{n_i \u2212 n_j}. Suppose d = 1. There is no tiling \u03a9 \u2295 T = Z \u00d7 S^1 that admits an irreducible decomposition T = T_1 \u2294 T_2 with both T_1 and T_2 (a,\u00b7)-periodic (e.g., (a,0) and (a,\u03b1) with \u03b1 irrational), and \u03a9 \u2295 T_i = X_i \u00d7 S^1, with X_1, X_2 disjoint and X_1 \u2294 X_2 = Z.\nProof. By Lemma 2, X\u0304_i = \u0232_i + S in G = Z/aZ, with S = N mod a. Since d = 1, the subgroup of Z generated by {n_i \u2212 n_j} is all of Z; reducing modulo a gives \u27e8S \u2212 S\u27e9 = G. Apply Lemma 3 with Y = \u0232_1 to obtain (\u0232_1 + S) \u2229 ((G \\ \u0232_1) + S) \u2260 \u2205, i.e., X\u0304_1 \u2229 X\u0304_2 \u2260 \u2205. Hence X_1 and X_2 overlap on Z (periodically), contradicting disjointness. \u220e\n\nConsequences for the problem\n- The requested configuration (two components with T_1 (a,0)-periodic, T_2 (a,\u03b1)-periodic, \u03b1 irrational, and X_1, X_2 not translates) cannot occur for any \u03a9 with gcd(n_i \u2212 n_j) = 1. This is stronger than \u201cnot a column\u201d: it rules out any such two-component periodic decomposition.\n- Combined with the canonical d-decomposition (Notes), a two-component irreducible decomposition forces d \u2264 2. If d = 2, the two X-sets are the two residue classes modulo 2 (translates). Thus the problem\u2019s hypotheses (two components, not translates) force d = 1, which our proposition rules out. Hence answer: No.\n\nExamples\n- Take N = {0,1}. For any a, S \u2212 S = {\u22121,0,1} generates G, so the obstruction applies: no two periodic components exist. A naive attempt with a = 3 and choosing X_1 one residue class fails exactly because X\u0304_1 = \u0232_1 + {0,1} cannot be disjoint from X\u0304_2.\n\nObstacles/checks\n- The crucial identity X_i = Y_i + N uses that \u03a9 \u2295 T_i equals X_i \u00d7 S^1 fiberwise (not merely \u201csubset\u201d); this is guaranteed by the definition of irreducible decomposition.\n- The argument is independent of interval lengths and of \u03b1; irrationality plays no role.\n\nNext steps\n- Formalize the canonical d-decomposition and note that with d = 2 the only two-component option yields translates. Conclude a succinct no-go theorem for the problem.\n- Explore relaxations: allow one component nonperiodic, or allow three or more periodic components; the residue obstruction becomes a packing/covering problem Y_1 + S, \u2026, Y_k + S partition G. Characterize S for which such partitions exist (tilings of groups by translates)."
