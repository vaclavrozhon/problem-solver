=== SYSTEM ===
You are a research mathematician. 

You are being run in a loop with a verifier that checks rigor. Your goal is to make **incremental, auditable progress**. You are not expected to solve the problem at once, but to generate new, testable ideas.

Inputs: 
- task statement 
- notes.md (informal progress & exploratory work; optional) 
- proofs.md (rigorously proven results & detailed proofs; optional) 
- output.md (main results, rigorously presented; optional) 
- summary of past rounds (optional) 
- possibly some reference papers.

What counts as progress:
- Extract lemmas/heuristics from literature. Generalize them for current task, or explain why they could be helpful. 
- Explore small examples & try to break your own claims with toy counterexamples.
- Prove special cases or nontrivial bounds.
- If an approach fails, explain crisply why.
- Point out flaws in notes.md, proofs.md, or output.md (you are not rewriting these files yourself, that's verifier's job).

**Discipline.** 
- Read notes, outputs, summaries carefully before proposing new work. 
- Reference papers if relevant, but focus on *incremental, checkable steps*. 
- Do not output Markdown code fences, only raw JSON. 
- Length: at least ~200 words. 
- Organize your reasoning with short headings (Ideas, Examples, Obstacles, Next steps), make clear what your claims are and how they are supported. 

**Output**: Write your analysis as Markdown that includes both informal reasoning and any rigorous proofs. The verifier will decide what goes into notes.md, proofs.md, and output.md.

**Return strictly JSON**:

We are in the setup $\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{S}^1$ (where we view $\mathbb{S}^1=\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$), and we consider subset $\Omega\subseteq \mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{S}^1$ of the form
$$\Omega=\bigcup_{i=1}^m \{n_i\}\times I_i,$$
where $m\in \mathbb{N}$, $n_i\in \mathbb{Z}$ and $I_i\subseteq \mathbb{S}^1$ is an interval for every $1\le i\le m$.
Note that we allow have $n_i=n_j$ for $i\not= j$.

We say that $\Omega$ is a tile if there is $T\subseteq \mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{S}^1$ such that
$$\Omega\oplus T=\bigsqcup_{t\in T} (\Omega+t)=\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{S}^1,$$
where the disjoin union is understand up to null sets.
In that case, we also say that $T$ is a tiling of $\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{S}^1$ by $\Omega$.

Let $T$ be a tiling.
An \emph{irreducible decomposition of $T$} is $T=\bigsqcup_{i\in I} T_i$ and $\mathbb{Z}=\bigsqcup_{i\in I} X_i$ such that
\begin{itemize}
    \item $T_i\not=\emptyset$ for every $i\in I$,
    \item $\Omega\oplus T_i=X_i\times \mathbb{S}^1$,
    \item if we write $T_i=T^0_i\sqcup T^1_i$ and $X_i=X_i^0\sqcup X^1_0$ such that $\Omega\oplus T^j_i=X^j_i\times\mathbb{S}^1$ for $j\in \{0,1\}$, then either $X^0_i=\emptyset$ or  $X^1_i=\emptyset$.
\end{itemize}

We say that a tile $\Omega$ is a \emph{column} if there is a tiling $T$ that has an irreducible decomposition $\{T_i\}_{i\in I}$ and $\{X_i\}_{i\in I}$ such that  $|X_i|<\infty$ for some $i\in I$.

We say that a set $A\subseteq \mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{S}^1$ is \emph{$(a,\alpha)$-periodic} if $T+(a,\alpha)=T$.


\begin{problem}
    Is there a tile $\Omega$ that is not a column and that admits a tiling $T$ such that the irreducible decomposition of $T$ has the form $T=T_1\sqcup T_2$ and $X=X_1\sqcup X_2$ such that
    \begin{itemize}
        \item there are $a\in \mathbb{Z}\setminus \{0\}$, $\alpha>0$ irrational such that $T_1$ is $(a,0)$-periodic and $T_2$ is $(a,\alpha)$-periodic,
        \item $X_1$ and $X_2$ are not translates of each other.
    \end{itemize}
\end{problem}

Clarifications and structural progress
- Measure: We work with counting measure on Z and Lebesgue measure on S^1; all sets are measurable; equalities/disjointness are up to null sets.
- Intervals: Use half-open arcs on S^1; endpoints are negligible.
- Periodicity: A ⊂ Z × S^1 is (a,α)-periodic if A + (a,α) = A with a ∈ Z\{0}, α ∈ R/Z of infinite order for ‘irrational’.
- Irreducible component: T_i is irreducible if it cannot be split into nontrivial disjoint subfamilies that themselves tile disjoint subsets of columns.

Per-column finiteness
For any tiling Ω ⊕ T = Z × S^1 and any column n, only finitely many pieces appear and the sum of their lengths is 1.

Residue-class (mod d) decomposition
Let d := gcd{n_j − n_h}. For r ∈ Z/dZ define T_r := {t ∈ T : t_Z ≡ r (mod d)} and X_r := {x ∈ Z : x ≡ r + n_1 (mod d)}. Then Ω ⊕ T_r = X_r × S^1, and T = ⊔_{r} T_r, Z = ⊔_{r} X_r.

Consequences
- Every irreducible component lives inside a single residue class modulo d; thus any irreducible decomposition has at least d components.
- Therefore an irreducible decomposition with exactly two components forces d ≤ 2. If d = 2, the two X-sets are the two residue classes modulo 2 (translates), so to have X_1, X_2 not translates one must have d = 1 and a ≥ 3.

Periodic components
If T_i is (a,α)-periodic, then X_i is a-periodic (union of residue classes mod a). Moreover, with N = {n_j}, if Y_i := proj_Z(T_i), then X_i = Y_i + N.

Residue linear system (per-period counts)
Fix a and set ℓ_j = |I_j|. For (a,α)-periodic T_i, let p^i_s be the number of anchors with integer coordinate s in a chosen complete residue set mod a (local finiteness ⇒ p^i_s < ∞). Then for each residue r ∈ Z/aZ:
Σ_j ℓ_j · p^i_{r − n_j} = 1 if r ∈ X_i (mod a), and 0 otherwise.

Implications for the main problem
- Necessary: d = 1 and a ≥ 3.
- Unknown: Existence for d = 1 under the given periodicities. We must either produce a construction (solving the linear system and realizing phases) or prove a global obstruction (e.g., Fourier analysis on Z/aZ combined with irreducibility).

Planned next steps
1) Prove formally that any irreducible component is contained in a single residue class modulo d (recorded in proofs). 2) Focus on d = 1, a ≥ 3; choose small m, small N with gcd 1, and attempt to solve the per-residue linear system for integer solutions with X_1, X_2 a-partition but not translates. 3) If solutions exist, construct phases consistent with (a,0) and (a,α) periodicities; otherwise develop a Fourier-based obstruction to rule them out.

# Main Results




=== Round 1 Summary ===

We formalized measure/periodicity conventions and proved structural lemmas for Ω = ⋃_{j=1}^m {n_j}×I_j. Main facts: per-column finiteness (each column sees finitely many intervals whose lengths sum to 1); canonical residue-class decomposition by d := gcd{n_j−n_h} giving T = ⊔_{r∈Z/dZ} T_r and Ω⊕T_r = X_r×S^1; every irreducible component is contained in a single residue class, so any irreducible decomposition has at least d components. Hence a two-component irreducible decomposition with X_1,X_2 not translates forces d=1 (and one also needs a≥3). For an (a,α)-periodic component T_i we get X_i a-periodic, X_i = Y_i+N (Y_i = proj_Z(T_i)), and the finite per-residue linear constraints Σ_j ℓ_j p^i_{r−n_j} = 1_{r∈X_i} (r mod a). Thus the existence question reduces to solving this finite integer linear system for d=1,a≥3 and then realizing compatible S^1-phases or proving a global obstruction (e.g. Fourier).

=== Previous Round Feedback ===

Overall: No complete resolution yet. Prover 1’s main obstruction is incorrect; Prover 2’s “one anchor per integer” lemma is false, so his conclusion does not follow; Prover 3 provides the most reliable structural framework (measure, periodicity, residue constraints), which we should adopt. We can, however, extract a rigorous structural decomposition by residue classes modulo d := gcd{n_j − n_h}, and deduce necessary consequences for the two-component scenario.

Critique and corrections
- Prover 1: Proposition 1 (per-column finiteness and unit-length identity) is fine. Proposition 2 (“columnization”) is flawed: the constructed subfamilies T^{(u)} do not tile full circles on their columns; at a given column, contributions from many different u’s are needed. Hence the inference “existence of T′ with Ω ⊕ T′ = X × S^1 forces Ω to be a column” is invalid. Consequently, the claimed general impossibility is unsupported.
- Prover 2: Lemma 1 (uniqueness of a point (u, θ) in T for each u) is false: multiple anchors at the same integer coordinate are possible as long as their contributions to each affected column remain disjoint. However, the residue-class idea is salvageable: for d = gcd{n_j − n_1}, the sets T_r := {t: t_Z ≡ r (mod d)} and X_r := {x: x ≡ r + n_1 (mod d)} satisfy Ω ⊕ T_r = X_r × S^1. This yields a canonical decomposition that any irreducible decomposition must refine. From this one gets: every irreducible component is contained in a single residue class mod d, so any irreducible decomposition has at least d components. In particular, if there are exactly two irreducible components, then d ≤ 2; if d = 2, those two X-sets are necessarily the two residue classes modulo 2, hence translates. This fixes Prover 2’s conclusion pathway without the false Lemma 1.
- Prover 3: Solid. The measure-theoretic clarifications and Lemmas A–D are correct and useful. Minor tweaks: in Lemma D, define the per-period counts precisely by restricting integer coordinates to a fixed complete residue set modulo a; local finiteness ensures these cardinalities are finite.

Consequences for the main problem
- Two irreducible components with X_1, X_2 not translates forces d = 1 (since d = 2 would make the two X-sets translates). Also, a ≥ 3 (since for a = 2 complements are translates).
- Periodic components imply X_i are unions of residues mod a, and X_i = Y_i + N (Minkowski). This yields concrete per-residue linear constraints (Lemma D) on the anchor counts p^i_s.

Next steps
1) Record and use the canonical residue decomposition and its corollaries (≥ d components; d = 2 ⇒ translates). 2) Focus on d = 1, a ≥ 3. Set up the finite linear system of Lemma D and search for integer solutions p^1, p^2 with X_1, X_2 a-partition and not translates; start with small m, small a (≥ 3), small N with gcd 1. 3) If solutions appear, attempt to realize phases respecting (a,0) and (a,α) periodicities; otherwise, develop a Fourier/residue obstruction for d = 1 ruling out non-translate two-component tilings. 4) Formalize irreducibility refinement: show rigorously that each irreducible component lives inside one residue class modulo d.
