Ideas
- We pursue a residue-class obstruction that rules out the desired two-component periodic decomposition when gcd(n_i − n_j) = 1. The key is the identity X_i = Y_i + N for each component (Minkowski sum of integer coordinates of anchors with the Z-support of Ω) and the fact that (a,·)-periodicity makes X_i, Y_i unions of residue classes mod a. In the cyclic group G = Z/aZ we then must partition G into two disjoint sets of the special form Y + S and (G\Y) + S, where S = N mod a. When the subgroup generated by S − S equals all of G (which holds if gcd(n_i − n_j) = 1), such a disjoint partition is impossible.

Rigorous lemmas
Lemma 1 (Minkowski support for a component). Let Ω = ⋃_{j=1}^m {n_j} × I_j and T_i ⊂ Z × S^1 with Ω ⊕ T_i = X_i × S^1. Write Y_i := proj_Z(T_i). Then X_i = Y_i + N, where N := {n_1,…,n_m} ⊂ Z and + is Minkowski sum in Z.
Proof. If n ∈ X_i, then the fiber {n}×S^1 is fully covered by Ω ⊕ T_i, so there is at least one anchor t ∈ T_i and some j with n = t_Z + n_j; hence n ∈ Y_i + N. Conversely, if n ∈ Y_i + N, there exists t ∈ T_i and j with n = t_Z + n_j, so Ω + t contributes a subinterval of positive measure to the fiber {n}×S^1. Since Ω ⊕ T_i equals either the full circle or the empty set on that fiber, it must be the full circle, hence n ∈ X_i. ∎

Lemma 2 (Residue-level identity under periodicity). If T_i is (a,β_i)-periodic, then Y_i and X_i are a-periodic subsets of Z. Let G := Z/aZ and S := N mod a. Denoting reductions mod a by bars, one has X̄_i = Ȳ_i + S (sum in G).
Proof. (a,β_i)-periodicity implies T_i + (a,β_i) = T_i, hence proj_Z(T_i) is a-periodic; then by Lemma 1 so is X_i. Reducing Lemma 1 mod a yields X̄_i = Ȳ_i + S. ∎

Lemma 3 (Overlap in cyclic groups). Let G be a finite cyclic group, S ⊂ G, and D := S − S. If ⟨D⟩ = G, then for any nontrivial Y ⊂ G, (Y + S) ∩ ((G \ Y) + S) ≠ ∅.
Proof. Pick y ∈ Y and y′ ∈ G \ Y. Since ⟨D⟩ = G, there exist s,s′ ∈ S with s − s′ = y′ − y. Then y + s = y′ + s′ lies in both Y + S and (G \ Y) + S. ∎

Proposition (No two periodic components when gcd(n_i − n_j) = 1). Let d := gcd{n_i − n_j}. Suppose d = 1. There is no tiling Ω ⊕ T = Z × S^1 that admits an irreducible decomposition T = T_1 ⊔ T_2 with both T_1 and T_2 (a,·)-periodic (e.g., (a,0) and (a,α) with α irrational), and Ω ⊕ T_i = X_i × S^1, with X_1, X_2 disjoint and X_1 ⊔ X_2 = Z.
Proof. By Lemma 2, X̄_i = Ȳ_i + S in G = Z/aZ, with S = N mod a. Since d = 1, the subgroup of Z generated by {n_i − n_j} is all of Z; reducing modulo a gives ⟨S − S⟩ = G. Apply Lemma 3 with Y = Ȳ_1 to obtain (Ȳ_1 + S) ∩ ((G \ Ȳ_1) + S) ≠ ∅, i.e., X̄_1 ∩ X̄_2 ≠ ∅. Hence X_1 and X_2 overlap on Z (periodically), contradicting disjointness. ∎

Consequences for the problem
- The requested configuration (two components with T_1 (a,0)-periodic, T_2 (a,α)-periodic, α irrational, and X_1, X_2 not translates) cannot occur for any Ω with gcd(n_i − n_j) = 1. This is stronger than “not a column”: it rules out any such two-component periodic decomposition.
- Combined with the canonical d-decomposition (Notes), a two-component irreducible decomposition forces d ≤ 2. If d = 2, the two X-sets are the two residue classes modulo 2 (translates). Thus the problem’s hypotheses (two components, not translates) force d = 1, which our proposition rules out. Hence answer: No.

Examples
- Take N = {0,1}. For any a, S − S = {−1,0,1} generates G, so the obstruction applies: no two periodic components exist. A naive attempt with a = 3 and choosing X_1 one residue class fails exactly because X̄_1 = Ȳ_1 + {0,1} cannot be disjoint from X̄_2.

Obstacles/checks
- The crucial identity X_i = Y_i + N uses that Ω ⊕ T_i equals X_i × S^1 fiberwise (not merely “subset”); this is guaranteed by the definition of irreducible decomposition.
- The argument is independent of interval lengths and of α; irrationality plays no role.

Next steps
- Formalize the canonical d-decomposition and note that with d = 2 the only two-component option yields translates. Conclude a succinct no-go theorem for the problem.
- Explore relaxations: allow one component nonperiodic, or allow three or more periodic components; the residue obstruction becomes a packing/covering problem Y_1 + S, …, Y_k + S partition G. Characterize S for which such partitions exist (tilings of groups by translates).
