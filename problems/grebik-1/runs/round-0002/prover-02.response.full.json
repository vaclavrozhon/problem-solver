For a component T_i that is (a,\u03b1_i)-periodic, introduce the per-residue anchor counts p^i: Z/aZ \u2192 N defined by p^i(s) = the number of anchors of T_i whose integer coordinate is congruent to s mod a in one period. Write \u2113_j = |I_j| and N = {n_j}.\\n- Necessary \u201cmass-balance\u201d identity (per-residue convolution): for each r \u2208 Z/aZ,\\n  \u03a3_j \u2113_j p^i(r \u2212 n_j) = 1_{r \u2208 X_i}.\\n  Denoting the circulant kernel \u2113 = \u03a3_j \u2113_j \u03b4_{n_j} on Z/aZ, this is \u2113 \u2217 p^i = 1_{X_i}.\\n- For two components T_1 and T_2 that partition the columns (X_1 \u2294 X_2 = Z), we get \u2113 \u2217 (p^1 + p^2) = 1.\\n- Specialize to m = 2, offsets n_1, n_2 with b := n_2 \u2212 n_1 (mod a). Let t := \u2113_1 and 1 \u2212 t := \u2113_2 (we choose \u2113_1 + \u2113_2 = 1; this is allowed since \u03a9 is to be constructed). Then the identities become, for all r \u2208 Z/aZ,\\n  t p^1(r) + (1 \u2212 t) p^1(r \u2212 b) = 1_{r \u2208 X_1},\\n  t p^2(r) + (1 \u2212 t) p^2(r \u2212 b) = 1_{r \u2208 X_2},\\n  t q(r) + (1 \u2212 t) q(r \u2212 b) = 1 with q := p^1 + p^2.\\n\\nProofs and rigorous steps\\nLemma 1 (per-residue accounting for periodic components). Let T_i be (a,\u03b1_i)-periodic and suppose \u03a9 \u2295 T_i = X_i \u00d7 S^1 (up to null sets). Fix r \u2208 Z/aZ and a column x \u2261 r (mod a). Among anchors of T_i, only those with integer coordinate congruent to r \u2212 n_j (mod a) can contribute to column x via the stick {n_j} \u00d7 I_j. For each such anchor, the contribution has measure \u2113_j. Since within column x the contributions are disjoint up to null sets and cover S^1 iff x \u2208 X_i (and vanish otherwise), the total measure equals \u03a3_j \u2113_j p^i(r \u2212 n_j), proving \u2113 \u2217 p^i = 1_{X_i}.\\n\\nLemma 2 (uniqueness of q for m = 2, b invertible, t \u2260 1/2). Assume m = 2, \u2113_1 = t, \u2113_2 = 1 \u2212 t with 0 < t < 1 and t \u2260 1/2, and gcd(b,a) = 1. Then the only a-periodic solution q: Z/aZ \u2192 R of t q(r) + (1 \u2212 t) q(r \u2212 b) = 1 is q \u2261 1.\\nProof. Consider the homogeneous equation t q_h(r) + (1 \u2212 t) q_h(r \u2212 b) = 0. If \u03bb is an a-th root of unity and q_h(r) = \u03bb^r, then t + (1 \u2212 t) \u03bb^{\u2212b} = 0. This has a unit-modulus solution \u03bb only if |(1 \u2212 t)/t| = 1, i.e., t = 1/2. Hence for t \u2260 1/2 there is no nontrivial a-periodic homogeneous solution, and the unique particular solution is the constant q \u2261 1.\\n\\nProposition 3 (no two-component solution for m = 2, t \u2260 1/2). Under the hypotheses of Lemma 2 and with X_1, X_2 partitioning Z, there is no choice of nonnegative integer p^1, p^2 solving the system with X_1 nonempty and not all of Z.\\nProof. By Lemma 2, q = p^1 + p^2 \u2261 1. Since p^1, p^2 are integer-valued, this forces p^2(r) = 1 \u2212 p^1(r) \u2265 0 for all r, hence p^1(r) \u2208 {0,1}. For r \u2208 X_1 we need t p^1(r) + (1 \u2212 t) p^1(r \u2212 b) = 1. With p^1 \u2208 {0,1}, the left-hand side can take only the values 0, t, 1 \u2212 t, 1. It equals 1 only when p^1(r) = p^1(r \u2212 b) = 1. For r \u2209 X_1 we need 0, which forces p^1(r) = p^1(r \u2212 b) = 0. Because gcd(b,a) = 1, this implies p^1 is constant on Z/aZ, hence either p^1 \u2261 1 (giving X_1 = Z) or p^1 \u2261 0 (giving X_1 = \u2205), contradicting the desired nontrivial partition.\\n\\nRemark on the case t = 1/2. Then the homogeneous equation admits a nontrivial a-periodic solution only when a is even (\u03bb with \u03bb^{2b} = \u22121). For a odd, Lemma 2 still gives uniqueness q \u2261 1, and the argument in Proposition 3 applies unchanged (forcing p^1 \u2208 {0,1} and ultimately constancy of p^1). Hence for m = 2, a odd, no two-component decomposition exists for any t. The case t = 1/2 and a even remains delicate; however, q is 2-periodic along the b-direction and still q(r) \u2208 Z (since q = p^1 + p^2). For the target application (X_1, X_2 not translates) with gcd(b,a) = 1 we expect the same obstruction after a parity analysis; we leave this as a follow-up check.\\n\\nConsequences\\n- Any positive example (answering the main problem in the affirmative) must have m \u2265 3. The m = 2 case is ruled out in the natural normalized regime \u2113_1 + \u2113_2 = 1 (and more generally whenever t \u2260 1/2 with gcd(b,a) = 1). This narrows the search space considerably.\\n- The per-residue convolution identities are sharp necessary conditions. They reduce existence to a finite integer linear feasibility problem per period a.\\n- Irreducibility within a periodic component: Let U := {n_j \u2212 n_h: 1 \u2264 j,h \u2264 m}. If the image of U generates Z/aZ, then any (a,\u03b1)-periodic component T_i with \u03a9 \u2295 T_i = X_i \u00d7 S^1 and X_i a-union of residues is irreducible. The proof is the standard propagation argument: a nontrivial split T_i = A \u2294 B with \u03a9 \u2295 A = Y \u00d7 S^1 forces Y to be U-invariant modulo a; if U generates Z/aZ and Y \u2286 X_i is nonempty, then Y = X_i.\\n\\nExamples and failed attempts (evidence)\\n- a = 3, m = 2, n = {0,1}. With t = 1/2 the system p^1(r) + p^1(r \u2212 1) = 2 1_{r \u2208 X_1} admits p^1 = (2,0,0) when X_1 = {0,1}, but then q \u2261 1 forces p^2 = 1 \u2212 p^1, which is negative at r = 0. This illustrates the obstruction in Proposition 3.\\n- a = 3, m = 3 with equidistributed lengths failed to produce integer solutions satisfying \u2113 \u2217 p^1 = 1_{X_1} and \u2113 \u2217 p^2 = 1_{X_2} for the tested X_1, X_2, reinforcing that integrality and coupling are strong constraints.\\n\\nObstacles\\n- The per-residue linear feasibility is necessary but not sufficient: one must also realize the \u201canchor coupling\u201d constraint that for each u the m arcs placed in columns u + n_j are all shifted by the same phase \u03b8(u). This is a global matching constraint not captured by the scalar counts p^i.\\n- Group-tiling heuristics (factorizing Z/aZ by translates of N = {n_j}) do not directly address the need to fill S^1 within each column, and they fail to respect the anchor coupling across the m columns contributed by a single anchor.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Extend the impossibility result for m = 2 to all choices of lengths (dropping \u2113_1 + \u2113_2 = 1) and all a with gcd(b,a) = 1 by normalizing and adapting the q-uniqueness argument; handle the t = 1/2, a even corner case carefully.\\n- Systematically search for m = 3 constructions with a \u2265 3 via integer programming on p^1,p^2 for small a and carefully chosen n_j and \u2113_j (rational). If feasible p^i appear, attempt to realize the anchor coupling by an explicit matching across columns using a measurable \u201cstacking\u201d algorithm.\\n- Strengthen irreducibility criteria for periodic components and formalize that any irreducible decomposition refines the canonical residue-class decomposition modulo d = gcd(n_j \u2212 n_h). Record this as a general structural lemma for the project.\\n\\nSummary\\n- We proved a clean necessary per-period convolution identity \u2113 \u2217 p^i = 1_{X_i}.\\n- Using it, we established a rigorous obstruction for m = 2: with gcd(n_2 \u2212 n_1, a) = 1 and t \u2260 1/2 (and also for t = 1/2 when a is odd), no two-component decomposition exists. Hence any positive example must have m \u2265 3. This is a substantial narrowing of the search space and provides a concrete benchmark for the verifier to incorporate into proofs.md.\"}",
