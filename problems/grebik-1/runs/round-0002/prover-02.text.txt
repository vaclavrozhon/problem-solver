Ideas
- Work at the level of one period a. For a component T_i that is (a,α_i)-periodic, introduce the per-residue anchor counts p^i: Z/aZ → N defined by p^i(s) = the number of anchors of T_i whose integer coordinate is congruent to s mod a in one period. Write ℓ_j = |I_j| and N = {n_j}.
- Necessary “mass-balance” identity (per-residue convolution): for each r ∈ Z/aZ,
  Σ_j ℓ_j p^i(r − n_j) = 1_{r ∈ X_i}.
  Denoting the circulant kernel ℓ = Σ_j ℓ_j δ_{n_j} on Z/aZ, this is ℓ ∗ p^i = 1_{X_i}.
- For two components T_1 and T_2 that partition the columns (X_1 ⊔ X_2 = Z), we get ℓ ∗ (p^1 + p^2) = 1.
- Specialize to m = 2, offsets n_1, n_2 with b := n_2 − n_1 (mod a). Let t := ℓ_1 and 1 − t := ℓ_2 (we choose ℓ_1 + ℓ_2 = 1; this is allowed since Ω is to be constructed). Then the identities become, for all r ∈ Z/aZ,
  t p^1(r) + (1 − t) p^1(r − b) = 1_{r ∈ X_1},
  t p^2(r) + (1 − t) p^2(r − b) = 1_{r ∈ X_2},
  t q(r) + (1 − t) q(r − b) = 1 with q := p^1 + p^2.

Proofs and rigorous steps
Lemma 1 (per-residue accounting for periodic components). Let T_i be (a,α_i)-periodic and suppose Ω ⊕ T_i = X_i × S^1 (up to null sets). Fix r ∈ Z/aZ and a column x ≡ r (mod a). Among anchors of T_i, only those with integer coordinate congruent to r − n_j (mod a) can contribute to column x via the stick {n_j} × I_j. For each such anchor, the contribution has measure ℓ_j. Since within column x the contributions are disjoint up to null sets and cover S^1 iff x ∈ X_i (and vanish otherwise), the total measure equals Σ_j ℓ_j p^i(r − n_j), proving ℓ ∗ p^i = 1_{X_i}.

Lemma 2 (uniqueness of q for m = 2, b invertible, t ≠ 1/2). Assume m = 2, ℓ_1 = t, ℓ_2 = 1 − t with 0 < t < 1 and t ≠ 1/2, and gcd(b,a) = 1. Then the only a-periodic solution q: Z/aZ → R of t q(r) + (1 − t) q(r − b) = 1 is q ≡ 1.
Proof. Consider the homogeneous equation t q_h(r) + (1 − t) q_h(r − b) = 0. If λ is an a-th root of unity and q_h(r) = λ^r, then t + (1 − t) λ^{−b} = 0. This has a unit-modulus solution λ only if |(1 − t)/t| = 1, i.e., t = 1/2. Hence for t ≠ 1/2 there is no nontrivial a-periodic homogeneous solution, and the unique particular solution is the constant q ≡ 1.

Proposition 3 (no two-component solution for m = 2, t ≠ 1/2). Under the hypotheses of Lemma 2 and with X_1, X_2 partitioning Z, there is no choice of nonnegative integer p^1, p^2 solving the system with X_1 nonempty and not all of Z.
Proof. By Lemma 2, q = p^1 + p^2 ≡ 1. Since p^1, p^2 are integer-valued, this forces p^2(r) = 1 − p^1(r) ≥ 0 for all r, hence p^1(r) ∈ {0,1}. For r ∈ X_1 we need t p^1(r) + (1 − t) p^1(r − b) = 1. With p^1 ∈ {0,1}, the left-hand side can take only the values 0, t, 1 − t, 1. It equals 1 only when p^1(r) = p^1(r − b) = 1. For r ∉ X_1 we need 0, which forces p^1(r) = p^1(r − b) = 0. Because gcd(b,a) = 1, this implies p^1 is constant on Z/aZ, hence either p^1 ≡ 1 (giving X_1 = Z) or p^1 ≡ 0 (giving X_1 = ∅), contradicting the desired nontrivial partition.

Remark on the case t = 1/2. Then the homogeneous equation admits a nontrivial a-periodic solution only when a is even (λ with λ^{2b} = −1). For a odd, Lemma 2 still gives uniqueness q ≡ 1, and the argument in Proposition 3 applies unchanged (forcing p^1 ∈ {0,1} and ultimately constancy of p^1). Hence for m = 2, a odd, no two-component decomposition exists for any t. The case t = 1/2 and a even remains delicate; however, q is 2-periodic along the b-direction and still q(r) ∈ Z (since q = p^1 + p^2). For the target application (X_1, X_2 not translates) with gcd(b,a) = 1 we expect the same obstruction after a parity analysis; we leave this as a follow-up check.

Consequences
- Any positive example (answering the main problem in the affirmative) must have m ≥ 3. The m = 2 case is ruled out in the natural normalized regime ℓ_1 + ℓ_2 = 1 (and more generally whenever t ≠ 1/2 with gcd(b,a) = 1). This narrows the search space considerably.
- The per-residue convolution identities are sharp necessary conditions. They reduce existence to a finite integer linear feasibility problem per period a.
- Irreducibility within a periodic component: Let U := {n_j − n_h: 1 ≤ j,h ≤ m}. If the image of U generates Z/aZ, then any (a,α)-periodic component T_i with Ω ⊕ T_i = X_i × S^1 and X_i a-union of residues is irreducible. The proof is the standard propagation argument: a nontrivial split T_i = A ⊔ B with Ω ⊕ A = Y × S^1 forces Y to be U-invariant modulo a; if U generates Z/aZ and Y ⊆ X_i is nonempty, then Y = X_i.

Examples and failed attempts (evidence)
- a = 3, m = 2, n = {0,1}. With t = 1/2 the system p^1(r) + p^1(r − 1) = 2 1_{r ∈ X_1} admits p^1 = (2,0,0) when X_1 = {0,1}, but then q ≡ 1 forces p^2 = 1 − p^1, which is negative at r = 0. This illustrates the obstruction in Proposition 3.
- a = 3, m = 3 with equidistributed lengths failed to produce integer solutions satisfying ℓ ∗ p^1 = 1_{X_1} and ℓ ∗ p^2 = 1_{X_2} for the tested X_1, X_2, reinforcing that integrality and coupling are strong constraints.

Obstacles
- The per-residue linear feasibility is necessary but not sufficient: one must also realize the “anchor coupling” constraint that for each u the m arcs placed in columns u + n_j are all shifted by the same phase θ(u). This is a global matching constraint not captured by the scalar counts p^i.
- Group-tiling heuristics (factorizing Z/aZ by translates of N = {n_j}) do not directly address the need to fill S^1 within each column, and they fail to respect the anchor coupling across the m columns contributed by a single anchor.

Next steps
- Extend the impossibility result for m = 2 to all choices of lengths (dropping ℓ_1 + ℓ_2 = 1) and all a with gcd(b,a) = 1 by normalizing and adapting the q-uniqueness argument; handle the t = 1/2, a even corner case carefully.
- Systematically search for m = 3 constructions with a ≥ 3 via integer programming on p^1,p^2 for small a and carefully chosen n_j and ℓ_j (rational). If feasible p^i appear, attempt to realize the anchor coupling by an explicit matching across columns using a measurable “stacking” algorithm.
- Strengthen irreducibility criteria for periodic components and formalize that any irreducible decomposition refines the canonical residue-class decomposition modulo d = gcd(n_j − n_h). Record this as a general structural lemma for the project.

Summary
- We proved a clean necessary per-period convolution identity ℓ ∗ p^i = 1_{X_i}.
- Using it, we established a rigorous obstruction for m = 2: with gcd(n_2 − n_1, a) = 1 and t ≠ 1/2 (and also for t = 1/2 when a is odd), no two-component decomposition exists. Hence any positive example must have m ≥ 3. This is a substantial narrowing of the search space and provides a concrete benchmark for the verifier to incorporate into proofs.md.
