I highlight specific places needing precision, fix minor errors, and add several necessary conditions (all testable) that follow from the current framework. I also point out a major gap: coherence of S^1-phases across columns is not yet addressed by the linear constraints.\\n\\nCorrections and clarifications needed\\n1) Notation/typos.\\n- Periodicity: \u201cA is (a,\u03b1)-periodic if T+(a,\u03b1)=T\u201d should read A+(a,\u03b1)=A.\\n- Irreducible: \u201cX_i = X_i^0 \u2294 X^1_0\u201d should be X_i = X_i^0 \u2294 X_i^1.\\n- In the problem, \u201cT=T_1 \u2294 T_2 and X = X_1 \u2294 X_2\u201d should read Z = X_1 \u2294 X_2.\\n- \u201c\u03b1 > 0 irrational\u201d on S^1 should be \u03b1 \u2208 R/Z of infinite order (irrational).\\n\\n2) Measurability and null sets.\\n- State explicitly: we use counting \u00d7 Lebesgue measure; all sets are measurable; equalities and disjointness are mod null sets. This legitimizes \u201cdisjoint union up to null sets\u201d.\\n\\n3) Intervals.\\n- Specify intervals as half-open arcs [x,y) in R/Z; allow wrap-around. Assume nondegenerate (positive length) to avoid zero-length pathologies.\\n\\n4) Per-column finiteness is automatic.\\n- Current notes invoke \u201clocal finiteness.\u201d In fact, it is a consequence of disjointness and positive lengths: In any fixed column n and fixed j, all contributing arcs have common length |I_j|, so there are at most \u230a1/|I_j|\u230b of them; summing over j gives a finite bound per column. Consequence: for each fixed integer s, the number of anchors in T with integer part s is finite (indeed bounded by min_j \u230a1/|I_j|\u230b), since each such anchor yields an arc in each column s+n_j.\\n\\n5) Canonical residue-class decomposition by d.\\n- The statement \u201c\u03a9 \u2295 T_r = X_r \u00d7 S^1\u201d with r \u2208 Z/dZ (where T_r := {t \u2208 T : t_Z \u2261 r (mod d)} and X_r := {x \u2208 Z : x \u2261 r + n_1 (mod d)}) is correct. Proof sketch: For any contributor (t,j) to a column n, we have n \u2261 t_Z + n_j \u2261 t_Z + n_1 (mod d), so contributors to any fixed residue class of columns come only from the corresponding T_r. Since \u03a9 \u2295 T covers all columns, \u03a9 \u2295 T_r covers exactly those columns in residue r + n_1.\\n- Therefore any irreducible component must be contained in a single residue class modulo d. In particular, an irreducible decomposition has at least d components; if there are exactly two components and d = 2, then their X-sets are the two residue classes (translates), contradicting \u201cX_1, X_2 not translates.\u201d Hence the main problem necessarily has d = 1 and a \u2265 3.\\n\\n6) Periodicity \u21d2 a-periodicity of X_i and identity X_i = Y_i + N.\\n- If \u03a9 \u2295 T_i = X_i \u00d7 S^1 and T_i is (a,\u03b1)-periodic, then \u03a9 \u2295 T_i = (X_i + a) \u00d7 S^1, so X_i is a-periodic. Let Y_i := proj_Z(T_i), N := {n_1,\u2026,n_m}. Then X_i = Y_i + N (Minkowski sum). Proof is standard and should be recorded formally.\\n\\n7) Per-residue linear system: a careful formulation.\\n- Fix a \u2265 1, define \u2113_j := |I_j| and f \u2208 R^{Z/aZ} by f(u) := \u03a3_{j : n_j \u2261 u (mod a)} \u2113_j. For an (a,\u03b1)-periodic component T_i, define p^i \u2208 (Z_{\u22650})^{Z/aZ} by p^i_s := number of anchors in T_i with integer part congruent to s (mod a) in a fixed complete residue set {0,\u2026,a\u22121}. Finiteness is justified in (4).\\n- Then for each residue r \u2208 Z/aZ,\\n  (f * p^i)(r) = \u03a3_{u\u2208Z/aZ} f(u) p^i_{r\u2212u} = 1 if r \u2208 R_i and 0 otherwise,\\n  where R_i \u2282 Z/aZ is the set of residues appearing in X_i modulo a. Summing over i yields f * (p^1 + p^2) = 1 (the constant-1 function on Z/aZ). Additionally, coordinate-wise p^i \u2264 p^1 + p^2.\\n- These are necessary conditions (independent of \u03b1), and they are finite and checkable.\\n\\nNew necessary constraints (record as lemmas)\\nLemma E (size/count relation). Let L := \u03a3_j \u2113_j and q := p^1 + p^2. Then L \u03a3_s p^i_s = |R_i| for i = 1,2, and L \u03a3_s q_s = a.\\nProof. Sum (f * p^i)(r) over r to get \u03a3_r \u03a3_u f(u)p^i_{r\u2212u} = \u03a3_u f(u) \u03a3_r p^i_{r\u2212u} = (\u03a3_u f(u)) (\u03a3_s p^i_s) = L \u03a3_s p^i_s, while the RHS sums to |R_i|. Summing over i gives the second identity.\\nCorollaries:\\n- L must be rational. More precisely, L divides both |R_1| and |R_2| in Q, so the denominator of L divides gcd(|R_1|,|R_2|). If gcd(|R_1|,|R_2|) = 1 (e.g., a prime a with 1 \u2264 |R_1| \u2264 a\u22121), then L \u2208 Z and moreover L | a.\\n- If f is constant (e.g., N projects onto all residues mod a with equal total weight per residue), then f * p^i is constant in r. Hence no nontrivial partition with 0 < |R_i| < a is possible. Thus f must be nonconstant for the desired two-component decomposition.\\n\\nFourier-analytic rephrasing (to be developed)\\n- On the finite group Z/aZ, take the discrete Fourier transform. For each frequency k, \\n  \u02c6f(k) \u02c6p^i(k) = \u02c61_{R_i}(k), and \u02c6f(k)(\u02c6p^1(k)+\u02c6p^2(k)) = \u02c61(k) = 0 for k \u2260 0.\\n- If \u02c6f(k) \u2260 0 for all k \u2260 0, then \u02c6p^1(k) = \u02c61_{R_1}(k)/\u02c6f(k), etc., which strongly constrains p^i (e.g., integrality/nonnegativity after inverse transform). This suggests a path to a no-go theorem for certain N (full spectrum f) or to a construction when \u02c6f vanishes on some frequencies.\\n\\nExamples and checks\\n- Toy obstruction (verified): m=2, N={0,1}, \u2113_1=\u2113_2=1/2, a=3. Try R_1={0}. The per-residue equations for i=1 force p^1_0=p^1_1=p^1_2=0 and then contradict at r=0. Hence impossible.\\n- Stronger: With the same data and any choice of R_1 proper, one can solve f * p^1 = 1_{R_1} (e.g., p^1=[0,2,0] if R_1={1,2}), but then f*(p^1+p^2)=1 forces p^2 to have a negative coordinate, contradicting p^2 \u2265 0. Thus this parameter choice cannot realize a two-component decomposition with R_1 nontrivial. This illustrates the necessity of solving simultaneously for p^1 and p^2 with the inequality p^i \u2264 q.\\n\\nKey gap: phase coherence on S^1\\n- The linear system only encodes measures per column and residue. A full construction must globally choose angles so that: (i) within each column, the arcs are disjoint and cover S^1; (ii) for each anchor t, its m arcs across columns s+n_j share the same angle shift t_y; (iii) T_1 has (a,0)-periodicity and T_2 has (a,\u03b1)-periodicity. This is a nontrivial combinatorial coupling across columns via the map y \u21a6 y (T_1) and y \u21a6 y+k\u03b1 (T_2). The current notes do not yet address this coherence. It is a critical missing piece for any positive construction and could also yield further obstructions.\\n\\nObstacles and open items\\n- Irreducibility: Beyond the residue decomposition, a criterion in terms of the connectivity graph with edges in N\u2212N should be formulated. Irreducibility should correspond to connectedness of the graph induced on Y_i by edges y\u2192y+(n\u2212n\u2032). This is not yet formalized.\\n- Fourier constraints: Turning the nonvanishing of \u02c6f(k) (k\u22600) into a rigidity statement (e.g., only translate-type decompositions) remains to be proved.\\n- Non-columnicity: A structural characterization of \u03a9 that are not columns is missing. Likely depends on N (e.g., generated differences) but needs proof.\\n\\nNext steps (specific, testable)\\n1) Formal proofs to add to proofs.md: (i) canonical residue decomposition by d and the refinement property for irreducible components; (ii) per-column finiteness; (iii) periodicity \u21d2 X_i a-periodic and X_i = Y_i + N; (iv) convolution identity f * p^i = 1_{R_i}; (v) Lemma E and its corollaries (rationality of L, divisibility constraints; f nonconstant necessity).\\n2) Search over small parameters with d=1 and a\u22653: Fix m, N, \u2113 (prefer rational), and attempt to solve the integer system f * p^1 = 1_{R_1}, f * p^2 = 1_{R_2}, f * (p^1+p^2) = 1 with p^i \u2265 0 and p^i \u2264 p^1+p^2. If no solutions for many small cases, hypothesize a general obstruction (to be proved via Fourier).\\n3) Phase-coherence lemma: Given integer solutions p^i, attempt to construct T_i by specifying anchor angles in one period and extending by periodicity, ensuring disjointness per column. Reduce to a matching problem on a finite bipartite graph across the m offsets. If a general constructive lemma succeeds, it will bridge the gap from measure constraints to actual tilings.\\n4) Irreducibility criterion: Prove that if the induced graph on Y_i with edges y\u2192y+(n\u2212n\u2032) is connected then (T_i,X_i) is irreducible; conversely, a nontrivial partition of Y_i into edge-separated subsets yields a reducible decomposition.\\n\\nConclusion\\n- The current framework is basically correct but needs precision (typos, measurability, per-column finiteness). The convolution formulation yields several new necessary constraints (Lemma E, f nonconstant, Fourier viewpoint). A key missing ingredient is a phase-coherence construction/obstruction; addressing it is essential for either constructing a desired example or proving impossibility in the d=1, a\u22653 regime.\"}",
