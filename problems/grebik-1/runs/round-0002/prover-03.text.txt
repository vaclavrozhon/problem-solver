Ideas: audit of the current writeup and sharpened necessary conditions
- The high-level structural framework (measure, residue-class decomposition by d := gcd(n_j − n_h), periodicity implications, and per-residue linear constraints) is sound and very useful. I highlight specific places needing precision, fix minor errors, and add several necessary conditions (all testable) that follow from the current framework. I also point out a major gap: coherence of S^1-phases across columns is not yet addressed by the linear constraints.

Corrections and clarifications needed
1) Notation/typos.
- Periodicity: “A is (a,α)-periodic if T+(a,α)=T” should read A+(a,α)=A.
- Irreducible: “X_i = X_i^0 ⊔ X^1_0” should be X_i = X_i^0 ⊔ X_i^1.
- In the problem, “T=T_1 ⊔ T_2 and X = X_1 ⊔ X_2” should read Z = X_1 ⊔ X_2.
- “α > 0 irrational” on S^1 should be α ∈ R/Z of infinite order (irrational).

2) Measurability and null sets.
- State explicitly: we use counting × Lebesgue measure; all sets are measurable; equalities and disjointness are mod null sets. This legitimizes “disjoint union up to null sets”.

3) Intervals.
- Specify intervals as half-open arcs [x,y) in R/Z; allow wrap-around. Assume nondegenerate (positive length) to avoid zero-length pathologies.

4) Per-column finiteness is automatic.
- Current notes invoke “local finiteness.” In fact, it is a consequence of disjointness and positive lengths: In any fixed column n and fixed j, all contributing arcs have common length |I_j|, so there are at most ⌊1/|I_j|⌋ of them; summing over j gives a finite bound per column. Consequence: for each fixed integer s, the number of anchors in T with integer part s is finite (indeed bounded by min_j ⌊1/|I_j|⌋), since each such anchor yields an arc in each column s+n_j.

5) Canonical residue-class decomposition by d.
- The statement “Ω ⊕ T_r = X_r × S^1” with r ∈ Z/dZ (where T_r := {t ∈ T : t_Z ≡ r (mod d)} and X_r := {x ∈ Z : x ≡ r + n_1 (mod d)}) is correct. Proof sketch: For any contributor (t,j) to a column n, we have n ≡ t_Z + n_j ≡ t_Z + n_1 (mod d), so contributors to any fixed residue class of columns come only from the corresponding T_r. Since Ω ⊕ T covers all columns, Ω ⊕ T_r covers exactly those columns in residue r + n_1.
- Therefore any irreducible component must be contained in a single residue class modulo d. In particular, an irreducible decomposition has at least d components; if there are exactly two components and d = 2, then their X-sets are the two residue classes (translates), contradicting “X_1, X_2 not translates.” Hence the main problem necessarily has d = 1 and a ≥ 3.

6) Periodicity ⇒ a-periodicity of X_i and identity X_i = Y_i + N.
- If Ω ⊕ T_i = X_i × S^1 and T_i is (a,α)-periodic, then Ω ⊕ T_i = (X_i + a) × S^1, so X_i is a-periodic. Let Y_i := proj_Z(T_i), N := {n_1,…,n_m}. Then X_i = Y_i + N (Minkowski sum). Proof is standard and should be recorded formally.

7) Per-residue linear system: a careful formulation.
- Fix a ≥ 1, define ℓ_j := |I_j| and f ∈ R^{Z/aZ} by f(u) := Σ_{j : n_j ≡ u (mod a)} ℓ_j. For an (a,α)-periodic component T_i, define p^i ∈ (Z_{≥0})^{Z/aZ} by p^i_s := number of anchors in T_i with integer part congruent to s (mod a) in a fixed complete residue set {0,…,a−1}. Finiteness is justified in (4).
- Then for each residue r ∈ Z/aZ,
  (f * p^i)(r) = Σ_{u∈Z/aZ} f(u) p^i_{r−u} = 1 if r ∈ R_i and 0 otherwise,
  where R_i ⊂ Z/aZ is the set of residues appearing in X_i modulo a. Summing over i yields f * (p^1 + p^2) = 1 (the constant-1 function on Z/aZ). Additionally, coordinate-wise p^i ≤ p^1 + p^2.
- These are necessary conditions (independent of α), and they are finite and checkable.

New necessary constraints (record as lemmas)
Lemma E (size/count relation). Let L := Σ_j ℓ_j and q := p^1 + p^2. Then L Σ_s p^i_s = |R_i| for i = 1,2, and L Σ_s q_s = a.
Proof. Sum (f * p^i)(r) over r to get Σ_r Σ_u f(u)p^i_{r−u} = Σ_u f(u) Σ_r p^i_{r−u} = (Σ_u f(u)) (Σ_s p^i_s) = L Σ_s p^i_s, while the RHS sums to |R_i|. Summing over i gives the second identity.
Corollaries:
- L must be rational. More precisely, L divides both |R_1| and |R_2| in Q, so the denominator of L divides gcd(|R_1|,|R_2|). If gcd(|R_1|,|R_2|) = 1 (e.g., a prime a with 1 ≤ |R_1| ≤ a−1), then L ∈ Z and moreover L | a.
- If f is constant (e.g., N projects onto all residues mod a with equal total weight per residue), then f * p^i is constant in r. Hence no nontrivial partition with 0 < |R_i| < a is possible. Thus f must be nonconstant for the desired two-component decomposition.

Fourier-analytic rephrasing (to be developed)
- On the finite group Z/aZ, take the discrete Fourier transform. For each frequency k, 
  ˆf(k) ˆp^i(k) = ˆ1_{R_i}(k), and ˆf(k)(ˆp^1(k)+ˆp^2(k)) = ˆ1(k) = 0 for k ≠ 0.
- If ˆf(k) ≠ 0 for all k ≠ 0, then ˆp^1(k) = ˆ1_{R_1}(k)/ˆf(k), etc., which strongly constrains p^i (e.g., integrality/nonnegativity after inverse transform). This suggests a path to a no-go theorem for certain N (full spectrum f) or to a construction when ˆf vanishes on some frequencies.

Examples and checks
- Toy obstruction (verified): m=2, N={0,1}, ℓ_1=ℓ_2=1/2, a=3. Try R_1={0}. The per-residue equations for i=1 force p^1_0=p^1_1=p^1_2=0 and then contradict at r=0. Hence impossible.
- Stronger: With the same data and any choice of R_1 proper, one can solve f * p^1 = 1_{R_1} (e.g., p^1=[0,2,0] if R_1={1,2}), but then f*(p^1+p^2)=1 forces p^2 to have a negative coordinate, contradicting p^2 ≥ 0. Thus this parameter choice cannot realize a two-component decomposition with R_1 nontrivial. This illustrates the necessity of solving simultaneously for p^1 and p^2 with the inequality p^i ≤ q.

Key gap: phase coherence on S^1
- The linear system only encodes measures per column and residue. A full construction must globally choose angles so that: (i) within each column, the arcs are disjoint and cover S^1; (ii) for each anchor t, its m arcs across columns s+n_j share the same angle shift t_y; (iii) T_1 has (a,0)-periodicity and T_2 has (a,α)-periodicity. This is a nontrivial combinatorial coupling across columns via the map y ↦ y (T_1) and y ↦ y+kα (T_2). The current notes do not yet address this coherence. It is a critical missing piece for any positive construction and could also yield further obstructions.

Obstacles and open items
- Irreducibility: Beyond the residue decomposition, a criterion in terms of the connectivity graph with edges in N−N should be formulated. Irreducibility should correspond to connectedness of the graph induced on Y_i by edges y→y+(n−n′). This is not yet formalized.
- Fourier constraints: Turning the nonvanishing of ˆf(k) (k≠0) into a rigidity statement (e.g., only translate-type decompositions) remains to be proved.
- Non-columnicity: A structural characterization of Ω that are not columns is missing. Likely depends on N (e.g., generated differences) but needs proof.

Next steps (specific, testable)
1) Formal proofs to add to proofs.md: (i) canonical residue decomposition by d and the refinement property for irreducible components; (ii) per-column finiteness; (iii) periodicity ⇒ X_i a-periodic and X_i = Y_i + N; (iv) convolution identity f * p^i = 1_{R_i}; (v) Lemma E and its corollaries (rationality of L, divisibility constraints; f nonconstant necessity).
2) Search over small parameters with d=1 and a≥3: Fix m, N, ℓ (prefer rational), and attempt to solve the integer system f * p^1 = 1_{R_1}, f * p^2 = 1_{R_2}, f * (p^1+p^2) = 1 with p^i ≥ 0 and p^i ≤ p^1+p^2. If no solutions for many small cases, hypothesize a general obstruction (to be proved via Fourier).
3) Phase-coherence lemma: Given integer solutions p^i, attempt to construct T_i by specifying anchor angles in one period and extending by periodicity, ensuring disjointness per column. Reduce to a matching problem on a finite bipartite graph across the m offsets. If a general constructive lemma succeeds, it will bridge the gap from measure constraints to actual tilings.
4) Irreducibility criterion: Prove that if the induced graph on Y_i with edges y→y+(n−n′) is connected then (T_i,X_i) is irreducible; conversely, a nontrivial partition of Y_i into edge-separated subsets yields a reducible decomposition.

Conclusion
- The current framework is basically correct but needs precision (typos, measurability, per-column finiteness). The convolution formulation yields several new necessary constraints (Lemma E, f nonconstant, Fourier viewpoint). A key missing ingredient is a phase-coherence construction/obstruction; addressing it is essential for either constructing a desired example or proving impossibility in the d=1, a≥3 regime.
