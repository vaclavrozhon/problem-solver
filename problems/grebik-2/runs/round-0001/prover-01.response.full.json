This allows a clean decomposition of columns by residue classes mod a.\\n- Ensure \u03a9 is not a column by forcing every component X in any irreducible decomposition to be infinite. A robust mechanism is: if the lengths of the two intervals are Q-linearly independent, then in any fiber one must use exactly one copy of each interval (disjointly) to reach measure 1. Because each (n,\u03b8) contributes to two columns (n and n+a), this forces closure under \u00b1a and hence infinitude of X.\\n- Try to realize 3 components with period a (take a=3), having (3,0)-, (3,\u03b1)-, (3,\u03b2)-periodicity, with \u03b1,\u03b2 irrational and \u03b2\u2209Q+\u03b1Q. Construct T as a union of three orbits modulo 3.\\n\\nA precise necessary lemma\\nLemma (no finite irreducible components for S={0,a} if lengths are Q-independent). Let \u03a9 = ({0}\u00d7I) \u222a ({a}\u00d7J) where |I|=\u2113, |J|=1\u2212\u2113 and assume 1,\u2113 are Q-linearly independent (equivalently, \u2113 is irrational). Suppose \u03a9\u2295T=Z\u00d7S^1 and T=\u2a06_i T_i is an irreducible decomposition with \u03a9\u2295T_i=X_i\u00d7S^1. Then each nonempty X_i is infinite (indeed X_i+a=X_i, hence |X_i|=\u221e).\\nProof. Fix i and y\u2208X_i. Let m_I(y) be the number of arcs of type I used at column y by \u03a9\u2295T_i, and similarly m_J(y). Since the union is disjoint (a.e.) and covers S^1, m_I(y)\u2113 + m_J(y)(1\u2212\u2113) = 1. As 1,\u2113 are Q-linearly independent, the only nonnegative integer solution is m_I(y)=m_J(y)=1. Thus at y there is exactly one (n,\u03b8)\u2208T_i with n=y (contributing I) and exactly one with n=y\u2212a (contributing J). In particular, T_i uses some translate at n=y, which also contributes a J-arc to column y+a; hence y+a\u2208X_i. Similarly, y\u2212a\u2208X_i. Thus X_i is a union of cosets of aZ and is infinite. Irreducibility then forces each X_i to be a union of entire residue classes mod a. \u220e\\n\\nConsequence: \u03a9 with two bars and |I| irrational is not a column. Indeed, in any irreducible decomposition all nonempty X_i are infinite.\\n\\nTarget construction outline (a=3)\\n- Take S={0,3}. We want T=T_1\u2a06T_2\u2a06T_3 and Z= X_1\u2a06X_2\u2a06X_3 with X_r={n\u2208Z: n\u2261r mod 3}.\\n- Periodicities desired: T_1 is (3,0)-periodic; T_2 is (3,\u03b1)-periodic; T_3 is (3,\u03b2)-periodic, with \u03b1,\u03b2 irrational and \u03b2\u2209Q+\u03b1Q.\\n- We need \u03a9 to allow, at each y\u2208X_r, a disjoint union (a.e.) of arcs of total length 1 coming from the two bars at positions y and y\u22123. By the lemma, with |I| irrational, per column we must use exactly one I-arc (from n=y) and one J-arc (from n=y\u22123). The second coordinates (angles) used at y and y\u22123 may differ; disjointness and full coverage force a geometric constraint on the relative angle difference.\\n\\nGeometric compatibility constraint\\nLet I,J\u2282S^1 be intervals of lengths \u2113 and 1\u2212\u2113. Fix a difference \u03b4\u2208S^1. Consider the two sets I and J\u2212\u03b4. Their union equals S^1 (disjoint a.e.) if and only if they are complementary up to endpoints. Equivalently, the right end of one matches the left end of the other, and vice versa. This pins down \u03b4 uniquely by the endpoints of I,J. In particular:\\n- For a given choice of I,J, there is a unique \u03b4\u2208S^1 such that I \u2294 (J\u2212\u03b4) = S^1 (disjoint a.e.). Call this \u03b4=\u03b4(I,J).\\n- Therefore, at a column y, if the I-arc comes from angle \u03b8_y (at n=y) and the J-arc from angle \u03c6_{y\u22123} (at n=y\u22123), disjoint full coverage demands \u03b8_y \u2212 \u03c6_{y\u22123} \u2261 \u03b4(I,J) mod 1.\\n\\nReconciling with periodicities\\nFor T_1 to be (3,0)-periodic, taking \u03b8_y constant along the class X_0, we must have \u03c6_{y\u22123}=\u03b8_y, hence \u03b4(I,J)\u22610. Thus I and J must be complements (no relative rotation) for the class X_0 component.\\nFor T_2 to be (3,\u03b1)-periodic, along X_1 we have \u03b8_{y+3}=\u03b8_y+\u03b1. The coverage condition requires \u03b8_y\u2212\u03c6_{y\u22123}\u2261\u03b4(I,J). But also \u03c6_{y}\u2212\u03c6_{y\u22123} should equal \u03b1 if \u03c6 comes from the same (3,\u03b1)-orbit. Plugging in over consecutive columns forces \u03b4(I,J)\u2261\u03b1. A similar analysis for T_3 imposes \u03b4(I,J)\u2261\u03b2 along X_2.\\nThis reveals a conflict if we use the same pair I,J to serve all three components: we would need \u03b4(I,J) to equal 0, \u03b1, and \u03b2 simultaneously. This cannot happen unless \u03b1\u2261\u03b2\u22610. Hence a single pair S={0,3} cannot simultaneously realize (3,0)-, (3,\u03b1)-, and (3,\u03b2)-components when the same two bars contribute in all classes.\\n\\nWhy the na\u00efve multi-pair fix fails\\nOne might try to add more bars and \u201cassign\u201d disjoint pairs of bars to each component. However, any translate (n,\u03b8) applies to all bars present in \u03a9, not just a chosen pair. Thus contributions from \u201cunassigned\u201d bars would appear and cannot be suppressed, breaking disjointness. Therefore, a construction must ensure that, for each component, the bars that actually contribute at its columns are the only bars present in \u03a9 that can contribute there.\\n\\nConcrete progress: a necessary condition and a no-go for a single pair\\nProposition (no-go for one pair). Let \u03a9=({0}\u00d7I)\u222a({3}\u00d7J) with |I| irrational. If \u03a9 admits a tiling T whose irreducible decomposition T=T_1\u2a06T_2\u2a06T_3 over X_r={n\u2261r mod 3} and T_r are respectively (3,0)-, (3,\u03b1)-, (3,\u03b2)-periodic with \u03b1,\u03b2 irrational, then necessarily \u03b4(I,J) must equal 0, \u03b1, and \u03b2 simultaneously, a contradiction unless \u03b1\u2261\u03b2\u22610.\\nSketch. By the lemma, at each y in a component the coverage uses exactly one I- and one J-arc. The (3,\u03b3)-periodicity on that component forces the angle difference between y and y\u22123 to be \u03b3, while disjoint full coverage demands that angle difference equal \u03b4(I,J). Apply with \u03b3=0,\u03b1,\u03b2 on X_0,X_1,X_2. \u220e\\n\\nConsequences\\n- With two bars, the desired triple of periodicities cannot occur. This is a genuine obstruction extracted from the geometry of two-interval partitions of the circle and the independence of |I|.\\n- The lemma remains a useful structural tool: it shows \u03a9 with two bars and irrational length is not a column, independently of periodicity ambitions.\\n\\nNext steps\\n1) Try m\u22653 bars. The two-interval obstruction disappears because a fiber can be filled by 3 or more arcs; the relative angle constraints become a system which may allow two distinct irrational steps \u03b1,\u03b2. The goal is to design I_1,\u2026,I_m and n_j so that, on each residue class X_r, (i) only a prescribed subset of bars can contribute; (ii) the number of arcs used and their relative angles are compatible with the orbit relation \u03b8_{y+3}=\u03b8_y+\u03b3_r. This suggests using separated supports S_r\u2282{n_j} that are \u201cresidue-class selective,\u201d e.g., S_0={0,3}, S_1={1,4}, S_2={2,5}, but without adding extra bars elsewhere (see the obstruction above). A promising scheme is to take n_j spaced by 3 and to require that at each residue class only those bars can reach its columns (this demands the set of bar heights to be congruent to that residue class only).\\n2) Formalize a general \u201clocal-to-global\u201d linear system: for each residue class r and each y\u2208X_r, the counts vector m(y)\u2208N^m must satisfy \u2211_j m_j(y)|I_j|=1. Add the (3,\u03b3_r)-orbit constraints on angles to force disjointness. Solve for a simple pattern (e.g., constant m(y)=m_r independent of y) yielding a tractable set of equations.\\n3) Maintain the non-column property: arrange the irrationality so that any irreducible component is infinite (use the lemma\u2019s mechanism generalized to m\u22653 via Q-linear independence of a suitable subfamily of lengths).\\n\\nSummary of proven pieces\\n- For \u03a9 with two bars {0,3} and |I| irrational, \u03a9 is not a column (Lemma).\\n- With two bars, the requested 3-component periodic tiling with periods (3,0),(3,\u03b1),(3,\u03b2) (\u03b1,\u03b2 irrational, \u03b2\u2209Q+\u03b1Q) is impossible (Proposition), because the unique angle difference \u03b4(I,J) forced by disjointness would have to equal 0,\u03b1,\u03b2 simultaneously.\\n- The path forward is to move to \u22653 bars and engineer which bars can reach which residue classes, then solve the disjointness-and-periodicity constraints; the lemma gives a way to keep \u03a9 non-column via irrational length constraints.\\n\\nObstacles explicitly identified\\n- Any (n,\u03b8) translates all bars of \u03a9, so \u201cassigning bars\u201d to components is nontrivial; the geometry must ensure only the intended bars can reach the intended columns.\\n- With two bars, the disjointness constraint rigidifies the relative angle difference to a single constant \u03b4(I,J), blocking three distinct periodicities.\\n\"}",
