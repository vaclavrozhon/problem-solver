Ideas
- Work with two “vertical bars” at heights 0 and a, i.e. S = {0,a}, because then every translate (n,θ) of Ω affects only two columns n and n+a. This allows a clean decomposition of columns by residue classes mod a.
- Ensure Ω is not a column by forcing every component X in any irreducible decomposition to be infinite. A robust mechanism is: if the lengths of the two intervals are Q-linearly independent, then in any fiber one must use exactly one copy of each interval (disjointly) to reach measure 1. Because each (n,θ) contributes to two columns (n and n+a), this forces closure under ±a and hence infinitude of X.
- Try to realize 3 components with period a (take a=3), having (3,0)-, (3,α)-, (3,β)-periodicity, with α,β irrational and β∉Q+αQ. Construct T as a union of three orbits modulo 3.

A precise necessary lemma
Lemma (no finite irreducible components for S={0,a} if lengths are Q-independent). Let Ω = ({0}×I) ∪ ({a}×J) where |I|=ℓ, |J|=1−ℓ and assume 1,ℓ are Q-linearly independent (equivalently, ℓ is irrational). Suppose Ω⊕T=Z×S^1 and T=⨆_i T_i is an irreducible decomposition with Ω⊕T_i=X_i×S^1. Then each nonempty X_i is infinite (indeed X_i+a=X_i, hence |X_i|=∞).
Proof. Fix i and y∈X_i. Let m_I(y) be the number of arcs of type I used at column y by Ω⊕T_i, and similarly m_J(y). Since the union is disjoint (a.e.) and covers S^1, m_I(y)ℓ + m_J(y)(1−ℓ) = 1. As 1,ℓ are Q-linearly independent, the only nonnegative integer solution is m_I(y)=m_J(y)=1. Thus at y there is exactly one (n,θ)∈T_i with n=y (contributing I) and exactly one with n=y−a (contributing J). In particular, T_i uses some translate at n=y, which also contributes a J-arc to column y+a; hence y+a∈X_i. Similarly, y−a∈X_i. Thus X_i is a union of cosets of aZ and is infinite. Irreducibility then forces each X_i to be a union of entire residue classes mod a. ∎

Consequence: Ω with two bars and |I| irrational is not a column. Indeed, in any irreducible decomposition all nonempty X_i are infinite.

Target construction outline (a=3)
- Take S={0,3}. We want T=T_1⨆T_2⨆T_3 and Z= X_1⨆X_2⨆X_3 with X_r={n∈Z: n≡r mod 3}.
- Periodicities desired: T_1 is (3,0)-periodic; T_2 is (3,α)-periodic; T_3 is (3,β)-periodic, with α,β irrational and β∉Q+αQ.
- We need Ω to allow, at each y∈X_r, a disjoint union (a.e.) of arcs of total length 1 coming from the two bars at positions y and y−3. By the lemma, with |I| irrational, per column we must use exactly one I-arc (from n=y) and one J-arc (from n=y−3). The second coordinates (angles) used at y and y−3 may differ; disjointness and full coverage force a geometric constraint on the relative angle difference.

Geometric compatibility constraint
Let I,J⊂S^1 be intervals of lengths ℓ and 1−ℓ. Fix a difference δ∈S^1. Consider the two sets I and J−δ. Their union equals S^1 (disjoint a.e.) if and only if they are complementary up to endpoints. Equivalently, the right end of one matches the left end of the other, and vice versa. This pins down δ uniquely by the endpoints of I,J. In particular:
- For a given choice of I,J, there is a unique δ∈S^1 such that I ⊔ (J−δ) = S^1 (disjoint a.e.). Call this δ=δ(I,J).
- Therefore, at a column y, if the I-arc comes from angle θ_y (at n=y) and the J-arc from angle φ_{y−3} (at n=y−3), disjoint full coverage demands θ_y − φ_{y−3} ≡ δ(I,J) mod 1.

Reconciling with periodicities
For T_1 to be (3,0)-periodic, taking θ_y constant along the class X_0, we must have φ_{y−3}=θ_y, hence δ(I,J)≡0. Thus I and J must be complements (no relative rotation) for the class X_0 component.
For T_2 to be (3,α)-periodic, along X_1 we have θ_{y+3}=θ_y+α. The coverage condition requires θ_y−φ_{y−3}≡δ(I,J). But also φ_{y}−φ_{y−3} should equal α if φ comes from the same (3,α)-orbit. Plugging in over consecutive columns forces δ(I,J)≡α. A similar analysis for T_3 imposes δ(I,J)≡β along X_2.
This reveals a conflict if we use the same pair I,J to serve all three components: we would need δ(I,J) to equal 0, α, and β simultaneously. This cannot happen unless α≡β≡0. Hence a single pair S={0,3} cannot simultaneously realize (3,0)-, (3,α)-, and (3,β)-components when the same two bars contribute in all classes.

Why the naïve multi-pair fix fails
One might try to add more bars and “assign” disjoint pairs of bars to each component. However, any translate (n,θ) applies to all bars present in Ω, not just a chosen pair. Thus contributions from “unassigned” bars would appear and cannot be suppressed, breaking disjointness. Therefore, a construction must ensure that, for each component, the bars that actually contribute at its columns are the only bars present in Ω that can contribute there.

Concrete progress: a necessary condition and a no-go for a single pair
Proposition (no-go for one pair). Let Ω=({0}×I)∪({3}×J) with |I| irrational. If Ω admits a tiling T whose irreducible decomposition T=T_1⨆T_2⨆T_3 over X_r={n≡r mod 3} and T_r are respectively (3,0)-, (3,α)-, (3,β)-periodic with α,β irrational, then necessarily δ(I,J) must equal 0, α, and β simultaneously, a contradiction unless α≡β≡0.
Sketch. By the lemma, at each y in a component the coverage uses exactly one I- and one J-arc. The (3,γ)-periodicity on that component forces the angle difference between y and y−3 to be γ, while disjoint full coverage demands that angle difference equal δ(I,J). Apply with γ=0,α,β on X_0,X_1,X_2. ∎

Consequences
- With two bars, the desired triple of periodicities cannot occur. This is a genuine obstruction extracted from the geometry of two-interval partitions of the circle and the independence of |I|.
- The lemma remains a useful structural tool: it shows Ω with two bars and irrational length is not a column, independently of periodicity ambitions.

Next steps
1) Try m≥3 bars. The two-interval obstruction disappears because a fiber can be filled by 3 or more arcs; the relative angle constraints become a system which may allow two distinct irrational steps α,β. The goal is to design I_1,…,I_m and n_j so that, on each residue class X_r, (i) only a prescribed subset of bars can contribute; (ii) the number of arcs used and their relative angles are compatible with the orbit relation θ_{y+3}=θ_y+γ_r. This suggests using separated supports S_r⊂{n_j} that are “residue-class selective,” e.g., S_0={0,3}, S_1={1,4}, S_2={2,5}, but without adding extra bars elsewhere (see the obstruction above). A promising scheme is to take n_j spaced by 3 and to require that at each residue class only those bars can reach its columns (this demands the set of bar heights to be congruent to that residue class only).
2) Formalize a general “local-to-global” linear system: for each residue class r and each y∈X_r, the counts vector m(y)∈N^m must satisfy ∑_j m_j(y)|I_j|=1. Add the (3,γ_r)-orbit constraints on angles to force disjointness. Solve for a simple pattern (e.g., constant m(y)=m_r independent of y) yielding a tractable set of equations.
3) Maintain the non-column property: arrange the irrationality so that any irreducible component is infinite (use the lemma’s mechanism generalized to m≥3 via Q-linear independence of a suitable subfamily of lengths).

Summary of proven pieces
- For Ω with two bars {0,3} and |I| irrational, Ω is not a column (Lemma).
- With two bars, the requested 3-component periodic tiling with periods (3,0),(3,α),(3,β) (α,β irrational, β∉Q+αQ) is impossible (Proposition), because the unique angle difference δ(I,J) forced by disjointness would have to equal 0,α,β simultaneously.
- The path forward is to move to ≥3 bars and engineer which bars can reach which residue classes, then solve the disjointness-and-periodicity constraints; the lemma gives a way to keep Ω non-column via irrational length constraints.

Obstacles explicitly identified
- Any (n,θ) translates all bars of Ω, so “assigning bars” to components is nontrivial; the geometry must ensure only the intended bars can reach the intended columns.
- With two bars, the disjointness constraint rigidifies the relative angle difference to a single constant δ(I,J), blocking three distinct periodicities.
