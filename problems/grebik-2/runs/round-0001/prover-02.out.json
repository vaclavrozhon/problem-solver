  "content": "Ideas\n- Work at the level of horizontal combinatorics (the Z\u2013coordinate) and fiberwise circle-tilings (the S^1\u2013coordinate) separately. Two robust structural facts are extractable and provable now:\n  1) Under (a,\u03b3)-periodicity, each irreducible component\u2019s horizontal support X_i must be a union of residue classes mod a.\n  2) If \u2126 uses at least two distinct horizontal offsets, then \u2126 cannot be a \u201ccolumn\u201d (in the sense of the definition), i.e. there is no tiling having an irreducible component with finite X_i.\n- For the main construction with three components carrying (a,0), (a,\u03b1), (a,\u03b2) for irrational \u03b1,\u03b2 with \u03b2\u2209Q+\u03b1Q, decouple the horizontal and vertical constraints. Horizontally, choose a=3 and X_1\u22610 mod 3, X_2\u22611 mod 3, X_3\u22612 mod 3. Vertically, seek per-component circle partitions at each column. The key obstacle is to realize simultaneously the fiberwise tilings for two incommensurable vertical periods using the same intervals I_j (because the shape \u2126 is fixed). A viable blueprint is to include in \u2126 enough intervals located at offsets \u22610 mod 3 so that each of T_1, T_2, T_3 can use a disjoint \u201cpair\u201d of intervals (in the sense of which offsets they actually impact) while remaining confined to their coset; since all offsets are \u22610 mod 3, no leakage across X_i occurs.\n\nRigorous results we can already record\n1) Periodic support structure.\nLemma 1. Let \u2126 be as in the task, and suppose T_i is (a,\u03b3)-periodic and \u2126\u2295T_i=X_i\u00d7S^1. Then X_i+a=X_i. In particular X_i is a union of residue classes mod a.\nProof. For x\u2208Z, write for each nonzero Fourier mode \u2113 the quantity s_{i,j}(x):=\u2211_{(k,\u03b8)\u2208T_i, k=x-n_j} e^{2\u03c0i\u2113\u03b8}. (As usual, for x\u2209X_i all these sums vanish, since by hypothesis \u2126\u2295T_i has null intersection with {x}\u00d7S^1.) (a,\u03b3)-periodicity gives s_{i,j}(x+a)=e^{2\u03c0i\u2113\u03b3}s_{i,j}(x). Thus if x\u2209X_i then s_{i,j}(x)=0 for all j, hence also s_{i,j}(x+a)=0 for all j, so x+a\u2209X_i as well. Hence X_i+a=X_i.\n\n2) No finite component if \u2126 spans \u22652 horizontal offsets.\nLemma 2 (not-a-column criterion). Let N={n_1,\u2026,n_m}\u2282Z be the horizontal offsets of \u2126, and suppose min N<n_max:=max N. Then there is no tiling T of Z\u00d7S^1 by \u2126 with an irreducible component \u2126\u2295T_i=X_i\u00d7S^1 for which 0<|X_i|<\u221e. Hence \u2126 is not a column.\nProof. Assume \u2126\u2295T_i=X_i\u00d7S^1 with 0<|X_i|<\u221e. Let M:=max X_i. Any tile t=(h,\u03b8)\u2208T_i contributes on the horizontal set h+N. To avoid coverage above M, any tile used in covering M must satisfy h+n\u2264M for all n\u2208N, hence h\u2264M\u2212n_max. To cover M, there must be t with h+n=M for some n\u2208N; by the preceding restriction this forces n=n_max and h=M\u2212n_max. But then t contributes also at h+min N=M\u2212(n_max\u2212min N)<M, whence that smaller column must belong to X_i. Iterating produces the infinite descending chain M\u2212k(n_max\u2212min N)\u2208X_i for all k\u22651, contradicting finiteness of X_i. \u220e\nRemark. This argument is purely horizontal and does not use interval lengths (only that the S^1-contribution of any translate has positive measure on each impacted column), so it applies to all \u2126 with at least two distinct offsets.\n\n3) Horizontal design constraint for irreducible components confined to a single residue class.\nLet N\u2282Z be the set of offsets of \u2126 and D:=\u27e8N\u2212N\u27e9 the subgroup of Z they generate. If T_i satisfies \u2126\u2295T_i=X_i\u00d7S^1 with X_i contained in a union of residue classes mod a, then necessarily X_i is a union of cosets of D in Z/aZ. In particular, if D=3Z and a=3, then the three sets X_1, X_2, X_3 can be taken to be the three residue classes mod 3. (This is the condition that H_i+N\u2286X_i; it forces closure of X_i under addition by differences in N.)\n\nA concrete blueprint toward the desired example\n- Take a=3 and choose N={0,3}. By Lemma 2, any such \u2126 is not a column.\n- Fix X_1=3Z, X_2=3Z+1, X_3=3Z+2; this is compatible with Lemma 1 and with the closure constraint above because N\u2212N\u22823Z.\n- Vertical (fiberwise) tilings for each component reduce to: For each residue class r (hence for each x with x\u2261r mod 3) we must tile S^1 by translates of the two intervals I_0 and I_3 coming from the two offsets 0 and 3. If T_i is (3,\u03b3_i)-periodic, passing from x to x+3 rotates the fiberwise partition by \u03b3_i, which is harmless since S^1 is rotation-invariant. The core is to pick a single pair (I_0,I_3) that can support three fiberwise partitions: one with \u03b3_1=0, one with \u03b3_2=\u03b1, and one with \u03b3_3=\u03b2.\n- A robust solvable subproblem: For a single prescribed \u03b3 and any T\u2208N, there exists a (finite) set P\u2282S^1 and intervals I_0,I_3 with lengths L_0,L_3 satisfying L_0+L_3=1/T such that (I_0+P)\u222a(I_3+P\u2212\u03b3) tiles S^1 a.e. Proof: partition S^1 into T equal arcs [k/T,(k+1)/T). Let j:=\u2308\u03b3T\u2309 and set \u03be:=j/T\u2212\u03b3\u2208(0,1/T]. Take L_0:=\u03be, L_3:=1/T\u2212\u03be, I_0:=[0,L_0), I_3:=[0,L_3), and P:={k/T:0\u2264k<T}. Then in each arc [k/T,(k+1)/T) the unique point of P\u2212\u03b3 lies at k/T+\u03be, so [k/T,k/T+L_0) from I_0+P and [k/T+\u03be,k/T+\u03be+L_3) from I_3+P\u2212\u03b3 exactly partition that arc.\n- Obstruction to simultaneous use of the same (I_0,I_3) for two distinct \u03b3\u2019s: the construction above forces L_0=\u03be(\u03b3)=\u2308\u03b3T\u2309/T\u2212\u03b3, hence equality of L_0 for two different \u03b3 implies \u03b3-differences rational. Since we want \u03b2\u2209Q+\u03b1Q, we cannot impose such equalities naively. This clarifies why the \u201csingle-pair\u201d attempt runs into arithmetic incompatibility.\n- Viable workaround (design sketch, to be turned into a proof): include two pairs of intervals at the same offsets: \u2126 carries four intervals I_0^A,I_3^A and I_0^B,I_3^B (all at offsets 0 and 3), with lengths arranged so that T_2 uses only the A-pair (via the one-\u03b3 construction with \u03b3=\u03b1), T_3 uses only the B-pair (with \u03b3=\u03b2), and T_1 (with \u03b3=0) uses both pairs jointly. Crucially, because both offsets are multiples of 3, all contributions of any translate stay within a single residue class mod 3, so there is no cross-interference across components. The only remaining coupling is vertical inside each component; that is handled by choosing for T_1 a (3,0)-periodic pattern P^A,P^B whose fiberwise union (I_0^A+P^A)\u222a(I_3^A+P^A)\u222a(I_0^B+P^B)\u222a(I_3^B+P^B) tiles S^1. Since we can choose the cardinalities |P^A|,|P^B| freely and s_A+t_A and s_B+t_B arbitrarily (subject to positive lengths) and since S^1 admits arbitrary finite interval partitions, this is a flexible constraint. On X_2 (resp. X_3) we then switch off B (resp. A) at the level of the set of translates (i.e. take T_2 supported only on those vertical phases prescribed by the \u03b1-scheme for the A-pair, and analogously for T_3 and the B-pair). The shape \u2126 is fixed; what changes is which translates we actually place in T_2 or T_3. Because the A- and B-pairs contribute only within their own residue class, the three components do not geometrically conflict across X_1,X_2,X_3.\n\nWhat is proved now vs. what remains\n- Proved now: Lemma 1 (periodicity \u21d2 X_i+a=X_i) and Lemma 2 (if \u2126 uses \u22652 offsets then \u2126 is not a column). These address two structural pieces of the problem and settle the \u201cnot a column\u201d requirement for any \u2126 with at least two distinct horizontal offsets.\n- Constructive existence: For a single irrational \u03b3, the segmentation lemma above gives an explicit way to pick (I_0,I_3) and a finite pattern P so that a (3,\u03b3)-periodic fiberwise tiling exists. The arithmetic obstruction to using the same pair for two incommensurable \u03b3\u2019s is identified; the multi-pair workaround is laid out with precise constraints local to each component and with coset-separation preventing cross-interference.\n\nObstacles\n- The remaining technical point is to pin down an explicit finite choice of A- and B-pairs and (3,0)-periodic P^A,P^B for T_1 that yields a clean fiberwise partition while simultaneously ensuring the \u03b1- and \u03b2-constructions for T_2 and T_3 (which, by the one-\u03b3 lemma, are individually straightforward). This is a finite combinatorial placement problem on S^1 with plenty of degrees of freedom; a direct explicit instance should be obtainable with, say, |P^A|=|P^B|=2 or 3.\n\nNext steps (concrete, checkable)\n- Choose a=3 and offsets N={0,3}. Fix irrationals \u03b1,\u03b2 with \u03b2\u2209Q+\u03b1Q. Pick T_A,T_B (e.g. 2 or 3) and use the one-\u03b3 lemma to produce I_0^A,I_3^A and I_0^B,I_3^B (hence their lengths s_A,t_A and s_B,t_B) together with the periodic vertical sets P^\u03b1,P^\u03b2 furnishing the T_2 and T_3 fiberwise tilings.\n- On X_1, explicitly pick (3,0)-periodic finite sets P^A,P^B so that the four families (I_0^A+P^A),(I_3^A+P^A),(I_0^B+P^B),(I_3^B+P^B) partition S^1. This is a deterministic finite packing problem that can be solved (e.g. by greedy placement) because the total lengths add to 1 and we control the start points. Write out one explicit placement.\n- Verify irreducibility of each T_i: with N={0,3}, every translate used at horizontal coordinate k impacts exactly the two columns k and k+3 in the same X_i. If (by construction) at every k in the residue class we place at least one translate, the bipartite graph (columns versus translates, edges when a translate impacts a column) is connected along the 3-step chain, so any decomposition T_i=T_i^0\u2294T_i^1 forcing \u2126\u2295T_i^j=X_i^j\u00d7S^1 has X_i^j either empty or all of X_i (this is the \u201cedge forcing\u201d argument sketched in the analysis).\n\nSummary\n- The non-column part is settled now via Lemma 2: any \u2126 with \u22652 horizontal offsets cannot admit a finite-column irreducible component.\n- The periodic-support structure (Lemma 1) justifies working with X_i as unions of residue classes mod a.\n- For the existence of the requested decomposition with three incommensurable vertical characters, a concrete scheme with a=3 and offsets N={0,3} is outlined. The one-\u03b3 fiberwise tiling lemma gives T_2 and T_3 immediately once we dedicate two disjoint \u201cpairs\u201d of intervals inside \u2126 to \u03b1 and \u03b2, respectively. The remaining finite placement for T_1 is a flexible packing problem on S^1; producing an explicit placement is the next concretely checkable task. The irreducibility of each T_i follows from the 0/3 adjacency connectivity once at least one translate is present at every horizontal site in the corresponding residue class."
