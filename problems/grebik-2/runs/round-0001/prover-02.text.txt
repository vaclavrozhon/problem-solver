Ideas
- Work at the level of horizontal combinatorics (the Z–coordinate) and fiberwise circle-tilings (the S^1–coordinate) separately. Two robust structural facts are extractable and provable now:
  1) Under (a,γ)-periodicity, each irreducible component’s horizontal support X_i must be a union of residue classes mod a.
  2) If Ω uses at least two distinct horizontal offsets, then Ω cannot be a “column” (in the sense of the definition), i.e. there is no tiling having an irreducible component with finite X_i.
- For the main construction with three components carrying (a,0), (a,α), (a,β) for irrational α,β with β∉Q+αQ, decouple the horizontal and vertical constraints. Horizontally, choose a=3 and X_1≡0 mod 3, X_2≡1 mod 3, X_3≡2 mod 3. Vertically, seek per-component circle partitions at each column. The key obstacle is to realize simultaneously the fiberwise tilings for two incommensurable vertical periods using the same intervals I_j (because the shape Ω is fixed). A viable blueprint is to include in Ω enough intervals located at offsets ≡0 mod 3 so that each of T_1, T_2, T_3 can use a disjoint “pair” of intervals (in the sense of which offsets they actually impact) while remaining confined to their coset; since all offsets are ≡0 mod 3, no leakage across X_i occurs.

Rigorous results we can already record
1) Periodic support structure.
Lemma 1. Let Ω be as in the task, and suppose T_i is (a,γ)-periodic and Ω⊕T_i=X_i×S^1. Then X_i+a=X_i. In particular X_i is a union of residue classes mod a.
Proof. For x∈Z, write for each nonzero Fourier mode ℓ the quantity s_{i,j}(x):=∑_{(k,θ)∈T_i, k=x-n_j} e^{2πiℓθ}. (As usual, for x∉X_i all these sums vanish, since by hypothesis Ω⊕T_i has null intersection with {x}×S^1.) (a,γ)-periodicity gives s_{i,j}(x+a)=e^{2πiℓγ}s_{i,j}(x). Thus if x∉X_i then s_{i,j}(x)=0 for all j, hence also s_{i,j}(x+a)=0 for all j, so x+a∉X_i as well. Hence X_i+a=X_i.

2) No finite component if Ω spans ≥2 horizontal offsets.
Lemma 2 (not-a-column criterion). Let N={n_1,…,n_m}⊂Z be the horizontal offsets of Ω, and suppose min N<n_max:=max N. Then there is no tiling T of Z×S^1 by Ω with an irreducible component Ω⊕T_i=X_i×S^1 for which 0<|X_i|<∞. Hence Ω is not a column.
Proof. Assume Ω⊕T_i=X_i×S^1 with 0<|X_i|<∞. Let M:=max X_i. Any tile t=(h,θ)∈T_i contributes on the horizontal set h+N. To avoid coverage above M, any tile used in covering M must satisfy h+n≤M for all n∈N, hence h≤M−n_max. To cover M, there must be t with h+n=M for some n∈N; by the preceding restriction this forces n=n_max and h=M−n_max. But then t contributes also at h+min N=M−(n_max−min N)<M, whence that smaller column must belong to X_i. Iterating produces the infinite descending chain M−k(n_max−min N)∈X_i for all k≥1, contradicting finiteness of X_i. ∎
Remark. This argument is purely horizontal and does not use interval lengths (only that the S^1-contribution of any translate has positive measure on each impacted column), so it applies to all Ω with at least two distinct offsets.

3) Horizontal design constraint for irreducible components confined to a single residue class.
Let N⊂Z be the set of offsets of Ω and D:=⟨N−N⟩ the subgroup of Z they generate. If T_i satisfies Ω⊕T_i=X_i×S^1 with X_i contained in a union of residue classes mod a, then necessarily X_i is a union of cosets of D in Z/aZ. In particular, if D=3Z and a=3, then the three sets X_1, X_2, X_3 can be taken to be the three residue classes mod 3. (This is the condition that H_i+N⊆X_i; it forces closure of X_i under addition by differences in N.)

A concrete blueprint toward the desired example
- Take a=3 and choose N={0,3}. By Lemma 2, any such Ω is not a column.
- Fix X_1=3Z, X_2=3Z+1, X_3=3Z+2; this is compatible with Lemma 1 and with the closure constraint above because N−N⊂3Z.
- Vertical (fiberwise) tilings for each component reduce to: For each residue class r (hence for each x with x≡r mod 3) we must tile S^1 by translates of the two intervals I_0 and I_3 coming from the two offsets 0 and 3. If T_i is (3,γ_i)-periodic, passing from x to x+3 rotates the fiberwise partition by γ_i, which is harmless since S^1 is rotation-invariant. The core is to pick a single pair (I_0,I_3) that can support three fiberwise partitions: one with γ_1=0, one with γ_2=α, and one with γ_3=β.
- A robust solvable subproblem: For a single prescribed γ and any T∈N, there exists a (finite) set P⊂S^1 and intervals I_0,I_3 with lengths L_0,L_3 satisfying L_0+L_3=1/T such that (I_0+P)∪(I_3+P−γ) tiles S^1 a.e. Proof: partition S^1 into T equal arcs [k/T,(k+1)/T). Let j:=⌈γT⌉ and set ξ:=j/T−γ∈(0,1/T]. Take L_0:=ξ, L_3:=1/T−ξ, I_0:=[0,L_0), I_3:=[0,L_3), and P:={k/T:0≤k<T}. Then in each arc [k/T,(k+1)/T) the unique point of P−γ lies at k/T+ξ, so [k/T,k/T+L_0) from I_0+P and [k/T+ξ,k/T+ξ+L_3) from I_3+P−γ exactly partition that arc.
- Obstruction to simultaneous use of the same (I_0,I_3) for two distinct γ’s: the construction above forces L_0=ξ(γ)=⌈γT⌉/T−γ, hence equality of L_0 for two different γ implies γ-differences rational. Since we want β∉Q+αQ, we cannot impose such equalities naively. This clarifies why the “single-pair” attempt runs into arithmetic incompatibility.
- Viable workaround (design sketch, to be turned into a proof): include two pairs of intervals at the same offsets: Ω carries four intervals I_0^A,I_3^A and I_0^B,I_3^B (all at offsets 0 and 3), with lengths arranged so that T_2 uses only the A-pair (via the one-γ construction with γ=α), T_3 uses only the B-pair (with γ=β), and T_1 (with γ=0) uses both pairs jointly. Crucially, because both offsets are multiples of 3, all contributions of any translate stay within a single residue class mod 3, so there is no cross-interference across components. The only remaining coupling is vertical inside each component; that is handled by choosing for T_1 a (3,0)-periodic pattern P^A,P^B whose fiberwise union (I_0^A+P^A)∪(I_3^A+P^A)∪(I_0^B+P^B)∪(I_3^B+P^B) tiles S^1. Since we can choose the cardinalities |P^A|,|P^B| freely and s_A+t_A and s_B+t_B arbitrarily (subject to positive lengths) and since S^1 admits arbitrary finite interval partitions, this is a flexible constraint. On X_2 (resp. X_3) we then switch off B (resp. A) at the level of the set of translates (i.e. take T_2 supported only on those vertical phases prescribed by the α-scheme for the A-pair, and analogously for T_3 and the B-pair). The shape Ω is fixed; what changes is which translates we actually place in T_2 or T_3. Because the A- and B-pairs contribute only within their own residue class, the three components do not geometrically conflict across X_1,X_2,X_3.

What is proved now vs. what remains
- Proved now: Lemma 1 (periodicity ⇒ X_i+a=X_i) and Lemma 2 (if Ω uses ≥2 offsets then Ω is not a column). These address two structural pieces of the problem and settle the “not a column” requirement for any Ω with at least two distinct horizontal offsets.
- Constructive existence: For a single irrational γ, the segmentation lemma above gives an explicit way to pick (I_0,I_3) and a finite pattern P so that a (3,γ)-periodic fiberwise tiling exists. The arithmetic obstruction to using the same pair for two incommensurable γ’s is identified; the multi-pair workaround is laid out with precise constraints local to each component and with coset-separation preventing cross-interference.

Obstacles
- The remaining technical point is to pin down an explicit finite choice of A- and B-pairs and (3,0)-periodic P^A,P^B for T_1 that yields a clean fiberwise partition while simultaneously ensuring the α- and β-constructions for T_2 and T_3 (which, by the one-γ lemma, are individually straightforward). This is a finite combinatorial placement problem on S^1 with plenty of degrees of freedom; a direct explicit instance should be obtainable with, say, |P^A|=|P^B|=2 or 3.

Next steps (concrete, checkable)
- Choose a=3 and offsets N={0,3}. Fix irrationals α,β with β∉Q+αQ. Pick T_A,T_B (e.g. 2 or 3) and use the one-γ lemma to produce I_0^A,I_3^A and I_0^B,I_3^B (hence their lengths s_A,t_A and s_B,t_B) together with the periodic vertical sets P^α,P^β furnishing the T_2 and T_3 fiberwise tilings.
- On X_1, explicitly pick (3,0)-periodic finite sets P^A,P^B so that the four families (I_0^A+P^A),(I_3^A+P^A),(I_0^B+P^B),(I_3^B+P^B) partition S^1. This is a deterministic finite packing problem that can be solved (e.g. by greedy placement) because the total lengths add to 1 and we control the start points. Write out one explicit placement.
- Verify irreducibility of each T_i: with N={0,3}, every translate used at horizontal coordinate k impacts exactly the two columns k and k+3 in the same X_i. If (by construction) at every k in the residue class we place at least one translate, the bipartite graph (columns versus translates, edges when a translate impacts a column) is connected along the 3-step chain, so any decomposition T_i=T_i^0⊔T_i^1 forcing Ω⊕T_i^j=X_i^j×S^1 has X_i^j either empty or all of X_i (this is the “edge forcing” argument sketched in the analysis).

Summary
- The non-column part is settled now via Lemma 2: any Ω with ≥2 horizontal offsets cannot admit a finite-column irreducible component.
- The periodic-support structure (Lemma 1) justifies working with X_i as unions of residue classes mod a.
- For the existence of the requested decomposition with three incommensurable vertical characters, a concrete scheme with a=3 and offsets N={0,3} is outlined. The one-γ fiberwise tiling lemma gives T_2 and T_3 immediately once we dedicate two disjoint “pairs” of intervals inside Ω to α and β, respectively. The remaining finite placement for T_1 is a flexible packing problem on S^1; producing an explicit placement is the next concretely checkable task. The irreducibility of each T_i follows from the 0/3 adjacency connectivity once at least one translate is present at every horizontal site in the corresponding residue class.
