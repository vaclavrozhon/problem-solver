Ideas and scope
- I first audit the definitions and the problem statement for precision and internal consistency.
- Then I extract structural constraints that any tiling must satisfy (finiteness of fibers, linear balance equations on each Z-level, periodic constraints). These can go into proofs.md as basic lemmas.
- I analyze consequences for a 3-component (a,·)-periodic decomposition, including the necessary residue-class combinatorics on Z/aZ.
- I test small cases (m = 1, 2) to see what is forced or impossible, and isolate the source of difficulties with simultaneous (a,α) and (a,β) periodic components.
- I indicate obstacles and suggest next steps (either toward a construction or an obstruction), with concrete subproblems.

Flaws/gaps/typos in the current writeup
- Clarify the ambient measure and “null sets.” Natural choice: counting measure on Z times Lebesgue measure m on S^1. State this explicitly and that all equalities are understood m-a.e. on the circle at each integer level.
- Definition of (a,α)-periodic: the writeup says “We say that a set A is (a,α)-periodic if T+(a,α)=T.” Replace T by A: A+(a,α)=A.
- In the irreducible decomposition definition, there is likely a typo: “X_i=X_i^0\sqcup X^1_0” should read “X_i=X_i^0\sqcup X_i^1.”
- In the problem statement, “and X = X_1\sqcup X_2\sqcup X_3” appears, but X has not been defined; it should be Z = X_1\sqcup X_2\sqcup X_3.
- Interval conventions on S^1 (open/closed/half-open) should be fixed so that boundaries are m-null, and it should be stated that all intervals have positive length.
- Clarify measurability/cardinality of T: it is implicitly a measurable subset of Z×S^1. In this model, a standard consequence (proved below) is that T is countable and each vertical fiber is finite. Stating this will avoid pathologies.

Basic structural lemmas (valid for any tiling)
Setup: Let Ω = \bigcup_{j=1}^m {n_j}×I_j, with lengths ℓ_j := m(I_j) > 0, and let T ⊂ Z×S^1 be a tiling: Ω ⊕ T = ⨆_{t∈T}(Ω+t) = Z×S^1 up to null sets.

Lemma 1 (Finiteness of fibers; countability of T).
For each u ∈ Z, let T_u := {φ ∈ S^1 : (u,φ) ∈ T}. Then:
- For each N ∈ Z, for each j, only the fibers T_{N-n_j} contribute at level N, via the family of arcs {I_j + φ : φ∈T_{N-n_j}}.
- These arcs are pairwise a.e. disjoint and cover S^1. In particular, the family of arcs at level N is at most countable. Since each arc has length ≥ min_j ℓ_j > 0, it is in fact finite. Consequently T_u is finite for every u, and hence T is countable.
Proof. At fixed N, the tiling restriction to {N}×S^1 is a disjoint union (a.e.) of arcs of lengths in {ℓ_j}. A disjoint partition of S^1 into positive-length arcs is finite. The rest follows by inspection across N.

Lemma 2 (Level-wise balance equations).
For each N∈Z, the number of arcs contributed at level N by I_j is |T_{N-n_j}|, so
∑_{j=1}^m ℓ_j · |T_{N-n_j}| = 1.
More generally, if we define (for any s∈Z) c_{j,s} := ∫_{S^1} 1_{I_j}(x)e^{-2πisx} dx (the s-th Fourier coefficient of 1_{I_j}) and H(N,s) := ∑_{φ∈T_N} e^{-2πisφ}, then for all N∈Z,
∑_{j=1}^m c_{j,s} · H(N-n_j,s) = δ_{s,0}.
Proof. Take Fourier coefficients in x of the equality on {N}×S^1.

Irreducible decomposition and periodic components
Let an irreducible decomposition be T = ⨆_{i∈I} T_i and Z = ⨆_{i∈I} X_i with Ω⊕T_i = X_i×S^1. For a fixed i, write U_i := proj_Z(T_i) ⊂ Z and fibers (T_i)_u ⊂ S^1.

Lemma 3 (Support relation Xi = Ui + {n_j}).
For each i, Xi = Ui + {n_1,…,n_m} as a set (sumset in Z):
- If u ∈ U_i, then for every j, u+n_j ∈ X_i (otherwise Ω ⊕ T_i would spill outside X_i×S^1).
- Conversely, if N∈X_i, then there exists j and u∈U_i with N = u+n_j (else no t∈T_i could contribute at level N and Ω⊕T_i would miss {N}×S^1).
Proof. Direct from Ω⊕T_i = X_i×S^1 and positivity of lengths.

Lemma 4 (Periodicity constraints on fibers).
If T_i is (a,γ)-periodic, then for all u∈Z, (T_i)_{u+a} = (T_i)_u + γ. Consequently, |(T_i)_{u+a}| = |(T_i)_u|. Let V_i ⊂ Z/aZ be the set of residues s with (T_i)_u≠∅ for some/any u≡s (mod a); then V_i is well-defined, and the fibers’ cardinalities and Fourier data depend only on the residue s.
Proof. Immediate from invariance under translation by (a,γ).

Residue-class combinatorics (necessary for any 3-component (a,·)-periodic tiling)
Fix a∈Z\{0}. Let S ⊂ Z/aZ denote the set of residues of the vertical coordinates {n_j} modulo a (counted without multiplicity). For a component i, define V_i ⊂ Z/aZ as in Lemma 4, and R_i := V_i + S ⊂ Z/aZ (sumset mod a).

Claim A (Residue partition). For any irreducible decomposition with each T_i (a,·)-periodic and Ω⊕T_i = X_i×S^1, the residue sets satisfy a disjoint partition
Z/aZ = R_1 ⊔ R_2 ⊔ R_3, where R_i = V_i + S.
Justification. For N∈Z, N mod a belongs to exactly one X_i (since {X_i} partitions Z). By Lemma 3, N∈X_i iff N ≡ u+n_j (mod a) for some u∈U_i, i.e., iff N mod a ∈ V_i + S. Disjointness follows from disjointness of the X_i.

Claim B (Level-wise balance per residue).
For each i and residue r∈R_i, there exist integers t_i(s) = |(T_i)_u| (for s∈Z/aZ, u≡s mod a), such that the balance equation holds for every N≡r (mod a):
∑_{j=1}^m ℓ_j · t_i(r - (n_j mod a)) = 1.
In particular, for fixed i the left-hand side depends only on r, not on the specific N.
Proof. Combine Lemmas 2 and 4 and note that cardinalities depend only on residues.

Remark. If S is a singleton modulo a (i.e., all n_j are congruent mod a), then r−(n_j mod a) is independent of j, so the sum above becomes (∑_j ℓ_j)·t_i(r−constant) = 1. This forces (∑_j ℓ_j) to be the reciprocal of an integer and the same number of copies of every interval to be used on those levels. This special case is structurally rigid and useful for testing impossibility.

Small cases and testable impossibilities
1) m = 1. Then Ω = {n}×I with one interval. For any tiling, each level N uses only u=N−n. One can split T arbitrarily into two nonempty parts and obtain two nontrivial X-sets, so irreducibility cannot hold unless X is finite. Thus any such Ω is a column (in the sense of the current definition). Hence m=1 cannot realize the requested example (this is a clean special-case statement that can go to proofs.md).

2) m = 2 with n_2−n_1 divisible by a.
Write n_1 = a s_1, n_2 = a s_2. For a component i with (a,γ)-periodicity, Lemma 4 implies that at a fixed N, the two contributing fibers are related by a known phase shift: (T_i)_{N−n_2} = (T_i)_{N−n_1} − (s_2−s_1)·γ. Thus the relative phase between the I_1- and I_2-contributions at that level is rigidly γ (up to a fixed integer multiple). Specializing to the simplest case with one copy per interval, any exact partition of S^1 by two arcs of lengths ℓ_1,ℓ_2=1−ℓ_1 forces the relative phase to be either ℓ_1 or ℓ_2 (mod 1). Consequently, the same Ω cannot simultaneously support such partitions for two incommensurable γ=α and γ=β with α∉Q, β∉Q+αQ unless the lengths satisfy two incompatible congruences. This yields an explicit obstruction for m=2 in the “all n_j≡ (mod a)” regime. A full proof can be written down (it is just the two-arc tiling geometry on the circle).

Caveat. If n_2−n_1 is not divisible by a, the two contributing fibers at a level belong to different residue classes, hence their relative phase is not constrained by periodicity. In that case the above obstruction disappears, so m=2 is not ruled out by this argument alone. The residue partition constraint (Claim A) still applies and can be used to test feasibility once a is fixed.

What really needs to be clarified/proved next
- Formalize a clean residue-class model. For fixed a, S ⊂ Z/aZ is the set of vertical residues of Ω. For each i we pick V_i ⊂ Z/aZ and t_i:Z/aZ→N so that (i) R_i=V_i+S partition Z/aZ, and (ii) the linear balance equations (Claim B) hold on each r∈R_i. This is a finite, checkable system.
- Geometric compatibility on S^1. Beyond the cardinality constraints, one must realize, for each i and each residue r∈R_i, a disjoint exact partition of S^1 by the family of arcs
{I_j + φ : j=1,…,m, φ∈(T_i)_{N−n_j}}, with (T_i)_{u+a}=(T_i)_u + γ_i. This reduces to the following structured task: fix a residue class s, choose a finite set Φ_s ⊂ S^1 (the base fiber phases for that residue); then for every N≡r, the contributing phases are the α-shifts of those Φ_s consistent with (n_j mod a). In the special case S={0} these phases are all the same residue and the relative offsets between different j are rigid multiples of γ_i (useful for contradiction); in the general case (|S|>1), the different j engage different residues and hence different Φ_s, giving more freedom but subject to the residue-partition combinatorics.

Constructive vs. obstructive directions
- Constructive attempt. Take a≥3 and let S have at least two residues modulo a (so that m≥2 and the j’s at a fixed level use different residues). Pick a partition Z/aZ = R_1⊔R_2⊔R_3 and choose V_i such that R_i=V_i+S. Then try to solve the finite system ∑_j ℓ_j t_i(r−n_j)=1 on r∈R_i by picking the ℓ_j and t_i (integers) — a small integer linear programming problem. If solvable, choose for each residue s a finite set Φ_{i,s} of phases arranged so that for each r∈R_i, the disjoint union over j of I_j + Φ_{i,r−n_j} tiles S^1, and enforce periodicity Φ_{i,s}↦Φ_{i,s}+γ_i under s↦s+a. With α,β irrational and rationally independent, one must ensure that the same family (I_j) supports both γ_i=α and γ_i=β. The decoupling across residues (|S|>1) makes this plausible to attempt numerically/combinatorially.
- Obstructive approach. In the rigid regime S={aℤ}-coset (all n_j≡ mod a), the per-level pattern for a periodic component is a translate of a fixed multiset of arcs with relative offsets an arithmetic progression in γ. Showing that a single Ω cannot simultaneously realize γ=α and γ=β in this regime looks approachable via circle geometry or first nonzero Fourier modes. One can encode the per-level tiling constraint for s=±1 in Fourier space: ∑_j c_{j,1} H_i(N−n_j,1)=0. Using (T_i)_{u+a}=(T_i)_u+γ gives H_i(u+a,1)=e^{2πiγ}H_i(u,1). If all n_j≡ mod a, then at a fixed level all H_i(N−n_j,1) equal the same complex number times e^{2πi(s_j)γ}, yielding a single nontrivial exponential polynomial in e^{2πiγ}. Satisfying this both at γ=α and γ=β with α,β rationally independent forces stringent constraints on the c_{j,1} (hence the ℓ_j) that can likely only hold in degenerate/column cases. This line can be developed into a formal obstruction lemma for the S={single residue} case.

Special cases proved/ready-to-formalize
- Lemma 1–4 and Claims A–B above are simple and rigorous; they give a clean finite reduction modulo a and level-wise balance conditions.
- m=1 case: Ω is a column, hence cannot be an example.
- m=2 with all n_j≡ mod a: two-arc geometric obstruction for having two incommensurable γ’s (details can be written now).

Obstacles identified
- Irreducibility is subtle: even if Z/aZ and cardinalities are arranged, one must ensure that no nontrivial partition T_i=T_i^0⊔T_i^1 inherited from the chosen fibers continues to tile product-rectangles. Because each point (u,φ) contributes to multiple adjacent levels (N=u+n_j), the phase design must strongly “entangle” contributions across different N to block such decompositions. The residue graph viewpoint (bipartite graph between U_i and X_i with edges u↔u+n_j) is useful; showing that any admissible T_i induces a connected entanglement w.r.t. this graph is a promising criterion for irreducibility.
- Simultaneously accommodating γ=α and γ=β with a common family (I_j) is the core difficulty. When S is a single residue, we have a strong Fourier/geometry obstruction. When |S|>1, different residues decouple and the degrees of freedom may suffice, but one must navigate the residue-partition constraints R_i=V_i+S.

Concrete next steps (auditable)
1) Formalize and add to proofs.md: Lemmas 1–4 and Claims A–B with complete proofs. These establish the finite reduction modulo a and the key balance identities.
2) Write and prove the two-interval impossibility for the case n_2−n_1≡0 (mod a): a single Ω with two intervals cannot support both (a,α)- and (a,β)-periodic components with α,β irrational and β∉Q+αQ.
3) Explore the finite group model Z/aZ computationally for small a and small |S|≥2: find V_i and residue partitions satisfying R_i=V_i+S and the integer balance system ∑_j ℓ_j t_i(r−n_j)=1, starting with symmetric choices (e.g., a=3,4,5; m=3 or 4; |S|=2). Even one explicit feasible instance (ignoring irreducibility) would narrow the search.
4) Develop a Fourier-mode obstruction in the “rigid” case S={single residue}. Show that if one component is (a,α)-periodic and another is (a,β)-periodic with α,β irrational, then Ω must be a column (or derive a contradiction) whenever all n_j are congruent mod a.
5) Irreducibility criterion: formulate a sufficient “graph connectivity + full-use” condition ensuring that a periodic T_i cannot be split into two tiling components. Then test it on any candidate construction from step 3.

Summary
- The current writeup needs several small but important corrections (periodicity definition, typos, measure specification) and clearer statements about measurability and finiteness of fibers.
- I provided general lemmas: fibers are finite; level-wise (Fourier) balance equations; the relation Xi = Ui + {n_j}; periodicity constraints on fibers; and the residue-class partition Z/aZ = ⊔_i (V_i + S) plus per-residue linear balance. These reduce the problem to a finite combinatorial system modulo a, plus a geometric realization problem on S^1 subject to (a,γ)-periodicity.
- A concrete impossibility holds for m=1 (column) and for m=2 in the rigid case n_2−n_1≡0 (mod a): the same Ω cannot support both (a,α)- and (a,β)-periodic components when α,β are irrational and independent over Q. This is a usable special case.
- For |S|≥2, a construction might be possible (degrees of freedom increase), but must satisfy the residue-partition constraints and an irreducibility criterion. I outlined a precise finite framework to search for such examples or prove they cannot exist.
