=== SYSTEM ===
You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md, proofs.md, and output.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers
- notes.md (informal progress & exploratory work so far)
- proofs.md (rigorous proofs & detailed mathematics so far)
- output.md (main results found so far)

**Three-tier file system guidelines**:
- **notes.md**: Readable, log of exploratory work, intuitions, failed attempts, ideas. Prefer appending. Replace only if old notes are clearly misleading. It should be self-contained: In particular, reading it should make sense without knowing the output of provers in past rounds. 

- **proofs.md**: Complete rigorous mathematical proofs with full details. Think twice before adding anything. Contains proven lemmas, theorems, and detailed derivations. Only add mathematically verified content here.
- **output.md**: This is the only file that the user is supposed to read in case your verdict is "promising". It has to be self-contained. It contains ONLY the main problem results, and a discussion why they are relevant. It is extremely selective. Think twice before promoting proofs from proofs.md to output.md. Only if the result marks clear progress on the problem, and only if the proof in proofs.md has been thoroughly vetted by provers and you, it can join output.md. Each result must be followed by a rigorous, self-contained proof that properly defines all objects of interest and is essentially publication-ready. 

Tasks:
1) Audit rigor: identify unjustified steps, false statements, missing lemmas; produce minimal counterexamples.
2) Triage value: separate genuine progress from noise.
3) Guide next steps: propose what provers should try next.

\newcommand{\Z}{\mathbb{Z}}
\newcommand{\Sone}{\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}}
\newcommand{\1}{\mathbf{1}}

We are in the setup $\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{S}^1$ (where we view $\mathbb{S}^1=\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$), and we consider subset $\Omega\subseteq \mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{S}^1$ of the form
$$\Omega=\bigcup_{i=1}^m \{n_i\}\times I_i,$$
where $m\in \mathbb{N}$, $n_i\in \mathbb{Z}$ and $I_i\subseteq \mathbb{S}^1$ is an interval for every $1\le i\le m$.
Note that we allow have $n_i=n_j$ for $i\not= j$.

We say that $\Omega$ is a tile if there is $T\subseteq \mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{S}^1$ such that
$$\Omega\oplus T=\bigsqcup_{t\in T} (\Omega+t)=\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{S}^1,$$
where the disjoin union is understand up to null sets.
In that case, we also say that $T$ is a tiling of $\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{S}^1$ by $\Omega$.

Let $T$ be a tiling.
An \emph{irreducible decomposition of $T$} is $T=\bigsqcup_{i\in I} T_i$ and $\mathbb{Z}=\bigsqcup_{i\in I} X_i$ such that
\begin{itemize}
    \item $T_i\not=\emptyset$ for every $i\in I$,
    \item $\Omega\oplus T_i=X_i\times \mathbb{S}^1$,
    \item if we write $T_i=T^0_i\sqcup T^1_i$ and $X_i=X_i^0\sqcup X^1_0$ such that $\Omega\oplus T^j_i=X^j_i\times\mathbb{S}^1$ for $j\in \{0,1\}$, then either $X^0_i=\emptyset$ or  $X^1_i=\emptyset$.
\end{itemize}

We say that a tile $\Omega$ is a \emph{column} if there is a tiling $T$ that has an irreducible decomposition $\{T_i\}_{i\in I}$ and $\{X_i\}_{i\in I}$ such that  $|X_i|<\infty$ for some $i\in I$.

We say that a set $A\subseteq \mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{S}^1$ is \emph{$(a,\alpha)$-periodic} if $T+(a,\alpha)=T$.


\begin{problem}
    Is there a tile $\Omega$ that is not a column and that admits a tiling $T$ such that the irreducible decomposition of $T$ has the form $T=T_1\sqcup T_2\sqcup T_3$ and $X=X_1\sqcup X_2\sqcup X_3$ such that there are $a\in \mathbb{Z}\setminus \{0\}$, $\alpha,\beta>0$ irrational such that $\beta\not\in \mathbb{Q}+\alpha\mathbb{Q}$ such that $T_1$ is $(a,0)$-periodic, $T_2$ is $(a,\alpha)$-periodic and $T_3$ is $(a,\beta)$-periodic?
\end{problem}

Ideas
- Work with two “vertical bars” at heights 0 and a, i.e. S = {0,a}, because then every translate (n,θ) of Ω affects only two columns n and n+a. This allows a clean decomposition of columns by residue classes mod a.
- Ensure Ω is not a column by forcing every component X in any irreducible decomposition to be infinite. A robust mechanism is: if the lengths of the two intervals are Q-linearly independent, then in any fiber one must use exactly one copy of each interval (disjointly) to reach measure 1. Because each (n,θ) contributes to two columns (n and n+a), this forces closure under ±a and hence infinitude of X.
- Try to realize 3 components with period a (take a=3), having (3,0)-, (3,α)-, (3,β)-periodicity, with α,β irrational and β∉Q+αQ. Construct T as a union of three orbits modulo 3.

A precise necessary lemma
Lemma (no finite irreducible components for S={0,a} if lengths are Q-independent). Let Ω = ({0}×I) ∪ ({a}×J) where |I|=ℓ, |J|=1−ℓ and assume 1,ℓ are Q-linearly independent (equivalently, ℓ is irrational). Suppose Ω⊕T=Z×S^1 and T=⨆_i T_i is an irreducible decomposition with Ω⊕T_i=X_i×S^1. Then each nonempty X_i is infinite (indeed X_i+a=X_i, hence |X_i|=∞).
Proof. Fix i and y∈X_i. Let m_I(y) be the number of arcs of type I used at column y by Ω⊕T_i, and similarly m_J(y). Since the union is disjoint (a.e.) and covers S^1, m_I(y)ℓ + m_J(y)(1−ℓ) = 1. As 1,ℓ are Q-linearly independent, the only nonnegative integer solution is m_I(y)=m_J(y)=1. Thus at y there is exactly one (n,θ)∈T_i with n=y (contributing I) and exactly one with n=y−a (contributing J). In particular, T_i uses some translate at n=y, which also contributes a J-arc to column y+a; hence y+a∈X_i. Similarly, y−a∈X_i. Thus X_i is a union of cosets of aZ and is infinite. Irreducibility then forces each X_i to be a union of entire residue classes mod a. ∎

Consequence: Ω with two bars and |I| irrational is not a column. Indeed, in any irreducible decomposition all nonempty X_i are infinite.

Target construction outline (a=3)
- Take S={0,3}. We want T=T_1⨆T_2⨆T_3 and Z= X_1⨆X_2⨆X_3 with X_r={n∈Z: n≡r mod 3}.
- Periodicities desired: T_1 is (3,0)-periodic; T_2 is (3,α)-periodic; T_3 is (3,β)-periodic, with α,β irrational and β∉Q+αQ.
- We need Ω to allow, at each y∈X_r, a disjoint union (a.e.) of arcs of total length 1 coming from the two bars at positions y and y−3. By the lemma, with |I| irrational, per column we must use exactly one I-arc (from n=y) and one J-arc (from n=y−3). The second coordinates (angles) used at y and y−3 may differ; disjointness and full coverage force a geometric constraint on the relative angle difference.

Geometric compatibility constraint
Let I,J⊂S^1 be intervals of lengths ℓ and 1−ℓ. Fix a difference δ∈S^1. Consider the two sets I and J−δ. Their union equals S^1 (disjoint a.e.) if and only if they are complementary up to endpoints. Equivalently, the right end of one matches the left end of the other, and vice versa. This pins down δ uniquely by the endpoints of I,J. In particular:
- For a given choice of I,J, there is a unique δ∈S^1 such that I ⊔ (J−δ) = S^1 (disjoint a.e.). Call this δ=δ(I,J).
- Therefore, at a column y, if the I-arc comes from angle θ_y (at n=y) and the J-arc from angle φ_{y−3} (at n=y−3), disjoint full coverage demands θ_y − φ_{y−3} ≡ δ(I,J) mod 1.

Reconciling with periodicities
For T_1 to be (3,0)-periodic, taking θ_y constant along the class X_0, we must have φ_{y−3}=θ_y, hence δ(I,J)≡0. Thus I and J must be complements (no relative rotation) for the class X_0 component.
For T_2 to be (3,α)-periodic, along X_1 we have θ_{y+3}=θ_y+α. The coverage condition requires θ_y−φ_{y−3}≡δ(I,J). But also φ_{y}−φ_{y−3} should equal α if φ comes from the same (3,α)-orbit. Plugging in over consecutive columns forces δ(I,J)≡α. A similar analysis for T_3 imposes δ(I,J)≡β along X_2.
This reveals a conflict if we use the same pair I,J to serve all three components: we would need δ(I,J) to equal 0, α, and β simultaneously. This cannot happen unless α≡β≡0. Hence a single pair S={0,3} cannot simultaneously realize (3,0)-, (3,α)-, and (3,β)-components when the same two bars contribute in all classes.

Why the naïve multi-pair fix fails
One might try to add more bars and “assign” disjoint pairs of bars to each component. However, any translate (n,θ) applies to all bars present in Ω, not just a chosen pair. Thus contributions from “unassigned” bars would appear and cannot be suppressed, breaking disjointness. Therefore, a construction must ensure that, for each component, the bars that actually contribute at its columns are the only bars present in Ω that can contribute there.

Concrete progress: a necessary condition and a no-go for a single pair
Proposition (no-go for one pair). Let Ω=({0}×I)∪({3}×J) with |I| irrational. If Ω admits a tiling T whose irreducible decomposition T=T_1⨆T_2⨆T_3 over X_r={n≡r mod 3} and T_r are respectively (3,0)-, (3,α)-, (3,β)-periodic with α,β irrational, then necessarily δ(I,J) must equal 0, α, and β simultaneously, a contradiction unless α≡β≡0.
Sketch. By the lemma, at each y in a component the coverage uses exactly one I- and one J-arc. The (3,γ)-periodicity on that component forces the angle difference between y and y−3 to be γ, while disjoint full coverage demands that angle difference equal δ(I,J). Apply with γ=0,α,β on X_0,X_1,X_2. ∎

Consequences
- With two bars, the desired triple of periodicities cannot occur. This is a genuine obstruction extracted from the geometry of two-interval partitions of the circle and the independence of |I|.
- The lemma remains a useful structural tool: it shows Ω with two bars and irrational length is not a column, independently of periodicity ambitions.

Next steps
1) Try m≥3 bars. The two-interval obstruction disappears because a fiber can be filled by 3 or more arcs; the relative angle constraints become a system which may allow two distinct irrational steps α,β. The goal is to design I_1,…,I_m and n_j so that, on each residue class X_r, (i) only a prescribed subset of bars can contribute; (ii) the number of arcs used and their relative angles are compatible with the orbit relation θ_{y+3}=θ_y+γ_r. This suggests using separated supports S_r⊂{n_j} that are “residue-class selective,” e.g., S_0={0,3}, S_1={1,4}, S_2={2,5}, but without adding extra bars elsewhere (see the obstruction above). A promising scheme is to take n_j spaced by 3 and to require that at each residue class only those bars can reach its columns (this demands the set of bar heights to be congruent to that residue class only).
2) Formalize a general “local-to-global” linear system: for each residue class r and each y∈X_r, the counts vector m(y)∈N^m must satisfy ∑_j m_j(y)|I_j|=1. Add the (3,γ_r)-orbit constraints on angles to force disjointness. Solve for a simple pattern (e.g., constant m(y)=m_r independent of y) yielding a tractable set of equations.
3) Maintain the non-column property: arrange the irrationality so that any irreducible component is infinite (use the lemma’s mechanism generalized to m≥3 via Q-linear independence of a suitable subfamily of lengths).

Summary of proven pieces
- For Ω with two bars {0,3} and |I| irrational, Ω is not a column (Lemma).
- With two bars, the requested 3-component periodic tiling with periods (3,0),(3,α),(3,β) (α,β irrational, β∉Q+αQ) is impossible (Proposition), because the unique angle difference δ(I,J) forced by disjointness would have to equal 0,α,β simultaneously.
- The path forward is to move to ≥3 bars and engineer which bars can reach which residue classes, then solve the disjointness-and-periodicity constraints; the lemma gives a way to keep Ω non-column via irrational length constraints.

Obstacles explicitly identified
- Any (n,θ) translates all bars of Ω, so “assigning bars” to components is nontrivial; the geometry must ensure only the intended bars can reach the intended columns.
- With two bars, the disjointness constraint rigidifies the relative angle difference to a single constant δ(I,J), blocking three distinct periodicities.

Ideas
- Work at the level of horizontal combinatorics (the Z–coordinate) and fiberwise circle-tilings (the S^1–coordinate) separately. Two robust structural facts are extractable and provable now:
  1) Under (a,γ)-periodicity, each irreducible component’s horizontal support X_i must be a union of residue classes mod a.
  2) If Ω uses at least two distinct horizontal offsets, then Ω cannot be a “column” (in the sense of the definition), i.e. there is no tiling having an irreducible component with finite X_i.
- For the main construction with three components carrying (a,0), (a,α), (a,β) for irrational α,β with β∉Q+αQ, decouple the horizontal and vertical constraints. Horizontally, choose a=3 and X_1≡0 mod 3, X_2≡1 mod 3, X_3≡2 mod 3. Vertically, seek per-component circle partitions at each column. The key obstacle is to realize simultaneously the fiberwise tilings for two incommensurable vertical periods using the same intervals I_j (because the shape Ω is fixed). A viable blueprint is to include in Ω enough intervals located at offsets ≡0 mod 3 so that each of T_1, T_2, T_3 can use a disjoint “pair” of intervals (in the sense of which offsets they actually impact) while remaining confined to their coset; since all offsets are ≡0 mod 3, no leakage across X_i occurs.

Rigorous results we can already record
1) Periodic support structure.
Lemma 1. Let Ω be as in the task, and suppose T_i is (a,γ)-periodic and Ω⊕T_i=X_i×S^1. Then X_i+a=X_i. In particular X_i is a union of residue classes mod a.
Proof. For x∈Z, write for each nonzero Fourier mode ℓ the quantity s_{i,j}(x):=∑_{(k,θ)∈T_i, k=x-n_j} e^{2πiℓθ}. (As usual, for x∉X_i all these sums vanish, since by hypothesis Ω⊕T_i has null intersection with {x}×S^1.) (a,γ)-periodicity gives s_{i,j}(x+a)=e^{2πiℓγ}s_{i,j}(x). Thus if x∉X_i then s_{i,j}(x)=0 for all j, hence also s_{i,j}(x+a)=0 for all j, so x+a∉X_i as well. Hence X_i+a=X_i.

2) No finite component if Ω spans ≥2 horizontal offsets.
Lemma 2 (not-a-column criterion). Let N={n_1,…,n_m}⊂Z be the horizontal offsets of Ω, and suppose min N<n_max:=max N. Then there is no tiling T of Z×S^1 by Ω with an irreducible component Ω⊕T_i=X_i×S^1 for which 0<|X_i|<∞. Hence Ω is not a column.
Proof. Assume Ω⊕T_i=X_i×S^1 with 0<|X_i|<∞. Let M:=max X_i. Any tile t=(h,θ)∈T_i contributes on the horizontal set h+N. To avoid coverage above M, any tile used in covering M must satisfy h+n≤M for all n∈N, hence h≤M−n_max. To cover M, there must be t with h+n=M for some n∈N; by the preceding restriction this forces n=n_max and h=M−n_max. But then t contributes also at h+min N=M−(n_max−min N)<M, whence that smaller column must belong to X_i. Iterating produces the infinite descending chain M−k(n_max−min N)∈X_i for all k≥1, contradicting finiteness of X_i. ∎
Remark. This argument is purely horizontal and does not use interval lengths (only that the S^1-contribution of any translate has positive measure on each impacted column), so it applies to all Ω with at least two distinct offsets.

3) Horizontal design constraint for irreducible components confined to a single residue class.
Let N⊂Z be the set of offsets of Ω and D:=⟨N−N⟩ the subgroup of Z they generate. If T_i satisfies Ω⊕T_i=X_i×S^1 with X_i contained in a union of residue classes mod a, then necessarily X_i is a union of cosets of D in Z/aZ. In particular, if D=3Z and a=3, then the three sets X_1, X_2, X_3 can be taken to be the three residue classes mod 3. (This is the condition that H_i+N⊆X_i; it forces closure of X_i under addition by differences in N.)

A concrete blueprint toward the desired example
- Take a=3 and choose N={0,3}. By Lemma 2, any such Ω is not a column.
- Fix X_1=3Z, X_2=3Z+1, X_3=3Z+2; this is compatible with Lemma 1 and with the closure constraint above because N−N⊂3Z.
- Vertical (fiberwise) tilings for each component reduce to: For each residue class r (hence for each x with x≡r mod 3) we must tile S^1 by translates of the two intervals I_0 and I_3 coming from the two offsets 0 and 3. If T_i is (3,γ_i)-periodic, passing from x to x+3 rotates the fiberwise partition by γ_i, which is harmless since S^1 is rotation-invariant. The core is to pick a single pair (I_0,I_3) that can support three fiberwise partitions: one with γ_1=0, one with γ_2=α, and one with γ_3=β.
- A robust solvable subproblem: For a single prescribed γ and any T∈N, there exists a (finite) set P⊂S^1 and intervals I_0,I_3 with lengths L_0,L_3 satisfying L_0+L_3=1/T such that (I_0+P)∪(I_3+P−γ) tiles S^1 a.e. Proof: partition S^1 into T equal arcs [k/T,(k+1)/T). Let j:=⌈γT⌉ and set ξ:=j/T−γ∈(0,1/T]. Take L_0:=ξ, L_3:=1/T−ξ, I_0:=[0,L_0), I_3:=[0,L_3), and P:={k/T:0≤k<T}. Then in each arc [k/T,(k+1)/T) the unique point of P−γ lies at k/T+ξ, so [k/T,k/T+L_0) from I_0+P and [k/T+ξ,k/T+ξ+L_3) from I_3+P−γ exactly partition that arc.
- Obstruction to simultaneous use of the same (I_0,I_3) for two distinct γ’s: the construction above forces L_0=ξ(γ)=⌈γT⌉/T−γ, hence equality of L_0 for two different γ implies γ-differences rational. Since we want β∉Q+αQ, we cannot impose such equalities naively. This clarifies why the “single-pair” attempt runs into arithmetic incompatibility.
- Viable workaround (design sketch, to be turned into a proof): include two pairs of intervals at the same offsets: Ω carries four intervals I_0^A,I_3^A and I_0^B,I_3^B (all at offsets 0 and 3), with lengths arranged so that T_2 uses only the A-pair (via the one-γ construction with γ=α), T_3 uses only the B-pair (with γ=β), and T_1 (with γ=0) uses both pairs jointly. Crucially, because both offsets are multiples of 3, all contributions of any translate stay within a single residue class mod 3, so there is no cross-interference across components. The only remaining coupling is vertical inside each component; that is handled by choosing for T_1 a (3,0)-periodic pattern P^A,P^B whose fiberwise union (I_0^A+P^A)∪(I_3^A+P^A)∪(I_0^B+P^B)∪(I_3^B+P^B) tiles S^1. Since we can choose the cardinalities |P^A|,|P^B| freely and s_A+t_A and s_B+t_B arbitrarily (subject to positive lengths) and since S^1 admits arbitrary finite interval partitions, this is a flexible constraint. On X_2 (resp. X_3) we then switch off B (resp. A) at the level of the set of translates (i.e. take T_2 supported only on those vertical phases prescribed by the α-scheme for the A-pair, and analogously for T_3 and the B-pair). The shape Ω is fixed; what changes is which translates we actually place in T_2 or T_3. Because the A- and B-pairs contribute only within their own residue class, the three components do not geometrically conflict across X_1,X_2,X_3.

What is proved now vs. what remains
- Proved now: Lemma 1 (periodicity ⇒ X_i+a=X_i) and Lemma 2 (if Ω uses ≥2 offsets then Ω is not a column). These address two structural pieces of the problem and settle the “not a column” requirement for any Ω with at least two distinct horizontal offsets.
- Constructive existence: For a single irrational γ, the segmentation lemma above gives an explicit way to pick (I_0,I_3) and a finite pattern P so that a (3,γ)-periodic fiberwise tiling exists. The arithmetic obstruction to using the same pair for two incommensurable γ’s is identified; the multi-pair workaround is laid out with precise constraints local to each component and with coset-separation preventing cross-interference.

Obstacles
- The remaining technical point is to pin down an explicit finite choice of A- and B-pairs and (3,0)-periodic P^A,P^B for T_1 that yields a clean fiberwise partition while simultaneously ensuring the α- and β-constructions for T_2 and T_3 (which, by the one-γ lemma, are individually straightforward). This is a finite combinatorial placement problem on S^1 with plenty of degrees of freedom; a direct explicit instance should be obtainable with, say, |P^A|=|P^B|=2 or 3.

Next steps (concrete, checkable)
- Choose a=3 and offsets N={0,3}. Fix irrationals α,β with β∉Q+αQ. Pick T_A,T_B (e.g. 2 or 3) and use the one-γ lemma to produce I_0^A,I_3^A and I_0^B,I_3^B (hence their lengths s_A,t_A and s_B,t_B) together with the periodic vertical sets P^α,P^β furnishing the T_2 and T_3 fiberwise tilings.
- On X_1, explicitly pick (3,0)-periodic finite sets P^A,P^B so that the four families (I_0^A+P^A),(I_3^A+P^A),(I_0^B+P^B),(I_3^B+P^B) partition S^1. This is a deterministic finite packing problem that can be solved (e.g. by greedy placement) because the total lengths add to 1 and we control the start points. Write out one explicit placement.
- Verify irreducibility of each T_i: with N={0,3}, every translate used at horizontal coordinate k impacts exactly the two columns k and k+3 in the same X_i. If (by construction) at every k in the residue class we place at least one translate, the bipartite graph (columns versus translates, edges when a translate impacts a column) is connected along the 3-step chain, so any decomposition T_i=T_i^0⊔T_i^1 forcing Ω⊕T_i^j=X_i^j×S^1 has X_i^j either empty or all of X_i (this is the “edge forcing” argument sketched in the analysis).

Summary
- The non-column part is settled now via Lemma 2: any Ω with ≥2 horizontal offsets cannot admit a finite-column irreducible component.
- The periodic-support structure (Lemma 1) justifies working with X_i as unions of residue classes mod a.
- For the existence of the requested decomposition with three incommensurable vertical characters, a concrete scheme with a=3 and offsets N={0,3} is outlined. The one-γ fiberwise tiling lemma gives T_2 and T_3 immediately once we dedicate two disjoint “pairs” of intervals inside Ω to α and β, respectively. The remaining finite placement for T_1 is a flexible packing problem on S^1; producing an explicit placement is the next concretely checkable task. The irreducibility of each T_i follows from the 0/3 adjacency connectivity once at least one translate is present at every horizontal site in the corresponding residue class.

Ideas and scope
- I first audit the definitions and the problem statement for precision and internal consistency.
- Then I extract structural constraints that any tiling must satisfy (finiteness of fibers, linear balance equations on each Z-level, periodic constraints). These can go into proofs.md as basic lemmas.
- I analyze consequences for a 3-component (a,·)-periodic decomposition, including the necessary residue-class combinatorics on Z/aZ.
- I test small cases (m = 1, 2) to see what is forced or impossible, and isolate the source of difficulties with simultaneous (a,α) and (a,β) periodic components.
- I indicate obstacles and suggest next steps (either toward a construction or an obstruction), with concrete subproblems.

Flaws/gaps/typos in the current writeup
- Clarify the ambient measure and “null sets.” Natural choice: counting measure on Z times Lebesgue measure m on S^1. State this explicitly and that all equalities are understood m-a.e. on the circle at each integer level.
- Definition of (a,α)-periodic: the writeup says “We say that a set A is (a,α)-periodic if T+(a,α)=T.” Replace T by A: A+(a,α)=A.
- In the irreducible decomposition definition, there is likely a typo: “X_i=X_i^0\sqcup X^1_0” should read “X_i=X_i^0\sqcup X_i^1.”
- In the problem statement, “and X = X_1\sqcup X_2\sqcup X_3” appears, but X has not been defined; it should be Z = X_1\sqcup X_2\sqcup X_3.
- Interval conventions on S^1 (open/closed/half-open) should be fixed so that boundaries are m-null, and it should be stated that all intervals have positive length.
- Clarify measurability/cardinality of T: it is implicitly a measurable subset of Z×S^1. In this model, a standard consequence (proved below) is that T is countable and each vertical fiber is finite. Stating this will avoid pathologies.

Basic structural lemmas (valid for any tiling)
Setup: Let Ω = \bigcup_{j=1}^m {n_j}×I_j, with lengths ℓ_j := m(I_j) > 0, and let T ⊂ Z×S^1 be a tiling: Ω ⊕ T = ⨆_{t∈T}(Ω+t) = Z×S^1 up to null sets.

Lemma 1 (Finiteness of fibers; countability of T).
For each u ∈ Z, let T_u := {φ ∈ S^1 : (u,φ) ∈ T}. Then:
- For each N ∈ Z, for each j, only the fibers T_{N-n_j} contribute at level N, via the family of arcs {I_j + φ : φ∈T_{N-n_j}}.
- These arcs are pairwise a.e. disjoint and cover S^1. In particular, the family of arcs at level N is at most countable. Since each arc has length ≥ min_j ℓ_j > 0, it is in fact finite. Consequently T_u is finite for every u, and hence T is countable.
Proof. At fixed N, the tiling restriction to {N}×S^1 is a disjoint union (a.e.) of arcs of lengths in {ℓ_j}. A disjoint partition of S^1 into positive-length arcs is finite. The rest follows by inspection across N.

Lemma 2 (Level-wise balance equations).
For each N∈Z, the number of arcs contributed at level N by I_j is |T_{N-n_j}|, so
∑_{j=1}^m ℓ_j · |T_{N-n_j}| = 1.
More generally, if we define (for any s∈Z) c_{j,s} := ∫_{S^1} 1_{I_j}(x)e^{-2πisx} dx (the s-th Fourier coefficient of 1_{I_j}) and H(N,s) := ∑_{φ∈T_N} e^{-2πisφ}, then for all N∈Z,
∑_{j=1}^m c_{j,s} · H(N-n_j,s) = δ_{s,0}.
Proof. Take Fourier coefficients in x of the equality on {N}×S^1.

Irreducible decomposition and periodic components
Let an irreducible decomposition be T = ⨆_{i∈I} T_i and Z = ⨆_{i∈I} X_i with Ω⊕T_i = X_i×S^1. For a fixed i, write U_i := proj_Z(T_i) ⊂ Z and fibers (T_i)_u ⊂ S^1.

Lemma 3 (Support relation Xi = Ui + {n_j}).
For each i, Xi = Ui + {n_1,…,n_m} as a set (sumset in Z):
- If u ∈ U_i, then for every j, u+n_j ∈ X_i (otherwise Ω ⊕ T_i would spill outside X_i×S^1).
- Conversely, if N∈X_i, then there exists j and u∈U_i with N = u+n_j (else no t∈T_i could contribute at level N and Ω⊕T_i would miss {N}×S^1).
Proof. Direct from Ω⊕T_i = X_i×S^1 and positivity of lengths.

Lemma 4 (Periodicity constraints on fibers).
If T_i is (a,γ)-periodic, then for all u∈Z, (T_i)_{u+a} = (T_i)_u + γ. Consequently, |(T_i)_{u+a}| = |(T_i)_u|. Let V_i ⊂ Z/aZ be the set of residues s with (T_i)_u≠∅ for some/any u≡s (mod a); then V_i is well-defined, and the fibers’ cardinalities and Fourier data depend only on the residue s.
Proof. Immediate from invariance under translation by (a,γ).

Residue-class combinatorics (necessary for any 3-component (a,·)-periodic tiling)
Fix a∈Z\{0}. Let S ⊂ Z/aZ denote the set of residues of the vertical coordinates {n_j} modulo a (counted without multiplicity). For a component i, define V_i ⊂ Z/aZ as in Lemma 4, and R_i := V_i + S ⊂ Z/aZ (sumset mod a).

Claim A (Residue partition). For any irreducible decomposition with each T_i (a,·)-periodic and Ω⊕T_i = X_i×S^1, the residue sets satisfy a disjoint partition
Z/aZ = R_1 ⊔ R_2 ⊔ R_3, where R_i = V_i + S.
Justification. For N∈Z, N mod a belongs to exactly one X_i (since {X_i} partitions Z). By Lemma 3, N∈X_i iff N ≡ u+n_j (mod a) for some u∈U_i, i.e., iff N mod a ∈ V_i + S. Disjointness follows from disjointness of the X_i.

Claim B (Level-wise balance per residue).
For each i and residue r∈R_i, there exist integers t_i(s) = |(T_i)_u| (for s∈Z/aZ, u≡s mod a), such that the balance equation holds for every N≡r (mod a):
∑_{j=1}^m ℓ_j · t_i(r - (n_j mod a)) = 1.
In particular, for fixed i the left-hand side depends only on r, not on the specific N.
Proof. Combine Lemmas 2 and 4 and note that cardinalities depend only on residues.

Remark. If S is a singleton modulo a (i.e., all n_j are congruent mod a), then r−(n_j mod a) is independent of j, so the sum above becomes (∑_j ℓ_j)·t_i(r−constant) = 1. This forces (∑_j ℓ_j) to be the reciprocal of an integer and the same number of copies of every interval to be used on those levels. This special case is structurally rigid and useful for testing impossibility.

Small cases and testable impossibilities
1) m = 1. Then Ω = {n}×I with one interval. For any tiling, each level N uses only u=N−n. One can split T arbitrarily into two nonempty parts and obtain two nontrivial X-sets, so irreducibility cannot hold unless X is finite. Thus any such Ω is a column (in the sense of the current definition). Hence m=1 cannot realize the requested example (this is a clean special-case statement that can go to proofs.md).

2) m = 2 with n_2−n_1 divisible by a.
Write n_1 = a s_1, n_2 = a s_2. For a component i with (a,γ)-periodicity, Lemma 4 implies that at a fixed N, the two contributing fibers are related by a known phase shift: (T_i)_{N−n_2} = (T_i)_{N−n_1} − (s_2−s_1)·γ. Thus the relative phase between the I_1- and I_2-contributions at that level is rigidly γ (up to a fixed integer multiple). Specializing to the simplest case with one copy per interval, any exact partition of S^1 by two arcs of lengths ℓ_1,ℓ_2=1−ℓ_1 forces the relative phase to be either ℓ_1 or ℓ_2 (mod 1). Consequently, the same Ω cannot simultaneously support such partitions for two incommensurable γ=α and γ=β with α∉Q, β∉Q+αQ unless the lengths satisfy two incompatible congruences. This yields an explicit obstruction for m=2 in the “all n_j≡ (mod a)” regime. A full proof can be written down (it is just the two-arc tiling geometry on the circle).

Caveat. If n_2−n_1 is not divisible by a, the two contributing fibers at a level belong to different residue classes, hence their relative phase is not constrained by periodicity. In that case the above obstruction disappears, so m=2 is not ruled out by this argument alone. The residue partition constraint (Claim A) still applies and can be used to test feasibility once a is fixed.

What really needs to be clarified/proved next
- Formalize a clean residue-class model. For fixed a, S ⊂ Z/aZ is the set of vertical residues of Ω. For each i we pick V_i ⊂ Z/aZ and t_i:Z/aZ→N so that (i) R_i=V_i+S partition Z/aZ, and (ii) the linear balance equations (Claim B) hold on each r∈R_i. This is a finite, checkable system.
- Geometric compatibility on S^1. Beyond the cardinality constraints, one must realize, for each i and each residue r∈R_i, a disjoint exact partition of S^1 by the family of arcs
{I_j + φ : j=1,…,m, φ∈(T_i)_{N−n_j}}, with (T_i)_{u+a}=(T_i)_u + γ_i. This reduces to the following structured task: fix a residue class s, choose a finite set Φ_s ⊂ S^1 (the base fiber phases for that residue); then for every N≡r, the contributing phases are the α-shifts of those Φ_s consistent with (n_j mod a). In the special case S={0} these phases are all the same residue and the relative offsets between different j are rigid multiples of γ_i (useful for contradiction); in the general case (|S|>1), the different j engage different residues and hence different Φ_s, giving more freedom but subject to the residue-partition combinatorics.

Constructive vs. obstructive directions
- Constructive attempt. Take a≥3 and let S have at least two residues modulo a (so that m≥2 and the j’s at a fixed level use different residues). Pick a partition Z/aZ = R_1⊔R_2⊔R_3 and choose V_i such that R_i=V_i+S. Then try to solve the finite system ∑_j ℓ_j t_i(r−n_j)=1 on r∈R_i by picking the ℓ_j and t_i (integers) — a small integer linear programming problem. If solvable, choose for each residue s a finite set Φ_{i,s} of phases arranged so that for each r∈R_i, the disjoint union over j of I_j + Φ_{i,r−n_j} tiles S^1, and enforce periodicity Φ_{i,s}↦Φ_{i,s}+γ_i under s↦s+a. With α,β irrational and rationally independent, one must ensure that the same family (I_j) supports both γ_i=α and γ_i=β. The decoupling across residues (|S|>1) makes this plausible to attempt numerically/combinatorially.
- Obstructive approach. In the rigid regime S={aℤ}-coset (all n_j≡ mod a), the per-level pattern for a periodic component is a translate of a fixed multiset of arcs with relative offsets an arithmetic progression in γ. Showing that a single Ω cannot simultaneously realize γ=α and γ=β in this regime looks approachable via circle geometry or first nonzero Fourier modes. One can encode the per-level tiling constraint for s=±1 in Fourier space: ∑_j c_{j,1} H_i(N−n_j,1)=0. Using (T_i)_{u+a}=(T_i)_u+γ gives H_i(u+a,1)=e^{2πiγ}H_i(u,1). If all n_j≡ mod a, then at a fixed level all H_i(N−n_j,1) equal the same complex number times e^{2πi(s_j)γ}, yielding a single nontrivial exponential polynomial in e^{2πiγ}. Satisfying this both at γ=α and γ=β with α,β rationally independent forces stringent constraints on the c_{j,1} (hence the ℓ_j) that can likely only hold in degenerate/column cases. This line can be developed into a formal obstruction lemma for the S={single residue} case.

Special cases proved/ready-to-formalize
- Lemma 1–4 and Claims A–B above are simple and rigorous; they give a clean finite reduction modulo a and level-wise balance conditions.
- m=1 case: Ω is a column, hence cannot be an example.
- m=2 with all n_j≡ mod a: two-arc geometric obstruction for having two incommensurable γ’s (details can be written now).

Obstacles identified
- Irreducibility is subtle: even if Z/aZ and cardinalities are arranged, one must ensure that no nontrivial partition T_i=T_i^0⊔T_i^1 inherited from the chosen fibers continues to tile product-rectangles. Because each point (u,φ) contributes to multiple adjacent levels (N=u+n_j), the phase design must strongly “entangle” contributions across different N to block such decompositions. The residue graph viewpoint (bipartite graph between U_i and X_i with edges u↔u+n_j) is useful; showing that any admissible T_i induces a connected entanglement w.r.t. this graph is a promising criterion for irreducibility.
- Simultaneously accommodating γ=α and γ=β with a common family (I_j) is the core difficulty. When S is a single residue, we have a strong Fourier/geometry obstruction. When |S|>1, different residues decouple and the degrees of freedom may suffice, but one must navigate the residue-partition constraints R_i=V_i+S.

Concrete next steps (auditable)
1) Formalize and add to proofs.md: Lemmas 1–4 and Claims A–B with complete proofs. These establish the finite reduction modulo a and the key balance identities.
2) Write and prove the two-interval impossibility for the case n_2−n_1≡0 (mod a): a single Ω with two intervals cannot support both (a,α)- and (a,β)-periodic components with α,β irrational and β∉Q+αQ.
3) Explore the finite group model Z/aZ computationally for small a and small |S|≥2: find V_i and residue partitions satisfying R_i=V_i+S and the integer balance system ∑_j ℓ_j t_i(r−n_j)=1, starting with symmetric choices (e.g., a=3,4,5; m=3 or 4; |S|=2). Even one explicit feasible instance (ignoring irreducibility) would narrow the search.
4) Develop a Fourier-mode obstruction in the “rigid” case S={single residue}. Show that if one component is (a,α)-periodic and another is (a,β)-periodic with α,β irrational, then Ω must be a column (or derive a contradiction) whenever all n_j are congruent mod a.
5) Irreducibility criterion: formulate a sufficient “graph connectivity + full-use” condition ensuring that a periodic T_i cannot be split into two tiling components. Then test it on any candidate construction from step 3.

Summary
- The current writeup needs several small but important corrections (periodicity definition, typos, measure specification) and clearer statements about measurability and finiteness of fibers.
- I provided general lemmas: fibers are finite; level-wise (Fourier) balance equations; the relation Xi = Ui + {n_j}; periodicity constraints on fibers; and the residue-class partition Z/aZ = ⊔_i (V_i + S) plus per-residue linear balance. These reduce the problem to a finite combinatorial system modulo a, plus a geometric realization problem on S^1 subject to (a,γ)-periodicity.
- A concrete impossibility holds for m=1 (column) and for m=2 in the rigid case n_2−n_1≡0 (mod a): the same Ω cannot support both (a,α)- and (a,β)-periodic components when α,β are irrational and independent over Q. This is a usable special case.
- For |S|≥2, a construction might be possible (degrees of freedom increase), but must satisfy the residue-partition constraints and an irreducibility criterion. I outlined a precise finite framework to search for such examples or prove they cannot exist.
