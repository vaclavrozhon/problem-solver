# Main Results



Main new result. For every irrational α′ and every prime ℓ≥5 there exists a measurable tile A⊂ℤ×S^1 supported on three columns that is not a column, and a tiling T=T_1⊔T_2 with a partition ℤ=X⊔Y into unions of residue classes mod ℓ such that:
- A+T_1=X×S^1 and A+T_2=Y×S^1;
- T_1 is (ℓ,0)-periodic and T_2 is (ℓ,ℓα′)-periodic (i.e., invariant under addition by (ℓ,ℓα′));
- Neither X nor Y tiles ℤ by finitely many disjoint translates (density obstruction: if X has |R| residues then k disjoint translates tile ℤ iff k|R|=ℓ, impossible for 2≤|R|≤ℓ−2).

Thus the strengthened property asked in the question holds: one can realize the X/Y split with the two periods while ensuring that neither side tiles ℤ on its own.
