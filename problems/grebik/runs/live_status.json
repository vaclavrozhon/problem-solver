Response preview: **Evaluating periodicity and coverage**\n\nOkay, so I\u2019m thinking about how using F might lead to a covering of all Z with overlaps based on periodic mod \u2113. The covering property seems to reduce to something on Z_\u2113 only if I think about F modulo \u2113 and count multiplicity. For each residue r mod \u2113, the number of representations r = p + f mod \u2113 with p in P and f in F is constant, equal to 1. But since F isn\u2019t always reduced mod \u2113 uniquely, I\u2019m curious about these contributions.\n\n**Analyzing periodic s..."
