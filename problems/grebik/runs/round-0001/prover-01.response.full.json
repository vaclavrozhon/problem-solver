Put n_1 = 0, n_2 = 5, n_3 = 10 \u2208 5Z and a_i \u2261 b_i + n_i \u03b1\u2032 (mod 1). Define I_i = [a_i, a_i + L_i) with L_1 = b_2 \u2212 b_1, L_2 = 1 \u2212 b_2, L_3 = b_1.\\n- Let X\u0304 = {0,1} \u2282 Z/5Z (k = 2) and Y\u0304 = {2,3,4} (\u2113 \u2212 k = 3). Neither 2 nor 3 divides 5, so neither X nor Y tiles Z.\\n- Put T_1 = {(m, 0): m \u2261 0 or 1 (mod 5)} and T_2 = {(m, m\u03b1\u2032): m \u2261 2,3,4 (mod 5)}. Then\\n  A + T_1 = (5Z \u222a (5Z + 1)) \u00d7 S^1,  A + T_2 = ((5Z + 2) \u222a (5Z + 3) \u222a (5Z + 4)) \u00d7 S^1,\\n  T_1 is (5, 0)-periodic, T_2 is (5, \u03b1\u2032)-periodic, and A is not a column.\\n\\nWhy this answers the question\\n\\n- We retain all bullets from the modified example (X and Y periodic; a split tiling with \u03b1 = 0 and \u03b1\u2032 irrational; A not a column) and, by enforcing |X\u0304| \u2224 \u2113 and |Y\u0304| \u2224 \u2113, we guarantee \u201cX nor Y tile Z\u201d. The construction works for any irrational \u03b1\u2032 and any chosen period \u2113 \u2265 2.\\n\\nObstacles checked\\n\\n- The need that all occupied columns n_i be congruent modulo \u2113 is essential; otherwise one cannot localize the thinned coset to a prescribed periodic set of columns without spillover (since a single translate contributes to all columns n_i + m). Lemma C ensures we can achieve this while preserving the paper\u2019s Step 1\u20132 geometry.\\n- Boundary issues are avoided by half-open arcs as in the paper; all equalities are a.e.\\n\\nNext steps\\n\\n- Robust generalization: extend to any finite number of \u03b1\u2019s (e.g., multiple irrational slopes) by taking A supported on columns in \u2113Z and thinning each coset to a disjoint family of periodic column sets forming a partition of Z.\\n- Classification question: characterize all periodic partitions X \u2294 Y for which a given A (supported in a subgroup) admits such a split tiling; the above proof shows \u201cif and only if\u201d the single-coset criterion holds for the \u03b1\u2019s in question.\\n- Strengthen the \u201cnon-column\u201d obstruction: quantify how unequal slice measures must be; or produce examples with the minimal number of columns (three is already minimal here) and additional constraints.\\n\"\n}",
