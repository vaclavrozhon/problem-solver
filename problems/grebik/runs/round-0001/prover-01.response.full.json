However, not every periodic set can do this. To tile Z using a subset of density d, there are conditions, like the Coven-Meyerowitz theorem regarding spectral sets. It raises the question of whether an infinite periodic subset, like those formed by residue classes mod \u2113, can tile Z with a finite number of translates\u2014something worth pondering!",

This works when the size of R divides \u2113, but if it doesn't, it\u2019s impossible. Even when it does, not all subsets R qualify; there are conditions involving difference sets to consider.

Then each column r uses only translates whose first coordinates lie in the single congruence class r mod \u2113, so we can independently decide, residue-by-residue, whether that column is filled by the \u03b1=0 tiling or by the \u03b1\u2032 tiling.\\n- Choose \u2113 and the residue set R\u2282Z/\u2113Z so that neither R nor its complement tiles Z by finitely many disjoint translates (density obstruction).\\n\\nKey lemmas (with one-line \u201cwhy useful here\u201d).\\n1) Gluing-by-mod-\u2113 lemma. Suppose A=\u22c3_{i=1}^\u2113 {n_i}\u00d7I_i is a tile such that both S(0)=\u22c3 I_i and S(\u03b1\u2032)=\u22c3(I_i\u2212n_i\u03b1\u2032) equal S^1 a.e. and the families are pairwise a.e. disjoint. If n_i\u2261n_0 (mod \u2113) for all i, then for any partition Z= X\u2294Y into unions of residue classes modulo \u2113,\\n   T_1:= {(m,c_1): m\u2208X},  T_2:= {(m,m\u03b1\u2032+c_2): m\u2208Y}\\n   yield a tiling A+(T_1\u222aT_2)=Z\u00d7S^1 a.e., with A+T_1=X\u00d7S^1 and A+T_2=Y\u00d7S^1.\\n   Why useful: this implements the desired X/Y split with periods in the first coordinate.\\n   Proof sketch. For column r, m=r\u2212n_i\u2261r\u2212n_0 (mod \u2113) is independent of i. If r\u2208X then m\u2208X for every i, so T_1 supplies all needed fibers and T_2 supplies none; coverage and disjointness in that column follow from S(0)=S^1 and the disjointness of {I_i}. If r\u2208Y, the same holds with \u03b1\u2032 and S(\u03b1\u2032). Different columns are disjoint.\\n\\n2) Periodicity. With X, Y unions of residue classes mod \u2113, T_1 is (\u2113,0)-periodic and T_2 is (\u2113,\u2113\u03b1\u2032)-periodic (i.e. invariant under addition by these vectors). Why useful: matches the \u201cperiodic\u201d requirement; note the slope \u03b1\u2032 is preserved.\\n\\n3) Non-tilability of periodic subsets. Let X be periodic mod \u2113 with residue set R of size |R|. If X tiles Z by finitely many disjoint translates, then |R| divides \u2113 (density argument: density(X)=|R|/\u2113, disjoint k-translates force k|R|/\u2113=1). Consequently, if 2\u2264|R|\u2264\u2113\u22122 and \u2113 is prime, neither X nor its complement Y tiles Z by finitely many disjoint translates. Why useful: gives the extra property requested.\\n\\nConstruction (general). Fix an irrational \u03b1\u2032. Choose a prime \u2113\u22655. Pick three integers t_1,t_2,t_3 all congruent modulo \u2113 and with distinct fractional parts b_i={t_i\u03b1\u2032}; this is possible since {r+p\u2113}\u03b1\u2032 runs densely mod 1. Relabel so 0\u2264b_1<b_2<b_3<1 and set\\n- L_1:=b_2\u2212b_1, L_2:=b_3\u2212b_2, L_3:=1\u2212(b_3\u2212b_1),\\n- n_1:=0, n_2:=t_1\u2212t_3, n_3:=t_2\u2212t_3 (note n_j are multiples of \u2113),\\n- a_i:=b_i+n_i\u03b1\u2032 (mod 1), I_i:=[a_i,a_i+L_i), and A:=\u22c3_{i=1}^3 {n_i}\u00d7I_i.\\nBy the paper\u2019s Lemma 2.1 and Theorem 3.1 (steps 1 and 2 therein), S(\u03b1\u2032)=S^1 and S(0)=S^1 a.e., with pairwise a.e. disjointness in both families; hence A+T_{\u03b1\u2032,c} and A+T_{0,c} each tile G. Moreover, since L_1={ (t_2\u2212t_1)\u03b1\u2032} and L_2={ (t_3\u2212t_2)\u03b1\u2032} are both irrational, we do not have all slice measures equal; in particular, taking t_2\u2212t_1=t_3\u2212t_2=\u2113 gives L_1=L_2 irr., L_3=1\u22122L_1\u2260L_1, so A is not a column by the column obstruction lemma in the paper.\\n\\nNow choose a nontrivial residue set R\u2282Z/\u2113Z with 2\u2264|R|\u2264\u2113\u22122 (e.g., \u2113=5 and R={0,2}). Put\\n- X:= {n\u2208Z: n (mod \u2113)\u2208R},\\n- Y:=Z\\\\X,\\n- T_1:= {(m,c_1): m\u2208X},\\n- T_2:= {(m,m\u03b1\u2032+c_2): m\u2208Y}.\\nBy Lemma 1, A+(T_1\u222aT_2) tiles Z\u00d7S^1 a.e., with A+T_1=X\u00d7S^1 and A+T_2=Y\u00d7S^1. By Lemma 2, T_1 is (\u2113,0)-periodic and T_2 is (\u2113,\u2113\u03b1\u2032)-periodic. By Lemma 3 (with \u2113 prime and 2\u2264|R|\u2264\u2113\u22122), neither X nor Y tiles Z by finitely many disjoint translates.\\n\\nFully explicit instance. Take \u03b1\u2032=\u221a2/12, \u2113=5, t_1=0, t_2=5, t_3=10 (these are congruent mod 5 and give distinct fractional parts). Build A as above. Let R={0,2}, hence X=5Z\u222a(5Z+2), Y=(5Z+1)\u222a(5Z+3)\u222a(5Z+4). Then T_1={(m,c_1): m\u22610,2 (mod 5)} and T_2={(m,m\u03b1\u2032+c_2): m\u22611,3,4 (mod 5)}. This satisfies all bullets and neither X (density 2/5) nor Y (density 3/5) can tile Z disjointly.\\n\\nObstacles/notes.\\n- The statement \u201c(\u2113_2,\u03b1\u2032)-periodic\u201d is best interpreted as \u201cperiodic in the first coordinate mod \u2113_2 along the \u03b1\u2032-slope\u201d, i.e., invariance under (\u2113_2,\u2113_2\u03b1\u2032).\\n- The congruence n_i\u2261n_0 (mod \u2113) is essential to keep a whole column assigned to a single coset system.\\n\\nNext steps.\\n- Formalize Lemma 1 (gluing-by-mod-\u2113) in proofs.md with full details.\\n- Add the explicit \u2113=5 instance to output.md, including a short density argument for non-tilability of X and Y.\\n\"\n}",
