Ideas.
- Replace the 2Z gluing by gluing along an arbitrary modulus ℓ≥5, and force the three column indices of A to be all equal modulo ℓ. Then each column r uses only translates whose first coordinates lie in the single congruence class r mod ℓ, so we can independently decide, residue-by-residue, whether that column is filled by the α=0 tiling or by the α′ tiling.
- Choose ℓ and the residue set R⊂Z/ℓZ so that neither R nor its complement tiles Z by finitely many disjoint translates (density obstruction).

Key lemmas (with one-line “why useful here”).
1) Gluing-by-mod-ℓ lemma. Suppose A=⋃_{i=1}^ℓ {n_i}×I_i is a tile such that both S(0)=⋃ I_i and S(α′)=⋃(I_i−n_iα′) equal S^1 a.e. and the families are pairwise a.e. disjoint. If n_i≡n_0 (mod ℓ) for all i, then for any partition Z= X⊔Y into unions of residue classes modulo ℓ,
   T_1:= {(m,c_1): m∈X},  T_2:= {(m,mα′+c_2): m∈Y}
   yield a tiling A+(T_1∪T_2)=Z×S^1 a.e., with A+T_1=X×S^1 and A+T_2=Y×S^1.
   Why useful: this implements the desired X/Y split with periods in the first coordinate.
   Proof sketch. For column r, m=r−n_i≡r−n_0 (mod ℓ) is independent of i. If r∈X then m∈X for every i, so T_1 supplies all needed fibers and T_2 supplies none; coverage and disjointness in that column follow from S(0)=S^1 and the disjointness of {I_i}. If r∈Y, the same holds with α′ and S(α′). Different columns are disjoint.

2) Periodicity. With X, Y unions of residue classes mod ℓ, T_1 is (ℓ,0)-periodic and T_2 is (ℓ,ℓα′)-periodic (i.e. invariant under addition by these vectors). Why useful: matches the “periodic” requirement; note the slope α′ is preserved.

3) Non-tilability of periodic subsets. Let X be periodic mod ℓ with residue set R of size |R|. If X tiles Z by finitely many disjoint translates, then |R| divides ℓ (density argument: density(X)=|R|/ℓ, disjoint k-translates force k|R|/ℓ=1). Consequently, if 2≤|R|≤ℓ−2 and ℓ is prime, neither X nor its complement Y tiles Z by finitely many disjoint translates. Why useful: gives the extra property requested.

Construction (general). Fix an irrational α′. Choose a prime ℓ≥5. Pick three integers t_1,t_2,t_3 all congruent modulo ℓ and with distinct fractional parts b_i={t_iα′}; this is possible since {r+pℓ}α′ runs densely mod 1. Relabel so 0≤b_1<b_2<b_3<1 and set
- L_1:=b_2−b_1, L_2:=b_3−b_2, L_3:=1−(b_3−b_1),
- n_1:=0, n_2:=t_1−t_3, n_3:=t_2−t_3 (note n_j are multiples of ℓ),
- a_i:=b_i+n_iα′ (mod 1), I_i:=[a_i,a_i+L_i), and A:=⋃_{i=1}^3 {n_i}×I_i.
By the paper’s Lemma 2.1 and Theorem 3.1 (steps 1 and 2 therein), S(α′)=S^1 and S(0)=S^1 a.e., with pairwise a.e. disjointness in both families; hence A+T_{α′,c} and A+T_{0,c} each tile G. Moreover, since L_1={ (t_2−t_1)α′} and L_2={ (t_3−t_2)α′} are both irrational, we do not have all slice measures equal; in particular, taking t_2−t_1=t_3−t_2=ℓ gives L_1=L_2 irr., L_3=1−2L_1≠L_1, so A is not a column by the column obstruction lemma in the paper.

Now choose a nontrivial residue set R⊂Z/ℓZ with 2≤|R|≤ℓ−2 (e.g., ℓ=5 and R={0,2}). Put
- X:= {n∈Z: n (mod ℓ)∈R},
- Y:=Z\X,
- T_1:= {(m,c_1): m∈X},
- T_2:= {(m,mα′+c_2): m∈Y}.
By Lemma 1, A+(T_1∪T_2) tiles Z×S^1 a.e., with A+T_1=X×S^1 and A+T_2=Y×S^1. By Lemma 2, T_1 is (ℓ,0)-periodic and T_2 is (ℓ,ℓα′)-periodic. By Lemma 3 (with ℓ prime and 2≤|R|≤ℓ−2), neither X nor Y tiles Z by finitely many disjoint translates.

Fully explicit instance. Take α′=√2/12, ℓ=5, t_1=0, t_2=5, t_3=10 (these are congruent mod 5 and give distinct fractional parts). Build A as above. Let R={0,2}, hence X=5Z∪(5Z+2), Y=(5Z+1)∪(5Z+3)∪(5Z+4). Then T_1={(m,c_1): m≡0,2 (mod 5)} and T_2={(m,mα′+c_2): m≡1,3,4 (mod 5)}. This satisfies all bullets and neither X (density 2/5) nor Y (density 3/5) can tile Z disjointly.

Obstacles/notes.
- The statement “(ℓ_2,α′)-periodic” is best interpreted as “periodic in the first coordinate mod ℓ_2 along the α′-slope”, i.e., invariance under (ℓ_2,ℓ_2α′).
- The congruence n_i≡n_0 (mod ℓ) is essential to keep a whole column assigned to a single coset system.

Next steps.
- Formalize Lemma 1 (gluing-by-mod-ℓ) in proofs.md with full details.
- Add the explicit ℓ=5 instance to output.md, including a short density argument for non-tilability of X and Y.
