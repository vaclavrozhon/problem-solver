  "summary_md": "Affirmative answer: by \u201cgluing\u201d the two single-coset tilings from the attached paper residue-by-residue modulo an integer \u2113 (take \u2113 prime \u22655) we construct A (supported on three columns, not a column) and a tiling T=T_1\u2294T_2 with a partition \u2124=X\u2294Y into unions of residue classes mod \u2113 so that A+T_1=X\u00d7S^1 and A+T_2=Y\u00d7S^1. Here T_1 is (\u2113,0)-periodic and T_2 is (\u2113,\u2113\u03b1')-periodic. Choosing a residue set R with 2\u2264|R|\u2264\u2113\u22122 forces neither X nor Y to tile \u2124 by finitely many disjoint translates (density/counting obstruction k|R|=\u2113). The construction preserves the paper\u2019s non-column property because the three slice measures L_1,L_2,L_3 are unequal. Explicit example: \u03b1'=\u221a2/12, \u2113=5, t=(0,10,5), R={0,2}.

    "Gluing lemma: if all n_i\u22610 (mod \u2113), then for row r the required shifts m=r\u2212n_i all have the same residue r (mod \u2113), so one can assign an entire residue class to T_1 or T_2.",
    "Constructed T_1={(m,c_1):m\u2208X} and T_2={(m,m\u03b1'+c_2):m\u2208Y} giving A+T_1=X\u00d7S^1 and A+T_2=Y\u00d7S^1; no cross-column interference occurs.",
    "Periodicities: T_1 is (\u2113,0)-periodic; T_2 is invariant under addition by (\u2113,\u2113\u03b1') and hence (\u2113,\u2113\u03b1')-periodic (\u2113\u03b1' is irrational).",
    "Non-tilability criterion: for X a union of r residues mod \u2113, k disjoint translates tile \u2124 iff k\u00b7r=\u2113; choosing \u2113 prime and 2\u2264r\u2264\u2113\u22122 ensures neither X nor Y tiles.",
    "Non-column preserved: slice measures L_1,L_2,L_3 (from the three-column construction) are not all equal (irrationality argument), so Lemma (column obstruction) rules out A being a column."
