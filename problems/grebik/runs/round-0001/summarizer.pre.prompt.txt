A paper with a certain tiling result is attached below; we want to improve it. We are still interested in translational tilings with one tile in the space $\mathbb{Z}\times S^1$, where $\mathbb{Z}$ are integers and $S^1$ is the unit circle.
A tile A is a finite union of intervals, that is a set of the form  $A=\bigcup_{i=1}^\ell \{k_i\}\times [a_i,b_i]$, kde indexy $k_i$ se mohou opakovat.
Tiling je mnozina $T\subseteq Z \times S^1$, takova, ze $A+T=Z\times S^1$ a pro $t\not=t'$ je $(A+t)\cap (A+t')$ miry nula.
Dale rekneme, ze $A$ je column, pokud $A$ tiluje množinu $\{n_1,\dots, n_m\}\times S^1$.

After a trivial modification (namely gluing both tilings together by working in $2\mathbb{Z}$), the example in that paper shows that there is a tile $A$ that is not a column together with a tiling $T$ such that we can write $\mathbb{Z}=X\sqcup Y$ and $T=T_1\sqcup T_2$ such that
\begin{itemize}
    \item both $X$ and $Y$ are periodic for some $\ell\in \mathbb{Z}\setminus \{0\}$,
    \item $A+T_1=X\times S^1$ and $A+T_2=Y\times S^1$ 
    \item $T_1$ is $(\ell_1,0)$-periodic and $T_2$ is $(\ell_2,\alpha')$-periodic, where $\alpha'$ is irrational.
\end{itemize}
In the modification of that example, we have that $X=2\mathbb{Z}$ and $Y=2\mathbb{Z}+1$.

My question is if there is a tile $A$ and a tiling $T$ that satisfies everything as above with the additional property that $X$ nor $Y$ tile $\mathbb{Z}$ (in the sense that there are not finitely many disjoint translates of say $X$ that disjointly cover $\mathbb{Z}$, and the same for $Y$).



Here comes the paper.

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\paragraph{Group and measure.}
Let $G=\Z\times \Sone$ with addition $(m,\theta)+(n,\varphi)=(m+n,\theta+\varphi \bmod 1)$.
On $\Z$ we use counting measure and on $\Sone=\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ we use normalized Lebesgue measure~$\mu$;
products and equalities are always understood almost everywhere (a.e.).
Half-open arcs are used to avoid boundary issues.

\paragraph{Tiles and single-coset sets.}
A \emph{tile} is a measurable finite union of columns
\[
A=\bigcup_{i=1}^{\ell} \{n_i\}\times I_i,\qquad n_i\in\Z,\ I_i\subset \Sone \text{ half-open intervals.}
\]
For $\alpha\in[0,1)$ and $c\in \Sone$ put
\[
T_{\alpha,c}:=\{(n,n\alpha+c):n\in\Z\}.
\]
We say that $A$ \emph{tiles $G$ with} $T\subset G$ if $A+T=G$ a.e.\ and the overlaps $(A+t)\cap (A+t')$ have measure zero whenever $t\neq t'$.

\paragraph{Columns.}
We call $A$ a \emph{column} if there exist finite sets $C\subset \Z$ and $\Lambda\subset \Sone$ such that
$A\subset C\times \Sone$ and the family $\{A+(0,\lambda):\lambda\in\Lambda\}$ is pairwise a.e.\ disjoint with
\begin{equation}\label{eq:column-tiling}
\bigcup_{\lambda\in\Lambda}\bigl(A+(0,\lambda)\bigr)=C\times \Sone\quad\text{a.e.}
\end{equation}
(That is, vertical translates by the finite set $\Lambda$ tile the finitely many columns $C$.)

\section{A single-coset criterion and a column obstruction}
\begin{lemma}[single-coset criterion]\label{lem:singlecoset}
Let $A=\bigcup_{i=1}^{\ell} \{n_i\}\times I_i$ and for $\alpha\in[0,1)$ define
\[
S(\alpha):=\bigcup_{i=1}^{\ell} (I_i-n_i\alpha)\subset \Sone.
\]
Then $A+T_{\alpha,c}$ tiles $G$ a.e.\ (for some/every $c$) if and only if the family $\{I_i-n_i\alpha\}_{i=1}^{\ell}$ is pairwise a.e.\ disjoint and $S(\alpha)=\Sone$ a.e.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Fix $r\in\Z$.
Points in $A+T_{\alpha,c}$ with first coordinate $r$ arise by translating $(n_i,\theta)\in A$ by $(r-n_i,(r-n_i)\alpha+c)$, hence the fiber over $r$ equals
\begin{align*}
\bigcup_{i=1}^{\ell}\bigl(I_i+(r-n_i)\alpha+c\bigr)
&= c+r\alpha+\bigcup_{i=1}^{\ell}(I_i-n_i\alpha)\\
&= c+r\alpha+S(\alpha).
\end{align*}
Therefore coverage and disjointness inside the $r$-th column are equivalent to $S(\alpha)=\Sone$ a.e.\ and pairwise a.e.\ disjointness of $\{I_i-n_i\alpha\}$.
Different columns live in disjoint fibers (different first coordinates), so there are no cross-column overlaps.
Since $c$ enters only as a common shift of the fiber, the condition is independent of~$c$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[column obstruction]\label{lem:column-obstruction}
Suppose $A\subset C\times \Sone$ for a finite $C\subset\Z$ and there exists a finite $\Lambda\subset\Sone$ such that
\eqref{eq:column-tiling} holds with pairwise a.e.\ disjoint translates.
Let $A_k:=\{\theta\in\Sone:(k,\theta)\in A\}$.
Then $\mu(A_k)=1/|\Lambda|$ for every $k\in C$.
In particular, if two nonempty column slices of $A$ have different measures, then $A$ is not a column.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Fix $k\in C$. By assumption, for a.e.\ $\theta\in\Sone$ we have
$\sum_{\lambda\in\Lambda} \1_{A_k}(\theta-\lambda)=1$.
Integrating and using translation invariance of $\mu$ gives
$|\Lambda|\cdot \mu(A_k)=1$, as claimed.
\end{proof}

\section{A non-column tile with periods $0$ and an irrational $\alpha'$}
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:main}
Let $\alpha'\in[0,1)$ be irrational.
Then there exists a measurable $A\subset \Z\times \Sone$ supported on three columns that is not a column, yet both $A+T_{0,0}$ and $A+T_{\alpha',0}$ tile $G$ a.e.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
\emph{Parameter choice.}
By density of $\{n\alpha'\bmod 1:n\in\Z\}$, choose distinct $t_1,t_2,t_3\in\Z$ so that the fractional parts
\[
b_i:=\{t_i\alpha'\}\in[0,1)\quad (i=1,2,3)
\]
are pairwise distinct; after relabeling assume $0\le b_1<b_2<b_3<1$.
Set
\[
L_1:=b_2-b_1,\qquad L_2:=b_3-b_2,\qquad L_3:=1-(b_3-b_1),
\]
so $L_1,L_2,L_3>0$ and $L_1+L_2+L_3=1$.
Define
\[
n_1:=0,\qquad n_2:=t_1-t_3,\qquad n_3:=t_2-t_3,
\]
and put
\[
a_i:= b_i+n_i\alpha'\ (\bmod 1),\qquad I_i:=[a_i,a_i+L_i)\subset \Sone.
\]
Let $A:=\{n_1\}\times I_1\ \cup\ \{n_2\}\times I_2\ \cup\ \{n_3\}\times I_3$.

\smallskip
\emph{Step 1 (period $\alpha'$).}
For $\alpha=\alpha'$, Lemma~\ref{lem:singlecoset} gives
\[
I_i-n_i\alpha'=[\,b_i,\ b_i+L_i\,),\quad i=1,2,3,
\]
which are exactly the three consecutive arcs $[b_1,b_2)$, $[b_2,b_3)$, and $[b_3,b_1)$ forming a partition of $\Sone$ (a.e.).
Hence $A+T_{\alpha',0}$ tiles $G$ a.e.

\smallskip
\emph{Step 2 (period $\alpha=0$).}
Write $t_i\alpha'=q_i+b_i$ with $q_i\in\Z$.
Then, modulo $1$,
\begin{align*}
a_1 &\equiv b_1,\\
a_3 &= b_3+(t_2-t_3)\alpha' \equiv b_3+(q_2+b_2-q_3-b_3)\equiv b_2,\\
a_2 &= b_2+(t_1-t_3)\alpha' \equiv b_2+(q_1+b_1-q_3-b_3)\equiv b_1-(b_3-b_2).
\end{align*}
Set $z_1:=a_1\equiv b_1$, $z_3:=a_3\equiv b_2$, and $z_2:=a_2\equiv b_1-(b_3-b_2)$ (all modulo $1$).
The forward cyclic gaps are
\begin{align*}
z_3-z_1 &= L_1,\\
(z_2-z_3)\bmod 1 &= 1-(b_3-b_1)=L_3,\\
(z_1-z_2)\bmod 1 &= b_3-b_2=L_2.
\end{align*}
Therefore $I_1=[z_1,z_1+L_1)$, $I_3=[z_3,z_3+L_3)$, and $I_2=[z_2,z_2+L_2)$ are pairwise disjoint and their union has total length~$1$, hence covers $\Sone$ a.e.
By Lemma~\ref{lem:singlecoset}, $A+T_{0,0}$ tiles $G$ a.e.

\smallskip
\emph{Step 3 (not a column).}
The slice measures in the three occupied columns are $\mu(I_1)=L_1$, $\mu(I_2)=L_2$, $\mu(I_3)=L_3$.
Note that $L_1=b_2-b_1=\{(t_2-t_1)\alpha'\}$ and $L_2=b_3-b_2=\{(t_3-t_2)\alpha'\}$ are fractional parts of nonzero integer multiples of the irrational $\alpha'$, hence $L_1$ and $L_2$ are irrational.
If $L_1=L_2$, then $L_3=1-2L_1\neq L_1$ (since $L_1=1/3$ would be rational).
Thus not all nonempty slice measures are equal.
By Lemma~\ref{lem:column-obstruction}, $A$ cannot be a column.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}[Fully explicit numbers]\label{rem:explicit}
For concreteness, take $\alpha'=\sqrt{2}/12$, $t_1=0$, $t_2=1$, $t_3=3$.
Then $b_1=0$, $b_2=\alpha'$, $b_3\equiv 3\alpha'$ (here $3\alpha'<1$), and
$L_1=\alpha'$, $L_2=2\alpha'$, $L_3=1-3\alpha'$ are distinct.
With $n_1=0$, $n_2=t_1-t_3=-3$, $n_3=t_2-t_3=-2$, the verification in Steps~1--2 applies verbatim.
\end{remark}

\paragraph{Conclusion.}
For every irrational $\alpha'\in[0,1)$ there exists a measurable $A\subset \Z\times\Sone$ that is not a column and tiles $G$ both with period $(1,0)$ and with period $(1,\alpha')$.

Idea: glue the two single-coset tilings (α=0 and α=α′) residue-by-residue modulo ℓ. Ensure all first-coordinate supports of A lie in one congruence class mod ℓ (after a horizontal translation, take n_i∈ℓℤ). Then for column r, the needed integer shifts are m=r−n_i≡r (mod ℓ), independent of i. If we choose a partition ℤ=X⊔Y into unions of residue classes modulo ℓ, define T_1={(m,c_1):m∈X} and T_2={(m,mα′+c_2):m∈Y}. For r∈X, only T_1 supplies the three shifts m=r−n_i, and the fiber is c_1+⋃I_i=S^1 a.e. For r∈Y, only T_2 contributes and the fiber is c_2+rα′+⋃(I_i−n_iα′)=S^1 a.e. No cross-interference occurs because m≡r (mod ℓ).

Choose ℓ prime ≥5 and a residue set R with 2≤|R|≤ℓ−2. Let X be the union of those residues and Y its complement. A density/counting-in-one-period argument shows: k disjoint translates of X tile ℤ iff k|R|=ℓ; hence neither X (density |R|/ℓ) nor Y (density 1−|R|/ℓ) tiles ℤ disjointly.

Compatibility with the 3-column A from the paper: pick t_1,t_2,t_3 all ≡0 (mod ℓ), e.g. an arithmetic progression. The construction of I_i and the disjoint coverings for α=0 and α′ go through verbatim. The column obstruction still applies since not all slice measures L_1,L_2,L_3 are equal. Explicit numbers: α′=√2/12, ℓ=5, (t_1,t_2,t_3)=(0,10,5) (all ≡0 mod 5). Then take R={0,2}, so X=5ℤ∪(5ℤ+2), Y=(5ℤ+1)∪(5ℤ+3)∪(5ℤ+4). Periodicity: T_1 is (5,0)-periodic, T_2 is (5,5α′)-periodic (i.e., invariant under addition by (5,5α′)).

# Main Results



Main new result. For every irrational α′ and every prime ℓ≥5 there exists a measurable tile A⊂ℤ×S^1 supported on three columns that is not a column, and a tiling T=T_1⊔T_2 with a partition ℤ=X⊔Y into unions of residue classes mod ℓ such that:
- A+T_1=X×S^1 and A+T_2=Y×S^1;
- T_1 is (ℓ,0)-periodic and T_2 is (ℓ,ℓα′)-periodic (i.e., invariant under addition by (ℓ,ℓα′));
- Neither X nor Y tiles ℤ by finitely many disjoint translates (density obstruction: if X has |R| residues then k disjoint translates tile ℤ iff k|R|=ℓ, impossible for 2≤|R|≤ℓ−2).

Thus the strengthened property asked in the question holds: one can realize the X/Y split with the two periods while ensuring that neither side tiles ℤ on its own.


=== Verifier Summary ===

We validated and corrected the mod-ℓ gluing scheme: after translating so n_i≡0 (mod ℓ), define X,Y as unions of residue classes mod ℓ and take T_1={(m,c_1):m∈X}, T_2={(m,mα′+c_2):m∈Y}. Then A+(T_1∪T_2) tiles, with A+T_1=X×S^1 and A+T_2=Y×S^1; T_1 is (ℓ,0)-periodic, T_2 is (ℓ,ℓα′)-periodic. Choosing ℓ prime and 2≤|R|≤ℓ−2 ensures neither X nor Y tiles ℤ (density k|R|=ℓ obstruction). Minor fixes: require n_i≡0 (mod ℓ) or shift X by −n_0; clarify periodicity of T_2; adjust explicit numbers. We provide formal lemmas and a theorem establishing an affirmative answer to the question.

# Rigorous Proofs



Lemma (single-coset criterion). Let A=\bigcup_{i=1}^{\ell} \{n_i\}\times I_i with half-open arcs I_i\subset \Sone and define S(\alpha):=\bigcup_{i=1}^{\ell}(I_i-n_i\alpha). Then A+T_{\alpha,c} tiles G a.e. (for some/every c) iff the family \{I_i-n_i\alpha\}_{i=1}^{\ell} is pairwise a.e. disjoint and S(\alpha)=\Sone a.e.
Proof. For each r\in\Z, the fiber of A+T_{\alpha,c} over r equals c+r\alpha+S(\alpha). Disjointness and coverage in this fiber are equivalent to the stated conditions; fibers over different r are disjoint.

Lemma (gluing by a modulus). Fix ℓ\in\Z_{\ge 2}. Let A=\bigcup_{i=1}^{p}\{n_i\}\times I_i be such that the families \{I_i\} and \{I_i-n_i\alpha'\} are pairwise a.e. disjoint and satisfy \bigcup I_i=\Sone a.e. and \bigcup (I_i-n_i\alpha')=\Sone a.e. Assume n_i\in ℓ\Z for all i (after a horizontal translation if necessary). Let X,Y\subset\Z be a partition into unions of residue classes modulo ℓ. Fix c_1,c_2\in\Sone and define
T_1:=\{(m,c_1):m\in X\},\quad T_2:=\{(m,m\alpha'+c_2):m\in Y\},\quad T:=T_1\sqcup T_2.
Then:
(i) A+T=\Z\times \Sone a.e., and overlaps (A+t)\cap(A+t') have measure zero for t\ne t'.
(ii) A+T_1=X\times \Sone a.e. and A+T_2=Y\times \Sone a.e.
(iii) T_1 is invariant under addition by (ℓ,0) and T_2 is invariant under addition by (ℓ,ℓ\alpha').
Proof. Fix r\in\Z. For any i, the only translates contributing to the r-th column are those with first coordinate m=r-n_i. Since n_i\inℓ\Z, m\equiv r (mod ℓ), independent of i. If r\in X then all m=r-n_i lie in X, hence in T_1; none lie in Y, so T_2 contributes nothing to column r. The fiber equals c_1+\bigcup I_i=\Sone a.e., and disjointness inside the fiber follows from pairwise disjointness of \{I_i\}. If r\in Y, the same argument with T_2 yields the fiber c_2+r\alpha'+\bigcup (I_i-n_i\alpha')=\Sone a.e.; disjointness follows from the pairwise disjointness of \{I_i-n_i\alpha'\}. Distinct columns are disjoint, proving (i)–(ii). For (iii), note X and Y are periodic mod ℓ, so (m,c_1)\mapsto(m+ℓ,c_1) preserves T_1, and (m,m\alpha'+c_2)\mapsto(m+ℓ,(m+ℓ)\alpha'+c_2)=(m,m\alpha'+c_2)+(ℓ,ℓ\alpha') preserves T_2.

Lemma (non-tilability of periodic subsets of \Z). Let ℓ\ge 1 and R\subset \Z/ℓ\Z with 1\le r:=|R|\le ℓ. Set X:=\{n\in\Z: n\bmod ℓ\in R\}. If k disjoint translates of X tile \Z, then kr=ℓ. In particular, X tiles \Z by finitely many disjoint translates iff r\mid ℓ; when this holds, exactly k=ℓ/r translates are needed. The same holds for Y=\Z\setminus X, with residue count ℓ-r.
Proof. Work modulo ℓ: in a fundamental period of length ℓ, X occupies exactly r residue classes. Disjoint translates correspond to disjoint shifts of R in \Z/ℓ\Z, so their union has size at most kr. If these shifts cover all ℓ residues, then kr\ge ℓ. Conversely, coverage of \Z forces coverage of each period and hence kr\le ℓ. Therefore kr=ℓ. The remaining statements follow immediately; a density proof gives the same conclusion: density(X)=r/ℓ, additivity of densities for disjoint unions yields k(r/ℓ)=1.

Theorem (answer to the X/Y non-tilability question). Let α' be irrational and let ℓ be a prime with ℓ\ge 5. There exist a measurable tile A supported on three columns that is not a column, a partition \Z=X\sqcup Y into unions of residue classes modulo ℓ, and sets T_1,T_2 as above such that:
(a) A+(T_1\sqcup T_2)=\Z\times \Sone a.e., with A+T_1=X\times \Sone and A+T_2=Y\times \Sone;
(b) T_1 is (ℓ,0)-periodic and T_2 is (ℓ,ℓα')-periodic;
(c) Neither X nor Y tiles \Z by finitely many disjoint translates;
(d) A is not a column.
Proof. Choose t_1,t_2,t_3 in arithmetic progression modulo ℓ, e.g. t_j=s+(j-1)ℓ with s\in\Z; since α' is irrational, the fractional parts b_i=\{t_iα'\} are pairwise distinct. Construct A exactly as in the three-column construction (define L_i, a_i, I_i and n_1=0, n_2=t_1-t_3, n_3=t_2-t_3). Then the single-coset criterion shows A+T_{α',0} and A+T_{0,0} both tile G a.e., and n_i\inℓ\Z for all i. Apply the gluing-by-mod-ℓ lemma with any nontrivial residue set R with 2\le |R|\le ℓ-2, setting X from R and Y=\Z\setminus X; this yields (a)–(b). By the non-tilability lemma and the primality of ℓ, (c) holds. Finally, the slice measures are L_1,L_2,L_3 with L_1+L_2+L_3=1 and, by irrationality of α', not all equal; hence A is not a column by the column-slice obstruction (if all nonempty slices had equal measure they would each equal 1/|\Lambda|, impossible here). Remark: one can ensure L_1\ne L_2 by taking t_2-t_1=t_3-t_2=ℓ, which forces L_1=L_2 to be irrational, hence L_3=1-2L_1\ne L_1.

Remark (explicit instance). Take α'=\sqrt{2}/12, ℓ=5, and (t_1,t_2,t_3)=(0,10,5). Build A as above. Let R=\{0,2\}, so X=5\Z\cup(5\Z+2), Y=(5\Z+1)\cup(5\Z+3)\cup(5\Z+4). Then A+T_1=X\times\Sone, A+T_2=Y\times\Sone, T_1 is (5,0)-periodic, T_2 is (5,5α')-periodic, and neither X nor Y tiles \Z by finitely many disjoint translates.
