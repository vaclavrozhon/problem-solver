Affirmative answer: by “gluing” the two single-coset tilings from the attached paper residue-by-residue modulo an integer ℓ (take ℓ prime ≥5) we construct A (supported on three columns, not a column) and a tiling T=T_1⊔T_2 with a partition ℤ=X⊔Y into unions of residue classes mod ℓ so that A+T_1=X×S^1 and A+T_2=Y×S^1. Here T_1 is (ℓ,0)-periodic and T_2 is (ℓ,ℓα')-periodic. Choosing a residue set R with 2≤|R|≤ℓ−2 forces neither X nor Y to tile ℤ by finitely many disjoint translates (density/counting obstruction k|R|=ℓ). The construction preserves the paper’s non-column property because the three slice measures L_1,L_2,L_3 are unequal. Explicit example: α'=√2/12, ℓ=5, t=(0,10,5), R={0,2}.
