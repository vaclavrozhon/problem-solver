  "feedback_md": "Your mod-\u2113 gluing idea is on target and (after a small correction) gives an affirmative answer to the posed question. The key is to force all first-coordinate positions of A to lie in a single residue class modulo \u2113 (conveniently 0), so that for each column r the three requisite translation parameters m=r\u2212n_i fall in the same residue class as r. Then, if X and Y are unions of residue classes mod \u2113 partitioning \u2124, exactly one of the two systems (\u03b1=0 or \u03b1=\u03b1\u2032) operates in column r according to whether r\u2208X or r\u2208Y.\n\nCorrections/clarifications.\n- Gluing-by-mod-\u2113 lemma: as stated, \u201cif n_i\u2261n_0 (mod \u2113) then r\u2208X \u21d2 m\u2208X\u201d is not generally true unless X is chosen with residues shifted by \u2212n_0. The clean version is: after translating A by (\u2212n_0,0), assume n_i\u22610 (mod \u2113) for all i; then m\u2261r (mod \u2113), so r\u2208X \u21d4 m\u2208X. We encode this in the formal lemma below.\n- Periodicity notation: T_2={(m,m\u03b1\u2032+c_2):m\u2208Y} is invariant under (\u2113,\u2113\u03b1\u2032), not under (\u2113,\u03b1\u2032). Your parenthetical remark matches this; we will state periodicity as invariance under that vector.\n- Explicit instance: with \u03b1\u2032=\u221a2/12, \u2113=5, if you keep t_1=0,t_2=5,t_3=10 then b_3<b_2. This is harmless (we can relabel), but to match \u201c0\u2264b_1<b_2<b_3<1\u201d you can take (t_1,t_2,t_3)=(0,10,5), still all \u22610 (mod 5).\n\nSoundness of the construction. With the corrected lemma, the proof that A+(T_1\u222aT_2) tiles is straightforward: in column r\u2208X, the fiber equals c_1+\u22c3 I_i=S^1 a.e., and only T_1 contributes; in column r\u2208Y, the fiber equals c_2+r\u03b1\u2032+\u22c3(I_i\u2212n_i\u03b1\u2032)=S^1 a.e., and only T_2 contributes. Disjointness across different t\u2019s follows from pairwise disjointness of the relevant families and from separation of columns. The \u201cA not a column\u201d obstruction via unequal slice measures carries over unchanged from the paper.\n\nNon-tilability of X and Y. Your density argument is correct but can be sharpened: if X has residue set R\u2282\u2124/\u2113\u2124, then k disjoint translates tile \u2124 iff k|R|=\u2113. Thus for prime \u2113 and 2\u2264|R|\u2264\u2113\u22122, neither X nor Y tiles \u2124 by finitely many disjoint translates.\n\nNext steps.\n- Formalize (and use) the corrected gluing-by-mod-\u2113 lemma in proofs.md.\n- Add the density/non-tilability lemma with a short proof by counting in one period.\n- State and prove the final theorem answering the question (choose prime \u2113\u22655 and 2\u2264|R|\u2264\u2113\u22122), and include a fully explicit instance.\n- Align the periodicity statement for T_2 as invariance under (\u2113,\u2113\u03b1\u2032).",
  "summary_md": "We validated and corrected the mod-\u2113 gluing scheme: after translating so n_i\u22610 (mod \u2113), define X,Y as unions of residue classes mod \u2113 and take T_1={(m,c_1):m\u2208X}, T_2={(m,m\u03b1\u2032+c_2):m\u2208Y}.

Choosing \u2113 prime and 2\u2264|R|\u2264\u2113\u22122 ensures neither X nor Y tiles \u2124 (density k|R|=\u2113 obstruction). Minor fixes: require n_i\u22610 (mod \u2113) or shift X by \u2212n_0; clarify periodicity of T_2; adjust explicit numbers.

Ensure all first-coordinate supports of A lie in one congruence class mod \u2113 (after a horizontal translation, take n_i\u2208\u2113\u2124). Then for column r, the needed integer shifts are m=r\u2212n_i\u2261r (mod \u2113), independent of i.

For r\u2208X, only T_1 supplies the three shifts m=r\u2212n_i, and the fiber is c_1+\u22c3I_i=S^1 a.e.

Let X be the union of those residues and Y its complement. A density/counting-in-one-period argument shows: k disjoint translates of X tile \u2124 iff k|R|=\u2113; hence neither X (density |R|/\u2113) nor Y (density 1\u2212|R|/\u2113) tiles \u2124 disjointly.\n\nCompatibility with the 3-column A from the paper: pick t_1,t_2,t_3 all \u22610 (mod \u2113), e.g. an arithmetic progression. The construction of I_i and the disjoint coverings for \u03b1=0 and \u03b1\u2032 go through verbatim. The column obstruction still applies since not all slice measures L_1,L_2,L_3 are equal. Explicit numbers: \u03b1\u2032=\u221a2/12, \u2113=5, (t_1,t_2,t_3)=(0,10,5) (all \u22610 mod 5). Then take R={0,2}, so X=5\u2124\u222a(5\u2124+2), Y=(5\u2124+1)\u222a(5\u2124+3)\u222a(5\u2124+4).

For each r\\in\\Z, the fiber of A+T_{\\alpha,c} over r equals c+r\\alpha+S(\\alpha). Disjointness and coverage in this fiber are equivalent to the stated conditions; fibers over different r are disjoint.\n\nLemma (gluing by a modulus). Fix \u2113\\in\\Z_{\\ge 2}.

Fix r\\in\\Z. For any i, the only translates contributing to the r-th column are those with first coordinate m=r-n_i. Since n_i\\in\u2113\\Z, m\\equiv r (mod \u2113), independent of i. If r\\in X then all m=r-n_i lie in X, hence in T_1; none lie in Y, so T_2 contributes nothing to column r. The fiber equals c_1+\\bigcup I_i=\\Sone a.e., and disjointness inside the fiber follows from pairwise disjointness of \\{I_i\\}. If r\\in Y, the same argument with T_2 yields the fiber c_2+r\\alpha'+\\bigcup (I_i-n_i\\alpha')=\\Sone a.e.; disjointness follows from the pairwise disjointness of \\{I_i-n_i\\alpha'\\}. Distinct columns are disjoint, proving (i)\u2013(ii). For (iii), note X and Y are periodic mod \u2113, so (m,c_1)\\mapsto(m+\u2113,c_1) preserves T_1, and (m,m\\alpha'+c_2)\\mapsto(m+\u2113,(m+\u2113)\\alpha'+c_2)=(m,m\\alpha'+c_2)+(\u2113,\u2113\\alpha') preserves T_2.\n\nLemma (non-tilability of periodic subsets of \\Z). Let \u2113\\ge 1 and R\\subset \\Z/\u2113\\Z with 1\\le r:=|R|\\le \u2113. Set X:=\\{n\\in\\Z: n\\bmod \u2113\\in R\\}. If k disjoint translates of X tile \\Z, then kr=\u2113. In particular, X tiles \\Z by finitely many disjoint translates iff r\\mid \u2113; when this holds, exactly k=\u2113/r translates are needed. The same holds for Y=\\Z\\setminus X, with residue count \u2113-r.\nProof. Work modulo \u2113: in a fundamental period of length \u2113, X occupies exactly r residue classes. Disjoint translates correspond to disjoint shifts of R in \\Z/\u2113\\Z, so their union has size at most kr. If these shifts cover all \u2113 residues, then kr\\ge \u2113. Conversely, coverage of \\Z forces coverage of each period and hence kr\\le \u2113. Therefore kr=\u2113. The remaining statements follow immediately; a density proof gives the same conclusion: density(X)=r/\u2113, additivity of densities for disjoint unions yields k(r/\u2113)=1.\n\nTheorem (answer to the X/Y non-tilability question). Let \u03b1' be irrational and let \u2113 be a prime with \u2113\\ge 5. There exist a measurable tile A supported on three columns that is not a column, a partition \\Z=X\\sqcup Y into unions of residue classes modulo \u2113, and sets T_1,T_2 as above such that:\n(a) A+(T_1\\sqcup T_2)=\\Z\\times \\Sone a.e., with A+T_1=X\\times \\Sone and A+T_2=Y\\times \\Sone;\n(b) T_1 is (\u2113,0)-periodic and T_2 is (\u2113,\u2113\u03b1')-periodic;\n(c) Neither X nor Y tiles \\Z by finitely many disjoint translates;\n(d) A is not a column.\nProof. Choose t_1,t_2,t_3 in arithmetic progression modulo \u2113, e.g. t_j=s+(j-1)\u2113 with s\\in\\Z; since \u03b1' is irrational, the fractional parts b_i=\\{t_i\u03b1'\\} are pairwise distinct. Construct A exactly as in the three-column construction (define L_i, a_i, I_i and n_1=0, n_2=t_1-t_3, n_3=t_2-t_3). Then the single-coset criterion shows A+T_{\u03b1',0} and A+T_{0,0} both tile G a.e., and n_i\\in\u2113\\Z for all i. Apply the gluing-by-mod-\u2113 lemma with any nontrivial residue set R with 2\\le |R|\\le \u2113-2, setting X from R and Y=\\Z\\setminus X; this yields (a)\u2013(b). By the non-tilability lemma and the primality of \u2113, (c) holds. Finally, the slice measures are L_1,L_2,L_3 with L_1+L_2+L_3=1 and, by irrationality of \u03b1', not all equal; hence A is not a column by the column-slice obstruction (if all nonempty slices had equal measure they would each equal 1/|\\Lambda|, impossible here). Remark: one can ensure L_1\\ne L_2 by taking t_2-t_1=t_3-t_2=\u2113, which forces L_1=L_2 to be irrational, hence L_3=1-2L_1\\ne L_1.\n\nRemark (explicit instance). Take \u03b1'=\\sqrt{2}/12, \u2113=5, and (t_1,t_2,t_3)=(0,10,5). Build A as above. Let R=\\{0,2\\}, so X=5\\Z\\cup(5\\Z+2), Y=(5\\Z+1)\\cup(5\\Z+3)\\cup(5\\Z+4). Then A+T_1=X\\times\\Sone, A+T_2=Y\\times\\Sone, T_1 is (5,0)-periodic, T_2 is (5,5\u03b1')-periodic, and neither X nor Y tiles \\Z by finitely many disjoint translates."
