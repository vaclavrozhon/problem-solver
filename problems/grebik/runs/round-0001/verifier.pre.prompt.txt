A paper with a certain tiling result is attached below; we want to improve it. We are still interested in translational tilings with one tile in the space $\mathbb{Z}\times S^1$, where $\mathbb{Z}$ are integers and $S^1$ is the unit circle.
A tile A is a finite union of intervals, that is a set of the form  $A=\bigcup_{i=1}^\ell \{k_i\}\times [a_i,b_i]$, kde indexy $k_i$ se mohou opakovat.
Tiling je mnozina $T\subseteq Z \times S^1$, takova, ze $A+T=Z\times S^1$ a pro $t\not=t'$ je $(A+t)\cap (A+t')$ miry nula.
Dale rekneme, ze $A$ je column, pokud $A$ tiluje množinu $\{n_1,\dots, n_m\}\times S^1$.

After a trivial modification (namely gluing both tilings together by working in $2\mathbb{Z}$), the example in that paper shows that there is a tile $A$ that is not a column together with a tiling $T$ such that we can write $\mathbb{Z}=X\sqcup Y$ and $T=T_1\sqcup T_2$ such that
\begin{itemize}
    \item both $X$ and $Y$ are periodic for some $\ell\in \mathbb{Z}\setminus \{0\}$,
    \item $A+T_1=X\times S^1$ and $A+T_2=Y\times S^1$ 
    \item $T_1$ is $(\ell_1,0)$-periodic and $T_2$ is $(\ell_2,\alpha')$-periodic, where $\alpha'$ is irrational.
\end{itemize}
In the modification of that example, we have that $X=2\mathbb{Z}$ and $Y=2\mathbb{Z}+1$.

My question is if there is a tile $A$ and a tiling $T$ that satisfies everything as above with the additional property that $X$ nor $Y$ tile $\mathbb{Z}$ (in the sense that there are not finitely many disjoint translates of say $X$ that disjointly cover $\mathbb{Z}$, and the same for $Y$).



Here comes the paper.

\title{A non-column tile in $\Z\times \Sone$ with periods $\alpha=0$ and $\alpha'\notin\mathbb{Q}$}
\author{}
\date{}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\paragraph{Group and measure.}
Let $G=\Z\times \Sone$ with addition $(m,\theta)+(n,\varphi)=(m+n,\theta+\varphi \bmod 1)$.
On $\Z$ we use counting measure and on $\Sone=\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ we use normalized Lebesgue measure~$\mu$;
products and equalities are always understood almost everywhere (a.e.).
Half-open arcs are used to avoid boundary issues.

\paragraph{Tiles and single-coset sets.}
A \emph{tile} is a measurable finite union of columns
\[
A=\bigcup_{i=1}^{\ell} \{n_i\}\times I_i,\qquad n_i\in\Z,\ I_i\subset \Sone \text{ half-open intervals.}
\]
For $\alpha\in[0,1)$ and $c\in \Sone$ put
\[
T_{\alpha,c}:=\{(n,n\alpha+c):n\in\Z\}.
\]
We say that $A$ \emph{tiles $G$ with} $T\subset G$ if $A+T=G$ a.e.\ and the overlaps $(A+t)\cap (A+t')$ have measure zero whenever $t\neq t'$.

\paragraph{Columns.}
We call $A$ a \emph{column} if there exist finite sets $C\subset \Z$ and $\Lambda\subset \Sone$ such that
$A\subset C\times \Sone$ and the family $\{A+(0,\lambda):\lambda\in\Lambda\}$ is pairwise a.e.\ disjoint with
\begin{equation}\label{eq:column-tiling}
\bigcup_{\lambda\in\Lambda}\bigl(A+(0,\lambda)\bigr)=C\times \Sone\quad\text{a.e.}
\end{equation}
(That is, vertical translates by the finite set $\Lambda$ tile the finitely many columns $C$.)

\section{A single-coset criterion and a column obstruction}
\begin{lemma}[single-coset criterion]\label{lem:singlecoset}
Let $A=\bigcup_{i=1}^{\ell} \{n_i\}\times I_i$ and for $\alpha\in[0,1)$ define
\[
S(\alpha):=\bigcup_{i=1}^{\ell} (I_i-n_i\alpha)\subset \Sone.
\]
Then $A+T_{\alpha,c}$ tiles $G$ a.e.\ (for some/every $c$) if and only if the family $\{I_i-n_i\alpha\}_{i=1}^{\ell}$ is pairwise a.e.\ disjoint and $S(\alpha)=\Sone$ a.e.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Fix $r\in\Z$.
Points in $A+T_{\alpha,c}$ with first coordinate $r$ arise by translating $(n_i,\theta)\in A$ by $(r-n_i,(r-n_i)\alpha+c)$, hence the fiber over $r$ equals
\begin{align*}
\bigcup_{i=1}^{\ell}\bigl(I_i+(r-n_i)\alpha+c\bigr)
&= c+r\alpha+\bigcup_{i=1}^{\ell}(I_i-n_i\alpha)\\
&= c+r\alpha+S(\alpha).
\end{align*}
Therefore coverage and disjointness inside the $r$-th column are equivalent to $S(\alpha)=\Sone$ a.e.\ and pairwise a.e.\ disjointness of $\{I_i-n_i\alpha\}$.
Different columns live in disjoint fibers (different first coordinates), so there are no cross-column overlaps.
Since $c$ enters only as a common shift of the fiber, the condition is independent of~$c$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[column obstruction]\label{lem:column-obstruction}
Suppose $A\subset C\times \Sone$ for a finite $C\subset\Z$ and there exists a finite $\Lambda\subset\Sone$ such that
\eqref{eq:column-tiling} holds with pairwise a.e.\ disjoint translates.
Let $A_k:=\{\theta\in\Sone:(k,\theta)\in A\}$.
Then $\mu(A_k)=1/|\Lambda|$ for every $k\in C$.
In particular, if two nonempty column slices of $A$ have different measures, then $A$ is not a column.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Fix $k\in C$. By assumption, for a.e.\ $\theta\in\Sone$ we have
$\sum_{\lambda\in\Lambda} \1_{A_k}(\theta-\lambda)=1$.
Integrating and using translation invariance of $\mu$ gives
$|\Lambda|\cdot \mu(A_k)=1$, as claimed.
\end{proof}

\section{A non-column tile with periods $0$ and an irrational $\alpha'$}
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:main}
Let $\alpha'\in[0,1)$ be irrational.
Then there exists a measurable $A\subset \Z\times \Sone$ supported on three columns that is not a column, yet both $A+T_{0,0}$ and $A+T_{\alpha',0}$ tile $G$ a.e.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
\emph{Parameter choice.}
By density of $\{n\alpha'\bmod 1:n\in\Z\}$, choose distinct $t_1,t_2,t_3\in\Z$ so that the fractional parts
\[
b_i:=\{t_i\alpha'\}\in[0,1)\quad (i=1,2,3)
\]
are pairwise distinct; after relabeling assume $0\le b_1<b_2<b_3<1$.
Set
\[
L_1:=b_2-b_1,\qquad L_2:=b_3-b_2,\qquad L_3:=1-(b_3-b_1),
\]
so $L_1,L_2,L_3>0$ and $L_1+L_2+L_3=1$.
Define
\[
n_1:=0,\qquad n_2:=t_1-t_3,\qquad n_3:=t_2-t_3,
\]
and put
\[
a_i:= b_i+n_i\alpha'\ (\bmod 1),\qquad I_i:=[a_i,a_i+L_i)\subset \Sone.
\]
Let $A:=\{n_1\}\times I_1\ \cup\ \{n_2\}\times I_2\ \cup\ \{n_3\}\times I_3$.

\smallskip
\emph{Step 1 (period $\alpha'$).}
For $\alpha=\alpha'$, Lemma~\ref{lem:singlecoset} gives
\[
I_i-n_i\alpha'=[\,b_i,\ b_i+L_i\,),\quad i=1,2,3,
\]
which are exactly the three consecutive arcs $[b_1,b_2)$, $[b_2,b_3)$, and $[b_3,b_1)$ forming a partition of $\Sone$ (a.e.).
Hence $A+T_{\alpha',0}$ tiles $G$ a.e.

\smallskip
\emph{Step 2 (period $\alpha=0$).}
Write $t_i\alpha'=q_i+b_i$ with $q_i\in\Z$.
Then, modulo $1$,
\begin{align*}
a_1 &\equiv b_1,\\
a_3 &= b_3+(t_2-t_3)\alpha' \equiv b_3+(q_2+b_2-q_3-b_3)\equiv b_2,\\
a_2 &= b_2+(t_1-t_3)\alpha' \equiv b_2+(q_1+b_1-q_3-b_3)\equiv b_1-(b_3-b_2).
\end{align*}
Set $z_1:=a_1\equiv b_1$, $z_3:=a_3\equiv b_2$, and $z_2:=a_2\equiv b_1-(b_3-b_2)$ (all modulo $1$).
The forward cyclic gaps are
\begin{align*}
z_3-z_1 &= L_1,\\
(z_2-z_3)\bmod 1 &= 1-(b_3-b_1)=L_3,\\
(z_1-z_2)\bmod 1 &= b_3-b_2=L_2.
\end{align*}
Therefore $I_1=[z_1,z_1+L_1)$, $I_3=[z_3,z_3+L_3)$, and $I_2=[z_2,z_2+L_2)$ are pairwise disjoint and their union has total length~$1$, hence covers $\Sone$ a.e.
By Lemma~\ref{lem:singlecoset}, $A+T_{0,0}$ tiles $G$ a.e.

\smallskip
\emph{Step 3 (not a column).}
The slice measures in the three occupied columns are $\mu(I_1)=L_1$, $\mu(I_2)=L_2$, $\mu(I_3)=L_3$.
Note that $L_1=b_2-b_1=\{(t_2-t_1)\alpha'\}$ and $L_2=b_3-b_2=\{(t_3-t_2)\alpha'\}$ are fractional parts of nonzero integer multiples of the irrational $\alpha'$, hence $L_1$ and $L_2$ are irrational.
If $L_1=L_2$, then $L_3=1-2L_1\neq L_1$ (since $L_1=1/3$ would be rational).
Thus not all nonempty slice measures are equal.
By Lemma~\ref{lem:column-obstruction}, $A$ cannot be a column.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}[Fully explicit numbers]\label{rem:explicit}
For concreteness, take $\alpha'=\sqrt{2}/12$, $t_1=0$, $t_2=1$, $t_3=3$.
Then $b_1=0$, $b_2=\alpha'$, $b_3\equiv 3\alpha'$ (here $3\alpha'<1$), and
$L_1=\alpha'$, $L_2=2\alpha'$, $L_3=1-3\alpha'$ are distinct.
With $n_1=0$, $n_2=t_1-t_3=-3$, $n_3=t_2-t_3=-2$, the verification in Steps~1--2 applies verbatim.
\end{remark}

\paragraph{Conclusion.}
For every irrational $\alpha'\in[0,1)$ there exists a measurable $A\subset \Z\times\Sone$ that is not a column and tiles $G$ both with period $(1,0)$ and with period $(1,\alpha')$.

**Exploring translational tilings**

I'm considering the theory of translational tilings of the integers, where sets of integers tile Z through shifts. They involve taking finite disjoint translates of a set X to cover Z completely. The challenge is to find periodic sets X and Y that do not tile Z, despite being periodic. For instance, while X=2Z tiles Z using two translates, they want X and Y to cover Z without their combined translates doing so, which seems tricky given their periodicity.

**Analyzing tiling conditions**

I’m looking into the conditions for a set X to tile Z. They require a finite set F such that the translates {X+f: f∈F} partition Z completely. Since X is periodic modulo ℓ, X tiles Z if the union of residues from F covers all residues in mod ℓ, with disjoint translates. This simplifies to a tiling problem in the cyclic group Z_ℓ. It's interesting that the requirement for X and Y not to tile Z translates to their subsets not being translational tiles of Z_ℓ, which keeps everything nicely organized!

**Exploring tiling relationships**

I'm pondering whether if one subset can tile Z_ℓ, the other can too. I'm considering subsets A of Z_n that might not tile Z_n or their complement neither. For instance, in Z_6, if A={0,1}, can I find a subset B that satisfies disjoint tiling? The requirements for tileable subsets of Z_n include factors of cyclotomic polynomials and sizes that divide n. It's interesting that the complement of a tile can also tile only if it maintains certain properties, which links to the concept of complementary tiles.

**Examining tiling partners**

I’m thinking about how a complement of a tiling partner B relates to the union of copies. The idea of tiles means A+F is disjoint and that F is the tiling complement of A. However, the complement of A in G, which is G\A, doesn't always tile. So, for both A and its complement to not tile, that's possible for generic A. I can consider X as a periodic set that doesn't tile mod ℓ, while Y as Z\X remains periodic too. I need to ensure they cover specific sets properly through coset tilings and that globally, they create a split tiling.

**Analyzing tiling structures**

I’m diving into the construction of single-coset tilings T_{α, c}, where the entire Z is used to tile G, but we can restrict to a subset of columns X. This involves a horizontal periodicity added to T. The challenge is whether we can find unions of multiple cosets while adjusting for columns. They mention working in 2Z, defining A to tile even n while using different α for odd columns. I realize that if I restrict T to certain coordinates, the resulting coverage in columns depends on how I manage the contributions from T, which could lead to uncovered columns. To split these tilings into disjoint parts, I need to ensure T1 and T2 cover appropriately based on their respective columns X and Y, maintaining periodicity.

**Exploring periodic tiling conditions**

I'm examining the periodicity of tiling structures T1 and T2. If T1 is (ℓ1, 0)-periodic and T2 is (ℓ2, α')-periodic with α' irrational, the restriction to X columns maintains periodicity based on the set's structure. I need to ensure that both X and its complement Y do not tile under finite translates when ℓ is composite. 

Specifically, I'm considering sizes that won't divide ℓ. For example, choosing ℓ=10 and k=4 allows both sets X and Y to not tile Z_ℓ effectively. It’s crucial for the construction to ensure disjoint coverage while maintaining their periodic properties for each column based on assigned values.

**Analyzing tiling conditions**

I'm reviewing the conditions required for T1 to be (ℓ1, 0)-periodic and T2 to be (ℓ2, α')-periodic. It seems I can set ℓ1 and ℓ2 equal to ℓ where both X and Y are also ℓ-periodic. For T1, based on the lemma, if we tile a specific column using specific values c, we have to consider how many points t we actually include. 

I need to ensure that the coverage remains disjoint across different columns, so I must choose t such that each belongs to a specific column in X. This requires a careful choice of integers so that the coverage aligns exactly with the desired columns, avoiding overlaps.

**Evaluating tiling strategy**

I need to ensure that for the tiling of the columns, I include exactly one t per i from the intervals I_i. Each t with a first coordinate m influences multiple columns, specifically those of the form n_i + m. To restrict coverage to X without overlapping Y, I have to be careful with how I assign these t values.

It looks like I can achieve this by ensuring that the n_i values are congruent to 0 modulo ℓ for T1, while allowing for a different choice for T2. This way, I'll maintain the desired disjointness and partition. The idea of working in 2Z ensures proper coverage without accidental overlaps between even and odd columns, thereby satisfying the partition requirements effectively!

**Generalizing periodic subsets**

To create periodic subsets X and Y that are not tileable, I need to pick a period ℓ0 that is either prime or composite, ensuring both sizes do not divide ℓ0. I can also utilize a Minkowski sum structure to derive X and Y from cosets M and M'. If N is chosen from ℓ0Z, this can simplify things. Moreover, by aligning M and M' to be disjoint and selecting corresponding T1 and T2 sets, I can ensure they respect the necessary periodic outputs without overlapping. It's crucial to monitor how coverage in each column interacts to maintain the partition.

**Verifying tiling and periodicity**

I want to ensure that for every r in X, there exists an m in M such that each m results from the formula r - n_i for some i. This approach confirms that T1 will only cover columns in X, while T2 will cover columns in Y. I need to ensure A + T forms a global tiling and is pairwise disjoint. Also, neither X nor Y can tile Z if their sizes don’t divide ℓ0. For any chosen ℓ0, I’ll demonstrate that valid periodic partitions maintain these properties and ensure A isn’t just a column by tweaking n_i accordingly.

**Structuring the proof and tiling**

I’ll define the lengths for I_i and choose sets M and M' as complements to confirm that X and Y do not tile Z. After ensuring that |X̄| and |Ȳ| do not divide 10, I need to analyze potential overlaps in T1 and T2. They seem disjoint because T1 operates on X columns and T2 on Y columns. However, I must confirm that T contains distinct m values to avoid complications from duplicates. Therefore, I can construct a tile A and verify it using a periodic partition for Z, ensuring the conditions hold.

**Clarifying definitions and proofs**

I’ll choose ℓ0 = 10 and k = 4, defining T1 and T2 based on residues. I need to show that A + T1 equals X × S^1 and A + T2 equals Y × S^1 almost everywhere. Next, it’s crucial that T1 is (ℓ0, 0)-periodic and T2 is (ℓ0, α')-periodic while proving A isn’t a column by slice measures. I should make sure that X and Y do not tile Z, which involves confirming that their cardinalities don’t divide 10. Additionally, I’ll need to address potential duplicates in definitions.

**Analyzing distinct t contributions**

I need to ensure that for each r in Y, the number of distinct t's matches the number of indices i, since each m = r - n_i comes from Y. If some n_i overlap, it could mean fewer t's are used, but this doesn’t reduce overall coverage; it just changes the count of t's. I'm realizing duplicates don’t affect measure because overlaps are of measure zero. It’s essential that when I use any t, it consistently covers the same arcs across the column without causing conflicts. Ultimately, even if t's coincide, their combined effect on the union remains intact.

**Re-evaluating fiber properties**

Let's take another look: The fiber for A + T_{α, c} is supposed to equal c + r α + S(α), but that only holds if T contains the specific coset T_{α, c}. If T is just an arbitrary subset, then for each column r, the fiber becomes a union over t in T of the arcs generated by t.

Now, if we only have some m values, the contributions depend on what m’s are included. For a fixed t, we find contributions only when m = r - n_i for a distinct index i. Assuming n_i are distinct simplifies things. So, to cover all required arcs, we need T to include m for all r - n_i from the specified set. It's essential to include all m's for full coverage in T.

**Examining periodic functions and coverage**

If N is a subset of ℓ0 Z and X is periodic mod ℓ0, then X minus n_i equals X, meaning M equals X for each i. This means the first coordinates of T1 must match X and T2 must match Y, which shows they effectively cover their assigned columns. 

I must ensure that T1 and T2 are disjoint across all pairs of t values. The arcs in the same column for the α case are indeed disjoint due to their properties. T1 and T2 have infinite sizes, but they maintain pairwise disjointness when expressed appropriately. I've demonstrated that T1 is periodic under specific conditions and that such constructions are valid. 

Providing clear examples will help clarify these points further!

**Formulating periodic structures and proofs**

I need to ensure that A's columns align with multiples of ℓ. The lemma states that for any α values alongside appropriate lengths and offsets, integers n_i can be found that are multiples of ℓ, corresponding to arcs I_i. We must confirm that the union of these arcs retains the structure of S^1 almost everywhere.

My goal is to propose improvements to the attached paper, particularly the splitting into any periodic partitions X and Y instead of only evens and odds. This process is aimed at achieving consistent incremental progress. 

Additionally, I must clarify the periodic characteristics of T1 and T2, ensuring they remain invariant under their defined conditions. The mathematical properties and constructive examples will support these assertions, paving the way for a rigorous proof structure. I’m also excited to detail explicit numerical examples to illustrate the concepts!

**Analyzing coverage and rescaling properties**

I’m focusing on a specialized case where N is a subset of ℓZ. I define M as X, and if X comprises cosets mod ℓ, then I can use this structure to assert complete coverage for r in X. The goal is to demonstrate that A + T_M precisely equals X × S^1. 

Now, the rescaling lemma states that positive lengths L_i summing to 1 can support a tile A in any prescribed congruence class. However, I have to be cautious about maintaining the disjointness of intervals I_i when α=0; the original paper outlines relationships among a_i that need to be preserved to ensure coverage of S^1. If these details slip, I could end up with overlaps or coverage problems. 

I need to ensure that while adjusting parameters, I keep the fundamental properties intact, especially regarding how n_i interacts with the congruences while scaling. It’s a delicate balance and will require careful thought in laying out the necessary relationships!

**Exploring residue conditions for N and M**

I'm considering the implications of N not being a subset of ℓ0Z. If I add T with first coordinates as multiples of ℓ0, the outcome will yield non-uniform residues mod ℓ0, complicating my plan to separate columns by those residues.

An alternate approach might be to duplicate the tile across the ℓ0-phase or to define a new A with N' including a shift by some S. I need to ensure that when I choose n_i and arcs I_i, both the α' and α=0 conditions result in disjoint arcs covering S^1. 

The key challenge is balancing the geometry for both scenarios within the limited choices for a_i. If I can't maintain both partitions, I risk losing coverage—so it's crucial to examine my choices carefully!

**Clarifying conditions for sets X and Y**

To restrict T1 so it covers exactly X columns, I need to set M as the intersection of (X − n_i). For T2, it's similar with M' based on Y. I must ensure that for every r in X, the expression r − n_i is part of M. This reinforces that r must also belong to an intersection condition regarding the shifts. 

However, if all n_i share a congruence mod ℓ0, we maintain the necessary conditions across sets. By keeping n_i as multiples of ℓ0, I can ensure proper separation between X and Y and retain my proof structure!

**Finalizing proof structure**

In Step 2 for α=0, I'm just looking at relationships stemming from the t_i α' expansions. By specifying that t1 and t2 are congruent to t3 mod ℓ0, I find that this doesn't disrupt Step 2's derivation. The resulting relationships still hold regardless of ℓ0, meaning I can adjust my choices of t_i yet maintain distinct fractional parts.

So, I can finalize my construction with proper selections for t1, t2, t3 to ensure n2 and n3 are multiples of ℓ0 while still keeping the essential properties intact!
