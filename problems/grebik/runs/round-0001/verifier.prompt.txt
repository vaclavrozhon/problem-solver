=== SYSTEM ===
You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md, proofs.md, and output.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers
- notes.md (informal progress & exploratory work so far)
- proofs.md (rigorous proofs & detailed mathematics so far)
- output.md (main results summary so far)

**Three-tier file system guidelines**:
- **notes.md**: Readable running log of exploratory work, intuitions, failed attempts, ideas. Prefer appending. Replace only if old notes are clearly misleading. Should be self-contained.
- **proofs.md**: Complete rigorous mathematical proofs with full details. Contains proven lemmas, theorems, and detailed derivations. Only add mathematically verified content here.
- **output.md**: ONLY the main problem results. Think twice before adding anything. Should contain a concise summary of the most important theorems that directly advance the main problem. Extremely selective.

Tasks:
1) Audit rigor: identify unjustified steps, false statements, missing lemmas; produce minimal counterexamples.
2) Triage value: separate genuine progress from noise.
3) Guide next steps: propose what provers should try next.

A paper with a certain tiling result is attached below; we want to improve it. We are still interested in translational tilings with one tile in the space $\mathbb{Z}\times S^1$, where $\mathbb{Z}$ are integers and $S^1$ is the unit circle.
A tile A is a finite union of intervals, that is a set of the form  $A=\bigcup_{i=1}^\ell \{k_i\}\times [a_i,b_i]$, kde indexy $k_i$ se mohou opakovat.
Tiling je mnozina $T\subseteq Z \times S^1$, takova, ze $A+T=Z\times S^1$ a pro $t\not=t'$ je $(A+t)\cap (A+t')$ miry nula.
Dale rekneme, ze $A$ je column, pokud $A$ tiluje množinu $\{n_1,\dots, n_m\}\times S^1$.

After a trivial modification (namely gluing both tilings together by working in $2\mathbb{Z}$), the example in that paper shows that there is a tile $A$ that is not a column together with a tiling $T$ such that we can write $\mathbb{Z}=X\sqcup Y$ and $T=T_1\sqcup T_2$ such that
\begin{itemize}
    \item both $X$ and $Y$ are periodic for some $\ell\in \mathbb{Z}\setminus \{0\}$,
    \item $A+T_1=X\times S^1$ and $A+T_2=Y\times S^1$ 
    \item $T_1$ is $(\ell_1,0)$-periodic and $T_2$ is $(\ell_2,\alpha')$-periodic, where $\alpha'$ is irrational.
\end{itemize}
In the modification of that example, we have that $X=2\mathbb{Z}$ and $Y=2\mathbb{Z}+1$.

My question is if there is a tile $A$ and a tiling $T$ that satisfies everything as above with the additional property that $X$ nor $Y$ tile $\mathbb{Z}$ (in the sense that there are not finitely many disjoint translates of say $X$ that disjointly cover $\mathbb{Z}$, and the same for $Y$).



Here comes the paper.

\title{A non-column tile in $\Z\times \Sone$ with periods $\alpha=0$ and $\alpha'\notin\mathbb{Q}$}
\author{}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\paragraph{Group and measure.}
Let $G=\Z\times \Sone$ with addition $(m,\theta)+(n,\varphi)=(m+n,\theta+\varphi \bmod 1)$.
On $\Z$ we use counting measure and on $\Sone=\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ we use normalized Lebesgue measure~$\mu$;
products and equalities are always understood almost everywhere (a.e.).
Half-open arcs are used to avoid boundary issues.

\paragraph{Tiles and single-coset sets.}
A \emph{tile} is a measurable finite union of columns
\[
A=\bigcup_{i=1}^{\ell} \{n_i\}\times I_i,\qquad n_i\in\Z,\ I_i\subset \Sone \text{ half-open intervals.}
\]
For $\alpha\in[0,1)$ and $c\in \Sone$ put
\[
T_{\alpha,c}:=\{(n,n\alpha+c):n\in\Z\}.
\]
We say that $A$ \emph{tiles $G$ with} $T\subset G$ if $A+T=G$ a.e.\ and the overlaps $(A+t)\cap (A+t')$ have measure zero whenever $t\neq t'$.

\paragraph{Columns.}
We call $A$ a \emph{column} if there exist finite sets $C\subset \Z$ and $\Lambda\subset \Sone$ such that
$A\subset C\times \Sone$ and the family $\{A+(0,\lambda):\lambda\in\Lambda\}$ is pairwise a.e.\ disjoint with
\begin{equation}\label{eq:column-tiling}
\bigcup_{\lambda\in\Lambda}\bigl(A+(0,\lambda)\bigr)=C\times \Sone\quad\text{a.e.}
\end{equation}
(That is, vertical translates by the finite set $\Lambda$ tile the finitely many columns $C$.)

\section{A single-coset criterion and a column obstruction}
\begin{lemma}[single-coset criterion]\label{lem:singlecoset}
Let $A=\bigcup_{i=1}^{\ell} \{n_i\}\times I_i$ and for $\alpha\in[0,1)$ define
\[
S(\alpha):=\bigcup_{i=1}^{\ell} (I_i-n_i\alpha)\subset \Sone.
\]
Then $A+T_{\alpha,c}$ tiles $G$ a.e.\ (for some/every $c$) if and only if the family $\{I_i-n_i\alpha\}_{i=1}^{\ell}$ is pairwise a.e.\ disjoint and $S(\alpha)=\Sone$ a.e.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Fix $r\in\Z$.
Points in $A+T_{\alpha,c}$ with first coordinate $r$ arise by translating $(n_i,\theta)\in A$ by $(r-n_i,(r-n_i)\alpha+c)$, hence the fiber over $r$ equals
\begin{align*}
\bigcup_{i=1}^{\ell}\bigl(I_i+(r-n_i)\alpha+c\bigr)
&= c+r\alpha+\bigcup_{i=1}^{\ell}(I_i-n_i\alpha)\\
&= c+r\alpha+S(\alpha).
\end{align*}
Therefore coverage and disjointness inside the $r$-th column are equivalent to $S(\alpha)=\Sone$ a.e.\ and pairwise a.e.\ disjointness of $\{I_i-n_i\alpha\}$.
Different columns live in disjoint fibers (different first coordinates), so there are no cross-column overlaps.
Since $c$ enters only as a common shift of the fiber, the condition is independent of~$c$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[column obstruction]\label{lem:column-obstruction}
Suppose $A\subset C\times \Sone$ for a finite $C\subset\Z$ and there exists a finite $\Lambda\subset\Sone$ such that
\eqref{eq:column-tiling} holds with pairwise a.e.\ disjoint translates.
Let $A_k:=\{\theta\in\Sone:(k,\theta)\in A\}$.
Then $\mu(A_k)=1/|\Lambda|$ for every $k\in C$.
In particular, if two nonempty column slices of $A$ have different measures, then $A$ is not a column.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Fix $k\in C$. By assumption, for a.e.\ $\theta\in\Sone$ we have
$\sum_{\lambda\in\Lambda} \1_{A_k}(\theta-\lambda)=1$.
Integrating and using translation invariance of $\mu$ gives
$|\Lambda|\cdot \mu(A_k)=1$, as claimed.
\end{proof}

\section{A non-column tile with periods $0$ and an irrational $\alpha'$}
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:main}
Let $\alpha'\in[0,1)$ be irrational.
Then there exists a measurable $A\subset \Z\times \Sone$ supported on three columns that is not a column, yet both $A+T_{0,0}$ and $A+T_{\alpha',0}$ tile $G$ a.e.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
\emph{Parameter choice.}
By density of $\{n\alpha'\bmod 1:n\in\Z\}$, choose distinct $t_1,t_2,t_3\in\Z$ so that the fractional parts
\[
b_i:=\{t_i\alpha'\}\in[0,1)\quad (i=1,2,3)
\]
are pairwise distinct; after relabeling assume $0\le b_1<b_2<b_3<1$.
Set
\[
L_1:=b_2-b_1,\qquad L_2:=b_3-b_2,\qquad L_3:=1-(b_3-b_1),
\]
so $L_1,L_2,L_3>0$ and $L_1+L_2+L_3=1$.
Define
\[
n_1:=0,\qquad n_2:=t_1-t_3,\qquad n_3:=t_2-t_3,
\]
and put
\[
a_i:= b_i+n_i\alpha'\ (\bmod 1),\qquad I_i:=[a_i,a_i+L_i)\subset \Sone.
\]
Let $A:=\{n_1\}\times I_1\ \cup\ \{n_2\}\times I_2\ \cup\ \{n_3\}\times I_3$.

\smallskip
\emph{Step 1 (period $\alpha'$).}
For $\alpha=\alpha'$, Lemma~\ref{lem:singlecoset} gives
\[
I_i-n_i\alpha'=[\,b_i,\ b_i+L_i\,),\quad i=1,2,3,
\]
which are exactly the three consecutive arcs $[b_1,b_2)$, $[b_2,b_3)$, and $[b_3,b_1)$ forming a partition of $\Sone$ (a.e.).
Hence $A+T_{\alpha',0}$ tiles $G$ a.e.

\smallskip
\emph{Step 2 (period $\alpha=0$).}
Write $t_i\alpha'=q_i+b_i$ with $q_i\in\Z$.
Then, modulo $1$,
\begin{align*}
a_1 &\equiv b_1,\\
a_3 &= b_3+(t_2-t_3)\alpha' \equiv b_3+(q_2+b_2-q_3-b_3)\equiv b_2,\\
a_2 &= b_2+(t_1-t_3)\alpha' \equiv b_2+(q_1+b_1-q_3-b_3)\equiv b_1-(b_3-b_2).
\end{align*}
Set $z_1:=a_1\equiv b_1$, $z_3:=a_3\equiv b_2$, and $z_2:=a_2\equiv b_1-(b_3-b_2)$ (all modulo $1$).
The forward cyclic gaps are
\begin{align*}
z_3-z_1 &= L_1,\\
(z_2-z_3)\bmod 1 &= 1-(b_3-b_1)=L_3,\\
(z_1-z_2)\bmod 1 &= b_3-b_2=L_2.
\end{align*}
Therefore $I_1=[z_1,z_1+L_1)$, $I_3=[z_3,z_3+L_3)$, and $I_2=[z_2,z_2+L_2)$ are pairwise disjoint and their union has total length~$1$, hence covers $\Sone$ a.e.
By Lemma~\ref{lem:singlecoset}, $A+T_{0,0}$ tiles $G$ a.e.

\smallskip
\emph{Step 3 (not a column).}
The slice measures in the three occupied columns are $\mu(I_1)=L_1$, $\mu(I_2)=L_2$, $\mu(I_3)=L_3$.
Note that $L_1=b_2-b_1=\{(t_2-t_1)\alpha'\}$ and $L_2=b_3-b_2=\{(t_3-t_2)\alpha'\}$ are fractional parts of nonzero integer multiples of the irrational $\alpha'$, hence $L_1$ and $L_2$ are irrational.
If $L_1=L_2$, then $L_3=1-2L_1\neq L_1$ (since $L_1=1/3$ would be rational).
Thus not all nonempty slice measures are equal.
By Lemma~\ref{lem:column-obstruction}, $A$ cannot be a column.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}[Fully explicit numbers]\label{rem:explicit}
For concreteness, take $\alpha'=\sqrt{2}/12$, $t_1=0$, $t_2=1$, $t_3=3$.
Then $b_1=0$, $b_2=\alpha'$, $b_3\equiv 3\alpha'$ (here $3\alpha'<1$), and
$L_1=\alpha'$, $L_2=2\alpha'$, $L_3=1-3\alpha'$ are distinct.
With $n_1=0$, $n_2=t_1-t_3=-3$, $n_3=t_2-t_3=-2$, the verification in Steps~1--2 applies verbatim.
\end{remark}

\paragraph{Conclusion.}
For every irrational $\alpha'\in[0,1)$ there exists a measurable $A\subset \Z\times\Sone$ that is not a column and tiles $G$ both with period $(1,0)$ and with period $(1,\alpha')$.

Ideas.
- Replace the 2Z gluing by gluing along an arbitrary modulus ℓ≥5, and force the three column indices of A to be all equal modulo ℓ. Then each column r uses only translates whose first coordinates lie in the single congruence class r mod ℓ, so we can independently decide, residue-by-residue, whether that column is filled by the α=0 tiling or by the α′ tiling.
- Choose ℓ and the residue set R⊂Z/ℓZ so that neither R nor its complement tiles Z by finitely many disjoint translates (density obstruction).

Key lemmas (with one-line “why useful here”).
1) Gluing-by-mod-ℓ lemma. Suppose A=⋃_{i=1}^ℓ {n_i}×I_i is a tile such that both S(0)=⋃ I_i and S(α′)=⋃(I_i−n_iα′) equal S^1 a.e. and the families are pairwise a.e. disjoint. If n_i≡n_0 (mod ℓ) for all i, then for any partition Z= X⊔Y into unions of residue classes modulo ℓ,
   T_1:= {(m,c_1): m∈X},  T_2:= {(m,mα′+c_2): m∈Y}
   yield a tiling A+(T_1∪T_2)=Z×S^1 a.e., with A+T_1=X×S^1 and A+T_2=Y×S^1.
   Why useful: this implements the desired X/Y split with periods in the first coordinate.
   Proof sketch. For column r, m=r−n_i≡r−n_0 (mod ℓ) is independent of i. If r∈X then m∈X for every i, so T_1 supplies all needed fibers and T_2 supplies none; coverage and disjointness in that column follow from S(0)=S^1 and the disjointness of {I_i}. If r∈Y, the same holds with α′ and S(α′). Different columns are disjoint.

2) Periodicity. With X, Y unions of residue classes mod ℓ, T_1 is (ℓ,0)-periodic and T_2 is (ℓ,ℓα′)-periodic (i.e. invariant under addition by these vectors). Why useful: matches the “periodic” requirement; note the slope α′ is preserved.

3) Non-tilability of periodic subsets. Let X be periodic mod ℓ with residue set R of size |R|. If X tiles Z by finitely many disjoint translates, then |R| divides ℓ (density argument: density(X)=|R|/ℓ, disjoint k-translates force k|R|/ℓ=1). Consequently, if 2≤|R|≤ℓ−2 and ℓ is prime, neither X nor its complement Y tiles Z by finitely many disjoint translates. Why useful: gives the extra property requested.

Construction (general). Fix an irrational α′. Choose a prime ℓ≥5. Pick three integers t_1,t_2,t_3 all congruent modulo ℓ and with distinct fractional parts b_i={t_iα′}; this is possible since {r+pℓ}α′ runs densely mod 1. Relabel so 0≤b_1<b_2<b_3<1 and set
- L_1:=b_2−b_1, L_2:=b_3−b_2, L_3:=1−(b_3−b_1),
- n_1:=0, n_2:=t_1−t_3, n_3:=t_2−t_3 (note n_j are multiples of ℓ),
- a_i:=b_i+n_iα′ (mod 1), I_i:=[a_i,a_i+L_i), and A:=⋃_{i=1}^3 {n_i}×I_i.
By the paper’s Lemma 2.1 and Theorem 3.1 (steps 1 and 2 therein), S(α′)=S^1 and S(0)=S^1 a.e., with pairwise a.e. disjointness in both families; hence A+T_{α′,c} and A+T_{0,c} each tile G. Moreover, since L_1={ (t_2−t_1)α′} and L_2={ (t_3−t_2)α′} are both irrational, we do not have all slice measures equal; in particular, taking t_2−t_1=t_3−t_2=ℓ gives L_1=L_2 irr., L_3=1−2L_1≠L_1, so A is not a column by the column obstruction lemma in the paper.

Now choose a nontrivial residue set R⊂Z/ℓZ with 2≤|R|≤ℓ−2 (e.g., ℓ=5 and R={0,2}). Put
- X:= {n∈Z: n (mod ℓ)∈R},
- Y:=Z\X,
- T_1:= {(m,c_1): m∈X},
- T_2:= {(m,mα′+c_2): m∈Y}.
By Lemma 1, A+(T_1∪T_2) tiles Z×S^1 a.e., with A+T_1=X×S^1 and A+T_2=Y×S^1. By Lemma 2, T_1 is (ℓ,0)-periodic and T_2 is (ℓ,ℓα′)-periodic. By Lemma 3 (with ℓ prime and 2≤|R|≤ℓ−2), neither X nor Y tiles Z by finitely many disjoint translates.

Fully explicit instance. Take α′=√2/12, ℓ=5, t_1=0, t_2=5, t_3=10 (these are congruent mod 5 and give distinct fractional parts). Build A as above. Let R={0,2}, hence X=5Z∪(5Z+2), Y=(5Z+1)∪(5Z+3)∪(5Z+4). Then T_1={(m,c_1): m≡0,2 (mod 5)} and T_2={(m,mα′+c_2): m≡1,3,4 (mod 5)}. This satisfies all bullets and neither X (density 2/5) nor Y (density 3/5) can tile Z disjointly.

Obstacles/notes.
- The statement “(ℓ_2,α′)-periodic” is best interpreted as “periodic in the first coordinate mod ℓ_2 along the α′-slope”, i.e., invariance under (ℓ_2,ℓ_2α′).
- The congruence n_i≡n_0 (mod ℓ) is essential to keep a whole column assigned to a single coset system.

Next steps.
- Formalize Lemma 1 (gluing-by-mod-ℓ) in proofs.md with full details.
- Add the explicit ℓ=5 instance to output.md, including a short density argument for non-tilability of X and Y.
