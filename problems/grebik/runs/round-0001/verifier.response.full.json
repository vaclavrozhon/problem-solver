Then, if X and Y are unions of residue classes mod \u2113 partitioning \u2124, exactly one of the two systems (\u03b1=0 or \u03b1=\u03b1\u2032) operates in column r according to whether r\u2208X or r\u2208Y.\\n\\nCorrections/clarifications.\\n- Gluing-by-mod-\u2113 lemma: as stated, \u201cif n_i\u2261n_0 (mod \u2113) then r\u2208X \u21d2 m\u2208X\u201d is not generally true unless X is chosen with residues shifted by \u2212n_0.

There exist a measurable tile A supported on three columns that is not a column, a partition \\\\Z=X\\\\sqcup Y into unions of residue classes modulo \u2113, and sets T_1,T_2 as above such that:\\n(a) A+(T_1\\\\sqcup T_2)=\\\\Z\\\\times \\\\Sone a.e., with A+T_1=X\\\\times \\\\Sone and A+T_2=Y\\\\times \\\\Sone;\\n(b) T_1 is (\u2113,0)-periodic and T_2 is (\u2113,\u2113\u03b1')-periodic;\\n(c) Neither X nor Y tiles \\\\Z by finitely many disjoint translates;\\n(d) A is not a column.\\nProof. Choose t_1,t_2,t_3 in arithmetic progression modulo \u2113, e.g. t_j=s+(j-1)\u2113 with s\\\\in\\\\Z; since \u03b1' is irrational, the fractional parts b_i=\\\\{t_i\u03b1'\\\\} are pairwise distinct. Construct A exactly as in the three-column construction (define L_i, a_i, I_i and n_1=0, n_2=t_1-t_3, n_3=t_2-t_3). Then the single-coset criterion shows A+T_{\u03b1',0} and A+T_{0,0} both tile G a.e., and n_i\\\\in\u2113\\\\Z for all i. Apply the gluing-by-mod-\u2113 lemma with any nontrivial residue set R with 2\\\\le |R|\\\\le \u2113-2, setting X from R and Y=\\\\Z\\\\setminus X; this yields (a)\u2013(b). By the non-tilability lemma and the primality of \u2113, (c) holds. Finally, the slice measures are L_1,L_2,L_3 with L_1+L_2+L_3=1 and, by irrationality of \u03b1', not all equal; hence A is not a column by the column-slice obstruction (if all nonempty slices had equal measure they would each equal 1/|\\\\Lambda|, impossible here). Remark: one can ensure L_1\\\\ne L_2 by taking t_2-t_1=t_3-t_2=\u2113, which forces L_1=L_2 to be irrational, hence L_3=1-2L_1\\\\ne L_1.\\n\\nRemark (explicit instance). Take \u03b1'=\\\\sqrt{2}/12, \u2113=5, and (t_1,t_2,t_3)=(0,10,5). Build A as above. Let R=\\\\{0,2\\\\}, so X=5\\\\Z\\\\cup(5\\\\Z+2), Y=(5\\\\Z+1)\\\\cup(5\\\\Z+3)\\\\cup(5\\\\Z+4). Then A+T_1=X\\\\times\\\\Sone, A+T_2=Y\\\\times\\\\Sone, T_1 is (5,0)-periodic, T_2 is (5,5\u03b1')-periodic, and neither X nor Y tiles \\\\Z by finitely many disjoint translates.\"},\"output_update\":{\"action\":\"append\",\"content\":\"Main new result. For every irrational \u03b1\u2032 and every prime \u2113\u22655 there exists a measurable tile A\u2282\u2124\u00d7S^1 supported on three columns that is not a column, and a tiling T=T_1\u2294T_2 with a partition \u2124=X\u2294Y into unions of residue classes mod \u2113 such that:\\n- A+T_1=X\u00d7S^1 and A+T_2=Y\u00d7S^1;\\n- T_1 is (\u2113,0)-periodic and T_2 is (\u2113,\u2113\u03b1\u2032)-periodic (i.e., invariant under addition by (\u2113,\u2113\u03b1\u2032));\\n- Neither X nor Y tiles \u2124 by finitely many disjoint translates (density obstruction: if X has |R| residues then k disjoint translates tile \u2124 iff k|R|=\u2113, impossible for 2\u2264|R|\u2264\u2113\u22122).\\n\\nThus the strengthened property asked in the question holds: one can realize the X/Y split with the two periods while ensuring that neither side tiles \u2124 on its own.\"}}",
