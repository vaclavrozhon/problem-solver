We validated and corrected the mod-ℓ gluing scheme: after translating so n_i≡0 (mod ℓ), define X,Y as unions of residue classes mod ℓ and take T_1={(m,c_1):m∈X}, T_2={(m,mα′+c_2):m∈Y}. Then A+(T_1∪T_2) tiles, with A+T_1=X×S^1 and A+T_2=Y×S^1; T_1 is (ℓ,0)-periodic, T_2 is (ℓ,ℓα′)-periodic. Choosing ℓ prime and 2≤|R|≤ℓ−2 ensures neither X nor Y tiles ℤ (density k|R|=ℓ obstruction). Minor fixes: require n_i≡0 (mod ℓ) or shift X by −n_0; clarify periodicity of T_2; adjust explicit numbers. We provide formal lemmas and a theorem establishing an affirmative answer to the question.
