{"feedback_md":"Your mod-ℓ gluing idea is on target and (after a small correction) gives an affirmative answer to the posed question. The key is to force all first-coordinate positions of A to lie in a single residue class modulo ℓ (conveniently 0), so that for each column r the three requisite translation parameters m=r−n_i fall in the same residue class as r. Then, if X and Y are unions of residue classes mod ℓ partitioning ℤ, exactly one of the two systems (α=0 or α=α′) operates in column r according to whether r∈X or r∈Y.\n\nCorrections/clarifications.\n- Gluing-by-mod-ℓ lemma: as stated, “if n_i≡n_0 (mod ℓ) then r∈X ⇒ m∈X” is not generally true unless X is chosen with residues shifted by −n_0. The clean version is: after translating A by (−n_0,0), assume n_i≡0 (mod ℓ) for all i; then m≡r (mod ℓ), so r∈X ⇔ m∈X. We encode this in the formal lemma below.\n- Periodicity notation: T_2={(m,mα′+c_2):m∈Y} is invariant under (ℓ,ℓα′), not under (ℓ,α′). Your parenthetical remark matches this; we will state periodicity as invariance under that vector.\n- Explicit instance: with α′=√2/12, ℓ=5, if you keep t_1=0,t_2=5,t_3=10 then b_3<b_2. This is harmless (we can relabel), but to match “0≤b_1<b_2<b_3<1” you can take (t_1,t_2,t_3)=(0,10,5), still all ≡0 (mod 5).\n\nSoundness of the construction. With the corrected lemma, the proof that A+(T_1∪T_2) tiles is straightforward: in column r∈X, the fiber equals c_1+⋃ I_i=S^1 a.e., and only T_1 contributes; in column r∈Y, the fiber equals c_2+rα′+⋃(I_i−n_iα′)=S^1 a.e., and only T_2 contributes. Disjointness across different t’s follows from pairwise disjointness of the relevant families and from separation of columns. The “A not a column” obstruction via unequal slice measures carries over unchanged from the paper.\n\nNon-tilability of X and Y. Your density argument is correct but can be sharpened: if X has residue set R⊂ℤ/ℓℤ, then k disjoint translates tile ℤ iff k|R|=ℓ. Thus for prime ℓ and 2≤|R|≤ℓ−2, neither X nor Y tiles ℤ by finitely many disjoint translates.\n\nNext steps.\n- Formalize (and use) the corrected gluing-by-mod-ℓ lemma in proofs.md.\n- Add the density/non-tilability lemma with a short proof by counting in one period.\n- State and prove the final theorem answering the question (choose prime ℓ≥5 and 2≤|R|≤ℓ−2), and include a fully explicit instance.\n- Align the periodicity statement for T_2 as invariance under (ℓ,ℓα′).","summary_md":"We validated and corrected the mod-ℓ gluing scheme: after translating so n_i≡0 (mod ℓ), define X,Y as unions of residue classes mod ℓ and take T_1={(m,c_1):m∈X}, T_2={(m,mα′+c_2):m∈Y}. Then A+(T_1∪T_2) tiles, with A+T_1=X×S^1 and A+T_2=Y×S^1; T_1 is (ℓ,0)-periodic, T_2 is (ℓ,ℓα′)-periodic. Choosing ℓ prime and 2≤|R|≤ℓ−2 ensures neither X nor Y tiles ℤ (density k|R|=ℓ obstruction).

Fix r\\in\\Z. For any i, the only translates contributing to the r-th column are those with first coordinate m=r-n_i. Since n_i\\inℓ\\Z, m\\equiv r (mod ℓ), independent of i. If r\\in X then all m=r-n_i lie in X, hence in T_1; none lie in Y, so T_2 contributes nothing to column r.

Distinct columns are disjoint, proving (i)–(ii).

Let ℓ\\ge 1 and R\\subset \\Z/ℓ\\Z with 1\\le r:=|R|\\le ℓ. Set X:=\\{n\\in\\Z: n\\bmod ℓ\\in R\\}. If k disjoint translates of X tile \\Z, then kr=ℓ. In particular, X tiles \\Z by finitely many disjoint translates iff r\\mid ℓ; when this holds, exactly k=ℓ/r translates are needed. The same holds for Y=\\Z\\setminus X, with residue count ℓ-r.\nProof. Work modulo ℓ: in a fundamental period of length ℓ, X occupies exactly r residue classes. Disjoint translates correspond to disjoint shifts of R in \\Z/ℓ\\Z, so their union has size at most kr. If these shifts cover all ℓ residues, then kr\\ge ℓ. Conversely, coverage of \\Z forces coverage of each period and hence kr\\le ℓ. Therefore kr=ℓ. The remaining statements follow immediately; a density proof gives the same conclusion: density(X)=r/ℓ, additivity of densities for disjoint unions yields k(r/ℓ)=1.\n\nTheorem (answer to the X/Y non-tilability question). Let α' be irrational and let ℓ be a prime with ℓ\\ge 5.

Choose t_1,t_2,t_3 in arithmetic progression modulo ℓ, e.g. t_j=s+(j-1)ℓ with s\\in\\Z; since α' is irrational, the fractional parts b_i=\\{t_iα'\\} are pairwise distinct. Construct A exactly as in the three-column construction (define L_i, a_i, I_i and n_1=0, n_2=t_1-t_3, n_3=t_2-t_3). Then the single-coset criterion shows A+T_{α',0} and A+T_{0,0} both tile G a.e., and n_i\\inℓ\\Z for all i. Apply the gluing-by-mod-ℓ lemma with any nontrivial residue set R with 2\\le |R|\\le ℓ-2, setting X from R and Y=\\Z\\setminus X; this yields (a)–(b). By the non-tilability lemma and the primality of ℓ, (c) holds. Finally, the slice measures are L_1,L_2,L_3 with L_1+L_2+L_3=1 and, by irrationality of α', not all equal; hence A is not a column by the column-slice obstruction (if all nonempty slices had equal measure they would each equal 1/|\\Lambda|, impossible here). Remark: one can ensure L_1\\ne L_2 by taking t_2-t_1=t_3-t_2=ℓ, which forces L_1=L_2 to be irrational, hence L_3=1-2L_1\\ne L_1.\n\nRemark (explicit instance).
