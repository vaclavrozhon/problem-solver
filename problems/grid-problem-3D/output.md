Main 3D result. For every U⊆[n]^3 with |U|≥2, G[U] contains an edge whose color under c_3 (type modulo global sign together with the full componentwise minimum) appears exactly once. Proof idea: Either a z-slice contains ≥2 points, so the d=2 theorem yields an in-slice uniquely colored edge that remains unique in 3D (c_3 records the equal coordinate and its value), or every z-slice has ≤1 point, and the edge between the top two z-levels has a uniquely determined z-entry in its lower corner, hence a unique color.
