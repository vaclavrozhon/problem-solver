# Main Results



Main 3D result. For every U⊆[n]^3 with |U|≥2, there exists an edge u1u2 in G[U] whose color under c3 (type modulo global sign together with the full componentwise minimum) appears exactly once in G[U]. The proof splits into: (i) apply the d=2 theorem on any coordinate slice containing ≥2 points (uniqueness lifts since c3 records the fixed coordinate), or (ii) in the coordinatewise-injective case, either a mixed-sign edge has multiplicity 1 by a product count, or U is a chain and a [+++]-type at the penultimate element is unique.
