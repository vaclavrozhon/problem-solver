# Problem definition and your task

Fix an integer $n\ge 1$ and let $[n]=\{1,2,\dots,n\}$. Consider the complete graph $G$ on the vertex set

$$
V(G)=[n]\times[n]\times[n].
$$

For two distinct vertices

$$
u=(x_1,y_1,z_1),\qquad v=(x_2,y_2,z_2),
$$

define the **sign pattern**

$$
\sigma(u,v)=\big(\operatorname{sgn}(x_1-x_2),\,\operatorname{sgn}(y_1-y_2),\,\operatorname{sgn}(z_1-z_2)\big)\in\{-1,0,+1\}^3\setminus\{(0,0,0)\}.
$$

The **type** of the undirected edge $e=uv$ is the equivalence class

$$
T(e)=[\sigma(u,v)]\quad\text{modulo global sign }(\sigma\sim -\sigma),
$$

so there are $(3^3-1)/2=13$ types. Let $J(T)\subseteq\{x,y,z\}$ be the coordinates where $T$ is nonzero, and $E(T)=\{x,y,z\}\setminus J(T)$ the coordinates where it is zero.

Define the **componentwise minimum** (the “lower corner”)

$$
\ell(u,v)=\bigl(\min\{x_1,x_2\},\,\min\{y_1,y_2\},\,\min\{z_1,z_2\}\bigr)\in[n]^3.
$$

Define the color map $c_3:E(G)\to\mathcal L$ by

$$
\boxed{\quad c_3(uv)\;=\;\bigl(T(e),\,\ell(u,v)\bigr). \quad}
$$

Equivalently (expanding $\ell$ along $J(T)$ and $E(T)$): for $i\in J(T)$ record $m_i:=\min\{u_i,v_i\}$, and for $i\in E(T)$ record $t_i:=u_i(=v_i)$; together these give the full vector $\ell(u,v)$.
**This explicitly remembers the coordinates that are equal**, fixing the issue where colors could otherwise forget them.

**Examples.**

$$
\begin{aligned}
c_3(uv) &=\bigl([+,+,+],\ \min\{x_1,x_2\},\ \min\{y_1,y_2\},\ \min\{z_1,z_2\}\bigr),\\
c_3(uv) &=\bigl([+,-,0],\ \min\{x_1,x_2\},\ \min\{y_1,y_2\},\ z_1\bigr)\quad\text{if }z_1=z_2,\\
c_3(uv) &=\bigl([+,0,0],\ \min\{x_1,x_2\},\ y_1,\ z_1\bigr)\quad\text{if }y_1=y_2,\ z_1=z_2.
\end{aligned}
$$

For $U\subseteq V(G)$, let $G[U]$ denote the induced subgraph. An edge $e\in E(G[U])$ has a **unique color in $U$** if no other edge of $G[U]$ has the same label $c_3(e)$.

# Your task

Show that for every vertex set $U\subseteq [n]^3$ with $|U|\ge 2$, there exist $u_1,u_2\in U$ such that the edge $u_1u_2$ has a color that appears **exactly once** in $G[U]$ under the coloring $c_3$ above.


You are given a file with a proof for $d=2$.

## Round 0001 — 2025-08-29T13:19:08.503942Z

# Progress Notes for Round 0001

## Ideas
To tackle the problem for the case where $d=3$, we need to extend the proof strategy used for $d=2$. The main focus will be on understanding how the color map $c_3$ behaves in three dimensions and how the types of edges can be categorized based on the sign patterns. We can utilize the combinatorial nature of the types and the minimum function to establish a unique coloring for edges in the induced subgraph.

## Lemmas from Literature
1. **Pigeonhole Principle**: If we have more edges than colors, at least one color must repeat. This principle will be useful in showing that if we have sufficiently many edges, some must be unique.
   - *Why useful here*: It establishes a baseline for uniqueness in edge colors based on the number of edges and the number of possible color types.

2. **Counting Arguments**: If we can count the number of edges of each type and relate this to the number of vertices, we can argue about the existence of unique edges.
   - *Why useful here*: Helps in establishing bounds on the number of edges that can share the same color.

## Examples
Consider a small example with $n=2$:
- Vertices: $V(G) = ig\{(1,1,1), (1,1,2), (1,2,1), (2,1,1), (2,2,2)\big\}$.
- Analyzing the edges, we can compute the colors using $c_3$ and check for uniqueness. For instance, the edge between $(1,1,1)$ and $(1,1,2)$ gives $c_3 = ([0,+,0], 1, 1, 1)$.
- By checking all pairs, we can see how many edges have the same color and identify unique cases.

## Obstacles
A potential obstacle is the complexity of the sign patterns in three dimensions. The interactions between the coordinates could lead to a larger number of edge types than anticipated, complicating the counting argument. We need to ensure that we can systematically account for all possible cases of edge types.

## Next Steps
1. **Extend the proof for $d=3$**: Build on the existing proof for $d=2$ and adapt it to handle the additional dimension. Focus on how the sign patterns interact in this higher-dimensional space.
2. **Conduct further examples**: Test more combinations of vertices to see how the colors distribute and to identify unique edge colors systematically.
3. **Explore combinatorial bounds**: Investigate how the number of vertices and edges can be related to ensure that unique colors exist.

## Gaps in output.md
- The proof for $d=2$ might not directly translate to $d=3$. We need to explicitly state how the counting changes and how we can ensure uniqueness in three dimensions. This needs to be addressed in the output for completeness.

## Round 0001 — 2025-08-29T13:20:54.421017Z

# Progress Notes for Round 0002

## Ideas
To further develop the proof for the case where $d=3$, we need to focus on how the color map $c_3$ behaves specifically in three dimensions. A key aspect will be to analyze the interactions between the sign patterns and how they contribute to the uniqueness of edge colors in the induced subgraph. We can categorize edges based on their types and systematically explore the implications of these types on the edge color distribution.

## Lemmas from Literature
1. **Pigeonhole Principle**: This principle remains crucial as it provides a foundational argument for the uniqueness of edge colors when the number of edges exceeds the number of distinct color types. We should explicitly quantify the number of edges in $G[U]$ and compare it to the number of possible color types.
   - *Why useful here*: It helps to establish that with enough edges, at least one must be unique.

2. **Counting Arguments**: We need to refine our counting strategy to account for the increased complexity in three dimensions. Specifically, we should calculate the number of edges for each type and relate this to the number of vertices in $U$. This will help us argue about the existence of unique edges more robustly.
   - *Why useful here*: It provides a systematic method to analyze edge color distributions and uniqueness.

## Examples
Let's extend our previous example with $n=2$:
- Vertices: $V(G) = \{(1,1,1), (1,1,2), (1,2,1), (2,1,1), (2,2,2)\}$.
- We will compute the colors using $c_3$ for all pairs of vertices and check for the uniqueness of colors systematically. For instance, we should analyze pairs like $(1,1,1)$ and $(1,2,1)$, and compute their colors. This will help us identify unique cases more clearly.

## Obstacles
One major obstacle is the increased number of edge types in three dimensions due to the sign patterns. We need to ensure that our counting arguments can handle this complexity. A systematic approach to categorize and count edge types will be essential to overcome this challenge.

## Next Steps
1. **Extend the proof for $d=3$**: Begin drafting a proof by explicitly stating how the counting changes when moving from $d=2$ to $d=3$. We should focus on the implications of the additional dimension on the edge types and their uniqueness.
2. **Conduct further examples**: Test more combinations of vertices, particularly focusing on edges that may have unique colors. This empirical exploration will help validate our theoretical claims.
3. **Explore combinatorial bounds**: Investigate how the number of vertices and edges can be related to ensure that unique colors exist. This may involve more detailed combinatorial arguments.

## Gaps in output.md
- The output for $d=2$ does not provide a clear transition to $d=3$. We need to explicitly outline how the counting of edge types changes and how we can ensure uniqueness in three dimensions. This gap needs to be addressed for completeness in the proof.

## Round 0001 — 2025-08-29T13:20:54.727889Z

# Progress Notes for Round 0002

## Ideas
To further develop the proof for the case where $d=3$, we need to delve deeper into the implications of the edge types defined by the sign patterns. Specifically, we should categorize the edges based on their types and analyze how many edges can share the same type. This will help in establishing a framework to demonstrate that at least one edge must have a unique color in the induced subgraph $G[U]$.

## Lemmas from Literature
1. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**: This principle can be useful in counting the number of edges that share the same color and distinguishing unique cases.
   - *Why useful here*: It allows us to systematically account for overlaps in edge types and colors, which is crucial for proving uniqueness.

2. **Combinatorial Bounds**: We can leverage known results in combinatorial geometry regarding the distribution of points in higher dimensions to argue about the density of edges and their colors.
   - *Why useful here*: It helps in establishing a relationship between the number of vertices, edges, and the types of colors they can generate.

## Examples
Consider a small example with $n=3$:
- Vertices: $V(G) = \{(1,1,1), (1,1,2), (1,2,1), (2,1,1), (2,2,2), (3,3,3)\}$.
- Analyzing the edges, we can compute the colors using $c_3$ for various pairs. For instance, the edge between $(1,1,1)$ and $(1,1,2)$ gives $c_3 = ([0,+,0], 1, 1, 1)$, while the edge between $(1,2,1)$ and $(2,1,1)$ gives $c_3 = ([+,-,0], 1, 1, 1)$. By systematically checking all pairs, we can identify how many edges have the same color and pinpoint unique cases.

## Obstacles
A significant obstacle remains the complexity of the sign patterns in three dimensions. As we categorize edges based on their types, we need to ensure that we do not overlook any combinations that could lead to shared colors. Additionally, the potential increase in the number of edge types may complicate the counting argument further.

## Next Steps
1. **Extend the proof for $d=3$**: Develop a systematic approach to categorize and count edge types based on their sign patterns. This should include a detailed analysis of how many edges can share the same color.
2. **Conduct further examples**: Test more combinations of vertices, particularly focusing on edge pairs that may yield unique colors. This will help in validating our counting arguments.
3. **Explore combinatorial bounds**: Investigate how the number of vertices and edges can be related to ensure that unique colors exist, potentially using the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle.

## Gaps in output.md
- The proof for $d=2$ does not provide a clear transition to $d=3$. We need to explicitly state how the counting changes and how we can ensure uniqueness in three dimensions. Additionally, the examples provided in the earlier round need to be expanded with more detailed calculations to strengthen the argument for uniqueness.

## round-0001 — model summary — 2025-08-29T13:19:32.149562Z
In this round, the focus was on extending the proof strategy from $d=2$ to $d=3$. Key ideas included analyzing the behavior of the color map $c_3$ in three dimensions and categorizing edges based on sign patterns. The Pigeonhole Principle and counting arguments were identified as useful tools for establishing uniqueness in edge colors. A small example with $n=2$ was explored to illustrate the color distribution and uniqueness of edges. However, challenges remain due to the complexity of sign patterns in three dimensions, necessitating a systematic approach to account for all edge types. The next steps involve extending the proof for $d=3$, conducting further examples, and exploring combinatorial bounds.

## round-0001 — model summary — 2025-08-29T13:21:17.954012Z

=== round-0001/verifier.feedback.md ===
The prover reports present a coherent strategy for extending the proof from the case where $d=2$ to $d=3$. Both provers emphasize the importance of categorizing edges based on their types defined by sign patterns, which is crucial for establishing uniqueness in edge colors. The use of the Pigeonhole Principle and Counting Arguments is well-founded, as these are standard techniques in combinatorial proofs. However, both reports highlight a significant gap in the transition from $d=2$ to $d=3$, indicating that the existing proof lacks clarity on how the counting of edge types changes with the additional dimension. This is a critical point that needs to be addressed in the next round of work. 

The obstacles mentioned, particularly the complexity of sign patterns in three dimensions, are valid concerns. Provers should focus on developing a systematic approach to categorize and count edge types, ensuring that no combinations leading to shared colors are overlooked. The suggestion to use the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle is promising and could enhance the rigor of the counting arguments. 

Next steps should include: 1) Drafting a detailed proof for $d=3$ that explicitly outlines the changes in counting edge types and how this impacts uniqueness; 2) Conducting further examples with a focus on identifying unique edge colors; 3) Exploring combinatorial bounds more thoroughly to establish relationships between the number of vertices, edges, and color types. These steps will help solidify the theoretical framework and provide a clearer path towards proving the desired results for $d=3$. 

Overall, while the reports do not present fully rigorous results suitable for output.md, they do indicate a clear direction for future work, making this a partial success.
