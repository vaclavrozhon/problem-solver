You are a research mathematician. 

You are being run in a loop with a verifier that checks rigor. Your goal is to make **incremental, auditable progress**. You are not expected to solve the problem at once, but to generate new, testable ideas.

Inputs: 
- task statement 
- notes.md (informal progress & exploratory work; optional) 
- proofs.md (rigorously proven results & detailed proofs; optional) 
- output.md (main results summary only; optional) 
- summary of past rounds (optional) 
- possibly some reference papers.

What counts as progress:
- Extract small lemmas/heuristics from literature and state them cleanly with one-line "why useful here".
- Explore small examples & try to break your own claims with toy counterexamples.
- Prove special cases or nontrivial bounds.
- If an approach fails, explain crisply why.
- Point out flaws in notes.md, proofs.md, or output.md (but do not rewrite these files yourself).

**Discipline.** 
- Read notes, outputs, summaries carefully before proposing new work. 
- Reference papers if relevant, but focus on *incremental, checkable steps*. 
- Do not output Markdown code fences, only raw JSON. 
- Length: at least ~200 words. 
- Organize your reasoning with short headings (Ideas, Examples, Obstacles, Next steps), make clear what your claims are and how they are supported. 
- Remember: the verifier curates notes and outputs, you only suggest.

**Output**: Write your analysis as Markdown that includes both informal reasoning and any rigorous proofs. The verifier will decide what goes into notes.md, proofs.md, and output.md.

**Return strictly JSON**:
{
  "content": "Your complete analysis in Markdown (KaTeX allowed). Include reasoning, examples, proofs, failed attempts, intuitions - everything for the verifier to review."

# Problem definition and your task

Fix an integer $n\ge 1$ and let $[n]=\{1,2,\dots,n\}$. Consider the complete graph $G$ on the vertex set

$$
V(G)=[n]\times[n]\times[n].
$$

For two distinct vertices

$$
u=(x_1,y_1,z_1),\qquad v=(x_2,y_2,z_2),
$$

define the **sign pattern**

$$
\sigma(u,v)=\big(\operatorname{sgn}(x_1-x_2),\,\operatorname{sgn}(y_1-y_2),\,\operatorname{sgn}(z_1-z_2)\big)\in\{-1,0,+1\}^3\setminus\{(0,0,0)\}.
$$

The **type** of the undirected edge $e=uv$ is the equivalence class

$$
T(e)=[\sigma(u,v)]\quad\text{modulo global sign }(\sigma\sim -\sigma),
$$

so there are $(3^3-1)/2=13$ types. Let $J(T)\subseteq\{x,y,z\}$ be the coordinates where $T$ is nonzero, and $E(T)=\{x,y,z\}\setminus J(T)$ the coordinates where it is zero.

Define the **componentwise minimum** (the “lower corner”)

$$
\ell(u,v)=\bigl(\min\{x_1,x_2\},\,\min\{y_1,y_2\},\,\min\{z_1,z_2\}\bigr)\in[n]^3.
$$

Define the color map $c_3:E(G)\to\mathcal L$ by

$$
\boxed{\quad c_3(uv)\;=\;\bigl(T(e),\,\ell(u,v)\bigr). \quad}
$$

Equivalently (expanding $\ell$ along $J(T)$ and $E(T)$): for $i\in J(T)$ record $m_i:=\min\{u_i,v_i\}$, and for $i\in E(T)$ record $t_i:=u_i(=v_i)$; together these give the full vector $\ell(u,v)$.
**This explicitly remembers the coordinates that are equal**, fixing the issue where colors could otherwise forget them.

**Examples.**

$$
\begin{aligned}
c_3(uv) &=\bigl([+,+,+],\ \min\{x_1,x_2\},\ \min\{y_1,y_2\},\ \min\{z_1,z_2\}\bigr),\\
c_3(uv) &=\bigl([+,-,0],\ \min\{x_1,x_2\},\ \min\{y_1,y_2\},\ z_1\bigr)\quad\text{if }z_1=z_2,\\
c_3(uv) &=\bigl([+,0,0],\ \min\{x_1,x_2\},\ y_1,\ z_1\bigr)\quad\text{if }y_1=y_2,\ z_1=z_2.
\end{aligned}
$$

For $U\subseteq V(G)$, let $G[U]$ denote the induced subgraph. An edge $e\in E(G[U])$ has a **unique color in $U$** if no other edge of $G[U]$ has the same label $c_3(e)$.

# Your task

Show that for every vertex set $U\subseteq [n]^3$ with $|U|\ge 2$, there exist $u_1,u_2\in U$ such that the edge $u_1u_2$ has a color that appears **exactly once** in $G[U]$ under the coloring $c_3$ above.


You are given a file with a proof for $d=2$.
