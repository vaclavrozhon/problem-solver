If a fiber (say a z-level) contains at least two points, the d=2 theorem on that slice yields an edge whose 3D color is unique globally because the 3D color has z in E(T) with the exact level value recorded.\\n- If no fiber in any coordinate contains two points, then every pair of vertices differs in all three coordinates (E(T)=\\\\emptyset for every edge). Sort by z; take the top z-vertex and pair it with a suitable predecessor chosen by a Pareto-maximal criterion in (x,y). That edge\u2019s lower corner cannot be replicated, hence its color is unique.\\n\\nWhy useful: This directly reduces the 3D statement to the given d=2 result plus a clean combinatorial lemma for the \u201cgeneral position\u201d case.\\n\\n# Lemma 1 (Layer reduction)\\n\\nStatement. Let U\\\\subseteq[n]^3. If there exist c\\\\in\\\\{x,y,z\\\\} and t\\\\in[n] with |U\\\\cap\\\\{c=t\\\\}|\\\\ge 2, then G[U] contains an edge whose c_3-color appears exactly once in G[U].\\n\\nProof. WLOG c=z. Consider the 2D set U_t:=\\\\{(x,y):(x,y,t)\\\\in U\\\\}. By the d=2 theorem (for the coloring that records type and the 2D lower corner with equalities), G[U_t] has an edge e within the plane z=t whose 2D color is unique in that plane. Viewed in 3D, e has type with z\\\\in E(T) and its color c_3(e) records t in the z-slot of \\\\ell. Any edge not lying in the plane z=t either has z\\\\in J(T) (so cannot match type) or, if it lies in another plane z=t', then its color records t'\\\\ne t in the z-slot. Hence no edge outside z=t can share c_3(e). Uniqueness within z=t was ensured by the d=2 theorem, so c_3(e) is unique in G[U]. \u220e\\n\\n# Lemma 2 (General position: no equal coordinate anywhere)\\n\\nStatement. Let U\\\\subseteq[n]^3 be such that for any distinct u,v\\\\in U, u and v differ in all three coordinates (so every edge has J(T)=\\\\{x,y,z\\\\}). Then G[U] contains an edge whose c_3-color appears exactly once.\\n\\nProof. If |U|=2 the claim is trivial. Assume |U|=m\\\\ge 3. Order vertices by increasing z: v_1,\\\\dots,v_m with z_1<\\\\cdots<z_m.\\n\\nLet v_m be the top-z vertex, and among v_1,\\\\dots,v_{m-1} choose v_i with maximal x-coordinate (no ties exist since all x\u2019s are distinct).\\n\\nConsider the edge e=\\\\{v_i,v_m\\\\}. Since all coordinates differ on every pair, c_3(e) is determined by its lower corner \\\\ell(e)=\\\\bigl(\\\\min(x_i,x_m),\\\\min(y_i,y_m),z_i\\\\bigr) and the fixed type class with all three coordinates nonzero.\\n\\nWe claim c_3(e) is unique. First, among edges incident to v_m, the z-coordinate in \\\\ell uniquely identifies the lower endpoint: \\\\ell_z(e)=z_i, and distinct i give distinct z_i; hence no other \\\\{v_k,v_m\\\\} has the same color as e.\\n\\nNext, consider edges \\\\{v_a,v_b\\\\} with b<m. For such a pair to share c_3(e), we must have \\\\min(z_a,z_b)=z_i, i.e., a=i and b>i. Thus any potential duplicate must be \\\\{v_i,v_j\\\\} with i<j<m and satisfy simultaneously\\n\\n- \\\\min(x_i,x_j)=\\\\min(x_i,x_m), and\\n- \\\\min(y_i,y_j)=\\\\min(y_i,y_m).\\n\\nThere are two cases.\\n\\n1) If x_m<x_i (or analogously y_m<y_i), then \\\\min(x_i,x_m)=x_m. Any j<m has x_j\\\\ne x_m; since x_j\\\\in\\\\{1,\\\\dots,n\\\\}\\\\setminus\\\\{x_m\\\\}, \\\\min(x_i,x_j)=x_m cannot hold. Hence no \\\\{v_i,v_j\\\\}, j<m, matches e.\\n\\n2) If x_m>x_i and y_m>y_i, then \\\\min(x_i,x_m)=x_i and \\\\min(y_i,y_m)=y_i, so \\\\ell(e)=(x_i,y_i,z_i). For a duplicate \\\\{v_i,v_j\\\\} one needs x_j>x_i and y_j>y_i. But v_i was chosen with maximal x among j<m, so there is no j<m with x_j>x_i. Therefore no duplicate exists.\\n\\nThus in all cases c_3(e) is unique. \u220e\\n\\n# Theorem (d=3 uniqueness of a color)\\n\\nStatement. For every U\\\\subseteq[n]^3 with |U|\\\\ge 2, there exist u_1,u_2\\\\in U such that the edge u_1u_2 has a color that appears exactly once in G[U] under c_3.\\n\\nProof. If some coordinate fiber of U contains at least two points, apply Lemma 1. Otherwise, no two vertices of U share any coordinate, so Lemma 2 applies. \u220e\\n\\n# Examples / sanity checks\\n\\n- Two points differing in all coordinates: unique edge/color trivially.\\n- Three-point chain (in all coordinates): the top two form the unique color (only one pair has lower corner equal to the penultimate point).\\n- A nontrivial slice: If U contains two points with z=t, the unique edge from the d=2 result in that plane remains unique globally since z is recorded in the color and cross-plane edges have z\\\\in J(T).\\n\\n# Obstacles noted\\n\\n- Attempting to use a globally minimal lower corner \\\\ell among all edges fails: many color duplicates can share that \\\\ell via multiple pairs. This is why the layered reduction and the general-position Pareto argument are used.\\n\\n# Next steps / extensions\\n\\n- The same scheme generalizes to dimension d by induction on d: if some fiber has size \\\\ge 2, reduce to d-1; otherwise all coordinates are distinct, sort by the d-th coordinate, choose the top element and pair with a point that is Pareto-maximal in the remaining d-1 coordinates. The same uniqueness argument applies because the color records all coordinates of the lower corner and the type fixes J(T).\"\n}",
