# Ideas

- Slice by a fixed coordinate. If a fiber (say a z-level) contains at least two points, the d=2 theorem on that slice yields an edge whose 3D color is unique globally because the 3D color has z in E(T) with the exact level value recorded.
- If no fiber in any coordinate contains two points, then every pair of vertices differs in all three coordinates (E(T)=\emptyset for every edge). Sort by z; take the top z-vertex and pair it with a suitable predecessor chosen by a Pareto-maximal criterion in (x,y). That edge’s lower corner cannot be replicated, hence its color is unique.

Why useful: This directly reduces the 3D statement to the given d=2 result plus a clean combinatorial lemma for the “general position” case.

# Lemma 1 (Layer reduction)

Statement. Let U\subseteq[n]^3. If there exist c\in\{x,y,z\} and t\in[n] with |U\cap\{c=t\}|\ge 2, then G[U] contains an edge whose c_3-color appears exactly once in G[U].

Proof. WLOG c=z. Consider the 2D set U_t:=\{(x,y):(x,y,t)\in U\}. By the d=2 theorem (for the coloring that records type and the 2D lower corner with equalities), G[U_t] has an edge e within the plane z=t whose 2D color is unique in that plane. Viewed in 3D, e has type with z\in E(T) and its color c_3(e) records t in the z-slot of \ell. Any edge not lying in the plane z=t either has z\in J(T) (so cannot match type) or, if it lies in another plane z=t', then its color records t'\ne t in the z-slot. Hence no edge outside z=t can share c_3(e). Uniqueness within z=t was ensured by the d=2 theorem, so c_3(e) is unique in G[U]. ∎

# Lemma 2 (General position: no equal coordinate anywhere)

Statement. Let U\subseteq[n]^3 be such that for any distinct u,v\in U, u and v differ in all three coordinates (so every edge has J(T)=\{x,y,z\}). Then G[U] contains an edge whose c_3-color appears exactly once.

Proof. If |U|=2 the claim is trivial. Assume |U|=m\ge 3. Order vertices by increasing z: v_1,\dots,v_m with z_1<\cdots<z_m.

Let v_m be the top-z vertex, and among v_1,\dots,v_{m-1} choose v_i with maximal x-coordinate (no ties exist since all x’s are distinct).

Consider the edge e=\{v_i,v_m\}. Since all coordinates differ on every pair, c_3(e) is determined by its lower corner \ell(e)=\bigl(\min(x_i,x_m),\min(y_i,y_m),z_i\bigr) and the fixed type class with all three coordinates nonzero.

We claim c_3(e) is unique. First, among edges incident to v_m, the z-coordinate in \ell uniquely identifies the lower endpoint: \ell_z(e)=z_i, and distinct i give distinct z_i; hence no other \{v_k,v_m\} has the same color as e.

Next, consider edges \{v_a,v_b\} with b<m. For such a pair to share c_3(e), we must have \min(z_a,z_b)=z_i, i.e., a=i and b>i. Thus any potential duplicate must be \{v_i,v_j\} with i<j<m and satisfy simultaneously

- \min(x_i,x_j)=\min(x_i,x_m), and
- \min(y_i,y_j)=\min(y_i,y_m).

There are two cases.

1) If x_m<x_i (or analogously y_m<y_i), then \min(x_i,x_m)=x_m. Any j<m has x_j\ne x_m; since x_j\in\{1,\dots,n\}\setminus\{x_m\}, \min(x_i,x_j)=x_m cannot hold. Hence no \{v_i,v_j\}, j<m, matches e.

2) If x_m>x_i and y_m>y_i, then \min(x_i,x_m)=x_i and \min(y_i,y_m)=y_i, so \ell(e)=(x_i,y_i,z_i). For a duplicate \{v_i,v_j\} one needs x_j>x_i and y_j>y_i. But v_i was chosen with maximal x among j<m, so there is no j<m with x_j>x_i. Therefore no duplicate exists.

Thus in all cases c_3(e) is unique. ∎

# Theorem (d=3 uniqueness of a color)

Statement. For every U\subseteq[n]^3 with |U|\ge 2, there exist u_1,u_2\in U such that the edge u_1u_2 has a color that appears exactly once in G[U] under c_3.

Proof. If some coordinate fiber of U contains at least two points, apply Lemma 1. Otherwise, no two vertices of U share any coordinate, so Lemma 2 applies. ∎

# Examples / sanity checks

- Two points differing in all coordinates: unique edge/color trivially.
- Three-point chain (in all coordinates): the top two form the unique color (only one pair has lower corner equal to the penultimate point).
- A nontrivial slice: If U contains two points with z=t, the unique edge from the d=2 result in that plane remains unique globally since z is recorded in the color and cross-plane edges have z\in J(T).

# Obstacles noted

- Attempting to use a globally minimal lower corner \ell among all edges fails: many color duplicates can share that \ell via multiple pairs. This is why the layered reduction and the general-position Pareto argument are used.

# Next steps / extensions

- The same scheme generalizes to dimension d by induction on d: if some fiber has size \ge 2, reduce to d-1; otherwise all coordinates are distinct, sort by the d-th coordinate, choose the top element and pair with a point that is Pareto-maximal in the remaining d-1 coordinates. The same uniqueness argument applies because the color records all coordinates of the lower corner and the type fixes J(T).
