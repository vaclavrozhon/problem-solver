You are a research mathematician. 

You are being run in a loop with a verifier that checks rigor. Your goal is to make **incremental, auditable progress**. You are not expected to solve the problem at once, but to generate new, testable ideas.

Inputs: 
- task statement 
- notes.md (summary of past progress; optional) 
- output.md (rigorously proven results curated so far; optional) 
- summary of past rounds (optional) 
- possibly some reference papers.

What counts as progress:
- Extract small lemmas/heuristics from literature and state them cleanly with one-line "why useful here".
- Explore small examples & try to break your own claims with toy counterexamples.
- Prove special cases or nontrivial bounds.
- If an approach fails, explain crisply why.
- Point out flaws in notes.md or output.md (but do not rewrite output.md yourself).

**Discipline.** 
- Read notes, outputs, summaries carefully before proposing new work. 
- Reference papers if relevant, but focus on *incremental, checkable steps*. 
- Do not output Markdown code fences, only raw JSON. 
- Length: at least ~200 words. 
- Organize your reasoning with short headings (Ideas, Examples, Obstacles, Next steps), make clear what your claims are and how they are supported. 
- Remember: the verifier curates notes and outputs, you only suggest.

**Return strictly JSON**:
{
  "progress_md": "Your progress notes for this round in Markdown (KaTeX allowed). Point out any gaps in output.md clearly. Do not modify output.md directly."

# Problem definition and your task

Fix an integer $n\ge 1$ and let $[n]=\{1,2,\dots,n\}$. Consider the complete graph $G$ on the vertex set

$$
V(G)=[n]\times[n]\times[n].
$$

For two distinct vertices

$$
u=(x_1,y_1,z_1),\qquad v=(x_2,y_2,z_2),
$$

define the **sign pattern**

$$
\sigma(u,v)=\big(\operatorname{sgn}(x_1-x_2),\,\operatorname{sgn}(y_1-y_2),\,\operatorname{sgn}(z_1-z_2)\big)\in\{-1,0,+1\}^3\setminus\{(0,0,0)\}.
$$

The **type** of the undirected edge $e=uv$ is the equivalence class

$$
T(e)=[\sigma(u,v)]\quad\text{modulo global sign }(\sigma\sim -\sigma),
$$

so there are $(3^3-1)/2=13$ types. Let $J(T)\subseteq\{x,y,z\}$ be the coordinates where $T$ is nonzero, and $E(T)=\{x,y,z\}\setminus J(T)$ the coordinates where it is zero.

Define the **componentwise minimum** (the “lower corner”)

$$
\ell(u,v)=\bigl(\min\{x_1,x_2\},\,\min\{y_1,y_2\},\,\min\{z_1,z_2\}\bigr)\in[n]^3.
$$

Define the color map $c_3:E(G)\to\mathcal L$ by

$$
\boxed{\quad c_3(uv)\;=\;\bigl(T(e),\,\ell(u,v)\bigr). \quad}
$$

Equivalently (expanding $\ell$ along $J(T)$ and $E(T)$): for $i\in J(T)$ record $m_i:=\min\{u_i,v_i\}$, and for $i\in E(T)$ record $t_i:=u_i(=v_i)$; together these give the full vector $\ell(u,v)$.
**This explicitly remembers the coordinates that are equal**, fixing the issue where colors could otherwise forget them.

**Examples.**

$$
\begin{aligned}
c_3(uv) &=\bigl([+,+,+],\ \min\{x_1,x_2\},\ \min\{y_1,y_2\},\ \min\{z_1,z_2\}\bigr),\\
c_3(uv) &=\bigl([+,-,0],\ \min\{x_1,x_2\},\ \min\{y_1,y_2\},\ z_1\bigr)\quad\text{if }z_1=z_2,\\
c_3(uv) &=\bigl([+,0,0],\ \min\{x_1,x_2\},\ y_1,\ z_1\bigr)\quad\text{if }y_1=y_2,\ z_1=z_2.
\end{aligned}
$$

For $U\subseteq V(G)$, let $G[U]$ denote the induced subgraph. An edge $e\in E(G[U])$ has a **unique color in $U$** if no other edge of $G[U]$ has the same label $c_3(e)$.

# Your task

Show that for every vertex set $U\subseteq [n]^3$ with $|U|\ge 2$, there exist $u_1,u_2\in U$ such that the edge $u_1u_2$ has a color that appears **exactly once** in $G[U]$ under the coloring $c_3$ above.


You are given a file with a proof for $d=2$.

# Progress Notes for Round 0001

## Ideas
To tackle the problem for the case where $d=3$, we need to extend the proof strategy used for $d=2$. The main focus will be on understanding how the color map $c_3$ behaves in three dimensions and how the types of edges can be categorized based on the sign patterns. We can utilize the combinatorial nature of the types and the minimum function to establish a unique coloring for edges in the induced subgraph.

## Lemmas from Literature
1. **Pigeonhole Principle**: If we have more edges than colors, at least one color must repeat. This principle will be useful in showing that if we have sufficiently many edges, some must be unique.
   - *Why useful here*: It establishes a baseline for uniqueness in edge colors based on the number of edges and the number of possible color types.

2. **Counting Arguments**: If we can count the number of edges of each type and relate this to the number of vertices, we can argue about the existence of unique edges.
   - *Why useful here*: Helps in establishing bounds on the number of edges that can share the same color.

## Examples
Consider a small example with $n=2$:
- Vertices: $V(G) = ig\{(1,1,1), (1,1,2), (1,2,1), (2,1,1), (2,2,2)\big\}$.
- Analyzing the edges, we can compute the colors using $c_3$ and check for uniqueness. For instance, the edge between $(1,1,1)$ and $(1,1,2)$ gives $c_3 = ([0,+,0], 1, 1, 1)$.
- By checking all pairs, we can see how many edges have the same color and identify unique cases.

## Obstacles
A potential obstacle is the complexity of the sign patterns in three dimensions. The interactions between the coordinates could lead to a larger number of edge types than anticipated, complicating the counting argument. We need to ensure that we can systematically account for all possible cases of edge types.

## Next Steps
1. **Extend the proof for $d=3$**: Build on the existing proof for $d=2$ and adapt it to handle the additional dimension. Focus on how the sign patterns interact in this higher-dimensional space.
2. **Conduct further examples**: Test more combinations of vertices to see how the colors distribute and to identify unique edge colors systematically.
3. **Explore combinatorial bounds**: Investigate how the number of vertices and edges can be related to ensure that unique colors exist.

## Gaps in output.md
- The proof for $d=2$ might not directly translate to $d=3$. We need to explicitly state how the counting changes and how we can ensure uniqueness in three dimensions. This needs to be addressed in the output for completeness.

## round-0001 — model summary — 2025-08-29T13:19:32.149562Z
In this round, the focus was on extending the proof strategy from $d=2$ to $d=3$. Key ideas included analyzing the behavior of the color map $c_3$ in three dimensions and categorizing edges based on sign patterns. The Pigeonhole Principle and counting arguments were identified as useful tools for establishing uniqueness in edge colors. A small example with $n=2$ was explored to illustrate the color distribution and uniqueness of edges. However, challenges remain due to the complexity of sign patterns in three dimensions, necessitating a systematic approach to account for all edge types. The next steps involve extending the proof for $d=3$, conducting further examples, and exploring combinatorial bounds.

=== round-0001/verifier.feedback.md ===
The prover has made a commendable effort in outlining a strategy to extend the proof from dimension $d=2$ to $d=3$. The use of the Pigeonhole Principle and counting arguments is appropriate and relevant for establishing uniqueness in edge colors. However, the report lacks rigorous justification for how these lemmas will be applied specifically in the context of three dimensions. The examples provided are a good start, but they need to be expanded with more detailed calculations and systematic checks for edge color uniqueness. The mention of potential obstacles is insightful, but it would be beneficial to propose specific methods to overcome these challenges. The next steps outlined are promising, particularly the focus on combinatorial bounds and further examples, which could lead to significant insights. I recommend that the prover explicitly define how the counting changes when moving from $d=2$ to $d=3$, and provide a more detailed exploration of the edge types and their interactions. This will strengthen the argument for uniqueness and help in building a rigorous proof for $d=3$. Overall, while there is no fully proven theorem yet, the groundwork laid here is valuable and could lead to meaningful progress in subsequent rounds.
