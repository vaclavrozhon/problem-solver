If some coordinate-hyperplane contains at least two points of U, apply the 2D theorem on that slice and note the 3D color coincides with the 2D color plus the fixed equal coordinate, hence remains unique in G[U].\\n- Handle the complementary case where every coordinate-hyperplane contains at most one point of U (\\\"full injectivity\\\"). Then any edge whose sign pattern has exactly one \u201cminus\u201d (or exactly one \u201cplus\u201d) already has uniquely determined endpoints for the color parameters, making the color unique. If no such mixed pattern exists, U is a chain under the product order; the top two points yield a type [+++] edge with multiplicity 1.\\n\\nCounting facts in 3D (used later)\\nFor p=(x,y,z) and U\u2282[n]^3, write\\nNE_3(p)= { q\u2208U : q_x>x, q_y>y, q_z>z }.\\n\\nFact A (type [+++]).

If c_3(e)=([+++],\u2113) then \u2113 is the componentwise minimum and all three coordinates strictly increase; thus \u2113 must be one endpoint, and the other endpoint is any q\u2208NE_3(\u2113). Conversely, each q\u2208NE_3(\u2113) with \u2113\u2208U yields such an edge.\\n\\nFact B (type with exactly one minus). Fix the representative (+,+,\u2212) (minus in z) and let \u2113=(\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3). Define\\nr_z(\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3)= #{ v\u2208U : v_x=\u03b1, v_y=\u03b2, v_z>\u03b3 },\\ns_{xy}(\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3)= #{ u\u2208U : u_z=\u03b3, u_x>\u03b1, u_y>\u03b2 }.\\nThen\\n# { e\u2208E(G[U]) : c_3(e)=([++\u2212], (\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3)) } = r_z(\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3) \u00b7 s_{xy}(\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3).\\nProof. Orient each such edge so its sign vector is (+,+,\u2212).

If U contains two points in a coordinate plane (say z=t), then G[U] has an edge of unique color under c_3.\\nProof. Consider U_t={ (x,y) : (x,y,t)\u2208U }\u2282[n]^2. Apply the 2D theorem to U_t: there exists an edge with a 2D color unique in G[U_t]. The corresponding 3D edge lies in the plane z=t and has type with z\u2013coordinate 0; its 3D color is exactly the 2D color together with the remembered equal coordinate t. No edge outside the plane has z\u2013type 0, so the color is unique in G[U].\\n\\nInjective\u2013planes case\\nDefinition. U satisfies (I) if for every \u03b1, each plane x=\u03b1 contains \u22641 point of U, each plane y=\u03b1 contains \u22641 point, and each plane z=\u03b1 contains \u22641 point. Equivalently, the projections x,y,z are injective on U.\\n\\nLemma 2 (uniqueness under (I)). If U satisfies (I) and |U|\u22652, then G[U] contains a uniquely colored edge under c_3.\\nProof.\\n- Case A: There exists a pair u,v with exactly one minus sign in its sign pattern (equivalently, exactly two pluses). WLOG take pattern (+,+,\u2212). Let \u2113=(\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3)=(min{x(u),x(v)}, min{y(u),y(v)}, min{z(u),z(v)}). Then r_z(\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3)\u22641 (since plane x=\u03b1 has \u22641 point) and s_{xy}(\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3)\u22641 (since plane z=\u03b3 has \u22641 point). Because u,v realize this color, r_z=s_{xy}=1, so Fact B gives multiplicity 1.\\n- Case B: There exists a pair with exactly one plus (two minuses). By symmetry (apply Fact B with coordinates permuted), the edge color is unique.\\n- Case C: No pair has exactly one minus or exactly one plus. Then every pair has either (+++) or (---), so U is totally ordered by the product order. Let w be the second\u2013largest element. Then NE_3(w)={top element}, hence by Fact A the [+++] color with lower corner w has multiplicity 1.\\nIn every case a unique color exists.\\n\\nMain theorem in 3D\\nTheorem. For every U\u2282[n]^3 with |U|\u22652, there exist u_1,u_2\u2208U such that the edge u_1u_2 has a color that appears exactly once in G[U] under c_3.\\nProof. If some coordinate plane x=\u03b1 or y=\u03b2 or z=\u03b3 contains \u22652 points of U, apply Lemma 1 to that plane to obtain a unique color. Otherwise every such plane contains \u22641 point, so (I) holds; Lemma 2 yields a unique color.\\n\\nExamples (sanity checks)\\n- Chain: U={(1,1,1),(2,2,2),(3,3,3)}. The edge between (2,2,2) and (3,3,3) has color ([+++],(2,2,2)) with multiplicity |NE_3(2,2,2)|=1.\\n- Mixed signs under (I): U={(1,1,3),(2,2,2),(3,3,1)}. The pair (3,3,1)\u2013(1,1,3) has pattern (+,+,\u2212) with \u2113=(1,1,1); by (I), r_z=s_{xy}=1, hence multiplicity 1.\\n- Slice case: U contains (1,1,5),(3,2,5),(4,4,5). Apply the 2D theorem on z=5 to find a unique color; it remains unique in 3D.\\n\\nObstacles and next steps\\n- The argument extends to dimension d\u22653: either a coordinate hyperplane contains \u22652 points (reduce to d\u22121), or every such hyperplane contains \u22641 point (full injectivity), in which case any edge with exactly one coordinate reversing direction yields a unique color; if none exist, U is a chain and the top two points give a unique [+,\u2026,+] color. Formalizing the general counting analogue of Fact B in d dimensions and writing the induction carefully would complete the d\u2013dimensional result.\\n\"\n}",
