(ii) No element of NE\u2083(a) can be \u227a\u2083\u2013comparable to another.\\n\\n# In\u2013plane structure and a cross\u2013plane propagation lemma\\n\\nFor a fixed level \u03b4, write NE\u2083(a)[z=\u03b4]:= {q\u2208NE\u2083(a): z(q)=\u03b4}. Inside this plane treat x,y as in d=2.\\n\\nDefinition (In\u2013plane partially row\u2013good at level \u03b4). A pair b\u2081,b\u2082\u2208NE\u2083(a)[z=\u03b4] on the same row y=\u03b2 with x(b\u2081)<x(b\u2082) is partially row\u2013good in the plane if:\\n- (PR1\u2082D) within z=\u03b4, b\u2081,b\u2082 are the last two points on row \u03b2 (second\u2013rightmost/rightmost in x);\\n- (PR2\u2082D) within z=\u03b4, every other point q with y(q)\u2265\u03b2 satisfies x(q)<x(b\u2081).\\nThis is exactly Definition 2.6 applied to the 2D set NE\u2083(a)[z=\u03b4], ignoring z.\\n\\nObservation (existence of a starting in\u2013plane pair). If NE\u2083(a)[z=\u03b4] contains at least two points, then there exists an in\u2013plane partially row\u2013good pair: take the topmost row \u03b2 in that plane that has at least two points, and pick the two rightmost on that row; (PR1\u2082D),(PR2\u2082D) hold by construction inside the plane.\\n\\nLemma (Cross\u2013plane propagation via (++\u2212)). Assume (H), let a be lex\u2013max eligible, and let \u03b4 be a z\u2013level with NE\u2083(a)[z=\u03b4]\u2260\u2205. If there is a lower z\u2013level\\n  \u03b3:= max{z\u2032<\u03b4: NE\u2083(a)[z=z\u2032]\u2260\u2205},\\nthen for any in\u2013plane partially row\u2013good pair b\u2081,b\u2082\u2208NE\u2083(a)[z=\u03b4] on row \u03b2 with x(b\u2081)<x(b\u2082), there exist two points c\u2081,c\u2082\u2208NE\u2083(a)[z=\u03b3] with\\n  x(c_i)>x(b\u2081) and y(c_i)>y(b\u2081), i=1,2.\\n\\nProof. Consider the (++\u2212) color with parameters (\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3)=(x(b\u2081),y(b\u2081),\u03b3). By the multiplicity formula,\\n  N_{++\u2212}(\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3)= r_z(\u03b1,\u03b2;\u03b3)\u00b7 s_{xy}(\u03b1,\u03b2;\u03b3).\\nBecause \u03b3 is the immediate lower level below \u03b4 supporting NE\u2083(a), there are no points with z\u2208(\u03b3,\u03b4) in NE\u2083(a); on level z=\u03b4, the fibre {(x,y)=(\u03b1,\u03b2)} contains exactly b\u2081; there is no level above \u03b4 in NE\u2083(a). Hence r_z(\u03b1,\u03b2;\u03b3)=1. Under (H) the color cannot be unique, so s_{xy}(\u03b1,\u03b2;\u03b3)\u22652, i.e., there are at least two points on z=\u03b3 with x>\u03b1 and y>\u03b2. These are c\u2081,c\u2082.\\n\\nRemark (why no extra in\u2013plane hypothesis is needed). The argument uses only: (i) \u03b4 is a top level above \u03b3 within NE\u2083(a), and (ii) the (++\u2212) identity. No further in\u2013plane exclusions are needed to certify r_z=1.\\n\\n# Example illustrating an obstacle for naive iteration\\n\\nEven with the propagation lemma, an attempt to iterate plane\u2013by\u2013plane may fail if vertical duplicates occur (same (x,y) at multiple z). For instance, take U consisting of the three points\\n  p\u2081=(2,2,4), p\u2082=(3,3,3), p\u2083=(2,2,2).\\nFor a=(1,1,1), NE\u2083(a)={p\u2081,p\u2082,p\u2083}. The top plane is z=4 with a single point p\u2081, so we would start instead at z=3 with only p\u2082. Moving down to z=2 gives p\u2083 but note that (x,y)=(2,2) occurs at two z\u2013levels (4 and 2). If at some step we select b\u2081\u2032 with (\u03b1\u2032,\u03b2\u2032)=(2,2) on z=2 and attempt to push to \u03b3=\u2026 there can be r_z(\u03b1\u2032,\u03b2\u2032;\u03b3)\u22652 (witnessed by p\u2081 and b\u2081\u2032), allowing s_{xy} to drop to 1 without violating (H). This shows that a blind \u201calways take the rightmost two\u201d can stall. A refined selection (avoid columns that recur above) or an axis\u2013switch is likely needed.\\n\\n# Next steps toward a full 3D proof\\n\\n- Axis\u2013choice and dichotomy. In d=2 we proved a dichotomy (row\u2013good or column\u2013good) for a lex\u2013max eligible point. In d=3 a plausible analogue is: for lex\u2013max eligible a, at least one of the three coordinates admits a \u201cplane\u2013good\u201d structure from which one can propagate strictly in that coordinate (using a one\u2013minus type) until the lowest such plane. Formalize a 3\u2013way dichotomy with in\u2013plane partially good pairs on the top supporting plane for that coordinate.\\n- Selection rule to defeat vertical duplicates. Augment the in\u2013plane selection to avoid picking b\u2081 whose (x(b\u2081),y(b\u2081)) appears at a higher plane. Under a mild combinatorial lemma (to be proved), either there are at least two \u201cvertically unique\u201d choices on the plane, or one can force a (+++) unique color earlier.\\n- Local cone\u2013maximality. The 2D \u201ccone\u2013maximal implies local antichain\u201d (used to apply dichotomy locally) has a verbatim 3D analogue. This should let us apply the dichotomy not only at the global lex\u2013max a, but also at intermediate points produced by a horizontal/vertical/z\u2013propagation, enabling the final \u201crightward\u2013and\u2013downward\u201d termination as in d=2.\\n- No\u2013eligible case in 3D. Generalize Lemma 6.5 (no eligible \u21d2 unique color) by considering minimal supporting planes in each coordinate and applying the summed multiplicity for |J|=1,2 types. The 2D logic (\u201ca duplicate at a higher level creates an NE\u2013witness\u201d) extends with the third coordinate checked.\\n\\n# Rigorous statements ready to be integrated\\n\\n1) Proposition (Multiplicity for any type T). With P(T),M(T),E(T) and m as above,\\n   N_T(m)=\u2211_{w\u2208[n]^{E(T)}} |{u\u2208U: u_P=m_P, u_E=w, u_M>m_M}| \u00b7 |{v\u2208U: v_M=m_M, v_E=w, v_P>m_P}|.\\n   In particular for (+++) and (++\u2212) we get the simplified formulas (all\u2013plus; one\u2013minus product).\\n\\n2) Lemma (3D lex\u2013max antichain). For a lex\u2013max eligible a (w.r.t. (z,y,x) lex), NE\u2083(q)=\u2205 for all q\u2208NE\u2083(a).\\n\\n3) In\u2013plane starting pair. If a z\u2013plane \u03b4 supports at least two points of NE\u2083(a), there exists an in\u2013plane partially row\u2013good pair b\u2081,b\u2082\u2208NE\u2083(a)[z=\u03b4] (2D Definition (PR1),(PR2) applied inside the plane).\\n\\n4) Lemma (Cross\u2013plane propagation via (++\u2212)). Under (H), if \u03b4 is a z\u2013level with NE\u2083(a)[\u03b4]\u2260\u2205 and \u03b3<\u03b4 is the highest lower z\u2013level supporting NE\u2083(a), then for any in\u2013plane partially row\u2013good pair b\u2081,b\u2082 on \u03b4 there exist c\u2081,c\u2082 on \u03b3 with x(c_i)>x(b\u2081), y(c_i)>y(b\u2081).\\n\\nThese items are independent, checkable steps. Items (1) and (4) give the key \u201cproduct forcing\u201d across z\u2013levels; item (2) is the standard cone\u2013maximality tool; item (3) furnishes a canonical starting pair inside a plane.\\n\\n# Why useful here\\n\\n- (1) supplies the exact multiplicity identities to invoke (H) quantitatively.\\n- (2) is the 3D analogue of Lemma 3.2 used throughout the 2D proof.\\n- (3)+(4) replicate the \u201cpartially good \u21d2 propagation to the next level\u201d engine, now across z\u2013levels via the (++\u2212) type, which carries the z\u2013minimum in the color (so no cross\u2013plane color collision occurs).\\n\\n# Obstacles\\n\\n- Vertical duplicates can make r_z>1 at subsequent steps, blocking the inference s_{xy}\u22652 from (H). We either need a selection scheme to avoid such columns, or we must switch to another coordinate and propagate there.\\n- Slices with |J|=2 (one zero) generate colors that ignore one coordinate; uniqueness must then be certified globally via a cross\u2013slice argument (as in 2D Lemma 6.5), which remains to be written in 3D.\\n\\n# Proposed immediate next tasks for the verifier\\n\\n- Incorporate Proposition \u201cMultiplicity for any T\u201d (with its proof) into proofs.md; this will be referenced repeatedly.\\n- Verify the cross\u2013plane propagation lemma in full detail using the (++\u2212) identity.\\n- Attempt to prove a small \u201cvertical uniqueness or force (+++)\u201d claim: on a top z\u2013plane with at least two points, either there are two points whose (x,y) pairs do not occur on any higher plane (trivial here since topmost) and at least one of which does not occur on any lower plane, or else the all\u2013plus color from some base triggers uniqueness.\\n- Explore toy counterexamples to refine the selection rule; the example above shows why a naive iteration may stall.\\n\\n# End\"\n}",
