Ideas
- Reduce the 3D problem to the solved 2D case on coordinate slices. If some coordinate-hyperplane contains at least two points of U, apply the 2D theorem on that slice and note the 3D color coincides with the 2D color plus the fixed equal coordinate, hence remains unique in G[U].
- Handle the complementary case where every coordinate-hyperplane contains at most one point of U ("full injectivity"). Then any edge whose sign pattern has exactly one “minus” (or exactly one “plus”) already has uniquely determined endpoints for the color parameters, making the color unique. If no such mixed pattern exists, U is a chain under the product order; the top two points yield a type [+++] edge with multiplicity 1.

Counting facts in 3D (used later)
For p=(x,y,z) and U⊂[n]^3, write
NE_3(p)= { q∈U : q_x>x, q_y>y, q_z>z }.

Fact A (type [+++]). For (α,β,γ)∈[n]^3,
# { e∈E(G[U]) : c_3(e)=([+++], (α,β,γ)) } = 1_{(α,β,γ)∈U} · |NE_3(α,β,γ)|.
Proof. If c_3(e)=([+++],ℓ) then ℓ is the componentwise minimum and all three coordinates strictly increase; thus ℓ must be one endpoint, and the other endpoint is any q∈NE_3(ℓ). Conversely, each q∈NE_3(ℓ) with ℓ∈U yields such an edge.

Fact B (type with exactly one minus). Fix the representative (+,+,−) (minus in z) and let ℓ=(α,β,γ). Define
r_z(α,β,γ)= #{ v∈U : v_x=α, v_y=β, v_z>γ },
s_{xy}(α,β,γ)= #{ u∈U : u_z=γ, u_x>α, u_y>β }.
Then
# { e∈E(G[U]) : c_3(e)=([++−], (α,β,γ)) } = r_z(α,β,γ) · s_{xy}(α,β,γ).
Proof. Orient each such edge so its sign vector is (+,+,−). Then the lower corner is (v_x,v_y,u_z)=(α,β,γ), forcing v_x=α, v_y=β and u_z=γ, with u_x>α,u_y>β and v_z>γ. This gives a bijection between such edges and pairs (v,u) with v counted by r_z and u by s_{xy}.

Slice–reduction lemma (3D→2D)
Lemma 1. If U contains two points in a coordinate plane (say z=t), then G[U] has an edge of unique color under c_3.
Proof. Consider U_t={ (x,y) : (x,y,t)∈U }⊂[n]^2. Apply the 2D theorem to U_t: there exists an edge with a 2D color unique in G[U_t]. The corresponding 3D edge lies in the plane z=t and has type with z–coordinate 0; its 3D color is exactly the 2D color together with the remembered equal coordinate t. No edge outside the plane has z–type 0, so the color is unique in G[U].

Injective–planes case
Definition. U satisfies (I) if for every α, each plane x=α contains ≤1 point of U, each plane y=α contains ≤1 point, and each plane z=α contains ≤1 point. Equivalently, the projections x,y,z are injective on U.

Lemma 2 (uniqueness under (I)). If U satisfies (I) and |U|≥2, then G[U] contains a uniquely colored edge under c_3.
Proof.
- Case A: There exists a pair u,v with exactly one minus sign in its sign pattern (equivalently, exactly two pluses). WLOG take pattern (+,+,−). Let ℓ=(α,β,γ)=(min{x(u),x(v)}, min{y(u),y(v)}, min{z(u),z(v)}). Then r_z(α,β,γ)≤1 (since plane x=α has ≤1 point) and s_{xy}(α,β,γ)≤1 (since plane z=γ has ≤1 point). Because u,v realize this color, r_z=s_{xy}=1, so Fact B gives multiplicity 1.
- Case B: There exists a pair with exactly one plus (two minuses). By symmetry (apply Fact B with coordinates permuted), the edge color is unique.
- Case C: No pair has exactly one minus or exactly one plus. Then every pair has either (+++) or (---), so U is totally ordered by the product order. Let w be the second–largest element. Then NE_3(w)={top element}, hence by Fact A the [+++] color with lower corner w has multiplicity 1.
In every case a unique color exists.

Main theorem in 3D
Theorem. For every U⊂[n]^3 with |U|≥2, there exist u_1,u_2∈U such that the edge u_1u_2 has a color that appears exactly once in G[U] under c_3.
Proof. If some coordinate plane x=α or y=β or z=γ contains ≥2 points of U, apply Lemma 1 to that plane to obtain a unique color. Otherwise every such plane contains ≤1 point, so (I) holds; Lemma 2 yields a unique color.

Examples (sanity checks)
- Chain: U={(1,1,1),(2,2,2),(3,3,3)}. The edge between (2,2,2) and (3,3,3) has color ([+++],(2,2,2)) with multiplicity |NE_3(2,2,2)|=1.
- Mixed signs under (I): U={(1,1,3),(2,2,2),(3,3,1)}. The pair (3,3,1)–(1,1,3) has pattern (+,+,−) with ℓ=(1,1,1); by (I), r_z=s_{xy}=1, hence multiplicity 1.
- Slice case: U contains (1,1,5),(3,2,5),(4,4,5). Apply the 2D theorem on z=5 to find a unique color; it remains unique in 3D.

Obstacles and next steps
- The argument extends to dimension d≥3: either a coordinate hyperplane contains ≥2 points (reduce to d−1), or every such hyperplane contains ≤1 point (full injectivity), in which case any edge with exactly one coordinate reversing direction yields a unique color; if none exist, U is a chain and the top two points give a unique [+,…,+] color. Formalizing the general counting analogue of Fact B in d dimensions and writing the induction carefully would complete the d–dimensional result.
