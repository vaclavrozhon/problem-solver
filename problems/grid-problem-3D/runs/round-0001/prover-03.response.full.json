For any type T and \u2113, the number of edges e in G[U] with c3(e)=(T,\u2113) equals A_+(T,\u2113)\u00b7A_\u2212(T,\u2113). This product is independent of the chosen representative s of T (swapping s\u21a6\u2212s swaps A_+ and A_\u2212).\\n\\nProof (sketch, rigorous). Orient an undirected edge {u,v} to (u\u2192v) so that for each i\u2208J(T), the oriented difference has sign s_i: if s_i=+ then v_i>u_i and if s_i=\u2212 then u_i>v_i; for i\u2208E(T) both equal. The lower corner \u2113(u,v) is precisely the componentwise minimum, and by construction u (resp. v) satisfies the defining constraints of A_\u2212 (resp. A_+). Conversely, any choice of u counted by A_\u2212 and v counted by A_+ yields an oriented edge whose unordered pair has type T and lower corner \u2113. This correspondence is bijective at the oriented level; passing to unordered edges counts A_+\u00b7A_\u2212.

For c\u2208{x,y,z} and \u03bb\u2208[n], set U[c=\u03bb]:= {p\u2208U: p_c=\u03bb}.\\n\\nLemma (slice\u2192global). If for some c,\u03bb we have |U[c=\u03bb]|\u22652, then G[U] contains an edge whose color under c3 is unique in G[U].\\n\\nProof. WLOG c=z and denote U_\u03bb=U[z=\u03bb]. Consider the 2D point set V_\u03bb={ (x(p),y(p)) : p\u2208U_\u03bb } with the d=2 coloring from the provided theorem. Apply that theorem to obtain an edge pq within U_\u03bb whose 2D color is unique in G[U_\u03bb]. Under c3, pq has type with E(T)={z} and \u2113_z=\u03bb. Its color (T,\u2113) is unique inside the z=\u03bb plane by the d=2 theorem. No edge from a different z-plane can share this color because \u2113_z is part of the label and E(T)={z} differs from any edge whose z-coordinates differ. Hence (T,\u2113) is unique in G[U].\\n\\n# The \u201crainbow\u201d case (no two points share a coordinate value)\\nAssume |U[x=\u03b1]|\u22641 for all \u03b1, and similarly for y and z. Equivalently, all coordinates of points in U are pairwise distinct when projected coordinatewise.\\n\\nLemma (any mixed-sign edge is unique). If an edge has type T with support J(T)={x,y,z} and T is not [+++] mod sign (i.e., some + and some \u2212 appear), then its color under c3 appears at most once in G[U].\\n\\nProof. Use the multiplicity formula with, say, T=[+,+,\u2212] (the other mixed patterns are analogous). Then A_\u2212 counts u with (x,y)=(\u2113_x,\u2113_y) and z>\u2113_z; by the rainbow condition there is at most one such u (indeed at most one point has x=\u2113_x). Similarly A_+ counts v with z=\u2113_z and x>\u2113_x, y>\u2113_y; again at most one such v (at most one point has z=\u2113_z). Thus A_\u2212,A_+\u2208{0,1}, so the multiplicity is \u22641. For the given edge both factors are 1, hence multiplicity =1.\\n\\nLemma (no mixed edges \u21d2 chain \u21d2 a unique [+++]-color). If every edge in G[U] has type [+++] mod sign, then U is a chain in the product order (coordinatewise). Listing U as p_1\u227ap_2\u227a\u22ef\u227ap_k, we have |NE_3(p_{k-1})|=1; by the [+++] specialization, color ([+++],\u2113=p_{k-1}) appears exactly once.\\n\\nProof. If some pair were incomparable, their sign pattern would mix + and \u2212, contradicting the hypothesis. In a chain, NE_3(p_i)={p_{i+1},\u2026,p_k}, hence NE_3(p_{k-1}) has size 1, yielding the unique [+++]-color by the multiplicity formula.\\n\\n# Main theorem in dimension 3\\nTheorem. For every U\u2286[n]^3 with |U|\u22652, there is an edge in G[U] whose color under c3 appears exactly once in G[U].\\n\\nProof. If some slice U[c=\u03bb] has size \u22652, apply the slice\u2192global lemma and the given d=2 theorem to obtain a globally unique color. Otherwise, U is rainbow. If G[U] contains a mixed-sign edge, it is unique by the mixed-edge lemma. If not, all edges are [+++] mod sign and the chain lemma provides a unique [+++]-color. In all cases a unique color exists.\\n\\n# Examples / sanity checks\\n- Chain: U={(1,1,1),(2,2,2),(3,3,3)}. Color ([+++],\u2113=(2,2,2)) appears once (edge to the top), others repeat.\\n- Slice: U contains two points with z=5; apply d=2 on that plane to get a unique color of type E(T)={z}, hence globally unique.\\n- Rainbow/mixed: U={(1,4,7),(3,2,5)} has type [+,-,-]; by the mixed-edge lemma, its color is unique.\\n\\n# Obstacles / checks\\n- The only place we use the d=2 proof is inside a slice; uniqueness lifts because c3 records the fixed coordinate.\\n- The multiplicity product formula is the 3D analogue of Facts 2.1\u20132.2 and is used to certify uniqueness in the rainbow case and in the chain case.\\n\\n# Next steps\\n- Formalize an induction to all dimensions d with the same color c_d (type modulo \u00b1 together with the lower corner), using the same slice reduction and the rainbow/chain dichotomy.\\n- Quantitative questions: lower bounds on the number of unique colors in terms of |U|; extremal configurations attaining few unique colors.\\n\"\n}",
