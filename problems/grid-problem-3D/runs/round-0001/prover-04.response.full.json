If all pairs are comparable (a chain), the (+++)\u2013type multiplicity formula gives uniqueness at the second\u2013largest point.\\n\\n# Setup and notation (3D)\\n- For p=(x,y,z)\u2208U, define its strict 3D north\u2013east set\\n  NE_3D(p):={q\u2208U: x(q)>x(p), y(q)>y(p), z(q)>z(p)}.\\n- For t\u2208[n] and i\u2208{x,y,z}, write the i\u2013plane at level t as \u03a0_i(t):={v\u2208[n]^3: v_i=t}.

Fix i\u2208{x,y,z} and t\u2208[n]. Consider the induced subgraph on U_i[t]. Identify a point (in that plane) with its pair of remaining coordinates. Then for edges within U_i[t], the map e\u21a6c_3(e) restricted to types with i\u2208E(T) is exactly the 2D coloring c_2 on the remaining two coordinates, with the extra fixed coordinate t_i=t appended to the label.\\n\\nProof. Inside \u03a0_i(t) edges have i\u2013coordinate equal, so their 3D type has i\u2208E(T). The remaining two coordinates\u2019 sign class (modulo flip) and minima are exactly those of c_2; c_3 additionally stores i\u2019s fixed value t. Thus two edges have the same 3D color iff they have the same 2D color in the slice. Hence uniqueness in the slice implies uniqueness in G[U].\\n\\nCorollary 2.

If u\u2264v coordinatewise (strict), \u2113(u,v)=u and the type is (+++). Conversely any w\u2208NE_3D(\u03b1) forms such an edge with \u03b1. Distinct w give distinct edges and distinct colors are separated by \u03b1.\\n\\nFact B (one odd coordinate). Fix T with J(T)={x,y,z} whose (mod\u2013flip) sign pattern has exactly one coordinate \u201codd,\u201d say the odd coordinate is i (the other two share the same sign).

For c_3(e)=(T,\u03b1) with odd coordinate i, the two endpoints must be exactly of the form p on the \u03b1\u2013anchored i\u2013line with p_i>\u03b1_i and q in the \u03b1_i\u2013plane with the other two coordinates strictly larger than \u03b1 (this is the 3D analogue of the 2D \u201copposite\u2013sign\u201d rectangle factorization). This correspondence is bijective, giving the product count.\\n\\n# Coordinatewise\u2013injective case\\nAssume that every coordinate plane contains at most one point of U (i.e., for each fixed value of x, at most one point of U has that x, and similarly for y and z). Then:\\n- For any \u03b1 and any i, r_i(\u03b1)\u22641 and s_{\u2260i}(\u03b1)\u22641 (because fixing two coordinates determines at most one point of U by injectivity).\\n- If there exists an incomparable pair u,v (in product order), let i be the odd coordinate of their type and set \u03b1=\u2113(u,v). Then u contributes to r_i(\u03b1) and v to s_{\u2260i}(\u03b1), so r_i(\u03b1)=s_{\u2260i}(\u03b1)=1 and by Fact B the color is unique.\\n- If all pairs are comparable (U is a chain), let a be the second\u2013largest element in the chain. Then NE_3D(a)={max} has size 1, so by Fact A the (+++)\u2013color (T,\u2113) with \u2113=a is unique.\\n\\nConclusion 3 (injective case). If every coordinate plane contains \u22641 point, G[U] has a uniquely colored edge.\\n\\n# Main theorem (d=3)\\nTheorem. For every U\u2286[n]^3 with |U|\u22652, there exist u_1,u_2\u2208U such that the edge u_1u_2 has a color that appears exactly once in G[U] under c_3.\\n\\nProof. If some coordinate plane \u03a0_i(t) contains at least two points, apply Corollary 2 to get a unique color via the 2D theorem on that slice. Otherwise every coordinate plane contains at most one point, so Conclusion 3 applies, yielding a unique color. \u220e\\n\\n# Examples (sanity checks)\\n- Slice case: U={ (1,1,1),(2,2,1),(3,1,2) }. In the z=1 plane, the 2D theorem returns a unique color; in 3D this is of type [\u00b1,\u00b1,0] with t_z=1, hence unique globally.\\n- Injective incomparable: U={(1,3,1),(3,1,3)}. Their type has odd coordinate y, \u03b1=(1,1,1). Here r_y(\u03b1)=s_{xz}(\u03b1)=1, so the color is unique by Fact B.\\n- Injective chain: U={(1,1,1),(2,2,2),(3,3,3)}. The (+++) color from a=(2,2,2) is unique by Fact A.\\n\\n# Obstacles and next steps\\n- The above gives a clean, checkable 3D proof leveraging the provided d=2 theorem plus two elementary multiplicity facts. A natural next step is to formalize the d\u2013dimensional induction: if some coordinate hyperplane has \u22652 points, reduce to (d\u22121); else in the injective case, either pick an incomparable pair to get an \u201codd\u2013subset\u201d type with multiplicity 1, or use the all\u2013plus type on a point with exactly one NE\u2013neighbor in the poset chain. Formalizing the general r\u00b7s\u2013type multiplicity for a given odd subset of coordinates is routine by the same rectangle (orthant) factorization.\\n\"\n}",
