# Ideas
- Reduce 3D to 2D on a coordinate plane when that plane contains at least two points: uniqueness in the slice (by the provided d=2 theorem) lifts to uniqueness in 3D because the color c_3 records the fixed coordinate value t_i.
- If every coordinate plane contains at most one point (coordinatewise injective set), then any incomparable pair immediately yields a unique color of an “odd–coordinate” type via a product multiplicity formula r·s that is forced to equal 1. If all pairs are comparable (a chain), the (+++)–type multiplicity formula gives uniqueness at the second–largest point.

# Setup and notation (3D)
- For p=(x,y,z)∈U, define its strict 3D north–east set
  NE_3D(p):={q∈U: x(q)>x(p), y(q)>y(p), z(q)>z(p)}.
- For t∈[n] and i∈{x,y,z}, write the i–plane at level t as Π_i(t):={v∈[n]^3: v_i=t}. The slice of U in this plane is U_i[t]:=U∩Π_i(t).
- The color c_3(e)=(T,ℓ(u,v)) as in the task: T remembers which coordinates are nonzero (J(T)) and their sign pattern modulo a global sign; ℓ is the componentwise minimum, recording equal coordinates explicitly.

# Slice lifting (2D→3D)
Lemma 1 (slice lifting). Fix i∈{x,y,z} and t∈[n]. Consider the induced subgraph on U_i[t]. Identify a point (in that plane) with its pair of remaining coordinates. Then for edges within U_i[t], the map e↦c_3(e) restricted to types with i∈E(T) is exactly the 2D coloring c_2 on the remaining two coordinates, with the extra fixed coordinate t_i=t appended to the label.

Proof. Inside Π_i(t) edges have i–coordinate equal, so their 3D type has i∈E(T). The remaining two coordinates’ sign class (modulo flip) and minima are exactly those of c_2; c_3 additionally stores i’s fixed value t. Thus two edges have the same 3D color iff they have the same 2D color in the slice. Hence uniqueness in the slice implies uniqueness in G[U].

Corollary 2. If |U_i[t]|≥2 for some i,t, then G[U] has an edge whose c_3–color is unique.

# Multiplicity facts in 3D (for use in the injective case)
Fact A (all–plus type). For T with J(T)={x,y,z} and all three signs equal (mod flip, the “(+++)–class”), and for α∈[n]^3,
  #{e∈E(G[U]): c_3(e)=(T,α)} = 1_{α∈U} · |NE_3D(α)|.
In particular, (T,α) is unique iff α∈U and |NE_3D(α)|=1.

Proof. If u≤v coordinatewise (strict), ℓ(u,v)=u and the type is (+++). Conversely any w∈NE_3D(α) forms such an edge with α. Distinct w give distinct edges and distinct colors are separated by α.

Fact B (one odd coordinate). Fix T with J(T)={x,y,z} whose (mod–flip) sign pattern has exactly one coordinate “odd,” say the odd coordinate is i (the other two share the same sign). For α∈[n]^3, define
- r_i(α):= |{ p∈U: p_j=α_j for j≠i and p_i>α_i }| (points on the α–anchored line increasing in i),
- s_{≠i}(α):= |{ q∈U: q_i=α_i and q_j>α_j for all j≠i }| (points in the α_i–plane strictly NE in the other two coordinates).
Then
  #{e∈E(G[U]): c_3(e)=(T,α)} = r_i(α)·s_{≠i}(α).
In particular, (T,α) is unique iff r_i(α)=s_{≠i}(α)=1.

Proof. For c_3(e)=(T,α) with odd coordinate i, the two endpoints must be exactly of the form p on the α–anchored i–line with p_i>α_i and q in the α_i–plane with the other two coordinates strictly larger than α (this is the 3D analogue of the 2D “opposite–sign” rectangle factorization). This correspondence is bijective, giving the product count.

# Coordinatewise–injective case
Assume that every coordinate plane contains at most one point of U (i.e., for each fixed value of x, at most one point of U has that x, and similarly for y and z). Then:
- For any α and any i, r_i(α)≤1 and s_{≠i}(α)≤1 (because fixing two coordinates determines at most one point of U by injectivity).
- If there exists an incomparable pair u,v (in product order), let i be the odd coordinate of their type and set α=ℓ(u,v). Then u contributes to r_i(α) and v to s_{≠i}(α), so r_i(α)=s_{≠i}(α)=1 and by Fact B the color is unique.
- If all pairs are comparable (U is a chain), let a be the second–largest element in the chain. Then NE_3D(a)={max} has size 1, so by Fact A the (+++)–color (T,ℓ) with ℓ=a is unique.

Conclusion 3 (injective case). If every coordinate plane contains ≤1 point, G[U] has a uniquely colored edge.

# Main theorem (d=3)
Theorem. For every U⊆[n]^3 with |U|≥2, there exist u_1,u_2∈U such that the edge u_1u_2 has a color that appears exactly once in G[U] under c_3.

Proof. If some coordinate plane Π_i(t) contains at least two points, apply Corollary 2 to get a unique color via the 2D theorem on that slice. Otherwise every coordinate plane contains at most one point, so Conclusion 3 applies, yielding a unique color. ∎

# Examples (sanity checks)
- Slice case: U={ (1,1,1),(2,2,1),(3,1,2) }. In the z=1 plane, the 2D theorem returns a unique color; in 3D this is of type [±,±,0] with t_z=1, hence unique globally.
- Injective incomparable: U={(1,3,1),(3,1,3)}. Their type has odd coordinate y, α=(1,1,1). Here r_y(α)=s_{xz}(α)=1, so the color is unique by Fact B.
- Injective chain: U={(1,1,1),(2,2,2),(3,3,3)}. The (+++) color from a=(2,2,2) is unique by Fact A.

# Obstacles and next steps
- The above gives a clean, checkable 3D proof leveraging the provided d=2 theorem plus two elementary multiplicity facts. A natural next step is to formalize the d–dimensional induction: if some coordinate hyperplane has ≥2 points, reduce to (d−1); else in the injective case, either pick an incomparable pair to get an “odd–subset” type with multiplicity 1, or use the all–plus type on a point with exactly one NE–neighbor in the poset chain. Formalizing the general r·s–type multiplicity for a given odd subset of coordinates is routine by the same rectangle (orthant) factorization.
