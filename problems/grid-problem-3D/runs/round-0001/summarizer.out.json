  "summary_md": "In this round we extended tools from the d=2 proof to 3D and identified the remaining gaps. We proved a master multiplicity lemma for the 3D coloring c3 that counts edges of a given type and minima as a sum over E(T)-slices, and derived corollaries: the all-coordinates-changing case equals 1_{m\u2208U}\u00b7|NE3(m)|, and explicit slice formulas for two-changing/one-equal and one-changing/two-equal types. We proved a lexicographic-maximal eligible point yields an antichain NE3(a). Using these tools we completed a rigorous special case: if the projections to x,y,z are injective, then G[U] has a uniquely colored edge. The principal obstruction to lifting the 2D propagation argument is \u201cvertical duplicates\u201d (repeated (x,y) or similar across z) which prevent forcing an r=1 factor in global multiplicities. Plan: formalize topmost-plane propagation, handle duplicates (or trigger |J|=1 uniqueness), prove the 3D \u201cno eligible \u21d2 unique\u201d lemma, and complete a 3-way dichotomy + iterative contradiction to finish the proof.",
