  "summary_md": "Last round produced a short, complete proof for d=3 building on the provided d=2 file. The proof splits into two cases: (A) some coordinate slice (e.g. z=t) contains \u22652 points \u2014 apply the d=2 theorem on that slice and lift uniqueness to 3D because c_3 records the fixed coordinate; (B) every slice has \u22641 point \u2014 order by that coordinate and the edge between the top two levels has a uniquely determined lower-corner coordinate, hence a unique color. An alternate view factors color counts as A_+\u00b7A_\u2212 (product of witnesses), which gives the same conclusions and suggests an induction to general d.

    "Top-two-levels case: if every z-slice has \u22641 point, the edge between the two largest z-level vertices has a unique \u2113_z and thus unique c_3-color.",
    "Multiplicity factorization: for a fixed representative sign vector, the number of edges with color (T,\u2113) factors as A_+(T,\u2113)\u00b7A_\u2212(T,\u2113).",
    "Under slice-injectivity, mixed-sign types give factors \u22641 so any realized mixed-sign edge is unique; if no mixed-sign edges exist U is a chain and a [+++]-type at the penultimate element is unique.",
    "The same two-case strategy extends inductively to dimension d: either reduce to a (d\u22121)-slice or use the injective/top-two-level argument."
