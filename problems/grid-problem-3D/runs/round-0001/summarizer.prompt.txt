# Progress Notes for Round 0003

## Ideas
In this round, we will focus on developing a systematic approach to categorize and count edge types based on their sign patterns in three dimensions. The goal is to establish a clear transition from the proof for $d=2$ to $d=3$, highlighting how the counting of edge types changes with the additional dimension. We will also explore how the color map $c_3$ behaves in three dimensions to ensure that we can argue for the existence of unique edge colors.

## Lemmas from Literature
1. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**: This principle can be instrumental in counting the number of edges that share the same color and distinguishing unique cases. It allows for systematic accounting of overlaps in edge types and colors.
   - *Why useful here*: It helps to refine the counting arguments by ensuring that we do not double-count edges that may share colors.

2. **Combinatorial Geometry Results**: Known results in combinatorial geometry regarding the distribution of points in higher dimensions can provide insights into the density of edges and their colors.
   - *Why useful here*: It establishes a relationship between the number of vertices, edges, and the types of colors they can generate, which is crucial for proving uniqueness.

## Examples
Consider a small example with $n=3$:
- Vertices: $V(G) = \{(1,1,1), (1,1,2), (1,2,1), (2,1,1), (2,2,2), (3,3,3)\}$.
- Analyzing the edges, we can compute the colors using $c_3$ for various pairs. For instance, the edge between $(1,1,1)$ and $(1,1,2)$ gives $c_3 = ([0,+,0], 1, 1, 1)$, while the edge between $(1,2,1)$ and $(2,1,1)$ gives $c_3 = ([+,-,0], 1, 1, 1)$. By systematically checking all pairs, we can identify how many edges have the same color and pinpoint unique cases.

## Obstacles
A significant obstacle remains the complexity of the sign patterns in three dimensions. As we categorize edges based on their types, we need to ensure that we do not overlook any combinations that could lead to shared colors. Additionally, the potential increase in the number of edge types may complicate the counting argument further.

## Next Steps
1. **Draft a detailed proof for $d=3$**: This proof should explicitly outline how the counting changes when moving from $d=2$ to $d=3$. We will focus on the implications of the additional dimension on the edge types and their uniqueness.
2. **Conduct further examples**: Test more combinations of vertices, particularly focusing on edges that may yield unique colors. This empirical exploration will help validate our theoretical claims.
3. **Explore combinatorial bounds**: Investigate how the number of vertices and edges can be related to ensure that unique colors exist, potentially using the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle.

## Gaps in output.md
- The output for $d=2$ does not provide a clear transition to $d=3$. We need to explicitly outline how the counting of edge types changes and how we can ensure uniqueness in three dimensions. This gap needs to be addressed for completeness in the proof. Additionally, the examples provided in the earlier rounds need to be expanded with more detailed calculations to strengthen the argument for uniqueness.

# Progress Notes for Round 0002

## Ideas
To further develop the proof for the case where $d=3$, we need to delve deeper into the implications of the edge types defined by the sign patterns. Specifically, we should categorize the edges based on their types and analyze how many edges can share the same type. This will help in establishing a framework to demonstrate that at least one edge must have a unique color in the induced subgraph $G[U]$.
