Last round produced a short, complete proof for d=3 building on the provided d=2 file. The proof splits into two cases: (A) some coordinate slice (e.g. z=t) contains ≥2 points — apply the d=2 theorem on that slice and lift uniqueness to 3D because c_3 records the fixed coordinate; (B) every slice has ≤1 point — order by that coordinate and the edge between the top two levels has a uniquely determined lower-corner coordinate, hence a unique color. An alternate view factors color counts as A_+·A_− (product of witnesses), which gives the same conclusions and suggests an induction to general d.
