{"summary_md":"In this round we extended tools from the d=2 proof to 3D and identified the remaining gaps. We proved a master multiplicity lemma for the 3D coloring c3 that counts edges of a given type and minima as a sum over E(T)-slices, and derived corollaries: the all-coordinates-changing case equals 1_{m∈U}·|NE3(m)|, and explicit slice formulas for two-changing/one-equal and one-changing/two-equal types. We proved a lexicographic-maximal eligible point yields an antichain NE3(a). Using these tools we completed a rigorous special case: if the projections to x,y,z are injective, then G[U] has a uniquely colored edge. The principal obstruction to lifting the 2D propagation argument is “vertical duplicates” (repeated (x,y) or similar across z) which prevent forcing an r=1 factor in global multiplicities. Plan: formalize topmost-plane propagation, handle duplicates (or trigger |J|=1 uniqueness), prove the 3D “no eligible ⇒ unique” lemma, and complete a 3-way dichotomy + iterative contradiction to finish the proof.","one_line_summary":"Master multiplicity and lex-max antichain established; propagation and duplicates remain","highlights":["Master multiplicity lemma for c3: edge counts = sum_{t∈E(T)} |A_t|·|B_t| (slice decomposition).","Key corollaries: J={x,y,z} gives multiplicity = 1_{m∈U}·|NE3(m)|; explicit formulas for J={x,z} and J={x}.","Lex-maximal eligible point (lex order (z,y,x)) implies NE3(a) is an antichain.","Proved special case: if x,y,z projections are injective on U then a unique color exists.","Main obstacle: vertical/coordinate duplicates across slices prevent forcing r=1 in product multiplicities, blocking 2D-style propagation.","Working plan: formalize plane-wise propagation, design duplicate-avoidance or |J|=1 triggers, prove no-eligible lemma, then a 3-way dichotomy and iteration to contradiction."],"next_questions":["Formalize and prove the topmost-plane propagation lemma that yields an r=1 factor across slices (rigorous (++−) step).","Prove a 3D analogue of “no eligible point ⇒ unique color” using the one-/two-coordinate multiplicity formulas.","Complete the 3-way (x/y/z plane) dichotomy and finish the iterative contradiction handling duplicate-coordinate obstructions." ]}
