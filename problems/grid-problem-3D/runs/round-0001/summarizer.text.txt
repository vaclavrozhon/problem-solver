  "summary_md": "In Round 0003, the focus was on developing a systematic approach to categorize and count edge types based on their sign patterns in three dimensions. The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle was highlighted as a key tool for counting edges sharing the same color, while combinatorial geometry results were noted for their relevance in understanding edge density and color types. A small example with three vertices was analyzed to illustrate the computation of edge colors. However, challenges remain in managing the complexity of sign patterns and ensuring unique edge colors. Next steps include drafting a detailed proof for $d=3$, conducting further examples, and exploring combinatorial bounds.",
