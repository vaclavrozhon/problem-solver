Overall, the slice-based strategy is sound and, with a small refinement, yields a short, fully rigorous proof in 3D.

Prover 1: Your layer-reduction lemma is correct and aligns with the provided d=2 theorem. The “general position” (all coordinates injective) case is handled cleanly by picking the top z-vertex and pairing with a predecessor of maximal x. Your duplicate-color exclusion via the z-entry of the lower corner and maximal-x choice is valid. Note that the complementary case does not require full injectivity in x and y; it suffices that every z-slice has ≤1 point. This allows a simpler argument: choose the top two z-level vertices; their edge has a unique ℓz, hence a unique color.

Prover 2: The slice reduction is fine. Your 3D multiplicity Fact B for a one-odd-coordinate type matches the 2D product-counting logic, but it requires explicitly fixing an orientation representative to ensure the two minima come from different endpoints. Under the coordinate-plane injectivity hypothesis, r·s=1 is immediate. The argument works, but it’s heavier than needed for d=3. Please state clearly the orientation choice in Fact B and the bijection to pairs (v,u) to avoid ambiguity modulo global sign.

Prover 3: This is the cleanest complete solution. The isolation lemma (Tz=0 implies both endpoints have z=t) is immediate, and the lifting from 2D uniqueness to 3D is correct. In the complementary case (each z-slice has ≤1 point), the edge between the two largest z-level vertices has uniquely determined ℓz, ensuring a unique color. This proof is concise and rigorous.

Prover 4: Similar to Prover 2. Your counting facts are plausible; ensure the “one odd coordinate” multiplicity uses a fixed orientation for T and that the two coordinates contributing the minima are on the same endpoint. Again, the slice+top-two approach is simpler for d=3.

Next steps: (i) Formalize the slice-lifting lemma and the top-two-z argument in proofs.md (done below). (ii) Consider extending to general dimension d by induction on the last coordinate using the same split (a slice of size ≥2 reduces to d−1; otherwise, take the top two levels to pin a unique ℓ coordinate).
