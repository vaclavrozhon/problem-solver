  "feedback_md": "Overall: There is solid foundational progress (a correct master multiplicity lemma for c3, its key corollaries, the 3D lex-max antichain, and a nontrivial special case), but no complete 3D analogue of the 2D propagation/dichotomy yet. The main unresolved issue is how to force product counts across z-slices while controlling duplicates and ensuring the r=1 factors needed to invoke (H) imply s\u22652 in a fixed slice.\n\nProver 1: The master multiplicity lemma is correct and very useful; the three explicit corollaries are sound. The 3D lex-max antichain lemma is also correct. The special case for coordinatewise-injective U is rigorously proved and valuable. The proposed plane-based \u201cz-row-good/column-good\u201d framework is on target; the key missing piece is a rigorous selection of the top z-plane and a fixed row \u03b2 that guarantees r_\u03b2(\u03b1,\u03b3\u2032)=1 when pushing down. Your identification of this as the core gap is accurate.\n\nProver 2: The cross-plane propagation lemma as stated needs a correction: you must explicitly choose \u03b4 to be the topmost z-level with NE(a)[z=\u03b4]\u2260\u2205 and \u03b3 the highest lower level. Only then does r_z(\u03b1,\u03b2;\u03b3)=1 hold, and note r_z counts in all of U (not just NE(a)); the topmost/next-lowest choice ensures there is exactly one point with (x,y)=(\u03b1,\u03b2) and z>\u03b3, namely b1 at \u03b4. With that fix, the (++\u2212) product forcing works for one step. Your obstacle example (vertical duplicates) is genuine and shows that naive iteration can stall.\n\nProver 3: The anchored/balanced dictionary and multiplicities are correct and align with Prover 1\u2019s lemma. The slice lifting lemma (anchored type in a single z-slice with isolated base) is correct but relies on a strong isolation hypothesis; we need a mechanism to produce such an isolated base or switch to a balanced |J|=3 trigger.\n\nConcrete next steps:\n- Formalize a plane-based propagation lemma with \u03b4 chosen topmost, \u03b3 the next lower, and an in-plane partially row-good pair b1,b2 at \u03b4. Prove r_\u03b2(x(b1),\u03b3)=1 and force s_\u03b2\u22652 via (H), producing two witnesses on z=\u03b3 at that fixed row \u03b2.\n- Analyze and neutralize vertical duplicates: design a selection rule avoiding (x,y) pairs that recur above \u03b4; if unavoidable, show this forces a |J|=1 unique color on a minimal fiber using the |J|=1 corollary.\n- Prove a 3D \u201cno eligible point \u21d2 unique color\u201d lemma (3D analogue of the 2D endgame) using minimal supporting planes and the |J|=1,2 multiplicity formulas.\n- Establish a 3-way dichotomy (z-/y-/x-plane-good) for a lex-max eligible a, then adapt the final iterative contradiction as in 2D using the cone-lex-max trick.\n\nPlease integrate the validated results (multiplicity lemma, corollaries, lex-max antichain, injective special case) into proofs.md; keep the plane-based propagation in notes until fully rigorous.",

For i\u2208J(T), the color records m_i=min{u_i,v_i}; the coordinates in E(T) are unspecified but equal across the endpoints.\n\nLemma (Master multiplicity for c3). Fix T and m\u2208[n]^{J(T)}. For each t\u2208[n]^{E(T)} define\nA_t={ u\u2208U: u_P=m_P, u_E=t, and u_M>m_M },\nB_t={ v\u2208U: v_M=m_M, v_E=t, and v_P>m_P }.\nThen the number of edges in G[U] with color (T,m) equals \u03a3_{t\u2208[n]^{E(T)}} |A_t|\u00b7|B_t|.\nProof. For any undirected edge {u,v} of color (T,m), orient it so that for i\u2208P(T) we have u_i<v_i and for i\u2208N(T) we have u_i>v_i; for i\u2208E(T) we have u_i=v_i=t_i. By the color definition, for i\u2208P(T) the minimum equals u_i=m_i, and for i\u2208N(T) the minimum equals v_i=m_i. Thus u\u2208A_t and v\u2208B_t for the unique t=u_E=v_E. Conversely any ordered pair (u,v) with u\u2208A_t and v\u2208B_t yields an undirected edge of color (T,m). Because the orientation is fixed by s(T), no undirected edge is counted twice.\u220e\n\nCorollary 1 (All-plus). For J(T)={x,y,z} with P(T)={x,y,z} and N(T)=\u2205, writing m=(\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3) and p=(\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3), the multiplicity equals 1_{p\u2208U}\u00b7|NE3(p)|, where NE3(p)={q\u2208U: q_x>\u03b1, q_y>\u03b2, q_z>\u03b3}.\nProof. Here E(T)=\u2205 and A_t reduces to {p} if p\u2208U and empty otherwise. The set B_t is NE3(p).\n\nCorollary 2 (Two-changing, one equal). For J(T)={x,z}, E(T)={y}, with P(T)={x} and N(T)={z}, and parameters (\u03b1,\u03b3), the multiplicity equals \u03a3_{\u03b2=1}^n r_\u03b2(\u03b1,\u03b3)\u00b7s_\u03b2(\u03b1,\u03b3), where r_\u03b2(\u03b1,\u03b3)= #{(\u03b1,\u03b2,z)\u2208U: z>\u03b3} and s_\u03b2(\u03b1,\u03b3)= #{(x,\u03b2,\u03b3)\u2208U: x>\u03b1}.\nProof. For fixed \u03b2 (i.e., t=\u03b2), A_t are u with (x,y)=(\u03b1,\u03b2) and z>\u03b3; B_t are v with (y,z)=(\u03b2,\u03b3) and x>\u03b1. The claim follows by summing over \u03b2.\n\nCorollary 3 (One-changing, two equal). For J(T)={x}, E(T)={y,z}, and parameter \u03b1, the multiplicity equals \u03a3_{(\u03b2,\u03b3)} 1_{(\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3)\u2208U}\u00b7 #{(x,\u03b2,\u03b3)\u2208U: x>\u03b1}.\nProof. For fixed (\u03b2,\u03b3), A_t is { (\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3) } if present, and B_t are points with y=\u03b2, z=\u03b3, x>\u03b1.\n\nLemma (3D lex-max antichain). Order triples lex by (z,y,x). If a\u2208U is lexicographically maximal among 3D-eligible points (NE3(a)\u2260\u2205), then NE3(q)=\u2205 for every q\u2208NE3(a).\nProof. If q\u2208NE3(a) had NE3(q)\u2260\u2205, pick r\u2208NE3(q). Then (z(r),y(r),x(r))>(z(q),y(q),x(q))>(z(a),y(a),x(a)), so r is eligible and lex-larger than a, contradicting maximality.\n\nTheorem (Coordinatewise-injective U \u21d2 unique color). Suppose U\u2286[n]^3 has injective projections on x, y, and z (no two points share an x, no two share a y, no two share a z), and |U|\u22652. Then G[U] contains an edge whose c3-color is unique in G[U].\nProof. List U as u_1,\u2026,u_m by increasing x. Let y_i=y(u_i), z_i=z(u_i).\nCase 1: (y_i) and (z_i) are strictly increasing in i. Then the product order is a chain. For a=u_{m\u22121} we have NE3(a)={u_m}, so by Corollary 1 the (+++) color with minima (x(a),y(a),z(a)) has multiplicity 1.\nCase 2: Otherwise, there exist i<j with either y_i>y_j and z_i>z_j, or exactly one of these holds.\n- If y_i>y_j and z_i>z_j, consider edge e=u_i u_j with type having P(T)={x}, N(T)={y,z}. Its minima are (x_i,y_j,z_j). Because x is injective, A={u_i}. Because y and z are injective, B={u_j}. By the master lemma, multiplicity is 1.\n- If w.l.o.g. y_i>y_j and z_i<z_j, take type with P(T)={x,z}, N(T)={y} and minima (x_i,y_j,z_i). Injectivity in x and z forces A={u_i}; injectivity in y forces B={u_j}. Multiplicity is 1.\nIn all subcases there is a uniquely colored edge.\u220e"
