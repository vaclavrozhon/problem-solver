  "feedback_md": "Overall, the slice-based strategy is sound and, with a small refinement, yields a short, fully rigorous proof in 3D.\n\nProver 1: Your layer-reduction lemma is correct and aligns with the provided d=2 theorem. The \u201cgeneral position\u201d (all coordinates injective) case is handled cleanly by picking the top z-vertex and pairing with a predecessor of maximal x. Your duplicate-color exclusion via the z-entry of the lower corner and maximal-x choice is valid. Note that the complementary case does not require full injectivity in x and y; it suffices that every z-slice has \u22641 point. This allows a simpler argument: choose the top two z-level vertices; their edge has a unique \u2113z, hence a unique color.\n\nProver 2: The slice reduction is fine. Your 3D multiplicity Fact B for a one-odd-coordinate type matches the 2D product-counting logic, but it requires explicitly fixing an orientation representative to ensure the two minima come from different endpoints. Under the coordinate-plane injectivity hypothesis, r\u00b7s=1 is immediate. The argument works, but it\u2019s heavier than needed for d=3. Please state clearly the orientation choice in Fact B and the bijection to pairs (v,u) to avoid ambiguity modulo global sign.\n\nProver 3: This is the cleanest complete solution. The isolation lemma (Tz=0 implies both endpoints have z=t) is immediate, and the lifting from 2D uniqueness to 3D is correct. In the complementary case (each z-slice has \u22641 point), the edge between the two largest z-level vertices has uniquely determined \u2113z, ensuring a unique color. This proof is concise and rigorous.\n\nProver 4: Similar to Prover 2. Your counting facts are plausible; ensure the \u201cone odd coordinate\u201d multiplicity uses a fixed orientation for T and that the two coordinates contributing the minima are on the same endpoint. Again, the slice+top-two approach is simpler for d=3.\n\nNext steps: (i) Formalize the slice-lifting lemma and the top-two-z argument in proofs.md (done below). (ii) Consider extending to general dimension d by induction on the last coordinate using the same split (a slice of size \u22652 reduces to d\u22121; otherwise, take the top two levels to pin a unique \u2113 coordinate).",
  "summary_md": "Adopt the slice-based proof for d=3: if some z-slice contains \u22652 points, apply the proven d=2 theorem on that slice and note the 3D color remains unique (the z-level is recorded). Otherwise, every z-slice has \u22641 point; the edge between the top two z-level vertices has a uniquely determined \u2113z, hence a unique color. This yields a short, rigorous 3D proof. Heavier product-counting approaches (Provers 2/4) are valid but unnecessary. We add the slice-lifting lemma, the top-two-z lemma, and the main 3D theorem to proofs.md; output.md records the main result.",

The 3D color of the chosen in-slice edge has T_z=0 and records t in \\ell_z, so any edge with the same 3D color must lie in the same slice and have the same 2D color. Hence uniqueness lifts from 2D to 3D.\n\n- Complementary case: If every z-slice contains at most one point of U, list vertices by increasing z: v_1,\\dots,v_m with z_1<\\cdots<z_m. The edge v_{m-1}v_m has \\ell_z=z_{m-1}. No other edge has this \\ell_z value: any edge with \\ell_z=z_{m-1} must use v_{m-1} and a partner above z_{m-1}, which is uniquely v_m. Thus c_3(v_{m-1}v_m) is unique.\n\n- This resolves d=3 without extra counting.

For distinct u=(x_1,y_1,z_1), v=(x_2,y_2,z_2), let \\sigma(u,v)=(sgn(x_1-x_2), sgn(y_1-y_2), sgn(z_1-z_2)) and let the type be T=[\\sigma(u,v)] modulo global sign. Let \\ell(u,v) be the componentwise minimum. The color is c_3(uv)=(T, \\ell(u,v)).\n\nWe use the proven 2D theorem: for the analogous 2D coloring c_2 on [n]^2 (type modulo global sign together with the componentwise minimum that records equalities), every nontrivial induced subgraph contains an edge whose c_2-color is unique within that 2D induced subgraph.\n\nLemma (slice lifting). Fix t\\in[n]. Let U_t=U\\cap\\{(x,y,z): z=t\\}. If an edge e in G[U_t] has a unique 2D color under c_2 (on its (x,y)-projection), then e has a unique color in G[U] under c_3.\nProof. Any edge within z=t has T_z=0 and \\ell_z=t. Conversely, if an edge in G[U] has T_z=0 and \\ell_z=t, its endpoints both lie in z=t (since their z-coordinates are equal to t). For edges inside z=t, c_3 coincides with c_2 on (x,y) together with the recorded z-value t. Thus uniqueness in the slice implies global uniqueness.\n\nLemma (top two z-levels). Suppose every z-slice U_t has size at most 1. Order U by increasing z as v_1,\\dots,v_m with z_1<\\cdots<z_m (m\\ge 2). Then the edge e=v_{m-1}v_m has a unique color under c_3.\nProof. For any edge f, \\ell_z(f)=\\min\\{z(\\text{endpoints of }f)\\}. The only way to have \\ell_z(f)=z_{m-1} is for one endpoint to have z=z_{m-1} and the other to have z>z_{m-1}. Under the assumption that each z-slice contains at most one point, there is exactly one vertex at z=z_{m-1}, namely v_{m-1}, and exactly one vertex above z_{m-1}, namely v_m. Hence the only edge with \\ell_z=z_{m-1} is v_{m-1}v_m. Since c_3 records \\ell, in particular \\ell_z, no other edge can share c_3(e).\n\nTheorem (d=3 unique color). For every U\\subseteq[n]^3 with |U|\\ge 2, the induced graph G[U] contains an edge whose c_3-color appears exactly once in G[U].\nProof. If some z-slice U_t has size at least 2, apply the 2D theorem to the induced 2D graph on U_t to obtain an edge with a unique c_2-color; by the slice-lifting lemma, this edge has a unique c_3-color in G[U]. Otherwise, every z-slice has size at most 1; by the top-two z-levels lemma, the edge between the two highest z-level vertices has a unique c_3-color. In either case, a uniquely colored edge exists.\n\nRemark. The same strategy extends to higher dimensions by induction on the last coordinate: either a (d\u22121)-dimensional slice contains at least two points (reduce to d\u22121), or the edge between the top two levels in the last coordinate has a uniquely determined last-coordinate entry in its lower corner, making its color unique.\n"
