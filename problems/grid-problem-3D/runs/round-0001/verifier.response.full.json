The \u201cgeneral position\u201d (all coordinates injective) case is handled cleanly by picking the top z-vertex and pairing with a predecessor of maximal x. Your duplicate-color exclusion via the z-entry of the lower corner and maximal-x choice is valid. Note that the complementary case does not require full injectivity in x and y; it suffices that every z-slice has \u22641 point. This allows a simpler argument: choose the top two z-level vertices; their edge has a unique \u2113z, hence a unique color.\\n\\nProver 2: The slice reduction is fine. Your 3D multiplicity Fact B for a one-odd-coordinate type matches the 2D product-counting logic, but it requires explicitly fixing an orientation representative to ensure the two minima come from different endpoints. Under the coordinate-plane injectivity hypothesis, r\u00b7s=1 is immediate. The argument works, but it\u2019s heavier than needed for d=3. Please state clearly the orientation choice in Fact B and the bijection to pairs (v,u) to avoid ambiguity modulo global sign.\\n\\nProver 3: This is the cleanest complete solution. The isolation lemma (Tz=0 implies both endpoints have z=t) is immediate, and the lifting from 2D uniqueness to 3D is correct.
