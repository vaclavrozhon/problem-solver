Adopt the slice-based proof for d=3: if some z-slice contains ≥2 points, apply the proven d=2 theorem on that slice and note the 3D color remains unique (the z-level is recorded). Otherwise, every z-slice has ≤1 point; the edge between the top two z-level vertices has a uniquely determined ℓz, hence a unique color. This yields a short, rigorous 3D proof. Heavier product-counting approaches (Provers 2/4) are valid but unnecessary. We add the slice-lifting lemma, the top-two-z lemma, and the main 3D theorem to proofs.md; output.md records the main result.
