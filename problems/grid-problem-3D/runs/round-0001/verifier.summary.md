Validated: a correct master multiplicity lemma for c3 (with key corollaries), a 3D lex-max antichain lemma, and a rigorous special case (coordinatewise-injective U ⇒ unique color). Identified gaps: missing rigorous plane-based propagation/dichotomy; Prover 2’s cross-plane lemma needs δ topmost; vertical duplicates can stall naive iteration; 3D “no eligible ⇒ unique” case remains open. Next: formalize topmost-plane propagation via (++−), craft a selection rule to avoid vertical duplicates or trigger |J|=1 uniqueness, prove the 3D no-eligible lemma, and build a 3-way dichotomy to finish the iteration.
