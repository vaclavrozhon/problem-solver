# Main Results



Main 3D result. For every U⊆[n]^3 with |U|≥2, there exists an edge u1u2 in G[U] whose color under c3 (type modulo global sign together with the full componentwise minimum) appears exactly once in G[U]. The proof splits into: (i) apply the d=2 theorem on any coordinate slice containing ≥2 points (uniqueness lifts since c3 records the fixed coordinate), or (ii) in the coordinatewise-injective case, either a mixed-sign edge has multiplicity 1 by a product count, or U is a chain and a [+++]-type at the penultimate element is unique.

Result (d=3). For every U\subseteq[n]^3 with |U|\ge 2, there exists an edge in G[U] whose color under c_3 (type modulo global sign together with the componentwise minimum, recording equal coordinates) appears exactly once in G[U]. Proof: If some z-slice contains at least two points, apply the 2D theorem on that slice and lift uniqueness to 3D. Otherwise, each z-slice has at most one point, and the edge between the two largest z-level vertices has a uniquely determined z-entry in its lower corner, hence a unique color.
