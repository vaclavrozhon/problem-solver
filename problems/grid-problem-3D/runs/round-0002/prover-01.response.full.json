This makes sense. Now, for \u2113_x and \u2113_y related to edge e, \u2113_x equals the minimum of (x_i, x_m) and \u2113_y equals the minimum of (y_i, y_m).

That rules out duplicates. Alternatively, if x_m > x_i, \u2113_x equals x_i. So for a duplicate pair, x_j must be greater than x_i. The same reasoning applies to y-coordinates.

If there's no second edge with the same 2D color, its 3D color must also be unique because 3D colors rely on more details. Unique 3D colors imply unique 2D colors since they restrict to x/y minima. So, ultimately, the uniqueness in 2D guarantees 3D uniqueness in the z plane, while cross-plane edges can't match due to differing \u2113_z values.\n\nNext, I want to ensure that if no coordinate slice has more than one point, then any fixed coordinate t in U can only have one corresponding point. This means no two points can share the same coordinate across U, establishing that all x, y, and z values remain distinct. Since distinctiveness ensures |U| \u2264 n, it ties back to our unique color edge in general position.\n\nNow, regarding multiplicity, I plan to set up a lemma that counts how many NE_3 successors exist for a point \u03b1 in U. This involves examining the coordinate type behaviors under varying sign patterns while ensuring the orientation from the anchor edge provides useful multiplicity values.

This gets quite intricate! \n\nHowever, the orientation can be standardized, determining the coordinates for each endpoint based on their signs. The number of relevant edges depends on various combinations of coordinate completions.\n\nFor multiplicity, I can express it similar to 2D cases, accounting for both positive and negative components. For example, in 3D cases with a single negative sign, I can define how many positions meet the criteria based on minimum values in relation to the specific coordinates. Under conditions of coordinate-wise injectivity, it turns out that we can confirm that at most one point exists for defined coordinates.\n\nOverall, I've reached a conclusion that reinforces the uniqueness based on my earlier assumptions.

Then either there is a mixed-sign edge, whose color multiplicity factors into two 0\u20131 counts hence equals 1, or all edges are of [+++]-type (a chain), and the edge from the penultimate point has multiplicity 1 by a NE-count.\\n\\nLemma S (slice lifting)\\n\\nStatement. If there exist t\u2208[n] and a coordinate c\u2208{x,y,z} such that |U\u2229{c=t}|\u22652, then G[U] has an edge whose c3-color appears exactly once in G[U].\\n\\nProof. WLOG c=z. Let U_t={ (x,y) : (x,y,t)\u2208U }. By the d=2 theorem, G[U_t] contains an edge e_t with a 2D color unique in G[U_t]. Viewed in 3D, e_t has z\u2208E(T), and c3(e_t) records \u2113_z=t. If an edge e\u2032 in G[U] had c3(e\u2032)=c3(e_t), then T(e\u2032)=T(e_t), so z\u2208E(T(e\u2032)), and \u2113_z(e\u2032)=t. Hence both endpoints of e\u2032 lie in the plane z=t. Within that plane, equality of 3D colors implies equality of the 2D colors (the 3D label refines the 2D label), contradicting the 2D uniqueness of e_t. Thus c3(e_t) is unique in G[U]. \u220e\\n\\nMultiplicity facts in 3D (used in the injective case)\\n\\n- Type [+++]. For \u03b1\u2208[n]^3, the number of edges colored ([+++],\u03b1) equals 1_{\u03b1\u2208U}\u00b7|NE_3(\u03b1)|, where NE_3(\u03b1)={q\u2208U: q_x>\u03b1_x, q_y>\u03b1_y, q_z>\u03b1_z}.\\n- Type with one negative sign, e.g. [+,+,\u2212]. For \u03b1\u2208[n]^3, define\\n  r_{xy}(\u03b1)=|{ p\u2208U: p_x=\u03b1_x, p_y=\u03b1_y, p_z>\u03b1_z }|,\\n  s_{xy}(\u03b1)=|{ q\u2208U: q_x>\u03b1_x, q_y>\u03b1_y, q_z=\u03b1_z }|.\\n  Then the number of edges colored ([+,+,\u2212],\u03b1) equals r_{xy}(\u03b1)\u00b7s_{xy}(\u03b1). Proof: every such edge is uniquely represented as an ordered pair (p,q) with p as above and q as above; conversely any such (p,q) yields color ([+,+,\u2212],\u03b1).\\n- The analogous factorization holds for any fixed sign pattern on {x,y,z} with E(T)=\u2205 (two negatives swap roles of coordinates accordingly).\\n\\nLemma GP (general-position uniqueness)\\n\\nStatement. Suppose U\u2286[n]^3 is coordinatewise-injective: distinct points have distinct x-, y-, and z-coordinates. Then G[U] contains an edge with a unique c3-color.\\n\\nProof. Order U by increasing z: v_1,\u2026,v_m with z_1<\u22ef<z_m, m\u22652. Let v_m be top-z, and choose v_i among {v_1,\u2026,v_{m-1}} with maximal x (uniquely determined by injectivity). Consider e={v_i,v_m}.\\n\\nAny edge having the same color as e must match \u2113(e). Since z\u2019s are all distinct, \u2113_z(e)=z_i forces the lower endpoint in z to have z=z_i; hence any duplicate must be {v_i,v_j} with j>i. Compare \u2113_x and \u2113_y:\\n- If x_m<x_i, then \u2113_x(e)=x_m. Injectivity gives no j with x_j=x_m, so no duplicate.\\n- If y_m<y_i, then \u2113_y(e)=y_m, and similarly no duplicate exists.\\n- If x_m>x_i and y_m>y_i, then \u2113_x(e)=x_i and \u2113_y(e)=y_i. A duplicate {v_i,v_j} would require x_j>x_i and y_j>y_i. But v_i was chosen with maximal x among j<m, hence no such j<m. Thus no duplicate.\\nIn all cases c3(e) is unique. \u220e\\n\\nCorollary (mixed-sign uniqueness under injectivity). If U is coordinatewise-injective and admits any edge of mixed-sign type (i.e., not [+++]), then some realized color has multiplicity 1. Proof: use the r\u00b7s factorization above. Under injectivity, both factors are \u22641, and for a realized color both are 1, hence multiplicity 1.\\n\\nChain alternative. If U is coordinatewise-injective and has no mixed-sign edge, then U is a chain in the product order: sorting by z increases x and y as well. Then the [+++]-color at the penultimate vertex \u03b1 has |NE_3(\u03b1)|=1, yielding a unique color.\\n\\nTheorem (3D uniqueness). For every U\u2286[n]^3 with |U|\u22652, there exist u_1,u_2\u2208U such that u_1u_2 has a c3-color that appears exactly once in G[U].\\n\\nProof. If some coordinate slice has \u22652 points, apply Lemma S. Otherwise U is coordinatewise-injective; apply Lemma GP (or the mixed-sign/chain dichotomy). \u220e\\n\\nExamples\\n\\n- U={(1,1,1),(2,3,4)}: single edge, unique color.\\n- U={(1,1,2),(2,3,1),(3,2,3)} (injective, mixed signs abound). Any realized [+,+,\u2212]-color has multiplicity 1 by r\u00b7s=1.\\n- U={(1,1,1),(2,2,2),(3,3,3)} (injective chain). At \u03b1=(2,2,2), |NE_3(\u03b1)|=1, so ([+++],\u03b1) is unique.\\n- Slice: U contains two points at z=5. The 2D theorem gives a unique color within z=5; c3 records z=5, so no other edge matches it globally.\\n\\nObstacles/Checks\\n\\n- Potential pitfall: confusing 2D vs 3D colors on a slice. Addressed: equality of 3D colors implies equality of the induced 2D colors; since 2D color is unique within the slice, no collision occurs.\\n- In the injective case, uniqueness was shown by ruling out matching \u2113; T matching is not needed once \u2113 mismatch is established.\\n\\nNext steps\\n\\n- d-dimensional induction. Either a (d\u22121)-dimensional hyperplane slice has \u22652 points (reduce to d\u22121), or the set is coordinatewise-injective. For any mixed-sign type T, define P(T),N(T),E(T). With \u2113 fixed, multiplicity equals R_T(\u2113)\u00b7S_T(\u2113), where R fixes \u2113 on P\u222aE and goes up on N, S fixes \u2113 on N\u222aE and goes up on P. Under injectivity, R,S\u22641; any realized mixed-sign color has multiplicity 1. If no mixed-sign edges exist, U is a chain and a [+,\u2026, +]-type at the penultimate element is unique. Formalizing this yields a clean proof for all d. \"}",
