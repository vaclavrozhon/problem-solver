An edge with unique 2D color lifts to a unique 3D color because c_3 remembers T with T_z=0 and the equal coordinate \u2113_z=t; no edge off the slice can share T_z=0.\n- Complementary case: If every z-slice contains \u22641 point, let u be the unique point with maximum z, and let v be the unique point with second maximum z. The edge uv has \u2113_z=z(v). Any edge with the same \u2113_z must involve v and a vertex w with z(w)>z(v); but u is the only such vertex. Hence c_3(uv) is unique.\n\nLemma 1 (slice lifting)\nLet t\u2208[n] and U_t={(x,y):(x,y,t)\u2208U}. If an edge e in G[U_t] has a unique color under the 2D coloring (from the provided d=2 theorem), then the corresponding 3D edge has a unique color under c_3 in G[U].\nProof. For an edge e within z=t, c_3(e)=(T_3,\u2113_3) has T_3 with T_{3,z}=0 and \u2113_{3,z}=t. Any edge e\u2032 not in the plane has T_{3,z}\u22600, so c_3(e\u2032)\u2260c_3(e). For edges e\u2032 within z=t, equality c_3(e\u2032)=c_3(e) forces equality of the projected 2D type and 2D lower corner, hence equality of the 2D colors. Uniqueness in the plane implies uniqueness globally.\n\nLemma 2 (top-two z-level uniqueness)\nAssume each z-slice contains \u22641 point of U and |U|\u22652. Let u be the unique point of U with maximal z, and v the unique point with second maximal z. Then c_3(uv) is unique in G[U].\nProof. Let e=uv. Then \u2113_z(e)=z(v). If e\u2032 is any edge with c_3(e\u2032)=c_3(e), then \u2113_z(e\u2032)=z(v). Thus one endpoint of e\u2032 must have z=z(v) and the other z\u2265z(v). Because every z-slice has \u22641 point and z(u) is maximal, the only vertex with z>z(v) is u. Hence e\u2032 is the same unordered pair {u,v}. Therefore the color is unique.\n\nTheorem (3D unique color under c_3)\nFor every U\u2282[n]^3 with |U|\u22652, there exists an edge of G[U] whose c_3-color appears exactly once in G[U].\nProof. If some z-slice U_t has \u22652 points, apply the d=2 theorem to G[U_t] and lift by Lemma 1. Otherwise every z-slice has \u22641 point; then Lemma 2 applies and yields a unique color on the edge between the top two z-level points. (By symmetry, one could start with any coordinate.)\n\nExamples (sanity checks)\n- Slice case: U\u2229{z=5} contains {(1,1,5),(3,2,5),(4,4,5)}. The 2D theorem yields an in-plane edge with unique 2D color; its 3D color has T_z=0, \u2113_z=5 and is unique globally.\n- Sparse slices: U={(1,1,1),(3,2,2),(2,5,7)}. Each z-slice has \u22641 point. The edge between z=7 and z=2 has \u2113_z=2, and is the only edge with that \u2113_z, hence unique.\n\nObstacles\n- None substantive for d=3; the slice-lift and top-two argument avoid heavier counting. Care only that c_3 stores T_z and \u2113_z, which it does by definition.\n\nNext steps\n- Extend to general dimension d by the same dichotomy: either a (d\u22121)-dimensional slice contains \u22652 points (reduce and lift), or every last-coordinate slice has \u22641 point and the edge between the top two levels has a unique last-coordinate entry in its lower corner, hence a unique color. Formalize the slice-lift lemma and the two-level argument in dimension d with c_d recording T and the full \u2113.\n"
