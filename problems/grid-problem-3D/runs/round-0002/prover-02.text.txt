Ideas
- Slice-lift: If a coordinate plane (say z=t) contains ≥2 points of U, apply the proven d=2 theorem to the 2D set U_t={(x,y):(x,y,t)∈U}. An edge with unique 2D color lifts to a unique 3D color because c_3 remembers T with T_z=0 and the equal coordinate ℓ_z=t; no edge off the slice can share T_z=0.
- Complementary case: If every z-slice contains ≤1 point, let u be the unique point with maximum z, and let v be the unique point with second maximum z. The edge uv has ℓ_z=z(v). Any edge with the same ℓ_z must involve v and a vertex w with z(w)>z(v); but u is the only such vertex. Hence c_3(uv) is unique.

Lemma 1 (slice lifting)
Let t∈[n] and U_t={(x,y):(x,y,t)∈U}. If an edge e in G[U_t] has a unique color under the 2D coloring (from the provided d=2 theorem), then the corresponding 3D edge has a unique color under c_3 in G[U].
Proof. For an edge e within z=t, c_3(e)=(T_3,ℓ_3) has T_3 with T_{3,z}=0 and ℓ_{3,z}=t. Any edge e′ not in the plane has T_{3,z}≠0, so c_3(e′)≠c_3(e). For edges e′ within z=t, equality c_3(e′)=c_3(e) forces equality of the projected 2D type and 2D lower corner, hence equality of the 2D colors. Uniqueness in the plane implies uniqueness globally.

Lemma 2 (top-two z-level uniqueness)
Assume each z-slice contains ≤1 point of U and |U|≥2. Let u be the unique point of U with maximal z, and v the unique point with second maximal z. Then c_3(uv) is unique in G[U].
Proof. Let e=uv. Then ℓ_z(e)=z(v). If e′ is any edge with c_3(e′)=c_3(e), then ℓ_z(e′)=z(v). Thus one endpoint of e′ must have z=z(v) and the other z≥z(v). Because every z-slice has ≤1 point and z(u) is maximal, the only vertex with z>z(v) is u. Hence e′ is the same unordered pair {u,v}. Therefore the color is unique.

Theorem (3D unique color under c_3)
For every U⊂[n]^3 with |U|≥2, there exists an edge of G[U] whose c_3-color appears exactly once in G[U].
Proof. If some z-slice U_t has ≥2 points, apply the d=2 theorem to G[U_t] and lift by Lemma 1. Otherwise every z-slice has ≤1 point; then Lemma 2 applies and yields a unique color on the edge between the top two z-level points. (By symmetry, one could start with any coordinate.)

Examples (sanity checks)
- Slice case: U∩{z=5} contains {(1,1,5),(3,2,5),(4,4,5)}. The 2D theorem yields an in-plane edge with unique 2D color; its 3D color has T_z=0, ℓ_z=5 and is unique globally.
- Sparse slices: U={(1,1,1),(3,2,2),(2,5,7)}. Each z-slice has ≤1 point. The edge between z=7 and z=2 has ℓ_z=2, and is the only edge with that ℓ_z, hence unique.

Obstacles
- None substantive for d=3; the slice-lift and top-two argument avoid heavier counting. Care only that c_3 stores T_z and ℓ_z, which it does by definition.

Next steps
- Extend to general dimension d by the same dichotomy: either a (d−1)-dimensional slice contains ≥2 points (reduce and lift), or every last-coordinate slice has ≤1 point and the edge between the top two levels has a unique last-coordinate entry in its lower corner, hence a unique color. Formalize the slice-lift lemma and the two-level argument in dimension d with c_d recording T and the full ℓ.
