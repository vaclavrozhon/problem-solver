Even if 2D color isn't unique, the 3D color could be due to the inclusion of one coordinate (\u03b1). We have to verify that this unique edge from 2D also leads to 3D uniqueness, which is safe because edges in the slice can't share the same 3D color.  \n\nNow, moving to the multiplicity formula: we see how position counts (A_+, A_-) depend on orientation, checking independence by swapping roles. I aim to create rigorous statements and examples for clarity.

The number of edges e in G[U] with c_3(e)=(T,\u2113) equals A_+(T,\u2113)\u00b7A_\u2212(T,\u2113). The product is independent of the choice of representative s (flipping s\u21a6\u2212s swaps A_+ and A_\u2212).\\n\\nProof. Orient an edge {u,v} to an ordered pair (u\u2192v) so that for each i\u2208J(T), the sign of v_i\u2212u_i equals s_i (if s_i=+ then v_i>u_i; if s_i=\u2212 then u_i>v_i); for i\u2208E(T) we have u_i=v_i=\u2113_i. Then \u2113(u,v)=\u2113 and u, v satisfy the defining constraints of A_\u2212 and A_+, respectively. Conversely, any u counted by A_\u2212 and v counted by A_+ form an oriented edge with type T and lower corner \u2113. This is a bijection between oriented edges with color (T,\u2113) and A_\u2212\u00d7A_+, hence the number of unordered edges is A_+\u00b7A_\u2212 (each unordered edge admits exactly one orientation matching the fixed s). Changing s flips the roles, preserving the product.\\n\\nUseful specializations (for checks):\\n- T=[+,+,+]: multiplicity = 1_{\u2113\u2208U}\u00b7|{v\u2208U: v_x>\u2113_x, v_y>\u2113_y, v_z>\u2113_z}|.\\n- T=[+,-,0]: multiplicity = r(\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3)\u00b7s(\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3) with r= #{(\u03b1,y,\u03b3)\u2208U: y>\u03b2}, s= #{(x,\u03b2,\u03b3)\u2208U: x>\u03b1}.\\n- T=[+,0,0]: multiplicity = 1_{(\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3)\u2208U}\u00b7#{(x,\u03b2,\u03b3)\u2208U: x>\u03b1}. Symmetric variants are analogous.\\n\\n# Slice-lifting lemma\\nLemma (slice\u2192global). Fix a coordinate, say z. If a slice U_\u03b3:=U\u2229{z=\u03b3} has |U_\u03b3|\u22652 and G[U_\u03b3] contains an edge whose color is unique under the d=2 coloring on (x,y), then G[U] contains an edge whose color under c_3 is unique.\\n\\nProof. Any edge inside U_\u03b3 has E(T)\u2287{z} and \u2113_z=\u03b3 for c_3. If e on U_\u03b3 has unique 2D color (type on x,y with appropriate minima), then there is no other edge inside U_\u03b3 with the same (T restricted to x,y, \u2113_x,\u2113_y). Consequently no other edge inside U_\u03b3 has the same c_3 color (T,\u2113_x,\u2113_y,\u2113_z=\u03b3). No edge outside U_\u03b3 can share this c_3 label because \u2113_z appears and must equal \u03b3 while E(T) includes z; thus both endpoints would have z=\u03b3 and lie in U_\u03b3. Hence the color is unique in G[U].\\n\\n# Coordinatewise-injective case\\nAssume every coordinate slice has size at most 1: for all \u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3, we have |U[x=\u03b1]|,|U[y=\u03b2]|,|U[z=\u03b3]|\u22641. Equivalently, no two points in U agree in any coordinate.\\n\\nLemma (mixed-sign edges are unique). Let e have type T with J(T)={x,y,z} and with both + and \u2212 appearing in any representative s (i.e., T is not [+++] modulo sign). Then c_3(e) has multiplicity 1 in G[U].\\n\\nProof. By multiplicity, A_\u2212 counts u with u_i=\u2113_i for each i with s_i=+ and u_i>\u2113_i for each i with s_i=\u2212; in particular, u_i is fixed to \u2113_i on at least one coordinate, so by injectivity there is at most one such u. Since e realizes the color, A_\u2212=1. Similarly A_+ fixes v_i=\u2113_i on all s_i=\u2212 and v_i>\u2113_i on s_i=+, again at most one v and realized, so A_+=1. Thus the multiplicity is 1.\\n\\nLemma (no mixed sign \u21d2 chain \u21d2 unique [+++]). If every edge of G[U] has type [+++] modulo sign, then U is totally ordered by the product order: after relabeling p_1\u227ap_2\u227a\u22ef\u227ap_k (coordinatewise increasing). Then for \u2113=p_{k\u22121}, the [+++]-color has multiplicity 1.\\n\\nProof. If some pair were incomparable, their sign pattern would mix + and \u2212, contradiction. In a chain, the strict NE set of p_{k\u22121} is {p_k} and the [+++]-multiplicity specializes to 1_{\u2113\u2208U}\u00b7|NE(p_{k\u22121})|=1.\\n\\n# Main theorem in 3D\\nTheorem. For every U\u2286[n]^3 with |U|\u22652, there exists an edge in G[U] whose color under c_3 appears exactly once in G[U].\\n\\nProof. If some slice U_\u03b3 has size \u22652, apply the d=2 theorem to G[U_\u03b3]; the slice-lifting lemma gives a globally unique color. Otherwise, U is coordinatewise-injective. If a mixed-sign edge exists, it is unique by the mixed-sign lemma. If not, U is a chain and the [+++]-edge from the penultimate element is unique. Hence in all cases a unique color exists.\\n\\n# Extension to general dimension d (outline with key lemmas)\\nDefine c_d on [n]^d by c_d(uv)=(T(e),\u2113(u,v)), where T is the sign pattern in {\u22121,0,+1}^d modulo global sign and \u2113 the componentwise minimum. The 3D multiplicity lemma generalizes verbatim: choose a representative s, define A_\u00b1 analogously, and obtain multiplicity = A_+\u00b7A_\u2212 (proof identical). Induction on d\u22652:\\n- Base d=2 is given.\\n- Step d\u2192d+1: If a coordinate slice has \u22652 points, apply the induction hypothesis to that (d)-dimensional slice; the color lifts because c_{d+1} records \u2113_i for the equal coordinate and E(T) includes it. Otherwise, U is injective in each coordinate. If some edge has mixed signs (both + and \u2212) in its type, multiplicity is 1 by the A_+\u00b7A_\u2212 argument. If not, U is a chain in the product order and the [+,\u2026, +]-edge from the penultimate element has multiplicity 1. Thus the theorem holds in dimension d+1.\\n\\n# Examples\\n- Slice case: U contains (2,3,5),(4,1,5),(3,4,5). Apply d=2 theorem on z=5 slice; the obtained unique 2D color lifts to a unique c_3 color globally.\\n- Injective mixed: U={(1,5,7),(4,2,6)} yields a [+,\u2212,\u2212]-type; A_+=A_\u2212=1, multiplicity 1.\\n- Injective chain: U={(1,1,1),(3,3,3),(6,6,6)}; the edge from (3,3,3) to (6,6,6) has unique [+++]-color.\\n\\n# Obstacles / checks\\n- The lifting relies crucially on c_d remembering equal coordinates via E(T) and \u2113; without this, slice-uniqueness could be destroyed by edges off the slice.\\n- Independence of the multiplicity count from the representative s is addressed by the oriented-edge bijection.\\n\\n# Next steps\\n- Consolidate a formal write-up for d=3 in proofs.md using the multiplicity lemma and slice-lifting.\\n- State and prove the full d-dimensional theorem via induction as outlined.\\n- Quantitative: lower bounds on the number of unique colors in terms of |U|, and extremal constructions minimizing unique colors.\"}",
