The 3D color c_3 remembers that z is equal (z\u2208E(T)) and records z=t in \u2113, so uniqueness in the slice lifts to uniqueness in G[U].\n- Otherwise, each z-slice contains \u22641 point. Order U by z and take the two top z-level vertices p (second highest) and q (highest). Then \u2113_z(p,q)=z(p) is a value that no other edge can realize, hence c_3(pq) is unique.\n\n# Slice\u2013lifting lemma (rigorous)\nLemma (slice lifting). Fix t\u2208[n] and let U_z[t]=U\u2229{(x,y,z): z=t}. If |U_z[t]|\u22652, then G[U] contains an edge whose c_3\u2013color is unique in G[U].\n\nProof. Consider the induced subgraph G[U_z[t]] inside the z=t plane. Identify points with their (x,y)-coordinates. Apply the d=2 theorem to get an edge e\u2032 in G[U_z[t]] whose 2D color is unique within G[U_z[t]]. For any in-slice edge e, its 3D type T has z\u2208E(T) (the z\u2013difference is 0), and c_3(e)=(T,\u2113) records \u2113_z=t and the 2D lower corner on (x,y). Hence two in-slice edges share the same 3D color iff they share the same 2D color. Therefore c_3(e\u2032) is unique among in-slice edges.\nIf an edge f outside the slice had c_3(f)=c_3(e\u2032), then its type would also have z\u2208E(T) (because E(T) is part of the label T modulo sign), which is impossible since z(f) differs on its endpoints. Thus no outside edge can share the color. Hence c_3(e\u2032) is unique in G[U]. \u220e\n\n# Top-two\u2013levels lemma (complementary case)\nLemma (top two z\u2013levels). If |U|\u22652 and every z-slice contains \u22641 point of U, then G[U] has a uniquely colored edge.\n\nProof. Let the distinct z\u2013values realized by U be z_1<\u22ef<z_m (m=|U|) and pick p,q\u2208U with z(p)=z_{m-1}, z(q)=z_m. Consider e=pq. For any edge f=uv with c_3(f)=c_3(e), we must have the same type T and the same lower corner \u2113. In particular \u2113_z(f)=\u2113_z(e)=z(p). Hence one endpoint of f has z=z(p) and the other has z>z(p). Because by assumption each z\u2013level holds \u22641 point, the unique vertex with z=z(p) is p, and since z_{m-1} is the second highest level, the unique vertex with z>z(p) is q. Therefore f=pq. Thus c_3(pq) is unique. \u220e\n\n# Main theorem (d=3)\nTheorem. For every U\u2286[n]^3 with |U|\u22652, there exists an edge in G[U] whose color under c_3 appears exactly once in G[U].\n\nProof. If some z-slice U_z[t] has size \u22652, apply the slice\u2013lifting lemma. Otherwise, every z-slice has size \u22641 and the top-two\u2013levels lemma applies. \u220e\n\n# Examples (sanity checks)\n- Slice case: U={ (1,1,1),(3,2,1),(2,1,2) }. In z=1 plane there are two points; the d=2 theorem yields a unique edge there, which is unique in 3D since T has z\u2208E(T).\n- No-slice case: U={ (1,1,1),(2,3,2),(3,2,3) }. The two highest z\u2013levels are 2 and 3 with vertices (2,3,2),(3,2,3); their edge has \u2113_z=2. No other edge has \u2113_z=2, hence its color is unique.\n\n# Obstacles\n- None substantial in d=3: the color includes E(T) (the identity of zero coordinates) and the full \u2113, so cross-slice collisions are excluded.\n\n# Next steps\n- Generalize to d\u22653: either a (d\u22121)-dimensional slice along the last coordinate has \u22652 points (reduce to the known (d\u22121) theorem and lift), or every slice has \u22641 point, in which case the edge between the top two levels has a unique \u2113 in the last coordinate, yielding uniqueness exactly as above. Formalizing this gives an induction proof for all d with the same coloring scheme c_d.\n"
