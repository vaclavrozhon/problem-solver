# Ideas
- Use a slice–lifting step: if some z-slice U_z[t]=U∩{z=t} contains ≥2 points, apply the proved d=2 theorem on that slice. The 3D color c_3 remembers that z is equal (z∈E(T)) and records z=t in ℓ, so uniqueness in the slice lifts to uniqueness in G[U].
- Otherwise, each z-slice contains ≤1 point. Order U by z and take the two top z-level vertices p (second highest) and q (highest). Then ℓ_z(p,q)=z(p) is a value that no other edge can realize, hence c_3(pq) is unique.

# Slice–lifting lemma (rigorous)
Lemma (slice lifting). Fix t∈[n] and let U_z[t]=U∩{(x,y,z): z=t}. If |U_z[t]|≥2, then G[U] contains an edge whose c_3–color is unique in G[U].

Proof. Consider the induced subgraph G[U_z[t]] inside the z=t plane. Identify points with their (x,y)-coordinates. Apply the d=2 theorem to get an edge e′ in G[U_z[t]] whose 2D color is unique within G[U_z[t]]. For any in-slice edge e, its 3D type T has z∈E(T) (the z–difference is 0), and c_3(e)=(T,ℓ) records ℓ_z=t and the 2D lower corner on (x,y). Hence two in-slice edges share the same 3D color iff they share the same 2D color. Therefore c_3(e′) is unique among in-slice edges.
If an edge f outside the slice had c_3(f)=c_3(e′), then its type would also have z∈E(T) (because E(T) is part of the label T modulo sign), which is impossible since z(f) differs on its endpoints. Thus no outside edge can share the color. Hence c_3(e′) is unique in G[U]. ∎

# Top-two–levels lemma (complementary case)
Lemma (top two z–levels). If |U|≥2 and every z-slice contains ≤1 point of U, then G[U] has a uniquely colored edge.

Proof. Let the distinct z–values realized by U be z_1<⋯<z_m (m=|U|) and pick p,q∈U with z(p)=z_{m-1}, z(q)=z_m. Consider e=pq. For any edge f=uv with c_3(f)=c_3(e), we must have the same type T and the same lower corner ℓ. In particular ℓ_z(f)=ℓ_z(e)=z(p). Hence one endpoint of f has z=z(p) and the other has z>z(p). Because by assumption each z–level holds ≤1 point, the unique vertex with z=z(p) is p, and since z_{m-1} is the second highest level, the unique vertex with z>z(p) is q. Therefore f=pq. Thus c_3(pq) is unique. ∎

# Main theorem (d=3)
Theorem. For every U⊆[n]^3 with |U|≥2, there exists an edge in G[U] whose color under c_3 appears exactly once in G[U].

Proof. If some z-slice U_z[t] has size ≥2, apply the slice–lifting lemma. Otherwise, every z-slice has size ≤1 and the top-two–levels lemma applies. ∎

# Examples (sanity checks)
- Slice case: U={ (1,1,1),(3,2,1),(2,1,2) }. In z=1 plane there are two points; the d=2 theorem yields a unique edge there, which is unique in 3D since T has z∈E(T).
- No-slice case: U={ (1,1,1),(2,3,2),(3,2,3) }. The two highest z–levels are 2 and 3 with vertices (2,3,2),(3,2,3); their edge has ℓ_z=2. No other edge has ℓ_z=2, hence its color is unique.

# Obstacles
- None substantial in d=3: the color includes E(T) (the identity of zero coordinates) and the full ℓ, so cross-slice collisions are excluded.

# Next steps
- Generalize to d≥3: either a (d−1)-dimensional slice along the last coordinate has ≥2 points (reduce to the known (d−1) theorem and lift), or every slice has ≤1 point, in which case the edge between the top two levels has a unique ℓ in the last coordinate, yielding uniqueness exactly as above. Formalizing this gives an induction proof for all d with the same coloring scheme c_d.
