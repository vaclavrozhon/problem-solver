  "summary_md": "Result for d=3: For every U\u2286[n]^3 with |U|\u22652 there is an edge of G[U] whose c_3-color appears exactly once. Proof splits on a coordinate (wlog z): (i) If some z-slice U\u2229{z=t} has \u22652 points, apply the provided d=2 theorem on that slice; since c_3 records the equal coordinate (\u2113_z=t and z\u2208E(T)), in-slice uniqueness lifts to the whole set. (ii) Otherwise every z-slice has \u22641 point; order points by z and the edge between the top two z-levels has a uniquely determined \u2113_z, hence a unique c_3-color. An alternative counting viewpoint factors multiplicities as A_+\u00b7A_\u2212 for fixed (T,\u2113), which handles mixed-sign/injective cases and yields the same conclusions; this extends by induction to higher d.

    "Complementary case: if every slice has \u22641 point, the edge joining the two highest levels has unique \u2113 in that coordinate, so its color is unique.",
    "Multiplicity factorization: for fixed type T and lower corner \u2113 the count equals A_+(T,\u2113)\u00b7A_\u2212(T,\u2113); under slice-injectivity this forces multiplicity 1 for realized mixed-sign edges.",
    "The argument gives a clear inductive template to extend the result to general dimension d by reducing to a (d\u22121)-slice or using the top-two-level argument."
