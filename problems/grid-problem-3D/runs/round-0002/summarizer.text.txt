{"summary_md":"Result for d=3: For every U⊆[n]^3 with |U|≥2 there is an edge of G[U] whose c_3-color appears exactly once. Proof splits on a coordinate (wlog z): (i) If some z-slice U∩{z=t} has ≥2 points, apply the provided d=2 theorem on that slice; since c_3 records the equal coordinate (ℓ_z=t and z∈E(T)), in-slice uniqueness lifts to the whole set. (ii) Otherwise every z-slice has ≤1 point; order points by z and the edge between the top two z-levels has a uniquely determined ℓ_z, hence a unique c_3-color. An alternative counting viewpoint factors multiplicities as A_+·A_− for fixed (T,ℓ), which handles mixed-sign/injective cases and yields the same conclusions; this extends by induction to higher d.
