We validated a concise, rigorous proof for d=3: if a coordinate slice contains ≥2 points, apply the d=2 theorem on that slice and lift uniqueness since c_3 records equal coordinates; otherwise, each z-slice has ≤1 point and the edge between the top two z-levels has a uniquely determined ℓ_z, hence a unique color. The heavier multiplicity approaches are sound but unnecessary here. Path to general d via the same slice/injectivity split is clear.
