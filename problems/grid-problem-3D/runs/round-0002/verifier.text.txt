{"feedback_md":"All four provers converged on a correct and clean strategy for d=3: (i) use the given d=2 theorem on any coordinate slice containing at least two points, and (ii) otherwise, exploit the fact that c_3 records the equal coordinate and the full lower corner ℓ to certify uniqueness via the top two levels of a coordinate. The key observation is that if every z-slice has ≤1 point, then the edge between the unique vertices at the two largest realized z-levels is the only edge with ℓ_z equal to the second-largest z-value, hence its color is unique.\n\nProver 1: Your layer-reduction lemma is correct. The general-position case (all coordinates distinct) argument via choosing the top z-vertex and the maximal-x predecessor is valid and proves uniqueness by excluding potential duplicates through ℓ comparisons. For d=3, this can be streamlined: it suffices that each z-slice has ≤1 point; then the top-two z-level argument yields uniqueness without extra casework on x,y.\n\nProver 2: The slice-lift is correctly formulated. Your multiplicity r·s for a one-odd-coordinate type is fine conceptually, but be explicit about fixing an orientation representative for T (modulo sign) to avoid ambiguity; under coordinate-plane injectivity, both factors are indeed ≤1 and equal 1 for a realized color. For d=3 this is heavier than needed but sound.\n\nProver 3: The general multiplicity product A_+·A_- is well-stated and the independence from the representative sign follows from the oriented-edge bijection. This provides a robust framework and a clear path to a d-dimensional induction. For the current d=3 goal, the simpler slice + top-two proof already suffices.\n\nProver 4: Your presentation matches the simplest correct proof: slice-lifting plus the top-two z-levels lemma. The isolation by E(T) and ℓ_z is the essential point.\n\nNext steps: (1) Generalize to dimension d by induction on the last coordinate using the same dichotomy (slice with ≥2 points or top-two levels). (2) Formalize the A_+·A_- multiplicity in general d to handle mixed-sign types cleanly. (3) Explore quantitative bounds: minimal number of unique colors as a function of |U|, and extremal configurations.\n","summary_md":"We validated a concise, rigorous proof for d=3: if a coordinate slice contains ≥2 points, apply the d=2 theorem on that slice and lift uniqueness since c_3 records equal coordinates; otherwise, each z-slice has ≤1 point and the edge between the top two z-levels has a uniquely determined ℓ_z, hence a unique color. The heavier multiplicity approaches are sound but unnecessary here.
