  "content": "Ideas\n\n- Use a clean two-case split: either a coordinate slice contains at least two points (reduce to the given d=2 theorem), or every slice along some coordinate has size \u22641 (then an edge between the top two levels in that coordinate has a unique c3-color).\n- Record a precise \u201cslice lifting\u201d lemma that formalizes how uniqueness in a 2D slice implies uniqueness in the full 3D graph, because c3 remembers equal coordinates and their values.\n- Record a \u201ctop-two-levels\u201d lemma for the injective-in-that-coordinate case; its proof isolates c3 by the \u2113-coordinate at that axis.\n\nLemma 1 (Slice lifting)\n\nStatement. Fix c\u2208{x,y,z} and t\u2208[n]. Let U_t=U\u2229{c=t}. If |U_t|\u22652 and there is an edge e within the slice {c=t} whose 2D color (under the d=2 map of the provided theorem) is unique inside G[U_t], then c3(e) appears exactly once in G[U].\n\nProof. WLOG c=z. For edges within z=t, c3 equals (T,\u2113) with z\u2208E(T) and \u2113_z=t. If some e\u2032 in G[U] had c3(e\u2032)=c3(e), then z\u2208E(T(e\u2032)) and \u2113_z(e\u2032)=t, so e\u2032 also lies in the plane z=t. Moreover, equality of 3D labels implies equality of the induced 2D labels on that plane (c3 refines the 2D label: equality of c3 forces equality of type on x,y and of the 2D lower-corner entries). This contradicts the 2D uniqueness of e in G[U_t]. Thus c3(e) is unique in G[U]. \u220e\n\nRemark (refinement vs. restriction). On a fixed slice, define the map \u03c0 that forgets the z-entry and the \u201cz=0\u201d annotation of T from c3. Then \u03c0(c3(e)) equals the 2D color of e used in the d=2 theorem. Hence c3-equality implies 2D-color equality.\n\nLemma 2 (Top two levels give uniqueness when slices are singletons)\n\nStatement. Suppose every z-slice contains at most one point of U. List U by increasing z as v_1,\u2026,v_m with z_1<\u22ef<z_m (m\u22652). Then the edge e=v_{m-1}v_m has a c3-color that appears exactly once in G[U].\n\nProof. Let e={v_{m-1},v_m}. Any edge e\u2032 with c3(e\u2032)=c3(e) must match \u2113_z(e\u2032)=\u2113_z(e)=z_{m-1}. For an undirected edge, \u2113_z equals the smaller z-coordinate among its endpoints; thus one endpoint of e\u2032 must have z=z_{m-1} and the other must have z>z_{m-1}. By assumption, the only vertex with z=z_{m-1} is v_{m-1}, and the only vertex with z>z_{m-1} is v_m. Hence e\u2032=e. Therefore c3(e) is unique. \u220e\n\nTheorem (3D uniqueness of a color under c3)\n\nStatement. For every U\u2286[n]^3 with |U|\u22652, there exist u_1,u_2\u2208U such that the edge u_1u_2 has a color that appears exactly once in G[U] under c3.\n\nProof. If some z-slice U_t has |U_t|\u22652, the d=2 theorem on that slice yields an edge with a unique 2D color in G[U_t], and Lemma 1 lifts it to a unique color in G[U]. Otherwise, every z-slice has size \u22641; then Lemma 2 applied to z gives a unique c3-color. \u220e\n\nExamples\n\n- Two points in the same plane z=t: the 2D result yields a unique color in that plane, which stays unique by Lemma 1.\n- Coordinatewise-injective chain: U={(1,1,1),(2,2,2),(3,3,3)}. Lemma 2 applies (slices are singletons), and the edge between z=2 and z=3 is uniquely colored.\n- General position with mixed signs: U={(1,3,2),(4,1,5),(2,2,7)}. Slices are singletons; Lemma 2 again yields a unique color (between the top two z-levels).\n\nObstacles and checks\n\n- The only potential pitfall is conflating 2D and 3D labels on a slice. This is avoided since equality of c3-labels inside a slice forces equality of the 2D label by the refinement property; thus a 2D-unique edge in the slice is globally unique.\n- The top-two-level argument critically uses that each z-level holds \u22641 point. If some level had \u22652 points, we switch to the slice case and invoke d=2.\n\nNext steps\n\n- Dimension-d induction: define c_d(T,\u2113) analogously. Either a (d\u22121)-dimensional hyperplane slice has \u22652 points (reduce to d\u22121 and lift by the same refinement argument), or every slice along the last coordinate has \u22641 point and the top-two-levels lemma generalizes verbatim to certify a unique c_d-color.\n- Quantitative extension: investigate lower bounds on the number of unique colors as a function of |U| by iterating the top-two-levels argument across disjoint level pairs or via multiplicity factorizations for mixed-sign types.
