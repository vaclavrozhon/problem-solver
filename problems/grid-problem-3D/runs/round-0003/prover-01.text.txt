Ideas

- Use a clean two-case split: either a coordinate slice contains at least two points (reduce to the given d=2 theorem), or every slice along some coordinate has size ≤1 (then an edge between the top two levels in that coordinate has a unique c3-color).
- Record a precise “slice lifting” lemma that formalizes how uniqueness in a 2D slice implies uniqueness in the full 3D graph, because c3 remembers equal coordinates and their values.
- Record a “top-two-levels” lemma for the injective-in-that-coordinate case; its proof isolates c3 by the ℓ-coordinate at that axis.

Lemma 1 (Slice lifting)

Statement. Fix c∈{x,y,z} and t∈[n]. Let U_t=U∩{c=t}. If |U_t|≥2 and there is an edge e within the slice {c=t} whose 2D color (under the d=2 map of the provided theorem) is unique inside G[U_t], then c3(e) appears exactly once in G[U].

Proof. WLOG c=z. For edges within z=t, c3 equals (T,ℓ) with z∈E(T) and ℓ_z=t. If some e′ in G[U] had c3(e′)=c3(e), then z∈E(T(e′)) and ℓ_z(e′)=t, so e′ also lies in the plane z=t. Moreover, equality of 3D labels implies equality of the induced 2D labels on that plane (c3 refines the 2D label: equality of c3 forces equality of type on x,y and of the 2D lower-corner entries). This contradicts the 2D uniqueness of e in G[U_t]. Thus c3(e) is unique in G[U]. ∎

Remark (refinement vs. restriction). On a fixed slice, define the map π that forgets the z-entry and the “z=0” annotation of T from c3. Then π(c3(e)) equals the 2D color of e used in the d=2 theorem. Hence c3-equality implies 2D-color equality.

Lemma 2 (Top two levels give uniqueness when slices are singletons)

Statement. Suppose every z-slice contains at most one point of U. List U by increasing z as v_1,…,v_m with z_1<⋯<z_m (m≥2). Then the edge e=v_{m-1}v_m has a c3-color that appears exactly once in G[U].

Proof. Let e={v_{m-1},v_m}. Any edge e′ with c3(e′)=c3(e) must match ℓ_z(e′)=ℓ_z(e)=z_{m-1}. For an undirected edge, ℓ_z equals the smaller z-coordinate among its endpoints; thus one endpoint of e′ must have z=z_{m-1} and the other must have z>z_{m-1}. By assumption, the only vertex with z=z_{m-1} is v_{m-1}, and the only vertex with z>z_{m-1} is v_m. Hence e′=e. Therefore c3(e) is unique. ∎

Theorem (3D uniqueness of a color under c3)

Statement. For every U⊆[n]^3 with |U|≥2, there exist u_1,u_2∈U such that the edge u_1u_2 has a color that appears exactly once in G[U] under c3.

Proof. If some z-slice U_t has |U_t|≥2, the d=2 theorem on that slice yields an edge with a unique 2D color in G[U_t], and Lemma 1 lifts it to a unique color in G[U]. Otherwise, every z-slice has size ≤1; then Lemma 2 applied to z gives a unique c3-color. ∎

Examples

- Two points in the same plane z=t: the 2D result yields a unique color in that plane, which stays unique by Lemma 1.
- Coordinatewise-injective chain: U={(1,1,1),(2,2,2),(3,3,3)}. Lemma 2 applies (slices are singletons), and the edge between z=2 and z=3 is uniquely colored.
- General position with mixed signs: U={(1,3,2),(4,1,5),(2,2,7)}. Slices are singletons; Lemma 2 again yields a unique color (between the top two z-levels).

Obstacles and checks

- The only potential pitfall is conflating 2D and 3D labels on a slice. This is avoided since equality of c3-labels inside a slice forces equality of the 2D label by the refinement property; thus a 2D-unique edge in the slice is globally unique.
- The top-two-level argument critically uses that each z-level holds ≤1 point. If some level had ≥2 points, we switch to the slice case and invoke d=2.

Next steps

- Dimension-d induction: define c_d(T,ℓ) analogously. Either a (d−1)-dimensional hyperplane slice has ≥2 points (reduce to d−1 and lift by the same refinement argument), or every slice along the last coordinate has ≤1 point and the top-two-levels lemma generalizes verbatim to certify a unique c_d-color.
- Quantitative extension: investigate lower bounds on the number of unique colors as a function of |U| by iterating the top-two-levels argument across disjoint level pairs or via multiplicity factorizations for mixed-sign types.
