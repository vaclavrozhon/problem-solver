  "content": "Ideas\n- Use a two-case split along a coordinate (say z). Either a z-slice contains \u22652 points, and we reduce to the given d=2 theorem and lift uniqueness to 3D; or every z-slice contains \u22641 point, and the edge between the top two z-levels has a uniquely determined \u2113_z, which forces global uniqueness of its color.\n\nLemma 1 (slice lifting to 3D)\nLet t\u2208[n] and U_t={(x,y):(x,y,t)\u2208U}. If an edge e in G[U_t] has a unique color under the 2D coloring from the provided d=2 theorem, then the corresponding 3D edge has a unique color under c_3 in G[U].\nProof. Inside the plane z=t, the 3D type has T_z=0, and c_3 records \u2113_z=t. Any edge e\u2032 not in the plane has T_z\u22600, so c_3(e\u2032)\u2260c_3(e). For edges e\u2032 within z=t, equality c_3(e\u2032)=c_3(e) is equivalent to equality of the 2D types on (x,y) and the same 2D lower corner, hence equality of the 2D colors. Since the 2D color of e is unique on U_t, the 3D color is unique in U.\n\nLemma 2 (top-two z-levels yield uniqueness)\nAssume each z-slice contains \u22641 point of U and |U|\u22652. Let u be the unique point having maximal z in U, and v the unique point having second maximal z. Then c_3(uv) is unique in G[U].\nProof. Let e=uv. Then \u2113_z(e)=z(v). If an edge e\u2032 satisfies c_3(e\u2032)=c_3(e), it must have \u2113_z(e\u2032)=z(v), so one endpoint has z=z(v). Because the z-slice z=z(v) contains exactly one point (v), e\u2032 must be {v,w} with z(w)>z(v). By the choice of v as second maximal, z(w)=z(u); and since the top z-slice also has at most one point, w=u. Thus e\u2032=e.\n\nTheorem (3D uniqueness under c_3)\nFor every U\u2282[n]^3 with |U|\u22652, there exists an edge in G[U] whose color under c_3 appears exactly once in G[U].\nProof. If some z-slice U_t has \u22652 points, apply the d=2 theorem to G[U_t] and lift by Lemma 1. Otherwise each z-slice has \u22641 point, and Lemma 2 yields a uniquely colored edge. (By symmetry, any coordinate can be used.)\n\nExamples\n- Slice case: U\u2229{z=5} contains {(1,1,5),(3,2,5)}. The 2D theorem yields a uniquely colored edge in that slice; c_3 augments it by T_z=0 and \u2113_z=5, so it stays unique globally.\n- Sparse slices: U={(1,1,1),(3,2,2),(2,5,7)}. Each z-slice has \u22641 point. The edge between z=7 and z=2 has \u2113_z=2; by Lemma 2 it is the only edge with that \u2113_z, hence unique.\n\nObstacles / checks\n- The lifting relies crucially on c_3 remembering equality coordinates: T_z=0 and \u2113_z=t pin the slice. This prevents edges off the slice from sharing the color.\n- In the sparse-slice case, only the top z-level lies above the second-top level, so no other partner for v can realize \u2113_z=z(v).\n\nNext steps\n- Dimension-d generalization: define c_d(e)=(T(e),\u2113(u,v)) with T modulo global sign and \u2113 the componentwise minimum. Induct on the last coordinate: if a (d\u22121)-slice has \u22652 points, reduce to d\u22121 and lift (slice-lift lemma generalizes verbatim). Otherwise each last-coordinate slice has \u22641 point; the edge between the top two levels is unique by the same \u2113-last argument. Formalizing this would yield the theorem for all d.\n"
