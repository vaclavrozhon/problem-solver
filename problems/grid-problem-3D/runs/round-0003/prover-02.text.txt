Ideas
- Use a two-case split along a coordinate (say z). Either a z-slice contains ≥2 points, and we reduce to the given d=2 theorem and lift uniqueness to 3D; or every z-slice contains ≤1 point, and the edge between the top two z-levels has a uniquely determined ℓ_z, which forces global uniqueness of its color.

Lemma 1 (slice lifting to 3D)
Let t∈[n] and U_t={(x,y):(x,y,t)∈U}. If an edge e in G[U_t] has a unique color under the 2D coloring from the provided d=2 theorem, then the corresponding 3D edge has a unique color under c_3 in G[U].
Proof. Inside the plane z=t, the 3D type has T_z=0, and c_3 records ℓ_z=t. Any edge e′ not in the plane has T_z≠0, so c_3(e′)≠c_3(e). For edges e′ within z=t, equality c_3(e′)=c_3(e) is equivalent to equality of the 2D types on (x,y) and the same 2D lower corner, hence equality of the 2D colors. Since the 2D color of e is unique on U_t, the 3D color is unique in U.

Lemma 2 (top-two z-levels yield uniqueness)
Assume each z-slice contains ≤1 point of U and |U|≥2. Let u be the unique point having maximal z in U, and v the unique point having second maximal z. Then c_3(uv) is unique in G[U].
Proof. Let e=uv. Then ℓ_z(e)=z(v). If an edge e′ satisfies c_3(e′)=c_3(e), it must have ℓ_z(e′)=z(v), so one endpoint has z=z(v). Because the z-slice z=z(v) contains exactly one point (v), e′ must be {v,w} with z(w)>z(v). By the choice of v as second maximal, z(w)=z(u); and since the top z-slice also has at most one point, w=u. Thus e′=e.

Theorem (3D uniqueness under c_3)
For every U⊂[n]^3 with |U|≥2, there exists an edge in G[U] whose color under c_3 appears exactly once in G[U].
Proof. If some z-slice U_t has ≥2 points, apply the d=2 theorem to G[U_t] and lift by Lemma 1. Otherwise each z-slice has ≤1 point, and Lemma 2 yields a uniquely colored edge. (By symmetry, any coordinate can be used.)

Examples
- Slice case: U∩{z=5} contains {(1,1,5),(3,2,5)}. The 2D theorem yields a uniquely colored edge in that slice; c_3 augments it by T_z=0 and ℓ_z=5, so it stays unique globally.
- Sparse slices: U={(1,1,1),(3,2,2),(2,5,7)}. Each z-slice has ≤1 point. The edge between z=7 and z=2 has ℓ_z=2; by Lemma 2 it is the only edge with that ℓ_z, hence unique.

Obstacles / checks
- The lifting relies crucially on c_3 remembering equality coordinates: T_z=0 and ℓ_z=t pin the slice. This prevents edges off the slice from sharing the color.
- In the sparse-slice case, only the top z-level lies above the second-top level, so no other partner for v can realize ℓ_z=z(v).

Next steps
- Dimension-d generalization: define c_d(e)=(T(e),ℓ(u,v)) with T modulo global sign and ℓ the componentwise minimum. Induct on the last coordinate: if a (d−1)-slice has ≥2 points, reduce to d−1 and lift (slice-lift lemma generalizes verbatim). Otherwise each last-coordinate slice has ≤1 point; the edge between the top two levels is unique by the same ℓ-last argument. Formalizing this would yield the theorem for all d.
