  "content": "# Ideas\n- Prove the d=3 statement by a clean two\u2013case split on a fixed coordinate (say z): either some z\u2013slice has \u22652 points, then reduce to the given d=2 theorem and lift uniqueness; or every z\u2013slice has \u22641 point, then the edge between the two highest realized z\u2013levels has a c_3\u2013color that is forced to be unique.\n- Make the lifting step formal: c_3 remembers both the equal coordinates (E(T)) and their values via \u2113, so an in\u2013slice unique color cannot be reproduced by an edge off that slice.\n- Record a general multiplicity formula A_+\u00b7A_- for 3D colors (optional, but useful for checks and for future generalization to higher d). Here we keep it for reference.\n\n# Slice lifting in 3D (rigorous)\nFix \u03b3\u2208[n], and write the z\u2013slice U_\u03b3:=U\u2229{(x,y,z): z=\u03b3}. Consider the d=2 coloring on (x,y) from the provided theorem.\n\nLemma (slice\u2192global). If |U_\u03b3|\u22652 and G[U_\u03b3] contains an edge e with a color unique in G[U_\u03b3] (under the d=2 map), then the same unordered pair e in G[U] has a color unique under c_3.\n\nProof. Any edge e within U_\u03b3 has z\u2013coordinates equal, so its 3D type T has z\u2208E(T), and \u2113_z(e)=\u03b3 is recorded in c_3(e). Suppose another edge f in G[U] has c_3(f)=c_3(e). Then T(f)=T(e), in particular z\u2208E(T(f)), so the endpoints of f have equal z. Also \u2113_z(f)=\u03b3 forces both endpoints of f to lie on z=\u03b3. Thus f is an edge of G[U_\u03b3] with the same (type on x,y, minima on x,y), contradicting the uniqueness of e in G[U_\u03b3]. Hence c_3(e) is unique in G[U].\n\nMapping types: type 1 in d=2 corresponds to T with J(T)\u2287{x,y} and equal signs on x,y; type 2 corresponds to mixed signs on {x,y}; type 3 (vertical) corresponds to x\u2208E(T); type 4 (horizontal) corresponds to y\u2208E(T). In all cases z\u2208E(T) on the slice.\n\n# The complementary case: at most one point per z\u2013slice\nAssume |U\u2229{z=t}|\u22641 for every t\u2208[n]. Let the realized z\u2013levels be t_1<\u22ef<t_k with k\u22652 (since |U|\u22652). Let u be the unique point with z=t_{k\u22121} and v the unique point with z=t_k.\n\nLemma (top\u2013two levels). The color c_3(uv) is unique in G[U].\n\nProof. Suppose another edge ab has c_3(ab)=c_3(uv). Then \u2113_z(ab)=\u2113_z(uv)=t_{k\u22121}, so one of a,b must have z=t_{k\u22121}. By the slice sparsity, that point must be u. The other endpoint must have z>t_{k\u22121}; as t_k is the only level above t_{k\u22121}, it must be v. Hence ab=uv, so no other edge shares the color.\n\n# Main theorem in 3D\nTheorem. For every U\u2286[n]^3 with |U|\u22652, there is an edge in G[U] whose color under c_3 appears exactly once in G[U].\n\nProof. Fix the z\u2013coordinate.\n- If some slice U_\u03b3 has |U_\u03b3|\u22652, apply the d=2 theorem to G[U_\u03b3] to obtain an in\u2013slice edge with a color unique in that slice; by the slice\u2192global lemma, its c_3\u2013color is unique in G[U].\n- Otherwise, every z\u2013slice has \u22641 point; by the top\u2013two levels lemma, the edge between the unique points at the two highest realized z\u2013levels has a unique c_3\u2013color.\nThus in all cases a unique color exists.\n\n# Optional: 3D multiplicity formula (for checks and extensions)\nFix a representative s\u2208{\u22121,0,+1}^3\\{0} for T. For \u2113=(\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3), define\n- A_+(T,\u2113):= #{ v\u2208U: v_i=\u2113_i for i\u2208E(T); for i\u2208J(T) with s_i=+, v_i>\u2113_i; for i\u2208J(T) with s_i=\u2212, v_i=\u2113_i }.\n- A_\u2212(T,\u2113):= #{ u\u2208U: u_i=\u2113_i for i\u2208E(T); for i\u2208J(T) with s_i=+, u_i=\u2113_i; for i\u2208J(T) with s_i=\u2212, u_i>\u2113_i }.\nMultiplicity lemma. The number of edges with c_3(e)=(T,\u2113) equals A_+(T,\u2113)\u00b7A_\u2212(T,\u2113), independent of the chosen s (flipping s swaps the factors). Proof: biject oriented edges to A_\u2212\u00d7A_+ by orienting differences to match s on J(T) and checking \u2113.\n\n# Examples\n- Slice case: U contains (1,4,5),(3,2,5),(7,9,5). Apply d=2 on z=5 to get an in\u2013slice unique color; it lifts to a unique c_3\u2013color.\n- Sparse z\u2013slices: U={(2,3,4),(5,1,9),(4,8,7)}. Top two z\u2013levels are 7<9; the edge between z=7 and z=9 is the only edge whose lower corner has z=7, thus unique.\n\n# Obstacles and remarks\n- The lifting critically uses that c_3 stores equal coordinates explicitly via E(T) and \u2113; without this memory, an edge off the slice could spoof the color.\n- The sparse\u2013slice argument needs only one coordinate; there is no dependence on x or y injectivity.\n\n# Next steps\n- Generalize to dimension d by induction: either a (d\u22121)\u2013slice has \u22652 points (apply d\u22121 and lift), or each slice is \u22641 point and the top\u2013two levels on the last coordinate yield a unique c_d\u2013color by the same argument. Formalize c_d and the lifting lemma identically.\n- Quantitative direction: bound from below the number of unique colors in terms of |U|; characterize extremal configurations minimizing unique colors."
