# Ideas
- Prove the d=3 statement by a clean two–case split on a fixed coordinate (say z): either some z–slice has ≥2 points, then reduce to the given d=2 theorem and lift uniqueness; or every z–slice has ≤1 point, then the edge between the two highest realized z–levels has a c_3–color that is forced to be unique.
- Make the lifting step formal: c_3 remembers both the equal coordinates (E(T)) and their values via ℓ, so an in–slice unique color cannot be reproduced by an edge off that slice.
- Record a general multiplicity formula A_+·A_- for 3D colors (optional, but useful for checks and for future generalization to higher d). Here we keep it for reference.

# Slice lifting in 3D (rigorous)
Fix γ∈[n], and write the z–slice U_γ:=U∩{(x,y,z): z=γ}. Consider the d=2 coloring on (x,y) from the provided theorem.

Lemma (slice→global). If |U_γ|≥2 and G[U_γ] contains an edge e with a color unique in G[U_γ] (under the d=2 map), then the same unordered pair e in G[U] has a color unique under c_3.

Proof. Any edge e within U_γ has z–coordinates equal, so its 3D type T has z∈E(T), and ℓ_z(e)=γ is recorded in c_3(e). Suppose another edge f in G[U] has c_3(f)=c_3(e). Then T(f)=T(e), in particular z∈E(T(f)), so the endpoints of f have equal z. Also ℓ_z(f)=γ forces both endpoints of f to lie on z=γ. Thus f is an edge of G[U_γ] with the same (type on x,y, minima on x,y), contradicting the uniqueness of e in G[U_γ]. Hence c_3(e) is unique in G[U].

Mapping types: type 1 in d=2 corresponds to T with J(T)⊇{x,y} and equal signs on x,y; type 2 corresponds to mixed signs on {x,y}; type 3 (vertical) corresponds to x∈E(T); type 4 (horizontal) corresponds to y∈E(T). In all cases z∈E(T) on the slice.

# The complementary case: at most one point per z–slice
Assume |U∩{z=t}|≤1 for every t∈[n]. Let the realized z–levels be t_1<⋯<t_k with k≥2 (since |U|≥2). Let u be the unique point with z=t_{k−1} and v the unique point with z=t_k.

Lemma (top–two levels). The color c_3(uv) is unique in G[U].

Proof. Suppose another edge ab has c_3(ab)=c_3(uv). Then ℓ_z(ab)=ℓ_z(uv)=t_{k−1}, so one of a,b must have z=t_{k−1}. By the slice sparsity, that point must be u. The other endpoint must have z>t_{k−1}; as t_k is the only level above t_{k−1}, it must be v. Hence ab=uv, so no other edge shares the color.

# Main theorem in 3D
Theorem. For every U⊆[n]^3 with |U|≥2, there is an edge in G[U] whose color under c_3 appears exactly once in G[U].

Proof. Fix the z–coordinate.
- If some slice U_γ has |U_γ|≥2, apply the d=2 theorem to G[U_γ] to obtain an in–slice edge with a color unique in that slice; by the slice→global lemma, its c_3–color is unique in G[U].
- Otherwise, every z–slice has ≤1 point; by the top–two levels lemma, the edge between the unique points at the two highest realized z–levels has a unique c_3–color.
Thus in all cases a unique color exists.

# Optional: 3D multiplicity formula (for checks and extensions)
Fix a representative s∈{−1,0,+1}^3\{0} for T. For ℓ=(α,β,γ), define
- A_+(T,ℓ):= #{ v∈U: v_i=ℓ_i for i∈E(T); for i∈J(T) with s_i=+, v_i>ℓ_i; for i∈J(T) with s_i=−, v_i=ℓ_i }.
- A_−(T,ℓ):= #{ u∈U: u_i=ℓ_i for i∈E(T); for i∈J(T) with s_i=+, u_i=ℓ_i; for i∈J(T) with s_i=−, u_i>ℓ_i }.
Multiplicity lemma. The number of edges with c_3(e)=(T,ℓ) equals A_+(T,ℓ)·A_−(T,ℓ), independent of the chosen s (flipping s swaps the factors). Proof: biject oriented edges to A_−×A_+ by orienting differences to match s on J(T) and checking ℓ.

# Examples
- Slice case: U contains (1,4,5),(3,2,5),(7,9,5). Apply d=2 on z=5 to get an in–slice unique color; it lifts to a unique c_3–color.
- Sparse z–slices: U={(2,3,4),(5,1,9),(4,8,7)}. Top two z–levels are 7<9; the edge between z=7 and z=9 is the only edge whose lower corner has z=7, thus unique.

# Obstacles and remarks
- The lifting critically uses that c_3 stores equal coordinates explicitly via E(T) and ℓ; without this memory, an edge off the slice could spoof the color.
- The sparse–slice argument needs only one coordinate; there is no dependence on x or y injectivity.

# Next steps
- Generalize to dimension d by induction: either a (d−1)–slice has ≥2 points (apply d−1 and lift), or each slice is ≤1 point and the top–two levels on the last coordinate yield a unique c_d–color by the same argument. Formalize c_d and the lifting lemma identically.
- Quantitative direction: bound from below the number of unique colors in terms of |U|; characterize extremal configurations minimizing unique colors.
