  "content": "# Ideas\n- Strengthen and formalize two simple lemmas that together yield a short, rigorous proof for d=3 using the provided d=2 theorem: (i) slice\u2013lifting and (ii) top\u2013two\u2013levels uniqueness. Both rely critically on the fact that the color c_3 stores E(T) (which coordinates are equal) and the full lower corner \u2113.\n- Provide a dimension\u2013d version (c_d) and prove the general theorem by induction on d. This both consolidates the 3D result and suggests a path forward.\n\n# Lemma 1 (Slice\u2013lifting, d=3)\nLet t\u2208[n] and U_z[t]=U\u2229{(x,y,z): z=t}. If |U_z[t]|\u22652, then there is an edge in G[U] whose c_3\u2013color is unique in G[U].\n\nProof. Restrict to G[U_z[t]] and identify points with their (x,y)\u2013coordinates. Apply the given d=2 theorem to obtain an edge e\u2032 with a unique 2D color in that slice. For any in\u2013slice edge e, its 3D type T has z\u2208E(T), and c_3(e) records \u2113_z=t together with the 2D lower corner on (x,y). Thus two in\u2013slice edges have the same 3D color iff they have the same 2D color. Hence c_3(e\u2032) is unique among in\u2013slice edges. If an edge f outside the slice had c_3(f)=c_3(e\u2032), then its type would also satisfy z\u2208E(T), impossible since f has differing z\u2013coordinates. Therefore c_3(e\u2032) is unique in G[U]. \u220e\n\n# Lemma 2 (Top two z\u2013levels uniqueness)\nAssume |U|\u22652 and every z\u2013slice contains \u22641 point of U. Let z_1<\u22ef<z_m be the realized z\u2013levels of U, with m\u22652, and pick p,q\u2208U s.t. z(p)=z_{m-1}, z(q)=z_m. Then c_3(pq) is unique in G[U].\n\nProof. For any edge f=uv with c_3(f)=c_3(pq), we must have \u2113_z(f)=\u2113_z(pq)=z_{m-1}. Hence one endpoint of f has z=z_{m-1} and the other has z>z_{m-1}. By the at\u2013most\u2013one\u2013per\u2013slice assumption, the unique vertex with z=z_{m-1} is p, and the unique vertex with z>z_{m-1} is q (since z_m is the sole realized level above z_{m-1}, also with \u22641 point). Thus f=pq. Hence c_3(pq) is unique. \u220e\n\n# Theorem (d=3)\nFor every U\u2286[n]^3 with |U|\u22652, there exists an edge in G[U] whose c_3\u2013color appears exactly once in G[U].\n\nProof. If some z\u2013slice has \u22652 points, apply Lemma 1. Otherwise, apply Lemma 2. \u220e\n\n# Dimension\u2013d generalization (for c_d)\nDefinition (c_d). For u\u2260v in [n]^d, define \u03c3(u,v)\u2208{\u22121,0,+1}^d\\{0}^d by componentwise sign. Let T=[\u03c3] modulo global sign (zeros remain zero), and \u2113(u,v) the componentwise minimum in [n]^d. Define c_d(uv)=(T,\u2113(u,v)). As in d=3, E(T)={coordinates with \u03c3_i=0} is well\u2013defined and \u2113 records those fixed coordinates explicitly.\n\nLemma (Slice\u2013lifting, general d). If some last\u2013coordinate slice U_d[t]=U\u2229{x_d=t} has \u22652 points, then an edge with unique c_d\u2013color exists in G[U].\n\nProof. Identify points in the slice with their (d\u22121) coordinates. Apply the d\u22121 theorem to get an in\u2013slice uniquely colored edge. Its 3D analogue lifts: c_d in the slice has last coordinate in E(T) and \u2113_d=t, so uniqueness holds slice\u2013wise and no outside edge can match because it would have last coordinate in J(T). \u220e\n\nLemma (Top two levels, general d). If each last\u2013coordinate slice has \u22641 point, then the edge between the unique vertices at the top two realized levels in the last coordinate has unique c_d\u2013color.\n\nProof. Identical to Lemma 2: the lower\u2013corner\u2019s last coordinate equals the second\u2013highest realized level and forces the endpoints uniquely. \u220e\n\nTheorem (all d\u22652). For every U\u2286[n]^d with |U|\u22652, there exists an edge in G[U] whose c_d\u2013color appears exactly once.\n\nProof. Induct on d. Base d=2 is given. For d\u22653, either a last\u2013coordinate slice has \u22652 points and we use slice\u2013lifting with the inductive hypothesis, or every slice has \u22641 point and we use the top\u2013two\u2013levels lemma. \u220e\n\n# Examples and checks\n- Slice case (d=3): U={ (1,1,2),(3,2,2),(2,1,3) }. In z=2, edges inherit the d=2 coloring; a unique in\u2013slice edge remains unique in G[U].\n- No\u2013slice case: U={ (1,1,1),(2,3,2),(3,2,3) }. Top two z\u2013levels 2<3 give the edge between (2,3,2) and (3,2,3) with \u2113_z=2; no other edge has \u2113_z=2, so unique.\n- Edge case |U|=2: Trivial\u2014there is only one edge and its color is unique.\n\n# Obstacles\n- None for d=3 and the stated c_3: the color label\u2019s inclusion of E(T) and the full \u2113 prevents cross\u2013slice collisions and makes the top\u2013two argument immediate.\n\n# Next steps\n- Curate proofs.md: add the two lemmas for d=3 with their concise proofs; then append the dimension\u2013d induction with the formal c_d definition and the two general lemmas. This yields a compact, fully rigorous resolution of d=3 and beyond.\n- (Optional) Quantitative extension: investigate a lower bound on the number of uniquely colored edges in terms of |U| and d; the present method always guarantees \u22651.\n"
