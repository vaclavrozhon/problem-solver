# Ideas
- Strengthen and formalize two simple lemmas that together yield a short, rigorous proof for d=3 using the provided d=2 theorem: (i) slice–lifting and (ii) top–two–levels uniqueness. Both rely critically on the fact that the color c_3 stores E(T) (which coordinates are equal) and the full lower corner ℓ.
- Provide a dimension–d version (c_d) and prove the general theorem by induction on d. This both consolidates the 3D result and suggests a path forward.

# Lemma 1 (Slice–lifting, d=3)
Let t∈[n] and U_z[t]=U∩{(x,y,z): z=t}. If |U_z[t]|≥2, then there is an edge in G[U] whose c_3–color is unique in G[U].

Proof. Restrict to G[U_z[t]] and identify points with their (x,y)–coordinates. Apply the given d=2 theorem to obtain an edge e′ with a unique 2D color in that slice. For any in–slice edge e, its 3D type T has z∈E(T), and c_3(e) records ℓ_z=t together with the 2D lower corner on (x,y). Thus two in–slice edges have the same 3D color iff they have the same 2D color. Hence c_3(e′) is unique among in–slice edges. If an edge f outside the slice had c_3(f)=c_3(e′), then its type would also satisfy z∈E(T), impossible since f has differing z–coordinates. Therefore c_3(e′) is unique in G[U]. ∎

# Lemma 2 (Top two z–levels uniqueness)
Assume |U|≥2 and every z–slice contains ≤1 point of U. Let z_1<⋯<z_m be the realized z–levels of U, with m≥2, and pick p,q∈U s.t. z(p)=z_{m-1}, z(q)=z_m. Then c_3(pq) is unique in G[U].

Proof. For any edge f=uv with c_3(f)=c_3(pq), we must have ℓ_z(f)=ℓ_z(pq)=z_{m-1}. Hence one endpoint of f has z=z_{m-1} and the other has z>z_{m-1}. By the at–most–one–per–slice assumption, the unique vertex with z=z_{m-1} is p, and the unique vertex with z>z_{m-1} is q (since z_m is the sole realized level above z_{m-1}, also with ≤1 point). Thus f=pq. Hence c_3(pq) is unique. ∎

# Theorem (d=3)
For every U⊆[n]^3 with |U|≥2, there exists an edge in G[U] whose c_3–color appears exactly once in G[U].

Proof. If some z–slice has ≥2 points, apply Lemma 1. Otherwise, apply Lemma 2. ∎

# Dimension–d generalization (for c_d)
Definition (c_d). For u≠v in [n]^d, define σ(u,v)∈{−1,0,+1}^d\{0}^d by componentwise sign. Let T=[σ] modulo global sign (zeros remain zero), and ℓ(u,v) the componentwise minimum in [n]^d. Define c_d(uv)=(T,ℓ(u,v)). As in d=3, E(T)={coordinates with σ_i=0} is well–defined and ℓ records those fixed coordinates explicitly.

Lemma (Slice–lifting, general d). If some last–coordinate slice U_d[t]=U∩{x_d=t} has ≥2 points, then an edge with unique c_d–color exists in G[U].

Proof. Identify points in the slice with their (d−1) coordinates. Apply the d−1 theorem to get an in–slice uniquely colored edge. Its 3D analogue lifts: c_d in the slice has last coordinate in E(T) and ℓ_d=t, so uniqueness holds slice–wise and no outside edge can match because it would have last coordinate in J(T). ∎

Lemma (Top two levels, general d). If each last–coordinate slice has ≤1 point, then the edge between the unique vertices at the top two realized levels in the last coordinate has unique c_d–color.

Proof. Identical to Lemma 2: the lower–corner’s last coordinate equals the second–highest realized level and forces the endpoints uniquely. ∎

Theorem (all d≥2). For every U⊆[n]^d with |U|≥2, there exists an edge in G[U] whose c_d–color appears exactly once.

Proof. Induct on d. Base d=2 is given. For d≥3, either a last–coordinate slice has ≥2 points and we use slice–lifting with the inductive hypothesis, or every slice has ≤1 point and we use the top–two–levels lemma. ∎

# Examples and checks
- Slice case (d=3): U={ (1,1,2),(3,2,2),(2,1,3) }. In z=2, edges inherit the d=2 coloring; a unique in–slice edge remains unique in G[U].
- No–slice case: U={ (1,1,1),(2,3,2),(3,2,3) }. Top two z–levels 2<3 give the edge between (2,3,2) and (3,2,3) with ℓ_z=2; no other edge has ℓ_z=2, so unique.
- Edge case |U|=2: Trivial—there is only one edge and its color is unique.

# Obstacles
- None for d=3 and the stated c_3: the color label’s inclusion of E(T) and the full ℓ prevents cross–slice collisions and makes the top–two argument immediate.

# Next steps
- Curate proofs.md: add the two lemmas for d=3 with their concise proofs; then append the dimension–d induction with the formal c_d definition and the two general lemmas. This yields a compact, fully rigorous resolution of d=3 and beyond.
- (Optional) Quantitative extension: investigate a lower bound on the number of uniquely colored edges in terms of |U| and d; the present method always guarantees ≥1.
