  "summary_md": "Built a short, complete proof for d=3 using the provided d=2 file. Key idea: split on a coordinate (wlog z). If some z\u2013slice U\u2229{z=t} has \u22652 points, apply the d=2 theorem there and lift uniqueness to 3D because c_3 records the equal coordinate (z\u2208E(T) and \u2113_z=t). Otherwise every z\u2013slice has \u22641 point; ordering by z, the edge between the two highest z-levels has a uniquely determined \u2113_z and hence a unique c_3\u2013color. An alternative viewpoint factors multiplicities as A_+(T,\u2113)\u00b7A_\u2212(T,\u2113), which handles mixed-sign/injective cases and suggests an induction to general d. (Relied on the supplied 2D LaTeX proof.)",
  "highlights": [
    "Proved d=3 theorem: every U\u2286[n]^3 with |U|\u22652 contains an edge whose c_3\u2013color appears exactly once.",
    "Two-case reduction: (i) slice case \u2014 use d=2 on a coordinate hyperplane and lift uniqueness since c_3 records equal coordinates; (ii) injective/top-two case \u2014 each slice \u22641 point, so top-two-level edge has unique \u2113 in that coordinate.",
    "Multiplicity factorization: for fixed (T,\u2113) edge count equals A_+(T,\u2113)\u00b7A_\u2212(T,\u2113); under slice-injectivity this forces realized mixed-sign edges to be unique.",
    "Argument gives a clear inductive template to extend to arbitrary dimension d by reducing on a (d\u22121)-slice or using the top-two-level argument."
