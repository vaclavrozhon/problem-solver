Built a short, complete proof for d=3 using the provided d=2 file. Key idea: split on a coordinate (wlog z). If some z–slice U∩{z=t} has ≥2 points, apply the d=2 theorem there and lift uniqueness to 3D because c_3 records the equal coordinate (z∈E(T) and ℓ_z=t). Otherwise every z–slice has ≤1 point; ordering by z, the edge between the two highest z-levels has a uniquely determined ℓ_z and hence a unique c_3–color. An alternative viewpoint factors multiplicities as A_+(T,ℓ)·A_−(T,ℓ), which handles mixed-sign/injective cases and suggests an induction to general d. (Relied on the supplied 2D LaTeX proof.)
