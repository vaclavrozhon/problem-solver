{"summary_md":"Built a short, complete proof for d=3 using the provided d=2 file. Key idea: split on a coordinate (wlog z). If some z–slice U∩{z=t} has ≥2 points, apply the d=2 theorem there and lift uniqueness to 3D because c_3 records the equal coordinate (z∈E(T) and ℓ_z=t). Otherwise every z–slice has ≤1 point; ordering by z, the edge between the two highest z-levels has a uniquely determined ℓ_z and hence a unique c_3–color. An alternative viewpoint factors multiplicities as A_+(T,ℓ)·A_−(T,ℓ), which handles mixed-sign/injective cases and suggests an induction to general d. (Relied on the supplied 2D LaTeX proof.)","highlights":["Proved d=3 theorem: every U⊆[n]^3 with |U|≥2 contains an edge whose c_3–color appears exactly once.","Two-case reduction: (i) slice case — use d=2 on a coordinate hyperplane and lift uniqueness since c_3 records equal coordinates; (ii) injective/top-two case — each slice ≤1 point, so top-two-level edge has unique ℓ in that coordinate.","Multiplicity factorization: for fixed (T,ℓ) edge count equals A_+(T,ℓ)·A_−(T,ℓ); under slice-injectivity this forces realized mixed-sign edges to be unique.","Argument gives a clear inductive template to extend to arbitrary dimension d by reducing on a (d−1)-slice or using the top-two-level argument."],"next_questions":["Write a formal LaTeX induction proving the statement for general d (clean writeup and base case reference to the d=2 file).","Double-check corner cases where types have multiple zero coordinates to ensure no unintended color collisions (verify multiplicity bookkeeping)."]}
