We initially focused on the uniqueness of \u2113_z, but I wonder if we also need the type T to match. It seems that to ensure uniqueness, no other edge should share the same color and type (T, \u2113). We need to consider whether different edges could have the same \u2113_z but produce the same overall \u2113 while varying in x and y components. However, if the only other edge must be {v_{m-1}, v_m}, that could solve the issue even if \u2113_x and \u2113_y differ. Did we come to that conclusion?",

I\u2019m considering if there could be issues with orientation's sign, but it looks like in-slice edges maintain z=0, and sign for x and y follows a global mod. The 2D theorem also utilizes this.

The essential points are: (i) slice-lifting from the provided d=2 theorem using that c_3 records equal coordinates (E(T)) and the exact level in \u2113, and (ii) if every z-slice contains at most one point, the edge between the top two z-levels has a uniquely determined \u2113_z, forcing uniqueness of its c_3-color.\\n\\nProver 1: Your layer-reduction lemma is correct. The alternative \u201cgeneral position\u201d argument (max x among predecessors of the top z-vertex) is valid but unnecessary for d=3; the top-two z-levels lemma suffices under the weaker hypothesis that each z-slice has \u22641 point. Your exclusion of duplicates via \u2113 comparisons is rigorous.\\n\\nProver 2: The slice-lift is sound. Your product formula for a one-odd-coordinate type is correct conceptually, but it needs an explicit choice of orientation representative of T (modulo global sign) to pin down which endpoint contributes which minima; with that clarified, r\u00b7s=1 under coordinate-plane injectivity holds. The approach is heavier than needed in d=3 but provides useful tools.\\n\\nProver 3: The A_+\u00b7A_- multiplicity framework is accurate and orientation-invariant; it gives a robust basis for higher-d generalization. For the current goal, the simpler slice + top-two proof suffices, but your lemma is a good resource for future extensions.\\n\\nProver 4: A succinct and rigorous presentation of the slice-lifting and top-two z-levels lemmas; this is the most streamlined proof.\\n\\nNext steps: (1) Write the general d-dimensional induction: either a (d\u22121)-slice has \u22652 points (apply the d\u22121 theorem and lift), or every last-coordinate slice has \u22641 point and the top-two-levels edge is unique by the last-coordinate entry of \u2113.

Let G be the complete graph on V=[n]^3. For u\\\\neq v, define the sign vector \\\\sigma(u,v)\\\\in\\\\{-1,0,+1\\\\}^3\\\\setminus\\\\{(0,0,0)\\\\} componentwise, the type T(e)=[\\\\sigma(u,v)] modulo global sign, and the componentwise minimum \\\\ell(u,v). The color is c_3(uv)=(T(e),\\\\ell(u,v)).\\n\\nWe will use the proven 2D theorem on slices: in [n]^2 with the 2D coloring that records the type (modulo global sign) and the appropriate minima (including which coordinates are equal), every induced subgraph on a nonempty vertex set of size at least 2 contains an edge whose color appears exactly once.\\n\\nLemma (slice lifting). Fix t\\\\in[n]. Let U_t=U\\\\cap\\\\{(x,y,z): z=t\\\\}. If |U_t|\\\\ge 2 and an edge e within G[U_t] has a unique 2D color (under the 2D map), then e has a unique color in G[U] under c_3.\\n\\nProof. Any edge within z=t has T_z=0 and c_3 records \\\\ell_z=t. If another edge f in G[U] satisfied c_3(f)=c_3(e), then T_z(f)=0 and \\\\ell_z(f)=t, so both endpoints of f lie in z=t. On that slice, equality of 3D labels implies equality of the 2D labels. Since e is unique in G[U_t] under the 2D coloring, no such f\\\\ne e exists. Hence c_3(e) is unique in G[U].\\\\quad\\\\square\\n\\nLemma (top two z-levels). Suppose each z-slice U\\\\cap\\\\{z=t\\\\} contains at most one point and |U|\\\\ge 2. Let the realized z-levels be z_1<\\\\cdots<z_m (m\\\\ge 2). Let p,q\\\\in U satisfy z(p)=z_{m-1} and z(q)=z_m. Then c_3(pq) is unique in G[U].\\n\\nProof. Let e=pq. If an edge f=uv had c_3(f)=c_3(e), then in particular \\\\ell_z(f)=\\\\ell_z(e)=z_{m-1}. Thus one endpoint of f has z=z_{m-1} and the other has z>z_{m-1}. By the at-most-one-per-slice assumption, the unique vertex with z=z_{m-1} is p, and the unique vertex with z>z_{m-1} is q (since z_m is the only realized level above z_{m-1}, with at most one point). Hence f=e. Therefore c_3(e) is unique.\\\\quad\\\\square\\n\\nTheorem (d=3). For every U\\\\subseteq[n]^3 with |U|\\\\ge 2, the induced subgraph G[U] contains an edge whose color under c_3 appears exactly once in G[U].\\n\\nProof. If some z-slice U_t has size at least 2, apply the 2D theorem on G[U_t] and lift the resulting edge by the slice-lifting lemma. Otherwise, every z-slice has size at most 1; by the top-two z-levels lemma, the edge between the unique vertices at the two highest realized z-levels has a unique color under c_3.\\\\quad\\\\square\\n\\nRemark (toward higher dimensions). The same dichotomy yields an induction for dimension d: either a (d\u22121)-dimensional slice along the last coordinate contains at least two points (apply the (d\u22121) theorem and lift), or each last-coordinate slice has at most one point and the edge between the top two levels has a unique last-coordinate entry in \\\\ell, ensuring uniqueness of c_d.\\\\n\"},\"output_update\":null}",
