Adopt the clean two-case proof for d=3: if a z-slice has ≥2 points, apply the d=2 theorem and lift uniqueness since c_3 stores equal coordinates and ℓ_z; else each z-slice has ≤1 point and the edge between the top two z-levels has unique ℓ_z, hence a unique color. We append a concise formal proof (slice-lifting lemma, top-two lemma, 3D theorem) to proofs.md. Path to general d via the same split is clear.
