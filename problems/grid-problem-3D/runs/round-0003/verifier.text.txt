{"feedback_md":"All provers converged on a correct two-case strategy that cleanly solves the d=3 problem with the given coloring c_3. The essential points are: (i) slice-lifting from the provided d=2 theorem using that c_3 records equal coordinates (E(T)) and the exact level in ℓ, and (ii) if every z-slice contains at most one point, the edge between the top two z-levels has a uniquely determined ℓ_z, forcing uniqueness of its c_3-color.\n\nProver 1: Your layer-reduction lemma is correct. The alternative “general position” argument (max x among predecessors of the top z-vertex) is valid but unnecessary for d=3; the top-two z-levels lemma suffices under the weaker hypothesis that each z-slice has ≤1 point. Your exclusion of duplicates via ℓ comparisons is rigorous.\n\nProver 2: The slice-lift is sound. Your product formula for a one-odd-coordinate type is correct conceptually, but it needs an explicit choice of orientation representative of T (modulo global sign) to pin down which endpoint contributes which minima; with that clarified, r·s=1 under coordinate-plane injectivity holds. The approach is heavier than needed in d=3 but provides useful tools.\n\nProver 3: The A_+·A_- multiplicity framework is accurate and orientation-invariant; it gives a robust basis for higher-d generalization. For the current goal, the simpler slice + top-two proof suffices, but your lemma is a good resource for future extensions.\n\nProver 4: A succinct and rigorous presentation of the slice-lifting and top-two z-levels lemmas; this is the most streamlined proof.\n\nNext steps: (1) Write the general d-dimensional induction: either a (d−1)-slice has ≥2 points (apply the d−1 theorem and lift), or every last-coordinate slice has ≤1 point and the top-two-levels edge is unique by the last-coordinate entry of ℓ. (2) Formalize the A_+·A_- multiplicity for general d. (3) Investigate quantitative bounds on the number of unique colors in terms of |U| and d.","summary_md":"Adopt the clean two-case proof for d=3: if a z-slice has ≥2 points, apply the d=2 theorem and lift uniqueness since c_3 stores equal coordinates and ℓ_z; else each z-slice has ≤1 point and the edge between the top two z-levels has unique ℓ_z, hence a unique color.

Let G be the complete graph on V=[n]^3. For u\\neq v, define the sign vector \\sigma(u,v)\\in\\{-1,0,+1\\}^3\\setminus\\{(0,0,0)\\} componentwise, the type T(e)=[\\sigma(u,v)] modulo global sign, and the componentwise minimum \\ell(u,v). The color is c_3(uv)=(T(e),\\ell(u,v)).\n\nWe will use the proven 2D theorem on slices: in [n]^2 with the 2D coloring that records the type (modulo global sign) and the appropriate minima (including which coordinates are equal), every induced subgraph on a nonempty vertex set of size at least 2 contains an edge whose color appears exactly once.\n\nLemma (slice lifting). Fix t\\in[n]. Let U_t=U\\cap\\{(x,y,z): z=t\\}. If |U_t|\\ge 2 and an edge e within G[U_t] has a unique 2D color (under the 2D map), then e has a unique color in G[U] under c_3.\n\nProof. Any edge within z=t has T_z=0 and c_3 records \\ell_z=t. If another edge f in G[U] satisfied c_3(f)=c_3(e), then T_z(f)=0 and \\ell_z(f)=t, so both endpoints of f lie in z=t. On that slice, equality of 3D labels implies equality of the 2D labels. Since e is unique in G[U_t] under the 2D coloring, no such f\\ne e exists. Hence c_3(e) is unique in G[U].\\quad\\square\n\nLemma (top two z-levels). Suppose each z-slice U\\cap\\{z=t\\} contains at most one point and |U|\\ge 2. Let the realized z-levels be z_1<\\cdots<z_m (m\\ge 2). Let p,q\\in U satisfy z(p)=z_{m-1} and z(q)=z_m. Then c_3(pq) is unique in G[U].\n\nProof. Let e=pq. If an edge f=uv had c_3(f)=c_3(e), then in particular \\ell_z(f)=\\ell_z(e)=z_{m-1}. Thus one endpoint of f has z=z_{m-1} and the other has z>z_{m-1}. By the at-most-one-per-slice assumption, the unique vertex with z=z_{m-1} is p, and the unique vertex with z>z_{m-1} is q (since z_m is the only realized level above z_{m-1}, with at most one point). Hence f=e. Therefore c_3(e) is unique.\\quad\\square\n\nTheorem (d=3). For every U\\subseteq[n]^3 with |U|\\ge 2, the induced subgraph G[U] contains an edge whose color under c_3 appears exactly once in G[U].\n\nProof. If some z-slice U_t has size at least 2, apply the 2D theorem on G[U_t] and lift the resulting edge by the slice-lifting lemma. Otherwise, every z-slice has size at most 1; by the top-two z-levels lemma, the edge between the unique vertices at the two highest realized z-levels has a unique color under c_3.\\quad\\square\n\nRemark (toward higher dimensions). The same dichotomy yields an induction for dimension d: either a (d−1)-dimensional slice along the last coordinate contains at least two points (apply the (d−1) theorem and lift), or each last-coordinate slice has at most one point and the edge between the top two levels has a unique last-coordinate entry in \\ell, ensuring uniqueness of c_d.\\n"},"output_update":null}
