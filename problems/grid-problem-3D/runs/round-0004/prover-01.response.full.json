It's interesting how the top-two-layers argument only requires up to one point along each coordinate, not injectivity. I'm proposing an \"Alternative uniqueness via multiplicity factorization\" lemma for 3D injections, focusing on minimalism. I'm also considering a \"Quantitative bound\" for unique colors, wondering if we can always find at least one. It seems possible that if every z-slice has \u22641 point and m\u22652, we might end up with exactly one unique color, or even more.",

I'm curious whether having a pair share x or y across different z affects recognition, but it seems not relevant since the uniqueness argument focuses on \u2113_z. I also want to note that the property is coordinate-symmetric, where I can always choose a coordinate with slices of size \u22652 or \u22641.

It\u2019s good because we can just choose one coordinate without loss of generality (wlog). For the second case, we can only proceed if that coordinate has every slice size \u22641.

The proof discusses coloring c(e) based on type and minimum values for vertical/horizontal types.

Both are elementary and auditable.\\n- These ingredients also extend verbatim to all dimensions d by a short induction: reduce on a (d\u22121)-slice if available; otherwise, use the last-coordinate top-two-levels uniqueness.\\n\\nLemma 1 (Slice lifting from d=2)\\n\\nStatement. Fix c\u2208{x,y,z} and t\u2208[n]. Let U_t:=U\u2229{c=t}. If |U_t|\u22652 and G[U_t] contains an edge e whose (2D) color under the d=2 map is unique in G[U_t], then c_3(e) appears exactly once in G[U].\\n\\nProof. WLOG c=z. For any in-slice edge e with z=t, c_3(e)=(T,\u2113) has z\u2208E(T) and \u2113_z=t. If an edge e\u2032 in G[U] had c_3(e\u2032)=c_3(e), then necessarily z\u2208E(T(e\u2032)) and \u2113_z(e\u2032)=t, so both endpoints of e\u2032 lie in the plane z=t. Equality of c_3-labels on that plane implies equality of the induced 2D color on (x,y) (c_3 refines the 2D label by including the same type on x,y and the same lower-corner entries). This contradicts the uniqueness of e in G[U_t]. Hence c_3(e) is unique in G[U]. \u220e\\n\\nLemma 2 (Top two levels when slices are singletons)\\n\\nStatement. Suppose every z-slice U\u2229{z=t} contains at most one point of U. Let U={v_1,\u2026,v_m} ordered by increasing z: z_1<\u22ef<z_m, m\u22652. Then the edge e=v_{m-1}v_m has a c_3-color that appears exactly once in G[U].\\n\\nProof. For any edge f, \u2113_z(f) is the smaller z-coordinate of its endpoints. If c_3(f)=c_3(e), then \u2113_z(f)=z_{m-1}. Thus one endpoint of f must have z=z_{m-1} and the other must have z>z_{m-1}. Since z_{m-1} is the second-largest realized z-value and each z-slice has \u22641 point, the only such pair is {v_{m-1},v_m}. Hence f=e, proving uniqueness of c_3(e). \u220e\\n\\nTheorem (3D uniqueness under c_3)\\n\\nStatement. For every U\u2286[n]^3 with |U|\u22652, there exists an edge of G[U] whose c_3-color appears exactly once in G[U].\\n\\nProof. If some z-slice U_t has |U_t|\u22652, apply the given d=2 theorem on U_t and lift by Lemma 1. Otherwise every z-slice has size \u22641, so Lemma 2 yields a unique color. \u220e\\n\\nExamples / sanity checks\\n\\n- U={(1,1,5),(2,3,5),(4,2,7)}: the slice z=5 has \u22652 points, so the 2D theorem gives an in-slice unique color; Lemma 1 lifts it.\\n- U={(1,1,1),(3,2,4),(2,3,8)}: each z-level occurs once; the edge between z=4 and z=8 has unique color by Lemma 2.\\n- U={(1,1,1),(2,2,2),(3,3,3)}: chain; Lemma 2 again applies.\\n\\nObstacles and checks\\n\\n- Potential confusion between 2D and 3D colors on a slice is ruled out: equality of c_3-labels in a fixed slice implies equality of the 2D label because c_3 records z\u2208E(T) and \u2113_z=t and matches type and lower-corner entries on x,y.\\n- In the singleton-slice case, uniqueness of \u2113_z at z_{m-1} forces the endpoints; no additional type matching is needed once the pair is uniquely determined.\\n\\nExtension: dimension d\u22652 (concise induction)\\n\\nDefinitions. For u\u2260v in [n]^d, let \u03c3(u,v)\u2208{\u22121,0,+1}^d\\\\{0} be the sign vector, T=[\u03c3] modulo global sign, and \u2113(u,v)=componentwise min. Define c_d(uv)=(T,\u2113).\\n\\nTheorem (d-dimensional uniqueness). For every U\u2286[n]^d with |U|\u22652, some edge of G[U] has a c_d-color appearing exactly once in G[U].\\n\\nProof sketch. Induct on d. Base d=2 given. For the step d\u2192d+1, fix the last coordinate. If some slice {x_{d+1}=t} contains \u22652 points, apply the d-theorem on that slice and lift as in Lemma 1 (c_{d+1} records equality in the (d+1)-st coordinate and \u2113_{d+1}=t). Otherwise, every last-coordinate slice has size \u22641. Order points by that coordinate; the edge between the top two levels has \u2113_{d+1} equal to the second-largest realized value, which forces the endpoints uniquely, hence its c_{d+1}-color is unique (generalizing Lemma 2). \u220e\\n\\nNext steps\\n\\n- If desired, formalize the d-dimensional slice-lifting lemma and the top-two-level lemma with full details, to be added to proofs.md.\\n- Quantitative question: lower bounds on the number of unique colors as a function of |U|; start with chains (many unique [+,\u2026, +]-colors) and sparse-slice configurations. \"}",
