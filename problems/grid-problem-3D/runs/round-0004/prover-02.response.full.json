Provide a concrete counterexample and replace that step with a correct dichotomy: either (i) some coordinate slice has \u22652 points (reduce to d=2 and lift), or (ii) every coordinate slice in each of x,y,z has \u22641 point (coordinatewise injective), in which case a mixed-sign edge has unique color by a product count; if no mixed-sign edges exist, U is a chain and a [+++] color is unique.\\n- State and prove the needed multiplicity fact for a one-minus type ([++\u2212]) in 3D with a fixed orientation representative, ensuring no ambiguity modulo global sign.\\n\\nCounterexample to the \u201ctop-two z-level\u201d uniqueness claim\\nLet v=(1,1,2), u=(2,2,5), w=(3,3,3). Each z-slice has \u22641 point. The edges vu and vw both have\\nT=[+++], \u2113(v,u)=\u2113(v,w)=(1,1,2), so c_3(vu)=c_3(vw), contradicting uniqueness for the top-two z-level edge. Thus the argument relying only on \u2113_z is invalid.\\n\\nLemma 1 (slice lifting to 3D; unchanged and correct)\\nLet t\u2208[n] and U_t={(x,y):(x,y,t)\u2208U}. If an edge e in G[U_t] has a unique color under the 2D coloring from the provided d=2 theorem, then the corresponding 3D edge has a unique color under c_3 in G[U].\\nProof. Any edge not in z=t has T_z\u22600, hence a different 3D color. Inside z=t, equality of 3D colors forces equality of the projected 2D color. Uniqueness in U_t implies uniqueness in U.\\n\\nFact A (type [+++] multiplicity)\\nFor \u2113=(\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3)\u2208[n]^3,\\n# { e\u2208E(G[U]) : c_3(e)=([+++],\u2113) } = 1_{\u2113\u2208U} \u00b7 |NE_3(\u2113)|,\\nwhere NE_3(\u2113)={ q\u2208U : q_x>\u03b1, q_y>\u03b2, q_z>\u03b3 }.\\nReason: \u2113 must be one endpoint; any q\u2208NE_3(\u2113) yields the other endpoint; conversely, any [+++] edge with lower corner \u2113 arises this way.\\n\\nFact B (type [++\u2212] multiplicity with fixed orientation)\\nFix the representative sign vector (+,+,\u2212). For \u2113=(\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3), define\\nr_z(\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3)= |{ v\u2208U : v_x=\u03b1, v_y=\u03b2, v_z>\u03b3 }|,\\ns_{xy}(\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3)= |{ u\u2208U : u_z=\u03b3, u_x>\u03b1, u_y>\u03b2 }|.\\nThen\\n# { e\u2208E(G[U]) : c_3(e)=([++\u2212],\u2113) } = r_z(\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3)\u00b7s_{xy}(\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3).\\nProof. Orient each such edge as (v,u) so that \u03c3(v,u)=(+,+,\u2212). Then min-coordinates are (v_x,v_y,u_z)=(\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3), with constraints v_x=\u03b1, v_y=\u03b2, v_z>\u03b3 and u_z=\u03b3, u_x>\u03b1, u_y>\u03b2. This gives a bijection between edges and pairs (v,u) counted by r_z and s_{xy}.\\n\\nLemma 2 (coordinatewise injective case \u21d2 a unique color)\\nAssume every coordinate plane contains \u22641 point of U (i.e., x, y, z are injective on U) and |U|\u22652. Then G[U] contains a uniquely colored edge under c_3.\\nProof. If there exists an edge with exactly one minus (equivalently two plus) in its oriented sign pattern, by Fact B we have r_z\u22641 and s_{xy}\u22641 (injectivity on z-plane and on the (x,y)-row), and since the color occurs at least once we get r_z=s_{xy}=1, hence multiplicity 1. By symmetry, the same holds for \u201cexactly one plus\u201d. If no edge has exactly one minus or one plus, then every pair has either all pluses or all minuses; thus U is totally ordered by the product order. Let w be the second-largest element. Then NE_3(w)={maximal element}, so by Fact A the [+++] color with lower corner w has multiplicity 1.\\n\\nTheorem (3D uniqueness under c_3; corrected proof)\\nFor every U\u2282[n]^3 with |U|\u22652, there exists an edge with a color that appears exactly once under c_3.\\nProof. If some coordinate slice (z=t, or y=t, or x=t) contains \u22652 points, apply the 2D theorem to that (d=2) slice and lift by Lemma 1. Otherwise, every coordinate slice in x,y,z contains \u22641 point, hence by Lemma 2 there is a uniquely colored edge.\\n\\nExamples (sanity checks)\\n- Slice case: U\u2229{z=5}={(1,1,5),(3,2,5),(4,4,5)}. 2D theorem yields a unique in-slice color; it lifts.\\n- Injective case, mixed-sign: U={(1,1,3),(2,2,2),(3,3,1)}. The edge (3,3,1)\u2013(1,1,3) has type [++\u2212] and, by Fact B with injectivity, multiplicity 1.\\n- Injective case, chain: U={(1,1,1),(2,2,2),(3,3,3)}. The edge between (2,2,2) and (3,3,3) has color ([+++],(2,2,2)) and multiplicity 1.\\n\\nObstacles\\n- The previously used \u201ctop-two z-levels\u201d lemma under only the hypothesis \u201ceach z-slice has \u22641 point\u201d fails; uniqueness of \u2113_z alone does not pin down the partner. The corrected dichotomy avoids this pitfall by requiring injectivity in all coordinates for the non-slice case.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Generalize to dimension d: define c_d(e)=(T(e),\u2113). Either some (d\u22121)-dimensional slice has \u22652 points (reduce to d\u22121 and lift), or every coordinate hyperplane contains \u22641 point (coordinatewise injective). In the latter case for d=3 we are done; for general d one can target types with exactly one minus (or one plus) and extend Fact B appropriately; if no mixed-sign edges exist, U is a chain and a [+,\u2026, +] color with lower corner at the penultimate element is unique by the d-dimensional analogue of Fact A. Formalizing the d-dimensional product count is a natural next step.\\n\"}",
