  "content": "# Ideas\n- Generalize the 3D result to all dimensions d via a clean slice\u2013injective dichotomy and an induction on d. The key tool is a slice lifting lemma that relies on the fact that the color c_d records equal coordinates and their values in the lower corner \u2113.\n- Record a general multiplicity formula for any dimension d and any type T: the number of edges of a given color (T,\u2113) equals A_+(T,\u2113)\u00b7A_\u2212(T,\u2113). This subsumes the d=2 Facts and the 3D multiplicities and is useful to certify uniqueness in special configurations.\n\n# Setup in general dimension d\nLet d\u22652 and V=[n]^d. For u\u2260v\u2208V, let \u03c3(u,v)\u2208{\u22121,0,+1}^d\\{0} be the sign vector of coordinatewise differences. The type is T=[\u03c3] modulo global sign. Write J(T)=\\{i\u2208[d]: \u03c3_i\u22600\\}, E(T)=[d]\\J(T). Define the componentwise minimum \u2113(u,v)\u2208[n]^d. The color is c_d(uv)=(T(e),\u2113(u,v)). This records both the pattern of equal coordinates (E(T)) and their values (the corresponding entries of \u2113).\n\n# Multiplicity formula in general d\nFix a type T and choose a representative s\u2208{\u22121,0,+1}^d\\{0} with J(T)=\\{i: s_i\u22600\\}, E(T)=\\{i: s_i=0\\}. For \u2113\u2208[n]^d define\n- A_+(T,\u2113)= #\\{ v\u2208U: v_i=\u2113_i for i\u2208E(T); if s_i=+ then v_i>\u2113_i; if s_i=\u2212 then v_i=\u2113_i \\}.\n- A_\u2212(T,\u2113)= #\\{ u\u2208U: u_i=\u2113_i for i\u2208E(T); if s_i=+ then u_i=\u2113_i; if s_i=\u2212 then u_i>\u2113_i \\}.\n\nLemma (Multiplicity in d). The number of edges e in G[U] with c_d(e)=(T,\u2113) equals A_+(T,\u2113)\u00b7A_\u2212(T,\u2113), independent of the chosen representative s.\n\nProof. Orient an unordered edge {u,v} to (u\u2192v) so that for every i\u2208J(T), the sign of v_i\u2212u_i equals s_i; for i\u2208E(T) we have u_i=v_i=\u2113_i. Then u and v satisfy the defining constraints of A_\u2212 and A_+, respectively, and \u2113(u,v)=\u2113. Conversely any (u,v) in A_\u2212\u00d7A_+ yields an oriented edge with type T and lower corner \u2113. This gives a bijection between oriented edges of color (T,\u2113) and A_\u2212\u00d7A_+. Each unordered edge has exactly one such orientation (flipping s swaps A_+ and A_\u2212), so the total is A_+\u00b7A_\u2212.\n\nWhy useful here: It certifies uniqueness whenever one of the factors is 1 and the other is 1 (and cannot exceed 1), and it reduces many checks to simple counting in slices/lines.\n\n# Slice lifting in general d\nFix a coordinate index r\u2208[d] and \u03bb\u2208[n]. Define the r\u2013slice U_{r=\u03bb}:=\\{p\u2208U: p_r=\u03bb\\}. On that slice, consider the (d\u22121)\u2013dimensional version of the problem on the remaining coordinates.\n\nLemma (slice\u2192global). If |U_{r=\u03bb}|\u22652 and there is an edge e within G[U_{r=\u03bb}] whose color is unique under c_{d\u22121} on the (d\u22121) remaining coordinates, then the same unordered pair e has a unique color under c_d in G[U].\n\nProof. Any edge inside U_{r=\u03bb} has r\u2208E(T) and \u2113_r=\u03bb. If another edge f in G[U] had c_d(f)=c_d(e), then T(f)=T(e) (hence r\u2208E(T)) and \u2113_r(f)=\u03bb. Thus the endpoints of f lie on the r\u2013slice \u03bb and the restriction of c_d to the remaining coordinates equals the c_{d\u22121} color of e. By uniqueness in the slice, f=e. Hence c_d(e) is unique in G[U].\n\nWhy useful here: It lets us invoke the (already proven) d=2 theorem on coordinate planes to obtain a globally unique color in d=3; for general d it is the inductive step.\n\n# Main theorem in dimension d (induction)\nTheorem. For every d\u22652 and every U\u2286[n]^d with |U|\u22652, there exists an edge in G[U] whose color under c_d appears exactly once in G[U].\n\nProof by induction on d. Base case d=2 is given by the supplied theorem.\nInductive step d\u22121\u2192d. Fix a coordinate r (wlog r=d). If some slice U_{d=\u03bb} has |U_{d=\u03bb}|\u22652, apply the induction hypothesis (dimension d\u22121) to G[U_{d=\u03bb}] to obtain an in\u2013slice edge with unique color under c_{d\u22121}; by slice\u2192global, it is also unique under c_d in G[U]. Otherwise, every slice U_{d=\u03bb} has size \u22641. Let the realized d\u2013th coordinates be \u03bb_1<\u22ef<\u03bb_k with k\u22652 (since |U|\u22652). Let u be the unique point at \u03bb_{k\u22121} and v the unique point at \u03bb_k. Consider e=uv. Its lower corner satisfies \u2113_d(e)=\u03bb_{k\u22121}. If another edge f=ab had c_d(f)=c_d(e), then \u2113_d(f)=\u03bb_{k\u22121}, so one endpoint has d\u2013th coordinate \u03bb_{k\u22121}, i.e., must be u. The other must have d\u2013th coordinate >\u03bb_{k\u22121}; as the only realized value above is \u03bb_k, it must be v. Hence f=e, so c_d(e) is unique. This closes the induction.\n\nWhy useful here: It immediately yields the desired 3D result as the case d=3.\n\n# Specialization: dimension 3 (concise proof)\n- If some z\u2013slice U_{z=\u03b3} has \u22652 points, apply the given d=2 theorem on that slice; by slice\u2192global, the obtained in\u2013slice unique color lifts to a unique c_3 color in G[U].\n- Otherwise every z\u2013slice has \u22641 point; order the realized z\u2013values \u03b3_1<\u22ef<\u03b3_k with k\u22652. Let u at \u03b3_{k\u22121} and v at \u03b3_k. The edge uv has \u2113_z=\u03b3_{k\u22121} and is the only edge with this \u2113_z (by the same argument), hence c_3(uv) is unique.\n\n# Examples\n- Slice case (d=3): U\u2229{z=5} contains (1,4,5),(3,2,5),(7,6,5). The d=2 theorem on (x,y) in that plane yields an in\u2013slice unique color; the 3D color includes E(T)\u2287{z} and \u2113_z=5, so it is globally unique.\n- Injective-slices case (d=3): U has one point per z\u2013value, say z\u2208{2,7,9}, with unique points u at z=7, v at z=9. Then uv is the unique edge with \u2113_z=7, hence unique color.\n- Higher d (d=4): If no coordinate slice along the 4th coordinate has \u22652 points, the edge between the points at the top two realized 4th coordinates is unique for the same reason (forced \u2113_4).\n\n# Obstacles\n- Quantitative bounds beyond existence (e.g., a lower bound on the number of unique colors as a function of |U|) are nontrivial: in dense slices, many colors may repeat; in injective configurations many realized (T,\u2113) may be unique via the multiplicity lemma. Identifying extremal U minimizing the number of unique colors likely requires additional structure (e.g., approximate product sets or layered patterns).\n\n# Next steps\n- Write up the formal d\u2013dimensional proof (statements of c_d, multiplicity lemma, slice lifting lemma, and the inductive theorem) for proofs.md.\n- Quantitative direction: attempt to bound the number of unique colors from below. Two tractable regimes:\n  (a) Single\u2013coordinate sparse regime (all slices along one coordinate have \u22641 point): every edge between consecutive levels gives a unique color; quantify how many such edges exist when multiple coordinates are sparse.\n  (b) Coordinatewise\u2013injective regime: using the multiplicity lemma, any edge with a mixed sign\u2013type (both + and \u2212 present) realizes a unique color; estimate the count of mixed-sign edges via poset antichain/chain decompositions (Sperner\u2013type arguments).\n- Extend the multiplicity-based uniqueness checks to structured families (grids, monotone layers) and search for extremal constructions that minimize unique colors under c_d.\n"
