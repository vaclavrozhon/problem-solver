  "content": "# Ideas\n- Extend the clean d=3 proof to all dimensions d\u22652 with the same coloring scheme c_d(T,\u2113). The two key ingredients are: (i) a slice\u2013lifting lemma that uses the d\u22121 result on a coordinate hyperplane and (ii) a top\u2013two\u2013levels lemma when every slice along the last coordinate contains \u22641 point. Both rely on the fact that c_d records which coordinates are equal (E(T)) and the full lower corner \u2113.\n- Provide fully rigorous statements and proofs for these two lemmas and the resulting induction.\n\n# Definitions (general d)\n- For u\u2260v\u2208[n]^d define the sign vector \u03c3(u,v)\u2208{\u22121,0,+1}^d\\{0}^d by coordinatewise sign. Let T=[\u03c3] modulo global sign (flipping all nonzero signs). Zero coordinates remain zero, so E(T):={i: \u03c3_i=0} and J(T):=[d]\\E(T) are well-defined.\n- The lower corner \u2113(u,v)\u2208[n]^d is the coordinatewise minimum.\n- Define c_d(uv)=(T(e),\u2113(u,v)).\n\n# Lemma A (Slice\u2013lifting, general d)\nFix t\u2208[n] and let U_d[t]=U\u2229{x\u2208[n]^d: x_d=t}. If |U_d[t]|\u22652, then G[U] contains an edge whose c_d\u2013color is unique in G[U].\n\nProof. Consider G[U_d[t]] and identify each point with its first d\u22121 coordinates. By the d\u22121 theorem, there is an edge e\u2032 inside the slice with a unique color (for c_{d\u22121}) within the slice. For any in\u2013slice edge e, the type T has d\u2208E(T) and c_d(e) records \u2113_d=t and the (d\u22121)\u2013dimensional lower corner on the remaining coordinates. Thus two in\u2013slice edges have the same c_d\u2013color iff they have the same c_{d\u22121}\u2013color. Hence c_d(e\u2032) is unique among in\u2013slice edges. No outside edge can share its color: any outside edge has d\u2209E(T) (its endpoints differ in the last coordinate), while c_d(e\u2032) has d\u2208E(T). Therefore c_d(e\u2032) is unique in G[U]. \u220e\n\n# Lemma B (Top two levels, general d)\nAssume |U|\u22652 and each last\u2013coordinate slice U_d[s] has size \u22641. Let the realized last\u2013coordinate values be s_1<\u22ef<s_m with m\u22652. Let p,q\u2208U satisfy p_d=s_{m\u22121}, q_d=s_m. Then c_d(pq) is unique in G[U].\n\nProof. If f=uv has c_d(f)=c_d(pq), then \u2113_d(f)=\u2113_d(pq)=s_{m\u22121}. Thus one endpoint has last coordinate s_{m\u22121} and the other has last coordinate >s_{m\u22121}. By the slice\u2013size \u22641 assumption and by definition of s_{m\u22121}, the unique vertex in U with last coordinate s_{m\u22121} is p; and the only realized level above s_{m\u22121} is s_m, with unique vertex q. Hence f=pq, proving uniqueness. \u220e\n\n# Theorem (All d\u22652)\nFor every U\u2286[n]^d with |U|\u22652, there exists an edge in G[U] whose color under c_d appears exactly once in G[U].\n\nProof. Induct on d. Base d=2 is the provided theorem. For d\u22653: if some last\u2013coordinate slice U_d[t] has size \u22652, apply Lemma A and the inductive hypothesis. Otherwise, every slice has size \u22641, and Lemma B yields a unique color. \u220e\n\n# Examples\n- d=4, slice case: If U contains two points with last coordinate t, the d=3 result on that slice yields a unique in\u2013slice edge whose 4D color is unique globally (since c_4 records d\u2208E(T) and \u2113_d=t).\n- d=4, no\u2013slice case: If U has last\u2013coordinate levels s_1<\u22ef<s_m and each U_d[s_i] has \u22641 point, the edge between the unique vertices at s_{m\u22121}, s_m is uniquely colored by Lemma B.\n\n# Obstacles\n- None significant: the key is that c_d\u2019s label explicitly encodes E(T) and \u2113, preventing cross\u2013slice collisions and making the top\u2013two\u2013levels argument immediate.\n\n# Next steps\n- Quantitative questions: lower bounds on the number of uniquely colored edges as a function of |U| and d; extremal configurations minimizing unique colors.\n- Alternative multiplicity formulas: for selected families of types (e.g., with a prescribed set of zero coordinates), derive product counts generalizing the 2D r\u00b7s formula, potentially useful for quantitative bounds.\n"
