# Ideas
- Extend the clean d=3 proof to all dimensions d≥2 with the same coloring scheme c_d(T,ℓ). The two key ingredients are: (i) a slice–lifting lemma that uses the d−1 result on a coordinate hyperplane and (ii) a top–two–levels lemma when every slice along the last coordinate contains ≤1 point. Both rely on the fact that c_d records which coordinates are equal (E(T)) and the full lower corner ℓ.
- Provide fully rigorous statements and proofs for these two lemmas and the resulting induction.

# Definitions (general d)
- For u≠v∈[n]^d define the sign vector σ(u,v)∈{−1,0,+1}^d\{0}^d by coordinatewise sign. Let T=[σ] modulo global sign (flipping all nonzero signs). Zero coordinates remain zero, so E(T):={i: σ_i=0} and J(T):=[d]\E(T) are well-defined.
- The lower corner ℓ(u,v)∈[n]^d is the coordinatewise minimum.
- Define c_d(uv)=(T(e),ℓ(u,v)).

# Lemma A (Slice–lifting, general d)
Fix t∈[n] and let U_d[t]=U∩{x∈[n]^d: x_d=t}. If |U_d[t]|≥2, then G[U] contains an edge whose c_d–color is unique in G[U].

Proof. Consider G[U_d[t]] and identify each point with its first d−1 coordinates. By the d−1 theorem, there is an edge e′ inside the slice with a unique color (for c_{d−1}) within the slice. For any in–slice edge e, the type T has d∈E(T) and c_d(e) records ℓ_d=t and the (d−1)–dimensional lower corner on the remaining coordinates. Thus two in–slice edges have the same c_d–color iff they have the same c_{d−1}–color. Hence c_d(e′) is unique among in–slice edges. No outside edge can share its color: any outside edge has d∉E(T) (its endpoints differ in the last coordinate), while c_d(e′) has d∈E(T). Therefore c_d(e′) is unique in G[U]. ∎

# Lemma B (Top two levels, general d)
Assume |U|≥2 and each last–coordinate slice U_d[s] has size ≤1. Let the realized last–coordinate values be s_1<⋯<s_m with m≥2. Let p,q∈U satisfy p_d=s_{m−1}, q_d=s_m. Then c_d(pq) is unique in G[U].

Proof. If f=uv has c_d(f)=c_d(pq), then ℓ_d(f)=ℓ_d(pq)=s_{m−1}. Thus one endpoint has last coordinate s_{m−1} and the other has last coordinate >s_{m−1}. By the slice–size ≤1 assumption and by definition of s_{m−1}, the unique vertex in U with last coordinate s_{m−1} is p; and the only realized level above s_{m−1} is s_m, with unique vertex q. Hence f=pq, proving uniqueness. ∎

# Theorem (All d≥2)
For every U⊆[n]^d with |U|≥2, there exists an edge in G[U] whose color under c_d appears exactly once in G[U].

Proof. Induct on d. Base d=2 is the provided theorem. For d≥3: if some last–coordinate slice U_d[t] has size ≥2, apply Lemma A and the inductive hypothesis. Otherwise, every slice has size ≤1, and Lemma B yields a unique color. ∎

# Examples
- d=4, slice case: If U contains two points with last coordinate t, the d=3 result on that slice yields a unique in–slice edge whose 4D color is unique globally (since c_4 records d∈E(T) and ℓ_d=t).
- d=4, no–slice case: If U has last–coordinate levels s_1<⋯<s_m and each U_d[s_i] has ≤1 point, the edge between the unique vertices at s_{m−1}, s_m is uniquely colored by Lemma B.

# Obstacles
- None significant: the key is that c_d’s label explicitly encodes E(T) and ℓ, preventing cross–slice collisions and making the top–two–levels argument immediate.

# Next steps
- Quantitative questions: lower bounds on the number of uniquely colored edges as a function of |U| and d; extremal configurations minimizing unique colors.
- Alternative multiplicity formulas: for selected families of types (e.g., with a prescribed set of zero coordinates), derive product counts generalizing the 2D r·s formula, potentially useful for quantitative bounds.
