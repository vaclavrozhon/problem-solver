These might involve properties of the coloring or structural properties of the induced subgraphs.\n- **Obstacles**: Identify potential difficulties in proving the main statement or the candidate lemmas.\n- **Next moves**: Based on insights from the above steps, outline potential strategies for moving forward.\n\n### Small examples\nFor $n=2$, the graph $G$ has $8$ vertices and several edges. Each edge type appears multiple times, but due to the coloring scheme, it's possible to find edges with unique colors, especially considering the minima and common values in coordinates.\n\nFor $n=3$, complexity increases, but the principle remains the same. By carefully examining specific subsets $U$, we can observe that edges within these subsets can indeed have unique colors, thanks to the detailed nature of the coloring scheme.\n\n### Candidate lemmas\n1. **Lemma on uniqueness within slices**: For any subset $U$ confined to a plane where one coordinate is constant (a slice), there exists at least one edge with a unique color. This could leverage the detailed structure of the color map.\n\n### Obstacles\n- Proving the lemma for all possible configurations within slices might be challenging due to the high variability in edge types and colors.\n\n### Next moves\n- Formally define and attempt to prove the candidate lemma for uniqueness within slices. This could involve constructing a detailed argument based on the types of edges and their colors within such a constrained subset of $V(G)$.\n- Explore if a similar principle can be applied to subsets that are not confined to slices but perhaps share other commonalities.",
