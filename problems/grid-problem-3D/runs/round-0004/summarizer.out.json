  "summary_md": "Last round produced a concise, complete proof for d=3 using the supplied d=2 proof. The argument splits on a coordinate (wlog z): (i) if some z\u2013slice U\u2229{z=t} has \u22652 points, apply the d=2 theorem on that slice and lift uniqueness to 3D since c_3 records equal coordinates (\u2113_z=t); (ii) otherwise every z\u2013slice has \u22641 point and the edge joining the two highest z-levels has a uniquely determined \u2113_z and thus a unique c_3\u2013color. A multiplicity factorization A_+\u00b7A_- was given as an alternate viewpoint, and an inductive template for general d was outlined.
