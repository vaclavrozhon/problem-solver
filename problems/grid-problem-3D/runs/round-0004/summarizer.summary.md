Last round produced a concise, complete proof for d=3 using the supplied d=2 proof. The argument splits on a coordinate (wlog z): (i) if some z–slice U∩{z=t} has ≥2 points, apply the d=2 theorem on that slice and lift uniqueness to 3D since c_3 records equal coordinates (ℓ_z=t); (ii) otherwise every z–slice has ≤1 point and the edge joining the two highest z-levels has a uniquely determined ℓ_z and thus a unique c_3–color. A multiplicity factorization A_+·A_- was given as an alternate viewpoint, and an inductive template for general d was outlined.
