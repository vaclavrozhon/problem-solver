  "feedback_md": "All four provers reached the correct two-case split that solves d=3 cleanly: (A) if a coordinate slice contains \u22652 points, apply the given d=2 theorem on that slice and lift uniqueness because c_3 records equal coordinates and the corresponding \u2113-entry; (B) otherwise, use the last coordinate with singleton slices and take the edge between the top two realized levels to force a unique \u2113_z, hence a unique color.\n\nKey audit points:\n- The slice-lifting step is uniformly correct across submissions. Equality of c_3 labels forces the equal-coordinate index (in E(T)) and its value (via \u2113), so any color match lies in the same slice and reduces to equality of the 2D color.\n- The \u201ctop-two z-levels\u201d lemma is valid as stated by Provers 3/4: when each z-slice has \u22641 point and z_{m-1}<z_m are the top two realized levels, any edge with \u2113_z=z_{m-1} must be exactly {z=z_{m-1}} joined to the unique point above, i.e., the top. This pins down a unique edge and thus a unique color. The counterexample given by Prover 2 misapplies the lemma (it considers \u2113_z at the lowest level, not at the second-highest). No contradiction arises with the actual statement.\n- Prover 1\u2019s \u201cgeneral position\u201d alternative (full injectivity) is correct but stronger than needed for d=3.\n- Provers 2/3\u2019s multiplicity facts (r\u00b7s and A_+\u00b7A_\u2212) are correct provided an orientation representative for T is fixed; they are useful for extensions but unnecessary for the minimal 3D proof.\n\nNext steps: (i) Finalize and archive the concise d=3 proof (slice-lifting + top-two levels). (ii) Extend to general d by induction using the same dichotomy; the A_+\u00b7A_\u2212 multiplicity lemma provides a convenient formalism. (iii) Explore quantitative bounds on the number of uniquely colored edges.\n",

Consider the edge between the unique points at z_{m-1} and z_m. Any edge f with the same color must have the same lower-corner z-entry, \u2113_z(f)=z_{m-1}. This forces one endpoint to be the unique point at z=z_{m-1} and the other to be at some z>z_{m-1}. Since z_m is the only realized level above z_{m-1}, the partner is uniquely the point at z_m. Hence f is exactly this top-two edge, so its color is unique.\n\nNote the lemma uses the second-highest realized level (z_{m-1}). Examples showing multiple [+++] edges with the same lower corner at a lower level (e.g., using the minimum z) do not contradict this lemma.\n\nPlan forward: (i) Keep the d=3 proof as slice-lifting + top-two z-levels. (ii) Extend to general d via the same dichotomy on the last coordinate. The multiplicity framework A_+\u00b7A_- provides a useful general tool but is not needed for the minimal existence proof."

    "content": "## Generalization to dimension d\n\nLet d\u22652 and V=[n]^d. For u\u2260v\u2208V, let \u03c3(u,v)\u2208{\u22121,0,+1}^d\\setminus\\{0\\} be the coordinatewise sign vector. The type is T(e)=[\u03c3(u,v)] modulo global sign. Let E(T)=\\{i: \u03c3_i=0\\} and J(T)=[d]\\setminus E(T). Define the lower corner \u2113(u,v)\u2208[n]^d by \u2113_i(u,v)=\\min\\{u_i,v_i\\}. Define c_d(uv)=(T(e),\u2113(u,v)).\n\nLemma (slice lifting, general d). Fix r\u2208[d] and t\u2208[n]. Let U_{r=t}=U\u2229\\{x\u2208[n]^d: x_r=t\\}. If |U_{r=t}|\u22652 and an edge e in G[U_{r=t}] has a unique color under c_{d\u22121} on the remaining d\u22121 coordinates, then e has a unique color under c_d in G[U].\n\nProof. Any in-slice edge has r\u2208E(T) and \u2113_r=t. If c_d(f)=c_d(e), then r\u2208E(T(f)) and \u2113_r(f)=t, so f also lies in U_{r=t}; equality of c_d labels now implies equality of the induced (d\u22121)-dimensional color. By uniqueness in the slice, f=e. \u25a1\n\nLemma (top two levels, general d). Suppose each last-coordinate slice U_{d=t} has size \u22641 and |U|\u22652. Let the realized last-coordinate values be t_1<\u22ef<t_m, m\u22652, and let p,q\u2208U satisfy p_d=t_{m\u22121}, q_d=t_m. Then c_d(pq) is unique in G[U].\n\nProof. If c_d(f)=c_d(pq), then \u2113_d(f)=\u2113_d(pq)=t_{m\u22121}. Thus one endpoint of f has last coordinate t_{m\u22121} (hence is p) and the other has last coordinate >t_{m\u22121}. As t_m is the only realized value above t_{m\u22121}, that endpoint is q. Hence f=pq. \u25a1\n\nTheorem (all d\u22652). For every U\u2286[n]^d with |U|\u22652, the induced subgraph G[U] contains an edge whose color under c_d appears exactly once in G[U].\n\nProof. Induct on d. The base d=2 is given by the provided theorem. For d\u22653, fix the last coordinate. If some slice U_{d=t} has \u22652 points, apply the induction hypothesis in that slice and lift by the slice-lifting lemma. Otherwise, each last-coordinate slice has size \u22641; the top-two-levels lemma yields a unique color. \u25a1\n\nRemark. The d=3 result from the main task is the special case d=3 of this theorem."
