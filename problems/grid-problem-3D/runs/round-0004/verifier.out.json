  "feedback_md": "The prover's approach to demonstrating the existence of an edge with a unique color in any vertex subset $U \\subseteq [n]^3$ with $|U| \\ge 2$ under the specified coloring scheme shows a thoughtful engagement with the problem. However, the progress report lacks mathematical rigor and fails to provide concrete proofs or methodologies that would convincingly support the claims made. The exploration of small examples ($n=2$ and $n=3$) is a good starting point, but the leap from these observations to general conclusions is not substantiated with rigorous argumentation or proof. The candidate lemma on uniqueness within slices is interesting but is presented without a formal proof or a clear strategy for addressing the identified obstacles. The variability in edge types and colors, while acknowledged as a challenge, is not systematically tackled. To move forward, the prover needs to formalize the observations made from small examples into generalizable patterns or principles and provide a rigorous proof or counterexample for the candidate lemma. Additionally, exploring structural properties of the graph and the coloring scheme in more depth could yield new insights or approaches.",
