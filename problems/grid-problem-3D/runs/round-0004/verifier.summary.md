• Small examples ($n=2$ and $n=3$) suggest the possibility of finding edges with unique colors, but lack generalization to larger $n$.
• The candidate lemma on uniqueness within slices is promising but lacks formal proof and consideration of all possible configurations.
• Acknowledgment of variability in edge types and colors as an obstacle, but without a clear strategy for overcoming it.
• Next steps should include formalizing observations into proofs, addressing the variability in configurations rigorously, and exploring structural properties of the graph and coloring scheme.
