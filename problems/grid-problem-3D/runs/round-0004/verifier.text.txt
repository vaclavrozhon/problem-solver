{"feedback_md":"All four provers reached the correct two-case split that solves d=3 cleanly: (A) if a coordinate slice contains ≥2 points, apply the given d=2 theorem on that slice and lift uniqueness because c_3 records equal coordinates and the corresponding ℓ-entry; (B) otherwise, use the last coordinate with singleton slices and take the edge between the top two realized levels to force a unique ℓ_z, hence a unique color.\n\nKey audit points:\n- The slice-lifting step is uniformly correct across submissions. Equality of c_3 labels forces the equal-coordinate index (in E(T)) and its value (via ℓ), so any color match lies in the same slice and reduces to equality of the 2D color.\n- The “top-two z-levels” lemma is valid as stated by Provers 3/4: when each z-slice has ≤1 point and z_{m-1}<z_m are the top two realized levels, any edge with ℓ_z=z_{m-1} must be exactly {z=z_{m-1}} joined to the unique point above, i.e., the top. This pins down a unique edge and thus a unique color. The counterexample given by Prover 2 misapplies the lemma (it considers ℓ_z at the lowest level, not at the second-highest). No contradiction arises with the actual statement.\n- Prover 1’s “general position” alternative (full injectivity) is correct but stronger than needed for d=3.\n- Provers 2/3’s multiplicity facts (r·s and A_+·A_−) are correct provided an orientation representative for T is fixed; they are useful for extensions but unnecessary for the minimal 3D proof.\n\nNext steps: (i) Finalize and archive the concise d=3 proof (slice-lifting + top-two levels). (ii) Extend to general d by induction using the same dichotomy; the A_+·A_− multiplicity lemma provides a convenient formalism. (iii) Explore quantitative bounds on the number of uniquely colored edges.\n","summary_md":"Adopt the minimal d=3 proof: slice-lifting from the provided d=2 theorem plus the top-two-levels lemma when each last-coordinate slice is a singleton.

Consider the edge between the unique points at z_{m-1} and z_m. Any edge f with the same color must have the same lower-corner z-entry, ℓ_z(f)=z_{m-1}. This forces one endpoint to be the unique point at z=z_{m-1} and the other to be at some z>z_{m-1}. Since z_m is the only realized level above z_{m-1}, the partner is uniquely the point at z_m. Hence f is exactly this top-two edge, so its color is unique.\n\nNote the lemma uses the second-highest realized level (z_{m-1}). Examples showing multiple [+++] edges with the same lower corner at a lower level (e.g., using the minimum z) do not contradict this lemma.\n\nPlan forward: (i) Keep the d=3 proof as slice-lifting + top-two z-levels.

For u≠v∈V, let σ(u,v)∈{−1,0,+1}^d\\setminus\\{0\\} be the coordinatewise sign vector. The type is T(e)=[σ(u,v)] modulo global sign. Let E(T)=\\{i: σ_i=0\\} and J(T)=[d]\\setminus E(T). Define the lower corner ℓ(u,v)∈[n]^d by ℓ_i(u,v)=\\min\\{u_i,v_i\\}. Define c_d(uv)=(T(e),ℓ(u,v)).\n\nLemma (slice lifting, general d). Fix r∈[d] and t∈[n]. Let U_{r=t}=U∩\\{x∈[n]^d: x_r=t\\}. If |U_{r=t}|≥2 and an edge e in G[U_{r=t}] has a unique color under c_{d−1} on the remaining d−1 coordinates, then e has a unique color under c_d in G[U].\n\nProof. Any in-slice edge has r∈E(T) and ℓ_r=t. If c_d(f)=c_d(e), then r∈E(T(f)) and ℓ_r(f)=t, so f also lies in U_{r=t}; equality of c_d labels now implies equality of the induced (d−1)-dimensional color. By uniqueness in the slice, f=e. □\n\nLemma (top two levels, general d). Suppose each last-coordinate slice U_{d=t} has size ≤1 and |U|≥2. Let the realized last-coordinate values be t_1<⋯<t_m, m≥2, and let p,q∈U satisfy p_d=t_{m−1}, q_d=t_m. Then c_d(pq) is unique in G[U].\n\nProof. If c_d(f)=c_d(pq), then ℓ_d(f)=ℓ_d(pq)=t_{m−1}. Thus one endpoint of f has last coordinate t_{m−1} (hence is p) and the other has last coordinate >t_{m−1}. As t_m is the only realized value above t_{m−1}, that endpoint is q. Hence f=pq. □\n\nTheorem (all d≥2). For every U⊆[n]^d with |U|≥2, the induced subgraph G[U] contains an edge whose color under c_d appears exactly once in G[U].\n\nProof. Induct on d. The base d=2 is given by the provided theorem. For d≥3, fix the last coordinate. If some slice U_{d=t} has ≥2 points, apply the induction hypothesis in that slice and lift by the slice-lifting lemma. Otherwise, each last-coordinate slice has size ≤1; the top-two-levels lemma yields a unique color. □\n\nRemark. The d=3 result from the main task is the special case d=3 of this theorem."},"output_update":null}
