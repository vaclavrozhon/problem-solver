In this round, the focus was on extending the proof strategy from $d=2$ to $d=3$. Key ideas included analyzing the behavior of the color map $c_3$ in three dimensions and categorizing edges based on sign patterns. The Pigeonhole Principle and counting arguments were identified as useful tools for establishing uniqueness in edge colors. A small example with $n=2$ was explored to illustrate the color distribution and uniqueness of edges. However, challenges remain due to the complexity of sign patterns in three dimensions, necessitating a systematic approach to account for all edge types. The next steps involve extending the proof for $d=3$, conducting further examples, and exploring combinatorial bounds.

In this round, we focused on developing the proof for the case where $d=3$. Key strategies included analyzing edge types based on sign patterns and employing combinatorial principles like the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle and the Pigeonhole Principle. We conducted examples with vertex sets to explore edge color uniqueness systematically. However, challenges remain due to the complexity of edge types in three dimensions, necessitating a more structured approach to counting and categorizing edges. The transition from $d=2$ to $d=3$ also requires clearer articulation in the proof.

In Round 0003, the focus was on developing a systematic approach to categorize and count edge types based on their sign patterns in three dimensions. The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle was highlighted as a key tool for counting edges sharing the same color, while combinatorial geometry results were noted for their relevance in understanding edge density and color types. A small example with three vertices was analyzed to illustrate the computation of edge colors. However, challenges remain in managing the complexity of sign patterns and ensuring unique edge colors. Next steps include drafting a detailed proof for $d=3$, conducting further examples, and exploring combinatorial bounds.
