\section*{Problem definition and your task}

\paragraph{The graph coloring setup}
Fix an integer $n\ge 1$ and let $[n]=\{1,2,\dots,n\}$. Consider the complete graph $G$ on the vertex set
\[
V(G)=[n]\times[n]\times[n].
\]
For two distinct vertices
\[
u=(x_1,y_1,z_1),\qquad v=(x_2,y_2,z_2),
\]
write the \emph{sign triple}
\[
s(u,v)=\big(\operatorname{sgn}(x_1-x_2),\,\operatorname{sgn}(y_1-y_2),\,\operatorname{sgn}(z_1-z_2)\big)\in\{-1,0,+1\}^3.
\]
The \emph{type} of the undirected edge $e=uv$ is the equivalence class $T=[s(u,v)]$ modulo global sign ($s$ and $-s$ define the same type); exclude $(0,0,0)$. Thus there are $(3^3-1)/2=13$ types. We denote types by patterns such as $[+,+,+]$, $[+,-,0]$, $[+,0,0]$, where $0$ indicates the corresponding coordinate is equal in the two endpoints, $+$/$-$ indicate the two endpoints differ and which way they move relative to each other.

For an edge $e=uv$ of type $T$, let $J(T)\subseteq\{x,y,z\}$ be the coordinates where the endpoints differ (those with nonzero sign), and $E(T)=\{x,y,z\}\setminus J(T)$ the coordinates where they are equal. Define the color map $c_3:E(G)\to\mathcal L$ by
\[
c_3(e)\;=\;\Bigl(T,\ (m_i)_{i\in J(T)},\ (t_i)_{i\in E(T)}\Bigr),\qquad
m_i:=\min\{u_i,v_i\},\ \ t_i:=u_i(=v_i).
\]
In words: the color records the type $T$, the minima in each coordinate where the endpoints differ, and (for bookkeeping across slices) the common value in each coordinate where they are equal. A few concrete instances:
\[
\begin{aligned}
c_3(e) &=\bigl([+,+,+],\ \min\{x_1,x_2\},\ \min\{y_1,y_2\},\ \min\{z_1,z_2\}\bigr)&&\text{if all three coordinates differ},\\
c_3(e) &=\bigl([+,-,0],\ \min\{x_1,x_2\},\ \min\{y_1,y_2\},\ z_1\bigr)&&\text{if $z_1=z_2$ and $x,y$ differ with opposite signs},\\
c_3(e) &=\bigl([+,0,0],\ \min\{x_1,x_2\},\ y_1,\ z_1\bigr)&&\text{if $y_1=y_2$ and $z_1=z_2$ (axis-parallel in $x$)}.
\end{aligned}
\]
For $U\subseteq V(G)$, let $G[U]$ denote the induced subgraph. An edge $e\in E(G[U])$ has a \emph{unique color in $U$} if no other edge of $G[U]$ has the same label $c_3(e)$.

\paragraph{Your task}
Show that for every vertex set $U\subseteq [n]^3$ with $|U|\ge 2$, there exist $u_1,u_2\in U$ such that the edge $u_1u_2$ has a color that appears exactly once in $G[U]$ under the coloring $c_3$ above.
