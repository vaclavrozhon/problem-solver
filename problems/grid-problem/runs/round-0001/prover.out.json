Let's assume $U$ consists of vertices $(x, y_1), (x, y_2), \\ldots, (x, y_m)$ ordered such that $y_1 < y_2 < \\ldots < y_m$. The edge between $(x, y_1)$ and $(x, y_2)$ is of type 4 and has a unique color $(4, x)$, as there are no other vertices in $U$ that can form an edge with $(x, y_1)$ with a lower $y$ coordinate. Similarly, for a column, the argument holds with roles of $x$ and $y$ swapped.\\n  - **How it can fail:** This argument assumes $U$ does not span more than one row or column. In cases where $U$ is more complex, the uniqueness might not hold. **Counterexample:** For $U$ containing vertices $(1,1)$, $(2,2)$, and $(3,3)$, no unique type 3 or 4 edge exists due to the diagonal arrangement.\\n\\n#### Global Structure and Partitioning: Detailed Strategy\\n\\n- **Strategy Development:** To handle densely populated areas within $U$, consider partitioning $U$ into quadrants based on the median $x$ and $y$ values of vertices in $U$. This approach aims to isolate subsets of $U$ where extreme vertices or simpler configurations might reveal uniquely colored edges more readily.\\n  - **How it can fail:** Partitioning based on median values may not always result in subsets conducive to finding uniquely colored edges, especially if $U$ is uniformly dense. **Counterexample:** A uniformly dense subset of $[n]\\\\times[n]$ may not yield simpler configurations upon partitioning.\\n\\n#### Boundary Conditions: Rigorous Exploration\\n\\n- **Hypothesis Testing:** To test the hypothesis that edges near the periphery of $U$'s bounding box are more likely to be unique, consider the geometric properties of $U$. For example, vertices at the corners of the bounding box are likely to have edges of types 1 or 2 that are unique, due to the reduced number of potential NE or SW neighbors.\\n  - **How it can fail:** This hypothesis might not hold in configurations where the density of $U$ is uniform or symmetric. **Counterexample:** In a complete $n\\\\times n$ grid, the uniform distribution of vertices negates the periphery advantage.\\n\\n### Next Steps\\n\\n- **Formalize the proof** for the uniqueness of types 3 and 4 edges in specific configurations, ensuring all possible arrangements within a single row or column are considered.\\n- **Refine the partitioning algorithm** to better identify subsets within $U$ that are likely to contain uniquely colored edges, possibly incorporating additional geometric properties of $U$.\\n- **Conduct a more detailed investigation** into the geometric properties of $U$ and their impact on the uniqueness of edge colors, specifically focusing on the hypothesis regarding boundary conditions.\",\n  \"new_files\": [],\n  \"requests_for_more_materials\": [],\n  \"next_actions_for_prover\": []\n}",
