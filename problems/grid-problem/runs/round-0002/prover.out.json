Specifically, if $U$ is arranged such that all vertices are on a single row or column, then all edges are either type 3 or 4, but with varying second coordinates, potentially leading to uniqueness.\n  - **How it can fail:** If $U$ spans multiple rows and columns, the uniqueness of types 3 and 4 edges becomes less likely due to repeated colors. **Counterexample:** Vertices $(1,1)$, $(2,2)$, and $(3,3)$ form a diagonal, making all horizontal and vertical edges non-unique.\n\n#### Detailed Global Structure Analysis\n\n- **Further Development:** To address the gap in global structure analysis, consider partitioning $U$ into smaller subsets that either form an antichain or have a clear single NE neighbor structure. This could involve dividing $U$ based on quadrants or other geometric properties.\n  - **How it can fail:** Partitioning might not always yield subsets that fit these criteria neatly. **Counterexample:** A uniformly dense subset of $[n]\\times[n]$ might not partition into subsets with the desired properties.\n\n#### Boundary Conditions Exploration\n\n- **Preliminary Hypotheses:** For larger sets $U$, the boundary conditions for unique colored edges might relate to the geometric properties of $U$. For instance, the outermost vertices in $U$ could be more likely to have unique edges, especially if they form part of an antichain or have a single NE neighbor.\n  - **How it can fail:** In highly symmetric or dense configurations, outer vertices might still not yield unique edges. **Counterexample:** A complete $n\\times n$ grid where every vertex has multiple NE neighbors.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n- **Conduct a rigorous proof** for the reconsideration of types 3 and 4 edges, focusing on their potential for uniqueness in specific configurations.\n- **Develop a method** for partitioning $U$ that increases the likelihood of finding subsets with antichains or single NE neighbors, thereby facilitating the application of Lemmas A and B.\n- **Formulate and test hypotheses** regarding boundary conditions and their impact on the uniqueness of colored edges, with a focus on geometric properties of $U$.",
