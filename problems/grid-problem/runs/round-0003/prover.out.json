In such a case, all edges are of type 4 (or type 3, respectively). If $U$ is a subset of a single row with vertices $(x, y_1), (x, y_2), \\ldots, (x, y_m)$ where $y_1 < y_2 < \\ldots < y_m$, then the edge between $(x, y_1)$ and $(x, y_2)$ has a unique color $(4, x)$, since no other edge in $U$ can have the same $x$ coordinate with a lower second coordinate.\\n  - **How it can fail:** If $U$ spans more than one row or column, the uniqueness might not hold due to the presence of multiple edges with the same $x$ (or $y$) coordinate. **Counterexample:** Vertices $(1,1)$, $(1,2)$, and $(2,1)$ do not allow for a unique type 3 or 4 edge due to their arrangement.\\n\\n#### Global Structure: Partitioning Strategy\\n\\n- **Strategy Outline:** For a general subset $U$, consider its bounding box in the $[n] \\\\times [n]$ grid. Identify the 'extreme' vertices (those at the corners of the bounding box) and analyze edges connected to these vertices. These edges are more likely to be unique, especially if they are of type 1 or 2, connecting to vertices inside the bounding box.\\n  - **How it can fail:** In densely populated areas of $U$, even extreme vertices may not yield unique edges due to multiple connections. **Counterexample:** In a dense $3 \\\\times 3$ block, corner vertices have multiple NE neighbors, complicating the uniqueness.\\n\\n#### Boundary Conditions: Hypotheses and Testing\\n\\n- **Hypothesis:** The uniqueness of an edge's color in $U$ is more likely as one moves towards the periphery of $U$'s bounding box, particularly for edges of types 1 and 2. This is due to the reduced number of potential NE or SW neighbors, increasing the chances of finding edges with unique colors.\\n  - **How it can fail:** Symmetric arrangements or configurations with uniform density might not exhibit this behavior. **Counterexample:** A complete $n \\\\times n$ grid where edges are uniformly distributed among all types.\\n\\n### Next Steps\\n\\n- **Conduct a detailed proof** for the hypothesis regarding types 3 and 4 edges, specifically in configurations where their uniqueness can be guaranteed.\\n- **Implement a partitioning algorithm** that can effectively identify subsets within $U$ conducive to finding uniquely colored edges, based on the bounding box strategy.\\n- **Experiment with various configurations** of $U$ to validate the hypothesis about boundary conditions and their impact on edge color uniqueness.\",\n  \"new_files\": [],\n  \"requests_for_more_materials\": [],\n  \"next_actions_for_prover\": []\n}",
