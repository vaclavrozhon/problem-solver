{"progress_md":"## Round 0004 — 2025-08-27T15:14:46.643532Z\n\n### Admin and scope\n- No `output.md` was provided in this round, so I cannot audit curated statements. I will instead point out issues in prior progress notes and add rigorously stated, checkable lemmas with proofs.\n\n### Corrections to earlier rounds\n- Antichain Lemma A (from the task’s summary) is correct when applied to the whole $U$ if $U$ itself is an antichain. However, in a general $U$ (not an antichain), reusing “consecutive points” from the set of maximal elements may fail to yield a unique type–2 color in $G[U]$ because extra points in $U$ can increase $r_U(\\alpha,\\beta)$ or $s_U(\\alpha,\\beta)$ beyond $1$. This gap needs care.\n- Prior sketches about types 3 and 4 were informal. Below I give exact multiplicity formulas and rigorous single-row/column lemmas.\n\n### Exact multiplicity for types 3 and 4 (and uniqueness criteria)\n- Type 4 (horizontal): For $\\alpha\\in[n]$ define for each $(\\alpha,y)\\in U$ the right-degree\n  \\[\\deg^\\to_U(\\alpha,y):=\\#\\{(x,y)\\in U:\\ x>\\alpha\\}.\\]\n  Then the total multiplicity of the color $(4,\\alpha)$ in $G[U]$ is\n  \\[\\mu_U(4,\\alpha)=\\sum_{y:\\ (\\alpha,y)\\in U}\\deg^\\to_U(\\alpha,y).\\]\n  In particular, $(4,\\alpha)$ is unique in $U$ if and only if there is exactly one row $y$ with $(\\alpha,y)\\in U$ and in that row there is exactly one vertex strictly to the right of $\\alpha$.\n- Type 3 (vertical): Dually, for $\\beta\\in[n]$ and each $(x,\\beta)\\in U$ define the up-degree\n  \\[\\deg^{\\uparrow}_U(x,\\beta):=\\#\\{(x,y)\\in U:\\ y>\\beta\\}.\\]\n  Then the total multiplicity of the color $(3,\\beta)$ in $G[U]$ is\n  \\[\\mu_U(3,\\beta)=\\sum_{x:\\ (x,\\beta)\\in U}\\deg^{\\uparrow}_U(x,\\beta).\\]\n  Hence $(3,\\beta)$ is unique in $U$ if and only if there is exactly one column $x$ with $(x,\\beta)\\in U$ and in that column there is exactly one vertex strictly above $\\beta$.\n- Why useful here: These give necessary-and-sufficient conditions for 3/4 uniqueness in $G[U]$, not just in a subconfiguration, and will be used for boundary/cross-shaped cases.\n\n### Clean single-row/single-column lemmas\n- Lemma C1 (single row). If $U\\subseteq [n]\\times\\{y_0\\}$ and $|U|\\ge2$, list its $x$-coordinates increasingly as $x_1<\\cdots<x_m$. Then the edge $((x_{m-1},y_0),(x_m,y_0))$ has color $(4,x_{m-1})$ and is unique in $U$.\n  Proof. By the type–4 multiplicity formula, only the term for $(x_{m-1},y_0)$ contributes $1$ (exactly one right neighbor), and all other terms contribute $0$. So $\\mu_U(4,x_{m-1})=1$.\n- Lemma C2 (single column). If $U\\subseteq\\{x_0\\}\\times[n]$ and $|U|\\ge2$, list its $y$-coordinates increasingly as $y_1<\\cdots<y_m$. Then the edge $((x_0,y_{m-1}),(x_0,y_m))$ has color $(3,y_{m-1})$ and is unique in $U$.\n- Why useful here: These settle degenerate “one-dimensional” cases and will be invoked as subcases in more complex configurations.\n\n### Unique–maximal case is fully solvable via types 1, 3, 4\nLet $\\preceq$ be the product order: $(a,b)\\preceq (a',b')$ if $a\\le a'$ and $b\\le b'$. Let $\\operatorname{Max}(U)$ be the set of $\\preceq$–maximal elements.\n\n- Lemma C3 (unique maximal implies unique color). If $|\\operatorname{Max}(U)|=1$, then $G[U]$ contains a uniquely colored edge.\n  Proof. Let $m=(X,Y)$ be the unique maximal point. Consider the set $S=\\{p\\in U:\\ p\\neq m,\\ p_x<X,\\ p_y<Y\\}$ of points strictly south–west of $m$.\n  Case 1: $S\\neq\\emptyset$. Let $p\\in S$ be $\\preceq$–maximal inside $S$. Then no $q\\in U\\setminus\\{m\\}$ has $q_x>p_x$ and $q_y>p_y$ (else $q\\in S$ would dominate $p$). But $m_x>p_x$ and $m_y>p_y$, so $m$ is the only NE neighbor of $p$. By the type–1 multiplicity fact, the color $(1,p_x,p_y)$ is unique in $U$.\n  Case 2: $S=\\emptyset$. Then every $u\\in U\\setminus\\{m\\}$ lies on row $Y$ or column $X$ (or both), i.e., $U\\subseteq ([n]\\times\\{Y\\})\\cup(\\{X\\}\\times[n])$. If the row part contains $\\ge2$ points, Lemma C1 gives a unique type–4 edge; otherwise the column part contains $\\ge2$ points, and Lemma C2 gives a unique type–3 edge. In either case, $G[U]$ has a uniquely colored edge. ∎\n- Why useful here: This completely resolves the case $|\\operatorname{Max}(U)|=1$ using only local degree conditions.\n\n### Toward the general case: two or more maxima\nLet $M=\\operatorname{Max}(U)$ with $|M|=k\\ge2$, ordered by increasing $x$ as $m_i=(x_i,y_i)$ with $y_1>\\cdots>y_k$ (standard for 2D maxima). For $i=1,\\dots,k-1$, define\n- $R_i := \\#\\{(x_i,y)\\in U:\\ y>y_{i+1}\\}$ (points strictly above $y_{i+1}$ in column $x_i$),\n- $S_i := \\#\\{(x,y_{i+1})\\in U:\\ x>x_i\\}$ (points strictly to the right of $x_i$ in row $y_{i+1}$).\nNote $R_i\\ge1$ and $S_i\\ge1$, since $m_i$ and $m_{i+1}$ contribute respectively.\n\n- Lemma D (clean gap yields unique type 2). If for some $i$ one has $R_i=S_i=1$, then the color $(2,x_i,y_{i+1})$ appears exactly once in $G[U]$.\n  Proof. By the type–2 multiplicity formula, $\\mu_U(2,x_i,y_{i+1})=R_i\\cdot S_i=1$.\n- Why useful here: This gives a concrete sufficient condition (entirely local to the pair of consecutive maxima) that certifies a unique edge of type 2 in the full $G[U]$.\n\nAt this stage, the $|M|\\ge2$ case reduces to establishing that either (i) some consecutive pair satisfies Lemma D, or (ii) some other local uniqueness (types 1, 3, or 4) must occur if all pairs fail $R_i=S_i=1$.\n\n### Examples and checks\n- 2×2 grid $U=\\{(1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(2,2)\\}$: Here $M=\\{(2,2)\\}$ (unique maximal), so Lemma C3 applies. Indeed $(1,1)$ has exactly one NE neighbor $(2,2)$; color $(1,1,1)$ is unique.\n- Cross shape: $U\\subseteq ([n]\\times\\{Y\\})\\cup(\\{X\\}\\times[n])$ with at least two points on row or column side. Lemma C1 or C2 produces a unique type–4 or type–3 edge, respectively.\n- Antichain $U$ (no two share a column or a row): Lemma A (from the problem’s notes) certifies a unique type–2 edge inside $U$. Note: to conclude uniqueness in $G[U]$, one must ensure $r_U=s_U=1$ for that $(\\alpha,\\beta)$; this holds automatically because in an antichain the relevant column and row each contain exactly the one needed point.\n\n### Obstacles remaining\n- The main unresolved case: $|M|\\ge2$ but for every consecutive pair $(m_i,m_{i+1})$ at least one of $R_i, S_i$ exceeds $1$. It is not yet proved that this forces a unique color of some type. A naive counting doesn’t immediately yield a contradiction.\n\n### Next steps (concrete and auditable)\n1) Prove a dichotomy for $|M|\\ge2$: either Lemma D holds for some $i$, or there exists $p\\in U$ with exactly one NE neighbor (yielding unique type–1). The intended route is to analyze the “extra” points counted in the surpluses $(R_i-1)$ and $(S_i-1)$, and locate a point that becomes maximal in the SW region of some $m_j$ and hence has exactly one NE neighbor.\n2) If step 1 stalls, attempt a complementary dichotomy using the set of minimal elements $\\operatorname{Min}(U)$: argue symmetrically that abundant failures of Lemma D across maxima force a unique type–3 or type–4 color via the exact multiplicity formulas.\n3) Validate the dichotomies on small worst-case constructions (dense “staircase” sets) to refine the local criteria.\n\n### Summary of new, rigorously proved pieces this round\n- Exact multiplicity formulas for types 3 and 4, with necessary-and-sufficient uniqueness criteria.\n- Lemma C1 and Lemma C2: single row/column guarantee a unique color of type 4/3.\n- Lemma C3: if $U$ has a unique maximal element, then $G[U]$ has a uniquely colored edge (type 1 in the SW-rich case; otherwise types 3/4 via cross-shape reduction).\n- Lemma D: a clean gap between consecutive maxima certifies a unique type–2 color in the full $G[U]$.\n\nThese settle all cases with $|\\operatorname{Max}(U)|=1$ and provide a sharp sufficient condition when $|\\operatorname{Max}(U)|\\ge2$. The remaining work is to force such a condition or an alternative unique color when the condition fails for all consecutive maximal pairs."}
