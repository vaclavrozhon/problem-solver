  "summary_md": "Round 0004 produced a suite of rigorous, checkable lemmas that settle many base cases and clarify the remaining obstruction. Exact global multiplicity formulas were proved for all four edge types: type-1 equals the number of NE neighbors of its SW endpoint; type-2 multiplicity is r_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)\u00b7s_U(\u03b1,\u03b2); types 3 and 4 are given by explicit row/column sums, yielding necessary-and-sufficient uniqueness tests. Single-row/column lemmas (C1/C2, E/F) and the unique-maximal lemma (C3) are proved and used. For multiple maxima, Lemma D shows a clean gap (R_i=S_i=1) between consecutive maxima gives a unique type-2 color. Theorem verified on many structured families (all |U|=3, any row/column with \u22653 points, certain 2\u00d72 \u2018\u2018clean margin\u2019\u2019 rectangles). Main remaining obstacle: configurations with |Max(U)|\u22652 where every consecutive pair has at least one of R_i,S_i>1. Next steps propose a gap-dichotomy or symmetric minimal-element approach and counting checks on worst-case \u2018\u2018staircase\u2019\u2019 examples.
