Exact global multiplicity formulas were proved for all four edge types: type-1 equals the number of NE neighbors of its SW endpoint; type-2 multiplicity is r_U(α,β)·s_U(α,β); types 3 and 4 are given by explicit row/column sums, yielding necessary-and-sufficient uniqueness tests. Single-row/column lemmas (C1/C2, E/F) and the unique-maximal lemma (C3) are proved and used. For multiple maxima, Lemma D shows a clean gap (R_i=S_i=1) between consecutive maxima gives a unique type-2 color. Theorem verified on many structured families (all |U|=3, any row/column with ≥3 points, certain 2×2 ‘‘clean margin’’ rectangles). Main remaining obstacle: configurations with |Max(U)|≥2 where every consecutive pair has at least one of R_i,S_i>1. Next steps propose a gap-dichotomy or symmetric minimal-element approach and counting checks on worst-case ‘‘staircase’’ examples.
