You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md and output.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers
- notes.md (summary so far)
- output.md (rigorously proven results so far)

Guidelines:
- notes.md: should be a readable running log of interesting work. Prefer appending. Replace only if old notes are clearly misleading. Remember -- notes should be self-contained and should make sense even without seeing outputs of past provers. 
- output.md: should be concise and rigorous. It should contain only fully proven theorems that are clearly an interesting step towards the solution (or the solution itself). The beginning of the file is a clear list of interesting theorems you can prove. From the statement of the theorem it has to be clear that this constitutes nontrivial progress towards solution. The rest of the file contains a fully rigorous list of the proofs of the theorems. Keep only proven theorems with clear proofs. If a statement is flawed and you cannot fix it, remove it from output.md and instead add it to notes.md with explanation.
- Be careful with the booleans `new_notes_append` and `new_outputs_append`: default is True (append). Use False only when deliberately rewriting everything.

Tasks:
1) Audit rigor: identify unjustified steps, false statements, missing lemmas; produce minimal counterexamples.
2) Triage value: separate genuine progress from noise.
3) Guide next steps: propose what provers should try next.

[{"prover_id": "01", "progress_md": "## Round 0004 \u2014 2025-08-27T15:14:46.643532Z\n\n### Admin and scope\n- No `output.md` was provided in this round, so I cannot audit curated statements. I will instead point out issues in prior progress notes and add rigorously stated, checkable lemmas with proofs.\n\n### Corrections to earlier rounds\n- Antichain Lemma A (from the task\u2019s summary) is correct when applied to the whole $U$ if $U$ itself is an antichain. However, in a general $U$ (not an antichain), reusing \u201cconsecutive points\u201d from the set of maximal elements may fail to yield a unique type\u20132 color in $G[U]$ because extra points in $U$ can increase $r_U(\\alpha,\\beta)$ or $s_U(\\alpha,\\beta)$ beyond $1$. This gap needs care.\n- Prior sketches about types 3 and 4 were informal. Below I give exact multiplicity formulas and rigorous single-row/column lemmas.\n\n### Exact multiplicity for types 3 and 4 (and uniqueness criteria)\n- Type 4 (horizontal): For $\\alpha\\in[n]$ define for each $(\\alpha,y)\\in U$ the right-degree\n  \\[\\deg^\\to_U(\\alpha,y):=\\#\\{(x,y)\\in U:\\ x>\\alpha\\}.\\]\n  Then the total multiplicity of the color $(4,\\alpha)$ in $G[U]$ is\n  \\[\\mu_U(4,\\alpha)=\\sum_{y:\\ (\\alpha,y)\\in U}\\deg^\\to_U(\\alpha,y).\\]\n  In particular, $(4,\\alpha)$ is unique in $U$ if and only if there is exactly one row $y$ with $(\\alpha,y)\\in U$ and in that row there is exactly one vertex strictly to the right of $\\alpha$.\n- Type 3 (vertical): Dually, for $\\beta\\in[n]$ and each $(x,\\beta)\\in U$ define the up-degree\n  \\[\\deg^{\\uparrow}_U(x,\\beta):=\\#\\{(x,y)\\in U:\\ y>\\beta\\}.\\]\n  Then the total multiplicity of the color $(3,\\beta)$ in $G[U]$ is\n  \\[\\mu_U(3,\\beta)=\\sum_{x:\\ (x,\\beta)\\in U}\\deg^{\\uparrow}_U(x,\\beta).\\]\n  Hence $(3,\\beta)$ is unique in $U$ if and only if there is exactly one column $x$ with $(x,\\beta)\\in U$ and in that column there is exactly one vertex strictly above $\\beta$.\n- Why useful here: These give necessary-and-sufficient conditions for 3/4 uniqueness in $G[U]$, not just in a subconfiguration, and will be used for boundary/cross-shaped cases.\n\n### Clean single-row/single-column lemmas\n- Lemma C1 (single row). If $U\\subseteq [n]\\times\\{y_0\\}$ and $|U|\\ge2$, list its $x$-coordinates increasingly as $x_1<\\cdots<x_m$. Then the edge $((x_{m-1},y_0),(x_m,y_0))$ has color $(4,x_{m-1})$ and is unique in $U$.\n  Proof. By the type\u20134 multiplicity formula, only the term for $(x_{m-1},y_0)$ contributes $1$ (exactly one right neighbor), and all other terms contribute $0$. So $\\mu_U(4,x_{m-1})=1$.\n- Lemma C2 (single column). If $U\\subseteq\\{x_0\\}\\times[n]$ and $|U|\\ge2$, list its $y$-coordinates increasingly as $y_1<\\cdots<y_m$. Then the edge $((x_0,y_{m-1}),(x_0,y_m))$ has color $(3,y_{m-1})$ and is unique in $U$.\n- Why useful here: These settle degenerate \u201cone-dimensional\u201d cases and will be invoked as subcases in more complex configurations.\n\n### Unique\u2013maximal case is fully solvable via types 1, 3, 4\nLet $\\preceq$ be the product order: $(a,b)\\preceq (a',b')$ if $a\\le a'$ and $b\\le b'$. Let $\\operatorname{Max}(U)$ be the set of $\\preceq$\u2013maximal elements.\n\n- Lemma C3 (unique maximal implies unique color). If $|\\operatorname{Max}(U)|=1$, then $G[U]$ contains a uniquely colored edge.\n  Proof. Let $m=(X,Y)$ be the unique maximal point. Consider the set $S=\\{p\\in U:\\ p\\neq m,\\ p_x<X,\\ p_y<Y\\}$ of points strictly south\u2013west of $m$.\n  Case 1: $S\\neq\\emptyset$. Let $p\\in S$ be $\\preceq$\u2013maximal inside $S$. Then no $q\\in U\\setminus\\{m\\}$ has $q_x>p_x$ and $q_y>p_y$ (else $q\\in S$ would dominate $p$). But $m_x>p_x$ and $m_y>p_y$, so $m$ is the only NE neighbor of $p$. By the type\u20131 multiplicity fact, the color $(1,p_x,p_y)$ is unique in $U$.\n  Case 2: $S=\\emptyset$. Then every $u\\in U\\setminus\\{m\\}$ lies on row $Y$ or column $X$ (or both), i.e., $U\\subseteq ([n]\\times\\{Y\\})\\cup(\\{X\\}\\times[n])$. If the row part contains $\\ge2$ points, Lemma C1 gives a unique type\u20134 edge; otherwise the column part contains $\\ge2$ points, and Lemma C2 gives a unique type\u20133 edge. In either case, $G[U]$ has a uniquely colored edge. \u220e\n- Why useful here: This completely resolves the case $|\\operatorname{Max}(U)|=1$ using only local degree conditions.\n\n### Toward the general case: two or more maxima\nLet $M=\\operatorname{Max}(U)$ with $|M|=k\\ge2$, ordered by increasing $x$ as $m_i=(x_i,y_i)$ with $y_1>\\cdots>y_k$ (standard for 2D maxima). For $i=1,\\dots,k-1$, define\n- $R_i := \\#\\{(x_i,y)\\in U:\\ y>y_{i+1}\\}$ (points strictly above $y_{i+1}$ in column $x_i$),\n- $S_i := \\#\\{(x,y_{i+1})\\in U:\\ x>x_i\\}$ (points strictly to the right of $x_i$ in row $y_{i+1}$).\nNote $R_i\\ge1$ and $S_i\\ge1$, since $m_i$ and $m_{i+1}$ contribute respectively.\n\n- Lemma D (clean gap yields unique type 2). If for some $i$ one has $R_i=S_i=1$, then the color $(2,x_i,y_{i+1})$ appears exactly once in $G[U]$.\n  Proof. By the type\u20132 multiplicity formula, $\\mu_U(2,x_i,y_{i+1})=R_i\\cdot S_i=1$.\n- Why useful here: This gives a concrete sufficient condition (entirely local to the pair of consecutive maxima) that certifies a unique edge of type 2 in the full $G[U]$.\n\nAt this stage, the $|M|\\ge2$ case reduces to establishing that either (i) some consecutive pair satisfies Lemma D, or (ii) some other local uniqueness (types 1, 3, or 4) must occur if all pairs fail $R_i=S_i=1$.\n\n### Examples and checks\n- 2\u00d72 grid $U=\\{(1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(2,2)\\}$: Here $M=\\{(2,2)\\}$ (unique maximal), so Lemma C3 applies. Indeed $(1,1)$ has exactly one NE neighbor $(2,2)$; color $(1,1,1)$ is unique.\n- Cross shape: $U\\subseteq ([n]\\times\\{Y\\})\\cup(\\{X\\}\\times[n])$ with at least two points on row or column side. Lemma C1 or C2 produces a unique type\u20134 or type\u20133 edge, respectively.\n- Antichain $U$ (no two share a column or a row): Lemma A (from the problem\u2019s notes) certifies a unique type\u20132 edge inside $U$. Note: to conclude uniqueness in $G[U]$, one must ensure $r_U=s_U=1$ for that $(\\alpha,\\beta)$; this holds automatically because in an antichain the relevant column and row each contain exactly the one needed point.\n\n### Obstacles remaining\n- The main unresolved case: $|M|\\ge2$ but for every consecutive pair $(m_i,m_{i+1})$ at least one of $R_i, S_i$ exceeds $1$. It is not yet proved that this forces a unique color of some type. A naive counting doesn\u2019t immediately yield a contradiction.\n\n### Next steps (concrete and auditable)\n1) Prove a dichotomy for $|M|\\ge2$: either Lemma D holds for some $i$, or there exists $p\\in U$ with exactly one NE neighbor (yielding unique type\u20131). The intended route is to analyze the \u201cextra\u201d points counted in the surpluses $(R_i-1)$ and $(S_i-1)$, and locate a point that becomes maximal in the SW region of some $m_j$ and hence has exactly one NE neighbor.\n2) If step 1 stalls, attempt a complementary dichotomy using the set of minimal elements $\\operatorname{Min}(U)$: argue symmetrically that abundant failures of Lemma D across maxima force a unique type\u20133 or type\u20134 color via the exact multiplicity formulas.\n3) Validate the dichotomies on small worst-case constructions (dense \u201cstaircase\u201d sets) to refine the local criteria.\n\n### Summary of new, rigorously proved pieces this round\n- Exact multiplicity formulas for types 3 and 4, with necessary-and-sufficient uniqueness criteria.\n- Lemma C1 and Lemma C2: single row/column guarantee a unique color of type 4/3.\n- Lemma C3: if $U$ has a unique maximal element, then $G[U]$ has a uniquely colored edge (type 1 in the SW-rich case; otherwise types 3/4 via cross-shape reduction).\n- Lemma D: a clean gap between consecutive maxima certifies a unique type\u20132 color in the full $G[U]$.\n\nThese settle all cases with $|\\operatorname{Max}(U)|=1$ and provide a sharp sufficient condition when $|\\operatorname{Max}(U)|\\ge2$. The remaining work is to force such a condition or an alternative unique color when the condition fails for all consecutive maximal pairs."}, {"prover_id": "02", "progress_md": "## Round 0004 \u2014 2025-08-27T15:14:46.643398Z\n\nHousekeeping.\n- There is no output.md provided; I therefore cannot check curated results for gaps. I proceed with new, fully stated and checkable lemmas/proofs, and I highlight where they apply in the overall strategy.\n\nContext reminder.\n- Vertices are points in [n]\u00d7[n]. Edge types: 1 (NE\u2013SW), 2 (NW\u2013SE), 3 (vertical), 4 (horizontal).\n- Colors: type 1 and 2 have labels (type, \u03b1, \u03b2) using \u03b1 = min x, \u03b2 = min y; type 3 has (3, \u03b2); type 4 has (4, \u03b1).\n- Previously noted and used: local multiplicities for types 1 and 2 are exact and simple. I extend this with precise multiplicity formulas for types 3 and 4 and extract uniqueness criteria. Then I prove the target statement for |U| = 3 (complete case analysis) and record several structural lemmas useful going forward.\n\n### Precise multiplicity formulas (global) for all types\n\nClaim 1 (restate and sharpen Type 1 multiplicity). For any (\u03b1,\u03b2) \u2208 [n]^2, the number of edges in G[U] with color (1,\u03b1,\u03b2) equals the number of vertices in U strictly north\u2013east of (\u03b1,\u03b2). In particular, color (1,\u03b1,\u03b2) can occur only if (\u03b1,\u03b2) \u2208 U, and then its multiplicity equals the count of NE-neighbors of (\u03b1,\u03b2).\n- Proof. Any type\u20131 edge with label (1,\u03b1,\u03b2) must have SW endpoint (\u03b1,\u03b2) (since label takes coordinate-wise minima). Conversely, each NE neighbor q of (\u03b1,\u03b2) yields exactly one edge of that color. Distinct NE neighbors give distinct edges. QED.\n\nClaim 2 (restate and sharpen Type 2 multiplicity). For any (\u03b1,\u03b2) \u2208 [n]^2, let\n- r_U(\u03b1,\u03b2) = # { (\u03b1,y) \u2208 U : y > \u03b2 } and s_U(\u03b1,\u03b2) = # { (x,\u03b2) \u2208 U : x > \u03b1 }.\nThen the number of edges in G[U] with color (2,\u03b1,\u03b2) is r_U(\u03b1,\u03b2) \u00b7 s_U(\u03b1,\u03b2). In particular, (2,\u03b1,\u03b2) is unique iff r_U(\u03b1,\u03b2) = s_U(\u03b1,\u03b2) = 1.\n- Proof. A type\u20132 edge with label (2,\u03b1,\u03b2) arises from choosing one point on the vertical ray {(\u03b1,y) : y>\u03b2} and one on the horizontal ray {(x,\u03b2) : x>\u03b1}, and conversely any such pair produces exactly one such edge. The choices multiply. QED.\n\nClaim 3 (Type 3 multiplicity). For \u03b2 \u2208 [n], define for each \u03b1 \u2208 [n] the integer v_\u03b1(\u03b2) = # { (\u03b1,y) \u2208 U : y > \u03b2 }, and the indicator 1_{\u03b1,\u03b2} = 1 if (\u03b1,\u03b2) \u2208 U, 0 otherwise. Then the number of edges colored (3,\u03b2) equals\n- T_3(\u03b2) = \u2211_{\u03b1=1}^n 1_{\u03b1,\u03b2} \u00b7 v_\u03b1(\u03b2).\nConsequently, color (3,\u03b2) is unique in U iff there is exactly one column \u03b1 with (\u03b1,\u03b2) \u2208 U and v_\u03b1(\u03b2) = 1, and for all other columns either (\u03b1,\u03b2) \u2209 U or v_\u03b1(\u03b2)=0.\n- Proof. Type\u20133 edges are vertical, and the label (3,\u03b2) means the lower endpoint has y-coordinate \u03b2. For a fixed column \u03b1, the eligible lower endpoint is (\u03b1,\u03b2) (if present), and it connects to each (\u03b1,y) with y>\u03b2, contributing v_\u03b1(\u03b2) edges. Sum over \u03b1. Uniqueness is equivalent to T_3(\u03b2)=1, which forces exactly one contributing \u03b1 and exactly one upper neighbor there. QED.\n\nClaim 4 (Type 4 multiplicity). Fix \u03b1 \u2208 [n]. For \u03b2 \u2208 [n], define h_\u03b2(\u03b1) = # { (x,\u03b2) \u2208 U : x > \u03b1 } and the indicator 1'_{\u03b1,\u03b2} = 1 if (\u03b1,\u03b2) \u2208 U, 0 otherwise. Then the number of edges colored (4,\u03b1) equals\n- T_4(\u03b1) = \u2211_{\u03b2=1}^n 1'_{\u03b1,\u03b2} \u00b7 h_\u03b2(\u03b1).\nConsequently, color (4,\u03b1) is unique in U iff there is exactly one row \u03b2 with (\u03b1,\u03b2) \u2208 U and h_\u03b2(\u03b1) = 1, and for all other rows either (\u03b1,\u03b2) \u2209 U or h_\u03b2(\u03b1)=0.\n- Proof. Analogous to Claim 3, with rows/columns interchanged. QED.\n\nWhy useful here. Claims 3\u20134 turn the previously vague intuition (\u201ctypes 3,4 repeat\u201d) into precise numerical tests for uniqueness. They also yield immediate \u201csingle-row/column witness\u201d lemmas below.\n\n### Immediate corollaries for types 3 and 4 (rigorous uniqueness triggers)\n\nLemma E (unique type 3 from a singleton row with a single vertical extension). Suppose there exists a row \u03b2 containing exactly one vertex (\u03b1,\u03b2) \u2208 U, and in column \u03b1 there is exactly one vertex above it: exactly one y>\u03b2 with (\u03b1,y) \u2208 U. Then color (3,\u03b2) is unique in G[U] and is realized by the vertical edge between (\u03b1,\u03b2) and that unique (\u03b1,y).\n- Proof. By Claim 3, T_3(\u03b2) = \u2211_\u03b1 1_{\u03b1,\u03b2} v_\u03b1(\u03b2). Only one \u03b1 contributes (the unique \u03b1 with (\u03b1,\u03b2) \u2208 U), and there v_\u03b1(\u03b2)=1 by hypothesis. Hence T_3(\u03b2)=1. QED.\n\nLemma F (unique type 4 from a singleton column with a single horizontal extension). Suppose there exists a column \u03b1 containing exactly one vertex (\u03b1,\u03b2) \u2208 U, and in row \u03b2 there is exactly one vertex to its right: exactly one x>\u03b1 with (x,\u03b2) \u2208 U. Then color (4,\u03b1) is unique in G[U] and is realized by the horizontal edge between (\u03b1,\u03b2) and that unique (x,\u03b2).\n- Proof. By Claim 4, only row \u03b2 contributes and contributes h_\u03b2(\u03b1)=1. QED.\n\nThese are small but useful \u201ccertificates\u201d of uniqueness of types 3\u20134 in concrete and checkable configurations that appear frequently when U is sparse along some row/column.\n\n### Previously stated and retained tools\n\n- Lemma A (antichain \u21d2 unique type 2). Fully applies as stated in the prompt; it gives a robust way to certify a unique type\u20132 color when U itself is an antichain.\n- Lemma B (exactly one NE neighbor \u21d2 unique type 1). Fully applies as stated; it certifies a unique type\u20131 color.\n\n### Verified special cases of the main theorem\n\nThe following sharpen the landscape of configurations for which the theorem is already settled by our toolkit.\n\nProposition P1 (All three-point sets U satisfy the theorem). For any U with |U|=3, there exists a uniquely colored edge in G[U].\n- Proof. Case split.\n  - If all 3 lie on a common row, say x_1<x_2<x_3 with common y, then the horizontal edges have colors (4,x_1),(4,x_1),(4,x_2). Thus (4,x_2) appears exactly once.\n  - If all 3 lie on a common column, similarly we obtain uniqueness via type 3: the vertical edges have colors (3,y_1),(3,y_1),(3,y_2) with y_1<y_2<y_3, so (3,y_2) is unique.\n  - Otherwise, not all three share a row or a column. If some pair shares a row, we are in the first subcase with only two on the row: then their edge has color (4,\u03b1_left) and no other edge has that color (because there is no third vertex in that same row to form a second edge with left endpoint \u03b1_left). Hence unique.\n    Likewise, if some pair shares a column, type 3 gives uniqueness.\n  - Finally, assume all three have distinct x- and y- coordinates. Order by x: p_1=(x_1,y_1), p_2=(x_2,y_2), p_3=(x_3,y_3) with x_1<x_2<x_3 and y_i all distinct.\n    \u2022 If y_1<y_2<y_3 (increasing), then p_2p_3 is type 1 with color (1,x_2,y_2), and no other edge in U bears that color (since the only possible SW endpoint yielding (1,x_2,y_2) would be (x_2,y_2), which is p_2 itself; but the other edges use p_1 as SW endpoint and thus have color (1,x_1,y_1)). Hence (1,x_2,y_2) is unique.\n    \u2022 If y_1>y_2>y_3 (decreasing), then U is an antichain. Lemma A applies: p_2p_3 has color (2,x_2,y_3) and is unique because r_U(x_2,y_3)=s_U(x_2,y_3)=1 with only p_2 above in column x_2 and only p_3 to the right in row y_3.\n    \u2022 For the remaining permutations (132, 213, 231, 312), at least one consecutive pair in x-order is of type 2 with the other point in that row/column uniquely positioned. For instance, for 132 (y_1<y_3<y_2), the edge p_2p_3 is type 2 with label (2,x_2,y_3), and exactly one point lies above (x_2,y_3) in column x_2 (namely p_2) and exactly one lies to the right of (x_2,y_3) in row y_3 (namely p_3). Hence unique. The three other patterns are symmetric variants.\n  In all cases a unique color exists. QED.\n\nProposition P2 (Three-or-more on a line). If some row (or some column) contains at least 3 points of U, then G[U] has a uniquely colored edge of type 4 (respectively, type 3).\n- Proof. For a row with x_1<\u22ef<x_k and k\u22653, the multiset of colors over horizontal edges on that row is { (4,x_1) repeated k\u22121 times, (4,x_2) repeated k\u22122 times, \u2026, (4,x_{k\u22121}) once }. Then (4,x_{k\u22121}) is unique. Vertical is analogous.\n\nProposition P3 (Singleton row/column with one extension gives unique 3/4). Lemmas E and F provide immediate certificates of uniqueness when a row (resp. column) has exactly one point and the corresponding column (resp. row) contains exactly one extension in the necessary direction.\n\nThese cover a large family of sparse/structured U and will be used as base cases in an inductive or decomposition argument.\n\n### Ideas toward the general case (and obstacles)\n\n- Idea: Two-phase dichotomy via types 1 and 2. Try to show: unless we can certify uniqueness via types 3\u20134 using Lemmas E\u2013F or via Proposition P2, we must find either a vertex with exactly one NE neighbor (unique type 1) or an L-corner (\u03b1,\u03b2) with r_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)=s_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)=1 (unique type 2). This would reduce the full theorem to a rigorous structural analysis of the \u201cno uniqueness via 3\u20134 and no single-NE\u201d regime.\n\n- Attempted approach (minimal elements layering). Let L_0 be the set of minimal elements (in the product order), remove it, let L_1 be the minimals of the remainder, etc. Each L_t is an antichain. Consecutive points in L_t in x-order give candidate labels (2, \u03b1, \u03b2) with \u03b1 from the left point and \u03b2 from the right point. In the induced subgraph on L_t alone, these are unique; the challenge is to control r_U(\u03b1,\u03b2) and s_U(\u03b1,\u03b2) against points in other layers. The obstacle is that higher layers can add extra points in the same column above \u03b2 or in the same row to the right of \u03b1, inflating r or s beyond 1. A clean \u201cseparation\u201d invariant is needed.\n\n- Obstacles encountered:\n  1) Minimal-color lexicographic arguments fail: the minimal color in lex order need not be unique (e.g., points on a strictly increasing chain yield repeated (1,\u03b1,\u03b2) from a single SW endpoint with multiple NE neighbors).\n  2) Using an antichain subset S\u2286U directly is insufficient: uniqueness of a type\u20132 color witnessed inside S can be destroyed by extra points of U in the witnessing column/row.\n\n- Concrete plan to proceed:\n  1) Strengthen the layering approach by marking, for each antichain layer L_t, its \u201cx-successor gaps\u201d: for consecutive m_i=(x_i,y_i), m_{i+1}=(x_{i+1},y_{i+1}), record (\u03b1,\u03b2)=(x_i,y_{i+1}). Investigate sufficient conditions ensuring r_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)=s_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)=1, e.g., emptiness of a certain open rectangle or \u201ctop-of-column/rightmost-in-row\u201d properties. Goal: a lemma of the form \u201cIf no vertex has exactly one NE neighbor and no line has \u22653 points, then some such (\u03b1,\u03b2) is 1\u00d71.\u201d\n  2) Develop a counting contradiction in the regime where all type\u20131 colors have multiplicity 0 or \u22652 and all type\u20132 colors have multiplicity 0 or \u22652, while also forbidding the 3\u20134 uniqueness witnesses (P2, Lemma E, Lemma F). The aim is to show this regime cannot persist.\n\n### Small additional lemmas (useful triggers)\n\nLemma G (2\u00d72 pure rectangle with clean margins \u21d2 unique type 2). Suppose U contains exactly the four corners of a rectangle {(x_1,y_1),(x_1,y_2),(x_2,y_1),(x_2,y_2)} with x_1<x_2 and y_1<y_2, and contains no other point in column x_1 above y_1 and no other point in row y_1 to the right of x_1. Then the type\u20132 color (2,x_1,y_1) is unique.\n- Proof. Here r_U(x_1,y_1)=1 (only (x_1,y_2) above) and s_U(x_1,y_1)=1 (only (x_2,y_1) to the right), so multiplicity is 1 by Claim 2. QED.\n- Why useful: it isolates a frequent local pattern certifying uniqueness of type 2 without requiring the whole U to be an antichain.\n\n### Examples that probe edge cases\n\n- Example 1 (type\u20133 uniqueness via Lemma E). U = { (2,1), (2,3), (5,5) }. Row \u03b2=1 has a singleton at (2,1); column 2 has exactly one point above (2,3). Thus color (3,1) is unique (edge (2,1)\u2013(2,3)).\n- Example 2 (type\u20134 uniqueness via Lemma F). U = { (1,4), (3,4), (2,2) }. Column \u03b1=1 is a singleton at (1,4); row 4 has exactly one to the right (3,4). Hence (4,1) is unique.\n- Example 3 (failure of naive minimal-color). U = { (1,1), (2,2), (3,3) }. Minimal color (1,1,1) occurs twice ((1,1)\u2013(2,2) and (1,1)\u2013(3,3)). Nevertheless, edge (2,2)\u2013(3,3) has unique color (1,2,2), illustrating the need to look beyond the absolute minimal label.\n\n### Next steps (concrete and checkable)\n\n1) Formalize a \u201cgap lemma\u201d on antichain layers: Given L_t and consecutive m_i=(x_i,y_i), m_{i+1}=(x_{i+1},y_{i+1}), identify simple, verifiable conditions on U ensuring r_U(x_i,y_{i+1})=s_U(x_i,y_{i+1})=1 (e.g., that m_i is topmost in column x_i and m_{i+1} is rightmost in row y_{i+1}). Prove that if no such witness exists across all layers, then a vertex with exactly one NE neighbor must exist or a 3/4 uniqueness trigger (P2, E, F) is present.\n\n2) Extend the complete verification from |U|=3 to |U|=4 by case analysis, using P2, E, F, Lemma G, and Lemmas A\u2013B. This builds confidence in the global dichotomy and may suggest an inductive invariant.\n\n3) Explore a parity/counting contradiction: Sum over \u03b2 of T_3(\u03b2) and over \u03b1 of T_4(\u03b1) under the assumption that none equals 1, while also controlling the sums of type\u20131 and type\u20132 multiplicities when \u201c=1\u201d is forbidden. The goal is to force at least one label to have multiplicity 1.\n\nSummary of progress.\n- I established precise, global multiplicity formulas for types 3\u20134 (Claims 3\u20134), yielding crisp uniqueness criteria and simple, usable triggers (Lemmas E\u2013F).\n- I provided complete, rigorous proofs for the theorem in nontrivial families: all |U|=3 sets (Proposition P1), any row/column with \u22653 points (Proposition P2), and the local 2\u00d72-with-clean-margins pattern (Lemma G).\n- I identified the key obstacle in extending antichain-based arguments to arbitrary U and outlined a concrete plan to tackle the remaining general case via layered antichains and counting.\n"}]
