In particular, the proofs of multiplicity formulas and the antichain/type\u20132 trigger are correct.\n- The earlier false global claim \u201c\u22653 on a row/column \u21d2 unique type 4/3\u201d has correctly been dropped; current statements restrict to single-line U or to singleton+extension triggers, which are correct.\n- Theorem 6 (|U|=3) includes a case \u201csome pair lies on a row (column) but not all three do; the edge of that pair has a color that cannot be duplicated elsewhere in U.\u201d This is safe because with |U|=3 there cannot be a second edge in another row (or column) realizing the same left (or lower) coordinate; duplication would require 4 points. Still, note explicitly that the argument relies on |U|=3.\n- The unique-maximal case is not yet included and was flagged previously as having a proof gap. I provide correct partial triggers toward a full resolution below.\n\n### New lemmas: unique\u2013maximal case triggers\nLet U\u2286[n]^2 have a unique maximal element m=(X,Y) in the product order, i.e., for all u\u2208U\\{m} we have u_x\u2264X and u_y\u2264Y with at least one strict inequality. Equivalently, X=max{x:(x,y)\u2208U} and Y=max{y:(x,y)\u2208U}.\nLet S={p\u2208U : p_x<X and p_y<Y} be the strictly SW set of m. Let T={x<X : (x,Y)\u2208U} (top-row x\u2019s except X) and R={y<Y : (X,y)\u2208U} (right-column y\u2019s except Y). Write\n- \u03b1\u2082 = max T if T\u2260\u2205 and \u03b1\u2082 = \u2212\u221e otherwise;\n- \u03b2\u2082 = max R if R\u2260\u2205 and \u03b2\u2082 = \u2212\u221e otherwise.\n\n- Lemma H\u2032 (boundary-threshold + SW-maximality \u21d2 unique type 1). Suppose S\u2260\u2205 and there exists p\u2208Max(S) (maximal in S under the product order) such that p_x\u2265\u03b1\u2082 and p_y\u2265\u03b2\u2082. Then p has exactly one NE neighbor in U, namely m, and the type\u20131 color (1,p_x,p_y) is unique in G[U].\n  Proof. Any NE neighbor q of p with q_x<X and q_y<Y would lie in S and satisfy q\u227bp, contradicting p\u2208Max(S). Thus NE neighbors of p lie on the top row or right column. Because p_x\u2265\u03b1\u2082, the only top-row point strictly to the right of p is (X,Y). Because p_y\u2265\u03b2\u2082, the only right-column point strictly above p is (X,Y). Hence the unique NE neighbor is m. By the type\u20131 multiplicity formula, (1,p_x,p_y) has multiplicity 1. \u220e\n  Why useful: Gives a clean, checkable certificate for unique type\u20131 in the unique-maximal regime, isolating the exact obstruction (extra NE neighbors forced by top row or right column).\n\n- Lemma K (top-row pivot \u21d2 unique type 4). If T\u2260\u2205 and the column \u03b1\u2082 contains no point below Y (i.e., (\u03b1\u2082,\u03b2)\u2209U for all \u03b2<Y), then the color (4,\u03b1\u2082) occurs exactly once in G[U], realized by the horizontal edge on the top row Y between (\u03b1\u2082,Y) and m.\n  Proof. On row Y, the only right neighbor of (\u03b1\u2082,Y) is (X,Y) (since \u03b1\u2082 is the second largest x on that row), so h_Y(\u03b1\u2082)=1. By assumption, there is no other row \u03b2 with (\u03b1\u2082,\u03b2), hence T_4(\u03b1\u2082)=h_Y(\u03b1\u2082)=1 by the type\u20134 multiplicity formula. \u220e\n  Why useful: This yields a unique color directly from the top row as soon as the \u201csecond-rightmost top-row column\u201d does not reappear elsewhere.\n\n- Lemma K\u2032 (right-column pivot \u21d2 unique type 3). If R\u2260\u2205 and the row \u03b2\u2082 contains no point to the right of X (i.e., vacuously true) and, crucially, the column X contains no point strictly between \u03b2\u2082 and Y (i.e., (X,\u03b2)\u2209U for \u03b2\u2082<\u03b2<Y), then the color (3,\u03b2\u2082) occurs exactly once, realized by the vertical edge between (X,\u03b2\u2082) and (X,Y).\n  Proof. On column X, the only point above (X,\u03b2\u2082) is (X,Y), so v_X(\u03b2\u2082)=1. If for every \u03b1\u2260X we have (\u03b1,\u03b2\u2082)\u2209U, then T_3(\u03b2\u2082)=v_X(\u03b2\u2082)=1 and we are done. More generally, it suffices to assume there is no \u03b1\u2260X with (\u03b1,\u03b2\u2082)\u2208U and any point above (\u03b1,\u03b2\u2082); in particular, if row \u03b2\u2082 is a singleton (only (X,\u03b2\u2082)), this condition holds automatically. \u220e\n  Remark. The stated form lists a sufficient condition; I keep it slightly stronger for immediate verifiability via the type\u20133 formula (no other contributor to T_3(\u03b2\u2082)).\n\nThese three lemmas together cover a substantial portion of the unique-maximal case: either a pivot on the boundary directly yields a unique type\u20133/4 color (K/K\u2032), or a SW-maximal point whose coordinates exceed the boundary thresholds yields a unique type\u20131 color (H\u2032). The remaining subcase (all p\u2208Max(S) fail p_x\u2265\u03b1\u2082 or p_y\u2265\u03b2\u2082, and every \u03b1\u2082,\u03b2\u2082 does reappear so K/K\u2032 do not fire) is now cleanly isolated for further work.\n\n### Complete proof for |U|=4 (new theorem)\n- Proposition P4 (four-point sets). If |U|=4, then G[U] has a uniquely colored edge.\n  Proof. Case 1: Some row has 3 or 4 points. Then on that row with x_1<\u22ef<x_k, k\u22653, the rightmost edge has color (4,x_{k\u22121}). To realize (4,x_{k\u22121}) elsewhere would require another row containing both (x_{k\u22121},\u03b2) and some (x,\u03b2) with x>x_{k\u22121}; with only one remaining point off the row, this is impossible. Hence (4,x_{k\u22121}) is unique. The column case is symmetric (type 3).\n  Case 2: No row and no column has \u22653 points.\n  \u2013 Subcase 2a: There exists a row with exactly 2 points whose smaller x-value \u03b1 does not occur as the left endpoint of any other horizontal edge (i.e., there is no other row containing both (\u03b1,\u03b2) and a point to its right). Then the horizontal edge on this row has color (4,\u03b1) which, by the type\u20134 formula, is unique.\n  \u2013 Subcase 2b: Otherwise, there must be two distinct rows y_1\u2260y_2, each containing exactly two points, and their left endpoints coincide at some \u03b1. Then column \u03b1 contains the two points (\u03b1,y_1),(\u03b1,y_2). Consider \u03b2=min{y_1,y_2}. For color (3,\u03b2), the only contributing column is \u03b1, and in column \u03b1 there is exactly one point above \u03b2 (the other one), so T_3(\u03b2)=1. Hence (3,\u03b2) is unique.\n  \u2013 Subcase 2c: If no row has 2 points, then no column has 2 points (by the assumption of this case), so all four points lie in distinct rows and columns, i.e., U is an antichain. By Lemma A, a unique type\u20132 color exists.\n  This exhausts all possibilities. \u220e\n  Why useful: Extends the curated base case |U|=3 to |U|=4 with a complete, verifiable proof. Such small n verifications often guide invariant selection for inductive or structural proofs in the general case.\n\n### Examples/tests of the new lemmas\n- Example for Lemma K. U={ (4,7),(7,7),(1,1) }. Here m=(7,7), \u03b1\u2082=4, and column 4 has no other points. The edge (4,7)-(7,7) has color (4,4), unique.\n- Example for Lemma H\u2032. U={ (2,2),(3,5),(5,5) }. Here m=(5,5), T={3}, \u03b1\u2082=3, R=\u2205, \u03b2\u2082=\u2212\u221e. S contains p=(2,2), which is Max(S) and satisfies p_x=2<3 (fails \u03b1-threshold), so H\u2032 does not fire. However Lemma K applies: (3,5)-(5,5) yields unique (4,3).\n- Example for P4 Subcase 2b. U={ (1,1),(3,1),(1,4),(4,4) }. Two rows have pairs with common left x=1; column 1 has points at y=1,4, so (3,1) is unique type\u20133.\n\n### Ideas toward the remaining unique\u2013maximal subcase\n- If S\u2260\u2205 and every p\u2208Max(S) fails at least one threshold (p_x<\u03b1\u2082 or p_y<\u03b2\u2082), then informally the set of SW-maxima sits entirely \u201cleft of \u03b1\u2082\u201d or \u201cbelow \u03b2\u2082\u201d. This suggests that either many top-row points (besides \u03b1\u2082) exist or many right-column points (besides \u03b2\u2082) exist. A plausible next step is a counting/ordering lemma: if all SW-maxima lie left of \u03b1\u2082, then the column \u03b1\u2082 must reappear below Y; combining with the non-firing of Lemma K, this forces a row \u03b2 where (\u03b1\u2082,\u03b2) has \u22652 distinct right neighbors, which then interacts with the right column to produce a singleton+extension trigger (Lemma E/F) on some carefully chosen row/column. I will formalize this as a \u201cpivot-or-corner\u201d dichotomy next.\n\n### Multiple maxima: sharpening the type\u20132 \u201cclean gap\u201d tool\n- Recall Lemma D: for consecutive maxima m_i=(x_i,y_i), m_{i+1}=(x_{i+1},y_{i+1}), if R_i=S_i=1 then (2,x_i,y_{i+1}) is unique. I plan to strengthen it to a local rectangle lemma that tolerates extra points provided they do not enter the open rectangle (x_i,x_{i+1})\u00d7(y_{i+1},y_i) nor attach to its two \u201cL-corner\u201d rays simultaneously. A sketch statement:\n  \u2022 Lemma D\u2032 (robust L-corner). If among points of column x_i above y_{i+1} only y_i occurs (no (x_i,y) with y_{i+1}<y<y_i), and among points of row y_{i+1} to the right of x_i only x_{i+1} occurs (no (x,y_{i+1}) with x_i<x<x_{i+1}), then (2,x_i,y_{i+1}) is unique, regardless of points outside the L-corner. This generalizes Lemma G and follows immediately from the type\u20132 formula. I will formalize and add to output once verified.\n  Why useful: It expands the catalog of local patterns that directly certify a unique type\u20132 color in G[U] without global sparsity assumptions.\n\n### Obstacles\n- The outstanding piece is the unique\u2013maximal case when neither boundary pivot (K/K\u2032) triggers and all SW-maxima fail one of the thresholds in Lemma H\u2032. The structure strongly suggests a \u201cboundary richness\u201d that should force a singleton+extension somewhere (Lemmas E/F) or a robust L-corner (Lemma D\u2032), but I do not yet have a complete implication.\n- For |Max(U)|\u22652, it remains to be shown that a global failure of all D/D\u2032 triggers (for all consecutive maxima) forces a type\u20131 witness (unique NE neighbor) or a type\u20133/4 trigger; I plan to attempt a layering-by-minimals argument with carefully defined \u201cforbidden rectangles.\u201d\n\n### Next steps (concrete and auditable)\n1) Formalize and prove Lemma D\u2032 (robust L-corner uniqueness) and curate it. Validate on configurations with populated outer strips but empty corner rectangles.\n2) Complete the unique\u2013maximal case using the trichotomy: H\u2032 or K or K\u2032 must fire. The intended proof is a contradiction: assume none fires; show that either a singleton+extension (E/F) appears on some row/column or a D\u2032 L-corner emerges between the two rightmost top-row columns or two highest right-column rows.\n3) Extend small-case verification to |U|=5 via a structured case split (using P4 and the new triggers) to further stress-test the dichotomies and refine the minimality invariants.\n"
