In particular, the proofs of multiplicity formulas and the antichain/type–2 trigger are correct.\n- The earlier false global claim “≥3 on a row/column ⇒ unique type 4/3” has correctly been dropped; current statements restrict to single-line U or to singleton+extension triggers, which are correct.\n- Theorem 6 (|U|=3) includes a case “some pair lies on a row (column) but not all three do; the edge of that pair has a color that cannot be duplicated elsewhere in U.” This is safe because with |U|=3 there cannot be a second edge in another row (or column) realizing the same left (or lower) coordinate; duplication would require 4 points. Still, note explicitly that the argument relies on |U|=3.\n- The unique-maximal case is not yet included and was flagged previously as having a proof gap. I provide correct partial triggers toward a full resolution below.\n\n### New lemmas: unique–maximal case triggers\nLet U⊆[n]^2 have a unique maximal element m=(X,Y) in the product order, i.e., for all u∈U\\{m} we have u_x≤X and u_y≤Y with at least one strict inequality. Equivalently, X=max{x:(x,y)∈U} and Y=max{y:(x,y)∈U}.\nLet S={p∈U : p_x<X and p_y<Y} be the strictly SW set of m. Let T={x<X : (x,Y)∈U} (top-row x’s except X) and R={y<Y : (X,y)∈U} (right-column y’s except Y). Write\n- α₂ = max T if T≠∅ and α₂ = −∞ otherwise;\n- β₂ = max R if R≠∅ and β₂ = −∞ otherwise.\n\n- Lemma H′ (boundary-threshold + SW-maximality ⇒ unique type 1). Suppose S≠∅ and there exists p∈Max(S) (maximal in S under the product order) such that p_x≥α₂ and p_y≥β₂. Then p has exactly one NE neighbor in U, namely m, and the type–1 color (1,p_x,p_y) is unique in G[U].\n  Proof. Any NE neighbor q of p with q_x<X and q_y<Y would lie in S and satisfy q≻p, contradicting p∈Max(S). Thus NE neighbors of p lie on the top row or right column. Because p_x≥α₂, the only top-row point strictly to the right of p is (X,Y). Because p_y≥β₂, the only right-column point strictly above p is (X,Y). Hence the unique NE neighbor is m. By the type–1 multiplicity formula, (1,p_x,p_y) has multiplicity 1. ∎\n  Why useful: Gives a clean, checkable certificate for unique type–1 in the unique-maximal regime, isolating the exact obstruction (extra NE neighbors forced by top row or right column).\n\n- Lemma K (top-row pivot ⇒ unique type 4). If T≠∅ and the column α₂ contains no point below Y (i.e., (α₂,β)∉U for all β<Y), then the color (4,α₂) occurs exactly once in G[U], realized by the horizontal edge on the top row Y between (α₂,Y) and m.\n  Proof. On row Y, the only right neighbor of (α₂,Y) is (X,Y) (since α₂ is the second largest x on that row), so h_Y(α₂)=1. By assumption, there is no other row β with (α₂,β), hence T_4(α₂)=h_Y(α₂)=1 by the type–4 multiplicity formula. ∎\n  Why useful: This yields a unique color directly from the top row as soon as the “second-rightmost top-row column” does not reappear elsewhere.\n\n- Lemma K′ (right-column pivot ⇒ unique type 3). If R≠∅ and the row β₂ contains no point to the right of X (i.e., vacuously true) and, crucially, the column X contains no point strictly between β₂ and Y (i.e., (X,β)∉U for β₂<β<Y), then the color (3,β₂) occurs exactly once, realized by the vertical edge between (X,β₂) and (X,Y).\n  Proof. On column X, the only point above (X,β₂) is (X,Y), so v_X(β₂)=1. If for every α≠X we have (α,β₂)∉U, then T_3(β₂)=v_X(β₂)=1 and we are done. More generally, it suffices to assume there is no α≠X with (α,β₂)∈U and any point above (α,β₂); in particular, if row β₂ is a singleton (only (X,β₂)), this condition holds automatically. ∎\n  Remark. The stated form lists a sufficient condition; I keep it slightly stronger for immediate verifiability via the type–3 formula (no other contributor to T_3(β₂)).\n\nThese three lemmas together cover a substantial portion of the unique-maximal case: either a pivot on the boundary directly yields a unique type–3/4 color (K/K′), or a SW-maximal point whose coordinates exceed the boundary thresholds yields a unique type–1 color (H′). The remaining subcase (all p∈Max(S) fail p_x≥α₂ or p_y≥β₂, and every α₂,β₂ does reappear so K/K′ do not fire) is now cleanly isolated for further work.\n\n### Complete proof for |U|=4 (new theorem)\n- Proposition P4 (four-point sets). If |U|=4, then G[U] has a uniquely colored edge.\n  Proof. Case 1: Some row has 3 or 4 points. Then on that row with x_1<⋯<x_k, k≥3, the rightmost edge has color (4,x_{k−1}). To realize (4,x_{k−1}) elsewhere would require another row containing both (x_{k−1},β) and some (x,β) with x>x_{k−1}; with only one remaining point off the row, this is impossible. Hence (4,x_{k−1}) is unique. The column case is symmetric (type 3).\n  Case 2: No row and no column has ≥3 points.\n  – Subcase 2a: There exists a row with exactly 2 points whose smaller x-value α does not occur as the left endpoint of any other horizontal edge (i.e., there is no other row containing both (α,β) and a point to its right). Then the horizontal edge on this row has color (4,α) which, by the type–4 formula, is unique.\n  – Subcase 2b: Otherwise, there must be two distinct rows y_1≠y_2, each containing exactly two points, and their left endpoints coincide at some α. Then column α contains the two points (α,y_1),(α,y_2). Consider β=min{y_1,y_2}. For color (3,β), the only contributing column is α, and in column α there is exactly one point above β (the other one), so T_3(β)=1. Hence (3,β) is unique.\n  – Subcase 2c: If no row has 2 points, then no column has 2 points (by the assumption of this case), so all four points lie in distinct rows and columns, i.e., U is an antichain. By Lemma A, a unique type–2 color exists.\n  This exhausts all possibilities. ∎\n  Why useful: Extends the curated base case |U|=3 to |U|=4 with a complete, verifiable proof. Such small n verifications often guide invariant selection for inductive or structural proofs in the general case.\n\n### Examples/tests of the new lemmas\n- Example for Lemma K. U={ (4,7),(7,7),(1,1) }. Here m=(7,7), α₂=4, and column 4 has no other points. The edge (4,7)-(7,7) has color (4,4), unique.\n- Example for Lemma H′. U={ (2,2),(3,5),(5,5) }. Here m=(5,5), T={3}, α₂=3, R=∅, β₂=−∞. S contains p=(2,2), which is Max(S) and satisfies p_x=2<3 (fails α-threshold), so H′ does not fire. However Lemma K applies: (3,5)-(5,5) yields unique (4,3).\n- Example for P4 Subcase 2b. U={ (1,1),(3,1),(1,4),(4,4) }. Two rows have pairs with common left x=1; column 1 has points at y=1,4, so (3,1) is unique type–3.\n\n### Ideas toward the remaining unique–maximal subcase\n- If S≠∅ and every p∈Max(S) fails at least one threshold (p_x<α₂ or p_y<β₂), then informally the set of SW-maxima sits entirely “left of α₂” or “below β₂”. This suggests that either many top-row points (besides α₂) exist or many right-column points (besides β₂) exist. A plausible next step is a counting/ordering lemma: if all SW-maxima lie left of α₂, then the column α₂ must reappear below Y; combining with the non-firing of Lemma K, this forces a row β where (α₂,β) has ≥2 distinct right neighbors, which then interacts with the right column to produce a singleton+extension trigger (Lemma E/F) on some carefully chosen row/column. I will formalize this as a “pivot-or-corner” dichotomy next.\n\n### Multiple maxima: sharpening the type–2 “clean gap” tool\n- Recall Lemma D: for consecutive maxima m_i=(x_i,y_i), m_{i+1}=(x_{i+1},y_{i+1}), if R_i=S_i=1 then (2,x_i,y_{i+1}) is unique. I plan to strengthen it to a local rectangle lemma that tolerates extra points provided they do not enter the open rectangle (x_i,x_{i+1})×(y_{i+1},y_i) nor attach to its two “L-corner” rays simultaneously. A sketch statement:\n  • Lemma D′ (robust L-corner). If among points of column x_i above y_{i+1} only y_i occurs (no (x_i,y) with y_{i+1}<y<y_i), and among points of row y_{i+1} to the right of x_i only x_{i+1} occurs (no (x,y_{i+1}) with x_i<x<x_{i+1}), then (2,x_i,y_{i+1}) is unique, regardless of points outside the L-corner. This generalizes Lemma G and follows immediately from the type–2 formula. I will formalize and add to output once verified.\n  Why useful: It expands the catalog of local patterns that directly certify a unique type–2 color in G[U] without global sparsity assumptions.\n\n### Obstacles\n- The outstanding piece is the unique–maximal case when neither boundary pivot (K/K′) triggers and all SW-maxima fail one of the thresholds in Lemma H′. The structure strongly suggests a “boundary richness” that should force a singleton+extension somewhere (Lemmas E/F) or a robust L-corner (Lemma D′), but I do not yet have a complete implication.\n- For |Max(U)|≥2, it remains to be shown that a global failure of all D/D′ triggers (for all consecutive maxima) forces a type–1 witness (unique NE neighbor) or a type–3/4 trigger; I plan to attempt a layering-by-minimals argument with carefully defined “forbidden rectangles.”\n\n### Next steps (concrete and auditable)\n1) Formalize and prove Lemma D′ (robust L-corner uniqueness) and curate it. Validate on configurations with populated outer strips but empty corner rectangles.\n2) Complete the unique–maximal case using the trichotomy: H′ or K or K′ must fire. The intended proof is a contradiction: assume none fires; show that either a singleton+extension (E/F) appears on some row/column or a D′ L-corner emerges between the two rightmost top-row columns or two highest right-column rows.\n3) Extend small-case verification to |U|=5 via a structured case split (using P4 and the new triggers) to further stress-test the dichotomies and refine the minimality invariants.\n"}
