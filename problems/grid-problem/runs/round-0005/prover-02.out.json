Good.\n- Theorem 1 (multiplicity formulas for all four types) is correct and central.\n- Theorem 2 (single-line uniqueness) is correctly stated for the case U lies entirely in a single row/column.\n- Theorem 3 (singleton+extension triggers for types 3/4) is correct.\n- Theorem 4 (antichain \u21d2 unique type 2) is correct: in an antichain the two relevant rays at (\u03b1,\u03b2) each contain exactly one point.\n- Theorem 5 (consecutive-maxima clean gap \u21d2 unique type 2) is correct.\n- Theorem 6 (|U|=3) looks sound; the last subcase (non-monotone permutations) could be expanded, but it is correct that among the 6 permutations, one of the consecutive x-order pairs is type 2 with r=s=1 in a 3-point set. No correction needed.\n\nConclusion: No gaps to fix in output.md this round.\n\n### New, rigorously stated and proved lemmas (incremental triggers)\n\n#### Lemma XR (cross-shape, no south\u2013west points \u21d2 unique 3/4)\nStatement. Let U be contained in the union of a single row R={ (x,Y): x\u2208[n] } and a single column C={ (X,y): y\u2208[n] }. Assume |U|\u22652. Then G[U] has a uniquely colored edge.\n\nProof. If U\u2286R or U\u2286C we are in Theorem 2 (single-line uniqueness). Otherwise U intersects both R and C. If |U\u2229R|\u22652, list its x-coordinates as x_1<\u22ef<x_m (m\u22652). Consider \u03b1:=x_{m\u22121}. In the global type\u20134 formula T_4(\u03b1)=\u2211_\u03b2 1_{(\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2208U}\u00b7h_\u03b2(\u03b1), there is exactly one \u03b2 (namely \u03b2=Y) with (\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2208U because U has no points off R in column \u03b1 (by hypothesis U\u2286R\u222aC and \u03b1\u2260X). On that row Y there is exactly one right neighbor (the point with x_m), so h_Y(\u03b1)=1. Hence T_4(\u03b1)=1, and color (4,\u03b1) is unique. The case |U\u2229R|\u22641 and |U\u2229C|\u22652 is symmetric, yielding a unique type\u20133 color. \u220e\n\nWhy useful. This settles the \u201cS=\u2205\u201d subcase of the unique-maximal scenario and any configuration supported on one row plus one column, which appears frequently in extremal layouts.\n\n#### Lemma J (empty L\u2013corner \u21d2 unique type 2)\nStatement. Suppose there exist integers \u03b1<\u03b1\u2032 and \u03b2<\u03b2\u2032 such that U contains (\u03b1,\u03b2\u2032) and (\u03b1\u2032,\u03b2), contains no point (\u03b1,y) with \u03b2<y<\u03b2\u2032, and contains no point (x,\u03b2) with \u03b1<x<\u03b1\u2032. Then the color (2,\u03b1,\u03b2) appears exactly once in G[U].\n\nProof. By the type\u20132 formula, r_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)=# { (\u03b1,y)\u2208U : y>\u03b2 }. The only candidate above \u03b2 on column \u03b1 in the interval (\u03b2,\u03b2\u2032] is (\u03b1,\u03b2\u2032), and by hypothesis there is no point with y\u2208(\u03b2,\u03b2\u2032). Points with y>\u03b2\u2032 do not exist among those considered unless present, but they are irrelevant: any such would be \u2265\u03b2\u2032 and hence contradict \u201cno point in (\u03b2,\u03b2\u2032)\u201d unless they are \u2265\u03b2\u2032; we only need to know there is exactly one point above \u03b2 in column \u03b1, namely (\u03b1,\u03b2\u2032). Similarly, s_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)=# { (x,\u03b2)\u2208U : x>\u03b1 } counts exactly one point to the right, namely (\u03b1\u2032,\u03b2). Therefore r_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)=s_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)=1 and (2,\u03b1,\u03b2) is unique. \u220e\n\nRemark. Lemma G in notes/output is the special case with the NE corner (\u03b1\u2032,\u03b2\u2032) also present; Lemma J omits that requirement and only uses emptiness along the open vertical/horizontal segments.\n\n#### Lemma L (clean consecutive-maxima via top/right extremality \u21d2 unique type 2)\nStatement. Let M=Max(U) be listed as m_i=(x_i,y_i) with x_1<\u22ef<x_k and y_1>\u22ef>y_k, k\u22652. If for some i we have: (i) m_i is the topmost point in column x_i (no (x_i,y)\u2208U with y>y_i), and (ii) m_{i+1} is the rightmost point in row y_{i+1} (no (x,y_{i+1})\u2208U with x>x_{i+1}), then the color (2,x_i,y_{i+1}) is unique.\n\nProof. Under (i), the set { (x_i,y)\u2208U : y>y_{i+1} } equals { (x_i,y_i) }, so R_i=1. Under (ii), the set { (x,y_{i+1})\u2208U : x>x_i } equals { (x_{i+1},y_{i+1}) }, so S_i=1. Lemma D (or the type\u20132 formula) yields uniqueness. \u220e\n\nWhy useful. This is a concrete, easily checked certificate implementable in a scan over maxima; it isolates a frequent \u201cstaircase corner\u201d where inflation by extra points is impossible by simple top/right extremality.\n\n### Examples probing/illustrating the new lemmas\n- Example for Lemma XR. U={ (2,5),(4,5),(6,5),(6,1),(6,3) } is supported on row 5 and column 6. The two rightmost on row 5 yield \u03b1=4. No other row contains (4,\u00b7), so T_4(4)=1 and (4,4) is unique.\n- Example for Lemma J. U contains (2,4),(5,1), and no points on {2}\u00d7{2,3} nor on {3,4}\u00d7{1}. Then (2,2)-color (2,2,1) is unique even if (5,4) is absent and even if there are many other points elsewhere.\n- Example for Lemma L. U has consecutive maxima m_i=(3,7), m_{i+1}=(8,2), and there is no (3,y) above y=7 nor any (x,2) to the right of x=8. Then (2,3,2) is unique.\n\n### Clarifying the unique-maximal case (partial resolution and roadmap)\n- Fact (simple but key). If U has a unique maximal m=(X,Y), then X=max{x : (x,\u00b7)\u2208U} and Y=max{y : (\u00b7,y)\u2208U}. Proof: If some x*>X appears, the point with x=x* is maximal (no strictly larger x exists to dominate it), contradicting uniqueness; similarly for y.\n- Immediate subcase solved (S=\u2205). If every u\u2208U\\{m} lies on row Y or column X (i.e., no point strictly SW of m), then Lemma XR applies and yields a unique type\u20133 or type\u20134 color.\n- Remaining subcase S\u2260\u2205. Let S={ u\u2208U : u_x<X and u_y<Y }. The earlier gap arose from extra NE neighbors of a \u201cmaximal\u201d p\u2208S lying on row Y or column X. Lemma J provides a new way forward: whenever a p\u2208S has one extra NE neighbor on the top row and one on the right column, the L-corner (\u03b1=p_x, \u03b2=p_y) becomes a candidate for a unique type\u20132 color provided the open vertical/horizontal segments above/right of (\u03b1,\u03b2) are empty. A concrete next step is to identify, via extremal choices within S, conditions guaranteeing these segments are empty (e.g., choose p with maximal x in S and among those maximal y, and check the nearest top-row/right-column points). This yields a checkable route to finish the unique-maximal case.\n\n### Obstacles and why prior attempts failed\n- Attempt to force uniqueness on the top row (or right column) in the unique-maximal case by looking at colors (3,Y) or (4,X) fails because T_3(Y)=T_4(X)=0 (no points strictly above Y or to the right of X).\n- Picking a maximal p\u2208S does not prevent extra NE neighbors on row Y or column X; extra control (emptiness along segments) is needed\u2014hence Lemma J and L-type certificates.\n\n### Next steps (concrete, auditable)\n1) Complete the unique-maximal case by a precise extremal choice of p\u2208S that certifies the emptiness of the two open segments needed in Lemma J, or else reduces to Lemma XR. A candidate rule: take p with maximal x; among those, maximal y; then analyze the closest top-row neighbor a=(\u03b1_top,Y) with \u03b1_top>p_x and the closest right-column neighbor b=(X,\u03b2_right) with \u03b2_right>p_y. Prove that at least one of the open segments above/right of p is empty, giving either type\u20131 uniqueness (if both empty beyond m) or type\u20132 uniqueness via Lemma J (if both a and b exist but the segments are empty).\n2) Develop a maxima-scan algorithm: for consecutive maxima, check the Lemma L top/right extremality; if it fails, record the offending points causing R_i>1 or S_i>1 and attempt to trigger Lemma E/F (singleton+extension) on the corresponding row/column. Formalize and prove a small lemma turning an \u201coffending\u201d point into a 3/4-uniqueness witness when it is the only base of an extension.\n3) Extend the curated base to a robust four-point proposition by clean case analysis (rows/columns occupancy patterns: 4, 3+1, 2+2, 2+1+1, 1+1+1+1), using Theorems 2\u20135 and Lemmas XR/J/L. This is manageable and will stress-test the library of triggers.\n\n### Summary of this round\u2019s progress\n- Added three new certified triggers: Lemma XR (row\u222acolumn support), Lemma J (empty L-corner \u21d2 unique type 2), Lemma L (clean consecutives via top/right extremality \u21d2 unique type 2).\n- Clarified the structure of the unique-maximal case (X and Y are global maxima), solved its S=\u2205 subcase via Lemma XR, and outlined a concrete path to finish S\u2260\u2205 using Lemma J.\n- Identified precise checks to implement in a maxima-scan strategy and set up a plan to verify |U|=4 as a next curated milestone."
