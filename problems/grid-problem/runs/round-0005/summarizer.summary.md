Round 0005 added several localized, verifiable triggers and closed small-case gaps while isolating a single remaining hard subcase. Prover-01 introduced unique-maximal case lemmas H' (boundary-threshold ⇒ unique type–1) and K/K' (top-row/right-column pivots ⇒ unique types 4/3) and gave a complete |U|=4 proof (Proposition P4). Prover-02 added complementary triggers XR (support ⊆ one row ∪ one column ⇒ unique 3/4), J (empty L–corner ⇒ unique type–2), and L (top/right extremality on consecutive maxima ⇒ unique type–2), and showed S=∅ (no strictly SW points of the unique maximum) is handled by XR. Both audits removed the earlier false global claim about “≥3 on a row/column ⇒ unique 4/3.” The remaining isolated obstacle is the unique-maximal subcase where every SW-maximal point fails the H' thresholds and α₂,β₂ reappear so K/K' don't fire; the plan is to finish it by formalizing a robust L-corner (D') and a pivot-or-corner dichotomy and to stress-test with |U|=5.
