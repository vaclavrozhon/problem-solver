  "feedback_md": "Overall, both reports contain good ideas and some clean, checkable additions, but they also include a few statements whose hypotheses are too weak. I flag the specific issues and give fixes, plus concrete next steps.\n\nProver 01\n- Lemma H\u2032 (unique-maximal + boundary thresholds \u21d2 unique type 1) is correct as stated. The reasoning that any NE neighbor of p off the boundary would contradict p \u2208 Max(S), and that the boundary thresholds p_x \u2265 \u03b1\u2082 and p_y \u2265 \u03b2\u2082 isolate m as the only NE neighbor, is sound. This is a valuable trigger in the unique-maximal regime.\n- Lemma K (top-row pivot \u21d2 unique type 4) is also correct; it is a clean application of the type-4 multiplicity formula when \u03b1\u2082\u2019s column does not reappear below the top row.\n- Lemma K\u2032 as written is too weak to conclude uniqueness of (3,\u03b2\u2082). Your proof uses an extra condition (\u201cno other contributors to T_3(\u03b2\u2082)\u201d), but the formal statement does not impose it. Counterexample: U = {(5,5),(5,2),(1,2),(1,4)} has R \u2260 \u2205 and no (5,3),(5,4), yet T_3(2)=v_5(2)+v_1(2)=1+1=2, so (3,2) is not unique. A corrected safe form is: if row \u03b2\u2082 is a singleton (only (X,\u03b2\u2082)) and column X has exactly one point above \u03b2\u2082, then (3,\u03b2\u2082) is unique (this is an instance of the singleton+extension trigger).\n- Proposition P4 (|U|=4 \u21d2 a unique color): the idea and many subcases are right, but Subcase 2c (\u201cIf no row has 2 points, then no column has 2 points\u201d) is false. Counterexample: U = {(1,1),(1,3),(2,2),(2,4)}. Nonetheless, P4 is true; it just needs a revised case split that also handles the dual column patterns. I supply a corrected proof in output.md.\n- Your planned Lemma D\u2032 (robust L-corner) is correct and immediate from the type-2 formula; I\u2019ve formalized and added it to output.md.\n\nProver 02\n- Lemma XR (row \u222a column support \u21d2 a unique 3/4 color) is correct and useful. It cleanly settles the unique-maximal subcase S=\u2205 and more generally any \u201ccross-shaped\u201d support.\n- Lemma J (empty L-corner \u21d2 unique type 2) as stated is false: forbidding points only in the open segments (\u03b2,\u03b2\u2032) and (\u03b1,\u03b1\u2032) is insufficient. Counterexample: with (\u03b1,\u03b2\u2032)=(1,2) and (\u03b1\u2032,\u03b2)=(3,1), add (1,5) and (5,1). Then r_U(1,1)=2 and s_U(1,1)=2, so the color (2,1,1) has multiplicity 4. The correct sufficient condition is exactly that r_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)=s_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)=1, i.e., no other points above (\u03b1,\u03b2) in its column and no other points to the right on its row beyond the one specified neighbor.\n- Lemma L (maxima corner via \u201ctopmost/rightmost\u201d) is too weak: \u201cm_i topmost in column x_i\u201d does not prevent extra points with y_{i+1}<y<y_i in that column, so R_i can exceed 1. Counterexample: U = {(2,5),(5,2),(2,4)}; m_i=(2,5), m_{i+1}=(5,2) are consecutive maxima, m_i is topmost in column 2, m_{i+1} is rightmost in row 2, yet r_U(2,2)=2 and the color (2,2,2) is not unique. I\u2019ve added a robust version (our Lemma D\u2032) that explicitly requires R_i=S_i=1.\n- Your \u201cFact\u201d about unique maximal implies X, Y are global maxima is correct and helpful. The S=\u2205 subcase is now fully covered by Lemma XR.\n\nWhat I curated into output.md this round\n- Robust L-corner uniqueness (type 2) as a general trigger (formal, with proof).\n- Cross-shape (row \u222a column) uniqueness.\n- Unique-maximal triggers: H\u2032 (SW-max + thresholds \u21d2 unique type 1) and the top-row pivot K (\u21d2 unique type 4).\n- A corrected, complete proof that every 4-point set admits a uniquely colored edge.\n\nNext steps (precise and auditable)\n1) Unique-maximal case completion: Prove a trichotomy that for a unique maximal m, at least one of H\u2032, K, or the column-dual of K (in its safe, singleton+extension form) fires, or else a robust L-corner (D\u2032) occurs for a carefully chosen p \u2208 Max(S). Suggested choice: pick p \u2208 Max(S) with maximal x, and among those maximal y. Let a=(\u03b1_top,Y) be the nearest top-row point with \u03b1_top>p_x (if any) and b=(X,\u03b2_right) the nearest right-column point with \u03b2_right>p_y (if any). Show: either a or b is absent (triggering H\u2032), or one of the open segments above/right of p is empty (trigger D\u2032), or \u03b1_top (resp. \u03b2_right) is a singleton base (trigger K or its safe column-dual).\n2) Maxima-scan strengthening: For consecutive maxima, formalize and use D\u2032 as the robust certificate; when D\u2032 fails, identify the specific \u201coffending\u201d points that inflate R_i or S_i and try to convert them into a singleton+extension on their row/column.\n3) Stress-test on |U|=5: classify by row/column occupancy, invoke Theorems 2\u20136 and the new triggers to produce a clean proof, or extract the minimum unresolved subpattern as a target for a new lemma.\n",
  "new_notes_md": "New curated results and corrections (this round)\n\n1) Robust L-corner uniqueness (type 2)\nIf there exist \u03b1<\u03b1\u2032 and \u03b2<\u03b2\u2032 with (\u03b1,\u03b2\u2032),(\u03b1\u2032,\u03b2)\u2208U and, moreover, (i) (\u03b1,\u03b2) has exactly one point above it in its column (namely (\u03b1,\u03b2\u2032)) and (ii) exactly one point to its right in its row (namely (\u03b1\u2032,\u03b2)), then by the type-2 multiplicity formula r_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)=s_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)=1 and so the color (2,\u03b1,\u03b2) is unique. This generalizes the previously noted \u201c2\u00d72 rectangle with clean margins\u201d by not requiring the NE corner (\u03b1\u2032,\u03b2\u2032) to be present.\n\n2) Cross-shape (row \u222a column) support \u21d2 unique color\nIf U is contained in the union of a single row Y and a single column X and |U|\u22652, then G[U] has a uniquely colored edge. Proof: if |U\u2229row Y|\u22652, let \u03b1 be the second-largest x on that row. Since \u03b1\u2260X, the only row containing (\u03b1,\u00b7) inside U is Y, and on that row h_Y(\u03b1)=1. Thus T_4(\u03b1)=1 (unique type 4). Otherwise |U\u2229column X|\u22652 and the vertical analogue gives a unique type 3.\n\n3) Unique-maximal triggers\nLet U have a unique maximal m=(X,Y) in the product order. Then X and Y are the global maxima of the used x- and y-coordinates. Define T={x<X : (x,Y)\u2208U} with \u03b1\u2082=max T (if T\u2260\u2205) and R={y<Y : (X,y)\u2208U} with \u03b2\u2082=max R (if R\u2260\u2205).

If S\u2260\u2205 and there exists p\u2208Max(S) with p_x\u2265\u03b1\u2082 and p_y\u2265\u03b2\u2082, then p has exactly one NE neighbor in U (namely m), hence the color (1,p_x,p_y) is unique.\n- K (top-row pivot \u21d2 unique type 4). If T\u2260\u2205 and the column \u03b1\u2082 contains no point below Y, then T_4(\u03b1\u2082)=1, realized by the top-row edge between (\u03b1\u2082,Y) and m.\nRemark: The column-dual must be formulated with care (see below) to avoid extra contributors in T_3(\u03b2\u2082).\n\nCorrections to proposed lemmas\n- The proposed Lemma J (empty L-corner \u21d2 unique type 2) was too weak: forbidding points only in the open segments (\u03b2,\u03b2\u2032) and (\u03b1,\u03b1\u2032) does not preclude additional points above \u03b2\u2032 or to the right of \u03b1\u2032. A correct sufficient condition is exactly r_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)=s_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)=1 (see robust L-corner above). Counterexample to the weak form: U={(1,2),(3,1),(1,5),(5,1)} satisfies the stated emptiness on (1, y\u2208(1,2)) and (x\u2208(1,3),1) but yields multiplicity 4 for color (2,1,1).\n- The proposed Lemma K\u2032 (right-column pivot \u21d2 unique type 3) as stated omitted the requirement that no other columns contribute to T_3(\u03b2\u2082). A safe version is the singleton+extension trigger: if row \u03b2\u2082 is a singleton (only (X,\u03b2\u2082)) and column X has exactly one point above \u03b2\u2082 (necessarily m in the unique-maximal regime), then T_3(\u03b2\u2082)=1. Counterexample to the weak form: U={(5,5),(5,2),(1,2),(1,4)} makes T_3(2)=2.\n- The proposed Lemma L (top/right extremality of consecutive maxima \u21d2 unique type 2) is false without excluding intermediate points in column x_i above y_{i+1} (or in row y_{i+1} to the right of x_i). Counterexample: U={(2,5),(5,2),(2,4)} satisfies \u201cm_i topmost\u201d and \u201cm_{i+1} rightmost,\u201d yet r_U(2,2)=2.\n\nFour-point sets (|U|=4)\nThe claim that every 4-point configuration admits a uniquely colored edge is true; a corrected complete proof is added to output.md. The flawed claim \u201cif no row has 2 points, then no column has 2 points\u201d is refuted by U={(1,1),(1,3),(2,2),(2,4)}. The corrected proof handles all row/column occupancy patterns (4), (3+1), (2+2), (2+1+1), and (1+1+1+1), using type-3/4 triggers or the antichain lemma.\n\nRoadmap for the unique-maximal case\n- S=\u2205 is settled by the cross-shape lemma.\n- For S\u2260\u2205, aim for a trichotomy: H\u2032 or K (or the safe column-dual) or a robust L-corner (D\u2032) must fire. A workable extremal choice is p\u2208Max(S) with maximal x and, among those, maximal y; analyze its nearest boundary neighbors and the emptiness of the two open segments above/right of p. If both segments are populated, try to extract a singleton+extension on the boundary or an L-corner between consecutive top-row/right-column supports.\n",

  "new_outputs_md": "Theorem 7 (Robust L-corner uniqueness for type 2).\nLet \u03b1<\u03b1\u2032 and \u03b2<\u03b2\u2032. Suppose (\u03b1,\u03b2\u2032),(\u03b1\u2032,\u03b2)\u2208U, and in column \u03b1 there is exactly one point above \u03b2 (namely (\u03b1,\u03b2\u2032)), and in row \u03b2 there is exactly one point to the right of \u03b1 (namely (\u03b1\u2032,\u03b2)). Then the color (2,\u03b1,\u03b2) occurs exactly once in G[U].\nProof. By Theorem 1 (type 2), r_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)=1 and s_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)=1, hence the multiplicity r_U\u00b7s_U=1.\n\nTheorem 8 (Row \u222a column support \u21d2 a unique color).\nAssume U\u2286({x=X}\u00d7[n]) \u222a ([n]\u00d7{y=Y}) and |U|\u22652. Then G[U] has a uniquely colored edge.\nProof. If U\u2286{x=X}\u00d7[n] or U\u2286[n]\u00d7{y=Y}, Theorem 2 applies. Otherwise U meets both the row and the column. If |U\u2229([n]\u00d7{Y})|\u22652, list its x-coordinates x_1<\u22ef<x_m and set \u03b1=x_{m\u22121}. Since \u03b1\u2260X and U\u2286(column X)\u222a(row Y), the only \u03b2 with (\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2208U is \u03b2=Y. On row Y, h_Y(\u03b1)=1. Hence T_4(\u03b1)=1 by Theorem 1 (type 4). If instead |U\u2229({X}\u00d7[n])|\u22652, the vertical analogue yields a unique type-3 color.\n\nTheorem 9 (Unique-maximal: SW-max with boundary thresholds \u21d2 unique type 1).\nSuppose U has a unique maximal element m=(X,Y) in the product order. Let T={x<X : (x,Y)\u2208U} and R={y<Y : (X,y)\u2208U}, with \u03b1\u2082=max T if T\u2260\u2205 (and \u03b1\u2082=\u2212\u221e otherwise), and \u03b2\u2082=max R if R\u2260\u2205 (and \u03b2\u2082=\u2212\u221e otherwise). Let S={p\u2208U : p_x<X and p_y<Y}. If S\u2260\u2205 and there exists p\u2208Max(S) (for the product order) with p_x\u2265\u03b1\u2082 and p_y\u2265\u03b2\u2082, then the color (1,p_x,p_y) is unique.\nProof. Any NE neighbor q of p with q_x<X and q_y<Y would satisfy q\u227bp and lie in S, contradicting p\u2208Max(S). Thus every NE neighbor of p lies on row Y or column X. Because p_x\u2265\u03b1\u2082, there is no (x,Y)\u2208U with p_x<x<X, and because p_y\u2265\u03b2\u2082, there is no (X,y)\u2208U with p_y<y<Y. Hence the only possible NE neighbor is m. By Theorem 1 (type 1), the multiplicity of (1,p_x,p_y) equals the number of NE neighbors of p, namely 1.\n\nTheorem 10 (Unique-maximal: top-row pivot \u21d2 unique type 4).\nIn the setting of Theorem 9, if T\u2260\u2205 and the column \u03b1\u2082 contains no point below Y, then the color (4,\u03b1\u2082) occurs exactly once in G[U].\nProof. On row Y, the point (\u03b1\u2082,Y) has exactly one right neighbor, (X,Y), so h_Y(\u03b1\u2082)=1. For \u03b2\u2260Y there is no (\u03b1\u2082,\u03b2)\u2208U by hypothesis, and there are no \u03b2>Y in U when m is the unique maximal. Therefore T_4(\u03b1\u2082)=h_Y(\u03b1\u2082)=1 by Theorem 1 (type 4).\n\nTheorem 11 (Every four-point set admits a uniquely colored edge).\nIf |U|=4, then G[U] has a uniquely colored edge.\nProof. If some row has \u22653 points, list the x-coordinates on that row as x_1<\u22ef<x_k with k\u22653. The rightmost edge on that row has color (4,x_{k\u22121}). To realize (4,x_{k\u22121}) elsewhere would require a different row containing both (x_{k\u22121},\u00b7) and a point with x>x_{k\u22121}, which is impossible with only one point off the given row. Thus (4,x_{k\u22121}) is unique. If some column has \u22653 points, the vertical analogue (type 3) applies.\nOtherwise, every row and every column has \u22642 points. If there is a row with exactly two points, let its smaller x be \u03b1. If no other row contains both (\u03b1,\u00b7) and a point to its right, then by Theorem 1 (type 4) we have T_4(\u03b1)=1. Otherwise there exists a second row with exactly two points and the same left endpoint \u03b1, so column \u03b1 contains exactly two points at distinct y-values y_1\u2260y_2. Let \u03b2=min{y_1,y_2}. In column \u03b1 there is exactly one point above \u03b2, and because rows have \u22642 points and |U|=4, no other column contains a point at row \u03b2. Hence T_3(\u03b2)=1 and the color (3,\u03b2) is unique.\nFinally, if no row has two points, then each row has exactly one point. If some column has two points, let \u03b2 be the lower y on that column; at row \u03b2 only that column contributes and v(\u03b2)=1, so T_3(\u03b2)=1. If no column has two points either, U is an antichain, and Theorem 4 gives a unique type-2 color. In all cases a unique color exists.\n",
