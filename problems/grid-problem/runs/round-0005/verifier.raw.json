I flag the specific issues and give fixes, plus concrete next steps.\\n\\nProver 01\\n- Lemma H′ (unique-maximal + boundary thresholds ⇒ unique type 1) is correct as stated. The reasoning that any NE neighbor of p off the boundary would contradict p ∈ Max(S), and that the boundary thresholds p_x ≥ α₂ and p_y ≥ β₂ isolate m as the only NE neighbor, is sound. This is a valuable trigger in the unique-maximal regime.\\n- Lemma K (top-row pivot ⇒ unique type 4) is also correct; it is a clean application of the type-4 multiplicity formula when α₂’s column does not reappear below the top row.\\n- Lemma K′ as written is too weak to conclude uniqueness of (3,β₂). Your proof uses an extra condition (“no other contributors to T_3(β₂)”), but the formal statement does not impose it. Counterexample: U = {(5,5),(5,2),(1,2),(1,4)} has R ≠ ∅ and no (5,3),(5,4), yet T_3(2)=v_5(2)+v_1(2)=1+1=2, so (3,2) is not unique. A corrected safe form is: if row β₂ is a singleton (only (X,β₂)) and column X has exactly one point above β₂, then (3,β₂) is unique (this is an instance of the singleton+extension trigger).\\n- Proposition P4 (|U|=4 ⇒ a unique color): the idea and many subcases are right, but Subcase 2c (“If no row has 2 points, then no column has 2 points”) is false. Counterexample: U = {(1,1),(1,3),(2,2),(2,4)}. Nonetheless, P4 is true; it just needs a revised case split that also handles the dual column patterns. I supply a corrected proof in output.md.\\n- Your planned Lemma D′ (robust L-corner) is correct and immediate from the type-2 formula; I’ve formalized and added it to output.md.\\n\\nProver 02\\n- Lemma XR (row ∪ column support ⇒ a unique 3/4 color) is correct and useful. It cleanly settles the unique-maximal subcase S=∅ and more generally any “cross-shaped” support.\\n- Lemma J (empty L-corner ⇒ unique type 2) as stated is false: forbidding points only in the open segments (β,β′) and (α,α′) is insufficient. Counterexample: with (α,β′)=(1,2) and (α′,β)=(3,1), add (1,5) and (5,1). Then r_U(1,1)=2 and s_U(1,1)=2, so the color (2,1,1) has multiplicity 4. The correct sufficient condition is exactly that r_U(α,β)=s_U(α,β)=1, i.e., no other points above (α,β) in its column and no other points to the right on its row beyond the one specified neighbor.\\n- Lemma L (maxima corner via “topmost/rightmost”) is too weak: “m_i topmost in column x_i” does not prevent extra points with y_{i+1}<y<y_i in that column, so R_i can exceed 1. Counterexample: U = {(2,5),(5,2),(2,4)}; m_i=(2,5), m_{i+1}=(5,2) are consecutive maxima, m_i is topmost in column 2, m_{i+1} is rightmost in row 2, yet r_U(2,2)=2 and the color (2,2,2) is not unique. I’ve added a robust version (our Lemma D′) that explicitly requires R_i=S_i=1.\\n- Your “Fact” about unique maximal implies X, Y are global maxima is correct and helpful. The S=∅ subcase is now fully covered by Lemma XR.\\n\\nWhat I curated into output.md this round\\n- Robust L-corner uniqueness (type 2) as a general trigger (formal, with proof).\\n- Cross-shape (row ∪ column) uniqueness.\\n- Unique-maximal triggers: H′ (SW-max + thresholds ⇒ unique type 1) and the top-row pivot K (⇒ unique type 4).\\n- A corrected, complete proof that every 4-point set admits a uniquely colored edge.\\n\\nNext steps (precise and auditable)\\n1) Unique-maximal case completion: Prove a trichotomy that for a unique maximal m, at least one of H′, K, or the column-dual of K (in its safe, singleton+extension form) fires, or else a robust L-corner (D′) occurs for a carefully chosen p ∈ Max(S). Suggested choice: pick p ∈ Max(S) with maximal x, and among those maximal y. Let a=(α_top,Y) be the nearest top-row point with α_top>p_x (if any) and b=(X,β_right) the nearest right-column point with β_right>p_y (if any). Show: either a or b is absent (triggering H′), or one of the open segments above/right of p is empty (trigger D′), or α_top (resp. β_right) is a singleton base (trigger K or its safe column-dual).\\n2) Maxima-scan strengthening: For consecutive maxima, formalize and use D′ as the robust certificate; when D′ fails, identify the specific “offending” points that inflate R_i or S_i and try to convert them into a singleton+extension on their row/column.\\n3) Stress-test on |U|=5: classify by row/column occupancy, invoke Theorems 2–6 and the new triggers to produce a clean proof, or extract the minimum unresolved subpattern as a target for a new lemma.\\n\",\"new_notes_md\":\"New curated results and corrections (this round)\\n\\n1) Robust L-corner uniqueness (type 2)\\nIf there exist α<α′ and β<β′ with (α,β′),(α′,β)∈U and, moreover, (i) (α,β) has exactly one point above it in its column (namely (α,β′)) and (ii) exactly one point to its right in its row (namely (α′,β)), then by the type-2 multiplicity formula r_U(α,β)=s_U(α,β)=1 and so the color (2,α,β) is unique. This generalizes the previously noted “2×2 rectangle with clean margins” by not requiring the NE corner (α′,β′) to be present.\\n\\n2) Cross-shape (row ∪ column) support ⇒ unique color\\nIf U is contained in the union of a single row Y and a single column X and |U|≥2, then G[U] has a uniquely colored edge. Proof: if |U∩row Y|≥2, let α be the second-largest x on that row. Since α≠X, the only row containing (α,·) inside U is Y, and on that row h_Y(α)=1. Thus T_4(α)=1 (unique type 4). Otherwise |U∩column X|≥2 and the vertical analogue gives a unique type 3.\\n\\n3) Unique-maximal triggers\\nLet U have a unique maximal m=(X,Y) in the product order. Then X and Y are the global maxima of the used x- and y-coordinates. Define T={x<X : (x,Y)∈U} with α₂=max T (if T≠∅) and R={y<Y : (X,y)∈U} with β₂=max R (if R≠∅). Let S={p∈U : p_x<X and p_y<Y} and let Max(S) denote the set of product-maximal elements of S.\\n- H′ (SW-max + boundary thresholds ⇒ unique type 1). If S≠∅ and there exists p∈Max(S) with p_x≥α₂ and p_y≥β₂, then p has exactly one NE neighbor in U (namely m), hence the color (1,p_x,p_y) is unique.\\n- K (top-row pivot ⇒ unique type 4). If T≠∅ and the column α₂ contains no point below Y, then T_4(α₂)=1, realized by the top-row edge between (α₂,Y) and m.\\nRemark: The column-dual must be formulated with care (see below) to avoid extra contributors in T_3(β₂).\\n\\nCorrections to proposed lemmas\\n- The proposed Lemma J (empty L-corner ⇒ unique type 2) was too weak: forbidding points only in the open segments (β,β′) and (α,α′) does not preclude additional points above β′ or to the right of α′. A correct sufficient condition is exactly r_U(α,β)=s_U(α,β)=1 (see robust L-corner above). Counterexample to the weak form: U={(1,2),(3,1),(1,5),(5,1)} satisfies the stated emptiness on (1, y∈(1,2)) and (x∈(1,3),1) but yields multiplicity 4 for color (2,1,1).\\n- The proposed Lemma K′ (right-column pivot ⇒ unique type 3) as stated omitted the requirement that no other columns contribute to T_3(β₂). A safe version is the singleton+extension trigger: if row β₂ is a singleton (only (X,β₂)) and column X has exactly one point above β₂ (necessarily m in the unique-maximal regime), then T_3(β₂)=1. Counterexample to the weak form: U={(5,5),(5,2),(1,2),(1,4)} makes T_3(2)=2.\\n- The proposed Lemma L (top/right extremality of consecutive maxima ⇒ unique type 2) is false without excluding intermediate points in column x_i above y_{i+1} (or in row y_{i+1} to the right of x_i). Counterexample: U={(2,5),(5,2),(2,4)} satisfies “m_i topmost” and “m_{i+1} rightmost,” yet r_U(2,2)=2.\\n\\nFour-point sets (|U|=4)\\nThe claim that every 4-point configuration admits a uniquely colored edge is true; a corrected complete proof is added to output.md. The flawed claim “if no row has 2 points, then no column has 2 points” is refuted by U={(1,1),(1,3),(2,2),(2,4)}. The corrected proof handles all row/column occupancy patterns (4), (3+1), (2+2), (2+1+1), and (1+1+1+1), using type-3/4 triggers or the antichain lemma.\\n\\nRoadmap for the unique-maximal case\\n- S=∅ is settled by the cross-shape lemma.\\n- For S≠∅, aim for a trichotomy: H′ or K (or the safe column-dual) or a robust L-corner (D′) must fire. A workable extremal choice is p∈Max(S) with maximal x and, among those, maximal y; analyze its nearest boundary neighbors and the emptiness of the two open segments above/right of p. If both segments are populated, try to extract a singleton+extension on the boundary or an L-corner between consecutive top-row/right-column supports.\\n\",\"new_notes_append\":\"True\",\"new_outputs_md\":\"Theorem 7 (Robust L-corner uniqueness for type 2).\\nLet α<α′ and β<β′. Suppose (α,β′),(α′,β)∈U, and in column α there is exactly one point above β (namely (α,β′)), and in row β there is exactly one point to the right of α (namely (α′,β)). Then the color (2,α,β) occurs exactly once in G[U].\\nProof. By Theorem 1 (type 2), r_U(α,β)=1 and s_U(α,β)=1, hence the multiplicity r_U·s_U=1.\\n\\nTheorem 8 (Row ∪ column support ⇒ a unique color).\\nAssume U⊆({x=X}×[n]) ∪ ([n]×{y=Y}) and |U|≥2. Then G[U] has a uniquely colored edge.\\nProof. If U⊆{x=X}×[n] or U⊆[n]×{y=Y}, Theorem 2 applies. Otherwise U meets both the row and the column. If |U∩([n]×{Y})|≥2, list its x-coordinates x_1<⋯<x_m and set α=x_{m−1}. Since α≠X and U⊆(column X)∪(row Y), the only β with (α,β)∈U is β=Y. On row Y, h_Y(α)=1. Hence T_4(α)=1 by Theorem 1 (type 4). If instead |U∩({X}×[n])|≥2, the vertical analogue yields a unique type-3 color.\\n\\nTheorem 9 (Unique-maximal: SW-max with boundary thresholds ⇒ unique type 1).\\nSuppose U has a unique maximal element m=(X,Y) in the product order. Let T={x<X : (x,Y)∈U} and R={y<Y : (X,y)∈U}, with α₂=max T if T≠∅ (and α₂=−∞ otherwise), and β₂=max R if R≠∅ (and β₂=−∞ otherwise). Let S={p∈U : p_x<X and p_y<Y}. If S≠∅ and there exists p∈Max(S) (for the product order) with p_x≥α₂ and p_y≥β₂, then the color (1,p_x,p_y) is unique.\\nProof. Any NE neighbor q of p with q_x<X and q_y<Y would satisfy q≻p and lie in S, contradicting p∈Max(S). Thus every NE neighbor of p lies on row Y or column X. Because p_x≥α₂, there is no (x,Y)∈U with p_x<x<X, and because p_y≥β₂, there is no (X,y)∈U with p_y<y<Y. Hence the only possible NE neighbor is m. By Theorem 1 (type 1), the multiplicity of (1,p_x,p_y) equals the number of NE neighbors of p, namely 1.\\n\\nTheorem 10 (Unique-maximal: top-row pivot ⇒ unique type 4).\\nIn the setting of Theorem 9, if T≠∅ and the column α₂ contains no point below Y, then the color (4,α₂) occurs exactly once in G[U].\\nProof. On row Y, the point (α₂,Y) has exactly one right neighbor, (X,Y), so h_Y(α₂)=1. For β≠Y there is no (α₂,β)∈U by hypothesis, and there are no β>Y in U when m is the unique maximal. Therefore T_4(α₂)=h_Y(α₂)=1 by Theorem 1 (type 4).\\n\\nTheorem 11 (Every four-point set admits a uniquely colored edge).\\nIf |U|=4, then G[U] has a uniquely colored edge.\\nProof. If some row has ≥3 points, list the x-coordinates on that row as x_1<⋯<x_k with k≥3. The rightmost edge on that row has color (4,x_{k−1}). To realize (4,x_{k−1}) elsewhere would require a different row containing both (x_{k−1},·) and a point with x>x_{k−1}, which is impossible with only one point off the given row. Thus (4,x_{k−1}) is unique. If some column has ≥3 points, the vertical analogue (type 3) applies.\\nOtherwise, every row and every column has ≤2 points. If there is a row with exactly two points, let its smaller x be α. If no other row contains both (α,·) and a point to its right, then by Theorem 1 (type 4) we have T_4(α)=1. Otherwise there exists a second row with exactly two points and the same left endpoint α, so column α contains exactly two points at distinct y-values y_1≠y_2. Let β=min{y_1,y_2}. In column α there is exactly one point above β, and because rows have ≤2 points and |U|=4, no other column contains a point at row β. Hence T_3(β)=1 and the color (3,β) is unique.\\nFinally, if no row has two points, then each row has exactly one point. If some column has two points, let β be the lower y on that column; at row β only that column contributes and v(β)=1, so T_3(β)=1. If no column has two points either, U is an antichain, and Theorem 4 gives a unique type-2 color. In all cases a unique color exists.\\n\",\"new_outputs_append\":\"True\",\"verdict\":\"partial success\"}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"auto","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"VerifierNewSchema","schema_":{"properties":{"feedback_md":{"title":"Feedback Md","type":"string"},"new_notes_md":{"title":"New Notes Md","type":"string"},"new_notes_append":{"title":"New Notes Append","type":"string"},"new_outputs_md":{"title":"New Outputs Md","type":"string"},"new_outputs_append":{"title":"New Outputs Append","type":"string"},"verdict":{"title":"Verdict","type":"string"}},"required":["feedback_md","new_notes_md","new_notes_append","new_outputs_md","new_outputs_append","verdict"],"title":"VerifierNewSchema","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":11017,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":20073,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":16128},"total_tokens":31090},"user":null,"store":true}
