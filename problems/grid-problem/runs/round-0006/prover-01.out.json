In the subcase \u201cOtherwise there exists a second row with exactly two points and the same left endpoint \u03b1, so column \u03b1 contains exactly two points at distinct y-values y_1\u2260y_2. Let \u03b2=min{y_1,y_2}. \u2026 no other column contains a point at row \u03b2. Hence T_3(\u03b2)=1.\u201d The italicized claim is false in general. Counterexample: the 2\u00d72 rectangle U={(1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(2,2)} has two rows with the same left endpoint \u03b1=1 and also has a second column with a point at the lower row \u03b2=1 (namely (2,1)), and moreover that second column also has a point above (2,2). Here T_3(1)=2 (columns 1 and 2 both contribute one), so (3,1) is not unique. \n  \u2022 Fix: This subcase can be rescued cleanly using Theorem 7 (robust L-corner, type 2): for the bottom-left corner (\u03b1,\u03b2), r_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)=1 and s_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)=1, hence the color (2,\u03b1,\u03b2) is unique, regardless of whether (\u03b1',\u03b2')=(2,2) is present. Suggestion: replace the \u201ctype-3 uniqueness\u201d conclusion in this subcase by an application of Theorem 7 to (\u03b1,\u03b2) (the lower of the two rows).\n\n- The other theorems (1\u201310) remain sound as stated. In particular, the multiplicity formulas (Theorem 1), the single-line and singleton+extension triggers (Theorems 2\u20133), the antichain and clean consecutive-maxima gaps (Theorems 4\u20135), the |U|=3 classification (Theorem 6), the robust L-corner trigger (Theorem 7), the cross-shape lemma (Theorem 8), and the unique-maximal triggers H\u2032 and the top-row pivot K (Theorems 9\u201310) are correct and useful.\n\n### New, rigorously stated micro-lemmas (safe global triggers)\n\n- Lemma R4 (row-of-two with globally unique left endpoint \u21d2 unique type 4). Suppose some row \u03b2 contains exactly two points (\u03b1,\u03b2),(\u03b1',\u03b2) with \u03b1<\u03b1'. If for every other row \u03b2' either (\u03b1,\u03b2')\u2209U or there is no point (x,\u03b2') with x>\u03b1, then T_4(\u03b1)=1 and the horizontal edge between (\u03b1,\u03b2) and (\u03b1',\u03b2) certifies a unique color (4,\u03b1).\n  Proof. By Theorem 1 (type 4), T_4(\u03b1)=\u2211_{\u03b2''} 1_{(\u03b1,\u03b2'')}\u00b7h_{\u03b2''}(\u03b1). The unique contributing row is \u03b2 with h_\u03b2(\u03b1)=1; all other rows have either no (\u03b1,\u03b2'') or h_{\u03b2''}(\u03b1)=0. Hence T_4(\u03b1)=1.\n\n- Lemma R3 (column-of-two with globally unique lower endpoint \u21d2 unique type 3; dual of R4). Suppose some column \u03b1 contains exactly two points (\u03b1,\u03b2),(\u03b1,\u03b2') with \u03b2<\u03b2'. If for every other column \u03b1' either (\u03b1',\u03b2)\u2209U or there is no point (\u03b1',y) with y>\u03b2, then T_3(\u03b2)=1 and the vertical edge between (\u03b1,\u03b2) and (\u03b1,\u03b2') certifies a unique color (3,\u03b2).\n\n- Lemma R1 (maximal-S bound on local rays). Let U have a unique maximal m=(X,Y). If p=(\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2208Max(S), where S={u\u2208U: u_x<X,u_y<Y}, then r_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)\u22641 and s_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)\u22641.\n  Proof. If there are two distinct points above \u03b2 in column \u03b1 below Y, the lower of them is in S and is NE of p, contradicting p\u2208Max(S). Hence at most one such point below Y exists. A further point at y=Y may exist at (\u03b1,Y), so r_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)\u22641. The argument for s_U is analogous: two distinct points to the right of \u03b1 below X would give a point in S that is E of p (and hence NE once we account for \u03b2 unchanged), contradicting maximality. Thus s_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)\u22641.\n  Why useful: For p\u2208Max(S), the type\u20132 counts r_U(\u03b1,\u03b2), s_U(\u03b1,\u03b2) are each 0 or 1. This sharply restricts how (2,\u03b1,\u03b2) can fail to be unique and localizes the obstruction exclusively to the boundary (top row/right column), aligning with H\u2032 and K.\n\n- Corollary (R1 \u21d2 \u201cboundary-only\u201d obstruction for type 1). With notation as in R1, all NE neighbors of p lie on the top row or right column. Moreover, p has exactly one NE neighbor iff both of the following hold: there is no top-row point strictly to the right of \u03b1 other than m, and there is no right-column point strictly above \u03b2 other than m. This rephrases H\u2032 and gives a checkable certificate for unique type 1 at SW-maxima p.\n\n### Examples to probe and validate the micro-lemmas\n\n- R4 example. U={(2,5),(5,5)}\u222a{(1,1),(3,2),(4,7)}. Row \u03b2=5 has exactly two points at x=2,5. Column \u03b1=2 does not appear in any other row with a right neighbor (there is no (2,\u03b2') with any x>2 in that row). Hence T_4(2)=1; the edge (2,5)\u2013(5,5) is uniquely colored (4,2).\n\n- R3 example (dual). U={(6,2),(6,4)}\u222a{(1,1),(5,3),(7,7)}. Column \u03b1=6 has exactly two points at y=2,4. No other column has a point on row \u03b2=2 with a vertical extension above. So T_3(2)=1; the edge (6,2)\u2013(6,4) is uniquely colored (3,2).\n\n- R1 boundary-only obstruction. U has unique maximal m=(7,7). Let p be (3,3) and assume p\u2208Max(S). Then r_U(3,3), s_U(3,3) \u2208{0,1}. If r_U(3,3)=s_U(3,3)=1 fails, the only reason p can have \u22652 NE neighbors is through top-row/right-column points strictly beyond p. This directs the search to H\u2032/K triggers.\n\n### Ideas toward finishing the unique-maximal case (pivot-or-corner search)\n\n- Goal: Prove that for U with a unique maximal m, one of the following triggers fires: (i) H\u2032 (Theorem 9), (ii) K (Theorem 10), (iii) the column-dual of K in a safe form (Singleton+extension, Theorem 3), or (iv) a robust L-corner (Theorem 7) at some (\u03b1,\u03b2)=(p_x,p_y) for p\u2208Max(S).\n\n- Extremal selection and consequences. Choose p\u2208Max(S) with maximal x and, among those, maximal y. By R1, r_U(p_x,p_y), s_U(p_x,p_y)\u2208{0,1}. There are three stable regimes:\n  \u2022 Regime A: Both are 1 and neither extra boundary point exists beyond m (i.e., H\u2032 holds). Then type\u20131 unique at p.\n  \u2022 Regime B: Exactly one of r or s is 1. Then (2,p_x,p_y) cannot be unique. However, the presence of exactly one vertical (or horizontal) extension at p often promotes a singleton+extension trigger on the corresponding row/column. Concretely, if r=1 and s=0, then column p_x has exactly one point above p_y and\u2014with the choice of p maximal in x and then y\u2014there is strong evidence that row p_y has no right extension other than a possible point at X (which would imply s=1). If additionally column p_x is a singleton at row p_y, Lemma R3 yields a unique type\u20133 color. A symmetric check applies when s=1 and r=0 via Lemma R4.\n  \u2022 Regime C: r=s=0. Then p has no vertical/horizontal extension, hence its NE neighbors, if any, must lie solely on the two boundary sets (top row and right column). If neither K nor the safe column-dual fires, both boundaries must be \u201cpopulated.\u201d In this situation, the nearest top-row point (a,Y) to the right of p and the nearest right-column point (X,b) above p together form, with p, an empty L-corner frame. Choosing a point q on one of the two open segments would contradict p\u2019s maximality (R1). Thus the open segments at p are empty, and (by Theorem 7) (2,p_x,p_y) is unique. I will formalize the \u201cempty segments\u201d deduction next round by a careful nearest-neighbor argument.\n\nWhy useful: This reduces the unique-maximal case to checking finitely many local patterns around a single extremal p, and provides explicit callable triggers in each regime.\n\n### Refinement for maxima pairs (toward |Max(U)|\u22652)\n\n- Observation (consecutive maxima rays are disjoint). With maxima m_i=(x_i,y_i) in x-increasing order, the horizontal rays in row y_{i+1} to the right of x_i (counted by S_i) and the vertical rays in column x_i above y_{i+1} (counted by R_i) are anchored at distinct rows/columns across different i. Thus any global assumption \u201cS_i\u22652 for all i\u201d or \u201cR_i\u22652 for all i\u201d enforces many distinct rows/columns carrying extra extensions. This abundance should force a singleton+extension trigger (Theorem 3) on some row/column or a robust L-corner (Theorem 7) where exactly one extension is present. I will turn this heuristic into a counting lemma: if S_i\u22652 for all i and R_i\u22652 for all i, then there exists \u03b1 or \u03b2 with exactly one extension and a unique base, yielding a type\u20133/4 unique color.\n\n### Next steps (concrete and auditable)\n\n1) Correct the |U|=4 proof in output.md by replacing the faulty type\u20133 subcase with a direct application of Theorem 7 (robust L-corner) at the lower row\u2019s left endpoint. I will write a concise replacement paragraph for the verifier to curate.\n\n2) Formalize the nearest-neighbor \u201cempty L-segments\u201d argument in Regime C for the unique-maximal case to derive Theorem 7 at (p_x,p_y). This will close the remaining subcase under a precise selection of p\u2208Max(S).\n\n3) Develop a counting lemma for |Max(U)|\u22652: if for all i both S_i\u22652 and R_i\u22652, then either a singleton+extension (Theorem 3) occurs or a robust L-corner (Theorem 7) occurs among the set of pairs { (x_i,y_{i+1}) }. The proof will exploit the disjointness of the rows {y_{i+1}} and columns {x_i} across i.\n\n4) Optional small-case stress test: push the verified bound to |U|=5 by pattern analysis using Theorems 2\u20137 and Lemmas R1/R3/R4, identifying any residual subpatterns that still require a bespoke trigger.\n\n### Summary\n- Identified and corrected a flaw in the |U|=4 argument; Theorem 7 (robust L-corner) cleanly resolves the affected subcase (including the 2\u00d72 rectangle).\n- Added safe global triggers R4/R3 (two-on-a-line with globally unique base) and a structural bound R1 on r_U and s_U at SW-maxima in the unique-maximal regime, crystallizing that only boundary points can obstruct type\u20131 uniqueness there.\n- Outlined a tight pivot-or-corner strategy around an extremal p to finish the unique-maximal case, and a plan to convert \u201call consecutive maxima are heavy\u201d into a singleton+extension or L-corner witness.\n"
