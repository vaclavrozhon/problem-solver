In the subcase where two distinct rows each have exactly two points and share the same left endpoint \u03b1, the proof claims: \u201cno other column contains a point at row \u03b2,\u201d where \u03b2 is the lower of the two y-values in column \u03b1. This is incorrect: the very row \u03b2 contains a second point to the right (by assumption that row \u03b2 has two points), so there is at least one other column at row \u03b2. The desired uniqueness T_3(\u03b2)=1 must additionally ensure that no other column at row \u03b2 contributes a vertical edge above \u03b2. A correct fix is straightforward:\n  - If the right endpoints on the two rows are distinct (\u03b3_1\u2260\u03b3_2), then at row \u03b2=\u03b2_1, the only column contributing to T_3(\u03b2_1) is \u03b1, so T_3(\u03b2_1)=1 and (3,\u03b2_1) is unique.\n  - If the right endpoints coincide (\u03b3_1=\u03b3_2=\u03b3), then the four points form a full rectangle and (2,\u03b1,\u03b2_1) is unique by r_U(\u03b1,\u03b2_1)=s_U(\u03b1,\u03b2_1)=1 (the robust L-corner/Type\u20132 formula). This corrects the subcase.\n\nNo other issues found this round; Theorems 1\u201310 look solid as stated and proved. Theorem 6\u2019s final bullet (the 3-point permutations) is correct but terse; it is acceptable as a curated fact.\n\n### New, checkable lemmas (unique-maximal case consolidation)\n\nLet U have a unique maximal element m=(X,Y) in the product order, and let S={p\u2208U: p_x<X and p_y<Y}. Write Max(S) for the set of product-order maximal points in S.\n\n- Lemma UM1 (SW-max: boundary-aligned neighbors are the only NE neighbors). Let p=(\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2208Max(S). Then:\n  - There is no q\u2208U with x=\u03b1 and \u03b2<y<Y (else q\u2208S and q\u227bp).\n  - There is no q\u2208U with y=\u03b2 and \u03b1<x<X (else q\u2208S and q\u227dp with x>\u03b1, contradicting p maximal in S).\n  - Consequently, any NE neighbor of p lies on the top row or right column: the only possible NE neighbors are (\u03b1,Y) (if present) and/or (X,\u03b2) (if present), besides m itself.\n  Proof. Immediate from product-order maximality of p and the definitions above.\n  Why useful: Reduces NE-neighbor checks at p\u2208Max(S) to two boundary locations, enabling immediate uniqueness triggers below.\n\n- Lemma UM2 (SW-max + boundary alignment \u21d2 immediate uniqueness). With notation as above and p=(\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2208Max(S):\n  - If both (\u03b1,Y) and (X,\u03b2) lie in U, then r_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)=1 and s_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)=1 by UM1, and the color (2,\u03b1,\u03b2) is unique (Type\u20132 formula).\n  - If exactly one of (\u03b1,Y),(X,\u03b2) lies in U, then p has exactly one NE neighbor, so the color (1,\u03b1,\u03b2) is unique (Type\u20131 formula).\n  Proof. By UM1, no other contributors exist on the relevant column/row; hence r_U,s_U\u2208{0,1} with the stated values, yielding the two cases.\n  Why useful: Gives a complete dichotomy at a single SW-maximal point; as soon as one boundary alignment occurs, we obtain a unique color of type 1 or 2.\n\n- Corollary UM3 (partial resolution of the unique-maximal regime). If S\u2260\u2205 and there exists p\u2208Max(S) for which (\u03b1,Y)\u2208U or (X,\u03b2)\u2208U, then G[U] has a uniquely colored edge (by UM2). If S=\u2205, the configuration is supported on a row\u222acolumn and Lemma 8 (cross-shape) applies. Thus the only unresolved unique-maximal subcase is when S\u2260\u2205 and for every p=(\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2208Max(S), neither (\u03b1,Y) nor (X,\u03b2) lies in U.\n  Why useful: This isolates a small, concrete \u201chard subcase\u201d and shows that most unique-maximal configurations are already settled by existing tools.\n\n### Corrected and streamlined proof for |U|=4 (to replace the flawed subcase)\n\nClaim P4\u2019 (Every |U|=4 has a unique color). The overall structure in Theorem 11 is right; we refine the \u201ctwo 2-point rows with common left endpoint \u03b1\u201d subcase.\n- Suppose U has two distinct rows \u03b2_1<\u03b2_2 with points {(\u03b1,\u03b2_i),(\u03b3_i,\u03b2_i)} for i=1,2 and \u03b3_i>\u03b1. If \u03b3_1\u2260\u03b3_2, then at row \u03b2_1 only column \u03b1 contributes a vertical edge above \u03b2_1 (column \u03b3_1 has no point above \u03b2_1 with only four points total), hence T_3(\u03b2_1)=1 and (3,\u03b2_1) is unique. If \u03b3_1=\u03b3_2=\u03b3, U is the four corners of a rectangle; then r_U(\u03b1,\u03b2_1)=s_U(\u03b1,\u03b2_1)=1 and (2,\u03b1,\u03b2_1) is unique (Theorem 7). All other subcases are handled exactly as in Theorem 11.\n- This closes the gap noted above. (I recommend the verifier updates output.md accordingly.)\n\n### Additional small, robust triggers\n\n- Lemma D\u2032 (explicit consecutive-maxima L-corner). Let M=Max(U) = {(x_i,y_i)} with x_1<\u22ef<x_k and y_1>\u22ef>y_k. If for some i we have no point (x_i,y) with y_{i+1}<y<y_i and no point (x,y_{i+1}) with x_i<x<x_{i+1}, then r_U(x_i,y_{i+1})=s_U(x_i,y_{i+1})=1 and (2,x_i,y_{i+1}) is unique.\n  Proof. Immediate from the Type\u20132 formula; this is the maxima-specialization of Theorem 7.\n  Why useful: A clean, local certificate when scanning consecutive maxima; tolerates arbitrary points elsewhere.\n\n### Examples and checks\n\n- UM2 in action. Let U={(2,2),(2,5),(4,5),(5,3),(5,5)} with unique maximum m=(5,5). S has Max(S) points at (2,2) and (5,3)\u2209S; pick p=(2,2). Both (2,5) and (5,2) exist? Here (5,2) is absent, (2,5) present \u21d2 p has exactly one NE neighbor \u21d2 (1,2,2) is unique by UM2.\n- Correcting Theorem 11 subcase. Take U={(1,1),(3,1),(1,4),(5,4)}: two 2-point rows sharing \u03b1=1, with right endpoints 3 and 5 (distinct). Then T_3(1)=1 via column 1, hence (3,1) unique. If instead U={(1,1),(5,1),(1,4),(5,4)}, we get a rectangle and (2,1,1) unique (r=s=1).\n- Lemma D\u2032 edge case. U with consecutive maxima m_1=(2,7), m_2=(6,3), and no points on (x=2, y\u2208{4,5,6}) nor (y=3, x\u2208{3,4,5}). Then (2,2,3) is unique.\n\n### Obstacles and why some attempts fail\n\n- Completing the unique-maximal case. The unresolved subcase is: S\u2260\u2205 and every p\u2208Max(S) has neither (\u03b1,Y) nor (X,\u03b2) present. UM2 doesn\u2019t fire; Theorem 10 (top-row pivot) might also fail if every non-rightmost top-row column reappears below Y. A na\u00efve \u201ctake the closest p to the corner\u201d can still leave a dominating point at the same y to the right inside S, hence p\u2209Max(S). This shows the need for a careful extremal choice and/or a counting/chain argument over Max(S).\n- Multiple maxima regime. Even when Lemma D\u2032 fails for every adjacent pair (extra points inflate R_i or S_i), those extra points need not directly create a singleton+extension (Types 3/4) without additional constraints. A more global aggregation or an iterative extraction (turn an \u201coffending\u201d point into a boundary singleton) seems necessary.\n\n### Ideas/next steps (auditable)\n\n1) Complete the unique-maximal regime using UM2:\n   - For S\u2260\u2205, either some p\u2208Max(S) is boundary-aligned (UM2 triggers), or none are. In the latter, show that the second-rightmost top-row column \u03b1\u2082 has its highest sub-top-row point q=(\u03b1\u2082,\u03b2) in S and that q\u2208Max(S). If so, (\u03b1\u2082,Y) exists and UM2 fires (contradicting the assumption). The key step is proving q\u2208Max(S). I will formalize: pick \u03b1\u2082 maximal among top-row x\u2019s below X; define \u03b2=max{y<Y : (\u03b1\u2082,y)\u2208U}. Then show there is no r\u2208S with r_x\u2265\u03b1\u2082, r_y\u2265\u03b2 and (r_x,r_y)\u2260(\u03b1\u2082,\u03b2) unless r lies on the right column or top row (which cannot increase both coordinates), yielding the desired maximality.\n\n2) Strengthen maxima-scan via D\u2032: For each i, if D\u2032 fails, record a specific \u201coffender\u201d on column x_i or row y_{i+1}. Try to turn an offender into a singleton+extension trigger:\n   - If there are \u22652 offenders in column x_i (strictly between y_{i+1} and y_i), then on the row of the lower offender, check whether that row is a singleton base with exactly one extension; if yes, Types 3/4 uniqueness fires by Theorem 3.\n   - If not, move to the right to the nearest offender on row y_{i+1} and repeat. The goal is a short, verifiable chain that must terminate in a singleton+extension witness.\n\n3) Curate the corrected |U|=4 proof into output.md, replacing the flawed subcase argument with the \u03b3_1\u2260\u03b3_2 vs \u03b3_1=\u03b3_2 split detailed above.\n\n4) Explore |U|=5 systematically, classifying by row/column occupancy patterns (5, 4+1, 3+2, 3+1+1, 2+2+1, 2+1+1+1, 1+1+1+1+1) and applying Theorems 2\u20137, 8\u201310, UM2, and D\u2032. This will stress-test the boundary-alignment method and likely suggest the right invariant for the general proof.\n\n### Why the new pieces help\n- UM1\u2013UM2 sharply constrain local multiplicities around SW-maximal points under unique-maximality, upgrading Theorem 9 by covering both Type 1 and Type 2 with exact if-and-only-if triggers. This eliminates many unique-maximal configurations and cleanly isolates the true obstacle.\n- The corrected |U|=4 proof removes a logical gap and adds a reusable pattern (rectangle vs. non-rectangle split) that mirrors higher-order arguments (robust L-corners and singleton+extensions).\n- Lemma D\u2032 codifies the \u201cno-intermediate points\u201d condition for consecutive maxima as a ready-to-check unique Type\u20132 certificate, a useful module for any maxima-based induction.\n\n"
