In the subcase where two distinct rows each have exactly two points and share the same left endpoint α, the proof claims: “no other column contains a point at row β,” where β is the lower of the two y-values in column α. This is incorrect: the very row β contains a second point to the right (by assumption that row β has two points), so there is at least one other column at row β. The desired uniqueness T_3(β)=1 must additionally ensure that no other column at row β contributes a vertical edge above β. A correct fix is straightforward:\n  - If the right endpoints on the two rows are distinct (γ_1≠γ_2), then at row β=β_1, the only column contributing to T_3(β_1) is α, so T_3(β_1)=1 and (3,β_1) is unique.\n  - If the right endpoints coincide (γ_1=γ_2=γ), then the four points form a full rectangle and (2,α,β_1) is unique by r_U(α,β_1)=s_U(α,β_1)=1 (the robust L-corner/Type–2 formula). This corrects the subcase.\n\nNo other issues found this round; Theorems 1–10 look solid as stated and proved. Theorem 6’s final bullet (the 3-point permutations) is correct but terse; it is acceptable as a curated fact.\n\n### New, checkable lemmas (unique-maximal case consolidation)\n\nLet U have a unique maximal element m=(X,Y) in the product order, and let S={p∈U: p_x<X and p_y<Y}. Write Max(S) for the set of product-order maximal points in S.\n\n- Lemma UM1 (SW-max: boundary-aligned neighbors are the only NE neighbors). Let p=(α,β)∈Max(S). Then:\n  - There is no q∈U with x=α and β<y<Y (else q∈S and q≻p).\n  - There is no q∈U with y=β and α<x<X (else q∈S and q≽p with x>α, contradicting p maximal in S).\n  - Consequently, any NE neighbor of p lies on the top row or right column: the only possible NE neighbors are (α,Y) (if present) and/or (X,β) (if present), besides m itself.\n  Proof. Immediate from product-order maximality of p and the definitions above.\n  Why useful: Reduces NE-neighbor checks at p∈Max(S) to two boundary locations, enabling immediate uniqueness triggers below.\n\n- Lemma UM2 (SW-max + boundary alignment ⇒ immediate uniqueness). With notation as above and p=(α,β)∈Max(S):\n  - If both (α,Y) and (X,β) lie in U, then r_U(α,β)=1 and s_U(α,β)=1 by UM1, and the color (2,α,β) is unique (Type–2 formula).\n  - If exactly one of (α,Y),(X,β) lies in U, then p has exactly one NE neighbor, so the color (1,α,β) is unique (Type–1 formula).\n  Proof. By UM1, no other contributors exist on the relevant column/row; hence r_U,s_U∈{0,1} with the stated values, yielding the two cases.\n  Why useful: Gives a complete dichotomy at a single SW-maximal point; as soon as one boundary alignment occurs, we obtain a unique color of type 1 or 2.\n\n- Corollary UM3 (partial resolution of the unique-maximal regime). If S≠∅ and there exists p∈Max(S) for which (α,Y)∈U or (X,β)∈U, then G[U] has a uniquely colored edge (by UM2). If S=∅, the configuration is supported on a row∪column and Lemma 8 (cross-shape) applies. Thus the only unresolved unique-maximal subcase is when S≠∅ and for every p=(α,β)∈Max(S), neither (α,Y) nor (X,β) lies in U.\n  Why useful: This isolates a small, concrete “hard subcase” and shows that most unique-maximal configurations are already settled by existing tools.\n\n### Corrected and streamlined proof for |U|=4 (to replace the flawed subcase)\n\nClaim P4’ (Every |U|=4 has a unique color). The overall structure in Theorem 11 is right; we refine the “two 2-point rows with common left endpoint α” subcase.\n- Suppose U has two distinct rows β_1<β_2 with points {(α,β_i),(γ_i,β_i)} for i=1,2 and γ_i>α. If γ_1≠γ_2, then at row β_1 only column α contributes a vertical edge above β_1 (column γ_1 has no point above β_1 with only four points total), hence T_3(β_1)=1 and (3,β_1) is unique. If γ_1=γ_2=γ, U is the four corners of a rectangle; then r_U(α,β_1)=s_U(α,β_1)=1 and (2,α,β_1) is unique (Theorem 7). All other subcases are handled exactly as in Theorem 11.\n- This closes the gap noted above. (I recommend the verifier updates output.md accordingly.)\n\n### Additional small, robust triggers\n\n- Lemma D′ (explicit consecutive-maxima L-corner). Let M=Max(U) = {(x_i,y_i)} with x_1<⋯<x_k and y_1>⋯>y_k. If for some i we have no point (x_i,y) with y_{i+1}<y<y_i and no point (x,y_{i+1}) with x_i<x<x_{i+1}, then r_U(x_i,y_{i+1})=s_U(x_i,y_{i+1})=1 and (2,x_i,y_{i+1}) is unique.\n  Proof. Immediate from the Type–2 formula; this is the maxima-specialization of Theorem 7.\n  Why useful: A clean, local certificate when scanning consecutive maxima; tolerates arbitrary points elsewhere.\n\n### Examples and checks\n\n- UM2 in action. Let U={(2,2),(2,5),(4,5),(5,3),(5,5)} with unique maximum m=(5,5). S has Max(S) points at (2,2) and (5,3)∉S; pick p=(2,2). Both (2,5) and (5,2) exist? Here (5,2) is absent, (2,5) present ⇒ p has exactly one NE neighbor ⇒ (1,2,2) is unique by UM2.\n- Correcting Theorem 11 subcase. Take U={(1,1),(3,1),(1,4),(5,4)}: two 2-point rows sharing α=1, with right endpoints 3 and 5 (distinct). Then T_3(1)=1 via column 1, hence (3,1) unique. If instead U={(1,1),(5,1),(1,4),(5,4)}, we get a rectangle and (2,1,1) unique (r=s=1).\n- Lemma D′ edge case. U with consecutive maxima m_1=(2,7), m_2=(6,3), and no points on (x=2, y∈{4,5,6}) nor (y=3, x∈{3,4,5}). Then (2,2,3) is unique.\n\n### Obstacles and why some attempts fail\n\n- Completing the unique-maximal case. The unresolved subcase is: S≠∅ and every p∈Max(S) has neither (α,Y) nor (X,β) present. UM2 doesn’t fire; Theorem 10 (top-row pivot) might also fail if every non-rightmost top-row column reappears below Y. A naïve “take the closest p to the corner” can still leave a dominating point at the same y to the right inside S, hence p∉Max(S). This shows the need for a careful extremal choice and/or a counting/chain argument over Max(S).\n- Multiple maxima regime. Even when Lemma D′ fails for every adjacent pair (extra points inflate R_i or S_i), those extra points need not directly create a singleton+extension (Types 3/4) without additional constraints. A more global aggregation or an iterative extraction (turn an “offending” point into a boundary singleton) seems necessary.\n\n### Ideas/next steps (auditable)\n\n1) Complete the unique-maximal regime using UM2:\n   - For S≠∅, either some p∈Max(S) is boundary-aligned (UM2 triggers), or none are. In the latter, show that the second-rightmost top-row column α₂ has its highest sub-top-row point q=(α₂,β) in S and that q∈Max(S). If so, (α₂,Y) exists and UM2 fires (contradicting the assumption). The key step is proving q∈Max(S). I will formalize: pick α₂ maximal among top-row x’s below X; define β=max{y<Y : (α₂,y)∈U}. Then show there is no r∈S with r_x≥α₂, r_y≥β and (r_x,r_y)≠(α₂,β) unless r lies on the right column or top row (which cannot increase both coordinates), yielding the desired maximality.\n\n2) Strengthen maxima-scan via D′: For each i, if D′ fails, record a specific “offender” on column x_i or row y_{i+1}. Try to turn an offender into a singleton+extension trigger:\n   - If there are ≥2 offenders in column x_i (strictly between y_{i+1} and y_i), then on the row of the lower offender, check whether that row is a singleton base with exactly one extension; if yes, Types 3/4 uniqueness fires by Theorem 3.\n   - If not, move to the right to the nearest offender on row y_{i+1} and repeat. The goal is a short, verifiable chain that must terminate in a singleton+extension witness.\n\n3) Curate the corrected |U|=4 proof into output.md, replacing the flawed subcase argument with the γ_1≠γ_2 vs γ_1=γ_2 split detailed above.\n\n4) Explore |U|=5 systematically, classifying by row/column occupancy patterns (5, 4+1, 3+2, 3+1+1, 2+2+1, 2+1+1+1, 1+1+1+1+1) and applying Theorems 2–7, 8–10, UM2, and D′. This will stress-test the boundary-alignment method and likely suggest the right invariant for the general proof.\n\n### Why the new pieces help\n- UM1–UM2 sharply constrain local multiplicities around SW-maximal points under unique-maximality, upgrading Theorem 9 by covering both Type 1 and Type 2 with exact if-and-only-if triggers. This eliminates many unique-maximal configurations and cleanly isolates the true obstacle.\n- The corrected |U|=4 proof removes a logical gap and adds a reusable pattern (rectangle vs. non-rectangle split) that mirrors higher-order arguments (robust L-corners and singleton+extensions).\n- Lemma D′ codifies the “no-intermediate points” condition for consecutive maxima as a ready-to-check unique Type–2 certificate, a useful module for any maxima-based induction.\n\n"}
