  "summary_md": "Round 0006 audit: Both provers located the same gap in Theorem 11 (|U|=4): a claim that \u201cno other column contains a point at row \u03b2\u201d is false (counterexample: the 2\u00d72 rectangle). Two clean fixes were proposed: split the subcase by whether the right endpoints coincide (\u03b31\u2260\u03b32 vs \u03b31=\u03b32) or replace the argument by applying Theorem 7 (robust L-corner) at the lower-left (\u03b1,\u03b2). Apart from that subcase, Theorems 1\u201310 are sound. New, checkable micro-lemmas were introduced: R4/R3 (row/column-of-two with a globally unique base \u21d2 unique type 4/3) and R1 / UM1\u2013UM3 (for p\u2208Max(S), r_U(\u03b1,\u03b2),s_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)\u22641, so any NE neighbors lie only on the top row/right column). Using these, a pivot-or-corner plan around an extremal p\u2208Max(S) (max x, then max y) splits into regimes A/B/C and yields concrete triggers (H\u2032, K, singleton+extension, or robust L-corner). Next technical steps are stated below. Citations: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json.",

    "Identified a real gap in the |U|=4 proof: the 2\u00d72 rectangle provides a counterexample to the claimed uniqueness; two corrective fixes were given (\u03b31\u2260\u03b32 split or apply Theorem 7).",
    "All other main theorems (1\u201310) were verified to be sound; only the cited subcase needed repair.",
    "New micro-lemmas R4/R3 (row/column-of-two \u21d2 unique type 4/3) and R1/UM1\u2013UM3 (for p\u2208Max(S), r_U,s_U\u2208{0,1}, NE neighbors restricted to top row/right column) sharply constrain local multiplicities at SW-maxima.",
    "Pivot-or-corner extremal strategy: choose p\u2208Max(S) (max x then y) and partition into regimes A (r=s=1 \u2192 H\u2032/type\u20131 or type\u20132), B (exactly one of r,s=1 \u2192 singleton+extension or dual), C (r=s=0 \u2192 emptiness of L-segments \u2192 robust L-corner).",
    "Concrete reductions: the unresolved unique-maximal subcase is now localized to p\u2208Max(S) with neither boundary point present; this is amenable to a nearest-neighbor empty-segment argument or a counting lemma over maxima."

    "Replace the flawed |U|=4 paragraph in output.md with the corrected split (\u03b31\u2260\u03b32 vs \u03b31=\u03b32) or the Theorem 7 repair and produce the exact replacement text for the verifier.",
    "Formalize the Regime C nearest-neighbor \u2018empty L-segments\u2019 argument for an extremal p\u2208Max(S) to conclude a robust L-corner (Theorem 7) and close the unique-maximal case.",
    "Prove the counting lemma for |Max(U)|\u22652: if consecutive-maxima rays are all heavy (S_i,R_i\u22652), show this forces a singleton+extension or robust L-corner witness; then test the approach on |U|=5."
