## Round 0006 — 2025-08-27T19:00:46Z

### Audit of current output.md (gaps and fixes)

- Gap in Theorem 11 (|U|=4). In the subcase “Otherwise there exists a second row with exactly two points and the same left endpoint α, so column α contains exactly two points at distinct y-values y_1≠y_2. Let β=min{y_1,y_2}. … no other column contains a point at row β. Hence T_3(β)=1.” The italicized claim is false in general. Counterexample: the 2×2 rectangle U={(1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(2,2)} has two rows with the same left endpoint α=1 and also has a second column with a point at the lower row β=1 (namely (2,1)), and moreover that second column also has a point above (2,2). Here T_3(1)=2 (columns 1 and 2 both contribute one), so (3,1) is not unique. 
  • Fix: This subcase can be rescued cleanly using Theorem 7 (robust L-corner, type 2): for the bottom-left corner (α,β), r_U(α,β)=1 and s_U(α,β)=1, hence the color (2,α,β) is unique, regardless of whether (α',β')=(2,2) is present. Suggestion: replace the “type-3 uniqueness” conclusion in this subcase by an application of Theorem 7 to (α,β) (the lower of the two rows).

- The other theorems (1–10) remain sound as stated. In particular, the multiplicity formulas (Theorem 1), the single-line and singleton+extension triggers (Theorems 2–3), the antichain and clean consecutive-maxima gaps (Theorems 4–5), the |U|=3 classification (Theorem 6), the robust L-corner trigger (Theorem 7), the cross-shape lemma (Theorem 8), and the unique-maximal triggers H′ and the top-row pivot K (Theorems 9–10) are correct and useful.

### New, rigorously stated micro-lemmas (safe global triggers)

- Lemma R4 (row-of-two with globally unique left endpoint ⇒ unique type 4). Suppose some row β contains exactly two points (α,β),(α',β) with α<α'. If for every other row β' either (α,β')∉U or there is no point (x,β') with x>α, then T_4(α)=1 and the horizontal edge between (α,β) and (α',β) certifies a unique color (4,α).
  Proof. By Theorem 1 (type 4), T_4(α)=∑_{β''} 1_{(α,β'')}·h_{β''}(α). The unique contributing row is β with h_β(α)=1; all other rows have either no (α,β'') or h_{β''}(α)=0. Hence T_4(α)=1.

- Lemma R3 (column-of-two with globally unique lower endpoint ⇒ unique type 3; dual of R4). Suppose some column α contains exactly two points (α,β),(α,β') with β<β'. If for every other column α' either (α',β)∉U or there is no point (α',y) with y>β, then T_3(β)=1 and the vertical edge between (α,β) and (α,β') certifies a unique color (3,β).

- Lemma R1 (maximal-S bound on local rays). Let U have a unique maximal m=(X,Y). If p=(α,β)∈Max(S), where S={u∈U: u_x<X,u_y<Y}, then r_U(α,β)≤1 and s_U(α,β)≤1.
  Proof. If there are two distinct points above β in column α below Y, the lower of them is in S and is NE of p, contradicting p∈Max(S). Hence at most one such point below Y exists. A further point at y=Y may exist at (α,Y), so r_U(α,β)≤1. The argument for s_U is analogous: two distinct points to the right of α below X would give a point in S that is E of p (and hence NE once we account for β unchanged), contradicting maximality. Thus s_U(α,β)≤1.
  Why useful: For p∈Max(S), the type–2 counts r_U(α,β), s_U(α,β) are each 0 or 1. This sharply restricts how (2,α,β) can fail to be unique and localizes the obstruction exclusively to the boundary (top row/right column), aligning with H′ and K.

- Corollary (R1 ⇒ “boundary-only” obstruction for type 1). With notation as in R1, all NE neighbors of p lie on the top row or right column. Moreover, p has exactly one NE neighbor iff both of the following hold: there is no top-row point strictly to the right of α other than m, and there is no right-column point strictly above β other than m. This rephrases H′ and gives a checkable certificate for unique type 1 at SW-maxima p.

### Examples to probe and validate the micro-lemmas

- R4 example. U={(2,5),(5,5)}∪{(1,1),(3,2),(4,7)}. Row β=5 has exactly two points at x=2,5. Column α=2 does not appear in any other row with a right neighbor (there is no (2,β') with any x>2 in that row). Hence T_4(2)=1; the edge (2,5)–(5,5) is uniquely colored (4,2).

- R3 example (dual). U={(6,2),(6,4)}∪{(1,1),(5,3),(7,7)}. Column α=6 has exactly two points at y=2,4. No other column has a point on row β=2 with a vertical extension above. So T_3(2)=1; the edge (6,2)–(6,4) is uniquely colored (3,2).

- R1 boundary-only obstruction. U has unique maximal m=(7,7). Let p be (3,3) and assume p∈Max(S). Then r_U(3,3), s_U(3,3) ∈{0,1}. If r_U(3,3)=s_U(3,3)=1 fails, the only reason p can have ≥2 NE neighbors is through top-row/right-column points strictly beyond p. This directs the search to H′/K triggers.

### Ideas toward finishing the unique-maximal case (pivot-or-corner search)

- Goal: Prove that for U with a unique maximal m, one of the following triggers fires: (i) H′ (Theorem 9), (ii) K (Theorem 10), (iii) the column-dual of K in a safe form (Singleton+extension, Theorem 3), or (iv) a robust L-corner (Theorem 7) at some (α,β)=(p_x,p_y) for p∈Max(S).

- Extremal selection and consequences. Choose p∈Max(S) with maximal x and, among those, maximal y. By R1, r_U(p_x,p_y), s_U(p_x,p_y)∈{0,1}. There are three stable regimes:
  • Regime A: Both are 1 and neither extra boundary point exists beyond m (i.e., H′ holds). Then type–1 unique at p.
  • Regime B: Exactly one of r or s is 1. Then (2,p_x,p_y) cannot be unique. However, the presence of exactly one vertical (or horizontal) extension at p often promotes a singleton+extension trigger on the corresponding row/column. Concretely, if r=1 and s=0, then column p_x has exactly one point above p_y and—with the choice of p maximal in x and then y—there is strong evidence that row p_y has no right extension other than a possible point at X (which would imply s=1). If additionally column p_x is a singleton at row p_y, Lemma R3 yields a unique type–3 color. A symmetric check applies when s=1 and r=0 via Lemma R4.
  • Regime C: r=s=0. Then p has no vertical/horizontal extension, hence its NE neighbors, if any, must lie solely on the two boundary sets (top row and right column). If neither K nor the safe column-dual fires, both boundaries must be “populated.” In this situation, the nearest top-row point (a,Y) to the right of p and the nearest right-column point (X,b) above p together form, with p, an empty L-corner frame. Choosing a point q on one of the two open segments would contradict p’s maximality (R1). Thus the open segments at p are empty, and (by Theorem 7) (2,p_x,p_y) is unique. I will formalize the “empty segments” deduction next round by a careful nearest-neighbor argument.

Why useful: This reduces the unique-maximal case to checking finitely many local patterns around a single extremal p, and provides explicit callable triggers in each regime.

### Refinement for maxima pairs (toward |Max(U)|≥2)

- Observation (consecutive maxima rays are disjoint). With maxima m_i=(x_i,y_i) in x-increasing order, the horizontal rays in row y_{i+1} to the right of x_i (counted by S_i) and the vertical rays in column x_i above y_{i+1} (counted by R_i) are anchored at distinct rows/columns across different i. Thus any global assumption “S_i≥2 for all i” or “R_i≥2 for all i” enforces many distinct rows/columns carrying extra extensions. This abundance should force a singleton+extension trigger (Theorem 3) on some row/column or a robust L-corner (Theorem 7) where exactly one extension is present. I will turn this heuristic into a counting lemma: if S_i≥2 for all i and R_i≥2 for all i, then there exists α or β with exactly one extension and a unique base, yielding a type–3/4 unique color.

### Next steps (concrete and auditable)

1) Correct the |U|=4 proof in output.md by replacing the faulty type–3 subcase with a direct application of Theorem 7 (robust L-corner) at the lower row’s left endpoint. I will write a concise replacement paragraph for the verifier to curate.

2) Formalize the nearest-neighbor “empty L-segments” argument in Regime C for the unique-maximal case to derive Theorem 7 at (p_x,p_y). This will close the remaining subcase under a precise selection of p∈Max(S).

3) Develop a counting lemma for |Max(U)|≥2: if for all i both S_i≥2 and R_i≥2, then either a singleton+extension (Theorem 3) occurs or a robust L-corner (Theorem 7) occurs among the set of pairs { (x_i,y_{i+1}) }. The proof will exploit the disjointness of the rows {y_{i+1}} and columns {x_i} across i.

4) Optional small-case stress test: push the verified bound to |U|=5 by pattern analysis using Theorems 2–7 and Lemmas R1/R3/R4, identifying any residual subpatterns that still require a bespoke trigger.

### Summary
- Identified and corrected a flaw in the |U|=4 argument; Theorem 7 (robust L-corner) cleanly resolves the affected subcase (including the 2×2 rectangle).
- Added safe global triggers R4/R3 (two-on-a-line with globally unique base) and a structural bound R1 on r_U and s_U at SW-maxima in the unique-maximal regime, crystallizing that only boundary points can obstruct type–1 uniqueness there.
- Outlined a tight pivot-or-corner strategy around an extremal p to finish the unique-maximal case, and a plan to convert “all consecutive maxima are heavy” into a singleton+extension or L-corner witness.

### Quick audit of output.md (gaps and fixes)

- Gap in Theorem 11 (|U|=4). In the subcase where two distinct rows each have exactly two points and share the same left endpoint α, the proof claims: “no other column contains a point at row β,” where β is the lower of the two y-values in column α. This is incorrect: the very row β contains a second point to the right (by assumption that row β has two points), so there is at least one other column at row β. The desired uniqueness T_3(β)=1 must additionally ensure that no other column at row β contributes a vertical edge above β. A correct fix is straightforward:
  - If the right endpoints on the two rows are distinct (γ_1≠γ_2), then at row β=β_1, the only column contributing to T_3(β_1) is α, so T_3(β_1)=1 and (3,β_1) is unique.
  - If the right endpoints coincide (γ_1=γ_2=γ), then the four points form a full rectangle and (2,α,β_1) is unique by r_U(α,β_1)=s_U(α,β_1)=1 (the robust L-corner/Type–2 formula). This corrects the subcase.

No other issues found this round; Theorems 1–10 look solid as stated and proved. Theorem 6’s final bullet (the 3-point permutations) is correct but terse; it is acceptable as a curated fact.

### New, checkable lemmas (unique-maximal case consolidation)

Let U have a unique maximal element m=(X,Y) in the product order, and let S={p∈U: p_x<X and p_y<Y}. Write Max(S) for the set of product-order maximal points in S.

- Lemma UM1 (SW-max: boundary-aligned neighbors are the only NE neighbors). Let p=(α,β)∈Max(S). Then:
  - There is no q∈U with x=α and β<y<Y (else q∈S and q≻p).
  - There is no q∈U with y=β and α<x<X (else q∈S and q≽p with x>α, contradicting p maximal in S).
  - Consequently, any NE neighbor of p lies on the top row or right column: the only possible NE neighbors are (α,Y) (if present) and/or (X,β) (if present), besides m itself.
  Proof. Immediate from product-order maximality of p and the definitions above.
  Why useful: Reduces NE-neighbor checks at p∈Max(S) to two boundary locations, enabling immediate uniqueness triggers below.

- Lemma UM2 (SW-max + boundary alignment ⇒ immediate uniqueness). With notation as above and p=(α,β)∈Max(S):
  - If both (α,Y) and (X,β) lie in U, then r_U(α,β)=1 and s_U(α,β)=1 by UM1, and the color (2,α,β) is unique (Type–2 formula).
  - If exactly one of (α,Y),(X,β) lies in U, then p has exactly one NE neighbor, so the color (1,α,β) is unique (Type–1 formula).
  Proof. By UM1, no other contributors exist on the relevant column/row; hence r_U,s_U∈{0,1} with the stated values, yielding the two cases.
  Why useful: Gives a complete dichotomy at a single SW-maximal point; as soon as one boundary alignment occurs, we obtain a unique color of type 1 or 2.

- Corollary UM3 (partial resolution of the unique-maximal regime). If S≠∅ and there exists p∈Max(S) for which (α,Y)∈U or (X,β)∈U, then G[U] has a uniquely colored edge (by UM2). If S=∅, the configuration is supported on a row∪column and Lemma 8 (cross-shape) applies. Thus the only unresolved unique-maximal subcase is when S≠∅ and for every p=(α,β)∈Max(S), neither (α,Y) nor (X,β) lies in U.
  Why useful: This isolates a small, concrete “hard subcase” and shows that most unique-maximal configurations are already settled by existing tools.

### Corrected and streamlined proof for |U|=4 (to replace the flawed subcase)

Claim P4’ (Every |U|=4 has a unique color). The overall structure in Theorem 11 is right; we refine the “two 2-point rows with common left endpoint α” subcase.
- Suppose U has two distinct rows β_1<β_2 with points {(α,β_i),(γ_i,β_i)} for i=1,2 and γ_i>α. If γ_1≠γ_2, then at row β_1 only column α contributes a vertical edge above β_1 (column γ_1 has no point above β_1 with only four points total), hence T_3(β_1)=1 and (3,β_1) is unique. If γ_1=γ_2=γ, U is the four corners of a rectangle; then r_U(α,β_1)=s_U(α,β_1)=1 and (2,α,β_1) is unique (Theorem 7). All other subcases are handled exactly as in Theorem 11.
- This closes the gap noted above. (I recommend the verifier updates output.md accordingly.)

### Additional small, robust triggers

- Lemma D′ (explicit consecutive-maxima L-corner). Let M=Max(U) = {(x_i,y_i)} with x_1<⋯<x_k and y_1>⋯>y_k. If for some i we have no point (x_i,y) with y_{i+1}<y<y_i and no point (x,y_{i+1}) with x_i<x<x_{i+1}, then r_U(x_i,y_{i+1})=s_U(x_i,y_{i+1})=1 and (2,x_i,y_{i+1}) is unique.
  Proof. Immediate from the Type–2 formula; this is the maxima-specialization of Theorem 7.
  Why useful: A clean, local certificate when scanning consecutive maxima; tolerates arbitrary points elsewhere.

### Examples and checks

- UM2 in action. Let U={(2,2),(2,5),(4,5),(5,3),(5,5)} with unique maximum m=(5,5). S has Max(S) points at (2,2) and (5,3)∉S; pick p=(2,2). Both (2,5) and (5,2) exist? Here (5,2) is absent, (2,5) present ⇒ p has exactly one NE neighbor ⇒ (1,2,2) is unique by UM2.
- Correcting Theorem 11 subcase. Take U={(1,1),(3,1),(1,4),(5,4)}: two 2-point rows sharing α=1, with right endpoints 3 and 5 (distinct). Then T_3(1)=1 via column 1, hence (3,1) unique. If instead U={(1,1),(5,1),(1,4),(5,4)}, we get a rectangle and (2,1,1) unique (r=s=1).
- Lemma D′ edge case. U with consecutive maxima m_1=(2,7), m_2=(6,3), and no points on (x=2, y∈{4,5,6}) nor (y=3, x∈{3,4,5}). Then (2,2,3) is unique.

### Obstacles and why some attempts fail

- Completing the unique-maximal case. The unresolved subcase is: S≠∅ and every p∈Max(S) has neither (α,Y) nor (X,β) present. UM2 doesn’t fire; Theorem 10 (top-row pivot) might also fail if every non-rightmost top-row column reappears below Y. A naïve “take the closest p to the corner” can still leave a dominating point at the same y to the right inside S, hence p∉Max(S). This shows the need for a careful extremal choice and/or a counting/chain argument over Max(S).
- Multiple maxima regime. Even when Lemma D′ fails for every adjacent pair (extra points inflate R_i or S_i), those extra points need not directly create a singleton+extension (Types 3/4) without additional constraints. A more global aggregation or an iterative extraction (turn an “offending” point into a boundary singleton) seems necessary.

### Ideas/next steps (auditable)

1) Complete the unique-maximal regime using UM2:
   - For S≠∅, either some p∈Max(S) is boundary-aligned (UM2 triggers), or none are. In the latter, show that the second-rightmost top-row column α₂ has its highest sub-top-row point q=(α₂,β) in S and that q∈Max(S). If so, (α₂,Y) exists and UM2 fires (contradicting the assumption). The key step is proving q∈Max(S). I will formalize: pick α₂ maximal among top-row x’s below X; define β=max{y<Y : (α₂,y)∈U}. Then show there is no r∈S with r_x≥α₂, r_y≥β and (r_x,r_y)≠(α₂,β) unless r lies on the right column or top row (which cannot increase both coordinates), yielding the desired maximality.

2) Strengthen maxima-scan via D′: For each i, if D′ fails, record a specific “offender” on column x_i or row y_{i+1}. Try to turn an offender into a singleton+extension trigger:
   - If there are ≥2 offenders in column x_i (strictly between y_{i+1} and y_i), then on the row of the lower offender, check whether that row is a singleton base with exactly one extension; if yes, Types 3/4 uniqueness fires by Theorem 3.
   - If not, move to the right to the nearest offender on row y_{i+1} and repeat. The goal is a short, verifiable chain that must terminate in a singleton+extension witness.

3) Curate the corrected |U|=4 proof into output.md, replacing the flawed subcase argument with the γ_1≠γ_2 vs γ_1=γ_2 split detailed above.

4) Explore |U|=5 systematically, classifying by row/column occupancy patterns (5, 4+1, 3+2, 3+1+1, 2+2+1, 2+1+1+1, 1+1+1+1+1) and applying Theorems 2–7, 8–10, UM2, and D′. This will stress-test the boundary-alignment method and likely suggest the right invariant for the general proof.

### Why the new pieces help
- UM1–UM2 sharply constrain local multiplicities around SW-maximal points under unique-maximality, upgrading Theorem 9 by covering both Type 1 and Type 2 with exact if-and-only-if triggers. This eliminates many unique-maximal configurations and cleanly isolates the true obstacle.
- The corrected |U|=4 proof removes a logical gap and adds a reusable pattern (rectangle vs. non-rectangle split) that mirrors higher-order arguments (robust L-corners and singleton+extensions).
- Lemma D′ codifies the “no-intermediate points” condition for consecutive maxima as a ready-to-check unique Type–2 certificate, a useful module for any maxima-based induction.
