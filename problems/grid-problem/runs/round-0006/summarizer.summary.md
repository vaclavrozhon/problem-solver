Round 0006 audit: Both provers located the same gap in Theorem 11 (|U|=4): a claim that “no other column contains a point at row β” is false (counterexample: the 2×2 rectangle). Two clean fixes were proposed: split the subcase by whether the right endpoints coincide (γ1≠γ2 vs γ1=γ2) or replace the argument by applying Theorem 7 (robust L-corner) at the lower-left (α,β). Apart from that subcase, Theorems 1–10 are sound. New, checkable micro-lemmas were introduced: R4/R3 (row/column-of-two with a globally unique base ⇒ unique type 4/3) and R1 / UM1–UM3 (for p∈Max(S), r_U(α,β),s_U(α,β)≤1, so any NE neighbors lie only on the top row/right column). Using these, a pivot-or-corner plan around an extremal p∈Max(S) (max x, then max y) splits into regimes A/B/C and yields concrete triggers (H′, K, singleton+extension, or robust L-corner). Next technical steps are stated below. Citations: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json.
