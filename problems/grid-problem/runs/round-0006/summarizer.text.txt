  "summary_md": "Round 0006 audit: Both provers located the same gap in Theorem 11 (|U|=4): a claim that “no other column contains a point at row β” is false (counterexample: the 2×2 rectangle). Two clean fixes were proposed: split the subcase by whether the right endpoints coincide (γ1≠γ2 vs γ1=γ2) or replace the argument by applying Theorem 7 (robust L-corner) at the lower-left (α,β). Apart from that subcase, Theorems 1–10 are sound. New, checkable micro-lemmas were introduced: R4/R3 (row/column-of-two with a globally unique base ⇒ unique type 4/3) and R1 / UM1–UM3 (for p∈Max(S), r_U(α,β),s_U(α,β)≤1, so any NE neighbors lie only on the top row/right column). Using these, a pivot-or-corner plan around an extremal p∈Max(S) (max x, then max y) splits into regimes A/B/C and yields concrete triggers (H′, K, singleton+extension, or robust L-corner). Next technical steps are stated below. Citations: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json.",
  "highlights": [
    "Identified a real gap in the |U|=4 proof: the 2×2 rectangle provides a counterexample to the claimed uniqueness; two corrective fixes were given (γ1≠γ2 split or apply Theorem 7).",
    "All other main theorems (1–10) were verified to be sound; only the cited subcase needed repair.",
    "New micro-lemmas R4/R3 (row/column-of-two ⇒ unique type 4/3) and R1/UM1–UM3 (for p∈Max(S), r_U,s_U∈{0,1}, NE neighbors restricted to top row/right column) sharply constrain local multiplicities at SW-maxima.",
    "Pivot-or-corner extremal strategy: choose p∈Max(S) (max x then y) and partition into regimes A (r=s=1 → H′/type–1 or type–2), B (exactly one of r,s=1 → singleton+extension or dual), C (r=s=0 → emptiness of L-segments → robust L-corner).",
    "Concrete reductions: the unresolved unique-maximal subcase is now localized to p∈Max(S) with neither boundary point present; this is amenable to a nearest-neighbor empty-segment argument or a counting lemma over maxima."

  "next_questions": [
    "Replace the flawed |U|=4 paragraph in output.md with the corrected split (γ1≠γ2 vs γ1=γ2) or the Theorem 7 repair and produce the exact replacement text for the verifier.",
    "Formalize the Regime C nearest-neighbor ‘empty L-segments’ argument for an extremal p∈Max(S) to conclude a robust L-corner (Theorem 7) and close the unique-maximal case.",
    "Prove the counting lemma for |Max(U)|≥2: if consecutive-maxima rays are all heavy (S_i,R_i≥2), show this forces a singleton+extension or robust L-corner witness; then test the approach on |U|=5."
