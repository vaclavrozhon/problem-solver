High-level summary: Both reports correctly identify a real flaw in the |U|=4 proof (Theorem 11) in output.md. The fixes you propose are essentially sound, with two options: (i) replace the problematic Type-3 uniqueness argument by a direct application of the robust L-corner (Type-2) lemma (Theorem 7) at the bottom-left corner, or (ii) split by whether the right endpoints coincide and conclude either Type-3 (if distinct) or Type-2 (if equal). I adopt (i) because it is uniform and simpler. I have updated output.md accordingly by replacing the flawed paragraph with a short, correct application of Theorem 7; see the revised Theorem 11.

Detailed audit and critique:
- Prover 01: The counterexample to the italicized claim in Theorem 11 is valid (2×2 rectangle). Lemmas R3 and R4 (row/column-of-two with globally unique base ⇒ unique Type 4/3) are correct and follow cleanly from the Type-4/3 multiplicity formulas; they are safe “global triggers” worth tracking in notes. However, Lemma R1 as written has a gap: it tries to bound r_U(α,β) and s_U(α,β) by 1 for p∈Max(S) but only argues there cannot be two points strictly below Y/left of X; it does not rule out the presence of one such point plus (α,Y) (or (X,β)), which would make r_U or s_U equal 2. The intended conclusion is salvageable when one notes that for p∈Max(S), there are actually no points with x=α, β<y<Y and no points with y=β, α<x<X; this is precisely what Prover 02’s UM1 states and proves. So please replace R1 by UM1 (or strengthen the argument to show there cannot even be one such point within S).
- Prover 02: Your correction of the |U|=4 gap is fine, and the rectangle vs. non-rectangle split is correct. Lemma UM1 is crisp, correct, and subsumes the safe part of 01’s R1. Lemma D′ is a clean specialization of Theorem 7 to consecutive maxima and is correct. However, UM2 as stated (“if exactly one of (α,Y) and (X,β) lies in U, then p has exactly one NE neighbor”) is false without additional boundary-cleanliness assumptions. Counterexample: let m=(5,5) be unique maximal; take p=(2,2)∈Max(S); add (3,5),(4,5) on the top row, with neither (2,5) nor (5,2) present. Then p has at least two NE neighbors ((3,5),(4,5)) besides m. The correct “boundary-threshold” condition is essentially Theorem 9: require p_x≥α2 and p_y≥β2 so that no other top-row/right-column NE neighbors exist.

Value triage:
- Keep: the fix to Theorem 11 (I’ve implemented the Theorem 7-based repair), UM1, D′, and the safe triggers R3/R4. The “pivot-or-corner” plan (maximize x then y among Max(S) and analyze three regimes r,s∈{0,1}) is promising but needs formalization; keep in notes only.
- Discard/Revise: R1 (replace by UM1); UM2 (strengthen to the α2/β2-threshold form, which is Theorem 9 already in output.md).

Next steps (concrete):
1) Unique-maximal regime: Formalize the extremal choice p∈Max(S) with maximal x (and then maximal y). Prove rigorously that when r_U(p)=s_U(p)=0, the nearest top-row point to the right and nearest right-column point above cannot exist simultaneously away from m, or else one can extract a robust L-corner (Theorem 7) at p. Write the nearest-neighbor argument explicitly: use UM1 to forbid interior points on p’s row/column inside S, then show any additional boundary points force either Theorem 9/10 or Theorem 7.
2) Multiple maxima: Turn the “disjointness of rays” heuristic into a counting lemma. If for every consecutive pair (x_i,y_i),(x_{i+1},y_{i+1}) both R_i≥2 and S_i≥2, aggregate over i to force a singleton+extension (Theorem 3) in some row/column or a D′-style robust L-corner. Outline a short pigeonhole-style proof tracking how many distinct rows/columns must carry extensions.
3) Optional: Push the verified small cases to |U|=5 by row/column occupancy patterns, systematically applying Theorems 2–7, 8–10, UM1, and D′. This will surface any remaining “hard” micro-configurations to target with a final lemma.

I have appended to notes.md: (i) the erratum and fix for Theorem 11, (ii) safe global triggers R3/R4 with proofs, (iii) UM1 with proof, and (iv) a cautionary note refuting UM2, plus the extremal-regime plan and the consecutive-maxima D′ certificate. I have replaced Theorem 11 in output.md with a corrected proof that uses Theorem 7 in the problematic subcase. Verdict: partial success (we fixed a flaw and added solid auxiliary tools).
