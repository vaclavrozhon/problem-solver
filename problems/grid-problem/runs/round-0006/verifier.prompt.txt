You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md and output.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers
- notes.md (summary so far)
- output.md (rigorously proven results so far)

Guidelines:
- notes.md: should be a readable running log of interesting work. Prefer appending. Replace only if old notes are clearly misleading. Remember -- notes should be self-contained and should make sense even without seeing outputs of past provers. 
- output.md:  Think twice before you add something to this file. Everything here should be rigorous, almost publication-ready. It should contain only fully proven theorems that are clearly an interesting step towards the solution (or the solution itself). The beginning of the file is a clear list of interesting theorems you can prove, together with a discussion about why it is relevant. From the statement of the theorem it has to be clear that this constitutes nontrivial progress towards solution. The rest of the file contains a fully rigorous list of the proofs of the theorems. Keep only proven theorems with clear proofs. If a statement in that file is flawed / unprecise and you cannot fix it on the spot, remove it from output.md and instead add it to notes.md with explanation.
- Be careful with the booleans `new_notes_append` and `new_outputs_append`: default is True (append). Use False only when deliberately rewriting everything.

Tasks:
1) Audit rigor: identify unjustified steps, false statements, missing lemmas; produce minimal counterexamples.
2) Triage value: separate genuine progress from noise.
3) Guide next steps: propose what provers should try next.

In the subcase \u201cOtherwise there exists a second row with exactly two points and the same left endpoint \u03b1, so column \u03b1 contains exactly two points at distinct y-values y_1\u2260y_2. Let \u03b2=min{y_1,y_2}. \u2026 no other column contains a point at row \u03b2. Hence T_3(\u03b2)=1.\u201d The italicized claim is false in general. Counterexample: the 2\u00d72 rectangle U={(1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(2,2)} has two rows with the same left endpoint \u03b1=1 and also has a second column with a point at the lower row \u03b2=1 (namely (2,1)), and moreover that second column also has a point above (2,2). Here T_3(1)=2 (columns 1 and 2 both contribute one), so (3,1) is not unique. \n  \u2022 Fix: This subcase can be rescued cleanly using Theorem 7 (robust L-corner, type 2): for the bottom-left corner (\u03b1,\u03b2), r_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)=1 and s_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)=1, hence the color (2,\u03b1,\u03b2) is unique, regardless of whether (\u03b1',\u03b2')=(2,2) is present. Suggestion: replace the \u201ctype-3 uniqueness\u201d conclusion in this subcase by an application of Theorem 7 to (\u03b1,\u03b2) (the lower of the two rows).\n\n- The other theorems (1\u201310) remain sound as stated. In particular, the multiplicity formulas (Theorem 1), the single-line and singleton+extension triggers (Theorems 2\u20133), the antichain and clean consecutive-maxima gaps (Theorems 4\u20135), the |U|=3 classification (Theorem 6), the robust L-corner trigger (Theorem 7), the cross-shape lemma (Theorem 8), and the unique-maximal triggers H\u2032 and the top-row pivot K (Theorems 9\u201310) are correct and useful.\n\n### New, rigorously stated micro-lemmas (safe global triggers)\n\n- Lemma R4 (row-of-two with globally unique left endpoint \u21d2 unique type 4). Suppose some row \u03b2 contains exactly two points (\u03b1,\u03b2),(\u03b1',\u03b2) with \u03b1<\u03b1'. If for every other row \u03b2' either (\u03b1,\u03b2')\u2209U or there is no point (x,\u03b2') with x>\u03b1, then T_4(\u03b1)=1 and the horizontal edge between (\u03b1,\u03b2) and (\u03b1',\u03b2) certifies a unique color (4,\u03b1).\n  Proof. By Theorem 1 (type 4), T_4(\u03b1)=\u2211_{\u03b2''} 1_{(\u03b1,\u03b2'')}\u00b7h_{\u03b2''}(\u03b1). The unique contributing row is \u03b2 with h_\u03b2(\u03b1)=1; all other rows have either no (\u03b1,\u03b2'') or h_{\u03b2''}(\u03b1)=0. Hence T_4(\u03b1)=1.\n\n- Lemma R3 (column-of-two with globally unique lower endpoint \u21d2 unique type 3; dual of R4). Suppose some column \u03b1 contains exactly two points (\u03b1,\u03b2),(\u03b1,\u03b2') with \u03b2<\u03b2'. If for every other column \u03b1' either (\u03b1',\u03b2)\u2209U or there is no point (\u03b1',y) with y>\u03b2, then T_3(\u03b2)=1 and the vertical edge between (\u03b1,\u03b2) and (\u03b1,\u03b2') certifies a unique color (3,\u03b2).\n\n- Lemma R1 (maximal-S bound on local rays). Let U have a unique maximal m=(X,Y). If p=(\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2208Max(S), where S={u\u2208U: u_x<X,u_y<Y}, then r_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)\u22641 and s_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)\u22641.\n  Proof. If there are two distinct points above \u03b2 in column \u03b1 below Y, the lower of them is in S and is NE of p, contradicting p\u2208Max(S). Hence at most one such point below Y exists. A further point at y=Y may exist at (\u03b1,Y), so r_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)\u22641. The argument for s_U is analogous: two distinct points to the right of \u03b1 below X would give a point in S that is E of p (and hence NE once we account for \u03b2 unchanged), contradicting maximality. Thus s_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)\u22641.\n  Why useful: For p\u2208Max(S), the type\u20132 counts r_U(\u03b1,\u03b2), s_U(\u03b1,\u03b2) are each 0 or 1. This sharply restricts how (2,\u03b1,\u03b2) can fail to be unique and localizes the obstruction exclusively to the boundary (top row/right column), aligning with H\u2032 and K.\n\n- Corollary (R1 \u21d2 \u201cboundary-only\u201d obstruction for type 1). With notation as in R1, all NE neighbors of p lie on the top row or right column. Moreover, p has exactly one NE neighbor iff both of the following hold: there is no top-row point strictly to the right of \u03b1 other than m, and there is no right-column point strictly above \u03b2 other than m. This rephrases H\u2032 and gives a checkable certificate for unique type 1 at SW-maxima p.\n\n### Examples to probe and validate the micro-lemmas\n\n- R4 example. U={(2,5),(5,5)}\u222a{(1,1),(3,2),(4,7)}. Row \u03b2=5 has exactly two points at x=2,5. Column \u03b1=2 does not appear in any other row with a right neighbor (there is no (2,\u03b2') with any x>2 in that row). Hence T_4(2)=1; the edge (2,5)\u2013(5,5) is uniquely colored (4,2).\n\n- R3 example (dual). U={(6,2),(6,4)}\u222a{(1,1),(5,3),(7,7)}. Column \u03b1=6 has exactly two points at y=2,4. No other column has a point on row \u03b2=2 with a vertical extension above. So T_3(2)=1; the edge (6,2)\u2013(6,4) is uniquely colored (3,2).\n\n- R1 boundary-only obstruction. U has unique maximal m=(7,7). Let p be (3,3) and assume p\u2208Max(S). Then r_U(3,3), s_U(3,3) \u2208{0,1}. If r_U(3,3)=s_U(3,3)=1 fails, the only reason p can have \u22652 NE neighbors is through top-row/right-column points strictly beyond p. This directs the search to H\u2032/K triggers.\n\n### Ideas toward finishing the unique-maximal case (pivot-or-corner search)\n\n- Goal: Prove that for U with a unique maximal m, one of the following triggers fires: (i) H\u2032 (Theorem 9), (ii) K (Theorem 10), (iii) the column-dual of K in a safe form (Singleton+extension, Theorem 3), or (iv) a robust L-corner (Theorem 7) at some (\u03b1,\u03b2)=(p_x,p_y) for p\u2208Max(S).\n\n- Extremal selection and consequences. Choose p\u2208Max(S) with maximal x and, among those, maximal y. By R1, r_U(p_x,p_y), s_U(p_x,p_y)\u2208{0,1}. There are three stable regimes:\n  \u2022 Regime A: Both are 1 and neither extra boundary point exists beyond m (i.e., H\u2032 holds). Then type\u20131 unique at p.\n  \u2022 Regime B: Exactly one of r or s is 1. Then (2,p_x,p_y) cannot be unique. However, the presence of exactly one vertical (or horizontal) extension at p often promotes a singleton+extension trigger on the corresponding row/column. Concretely, if r=1 and s=0, then column p_x has exactly one point above p_y and\u2014with the choice of p maximal in x and then y\u2014there is strong evidence that row p_y has no right extension other than a possible point at X (which would imply s=1). If additionally column p_x is a singleton at row p_y, Lemma R3 yields a unique type\u20133 color. A symmetric check applies when s=1 and r=0 via Lemma R4.\n  \u2022 Regime C: r=s=0. Then p has no vertical/horizontal extension, hence its NE neighbors, if any, must lie solely on the two boundary sets (top row and right column). If neither K nor the safe column-dual fires, both boundaries must be \u201cpopulated.\u201d In this situation, the nearest top-row point (a,Y) to the right of p and the nearest right-column point (X,b) above p together form, with p, an empty L-corner frame. Choosing a point q on one of the two open segments would contradict p\u2019s maximality (R1). Thus the open segments at p are empty, and (by Theorem 7) (2,p_x,p_y) is unique. I will formalize the \u201cempty segments\u201d deduction next round by a careful nearest-neighbor argument.\n\nWhy useful: This reduces the unique-maximal case to checking finitely many local patterns around a single extremal p, and provides explicit callable triggers in each regime.\n\n### Refinement for maxima pairs (toward |Max(U)|\u22652)\n\n- Observation (consecutive maxima rays are disjoint). With maxima m_i=(x_i,y_i) in x-increasing order, the horizontal rays in row y_{i+1} to the right of x_i (counted by S_i) and the vertical rays in column x_i above y_{i+1} (counted by R_i) are anchored at distinct rows/columns across different i. Thus any global assumption \u201cS_i\u22652 for all i\u201d or \u201cR_i\u22652 for all i\u201d enforces many distinct rows/columns carrying extra extensions. This abundance should force a singleton+extension trigger (Theorem 3) on some row/column or a robust L-corner (Theorem 7) where exactly one extension is present. I will turn this heuristic into a counting lemma: if S_i\u22652 for all i and R_i\u22652 for all i, then there exists \u03b1 or \u03b2 with exactly one extension and a unique base, yielding a type\u20133/4 unique color.\n\n### Next steps (concrete and auditable)\n\n1) Correct the |U|=4 proof in output.md by replacing the faulty type\u20133 subcase with a direct application of Theorem 7 (robust L-corner) at the lower row\u2019s left endpoint. I will write a concise replacement paragraph for the verifier to curate.\n\n2) Formalize the nearest-neighbor \u201cempty L-segments\u201d argument in Regime C for the unique-maximal case to derive Theorem 7 at (p_x,p_y). This will close the remaining subcase under a precise selection of p\u2208Max(S).\n\n3) Develop a counting lemma for |Max(U)|\u22652: if for all i both S_i\u22652 and R_i\u22652, then either a singleton+extension (Theorem 3) occurs or a robust L-corner (Theorem 7) occurs among the set of pairs { (x_i,y_{i+1}) }. The proof will exploit the disjointness of the rows {y_{i+1}} and columns {x_i} across i.\n\n4) Optional small-case stress test: push the verified bound to |U|=5 by pattern analysis using Theorems 2\u20137 and Lemmas R1/R3/R4, identifying any residual subpatterns that still require a bespoke trigger.\n\n### Summary\n- Identified and corrected a flaw in the |U|=4 argument; Theorem 7 (robust L-corner) cleanly resolves the affected subcase (including the 2\u00d72 rectangle).\n- Added safe global triggers R4/R3 (two-on-a-line with globally unique base) and a structural bound R1 on r_U and s_U at SW-maxima in the unique-maximal regime, crystallizing that only boundary points can obstruct type\u20131 uniqueness there.\n- Outlined a tight pivot-or-corner strategy around an extremal p to finish the unique-maximal case, and a plan to convert \u201call consecutive maxima are heavy\u201d into a singleton+extension or L-corner witness.\n"}, {"prover_id": "02", "progress_md": "## Round 0006 \u2014 2025-08-27T19:00:46Z\n\n### Quick audit of output.md (gaps and fixes)\n\n- Gap in Theorem 11 (|U|=4). In the subcase where two distinct rows each have exactly two points and share the same left endpoint \u03b1, the proof claims: \u201cno other column contains a point at row \u03b2,\u201d where \u03b2 is the lower of the two y-values in column \u03b1. This is incorrect: the very row \u03b2 contains a second point to the right (by assumption that row \u03b2 has two points), so there is at least one other column at row \u03b2. The desired uniqueness T_3(\u03b2)=1 must additionally ensure that no other column at row \u03b2 contributes a vertical edge above \u03b2. A correct fix is straightforward:\n  - If the right endpoints on the two rows are distinct (\u03b3_1\u2260\u03b3_2), then at row \u03b2=\u03b2_1, the only column contributing to T_3(\u03b2_1) is \u03b1, so T_3(\u03b2_1)=1 and (3,\u03b2_1) is unique.\n  - If the right endpoints coincide (\u03b3_1=\u03b3_2=\u03b3), then the four points form a full rectangle and (2,\u03b1,\u03b2_1) is unique by r_U(\u03b1,\u03b2_1)=s_U(\u03b1,\u03b2_1)=1 (the robust L-corner/Type\u20132 formula). This corrects the subcase.\n\nNo other issues found this round; Theorems 1\u201310 look solid as stated and proved. Theorem 6\u2019s final bullet (the 3-point permutations) is correct but terse; it is acceptable as a curated fact.\n\n### New, checkable lemmas (unique-maximal case consolidation)\n\nLet U have a unique maximal element m=(X,Y) in the product order, and let S={p\u2208U: p_x<X and p_y<Y}. Write Max(S) for the set of product-order maximal points in S.\n\n- Lemma UM1 (SW-max: boundary-aligned neighbors are the only NE neighbors). Let p=(\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2208Max(S). Then:\n  - There is no q\u2208U with x=\u03b1 and \u03b2<y<Y (else q\u2208S and q\u227bp).\n  - There is no q\u2208U with y=\u03b2 and \u03b1<x<X (else q\u2208S and q\u227dp with x>\u03b1, contradicting p maximal in S).\n  - Consequently, any NE neighbor of p lies on the top row or right column: the only possible NE neighbors are (\u03b1,Y) (if present) and/or (X,\u03b2) (if present), besides m itself.\n  Proof. Immediate from product-order maximality of p and the definitions above.\n  Why useful: Reduces NE-neighbor checks at p\u2208Max(S) to two boundary locations, enabling immediate uniqueness triggers below.\n\n- Lemma UM2 (SW-max + boundary alignment \u21d2 immediate uniqueness). With notation as above and p=(\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2208Max(S):\n  - If both (\u03b1,Y) and (X,\u03b2) lie in U, then r_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)=1 and s_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)=1 by UM1, and the color (2,\u03b1,\u03b2) is unique (Type\u20132 formula).\n  - If exactly one of (\u03b1,Y),(X,\u03b2) lies in U, then p has exactly one NE neighbor, so the color (1,\u03b1,\u03b2) is unique (Type\u20131 formula).\n  Proof. By UM1, no other contributors exist on the relevant column/row; hence r_U,s_U\u2208{0,1} with the stated values, yielding the two cases.\n  Why useful: Gives a complete dichotomy at a single SW-maximal point; as soon as one boundary alignment occurs, we obtain a unique color of type 1 or 2.\n\n- Corollary UM3 (partial resolution of the unique-maximal regime). If S\u2260\u2205 and there exists p\u2208Max(S) for which (\u03b1,Y)\u2208U or (X,\u03b2)\u2208U, then G[U] has a uniquely colored edge (by UM2). If S=\u2205, the configuration is supported on a row\u222acolumn and Lemma 8 (cross-shape) applies. Thus the only unresolved unique-maximal subcase is when S\u2260\u2205 and for every p=(\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2208Max(S), neither (\u03b1,Y) nor (X,\u03b2) lies in U.\n  Why useful: This isolates a small, concrete \u201chard subcase\u201d and shows that most unique-maximal configurations are already settled by existing tools.\n\n### Corrected and streamlined proof for |U|=4 (to replace the flawed subcase)\n\nClaim P4\u2019 (Every |U|=4 has a unique color). The overall structure in Theorem 11 is right; we refine the \u201ctwo 2-point rows with common left endpoint \u03b1\u201d subcase.\n- Suppose U has two distinct rows \u03b2_1<\u03b2_2 with points {(\u03b1,\u03b2_i),(\u03b3_i,\u03b2_i)} for i=1,2 and \u03b3_i>\u03b1. If \u03b3_1\u2260\u03b3_2, then at row \u03b2_1 only column \u03b1 contributes a vertical edge above \u03b2_1 (column \u03b3_1 has no point above \u03b2_1 with only four points total), hence T_3(\u03b2_1)=1 and (3,\u03b2_1) is unique. If \u03b3_1=\u03b3_2=\u03b3, U is the four corners of a rectangle; then r_U(\u03b1,\u03b2_1)=s_U(\u03b1,\u03b2_1)=1 and (2,\u03b1,\u03b2_1) is unique (Theorem 7). All other subcases are handled exactly as in Theorem 11.\n- This closes the gap noted above. (I recommend the verifier updates output.md accordingly.)\n\n### Additional small, robust triggers\n\n- Lemma D\u2032 (explicit consecutive-maxima L-corner). Let M=Max(U) = {(x_i,y_i)} with x_1<\u22ef<x_k and y_1>\u22ef>y_k. If for some i we have no point (x_i,y) with y_{i+1}<y<y_i and no point (x,y_{i+1}) with x_i<x<x_{i+1}, then r_U(x_i,y_{i+1})=s_U(x_i,y_{i+1})=1 and (2,x_i,y_{i+1}) is unique.\n  Proof. Immediate from the Type\u20132 formula; this is the maxima-specialization of Theorem 7.\n  Why useful: A clean, local certificate when scanning consecutive maxima; tolerates arbitrary points elsewhere.\n\n### Examples and checks\n\n- UM2 in action. Let U={(2,2),(2,5),(4,5),(5,3),(5,5)} with unique maximum m=(5,5). S has Max(S) points at (2,2) and (5,3)\u2209S; pick p=(2,2). Both (2,5) and (5,2) exist? Here (5,2) is absent, (2,5) present \u21d2 p has exactly one NE neighbor \u21d2 (1,2,2) is unique by UM2.\n- Correcting Theorem 11 subcase. Take U={(1,1),(3,1),(1,4),(5,4)}: two 2-point rows sharing \u03b1=1, with right endpoints 3 and 5 (distinct). Then T_3(1)=1 via column 1, hence (3,1) unique. If instead U={(1,1),(5,1),(1,4),(5,4)}, we get a rectangle and (2,1,1) unique (r=s=1).\n- Lemma D\u2032 edge case. U with consecutive maxima m_1=(2,7), m_2=(6,3), and no points on (x=2, y\u2208{4,5,6}) nor (y=3, x\u2208{3,4,5}). Then (2,2,3) is unique.\n\n### Obstacles and why some attempts fail\n\n- Completing the unique-maximal case. The unresolved subcase is: S\u2260\u2205 and every p\u2208Max(S) has neither (\u03b1,Y) nor (X,\u03b2) present. UM2 doesn\u2019t fire; Theorem 10 (top-row pivot) might also fail if every non-rightmost top-row column reappears below Y. A na\u00efve \u201ctake the closest p to the corner\u201d can still leave a dominating point at the same y to the right inside S, hence p\u2209Max(S). This shows the need for a careful extremal choice and/or a counting/chain argument over Max(S).\n- Multiple maxima regime. Even when Lemma D\u2032 fails for every adjacent pair (extra points inflate R_i or S_i), those extra points need not directly create a singleton+extension (Types 3/4) without additional constraints. A more global aggregation or an iterative extraction (turn an \u201coffending\u201d point into a boundary singleton) seems necessary.\n\n### Ideas/next steps (auditable)\n\n1) Complete the unique-maximal regime using UM2:\n   - For S\u2260\u2205, either some p\u2208Max(S) is boundary-aligned (UM2 triggers), or none are. In the latter, show that the second-rightmost top-row column \u03b1\u2082 has its highest sub-top-row point q=(\u03b1\u2082,\u03b2) in S and that q\u2208Max(S). If so, (\u03b1\u2082,Y) exists and UM2 fires (contradicting the assumption). The key step is proving q\u2208Max(S). I will formalize: pick \u03b1\u2082 maximal among top-row x\u2019s below X; define \u03b2=max{y<Y : (\u03b1\u2082,y)\u2208U}. Then show there is no r\u2208S with r_x\u2265\u03b1\u2082, r_y\u2265\u03b2 and (r_x,r_y)\u2260(\u03b1\u2082,\u03b2) unless r lies on the right column or top row (which cannot increase both coordinates), yielding the desired maximality.\n\n2) Strengthen maxima-scan via D\u2032: For each i, if D\u2032 fails, record a specific \u201coffender\u201d on column x_i or row y_{i+1}. Try to turn an offender into a singleton+extension trigger:\n   - If there are \u22652 offenders in column x_i (strictly between y_{i+1} and y_i), then on the row of the lower offender, check whether that row is a singleton base with exactly one extension; if yes, Types 3/4 uniqueness fires by Theorem 3.\n   - If not, move to the right to the nearest offender on row y_{i+1} and repeat.

Setup and terminology.
- U ⊆ [n]×[n]. For p=(x,y) and q=(x',y'), say q is NE of p if x'>x and y'>y, and q is SE of p if x'>x and y'<y. Let G[U] be the graph on vertex set U with one edge for every unordered pair {p,q}. Each edge receives one of four types:
  • Type 1 (NE–SW): endpoints differ in both coordinates and one is NE of the other. The color label is (1,α,β) with α = min{x,x'} and β = min{y,y'}; equivalently the SW endpoint’s coordinates.
  • Type 2 (NW–SE): endpoints differ in both coordinates and one is NW of the other. The color label is (2,α,β) with α = min{x,x'} (the NW x) and β = min{y,y'} (the SE y).
  • Type 3 (vertical): same x; the color label is (3,β) where β = min{y,y'} (the lower y).
  • Type 4 (horizontal): same y; the color label is (4,α) where α = min{x,x'} (the left x).

Exact multiplicities (global; now established).
- Type 1: For (α,β)∈U, the multiplicity of color (1,α,β) equals the number of NE neighbors of (α,β) in U. No edge receives label (1,α,β) unless (α,β)∈U.
- Type 2: For any (α,β)∈[n]^2, set r_U(α,β)=# { (α,y)∈U : y>β } and s_U(α,β)=# { (x,β)∈U : x>α }. Then the multiplicity of color (2,α,β) equals r_U(α,β)·s_U(α,β). In particular it is unique iff r_U(α,β)=s_U(α,β)=1.
- Type 3: For any β, the multiplicity of (3,β) equals T_3(β)=∑_α 1_{(α,β)∈U} · # { (α,y)∈U : y>β }. It is unique iff exactly one α contributes and contributes 1.
- Type 4: For any α, the multiplicity of (4,α) equals T_4(α)=∑_β 1_{(α,β)∈U} · # { (x,β)∈U : x>α }. It is unique iff exactly one β contributes and contributes 1.

Safe uniqueness triggers (now established).
- Single-line uniqueness: If U⊆[n]×{y0} with |U|≥2, list its x-coordinates x_1<⋯<x_m. Then the edge between (x_{m−1},y0) and (x_m,y0) is the only edge in G[U] colored (4,x_{m−1}). Dually, if U⊆{x0}×[n] with |U|≥2, then the edge between (x0,y_{m−1}) and (x0,y_m) is the only edge colored (3,y_{m−1}).
- Singleton+extension uniqueness (global): If a row β contains exactly one vertex (α,β) and in column α there is exactly one vertex above it, then (3,β) is unique. Dually, if a column α contains exactly one vertex (α,β) and in row β there is exactly one vertex to its right, then (4,α) is unique. These follow immediately from the type-3/4 formulas.
- Antichain ⇒ unique type 2: If U is an antichain (no two share a row or a column), then ordering its points by increasing x (hence decreasing y), any consecutive pair (x_i,y_i),(x_{i+1},y_{i+1}) yields r_U(x_i,y_{i+1})=s_U(x_i,y_{i+1})=1, hence (2,x_i,y_{i+1}) is unique.
- Clean gap between consecutive maxima: Let M=Max(U) in the product order, list M as (x_1,y_1),…,(x_k,y_k) with x_1<⋯<x_k and y_1>⋯>y_k. For i∈{1,…,k−1} set R_i=# { (x_i,y)∈U : y>y_{i+1} } and S_i=# { (x,y_{i+1})∈U : x>x_i }. If R_i=S_i=1, then the color (2,x_i,y_{i+1}) is unique.
- 2×2 rectangle with clean margins: If U contains the four corners of {(x_1,y_1),(x_1,y_2),(x_2,y_1),(x_2,y_2)} with x_1<x_2, y_1<y_2 and has no other point in column x_1 above y_1 and no other point in row y_1 to the right of x_1, then (2,x_1,y_1) is unique.
- All three-point sets: If |U|=3, then G[U] has a uniquely colored edge. (Full case analysis is recorded in output.)

Corrections and counterexamples.
- “Three or more on a row/column ⇒ unique type 4/3” is false without further global conditions. Counterexample: U = {(1,1),(2,1),(3,1),(2,2),(4,2)}. On row y=1 we get a single occurrence of (4,2) within that row, but globally (4,2) occurs again on row y=2 (edge (2,2)–(4,2)). One must apply the global T_4(α) formula across all rows.
- Gap in “unique maximal ⇒ unique color” (as previously sketched). The subcase S≠∅ must rule out extra NE neighbors lying on the top row or rightmost column. Example showing the gap: U = {(3,3),(4,5),(5,5)}. Here p=(3,3) has two NE neighbors (4,5) and (5,5). A correct proof should either find a different witness (types 3/4 via T_3/T_4) or choose p to avoid such extra NE neighbors. This remains an open item to be fixed.

Open directions.
1) Complete the unique-maximal case rigorously, as outlined above (identify conditions under which T_3/T_4 already gives uniqueness; otherwise find p∈S with unique NE neighbor).
2) For |Max(U)|≥2, either certify a clean gap (R_i=S_i=1) for some consecutive pair, or force a type-3/4 trigger (singleton+extension) or a unique type-1 via a minimality argument on the “extra” points counted by R_i−1 and S_i−1.
3) Extend the small-case verification from |U|=3 to |U|=4 to stress-test the dichotomies and expose the right minimality invariants.
New curated results and corrections (this round)

1) Robust L-corner uniqueness (type 2)
If there exist α<α′ and β<β′ with (α,β′),(α′,β)∈U and, moreover, (i) (α,β) has exactly one point above it in its column (namely (α,β′)) and (ii) exactly one point to its right in its row (namely (α′,β)), then by the type-2 multiplicity formula r_U(α,β)=s_U(α,β)=1 and so the color (2,α,β) is unique. This generalizes the previously noted “2×2 rectangle with clean margins” by not requiring the NE corner (α′,β′) to be present.

2) Cross-shape (row ∪ column) support ⇒ unique color
If U is contained in the union of a single row Y and a single column X and |U|≥2, then G[U] has a uniquely colored edge. Proof: if |U∩row Y|≥2, let α be the second-largest x on that row. Since α≠X, the only row containing (α,·) inside U is Y, and on that row h_Y(α)=1. Thus T_4(α)=1 (unique type 4). Otherwise |U∩column X|≥2 and the vertical analogue gives a unique type 3.

3) Unique-maximal triggers
Let U have a unique maximal m=(X,Y) in the product order. Then X and Y are the global maxima of the used x- and y-coordinates. Define T={x<X : (x,Y)∈U} with α₂=max T (if T≠∅) and R={y<Y : (X,y)∈U} with β₂=max R (if R≠∅). Let S={p∈U : p_x<X and p_y<Y} and let Max(S) denote the set of product-maximal elements of S.
- H′ (SW-max + boundary thresholds ⇒ unique type 1). If S≠∅ and there exists p∈Max(S) with p_x≥α₂ and p_y≥β₂, then p has exactly one NE neighbor in U (namely m), hence the color (1,p_x,p_y) is unique.
- K (top-row pivot ⇒ unique type 4). If T≠∅ and the column α₂ contains no point below Y, then T_4(α₂)=1, realized by the top-row edge between (α₂,Y) and m.
Remark: The column-dual must be formulated with care (see below) to avoid extra contributors in T_3(β₂).

Corrections to proposed lemmas
- The proposed Lemma J (empty L-corner ⇒ unique type 2) was too weak: forbidding points only in the open segments (β,β′) and (α,α′) does not preclude additional points above β′ or to the right of α′. A correct sufficient condition is exactly r_U(α,β)=s_U(α,β)=1 (see robust L-corner above). Counterexample to the weak form: U={(1,2),(3,1),(1,5),(5,1)} satisfies the stated emptiness on (1, y∈(1,2)) and (x∈(1,3),1) but yields multiplicity 4 for color (2,1,1).
- The proposed Lemma K′ (right-column pivot ⇒ unique type 3) as stated omitted the requirement that no other columns contribute to T_3(β₂). A safe version is the singleton+extension trigger: if row β₂ is a singleton (only (X,β₂)) and column X has exactly one point above β₂ (necessarily m in the unique-maximal regime), then T_3(β₂)=1. Counterexample to the weak form: U={(5,5),(5,2),(1,2),(1,4)} makes T_3(2)=2.
- The proposed Lemma L (top/right extremality of consecutive maxima ⇒ unique type 2) is false without excluding intermediate points in column x_i above y_{i+1} (or in row y_{i+1} to the right of x_i). Counterexample: U={(2,5),(5,2),(2,4)} satisfies “m_i topmost” and “m_{i+1} rightmost,” yet r_U(2,2)=2.

Four-point sets (|U|=4)
The claim that every 4-point configuration admits a uniquely colored edge is true; a corrected complete proof is added to output.md. The flawed claim “if no row has 2 points, then no column has 2 points” is refuted by U={(1,1),(1,3),(2,2),(2,4)}. The corrected proof handles all row/column occupancy patterns (4), (3+1), (2+2), (2+1+1), and (1+1+1+1), using type-3/4 triggers or the antichain lemma.

Roadmap for the unique-maximal case
- S=∅ is settled by the cross-shape lemma.
- For S≠∅, aim for a trichotomy: H′ or K (or the safe column-dual) or a robust L-corner (D′) must fire. A workable extremal choice is p∈Max(S) with maximal x and, among those, maximal y; analyze its nearest boundary neighbors and the emptiness of the two open segments above/right of p. If both segments are populated, try to extract a singleton+extension on the boundary or an L-corner between consecutive top-row/right-column supports.

Setup and notation
- U ⊆ [n]×[n]. For p=(x,y) and q=(x',y'), say q is NE of p if x'>x and y'>y, and q is SE of p if x'>x and y'<y. G[U] has an (undirected) edge for every unordered pair {p,q}⊆U, each labeled by one of four types and a color as follows:
  • Type 1 (NE–SW): if one endpoint is NE of the other. Color (1,α,β) with α = min{x,x'} and β = min{y,y'} (coordinates of the SW endpoint).
  • Type 2 (NW–SE): if one endpoint is NW of the other. Color (2,α,β) with α = min{x,x'} (the NW x) and β = min{y,y'} (the SE y).
  • Type 3 (vertical): if x=x'. Color (3,β) with β = min{y,y'} (the lower y).
  • Type 4 (horizontal): if y=y'. Color (4,α) with α = min{x,x'} (the left x).

6) All three-point sets U admit a uniquely colored edge.

Proofs
Theorem 1 (Exact multiplicities).
- Type 1. Fix (α,β)∈[n]^2. An edge has color (1,α,β) iff its SW endpoint is (α,β), hence necessarily (α,β)∈U. Each NE neighbor q of (α,β) produces exactly one edge of that color, and distinct NE neighbors yield distinct edges. Conversely, any edge of that color arises this way. Therefore the multiplicity of (1,α,β) equals the number of NE neighbors of (α,β) in U.
- Type 2. Fix (α,β)∈[n]^2 and define r_U(α,β)=# { (α,y)∈U : y>β } and s_U(α,β)=# { (x,β)∈U : x>α }. Choosing any (α,y) with y>β and any (x,β) with x>α produces a NW–SE pair whose color is (2,α,β); distinct choices yield distinct edges of that color. Conversely, any edge of color (2,α,β) has its NW endpoint on the vertical ray { (α,y) : y>β } and its SE endpoint on the horizontal ray { (x,β) : x>α }. Hence the multiplicity is r_U(α,β)·s_U(α,β). In particular, uniqueness holds iff r_U(α,β)=s_U(α,β)=1.
- Type 3. Fix β. For each α with (α,β)∈U, the lower endpoint (α,β) connects vertically to each (α,y) with y>β, contributing v_α(β)=# { (α,y)∈U : y>β } edges of color (3,β). Summing over α gives the total multiplicity T_3(β)=∑_α 1_{(α,β)∈U}·v_α(β). Uniqueness holds iff exactly one α contributes and v_α(β)=1.
- Type 4. Fix α. For each β with (α,β)∈U, the left endpoint (α,β) connects horizontally to each (x,β) with x>α, contributing h_β(α)=# { (x,β)∈U : x>α } edges of color (4,α). Summing over β gives T_4(α)=∑_β 1_{(α,β)∈U}·h_β(α). Uniqueness holds iff exactly one β contributes and h_β(α)=1.

Theorem 2 (Single-line uniqueness).
- Row case. Suppose U⊆[n]×{y0} and |U|≥2. Let the distinct x-coordinates be x_1<⋯<x_m with m≥2. The only horizontal edges in G[U] are those between (x_i,y0) and (x_j,y0). The multiset of colors on these edges is { (4,x_1) repeated m−1 times, (4,x_2) repeated m−2 times, …, (4,x_{m−1}) once }. In particular, (4,x_{m−1}) occurs exactly once in G[U].
- Column case. The vertical analogue holds by symmetry: if U⊆{x0}×[n] with |U|≥2 and y_1<⋯<y_m, then (3,y_{m−1}) occurs exactly once.

Theorem 3 (Singleton+extension triggers).
- If a row β contains exactly one point (α,β)∈U and in column α there is exactly one point (α,y) with y>β, then by Theorem 1 (type 3) we have T_3(β)=1 and hence the color (3,β) is unique. The column/row dual gives the type-4 trigger.

Theorem 4 (Antichain ⇒ unique type 2).
- Assume U is an antichain (no two share a row or a column). List U as (x_1,y_1),…,(x_m,y_m) in increasing x, which forces y_1>y_2>⋯>y_m. For any i∈{1,…,m−1} consider (α,β)=(x_i,y_{i+1}). In column α there is exactly one point above β, namely (x_i,y_i); in row β there is exactly one point to the right of α, namely (x_{i+1},y_{i+1}). Thus r_U(α,β)=s_U(α,β)=1, and by Theorem 1 (type 2) the color (2,α,β) is unique.

Theorem 5 (Consecutive-maxima clean gap ⇒ unique type 2).
- Let M=Max(U) under the product order, listed as m_i=(x_i,y_i) with x_1<⋯<x_k and y_1>⋯>y_k (k≥2). For i∈{1,…,k−1} define R_i=# { (x_i,y)∈U : y>y_{i+1} } and S_i=# { (x,y_{i+1})∈U : x>x_i }. If R_i=S_i=1, then with (α,β)=(x_i,y_{i+1}) we have r_U(α,β)=R_i and s_U(α,β)=S_i, hence r_U·s_U=1 and color (2,α,β) is unique by Theorem 1 (type 2).

Theorem 6 (All three-point sets admit a uniquely colored edge).
- Let U have three distinct points.
  • If all three lie on a common row, with x_1<x_2<x_3, the three horizontal edges on that row have colors (4,x_1),(4,x_1),(4,x_2), so (4,x_2) is unique.
  • If all three lie on a common column, the vertical analogue yields a unique (3,y_2).
  • Otherwise, if some pair lies on a row (resp. column) but not all three do, the edge of that pair has a type-4 (resp. type-3) color that cannot be duplicated elsewhere in U because there is no second edge on that same row (resp. column).
  • Finally, if all x- and y-coordinates are distinct, order by x: p_1=(x_1,y_1),p_2=(x_2,y_2),p_3=(x_3,y_3).
    – If y_1<y_2<y_3, then p_2p_3 is type 1 with color (1,x_2,y_2) and is unique (its SW endpoint is p_2, which has exactly one NE neighbor, namely p_3).
    – If y_1>y_2>y_3, then p_2p_3 is type 2 with label (2,x_2,y_3) and is unique since r_U(x_2,y_3)=s_U(x_2,y_3)=1.
    – In each of the remaining permutations of (y_1,y_2,y_3), one of the consecutive pairs in x-order forms a type-2 edge (NW–SE) with exactly one point above the L-corner in its column and exactly one point to the right on its row, giving a unique type-2 color by Theorem 1 (type 2). Hence at least one unique color exists in all cases.
Theorem 7 (Robust L-corner uniqueness for type 2).
Let α<α′ and β<β′. Suppose (α,β′),(α′,β)∈U, and in column α there is exactly one point above β (namely (α,β′)), and in row β there is exactly one point to the right of α (namely (α′,β)). Then the color (2,α,β) occurs exactly once in G[U].
Proof. By Theorem 1 (type 2), r_U(α,β)=1 and s_U(α,β)=1, hence the multiplicity r_U·s_U=1.

Theorem 8 (Row ∪ column support ⇒ a unique color).
Assume U⊆({x=X}×[n]) ∪ ([n]×{y=Y}) and |U|≥2. Then G[U] has a uniquely colored edge.
Proof. If U⊆{x=X}×[n] or U⊆[n]×{y=Y}, Theorem 2 applies. Otherwise U meets both the row and the column. If |U∩([n]×{Y})|≥2, list its x-coordinates x_1<⋯<x_m and set α=x_{m−1}. Since α≠X and U⊆(column X)∪(row Y), the only β with (α,β)∈U is β=Y. On row Y, h_Y(α)=1. Hence T_4(α)=1 by Theorem 1 (type 4). If instead |U∩({X}×[n])|≥2, the vertical analogue yields a unique type-3 color.

Theorem 9 (Unique-maximal: SW-max with boundary thresholds ⇒ unique type 1).
Suppose U has a unique maximal element m=(X,Y) in the product order. Let T={x<X : (x,Y)∈U} and R={y<Y : (X,y)∈U}, with α₂=max T if T≠∅ (and α₂=−∞ otherwise), and β₂=max R if R≠∅ (and β₂=−∞ otherwise). Let S={p∈U : p_x<X and p_y<Y}. If S≠∅ and there exists p∈Max(S) (for the product order) with p_x≥α₂ and p_y≥β₂, then the color (1,p_x,p_y) is unique.
Proof. Any NE neighbor q of p with q_x<X and q_y<Y would satisfy q≻p and lie in S, contradicting p∈Max(S). Thus every NE neighbor of p lies on row Y or column X. Because p_x≥α₂, there is no (x,Y)∈U with p_x<x<X, and because p_y≥β₂, there is no (X,y)∈U with p_y<y<Y. Hence the only possible NE neighbor is m. By Theorem 1 (type 1), the multiplicity of (1,p_x,p_y) equals the number of NE neighbors of p, namely 1.

Theorem 10 (Unique-maximal: top-row pivot ⇒ unique type 4).
In the setting of Theorem 9, if T≠∅ and the column α₂ contains no point below Y, then the color (4,α₂) occurs exactly once in G[U].
Proof. On row Y, the point (α₂,Y) has exactly one right neighbor, (X,Y), so h_Y(α₂)=1. For β≠Y there is no (α₂,β)∈U by hypothesis, and there are no β>Y in U when m is the unique maximal. Therefore T_4(α₂)=h_Y(α₂)=1 by Theorem 1 (type 4).

Theorem 11 (Every four-point set admits a uniquely colored edge).
If |U|=4, then G[U] has a uniquely colored edge.
Proof. If some row has ≥3 points, list the x-coordinates on that row as x_1<⋯<x_k with k≥3. The rightmost edge on that row has color (4,x_{k−1}). To realize (4,x_{k−1}) elsewhere would require a different row containing both (x_{k−1},·) and a point with x>x_{k−1}, which is impossible with only one point off the given row. Thus (4,x_{k−1}) is unique. If some column has ≥3 points, the vertical analogue (type 3) applies.
Otherwise, every row and every column has ≤2 points. If there is a row with exactly two points, let its smaller x be α. If no other row contains both (α,·) and a point to its right, then by Theorem 1 (type 4) we have T_4(α)=1. Otherwise there exists a second row with exactly two points and the same left endpoint α, so column α contains exactly two points at distinct y-values y_1≠y_2. Let β=min{y_1,y_2}. In column α there is exactly one point above β, and because rows have ≤2 points and |U|=4, no other column contains a point at row β. Hence T_3(β)=1 and the color (3,β) is unique.
Finally, if no row has two points, then each row has exactly one point. If some column has two points, let β be the lower y on that column; at row β only that column contributes and v(β)=1, so T_3(β)=1. If no column has two points either, U is an antichain, and Theorem 4 gives a unique type-2 color. In all cases a unique color exists.
