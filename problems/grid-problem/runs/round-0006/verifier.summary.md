High-level summary: Both reports correctly identify a real flaw in the |U|=4 proof (Theorem 11) in output.md. The fixes you propose are essentially sound, with two options: (i) replace the problematic Type-3 uniqueness argument by a direct application of the robust L-corner (Type-2) lemma (Theorem 7) at the bottom-left corner, or (ii) split by whether the right endpoints coincide and conclude either Type-3 (if distinct) or Type-2 (if equal). I adopt (i) because it is uniform and simpler. I have updated output.md accordingly by replacing the flawed paragraph with a short, correct application of Theorem 7; see the revised Theorem 11.
