{"feedback_md":"High-level summary: Both reports correctly identify a real flaw in the |U|=4 proof (Theorem 11) in output.md. The fixes you propose are essentially sound, with two options: (i) replace the problematic Type-3 uniqueness argument by a direct application of the robust L-corner (Type-2) lemma (Theorem 7) at the bottom-left corner, or (ii) split by whether the right endpoints coincide and conclude either Type-3 (if distinct) or Type-2 (if equal). I adopt (i) because it is uniform and simpler. I have updated output.md accordingly by replacing the flawed paragraph with a short, correct application of Theorem 7; see the revised Theorem 11.\n\nDetailed audit and critique:\n- Prover 01: The counterexample to the italicized claim in Theorem 11 is valid (2×2 rectangle). Lemmas R3 and R4 (row/column-of-two with globally unique base ⇒ unique Type 4/3) are correct and follow cleanly from the Type-4/3 multiplicity formulas; they are safe “global triggers” worth tracking in notes. However, Lemma R1 as written has a gap: it tries to bound r_U(α,β) and s_U(α,β) by 1 for p∈Max(S) but only argues there cannot be two points strictly below Y/left of X; it does not rule out the presence of one such point plus (α,Y) (or (X,β)), which would make r_U or s_U equal 2. The intended conclusion is salvageable when one notes that for p∈Max(S), there are actually no points with x=α, β<y<Y and no points with y=β, α<x<X; this is precisely what Prover 02’s UM1 states and proves. So please replace R1 by UM1 (or strengthen the argument to show there cannot even be one such point within S).\n- Prover 02: Your correction of the |U|=4 gap is fine, and the rectangle vs. non-rectangle split is correct. Lemma UM1 is crisp, correct, and subsumes the safe part of 01’s R1. Lemma D′ is a clean specialization of Theorem 7 to consecutive maxima and is correct. However, UM2 as stated (“if exactly one of (α,Y) and (X,β) lies in U, then p has exactly one NE neighbor”) is false without additional boundary-cleanliness assumptions. Counterexample: let m=(5,5) be unique maximal; take p=(2,2)∈Max(S); add (3,5),(4,5) on the top row, with neither (2,5) nor (5,2) present. Then p has at least two NE neighbors ((3,5),(4,5)) besides m. The correct “boundary-threshold” condition is essentially Theorem 9: require p_x≥α2 and p_y≥β2 so that no other top-row/right-column NE neighbors exist.\n\nValue triage:\n- Keep: the fix to Theorem 11 (I’ve implemented the Theorem 7-based repair), UM1, D′, and the safe triggers R3/R4. The “pivot-or-corner” plan (maximize x then y among Max(S) and analyze three regimes r,s∈{0,1}) is promising but needs formalization; keep in notes only.\n- Discard/Revise: R1 (replace by UM1); UM2 (strengthen to the α2/β2-threshold form, which is Theorem 9 already in output.md).\n\nNext steps (concrete):\n1) Unique-maximal regime: Formalize the extremal choice p∈Max(S) with maximal x (and then maximal y). Prove rigorously that when r_U(p)=s_U(p)=0, the nearest top-row point to the right and nearest right-column point above cannot exist simultaneously away from m, or else one can extract a robust L-corner (Theorem 7) at p. Write the nearest-neighbor argument explicitly: use UM1 to forbid interior points on p’s row/column inside S, then show any additional boundary points force either Theorem 9/10 or Theorem 7.\n2) Multiple maxima: Turn the “disjointness of rays” heuristic into a counting lemma. If for every consecutive pair (x_i,y_i),(x_{i+1},y_{i+1}) both R_i≥2 and S_i≥2, aggregate over i to force a singleton+extension (Theorem 3) in some row/column or a D′-style robust L-corner. Outline a short pigeonhole-style proof tracking how many distinct rows/columns must carry extensions.\n3) Optional: Push the verified small cases to |U|=5 by row/column occupancy patterns, systematically applying Theorems 2–7, 8–10, UM1, and D′. This will surface any remaining “hard” micro-configurations to target with a final lemma.\n\nI have appended to notes.md: (i) the erratum and fix for Theorem 11, (ii) safe global triggers R3/R4 with proofs, (iii) UM1 with proof, and (iv) a cautionary note refuting UM2, plus the extremal-regime plan and the consecutive-maxima D′ certificate. I have replaced Theorem 11 in output.md with a corrected proof that uses Theorem 7 in the problematic subcase. Verdict: partial success (we fixed a flaw and added solid auxiliary tools).","new_notes_md":"Erratum to Theorem 11 (|U|=4) and fix.\n- The original subcase “two distinct rows each have exactly two points and share the same left endpoint α ⇒ T_3(β)=1 for the lower β” was incorrect. Counterexample: the 2×2 rectangle U={(1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(2,2)} has two columns contributing to T_3(1).\n- Correct resolution: In that subcase, let β be the lower y among the two points in column α. Then row β has exactly two points (α,β),(γ,β) (so s_U(α,β)=1), and column α has exactly one point above β (namely at the higher row, so r_U(α,β)=1). By Theorem 7 (robust L-corner), (2,α,β) is unique. This uniform fix also covers the rectangle case.\n\nSafe global triggers (recorded for use).\n- R4 (row-of-two with globally unique left endpoint ⇒ unique type 4). Suppose some row β has exactly two points (α,β),(α′,β) with α<α′, and for every other row β′ either (α,β′)∉U or there is no point (x,β′) with x>α. Then T_4(α)=1, hence there is a unique color (4,α). Proof: From the type-4 formula, only row β contributes and contributes 1.\n- R3 (column-of-two with globally unique lower endpoint ⇒ unique type 3). Suppose some column α has exactly two points (α,β)<(α,β′) with β<β′, and for every other column α′ either (α′,β)∉U or there is no point (α′,y) with y>β. Then T_3(β)=1, hence there is a unique color (3,β).

Let S={p∈U: p_x<X and p_y<Y} and Max(S) be its product-order maxima.\n- UM1 (boundary-only NE neighbors for SW-maxima). For any p=(α,β)∈Max(S): (i) there is no q∈U with x=α and β<y<Y; (ii) there is no q∈U with y=β and α<x<X. Consequently, any NE neighbor of p lies on the top row y=Y or the right column x=X. Proof: If such a q existed in (i) or (ii), then q∈S and q≻p, contradicting p∈Max(S).\n- Caution: The statement “If exactly one of (α,Y) and (X,β) lies in U, then p has exactly one NE neighbor” is false without further constraints. Counterexample: m=(5,5), p=(2,2)∈Max(S), and top-row points (3,5),(4,5) present while (2,5),(5,2) are absent. Then p has multiple NE neighbors. The correct boundary-threshold uniqueness is Theorem 9: require p_x≥α₂ and p_y≥β₂, where α₂ (resp. β₂) is the largest x<X with (x,Y)∈U (resp. largest y<Y with (X,y)∈U).\n\nMaxima-local L-corner certificate.\n- D′ (explicit consecutive-maxima L-corner). If M=Max(U)={m_i=(x_i,y_i)} with x_1<⋯<x_k and y_1>⋯>y_k and for some i there is no (x_i,y) with y_{i+1}<y<y_i and no (x,y_{i+1}) with x_i<x<x_{i+1}, then r_U(x_i,y_{i+1})=s_U(x_i,y_{i+1})=1 and color (2,x_i,y_{i+1}) is unique.

Fix (α,β)∈[n]^2. An edge has color (1,α,β) iff its SW endpoint is (α,β), hence necessarily (α,β)∈U. Each NE neighbor q of (α,β) produces exactly one edge of that color, and distinct NE neighbors yield distinct edges. Conversely, any edge of that color arises this way. Therefore the multiplicity of (1,α,β) equals the number of NE neighbors of (α,β) in U.\n- Type 2. Fix (α,β)∈[n]^2 and define r_U(α,β)=# { (α,y)∈U : y>β } and s_U(α,β)=# { (x,β)∈U : x>α }. Choosing any (α,y) with y>β and any (x,β) with x>α produces a NW–SE pair whose color is (2,α,β); distinct choices yield distinct edges of that color. Conversely, any edge of color (2,α,β) has its NW endpoint on the vertical ray { (α,y) : y>β } and its SE endpoint on the horizontal ray { (x,β) : x>α }. Hence the multiplicity is r_U(α,β)·s_U(α,β). In particular, uniqueness holds iff r_U(α,β)=s_U(α,β)=1.\n- Type 3. Fix β. For each α with (α,β)∈U, the lower endpoint (α,β) connects vertically to each (α,y) with y>β, contributing v_α(β)=# { (α,y)∈U : y>β } edges of color (3,β). Summing over α gives the total multiplicity T_3(β)=∑_α 1_{(α,β)∈U}·v_α(β). Uniqueness holds iff exactly one α contributes and v_α(β)=1.\n- Type 4. Fix α. For each β with (α,β)∈U, the left endpoint (α,β) connects horizontally to each (x,β) with x>α, contributing h_β(α)=# { (x,β)∈U : x>α } edges of color (4,α). Summing over β gives T_4(α)=∑_β 1_{(α,β)∈U}·h_β(α). Uniqueness holds iff exactly one β contributes and h_β(α)=1.\n\nTheorem 2 (Single-line uniqueness).\n- Row case. Suppose U⊆[n]×{y0} and |U|≥2. Let the distinct x-coordinates be x_1<⋯<x_m with m≥2. The only horizontal edges in G[U] are those between (x_i,y0) and (x_j,y0). The multiset of colors on these edges is { (4,x_1) repeated m−1 times, (4,x_2) repeated m−2 times, …, (4,x_{m−1}) once }. In particular, (4,x_{m−1}) occurs exactly once in G[U].\n- Column case. The vertical analogue holds by symmetry: if U⊆{x0}×[n] with |U|≥2 and y_1<⋯<y_m, then (3,y_{m−1}) occurs exactly once.\n\nTheorem 3 (Singleton+extension triggers).\n- If a row β contains exactly one point (α,β)∈U and in column α there is exactly one point (α,y) with y>β, then by Theorem 1 (type 3) we have T_3(β)=1 and hence the color (3,β) is unique. The column/row dual gives the type-4 trigger.\n\nTheorem 4 (Antichain ⇒ unique type 2).\n- Assume U is an antichain (no two share a row or a column). List U as (x_1,y_1),…,(x_m,y_m) in increasing x, which forces y_1>y_2>⋯>y_m. For any i∈{1,…,m−1} consider (α,β)=(x_i,y_{i+1}). In column α there is exactly one point above β, namely (x_i,y_i); in row β there is exactly one point to the right of α, namely (x_{i+1},y_{i+1}). Thus r_U(α,β)=s_U(α,β)=1, and by Theorem 1 (type 2) the color (2,α,β) is unique.\n\nTheorem 5 (Consecutive-maxima clean gap ⇒ unique type 2).\n- Let M=Max(U) under the product order, listed as m_i=(x_i,y_i) with x_1<⋯<x_k and y_1>⋯>y_k (k≥2). For i∈{1,…,k−1} define R_i=# { (x_i,y)∈U : y>y_{i+1} } and S_i=# { (x,y_{i+1})∈U : x>x_i }. If R_i=S_i=1, then with (α,β)=(x_i,y_{i+1}) we have r_U(α,β)=R_i and s_U(α,β)=S_i, hence r_U·s_U=1 and color (2,α,β) is unique by Theorem 1 (type 2).\n\nTheorem 6 (All three-point sets admit a uniquely colored edge).\n- Let U have three distinct points.\n  • If all three lie on a common row, with x_1<x_2<x_3, the three horizontal edges on that row have colors (4,x_1),(4,x_1),(4,x_2), so (4,x_2) is unique.\n  • If all three lie on a common column, the vertical analogue yields a unique (3,y_2).\n  • Otherwise, if some pair lies on a row (resp. column) but not all three do, the edge of that pair has a type-4 (resp. type-3) color that cannot be duplicated elsewhere in U because there is no second edge on that same row (resp. column).\n  • Finally, if all x- and y-coordinates are distinct, order by x: p_1=(x_1,y_1),p_2=(x_2,y_2),p_3=(x_3,y_3).\n    – If y_1<y_2<y_3, then p_2p_3 is type 1 with color (1,x_2,y_2) and is unique (its SW endpoint is p_2, which has exactly one NE neighbor, namely p_3).\n    – If y_1>y_2>y_3, then p_2p_3 is type 2 with label (2,x_2,y_3) and is unique since r_U(x_2,y_3)=s_U(x_2,y_3)=1.\n    – In each of the remaining permutations of (y_1,y_2,y_3), one of the consecutive pairs in x-order forms a type-2 edge (NW–SE) with exactly one point above the L-corner in its column and exactly one point to the right on its row, giving a unique type-2 color by Theorem 1 (type 2). Hence at least one unique color exists in all cases.\n\nTheorem 7 (Robust L-corner uniqueness for type 2).\nLet α<α′ and β<β′. Suppose (α,β′),(α′,β)∈U, and in column α there is exactly one point above β (namely (α,β′)), and in row β there is exactly one point to the right of α (namely (α′,β)). Then the color (2,α,β) occurs exactly once in G[U].\nProof. By Theorem 1 (type 2), r_U(α,β)=1 and s_U(α,β)=1, hence the multiplicity r_U·s_U=1.\n\nTheorem 8 (Row ∪ column support ⇒ a unique color).\nAssume U⊆({x=X}×[n]) ∪ ([n]×{y=Y}) and |U|≥2. Then G[U] has a uniquely colored edge.\nProof. If U⊆{x=X}×[n] or U⊆[n]×{y=Y}, Theorem 2 applies. Otherwise U meets both the row and the column. If |U∩([n]×{Y})|≥2, list its x-coordinates x_1<⋯<x_m and set α=x_{m−1}. Since α≠X and U⊆(column X)∪(row Y), the only β with (α,β)∈U is β=Y. On row Y, h_Y(α)=1. Hence T_4(α)=1 by Theorem 1 (type 4). If instead |U∩({X}×[n])|≥2, the vertical analogue yields a unique type-3 color.\n\nTheorem 9 (Unique-maximal: SW-max with boundary thresholds ⇒ unique type 1).\nSuppose U has a unique maximal element m=(X,Y) in the product order. Let T={x<X : (x,Y)∈U} and R={y<Y : (X,y)∈U}, with α₂=max T if T≠∅ (and α₂=−∞ otherwise), and β₂=max R if R≠∅ (and β₂=−∞ otherwise). Let S={p∈U : p_x<X and p_y<Y}. If S≠∅ and there exists p∈Max(S) (for the product order) with p_x≥α₂ and p_y≥β₂, then the color (1,p_x,p_y) is unique.\nProof. Any NE neighbor q of p with q_x<X and q_y<Y would satisfy q≻p and lie in S, contradicting p∈Max(S). Thus every NE neighbor of p lies on row Y or column X. Because p_x≥α₂, there is no (x,Y)∈U with p_x<x<X, and because p_y≥β₂, there is no (X,y)∈U with p_y<y<Y. Hence the only possible NE neighbor is m. By Theorem 1 (type 1), the multiplicity of (1,p_x,p_y) equals the number of NE neighbors of p, namely 1.\n\nTheorem 10 (Unique-maximal: top-row pivot ⇒ unique type 4).\nIn the setting of Theorem 9, if T≠∅ and the column α₂ contains no point below Y, then the color (4,α₂) occurs exactly once in G[U].\nProof. On row Y, the point (α₂,Y) has exactly one right neighbor, (X,Y), so h_Y(α₂)=1. For β≠Y there is no (α₂,β)∈U by hypothesis, and there are no β>Y in U when m is the unique maximal. Therefore T_4(α₂)=h_Y(α₂)=1 by Theorem 1 (type 4).\n\nTheorem 11 (Every four-point set admits a uniquely colored edge).\nIf |U|=4, then G[U] has a uniquely colored edge.\nProof. If some row has ≥3 points, list the x-coordinates on that row as x_1<⋯<x_k with k≥3. The rightmost edge on that row has color (4,x_{k−1}). To realize (4,x_{k−1}) elsewhere would require a different row containing both (x_{k−1},·) and a point with x>x_{k−1}, which is impossible with only one point off the given row. Thus (4,x_{k−1}) is unique. If some column has ≥3 points, the vertical analogue (type 3) applies.\nOtherwise, every row and every column has ≤2 points. If there is a row with exactly two points, let its smaller x be α. If no other row contains both (α,·) and a point to its right, then by Theorem 1 (type 4) we have T_4(α)=1. Otherwise there exists a second row with exactly two points and the same left endpoint α. Let β be the lower of the two y-values in column α. Then on row β there is exactly one point to the right of α, and in column α there is exactly one point above β. By Theorem 7 (robust L-corner), r_U(α,β)=s_U(α,β)=1 and the color (2,α,β) is unique.\nFinally, if no row has two points, then each row has exactly one point. If some column has two points, let β be the lower y on that column; at row β only that column contributes and v(β)=1, so T_3(β)=1. If no column has two points either, U is an antichain, and Theorem 4 gives a unique type-2 color. In all cases a unique color exists.\n","new_outputs_append":"False","verdict":"partial success"}
