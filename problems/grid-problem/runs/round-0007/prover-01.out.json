  "progress_md": "### Audit of output.md (gaps, clarifications)\n- Theorem 11 (|U|=4) now looks correct after the fix using Theorem 7 (robust L-corner). I rechecked the subcases; no further issues found.\n- Theorem 10 (unique-maximal: top-row pivot) implicitly uses the fact that in the unique-maximal regime there is no point with y>Y or x>X. This is true but not explicitly stated; I recommend curating the following simple observation (O1) so the proof does not rely on an unstated fact.\n- Theorem 9 (SW-max with boundary thresholds \u21d2 unique type 1) conceptually relies on the fact that for p\u2208Max(S) there are no points of U on the open vertical/horizontal segments above/right of p within S. This is used implicitly; I state it cleanly as Lemma UM1 below for curation.\n\n### New, rigorously stated lemmas ready to curate (with proofs)\n\nObservation O1 (unique maximal \u21d2 coordinatewise maxima).\nStatement. If U has a unique maximal element m=(X,Y) in the product order, then X = max{x : (x,\u00b7)\u2208U} and Y = max{y : (\u00b7,y)\u2208U}.\nProof. If some u=(x',y') has x'>X, then no v\u2208U satisfies v_x\u2265x' and v_y\u2265y' with at least one strict inequality (none can have x\u2265x'>X), so u is maximal too, contradicting uniqueness. The argument for y'>Y is symmetric. \u220e\nWhy useful. Makes explicit a fact used in Theorem 10 and elsewhere.\n\nLemma UM1 (SW-maxima have no interior points on their column/row).\nSetup. Let U have a unique maximal m=(X,Y). Let S={p\u2208U : p_x<X and p_y<Y} and Max(S) its product-order maximal elements.\nStatement. If p=(\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2208Max(S), then (i) there is no q\u2208U with x=\u03b1 and \u03b2<y<Y; (ii) there is no q\u2208U with y=\u03b2 and \u03b1<x<X. Consequently every NE neighbor of p lies on the top row y=Y or the right column x=X.\nProof. If q=(\u03b1,y) with \u03b2<y<Y existed, then q\u2208S and q\u227bp, contradicting p\u2208Max(S). The horizontal case is identical. The consequence follows immediately. \u220e\nWhy useful. This isolates exactly where extra NE neighbors of p can come from, underpinning Theorem 9.\n\nLemma D\u2032 (consecutive-maxima robust L-corner; specialization of Theorem 7).\nSetup. Let M=Max(U) be listed as m_i=(x_i,y_i) with x_1<\u22ef<x_k and y_1>\u22ef>y_k (k\u22652).\nStatement. If for some i we have no point (x_i,y) with y_{i+1}<y<y_i and no point (x,y_{i+1}) with x_i<x<x_{i+1}, then the color (2,x_i,y_{i+1}) is unique in G[U].\nProof. The two emptiness conditions give r_U(x_i,y_{i+1})=1 (only (x_i,y_i) lies above) and s_U(x_i,y_{i+1})=1 (only (x_{i+1},y_{i+1}) lies to the right). By the type\u20132 multiplicity formula, the multiplicity is 1. \u220e\nWhy useful. A clean, local certificate when scanning consecutive maxima.\n\nLemma R4 (row-of-two with globally unique left base \u21d2 unique type 4).\nStatement. Suppose there exists a row \u03b2 with exactly two points (\u03b1,\u03b2),(\u03b1',\u03b2) with \u03b1<\u03b1\u2032. Assume furthermore that for every \u03b2'\u2260\u03b2 we have either (\u03b1,\u03b2')\u2209U or there is no point (x,\u03b2') with x>\u03b1. Then color (4,\u03b1) appears exactly once in G[U].\nProof. By the type\u20134 formula, T_4(\u03b1)=\u2211_{\u03b2''} 1_{(\u03b1,\u03b2'')}\u00b7h_{\u03b2''}(\u03b1). Only \u03b2 contributes (exactly one right neighbor), and it contributes h_\u03b2(\u03b1)=1. All other rows contribute 0 by assumption. Hence T_4(\u03b1)=1. \u220e\n\nLemma R3 (column-of-two with globally unique lower base \u21d2 unique type 3; dual of R4).\nStatement. Suppose there exists a column \u03b1 with exactly two points (\u03b1,\u03b2),(\u03b1,\u03b2') with \u03b2<\u03b2\u2032. Assume furthermore that for every \u03b1'\u2260\u03b1 we have either (\u03b1',\u03b2)\u2209U or there is no point (\u03b1',y) with y>\u03b2. Then color (3,\u03b2) appears exactly once in G[U].\nProof. By the type\u20133 formula, T_3(\u03b2)=\u2211_{\u03b1''} 1_{(\u03b1'',\u03b2)}\u00b7v_{\u03b1''}(\u03b2). Only \u03b1 contributes (exactly one point above), and it contributes v_\u03b1(\u03b2)=1. All other columns contribute 0 by assumption. Hence T_3(\u03b2)=1. \u220e\n\n### Why these help and how to use them\n- O1 and UM1 close implicit gaps in the unique-maximal arguments and can be cited directly in Theorems 9\u201310.\n- D\u2032 adds a robust, easy-to-check certificate when scanning consecutive maxima; it is a direct specialization of Theorem 7 that many configurations satisfy.\n- R3 and R4 are globally safe \u201csingleton+extension\u201d style triggers when a 2-point row/column has a left/lower base that does not act as a base elsewhere; they follow immediately from the multiplicity formulas and are useful in small-case analyses and in pruning \u201coffender\u201d configurations when consecutive-maxima witnesses fail.\n\n### Examples (sanity checks)\n- UM1 in action. U={ (2,2),(2,5),(4,5),(6,3),(6,6) } with unique maximal m=(6,6). Then S contains p=(2,2) and p is in Max(S). UM1 forbids any (2,y) with y\u2208{3,4} and any (x,2) with x\u2208{3,4,5}. Indeed, p\u2019s NE neighbors can only lie on row 5 or column 6.\n- D\u2032 witness. U has consecutive maxima m_1=(3,8), m_2=(7,4); suppose there is no point (3,y) with y\u2208{5,6,7} and no point (x,4) with x\u2208{4,5,6}. Then (2,3,4) is unique.\n- R4 witness. U contains row y=5 points at x=2 and 6, and no other row contains an (x=2,\u00b7) with any right neighbor. Then T_4(2)=1 and (4,2) is unique.\n\n### Ideas toward the remaining hard cases (precise statements to be proved next)\n- Unique-maximal, S\u2260\u2205: pivot-or-corner fixpoint. Choose p\u2208Max(S) with maximal x and then maximal y. By UM1, any NE neighbor of p lies on the top row or right column. There are three regimes to analyze:\n  1) Both (\u03b1:=p_x,Y) and (X,\u03b2:=p_y) lie in U. Then (2,\u03b1,\u03b2) is unique immediately (r=s=1 by UM1 and Theorem 1).\n  2) Exactly one of these lies in U. If, in addition, p_x\u2265\u03b1\u2082 and p_y\u2265\u03b2\u2082 (nearest-boundary thresholds), Theorem 9 gives a unique type\u20131 color. Otherwise, the very boundary points preventing Theorem 9 (extra top-row points right of p_x or extra right-column points above p_y) can potentially be harvested into a D\u2032-style L-corner or an R3/R4 singleton+extension. I will formalize a short \u201cnearest-neighbor\u201d lemma that either produces (2,\u03b1',\u03b2') unique at the first boundary intersection, or isolates a row/column satisfying R3/R4.\n  3) Neither (\u03b1,Y) nor (X,\u03b2) lies in U. Consider the nearest top-row point a=(\u03b1*,Y) with \u03b1*>\u03b1 (if any) and the nearest right-column point b=(X,\u03b2*) with \u03b2*>\u03b2 (if any). If both exist, UM1 ensures the open segments above/right of p on column \u03b1 and row \u03b2 are empty; a and b, together with p, then form the frame of a robust L-corner at (\u03b1,\u03b2). This yields a unique type\u20132 color by Theorem 7. Otherwise, if only one exists, we are back in (2) with potentially a unique type\u20131 via Theorem 9. I will write this carefully next round (checking the emptiness claim and handling the cases when multiple boundary points exist).\n\n- Multiple maxima (|Max(U)|\u22652). For each adjacent pair we either certify uniqueness by D\u2032 or record an \u201coffender\u201d in its column or row (an extra point inflating R_i or S_i). Offenders for different i live on disjoint rows/columns ({y_{i+1}} and {x_i} are all distinct). A pigeonhole/counting lemma should force that some offender actually creates a singleton+extension (R3/R4) or itself forms part of a D\u2032 witness. I will formalize:\n  \u2022 Counting Lemma (to prove): If for all i either R_i\u22652 or S_i\u22652 and no D\u2032-witness exists, then there is \u03b1 with exactly one row \u03b2 having (\u03b1,\u03b2) and exactly one right neighbor (hence T_4(\u03b1)=1), or dually a \u03b2 with exactly one column \u03b1 having (\u03b1,\u03b2) and exactly one upper neighbor (T_3(\u03b2)=1).\n\n### Next steps (concrete, auditable)\n1) Curate O1, UM1, D\u2032, R3, and R4 into output.md; these are safe and strengthen the toolset used by Theorems 9\u201311.\n2) Write and verify the \u201cnearest-boundary lemma\u201d in the unique-maximal regime: with p\u2208Max(S) chosen extremally, show that if Theorem 9 fails then either a D\u2032/Theorem 7 witness exists at (p_x,\u03b2*) or (\u03b1*,p_y), or a singleton+extension (R3/R4) fires on the boundary row/column.\n3) Prove the counting lemma for multiple maxima by aggregating offenders on the disjoint families of rows {y_{i+1}} and columns {x_i} and extracting an R3/R4 or D\u2032 trigger. Validate on dense staircase-like examples.\n\n### Summary of progress this round\n- No new gaps in output.md beyond a suggestion to add O1 and UM1 explicitly. The |U|=4 proof is now sound.\n- Added four rigorous, reusable lemmas (O1, UM1, D\u2032, R3/R4) with proofs, strengthening the unique-maximal and multiple-maxima toolkits.\n- Outlined precise, checkable next steps to finish the unique-maximal case (via a nearest-boundary analysis) and to handle the \u201call consecutive maxima heavy\u201d regime via a counting lemma."
