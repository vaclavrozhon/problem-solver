  "progress_md": "Round 0007 \u2014 incremental, auditable progress\n\nOverview\n- I audited the current output.md. I found no new logical flaws since the last correction to Theorem 11 (|U|=4). Theorem 9 (unique\u2013maximal threshold \u21d2 unique type 1) and Theorem 10 (top-row pivot \u21d2 unique type 4) are correctly stated and proved. The dual \u201cright-column pivot \u21d2 unique type 3\u201d is intentionally not present in symmetric form (as noted in notes.md) because it needs a singleton-row hypothesis; Theorem 3 already supplies the safe version. Below I consolidate the unique\u2013maximal case by formalizing two threshold-existence lemmas, extract a corollary for the search strategy, and add a robust L-corner variant useful in 2+2(+\u2026) configurations.\n\nGaps or cautions in output.md\n- None needing immediate correction. A cautionary note: the dual of Theorem 10 must remain in the singleton-row form (Theorem 3); there is no safe global dual without that assumption (see the counterexample recorded in notes.md).\n\nNew lemmas (rigorous; to be curated)\n\nLemma UM\u2013X (x-threshold existence under unique maximality).\n- Setting. U has a unique maximal m=(X,Y). Let T={x<X : (x,Y)\u2208U} and S={p\u2208U : p_x<X and p_y<Y}. If S\u2260\u2205 and T\u2260\u2205, define \u03b1\u2082=max T.\n- Claim. Either (i) column \u03b1\u2082 contains no point below Y, in which case Theorem 10 yields a unique type\u20134 color; or (ii) there exists p\u2208Max(S) with p_x\u2265\u03b1\u2082.\n- Proof. If column \u03b1\u2082 has no point below Y we are in (i). Otherwise pick q=(\u03b1\u2082,\u03b2) with \u03b2<Y; then q\u2208S. In any finite poset, every element is dominated by some maximal element, so there is p\u2208Max(S) with p\u227dq, hence p_x\u2265\u03b1\u2082. \u220e\n- Why useful. This guarantees that when the top-row pivot (Theorem 10) does not fire, there is a SW-maximal point whose x-coordinate is at least the second-rightmost top-row x, providing half of the threshold for Theorem 9.\n\nLemma UM\u2013Y (y-threshold existence via the safe column pivot).\n- Setting. U has a unique maximal m=(X,Y). Let R={y<Y : (X,y)\u2208U} and S as above. If S\u2260\u2205 and R\u2260\u2205, define \u03b2\u2082=max R.\n- Claim. Either (i) row \u03b2\u2082 is a singleton (only (X,\u03b2\u2082)\u2208U), and then Theorem 3 yields a unique type\u20133 color; or (ii) there exists q\u2208Max(S) with q_y\u2265\u03b2\u2082.\n- Proof. If row \u03b2\u2082 has only (X,\u03b2\u2082), then on column X there is exactly one point above (necessarily m), hence Theorem 3 applies. Otherwise pick r=(\u03b1,\u03b2\u2082) with \u03b1<X; then r\u2208S. As above, some q\u2208Max(S) satisfies q\u227dr, hence q_y\u2265\u03b2\u2082. \u220e\n- Why useful. This supplies the y-threshold needed for Theorem 9 whenever the safe type\u20133 pivot does not already resolve the instance.\n\nCorollary (two-threshold reduction for unique\u2013maximal).\n- With m, T, R, \u03b1\u2082, \u03b2\u2082 as above. If S=\u2205, Theorem 8 (row\u222acolumn support) applies. If S\u2260\u2205, then:\n  \u2022 If T\u2260\u2205 and the top-row pivot (Theorem 10) fails, there is p_x\u2265\u03b1\u2082 for some p\u2208Max(S).\n  \u2022 If R\u2260\u2205 and the singleton-row pivot (Theorem 3) fails, there is q_y\u2265\u03b2\u2082 for some q\u2208Max(S).\n  \u2022 If there exists r\u2208Max(S) with r_x\u2265\u03b1\u2082 and r_y\u2265\u03b2\u2082 simultaneously, Theorem 9 applies and yields a unique type\u20131 color.\n- Interpretation. In the unique-maximal regime, unless a pivot (Theorem 10 or Theorem 3) already certifies uniqueness, we can find one (or two) SW-maximal points meeting the respective x- or y-threshold(s). The remaining unresolved subcase is when x- and y-thresholds are each met but not by the same maximal point. The next step is to convert this \u201ccrossing\u201d into a type\u20132 or type\u20133/4 certificate (see Next steps).\n\nA robust L-corner variant for 2+2(+\u2026)\n\nLemma RL (two 2-point rows sharing a left endpoint, with clean column, \u21d2 unique type 2).\n- Statement. Suppose there exist two distinct rows \u03b2_1<\u03b2_2 such that: (\u03b1,\u03b2_i),(\u03b3_i,\u03b2_i)\u2208U with \u03b1<\u03b3_i (i=1,2); column \u03b1 contains exactly these two points (\u03b1,\u03b2_1),(\u03b1,\u03b2_2); and on the lower row \u03b2:=\u03b2_1 there is exactly one point to the right of \u03b1 (namely (\u03b3_1,\u03b2)). Then color (2,\u03b1,\u03b2) is unique.\n- Proof. By the hypotheses, in column \u03b1 there is exactly one point above \u03b2 (namely (\u03b1,\u03b2_2)), so r_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)=1; in row \u03b2 there is exactly one point to the right of \u03b1 (namely (\u03b3_1,\u03b2)), so s_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)=1. Theorem 1 (type 2) gives uniqueness of (2,\u03b1,\u03b2). \u220e\n- Why useful. This is a safe, verifiable pattern extending the 4-point rectangle subcase to ambient configurations with many other points, provided column \u03b1 stays clean and the lower row has exactly one extension to the right at \u03b1. It is a robust tool within the \u201ctwo heavy rows\u201d regime.\n\nExamples (sanity checks and edge cases)\n- UM\u2013X in action. U={ (6,8) }\u222a{ (3,8),(5,8) }\u222a{ (5,4),(2,1) }. Here m=(6,8), T={3,5}, \u03b1\u2082=5. Column 5 has (5,4), so the top-row pivot fails. Lemma UM\u2013X yields a p\u2208Max(S) with p_x\u22655; indeed p=(5,4)\u2208Max(S).\n- UM\u2013Y in action. U={ (8,6) }\u222a{ (8,3),(8,5) }\u222a{ (4,5),(2,2) }. Here m=(8,6), R={3,5}, \u03b2\u2082=5. Row 5 is not a singleton, so the safe type\u20133 pivot fails; Lemma UM\u2013Y produces q\u2208Max(S) with q_y\u22655; indeed q=(4,5).\n- RL example. Let U contain rows \u03b2_1=1 and \u03b2_2=4 with points (2,1),(7,1) and (2,4),(5,4); no other point in column 2. Then (2,2,1) is unique regardless of extra points elsewhere (provided column 2 remains clean and the lower row remains with exactly one right neighbor at 2).\n\nIdeas toward closing the remaining unique\u2013maximal subcase\n- Structure. Let Max(S)={s_1,\u2026,s_k} with x increasing and y decreasing. Under the corollary above, if both T and R are nonempty and neither pivot fires, there exist indices f,g with x(s_f)\u2265\u03b1\u2082 and y(s_g)\u2265\u03b2\u2082. If some s_i satisfies both, Theorem 9 finishes. Otherwise f>g, so s_g is \u201chigh-but-left\u201d and s_{g+1} is \u201cright-but-low.\u201d This crossing suggests examining the L-corner (x(s_g), y(s_{g+1})). \n- Goal. Prove a dichotomy for this crossing pair: either the L-corner at (x(s_g), y(s_{g+1})) is clean in the sense of Theorem 7 (yielding a unique type\u20132 color), or one of the \u201coffending\u201d extra points that would inflate r_U or s_U promotes a singleton+extension (Theorem 3) or a row-of-two global trigger (R4) on some row/column. The technical task is to pin down a nearest-neighbor variant that ensures any additional contributor on the vertical (resp. horizontal) segment forces one of the safe type\u20133/4 triggers.\n- Plan. For the vertical ray at x(s_g), pick the lowest y\u2032>y(s_{g+1}) with (x(s_g),y\u2032)\u2208U (this is either y\u2032=y(s_g) or the nearest interloper). If y\u2032\u2260y(s_g), then s_g remains maximal but row y\u2032 is an \u201coffender\u201d below Y. We will analyze whether row y\u2032 is singleton (Theorem 3), forms a 2-point row with globally unique left endpoint (R4), or can be paired with a clean column to create an RL-type L-corner. A symmetric analysis applies to the horizontal ray from (x(s_g), y(s_{g+1})).\n\nObstacles and why some direct attempts fail\n- A tempting but false shortcut is to assume that the first crossing pair (s_g,s_{g+1}) automatically yields r_U=s_U=1 at (x(s_g), y(s_{g+1})). This fails because additional points on the vertical segment x=x(s_g) with y\u2208(y(s_{g+1}),y(s_g)) are compatible with s_g being maximal yet increase r_U. Hence additional structure (nearest-neighbor selection plus type\u20133/4 triggers) is needed.\n\nNext steps (concrete and checkable)\n1) Formalize the \u201cnearest-neighbor offender \u21d2 type\u20133/4 trigger\u201d argument sketched above for the crossing pair (s_g,s_{g+1}). The desired lemma: among the lowest vertical/horizontal interlopers at a crossing, at least one induces a singleton+extension (Theorem 3) or a row-of-two with a globally unique base (R4), hence a unique type\u20133/4 color.\n2) Package UM\u2013X, UM\u2013Y, and the crossing analysis into a complete proof of \u201cunique maximal \u21d2 unique color,\u201d yielding a new theorem to curate.\n3) Extend RL to a symmetric \u201cclean-row\u201d variant (two 2-point columns sharing a lower endpoint with a clean row \u21d2 unique type 2) and add these as safe triggers to the library.\n4) Stress-test on crafted worst-case \u201cstaircase with fillers\u201d examples to validate the nearest-neighbor lemma and to calibrate the cleanliness conditions needed for Theorem 7 vs. type\u20133/4 triggers.\n\nWhy this is progress\n- UM\u2013X and UM\u2013Y convert the abstract unique\u2013maximal regime into a finite, verifiable checklist of pivots and thresholds, isolating the only remaining hard subcase (crossing without a single maximal hitting both thresholds). The RL lemma strengthens our catalog of robust, local uniqueness certificates applicable amidst additional points. The next-step plan is precise: prove a nearest-neighbor lemma at the crossing to finish the unique\u2013maximal case."
