  "summary_md": "Two provers advanced the proof toolkit for the \u201cunique color\u201d goal. Prover-01 added rigorous local lemmas: O1 (unique maximal \u21d2 coordinatewise maxima), UM1 (SW-maxima have empty interior on their column/row), D\u2032 (consecutive-maxima L-corner specialization of Theorem 7), and R3/R4 (singleton+extension triggers for columns/rows with two points). Prover-02 built threshold machinery for the unique-maximal regime: UM\u2013X and UM\u2013Y (guarantee an SW-maximal meeting x- or y-threshold unless a pivot resolves the instance), a two-threshold corollary reducing cases, and RL (robust L-corner for two 2-point rows). Both provers sketched the remaining strategy: handle the \u201ccrossing\u201d subcase via nearest-neighbor/nearest-boundary lemmas to produce either a type\u20132 L-corner or a type\u20133/4 singleton trigger, and prove a counting lemma that, when D\u2032 fails across consecutive maxima, forces an R3/R4 or D\u2032 witness. Verifier: partial success. Next concrete tasks: formalize the nearest-neighbor offender \u21d2 type\u20133/4 lemma, prove the counting lemma for multiple maxima, and curate the new lemmas into output.md.

    "Formalize and prove the nearest-neighbor / nearest-boundary lemma that for a crossing pair (s_g,s_{g+1}) either produces a clean L-corner (Theorem 7/D\u2032) or forces a singleton+extension (Theorem 3) or row-of-two trigger (R4).",
    "Prove the counting lemma: if every consecutive-maxima pair fails D\u2032 by having extra points (R_i\u22652 or S_i\u22652), then some column/row yields an R3/R4 singleton+extension (or a D\u2032 witness) \u2014 make the pigeonhole argument precise.",
