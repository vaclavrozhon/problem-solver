### Audit of output.md (gaps, clarifications)
- Theorem 11 (|U|=4) now looks correct after the fix using Theorem 7 (robust L-corner). I rechecked the subcases; no further issues found.
- Theorem 10 (unique-maximal: top-row pivot) implicitly uses the fact that in the unique-maximal regime there is no point with y>Y or x>X. This is true but not explicitly stated; I recommend curating the following simple observation (O1) so the proof does not rely on an unstated fact.
- Theorem 9 (SW-max with boundary thresholds ⇒ unique type 1) conceptually relies on the fact that for p∈Max(S) there are no points of U on the open vertical/horizontal segments above/right of p within S. This is used implicitly; I state it cleanly as Lemma UM1 below for curation.

### New, rigorously stated lemmas ready to curate (with proofs)

Observation O1 (unique maximal ⇒ coordinatewise maxima).
Statement. If U has a unique maximal element m=(X,Y) in the product order, then X = max{x : (x,·)∈U} and Y = max{y : (·,y)∈U}.
Proof. If some u=(x',y') has x'>X, then no v∈U satisfies v_x≥x' and v_y≥y' with at least one strict inequality (none can have x≥x'>X), so u is maximal too, contradicting uniqueness. The argument for y'>Y is symmetric. ∎
Why useful. Makes explicit a fact used in Theorem 10 and elsewhere.

Lemma UM1 (SW-maxima have no interior points on their column/row).
Setup. Let U have a unique maximal m=(X,Y). Let S={p∈U : p_x<X and p_y<Y} and Max(S) its product-order maximal elements.
Statement. If p=(α,β)∈Max(S), then (i) there is no q∈U with x=α and β<y<Y; (ii) there is no q∈U with y=β and α<x<X. Consequently every NE neighbor of p lies on the top row y=Y or the right column x=X.
Proof. If q=(α,y) with β<y<Y existed, then q∈S and q≻p, contradicting p∈Max(S). The horizontal case is identical. The consequence follows immediately. ∎
Why useful. This isolates exactly where extra NE neighbors of p can come from, underpinning Theorem 9.

Lemma D′ (consecutive-maxima robust L-corner; specialization of Theorem 7).
Setup. Let M=Max(U) be listed as m_i=(x_i,y_i) with x_1<⋯<x_k and y_1>⋯>y_k (k≥2).
Statement. If for some i we have no point (x_i,y) with y_{i+1}<y<y_i and no point (x,y_{i+1}) with x_i<x<x_{i+1}, then the color (2,x_i,y_{i+1}) is unique in G[U].
Proof. The two emptiness conditions give r_U(x_i,y_{i+1})=1 (only (x_i,y_i) lies above) and s_U(x_i,y_{i+1})=1 (only (x_{i+1},y_{i+1}) lies to the right). By the type–2 multiplicity formula, the multiplicity is 1. ∎
Why useful. A clean, local certificate when scanning consecutive maxima.

Lemma R4 (row-of-two with globally unique left base ⇒ unique type 4).
Statement. Suppose there exists a row β with exactly two points (α,β),(α',β) with α<α′. Assume furthermore that for every β'≠β we have either (α,β')∉U or there is no point (x,β') with x>α. Then color (4,α) appears exactly once in G[U].
Proof. By the type–4 formula, T_4(α)=∑_{β''} 1_{(α,β'')}·h_{β''}(α). Only β contributes (exactly one right neighbor), and it contributes h_β(α)=1. All other rows contribute 0 by assumption. Hence T_4(α)=1. ∎

Lemma R3 (column-of-two with globally unique lower base ⇒ unique type 3; dual of R4).
Statement. Suppose there exists a column α with exactly two points (α,β),(α,β') with β<β′. Assume furthermore that for every α'≠α we have either (α',β)∉U or there is no point (α',y) with y>β. Then color (3,β) appears exactly once in G[U].
Proof. By the type–3 formula, T_3(β)=∑_{α''} 1_{(α'',β)}·v_{α''}(β). Only α contributes (exactly one point above), and it contributes v_α(β)=1. All other columns contribute 0 by assumption. Hence T_3(β)=1. ∎

### Why these help and how to use them
- O1 and UM1 close implicit gaps in the unique-maximal arguments and can be cited directly in Theorems 9–10.
- D′ adds a robust, easy-to-check certificate when scanning consecutive maxima; it is a direct specialization of Theorem 7 that many configurations satisfy.
- R3 and R4 are globally safe “singleton+extension” style triggers when a 2-point row/column has a left/lower base that does not act as a base elsewhere; they follow immediately from the multiplicity formulas and are useful in small-case analyses and in pruning “offender” configurations when consecutive-maxima witnesses fail.

### Examples (sanity checks)
- UM1 in action. U={ (2,2),(2,5),(4,5),(6,3),(6,6) } with unique maximal m=(6,6). Then S contains p=(2,2) and p is in Max(S). UM1 forbids any (2,y) with y∈{3,4} and any (x,2) with x∈{3,4,5}. Indeed, p’s NE neighbors can only lie on row 5 or column 6.
- D′ witness. U has consecutive maxima m_1=(3,8), m_2=(7,4); suppose there is no point (3,y) with y∈{5,6,7} and no point (x,4) with x∈{4,5,6}. Then (2,3,4) is unique.
- R4 witness. U contains row y=5 points at x=2 and 6, and no other row contains an (x=2,·) with any right neighbor. Then T_4(2)=1 and (4,2) is unique.

### Ideas toward the remaining hard cases (precise statements to be proved next)
- Unique-maximal, S≠∅: pivot-or-corner fixpoint. Choose p∈Max(S) with maximal x and then maximal y. By UM1, any NE neighbor of p lies on the top row or right column. There are three regimes to analyze:
  1) Both (α:=p_x,Y) and (X,β:=p_y) lie in U. Then (2,α,β) is unique immediately (r=s=1 by UM1 and Theorem 1).
  2) Exactly one of these lies in U. If, in addition, p_x≥α₂ and p_y≥β₂ (nearest-boundary thresholds), Theorem 9 gives a unique type–1 color. Otherwise, the very boundary points preventing Theorem 9 (extra top-row points right of p_x or extra right-column points above p_y) can potentially be harvested into a D′-style L-corner or an R3/R4 singleton+extension. I will formalize a short “nearest-neighbor” lemma that either produces (2,α',β') unique at the first boundary intersection, or isolates a row/column satisfying R3/R4.
  3) Neither (α,Y) nor (X,β) lies in U. Consider the nearest top-row point a=(α*,Y) with α*>α (if any) and the nearest right-column point b=(X,β*) with β*>β (if any). If both exist, UM1 ensures the open segments above/right of p on column α and row β are empty; a and b, together with p, then form the frame of a robust L-corner at (α,β). This yields a unique type–2 color by Theorem 7. Otherwise, if only one exists, we are back in (2) with potentially a unique type–1 via Theorem 9. I will write this carefully next round (checking the emptiness claim and handling the cases when multiple boundary points exist).

- Multiple maxima (|Max(U)|≥2). For each adjacent pair we either certify uniqueness by D′ or record an “offender” in its column or row (an extra point inflating R_i or S_i). Offenders for different i live on disjoint rows/columns ({y_{i+1}} and {x_i} are all distinct). A pigeonhole/counting lemma should force that some offender actually creates a singleton+extension (R3/R4) or itself forms part of a D′ witness. I will formalize:
  • Counting Lemma (to prove): If for all i either R_i≥2 or S_i≥2 and no D′-witness exists, then there is α with exactly one row β having (α,β) and exactly one right neighbor (hence T_4(α)=1), or dually a β with exactly one column α having (α,β) and exactly one upper neighbor (T_3(β)=1).

### Next steps (concrete, auditable)
1) Curate O1, UM1, D′, R3, and R4 into output.md; these are safe and strengthen the toolset used by Theorems 9–11.
2) Write and verify the “nearest-boundary lemma” in the unique-maximal regime: with p∈Max(S) chosen extremally, show that if Theorem 9 fails then either a D′/Theorem 7 witness exists at (p_x,β*) or (α*,p_y), or a singleton+extension (R3/R4) fires on the boundary row/column.
3) Prove the counting lemma for multiple maxima by aggregating offenders on the disjoint families of rows {y_{i+1}} and columns {x_i} and extracting an R3/R4 or D′ trigger. Validate on dense staircase-like examples.

### Summary of progress this round
- No new gaps in output.md beyond a suggestion to add O1 and UM1 explicitly. The |U|=4 proof is now sound.
- Added four rigorous, reusable lemmas (O1, UM1, D′, R3/R4) with proofs, strengthening the unique-maximal and multiple-maxima toolkits.
- Outlined precise, checkable next steps to finish the unique-maximal case (via a nearest-boundary analysis) and to handle the “all consecutive maxima heavy” regime via a counting lemma.

Round 0007 — incremental, auditable progress

Overview
- I audited the current output.md. I found no new logical flaws since the last correction to Theorem 11 (|U|=4). Theorem 9 (unique–maximal threshold ⇒ unique type 1) and Theorem 10 (top-row pivot ⇒ unique type 4) are correctly stated and proved. The dual “right-column pivot ⇒ unique type 3” is intentionally not present in symmetric form (as noted in notes.md) because it needs a singleton-row hypothesis; Theorem 3 already supplies the safe version. Below I consolidate the unique–maximal case by formalizing two threshold-existence lemmas, extract a corollary for the search strategy, and add a robust L-corner variant useful in 2+2(+…) configurations.

Gaps or cautions in output.md
- None needing immediate correction. A cautionary note: the dual of Theorem 10 must remain in the singleton-row form (Theorem 3); there is no safe global dual without that assumption (see the counterexample recorded in notes.md).

New lemmas (rigorous; to be curated)

Lemma UM–X (x-threshold existence under unique maximality).
- Setting. U has a unique maximal m=(X,Y). Let T={x<X : (x,Y)∈U} and S={p∈U : p_x<X and p_y<Y}. If S≠∅ and T≠∅, define α₂=max T.
- Claim. Either (i) column α₂ contains no point below Y, in which case Theorem 10 yields a unique type–4 color; or (ii) there exists p∈Max(S) with p_x≥α₂.
- Proof. If column α₂ has no point below Y we are in (i). Otherwise pick q=(α₂,β) with β<Y; then q∈S. In any finite poset, every element is dominated by some maximal element, so there is p∈Max(S) with p≽q, hence p_x≥α₂. ∎
- Why useful. This guarantees that when the top-row pivot (Theorem 10) does not fire, there is a SW-maximal point whose x-coordinate is at least the second-rightmost top-row x, providing half of the threshold for Theorem 9.

Lemma UM–Y (y-threshold existence via the safe column pivot).
- Setting. U has a unique maximal m=(X,Y). Let R={y<Y : (X,y)∈U} and S as above. If S≠∅ and R≠∅, define β₂=max R.
- Claim. Either (i) row β₂ is a singleton (only (X,β₂)∈U), and then Theorem 3 yields a unique type–3 color; or (ii) there exists q∈Max(S) with q_y≥β₂.
- Proof. If row β₂ has only (X,β₂), then on column X there is exactly one point above (necessarily m), hence Theorem 3 applies. Otherwise pick r=(α,β₂) with α<X; then r∈S. As above, some q∈Max(S) satisfies q≽r, hence q_y≥β₂. ∎
- Why useful. This supplies the y-threshold needed for Theorem 9 whenever the safe type–3 pivot does not already resolve the instance.

Corollary (two-threshold reduction for unique–maximal).
- With m, T, R, α₂, β₂ as above. If S=∅, Theorem 8 (row∪column support) applies. If S≠∅, then:
  • If T≠∅ and the top-row pivot (Theorem 10) fails, there is p_x≥α₂ for some p∈Max(S).
  • If R≠∅ and the singleton-row pivot (Theorem 3) fails, there is q_y≥β₂ for some q∈Max(S).
  • If there exists r∈Max(S) with r_x≥α₂ and r_y≥β₂ simultaneously, Theorem 9 applies and yields a unique type–1 color.
- Interpretation. In the unique-maximal regime, unless a pivot (Theorem 10 or Theorem 3) already certifies uniqueness, we can find one (or two) SW-maximal points meeting the respective x- or y-threshold(s). The remaining unresolved subcase is when x- and y-thresholds are each met but not by the same maximal point. The next step is to convert this “crossing” into a type–2 or type–3/4 certificate (see Next steps).

A robust L-corner variant for 2+2(+…)

Lemma RL (two 2-point rows sharing a left endpoint, with clean column, ⇒ unique type 2).
- Statement. Suppose there exist two distinct rows β_1<β_2 such that: (α,β_i),(γ_i,β_i)∈U with α<γ_i (i=1,2); column α contains exactly these two points (α,β_1),(α,β_2); and on the lower row β:=β_1 there is exactly one point to the right of α (namely (γ_1,β)). Then color (2,α,β) is unique.
- Proof. By the hypotheses, in column α there is exactly one point above β (namely (α,β_2)), so r_U(α,β)=1; in row β there is exactly one point to the right of α (namely (γ_1,β)), so s_U(α,β)=1. Theorem 1 (type 2) gives uniqueness of (2,α,β). ∎
- Why useful. This is a safe, verifiable pattern extending the 4-point rectangle subcase to ambient configurations with many other points, provided column α stays clean and the lower row has exactly one extension to the right at α. It is a robust tool within the “two heavy rows” regime.

Examples (sanity checks and edge cases)
- UM–X in action. U={ (6,8) }∪{ (3,8),(5,8) }∪{ (5,4),(2,1) }. Here m=(6,8), T={3,5}, α₂=5. Column 5 has (5,4), so the top-row pivot fails. Lemma UM–X yields a p∈Max(S) with p_x≥5; indeed p=(5,4)∈Max(S).
- UM–Y in action. U={ (8,6) }∪{ (8,3),(8,5) }∪{ (4,5),(2,2) }. Here m=(8,6), R={3,5}, β₂=5. Row 5 is not a singleton, so the safe type–3 pivot fails; Lemma UM–Y produces q∈Max(S) with q_y≥5; indeed q=(4,5).
- RL example. Let U contain rows β_1=1 and β_2=4 with points (2,1),(7,1) and (2,4),(5,4); no other point in column 2. Then (2,2,1) is unique regardless of extra points elsewhere (provided column 2 remains clean and the lower row remains with exactly one right neighbor at 2).

Ideas toward closing the remaining unique–maximal subcase
- Structure. Let Max(S)={s_1,…,s_k} with x increasing and y decreasing. Under the corollary above, if both T and R are nonempty and neither pivot fires, there exist indices f,g with x(s_f)≥α₂ and y(s_g)≥β₂. If some s_i satisfies both, Theorem 9 finishes. Otherwise f>g, so s_g is “high-but-left” and s_{g+1} is “right-but-low.” This crossing suggests examining the L-corner (x(s_g), y(s_{g+1})). 
- Goal. Prove a dichotomy for this crossing pair: either the L-corner at (x(s_g), y(s_{g+1})) is clean in the sense of Theorem 7 (yielding a unique type–2 color), or one of the “offending” extra points that would inflate r_U or s_U promotes a singleton+extension (Theorem 3) or a row-of-two global trigger (R4) on some row/column. The technical task is to pin down a nearest-neighbor variant that ensures any additional contributor on the vertical (resp. horizontal) segment forces one of the safe type–3/4 triggers.
- Plan. For the vertical ray at x(s_g), pick the lowest y′>y(s_{g+1}) with (x(s_g),y′)∈U (this is either y′=y(s_g) or the nearest interloper). If y′≠y(s_g), then s_g remains maximal but row y′ is an “offender” below Y. We will analyze whether row y′ is singleton (Theorem 3), forms a 2-point row with globally unique left endpoint (R4), or can be paired with a clean column to create an RL-type L-corner. A symmetric analysis applies to the horizontal ray from (x(s_g), y(s_{g+1})).

Obstacles and why some direct attempts fail
- A tempting but false shortcut is to assume that the first crossing pair (s_g,s_{g+1}) automatically yields r_U=s_U=1 at (x(s_g), y(s_{g+1})). This fails because additional points on the vertical segment x=x(s_g) with y∈(y(s_{g+1}),y(s_g)) are compatible with s_g being maximal yet increase r_U. Hence additional structure (nearest-neighbor selection plus type–3/4 triggers) is needed.

Next steps (concrete and checkable)
1) Formalize the “nearest-neighbor offender ⇒ type–3/4 trigger” argument sketched above for the crossing pair (s_g,s_{g+1}). The desired lemma: among the lowest vertical/horizontal interlopers at a crossing, at least one induces a singleton+extension (Theorem 3) or a row-of-two with a globally unique base (R4), hence a unique type–3/4 color.
2) Package UM–X, UM–Y, and the crossing analysis into a complete proof of “unique maximal ⇒ unique color,” yielding a new theorem to curate.
3) Extend RL to a symmetric “clean-row” variant (two 2-point columns sharing a lower endpoint with a clean row ⇒ unique type 2) and add these as safe triggers to the library.
4) Stress-test on crafted worst-case “staircase with fillers” examples to validate the nearest-neighbor lemma and to calibrate the cleanliness conditions needed for Theorem 7 vs. type–3/4 triggers.

Why this is progress
- UM–X and UM–Y convert the abstract unique–maximal regime into a finite, verifiable checklist of pivots and thresholds, isolating the only remaining hard subcase (crossing without a single maximal hitting both thresholds). The RL lemma strengthens our catalog of robust, local uniqueness certificates applicable amidst additional points. The next-step plan is precise: prove a nearest-neighbor lemma at the crossing to finish the unique–maximal case.
