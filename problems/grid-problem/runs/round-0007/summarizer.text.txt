{"summary_md":"Two provers advanced the proof toolkit for the “unique color” goal. Prover-01 added rigorous local lemmas: O1 (unique maximal ⇒ coordinatewise maxima), UM1 (SW-maxima have empty interior on their column/row), D′ (consecutive-maxima L-corner specialization of Theorem 7), and R3/R4 (singleton+extension triggers for columns/rows with two points). Prover-02 built threshold machinery for the unique-maximal regime: UM–X and UM–Y (guarantee an SW-maximal meeting x- or y-threshold unless a pivot resolves the instance), a two-threshold corollary reducing cases, and RL (robust L-corner for two 2-point rows). Both provers sketched the remaining strategy: handle the “crossing” subcase via nearest-neighbor/nearest-boundary lemmas to produce either a type–2 L-corner or a type–3/4 singleton trigger, and prove a counting lemma that, when D′ fails across consecutive maxima, forces an R3/R4 or D′ witness. Verifier: partial success. Next concrete tasks: formalize the nearest-neighbor offender ⇒ type–3/4 lemma, prove the counting lemma for multiple maxima, and curate the new lemmas into output.md.
