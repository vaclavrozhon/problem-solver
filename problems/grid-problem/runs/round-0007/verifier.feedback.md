High-level assessment. Both provers delivered careful, useful additions focused on firming up the unique–maximal regime and enriching the library of safe “local triggers.” There are no new gaps in the existing output.md after the recent fix to the |U|=4 theorem. The proposed additions O1, UM1, and the global triggers R3/R4 are correct and valuable for later proofs. The “D′” (local emptiness between consecutive maxima) is a clean restatement already implied by Theorem 5 (or by Theorem 7), so I recommend keeping it as a corollary/pattern in notes rather than duplicating content in output unless we explicitly cite it later. The RL lemma is a direct instance of Theorem 7 and best recorded in notes as a pattern. The UM–X and UM–Y threshold-existence lemmas are correct and helpful scaffolding; they clarify the algorithmic search path and isolate the only remaining hard subcase (the threshold “crossing”), so I recommend adding them to notes with proofs, and then using them in the next round to complete the unique–maximal case.

Rigor audit. Minor issue: the proof text for O1 in Prover 01’s report informally argues “no v with x ≥ x′ > X” to conclude maximality; the clean argument should use the standard finite-poset fact that every element is dominated by some maximal element, hence if any element has x > X (or y > Y) there exists a second maximal element, contradicting uniqueness. I correct this in the curated version. All other proposed lemmas (UM1, R3, R4, UM–X, UM–Y) are precise consequences of the multiplicity formulas or poset maximality and check out.

Value triage. Worth curating to output.md now: O1 (explicitly supports Theorem 10), UM1 (already used implicitly in Theorem 9), and the globally safe triggers R3 and R4 (they will be used in the boundary/crossing analyses and in the multiple-maxima counting step). D′, RL, UM–X, UM–Y, and the two-threshold reduction corollary go to notes, where they sharpen the roadmap.

Promising directions and concrete next steps.
1) Nearest-neighbor/crossing lemma (unique–maximal). With Max(S) = {s_i} in increasing x (decreasing y), assume both top-row and right-column supports are nonempty and neither pivot (Theorem 10 or the singleton-row type-3 trigger) fires. Use UM–X/UM–Y to identify indices f,g with x(s_f) ≥ α₂ and y(s_g) ≥ β₂ but no single s_i hits both. Analyze the crossing pair (s_g, s_{g+1}). Define the lowest vertical interloper on x = x(s_g) above y(s_{g+1}) and the rightmost horizontal interloper on y = y(s_{g+1}) to the right of x(s_g). Prove: at least one interloper forces either (a) a singleton+extension (Theorem 3) or (b) a row/column-of-two with globally unique base (R3/R4), or else (c) both segments are clean and Theorem 7 yields a unique type-2 at (x(s_g), y(s_{g+1})).
2) Package the above into a complete “unique maximal ⇒ unique color” theorem. The structure is now a short casework using Theorems 8–10, UM–X/UM–Y, UM1, Theorem 7, and R3/R4.
3) Multiple maxima counting lemma. For M = {m_i} consecutive pairs, if no D′ witness exists, then for each i at least one of R_i, S_i is ≥ 2. Since the rows {y_{i+1}} and columns {x_i} are disjoint across i, collect offenders: show that the global sum of “excess contributors” forces either a singleton+extension (Theorem 3) or a row/column-of-two with a globally unique base (R4/R3), or creates a D′ witness on some adjacent pair. Prepare explicit bounds and verify on staircase-with-fillers families.
4) Stress tests. Build a library of “staircase + boundary fillers” to test the nearest-neighbor lemma; confirm that either Theorem 7 applies cleanly or a type-3/4 trigger fires via the first interloper.

I have curated O1, UM1, R3, R4 into output.md with clean proofs, and appended UM–X, UM–Y, the two-threshold reduction, and the crossing blueprint into notes.md. Verdict: partial success; we have strengthened the toolkit and clarified the path to finish the unique–maximal case and to advance the multiple-maxima regime.
