Both provers delivered careful, useful additions focused on firming up the unique–maximal regime and enriching the library of safe “local triggers.” There are no new gaps in the existing output.md after the recent fix to the |U|=4 theorem. The proposed additions O1, UM1, and the global triggers R3/R4 are correct and valuable for later proofs. The “D′” (local emptiness between consecutive maxima) is a clean restatement already implied by Theorem 5 (or by Theorem 7), so I recommend keeping it as a corollary/pattern in notes rather than duplicating content in output unless we explicitly cite it later. The RL lemma is a direct instance of Theorem 7 and best recorded in notes as a pattern. The UM–X and UM–Y threshold-existence lemmas are correct and helpful scaffolding; they clarify the algorithmic search path and isolate the only remaining hard subcase (the threshold “crossing”), so I recommend adding them to notes with proofs, and then using them in the next round to complete the unique–maximal case.\\n\\nRigor audit. Minor issue: the proof text for O1 in Prover 01’s report informally argues “no v with x ≥ x′ > X” to conclude maximality; the clean argument should use the standard finite-poset fact that every element is dominated by some maximal element, hence if any element has x > X (or y > Y) there exists a second maximal element, contradicting uniqueness. I correct this in the curated version. All other proposed lemmas (UM1, R3, R4, UM–X, UM–Y) are precise consequences of the multiplicity formulas or poset maximality and check out.\\n\\nValue triage. Worth curating to output.md now: O1 (explicitly supports Theorem 10), UM1 (already used implicitly in Theorem 9), and the globally safe triggers R3 and R4 (they will be used in the boundary/crossing analyses and in the multiple-maxima counting step). D′, RL, UM–X, UM–Y, and the two-threshold reduction corollary go to notes, where they sharpen the roadmap.\\n\\nPromising directions and concrete next steps.\\n1) Nearest-neighbor/crossing lemma (unique–maximal). With Max(S) = {s_i} in increasing x (decreasing y), assume both top-row and right-column supports are nonempty and neither pivot (Theorem 10 or the singleton-row type-3 trigger) fires. Use UM–X/UM–Y to identify indices f,g with x(s_f) ≥ α₂ and y(s_g) ≥ β₂ but no single s_i hits both. Analyze the crossing pair (s_g, s_{g+1}). Define the lowest vertical interloper on x = x(s_g) above y(s_{g+1}) and the rightmost horizontal interloper on y = y(s_{g+1}) to the right of x(s_g). Prove: at least one interloper forces either (a) a singleton+extension (Theorem 3) or (b) a row/column-of-two with globally unique base (R3/R4), or else (c) both segments are clean and Theorem 7 yields a unique type-2 at (x(s_g), y(s_{g+1})).\\n2) Package the above into a complete “unique maximal ⇒ unique color” theorem. The structure is now a short casework using Theorems 8–10, UM–X/UM–Y, UM1, Theorem 7, and R3/R4.\\n3) Multiple maxima counting lemma. For M = {m_i} consecutive pairs, if no D′ witness exists, then for each i at least one of R_i, S_i is ≥ 2. Since the rows {y_{i+1}} and columns {x_i} are disjoint across i, collect offenders: show that the global sum of “excess contributors” forces either a singleton+extension (Theorem 3) or a row/column-of-two with a globally unique base (R4/R3), or creates a D′ witness on some adjacent pair. Prepare explicit bounds and verify on staircase-with-fillers families.\\n4) Stress tests. Build a library of “staircase + boundary fillers” to test the nearest-neighbor lemma; confirm that either Theorem 7 applies cleanly or a type-3/4 trigger fires via the first interloper.\\n\\nI have curated O1, UM1, R3, R4 into output.md with clean proofs, and appended UM–X, UM–Y, the two-threshold reduction, and the crossing blueprint into notes.md. Verdict: partial success; we have strengthened the toolkit and clarified the path to finish the unique–maximal case and to advance the multiple-maxima regime.\",\"new_notes_md\":\"Addenda: unique–maximal thresholds and crossing analysis\\n\\nDefinitions. Let U ⊆ [n]×[n] and assume U has a unique maximal element m = (X,Y) in the product order. Define\\n- T = { x < X : (x,Y) ∈ U } and, if T ≠ ∅, α₂ = max T.\\n- R = { y < Y : (X,y) ∈ U } and, if R ≠ ∅, β₂ = max R.\\n- S = { p ∈ U : p_x < X and p_y < Y }, and let Max(S) denote its product-order maximal elements.\\n\\nThreshold-existence lemmas (for search reduction).\\n- Lemma UM–X (x-threshold). If S ≠ ∅ and T ≠ ∅, then either (i) column α₂ contains no point below Y, in which case Theorem 10 applies and yields a unique type-4 color, or (ii) there exists p ∈ Max(S) with p_x ≥ α₂.\\n  Proof. If column α₂ has no point below Y, we are in (i). Otherwise pick q = (α₂,β) with β < Y, so q ∈ S. In any finite poset, q is dominated by some p ∈ Max(S), hence p_x ≥ α₂.\\n- Lemma UM–Y (y-threshold). If S ≠ ∅ and R ≠ ∅, then either (i) row β₂ is a singleton {(X,β₂)} and Theorem 3 applies (unique type-3), or (ii) there exists q ∈ Max(S) with q_y ≥ β₂.\\n  Proof. If row β₂ is a singleton, we are in (i). Otherwise take r = (α,β₂) with α < X, so r ∈ S and is dominated by some q ∈ Max(S), whence q_y ≥ β₂.\\n\\nCorollary (two-threshold reduction for unique–maximal). In the unique–maximal regime, unless a pivot is already available (Theorem 10 or the safe type-3 singleton-row trigger), we can locate p,q ∈ Max(S) meeting the x- and y-thresholds respectively (p_x ≥ α₂ and q_y ≥ β₂). If some s ∈ Max(S) meets both thresholds simultaneously, Theorem 9 yields a unique type-1 color. The only unresolved subcase is the crossing: x-threshold and y-threshold are met, but by different maxima.\\n\\nCrossing-pair blueprint. List Max(S) as s_1, …, s_k with x increasing and y decreasing. Suppose indices f,g exist with x(s_f) ≥ α₂ and y(s_g) ≥ β₂ but no single s_i satisfies both. Then g ≥ f and, in fact, f > g. Consider the L-corner at (x(s_g), y(s_{g+1})).\\n- Vertical ray at x = x(s_g): let y_v be the minimum y ∈ (y(s_{g+1}), Y) with (x(s_g), y) ∈ U, if any (else the ray is clean).\\n- Horizontal ray at y = y(s_{g+1}): let x_h be the minimum x ∈ (x(s_g), X) with (x, y(s_{g+1})) ∈ U, if any (else the ray is clean).\\nDichotomy to establish next: If both rays are clean up to their boundary supports, then Theorem 7 applies at (x(s_g), y(s_{g+1})) and yields a unique type-2 color. Otherwise, analyze the nearest interloper(s) at y_v and/or x_h; prove that at least one induces a safe unique color via either Theorem 3 (singleton+extension) or the global triggers R3/R4. This will complete the unique–maximal case.\\n\\nPattern library (robust L-corner in a 2+2(+…)).\\n- RL (two 2-point rows sharing a left endpoint with a clean column ⇒ unique type 2). If rows β₁ < β₂ have (α,β_i) and (γ_i,β_i) with α < γ_i (i=1,2), column α contains exactly (α,β₁),(α,β₂), and on the lower row β=β₁ there is exactly one point to the right of α (namely (γ₁,β)), then by Theorem 7 we have a unique (2,α,β).\\n\\nMultiple maxima: counting lemma (work-in-progress). For M = Max(U) listed as m_i=(x_i,y_i) with x_1<…<x_k and y_1>…>y_k, define R_i and S_i as in Theorem 5. If no D′-witness exists for any i, then for each i at least one of R_i, S_i is ≥ 2. Since the rows {y_{i+1}} and columns {x_i} are disjoint across i, collect the “excess” contributors across all i and prove that some row/column must realize a singleton+extension (Theorem 3) or one of the global triggers R3/R4 (hence a unique type-3/4), or else a D′-witness appears, contradicting the assumption. Formalize an exact inequality to conclude.\\n\\nStress tests to design. “Staircase + boundary fillers” families where Max(U) is a long chain, and rows y_{i+1} and columns x_i have either clean rays or minimally dirty rays (single interloper). Use them to verify the nearest-interloper analysis and to calibrate when Theorem 7 vs. type-3/4 triggers apply.\\n\",\"new_notes_append\":\"True\",\"new_outputs_md\":\"Auxiliary lemmas (supporting Theorems 9–11 and later triggers)\\n\\nLemma O1 (unique maximal ⇒ coordinatewise maxima).\\nStatement. If U has a unique maximal element m=(X,Y) in the product order, then X = max{ x : (x,·) ∈ U } and Y = max{ y : (·,y) ∈ U }.\\nProof. Suppose some u=(x′,y′) ∈ U has x′ > X. In any finite poset, u is dominated by some maximal element m′ (i.e., m′ ≥ u coordinatewise). Then m′_x ≥ x′ > X, so m′ ≠ m, contradicting uniqueness. The case y′ > Y is symmetric. Therefore no point of U has x > X or y > Y, proving the claim.\\n\\nLemma UM1 (SW-maxima have only boundary NE neighbors).\\nSetup. Assume U has a unique maximal m=(X,Y). Let S={ p ∈ U : p_x < X and p_y < Y } and Max(S) its product-order maximal elements.\\nStatement. If p=(α,β) ∈ Max(S), then: (i) there is no q ∈ U with x=α and β < y < Y; (ii) there is no q ∈ U with y=β and α < x < X. Consequently, every NE neighbor of p lies on the top row y=Y or the right column x=X.\\nProof. If q=(α,y) with β<y<Y existed, then q ∈ S and q ≻ p, contradicting p ∈ Max(S). The horizontal case is analogous. The consequence follows immediately.\\n\\nCorollary R4 (row-of-two with globally unique left endpoint ⇒ unique type 4).\\nStatement. Suppose there exists a row β with exactly two points (α,β),(α′,β) ∈ U with α<α′. Assume furthermore that for every β′ ≠ β either (α,β′) ∉ U or there is no point (x,β′) with x>α. Then the color (4,α) appears exactly once in G[U].\\nProof. By the type-4 multiplicity formula, T_4(α)=∑_{β''} 1_{(α,β'')∈U} · h_{β''}(α). By hypothesis, only β contributes (since (α,β'')∉U for β''≠β or h_{β''}(α)=0 there), and on row β we have h_β(α)=1 (exactly one right neighbor at α′). Hence T_4(α)=1 and (4,α) is unique.\\n\\nCorollary R3 (column-of-two with globally unique lower endpoint ⇒ unique type 3).\\nStatement. Suppose there exists a column α with exactly two points (α,β),(α,β′) ∈ U with β<β′. Assume furthermore that for every α′ ≠ α either (α′,β) ∉ U or there is no point (α′,y) with y>β. Then the color (3,β) appears exactly once in G[U].\\nProof. By the type-3 multiplicity formula, T_3(β)=∑_{α''} 1_{(α'',β)∈U} · v_{α''}(β). By hypothesis, only α contributes (since (α'',β)∉U for α''≠α or v_{α''}(β)=0 there), and in column α we have v_α(β)=1 (exactly one point above at β′). Hence T_3(β)=1 and (3,β) is unique.\\n\",\"new_outputs_append\":\"True\",\"verdict\":\"partial success\"}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"auto","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"VerifierNewSchema","schema_":{"properties":{"feedback_md":{"title":"Feedback Md","type":"string"},"new_notes_md":{"title":"New Notes Md","type":"string"},"new_notes_append":{"title":"New Notes Append","type":"string"},"new_outputs_md":{"title":"New Outputs Md","type":"string"},"new_outputs_append":{"title":"New Outputs Append","type":"string"},"verdict":{"title":"Verdict","type":"string"}},"required":["feedback_md","new_notes_md","new_notes_append","new_outputs_md","new_outputs_append","verdict"],"title":"VerifierNewSchema","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":14324,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":10134,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":6976},"total_tokens":24458},"user":null,"store":true}
