High-level assessment. Both provers delivered careful, useful additions focused on firming up the unique–maximal regime and enriching the library of safe “local triggers.” There are no new gaps in the existing output.md after the recent fix to the |U|=4 theorem. The proposed additions O1, UM1, and the global triggers R3/R4 are correct and valuable for later proofs. The “D′” (local emptiness between consecutive maxima) is a clean restatement already implied by Theorem 5 (or by Theorem 7), so I recommend keeping it as a corollary/pattern in notes rather than duplicating content in output unless we explicitly cite it later. The RL lemma is a direct instance of Theorem 7 and best recorded in notes as a pattern. The UM–X and UM–Y threshold-existence lemmas are correct and helpful scaffolding; they clarify the algorithmic search path and isolate the only remaining hard subcase (the threshold “crossing”), so I recommend adding them to notes with proofs, and then using them in the next round t
