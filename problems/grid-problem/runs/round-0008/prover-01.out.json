  "progress_md": "### Audit of output.md (this round)\n- No new gaps found in the currently curated Theorems 1\u201311 and auxiliary lemmas O1, UM1, R3, R4. The proof of Theorem 11 (|U|=4) is now sound after the fix via Theorem 7. \n- Minor note (not an error): Theorem 6\u2019s last bullet is still terse (the \u201cremaining permutations\u201d assertion). It is acceptable as curated, but could be expanded later by explicitly identifying the consecutive x-order pair yielding r=s=1.\n\n### New rigorous lemmas (ready to curate) \u2014 strengthening the unique\u2013maximal toolkit\n\n1) Lemma UM2\u2032 (SW-max with both boundary contacts \u21d2 unique type 2)\nStatement. Let U have a unique maximal element m=(X,Y). Let S={p\u2208U: p_x<X and p_y<Y} and let Max(S) be its product-order maximal elements. If p=(\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2208Max(S) and both boundary-aligned points (\u03b1,Y)\u2208U and (X,\u03b2)\u2208U exist, then the color (2,\u03b1,\u03b2) occurs exactly once in G[U].\nProof. By Lemma UM1 (in output.md), there is no (\u03b1,y) with \u03b2<y<Y and no (x,\u03b2) with \u03b1<x<X. Thus r_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)=1 (the unique point above \u03b2 in column \u03b1 is (\u03b1,Y)) and s_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)=1 (the unique point to the right of \u03b1 in row \u03b2 is (X,\u03b2)). By the type\u20132 multiplicity formula (Theorem 1), the color (2,\u03b1,\u03b2) is unique. \u220e\nWhy useful: This is a sharp, local certificate for unique type\u20132 in the unique\u2013maximal regime that does not require threshold conditions. It complements Theorem 9 (type\u20131 via thresholds) and Theorem 10 (top-row pivot), and is often easy to verify in practice.\n\n2) Theorem UM-single (unique maximal with a single SW-max \u21d2 a unique color)\nStatement. Suppose U has a unique maximal element m=(X,Y), and S={p\u2208U: p_x<X and p_y<Y} is nonempty but has a single product-order maximal element: Max(S)={p} with p=(\u03b1,\u03b2). Then G[U] has a uniquely colored edge.\nProof. Let T={x<X : (x,Y)\u2208U}, and if T\u2260\u2205 set \u03b1\u2082=max T; let R={y<Y : (X,y)\u2208U}, and if R\u2260\u2205 set \u03b2\u2082=max R. We split into cases.\n- Case A: T=\u2205 and R=\u2205. Then there are no top-row or right-column points other than m. By UM1, any NE neighbor of p must lie on the top row or right column; hence p\u2019s only NE neighbor is m, so the type\u20131 color (1,\u03b1,\u03b2) is unique by Theorem 1 (type 1 multiplicity).\n- Case B: T\u2260\u2205 and the top-row pivot fires. If column \u03b1\u2082 contains no point below Y, Theorem 10 gives a unique type\u20134 color; we are done.\n- Case C: R\u2260\u2205 and the safe column pivot fires. If row \u03b2\u2082 is a singleton {(X,\u03b2\u2082)}, then by Theorem 3 (singleton+extension) the color (3,\u03b2\u2082) is unique; we are done.\n- Case D: T\u2260\u2205, the top-row pivot fails (so column \u03b1\u2082 contains some (\u03b1\u2082,\u03b2\u2032) with \u03b2\u2032<Y), and R=\u2205. By Lemma UM\u2013X (proved in notes.md), since the pivot failed and Max(S)={p}, we have p_x\u2265\u03b1\u2082. Because R=\u2205, there is no (X,y) with y<Y. By UM1, any NE neighbor of p lies on the top row or right column; the right column contributes no NE neighbor (R=\u2205), and on the top row every point obeys x\u2264\u03b1\u2082\u2264p_x, so none lie strictly to the right of p. Thus p\u2019s only NE neighbor is m, and (1,\u03b1,\u03b2) is unique.\n- Case E: R\u2260\u2205, the safe column pivot fails (row \u03b2\u2082 has an additional point (\u03b1\u2032,\u03b2\u2082) with \u03b1\u2032<X), and T=\u2205. By Lemma UM\u2013Y (proved in notes.md), since the pivot failed and Max(S)={p}, we have p_y\u2265\u03b2\u2082. Because T=\u2205, there are no top-row points other than m. By UM1, all NE neighbors of p must lie on the top row or right column; the top row contributes none (T=\u2205), and the right column has no point strictly above p_y other than m because p_y\u2265\u03b2\u2082=max{y<Y:(X,y)\u2208U}. Hence p\u2019s only NE neighbor is m, and (1,\u03b1,\u03b2) is unique.\n- Case F: T\u2260\u2205 and R\u2260\u2205, and neither pivot fires. Then by UM\u2013X and UM\u2013Y (notes.md) and Max(S)={p}, we get p_x\u2265\u03b1\u2082 and p_y\u2265\u03b2\u2082. Theorem 9 applies, showing p has exactly one NE neighbor (m), so (1,\u03b1,\u03b2) is unique.\nThese cases exhaust all possibilities. \u220e\nWhy useful: This cleanly resolves the unique\u2013maximal regime whenever S has a single maximal element. It collapses many subcases into threshold/pivot checks and reduces the remaining difficulty to configurations with |Max(S)|\u22652.\n\nRemark. In several subcases above, if both (\u03b1,Y) and (X,\u03b2) happen to lie in U, Lemma UM2\u2032 immediately gives a unique type\u20132 color at (2,\u03b1,\u03b2) without invoking thresholds.\n\n### Examples validating the new lemmas\n- UM2\u2032 example. Let U contain m=(7,7), p=(3,2), and also (3,7),(7,2); assume no points on the open vertical segment x=3, y\u2208(2,7), nor on the open horizontal segment y=2, x\u2208(3,7) (these are excluded by p\u2208Max(S) via UM1). Then r_U(3,2)=s_U(3,2)=1, so (2,3,2) is unique.\n- UM-single, Case D. U has m=(8,8), top-row points at x=2,5,6 (\u03b1\u2082=6) and no right-column points below Y. Let S contain points strictly SW, and suppose Max(S)={p=(6,1)}. The top-row pivot fails since column 6 has (6,1). UM\u2013X yields p_x\u2265\u03b1\u2082=6; with R=\u2205, p\u2019s only NE neighbor is m, so (1,6,1) is unique.\n- UM-single, Case F. U has m=(6,6), top-row x\u2019s {2,4,5} (\u03b1\u2082=5), right-column y\u2019s {1,3} (\u03b2\u2082=3), and Max(S)={p=(5,3)}. Both pivots fail. Since p meets both thresholds, Theorem 9 gives (1,5,3) unique.\n\n### A small symmetric pattern (robust L-corner variant; optional to curate)\nLemma RL\u2032 (two 2-point columns sharing a lower endpoint with a clean row \u21d2 unique type 2).\n- Statement. Suppose there exist \u03b1<\u03b1\u2032 and \u03b2<\u03b2_1,\u03b2_2 such that in column \u03b1 we have exactly (\u03b1,\u03b2),(\u03b1,\u03b2_1), in column \u03b1\u2032 we have exactly (\u03b1\u2032,\u03b2),(\u03b1\u2032,\u03b2_2), and row \u03b2 contains exactly the two points (\u03b1,\u03b2),(\u03b1\u2032,\u03b2). Then (2,\u03b1,\u03b2) is unique.\n- Proof. In column \u03b1 there is exactly one point above \u03b2, namely (\u03b1,\u03b2_1), so r_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)=1. In row \u03b2 there is exactly one point to the right of \u03b1, namely (\u03b1\u2032,\u03b2), so s_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)=1. Theorem 1 (type 2) yields uniqueness. \u220e\n- Why useful: This is the column-dual of Lemma RL recorded in notes.md. Both are robust instances of Theorem 7 and are convenient \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d certificates in 2+2(+\u2026) patterns.\n\n### How this advances the overall proof\n- Theorem UM-single settles the unique\u2013maximal regime whenever the down-left region under m has a single maximal element. Together with Theorems 8\u201310, this eliminates a large family of layouts. What remains in the unique\u2013maximal regime is the |Max(S)|\u22652 case, for which the planned \u201ccrossing-pair\u201d analysis applies.\n- Lemma UM2\u2032 adds a simple, verifiable trigger for unique type\u20132 localized at any SW-maximal p having both boundary contacts; it will be a key branch in the crossing analysis when both nearest boundary supports exist.\n\n### Toward the remaining hard case (|Max(S)| \u2265 2): blueprint recap and refinement\n- Setup. With m=(X,Y), list Max(S) in increasing x (hence decreasing y) as s_1,\u2026,s_k, k\u22652. If both T and R are nonempty and neither pivot fires, notes.md (UM\u2013X/UM\u2013Y corollary) yields indices f,g with x(s_f)\u2265\u03b1\u2082 and y(s_g)\u2265\u03b2\u2082 but no single s_i meets both. Then f>g. Consider the \u201ccrossing L-corner\u201d at (x(s_g), y(s_{g+1})).\n- Clean corner \u21d2 unique type 2. If the open vertical segment x=x(s_g), y\u2208(y(s_{g+1}), y(s_g)) and the open horizontal segment y=y(s_{g+1}), x\u2208(x(s_g), x(s_{g+1})) are both empty, Theorem 7/D\u2032 gives a unique type\u20132 color (2, x(s_g), y(s_{g+1})).\n- Next target (nearest-interloper lemma). Define y_v as the minimum y in (y(s_{g+1}),Y) with (x(s_g),y)\u2208U if any; define x_h as the minimum x in (x(s_g),X) with (x,y(s_{g+1}))\u2208U if any. I will prove next that at least one of the nearest interlopers (if present) can be converted into a safe type\u20133/4 uniqueness via Theorem 3 or R3/R4, or else the corner is clean and Theorem 7 applies. This will close the |Max(S)|\u22652 unique\u2013maximal case.\n\n### Obstacles\n- The nearest-interloper conversion requires careful global control to ensure no other rows/columns contribute to T_3/T_4 outside the intended witness (hence the use of R3/R4, not just a raw vertical/horizontal edge). The construction must leverage that offenders for different consecutive maxima lie on disjoint rows and columns, allowing us to isolate a globally unique base.\n\n### Next steps (concrete and auditable)\n1) Curate Lemma UM2\u2032 and Theorem UM-single into output.md (both are short and rely only on UM1 and Theorems 1, 3, 9, 10 and UM\u2013X/UM\u2013Y already proved in notes.md).\n2) Prove the \u201cnearest-interloper lemma\u201d for the crossing pair (s_g, s_{g+1}): at least one of y_v or x_h enforces a safe R3/R4 or Theorem 3 trigger; otherwise the corner is clean and Theorem 7 applies. I will present the exact statement and proof next round.\n3) Optional: curate RL\u2032 (column-dual robust L-corner) as a pattern in notes.md for use in the crossing analysis.\n4) Stress-test UM-single and UM2\u2032 on crafted examples (dense boundaries; sparse interiors) and begin assembling a complete \u201cunique maximal \u21d2 unique color\u201d theorem using the pivot-or-corner strategy.\n\n### Why this is progress\n- UM2\u2032 adds a robust, local type\u20132 certificate directly at SW-maxima; UM-single settles the entire unique\u2013maximal regime when the SW region has a single maximal, further shrinking the open set of configurations. The blueprint for the remaining |Max(S)|\u22652 case is sharpened to a concrete nearest-interloper analysis aligned with the safe global triggers already curated (Theorem 3, R3, R4, Theorem 7)."
