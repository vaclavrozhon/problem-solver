The proof of Theorem 11 (|U|=4) is now sound after the fix via Theorem 7. \\n- Minor note (not an error): Theorem 6’s last bullet is still terse (the “remaining permutations” assertion). It is acceptable as curated, but could be expanded later by explicitly identifying the consecutive x-order pair yielding r=s=1.\\n\\n### New rigorous lemmas (ready to curate) — strengthening the unique–maximal toolkit\\n\\n1) Lemma UM2′ (SW-max with both boundary contacts ⇒ unique type 2)\\nStatement. Let U have a unique maximal element m=(X,Y). Let S={p∈U: p_x<X and p_y<Y} and let Max(S) be its product-order maximal elements. If p=(α,β)∈Max(S) and both boundary-aligned points (α,Y)∈U and (X,β)∈U exist, then the color (2,α,β) occurs exactly once in G[U].\\nProof. By Lemma UM1 (in output.md), there is no (α,y) with β<y<Y and no (x,β) with α<x<X. Thus r_U(α,β)=1 (the unique point above β in column α is (α,Y)) and s_U(α,β)=1 (the unique point to the right of α in row β is (X,β)). By the type–2 multiplicity formula (Theorem 1), the color (2,α,β) is unique. ∎\\nWhy useful: This is a sharp, local certificate for unique type–2 in the unique–maximal regime that does not require threshold conditions. It complements Theorem 9 (type–1 via thresholds) and Theorem 10 (top-row pivot), and is often easy to verify in practice.\\n\\n2) Theorem UM-single (unique maximal with a single SW-max ⇒ a unique color)\\nStatement. Suppose U has a unique maximal element m=(X,Y), and S={p∈U: p_x<X and p_y<Y} is nonempty but has a single product-order maximal element: Max(S)={p} with p=(α,β). Then G[U] has a uniquely colored edge.\\nProof. Let T={x<X : (x,Y)∈U}, and if T≠∅ set α₂=max T; let R={y<Y : (X,y)∈U}, and if R≠∅ set β₂=max R. We split into cases.\\n- Case A: T=∅ and R=∅. Then there are no top-row or right-column points other than m. By UM1, any NE neighbor of p must lie on the top row or right column; hence p’s only NE neighbor is m, so the type–1 color (1,α,β) is unique by Theorem 1 (type 1 multiplicity).\\n- Case B: T≠∅ and the top-row pivot fires. If column α₂ contains no point below Y, Theorem 10 gives a unique type–4 color; we are done.\\n- Case C: R≠∅ and the safe column pivot fires. If row β₂ is a singleton {(X,β₂)}, then by Theorem 3 (singleton+extension) the color (3,β₂) is unique; we are done.\\n- Case D: T≠∅, the top-row pivot fails (so column α₂ contains some (α₂,β′) with β′<Y), and R=∅. By Lemma UM–X (proved in notes.md), since the pivot failed and Max(S)={p}, we have p_x≥α₂. Because R=∅, there is no (X,y) with y<Y. By UM1, any NE neighbor of p lies on the top row or right column; the right column contributes no NE neighbor (R=∅), and on the top row every point obeys x≤α₂≤p_x, so none lie strictly to the right of p. Thus p’s only NE neighbor is m, and (1,α,β) is unique.\\n- Case E: R≠∅, the safe column pivot fails (row β₂ has an additional point (α′,β₂) with α′<X), and T=∅. By Lemma UM–Y (proved in notes.md), since the pivot failed and Max(S)={p}, we have p_y≥β₂. Because T=∅, there are no top-row points other than m. By UM1, all NE neighbors of p must lie on the top row or right column; the top row contributes none (T=∅), and the right column has no point strictly above p_y other than m because p_y≥β₂=max{y<Y:(X,y)∈U}. Hence p’s only NE neighbor is m, and (1,α,β) is unique.\\n- Case F: T≠∅ and R≠∅, and neither pivot fires. Then by UM–X and UM–Y (notes.md) and Max(S)={p}, we get p_x≥α₂ and p_y≥β₂. Theorem 9 applies, showing p has exactly one NE neighbor (m), so (1,α,β) is unique.\\nThese cases exhaust all possibilities. ∎\\nWhy useful: This cleanly resolves the unique–maximal regime whenever S has a single maximal element. It collapses many subcases into threshold/pivot checks and reduces the remaining difficulty to configurations with |Max(S)|≥2.\\n\\nRemark. In several subcases above, if both (α,Y) and (X,β) happen to lie in U, Lemma UM2′ immediately gives a unique type–2 color at (2,α,β) without invoking thresholds.\\n\\n### Examples validating the new lemmas\\n- UM2′ example. Let U contain m=(7,7), p=(3,2), and also (3,7),(7,2); assume no points on the open vertical segment x=3, y∈(2,7), nor on the open horizontal segment y=2, x∈(3,7) (these are excluded by p∈Max(S) via UM1). Then r_U(3,2)=s_U(3,2)=1, so (2,3,2) is unique.\\n- UM-single, Case D. U has m=(8,8), top-row points at x=2,5,6 (α₂=6) and no right-column points below Y. Let S contain points strictly SW, and suppose Max(S)={p=(6,1)}. The top-row pivot fails since column 6 has (6,1). UM–X yields p_x≥α₂=6; with R=∅, p’s only NE neighbor is m, so (1,6,1) is unique.\\n- UM-single, Case F. U has m=(6,6), top-row x’s {2,4,5} (α₂=5), right-column y’s {1,3} (β₂=3), and Max(S)={p=(5,3)}. Both pivots fail. Since p meets both thresholds, Theorem 9 gives (1,5,3) unique.\\n\\n### A small symmetric pattern (robust L-corner variant; optional to curate)\\nLemma RL′ (two 2-point columns sharing a lower endpoint with a clean row ⇒ unique type 2).\\n- Statement. Suppose there exist α<α′ and β<β_1,β_2 such that in column α we have exactly (α,β),(α,β_1), in column α′ we have exactly (α′,β),(α′,β_2), and row β contains exactly the two points (α,β),(α′,β). Then (2,α,β) is unique.\\n- Proof. In column α there is exactly one point above β, namely (α,β_1), so r_U(α,β)=1. In row β there is exactly one point to the right of α, namely (α′,β), so s_U(α,β)=1. Theorem 1 (type 2) yields uniqueness. ∎\\n- Why useful: This is the column-dual of Lemma RL recorded in notes.md. Both are robust instances of Theorem 7 and are convenient “off-the-shelf” certificates in 2+2(+…) patterns.\\n\\n### How this advances the overall proof\\n- Theorem UM-single settles the unique–maximal regime whenever the down-left region under m has a single maximal element. Together with Theorems 8–10, this eliminates a large family of layouts. What remains in the unique–maximal regime is the |Max(S)|≥2 case, for which the planned “crossing-pair” analysis applies.\\n- Lemma UM2′ adds a simple, verifiable trigger for unique type–2 localized at any SW-maximal p having both boundary contacts; it will be a key branch in the crossing analysis when both nearest boundary supports exist.\\n\\n### Toward the remaining hard case (|Max(S)| ≥ 2): blueprint recap and refinement\\n- Setup. With m=(X,Y), list Max(S) in increasing x (hence decreasing y) as s_1,…,s_k, k≥2. If both T and R are nonempty and neither pivot fires, notes.md (UM–X/UM–Y corollary) yields indices f,g with x(s_f)≥α₂ and y(s_g)≥β₂ but no single s_i meets both. Then f>g. Consider the “crossing L-corner” at (x(s_g), y(s_{g+1})).\\n- Clean corner ⇒ unique type 2. If the open vertical segment x=x(s_g), y∈(y(s_{g+1}), y(s_g)) and the open horizontal segment y=y(s_{g+1}), x∈(x(s_g), x(s_{g+1})) are both empty, Theorem 7/D′ gives a unique type–2 color (2, x(s_g), y(s_{g+1})).\\n- Next target (nearest-interloper lemma). Define y_v as the minimum y in (y(s_{g+1}),Y) with (x(s_g),y)∈U if any; define x_h as the minimum x in (x(s_g),X) with (x,y(s_{g+1}))∈U if any. I will prove next that at least one of the nearest interlopers (if present) can be converted into a safe type–3/4 uniqueness via Theorem 3 or R3/R4, or else the corner is clean and Theorem 7 applies. This will close the |Max(S)|≥2 unique–maximal case.\\n\\n### Obstacles\\n- The nearest-interloper conversion requires careful global control to ensure no other rows/columns contribute to T_3/T_4 outside the intended witness (hence the use of R3/R4, not just a raw vertical/horizontal edge). The construction must leverage that offenders for different consecutive maxima lie on disjoint rows and columns, allowing us to isolate a globally unique base.\\n\\n### Next steps (concrete and auditable)\\n1) Curate Lemma UM2′ and Theorem UM-single into output.md (both are short and rely only on UM1 and Theorems 1, 3, 9, 10 and UM–X/UM–Y already proved in notes.md).\\n2) Prove the “nearest-interloper lemma” for the crossing pair (s_g, s_{g+1}): at least one of y_v or x_h enforces a safe R3/R4 or Theorem 3 trigger; otherwise the corner is clean and Theorem 7 applies. I will present the exact statement and proof next round.\\n3) Optional: curate RL′ (column-dual robust L-corner) as a pattern in notes.md for use in the crossing analysis.\\n4) Stress-test UM-single and UM2′ on crafted examples (dense boundaries; sparse interiors) and begin assembling a complete “unique maximal ⇒ unique color” theorem using the pivot-or-corner strategy.\\n\\n### Why this is progress\\n- UM2′ adds a robust, local type–2 certificate directly at SW-maxima; UM-single settles the entire unique–maximal regime when the SW region has a single maximal, further shrinking the open set of configurations. The blueprint for the remaining |Max(S)|≥2 case is sharpened to a concrete nearest-interloper analysis aligned with the safe global triggers already curated (Theorem 3, R3, R4, Theorem 7).\"}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"auto","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"ProverOutput","schema_":{"properties":{"progress_md":{"description":"Append-only progress notes","title":"Progress Md","type":"string"}},"required":["progress_md"],"title":"ProverOutput","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":38204,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":14152,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":11328},"total_tokens":52356},"user":null,"store":true}
