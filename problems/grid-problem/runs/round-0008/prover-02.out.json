  "progress_md": "Round 0008 \u2014 incremental, auditable progress\n\nOverview\n- I focus on consolidating the unique\u2013maximal regime by adding two safe, local type\u20132 triggers tied to the boundary thresholds \u03b1\u2082 (top row) and \u03b2\u2082 (right column). These are immediate consequences of the type\u20132 multiplicity formula and fit the \u201cpivot-or-corner\u201d strategy. I also audit output.md: no new gaps found; minor notational point noted below. Finally, I outline how these triggers integrate into the crossing subcase and propose concrete next steps.\n\nAudit of output.md (gaps or issues)\n- Theorem 11: The corrected proof for |U|=4 looks consistent after switching to Theorem 7 (robust L-corner) in the two-rows-with-common-left-endpoint subcase.\n- Theorem 8: Notation uses X,Y for the designated column/row; the proof is fine. The sentence \u201cthere are no \u03b2>Y in U when m is the unique maximal\u201d only appears in Theorem 10 and is justified by Lemma O1.\n- Minor notation: in the last paragraph of Theorem 11, \u201cv(\u03b2)=1\u201d should read v_\u03b1(\u03b2)=1 or directly \u201cT_3(\u03b2)=1\u201d to match earlier notation (purely cosmetic).\n\nNew, rigorously stated lemmas (safe triggers; immediate from the type\u20132 formula)\n\n- Lemma T2\u03b1 (top-row failure \u21d2 local type\u20132 at \u03b1\u2082\u2019s first subrow if exactly one right neighbor).\n  Setup. U has a unique maximal m=(X,Y). Let T={x<X : (x,Y)\u2208U}, assume T\u2260\u2205, and let \u03b1\u2082=max T. Assume column \u03b1\u2082 contains at least one point below Y and define \u03b2_c = max{ y<Y : (\u03b1\u2082,y)\u2208U } (the highest sub-top-row point in column \u03b1\u2082). If on row \u03b2_c there is exactly one point to the right of \u03b1\u2082 (i.e., h_{\u03b2_c}(\u03b1\u2082)=1), then the color (2,\u03b1\u2082,\u03b2_c) is unique.\n  Proof. In column \u03b1\u2082, the only point above \u03b2_c is (\u03b1\u2082,Y) by definition of \u03b2_c, so r_U(\u03b1\u2082,\u03b2_c)=1. By hypothesis, s_U(\u03b1\u2082,\u03b2_c)=h_{\u03b2_c}(\u03b1\u2082)=1. By the type\u20132 multiplicity formula, (2,\u03b1\u2082,\u03b2_c) has multiplicity 1.\n  Why useful: When the top-row pivot (Theorem 10) fails, this is the next-in-line check on the first subrow of \u03b1\u2082 and yields uniqueness under a minimal, verifiable right-neighbor condition.\n\n- Lemma T2\u03b2 (right-column failure \u21d2 local type\u20132 at \u03b2\u2082\u2019s last left column if exactly one upper neighbor).\n  Setup. U has a unique maximal m=(X,Y). Let R={y<Y : (X,y)\u2208U}, assume R\u2260\u2205, and let \u03b2\u2082=max R. Assume row \u03b2\u2082 contains at least one point left of X and define \u03b1_r = max{ x<X : (x,\u03b2\u2082)\u2208U } (the rightmost sub-right-column point on row \u03b2\u2082). If in column \u03b1_r there is exactly one point above \u03b2\u2082 (i.e., v_{\u03b1_r}(\u03b2\u2082)=1), then the color (2,\u03b1_r,\u03b2\u2082) is unique.\n  Proof. On row \u03b2\u2082, the only point to the right of \u03b1_r is (X,\u03b2\u2082) by definition of \u03b1_r, hence s_U(\u03b1_r,\u03b2\u2082)=1. By hypothesis v_{\u03b1_r}(\u03b2\u2082)=1, so r_U(\u03b1_r,\u03b2\u2082)=1. The type\u20132 formula gives multiplicity 1 for (2,\u03b1_r,\u03b2\u2082).\n  Why useful: Dual to T2\u03b1; when the safe type\u20133 pivot (Theorem 3) at \u03b2\u2082 does not apply, this certifies uniqueness on the first left-ward base if the relevant column has a single upward extension.\n\nExamples (sanity checks)\n- For T2\u03b1. Let m=(8,8), top row has points at x=3,6,8 so \u03b1\u2082=6. Column 6 contains (6,5) and no other below 8, so \u03b2_c=5. Suppose row 5 has exactly one point to the right of 6, say (7,5), and no others to the right. Then r_U(6,5)=1 (only (6,8)), s_U(6,5)=1, so (2,6,5) is unique by T2\u03b1.\n- For T2\u03b2. Let m=(8,8), right column has points at y=4,7,8 so \u03b2\u2082=7. Row 7 contains (5,7) and (8,7), with column 5 having exactly one point above 7, say (5,9) absent (forbidden by O1) and (5,8) present? O1 forbids y>8; only (5,8) can be present above 7, so v_5(7)=1. Then s_U(5,7)=1 (only (8,7)), and (2,5,7) is unique by T2\u03b2.\n\nHow these plug into the unique\u2013maximal crossing subcase\n- Context. When both T and R are nonempty and neither pivot fires (Theorem 10 nor the safe type\u20133 singleton-row trigger), UM\u2013X and UM\u2013Y guarantee existence of SW-maxima meeting the x- or y-threshold separately. If a single SW-maximum meets both thresholds, Theorem 9 gives a type\u20131 unique color. Otherwise (crossing), the next checks are precisely T2\u03b1 and T2\u03b2 on the \u201cclosest\u201d subrow/column: \u03b2_c below \u03b1\u2082 and \u03b1_r left of \u03b2\u2082. If either h_{\u03b2_c}(\u03b1\u2082)=1 or v_{\u03b1_r}(\u03b2\u2082)=1, we immediately get a unique type\u20132 color.\n- What remains. The difficult residual is when both h_{\u03b2_c}(\u03b1\u2082)\u22652 and v_{\u03b1_r}(\u03b2\u2082)\u22652. I plan to show that then the lowest vertical/horizontal interlopers at these positions can be turned into either a robust L-corner (Theorem 7) or a singleton+extension trigger (Theorem 3) on some nearby row/column. This will complete the unique\u2013maximal case.\n\nObstacles and cautions\n- T2\u03b1/T2\u03b2 are sufficient but not necessary; they do not by themselves close the crossing subcase when both local counts are \u22652.\n- A na\u00efve attempt to force Theorem 7 at the \u201ccrossing L-corner\u201d (x(s_g),y(s_{g+1})) fails without controlling intermediate points on the relevant column/row segments. The nearest-interloper analysis is therefore essential.\n\nNext steps (concrete and auditable)\n1) Prove a nearest-interloper lemma for the crossing subcase: if both h_{\u03b2_c}(\u03b1\u2082)\u22652 and v_{\u03b1_r}(\u03b2\u2082)\u22652, then among the nearest interlopers one induces either (i) a robust L-corner (Theorem 7) or (ii) a singleton+extension (Theorem 3) or (iii) a row/column-of-two with globally unique base (R4/R3). I will formalize the minimality choices and verify that additional contributors cannot create a second witness for the same color.\n2) Curate Lemmas T2\u03b1 and T2\u03b2 into output.md under \u201cUnique\u2013maximal: boundary-local type\u20132 triggers.\u201d They are direct from the type\u20132 formula and strengthen the practical checklist after the pivots fail.\n3) Optional: add a brief remark in output.md clarifying Theorem 11\u2019s notation (replace \u201cv(\u03b2)=1\u201d by \u201cT_3(\u03b2)=1\u201d or \u201cv_\u03b1(\u03b2)=1\u201d).\n\nWhy this is progress\n- T2\u03b1 and T2\u03b2 are clean, checkable uniqueness certificates targeted at the unique\u2013maximal regime\u2019s remaining hard zone (post-pivot, pre-crossing resolution). They are immediate to implement in the search and reduce many configurations without global casework. The planned nearest-interloper lemma will dovetail with these to finish the unique\u2013maximal case."
