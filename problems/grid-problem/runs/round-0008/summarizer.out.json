  "summary_md": "Audit found no new gaps in the curated Theorems 1\u201311; Theorem 11 (|U|=4) is sound after the switch to Theorem 7. Two new lemmas strengthen the unique\u2013maximal toolkit: UM2\u2032 (a SW-max p that also touches both top/right boundaries forces a unique type\u20132 color) and Theorem UM-single (if the down-left region under the unique maximal m has exactly one product-order maximal p then G[U] has a unique color), proved by a case split using pivots/thresholds and existing lemmas. A symmetric robust L-corner RL\u2032 was proposed. Prover-02 added two boundary-local type\u20132 triggers T2\u03b1 and T2\u03b2 that act immediately after pivot failures and simplify the crossing analysis. The remaining hard case is |Max(S)|\u22652 (crossing pairs); the author plans a nearest-interloper lemma that either produces a clean L-corner (Theorem 7) or converts an interloper into a safe singleton/extension or R3/R4 witness. Verifier verdict: partial success. Files relied on: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json.",

    "No new gaps in Theorems 1\u201311; Theorem 11 fixed and now consistent after using Theorem 7.",
    "Lemma UM2\u2032: a SW-max p with both boundary contacts ((\u03b1,Y) and (X,\u03b2) \u2208 U) yields r_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)=s_U(\u03b1,\u03b2)=1, so (2,\u03b1,\u03b2) is unique (uses UM1 + type\u20132 formula).",
    "Theorem UM-single: when U has unique maximal m and Max(S) = {p}, a case analysis (A\u2013F using pivots/thresholds and UM\u2013X/UM\u2013Y) guarantees a uniquely colored edge in G[U].",
    "Lemma RL\u2032 (column-dual robust L-corner) presented: an L-shaped 2+2 pattern with a clean row gives a unique type\u20132 \u2014 useful as an off-the-shelf certificate.",
    "Two boundary-local lemmas T2\u03b1 and T2\u03b2 (top-row/right-column failure \u21d2 local unique type\u20132) were added and plug directly into the pivot-or-corner workflow for the crossing subcase.",
    "Planned nearest-interloper strategy: for crossing pairs (|Max(S)|\u22652) either (i) the corner is clean \u21d2 Theorem 7 applies, or (ii) a nearest interloper yields a safe trigger (Theorem 3, R3/R4); main obstacle is global isolation of the witness."

    "Prove the nearest-interloper lemma for the crossing pair (s_g, s_{g+1}): show that at least one nearest interloper yields a robust L-corner or a safe singleton/extension/R3/R4 trigger, thereby closing the |Max(S)|\u22652 unique\u2013maximal case.",
    "Stress-test UM-single and UM2\u2032 on crafted examples (dense boundaries / sparse interiors) and tidy minor notation issues (e.g., replace v(\u03b2)=1 by T_3(\u03b2)=1 or v_\u03b1(\u03b2)=1) before finalizing the unique-maximal \u21d2 unique-color theorem."
