### Audit of output.md (this round)
- No new gaps found in the currently curated Theorems 1–11 and auxiliary lemmas O1, UM1, R3, R4. The proof of Theorem 11 (|U|=4) is now sound after the fix via Theorem 7. 
- Minor note (not an error): Theorem 6’s last bullet is still terse (the “remaining permutations” assertion). It is acceptable as curated, but could be expanded later by explicitly identifying the consecutive x-order pair yielding r=s=1.

### New rigorous lemmas (ready to curate) — strengthening the unique–maximal toolkit

1) Lemma UM2′ (SW-max with both boundary contacts ⇒ unique type 2)
Statement. Let U have a unique maximal element m=(X,Y). Let S={p∈U: p_x<X and p_y<Y} and let Max(S) be its product-order maximal elements. If p=(α,β)∈Max(S) and both boundary-aligned points (α,Y)∈U and (X,β)∈U exist, then the color (2,α,β) occurs exactly once in G[U].
Proof. By Lemma UM1 (in output.md), there is no (α,y) with β<y<Y and no (x,β) with α<x<X. Thus r_U(α,β)=1 (the unique point above β in column α is (α,Y)) and s_U(α,β)=1 (the unique point to the right of α in row β is (X,β)). By the type–2 multiplicity formula (Theorem 1), the color (2,α,β) is unique. ∎
Why useful: This is a sharp, local certificate for unique type–2 in the unique–maximal regime that does not require threshold conditions. It complements Theorem 9 (type–1 via thresholds) and Theorem 10 (top-row pivot), and is often easy to verify in practice.

2) Theorem UM-single (unique maximal with a single SW-max ⇒ a unique color)
Statement. Suppose U has a unique maximal element m=(X,Y), and S={p∈U: p_x<X and p_y<Y} is nonempty but has a single product-order maximal element: Max(S)={p} with p=(α,β). Then G[U] has a uniquely colored edge.
Proof. Let T={x<X : (x,Y)∈U}, and if T≠∅ set α₂=max T; let R={y<Y : (X,y)∈U}, and if R≠∅ set β₂=max R. We split into cases.
- Case A: T=∅ and R=∅. Then there are no top-row or right-column points other than m. By UM1, any NE neighbor of p must lie on the top row or right column; hence p’s only NE neighbor is m, so the type–1 color (1,α,β) is unique by Theorem 1 (type 1 multiplicity).
- Case B: T≠∅ and the top-row pivot fires. If column α₂ contains no point below Y, Theorem 10 gives a unique type–4 color; we are done.
- Case C: R≠∅ and the safe column pivot fires. If row β₂ is a singleton {(X,β₂)}, then by Theorem 3 (singleton+extension) the color (3,β₂) is unique; we are done.
- Case D: T≠∅, the top-row pivot fails (so column α₂ contains some (α₂,β′) with β′<Y), and R=∅. By Lemma UM–X (proved in notes.md), since the pivot failed and Max(S)={p}, we have p_x≥α₂. Because R=∅, there is no (X,y) with y<Y. By UM1, any NE neighbor of p lies on the top row or right column; the right column contributes no NE neighbor (R=∅), and on the top row every point obeys x≤α₂≤p_x, so none lie strictly to the right of p. Thus p’s only NE neighbor is m, and (1,α,β) is unique.
- Case E: R≠∅, the safe column pivot fails (row β₂ has an additional point (α′,β₂) with α′<X), and T=∅. By Lemma UM–Y (proved in notes.md), since the pivot failed and Max(S)={p}, we have p_y≥β₂. Because T=∅, there are no top-row points other than m. By UM1, all NE neighbors of p must lie on the top row or right column; the top row contributes none (T=∅), and the right column has no point strictly above p_y other than m because p_y≥β₂=max{y<Y:(X,y)∈U}. Hence p’s only NE neighbor is m, and (1,α,β) is unique.
- Case F: T≠∅ and R≠∅, and neither pivot fires. Then by UM–X and UM–Y (notes.md) and Max(S)={p}, we get p_x≥α₂ and p_y≥β₂. Theorem 9 applies, showing p has exactly one NE neighbor (m), so (1,α,β) is unique.
These cases exhaust all possibilities. ∎
Why useful: This cleanly resolves the unique–maximal regime whenever S has a single maximal element. It collapses many subcases into threshold/pivot checks and reduces the remaining difficulty to configurations with |Max(S)|≥2.

Remark. In several subcases above, if both (α,Y) and (X,β) happen to lie in U, Lemma UM2′ immediately gives a unique type–2 color at (2,α,β) without invoking thresholds.

### Examples validating the new lemmas
- UM2′ example. Let U contain m=(7,7), p=(3,2), and also (3,7),(7,2); assume no points on the open vertical segment x=3, y∈(2,7), nor on the open horizontal segment y=2, x∈(3,7) (these are excluded by p∈Max(S) via UM1). Then r_U(3,2)=s_U(3,2)=1, so (2,3,2) is unique.
- UM-single, Case D. U has m=(8,8), top-row points at x=2,5,6 (α₂=6) and no right-column points below Y. Let S contain points strictly SW, and suppose Max(S)={p=(6,1)}. The top-row pivot fails since column 6 has (6,1). UM–X yields p_x≥α₂=6; with R=∅, p’s only NE neighbor is m, so (1,6,1) is unique.
- UM-single, Case F. U has m=(6,6), top-row x’s {2,4,5} (α₂=5), right-column y’s {1,3} (β₂=3), and Max(S)={p=(5,3)}. Both pivots fail. Since p meets both thresholds, Theorem 9 gives (1,5,3) unique.

### A small symmetric pattern (robust L-corner variant; optional to curate)
Lemma RL′ (two 2-point columns sharing a lower endpoint with a clean row ⇒ unique type 2).
- Statement. Suppose there exist α<α′ and β<β_1,β_2 such that in column α we have exactly (α,β),(α,β_1), in column α′ we have exactly (α′,β),(α′,β_2), and row β contains exactly the two points (α,β),(α′,β). Then (2,α,β) is unique.
- Proof. In column α there is exactly one point above β, namely (α,β_1), so r_U(α,β)=1. In row β there is exactly one point to the right of α, namely (α′,β), so s_U(α,β)=1. Theorem 1 (type 2) yields uniqueness. ∎
- Why useful: This is the column-dual of Lemma RL recorded in notes.md. Both are robust instances of Theorem 7 and are convenient “off-the-shelf” certificates in 2+2(+…) patterns.

### How this advances the overall proof
- Theorem UM-single settles the unique–maximal regime whenever the down-left region under m has a single maximal element. Together with Theorems 8–10, this eliminates a large family of layouts. What remains in the unique–maximal regime is the |Max(S)|≥2 case, for which the planned “crossing-pair” analysis applies.
- Lemma UM2′ adds a simple, verifiable trigger for unique type–2 localized at any SW-maximal p having both boundary contacts; it will be a key branch in the crossing analysis when both nearest boundary supports exist.

### Toward the remaining hard case (|Max(S)| ≥ 2): blueprint recap and refinement
- Setup. With m=(X,Y), list Max(S) in increasing x (hence decreasing y) as s_1,…,s_k, k≥2. If both T and R are nonempty and neither pivot fires, notes.md (UM–X/UM–Y corollary) yields indices f,g with x(s_f)≥α₂ and y(s_g)≥β₂ but no single s_i meets both. Then f>g. Consider the “crossing L-corner” at (x(s_g), y(s_{g+1})).
- Clean corner ⇒ unique type 2. If the open vertical segment x=x(s_g), y∈(y(s_{g+1}), y(s_g)) and the open horizontal segment y=y(s_{g+1}), x∈(x(s_g), x(s_{g+1})) are both empty, Theorem 7/D′ gives a unique type–2 color (2, x(s_g), y(s_{g+1})).
- Next target (nearest-interloper lemma). Define y_v as the minimum y in (y(s_{g+1}),Y) with (x(s_g),y)∈U if any; define x_h as the minimum x in (x(s_g),X) with (x,y(s_{g+1}))∈U if any. I will prove next that at least one of the nearest interlopers (if present) can be converted into a safe type–3/4 uniqueness via Theorem 3 or R3/R4, or else the corner is clean and Theorem 7 applies. This will close the |Max(S)|≥2 unique–maximal case.

### Obstacles
- The nearest-interloper conversion requires careful global control to ensure no other rows/columns contribute to T_3/T_4 outside the intended witness (hence the use of R3/R4, not just a raw vertical/horizontal edge). The construction must leverage that offenders for different consecutive maxima lie on disjoint rows and columns, allowing us to isolate a globally unique base.

### Next steps (concrete and auditable)
1) Curate Lemma UM2′ and Theorem UM-single into output.md (both are short and rely only on UM1 and Theorems 1, 3, 9, 10 and UM–X/UM–Y already proved in notes.md).
2) Prove the “nearest-interloper lemma” for the crossing pair (s_g, s_{g+1}): at least one of y_v or x_h enforces a safe R3/R4 or Theorem 3 trigger; otherwise the corner is clean and Theorem 7 applies. I will present the exact statement and proof next round.
3) Optional: curate RL′ (column-dual robust L-corner) as a pattern in notes.md for use in the crossing analysis.
4) Stress-test UM-single and UM2′ on crafted examples (dense boundaries; sparse interiors) and begin assembling a complete “unique maximal ⇒ unique color” theorem using the pivot-or-corner strategy.

### Why this is progress
- UM2′ adds a robust, local type–2 certificate directly at SW-maxima; UM-single settles the entire unique–maximal regime when the SW region has a single maximal, further shrinking the open set of configurations. The blueprint for the remaining |Max(S)|≥2 case is sharpened to a concrete nearest-interloper analysis aligned with the safe global triggers already curated (Theorem 3, R3, R4, Theorem 7).

Round 0008 — incremental, auditable progress

Overview
- I focus on consolidating the unique–maximal regime by adding two safe, local type–2 triggers tied to the boundary thresholds α₂ (top row) and β₂ (right column). These are immediate consequences of the type–2 multiplicity formula and fit the “pivot-or-corner” strategy. I also audit output.md: no new gaps found; minor notational point noted below. Finally, I outline how these triggers integrate into the crossing subcase and propose concrete next steps.

Audit of output.md (gaps or issues)
- Theorem 11: The corrected proof for |U|=4 looks consistent after switching to Theorem 7 (robust L-corner) in the two-rows-with-common-left-endpoint subcase.
- Theorem 8: Notation uses X,Y for the designated column/row; the proof is fine. The sentence “there are no β>Y in U when m is the unique maximal” only appears in Theorem 10 and is justified by Lemma O1.
- Minor notation: in the last paragraph of Theorem 11, “v(β)=1” should read v_α(β)=1 or directly “T_3(β)=1” to match earlier notation (purely cosmetic).

New, rigorously stated lemmas (safe triggers; immediate from the type–2 formula)

- Lemma T2α (top-row failure ⇒ local type–2 at α₂’s first subrow if exactly one right neighbor).
  Setup. U has a unique maximal m=(X,Y). Let T={x<X : (x,Y)∈U}, assume T≠∅, and let α₂=max T. Assume column α₂ contains at least one point below Y and define β_c = max{ y<Y : (α₂,y)∈U } (the highest sub-top-row point in column α₂). If on row β_c there is exactly one point to the right of α₂ (i.e., h_{β_c}(α₂)=1), then the color (2,α₂,β_c) is unique.
  Proof. In column α₂, the only point above β_c is (α₂,Y) by definition of β_c, so r_U(α₂,β_c)=1. By hypothesis, s_U(α₂,β_c)=h_{β_c}(α₂)=1. By the type–2 multiplicity formula, (2,α₂,β_c) has multiplicity 1.
  Why useful: When the top-row pivot (Theorem 10) fails, this is the next-in-line check on the first subrow of α₂ and yields uniqueness under a minimal, verifiable right-neighbor condition.

- Lemma T2β (right-column failure ⇒ local type–2 at β₂’s last left column if exactly one upper neighbor).
  Setup. U has a unique maximal m=(X,Y). Let R={y<Y : (X,y)∈U}, assume R≠∅, and let β₂=max R. Assume row β₂ contains at least one point left of X and define α_r = max{ x<X : (x,β₂)∈U } (the rightmost sub-right-column point on row β₂). If in column α_r there is exactly one point above β₂ (i.e., v_{α_r}(β₂)=1), then the color (2,α_r,β₂) is unique.
  Proof. On row β₂, the only point to the right of α_r is (X,β₂) by definition of α_r, hence s_U(α_r,β₂)=1. By hypothesis v_{α_r}(β₂)=1, so r_U(α_r,β₂)=1. The type–2 formula gives multiplicity 1 for (2,α_r,β₂).
  Why useful: Dual to T2α; when the safe type–3 pivot (Theorem 3) at β₂ does not apply, this certifies uniqueness on the first left-ward base if the relevant column has a single upward extension.

Examples (sanity checks)
- For T2α. Let m=(8,8), top row has points at x=3,6,8 so α₂=6. Column 6 contains (6,5) and no other below 8, so β_c=5. Suppose row 5 has exactly one point to the right of 6, say (7,5), and no others to the right. Then r_U(6,5)=1 (only (6,8)), s_U(6,5)=1, so (2,6,5) is unique by T2α.
- For T2β. Let m=(8,8), right column has points at y=4,7,8 so β₂=7. Row 7 contains (5,7) and (8,7), with column 5 having exactly one point above 7, say (5,9) absent (forbidden by O1) and (5,8) present? O1 forbids y>8; only (5,8) can be present above 7, so v_5(7)=1. Then s_U(5,7)=1 (only (8,7)), and (2,5,7) is unique by T2β.

How these plug into the unique–maximal crossing subcase
- Context. When both T and R are nonempty and neither pivot fires (Theorem 10 nor the safe type–3 singleton-row trigger), UM–X and UM–Y guarantee existence of SW-maxima meeting the x- or y-threshold separately. If a single SW-maximum meets both thresholds, Theorem 9 gives a type–1 unique color. Otherwise (crossing), the next checks are precisely T2α and T2β on the “closest” subrow/column: β_c below α₂ and α_r left of β₂. If either h_{β_c}(α₂)=1 or v_{α_r}(β₂)=1, we immediately get a unique type–2 color.
- What remains. The difficult residual is when both h_{β_c}(α₂)≥2 and v_{α_r}(β₂)≥2. I plan to show that then the lowest vertical/horizontal interlopers at these positions can be turned into either a robust L-corner (Theorem 7) or a singleton+extension trigger (Theorem 3) on some nearby row/column. This will complete the unique–maximal case.

Obstacles and cautions
- T2α/T2β are sufficient but not necessary; they do not by themselves close the crossing subcase when both local counts are ≥2.
- A naïve attempt to force Theorem 7 at the “crossing L-corner” (x(s_g),y(s_{g+1})) fails without controlling intermediate points on the relevant column/row segments. The nearest-interloper analysis is therefore essential.

Next steps (concrete and auditable)
1) Prove a nearest-interloper lemma for the crossing subcase: if both h_{β_c}(α₂)≥2 and v_{α_r}(β₂)≥2, then among the nearest interlopers one induces either (i) a robust L-corner (Theorem 7) or (ii) a singleton+extension (Theorem 3) or (iii) a row/column-of-two with globally unique base (R4/R3). I will formalize the minimality choices and verify that additional contributors cannot create a second witness for the same color.
2) Curate Lemmas T2α and T2β into output.md under “Unique–maximal: boundary-local type–2 triggers.” They are direct from the type–2 formula and strengthen the practical checklist after the pivots fail.
3) Optional: add a brief remark in output.md clarifying Theorem 11’s notation (replace “v(β)=1” by “T_3(β)=1” or “v_α(β)=1”).

Why this is progress
- T2α and T2β are clean, checkable uniqueness certificates targeted at the unique–maximal regime’s remaining hard zone (post-pivot, pre-crossing resolution). They are immediate to implement in the search and reduce many configurations without global casework. The planned nearest-interloper lemma will dovetail with these to finish the unique–maximal case.
