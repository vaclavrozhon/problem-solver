Audit found no new gaps in the curated Theorems 1–11; Theorem 11 (|U|=4) is sound after the switch to Theorem 7. Two new lemmas strengthen the unique–maximal toolkit: UM2′ (a SW-max p that also touches both top/right boundaries forces a unique type–2 color) and Theorem UM-single (if the down-left region under the unique maximal m has exactly one product-order maximal p then G[U] has a unique color), proved by a case split using pivots/thresholds and existing lemmas. A symmetric robust L-corner RL′ was proposed. Prover-02 added two boundary-local type–2 triggers T2α and T2β that act immediately after pivot failures and simplify the crossing analysis. The remaining hard case is |Max(S)|≥2 (crossing pairs); the author plans a nearest-interloper lemma that either produces a clean L-corner (Theorem 7) or converts an interloper into a safe singleton/extension or R3/R4 witness. Verifier verdict: partial success. Files relied on: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json.
