  "summary_md": "Audit found no new gaps in the curated Theorems 1–11; Theorem 11 (|U|=4) is sound after the switch to Theorem 7. Two new lemmas strengthen the unique–maximal toolkit: UM2′ (a SW-max p that also touches both top/right boundaries forces a unique type–2 color) and Theorem UM-single (if the down-left region under the unique maximal m has exactly one product-order maximal p then G[U] has a unique color), proved by a case split using pivots/thresholds and existing lemmas. A symmetric robust L-corner RL′ was proposed. Prover-02 added two boundary-local type–2 triggers T2α and T2β that act immediately after pivot failures and simplify the crossing analysis. The remaining hard case is |Max(S)|≥2 (crossing pairs); the author plans a nearest-interloper lemma that either produces a clean L-corner (Theorem 7) or converts an interloper into a safe singleton/extension or R3/R4 witness. Verifier verdict: partial success. Files relied on: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json.",
  "highlights": [
    "No new gaps in Theorems 1–11; Theorem 11 fixed and now consistent after using Theorem 7.",
    "Lemma UM2′: a SW-max p with both boundary contacts ((α,Y) and (X,β) ∈ U) yields r_U(α,β)=s_U(α,β)=1, so (2,α,β) is unique (uses UM1 + type–2 formula).",
    "Theorem UM-single: when U has unique maximal m and Max(S) = {p}, a case analysis (A–F using pivots/thresholds and UM–X/UM–Y) guarantees a uniquely colored edge in G[U].",
    "Lemma RL′ (column-dual robust L-corner) presented: an L-shaped 2+2 pattern with a clean row gives a unique type–2 — useful as an off-the-shelf certificate.",
    "Two boundary-local lemmas T2α and T2β (top-row/right-column failure ⇒ local unique type–2) were added and plug directly into the pivot-or-corner workflow for the crossing subcase.",
    "Planned nearest-interloper strategy: for crossing pairs (|Max(S)|≥2) either (i) the corner is clean ⇒ Theorem 7 applies, or (ii) a nearest interloper yields a safe trigger (Theorem 3, R3/R4); main obstacle is global isolation of the witness."

  "next_questions": [
    "Curate UM2′ and Theorem UM-single (and the T2α/T2β lemmas) into output.md and add the optional RL′ pattern to notes.md.",
    "Prove the nearest-interloper lemma for the crossing pair (s_g, s_{g+1}): show that at least one nearest interloper yields a robust L-corner or a safe singleton/extension/R3/R4 trigger, thereby closing the |Max(S)|≥2 unique–maximal case.",
    "Stress-test UM-single and UM2′ on crafted examples (dense boundaries / sparse interiors) and tidy minor notation issues (e.g., replace v(β)=1 by T_3(β)=1 or v_α(β)=1) before finalizing the unique-maximal ⇒ unique-color theorem."
