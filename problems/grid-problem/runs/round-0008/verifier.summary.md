Summary and audit
- Both provers focused on the unique–maximal regime and proposed short, local uniqueness certificates that dovetail with the existing pivot-or-corner framework. I checked each new claim against the multiplicity formulas (Theorem 1), O1 (coordinatewise maxima), and UM1 (NE neighbors of SW-maxima lie on the boundary). The statements UM2′ (boundary contacts at a SW-max ⇒ unique type 2), UM-single (|Max(S)|=1 ⇒ a unique color), and T2α/T2β (boundary-local type-2 triggers) are correct as stated and can be curated. They are nontrivial and useful.
- Minor phrasing issue in UM-single, Case D/E: the sentence about “every top-row point obeys x ≤ α₂ ≤ p_x” should be read as applying to top-row points other than m; m is allowed and is indeed the unique NE neighbor there. This does not affect correctness; I have rewritten the proof to avoid relying on UM–X/UM–Y and to be completely self-contained.
- The T2α/T2β lemmas are immediate consequences of the type-2 formula. They can be s
