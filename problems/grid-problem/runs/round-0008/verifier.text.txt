{"feedback_md":"Summary and audit\n- Both provers focused on the unique–maximal regime and proposed short, local uniqueness certificates that dovetail with the existing pivot-or-corner framework. I checked each new claim against the multiplicity formulas (Theorem 1), O1 (coordinatewise maxima), and UM1 (NE neighbors of SW-maxima lie on the boundary). The statements UM2′ (boundary contacts at a SW-max ⇒ unique type 2), UM-single (|Max(S)|=1 ⇒ a unique color), and T2α/T2β (boundary-local type-2 triggers) are correct as stated and can be curated. They are nontrivial and useful.\n- Minor phrasing issue in UM-single, Case D/E: the sentence about “every top-row point obeys x ≤ α₂ ≤ p_x” should be read as applying to top-row points other than m; m is allowed and is indeed the unique NE neighbor there. This does not affect correctness; I have rewritten the proof to avoid relying on UM–X/UM–Y and to be completely self-contained.\n- The T2α/T2β lemmas are immediate consequences of the type-2 formula. They can be seen as boundary-anchored instances of Theorem 7 (robust L-corner). They are accurate and safe. The example for T2β in the report informally invoked O1 to suggest (5,8) “must be present,” but the lemma itself already assumes v_{α_r}(β₂)=1, so the example is fine once we explicitly posit (5,8) ∈ U.\n- Optional RL′ (column-dual of the two-rows RL pattern) is also a direct instance of Theorem 7; I keep it in notes as pattern stock rather than elevating it to output.\n\nCuration decisions\n- I have appended to output.md: (i) Theorem 12 (UM2′), (ii) Theorem 13 (UM-single, with a self-contained proof), and (iii) Lemma 14 (T2α/T2β boundary-local type-2 triggers). All rely only on Theorems 1,3,7,9,10 and Lemmas O1, UM1 that are already curated.\n- No other changes to previously curated material were needed.\n\nPromising directions and concrete next steps\n1) Finish the unique–maximal case for |Max(S)| ≥ 2 via the “crossing-pair” analysis: index the SW-maxima s_1,…,s_k (x increasing, y decreasing), choose f,g with x(s_f) ≥ α₂ and y(s_g) ≥ β₂ but no single s_i meeting both; set the crossing corner c=(x(s_g), y(s_{g+1})). Prove a nearest-interloper lemma: if both the vertical segment above c and the horizontal segment to the right of c are populated, then at least one nearest interloper yields a unique color via either (a) a robust L-corner (Theorem 7) at c or a nearby corner, or (b) a singleton+extension trigger (Theorem 3), or (c) an R3/R4 global row/column-of-two trigger. Otherwise the corner is clean and Theorem 7 applies directly.\n2) When both local counts at α₂ and β₂ are ≥2 (h_{β_c}(α₂) ≥ 2 and v_{α_r}(β₂) ≥ 2), implement the minimality choices β_c and α_r, and prove that all potential extra contributors for T_3/T_4 live on disjoint rows/columns across consecutive maxima, letting you isolate a globally unique base (R3/R4). This is the key technical closure.\n3) Expand Theorem 6’s last subcase (permutation analysis) with an explicit identification of the consecutive x-order pair producing r=s=1, removing any terseness.\n4) Stress-test on staircase-with-boundary-fillers families to calibrate the nearest-interloper lemma and ensure all branches (Theorem 7 vs. 3 vs. R3/R4) are covered without overlap or gaps.\n\nNet assessment\n- We now have robust, local type-2 certificates at boundary-aligned positions and a full resolution of the unique–maximal regime when |Max(S)|=1. The remaining open work is the |Max(S)|≥2 crossing subcase; the blueprint and the exact minimality choices are in notes for the next round.","new_notes_md":"Unique–maximal: new local triggers and the |Max(S)|=1 closure\n\nDefinitions recap (unique–maximal regime). Assume U has a unique maximal m=(X,Y) in the product order. Define\n- T = { x<X : (x,Y)∈U }, α₂ = max T if T≠∅.\n- R = { y<Y : (X,y)∈U }, β₂ = max R if R≠∅.\n- S = { p∈U : p_x<X and p_y<Y }, and Max(S) its product-order maxima.\n\nNew local certificate at a SW-maximum (UM2′).\n- Lemma (UM2′). If p=(α,β)∈Max(S) and both boundary-aligned points (α,Y) and (X,β) lie in U, then the color (2,α,β) is unique. Reason: By UM1, column α has no points in (β,Y) and row β has no points in (α,X). O1 forbids points beyond the boundary. Thus r_U(α,β)=s_U(α,β)=1, and Theorem 1 (type 2) yields uniqueness.\n\nClosure when |Max(S)|=1 (UM-single).\n- Theorem (UM-single). If S≠∅ and Max(S)={p=(α,β)}, then G[U] has a uniquely colored edge. Sketch (casework):\n  • If T=R=∅, then by UM1 any NE neighbor of p lies on the boundary; since only m lies there, (1,α,β) is unique (type 1).\n  • If T≠∅ and column α₂ has no point below Y, Theorem 10 gives a unique type 4.\n  • If R≠∅ and row β₂ is a singleton {(X,β₂)}, Theorem 3 gives a unique type 3 (v_X(β₂)=1 holds automatically in this regime).\n  • If T≠∅, R=∅ and column α₂ has some (α₂,β′) with β′<Y, then q=(α₂,β′)∈S and the uniqueness of the maximal element forces p≥q, hence p_x≥α₂. By UM1, all NE neighbors of p lie on the boundary; the right column contributes none (R=∅) and, among top-row points other than m, all have x≤α₂≤p_x, so none lies to the right of p. Thus m is p’s only NE neighbor and (1,α,β) is unique.\n  • If T=∅, R≠∅ and row β₂ has some (α′,β₂) with α′<X, then similarly p_y≥β₂ and the only NE neighbor is m; (1,α,β) is unique.\n  • If T,R≠∅ and both pivots fail, pick q₁=(α₂,β′) with β′<Y and q₂=(α′,β₂) with α′<X; then p≥q₁,q₂ so p_x≥α₂ and p_y≥β₂. Theorem 9 applies and (1,α,β) is unique.\n\nBoundary-local type-2 triggers (first subrow/last left column).\n- T2α. If T≠∅, column α₂ has some point below Y, and β_c=max{ y<Y : (α₂,y)∈U }, then whenever row β_c has exactly one point to the right of α₂ (i.e., h_{β_c}(α₂)=1), the color (2,α₂,β_c) is unique (r=1 via (α₂,Y), s=1 by hypothesis).\n- T2β. If R≠∅, row β₂ has some point left of X, and α_r=max{ x<X : (x,β₂)∈U }, then whenever column α_r has exactly one point above β₂ (i.e., v_{α_r}(β₂)=1), the color (2,α_r,β₂) is unique (s=1 via (X,β₂), r=1 by hypothesis).\n\nPattern library (column-dual robust L-corner).\n- RL′. If columns α<α′ have exactly (α,β),(α,β₁) with β<β₁ and (α′,β),(α′,β₂) with β<β₂, and row β contains exactly (α,β),(α′,β), then (2,α,β) is unique. This is a direct instance of Theorem 7.\n\nCrossing subcase blueprint (|Max(S)|≥2; refined target for next round).\n- List s_1,…,s_k=Max(S) with x increasing, y decreasing. If both T,R≠∅ and neither pivot fires, there exist indices f,g with x(s_f)≥α₂ and y(s_g)≥β₂ but no single s_i meets both (hence f>g). Consider the crossing corner c=(x(s_g), y(s_{g+1})).\n  • If the open segments above/right of c are clean up to the boundary supports, Theorem 7 gives a unique type-2 at c.\n  • Otherwise, let y_v be the least y>y(s_{g+1}) with (x(s_g),y)∈U, and x_h the least x>x(s_g) with (x,y(s_{g+1}))∈U. The next lemma to prove: at least one of these nearest interlopers can be converted into a safe uniqueness via Theorem 3 (singleton+extension) or the global R3/R4 triggers; failing that, both segments are clean and Theorem 7 fires. The disjointness of the rows {y(s_{i+1})} and columns {x(s_i)} across i will be the key to isolating a globally unique base.\n\nEditorial note. In Theorem 11’s last paragraph, the phrase “v(β)=1” should read “T_3(β)=1” or “v_α(β)=1 for the unique contributing α”; this is purely notational.","new_notes_append":"True","new_outputs_md":"Theorems currently established (continued)\n12) Unique–maximal: SW–maximum with both boundary contacts ⇒ unique type 2.\n13) Unique–maximal with a single SW–maximum ⇒ some unique color exists.\n14) Unique–maximal: boundary-local type-2 triggers at α₂ and β₂.\n\nProofs (additions)\n\nTheorem 12 (Unique–maximal: SW–maximum with both boundary contacts ⇒ unique type 2).\nAssume U has a unique maximal element m=(X,Y). Let S={ p∈U : p_x<X and p_y<Y }, and let p=(α,β)∈Max(S). Suppose (α,Y)∈U and (X,β)∈U. By Lemma UM1, there is no point of U on the open vertical segment { (α,y) : β<y<Y } and no point on the open horizontal segment { (x,β) : α<x<X }. By Lemma O1 there are no points with y>Y or x>X. Hence r_U(α,β)=1 and s_U(α,β)=1. By Theorem 1 (type 2), the color (2,α,β) occurs exactly once in G[U].\n\nTheorem 13 (Unique–maximal with a single SW–maximum ⇒ a unique color exists).\nAssume U has a unique maximal m=(X,Y). Let S={ p∈U : p_x<X and p_y<Y } and suppose S≠∅ but Max(S)={p=(α,β)}.\nDefine T={ x<X : (x,Y)∈U } and, if T≠∅, α₂=max T. Define R={ y<Y : (X,y)∈U } and, if R≠∅, β₂=max R. We consider cases.\n- Case 1: T=∅ and R=∅. By Lemma UM1, any NE neighbor of p lies on the top row or right column; since m is the only point on either, m is the unique NE neighbor. By Theorem 1 (type 1), (1,α,β) has multiplicity 1.\n- Case 2: T≠∅ and column α₂ contains no point below Y. Then on row Y, h_Y(α₂)=1 and, by the definition of α₂ and Lemma O1, no other row contributes to T_4(α₂). Theorem 10 applies: (4,α₂) is unique.\n- Case 3: R≠∅ and row β₂ is a singleton {(X,β₂)}. In column X there is exactly one point above β₂, namely m, by the definition of β₂ and Lemma O1. By Theorem 3, (3,β₂) is unique.\n- Case 4: T≠∅, column α₂ contains some (α₂,β′) with β′<Y, and R=∅. Then q=(α₂,β′)∈S. Since p is the unique maximal of S, we have p≥q, hence p_x≥α₂. By Lemma UM1, any NE neighbor of p lies on the top row or the right column. The right column contributes none (R=∅). Among top-row points other than m, all have x≤α₂≤p_x and thus are not to the right of p. Therefore m is p’s only NE neighbor, and by Theorem 1 (type 1) the color (1,α,β) is unique.\n- Case 5: R≠∅, row β₂ contains some (α′,β₂) with α′<X, and T=∅. Then r=(α′,β₂)∈S and p≥r gives p_y≥β₂. By Lemma UM1, all NE neighbors of p lie on the top row or right column. The top row contributes none (T=∅). On the right column, by the definition of β₂ and Lemma O1 there is no point strictly above p_y other than m. Hence m is the only NE neighbor and (1,α,β) is unique.\n- Case 6: T≠∅ and R≠∅, with column α₂ containing some (α₂,β′) with β′<Y and row β₂ containing some (α′,β₂) with α′<X (i.e., both pivots fail). Then p≥(α₂,β′) and p≥(α′,β₂), so p_x≥α₂ and p_y≥β₂. Theorem 9 applies: p has exactly one NE neighbor (m), hence (1,α,β) is unique.\nThese cases are exhaustive; in all cases a uniquely colored edge exists.\n\nLemma 14 (Boundary-local type-2 triggers at α₂ and β₂).\nAssume U has a unique maximal m=(X,Y).\n(a) Suppose T≠∅ and column α₂ contains at least one point below Y. Let β_c=max{ y<Y : (α₂,y)∈U }. If row β_c has exactly one point to the right of α₂ (i.e., h_{β_c}(α₂)=1), then the color (2,α₂,β_c) is unique.\nProof. In column α₂ the only point above β_c is (α₂,Y) by the choice of β_c and Lemma O1, so r_U(α₂,β_c)=1. By hypothesis s_U(α₂,β_c)=h_{β_c}(α₂)=1. By Theorem 1 (type 2), (2,α₂,β_c) has multiplicity 1.\n(b) Suppose R≠∅ and row β₂ contains at least one point left of X. Let α_r=max{ x<X : (x,β₂)∈U }. If column α_r has exactly one point above β₂ (i.e., v_{α_r}(β₂)=1), then the color (2,α_r,β₂) is unique.\nProof. On row β₂ the only point to the right of α_r is (X,β₂) by the choice of α_r and Lemma O1, so s_U(α_r,β₂)=1. By hypothesis r_U(α_r,β₂)=v_{α_r}(β₂)=1. Theorem 1 (type 2) yields uniqueness.\n\nRemarks. Lemma 14(a,b) are boundary-anchored instances of Theorem 7 (robust L-corner), specialized to the first subrow below (α₂,Y) and the last left column before (X,β₂), respectively. They are particularly effective when the primary pivots (Theorems 10 and 3) fail but these first substructures are minimally “clean.”","new_outputs_append":"True","verdict":"partial success"}
