It should read \u201cthere is a unique column \u03b1 with (\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2208U and v_\u03b1(\u03b2)=1, hence T_3(\u03b2)=1.\u201d This is purely cosmetic; the argument is correct because in that subcase every row has exactly one point, so exactly one column \u03b1 has (\u03b1,\u03b2) and that column has exactly one point above \u03b2.\n- Duplication: The \u201cSetup and notation\u201d and Theorems 1\u201311 appear twice in the curated output segment. This is editorial only; no logical conflict.\n- Theorems 12\u201314: I rechecked each against Theorems 1, 3, 7, 9\u201310, O1 and UM1. All are sound as stated.\n\n### New, rigorously stated micro-lemmas (safe, immediate from multiplicity formulas)\n\n- Lemma S4gen (generalized row-base uniqueness for type 4).\n  Statement. Fix \u03b1. If there exists a row \u03b20 with (\u03b1,\u03b20)\u2208U and h_{\u03b20}(\u03b1)=1, and for every \u03b2\u2260\u03b20 with (\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2208U we have h_\u03b2(\u03b1)=0, then T_4(\u03b1)=1 and (4,\u03b1) is unique.\n  Proof. By Theorem 1 (type 4), T_4(\u03b1)=\u2211_\u03b2 1_{(\u03b1,\u03b2)}\u00b7h_\u03b2(\u03b1)=h_{\u03b20}(\u03b1)=1.\n  Why useful. A direct generalization of R4; it allows multiple occurrences of (\u03b1,\u00b7) provided only one row contributes and that contribution equals 1.\n\n- Lemma S3gen (generalized column-base uniqueness for type 3; dual of S4gen).\n  Statement. Fix \u03b2. If there exists a column \u03b10 with (\u03b10,\u03b2)\u2208U and v_{\u03b10}(\u03b2)=1, and for every \u03b1\u2260\u03b10 with (\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2208U we have v_\u03b1(\u03b2)=0, then T_3(\u03b2)=1 and (3,\u03b2) is unique.\n  Proof. By Theorem 1 (type 3), T_3(\u03b2)=\u2211_\u03b1 1_{(\u03b1,\u03b2)}\u00b7v_\u03b1(\u03b2)=v_{\u03b10}(\u03b2)=1.\n  Why useful. A direct generalization of R3; it tolerates multiple occurrences of the base row \u03b2 as long as only one column contributes and contributes 1.\n\n- Lemma RLclean+ (two 2-point rows with shared left endpoint and clean shared column \u21d2 unique type 2, robust to extra points off the shared column).\n  Statement. Suppose U contains two distinct rows \u03b2_1<\u03b2_2 with points {(\u03b1,\u03b2_i),(\u03b3_i,\u03b2_i)} and \u03b1<\u03b3_i (i=1,2); assume further that column \u03b1 contains exactly the two points (\u03b1,\u03b2_1),(\u03b1,\u03b2_2). Then color (2,\u03b1,\u03b2_1) is unique.\n  Proof. On column \u03b1, the only point above \u03b2_1 is (\u03b1,\u03b2_2), so r_U(\u03b1,\u03b2_1)=1. On row \u03b2_1, the only point to the right of \u03b1 is (\u03b3_1,\u03b2_1), so s_U(\u03b1,\u03b2_1)=1. Theorem 1 (type 2) gives uniqueness.\n  Why useful. This packages a frequent 2+2 pattern and is stable under arbitrary extra points off column \u03b1.\n\n### Partial classification for |U|=5 (curatable subcases with complete proofs)\nWe advance the small-case frontier by handling three row-occupancy patterns. Let |U|=5.\n\n- Pattern 4+1 (some row has 4 points). Let that row be y0 with x_1<x_2<x_3<x_4. Within the row, (4,x_3) occurs exactly once. Any additional occurrence of (4,x_3) would require another row \u03b2 to contain both (x_3,\u03b2) and some (x> x_3,\u03b2). But only one point lies off y0, so no such \u03b2 exists. Hence T_4(x_3)=1 (unique type 4).\n\n- Pattern 3+1+1 (some row has 3 points; the other two rows are singletons). Let the 3-point row be y0 with x_1<x_2<x_3. Within that row, (4,x_2) occurs exactly once. Any other row \u03b2 with (x_2,\u03b2) is a singleton, so h_\u03b2(x_2)=0 and contributes nothing to T_4(x_2). Therefore T_4(x_2)=1 (unique type 4) by Theorem 1.\n\n- Pattern 3+2 (two rows, one with 3 points, the other with 2). Let the 3-point row be y0 with x_1<x_2<x_3, and the 2-point row be y1 with points (\u03b1, y1),(\u03b3, y1), \u03b1<\u03b3. If \u03b1\u2260x_2, then as in 3+1+1, (4,x_2) is unique: the only potential duplicator row would need two off-row points with left base x_2; but both off-row points lie on y1, and by assumption y1\u2019s left base is \u03b1\u2260x_2. If \u03b1=x_2, then column \u03b1 contains exactly (\u03b1,y0),(\u03b1,y1) and on row y1 there is exactly one point to the right of \u03b1, namely (\u03b3,y1). Hence r_U(\u03b1,y1)=s_U(\u03b1,y1)=1, and (2,\u03b1,y1) is unique by Theorem 1 (type 2). Thus, in all 3+2 configurations, a unique color exists.\n\nRemarks. The 3+2 resolution is robust: in the \u201cshared left endpoint\u201d subcase it is exactly the robust L-corner at (\u03b1,y1); in the other subcase, the unique type-4 on the 3-point row survives because two off-row points cannot assemble an additional (4,x_2) color with only one row available.\n\n### Examples and sanity checks\n- S4gen in action. U has (\u03b1,\u03b20),(\u03b1,\u03b21),(\u03b1,\u03b22) with h_{\u03b20}(\u03b1)=1 and h_{\u03b21}(\u03b1)=h_{\u03b22}(\u03b1)=0. Then T_4(\u03b1)=1 by S4gen; the unique edge is horizontal on row \u03b20 with left endpoint \u03b1.\n- 3+2 shared-left example. U contains y0: (2,5),(5,5),(7,5) and y1: (5,2),(9,2). Column 5 has exactly (5,5),(5,2); on row 2 the only right neighbor of 5 is 9. Hence (2,5,2) is unique.\n- 3+2 non-shared-left example. U contains y0: (2,5),(5,5),(7,5) and y1: (3,2),(9,2). Then (4,5) is unique: on row 5 it occurs once; no other row has left base 5 with a right neighbor, as y1\u2019s left base is 3.\n\n### Obstacles and why some attempts fail\n- Extending 2+2+1 fully. If two 2-point rows share a left endpoint \u03b1 and the 5th point also lies in column \u03b1, the clean-column hypothesis of RLclean+ fails (r_U(\u03b1,\u03b2_low)\u22652). Neither Theorem 7 nor S4gen/S3gen applies automatically. A different trigger (e.g., a boundary-local type-2 at \u03b1\u2082 or \u03b2\u2082, or a singleton+extension on a different row/column) must be extracted. This motivates the nearest-interloper analysis in the unique\u2013maximal regime and a refined 2+2(+1) pattern lemma.\n- Crossing subcase under unique\u2013maximality. When both T2\u03b1 and T2\u03b2 fail (h_{\u03b2_c}(\u03b1\u2082)\u22652 and v_{\u03b1_r}(\u03b2\u2082)\u22652), a na\u00efve choice of the crossing corner c=(x(s_g),y(s_{g+1})) need not satisfy D\u2032 (there may be interlopers on both rays), and neither type-3/4 triggers fire without additional global control. A nearest-interloper lemma is needed to convert the closest vertical/horizontal interlopers into a safe R3/R4 or Theorem 3 witness; I will prove this next.\n\n### Next steps (concrete and auditable)\n1) Curate S4gen and S3gen into the auxiliary lemmas section (they are direct corollaries of Theorem 1) and RLclean+ as a robust instance of Theorem 7; these strengthen the pattern library without new prerequisites.\n2) Complete the |U|=5 classification by handling the remaining patterns 2+2+1, 2+1+1+1, and 1+1+1+1+1. The 2+1+1+1 and 1+1+1+1+1 patterns should follow quickly from existing tools (Theorems 4, 7, 11-style arguments); 2+2+1 requires careful treatment when the extra point lies in a shared column.\n3) Prove a nearest-interloper lemma for the unique\u2013maximal crossing subcase: with s_g,s_{g+1} and c=(x(s_g),y(s_{g+1})), define the nearest vertical interloper y_v and nearest horizontal interloper x_h. Show that if both exist, then either (i) c is a robust L-corner (Theorem 7) or (ii) one of rows y_v / columns x_h satisfies S4gen/S3gen (hence a unique type-4/3), or (iii) a boundary-local type-2 (Lemma 14) fires at (\u03b1\u2082,\u03b2_c) or (\u03b1_r,\u03b2\u2082). This will close the unique\u2013maximal regime.\n4) Editorial: de-duplicate repeated sections in output.md and fix the \u201cv(\u03b2)=1\u201d notation in Theorem 11.\n\n### Why this is progress\n- The new lemmas S4gen/S3gen broaden the applicability of type-3/4 certificates in global settings and will be useful when interlopers prevent D\u2032 but contributions aggregate to a single base.\n- The 3+2 and 3+1+1 patterns for |U|=5 are now settled with short, verifiable proofs; the 4+1 pattern is also covered. This materially advances small-case verification and stress-tests the trigger library.\n- The identified hard subcases and the stated nearest-interloper plan provide a clear, checkable path to finish both the unique\u2013maximal crossing regime and the remaining 2+2+1 pattern."
