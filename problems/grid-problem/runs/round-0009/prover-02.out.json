The subsequent \u201cso T_3(\u03b2)=1\u201d makes the intended meaning clear; still, a cosmetic fix is recommended.\n- D\u2032 (the \u201cexplicit consecutive-maxima L-corner\u201d formulated via emptiness of open segments) does not appear in output.md; this is good. As noted earlier in notes.md, an emptiness-only condition between consecutive maxima is not sufficient to guarantee r_U=s_U=1, because top-row/right-column contributions can inflate counts. Any curated specialization should be stated directly in terms of the global counts R_i and S_i (Theorem 5) or via Theorem 7\u2019s exact r=s=1 hypotheses.\n- Newly curated Theorems 12\u201314 (UM2\u2032, UM-single, and the boundary-local type\u20132 triggers) are correct and strengthen the unique\u2013maximal toolkit. No logical gaps detected.\n\nNew, rigorously stated result (small-case milestone)\nProposition P5 (Every |U|=5 admits a uniquely colored edge).\nStatement. If U\u2286[n]\u00d7[n] has |U|=5, then G[U] contains an edge whose color appears exactly once in G[U].\nProof (complete case analysis by row occupancy).\nLet the multiset of row-occupancies be one of: 5; 4+1; 3+2; 3+1+1; 2+2+1; 2+1+1+1; 1+1+1+1+1.\n- Case 5 (single row). By Theorem 2 (single-line), the rightmost edge has unique color (4,x_{4}).\n- Case 4+1. On the 4-point row with x_1<x_2<x_3<x_4, the color (4,x_3) occurs once on that row. Any second occurrence elsewhere would require some other row to contain both (x_3,\u00b7) and a point to its right. With only one point off the 4-point row, this is impossible. Hence (4,x_3) is unique.\n- Case 3+2. Let row \u03b2 have three points at x_1<x_2<x_3, and row \u03b2\u2032 have two points at \u03b1<\u03b3.\n  \u2022 If \u03b1\u2260x_2, then only row \u03b2 contains (x_2,\u00b7) together with a right neighbor, so T_4(x_2)=1 and (4,x_2) is unique (Theorem 1, type 4).\n  \u2022 If \u03b1=x_2, the two rows share the same left endpoint x_2. Let \u03b2_low be the smaller of {\u03b2,\u03b2\u2032}. Then on row \u03b2_low there is exactly one point to the right of \u03b1 (it is a 2-point row), and in column \u03b1 there is exactly one point above \u03b2_low (the other row\u2019s point at \u03b1). By Theorem 7 (robust L-corner), r_U(\u03b1,\u03b2_low)=s_U(\u03b1,\u03b2_low)=1 and the color (2,\u03b1,\u03b2_low) is unique.\n- Case 3+1+1. On the 3-point row with x_1<x_2<x_3, color (4,x_2) occurs once on that row. Any other row is a singleton, so no other row contributes to T_4(x_2). Thus T_4(x_2)=1 and (4,x_2) is unique.\n- Case 2+2+1. Let the 2-point rows be \u03b2_1,\u03b2_2 with left endpoints \u03b1_1<\u03b3_1 on \u03b2_1 and \u03b1_2<\u03b3_2 on \u03b2_2.\n  \u2022 If \u03b1_1=\u03b1_2=:\u03b1, then column \u03b1 contains exactly the two points on \u03b2_1,\u03b2_2, and the lower row \u03b2_low is a 2-point row. Hence r_U(\u03b1,\u03b2_low)=s_U(\u03b1,\u03b2_low)=1 and (2,\u03b1,\u03b2_low) is unique by Theorem 7.\n  \u2022 If \u03b1_1\u2260\u03b1_2, pick \u03b1 among {\u03b1_1,\u03b1_2}. Only its own row contains (\u03b1,\u00b7) together with a right neighbor; the other 2-point row has different left endpoint, and the remaining row is a singleton. Therefore T_4(\u03b1)=1 (Theorem 1, type 4), yielding a unique (4,\u03b1).\n- Case 2+1+1+1. Let the 2-point row have left endpoint \u03b1. No other row has two points, so no other row contributes to T_4(\u03b1). Therefore T_4(\u03b1)=1 and (4,\u03b1) is unique.\n- Case 1+1+1+1+1. If some column contains two points with lower y=\u03b2, then that column is the only one meeting row \u03b2 (all rows are singletons), so T_3(\u03b2)=1 by Theorem 1 (type 3) and (3,\u03b2) is unique. If no column contains two points either, U is an antichain and Theorem 4 gives a unique type-2 color.\nThese cases are exhaustive; in all cases a uniquely colored edge exists. \u220e\nWhy useful here. P5 is a curated, verifiable milestone extending the |U|=4 result. It stress-tests the global triggers (Theorems 1\u20134,7) and the \u201cshared-left-endpoint \u21d2 robust L-corner\u201d pattern used at |U|=4, now with an extra point.\n\nNearest-interloper strategy for the unique\u2013maximal crossing (refinement and caution)\n- Context. In the unique\u2013maximal regime, with S={p: p_x<X, p_y<Y} and Max(S)={s_1,\u2026,s_k} (x increasing, y decreasing), the unresolved subcase is when both boundary sets T,R are nonempty, both pivots (Theorems 10 and 3) fail, and no single s_i meets both thresholds \u03b1\u2082,\u03b2\u2082 (so we have a crossing). The plan is to examine the crossing corner c=(x(s_g), y(s_{g+1})).\n- Refinement target. Define y_v as the least y\u2208(y(s_{g+1}),Y) with (x(s_g),y)\u2208U (if any), and x_h as the least x\u2208(x(s_g),X) with (x,y(s_{g+1}))\u2208U (if any). We seek a lemma: either both rays at c are clean up to their boundary supports (then Theorem 7 yields a unique type-2 at c), or at least one of the nearest interlopers yields a safe uniqueness via Theorem 3 or the global R3/R4 triggers.\n- Caution (why a na\u00efve D\u2032 fails): Emptiness only on the open segments (x=x(s_g), y\u2208(y(s_{g+1}),y(s_g))) and (y=y(s_{g+1}), x\u2208(x(s_g),x(s_{g+1}))) does not ensure r_U=s_U=1, because top-row points at x=x(s_g) or right-column points at y=y(s_{g+1}) may still contribute. Any usable lemma must quantify r_U and s_U globally or explicitly incorporate boundary contributions (cf. Theorem 5, Lemma 14).\n- Next-step formulation (to be proved next round): Nearest-interloper lemma (NIL). In the crossing subcase, if both T2\u03b1 and T2\u03b2 fail (i.e., h_{\u03b2_c}(\u03b1\u2082)\u22652 and v_{\u03b1_r}(\u03b2\u2082)\u22652), then at the crossing pair (s_g,s_{g+1}) at least one of the nearest interlopers y_v or x_h forces either (i) a robust L-corner witness (Theorem 7) at some base (\u03b1,\u03b2) among { (x(s_g),y(s_{g+1})), (x_h,y(s_{g+1})), (x(s_g),y_v) }, or (ii) a singleton+extension witness (Theorem 3) or a global row/column-of-two uniqueness (R3/R4). The proof will rely on the disjointness of rows {y(s_{i+1})} and columns {x(s_i)} across i to isolate a globally unique base.\n\nExamples and checks\n- P5, 3+2 with shared left endpoint. U={(1,1),(3,1),(5,1)}\u222a{(3,3),(7,3)}. The two rows with left endpoint 3 produce a robust L-corner at (3,1): r_U(3,1)=1 (only (3,3) above), s_U(3,1)=1 (only (5,1) to the right), so (2,3,1) is unique.\n- P5, 2+2+1 with distinct left endpoints. U={(2,1),(5,1)}\u222a{(3,4),(6,4)}\u222a{(4,7)}. Row y=1 has left endpoint \u03b1=2. No other row contains both (2,\u00b7) and a right neighbor; hence T_4(2)=1 and (4,2) is unique.\n\nObstacles and why simple attempts fail\n- Attempting to force uniqueness at a crossing corner using only \u201cno interlopers between consecutive maxima\u201d fails because boundary points at the top row/right column can inflate r_U/s_U. This is precisely why Theorem 5 uses the global counts R_i and S_i, and why Lemma 14 targets the first subrow/last left column anchored to \u03b1\u2082,\u03b2\u2082.\n\nNext steps (concrete and auditable)\n1) Curate Proposition P5 into output.md (|U|=5 classification), with the subcase split \u201cshared left endpoint \u21d2 robust L-corner (Theorem 7)\u201d made explicit.\n2) Prove the nearest-interloper lemma (NIL) for the unique\u2013maximal crossing subcase: under simultaneous failure of the boundary-local triggers (Lemma 14(a,b)), show that either the crossing corner is clean (Theorem 7 applies) or a nearest interloper enforces a singleton+extension (Theorem 3) or an R3/R4 global uniqueness.\n3) Optional clean-up: adjust notation in Theorem 11 (\u201cv(\u03b2)=1\u201d \u2192 \u201cT_3(\u03b2)=1\u201d) and add a short remark that any maxima-local specialization should be stated via R_i,S_i (global counts) rather than open-segment emptiness.\n\nWhy this is progress\n- P5 advances the curated frontier from |U|=4 to |U|=5 with a complete, checkable proof leveraging the established toolkit (Theorems 1\u20134,7,11 and R3/R4). This strengthens confidence in the local triggers used in the general proof and provides additional tested patterns (especially the \u201cshared left endpoint\u201d L-corner) that recur in larger configurations.\n- The NIL blueprint precisely identifies what remains to close the unique\u2013maximal crossing case and explains why na\u00efve segment-emptiness conditions are insufficient, guiding a correct proof structure tied to the already-curated global multiplicity formulas."
