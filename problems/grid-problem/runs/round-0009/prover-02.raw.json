The subsequent “so T_3(β)=1” makes the intended meaning clear; still, a cosmetic fix is recommended.\\n- D′ (the “explicit consecutive-maxima L-corner” formulated via emptiness of open segments) does not appear in output.md; this is good. As noted earlier in notes.md, an emptiness-only condition between consecutive maxima is not sufficient to guarantee r_U=s_U=1, because top-row/right-column contributions can inflate counts. Any curated specialization should be stated directly in terms of the global counts R_i and S_i (Theorem 5) or via Theorem 7’s exact r=s=1 hypotheses.\\n- Newly curated Theorems 12–14 (UM2′, UM-single, and the boundary-local type–2 triggers) are correct and strengthen the unique–maximal toolkit. No logical gaps detected.\\n\\nNew, rigorously stated result (small-case milestone)\\nProposition P5 (Every |U|=5 admits a uniquely colored edge).\\nStatement. If U⊆[n]×[n] has |U|=5, then G[U] contains an edge whose color appears exactly once in G[U].\\nProof (complete case analysis by row occupancy).\\nLet the multiset of row-occupancies be one of: 5; 4+1; 3+2; 3+1+1; 2+2+1; 2+1+1+1; 1+1+1+1+1.\\n- Case 5 (single row). By Theorem 2 (single-line), the rightmost edge has unique color (4,x_{4}).\\n- Case 4+1. On the 4-point row with x_1<x_2<x_3<x_4, the color (4,x_3) occurs once on that row. Any second occurrence elsewhere would require some other row to contain both (x_3,·) and a point to its right. With only one point off the 4-point row, this is impossible. Hence (4,x_3) is unique.\\n- Case 3+2. Let row β have three points at x_1<x_2<x_3, and row β′ have two points at α<γ.\\n  • If α≠x_2, then only row β contains (x_2,·) together with a right neighbor, so T_4(x_2)=1 and (4,x_2) is unique (Theorem 1, type 4).\\n  • If α=x_2, the two rows share the same left endpoint x_2. Let β_low be the smaller of {β,β′}. Then on row β_low there is exactly one point to the right of α (it is a 2-point row), and in column α there is exactly one point above β_low (the other row’s point at α). By Theorem 7 (robust L-corner), r_U(α,β_low)=s_U(α,β_low)=1 and the color (2,α,β_low) is unique.\\n- Case 3+1+1. On the 3-point row with x_1<x_2<x_3, color (4,x_2) occurs once on that row. Any other row is a singleton, so no other row contributes to T_4(x_2). Thus T_4(x_2)=1 and (4,x_2) is unique.\\n- Case 2+2+1. Let the 2-point rows be β_1,β_2 with left endpoints α_1<γ_1 on β_1 and α_2<γ_2 on β_2.\\n  • If α_1=α_2=:α, then column α contains exactly the two points on β_1,β_2, and the lower row β_low is a 2-point row. Hence r_U(α,β_low)=s_U(α,β_low)=1 and (2,α,β_low) is unique by Theorem 7.\\n  • If α_1≠α_2, pick α among {α_1,α_2}. Only its own row contains (α,·) together with a right neighbor; the other 2-point row has different left endpoint, and the remaining row is a singleton. Therefore T_4(α)=1 (Theorem 1, type 4), yielding a unique (4,α).\\n- Case 2+1+1+1. Let the 2-point row have left endpoint α. No other row has two points, so no other row contributes to T_4(α). Therefore T_4(α)=1 and (4,α) is unique.\\n- Case 1+1+1+1+1. If some column contains two points with lower y=β, then that column is the only one meeting row β (all rows are singletons), so T_3(β)=1 by Theorem 1 (type 3) and (3,β) is unique. If no column contains two points either, U is an antichain and Theorem 4 gives a unique type-2 color.\\nThese cases are exhaustive; in all cases a uniquely colored edge exists. ∎\\nWhy useful here. P5 is a curated, verifiable milestone extending the |U|=4 result. It stress-tests the global triggers (Theorems 1–4,7) and the “shared-left-endpoint ⇒ robust L-corner” pattern used at |U|=4, now with an extra point.\\n\\nNearest-interloper strategy for the unique–maximal crossing (refinement and caution)\\n- Context. In the unique–maximal regime, with S={p: p_x<X, p_y<Y} and Max(S)={s_1,…,s_k} (x increasing, y decreasing), the unresolved subcase is when both boundary sets T,R are nonempty, both pivots (Theorems 10 and 3) fail, and no single s_i meets both thresholds α₂,β₂ (so we have a crossing). The plan is to examine the crossing corner c=(x(s_g), y(s_{g+1})).\\n- Refinement target. Define y_v as the least y∈(y(s_{g+1}),Y) with (x(s_g),y)∈U (if any), and x_h as the least x∈(x(s_g),X) with (x,y(s_{g+1}))∈U (if any). We seek a lemma: either both rays at c are clean up to their boundary supports (then Theorem 7 yields a unique type-2 at c), or at least one of the nearest interlopers yields a safe uniqueness via Theorem 3 or the global R3/R4 triggers.\\n- Caution (why a naïve D′ fails): Emptiness only on the open segments (x=x(s_g), y∈(y(s_{g+1}),y(s_g))) and (y=y(s_{g+1}), x∈(x(s_g),x(s_{g+1}))) does not ensure r_U=s_U=1, because top-row points at x=x(s_g) or right-column points at y=y(s_{g+1}) may still contribute. Any usable lemma must quantify r_U and s_U globally or explicitly incorporate boundary contributions (cf. Theorem 5, Lemma 14).\\n- Next-step formulation (to be proved next round): Nearest-interloper lemma (NIL). In the crossing subcase, if both T2α and T2β fail (i.e., h_{β_c}(α₂)≥2 and v_{α_r}(β₂)≥2), then at the crossing pair (s_g,s_{g+1}) at least one of the nearest interlopers y_v or x_h forces either (i) a robust L-corner witness (Theorem 7) at some base (α,β) among { (x(s_g),y(s_{g+1})), (x_h,y(s_{g+1})), (x(s_g),y_v) }, or (ii) a singleton+extension witness (Theorem 3) or a global row/column-of-two uniqueness (R3/R4). The proof will rely on the disjointness of rows {y(s_{i+1})} and columns {x(s_i)} across i to isolate a globally unique base.\\n\\nExamples and checks\\n- P5, 3+2 with shared left endpoint. U={(1,1),(3,1),(5,1)}∪{(3,3),(7,3)}. The two rows with left endpoint 3 produce a robust L-corner at (3,1): r_U(3,1)=1 (only (3,3) above), s_U(3,1)=1 (only (5,1) to the right), so (2,3,1) is unique.\\n- P5, 2+2+1 with distinct left endpoints. U={(2,1),(5,1)}∪{(3,4),(6,4)}∪{(4,7)}. Row y=1 has left endpoint α=2. No other row contains both (2,·) and a right neighbor; hence T_4(2)=1 and (4,2) is unique.\\n\\nObstacles and why simple attempts fail\\n- Attempting to force uniqueness at a crossing corner using only “no interlopers between consecutive maxima” fails because boundary points at the top row/right column can inflate r_U/s_U. This is precisely why Theorem 5 uses the global counts R_i and S_i, and why Lemma 14 targets the first subrow/last left column anchored to α₂,β₂.\\n\\nNext steps (concrete and auditable)\\n1) Curate Proposition P5 into output.md (|U|=5 classification), with the subcase split “shared left endpoint ⇒ robust L-corner (Theorem 7)” made explicit.\\n2) Prove the nearest-interloper lemma (NIL) for the unique–maximal crossing subcase: under simultaneous failure of the boundary-local triggers (Lemma 14(a,b)), show that either the crossing corner is clean (Theorem 7 applies) or a nearest interloper enforces a singleton+extension (Theorem 3) or an R3/R4 global uniqueness.\\n3) Optional clean-up: adjust notation in Theorem 11 (“v(β)=1” → “T_3(β)=1”) and add a short remark that any maxima-local specialization should be stated via R_i,S_i (global counts) rather than open-segment emptiness.\\n\\nWhy this is progress\\n- P5 advances the curated frontier from |U|=4 to |U|=5 with a complete, checkable proof leveraging the established toolkit (Theorems 1–4,7,11 and R3/R4). This strengthens confidence in the local triggers used in the general proof and provides additional tested patterns (especially the “shared left endpoint” L-corner) that recur in larger configurations.\\n- The NIL blueprint precisely identifies what remains to close the unique–maximal crossing case and explains why naïve segment-emptiness conditions are insufficient, guiding a correct proof structure tied to the already-curated global multiplicity formulas.\"}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"auto","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"ProverOutput","schema_":{"properties":{"progress_md":{"description":"Append-only progress notes","title":"Progress Md","type":"string"}},"required":["progress_md"],"title":"ProverOutput","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":44096,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":14125,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":11584},"total_tokens":58221},"user":null,"store":true}
