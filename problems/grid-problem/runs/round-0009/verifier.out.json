  "feedback_md": "Summary of audit and integration\n- Editorial checks. Both provers flagged the same cosmetic issue in Theorem 11 (the ambiguous \u201cv(\u03b2)=1\u201d). Agreed: it should be \u201cv_\u03b1(\u03b2)=1 for the unique contributing \u03b1\u201d (equivalently T_3(\u03b2)=1). We retain the proof as correct and add an editorial correction.\n\n- New micro-lemmas from Prover 01 (S4gen/S3gen, RLclean+). These are correct and follow directly from Theorem 1 (type-3/4 multiplicities) and Theorem 7 (robust L-corner). They are useful as pattern shortcuts. Because they are immediate corollaries of already-curated results, I kept them in notes (not in the main output) to avoid redundancy.\n\n- |U|=5 classification.\n  \u2022 Prover 01 established 4+1, 3+1+1, 3+2 rigorously; the arguments are sound and rely only on Theorem 1 and Theorem 7. Good.\n  \u2022 Prover 02 proposed a full Proposition P5. Two subcases needed repair:\n    (i) Pattern 2+2+1 when the two 2-point rows share the same left endpoint \u03b1 and the 5th point also lies in column \u03b1. The claim \u201ccolumn \u03b1 contains exactly two points\u201d is false in this subcase, so the direct appeal to Theorem 7 fails. Fix: sort the three y-levels on column \u03b1. If the middle y belongs to a 2-point row, then r_U(\u03b1,\u03b2_mid)=1 and s_U(\u03b1,\u03b2_mid)=1 \u21d2 unique type 2 by Theorem 1. If the middle y is the singleton row, then row \u03b2_mid is a singleton and column \u03b1 has exactly one point above \u03b2_mid \u21d2 v_\u03b1(\u03b2_mid)=1 and no other column meets row \u03b2_mid \u21d2 T_3(\u03b2_mid)=1 (unique type 3). This resolves the hard subcase.\n    (ii) Pattern 1+1+1+1+1: the argument must handle columns with \u22653 points. Fix: pick any column with \u22652 points and choose \u03b2 to be the second-highest y in that column. Since the row \u03b2 is a singleton, only this column contributes, and v_\u03b1(\u03b2)=1 \u21d2 T_3(\u03b2)=1. If no column has \u22652 points, apply the antichain theorem (Theorem 4).\n  With these repairs the |U|=5 classification is complete. I have curated a corrected and detailed Theorem (now Theorem 15) into output.md.\n\n- Unique\u2013maximal, crossing regime. Both provers converged on the same remaining obstacle and strategy. The \u201cnearest interloper\u201d plan is the right direction; the caution that emptiness of open segments alone is insufficient is correct. The proof should quantify r_U and s_U or invoke boundary-local triggers (Lemma 14), S3gen/S4gen, or Theorem 7.\n\nWhat to do next (concrete tasks)\n1) Prove the Nearest-Interloper Lemma (NIL) in the unique\u2013maximal crossing subcase: formalize the two rays from the crossing corner c and show that either Theorem 7 fires (both rays clean up to the boundary supports) or one of the nearest interlopers yields either (a) a singleton+extension (Theorem 3), or (b) a unique type 3/4 via S3gen/S4gen.\n2) Add a compact \u201ccounting over R_i,S_i\u201d lemma for multiple maxima: if no clean gap (Theorem 5) exists, show that the excess contributors across disjoint rows/columns force a singleton+extension or an R3/R4 configuration.\n3) Editorial clean-up: note the Theorem 11 correction; later de-duplicate repeated sections.\n\nRationale\n- The curated Theorem 15 (|U|=5) represents a solid, publication-ready milestone that extends the |U|=4 result and validates the trigger library across all small patterns.\n- The NIL proof will close the unique\u2013maximal crossing regime and is now well-scaffolded by S3gen/S4gen, Lemma 14, and Theorem 7.",

Otherwise (4, x_mid) is unique: only the 3-point row contributes 1 to T_4(x_mid); the 2-point row cannot contribute positively at x_mid.\n- 3+1+1: On the 3-point row, T_4(x_mid)=1; singleton rows contribute 0 at x_mid.\n- 2+1+1+1: If the 2-point row has left endpoint \u03b1, then T_4(\u03b1)=1; no other row contributes positively at \u03b1.\n- 1+1+1+1+1: If some column \u03b1 contains \u22652 points with y-order \u03b2\u2081<\u22ef<\u03b2_k, choose \u03b2=\u03b2_{k\u22121}. Then row \u03b2 is a singleton, v_\u03b1(\u03b2)=1, and no other column meets row \u03b2; hence T_3(\u03b2)=1. If every column has \u22641 point, U is an antichain and Theorem 4 yields a unique type-2 color.\n- 2+2+1: If the 2-point rows have distinct left endpoints, let \u03b1 be either left endpoint; only that row contributes positively to T_4(\u03b1), hence T_4(\u03b1)=1.

In Theorem 11\u2019s last paragraph, replace \u201cv(\u03b2)=1\u201d by \u201cv_\u03b1(\u03b2)=1 for the unique contributing \u03b1\u201d (equivalently T_3(\u03b2)=1).\n\nNext-step scaffold (unique\u2013maximal crossing)\n- Define, in the crossing subcase, the corner c=(x(s_g),y(s_{g+1})) and the nearest interlopers y_v on the vertical ray and x_h on the horizontal ray from c. Target lemma (NIL): if both boundary-local triggers of Lemma 14 fail, then either (i) both rays are clean up to their boundary supports and Theorem 7 applies at c, or (ii) at least one of y_v or x_h yields a singleton+extension (Theorem 3) or an S3gen/S4gen witness.

Let the 4-point row be y=y\u2080 with x_1<x_2<x_3<x_4. On that row h_{y\u2080}(x_3)=1. Any other row is a singleton; if it contains (x_3,\u00b7) then h_\u03b2(x_3)=0.
