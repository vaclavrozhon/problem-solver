Both provers flagged the same cosmetic issue in Theorem 11 (the ambiguous “v(β)=1”). Agreed: it should be “v_α(β)=1 for the unique contributing α” (equivalently T_3(β)=1). We retain the proof as correct and add an editorial correction.\\n\\n- New micro-lemmas from Prover 01 (S4gen/S3gen, RLclean+). These are correct and follow directly from Theorem 1 (type-3/4 multiplicities) and Theorem 7 (robust L-corner). They are useful as pattern shortcuts. Because they are immediate corollaries of already-curated results, I kept them in notes (not in the main output) to avoid redundancy.\\n\\n- |U|=5 classification.\\n  • Prover 01 established 4+1, 3+1+1, 3+2 rigorously; the arguments are sound and rely only on Theorem 1 and Theorem 7. Good.\\n  • Prover 02 proposed a full Proposition P5. Two subcases needed repair:\\n    (i) Pattern 2+2+1 when the two 2-point rows share the same left endpoint α and the 5th point also lies in column α. The claim “column α contains exactly two points” is false in this subcase, so the direct appeal to Theorem 7 fails. Fix: sort the three y-levels on column α. If the middle y belongs to a 2-point row, then r_U(α,β_mid)=1 and s_U(α,β_mid)=1 ⇒ unique type 2 by Theorem 1. If the middle y is the singleton row, then row β_mid is a singleton and column α has exactly one point above β_mid ⇒ v_α(β_mid)=1 and no other column meets row β_mid ⇒ T_3(β_mid)=1 (unique type 3). This resolves the hard subcase.\\n    (ii) Pattern 1+1+1+1+1: the argument must handle columns with ≥3 points. Fix: pick any column with ≥2 points and choose β to be the second-highest y in that column. Since the row β is a singleton, only this column contributes, and v_α(β)=1 ⇒ T_3(β)=1. If no column has ≥2 points, apply the antichain theorem (Theorem 4).\\n  With these repairs the |U|=5 classification is complete. I have curated a corrected and detailed Theorem (now Theorem 15) into output.md.\\n\\n- Unique–maximal, crossing regime. Both provers converged on the same remaining obstacle and strategy. The “nearest interloper” plan is the right direction; the caution that emptiness of open segments alone is insufficient is correct. The proof should quantify r_U and s_U or invoke boundary-local triggers (Lemma 14), S3gen/S4gen, or Theorem 7.\\n\\nWhat to do next (concrete tasks)\\n1) Prove the Nearest-Interloper Lemma (NIL) in the unique–maximal crossing subcase: formalize the two rays from the crossing corner c and show that either Theorem 7 fires (both rays clean up to the boundary supports) or one of the nearest interlopers yields either (a) a singleton+extension (Theorem 3), or (b) a unique type 3/4 via S3gen/S4gen.\\n2) Add a compact “counting over R_i,S_i” lemma for multiple maxima: if no clean gap (Theorem 5) exists, show that the excess contributors across disjoint rows/columns force a singleton+extension or an R3/R4 configuration.\\n3) Editorial clean-up: note the Theorem 11 correction; later de-duplicate repeated sections.\\n\\nRationale\\n- The curated Theorem 15 (|U|=5) represents a solid, publication-ready milestone that extends the |U|=4 result and validates the trigger library across all small patterns.\\n- The NIL proof will close the unique–maximal crossing regime and is now well-scaffolded by S3gen/S4gen, Lemma 14, and Theorem 7.\",\"new_notes_md\":\"Additions: general corollaries, robust pattern, and the |U|=5 resolution\\n\\nImmediate corollaries of multiplicity formulas (for convenient use)\\n- S4gen (type 4 uniqueness by a single contributing row). Fix α. If there exists β₀ with (α,β₀)∈U and h_{β₀}(α)=1, and for every β≠β₀ with (α,β)∈U we have h_β(α)=0, then T_4(α)=1 and color (4,α) is unique. This is a direct read-off from Theorem 1 (type 4).\\n- S3gen (type 3 uniqueness by a single contributing column). Fix β. If there exists α₀ with (α₀,β)∈U and v_{α₀}(β)=1, and for every α≠α₀ with (α,β)∈U we have v_α(β)=0, then T_3(β)=1 and color (3,β) is unique.

If two distinct rows β₁<β₂ have points (α,β_i),(γ_i,β_i) with α<γ_i (i=1,2), and column α contains exactly (α,β₁),(α,β₂), then r_U(α,β₁)=s_U(α,β₁)=1, so (2,α,β₁) is unique by Theorem 7. This is stable under arbitrary extra points off column α.\\n\\nComplete classification for |U|=5 (key substructures and the tricky 2+2+1 subcase)\\nLet |U|=5.

Otherwise (4, x_mid) is unique: only the 3-point row contributes 1 to T_4(x_mid); the 2-point row cannot contribute positively at x_mid.\\n- 3+1+1: On the 3-point row, T_4(x_mid)=1; singleton rows contribute 0 at x_mid.\\n- 2+1+1+1: If the 2-point row has left endpoint α, then T_4(α)=1; no other row contributes positively at α.\\n- 1+1+1+1+1: If some column α contains ≥2 points with y-order β₁<⋯<β_k, choose β=β_{k−1}. Then row β is a singleton, v_α(β)=1, and no other column meets row β; hence T_3(β)=1. If every column has ≤1 point, U is an antichain and Theorem 4 yields a unique type-2 color.\\n- 2+2+1: If the 2-point rows have distinct left endpoints, let α be either left endpoint; only that row contributes positively to T_4(α), hence T_4(α)=1. If they share the same left endpoint α:\\n  • If the singleton is not in column α, apply RLclean+ to get a unique type 2 at (2,α,β_low).\\n  • If the singleton lies in column α, then column α has exactly three points. Let β_mid be the median y among them. If β_mid is one of the 2-point rows, then r_U(α,β_mid)=1 and s_U(α,β_mid)=1, hence (2,α,β_mid) is unique. If β_mid is the singleton row, then v_α(β_mid)=1 and no other column meets row β_mid, so T_3(β_mid)=1.\\n\\nEditorial correction (notational).

Target lemma (NIL): if both boundary-local triggers of Lemma 14 fail, then either (i) both rays are clean up to their boundary supports and Theorem 7 applies at c, or (ii) at least one of y_v or x_h yields a singleton+extension (Theorem 3) or an S3gen/S4gen witness. The disjointness of the rows {y(s_{i+1})} and columns {x(s_i)} across i isolates a single contributing base, ensuring uniqueness.\",\"new_notes_append\":\"True\",\"new_outputs_md\":\"Theorems currently established (continued)\\n15) Every five-point set admits a uniquely colored edge.\\n\\nProofs (additions)\\n\\nTheorem 15 (Every five-point set admits a uniquely colored edge).\\nLet U⊆[n]×[n] with |U|=5. Classify by the multiset of row-occupancies.\\n- Case 5 (single row). By Theorem 2, on that row the unique color is (4,x_4), where x_1<⋯<x_5 are the x-coordinates.\\n- Case 4+1. Let the 4-point row be y=y₀ with x_1<x_2<x_3<x_4. On that row h_{y₀}(x_3)=1. Any other row is a singleton; if it contains (x_3,·) then h_β(x_3)=0. Hence T_4(x_3)=1 by Theorem 1 (type 4), so (4,x_3) is unique.\\n- Case 3+2. Let the 3-point row be y=y₀ with x_1<x_2<x_3 and the 2-point row be y=y₁ with α<γ.\\n  • If α≠x_2, then only row y₀ contributes positively to T_4(x_2): h_{y₀}(x_2)=1, while on row y₁ either (x_2,y₁)∉U or it is the right endpoint there (so h_{y₁}(x_2)=0). Thus T_4(x_2)=1 and (4,x_2) is unique.\\n  • If α=x_2, then in column α we have exactly (α,y₀),(α,y₁). On the lower of {y₀,y₁}, r_U(α,β)=1 and, being a 2-point row, s_U(α,β)=1. By Theorem 7, (2,α,β) is unique.\\n- Case 3+1+1. Let the 3-point row be y=y₀ with x_1<x_2<x_3. On that row h_{y₀}(x_2)=1; the two other rows are singletons, so no other row contributes to T_4(x_2). Hence T_4(x_2)=1 and (4,x_2) is unique.\\n- Case 2+2+1. Let the 2-point rows be y=β₁ with points (α₁,β₁),(γ₁,β₁) (α₁<γ₁) and y=β₂ with (α₂,β₂),(γ₂,β₂) (α₂<γ₂), and let the remaining point be a singleton.\\n  • If α₁≠α₂, pick α∈{α₁,α₂}. Only its own 2-point row contains (α,·) with a right neighbor, so h_{β}(α)=1 for that row and all other rows contribute 0 at α. Hence T_4(α)=1 and (4,α) is unique.\\n  • If α₁=α₂=:α and the singleton is not in column α, then column α contains exactly (α,β₁),(α,β₂). On the lower of {β₁,β₂} we have r_U(α,β)=1 and, being a 2-point row, s_U(α,β)=1. By Theorem 7, (2,α,β) is unique.\\n  • If α₁=α₂=:α and the singleton also lies in column α, then column α contains exactly three points at y-levels β_a<β_b<β_c. If the middle level β_b is a 2-point row, then r_U(α,β_b)=1 and s_U(α,β_b)=1, so (2,α,β_b) is unique by Theorem 1 (type 2). If the middle level is the singleton row, then v_α(β_b)=1 and no other column meets row β_b (it is a singleton row), hence T_3(β_b)=1 and (3,β_b) is unique.\\n- Case 2+1+1+1. Let the 2-point row have left endpoint α. Then h_β(α)=1 on that row and every other row is a singleton; if another row meets column α, it contributes 0 at α. Thus T_4(α)=1 and (4,α) is unique.\\n- Case 1+1+1+1+1. If some column α contains at least two points with y-order β_1<⋯<β_k (k≥2), choose β=β_{k−1} (the second-highest y in that column). Row β is a singleton, and v_α(β)=1; no other column meets row β, so T_3(β)=1 and (3,β) is unique. If every column contains at most one point, U is an antichain and Theorem 4 yields a unique type-2 color.\\nThese cases are exhaustive. In each case G[U] contains a uniquely colored edge. ∎\\n\\nRemark (editorial correction to Theorem 11).
