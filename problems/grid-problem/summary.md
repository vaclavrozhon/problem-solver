Round 0004 produced a suite of rigorous, checkable lemmas that settle many base cases and clarify the remaining obstruction. Exact global multiplicity formulas were proved for all four edge types: type-1 equals the number of NE neighbors of its SW endpoint; type-2 multiplicity is r_U(α,β)·s_U(α,β); types 3 and 4 are given by explicit row/column sums, yielding necessary-and-sufficient uniqueness tests. Single-row/column lemmas (C1/C2, E/F) and the unique-maximal lemma (C3) are proved and used. For multiple maxima, Lemma D shows a clean gap (R_i=S_i=1) between consecutive maxima gives a unique type-2 color. Theorem verified on many structured families (all |U|=3, any row/column with ≥3 points, certain 2×2 ‘‘clean margin’’ rectangles). Main remaining obstacle: configurations with |Max(U)|≥2 where every consecutive pair has at least one of R_i,S_i>1. Next steps propose a gap-dichotomy or symmetric minimal-element approach and counting checks on worst-case ‘‘staircase’’ examples. Citations: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json.

Round 0005 added several localized, verifiable triggers and closed small-case gaps while isolating a single remaining hard subcase. Prover-01 introduced unique-maximal case lemmas H' (boundary-threshold ⇒ unique type–1) and K/K' (top-row/right-column pivots ⇒ unique types 4/3) and gave a complete |U|=4 proof (Proposition P4). Prover-02 added complementary triggers XR (support ⊆ one row ∪ one column ⇒ unique 3/4), J (empty L–corner ⇒ unique type–2), and L (top/right extremality on consecutive maxima ⇒ unique type–2), and showed S=∅ (no strictly SW points of the unique maximum) is handled by XR. Both audits removed the earlier false global claim about “≥3 on a row/column ⇒ unique 4/3.” The remaining isolated obstacle is the unique-maximal subcase where every SW-maximal point fails the H' thresholds and α₂,β₂ reappear so K/K' don't fire; the plan is to finish it by formalizing a robust L-corner (D') and a pivot-or-corner dichotomy and to stress-test with |U|=5.

Round 0006 audit: Both provers located the same gap in Theorem 11 (|U|=4): a claim that “no other column contains a point at row β” is false (counterexample: the 2×2 rectangle). Two clean fixes were proposed: split the subcase by whether the right endpoints coincide (γ1≠γ2 vs γ1=γ2) or replace the argument by applying Theorem 7 (robust L-corner) at the lower-left (α,β). Apart from that subcase, Theorems 1–10 are sound. New, checkable micro-lemmas were introduced: R4/R3 (row/column-of-two with a globally unique base ⇒ unique type 4/3) and R1 / UM1–UM3 (for p∈Max(S), r_U(α,β),s_U(α,β)≤1, so any NE neighbors lie only on the top row/right column). Using these, a pivot-or-corner plan around an extremal p∈Max(S) (max x, then max y) splits into regimes A/B/C and yields concrete triggers (H′, K, singleton+extension, or robust L-corner). Next technical steps are stated below. Citations: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json.

## round-0007 — model summary — 2025-08-27T20:02:53.198896Z
Two provers advanced the proof toolkit for the “unique color” goal. Prover-01 added rigorous local lemmas: O1 (unique maximal ⇒ coordinatewise maxima), UM1 (SW-maxima have empty interior on their column/row), D′ (consecutive-maxima L-corner specialization of Theorem 7), and R3/R4 (singleton+extension triggers for columns/rows with two points). Prover-02 built threshold machinery for the unique-maximal regime: UM–X and UM–Y (guarantee an SW-maximal meeting x- or y-threshold unless a pivot resolves the instance), a two-threshold corollary reducing cases, and RL (robust L-corner for two 2-point rows). Both provers sketched the remaining strategy: handle the “crossing” subcase via nearest-neighbor/nearest-boundary lemmas to produce either a type–2 L-corner or a type–3/4 singleton trigger, and prove a counting lemma that, when D′ fails across consecutive maxima, forces an R3/R4 or D′ witness. Verifier: partial success. Next concrete tasks: formalize the nearest-neighbor offender ⇒ type–3/4 lemma, prove the counting lemma for multiple maxima, and curate the new lemmas into output.md.

## round-0008 — model summary — 2025-08-27T20:15:22.520035Z
Audit found no new gaps in the curated Theorems 1–11; Theorem 11 (|U|=4) is sound after the switch to Theorem 7. Two new lemmas strengthen the unique–maximal toolkit: UM2′ (a SW-max p that also touches both top/right boundaries forces a unique type–2 color) and Theorem UM-single (if the down-left region under the unique maximal m has exactly one product-order maximal p then G[U] has a unique color), proved by a case split using pivots/thresholds and existing lemmas. A symmetric robust L-corner RL′ was proposed. Prover-02 added two boundary-local type–2 triggers T2α and T2β that act immediately after pivot failures and simplify the crossing analysis. The remaining hard case is |Max(S)|≥2 (crossing pairs); the author plans a nearest-interloper lemma that either produces a clean L-corner (Theorem 7) or converts an interloper into a safe singleton/extension or R3/R4 witness. Verifier verdict: partial success. Files relied on: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json.
