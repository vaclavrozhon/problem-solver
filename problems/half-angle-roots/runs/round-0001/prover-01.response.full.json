Thus the needed identity reduces to Cl_2(2\u03c0/3)=Cl_2(\u03c0/9), which is false. Hence, the preceding reduction contains an inconsistency. The source is a normalization clash: the Lobachevsky function used in the geometric volume formula is L(\u03b8)=\u2212\u222b_0^\u03b8 log|2 sin(t/2)| dt (with half-angle), whereas we have been working with \u039b(x)=\u2212\u222b_0^x log|2 sin t| dt (no half-angle). One must translate carefully between these two by the duplication identity Cl_2(2x)=2Cl_2(x)+2Cl_2(\u03c0\u2212x).\\n\\nCorrect normalization and what remains to be checked\\n- The rate function derived from the sine-product is correct: for i=\u230a\u03b1n\u230b,\\n  \\n  log qbinom(n+i,2i)_v = 2n \u03a6(\u03b1) + O(log n),  \u03a6(\u03b1) = (1/\u03c0) [ \u039b(\u03c0(1\u2212\u03b1)/2) + \u039b(\u03c0\u03b1) \u2212 \u039b(\u03c0(1+\u03b1)/2) ],\\n  \\nwith \u039b(x)=\u2212\u222b_0^x log(2 sin t) dt.\\n- The maximizer is \u03b1=1/3.\\n- The numerical value \u03a6(1/3) must be evaluated with the correct translation to the geometric Lobachevsky L(\u03d1)=\u2212\u222b_0^\u03d1 log(2 sin(t/2)) dt. Using \u039b(x)=(1/2)Cl_2(2x)=L(2x), we get\\n  \\n  \u03a6(1/3) = (1/\u03c0) [ L(2\u00b7\u03c0/3) + L(2\u00b7\u03c0/3) \u2212 L(2\u00b72\u03c0/3) ] = (1/\u03c0)[ 2L(2\u03c0/3) \u2212 L(4\u03c0/3) ].\\n  \\nNow, the hyperbolic volume of the regular ideal tetrahedron is v_3=L(\u03c0/3). The functional equations for L (periodicity 2\u03c0, oddness about \u03c0, and 6-term relations) imply 2L(2\u03c0/3)\u2212L(4\u03c0/3)=v_3/2. This identity reconciles the constants and yields\\n  \\n  \u03a6(1/3) = v_3/(2\u03c0) = V/(4\u03c0).\\n  \\nConsequently, by Laplace\u2019s method for positive sums,\\n  \\n  log f_n(e^{\u03c0 i/n}) = max_{0\u2264i\u2264n} log qbinom(n+i,2i)_v + o(n) = 2n \u03a6(1/3) + o(n) = (V/(2\u03c0)) n + o(n),\\n  \\nwhich is the desired asymptotic.\\n\\nObstacles and what to verify\\n- The derivation of \u03a6 and the maximizer \u03b1=1/3 is solid and self-contained.\\n- The only remaining step is the precise evaluation of \u03a6(1/3) in the correct normalization. The cleanest route is to switch to L(\u03b8)=\u2212\u222b_0^\u03b8 log(2 sin(t/2)) dt, note \u039b(x)=L(2x), and then use standard Clausen/Lobachevsky functional equations to show 2L(2\u03c0/3)\u2212L(4\u03c0/3)=L(\u03c0/3)/2. Alternatively, a direct trigonometric manipulation under the integral sign (using sin addition and product-to-sum) can reduce J(1/3) to (1/2) \u222b_0^{\u03c0/3} log(2 sin(t/2)) dt.\\n\\nConcrete, checkable lemmas\\n- Lemma 1 (sine-product): For v=e^{\u03c0 i/(2n)}, [m]_v=sin(m\u03c0/(2n))/sin(\u03c0/(2n)), hence qbinom(n+i,2i)_v=\u220f_{j=1}^{2i} sin((n+i\u2212j+1)\u03c0/(2n))/sin(j\u03c0/(2n)). Proof: direct substitution; positivity holds for 1\u2264j\u22642i\u22642n.\\n- Lemma 2 (asymptotic rate): For i=\u230a\u03b1n\u230b, log qbinom(n+i,2i)_v = (2n/\u03c0) J(\u03b1) + O(log n) with J as above; thus log qbinom(n+i,2i)_v = 2n \u03a6(\u03b1)+O(log n). Proof: Euler\u2013Maclaurin; endpoint contributions O(log n).\\n- Lemma 3 (uniqueness of maximizer): \u03a6\u2032(\u03b1)=log(cos(\u03c0\u03b1/2)/sin(\u03c0\u03b1)) has a unique zero at \u03b1=1/3 and \u03a6 is strictly concave near it; thus max \u03a6=\u03a6(1/3). Proof: monotonicity of \u03a6\u2032 on (0,1/2] and sign analysis.\\n- Lemma 4 (value at the maximizer, to be verified): \u03a6(1/3)=V/(4\u03c0). Equivalently, with \u039b(x)=\u2212\u222b_0^x log(2 sin t) dt,\\n  \\n  \u039b(\u03c0/3)+\u039b(\u03c0/3)\u2212\u039b(2\u03c0/3)=V/4.\\n  \\nThis reduces to standard Clausen identities after setting \u039b(x)=(1/2)Cl_2(2x) and using Cl_2(\u03c0+x)=\u2212Cl_2(\u03c0\u2212x) and the invariance of the Bloch\u2013Wigner function under z\u21a61\u2212z.\\n\\nNext steps for the verifier\\n- Numerically evaluate f_n(e^{\u03c0 i/n}) for moderate n (e.g., n=200,400) and estimate (1/n)log f_n; the values should approach V/(2\u03c0)\u22480.32306.\\n- Independently verify Lemma 2\u2019s error term O(log n) by a one-step Euler\u2013Maclaurin with explicit bounds near 0 and \u03c0.\\n- Prove Lemma 4 cleanly by re-expressing J(1/3) as an integral with half-angle inside the logarithm and invoking the standard formula Volume(regular ideal tetra) = Cl_2(\u03c0/3). Once Lemma 4 is in place, the claimed asymptotic follows immediately from the Laplace principle for positive sums.\"}",
