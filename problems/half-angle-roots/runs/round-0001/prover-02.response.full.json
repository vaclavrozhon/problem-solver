Then\\nlog C_{n,i}=\\\\frac{1}{\u03c6}\\\\Big(\u039b(2x)+2\u039b(\\\\tfrac{\u03c0}{2}\u2212x)\\\\Big)+O(\\\\log n).\\nSince \u03c6=\u03c0/(2n), this becomes\\nlog C_{n,i}=\\\\frac{2n}{\u03c0}\\\\,F(x)+O(\\\\log n), \\\\quad F(x):=\u039b(2x)+2\u039b(\\\\tfrac{\u03c0}{2}\u2212x).\\n\\nLocation of the maximizer and its value\\nCompute F\u2032(x)=2(\\\\log(2\\\\cos x)\u2212\\\\log(2\\\\sin 2x)). Thus F\u2032(x)=0 iff 2\\\\cos x=2\\\\sin(2x), i.e. 1=2\\\\sin x, so x\u22c6=\u03c0/6. One checks F''(\u03c0/6)<0, hence x\u22c6 is the unique maximizer in (0,\u03c0/2). Its value is\\nF(\u03c0/6)=\u039b(\u03c0/3)+2\u039b(\u03c0/3)=3\u039b(\u03c0/3).\\nRecall V(4_1)=2\u00b7vol(regular ideal tetrahedron)=2\u00b7(2\u039b(\u03c0/3))=4\u039b(\u03c0/3).\\nHence F(\u03c0/6)=\\\\tfrac{3}{4}V(4_1).\\nTherefore, for i=\u230an/3\u230b,\\nlog C_{n,\u230an/3\u230b}=\\\\frac{2n}{\u03c0}\\\\,3\u039b(\u03c0/3)+O(\\\\log n)=\\\\frac{3V}{2\u03c0}\\\\,n+O(\\\\log n).\\nMoreover, for any fixed \u03b4\u2208(0,1/3), uniformly for i with |i/n\u22121/3|\u2265\u03b4 we have F(x)\u2264F(\u03c0/6)\u2212c(\u03b4)<F(\u03c0/6), so C_{n,i} is exponentially smaller.\\n\\nConsequences for f_n at q=e^{\u03c0 i/n}\\n- Positivity: For 0\u2264i<n, C_{n,i}>0 and C_{n,n}=0. Hence\\nmax_{0\u2264i\u2264n} C_{n,i} \u2264 f_n(e^{\u03c0 i/n}) \u2264 (n+1)\u00b7max_{0\u2264i\u2264n} C_{n,i}.\\n- Exponential growth: It follows that\\nlog f_n(e^{\u03c0 i/n})=\\\\max_i\\\\log C_{n,i}+O(\\\\log n)=\\\\frac{2n}{\u03c0}\\\\,F(\u03c0/6)+O(\\\\log n)=\\\\frac{3V}{2\u03c0}\\\\,n+O(\\\\log n).\\nEquivalently,\\nf_n(e^{\u03c0 i/n})=\\\\exp\\\\Big(\\\\frac{3V}{2\u03c0}\\\\,n+o(n)\\\\Big).\\n\\nExamples / sanity checks\\n- The maximizing index predicted by the continuous analysis is i\u2248n/3. The discrete ratio\\nR_{n}(i):=C_{n,i+1}/C_{n,i}=[n\u2212i]_v[n+i+1]_v/([2i+1]_v[2i+2]_v)\\nwith [m]_v=sin(m\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 satisfies, in the n\u2192\u221e, i/n\u2192\u03b1 limit with x=(\u03c0/2)\u03b1,\\nR_{n}(i)\u2192\\\\frac{\\\\cos x\u00b7\\\\cos x}{\\\\sin(2x)\u00b7\\\\sin(2x)}.\\nThus R_{n}(i)>1 for \u03b1<1/3 and R_{n}(i)<1 for \u03b1>1/3, confirming unimodality and the location of the maximum.\\n\\nObstacles and required rigor\\n- The Euler\u2013Maclaurin step with O(\\\\log n) error for the log-sine and log-cosine sums should be recorded carefully (standard in the literature on the Volume Conjecture and quantum factorial asymptotics). Uniformity in i/n\u2208[\u03b5,1\u2212\u03b5] is straightforward; near the endpoints a separate bound suffices since those terms are exponentially irrelevant.\\n- One should give a short proof that C_{n,i}>0 for 0\u2264i<n, ensuring no sign cancellations occur.\\n- To pin down the pre-exponential factor, a local quadratic approximation of F near x=\u03c0/6 and a discrete Laplace method can be applied, but it is not needed for the exponential rate.\\n\\nConclusion (provisional)\\n- The rate function governing a single summand is F(x)=\u039b(2x)+2\u039b(\\\\tfrac{\u03c0}{2}\u2212x). Its unique maximizer is x=\u03c0/6 with F(\u03c0/6)=3\u039b(\u03c0/3)=3V/4.\\n- Because all summands are positive for i<n, f_n(e^{\u03c0 i/n}) has the same exponential growth as the maximal summand. Therefore\\nf_n(e^{\u03c0 i/n})=\\\\exp\\\\Big(\\\\frac{3V}{2\u03c0}\\\\,n+o(n)\\\\Big).\\n- This contradicts the stated claim (which has V/(2\u03c0) instead of 3V/(2\u03c0)). Either the claim needs revision, or the object to be summed (or the root of unity) is different from what is written. The derivation above is auditable term-by-term and reduces the problem to standard asymptotics of trigonometric products via the Lobachevsky function.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Provide a fully rigorous, uniform Euler\u2013Maclaurin estimate for S_s and S_c with explicit O(\\\\log n) error.\\n- Write a concise proof of positivity/unimodality using R_n(i) and monotonicity of sin/cos on (0,\u03c0/2).\\n- Verify numerically for moderate n that (\u03c0/(2n))log f_n(e^{\u03c0 i/n}) approaches 3\u039b(\u03c0/3)\u22481.522412\u2026/2? In terms of growth rate per n, 3V/(2\u03c0)\u22480.9689.\\n- Check if an alternative normalization (e.g. unsymmetrized q-binom, or q=e^{2\u03c0 i/n}) produces the claimed V/(2\u03c0) rate; this would align with known results for the figure-eight colored Jones polynomial at principal roots of unity.\"}",
