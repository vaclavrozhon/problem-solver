Ideas
- Re-express each summand at the half-angle root v=e^{π i/(2n)} in terms of products of sines/cosines and pass to a continuum limit via Euler–Maclaurin. This produces an explicit “rate function” in terms of the Lobachevsky function Λ(x) that governs the exponential growth of each summand.
- Locate the index i that maximizes the rate and evaluate the maximal value in closed form. Since the summands are positive for 0≤i<n, the growth of f_n is the same (to exponential order) as that of the maximal summand. This reduces the asymptotic of f_n to the maximization of a 1-variable function.
- The resulting maximal exponent is 3Λ(π/3), i.e. 3/4 of the figure-eight volume V, so the asymptotic rate for f_n is exp((3V/(2π))n+o(n)), not exp((V/(2π))n+o(n)). This suggests the stated claim (with V/(2π)) is too small by a factor of 3.

Setup and basic identities
Let v=e^{π i/(2n)}, θ=π/(2n). For m∈ℕ,
[m]_v=(v^m-v^{-m})/(v-v^{-1})=sin(mθ)/sinθ.
For i∈[0,n], write the summand
C_{n,i}:=\qbinom{n+i}{2i}_v=\frac{[n+i]_v!}{[2i]_v![n-i]_v!}.
Using [m]_v=sin(mθ)/sinθ, and cancelling the sinθ factors, we get the exact product formula
C_{n,i}=\prod_{r=1}^{2i}\frac{\sin((n-i+r)θ)}{\sin(rθ)}=\prod_{r=1}^{2i}\frac{\cos((r-i)θ)}{\sin(rθ)}.
Rearranging the numerator,
∏_{r=1}^{2i}\cos((r-i)θ)=\cos(iθ)∏_{k=1}^{i-1}\cos^2(kθ),
so for 0≤i<n we have C_{n,i}>0 (denominator terms sin(rθ)>0 for 1≤r≤2i≤2n−2, and numerator cos(kθ)>0 for |k|≤i≤n−1). Also C_{n,n}=0.

Rate function and pointwise asymptotics of a fixed summand
Define φ:=θ=π/(2n), x:=iφ∈[0,π/2]. Then
log C_{n,i}=\log(\cos(iφ))+2∑_{k=1}^{i-1}\log(\cos(kφ))−∑_{r=1}^{2i}\log(\sin(rφ)).
It is convenient to work with 2sin/2cos versions:
S_c(m):=∑_{k=1}^{m}\log(2\cos(kφ)), S_s(m):=∑_{r=1}^{m}\log(2\sin(rφ)).
A short algebra shows
log C_{n,i}=2S_c(i-1)+\log(2\cos(iφ))−S_s(2i)+O(1).
Euler–Maclaurin (with standard control near 0 and away from π/2) yields, uniformly for i in compact subintervals of {1,2,…,n−1},
S_c(i-1)=\frac{1}{φ}\int_0^{x}\log(2\cos t)\,dt+O(\log n), \quad S_s(2i)=\frac{1}{φ}\int_0^{2x}\log(2\sin t)\,dt+O(\log n).
Thus
log C_{n,i}=\frac{1}{φ}\Big(2\int_0^{x}\log(2\cos t)\,dt−\int_0^{2x}\log(2\sin t)\,dt\Big)+O(\log n).
Introduce the Lobachevsky function Λ(y):=−∫_0^y\log(2\sin t)\,dt (so Λ(π/2)=0) and note ∫_0^x\log(2\cos t)\,dt=Λ(π/2−x). Then
log C_{n,i}=\frac{1}{φ}\Big(Λ(2x)+2Λ(\tfrac{π}{2}−x)\Big)+O(\log n).
Since φ=π/(2n), this becomes
log C_{n,i}=\frac{2n}{π}\,F(x)+O(\log n), \quad F(x):=Λ(2x)+2Λ(\tfrac{π}{2}−x).

Location of the maximizer and its value
Compute F′(x)=2(\log(2\cos x)−\log(2\sin 2x)). Thus F′(x)=0 iff 2\cos x=2\sin(2x), i.e. 1=2\sin x, so x⋆=π/6. One checks F''(π/6)<0, hence x⋆ is the unique maximizer in (0,π/2). Its value is
F(π/6)=Λ(π/3)+2Λ(π/3)=3Λ(π/3).
Recall V(4_1)=2·vol(regular ideal tetrahedron)=2·(2Λ(π/3))=4Λ(π/3).
Hence F(π/6)=\tfrac{3}{4}V(4_1).
Therefore, for i=⌊n/3⌋,
log C_{n,⌊n/3⌋}=\frac{2n}{π}\,3Λ(π/3)+O(\log n)=\frac{3V}{2π}\,n+O(\log n).
Moreover, for any fixed δ∈(0,1/3), uniformly for i with |i/n−1/3|≥δ we have F(x)≤F(π/6)−c(δ)<F(π/6), so C_{n,i} is exponentially smaller.

Consequences for f_n at q=e^{π i/n}
- Positivity: For 0≤i<n, C_{n,i}>0 and C_{n,n}=0. Hence
max_{0≤i≤n} C_{n,i} ≤ f_n(e^{π i/n}) ≤ (n+1)·max_{0≤i≤n} C_{n,i}.
- Exponential growth: It follows that
log f_n(e^{π i/n})=\max_i\log C_{n,i}+O(\log n)=\frac{2n}{π}\,F(π/6)+O(\log n)=\frac{3V}{2π}\,n+O(\log n).
Equivalently,
f_n(e^{π i/n})=\exp\Big(\frac{3V}{2π}\,n+o(n)\Big).

Examples / sanity checks
- The maximizing index predicted by the continuous analysis is i≈n/3. The discrete ratio
R_{n}(i):=C_{n,i+1}/C_{n,i}=[n−i]_v[n+i+1]_v/([2i+1]_v[2i+2]_v)
with [m]_v=sin(mθ)/sinθ satisfies, in the n→∞, i/n→α limit with x=(π/2)α,
R_{n}(i)→\frac{\cos x·\cos x}{\sin(2x)·\sin(2x)}.
Thus R_{n}(i)>1 for α<1/3 and R_{n}(i)<1 for α>1/3, confirming unimodality and the location of the maximum.

Obstacles and required rigor
- The Euler–Maclaurin step with O(\log n) error for the log-sine and log-cosine sums should be recorded carefully (standard in the literature on the Volume Conjecture and quantum factorial asymptotics). Uniformity in i/n∈[ε,1−ε] is straightforward; near the endpoints a separate bound suffices since those terms are exponentially irrelevant.
- One should give a short proof that C_{n,i}>0 for 0≤i<n, ensuring no sign cancellations occur.
- To pin down the pre-exponential factor, a local quadratic approximation of F near x=π/6 and a discrete Laplace method can be applied, but it is not needed for the exponential rate.

Conclusion (provisional)
- The rate function governing a single summand is F(x)=Λ(2x)+2Λ(\tfrac{π}{2}−x). Its unique maximizer is x=π/6 with F(π/6)=3Λ(π/3)=3V/4.
- Because all summands are positive for i<n, f_n(e^{π i/n}) has the same exponential growth as the maximal summand. Therefore
f_n(e^{π i/n})=\exp\Big(\frac{3V}{2π}\,n+o(n)\Big).
- This contradicts the stated claim (which has V/(2π) instead of 3V/(2π)). Either the claim needs revision, or the object to be summed (or the root of unity) is different from what is written. The derivation above is auditable term-by-term and reduces the problem to standard asymptotics of trigonometric products via the Lobachevsky function.

Next steps
- Provide a fully rigorous, uniform Euler–Maclaurin estimate for S_s and S_c with explicit O(\log n) error.
- Write a concise proof of positivity/unimodality using R_n(i) and monotonicity of sin/cos on (0,π/2).
- Verify numerically for moderate n that (π/(2n))log f_n(e^{π i/n}) approaches 3Λ(π/3)≈1.522412…/2? In terms of growth rate per n, 3V/(2π)≈0.9689.
- Check if an alternative normalization (e.g. unsymmetrized q-binom, or q=e^{2π i/n}) produces the claimed V/(2π) rate; this would align with known results for the figure-eight colored Jones polynomial at principal roots of unity.
