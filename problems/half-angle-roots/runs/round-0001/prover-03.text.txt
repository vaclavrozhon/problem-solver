Ideas and quick verdict
- The current writeup contains only the statement of the claim and no proof. A key first check is to compare the claim’s growth rate with the size of the largest summand in f_n.
- For v=e^{π i/(2n)} (so θ:=π/(2n)), one has [m]_v = sin(mθ)/sin θ, hence the summand admits an exact product-of-sines form. A Laplace-type analysis (Riemann sum/Euler–Maclaurin) then gives a rate function for log of each term. This analysis shows the largest summand grows like exp((V/π + o(1)) n), not exp((V/(2π) + o(1)) n). Since all terms are nonnegative, f_n is at least as large as its largest term, so the claim as stated cannot be true.

Derivation: product-of-sines and the rate function
Fix n∈N and set θ=π/(2n). For v=e^{iθ} one has [m]_v = sin(mθ)/sin θ, hence
[ n+i \choose 2i ]_v = \frac{\prod_{m=n-i+1}^{n+i}\sin(mθ)}{\prod_{m=1}^{2i}\sin(mθ)}.
Equivalently, using sin((n±p)θ)=cos(pθ) and sin(nθ)=1,
log [ n+i \choose 2i ]_v = log cos(iθ) + 2\sum_{p=1}^{i-1} log cos(pθ) − \sum_{m=1}^{2i} log sin(mθ).
Let x=i/n∈[0,1]. Approximating sums by integrals (replace ∑ f(kθ) by (1/θ)∫ f plus O(log n) error), we obtain uniformly for i linear in n
log [ n+i \choose 2i ]_v = n·φ(x) + O(log n),
with the rate function
φ(x) = (2/π)\Big(2∫_{0}^{(π/2)x} log cos t dt − ∫_{0}^{π x} log sin t dt\Big).
Using the identities
∫_{0}^{y} log(2 sin t) dt = −\tfrac12 Cl_2(2y),  ∫_{0}^{y} log(2 cos t) dt = \tfrac12 Cl_2(π−2y),
(and subtracting y log 2), this simplifies to
φ(x) = (2/π) Cl_2(π(1−x)) + (1/π) Cl_2(2π x),
where Cl_2 is the Clausen function Cl_2(θ)=∑_{k≥1} sin(kθ)/k^2.

Location and value of the maximum
- Differentiate: φ′(x)=2 log( cos( (π/2)x ) / sin(π x) ). Thus the unique critical point in (0,1) solves cos( (π/2)x ) = sin(π x), i.e. 2 sin( (π/2)x ) cos( (π/2)x ) = cos( (π/2)x ), giving x=1/3. A second-derivative check shows φ is strictly concave on (0,1), hence this is the global maximizer.
- Evaluate at x=1/3. A short computation gives
φ(1/3) = (2/π)·(2∫_0^{π/6} log cos t dt − ∫_0^{π/3} log sin t dt) = (3/π) Cl_2(2π/3).
Using the standard hyperbolic geometry identity V(4_1) = 2·vol(regular ideal tetrahedron) = 2 Cl_2(π/3) and the relation 2 Cl_2(π/3) = 3 Cl_2(2π/3), we obtain
φ(1/3) = V/π.
Thus the largest term grows like exp((V/π + o(1)) n).

Immediate contradiction with the current claim
- Each summand [n+i \choose 2i]_v is nonnegative when θ∈(0,π/2) (indeed sin(mθ)>0 for m=1,…,2n−1), hence f_n is at least the largest term. Therefore
liminf_{n→∞} (1/n) log f_n(e^{π i/n}) ≥ V/π.
- The stated claim predicts lim (1/n) log f_n(e^{π i/n}) = V/(2π), which is strictly smaller. This contradicts the lower bound coming from the largest summand.
- Heuristically, the sum is dominated by indices i≈n/3; a standard Laplace principle shows the entire sum has the same exponential rate as its maximum. Thus the correct exponential rate should be V/π, not V/(2π).

How to make a rigorous upper bound (sketch)
- Concavity: φ is C^2 and strictly concave on [0,1], with unique maximizer x⋆=1/3 and φ(x) ≤ φ(x⋆) − c(x−x⋆)^2 for some c>0.
- Uniform approximation: For i=⌊xn⌋ with x in a fixed compact subset of (0,1), Euler–Maclaurin or monotone Riemann-sum bounds give log [ n+i \choose 2i ]_v = n φ(x) + O(log n), uniformly in x. Near the endpoints x≈0 or 1, the O(log n) control still holds (handling the integrable singularity at 0 of log sin via standard harmonic sum estimates).
- Upper bound by Laplace method: Split the sum into |i−x⋆n| ≤ n^{3/4} and its complement. Outside the window, φ(x) ≤ φ(x⋆) − η for some η>0, so the contribution is at most exp(n(φ(x⋆)−η)+O(log n)). Inside the window, use the uniform O(log n) approximation and discrete Gaussian summation to bound the contribution by exp(n φ(x⋆) + O(log n)). Thus
log f_n(e^{π i/n}) = n φ(1/3) + o(n) = (V/π) n + o(n).

Specific issues/gaps to fix in the writeup
1) The main claim’s exponent appears off by a factor of 2.
- As shown above, a single term at i≈n/3 already forces growth exp((V/π + o(1)) n), contradicting V/(2π).
- Recommended correction: f_n(e^{π i/n}) = exp((V/π + o(1)) n).

2) No justification is given for evaluating the q-binomial at roots of unity.
- Note the exact sin-product expression shows cancellations of potential 0’s (e.g. [2n]_v) occur harmlessly inside the ratio; this should be explicitly recorded to avoid ambiguity about specialization.

3) No quantitative error bounds.
- The step from sums to integrals should include a rigorous bound (e.g. via Euler–Maclaurin or monotone sum-integral inequalities), yielding an O(log n) error. This is necessary to justify both lower and upper bounds.

4) The connection to V(4_1).
- The evaluation φ(1/3)=3 Cl_2(2π/3)/π and the identity 3 Cl_2(2π/3)=V should be cited (e.g. via the Lobachevsky function Λ(α) = −∫_0^α log(2 sin t) dt and V=2Λ(π/3)). Include a short derivation or a standard reference.

5) Context with the volume conjecture.
- The classical volume conjecture uses q=e^{2π i/N}. Here q=e^{π i/n}=e^{2π i/(2n)}. The corrected asymptotic exp((V/π)n) matches the rate one would expect if one took N=2n in the standard conjecture; the current claim incorrectly keeps the smaller coefficient V/(2π).

Actionable next steps for a rigorous writeup
- State and prove the product-of-sines identity for the summand at v=e^{π i/(2n)}.
- Define the rate function φ and prove the uniform approximation log s_i = n φ(i/n) + O(log n).
- Prove strict concavity of φ, find the unique maximizer x⋆=1/3, and compute φ(1/3)=V/π via Clausen/Lobachevsky identities.
- Carry out the Laplace upper bound to conclude log f_n = n φ(x⋆) + o(n).
- Optionally, supply numerical checks (e.g. n≈50–200) to confirm lim (1/n) log f_n ≈ V/π ≈ 0.6465.

Summary corrected statement
For q=e^{π i/n} one has
f_n(q) = exp((V/π + o(1)) n),  as n→∞,
where V is the hyperbolic volume of the figure-eight knot. The currently stated coefficient V/(2π) appears to be off by a factor of 2.
