# Problem — Asymptotics at half-angle roots and the figure-eight volume

For $n\in\mathbb{N}$, define the **symmetrized $q$-binomial** using a parameter $v$ by

$$
[m]_v \;=\; \frac{v^{m}-v^{-m}}{v-v^{-1}},\qquad
\qbinom{a}{b}_v \;=\; \frac{[a]_v [a-1]_v \cdots [a-b+1]_v}{[b]_v [b-1]_v \cdots [1]_v},
$$

with the convention that $\qbinom{a}{0}_v=1$ and $\qbinom{a}{b}_v=0$ if $b<0$ or $b>a$.
Set $q=v^2$. For each $n$, define

$$
f_n(q)\;=\;\sum_{i=0}^{n}\qbinom{n+i}{2i}_v .
$$

Let $V$ denote the hyperbolic volume of the figure-eight knot $4_1$ $(V\approx 2.0298832128)$.

**Claim.** With the specialization $q=e^{\pi i/n}$ (equivalently $v=e^{\pi i/(2n)}$), the sequence satisfies the asymptotic

$$
f_n\!\big(e^{\pi i/n}\big)\;=\;\exp\!\Big(\frac{V}{2\pi}\,n + o(n)\Big)\qquad\text{as }n\to\infty.
$$

In words: $f_n(e^{\pi i/n})$ grows like $\exp\!\big(\tfrac{V}{2\pi}n\big)$ as $n\to\infty$.

Set-up at q=exp(π i/n)
- Let v=e^{π i/(2n)} and θ=π/(2n). Then [m]_v=(v^m−v^{-m})/(v−v^{-1})=sin(mθ)/sin θ.
- For 0≤i≤n, the summand is
  C_{n,i}:=\qbinom{n+i}{2i}_v=∏_{k=n-i+1}^{n+i}\frac{\sin(kθ)}{\sin(k−(n−i))?}\Big/∏_{k=1}^{2i}\sin(kθ)=∏_{k=n-i+1}^{n+i} \sin(kθ) / ∏_{k=1}^{2i} \sin(kθ).
  Equivalent cosine form: C_{n,i}=\cos(iθ)∏_{k=1}^{i-1}\cos^2(kθ) / ∏_{k=1}^{2i}\sin(kθ). For 0≤i≤n−1 all factors are positive. As a rational function in v, C_{n,n}=\qbinom{2n}{2n}_v=1.

Variational form
- For i≈αn (α∈[0,1]) one has
  log C_{n,i}=(2n/π)Φ(α)+O(\log n),
  with
  Φ(α)=(1/π)[Λ(π(1−α)/2)+Λ(πα)−Λ(π(1+α)/2)],
  and Λ(x)=−∫_0^x \log(2\sin t) dt. Equivalently, with x=(π/2)α,
  F(x):=Λ(2x)+2Λ(π/2−x), so log C_{n,i}=(2n/π)F(x)+O(\log n).
- Differentiation gives Φ′(α)=\log(\cos(πα/2)/\sin(πα)), hence a unique maximizer at α⋆=1/3 (x⋆=π/6). Strict concavity near α⋆ follows from Φ″(α)<0.

Value at the maximizer and the figure-eight volume
- At x=π/6, F(π/6)=Λ(π/3)+2Λ(π/3)=3Λ(π/3).
- Classical identities give 3Λ(π/3)=Cl_2(π/3)=:v_3 (volume of the regular ideal tetrahedron); the figure‑eight knot has volume V=2v_3. Thus
  max_i log C_{n,i}=(2n/π)·v_3+O(\log n)=(V/π) n+O(\log n).

Consequence for f_n
- Positivity (for i≤n−1) and unimodality (use the ratio R_n(i)=C_{n,i+1}/C_{n,i} and its continuum limit) imply the sum is exponentially governed by its maximal term:
  log f_n(e^{π i/n})=\max_i \log C_{n,i}+o(n)=(V/π) n+o(n).
- Therefore, the original claim with coefficient V/(2π) is off by a factor 2; the correct exponential growth rate is V/π.

To make fully rigorous
- Provide a uniform Euler–Maclaurin (or monotone sum–integral) estimate for S_s(m)=∑_{r=1}^m \log(2\sin(rθ)) and S_c(m)=∑_{k=1}^m \log(2\cos(kθ)) with O(\log n) remainders uniform in i/n on compact subsets of (0,1), along with endpoint handling.
- Prove 3Λ(π/3)=Cl_2(π/3) (e.g., via Clausen identities or a standard reference).
- Carry out a discrete Laplace method using the quadratic behavior of Φ near α⋆ to bound contributions away from i≈n/3.

Numerical check (suggested): (1/n)·log f_n(e^{π i/n}) should approach V/π≈0.64612.

=== Verifier Summary ===

All provers agree on the sine-product reduction and on a 1D Laplace principle with a rate function Φ(α). The unique maximizer is at α=1/3. Evaluating the rate at the maximizer gives F(π/6)=3Λ(π/3). Using the correct geometric normalization v_3=Cl_2(π/3)=3Λ(π/3) and V=2v_3 shows the true exponential rate is V/π, not V/(2π). Prover 1’s final normalization is wrong; Prover 2’s rate and maximizer are right but their V–Λ relation is incorrect; Prover 3 has the correct final exponent. Remaining tasks: rigorous Euler–Maclaurin with uniform O(log n), a precise proof that 3Λ(π/3)=Cl_2(π/3), and a discrete Laplace bound to pass from the maximal summand to the sum.
