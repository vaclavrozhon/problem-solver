{"summary_md":"We rewrote the summand at q=e^{π i/n} (θ=π/(2n)) as C_{n,i}=∏_{k=n-i+1}^{n+i} sin(kθ) / ∏_{k=1}^{2i} sin(kθ), then derived a variational formula log C_{n,i}=(2n/π)Φ(α)+O(log n) for i≈αn with Φ(α)=(1/π)[Λ(π(1−α)/2)+Λ(πα)−Λ(π(1+α)/2)]. Φ′ vanishes uniquely at α⋆=1/3 and Φ″<0, so the maximizer is α⋆. Evaluating at α⋆ gives F(π/6)=3Λ(π/3)=Cl_2(π/3)=:v_3, and since the figure‑eight volume V=2v_3 we obtain max_i log C_{n,i}=(V/π)n+O(log n). Positivity and unimodality imply the sum is dominated by its maximal summand, hence log f_n(e^{π i/n})=(V/π)n+o(n). Thus the original claimed exponent V/(2π) is off by factor 2. Remaining rigorous steps are uniform Euler–Maclaurin, a Clausen identity citation/proof, and a discrete Laplace bound.
