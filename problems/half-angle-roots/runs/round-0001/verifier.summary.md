All provers agree on the sine-product reduction and on a 1D Laplace principle with a rate function Φ(α). The unique maximizer is at α=1/3. Evaluating the rate at the maximizer gives F(π/6)=3Λ(π/3). Using the correct geometric normalization v_3=Cl_2(π/3)=3Λ(π/3) and V=2v_3 shows the true exponential rate is V/π, not V/(2π). Prover 1’s final normalization is wrong; Prover 2’s rate and maximizer are right but their V–Λ relation is incorrect; Prover 3 has the correct final exponent. Remaining tasks: rigorous Euler–Maclaurin with uniform O(log n), a precise proof that 3Λ(π/3)=Cl_2(π/3), and a discrete Laplace bound to pass from the maximal summand to the sum.
