  "feedback_md": "High-level assessment\n- All three provers correctly reduce the evaluation at v=e^{π i/(2n)} to products of sines/cosines and to a 1D Laplace (variational) problem via Euler–Maclaurin/Riemann sum asymptotics. The rate function is consistent across Provers 1 and 2 (modulo notational variants). The index maximizing the rate is i≈n/3. The main discrepancy is in the value of the maximal rate and its normalization against the figure‑eight volume V.\n\nCore technical points that are correct\n- For θ=π/(2n), [m]_v=sin(mθ)/sin θ and\n  C_{n,i}:=qbinom(n+i,2i)_v=∏_{k=n-i+1}^{n+i} sin(kθ) / ∏_{k=1}^{2i} sin(kθ).\n- Equivalently, C_{n,i}=cos(iθ) ∏_{k=1}^{i-1}cos^2(kθ)/∏_{k=1}^{2i}sin(kθ), so for 0≤i≤n−1 all factors are positive; C_{n,n} is finite and equals 1 as a rational function (contrary to Prover 2’s “=0” claim).\n- For i≈αn, one gets log C_{n,i}=(2n/π)F(x)+O(log n) with x:=(π/2)α and F(x)=Λ(2x)+2Λ(π/2−x), where Λ(y)=−∫_0^y log(2 sin t) dt. Equivalently, in α–notation, Φ(α)=(1/π)[Λ(π(1−α)/2)+Λ(πα)−Λ(π(1+α)/2)].\n- The unique maximizer is α⋆=1/3 (x⋆=π/6), by Φ′(α)=log(cos(πα/2)/sin(πα))=0⇔α=1/3; concavity near the maximum is standard.\n\nNormalization against hyperbolic volume\n- At the maximizer, F(π/6)=Λ(π/3)+2Λ(π/3)=3Λ(π/3).\n- With Cl_2 the Clausen function and Λ(x)=(1/2)Cl_2(2x), one has the classical identity 3Λ(π/3)=Cl_2(π/3)=v_3, the volume of the regular ideal tetrahedron; hence V(4_1)=2v_3. (Equivalently, 2 Cl_2(π/3)=3 Cl_2(2π/3).)\n- Therefore the correct maximal exponent is (2/π)·v_3=V/π, not V/(2π) and not 3V/(2π).\n\nWhere each prover stands\n- Prover 1: Derivation of Φ and the maximizer is correct; the final “correction” to force Φ(1/3)=V/(4π) uses a false identity (e.g., “2L(2π/3)−L(4π/3)=v_3/2”). The normalization fix is incorrect. Up to this last step, the analysis is solid.\n- Prover 2: The rate function and maximizer are correct. The conversion to V uses the wrong geometric identity V=4Λ(π/3) (false). With the correct identity v_3=3Λ(π/3), their derivation yields the correct exponent V/π. Also, C_{n,n}≠0; it equals 1.\n- Prover 3: Correctly identifies the contradiction with the given claim and arrives at the exponent V/π. The cited identity 2 Cl_2(π/3)=3 Cl_2(2π/3) is the right way to reconcile constants. Needs rigorous error control, but the outline is on target.\n\nWhat remains to be made rigorous\n1) Uniform Euler–Maclaurin bounds for sums of log(2 sin) and log(2 cos) with O(log n) error, uniform in i/n in compact subsets of (0,1), and endpoint handling (i near 0 or n).\n2) A clean evaluation F(π/6)=v_3 from 3Λ(π/3)=Cl_2(π/3) (cite standard Clausen/Lobachevsky identities or give a short proof).\n3) Discrete Laplace upper bound to pass from max_i C_{n,i} to f_n=∑ C_{n,i}, showing log f_n = max_i log C_{n,i} + o(n). Positivity/unimodality via the ratio R_n(i)=C_{n,i+1}/C_{n,i} is a convenient route.\n\nActionable next steps\n- Formalize the EM lemma with explicit uniform constants; write it once and reuse.\n- Prove unimodality: show R_n(i)>1 for i/n<1/3 and <1 for i/n>1/3 for n large.\n- Record the identity 3Λ(π/3)=Cl_2(π/3) with a reference (e.g., Lewin) or a short derivation via Cl_2 properties.\n- Numerical check: compute (1/n)log f_n(e^{π i/n}) for n≈200,400; it should approach V/π≈0.64612.\n\nConclusion: The claim in the task statement is false by a factor of 2; the correct exponential rate is V/π.",
  "summary_md": "All provers agree on the sine-product reduction and on a 1D Laplace principle with a rate function Φ(α). The unique maximizer is at α=1/3. Evaluating the rate at the maximizer gives F(π/6)=3Λ(π/3). Using the correct geometric normalization v_3=Cl_2(π/3)=3Λ(π/3) and V=2v_3 shows the true exponential rate is V/π, not V/(2π). Prover 1’s final normalization is wrong; Prover 2’s rate and maximizer are right but their V–Λ relation is incorrect; Prover 3 has the correct final exponent. Remaining tasks: rigorous Euler–Maclaurin with uniform O(log n), a precise proof that 3Λ(π/3)=Cl_2(π/3), and a discrete Laplace bound to pass from the maximal summand to the sum.",
