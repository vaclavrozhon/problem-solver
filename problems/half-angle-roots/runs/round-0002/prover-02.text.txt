Ideas
- Make the single-summand asymptotics fully rigorous with a uniform sum–integral estimate for log-sine/log-cosine sums at θ=π/(2n).
- Use this to derive a uniformly valid rate function F(x)=Λ(2x)+2Λ(π/2−x), prove it has a unique maximizer x=π/6 with F(π/6)=v_3=3Λ(π/3), and obtain max_i log C_{n,i}=(2n/π)v_3+O(log n)=(V/π)n+O(log n).
- Use positivity to pass from the maximal summand to the full sum f_n, giving log f_n(e^{π i/n})=(V/π)n+O(log n). This contradicts the original V/(2π) claim by a factor 2.

Setup
Let v=e^{π i/(2n)}, θ=π/(2n). Then [m]_v=(v^m−v^{−m})/(v−v^{−1})=sin(mθ)/sin θ. For 0≤i≤n, set
C_{n,i}:=\qbinom{n+i}{2i}_v.
A standard telescoping gives
C_{n,i}=\prod_{r=1}^{2i}\frac{\sin((n-i+r)θ)}{\sin(rθ)}=\frac{\cos(iθ)\prod_{k=1}^{i-1}\cos^2(kθ)}{\prod_{r=1}^{2i}\sin(rθ)}.
For 0≤i≤n−1, all factors are positive; and C_{n,n}=1 as a rational function of v (the vanishing factors cancel at v^{2n}=−1).

Lemma 1 (Uniform sum–integral estimates).
Let θ∈(0,π/2). Define for integers m≥1
S_s(m):=∑_{r=1}^m \log(2\sin(rθ)), \quad S_c(m):=∑_{k=1}^m \log(2\cos(kθ)).
Fix m with 1≤m≤⌊(π/θ)⌋−1. Then
|S_s(m)−θ^{−1}∫_0^{mθ}\log(2\sin t)dt| ≤ C(1+\log(1/θ)).
If additionally mθ≤\tfrac{π}{2}−θ, then
|S_c(m)−θ^{−1}∫_0^{mθ}\log(2\cos t)dt| ≤ C(1+\log(1/θ)).
Proof (sketch). Write the error as E=∑_{j=1}^m θ^{−1}∫_{(j−1)θ}^{jθ}(f(jθ)−f(t))dt with f(t)=\log(2\sin t) (or f=\log(2\cos t)). Then |E|≤∑_{j=1}^m sup_{u∈[(j−1)θ,jθ]}|f'(u)|. For f=\log(2\sin t), f'(t)=\cot t and ∫_0^{mθ}|\cot t|dt≲1+\log(1/θ). For f=\log(2\cos t) on [0,(\tfrac{π}{2}−θ)], f'(t)=−\tan t and ∫_0^{mθ}\tan t\,dt≲1+\log(1/θ). This yields the claimed bounds (uniform constants C).

Proposition 2 (Uniform asymptotics for a single summand).
Let x:=iθ∈[0,\tfrac{π}{2}−θ]. With Λ(y):=−∫_0^y\log(2\sin t)dt and F(x):=Λ(2x)+2Λ(\tfrac{π}{2}−x),
\log C_{n,i}=\frac{1}{θ}\Big(2∫_0^{x}\log(2\cos t)dt−∫_0^{2x}\log(2\sin t)dt\Big)+O(\log n)=\frac{2n}{π}F(x)+O(\log n),
uniformly for 0≤i≤n−1.
Proof. From the product form,
\log C_{n,i}=2∑_{k=1}^{i-1}\log\cos(kθ)+\log\cos(iθ)−∑_{r=1}^{2i}\log\sin(rθ).
Insert factors 2 (compensated by O(1)), apply Lemma 1 to S_c,S_s, and use ∫_0^x\log(2\cos t)dt=Λ(\tfrac{π}{2}−x).

Proposition 3 (Maximizer and its value).
F'(x)=2(\log(2\cos x)−\log(2\sin 2x)). Hence F'(x)=0⇔\cos x=\sin 2x⇔x=\tfrac{π}{6}. Moreover F''(x)=2(−\tan x−2\cot 2x), so F''(\tfrac{π}{6})=−2\sqrt{3}<0 and x=π/6 is the unique maximizer on (0,π/2). Its value is
F(\tfrac{π}{6})=Λ(\tfrac{π}{3})+2Λ(\tfrac{π}{3})=3Λ(\tfrac{π}{3})=:v_3,
where v_3 is the volume of the regular ideal tetrahedron (by the classical formula Vol(ideal tetra with dihedral angles α,β,γ)=Λ(α)+Λ(β)+Λ(γ)). The figure‑eight volume is V=2v_3.

Corollary 4 (Maximal summand).
max_{0≤i≤n}\log C_{n,i}=\frac{2n}{π}v_3+O(\log n)=\frac{V}{π}n+O(\log n).
Proof. By Proposition 2 and the quadratic behavior of F near x=π/6 (F''(π/6)<0), indices i with |i−n/3|≥n^{2/3} contribute values smaller by c n^{1/3}, hence exponentially negligible; an index with x within θ of π/6 exists and gives the displayed value up to O(\log n).

Proposition 5 (From maximal term to the sum).
For 0≤i≤n−1, C_{n,i}>0 and C_{n,n}=1. Hence
max_i C_{n,i} ≤ f_n(e^{π i/n}) ≤ (n+1)·max_i C_{n,i},
so
\log f_n(e^{π i/n})=\max_i\log C_{n,i}+O(\log n)=\frac{V}{π}n+O(\log n).
In particular,
f_n(e^{π i/n})=\exp\big((V/π)n+o(n)\big).

Examples / sanity checks
- Numerically V/π≈2.0298832128/π≈0.646121…; thus (1/n)\log f_n(e^{π i/n}) should approach ≈0.6461.
- The discrete ratio R_n(i)=C_{n,i+1}/C_{n,i}=[n−i]_v[n+i+1]_v/([2i+1]_v[2i+2]_v) tends, with x=iθ, to (\cos x)^2/(\sin(2x))^2. Hence R_n(i)>1 for x<π/6 and <1 for x>π/6, confirming unimodality and the peak near i≈n/3.

Obstacles
- While Lemma 1 is standard, writing a fully detailed proof with explicit constants uniform in i up to n−1 (including the logarithmic divergence as x→π/2) is still to be formalized in the write-up.
- A tidy treatment of the i=n endpoint (where cancellations occur) has been noted; it is irrelevant to the exponential rate but should be recorded for completeness.

Next steps
- Record a detailed proof of Lemma 1 (split the interval near 0 and near π, then sum bounds on |cot| and |tan| to get the O(log n) remainder).
- Provide a discrete Laplace lemma to bound the total contribution of |i−n/3|≥n^{3/5} by exp(−c n^{1/5}) times the maximum; this yields the O(log n) correction rigorously.
- Add a short reference-proof that v_3=3Λ(π/3) (e.g., via the Bloch–Wigner dilogarithm or Thurston’s formula for ideal tetrahedron volume).
- Optional: determine the pre-exponential factor via a quadratic expansion of F and a local product asymptotic, yielding a √n-type normalization constant.
