Assessment and key correction
- The problem’s stated asymptotic f_n(e^{\pi i/n}) = exp((V/(2\pi)) n + o(n)) is inconsistent with the size of the largest summand. At v = e^{\pi i/(2n)} each summand is nonnegative, so f_n is at least its maximum term. A variational analysis of a single term shows the maximal summand grows like exp((V/\pi + o(1)) n). Hence the claim is off by a factor of 2. The correct exponential rate is V/\pi.

Core derivations to keep (and clarify)
1) Product-of-sines formula at v=e^{\pi i/(2n)}.
- With θ=\pi/(2n), [m]_v=\sin(mθ)/\sin θ. For 0\le i\le n,
  C_{n,i}:=\qbinom{n+i}{2i}_v = \frac{\prod_{k=n-i+1}^{n+i}\sin(kθ)}{\prod_{k=1}^{2i}\sin(kθ)}.
- Alternative “cosine” form (valid for 0\le i\le n−1): C_{n,i}=\cos(iθ)\prod_{k=1}^{i-1}\cos^2(kθ)/\prod_{k=1}^{2i}\sin(kθ). Note: for i=n this form displays a 0/0; use the sine product, which cancels exactly and gives C_{n,n}=1.

2) Variational (Laplace) rate function.
- For i=\lfloor xn\rfloor, x\in[0,1], Euler–Maclaurin/monotone sum–integral estimates yield
  log C_{n,i} = \frac{2n}{\pi} G(x) + O(\log n),
  with G(x)=2\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi x}{2}}\!\log\cos t\,dt − \int_{0}^{\pi x}\!\log\sin t\,dt.
- Equivalently, with the Lobachevsky function Λ(y)=−\int_0^y\log(2\sin t)\,dt,
  G(x)=2Λ\big(\tfrac{\pi}{2}(1−x)\big)+Λ(\pi x).
- Differentiation gives G′(x)=\pi\log\big(\cos(\tfrac{\pi x}{2})/\sin(\pi x)\big). Thus the unique maximizer is x⋆=1/3; G is strictly concave since G″(x)=−\tfrac{\pi}{2}\tan(\tfrac{\pi x}{2})−\pi\cot(\pi x)<0 on (0,1).

3) Value at the maximizer and relation to V.
- At x=1/3, G(1/3)=2\int_0^{\pi/6}\log\cos t\,dt − \int_0^{\pi/3}\log\sin t\,dt = 3Λ(\pi/3).
- Using Λ(y)=\tfrac12 Cl_2(2y) and the classical identity 2 Cl_2(\pi/3)=3 Cl_2(2\pi/3), we get 3Λ(\pi/3)=Cl_2(\pi/3)=:v_3 (volume of the regular ideal tetrahedron). Hence V(4_1)=2 v_3.
- Therefore max_i log C_{n,i} = (2n/\pi) v_3 + O(\log n) = (V/\pi) n + O(\log n).

Immediate consequence for f_n
- Positivity gives max_i C_{n,i} \le f_n \le (n+1) max_i C_{n,i}. Therefore
  log f_n(e^{\pi i/n}) = (V/\pi) n + O(\log n).
- This contradicts the original V/(2\pi) coefficient and pins down the correct exponential rate V/\pi.

Gaps and how to fix them rigorously
1) Specialization at the root of unity.
- Issue: individual [m]_v may vanish (e.g., [2n]_v=0), creating 0/0 in the product. Recommendation: fix the specialization by first rewriting C_{n,i} as the sine-product ratio (which is manifestly regular) and then evaluating at θ=\pi/(2n). Record explicitly that for i=n all zeros cancel and C_{n,n}=1.

2) Uniform sum–integral error bounds.
- Needed lemma: For θ=\pi/(2n) and M\le c n with fixed c<2,
  ∑_{k=1}^M \log(2\sin(kθ)) = \frac{1}{θ}\int_0^{Mθ}\log(2\sin t)\,dt + O(\log n),
  ∑_{k=1}^M \log\cos(kθ) = \frac{1}{θ}\int_0^{Mθ}\log\cos t\,dt + O(\log n),
  uniformly for M\asymp n and also with endpoint handling M\ll n^{1−\varepsilon}. Proof: split off the small-k range where log\sin(kθ)=\log(kθ)+O((kθ)^2) and apply Euler–Maclaurin on [k_0,M] where the integrands are smooth and bounded away from singularities. This justifies the O(\log n) remainders uniformly in x=i/n\in[0,1].

3) Peak location and unimodality (optional for upper bound, useful structurally).
- Define the ratio R_n(i)=C_{n,i+1}/C_{n,i}. From the sine product,
  R_n(i)=\frac{\sin((n−i)θ)\,\sin((n+i+1)θ)}{\sin((2i+1)θ)\,\sin((2i+2)θ)}=\frac{\cos(iθ)\,\cos((i+1)θ)}{\sin((2i+1)θ)\,\sin((2i+2)θ)}.
- For i/n<1/3−\delta, R_n(i)>1 for n large; for i/n>1/3+\delta, R_n(i)<1. This gives unimodality with the peak at i=\lfloor n/3\rfloor+O(1). Though not strictly needed for the O(\log n) error (since f_n\le(n+1)\max C_{n,i}), including it strengthens the narrative and enables a Gaussian-window refinement if desired.

4) Clausen/Lobachevsky identities and references.
- State explicitly: Λ(y)=\tfrac12 Cl_2(2y), v_3=Cl_2(\pi/3), 2 Cl_2(\pi/3)=3 Cl_2(2\pi/3), and V(4_1)=2 v_3. Cite standard references (e.g., Lewin’s Polylogarithms, or Milnor’s notes on hyperbolic geometry) or include a short derivation using the duplication/multiplication formulas for Cl_2.

Suggested structure for the cleaned proof
- Step 1: Sine-product identity and positivity; special case i=n handled.
- Step 2: Define G(x) and prove the uniform approximation log C_{n,\lfloor xn\rfloor}=(2n/\pi)G(x)+O(\log n).
- Step 3: Analyze G: strict concavity, unique maximizer x⋆=1/3, evaluate G(1/3)=3Λ(\pi/3)=v_3.
- Step 4: Bounds for the sum: max-term lower bound and trivial (n+1)×max upper bound yield log f_n=(V/\pi)n+O(\log n).
- Step 5 (optional): Unimodality via R_n(i) and a discrete Laplace method for a refined O(\log n) constant.

Actionable next steps
- Write and prove the uniform Euler–Maclaurin lemma for ∑ log(2 sin) and ∑ log cos with explicit constants.
- Record and justify the Clausen/Lobachevsky identities used to evaluate G(1/3).
- Add a short lemma verifying R_n(i) criterion and the uniqueness of the peak near n/3.
- Include a brief numeric check: (1/n) log f_n(e^{\pi i/n}) should approach V/\pi≈0.646409..., while V/(2\pi)≈0.323204..., confirming the factor-of-2 correction.

Conclusion
- The current claim is incorrect; the correct main result is
  f_n(e^{\pi i/n}) = \exp\big((V/\pi)\,n + O(\log n)\big).
- The notes already contain the right variational framework; the proof needs uniform sum–integral error control, a careful treatment of the i=n endpoint, and explicit Clausen/Lobachevsky conversions to tie the maximizer value to V.
