We rewrote the summand at q=e^{π i/n} (θ=π/(2n)) as C_{n,i}=∏_{k=n-i+1}^{n+i} sin(kθ)/∏_{k=1}^{2i} sin(kθ) and derived the variational form log C_{n,i}=(2n/π)Φ(α)+O(log n) for i≈αn with Φ(α) given via Λ(x)=−∫_0^x log(2 sin t) dt. Φ has a unique maximizer at α⋆=1/3 (x⋆=π/6). Evaluating at the maximizer gives F(π/6)=3Λ(π/3)=Cl_2(π/3)=:v_3, and since the figure‑eight volume V=2v_3 we obtain max_i log C_{n,i}=(V/π)n+O(log n). Positivity/unimodality then imply the sum is dominated by its maximal summand, so log f_n(e^{π i/n})=(V/π)n+o(n). Hence the original claimed rate V/(2π) is off by factor 2. Remaining rigorous tasks are uniform sum–integral (Euler–Maclaurin) error control and a discrete Laplace localization to pass from max summand to the sum.
