{"summary_md":"We rewrote the summand at q=e^{π i/n} (θ=π/(2n)) as C_{n,i}=∏_{k=n-i+1}^{n+i} sin(kθ)/∏_{k=1}^{2i} sin(kθ) and derived the variational form log C_{n,i}=(2n/π)Φ(α)+O(log n) for i≈αn with Φ(α) given via Λ(x)=−∫_0^x log(2 sin t) dt. Φ has a unique maximizer at α⋆=1/3 (x⋆=π/6). Evaluating at the maximizer gives F(π/6)=3Λ(π/3)=Cl_2(π/3)=:v_3, and since the figure‑eight volume V=2v_3 we obtain max_i log C_{n,i}=(V/π)n+O(log n). Positivity/unimodality then imply the sum is dominated by its maximal summand, so log f_n(e^{π i/n})=(V/π)n+o(n). Hence the original claimed rate V/(2π) is off by factor 2. Remaining rigorous tasks are uniform sum–integral (Euler–Maclaurin) error control and a discrete Laplace localization to pass from max summand to the sum.","one_line_summary":"f_n(e^{π i/n}) grows like exp((V/π)n), not exp((V/2π)n).","highlights":["Sine-product reduction: C_{n,i}=∏_{k=n-i+1}^{n+i} sin(kθ)/∏_{k=1}^{2i} sin(kθ) with θ=π/(2n).","Rate function: log C_{n,i}=(2n/π)Φ(α)+O(log n) for i≈αn, where Φ arises from Λ(x)=−∫_0^x log(2 sin t) dt.","Unique maximizer at α⋆=1/3 (x⋆=π/6); strict concavity near the maximizer.","Value at maximizer: F(π/6)=3Λ(π/3)=Cl_2(π/3)=v_3, and V(4_1)=2v_3, giving max log C=(V/π)n+O(log n).","Positivity and unimodality imply the sum is exponentially governed by the maximal summand, so log f_n(e^{π i/n})=(V/π)n+o(n)."],"next_questions":["Provide uniform Euler–Maclaurin / monotone sum–integral estimates for ∑ log(2 sin(rθ)) and ∑ log(2 cos(kθ)) with O(log n) remainders uniform in α on compacts.","Give a short citation/proof of 3Λ(π/3)=Cl_2(π/3) and record V=2·Cl_2(π/3).","Carry out a discrete Laplace (quadratic expansion) around α⋆ to bound contributions away from i≈n/3 and extract possible prefactors; perform numerical verification that (1/n)log f_n→V/π."]}
