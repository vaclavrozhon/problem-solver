=== SYSTEM ===
You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md, proofs.md, and output.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers
- notes.md (informal progress & exploratory work so far)
- proofs.md (rigorous proofs & detailed mathematics so far)
- output.md (main results found so far)

**Three-tier file system guidelines**:
- **notes.md**: Readable, log of exploratory work, intuitions, failed attempts, ideas. Prefer appending. Replace only if old notes are clearly misleading. It should be self-contained: In particular, reading it should make sense without knowing the output of provers in past rounds. 

- **proofs.md**: Complete rigorous mathematical proofs with full details. Think twice before adding anything. Contains proven lemmas, theorems, and detailed derivations. Only add mathematically verified content here.
- **output.md**: This is the only file that the user is supposed to read in case your verdict is "promising". It has to be self-contained. It contains ONLY the main problem results, and a discussion why they are relevant. It is extremely selective. Think twice before promoting proofs from proofs.md to output.md. Only if the result marks clear progress on the problem, and only if the proof in proofs.md has been thoroughly vetted by provers and you, it can join output.md. Each result must be followed by a rigorous, self-contained proof that properly defines all objects of interest and is essentially publication-ready. 

Tasks:
1) Audit rigor: identify unjustified steps, false statements, missing lemmas; produce minimal counterexamples.
2) Triage value: separate genuine progress from noise.
3) Guide next steps: propose what provers should try next.

# Problem — Asymptotics at half-angle roots and the figure-eight volume

For $n\in\mathbb{N}$, define the **symmetrized $q$-binomial** using a parameter $v$ by

$$
[m]_v \;=\; \frac{v^{m}-v^{-m}}{v-v^{-1}},\qquad
\qbinom{a}{b}_v \;=\; \frac{[a]_v [a-1]_v \cdots [a-b+1]_v}{[b]_v [b-1]_v \cdots [1]_v},
$$

with the convention that $\qbinom{a}{0}_v=1$ and $\qbinom{a}{b}_v=0$ if $b<0$ or $b>a$.
Set $q=v^2$. For each $n$, define

$$
f_n(q)\;=\;\sum_{i=0}^{n}\qbinom{n+i}{2i}_v .
$$

Let $V$ denote the hyperbolic volume of the figure-eight knot $4_1$ $(V\approx 2.0298832128)$.

**Claim.** With the specialization $q=e^{\pi i/n}$ (equivalently $v=e^{\pi i/(2n)}$), the sequence satisfies the asymptotic

$$
f_n\!\big(e^{\pi i/n}\big)\;=\;\exp\!\Big(\frac{V}{2\pi}\,n + o(n)\Big)\qquad\text{as }n\to\infty.
$$

In words: $f_n(e^{\pi i/n})$ grows like $\exp\!\big(\tfrac{V}{2\pi}n\big)$ as $n\to\infty$.

# Research Notes



Set-up at q=exp(π i/n)
- Let v=e^{π i/(2n)} and θ=π/(2n). Then [m]_v=(v^m−v^{-m})/(v−v^{-1})=sin(mθ)/sin θ.
- For 0≤i≤n, the summand is
  C_{n,i}:=\qbinom{n+i}{2i}_v=∏_{k=n-i+1}^{n+i}\frac{\sin(kθ)}{\sin(k−(n−i))?}\Big/∏_{k=1}^{2i}\sin(kθ)=∏_{k=n-i+1}^{n+i} \sin(kθ) / ∏_{k=1}^{2i} \sin(kθ).
  Equivalent cosine form: C_{n,i}=\cos(iθ)∏_{k=1}^{i-1}\cos^2(kθ) / ∏_{k=1}^{2i}\sin(kθ). For 0≤i≤n−1 all factors are positive. As a rational function in v, C_{n,n}=\qbinom{2n}{2n}_v=1.

Variational form
- For i≈αn (α∈[0,1]) one has
  log C_{n,i}=(2n/π)Φ(α)+O(\log n),
  with
  Φ(α)=(1/π)[Λ(π(1−α)/2)+Λ(πα)−Λ(π(1+α)/2)],
  and Λ(x)=−∫_0^x \log(2\sin t) dt. Equivalently, with x=(π/2)α,
  F(x):=Λ(2x)+2Λ(π/2−x), so log C_{n,i}=(2n/π)F(x)+O(\log n).
- Differentiation gives Φ′(α)=\log(\cos(πα/2)/\sin(πα)), hence a unique maximizer at α⋆=1/3 (x⋆=π/6). Strict concavity near α⋆ follows from Φ″(α)<0.

Value at the maximizer and the figure-eight volume
- At x=π/6, F(π/6)=Λ(π/3)+2Λ(π/3)=3Λ(π/3).
- Classical identities give 3Λ(π/3)=Cl_2(π/3)=:v_3 (volume of the regular ideal tetrahedron); the figure‑eight knot has volume V=2v_3. Thus
  max_i log C_{n,i}=(2n/π)·v_3+O(\log n)=(V/π) n+O(\log n).

Consequence for f_n
- Positivity (for i≤n−1) and unimodality (use the ratio R_n(i)=C_{n,i+1}/C_{n,i} and its continuum limit) imply the sum is exponentially governed by its maximal term:
  log f_n(e^{π i/n})=\max_i \log C_{n,i}+o(n)=(V/π) n+o(n).
- Therefore, the original claim with coefficient V/(2π) is off by a factor 2; the correct exponential growth rate is V/π.

To make fully rigorous
- Provide a uniform Euler–Maclaurin (or monotone sum–integral) estimate for S_s(m)=∑_{r=1}^m \log(2\sin(rθ)) and S_c(m)=∑_{k=1}^m \log(2\cos(kθ)) with O(\log n) remainders uniform in i/n on compact subsets of (0,1), along with endpoint handling.
- Prove 3Λ(π/3)=Cl_2(π/3) (e.g., via Clausen identities or a standard reference).
- Carry out a discrete Laplace method using the quadratic behavior of Φ near α⋆ to bound contributions away from i≈n/3.

Numerical check (suggested): (1/n)·log f_n(e^{π i/n}) should approach V/π≈0.64612.

Ideas
- Use the sine-product expression at v=e^{π i/(2n)} to reduce each summand to an exponential scale via Euler–Maclaurin. This gives a rate function Φ(α) whose maximizer determines the exponential growth.
- Prove that the unique maximizer is at α⋆=1/3 and evaluate Φ(α⋆) in terms of the Lobachevsky/Clausen function, matching v_3=Vol(regular ideal tetrahedron)=Cl_2(π/3)=3Λ(π/3) and V(4_1)=2v_3.
- Use positivity of the summands to sandwich f_n between its maximal term and (n+1) times the maximal term, yielding an O(log n) error and the sharp exponent (V/π)n.

Sine representation and positivity (rigorous)
Let θ:=π/(2n). Then [m]_v=sin(mθ)/sin θ and, for 0≤i≤n,
  
  C_{n,i}:=\qbinom{n+i}{2i}_v=∏_{k=n-i+1}^{n+i} \frac{\sin(kθ)}{\sin(kθ)}\Big/∏_{k=1}^{2i}\sin(kθ)=\frac{∏_{k=n-i+1}^{n+i}\sin(kθ)}{∏_{k=1}^{2i}\sin(kθ)}.
  
Equivalently, using sin(π/2±x)=cos x,
  
  C_{n,i}=\frac{\cos(iθ)\prod_{k=1}^{i-1}\cos^2(kθ)}{\prod_{k=1}^{2i}\sin(kθ)}.
  
Hence C_{n,i}>0 for 0≤i≤n−1, and C_{n,n}=1 as a rational function in v (limit interpretation at k=2n).

Uniform Euler–Maclaurin for log-sine sums (Lemma A)
Define S(m):=∑_{k=1}^m \log(2\sin(kθ)) for 1≤m≤2n−1. Then, uniformly for m in [1,2n−1],
  
  S(m)=\frac{1}{θ}\,Λ(mθ) + E(m),\quad Λ(x):=−\int_0^{x}\log(2\sin u)\,du,\quad E(m)=O(\log n).
  
Sketch of proof: Apply one-step Euler–Maclaurin to f(u)=\log(2\sin u) on [θ,mθ]; the derivative f′(u)=\cot u has integrable singularities, and ∫_{θ}^{mθ}|\cot u|du≲\log\frac{1}{\sin θ}+\log\frac{1}{\sin(\min\{mθ,\pi−mθ\})}=O(\log n). The endpoint half-sum terms are O(1). This yields E(m)=O(\log n), uniformly in m.

Rate function and its maximizer (Lemma B)
For i=⌊α n⌋ with α∈[0,1], combining S(n+i), S(n−i), S(2i) and Lemma A gives
  
  \log C_{n,i}=\frac{2n}{\pi}J(\alpha)+O(\log n),\quad J(\alpha)=\int_{\tfrac{\pi}{2}(1−\alpha)}^{\tfrac{\pi}{2}(1+\alpha)}\!\log\sin u\,du\;−\int_{0}^{\pi\alpha}\!\log\sin u\,du.
  
Equivalently, with Λ as above,
  
  Φ(\alpha):=\frac{1}{\pi}[Λ(\tfrac{\pi}{2}(1−\alpha)) + Λ(\pi\alpha) − Λ(\tfrac{\pi}{2}(1+\alpha))],\quad \log C_{n,i}=2n\,Φ(\alpha)+O(\log n),
  
uniformly for α in compact subsets of (0,1). Differentiating using Λ′(x)=−\log(2\sin x):
  
  Φ′(\alpha)=\log\frac{\cos(\tfrac{\pi\alpha}{2})}{\sin(\pi\alpha)},\quad Φ″(\alpha)=−\frac{\pi}{2}\tan\frac{\pi\alpha}{2}−\pi\cot(\pi\alpha).
  
Thus Φ′(\alpha)=0 iff \cos(\tfrac{\pi\alpha}{2})=\sin(\pi\alpha)=2\sin(\tfrac{\pi\alpha}{2})\cos(\tfrac{\pi\alpha}{2}), i.e. \sin(\tfrac{\pi\alpha}{2})=\tfrac12, giving the unique critical point α⋆=1/3. Since Φ″(\alpha)<0 on (0,1/2), in particular Φ″(1/3)=−\tfrac{\pi\sqrt{3}}{2}<0, α⋆ is the unique global maximizer.

Exact value at the maximizer (Lemma C)
Set x=\tfrac{\pi}{6}. Using F(x):=Λ(2x)+2Λ(\tfrac{\pi}{2}−x), we have Φ(1/3)=(1/\pi)F(\pi/6) and F(\pi/6)=Λ(\pi/3)+2Λ(\pi/3)=3Λ(\pi/3).
Classically, the volume v_3 of the regular ideal tetrahedron equals v_3=Cl_2(\pi/3)=3Λ(\pi/3), and the figure-eight volume is V=2v_3. Hence
  
  Φ(1/3)=\frac{v_3}{\pi}=\frac{V}{2\pi}.
  
References: Milnor (Hyperbolic geometry), Neumann–Zagier (Volumes of hyperbolic three-manifolds), Lewin (Polylogarithms), using Cl_2(2x)=2Λ(x) and the identity 2Cl_2(\pi/3)=3Cl_2(2\pi/3).

Asymptotics for f_n (Proposition)
For all i, \log C_{n,i}=2n Φ(i/n)+O(\log n). Thus
  
  \max_{0≤i≤n}\log C_{n,i}=2n\max_{α∈[0,1]}Φ(α)+O(\log n)=2n Φ(1/3)+O(\log n)=\frac{V}{\pi}n+O(\log n).
  
Since C_{n,i}≥0, we have
  
  \max_i C_{n,i} ≤ f_n(e^{\pi i/n}) ≤ (n+1)\max_i C_{n,i},
  
so
  
  \log f_n(e^{\pi i/n})=\frac{V}{\pi}n+O(\log n).
  
In particular, the exponential growth rate is V/π, not V/(2π).

Ratio test and unimodality (auxiliary, optional)
An exact ratio is
  
  R_n(i):=\frac{C_{n,i+1}}{C_{n,i}}=\frac{\sin((n−i)θ)\sin((n+i+1)θ)}{\sin((2i+1)θ)\sin((2i+2)θ)}=\frac{\cos(iθ)\cos((i+1)θ)}{\sin((2i+1)θ)\sin((2i+2)θ)}.
  
For i=⌊α n⌋, R_n(i)=\exp(Φ′(\alpha)+o(1)), so R_n(i)>1 for α<1/3 and R_n(i)<1 for α>1/3 for n large, implying unimodality with peak near i≈n/3. This is not needed for the O(log n) precision above but useful for local limit refinements.

Numerical check (suggested)
Compute a_n:=(1/n)\log f_n(e^{\pi i/n}). Then a_n→V/π≈0.64626. Even modest n (e.g. n=200,400) should exhibit close agreement.

Obstacles and next steps
- Fill in full details of Lemma A with explicit constants and endpoint handling; the O(\log n) bound is standard but should be written carefully.
- Record a self-contained proof or a precise citation for 3Λ(\pi/3)=Cl_2(\pi/3) and V=2v_3.
- Refine to a second-order asymptotic: show f_n(e^{\pi i/n})∼K\,n^{1/2}\exp((V/\pi)n), compute K from Φ″(1/3) and subleading Euler–Maclaurin terms.


=== Prover 2 Output ===

Ideas
- Make the single-summand asymptotics fully rigorous with a uniform sum–integral estimate for log-sine/log-cosine sums at θ=π/(2n).
- Use this to derive a uniformly valid rate function F(x)=Λ(2x)+2Λ(π/2−x), prove it has a unique maximizer x=π/6 with F(π/6)=v_3=3Λ(π/3), and obtain max_i log C_{n,i}=(2n/π)v_3+O(log n)=(V/π)n+O(log n).
- Use positivity to pass from the maximal summand to the full sum f_n, giving log f_n(e^{π i/n})=(V/π)n+O(log n). This contradicts the original V/(2π) claim by a factor 2.

Setup
Let v=e^{π i/(2n)}, θ=π/(2n). Then [m]_v=(v^m−v^{−m})/(v−v^{−1})=sin(mθ)/sin θ. For 0≤i≤n, set
C_{n,i}:=\qbinom{n+i}{2i}_v.
A standard telescoping gives
C_{n,i}=\prod_{r=1}^{2i}\frac{\sin((n-i+r)θ)}{\sin(rθ)}=\frac{\cos(iθ)\prod_{k=1}^{i-1}\cos^2(kθ)}{\prod_{r=1}^{2i}\sin(rθ)}.
For 0≤i≤n−1, all factors are positive; and C_{n,n}=1 as a rational function of v (the vanishing factors cancel at v^{2n}=−1).

Lemma 1 (Uniform sum–integral estimates).
Let θ∈(0,π/2). Define for integers m≥1
S_s(m):=∑_{r=1}^m \log(2\sin(rθ)), \quad S_c(m):=∑_{k=1}^m \log(2\cos(kθ)).
Fix m with 1≤m≤⌊(π/θ)⌋−1. Then
|S_s(m)−θ^{−1}∫_0^{mθ}\log(2\sin t)dt| ≤ C(1+\log(1/θ)).
If additionally mθ≤\tfrac{π}{2}−θ, then
|S_c(m)−θ^{−1}∫_0^{mθ}\log(2\cos t)dt| ≤ C(1+\log(1/θ)).
Proof (sketch). Write the error as E=∑_{j=1}^m θ^{−1}∫_{(j−1)θ}^{jθ}(f(jθ)−f(t))dt with f(t)=\log(2\sin t) (or f=\log(2\cos t)). Then |E|≤∑_{j=1}^m sup_{u∈[(j−1)θ,jθ]}|f'(u)|. For f=\log(2\sin t), f'(t)=\cot t and ∫_0^{mθ}|\cot t|dt≲1+\log(1/θ). For f=\log(2\cos t) on [0,(\tfrac{π}{2}−θ)], f'(t)=−\tan t and ∫_0^{mθ}\tan t\,dt≲1+\log(1/θ). This yields the claimed bounds (uniform constants C).

Proposition 2 (Uniform asymptotics for a single summand).
Let x:=iθ∈[0,\tfrac{π}{2}−θ]. With Λ(y):=−∫_0^y\log(2\sin t)dt and F(x):=Λ(2x)+2Λ(\tfrac{π}{2}−x),
\log C_{n,i}=\frac{1}{θ}\Big(2∫_0^{x}\log(2\cos t)dt−∫_0^{2x}\log(2\sin t)dt\Big)+O(\log n)=\frac{2n}{π}F(x)+O(\log n),
uniformly for 0≤i≤n−1.
Proof. From the product form,
\log C_{n,i}=2∑_{k=1}^{i-1}\log\cos(kθ)+\log\cos(iθ)−∑_{r=1}^{2i}\log\sin(rθ).
Insert factors 2 (compensated by O(1)), apply Lemma 1 to S_c,S_s, and use ∫_0^x\log(2\cos t)dt=Λ(\tfrac{π}{2}−x).

Proposition 3 (Maximizer and its value).
F'(x)=2(\log(2\cos x)−\log(2\sin 2x)). Hence F'(x)=0⇔\cos x=\sin 2x⇔x=\tfrac{π}{6}. Moreover F''(x)=2(−\tan x−2\cot 2x), so F''(\tfrac{π}{6})=−2\sqrt{3}<0 and x=π/6 is the unique maximizer on (0,π/2). Its value is
F(\tfrac{π}{6})=Λ(\tfrac{π}{3})+2Λ(\tfrac{π}{3})=3Λ(\tfrac{π}{3})=:v_3,
where v_3 is the volume of the regular ideal tetrahedron (by the classical formula Vol(ideal tetra with dihedral angles α,β,γ)=Λ(α)+Λ(β)+Λ(γ)). The figure‑eight volume is V=2v_3.

Corollary 4 (Maximal summand).
max_{0≤i≤n}\log C_{n,i}=\frac{2n}{π}v_3+O(\log n)=\frac{V}{π}n+O(\log n).
Proof. By Proposition 2 and the quadratic behavior of F near x=π/6 (F''(π/6)<0), indices i with |i−n/3|≥n^{2/3} contribute values smaller by c n^{1/3}, hence exponentially negligible; an index with x within θ of π/6 exists and gives the displayed value up to O(\log n).

Proposition 5 (From maximal term to the sum).
For 0≤i≤n−1, C_{n,i}>0 and C_{n,n}=1. Hence
max_i C_{n,i} ≤ f_n(e^{π i/n}) ≤ (n+1)·max_i C_{n,i},
so
\log f_n(e^{π i/n})=\max_i\log C_{n,i}+O(\log n)=\frac{V}{π}n+O(\log n).
In particular,
f_n(e^{π i/n})=\exp\big((V/π)n+o(n)\big).

Examples / sanity checks
- Numerically V/π≈2.0298832128/π≈0.646121…; thus (1/n)\log f_n(e^{π i/n}) should approach ≈0.6461.
- The discrete ratio R_n(i)=C_{n,i+1}/C_{n,i}=[n−i]_v[n+i+1]_v/([2i+1]_v[2i+2]_v) tends, with x=iθ, to (\cos x)^2/(\sin(2x))^2. Hence R_n(i)>1 for x<π/6 and <1 for x>π/6, confirming unimodality and the peak near i≈n/3.

Obstacles
- While Lemma 1 is standard, writing a fully detailed proof with explicit constants uniform in i up to n−1 (including the logarithmic divergence as x→π/2) is still to be formalized in the write-up.
- A tidy treatment of the i=n endpoint (where cancellations occur) has been noted; it is irrelevant to the exponential rate but should be recorded for completeness.

Next steps
- Record a detailed proof of Lemma 1 (split the interval near 0 and near π, then sum bounds on |cot| and |tan| to get the O(log n) remainder).
- Provide a discrete Laplace lemma to bound the total contribution of |i−n/3|≥n^{3/5} by exp(−c n^{1/5}) times the maximum; this yields the O(log n) correction rigorously.
- Add a short reference-proof that v_3=3Λ(π/3) (e.g., via the Bloch–Wigner dilogarithm or Thurston’s formula for ideal tetrahedron volume).
- Optional: determine the pre-exponential factor via a quadratic expansion of F and a local product asymptotic, yielding a √n-type normalization constant.


=== Prover 3 Output ===

Assessment and key correction
- The problem’s stated asymptotic f_n(e^{\pi i/n}) = exp((V/(2\pi)) n + o(n)) is inconsistent with the size of the largest summand. At v = e^{\pi i/(2n)} each summand is nonnegative, so f_n is at least its maximum term. A variational analysis of a single term shows the maximal summand grows like exp((V/\pi + o(1)) n). Hence the claim is off by a factor of 2. The correct exponential rate is V/\pi.

Core derivations to keep (and clarify)
1) Product-of-sines formula at v=e^{\pi i/(2n)}.
- With θ=\pi/(2n), [m]_v=\sin(mθ)/\sin θ. For 0\le i\le n,
  C_{n,i}:=\qbinom{n+i}{2i}_v = \frac{\prod_{k=n-i+1}^{n+i}\sin(kθ)}{\prod_{k=1}^{2i}\sin(kθ)}.
- Alternative “cosine” form (valid for 0\le i\le n−1): C_{n,i}=\cos(iθ)\prod_{k=1}^{i-1}\cos^2(kθ)/\prod_{k=1}^{2i}\sin(kθ). Note: for i=n this form displays a 0/0; use the sine product, which cancels exactly and gives C_{n,n}=1.

2) Variational (Laplace) rate function.
- For i=\lfloor xn\rfloor, x\in[0,1], Euler–Maclaurin/monotone sum–integral estimates yield
  log C_{n,i} = \frac{2n}{\pi} G(x) + O(\log n),
  with G(x)=2\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi x}{2}}\!\log\cos t\,dt − \int_{0}^{\pi x}\!\log\sin t\,dt.
- Equivalently, with the Lobachevsky function Λ(y)=−\int_0^y\log(2\sin t)\,dt,
  G(x)=2Λ\big(\tfrac{\pi}{2}(1−x)\big)+Λ(\pi x).
- Differentiation gives G′(x)=\pi\log\big(\cos(\tfrac{\pi x}{2})/\sin(\pi x)\big). Thus the unique maximizer is x⋆=1/3; G is strictly concave since G″(x)=−\tfrac{\pi}{2}\tan(\tfrac{\pi x}{2})−\pi\cot(\pi x)<0 on (0,1).

3) Value at the maximizer and relation to V.
- At x=1/3, G(1/3)=2\int_0^{\pi/6}\log\cos t\,dt − \int_0^{\pi/3}\log\sin t\,dt = 3Λ(\pi/3).
- Using Λ(y)=\tfrac12 Cl_2(2y) and the classical identity 2 Cl_2(\pi/3)=3 Cl_2(2\pi/3), we get 3Λ(\pi/3)=Cl_2(\pi/3)=:v_3 (volume of the regular ideal tetrahedron). Hence V(4_1)=2 v_3.
- Therefore max_i log C_{n,i} = (2n/\pi) v_3 + O(\log n) = (V/\pi) n + O(\log n).

Immediate consequence for f_n
- Positivity gives max_i C_{n,i} \le f_n \le (n+1) max_i C_{n,i}. Therefore
  log f_n(e^{\pi i/n}) = (V/\pi) n + O(\log n).
- This contradicts the original V/(2\pi) coefficient and pins down the correct exponential rate V/\pi.

Gaps and how to fix them rigorously
1) Specialization at the root of unity.
- Issue: individual [m]_v may vanish (e.g., [2n]_v=0), creating 0/0 in the product. Recommendation: fix the specialization by first rewriting C_{n,i} as the sine-product ratio (which is manifestly regular) and then evaluating at θ=\pi/(2n). Record explicitly that for i=n all zeros cancel and C_{n,n}=1.

2) Uniform sum–integral error bounds.
- Needed lemma: For θ=\pi/(2n) and M\le c n with fixed c<2,
  ∑_{k=1}^M \log(2\sin(kθ)) = \frac{1}{θ}\int_0^{Mθ}\log(2\sin t)\,dt + O(\log n),
  ∑_{k=1}^M \log\cos(kθ) = \frac{1}{θ}\int_0^{Mθ}\log\cos t\,dt + O(\log n),
  uniformly for M\asymp n and also with endpoint handling M\ll n^{1−\varepsilon}. Proof: split off the small-k range where log\sin(kθ)=\log(kθ)+O((kθ)^2) and apply Euler–Maclaurin on [k_0,M] where the integrands are smooth and bounded away from singularities. This justifies the O(\log n) remainders uniformly in x=i/n\in[0,1].

3) Peak location and unimodality (optional for upper bound, useful structurally).
- Define the ratio R_n(i)=C_{n,i+1}/C_{n,i}. From the sine product,
  R_n(i)=\frac{\sin((n−i)θ)\,\sin((n+i+1)θ)}{\sin((2i+1)θ)\,\sin((2i+2)θ)}=\frac{\cos(iθ)\,\cos((i+1)θ)}{\sin((2i+1)θ)\,\sin((2i+2)θ)}.
- For i/n<1/3−\delta, R_n(i)>1 for n large; for i/n>1/3+\delta, R_n(i)<1. This gives unimodality with the peak at i=\lfloor n/3\rfloor+O(1). Though not strictly needed for the O(\log n) error (since f_n\le(n+1)\max C_{n,i}), including it strengthens the narrative and enables a Gaussian-window refinement if desired.

4) Clausen/Lobachevsky identities and references.
- State explicitly: Λ(y)=\tfrac12 Cl_2(2y), v_3=Cl_2(\pi/3), 2 Cl_2(\pi/3)=3 Cl_2(2\pi/3), and V(4_1)=2 v_3. Cite standard references (e.g., Lewin’s Polylogarithms, or Milnor’s notes on hyperbolic geometry) or include a short derivation using the duplication/multiplication formulas for Cl_2.

Suggested structure for the cleaned proof
- Step 1: Sine-product identity and positivity; special case i=n handled.
- Step 2: Define G(x) and prove the uniform approximation log C_{n,\lfloor xn\rfloor}=(2n/\pi)G(x)+O(\log n).
- Step 3: Analyze G: strict concavity, unique maximizer x⋆=1/3, evaluate G(1/3)=3Λ(\pi/3)=v_3.
- Step 4: Bounds for the sum: max-term lower bound and trivial (n+1)×max upper bound yield log f_n=(V/\pi)n+O(\log n).
- Step 5 (optional): Unimodality via R_n(i) and a discrete Laplace method for a refined O(\log n) constant.

Actionable next steps
- Write and prove the uniform Euler–Maclaurin lemma for ∑ log(2 sin) and ∑ log cos with explicit constants.
- Record and justify the Clausen/Lobachevsky identities used to evaluate G(1/3).
- Add a short lemma verifying R_n(i) criterion and the uniqueness of the peak near n/3.
- Include a brief numeric check: (1/n) log f_n(e^{\pi i/n}) should approach V/\pi≈0.646409..., while V/(2\pi)≈0.323204..., confirming the factor-of-2 correction.

Conclusion
- The current claim is incorrect; the correct main result is
  f_n(e^{\pi i/n}) = \exp\big((V/\pi)\,n + O(\log n)\big).
- The notes already contain the right variational framework; the proof needs uniform sum–integral error control, a careful treatment of the i=n endpoint, and explicit Clausen/Lobachevsky conversions to tie the maximizer value to V.
