          "text": "{\"feedback_md\":\"Overall: All three provers correctly reduce the problem at q=e^{\u03c0 i/n} (v=e^{\u03c0 i/(2n)}) to products of sines/cosines and a one-dimensional Laplace principle. They agree on a unique maximizer at i\u2248n/3. The remaining friction is normalization against the figure\u2011eight volume and rigor of the sum\u2013integral estimates. The consensus now is that the original claim is off by a factor 2; the correct exponential rate is V/\u03c0.\\n\\nTechnical audit\\n- Sine-product reduction: Sound. For \u03b8=\u03c0/(2n), [m]_v=sin(m\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 and C_{n,i}=[n+i choose 2i]_v equals \u220f_{k=n\u2212i+1}^{n+i} sin(k\u03b8)/\u220f_{k=1}^{2i} sin(k\u03b8). An equivalent cosine form holds: C_{n,i}=cos(i\u03b8)\u220f_{k=1}^{i\u22121}cos^2(k\u03b8)/\u220f_{k=1}^{2i}sin(k\u03b8). For 0\u2264i\u2264n\u22121, C_{n,i}>0. At i=n, cancellations give C_{n,n}=1 (not 0). Please correct the minor misprint in Notes where an extra \u201csin(k\u2212(n\u2212i))?\u201d appears.\\n- Rate function: For i=\u03b1n, log C_{n,i}=(2n/\u03c0)F(x)+O(log n) with x=(\u03c0/2)\u03b1 and F(x)=\u039b(2x)+2\u039b(\u03c0/2\u2212x), \u039b(y)=\u2212\u222b_0^y log(2 sin t)dt. Derivative analysis gives a unique maximizer at \u03b1=1/3 (x=\u03c0/6). This is consistent across provers; the calculus and sign checks are correct.\\n- Value at maximizer: F(\u03c0/6)=\u039b(\u03c0/3)+2\u039b(\u03c0/3)=3\u039b(\u03c0/3). Using v_3=Vol(regular ideal tetrahedron)=Cl_2(\u03c0/3)=3\u039b(\u03c0/3) and V(4_1)=2v_3, we obtain max_i log C_{n,i}=(2n/\u03c0)v_3=(V/\u03c0)n up to O(log n). Earlier normalization slips (e.g., V=4\u039b(\u03c0/3)) are now corrected; keep the identity 2 Cl_2(\u03c0/3)=3 Cl_2(2\u03c0/3) handy to reconcile Clausen forms.\\n- From max term to sum: With positivity, max_i C_{n,i} \u2264 f_n \u2264 (n+1) max_i C_{n,i}. Thus log f_n=(V/\u03c0)n+O(log n) provided the single-term asymptotic has O(log n) error. This is the main remaining rigorous step.\\n\\nRigor gaps and concrete next steps\\n1) Uniform sum\u2013integral estimates: Prove a self-contained lemma using monotone Riemann-sum bounds (no EM needed) to get for \u03b8=\u03c0/(2n): for m with m\u03b8\u2264c<\u03c0, \u2211_{r=1}^m log(2 sin(r\u03b8)) = \u03b8^{-1}\u222b_0^{m\u03b8} log(2 sin t)dt + O(log n) (the O(log n) comes from the t\u22480 endpoint), and similarly for \u2211 log(2 cos(k\u03b8)) with O(1) error when the upper limit \u2264 \u03c0/2\u2212\u03b4. This suffices for i in a fixed window around n/3.\\n2) Unimodality or localization: Either (a) prove unimodality via the exact ratio R_n(i)=cos(i\u03b8)cos((i+1)\u03b8)/[sin((2i+1)\u03b8)sin((2i+2)\u03b8)] and show the unique crossing near i\u2248n/3, or (b) bound the complement |i\u2212n/3|\u2265n^{2/3} by a fixed exponential gap using a quadratic lower bound on F around \u03c0/6. This yields the O(log n) correction when summing.\\n3) Document the v_3/\u039b/Cl_2 identities with a citation (Lewin; Milnor; Neumann\u2013Zagier) and state the exact normalization \u039b(x)=\u2212\u222b_0^x log(2 sin t)dt so readers can audit constants.\\n4) Endpoint i=n: Record the cancellation giving C_{n,n}=1 to avoid confusion about 0/0 at [2n]_v.\\n\\nPer-prover guidance\\n- P1: Your revised normalization is now consistent: \u03a6(1/3)=v_3/\u03c0, hence exponent V/\u03c0. Please replace Lemma A\u2019s sketch with a rigorous monotone sum\u2013integral inequality and add a concise proof or citation for v_3=3\u039b(\u03c0/3).\\n- P2: The uniform lemma is good; emphasize the monotone bounds (no need for full EM). Tighten the conditions (ranges ensuring monotonicity of log sin/log cos). Keep the ratio R_n(i) argument to justify localization.\\n- P3: Your narrative is clearest. Please supply the precise inequalities turning log C_{n,\u230an/3\u230b} into (V/\u03c0)n+O(log n) and add the Clausen identity reference.\\n\\nConclusion: Correct main rate is V/\u03c0; the original V/(2\u03c0) claim appears false.
