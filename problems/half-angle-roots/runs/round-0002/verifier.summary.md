All provers reduce to a sine-product and a Laplace principle with a single rate function. The unique maximizer is at i≈n/3. Evaluating the rate gives F(π/6)=3Λ(π/3)=v_3, so max log term is (2/π)v_3 n=(V/π)n. Positivity then implies log f_n(e^{π i/n})=(V/π)n+O(log n), contradicting the original V/(2π) claim. Remaining work: rigorous sum–integral O(log n) bounds, a clean localization/unimodality argument, and explicit Clausen/Lobachevsky identities. The endpoint i=n cancels to C_{n,n}=1.
