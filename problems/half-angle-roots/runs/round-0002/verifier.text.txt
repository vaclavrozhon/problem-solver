{"feedback_md":"Overall: All three provers correctly reduce the problem at q=e^{π i/n} (v=e^{π i/(2n)}) to products of sines/cosines and a one-dimensional Laplace principle. They agree on a unique maximizer at i≈n/3. The remaining friction is normalization against the figure‑eight volume and rigor of the sum–integral estimates. The consensus now is that the original claim is off by a factor 2; the correct exponential rate is V/π.\n\nTechnical audit\n- Sine-product reduction: Sound. For θ=π/(2n), [m]_v=sin(mθ)/sinθ and C_{n,i}=[n+i choose 2i]_v equals ∏_{k=n−i+1}^{n+i} sin(kθ)/∏_{k=1}^{2i} sin(kθ). An equivalent cosine form holds: C_{n,i}=cos(iθ)∏_{k=1}^{i−1}cos^2(kθ)/∏_{k=1}^{2i}sin(kθ). For 0≤i≤n−1, C_{n,i}>0. At i=n, cancellations give C_{n,n}=1 (not 0). Please correct the minor misprint in Notes where an extra “sin(k−(n−i))?” appears.\n- Rate function: For i=αn, log C_{n,i}=(2n/π)F(x)+O(log n) with x=(π/2)α and F(x)=Λ(2x)+2Λ(π/2−x), Λ(y)=−∫_0^y log(2 sin t)dt. Derivative analysis gives a unique maximizer at α=1/3 (x=π/6). This is consistent across provers; the calculus and sign checks are correct.\n- Value at maximizer: F(π/6)=Λ(π/3)+2Λ(π/3)=3Λ(π/3). Using v_3=Vol(regular ideal tetrahedron)=Cl_2(π/3)=3Λ(π/3) and V(4_1)=2v_3, we obtain max_i log C_{n,i}=(2n/π)v_3=(V/π)n up to O(log n). Earlier normalization slips (e.g., V=4Λ(π/3)) are now corrected; keep the identity 2 Cl_2(π/3)=3 Cl_2(2π/3) handy to reconcile Clausen forms.\n- From max term to sum: With positivity, max_i C_{n,i} ≤ f_n ≤ (n+1) max_i C_{n,i}. Thus log f_n=(V/π)n+O(log n) provided the single-term asymptotic has O(log n) error. This is the main remaining rigorous step.\n\nRigor gaps and concrete next steps\n1) Uniform sum–integral estimates: Prove a self-contained lemma using monotone Riemann-sum bounds (no EM needed) to get for θ=π/(2n): for m with mθ≤c<π, ∑_{r=1}^m log(2 sin(rθ)) = θ^{-1}∫_0^{mθ} log(2 sin t)dt + O(log n) (the O(log n) comes from the t≈0 endpoint), and similarly for ∑ log(2 cos(kθ)) with O(1) error when the upper limit ≤ π/2−δ. This suffices for i in a fixed window around n/3.\n2) Unimodality or localization: Either (a) prove unimodality via the exact ratio R_n(i)=cos(iθ)cos((i+1)θ)/[sin((2i+1)θ)sin((2i+2)θ)] and show the unique crossing near i≈n/3, or (b) bound the complement |i−n/3|≥n^{2/3} by a fixed exponential gap using a quadratic lower bound on F around π/6. This yields the O(log n) correction when summing.\n3) Document the v_3/Λ/Cl_2 identities with a citation (Lewin; Milnor; Neumann–Zagier) and state the exact normalization Λ(x)=−∫_0^x log(2 sin t)dt so readers can audit constants.\n4) Endpoint i=n: Record the cancellation giving C_{n,n}=1 to avoid confusion about 0/0 at [2n]_v.\n\nPer-prover guidance\n- P1: Your revised normalization is now consistent: Φ(1/3)=v_3/π, hence exponent V/π. Please replace Lemma A’s sketch with a rigorous monotone sum–integral inequality and add a concise proof or citation for v_3=3Λ(π/3).\n- P2: The uniform lemma is good; emphasize the monotone bounds (no need for full EM). Tighten the conditions (ranges ensuring monotonicity of log sin/log cos). Keep the ratio R_n(i) argument to justify localization.\n- P3: Your narrative is clearest. Please supply the precise inequalities turning log C_{n,⌊n/3⌋} into (V/π)n+O(log n) and add the Clausen identity reference.\n\nConclusion: Correct main rate is V/π; the original V/(2π) claim appears false. A fully rigorous write-up is near with the sum–integral lemma and a short localization argument.","summary_md":"All provers reduce to a sine-product and a Laplace principle with a single rate function.
