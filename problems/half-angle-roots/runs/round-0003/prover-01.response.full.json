This yields a clean, rigorous derivation of the rate function for log C_{n,i} where C_{n,i}=qbinom(n+i,2i)_v.\\n- Identify the unique maximizer \u03b1\u22c6=1/3 by differentiating the rate function, and evaluate its value using standard Clausen/Lobachevsky identities to match v_3=Cl_2(\u03c0/3)=3\u039b(\u03c0/3) and V(4_1)=2v_3.\\n- Conclude log f_n equals the log of the maximal summand up to O(log n) because of positivity, establishing the exponential rate V/\u03c0 (not V/(2\u03c0)).\\n\\nKey lemma: uniform sum\u2013integral bound (rigorous)\\nLet f(u)=log(2 sin u) on (0,\u03c0), \u03b8\u2208(0,\u03c0/2), and S(m):=\u2211_{k=1}^m f(k\u03b8). Define\\nE(m):=S(m)\u2212\u03b8^{\u22121}\u222b_0^{m\u03b8} f(u) du.\\nThen, for all integers 1\u2264m\u2264\u230a\u03c0/\u03b8\u230b\u22121,\\n- |E(m)| \u2264 \u222b_0^{m\u03b8} |f\u2032(t)| dt = \u222b_0^{m\u03b8} |cot t| dt.\\n- In particular, for \u03b8=\u03c0/(2n), we have uniformly |E(m)|=O(log n).\\nProof. For k\u22651, set I_k=[(k\u22121)\u03b8,k\u03b8].

Writing \u03b1:=i/n and using (n\u00b1i)\u03b8=\u03c0/2\u00b1(\u03c0\u03b1/2), 2i\u03b8=\u03c0\u03b1,\\nlog C_{n,i} = (2n/\u03c0) \u03a6(\u03b1) + O(log n),\\nwith the rate function\\n\u03a6(\u03b1) = (1/\u03c0)[\u039b(\u03c0(1\u2212\u03b1)/2)+\u039b(\u03c0\u03b1)\u2212\u039b(\u03c0(1+\u03b1)/2)].\\nThis O(log n) error is uniform for 0\u2264i\u2264n\u22121 (and C_{n,n}=1).\\n\\nMaximizer and its value\\nDifferentiate using \u039b\u2032(x)=\u2212log(2 sin x):\\n\u03a6\u2032(\u03b1)= 1/2 log(2 \\\\sin(\u03c0(1\u2212\u03b1)/2)) \u2212 log(2 \\\\sin(\u03c0\u03b1)) \u2212 1/2 log(2 \\\\sin(\u03c0(1+\u03b1)/2)).\\nUsing sin((1\u00b1\u03b1)\u03c0/2)=cos(\u03c0\u03b1/2), this simplifies to\\n\u03a6\u2032(\u03b1)= log( cos(\u03c0\u03b1/2) / sin(\u03c0\u03b1) ).\\nHence \u03a6\u2032(\u03b1)=0 iff sin(\u03c0\u03b1/2)=1/2, giving the unique solution \u03b1\u22c6=1/3. Moreover \u03a6\u2033(\u03b1)<0 on (0,1/2), so \u03b1\u22c6 is the unique global maximizer.\\nAt \u03b1=1/3, set x:=\u03c0/6. Then\\n\u03a6(1/3) = (1/\u03c0)[\u039b(\u03c0/3)+\u039b(2\u03c0/3)\u2212\u039b(2\u03c0/3)] + (1/\u03c0)\u039b(\u03c0/3) = (1/\u03c0)\u00b73\u039b(\u03c0/3).\\nUsing \u039b(x)=(1/2)Cl_2(2x) and the classical identity 2 Cl_2(\u03c0/3)=3 Cl_2(2\u03c0/3) (see Lewin, Polylogarithms and Associated Functions), we get 3\u039b(\u03c0/3)=Cl_2(\u03c0/3)=:v_3, the volume of the regular ideal tetrahedron. The figure\u2011eight volume is V=2v_3. Therefore\\n\u03a6(1/3)=v_3/\u03c0=V/(2\u03c0).\\nConsequently, the maximal summand satisfies\\nmax_{0\u2264i\u2264n} log C_{n,i} = (2n/\u03c0)\u03a6(1/3)+O(log n) = (V/\u03c0)n+O(log n).\\n\\nFrom maximal summand to f_n\\nBy positivity, max_i C_{n,i} \u2264 f_n(e^{\u03c0 i/n}) \u2264 (n+1) max_i C_{n,i}. Taking logs,\\nlog f_n(e^{\u03c0 i/n}) = (V/\u03c0) n + O(log n).\\nThus the exponential growth rate is V/\u03c0, contradicting the original V/(2\u03c0) claim by a factor 2.\\n\\nExamples / numerical check\\n- Compute a_n:=(1/n) log f_n(e^{\u03c0 i/n}) for n=100,200,400. Expect a_n\u2192V/\u03c0\u22480.64626.\\n- For i_0=\u230an/3\u230b, log C_{n,i_0} should already be within O(1) of (V/\u03c0) n for moderate n.\\n\\nObstacles\\n- The identity 2 Cl_2(\u03c0/3)=3 Cl_2(2\u03c0/3) is standard but should be cited or proved (e.g., via Clausen functional equations or Bloch\u2013Wigner invariances). A short proof can be supplied on request.\\n- While unimodality is not needed for the O(log n) precision, one can verify it via the exact ratio R_n(i)=C_{n,i+1}/C_{n,i} and the sign of \u03a6\u2032 to localize the peak near i\u2248n/3.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Document a self-contained proof (or precise citation) of 2 Cl_2(\u03c0/3)=3 Cl_2(2\u03c0/3) and V=2v_3.\\n- Optional: refine to a Gaussian window and obtain the n^{1/2} prefactor using \u03a6\u2033(1/3)=\u2212(\u03c0\u221a3)/2 and second-order Euler\u2013Maclaurin terms.\\n- Provide explicit constants in the O(log n) bound of the lemma (e.g., |E(m)| \u2264 C_0 + C_1 log n) using sin x \u2265 (2/\u03c0) min{x,\u03c0\u2212x}.\"}",
