Ideas
- Make the sum–integral replacement for S(m):=∑_{k=1}^{m} log(2 sin(kθ)) with θ=π/(2n), with an explicit and uniform O(log n) error. This yields a clean, rigorous derivation of the rate function for log C_{n,i} where C_{n,i}=qbinom(n+i,2i)_v.
- Identify the unique maximizer α⋆=1/3 by differentiating the rate function, and evaluate its value using standard Clausen/Lobachevsky identities to match v_3=Cl_2(π/3)=3Λ(π/3) and V(4_1)=2v_3.
- Conclude log f_n equals the log of the maximal summand up to O(log n) because of positivity, establishing the exponential rate V/π (not V/(2π)).

Key lemma: uniform sum–integral bound (rigorous)
Let f(u)=log(2 sin u) on (0,π), θ∈(0,π/2), and S(m):=∑_{k=1}^m f(kθ). Define
E(m):=S(m)−θ^{−1}∫_0^{mθ} f(u) du.
Then, for all integers 1≤m≤⌊π/θ⌋−1,
- |E(m)| ≤ ∫_0^{mθ} |f′(t)| dt = ∫_0^{mθ} |cot t| dt.
- In particular, for θ=π/(2n), we have uniformly |E(m)|=O(log n).
Proof. For k≥1, set I_k=[(k−1)θ,kθ]. Then
f(kθ)−θ^{−1}∫_{I_k} f(u) du = θ^{−1}∫_{I_k} (f(kθ)−f(u)) du.
By the fundamental theorem of calculus and Fubini,
|f(kθ)−θ^{−1}∫_{I_k} f| ≤ θ^{−1}∫_{I_k}∫_{u}^{kθ} |f′(t)| dt du = ∫_{I_k} |f′(t)| dt.
Summing k=1,…,m gives |E(m)|≤∫_0^{mθ} |f′(t)| dt. For θ=π/(2n), the integral is O(log n) uniformly because ∫_0^{x} |cot t| dt ≲ 1+|log(\sin x)| and, for any m≤2n−1, both sin(mθ) and sin(π−mθ) are ≥c/n.

Application to C_{n,i}
Let θ=π/(2n), S(m) as above, and denote C_{n,i}:=qbinom(n+i,2i)_v. Then
log C_{n,i} = S(n+i) − S(n−i) − S(2i).
By the lemma,
log C_{n,i} = −θ^{−1}[Λ((n+i)θ) − Λ((n−i)θ) − Λ(2iθ)] + O(log n),
where Λ(x):=−∫_0^{x} log(2 \sin t) dt. Writing α:=i/n and using (n±i)θ=π/2±(πα/2), 2iθ=πα,
log C_{n,i} = (2n/π) Φ(α) + O(log n),
with the rate function
Φ(α) = (1/π)[Λ(π(1−α)/2)+Λ(πα)−Λ(π(1+α)/2)].
This O(log n) error is uniform for 0≤i≤n−1 (and C_{n,n}=1).

Maximizer and its value
Differentiate using Λ′(x)=−log(2 sin x):
Φ′(α)= 1/2 log(2 \sin(π(1−α)/2)) − log(2 \sin(πα)) − 1/2 log(2 \sin(π(1+α)/2)).
Using sin((1±α)π/2)=cos(πα/2), this simplifies to
Φ′(α)= log( cos(πα/2) / sin(πα) ).
Hence Φ′(α)=0 iff sin(πα/2)=1/2, giving the unique solution α⋆=1/3. Moreover Φ″(α)<0 on (0,1/2), so α⋆ is the unique global maximizer.
At α=1/3, set x:=π/6. Then
Φ(1/3) = (1/π)[Λ(π/3)+Λ(2π/3)−Λ(2π/3)] + (1/π)Λ(π/3) = (1/π)·3Λ(π/3).
Using Λ(x)=(1/2)Cl_2(2x) and the classical identity 2 Cl_2(π/3)=3 Cl_2(2π/3) (see Lewin, Polylogarithms and Associated Functions), we get 3Λ(π/3)=Cl_2(π/3)=:v_3, the volume of the regular ideal tetrahedron. The figure‑eight volume is V=2v_3. Therefore
Φ(1/3)=v_3/π=V/(2π).
Consequently, the maximal summand satisfies
max_{0≤i≤n} log C_{n,i} = (2n/π)Φ(1/3)+O(log n) = (V/π)n+O(log n).

From maximal summand to f_n
By positivity, max_i C_{n,i} ≤ f_n(e^{π i/n}) ≤ (n+1) max_i C_{n,i}. Taking logs,
log f_n(e^{π i/n}) = (V/π) n + O(log n).
Thus the exponential growth rate is V/π, contradicting the original V/(2π) claim by a factor 2.

Examples / numerical check
- Compute a_n:=(1/n) log f_n(e^{π i/n}) for n=100,200,400. Expect a_n→V/π≈0.64626.
- For i_0=⌊n/3⌋, log C_{n,i_0} should already be within O(1) of (V/π) n for moderate n.

Obstacles
- The identity 2 Cl_2(π/3)=3 Cl_2(2π/3) is standard but should be cited or proved (e.g., via Clausen functional equations or Bloch–Wigner invariances). A short proof can be supplied on request.
- While unimodality is not needed for the O(log n) precision, one can verify it via the exact ratio R_n(i)=C_{n,i+1}/C_{n,i} and the sign of Φ′ to localize the peak near i≈n/3.

Next steps
- Document a self-contained proof (or precise citation) of 2 Cl_2(π/3)=3 Cl_2(2π/3) and V=2v_3.
- Optional: refine to a Gaussian window and obtain the n^{1/2} prefactor using Φ″(1/3)=−(π√3)/2 and second-order Euler–Maclaurin terms.
- Provide explicit constants in the O(log n) bound of the lemma (e.g., |E(m)| ≤ C_0 + C_1 log n) using sin x ≥ (2/π) min{x,π−x}.
