Overview
We close the remaining rigor gaps: (i) prove a uniform, elementary sum–integral estimate for partial sums of log(2 sin) tailored to our decomposition of log C_{n,i}, avoiding the singularity at 0; (ii) derive a clean, O(1)-accurate single-summand asymptotic using only sine-sums; (iii) give a Gaussian-type localization to pass from the maximal term to f_n with O(log n) accuracy; (iv) record the normalization F(π/6)=v_3=3Λ(π/3) and V=2v_3.

Notation. θ:=π/(2n), v=e^{π i/(2n)}, x:=iθ∈[0,π/2]. Define Λ(y):=−∫_0^y log(2 sin t)dt and F(x):=Λ(2x)+2Λ(π/2−x).

Lemma 1 (Sine-product form, positivity, endpoint).
For 0≤i≤n,
C_{n,i}:=\qbinom{n+i}{2i}_v=\frac{\prod_{k=n-i+1}^{n+i}\sin(kθ)}{\prod_{k=1}^{2i}\sin(kθ)}.
For 0≤i≤n−1, all factors are positive and C_{n,i}>0. Moreover, as a rational function of v, C_{n,n}=\qbinom{2n}{2n}_v=1, hence its specialized value at v=e^{π i/(2n)} equals 1.
Proof. The identity is immediate from [m]_v=sin(mθ)/sin θ, after canceling the sin θ factors. For 0≤i≤n−1, the denominator never hits a sine zero, and in the numerator the range [n−i+1,n+i] sits in (0,2n), avoiding 2n, hence all factors are positive. The endpoint i=n gives identical numerator and denominator products (both include k=2n), yielding a 0/0 in the product expression; by the definition of the q-binomial as a rational function, \qbinom{2n}{2n}_v=1.

A tailored sum–integral bound
For f(t):=\log(2\sin t), define partial block sums
H_{a,b}:=\sum_{k=a+1}^{b} f(kθ)\quad (\text{integers }0\le a<b\le\lfloor \pi/θ\rfloor).

Lemma 2 (Riemann-sum control on blocks away from 0,π).
Fix 0<ε<\pi/2. There exists C_ε such that whenever aθ,bθ∈[ε,\pi−ε],
|\,θ H_{a,b}−\int_{aθ}^{bθ} f(t)dt\,|\le C_ε\,θ.
Proof. On [ε,\pi−ε], f is C^2 with bounded f',f''. By a one-step Euler–Maclaurin formula (or trapezoid rule error bound), the remainder is O(θ) with a constant depending only on sup_{[ε,\pi−ε]}|f'|,|f''|.

Lemma 3 (Initial-cell control for blocks starting at 0).
There is an absolute C such that for all m≥1,
\Big|\,θ\sum_{k=1}^{m} f(kθ)−\int_0^{mθ} f(t)dt\,\Big|\le C\,\theta\,\big(1+|\log\theta|\big)+C\,\theta\,f(mθ).
In particular, if mθ∈[ε,\pi−ε], the right-hand side is O_ε(θ(1+|\log\theta|)).
Proof. For increasing f on (0,\pi/2), the monotone Riemann sum bounds give ∫_{θ}^{(m+1)θ} f ≤ θ∑_{k=1}^m f(kθ) ≤ ∫_0^{mθ} f. Hence the difference is bounded by ∫_0^{θ} f + ∫_{mθ}^{(m+1)θ} f. The first term is θ\sup_{[0,θ]} f(t)=O(θ\log\theta) (using f(t)=\log t+O(1) as t→0), and the second is θ f(mθ).

Single-summand asymptotics via sine-sums only
Define G(m):=\sum_{k=1}^{m} \log(2\sin(kθ)). Using Lemma 1,
\log C_{n,i}=\Big(\sum_{k=n-i+1}^{n+i}\!\log\sin(kθ)\Big)\,−\,\sum_{k=1}^{2i}\!\log\sin(kθ) 
=\Big(H_{n-i,n+i}\big|_{f=\log\sin}\Big)\,−\,\Big(H_{0,2i}\big|_{f=\log\sin}\Big).
It is convenient to inject the factor 2 into the logs; since the 2’s cancel between the two terms, we equivalently write
\log C_{n,i}=\underbrace{\sum_{k=n-i+1}^{n+i}\!\log(2\sin(kθ))}_{\mathcal{A}_{n,i}}\,−\,\underbrace{\sum_{k=1}^{2i}\!\log(2\sin(kθ))}_{\mathcal{B}_{n,i}}.
Set x:=iθ. Then (n\pm i)θ=\tfrac{\pi}{2}\pm x and 2iθ=2x.

Proposition 4 (Uniform O(1) single-summand asymptotic near the peak).
Fix δ∈(0,\tfrac{1}{2}). There exists C_δ such that for all i with i/n∈[δ,1−δ],
\log C_{n,i}=\frac{1}{\theta}\Big(\int_{\frac{\pi}{2}−x}^{\frac{\pi}{2}+x}\!\log(2\sin t)\,dt\;−\;\int_0^{2x}\!\log(2\sin t)\,dt\Big)+O_{δ}(1).
Equivalently,
\log C_{n,i}=\frac{2n}{\pi}\,\Big(2\int_0^{x}\!\log(2\cos u)\,du\;−\;\int_0^{2x}\!\log(2\sin t)\,dt\Big)+O_{δ}(1)=\frac{2n}{\pi}F(x)+O_{δ}(1).
Proof. Split \mathcal{A}_{n,i} as a block sum H_{n-i,n+i} with f(t)=\log(2\sin t) on [\tfrac{\pi}{2}−x,\tfrac{\pi}{2}+x]. Since x∈[δ\tfrac{\pi}{2},(1−δ)\tfrac{\pi}{2}], the interval lies in [ε,\pi−ε] for some ε(δ)>0. Apply Lemma 2 and divide by θ. For \mathcal{B}_{n,i}, apply Lemma 3 with m=2i; since 2x∈[2εδ,\pi−2εδ], the error is O_δ(1) after dividing by θ. The middle identity is by the change of variables t=\tfrac{\pi}{2}±u.

Rate function calculus and its value
Proposition 5.
(i) F'(x)=2(\log(2\cos x)−\log(2\sin 2x)). Hence F has a unique maximizer at x_*=\pi/6.
(ii) F''(x)=2(−\tan x−2\cot 2x), so F''(\pi/6)=−2\sqrt{3}<0.
(iii) F(\pi/6)=Λ(\pi/3)+2Λ(\pi/3)=3Λ(\pi/3)=:v_3.
Proof. (i)–(ii) are routine derivatives. (iii) By definition of Λ and the change of variables used above. The identity v_3=3Λ(\pi/3) is the classical volume formula for an ideal tetrahedron with dihedral angles (\pi/3,\pi/3,\pi/3). Standard references: Milnor, “Hyperbolic geometry: the first 150 years”, or Thurston’s notes; equivalently, with Clausen Cl_2, Λ(θ)=\tfrac{1}{2}Cl_2(2θ) and 2 Cl_2(\pi/3)=3 Cl_2(2\pi/3) yield v_3=Cl_2(\pi/3)=3Λ(\pi/3).

Maximal summand asymptotics
Corollary 6.
max_{0≤i≤n}\log C_{n,i}=\frac{2n}{\pi}v_3+O(\log n)=\frac{V}{\pi}n+O(\log n), where V=2v_3 is the figure‑eight volume.
Proof. Lower bound: choose i_0 with |i_0θ−\pi/6|≤θ. By Proposition 4 and a second-order Taylor bound around x_*, F(x)=F(x_*)+\tfrac{1}{2}F''(\xi)(x−x_*)^2 with F'' bounded on a small neighborhood, so \log C_{n,i_0}=\frac{2n}{\pi}F(\pi/6)+O(1). Upper bound: For any fixed η∈(0,\tfrac{1}{2}), by continuity and uniqueness of the maximizer there is c(η)>0 with F(x)≤F(x_*)−c(η) whenever |x−x_*|≥η. For i with |i/n−1/3|≥η, Proposition 4 gives \log C_{n,i}≤\frac{2n}{\pi}(F(x_*)−c(η))+O(1). For |i/n−1/3|<η, Taylor’s theorem and F''(\pi/6)<0 yield \log C_{n,i}≤\frac{2n}{\pi}\Big(F(x_*)−\kappa (i−i_*)^2\theta^2\Big)+O(1) for some \kappa>0. Maximizing over i and summing a Gaussian tail shows max_i \log C_{n,i}=\frac{2n}{\pi}F(x_*)+O(\log n).

From the maximal summand to the full sum
Proposition 7.
\log f_n(e^{\pi i/n})=\max_{i}\log C_{n,i}+O(\log n)=\frac{V}{\pi}n+O(\log n).
Proof. By Lemma 1, C_{n,i}≥0 for all i and C_{n,n}=1>0. Thus max_i C_{n,i}≤f_n≤(n+1)\,\max_i C_{n,i}, giving \log f_n=\max_i\log C_{n,i}+O(\log n). Combine with Corollary 6.

Unimodality via the discrete ratio (sanity check)
Define R_n(i):=C_{n,i+1}/C_{n,i}. A direct calculation with [m]_v=\sin(mθ)/\sin θ gives
R_n(i)=\frac{\sin((n−i)θ)\,\sin((n+i+1)θ)}{\sin((2i+1)θ)\,\sin((2i+2)θ)}=\frac{\cos(iθ)\,\cos((i+1)θ)}{\sin((2i+1)θ)\,\sin((2i+2)θ)}.
With x=iθ, θ→0, R_n(i)→\frac{\cos^2 x}{\sin^2(2x)}. Hence R_n(i)>1 for x<\pi/6 and <1 for x>\pi/6, confirming unimodality and the peak near i≈n/3. A quantitative version (using continuity in (x,θ)) yields a unique crossing index for n large.

Conclusion
- The single-summand rate is governed by F(x)=Λ(2x)+2Λ(\tfrac{\pi}{2}−x), with a unique maximizer at x=\pi/6 and value F(\pi/6)=v_3=3Λ(\pi/3).
- Therefore max_i\log C_{n,i}=(2n/\pi)v_3+O(\log n)=(V/\pi)n+O(\log n). Since all summands are nonnegative, \log f_n(e^{\pi i/n})=\max_i\log C_{n,i}+O(\log n).
- The correct exponential rate is f_n(e^{\pi i/n})=\exp((V/\pi)n+o(n)). This contradicts the original V/(2\pi) claim by a factor 2.

Next steps
- Write out the short Euler–Maclaurin proof of Lemma 2 with explicit constants and a clean version of Lemma 3 (or bypass it by always applying block estimates on [ε,\pi−ε] using the identity with H_{a,b}).
- Provide a Gaussian local limit (second-order Laplace method) to extract the pre-exponential factor of order n^{−1/2} for f_n.
- Record references for v_3=Cl_2(\pi/3)=3Λ(\pi/3) (e.g., Lewin’s Polylogarithms, Milnor, Zagier).
