The notes correctly develop an asymptotic with rate V/\\\\pi, not V/(2\\\\pi). The current output lacks a proof. Below I identify gaps and propose precise lemmas and steps to make the argument rigorous.\\n\\nCore ideas retained\\n- At v=e^{\\\\pi i/(2n)} (\u03b8=\\\\pi/(2n)) one has [m]_v = \\\\sin(m\u03b8)/\\\\sin \u03b8.\\n- The summand can be written exactly as\\n  C_{n,i}:=\\\\qbinom{n+i}{2i}_v = \\\\frac{\\\\prod_{k=n-i+1}^{n+i} \\\\sin(k\u03b8)}{\\\\prod_{k=1}^{2i} \\\\sin(k\u03b8)}.\\n  An equivalent cosine form for 0\u2264i\u2264n\u22121 is C_{n,i} = \\\\cos(i\u03b8)\\\\prod_{k=1}^{i-1}\\\\cos^2(k\u03b8)/\\\\prod_{k=1}^{2i}\\\\sin(k\u03b8) (use sin((n\u00b1p)\u03b8)=cos(p\u03b8)). Note: C_{n,n}=1 (exact cancellation of zeros in the sine product); the cosine form has a 0/0 and should not be used at i=n.\\n- For i\u2248\u03b1n, log C_{n,i} = (2n/\\\\pi) F(x) + O(\\\\log n) with x=(\\\\pi/2)\u03b1 and F(x)=\u039b(2x)+2\u039b(\\\\tfrac{\\\\pi}{2}\u2212x), where \u039b(y)=\u2212\\\\int_0^y \\\\log(2\\\\sin t) dt is the Lobachevsky function.\\n- F has a unique maximizer at x\u22c6=\\\\pi/6 (\u03b1\u22c6=1/3), with F(\\\\pi/6)=3\u039b(\\\\pi/3)=Cl_2(\\\\pi/3)=:v_3, the regular ideal tetrahedron volume; V(4_1)=2v_3.

Let \u03b8=\\\\pi/(2n). For 1\u2264M\u22642n\u22121,\\n  \u2211_{k=1}^M \\\\log(2\\\\sin(k\u03b8)) = \u03b8^{\u22121}\\\\int_0^{M\u03b8} \\\\log(2\\\\sin t) dt + O(\\\\log n),\\n  uniformly in M. Sketch: Split at K=\\\\lfloor n^{2/3}\\\\rfloor. For k\u2264K, \\\\log(2\\\\sin(k\u03b8))=\\\\log(2k\u03b8)+O((k\u03b8)^2), sum gives \\\\log(K!) + K\\\\log(2\u03b8) + O(1)=\u03b8^{\u22121}\\\\int_0^{K\u03b8}\\\\log(2\\\\sin t)dt + O(\\\\log n). For k>K, f(t)=\\\\log(2\\\\sin t) is C^1 and bounded away from its endpoint singularities on [K\u03b8, M\u03b8] (or has integrable behavior near M\u03b8\u2264\\\\pi), so Euler\u2013Maclaurin or monotone sum\u2013integral bounds give O(1) error; the overall error is O(\\\\log n). This handles both t\u22480 and t\u2248\\\\pi.\\n- Lemma B (Uniform sum\u2013integral for log(2 cos)). For 1\u2264M\u2264n, with \u03b8=\\\\pi/(2n),\\n  \u2211_{k=1}^M \\\\log(2\\\\cos(k\u03b8)) = \u03b8^{\u22121}\\\\int_0^{M\u03b8} \\\\log(2\\\\cos t) dt + O(\\\\log n),\\n  uniformly in M. Sketch: Same splitting; near t\u2248\\\\pi/2, \\\\log(2\\\\cos t) behaves like \\\\log(\\\\pi/2\u2212t), producing at most an O(\\\\log n) contribution; away from the singularity, EM yields O(1).\\n- Lemma C (Variational formula). For i=\\\\lfloor xn\\\\rfloor, x\u2208[0,1],\\n  log C_{n,i} = \\\\frac{2n}{\\\\pi}\\\\Big(2\\\\int_0^{\\\\frac{\\\\pi x}{2}} \\\\log\\\\cos t\\\\,dt \u2212 \\\\int_0^{\\\\pi x} \\\\log\\\\sin t\\\\,dt\\\\Big) + O(\\\\log n),\\n  uniformly in x. Proof: Rewrite the numerator as cos sums using sin((n\u00b1p)\u03b8)=cos(p\u03b8), keep the denominator as a sin sum, and apply Lemmas A\u2013B.\\n- Lemma D (Maximizer and concavity). Define G(x)=2\u222b_0^{\\\\frac{\\\\pi x}{2}} \\\\log\\\\cos t\\\\,dt \u2212 \u222b_0^{\\\\pi x} \\\\log\\\\sin t\\\\,dt. Then G\u2032(x)=\\\\pi\\\\log(\\\\cos(\\\\tfrac{\\\\pi x}{2})/\\\\sin(\\\\pi x)); G\u2033(x)=\u2212\\\\tfrac{\\\\pi^2}{2}\\\\tan(\\\\tfrac{\\\\pi x}{2})\u2212\\\\pi^2\\\\cot(\\\\pi x)<0 on (0,1). Thus a unique maximizer at x\u22c6=1/3. Moreover, G(x) \u2264 G(1/3) \u2212 c(x\u22121/3)^2 on [0,1] for some c>0.\\n- Lemma E (Value at maximizer). G(1/3)=3\u039b(\\\\pi/3)=Cl_2(\\\\pi/3)=:v_3. Proof: Use F(x)=\u039b(2x)+2\u039b(\\\\tfrac{\\\\pi}{2}\u2212x), F(\\\\pi/6)=\u039b(\\\\pi/3)+2\u039b(\\\\pi/3)=3\u039b(\\\\pi/3), and \u039b(y)=\\\\tfrac12 Cl_2(2y). Cite Lewin (Polylogarithms) for 2 Cl_2(\\\\pi/3)=3 Cl_2(2\\\\pi/3) and v_3=Cl_2(\\\\pi/3). V(4_1)=2v_3.\\n- Proposition (Max term and sum). There exists C>0 such that for all i, log C_{n,i} \u2264 (V/\\\\pi)n + C\\\\log n, with equality up to O(\\\\log n) for i=\\\\lfloor n/3\\\\rfloor. Consequently, (V/\\\\pi)n \u2212 C\\\\log n \u2264 \\\\log f_n(e^{\\\\pi i/n}) \u2264 (V/\\\\pi)n + (C+1)\\\\log n.\\n\\nToy checks and edge cases\\n- Positivity: For 0\u2264i\u2264n\u22121, all sin(k\u03b8)>0 with k\u22642n\u22121; hence C_{n,i}>0. For i=n, the sine-product cancellation yields C_{n,n}=1.\\n- Ratio/unimodality (optional): R_n(i)=C_{n,i+1}/C_{n,i} = [\\\\cos(i\u03b8)\\\\,\\\\cos((i+1)\u03b8)]/[\\\\sin((2i+1)\u03b8)\\\\,\\\\sin((2i+2)\u03b8)]. For i/n<1/3\u2212\\\\delta, R_n(i)>1; for i/n>1/3+\\\\delta, R_n(i)<1 (for n large), giving a unique peak near n/3 and supporting Gaussian-window localization if needed.\\n\\nSpecific recommendations for the writeup\\n- Correct the main statement to f_n(e^{\\\\pi i/n}) = exp((V/\\\\pi) n + O(\\\\log n)).\\n- Replace the numerator/denominator line with the clean sine product and explicitly treat i=n (C_{n,n}=1).\\n- Insert Lemmas A\u2013E with proofs or references. Emphasize uniformity of O(\\\\log n) errors.\\n- Add a brief, cited derivation of 3\u039b(\\\\pi/3)=Cl_2(\\\\pi/3) and V=2v_3.\\n- Optionally, include the ratio argument to demonstrate unimodality and to pave the way for second-order asymptotics.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Formalize Lemmas A\u2013C with full details (monotone sum\u2013integral or Euler\u2013Maclaurin with explicit bounds).\\n- Write the short proof of Lemmas D\u2013E and assemble the Proposition.\\n- Provide a brief numerical check for moderate n to corroborate that (1/n)\\\\log f_n(e^{\\\\pi i/n})\u2192V/\\\\pi\u22480.6464.\\n\\nConclusion\\n- The current claim is off by a factor of 2. With the above lemmas and minor corrections, the main result f_n(e^{\\\\pi i/n})=exp((V/\\\\pi)n+O(\\\\log n)) can be presented cleanly and rigorously.\"}",
