# Problem — Asymptotics at half-angle roots and the figure-eight volume

For $n\in\mathbb{N}$, define the **symmetrized $q$-binomial** using a parameter $v$ by

$$
[m]_v \;=\; \frac{v^{m}-v^{-m}}{v-v^{-1}},\qquad
\qbinom{a}{b}_v \;=\; \frac{[a]_v [a-1]_v \cdots [a-b+1]_v}{[b]_v [b-1]_v \cdots [1]_v},
$$

with the convention that $\qbinom{a}{0}_v=1$ and $\qbinom{a}{b}_v=0$ if $b<0$ or $b>a$.
Set $q=v^2$. For each $n$, define

$$
f_n(q)\;=\;\sum_{i=0}^{n}\qbinom{n+i}{2i}_v .
$$

Let $V$ denote the hyperbolic volume of the figure-eight knot $4_1$ $(V\approx 2.0298832128)$.

**Claim.** With the specialization $q=e^{\pi i/n}$ (equivalently $v=e^{\pi i/(2n)}$), the sequence satisfies the asymptotic

$$
f_n\!\big(e^{\pi i/n}\big)\;=\;\exp\!\Big(\frac{V}{2\pi}\,n + o(n)\Big)\qquad\text{as }n\to\infty.
$$

In words: $f_n(e^{\pi i/n})$ grows like $\exp\!\big(\tfrac{V}{2\pi}n\big)$ as $n\to\infty$.

# Research Notes



Set-up at q=exp(π i/n)
- Let v=e^{π i/(2n)} and θ=π/(2n). Then [m]_v=(v^m−v^{-m})/(v−v^{-1})=sin(mθ)/sin θ.
- For 0≤i≤n, the summand is
  C_{n,i}:=\qbinom{n+i}{2i}_v=∏_{k=n-i+1}^{n+i}\frac{\sin(kθ)}{\sin(k−(n−i))?}\Big/∏_{k=1}^{2i}\sin(kθ)=∏_{k=n-i+1}^{n+i} \sin(kθ) / ∏_{k=1}^{2i} \sin(kθ).
  Equivalent cosine form: C_{n,i}=\cos(iθ)∏_{k=1}^{i-1}\cos^2(kθ) / ∏_{k=1}^{2i}\sin(kθ). For 0≤i≤n−1 all factors are positive. As a rational function in v, C_{n,n}=\qbinom{2n}{2n}_v=1.

Variational form
- For i≈αn (α∈[0,1]) one has
  log C_{n,i}=(2n/π)Φ(α)+O(\log n),
  with
  Φ(α)=(1/π)[Λ(π(1−α)/2)+Λ(πα)−Λ(π(1+α)/2)],
  and Λ(x)=−∫_0^x \log(2\sin t) dt. Equivalently, with x=(π/2)α,
  F(x):=Λ(2x)+2Λ(π/2−x), so log C_{n,i}=(2n/π)F(x)+O(\log n).
- Differentiation gives Φ′(α)=\log(\cos(πα/2)/\sin(πα)), hence a unique maximizer at α⋆=1/3 (x⋆=π/6). Strict concavity near α⋆ follows from Φ″(α)<0.

Value at the maximizer and the figure-eight volume
- At x=π/6, F(π/6)=Λ(π/3)+2Λ(π/3)=3Λ(π/3).
- Classical identities give 3Λ(π/3)=Cl_2(π/3)=:v_3 (volume of the regular ideal tetrahedron); the figure‑eight knot has volume V=2v_3. Thus
  max_i log C_{n,i}=(2n/π)·v_3+O(\log n)=(V/π) n+O(\log n).

Consequence for f_n
- Positivity (for i≤n−1) and unimodality (use the ratio R_n(i)=C_{n,i+1}/C_{n,i} and its continuum limit) imply the sum is exponentially governed by its maximal term:
  log f_n(e^{π i/n})=\max_i \log C_{n,i}+o(n)=(V/π) n+o(n).
- Therefore, the original claim with coefficient V/(2π) is off by a factor 2; the correct exponential growth rate is V/π.

To make fully rigorous
- Provide a uniform Euler–Maclaurin (or monotone sum–integral) estimate for S_s(m)=∑_{r=1}^m \log(2\sin(rθ)) and S_c(m)=∑_{k=1}^m \log(2\cos(kθ)) with O(\log n) remainders uniform in i/n on compact subsets of (0,1), along with endpoint handling.
- Prove 3Λ(π/3)=Cl_2(π/3) (e.g., via Clausen identities or a standard reference).
- Carry out a discrete Laplace method using the quadratic behavior of Φ near α⋆ to bound contributions away from i≈n/3.

Numerical check (suggested): (1/n)·log f_n(e^{π i/n}) should approach V/π≈0.64612.

Corrections and clarifications at q=e^{π i/n}
- Sine-product identity: For θ=π/(2n) and 0≤i≤n,
  C_{n,i}:=\qbinom{n+i}{2i}_v = \frac{\prod_{k=n-i+1}^{n+i}\sin(kθ)}{\prod_{k=1}^{2i}\sin(kθ)}.
  (The earlier fragment with “sin(k−(n−i))?” was a typo.) An equivalent form for 0≤i≤n−1 is
  C_{n,i}=\frac{\cos(iθ)\prod_{k=1}^{i−1}\cos^2(kθ)}{\prod_{k=1}^{2i}\sin(kθ)}.
  Then C_{n,i}>0 for 0≤i≤n−1, and cancellations give C_{n,n}=1.

- Rate function: For i≈αn, with x=(π/2)α,
  log C_{n,i}=(2n/π)F(x)+O(\log n), where F(x)=Λ(2x)+2Λ(\tfrac{π}{2}−x) and Λ(y)=−∫_0^y \log(2\sin t)dt. The unique maximizer is at α=1/3 (x=π/6).

- Value at the maximizer: F(π/6)=Λ(π/3)+2Λ(π/3)=3Λ(π/3)=:v_3, the regular ideal tetrahedron volume. Since V(4_1)=2v_3, we get
  max_i log C_{n,i}=(2n/π)v_3=(V/π)n up to O(\log n). Hence the correct exponential rate of f_n(e^{π i/n}) is V/π, not V/(2π).

- Monotone sum–integral bounds (to be formalized): For θ=π/(2n) and m with mθ≤c<π,
  ∑_{r=1}^m \log(2\sin(rθ)) = θ^{−1}∫_0^{mθ}\log(2\sin t)dt + O(\log n),
  ∑_{k=1}^m \log(2\cos(kθ)) = θ^{−1}∫_0^{mθ}\log(2\cos t)dt + O(1),
  with errors uniform when the upper limits stay ≤ π/2−δ for the cosine sum. This yields the O(\log n) accuracy around i≈n/3.

To-do
- Write the above bounds rigorously via monotone Riemann-sum inequalities, and add a short localization/unimodality argument (e.g., via the exact ratio R_n(i)).
- Record the identities v_3=Cl_2(π/3)=3Λ(π/3), V=2v_3, with references.
- Optional: refine to second-order (Gaussian window) to extract prefactors.

Normalization and final rate (clean version)
- Set θ=π/(2n), v=e^{π i/(2n)}. For 0≤i≤n,
  C_{n,i}:=\qbinom{n+i}{2i}_v=\frac{\prod_{k=n-i+1}^{n+i}\sin(kθ)}{\prod_{k=1}^{2i}\sin(kθ)}; for 0≤i≤n−1, C_{n,i}>0. At i=n the zeros cancel and C_{n,n}=1.
- For i=⌊αn⌋, with x=(π/2)α, define the Lobachevsky function Λ(y)=−∫_0^y log(2\sin t) dt and
  F(x)=Λ(2x)+2Λ(\tfrac{π}{2}−x).
  Then uniformly (with endpoint care),
  log C_{n,i}=(2n/π)F(x)+O(log n).
- Calculus: F′(x)=2(\log(2\cos x)−\log(2\sin 2x)), so the unique maximizer is x=π/6 (α=1/3), and F''(π/6)=−2\sqrt{3}<0.
- Value at the maximizer: F(π/6)=Λ(π/3)+2Λ(π/3)=3Λ(π/3)=Cl_2(π/3)=:v_3 (volume of the regular ideal tetrahedron). The figure‑eight knot volume is V=2v_3. Hence
  max_i \log C_{n,i}=(2n/π)v_3=(V/π) n + O(log n).
- Since all summands are nonnegative, max_i C_{n,i}≤f_n≤(n+1)max_i C_{n,i}, so
  \log f_n(e^{π i/n})=(V/π) n + O(log n).
  Thus the original V/(2π) claim is off by a factor 2.

To finalize rigor
- Prove uniform sum–integral bounds: for θ=π/(2n), uniformly in M,
  ∑_{k=1}^{M} \log(2\sin(kθ))=θ^{−1}∫_0^{Mθ} \log(2\sin t) dt + O(log n), and analogous bounds for ∑ \log(2\cos(kθ)) with care near π/2. Monotone Riemann-sum bounds and sin t ≥ (2/π)min{t,π−t} suffice.
- Optionally show unimodality via R_n(i)=C_{n,i+1}/C_{n,i} to localize mass near i≈n/3 and enable a Gaussian-window refinement for prefactors.
- Record references: Λ(y)=\tfrac12 Cl_2(2y); v_3=Cl_2(π/3)=3Λ(π/3); V=2v_3.

=== Verifier Summary ===

All provers correctly obtain a sine-product form and a Laplace-type rate with a unique maximizer at i≈n/3. The maximal rate evaluates to F(π/6)=3Λ(π/3)=v3, yielding max log term (2/π)v3·n=(V/π)n. Positivity then gives log f_n(e^{π i/n})=(V/π)n+O(log n). The original claim’s exponent V/(2π) is off by a factor 2. To finalize: provide uniform O(log n) sum–integral bounds, a brief Clausen/Lobachevsky identity reference, and a clean localization (ratio test).
