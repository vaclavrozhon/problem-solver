{"summary_md":"At q=e^{π i/n} (θ=π/(2n)) the summand C_{n,i}=\binom{n+i}{2i}_v reduces to a sine-product and one gets the variational formula log C_{n,i}=(2n/π)Φ(α)+O(log n) for i≈αn, with Φ expressed via the Lobachevsky function Λ. Φ has a unique maximizer at α⋆=1/3 (x⋆=π/6). Evaluating there yields F(π/6)=3Λ(π/3)=Cl_2(π/3)=:v_3, and since the figure‑eight volume V=2v_3 we obtain max_i log C_{n,i}=(V/π)n+O(log n). Positivity and unimodality imply the sum is dominated by the maximal term, so log f_n(e^{π i/n})=(V/π)n+o(n). Thus the original claimed exponent V/(2π) is off by factor 2. Remaining rigorous tasks are uniform sum–integral error control and a discrete Laplace localization.
