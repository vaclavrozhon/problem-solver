          "text": "{\"feedback_md\":\"Status: The reduction to a sine-product and a one-dimensional Laplace principle is correct and consistent across provers. The unique maximizer is at i\u2248n/3. The correct exponential rate is V/\u03c0, not V/(2\u03c0). The main remaining gaps are (i) uniform and fully rigorous sum\u2013integral bounds with explicit O(log n) errors, (ii) a clean evaluation of the maximized rate via standard Clausen/Lobachevsky identities, and (iii) tidying minor inconsistencies (definitions, endpoint i=n, and an overly strong O(1) claim).\\n\\nAudit by prover:\\n- Prover 1: The sum\u2013integral lemma using |cot| is sound and yields uniform O(log n) error. There is a notational inconsistency: you defined \u03a6(\u03b1) with an extra 1/\u03c0 and then wrote log C_{n,i}=(2n/\u03c0)\u03a6(\u03b1). This double 1/\u03c0 can confuse constants; please fix by working with F(x)=\u039b(2x)+2\u039b(\u03c0/2\u2212x) and log C_{n,i}=(2n/\u03c0)F(x)+O(log n). Your evaluation at \u03b1=1/3 is correct: F(\u03c0/6)=3\u039b(\u03c0/3)=Cl2(\u03c0/3)=v3, hence max log term =(2n/\u03c0)v3=(V/\u03c0)n. Cite the identity 2 Cl2(\u03c0/3)=3 Cl2(2\u03c0/3) or directly v3=Cl2(\u03c0/3).\\n- Prover 2: The block-sum approach is good. However, Proposition 4\u2019s error O\u03b4(1) after dividing by \u03b8 for the lower block starting at 0 is not correct as stated: Lemma 3 gives a \u03b8(1+|log \u03b8|) term, which becomes O(log n) upon dividing by \u03b8. Unless you implement a cancellation scheme (e.g., subtract small-k asymptotics exactly), the natural uniform error remains O(log n). This does not harm the main result. The localization (Gaussian window) argument is fine for an O(log n) aggregate error.\\n- Prover 3: Clear and correct high-level path. Please add explicit statements/proofs (or references) for (a) the uniform O(log n) sum\u2013integral inequalities and (b) the identity 3\u039b(\u03c0/3)=Cl2(\u03c0/3)=v3 and V=2v3.\\n\\nKey corrections/clarifications:\\n- Endpoint i=n: C_{n,n}=1 as a rational function; the sine product has a removable 0/0. Avoid the cosine form at i=n.\\n- Positivity: For 0\u2264i\u2264n\u22121, all factors lie in (0,\u03c0), hence C_{n,i}>0. Then max C_{n,i}\u2264f_n\u2264(n+1)max C_{n,i} and log f_n= max log C_{n,i}+O(log n).\\n- Normalization: Use F(x)=\u039b(2x)+2\u039b(\u03c0/2\u2212x). Then F\u2032(x)=2(log(2cos x)\u2212log(2sin 2x)), unique maximizer at x=\u03c0/6, and F(\u03c0/6)=v3.\\n\\nConcrete next steps:\\n1) Write a self-contained lemma: for \u03b8=\u03c0/(2n) and 1\u2264M\u22642n\u22121, \u2211_{k=1}^M log(2 sin(k\u03b8)) = \u03b8^{-1}\u222b_0^{M\u03b8} log(2 sin t)dt + O(log n), uniformly in M; and similarly for \u2211 log(2 cos(k\u03b8)) (with care near \u03c0/2). Provide constants via monotone sum\u2013integral bounds and sin x \u2265 (2/\u03c0)min{x,\u03c0\u2212x}.\\n2) Present the ratio test R_n(i)=C_{n,i+1}/C_{n,i} and show unimodality with peak near n/3 (optional but clean).\\n3) Include a brief proof or citation: v3=Cl2(\u03c0/3)=3\u039b(\u03c0/3), V=2v3.\\n4) Optional: refine to second order to obtain a \u221an prefactor.\\n\\nBottom line: The task\u2019s original V/(2\u03c0) exponent is inconsistent with the single-term lower bound; the correct rate is V/\u03c0.
