All provers correctly obtain a sine-product form and a Laplace-type rate with a unique maximizer at i≈n/3. The maximal rate evaluates to F(π/6)=3Λ(π/3)=v3, yielding max log term (2/π)v3·n=(V/π)n. Positivity then gives log f_n(e^{π i/n})=(V/π)n+O(log n). The original claim’s exponent V/(2π) is off by a factor 2. To finalize: provide uniform O(log n) sum–integral bounds, a brief Clausen/Lobachevsky identity reference, and a clean localization (ratio test).
