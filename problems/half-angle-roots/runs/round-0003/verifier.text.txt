{"feedback_md":"Status: The reduction to a sine-product and a one-dimensional Laplace principle is correct and consistent across provers. The unique maximizer is at i≈n/3. The correct exponential rate is V/π, not V/(2π). The main remaining gaps are (i) uniform and fully rigorous sum–integral bounds with explicit O(log n) errors, (ii) a clean evaluation of the maximized rate via standard Clausen/Lobachevsky identities, and (iii) tidying minor inconsistencies (definitions, endpoint i=n, and an overly strong O(1) claim).\n\nAudit by prover:\n- Prover 1: The sum–integral lemma using |cot| is sound and yields uniform O(log n) error. There is a notational inconsistency: you defined Φ(α) with an extra 1/π and then wrote log C_{n,i}=(2n/π)Φ(α). This double 1/π can confuse constants; please fix by working with F(x)=Λ(2x)+2Λ(π/2−x) and log C_{n,i}=(2n/π)F(x)+O(log n). Your evaluation at α=1/3 is correct: F(π/6)=3Λ(π/3)=Cl2(π/3)=v3, hence max log term =(2n/π)v3=(V/π)n. Cite the identity 2 Cl2(π/3)=3 Cl2(2π/3) or directly v3=Cl2(π/3).\n- Prover 2: The block-sum approach is good. However, Proposition 4’s error Oδ(1) after dividing by θ for the lower block starting at 0 is not correct as stated: Lemma 3 gives a θ(1+|log θ|) term, which becomes O(log n) upon dividing by θ. Unless you implement a cancellation scheme (e.g., subtract small-k asymptotics exactly), the natural uniform error remains O(log n). This does not harm the main result. The localization (Gaussian window) argument is fine for an O(log n) aggregate error.\n- Prover 3: Clear and correct high-level path. Please add explicit statements/proofs (or references) for (a) the uniform O(log n) sum–integral inequalities and (b) the identity 3Λ(π/3)=Cl2(π/3)=v3 and V=2v3.\n\nKey corrections/clarifications:\n- Endpoint i=n: C_{n,n}=1 as a rational function; the sine product has a removable 0/0. Avoid the cosine form at i=n.\n- Positivity: For 0≤i≤n−1, all factors lie in (0,π), hence C_{n,i}>0. Then max C_{n,i}≤f_n≤(n+1)max C_{n,i} and log f_n= max log C_{n,i}+O(log n).\n- Normalization: Use F(x)=Λ(2x)+2Λ(π/2−x). Then F′(x)=2(log(2cos x)−log(2sin 2x)), unique maximizer at x=π/6, and F(π/6)=v3.\n\nConcrete next steps:\n1) Write a self-contained lemma: for θ=π/(2n) and 1≤M≤2n−1, ∑_{k=1}^M log(2 sin(kθ)) = θ^{-1}∫_0^{Mθ} log(2 sin t)dt + O(log n), uniformly in M; and similarly for ∑ log(2 cos(kθ)) (with care near π/2). Provide constants via monotone sum–integral bounds and sin x ≥ (2/π)min{x,π−x}.\n2) Present the ratio test R_n(i)=C_{n,i+1}/C_{n,i} and show unimodality with peak near n/3 (optional but clean).\n3) Include a brief proof or citation: v3=Cl2(π/3)=3Λ(π/3), V=2v3.\n4) Optional: refine to second order to obtain a √n prefactor.\n\nBottom line: The task’s original V/(2π) exponent is inconsistent with the single-term lower bound; the correct rate is V/π. The remaining work is routine but must be written carefully.\n","summary_md":"All provers correctly obtain a sine-product form and a Laplace-type rate with a unique maximizer at i≈n/3.
