Proved schedule verification equivalence (S_1..S_t wins iff R_t=\u2205 with R_{i+1}=N(R_i)\\S_{i+1}), subgraph monotonicity, lower bounds h(G)\u2265\u03b4(G) and hence \u2265 degeneracy(G), and the upper bound h(G)\u2264\u03c4(G) (capture by shooting a minimum vertex cover twice). Determined exact values h(K_n)=n\u22121 and h(K_{p,q})=min{p,q}; cycles: C_3,C_4 have h=2 and an explicit 4-round 2-hunter schedule shows h(C_5)\u22642 (odd cycles require time-varying schedules). Algorithmically: fast NO filters (degeneracy>k or \u03c9(G)\u2265k+2) and fast YES via \u03c4(G)\u2264k, but NP-membership is unresolved because winning schedules may need unbounded length. Open targets: prove h(C_n)=2, classify h(G)=1, and investigate h(G)\u2264tw(G) or an n^{O(k)} separator DP. Citations: proofs.md; research notes.",
