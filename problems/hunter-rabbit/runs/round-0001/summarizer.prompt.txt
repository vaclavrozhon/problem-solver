Definitions.
• The hunters and rabbit problem is a pursuit-evasion game played
on an undirected graph. A strategy for k hunters is a sequence
s1, s2, · · · , sn of subsets of k vertices. A strategy is winning if, for
every walk v1, v2, · · · , vn in the graph (not necessarily simple), there
is i such that vi ∈ si. Intuitively, the evader is walking on the graph
(it has to move at each turn by following exactly one edge) and must
avoid the k vertices that the pursuers examine at each time step.

• The evasion number of a graph G is the smallest k for which there
is a winning strategy with k hunters.

Question: Is it the case that, for any constant k , we can recognize
the graphs of the evasion number k in polynomial time? (E.g. n^{O(k)})

Working definitions and dynamics
- We fix the open-neighborhood operator N(X)=⋃_{x∈X}N(x). For a schedule S_1, …, S_t (|S_i|≤k), define R_1:=V\S_1 and R_{i+1}:=N(R_i)\S_{i+1}. The schedule is winning up to horizon t iff R_t=∅. Equivalently, using P_1:=V and P_{i+1}:=N(P_i\S_i), the schedule wins iff P_{t+1}=∅. These are equivalent formulations under an index shift.

Verified results we will use
- Subgraph monotonicity: If H⊆G then h(H)≤h(G).
- Upper bound: h(G)≤τ(G) by shooting a minimum vertex cover twice (capture by time 2).
- Lower bounds: h(G)≥δ(G); therefore h(G)≥degeneracy(G). Also, if G contains K_{s,t} as a subgraph then h(G)≥min{s,t}.
- Exact values: h(K_n)=n−1; h(K_{p,q})=min{p,q}. For cycles, h(C_3)=2 (clique), h(C_4)=2; for C_5 a concrete 4-round schedule with k=2 succeeds (see proofs.md). The claim that two fixed antipodal shots per round win on all cycles is false for odd n.

Corrections to earlier claims
- The statement h(K_n)=n is incorrect; n−1 hunters suffice (and are necessary by δ(K_n)=n−1).
- The 1-hunter impossibility on P_n for n≥4 is false; e.g., P_4 has an explicit 1-hunter winning schedule. A general proof that h(P_n)=1 appears feasible but is not yet written.
- The assertion that the decision problem is in NP lacks a bound on schedule length; a priori, a winning schedule may require exponentially many rounds.

Concrete example (cycles)
- C_5 with k=2: S_1={1,3}, S_2={4,5}, S_3={2,4}, S_4={1,4} yields R_1={2,4,5}, R_2={1,3}, R_3={5}, R_4=∅. Thus h(C_5)≤2. For odd cycles, fixed pairs per round do not suffice; schedules must change over time.

Algorithmic consequences (current)
- Fast NO: if degeneracy(G)>k or ω(G)≥k+2 then h(G)>k.
- Fast YES: if τ(G)≤k then h(G)≤k (via FPT vertex-cover).
- These give n^{O(k)} filters but do not settle all instances.

Open targets and next steps
1) Prove h(C_n)=2 for all n≥3 (and record a general schedule). 2) Settle k=1: prove or refute “h(G)=1 iff G is a forest.” 3) Investigate structural upper bounds: does h(G)≤tw(G)? A positive answer implies polynomial recognition for fixed k. 4) Design a separator-based DP that simulates R-evolution with states depending only on boundary sets of size ≤k. 5) Empirically compute h on small graphs (n≤10) and all trees up to n≈12 to test the degeneracy-equality conjecture and discover obstructions.

# Main Results




=== Verifier Summary ===

We verified and recorded core facts: exact schedule-verification via R_{i+1}=N(R_i)\S_{i+1}; subgraph monotonicity; h(G)≤τ(G); h(K_n)=n−1; h(K_{p,q})=min{p,q}; lower bounds h(G)≥δ(G) and hence ≥degeneracy(G). Several claims were corrected: constant two-vertex schedules do not win on odd cycles; h(K_n)=n is false; 1 hunter can win on P_4; NP-membership of the general decision is unsubstantiated. We provided a correct 4-round 2-hunter schedule for C_5 as evidence that h(C_n)=2 may hold. Next priorities: (i) full proof that h(C_n)=2 for all n; (ii) resolve whether h(G)=1 iff G is a forest; (iii) investigate h ≤ treewidth or an n^{O(k)} DP on separators.

# Rigorous Proofs



Basic facts about the hunters–rabbit evasion number

Notation. For a finite simple graph G=(V,E), write N(X):=⋃_{x∈X}N(x) for the open neighborhood of X⊆V.

Definition (Schedule verification). Given a finite sequence S_1,…,S_t with S_i⊆V, define R_1:=V\S_1 and, for i≥1, R_{i+1}:=N(R_i)\S_{i+1}.

Proposition 1 (Equivalence). The sequence S_1,…,S_t is winning up to horizon t (i.e., for every walk v_1,…,v_t in G there exists i with v_i∈S_i) if and only if R_t=∅.
Proof. For each i, R_i is exactly the set of vertices w for which there exists a length-i walk v_1,…,v_i=w with v_j∉S_j for all j≤i. This holds by induction on i using the recurrence definition. Thus R_t=∅ iff no length-t walk avoids all S_i. ∎

Lemma 2 (Subgraph monotonicity). If H is a subgraph of G, then h(H)≤h(G).
Proof. Any walk in H is also a walk in G. A schedule that hits all walks in G hits all walks confined to H. ∎

Proposition 3 (Vertex-cover upper bound). Let τ(G) be the size of a minimum vertex cover. Then h(G)≤τ(G).
Proof. Fix a minimum vertex cover C. Take S_1=C and S_2=C. If the rabbit starts in C it is caught at time 1. Otherwise it starts in V\C (an independent set), so R_1=V\C and R_2=N(R_1)\C⊆C\C=∅. Hence capture by time 2. ∎

Lemma 4 (Minimum-degree lower bound). If k<δ(G), then no schedule with k hunters is winning; in particular h(G)≥δ(G).
Proof. Fix k<δ(G) and any schedule S. Pick v_1∈V\S_1. Inductively, given v_i∉S_i, since deg(v_i)≥δ(G)>k and |S_{i+1}|≤k, there exists v_{i+1}∈N(v_i)\S_{i+1}. This constructs an avoiding walk of any length. ∎

Corollary 5 (Degeneracy lower bound). Let d(G) be the degeneracy (the maximum of δ(H) over all subgraphs H of G). Then h(G)≥d(G).
Proof. Choose H⊆G with δ(H)=d(G). By Lemma 4 applied to H, h(H)≥d(G). By Lemma 2, h(G)≥h(H). ∎

Corollary 6 (Complete graphs). For n≥1, h(K_n)=n−1.
Proof. Lower bound: δ(K_n)=n−1 and Lemma 4. Upper bound: with k=n−1, take S_i=V\{x} for a fixed x. Then R_1={x} and R_2=N({x})\(V\{x})=∅. ∎

Proposition 7 (Complete bipartite graphs). For K_{p,q} with p≤q, h(K_{p,q})=p.
Proof. Lower bound: δ(K_{p,q})=p, so h≥p by Lemma 4. Upper bound: take S_i to be the p-vertex side A each round. If the walk starts in A, it is caught at i=1. Otherwise it starts in B and must move to A at i=2, where it is shot. ∎

Proposition 8 (Graphs containing a cycle need at least two hunters). If G contains a cycle as a subgraph, then h(G)≥2.
Proof. Every cycle C_m has δ(C_m)=2, hence h(C_m)≥2 by Lemma 4. By Lemma 2, h(G)≥h(C_m)≥2. ∎

Example 9 (C_5 is 2-hunter-catchable). On the 5-cycle with vertices 1–2–3–4–5–1, let
S_1={1,3}, S_2={4,5}, S_3={2,4}, S_4={1,4}.
Then R_1=V\S_1={2,4,5}; R_2=N(R_1)\S_2={1,3,4,5}\{4,5}={1,3}; R_3=N(R_2)\S_3={2,4,5}\{2,4}={5}; R_4=N({5})\S_4={1,4}\{1,4}=∅. Hence h(C_5)≤2.

Remarks. We have not yet proved h(C_m)=2 for all m≥3 (odd m require nontrivial schedules), nor the classification h(G)=1 iff G is a forest. These remain open targets.
