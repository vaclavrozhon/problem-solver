We found an equivalence between R recurrence and scheduling, alongside concepts like subgraph monotonicity and lower bounds in degeneracy. I need to highlight fixed values for complete graphs and bipartite graphs, results on cycles like C3 and C4, and the implications for algorithmic filters, both fast NO and YES.
