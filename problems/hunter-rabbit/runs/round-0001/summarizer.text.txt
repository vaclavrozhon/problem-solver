{"summary_md":"Recorded and verified core definitions and elementary bounds for the hunters–rabbit evasion number h(G). Proved schedule verification equivalence (S_1..S_t wins iff R_t=∅ with R_{i+1}=N(R_i)\\S_{i+1}), subgraph monotonicity, lower bounds h(G)≥δ(G) and hence ≥ degeneracy(G), and the upper bound h(G)≤τ(G) (capture by shooting a minimum vertex cover twice). Determined exact values h(K_n)=n−1 and h(K_{p,q})=min{p,q}; cycles: C_3,C_4 have h=2 and an explicit 4-round 2-hunter schedule shows h(C_5)≤2 (odd cycles require time-varying schedules). Algorithmically: fast NO filters (degeneracy>k or ω(G)≥k+2) and fast YES via τ(G)≤k, but NP-membership is unresolved because winning schedules may need unbounded length. Open targets: prove h(C_n)=2, classify h(G)=1, and investigate h(G)≤tw(G) or an n^{O(k)} separator DP.
