Overall: good formalization progress, but multiple factual errors and unproven claims remain. We can extract several rigorous lemmas (state-evolution equivalence; subgraph monotonicity; vertex-cover upper bound; lower bounds via minimum degree/degeneracy; exact values for K_n and K_{p,q}). Claims about cycles and k=1 need correction and full proofs.

Key issues per prover
- P1: The dynamics P_{i+1}=N(P_i \ S_i) is correct, and the bounds h ≥ ω−1 and h ≤ τ are valid. However, the claim “cycles: two antipodal vertices every round” is false for odd cycles (e.g., on C_5, {1,3} each round fails: the walk 4,5,4,5,… survives). Your worked C_5 schedule has a computation mistake under the P-recursion; with the R-recursion (R_1=V\S_1; R_{i+1}=N(R_i)\S_{i+1}), a correct 4-round 2-hunter schedule exists (see proofs.md Example). The path P_4 example is consistent. Keep cycle results as conjectural until fully proved for all n.
- P2: Several incorrect claims: h(K_n)=n is false; the correct value is n−1 (schedule S_i=V\{x} captures by time 2). Also, “1 hunter fails on P_n for n≥4” is false (P_4 has a 1-hunter winning schedule; see P1). The “in NP” assertion is unjustified: a winning schedule may require exponentially many rounds a priori; no polynomially bounded certificate is known for general k. Good contributions: layered-DAG verification for a fixed schedule; K_{s,t} lower bound; K_{p,q} exact; subgraph monotonicity; vertex-cover upper bound.
- P3: The theorem “h(G)=1 iff G is a forest” is attractive but the provided proof is flawed: the identity P′=N(N(P)\{u})\{u} after two shots at u is not generally valid, and the permanence of leaf deletions does not follow. The direction “cycle ⇒ 1 hunter fails” does hold by subgraph monotonicity plus δ(C_m)=2. Keep this as a research target; either supply a correct inductive proof or find a counterexample.
- P4: Degeneracy lower bound and exact values for K_n, K_{a,b}, and cycles’ lower bound are correct. The proof that fixed {u,v} on cycles gives R_2=∅ is wrong (for odd m, N(V\{u,v})=V, so R_2=V\{u,v}≠∅). The conjecture e(G)=degeneracy is plausible but unproven; prioritize searching for a counterexample or a proof strategy.

Concrete next steps
1) Solidify core facts (now in proofs.md). 2) Prove h(C_n)=2 for all n≥3 (we included a correct C_5 schedule). 3) Settle k=1: prove or refute “h(G)=1 iff G is a forest.” 4) Explore whether h ≤ treewidth holds (would imply n^{O(k)} recognition). 5) Develop a separator-based DP for deciding h(G)≤k in n^{O(k)} time. 6) Empirically compute h on all graphs up to n=10 (and all trees up to n=12) to test the degeneracy-equality conjecture and guide proofs.
