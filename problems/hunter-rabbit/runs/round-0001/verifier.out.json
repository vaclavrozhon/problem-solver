  "feedback_md": "Overall: good formalization progress, but multiple factual errors and unproven claims remain. We can extract several rigorous lemmas (state-evolution equivalence; subgraph monotonicity; vertex-cover upper bound; lower bounds via minimum degree/degeneracy; exact values for K_n and K_{p,q}). Claims about cycles and k=1 need correction and full proofs.\n\nKey issues per prover\n- P1: The dynamics P_{i+1}=N(P_i \\ S_i) is correct, and the bounds h \u2265 \u03c9\u22121 and h \u2264 \u03c4 are valid. However, the claim \u201ccycles: two antipodal vertices every round\u201d is false for odd cycles (e.g., on C_5, {1,3} each round fails: the walk 4,5,4,5,\u2026 survives). Your worked C_5 schedule has a computation mistake under the P-recursion; with the R-recursion (R_1=V\\S_1; R_{i+1}=N(R_i)\\S_{i+1}), a correct 4-round 2-hunter schedule exists (see proofs.md Example). The path P_4 example is consistent. Keep cycle results as conjectural until fully proved for all n.\n- P2: Several incorrect claims: h(K_n)=n is false; the correct value is n\u22121 (schedule S_i=V\\{x} captures by time 2). Also, \u201c1 hunter fails on P_n for n\u22654\u201d is false (P_4 has a 1-hunter winning schedule; see P1). The \u201cin NP\u201d assertion is unjustified: a winning schedule may require exponentially many rounds a priori; no polynomially bounded certificate is known for general k. Good contributions: layered-DAG verification for a fixed schedule; K_{s,t} lower bound; K_{p,q} exact; subgraph monotonicity; vertex-cover upper bound.\n- P3: The theorem \u201ch(G)=1 iff G is a forest\u201d is attractive but the provided proof is flawed: the identity P\u2032=N(N(P)\\{u})\\{u} after two shots at u is not generally valid, and the permanence of leaf deletions does not follow. The direction \u201ccycle \u21d2 1 hunter fails\u201d does hold by subgraph monotonicity plus \u03b4(C_m)=2. Keep this as a research target; either supply a correct inductive proof or find a counterexample.\n- P4: Degeneracy lower bound and exact values for K_n, K_{a,b}, and cycles\u2019 lower bound are correct. The proof that fixed {u,v} on cycles gives R_2=\u2205 is wrong (for odd m, N(V\\{u,v})=V, so R_2=V\\{u,v}\u2260\u2205). The conjecture e(G)=degeneracy is plausible but unproven; prioritize searching for a counterexample or a proof strategy.\n\nConcrete next steps\n1) Solidify core facts (now in proofs.md). 2) Prove h(C_n)=2 for all n\u22653 (we included a correct C_5 schedule). 3) Settle k=1: prove or refute \u201ch(G)=1 iff G is a forest.\u201d 4) Explore whether h \u2264 treewidth holds (would imply n^{O(k)} recognition). 5) Develop a separator-based DP for deciding h(G)\u2264k in n^{O(k)} time. 6) Empirically compute h on all graphs up to n=10 (and all trees up to n=12) to test the degeneracy-equality conjecture and guide proofs.",

Several claims were corrected: constant two-vertex schedules do not win on odd cycles; h(K_n)=n is false; 1 hunter can win on P_4; NP-membership of the general decision is unsubstantiated. We provided a correct 4-round 2-hunter schedule for C_5 as evidence that h(C_n)=2 may hold.

Equivalently, using P_1:=V and P_{i+1}:=N(P_i\\S_i), the schedule wins iff P_{t+1}=\u2205. These are equivalent formulations under an index shift.\n\nVerified results we will use\n- Subgraph monotonicity: If H\u2286G then h(H)\u2264h(G).\n- Upper bound: h(G)\u2264\u03c4(G) by shooting a minimum vertex cover twice (capture by time 2).\n- Lower bounds: h(G)\u2265\u03b4(G); therefore h(G)\u2265degeneracy(G). Also, if G contains K_{s,t} as a subgraph then h(G)\u2265min{s,t}.\n- Exact values: h(K_n)=n\u22121; h(K_{p,q})=min{p,q}. For cycles, h(C_3)=2 (clique), h(C_4)=2; for C_5 a concrete 4-round schedule with k=2 succeeds (see proofs.md). The claim that two fixed antipodal shots per round win on all cycles is false for odd n.\n\nCorrections to earlier claims\n- The statement h(K_n)=n is incorrect; n\u22121 hunters suffice (and are necessary by \u03b4(K_n)=n\u22121).\n- The 1-hunter impossibility on P_n for n\u22654 is false; e.g., P_4 has an explicit 1-hunter winning schedule. A general proof that h(P_n)=1 appears feasible but is not yet written.\n- The assertion that the decision problem is in NP lacks a bound on schedule length; a priori, a winning schedule may require exponentially many rounds.\n\nConcrete example (cycles)\n- C_5 with k=2: S_1={1,3}, S_2={4,5}, S_3={2,4}, S_4={1,4} yields R_1={2,4,5}, R_2={1,3}, R_3={5}, R_4=\u2205. Thus h(C_5)\u22642.

For a finite simple graph G=(V,E), write N(X):=\u22c3_{x\u2208X}N(x) for the open neighborhood of X\u2286V.\n\nDefinition (Schedule verification). Given a finite sequence S_1,\u2026,S_t with S_i\u2286V, define R_1:=V\\S_1 and, for i\u22651, R_{i+1}:=N(R_i)\\S_{i+1}.\n\nProposition 1 (Equivalence). The sequence S_1,\u2026,S_t is winning up to horizon t (i.e., for every walk v_1,\u2026,v_t in G there exists i with v_i\u2208S_i) if and only if R_t=\u2205.\nProof. For each i, R_i is exactly the set of vertices w for which there exists a length-i walk v_1,\u2026,v_i=w with v_j\u2209S_j for all j\u2264i. This holds by induction on i using the recurrence definition. Thus R_t=\u2205 iff no length-t walk avoids all S_i. \u220e\n\nLemma 2 (Subgraph monotonicity). If H is a subgraph of G, then h(H)\u2264h(G).\nProof. Any walk in H is also a walk in G. A schedule that hits all walks in G hits all walks confined to H. \u220e\n\nProposition 3 (Vertex-cover upper bound). Let \u03c4(G) be the size of a minimum vertex cover. Then h(G)\u2264\u03c4(G).\nProof. Fix a minimum vertex cover C. Take S_1=C and S_2=C. If the rabbit starts in C it is caught at time 1. Otherwise it starts in V\\C (an independent set), so R_1=V\\C and R_2=N(R_1)\\C\u2286C\\C=\u2205. Hence capture by time 2. \u220e\n\nLemma 4 (Minimum-degree lower bound). If k<\u03b4(G), then no schedule with k hunters is winning; in particular h(G)\u2265\u03b4(G).\nProof. Fix k<\u03b4(G) and any schedule S. Pick v_1\u2208V\\S_1. Inductively, given v_i\u2209S_i, since deg(v_i)\u2265\u03b4(G)>k and |S_{i+1}|\u2264k, there exists v_{i+1}\u2208N(v_i)\\S_{i+1}. This constructs an avoiding walk of any length. \u220e\n\nCorollary 5 (Degeneracy lower bound). Let d(G) be the degeneracy (the maximum of \u03b4(H) over all subgraphs H of G). Then h(G)\u2265d(G).\nProof. Choose H\u2286G with \u03b4(H)=d(G). By Lemma 4 applied to H, h(H)\u2265d(G). By Lemma 2, h(G)\u2265h(H). \u220e\n\nCorollary 6 (Complete graphs). For n\u22651, h(K_n)=n\u22121.\nProof. Lower bound: \u03b4(K_n)=n\u22121 and Lemma 4. Upper bound: with k=n\u22121, take S_i=V\\{x} for a fixed x. Then R_1={x} and R_2=N({x})\\(V\\{x})=\u2205. \u220e\n\nProposition 7 (Complete bipartite graphs). For K_{p,q} with p\u2264q, h(K_{p,q})=p.\nProof. Lower bound: \u03b4(K_{p,q})=p, so h\u2265p by Lemma 4. Upper bound: take S_i to be the p-vertex side A each round. If the walk starts in A, it is caught at i=1. Otherwise it starts in B and must move to A at i=2, where it is shot. \u220e\n\nProposition 8 (Graphs containing a cycle need at least two hunters). If G contains a cycle as a subgraph, then h(G)\u22652.\nProof. Every cycle C_m has \u03b4(C_m)=2, hence h(C_m)\u22652 by Lemma 4. By Lemma 2, h(G)\u2265h(C_m)\u22652. \u220e\n\nExample 9 (C_5 is 2-hunter-catchable). On the 5-cycle with vertices 1\u20132\u20133\u20134\u20135\u20131, let\nS_1={1,3}, S_2={4,5}, S_3={2,4}, S_4={1,4}.\nThen R_1=V\\S_1={2,4,5}; R_2=N(R_1)\\S_2={1,3,4,5}\\{4,5}={1,3}; R_3=N(R_2)\\S_3={2,4,5}\\{2,4}={5}; R_4=N({5})\\S_4={1,4}\\{1,4}=\u2205. Hence h(C_5)\u22642.\n\nRemarks. We have not yet proved h(C_m)=2 for all m\u22653 (odd m require nontrivial schedules), nor the classification h(G)=1 iff G is a forest. These remain open targets."
