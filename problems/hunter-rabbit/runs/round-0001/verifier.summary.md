We verified and recorded core facts: exact schedule-verification via R_{i+1}=N(R_i)\S_{i+1}; subgraph monotonicity; h(G)≤τ(G); h(K_n)=n−1; h(K_{p,q})=min{p,q}; lower bounds h(G)≥δ(G) and hence ≥degeneracy(G). Several claims were corrected: constant two-vertex schedules do not win on odd cycles; h(K_n)=n is false; 1 hunter can win on P_4; NP-membership of the general decision is unsubstantiated. We provided a correct 4-round 2-hunter schedule for C_5 as evidence that h(C_n)=2 may hold. Next priorities: (i) full proof that h(C_n)=2 for all n; (ii) resolve whether h(G)=1 iff G is a forest; (iii) investigate h ≤ treewidth or an n^{O(k)} DP on separators.
