  "feedback_md": "Overall: good formalization progress, but multiple factual errors and unproven claims remain. We can extract several rigorous lemmas (state-evolution equivalence; subgraph monotonicity; vertex-cover upper bound; lower bounds via minimum degree/degeneracy; exact values for K_n and K_{p,q}). Claims about cycles and k=1 need correction and full proofs.\n\nKey issues per prover\n- P1: The dynamics P_{i+1}=N(P_i \\ S_i) is correct, and the bounds h ≥ ω−1 and h ≤ τ are valid. However, the claim “cycles: two antipodal vertices every round” is false for odd cycles (e.g., on C_5, {1,3} each round fails: the walk 4,5,4,5,… survives). Your worked C_5 schedule has a computation mistake under the P-recursion; with the R-recursion (R_1=V\\S_1; R_{i+1}=N(R_i)\\S_{i+1}), a correct 4-round 2-hunter schedule exists (see proofs.md Example). The path P_4 example is consistent. Keep cycle results as conjectural until fully proved for all n.\n- P2: Several incorrect claims: h(K_n)=n is false; the correct value is n−1 (schedule S_i=V\\{x} captures by time 2). Also, “1 hunter fails on P_n for n≥4” is false (P_4 has a 1-hunter winning schedule; see P1). The “in NP” assertion is unjustified: a winning schedule may require exponentially many rounds a priori; no polynomially bounded certificate is known for general k. Good contributions: layered-DAG verification for a fixed schedule; K_{s,t} lower bound; K_{p,q} exact; subgraph monotonicity; vertex-cover upper bound.\n- P3: The theorem “h(G)=1 iff G is a forest” is attractive but the provided proof is flawed: the identity P′=N(N(P)\\{u})\\{u} after two shots at u is not generally valid, and the permanence of leaf deletions does not follow. The direction “cycle ⇒ 1 hunter fails” does hold by subgraph monotonicity plus δ(C_m)=2. Keep this as a research target; either supply a correct inductive proof or find a counterexample.\n- P4: Degeneracy lower bound and exact values for K_n, K_{a,b}, and cycles’ lower bound are correct. The proof that fixed {u,v} on cycles gives R_2=∅ is wrong (for odd m, N(V\\{u,v})=V, so R_2=V\\{u,v}≠∅). The conjecture e(G)=degeneracy is plausible but unproven; prioritize searching for a counterexample or a proof strategy.\n\nConcrete next steps\n1) Solidify core facts (now in proofs.md). 2) Prove h(C_n)=2 for all n≥3 (we included a correct C_5 schedule). 3) Settle k=1: prove or refute “h(G)=1 iff G is a forest.” 4) Explore whether h ≤ treewidth holds (would imply n^{O(k)} recognition). 5) Develop a separator-based DP for deciding h(G)≤k in n^{O(k)} time. 6) Empirically compute h on all graphs up to n=10 (and all trees up to n=12) to test the degeneracy-equality conjecture and guide proofs.",

Several claims were corrected: constant two-vertex schedules do not win on odd cycles; h(K_n)=n is false; 1 hunter can win on P_4; NP-membership of the general decision is unsubstantiated. We provided a correct 4-round 2-hunter schedule for C_5 as evidence that h(C_n)=2 may hold. Next priorities: (i) full proof that h(C_n)=2 for all n; (ii) resolve whether h(G)=1 iff G is a forest; (iii) investigate h ≤ treewidth or an n^{O(k)} DP on separators.",

The schedule is winning up to horizon t iff R_t=∅. Equivalently, using P_1:=V and P_{i+1}:=N(P_i\\S_i), the schedule wins iff P_{t+1}=∅. These are equivalent formulations under an index shift.\n\nVerified results we will use\n- Subgraph monotonicity: If H⊆G then h(H)≤h(G).\n- Upper bound: h(G)≤τ(G) by shooting a minimum vertex cover twice (capture by time 2).\n- Lower bounds: h(G)≥δ(G); therefore h(G)≥degeneracy(G). Also, if G contains K_{s,t} as a subgraph then h(G)≥min{s,t}.\n- Exact values: h(K_n)=n−1; h(K_{p,q})=min{p,q}. For cycles, h(C_3)=2 (clique), h(C_4)=2; for C_5 a concrete 4-round schedule with k=2 succeeds (see proofs.md). The claim that two fixed antipodal shots per round win on all cycles is false for odd n.\n\nCorrections to earlier claims\n- The statement h(K_n)=n is incorrect; n−1 hunters suffice (and are necessary by δ(K_n)=n−1).\n- The 1-hunter impossibility on P_n for n≥4 is false; e.g., P_4 has an explicit 1-hunter winning schedule. A general proof that h(P_n)=1 appears feasible but is not yet written.\n- The assertion that the decision problem is in NP lacks a bound on schedule length; a priori, a winning schedule may require exponentially many rounds.\n\nConcrete example (cycles)\n- C_5 with k=2: S_1={1,3}, S_2={4,5}, S_3={2,4}, S_4={1,4} yields R_1={2,4,5}, R_2={1,3}, R_3={5}, R_4=∅. Thus h(C_5)≤2. For odd cycles, fixed pairs per round do not suffice; schedules must change over time.\n\nAlgorithmic consequences (current)\n- Fast NO: if degeneracy(G)>k or ω(G)≥k+2 then h(G)>k.\n- Fast YES: if τ(G)≤k then h(G)≤k (via FPT vertex-cover).\n- These give n^{O(k)} filters but do not settle all instances.\n\nOpen targets and next steps\n1) Prove h(C_n)=2 for all n≥3 (and record a general schedule). 2) Settle k=1: prove or refute “h(G)=1 iff G is a forest.” 3) Investigate structural upper bounds: does h(G)≤tw(G)? A positive answer implies polynomial recognition for fixed k. 4) Design a separator-based DP that simulates R-evolution with states depending only on boundary sets of size ≤k. 5) Empirically compute h on small graphs (n≤10) and all trees up to n≈12 to test the degeneracy-equality conjecture and discover obstructions."

    "content": "Basic facts about the hunters–rabbit evasion number\n\nNotation. For a finite simple graph G=(V,E), write N(X):=⋃_{x∈X}N(x) for the open neighborhood of X⊆V.\n\nDefinition (Schedule verification). Given a finite sequence S_1,…,S_t with S_i⊆V, define R_1:=V\\S_1 and, for i≥1, R_{i+1}:=N(R_i)\\S_{i+1}.\n\nProposition 1 (Equivalence). The sequence S_1,…,S_t is winning up to horizon t (i.e., for every walk v_1,…,v_t in G there exists i with v_i∈S_i) if and only if R_t=∅.\nProof. For each i, R_i is exactly the set of vertices w for which there exists a length-i walk v_1,…,v_i=w with v_j∉S_j for all j≤i. This holds by induction on i using the recurrence definition. Thus R_t=∅ iff no length-t walk avoids all S_i. ∎\n\nLemma 2 (Subgraph monotonicity). If H is a subgraph of G, then h(H)≤h(G).\nProof. Any walk in H is also a walk in G. A schedule that hits all walks in G hits all walks confined to H. ∎\n\nProposition 3 (Vertex-cover upper bound). Let τ(G) be the size of a minimum vertex cover. Then h(G)≤τ(G).\nProof. Fix a minimum vertex cover C. Take S_1=C and S_2=C. If the rabbit starts in C it is caught at time 1. Otherwise it starts in V\\C (an independent set), so R_1=V\\C and R_2=N(R_1)\\C⊆C\\C=∅. Hence capture by time 2. ∎\n\nLemma 4 (Minimum-degree lower bound). If k<δ(G), then no schedule with k hunters is winning; in particular h(G)≥δ(G).\nProof. Fix k<δ(G) and any schedule S. Pick v_1∈V\\S_1. Inductively, given v_i∉S_i, since deg(v_i)≥δ(G)>k and |S_{i+1}|≤k, there exists v_{i+1}∈N(v_i)\\S_{i+1}. This constructs an avoiding walk of any length. ∎\n\nCorollary 5 (Degeneracy lower bound). Let d(G) be the degeneracy (the maximum of δ(H) over all subgraphs H of G). Then h(G)≥d(G).\nProof. Choose H⊆G with δ(H)=d(G). By Lemma 4 applied to H, h(H)≥d(G). By Lemma 2, h(G)≥h(H). ∎\n\nCorollary 6 (Complete graphs). For n≥1, h(K_n)=n−1.\nProof. Lower bound: δ(K_n)=n−1 and Lemma 4. Upper bound: with k=n−1, take S_i=V\\{x} for a fixed x. Then R_1={x} and R_2=N({x})\\(V\\{x})=∅. ∎\n\nProposition 7 (Complete bipartite graphs). For K_{p,q} with p≤q, h(K_{p,q})=p.\nProof. Lower bound: δ(K_{p,q})=p, so h≥p by Lemma 4. Upper bound: take S_i to be the p-vertex side A each round. If the walk starts in A, it is caught at i=1. Otherwise it starts in B and must move to A at i=2, where it is shot. ∎\n\nProposition 8 (Graphs containing a cycle need at least two hunters). If G contains a cycle as a subgraph, then h(G)≥2.\nProof. Every cycle C_m has δ(C_m)=2, hence h(C_m)≥2 by Lemma 4. By Lemma 2, h(G)≥h(C_m)≥2. ∎\n\nExample 9 (C_5 is 2-hunter-catchable). On the 5-cycle with vertices 1–2–3–4–5–1, let\nS_1={1,3}, S_2={4,5}, S_3={2,4}, S_4={1,4}.\nThen R_1=V\\S_1={2,4,5}; R_2=N(R_1)\\S_2={1,3,4,5}\\{4,5}={1,3}; R_3=N(R_2)\\S_3={2,4,5}\\{2,4}={5}; R_4=N({5})\\S_4={1,4}\\{1,4}=∅. Hence h(C_5)≤2.\n\nRemarks. We have not yet proved h(C_m)=2 for all m≥3 (odd m require nontrivial schedules), nor the classification h(G)=1 iff G is a forest. These remain open targets."
