  "content": "Ideas\n- Strengthen structural control of the dynamics R_{i+1}=N(R_i)\\S_{i+1} via \u201cpermanent blockers.\u201d This yields compositional upper bounds and a clean reduction tool.\n- Consolidate exact computations on basic families: complete bipartite graphs, small cycles, and a new explicit 2-hunter capture on C_6. Use these to calibrate conjectures for general cycles.\n- Explore odd cycles with k=2 to detect a genuine obstruction (C_7 as a focal instance). Formulate small, checkable lemmas about how small R-sets evolve on C_{2m+1}.\n- Outline a separator-based approach parameterized by a permanently shot set U (|U|\u2264k) to confine the walk to G\u2212U and then argue within components. This gives immediate FPT-recognition for classes where h is known on G\u2212U (e.g., forests, cactus of bounded cycle length) and a general plan toward n^{O(k)}.\n\nLemmas and rigorous proofs\n- Lemma A (Permanent blockers). For any U\u2286V, if U\u2286S_i for all i, then any walk avoiding capture lies entirely in G\u2212U. Consequently, h(G) \u2264 |U| + h(G\u2212U).\n  Proof. If some walk visits u\u2208U at time t, then v_t=u\u2208S_t so the evader is caught. Hence every avoiding walk remains in V\\U. The remaining |S_i\\U| \u2264 k\u2212|U| shots can be scheduled as a winning strategy on G\u2212U with h(G\u2212U) hunters; adding the |U| blockers gives total \u2264 |U|+h(G\u2212U).\n\n- Lemma B (Exact value on complete bipartite graphs). For K_{p,q}, h(K_{p,q})=min{p,q}.\n  Proof. WLOG p\u2264q. Lower bound: \u03b4(K_{p,q})=p, hence h\u2265p. Upper bound: shoot all p vertices of the p-side at round 1 and again at round 2. Then R_1 is contained in the q-side, so R_2=N(R_1)\\(p-side)=\u2205.\n\n- Lemma C (Exact value on K_n). h(K_n)=n\u22121.\n  Proof. Lower bound: \u03b4(K_n)=n\u22121. Upper bound: shoot V\\{x} at round 1 and again at round 2.\n\n- Lemma D (Confinement via a single blocker). For any vertex u, if u\u2208S_i for all i, then any surviving walk is confined to G\u2212{u}. In particular, if H=G\u2212{u} then h(G) \u2264 1 + h(H) (a special case of Lemma A).\n\nConcrete examples and verified computations\n- C_5 with k=2 (re-verified under R-recursion). Let vertices 1\u20132\u20133\u20134\u20135\u20131.\n  S_1={1,3} \u21d2 R_1={2,4,5}.\n  S_2={4,5} \u21d2 R_2=N({2,4,5})\\{4,5}={1,3}.\n  S_3={2,4} \u21d2 R_3=N({1,3})\\{2,4}={5}.\n  S_4={1,4} \u21d2 R_4=N({5})\\{1,4}=\u2205.\n  Hence h(C_5)\u22642; together with \u03b4(C_5)=2 we get h(C_5)=2.\n\n- C_6 with k=2 (new explicit 4-round capture). Vertices 1\u20132\u20133\u20134\u20135\u20136\u20131.\n  S_1={1,3} \u21d2 R_1={2,4,5,6}.\n  S_2={4,6} \u21d2 R_2=N({2,4,5,6})\\{4,6}={1,3,5}.\n  S_3={2,4} \u21d2 R_3=N({1,3,5})\\{2,4}={6}.\n  S_4={1,5} \u21d2 R_4=N({6})\\{1,5}=\u2205.\n  Hence h(C_6)\u22642; and \u03b4(C_6)=2 gives h(C_6)=2.\n\nOdd cycles: insights and an obstruction pattern (to be tested on C_7)\n- Observation 1. On C_{2m+1}, a 3-set of vertices in alternating positions, e.g., {1,3,5}, has N({1,3,5}) of size 4 (e.g., {2,4,6,7} on C_7). Therefore one round with k=2 can reduce such a 3-set to exactly 2 vertices.\n- Observation 2. From a 2-set R={x,y} on C_{2m+1}:\n  \u2022 If x,y are nonadjacent, then |N(R)|=4 and one round can reduce to at best a 2-set.\n  \u2022 If x,y are adjacent, then |N(R)|=3 and one round can reduce to at best a 1- or 2-set; but with k=2, at least one vertex remains, so the next R has size \u22651 (never \u2205 in one step).\n- Practical barrier encountered on C_7. We found sequences that reach a 2-set (sometimes adjacent), but a robust, certified reduction from size 2 to 1 and then to \u2205 has not yet been found. This suggests two possibilities: (i) h(C_7)=2 but requires a longer, more delicate schedule; (ii) h(C_7)=3. A definitive answer needs a small-state exhaustive search (see Next steps).\n\nConsequences and corollaries\n- From Lemma A, any feedback vertex set F gives h(G) \u2264 |F| + h(G\u2212F). Thus, if one proves h(Forest)=1, it would follow that h(G) \u2264 fvs(G)+1. Even without that, Lemma A immediately yields n^{O(k)} recognition for the subclass {G : \u2203U\u2286V, |U|\u2264k\u22121, and h(G\u2212U)\u22641}, since testing h(H)\u22641 (on H=G\u2212U) reduces to the k=1 case.\n- The confinement trick (Lemma D) reduces cycle capture to path capture: if h(P_n)=1 is established, then h(C_n)\u22642 follows by fixing one blocker on some vertex u and playing the path schedule on C_n\u2212{u} with the second hunter.\n\nObstacles and corrections\n- The attractive identity h(G)=1 iff G is a forest remains open in the \u201cif\u201d direction. Counter-checks on stars (K_{1,r}) confirm h=1, and paths of small size (P_3,P_4) admit 1-hunter schedules; but a general proof is missing. Earlier flawed arguments invoking permanence of leaf deletions are discarded.\n- Even cycles behave more benignly for k=2 (C_6 captured in 4 rounds), but odd cycles require more care. The previous \u201cantipodal fixed-shot\u201d claim is false on odd cycles; schedules must adapt over time.\n\nNext steps (auditable, testable work)\n1) Decide C_7 with k=2 by exhaustive state search. State space for R is 2^{7} but symmetry reduces it; one can BFS on R-sets under all 21 choices of size-2 shots to determine reachability of \u2205 from V. This will settle whether h(C_7)=2 or 3 and guide general odd-cycle analysis.\n2) Prove h(P_n)=1. Target a clean invariant on paths (e.g., strictly decreasing measure based on the convex hull of R_i or a two-step shrink lemma for intervals). Verifier can test candidate schedules on P_n up to moderate n to refine the invariant.\n3) Use Lemma A to get immediate FPT recognizers in n^{O(k)} for graphs with small feedback vertex sets: enumerate U with |U|\u2264k\u22121, test k=1 on G\u2212U (once (2) is done). This yields an exact n^{O(k)} algorithm on that subclass.\n4) Build a separator DP skeleton: for a guessed permanent blocker set U (|U|\u2264k), confine to G\u2212U, decompose into blocks linked by U, and simulate R-evolution within blocks using at most k\u2212|U| shooters. Start with cactus and block graphs (where block-level behavior is simple), then generalize.\n5) Solidify the library of exact schedules: we now have K_n, K_{p,q}, C_5, C_6. Add explicit verified schedules (or lower bounds) for C_7, C_8, and small trees to calibrate conjectures and DP heuristics.\n\nSummary of concrete progress this round\n- Introduced and proved the permanent blockers lemma h(G) \u2264 |U|+h(G\u2212U), a useful reduction tool for structural algorithms.\n- Supplied a concise, correct 4-round 2-hunter capture schedule on C_6, sharpening the cycle picture; re-verified the C_5 schedule and the exact values for K_n and K_{p,q}.\n- Identified a precise obstruction pattern on odd cycles with k=2 and outlined a small-state BFS to settle C_7, the next critical test case.\n- Laid out a practical FPT route via small feedback vertex sets and a separator DP, contingent on resolving the k=1 case on forests."
