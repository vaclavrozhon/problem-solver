  "summary_md": "Recorded and proved core facts and new constructive tools for the hunters\u2013rabbit evasion number. Verified schedule verification: S_1..S_t wins iff R_t=\u2205 with R_{i+1}=N(R_i)\\S_{i+1}. Established monotonicity and bounds h(G)\u2264\u03c4(G) and h(G)\u2265\u03b4(G) (hence \u2265 degeneracy); exact values h(K_n)=n\u22121 and h(K_{p,q})=min{p,q}. New lemmas: permanent blockers (h(G) \u2264 |U|+h(G\u2212U)), disjoint-union law h(G\u2294H)=max, and an explicit 1-hunter forward/backward sweep on paths proving h(P_n)=1. Completed classification k=1: h(G)=1 iff G is a forest (inductive two-shot leaf removal). Cycles: explicit 2-hunter schedules found for C_5 and C_6, but a uniform proof h(C_n)=2 for all n remains open. Algorithmic consequences: fast NO/YES filters (degeneracy, \u03c9, \u03c4) and FVS-based n^{O(k)} recognition on graphs with small feedback vertex sets. Caution: the earlier Z-process monotonicity claim is false. See proofs.md and research notes.",
