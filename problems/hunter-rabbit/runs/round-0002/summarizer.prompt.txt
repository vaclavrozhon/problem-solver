Definitions.
• The hunters and rabbit problem is a pursuit-evasion game played
on an undirected graph. A strategy for k hunters is a sequence
s1, s2, · · · , sn of subsets of k vertices. A strategy is winning if, for
every walk v1, v2, · · · , vn in the graph (not necessarily simple), there
is i such that vi ∈ si. Intuitively, the evader is walking on the graph
(it has to move at each turn by following exactly one edge) and must
avoid the k vertices that the pursuers examine at each time step.

• The evasion number of a graph G is the smallest k for which there
is a winning strategy with k hunters.

Question: Is it the case that, for any constant k , we can recognize
the graphs of the evasion number k in polynomial time? (E.g. n^{O(k)})

Working definitions and dynamics
- We fix the open-neighborhood operator N(X)=⋃_{x∈X}N(x). For a schedule S_1, …, S_t (|S_i|≤k), define R_1:=V\S_1 and R_{i+1}:=N(R_i)\S_{i+1}. The schedule is winning up to horizon t iff R_t=∅. Equivalently, using P_1:=V and P_{i+1}:=N(P_i\S_i), the schedule wins iff P_{t+1}=∅. These are equivalent formulations under an index shift.

Verified results we will use
- Subgraph monotonicity: If H⊆G then h(H)≤h(G).
- Upper bound: h(G)≤τ(G) by shooting a minimum vertex cover twice (capture by time 2).
- Lower bounds: h(G)≥δ(G); therefore h(G)≥degeneracy(G). Also, if G contains K_{s,t} as a subgraph then h(G)≥min{s,t}.
- Exact values: h(K_n)=n−1; h(K_{p,q})=min{p,q}. For cycles, h(C_3)=2 (clique), h(C_4)=2; for C_5 a concrete 4-round schedule with k=2 succeeds (see proofs.md). The claim that two fixed antipodal shots per round win on all cycles is false for odd n.

Corrections to earlier claims
- The statement h(K_n)=n is incorrect; n−1 hunters suffice (and are necessary by δ(K_n)=n−1).
- The 1-hunter impossibility on P_n for n≥4 is false; e.g., P_4 has an explicit 1-hunter winning schedule. A general proof that h(P_n)=1 appears feasible but is not yet written.
- The assertion that the decision problem is in NP lacks a bound on schedule length; a priori, a winning schedule may require exponentially many rounds.

Concrete example (cycles)
- C_5 with k=2: S_1={1,3}, S_2={4,5}, S_3={2,4}, S_4={1,4} yields R_1={2,4,5}, R_2={1,3}, R_3={5}, R_4=∅. Thus h(C_5)≤2. For odd cycles, fixed pairs per round do not suffice; schedules must change over time.

Algorithmic consequences (current)
- Fast NO: if degeneracy(G)>k or ω(G)≥k+2 then h(G)>k.
- Fast YES: if τ(G)≤k then h(G)≤k (via FPT vertex-cover).
- These give n^{O(k)} filters but do not settle all instances.

Open targets and next steps
1) Prove h(C_n)=2 for all n≥3 (and record a general schedule). 2) Settle k=1: prove or refute “h(G)=1 iff G is a forest.” 3) Investigate structural upper bounds: does h(G)≤tw(G)? A positive answer implies polynomial recognition for fixed k. 4) Design a separator-based DP that simulates R-evolution with states depending only on boundary sets of size ≤k. 5) Empirically compute h on small graphs (n≤10) and all trees up to n≈12 to test the degeneracy-equality conjecture and discover obstructions.

New validated tools and results
- Permanent blockers. If U⊆V is shot every round, any avoiding walk stays in G−U, hence h(G) ≤ |U|+h(G−U). This enables reductions via feedback vertex sets and other separators.
- Disjoint unions. For graphs on disjoint vertex sets, h(G ⊔ H)=max{h(G),h(H)}. A concatenation of winning schedules for components suffices.
- Paths. A 1-hunter “forward/backward sweep” of length 2n−3 (shots 1,2,…,n−1,n−1,n−2,…,2) wins on P_n; a parity-invariant proof verifies R_{2n−3}=∅.
- k=1 classification. h(G)=1 iff G is a forest. Proof: cycles force ≥2 by δ=2; for forests, an inductive schedule repeatedly shoots a neighbor u of a leaf ℓ twice, then recurses on T−ℓ. A key fact: for any X and leaf ℓ with neighbor u, ℓ∉N(N(X)\{u}). This ensures ℓ never reappears in R after the double-shot.
- Cycles. Explicit 2-hunter captures verified on C_5 and C_6; odd cycles require time-varying shots. A uniform proof h(C_n)=2 for all n remains open.

Corrections and cautions
- The “Z-process” identity R_i=V\(Z_i∪S_i) with Z_{i+1}={v:N(v)⊆Z_i∪S_i} holds, but Z_i need not be monotone. Arguments relying on Z-monotonicity (e.g., h=degeneracy proof) are invalid.

Algorithmic implications (current)
- Exact k=1 recognition in linear time via acyclicity. For general k, fast filters: if degeneracy(G)>k (or ω(G)≥k+2), then NO; if τ(G)≤k, then YES (2-round capture using a vertex cover).
- Permanent blockers yield: if fvs(G)≤k−1 and h(forest)=1 (proved), then h(G)≤k, giving an n^{O(k)} recognition on that subclass by enumerating U (|U|≤k−1).

Next steps
1) Settle cycles: prove h(C_n)=2 for all n (start with exhaustive R-set BFS on C_7). 2) Formalize a separator-based DP that simulates R_{i+1}=N(R_i)\S_{i+1} across small boundaries (treewidth/FVS). 3) Evaluate the degeneracy-equality conjecture empirically on n≤10 and either prove or refute it. 4) Pursue either h≤tw (positive algorithmic route) or hardness for k=2 (layered gadgets) as a decisive direction on the main question.

# Main Results




=== Verifier Summary ===

We added rigor: (i) disjoint-union law h(G⊔H)=max; (ii) explicit proof that h(P_n)=1 via a 2n−3 “sweep” schedule; (iii) full k=1 classification h(G)=1 iff G is a forest with an inductive two-shot leaf argument; (iv) permanent blockers lemma h(G)≤|U|+h(G−U). Verified exact values: h(K_n)=n−1, h(K_{p,q})=min{p,q}; cycles C_5 and C_6 have 2-hunter schedules. The proposed equality h(G)=degeneracy(G) remains unproven; the given proof is flawed (Z_i not monotone; degeneracy-schedule fails on P_4). Next: settle h(C_n)=2, exploit small feedback vertex sets for n^{O(k)} recognition, and build a separator-based DP or hardness for k=2.

# Rigorous Proofs



Basic facts about the hunters–rabbit evasion number

Notation. For a finite simple graph G=(V,E), write N(X):=⋃_{x∈X}N(x) for the open neighborhood of X⊆V.

Definition (Schedule verification). Given a finite sequence S_1,…,S_t with S_i⊆V, define R_1:=V\S_1 and, for i≥1, R_{i+1}:=N(R_i)\S_{i+1}.

Proposition 1 (Equivalence). The sequence S_1,…,S_t is winning up to horizon t (i.e., for every walk v_1,…,v_t in G there exists i with v_i∈S_i) if and only if R_t=∅.
Proof. For each i, R_i is exactly the set of vertices w for which there exists a length-i walk v_1,…,v_i=w with v_j∉S_j for all j≤i. This holds by induction on i using the recurrence definition. Thus R_t=∅ iff no length-t walk avoids all S_i. ∎

Lemma 2 (Subgraph monotonicity). If H is a subgraph of G, then h(H)≤h(G).
Proof. Any walk in H is also a walk in G. A schedule that hits all walks in G hits all walks confined to H. ∎

Proposition 3 (Vertex-cover upper bound). Let τ(G) be the size of a minimum vertex cover. Then h(G)≤τ(G).
Proof. Fix a minimum vertex cover C. Take S_1=C and S_2=C. If the rabbit starts in C it is caught at time 1. Otherwise it starts in V\C (an independent set), so R_1=V\C and R_2=N(R_1)\C⊆C\C=∅. Hence capture by time 2. ∎

Lemma 4 (Minimum-degree lower bound). If k<δ(G), then no schedule with k hunters is winning; in particular h(G)≥δ(G).
Proof. Fix k<δ(G) and any schedule S. Pick v_1∈V\S_1. Inductively, given v_i∉S_i, since deg(v_i)≥δ(G)>k and |S_{i+1}|≤k, there exists v_{i+1}∈N(v_i)\S_{i+1}. This constructs an avoiding walk of any length. ∎

Corollary 5 (Degeneracy lower bound). Let d(G) be the degeneracy (the maximum of δ(H) over all subgraphs H of G). Then h(G)≥d(G).
Proof. Choose H⊆G with δ(H)=d(G). By Lemma 4 applied to H, h(H)≥d(G). By Lemma 2, h(G)≥h(H). ∎

Corollary 6 (Complete graphs). For n≥1, h(K_n)=n−1.
Proof. Lower bound: δ(K_n)=n−1 and Lemma 4. Upper bound: with k=n−1, take S_i=V\{x} for a fixed x. Then R_1={x} and R_2=N({x})\(V\{x})=∅. ∎

Proposition 7 (Complete bipartite graphs). For K_{p,q} with p≤q, h(K_{p,q})=p.
Proof. Lower bound: δ(K_{p,q})=p, so h≥p by Lemma 4. Upper bound: take S_i to be the p-vertex side A each round. If the walk starts in A, it is caught at i=1. Otherwise it starts in B and must move to A at i=2, where it is shot. ∎

Proposition 8 (Graphs containing a cycle need at least two hunters). If G contains a cycle as a subgraph, then h(G)≥2.
Proof. Every cycle C_m has δ(C_m)=2, hence h(C_m)≥2 by Lemma 4. By Lemma 2, h(G)≥h(C_m)≥2. ∎

Example 9 (C_5 is 2-hunter-catchable). On the 5-cycle with vertices 1–2–3–4–5–1, let
S_1={1,3}, S_2={4,5}, S_3={2,4}, S_4={1,4}.
Then R_1=V\S_1={2,4,5}; R_2=N(R_1)\S_2={1,3,4,5}\{4,5}={1,3}; R_3=N(R_2)\S_3={2,4,5}\{2,4}={5}; R_4=N({5})\S_4={1,4}\{1,4}=∅. Hence h(C_5)≤2.

Remarks. We have not yet proved h(C_m)=2 for all m≥3 (odd m require nontrivial schedules), nor the classification h(G)=1 iff G is a forest. These remain open targets.

Further rigorous results on the evasion number

Notation. For a graph G=(V,E), define N(X):=\bigcup_{x\in X} N(x). For a schedule (S_1,\dots,S_t), set R_1:=V\setminus S_1 and R_{i+1}:=N(R_i)\setminus S_{i+1}.

Lemma 10 (Disjoint unions). If G and H have disjoint vertex sets, then h(G \sqcup H)=\max\{h(G),h(H)\}.
Proof. Any walk lies within one component. If k\ge\max\{h(G),h(H)\}, take a winning schedule for G (using only vertices of G) followed by a winning schedule for H (using only vertices of H), and repeat. Each component’s R-set becomes empty during its respective block and remains empty thereafter (since N(\emptyset)=\emptyset). Conversely, if k<h(G) then restricting to walks in G shows h(G\sqcup H)\ge h(G); similarly h(G\sqcup H)\ge h(H). ∎

Lemma 11 (Permanent blockers). For any U\subseteq V, if U\subseteq S_i for all i, then any avoiding walk stays in G-U. Consequently, h(G) \le |U| + h(G-U).
Proof. If a walk visits u\in U at time t, then v_t\in S_t, a contradiction; hence all avoiding walks stay in V\setminus U. Using |U| blockers each round and an additional h(G-U) hunters to follow a winning schedule on G-U yields a winning schedule on G with per-round budget |U|+h(G-U). ∎

Theorem 12 (Paths). For every n\ge 2, h(P_n)=1.
Proof. Label P_n by 1,2,\dots,n along the path. Consider the 1-hunter schedule of length 2n−3:
S_1=\{1\}, S_2=\{2\},\dots,S_{n-1}=\{n-1\}, then S_n=\{n-1\}, S_{n+1}=\{n-2\},\dots,S_{2n-3}=\{2\}.
Phase I (forward). For 1\le j\le n−1,
R_j = \{i: i>j\} \cup \{ i: 1\le i\le j and i\equiv j+1 \pmod 2\}.
This holds by induction: R_1=\{2,\dots,n\}; if it holds for j, then N(\{i>j\})=[j,\dots,n] and N(\{i\le j,\ i\equiv j+1\})=\{i:1\le i\le j+1,\ i\equiv j\}, and removing S_{j+1}=\{j+1\} gives the claimed R_{j+1}. In particular, R_{n−1}=\{i: i\equiv n \pmod 2\}.
Phase II (backward). Let r\in\{1,\dots,n−2\}. One checks by induction on r that after S_{n−1+r}=\{n−r\}, R_{n−1+r} is the arithmetic progression of the parity opposite to R_{n−1}, truncated to its largest element m:=n−r−2. Its neighborhood before removing S_{n+r}=\{m+1\} is the complementary parity up to m+1; removing S_{n+r} deletes the top element, leaving the opposite parity up to m−1. When r=n−2 this set is empty, so R_{2n−3}=\emptyset. Thus the schedule wins, and since \delta(P_n)=1, this is optimal: h(P_n)=1. ∎

Theorem 13 (k=1 classification). A graph G satisfies h(G)=1 if and only if G is a forest.
Proof. (⇒) If G contains a cycle C, then h(C)\ge \delta(C)=2; by subgraph monotonicity, h(G)\ge 2.
(⇐) Suppose G is a forest T. We build a 1-hunter schedule of length at most 2|V(T)|−1 by iteratively removing leaves. Fix a leaf \ell with neighbor u. For any X\subseteq V(T), since \ell has only neighbor u, we have \ell\notin N\big(N(X)\setminus\{u\}\big). Consider the schedule formed by two shots at u followed by the inductively constructed schedule S′ on T′:=T−\ell. Let R^T_i (resp. R^{T′}_j) denote the R-sets under these schedules. We claim by induction on j\ge 1 that R^T_{j+2} \subseteq R^{T′}_j. For j=1, R^T_2=N(V(T)\setminus\{u\})\setminus\{u\} and \ell\notin N(R^T_2), so R^T_3\subseteq V(T′)\setminus S′_1=R^{T′}_1. If R^T_{j+2}\subseteq R^{T′}_j then R^T_{j+3}=N(R^T_{j+2})\setminus S′_{j+1}\subseteq N(R^{T′}_j)\setminus S′_{j+1}=R^{T′}_{j+1}. Since S′ empties T′ after 2|V(T′)|−1 steps, we have R^T_{2+(2|V(T′)|−1)}=\emptyset, i.e., after at most 2|V(T)|−1 steps. Hence h(T)=1. ∎
