Recorded and proved core facts and new constructive tools for the hunters–rabbit evasion number. Verified schedule verification: S_1..S_t wins iff R_t=∅ with R_{i+1}=N(R_i)\S_{i+1}. Established monotonicity and bounds h(G)≤τ(G) and h(G)≥δ(G) (hence ≥ degeneracy); exact values h(K_n)=n−1 and h(K_{p,q})=min{p,q}. New lemmas: permanent blockers (h(G) ≤ |U|+h(G−U)), disjoint-union law h(G⊔H)=max, and an explicit 1-hunter forward/backward sweep on paths proving h(P_n)=1. Completed classification k=1: h(G)=1 iff G is a forest (inductive two-shot leaf removal). Cycles: explicit 2-hunter schedules found for C_5 and C_6, but a uniform proof h(C_n)=2 for all n remains open. Algorithmic consequences: fast NO/YES filters (degeneracy, ω, τ) and FVS-based n^{O(k)} recognition on graphs with small feedback vertex sets. Caution: the earlier Z-process monotonicity claim is false. See proofs.md and research notes.
