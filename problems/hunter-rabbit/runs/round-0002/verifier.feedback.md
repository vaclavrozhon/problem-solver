Strong progress this round with several rigorously provable statements and useful corrections. However, a major proposed equivalence (h(G)=degeneracy(G)) remains unproven and the provided proof is flawed. We also still lack a general n^{O(k)}-time recognition algorithm or a contrary hardness result for fixed k≥2.

Per prover assessment:
- Prover 1: The “permanent blockers” lemma is correct and valuable: fixing U every round confines the evader to G−U and yields h(G) ≤ |U|+h(G−U). Your explicit 4-round captures on C_5 and C_6 check out under the R-recursion. The separator/feedback-vertex-set program is a promising concrete FPT direction. Keep the odd-cycle analysis cautious; do not assert fixed antipodal shots on odd cycles (false), and proceed with the proposed BFS on C_7 to settle h(C_7).
- Prover 2: The disjoint-union identity h(G⊔H)=max{h(G),h(H)} is correct. Your theorem h(P_n)=1 with the 2n−3 “forward/backward sweep” and parity invariants is solid; we verified on small n and the inductive structure is sound. This is worth elevating to proofs.md. The caution on NP-membership is appropriate.
- Prover 3: The k=1 classification h(G)=1 iff G is a forest now has a correct proof. The two-shot-at-a-neighbor-of-a-leaf lemma is applied properly to establish an inductive embedding R^T_{j+2}⊆R^{T′}_j; the overall schedule length ≤2|V|−1 is explicit. This closes the k=1 case and should go to proofs.md.
- Prover 4: The Z-evolution identity R_i=V\(Z_i∪S_i) with Z_{i+1}={v: N(v)⊆Z_i∪S_i} is correct. But Z_i is not monotone in i (counterexample: P_4 with shots S_1={3}, S_2={2} gives 4∈Z_2 but 4∉Z_3). The proof of h(G)=degeneracy(G) relies on monotonicity and is invalid. Moreover, the proposed degeneracy-based schedule fails on P_4 (explicit computation yields R_4≠∅). The conjecture remains open; please either repair the argument or find a counterexample.

Concrete next steps:
1) Finalize cycles: prove h(C_n)=2 for all n≥3 or produce a counterexample (settle C_7 via exhaustive R-set BFS). 2) Leverage the forest result and Lemma A to get exact n^{O(k)} recognition on graphs with feedback vertex set ≤k−1 (enumerate U and run k=1 test). 3) Develop a DP over small separators/treewidth; formalize bag states matching R_{i+1}=N(R_i)\S_{i+1}. 4) Either prove h≤tw or pursue hardness for k=2 via layered gadgets. 5) Systematically compute h on n≤10 to stress-test the degeneracy-equality conjecture.
