We added rigor: (i) disjoint-union law h(G⊔H)=max; (ii) explicit proof that h(P_n)=1 via a 2n−3 “sweep” schedule; (iii) full k=1 classification h(G)=1 iff G is a forest with an inductive two-shot leaf argument; (iv) permanent blockers lemma h(G)≤|U|+h(G−U). Verified exact values: h(K_n)=n−1, h(K_{p,q})=min{p,q}; cycles C_5 and C_6 have 2-hunter schedules. The proposed equality h(G)=degeneracy(G) remains unproven; the given proof is flawed (Z_i not monotone; degeneracy-schedule fails on P_4). Next: settle h(C_n)=2, exploit small feedback vertex sets for n^{O(k)} recognition, and build a separator-based DP or hardness for k=2.
