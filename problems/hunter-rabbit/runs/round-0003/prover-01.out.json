  "content": "Ideas\n- Close the cycle case using the already-proved k=1 classification (h(forest)=1) and the permanent blockers lemma. This settles h(C_n) exactly and gives a clean template for many \u201calmost-acyclic\u201d graphs.\n- Extract immediate corollaries: all unicyclic graphs have h=2. Provide explicit schedules and bounds on schedule length.\n- Formalize a block-cut reduction with one permanent blocker at a cut vertex; this yields compositional upper bounds and a dynamic-programming skeleton on block\u2013cut trees.\n\nNew theorems and proofs\n- Theorem 1 (Cycles). For every n\u22653, h(C_n)=2.\n  Proof. Lower bound: \u03b4(C_n)=2 implies h(C_n)\u22652. Upper bound: Fix any vertex u of C_n and shoot u every round (permanent blocker). By the permanent blockers lemma, any surviving walk stays in C_n\u2212{u}\u2245P_{n\u22121}. Since h(P_{n\u22121})=1 (proved previously), a second hunter can run the 1-hunter path schedule on P_{n\u22121}, yielding capture. Hence h(C_n)\u22642, and equality follows.\n  Explicit schedule and length: label C_n as 1\u20132\u2013\u2026\u2013n\u20131 with 1 fixed as the blocked vertex. The second hunter plays the P_{n\u22121} sweep on 2\u20133\u2013\u2026\u2013n, e.g., shots 2,3,\u2026,n\u22121,n\u22121,n\u22122,\u2026,3 (length 2(n\u22121)\u22123=2n\u22125); the combined shots are {1,2},{1,3},\u2026,{1,n\u22121},{1,n\u22121},{1,n\u22122},\u2026,{1,3}.\n\n- Corollary 2 (Unicyclic graphs). If G is connected and has exactly one cycle, then h(G)=2.\n  Proof. G contains a cycle, so h(G)\u22652 by the k=1 classification. Pick any vertex u on the unique cycle and shoot u every round. Then G\u2212{u} is a forest, and h(G\u2212{u})=1. By the permanent blockers lemma, h(G)\u22641+h(G\u2212{u})=2.\n\n- Lemma 3 (Cut-vertex reduction). Let a be a cut vertex of G, and let the components of G\u2212a induce subgraphs H_1,\u2026,H_m with vertex sets V_i\u222a{a}. Then h(G) \u2264 1 + max_i h(H_i\u2212a).\n  Proof. Permanently shoot a. Any avoiding walk remains in G\u2212{a} and hence in some single component H_i\u2212a. The remaining hunter budget applies within that component, so one additional hunter suffices if h(H_i\u2212a)=1, more generally max_i h(H_i\u2212a) hunters suffice. Adding the permanent blocker gives the bound.\n  Remarks. This is tight on classical families: for a bouquet of t cycles meeting at a, the bound gives 1+max_i h(C_{n_i}\u2212a)=1+1=2, which equals h of the bouquet by Theorem 1 and the k=1 classification.\n\n- Lemma 4 (Disjoint union). For graphs on disjoint vertex sets, h(G \u2294 H)=max{h(G),h(H)}.\n  Proof. Lower bound by subgraph monotonicity. For the upper bound, interleave winning schedules of G and H (padding with idle shots on the other component if needed); R-evolution factorizes over components.\n\nExamples (sanity checks)\n- C_7: Using Theorem 1 with u=1 yields a 2-hunter schedule of length 9: {1,2},{1,3},{1,4},{1,5},{1,6},{1,6},{1,5},{1,4},{1,3}. Verification via the R-recursion matches the general path-sweep argument.\n- Unicyclic \u201clollipop\u201d graph: a cycle of length 5 with a long tail; h=2 by Corollary 2. A 2-hunter schedule is: block a chosen cycle vertex; with the second hunter, first clear the tail (path-sweep), then clear the cycle (path-sweep on the cycle minus the blocked vertex).\n\nAlgorithmic consequences\n- Exact recognition for k=1 is linear (acyclicity). Theorem 1 adds exact recognition on cycles and all unicyclic graphs (again linear-time by cycle detection).\n- General sufficient condition: h(G) \u2264 fvs(G)+1 (permanent blockers + h(forest)=1). Thus if fvs(G)\u2264k\u22121 we can certify YES for h(G)\u2264k in n^{O(k)} time by enumerating the \u2264n^{k\u22121} candidate blocker sets U and verifying acyclicity of G\u2212U.\n- Block\u2013cut skeleton (Lemma 3): For graphs with small \u201cinterface budget,\u201d choose a small set of permanently blocked cut vertices and solve independently in components. This yields exact algorithms on classes where components are easy (e.g., forests and cycles), producing n^{O(k)} recognition on graphs whose block\u2013cut tree can be guarded by \u2264k permanent blockers.\n\nClarifications and corrections\n- Our earlier plan to settle cycles by \u201cfixed antipodal shots\u201d is false on odd cycles; Theorem 1 uses a single permanent blocker plus a 1-hunter path sweep and works uniformly for all n.\n- The inequality h(G) \u2264 fvs(G)+1 does not imply h \u2264 tw+1, since fvs can exceed tw on disjoint unions of cycles (tw=2, fvs arbitrarily large). Hence a direct reduction from treewidth is not immediate.\n\nObstacles\n- Moving beyond unicyclic/cycle classes, cactus graphs pose a subtle scheduling issue: a single permanent blocker at one articulation confines movement locally, but cycles may attach at multiple cut vertices, so clearing one block while preventing leakage into others may require careful coordination. A global 2-hunter strategy for all cactus graphs is plausible but unproven.\n- A general n^{O(k)} algorithm remains open. The time horizon for optimal schedules is not a priori bounded by a polynomial in n for k\u22652, and the semigroup of maps R\u21a6N(R)\\S has 2^n states, making naive searches infeasible.\n\nNext steps\n1) Elevate Theorem 1 and Corollary 2 (with full proofs) into proofs.md; add explicit schedules (parameterized by n) to output.md for reproducibility.\n2) Develop a DP on block\u2013cut trees using Lemma 3: states carry (B,t), where B is the subset of cut vertices in the current fringe permanently blocked (|B|\u2264k), and t the remaining mobile hunters. For components that are cycles or trees, resolve exactly; aggregate up the tree under the budget constraint.\n3) Explore cactus graphs with 2 hunters: attempt a depth-first strategy that always blocks the parent cut vertex while using the second hunter to clear the current block (cycle becomes a path). Identify and resolve the leakage issue at child cut vertices; either produce a proof or a counterexample.\n4) Broaden sufficient conditions: if the cyclomatic number (|E|\u2212|V|+cc) \u2264 k\u22121 then fvs \u2264 k\u22121 and thus h\u2264k. Implement this polynomial-time filter and test its tightness empirically on n\u226410 to stress the degeneracy-equality conjecture.\n\nSummary\n- We proved h(C_n)=2 for all n\u22653, via a permanent blocker reducing C_n to a path and the 1-hunter path sweep. As a corollary, all unicyclic graphs have h=2. We formalized a cut-vertex reduction and reaffirmed the disjoint-union identity. These results extend exact recognition to cycles and unicyclic graphs and provide a concrete DP skeleton over block\u2013cut structures, advancing toward n^{O(k)} recognition for broader classes."
