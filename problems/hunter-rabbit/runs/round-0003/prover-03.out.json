This gives a clean, rigorous proof that h(C_n)=2 for all n\u22653.\n- Record explicit schedule lengths for cycles via reduction to paths. This also provides a template for constructing schedules on graphs with a small feedback vertex set.\n- Formalize and prove the \u201cpermanent blockers\u201d lemma (used informally before), with an inductive embedding argument on the R-recurrence.\n- Note algorithmic consequences on graphs with small feedback vertex set and propose a concrete n^{O(k)} recognition on that subclass. This provides a partial positive answer (for that family) to the main question.\n\nLemma A (Permanent blockers; formal proof)\nStatement. Let U\u2286V(G). If we shoot all vertices of U in every round, then the evader is confined to G\u2212U and the remaining hunters can execute any schedule designed for G\u2212U. Formally, if |U|+q hunters are available and there exists a winning q-hunter schedule on G\u2212U, then h(G)\u2264|U|+q. Equivalently, for any U, h(G) \u2264 |U| + h(G\u2212U).\nProof. Fix a schedule S\u2032=(S\u2032_1,\u2026,S\u2032_t) on G\u2212U with |S\u2032_i|\u2264q that wins in t rounds (R\u2032_t=\u2205 under R\u2032_{1}:=V(G\u2212U)\\S\u2032_{1}, R\u2032_{i+1}:=N_{G\u2212U}(R\u2032_i)\\S\u2032_{i+1}). Define a schedule S on G by S_i:=U\u222aS\u2032_i. Let R_1:=V(G)\\S_1 and R_{i+1}:=N_G(R_i)\\S_{i+1}. We prove by induction that for all i, (i) R_i\u2286V(G)\\U and (ii) R_i\u2286R\u2032_i. Base i=1: (i) holds since U\u2286S_1; (ii) R_1=(V(G\u2212U)\\S\u2032_1)\u222a(V(G)\\(V(G\u2212U)\u222aU\u222aS\u2032_1))=V(G\u2212U)\\S\u2032_1=R\u2032_1. Induction: assume R_i\u2286V(G\u2212U) and R_i\u2286R\u2032_i. Then N_G(R_i)=N_{G\u2212U}(R_i)\u222a(N_G(R_i)\u2229U), and since U\u2286S_{i+1}, R_{i+1}=N_G(R_i)\\(U\u222aS\u2032_{i+1})=N_{G\u2212U}(R_i)\\S\u2032_{i+1}\u2286N_{G\u2212U}(R\u2032_i)\\S\u2032_{i+1}=R\u2032_{i+1}. In particular, R_{i+1}\u2286V(G\u2212U). Thus R_t\u2286R\u2032_t=\u2205, so S wins in t rounds. \u220e\n\nTheorem B (Cycles solved). For all n\u22653, h(C_n)=2.\nProof. Lower bound: h(C_n)\u2265\u03b4(C_n)=2. Upper bound: pick any u\u2208V(C_n), let U={u}, and note C_n\u2212U\u2245P_{n\u22121}. We have h(P_{n\u22121})=1 (proved previously via the 2(n\u22121)\u22123 forward/backward sweep). By Lemma A, h(C_n)\u2264|U|+h(P_{n\u22121})=1+1=2. Hence equality holds. Moreover, an explicit winning schedule with two hunters is obtained by permanently shooting u and concurrently executing the 1-hunter path sweep on C_n\u2212u. \u220e\n\nCorollary C (Schedule length for cycles). The above construction yields a 2-hunter winning schedule on C_n of length 2(n\u22121)\u22123=2n\u22125. Concretely, label C_n so that u=1 is the permanently shot vertex and the path order on V\\{1} is 2,3,\u2026,n. Then the other hunter fires in the sequence 2,3,\u2026,n\u22121,n\u22121,n\u22122,\u2026,3, with 1 included in every shot set.\n\nRemark on verification. Under R_{1}:=V\\S_{1}, R_{i+1}:=N(R_i)\\S_{i+1}, the inductive embedding used in Lemma A gives for all i: R_i(C_n; {1}\u222a{x_1,\u2026,x_i}) \u2286 R_i(P_{n\u22121}; {x_1,\u2026,x_i}), hence emptiness transfers immediately when the path schedule finishes.\n\nProposition D (Feedback vertex set bound; explicit). Let f:=fvs(G) be the minimum size of a vertex set whose deletion makes G acyclic. Then h(G)\u2264f+1.\nProof. Let U be a minimum feedback vertex set, so G\u2212U is a forest. We have h(G\u2212U)=1 (k=1 classification). Apply Lemma A with q=1. \u220e\n\nAlgorithmic corollaries\n- Exact recognition on the subclass with fvs(G)\u2264k\u22121. Given k, decide whether h(G)\u2264k by checking if fvs(G)\u2264k\u22121 (then YES by Proposition D) or applying other filters (degeneracy>k \u21d2 NO; \u03c4(G)\u2264k \u21d2 YES). Since minimum FVS is FPT in the solution size, this yields n^{O(k)}-time recognition on that subclass.\n- Cycles and cacti. By Theorem B, all cycles have h=2. For cactus graphs, the general upper bound h\u2264fvs+1 applies; tighter exact formulas (e.g., exploiting shared blockers at articulation points) are a promising target for k=2 structure theorems.\n\nExamples (worked)\n- C_7: Permanently shoot u=1; on the path 2\u20133\u20134\u20135\u20136\u20137, fire 2,3,4,5,6,6,5,4,3 while always including 1. Length 9 = 2\u00b76\u22123. R-embedding ensures R_9=\u2205.\n- Theta graph (two terminals joined by three internally disjoint paths): fvs=2, so h\u22643; \u03b4=2 gives h\u22652. Determining whether h=2 or 3 is a concrete k=2 test case for refinement beyond Proposition D.\n\nObstacles\n- The permanent-blockers technique reduces many graphs to forests with an additive +|U|, but this may be loose when cycles share blockers. Exact characterization for broader classes (e.g., series\u2013parallel, cactus, outerplanar) remains open for k=2.\n- A general n^{O(k)} algorithm still lacks a principled bound on the number of reachable R-states from V under the transition Y\u2286N(X), |N(X)\\Y|\u2264k. Absent such a bound, NP-membership (polynomial certificate length) also remains unresolved for k\u22652.\n\nNext steps (testable)\n1) Elevate Theorem B (cycles) and Lemma A (permanent blockers) to proofs.md, with the explicit cycle schedule template and length bound 2n\u22125.\n2) Cactus graphs: attempt an exact formula for h in terms of a minimum set of articulation blockers plus local cycle patterns. Validate by exhaustive R-state search on all cactus graphs up to n\u226412.\n3) k=2 program: Enumerate minimal obstructions to h\u22642 up to n\u226410 using the state-graph BFS; check families like theta graphs and ladders to hypothesize a structural certificate for h=2.\n4) FVS-parameter DP: For given feedback set U, formalize how the single remaining hunter operates on each tree component and coordinate across U\u2019s permanent shots; optimize blockers reuse if multiple cycles share vertices (toward tighter bounds than fvs+1)."
