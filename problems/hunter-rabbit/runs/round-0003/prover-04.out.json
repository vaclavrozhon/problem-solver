This also extends to all connected unicyclic graphs: h(G)=2.\n- We formalize and prove the permanent-blockers lemma (used informally before), and re-state the disjoint-union identity with a short proof.\n- We give explicit schedules and length bounds derived from these constructions.\n\n# Formal statements and proofs\n\nLemma 1 (Permanent blockers; formal). Let G=(V,E), and let U\u2286V. Suppose a schedule (S_i) satisfies U\u2286S_i for all i. Let G\u2032:=G\u2212U, and define S\u2032_i:=S_i\\U (so |S\u2032_i|\u2264|S_i|\u2212|U|). Then for the R-recursion R^G_1:=V\\S_1, R^G_{i+1}:=N_G(R^G_i)\\S_{i+1}, and R^{G\u2032}_1:=(V\\U)\\S\u2032_1, R^{G\u2032}_{i+1}:=N_{G\u2032}(R^{G\u2032}_i)\\S\u2032_{i+1}, we have R^G_i = R^{G\u2032}_i for all i. In particular, (S_i) is winning on G iff (S\u2032_i) is winning on G\u2032. Consequently, h(G) \u2264 |U| + h(G\u2212U).\n\nProof. By induction on i. Base: R^G_1=V\\S_1=(V\\U)\\(S_1\\U)=R^{G\u2032}_1. Inductive step: assume R^G_i=R^{G\u2032}_i\u2286V\\U. Then\nR^G_{i+1}=N_G(R^G_i)\\S_{i+1}=(N_G(R^{G\u2032}_i)\\U)\\(S_{i+1}\\U)=N_{G\u2032}(R^{G\u2032}_i)\\S\u2032_{i+1}=R^{G\u2032}_{i+1}.\nThus equivalence and the bound follow. \u220e\n\nProposition 2 (Disjoint union). For graphs G,H on disjoint vertex sets, h(G\u2294H)=max{h(G),h(H)}.\n\nProof. Lower bound by subgraph monotonicity. For upper bound, interleave winning schedules on G and H: at each round shoot the k_G vertices prescribed for G and the k_H vertices for H (disjoint), using k=max(k_G,k_H) hunters (pad with arbitrary shots in the smaller component). The R-recursion factors over components, so both components are cleared by the product schedule. \u220e\n\nTheorem 3 (Cycles). For all n\u22653, h(C_n)=2.\n\nProof. Lower bound: C_n has minimum degree 2, so h(C_n)\u22652. Upper bound: fix any u\u2208V(C_n), take U={u}. Then G\u2212U\u2245P_{n\u22121}, and by the k=1 classification (forests), h(P_{n\u22121})=1. By Lemma 1, h(C_n)\u2264|U|+h(P_{n\u22121})=2. \u220e\n\nCorollary 4 (Explicit schedules and length). A 2-hunter schedule of length 2(n\u22121)\u22123=2n\u22125 captures on C_n: shoot u every round, and use the second hunter to run the standard 1-hunter sweep on the path C_n\u2212u (shots 2,3,\u2026,n\u22121,n\u22121,n\u22122,\u2026,3 in path order).\n\nTheorem 5 (Unicyclic graphs). If G is a connected unicyclic graph, then h(G)=2.\n\nProof. Lower bound: G contains C_m as a subgraph, so h(G)\u2265h(C_m)=2 by monotonicity. Upper bound: removing any vertex u on the unique cycle yields a tree; by Lemma 1 and the forest result, h(G)\u22641+1=2. \u220e\n\nRemark 6 (Multiple components). By Proposition 2, if each component is either a tree (h=1) or unicyclic (h=2), then h(G)=2 iff at least one component is unicyclic; otherwise h(G)=1.\n\n# Examples and checks\n\n- C_7: choose u=1 (shot every round). On the path 2\u20133\u20134\u20135\u20136\u20137, run the 1-hunter sweep of length 9: 2,3,4,5,6,6,5,4,3. With two hunters we shoot {1, x_t} at round t, where x_t is the path-sweep shot. By Lemma 1, this clears C_7 in 9 rounds.\n- General unicyclic: pick any vertex u on the unique cycle; same construction with the path-sweep on G\u2212u (a tree) using the second hunter.\n\n# Algorithmic consequences\n\n- k=1 in linear time (forest test) remains as in prior rounds.\n- k=2 on cycles and unicyclic graphs: polynomial-time recognition and explicit schedules (by attempting each vertex u and checking whether G\u2212u is acyclic; O(n(n+m)) naive, improvable with preprocessing).\n- Permanent blockers yield immediate YES-certificates: if fvs(G)\u2264k\u22121 then h(G)\u2264k. This covers, e.g., cactus graphs with a bounded number of cycles (we will pursue exact classification next).\n\n# Obstacles and cautions\n\n- The Z-process identity R_i = V \\ (Z_i \u222a S_i) with Z_{i+1}={v: N(v)\u2286Z_i\u222aS_i} is correct, but Z_i need not be monotone in i; peeling arguments that rely on permanence without further structure fail. Our proofs above avoid any Z-monotonicity.\n- A general n^{O(k)} recognition algorithm is still open. The permanent-blockers approach yields strong sufficient conditions but not necessary ones in general.\n\n# Next steps\n\n1) Cactus graphs (each edge in at most one cycle): attempt to prove h(G)\u22642, by phase-wise blocking of a cut vertex adjacent to a cycle and sweeping attached trees, then moving along the block\u2013cut tree; formalize \u201cbarrier at a cut vertex\u201d lemmas under the R-recursion.\n2) Feedback vertex set parameterization: for fixed f=|U|, develop a DP that, given U, decides the minimum additional hunters x needed to clear G with per-round shots limited to f+x, explicitly modeling parity constraints at attachments between U and forest components. Target running time n\u00b7poly(n)\u00b7c^f.\n3) Stress-test degeneracy-equality on small graphs (n\u226410) computationally; seek counterexamples with degeneracy 2 but suspected h\u22653.\n4) Schedule-length bounds: quantify T_k(G)=minimum capture time with k=h(G) hunters on classes (cycles, unicyclic, cactus). For cycles we have T_2(C_n)\u22642n\u22125; find asymptotic improvements or lower bounds.\n\n# Summary for inclusion\n\n- Lemma 1 (Permanent blockers) with proof; corollary h(G) \u2264 |U|+h(G\u2212U).\n- Proposition 2 (Disjoint union) with proof.\n- Theorem 3: h(C_n)=2 for all n\u22653; proof via blocking one vertex and applying h(P_{n\u22121})=1; explicit O(n)\u2013length schedules.\n- Theorem 5: If G is connected unicyclic then h(G)=2. Extension to arbitrary disjoint unions via Proposition 2.\n- Algorithmic corollaries: polynomial recognition and schedule construction for cycles/unicyclic graphs; YES-certificates via small feedback vertex sets. Open: general n^{O(k)} recognition; proposed DP paths on cactus/FVS-parameterized families.\n"
