=== SYSTEM ===
You are a research mathematician. 

You are being run in a loop with a verifier that checks rigor. Your goal is to make **incremental, auditable progress**. You are not expected to solve the problem at once, but to generate new, testable ideas.

Inputs: 
- task statement 
- notes.md (informal progress & exploratory work; optional) 
- proofs.md (rigorously proven results & detailed proofs; optional) 
- output.md (main results, rigorously presented; optional) 
- summary of past rounds (optional) 
- possibly some reference papers.

What counts as progress:
- Extract lemmas/heuristics from literature. Generalize them for current task, or explain why they could be helpful. 
- Explore small examples & try to break your own claims with toy counterexamples.
- Prove special cases or nontrivial bounds.
- If an approach fails, explain crisply why.
- Point out flaws in notes.md, proofs.md, or output.md (you are not rewriting these files yourself, that's verifier's job).

**Discipline.** 
- Read notes, outputs, summaries carefully before proposing new work. 
- Reference papers if relevant, but focus on *incremental, checkable steps*. 
- Do not output Markdown code fences, only raw JSON. 
- Length: at least ~200 words. 
- Organize your reasoning with short headings (Ideas, Examples, Obstacles, Next steps), make clear what your claims are and how they are supported. 

**Output**: Write your analysis as Markdown that includes both informal reasoning and any rigorous proofs. The verifier will decide what goes into notes.md, proofs.md, and output.md.

**Return strictly JSON**:
{
  "content": "Your complete analysis in Markdown (KaTeX allowed). Include reasoning, examples, proofs, failed attempts, intuitions - everything for the verifier to review."

Definitions.
• The hunters and rabbit problem is a pursuit-evasion game played
on an undirected graph. A strategy for k hunters is a sequence
s1, s2, · · · , sn of subsets of k vertices. A strategy is winning if, for
every walk v1, v2, · · · , vn in the graph (not necessarily simple), there
is i such that vi ∈ si. Intuitively, the evader is walking on the graph
(it has to move at each turn by following exactly one edge) and must
avoid the k vertices that the pursuers examine at each time step.

• The evasion number of a graph G is the smallest k for which there
is a winning strategy with k hunters.

Question: Is it the case that, for any constant k , we can recognize
the graphs of the evasion number k in polynomial time? (E.g. n^{O(k)})

Working definitions and dynamics
- We fix the open-neighborhood operator N(X)=⋃_{x∈X}N(x). For a schedule S_1, …, S_t (|S_i|≤k), define R_1:=V\S_1 and R_{i+1}:=N(R_i)\S_{i+1}. The schedule is winning up to horizon t iff R_t=∅. Equivalently, using P_1:=V and P_{i+1}:=N(P_i\S_i), the schedule wins iff P_{t+1}=∅. These are equivalent formulations under an index shift.

Verified results we will use
- Subgraph monotonicity: If H⊆G then h(H)≤h(G).
- Upper bound: h(G)≤τ(G) by shooting a minimum vertex cover twice (capture by time 2).
- Lower bounds: h(G)≥δ(G); therefore h(G)≥degeneracy(G). Also, if G contains K_{s,t} as a subgraph then h(G)≥min{s,t}.
- Exact values: h(K_n)=n−1; h(K_{p,q})=min{p,q}. For cycles, h(C_3)=2 (clique), h(C_4)=2; for C_5 a concrete 4-round schedule with k=2 succeeds (see proofs.md). The claim that two fixed antipodal shots per round win on all cycles is false for odd n.

Corrections to earlier claims
- The statement h(K_n)=n is incorrect; n−1 hunters suffice (and are necessary by δ(K_n)=n−1).
- The 1-hunter impossibility on P_n for n≥4 is false; e.g., P_4 has an explicit 1-hunter winning schedule. A general proof that h(P_n)=1 appears feasible but is not yet written.
- The assertion that the decision problem is in NP lacks a bound on schedule length; a priori, a winning schedule may require exponentially many rounds.

Concrete example (cycles)
- C_5 with k=2: S_1={1,3}, S_2={4,5}, S_3={2,4}, S_4={1,4} yields R_1={2,4,5}, R_2={1,3}, R_3={5}, R_4=∅. Thus h(C_5)≤2. For odd cycles, fixed pairs per round do not suffice; schedules must change over time.

Algorithmic consequences (current)
- Fast NO: if degeneracy(G)>k or ω(G)≥k+2 then h(G)>k.
- Fast YES: if τ(G)≤k then h(G)≤k (via FPT vertex-cover).
- These give n^{O(k)} filters but do not settle all instances.

Open targets and next steps
1) Prove h(C_n)=2 for all n≥3 (and record a general schedule). 2) Settle k=1: prove or refute “h(G)=1 iff G is a forest.” 3) Investigate structural upper bounds: does h(G)≤tw(G)? A positive answer implies polynomial recognition for fixed k. 4) Design a separator-based DP that simulates R-evolution with states depending only on boundary sets of size ≤k. 5) Empirically compute h on small graphs (n≤10) and all trees up to n≈12 to test the degeneracy-equality conjecture and discover obstructions.

New validated tools and results
- Permanent blockers. If U⊆V is shot every round, any avoiding walk stays in G−U, hence h(G) ≤ |U|+h(G−U). This enables reductions via feedback vertex sets and other separators.
- Disjoint unions. For graphs on disjoint vertex sets, h(G ⊔ H)=max{h(G),h(H)}. A concatenation of winning schedules for components suffices.
- Paths. A 1-hunter “forward/backward sweep” of length 2n−3 (shots 1,2,…,n−1,n−1,n−2,…,2) wins on P_n; a parity-invariant proof verifies R_{2n−3}=∅.
- k=1 classification. h(G)=1 iff G is a forest. Proof: cycles force ≥2 by δ=2; for forests, an inductive schedule repeatedly shoots a neighbor u of a leaf ℓ twice, then recurses on T−ℓ. A key fact: for any X and leaf ℓ with neighbor u, ℓ∉N(N(X)\{u}). This ensures ℓ never reappears in R after the double-shot.
- Cycles. Explicit 2-hunter captures verified on C_5 and C_6; odd cycles require time-varying shots. A uniform proof h(C_n)=2 for all n remains open.

Corrections and cautions
- The “Z-process” identity R_i=V\(Z_i∪S_i) with Z_{i+1}={v:N(v)⊆Z_i∪S_i} holds, but Z_i need not be monotone. Arguments relying on Z-monotonicity (e.g., h=degeneracy proof) are invalid.

Algorithmic implications (current)
- Exact k=1 recognition in linear time via acyclicity. For general k, fast filters: if degeneracy(G)>k (or ω(G)≥k+2), then NO; if τ(G)≤k, then YES (2-round capture using a vertex cover).
- Permanent blockers yield: if fvs(G)≤k−1 and h(forest)=1 (proved), then h(G)≤k, giving an n^{O(k)} recognition on that subclass by enumerating U (|U|≤k−1).

Next steps
1) Settle cycles: prove h(C_n)=2 for all n (start with exhaustive R-set BFS on C_7). 2) Formalize a separator-based DP that simulates R_{i+1}=N(R_i)\S_{i+1} across small boundaries (treewidth/FVS). 3) Evaluate the degeneracy-equality conjecture empirically on n≤10 and either prove or refute it. 4) Pursue either h≤tw (positive algorithmic route) or hardness for k=2 (layered gadgets) as a decisive direction on the main question.

# Main Results




=== Round 1 Summary ===

Recorded and verified core definitions and elementary bounds for the hunters–rabbit evasion number h(G). Proved schedule verification equivalence (S_1..S_t wins iff R_t=∅ with R_{i+1}=N(R_i)\S_{i+1}), subgraph monotonicity, lower bounds h(G)≥δ(G) and hence ≥ degeneracy(G), and the upper bound h(G)≤τ(G) (capture by shooting a minimum vertex cover twice). Determined exact values h(K_n)=n−1 and h(K_{p,q})=min{p,q}; cycles: C_3,C_4 have h=2 and an explicit 4-round 2-hunter schedule shows h(C_5)≤2 (odd cycles require time-varying schedules). Algorithmically: fast NO filters (degeneracy>k or ω(G)≥k+2) and fast YES via τ(G)≤k, but NP-membership is unresolved because winning schedules may need unbounded length. Open targets: prove h(C_n)=2, classify h(G)=1, and investigate h(G)≤tw(G) or an n^{O(k)} separator DP. Citations: proofs.md; research notes.


=== Round 2 Summary ===

Recorded and proved core facts and new constructive tools for the hunters–rabbit evasion number. Verified schedule verification: S_1..S_t wins iff R_t=∅ with R_{i+1}=N(R_i)\S_{i+1}. Established monotonicity and bounds h(G)≤τ(G) and h(G)≥δ(G) (hence ≥ degeneracy); exact values h(K_n)=n−1 and h(K_{p,q})=min{p,q}. New lemmas: permanent blockers (h(G) ≤ |U|+h(G−U)), disjoint-union law h(G⊔H)=max, and an explicit 1-hunter forward/backward sweep on paths proving h(P_n)=1. Completed classification k=1: h(G)=1 iff G is a forest (inductive two-shot leaf removal). Cycles: explicit 2-hunter schedules found for C_5 and C_6, but a uniform proof h(C_n)=2 for all n remains open. Algorithmic consequences: fast NO/YES filters (degeneracy, ω, τ) and FVS-based n^{O(k)} recognition on graphs with small feedback vertex sets. Caution: the earlier Z-process monotonicity claim is false. See proofs.md and research notes.


=== Previous Round Feedback ===

Strong progress this round with several rigorously provable statements and useful corrections. However, a major proposed equivalence (h(G)=degeneracy(G)) remains unproven and the provided proof is flawed. We also still lack a general n^{O(k)}-time recognition algorithm or a contrary hardness result for fixed k≥2.

Per prover assessment:
- Prover 1: The “permanent blockers” lemma is correct and valuable: fixing U every round confines the evader to G−U and yields h(G) ≤ |U|+h(G−U). Your explicit 4-round captures on C_5 and C_6 check out under the R-recursion. The separator/feedback-vertex-set program is a promising concrete FPT direction. Keep the odd-cycle analysis cautious; do not assert fixed antipodal shots on odd cycles (false), and proceed with the proposed BFS on C_7 to settle h(C_7).
- Prover 2: The disjoint-union identity h(G⊔H)=max{h(G),h(H)} is correct. Your theorem h(P_n)=1 with the 2n−3 “forward/backward sweep” and parity invariants is solid; we verified on small n and the inductive structure is sound. This is worth elevating to proofs.md. The caution on NP-membership is appropriate.
- Prover 3: The k=1 classification h(G)=1 iff G is a forest now has a correct proof. The two-shot-at-a-neighbor-of-a-leaf lemma is applied properly to establish an inductive embedding R^T_{j+2}⊆R^{T′}_j; the overall schedule length ≤2|V|−1 is explicit. This closes the k=1 case and should go to proofs.md.
- Prover 4: The Z-evolution identity R_i=V\(Z_i∪S_i) with Z_{i+1}={v: N(v)⊆Z_i∪S_i} is correct. But Z_i is not monotone in i (counterexample: P_4 with shots S_1={3}, S_2={2} gives 4∈Z_2 but 4∉Z_3). The proof of h(G)=degeneracy(G) relies on monotonicity and is invalid. Moreover, the proposed degeneracy-based schedule fails on P_4 (explicit computation yields R_4≠∅). The conjecture remains open; please either repair the argument or find a counterexample.

Concrete next steps:
1) Finalize cycles: prove h(C_n)=2 for all n≥3 or produce a counterexample (settle C_7 via exhaustive R-set BFS). 2) Leverage the forest result and Lemma A to get exact n^{O(k)} recognition on graphs with feedback vertex set ≤k−1 (enumerate U and run k=1 test). 3) Develop a DP over small separators/treewidth; formalize bag states matching R_{i+1}=N(R_i)\S_{i+1}. 4) Either prove h≤tw or pursue hardness for k=2 via layered gadgets. 5) Systematically compute h on n≤10 to stress-test the degeneracy-equality conjecture.
