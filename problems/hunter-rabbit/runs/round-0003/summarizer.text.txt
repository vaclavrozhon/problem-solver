{"summary_md":"This round proved and formalized several structural and algorithmic facts about the hunters–rabbit evasion number h(G). Key verification tool: R_1=V\\S_1 and R_{i+1}=N(R_i)\\S_{i+1} and S wins iff R_t=∅. New/verified lemmas: permanent blockers (h(G) ≤ |U|+h(G−U)), disjoint-union law h(G⊔H)=max{h(G),h(H)}, and separator composition bounds. Constructive results: an explicit 1‑hunter forward/backward sweep proves h(P_n)=1 and yields the classification h(G)=1 iff G is a forest (leaf double‑shot induction). Using a permanent blocker plus the path sweep we proved h(C_n)=2 for all n and hence h(G)=2 for all unicyclic graphs. Algorithmically, h(G) ≤ fvs(G)+1 (block feedback vertices), giving an n^{O(k)} YES-recognizer when fvs ≤ k−1; fast NO/YES filters via degeneracy, clique number, and vertex-cover also recorded. Cautions: the Z-process is not monotone and minor‑monotonicity of {h≤k} is unresolved.
