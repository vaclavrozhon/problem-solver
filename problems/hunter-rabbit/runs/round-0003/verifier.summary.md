We confirmed and formalized: permanent blockers; h(G⊔H)=max; h(P_n)=1; k=1 classification (forests); h(C_n)=2 for all n via blocking + path sweep; unicyclic graphs have h=2; and a cut-vertex reduction h(G) ≤ 1 + max h(component). We cautioned that tree schedule-length bounds beyond 2|V|−1 are unproven. Algorithmically, we now have an n^{O(k)} YES recognizer for fvs ≤ k−1 and a clear DP path along block–cut trees. Open: cactus graphs for k=2, Pre_k compression, and a general n^{O(k)} algorithm or hardness for fixed k≥2.
