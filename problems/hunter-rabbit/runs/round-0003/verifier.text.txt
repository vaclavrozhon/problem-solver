{"feedback_md":"Good progress: several claims can now be considered settled and promotable to proofs.md. Specifically, cycles are resolved (h(C_n)=2) via the permanent-blocker lemma plus the k=1 forest classification; unicyclic graphs consequently have h=2; disjoint unions behave as h(⊔)=max; and a clean cut-vertex reduction follows from permanent blockers + disjoint union. These are consistent with the R-recursion and with our earlier path result h(P_n)=1.\n\nTargeted critiques and fixes:\n- Prover 1: The cycle proof via a permanent blocker plus the path sweep is correct. The cut-vertex lemma h(G) ≤ 1 + max_i h(component) is right (formally: block the cut vertex; h on the disjoint union of components is the max). Avoid embedding extra schedule-length claims in formal statements; keep them in notes unless proven for all trees. The block–cut DP idea is promising; specify states and transitions next.\n- Prover 2: The cycle theorem is correct. The FVS bound h(G) ≤ fvs(G)+1 with an explicit constructive schedule is sound; however, your length bound (2|V\\F|−3·cc + 1) is not yet justified for arbitrary trees (we only proved a 2|T|−1 bound for trees, and 2|T|−3 for paths). Please either prove the stronger bound for trees or state the weaker bound formally. The Pre_k fixpoint is a useful exact characterization; keep it in notes until a compressed representation is proved.\n- Prover 3: Excellent: permanent-blockers lemma is now fully formal, and the cycle theorem leverages the k=1 classification rigorously. Keep explicit schedule templates in notes, not in proofs, unless fully parameterized and checked.\n- Prover 4: The formalizations this round align with the accepted arguments; crucially, you no longer rely on the (false) monotonicity of the Z-process. The unicyclic theorem is correct as stated.\n\nNext steps:\n1) Implement and analyze an n^{O(k)} recognizer on graphs with fvs ≤ k−1 (enumerate U, block U, and run the 1-hunter forest schedule). 2) Formalize a block–cut DP with permanent blockers on chosen cut vertices and exact solvers on tree/cycle blocks. 3) Tackle cactus graphs for k=2 (prove h(G)=2 or find counterexamples). 4) Explore separator-based DP toward general n^{O(k)} or prove hardness for k=2. 5) Validate Pre_k compression for k=2 by bounding the number of distinct relevant neighborhoods.","summary_md":"We confirmed and formalized: permanent blockers; h(G⊔H)=max; h(P_n)=1; k=1 classification (forests); h(C_n)=2 for all n via blocking + path sweep; unicyclic graphs have h=2; and a cut-vertex reduction h(G) ≤ 1 + max h(component).

Proof: Permanently shoot one vertex u (anchor); the evader is confined to C_n−u ≅ P_{n−1}, where a 1-hunter sweep wins. Explicit 2-hunter schedule length 2n−5 follows from the path sweep template.\n- Unicyclic graphs: If G is connected with exactly one cycle, then h(G)=2. Anchor any cycle vertex; G−{u} is a tree (h=1) and permanent blockers add +1.\n- Cut-vertex reduction: If a is a cut vertex of G and C_1,…,C_m are the components of G−a, then h(G) ≤ 1 + max_i h(C_i). Reason: block a, then use that h on a disjoint union is the max over components.\n- Disjoint unions: h(G ⊔ H)=max{h(G),h(H)} (components decouple under R-evolution).\n- FVS bound (constructive): h(G) ≤ fvs(G)+1 by blocking a feedback vertex set and sweeping each tree component.

For the upper bound, choose any u∈V(C_n) and shoot u every round. By the permanent blockers lemma (h(G) ≤ |U|+h(G−U)), any avoiding walk stays in C_n−{u}≅P_{n−1}. Since h(P_{n−1})=1, one additional hunter can execute a winning 1-hunter path schedule on C_{n}−{u}, giving a 2-hunter winning schedule on C_n. Hence h(C_n)=2. ∎\n\nCorollary (Unicyclic graphs). If G is connected and has exactly one cycle, then h(G)=2.\nProof. Lower bound: G contains a cycle, so h(G)≥2 by subgraph monotonicity and the previous theorem. For the upper bound, pick a vertex u on the cycle and shoot u every round. Then G−{u} is a tree; since h(G−{u})=1 (k=1 classification), the permanent blockers lemma yields h(G)≤1+1=2. ∎\n\nLemma (Cut-vertex reduction). Let a be a cut vertex of G, and let C_1,…,C_m be the vertex sets of the components of G−a. Then h(G) ≤ 1 + max_{i} h(G[C_i]).\nProof. Permanently shoot a. Any avoiding walk remains in G−a and thus in some component G[C_i]. By the disjoint union law h(⊔_i G[C_i])=max_i h(G[C_i]), it follows that with q:=max_i h(G[C_i]) hunters we can win on G−a. Adding the permanent blocker a gives a schedule with 1+q hunters on G. ∎"},"output_update":null}
