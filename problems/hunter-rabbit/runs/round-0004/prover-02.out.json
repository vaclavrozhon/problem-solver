  "content": "Ideas\n\n- Add two general tools: a vertex-expansion lower bound and a periodic-schedule criterion via a time-lift. Both are broadly applicable, easy to verify, and sharpen our understanding of obstructions and of schedule structure.\n- Consolidate \u201canchoring + sweep\u201d consequences: unicyclic graphs have h=2; separators/cut vertices compose cleanly; feedback-vertex-set bound is constructive.\n- Outline an n^{O(k)} YES-procedure on fvs \u2264 k\u22121 and suggest DP directions for small separators.\n\nRigorous results and proofs\n\nProposition 1 (Vertex-expansion lower bound). Let\n\u03b9(G) := min_{\u2205\u2260X\u2286V} (|N(X)| \u2212 |X|).\nIf \u03b9(G) \u2265 k, then h(G) \u2265 k+1.\nProof. Consider any k-hunter schedule (S_i). Let R_1 := V\\S_1; if R_1 = \u2205 we already have k \u2265 n, trivial. For any nonempty R_i, the update gives |R_{i+1}| = |N(R_i) \\ S_{i+1}| \u2265 |N(R_i)| \u2212 |S_{i+1}| \u2265 (|R_i|+k) \u2212 k = |R_i|. Thus nonempty sets stay nondecreasing in size. Since R_1 is nonempty unless S_1=V, R_t cannot become empty. Hence no k-schedule wins; h(G) \u2265 k+1.\nRemarks. This strictly strengthens the minimum-degree bound h(G) \u2265 \u03b4(G) (take X of size 1). It captures genuine expansion and is tight on K_{p,q} (\u03b9 = min{p,q}\u22121; h = min{p,q}).\n\nLemma 2 (Periodic schedules via time-lift). Fix p \u2265 1 and a sequence (S_1,\u2026,S_p) with |S_i| \u2264 k; extend it periodically S_{i+p}=S_i. Build the directed time-lift L_p with vertex set V\u00d7[p] and arcs (u,i)\u2192(v,i+1 mod p) whenever uv\u2208E. Delete the nodes (v,i) with v\u2208S_i. Then the periodic schedule is winning iff the resulting digraph is acyclic. Moreover, if acyclic, capture occurs within T \u2264 p\u00b7|V| rounds.\nProof. A surviving infinite walk v_1,v_2,\u2026 avoiding shots corresponds to an infinite directed path in L_p, which must contain a directed cycle by finiteness; conversely, a directed cycle in L_p projects to a length-p\u00b7r periodic walk in G that avoids shots. If acyclic, longest paths in L_p have length < |V|\u00b7p; hence after at most p\u00b7|V| rounds no avoiding path of that length exists, so R_T=\u2205.\n\nProposition 3 (Unicyclic graphs). If G is connected with exactly one cycle, then h(G)=2.\nProof. Lower bound: G contains a cycle as a subgraph, so h(G) \u2265 2. Upper bound: pick any cycle vertex u and shoot u every round (permanent blocker). Then G\u2212{u} is a forest, and by the k=1 classification (forest case) one hunter wins there; using two hunters, play S_i={u}\u222a{x_i}, where x_i are the 1-hunter shots for G\u2212{u}. This confines the rabbit to G\u2212{u} and captures it.\n\nLemma 4 (Separator composition). Let V=U\u2294W\u2294S with no edges between U and W. Then h(G) \u2264 |S| + max{h(G[U\u222aS]), h(G[W\u222aS])}. In particular, if we shoot S every round, the evader cannot traverse between U and W, and the subgames decouple.\nProof. Use |S| hunters to shoot S every round. The remaining \u2264 k\u2212|S| hunters simulate a winning schedule on one side while the other side plays empty shots; then switch sides. Any evading walk stays on one side throughout, hence is caught in its side\u2019s phase.\n\nCorollary 5 (FVS bound; constructive). For any feedback vertex set F, h(G) \u2264 |F|+1. A winning schedule is obtained by shooting F every round and running the 1-hunter forest schedule on G\u2212F component by component (disjoint-union law).\n\nConsequences and examples\n\n- Cycles solved (reprise). The \u201canchor + sweep\u201d method (permanently shoot one vertex u on C_n) reduces to P_{n\u22121}, where a 1-hunter forward/backward sweep wins, giving h(C_n)=2 and a schedule of length 2n\u22125.\n- Cacti and beyond. Proposition 3 implies all unicyclic graphs have h=2. For general cacti, FVS(G) can be >1 (e.g., two vertex-disjoint cycles); the bound h(G) \u2264 fvs(G)+1 applies. Whether h(G)=2 for all cacti remains open; anchor-relocation is nontrivial in our \u201cephemeral shot\u201d model.\n- Expansion bound in action. If every nonempty X satisfies |N(X)| \u2265 |X|+2, then h(G) \u2265 3. This gives strong NO-certificates on vertex expanders and random d-regular graphs where Hall-type expansion holds.\n\nAlgorithmic implications\n\n- Periodic schedules: Given p and k, testing whether a fixed (S_1,\u2026,S_p) wins is O(p\u00b7m) via acyclicity in L_p. Searching over choices is n^{O(pk)}, so if a priori p \u2264 f(k), this yields an n^{O(k)} algorithm. Establishing such a bound on p (or proving its nonexistence) becomes a concrete target.\n- Small-FVS subclass: If fvs(G) \u2264 k\u22121, we can certify YES by guessing F (O(n^{k\u22121})), checking G\u2212F is a forest, and emitting the explicit |F|+1 schedule (Lemma 4 + Corollary 5). This is an n^{O(k)} recognizer on that subclass.\n- Separator DPs: Lemma 4 suggests a DP over a block\u2013cut tree or a tree decomposition: for a separator S, spend |S| permanent blockers and solve subinstances independently with the residual budget. Making this exact for general k requires careful accounting of when permanent blockers can be reused; for bounded treewidth, we aim for n\u00b7f(t,k) time.\n\nObstacles and cautions\n\n- Anchor relocation with two hunters is delicate: unlike stationary searchers, shots are instantaneous; moving a permanent blocker across a cut risks letting the rabbit slip through. This is the main hurdle in extending unicyclic\u21d22 to all cactus graphs.\n- The expansion bound is powerful but computing \u03b9(G) is hard in general; as a NO-filter it is most useful on families with certifiable expansion.\n- NP-membership remains unsettled: without a priori bounds on schedule length (or period), certificates can be super-polynomial.\n\nNext steps (auditable)\n\n1) Period-bounded schedules. Attempt to bound the period p by a function of k (start with k=1,2). If successful, this gives n^{O(k)} recognition via Lemma 2. Fallback: show hardness of finding a period-p schedule for small p.\n2) Cactus graphs with two disjoint cycles. Either construct a 2-hunter schedule (anchor-sharing strategy) or produce a counterexample. Begin with two C_5\u2019s connected by a length-2 path; attempt formal R-evolution adversary for any 2-shot schedule.\n3) Separator DP prototype. Implement a DP on block\u2013cut trees that assigns permanent blockers to selected cut vertices and uses known exact solvers on pieces (trees, cycles, unicyclic). Analyze its approximation guarantees versus fvs+1.\n4) Empirical expansion tests. For small n, compute minimal \u03b9(G) and compare to h(G) to assess tightness and to design faster NO-filters.\n\nSummary\n\n- New tools: a vertex-expansion lower bound (\u03b9(G)\u2265k \u21d2 h\u2265k+1) and a periodic-schedule criterion via a time-lift (acyclicity \u21d2 finite capture horizon \u2264 p\u00b7n).\n- Solidified \u201canchor + sweep\u201d consequences: cycles (h=2) and unicyclic graphs (h=2); separator composition and FVS-based constructive schedules.\n- Provided concrete algorithmic avenues: period-bounded searches, small-FVS n^{O(k)} YES-recognition, and separator-based DPs. These are immediately checkable and extend our toolkit toward the main recognizability question."
