# Ideas
- Extend the permanent-blockers method to block–cut decompositions. Use 2 hunters in phases that permanently eliminate a leaf block from the block–cut tree, thereby shrinking the graph irrespective of the rabbit’s starting location.
- Prove that on cactus graphs (each edge in at most one cycle) every leaf block (either an edge or a cycle) can be eliminated by a 2-hunter phase. Inductively this yields h(G)=2 for all connected cacti with a cycle (trees already have h=1).
- Provide explicit schedule templates and length bounds for each phase. Conclude polynomial-time recognition and construction on cacti.

# Tools (recap)
- R-dynamics: R_1=V\S_1; R_{i+1}=N(R_i)\S_{i+1}. A schedule wins by time t iff R_t=∅.
- Permanent blockers (proved): If U⊆S_i for all i, then the evolution equals that on G−U with shots S_i\U. In particular h(G) ≤ |U|+h(G−U).
- Forests: h(T)=1 for any tree T (proved earlier), with an explicit 1-hunter sweep.
- Disjoint unions: h(G⊔H)=max{h(G),h(H)}.

# Block–cut structure preliminaries
Let G be connected. The block–cut tree BCT(G) is a bipartite tree whose nodes are blocks (maximal 2-connected subgraphs) and cut vertices; edges indicate incidence. For cactus graphs, every block is either a cycle or a single edge K_2.

We call a block node X in BCT(G) a leaf block if it has degree 1 in BCT(G).

# Lemmas (formal)

Lemma 1 (Eliminating a pendant tree branch). Let G be any graph, v∈V, and let H be the connected component of G−v that is a tree (possibly a single edge K_2) and is attached to v (i.e., all edges from H to G−H go to v). Then with 2 hunters there is a finite schedule segment that maps any R (set of possible positions at segment start) to R′ with R′∩(H\{v})=∅, while using one hunter permanently on v during the segment.

Proof. Keep v in every shot (permanent blocker U={v}). Then the evader cannot cross between H\{v} and G−H. Inside H, we have a tree; with the second hunter, run the known 1-hunter sweep on H\{v} (a tree or empty). By the permanent-blockers lemma, the evolution on H\{v} decouples and is exactly the 1-hunter evolution there, which ends with no possible positions in H\{v}. Since v is shot each round, R never contains v during the segment. Hence R′∩(H\{v})=∅. ∎

Lemma 2 (Eliminating a leaf cycle block). Let G be a cactus graph, and let B be a cycle block which is a leaf in BCT(G), attached to the rest of G only at a cut vertex a∈V(B). Then with 2 hunters there is a finite schedule segment that maps any starting R to R′ with R′∩(B\{a})=∅, using one hunter permanently on a during the segment.

Proof. Keep a in every shot during the segment. Then no walk can cross between B\{a} and G−B via a, and within B the removal of a turns the cycle B into the path P:=B−a. Using the second hunter, execute the 1-hunter path sweep on P. By the permanent-blockers lemma, the evolution on P is independent and ends with no possible positions in P; also a is shot and thus never in R. Therefore R′∩(B\{a})=∅. ∎

Remark. In Lemma 2 we did not require any assumption on the rest of G; whether the rabbit starts in B or outside it, after the segment it cannot be in B\{a}.

# Main theorem for cactus graphs

Theorem 3. If G is a connected cactus graph, then h(G)=1 if G is a tree, and h(G)=2 otherwise.

Proof. If G is a tree, h(G)=1 is known. Suppose G contains at least one cycle. Lower bound h(G)≥2 follows from δ(G)≥2 on any cycle subgraph.

For the upper bound, proceed inductively on the number c of cycle blocks in BCT(G). If c=1, G is unicyclic and h(G)=2 was already proved (anchor the unique cycle vertex a and sweep the tree G−a).

Assume c≥2. Consider BCT(G) and pick a leaf block X. Two cases.
- X is an edge block K_2 with a leaf endpoint x attached only to a cut vertex v. Apply Lemma 1 to eliminate the pendant tree H containing x with anchor v. This yields a schedule segment that maps any R to R′ with R′∩(H\{v})=∅. The effect is to delete H\{v} from future consideration. The remaining graph’s block–cut tree is obtained by pruning a leaf edge; c does not increase, and the process can be repeated.
- X is a cycle block B attached only at a cut vertex a. Apply Lemma 2 to eliminate B\{a}. This prunes one cycle block from BCT(G), reducing c by 1.

Iterating these pruning segments (each using at most 2 hunters and anchored at the relevant cut vertex), we eventually remove all cycle blocks (since BCT(G) is finite and each cycle-pruning strictly decreases c). The residual graph is a tree; finish with a 1-hunter sweep (we may ignore the second hunter). Concatenating the segments gives a finite 2-hunter schedule with R_t=∅ at the end. Hence h(G)≤2.
Combining with the lower bound h(G)≥2 (because G has a cycle) yields h(G)=2. ∎

Corollary 4 (Disconnected cacti). If G is a disjoint union of cactus components G_i, then h(G)=max_i h(G_i) by the disjoint-union law; in particular, h(G)=2 iff at least one component contains a cycle.

# Explicit schedule lengths
- In Lemma 1, the pendant tree branch on m vertices is cleared by the 1-hunter tree schedule in ≤2m−1 rounds while anchoring v, so the segment length is O(m).
- In Lemma 2, if the leaf cycle block B has length ℓ, then the path P=B−a has length ℓ−1 and the standard 1-hunter sweep on a path takes 2(ℓ−1)−3=2ℓ−5 rounds while anchoring a. Summing over pruned blocks plus a final ≤2|V(T)|−1 rounds on the residual tree T gives an overall O(n)-round schedule (explicit but not needed for recognition).

# Examples
- Sunlet graph (cycle with a pendant edge attached to each cycle vertex): Its block–cut tree has the cycle block of degree ≥2 and many leaf edge blocks. Repeatedly apply Lemma 1 to prune pendant edges until the cycle becomes a leaf block; then apply Lemma 2; hence h=2.
- A chain of cycles connected by paths (a cactus): prune pendant tree edges along the chain until an end cycle becomes a leaf block, eliminate it, and continue inward; h=2.

# Algorithmic consequences
- Recognition on cacti: Given G, test if it is a cactus (linear-time via checking each edge lies in ≤1 cycle and computing BCT). If acyclic, output h=1; else h=2. Constructing an explicit 2-hunter schedule follows the proof: iteratively identify a leaf block and emit the corresponding anchored segment.
- More generally, for graphs with small feedback vertex set f, the constructive bound h(G) ≤ f+1 holds; on cacti f can be as small as 1 even with many cycles, and equality h=2 is achieved whenever a cycle exists.

# Obstacles
- Extending from cacti to all outerplanar graphs: cycle blocks in outerplanar graphs include series–parallel 2-connected pieces beyond single cycles; our leaf-block elimination requires a 1-hunter capture inside a block with one anchor, which fails for general 2-connected outerplanar blocks. New intra-block strategies or additional invariants are needed.
- General n^{O(k)} recognition remains open beyond the classes handled (forests, unicyclic, cactus, small-FVS). A DP over tree decompositions needs a compact boundary-state representation of the reachability set R under the Pre_k operator; establishing a polynomially bounded state space for fixed k is the key hurdle.

# Next steps
- Outerplanar graphs with k=2: attempt a block-level version of Lemma 2 for series–parallel blocks using one anchor to reduce to a forest inside the block, or prove a counterexample.
- FVS-parameter DP: given a feedback vertex set U, design a DP that alternates anchoring at u∈U and sweeping attached forest components, optimizing the number of concurrently anchored vertices to minimize k. Target exact computation of h(G) in time poly(n)·c^{|U|}.
- Hardness for k=2: formalize the time-expanded layering reduction to a per-layer budgeted path hitting problem; attempt reductions from NP-hard “layered cut” variants to show hardness or to derive integrality gaps for the natural LP.
- Periodic schedules: investigate whether for fixed k there exists a universal polynomial bound on the period p of a winning periodic schedule (if any exists). This would imply NP-membership of the decision problem for fixed k.

# Summary of new provable content
- Lemma 1: with two hunters, any pendant tree branch can be eliminated by anchoring its attachment vertex and executing the 1-hunter forest sweep inside.
- Lemma 2: with two hunters, any leaf cycle block in a cactus can be eliminated by anchoring its unique cut vertex and executing the 1-hunter path sweep on the cycle minus that vertex.
- Theorem 3: for connected cactus graphs, h(G)=1 if acyclic and h(G)=2 otherwise. Recognition and schedule construction are linear-time on this class.
