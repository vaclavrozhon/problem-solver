  "summary_md": "This round formalized several structural lemmas and constructive algorithms for the hunters\u2013rabbit evasion number. Key verified tools: the R-recurrence R_{i+1}=N(R_i)\\S_{i+1} (schedule verification); the permanent-blockers lemma h(G) \u2264 |U|+h(G\u2212U); and the disjoint-union and separator-composition bounds. Constructive results: an explicit 1\u2011hunter forward/backward sweep proves h(P_n)=1 and yields the classification h(G)=1 iff G is a forest (leaf double\u2011shot induction). Using an anchor plus the path sweep we proved h(C_n)=2 for all n and hence h=2 for unicyclic graphs. Algorithmic consequences: h(G) \u2264 fvs(G)+1 (block feedback vertices) gives an n^{O(k)} YES-recognizer on graphs with fvs\u2264k\u22121; periodic-lift verification and the pathwidth bound h(G) \u2264 pw(G)+1 were also established. Cautions: the Z-process Z_i is not monotone and minor\u2011monotonicity of {h\u2264k} is unsettled; cacti tightness remains open. Citations: proofs.md; research_notes.",
