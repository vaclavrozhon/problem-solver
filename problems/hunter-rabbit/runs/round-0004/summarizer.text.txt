{"summary_md":"This round formalized several structural lemmas and constructive algorithms for the hunters–rabbit evasion number. Key verified tools: the R-recurrence R_{i+1}=N(R_i)\\S_{i+1} (schedule verification); the permanent-blockers lemma h(G) ≤ |U|+h(G−U); and the disjoint-union and separator-composition bounds. Constructive results: an explicit 1‑hunter forward/backward sweep proves h(P_n)=1 and yields the classification h(G)=1 iff G is a forest (leaf double‑shot induction). Using an anchor plus the path sweep we proved h(C_n)=2 for all n and hence h=2 for unicyclic graphs. Algorithmic consequences: h(G) ≤ fvs(G)+1 (block feedback vertices) gives an n^{O(k)} YES-recognizer on graphs with fvs≤k−1; periodic-lift verification and the pathwidth bound h(G) ≤ pw(G)+1 were also established. Cautions: the Z-process Z_i is not monotone and minor‑monotonicity of {h≤k} is unsettled; cacti tightness remains open.
