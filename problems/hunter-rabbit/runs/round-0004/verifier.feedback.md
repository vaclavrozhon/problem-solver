Highlights: we now have solid, reusable tools (permanent blockers; disjoint-union law; separator/cut-vertex composition), exact solutions for cycles and unicyclic graphs (h=2), and strong structural upper bounds (h ≤ pw+1). The periodic time-lift criterion is correct and useful for verifying families of schedules. For cacti, a full h=2 classification remains unproven; a 3-hunter constructive strategy on general cacti is plausible and consistent with node-search bounds, but needs a fully formal invariant. Below are targeted critiques and next steps.

Prover 1: Targeted funneling on trees is consistent with the proven k=1 forest result and is likely correct. Anchor-transfer Lemma needs a missing precondition: at transfer time i, require a ∉ R_i (i.e., the old anchor is shot at time i); otherwise neighbors of a outside H may enter R_{i+1}. With this fix, the “necklace” (block–cut path of cycles) theorem is credible. The periodic-lift criterion is correct. Next: formalize the corrected anchor-transfer lemma and provide a complete necklace proof with explicit invariants; implement a linear-time schedule constructor.

Prover 2: The vertex-expansion bound “ι(G) ≥ k ⇒ h ≥ k+1” is valid but does not strengthen the minimum-degree lower bound (since ι ≤ δ−1). Keep it as a NO-filter but correct the remark. The periodic schedule criterion and FVS-based constructive bound (h ≤ fvs+1) are sound. The separator composition lemma is useful; formalize it carefully (no U–W edges, shoot S each round). Next: pursue bounds on the period p as a function of k (even for k=2) to enable n^{O(k)} search via the lift.

Prover 3: The Good_k least-fixpoint and downward-closure are correct and valuable for DP design. The coupling to node-search implies h ≤ pw+1; this is rigorous, with standard citations (Kinnersley; Fomin–Thilikos). The constructive 3-hunter schedule for cacti is promising; tighten the proof by specifying the anchor handover round(s) and verifying R-evolution inequalities at each step. Next: promote h ≤ pw+1 to proofs.md and refine the cactus proof to publication-level detail or extract a minimal 3-hunter-needed cactus.

Prover 4: The cactus h=2 elimination-by-leaf-block phases is flawed: once you stop shooting the attachment vertex a, previously “cleared” blocks can be recontaminated via a in later phases. To fix, maintain a global barrier invariant (as in the necklace proof) or use two permanent anchors plus a sweeper (yielding h ≤ 3). Your pendant-tree and leaf-cycle elimination lemmas are correct as schedule segments but require barrier maintenance to prevent recontamination. Next: either adopt the two-anchor framework or restrict to necklaces where a single anchor suffices.

Global next steps: (1) Add to proofs.md the periodic-lift criterion, h ≤ pw+1 via node-search, and the separator composition lemma. (2) Finish a fully formal necklace h=2 proof. (3) For general cacti, either prove h=2 with a robust anchor-transfer invariant or settle for a rigorous h ≤ 3 with two anchors + sweeper. (4) Build an n^{O(k)} YES-procedure on fvs ≤ k−1 and implement it. (5) Investigate period bounds p=f(k) to turn the time-lift into an XP algorithm for fixed k.
