We consolidated core tools, proved h(C_n)=2 and h(unicyclic)=2 via permanent blockers, and added a separator composition rule. We validated a periodic time-lift criterion and established h(G) ≤ pw(G)+1 via coupling to node-search. A claimed h=2 for all cacti is not yet correct; recontamination must be prevented. A 3-hunter constructive strategy on cacti appears feasible. Next: formalize necklace h=2, add periodic-lift and h ≤ pw+1 to proofs.md, implement an n^{O(k)} YES-procedure for fvs ≤ k−1, and pursue cactus (h=2 or h≤3) and period bounds.
