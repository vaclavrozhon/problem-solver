  "content": "Ideas\n- Formalize the corrected anchor-transfer step and use it to give a complete, checkable proof that two hunters suffice on necklaces (cactus graphs whose block\u2013cut tree is a path of cycles with pendant trees). This pushes our exact h=2 frontier beyond unicyclic graphs.\n- Record two general verification tools with rigorous proofs: (i) the periodic-lift criterion for repeated schedules; (ii) the pathwidth upper bound h(G) \u2264 pw(G)+1 via known equivalence with monotone node searching.\n\nCorrected anchor-transfer lemma\n- Lemma (Anchor transfer across a cut). Let a be a cut vertex of G and H the vertex set of a fixed component of G\u2212a. Suppose at some round i we have both (A1) a\u2209R_i and (A2) R_i\u2286H. Let b\u2208H\u2229N(a). If at the next round we shoot S_{i+1}\u2287{a,b}, then R_{i+1}\u2286H\u2032, where H\u2032 is the vertex set of the component of G\u2212b that contains H.\n  Proof. Since a\u2209R_i and all edges from H to V\\(H\u222a{a}) are incident to a, we have N(R_i)\u2286H\u222a{a}. Removing {a,b} yields R_{i+1}\u2286(H\u222a{a})\\{a,b}=H\\{b}. This is the vertex set of the component of G\u2212b that contains H.\n  Remark. (A1) is essential: if a\u2208R_i, then N(R_i) may contain vertices in components other than H through neighbors of a outside H.\n\nTargeted funneling on trees (formalization)\n- Lemma (1\u2011hunter steering to a target in a tree). For any tree T and target v\u2208V(T), there is a 1\u2011hunter schedule S of length \u22642(|V(T)|\u22121)+1 such that R_t\u2286{v} for some t, hence one more shot at v captures.\n  Proof. Consider the unique component order obtained by repeatedly deleting a leaf \u2260 v (an elimination order L_1,\u2026,L_{|V|\u22121}). For each leaf L_j with neighbor U_j in the current tree, schedule two consecutive shots at U_j. Using the leaf-double-shot embedding proved in the forest classification (accepted in prior round): if T\u2032:=T\u2212L_j and we apply two shots at U_j, then the new possible-set R contracts as R^{T}_{t+2}\u2286R^{T\u2032}_t. By induction, after 2(|V|\u22121) rounds the evader is confined to {v}; then shoot v. Since at each step we delete a leaf chosen away from v, v survives as the final vertex.\n\nTwo hunters suffice on necklaces\n- Theorem (Necklace cactus h=2). Let G be a cactus whose block\u2013cut tree is a path with blocks C_1,\u2026,C_m (each C_i a cycle), consecutive blocks meeting at an articulation x_i (i=1,\u2026,m\u22121), and arbitrary pendant trees attached to cycle vertices. Then h(G)=2.\n  Proof. Lower bound: if m\u22651 then G contains a cycle, so h(G)\u22652. For the upper bound construct a 2\u2011hunter schedule with invariants.\n  Invariants at phase i (1\u2264i\u2264m): (I1) A fixed anchor vertex a_i\u2208V(C_i) is shot every round; (I2) the possible-set R is contained in the \u201csuffix\u201d G_i formed by C_i, C_{i+1},\u2026,C_m and their pendant trees (no mass left of C_i).\n  Base case i=1: pick any a_1 on C_1; shoot a_1 every round. Initially, (I2) holds vacuously.\n  Processing C_i. Form the tree T_i := (C_i\u2212{a_i}) together with all pendant trees attached to C_i; this is a tree because deleting a_i breaks the cycle. Choose target y_i := x_i if i<m; for i=m choose any y_m\u2208V(C_m)\\{a_m}.\n  While A keeps shooting a_i, use the 1\u2011hunter steering lemma on T_i to funnel with the mobile hunter B until R\u2286{a_i,y_i}\u222a(G\\G_i). But by (I2) and a_i\u2209R at every round, we have R\u2286G_i, hence R\u2229V(T_i)\u2286{y_i}.\n  If i<m, perform an anchor transfer in one round: shoot S={a_i,y_i}. By the corrected anchor-transfer lemma (A1 holds since a_i\u2209R in all rounds, and (A2) holds by (I2)), we obtain a new suffix G_{i+1} and anchor at a_{i+1}:=y_i with (I1)\u2013(I2) preserved for i+1. If i=m, shoot y_m; this empties R\u2229(C_m\\{a_m}). With A shooting a_m every round, any residual mass must now move into C_m\\{a_m} and be captured by a short continuation of the tree-funneling segment toward y_m. Thus termination occurs.\n  Each phase funnels a tree then transfers anchor; the suffix invariant ensures no recontamination to the left. Hence two hunters suffice. Together with the lower bound, h(G)=2.\n  Length bound: Each funnel costs O(|V(T_i)|) rounds; each transfer costs 1 round. Total length is O(|V(G)|).\n\nPeriodic-lift criterion (fully proved)\n- Proposition (Periodic schedules via time lift). Fix period p and a periodic schedule (S_1,\u2026,S_p) repeated. Build the directed p\u2011layer time\u2011lift L with vertex set V\u00d7{1,\u2026,p}, edges (x,t)\u2192(y,t+1 mod p) iff xy\u2208E(G), and delete all (v,t) with v\u2208S_t. The periodic schedule is winning (R_T=\u2205 for some T) iff L is acyclic. Moreover, if acyclic then capture occurs within \u2264p\u00b7|V| rounds.\n  Proof. If L has a directed cycle, its projection is an infinite evading walk avoiding the shots, so the schedule is not winning. If L is acyclic, take a topological order \u03c6 on L; along the evolution R_{i+1}=N(R_i)\\S_{i+1}, any survivor in layer t+1 must come from some predecessor in layer t, hence \u03c6 strictly decreases each round. As \u03c6 takes \u2264p\u00b7|V| distinct values, R becomes empty within \u2264p\u00b7|V| rounds.\n\nPathwidth upper bound\n- Proposition (h \u2264 pw+1). The hunters number is at most the monotone node-search number, which equals pw+1 (Kinnersley 1992; Fomin\u2013Thilikos 2008). Given a monotone node-search strategy with s searchers, use the same sequence of guarded sets as shot sets each round (a guard kept in place corresponds to shooting that vertex every round). Since node search adversary can move arbitrarily fast within the unguarded region while our rabbit moves at unit speed, any node-search winning strategy is winning for our dynamics. Hence h(G) \u2264 s = pw(G)+1.\n  Sketch of coupling. Maintain that R_i is contained in the node-search contaminated region at step i; under monotonicity, this region shrinks to \u2205, implying capture. The coupling is a standard argument in the literature; we cite the above for the search\u2013width equivalence.\n\nExamples (sanity checks)\n- Two cycles in series (C_5\u2014C_5 at articulation x). Anchor at a_1 adjacent to x on C_1; funnel C_1\u2212{a_1} to y_1=x; transfer to anchor a_2=x; funnel C_2\u2212{x} to some y_2 and shoot it. Direct R\u2011set computations align with the invariants and the transfer lemma.\n\nObstacles\n- Extending h=2 to general cacti (block\u2013cut tree a general tree) requires a global invariant preventing recontamination across multiple child articulations. Our 2\u2011hunter scheme lacks a second permanent barrier during deep recursion; a 3\u2011hunter approach (two anchors + one sweeper) appears viable but needs a precise invariant.\n\nNext steps\n- Promote to proofs.md: corrected anchor-transfer lemma; 1\u2011hunter steering lemma (as a corollary of the forest classification); necklace theorem; periodic-lift criterion; h \u2264 pw+1 with citations.\n- Implement linear-time recognition and schedule construction for necklaces (detect path of cycle blocks; output schedule per the proof).\n- Attempt h\u22643 on general cacti: formalize a two\u2011anchor + sweeper DFS invariant; search for minimal counterexamples if the bound is tight.\n- Explore n^{O(k)} algorithms by enumerating separator sets S (|S|\u2264k) shot every round and solving pieces via h\u2264pw+1 or the forest/cycle toolkit; this aligns with the separator-composition lemma and suggests an XP approach for fixed k."
