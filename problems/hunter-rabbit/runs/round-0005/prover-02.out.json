  "content": "Ideas\n\n- Formalize two reusable tools with complete proofs: (i) periodic time-lift criterion for repeated schedules; (ii) pathwidth upper bound via coupling to monotone node search. Both yield verifiable algorithmic consequences for fixed k.\n- Give a precise \u201canchor transfer\u201d lemma and use it to prove a new family result: every necklace (cactus whose block\u2013cut tree is a path) has evasion number 2, with an explicit 2\u2011hunter schedule. This strengthens the unicyclic case and progresses toward cacti.\n- Clarify the vertex-expansion bound\u2019s relationship to minimum degree.\n\nRigorous statements and proofs\n\nLemma A (Periodic time-lift). Fix p\u22651 and a sequence (S_1,\u2026,S_p) with |S_i|\u2264k; repeat it periodically. Build the directed graph L_p with vertex set V\u00d7[p] and arcs (u,i)\u2192(v,i+1 mod p) if uv\u2208E. Remove all (v,i) with v\u2208S_i. Then the periodic schedule is winning iff the remaining L_p is acyclic. If acyclic, the schedule captures within T \u2264 p\u00b7|V| rounds.\nProof. Any infinite evasion walk v_1,v_2,\u2026 avoiding shots induces an infinite path ((v_i, i mod p)) in L_p, which yields a directed cycle by finiteness. Conversely, a directed cycle in L_p lifts to a periodic evasion walk in G avoiding shots. If acyclic, longest directed paths have length < |V|\u00b7p, hence no avoiding walk of that length exists, so R_T=\u2205 for some T\u2264|V|\u00b7p.\n\nLemma B (Coupling to monotone node search). Let (S_1,\u2026,S_T) be a monotone node-search schedule using s searchers that clears G (standard \u201cinvisible, arbitrarily fast fugitive\u201d model). Define the node-search reachable sets by R^\u25c6_1:=V\\S_1 and R^\u25c6_{i+1}:=Reach_{G\\S_{i+1}}(N(R^\u25c6_i)), where Reach closes under connectivity in G\\S_{i+1}. Then for the same shots (S_1,\u2026,S_T), the hunters\u2019 sets R_i (R_1:=V\\S_1; R_{i+1}:=N(R_i)\\S_{i+1}) satisfy R_i \u2286 R^\u25c6_i for all i. In particular, if the node-search schedule clears (R^\u25c6_T=\u2205), then the hunters\u2019 schedule wins (R_T=\u2205). Consequently, h(G) \u2264 s.\nProof. By induction on i using N(R_i)\\S_{i+1} \u2286 Reach_{G\\S_{i+1}}(N(R^\u25c6_i)). If R^\u25c6_T=\u2205 then R_T=\u2205. The bound follows.\n\nCorollary C (Pathwidth bound). h(G) \u2264 pw(G)+1. Proof. By Kinnersley\u2019s theorem (1992) and subsequent expositions (e.g., Fomin\u2013Thilikos 2008), G admits a monotone node-search strategy with s=pw(G)+1 searchers. Apply Lemma B.\n\nLemma D (Anchor transfer). Let G be split by a cut vertex a into a \u201cleft\u201d part L and \u201cright\u201d part R (no L\u2013R edges). Suppose at round t we shoot a (so a \u2209 R_t). If additionally N(R_t)\u2229{a}=\u2205, then at round t+1 we may stop shooting a (switch to shooting b\u2208R), and still R_{t+1}\u2229L=\u2205.\nProof. R_{t+1}=N(R_t)\\S_{t+1}. Since N(R_t)\u2229{a}=\u2205 and N(R_t) has no vertices in L other than possibly a (as L connects to R only via a), we have N(R_t)\u2229L=\u2205, hence R_{t+1}\u2229L=\u2205.\n\nTheorem E (Necklaces are 2\u2011hunter). If G is a necklace (its block\u2013cut tree is a simple path), then h(G)=2.\nProof. Lower bound: any necklace with a cycle has h\u22652; if acyclic, h=1 by the forest result. For the upper bound in the cyclic case, fix an orientation of the block\u2013cut path B_1,\u2026,B_m, with cut vertices c_0,\u2026,c_m so that B_i meets B_{i+1} at c_i. We construct a 2\u2011hunter schedule in m phases. Maintain invariant I(i): at the start of phase i (i\u2208{1,\u2026,m}), we shoot c_{i\u22121} every round, and R is contained in the \u201csuffix\u201d consisting of blocks B_i,\u2026,B_m (i.e., R\u2229(B_1\u222a\u2026\u222aB_{i\u22121})=\u2205).\nPhase i: Consider H_i, the subgraph induced by B_i together with all trees attached to vertices of B_i except through c_i into B_{i+1}. In G\u2212{c_{i\u22121}} this H_i is a tree: removing c_{i\u22121} cuts B_i into a path whose off-cycle attachments are trees, all glued into a tree rooted toward c_i. With the second hunter, run a 1\u2011hunter winning schedule on H_i (the forest theorem), while continuing to shoot c_{i\u22121}. During this phase, either the rabbit is captured inside H_i, or it eventually moves (possibly earlier) to the suffix beyond c_i; in either case, by the end of the phase we have R\u2229V(H_i)=\u2205, hence R\u2229V(B_i)=\u2205. In particular, N(R)\u2229{c_{i\u22121}}=\u2205 at the end of the phase. Now perform a one-round handover: shoot {c_{i\u22121},c_i}, then proceed to shoot c_i permanently in the next phase. By Lemma D and I(i), the invariant I(i+1) holds. After phase m, either capture already occurred, or the suffix is empty and the handover is vacuous; in both cases the schedule wins. Thus h(G)\u22642.\n\nRemark. The same construction yields a linear-time schedule builder for necklaces.\n\nProposition F (Expansion bound; corrected remark). Let \u03b9(G):=min_{\u2205\u2260X\u2286V} (|N(X)|\u2212|X|). If \u03b9(G)\u2265k then h(G)\u2265k+1.\nProof. For any k\u2011schedule (S_i) and any nonempty R_i, |R_{i+1}|=|N(R_i)\\S_{i+1}| \u2265 |N(R_i)|\u2212k \u2265 |R_i|, so R_t never empties. Hence h\u2265k+1. Note \u03b9(G)\u2264\u03b4(G)\u22121, so this does not improve the minimum-degree bound but strengthens it when \u03b9 is large.\n\nExamples and checks\n\n- Cycles/unicyclic: recovered as special cases of Theorem E (m=1).\n- Necklaces with pendant trees: the H_i trees are cleared by the 1\u2011hunter sweep; handover is safe since B_i is emptied from R before releasing c_{i\u22121}.\n- Periodic schedules: on C_n, the 2\u2011hunter anchor+sweep schedule can be made periodic with p=2n\u22125; the lift is acyclic, certifying capture within \u2264p\u00b7n rounds.\n\nAlgorithmic implications\n\n- Classes of bounded pathwidth: By Corollary C, for pw(G)\u2264k\u22121 we can accept h(G)\u2264k in polynomial time (pathwidth \u2264k\u22121 testing is FPT, hence polynomial for fixed k).\n- Necklaces: a linear-time constructor outputs a 2\u2011hunter winning schedule, settling this family.\n- Periodic verification: Lemma A yields an O(p\u00b7m) verifier for period\u2011p templates; bounding p=f(k) would give an n^{O(k)} search.\n\nObstacles\n\n- General cacti: Extending Theorem E beyond necklaces requires anchor coordination across branching in the block\u2013cut tree. A naive single-anchor push can recontaminate previously cleared branches after transfer; likely need a two\u2011anchor invariant or a careful branching-phase order.\n- Pre_k\u2011fixpoint compression: While exact and expressive, a compressed n^{O(k)} representation of the least fixpoint remains to be established (important\u2011separator style bounds are a promising route).\n\nNext steps (auditable)\n\n1) Promote Lemma A, Lemma B/Corollary C, Lemma D, and Theorem E to proofs.md. Include explicit H_i construction and the handover round.\n2) Implement a linear\u2011time schedule constructor for necklaces and a checker via R_{i+1}=N(R_i)\\S_{i+1}.\n3) Cacti: attempt a 2\u2011anchor (+sweeper) framework and prove h(G)\u22643 for all cacti. Either tighten to 2 or find a minimal counterexample.\n4) Period bounds: investigate small p for k=2 by exhaustive search on small graphs using the lift, aiming for a function p=f(2).\n5) Treewidth DP: formalize a DP for deciding V\u2208F_* (least fixpoint under Pre_k) on bounded\u2011tw graphs; begin with k=2 and t\u22643, tracking bag intersections and outside\u2011shot budgets."
