  "content": "Ideas\n- Formalize two reusable mechanisms: (i) periodic time-lift for verifying repeating schedules; (ii) cut-vertex barriers (including safe anchor transfer). Both are schedule-agnostic tools that feed into constructive strategies and DPs.\n- Prove that necklace cacti (block\u2013cut tree is a path) satisfy h(G)\u22642 via a single moving anchor and one sweeper, with fully explicit R-invariants. This cleanly separates the necklace case from theta cacti (three cycles around a 2-vertex cut), supporting the conjecture that some cacti need 3.\n- Refine the two-anchors-plus-sweeper scheme on general cacti by stating and proving a precise anchor-transfer lemma for barriers, closing a gap flagged in feedback.\n\nPeriodic schedules: time-lift criterion (formal)\nDefinition. Fix period p and schedule (S_1,\u2026,S_p), repeated indefinitely. Define the time-lift digraph L_p on V\u00d7[p], with edges (x,i)\u2192(y,i+1) whenever xy\u2208E and y\u2209S_{i+1} (indices mod p). Let U:=\u22c3_{i=1}^p (S_i\u00d7{i}).\nTheorem 1 (Periodic-lift). The periodic schedule is winning iff the digraph L_p\\U is acyclic. In that case, capture occurs in \u2264 p\u00b7|V| rounds.\nProof. Under repetition, the R-evolution satisfies R_{i+1} = \u03c0_{i+1}( N_{L_p}( R_i\u00d7{i} ) ), where \u03c0 projects to V and indices are mod p. Thus an infinite evasion walk exists iff there is a directed cycle in L_p\\U (standard pumping: a bi-infinite path projects to a cycle). Conversely, if L_p\\U is acyclic, every path has length \u2264 p\u00b7|V|, so R_t=\u2205 for some t\u2264p\u00b7|V|. \u220e\n\nBarriers at cut vertices: invariants and safe transfer\nLemma 2 (Cut barrier). Let a be a cut vertex splitting V=U\u2294W\u2294{a} with no U\u2013W edges. If at time i we have R_i\u2286W\u222a{a} and a\u2208S_{i+1}, then R_{i+1}\u2286W. In particular, if R_i\u2229U=\u2205 and a\u2208S_{i+1}, then R_{i+1}\u2229U=\u2205.\nProof. Any z\u2208U has neighbors only in U\u222a{a}. Since a\u2208S_{i+1} and R_i\u2286W\u222a{a}, N(R_i)\u2229U=\u2205. Thus R_{i+1}\u2229U=\u2205. \u220e\n\nLemma 3 (Anchor transfer). Let a,b be two cut vertices with V partitioned as V=U\u2294M\u2294W and no U\u2013W edges, such that every path from U to W meets {a,b} and M contains all vertices whose U\u2013W paths pass through both a and b. Suppose R_i\u2286W\u222a{a}. If S_{i+1}\u2287{a,b}, then R_{i+1}\u2286W\u222a{b}; moreover, if thereafter b\u2208S_{i+2} then R_{i+2}\u2286W\u222a{b} (so a can be safely released after the transfer round).\nProof. With both a,b shot at i+1, no vertex in U can be reached in one step from R_i. Hence R_{i+1}\u2286W\u222aM. Vertices in M that can reach U in one step must be b (by definition of M as the \u201cbetween\u201d region), and b\u2208S_{i+1}. Thus R_{i+1}\u2286W\u222a{b}. Shooting b at i+2 preserves R_{i+2}\u2286W\u222a{b} by Lemma 2 with cut vertex b. \u220e\n\nNecklaces (block\u2013cut path) are 2-hunter\nDefinition. A cactus G is a necklace if its block\u2013cut tree is a path; equivalently, blocks B_1,\u2026,B_m form a chain connected by articulations a_1,\u2026,a_{m\u22121}, with no branching.\nTheorem 4. If G is a necklace, then h(G)\u22642.\nProof. Root the chain at the leftmost block. We proceed from left to right maintaining the invariant: at each step, a single anchor a_j is permanently shot (S includes {a_j}), and the sweeper operates on the right side of a_j. For a cycle block B containing a_j, B\\{a_j} is a path; for an edge block incident to a_j, nothing remains to clean. The sweeper performs a 1-hunter forest schedule on the component to the right of a_j that is \u201cexposed\u201d by shooting a_j (valid by our k=1 forest theorem). No recontamination from the left occurs by Lemma 2. To move from articulation a_j to a_{j+1}, take one transfer round with S={a_j,a_{j+1}} (Lemma 3), then keep only a_{j+1} shot and continue. Since blocks are processed monotonically rightward and transfer rounds isolate both sides, cleaned parts remain clean. Eventually the unique unprocessed suffix (containing the evader) is swept and capture occurs. \u220e\nRemarks. The schedule is linear-time constructible; a global horizon bound is O(n) (sum of local tree-sweep lengths plus O(m) transfers). This proof crucially uses the path structure (no branching at articulations).\n\nCacti: two anchors + one sweeper (refined)\nTheorem 5 (Cacti upper bound). For any cactus G, h(G)\u22643.\nProof sketch (refined invariant). Root the block\u2013cut tree arbitrarily. Maintain two anchors a,b: the pair separates the already-cleaned region from the frontier subtree currently being processed. Invariant at step i: R_i is contained in the not-yet-processed side together with possibly {a,b}; S_i\u2287{a,b}. Within the current frontier block, the sweeper (third hunter) cleans B\\{a,b} (a path if B is a cycle; trivial if an edge). For handovers to a child block B\u2032 through articulation x, use one transfer round S={a,x} (keeping the other anchor fixed) to shift the barrier; Lemma 3 (applied in the tree-of-blocks) guarantees no leakage. Repeat by DFS. This closes the gap noted in feedback: during transfers we explicitly shoot both old and new anchors. \u220e\n\n\u201cNo progress under dual anchor\u201d (useful lower-bound sublemma)\nLemma 6. Let S be a vertex cut such that G\u2212S has no isolated vertices. If every round shoots all of S and no other vertices, then R_t\u2260\u2205 for all t\u22651 (hence capture is impossible under such a schedule).\nProof. With S fixed, R_{i+1}=N_{G\u2212S}(R_i) in G\u2212S. Since G\u2212S has minimum degree \u22651, N_{G\u2212S}(X)=\u2205 iff X=\u2205. As R_1=V\\S\u2260\u2205, the sequence never hits \u2205. \u220e\nComment. This lemma underpins the intuition that on a theta cactus with S={s,t}, two hunters cannot make progress while keeping both endpoints permanently blocked; to shrink R within any interior path, an extra shot (a sweeper) is needed.\n\nExamples and checks\n- Necklace of r cycles: h\u22642 by Theorem 4. For each cycle, anchor at the articulation and sweep the path remainder; for transfer, shoot both articulations once.\n- Theta cactus \u0398 with terminals s,t and three internally disjoint s\u2013t paths: h\u22643 by Theorem 5. Whether h(\u0398)=2 or 3 depends on path lengths; we conjecture h(\u0398)=3 when all three paths have length \u22652. Lemma 6 shows that purely anchoring {s,t} achieves no progress; any attempt to free one endpoint to shoot inside a path appears to allow cross-over to another path\u2014this is our target for a formal 2-hunter impossibility proof.\n\nAlgorithmic implications\n- Necklace recognizer and schedule constructor: linear-time via block\u2013cut decomposition; always accept h\u22642 with an explicit O(n)-length schedule (Theorem 4).\n- Cacti: unconditional acceptance h\u22643 in linear time (Theorem 5); searching for tightness (h=2 vs h=3) reduces to detecting theta-like substructures susceptible to a 2-hunter lower bound.\n- Periodic strategies: Theorem 1 reduces verification of period-p patterns to an acyclicity test in a digraph of size p\u00b7n. This enables XP-time searches over (S_1,\u2026,S_p) when p is small (e.g., p bounded as a function of k) and under structural constraints.\n\nObstacles\n- Formal 2-hunter lower bound on theta cacti: we need a clean adversarial argument using the fixed schedule to ensure placement at a soon-to-be-released endpoint at transfer times; Lemma 6 handles the \u201cboth endpoints always shot\u201d branch, but the mixed branch needs a robust R-invariant.\n- General DP over tree decompositions: while Good_k is downward-closed, naive antichain states over a bag are too many. We need a k-sensitive compression (e.g., only boundary subsets with distinct k-neighborhood deficits |N(X)\\Y|) to bound state counts by f(k,tw).\n\nNext steps\n1) Promote Theorem 1 (periodic-lift), Lemma 2 (barrier), Lemma 3 (anchor transfer), Theorem 4 (necklace h\u22642), and Theorem 5 (cacti h\u22643) to proofs.md with the precise R-evolution inequalities used above.\n2) Theta lower bound for k=2: attempt a formal proof for three s\u2013t paths of length \u22652 using a dichotomy over rounds with A_i=S_i\u2229{s,t} equal to {s,t} or not, stitching an evader walk aligned to the known schedule. A small-state BFS over 2^V can validate minimal counterexamples.\n3) Implement a necklace constructor and a cactus 3-hunter constructor (two anchors + sweeper) and verify on random instances up to n\u2248200 via the R-recursion.\n4) Explore k-sensitive bag-state compression for DP on treewidth: define, for a partial graph with boundary B, the family F_B of \u201cgood\u201d boundary subsets closed under one-step Pre_k with at most k deletions outside B; prove |F_B|\u2264g(k,|B|).\n5) Use Theorem 1 to search for small-period schedules on candidate hard graphs (theta cacti) to gather evidence for h=3 vs h=2 and refine lower-bound conjectures."
