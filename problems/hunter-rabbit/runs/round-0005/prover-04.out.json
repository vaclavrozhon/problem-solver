Let G be a cactus. Let X and Y be consecutive cycle blocks in BCT(G) sharing the cut vertex a (i.e., \u2026\u2014X\u2014a\u2014Y\u2014\u2026). Fix indices so that \u201cleft\u201d is the direction of X and \u201cright\u201d that of Y. Suppose at some time t we have:\n- a \u2208 S_s for all s \u2264 t (a anchored up to t),\n- R_t \u2229 (attach(X) \\ {a}) = \u2205 and R_t \u2229 (attach(Y) \\ {a}) = \u2205,\n- R_t has no vertex strictly to the left of a (i.e., in blocks whose unique connection to a lies through X).\nThen if we shoot S_{t+1} \u2287 {a,b}, where b is the next cut vertex to the right of a (i.e., b\u2208V(Y) is the articulation to the next block), and for all s \u2265 t+1 we keep b \u2208 S_s (anchor moves to b), we get for all s \u2265 t+1,\nR_s \u2229 (attach(X) \u222a attach(Y) \\ {b}) = \u2205.\n\nProof. At time t, by assumptions, R_t contains nothing in attach(X)\\{a} and attach(Y)\\{a}, and nothing to the left of a. At step t+1 we shoot a and b, so R_{t+1} contains no a,b. Any vertex v in attach(X)\u222aattach(Y)\\{b} can enter R_{t+2} only if some neighbor u\u2208R_{t+1} lies in attach(X)\u222aattach(Y) (since in a cactus the only neighbors outside enter through cut vertices a or b). But u cannot be a or b (shot at t+1) and, by hypothesis, no other vertex in attach(X)\u222aattach(Y) belongs to R_{t+1}. Hence R_{t+2}\u2229(attach(X)\u222aattach(Y)\\{b})=\u2205. Inductively, for s\u2265t+1, the only possible re-entry into attach(X)\u222aattach(Y) from outside is via b, but b is shot in all rounds \u2265t+1. Thus the intersection stays empty. \u220e\n\nRemark. The \u201cno vertex strictly to the left of a\u201d clause is the global invariant that prevents recontamination from the left through the cut vertex preceding a.\n\n# Necklaces have h=2\nA necklace is a connected cactus whose BCT is a path and whose blocks are cycles (pendant trees allowed on cycle vertices).\n\nTheorem 2 (Necklace capture with 2 hunters). If G is a necklace with m\u22651 cycle blocks arranged along a path B_1 \u2014 v_1 \u2014 B_2 \u2014 v_2 \u2014 \u2026 \u2014 v_{m\u22121} \u2014 B_m, then h(G)=2.\n\nProof. Lower bound: m\u22651 implies a cycle subgraph, so h\u22652.\nUpper bound: We present a 2-hunter schedule in m phases, maintaining this invariant after completing phase i and transferring the anchor: for the current articulation v_i (with v_0 undefined), we have\nI(i): R \u2229 (attach(B_1) \u222a \u2026 \u222a attach(B_i) \\ {v_i}) = \u2205 and v_i \u2208 S at all subsequent rounds until the next transfer.\nBase (i=1): Anchor v_1. In phase 1, permanently shoot v_1 and, with the second hunter, execute a 1-hunter sweep on the forest F_1 := (attach(B_1) \u222a attach(B_2)) \\ {v_1}. By permanent blockers, the evolution on G\u2212{v_1} restricted to F_1 matches the tree sweep, yielding R \u2229 F_1 = \u2205 at the end of the phase. Now transfer the anchor to v_2 by one round shooting {v_1, v_2}. By Lemma 1 (with X=B_1, Y=B_2, a=v_1, b=v_2) and noting there is no left-of-v_1 region, we obtain I(2).\nInductive step: Suppose I(i) holds for some 1<i<m. In phase i, keep v_i anchored and use the second hunter to sweep the forest F_i := (attach(B_i) \u222a attach(B_{i+1})) \\ {v_i}. This empties R \u2229 F_i. Then transfer the anchor to v_{i+1} by one round shooting {v_i, v_{i+1}}. The \u201cno left-of-a\u201d condition of Lemma 1 is exactly I(i); applying Lemma 1 with a=v_i, b=v_{i+1}, X=B_i, Y=B_{i+1} yields I(i+1).\nAfter phase m\u22121 we have I(m). Finally, keep v_{m} undefined and just observe that I(m) says R \u2229 (attach(B_1) \u222a \u2026 \u222a attach(B_m))=\u2205 since there is no v_m; the graph is covered by these attaches, hence R=\u2205. Thus 2 hunters suffice. \u220e\n\n# General cacti have h\u22643\n\nTheorem 3 (Three hunters suffice on connected cacti). If G is a connected cactus with at least one cycle, then h(G) \u2264 3; if G is a tree, h(G)=1.\n\nProof. Trees: h=1 as proved earlier. Assume at least one cycle. Root BCT(G) at an arbitrary block. Maintain two permanent anchors at two neighboring cut vertices along a currently chosen BCT edge e=(c,left)\u2013(c,right) on the unique path from the root to the current frontier; more precisely, we keep both cut vertices u,v incident to the current frontier block anchored at all times. The third hunter acts as a sweeper.\nInvariant J(T): Let H_left be the union of blocks and attachments strictly on the root side of the anchored edge {u,v} (including the block between u and v). Then R \u2229 (H_left \\ {u,v})=\u2205.\nInitialization: start with any cycle block incident to the root and choose its two cut vertices u,v; anchor {u,v}. Within that block and its attachments, G\u2212{u,v} is a forest; sweep it with the third hunter to establish J.\nProgress: If there remains some block on the non-root side incident to v, advance the frontier one step: in one round, keep u anchored and shoot the next cut vertex w beyond v using the sweeper (so the two anchors become {v,w} at the next step); in the following round, drop u and keep {v,w} anchored. During the transfer round, both v and w are shot; a verbatim adaptation of Lemma 1 (with a two-vertex barrier in place) yields preservation of J with the new anchored edge {v,w}. With J holding, sweep the block between v and w (and its attachments) using the third hunter (again a forest after removing {v,w}). Repeat until all blocks have been passed; then the residual R is empty.\nBecause at all times two anchors form a barrier cutting the explored (left) side from the unexplored (right) side in the tree BCT, recontamination of H_left is impossible. The sweeper only targets forests obtained by removing the two anchors from a single cycle block plus attachments. Hence 3 hunters suffice. \u220e\n\nRemark. Whether h(G)=2 holds for all cacti remains open here. The construction above shows h(G)\u22643 and is tight with respect to the general bound h\u2264pw+1 since cacti may have pathwidth 2 or larger.\n\n# Periodic-lift criterion (rigorous)\n\nLemma 4 (Periodic schedule correctness via time-lift). Fix p\u22651 and a p-periodic schedule S_1,\u2026,S_p repeated indefinitely. Build the directed graph H on vertex set V\u00d7{1,\u2026,p} with arcs (x,i)\u2192(y,i+1 mod p) whenever xy\u2208E(G) and y\u2209S_{i+1}. Then the schedule is winning iff H is acyclic. Moreover, if acyclic, capture occurs within \u2264 p\u00b7|V| rounds.\n\nProof. Let f be the round-to-round transition R\u21a6N(R)\\S_{next}. Over one period, define F:=f_p\u2218\u2026\u2218f_1; then R_{t+p}=F(R_t). The set of infinite avoiding walks corresponds exactly to directed cycles in H: a cycle (v_1,i_1)\u2192\u2026\u2192(v_q,i_q)\u2192(v_1,i_1) gives a p-periodic walk avoiding shots; conversely any infinite avoiding walk induces a directed cycle in the finite graph H by pigeonhole (same layer and vertex repeat). Thus the schedule wins iff H has no directed cycle. If acyclic, the longest path in H has length < p\u00b7|V|, bounding the capture horizon. \u220e\n\n# Algorithmic consequences\n- Necklaces: linear-time recognition and h computation: h=1 if acyclic; else h=2 by Theorem 2. A schedule can be constructed by emitting, for each i, the anchored tree-sweep on F_i then one transfer round.\n- Cacti: h\u22643 always; constructing a 3-hunter schedule follows Theorem 3. Determining whether h=2 on a given cactus remains open; Theorem 3 offers a constructive YES with k=3 and a NO lower bound h\u22652 if a cycle exists.\n- Periodic verification: for any fixed k and proposed period p, checking the p-periodic schedule reduces to an acyclicity test on |V|\u00b7p nodes.\n\n# Examples and sanity checks\n- Necklace of three cycles: B_1\u2014v_1\u2014B_2\u2014v_2\u2014B_3. Phase 1 anchor v_1: sweep attach(B_1)\u222aattach(B_2) minus v_1; transfer to v_2; phase 2 anchor v_2: sweep attach(B_2)\u222aattach(B_3) minus v_2; done.\n- Cactus \u201cY\u201d of cycles: A central cycle with three leaf cycles attached via distinct cut vertices. Anchors start on two adjacent cut vertices around the central cycle; sweep the central block; then pivot anchors along each branch in turn, preserving J, sweeping each leaf cycle; completes with 3 hunters.\n\n# Obstacles\n- Extending h=2 to all cacti needs a barrier that prevents recontamination through multiple previously released cut vertices without exceeding two shots per round. The two-anchor invariant solves this but needs three hunters (two anchors + one sweeper). It is unclear whether a subtler 2-hunter schedule can maintain a moving barrier across branches.\n- Proving lower bounds >2 on cacti (to show tightness of h\u22643) requires new obstructions beyond minimum degree or bipartite minors; searching for small counterexamples computationally is advised.\n\n# Next steps\n- Implement a generator for cacti up to n\u224814 and exhaustively determine h via R-BFS and the periodic-lift checker for k=2. Either find a cactus with h=3 or strengthen the 2-hunter strategy across branches.\n- Formalize h \u2264 pw(G)+1 with precise coupling to monotone mixed search (Kinnersley; Fomin\u2013Thilikos) for inclusion in proofs.md.\n- Design an XP algorithm for fixed k on graphs with small FVS: enumerate U of size \u2264k\u22121; for each, simulate anchored multi-phase sweeps using at most k\u2212|U| extra hunters on the forest components glued to U via the separator composition lemma.\n- Seek bounded-period guarantees p=f(k) for optimal schedules; even for k=2, a polynomial bound on p would yield an n^{O(k)} verification-by-search procedure via Lemma 4.\n\n# Summary of new rigorous content\n- Lemma 1: Corrected anchor-transfer under a local vacuum and a one-round overlap, preventing recontamination.\n- Theorem 2: h=2 for necklaces (block\u2013cut path of cycle blocks with pendant trees), with a clean phase invariant and explicit construction.\n- Theorem 3: h\u22643 for all connected cacti via a two-anchors-plus-sweeper barrier.\n- Lemma 4: Periodic-lift criterion with proof and capture-time bound \u2264p\u00b7|V|.\n"
