  "summary_md": "This round formalized key dynamics and produced constructive structural and algorithmic results. Verified schedule verification via R_{i+1}=N(R_i)\\S_{i+1} and the winning iff R_t=\u2205 criterion. Proved an explicit 1-hunter forward/backward sweep so h(P_n)=1 and completed the k=1 classification: h(G)=1 \u21d4 G is a forest (leaf double-shot induction). Introduced permanent blockers: h(G) \u2264 |U|+h(G\u2212U), and used this to show h(C_n)=2 (anchor one vertex + path sweep) and h(unicyclic)=2. Extended anchor-transfer techniques to prove necklaces (block\u2013cut path of cycles) have h=2; general cacti appear to need \u22643 (two anchors + one sweeper) but tightness is open. Established algorithmic bounds h(G) \u2264 fvs(G)+1 and h(G) \u2264 pw(G)+1, giving an n^{O(k)} YES-recognizer on graphs with fvs\u2264k\u22121 and polytime acceptance for pw\u2264k\u22121. Also gave a periodic-schedule verifier: a period-p schedule wins iff the time\u2011lift digraph is acyclic. Cautions: Z-process (Z_i) is not monotone; minor\u2011monotonicity and some cactus tightness remain open. Citations: proofs.md; research_notes.",
