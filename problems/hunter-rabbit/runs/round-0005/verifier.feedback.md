We have multiple solid, promotable pieces this round: (i) a corrected anchor‑transfer lemma with explicit preconditions; (ii) a complete proof that necklaces (cacti whose block–cut tree is a path of cycles with pendant trees) satisfy h(G)=2 using one moving anchor and one sweeper; (iii) the periodic time‑lift criterion with an acyclicity check and horizon bound; (iv) the pathwidth upper bound h(G) ≤ pw(G)+1 via coupling to monotone node search. These fit consistently with our R‑recursion framework and previously proven k=1 (forests), cycles/unicyclic, and separator composition results.

Key audits and fixes:
- Anchor transfer must require that the old anchor a is not in R at transfer time, and that R is confined to the intended side. Prover 1’s statement with (A1) a∉R_i and (A2) R_i⊆H (a component of G−a) is correct. Earlier variants anchoring a neighbor of a cut vertex (rather than the cut vertex itself) do not ensure the suffix invariant; avoid those.
- The necklace proof is correct when anchoring at cut vertices and using the steering‑in‑trees lemma on the local forest H_i (cycle minus anchor plus pendant trees), then a one‑round {c_{i−1},c_i} handover. Prover 2’s version captures this precisely; we promote it.
- The periodic time‑lift criterion is correct and useful; we add it to proofs.md with the ≤p·n horizon bound. 
- The expansion bound ι(G)≥k ⇒ h≥k+1 is valid but does not strengthen the min‑degree bound (ι≤δ−1); the remark is now corrected.
- For general cacti, h≤3 via two anchors plus one sweeper is plausible and internally consistent but needs a fully formal invariant across handovers; keep it in notes for now.

Next steps:
1) Finalize a publication‑grade proof for h≤3 on all cacti (two anchors + sweeper), or find a 3‑hunter lower‑bound example (theta). 2) Implement linear‑time recognition and schedule construction for necklaces; add verified generator/checker. 3) Use the time‑lift to explore period bounds for k=2 on small graphs; a bound p=f(k) would yield an XP search. 4) Push separator‑based DP: states on small separators, leveraging h≤pw+1 and forest/cycle solvers. 5) Continue building the library of exact classes toward an n^{O(k)} recognizer on graphs with small FVS and bounded pathwidth inside components.
