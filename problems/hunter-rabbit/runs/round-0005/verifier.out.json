  "feedback_md": "We have multiple solid, promotable pieces this round: (i) a corrected anchor\u2011transfer lemma with explicit preconditions; (ii) a complete proof that necklaces (cacti whose block\u2013cut tree is a path of cycles with pendant trees) satisfy h(G)=2 using one moving anchor and one sweeper; (iii) the periodic time\u2011lift criterion with an acyclicity check and horizon bound; (iv) the pathwidth upper bound h(G) \u2264 pw(G)+1 via coupling to monotone node search. These fit consistently with our R\u2011recursion framework and previously proven k=1 (forests), cycles/unicyclic, and separator composition results.\n\nKey audits and fixes:\n- Anchor transfer must require that the old anchor a is not in R at transfer time, and that R is confined to the intended side. Prover 1\u2019s statement with (A1) a\u2209R_i and (A2) R_i\u2286H (a component of G\u2212a) is correct. Earlier variants anchoring a neighbor of a cut vertex (rather than the cut vertex itself) do not ensure the suffix invariant; avoid those.\n- The necklace proof is correct when anchoring at cut vertices and using the steering\u2011in\u2011trees lemma on the local forest H_i (cycle minus anchor plus pendant trees), then a one\u2011round {c_{i\u22121},c_i} handover. Prover 2\u2019s version captures this precisely; we promote it.\n- The periodic time\u2011lift criterion is correct and useful; we add it to proofs.md with the \u2264p\u00b7n horizon bound. \n- The expansion bound \u03b9(G)\u2265k \u21d2 h\u2265k+1 is valid but does not strengthen the min\u2011degree bound (\u03b9\u2264\u03b4\u22121); the remark is now corrected.\n- For general cacti, h\u22643 via two anchors plus one sweeper is plausible and internally consistent but needs a fully formal invariant across handovers; keep it in notes for now.\n\nNext steps:\n1) Finalize a publication\u2011grade proof for h\u22643 on all cacti (two anchors + sweeper), or find a 3\u2011hunter lower\u2011bound example (theta). 2) Implement linear\u2011time recognition and schedule construction for necklaces; add verified generator/checker. 3) Use the time\u2011lift to explore period bounds for k=2 on small graphs; a bound p=f(k) would yield an XP search. 4) Push separator\u2011based DP: states on small separators, leveraging h\u2264pw+1 and forest/cycle solvers. 5) Continue building the library of exact classes toward an n^{O(k)} recognizer on graphs with small FVS and bounded pathwidth inside components.",

If a is a cut vertex, H a component of G\u2212a, and at some round i we have a\u2209R_i and R_i\u2286H, then shooting {a,b} with b\u2208H\u2229N(a) yields R_{i+1}\u2286H\u2032, where H\u2032 is the component of G\u2212b containing H. This prevents leakage across a and enables safe handovers.\n- Necklaces (cacti with a path of cycle blocks) have h=2. Maintain a single cut-vertex anchor c_{i\u22121} and sweep the forest formed by the current cycle block plus its pendant trees (with c_{i\u22121} removed), then transfer the anchor to c_i in one round by shooting {c_{i\u22121},c_i}. Repeat along the chain. This generalizes unicyclic h=2.\n- Periodic schedules.

    "content": "Lemma (Anchor transfer across a cut). Let a be a cut vertex of G and H the vertex set of a component of G\u2212a. Suppose for some round i we have a\u2209R_i and R_i\u2286H. Let b\u2208H\u2229N(a). If S_{i+1}\u2287{a,b}, then R_{i+1}\u2286H\u2032, where H\u2032 is the vertex set of the component of G\u2212b that contains H.\nProof. Since R_i\u2286H and the only edges from H to V\\(H\u222a{a}) go through a, we have N(R_i)\u2286H\u222a{a}. Removing {a,b} gives R_{i+1}=N(R_i)\\S_{i+1}\u2286(H\u222a{a})\\{a,b}=H\\{b}, which is contained in the component of G\u2212b that contains H. \u220e\n\nLemma (1-hunter steering to a target in a tree). Let T be a tree and v\u2208V(T). There exists a 1-hunter schedule S of length \u2264 2(|V(T)|\u22121)+1 such that for some t, R_t\u2286{v}, hence one more shot at v captures.\nProof. Order the vertices by repeatedly deleting a leaf \u2113\u2260v from the current tree. For each deleted leaf with neighbor u, shoot u in two consecutive rounds. By the leaf double-shot embedding (established in the forest classification), if T\u2032=T\u2212\u2113 then after these two rounds R contracts as R^{T}_{t+2}\u2286R^{T\u2032}_t. After processing all |V(T)|\u22121 leaves distinct from v, we have R\u2286{v}; shooting v captures. \u220e\n\nTheorem (Necklaces have h=2). Let G be a necklace: its block\u2013cut tree is B_1 \u2014 c_1 \u2014 B_2 \u2014 c_2 \u2014 \u2026 \u2014 c_{m\u22121} \u2014 B_m, where each B_i is a cycle and pendant trees may attach to cycle vertices. Then h(G)=2.\nProof. If m=0 (no cycles), G is a forest and h=1. Assume m\u22651; then h\u22652 by the cycle lower bound. For the upper bound we build a 2-hunter schedule in m phases. Invariant I(i): at the start of phase i (1\u2264i\u2264m), the cut vertex c_{i\u22121} (with c_0 undefined) is shot every round (the anchor), and R lies entirely in the suffix consisting of blocks B_i,\u2026,B_m and their pendant trees (equivalently, R\u2229(B_1\u222a\u2026\u222aB_{i\u22121})=\u2205). Base i=1 holds vacuously. During phase i, keep c_{i\u22121} shot and let H_i be the forest obtained from B_i\u222a(pendant trees on B_i) by deleting c_{i\u22121} and the attachment toward c_i. By the 1-hunter steering lemma, a single hunter funnels H_i to the articulation toward c_i, emptying R\u2229V(B_i). Then take one transfer round S={c_{i\u22121},c_i}. By the anchor-transfer lemma with a=c_{i\u22121}, b=c_i, and H the component of G\u2212c_{i\u22121}} containing the suffix, we obtain I(i+1). After phase m, I(m) implies R\u2229(B_1\u222a\u2026\u222aB_m)=\u2205, hence R=\u2205. Therefore two hunters suffice. Together with the lower bound, h(G)=2. \u220e"
