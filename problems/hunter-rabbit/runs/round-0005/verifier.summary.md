We added rigor on: corrected anchor transfer; necklaces have h=2 via a moving cut-vertex anchor and a 1-hunter tree sweep; periodic time-lift (acyclicity iff winning, horizon ≤ p·n); and h ≤ pw+1 via node search. General cacti: h≤3 via two anchors + sweeper is plausible but not yet fully formal. Next: formalize cacti h≤3, implement necklace constructor, seek period bounds for k=2, and build separator-based DP.
