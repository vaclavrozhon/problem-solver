  "feedback_md": "We have multiple solid, promotable pieces this round: (i) a corrected anchor‑transfer lemma with explicit preconditions; (ii) a complete proof that necklaces (cacti whose block–cut tree is a path of cycles with pendant trees) satisfy h(G)=2 using one moving anchor and one sweeper; (iii) the periodic time‑lift criterion with an acyclicity check and horizon bound; (iv) the pathwidth upper bound h(G) ≤ pw(G)+1 via coupling to monotone node search. These fit consistently with our R‑recursion framework and previously proven k=1 (forests), cycles/unicyclic, and separator composition results.\n\nKey audits and fixes:\n- Anchor transfer must require that the old anchor a is not in R at transfer time, and that R is confined to the intended side. Prover 1’s statement with (A1) a∉R_i and (A2) R_i⊆H (a component of G−a) is correct. Earlier variants anchoring a neighbor of a cut vertex (rather than the cut vertex itself) do not ensure the suffix invariant; avoid those.\n- The necklace proof is correct when anchoring at cut vertices and using the steering‑in‑trees lemma on the local forest H_i (cycle minus anchor plus pendant trees), then a one‑round {c_{i−1},c_i} handover. Prover 2’s version captures this precisely; we promote it.\n- The periodic time‑lift criterion is correct and useful; we add it to proofs.md with the ≤p·n horizon bound. \n- The expansion bound ι(G)≥k ⇒ h≥k+1 is valid but does not strengthen the min‑degree bound (ι≤δ−1); the remark is now corrected.\n- For general cacti, h≤3 via two anchors plus one sweeper is plausible and internally consistent but needs a fully formal invariant across handovers; keep it in notes for now.\n\nNext steps:\n1) Finalize a publication‑grade proof for h≤3 on all cacti (two anchors + sweeper), or find a 3‑hunter lower‑bound example (theta). 2) Implement linear‑time recognition and schedule construction for necklaces; add verified generator/checker. 3) Use the time‑lift to explore period bounds for k=2 on small graphs; a bound p=f(k) would yield an XP search. 4) Push separator‑based DP: states on small separators, leveraging h≤pw+1 and forest/cycle solvers. 5) Continue building the library of exact classes toward an n^{O(k)} recognizer on graphs with small FVS and bounded pathwidth inside components.",

    "content": "New settled results and tools\n- Corrected anchor transfer. If a is a cut vertex, H a component of G−a, and at some round i we have a∉R_i and R_i⊆H, then shooting {a,b} with b∈H∩N(a) yields R_{i+1}⊆H′, where H′ is the component of G−b containing H. This prevents leakage across a and enables safe handovers.\n- Necklaces (cacti with a path of cycle blocks) have h=2. Maintain a single cut-vertex anchor c_{i−1} and sweep the forest formed by the current cycle block plus its pendant trees (with c_{i−1} removed), then transfer the anchor to c_i in one round by shooting {c_{i−1},c_i}. Repeat along the chain. This generalizes unicyclic h=2.\n- Periodic schedules. A p-periodic schedule is winning iff the time-lift on V×[p] (with layer shots removed) is acyclic; if acyclic, capture occurs within ≤ p·|V| rounds. This gives a finite verifier for periodic strategies.\n- Pathwidth upper bound. h(G) ≤ pw(G)+1 via coupling to monotone node search; for pw≤k−1 classes, we can accept h≤k in polytime.\n\nCautions\n- Anchoring a neighbor of a cut vertex (instead of the cut vertex) can break the suffix invariant and allow recontamination. Always anchor at cut vertices for barrier arguments.\n- Expansion bound ι(G)≥k ⇒ h≥k+1 is valid but does not improve the minimum-degree bound (ι≤δ−1); use as a NO-filter only.\n\nOpen directions\n- General cacti: prove h≤3 with two anchors + one sweeper (formal invariant across handovers), and decide whether some cacti require 3.\n- Period bounds: seek p=f(k) for winning periodic schedules (start with k=2) to turn the time-lift into an XP search.\n- Separator DP: combine permanent blockers on small separators with exact solvers on pieces (forests, cycles, necklaces) and h≤pw+1 on bounded-width parts."

    "content": "Lemma (Anchor transfer across a cut). Let a be a cut vertex of G and H the vertex set of a component of G−a. Suppose for some round i we have a∉R_i and R_i⊆H. Let b∈H∩N(a). If S_{i+1}⊇{a,b}, then R_{i+1}⊆H′, where H′ is the vertex set of the component of G−b that contains H.\nProof. Since R_i⊆H and the only edges from H to V\\(H∪{a}) go through a, we have N(R_i)⊆H∪{a}. Removing {a,b} gives R_{i+1}=N(R_i)\\S_{i+1}⊆(H∪{a})\\{a,b}=H\\{b}, which is contained in the component of G−b that contains H. ∎\n\nLemma (1-hunter steering to a target in a tree). Let T be a tree and v∈V(T). There exists a 1-hunter schedule S of length ≤ 2(|V(T)|−1)+1 such that for some t, R_t⊆{v}, hence one more shot at v captures.\nProof. Order the vertices by repeatedly deleting a leaf ℓ≠v from the current tree. For each deleted leaf with neighbor u, shoot u in two consecutive rounds. By the leaf double-shot embedding (established in the forest classification), if T′=T−ℓ then after these two rounds R contracts as R^{T}_{t+2}⊆R^{T′}_t. After processing all |V(T)|−1 leaves distinct from v, we have R⊆{v}; shooting v captures. ∎\n\nTheorem (Necklaces have h=2). Let G be a necklace: its block–cut tree is B_1 — c_1 — B_2 — c_2 — … — c_{m−1} — B_m, where each B_i is a cycle and pendant trees may attach to cycle vertices. Then h(G)=2.\nProof. If m=0 (no cycles), G is a forest and h=1. Assume m≥1; then h≥2 by the cycle lower bound. For the upper bound we build a 2-hunter schedule in m phases. Invariant I(i): at the start of phase i (1≤i≤m), the cut vertex c_{i−1} (with c_0 undefined) is shot every round (the anchor), and R lies entirely in the suffix consisting of blocks B_i,…,B_m and their pendant trees (equivalently, R∩(B_1∪…∪B_{i−1})=∅). Base i=1 holds vacuously. During phase i, keep c_{i−1} shot and let H_i be the forest obtained from B_i∪(pendant trees on B_i) by deleting c_{i−1} and the attachment toward c_i. By the 1-hunter steering lemma, a single hunter funnels H_i to the articulation toward c_i, emptying R∩V(B_i). Then take one transfer round S={c_{i−1},c_i}. By the anchor-transfer lemma with a=c_{i−1}, b=c_i, and H the component of G−c_{i−1}} containing the suffix, we obtain I(i+1). After phase m, I(m) implies R∩(B_1∪…∪B_m)=∅, hence R=∅. Therefore two hunters suffice. Together with the lower bound, h(G)=2. ∎"
