Definitions.
• The hunters and rabbit problem is a pursuit-evasion game played
on an undirected graph. A strategy for k hunters is a sequence
s1, s2, · · · , sn of subsets of k vertices. A strategy is winning if, for
every walk v1, v2, · · · , vn in the graph (not necessarily simple), there
is i such that vi ∈ si. Intuitively, the evader is walking on the graph
(it has to move at each turn by following exactly one edge) and must
avoid the k vertices that the pursuers examine at each time step.

• The evasion number of a graph G is the smallest k for which there
is a winning strategy with k hunters.

Question: Is it the case that, for any constant k , we can recognize
the graphs of the evasion number k in polynomial time? (E.g. n^{O(k)})
