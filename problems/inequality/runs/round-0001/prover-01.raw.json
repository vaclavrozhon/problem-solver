For x > 0, let f(x) := |{i : a_i ∈ [x, 2x]}| and let M := sup_x f(x). Any A' of the desired form can be taken as A' = {i : a_i ∈ [x, 2x]} for some x, so |A'| = f(x) ≤ M.\\n- Goal: Prove a universal inequality of the form S^2 ≤ K · T · M with the smallest possible K. This gives a guaranteed subset of size at least (1/K) · Q, so C ≥ 1/K. A matching construction will give an upper bound on C.\\n\\nMain lower bound: C ≥ 1/3\\nClaim. For every finite set A of positive reals, with M := sup_x |A ∩ [x,2x]|, we have\\nS^2 ≤ 3 · T · M.\\nProof (pairwise decomposition):\\n- Partition ordered pairs (i,j) by the ratio r_ij := a_j/a_i into dyadic bands:\\n  • Near band C_0: 1 ≤ r_ij < 2 (this includes the diagonal i=j).\\n  • Far bands C_k^+: 2^k ≤ r_ij < 2^{k+1} for k ≥ 1 (j much larger), and C_k^-: 2^{-k-1} ≤ r_ij < 2^{-k} for k ≥ 0 (j smaller).\\n- Near band bound: Using 2ab ≤ a^2 + b^2,\\n  ∑_{(i,j)∈C_0} a_i a_j ≤ 1/2 ∑_i a_i^2 · #{j: a_j ∈ [a_i,2a_i)} + 1/2 ∑_j a_j^2 · #{i: a_i ∈ [a_j/2,a_j)} ≤ M · T.\\n  Here we used #{·} ≤ M by definition of M.\\n- Far bands bound: For k ≥ 1,\\n  ∑_{(i,j)∈C_k^+} a_i a_j ≤ 2^{-k} ∑_{(i,j)∈C_k^+} a_j^2 = 2^{-k} ∑_j a_j^2 · #{i: a_i ∈ [a_j/2^{k+1}, a_j/2^k)} ≤ (M/2^k) T.\\n  Similarly, ∑_{(i,j)∈C_k^-} a_i a_j ≤ (M/2^k) T.\\n  Summing over k ≥ 1 gives total far contribution ≤ M · T since ∑_{k≥1} (1/2^k + 1/2^k) = 2.\\n- Combine: S^2 = ∑_{all ordered pairs} a_i a_j ≤ M T (near) + M T (far) + M T (far) = 3 M T.\\nHence M ≥ S^2/(3T). Choosing x that attains M gives a subset A' ⊆ A with max/min ≤ 2 and |A'| = M ≥ (1/3) Q. Therefore C ≥ 1/3.\\n\\nUpper bound: C ≤ 1/3 (tightness)\\n- Construction: Take a geometric progression A = {r^0, r^1, …, r^{m-1}} with r > 2. Then any [x,2x] contains at most one element of A, so M = 1 and the largest admissible subset has size 1.\\n- Compute Q as m → ∞: S = (r^m − 1)/(r − 1), T = (r^{2m} − 1)/(r^2 − 1), so\\n  Q = S^2/T → (r+1)/(r−1) as m → ∞.\\n  Let r ↓ 2; then Q → 3, while the maximum admissible |A'| stays 1. Thus 1 ≥ C · 3 forces C ≤ 1/3.\\n- Therefore the best possible universal constant is exactly C = 1/3.\\n\\nExamples/sanity checks\\n- All-equal case: a_i = 1, i = 1..n. Then Q = n, and we can take A' = A (|A'| = n). Our bound gives |A'| ≥ (1/3) n, which holds (not sharp here, as expected).\\n- Dyadic powers: a_i = 2^i, i=0..m−1. Then any [x,2x] contains at most 2 elements, and Q → 3 as m grows. Our theorem guarantees ≥ 1 element (since (1/3)·Q → 1), and indeed sometimes we can get 2; the upper-bound construction with r>2 shows we cannot guarantee ≥2 in general.\\n\\nWhy the bound is useful here\\n- The quantity Q = S^2/T is the effective support size; the lemma above shows a factor-2 window containing at least a constant fraction (namely 1/3) of this effective size, and that 1/3 is best possible.\\n\\nObstacles resolved and key insight\\n- Initial attempts via coarse dyadic bucketing led to bounds with extra factors (e.g., number of bins). The decisive step was a pairwise decomposition by multiplicative ratio, bounding contributions in each band using both the count cap M on any [x,2x] and the inequality 2ab ≤ a^2 + b^2. Summing geometric tails across far bands yields the exact constant 3.\\n\\nNext steps (optional extensions)\\n- Generalize to windows [x, λx] with λ > 1. The same argument suggests the sharp constant is C(λ) = (λ−1)/(λ+1). Indeed, an r>λ geometric progression gives Q → (r+1)/(r−1) and M = 1, forcing C(λ) ≤ (λ−1)/(λ+1); and the band-sum proof with base λ should give S^2 ≤ ((λ+1)/(λ−1)) M T. Formalizing this would be a natural extension.\\n\\nNotes on output.md\\n- No output.md was provided in this round. I propose recording as a main theorem: The optimal constant is C = 1/3, with the proof sketched above (cleanly structured), and the tightness example via r>2 geometric progressions.\"}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"auto","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"ProverOutput","schema_":{"properties":{"progress_md":{"description":"Append-only progress notes","title":"Progress Md","type":"string"}},"required":["progress_md"],"title":"ProverOutput","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":615,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":27395,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":25920},"total_tokens":28010},"user":null,"store":true}
