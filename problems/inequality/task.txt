I want you to find the best possible constant $C$ such that the following is true. Let $A$ be a set of $n$ positive numbers. We can always choose a subset $A' \subseteq A$ such that 
1.  $2 \min_{a \in A'} a \ge \max_{a \in A'} a$,
2.  $|A'| \ge C \cdot (\sum_{a \in A} a)^2 / (\sum_{a \in A} a^2)$. 

I am interested in any upper bound and lower bound you can provide.
