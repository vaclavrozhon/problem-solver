  "summary_md": "This round establishes the two technical pillars needed for the forward-only, low-complexity theorem. First, a simple double-sum / permutation-coupling bound shows false merges are rare: for an epoch with S starts and F steps, E[X] \u2264 F\u00b7S/(n\u2212F) (specializing to E[X] \u2264 2q^2/n for S,F \u2264 2q). Second, the no-skip event is bounded similarly, so we can couple all starts to a single random start-permutation r with failure O(q^2/n). Third, a functions-specific scale coupling (replacement for graph Claim 6.11) is proved: conditioned on no false merges/no-skip, the single-scale component A_i deterministically finds the same collision as any competing algorithm A up to a constant (factor-4) overhead in forward steps under an older-first tie-break. Assembling these yields an epoch argument: in the regime q\u22c6 = RAC \u2264 \u221an/log^\u03b1 n, each O(q\u22c6 log n)-query epoch succeeds with constant probability, so E[Queries_{A_all}] = O(q\u22c6 log n).

    "Uniform expectation bound for false merges: for S starts and F steps in a window, E[X] \u2264 F\u00b7S/(n\u2212F); in the epoch S,F \u2264 2q this gives E[X] = O(q^2/n) (prover-02).",
    "Alternate simpler double-sum form: E[X] \u2264 (q_step \u00b7 s)/(n\u2212q) \u2264 2 q^2/n for q \u2264 n/2 (prover-01).",
    "No-skip (start-permutation coupling) has the same O(q^2/n) failure probability, enabling coupling to a fixed random Start string r.",
    "Forward-only scale coupling (functions analogue of Claim 6.11): conditioned on no false merges/no-skip and using an older-first tie-break, single-scale A_i finds the same collision as A within a constant (\u22644) factor overhead in forward steps.",
    "Epoch assembly: with Markov and the above conditioning, an 8q\u22c6-round epoch (each round O(log n) queries) succeeds with constant probability when q\u22c6 \u2264 \u221an/log^\u03b1 n, implying E[Queries_{A_all}] = O(q\u22c6 log n).",
    "Techniques are robust to adaptivity and arbitrary f and avoid Freedman/Azuma by using permutation coupling and union bounds."

    "Write fully formal proofs of Lemmas A/1\u20133 with filtrations and a crisp lemma that older-first tie-breaking never increases time-to-first-collision in the function model (explicitly justify the symmetry/exchangeability step).",
    "Tighten constants and the \u03b1 requirement: carry out precise per-walk budget accounting in Lemma 3 to show the minimal \u03b1 (likely \u03b1=1) suffices and reduce the 4/8 overhead factors where possible.",
    "Optionally strengthen tail bounds: replace the Markov-based tail for X by Freedman/Bernstein-style martingale concentration to get exponentially small failure tails and slightly improved epoch success probabilities; then produce the combined polished writeup (output.md)."
