This round establishes the two technical pillars needed for the forward-only, low-complexity theorem. First, a simple double-sum / permutation-coupling bound shows false merges are rare: for an epoch with S starts and F steps, E[X] ≤ F·S/(n−F) (specializing to E[X] ≤ 2q^2/n for S,F ≤ 2q). Second, the no-skip event is bounded similarly, so we can couple all starts to a single random start-permutation r with failure O(q^2/n). Third, a functions-specific scale coupling (replacement for graph Claim 6.11) is proved: conditioned on no false merges/no-skip, the single-scale component A_i deterministically finds the same collision as any competing algorithm A up to a constant (factor-4) overhead in forward steps under an older-first tie-break. Assembling these yields an epoch argument: in the regime q⋆ = RAC ≤ √n/log^α n, each O(q⋆ log n)-query epoch succeeds with constant probability, so E[Queries_{A_all}] = O(q⋆ log n).
