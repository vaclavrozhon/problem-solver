However, there are two critical issues to fix before we can assemble the epoch argument rigorously: (a) Prover 01’s counting bound for false merges uses an incorrect denominator (direction of the inequality is reversed), and (b) Prover 02’s assertion that “skip is exactly a false merge” is false; skip events must be handled separately. The clean permutation-coupling approach in Prover 02, properly stated, fixes (a) and also yields a parallel bound for skips, fixing (b) as well. The single-scale coupling (functions analogue of Claim 6.11) remains a proof sketch and should not yet be added to output.md; it likely needs a precise older-first tie-breaking lemma and careful amortization.\\n\\nDetailed critique and corrections:\\n- False merges (01 vs 02). Prover 01’s Lemma 1 argues that, for a fixed step t and earlier start j, Pr[v_j = f(u_t)] ≤ 1/(n − j + 1). This is not valid: by time of the j-th start, the unseen pool may be much smaller than n − j + 1 due to prior step images, so 1/(n − j + 1) can understate the true probability (counterexample: n=10, j=2, and 7 images already revealed ⇒ the unseen pool size is 2, so the probability a particular unseen w is chosen is 1/2 ≫ 1/9). Prover 02’s permutation-coupling argument correctly conditions on the set of revealed images I_t and shows S_t is uniform among s_t-subsets of W_t := [n] \\\\ I_t; hence Pr[y ∈ S_t | history] = s_t/|W_t| ≤ s_t/(n − F). Summing yields E[X] ≤ F·S/(n − F). This is rigorous under full adaptivity.\\n- Skips are distinct from false merges. A skip occurs when a step lands on a vertex that would have been sampled by a future Start; this is not a false merge (which requires the step to land on a previously started-but-unreached vertex). Prover 02’s identification of the two is incorrect. Fortunately, the same permutation-coupling gives an analogous bound for the expected number of skips: E[SKIP-count] ≤ F·S/(n − F), and hence Pr[SKIP] ≤ F·S/(n − F).\\n- Cycle-closure remark (01) is inaccurate. Stepping into the very first start vertex v_0 can happen (even without loops) and does not automatically yield a collision witness, because v_0 may have had no previously revealed incoming edge. So we should not rely on this shortcut; the overall amortization can proceed without it.\\n- Coupling to a single scale (both 01 and 02). The older-first tie-breaking w.l.o.g. is plausible but needs a crisp lemma: among algorithms differing only by how they choose between isomorphic active walks, older-first does not increase the number of queries to the first collision. Then, the functions-version of Claim 6.11 should explicitly use both no-false-merge and no-skip to synchronize the start indices between A and A_i and to bound the per-walk budgets; the constant factor (claimed 4×) needs a complete accounting.\\n\\nWhat to keep and what to defer:\\n- Keep (and formalize in output.md): the permutation-coupling bounds for false merges and for skips, with precise definitions and a fully rigorous proof. These are uniform over f and adaptive algorithms and are highly valuable.\\n- Defer to notes (not output.md yet): the single-scale coupling and the epoch assembly, pending a full formal proof of the older-first lemma and the amortization details.\\n\\nConcrete next steps for provers:\\n1) Prove the “older-first tie-breaking w.l.o.g.” lemma formally in the forward-only function model using the random-permutation coupling of starts; state it precisely as a stochastic domination or stopping-time monotonicity result.\\n2) Write the full functions-version of Claim 6.11: under no-false-merge and no-skip, A_i finds the same first collision as A with a constant-factor overhead. Provide a precise potential-function or charging argument bounding the total steps A_i spends advancing older walks up to 2^i.\\n3) Assemble the epoch argument using the two rare-event bounds (false merges and skips) via a union bound, and Markov for the A* runtime. Track constants to determine the weakest α for which the success probability per epoch is bounded below by a fixed constant (α>1 likely suffices; optimizing to α≥1 may also be possible).\\n4) Optional: strengthen Markov to a martingale tail (Freedman/Bernstein) for the count processes if tighter constants are desired.\\n\\nThe curated output.md below contains only the rigorously proved false-merge and skip bounds, which are the key probabilistic pillars for the coupling step.\",\"new_notes_md\":\"Setting and goals.\\n- We study forward-only oracle access to a fixed function f:[n]→[n] with no loops (f(v)≠v). The algorithm issues two kinds of queries: Start (returns a uniformly random unseen vertex) and Step (for a previously seen u, reveal f(u)). A collision is found when we have distinct u≠u′ with f(u)=f(u′).\\n- In the forward-only model, a Step may land on a vertex selected earlier by Start but not yet reached by any walk; this is a “false merge” (not a collision). Also, a Step may land on a vertex that would have been selected by a future Start; this is a “skip,” which disrupts coupling to a pre-sampled Start order.\\n- Target theorem (informal): If RAC(collision,f)≤√n / log^α n (low-complexity regime), then the interleaved all-scales algorithm A_all finds a collision in O(log n)·RAC expected queries. We need (i) robust bounds that false merges and skips are rare up to O(√n/polylog n) queries, and (ii) a functions-version of the scale-coupling lemma (analogue of Claim 6.11) plus an epoch assembly argument.\\n\\nKey probabilistic tool: permutation coupling of starts.\\n- Fix an epoch (a time window) in which the algorithm performs S Start operations and F Step operations (S,F arbitrary, adaptive, but finite). Expose a uniform random permutation π of [n]. Implement the Start oracle by always returning the unseen vertex of smallest π-rank. This realizes the uniform new-start oracle and implies that, conditioning on the set I_t of images revealed by steps before time t, the set of started vertices S_t is uniform among all s_t-subsets of W_t:=[n]\\\\I_t, where s_t is the number of starts before t.\\n- For a step at time t with target y:=f(u_t), the conditional probability that y is in the previously-started set is s_t/|W_t| if y∉I_t (and 0 if y∈I_t). Similarly, the conditional probability that y equals one of the vertices that would be selected by future Starts within the epoch is (S−s_t)/|W_t| if y∉I_t (and 0 otherwise). Since |W_t|≥n−F for all t, these yield simple, uniform bounds.\\n\\nConsequences (rigorous; curated into output.md):\\n- Expected number of false merges in the epoch ≤ F·S/(n−F); hence Pr[at least one false merge] ≤ F·S/(n−F).\\n- Expected number of skip events in the epoch ≤ F·S/(n−F); hence Pr[SKIP] ≤ F·S/(n−F).\\n- In particular, for an epoch of ≤2q total queries, with S,F≤2q and q≤n/4, both probabilities are O(q^2/n). This is uniform over f and any adaptive strategy.\\n\\nCaveats and corrections to prior reports.\\n- The union-bound attempt that upper-bounds Pr[v_j=f(u_t)] by 1/(n−j+1) is incorrect, because the unseen pool at the j-th start can be substantially smaller than n−j+1 after many steps, making the true probability larger. The permutation-coupling analysis above addresses this correctly.\\n- Skips are not the same as false merges. A skip occurs when a step lands on a vertex slated to be chosen by a future Start; false merges require landing on a previously started vertex that has not yet been reached by any walk. Both are rare, but they are distinct events and must be bounded separately (both bounds follow from the same coupling).\\n- “Cycle closure always gives an immediate collision” needs a qualification: stepping into the very first start vertex v_0 does not automatically produce two distinct known preimages of v_0. The analysis should not rely on this shortcut.\\n\\nWhat remains to prove for the main theorem.\\n- Older-first tie-breaking w.l.o.g.: State and prove a lemma that among algorithms that differ only by how they choose between isomorphic active walks, choosing the oldest cannot increase the number of queries to the first collision. Use the permutation-coupling to justify exchangeability of unseen start vertices.\\n- Functions-version of the single-scale coupling (analogue of Claim 6.11): Under the joint event {no false merges}∧{no skips}, and conditioning on the first collision occurring along W_j at distance L∈[2^i,2^{i+1}), show that the single-scale process at scale i finds the same collision within a constant-factor (e.g., ≤4×) number of forward steps relative to A’s cost up to the collision. Provide a precise amortization argument that charges A_i’s work to A’s work, carefully accounting for walks that terminate early (due to merging into already-reached vertices or cycle closure).\\n- Epoch assembly: With Markov (Pr[T_A*≤2q*]≥1/2) and the O(q^2/n) bounds above, a single 8q*-round epoch of A_all succeeds with probability ≥1/2−O(q*^2/n); in the regime q*≤√n/log^α n, this is a positive constant. Then a geometric bound yields E[Queries_A_all]=O(q* log n).\\n\\nPointers for future rounds.\\n- Write the older-first lemma and the single-scale coupling with full filtrations and stopping times. Consider a potential equal to the total “budgeted” remaining steps at scale i, and show it decreases at each step of A while A_i lags by at most a constant factor.\\n- If tighter constants are desired, upgrade the Markov control of the no-false-merge/no-skip counts to a Freedman/Bernstein tail bound (increments ≤1, predictable quadratic variation ≈ E[count]).\",\"new_notes_append\":\"True\",\"new_outputs_md\":\"Proved statements so far\\n- Lemma 1 (False merges are rare via permutation coupling). In any forward-only epoch with S starts and F steps, the expected number of false merges is at most F·S/(n−F), and hence Pr[at least one false merge] ≤ F·S/(n−F).\\n- Lemma 2 (Skips are also rare via permutation coupling). In the same epoch, the expected number of skip events is at most F·S/(n−F), and hence Pr[SKIP] ≤ F·S/(n−F).\\n- Corollary 3 (Uniform O(q^2/n) bound in 2q-query epochs). In any epoch with at most 2q total queries (so S,F≤2q) and q≤n/4, both Pr[at least one false merge] and Pr[SKIP] are O(q^2/n), more precisely ≤ 4q^2/(n−2q).\\n\\nProofs\\n\\nPreliminaries and setup. Fix n≥1 and a function f:[n]→[n]. Consider an arbitrary (possibly adaptive) algorithm that issues two types of oracle interactions:\\n- Start: return a uniformly random vertex from the set of unseen vertices; here \\\"unseen\\\" means not yet returned by any Start and not yet revealed as the image of any Step.\\n- Step(u): for a previously seen vertex u, reveal y=f(u); now y becomes seen (if it was not already).\\nFix an arbitrary epoch (time window) during which exactly S Start operations and F Step operations occur (S,F finite; they may be adapted to the history). Write the Step times as t=1,2,…,F in their chronological order within the epoch. Let I_t denote the set of images revealed by Steps strictly before the t-th Step, and let s_t be the number of Starts that occurred strictly before the t-th Step. Let W_t:=[n]\\\\I_t be the set of vertices that have not yet been revealed as images before Step t.\\n\\nWe use the standard permutation coupling for the Start oracle: sample a uniform random permutation π of [n] at the beginning. At each Start, return the unseen vertex with smallest π-rank. This realizes exactly the uniform new-start rule and yields the following fact.\\n\\nFact (Uniform-subset view). Conditional on the history up to just before Step t, in particular on I_t, the set S_t of vertices returned by the s_t Starts so far is distributed as the set of the s_t smallest-π elements of W_t. Equivalently, S_t is uniform among all s_t-subsets of W_t.\\n\\nLemma 1 (False merges are rare).\\nDefinition. A false merge at Step t occurs iff the revealed image y_t:=f(u_t) satisfies y_t∉I_t and y_t∈S_t (i.e., it is a newly revealed image that coincides with a previously started vertex).\\nClaim. E[#false merges in the epoch] ≤ F·S/(n−F). In particular, Pr[at least one false merge] ≤ F·S/(n−F).\\nProof. Fix t. Conditional on the history up to Step t, either y_t∈I_t (then the indicator for a false merge at t is 0) or y_t∉I_t (then y_t∈W_t). By the Uniform-subset view, Pr[y_t∈S_t | history] = s_t/|W_t|. Since |W_t| ≥ n−F for all t (at most F images can be revealed in the entire epoch), we have\\n  Pr[false merge at t | history] ≤ s_t/(n−F).\\nTaking expectations and summing over t=1,…,F gives\\n  E[#false merges] ≤ ∑_{t=1}^F E[s_t/(n−F)] ≤ (1/(n−F)) ∑_{t=1}^F E[s_t] ≤ F·S/(n−F),\\nbecause s_t ≤ S for all t. Finally, Pr[#false merges ≥ 1] ≤ E[#false merges]. This bound holds uniformly over f and over the algorithm’s adaptivity.\\n\\nLemma 2 (Skips are rare).\\nDefinition. Let r_1,r_2,… be the (random) Start sequence defined by the π-coupling: within the epoch, the j-th Start returns r_j. A skip event occurs at Step t if y_t:=f(u_t) satisfies y_t∉I_t and y_t equals one of the vertices that would be returned by a future Start within the epoch, i.e., y_t ∈ R_t where R_t is the set of the next S−s_t smallest-π elements of W_t.\\nClaim. E[#skip events in the epoch] ≤ F·S/(n−F). In particular, Pr[SKIP] ≤ F·S/(n−F).\\nProof. Fix t. Conditional on the history up to Step t, if y_t∈I_t the indicator is 0. Otherwise y_t∈W_t. By symmetry of π, the probability that a fixed y_t lies among the next S−s_t smallest-π elements of W_t equals (S−s_t)/|W_t|. Hence\\n  Pr[skip at t | history] = (S−s_t)/|W_t| ≤ (S−s_t)/(n−F) ≤ S/(n−F).\\nTaking expectations and summing over t yields\\n  E[#skips] ≤ ∑_{t=1}^F E[(S−s_t)/(n−F)] = (1/(n−F)) ∑_{t=1}^F (S−E[s_t]) ≤ F·S/(n−F).\\nFinally, Pr[SKIP] ≤ E[#skips]. This bound is uniform over f and adaptive choices.\\n\\nCorollary 3 (Bounds for 2q-query epochs).\\nSuppose an epoch performs at most 2q total queries, so S,F≤2q, and assume q≤n/4 (so n−2q≥n/2>0). Then Lemmas 1 and 2 give\\n  Pr[at least one false merge] ≤ 4q^2/(n−2q) ≤ 8q^2/n,\\n  Pr[SKIP] ≤ 4q^2/(n−2q) ≤ 8q^2/n.\\nThus, in the low-complexity regime q≪√n, both events occur with vanishing probability O(q^2/n).\\n\\nRemarks.\\n- These bounds require no assumptions on f beyond being a function; they are robust to algorithmic adaptivity and hold for any fixed f.\\n- The same permutation-coupling framework can be used to obtain martingale concentration (e.g., via Freedman) for the counts of false merges and skips if tighter tails are needed; the above expectation/Markov bounds suffice for the intended √n/polylog n regime.\\n\",\"new_outputs_append\":\"True\",\"verdict\":\"success\"}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"auto","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"VerifierNewSchema","schema_":{"properties":{"feedback_md":{"title":"Feedback Md","type":"string"},"new_notes_md":{"title":"New Notes Md","type":"string"},"new_notes_append":{"title":"New Notes Append","type":"string"},"new_outputs_md":{"title":"New Outputs Md","type":"string"},"new_outputs_append":{"title":"New Outputs Append","type":"string"},"verdict":{"title":"Verdict","type":"string"}},"required":["feedback_md","new_notes_md","new_notes_append","new_outputs_md","new_outputs_append","verdict"],"title":"VerifierNewSchema","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":6463,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":16905,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":12992},"total_tokens":23368},"user":null,"store":true}
