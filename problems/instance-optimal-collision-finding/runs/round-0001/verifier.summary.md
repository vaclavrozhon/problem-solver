High-level assessment: There is solid, usable progress on bounding “false merges” in the forward-only model, and a plausible plan for the scale-coupling. However, there are two critical issues to fix before we can assemble the epoch argument rigorously: (a) Prover 01’s counting bound for false merges uses an incorrect denominator (direction of the inequality is reversed), and (b) Prover 02’s assertion that “skip is exactly a false merge” is false; skip events must be handled separately. The clean permutation-coupling approach in Prover 02, properly stated, fixes (a) and also yields a parallel bound for skips, fixing (b) as well. The single-scale coupling (functions analogue of Claim 6.11) remains a proof sketch and should not yet be added to output.md; it likely needs a precise older-first tie-breaking lemma and careful amortization.
