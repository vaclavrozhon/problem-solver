  "summary_md": "Round 0002 constructs two deterministic algorithmic couplings that close the remaining gap for the forward-only functions theorem. First, Lemma OF builds an older-first pacing wrapper B[A,i] that simulates any adaptive A while enforcing older-first up to scale 2^i; each simulated A-step incurs at most one extra B-step, so if A halts by T then B halts by \u22642T, and B never hides a collision A saw. Second, Lemma SC gives a single-scale domination: conditioned on no false-merges/no-skips for both A and the single-scale A_i and on A\u2019s first collision occurring at scale i, A_i finds a collision within \u22644q forward queries via a detailed budget-charging argument comparing B\u2019s work to A_i\u2019s required extensions. Combining these with the permutation-coupling skip/false-merge bounds from output.md yields per-epoch success \u2265 1/2 \u2212 O((q*^2 log n)/n), so in the low-complexity regime q* \u2264 \u221an / log^\u03b1 n with \u03b1 \u2265 1 the total cost is O(q* log n).

    "Both lemmas share the same start-permutation r to align walk indices; coupling relies on no-false-merge \u21d2 disjointness and older-first age-monotonicity.",
    "Epoch assembly: permutation-coupling gives per-epoch failure O((q*^2 log n)/n); for q* \u2264 \u221an / log^\u03b1 n and \u03b1 \u2265 1 this yields constant per-epoch success and overall E[Queries]=O(q* log n).",
    "Cycle-closure is treated as walk termination (no automatic collision); terminations only reduce A_i\u2019s required budget and aid domination."
