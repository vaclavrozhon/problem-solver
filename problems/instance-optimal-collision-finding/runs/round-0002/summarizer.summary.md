Round 0002 constructs two deterministic algorithmic couplings that close the remaining gap for the forward-only functions theorem. First, Lemma OF builds an older-first pacing wrapper B[A,i] that simulates any adaptive A while enforcing older-first up to scale 2^i; each simulated A-step incurs at most one extra B-step, so if A halts by T then B halts by ≤2T, and B never hides a collision A saw. Second, Lemma SC gives a single-scale domination: conditioned on no false-merges/no-skips for both A and the single-scale A_i and on A’s first collision occurring at scale i, A_i finds a collision within ≤4q forward queries via a detailed budget-charging argument comparing B’s work to A_i’s required extensions. Combining these with the permutation-coupling skip/false-merge bounds from output.md yields per-epoch success ≥ 1/2 − O((q*^2 log n)/n), so in the low-complexity regime q* ≤ √n / log^α n with α ≥ 1 the total cost is O(q* log n).
