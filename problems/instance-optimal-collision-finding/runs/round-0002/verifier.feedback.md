High-level assessment
- Both reports converge on a coherent plan: (a) use the permutation-coupling to make skips and false merges rare, and (b) do a single-scale amortization based on an “older-first” invariant to compare an arbitrary competitor A to a single-scale process A_i. The structural Lemma A (no-false-merge ⇒ disjointness) and Lemma B (age-monotone lengths under older-first ties) are sound, clean, and central. The proposed single-scale domination (your Lemma E / Lemma SC) is essentially correct once one conditions on no-skip/no-false-merge and assumes the competitor obeys older-first.

Key correctness issues to fix
1) Symmetrization (Lemma C). As stated (“for any A and any fixed f, there exists A_sym label-invariant with exactly the same expected time on f”), this is generally false. The standard construction yields E[T(A_sym on f)] = E_sigma[E[T(A on sigma∘f∘sigma^{-1})]], i.e., averaging A over random relabelings of the instance. This does not equal E[T(A on f)] for an arbitrary fixed f unless A is already label-invariant. What you can safely claim (and what suffices for our use) is: the optimal expected complexity RAC(collision, f) can be achieved (or arbitrarily closely approximated) by a label-invariant algorithm via symmetrization, because the optimum is invariant across conjugates and the averaging step preserves the optimum. Please adjust the statement accordingly and move the equality claim out of output.md unless fully justified.

2) Older-first w.l.o.g. (Lemma D). The sketch is promising, but it is not yet a proof. The claim that “choosing an older representative never delays the first occurrence (in expectation)” needs a precise filtration and a tie-local exchangeability argument that the hazard of success at the next step is unaffected while the future evolves in a stochastically favorable way. Please provide: (i) a formal statement of the tie events as stopping times; (ii) a proof that the conditional law of the immediate success indicator given the unlabeled state is symmetric across tied candidates; (iii) a coupling showing that, resolving ties by the minimal age index yields a process whose length vector remains majorized at all times, and that this majorization implies an expectation bound on the hitting time. Until this is written, we cannot curate Lemma D in output.md.

3) Pacing wrapper (Lemma OF in report 02). As written, this “simulate A but insert catch-up steps” wrapper is not implementable in the online oracle model: inserting extra steps changes the transcript seen by A, so A’s next choice generally changes, and the claim “B reveals a superset of A’s images up to the collision” is not justified. Do not curate this as a lemma. If you want a wrapper-type argument, it must either (a) be a purely pathwise accounting bound that does not claim implementability, or (b) run A as a black box on a separate stream (impossible without knowing f). The safer route is to complete Lemma D and then apply Lemma B directly.

4) Conditioning on no-skips for both A and A_i. In the single-scale coupling you need both processes to share the same pre-sampled start order r up to the relevant horizon; that requires conditioning on no skips for each process, not only for A. Report 02 already points this out; carry it through consistently.

What is correct and valuable
- Lemma A (no-false-merge ⇒ disjointness and “step-into-seen” is a true collision) is correct. It neatly side-steps the “cycle closure” pitfall in the function setting.
- Lemma B (age-monotone vector under older-first ties) is correct by a simple induction on steps and is exactly the invariant needed for amortization.
- The single-scale domination (your Lemma E / SC) is correct once we assume older-first (either as a property of A or after a validated Lemma D) and condition on no-skips/no-false-merges. In fact the constant can be tightened: a direct accounting shows a 2× bound in step count (see curated Lemma 6), not 3×–4×.
- The permutation-coupling bounds already curated are in good shape and are the right probabilistic inputs. Union bounding across O(log n) scales is fine in the intended regime (α ≥ 1); if desired, Freedman/Bernstein tails can reduce constants and the α-threshold.

Concrete next steps
1) Replace Lemma C with the precise averaged-symmetrization statement and deduce that the optimum RAC(collision,f) is attained (or approached) by a label-invariant algorithm. This is safe to curate.
2) Finish Lemma D rigorously. Suggested approach: define the tie times τ_k (first time with at least two equal-length eligible walks), condition on the unlabeled state at τ_k, use exchangeability to see the next-step collision hazard is invariant across tied choices, then couple two runs (original tie-breaking vs older-first) so that the index chosen under older-first is never younger. Use Lemma B to argue the length vector under older-first is always coordinatewise ≥ the other at tie-length coordinates, and turn that into an expectation bound on hitting time via an additive potential equal to the sum over walks of min{current length, 2^i}.
3) With Lemma D in place, integrate the curated single-scale domination (Lemma 6 below) into the epoch assembly, tracking both step and start counts. State explicitly that the A_all interleaving counts O(log n) queries per round, and that bookkeeping checks for collisions are free.
4) Optional refinement: supply Freedman/Bernstein inequalities for #skips and #false-merges with predictable quadratic variation ≈ F·S/(n−F) to allow α > 1/2 if desired.

Minimal counterexamples/clarifications
- Against the equality form of Lemma C: pick an algorithm that always prioritizes a specific label among tied walks. For a fixed f whose two preimages of a popular image happen to carry those favored labels, E[T(A on f)] can be strictly smaller than the conjugacy-class average E_sigma[T(A on sigma∘f∘sigma^{-1})]. Thus the “same expected time on f” claim fails; only the averaged identity is valid.
- Against the pacing wrapper: a 2-walk toy where A’s next choice depends on the last revealed image shows that inserting a catch-up step can flip A’s next query, so you cannot claim “superset of A’s revealed edges” pathwise.

Curation decisions
- We append to output.md: (i) Lemma A (now Lemma 4) with a complete proof, (ii) Lemma B (now Lemma 5), and (iii) a sharpened single-scale domination lemma under older-first (Lemma 6) with a fully rigorous 2× step-count bound, conditioned on no-skips/no-false-merges for both A and A_i. We keep Lemma C/D/OF/SC as notes until fully formalized.
