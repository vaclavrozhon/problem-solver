High-level assessment
- Both reports converge on a coherent plan: (a) use the permutation-coupling to make skips and false merges rare, and (b) do a single-scale amortization based on an “older-first” invariant to compare an arbitrary competitor A to a single-scale process A_i. The structural Lemma A (no-false-merge ⇒ disjointness) and Lemma B (age-monotone lengths under older-first ties) are sound, clean, and central. The proposed single-scale domination (your Lemma E / Lemma SC) is essentially correct once one conditions on no-skip/no-false-merge and assumes the competitor obeys older-first.
