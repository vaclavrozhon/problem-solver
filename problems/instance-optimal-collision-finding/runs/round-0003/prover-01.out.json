This is uniform over f and adaptivity.\n- Structural consequences under no-false-merge: before the first collision the active walks are disjoint forward paths, and any step landing in the previously Step-seen image set I_t is a true collision (curated Lemma 4).\n- Age-monotone invariant: under older-first tie-breaking, the length vector (by start age) is nonincreasing at all times prior to the first collision (curated Lemma 5).\n- Single-scale domination under older-first: conditioned on no-skips/no-false-merge for both processes, if A\u2019s first collision occurs along W_j at length L \u2208 [2^i,2^{i+1}), then the single-scale process A_i finds a collision within \u2264 2\u00b7t steps where t is the number of Step queries A used up to that moment (curated Lemma 6).\n\nThese ingredients are the forward-only analogue of the graph-side amortization in \u00a76.3 of BGN, contingent on the older-first assumption.\n\n### Corrections and clarifications relative to output.md\n- No changes required to curated Lemmas 1\u20132\u20133\u20134\u20135\u20136. They are consistent and correctly conditioned on no-false-merge and no-skip for both A and A_i.\n- Remaining gap: we still need a rigorous reduction \u201colder-first w.l.o.g.\u201d for the certificate-aided competitor. Until that is in place, the epoch assembly towards Theorem (forward-only, low complexity) uses Lemma 6 only for algorithms that already tie-break older-first.\n\n### New clean lemma (ready to curate next): Symmetrization to label-invariant algorithms\nStatement (precise averaged form). For any randomized algorithm A and any fixed f:[n]\u2192[n], define the symmetrized algorithm A_sym that samples a uniform permutation \u03c3 of [n] at time 0 and simulates A on \u03c3\u2218f\u2218\u03c3^{-1}, undoing \u03c3 in queries/answers. Then for any finite horizon T,\n\\[ \\E[T_{hit}\\wedge T\\;\\text{of}\\;A_{sym}\\;\\text{on}\\;f] \\;=\\; \\E_{\\sigma}\\,\\E[ T_{hit}\\wedge T\\;\\text{of}\\;A\\;\\text{on}\\;\\sigma\\circ f\\circ\\sigma^{-1}]. \\]\nConsequently, since RAC(collision,\u03c3\u2218f\u2218\u03c3^{\u22121}) = RAC(collision,f) for all \u03c3, the infimum defining RAC can be achieved (or arbitrarily approached) within the class of label-invariant algorithms (i.e., those whose decision distribution depends only on the unlabeled state). This is the safe replacement for the incorrect equality \u201cE[T(A_sym on f)] = E[T(A on f)]\u201d (which need not hold for a fixed f).\nWhy useful here. It allows us to restrict attention to label-invariant competitors before addressing tie-breaking, without loss for RAC.\nSketch of proof. Standard: composing with a uniform \u03c3 makes the transcript distribution depend only on unlabeled states; averaging preserves the optimal value since the max over permutations in RAC is invariant under conjugation.\n\n### Toward the older-first w.l.o.g.: a precise plan and a key sub-lemma\nGoal. Show that among label-invariant algorithms, resolving ties older-first does not increase the expected time to the first collision. We outline a filtration-based, exchangeability-driven argument and isolate a checkable sub-lemma.\n\n- Setup. Work under the event E_noFM that no false merges occur before the first collision; by Lemma 4, the walk-system is a disjoint family of forward paths until the first collision. Fix a pre-sampled start order r and condition on E_noSK (for coupling to r). Consider a label-invariant algorithm A; ties occur at stopping times \u03c4 when there are at least two eligible walks with identical current length.\n\n- Exchangeability at ties. Under the symmetrized setting (averaging over \u03c3), conditioned on the unlabeled state just before \u03c4, the multiset of labels assigned to the tied walks is in uniform random order (by label-invariance and \u03c3-randomness). Therefore, the immediate success hazard at the next step (probability that the next Step lands in I_t) is identical for all choices among the tied walks.\n\n- Monotone coupling of tie choices. Define A_old to be A with the sole modification that at each tie it picks the smallest start index among tied walks (\u201colder-first\u201d). We couple A and A_old to share all randomness except at tie indices. At a tie time \u03c4 with tied set T, the conditional law of the immediate success indicator 1{hit at next Step} is the same under both choices. If no success occurs at that step, we progress to the next state. The crucial quantitative direction is to show that, for each fixed scale i, the capped-sum potential\n  \u03a6_i(t) := \u2211_j min{\u2113_j(t), 2^i}\n stochastically dominates under A_old compared to A at all times t prior to the first collision. Intuitively, older-first greedily fills earlier coordinates up to the cap 2^i before advancing younger ones (Lemma 5 guarantees coordinatewise age-monotonicity), so by an exchange argument \u03a6_i cannot decrease when switching a tie choice to the older index. This gives a pathwise (with respect to \u03c3) inequality \u03a6_i^{old}(t) \u2265 \u03a6_i^{A}(t) for all t, and all i.\n\nSub-lemma S (capped-sum dominance at ties). Fix a tie time \u03c4 and a scale i. Let the current equal length be L<2^i (the only interesting case; if L\u22652^i the cap is inactive). Consider two next-step choices: extend the oldest tied index a or a younger tied index b. Denote the capped-sum after this step by \u03a6_i^{(a)} and \u03a6_i^{(b)} respectively. Then \u03a6_i^{(a)} \u2265 \u03a6_i^{(b)} deterministically. Moreover, iterating such local improvements shows that after any finite sequence of tie resolutions, \u03a6_i under older-first dominates \u03a6_i under any other tie-breaking policy, for all i and all times.\nSketch of proof. At a single tie where all tied walks have the same current length L<2^i, incrementing the older one increases the same coordinate that appears earlier in the sum over j ordered by start age; with the cap min(\u00b7,2^i), the increment contribution is 1 regardless of which tied walk is chosen, but future opportunities to accrue additional units before hitting the cap are better preserved on the older indices under older-first. A standard adjacent-swap exchange (bubble-sort) argument formalizes that repeatedly moving mass to older coordinates (without changing total mass and while respecting that increments occur one unit at a time) never decreases the capped sum. We will write this carefully by induction on steps and via adjacent transpositions in the next round.\n\nWhy S helps. Given S, for the particular scale i picked out by A\u2019s first collision, we have for every time t prior to that collision\n  \u03a6_i^{old}(t) \u2265 \u03a6_i^A(t),\n pathwise (for a fixed \u03c3,r). Using the fact that the total number of Step queries of A up to that moment equals \u2211_j \u2113_j(t), we obtain the bound from Lemma 6 for A_old. Thus A_old meets the single-scale overhead guarantee, which is sufficient for the epoch analysis. Combined with the exchangeability of immediate hazards at ties, this shows that E[time-to-first-collision(A_old)] \u2264 E[time-to-first-collision(A)].\n\nStatus. The sub-lemma S is the remaining formal piece; its single-tie version is straightforward, and the multi-step cumulative dominance follows by an adjacent-transposition argument. I will supply the full proof in the next round with a clearly defined partial order and a rigorous exchange.\n\n### Freedman-style tails for skips and false merges (optional refinement)\nLemma (Freedman tail for X). In an epoch with S starts and F steps, define X_false as the false-merge count and X_skip as the skip count. Under the permutation coupling, each increment is a [0,1]-bounded martingale difference with predictable quadratic variation V \u2264 F\u00b7S/(n\u2212F). Therefore, for any \u03bb>0,\n- Pr[X_false \u2212 E X_false \u2265 \u03bb] \u2264 exp(\u2212 \u03bb^2 / (2(V + \u03bb/3))).\n- The same bound holds for X_skip.\nWhy useful. This yields exponentially small tails in the regime F\u00b7S \u226a n, enabling (if needed) a simultaneous high-probability control over all O(log n) scales in a single epoch. It does not change the asymptotic \u03b1-threshold of 1/2 for the union bound over scales (since the union is over O(log n) events), but it tightens constants.\nSketch. Standard application of Freedman\u2019s inequality for martingales with bounded increments. The Doob martingale is obtained by revealing the step-by-step history; the indicator at each Step has bounded conditional variance \u2264 s_t/|W_t|(1\u2212s_t/|W_t|), summing to \u2264 E X_false.\n\n### Parameter check for the epoch assembly (assuming older-first)\n- Let q\u22c6=RAC(collision,f). Picking an optimal certificate-aided older-first, label-invariant competitor A\u22c6, Markov gives Pr[A\u22c6 finishes within 2q\u22c6] \u2265 1/2.\n- Intersect with no-skip/no-false-merge for A\u22c6 over 2q\u22c6 queries: Pr \u2265 1 \u2212 O(q\u22c6^2/n).\n- For the particular scale i at which A\u22c6 first collides, require no-skip/no-false-merge for A_i over 4q\u22c6 queries: Pr \u2265 1 \u2212 O(q\u22c6^2/n). Union over O(log n) scales contributes an additive O((q\u22c6^2 log n)/n).\n- Thus a single 8q\u22c6-round epoch of A_all succeeds with probability at least 1/2 \u2212 O((q\u22c6^2 log n)/n). In the regime q\u22c6 \u2264 \u221an / log^\u03b1 n, this is \u2265 1/3 for large n when \u03b1 > 1/2. Hence E[Queries_{A_all}(f)] = O(q\u22c6 log n).\nRemark. With only the coarser two-event union bound (not unioning over scales), \u03b1 \u2265 1 suffices; with the refined per-scale union bound as above, \u03b1 > 1/2 suffices.\n\n### Small examples and sanity checks\n- Necessity of older-first for the deterministic 2\u00d7 bound. Construct a toy where A starts many walks but advances only the youngest to length L while keeping older ones at length 0. Then (j\u22121)\u00b72^i can greatly exceed t, showing Lemma 6\u2019s amortization fails without older-first.\n- Symmetry of tie hazards. Under the symmetrized setting, at a tie the probability that the chosen step lands in I_t is the same no matter which tied walk is extended; this uses only exchangeability of labels among tied indices.\n\n### Obstacles remaining\n- The rigorous proof of the multi-step capped-sum dominance (Sub-lemma S) and the consequent \u201colder-first w.l.o.g.\u201d Lemma are pending. The plan is to formalize an adjacent-transposition exchange at ties and demonstrate that \u03a6_i is nondecreasing under replacement of any non-oldest tie choice by the oldest, iterated to convergence (older-first).\n- We must keep conditioning consistently on no-skips/no-false-merges for both A and A_i in the single-scale coupling and reflect the O(log n) union bound (already addressed in the parameter check above).\n\n### Next steps\n1) Write the full proof of Sub-lemma S (capped-sum dominance) and the older-first w.l.o.g. Lemma, with explicit filtrations: define tie stopping times \u03c4_k, prove exchangeability at \u03c4_k, and carry out the adjacent-swap argument to show \u03a6_i^{old}(t) \u2265 \u03a6_i^A(t) for all i,t.\n2) Curate the symmetrization lemma (averaged form) into output.md and connect it to the \u201colder-first w.l.o.g.\u201d reduction for RAC.\n3) Finalize the epoch assembly, explicitly quantifying the per-epoch success probability with \u03b1 > 1/2 and constants C in Theorem (forward-only, low complexity).\n4) Optionally, add Freedman tails for skip/false-merge counts to improve constants and support a simultaneous control across all scales in a single epoch.\n"
