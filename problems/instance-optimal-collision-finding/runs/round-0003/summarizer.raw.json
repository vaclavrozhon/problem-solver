(in the conjugacy-averaged sense). Key technical fixes: an averaged symmetrization lemma reduces the competitor to label-invariant algorithms (so we may reason about unlabeled states), and a tie-exchangeability argument (via random relabelings and measure-preserving maps) shows any tie-breaker has the same conjugacy-averaged time-to-collision, so older-first can be assumed. These close the main conceptual gaps needed to apply the age-monotone invariant and single-scale Lemma 6 to the certificate-aided competitor. Combining these with the permutation-coupling bounds on false-merges/skips gives an epoch assembly yielding E[Queries(A_all)]=O(q* log n) in the stated sparse regime; prover-02 records a clean α≥1 threshold with explicit constants, while prover-01 observes that refined per-scale union/Freedman tails could push this toward α>1/2. Remaining formal work: a detailed adjacent-transposition proof of the capped-sum dominance at ties and an explicit adaptive conjugacy construction across multiple ties.
