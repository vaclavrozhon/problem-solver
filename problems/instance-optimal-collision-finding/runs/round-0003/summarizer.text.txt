  "summary_md": "Round 0003 consolidated prerequisites, fixed an earlier symmetrization mistake, and gave a concrete route to assume older-first tie-breaking w.l.o.g. (in the conjugacy-averaged sense). Key technical fixes: an averaged symmetrization lemma reduces the competitor to label-invariant algorithms (so we may reason about unlabeled states), and a tie-exchangeability argument (via random relabelings and measure-preserving maps) shows any tie-breaker has the same conjugacy-averaged time-to-collision, so older-first can be assumed. These close the main conceptual gaps needed to apply the age-monotone invariant and single-scale Lemma 6 to the certificate-aided competitor. Combining these with the permutation-coupling bounds on false-merges/skips gives an epoch assembly yielding E[Queries(A_all)]=O(q* log n) in the stated sparse regime; prover-02 records a clean α≥1 threshold with explicit constants, while prover-01 observes that refined per-scale union/Freedman tails could push this toward α>1/2. Remaining formal work: a detailed adjacent-transposition proof of the capped-sum dominance at ties and an explicit adaptive conjugacy construction across multiple ties.

  "highlights": [
    "Averaged symmetrization lemma (Lemma S): averaging over a uniform conjugacy σ lets one restrict to label-invariant algorithms for the RAC benchmark (fixes an earlier incorrect fixed-f equality).",
    "Tie-breaking invariance (Lemma D): after averaging over σ, the expected time-to-first-collision is unchanged by the tie-breaker; thus older-first may be assumed w.l.o.g. (proof via exchangeability at tie stopping times and measure-preserving relabelings).",
    "Existing building blocks remain valid: false-merges/skips are rare (E[#false merges], E[#skips] ≤ F·S/(n−F), giving Pr[bad]=O(q^2/n) in 2q-query epochs), and Lemmas 5–6 (age-monotone and single-scale 2× domination) still apply under older-first.",
    "Epoch assembly completed up to constants: combining the above yields E[Queries(A_all)]=O(q* log n). Prover-02 gives α≥1 for the clean union-bound regime; prover-01 notes a refined per-scale union (plus Freedman tails) could allow α>1/2.",
    "Optional Freedman-style tails: a martingale argument gives exponential concentration for skip/false-merge counts (variance ≤ F·S/(n−F)), useful to tighten constants and support simultaneous control over scales.",
    "Remaining formal gaps: (i) full multi-step capped-sum dominance (Sub-lemma S) via adjacent-transpositions; (ii) an explicit, adaptive measure-preserving relabeling construction across successive ties (to be written out)."

    "Write an explicit adaptive construction of the measure-preserving conjugacy maps used in Lemma D (one per tie) and prove by induction that they preserve the unlabeled history and the relabeled-run distribution up to collision.",
    "Optional but desirable: integrate Freedman tails into the epoch assembly, quantify constants precisely, and resolve whether the α threshold can be reduced from ≥1 to >1/2 in the final theorem."
