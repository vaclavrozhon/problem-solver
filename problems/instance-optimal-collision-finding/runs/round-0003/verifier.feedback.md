High-level assessment. Both reports push on the two key missing reductions: (i) a correct symmetrization/label-invariance reduction, and (ii) an older-first tie-breaking reduction. The symmetrization lemma (averaged over conjugacy) is sound and should be curated. The proposed “older-first w.l.o.g.” claims, however, are not yet rigorous; Prover 02’s equality-in-expectation statement is particularly suspect. I also found a concrete flaw in the currently curated Lemma 6: the single-scale A_i was defined to cap each walk at 2^i steps, but the proof subsequently allows up to 2^{i+1}−1 steps on W_j, exceeding the cap. This inconsistency must be fixed or the lemma removed. I recommend removing Lemma 6 from output.md for now and reintroducing a corrected version once the single-scale schedule and proof are fully consistent.

On Prover 02’s “tie-breaking invariance” (Lemma D). The idea—average over conjugacy, argue exchangeability at ties, and conclude that tie-breaking does not affect the expected time—is not proved. Equal one-step hazards at a tie do not imply equality of entire hitting-time distributions, because different tie-breaking choices change the evolution of lengths and thus future hazards. The sketch appeals to measure-preserving maps on the conjugacy σ, adaptively composed at successive ties. Making these maps well-defined and measure-preserving while conditioning on the unlabeled filtration and the evolving set of revealed labels is delicate; ties at later times involve endpoints whose labels have been partially constrained by earlier reveals, and the “disjointness” used at one tie need not persist across ties. This argument needs a formal inductive construction of such maps with explicit sigma-algebra bookkeeping. Until then, the equality claim should not be curated.

On Prover 01’s route via a capped-sum potential (Sub-lemma S). This looks promising: show that, at each tie with common length L<2^i, choosing the older index does not decrease the capped potential Φ_i(t)=∑_j min{ℓ_j(t),2^i}, and that iterating local exchanges yields Φ_i^{old}(t) ≥ Φ_i^A(t) pathwise for all t. That kind of exchange/majorization argument is standard and seems provable. However, by itself it does not yet imply that older-first has smaller or equal expected time to collision. A second ingredient is needed to connect larger Φ_i to a provable advantage in time-to-collision. One standard way is the BGN-style amortization: for the specific scale i of A’s collision, a “single-scale” schedule should force success in O(t) steps, where t is A’s work up to its collision. But this brings us to the inconsistency in Lemma 6.

On single-scale domination (Lemma 6). As curated, A_i caps each walk at 2^i steps, yet the proof allocates up to 2^{i+1}−1 steps on W_j. This cannot be correct as stated. A plausible fix is to redesign the single-scale comparator to allow a controlled second “half-cap” on exactly one walk (or to use a two-phase schedule that does not re-advance older walks in the second phase). Any such redesign must be specified in advance (not depending on the run of A) and proved to detect a collision within ≤ C·t steps under the no-skip/no-false-merge conditions. Without this correction the lemma should not remain in output.md.

On tails and parameters. The Freedman tail bound for skip/false-merge counts is fine and can be curated; it is a clean by-product of the permutation coupling with bounded increments and predictable variance V≤F·S/(n−F). However, it does not materially improve the exponent in the regime q≲√n/polylog n; the main asymptotic threshold for a per-epoch constant success probability, after union bounding across O(log n) scales, is α>1/2 already with our expectation-level bounds. Prover 01’s “α>1/2” check is correct; Prover 02’s “α≥1” is conservative but not tight.

Action items and next steps.
- Remove Lemma 6 from output.md for now; reinsert a corrected “single-scale comparator” lemma once the schedule is coherently defined (e.g., a two-phase, label-invariant schedule that avoids re-expanding older walks in phase 2) and the proof is complete.
- Curate the correct symmetrization lemma (averaged over conjugacy) into output.md; it is solid and needed for reducing to label-invariant competitors.
- Prove Sub-lemma S rigorously. Define the tie stopping times τ_k, fix a scale i, and carry out an adjacent-transposition exchange that shows Φ_i is maximized by older-first. Articulate a clear partial order or majorization argument.
- Decide on a precise older-first reduction: either (a) prove tie-breaking invariance under conjugacy (Prover 02’s route) with a fully formal, measure-preserving mapping across σ’s at each tie; or (b) prove that transforming any label-invariant base policy to older-first multiplies the expected query complexity by at most a universal constant, using the Φ_i domination plus a corrected single-scale lemma.
- Once (older-first w.l.o.g. + corrected single-scale) are in place, finalize the epoch assembly using α>1/2 and provide explicit constants.

Please ensure all future statements that enter output.md come with complete proofs and consistent algorithm definitions (no implicit second pass unless it is part of the formal schedule).
