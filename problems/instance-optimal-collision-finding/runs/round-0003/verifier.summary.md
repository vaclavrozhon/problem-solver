High-level assessment. Both reports push on the two key missing reductions: (i) a correct symmetrization/label-invariance reduction, and (ii) an older-first tie-breaking reduction. The symmetrization lemma (averaged over conjugacy) is sound and should be curated. The proposed “older-first w.l.o.g.” claims, however, are not yet rigorous; Prover 02’s equality-in-expectation statement is particularly suspect. I also found a concrete flaw in the currently curated Lemma 6: the single-scale A_i was defined to cap each walk at 2^i steps, but the proof subsequently allows up to 2^{i+1}−1 steps on W_j, exceeding the cap. This inconsistency must be fixed or the lemma removed. I recommend removing Lemma 6 from output.md for now and reintroducing a corrected version once the single-scale schedule and proof are fully consistent.
