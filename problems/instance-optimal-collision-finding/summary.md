This round establishes the two technical pillars needed for the forward-only, low-complexity theorem. First, a simple double-sum / permutation-coupling bound shows false merges are rare: for an epoch with S starts and F steps, E[X] ≤ F·S/(n−F) (specializing to E[X] ≤ 2q^2/n for S,F ≤ 2q). Second, the no-skip event is bounded similarly, so we can couple all starts to a single random start-permutation r with failure O(q^2/n). Third, a functions-specific scale coupling (replacement for graph Claim 6.11) is proved: conditioned on no false merges/no-skip, the single-scale component A_i deterministically finds the same collision as any competing algorithm A up to a constant (factor-4) overhead in forward steps under an older-first tie-break. Assembling these yields an epoch argument: in the regime q⋆ = RAC ≤ √n/log^α n, each O(q⋆ log n)-query epoch succeeds with constant probability, so E[Queries_{A_all}] = O(q⋆ log n).

## round-0002 — model summary — 2025-08-27T16:02:27.826869Z
Round 0002 constructs two deterministic algorithmic couplings that close the remaining gap for the forward-only functions theorem. First, Lemma OF builds an older-first pacing wrapper B[A,i] that simulates any adaptive A while enforcing older-first up to scale 2^i; each simulated A-step incurs at most one extra B-step, so if A halts by T then B halts by ≤2T, and B never hides a collision A saw. Second, Lemma SC gives a single-scale domination: conditioned on no false-merges/no-skips for both A and the single-scale A_i and on A’s first collision occurring at scale i, A_i finds a collision within ≤4q forward queries via a detailed budget-charging argument comparing B’s work to A_i’s required extensions. Combining these with the permutation-coupling skip/false-merge bounds from output.md yields per-epoch success ≥ 1/2 − O((q*^2 log n)/n), so in the low-complexity regime q* ≤ √n / log^α n with α ≥ 1 the total cost is O(q* log n).

## round-0003 — model summary — 2025-08-27T18:51:10.895802Z
Round 0003 consolidated prerequisites, fixed an earlier symmetrization mistake, and gave a concrete route to assume older-first tie-breaking w.l.o.g. (in the conjugacy-averaged sense). Key technical fixes: an averaged symmetrization lemma reduces the competitor to label-invariant algorithms (so we may reason about unlabeled states), and a tie-exchangeability argument (via random relabelings and measure-preserving maps) shows any tie-breaker has the same conjugacy-averaged time-to-collision, so older-first can be assumed. These close the main conceptual gaps needed to apply the age-monotone invariant and single-scale Lemma 6 to the certificate-aided competitor. Combining these with the permutation-coupling bounds on false-merges/skips gives an epoch assembly yielding E[Queries(A_all)]=O(q* log n) in the stated sparse regime; prover-02 records a clean α≥1 threshold with explicit constants, while prover-01 observes that refined per-scale union/Freedman tails could push this toward α>1/2. Remaining formal work: a detailed adjacent-transposition proof of the capped-sum dominance at ties and an explicit adaptive conjugacy construction across multiple ties.
