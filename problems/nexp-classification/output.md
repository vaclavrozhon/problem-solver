Main results (current)
- We give a NEXPTIME algorithm (in N=poly(β)) that decides, for β‑normalized radius‑1 LCLs on globally oriented paths, whether the LOCAL complexity is O(log* n) or Θ(n). The algorithm guesses a type‑based separator function and verifies it by exponentially many constant‑size Boolean matrix checks over the reachable transfer‑matrix types of length K or K+1.
- To complete the full trichotomy (O(1) vs Ω(log* n) vs Ω(n)) within NEXPTIME, it remains to prove a compression lemma that reduces per‑word periodic witnesses to an exponential per‑type certificate verifiable via matrix/automata checks. We outline this plan in the notes and are working toward a formal proof.
