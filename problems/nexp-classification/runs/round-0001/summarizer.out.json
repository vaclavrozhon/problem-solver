  "summary_md": "Round summary: Developed a transfer-matrix/types framework for \u03b2\u2011normalized, radius\u20111 LCLs on globally oriented paths. Define M(w)=S_{i1}\u00b7E\u00b7S_{i2}\u00b7E\u00b7\u2026 (Boolean \u03b2\u00d7\u03b2 matrices); types are reachable M(w) (|T| \u2264 2^{\u03b2^2}) and obey composition/replacement lemmas. Using this, gave a NEXPTIME procedure for the middle gap (O(log* n) vs \u0398(n):) nondeterministically guess a type\u2011based separator table f_type : T\u00d7{00,01,10,11}\u00d7T \u2192 \u03a3_out^2 and verify local validity + bridge conditions over \u03c4_b,\u03c4_c \u2208 R_K\u222aR_{K+1} by Boolean matrix checks (EXPTIME verification \u21d2 NEXPTIME overall). The remaining top gap (O(1) vs \u03a9(log* n)) is left open: need a compression lemma to reduce the usual doubly\u2011exponential per\u2011word periodic witness to an exponential per\u2011type certificate verifiable by the same automata/matrix methods.

  "highlights": [
    "Introduced transfer\u2011matrix types M(w) (\u03b2\u00d7\u03b2 Boolean) with composition M(P\u00b7Q)=M_P\u00b7E\u00b7M_Q and replacement lemma; reachable type set T computable (|T|\u22642^{\u03b2^2}).",
    "Defined f_type: T\u00d7{00,01,10,11}\u00d7T\u2192\u03a3_out^2 and a bridge matrix B(\u03c4_b,\u03c4_c)=E\u00b7M_{\u03c4_b}\u00b7E\u00b7M_{\u03c4_c}\u00b7E; existence \u21d4 O(log* n) algorithm by labeling length\u20112 separators and filling K/K+1 gaps.",
    "Constructed NEXPTIME decision for O(log* n) vs \u0398(n): build T,R_K,R_{K+1} (EXPTIME), nondeterministically guess exponential f_type, verify all constraints in EXPTIME.",
    "Complexity accounting: building and checking use 2^{O(\u03b2^2)}\u00b7poly(\u03b2) time; guessed witness size exponential in \u03b2, so overall NEXPTIME in input length N=poly(\u03b2).",
    "Top gap (O(1) vs \u03a9(log* n)) remains unsettled; proposed route is a compression lemma converting per\u2011word periodic witnesses (2\u2011EXP domain) into exponential per\u2011type certificates via monoid/idempotent periodicity and per\u2011type admissible cycles."

  "next_questions": [
    "Implement/build the type automaton T and R_K,R_{K+1} and code the EXPTIME verifier for f_type; run on small \u03b2 instances to confirm practicality.",
    "Formalize per\u2011type admissible periodic output sets (via monoid generated by F_i=E\u00b7S_i) and attempt the compression lemma: show any O(1) witness admits an exponential per\u2011type certificate.",
    "Handle edge cases and complete correctness proofs: sparse/degenerate E, forced S_i, and ensure all automata/inclusion checks stay within EXPTIME so the overall algorithm is NEXPTIME."
