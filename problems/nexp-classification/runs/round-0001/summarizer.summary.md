Round summary: Developed a transfer-matrix/types framework for β‑normalized, radius‑1 LCLs on globally oriented paths. Define M(w)=S_{i1}·E·S_{i2}·E·… (Boolean β×β matrices); types are reachable M(w) (|T| ≤ 2^{β^2}) and obey composition/replacement lemmas. Using this, gave a NEXPTIME procedure for the middle gap (O(log* n) vs Θ(n):) nondeterministically guess a type‑based separator table f_type : T×{00,01,10,11}×T → Σ_out^2 and verify local validity + bridge conditions over τ_b,τ_c ∈ R_K∪R_{K+1} by Boolean matrix checks (EXPTIME verification ⇒ NEXPTIME overall). The remaining top gap (O(1) vs Ω(log* n)) is left open: need a compression lemma to reduce the usual doubly‑exponential per‑word periodic witness to an exponential per‑type certificate verifiable by the same automata/matrix methods.
