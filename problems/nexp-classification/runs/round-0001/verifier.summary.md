We unified all provers’ approaches around transfer‑matrix types for radius‑1 oriented paths and wrote rigorous proofs for composition, replacement, and an EXPTIME‑verifiable type‑based feasible function. We corrected a completeness issue by restricting bridge checks to types realized at lengths K or K+1 (the lengths used by the decomposition). This yields a NEXPTIME algorithm for deciding O(log* n) vs Θ(n). The O(1) vs Ω(log* n) step remains pending a compression lemma to turn per‑word periodic witnesses into per‑type exponential certificates; we outlined a concrete monoid/idempotent plan to finish it.
