{"summary_md":"Round summary (last round): Introduced a transfer‑matrix type framework for β‑normalized radius‑1 LCLs on oriented paths: M(w)=S_{i1}·E·S_{i2}·E·… (Boolean β×β). Proved composition and replacement lemmas; built the reachable type set T (|T|≤2^{β^2}) and length‑filtered sets R_K,R_{K+1}. Gave a NEXPTIME procedure for the middle gap (O(log* n) vs Θ(n):) by nondeterministically guessing an exponential‑size type table f_type:T×{00,01,10,11}×T→Σ_out^2 and verifying local + bridge constraints B(τ_b,τ_c)=E·M_{τ_b}·E·M_{τ_c}·E over τ_b,τ_c∈R_K∪R_{K+1} in EXPTIME. The top gap (O(1) vs Ω(log* n)) remains open: a naive per‑type loop test fails (parity counterexample). Plan: extract per‑type residue/idempotent information from the monoid ⟨E·S_0,E·S_1⟩ to produce an exponential per‑type certificate and prove a compression lemma.
