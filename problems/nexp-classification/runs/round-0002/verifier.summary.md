We validated the matrix/type framework and finalized a rigorous NEXPTIME procedure for O(log* n) vs Θ(n), with the critical correction to restrict gap types to lengths K or K+1. For O(1) vs Ω(log* n), the proposed per‑type loop‑set test is not sufficient (parity counterexamples). Partial progress includes a necessary stabilizer test and a sufficient SCC‑constant certificate. Next, incorporate residue/aperiodicity (idempotents of the type monoid) to craft an exponential per‑type certificate and a completeness proof, yielding a full NEXPTIME trichotomy.
