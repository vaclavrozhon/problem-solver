{"summary_md":"Last round developed a transfer‑matrix/types framework for β‑normalized radius‑1 LCLs on oriented paths: for an input word w define M(w)=S_{i1}·E·S_{i2}·E·… (Boolean β×β). Proved composition and replacement lemmas; built the reachable type set T (|T|≤2^{β^2}) and length‑filtered sets R_K,R_{K+1}. Using these, gave a NEXPTIME procedure for the middle gap (O(log* n) vs Θ(n)) by nondeterministically guessing an exponential type table f_type:T×{00,01,10,11}×T→Σ_out^2 and verifying bridge constraints B(τ_b,τ_c)=E·M_{τ_b}·E·M_{τ_c}·E over τ_b,τ_c∈R_K∪R_{K+1} in EXPTIME. The O(1) vs Ω(log* n) case remains open: naive per‑type loop tests fail (parity counterexample). Proposed fix: use the monoid ⟨E·S_0,E·S_1⟩, extract idempotents/aperiodic SCC anchors and residue coverage (Wielandt bounds) to form an exponential, EXPTIME‑verifiable certificate; need a compression/extraction lemma to complete full NEXPTIME trichotomy.
