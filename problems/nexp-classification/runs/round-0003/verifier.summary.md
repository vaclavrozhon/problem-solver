Middle-gap verifier is finalized: NEXPTIME via a type-based separator table with checks restricted to K/K+1-length types. For O(1), we corrected the earlier flaw by introducing an aperiodicity (period-1 SCC) criterion on A_τ=M_τ·E and a precise, EXPTIME-checkable sufficient certificate (entry/exit/cross-edge checks). This blocks parity false positives. The extraction/compression lemma to complete the top gap remains open.
