This convention avoids seam E-factors and is convenient for \u201cperiod m\u201d reasoning on long periodic blocks.\n- Middle-gap decision (O(log* n) vs \u0398(n)) is finalized: nondeterministically guess f_type: T\u00d7{00,01,10,11}\u00d7T\u2192\u03a3_out^2; verify local constraints and the scalar bridge (under the length filter \u03c4_b,\u03c4_c\u2208R_K\u222aR_{K+1}) with constant-size Boolean matrix products. Verification is EXPTIME; the overall procedure is NEXPTIME.\n- Top-gap (O(1) vs \u03a9(log* n)): add two EXPTIME-checkable pieces toward a full certificate.\n  (A) Necessary aperiodicity: if some reachable period type \u03c4 has index of imprimitivity d(\u03c4)>1, then \u03a9(log* n).\n  (B) Sufficient \u201cSCC-constant\u201d certificate: if every SCC C of the type automaton admits a constant output x_C (allowed by both S_0,S_1 and with E[x_C,x_C]=1), and some f_type passes the middle-gap check, then O(1).\n  Additionally, we state an \u201ceventual diagonal\u201d lemma and a residue computation routine that will be the backbone for a more general sufficient certificate based on anchors in aperiodic SCCs.\n\nRigorous lemmas and proofs\n\nLemma 1 (replacement; radius 1).\nLet F_i := E\u00b7S_i and T_w := \u220f F_{i_j}. Two input segments P,Q with T_P=T_Q are interchangeable: in any larger instance, replacing P by Q preserves extendibility and the labeling outside. Moreover, concatenation satisfies T_{uv}=T_u\u00b7T_v.\nProof. In radius 1, the observable interface of a segment is the Boolean relation mapping its left boundary output to its right boundary output; this is exactly T_w. Equal relations yield identical extendibility. Composition follows by construction of T.\n\nLemma 2 (middle-gap decision; NEXPTIME).\nLet T be the reachable type set found by BFS from I under \u03b4(M,i)=M\u00b7F_i, and K:=|T|. Let R_\u2113 be the set of types realized by exactly \u2113 inputs (R_{\u2113+1}={M\u00b7F_i: M\u2208R_\u2113, i\u2208{0,1}}). Guess f_type: T\u00d7{00,01,10,11}\u00d7T\u2192\u03a3_out^2. Verify:\n(i) Locality: for each (\u03c4_L,S,\u03c4_R) and (x,y)=f_type(\u03c4_L,S,\u03c4_R), S[1] allows x, E[x,y]=1, and S[2] allows y.\n(ii) Bridge: for all \u03c4_b,\u03c4_c\u2208R_K\u222aR_{K+1} and S1,S2, with f_type(\u00b7,S1,\u03c4_b)=(\u2113_1,\u2113_2), f_type(\u03c4_c,S2,\u00b7)=(r_1,r_2), we have (E\u00b7M_{\u03c4_b}\u00b7E\u00b7M_{\u03c4_c}\u00b7E)[\u2113_2,r_1]=1 (equivalently under F_i: (T_{\u03c4_b}\u00b7T_{\u03c4_c}\u00b7E)[\u2113_2,r_1]=1).\nIf some f_type passes, the LCL is O(log* n); else \u0398(n). Verification is EXPTIME in \u03b2; the algorithm is NEXPTIME.\n\nLemma 3 (eventual diagonal; graph-theoretic periodicity).\nLet A be a Boolean adjacency matrix of a finite directed graph G and v a node in an SCC H. The set L(v):={m\u22650: (A^m)[v,v]=1} is ultimately periodic with period equal to gcd of all directed cycle lengths in H. In particular, there exists N such that (A^m)[v,v]=1 for all m\u2265N if and only if H is aperiodic (gcd=1).\nProof sketch. Classical: in a strongly connected digraph, lengths of closed walks at a vertex form an ultimately periodic set whose period equals the index of imprimitivity (gcd of cycle lengths). This is the Boolean analogue of the Perron\u2013Frobenius theory and follows from decomposition of walks by elementary cycles plus Frobenius normal form. Computation of the gcd per SCC is standard by DFS computing back-edge lengths; the threshold N can be bounded (e.g., Wielandt\u2019s bound) and found by dynamic programming on the SCC (we only need its existence for correctness; algorithmically, periodicity/residue membership is computable in time poly(\u03b2)).\n\nLemma 4 (aperiodicity necessary for O(1)).\nSuppose there exists a reachable primitive word w (|w|\u22651) with type \u03c4 and the SCCs of the adjacency graph of T_w contain only components with period d(\u03c4)>1. Then the deterministic LOCAL complexity is \u03a9(log* n).\nProof. Consider inputs that are long repetitions w^m (arbitrarily large m). A radius-r algorithm sees a radius-r window that repeats with period |w|, hence its output is periodic with some period p depending only on local views. Fix any anchor output x at the block boundary. To close the boundary after m periods with no global coordination, we need (T_w^m)[x,x]=1 for all sufficiently large m. By Lemma 3, L(x) is ultimately periodic with period d(\u03c4)>1; hence some residue class has no solutions. An adversary picks m in this forbidden residue class; the local algorithm cannot produce a legal labeling (boundary cannot close at both ends). Therefore deterministic O(1) is impossible. As the problem is solvable in sublinear time only if an MIS-like global symmetry breaking happens, the standard Naor\u2013Stockmeyer lower bound implies \u03a9(log* n).\n\nLemma 5 (SCC-constant certificate; sufficient for O(1)).\nLet \ud835\udd04 be the type automaton on T with \u03b4(M,i)=M\u00b7F_i. Assume there exists an f_type passing Lemma 2\u2019s verification, and for every SCC C in \ud835\udd04 there is x_C\u2208\u03a3_out with E[x_C,x_C]=1 and S_i[x_C,x_C]=1 for every i labeling some edge of C. Then there is an O(1)-round algorithm.\nProof. Use the (L_width,L_count,L_pattern)-partition (paper) with L_width=L_pattern=|T|, L_count=2|T|+2. For each long periodic subpath in an SCC C, label all nodes by x_C (radius-1 local consistency holds). Label length-2 separators using f_type and fill remaining O(1)-sized gaps by the middle-gap lemma. Total time O(1).\n\nExamples\n\n- Parity obstruction: \u03a3_out={a,b}, E is the 2-cycle a\u2194b, and S_0=S_1=I. For any w, T_w is the 2-cycle adjacency (period 2), so Lemma 4 applies. Known \u0398(log* n) lower bound is recovered.\n- Trivial O(1): E complete (including self-loops) and S_0=S_1=I. Then every SCC is aperiodic (d=1), the SCC-constant certificate holds with any x_C, and f_type exists; we get O(1).\n- 3-cycle: E is a\u2192b\u2192c\u2192a, S_0=S_1=I. Then every T_w has period 3 and Lemma 4 rejects O(1); the problem is \u03a9(log* n).\n\nAlgorithmic side-effects (EXPTIME routines)\n\n- For each \u03c4\u2208T, compute the SCC decomposition of the directed graph of T_\u03c4 and d(\u03c4)=gcd of cycle lengths per SCC. If \u2203\u03c4 with d(\u03c4)>1, we can safely conclude not O(1) (necessary condition).\n- For SCC-constant sufficiency, check for each SCC C a witness x_C with E[x_C,x_C]=1 and S_i[x_C,x_C]=1 for all i appearing on edges in C. This is poly(\u03b2) per SCC. Combine with a guessed f_type passing Lemma 2 to certify O(1).\n\nObstacles\n\n- Lemma 4 is only a necessary condition; some O(1) problems pass aperiodicity but still need non-constant periodic outputs. Extending Lemma 5 to a full sufficient certificate requires handling anchors in aperiodic SCCs with entry/exit witnesses and residue-robust bridges. Lemma 3 suggests the right framework (eventual diagonals), but we must formalize a bounded-size interface table that is independent of m and verifiable in EXPTIME.\n- Endpoint/seam accounting: our T_w convention removes explicit seam E-factors across periods. For interfacing long blocks with separators, we must keep careful track of the E at the separator\u2013block seam. This is naturally handled by multiplying a fixed E on the left/right in the bridge checks.\n\nNext steps\n\n1) Implement T and the middle-gap verifier; include computation of R_K,R_{K+1} and exhaustive bridge checks.\n2) Add to proofs.md: a detailed proof of Lemmas 3\u20135, including a formal reduction from periodic inputs to residue constraints (Lemma 4) and the O(1) algorithm from Lemma 5.\n3) Develop the general \u201caperiodic-anchor\u201d sufficient certificate: for each \u03c4 choose x_\u03c4 in an aperiodic SCC of T_\u03c4, precompute entry/exit witnesses of bounded length that allow reaching/leaving x_\u03c4; show that for all m\u2265M(\u03c4) the diagonals close. Combine with a small separator table; verify all bridges via fixed products. All components are EXPTIME-checkable.\n4) Test on small \u03b2 instances: parity, 3-cycles, and mixed graphs to observe acceptance/rejection by the necessary/sufficient filters and refine the interface conditions.\n"
