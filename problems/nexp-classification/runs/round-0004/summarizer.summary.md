Last round: developed a transfer‑matrix/types framework for β‑normalized radius‑1 LCLs on oriented paths. For each input segment w define M(w)=S_{i1}·E·S_{i2}·E·… (Boolean β×β); proved composition and replacement lemmas and built the reachable type set T (|T|≤2^{β^2}) and length‑filtered sets R_K,R_{K+1}. Using types, gave a NEXPTIME procedure for the middle gap (O(log* n) vs Θ(n)): nondeterministically guess an exponential table f_type:T×{00,01,10,11}×T→Σ_out^2 and verify local + bridge matrix checks (E·M_{τ_b}·E·M_{τ_c}·E) over τ_b,τ_c∈R_K∪R_{K+1} in EXPTIME. The O(1) vs Ω(log* n) case needs a compression/extraction lemma: naive per‑type loop tests fail (parity counterexample). Proposed fix: require aperiodic (period‑1) SCC anchors in A_τ:=M_τ·E and use Wielandt bounds to obtain eventual closure; supply entry/exit witnesses and cross‑edges to form an EXPTIME‑checkable exponential certificate. Remaining tasks: prove stub‑surgery and compression lemmas to extract such a certificate from any O(1) algorithm and finish the NEXPTIME trichotomy.
