Middle-gap NEXPTIME decision is finalized (type-based separator table with checks over K/K+1-length types). For O(1), we now have an EXPTIME sufficient certificate using aperiodic SCC anchors and bounded entry/exit witnesses, plus a necessary aperiodicity filter; parity false positives are avoided. The remaining blocker is a compression lemma (and a precise stub-surgery lemma) to make the O(1) branch a full decision, not just sufficient.
