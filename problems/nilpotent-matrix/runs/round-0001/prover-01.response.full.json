With E the subdiagonal ones, F the superdiagonal ones, and D = diag(z_1,...,z_n), our matrix is M = D + E \u2212 F. One checks [H,E] = E, [H,F] = \u2212F, [H,D] = 0, hence [H,M] = E + F.\\n- The given condition \u2211_{i=1}^n i z_i = 0 is exactly tr(HM) = 0. Nilpotency would also force tr(M) = 0 and more Newton identities. Exploit trace/commutator identities and explicit combinatorics of this tridiagonal pattern.\\n- Corner-entry rigidity: the (1,n) and (n,1) entries of M^{n-1} are independent of z\u2019s. This provides rigid constraints when combined with nilpotency (M^n = 0) and commutators with H. Try to squeeze a contradiction with tr(HM)=0.\\n\\nElementary lemmas (rigorous)\\n\\nLemma 1 (grading identities).\\nLet H = diag(1,2,...,n), E = (e_{i+1,i})_{i=1}^{n-1}, F = (e_{i,i+1})_{i=1}^{n-1}, and D = diag(z_1,...,z_n). Then [H,E] = E, [H,F] = \u2212F, [H,D] = 0. Consequently, for M = D + E \u2212 F, we have [H,M] = E + F.\\nProof. Straightforward on basis vectors: E e_i = e_{i+1}, F e_i = e_{i-1}, and H e_i = i e_i.\\n\\nLemma 2 (similarity flow).\\nDefine M(t) = e^{tH} M e^{\u2212tH}. Then M(t) = D + e^{t} E \u2212 e^{\u2212t} F. In particular M(t) is similar to M, so they have the same characteristic polynomial. Also d/dt|_{t=0} M(t) = [H,M] = E + F.\\n\\nLemma 3 (vanishing traces with [H,M]).\\nFor any k \u2265 0, tr([H,M] M^{k}) = 0. In particular tr((E+F) M^{k}) = 0.\\nProof. tr([H,M] M^{k}) = tr(HM^{k+1}) \u2212 tr(M H M^{k}) = 0 by cyclicity.\\n\\nLemma 4 (trace of M^2; necessary condition for nilpotency).\\nFor interior 2 \u2264 i \u2264 n\u22121, (M^2)_{ii} = z_i^2 \u2212 2; for i = 1,n, (M^2)_{ii} = z_i^2 \u2212 1. Hence tr(M^2) = \u2211_{i=1}^n z_i^2 \u2212 2(n\u22121). If M is nilpotent, tr(M^2) = 0, so \u2211_{i=1}^n z_i^2 = 2(n\u22121).\\nProof. Compute (M^2)_{ii} = \u2211_k M_{ik} M_{ki}; only k \u2208 {i\u22121,i,i+1} contribute, with products 1\u00b7(\u22121) and (\u22121)\u00b71 on off-diagonals.\\n\\nLemma 5 (corner entries of M^{n\u22121}).\\nWe have (M^{n\u22121})_{1n} = (\u22121)^{n\u22121} and (M^{n\u22121})_{n1} = 1, independent of z\u2019s.\\nProof. Decompose M = D + E \u2212 F into homogeneous \u201cgrades\u201d with respect to ad_H. The (1,n) entry has grade 1\u2212n = \u2212(n\u22121). The only way to achieve this total grade in the product of n\u22121 copies of M is to take the grade \u22121 component (\u2212F) at each factor; any D (grade 0) or E (grade +1) would raise the grade above \u2212(n\u22121). Thus (M^{n\u22121})_{1n} = (\u22121)^{n\u22121}(F^{n\u22121})_{1n} = (\u22121)^{n\u22121}. Similarly, for (n,1) one must choose E at each factor.\\n\\nLemma 6 (a fixed entry of [H,M] M^{n\u22122}).\\n([H,M] M^{n\u22122})_{1n} = (\u22121)^{n\u22122}.\\nProof. Using [H,M] = E+F, and the same grading argument: (E M^{n\u22122})_{1n} vanishes (grade too high), while (F M^{n\u22122})_{1n} equals (M^{n\u22122})_{2n}, obtained uniquely by choosing (\u2212F) at each of the n\u22122 factors of M^{n\u22122}, hence (\u22121)^{n\u22122}.\\n\\nCorollary 6.1 (an explicit identity if M is nilpotent).\\nIf M^n = 0, then for v := M^{n\u22122}e_n we have\\n(\u22121)^{n\u22122} = e_1^T[H,M]v = e_1^T(HM^{n\u22121} \u2212 MHM^{n\u22122})e_n = (\u22121)^{n\u22121} \u2212 [z_1 v_1 \u2212 2 v_2],\\nso z_1 v_1 \u2212 2 v_2 = \u22122 (\u22121)^{n\u22122}, where v_1 = (M^{n\u22122})_{1n} and v_2 = (M^{n\u22122})_{2n}.\\nProof. Insert Lemma 5 into HM^{n\u22121}, and compute M H v using the first row of M and H diagonal.\\n\\nSpecial cases (fully resolved)\\n\\n- n=2. The characteristic polynomial is \u03bb^2 \u2212 (z_1+z_2)\u03bb + (z_1 z_2 + 1). Nilpotency forces z_1+z_2 = 0 and z_1 z_2 = \u22121. The extra condition z_1 + 2z_2 = 0 then gives z_1 = \u22122z_2 and z_1 z_2 = \u22121 \u21d2 (\u22122) z_2^2 = \u22121 \u21d2 z_2^2 = 1/2, so z_1+z_2 = \u22122z_2 + z_2 = \u2212z_2 \u2260 0, contradiction. Hence no nilpotent in this family for n=2.\\n- n=3. Using the recurrence p_k(\u03bb) = (\u03bb\u2212z_k)p_{k\u22121}(\u03bb)+p_{k\u22122}(\u03bb), nilpotency requires z_1+z_2+z_3=0 and z_1 z_2 + z_1 z_3 + z_2 z_3 + 2 = 0. The third coefficient is c_{3,3} = \u2212(z_3(z_1 z_2 + 1) + z_1). Imposing the weighted condition z_1 + 2z_2 + 3z_3 = 0 together with z_1+z_2+z_3=0 gives z_2 = \u22122 z_1 and z_3 = z_1. Then the second condition yields z_1^2 = 2/3. Substituting into c_{3,3} gives c_{3,3} = 2 z_1^3 \u2212 2 z_1 \u2260 0. Hence the characteristic polynomial cannot be \u03bb^3. So no nilpotent in this family for n=3.\\n\\nCombinatorial identities for coefficients\\n\\n- Coefficient of \u03bb^{n\u22121}: c_{n,1} = \u2212\u2211 z_i. Nilpotent \u21d2 \u2211 z_i = 0.\\n- Coefficient of \u03bb^{n\u22122}: c_{n,2} = \u2211_{i<j} z_i z_j + (n\u22121) = \u2212(1/2)\u2211 z_i^2 + (n\u22121). Nilpotent \u21d2 \u2211 z_i^2 = 2(n\u22121), consistent with Lemma 4.\\n- Coefficient of \u03bb^{n\u22123} (sketch). It is the negative sum of 3\u00d73 principal minors. Each such minor equals z_i z_{i+1} z_{i+2} + z_i + z_{i+2} if the indices are consecutive; or (z_j z_{j+1} + 1) z_k if it consists of a single adjacent pair plus an isolated index; or z_i z_j z_k if all three are isolated. Summing all yields\\n\u03c3_3 = \u2211_{1\u2264i<j<k\u2264n} z_i z_j z_k + \u2211_{k=1}^n w_k z_k,\\nwhere w_1 = w_2 = w_{n\u22121} = w_n = n\u22122 and w_k = n\u22121 for 3 \u2264 k \u2264 n\u22122. Thus c_{n,3} = \u2212\u03c3_3. Under \u2211 z_i = 0, the linear part simplifies to \u2212(z_1+z_2+z_{n\u22121}+z_n). For n=3 this reduces to the explicit c_{3,3} above and provides the contradiction. For general n, this decomposition isolates a small boundary-dependent linear form in z.\\n\\nObstacles\\n\\n- A direct global contradiction for all n seems to require combining the rigid corner identities (Lemma 5\u20136\u2013Cor. 6.1) with a summation/weighting that inserts the given condition tr(HM)=0. The naive trace identities tr((E+F)M^k)=0 are too weak.\\n- Coefficients c_{n,k} for k\u22653 mix higher symmetric polynomials of z and boundary linear terms. One needs to force a mismatch via the extra linear constraint \u2211 i z_i = 0; n=3 showcases this, but a general closed-form for c_{n,3} including the cubic part is combinatorially involved.\\n\\nNext steps\\n\\n- Systematically exploit M^n=0 on corner entries using the unique-path phenomenon (Lemma 5) to derive linear recurrences for the last column v := M^{n\u22121}e_n (i.e., Mv=0 with v_1 = (\u22121)^{n\u22121} and v_0=0). Combine with e_1^T[H,M]M^{n\u22122}e_n = (\u22121)^{n\u22122} (Cor. 6.1) and its right-end analogue e_n^T M^{n\u22122}[H,M] e_1 to extract boundary identities linking z_1,z_2,z_{n\u22121},z_n only. Aim: an identity of the form \u03b1_1 z_1 + \u03b1_2 z_2 + \u03b1_{n\u22121} z_{n\u22121} + \u03b1_n z_n = const \u2260 0, contradicting \u2211 i z_i = 0 after eliminating interior z\u2019s via nilpotency constraints (e.g., \u2211 z_i = 0, \u2211 z_i^2 = 2(n\u22121)).\\n- Push the 3\u00d73 principal minor sum \u03c3_3 one step further: express its cubic part in terms of \u2211 z_i, \u2211 z_i^2, \u2211 z_i^3 and boundary corrections, then use \u2211 z_i = 0 and the given \u2211 i z_i = 0 to show c_{n,3} \u2260 0 for all n \u2265 4. The n=3 computation already shows the mechanism.\\n- Verify and formalize a general path-graded formula for (M^{n\u22122})_{2n} and (M^{n\u22122})_{n\u22121,1} (degree-1 in z with explicit boundary supports), then combine with Cor. 6.1-like identities to isolate z_1+2z_2+\u22ef+n z_n.\\n\\nSummary of progress\\n\\n- Established structural commutator and similarity identities: [H,M] = E+F and M(t) = D + e^{t}E \u2212 e^{\u2212t}F. Derived vanishing traces tr([H,M]M^k)=0.\\n- Computed tr(M^2) explicitly; nilpotency forces \u2211 z_i^2 = 2(n\u22121).\\n- Proved rigid corner-entries for M^{n\u22121}: (M^{n\u22121})_{1n} = (\u22121)^{n\u22121}, (M^{n\u22121})_{n1} = 1, independent of z. From this, extracted a boundary identity z_1 v_1 \u2212 2 v_2 = \u22122(\u22121)^{n\u22122} for v = M^{n\u22122}e_n.\\n- Fully settled n=2 and n=3: no nilpotent matrices of the prescribed form satisfy \u2211 i z_i = 0.\\n- Identified the linear (in z) part of the coefficient c_{n,3} as a boundary term \u2212(z_1+z_2+z_{n\u22121}+z_n) under \u2211 z_i=0, suggesting a robust route to contradiction in general via boundary analysis.\\n\\nThese are all testable lemmas and computations. The proposed next steps aim to close the general case by turning the corner-entry and boundary linear identities into an explicit contradiction with \u2211 i z_i = 0 for arbitrary n \u2265 4.\"}",
