Ideas

- Use the grading induced by H = diag(1,2,...,n). With E the subdiagonal ones, F the superdiagonal ones, and D = diag(z_1,...,z_n), our matrix is M = D + E − F. One checks [H,E] = E, [H,F] = −F, [H,D] = 0, hence [H,M] = E + F.
- The given condition ∑_{i=1}^n i z_i = 0 is exactly tr(HM) = 0. Nilpotency would also force tr(M) = 0 and more Newton identities. Exploit trace/commutator identities and explicit combinatorics of this tridiagonal pattern.
- Corner-entry rigidity: the (1,n) and (n,1) entries of M^{n-1} are independent of z’s. This provides rigid constraints when combined with nilpotency (M^n = 0) and commutators with H. Try to squeeze a contradiction with tr(HM)=0.

Elementary lemmas (rigorous)

Lemma 1 (grading identities).
Let H = diag(1,2,...,n), E = (e_{i+1,i})_{i=1}^{n-1}, F = (e_{i,i+1})_{i=1}^{n-1}, and D = diag(z_1,...,z_n). Then [H,E] = E, [H,F] = −F, [H,D] = 0. Consequently, for M = D + E − F, we have [H,M] = E + F.
Proof. Straightforward on basis vectors: E e_i = e_{i+1}, F e_i = e_{i-1}, and H e_i = i e_i.

Lemma 2 (similarity flow).
Define M(t) = e^{tH} M e^{−tH}. Then M(t) = D + e^{t} E − e^{−t} F. In particular M(t) is similar to M, so they have the same characteristic polynomial. Also d/dt|_{t=0} M(t) = [H,M] = E + F.

Lemma 3 (vanishing traces with [H,M]).
For any k ≥ 0, tr([H,M] M^{k}) = 0. In particular tr((E+F) M^{k}) = 0.
Proof. tr([H,M] M^{k}) = tr(HM^{k+1}) − tr(M H M^{k}) = 0 by cyclicity.

Lemma 4 (trace of M^2; necessary condition for nilpotency).
For interior 2 ≤ i ≤ n−1, (M^2)_{ii} = z_i^2 − 2; for i = 1,n, (M^2)_{ii} = z_i^2 − 1. Hence tr(M^2) = ∑_{i=1}^n z_i^2 − 2(n−1). If M is nilpotent, tr(M^2) = 0, so ∑_{i=1}^n z_i^2 = 2(n−1).
Proof. Compute (M^2)_{ii} = ∑_k M_{ik} M_{ki}; only k ∈ {i−1,i,i+1} contribute, with products 1·(−1) and (−1)·1 on off-diagonals.

Lemma 5 (corner entries of M^{n−1}).
We have (M^{n−1})_{1n} = (−1)^{n−1} and (M^{n−1})_{n1} = 1, independent of z’s.
Proof. Decompose M = D + E − F into homogeneous “grades” with respect to ad_H. The (1,n) entry has grade 1−n = −(n−1). The only way to achieve this total grade in the product of n−1 copies of M is to take the grade −1 component (−F) at each factor; any D (grade 0) or E (grade +1) would raise the grade above −(n−1). Thus (M^{n−1})_{1n} = (−1)^{n−1}(F^{n−1})_{1n} = (−1)^{n−1}. Similarly, for (n,1) one must choose E at each factor.

Lemma 6 (a fixed entry of [H,M] M^{n−2}).
([H,M] M^{n−2})_{1n} = (−1)^{n−2}.
Proof. Using [H,M] = E+F, and the same grading argument: (E M^{n−2})_{1n} vanishes (grade too high), while (F M^{n−2})_{1n} equals (M^{n−2})_{2n}, obtained uniquely by choosing (−F) at each of the n−2 factors of M^{n−2}, hence (−1)^{n−2}.

Corollary 6.1 (an explicit identity if M is nilpotent).
If M^n = 0, then for v := M^{n−2}e_n we have
(−1)^{n−2} = e_1^T[H,M]v = e_1^T(HM^{n−1} − MHM^{n−2})e_n = (−1)^{n−1} − [z_1 v_1 − 2 v_2],
so z_1 v_1 − 2 v_2 = −2 (−1)^{n−2}, where v_1 = (M^{n−2})_{1n} and v_2 = (M^{n−2})_{2n}.
Proof. Insert Lemma 5 into HM^{n−1}, and compute M H v using the first row of M and H diagonal.

Special cases (fully resolved)

- n=2. The characteristic polynomial is λ^2 − (z_1+z_2)λ + (z_1 z_2 + 1). Nilpotency forces z_1+z_2 = 0 and z_1 z_2 = −1. The extra condition z_1 + 2z_2 = 0 then gives z_1 = −2z_2 and z_1 z_2 = −1 ⇒ (−2) z_2^2 = −1 ⇒ z_2^2 = 1/2, so z_1+z_2 = −2z_2 + z_2 = −z_2 ≠ 0, contradiction. Hence no nilpotent in this family for n=2.
- n=3. Using the recurrence p_k(λ) = (λ−z_k)p_{k−1}(λ)+p_{k−2}(λ), nilpotency requires z_1+z_2+z_3=0 and z_1 z_2 + z_1 z_3 + z_2 z_3 + 2 = 0. The third coefficient is c_{3,3} = −(z_3(z_1 z_2 + 1) + z_1). Imposing the weighted condition z_1 + 2z_2 + 3z_3 = 0 together with z_1+z_2+z_3=0 gives z_2 = −2 z_1 and z_3 = z_1. Then the second condition yields z_1^2 = 2/3. Substituting into c_{3,3} gives c_{3,3} = 2 z_1^3 − 2 z_1 ≠ 0. Hence the characteristic polynomial cannot be λ^3. So no nilpotent in this family for n=3.

Combinatorial identities for coefficients

- Coefficient of λ^{n−1}: c_{n,1} = −∑ z_i. Nilpotent ⇒ ∑ z_i = 0.
- Coefficient of λ^{n−2}: c_{n,2} = ∑_{i<j} z_i z_j + (n−1) = −(1/2)∑ z_i^2 + (n−1). Nilpotent ⇒ ∑ z_i^2 = 2(n−1), consistent with Lemma 4.
- Coefficient of λ^{n−3} (sketch). It is the negative sum of 3×3 principal minors. Each such minor equals z_i z_{i+1} z_{i+2} + z_i + z_{i+2} if the indices are consecutive; or (z_j z_{j+1} + 1) z_k if it consists of a single adjacent pair plus an isolated index; or z_i z_j z_k if all three are isolated. Summing all yields
σ_3 = ∑_{1≤i<j<k≤n} z_i z_j z_k + ∑_{k=1}^n w_k z_k,
where w_1 = w_2 = w_{n−1} = w_n = n−2 and w_k = n−1 for 3 ≤ k ≤ n−2. Thus c_{n,3} = −σ_3. Under ∑ z_i = 0, the linear part simplifies to −(z_1+z_2+z_{n−1}+z_n). For n=3 this reduces to the explicit c_{3,3} above and provides the contradiction. For general n, this decomposition isolates a small boundary-dependent linear form in z.

Obstacles

- A direct global contradiction for all n seems to require combining the rigid corner identities (Lemma 5–6–Cor. 6.1) with a summation/weighting that inserts the given condition tr(HM)=0. The naive trace identities tr((E+F)M^k)=0 are too weak.
- Coefficients c_{n,k} for k≥3 mix higher symmetric polynomials of z and boundary linear terms. One needs to force a mismatch via the extra linear constraint ∑ i z_i = 0; n=3 showcases this, but a general closed-form for c_{n,3} including the cubic part is combinatorially involved.

Next steps

- Systematically exploit M^n=0 on corner entries using the unique-path phenomenon (Lemma 5) to derive linear recurrences for the last column v := M^{n−1}e_n (i.e., Mv=0 with v_1 = (−1)^{n−1} and v_0=0). Combine with e_1^T[H,M]M^{n−2}e_n = (−1)^{n−2} (Cor. 6.1) and its right-end analogue e_n^T M^{n−2}[H,M] e_1 to extract boundary identities linking z_1,z_2,z_{n−1},z_n only. Aim: an identity of the form α_1 z_1 + α_2 z_2 + α_{n−1} z_{n−1} + α_n z_n = const ≠ 0, contradicting ∑ i z_i = 0 after eliminating interior z’s via nilpotency constraints (e.g., ∑ z_i = 0, ∑ z_i^2 = 2(n−1)).
- Push the 3×3 principal minor sum σ_3 one step further: express its cubic part in terms of ∑ z_i, ∑ z_i^2, ∑ z_i^3 and boundary corrections, then use ∑ z_i = 0 and the given ∑ i z_i = 0 to show c_{n,3} ≠ 0 for all n ≥ 4. The n=3 computation already shows the mechanism.
- Verify and formalize a general path-graded formula for (M^{n−2})_{2n} and (M^{n−2})_{n−1,1} (degree-1 in z with explicit boundary supports), then combine with Cor. 6.1-like identities to isolate z_1+2z_2+⋯+n z_n.

Summary of progress

- Established structural commutator and similarity identities: [H,M] = E+F and M(t) = D + e^{t}E − e^{−t}F. Derived vanishing traces tr([H,M]M^k)=0.
- Computed tr(M^2) explicitly; nilpotency forces ∑ z_i^2 = 2(n−1).
- Proved rigid corner-entries for M^{n−1}: (M^{n−1})_{1n} = (−1)^{n−1}, (M^{n−1})_{n1} = 1, independent of z. From this, extracted a boundary identity z_1 v_1 − 2 v_2 = −2(−1)^{n−2} for v = M^{n−2}e_n.
- Fully settled n=2 and n=3: no nilpotent matrices of the prescribed form satisfy ∑ i z_i = 0.
- Identified the linear (in z) part of the coefficient c_{n,3} as a boundary term −(z_1+z_2+z_{n−1}+z_n) under ∑ z_i=0, suggesting a robust route to contradiction in general via boundary analysis.

These are all testable lemmas and computations. The proposed next steps aim to close the general case by turning the corner-entry and boundary linear identities into an explicit contradiction with ∑ i z_i = 0 for arbitrary n ≥ 4.
