These give necessary algebraic constraints for nilpotence, including new ones that isolate the contributions of the two endpoints z_1 and z_n. The plan is to combine these with the weighted linear constraint \u2211 i z_i = 0 and pursue an induction-on-n \u201cedge-peeling\u201d strategy.\n\n# Setup and basic continuant facts\n\nLet M be the n\u00d7n tridiagonal with diagonal z_1,\u2026,z_n, sub-diagonal entries 1, and super-diagonal entries \u22121. Set\n\n- \u0394_0(\u03bb) = 1,\n- \u0394_1(\u03bb) = \u03bb \u2212 z_1,\n- \u0394_{k+1}(\u03bb) = (\u03bb \u2212 z_{k+1}) \u0394_k(\u03bb) + \u0394_{k\u22121}(\u03bb) for k \u2265 1.\n\nThen \u0394_n(\u03bb) = det(\u03bb I \u2212 M). In particular, det M = (\u22121)^n \u0394_n(0).\n\nWrite \u03b1_k := det M_{[1..k]} (the leading k\u00d7k principal minor of M). Then \u03b1_0 = 1, \u03b1_1 = z_1, and \u03b1_{k+1} = z_{k+1} \u03b1_k + \u03b1_{k\u22121}. Also \u0394_k(0) = (\u22121)^k \u03b1_k.\n\nNilpotence (det(\u03bb I \u2212 M) = \u03bb^n) forces all coefficients except the leading to vanish. We translate the first coefficients and certain traces in terms of the z_i.\n\n# Necessary conditions for nilpotence\n\n- Coefficient of \u03bb^{n\u22121}: \u2212 tr M = \u2212\u2211_{i=1}^n z_i = 0. So \u2211 z_i = 0.\n\n- Coefficient of \u03bb^{n\u22122}: sum of all principal 2\u00d72 minors. For non-adjacent pairs {i,j}, the 2\u00d72 principal minor is z_i z_j; for adjacent pairs {i,i+1} it is z_i z_{i+1} \u2212 (\u22121)\u00b71 = z_i z_{i+1} + 1. Hence\n  \u2211_{1\u2264i<j\u2264n} z_i z_j + (n\u22121) = 0.\n  Equivalently, using (\u2211 z_i)^2 = \u2211 z_i^2 + 2\u2211_{i<j} z_i z_j and \u2211 z_i = 0,\n  tr(M^2) = 0 \u21d2 \u2211_{i=1}^n z_i^2 = 2(n\u22121).\n\n  A direct check via M^2 also gives tr(M^2) = \u2211 z_i^2 \u2212 (2n\u22122): the diagonal of K^2 (K = off-diagonal part) is \u22121 at i = 1, n and \u22122 otherwise.\n\n- Coefficient of \u03bb^{n\u22123}: combinatorial identity. Using the continuant/matching expansion\n  \u0394_n(\u03bb) = \u2211_{matchings M on P_n} \u220f_{i\u2209V(M)} (\u03bb \u2212 z_i),\n  the coefficient of \u03bb^{n\u22123} collects contributions from:\n  \u2022 matchings with 0 edges: choose 3 z\u2019s \u2192 \u2212\u2211_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k,\n  \u2022 matchings with 1 edge: choose 1 z among unmatched vertices \u2192 \u2212\u2211_{|M|=1} \u2211_{i\u2209V(M)} z_i.\n\n  Summing over all single edges e_k = {k,k+1}, the inner sum counts each interior vertex i\u2208{2,\u2026,n\u22121} exactly (n\u22123) times (all edges except k = i\u22121,i), and each end i\u2208{1,n} exactly (n\u22122) times. Thus\n  \u2211_{|M|=1} \u2211_{i\u2209V(M)} z_i = (n\u22123) \u2211_{i=1}^n z_i + (z_1 + z_n).\n\n  Therefore the \u03bb^{n\u22123} coefficient is\n  c_{n\u22123} = \u2212\u2211_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k \u2212 (n\u22123) \u2211_{i=1}^n z_i \u2212 (z_1 + z_n).\n  Under nilpotence c_{n\u22123} = 0, and using \u2211 z_i = 0 we get the clean identity\n  \u2211_{1\u2264i<j<k\u2264n} z_i z_j z_k = \u2212(z_1 + z_n).\n\n  By Newton\u2019s identities with e_1 = 0 and e_2 = \u2212(n\u22121), this implies\n  \u2211 z_i^3 = 3 e_3 = \u22123(z_1 + z_n),\n  which also matches tr(M^3) = 0 computed directly (see below).\n\n# Trace(M^3) check\n\nWrite M = D + K with D diagonal, K skew-symmetric tridiagonal (1 below, \u22121 above). A direct expansion shows, using trace-cyclicity and the vanishing of traces with an odd number of K\u2019s except in the mixed terms:\n\ntr(M^3) = tr(D^3) + 2 tr(D K^2) + tr(K D K).\n\nOne computes tr(D K^2) = \u22122\u2211 z_i + (z_1 + z_n) and tr(K D K) = \u22122\u2211 z_i + (z_1 + z_n). Thus, with \u2211 z_i = 0,\n\ntr(M^3) = \u2211 z_i^3 + 3(z_1 + z_n).\n\nNilpotence forces tr(M^3)=0, i.e. \u2211 z_i^3 = \u22123(z_1 + z_n), as above.\n\n# A Wronskian-type telescoping identity for continuants\n\nLet T_k(\u03bb) = \u0394_k'(\u03bb) \u0394_{k\u22121}(\u03bb) \u2212 \u0394_k(\u03bb) \u0394_{k\u22121}'(\u03bb). Differentiating the recurrence yields the telescoping relation T_{k+1} + T_k = \u0394_k(\u03bb)^2, with base T_1(\u03bb) = 1. Hence\n\nT_n(\u03bb) = (\u22121)^{n\u22121} [1 \u2212 \u0394_1(\u03bb)^2 + \u0394_2(\u03bb)^2 \u2212 \u22ef + (\u22121)^{n\u22121} \u0394_{n\u22121}(\u03bb)^2].\n\nEvaluating at \u03bb = 0 and using \u0394_n(\u03bb) = \u03bb^n under nilpotence (so \u0394_n(0) = 0 and \u0394_n'(0) = 0 for n\u22652), we get T_n(0) = 0 and the necessary identity\n\n1 \u2212 a_1^2 + a_2^2 \u2212 \u22ef + (\u22121)^{n\u22121} a_{n\u22121}^2 = 0,  where a_k = \u0394_k(0) = (\u22121)^k \u03b1_k.\n\nEquivalently, in terms of leading principal minors \u03b1_k = det M_{[1..k]},\n\n1 \u2212 \u03b1_1^2 + \u03b1_2^2 \u2212 \u22ef + (\u22121)^{n\u22121} \u03b1_{n\u22121}^2 = 0.\n\nThis adds a global quadratic constraint on the sequence of principal minors that any nilpotent instance must satisfy.\n\n# Cofactor factorization at \u03bb=0\n\nFor A(\u03bb) = \u03bb I \u2212 M, the i-th principal cofactor at \u03bb satisfies\n\nC_{ii}(\u03bb) = \u0394_{i\u22121}(\u03bb) \u00b7 \u0394^{(i+1)}_{n\u2212i}(\u03bb),\n\nwhere the second factor is the continuant built from z_{i+1},\u2026,z_n. At \u03bb = 0, if \u0394_n(\u03bb) were identically \u03bb^n, then all i-cofactors of A(\u03bb) would vanish at \u03bb = 0 (equivalently, det(\u2212M) is stationary in each z_i at that point). Thus any nilpotent solution must satisfy the system\n\n\u0394_{i\u22121}(0) \u00b7 \u0394^{(i+1)}_{n\u2212i}(0) = 0,  for all i = 1,\u2026,n.\n\nThis forces a combinatorial propagation of zeros among the leading and trailing continuants, severely restricting possible z. In combination with the Wronskian identity above, this suggests a strong rigidity that we aim to exploit.\n\n# How the weighted constraint enters\n\nThe given condition is \u2211_{i=1}^n i z_i = 0. We record two calculi that connect it to the structure:\n\n- tr(W M) = \u2211 i z_i, where W = diag(1,2,\u2026,n). So the weight constraint is tr(W M) = 0.\n\n- The fixed commutator [W, M] = S is the symmetric tridiagonal with 1 on both off-diagonals and 0 on the diagonal, independent of z. Although tr([M^k, W]) = 0 yields tr(S M^{k\u22121}) = 0 for all k, this holds for all z and thus does not isolate the weighted constraint by itself. Nonetheless, it provides a stable algebraic framework to combine with specific coefficient identities.\n\n# Examples and checks\n\n- For n \u2264 5, c_{n\u22123} identity simplifies drastically and is easy to verify symbolically; when combined with e_1 = 0 and e_2 = \u2212(n\u22121), it agrees with computational checks that no solution exists under \u2211 i z_i = 0.\n\n- The Wronskian identity furnishes a nontrivial necessary condition that can be explicitly tested for small n using the recurrences for \u03b1_k.\n\n# Obstacles\n\n- Extending the explicit coefficient computation to \u03bb^{n\u22124} and beyond requires careful combinatorial accounting of matchings. While feasible, the bookkeeping is intricate (boundary effects and adjacency exclusions), so we present only the precise \u03bb^{n\u22123} identity here.\n\n- Direct use of commutator identities alone does not leverage the weighted constraint. One needs to combine them with coefficient identities or principal-minor propagation to get contradictions.\n\n# Next steps\n\n- Compute c_{n\u22124} explicitly. Strategy: express the \u03bb^{n\u22124} coefficient as\n  c_{n\u22124} = e_4 \u2212 Q + m_2,\n  where m_2 is the number of 2-edge matchings on P_n, and Q = \u2211_{edges} \u2211_{pairs of unmatched vertices} z_i z_j. One can show\n  Q = (n\u22124) e_2 + \u2211_{i=1}^{n\u22121} z_i z_{i+1},\n  by counting for each pair {i,j} how many edges avoid both i and j (endpoints contribute one extra allowed edge). This yields a closed form for c_{n\u22124}. Then impose c_{n\u22124}=0 together with e_1=0, e_2=\u2212(n\u22121), and the \u03bb^{n\u22123} identity to isolate z_1 + z_n and the nearest-neighbor sum \u2211 z_i z_{i+1}. Combined with \u2211 i z_i = 0, this should force a contradiction (e.g., by induction peeling the ends).\n\n- Pursue an induction: assume no nilpotent instance for size < n; from the identities deduce z_1 = z_n = 0, reduce to size n\u22122 via the Schur complement of the middle block, and conclude.\n\n- Alternatively, use the cofactor-vanishing propagation \u0394_{i\u22121}(0) \u0394^{(i+1)}_{n\u2212i}(0) = 0 for all i. Combine with the Wronskian identity to prove that all \u03b1_k must vanish, which is impossible when inserted into 1 \u2212 \u03b1_1^2 + \u03b1_2^2 \u2212 \u22ef + (\u22121)^{n\u22121} \u03b1_{n\u22121}^2 = 0.\n\n# Summary of proven, reusable lemmas\n\n- Continuant recurrence: \u0394_{k+1} = (\u03bb \u2212 z_{k+1}) \u0394_k + \u0394_{k\u22121}.\n\n- Nilpotence implies: \u2211 z_i = 0, \u2211_{i<j} z_i z_j = \u2212(n\u22121), and \u2211_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k = \u2212(z_1 + z_n).\n\n- Trace identities: tr(M^2) = \u2211 z_i^2 \u2212 (2n\u22122), tr(M^3) = \u2211 z_i^3 + 3(z_1 + z_n). Under nilpotence these vanish, consistent with the above symmetric sums.\n\n- Wronskian identity at \u03bb = 0: 1 \u2212 \u03b1_1^2 + \u03b1_2^2 \u2212 \u22ef + (\u22121)^{n\u22121} \u03b1_{n\u22121}^2 = 0.\n\nThese are nontrivial, checkable constraints. The intended completion is to add c_{n\u22124} (and possibly c_{n\u22125}) in closed form, then combine with the weighted linear constraint to force a contradiction for all n.\n"
