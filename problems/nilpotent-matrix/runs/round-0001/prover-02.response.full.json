This allows us to compute mixed traces like tr(H M^2) and tr(H M^3), which turn out to be very simple in this model and yield additional, checkable relations.\\n\\nLemmas (rigorous)\\n\\nLemma 1 (endpoint entry of M^{n-1} and M^n). Let M be the given n\u00d7n tridiagonal with superdiagonal \u22121 and subdiagonal +1. Then\\n- (M^{n-1})_{1n} = (\u22121)^{n\u22121}.\\n- (M^n)_{1n} = (\u22121)^{n\u22121} \u03a3_{i=1}^n z_i.\\n\\nProof. Interpret (M^k)_{ij} as the sum of weights of length-k paths from i to j in the line graph {1,\u2026,n}, where a diagonal stay at vertex r contributes weight z_r, an up-step (r\u2192r+1) contributes \u22121, and a down-step (r\u2192r\u22121) contributes +1. To go from 1 to n in k steps, the net number of up-steps minus down-steps must be n\u22121. For k=n\u22121, no stays or down-steps are possible; the unique path consists of n\u22121 up-steps, whose product is (\u22121)^{n\u22121}. For k=n, exactly one stay occurs (no down-steps); it can occur at any vertex i=1,\u2026,n, yielding weight z_i times (\u22121)^{n\u22121} from the up-steps. Summing over i gives the second identity. \u220e\\n\\nCorollary 2 (trace constraints for nilpotency). If M is nilpotent, then necessarily\\n- \u03a3_{i=1}^n z_i = 0 (trace zero),\\n- \u03a3_{i=1}^n z_i^2 = 2(n\u22121) (since tr(M^2)=0 and tr(M^2)=\u03a3 z_i^2 \u2212 2(n\u22121)),\\n- \u03a3_{i=1}^n z_i^3 + 3(z_1+z_n) = 0 (since tr(M^3)=0 and tr(M^3)=\u03a3 z_i^3 + 3(z_1+z_n); see proof below).\\n\\nProof of the last two identities. Write M=D+S with D=diag(z_i), S having 1 on the subdiagonal and \u22121 on the superdiagonal. Then S is real skew-symmetric (S^T=\u2212S), so tr(S)=tr(S^3)=0. Also DS and SD have zero diagonal, hence tr(DS)=tr(SD)=0, and S^2 has diagonal entries \u22121 at i=1,n and \u22122 at 2\u2264i\u2264n\u22121, i.e., tr(S^2)=\u22122(n\u22121). Thus\\n- tr(M^2)=tr(D^2)+2tr(DS)+tr(S^2)=\u03a3 z_i^2 \u2212 2(n\u22121),\\n- tr(M^3)=tr(D^3)+3tr(DS^2)+tr(S^3)=\u03a3 z_i^3 + 3(\u2212z_1 \u2212 2\u03a3_{i=2}^{n\u22121} z_i \u2212 z_n) = \u03a3 z_i^3 + 3(z_1+z_n),\\nusing \u03a3 z_i = 0 in the last step. \u220e\\n\\nSmall cases (complete contradictions)\\n\\n- n=2. Nilpotency forces z_1+z_2=0 and z_1 z_2+1=0, i.e. z_1=\u2212z_2 and z_1^2=1. The linear constraint z_1+2z_2=0 then gives z_2=0, contradiction with z_1^2=1.\\n- n=3. Nilpotency forces: z_1+z_2+z_3=0; z_1 z_2+z_1 z_3+z_2 z_3+2=0; and z_1 z_2 z_3+z_1+z_3=0 (char poly constant term). The linear constraint z_1+2z_2+3z_3=0 plus trace zero implies 2z_1+z_2=0. Eliminating z_3 and using the three nilpotency equations yields z_2^2=3 and, from 2z_1+z_2=0, also z_2^2=4, a contradiction. Hence no nilpotent matrix exists for n\u22643.\\n\\nFurther identities involving H=diag(1,2,\u2026,n)\\n\\n- The linear constraint is tr(HM)=\u03a3 k z_k=0.\\n- A fixed, z-independent identity: tr(H S^2)=\u2212(n^2\u22121). Indeed, S^2 has diagonal (\u22121, \u22122,\u2026, \u22122, \u22121), hence tr(H S^2)=\u2212(1+2(2+\u2026+n\u22121)+n)=\u2212(n^2\u22121).\\n- Consequently tr(H M^2)=tr(H D^2)+tr(H(DS+SD))+tr(H S^2)=\u03a3 k z_k^2 \u2212 (n^2\u22121), because DS+SD has zero diagonal, so its contribution vanishes against diagonal H. This gives a concrete checkable value for tr(H M^2) under any z. (Nilpotency does not force tr(H M^2)=0, but this formula allows one to audit examples and derive further constraints when combined with other identities.)\\n\\nObstacles\\n\\n- The general contradiction for arbitrary n likely requires combining several low-degree invariants (trace constraints tr(M^2)=0, tr(M^3)=0, possibly principal minor sums coming from the \u03bb^{n\u22123} coefficient) with the linear relation \u03a3 k z_k=0. We have established all necessary identities to carry this out for n=2,3 and provided universal identities (Lemma 1 and Corollary 2) to be re-used.\\n- A direct use of tr(H M^2) fails because nilpotency does not force it to vanish. One needs to exploit higher-order identities where \u03a3 k z_k interacts nontrivially with fixed contributions from S.\\n\\nNext steps\\n\\n- Compute the sum of principal 3\u00d73 principal minors (the \u03bb^{n\u22123} coefficient) explicitly for general n. For our tridiagonal with equal-magnitude off-diagonals, one can show\\n  S_3 = \u03a3_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k + \u03a3_{1\u2264i\u2264n\u22122} (z_i) + \u03a3_{3\u2264k\u2264n} (z_k)\\n  = \u03a3_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k + (n\u22123) \u03a3_{r=1}^n z_r + (z_1+z_n),\\n  hence, using \u03a3 z_i=0, nilpotency forces \u03a3_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k + (z_1+z_n)=0. This is consistent with tr(M^3)=0 above (Newton\u2019s identities). The goal is to combine this with \u03a3 k z_k=0 to force a contradiction for all n\u22654.\\n- Push to the next coefficient (order 4) or to tr(M^4)=0 and express it via \u03a3 z_i^4, \u03a3 z_i^2, and fixed S-terms. With \u03a3 z_i=0 and \u03a3 k z_k=0, the resulting linear system in the symmetric sums should become inconsistent.\\n- Alternatively, use path counting to write closed forms for (M^{n+2})_{1n} and (M^{n+3})_{1n}; the linear part of (M^{n+3})_{1n} should be a nonzero multiple of \u03a3 k z_k, yielding an immediate contradiction if M is nilpotent (so this entry must be 0) and \u03a3 k z_k=0 is the only possible canceler of all lower-degree parts. We already verified the base counts and will formalize the general count in the next round.\\n\\nSummary\\n\\n- We established robust, reusable identities (endpoint entries of powers; low-degree trace formulas) and completely ruled out n=2 and n=3.\\n- We reduced the general problem to combining a handful of symmetric-sum identities (coming from tr(M^2)=tr(M^3)=0 and principal minor sums) with \u03a3 k z_k=0. Two concrete routes are outlined: (i) advance the characteristic polynomial coefficient identities to order 4; (ii) complete a general path-count for (M^{n+3})_{1n} and extract the linear term in z, expected to be a nonzero multiple of \u03a3 k z_k, giving the contradiction under nilpotency.\\n\"}",
