# Ideas

We encode the characteristic polynomial via continuants and extract explicit coefficient identities. These give necessary algebraic constraints for nilpotence, including new ones that isolate the contributions of the two endpoints z_1 and z_n. The plan is to combine these with the weighted linear constraint ∑ i z_i = 0 and pursue an induction-on-n “edge-peeling” strategy.

# Setup and basic continuant facts

Let M be the n×n tridiagonal with diagonal z_1,…,z_n, sub-diagonal entries 1, and super-diagonal entries −1. Set

- Δ_0(λ) = 1,
- Δ_1(λ) = λ − z_1,
- Δ_{k+1}(λ) = (λ − z_{k+1}) Δ_k(λ) + Δ_{k−1}(λ) for k ≥ 1.

Then Δ_n(λ) = det(λ I − M). In particular, det M = (−1)^n Δ_n(0).

Write α_k := det M_{[1..k]} (the leading k×k principal minor of M). Then α_0 = 1, α_1 = z_1, and α_{k+1} = z_{k+1} α_k + α_{k−1}. Also Δ_k(0) = (−1)^k α_k.

Nilpotence (det(λ I − M) = λ^n) forces all coefficients except the leading to vanish. We translate the first coefficients and certain traces in terms of the z_i.

# Necessary conditions for nilpotence

- Coefficient of λ^{n−1}: − tr M = −∑_{i=1}^n z_i = 0. So ∑ z_i = 0.

- Coefficient of λ^{n−2}: sum of all principal 2×2 minors. For non-adjacent pairs {i,j}, the 2×2 principal minor is z_i z_j; for adjacent pairs {i,i+1} it is z_i z_{i+1} − (−1)·1 = z_i z_{i+1} + 1. Hence
  ∑_{1≤i<j≤n} z_i z_j + (n−1) = 0.
  Equivalently, using (∑ z_i)^2 = ∑ z_i^2 + 2∑_{i<j} z_i z_j and ∑ z_i = 0,
  tr(M^2) = 0 ⇒ ∑_{i=1}^n z_i^2 = 2(n−1).

  A direct check via M^2 also gives tr(M^2) = ∑ z_i^2 − (2n−2): the diagonal of K^2 (K = off-diagonal part) is −1 at i = 1, n and −2 otherwise.

- Coefficient of λ^{n−3}: combinatorial identity. Using the continuant/matching expansion
  Δ_n(λ) = ∑_{matchings M on P_n} ∏_{i∉V(M)} (λ − z_i),
  the coefficient of λ^{n−3} collects contributions from:
  • matchings with 0 edges: choose 3 z’s → −∑_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k,
  • matchings with 1 edge: choose 1 z among unmatched vertices → −∑_{|M|=1} ∑_{i∉V(M)} z_i.

  Summing over all single edges e_k = {k,k+1}, the inner sum counts each interior vertex i∈{2,…,n−1} exactly (n−3) times (all edges except k = i−1,i), and each end i∈{1,n} exactly (n−2) times. Thus
  ∑_{|M|=1} ∑_{i∉V(M)} z_i = (n−3) ∑_{i=1}^n z_i + (z_1 + z_n).

  Therefore the λ^{n−3} coefficient is
  c_{n−3} = −∑_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k − (n−3) ∑_{i=1}^n z_i − (z_1 + z_n).
  Under nilpotence c_{n−3} = 0, and using ∑ z_i = 0 we get the clean identity
  ∑_{1≤i<j<k≤n} z_i z_j z_k = −(z_1 + z_n).

  By Newton’s identities with e_1 = 0 and e_2 = −(n−1), this implies
  ∑ z_i^3 = 3 e_3 = −3(z_1 + z_n),
  which also matches tr(M^3) = 0 computed directly (see below).

# Trace(M^3) check

Write M = D + K with D diagonal, K skew-symmetric tridiagonal (1 below, −1 above). A direct expansion shows, using trace-cyclicity and the vanishing of traces with an odd number of K’s except in the mixed terms:

tr(M^3) = tr(D^3) + 2 tr(D K^2) + tr(K D K).

One computes tr(D K^2) = −2∑ z_i + (z_1 + z_n) and tr(K D K) = −2∑ z_i + (z_1 + z_n). Thus, with ∑ z_i = 0,

tr(M^3) = ∑ z_i^3 + 3(z_1 + z_n).

Nilpotence forces tr(M^3)=0, i.e. ∑ z_i^3 = −3(z_1 + z_n), as above.

# A Wronskian-type telescoping identity for continuants

Let T_k(λ) = Δ_k'(λ) Δ_{k−1}(λ) − Δ_k(λ) Δ_{k−1}'(λ). Differentiating the recurrence yields the telescoping relation T_{k+1} + T_k = Δ_k(λ)^2, with base T_1(λ) = 1. Hence

T_n(λ) = (−1)^{n−1} [1 − Δ_1(λ)^2 + Δ_2(λ)^2 − ⋯ + (−1)^{n−1} Δ_{n−1}(λ)^2].

Evaluating at λ = 0 and using Δ_n(λ) = λ^n under nilpotence (so Δ_n(0) = 0 and Δ_n'(0) = 0 for n≥2), we get T_n(0) = 0 and the necessary identity

1 − a_1^2 + a_2^2 − ⋯ + (−1)^{n−1} a_{n−1}^2 = 0,  where a_k = Δ_k(0) = (−1)^k α_k.

Equivalently, in terms of leading principal minors α_k = det M_{[1..k]},

1 − α_1^2 + α_2^2 − ⋯ + (−1)^{n−1} α_{n−1}^2 = 0.

This adds a global quadratic constraint on the sequence of principal minors that any nilpotent instance must satisfy.

# Cofactor factorization at λ=0

For A(λ) = λ I − M, the i-th principal cofactor at λ satisfies

C_{ii}(λ) = Δ_{i−1}(λ) · Δ^{(i+1)}_{n−i}(λ),

where the second factor is the continuant built from z_{i+1},…,z_n. At λ = 0, if Δ_n(λ) were identically λ^n, then all i-cofactors of A(λ) would vanish at λ = 0 (equivalently, det(−M) is stationary in each z_i at that point). Thus any nilpotent solution must satisfy the system

Δ_{i−1}(0) · Δ^{(i+1)}_{n−i}(0) = 0,  for all i = 1,…,n.

This forces a combinatorial propagation of zeros among the leading and trailing continuants, severely restricting possible z. In combination with the Wronskian identity above, this suggests a strong rigidity that we aim to exploit.

# How the weighted constraint enters

The given condition is ∑_{i=1}^n i z_i = 0. We record two calculi that connect it to the structure:

- tr(W M) = ∑ i z_i, where W = diag(1,2,…,n). So the weight constraint is tr(W M) = 0.

- The fixed commutator [W, M] = S is the symmetric tridiagonal with 1 on both off-diagonals and 0 on the diagonal, independent of z. Although tr([M^k, W]) = 0 yields tr(S M^{k−1}) = 0 for all k, this holds for all z and thus does not isolate the weighted constraint by itself. Nonetheless, it provides a stable algebraic framework to combine with specific coefficient identities.

# Examples and checks

- For n ≤ 5, c_{n−3} identity simplifies drastically and is easy to verify symbolically; when combined with e_1 = 0 and e_2 = −(n−1), it agrees with computational checks that no solution exists under ∑ i z_i = 0.

- The Wronskian identity furnishes a nontrivial necessary condition that can be explicitly tested for small n using the recurrences for α_k.

# Obstacles

- Extending the explicit coefficient computation to λ^{n−4} and beyond requires careful combinatorial accounting of matchings. While feasible, the bookkeeping is intricate (boundary effects and adjacency exclusions), so we present only the precise λ^{n−3} identity here.

- Direct use of commutator identities alone does not leverage the weighted constraint. One needs to combine them with coefficient identities or principal-minor propagation to get contradictions.

# Next steps

- Compute c_{n−4} explicitly. Strategy: express the λ^{n−4} coefficient as
  c_{n−4} = e_4 − Q + m_2,
  where m_2 is the number of 2-edge matchings on P_n, and Q = ∑_{edges} ∑_{pairs of unmatched vertices} z_i z_j. One can show
  Q = (n−4) e_2 + ∑_{i=1}^{n−1} z_i z_{i+1},
  by counting for each pair {i,j} how many edges avoid both i and j (endpoints contribute one extra allowed edge). This yields a closed form for c_{n−4}. Then impose c_{n−4}=0 together with e_1=0, e_2=−(n−1), and the λ^{n−3} identity to isolate z_1 + z_n and the nearest-neighbor sum ∑ z_i z_{i+1}. Combined with ∑ i z_i = 0, this should force a contradiction (e.g., by induction peeling the ends).

- Pursue an induction: assume no nilpotent instance for size < n; from the identities deduce z_1 = z_n = 0, reduce to size n−2 via the Schur complement of the middle block, and conclude.

- Alternatively, use the cofactor-vanishing propagation Δ_{i−1}(0) Δ^{(i+1)}_{n−i}(0) = 0 for all i. Combine with the Wronskian identity to prove that all α_k must vanish, which is impossible when inserted into 1 − α_1^2 + α_2^2 − ⋯ + (−1)^{n−1} α_{n−1}^2 = 0.

# Summary of proven, reusable lemmas

- Continuant recurrence: Δ_{k+1} = (λ − z_{k+1}) Δ_k + Δ_{k−1}.

- Nilpotence implies: ∑ z_i = 0, ∑_{i<j} z_i z_j = −(n−1), and ∑_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k = −(z_1 + z_n).

- Trace identities: tr(M^2) = ∑ z_i^2 − (2n−2), tr(M^3) = ∑ z_i^3 + 3(z_1 + z_n). Under nilpotence these vanish, consistent with the above symmetric sums.

- Wronskian identity at λ = 0: 1 − α_1^2 + α_2^2 − ⋯ + (−1)^{n−1} α_{n−1}^2 = 0.

These are nontrivial, checkable constraints. The intended completion is to add c_{n−4} (and possibly c_{n−5}) in closed form, then combine with the weighted linear constraint to force a contradiction for all n.
