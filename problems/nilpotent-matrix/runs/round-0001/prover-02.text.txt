Ideas

- Use two complementary tools tailored to this tridiagonal pattern:
  1) path-counting for specific entries of powers of M (in particular the (1,n)-entry), which produces identities whose right-hand side is a fixed symmetric polynomial in z_1,…,z_n plus small constants; and
  2) trace identities for low powers of M, which, for nilpotent M, force explicit algebraic constraints on z_1,…,z_n.
- The linear constraint Σ_{k=1}^n k z_k = 0 can be recognized as tr(H M)=0, with H=diag(1,2,…,n). This allows us to compute mixed traces like tr(H M^2) and tr(H M^3), which turn out to be very simple in this model and yield additional, checkable relations.

Lemmas (rigorous)

Lemma 1 (endpoint entry of M^{n-1} and M^n). Let M be the given n×n tridiagonal with superdiagonal −1 and subdiagonal +1. Then
- (M^{n-1})_{1n} = (−1)^{n−1}.
- (M^n)_{1n} = (−1)^{n−1} Σ_{i=1}^n z_i.

Proof. Interpret (M^k)_{ij} as the sum of weights of length-k paths from i to j in the line graph {1,…,n}, where a diagonal stay at vertex r contributes weight z_r, an up-step (r→r+1) contributes −1, and a down-step (r→r−1) contributes +1. To go from 1 to n in k steps, the net number of up-steps minus down-steps must be n−1. For k=n−1, no stays or down-steps are possible; the unique path consists of n−1 up-steps, whose product is (−1)^{n−1}. For k=n, exactly one stay occurs (no down-steps); it can occur at any vertex i=1,…,n, yielding weight z_i times (−1)^{n−1} from the up-steps. Summing over i gives the second identity. ∎

Corollary 2 (trace constraints for nilpotency). If M is nilpotent, then necessarily
- Σ_{i=1}^n z_i = 0 (trace zero),
- Σ_{i=1}^n z_i^2 = 2(n−1) (since tr(M^2)=0 and tr(M^2)=Σ z_i^2 − 2(n−1)),
- Σ_{i=1}^n z_i^3 + 3(z_1+z_n) = 0 (since tr(M^3)=0 and tr(M^3)=Σ z_i^3 + 3(z_1+z_n); see proof below).

Proof of the last two identities. Write M=D+S with D=diag(z_i), S having 1 on the subdiagonal and −1 on the superdiagonal. Then S is real skew-symmetric (S^T=−S), so tr(S)=tr(S^3)=0. Also DS and SD have zero diagonal, hence tr(DS)=tr(SD)=0, and S^2 has diagonal entries −1 at i=1,n and −2 at 2≤i≤n−1, i.e., tr(S^2)=−2(n−1). Thus
- tr(M^2)=tr(D^2)+2tr(DS)+tr(S^2)=Σ z_i^2 − 2(n−1),
- tr(M^3)=tr(D^3)+3tr(DS^2)+tr(S^3)=Σ z_i^3 + 3(−z_1 − 2Σ_{i=2}^{n−1} z_i − z_n) = Σ z_i^3 + 3(z_1+z_n),
using Σ z_i = 0 in the last step. ∎

Small cases (complete contradictions)

- n=2. Nilpotency forces z_1+z_2=0 and z_1 z_2+1=0, i.e. z_1=−z_2 and z_1^2=1. The linear constraint z_1+2z_2=0 then gives z_2=0, contradiction with z_1^2=1.
- n=3. Nilpotency forces: z_1+z_2+z_3=0; z_1 z_2+z_1 z_3+z_2 z_3+2=0; and z_1 z_2 z_3+z_1+z_3=0 (char poly constant term). The linear constraint z_1+2z_2+3z_3=0 plus trace zero implies 2z_1+z_2=0. Eliminating z_3 and using the three nilpotency equations yields z_2^2=3 and, from 2z_1+z_2=0, also z_2^2=4, a contradiction. Hence no nilpotent matrix exists for n≤3.

Further identities involving H=diag(1,2,…,n)

- The linear constraint is tr(HM)=Σ k z_k=0.
- A fixed, z-independent identity: tr(H S^2)=−(n^2−1). Indeed, S^2 has diagonal (−1, −2,…, −2, −1), hence tr(H S^2)=−(1+2(2+…+n−1)+n)=−(n^2−1).
- Consequently tr(H M^2)=tr(H D^2)+tr(H(DS+SD))+tr(H S^2)=Σ k z_k^2 − (n^2−1), because DS+SD has zero diagonal, so its contribution vanishes against diagonal H. This gives a concrete checkable value for tr(H M^2) under any z. (Nilpotency does not force tr(H M^2)=0, but this formula allows one to audit examples and derive further constraints when combined with other identities.)

Obstacles

- The general contradiction for arbitrary n likely requires combining several low-degree invariants (trace constraints tr(M^2)=0, tr(M^3)=0, possibly principal minor sums coming from the λ^{n−3} coefficient) with the linear relation Σ k z_k=0. We have established all necessary identities to carry this out for n=2,3 and provided universal identities (Lemma 1 and Corollary 2) to be re-used.
- A direct use of tr(H M^2) fails because nilpotency does not force it to vanish. One needs to exploit higher-order identities where Σ k z_k interacts nontrivially with fixed contributions from S.

Next steps

- Compute the sum of principal 3×3 principal minors (the λ^{n−3} coefficient) explicitly for general n. For our tridiagonal with equal-magnitude off-diagonals, one can show
  S_3 = Σ_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k + Σ_{1≤i≤n−2} (z_i) + Σ_{3≤k≤n} (z_k)
  = Σ_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k + (n−3) Σ_{r=1}^n z_r + (z_1+z_n),
  hence, using Σ z_i=0, nilpotency forces Σ_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k + (z_1+z_n)=0. This is consistent with tr(M^3)=0 above (Newton’s identities). The goal is to combine this with Σ k z_k=0 to force a contradiction for all n≥4.
- Push to the next coefficient (order 4) or to tr(M^4)=0 and express it via Σ z_i^4, Σ z_i^2, and fixed S-terms. With Σ z_i=0 and Σ k z_k=0, the resulting linear system in the symmetric sums should become inconsistent.
- Alternatively, use path counting to write closed forms for (M^{n+2})_{1n} and (M^{n+3})_{1n}; the linear part of (M^{n+3})_{1n} should be a nonzero multiple of Σ k z_k, yielding an immediate contradiction if M is nilpotent (so this entry must be 0) and Σ k z_k=0 is the only possible canceler of all lower-degree parts. We already verified the base counts and will formalize the general count in the next round.

Summary

- We established robust, reusable identities (endpoint entries of powers; low-degree trace formulas) and completely ruled out n=2 and n=3.
- We reduced the general problem to combining a handful of symmetric-sum identities (coming from tr(M^2)=tr(M^3)=0 and principal minor sums) with Σ k z_k=0. Two concrete routes are outlined: (i) advance the characteristic polynomial coefficient identities to order 4; (ii) complete a general path-count for (M^{n+3})_{1n} and extract the linear term in z, expected to be a nonzero multiple of Σ k z_k, giving the contradiction under nilpotency.
