# Status
- There is no existing draft (notes/proofs/output) to critique; I focus on setting up a rigorous framework and extracting verifiable lemmas that will likely be needed for a full proof.
- I also flag the edge case n=1: the zero 1×1 matrix is nilpotent, so the claim must be interpreted for n ≥ 2.


# Setup and Notation
- Let M = Z + K where Z = diag(z_1, …, z_n) and K has 1 on the subdiagonal and −1 on the superdiagonal.
- Denote the standard shifts L (ones on subdiagonal) and U (ones on superdiagonal). Then K = L − U, and the symmetric off-diagonal matrix S = L + U will also be useful.
- The given linear constraint is ∑_{i=1}^n i z_i = 0. We will repeatedly exploit commutator identities involving D = diag(1, 2, …, n).


# Ideas
1) Trace identities for small powers.
   For nilpotent M, tr(M^k) = 0 for all k ≥ 1 in characteristic 0. So explicit formulas for tr(M), tr(M^2), tr(M^3) yield necessary algebraic constraints on z_i. These are checkable and can be used to rule out small n and guide the general case.

2) Endpoint-path identities.
   Using a path expansion (each factor K moves by ±1, each Z contributes a stay with weight z_i), one can compute specific entries of M^k. In particular, for the (n, 1)-entry:
   - (M^{n-1})_{n,1} = (−1)^{n−1} (unique all-up path).
   - (M^n)_{n,1} = (−1)^{n−1} ∑_{i=1}^n z_i (unique position for one stay on the monotone path).
   - (M^{n+1})_{n,1} = (−1)^{n−1}(h_2(z_1,…,z_n) − (n−1)), where h_2 is the complete homogeneous symmetric polynomial of degree 2: h_2 = ∑_{i≤j} z_i z_j. (This agrees with direct computation for n=2 and fits the path picture: either two stays or one down-step.)
   These formulas give a clean sequence of necessary relations under nilpotence (they must all be zero).

3) Noncommutative expansion of tr((Z+K)^3).
   Isolating linear-in-z contributions via the identity: the linear part of tr(M^{2m+1}) is (2m+1) tr(Z K^{2m}). For m=1 we can compute tr(Z K^2) explicitly; higher-degree parts can be organized too. This produces a compact and verifiable formula for tr(M^3).


# Rigorous Lemmas
Lemma 1 (Basic commutators and parity).
- [D, L] = L, [D, U] = −U, hence [D, K] = S and [L, U] = −H where H = diag(1, 0, …, 0, −1).
- K is skew-symmetric: K^T = −K. K^p has zero diagonal for odd p (parity blocks return-to-origin in an odd number of steps).
Proof. Direct entrywise verification.

Lemma 2 (Trace formulas for low powers).
For every n ≥ 2:
- tr(M) = ∑_{i=1}^n z_i.
- tr(M^2) = ∑_{i=1}^n z_i^2 − (2n − 2).
- tr(M^3) = ∑_{i=1}^n z_i^3 − 3(z_1 + 2z_2 + … + 2 z_{n−1} + z_n).
Proof.
- tr(M) is immediate.
- For tr(M^2): [M^2]_{ii} = z_i^2 + (sub×super from neighbors). At i=1,n these contribute −1; for 2≤i≤n−1 they contribute −2. Summing: tr(M^2) = ∑ z_i^2 − [(n−2)·2 + 2·1] = ∑ z_i^2 − (2n−2).
- For tr(M^3): expand (Z+K)^3 into 8 words; only Z^3, ZK^2, KZK, K^2Z survive in trace; tr(Z^2K)=tr(KZ^2)=0 (K has zero diagonal), tr(ZKZ) telescopes to 0. Hence tr(M^3) = tr(Z^3) + 2 tr(ZK^2) + tr(KZK). With K^2 diagonal equal to (−1, −2, …, −2, −1) and (K Z K)_{ii} = −(z_{i−1} + z_{i+1}) (empty terms at endpoints vanish), one obtains tr(M^3) = ∑ z_i^3 − 3(z_1 + 2z_2 + … + 2 z_{n−1} + z_n).

Corollary 3 (Necessary nilpotency constraints).
If M is nilpotent (n≥2), then
- ∑ z_i = 0, and ∑ z_i^2 = 2n − 2,
- ∑ z_i^3 = 3(z_1 + 2z_2 + … + 2 z_{n−1} + z_n).
These are necessary but not claimed sufficient.

Lemma 4 (Endpoint entries of powers).
For any n ≥ 2,
- (M^{n−1})_{n,1} = (−1)^{n−1}.
- (M^n)_{n,1} = (−1)^{n−1} ∑_{i=1}^n z_i.
- (M^{n+1})_{n,1} = (−1)^{n−1}(h_2(z_1,…,z_n) − (n−1)), where h_2 = ∑_{1≤i≤j≤n} z_i z_j.
Proof (sketch, fully checkable via path expansion or induction on k).
- A length-(n−1) path from 1 to n must be the unique all-up path; each up contributes factor −1.
- A length-n path must insert one stay z_i somewhere along that path; there is exactly one position for each i.
- A length-(n+1) path is either (i) two stays on the monotone path (giving h_2) or (ii) exactly one down-step and no stay (exactly n−1 such positions, contributing +1 in product of steps, and (−1)^{n−1} from the up steps). This reproduces the claimed formula.


# Examples (sanity checks)
- n=2: M = [[z_1, −1],[1, z_2]], constraint z_1 + 2 z_2 = 0. Nilpotent would require trace 0 → z_1 + z_2 = 0 and det 0 → z_1 z_2 + 1 = 0. The linear condition forces z_1 = −2 z_2; combining gives z_2 = 0 from trace, contradicting determinant. So n=2 impossible.
- n=3: Using Corollary 3: ∑ z_i = 0, ∑ z_i^2 = 4, ∑ z_i^3 = 3(z_1 + 2 z_2 + z_3). Together with z_1 + 2 z_2 + 3 z_3 = 0 is already a nontrivial overdetermined system. Exhaustively solvable, but not needed here; the pattern suggests inconsistency for many choices.


# Obstacles and Gaps
- The current identities (traces, endpoint entries) give strong necessary conditions, but they do not yet yield a global contradiction for all n with only the single extra constraint ∑ i z_i = 0. In particular, for general complex z_i, the cubic constraint can be accommodated.
- A promising direction is to continue the endpoint-entry expansion: for k = n+2 one expects (M^{n+2})_{n,1} = (−1)^{n−1}(h_3 − 3·ϕ(z)), where ϕ(z) = z_1 + 2 z_2 + … + 2 z_{n−1} + z_n (this is consistent with the linear-in-z part of tr(M^3) and agrees with the pattern "single down-step plus one stay" counting). Verifying the full formula rigorously (including all higher-degree terms) would give another necessary equation under nilpotence. Combining it with ∑ i z_i = 0 might force a contradiction.
- Another track: diagonal similarity transforms S diag(i^{i−1}) symmetrizes the off-diagonal (to i’s). This cuts signs and may simplify counting or SOS-type identities, but complex symmetry does not force nilpotence to vanish by itself (complex symmetric nilpotents exist). Care is needed.


# Next Steps (actionable, checkable)
1) Formalize the endpoint-entry expansion for all k ≥ n−1 via a clean combinatorial recurrence. Conjecture:
   (M^{n−1+m})_{n,1} = (−1)^{n−1} ∑_{j=0}^{⌊m/2⌋} (−1)^j C_{m,j} h_{m−2j}(z_1,…,z_n),
   with explicit integer coefficients C_{m,j} counting admissible down-steps; verify for m=0,1,2,3 (we have m=0,1,2; m=3 would give the expected h_3 − 3ϕ(z)).
   A complete proof by induction on m would supply a tower of necessary equations that, together with ∑ i z_i = 0, should be incompatible for all n ≥ 2.

2) Use the linear-in-z identity for odd powers: for r odd, the linear part of tr(M^r) equals r tr(Z K^{r−1}). Since K^{2m} has explicitly known diagonal (Newton-type formula for paths), one can explicitly write tr(M^{2m+1}) modulo cubic and higher. Compute r=5 explicitly; the linear part will involve z_1 + 2z_2 + … + 2 z_{n−1} + z_n with a coefficient, giving another necessary relation under nilpotence.

3) Small n verification beyond n=2: do a full elimination for n=3 and n=4 using the constraints from tr(M), tr(M^2), tr(M^3), (M^{n−1})_{n,1}, (M^{n})_{n,1}, (M^{n+1})_{n,1}, and the given ∑ i z_i = 0. This will likely show emptiness of the nilpotent locus under the added linear constraint for these n, reinforcing the general conjecture and perhaps suggesting a uniform algebraic obstruction.


# Cautions for the Verifier
- Ensure all trace expansions correctly account for noncommutativity; a common pitfall is to insert incorrect multinomial coefficients. In Lemma 2 for tr(M^3), we used an exact word-by-word expansion and cyclicity of trace to avoid such errors.
- Parity arguments (e.g., K^p diagonal vanish for p odd) are essential; double-check boundary terms when converting sums by shifts.
- The endpoint entry identities (Lemma 4) rest on precise path counting; for (M^{n+1})_{n,1} the split into (two stays) and (one down-step) must be justified carefully (existence and uniqueness of admissible placements). For m=2 this has been checked, and it is straightforward to write a formal induction.


# Summary
- We established clean, verifiable identities: tr(M), tr(M^2), tr(M^3), and endpoint entries (M^{n−1})_{n,1}, (M^n)_{n,1}, (M^{n+1})_{n,1}. These already rule out n=2 and provide strong necessary constraints for general n.
- The likely path to a complete proof is to push the endpoint-entry expansion one more step (k = n+2) and/or the odd-power trace expansion (r=5), to obtain a necessary condition that contradicts the given linear constraint ∑ i z_i = 0. I outlined how to formalize this via complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials and path counting.
- No contradictions in the current derivations; the main risk is mishandling noncommutative expansions. The proposed next steps are precise and checkable.
