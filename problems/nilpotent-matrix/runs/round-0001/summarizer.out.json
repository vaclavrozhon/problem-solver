  "summary_md": "This round verified key structural identities for the tridiagonal matrix M (diagonal z_1..z_n, subdiagonal 1, superdiagonal \u22121) under the linear boundary constraint \u03a3 i z_i = 0. Proven/verified: [H,M]=E+F and the similarity flow; tr(M^2)=\u03a3 z_i^2 \u2212 2(n\u22121); tr(M^3)=\u03a3 z_i^3 \u2212 3\u03c6(z) with \u03c6=z_1+2z_2+\u22ef+2z_{n\u22121}+z_n. Endpoint path counts gave (M^{n\u22121})_{1n}=(-1)^{n\u22121}, (M^n)_{1n}=(-1)^{n\u22121}\u03a3 z_i, and (M^{n+1})_{1n}=(-1)^{n\u22121}(h_2\u2212(n\u22121)). From nilpotency we obtain \u03a3 z_i=0, \u03a3 z_i^2=2(n\u22121), h_2=n\u22121, and \u03a3 z_i^3=3\u03c6(z). Cases n=2,3 are ruled out by contradiction. Remaining plan: (i) prove a general formula for S_3 (sum of 3\u00d73 principal minors), (ii) derive an exact path-count formula for (M^{n+2})_{1n} (expected (\u22121)^{n\u22121}(h_3\u22123\u03c6)), and (iii) eliminate cubic terms to reach a linear boundary contradiction.
