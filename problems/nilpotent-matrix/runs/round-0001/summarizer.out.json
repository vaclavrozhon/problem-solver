  "summary_md": "Last round verified the continuant recurrence and boundary path-count identities and produced closed forms for low-order coefficients and traces. Explicit formulas were obtained for a_{n,1..4} and for tr(M^2), tr(M^3), tr(M^4) (with corrected factors and boundary terms). Using the boundary entry \u03b1_{n+2} together with nilpotency gave E_3=0 and hence z_1+z_n=0. The n=3 case under the weighted constraint z_1+2z_2+3z_3=0 was ruled out. It was shown a_{n,4} contains no weighted term \u2211 i z_i, so Newton identities make a_{n,4}=0 dependent on tr(M^2)=tr(M^4)=0 and not independently useful. Main remaining gap: no current identity truly uses the weighted constraint \u2211 i z_i=0. Next work should target W:=diag(1..n)-based trace identities or a kernel/Green approach to exploit the weighted sum and complete an induction.
