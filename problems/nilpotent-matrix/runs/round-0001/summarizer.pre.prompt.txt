# Tridiagonal nilpotency problem: structural identities and plan

Let M be the n×n tridiagonal matrix with diagonal Z = diag(z_1,…,z_n), ones on the subdiagonal (J), and −1 on the superdiagonal (−U). Thus M = Z + J − U. Define D = diag(1,2,…,n). Then
- [D,J] = J,
- [D,U] = −U,
- e^{−tD} M e^{tD} = Z + e^{−t} J − e^{t} U.
These are useful for similarity-invariant reasoning and path counting.

Basic trace identities (valid for all such M):
- trace(M) = ∑_{i=1}^n z_i.
- trace(M^2) = ∑_{i=1}^n z_i^2 − 2(n−1).
- trace(M^3) = ∑_{i=1}^n z_i^3 − 3(2∑_{i=1}^n z_i − (z_1 + z_n)).
If M were nilpotent, then trace(M^k) = 0 for k ≥ 1, hence ∑ z_i = 0 and ∑ z_i^2 = 2(n−1), etc.

Path-sum identities for the (n,1)-entry of powers (counting words in {J,Z,−U} that map e_1 → e_n while respecting boundaries):
- For k = n: (M^n)_{n,1} = ∑_{i=1}^n z_i. Reason: the only admissible words are those with exactly n−1 copies of J and one Z; the Z can occur at any intermediate index i.
- For k = n+1: (M^{n+1})_{n,1} = ∑_{1≤i≤j≤n} z_i z_j − (n−1). Reason: admissible words have either two Z’s and n−1 J’s (contributing ∑_{i≤j} z_i z_j) or one U and n J’s (there are exactly n−1 valid placements of the U; each contributes −1).
Under ∑ i z_i = 0, the identities for k = n and k = n+1 are compatible with trace(M) = 0 and trace(M^2) = 0 (since c_{n,2} = (n−1) + ∑_{i<j} z_i z_j = 0 is equivalent to ∑ z_i^2 = 2(n−1) when ∑ z_i = 0).

Outlook: To force a contradiction from the extra linear constraint ∑ i z_i = 0, we likely need the next identity (k = n+2). Admissible words now have either three Z’s and n−1 J’s, or one Z, one U, and n J’s. We expect a formula of the form
(M^{n+2})_{n,1} = e_3(z_1,…,z_n) − C_n · (∑_{i=1}^n i z_i),
for some explicit combinatorial constant C_n, obtained by counting valid placements of the single U relative to the single Z along the J-chain. If true, under ∑ i z_i = 0 and nilpotency ((M^{n+2})_{n,1} = 0) we get e_3(z) = 0. In tandem with trace(M^3) = 0 (which reads ∑ z_i^3 + 3(z_1 + z_n) = 0 when ∑ z_i = 0), this yields additional boundary constraints (e.g., z_1 + z_n = 0). Iterating to k = n+3 should overdetermine the system and show nonexistence for n ≥ 2.

Additional identities to verify/extend:
- A convenient constant identity: l^T M u = ∑_{i=1}^n i z_i − (n−1), where l = (1,…,1)^T and u = (1,2,…,n)^T.
- Higher traces: derive exact trace(M^4) (including boundary corrections) using A := J − U. One finds A^2 has diagonal entries −1 at i=1,n and −2 for 2≤i≤n−1, and trace(A^4) counts length-4 closed paths; preliminary count suggests trace(A^4) = 6n − 10 for n ≥ 3 (check carefully for small n and boundary cases). Then trace(M^4) = ∑ z_i^4 + 6∑ z_i^2 (A^2)_{ii} + trace(A^4).

Next steps for provers:
1) Prove rigorously the k = n+2 identity for (M^{n+2})_{n,1} and extract the coefficient of ∑ i z_i.
2) Establish trace(M^4) and c_{n,4} via Faddeev–LeVerrier; compare against the k = n+2 entry identity.
3) Use these to derive an explicit contradiction under ∑ i z_i = 0 and nilpotency.

Remark: The case n = 1 is a trivial nilpotent (z_1 = 0); the statement to be proved should assume n ≥ 2.


Setup and notation
- M = D + L − U with D = diag(z_1,…,z_n), L the lower shift (ones on the subdiagonal), U the upper shift (ones on the superdiagonal).
- W = diag(1,2,…,n). Define J := L + U and S := L − U.

Key identities we will use
- Commutators: [W, M] = L + U; [L, M] = [L, D] + E_{1,1} − E_{n,n}, where [L,D] has entries ([L,D])_{i+1,i} = z_i − z_{i+1}.
- Boundary entries of powers (1 ≤ k ≤ n):
  • (M^k)_{k,1} = ∑_{j=1}^k z_j; and for 0 ≤ k ≤ n−1, (M^k)_{k+1,1} = 1.
  • (M^k)_{n−k+1,n} = (−1)^{k−1} ∑_{j=n−k+1}^n z_j.
- Weighted sum relations:
  • ∑_{i=1}^n i z_i = ∑_{k=1}^n T_k with T_k = ∑_{j=n−k+1}^n z_j = (−1)^{k−1} (M^k)_{n−k+1,n}.
  • ∑_{k=1}^n S_k with S_k = ∑_{j=1}^k z_j equals (n+1)∑ z_i − ∑ i z_i. Hence if tr(M)=∑ z_i=0 (e.g., under nilpotency), then ∑_{k=1}^n S_k = −∑ i z_i = −∑_{k=1}^n (−1)^{k−1} (M^k)_{n−k+1,n}.
- Trace constraints: tr(M^2) = ∑ z_i^2 − 2(n−1); tr(M^3) = ∑ z_i^3 + 3(z_1 + z_n). Under nilpotency these vanish, giving ∑ z_i^2 = 2(n−1), ∑ z_i^3 = −3(z_1 + z_n).
- Additional continuant/coefficients facts (to be formalized): the λ^{n−3} coefficient identity implies e_3 = −(z_1 + z_n) when e_1=0; this matches tr(M^3).

Checked case and corrections
- n = 3: a direct coefficient analysis shows the weighted constraint is incompatible with nilpotency (see proofs.md for a complete argument).
- Correction: the equality ∑ i z_i = ∑_{k=1}^n S_k is false in general; it holds up to a sign only when ∑ z_i = 0. The right-edge identity ∑ i z_i = ∑_{k=1}^n T_k is exact.
- The claim that all principal cofactors C_{ii}(0) vanish under Δ_n(λ)=λ^n is false; do not use Δ_{i−1}(0) Δ^{(i+1)}_{n−i}(0) = 0.

Next steps
- Compute tr(M^4) and optionally tr(M^5) explicitly; combine with the commutator identities 0 = tr([L,M] M^{k−1}) for k=1,… to obtain additional independent constraints.
- Derive the λ^{n−4} coefficient in closed form via matchings and combine with e_1=0, e_2=−(n−1), e_3=−(z_1+z_n) and ∑ i z_i=0.
- Prototype an edge-peeling induction (e.g., eliminate z_1, z_n via the two linear equations and analyze a reduced tridiagonal system) and test it for n=4,5.


Added progress and corrections summary.

- We verified the continuant recurrence for P_k(λ) = det(λ I − M_{[k]}): P_k = (λ − z_k) P_{k−1} + P_{k−2}, with P_0 = 1, P_1 = λ − z_1. From this we confirmed:
  • a_{k,1} = −∑_{j ≤ k} z_j.
  • a_{k,2} = ∑_{1≤i<j≤k} z_i z_j + (k − 1).
  • a_{k,3} = −∑_{1≤i<j<ℓ≤k} z_i z_j z_ℓ − (k − 3)∑_{j ≤ k} z_j − (z_1 + z_k).
- Low-order traces: tr(M^2) = ∑ z_i^2 − 2(n − 1), tr(M^3) = ∑ z_i^3 − 6∑ z_i + 3(z_1 + z_n).
- Under nilpotency (M^n = 0): a_{n,1} = a_{n,2} = a_{n,3} = 0 ⇒ ∑ z_i = 0, ∑_{i<j} z_i z_j = −(n − 1), ∑_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k = −(z_1 + z_n). Also tr(M^2) = tr(M^3) = 0. Using α_{n+2} (see below) in fact enforces z_1 + z_n = 0 and hence E_3 = 0.
- Path counting (boundary-to-boundary entries): α_{n−1} = 1, α_n = ∑ z_i, α_{n+1} = ∑_{i≤j} z_i z_j − (n − 1), α_{n+2} = ∑_{i≤j≤k} z_i z_j z_k − (n − 1)∑ z_i. With S = ∑ z_i = 0, α_{n+2} = h_3 = (2/3)∑ z_i^3 − E_3. Since tr(M^3) = 0 gives ∑ z_i^3 + 3E_3 = 0, we get α_{n+2} = −3E_3. Nilpotency implies α_{n+2} = 0 ⇒ E_3 = 0 ⇒ z_1 + z_n = 0. (This corrects a factor-3 slip in an earlier note.)
- New explicit formulas:
  • Fourth coefficient: a_{n,4} = E_4 + (n − 5) E_2 + [∑_{j=1}^{n−1} z_j z_{j+1}] − (z_1^2 + z_n^2) + (n − 3)(n − 2)/2. In particular, there is no ∑ k z_k term.
  • tr(M^4) = ∑ z_i^4 − 8∑ z_i^2 + 4(z_1^2 + z_n^2) − 4∑_{j=1}^{n−1} z_j z_{j+1} + (6n − 10).
  Under nilpotency, tr(M^2) = tr(M^4) = 0.
- Observation: Newton identities show a_{n,4} is determined by tr(M^2), tr(M^4). Thus a_{n,4} = 0 brings no new constraint beyond tr(M^2) = tr(M^4) = 0 when M is nilpotent.
- Critical gap: None of the current identities truly use the weighted constraint ∑ k z_k = 0. Coefficients/traces and α_{n+q} depend on symmetric sums and boundary effects (z_1, z_n) and adjacent products, but we do not see an index-weighted linear term emerge. We need identities explicitly involving J = diag(1,2,…,n). Candidates: tr(J M^r) expansions, and a kernel-vector approach for M v = 0 combined with discrete summation by parts and ∑ k z_k = 0.

# Main Results




=== Verifier Summary ===

We validated the continuant recurrence and derived correct formulas for a_{n,1}, a_{n,2}, a_{n,3}, as well as tr(M^2), tr(M^3). Using α_{n+2}=0 under nilpotency gives E_3=0 and hence z_1+z_n=0. We computed and added rigorous formulas for a_{n,4} and tr(M^4): a_{n,4} contains no ∑ k z_k term (contrary to Prover 1’s claim) and is not independent of low-order traces by Newton’s identities. We also corrected a factor-3 slip in Prover 1’s α_{n+2} check and flagged Prover 2’s cofactor propagation as invalid and c_{n−4} sign/counting as suspect. Main obstacle: no current identity truly leverages the weighted constraint ∑ k z_k = 0. Next steps: derive J-based trace identities (e.g., tr(J M^r)) or a kernel-vector/Green’s identity approach that uses ∑ k z_k = 0; Prover 2 to deliver a correct c_{n−4} formula.

# Tridiagonal nilpotency problem: structural identities and plan

Let M be the n×n tridiagonal matrix with diagonal Z = diag(z_1,…,z_n), ones on the subdiagonal (J), and −1 on the superdiagonal (−U). Thus M = Z + J − U. Define D = diag(1,2,…,n). Then
- [D,J] = J,
- [D,U] = −U,
- e^{−tD} M e^{tD} = Z + e^{−t} J − e^{t} U.
These are useful for similarity-invariant reasoning and path counting.

Basic trace identities (valid for all such M):
- trace(M) = ∑_{i=1}^n z_i.
- trace(M^2) = ∑_{i=1}^n z_i^2 − 2(n−1).
- trace(M^3) = ∑_{i=1}^n z_i^3 − 3(2∑_{i=1}^n z_i − (z_1 + z_n)).
If M were nilpotent, then trace(M^k) = 0 for k ≥ 1, hence ∑ z_i = 0 and ∑ z_i^2 = 2(n−1), etc.

Path-sum identities for the (n,1)-entry of powers (counting words in {J,Z,−U} that map e_1 → e_n while respecting boundaries):
- For k = n: (M^n)_{n,1} = ∑_{i=1}^n z_i. Reason: the only admissible words are those with exactly n−1 copies of J and one Z; the Z can occur at any intermediate index i.
- For k = n+1: (M^{n+1})_{n,1} = ∑_{1≤i≤j≤n} z_i z_j − (n−1). Reason: admissible words have either two Z’s and n−1 J’s (contributing ∑_{i≤j} z_i z_j) or one U and n J’s (there are exactly n−1 valid placements of the U; each contributes −1).
Under ∑ i z_i = 0, the identities for k = n and k = n+1 are compatible with trace(M) = 0 and trace(M^2) = 0 (since c_{n,2} = (n−1) + ∑_{i<j} z_i z_j = 0 is equivalent to ∑ z_i^2 = 2(n−1) when ∑ z_i = 0).

Outlook: To force a contradiction from the extra linear constraint ∑ i z_i = 0, we likely need the next identity (k = n+2). Admissible words now have either three Z’s and n−1 J’s, or one Z, one U, and n J’s. We expect a formula of the form
(M^{n+2})_{n,1} = e_3(z_1,…,z_n) − C_n · (∑_{i=1}^n i z_i),
for some explicit combinatorial constant C_n, obtained by counting valid placements of the single U relative to the single Z along the J-chain. If true, under ∑ i z_i = 0 and nilpotency ((M^{n+2})_{n,1} = 0) we get e_3(z) = 0. In tandem with trace(M^3) = 0 (which reads ∑ z_i^3 + 3(z_1 + z_n) = 0 when ∑ z_i = 0), this yields additional boundary constraints (e.g., z_1 + z_n = 0). Iterating to k = n+3 should overdetermine the system and show nonexistence for n ≥ 2.

Additional identities to verify/extend:
- A convenient constant identity: l^T M u = ∑_{i=1}^n i z_i − (n−1), where l = (1,…,1)^T and u = (1,2,…,n)^T.
- Higher traces: derive exact trace(M^4) (including boundary corrections) using A := J − U. One finds A^2 has diagonal entries −1 at i=1,n and −2 for 2≤i≤n−1, and trace(A^4) counts length-4 closed paths; preliminary count suggests trace(A^4) = 6n − 10 for n ≥ 3 (check carefully for small n and boundary cases). Then trace(M^4) = ∑ z_i^4 + 6∑ z_i^2 (A^2)_{ii} + trace(A^4).

Next steps for provers:
1) Prove rigorously the k = n+2 identity for (M^{n+2})_{n,1} and extract the coefficient of ∑ i z_i.
2) Establish trace(M^4) and c_{n,4} via Faddeev–LeVerrier; compare against the k = n+2 entry identity.
3) Use these to derive an explicit contradiction under ∑ i z_i = 0 and nilpotency.

Remark: The case n = 1 is a trivial nilpotent (z_1 = 0); the statement to be proved should assume n ≥ 2.

  • ∑_{k=1}^n S_k with S_k = ∑_{j=1}^k z_j equals (n+1)∑ z_i − ∑ i z_i. Hence if tr(M)=∑ z_i=0 (e.g., under nilpotency), then ∑_{k=1}^n S_k = −∑ i z_i = −∑_{k=1}^n (−1)^{k−1} (M^k)_{n−k+1,n}.
- Trace constraints: tr(M^2) = ∑ z_i^2 − 2(n−1); tr(M^3) = ∑ z_i^3 + 3(z_1 + z_n). Under nilpotency these vanish, giving ∑ z_i^2 = 2(n−1), ∑ z_i^3 = −3(z_1 + z_n).

- The claim that all principal cofactors C_{ii}(0) vanish under Δ_n(λ)=λ^n is false; do not use Δ_{i−1}(0) Δ^{(i+1)}_{n−i}(0) = 0.

Added progress and corrections summary.

- We verified the continuant recurrence for P_k(λ) = det(λ I − M_{[k]}): P_k = (λ − z_k) P_{k−1} + P_{k−2}, with P_0 = 1, P_1 = λ − z_1. From this we confirmed:
  • a_{k,1} = −∑_{j ≤ k} z_j.
  • a_{k,2} = ∑_{1≤i<j≤k} z_i z_j + (k − 1).
  • a_{k,3} = −∑_{1≤i<j<ℓ≤k} z_i z_j z_ℓ − (k − 3)∑_{j ≤ k} z_j − (z_1 + z_k).
- Low-order traces: tr(M^2) = ∑ z_i^2 − 2(n − 1), tr(M^3) = ∑ z_i^3 − 6∑ z_i + 3(z_1 + z_n).
- Under nilpotency (M^n = 0): a_{n,1} = a_{n,2} = a_{n,3} = 0 ⇒ ∑ z_i = 0, ∑_{i<j} z_i z_j = −(n − 1), ∑_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k = −(z_1 + z_n). Also tr(M^2) = tr(M^3) = 0. Using α_{n+2} (see below) in fact enforces z_1 + z_n = 0 and hence E_3 = 0.

  Under nilpotency, tr(M^2) = tr(M^4) = 0.
- Observation: Newton identities show a_{n,4} is determined by tr(M^2), tr(M^4). Thus a_{n,4} = 0 brings no new constraint beyond tr(M^2) = tr(M^4) = 0 when M is nilpotent.
- Critical gap: None of the current identities truly use the weighted constraint ∑ k z_k = 0. Coefficients/traces and α_{n+q} depend on symmetric sums and boundary effects (z_1, z_n) and adjacent products, but we do not see an index-weighted linear term emerge.

# Rigorous Proofs



Definitions
Let n ≥ 2 and let M ∈ C^{n×n} be tridiagonal with diagonal entries z_1,…,z_n, subdiagonal entries 1, and superdiagonal entries −1. Write D = diag(z_1,…,z_n). Let L be the lower shift (L_{i+1,i} = 1), U the upper shift (U_{i,i+1} = 1). Then M = D + L − U. Let W = diag(1,2,…,n). We use the standard matrix units E_{ij}.

1) Commutator identities
Lemma 1. [W, M] = L + U.
Proof. Since [W,D] = 0 and [W,L] has entries ([W,L])_{i+1,i} = (i+1 − i) = 1, we get [W,L] = L. Similarly ([W,U])_{i,i+1} = (i − (i+1)) = −1, hence [W,−U] = −[W,U] = U. Thus [W,M] = [W,L] + [W,−U] = L + U.

Lemma 2. [L, M] = [L, D] + E_{1,1} − E_{n,n}, where [L, D] is strictly lower bidiagonal with ([L,D])_{i+1,i} = z_i − z_{i+1}.
Proof. Directly, ([L,D])_{i+1,i} = L_{i+1,i} z_i − z_{i+1} L_{i+1,i} = z_i − z_{i+1}. Also [L, L] = 0 and [L, −U] = −[L,U]. Since (LU)_{ii} = 1 for i ≥ 2 and (UL)_{ii} = 1 for i ≤ n−1, we have [L,U] = LU − UL = −E_{1,1} + E_{n,n}. Therefore [L, −U] = E_{1,1} − E_{n,n}, giving [L,M] = [L,D] + E_{1,1} − E_{n,n}.

Corollary 3. For every k ≥ 1, tr((L+U) M^{k−1}) = 0 and tr([L, M] M^{k−1}) = 0.
Proof. For any k ≥ 1, [W, M^k] = ∑_{j=0}^{k−1} M^j [W,M] M^{k−1−j}. Taking traces and using cyclicity yields k·tr([W,M] M^{k−1}) = 0; hence tr((L+U) M^{k−1})=0 by Lemma 1. Similarly 0 = tr([L, M^k]) = k·tr([L, M] M^{k−1}).

The identity tr([L,M] M^{k−1}) = 0 expands as
(∗)  (M^{k−1})_{1,1} − (M^{k−1})_{n,n} + ∑_{i=1}^{n−1} (z_i − z_{i+1}) (M^{k−1})_{i, i+1} = 0.

2) Boundary entries of powers
Lemma 4. For 0 ≤ k ≤ n−1, (M^k)_{k+1,1} = 1.
Proof. In a length-k product, the only way to move from column 1 to row k+1 is to take exactly k steps of L (each of weight 1). Any U-step would require an extra L-step to compensate and exceed the budget, and any D-step would reduce the number of L-steps but cannot be offset. Hence the unique admissible path has weight 1.

Lemma 5. For 1 ≤ k ≤ n, (M^k)_{k,1} = ∑_{j=1}^k z_j.
Proof. Let the numbers of L, U, D-steps be ℓ,u,d with ℓ − u = k − 1 and ℓ + u + d = k; thus 2u + d = 1. The only nonnegative solution is u = 0, d = 1, ℓ = k − 1. The unique position of the D-step can be any s ∈ {1,…,k}. At that moment the current index equals s, contributing z_s; all L-steps have weight 1. Summing over s gives the claim.

Lemma 6. For 1 ≤ k ≤ n, (M^k)_{n−k+1,n} = (−1)^{k−1} ∑_{j=n−k+1}^n z_j.
Proof. Now ℓ − u = −(k − 1) and ℓ + u + d = k, hence 2ℓ + d = 1. Thus ℓ = 0, d = 1, u = k − 1. Each U-step contributes a factor −1, hence the sign (−1)^{k−1}. The D-step can occur at any of the k positions, at height n − r after r U-steps, contributing z_{n−r}. Summing yields the suffix sum.

Corollary 7 (weighted sums via boundary entries). Let S_k = ∑_{j=1}^k z_j and T_k = ∑_{j=n−k+1}^n z_j. Then
- ∑_{k=1}^n T_k = ∑_{i=1}^n i z_i = ∑_{k=1}^n (−1)^{k−1} (M^k)_{n−k+1,n}.
- ∑_{k=1}^n S_k = (n+1)∑_{i=1}^n z_i − ∑_{i=1}^n i z_i = ∑_{k=1}^n (M^k)_{k,1}.
In particular, if tr(M)=0 then ∑_{k=1}^n (M^k)_{k,1} = −∑_{i=1}^n i z_i.
Proof. The combinatorial equalities for ∑ T_k and ∑ S_k are standard double-counting of coefficients. The boundary-entry expressions follow from Lemmas 5–6.

3) Low-order trace identities
Lemma 8. tr(M^2) = ∑_{i=1}^n z_i^2 − 2(n−1).
Proof. Write M = D + S with S = L − U, which has zero diagonal. Then tr(M^2) = tr(D^2) + tr(S^2). The diagonal of S^2 equals −1 at i=1,n and −2 at interior indices. Summing gives tr(S^2) = −2(n−1).

Lemma 9. tr(M^3) = ∑_{i=1}^n z_i^3 + 3(z_1 + z_n).
Proof. Expanding (D+S)^3 and using trace-cyclicity,
tr(M^3) = tr(D^3) + tr(D^2 S + D S D + S D^2) + tr(D S^2 + S D S + S^2 D) + tr(S^3).
The sum with one S vanishes since S has zero diagonal. The middle sum equals 3 tr(D S^2) by cyclicity. Since diag(S^2) is −1 at i=1,n and −2 otherwise, tr(D S^2) = −z_1 − 2∑_{i=2}^{n−1} z_i − z_n. Hence tr(M^3) = ∑ z_i^3 − 3z_1 − 6∑_{i=2}^{n−1} z_i − 3z_n = ∑ z_i^3 + 3(z_1 + z_n) once we use ∑ z_i = (z_1 + z_n) + ∑_{i=2}^{n−1} z_i.

Corollary 10 (nilpotency constraints). If M is nilpotent, then tr(M^k)=0 for all k ≥ 1, and in particular
∑_{i=1}^n z_i = 0,
∑_{i=1}^n z_i^2 = 2(n−1),
∑_{i=1}^n z_i^3 = −3(z_1 + z_n).

4) The case n = 3 under the weighted constraint
Theorem 11. For n = 3, there is no nilpotent M with z_1 + 2 z_2 + 3 z_3 = 0.
Proof. Nilpotency enforces: (i) z_1 + z_2 + z_3 = 0; (ii) the sum of principal 2×2 minors equals 0, i.e., z_1 z_2 + z_1 z_3 + z_2 z_3 + 2 = 0; (iii) det(M) = z_1 z_2 z_3 + z_1 + z_3 = 0. The weighted constraint gives z_1 + 2 z_2 + 3 z_3 = 0. Subtracting (i) from the weighted equation yields z_2 + 2 z_3 = 0, so z_2 = −2 z_3. Then (i) gives z_1 = z_3. Substituting into (iii): z_1 z_2 z_3 + z_1 + z_3 = −2 z_3^3 + 2 z_3 = 0, so z_3 ∈ {0, ±1}. If z_3 = 0 then z_1 = z_2 = 0 contradicting (ii). If z_3 = ±1, then z_1 = ±1 and z_2 = ∓2; inserting into (ii) yields (±1)(∓2) + (±1)(±1) + (∓2)(±1) + 2 = −1 ≠ 0, a contradiction. Thus no nilpotent solution exists.

Remarks. Corollary 7 translates the weighted sum into a boundary-sum of powers of M. Together with (∗) and the low-degree trace identities, these provide a growing set of constraints that can be exploited for larger n.


Lemma A (Fourth coefficient a_{n,4}).
Let P_k(λ) = det(λ I − M_{[k]}) = λ^k + a_{k,1} λ^{k−1} + a_{k,2} λ^{k−2} + a_{k,3} λ^{k−3} + a_{k,4} λ^{k−4} + ⋯, where M_{[k]} is the leading k×k principal submatrix. Then for k ≥ 4,
 a_{k,4} = a_{k−1,4} − z_k a_{k−1,3} + a_{k−2,2}.
With a_{m,1} = −S_m, a_{m,2} = E_2^{(m)} + (m − 1), a_{m,3} = −E_3^{(m)} − (m − 3) S_m − (z_1 + z_m), summing from k = 4 to n yields the closed form
 a_{n,4} = E_4 + (n − 5) E_2 + \sum_{j=1}^{n−1} z_j z_{j+1} − (z_1^2 + z_n^2) + (n − 3)(n − 2)/2.
Here S_m = ∑_{i=1}^m z_i, E_r^{(m)} is the r-th elementary symmetric sum in z_1,…,z_m, and E_r = E_r^{(n)}.

Proof. The recurrence for P_k implies a_{k,4} = a_{k−1,4} − z_k a_{k−1,3} + a_{k−2,2}. Using the explicit formulas for a_{k−1,3}, a_{k−2,2} and telescoping from k=4 to n gives
 a_{n,4} = \sum_{k=4}^n [ z_k E_3^{(k−1)} + (k−4) z_k S_{k−1} + z_k (z_1 + z_{k−1}) + E_2^{(k−2)} + (k−3) ].
Now ∑_{k=4}^n z_k E_3^{(k−1)} = E_4. Next, ∑_{k=4}^n (k−3) = (n − 3)(n − 2)/2, and ∑_{k=4}^n z_k z_{k−1} = ∑_{j=3}^{n−1} z_j z_{j+1}. Also ∑_{k=4}^n z_1 z_k = z_1 (S − z_1 − z_2 − z_3). For the partial 2-sums,
 ∑_{k=4}^n E_2^{(k−2)} = ∑_{m=2}^{n−2} E_2^{(m)} = ∑_{j=2}^{n−2} (n − 1 − j) z_j S_{j−1}
(using E_2^{(m)} = ∑_{j=2}^m z_j S_{j−1}). Combining with ∑_{k=4}^n (k−4) z_k S_{k−1} and reorganizing yields
 ∑_{k=4}^n [(k−4) z_k S_{k−1}] + ∑_{m=2}^{n−2} E_2^{(m)} = (n − 5) E_2 + [2 z_1 z_2 + z_1 z_3 + z_2 z_3 + z_n S − z_n^2].
Collecting all terms and simplifying gives the stated formula
 a_{n,4} = E_4 + (n − 5) E_2 + \sum_{j=1}^{n−1} z_j z_{j+1} − (z_1^2 + z_n^2) + (n − 3)(n − 2)/2.
∎

Remark. There is no ∑ k z_k term in a_{n,4}. By Newton’s identities, under nilpotency we have tr(M^2) = tr(M^4) = 0, and a_{n,4} = 0 provides no independent constraint.

Lemma B (Trace of M^4).
For M = D + N with D = diag(z_1,…,z_n) and N the tridiagonal skew-symmetric (1 on subdiagonal, −1 on superdiagonal),
 tr(M^4) = ∑_{i=1}^n z_i^4 − 8∑_{i=1}^n z_i^2 + 4(z_1^2 + z_n^2) − 4∑_{i=1}^{n−1} z_i z_{i+1} + (6n − 10).

Proof. In the trace expansion of (D+N)^4, terms with an odd number of N’s have zero trace (either because they have a factor with zero diagonal or reduce to tr(D N^3) with N^3 skew-symmetric). Thus
 tr(M^4) = tr(D^4) + 4 tr(D^2 N^2) + 2 tr(D N D N) + tr(N^4).
Now tr(D^4) = ∑ z_i^4. Since N^2 has diagonal (−1, −2, …, −2, −1), tr(D^2 N^2) = ∑ z_i^2 (N^2)_{ii} = −2∑ z_i^2 + z_1^2 + z_n^2.
Moreover, tr(D N D N) = ∑_{i,j} z_i N_{ij} z_j N_{ji} = −2∑_{i=1}^{n−1} z_i z_{i+1} (only nearest neighbors contribute). Finally, N^2 has off-diagonals at distance two with 1’s, so (N^4)_{ii} = (N^2)_{ii}^2 plus two off-distance contributions when available; a direct count yields diag(N^4): 2 at i=1,n; 5 at i=2,n−1; and 6 otherwise. Hence tr(N^4) = 2+2+5+5+6(n−4) = 6n−10. Substituting and simplifying gives the formula.
