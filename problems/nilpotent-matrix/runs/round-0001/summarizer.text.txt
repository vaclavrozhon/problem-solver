{"summary_md":"This round verified key structural identities for the tridiagonal matrix M (diagonal z_1..z_n, subdiagonal 1, superdiagonal −1) under the linear boundary constraint Σ i z_i = 0. Proven/verified: [H,M]=E+F and the similarity flow; tr(M^2)=Σ z_i^2 − 2(n−1); tr(M^3)=Σ z_i^3 − 3φ(z) with φ=z_1+2z_2+⋯+2z_{n−1}+z_n. Endpoint path counts gave (M^{n−1})_{1n}=(-1)^{n−1}, (M^n)_{1n}=(-1)^{n−1}Σ z_i, and (M^{n+1})_{1n}=(-1)^{n−1}(h_2−(n−1)). From nilpotency we obtain Σ z_i=0, Σ z_i^2=2(n−1), h_2=n−1, and Σ z_i^3=3φ(z). Cases n=2,3 are ruled out by contradiction. Remaining plan: (i) prove a general formula for S_3 (sum of 3×3 principal minors), (ii) derive an exact path-count formula for (M^{n+2})_{1n} (expected (−1)^{n−1}(h_3−3φ)), and (iii) eliminate cubic terms to reach a linear boundary contradiction.
