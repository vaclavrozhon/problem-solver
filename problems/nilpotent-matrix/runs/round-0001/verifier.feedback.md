Overall: both provers established several correct, reusable identities (characteristic polynomial recurrence, first few coefficients, and low-order trace relations). However, neither prover produced a contradiction using the weighted constraint ∑ k z_k = 0. There are also some inaccuracies that must be corrected before proceeding.

Key correctness checks and fixes:
- Prover 1: Lemma 1 (coefficients a_{k,1}, a_{k,2}, a_{k,3}) is correct; the tridiagonal determinant recurrence P_k = (λ − z_k) P_{k−1} + P_{k−2} is valid for this band pattern. Lemma 3 (traces tr(M^2), tr(M^3)) is also correct, with diag(N^2) = (−1, −2, …, −2, −1). The path-counting for α_{n−1}, α_n, α_{n+1}, α_{n+2} is fine in spirit. However, in the “consistency check” you miscomputed a factor: with S = 0, α_{n+2} = (2/3)∑ z_j^3 − E_3 and ∑ z_j^3 + 3E_3 = 0 imply α_{n+2} = −3E_3 (not −E_3). Since nilpotency forces M^n = 0, we do have α_{n+2} = 0, hence E_3 = 0 and thus z_1 + z_n = 0; the final conclusion remains correct, but the displayed intermediate equality is off by a factor 3.
- Crucially, the strategic claim that a weighted term C·∑ k z_k appears in a_{n,4} is false. We computed a closed form for a_{n,4} and found no ∑ k z_k term (see proofs update). Moreover, by Newton’s identities c_4 is an explicit combination of tr(M^2), tr(M^4); under nilpotency both vanish, so a_{n,4} = 0 carries no new information beyond tr(M^2)=tr(M^4)=0.
- Prover 2: The λ^{n−3} coefficient identity via matchings is correct and matches Prover 1. The Wronskian-type identity T_n(0)=0 yielding 1 − α_1^2 + α_2^2 − ⋯ + (−1)^{n−1} α_{n−1}^2 = 0 is correct and useful. However, the cofactor-vanishing claim is wrong: Δ_n'(0) = 0 only implies the sum of diagonal cofactors vanishes, not that each cofactor (or its two continuant factors) vanishes. Also, your suggested formula c_{n−4} = e_4 − Q + m_2 has a sign issue: contributions from one-edge matchings to λ^{n−4} enter with a positive sign (not negative). The reduction Q = (n−4) e_2 + ∑ z_i z_{i+1} is not justified and appears incorrect.

What is solid now:
- Verified coefficient identities a_{n,1}, a_{n,2}, a_{n,3}, and the consequences under nilpotency: S=0, E_2=−(n−1), E_3=−(z_1+z_n), and in fact E_3=0 ⇒ z_1+z_n=0 by using α_{n+2}=0.
- Verified low-order trace identities tr(M^2), tr(M^3); and we add tr(M^4) explicitly in proofs.
- New: a precise, closed formula for a_{n,4} (no ∑ k z_k term), and tr(M^4) (a concrete identity in z’s and adjacent products).

Blocking conceptual issue: None of the identities derived so far meaningfully leverage the weighted constraint ∑ k z_k = 0. Pursuing higher coefficients/α-entries alone will not introduce that weight naturally; those expressions depend on symmetric sums and boundary terms (z_1, z_n, adjacent products), not on the index-weighted linear functional.

Concrete next steps:
1) Abandon the expectation that a_{n,4} yields a ∑ k z_k term. Instead, derive and exploit identities that explicitly involve J = diag(1,…,n). Promising directions:
   - Compute tr(J M^r) for small r (especially r = 1,2,3) in terms of z’s and constants (we provide tr(J M^2) structure in notes). Try to combine tr(J M^r) with nilpotency constraints tr(M^s)=0 and commutator relations [J, M] = U to force linear relations such as ∑ k z_k = 0 ⇒ incompatible with other identities.
   - Use kernel-vector approach: if M is nilpotent, there exists 0 ≠ v with M v = 0. The recurrence v_{i+1} = z_i v_i + v_{i−1} (Dirichlet boundaries v_0 = v_{n+1} = 0) combined with ∑ i z_i = 0 might yield an obstruction via discrete integration by parts, e.g., pairing with the sequence i and summing.
2) Prover 2: Provide a correct, fully derived formula for c_{n−4} via matchings (with correct signs and explicit, verifiable combinatorics). Check whether boundary-sensitive terms (z_1, z_n) and nearest-neighbor sums emerge, and test if they can be combined with tr(J M) = 0.
3) Explore a general closed form for α_{n+q} as a combination of complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials h_{q−2s} with coefficients equal to counts of s-edge matchings on P_{n−1}. This will clarify systematically that index-weighted sums do not appear in α_{n+q}, steering efforts toward J-based trace/variational methods.

Until a mechanism that truly uses ∑ k z_k = 0 is found, a full contradiction seems out of reach.
