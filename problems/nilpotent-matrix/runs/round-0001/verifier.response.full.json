(M^{n})_{1n}=(\u22121)^{n\u22121} \u03a3 z_i (exactly one stay). (M^{n+1})_{1n}=(\u22121)^{n\u22121}(h_2(z) \u2212 (n\u22121)) where h_2=\u03a3_{i\u2264j} z_i z_j (two stays or one down step).\\n- Consequence for nilpotent M: tr(M^k)=0 for all k\u22651, hence \u03a3 z_i=0 and \u03a3 z_i^2=2(n\u22121), and \u03a3 z_i^3=3(z_1+2\u22ef+2+z_n). Also (M^{n+1})_{1n}=0 gives h_2 = n\u22121, consistent with \u03a3 z_i^2=2(n\u22121) since h_2 = (\u03a3 z_i^2 + (\u03a3 z_i)^2)/2.\\n\\nSmall n resolved. For n=2 and n=3, imposing \u03a3 i z_i=0 together with nilpotency constraints leads to contradictions; hence no nilpotent matrix of the prescribed form exists for n\u22643.\\n\\n3\u00d73 principal minors (status). For n=4, a direct computation shows the sum of all 3\u00d73 principal minors equals \u03a3_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k + (2 z_1 + z_2 + z_3 + 2 z_4). This matches the general ansatz S_3 = \u03a3_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k + (n\u22123) \u03a3 z_i + (z_1+z_n) (which reduces for n=4 to 2z_1+z_2+z_3+2z_4). We need a uniform proof for all n.\\n\\nPlanned route to contradiction.\\n1) Prove the general formula for S_3: S_3 = \u03a3_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k + (n\u22123) \u03a3 z_i + (z_1+z_n). Under nilpotency, e_3=S_3=0, thus with \u03a3 z_i=0 we get \u03a3_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k = \u2212(z_1+z_n).\\n2) Compute (M^{n+2})_{1n} exactly by path counting. Expect: (\u22121)^{n\u22121}(h_3(z) \u2212 3\u03c6(z)), where \u03c6(z)=z_1+2z_2+\u22ef+2 z_{n\u22121}+z_n. Nilpotency forces (M^{n+2})_{1n}=0, hence h_3=3\u03c6.\\n3) Eliminate the cubic quantities using identities relating h_3 and \u03a3_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k, together with \u03a3 z_i=0 and \u03a3 z_i^2=2(n\u22121), to isolate a nonzero linear boundary form that contradicts \u03a3 i z_i=0.\\n\\nAction items for next round.\\n- Prover 2: Supply a complete proof of the S_3 formula for all n.\\n- Prover 3: Prove the exact formula for (M^{n+2})_{1n}, including the \u22123 coefficient on \u03c6(z).\\n- Prover 1: Cross-verify both identities, correct the earlier weight sketch for c_{n,3}, and attempt the elimination for n=4 to confirm inconsistency before generalizing.\"},\"proofs_update\":{\"action\":\"append\",\"content\":\"Setup. Let n\u22652. Let M be the n\u00d7n tridiagonal matrix with diagonal entries z_1,\u2026,z_n\u2208\u2102, subdiagonal entries 1, and superdiagonal entries \u22121. Write M=D+E\u2212F with D=diag(z_1,\u2026,z_n), E the subdiagonal shift, and F the superdiagonal shift.\\n\\nLemma 1 (trace of M^2). For 2\u2264i\u2264n\u22121, (M^2)_{ii}=z_i^2\u22122, and for i=1,n, (M^2)_{ii}=z_i^2\u22121. Consequently tr(M^2)=\u03a3_{i=1}^n z_i^2 \u2212 2(n\u22121).\\nProof. (M^2)_{ii} = \u03a3_k M_{ik} M_{ki}. Only k\u2208{i\u22121,i,i+1} contribute. The k=i term gives z_i^2. The off-diagonal contributions are M_{i,i+1}M_{i+1,i}=(\u22121)\u00b71=\u22121 and M_{i,i\u22121}M_{i\u22121,i}=1\u00b7(\u22121)=\u22121, with only one such term at the endpoints. Summing over i yields tr(M^2)=\u03a3 z_i^2 \u2212[2(n\u22122)+2]=\u03a3 z_i^2 \u2212 2(n\u22121).\\n\\nLemma 2 (trace of M^3). We have tr(M^3)=\u03a3_{i=1}^n z_i^3 \u2212 3(z_1+2z_2+\u22ef+2 z_{n\u22121}+z_n).\\nProof. Expand (D+E\u2212F)^3=(D+K)^3 with K:=E\u2212F, noting K has zero diagonal and K^T=\u2212K. In the trace, terms with a single K factor vanish since DK and KD have zero diagonal; tr(K^3)=0 as K is skew-symmetric (tr(A^T)=tr(A) and K^T=\u2212K imply tr(K^3)=\u2212tr(K^3)). The surviving terms are tr(D^3)+3 tr(D K^2). The diagonal of K^2 equals (\u22121, \u22122,\u2026, \u22122, \u22121), hence tr(D K^2)=\u2212[z_1+2(z_2+\u22ef+z_{n\u22121})+z_n], giving the claim.\\n\\nLemma 3 (endpoint entries). For all n\u22652,\\n(a) (M^{n\u22121})_{1n}=(\u22121)^{n\u22121} and (M^{n\u22121})_{n1}=1.\\n(b) (M^{n})_{1n}=(\u22121)^{n\u22121} \u03a3_{i=1}^n z_i.\\n(c) (M^{n+1})_{1n}=(\u22121)^{n\u22121}(h_2(z) \u2212 (n\u22121)), where h_2(z):=\u03a3_{1\u2264i\u2264j\u2264n} z_i z_j.\\nProof. Interpret (M^k)_{ij} as a weighted sum over length-k paths on {1,\u2026,n} from i to j where a stay at r contributes z_r, an up-step (r\u2192r+1) contributes \u22121, and a down-step (r\u2192r\u22121) contributes +1. To go from 1 to n, the net up minus down equals n\u22121.\\n(a) For k=n\u22121, there is a unique path: n\u22121 up-steps, weight (\u22121)^{n\u22121}. Reversing direction gives (M^{n\u22121})_{n1}=1.\\n(b) For k=n, we must have exactly one stay and no down-steps; the stay can be at any vertex i, producing z_i with the same (\u22121)^{n\u22121} from the up-steps. Summing i gives the formula.\\n(c) For k=n+1, either (i) two stays and no down-step, which yields the weight (\u22121)^{n\u22121}h_2(z), or (ii) one down-step and no stays, which can be inserted at any of the n\u22121 edges of the monotone path, contributing (n\u22121)(\u22121)^n. Summing gives (\u22121)^{n\u22121}(h_2\u2212(n\u22121)).\\n\\nCorollary 4 (necessary conditions for nilpotency). If M is nilpotent, then tr(M)=0, tr(M^2)=0, tr(M^3)=0, and (M^{n+1})_{1n}=0. Equivalently,\\n- \u03a3 z_i=0,\\n- \u03a3 z_i^2=2(n\u22121),\\n- \u03a3 z_i^3=3(z_1+2z_2+\u22ef+2 z_{n\u22121}+z_n),\\n- h_2(z)=n\u22121 (the last is redundant given \u03a3 z_i=0 and \u03a3 z_i^2=2(n\u22121), since h_2=(\u03a3 z_i^2+(\u03a3 z_i)^2)/2).\\n\\nProposition 5 (no nilpotent for n=2,3 under \u03a3 i z_i=0).\\n(a) n=2. Nilpotency forces z_1+z_2=0 and z_1 z_2+1=0, so z_1=\u2212z_2 and z_2^2=\u22121. The linear constraint z_1+2z_2=0 implies z_2=0, a contradiction.\\n(b) n=3. Nilpotency forces \u03a3 z_i=0, \u03a3 z_i^2=4, and \u03a3 z_i^3=3(z_1+2z_2+z_3). Together with z_1+2z_2+3z_3=0 (and \u03a3 z_i=0 \u21d2 2z_1+z_2=0) one finds by elimination that these relations are inconsistent (e.g., solving 2z_1+z_2=0 and \u03a3 z_i=0 gives z_3=z_1; substituting into the cubic and quadratic constraints yields incompatible values). Hence no nilpotent M of the prescribed form exists for n=3.\\n\\nThese lemmas will be used as fixed constraints for the general case.\"},\"output_update\":null}",
