We verified key structural identities: [H,M]=E+F; explicit tr(M^2)=Σ z_i^2−2(n−1); tr(M^3)=Σ z_i^3−3(z_1+2⋯+2+z_n); and endpoint path counts (M^{n−1})_{1n}=(−1)^{n−1}, (M^n)_{1n}=(−1)^{n−1}Σ z_i, (M^{n+1})_{1n}=(−1)^{n−1}(h_2−(n−1)). These resolve n=2,3. The general case likely hinges on two pending pieces: (i) an exact formula for the sum of 3×3 principal minors S_3, plausibly Σ_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k+(n−3)Σ z_i+(z_1+z_n); and (ii) a full path formula for (M^{n+2})_{1n}, expected (−1)^{n−1}(h_3−3φ(z)) with φ(z)=z_1+2⋯+2+z_n. Proving these and combining with nilpotency constraints should produce a boundary linear contradiction with Σ i z_i=0.
