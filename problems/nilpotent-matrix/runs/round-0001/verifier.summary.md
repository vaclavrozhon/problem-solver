We validated the continuant recurrence and derived correct formulas for a_{n,1}, a_{n,2}, a_{n,3}, as well as tr(M^2), tr(M^3). Using α_{n+2}=0 under nilpotency gives E_3=0 and hence z_1+z_n=0. We computed and added rigorous formulas for a_{n,4} and tr(M^4): a_{n,4} contains no ∑ k z_k term (contrary to Prover 1’s claim) and is not independent of low-order traces by Newton’s identities. We also corrected a factor-3 slip in Prover 1’s α_{n+2} check and flagged Prover 2’s cofactor propagation as invalid and c_{n−4} sign/counting as suspect. Main obstacle: no current identity truly leverages the weighted constraint ∑ k z_k = 0. Next steps: derive J-based trace identities (e.g., tr(J M^r)) or a kernel-vector/Green’s identity approach that uses ∑ k z_k = 0; Prover 2 to deliver a correct c_{n−4} formula.
