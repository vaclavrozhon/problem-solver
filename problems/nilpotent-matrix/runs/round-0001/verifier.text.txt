{"feedback_md":"Overall: Good structural groundwork (commutators, similarity flow, path-counting, low-degree trace identities), and n=2,3 are convincingly ruled out. However, a general contradiction for arbitrary n is not yet established. The key missing piece is an identity that couples the fixed linear constraint Σ i z_i = 0 with the rigid, z-independent “corner” behavior of powers (or with characteristic-polynomial coefficients) strongly enough to force a contradiction.\n\nAudit highlights and corrections\n- P1: Lemmas 1–6 are correct and useful. Cor. 6.1 actually holds without assuming nilpotency (it follows from [H,M]M^{n−2} identity and Lemma 5); it becomes informative only when combined with evaluated entries of M^{n−2}. The claimed linear weights for c_{n,3} (“w_1=w_2=w_{n−1}=w_n=n−2, interior n−1”) appear incorrect: for n=4, the sum of 3×3 principal minors has linear part 2z_1+z_2+z_3+2z_4, not all 2’s. See P2 remark below.\n- P2: Path counts for (M^{n−1})_{1n} and (M^n)_{1n} are correct. The M^2/M^3 trace formulas are correct (tr(M^3)=Σ z_i^3−3(z_1+2⋯+2+z_n)); using Σ z_i=0 gives tr(M^3)=Σ z_i^3+3(z_1+z_n). Your proposed formula for the sum of 3×3 principal minors S_3 is plausible and matches n=3 and n=4 checks: S_3 = Σ_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k + (n−3) Σ z_i + (z_1+z_n). This needs a clean, general proof.\n- P3: The expansion tr(M^3)=Σ z_i^3−3(z_1+2⋯+2+z_n) is neatly derived; the endpoint formula (M^{n+1})_{1n}=(−1)^{n−1}(h_2−(n−1)) is correct. The conjectured (M^{n+2})_{1n} linear term proportional to φ(z)=z_1+2z_2+⋯+2z_{n−1}+z_n is consistent with combinatorics; please formalize it fully and determine the exact coefficient (expected −3).\n\nTriage and next steps\n- Prove S_3 exactly: sum all 3×3 principal minors and show S_3 = Σ_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k + (n−3)Σ z_i + (z_1+z_n). Then, using nilpotency (e_3=S_3=0) and Σ z_i=0, get Σ_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k = −(z_1+z_n).\n- Compute (M^{n+2})_{1n} exactly via paths. Target: (−1)^{n−1}(h_3 − 3φ(z)), where φ(z)=z_1+2z_2+⋯+2z_{n−1}+z_n. Nilpotency forces this to vanish. Combine with tr(M^3)=0 (which gives Σ z_i^3=3φ(z)) and the e_3=0 relation to eliminate cubic terms and isolate a boundary linear form contradicting Σ i z_i=0.\n- As a sanity check, carry out the full elimination for n=4 using: Σ z_i=0, Σ z_i^2=2(n−1), tr(M^3)=0, S_3=0, and (M^{n+2})_{1n}=0. If inconsistent, abstract the mechanism for general n.\n\nPlease avoid relying on sketchy c_{n,3} weights; instead provide a complete proof of S_3 and the k=n+2 endpoint identity.

For n=4, a direct computation shows the sum of all 3×3 principal minors equals Σ_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k + (2 z_1 + z_2 + z_3 + 2 z_4). This matches the general ansatz S_3 = Σ_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k + (n−3) Σ z_i + (z_1+z_n) (which reduces for n=4 to 2z_1+z_2+z_3+2z_4).

Let n≥2. Let M be the n×n tridiagonal matrix with diagonal entries z_1,…,z_n∈ℂ, subdiagonal entries 1, and superdiagonal entries −1. Write M=D+E−F with D=diag(z_1,…,z_n), E the subdiagonal shift, and F the superdiagonal shift.\n\nLemma 1 (trace of M^2). For 2≤i≤n−1, (M^2)_{ii}=z_i^2−2, and for i=1,n, (M^2)_{ii}=z_i^2−1. Consequently tr(M^2)=Σ_{i=1}^n z_i^2 − 2(n−1).\nProof. (M^2)_{ii} = Σ_k M_{ik} M_{ki}. Only k∈{i−1,i,i+1} contribute. The k=i term gives z_i^2. The off-diagonal contributions are M_{i,i+1}M_{i+1,i}=(−1)·1=−1 and M_{i,i−1}M_{i−1,i}=1·(−1)=−1, with only one such term at the endpoints. Summing over i yields tr(M^2)=Σ z_i^2 −[2(n−2)+2]=Σ z_i^2 − 2(n−1).\n\nLemma 2 (trace of M^3). We have tr(M^3)=Σ_{i=1}^n z_i^3 − 3(z_1+2z_2+⋯+2 z_{n−1}+z_n).\nProof. Expand (D+E−F)^3=(D+K)^3 with K:=E−F, noting K has zero diagonal and K^T=−K. In the trace, terms with a single K factor vanish since DK and KD have zero diagonal; tr(K^3)=0 as K is skew-symmetric (tr(A^T)=tr(A) and K^T=−K imply tr(K^3)=−tr(K^3)). The surviving terms are tr(D^3)+3 tr(D K^2). The diagonal of K^2 equals (−1, −2,…, −2, −1), hence tr(D K^2)=−[z_1+2(z_2+⋯+z_{n−1})+z_n], giving the claim.\n\nLemma 3 (endpoint entries).

Interpret (M^k)_{ij} as a weighted sum over length-k paths on {1,…,n} from i to j where a stay at r contributes z_r, an up-step (r→r+1) contributes −1, and a down-step (r→r−1) contributes +1. To go from 1 to n, the net up minus down equals n−1.\n(a) For k=n−1, there is a unique path: n−1 up-steps, weight (−1)^{n−1}. Reversing direction gives (M^{n−1})_{n1}=1.\n(b) For k=n, we must have exactly one stay and no down-steps; the stay can be at any vertex i, producing z_i with the same (−1)^{n−1} from the up-steps. Summing i gives the formula.\n(c) For k=n+1, either (i) two stays and no down-step, which yields the weight (−1)^{n−1}h_2(z), or (ii) one down-step and no stays, which can be inserted at any of the n−1 edges of the monotone path, contributing (n−1)(−1)^n. Summing gives (−1)^{n−1}(h_2−(n−1)).\n\nCorollary 4 (necessary conditions for nilpotency). If M is nilpotent, then tr(M)=0, tr(M^2)=0, tr(M^3)=0, and (M^{n+1})_{1n}=0.

Nilpotency forces z_1+z_2=0 and z_1 z_2+1=0, so z_1=−z_2 and z_2^2=−1. The linear constraint z_1+2z_2=0 implies z_2=0, a contradiction.\n(b) n=3. Nilpotency forces Σ z_i=0, Σ z_i^2=4, and Σ z_i^3=3(z_1+2z_2+z_3). Together with z_1+2z_2+3z_3=0 (and Σ z_i=0 ⇒ 2z_1+z_2=0) one finds by elimination that these relations are inconsistent (e.g., solving 2z_1+z_2=0 and Σ z_i=0 gives z_3=z_1; substituting into the cubic and quadratic constraints yields incompatible values).
