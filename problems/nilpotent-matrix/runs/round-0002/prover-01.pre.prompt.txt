Let M be a tridiagonal matrix with complex numbers z_1, z_2, ..., z_n on diagonal, all entries right below the main diagonal are 1 and all entries right above are -1, e.g.

z_1 -1   0
1    z_2 -1
0   1       z_3

Furthermore, the numbers on diagonal satisfy linear condition
z_1 + 2 z_2 + 3z_3 + ... n z_n =0.

# Tridiagonal nilpotency problem: structural identities and plan

Let M be the n×n tridiagonal matrix with diagonal Z = diag(z_1,…,z_n), ones on the subdiagonal (J), and −1 on the superdiagonal (−U). Thus M = Z + J − U. Define D = diag(1,2,…,n). Then
- [D,J] = J,
- [D,U] = −U,
- e^{−tD} M e^{tD} = Z + e^{−t} J − e^{t} U.
These are useful for similarity-invariant reasoning and path counting.

Basic trace identities (valid for all such M):
- trace(M) = ∑_{i=1}^n z_i.
- trace(M^2) = ∑_{i=1}^n z_i^2 − 2(n−1).
- trace(M^3) = ∑_{i=1}^n z_i^3 − 3(2∑_{i=1}^n z_i − (z_1 + z_n)).
If M were nilpotent, then trace(M^k) = 0 for k ≥ 1, hence ∑ z_i = 0 and ∑ z_i^2 = 2(n−1), etc.

Path-sum identities for the (n,1)-entry of powers (counting words in {J,Z,−U} that map e_1 → e_n while respecting boundaries):
- For k = n: (M^n)_{n,1} = ∑_{i=1}^n z_i. Reason: the only admissible words are those with exactly n−1 copies of J and one Z; the Z can occur at any intermediate index i.
- For k = n+1: (M^{n+1})_{n,1} = ∑_{1≤i≤j≤n} z_i z_j − (n−1). Reason: admissible words have either two Z’s and n−1 J’s (contributing ∑_{i≤j} z_i z_j) or one U and n J’s (there are exactly n−1 valid placements of the U; each contributes −1).
Under ∑ i z_i = 0, the identities for k = n and k = n+1 are compatible with trace(M) = 0 and trace(M^2) = 0 (since c_{n,2} = (n−1) + ∑_{i<j} z_i z_j = 0 is equivalent to ∑ z_i^2 = 2(n−1) when ∑ z_i = 0).

Outlook: To force a contradiction from the extra linear constraint ∑ i z_i = 0, we likely need the next identity (k = n+2). Admissible words now have either three Z’s and n−1 J’s, or one Z, one U, and n J’s. We expect a formula of the form
(M^{n+2})_{n,1} = e_3(z_1,…,z_n) − C_n · (∑_{i=1}^n i z_i),
for some explicit combinatorial constant C_n, obtained by counting valid placements of the single U relative to the single Z along the J-chain. If true, under ∑ i z_i = 0 and nilpotency ((M^{n+2})_{n,1} = 0) we get e_3(z) = 0. In tandem with trace(M^3) = 0 (which reads ∑ z_i^3 + 3(z_1 + z_n) = 0 when ∑ z_i = 0), this yields additional boundary constraints (e.g., z_1 + z_n = 0). Iterating to k = n+3 should overdetermine the system and show nonexistence for n ≥ 2.

Additional identities to verify/extend:
- A convenient constant identity: l^T M u = ∑_{i=1}^n i z_i − (n−1), where l = (1,…,1)^T and u = (1,2,…,n)^T.
- Higher traces: derive exact trace(M^4) (including boundary corrections) using A := J − U. One finds A^2 has diagonal entries −1 at i=1,n and −2 for 2≤i≤n−1, and trace(A^4) counts length-4 closed paths; preliminary count suggests trace(A^4) = 6n − 10 for n ≥ 3 (check carefully for small n and boundary cases). Then trace(M^4) = ∑ z_i^4 + 6∑ z_i^2 (A^2)_{ii} + trace(A^4).

Next steps for provers:
1) Prove rigorously the k = n+2 identity for (M^{n+2})_{n,1} and extract the coefficient of ∑ i z_i.
2) Establish trace(M^4) and c_{n,4} via Faddeev–LeVerrier; compare against the k = n+2 entry identity.
3) Use these to derive an explicit contradiction under ∑ i z_i = 0 and nilpotency.

Remark: The case n = 1 is a trivial nilpotent (z_1 = 0); the statement to be proved should assume n ≥ 2.


Setup and notation
- M = D + L − U with D = diag(z_1,…,z_n), L the lower shift (ones on the subdiagonal), U the upper shift (ones on the superdiagonal).
- W = diag(1,2,…,n). Define J := L + U and S := L − U.

Key identities we will use
- Commutators: [W, M] = L + U; [L, M] = [L, D] + E_{1,1} − E_{n,n}, where [L,D] has entries ([L,D])_{i+1,i} = z_i − z_{i+1}.
- Boundary entries of powers (1 ≤ k ≤ n):
  • (M^k)_{k,1} = ∑_{j=1}^k z_j; and for 0 ≤ k ≤ n−1, (M^k)_{k+1,1} = 1.
  • (M^k)_{n−k+1,n} = (−1)^{k−1} ∑_{j=n−k+1}^n z_j.
- Weighted sum relations:
  • ∑_{i=1}^n i z_i = ∑_{k=1}^n T_k with T_k = ∑_{j=n−k+1}^n z_j = (−1)^{k−1} (M^k)_{n−k+1,n}.
  • ∑_{k=1}^n S_k with S_k = ∑_{j=1}^k z_j equals (n+1)∑ z_i − ∑ i z_i. Hence if tr(M)=∑ z_i=0 (e.g., under nilpotency), then ∑_{k=1}^n S_k = −∑ i z_i = −∑_{k=1}^n (−1)^{k−1} (M^k)_{n−k+1,n}.
- Trace constraints: tr(M^2) = ∑ z_i^2 − 2(n−1); tr(M^3) = ∑ z_i^3 + 3(z_1 + z_n). Under nilpotency these vanish, giving ∑ z_i^2 = 2(n−1), ∑ z_i^3 = −3(z_1 + z_n).
- Additional continuant/coefficients facts (to be formalized): the λ^{n−3} coefficient identity implies e_3 = −(z_1 + z_n) when e_1=0; this matches tr(M^3).

Checked case and corrections
- n = 3: a direct coefficient analysis shows the weighted constraint is incompatible with nilpotency (see proofs.md for a complete argument).
- Correction: the equality ∑ i z_i = ∑_{k=1}^n S_k is false in general; it holds up to a sign only when ∑ z_i = 0. The right-edge identity ∑ i z_i = ∑_{k=1}^n T_k is exact.
- The claim that all principal cofactors C_{ii}(0) vanish under Δ_n(λ)=λ^n is false; do not use Δ_{i−1}(0) Δ^{(i+1)}_{n−i}(0) = 0.

Next steps
- Compute tr(M^4) and optionally tr(M^5) explicitly; combine with the commutator identities 0 = tr([L,M] M^{k−1}) for k=1,… to obtain additional independent constraints.
- Derive the λ^{n−4} coefficient in closed form via matchings and combine with e_1=0, e_2=−(n−1), e_3=−(z_1+z_n) and ∑ i z_i=0.
- Prototype an edge-peeling induction (e.g., eliminate z_1, z_n via the two linear equations and analyze a reduced tridiagonal system) and test it for n=4,5.


Added progress and corrections summary.

- We verified the continuant recurrence for P_k(λ) = det(λ I − M_{[k]}): P_k = (λ − z_k) P_{k−1} + P_{k−2}, with P_0 = 1, P_1 = λ − z_1. From this we confirmed:
  • a_{k,1} = −∑_{j ≤ k} z_j.
  • a_{k,2} = ∑_{1≤i<j≤k} z_i z_j + (k − 1).
  • a_{k,3} = −∑_{1≤i<j<ℓ≤k} z_i z_j z_ℓ − (k − 3)∑_{j ≤ k} z_j − (z_1 + z_k).
- Low-order traces: tr(M^2) = ∑ z_i^2 − 2(n − 1), tr(M^3) = ∑ z_i^3 − 6∑ z_i + 3(z_1 + z_n).
- Under nilpotency (M^n = 0): a_{n,1} = a_{n,2} = a_{n,3} = 0 ⇒ ∑ z_i = 0, ∑_{i<j} z_i z_j = −(n − 1), ∑_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k = −(z_1 + z_n). Also tr(M^2) = tr(M^3) = 0. Using α_{n+2} (see below) in fact enforces z_1 + z_n = 0 and hence E_3 = 0.
- Path counting (boundary-to-boundary entries): α_{n−1} = 1, α_n = ∑ z_i, α_{n+1} = ∑_{i≤j} z_i z_j − (n − 1), α_{n+2} = ∑_{i≤j≤k} z_i z_j z_k − (n − 1)∑ z_i. With S = ∑ z_i = 0, α_{n+2} = h_3 = (2/3)∑ z_i^3 − E_3. Since tr(M^3) = 0 gives ∑ z_i^3 + 3E_3 = 0, we get α_{n+2} = −3E_3. Nilpotency implies α_{n+2} = 0 ⇒ E_3 = 0 ⇒ z_1 + z_n = 0. (This corrects a factor-3 slip in an earlier note.)
- New explicit formulas:
  • Fourth coefficient: a_{n,4} = E_4 + (n − 5) E_2 + [∑_{j=1}^{n−1} z_j z_{j+1}] − (z_1^2 + z_n^2) + (n − 3)(n − 2)/2. In particular, there is no ∑ k z_k term.
  • tr(M^4) = ∑ z_i^4 − 8∑ z_i^2 + 4(z_1^2 + z_n^2) − 4∑_{j=1}^{n−1} z_j z_{j+1} + (6n − 10).
  Under nilpotency, tr(M^2) = tr(M^4) = 0.
- Observation: Newton identities show a_{n,4} is determined by tr(M^2), tr(M^4). Thus a_{n,4} = 0 brings no new constraint beyond tr(M^2) = tr(M^4) = 0 when M is nilpotent.
- Critical gap: None of the current identities truly use the weighted constraint ∑ k z_k = 0. Coefficients/traces and α_{n+q} depend on symmetric sums and boundary effects (z_1, z_n) and adjacent products, but we do not see an index-weighted linear term emerge. We need identities explicitly involving J = diag(1,2,…,n). Candidates: tr(J M^r) expansions, and a kernel-vector approach for M v = 0 combined with discrete summation by parts and ∑ k z_k = 0.

# Main Results




=== Round 1 Summary ===

Last round verified the continuant recurrence and boundary path-count identities and produced closed forms for low-order coefficients and traces. Explicit formulas were obtained for a_{n,1..4} and for tr(M^2), tr(M^3), tr(M^4) (with corrected factors and boundary terms). Using the boundary entry α_{n+2} together with nilpotency gave E_3=0 and hence z_1+z_n=0. The n=3 case under the weighted constraint z_1+2z_2+3z_3=0 was ruled out. It was shown a_{n,4} contains no weighted term ∑ i z_i, so Newton identities make a_{n,4}=0 dependent on tr(M^2)=tr(M^4)=0 and not independently useful. Main remaining gap: no current identity truly uses the weighted constraint ∑ i z_i=0. Next work should target W:=diag(1..n)-based trace identities or a kernel/Green approach to exploit the weighted sum and complete an induction.

=== Previous Round Feedback ===

Overall: both provers established several correct, reusable identities (characteristic polynomial recurrence, first few coefficients, and low-order trace relations). However, neither prover produced a contradiction using the weighted constraint ∑ k z_k = 0. There are also some inaccuracies that must be corrected before proceeding.

Key correctness checks and fixes:
- Prover 1: Lemma 1 (coefficients a_{k,1}, a_{k,2}, a_{k,3}) is correct; the tridiagonal determinant recurrence P_k = (λ − z_k) P_{k−1} + P_{k−2} is valid for this band pattern. Lemma 3 (traces tr(M^2), tr(M^3)) is also correct, with diag(N^2) = (−1, −2, …, −2, −1). The path-counting for α_{n−1}, α_n, α_{n+1}, α_{n+2} is fine in spirit. However, in the “consistency check” you miscomputed a factor: with S = 0, α_{n+2} = (2/3)∑ z_j^3 − E_3 and ∑ z_j^3 + 3E_3 = 0 imply α_{n+2} = −3E_3 (not −E_3). Since nilpotency forces M^n = 0, we do have α_{n+2} = 0, hence E_3 = 0 and thus z_1 + z_n = 0; the final conclusion remains correct, but the displayed intermediate equality is off by a factor 3.
- Crucially, the strategic claim that a weighted term C·∑ k z_k appears in a_{n,4} is false. We computed a closed form for a_{n,4} and found no ∑ k z_k term (see proofs update). Moreover, by Newton’s identities c_4 is an explicit combination of tr(M^2), tr(M^4); under nilpotency both vanish, so a_{n,4} = 0 carries no new information beyond tr(M^2)=tr(M^4)=0.
- Prover 2: The λ^{n−3} coefficient identity via matchings is correct and matches Prover 1. The Wronskian-type identity T_n(0)=0 yielding 1 − α_1^2 + α_2^2 − ⋯ + (−1)^{n−1} α_{n−1}^2 = 0 is correct and useful. However, the cofactor-vanishing claim is wrong: Δ_n'(0) = 0 only implies the sum of diagonal cofactors vanishes, not that each cofactor (or its two continuant factors) vanishes. Also, your suggested formula c_{n−4} = e_4 − Q + m_2 has a sign issue: contributions from one-edge matchings to λ^{n−4} enter with a positive sign (not negative). The reduction Q = (n−4) e_2 + ∑ z_i z_{i+1} is not justified and appears incorrect.

What is solid now:
- Verified coefficient identities a_{n,1}, a_{n,2}, a_{n,3}, and the consequences under nilpotency: S=0, E_2=−(n−1), E_3=−(z_1+z_n), and in fact E_3=0 ⇒ z_1+z_n=0 by using α_{n+2}=0.
- Verified low-order trace identities tr(M^2), tr(M^3); and we add tr(M^4) explicitly in proofs.
- New: a precise, closed formula for a_{n,4} (no ∑ k z_k term), and tr(M^4) (a concrete identity in z’s and adjacent products).

Blocking conceptual issue: None of the identities derived so far meaningfully leverage the weighted constraint ∑ k z_k = 0. Pursuing higher coefficients/α-entries alone will not introduce that weight naturally; those expressions depend on symmetric sums and boundary terms (z_1, z_n, adjacent products), not on the index-weighted linear functional.

Concrete next steps:
1) Abandon the expectation that a_{n,4} yields a ∑ k z_k term. Instead, derive and exploit identities that explicitly involve J = diag(1,…,n). Promising directions:
   - Compute tr(J M^r) for small r (especially r = 1,2,3) in terms of z’s and constants (we provide tr(J M^2) structure in notes). Try to combine tr(J M^r) with nilpotency constraints tr(M^s)=0 and commutator relations [J, M] = U to force linear relations such as ∑ k z_k = 0 ⇒ incompatible with other identities.
   - Use kernel-vector approach: if M is nilpotent, there exists 0 ≠ v with M v = 0. The recurrence v_{i+1} = z_i v_i + v_{i−1} (Dirichlet boundaries v_0 = v_{n+1} = 0) combined with ∑ i z_i = 0 might yield an obstruction via discrete integration by parts, e.g., pairing with the sequence i and summing.
2) Prover 2: Provide a correct, fully derived formula for c_{n−4} via matchings (with correct signs and explicit, verifiable combinatorics). Check whether boundary-sensitive terms (z_1, z_n) and nearest-neighbor sums emerge, and test if they can be combined with tr(J M) = 0.
3) Explore a general closed form for α_{n+q} as a combination of complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials h_{q−2s} with coefficients equal to counts of s-edge matchings on P_{n−1}. This will clarify systematically that index-weighted sums do not appear in α_{n+q}, steering efforts toward J-based trace/variational methods.

Until a mechanism that truly uses ∑ k z_k = 0 is found, a full contradiction seems out of reach.
