Adding the two contributions yields the linear coefficient of z_k equal to n\u22122 for k\u2208{1,n} and n\u22123 for 2\u2264k\u2264n\u22121. Hence the linear part is (n\u22123)\u2211_i z_i + (z_1+z_n).\\n\u220e\\n\\nCorollary 1.1 (cubic-vs-linear under \u03a3 z_i=0)\\nIf \u2211 z_i=0 then S_3 = \u2211_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k + (z_1+z_n).\\n\\nLemma 2 ((M^{n+2})_{1n} exact formula)\\nLet h_3(z) := \u2211_{1\u2264i\u2264j\u2264k\u2264n} z_i z_j z_k (complete homogeneous symmetric polynomial of degree 3) and L_n(z) := (n+1) \u2211_{i=1}^n z_i \u2212 (z_1+z_n). Then\\n(M^{n+2})_{1n} = (\u22121)^{n\u22121} ( h_3(z) \u2212 L_n(z) ).\\nProof. Interpret (M^p)_{1n} as the sum over length-p walks on {1,\u2026,n} from n to 1 with allowed steps: \u201cdown\u201d j\u2192j\u22121 (weight \u22121), \u201cup\u201d j\u2192j+1 (weight +1), and \u201cstay\u201d j\u2192j (weight z_j). To reach 1 from n in n+2 steps, beyond the n\u22121 minimal down-steps, there are exactly two combinatorial types of extra operations: (i) three stays; (ii) one up\u2013down pair (returning to the same level) and one stay. Case (i) contributes (\u22121)^{n\u22121} h_3(z) (choose a multiset of three stay-levels along the monotone path). Case (ii) contributes linearly in z. For fixed k, count decorated paths with the unique stay at level k and the up\u2013down pair anchored at some j\u2208{1,\u2026,n\u22121}:\\n- For j\u2264k\u22122: the stay occurs before the pair (1 way for each j).\\n- For j=k\u22121: two possibilities (stay before the pair, or between the up and down steps at level k=j+1).\\n- For j=k: two possibilities (stay before the up, or after the down, both at level k).\\n- For j\u2265k+1: the stay occurs after the pair (1 way for each j).\\nSumming yields the count c_k of such decorations: c_1=c_n=n and c_k=n+1 for 2\u2264k\u2264n\u22121. Each such path has weight (\u22121)^{n} z_k (one extra down contributes an extra \u22121), hence the total contribution of case (ii) is (\u22121)^{n} \u2211_k c_k z_k = (\u22121)^{n\u22121} [ (n+1)\u2211_i z_i \u2212 (z_1+z_n) ] = (\u22121)^{n\u22121} L_n(z). Combining (i) and (ii) proves the formula.\\n\u220e\\n\\nRemarks on Lemma 2\\n- Under \u2211 z_i=0, L_n(z) simplifies to \u2212(z_1+z_n).\\n- Using Newton\u2019s identities, h_3 equals (p_1^3 \u2212 2 p_1 p_2 + p_3)/3 in terms of power sums p_m=\u2211 z_i^m; hence if \u2211 z_i=0 and tr(M^3)=p_3\u22123\u03c6(z)=0 with \u03c6=z_1+2z_2+\u22ef+2 z_{n\u22121}+z_n, then h_3 = p_3/3 = \u03c6. Thus Lemma 2 becomes (M^{n+2})_{1n}=(\u22121)^{n\u22121}(\u03c6+z_1+z_n) when \u2211 z_i=0; this vanishes identically once \u03c6=\u2212(z_1+z_n), so Lemma 2 brings no new constraint beyond tr(M^3)=0 and \u2211 z_i=0.\\n\\nConsequences for nilpotent M\\nIf M is nilpotent then det(\u03bbI\u2212M)=\u03bb^n, hence the principal symmetric sums vanish: e_1=\u2211 z_i=0, e_2=\u2211_{i<j} z_i z_j + (n\u22121)=0 (equivalently \u2211 z_i^2=2(n\u22121)), and e_3=S_3=0. From Lemma 1 and \u2211 z_i=0, e_3=0 implies \u2211_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k = \u2212(z_1+z_n). Newton\u2019s identities also give h_3 = e_1^3 \u2212 2 e_1 e_2 + e_3; with e_1=0 this yields h_3=e_3=0, hence \u03c6=0 as noted above.\\n\\nWorked case n=4 (complete contradiction)\\nAssume M is 4\u00d74 nilpotent and \u2211 i z_i=0. Then e_1=0, e_2=0, e_3=0. From e_2=0 we get \u2211 z_i^2=6. From e_3=0 and Lemma 1 (with n=4) we get z_1 z_2 z_3 + z_1 z_2 z_4 + z_1 z_3 z_4 + z_2 z_3 z_4 + (2 z_1 + z_2 + z_3 + 2 z_4)=0. As observed, e_3=0 and e_1=0 force \u03c6=0, i.e. z_1+2 z_2+2 z_3+z_4=0. Together with \u2211 i z_i= z_1+2 z_2+3 z_3+4 z_4=0 and \u2211 z_i=0 one solves\\n(z_1,z_2,z_3,z_4) = (\u2212t, 3t, \u22123t, t)\\nfor some t\u2208C, hence \u2211 z_i^2 = 20 t^2 = 6 \u21d2 t^2 = 3/10. The determinant det M equals the continuant p_4 generated by p_0=1, p_1=z_1, p_2=z_2 z_1+1, p_3=z_3 p_2+p_1, p_4=z_4 p_3+p_2. Substituting the above parametrization yields\\np_4 = 9 t^4 \u2212 7 t^2 + 1 = 9\u00b7(3/10)^2 \u2212 7\u00b7(3/10) + 1 = \u221229/100 \u2260 0.\\nThus det M \u2260 0, contradicting nilpotency. Hence no nilpotent M exists for n=4 under the weighted constraint.\\n\\nObstacles\\n- Lemma 2 shows (M^{n+2})_{1n}=0 brings no new constraint once e_1=e_2=e_3=0 are imposed; it reduces to \u03c6=0, already implied by e_3=0 and e_1=0.\\n- Extending the n=4 elimination to general n likely needs the e_4 constraint (sum of 4\u00d74 principal minors) or a precise determinant formula under the linear constraints. A uniform closed form for S_4 analogous to Lemma 1 (with cubic and linear boundary pieces) is plausible but requires careful combinatorics of 4\u00d74 blocks and adjacent pairs.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Prove a general S_4 formula: e_4 as the sum of 4\u00d74 principal minors decomposes into the pure quartic symmetric sum plus lower-degree boundary corrections; identify the linear part explicitly. Under e_1=e_2=e_3=0 and \u2211 i z_i=0, show e_4 \u2260 0.\\n- Alternatively, develop a continuant-based elimination: use p_k = z_k p_{k\u22121} + p_{k\u22122} across k with e_1=e_2=e_3 constraints to force a normalized pattern of z\u2019s (as in n=4), then compute p_n symbolically to show it cannot vanish.\\n- Cross-check small sizes n=5,6 computationally to conjecture the general boundary-linear coefficients for S_4 and guide the proof.\\n\\nSummary of progress\\n- Fully proved the S_3 identity for all n.\\n- Proved the corrected exact formula (M^{n+2})_{1n} = (\u22121)^{n\u22121}(h_3 \u2212 L_n) with L_n=(n+1)\u2211 z_i \u2212 (z_1+z_n); clarified its redundancy under e_1=e_2=e_3=0.\\n- Settled n=4 completely by contradiction using e_1=e_2=e_3=0, the weighted constraint, and the continuant for det M. The mechanism suggests using e_4 in general to close the argument for arbitrary n.\"}",
