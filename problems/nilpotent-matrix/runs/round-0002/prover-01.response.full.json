I point out concrete issues in the notes, supply fully rigorous lemmas (with proofs), and propose auditable next steps that directly involve the weight operator W = diag(1,\u2026,n).\\n\\n\\nCorrections and gaps to fix now\\n\\n- h\u2083 vs e\u2083 vs p\u2083 confusion: For variables z = (z\u2081,\u2026,z\u2099), one has h\u2083 = e\u2081\u00b3 \u2212 2e\u2081e\u2082 + e\u2083. In particular, if e\u2081 = \u2211 z\u1d62 = 0, then h\u2083 = e\u2083. The earlier claim \u201ch\u2083 = (2/3)\u2211 z\u1d62\u00b3 \u2212 E\u2083\u201d is incorrect. This must be corrected wherever used.\\n- \u03b1_{n+2} factor: The correct path-classification for \u03b1_{n+2} := (M^{n+2})_{n,1} gives \u03b1_{n+2} = h\u2083(z) \u2212 (n\u22121)\u2211 z\u1d62 (proof below). Under \u2211 z\u1d62=0, \u03b1_{n+2}=h\u2083=e\u2083. Thus \u03b1_{n+2}=0 forces e\u2083=0, and together with a_{n,3}=0 (which reads e\u2083 = \u2212(z\u2081+z\u2099) when e\u2081=0) one concludes z\u2081+z\u2099=0. The \u201c\u22123\u201d factor appearing in prior notes is erroneous.\\n- tr(M\u00b3): The general identity is tr(M\u00b3) = \u2211 z\u1d62\u00b3 \u2212 6\u2211 z\u1d62 + 3(z\u2081+z\u2099). The shortened form tr(M\u00b3)=\u2211 z\u1d62\u00b3 + 3(z\u2081+z\u2099) holds only when \u2211 z\u1d62=0. Please standardize statements accordingly.\\n- Weighted condition usage: So far, the weight \u2211 i z\u1d62 has only been repackaged (e.g., as tr(WM) or as sums of boundary entries), but not exploited to force a contradiction beyond what nilpotency already gives. We need identities where W enters essentially.\\n\\n\\nRigorous lemmas and proofs to add\\n\\nNotation: M = D + L \u2212 U with D = diag(z\u2081,\u2026,z\u2099), L the lower shift, U the upper shift. Let W = diag(1,\u2026,n).\\n\\n1) Commutator identities (for reference)\\n- [W, M] = L + U.\\n- [L, M] = [L, D] + E_{1,1} \u2212 E_{n,n}, with ([L, D])_{i+1,i} = z\u1d62 \u2212 z_{i+1}.\\nProofs are standard and already essentially present; keep them in proofs.md.\\n\\n2) Boundary entries of powers (left and right edges)\\n- For 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n: (M^k)_{k,1} = \u2211_{j=1}^k z_j and, for 0 \u2264 k \u2264 n\u22121, (M^k)_{k+1,1} = 1.\\n- For 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n: (M^k)_{n\u2212k+1,n} = (\u22121)^{k\u22121} \u2211_{j=n\u2212k+1}^n z_j.\\nProof (sketch). Enumerate paths on the chain graph from column 1 to row k (resp. n) in k steps using D,L,U moves. Minimal-length constraints force exactly one D and no U for the left edge case, and exactly one D and no L for the right edge; signs for U\u2019s are (\u22121) per U. Details as in prior round; formalize in proofs.md.\\n\\n3) Weighted-sum reformulations\\n- tr(WM) = \u2211 i z\u1d62 (since tr(WL)=tr(WU)=0). So the weighted constraint is exactly tr(WM) = 0.\\n- \u2211_{k=1}^n (M^k)_{k,1} = \u2211_{k=1}^n \u2211_{j=1}^k z_j = (n+1)\u2211 z\u1d62 \u2212 \u2211 i z\u1d62. Hence if \u2211 z\u1d62 = 0 (true for nilpotent M), the constraint \u2211 i z\u1d62 = 0 is equivalent to \u2211_{k=1}^n (M^k)_{k,1} = 0.\\n- Also \u2211 i z\u1d62 = \u2211_{k=1}^n T_k with T_k := \u2211_{j=n\u2212k+1}^n z_j = (\u22121)^{k\u22121}(M^k)_{n\u2212k+1,n} (exact, no need to assume \u2211 z\u1d62=0).\\nThese identities place the weighted constraint squarely into sums of specific boundary entries of powers.\\n\\n4) Exact formula for \u03b1_{n+2} with proof\\nLet \u03b1_m := (M^m)_{n,1}. For m = n+2 there are two path-types from 1 to n in m steps:\\n- Type A: d = 3 diagonal steps, u = 0 up-steps, \u2113 = n\u22121 down-steps; weight = product of the 3 diagonal z\u2019s; summing over all placements yields h\u2083(z).\\n- Type B: d = 1 diagonal, u = 1 up-step, \u2113 = n down-steps; weight = (\u22121)\u00b7z_i for the unique z_i chosen. The number of valid placements of the single U among the n L\u2019s, subject to the path staying within the chain constraints, is exactly n\u22121 (U cannot occur before the first L nor after the last L, otherwise the path exits the 1..n strip). Thus the total contribution is \u2212(n\u22121)\u2211 z\u1d62.\\nTherefore\\n\u03b1_{n+2} = h\u2083(z) \u2212 (n\u22121)\u2211 z\u1d62.\\nIn particular, if \u2211 z\u1d62 = 0, then \u03b1_{n+2} = h\u2083 = e\u2083.\\n\\n5) Consequence: z\u2081 + z\u2099 = 0 under nilpotency\\nIf M is nilpotent then \u03b1_{n+2} = 0 and \u2211 z\u1d62 = 0, hence e\u2083 = 0. On the other hand, the previously verified coefficient identity a_{n,3} = 0 reads (with e\u2081=0)\\n0 = a_{n,3} = \u2212e\u2083 \u2212 (z\u2081 + z\u2099).\\nThus e\u2083 = 0 implies z\u2081 + z\u2099 = 0. This step is sound and should replace the factor-3 argument in notes.\\n\\n6) A weighted trace identity for M\u00b2\\ntr(WM\u00b2) = \u2211_{i=1}^n i z_i^2 \u2212 (n\u00b2 \u2212 1).\\nProof. Expand M\u00b2 = D\u00b2 + (DL + LD) \u2212 (DU + UD) + (L\u00b2 + U\u00b2) \u2212 (LU + UL). Since L,U have zero diagonal, tr(WDL)=tr(WLD)=tr(WDU)=tr(WUD)=tr(WL\u00b2)=tr(WU\u00b2)=0. We have (LU)_{ii}=1 for 2\u2264i\u2264n and (UL)_{ii}=1 for 1\u2264i\u2264n\u22121. Hence tr(W LU) = \u2211_{i=2}^n i and tr(W UL) = \u2211_{i=1}^{n\u22121} i, so tr(W(LU+UL)) = n\u00b2 \u2212 1. The claim follows.\\nRemark. This shows tr(WM\u00b2) is completely explicit. While it doesn\u2019t by itself contradict nilpotency or \u2211 i z\u1d62 = 0, it is a reusable identity that couples W and the z\u2019s quadratically.\\n\\n7) Kernel summation-by-parts identity (weighted)\\nLet 0 \u2260 v \u2208 ker M with boundary v\u2080 = v_{n+1} = 0 and recurrence v_{i+1} = z_i v_i + v_{i\u22121}. Then\\n\u2211_{i=1}^n i z_i v_i^2 = \u2212 \u2211_{i=1}^{n\u22121} v_i v_{i+1}.\\nProof. Multiply v_{i+1} \u2212 z_i v_i \u2212 v_{i\u22121} = 0 by i v_i and sum i=1..n. The cross terms telescope to \u2212\u2211_{i=1}^{n\u22121} v_i v_{i+1} using v\u2080 = v_{n+1} = 0 as in the analysis. This identity is new in the notes and precisely exhibits how the weighted functional interacts with a kernel vector.\\nComments. On its own this does not contradict \u2211 i z\u1d62 = 0, but it is a promising bridge to combine with other constraints (e.g., \u2211 z_i v_i^2 = 0 from the unweighted pairing) and with explicit structure of v coming from the transfer recurrences.\\n\\n\\nWhere the current writeup needs tightening\\n\\n- Provide the full proof of item (4): \u03b1_{n+2} = h\u2083 \u2212 (n\u22121)\u2211 z\u1d62. The path classification is simple, but the admissibility count (n\u22121 for the single U) must be justified carefully (e.g., via a bijection between valid placements and the n\u22121 interior edges of the path graph).\\n- Unify all uses of tr(M\u00b3) under one general identity and then state the nilpotent corollary as a separate line; currently both forms appear and may confuse the reader.\\n- Explicitly record the equivalence \u2211 i z\u1d62 = 0 \u21d4 tr(WM)=0, and under \u2211 z\u1d62=0 the equivalent form \u2211_{k=1}^n (M^k)_{k,1} = 0. These translations matter when we try to craft weighted commutator arguments.\\n- Remove or correct the incorrect \u201ch\u2083 = (2/3)\u2211 z\u1d62\u00b3 \u2212 e\u2083\u201d and the \u201c\u03b1_{n+2} = \u22123 e\u2083\u201d claims. Replace them with the clean chain: \u03b1_{n+2}=h\u2083\u2212(n\u22121)\u2211 z\u1d62; with \u2211 z\u1d62=0 this is \u03b1_{n+2}=e\u2083; under nilpotency \u03b1_{n+2}=0 so e\u2083=0; then a_{n,3}=0 gives z\u2081+z\u2099=0.\\n\\n\\nIdeas to leverage the weighted constraint going forward\\n\\n- W-traces: We now have tr(WM)=0 (the weighted condition) and an explicit tr(WM\u00b2). It is feasible to compute tr(WM\u00b3) explicitly (though more involved since cyclicity doesn\u2019t neutralize W). These give concrete equations involving weighted power sums of z and short \u201cedge\u201d corrections. Combining tr(M^k)=0 and tr(WM^k) identities for k=1,2,3 may overdetermine z\u2081 and z\u2099 in terms of the interior, possibly enabling an induction.\\n- Kernel method: The two identities \u2211 z_i v_i^2 = 0 and \u2211 i z_i v_i^2 = \u2212\u2211 v_i v_{i+1}, together with the Riccati variables w_{i+1} = z_i + 1/w_i (from v_{i+1}/v_i = z_i + 1/w_i), give a closed system whose weighted sums can be tracked. With z\u2081+z\u2099=0 already forced by \u03b1_{n+2}, this method may yield a contradiction (e.g., by showing \u2211 i z_i v_i^2 \u2260 0 unless z \u2261 0, which is impossible by e\u2082 = \u2212(n\u22121)).\\n- Edge-peeling induction: With z\u2081+z\u2099=0, re-express e\u2082, e\u2083, and a_{n,4} in terms of the middle block z\u2082,\u2026,z_{n\u22121} and z\u2081. Investigate whether P_n(\u03bb) factors as \u03bb\u00b2P_{n\u22122}(\u03bb) plus a term that is incompatible with P_n(\u03bb)=\u03bb\u207f under the two linear relations e\u2081=0, \u2211 i z\u1d62=0. A block-determinant approach (eliminating the 1st and nth rows/columns) may show that nilpotency of M forces nilpotency of the middle (n\u22122)\u00d7(n\u22122) tridiagonal with an inherited weighted relation, enabling induction. This is precise and checkable.\\n\\n\\nObstacles (why some routes fail)\\n\\n- Coefficients and boundary entries \u03b1_{n+q} alone do not produce index-weighted terms; they depend on symmetric polynomials and small boundary corrections (z\u2081,z\u2099), not on \u2211 i z\u1d62. Hence pushing \u03b1_{n+q} without W will not incorporate the weighted constraint.\\n- Inequalities (e.g., positivity) are unavailable: z\u1d62 \u2208 \u2102, so Cauchy\u2013Schwarz-type obstructions for the weighted sums do not apply.\\n\\n\\nNext steps (auditable and targeted)\\n\\n1) Formalize and include in proofs.md the exact \u03b1_{n+2} identity with full combinatorial proof and a short note deducing z\u2081+z\u2099=0 from nilpotency.\\n2) Compute tr(WM\u00b3) explicitly. With tr(M)=0, tr(M\u00b2)=0, tr(M\u00b3)=0 and tr(WM)=0, tr(WM\u00b2) known, and tr(WM\u00b3) (to be computed), attempt to solve for z\u2081 and z\u2099 in terms of interior z\u2019s, then show incompatibility with e\u2082 = \u2212(n\u22121) and e\u2083 = 0.\\n3) Develop the block-determinant (Schur complement) reduction eliminating indices 1 and n. Make precise what weighted relation the (n\u22122) middle block inherits from \u2211 i z\u1d62=0 and e\u2081=0, and prove an induction step (if the middle block were nilpotent under its inherited constraint, then so would M be; contrapositive yields the desired impossibility).\\n4) Document the kernel weighted identity (item 7) and explore whether combining it with \u2211 z_i v_i^2 = 0 and z\u2081+z\u2099=0 already forces constraints on v (e.g., via a short computation for n=4,5) that contradict e\u2082=\u2212(n\u22121).\\n\\nThese items directly address the principal gap: bringing the weighted condition into identities that interact with nilpotency in a nontrivial way, while cleaning up the existing derivations for correctness and future reuse.\"}",
