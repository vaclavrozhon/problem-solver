Ideas

- Prove an exact formula for S_3, the sum of all 3×3 principal minors. This pins down the λ^{n−3} coefficient of the characteristic polynomial and is independent of any nilpotency assumption.
- Compute (M^{n+2})_{1n} exactly. Correct the earlier “−3 φ” guess: a careful path count shows a different linear form appears. Under Σ z_i = 0 and tr(M^3)=0, the identity becomes redundant, but its explicit form is useful for cross-checks.
- Use these identities to settle the case n=4 completely (contradiction), as a sanity check and a template for higher n.

Lemma 1 (S_3 formula)
Let M be the n×n tridiagonal M=D+E−F with D=diag(z_1,…,z_n), E_{i+1,i}=1, F_{i,i+1}=1. Let S_3 be the sum of all 3×3 principal minors of M. Then
S_3 = ∑_{1≤i<j<k≤n} z_i z_j z_k + (n−3) ∑_{i=1}^n z_i + (z_1+z_n).
Proof. A 3×3 principal submatrix is a disjoint union of consecutive blocks. For an index set of size 3 there are three types:
- Three isolated indices i<j<k: the determinant is z_i z_j z_k.
- Exactly one adjacent pair i,i+1 and an isolated index k: the determinant is (z_i z_{i+1}+1) z_k = z_i z_{i+1} z_k + z_k.
- Three consecutive indices i,i+1,i+2: the determinant is z_i z_{i+1} z_{i+2} + z_i + z_{i+2}.
Summing over all 3-sets S gives: cubic parts altogether equal ∑_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k (each triple monomial is counted exactly once, whether the triple contains adjacency or not). The linear parts collect as follows. From the “one adjacent pair” case, for each fixed k the index i can be any of 1,…,n−1 except k−2,k−1,k,k+1 when these lie in [1,n−1]; this yields coefficients n−3 for k∈{1,n}, n−4 for k∈{2,n−1}, and n−5 otherwise. From the “three consecutive” case, the sum ∑_{i=1}^{n−2} (z_i + z_{i+2}) adds 1 to the coefficients of k∈{1,2,n−1,n} and 2 to 3≤k≤n−2. Adding the two contributions yields the linear coefficient of z_k equal to n−2 for k∈{1,n} and n−3 for 2≤k≤n−1. Hence the linear part is (n−3)∑_i z_i + (z_1+z_n).

Corollary 1.1 (cubic-vs-linear under Σ z_i=0)
If ∑ z_i=0 then S_3 = ∑_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k + (z_1+z_n).

Lemma 2 ((M^{n+2})_{1n} exact formula)
Let h_3(z) := ∑_{1≤i≤j≤k≤n} z_i z_j z_k (complete homogeneous symmetric polynomial of degree 3) and L_n(z) := (n+1) ∑_{i=1}^n z_i − (z_1+z_n). Then
(M^{n+2})_{1n} = (−1)^{n−1} ( h_3(z) − L_n(z) ).
Proof. Interpret (M^p)_{1n} as the sum over length-p walks on {1,…,n} from n to 1 with allowed steps: “down” j→j−1 (weight −1), “up” j→j+1 (weight +1), and “stay” j→j (weight z_j). To reach 1 from n in n+2 steps, beyond the n−1 minimal down-steps, there are exactly two combinatorial types of extra operations: (i) three stays; (ii) one up–down pair (returning to the same level) and one stay. Case (i) contributes (−1)^{n−1} h_3(z) (choose a multiset of three stay-levels along the monotone path). Case (ii) contributes linearly in z. For fixed k, count decorated paths with the unique stay at level k and the up–down pair anchored at some j∈{1,…,n−1}:
- For j≤k−2: the stay occurs before the pair (1 way for each j).
- For j=k−1: two possibilities (stay before the pair, or between the up and down steps at level k=j+1).
- For j=k: two possibilities (stay before the up, or after the down, both at level k).
- For j≥k+1: the stay occurs after the pair (1 way for each j).
Summing yields the count c_k of such decorations: c_1=c_n=n and c_k=n+1 for 2≤k≤n−1. Each such path has weight (−1)^{n} z_k (one extra down contributes an extra −1), hence the total contribution of case (ii) is (−1)^{n} ∑_k c_k z_k = (−1)^{n−1} [ (n+1)∑_i z_i − (z_1+z_n) ] = (−1)^{n−1} L_n(z). Combining (i) and (ii) proves the formula.
∎

Remarks on Lemma 2
- Under ∑ z_i=0, L_n(z) simplifies to −(z_1+z_n).
- Using Newton’s identities, h_3 equals (p_1^3 − 2 p_1 p_2 + p_3)/3 in terms of power sums p_m=∑ z_i^m; hence if ∑ z_i=0 and tr(M^3)=p_3−3φ(z)=0 with φ=z_1+2z_2+⋯+2 z_{n−1}+z_n, then h_3 = p_3/3 = φ. Thus Lemma 2 becomes (M^{n+2})_{1n}=(−1)^{n−1}(φ+z_1+z_n) when ∑ z_i=0; this vanishes identically once φ=−(z_1+z_n), so Lemma 2 brings no new constraint beyond tr(M^3)=0 and ∑ z_i=0.

Consequences for nilpotent M
If M is nilpotent then det(λI−M)=λ^n, hence the principal symmetric sums vanish: e_1=∑ z_i=0, e_2=∑_{i<j} z_i z_j + (n−1)=0 (equivalently ∑ z_i^2=2(n−1)), and e_3=S_3=0. From Lemma 1 and ∑ z_i=0, e_3=0 implies ∑_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k = −(z_1+z_n). Newton’s identities also give h_3 = e_1^3 − 2 e_1 e_2 + e_3; with e_1=0 this yields h_3=e_3=0, hence φ=0 as noted above.

Worked case n=4 (complete contradiction)
Assume M is 4×4 nilpotent and ∑ i z_i=0. Then e_1=0, e_2=0, e_3=0. From e_2=0 we get ∑ z_i^2=6. From e_3=0 and Lemma 1 (with n=4) we get z_1 z_2 z_3 + z_1 z_2 z_4 + z_1 z_3 z_4 + z_2 z_3 z_4 + (2 z_1 + z_2 + z_3 + 2 z_4)=0. As observed, e_3=0 and e_1=0 force φ=0, i.e. z_1+2 z_2+2 z_3+z_4=0. Together with ∑ i z_i= z_1+2 z_2+3 z_3+4 z_4=0 and ∑ z_i=0 one solves
(z_1,z_2,z_3,z_4) = (−t, 3t, −3t, t)
for some t∈C, hence ∑ z_i^2 = 20 t^2 = 6 ⇒ t^2 = 3/10. The determinant det M equals the continuant p_4 generated by p_0=1, p_1=z_1, p_2=z_2 z_1+1, p_3=z_3 p_2+p_1, p_4=z_4 p_3+p_2. Substituting the above parametrization yields
p_4 = 9 t^4 − 7 t^2 + 1 = 9·(3/10)^2 − 7·(3/10) + 1 = −29/100 ≠ 0.
Thus det M ≠ 0, contradicting nilpotency. Hence no nilpotent M exists for n=4 under the weighted constraint.

Obstacles
- Lemma 2 shows (M^{n+2})_{1n}=0 brings no new constraint once e_1=e_2=e_3=0 are imposed; it reduces to φ=0, already implied by e_3=0 and e_1=0.
- Extending the n=4 elimination to general n likely needs the e_4 constraint (sum of 4×4 principal minors) or a precise determinant formula under the linear constraints. A uniform closed form for S_4 analogous to Lemma 1 (with cubic and linear boundary pieces) is plausible but requires careful combinatorics of 4×4 blocks and adjacent pairs.

Next steps
- Prove a general S_4 formula: e_4 as the sum of 4×4 principal minors decomposes into the pure quartic symmetric sum plus lower-degree boundary corrections; identify the linear part explicitly. Under e_1=e_2=e_3=0 and ∑ i z_i=0, show e_4 ≠ 0.
- Alternatively, develop a continuant-based elimination: use p_k = z_k p_{k−1} + p_{k−2} across k with e_1=e_2=e_3 constraints to force a normalized pattern of z’s (as in n=4), then compute p_n symbolically to show it cannot vanish.
- Cross-check small sizes n=5,6 computationally to conjecture the general boundary-linear coefficients for S_4 and guide the proof.

Summary of progress
- Fully proved the S_3 identity for all n.
- Proved the corrected exact formula (M^{n+2})_{1n} = (−1)^{n−1}(h_3 − L_n) with L_n=(n+1)∑ z_i − (z_1+z_n); clarified its redundancy under e_1=e_2=e_3=0.
- Settled n=4 completely by contradiction using e_1=e_2=e_3=0, the weighted constraint, and the continuant for det M. The mechanism suggests using e_4 in general to close the argument for arbitrary n.
