# Focused critique and rigorous additions

This round addresses correctness, clarity, and the missing use of the weighted constraint. I point out concrete issues in the notes, supply fully rigorous lemmas (with proofs), and propose auditable next steps that directly involve the weight operator W = diag(1,…,n).


Corrections and gaps to fix now

- h₃ vs e₃ vs p₃ confusion: For variables z = (z₁,…,zₙ), one has h₃ = e₁³ − 2e₁e₂ + e₃. In particular, if e₁ = ∑ zᵢ = 0, then h₃ = e₃. The earlier claim “h₃ = (2/3)∑ zᵢ³ − E₃” is incorrect. This must be corrected wherever used.
- α_{n+2} factor: The correct path-classification for α_{n+2} := (M^{n+2})_{n,1} gives α_{n+2} = h₃(z) − (n−1)∑ zᵢ (proof below). Under ∑ zᵢ=0, α_{n+2}=h₃=e₃. Thus α_{n+2}=0 forces e₃=0, and together with a_{n,3}=0 (which reads e₃ = −(z₁+zₙ) when e₁=0) one concludes z₁+zₙ=0. The “−3” factor appearing in prior notes is erroneous.
- tr(M³): The general identity is tr(M³) = ∑ zᵢ³ − 6∑ zᵢ + 3(z₁+zₙ). The shortened form tr(M³)=∑ zᵢ³ + 3(z₁+zₙ) holds only when ∑ zᵢ=0. Please standardize statements accordingly.
- Weighted condition usage: So far, the weight ∑ i zᵢ has only been repackaged (e.g., as tr(WM) or as sums of boundary entries), but not exploited to force a contradiction beyond what nilpotency already gives. We need identities where W enters essentially.


Rigorous lemmas and proofs to add

Notation: M = D + L − U with D = diag(z₁,…,zₙ), L the lower shift, U the upper shift. Let W = diag(1,…,n).

1) Commutator identities (for reference)
- [W, M] = L + U.
- [L, M] = [L, D] + E_{1,1} − E_{n,n}, with ([L, D])_{i+1,i} = zᵢ − z_{i+1}.
Proofs are standard and already essentially present; keep them in proofs.md.

2) Boundary entries of powers (left and right edges)
- For 1 ≤ k ≤ n: (M^k)_{k,1} = ∑_{j=1}^k z_j and, for 0 ≤ k ≤ n−1, (M^k)_{k+1,1} = 1.
- For 1 ≤ k ≤ n: (M^k)_{n−k+1,n} = (−1)^{k−1} ∑_{j=n−k+1}^n z_j.
Proof (sketch). Enumerate paths on the chain graph from column 1 to row k (resp. n) in k steps using D,L,U moves. Minimal-length constraints force exactly one D and no U for the left edge case, and exactly one D and no L for the right edge; signs for U’s are (−1) per U. Details as in prior round; formalize in proofs.md.

3) Weighted-sum reformulations
- tr(WM) = ∑ i zᵢ (since tr(WL)=tr(WU)=0). So the weighted constraint is exactly tr(WM) = 0.
- ∑_{k=1}^n (M^k)_{k,1} = ∑_{k=1}^n ∑_{j=1}^k z_j = (n+1)∑ zᵢ − ∑ i zᵢ. Hence if ∑ zᵢ = 0 (true for nilpotent M), the constraint ∑ i zᵢ = 0 is equivalent to ∑_{k=1}^n (M^k)_{k,1} = 0.
- Also ∑ i zᵢ = ∑_{k=1}^n T_k with T_k := ∑_{j=n−k+1}^n z_j = (−1)^{k−1}(M^k)_{n−k+1,n} (exact, no need to assume ∑ zᵢ=0).
These identities place the weighted constraint squarely into sums of specific boundary entries of powers.

4) Exact formula for α_{n+2} with proof
Let α_m := (M^m)_{n,1}. For m = n+2 there are two path-types from 1 to n in m steps:
- Type A: d = 3 diagonal steps, u = 0 up-steps, ℓ = n−1 down-steps; weight = product of the 3 diagonal z’s; summing over all placements yields h₃(z).
- Type B: d = 1 diagonal, u = 1 up-step, ℓ = n down-steps; weight = (−1)·z_i for the unique z_i chosen. The number of valid placements of the single U among the n L’s, subject to the path staying within the chain constraints, is exactly n−1 (U cannot occur before the first L nor after the last L, otherwise the path exits the 1..n strip). Thus the total contribution is −(n−1)∑ zᵢ.
Therefore
α_{n+2} = h₃(z) − (n−1)∑ zᵢ.
In particular, if ∑ zᵢ = 0, then α_{n+2} = h₃ = e₃.

5) Consequence: z₁ + zₙ = 0 under nilpotency
If M is nilpotent then α_{n+2} = 0 and ∑ zᵢ = 0, hence e₃ = 0. On the other hand, the previously verified coefficient identity a_{n,3} = 0 reads (with e₁=0)
0 = a_{n,3} = −e₃ − (z₁ + zₙ).
Thus e₃ = 0 implies z₁ + zₙ = 0. This step is sound and should replace the factor-3 argument in notes.

6) A weighted trace identity for M²
tr(WM²) = ∑_{i=1}^n i z_i^2 − (n² − 1).
Proof. Expand M² = D² + (DL + LD) − (DU + UD) + (L² + U²) − (LU + UL). Since L,U have zero diagonal, tr(WDL)=tr(WLD)=tr(WDU)=tr(WUD)=tr(WL²)=tr(WU²)=0. We have (LU)_{ii}=1 for 2≤i≤n and (UL)_{ii}=1 for 1≤i≤n−1. Hence tr(W LU) = ∑_{i=2}^n i and tr(W UL) = ∑_{i=1}^{n−1} i, so tr(W(LU+UL)) = n² − 1. The claim follows.
Remark. This shows tr(WM²) is completely explicit. While it doesn’t by itself contradict nilpotency or ∑ i zᵢ = 0, it is a reusable identity that couples W and the z’s quadratically.

7) Kernel summation-by-parts identity (weighted)
Let 0 ≠ v ∈ ker M with boundary v₀ = v_{n+1} = 0 and recurrence v_{i+1} = z_i v_i + v_{i−1}. Then
∑_{i=1}^n i z_i v_i^2 = − ∑_{i=1}^{n−1} v_i v_{i+1}.
Proof. Multiply v_{i+1} − z_i v_i − v_{i−1} = 0 by i v_i and sum i=1..n. The cross terms telescope to −∑_{i=1}^{n−1} v_i v_{i+1} using v₀ = v_{n+1} = 0 as in the analysis. This identity is new in the notes and precisely exhibits how the weighted functional interacts with a kernel vector.
Comments. On its own this does not contradict ∑ i zᵢ = 0, but it is a promising bridge to combine with other constraints (e.g., ∑ z_i v_i^2 = 0 from the unweighted pairing) and with explicit structure of v coming from the transfer recurrences.


Where the current writeup needs tightening

- Provide the full proof of item (4): α_{n+2} = h₃ − (n−1)∑ zᵢ. The path classification is simple, but the admissibility count (n−1 for the single U) must be justified carefully (e.g., via a bijection between valid placements and the n−1 interior edges of the path graph).
- Unify all uses of tr(M³) under one general identity and then state the nilpotent corollary as a separate line; currently both forms appear and may confuse the reader.
- Explicitly record the equivalence ∑ i zᵢ = 0 ⇔ tr(WM)=0, and under ∑ zᵢ=0 the equivalent form ∑_{k=1}^n (M^k)_{k,1} = 0. These translations matter when we try to craft weighted commutator arguments.
- Remove or correct the incorrect “h₃ = (2/3)∑ zᵢ³ − e₃” and the “α_{n+2} = −3 e₃” claims. Replace them with the clean chain: α_{n+2}=h₃−(n−1)∑ zᵢ; with ∑ zᵢ=0 this is α_{n+2}=e₃; under nilpotency α_{n+2}=0 so e₃=0; then a_{n,3}=0 gives z₁+zₙ=0.


Ideas to leverage the weighted constraint going forward

- W-traces: We now have tr(WM)=0 (the weighted condition) and an explicit tr(WM²). It is feasible to compute tr(WM³) explicitly (though more involved since cyclicity doesn’t neutralize W). These give concrete equations involving weighted power sums of z and short “edge” corrections. Combining tr(M^k)=0 and tr(WM^k) identities for k=1,2,3 may overdetermine z₁ and zₙ in terms of the interior, possibly enabling an induction.
- Kernel method: The two identities ∑ z_i v_i^2 = 0 and ∑ i z_i v_i^2 = −∑ v_i v_{i+1}, together with the Riccati variables w_{i+1} = z_i + 1/w_i (from v_{i+1}/v_i = z_i + 1/w_i), give a closed system whose weighted sums can be tracked. With z₁+zₙ=0 already forced by α_{n+2}, this method may yield a contradiction (e.g., by showing ∑ i z_i v_i^2 ≠ 0 unless z ≡ 0, which is impossible by e₂ = −(n−1)).
- Edge-peeling induction: With z₁+zₙ=0, re-express e₂, e₃, and a_{n,4} in terms of the middle block z₂,…,z_{n−1} and z₁. Investigate whether P_n(λ) factors as λ²P_{n−2}(λ) plus a term that is incompatible with P_n(λ)=λⁿ under the two linear relations e₁=0, ∑ i zᵢ=0. A block-determinant approach (eliminating the 1st and nth rows/columns) may show that nilpotency of M forces nilpotency of the middle (n−2)×(n−2) tridiagonal with an inherited weighted relation, enabling induction. This is precise and checkable.


Obstacles (why some routes fail)

- Coefficients and boundary entries α_{n+q} alone do not produce index-weighted terms; they depend on symmetric polynomials and small boundary corrections (z₁,zₙ), not on ∑ i zᵢ. Hence pushing α_{n+q} without W will not incorporate the weighted constraint.
- Inequalities (e.g., positivity) are unavailable: zᵢ ∈ ℂ, so Cauchy–Schwarz-type obstructions for the weighted sums do not apply.


Next steps (auditable and targeted)

1) Formalize and include in proofs.md the exact α_{n+2} identity with full combinatorial proof and a short note deducing z₁+zₙ=0 from nilpotency.
2) Compute tr(WM³) explicitly. With tr(M)=0, tr(M²)=0, tr(M³)=0 and tr(WM)=0, tr(WM²) known, and tr(WM³) (to be computed), attempt to solve for z₁ and zₙ in terms of interior z’s, then show incompatibility with e₂ = −(n−1) and e₃ = 0.
3) Develop the block-determinant (Schur complement) reduction eliminating indices 1 and n. Make precise what weighted relation the (n−2) middle block inherits from ∑ i zᵢ=0 and e₁=0, and prove an induction step (if the middle block were nilpotent under its inherited constraint, then so would M be; contrapositive yields the desired impossibility).
4) Document the kernel weighted identity (item 7) and explore whether combining it with ∑ z_i v_i^2 = 0 and z₁+zₙ=0 already forces constraints on v (e.g., via a short computation for n=4,5) that contradict e₂=−(n−1).

These items directly address the principal gap: bringing the weighted condition into identities that interact with nilpotency in a nontrivial way, while cleaning up the existing derivations for correctness and future reuse.
