This clarifies which linear combinations of the z_i occur and corrects the earlier hypothesis that a weighted sum \u2211 i z_i would appear at k = n+2.\n- Compute tr(A^4) for A := L \u2212 U and then tr(M^4) exactly in terms of z_i and nearest-neighbor products. This supplies a new necessary identity under nilpotence (tr(M^4)=0) that couples quartic, quadratic, and adjacent products of the z_i.\n- Push the matchings/continuant method one order further to give an explicit formula for the \u03bb^{n\u22124} coefficient c_{n\u22124} in det(\u03bbI\u2212M). Setting c_{n\u22124}=0 under nilpotence yields a new algebraic constraint involving e_4, e_2, nearest-neighbor sums, and boundary corrections.\n\n# Notation\n\n- M = Z + L \u2212 U, with Z = diag(z_1,\u2026,z_n), L the subdiagonal shift (ones on (i+1,i)), U the superdiagonal shift (ones on (i,i+1)). Let A := L \u2212 U.\n- e_k are the elementary symmetric polynomials in z_1,\u2026,z_n; h_k are the complete homogeneous ones. Recall h_1 = e_1, h_2 = e_1^2 \u2212 e_2, h_3 = e_1^3 \u2212 2 e_1 e_2 + e_3.\n\n# Proposition 1 (Exact formula for (M^{n+2})_{n,1})\n\nClaim. For all n \u2265 2,\n(M^{n+2})_{n,1} = h_3(z_1,\u2026,z_n) \u2212 (n+1) e_1(z) + (z_1 + z_n).\n\nProof (combinatorial path count).\nView (M^k)_{n,1} as the sum of weights of length-k words in the alphabet {L, \u2212U, Z}, acting on index positions {1,\u2026,n}, that send 1 to n while respecting the boundary. Here L increases the index by +1 with weight +1, U decreases by \u22121 with weight \u22121 (because of the \u2212 sign in M), and Z keeps the index fixed with weight z_{current}.\n\nFor k = n+2, the net displacement must be n\u22121, hence if s is the number of Z\u2019s and r the number of U\u2019s, then the system\n- r + \u2113 + s = n+2,\n- \u2113 \u2212 r = n\u22121,\nforces r = (3 \u2212 s)/2, so s is odd and s \u2208 {1,3}. Thus two disjoint classes of words contribute:\n\n1) s = 3, r = 0, \u2113 = n\u22121: no U, n\u22121 copies of L, and three Z\u2019s. The path visits indices 1,2,\u2026,n monotonically; inserting three Z\u2019s at visited vertices produces exactly h_3(z). Contribution: h_3.\n\n2) s = 1, r = 1, \u2113 = n: one Z, one U, and n copies of L. Validity exactly requires the unique U not to be the first step (to avoid leaving the path at 0) and not the last (to avoid overshooting n+1 before the U occurs). There are n\u22121 valid U-positions t \u2208 {2,\u2026,n} in the word of L/U steps. For a fixed U-position t, the index trajectory along the L/U steps is\n1,2,3,\u2026,t\u22121, t, t\u22121, t, t+1,\u2026,n,\nand the coefficient of z_j from this t is the number of visits to level j in this trajectory. Summing over t = 2,\u2026,n gives the total coefficient c_j of z_j in the \u201cone-U-one-Z\u201d contribution. A direct count yields\n- c_1 = n, c_n = n,\n- c_j = n+1 for 2 \u2264 j \u2264 n\u22121.\nTherefore the total \u201cone-U-one-Z\u201d contribution equals \u2212\u2211_{j=1}^n c_j z_j = \u2212[n z_1 + (n+1)\u2211_{j=2}^{n\u22121} z_j + n z_n] = \u2212[(n+1) e_1 \u2212 (z_1 + z_n)].\n\nCombining the two classes proves the formula. \u220e\n\nCorollary (consistency with nilpotence). Under nilpotence, e_1 = 0 and M^{n+2} = 0, hence (M^{n+2})_{n,1} = 0. Using h_3 = e_3 when e_1=0, the proposition reduces to e_3 + (z_1 + z_n) = 0, which matches the known \u03bb^{n\u22123} coefficient identity and tr(M^3)=0 (Newton identities). Thus the k = n+2 boundary identity yields no new information beyond e_3 = \u2212(z_1 + z_n).\n\nRemark. This corrects the earlier speculation that (M^{n+2})_{n,1} would feature the weighted sum \u2211 i z_i; it does not.\n\n# Lemma 2 (tr(A^4) = 6n\u221210)\n\nLet A = L \u2212 U. Then A^2 has diagonal entries \u22121 at i \u2208 {1,n} and \u22122 for 2 \u2264 i \u2264 n\u22121, and ones on the second sub/super-diagonals; all other entries zero. Therefore\ntr(A^4) = \u2211_{i,j} (A^2)_{i,j}^2 = [1^2 + 1^2 + 4(n\u22122)] + 2(n\u22122) = 6n \u2212 10.\nThis holds for all n \u2265 2. \u220e\n\n# Proposition 3 (Exact formula for tr(M^4))\n\nFor M = Z + A with A = L \u2212 U,\ntr(M^4) = \u2211_{i=1}^n z_i^4 \u2212 4 z_1^2 \u2212 8\u2211_{i=2}^{n\u22121} z_i^2 \u2212 4 z_n^2 \u2212 4 \u2211_{i=1}^{n\u22121} z_i z_{i+1} + (6n \u2212 10).\n\nProof.\nExpand M^4 = (Z + A)^4 and use cyclicity of trace. Terms with an odd number of A\u2019s have zero trace: for tr(Z^3 A) and tr(Z A^3) the diagonal of the odd power of A vanishes; likewise any cyclic variant. The 2-A terms reduce, up to cyclic equivalence, to two copies each of tr(Z^2 A^2), tr(Z A Z A), tr(Z A^2 Z). Since Z is diagonal, tr(Z^2 A^2) = tr(Z A^2 Z) = \u2211 z_i^2 (A^2)_{i,i} = \u2212z_1^2 \u2212 2\u2211_{i=2}^{n\u22121} z_i^2 \u2212 z_n^2, and a direct 2\u00d72 computation on neighbors gives tr(Z A Z A) = \u22122\u2211_{i=1}^{n\u22121} z_i z_{i+1}. Finally, add tr(Z^4) and tr(A^4) from Lemma 2. \u220e\n\nConsequence under nilpotence. Since tr(M^k) = 0 for all k \u2265 1, we obtain two constraints:\n- tr(M^2) = 0 \u21d2 \u2211 z_i^2 = 2(n\u22121),\n- tr(M^4) = 0 \u21d2 \u2211 z_i^4 \u2212 4 z_1^2 \u2212 8\u2211_{i=2}^{n\u22121} z_i^2 \u2212 4 z_n^2 \u2212 4 \u2211_{i=1}^{n\u22121} z_i z_{i+1} + (6n \u2212 10) = 0.\nThese are independent of the weighted condition and will be used together with it in subsequent steps.\n\n# Proposition 4 (Explicit \u03bb^{n\u22124} coefficient via matchings)\n\nWrite \u0394_n(\u03bb) = det(\u03bb I \u2212 M). Then\nCoefficient[\u03bb^{n\u22124}] = c_{n\u22124} = e_4 + Q + m_2,\nwhere m_2 = C(n\u22122,2) is the number of 2-edge matchings in P_n, and\nQ = \u2211_{edges e} \u2211_{i<j, i,j \u2209 V(e)} z_i z_j = \u2211_{i<j} c(i,j) z_i z_j,\nwith explicit edge-avoidance multiplicities c(i,j):\n- If |i\u2212j| \u2265 2 (nonadjacent), c(i,j) = (n\u22121) \u2212 deg(i) \u2212 deg(j), i.e., n\u22125 if both interior, n\u22124 if one endpoint is a boundary vertex and the other is interior, and n\u22123 if {i,j} = {1,n}.\n- If j = i+1 (adjacent), c(i,i+1) = (n\u22121) \u2212 (deg(i) + deg(i+1) \u2212 1), i.e., n\u22124 if 2 \u2264 i \u2264 n\u22122, and n\u22123 if i \u2208 {1, n\u22121}.\nEquivalently, grouping by structures,\nQ = (n\u22125) (e_2 \u2212 A) + [(n\u22123)(z_1 z_2 + z_{n\u22121} z_n) + (n\u22124) \u2211_{i=2}^{n\u22122} z_i z_{i+1}] + [z_1 \u2211_{j=3}^n z_j + z_n \u2211_{i=1}^{n\u22122} z_i],\nwhere A = \u2211_{i=1}^{n\u22121} z_i z_{i+1}.\n\nProof.\nBy the standard continuant/matching expansion for tridiagonal determinants (with the signless edge weight here, since in \u03bbI\u2212M the off-diagonal products contribute +1), the \u03bb^{n\u22124} term receives contributions from matchings of size m with n\u22122m \u2265 n\u22124 \u21d2 m \u2208 {0,1,2}. For m=0 we get e_4. For m=1, we must pick two z\u2019s among the unmatched vertices; for each pair {i,j} this is allowed by all edges e that avoid i and j, counted by c(i,j) as stated (deg(1)=deg(n)=1, others 2). For m=2, all unmatched vertices are taken as \u03bb, giving +1 per 2-edge matching, i.e., C(n\u22122,2). The regrouping identity for Q follows by separating adjacent vs. nonadjacent pairs and compensating boundary cases explicitly. \u220e\n\nCorollary under nilpotence. If M is nilpotent then c_{n\u22124} = 0. Together with\n- e_1 = 0 (coefficient of \u03bb^{n\u22121}),\n- e_2 = \u2212(n\u22121) (coefficient of \u03bb^{n\u22122}),\n- e_3 = \u2212(z_1 + z_n) (coefficient of \u03bb^{n\u22123}),\nthis yields a concrete algebraic relation among e_4, nearest-neighbor sums A, and boundary terms z_1,z_2,z_{n\u22121},z_n. This is a new independent constraint to combine with trace(M^4)=0 and the weighted condition \u2211 i z_i = 0 in the next step.\n\n# Examples/checks\n\n- For n=3, Proposition 1 gives (M^5)_{3,1} = h_3 \u2212 4 e_1 + (z_1 + z_3). Under e_1=0, this equals e_3 + (z_1 + z_3), coherent with e_3 = \u2212(z_1 + z_3).\n- For n\u22652, Lemma 2 yields tr(A^4) = 6n\u221210. Direct computation for n=2 gives tr(A^4)=2, matching 6\u00b72\u221210.\n\n# Obstacles and corrections\n\n- The earlier heuristic that (M^{n+2})_{n,1} would directly involve \u2211 i z_i is false. The exact formula shows dependence only on h_3 and the unweighted sum e_1 with end correction (z_1+z_n).\n- The \u03bb^{n\u22124} coefficient bookkeeping is delicate near the boundary; the explicit c(i,j) coefficients above account for all such cases cleanly.\n\n# Next steps\n\n- Use c_{n\u22124}=0 with e_1=0, e_2=\u2212(n\u22121), e_3=\u2212(z_1+z_n) to solve for e_4 and A = \u2211 z_i z_{i+1} in terms of boundary variables, then combine with tr(M^4)=0 to eliminate e_4 and A, producing a relation solely among z_1,z_2,z_{n\u22121},z_n. Test whether this, together with the weighted condition \u2211 i z_i = 0, forces z_1=z_n=0 and peel the ends (induction).\n- Derive analogous explicit formulas for (M^{n+3})_{n,1}. The one-U occupancy becomes triangular-number\u2013like for two U\u2019s (s=0) and mixed terms for s=2; these should produce nonuniform linear coefficients in z_j that better correlate with the weight vector (1,2,\u2026,n). If successful, the vanishing of (M^{n+3})_{n,1} under nilpotence may interact directly with \u2211 i z_i = 0.\n- Leverage the commutator identity 0 = tr([L,M] M^{k\u22121}) = (M^{k\u22121})_{11} \u2212 (M^{k\u22121})_{nn} + \u2211_{i=1}^{n\u22121} (z_i \u2212 z_{i+1}) (M^{k\u22121})_{i,i+1} to connect nearest-neighbor products and boundary values. Evaluate explicitly for k=2,3,4 under nilpotence to get additional linear relations.\n\n# Summary of new, reusable results\n\n- Exact boundary identity: (M^{n+2})_{n,1} = h_3 \u2212 (n+1) e_1 + (z_1 + z_n); under nilpotence (e_1=0) this reduces to e_3 = \u2212(z_1+z_n).\n- tr(A^4) = 6n \u2212 10 for A = L \u2212 U.\n- tr(M^4) = \u2211 z_i^4 \u2212 4 z_1^2 \u2212 8\u2211_{i=2}^{n\u22121} z_i^2 \u2212 4 z_n^2 \u2212 4 \u2211_{i=1}^{n\u22121} z_i z_{i+1} + 6n \u2212 10.\n- Explicit \u03bb^{n\u22124} coefficient c_{n\u22124} in terms of e_4, e_2, nearest-neighbor sums, boundary corrections, and C(n\u22122,2). These constraints are all rigorously derived and ready to be combined with the weighted condition to seek a contradiction inductively.\n"
