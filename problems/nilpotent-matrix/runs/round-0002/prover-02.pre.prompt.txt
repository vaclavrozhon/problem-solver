=== SYSTEM ===
You are a research mathematician. 

You are being run in a loop with a verifier that checks rigor. Your goal is to make **incremental, auditable progress**. You are not expected to solve the problem at once, but to generate new, testable ideas.

Inputs: 
- task statement 
- notes.md (informal progress & exploratory work; optional) 
- proofs.md (rigorously proven results & detailed proofs; optional) 
- output.md (main results, rigorously presented; optional) 
- summary of past rounds (optional) 
- possibly some reference papers.

What counts as progress:
- Extract lemmas/heuristics from literature. Generalize them for current task, or explain why they could be helpful. 
- Explore small examples & try to break your own claims with toy counterexamples.
- Prove special cases or nontrivial bounds.
- If an approach fails, explain crisply why.
- Point out flaws in notes.md, proofs.md, or output.md (you are not rewriting these files yourself, that's verifier's job).

**Discipline.** 
- Read notes, outputs, summaries carefully before proposing new work. 
- Reference papers if relevant, but focus on *incremental, checkable steps*. 
- Do not output Markdown code fences, only raw JSON. 
- Length: at least ~200 words. 
- Organize your reasoning with short headings (Ideas, Examples, Obstacles, Next steps), make clear what your claims are and how they are supported. 

**Output**: Write your analysis as Markdown that includes both informal reasoning and any rigorous proofs. The verifier will decide what goes into notes.md, proofs.md, and output.md.

**Return strictly JSON**:
{
  "content": "Your complete analysis in Markdown (KaTeX allowed). Include reasoning, examples, proofs, failed attempts, intuitions - everything for the verifier to review."

Let M be a tridiagonal matrix with complex numbers z_1, z_2, ..., z_n on diagonal, all entries right below the main diagonal are 1 and all entries right above are -1, e.g.

z_1 -1   0
1    z_2 -1
0   1       z_3

Furthermore, the numbers on diagonal satisfy linear condition
z_1 + 2 z_2 + 3z_3 + ... n z_n =0.

Prove that there is no nilpotent matrix of this form.

Setup. Let M be n×n tridiagonal with diagonal z_1,…,z_n, subdiagonal entries 1 and superdiagonal entries −1. Let D=diag(z_1,…,z_n), E be the subdiagonal shift, F the superdiagonal shift. Then M=D+E−F. Let H=diag(1,2,…,n). The condition is Σ_{i=1}^n i z_i = tr(HM) = 0. We work for n≥2 (n=1 yields the zero 1×1 matrix, which is nilpotent).

Verified identities.
- Commutators: [H,E]=E, [H,F]=−F, [H,D]=0, hence [H,M]=E+F. The similarity flow M(t)=e^{tH}Me^{−tH}=D+e^t E−e^{−t}F will be useful.
- Diagonal of M^2: (M^2)_{ii}=z_i^2−2 for 2≤i≤n−1, and z_i^2−1 for i=1,n, so tr(M^2)=Σ z_i^2 − 2(n−1).
- tr(M^3)=Σ z_i^3 − 3(z_1+2z_2+⋯+2 z_{n−1}+z_n). Using Σ z_i=0, this is Σ z_i^3 + 3(z_1+z_n).
- Endpoint path counts: (M^{n−1})_{1n}=(−1)^{n−1} (unique all-up path). (M^{n})_{1n}=(−1)^{n−1} Σ z_i (exactly one stay). (M^{n+1})_{1n}=(−1)^{n−1}(h_2(z) − (n−1)) where h_2=Σ_{i≤j} z_i z_j (two stays or one down step).
- Consequence for nilpotent M: tr(M^k)=0 for all k≥1, hence Σ z_i=0 and Σ z_i^2=2(n−1), and Σ z_i^3=3(z_1+2⋯+2+z_n). Also (M^{n+1})_{1n}=0 gives h_2 = n−1, consistent with Σ z_i^2=2(n−1) since h_2 = (Σ z_i^2 + (Σ z_i)^2)/2.

Small n resolved. For n=2 and n=3, imposing Σ i z_i=0 together with nilpotency constraints leads to contradictions; hence no nilpotent matrix of the prescribed form exists for n≤3.

3×3 principal minors (status). For n=4, a direct computation shows the sum of all 3×3 principal minors equals Σ_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k + (2 z_1 + z_2 + z_3 + 2 z_4). This matches the general ansatz S_3 = Σ_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k + (n−3) Σ z_i + (z_1+z_n) (which reduces for n=4 to 2z_1+z_2+z_3+2z_4). We need a uniform proof for all n.

Planned route to contradiction.
1) Prove the general formula for S_3: S_3 = Σ_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k + (n−3) Σ z_i + (z_1+z_n). Under nilpotency, e_3=S_3=0, thus with Σ z_i=0 we get Σ_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k = −(z_1+z_n).
2) Compute (M^{n+2})_{1n} exactly by path counting. Expect: (−1)^{n−1}(h_3(z) − 3φ(z)), where φ(z)=z_1+2z_2+⋯+2 z_{n−1}+z_n. Nilpotency forces (M^{n+2})_{1n}=0, hence h_3=3φ.
3) Eliminate the cubic quantities using identities relating h_3 and Σ_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k, together with Σ z_i=0 and Σ z_i^2=2(n−1), to isolate a nonzero linear boundary form that contradicts Σ i z_i=0.

Action items for next round.
- Prover 2: Supply a complete proof of the S_3 formula for all n.
- Prover 3: Prove the exact formula for (M^{n+2})_{1n}, including the −3 coefficient on φ(z).
- Prover 1: Cross-verify both identities, correct the earlier weight sketch for c_{n,3}, and attempt the elimination for n=4 to confirm inconsistency before generalizing.

# Main Results




=== Round 1 Summary ===

This round verified key structural identities for the tridiagonal matrix M (diagonal z_1..z_n, subdiagonal 1, superdiagonal −1) under the linear boundary constraint Σ i z_i = 0. Proven/verified: [H,M]=E+F and the similarity flow; tr(M^2)=Σ z_i^2 − 2(n−1); tr(M^3)=Σ z_i^3 − 3φ(z) with φ=z_1+2z_2+⋯+2z_{n−1}+z_n. Endpoint path counts gave (M^{n−1})_{1n}=(-1)^{n−1}, (M^n)_{1n}=(-1)^{n−1}Σ z_i, and (M^{n+1})_{1n}=(-1)^{n−1}(h_2−(n−1)). From nilpotency we obtain Σ z_i=0, Σ z_i^2=2(n−1), h_2=n−1, and Σ z_i^3=3φ(z). Cases n=2,3 are ruled out by contradiction. Remaining plan: (i) prove a general formula for S_3 (sum of 3×3 principal minors), (ii) derive an exact path-count formula for (M^{n+2})_{1n} (expected (−1)^{n−1}(h_3−3φ)), and (iii) eliminate cubic terms to reach a linear boundary contradiction.

Overall: Good structural groundwork (commutators, similarity flow, path-counting, low-degree trace identities), and n=2,3 are convincingly ruled out. However, a general contradiction for arbitrary n is not yet established. The key missing piece is an identity that couples the fixed linear constraint Σ i z_i = 0 with the rigid, z-independent “corner” behavior of powers (or with characteristic-polynomial coefficients) strongly enough to force a contradiction.

Audit highlights and corrections
- P1: Lemmas 1–6 are correct and useful. Cor. 6.1 actually holds without assuming nilpotency (it follows from [H,M]M^{n−2} identity and Lemma 5); it becomes informative only when combined with evaluated entries of M^{n−2}. The claimed linear weights for c_{n,3} (“w_1=w_2=w_{n−1}=w_n=n−2, interior n−1”) appear incorrect: for n=4, the sum of 3×3 principal minors has linear part 2z_1+z_2+z_3+2z_4, not all 2’s. See P2 remark below.
- P2: Path counts for (M^{n−1})_{1n} and (M^n)_{1n} are correct. The M^2/M^3 trace formulas are correct (tr(M^3)=Σ z_i^3−3(z_1+2⋯+2+z_n)); using Σ z_i=0 gives tr(M^3)=Σ z_i^3+3(z_1+z_n). Your proposed formula for the sum of 3×3 principal minors S_3 is plausible and matches n=3 and n=4 checks: S_3 = Σ_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k + (n−3) Σ z_i + (z_1+z_n). This needs a clean, general proof.
- P3: The expansion tr(M^3)=Σ z_i^3−3(z_1+2⋯+2+z_n) is neatly derived; the endpoint formula (M^{n+1})_{1n}=(−1)^{n−1}(h_2−(n−1)) is correct. The conjectured (M^{n+2})_{1n} linear term proportional to φ(z)=z_1+2z_2+⋯+2z_{n−1}+z_n is consistent with combinatorics; please formalize it fully and determine the exact coefficient (expected −3).

Triage and next steps
- Prove S_3 exactly: sum all 3×3 principal minors and show S_3 = Σ_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k + (n−3)Σ z_i + (z_1+z_n). Then, using nilpotency (e_3=S_3=0) and Σ z_i=0, get Σ_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k = −(z_1+z_n).
- Compute (M^{n+2})_{1n} exactly via paths. Target: (−1)^{n−1}(h_3 − 3φ(z)), where φ(z)=z_1+2z_2+⋯+2z_{n−1}+z_n. Nilpotency forces this to vanish. Combine with tr(M^3)=0 (which gives Σ z_i^3=3φ(z)) and the e_3=0 relation to eliminate cubic terms and isolate a boundary linear form contradicting Σ i z_i=0.
- As a sanity check, carry out the full elimination for n=4 using: Σ z_i=0, Σ z_i^2=2(n−1), tr(M^3)=0, S_3=0, and (M^{n+2})_{1n}=0. If inconsistent, abstract the mechanism for general n.

Please avoid relying on sketchy c_{n,3} weights; instead provide a complete proof of S_3 and the k=n+2 endpoint identity. These two steps are the most promising route to close the problem.
