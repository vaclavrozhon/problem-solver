For any matrix, the elementary symmetric sums e_k of its eigenvalues satisfy Newton identities. In particular,\\n- e_1 = p_1,\\n- e_2 = (p_1^2 \u2212 p_2)/2,\\n- e_3 = (p_1^3 \u2212 3 p_1 p_2 + 2 p_3)/6.\\n\\nFor our M, one has p_1 = \u2211 z_i, p_2 = \u2211 z_i^2 \u2212 2(n\u22121), p_3 = \u2211 z_i^3 \u2212 3\u03c6 with \u03c6 := z_1 + 2z_2 + \u22ef + 2z_{n\u22121} + z_n. Expanding with the standard identities\\n(\u2211 z_i)^3 = \u2211 z_i^3 + 3\u2211_{i\u2260j} z_i^2 z_j + 6\u2211_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k,\\n(\u2211 z_i)(\u2211 z_i^2) = \u2211 z_i^3 + \u2211_{i\u2260j} z_i^2 z_j,\\none obtains complete cancellation of the cubic and \u201cmixed quadratic-linear\u201d terms and gets\\n\\ne_3(M) = \u2211_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k + (n\u22121)\u2211_{i=1}^n z_i \u2212 \u03c6.\\nSince \u03c6 = (n\u22122)\u2211 z_i + (z_1 + z_n), this is equivalent to the tidy form\\n\\nS_3 := e_3(M) = \u2211_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k + (n\u22123)\u2211_{i=1}^n z_i + (z_1 + z_n).\\n\\nThis matches n=3 (S_3 = det M) and n=4 checks in the notes. In particular, for nilpotent M (all e_k = 0) and using \u2211 z_i = 0, we get\\n\u2211_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k = \u2212(z_1 + z_n).\\nThis identity will be used below.\\n\\n# Corrected endpoint identity for k = n+2\\nThe conjectured formula (M^{n+2})_{1n} = (\u22121)^{n\u22121}(h_3 \u2212 3\u03c6) is false. The exact formula is:\\n\\nClaim. For all n \u2265 2,\\n(M^{n+2})_{1n} = (\u22121)^{n\u22121} ( h_3(z_1,\u2026,z_n) \u2212 S ),\\nwhere S = \u2211_{j=1}^n c_j z_j with c_1 = c_n = n and c_j = n+1 for 2 \u2264 j \u2264 n\u22121. Equivalently, S = (n+1)\u2211_{j=1}^n z_j \u2212 (z_1 + z_n).\\n\\nProof (combinatorial, checkable). Expand M^{n+2} = (D + E \u2212 F)^{n+2} and select the (1,n) entry as a sum over paths on {1,\u2026,n} of length n+2, starting at n and ending at 1. Each step is either an edge move: down (\u2212F, weight \u22121) or up (E, weight +1), or a stay (D, weight z at the current vertex). Let a,b,s be the numbers of down, up, and stay steps. To go from n to 1 in n+2 steps, the feasible types are exactly:\\n- Type I: (a,b,s) = (n\u22121, 0, 3): monotone all-down edge path with three stays inserted. Total weight over all such words is (\u22121)^{n\u22121} h_3(z), by the standard \u201cstays distributed over the n vertices on a monotone path\u201d argument.\\n- Type II: (a,b,s) = (n, 1, 1): one up-step, n down-steps, and one stay. The edge-step weight is (\u22121)^n. For a fixed position r \u2208 {1,\u2026,n\u22121} of the up-step (after r initial down-steps), the list of insertion slots (between edges, including start and end) visits the vertex sequence\\n[n, n\u22121, \u2026, n\u2212r, n\u2212r+1, n\u2212r, \u2026, 1],\\nso each vertex appears exactly once except the adjacent pair {n\u2212r, n\u2212r+1} which appear twice. Summing the single stay over all r yields the total coefficient of z_j equal to\\nc_j = number of r with j visited in the slot list =\\n- c_1 = n,\\n- c_n = n,\\n- c_j = n+1 for 2 \u2264 j \u2264 n\u22121.\\nHence the total Type II contribution is (\u22121)^n S with S as above. Summing Type I and II yields the claim.\\n\\nSanity checks.\\n- n=2: (M^3)_{1,2} = \u2212(h_2 \u2212 1) as previously verified.\\n- n=3: Take z = (1,2,3). Direct computation gives (M^5)_{1,3} = 70. Our formula gives h_3 = 90 and S = (n+1)\u2211 z \u2212 (z_1 + z_3) = 4\u00b76 \u2212 (1+3) = 24 \u2212 4 = 20, so h_3 \u2212 S = 70, matching.\\n\\nConsequence under nilpotency. If M is nilpotent then \u2211 z_i = 0 and (from the S_3 formula) \u2211_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k = \u2212(z_1+z_n). Using the symmetric-function identity h_3 = e_1^3 \u2212 2 e_1 e_2 + e_3^z (where e_k^z are the elementary symmetric polynomials in the z\u2019s), we get under \u2211 z_i = 0 that h_3 = e_3^z. Then\\n- S reduces to \u2212(z_1 + z_n), and\\n- e_3(M) = e_3^z + (z_1 + z_n) = 0.\\nHence our endpoint formula simplifies to (M^{n+2})_{1n} = (\u22121)^{n\u22121}(e_3^z + z_1 + z_n) = (\u22121)^{n\u22121} e_3(M) = 0. In other words, the k = n+2 endpoint identity is redundant once e_3(M) = 0 and \u2211 z_i = 0 are imposed. Therefore the prior plan\u2019s Step 2 (aiming for a new independent constraint from k = n+2) will not close the argument.\\n\\n# Small-n status\\n- n=2: Already ruled out (trace and determinant with the extra linear constraint contradict).\\n- n=3: Explicit elimination (using \u2211 z_i = 0, \u2211 z_i^2 = 4, z_1 z_2 z_3 = \u2212(z_1+z_3), and z_1 + 2z_2 + 3 z_3 = 0) has no solution (one quickly deduces z_1^2 = 1 from the linear constraint, contradicting the quadratic constraint x^2 \u2212 x + 1 = 0 deduced from \u2211 z_i^2 = 4 and z_1 z_3 = 1). This matches the notes\u2019 claim.\\n- n=4: A consistent elimination should be doable with the identities on hand, but a uniform mechanism is still missing.\\n\\n# Clarity/notation issues to fix\\n- Distinguish clearly between e_k(M), the characteristic-polynomial coefficients of the matrix M, and the elementary symmetric polynomials e_k^z in the diagonal variables z_1,\u2026,z_n. The S_3 formula expresses e_3(M) in terms of e_3^z and boundary linear terms. Likewise, h_m refers throughout to the complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials in the z-variables, not in the eigenvalues.\\n- Fix orientation conventions once: we use (M^{\u00b7})_{1n} (row 1, column n). This yields the signs reported above.\\n- Replace the \u201cexpected \u22123 \u03c6\u201d claim by the correct k = n+2 formula with proof above.\\n\\n# Next steps (precise and checkable)\\n1) Record and use the proven S_3 formula in the writeup. Under nilpotency and \u2211 z_i = 0, it pins down e_3^z = \u2212(z_1 + z_n).\\n2) Replace the conjectured k = n+2 endpoint identity with the proven one. Note its redundancy under nilpotency + \u2211 z_i = 0.\\n3) Compute e_4(M) via Newton: e_4 = (p_1^4 \u2212 6 p_1^2 p_2 + 3 p_2^2 + 8 p_1 p_3 \u2212 6 p_4)/24. We already have p_1, p_2, p_3; derive p_4 = tr(M^4). This is feasible by closed-walk counting:\\n   - Diagonal contribution from D^4: \u2211 z_i^4.\\n   - Words with two D\u2019s and two edge moves (one up, one down) give a linear term in z with computable endpoint weights.\\n   - Pure edge words (four edge moves) contribute a constant depending on endpoints (Dyck vs unrestricted walks); cross-check by small n computations.\\n   Deliver an explicit formula for p_4, then e_4(M) in terms of e_4^z and boundary linear/quadratic corrections.\\n4) Impose nilpotency e_4(M) = 0 together with \u2211 z_i = 0 and the given boundary linear constraint \u2211 i z_i = 0. Aim to derive a contradiction uniformly in n. As a sanity check, carry out the full elimination for n=4 numerically/symbolically to verify inconsistency.\\n5) Optional structural conjecture: Under \u2211 z_i = 0, (M^{n\u22121+m})_{1n} = (\u22121)^{n\u22121} e_m(M) for m = 1,2,3 (verified). Prove this by induction on m. This would explain why endpoint identities align with e_m(M) and prevent redundant steps.\\n\\n# Summary of improvements\\n- Proved S_3 exactly via Newton identities: S_3 = \u2211_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k + (n\u22123)\u2211 z_i + (z_1+z_n).\\n- Corrected and proved the k = n+2 endpoint identity: (M^{n+2})_{1n} = (\u22121)^{n\u22121}(h_3 \u2212 [(n+1)\u2211 z_i \u2212 (z_1 + z_n)]). The earlier \u201c\u22123 \u03c6\u201d conjecture is false (explicit countercheck at n=3); under nilpotency + \u2211 z_i = 0 this identity is redundant.\\n- Recommended pivot: compute p_4 = tr(M^4), then e_4(M), and use e_4(M) = 0 with the boundary linear constraint to force a contradiction for general n. This is a concrete, checkable next step.\\n\"}",
