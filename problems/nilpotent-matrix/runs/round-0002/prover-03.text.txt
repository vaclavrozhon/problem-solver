# Audit and Priorities
- The structural groundwork is solid: M = D + E − F with D = diag(z_i), E subdiagonal, F superdiagonal, H = diag(1,…,n) and [H,M] = E+F are correct and useful.
- Low-degree trace identities tr(M^2), tr(M^3) are correct. Consequences for nilpotent M: ∑ z_i = 0, ∑ z_i^2 = 2(n−1), tr(M^3) = 0 ⇒ ∑ z_i^3 = 3φ with φ = z_1 + 2z_2 + ⋯ + 2z_{n−1} + z_n.
- Endpoint entries: (M^{n−1})_{1n} = (−1)^{n−1}, (M^{n})_{1n} = (−1)^{n−1}∑ z_i, and (M^{n+1})_{1n} = (−1)^{n−1}(h_2 − (n−1)) are correct (with h_2 := ∑_{i≤j} z_i z_j in the z-variables).
- Edge case n=1: the 1×1 zero matrix is nilpotent. The claim must be for n ≥ 2.

The main gaps to address now:
1) Prove the general formula for the sum S_3 of all 3×3 principal minors (claimed in the notes) rigorously.
2) Correct the conjectured formula for (M^{n+2})_{1n}. The expected −3·φ coefficient is inconsistent with explicit computation. A precise formula is needed.
3) Reassess the planned route: the k = n+2 endpoint identity, once corrected, appears to be redundant under nilpotency and ∑ z_i = 0. A different invariant is needed (likely e_4 via tr(M^4)).

# Rigorous result: S_3 via Newton identities
Let p_k := tr(M^k). For any matrix, the elementary symmetric sums e_k of its eigenvalues satisfy Newton identities. In particular,
- e_1 = p_1,
- e_2 = (p_1^2 − p_2)/2,
- e_3 = (p_1^3 − 3 p_1 p_2 + 2 p_3)/6.

For our M, one has p_1 = ∑ z_i, p_2 = ∑ z_i^2 − 2(n−1), p_3 = ∑ z_i^3 − 3φ with φ := z_1 + 2z_2 + ⋯ + 2z_{n−1} + z_n. Expanding with the standard identities
(∑ z_i)^3 = ∑ z_i^3 + 3∑_{i≠j} z_i^2 z_j + 6∑_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k,
(∑ z_i)(∑ z_i^2) = ∑ z_i^3 + ∑_{i≠j} z_i^2 z_j,
one obtains complete cancellation of the cubic and “mixed quadratic-linear” terms and gets

e_3(M) = ∑_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k + (n−1)∑_{i=1}^n z_i − φ.
Since φ = (n−2)∑ z_i + (z_1 + z_n), this is equivalent to the tidy form

S_3 := e_3(M) = ∑_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k + (n−3)∑_{i=1}^n z_i + (z_1 + z_n).

This matches n=3 (S_3 = det M) and n=4 checks in the notes. In particular, for nilpotent M (all e_k = 0) and using ∑ z_i = 0, we get
∑_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k = −(z_1 + z_n).
This identity will be used below.

# Corrected endpoint identity for k = n+2
The conjectured formula (M^{n+2})_{1n} = (−1)^{n−1}(h_3 − 3φ) is false. The exact formula is:

Claim. For all n ≥ 2,
(M^{n+2})_{1n} = (−1)^{n−1} ( h_3(z_1,…,z_n) − S ),
where S = ∑_{j=1}^n c_j z_j with c_1 = c_n = n and c_j = n+1 for 2 ≤ j ≤ n−1. Equivalently, S = (n+1)∑_{j=1}^n z_j − (z_1 + z_n).

Proof (combinatorial, checkable). Expand M^{n+2} = (D + E − F)^{n+2} and select the (1,n) entry as a sum over paths on {1,…,n} of length n+2, starting at n and ending at 1. Each step is either an edge move: down (−F, weight −1) or up (E, weight +1), or a stay (D, weight z at the current vertex). Let a,b,s be the numbers of down, up, and stay steps. To go from n to 1 in n+2 steps, the feasible types are exactly:
- Type I: (a,b,s) = (n−1, 0, 3): monotone all-down edge path with three stays inserted. Total weight over all such words is (−1)^{n−1} h_3(z), by the standard “stays distributed over the n vertices on a monotone path” argument.
- Type II: (a,b,s) = (n, 1, 1): one up-step, n down-steps, and one stay. The edge-step weight is (−1)^n. For a fixed position r ∈ {1,…,n−1} of the up-step (after r initial down-steps), the list of insertion slots (between edges, including start and end) visits the vertex sequence
[n, n−1, …, n−r, n−r+1, n−r, …, 1],
so each vertex appears exactly once except the adjacent pair {n−r, n−r+1} which appear twice. Summing the single stay over all r yields the total coefficient of z_j equal to
c_j = number of r with j visited in the slot list =
- c_1 = n,
- c_n = n,
- c_j = n+1 for 2 ≤ j ≤ n−1.
Hence the total Type II contribution is (−1)^n S with S as above. Summing Type I and II yields the claim.

Sanity checks.
- n=2: (M^3)_{1,2} = −(h_2 − 1) as previously verified.
- n=3: Take z = (1,2,3). Direct computation gives (M^5)_{1,3} = 70. Our formula gives h_3 = 90 and S = (n+1)∑ z − (z_1 + z_3) = 4·6 − (1+3) = 24 − 4 = 20, so h_3 − S = 70, matching.

Consequence under nilpotency. If M is nilpotent then ∑ z_i = 0 and (from the S_3 formula) ∑_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k = −(z_1+z_n). Using the symmetric-function identity h_3 = e_1^3 − 2 e_1 e_2 + e_3^z (where e_k^z are the elementary symmetric polynomials in the z’s), we get under ∑ z_i = 0 that h_3 = e_3^z. Then
- S reduces to −(z_1 + z_n), and
- e_3(M) = e_3^z + (z_1 + z_n) = 0.
Hence our endpoint formula simplifies to (M^{n+2})_{1n} = (−1)^{n−1}(e_3^z + z_1 + z_n) = (−1)^{n−1} e_3(M) = 0. In other words, the k = n+2 endpoint identity is redundant once e_3(M) = 0 and ∑ z_i = 0 are imposed. Therefore the prior plan’s Step 2 (aiming for a new independent constraint from k = n+2) will not close the argument.

# Small-n status
- n=2: Already ruled out (trace and determinant with the extra linear constraint contradict).
- n=3: Explicit elimination (using ∑ z_i = 0, ∑ z_i^2 = 4, z_1 z_2 z_3 = −(z_1+z_3), and z_1 + 2z_2 + 3 z_3 = 0) has no solution (one quickly deduces z_1^2 = 1 from the linear constraint, contradicting the quadratic constraint x^2 − x + 1 = 0 deduced from ∑ z_i^2 = 4 and z_1 z_3 = 1). This matches the notes’ claim.
- n=4: A consistent elimination should be doable with the identities on hand, but a uniform mechanism is still missing.

# Clarity/notation issues to fix
- Distinguish clearly between e_k(M), the characteristic-polynomial coefficients of the matrix M, and the elementary symmetric polynomials e_k^z in the diagonal variables z_1,…,z_n. The S_3 formula expresses e_3(M) in terms of e_3^z and boundary linear terms. Likewise, h_m refers throughout to the complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials in the z-variables, not in the eigenvalues.
- Fix orientation conventions once: we use (M^{·})_{1n} (row 1, column n). This yields the signs reported above.
- Replace the “expected −3 φ” claim by the correct k = n+2 formula with proof above.

# Next steps (precise and checkable)
1) Record and use the proven S_3 formula in the writeup. Under nilpotency and ∑ z_i = 0, it pins down e_3^z = −(z_1 + z_n).
2) Replace the conjectured k = n+2 endpoint identity with the proven one. Note its redundancy under nilpotency + ∑ z_i = 0.
3) Compute e_4(M) via Newton: e_4 = (p_1^4 − 6 p_1^2 p_2 + 3 p_2^2 + 8 p_1 p_3 − 6 p_4)/24. We already have p_1, p_2, p_3; derive p_4 = tr(M^4). This is feasible by closed-walk counting:
   - Diagonal contribution from D^4: ∑ z_i^4.
   - Words with two D’s and two edge moves (one up, one down) give a linear term in z with computable endpoint weights.
   - Pure edge words (four edge moves) contribute a constant depending on endpoints (Dyck vs unrestricted walks); cross-check by small n computations.
   Deliver an explicit formula for p_4, then e_4(M) in terms of e_4^z and boundary linear/quadratic corrections.
4) Impose nilpotency e_4(M) = 0 together with ∑ z_i = 0 and the given boundary linear constraint ∑ i z_i = 0. Aim to derive a contradiction uniformly in n. As a sanity check, carry out the full elimination for n=4 numerically/symbolically to verify inconsistency.
5) Optional structural conjecture: Under ∑ z_i = 0, (M^{n−1+m})_{1n} = (−1)^{n−1} e_m(M) for m = 1,2,3 (verified). Prove this by induction on m. This would explain why endpoint identities align with e_m(M) and prevent redundant steps.

# Summary of improvements
- Proved S_3 exactly via Newton identities: S_3 = ∑_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k + (n−3)∑ z_i + (z_1+z_n).
- Corrected and proved the k = n+2 endpoint identity: (M^{n+2})_{1n} = (−1)^{n−1}(h_3 − [(n+1)∑ z_i − (z_1 + z_n)]). The earlier “−3 φ” conjecture is false (explicit countercheck at n=3); under nilpotency + ∑ z_i = 0 this identity is redundant.
- Recommended pivot: compute p_4 = tr(M^4), then e_4(M), and use e_4(M) = 0 with the boundary linear constraint to force a contradiction for general n. This is a concrete, checkable next step.
