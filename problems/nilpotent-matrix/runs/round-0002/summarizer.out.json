  "summary_md": "This round validated the continuant recurrence and boundary path-count identities and produced closed forms for low-order coefficients and traces. We derived a_{n,1..3}, (M^n)_{n,1}, (M^{n+1})_{n,1} and (M^{n+2})_{n,1} and computed tr(M^2), tr(M^3), tr(M^4) (with tr(A^4)=6n\u221210). The exact identity (M^{n+2})_{n,1}=h_3\u2212(n+1)e_1+(z_1+z_n) gives, under nilpotency (e_1=0), e_3=\u2212(z_1+z_n) and hence z_1+z_n=0. It was shown a_{n,4} contains no weighted term \u2211 i z_i, so a_{n,4}=0 yields no new independent constraint. The n=3 case under the weighted condition was eliminated. Main gap: no current identity decisively uses the weighted constraint \u2211 i z_i=0; next work should develop W-based traces or a kernel/Green approach to exploit it.
