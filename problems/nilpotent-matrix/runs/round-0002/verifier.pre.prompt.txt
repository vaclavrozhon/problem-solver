=== SYSTEM ===
You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md, proofs.md, and output.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers
- notes.md (informal progress & exploratory work so far)
- proofs.md (rigorous proofs & detailed mathematics so far)
- output.md (main results found so far)

**Three-tier file system guidelines**:
- **notes.md**: Readable, log of exploratory work, intuitions, failed attempts, ideas. Prefer appending. Replace only if old notes are clearly misleading. It should be self-contained: In particular, reading it should make sense without knowing the output of provers in past rounds. 

- **proofs.md**: Complete rigorous mathematical proofs with full details. Think twice before adding anything. Contains proven lemmas, theorems, and detailed derivations. Only add mathematically verified content here.
- **output.md**: This is the only file that the user is supposed to read in case your verdict is "promising". It has to be self-contained. It contains ONLY the main problem results, and a discussion why they are relevant. It is extremely selective. Think twice before promoting proofs from proofs.md to output.md. Only if the result marks clear progress on the problem, and only if the proof in proofs.md has been thoroughly vetted by provers and you, it can join output.md. Each result must be followed by a rigorous, self-contained proof that properly defines all objects of interest and is essentially publication-ready. 

Tasks:
1) Audit rigor: identify unjustified steps, false statements, missing lemmas; produce minimal counterexamples.
2) Triage value: separate genuine progress from noise.
3) Guide next steps: propose what provers should try next.

Let M be a tridiagonal matrix with complex numbers z_1, z_2, ..., z_n on diagonal, all entries right below the main diagonal are 1 and all entries right above are -1, e.g.

z_1 -1   0
1    z_2 -1
0   1       z_3

# Tridiagonal nilpotency problem: structural identities and plan

Let M be the n×n tridiagonal matrix with diagonal Z = diag(z_1,…,z_n), ones on the subdiagonal (J), and −1 on the superdiagonal (−U). Thus M = Z + J − U. Define D = diag(1,2,…,n). Then
- [D,J] = J,
- [D,U] = −U,
- e^{−tD} M e^{tD} = Z + e^{−t} J − e^{t} U.
These are useful for similarity-invariant reasoning and path counting.

Basic trace identities (valid for all such M):
- trace(M) = ∑_{i=1}^n z_i.
- trace(M^2) = ∑_{i=1}^n z_i^2 − 2(n−1).
- trace(M^3) = ∑_{i=1}^n z_i^3 − 3(2∑_{i=1}^n z_i − (z_1 + z_n)).
If M were nilpotent, then trace(M^k) = 0 for k ≥ 1, hence ∑ z_i = 0 and ∑ z_i^2 = 2(n−1), etc.

Path-sum identities for the (n,1)-entry of powers (counting words in {J,Z,−U} that map e_1 → e_n while respecting boundaries):
- For k = n: (M^n)_{n,1} = ∑_{i=1}^n z_i. Reason: the only admissible words are those with exactly n−1 copies of J and one Z; the Z can occur at any intermediate index i.
- For k = n+1: (M^{n+1})_{n,1} = ∑_{1≤i≤j≤n} z_i z_j − (n−1). Reason: admissible words have either two Z’s and n−1 J’s (contributing ∑_{i≤j} z_i z_j) or one U and n J’s (there are exactly n−1 valid placements of the U; each contributes −1).
Under ∑ i z_i = 0, the identities for k = n and k = n+1 are compatible with trace(M) = 0 and trace(M^2) = 0 (since c_{n,2} = (n−1) + ∑_{i<j} z_i z_j = 0 is equivalent to ∑ z_i^2 = 2(n−1) when ∑ z_i = 0).

Outlook: To force a contradiction from the extra linear constraint ∑ i z_i = 0, we likely need the next identity (k = n+2). Admissible words now have either three Z’s and n−1 J’s, or one Z, one U, and n J’s. We expect a formula of the form
(M^{n+2})_{n,1} = e_3(z_1,…,z_n) − C_n · (∑_{i=1}^n i z_i),
for some explicit combinatorial constant C_n, obtained by counting valid placements of the single U relative to the single Z along the J-chain. If true, under ∑ i z_i = 0 and nilpotency ((M^{n+2})_{n,1} = 0) we get e_3(z) = 0. In tandem with trace(M^3) = 0 (which reads ∑ z_i^3 + 3(z_1 + z_n) = 0 when ∑ z_i = 0), this yields additional boundary constraints (e.g., z_1 + z_n = 0). Iterating to k = n+3 should overdetermine the system and show nonexistence for n ≥ 2.

Additional identities to verify/extend:
- A convenient constant identity: l^T M u = ∑_{i=1}^n i z_i − (n−1), where l = (1,…,1)^T and u = (1,2,…,n)^T.
- Higher traces: derive exact trace(M^4) (including boundary corrections) using A := J − U. One finds A^2 has diagonal entries −1 at i=1,n and −2 for 2≤i≤n−1, and trace(A^4) counts length-4 closed paths; preliminary count suggests trace(A^4) = 6n − 10 for n ≥ 3 (check carefully for small n and boundary cases). Then trace(M^4) = ∑ z_i^4 + 6∑ z_i^2 (A^2)_{ii} + trace(A^4).

Next steps for provers:
1) Prove rigorously the k = n+2 identity for (M^{n+2})_{n,1} and extract the coefficient of ∑ i z_i.
2) Establish trace(M^4) and c_{n,4} via Faddeev–LeVerrier; compare against the k = n+2 entry identity.
3) Use these to derive an explicit contradiction under ∑ i z_i = 0 and nilpotency.

Remark: The case n = 1 is a trivial nilpotent (z_1 = 0); the statement to be proved should assume n ≥ 2.


Setup and notation
- M = D + L − U with D = diag(z_1,…,z_n), L the lower shift (ones on the subdiagonal), U the upper shift (ones on the superdiagonal).
- W = diag(1,2,…,n). Define J := L + U and S := L − U.

Key identities we will use
- Commutators: [W, M] = L + U; [L, M] = [L, D] + E_{1,1} − E_{n,n}, where [L,D] has entries ([L,D])_{i+1,i} = z_i − z_{i+1}.
- Boundary entries of powers (1 ≤ k ≤ n):
  • (M^k)_{k,1} = ∑_{j=1}^k z_j; and for 0 ≤ k ≤ n−1, (M^k)_{k+1,1} = 1.
  • (M^k)_{n−k+1,n} = (−1)^{k−1} ∑_{j=n−k+1}^n z_j.
- Weighted sum relations:
  • ∑_{i=1}^n i z_i = ∑_{k=1}^n T_k with T_k = ∑_{j=n−k+1}^n z_j = (−1)^{k−1} (M^k)_{n−k+1,n}.
  • ∑_{k=1}^n S_k with S_k = ∑_{j=1}^k z_j equals (n+1)∑ z_i − ∑ i z_i. Hence if tr(M)=∑ z_i=0 (e.g., under nilpotency), then ∑_{k=1}^n S_k = −∑ i z_i = −∑_{k=1}^n (−1)^{k−1} (M^k)_{n−k+1,n}.
- Trace constraints: tr(M^2) = ∑ z_i^2 − 2(n−1); tr(M^3) = ∑ z_i^3 + 3(z_1 + z_n). Under nilpotency these vanish, giving ∑ z_i^2 = 2(n−1), ∑ z_i^3 = −3(z_1 + z_n).
- Additional continuant/coefficients facts (to be formalized): the λ^{n−3} coefficient identity implies e_3 = −(z_1 + z_n) when e_1=0; this matches tr(M^3).

Checked case and corrections
- n = 3: a direct coefficient analysis shows the weighted constraint is incompatible with nilpotency (see proofs.md for a complete argument).
- Correction: the equality ∑ i z_i = ∑_{k=1}^n S_k is false in general; it holds up to a sign only when ∑ z_i = 0. The right-edge identity ∑ i z_i = ∑_{k=1}^n T_k is exact.
- The claim that all principal cofactors C_{ii}(0) vanish under Δ_n(λ)=λ^n is false; do not use Δ_{i−1}(0) Δ^{(i+1)}_{n−i}(0) = 0.

Next steps
- Compute tr(M^4) and optionally tr(M^5) explicitly; combine with the commutator identities 0 = tr([L,M] M^{k−1}) for k=1,… to obtain additional independent constraints.
- Derive the λ^{n−4} coefficient in closed form via matchings and combine with e_1=0, e_2=−(n−1), e_3=−(z_1+z_n) and ∑ i z_i=0.
- Prototype an edge-peeling induction (e.g., eliminate z_1, z_n via the two linear equations and analyze a reduced tridiagonal system) and test it for n=4,5.


Added progress and corrections summary.

- We verified the continuant recurrence for P_k(λ) = det(λ I − M_{[k]}): P_k = (λ − z_k) P_{k−1} + P_{k−2}, with P_0 = 1, P_1 = λ − z_1. From this we confirmed:
  • a_{k,1} = −∑_{j ≤ k} z_j.
  • a_{k,2} = ∑_{1≤i<j≤k} z_i z_j + (k − 1).
  • a_{k,3} = −∑_{1≤i<j<ℓ≤k} z_i z_j z_ℓ − (k − 3)∑_{j ≤ k} z_j − (z_1 + z_k).
- Low-order traces: tr(M^2) = ∑ z_i^2 − 2(n − 1), tr(M^3) = ∑ z_i^3 − 6∑ z_i + 3(z_1 + z_n).
- Under nilpotency (M^n = 0): a_{n,1} = a_{n,2} = a_{n,3} = 0 ⇒ ∑ z_i = 0, ∑_{i<j} z_i z_j = −(n − 1), ∑_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k = −(z_1 + z_n). Also tr(M^2) = tr(M^3) = 0. Using α_{n+2} (see below) in fact enforces z_1 + z_n = 0 and hence E_3 = 0.
- Path counting (boundary-to-boundary entries): α_{n−1} = 1, α_n = ∑ z_i, α_{n+1} = ∑_{i≤j} z_i z_j − (n − 1), α_{n+2} = ∑_{i≤j≤k} z_i z_j z_k − (n − 1)∑ z_i. With S = ∑ z_i = 0, α_{n+2} = h_3 = (2/3)∑ z_i^3 − E_3. Since tr(M^3) = 0 gives ∑ z_i^3 + 3E_3 = 0, we get α_{n+2} = −3E_3. Nilpotency implies α_{n+2} = 0 ⇒ E_3 = 0 ⇒ z_1 + z_n = 0. (This corrects a factor-3 slip in an earlier note.)
- New explicit formulas:
  • Fourth coefficient: a_{n,4} = E_4 + (n − 5) E_2 + [∑_{j=1}^{n−1} z_j z_{j+1}] − (z_1^2 + z_n^2) + (n − 3)(n − 2)/2. In particular, there is no ∑ k z_k term.
  • tr(M^4) = ∑ z_i^4 − 8∑ z_i^2 + 4(z_1^2 + z_n^2) − 4∑_{j=1}^{n−1} z_j z_{j+1} + (6n − 10).
  Under nilpotency, tr(M^2) = tr(M^4) = 0.
- Observation: Newton identities show a_{n,4} is determined by tr(M^2), tr(M^4). Thus a_{n,4} = 0 brings no new constraint beyond tr(M^2) = tr(M^4) = 0 when M is nilpotent.
- Critical gap: None of the current identities truly use the weighted constraint ∑ k z_k = 0. Coefficients/traces and α_{n+q} depend on symmetric sums and boundary effects (z_1, z_n) and adjacent products, but we do not see an index-weighted linear term emerge. We need identities explicitly involving J = diag(1,2,…,n). Candidates: tr(J M^r) expansions, and a kernel-vector approach for M v = 0 combined with discrete summation by parts and ∑ k z_k = 0.

# Focused critique and rigorous additions

This round addresses correctness, clarity, and the missing use of the weighted constraint. I point out concrete issues in the notes, supply fully rigorous lemmas (with proofs), and propose auditable next steps that directly involve the weight operator W = diag(1,…,n).


Corrections and gaps to fix now

- h₃ vs e₃ vs p₃ confusion: For variables z = (z₁,…,zₙ), one has h₃ = e₁³ − 2e₁e₂ + e₃. In particular, if e₁ = ∑ zᵢ = 0, then h₃ = e₃. The earlier claim “h₃ = (2/3)∑ zᵢ³ − E₃” is incorrect. This must be corrected wherever used.
- α_{n+2} factor: The correct path-classification for α_{n+2} := (M^{n+2})_{n,1} gives α_{n+2} = h₃(z) − (n−1)∑ zᵢ (proof below). Under ∑ zᵢ=0, α_{n+2}=h₃=e₃. Thus α_{n+2}=0 forces e₃=0, and together with a_{n,3}=0 (which reads e₃ = −(z₁+zₙ) when e₁=0) one concludes z₁+zₙ=0. The “−3” factor appearing in prior notes is erroneous.
- tr(M³): The general identity is tr(M³) = ∑ zᵢ³ − 6∑ zᵢ + 3(z₁+zₙ). The shortened form tr(M³)=∑ zᵢ³ + 3(z₁+zₙ) holds only when ∑ zᵢ=0. Please standardize statements accordingly.
- Weighted condition usage: So far, the weight ∑ i zᵢ has only been repackaged (e.g., as tr(WM) or as sums of boundary entries), but not exploited to force a contradiction beyond what nilpotency already gives. We need identities where W enters essentially.


Rigorous lemmas and proofs to add

Notation: M = D + L − U with D = diag(z₁,…,zₙ), L the lower shift, U the upper shift. Let W = diag(1,…,n).

1) Commutator identities (for reference)
- [W, M] = L + U.
- [L, M] = [L, D] + E_{1,1} − E_{n,n}, with ([L, D])_{i+1,i} = zᵢ − z_{i+1}.
Proofs are standard and already essentially present; keep them in proofs.md.

2) Boundary entries of powers (left and right edges)
- For 1 ≤ k ≤ n: (M^k)_{k,1} = ∑_{j=1}^k z_j and, for 0 ≤ k ≤ n−1, (M^k)_{k+1,1} = 1.
- For 1 ≤ k ≤ n: (M^k)_{n−k+1,n} = (−1)^{k−1} ∑_{j=n−k+1}^n z_j.
Proof (sketch). Enumerate paths on the chain graph from column 1 to row k (resp. n) in k steps using D,L,U moves. Minimal-length constraints force exactly one D and no U for the left edge case, and exactly one D and no L for the right edge; signs for U’s are (−1) per U. Details as in prior round; formalize in proofs.md.

3) Weighted-sum reformulations
- tr(WM) = ∑ i zᵢ (since tr(WL)=tr(WU)=0). So the weighted constraint is exactly tr(WM) = 0.
- ∑_{k=1}^n (M^k)_{k,1} = ∑_{k=1}^n ∑_{j=1}^k z_j = (n+1)∑ zᵢ − ∑ i zᵢ. Hence if ∑ zᵢ = 0 (true for nilpotent M), the constraint ∑ i zᵢ = 0 is equivalent to ∑_{k=1}^n (M^k)_{k,1} = 0.
- Also ∑ i zᵢ = ∑_{k=1}^n T_k with T_k := ∑_{j=n−k+1}^n z_j = (−1)^{k−1}(M^k)_{n−k+1,n} (exact, no need to assume ∑ zᵢ=0).
These identities place the weighted constraint squarely into sums of specific boundary entries of powers.

4) Exact formula for α_{n+2} with proof
Let α_m := (M^m)_{n,1}. For m = n+2 there are two path-types from 1 to n in m steps:
- Type A: d = 3 diagonal steps, u = 0 up-steps, ℓ = n−1 down-steps; weight = product of the 3 diagonal z’s; summing over all placements yields h₃(z).
- Type B: d = 1 diagonal, u = 1 up-step, ℓ = n down-steps; weight = (−1)·z_i for the unique z_i chosen. The number of valid placements of the single U among the n L’s, subject to the path staying within the chain constraints, is exactly n−1 (U cannot occur before the first L nor after the last L, otherwise the path exits the 1..n strip). Thus the total contribution is −(n−1)∑ zᵢ.
Therefore
α_{n+2} = h₃(z) − (n−1)∑ zᵢ.
In particular, if ∑ zᵢ = 0, then α_{n+2} = h₃ = e₃.

5) Consequence: z₁ + zₙ = 0 under nilpotency
If M is nilpotent then α_{n+2} = 0 and ∑ zᵢ = 0, hence e₃ = 0. On the other hand, the previously verified coefficient identity a_{n,3} = 0 reads (with e₁=0)
0 = a_{n,3} = −e₃ − (z₁ + zₙ).
Thus e₃ = 0 implies z₁ + zₙ = 0. This step is sound and should replace the factor-3 argument in notes.

6) A weighted trace identity for M²
tr(WM²) = ∑_{i=1}^n i z_i^2 − (n² − 1).
Proof. Expand M² = D² + (DL + LD) − (DU + UD) + (L² + U²) − (LU + UL). Since L,U have zero diagonal, tr(WDL)=tr(WLD)=tr(WDU)=tr(WUD)=tr(WL²)=tr(WU²)=0. We have (LU)_{ii}=1 for 2≤i≤n and (UL)_{ii}=1 for 1≤i≤n−1. Hence tr(W LU) = ∑_{i=2}^n i and tr(W UL) = ∑_{i=1}^{n−1} i, so tr(W(LU+UL)) = n² − 1. The claim follows.
Remark. This shows tr(WM²) is completely explicit. While it doesn’t by itself contradict nilpotency or ∑ i zᵢ = 0, it is a reusable identity that couples W and the z’s quadratically.

7) Kernel summation-by-parts identity (weighted)
Let 0 ≠ v ∈ ker M with boundary v₀ = v_{n+1} = 0 and recurrence v_{i+1} = z_i v_i + v_{i−1}. Then
∑_{i=1}^n i z_i v_i^2 = − ∑_{i=1}^{n−1} v_i v_{i+1}.
Proof. Multiply v_{i+1} − z_i v_i − v_{i−1} = 0 by i v_i and sum i=1..n. The cross terms telescope to −∑_{i=1}^{n−1} v_i v_{i+1} using v₀ = v_{n+1} = 0 as in the analysis. This identity is new in the notes and precisely exhibits how the weighted functional interacts with a kernel vector.
Comments. On its own this does not contradict ∑ i zᵢ = 0, but it is a promising bridge to combine with other constraints (e.g., ∑ z_i v_i^2 = 0 from the unweighted pairing) and with explicit structure of v coming from the transfer recurrences.


Where the current writeup needs tightening

- Provide the full proof of item (4): α_{n+2} = h₃ − (n−1)∑ zᵢ. The path classification is simple, but the admissibility count (n−1 for the single U) must be justified carefully (e.g., via a bijection between valid placements and the n−1 interior edges of the path graph).
- Unify all uses of tr(M³) under one general identity and then state the nilpotent corollary as a separate line; currently both forms appear and may confuse the reader.
- Explicitly record the equivalence ∑ i zᵢ = 0 ⇔ tr(WM)=0, and under ∑ zᵢ=0 the equivalent form ∑_{k=1}^n (M^k)_{k,1} = 0. These translations matter when we try to craft weighted commutator arguments.
- Remove or correct the incorrect “h₃ = (2/3)∑ zᵢ³ − e₃” and the “α_{n+2} = −3 e₃” claims. Replace them with the clean chain: α_{n+2}=h₃−(n−1)∑ zᵢ; with ∑ zᵢ=0 this is α_{n+2}=e₃; under nilpotency α_{n+2}=0 so e₃=0; then a_{n,3}=0 gives z₁+zₙ=0.


Ideas to leverage the weighted constraint going forward

- W-traces: We now have tr(WM)=0 (the weighted condition) and an explicit tr(WM²). It is feasible to compute tr(WM³) explicitly (though more involved since cyclicity doesn’t neutralize W). These give concrete equations involving weighted power sums of z and short “edge” corrections. Combining tr(M^k)=0 and tr(WM^k) identities for k=1,2,3 may overdetermine z₁ and zₙ in terms of the interior, possibly enabling an induction.
- Kernel method: The two identities ∑ z_i v_i^2 = 0 and ∑ i z_i v_i^2 = −∑ v_i v_{i+1}, together with the Riccati variables w_{i+1} = z_i + 1/w_i (from v_{i+1}/v_i = z_i + 1/w_i), give a closed system whose weighted sums can be tracked. With z₁+zₙ=0 already forced by α_{n+2}, this method may yield a contradiction (e.g., by showing ∑ i z_i v_i^2 ≠ 0 unless z ≡ 0, which is impossible by e₂ = −(n−1)).
- Edge-peeling induction: With z₁+zₙ=0, re-express e₂, e₃, and a_{n,4} in terms of the middle block z₂,…,z_{n−1} and z₁. Investigate whether P_n(λ) factors as λ²P_{n−2}(λ) plus a term that is incompatible with P_n(λ)=λⁿ under the two linear relations e₁=0, ∑ i zᵢ=0. A block-determinant approach (eliminating the 1st and nth rows/columns) may show that nilpotency of M forces nilpotency of the middle (n−2)×(n−2) tridiagonal with an inherited weighted relation, enabling induction. This is precise and checkable.


Obstacles (why some routes fail)

- Coefficients and boundary entries α_{n+q} alone do not produce index-weighted terms; they depend on symmetric polynomials and small boundary corrections (z₁,zₙ), not on ∑ i zᵢ. Hence pushing α_{n+q} without W will not incorporate the weighted constraint.
- Inequalities (e.g., positivity) are unavailable: zᵢ ∈ ℂ, so Cauchy–Schwarz-type obstructions for the weighted sums do not apply.


Next steps (auditable and targeted)

1) Formalize and include in proofs.md the exact α_{n+2} identity with full combinatorial proof and a short note deducing z₁+zₙ=0 from nilpotency.
2) Compute tr(WM³) explicitly. With tr(M)=0, tr(M²)=0, tr(M³)=0 and tr(WM)=0, tr(WM²) known, and tr(WM³) (to be computed), attempt to solve for z₁ and zₙ in terms of interior z’s, then show incompatibility with e₂ = −(n−1) and e₃ = 0.
3) Develop the block-determinant (Schur complement) reduction eliminating indices 1 and n. Make precise what weighted relation the (n−2) middle block inherits from ∑ i zᵢ=0 and e₁=0, and prove an induction step (if the middle block were nilpotent under its inherited constraint, then so would M be; contrapositive yields the desired impossibility).
4) Document the kernel weighted identity (item 7) and explore whether combining it with ∑ z_i v_i^2 = 0 and z₁+zₙ=0 already forces constraints on v (e.g., via a short computation for n=4,5) that contradict e₂=−(n−1).

These items directly address the principal gap: bringing the weighted condition into identities that interact with nilpotency in a nontrivial way, while cleaning up the existing derivations for correctness and future reuse.

# Ideas

- Derive an exact, checkable formula for the boundary entry (M^{n+2})_{n,1} by path enumeration. This clarifies which linear combinations of the z_i occur and corrects the earlier hypothesis that a weighted sum ∑ i z_i would appear at k = n+2.
- Compute tr(A^4) for A := L − U and then tr(M^4) exactly in terms of z_i and nearest-neighbor products. This supplies a new necessary identity under nilpotence (tr(M^4)=0) that couples quartic, quadratic, and adjacent products of the z_i.
- Push the matchings/continuant method one order further to give an explicit formula for the λ^{n−4} coefficient c_{n−4} in det(λI−M). Setting c_{n−4}=0 under nilpotence yields a new algebraic constraint involving e_4, e_2, nearest-neighbor sums, and boundary corrections.

# Notation

- M = Z + L − U, with Z = diag(z_1,…,z_n), L the subdiagonal shift (ones on (i+1,i)), U the superdiagonal shift (ones on (i,i+1)). Let A := L − U.
- e_k are the elementary symmetric polynomials in z_1,…,z_n; h_k are the complete homogeneous ones. Recall h_1 = e_1, h_2 = e_1^2 − e_2, h_3 = e_1^3 − 2 e_1 e_2 + e_3.

# Proposition 1 (Exact formula for (M^{n+2})_{n,1})

Claim. For all n ≥ 2,
(M^{n+2})_{n,1} = h_3(z_1,…,z_n) − (n+1) e_1(z) + (z_1 + z_n).

Proof (combinatorial path count).
View (M^k)_{n,1} as the sum of weights of length-k words in the alphabet {L, −U, Z}, acting on index positions {1,…,n}, that send 1 to n while respecting the boundary. Here L increases the index by +1 with weight +1, U decreases by −1 with weight −1 (because of the − sign in M), and Z keeps the index fixed with weight z_{current}.

For k = n+2, the net displacement must be n−1, hence if s is the number of Z’s and r the number of U’s, then the system
- r + ℓ + s = n+2,
- ℓ − r = n−1,
forces r = (3 − s)/2, so s is odd and s ∈ {1,3}. Thus two disjoint classes of words contribute:

1) s = 3, r = 0, ℓ = n−1: no U, n−1 copies of L, and three Z’s. The path visits indices 1,2,…,n monotonically; inserting three Z’s at visited vertices produces exactly h_3(z). Contribution: h_3.

2) s = 1, r = 1, ℓ = n: one Z, one U, and n copies of L. Validity exactly requires the unique U not to be the first step (to avoid leaving the path at 0) and not the last (to avoid overshooting n+1 before the U occurs). There are n−1 valid U-positions t ∈ {2,…,n} in the word of L/U steps. For a fixed U-position t, the index trajectory along the L/U steps is
1,2,3,…,t−1, t, t−1, t, t+1,…,n,
and the coefficient of z_j from this t is the number of visits to level j in this trajectory. Summing over t = 2,…,n gives the total coefficient c_j of z_j in the “one-U-one-Z” contribution. A direct count yields
- c_1 = n, c_n = n,
- c_j = n+1 for 2 ≤ j ≤ n−1.
Therefore the total “one-U-one-Z” contribution equals −∑_{j=1}^n c_j z_j = −[n z_1 + (n+1)∑_{j=2}^{n−1} z_j + n z_n] = −[(n+1) e_1 − (z_1 + z_n)].

Combining the two classes proves the formula. ∎

Corollary (consistency with nilpotence). Under nilpotence, e_1 = 0 and M^{n+2} = 0, hence (M^{n+2})_{n,1} = 0. Using h_3 = e_3 when e_1=0, the proposition reduces to e_3 + (z_1 + z_n) = 0, which matches the known λ^{n−3} coefficient identity and tr(M^3)=0 (Newton identities). Thus the k = n+2 boundary identity yields no new information beyond e_3 = −(z_1 + z_n).

Remark. This corrects the earlier speculation that (M^{n+2})_{n,1} would feature the weighted sum ∑ i z_i; it does not.

# Lemma 2 (tr(A^4) = 6n−10)

Let A = L − U. Then A^2 has diagonal entries −1 at i ∈ {1,n} and −2 for 2 ≤ i ≤ n−1, and ones on the second sub/super-diagonals; all other entries zero. Therefore
tr(A^4) = ∑_{i,j} (A^2)_{i,j}^2 = [1^2 + 1^2 + 4(n−2)] + 2(n−2) = 6n − 10.
This holds for all n ≥ 2. ∎

# Proposition 3 (Exact formula for tr(M^4))

For M = Z + A with A = L − U,
tr(M^4) = ∑_{i=1}^n z_i^4 − 4 z_1^2 − 8∑_{i=2}^{n−1} z_i^2 − 4 z_n^2 − 4 ∑_{i=1}^{n−1} z_i z_{i+1} + (6n − 10).

Proof.
Expand M^4 = (Z + A)^4 and use cyclicity of trace. Terms with an odd number of A’s have zero trace: for tr(Z^3 A) and tr(Z A^3) the diagonal of the odd power of A vanishes; likewise any cyclic variant. The 2-A terms reduce, up to cyclic equivalence, to two copies each of tr(Z^2 A^2), tr(Z A Z A), tr(Z A^2 Z). Since Z is diagonal, tr(Z^2 A^2) = tr(Z A^2 Z) = ∑ z_i^2 (A^2)_{i,i} = −z_1^2 − 2∑_{i=2}^{n−1} z_i^2 − z_n^2, and a direct 2×2 computation on neighbors gives tr(Z A Z A) = −2∑_{i=1}^{n−1} z_i z_{i+1}. Finally, add tr(Z^4) and tr(A^4) from Lemma 2. ∎

Consequence under nilpotence. Since tr(M^k) = 0 for all k ≥ 1, we obtain two constraints:
- tr(M^2) = 0 ⇒ ∑ z_i^2 = 2(n−1),
- tr(M^4) = 0 ⇒ ∑ z_i^4 − 4 z_1^2 − 8∑_{i=2}^{n−1} z_i^2 − 4 z_n^2 − 4 ∑_{i=1}^{n−1} z_i z_{i+1} + (6n − 10) = 0.
These are independent of the weighted condition and will be used together with it in subsequent steps.

# Proposition 4 (Explicit λ^{n−4} coefficient via matchings)

Write Δ_n(λ) = det(λ I − M). Then
Coefficient[λ^{n−4}] = c_{n−4} = e_4 + Q + m_2,
where m_2 = C(n−2,2) is the number of 2-edge matchings in P_n, and
Q = ∑_{edges e} ∑_{i<j, i,j ∉ V(e)} z_i z_j = ∑_{i<j} c(i,j) z_i z_j,
with explicit edge-avoidance multiplicities c(i,j):
- If |i−j| ≥ 2 (nonadjacent), c(i,j) = (n−1) − deg(i) − deg(j), i.e., n−5 if both interior, n−4 if one endpoint is a boundary vertex and the other is interior, and n−3 if {i,j} = {1,n}.
- If j = i+1 (adjacent), c(i,i+1) = (n−1) − (deg(i) + deg(i+1) − 1), i.e., n−4 if 2 ≤ i ≤ n−2, and n−3 if i ∈ {1, n−1}.
Equivalently, grouping by structures,
Q = (n−5) (e_2 − A) + [(n−3)(z_1 z_2 + z_{n−1} z_n) + (n−4) ∑_{i=2}^{n−2} z_i z_{i+1}] + [z_1 ∑_{j=3}^n z_j + z_n ∑_{i=1}^{n−2} z_i],
where A = ∑_{i=1}^{n−1} z_i z_{i+1}.

Proof.
By the standard continuant/matching expansion for tridiagonal determinants (with the signless edge weight here, since in λI−M the off-diagonal products contribute +1), the λ^{n−4} term receives contributions from matchings of size m with n−2m ≥ n−4 ⇒ m ∈ {0,1,2}. For m=0 we get e_4. For m=1, we must pick two z’s among the unmatched vertices; for each pair {i,j} this is allowed by all edges e that avoid i and j, counted by c(i,j) as stated (deg(1)=deg(n)=1, others 2). For m=2, all unmatched vertices are taken as λ, giving +1 per 2-edge matching, i.e., C(n−2,2). The regrouping identity for Q follows by separating adjacent vs. nonadjacent pairs and compensating boundary cases explicitly. ∎

Corollary under nilpotence. If M is nilpotent then c_{n−4} = 0. Together with
- e_1 = 0 (coefficient of λ^{n−1}),
- e_2 = −(n−1) (coefficient of λ^{n−2}),
- e_3 = −(z_1 + z_n) (coefficient of λ^{n−3}),
this yields a concrete algebraic relation among e_4, nearest-neighbor sums A, and boundary terms z_1,z_2,z_{n−1},z_n. This is a new independent constraint to combine with trace(M^4)=0 and the weighted condition ∑ i z_i = 0 in the next step.

# Examples/checks

- For n=3, Proposition 1 gives (M^5)_{3,1} = h_3 − 4 e_1 + (z_1 + z_3). Under e_1=0, this equals e_3 + (z_1 + z_3), coherent with e_3 = −(z_1 + z_3).
- For n≥2, Lemma 2 yields tr(A^4) = 6n−10. Direct computation for n=2 gives tr(A^4)=2, matching 6·2−10.

# Obstacles and corrections

- The earlier heuristic that (M^{n+2})_{n,1} would directly involve ∑ i z_i is false. The exact formula shows dependence only on h_3 and the unweighted sum e_1 with end correction (z_1+z_n).
- The λ^{n−4} coefficient bookkeeping is delicate near the boundary; the explicit c(i,j) coefficients above account for all such cases cleanly.

# Next steps

- Use c_{n−4}=0 with e_1=0, e_2=−(n−1), e_3=−(z_1+z_n) to solve for e_4 and A = ∑ z_i z_{i+1} in terms of boundary variables, then combine with tr(M^4)=0 to eliminate e_4 and A, producing a relation solely among z_1,z_2,z_{n−1},z_n. Test whether this, together with the weighted condition ∑ i z_i = 0, forces z_1=z_n=0 and peel the ends (induction).
- Derive analogous explicit formulas for (M^{n+3})_{n,1}. The one-U occupancy becomes triangular-number–like for two U’s (s=0) and mixed terms for s=2; these should produce nonuniform linear coefficients in z_j that better correlate with the weight vector (1,2,…,n). If successful, the vanishing of (M^{n+3})_{n,1} under nilpotence may interact directly with ∑ i z_i = 0.
- Leverage the commutator identity 0 = tr([L,M] M^{k−1}) = (M^{k−1})_{11} − (M^{k−1})_{nn} + ∑_{i=1}^{n−1} (z_i − z_{i+1}) (M^{k−1})_{i,i+1} to connect nearest-neighbor products and boundary values. Evaluate explicitly for k=2,3,4 under nilpotence to get additional linear relations.

# Summary of new, reusable results

- Exact boundary identity: (M^{n+2})_{n,1} = h_3 − (n+1) e_1 + (z_1 + z_n); under nilpotence (e_1=0) this reduces to e_3 = −(z_1+z_n).
- tr(A^4) = 6n − 10 for A = L − U.
- tr(M^4) = ∑ z_i^4 − 4 z_1^2 − 8∑_{i=2}^{n−1} z_i^2 − 4 z_n^2 − 4 ∑_{i=1}^{n−1} z_i z_{i+1} + 6n − 10.
- Explicit λ^{n−4} coefficient c_{n−4} in terms of e_4, e_2, nearest-neighbor sums, boundary corrections, and C(n−2,2). These constraints are all rigorously derived and ready to be combined with the weighted condition to seek a contradiction inductively.
