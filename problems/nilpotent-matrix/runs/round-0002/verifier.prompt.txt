=== SYSTEM ===
You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md, proofs.md, and output.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers
- notes.md (informal progress & exploratory work so far)
- proofs.md (rigorous proofs & detailed mathematics so far)
- output.md (main results found so far)

**Three-tier file system guidelines**:
- **notes.md**: Readable, log of exploratory work, intuitions, failed attempts, ideas. Prefer appending. Replace only if old notes are clearly misleading. It should be self-contained: In particular, reading it should make sense without knowing the output of provers in past rounds. 

- **proofs.md**: Complete rigorous mathematical proofs with full details. Think twice before adding anything. Contains proven lemmas, theorems, and detailed derivations. Only add mathematically verified content here.
- **output.md**: This is the only file that the user is supposed to read in case your verdict is "promising". It has to be self-contained. It contains ONLY the main problem results, and a discussion why they are relevant. It is extremely selective. Think twice before promoting proofs from proofs.md to output.md. Only if the result marks clear progress on the problem, and only if the proof in proofs.md has been thoroughly vetted by provers and you, it can join output.md. Each result must be followed by a rigorous, self-contained proof that properly defines all objects of interest and is essentially publication-ready. 

Tasks:
1) Audit rigor: identify unjustified steps, false statements, missing lemmas; produce minimal counterexamples.
2) Triage value: separate genuine progress from noise.
3) Guide next steps: propose what provers should try next.

Let M be a tridiagonal matrix with complex numbers z_1, z_2, ..., z_n on diagonal, all entries right below the main diagonal are 1 and all entries right above are -1, e.g.

z_1 -1   0
1    z_2 -1
0   1       z_3

Furthermore, the numbers on diagonal satisfy linear condition
z_1 + 2 z_2 + 3z_3 + ... n z_n =0.

# Tridiagonal nilpotency problem: structural identities and plan

Let M be the n×n tridiagonal matrix with diagonal Z = diag(z_1,…,z_n), ones on the subdiagonal (J), and −1 on the superdiagonal (−U). Thus M = Z + J − U. Define D = diag(1,2,…,n). Then
- [D,J] = J,
- [D,U] = −U,
- e^{−tD} M e^{tD} = Z + e^{−t} J − e^{t} U.
These are useful for similarity-invariant reasoning and path counting.

Basic trace identities (valid for all such M):
- trace(M) = ∑_{i=1}^n z_i.
- trace(M^2) = ∑_{i=1}^n z_i^2 − 2(n−1).
- trace(M^3) = ∑_{i=1}^n z_i^3 − 3(2∑_{i=1}^n z_i − (z_1 + z_n)).
If M were nilpotent, then trace(M^k) = 0 for k ≥ 1, hence ∑ z_i = 0 and ∑ z_i^2 = 2(n−1), etc.

Path-sum identities for the (n,1)-entry of powers (counting words in {J,Z,−U} that map e_1 → e_n while respecting boundaries):
- For k = n: (M^n)_{n,1} = ∑_{i=1}^n z_i. Reason: the only admissible words are those with exactly n−1 copies of J and one Z; the Z can occur at any intermediate index i.
- For k = n+1: (M^{n+1})_{n,1} = ∑_{1≤i≤j≤n} z_i z_j − (n−1). Reason: admissible words have either two Z’s and n−1 J’s (contributing ∑_{i≤j} z_i z_j) or one U and n J’s (there are exactly n−1 valid placements of the U; each contributes −1).
Under ∑ i z_i = 0, the identities for k = n and k = n+1 are compatible with trace(M) = 0 and trace(M^2) = 0 (since c_{n,2} = (n−1) + ∑_{i<j} z_i z_j = 0 is equivalent to ∑ z_i^2 = 2(n−1) when ∑ z_i = 0).

Outlook: To force a contradiction from the extra linear constraint ∑ i z_i = 0, we likely need the next identity (k = n+2). Admissible words now have either three Z’s and n−1 J’s, or one Z, one U, and n J’s. We expect a formula of the form
(M^{n+2})_{n,1} = e_3(z_1,…,z_n) − C_n · (∑_{i=1}^n i z_i),
for some explicit combinatorial constant C_n, obtained by counting valid placements of the single U relative to the single Z along the J-chain. If true, under ∑ i z_i = 0 and nilpotency ((M^{n+2})_{n,1} = 0) we get e_3(z) = 0. In tandem with trace(M^3) = 0 (which reads ∑ z_i^3 + 3(z_1 + z_n) = 0 when ∑ z_i = 0), this yields additional boundary constraints (e.g., z_1 + z_n = 0). Iterating to k = n+3 should overdetermine the system and show nonexistence for n ≥ 2.

Additional identities to verify/extend:
- A convenient constant identity: l^T M u = ∑_{i=1}^n i z_i − (n−1), where l = (1,…,1)^T and u = (1,2,…,n)^T.
- Higher traces: derive exact trace(M^4) (including boundary corrections) using A := J − U. One finds A^2 has diagonal entries −1 at i=1,n and −2 for 2≤i≤n−1, and trace(A^4) counts length-4 closed paths; preliminary count suggests trace(A^4) = 6n − 10 for n ≥ 3 (check carefully for small n and boundary cases). Then trace(M^4) = ∑ z_i^4 + 6∑ z_i^2 (A^2)_{ii} + trace(A^4).

Next steps for provers:
1) Prove rigorously the k = n+2 identity for (M^{n+2})_{n,1} and extract the coefficient of ∑ i z_i.
2) Establish trace(M^4) and c_{n,4} via Faddeev–LeVerrier; compare against the k = n+2 entry identity.
3) Use these to derive an explicit contradiction under ∑ i z_i = 0 and nilpotency.

Remark: The case n = 1 is a trivial nilpotent (z_1 = 0); the statement to be proved should assume n ≥ 2.


Setup and notation
- M = D + L − U with D = diag(z_1,…,z_n), L the lower shift (ones on the subdiagonal), U the upper shift (ones on the superdiagonal).
- W = diag(1,2,…,n). Define J := L + U and S := L − U.

Key identities we will use
- Commutators: [W, M] = L + U; [L, M] = [L, D] + E_{1,1} − E_{n,n}, where [L,D] has entries ([L,D])_{i+1,i} = z_i − z_{i+1}.
- Boundary entries of powers (1 ≤ k ≤ n):
  • (M^k)_{k,1} = ∑_{j=1}^k z_j; and for 0 ≤ k ≤ n−1, (M^k)_{k+1,1} = 1.
  • (M^k)_{n−k+1,n} = (−1)^{k−1} ∑_{j=n−k+1}^n z_j.
- Weighted sum relations:
  • ∑_{i=1}^n i z_i = ∑_{k=1}^n T_k with T_k = ∑_{j=n−k+1}^n z_j = (−1)^{k−1} (M^k)_{n−k+1,n}.
  • ∑_{k=1}^n S_k with S_k = ∑_{j=1}^k z_j equals (n+1)∑ z_i − ∑ i z_i. Hence if tr(M)=∑ z_i=0 (e.g., under nilpotency), then ∑_{k=1}^n S_k = −∑ i z_i = −∑_{k=1}^n (−1)^{k−1} (M^k)_{n−k+1,n}.
- Trace constraints: tr(M^2) = ∑ z_i^2 − 2(n−1); tr(M^3) = ∑ z_i^3 + 3(z_1 + z_n). Under nilpotency these vanish, giving ∑ z_i^2 = 2(n−1), ∑ z_i^3 = −3(z_1 + z_n).
- Additional continuant/coefficients facts (to be formalized): the λ^{n−3} coefficient identity implies e_3 = −(z_1 + z_n) when e_1=0; this matches tr(M^3).

Checked case and corrections
- n = 3: a direct coefficient analysis shows the weighted constraint is incompatible with nilpotency (see proofs.md for a complete argument).
- Correction: the equality ∑ i z_i = ∑_{k=1}^n S_k is false in general; it holds up to a sign only when ∑ z_i = 0. The right-edge identity ∑ i z_i = ∑_{k=1}^n T_k is exact.
- The claim that all principal cofactors C_{ii}(0) vanish under Δ_n(λ)=λ^n is false; do not use Δ_{i−1}(0) Δ^{(i+1)}_{n−i}(0) = 0.

Next steps
- Compute tr(M^4) and optionally tr(M^5) explicitly; combine with the commutator identities 0 = tr([L,M] M^{k−1}) for k=1,… to obtain additional independent constraints.
- Derive the λ^{n−4} coefficient in closed form via matchings and combine with e_1=0, e_2=−(n−1), e_3=−(z_1+z_n) and ∑ i z_i=0.
- Prototype an edge-peeling induction (e.g., eliminate z_1, z_n via the two linear equations and analyze a reduced tridiagonal system) and test it for n=4,5.


Added progress and corrections summary.

- We verified the continuant recurrence for P_k(λ) = det(λ I − M_{[k]}): P_k = (λ − z_k) P_{k−1} + P_{k−2}, with P_0 = 1, P_1 = λ − z_1. From this we confirmed:
  • a_{k,1} = −∑_{j ≤ k} z_j.
  • a_{k,2} = ∑_{1≤i<j≤k} z_i z_j + (k − 1).
  • a_{k,3} = −∑_{1≤i<j<ℓ≤k} z_i z_j z_ℓ − (k − 3)∑_{j ≤ k} z_j − (z_1 + z_k).
- Low-order traces: tr(M^2) = ∑ z_i^2 − 2(n − 1), tr(M^3) = ∑ z_i^3 − 6∑ z_i + 3(z_1 + z_n).
- Under nilpotency (M^n = 0): a_{n,1} = a_{n,2} = a_{n,3} = 0 ⇒ ∑ z_i = 0, ∑_{i<j} z_i z_j = −(n − 1), ∑_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k = −(z_1 + z_n). Also tr(M^2) = tr(M^3) = 0. Using α_{n+2} (see below) in fact enforces z_1 + z_n = 0 and hence E_3 = 0.
- Path counting (boundary-to-boundary entries): α_{n−1} = 1, α_n = ∑ z_i, α_{n+1} = ∑_{i≤j} z_i z_j − (n − 1), α_{n+2} = ∑_{i≤j≤k} z_i z_j z_k − (n − 1)∑ z_i. With S = ∑ z_i = 0, α_{n+2} = h_3 = (2/3)∑ z_i^3 − E_3. Since tr(M^3) = 0 gives ∑ z_i^3 + 3E_3 = 0, we get α_{n+2} = −3E_3. Nilpotency implies α_{n+2} = 0 ⇒ E_3 = 0 ⇒ z_1 + z_n = 0. (This corrects a factor-3 slip in an earlier note.)
- New explicit formulas:
  • Fourth coefficient: a_{n,4} = E_4 + (n − 5) E_2 + [∑_{j=1}^{n−1} z_j z_{j+1}] − (z_1^2 + z_n^2) + (n − 3)(n − 2)/2. In particular, there is no ∑ k z_k term.
  • tr(M^4) = ∑ z_i^4 − 8∑ z_i^2 + 4(z_1^2 + z_n^2) − 4∑_{j=1}^{n−1} z_j z_{j+1} + (6n − 10).
  Under nilpotency, tr(M^2) = tr(M^4) = 0.
- Observation: Newton identities show a_{n,4} is determined by tr(M^2), tr(M^4). Thus a_{n,4} = 0 brings no new constraint beyond tr(M^2) = tr(M^4) = 0 when M is nilpotent.
- Critical gap: None of the current identities truly use the weighted constraint ∑ k z_k = 0. Coefficients/traces and α_{n+q} depend on symmetric sums and boundary effects (z_1, z_n) and adjacent products, but we do not see an index-weighted linear term emerge. We need identities explicitly involving J = diag(1,2,…,n). Candidates: tr(J M^r) expansions, and a kernel-vector approach for M v = 0 combined with discrete summation by parts and ∑ k z_k = 0.

# Critical review and targeted improvements

This writeup has good structural ideas (commutators, boundary-entry formulas, trace constraints), but there are notational inconsistencies, a few incorrect or unproven claims, and some steps that need to be formalized. Below I list issues and supply precise corrections and new rigorously provable identities that the verifier can incorporate.


Issues and corrections

1) Notation conflicts. The symbols D, J are used inconsistently in different sections.
- Suggested standardization throughout: Z := diag(z_1,…,z_n) (diagonal of unknowns), W := diag(1,…,n) (weight diagonal), L = lower shift (ones on subdiagonal), U = upper shift (ones on superdiagonal), S := L − U (skew-symmetric off-diagonal), J := L + U (symmetric off-diagonal). Then M = Z + S, and [W, M] = J.

2) Weighted-sum identity. The identity ∑_{i=1}^n i z_i = ∑_{k=1}^n S_k with S_k := ∑_{j=1}^k z_j is false in general (it equals (n+1)∑ z_i − ∑ i z_i). The exact identity is
- ∑_{i=1}^n i z_i = ∑_{k=1}^n T_k with T_k := ∑_{j=n−k+1}^n z_j = ∑_{k=1}^n (−1)^{k−1} (M^k)_{n−k+1, n}.
Under tr(M)=0 one also has ∑_{k=1}^n S_k = − ∑_{i=1}^n i z_i.

3) tr(M^3) formula. One version states tr(M^3) = ∑ z_i^3 + 3(z_1 + z_n) without hypothesis; that is only valid when tr(M)=0. The correct general identity is
- tr(M^3) = ∑_{i=1}^n z_i^3 − 3(2∑_{i=1}^n z_i − (z_1 + z_n)).
Under nilpotency (tr(M)=0), this reduces to tr(M^3) = ∑ z_i^3 + 3(z_1 + z_n).
The proof: expand tr((Z+S)^3) and note that all terms with exactly one S vanish (since S has zero diagonal and D is diagonal), tr(S^3)=0 (S skew-symmetric), and tr(D S^2) = −z_1 − 2∑_{i=2}^{n−1} z_i − z_n.

4) Path-counting for (M^{n+1})_{n,1}. The claim (M^{n+1})_{n,1} = ∑_{1≤i≤j≤n} z_i z_j − (n−1) is stated without proof. Validity requires careful boundary checks: words with one U among n L’s are not always valid (e.g., U at step 1 is invalid), and words with two Z’s plus n−1 L’s must respect both lower and upper boundaries. This combinatorial identity must be rigorously derived or removed until proved.

5) Continuant/cofactor remarks. The assertion “the λ^{n−3} coefficient identity implies e_3 = −(z_1 + z_n) when e_1=0” is unclear/misleading: for the characteristic polynomial det(λ I − M) = λ^n − e_1 λ^{n−1} + e_2 λ^{n−2} − e_3 λ^{n−3} + …, Newton identities give e_1 = tr(M), e_2 = (e_1^2 − tr(M^2))/2, e_3 = (e_2 e_1 − e_1 tr(M^2) + tr(M^3))/3. With e_1 = 0, e_2 = −tr(M^2)/2 and e_3 = tr(M^3)/3. Under nilpotency, all e_k=0 so tr(M^2)=tr(M^3)=0. Please avoid stating e_3 in terms of z_1+z_n without explicitly invoking tr(M)=0 and tr(M^2)=0.

6) Edge commutator identity usage. The identity 0 = tr([L,M] M^{k−1}) is correct (since tr([A,B]C) = tr(A[B,C]) and [M, M^{k−1}] = 0), leading to the explicit, checkable relation:
- For all k ≥ 1,
  (M^{k−1})_{1,1} − (M^{k−1})_{n,n} + ∑_{i=1}^{n−1} (z_i − z_{i+1}) (M^{k−1})_{i, i+1} = 0.
For k=1,2 this is tautological; for k ≥ 3 it yields additional linear identities among entries of M^{k−1}. This is worth recording explicitly.

7) Scope. The problem must explicitly assume n ≥ 2. For n=1, M = [z_1] is nilpotent if z_1=0, which also satisfies the weighted constraint.


New, rigorous identities to include

A) Boundary entries (fully rigorous; already sketched but should be formalized).
- For 1 ≤ k ≤ n: (M^k)_{k,1} = ∑_{j=1}^k z_j and for 0 ≤ k ≤ n−1: (M^k)_{k+1,1} = 1.
- For 1 ≤ k ≤ n: (M^k)_{n−k+1, n} = (−1)^{k−1} ∑_{j=n−k+1}^n z_j.
Consequently, ∑_{i=1}^n i z_i = ∑_{k=1}^n (−1)^{k−1} (M^k)_{n−k+1, n}.

B) Low-order traces (rigorous and general).
- tr(M^2) = ∑_{i=1}^n z_i^2 − 2(n−1).
- tr(M^3) = ∑_{i=1}^n z_i^3 − 3(2∑_{i=1}^n z_i − (z_1 + z_n)).
Under nilpotency, tr(M)=tr(M^2)=tr(M^3)=0, so ∑ z_i = 0, ∑ z_i^2 = 2(n−1), ∑ z_i^3 = −3(z_1 + z_n).

C) A clean and useful fourth-trace identity (new, with proof included).
- Claim: tr(S^4) = 6n − 10 for S = L − U and n ≥ 2.
  Proof: S^2 is symmetric with entries: (S^2)_{ii} = −1 for i ∈ {1,n}, (S^2)_{ii} = −2 for 2 ≤ i ≤ n−1, and (S^2)_{i,i±2} = 1, all other entries 0. Thus (S^2)^2 has diagonal entries equal to the sum of squares in each row of S^2, giving 2 at i=1,n; 5 at i=2,n−1; 6 for 3 ≤ i ≤ n−2. Summing yields tr(S^4) = 2 + 5 + 6(n−4) + 5 + 2 = 6n − 10 (with the n=2,3 cases checked directly).
- Hence tr(M^4) = tr((Z+S)^4) = tr(Z^4) + 6 tr(Z^2 S^2) + tr(S^4) (terms with 1 or 3 copies of S have zero trace). Since tr(Z^2 S^2) = ∑ z_i^2 (S^2)_{ii} = − z_1^2 − 2∑_{i=2}^{n−1} z_i^2 − z_n^2, we obtain the explicit identity
  tr(M^4) = ∑_{i=1}^n z_i^4 − 6 z_1^2 − 12∑_{i=2}^{n−1} z_i^2 − 6 z_n^2 + (6n − 10).
Under nilpotency, tr(M^4) = 0 provides a nontrivial constraint coupling the second and fourth power sums. This is immediately checkable for small n and should be recorded.

D) Linear functional identity (clean and useful).
- Let l = (1,…,1)^T and u = (1,2,…,n)^T. Then l^T M u = ∑_{i=1}^n i z_i − (n−1). Proof: l^T M u = ∑_j u_j (column-sum of column j of M). The column sums are z_j for 2 ≤ j ≤ n−1 and z_1 + 1, z_n − 1 at the ends, yielding the stated formula. This directly ties the weighted constraint to a simple bilinear form.


Examples and checks

- n = 2: Weighted: z_1 + 2 z_2 = 0. Nilpotency forces tr(M)=z_1 + z_2 = 0 ⇒ z_2=0 ⇒ z_1=0, but M = [[0, −1],[1, 0]] is not nilpotent. So no solution (consistent with the conjecture when n ≥ 2).
- n = 3: The provided contradiction is correct; it should be written cleanly in proofs.md using e_1=e_2=e_3=0 or the derived trace identities.


Next steps (specific and auditable)

- Consolidate notation as suggested and restate all lemmas (commutators, boundary entries, trace identities) with consistent symbols. Correct the general form of tr(M^3) in the text.
- Add rigorous proofs for the boundary-entry lemmas and for tr(M^4) (as in C). These are short and fully verifiable.
- Either supply a complete proof of the claimed (M^{n+1})_{n,1} formula (with boundary-aware path counting), or remove it pending proof. If pursued, use a reflection-principle style argument to count admissible words with one U among n L’s and two Z’s among the L’s.
- Exploit 0 = tr([L, M] M^{k−1}) explicitly for k = 3,4,5, combining with the boundary identities to derive additional linear constraints involving the z_i and entries of M^k. These can be checked symbolically for n ≤ 5 to match the computational verification.
- Document the n = 4, 5 contradictions using the now-complete identities tr(M^2)=0, tr(M^3)=0, tr(M^4)=0, the weighted sum, and possibly one commutator-derived identity. This will both validate the method and guide the general proof.


Summary of key corrections and additions

- Fix notation; correct and unify the tr(M^3) identity.
- Record the exact weighted-sum/boundary identity via suffix sums and (M^k)_{n−k+1, n}.
- Provide rigorous proofs for the boundary entries, commutator traces, and the new tr(M^4) formula with tr(S^4) = 6n − 10.
- Flag the (M^{n+1})_{n,1} formula as unproven and potentially subtle due to boundary effects; do not rely on it until proven.
- Ensure the scope excludes n=1.

These steps will make the writeup rigorous and self-consistent, and they add a tangible new tool (the tr(M^4) identity) to push contradictions beyond n=3.

# Ideas

- Derive an exact, checkable formula for the boundary entry (M^{n+2})_{n,1} by path enumeration. This clarifies which linear combinations of the z_i occur and corrects the earlier hypothesis that a weighted sum ∑ i z_i would appear at k = n+2.
- Compute tr(A^4) for A := L − U and then tr(M^4) exactly in terms of z_i and nearest-neighbor products. This supplies a new necessary identity under nilpotence (tr(M^4)=0) that couples quartic, quadratic, and adjacent products of the z_i.
- Push the matchings/continuant method one order further to give an explicit formula for the λ^{n−4} coefficient c_{n−4} in det(λI−M). Setting c_{n−4}=0 under nilpotence yields a new algebraic constraint involving e_4, e_2, nearest-neighbor sums, and boundary corrections.

# Notation

- M = Z + L − U, with Z = diag(z_1,…,z_n), L the subdiagonal shift (ones on (i+1,i)), U the superdiagonal shift (ones on (i,i+1)). Let A := L − U.
- e_k are the elementary symmetric polynomials in z_1,…,z_n; h_k are the complete homogeneous ones. Recall h_1 = e_1, h_2 = e_1^2 − e_2, h_3 = e_1^3 − 2 e_1 e_2 + e_3.

# Proposition 1 (Exact formula for (M^{n+2})_{n,1})

Claim. For all n ≥ 2,
(M^{n+2})_{n,1} = h_3(z_1,…,z_n) − (n+1) e_1(z) + (z_1 + z_n).

Proof (combinatorial path count).
View (M^k)_{n,1} as the sum of weights of length-k words in the alphabet {L, −U, Z}, acting on index positions {1,…,n}, that send 1 to n while respecting the boundary. Here L increases the index by +1 with weight +1, U decreases by −1 with weight −1 (because of the − sign in M), and Z keeps the index fixed with weight z_{current}.

For k = n+2, the net displacement must be n−1, hence if s is the number of Z’s and r the number of U’s, then the system
- r + ℓ + s = n+2,
- ℓ − r = n−1,
forces r = (3 − s)/2, so s is odd and s ∈ {1,3}. Thus two disjoint classes of words contribute:

1) s = 3, r = 0, ℓ = n−1: no U, n−1 copies of L, and three Z’s. The path visits indices 1,2,…,n monotonically; inserting three Z’s at visited vertices produces exactly h_3(z). Contribution: h_3.

2) s = 1, r = 1, ℓ = n: one Z, one U, and n copies of L. Validity exactly requires the unique U not to be the first step (to avoid leaving the path at 0) and not the last (to avoid overshooting n+1 before the U occurs). There are n−1 valid U-positions t ∈ {2,…,n} in the word of L/U steps. For a fixed U-position t, the index trajectory along the L/U steps is
1,2,3,…,t−1, t, t−1, t, t+1,…,n,
and the coefficient of z_j from this t is the number of visits to level j in this trajectory. Summing over t = 2,…,n gives the total coefficient c_j of z_j in the “one-U-one-Z” contribution. A direct count yields
- c_1 = n, c_n = n,
- c_j = n+1 for 2 ≤ j ≤ n−1.
Therefore the total “one-U-one-Z” contribution equals −∑_{j=1}^n c_j z_j = −[n z_1 + (n+1)∑_{j=2}^{n−1} z_j + n z_n] = −[(n+1) e_1 − (z_1 + z_n)].

Combining the two classes proves the formula. ∎

Corollary (consistency with nilpotence). Under nilpotence, e_1 = 0 and M^{n+2} = 0, hence (M^{n+2})_{n,1} = 0. Using h_3 = e_3 when e_1=0, the proposition reduces to e_3 + (z_1 + z_n) = 0, which matches the known λ^{n−3} coefficient identity and tr(M^3)=0 (Newton identities). Thus the k = n+2 boundary identity yields no new information beyond e_3 = −(z_1 + z_n).

Remark. This corrects the earlier speculation that (M^{n+2})_{n,1} would feature the weighted sum ∑ i z_i; it does not.

# Lemma 2 (tr(A^4) = 6n−10)

Let A = L − U. Then A^2 has diagonal entries −1 at i ∈ {1,n} and −2 for 2 ≤ i ≤ n−1, and ones on the second sub/super-diagonals; all other entries zero. Therefore
tr(A^4) = ∑_{i,j} (A^2)_{i,j}^2 = [1^2 + 1^2 + 4(n−2)] + 2(n−2) = 6n − 10.
This holds for all n ≥ 2. ∎

# Proposition 3 (Exact formula for tr(M^4))

For M = Z + A with A = L − U,
tr(M^4) = ∑_{i=1}^n z_i^4 − 4 z_1^2 − 8∑_{i=2}^{n−1} z_i^2 − 4 z_n^2 − 4 ∑_{i=1}^{n−1} z_i z_{i+1} + (6n − 10).

Proof.
Expand M^4 = (Z + A)^4 and use cyclicity of trace. Terms with an odd number of A’s have zero trace: for tr(Z^3 A) and tr(Z A^3) the diagonal of the odd power of A vanishes; likewise any cyclic variant. The 2-A terms reduce, up to cyclic equivalence, to two copies each of tr(Z^2 A^2), tr(Z A Z A), tr(Z A^2 Z). Since Z is diagonal, tr(Z^2 A^2) = tr(Z A^2 Z) = ∑ z_i^2 (A^2)_{i,i} = −z_1^2 − 2∑_{i=2}^{n−1} z_i^2 − z_n^2, and a direct 2×2 computation on neighbors gives tr(Z A Z A) = −2∑_{i=1}^{n−1} z_i z_{i+1}. Finally, add tr(Z^4) and tr(A^4) from Lemma 2. ∎

Consequence under nilpotence. Since tr(M^k) = 0 for all k ≥ 1, we obtain two constraints:
- tr(M^2) = 0 ⇒ ∑ z_i^2 = 2(n−1),
- tr(M^4) = 0 ⇒ ∑ z_i^4 − 4 z_1^2 − 8∑_{i=2}^{n−1} z_i^2 − 4 z_n^2 − 4 ∑_{i=1}^{n−1} z_i z_{i+1} + (6n − 10) = 0.
These are independent of the weighted condition and will be used together with it in subsequent steps.

# Proposition 4 (Explicit λ^{n−4} coefficient via matchings)

Write Δ_n(λ) = det(λ I − M). Then
Coefficient[λ^{n−4}] = c_{n−4} = e_4 + Q + m_2,
where m_2 = C(n−2,2) is the number of 2-edge matchings in P_n, and
Q = ∑_{edges e} ∑_{i<j, i,j ∉ V(e)} z_i z_j = ∑_{i<j} c(i,j) z_i z_j,
with explicit edge-avoidance multiplicities c(i,j):
- If |i−j| ≥ 2 (nonadjacent), c(i,j) = (n−1) − deg(i) − deg(j), i.e., n−5 if both interior, n−4 if one endpoint is a boundary vertex and the other is interior, and n−3 if {i,j} = {1,n}.
- If j = i+1 (adjacent), c(i,i+1) = (n−1) − (deg(i) + deg(i+1) − 1), i.e., n−4 if 2 ≤ i ≤ n−2, and n−3 if i ∈ {1, n−1}.
Equivalently, grouping by structures,
Q = (n−5) (e_2 − A) + [(n−3)(z_1 z_2 + z_{n−1} z_n) + (n−4) ∑_{i=2}^{n−2} z_i z_{i+1}] + [z_1 ∑_{j=3}^n z_j + z_n ∑_{i=1}^{n−2} z_i],
where A = ∑_{i=1}^{n−1} z_i z_{i+1}.

Proof.
By the standard continuant/matching expansion for tridiagonal determinants (with the signless edge weight here, since in λI−M the off-diagonal products contribute +1), the λ^{n−4} term receives contributions from matchings of size m with n−2m ≥ n−4 ⇒ m ∈ {0,1,2}. For m=0 we get e_4. For m=1, we must pick two z’s among the unmatched vertices; for each pair {i,j} this is allowed by all edges e that avoid i and j, counted by c(i,j) as stated (deg(1)=deg(n)=1, others 2). For m=2, all unmatched vertices are taken as λ, giving +1 per 2-edge matching, i.e., C(n−2,2). The regrouping identity for Q follows by separating adjacent vs. nonadjacent pairs and compensating boundary cases explicitly. ∎

Corollary under nilpotence. If M is nilpotent then c_{n−4} = 0. Together with
- e_1 = 0 (coefficient of λ^{n−1}),
- e_2 = −(n−1) (coefficient of λ^{n−2}),
- e_3 = −(z_1 + z_n) (coefficient of λ^{n−3}),
this yields a concrete algebraic relation among e_4, nearest-neighbor sums A, and boundary terms z_1,z_2,z_{n−1},z_n. This is a new independent constraint to combine with trace(M^4)=0 and the weighted condition ∑ i z_i = 0 in the next step.

# Examples/checks

- For n=3, Proposition 1 gives (M^5)_{3,1} = h_3 − 4 e_1 + (z_1 + z_3). Under e_1=0, this equals e_3 + (z_1 + z_3), coherent with e_3 = −(z_1 + z_3).
- For n≥2, Lemma 2 yields tr(A^4) = 6n−10. Direct computation for n=2 gives tr(A^4)=2, matching 6·2−10.

# Obstacles and corrections

- The earlier heuristic that (M^{n+2})_{n,1} would directly involve ∑ i z_i is false. The exact formula shows dependence only on h_3 and the unweighted sum e_1 with end correction (z_1+z_n).
- The λ^{n−4} coefficient bookkeeping is delicate near the boundary; the explicit c(i,j) coefficients above account for all such cases cleanly.

# Next steps

- Use c_{n−4}=0 with e_1=0, e_2=−(n−1), e_3=−(z_1+z_n) to solve for e_4 and A = ∑ z_i z_{i+1} in terms of boundary variables, then combine with tr(M^4)=0 to eliminate e_4 and A, producing a relation solely among z_1,z_2,z_{n−1},z_n. Test whether this, together with the weighted condition ∑ i z_i = 0, forces z_1=z_n=0 and peel the ends (induction).
- Derive analogous explicit formulas for (M^{n+3})_{n,1}. The one-U occupancy becomes triangular-number–like for two U’s (s=0) and mixed terms for s=2; these should produce nonuniform linear coefficients in z_j that better correlate with the weight vector (1,2,…,n). If successful, the vanishing of (M^{n+3})_{n,1} under nilpotence may interact directly with ∑ i z_i = 0.
- Leverage the commutator identity 0 = tr([L,M] M^{k−1}) = (M^{k−1})_{11} − (M^{k−1})_{nn} + ∑_{i=1}^{n−1} (z_i − z_{i+1}) (M^{k−1})_{i,i+1} to connect nearest-neighbor products and boundary values. Evaluate explicitly for k=2,3,4 under nilpotence to get additional linear relations.

# Summary of new, reusable results

- Exact boundary identity: (M^{n+2})_{n,1} = h_3 − (n+1) e_1 + (z_1 + z_n); under nilpotence (e_1=0) this reduces to e_3 = −(z_1+z_n).
- tr(A^4) = 6n − 10 for A = L − U.
- tr(M^4) = ∑ z_i^4 − 4 z_1^2 − 8∑_{i=2}^{n−1} z_i^2 − 4 z_n^2 − 4 ∑_{i=1}^{n−1} z_i z_{i+1} + 6n − 10.
- Explicit λ^{n−4} coefficient c_{n−4} in terms of e_4, e_2, nearest-neighbor sums, boundary corrections, and C(n−2,2). These constraints are all rigorously derived and ready to be combined with the weighted condition to seek a contradiction inductively.
