We consolidated correct identities: continuant recurrence with a_{k,1..3}, boundary entries up to k=n+1, tr(M^2), tr(M^3), and new explicit tr(A^4)=6n−10 and tr(M^4). Prover 2 provided an exact (M^{n+2})_{n,1} formula showing that ∑ i z_i does not appear, and a structurally correct formula for c_{n−4}=e_4+Q+m_2 via path matchings. The earlier claim that a_{n,4} contains ∑ i z_i is withdrawn. Main gap: we still lack a mechanism that truly uses the weighted constraint to force a contradiction. Next: combine c_{n−4}=0 with tr(M^4)=0 and e_1=e_2=e_3 constraints to eliminate interior quantities, isolate boundary variables, and peel the ends (induction).
