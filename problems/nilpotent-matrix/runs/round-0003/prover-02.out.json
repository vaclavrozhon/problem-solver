Then show that, once e_1=0 and e_2=\u2212(n\u22121) (the first two nilpotency conditions) are imposed, c_{n\u22124}=0 is equivalent to tr(M^4)=0. This clarifies redundancy among necessary conditions and sharpens what remains to be exploited together with the weighted constraint \u2211 i z_i = 0.\n- Add two rigorous, reusable \u201cweighted\u201d identities: (i) tr(W M^2) in terms of the weighted sum of squares; (ii) a summation-by-parts identity from a right-kernel vector v of M, linking \u2211 i z_i v_i^2 and nearest-neighbor products v_i v_{i+1}. These inject index-weights into the algebra and are natural bridges to the constraint \u2211 i z_i = 0.\n\n# Notation and setup\n\n- M = Z + L \u2212 U with Z = diag(z_1,\u2026,z_n), L the subdiagonal shift (ones on (i+1,i)), U the superdiagonal shift (ones on (i,i+1)). Let A := L \u2212 U.\n- \u0394_n(\u03bb) = det(\u03bb I \u2212 M) is the continuant with recurrence \u0394_{k+1} = (\u03bb \u2212 z_{k+1}) \u0394_k + \u0394_{k\u22121}, \u0394_0=1.\n- e_k are the elementary symmetric polynomials in (z_1,\u2026,z_n). Write A_nn := \u2211_{i=1}^{n\u22121} z_i z_{i+1} and B := z_1^2 + z_n^2, and p_k := \u2211 z_i^k.\n\n# Proposition A (explicit \u03bb^{n\u22124} coefficient)\n\nLet c_{n\u22124} be the coefficient of \u03bb^{n\u22124} in \u0394_n(\u03bb). Then\n\nc_{n\u22124} = e_4 + Q + m_2,\n\nwhere m_2 = C(n\u22122,2) is the number of 2-edge matchings in the path P_n, and\n\nQ = \u2211_{k=1}^{n\u22121} \u2211_{i<j, i,j \u2209 {k,k+1}} z_i z_j = \u2211_{i<j} c(i,j) z_i z_j,\n\nwith\n\n- c(i,j) = (n\u22121) \u2212 deg(i) \u2212 deg(j) if |i\u2212j| \u2265 2,\n- c(i,i+1) = (n\u22121) \u2212 (deg(i)+deg(i+1) \u2212 1),\n\nand deg(1)=deg(n)=1, deg(i)=2 for 2\u2264i\u2264n\u22121.\n\nProof.\nBy the standard matching (continuant) expansion for tridiagonals with unit off-diagonal products in \u03bbI\u2212M, a matching with m edges contributes the product of (\u03bb \u2212 z_i) over the unmatched vertices (no sign). The \u03bb^{n\u22124} coefficient arises from m=0,1,2:\n- m=0: contributes e_4.\n- m=1: pick two z\u2019s among the unmatched vertices; summing over the edge k amounts to summing over all pairs {i,j} avoided by that edge, giving Q.\n- m=2: all unmatched vertices are taken as \u03bb, yielding +1 per 2-edge matching, i.e., C(n\u22122,2).\nThis is exact. \u220e\n\nA convenient regrouping holds for Q. Writing S := \u2211 z_i, we have\n\nQ = (n\u22121) e_2 \u2212 S \u2211_{i=1}^n deg(i) z_i + \u2211_{i=1}^n deg(i) z_i^2 + A_nn.\n\nIndeed, \u2211_{i<j} (deg(i)+deg(j)) z_i z_j = S \u2211 deg(i) z_i \u2212 \u2211 deg(i) z_i^2, while the adjacency correction is precisely +\u2211_{i=1}^{n\u22121} z_i z_{i+1}. This identity is easy to check termwise.\n\n# Proposition B (redundancy: c_{n\u22124} and tr(M^4))\n\nAssume M is nilpotent so that e_1 = 0 and e_2 = \u2212(n\u22121). Then c_{n\u22124} = 0 is equivalent to tr(M^4) = 0.\n\nProof.\nUnder e_1=0, the regrouping above simplifies Q to\n\nQ = (n\u22121) e_2 + \u2211 deg(i) z_i^2 + A_nn = \u2212(n\u22121)^2 + [B + 2\u2211_{i=2}^{n\u22121} z_i^2] + A_nn.\n\nHence\n\nc_{n\u22124} = 0 \u21d4 e_4 + A_nn \u2212 B + (\u2212n^2 + 7n \u2212 4)/2 = 0.  (1)\n\nOn the other hand (proved previously),\n\ntr(M^4) = p_4 \u2212 4 B \u2212 8 \u2211_{i=2}^{n\u22121} z_i^2 \u2212 4 A_nn + (6n \u2212 10).\n\nUsing p_2 = \u2211 z_i^2 = 2(n\u22121) (nilpotence), eliminate \u2211_{i=2}^{n\u22121} z_i^2 = p_2 \u2212 B to obtain\n\ntr(M^4) = p_4 + 4 B \u2212 4 A_nn \u2212 10 n + 6.  (2)\n\nNewton\u2019s identity with e_1=0 gives p_4 = \u2212 e_2 p_2 \u2212 4 e_4 = 2(n\u22121)^2 \u2212 4 e_4. Substituting in (2):\n\ntr(M^4) = [2(n\u22121)^2 \u2212 4 e_4] + 4 B \u2212 4 A_nn \u2212 10 n + 6.\n\nThus tr(M^4)=0 is equivalent to\n\n\u22124 e_4 + 4 B \u2212 4 A_nn + 2(n\u22121)^2 \u2212 10 n + 6 = 0.\n\nDivide by 2 and rearrange:\n\ne_4 \u2212 B + A_nn + (\u2212n^2 + 7n \u2212 4)/2 = 0,\n\nwhich is exactly (1). Hence c_{n\u22124}=0 \u21d4 tr(M^4)=0 under e_1=0, e_2=\u2212(n\u22121). \u220e\n\nConsequences. For nilpotent tridiagonals of this form, a_{n,4}=0 (or c_{n\u22124}=0) imposes no new independent constraint beyond tr(M^4)=0, once e_1=e_2=0,\u2212(n\u22121) are enforced. This streamlines the set of independent necessary conditions to: e_1=0, e_2=\u2212(n\u22121), e_3=\u2212(z_1+z_n) (from either \u03bb^{n\u22123} or tr(M^3)), and tr(M^4)=0.\n\n# Lemma C (a weighted trace identity)\n\nLet W = diag(1,2,\u2026,n). Then\n\ntr(W M^2) = \u2211_{i=1}^n i z_i^2 \u2212 (n^2 \u2212 1).\n\nProof.\nAs usual (M^2)_{ii} = z_i^2 \u2212 1 for i \u2208 {1,n} and z_i^2 \u2212 2 for 2 \u2264 i \u2264 n\u22121. Thus\n\ntr(W M^2) = \u2211_{i=1}^n i (z_i^2 \u2212 \u03b1_i) with \u03b1_1=\u03b1_n=1 and \u03b1_i=2 otherwise.\n\nHence \u2211 i \u03b1_i = 1 + 2\u2211_{i=2}^{n\u22121} i + n = 1 + (n\u22121)n \u2212 2 + n = n^2 \u2212 1, yielding the claim. \u220e\n\nRemark. This identity holds for all z and isolates the weighted quadratic moment \u2211 i z_i^2. While not vanishing under nilpotence, it is a natural quantity to combine with the constraint tr(W M) = \u2211 i z_i = 0 in future steps.\n\n# Lemma D (kernel summation-by-parts identities)\n\nLet v \u2260 0 satisfy M v = 0 (exists since nilpotent \u21d2 singular). Then\n\n- \u2211_{i=1}^n z_i v_i^2 = 0,\n- \u2211_{i=1}^n i z_i v_i^2 = \u2212 \u2211_{i=1}^{n\u22121} v_i v_{i+1}.\n\nProof.\nThe equations M v = 0 read: v_2 = z_1 v_1, and for 2 \u2264 i \u2264 n\u22121, v_{i+1} = v_{i\u22121} + z_i v_i, and finally v_{n\u22121} + z_n v_n = 0. Multiply each i-th equation by v_i and sum from i=1 to n:\n\n(z_1 v_1^2 \u2212 v_2 v_1) + \u2211_{i=2}^{n\u22121} (v_{i\u22121} v_i + z_i v_i^2 \u2212 v_{i+1} v_i) + (v_{n\u22121} v_n + z_n v_n^2) = 0.\n\nThe off-diagonal terms telescope: \u2211_{i=2}^{n\u22121} (v_{i\u22121}v_i \u2212 v_{i+1}v_i) \u2212 v_2 v_1 + v_{n\u22121} v_n = 0, leaving \u2211 z_i v_i^2 = 0.\n\nNext, multiply the i-th equation by i v_i and sum. The off-diagonal part becomes\n\n\u2211_{i=2}^{n} i v_{i\u22121} v_i \u2212 \u2211_{i=1}^{n\u22121} i v_{i+1} v_i \u2212 v_2 v_1 = \u2211_{j=1}^{n\u22121} (j+1 \u2212 j) v_j v_{j+1} = \u2211_{j=1}^{n\u22121} v_j v_{j+1},\n\nyielding \u2211 i z_i v_i^2 + \u2211_{i=1}^{n\u22121} v_i v_{i+1} = 0, as claimed. \u220e\n\nRemarks.\n- These identities are fully general for our tridiagonal shape. They explicitly introduce the index-weights i on z_i via a kernel vector and therefore are promising for exploiting the condition \u2211 i z_i = 0.\n- For real data, they suggest sign constraints, e.g., if all z_i \u2265 0 and not all zero, then the first identity forbids a nontrivial kernel vector v with all v_i real. Over C, we will need further structure to leverage them.\n\n# Obstacles\n\n- The explicit closed form for c_{n\u22124} turned out to be redundant (equivalent to tr(M^4)=0) under the lower-order nilpotent constraints. Thus coefficient methods at order 4 do not yet use the weighted constraint \u2211 i z_i = 0.\n- Attempts to encode the weighted constraint into boundary-entry identities (like (M^{n+q})_{n,1}) require careful path counting at higher orders. Preliminary work suggests that k = n+2 adds no new information (it reduces to e_3 = \u2212(z_1+z_n) under e_1=0), and that k = n+3 involves intricate adjacency-weighted quadratic forms. A complete, verified formula for k = n+3 is still pending.\n\n# Next steps\n\n- Compute tr(W M^3) explicitly (parallel to tr(M^3), but with W). The preliminary decomposition shows tr(W M^3) mixes the nearest-neighbor sum A_nn and weighted moments \u2211 i z_i^3 together with endpoint corrections. Combining tr(M^3)=0, tr(W M)=0, and the new tr(W M^3) identity may pin down z_1,z_n and A_nn.\n- Complete a rigorous, fully checked formula for (M^{n+3})_{n,1} by decomposing into the s=4 (h_4), s=2 (one U, two Z) and s=0 (two U) classes. The s=0 class can be counted via the simple parameterization L^a U L^b U L^c with constraints 1 \u2264 a, 1 \u2264 b \u2264 n\u2212a, giving (n\u22121)n/2 valid skeletons; the s=2 class needs the ordered-slot count \u2211_{t} c_j(t) c_\u2113(t) developed above. Verify on n=3,4,5 by direct expansion.\n- With these in hand, try an edge-peeling induction: use e_3 = \u2212(z_1+z_n), tr(M^4)=0, tr(W M^3), and the weighted constraint to force z_1=z_n=0, then reduce to size n\u22122 (Schur complement) with the inherited weighted constraint \u2211_{i=2}^{n\u22121} (i\u22121) z_i = 0.\n\n# Summary of rigorously proven, reusable facts (this round)\n\n- Exact \u03bb^{n\u22124} coefficient: c_{n\u22124} = e_4 + Q + C(n\u22122,2) with Q = (n\u22121) e_2 \u2212 S \u2211 deg(i) z_i + \u2211 deg(i) z_i^2 + A_nn.\n- Redundancy: Under e_1=0 and e_2=\u2212(n\u22121), c_{n\u22124}=0 \u21d4 tr(M^4)=0.\n- Weighted trace: tr(W M^2) = \u2211 i i z_i^2 \u2212 (n^2 \u2212 1).\n- Kernel summation-by-parts: for v \u2208 ker M, \u2211 z_i v_i^2 = 0 and \u2211 i z_i v_i^2 = \u2212\u2211 v_i v_{i+1}.\n\nThese identities are precise, checkable, and prepared for combination with the weighted constraint and higher-order traces/entries in the next round."
