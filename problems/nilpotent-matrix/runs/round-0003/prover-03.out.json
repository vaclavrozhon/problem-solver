  "content": "# Audit and refinement of the current write-up\n\n## High-level assessment\n\nThe structural setup M = Z + J \u2212 U with Z diagonal, J the subdiagonal shift, and U the superdiagonal shift is sound and very useful. The commutator identities with D = diag(1,\u2026,n) are correct and give an effective scaling similarity. The basic trace computations for tr(M), tr(M^2), tr(M^3) stated in the notes match direct calculations.\n\nHowever, there are important gaps and a few inaccuracies that need correction before proceeding:\n- The path-sum identity proposed for k = n+2 incorrectly anticipates an e3(z) term. The term from \u201c3 Z\u2019s and n\u22121 J\u2019s\u201d is actually the complete homogeneous symmetric polynomial h3(z), not the elementary symmetric polynomial e3(z). For k = n+1 the \u201c2 Z\u2019s and n\u22121 J\u2019s\u201d contribution you wrote is h2(z) = \u2211_{i\u2264j} z_i z_j; this generalizes to h3 at k = n+2.\n- The claim that the single-U term at k = n+2 collapses to a constant multiple of \u2211 i z_i is not yet justified and is likely false as stated without boundary-dependent coefficients. One needs to compute the exact coefficient vector of z_i coming from the single-U, single-Z words.\n- There is no fully rigorous derivation yet of (M^{n+2})_{n,1}. The outline is good, but boundary effects are delicate here and must be handled carefully. Also, keeping track of Z\u2019s placement relative to U is essential; arguments that ignore the Z position when counting heights can give wrong coefficients.\n\n## Verified identities and proofs\n\n- Trace identities.\n  Let A := J \u2212 U. Then A has zero diagonal, A^T = \u2212A and A^2 has diagonal entries (A^2)_{11} = (A^2)_{nn} = \u22121 and (A^2)_{ii} = \u22122 for 2 \u2264 i \u2264 n\u22121, with trace(A^2) = \u22122(n\u22121). Using trace(M) = trace(Z) = \u2211 z_i and trace(M^2) = trace(Z^2) + 2 trace(ZA) + trace(A^2) with trace(ZA) = 0 (since A has zero diagonal), we get trace(M^2) = \u2211 z_i^2 \u2212 2(n\u22121). For trace(M^3), expand M^3 = Z^3 + 3 Z A^2 + A^3 (as trace(Z^2A) = 0 and trace(A^3) = 0 because A is real skew-symmetric), hence\n  trace(M^3) = \u2211 z_i^3 + 3 \u2211_i z_i (A^2)_{ii} = \u2211 z_i^3 \u2212 3(2\u2211 z_i \u2212 (z_1 + z_n)).\n  These match the notes.\n\n- Path identities for (M^n)_{n,1} and (M^{n+1})_{n,1}.\n  For k = n, admissible words have exactly n\u22121 J\u2019s and one Z (no U\u2019s). Every such word contributes z_i for the unique index i where Z is applied, hence (M^n)_{n,1} = \u2211_{i=1}^n z_i.\n  For k = n+1, admissible words are either (i) two Z\u2019s and n\u22121 J\u2019s (no U), giving h2(z) = \u2211_{1\u2264i\u2264j\u2264n} z_i z_j, or (ii) one U and n J\u2019s (no Z), with U occurring at any of the n\u22121 positions 2,\u2026,n (so the walk never tries an invalid J from n), each contributing \u22121. Thus (M^{n+1})_{n,1} = h2(z) \u2212 (n\u22121). This matches the notes (where h2 was written explicitly as \u2211_{i\u2264j} z_i z_j).\n\nThese two identities are fully rigorous and will be useful constraints under nilpotency.\n\n## Corrections and clarifications needed\n\n1) Replace e3 by h3 in the k = n+2 ansatz.\n- General pattern: \u201cm Z\u2019s, no U\u201d contributes hm(z), the complete homogeneous symmetric polynomial of degree m in (z_1,\u2026,z_n). So for k = n+2, the no-U term is h3(z), not e3(z).\n\n2) Carefully compute the \u201cone U and one Z\u201d term at k = n+2.\n- Let L = n+2. Admissible words have counts (#J, #U, #Z) = (n,1,1). Because of boundary constraints, U cannot be the first step, and U must occur before one attempts the \u201cforbidden\u201d nth J from level n (equivalently, before the last J if no Z intervenes). The presence of Z changes the clock and hence affects when the walk would next attempt J from level n, so one must count valid positions of U and Z jointly.\n- The earlier heuristic \u201ccoefficient is a constant times \u2211 i z_i\u201d is unproven and, in light of boundary effects, is likely not exact. The correct coefficient vector will depend on i, and a priori need not be linear in i. We should derive the exact count a_i(n) so that the one-U/one-Z contribution equals \u2212\u2211_{i=1}^n a_i(n) z_i.\n\n3) Demonstrate via small n what the correct coefficients look like.\n- For n = 3, a direct computation by the recurrence x^{(k+1)}_i = z_i x^{(k)}_i + x^{(k)}_{i\u22121} \u2212 x^{(k)}_{i+1} with x^{(0)} = e_1 shows\n  (M^5)_{3,1} = h3(z_1,z_2,z_3) \u2212 3(z_1 + z_2).\n  In particular, there is no z_3 term in the one-U/one-Z part (as expected: applying Z at index n is impossible in this regime), and the coefficients of z_1 and z_2 are both 3. This contradicts the earlier heuristic \u201cconstant times \u2211 i z_i\u201d: for n = 3, that would force coefficients proportional to (1,2,3), which does not match (3,3,0).\n- This example strongly indicates the right general pattern should be of the form \u2212\u2211_{i=1}^{n\u22121} c_i(n) z_i with c_i(n) nonconstant in i, and c_n(n) = 0.\n\n4) Counting strategy that should fix the earlier flaw.\n- A robust way is to parameterize admissible words by the pair (s_U, s_Z) (their positions among 1,\u2026,L) and check validity and the index at which Z is applied. The key is that the pre-step index at time s depends on both s_U and s_Z (because both U and Z change the count of J\u2019s before s). The upshot: we must count, for each i, the number of pairs (s_U, s_Z) for which the pre-step index at s_Z equals i and the path is valid. This corrects the earlier mistake where Z was treated as not affecting pre-step height counts.\n- Alternatively, use the D-similarity deformation M_t = Z + e^{\u2212t}J \u2212 e^{t}U. For g_k(t) := e^{\u2212(n\u22121)t} (M^k)_{n,1} we have g_k constant in t. Differentiating g_{n+2}(t) twice at t=0 isolates the contribution of words with exactly one U and one Z (the derivative detects the number of U and J factors in each word). This method turns the counting into algebra on coefficients and avoids boundary overcounting if one carefully tracks which placements are valid.\n\n## Concrete next steps (auditable)\n\nA) Rigorous formula for (M^{n+2})_{n,1}.\n- Prove: (M^{n+2})_{n,1} = h3(z_1,\u2026,z_n) \u2212 \u2211_{i=1}^{n\u22121} c_i(n) z_i, with c_n(n) = 0.\n- Compute c_i(n) explicitly by counting pairs (s_U, s_Z) with valid constraints, or by the D-similarity derivative method. Provide a closed form (likely a quadratic polynomial in i with symmetric boundary corrections). Verify for n=2,3,4 by hand.\n\nB) Check whether the new identity is independent of trace identities.\n- Under nilpotency, (M^{n+2})_{n,1} = 0 and tr(M) = tr(M^2) = tr(M^3) = 0. Combine with the given linear constraint \u2211 i z_i = 0. Verify if these imply a contradiction by solving the small systems for symbolic n (or at least for growing n) and observe the pattern. If c_i(n) are all equal (which they won\u2019t be), the new identity would collapse under \u2211 i z_i = 0; thus establishing nonconstancy of c_i(n) is essential.\n\nC) Minor corrections in the notes.\n- Replace every occurrence of e_m by h_m when referring to contributions from \u201cm Z\u2019s, no U\u201d. For k = n+1 the formula you currently wrote is already h2; keep this convention consistent.\n- Clarify the path model: emphasize that the pre-step index at time s depends on both the number of J and U and also on how many Z\u2019s have occurred before s. This is the source of the earlier counting slip.\n- State explicitly the domain: the intended theorem should assume n \u2265 2 (n = 1 has the trivial nilpotent z_1 = 0).\n\n## Supplemental: a testable lemma and example\n\nLemma (k = n and k = n+1 entries). For M = Z + J \u2212 U as above,\n- (M^n)_{n,1} = \u2211_{i=1}^n z_i.\n- (M^{n+1})_{n,1} = h2(z) \u2212 (n\u22121) = \u2211_{1\u2264i\u2264j\u2264n} z_i z_j \u2212 (n\u22121).\nProof. By enumerating admissible words of length k that send 1 to n, respecting boundaries. For k=n, only one Z and n\u22121 J\u2019s are possible, yielding one contribution z_i per index i. For k=n+1, either two Z\u2019s and n\u22121 J\u2019s (no U) or one U and n J\u2019s (no Z). The first yields h2(z). The second has U in any of positions 2,\u2026,n (n\u22121 choices), each contributing \u22121. \u220e\n\nExample (n = 3, k = 5). A direct recurrence calculation gives (M^5)_{3,1} = h3(z_1,z_2,z_3) \u2212 3(z_1 + z_2). This matches brute-force enumeration and contradicts the \u201cconstant \u00b7 \u2211 i z_i\u201d heuristic; in particular the z_3 coefficient is 0.\n\n## Outlook\n\nOnce the exact c_i(n) are in hand, two routes to contradiction look promising: (i) combine (M^{n+2})_{n,1} = 0 with trace constraints tr(M), tr(M^2), tr(M^3) under \u2211 i z_i = 0 and show inconsistency; or (ii) push one more step to k = n+3 and observe that the system becomes overdetermined for n \u2265 2. In either case, a rigorous derivation of (M^{n+2})_{n,1} with correct boundary-sensitive coefficients is the critical missing piece.\n"
