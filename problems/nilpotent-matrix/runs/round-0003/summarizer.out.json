  "summary_md": "This round established and corrected many structural identities for the tridiagonal family. We verified the continuant recurrence and explicit formulas for a_{k,1..3}; computed boundary entries \u03b1_n, \u03b1_{n+1}, \u03b1_{n+2} with the exact formula (M^{n+2})_{n,1}=h_3\u2212(n+1)e_1+(z_1+z_n) (so under e_1=0 one gets e_3=\u2212(z_1+z_n)). Low-order traces were derived: tr(M^2), tr(M^3), tr(M^4) and tr(A^4)=6n\u221210. The \u03bb^{n\u22124} coefficient was expressed as c_{n\u22124}=e_4+Q+C(n\u22122,2) and shown (under nilpotency) to be equivalent to tr(M^4)=0, hence not independent. New weighted tools were recorded: tr(WM), tr(WM^2), a computed tr(WM^3), a general weighted Laplacian identity, and kernel summation-by-parts for v\u2208ker M. Main remaining gap: none of these yet exploit the weighted constraint \u2211 i z_i=0 decisively. Next steps target W-based traces (higher r) or (M^{n+3})_{n,1} and kernel methods to force endpoint elimination and an induction. Citations: proofs.md; Research Notes.",
