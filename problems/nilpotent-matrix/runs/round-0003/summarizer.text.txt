{"summary_md":"This round established and corrected many structural identities for the tridiagonal family. We verified the continuant recurrence and explicit formulas for a_{k,1..3}; computed boundary entries α_n, α_{n+1}, α_{n+2} with the exact formula (M^{n+2})_{n,1}=h_3−(n+1)e_1+(z_1+z_n) (so under e_1=0 one gets e_3=−(z_1+z_n)). Low-order traces were derived: tr(M^2), tr(M^3), tr(M^4) and tr(A^4)=6n−10. The λ^{n−4} coefficient was expressed as c_{n−4}=e_4+Q+C(n−2,2) and shown (under nilpotency) to be equivalent to tr(M^4)=0, hence not independent. New weighted tools were recorded: tr(WM), tr(WM^2), a computed tr(WM^3), a general weighted Laplacian identity, and kernel summation-by-parts for v∈ker M. Main remaining gap: none of these yet exploit the weighted constraint ∑ i z_i=0 decisively. Next steps target W-based traces (higher r) or (M^{n+3})_{n,1} and kernel methods to force endpoint elimination and an induction.
