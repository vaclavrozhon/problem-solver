  "feedback_md": "Both provers advanced the structural toolkit, corrected earlier misconceptions, and supplied rigor-ready lemmas. However, no contradiction using the weighted constraint \u2211 i z_i = 0 has yet been obtained. Key points:\n\nProver 1\n- Strengths: Clearer notation (Z,L,U,S,W), correct boundary-entry identities, and consistent treatment of tr(M^2), tr(M^3). The \u03b1_{n+2} formula is now stated correctly and proved (see proofs update). The commutator identity tr([L,M]M^{k\u22121})=0 is properly stated and can be useful.\n- Issues: The proposed closed form for tr(W M^3) is not substantiated and appears incorrect. In particular, the claim that tr(D S W S)=0 (via \u201c(SWS) diagonal is zero\u201d) is false: (SWS) has nonzero diagonal entries, with boundary dependence (e.g., (SWS)_{11}=\u22122, (SWS)_{nn}=\u2212(n\u22121), and (SWS)_{ii}=\u22122i for interior i). Please retract this formula and recompute tr(W M^3) carefully (see next steps).\n- Corrections: Good cleanup of earlier incorrect deductions such as \u201c\u03b1_{n+2}=0 \u21d2 z_1+z_n=0\u201d. Under e_1=0 we only get e_3=\u2212(z_1+z_n).\n\nProver 2\n- Strengths: A complete, correct derivation of c_{n\u22124} and the crucial redundancy result: under e_1=0 and e_2=\u2212(n\u22121), c_{n\u22124}=0 \u21d4 tr(M^4)=0. This de-duplicates conditions and focuses effort. The weighted trace identity tr(W M^2)=\u2211 i i z_i^2 \u2212 (n^2\u22121) is correct and useful. The kernel summation-by-parts identities are correct and provide a clean way to inject index-weights.\n- Requests: For completeness, keep the exact \u03b1_{n+2} proof and the c_{n\u22124} regrouping details tight; sanity-check on n=4,5 symbolically (agrees with computations).\n\nMain gap: We still lack a mechanism that genuinely uses \u2211 i z_i = 0 to force impossibility. Coefficients/boundary-entries yield symmetric sums and boundary corrections, not index-weights. The needed leverage likely comes from weighted traces (tr(W M^r)) and/or kernel-based summation-by-parts.\n\nNext steps (concrete):\n1) Compute tr(W M^3) correctly. Expand (Z+S)^3, keep all one-S and two-S terms, and handle boundary effects explicitly. Verify on small n by CAS.\n2) Optionally derive tr(W M^4), then combine with tr(M^2)=tr(M^3)=tr(M^4)=0 and tr(W M)=0, tr(W M^2) to isolate endpoints and nearest-neighbor sums; aim to force z_1=z_n=0 and peel by induction.\n3) Finish a precise formula for (M^{n+3})_{n,1} and test whether it, together with weighted traces, adds an independent constraint.\n4) Document full contradictions for n=4,5 using the new identities to validate the emerging induction scheme.",

We corrected earlier misstatements (notably, \u03b1_{n+2} and false z_1+z_n=0 deductions) and flagged an incorrect proposal for tr(W M^3). Despite strong structural progress, we still lack a contradiction that uses \u2211 i z_i=0. Next: compute tr(W M^3) (and possibly tr(W M^4)) correctly and combine with existing constraints to force endpoint elimination and an induction step.",

    "content": "Lemma 5 (boundary entry at k = n+2).\nLet M = Z + L \u2212 U with Z = diag(z_1,\u2026,z_n), L the subdiagonal shift, U the superdiagonal shift, and define \u03b1_m := (M^m)_{n,1}. Then for all n \u2265 2,\n\u03b1_{n+2} = h_3(z_1,\u2026,z_n) \u2212 [(n+1)\u2211_{i=1}^n z_i \u2212 (z_1 + z_n)].\nProof. A word of length n+2 that maps 1 to n has net displacement n\u22121. If s is the number of diagonal steps Z and r the number of U-steps, with \u2113 L-steps, we have r + \u2113 + s = n+2 and \u2113 \u2212 r = n\u22121, hence r = (3 \u2212 s)/2 and s \u2208 {1,3}. Two disjoint types contribute: (i) s=3,r=0,\u2113=n\u22121: no U and three Z\u2019s inserted among the monotone L-chain visiting 1,2,\u2026,n. This contributes h_3(z). (ii) s=1,r=1,\u2113=n: one U and one Z. The L/U skeleton has the form L^a U L^{n\u2212a} for 1 \u2264 a \u2264 n\u22121 (U cannot be first or last). For a fixed a, there are n+2 slots to insert the Z (before each step and after the last). The index sequence along these slots is 1,2,\u2026,a,a+1,a,a+1,\u2026,n. Summing over a gives slot-visit counts c_1=c_n=n and c_j=n+1 for 2\u2264j\u2264n\u22121. Each such word has weight \u2212z_{current} from the U and the Z, hence the total contribution is \u2212\u2211 c_j z_j = \u2212[(n+1)\u2211 z_i \u2212 (z_1+z_n)]. Summing (i) and (ii) yields the formula. \u220e\n\nProposition 6 (redundancy of c_{n\u22124} with tr(M^4)).\nLet \u0394_n(\u03bb) = det(\u03bb I \u2212 M), and let c_{n\u22124} be the coefficient of \u03bb^{n\u22124}. Then\nc_{n\u22124} = e_4 + Q + C(n\u22122,2),\nwith Q = \u2211_{i<j} c(i,j) z_i z_j, where c(i,j) = (n\u22121) \u2212 deg(i) \u2212 deg(j) + 1_{|i\u2212j|=1}, deg(1)=deg(n)=1, deg(i)=2 otherwise. Assume M is nilpotent so e_1 = 0 and e_2 = \u2212(n\u22121) (equivalently, \u2211 z_i^2 = 2(n\u22121)). Then c_{n\u22124}=0 is equivalent to tr(M^4)=0.\nProof. Under e_1=0, Q = (n\u22121)e_2 + \u2211 deg(i) z_i^2 + \u2211_{i=1}^{n\u22121} z_i z_{i+1} = \u2212(n\u22121)^2 + (z_1^2 + z_n^2) + 2\u2211_{i=2}^{n\u22121} z_i^2 + A, where A = \u2211_{i=1}^{n\u22121} z_i z_{i+1}. Using \u2211 z_i^2 = 2(n\u22121), we obtain c_{n\u22124} = e_4 + A \u2212 (z_1^2 + z_n^2) + (\u2212n^2 + 7n \u2212 4)/2. On the other hand, with A as above,\ntr(M^4) = \u2211 z_i^4 \u2212 4(z_1^2 + z_n^2) \u2212 8\u2211_{i=2}^{n\u22121} z_i^2 \u2212 4A + (6n \u2212 10) = p_4 + 4(z_1^2 + z_n^2) \u2212 4A \u2212 10n + 6,\nwhere p_4 = \u2211 z_i^4 and we used \u2211 z_i^2 = 2(n\u22121). Newton\u2019s identity with e_1=0 gives p_4 = \u2212 e_2 p_2 \u2212 4 e_4 = 2(n\u22121)^2 \u2212 4 e_4. Substituting, tr(M^4)=0 is equivalent to e_4 \u2212 (z_1^2 + z_n^2) + A + (\u2212n^2 + 7n \u2212 4)/2 = 0, which is exactly c_{n\u22124}=0. \u220e\n\nLemma 7 (weighted quadratic trace).\nLet W = diag(1,2,\u2026,n). Then for all z,\ntr(W M^2) = \u2211_{i=1}^n i z_i^2 \u2212 (n^2 \u2212 1).\nProof. (M^2)_{ii} = z_i^2 \u2212 1 for i \u2208 {1,n} and z_i^2 \u2212 2 for 2 \u2264 i \u2264 n\u22121. Hence tr(W M^2) = \u2211 i i (z_i^2 \u2212 \u03b1_i) with \u03b1_1=\u03b1_n=1 and \u03b1_i=2 otherwise. The weighted constant is \u2211 i \u03b1_i = 1 + 2\u2211_{i=2}^{n\u22121} i + n = n^2 \u2212 1. \u220e\n\nLemma 8 (kernel summation-by-parts identities).\nIf v \u2260 0 satisfies M v = 0, then\n(i) \u2211_{i=1}^n z_i v_i^2 = 0.\n(ii) \u2211_{i=1}^n i z_i v_i^2 = \u2212\u2211_{i=1}^{n\u22121} v_i v_{i+1}.\nProof. The equations M v = 0 read: z_1 v_1 \u2212 v_2 = 0; v_{i\u22121} + z_i v_i \u2212 v_{i+1} = 0 for 2 \u2264 i \u2264 n\u22121; v_{n\u22121} + z_n v_n = 0. Multiply the i-th equation by v_i and sum to obtain (i). Multiplying by i v_i and summing yields (ii) after telescoping the off-diagonal terms. \u220e"
