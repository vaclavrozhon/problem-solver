However, no contradiction using the weighted constraint \u2211 i z_i = 0 has yet been obtained. Key points:\\n\\nProver 1\\n- Strengths: Clearer notation (Z,L,U,S,W), correct boundary-entry identities, and consistent treatment of tr(M^2), tr(M^3). The \u03b1_{n+2} formula is now stated correctly and proved (see proofs update). The commutator identity tr([L,M]M^{k\u22121})=0 is properly stated and can be useful.\\n- Issues: The proposed closed form for tr(W M^3) is not substantiated and appears incorrect. In particular, the claim that tr(D S W S)=0 (via \u201c(SWS) diagonal is zero\u201d) is false: (SWS) has nonzero diagonal entries, with boundary dependence (e.g., (SWS)_{11}=\u22122, (SWS)_{nn}=\u2212(n\u22121), and (SWS)_{ii}=\u22122i for interior i). Please retract this formula and recompute tr(W M^3) carefully (see next steps).\\n- Corrections: Good cleanup of earlier incorrect deductions such as \u201c\u03b1_{n+2}=0 \u21d2 z_1+z_n=0\u201d. Under e_1=0 we only get e_3=\u2212(z_1+z_n).\\n\\nProver 2\\n- Strengths: A complete, correct derivation of c_{n\u22124} and the crucial redundancy result: under e_1=0 and e_2=\u2212(n\u22121), c_{n\u22124}=0 \u21d4 tr(M^4)=0. This de-duplicates conditions and focuses effort. The weighted trace identity tr(W M^2)=\u2211 i i z_i^2 \u2212 (n^2\u22121) is correct and useful. The kernel summation-by-parts identities are correct and provide a clean way to inject index-weights.\\n- Requests: For completeness, keep the exact \u03b1_{n+2} proof and the c_{n\u22124} regrouping details tight; sanity-check on n=4,5 symbolically (agrees with computations).\\n\\nMain gap: We still lack a mechanism that genuinely uses \u2211 i z_i = 0 to force impossibility. Coefficients/boundary-entries yield symmetric sums and boundary corrections, not index-weights. The needed leverage likely comes from weighted traces (tr(W M^r)) and/or kernel-based summation-by-parts.\\n\\nNext steps (concrete):\\n1) Compute tr(W M^3) correctly. Expand (Z+S)^3, keep all one-S and two-S terms, and handle boundary effects explicitly. Verify on small n by CAS.\\n2) Optionally derive tr(W M^4), then combine with tr(M^2)=tr(M^3)=tr(M^4)=0 and tr(W M)=0, tr(W M^2) to isolate endpoints and nearest-neighbor sums; aim to force z_1=z_n=0 and peel by induction.\\n3) Finish a precise formula for (M^{n+3})_{n,1} and test whether it, together with weighted traces, adds an independent constraint.\\n4) Document full contradictions for n=4,5 using the new identities to validate the emerging induction scheme.\",\"summary_md\":\"We added rigorous lemmas: exact \u03b1_{n+2} boundary identity; explicit c_{n\u22124} and its redundancy with tr(M^4) under e_1=0, e_2=\u2212(n\u22121); tr(W M^2); and kernel summation-by-parts identities.

If s is the number of diagonal steps Z and r the number of U-steps, with \u2113 L-steps, we have r + \u2113 + s = n+2 and \u2113 \u2212 r = n\u22121, hence r = (3 \u2212 s)/2 and s \u2208 {1,3}. Two disjoint types contribute: (i) s=3,r=0,\u2113=n\u22121: no U and three Z\u2019s inserted among the monotone L-chain visiting 1,2,\u2026,n. This contributes h_3(z).

For a fixed a, there are n+2 slots to insert the Z (before each step and after the last). The index sequence along these slots is 1,2,\u2026,a,a+1,a,a+1,\u2026,n. Summing over a gives slot-visit counts c_1=c_n=n and c_j=n+1 for 2\u2264j\u2264n\u22121.

Assume M is nilpotent so e_1 = 0 and e_2 = \u2212(n\u22121) (equivalently, \u2211 z_i^2 = 2(n\u22121)). Then c_{n\u22124}=0 is equivalent to tr(M^4)=0.\\nProof. Under e_1=0, Q = (n\u22121)e_2 + \u2211 deg(i) z_i^2 + \u2211_{i=1}^{n\u22121} z_i z_{i+1} = \u2212(n\u22121)^2 + (z_1^2 + z_n^2) + 2\u2211_{i=2}^{n\u22121} z_i^2 + A, where A = \u2211_{i=1}^{n\u22121} z_i z_{i+1}. Using \u2211 z_i^2 = 2(n\u22121), we obtain c_{n\u22124} = e_4 + A \u2212 (z_1^2 + z_n^2) + (\u2212n^2 + 7n \u2212 4)/2.
