We added rigorous lemmas: exact α_{n+2} boundary identity; explicit c_{n−4} and its redundancy with tr(M^4) under e_1=0, e_2=−(n−1); tr(W M^2); and kernel summation-by-parts identities. We corrected earlier misstatements (notably, α_{n+2} and false z_1+z_n=0 deductions) and flagged an incorrect proposal for tr(W M^3). Despite strong structural progress, we still lack a contradiction that uses ∑ i z_i=0. Next: compute tr(W M^3) (and possibly tr(W M^4)) correctly and combine with existing constraints to force endpoint elimination and an induction step.
