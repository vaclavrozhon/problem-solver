{"feedback_md":"Both provers advanced the structural toolkit, corrected earlier misconceptions, and supplied rigor-ready lemmas. However, no contradiction using the weighted constraint ∑ i z_i = 0 has yet been obtained. Key points:\n\nProver 1\n- Strengths: Clearer notation (Z,L,U,S,W), correct boundary-entry identities, and consistent treatment of tr(M^2), tr(M^3). The α_{n+2} formula is now stated correctly and proved (see proofs update). The commutator identity tr([L,M]M^{k−1})=0 is properly stated and can be useful.\n- Issues: The proposed closed form for tr(W M^3) is not substantiated and appears incorrect. In particular, the claim that tr(D S W S)=0 (via “(SWS) diagonal is zero”) is false: (SWS) has nonzero diagonal entries, with boundary dependence (e.g., (SWS)_{11}=−2, (SWS)_{nn}=−(n−1), and (SWS)_{ii}=−2i for interior i). Please retract this formula and recompute tr(W M^3) carefully (see next steps).\n- Corrections: Good cleanup of earlier incorrect deductions such as “α_{n+2}=0 ⇒ z_1+z_n=0”. Under e_1=0 we only get e_3=−(z_1+z_n).\n\nProver 2\n- Strengths: A complete, correct derivation of c_{n−4} and the crucial redundancy result: under e_1=0 and e_2=−(n−1), c_{n−4}=0 ⇔ tr(M^4)=0. This de-duplicates conditions and focuses effort. The weighted trace identity tr(W M^2)=∑ i i z_i^2 − (n^2−1) is correct and useful. The kernel summation-by-parts identities are correct and provide a clean way to inject index-weights.\n- Requests: For completeness, keep the exact α_{n+2} proof and the c_{n−4} regrouping details tight; sanity-check on n=4,5 symbolically (agrees with computations).\n\nMain gap: We still lack a mechanism that genuinely uses ∑ i z_i = 0 to force impossibility. Coefficients/boundary-entries yield symmetric sums and boundary corrections, not index-weights. The needed leverage likely comes from weighted traces (tr(W M^r)) and/or kernel-based summation-by-parts.\n\nNext steps (concrete):\n1) Compute tr(W M^3) correctly. Expand (Z+S)^3, keep all one-S and two-S terms, and handle boundary effects explicitly.

Then for all n ≥ 2,\nα_{n+2} = h_3(z_1,…,z_n) − [(n+1)∑_{i=1}^n z_i − (z_1 + z_n)].\nProof. A word of length n+2 that maps 1 to n has net displacement n−1. If s is the number of diagonal steps Z and r the number of U-steps, with ℓ L-steps, we have r + ℓ + s = n+2 and ℓ − r = n−1, hence r = (3 − s)/2 and s ∈ {1,3}. Two disjoint types contribute: (i) s=3,r=0,ℓ=n−1: no U and three Z’s inserted among the monotone L-chain visiting 1,2,…,n. This contributes h_3(z). (ii) s=1,r=1,ℓ=n: one U and one Z. The L/U skeleton has the form L^a U L^{n−a} for 1 ≤ a ≤ n−1 (U cannot be first or last). For a fixed a, there are n+2 slots to insert the Z (before each step and after the last). The index sequence along these slots is 1,2,…,a,a+1,a,a+1,…,n. Summing over a gives slot-visit counts c_1=c_n=n and c_j=n+1 for 2≤j≤n−1. Each such word has weight −z_{current} from the U and the Z, hence the total contribution is −∑ c_j z_j = −[(n+1)∑ z_i − (z_1+z_n)]. Summing (i) and (ii) yields the formula. ∎\n\nProposition 6 (redundancy of c_{n−4} with tr(M^4)).\nLet Δ_n(λ) = det(λ I − M), and let c_{n−4} be the coefficient of λ^{n−4}. Then\nc_{n−4} = e_4 + Q + C(n−2,2),\nwith Q = ∑_{i<j} c(i,j) z_i z_j, where c(i,j) = (n−1) − deg(i) − deg(j) + 1_{|i−j|=1}, deg(1)=deg(n)=1, deg(i)=2 otherwise. Assume M is nilpotent so e_1 = 0 and e_2 = −(n−1) (equivalently, ∑ z_i^2 = 2(n−1)). Then c_{n−4}=0 is equivalent to tr(M^4)=0.\nProof. Under e_1=0, Q = (n−1)e_2 + ∑ deg(i) z_i^2 + ∑_{i=1}^{n−1} z_i z_{i+1} = −(n−1)^2 + (z_1^2 + z_n^2) + 2∑_{i=2}^{n−1} z_i^2 + A, where A = ∑_{i=1}^{n−1} z_i z_{i+1}. Using ∑ z_i^2 = 2(n−1), we obtain c_{n−4} = e_4 + A − (z_1^2 + z_n^2) + (−n^2 + 7n − 4)/2. On the other hand, with A as above,\ntr(M^4) = ∑ z_i^4 − 4(z_1^2 + z_n^2) − 8∑_{i=2}^{n−1} z_i^2 − 4A + (6n − 10) = p_4 + 4(z_1^2 + z_n^2) − 4A − 10n + 6,\nwhere p_4 = ∑ z_i^4 and we used ∑ z_i^2 = 2(n−1). Newton’s identity with e_1=0 gives p_4 = − e_2 p_2 − 4 e_4 = 2(n−1)^2 − 4 e_4. Substituting, tr(M^4)=0 is equivalent to e_4 − (z_1^2 + z_n^2) + A + (−n^2 + 7n − 4)/2 = 0, which is exactly c_{n−4}=0. ∎\n\nLemma 7 (weighted quadratic trace).\nLet W = diag(1,2,…,n). Then for all z,\ntr(W M^2) = ∑_{i=1}^n i z_i^2 − (n^2 − 1).\nProof. (M^2)_{ii} = z_i^2 − 1 for i ∈ {1,n} and z_i^2 − 2 for 2 ≤ i ≤ n−1. Hence tr(W M^2) = ∑ i i (z_i^2 − α_i) with α_1=α_n=1 and α_i=2 otherwise. The weighted constant is ∑ i α_i = 1 + 2∑_{i=2}^{n−1} i + n = n^2 − 1. ∎\n\nLemma 8 (kernel summation-by-parts identities).\nIf v ≠ 0 satisfies M v = 0, then\n(i) ∑_{i=1}^n z_i v_i^2 = 0.\n(ii) ∑_{i=1}^n i z_i v_i^2 = −∑_{i=1}^{n−1} v_i v_{i+1}.\nProof. The equations M v = 0 read: z_1 v_1 − v_2 = 0; v_{i−1} + z_i v_i − v_{i+1} = 0 for 2 ≤ i ≤ n−1; v_{n−1} + z_n v_n = 0. Multiply the i-th equation by v_i and sum to obtain (i). Multiplying by i v_i and summing yields (ii) after telescoping the off-diagonal terms. ∎"},"output_update":null}
