  "content": "Critical audit of the current writeup and rigorous additions\n\nExecutive summary\n\n- Several identities in the current notes contradict each other (notably for (M^{n+2})_{n,1}), and some conclusions (z_1+z_n=0) are incorrectly drawn from nilpotency. The use of the weighted constraint \u2211 i z_i = 0 is still mostly cosmetic. I correct the key formulas, provide complete proofs for the boundary entry at k = n+2 and for the weighted traces tr(W M^2), tr(W M^3), and isolate which statements hold only under \u2211 z_i=0. I also add a clean kernel summation-by-parts identity that directly involves the weight. Finally, I propose concrete, checkable next steps that genuinely inject the weighted constraint into the structure.\n\nNotation cleanup (essential)\n\n- Use Z := diag(z_1,\u2026,z_n) for the diagonal of unknowns, W := diag(1,\u2026,n) for the weight diagonal, L for the lower shift (ones on (i+1,i)), U for the upper shift (ones on (i,i+1)), and S := L \u2212 U. Then M = Z + S. Avoid reusing D for both Z and W. If J is used, reserve it for J := L + U.\n\nCorrections of flawed statements\n\n- Wrong deduction of z_1 + z_n = 0: Multiple places assert that nilpotency implies z_1 + z_n = 0 (e.g., Round 2 and Round 3 summaries). This is false. Under e_1 := \u2211 z_i = 0, one has from a_{n,3}=0 that e_3 = \u2212(z_1+z_n), and (correctly computed) (M^{n+2})_{n,1} = 0 yields the same relation. No additional conclusion follows; in particular z_1+z_n need not vanish in general.\n- Conflicting formulas for (M^{n+2})_{n,1}: Three different expressions appear. The correct one (proved below) is\n  (M^{n+2})_{n,1} = h_3(z) \u2212 [(n+1)\u2211_{i=1}^n z_i \u2212 (z_1 + z_n)].\n  Under \u2211 z_i=0 this reduces to e_3 + (z_1 + z_n).\n- Misuse of tr(M^3): The general identity is tr(M^3) = \u2211 z_i^3 \u2212 6\u2211 z_i + 3(z_1 + z_n). The shorter form \u2211 z_i^3 + 3(z_1 + z_n) holds only when \u2211 z_i = 0. Please separate these cases throughout.\n- a_{n,4} expectation: Claims that a_{n,4} contains a weighted term \u2211 i z_i are incorrect. Moreover, by Newton\u2019s identities, when M is nilpotent (so all power traces vanish), a_{n,4} = 0 is dependent on tr(M^2) = tr(M^4) = 0 and adds no independent information. Do not base the weighted argument on a_{n,4}.\n\nRigorous identities to add (with proofs)\n\n1) Boundary entries at k \u2264 n and the right-edge entries\n- For 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n: (M^k)_{k,1} = \u2211_{j=1}^k z_j, and for 0 \u2264 k \u2264 n\u22121: (M^k)_{k+1,1} = 1.\n- For 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n: (M^k)_{n\u2212k+1,n} = (\u22121)^{k-1} \u2211_{j=n\u2212k+1}^n z_j.\nProof idea. Count minimal-length paths on the line graph using D,L,U moves; to reach boundary in exactly k steps there must be exactly one D and no steps in the \u201cwrong\u201d direction. Signs from U-steps yield the right-edge factor. Details can be formalized succinctly.\n\n2) Weighted-sum translations\n- tr(WM) = \u2211 i z_i (since W commutes with Z and tr(WL) = tr(WU) = 0). Hence the constraint is tr(WM) = 0.\n- \u2211_{k=1}^n (M^k)_{k,1} = (n+1)\u2211 z_i \u2212 \u2211 i z_i. In particular, if \u2211 z_i = 0, then \u2211_{k=1}^n (M^k)_{k,1} = \u2212 \u2211 i z_i.\n- Exact right-edge identity: \u2211 i z_i = \u2211_{k=1}^n (\u22121)^{k-1} (M^k)_{n\u2212k+1,n}.\n\n3) Exact formula for (M^{n+2})_{n,1}\nClaim. With \u03b1_m := (M^m)_{n,1},\n\u03b1_{n+2} = h_3(z) \u2212 [(n+1)\u2211 z_i \u2212 (z_1 + z_n)].\nProof. Classify contributing words by number of U-steps.\n- Type A: u = 0, \u2113 = n\u22121, d = 3. Choose the 3 diagonal positions along the monotone L-chain; the contribution is h_3(z).\n- Type B: u = 1, \u2113 = n, d = 1. Every valid skeleton has the form L^{a-1} U L^{n+1\u2212a} with 2 \u2264 a \u2264 n (U cannot be first or last). There are n skeletons. For a fixed skeleton, there are n+2 slots to insert the single D, and placing it at the slot that coincides with diagonal index i contributes \u2212 z_i (sign from U). The index sequence across slots is 1,2,\u2026,a,a+1,a,a+1,\u2026,n. Summing over all a gives the endpoint multiplicities c_1 = c_n = n and interior multiplicities c_i = n+1 for 2 \u2264 i \u2264 n\u22121. Thus the type-B total is \u2212\u2211 c_i z_i = \u2212[(n+1)\u2211 z_i \u2212 (z_1+z_n)]. Adding A and B yields the formula.\nUnder \u2211 z_i = 0 this reduces to \u03b1_{n+2} = e_3 + (z_1 + z_n).\nRemark. Combined with a_{n,3} = 0 (which gives e_3 = \u2212(z_1+z_n) when \u2211 z_i = 0), we see \u03b1_{n+2} = 0 is redundant with tr(M^3)=0.\n\n4) tr(M^3) and weighted traces tr(WM^2), tr(WM^3)\nLet S = L \u2212 U. Then on the diagonal (S^2)_{ii} = \u22121 for i \u2208 {1,n} and \u22122 otherwise, and (SDS)_{ii} = \u2212(z_{i-1} + z_{i+1}), with boundary conventions z_0 = z_{n+1} = 0.\n- Diagonal of M^3: (M^3)_{ii} = z_i^3 + 2 z_i (S^2)_{ii} \u2212 (z_{i-1} + z_{i+1}). Summing gives\n  tr(M^3) = \u2211 z_i^3 \u2212 6\u2211 z_i + 3(z_1 + z_n).\n- Weighted quadratic trace:\n  tr(W M^2) = \u2211_{i=1}^n i z_i^2 \u2212 (n^2 \u2212 1).\n  Proof: (M^2)_{ii} = z_i^2 + (S^2)_{ii}, and \u03a3 i (S^2)_{ii} = \u2212[(2+\u2026+n) + (1+\u2026+n\u22121)] = \u2212(n^2 \u2212 1).\n- Weighted cubic trace:\n  tr(W M^3) = \u2211_{i=1}^n i z_i^3 \u2212 6\u2211_{i=2}^{n\u22121} i z_i \u2212 4 z_1 \u2212 (3n\u22121) z_n.\n  Proof: Using the formula for (M^3)_{ii}, multiply by i and sum. The three pieces are \u03a3 i z_i^3; 2 \u03a3 i i z_i (S^2)_{ii} = \u22124 \u03a3_{i=2}^{n\u22121} i z_i \u2212 2 z_1 \u2212 2 n z_n; and \u2212 \u03a3 i i (z_{i-1} + z_{i+1}) = \u2212[2 z_1 + (n\u22121) z_n + 2 \u03a3_{i=2}^{n\u22121} i z_i]. Adding yields the stated expression.\nThese weighted identities are new in the writeup and directly involve the weight vector.\n\n5) Commutator identity with L (useful constraint)\n[L, M] = [L, Z] + E_{1,1} \u2212 E_{n,n} with ([L, Z])_{i+1,i} = z_i \u2212 z_{i+1}. Taking traces against M^{k\u22121} (k \u2265 1) gives\n(M^{k\u22121})_{1,1} \u2212 (M^{k\u22121})_{n,n} + \u2211_{i=1}^{n\u22121} (z_i \u2212 z_{i+1}) (M^{k\u22121})_{i,i+1} = 0.\nThis couples boundary diagonal entries of M^{k\u22121} to its superdiagonal and the differences z_i \u2212 z_{i+1}. It is independent of the weighted constraint but can be combined with it.\n\n6) Kernel identities (weighted summation by parts)\nLet 0 \u2260 v \u2208 ker M satisfy v_{i+1} = v_{i-1} + z_i v_i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n\u22121) and v_{n-1} + z_n v_n = 0. Then\n- Unweighted: \u2211_{i=1}^n z_i v_i^2 = 0.\n- Weighted: \u2211_{i=1}^n i z_i v_i^2 = \u2212 \u2211_{i=1}^{n\u22121} v_i v_{i+1}.\nProof. Multiply v_{i+1} \u2212 v_{i-1} \u2212 z_i v_i = 0 by v_i (resp. i v_i) and sum i=1..n\u22121. The left-hand sides telescope; use v_0 = 0 and the last row relation to handle the n-end. These identities inject the weights into the kernel structure.\n\nSanity check on n = 3 (corrected)\n\nUnder nilpotency: e_1 = 0, e_2 = \u22122, and e_3 = \u2212(z_1 + z_3). The weighted constraint gives z_1 + 2 z_2 + 3 z_3 = 0 \u21d2 z_2 = \u22122 z_3, z_1 = z_3. Then e_2 = z_1 z_2 + z_1 z_3 + z_2 z_3 = \u22123 z_3^2 contradicts e_2 = \u22122. Hence no nilpotent exists for n = 3, consistent with computations.\n\nWhat remains unclear or incomplete\n\n- The role of \u2211 i z_i = 0 is still not exploited decisively. The identities a_{n,k}, \u03b1_{n+q}, tr(M^k) depend on symmetric sums and boundary (z_1, z_n) corrections; they do not themselves encode index weights.\n- The structural formula for c_{n\u22124} is sketched but not fully proved, and regroupings in the notes are inconsistent. Before using c_{n\u22124} in any elimination, the combinatorial derivation (via matchings with endpoint corrections) must be written cleanly and verified on n = 4, 5.\n- Several summaries still state the incorrect implication \u201c\u03b1_{n+2} and nilpotency give z_1+z_n=0.\u201d These must be corrected to \u201ce_3 = \u2212(z_1+z_n).\u201d\n\nActionable next steps (auditable)\n\n- Correct the document: unify notation (Z,L,U,S,W), replace all occurrences of the wrong \u03b1_{n+2} formula and remove the incorrect z_1+z_n deduction. Clearly separate general identities from their nilpotent specializations.\n- Add the fully proved formulas above: (i) \u03b1_{n+2} identity; (ii) tr(WM^2), tr(WM^3); (iii) kernel summation-by-parts identities.\n- Compute tr(WM^4). Proceed as for tr(M^4): expand M = Z + S; kill odd-in-S contributions; evaluate two-S terms (Z^2 S^2 and Z S Z S) under the weight; add the four-S term tr(W S^4) (S^4 is banded with explicitly known diagonal). This will yield a new weighted equation involving \u2211 i z_i^4, weighted nearest-neighbor sums, and boundary corrections.\n- Combine constraints systematically: with nilpotency we have e_1=0, e_2=\u2212(n\u22121), and e_3=\u2212(z_1+z_n), plus tr(M^4)=0. Add tr(WM)=0 and the explicit tr(WM^2), tr(WM^3) (and tr(WM^4) once computed). Use these to solve for the endpoint variables (z_1,z_n) in terms of interior aggregates and then derive a contradiction or an induction step via a Schur-complement peeling (showing the middle (n\u22122) block inherits an analogous weighted constraint).\n- Validate on n = 4,5 by hand/algebra system using the corrected identities, to confirm the pathway aligns with the computational evidence and to refine the induction.\n\nClosing remark\n\nThe main mathematical backbone (continuant recurrence, low-order traces, boundary entries, and A^4 counts) is solid after corrections. The additions here supply the first genuinely weighted higher-order identities, which should be the centerpiece for the next pass: tr(WM^3) (now proved) and tr(WM^4) (to be derived) are the natural levers to bring \u2211 i z_i = 0 into decisive conflict with nilpotency for general n."
