Critical audit of the current writeup and rigorous additions

Executive summary

- Several identities in the current notes contradict each other (notably for (M^{n+2})_{n,1}), and some conclusions (z_1+z_n=0) are incorrectly drawn from nilpotency. The use of the weighted constraint ∑ i z_i = 0 is still mostly cosmetic. I correct the key formulas, provide complete proofs for the boundary entry at k = n+2 and for the weighted traces tr(W M^2), tr(W M^3), and isolate which statements hold only under ∑ z_i=0. I also add a clean kernel summation-by-parts identity that directly involves the weight. Finally, I propose concrete, checkable next steps that genuinely inject the weighted constraint into the structure.

Notation cleanup (essential)

- Use Z := diag(z_1,…,z_n) for the diagonal of unknowns, W := diag(1,…,n) for the weight diagonal, L for the lower shift (ones on (i+1,i)), U for the upper shift (ones on (i,i+1)), and S := L − U. Then M = Z + S. Avoid reusing D for both Z and W. If J is used, reserve it for J := L + U.

Corrections of flawed statements

- Wrong deduction of z_1 + z_n = 0: Multiple places assert that nilpotency implies z_1 + z_n = 0 (e.g., Round 2 and Round 3 summaries). This is false. Under e_1 := ∑ z_i = 0, one has from a_{n,3}=0 that e_3 = −(z_1+z_n), and (correctly computed) (M^{n+2})_{n,1} = 0 yields the same relation. No additional conclusion follows; in particular z_1+z_n need not vanish in general.
- Conflicting formulas for (M^{n+2})_{n,1}: Three different expressions appear. The correct one (proved below) is
  (M^{n+2})_{n,1} = h_3(z) − [(n+1)∑_{i=1}^n z_i − (z_1 + z_n)].
  Under ∑ z_i=0 this reduces to e_3 + (z_1 + z_n).
- Misuse of tr(M^3): The general identity is tr(M^3) = ∑ z_i^3 − 6∑ z_i + 3(z_1 + z_n). The shorter form ∑ z_i^3 + 3(z_1 + z_n) holds only when ∑ z_i = 0. Please separate these cases throughout.
- a_{n,4} expectation: Claims that a_{n,4} contains a weighted term ∑ i z_i are incorrect. Moreover, by Newton’s identities, when M is nilpotent (so all power traces vanish), a_{n,4} = 0 is dependent on tr(M^2) = tr(M^4) = 0 and adds no independent information. Do not base the weighted argument on a_{n,4}.

Rigorous identities to add (with proofs)

1) Boundary entries at k ≤ n and the right-edge entries
- For 1 ≤ k ≤ n: (M^k)_{k,1} = ∑_{j=1}^k z_j, and for 0 ≤ k ≤ n−1: (M^k)_{k+1,1} = 1.
- For 1 ≤ k ≤ n: (M^k)_{n−k+1,n} = (−1)^{k-1} ∑_{j=n−k+1}^n z_j.
Proof idea. Count minimal-length paths on the line graph using D,L,U moves; to reach boundary in exactly k steps there must be exactly one D and no steps in the “wrong” direction. Signs from U-steps yield the right-edge factor. Details can be formalized succinctly.

2) Weighted-sum translations
- tr(WM) = ∑ i z_i (since W commutes with Z and tr(WL) = tr(WU) = 0). Hence the constraint is tr(WM) = 0.
- ∑_{k=1}^n (M^k)_{k,1} = (n+1)∑ z_i − ∑ i z_i. In particular, if ∑ z_i = 0, then ∑_{k=1}^n (M^k)_{k,1} = − ∑ i z_i.
- Exact right-edge identity: ∑ i z_i = ∑_{k=1}^n (−1)^{k-1} (M^k)_{n−k+1,n}.

3) Exact formula for (M^{n+2})_{n,1}
Claim. With α_m := (M^m)_{n,1},
α_{n+2} = h_3(z) − [(n+1)∑ z_i − (z_1 + z_n)].
Proof. Classify contributing words by number of U-steps.
- Type A: u = 0, ℓ = n−1, d = 3. Choose the 3 diagonal positions along the monotone L-chain; the contribution is h_3(z).
- Type B: u = 1, ℓ = n, d = 1. Every valid skeleton has the form L^{a-1} U L^{n+1−a} with 2 ≤ a ≤ n (U cannot be first or last). There are n skeletons. For a fixed skeleton, there are n+2 slots to insert the single D, and placing it at the slot that coincides with diagonal index i contributes − z_i (sign from U). The index sequence across slots is 1,2,…,a,a+1,a,a+1,…,n. Summing over all a gives the endpoint multiplicities c_1 = c_n = n and interior multiplicities c_i = n+1 for 2 ≤ i ≤ n−1. Thus the type-B total is −∑ c_i z_i = −[(n+1)∑ z_i − (z_1+z_n)]. Adding A and B yields the formula.
Under ∑ z_i = 0 this reduces to α_{n+2} = e_3 + (z_1 + z_n).
Remark. Combined with a_{n,3} = 0 (which gives e_3 = −(z_1+z_n) when ∑ z_i = 0), we see α_{n+2} = 0 is redundant with tr(M^3)=0.

4) tr(M^3) and weighted traces tr(WM^2), tr(WM^3)
Let S = L − U. Then on the diagonal (S^2)_{ii} = −1 for i ∈ {1,n} and −2 otherwise, and (SDS)_{ii} = −(z_{i-1} + z_{i+1}), with boundary conventions z_0 = z_{n+1} = 0.
- Diagonal of M^3: (M^3)_{ii} = z_i^3 + 2 z_i (S^2)_{ii} − (z_{i-1} + z_{i+1}). Summing gives
  tr(M^3) = ∑ z_i^3 − 6∑ z_i + 3(z_1 + z_n).
- Weighted quadratic trace:
  tr(W M^2) = ∑_{i=1}^n i z_i^2 − (n^2 − 1).
  Proof: (M^2)_{ii} = z_i^2 + (S^2)_{ii}, and Σ i (S^2)_{ii} = −[(2+…+n) + (1+…+n−1)] = −(n^2 − 1).
- Weighted cubic trace:
  tr(W M^3) = ∑_{i=1}^n i z_i^3 − 6∑_{i=2}^{n−1} i z_i − 4 z_1 − (3n−1) z_n.
  Proof: Using the formula for (M^3)_{ii}, multiply by i and sum. The three pieces are Σ i z_i^3; 2 Σ i i z_i (S^2)_{ii} = −4 Σ_{i=2}^{n−1} i z_i − 2 z_1 − 2 n z_n; and − Σ i i (z_{i-1} + z_{i+1}) = −[2 z_1 + (n−1) z_n + 2 Σ_{i=2}^{n−1} i z_i]. Adding yields the stated expression.
These weighted identities are new in the writeup and directly involve the weight vector.

5) Commutator identity with L (useful constraint)
[L, M] = [L, Z] + E_{1,1} − E_{n,n} with ([L, Z])_{i+1,i} = z_i − z_{i+1}. Taking traces against M^{k−1} (k ≥ 1) gives
(M^{k−1})_{1,1} − (M^{k−1})_{n,n} + ∑_{i=1}^{n−1} (z_i − z_{i+1}) (M^{k−1})_{i,i+1} = 0.
This couples boundary diagonal entries of M^{k−1} to its superdiagonal and the differences z_i − z_{i+1}. It is independent of the weighted constraint but can be combined with it.

6) Kernel identities (weighted summation by parts)
Let 0 ≠ v ∈ ker M satisfy v_{i+1} = v_{i-1} + z_i v_i (1 ≤ i ≤ n−1) and v_{n-1} + z_n v_n = 0. Then
- Unweighted: ∑_{i=1}^n z_i v_i^2 = 0.
- Weighted: ∑_{i=1}^n i z_i v_i^2 = − ∑_{i=1}^{n−1} v_i v_{i+1}.
Proof. Multiply v_{i+1} − v_{i-1} − z_i v_i = 0 by v_i (resp. i v_i) and sum i=1..n−1. The left-hand sides telescope; use v_0 = 0 and the last row relation to handle the n-end. These identities inject the weights into the kernel structure.

Sanity check on n = 3 (corrected)

Under nilpotency: e_1 = 0, e_2 = −2, and e_3 = −(z_1 + z_3). The weighted constraint gives z_1 + 2 z_2 + 3 z_3 = 0 ⇒ z_2 = −2 z_3, z_1 = z_3. Then e_2 = z_1 z_2 + z_1 z_3 + z_2 z_3 = −3 z_3^2 contradicts e_2 = −2. Hence no nilpotent exists for n = 3, consistent with computations.

What remains unclear or incomplete

- The role of ∑ i z_i = 0 is still not exploited decisively. The identities a_{n,k}, α_{n+q}, tr(M^k) depend on symmetric sums and boundary (z_1, z_n) corrections; they do not themselves encode index weights.
- The structural formula for c_{n−4} is sketched but not fully proved, and regroupings in the notes are inconsistent. Before using c_{n−4} in any elimination, the combinatorial derivation (via matchings with endpoint corrections) must be written cleanly and verified on n = 4, 5.
- Several summaries still state the incorrect implication “α_{n+2} and nilpotency give z_1+z_n=0.” These must be corrected to “e_3 = −(z_1+z_n).”

Actionable next steps (auditable)

- Correct the document: unify notation (Z,L,U,S,W), replace all occurrences of the wrong α_{n+2} formula and remove the incorrect z_1+z_n deduction. Clearly separate general identities from their nilpotent specializations.
- Add the fully proved formulas above: (i) α_{n+2} identity; (ii) tr(WM^2), tr(WM^3); (iii) kernel summation-by-parts identities.
- Compute tr(WM^4). Proceed as for tr(M^4): expand M = Z + S; kill odd-in-S contributions; evaluate two-S terms (Z^2 S^2 and Z S Z S) under the weight; add the four-S term tr(W S^4) (S^4 is banded with explicitly known diagonal). This will yield a new weighted equation involving ∑ i z_i^4, weighted nearest-neighbor sums, and boundary corrections.
- Combine constraints systematically: with nilpotency we have e_1=0, e_2=−(n−1), and e_3=−(z_1+z_n), plus tr(M^4)=0. Add tr(WM)=0 and the explicit tr(WM^2), tr(WM^3) (and tr(WM^4) once computed). Use these to solve for the endpoint variables (z_1,z_n) in terms of interior aggregates and then derive a contradiction or an induction step via a Schur-complement peeling (showing the middle (n−2) block inherits an analogous weighted constraint).
- Validate on n = 4,5 by hand/algebra system using the corrected identities, to confirm the pathway aligns with the computational evidence and to refine the induction.

Closing remark

The main mathematical backbone (continuant recurrence, low-order traces, boundary entries, and A^4 counts) is solid after corrections. The additions here supply the first genuinely weighted higher-order identities, which should be the centerpiece for the next pass: tr(WM^3) (now proved) and tr(WM^4) (to be derived) are the natural levers to bring ∑ i z_i = 0 into decisive conflict with nilpotency for general n.
