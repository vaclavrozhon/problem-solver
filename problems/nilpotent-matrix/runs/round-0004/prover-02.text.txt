# Audit of the current writeup: issues, fixes, and concrete next steps

## Executive summary

- Several identities are now correct and useful (continuant recurrence; (M^n)_{n,1}, (M^{n+1})_{n,1}, the exact (M^{n+2})_{n,1}; tr(M^2), tr(M^3); tr(A^4)=6n−10; tr(M^4)).
- However, there remain inconsistencies and some incorrect claims in summaries and formulas (notably: α_{n+2} ⇒ z_1+z_n=0; an earlier wrong tr(WM^2); an erroneous regrouping for Q in c_{n−4}). Notation is also overloaded in places.
- The main gap persists: no identity yet leverages the weighted constraint ∑ i z_i = 0 decisively. The proposed plan to use weighted traces or l^T M^k u is sound; it needs to be executed rigorously.

## Notation and consistency

- Overloading: D was used both for diag(1,…,n) and diag(z_i), and α for different objects. Fix Z := diag(z_i), W := diag(1,…,n); reserve α_k for leading principal minors only; use β_k := (M^k)_{n,1} for boundary entries. Reserve σ_k(z) for elementary symmetric polynomials in the diagonal variables (to avoid confusing them with eigenvalue-based charpoly coefficients).
- Summaries must be corrected: statements like “using α_{n+2} … gave E_3=0 and hence z_1+z_n=0” are false. Under nilpotency and ∑ z_i=0 one gets σ_3(z) = −(z_1+z_n), not σ_3(z)=0.

## Correct results to keep (and to move to proofs.md)

- Boundary entries: (M^n)_{n,1} = ∑ z_i; (M^{n+1})_{n,1} = h_2(z) − (n−1); (M^{n+2})_{n,1} = h_3(z) − (n+1)∑ z_i + (z_1+z_n). Under ∑ z_i=0, (M^{n+2})_{n,1} = e_3 + (z_1+z_n), so vanishing is equivalent to σ_3(z) = −(z_1+z_n).
- Traces: tr(M^2) = ∑ z_i^2 − 2(n−1); tr(M^3) = ∑ z_i^3 − 6∑ z_i + 3(z_1+z_n); tr(A^4) = 6n−10 for A=L−U; tr(M^4) = ∑ z_i^4 − 4 z_1^2 − 8∑_{i=2}^{n−1} z_i^2 − 4 z_n^2 − 4∑_{i=1}^{n−1} z_i z_{i+1} + (6n−10). These should be stated once, proved cleanly, and used consistently.

## Errors/ambiguities to fix

1) Weighted trace tr(WM^2): One place states tr(WM^2) = ∑ i z_i^2 − (n^2−1), which is wrong. The correct formula is tr(WM^2) = ∑_{i=1}^n i z_i^2 − (n^2−1) because (M^2)_{ii} depends on i via boundary corrections. Please remove the incorrect version and keep only the correct weighted identity.

2) α_{n+2} implication: Remove all claims that α_{n+2}=0 (or tr(M^3)=0) forces z_1+z_n=0. The correct relation under ∑ z_i=0 is σ_3(z) = −(z_1+z_n).

3) c_{n−4} regrouping: The earlier decomposition of Q in terms of interior/endpoint corrections is incorrect (fails already at n=4). A correct closed form is
- c_{n−4} = σ_4(z) + Q + C(n−2,2), with Q = ∑_{edges e} ∑_{i<j, i,j∉V(e)} z_i z_j,
- and the compact identity Q = (n−1) σ_2(z) − e_1(z) ∑_{i=1}^n deg(i) z_i + ∑_{i=1}^n deg(i) z_i^2 + A,
  where deg(1)=deg(n)=1, deg(i)=2 otherwise, and A = ∑_{i=1}^{n−1} z_i z_{i+1}.
Proof: For fixed pair {i,j}, the number of edges avoiding both vertices equals c(i,j) = (n−1) − deg(i) − deg(j) + 1_{|i−j|=1}. Then Q = ∑_{i<j} c(i,j) z_i z_j; expand ∑ deg(i) z_i ∑ z_j and separate the adjacent-pair indicator to isolate A. Sanity checks for n=4,5 pass. Replace the erroneous regrouping with this identity and provide a short proof.

4) Unproven weighted identities: A formula for tr(WM^3) is stated late in the notes but not derived. This is delicate; please either include a full derivation (via expanding (Z+A)^3, keeping careful track of boundary corrections under W) or remove it until proved. Suggest approach: use cyclicity to reduce to tr(WZ^3), tr(W Z^2 A^1), tr(W Z A Z), tr(W A Z^2), tr(W A^2 Z), tr(W Z A^2), noting that odd-A terms do not vanish a priori because W is not central.

5) Commute-and-trace identity: The displayed formula 0 = tr([L,M] M^{k−1}) = (M^{k−1})_{11} − (M^{k−1})_{nn} + ∑ (z_i − z_{i+1}) (M^{k−1})_{i,i+1} is not justified (missing [L,−U] terms). Keep only the abstract identity tr([L,M] M^{k−1})=0 or provide a correct entrywise expansion including all contributions.

6) Kernel-vector “summation-by-parts”: The identities ∑ i z_i v_i^2 = 0 and ∑ i i z_i v_i^2 = −∑ v_i v_{i+1} for v ∈ ker M are not derived and likely incorrect as written (the Mv=0 recurrence is v_{i+1} = v_{i−1} + z_i v_i, with boundary equations at i=1,n; one must handle boundaries carefully). Remove these claims or supply a rigorous derivation that tracks boundary terms.

## Clarity improvements

- Separate clearly: (i) identities valid for all such tridiagonals; (ii) consequences under nilpotency (e.g., tr(M^k)=0, β_{n+q}=0); (iii) uses of the weighted constraint ∑ i z_i = 0. This will prevent logical cross-contamination.
- State small-n verifications precisely (n=3,4,5): give the explicit contradiction derivation or provide a CAS script reference; do not just say “ruled out.”

## Concrete next steps (to actually exploit ∑ i z_i = 0)

1) Weighted traces: Compute tr(WM^3) rigorously. Combine with tr(WM)=0, tr(WM^2)=∑ i i z_i^2 − (n^2−1), and nilpotency traces tr(M^2)=tr(M^3)=tr(M^4)=0 to obtain linear relations that involve endpoints vs. interior (because W breaks symmetry). Target: deduce z_1=z_n=0.

2) Boundary elimination using c_{n−4}: With the corrected c_{n−4}=0 and tr(M^4)=0, eliminate A and σ_4(z) in favor of boundary variables (z_1,z_2,z_{n−1},z_n). Inject the weighted constraint to force endpoint vanishing. Validate this mechanism explicitly for n=4,5.

3) l^T M^k u moments: For s_k := l^T M^k u, we have s_1 = ∑ i z_i − (n−1); under nilpotency s_k=0 for k≥n. Compute s_{n+1} and s_{n+2} via path enumeration (similar to β_{n+q}) to obtain index-weighted symmetric combinations that can be combined with traces.

4) Induction/peeling: If endpoint vanishing can be established, formalize a valid reduction (e.g., via a similarity that splits off the ends or via a rank argument) ensuring the middle (n−2)×(n−2) block retains the form and inherits a weighted constraint ∑_{i=2}^{n−1} (i−1) z_i = 0. This step needs a rigorous lemma; do not assume it.

## Quick counterexamples/sanity checks

- c_{n−4} regrouping (n=4): Q must equal z_1 z_2 + z_3 z_4 + z_1 z_4. The earlier regrouping produces an extra −z_2 z_3 term; hence it is wrong.
- tr(WM^2) misstatement (n=2): With z=(a,b), the incorrect formula gives a^2 + b^2 − 3, but the true value is a^2 + 2 b^2 − 3.

Implementing these corrections and completing the weighted-trace calculations should make the argument both rigorous and poised to derive a contradiction for all n.
