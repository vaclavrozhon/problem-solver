Writing M = Z + L \u2212 U (Z diagonal with entries z_i, L the subdiagonal shift, U the superdiagonal shift) and using W = diag(1,\u2026,n) with [W,L] = L, [W,U] = \u2212U, hence e^{\u2212tW} M e^{tW} = Z + e^{\u2212t} L \u2212 e^{t} U is correct. These are valuable for similarity-invariant arguments and for separating contributions by the number of U/L factors.\\n\\n- Basic trace identities. The formulas\\n  tr(M) = \u2211 z_i,\\n  tr(M^2) = \u2211 z_i^2 \u2212 2(n\u22121),\\n  tr(M^3) = \u2211 z_i^3 \u2212 3(2\u2211 z_i \u2212 (z_1 + z_n))\\n  are correct (the derivation via A := L \u2212 U with A^2 diagonal and tr(Z^k A^\u2113) vanishing for odd \u2113 is solid). Under nilpotency, these vanish, yielding necessary constraints.\\n\\n- Path-sum boundary entries for k = n and k = n+1. The identities\\n  (M^n)_{n,1} = \u2211_{i=1}^n z_i,\\n  (M^{n+1})_{n,1} = h_2(z) \u2212 (n\u22121) = \u2211_{1\u2264i\u2264j\u2264n} z_i z_j \u2212 (n\u22121)\\n  are rigorously justified by enumerating admissible words in {L,Z,\u2212U} sending e_1 to e_n.\\n\\n- Trace of A^4 and tr(M^4). The count tr(A^4) = 6n \u2212 10 is correct (length-4 returns at interior sites are 6, with boundary corrections); and the expansion\\n  tr(M^4) = \u2211 z_i^4 \u2212 4 z_1^2 \u2212 8\u2211_{i=2}^{n\u22121} z_i^2 \u2212 4 z_n^2 \u2212 4\u2211_{i=1}^{n\u22121} z_i z_{i+1} + (6n \u2212 10)\\n  is correct when decomposed into tr(Z^4), two-A terms (four copies of tr(Z^2 A^2) and two copies of tr(Z A Z A)), and tr(A^4).\\n\\n- Weighted linear identities. Both\\n  tr(WM) = \u2211_{i=1}^n i z_i,\\n  l^T M u = \u2211_{i=1}^n i z_i \u2212 (n\u22121) for l = (1,\u2026,1)^T and u = (1,2,\u2026,n)^T\\n  are correct. The constraint \u2211 i z_i = 0 is equivalent to tr(WM) = 0 and to l^T M u = \u2212(n\u22121).\\n\\n## Major flaws and inconsistencies that must be fixed\\n\\n1) Misstatement about (M^{n+2})_{n,1} and e_3.\\n- Early notes expect (M^{n+2})_{n,1} = e_3(z) \u2212 C_n \u2211 i z_i. This is not correct. The no-U sector contributes h_3 (complete homogeneous symmetric polynomial of degree 3), not e_3. The correct one-U/one-Z contribution has nonconstant index-dependent coefficients; it does not reduce to a single multiple of \u2211 i z_i.\\n- This is later corrected in the write-up, but the earlier incorrect expectation should be removed to avoid confusion.\\n\\n2) Incorrect claim that \u03b1_{n+2} enforces z_1 + z_n = 0.\\n- At one point the notes assert: \u201cUsing \u03b1_{n+2} enforces z_1 + z_n = 0 and hence E_3 = 0.\u201d This is false. The correct formula (proved later) is\\n  (M^{n+2})_{n,1} = h_3(z) \u2212 [(n+1) e_1(z) \u2212 (z_1 + z_n)].\\n  Under e_1 = 0 (true if M is nilpotent), this reads h_3 + (z_1 + z_n) = 0. Using Newton with e_1 = 0 gives h_3 = e_3 and tr(M^3) = \u2211 z_i^3 + 3(z_1 + z_n) = 0 \u21d4 e_3 = \u2212(z_1 + z_n). Thus \u03b1_{n+2} and tr(M^3) are equivalent constraints when e_1 = 0; neither implies z_1 + z_n = 0 individually. This incorrect inference should be removed.\\n\\n3) Wrong identity for h_3 in terms of p_3 and e_3.\\n- The statement \u201cWith S = \u2211 z_i = 0, \u03b1_{n+2} = h_3 = (2/3) \u2211 z_i^3 \u2212 E_3\u201d is incorrect. The correct relation is h_3 = (p_1^3 + 3 p_1 p_2 + 2 p_3)/6; with p_1 = 0 one has h_3 = p_3/3. Also, when e_1 = 0, h_3 = e_3. Please delete the spurious \u201c(2/3)\u2211 z_i^3 \u2212 E_3\u201d.\\n\\n4) Notation conflicts and drift.\\n- D has been used both for diag(z_i) and for diag(1,\u2026,n). Settle on Z := diag(z_i) and W := diag(1,\u2026,n), use L for the subdiagonal shift and U for the superdiagonal shift, and A := L \u2212 U. Avoid introducing J := L + U or S unless actually needed.\\n\\n5) Overclaim regarding a_{n,4}.\\n- The notes assert an explicit formula for a_{n,4} and subsequently that \u201cNewton identities show a_{n,4} is determined by tr(M^2), tr(M^4). Thus a_{n,4} = 0 brings no new constraint beyond tr(M^2) = tr(M^4) = 0.\u201d The dependence on traces is true via Newton identities for eigenvalues, but the stated explicit a_{n,4} expression needs a rigorous derivation (e.g., by continuant recurrence) and verification for small n. Until that proof is supplied, mark the formula as a conjectured expression or move it to notes.md with a \u201cto prove\u201d tag.\\n\\n6) The n = 3 \u201cruled out\u201d claim lacks a visible proof.\\n- The text says \u201cn=3 is ruled out (see proofs.md)\u201d, but no such proof appears in the shared excerpts. Either include a short, complete argument or remove the claim and keep it as a checked computational fact. For credibility, provide a compact derivation specifically invoking the weighted constraint z_1 + 2 z_2 + 3 z_3 = 0.\\n\\n## Points needing clearer proofs or details\\n\\nA) The k = n+2 boundary identity.\\n- The corrected formula is\\n  (M^{n+2})_{n,1} = h_3(z_1,\u2026,z_n) \u2212 [(n+1)\u2211 z_i \u2212 (z_1 + z_n)].\\n  The outline via skeletons W_t = L^{t\u22121} U L^{n+1\u2212t}, t = 2,\u2026,n, and insertion of a single Z in any of the n+2 slots is sound, but a fully rigorous write-up should:\\n  1) Justify that each skeleton is valid and that Z-insertion preserves validity (no boundary violations occur).\\n  2) Compute, for each index i, the exact count c_i of placements that yield a Z at site i; show c_1 = c_n = n and c_i = n+1 for 2 \u2264 i \u2264 n\u22121.\\n  3) Verify the sign (each U contributes \u22121) and sum over all t.\\n  This fills the key combinatorial gap and aligns with the n = 3 check c = (3,4,3).\\n\\nB) Continuant coefficient derivations a_{n,1}, a_{n,2}, a_{n,3}, a_{n,4}.\\n- The recurrences P_k(\u03bb) = det(\u03bb I \u2212 M_{[k]}) with P_k = (\u03bb \u2212 z_k) P_{k\u22121} + P_{k\u22122}, P_0 = 1, P_1 = \u03bb \u2212 z_1 give a clean inductive route to the first four coefficients. Please include (in proofs.md):\\n  - A proof that a_{k,1} = \u2212\u2211_{j \u2264 k} z_j.\\n  - A proof that a_{k,2} = \u2211_{i<j \u2264 k} z_i z_j + (k \u2212 1).\\n  - A proof that a_{k,3} = \u2212\u2211_{i<j<\u2113 \u2264 k} z_i z_j z_\u2113 \u2212 (k \u2212 3)\u2211_{j \u2264 k} z_j \u2212 (z_1 + z_k).\\n  - A rigorous derivation (or at least an induction hypothesis and verification for k up to, say, 6) for a_{k,4}. This will clarify the boundary/adjacency terms.\\n\\nC) Independence and redundancy of constraints.\\n- It is important to record explicitly that, under e_1 = tr(M) = 0, the k = n+2 boundary identity is equivalent to tr(M^3) = 0 (via h_3 = e_3 = p_3/3). This prevents repeating redundant constraints later.\\n\\n## How to actually inject the weighted constraint (critical gap)\\n\\n- The current identities (traces, coefficients, boundary entries) do not involve the weighted linear form \u2211 i z_i beyond the trivial tr(WM) = 0. To make progress, we need identities that genuinely depend on the index positions. Two concrete directions:\\n\\n1) s_k := l^T M^k u.\\n- Note s_k = 0 for all k \u2265 n under nilpotency. We already have s_1 = \u2211 i z_i \u2212 (n\u22121) (hence s_1 = \u2212(n\u22121) under the constraint). Compute s_{n}, s_{n+1}, s_{n+2}, s_{n+3} by path expansions that carry the u-weights through the walk. The one-U/two-Z sector at k = n+3 should produce a nontrivial index-weighted linear combination of the z_i and their products that cannot be recast purely in symmetric sums plus endpoint corrections.\\n- Alternatively, exploit the similarity M_t = Z + e^{\u2212t} L \u2212 e^{t} U and observe that s_k(t) = l^T M_t^k u is a polynomial in e^{\u00b1t}. Under nilpotency, s_k(0) = 0 for k \u2265 n; differentiating in t at 0 isolates contributions weighted by the counts of L and U in the words, thus injecting index-dependence in a controlled manner.\\n\\n2) Traces with W: tr(W M^r).\\n- Compute tr(W M^2) = \u2211 i z_i^2 \u2212 (n^2 \u2212 1) (already in the notes). Extend to tr(W M^3), tr(W M^4) explicitly using A := L \u2212 U. These expressions mix z_i^k with weighted boundary and adjacency terms and directly involve the linear weight W. Under nilpotency (which forces tr(M^r) = 0), the constraints tr(W M^r) = explicit constants are extra and can potentially contradict the weighted diagonal condition \u2211 i z_i = 0 once combined with tr(M^2) = tr(M^3) = tr(M^4) = 0.\\n\\nBoth calculations are auditable and testable on n \u2264 6 to ensure correctness before attempting a general proof.\\n\\n## Small example check (n = 3)\\n\\n- Verified: (M^5)_{3,1} = h_3(z_1,z_2,z_3) \u2212 [(n+1)\u2211 z_i \u2212 (z_1 + z_3)] with n = 3 gives h_3 \u2212 [4(z_1 + z_2 + z_3) \u2212 (z_1 + z_3)] = h_3 \u2212 (3 z_1 + 4 z_2 + 3 z_3). Direct enumeration confirms the one-U/one-Z coefficients (3,4,3), matching the general formula.\\n- Under e_1 = 0, this becomes h_3 + (z_1 + z_3) = 0, equivalent to tr(M^3) = 0. Thus no new information at k = n+2, as expected.\\n\\n## Next steps (specific and checkable)\\n\\n- Provide a rigorous, self-contained proof of the k = n+2 identity with the endpoint coefficients c_1 = c_n = n and interior coefficients c_i = n+1.\\n- Derive tr(W M^3) and tr(W M^4) explicitly (in terms of z_i, z_i z_{i+1}, and boundary terms). Verify for small n, then add to proofs.md.\\n- Compute s_{n+3} = l^T M^{n+3} u via path decomposition (u = 0,1,2 sectors for U) or via the M_t differentiation method. Check independence from tr(M^4) and a_{n,4}.\\n- Unify notation (Z, L, U, A := L \u2212 U, W := diag(1,\u2026,n)) throughout and remove contradictory earlier statements (especially the incorrect h_3 relation and the claim that \u03b1_{n+2} forces z_1 + z_n = 0).\\n- If feasible, include a clean proof for n = 3 (using \u2211 i z_i = 0 and the now-established identities) to illustrate how the weighted constraint can yield a contradiction in a small case.\\n\\nThese adjustments will make the current corpus internally consistent and set up the next round of calculations that actually exploit the weighted sum condition to force a contradiction with nilpotency.\\n\"}",
