However, I've noticed that previous outputs sometimes included citations as part of the summary_md content itself. I think it makes sense to place the citations at the end of the summary_md. So, I'll construct the JSON with the necessary fields while adding citations there to meet the developer's request.",

We verified the continuant recurrence and explicit formulas for a_{k,1..3}; computed boundary entries \u03b1_n, \u03b1_{n+1}, \u03b1_{n+2} with the exact identity (M^{n+2})_{n,1}=h_3\u2212(n+1)e_1+(z_1+z_n) (so under e_1=0 one obtains e_3=\u2212(z_1+z_n)). Low-order traces were derived: tr(M^2), tr(M^3), tr(M^4) and tr(A^4)=6n\u221210. The \u03bb^{n\u22124} coefficient was expressed as c_{n\u22124}=e_4+Q+ C(n\u22122,2) and shown (under nilpotency) to be equivalent to tr(M^4)=0 (hence not independent). New weighted tools were recorded: tr(WM), tr(WM^2), a computed tr(WM^3), a weighted Laplacian identity, and kernel summation-by-parts for v\u2208ker M. Consequences under nilpotency: e_1=0, e_2=\u2212(n\u22121), e_3=\u2212(z_1+z_n). Main gap: none of these identities yet exploit the weighted constraint \u2211 i z_i=0 decisively. Next steps target W-based traces or (M^{n+3})_{n,1} and kernel/peeling methods to force endpoint elimination and an induction.
