Across the n+2 slots for the single Z, level i appears with multiplicity c_i where c_1=c_n=n and c_i=n+1 for 2\u2264i\u2264n\u22121. The contribution is \u2212\u2211 c_i z_i = \u2212[(n+1)\u2211 z_i \u2212 (z_1+z_n)]. Sum the two classes. \u220e\\n\\nProposition 6 (\u03bb^{n\u22124} coefficient via matchings)\\nLet \u0394_n(\u03bb) = det(\u03bb I \u2212 M). Then the coefficient of \u03bb^{n\u22124} is\\nc_{n\u22124} = e_4 + Q + C(n\u22122,2),\\nwith Q = \u2211_{edges e} \u2211_{i<j, i,j \u2209 V(e)} z_i z_j = \u2211_{1\u2264i<j\u2264n} c(i,j) z_i z_j,\\nwhere c(i,j) = (n \u2212 1) \u2212 deg(i) \u2212 deg(j) + 1_{|i\u2212j|=1} and deg(1)=deg(n)=1 while deg(i)=2 for 2\u2264i\u2264n\u22121.\\nEquivalently,\\nQ = (n \u2212 1) e_2 \u2212 e_1 \\n\\\\Big(\\\\sum_{i=1}^n deg(i) z_i\\\\Big) + \\\\sum_{i=1}^n deg(i) z_i^2 + \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n\u22121} z_i z_{i+1}.\\nProof. By the continuant/matching expansion on P_n, to obtain \u03bb^{n\u22124} we must take matchings of size m with n\u22122m\u2265n\u22124, so m\u2208{0,1,2}. Case m=0 contributes e_4. Case m=2 contributes +1 per 2-edge matching, i.e., C(n\u22122,2). Case m=1: pick an edge e and then two z\u2019s among vertices not incident to e, summing over edges gives Q. The closed form for Q follows from the stated c(i,j) and the identity \u2211_{i<j} (deg(i)+deg(j)) z_i z_j = e_1\u2211 deg(i) z_i \u2212 \u2211 deg(i) z_i^2. \u220e\\n\\nLemma 7 (weighted traces)\\nWith W=diag(1,\u2026,n),\\n- tr(W M) = \u2211_{i=1}^n i (M)_{ii} = \u2211_{i=1}^n i z_i.\\n- tr(W M^2) = \u2211_{i=1}^n i z_i^2 \u2212 (n^2 \u2212 1).\\n- tr(W M^3) = \u2211_{i=1}^n i z_i^3 \u2212 6\\\\sum_{i=2}^{n\u22121} i z_i \u2212 4 z_1 \u2212 (3n \u2212 1) z_n.\\nProof. tr(WM)=\u2211 i M_{ii}. For tr(WM^2), (M^2)_{ii} = z_i^2 + (S^2)_{ii} with \u2211 i i (S^2)_{ii} = \u2212[(2+\u22ef+n) + (1+\u22ef+n\u22121)] = \u2212(n^2\u22121). For tr(WM^3), expand (Z+S)^3: one-S terms and S^3 have zero diagonal. On the diagonal, (Z S^2 + S^2 Z) contributes 2 z_i (S^2)_{ii}; (S Z S) contributes \u2212(z_{i\u22121}+z_{i+1}). Multiply by i and sum to obtain the stated formula. \u220e\\n\\nLemma 8 (commutator identity with L)\\nFor all k \u2265 1,\\n(M^{k\u22121})_{11} \u2212 (M^{k\u22121})_{nn} + \u2211_{i=1}^{n\u22121} (z_i \u2212 z_{i+1}) (M^{k\u22121})_{i,i+1} = 0.\\nProof. Since tr([L,M] M^{k\u22121}) = 0 and [L,M] = [L,Z] + E_{11} \u2212 E_{nn} with ([L,Z])_{i+1,i} = z_i \u2212 z_{i+1}, we have\\n0 = tr([L,Z] M^{k\u22121}) + (M^{k\u22121})_{11} \u2212 (M^{k\u22121})_{nn} = \u2211_{i=1}^{n\u22121} (z_i \u2212 z_{i+1}) (M^{k\u22121})_{i,i+1} + (M^{k\u22121})_{11} \u2212 (M^{k\u22121})_{nn}. \u220e\"},\"output_update\":null}",
