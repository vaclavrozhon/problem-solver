We corrected and consolidated key identities: exact α_{n+2} (no weighted term), tr(A^4)=6n−10, tr(M^4) explicit, and rigorous weighted traces tr(WM^2)=∑ i i z_i^2−(n^2−1), tr(WM^3)=∑ i i z_i^3 − 6∑_{2..n−1} i z_i − 4 z_1 − (3n−1) z_n. We formalized c_{n−4}=e_4+Q+C(n−2,2) with correct edge-avoidance counts and a compact regrouping. Main gap: no decisive use of ∑ i z_i=0 yet. Next: eliminate e_4 and A via c_{n−4}=0 and tr(M^4)=0, then use weighted traces to force endpoint vanishing and peel by induction.
