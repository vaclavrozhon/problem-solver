S^2 has diagonal −1 at i=1,n and −2 otherwise, and ones on second off-diagonals.

For m=n: paths from 1 to n of length n use exactly n−1 L’s and one Z at a visited vertex, yielding ∑ z_i. For m=n+1: either two Z and n−1 L (contributing h_2), or one U and n L; U cannot be first/last, so there are n−1 valid placements, each contributing −1. ∎\n\nProposition 5 (boundary entry at k = n+2)\nFor n ≥ 2,\n(M^{n+2})_{n,1} = h_3(z) − (n+1)∑_{i=1}^n z_i + (z_1 + z_n).\nProof. Split by number of U’s. If u=0, the monotone path has n−1 L and 3 Z at visited vertices, contributing h_3. If u=1, the skeleton is L^{a−1} U L^{n+1−a} with 2≤a≤n.

By the continuant/matching expansion on P_n, to obtain λ^{n−4} we must take matchings of size m with n−2m≥n−4, so m∈{0,1,2}. Case m=0 contributes e_4. Case m=2 contributes +1 per 2-edge matching, i.e., C(n−2,2). Case m=1: pick an edge e and then two z’s among vertices not incident to e, summing over edges gives Q.

On the diagonal, (Z S^2 + S^2 Z) contributes 2 z_i (S^2)_{ii}; (S Z S) contributes −(z_{i−1}+z_{i+1}).
