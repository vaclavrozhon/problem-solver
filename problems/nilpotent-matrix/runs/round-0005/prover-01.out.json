  "content": "Ideas and quick audit\n\n- The backbone of identities is now consistent, but two summaries still incorrectly conclude z_1 + z_n = 0 from nilpotency. The correct nilpotent consequence (with e_1=\u2211 z_i=0) is e_3 = \u2212(z_1 + z_n). Please fix all summaries to reflect this; \u03b1_{n+2}=0 is redundant with a_{n,3}=0 and does not force z_1+z_n=0.\n- The \u03bb^{n\u22124} coefficient c_{n\u22124} should be used with caution: under nilpotency, by Newton identities with p_k = tr(M^k) = 0 one has e_4 = \u2212p_4/4, so c_{n\u22124}=0 is equivalent to tr(M^4)=0; it therefore adds no independent information beyond tr(M^4)=0. This dependence should be stated explicitly.\n- The weighted constraint \u2211 i z_i = 0 is not yet exploited decisively. Weighted traces are the natural vehicle for it; tr(WM)=0 is the constraint, and higher tr(WM^r) produce additional, genuinely weighted identities.\n\nNew rigorous result: weighted fourth trace\n\nLet M = Z + S with Z = diag(z_1,\u2026,z_n), S = L \u2212 U, and W = diag(1,\u2026,n). Then\n\nTheorem (explicit formula for tr(W M^4)). For every n \u2265 2,\ntr(W M^4) = \u2211_{i=1}^n i z_i^4 \u2212 6 z_1^2 \u2212 6 n z_n^2 \u2212 12 \u2211_{i=2}^{n\u22121} i z_i^2 \u2212 4 \u2211_{i=1}^{n\u22121} (2 i + 1) z_i z_{i+1} + (3 n^2 \u2212 2 n \u2212 5).\n\nProof. Expand (Z + S)^4 and observe that terms with an odd number of S\u2019s contribute zero to the diagonal even after weighting by W: (i) WZ^3S and WS^3 have zero diagonal because S has zero diagonal, and S^3 has zero diagonal by bipartiteness of S. Hence\ntr(W M^4) = tr(W Z^4) + 6 tr(W Z^2 S^2) + 4 tr(W Z S Z S) + tr(W S^4).\nWe compute each term explicitly.\n- tr(W Z^4) = \u2211 i i z_i^4.\n- tr(W Z^2 S^2) = \u2211 i i z_i^2 (S^2)_{ii}. Since (S^2)_{11}=(S^2)_{nn}=\u22121 and (S^2)_{ii}=\u22122 for 2\u2264i\u2264n\u22121, this equals \u2212[z_1^2 + n z_n^2 + 2 \u2211_{i=2}^{n\u22121} i z_i^2]. Thus 6 tr(W Z^2 S^2) = \u22126 z_1^2 \u2212 6 n z_n^2 \u2212 12 \u2211_{i=2}^{n\u22121} i z_i^2.\n- tr(W Z S Z S) = \u2211_{i,j} i z_i S_{i j} z_j S_{j i}. Only j = i\u00b11 contribute. Using S_{i,i+1} = \u22121, S_{i+1,i} = 1, and S_{i,i\u22121} = 1, S_{i\u22121,i} = \u22121, we get\n  tr(W Z S Z S) = \u2212\u2211_{i=1}^{n\u22121} [i z_i z_{i+1} + (i+1) z_{i+1} z_i] = \u2212\u2211_{i=1}^{n\u22121} (2 i + 1) z_i z_{i+1}.\n  Hence 4 tr(W Z S Z S) = \u22124 \u2211_{i=1}^{n\u22121} (2 i + 1) z_i z_{i+1}.\n- tr(W S^4) = \u2211 i i (S^4)_{ii}. The diagonal of S^4 equals 2 at i=1,n; 5 at i=2,n\u22121; and 6 for 3\u2264i\u2264n\u22122 (n\u22654). Summing gives tr(W S^4) = 3 n^2 \u2212 2 n \u2212 5 (valid for all n \u2265 3; for n=2 the formula also holds by direct check). Combining the four contributions yields the claimed identity. \u220e\n\nSanity checks\n\n- For n=3 and z = 0, tr(W S^4) = 16; the formula gives 3\u00b79 \u2212 6 \u2212 5 = 16.\n- For n=4 and z = 0, the formula yields 3\u00b716 \u2212 8 \u2212 5 = 35; direct computation gives weighted diagonal 2,5,5,2 summing to 35.\n\nFurther clarifications and small fixes\n\n- Boundary entry at k = n+2: The correct identity is (M^{n+2})_{n,1} = h_3(z) \u2212 (n+1)\u2211 z_i + (z_1 + z_n). Under \u2211 z_i=0 this reads (M^{n+2})_{n,1} = e_3 + (z_1 + z_n). Setting it to 0 (by nilpotency) gives e_3 = \u2212(z_1 + z_n), consistent with a_{n,3}=0; no further conclusion.\n- Weighted quadratic trace: tr(W M^2) = \u2211 i i z_i^2 \u2212 (n^2 \u2212 1). This can be used together with tr(M^2)=0 (nilpotency) to normalize the weighted second moment: \u2211 i i z_i^2 = n^2 \u2212 1.\n- Weighted cubic trace (already in notes): tr(W M^3) = \u2211 i i z_i^3 \u2212 6\u2211_{i=2}^{n\u22121} i z_i \u2212 4 z_1 \u2212 (3 n \u2212 1) z_n. This is the first higher-order identity that truly encodes the weight vector.\n\nObstacles\n\n- Coefficient identities a_{n,k} and boundary entries \u03b1_{n+q} do not encode index weights; they cannot use \u2211 i z_i = 0 by themselves. Commutator identities with L (or J) yield tautologies for small k. New weighted identities at order 4 (proved above) increase algebraic leverage but do not by themselves vanish under nilpotency.\n\nNext steps (auditable)\n\n- Combine tr(M^4)=0 (unweighted) with tr(W M^4) (weighted) to eliminate the adjacent-product sum A := \u2211 z_i z_{i+1} and express a weighted combination of z_1,z_n and the interior weighted squares in terms of known constants. Use also e_1=0, e_2=\u2212(n\u22121), e_3=\u2212(z_1+z_n), and tr(W M^2) to solve for z_1+z_n and A. Check for contradictions or forced endpoint vanishing for general n, and validate explicitly for n=4,5.\n- Derive and record the kernel summation-by-parts identities (not yet in the consolidated notes): for v \u2208 ker M, \u2211 z_i v_i^2 = 0 and \u2211 i i z_i v_i^2 = \u2212\u2211 v_i v_{i+1}. These connect the weight to the geometry of kernel vectors and may yield obstructions when combined with e_2 = \u2212(n\u22121).\n- Optionally compute tr(W M^4) for n=4,5 symbolically against computational checks to validate the formula and test the elimination scheme. If needed, compute tr(W M^5) to introduce odd-degree weighted power sums and additional endpoint constraints.\n\nWhat to change in the writeup now\n\n- Remove claims that nilpotency implies z_1+z_n = 0; replace with e_3 = \u2212(z_1+z_n).\n- Insert the new theorem (explicit tr(W M^4)) with proof and the explicit value tr(W S^4) = 3 n^2 \u2212 2 n \u2212 5.\n- Clarify that c_{n\u22124}=0 is equivalent to tr(M^4)=0 under nilpotency, hence not independent.\n- Keep both general and nilpotent-specialized forms of tr(M^3) clearly separated to avoid confusion.\n\nThese corrections and additions make the current development internally consistent and add a substantial new, testable weighted identity at order 4 for use in the endpoint-elimination strategy."
