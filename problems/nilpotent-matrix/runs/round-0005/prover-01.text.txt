Ideas and quick audit

- The backbone of identities is now consistent, but two summaries still incorrectly conclude z_1 + z_n = 0 from nilpotency. The correct nilpotent consequence (with e_1=∑ z_i=0) is e_3 = −(z_1 + z_n). Please fix all summaries to reflect this; α_{n+2}=0 is redundant with a_{n,3}=0 and does not force z_1+z_n=0.
- The λ^{n−4} coefficient c_{n−4} should be used with caution: under nilpotency, by Newton identities with p_k = tr(M^k) = 0 one has e_4 = −p_4/4, so c_{n−4}=0 is equivalent to tr(M^4)=0; it therefore adds no independent information beyond tr(M^4)=0. This dependence should be stated explicitly.
- The weighted constraint ∑ i z_i = 0 is not yet exploited decisively. Weighted traces are the natural vehicle for it; tr(WM)=0 is the constraint, and higher tr(WM^r) produce additional, genuinely weighted identities.

New rigorous result: weighted fourth trace

Let M = Z + S with Z = diag(z_1,…,z_n), S = L − U, and W = diag(1,…,n). Then

Theorem (explicit formula for tr(W M^4)). For every n ≥ 2,
tr(W M^4) = ∑_{i=1}^n i z_i^4 − 6 z_1^2 − 6 n z_n^2 − 12 ∑_{i=2}^{n−1} i z_i^2 − 4 ∑_{i=1}^{n−1} (2 i + 1) z_i z_{i+1} + (3 n^2 − 2 n − 5).

Proof. Expand (Z + S)^4 and observe that terms with an odd number of S’s contribute zero to the diagonal even after weighting by W: (i) WZ^3S and WS^3 have zero diagonal because S has zero diagonal, and S^3 has zero diagonal by bipartiteness of S. Hence
tr(W M^4) = tr(W Z^4) + 6 tr(W Z^2 S^2) + 4 tr(W Z S Z S) + tr(W S^4).
We compute each term explicitly.
- tr(W Z^4) = ∑ i i z_i^4.
- tr(W Z^2 S^2) = ∑ i i z_i^2 (S^2)_{ii}. Since (S^2)_{11}=(S^2)_{nn}=−1 and (S^2)_{ii}=−2 for 2≤i≤n−1, this equals −[z_1^2 + n z_n^2 + 2 ∑_{i=2}^{n−1} i z_i^2]. Thus 6 tr(W Z^2 S^2) = −6 z_1^2 − 6 n z_n^2 − 12 ∑_{i=2}^{n−1} i z_i^2.
- tr(W Z S Z S) = ∑_{i,j} i z_i S_{i j} z_j S_{j i}. Only j = i±1 contribute. Using S_{i,i+1} = −1, S_{i+1,i} = 1, and S_{i,i−1} = 1, S_{i−1,i} = −1, we get
  tr(W Z S Z S) = −∑_{i=1}^{n−1} [i z_i z_{i+1} + (i+1) z_{i+1} z_i] = −∑_{i=1}^{n−1} (2 i + 1) z_i z_{i+1}.
  Hence 4 tr(W Z S Z S) = −4 ∑_{i=1}^{n−1} (2 i + 1) z_i z_{i+1}.
- tr(W S^4) = ∑ i i (S^4)_{ii}. The diagonal of S^4 equals 2 at i=1,n; 5 at i=2,n−1; and 6 for 3≤i≤n−2 (n≥4). Summing gives tr(W S^4) = 3 n^2 − 2 n − 5 (valid for all n ≥ 3; for n=2 the formula also holds by direct check). Combining the four contributions yields the claimed identity. ∎

Sanity checks

- For n=3 and z = 0, tr(W S^4) = 16; the formula gives 3·9 − 6 − 5 = 16.
- For n=4 and z = 0, the formula yields 3·16 − 8 − 5 = 35; direct computation gives weighted diagonal 2,5,5,2 summing to 35.

Further clarifications and small fixes

- Boundary entry at k = n+2: The correct identity is (M^{n+2})_{n,1} = h_3(z) − (n+1)∑ z_i + (z_1 + z_n). Under ∑ z_i=0 this reads (M^{n+2})_{n,1} = e_3 + (z_1 + z_n). Setting it to 0 (by nilpotency) gives e_3 = −(z_1 + z_n), consistent with a_{n,3}=0; no further conclusion.
- Weighted quadratic trace: tr(W M^2) = ∑ i i z_i^2 − (n^2 − 1). This can be used together with tr(M^2)=0 (nilpotency) to normalize the weighted second moment: ∑ i i z_i^2 = n^2 − 1.
- Weighted cubic trace (already in notes): tr(W M^3) = ∑ i i z_i^3 − 6∑_{i=2}^{n−1} i z_i − 4 z_1 − (3 n − 1) z_n. This is the first higher-order identity that truly encodes the weight vector.

Obstacles

- Coefficient identities a_{n,k} and boundary entries α_{n+q} do not encode index weights; they cannot use ∑ i z_i = 0 by themselves. Commutator identities with L (or J) yield tautologies for small k. New weighted identities at order 4 (proved above) increase algebraic leverage but do not by themselves vanish under nilpotency.

Next steps (auditable)

- Combine tr(M^4)=0 (unweighted) with tr(W M^4) (weighted) to eliminate the adjacent-product sum A := ∑ z_i z_{i+1} and express a weighted combination of z_1,z_n and the interior weighted squares in terms of known constants. Use also e_1=0, e_2=−(n−1), e_3=−(z_1+z_n), and tr(W M^2) to solve for z_1+z_n and A. Check for contradictions or forced endpoint vanishing for general n, and validate explicitly for n=4,5.
- Derive and record the kernel summation-by-parts identities (not yet in the consolidated notes): for v ∈ ker M, ∑ z_i v_i^2 = 0 and ∑ i i z_i v_i^2 = −∑ v_i v_{i+1}. These connect the weight to the geometry of kernel vectors and may yield obstructions when combined with e_2 = −(n−1).
- Optionally compute tr(W M^4) for n=4,5 symbolically against computational checks to validate the formula and test the elimination scheme. If needed, compute tr(W M^5) to introduce odd-degree weighted power sums and additional endpoint constraints.

What to change in the writeup now

- Remove claims that nilpotency implies z_1+z_n = 0; replace with e_3 = −(z_1+z_n).
- Insert the new theorem (explicit tr(W M^4)) with proof and the explicit value tr(W S^4) = 3 n^2 − 2 n − 5.
- Clarify that c_{n−4}=0 is equivalent to tr(M^4)=0 under nilpotency, hence not independent.
- Keep both general and nilpotent-specialized forms of tr(M^3) clearly separated to avoid confusion.

These corrections and additions make the current development internally consistent and add a substantial new, testable weighted identity at order 4 for use in the endpoint-elimination strategy.
