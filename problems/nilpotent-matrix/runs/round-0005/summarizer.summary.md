This round corrected and consolidated structural identities for the family M = Z + L − U. We verified the continuant recurrence and explicit a_{k,1..3}; computed boundary entries α_n, α_{n+1}, α_{n+2} with the exact formula (M^{n+2})_{n,1}=h_3−(n+1)e_1+(z_1+z_n) (so under e_1=0 one gets e_3=−(z_1+z_n) but not z_1+z_n=0). Low-order traces were derived (tr(M^2), tr(M^3), tr(M^4)) and tr(A^4)=6n−10. The λ^{n−4} coefficient was written c_{n−4}=e_4+Q+C(n−2,2) and shown (under nilpotency) to be equivalent to tr(M^4)=0 (hence not independent). New weighted tools were recorded: tr(WM), tr(WM^2), tr(WM^3), a weighted Laplacian identity and kernel summation-by-parts for v∈ker M. Main remaining gap: none of the identities yet exploit the weighted constraint ∑ i z_i=0 decisively. Next work should target W-based traces or (M^{n+3})_{n,1} and kernel/peeling methods to force endpoint elimination and an induction. Citations: proofs.md; Research Notes (corrected & consolidated).
