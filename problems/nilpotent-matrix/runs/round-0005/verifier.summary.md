Core identities are now correct: continuant coefficients a_{k,1..3}, tr(M^2), tr(M^3), tr(A^4)=6n−10, tr(M^4), and boundary entries up to k=n+2. The λ^{n−4} coefficient formula with correct edge-avoidance regrouping is established. Weighted traces tr(WM^2), tr(WM^3), and a consistent tr(WM^4) have been derived. However, no complete contradiction yet: c_{n−4}=0 is not independent, and α_{n+2} does not imply z_1+z_n=0. Next: combine tr(M^4) with tr(WM^4) and weighted moments that must vanish (e.g., s_k) to isolate endpoints and perform an inductive peeling.
