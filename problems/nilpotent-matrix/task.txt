Let M be a tridiagonal matrix with complex numbers z_1, z_2, ..., z_n on diagonal, all entries right below the main diagonal are 1 and all entries right above are -1, e.g.

z_1 -1   0
1    z_2 -1
0   1       z_3

Furthermore, the numbers on diagonal satisfy linear condition
z_1 + 2 z_2 + 3z_3 + ... n z_n =0.

Prove that there is no nilpotent matrix of this form.

It has been checked computationally that the conjecture holds for n <= 5.
