  "summary_md": "In Round 0001, significant refinements and clarifications were made regarding the lemmas and strategies for sorting pancakes. Lemma 1 was refined to ensure the largest pancake in a sorted subset does not disrupt the overall order, while Lemma 2 was clarified to define a systematic approach for generating compound cases. An alternative heuristic based on counting inversions was proposed, though it requires further validation. The exploration of compound cases through prefix flips was discussed, emphasizing the need for a structured approach to avoid redundancy. Additionally, a parallel processing strategy was introduced, highlighting the importance of independent batch processing to prevent conflicts.",
