  "feedback_md": "The latest round presents some refinements and clarifications, but significant gaps remain in the rigor and justification of the claims. For Lemma 1, while the refinement emphasizes the importance of the largest pancake in the subset, it still lacks a formal proof or counterexamples that demonstrate the necessity of this condition. A counterexample could be a stack like [4, 1, 2, 3], where sorting [4, 1] does not help. Lemma 2's clarification on generating compound cases is a step forward, but it still requires a more precise definition of 'systematic' to ensure that the combinations yield genuinely new insights. The alternative heuristic based on inversions is a valid approach, yet it needs empirical validation to confirm its effectiveness compared to simpler heuristics. The exploration of compound cases is promising, but the method of generating configurations should be more structured to avoid redundancy. Lastly, the parallel processing strategy is a good idea, but it needs a detailed implementation plan to manage complexity effectively. Overall, while there are valuable insights, the claims need more rigorous support and clearer definitions.",
