• Lemma 1 needs a formal proof or counterexamples to justify the sorting of subsets.
• Lemma 2 requires a precise definition of 'systematic' for generating compound cases.
• Alternative Heuristic 1 based on inversions is valid but needs empirical validation.
• Exploration of compound cases should be more structured to avoid redundancy.
• Parallel processing strategy needs a detailed implementation plan.
