Pancake sorting is the following problem. We are given given a stack of $n$ pancakes numbered $1$ to $n$. Our task is to sort them so that they are order $1, 2, \dots, n$. Allowed operation is to take a prefix of the pancakes and flip it; that is, we can turn a sequence $p_1, \dots, p_n$ to $p_i, p_{i-1}, \dots, p_1, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_n$ for any $1 \le i \le n$. 

I am interested in how quickly we can sort $n$ pancakes, in the worst case. In the paper [1], the authors constructed an algorithm that sorts any sequence of $n$ pancakes in time $1.67n + o(n)$. This was improved in paper [2] to $1.64n + o(n)$. 

The approach of [2] is to start with *cases* from [1] and construct so called *compound cases*. Then, one can run a bruteforce algorithm that analyses more and more compound cases automatically, until a better solution is found (hopefully). 

I want you to take the approach of [2] and improve it as many way possible as you can. The end result should be an algorithm that gives us the best shot of improving the bound from [2] further. This should include fast and smart generating of new compound cases, as well as a fast algorithm finding the shortest solution for each case (e.g. using A* search with a reasonable heuristic function).
