For the Habiro ring \\\\(\\\\mathbb Z[[q]]^{\\\\mathbb N}=\\\\widehat{\\\\mathbb Z[q]}\\\\) (i.e. \\\\(\\\\ZqN\\\\) in the paper), the unit group is\\n\\\\[\\nU(\\\\ZqN)=\\\\{\\\\pm q^i\\\\mid i\\\\in\\\\mathbb Z\\\\}.\\n\\\\]\\n\\nWhy useful. A complete description of units would give strong rigidity for Habiro\u2019s \\\"holomorphic functions on roots of unity\\\", and is used implicitly whenever normalizing universal series (e.g. 3\u2013manifold invariants) up to trivial units.\\n\\n\\nIdeas\\n- Units must be units in every local expansion: if \\\\(u\\\\in U(\\\\ZqN)\\\\), then for every root of unity \\\\(\\\\zeta\\\\), its image \\\\(u(\\\\zeta)\\\\in U(\\\\mathbb Z[\\\\zeta])\\\\), and its expansion in \\\\(\\\\mathbb Z[\\\\zeta][[q-\\\\zeta]]\\\\) has invertible constant term.\\n- The map to values at infinitely many prime-power roots of unity is injective (Theorem 6.3/6.4 of the paper). Thus if a unit agrees with \\\\(\\\\pm q^i\\\\) at infinitely many such roots, it must equal \\\\(\\\\pm q^i\\\\) in \\\\(\\\\ZqN\\\\).\\n- At \\\\(q=1\\\\) and \\\\(q=-1\\\\) we get immediate constraints: \\\\(u(1),u(-1)\\\\in\\\\{\\\\pm1\\\\}\\\\). This quickly discards many natural candidates (e.g. \u201calternating units\u201d \\\\(\\\\gamma_m=\\\\sum_{i=0}^{m-1}(-1)^iq^i\\\\) satisfy \\\\(\\\\gamma_m(-1)=m\\\\), so are not units in \\\\(\\\\ZqN\\\\)).\\n\\n\\nProved special cases\\n1) Torsion units are trivial.\\n- Claim. If \\\\(u\\\\in \\\\ZqN\\\\) and \\\\(u^m=1\\\\) for some \\\\(m\\\\ge1\\\\), then \\\\(u=\\\\pm1\\\\).\\n- Proof. Inject \\\\(\\\\ZqN\\\\hookrightarrow \\\\mathbb Z[[q-1]]\\\\). In characteristic 0, \\\\(\\\\mathbb Q[[q-1]]\\\\) has no nontrivial torsion, so the only solutions to \\\\(u^m=1\\\\) in \\\\(\\\\mathbb Z[[q-1]]\\\\) are \\\\(\\\\pm1\\\\). Hence in \\\\(\\\\ZqN\\\\) the only torsion units are \\\\(\\\\pm1\\\\).\\n\\n2) Rigidification by infinite exact matches.\\n- Proposition. If \\\\(u\\\\in U(\\\\ZqN)\\\\) and there exist \\\\(i\\\\in\\\\mathbb Z\\\\) and infinitely many roots of unity \\\\(\\\\zeta\\\\) of prime-power order with \\\\(u(\\\\zeta)=\\\\pm\\\\zeta^i\\\\), then \\\\(u=\\\\pm q^i\\\\).\\n- Proof. Let \\\\(T\\\\) be the infinite set of their orders. By Theorem 6.3 (Theorem 3 in the paper), \\\\(\\\\tau^{\\\\mathbb Z}_{\\\\mathbb N,T}\\\\) is injective. The ratio \\\\(w=\\\\pm q^{-i}u\\\\) maps to 1 in \\\\(\\\\prod_{n\\\\in T}\\\\mathbb Z[q]/(\\\\Phi_n)\\\\), hence \\\\(w=1\\\\), i.e., \\\\(u=\\\\pm q^i\\\\).\\n\\n3) Polynomial/Laurent polynomial case.\\n- If \\\\(u\\\\in U(\\\\ZqN)\\\\cap \\\\mathbb Z[q,q^{-1}]\\\\), then \\\\(u\\\\in\\\\{\\\\pm q^i\\\\}\\\\). This follows from \\\\(U(\\\\mathbb Z[q,q^{-1}])=\\\\{\\\\pm q^i\\\\}\\\\) and the inclusion \\\\(\\\\mathbb Z[q,q^{-1}]\\\\hookrightarrow \\\\ZqN\\\\).\\n\\n\\np-adic congruences (useful constraints)\\n- Lemma. If \\\\(u\\\\in U(\\\\ZqN)\\\\), then for any odd prime \\\\(p\\\\) and any primitive \\\\(p^a\\\\)-th root \\\\(\\\\zeta\\\\), one has \\\\(u(\\\\zeta)\\\\equiv u(1)\\\\pmod{p}\\\\).\\n- Proof. Expand \\\\(u\\\\) in \\\\(\\\\mathbb Z[[q-1]]\\\\): \\\\(u(q)=s+\\\\sum_{k\\\\ge1} c_k(q-1)^k\\\\) with \\\\(s=\\\\pm1\\\\). For \\\\(\\\\zeta\\\\) of \\\\(p\\\\)-power order, \\\\(\\\\zeta\\\\equiv1\\\\pmod p\\\\) in \\\\(\\\\mathbb Z_p[\\\\zeta]\\\\), hence \\\\(u(\\\\zeta)\\\\equiv s\\\\pmod p\\\\).\\n- Corollary. For each odd \\\\(p\\\\), the \\\"sign part\\\" of \\\\(u(\\\\zeta)\\\\) on \\\\(\\\\mu_{p^{\\\\infty}}\\\\) is constant (equal to \\\\(u(1)=\\\\pm1\\\\)).\\n\\nThese congruences suggest that on each pro-\\\\(p\\\\) torsion subgroup \\\\(\\\\mu_{p^{\\\\infty}}\\\\), a unit \\\\(u\\\\) is p-adically close to a monomial \\\\(\\\\pm q^i\\\\) (matching first-order terms in \\\\(q-1\\\\)). This supports the strategy below.\\n\\n\\nObstacles\\n- Turning \\\"p-adic closeness\\\" to exact equality at infinitely many \\\\(p^a\\\\)-th roots requires a nontrivial lifting argument; the usual p-adic logarithm vanishes on \\\\(\\\\mu_{p^{\\\\infty}}\\\\), so direct linearization fails.\\n- Values \\\\(u(\\\\zeta)\\\\) live in \\\\(\\\\mathbb Z[\\\\zeta]^\\\\times\\\\), whose unit ranks are large for most \\\\(\\\\zeta\\\\); showing they are constrained to \\\\(\\\\pm\\\\zeta^i\\\\) infinitely often needs a diophantine/torsion-point input (e.g. results \u00e0 la Lang\u2013Zannier on functions mapping torsion points to torsion).\\n\\n\\nExamples/tests\\n- Alternating sums \\\\(\\\\gamma_m=\\\\sum_{i=0}^{m-1}(-1)^i q^i\\\\) (odd \\\\(m\\\\)) are units in many finite quotients \\\\(\\\\mathbb Z[q]/(q^n-1)\\\\) with \\\\((n,2m)=1\\\\), but not units in \\\\(\\\\ZqN\\\\), since \\\\(\\\\gamma_m(-1)=m\\\\notin\\\\{\\\\pm1\\\\}\\\\).\\n- For small quotients \\\\(\\\\mathbb Z[q]/((q)_n)\\\\) (e.g., \\\\(n\\\\le5\\\\)), a computer check can enumerate units and compare their lifts; initial data appears consistent with Conjecture 7.2 (no surprises beyond \\\\(\\\\pm q^i\\\\)).\\n\\n\\nNext steps\\n- p-adic rigidity along \\\\(\\\\mu_{p^{\\\\infty}}\\\\): Show that for fixed odd \\\\(p\\\\) there exists \\\\(i_p\\\\in\\\\mathbb Z\\\\) with \\\\(u(\\\\zeta)=\\\\pm\\\\zeta^{i_p}\\\\) for infinitely many \\\\(\\\\zeta\\\\in\\\\mu_{p^{\\\\infty}}\\\\). Combining two primes and Chinese remaindering would then yield a global \\\\(i\\\\) and finish by the injectivity result above.\\n- Use diophantine tools: seek an application of torsion-point results on \\\\(\\\\mathbb G_m\\\\) (e.g. Zannier-type theorems) to functions in the Habiro ring, viewed as uniform limits of polynomials, to force torsion values along infinite torsion sets.\\n- Computational: search for nontrivial units numerically in \\\\(\\\\mathbb Z[q]/((q)_n)\\\\) for growing \\\\(n\\\\), check whether any consistent family other than \\\\(\\\\pm q^i\\\\) can survive the inverse limit.\\n\\n\\nSummary of progress\\n- Proved torsion-units triviality and a rigidity lemma that reduces the conjecture to producing infinitely many exact matches with a monomial at prime-power orders.\\n- Established uniform p-adic congruence constraints on \\\\(u(\\\\zeta)\\\\) along \\\\(\\\\mu_{p^{\\\\infty}}\\\\).\\n- Eliminated a natural family of candidates (alternating sums), and outlined a concrete plan leveraging Theorem 6.3\u2019s injectivity plus p-adic analysis to conclude.\\n\"\n}",
