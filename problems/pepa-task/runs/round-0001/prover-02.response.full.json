Please provide the precise statement of Conjecture 7.2.\\n- Pending clarification, I outline progress on two natural candidates that appear as conjectures in the included paper:\\n  (A) Injectivity by values at roots of unity for any infinite set (Conjecture 5 in the paper): For any infinite Z \u2282 \u03bc\u221e, the evaluation map \u03c4Z: Z\u0302[q] \u2192 \u220f\u03b6\u2208Z Z[\u03b6] is injective.\\n  (B) Units in Z\u0302[q] (Conjecture 7 in the paper): U(Z\u0302[q]) = {\u00b1qk | k \u2208 Z}.\\n\\nCandidate A: Injectivity for arbitrary infinite Z\\nWhy relevant: The task \u201cprove or disprove conjecture 7.2\u201d plausibly points to an injectivity statement; Conjecture 5 is highlighted in the paper as open.\\n\\nKnown tools\\n- Theorem (Habiro): If Z contains infinitely many roots whose orders include infinitely many prime powers (or, more generally, Theorem 3\u2019s adjacency hypothesis holds), then \u03c4Z is injective.\\n\\nReduction observation (new, simple)\\n- Claim: To establish injectivity for arbitrary infinite Z, it suffices to handle the case where N(Z) intersects each \u201cprime-power ray\u201d {n\u00b7pk | k \u2265 0} in only finitely many points, for every fixed n and prime p.\\n- Why: If N(Z) has infinite intersection with some ray, injectivity follows immediately from Theorem 3 with that base n and prime p. Thus any counterexample must be \u201cray-sparse.\u201d\\n- Usefulness: Focuses attention on the genuinely hard cases where the orders in Z keep introducing new prime factors and never stay on a single prime-power ray.\\n\\nExamples\\n- Z with N(Z) = {squarefree integers} is not ray-sparse (since it contains infinitely many primes), hence Theorem 3 applies with n = 1 and yields injectivity.\\n- Construct ray-sparse examples: For instance, N(Z) = {p1 p2 \u2026 pk : k \u2265 1} (primorial sequence). Here for any fixed n and any prime p, the set {m \u2208 N(Z): m/n is a prime power} is finite (often empty). These are the difficult cases not covered by Theorem 3.\\n\\nObstacle analysis (why Theorem 3 methods do not extend directly)\\n- The proof of Theorem 3 exploits that for m/n = pj, the congruence \u03a6m \u2261 \u03a6n d (mod p) forces divisibility of the \u201cleading\u201d coefficient in Z[q]/(\u03a6n) by infinitely many distinct primes, hence zero. If m/n is not a prime power, this congruence fails: in Fp[q], \u03a6m does not lie in the radical of (\u03a6n), so the same forcing mechanism breaks.\\n- Attempted strengthening via chains n \u2192 n\u00b7p \u2192 \u2026 \u2192 m does not work because one cannot push divisibility back through arbitrary chains without losing control of primes in the necessary ideals.\\n\\nCheckable special cases (recorded towards a possible proof)\\n- Proposition (folklore, immediate from Theorem 3): If Z contains infinitely many orders m each sharing a fixed prime p in the ratio m/n = pj for some fixed n, then \u03c4Z is injective.\\n- Proposition (new packaging of known result): If N(Z) contains infinitely many primes, \u03c4Z is injective (take n = 1). Proof: For infinitely many primes p, \u03a6p \u2208 (p, q \u2212 1); the same p-adic argument as in Theorem 3 applies with n = 1.\\n\\nOpen subproblem (precise, for future attack)\\n- Conjecture (ray-sparse case): If Z is infinite and N(Z) has finite intersection with every ray {n\u00b7pk}, then \u03c4Z is injective.\\n- This is the core missing case for Conjecture 5. A proof would resolve the full conjecture.\\n\\nIdeas for attack\\n- View kernels as projective families: a \u2208 Z\u0302[q] lies in ker \u03c4Z iff its images in R[q]/(\u03a6m) vanish for all m \u2208 N(Z). Constructing a nonzero such a requires a compatible family across all products of these \u03a6m. CRT-type obstructions over Z (as opposed to Q) might preclude nontrivial families if the set of moduli is sufficiently \u201carithmetic independent.\u201d Make this precise.\\n- p-adic separation across varying primes: Even if m/n is not a p-power, for each m pick a prime p|m. Seek a way to force the same leading coefficient in some fixed component to be divisible by infinitely many distinct primes. Current obstruction: modulo p, \u03a6m reduces to a product of powers of \u03a6d with d|m and p\u2224d, not necessarily including \u03a6n. Need a mechanism to tie these back to a fixed n.\\n\\nCandidate B: Units in Z\u0302[q]\\nWhy relevant: This is Conjecture 7 in the paper.\\n\\nPartial constraints on units (simple and checkable)\\n- Proposition: If u \u2208 Z\u0302[q] is a unit, then for each root of unity \u03b6, the constant term of \u03c3\u03b6(u) \u2208 Z[\u03b6][[q \u2212 \u03b6]] is a unit in Z[\u03b6]. In particular, u(\u03b6) \u2208 Z[\u03b6]\u00d7 for all \u03b6. Proof: In any complete local ring A[[x]], a series is invertible iff its constant term is a unit in A; apply Theorem 13 to embed Z\u0302[q] into Z[\u03b6][[q \u2212 \u03b6]].\\n- Corollary: If u \u2208 Z[q, q\u22121] \u2282 Z\u0302[q] is a unit in Z\u0302[q], then u(\u03b6) is a cyclotomic unit in Z[\u03b6] for every \u03b6.\\n\\nObstacles and plan\\n- It is plausible (and conjectured) that only \u00b1qk are such units. A direct route would be to show that a Laurent polynomial taking unit values in Z[\u03b6n] for infinitely many n must be \u00b1qk (a Kronecker-type phenomenon). I do not have a complete proof; this reduces to a deep arithmetic statement about norms of algebraic integers g(\u03b6n).\\n- Negative evidence for nontrivial units comes from alternators \u03b3m = \u2211i=0 m\u22121 (\u22121)i qi: these give units in many finite cyclotomic quotients Z[q]/(qn \u2212 1) with (n, 2m) = 1, but they are not units in Z\u0302[q] because, for primes p|m, their images in Z\u0302\u27e8p\u27e9 fail to be invertible (one can check noninvertibility modulo (\u03a6p, p)). A full proof of noninvertibility in Z\u0302[q] for all \u03b3m (odd m \u2265 3) would be a useful lemma towards Conjecture 7; I plan to write it out carefully next.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Please provide the exact statement of Conjecture 7.2. I will then target special cases/proofs accordingly.\\n- For Conjecture A (injectivity for arbitrary infinite Z):\\n  1) Rigorously prove the \u201cray-sparse reduction\u201d as above, and establish injectivity for classes of ray-sparse sets (e.g., orders with pairwise coprime squarefree kernels of bounded size).\\n  2) Attempt a CRT obstruction in Z: show that a nontrivial compatible system vanishing modulo \u03a6m for all m in a ray-sparse infinite set cannot exist.\\n- For Conjecture B (units):\\n  1) Prove that \u03b3m is not a unit in Z\u0302[q] for odd m \u2265 3 (targeted local analysis modulo \u03a6p, p|m).\\n  2) Seek a Kronecker-type lemma: Laurent polynomials with integral coefficients that are units in Z[\u03b6n] for infinitely many n are monomials \u00b1qk.\\n\\nAll claims above are either immediate corollaries of the paper\u2019s theorems (and I have indicated why) or marked as obstacles/open tasks. I will formalize any requested special-case proof in the next round upon confirmation of the conjecture\u2019s statement.\"\n}",
