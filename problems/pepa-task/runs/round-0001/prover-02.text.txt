Clarification needed
- The statement of Conjecture 7.2 is not present in the provided materials (Notes/Output are empty; the only paper included is Habiro’s “Cyclotomic completions of polynomial rings”). Please provide the precise statement of Conjecture 7.2.
- Pending clarification, I outline progress on two natural candidates that appear as conjectures in the included paper:
  (A) Injectivity by values at roots of unity for any infinite set (Conjecture 5 in the paper): For any infinite Z ⊂ μ∞, the evaluation map τZ: Ẑ[q] → ∏ζ∈Z Z[ζ] is injective.
  (B) Units in Ẑ[q] (Conjecture 7 in the paper): U(Ẑ[q]) = {±qk | k ∈ Z}.

Candidate A: Injectivity for arbitrary infinite Z
Why relevant: The task “prove or disprove conjecture 7.2” plausibly points to an injectivity statement; Conjecture 5 is highlighted in the paper as open.

Known tools
- Theorem (Habiro): If Z contains infinitely many roots whose orders include infinitely many prime powers (or, more generally, Theorem 3’s adjacency hypothesis holds), then τZ is injective.

Reduction observation (new, simple)
- Claim: To establish injectivity for arbitrary infinite Z, it suffices to handle the case where N(Z) intersects each “prime-power ray” {n·pk | k ≥ 0} in only finitely many points, for every fixed n and prime p.
- Why: If N(Z) has infinite intersection with some ray, injectivity follows immediately from Theorem 3 with that base n and prime p. Thus any counterexample must be “ray-sparse.”
- Usefulness: Focuses attention on the genuinely hard cases where the orders in Z keep introducing new prime factors and never stay on a single prime-power ray.

Examples
- Z with N(Z) = {squarefree integers} is not ray-sparse (since it contains infinitely many primes), hence Theorem 3 applies with n = 1 and yields injectivity.
- Construct ray-sparse examples: For instance, N(Z) = {p1 p2 … pk : k ≥ 1} (primorial sequence). Here for any fixed n and any prime p, the set {m ∈ N(Z): m/n is a prime power} is finite (often empty). These are the difficult cases not covered by Theorem 3.

Obstacle analysis (why Theorem 3 methods do not extend directly)
- The proof of Theorem 3 exploits that for m/n = pj, the congruence Φm ≡ Φn d (mod p) forces divisibility of the “leading” coefficient in Z[q]/(Φn) by infinitely many distinct primes, hence zero. If m/n is not a prime power, this congruence fails: in Fp[q], Φm does not lie in the radical of (Φn), so the same forcing mechanism breaks.
- Attempted strengthening via chains n → n·p → … → m does not work because one cannot push divisibility back through arbitrary chains without losing control of primes in the necessary ideals.

Checkable special cases (recorded towards a possible proof)
- Proposition (folklore, immediate from Theorem 3): If Z contains infinitely many orders m each sharing a fixed prime p in the ratio m/n = pj for some fixed n, then τZ is injective.
- Proposition (new packaging of known result): If N(Z) contains infinitely many primes, τZ is injective (take n = 1). Proof: For infinitely many primes p, Φp ∈ (p, q − 1); the same p-adic argument as in Theorem 3 applies with n = 1.

Open subproblem (precise, for future attack)
- Conjecture (ray-sparse case): If Z is infinite and N(Z) has finite intersection with every ray {n·pk}, then τZ is injective.
- This is the core missing case for Conjecture 5. A proof would resolve the full conjecture.

Ideas for attack
- View kernels as projective families: a ∈ Ẑ[q] lies in ker τZ iff its images in R[q]/(Φm) vanish for all m ∈ N(Z). Constructing a nonzero such a requires a compatible family across all products of these Φm. CRT-type obstructions over Z (as opposed to Q) might preclude nontrivial families if the set of moduli is sufficiently “arithmetic independent.” Make this precise.
- p-adic separation across varying primes: Even if m/n is not a p-power, for each m pick a prime p|m. Seek a way to force the same leading coefficient in some fixed component to be divisible by infinitely many distinct primes. Current obstruction: modulo p, Φm reduces to a product of powers of Φd with d|m and p∤d, not necessarily including Φn. Need a mechanism to tie these back to a fixed n.

Candidate B: Units in Ẑ[q]
Why relevant: This is Conjecture 7 in the paper.

Partial constraints on units (simple and checkable)
- Proposition: If u ∈ Ẑ[q] is a unit, then for each root of unity ζ, the constant term of σζ(u) ∈ Z[ζ][[q − ζ]] is a unit in Z[ζ]. In particular, u(ζ) ∈ Z[ζ]× for all ζ. Proof: In any complete local ring A[[x]], a series is invertible iff its constant term is a unit in A; apply Theorem 13 to embed Ẑ[q] into Z[ζ][[q − ζ]].
- Corollary: If u ∈ Z[q, q−1] ⊂ Ẑ[q] is a unit in Ẑ[q], then u(ζ) is a cyclotomic unit in Z[ζ] for every ζ.

Obstacles and plan
- It is plausible (and conjectured) that only ±qk are such units. A direct route would be to show that a Laurent polynomial taking unit values in Z[ζn] for infinitely many n must be ±qk (a Kronecker-type phenomenon). I do not have a complete proof; this reduces to a deep arithmetic statement about norms of algebraic integers g(ζn).
- Negative evidence for nontrivial units comes from alternators γm = ∑i=0 m−1 (−1)i qi: these give units in many finite cyclotomic quotients Z[q]/(qn − 1) with (n, 2m) = 1, but they are not units in Ẑ[q] because, for primes p|m, their images in Ẑ⟨p⟩ fail to be invertible (one can check noninvertibility modulo (Φp, p)). A full proof of noninvertibility in Ẑ[q] for all γm (odd m ≥ 3) would be a useful lemma towards Conjecture 7; I plan to write it out carefully next.

Next steps
- Please provide the exact statement of Conjecture 7.2. I will then target special cases/proofs accordingly.
- For Conjecture A (injectivity for arbitrary infinite Z):
  1) Rigorously prove the “ray-sparse reduction” as above, and establish injectivity for classes of ray-sparse sets (e.g., orders with pairwise coprime squarefree kernels of bounded size).
  2) Attempt a CRT obstruction in Z: show that a nontrivial compatible system vanishing modulo Φm for all m in a ray-sparse infinite set cannot exist.
- For Conjecture B (units):
  1) Prove that γm is not a unit in Ẑ[q] for odd m ≥ 3 (targeted local analysis modulo Φp, p|m).
  2) Seek a Kronecker-type lemma: Laurent polynomials with integral coefficients that are units in Z[ζn] for infinitely many n are monomials ±qk.

All claims above are either immediate corollaries of the paper’s theorems (and I have indicated why) or marked as obstacles/open tasks. I will formalize any requested special-case proof in the next round upon confirmation of the conjecture’s statement.
