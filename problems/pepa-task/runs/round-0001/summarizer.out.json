  "summary_md": "Status: partial progress toward Conjecture 7.2 (units in the Habiro ring Z[q]^N are exactly \u00b1q^i). Proven/established: torsion units are trivial (u^m=1 \u21d2 u=\u00b11); p-adic congruence along \u03bc_{p^\u221e}: for odd p and primitive p^a-th roots \u03b6 one has u(\u03b6) \u2261 u(1) (mod p); a corrected rigidity lemma: if a unit u satisfies u(\u03b6)=\u00b1\u03b6^i for infinitely many roots of prime-power order \u03b6 then u=\u00b1q^i (uses injectivity of \u03c4 over that infinite set). Key caveats: the claim for Laurent-polynomial units is not automatic from inclusion Z[q,q^{-1}]\u2282Z[q]^N; the proposed 'chain injectivity' extension contains a gap. Next steps: settle non-unit of \u03b3_m, prove Laurent-polynomial unit characterization, pursue prime-power rigidity to produce infinitely many exact equalities.
