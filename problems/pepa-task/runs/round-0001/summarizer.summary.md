Status: partial progress toward Conjecture 7.2 (units in the Habiro ring Z[q]^N are exactly ±q^i). Proven/established: torsion units are trivial (u^m=1 ⇒ u=±1); p-adic congruence along μ_{p^∞}: for odd p and primitive p^a-th roots ζ one has u(ζ) ≡ u(1) (mod p); a corrected rigidity lemma: if a unit u satisfies u(ζ)=±ζ^i for infinitely many roots of prime-power order ζ then u=±q^i (uses injectivity of τ over that infinite set). Key caveats: the claim for Laurent-polynomial units is not automatic from inclusion Z[q,q^{-1}]⊂Z[q]^N; the proposed 'chain injectivity' extension contains a gap. Next steps: settle non-unit of γ_m, prove Laurent-polynomial unit characterization, pursue prime-power rigidity to produce infinitely many exact equalities.
