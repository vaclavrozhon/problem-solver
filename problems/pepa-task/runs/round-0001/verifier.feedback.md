Scope and clarification. The statement “Conjecture 7.2” is not present verbatim in the provided excerpt. The two salient conjectures in Habiro’s paper are: (i) injectivity of τ for any infinite set of roots of unity (Conj. 5 in the tex), and (ii) the unit group of the Habiro ring is exactly {±q^i} (Conj. 7 in the tex). Prover 1 worked on the units conjecture; Provers 2–3 focused on injectivity. Please confirm which one is intended by “7.2”. Below I audit accordingly.

Prover 1 (units). Strengths: (a) Torsion units: the argument is correct in spirit; with a clean proof using the injection into Z[[q−1]] and the formal logarithm in Q[[q−1]], one gets u^m=1 ⇒ u=±1. (b) p-adic congruence u(ζ) ≡ u(1) mod p for ζ of p-power order (p odd) is correct. (c) The “rigidity by infinite exact matches” is correct but the proof should use Theorem 2 (τ over an infinite set of roots Z that contains infinitely many of p-power order) rather than Theorem 3 over orders. With Z = {ζ : u(ζ)=±ζ^i}, τ_{N,Z} is injective, so w=±q^{−i}u maps to 1 at all ζ∈Z, hence w=1. Weakness: The claim “if u∈Z[q,q^{-1}] ∩ U(Ẑ[q]) then u∈{±q^i}” is not justified by mere inclusion of rings; it requires a separate argument (e.g., via values at infinitely many ζ or norms). Please remove or prove it.

Prover 2 (injectivity). The “ray-sparse reduction” is a useful framing; the plan to handle prime-order sets and CRT obstructions is coherent. The γ_m non-unit test via reduction modulo (Φ_p, p) is a good concrete next step.

Prover 3 (injectivity). The “chain injectivity” Theorem A’s proof is flawed. The step W_{i+1}=W_i Φ_{m_{i+1}} ≡ p_i(W_i A_i) (mod Φ_n) improperly discards the term W_i(Φ_{m_i}B_i); W_i does not annihilate Φ_{m_i} modulo (Φ_n). Thus the main inductive divisibility claim does not follow. Please retract or substantially fix.

Next steps.
- Confirm the target conjecture (units vs injectivity). If units: formalize the corrected rigidity lemma (using τ over ζ), keep the torsion-units proof, and prove γ_m (odd m≥3) are not units by exhibiting noninvertibility in some Z[q]/(Φ_p,p) with p|m. Then attack the Laurent polynomial case rigorously (e.g., show: if g∈Z[q,q^{-1}] and g(ζ)∈Z[ζ]^× for infinitely many ζ, then g=±q^i).
- If injectivity: focus on the hard “ray-sparse” sets (e.g., prime orders). Try a CRT-based obstruction to nonzero kernels over Z, and avoid the flawed chain argument.
