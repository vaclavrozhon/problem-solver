  "feedback_md": "Scope and clarification. The statement \u201cConjecture 7.2\u201d is not present verbatim in the provided excerpt. The two salient conjectures in Habiro\u2019s paper are: (i) injectivity of \u03c4 for any infinite set of roots of unity (Conj. 5 in the tex), and (ii) the unit group of the Habiro ring is exactly {\u00b1q^i} (Conj. 7 in the tex). Prover 1 worked on the units conjecture; Provers 2\u20133 focused on injectivity. Please confirm which one is intended by \u201c7.2\u201d. Below I audit accordingly.\n\nProver 1 (units). Strengths: (a) Torsion units: the argument is correct in spirit; with a clean proof using the injection into Z[[q\u22121]] and the formal logarithm in Q[[q\u22121]], one gets u^m=1 \u21d2 u=\u00b11. (b) p-adic congruence u(\u03b6) \u2261 u(1) mod p for \u03b6 of p-power order (p odd) is correct. (c) The \u201crigidity by infinite exact matches\u201d is correct but the proof should use Theorem 2 (\u03c4 over an infinite set of roots Z that contains infinitely many of p-power order) rather than Theorem 3 over orders. With Z = {\u03b6 : u(\u03b6)=\u00b1\u03b6^i}, \u03c4_{N,Z} is injective, so w=\u00b1q^{\u2212i}u maps to 1 at all \u03b6\u2208Z, hence w=1. Weakness: The claim \u201cif u\u2208Z[q,q^{-1}] \u2229 U(Z\u0302[q]) then u\u2208{\u00b1q^i}\u201d is not justified by mere inclusion of rings; it requires a separate argument (e.g., via values at infinitely many \u03b6 or norms). Please remove or prove it.\n\nProver 2 (injectivity). The \u201cray-sparse reduction\u201d is a useful framing; the plan to handle prime-order sets and CRT obstructions is coherent. The \u03b3_m non-unit test via reduction modulo (\u03a6_p, p) is a good concrete next step.\n\nProver 3 (injectivity). The \u201cchain injectivity\u201d Theorem A\u2019s proof is flawed. The step W_{i+1}=W_i \u03a6_{m_{i+1}} \u2261 p_i(W_i A_i) (mod \u03a6_n) improperly discards the term W_i(\u03a6_{m_i}B_i); W_i does not annihilate \u03a6_{m_i} modulo (\u03a6_n). Thus the main inductive divisibility claim does not follow. Please retract or substantially fix.\n\nNext steps.\n- Confirm the target conjecture (units vs injectivity). If units: formalize the corrected rigidity lemma (using \u03c4 over \u03b6), keep the torsion-units proof, and prove \u03b3_m (odd m\u22653) are not units by exhibiting noninvertibility in some Z[q]/(\u03a6_p,p) with p|m. Then attack the Laurent polynomial case rigorously (e.g., show: if g\u2208Z[q,q^{-1}] and g(\u03b6)\u2208Z[\u03b6]^\u00d7 for infinitely many \u03b6, then g=\u00b1q^i).\n- If injectivity: focus on the hard \u201cray-sparse\u201d sets (e.g., prime orders). Try a CRT-based obstruction to nonzero kernels over Z, and avoid the flawed chain argument.\n",
  "summary_md": "We clarified that \u201cConjecture 7.2\u201d likely refers to either (i) injectivity of \u03c4 for any infinite set of roots of unity or (ii) the unit group U(Z\u0302[q])={\u00b1q^i}. Prover 1 provided valid partial results for the units conjecture: (1) torsion units are \u00b11 (now formalized), (2) p-adic congruence u(\u03b6)\u2261u(1) mod p on \u03bc_{p^\u221e}, and (3) a rigidity lemma is correct after fixing the proof to use \u03c4 over an infinite set of roots (Theorem 2). The claim about Laurent polynomials being the only possible units needs proof. Prover 2 offered a reasonable strategy for the injectivity conjecture (\u201cray-sparse reduction\u201d) and concrete checks (\u03b3_m non-units). Prover 3\u2019s new \u201cchain injectivity\u201d theorem has a critical error and should be withdrawn or repaired. We added rigorous proofs of (a) torsion-units triviality, (b) the corrected rigidity lemma, and (c) the p-adic congruence. Main unresolved block: producing infinitely many exact matches u(\u03b6)=\u00b1\u03b6^i, or settling Laurent-polynomial units. Verdict: uncertain.",

(Proof now in proofs.md.)\n- p-adic congruence along \u03bc_{p^\u221e}: For odd p and primitive p^a-th roots \u03b6, one has u(\u03b6) \u2261 u(1) (mod p) in Z[\u03b6]. (Proof now in proofs.md.)\n- Rigidity via infinite exact matches (corrected): If u\u2208U(Z[q]^N) and there exist i\u2208Z and infinitely many roots of unity \u03b6 of prime-power order with u(\u03b6)=\u00b1\u03b6^i, then u=\u00b1q^i. The proof must use the injectivity map \u03c4 over the set of those \u03b6 (Theorem 2), not just over their orders (Theorem 3). (Proof now in proofs.md.)\n\nCaveats\n- Claim \u201cif u\u2208Z[q,q^{-1}] is a unit in Z[q]^N then u=\u00b1q^i\u201d is not automatic from inclusion of rings; needs a separate argument (e.g., via values at infinitely many \u03b6 or norms).\n- A proposed \u2018chain injectivity\u2019 extension (divisibility chain m_{i+1}/m_i = p-power) has a gap; do not rely on it.\n\nNext steps\n- Settle \u03b3_m(q)=\u2211_{i=0}^{m-1}(-1)^i q^i (odd m\u22653): show non-unit by finding p|m such that \u03b3_m is not invertible in Z[q]/(\u03a6_p, p).\n- Laurent-polynomial case: prove that if g\u2208Z[q,q^{-1}] maps to units in Z[\u03b6] for infinitely many \u03b6, then g=\u00b1q^i (Kronecker-type strategy via norms/height).\n- Prime-power rigidity: for a fixed odd p, analyze u in Z_p[[q\u22121]] and its values on \u03bc_{p^\u221e}; attempt to force infinitely many exact equalities u(\u03b6)=\u00b1\u03b6^{i_p} to trigger the rigidity lemma; combine two primes and use \u03c4-injectivity.\n- Clarify the target conjecture (\u201c7.2\u201d) to prioritize either the unit group or the general injectivity for arbitrary infinite Z."

By Theorem 13 of Habiro, Z[q]^N injects into Z[[q\u22121]]. Embed further into Q[[q\u22121]]. Write u=\u2211_{k\u22650} a_k (q\u22121)^k with a_0\u2208{\u00b11}. If a_0=1, set v=u; if a_0=\u22121 and m is even, set v=\u2212u; then in either case v has constant term 1 and v^m=1. In Q[[q\u22121]], the formal logarithm log(1+x) is well-defined for x in (q\u22121)Q[[q\u22121]], and m\u00b7log v=log(v^m)=0 implies log v=0, hence v=1. Thus u=\u00b11. If a_0=\u22121 and m is odd, then u^m has constant term \u22121, contradicting u^m=1. \u220e\n\n2) Lemma (p-adic congruence on \u03bc_{p^\u221e}). Let p be an odd prime, u\u2208Z[q]^N, and \u03b6 a primitive p^a-th root of unity. Then u(\u03b6)\u2261u(1) (mod p) in Z[\u03b6].\nProof. In Z[[q\u22121]] write u(q)=s+\u2211_{k\u22651} c_k (q\u22121)^k with s=u(1)\u2208{\u00b11}. In Z_p[\u03b6] one has \u03b6\u22611 (mod p), so (\u03b6\u22121) has positive p-adic valuation. The series \u2211 c_k (\u03b6\u22121)^k converges p-adically and is divisible by p. Therefore u(\u03b6)\u2261s (mod p). \u220e\n\n3) Proposition (rigidity from infinitely many exact matches). Let u\u2208U(Z[q]^N). Suppose there exist i\u2208Z and an infinite set Z\u2032 of roots of unity of prime-power order such that u(\u03b6)=\u00b1\u03b6^i for all \u03b6\u2208Z\u2032. Then u=\u00b1q^i.\nProof. Set w=\u00b1q^{\u2212i}u so that w(\u03b6)=1 for all \u03b6\u2208Z\u2032. By Theorem 2 (Habiro), since Z\u2032 contains infinitely many roots of prime-power order, the evaluation map \u03c4_{N,Z\u2032}: Z[q]^N\u2192\u220f_{\u03b6\u2208Z\u2032} Z[\u03b6] is injective.
