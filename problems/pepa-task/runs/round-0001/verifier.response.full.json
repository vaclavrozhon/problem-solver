Their reasoning suggests that in a power series ring of characteristic 0, the only torsion units are those with constant term \u00b11.

          "text": "{\"feedback_md\":\"Scope and clarification. The statement \u201cConjecture 7.2\u201d is not present verbatim in the provided excerpt. The two salient conjectures in Habiro\u2019s paper are: (i) injectivity of \u03c4 for any infinite set of roots of unity (Conj. 5 in the tex), and (ii) the unit group of the Habiro ring is exactly {\u00b1q^i} (Conj. 7 in the tex). Prover 1 worked on the units conjecture; Provers 2\u20133 focused on injectivity. Please confirm which one is intended by \u201c7.2\u201d. Below I audit accordingly.\\n\\nProver 1 (units). Strengths: (a) Torsion units: the argument is correct in spirit; with a clean proof using the injection into Z[[q\u22121]] and the formal logarithm in Q[[q\u22121]], one gets u^m=1 \u21d2 u=\u00b11. (b) p-adic congruence u(\u03b6) \u2261 u(1) mod p for \u03b6 of p-power order (p odd) is correct. (c) The \u201crigidity by infinite exact matches\u201d is correct but the proof should use Theorem 2 (\u03c4 over an infinite set of roots Z that contains infinitely many of p-power order) rather than Theorem 3 over orders. With Z = {\u03b6 : u(\u03b6)=\u00b1\u03b6^i}, \u03c4_{N,Z} is injective, so w=\u00b1q^{\u2212i}u maps to 1 at all \u03b6\u2208Z, hence w=1. Weakness: The claim \u201cif u\u2208Z[q,q^{-1}] \u2229 U(Z\u0302[q]) then u\u2208{\u00b1q^i}\u201d is not justified by mere inclusion of rings; it requires a separate argument (e.g., via values at infinitely many \u03b6 or norms). Please remove or prove it.\\n\\nProver 2 (injectivity). The \u201cray-sparse reduction\u201d is a useful framing; the plan to handle prime-order sets and CRT obstructions is coherent. The \u03b3_m non-unit test via reduction modulo (\u03a6_p, p) is a good concrete next step.\\n\\nProver 3 (injectivity). The \u201cchain injectivity\u201d Theorem A\u2019s proof is flawed. The step W_{i+1}=W_i \u03a6_{m_{i+1}} \u2261 p_i(W_i A_i) (mod \u03a6_n) improperly discards the term W_i(\u03a6_{m_i}B_i); W_i does not annihilate \u03a6_{m_i} modulo (\u03a6_n). Thus the main inductive divisibility claim does not follow. Please retract or substantially fix.\\n\\nNext steps.\\n- Confirm the target conjecture (units vs injectivity). If units: formalize the corrected rigidity lemma (using \u03c4 over \u03b6), keep the torsion-units proof, and prove \u03b3_m (odd m\u22653) are not units by exhibiting noninvertibility in some Z[q]/(\u03a6_p,p) with p|m. Then attack the Laurent polynomial case rigorously (e.g., show: if g\u2208Z[q,q^{-1}] and g(\u03b6)\u2208Z[\u03b6]^\u00d7 for infinitely many \u03b6, then g=\u00b1q^i).\\n- If injectivity: focus on the hard \u201cray-sparse\u201d sets (e.g., prime orders). Try a CRT-based obstruction to nonzero kernels over Z, and avoid the flawed chain argument.\\n\",\"summary_md\":\"We clarified that \u201cConjecture 7.2\u201d likely refers to either (i) injectivity of \u03c4 for any infinite set of roots of unity or (ii) the unit group U(Z\u0302[q])={\u00b1q^i}. Prover 1 provided valid partial results for the units conjecture: (1) torsion units are \u00b11 (now formalized), (2) p-adic congruence u(\u03b6)\u2261u(1) mod p on \u03bc_{p^\u221e}, and (3) a rigidity lemma is correct after fixing the proof to use \u03c4 over an infinite set of roots (Theorem 2).

Write u=\u2211_{k\u22650} a_k (q\u22121)^k with a_0\u2208{\u00b11}. If a_0=1, set v=u; if a_0=\u22121 and m is even, set v=\u2212u; then in either case v has constant term 1 and v^m=1. In Q[[q\u22121]], the formal logarithm log(1+x) is well-defined for x in (q\u22121)Q[[q\u22121]], and m\u00b7log v=log(v^m)=0 implies log v=0, hence v=1. Thus u=\u00b11.
