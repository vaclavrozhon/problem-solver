We clarified that “Conjecture 7.2” likely refers to either (i) injectivity of τ for any infinite set of roots of unity or (ii) the unit group U(Ẑ[q])={±q^i}. Prover 1 provided valid partial results for the units conjecture: (1) torsion units are ±1 (now formalized), (2) p-adic congruence u(ζ)≡u(1) mod p on μ_{p^∞}, and (3) a rigidity lemma is correct after fixing the proof to use τ over an infinite set of roots (Theorem 2). The claim about Laurent polynomials being the only possible units needs proof. Prover 2 offered a reasonable strategy for the injectivity conjecture (“ray-sparse reduction”) and concrete checks (γ_m non-units). Prover 3’s new “chain injectivity” theorem has a critical error and should be withdrawn or repaired. We added rigorous proofs of (a) torsion-units triviality, (b) the corrected rigidity lemma, and (c) the p-adic congruence. Main unresolved block: producing infinitely many exact matches u(ζ)=±ζ^i, or settling Laurent-polynomial units. Verdict: uncertain.
