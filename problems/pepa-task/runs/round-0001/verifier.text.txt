{"feedback_md":"Scope and clarification. The statement “Conjecture 7.2” is not present verbatim in the provided excerpt. The two salient conjectures in Habiro’s paper are: (i) injectivity of τ for any infinite set of roots of unity (Conj. 5 in the tex), and (ii) the unit group of the Habiro ring is exactly {±q^i} (Conj. 7 in the tex). Prover 1 worked on the units conjecture; Provers 2–3 focused on injectivity. Please confirm which one is intended by “7.2”. Below I audit accordingly.\n\nProver 1 (units). Strengths: (a) Torsion units: the argument is correct in spirit; with a clean proof using the injection into Z[[q−1]] and the formal logarithm in Q[[q−1]], one gets u^m=1 ⇒ u=±1. (b) p-adic congruence u(ζ) ≡ u(1) mod p for ζ of p-power order (p odd) is correct. (c) The “rigidity by infinite exact matches” is correct but the proof should use Theorem 2 (τ over an infinite set of roots Z that contains infinitely many of p-power order) rather than Theorem 3 over orders. With Z = {ζ : u(ζ)=±ζ^i}, τ_{N,Z} is injective, so w=±q^{−i}u maps to 1 at all ζ∈Z, hence w=1. Weakness: The claim “if u∈Z[q,q^{-1}] ∩ U(Ẑ[q]) then u∈{±q^i}” is not justified by mere inclusion of rings; it requires a separate argument (e.g., via values at infinitely many ζ or norms). Please remove or prove it.\n\nProver 2 (injectivity). The “ray-sparse reduction” is a useful framing; the plan to handle prime-order sets and CRT obstructions is coherent. The γ_m non-unit test via reduction modulo (Φ_p, p) is a good concrete next step.\n\nProver 3 (injectivity). The “chain injectivity” Theorem A’s proof is flawed. The step W_{i+1}=W_i Φ_{m_{i+1}} ≡ p_i(W_i A_i) (mod Φ_n) improperly discards the term W_i(Φ_{m_i}B_i); W_i does not annihilate Φ_{m_i} modulo (Φ_n). Thus the main inductive divisibility claim does not follow. Please retract or substantially fix.\n\nNext steps.\n- Confirm the target conjecture (units vs injectivity). If units: formalize the corrected rigidity lemma (using τ over ζ), keep the torsion-units proof, and prove γ_m (odd m≥3) are not units by exhibiting noninvertibility in some Z[q]/(Φ_p,p) with p|m. Then attack the Laurent polynomial case rigorously (e.g., show: if g∈Z[q,q^{-1}] and g(ζ)∈Z[ζ]^× for infinitely many ζ, then g=±q^i).\n- If injectivity: focus on the hard “ray-sparse” sets (e.g., prime orders). Try a CRT-based obstruction to nonzero kernels over Z, and avoid the flawed chain argument.\n","summary_md":"We clarified that “Conjecture 7.2” likely refers to either (i) injectivity of τ for any infinite set of roots of unity or (ii) the unit group U(Ẑ[q])={±q^i}. Prover 1 provided valid partial results for the units conjecture: (1) torsion units are ±1 (now formalized), (2) p-adic congruence u(ζ)≡u(1) mod p on μ_{p^∞}, and (3) a rigidity lemma is correct after fixing the proof to use τ over an infinite set of roots (Theorem 2). The claim about Laurent polynomials being the only possible units needs proof. Prover 2 offered a reasonable strategy for the injectivity conjecture (“ray-sparse reduction”) and concrete checks (γ_m non-units). Prover 3’s new “chain injectivity” theorem has a critical error and should be withdrawn or repaired. We added rigorous proofs of (a) torsion-units triviality, (b) the corrected rigidity lemma, and (c) the p-adic congruence. Main unresolved block: producing infinitely many exact matches u(ζ)=±ζ^i, or settling Laurent-polynomial units.

If u∈Z[q]^N and u^m=1 for some m≥1, then u=±1.\nProof. By Theorem 13 of Habiro, Z[q]^N injects into Z[[q−1]]. Embed further into Q[[q−1]]. Write u=∑_{k≥0} a_k (q−1)^k with a_0∈{±1}. If a_0=1, set v=u; if a_0=−1 and m is even, set v=−u; then in either case v has constant term 1 and v^m=1. In Q[[q−1]], the formal logarithm log(1+x) is well-defined for x in (q−1)Q[[q−1]], and m·log v=log(v^m)=0 implies log v=0, hence v=1. Thus u=±1. If a_0=−1 and m is odd, then u^m has constant term −1, contradicting u^m=1. ∎\n\n2) Lemma (p-adic congruence on μ_{p^∞}). Let p be an odd prime, u∈Z[q]^N, and ζ a primitive p^a-th root of unity. Then u(ζ)≡u(1) (mod p) in Z[ζ].\nProof. In Z[[q−1]] write u(q)=s+∑_{k≥1} c_k (q−1)^k with s=u(1)∈{±1}. In Z_p[ζ] one has ζ≡1 (mod p), so (ζ−1) has positive p-adic valuation. The series ∑ c_k (ζ−1)^k converges p-adically and is divisible by p. Therefore u(ζ)≡s (mod p). ∎\n\n3) Proposition (rigidity from infinitely many exact matches). Let u∈U(Z[q]^N). Suppose there exist i∈Z and an infinite set Z′ of roots of unity of prime-power order such that u(ζ)=±ζ^i for all ζ∈Z′. Then u=±q^i.\nProof. Set w=±q^{−i}u so that w(ζ)=1 for all ζ∈Z′. By Theorem 2 (Habiro), since Z′ contains infinitely many roots of prime-power order, the evaluation map τ_{N,Z′}: Z[q]^N→∏_{ζ∈Z′} Z[ζ] is injective. Thus w=1, so u=±q^i. ∎"},"output_update":null}
