Thus a Habiro-unit evaluates to a unit at every root of unity.\\n\\n\\nResult 1. Torsion units are trivial\\n- If u^m=1 in \u2124\u0302[q], then u=\u00b11. Proof: embed \u2124\u0302[q]\u2192\u2124[[q\u22121]] (Theorem 4.2/6.3 in paper). Over \u211a[[q\u22121]], no nontrivial torsion; the only integral torsion solutions are \u00b11. (Already in notes; kept for completeness.)\\n\\n\\nResult 2. Non-unit example \u03b3_m(q)=\u2211_{i=0}^{m\u22121}(\u22121)^i q^i (odd m\u22653)\\n- Not a unit: \u03b3_m(\u22121)=m\u2209{\u00b11}, but units must map to \u00b11 at \u03b6=\u22121 (since \u2124[\u22121]=\u2124). This settles the proposed test family.\\n\\n\\nResult 3. Laurent-polynomial units are exactly \u00b1q^i\\nTheorem. If g \u2208 \u2124[q,q^{\u22121}] is invertible in \u2124\u0302[q], then g = \u00b1 q^i.\\n- Step 1. As above, g(\u03b6) \u2208 \u2124[\u03b6]^\u00d7 for every root of unity \u03b6.\\n- Step 2. Choose M so that h(x)=x^M g(x)\u2208\u2124[x]. Then h(\u03b6) is a unit for every \u03b6, and for all sufficiently large primes \u2113 one has gcd(h,\u03a6_\u2113)=1 and\\n  N_{\u211a(\u03b6_\u2113)/\u211a}(h(\u03b6_\u2113)) = Res(\u03a6_\u2113,h) \u2208 {\u00b11}.\\n- Step 3 (Mahler measure). For prime \u2113, the primitive \u2113th roots are {e^{2\u03c0 i j/\u2113} | 1\u2264j\u2264\u2113\u22121}; hence\\n  (1/(\u2113\u22121)) log|Res(\u03a6_\u2113,h)| = (1/(\u2113\u22121)) \u2211_{j=1}^{\u2113\u22121} log|h(e^{2\u03c0 i j/\u2113})| \u2192 m(h),\\n  the (logarithmic) Mahler measure of h, by equidistribution/Riemann sums and integrability of log|h| on the unit circle away from finitely many bad \u2113 (those dividing any cyclotomic factor of h).\\n  Since |Res(\u03a6_\u2113,h)|=1 infinitely often, we get m(h)=0.\\n- Step 4 (Kronecker). If m(h)=0 with h\u2208\u2124[x], then h(x)=\u00b1 x^k \u220f_s \u03a6_{d_s}(x)^{e_s} (product of cyclotomic polynomials times a monomial).\\n- Step 5 (eliminate cyclotomic factors). If any \u03a6_d|h, then h(\u03b6_d)=0 contradicts that h(\u03b6_d) is a unit. Hence h(x)=\u00b1 x^k, so g(x)=\u00b1 x^{k\u2212M}.\\nThis proves the theorem.\\n\\nWhy useful: This settles Conjecture 7.2 for the important subclass \u2124[q,q^{\u22121}]\u2229U(\u2124\u0302[q]) and removes a lingering caveat flagged in prior feedback.\\n\\n\\nResult 4. Rigidity by infinite exact matches (clean version)\\nLemma. If u\u2208U(\u2124\u0302[q]) and there exist i\u2208\u2124 and an infinite set Z of roots of unity containing infinitely many of prime-power order such that u(\u03b6)=\u00b1\u03b6^i for all \u03b6\u2208Z, then u=\u00b1q^i.\\n- Proof. The map \u03c4_{\u2115,Z}:\u2124\u0302[q]\u2192\u220f_{\u03b6\u2208Z}\u2124[\u03b6] is injective (Theorem 6.4/Thm 2). The element w=\u00b1q^{\u2212i}u maps to 1 on Z, hence w=1.\\n\\n\\nResult 5. p-adic congruence along \u00b5_{p^\u221e} (odd p)\\nLemma. For u\u2208U(\u2124\u0302[q]) and any primitive p^a-th root \u03b6 (p odd), one has u(\u03b6) \u2261 u(1) (mod p) in \u2124[\u03b6].\\n- Proof. In \u2124_p[\u03b6], \u03b6\u22611 (mod p). Expanding u in \u2124_p[[q\u22121]] gives the congruence.\\n\\n\\nIdeas toward the full conjecture\\n- Normalization: For any u\u2208U(\u2124\u0302[q]) there exist \u03b5=\u00b11 and i\u2208{0,1} such that v=\u03b5 q^{\u2212i}u satisfies v(1)=v(\u22121)=1. It suffices to show v=1.\\n- Prime-power rigidity: For fixed odd p, analyze v on \u00b5_{p^\u221e} via its \u2124_p[[q\u22121]] expansion. Aim: produce infinitely many exact equalities v(\u03b6)=1 (not only mod p), then apply Result 4.\\n- Truncation structure: For primitive \u2113th roots, u(\u03b6) equals a finite sum \u2211_{n<\u2113} a_n(\u03b6) (\u03b6)_n. The norm condition N(u(\u03b6))=\u00b11 imposes strong resultant constraints on the polynomials P_\u2113(x)=\u2211_{n<\u2113} a_n(x)(x)_n. A plausible strategy is to show that for infinitely many primes \u2113, P_\u2113 must be a monomial \u00b1x^i, forcing u(\u03b6)=\u00b1\u03b6^i and hence u=\u00b1q^i by Result 4.\\n\\n\\nObstacles\\n- Upgrading congruences u(\u03b6)\u22611 (mod p) on \u00b5_{p^\u221e} to infinitely many exact equalities appears to require deep p-adic analytic inputs (e.g., Coleman theory), as u is not a multiplicative character.\\n- Controlling the shape of P_\u2113 across infinitely many primes is nontrivial; while Mahler-measure arguments work for a fixed polynomial, here P_\u2113 varies with \u2113.\\n\\n\\nNext steps (auditable)\\n1) Formalize Result 3 (Laurent-polynomial units) in proofs.md with full details of the equidistribution/Mahler-measure limit and Kronecker\u2019s theorem, and record that this removes the earlier caveat.\\n2) Strengthen p-adic analysis: For fixed odd p, bound v_p(u(\u03b6)\u2212u(1)) uniformly in terms of the truncation level to seek exact equalities at infinitely many levels.\\n3) Resultant approach for truncations: For infinitely many primes \u2113, study Res(\u03a6_\u2113, P_\u2113). Since each equals \u00b11, try to deduce rigid constraints on the initial coefficients a_n.\\n4) Attempt a hybrid: combine two distinct primes p\u2260q to force exact matches on sets Z_p,Z_q and conclude via Result 4.\\n\\n\"}",
