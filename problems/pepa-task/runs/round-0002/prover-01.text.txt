# Clarification of Conjecture 7.2
We work on: U(ℤ̂[q]) = {± q^i | i ∈ ℤ} for the Habiro ring ℤ̂[q]=ℤ[q]^{ℕ}.


Key tool: evaluation at roots of unity
- If u ∈ ℤ̂[q] is a unit, then for every root of unity ζ, its image σ_ζ(u) ∈ ℤ[ζ][[q−ζ]] is a unit; hence its constant term u(ζ) ∈ ℤ[ζ] is a unit. Thus a Habiro-unit evaluates to a unit at every root of unity.


Result 1. Torsion units are trivial
- If u^m=1 in ℤ̂[q], then u=±1. Proof: embed ℤ̂[q]→ℤ[[q−1]] (Theorem 4.2/6.3 in paper). Over ℚ[[q−1]], no nontrivial torsion; the only integral torsion solutions are ±1. (Already in notes; kept for completeness.)


Result 2. Non-unit example γ_m(q)=∑_{i=0}^{m−1}(−1)^i q^i (odd m≥3)
- Not a unit: γ_m(−1)=m∉{±1}, but units must map to ±1 at ζ=−1 (since ℤ[−1]=ℤ). This settles the proposed test family.


Result 3. Laurent-polynomial units are exactly ±q^i
Theorem. If g ∈ ℤ[q,q^{−1}] is invertible in ℤ̂[q], then g = ± q^i.
- Step 1. As above, g(ζ) ∈ ℤ[ζ]^× for every root of unity ζ.
- Step 2. Choose M so that h(x)=x^M g(x)∈ℤ[x]. Then h(ζ) is a unit for every ζ, and for all sufficiently large primes ℓ one has gcd(h,Φ_ℓ)=1 and
  N_{ℚ(ζ_ℓ)/ℚ}(h(ζ_ℓ)) = Res(Φ_ℓ,h) ∈ {±1}.
- Step 3 (Mahler measure). For prime ℓ, the primitive ℓth roots are {e^{2π i j/ℓ} | 1≤j≤ℓ−1}; hence
  (1/(ℓ−1)) log|Res(Φ_ℓ,h)| = (1/(ℓ−1)) ∑_{j=1}^{ℓ−1} log|h(e^{2π i j/ℓ})| → m(h),
  the (logarithmic) Mahler measure of h, by equidistribution/Riemann sums and integrability of log|h| on the unit circle away from finitely many bad ℓ (those dividing any cyclotomic factor of h).
  Since |Res(Φ_ℓ,h)|=1 infinitely often, we get m(h)=0.
- Step 4 (Kronecker). If m(h)=0 with h∈ℤ[x], then h(x)=± x^k ∏_s Φ_{d_s}(x)^{e_s} (product of cyclotomic polynomials times a monomial).
- Step 5 (eliminate cyclotomic factors). If any Φ_d|h, then h(ζ_d)=0 contradicts that h(ζ_d) is a unit. Hence h(x)=± x^k, so g(x)=± x^{k−M}.
This proves the theorem.

Why useful: This settles Conjecture 7.2 for the important subclass ℤ[q,q^{−1}]∩U(ℤ̂[q]) and removes a lingering caveat flagged in prior feedback.


Result 4. Rigidity by infinite exact matches (clean version)
Lemma. If u∈U(ℤ̂[q]) and there exist i∈ℤ and an infinite set Z of roots of unity containing infinitely many of prime-power order such that u(ζ)=±ζ^i for all ζ∈Z, then u=±q^i.
- Proof. The map τ_{ℕ,Z}:ℤ̂[q]→∏_{ζ∈Z}ℤ[ζ] is injective (Theorem 6.4/Thm 2). The element w=±q^{−i}u maps to 1 on Z, hence w=1.


Result 5. p-adic congruence along µ_{p^∞} (odd p)
Lemma. For u∈U(ℤ̂[q]) and any primitive p^a-th root ζ (p odd), one has u(ζ) ≡ u(1) (mod p) in ℤ[ζ].
- Proof. In ℤ_p[ζ], ζ≡1 (mod p). Expanding u in ℤ_p[[q−1]] gives the congruence.


Ideas toward the full conjecture
- Normalization: For any u∈U(ℤ̂[q]) there exist ε=±1 and i∈{0,1} such that v=ε q^{−i}u satisfies v(1)=v(−1)=1. It suffices to show v=1.
- Prime-power rigidity: For fixed odd p, analyze v on µ_{p^∞} via its ℤ_p[[q−1]] expansion. Aim: produce infinitely many exact equalities v(ζ)=1 (not only mod p), then apply Result 4.
- Truncation structure: For primitive ℓth roots, u(ζ) equals a finite sum ∑_{n<ℓ} a_n(ζ) (ζ)_n. The norm condition N(u(ζ))=±1 imposes strong resultant constraints on the polynomials P_ℓ(x)=∑_{n<ℓ} a_n(x)(x)_n. A plausible strategy is to show that for infinitely many primes ℓ, P_ℓ must be a monomial ±x^i, forcing u(ζ)=±ζ^i and hence u=±q^i by Result 4.


Obstacles
- Upgrading congruences u(ζ)≡1 (mod p) on µ_{p^∞} to infinitely many exact equalities appears to require deep p-adic analytic inputs (e.g., Coleman theory), as u is not a multiplicative character.
- Controlling the shape of P_ℓ across infinitely many primes is nontrivial; while Mahler-measure arguments work for a fixed polynomial, here P_ℓ varies with ℓ.


Next steps (auditable)
1) Formalize Result 3 (Laurent-polynomial units) in proofs.md with full details of the equidistribution/Mahler-measure limit and Kronecker’s theorem, and record that this removes the earlier caveat.
2) Strengthen p-adic analysis: For fixed odd p, bound v_p(u(ζ)−u(1)) uniformly in terms of the truncation level to seek exact equalities at infinitely many levels.
3) Resultant approach for truncations: For infinitely many primes ℓ, study Res(Φ_ℓ, P_ℓ). Since each equals ±1, try to deduce rigid constraints on the initial coefficients a_n.
4) Attempt a hybrid: combine two distinct primes p≠q to force exact matches on sets Z_p,Z_q and conclude via Result 4.
