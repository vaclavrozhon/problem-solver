I record several necessary conditions and special cases, plus a concrete family of non-units, to narrow the search space and provide testable checkpoints.\\n\\nBasic necessary conditions for units\\n\\n- Lemma 1 (Units map to units at roots of unity; why: evaluation detects non-units). For any root of unity \u03b6, the evaluation map ev_\u03b6: Z[q]^N \u2192 Z[\u03b6] is a ring homomorphism, so if u \u2208 U(Z[q]^N) then u(\u03b6) \u2208 U(Z[\u03b6]). In particular, taking \u03b6 = 1 and \u03b6 = \u22121 gives u(1) \u2208 {\u00b11} and u(\u22121) \u2208 {\u00b11}.\\n  Proof. The evaluation map is the component of \u03c4^Z_{N,{\u03b6}}; ring homomorphisms send units to units.\\n\\n- Lemma 2 (Torsion units are trivial; why: rules out nontrivial finite-order counterexamples). If u \u2208 Z[q]^N satisfies u^m = 1 for some m \u2265 1, then u = \u00b11.\\n  Proof. Inject via \u03c3^Z_{N,1}: Z[q]^N \u21aa Z[[x]] with x = q\u22121. Write v = \u03c3(u) \u2208 Z[[x]]. In Z[[x]], v is a unit. Its constant term c \u2208 {\u00b11} and v = c\u00b7(1 + a) with a \u2208 x Z[[x]]. If c = 1, pass to Q[[x]] and take the formal logarithm: 0 = log(v^m) = m log(v) \u21d2 log(v) = 0 \u21d2 v = 1. If c = \u22121, then (\u22121)^m (1+a)^m = 1. If m odd this is impossible (constant term \u22121). If m even, (1+a)^m = 1, hence v = \u22121. Pulling back gives u = \u00b11.\\n\\n- Lemma 3 (Odd prime-power congruence; why: p-adic rigidity along \u03bc_{p^\u221e}). Let p be odd and \u03b6 a primitive p^a-th root of unity. Then for any u \u2208 Z[q]^N, u(\u03b6) \u2261 u(1) mod p in Z[\u03b6].\\n  Proof. In Z_p[\u03b6], \u03b6 \u2261 1 mod p (the maximal ideal above p is generated by 1\u2212\u03b6), hence for f \u2208 Z[q], f(\u03b6) \u2261 f(1) mod p. Continuity extends this to u \u2208 Z[q]^N via the inverse limit defining evaluation.\\n\\nRigidity from infinitely many exact matches\\n\\n- Proposition 4 (Exact-match rigidity; why: a criterion to force u = \u00b1q^i). If u \u2208 U(Z[q]^N) and there exist i \u2208 Z and an infinite set Z of roots of unity containing infinitely many of prime-power order such that u(\u03b6) = \u00b1 \u03b6^i for all \u03b6 \u2208 Z, then u = \u00b1 q^i.\\n  Proof. Consider w = (\u00b1)q^{\u2212i}u \u2208 Z[q]^N. Then w(\u03b6) = 1 for all \u03b6 \u2208 Z. By Theorem 2 (\u03c4^Z_{N,Z} injective when Z contains infinitely many prime powers), w = 1.\\n\\nA concrete family of non-units\\n\\n- Proposition 5 (Alternating sums \u03b3_m are not units; why: rules out a natural infinite family). For odd m \u2265 3, \u03b3_m(q) = \u2211_{i=0}^{m\u22121} (\u22121)^i q^i \u2209 U(Z[q]^N).\\n  Proof. Let p be any odd prime dividing m and \u03b6 a primitive p-th root. Since m is odd, \u03b3_m(q) = (1 + q^m)/(1 + q), hence \u03b3_m(\u03b6) = 2/(1+\u03b6). In Q(\u03b6), \u220f_{a\u2208(Z/pZ)^\u00d7} (1+\u03b6^a) = \u03a6_p(\u22121) = 1, so 1+\u03b6 is a unit in Z[\u03b6]. Thus \u03b3_m(\u03b6) = 2\u00b7(1+\u03b6)^{\u22121} is non-unit (a unit times 2, and 2 is not a unit in Z[\u03b6]). By Lemma 1, \u03b3_m cannot be a unit in Z[q]^N.\\n\\nLaurent-polynomial necessary tests\\n\\n- Lemma 6 (Value tests at 1 and \u22121; why: quick filters for Laurent candidates). If g \u2208 Z[q,q^{\u22121}] lies in U(Z[q]^N), then g(1) = \u00b11 and g(\u22121) = \u00b11.\\n  Proof. Apply Lemma 1 with \u03b6 = 1 and \u03b6 = \u22121.\\n\\n- Corollary 7 (Many two-term Laurent polynomials fail; why: quick eliminations). If g(q) = a q^r + b q^s with a,b \u2208 Z and |a|+|b| \u2265 2, then g \u2209 U(Z[q]^N) unless g = \u00b1 q^k. Indeed g(1) = a + b \u2208 Z\\\\{\u00b11} unless g is monomial \u00b1q^k, so Lemma 6 rules it out.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\n- \u03b3_3(q) = 1 \u2212 q + q^2: at \u03b6_3, \u03b3_3(\u03b6_3) = 2/(1+\u03b6_3) is non-unit, so \u03b3_3 \u2209 U(Z[q]^N).\\n- g(q) = 2 \u2212 q: g(1) = 1 but g(\u22121) = 3 \u2260 \u00b11, hence g \u2209 U(Z[q]^N).\\n\\nObstacles\\n\\n- Extending Proposition 4 to a general mechanism that produces infinitely many exact equalities u(\u03b6) = \u00b1\u03b6^i from p-adic congruences (Lemma 3) remains open.\\n- A full Laurent-polynomial characterization \u201cg \u2208 Z[q,q^{\u22121}] \u2229 U(Z[q]^N) \u21d2 g = \u00b1q^k\u201d likely needs a resultant/height argument: for non-monomial g, the integers Res(g, \u03a6_p) = \u00b1\u220f_{a} g(\u03b6_p^a) should fail to be \u00b11 for infinitely many p, contradicting unit-values. Making this uniform and elementary is pending.\\n\\nNext steps (concrete, checkable)\\n\\n1) Formalize the resultant route for two-term and three-term Laurent polynomials: show that for infinitely many odd primes p, at least one value g(\u03b6_p^a) is a non-unit, hence g \u2209 U.\\n2) Strengthen Lemma 3: for fixed odd p, analyze u on \u03bc_{p^\u221e} via \u03c3^Z_{N,\u03b6} into Z_p[\u03b6][[q\u2212\u03b6]]; seek conditions implying u(\u03b6) actually equals \u00b1\u03b6^{i_p} for infinitely many a, then apply Proposition 4.\\n3) Necessary condition at all prime powers: record that for u \u2208 U(Z[q]^N), u(\u03b6_{p^a}) \u2261 \u00b11 mod p for all odd p, all a \u2265 1; verify whether this forces u to be a cyclotomic unit times a power of \u03b6; attempt to rule out the cyclotomic unit factor via evaluation at p | g(1).\\n4) Catalogue and test more families (e.g., 1 \u00b1 q^k, 1 \u00b1 q^k \u00b1 q^\u2113) against Lemma 6 and evaluation at small orders (\u03b6_3, \u03b6_4, \u03b6_5) to expand the bank of excluded patterns.\\n\\nSummary of progress\\n- Proved: torsion units are \u00b11; necessary conditions u(\u00b11)=\u00b11; p-adic congruence along \u03bc_{p^\u221e}; rigidity from infinitely many exact matches; and non-unit status of \u03b3_m for all odd m \u2265 3. These tighten constraints and eliminate natural counterexample families.\\n\"}",
