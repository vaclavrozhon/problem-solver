Work toward Conjecture 7.2 (units in the Habiro ring)

Assumed target. Conjecture 7.2: U(Z[q]^N) = {± q^i | i ∈ Z}. I record several necessary conditions and special cases, plus a concrete family of non-units, to narrow the search space and provide testable checkpoints.

Basic necessary conditions for units

- Lemma 1 (Units map to units at roots of unity; why: evaluation detects non-units). For any root of unity ζ, the evaluation map ev_ζ: Z[q]^N → Z[ζ] is a ring homomorphism, so if u ∈ U(Z[q]^N) then u(ζ) ∈ U(Z[ζ]). In particular, taking ζ = 1 and ζ = −1 gives u(1) ∈ {±1} and u(−1) ∈ {±1}.
  Proof. The evaluation map is the component of τ^Z_{N,{ζ}}; ring homomorphisms send units to units.

- Lemma 2 (Torsion units are trivial; why: rules out nontrivial finite-order counterexamples). If u ∈ Z[q]^N satisfies u^m = 1 for some m ≥ 1, then u = ±1.
  Proof. Inject via σ^Z_{N,1}: Z[q]^N ↪ Z[[x]] with x = q−1. Write v = σ(u) ∈ Z[[x]]. In Z[[x]], v is a unit. Its constant term c ∈ {±1} and v = c·(1 + a) with a ∈ x Z[[x]]. If c = 1, pass to Q[[x]] and take the formal logarithm: 0 = log(v^m) = m log(v) ⇒ log(v) = 0 ⇒ v = 1. If c = −1, then (−1)^m (1+a)^m = 1. If m odd this is impossible (constant term −1). If m even, (1+a)^m = 1, hence v = −1. Pulling back gives u = ±1.

- Lemma 3 (Odd prime-power congruence; why: p-adic rigidity along μ_{p^∞}). Let p be odd and ζ a primitive p^a-th root of unity. Then for any u ∈ Z[q]^N, u(ζ) ≡ u(1) mod p in Z[ζ].
  Proof. In Z_p[ζ], ζ ≡ 1 mod p (the maximal ideal above p is generated by 1−ζ), hence for f ∈ Z[q], f(ζ) ≡ f(1) mod p. Continuity extends this to u ∈ Z[q]^N via the inverse limit defining evaluation.

Rigidity from infinitely many exact matches

- Proposition 4 (Exact-match rigidity; why: a criterion to force u = ±q^i). If u ∈ U(Z[q]^N) and there exist i ∈ Z and an infinite set Z of roots of unity containing infinitely many of prime-power order such that u(ζ) = ± ζ^i for all ζ ∈ Z, then u = ± q^i.
  Proof. Consider w = (±)q^{−i}u ∈ Z[q]^N. Then w(ζ) = 1 for all ζ ∈ Z. By Theorem 2 (τ^Z_{N,Z} injective when Z contains infinitely many prime powers), w = 1.

A concrete family of non-units

- Proposition 5 (Alternating sums γ_m are not units; why: rules out a natural infinite family). For odd m ≥ 3, γ_m(q) = ∑_{i=0}^{m−1} (−1)^i q^i ∉ U(Z[q]^N).
  Proof. Let p be any odd prime dividing m and ζ a primitive p-th root. Since m is odd, γ_m(q) = (1 + q^m)/(1 + q), hence γ_m(ζ) = 2/(1+ζ). In Q(ζ), ∏_{a∈(Z/pZ)^×} (1+ζ^a) = Φ_p(−1) = 1, so 1+ζ is a unit in Z[ζ]. Thus γ_m(ζ) = 2·(1+ζ)^{−1} is non-unit (a unit times 2, and 2 is not a unit in Z[ζ]). By Lemma 1, γ_m cannot be a unit in Z[q]^N.

Laurent-polynomial necessary tests

- Lemma 6 (Value tests at 1 and −1; why: quick filters for Laurent candidates). If g ∈ Z[q,q^{−1}] lies in U(Z[q]^N), then g(1) = ±1 and g(−1) = ±1.
  Proof. Apply Lemma 1 with ζ = 1 and ζ = −1.

- Corollary 7 (Many two-term Laurent polynomials fail; why: quick eliminations). If g(q) = a q^r + b q^s with a,b ∈ Z and |a|+|b| ≥ 2, then g ∉ U(Z[q]^N) unless g = ± q^k. Indeed g(1) = a + b ∈ Z\{±1} unless g is monomial ±q^k, so Lemma 6 rules it out.

Examples

- γ_3(q) = 1 − q + q^2: at ζ_3, γ_3(ζ_3) = 2/(1+ζ_3) is non-unit, so γ_3 ∉ U(Z[q]^N).
- g(q) = 2 − q: g(1) = 1 but g(−1) = 3 ≠ ±1, hence g ∉ U(Z[q]^N).

Obstacles

- Extending Proposition 4 to a general mechanism that produces infinitely many exact equalities u(ζ) = ±ζ^i from p-adic congruences (Lemma 3) remains open.
- A full Laurent-polynomial characterization “g ∈ Z[q,q^{−1}] ∩ U(Z[q]^N) ⇒ g = ±q^k” likely needs a resultant/height argument: for non-monomial g, the integers Res(g, Φ_p) = ±∏_{a} g(ζ_p^a) should fail to be ±1 for infinitely many p, contradicting unit-values. Making this uniform and elementary is pending.

Next steps (concrete, checkable)

1) Formalize the resultant route for two-term and three-term Laurent polynomials: show that for infinitely many odd primes p, at least one value g(ζ_p^a) is a non-unit, hence g ∉ U.
2) Strengthen Lemma 3: for fixed odd p, analyze u on μ_{p^∞} via σ^Z_{N,ζ} into Z_p[ζ][[q−ζ]]; seek conditions implying u(ζ) actually equals ±ζ^{i_p} for infinitely many a, then apply Proposition 4.
3) Necessary condition at all prime powers: record that for u ∈ U(Z[q]^N), u(ζ_{p^a}) ≡ ±1 mod p for all odd p, all a ≥ 1; verify whether this forces u to be a cyclotomic unit times a power of ζ; attempt to rule out the cyclotomic unit factor via evaluation at p | g(1).
4) Catalogue and test more families (e.g., 1 ± q^k, 1 ± q^k ± q^ℓ) against Lemma 6 and evaluation at small orders (ζ_3, ζ_4, ζ_5) to expand the bank of excluded patterns.

Summary of progress
- Proved: torsion units are ±1; necessary conditions u(±1)=±1; p-adic congruence along μ_{p^∞}; rigidity from infinitely many exact matches; and non-unit status of γ_m for all odd m ≥ 3. These tighten constraints and eliminate natural counterexample families.
