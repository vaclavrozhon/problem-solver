If instead you intended the \u201cvalues at roots of unity\u201d injectivity conjecture (paper\u2019s Conjecture~(thm:5)), please confirm. All results below target the units conjecture.\\n\\nSummary of new results\\n- Laurent-polynomial units: If g \u2208 \u2124[q, q^{-1}] is a unit in the Habiro ring \u2124[q]^\u2115, then g = \u00b1 q^i. (New Proposition P1; gives \u03b3_m non-unit instantly.)\\n- Torsion units are trivial: If u^m = 1 in \u2124[q]^\u2115 for some m \u2265 1, then u = \u00b11. (Proposition P2.)\\n- p-adic congruence along \u03bc_{p^\u221e}: For odd p and primitive \u03b6 of order p^a, u(\u03b6) \u2261 u(1) mod p in \u2124[\u03b6]. (Proposition P3.)\\n- Rigidity from infinitely many exact matches: If a unit u satisfies u(\u03b6) = \u00b1 \u03b6^i for infinitely many \u03b6 of prime-power order, then u = \u00b1 q^i. (Proposition P4, via Theorem~(thm:2) in the paper.)\\n\\nWhy useful\\n- P1 eliminates all non-monomial Laurent polynomials as potential counterexamples. It also disposes of the classical alternating units \u03b3_m in the full Habiro ring.\\n- P2\u2013P4 are constraints toward proving the conjecture by forcing many evaluations to be monomials and then invoking injectivity of \u03c4 over appropriate infinite sets.\\n\\nDetails and proofs\\nLemma L0 (Units in inverse limits). Let (R_I)_I be an inverse system of rings with surjective transition maps and R = lim\u2190 R_I. Then x \u2208 R is a unit iff all images x_I \u2208 R_I are units.\\nProof. If x y = 1 in R then x_I y_I = 1 in each R_I, so each x_I is a unit. Conversely, if each x_I is a unit, the inverses y_I = x_I^{-1} are compatible (since \u03c6_{I\u2192J}(x_I^{-1}) = \u03c6_{I\u2192J}(x_I)^{-1} = x_J^{-1}). Thus y = (y_I)_I \u2208 R and x y = 1.\\n\\nProposition P1 (Laurent-polynomial units are monomials). If g \u2208 \u2124[q, q^{-1}] is a unit in \u2124[q]^\u2115, then g = \u00b1 q^i.\\nProof. Write g = q^i h with i \u2208 \u2124 and h \u2208 \u2124[q], and choose i minimal so that h(0) \u2260 0. The injective map \u2124[q]^\u2115 \u2192 \u2124[[q\u22121]] (Theorem~(thm:13) with \u03b6 = 1) implies g is a unit in \u2124[[q\u22121]], hence the constant term of q^{-i} g in \u2124[[q\u22121]] is \u00b11, i.e., h(1) = \u00b11. If h is not the constant \u00b11, pick a prime p not dividing h(0) (possible since h(0) \u2260 0). Over \ud835\udd3d_p, the reduction \u0125 \u2208 \ud835\udd3d_p[q] is nonconstant with nonzero constant term, hence has some root \u03b1 \u2260 0 in an extension \ud835\udd3d_{p^f}. Let n = ord(\u03b1) in \ud835\udd3d_{p^f}^\u00d7. Then \u03b1 is a primitive n-th root of unity in characteristic p, so \u03b1 is a root of \u03a6_n modulo p. Thus the ring map \u03b8: \u2124[q]/(\u03a6_n) \u2192 \ud835\udd3d_{p^f} sending q \u21a6 \u03b1 (factoring through \u2124/p) is well-defined. We have \u03b8(h) = 0, hence \u03b8(g) = \u03b8(q^i)\u03b8(h) = 0. If g were a unit in \u2124[q]/(\u03a6_n), then \u03b8(g) would be a unit in \ud835\udd3d_{p^f}, contradiction. By L0, g cannot be a unit in the inverse limit \u2124[q]^\u2115. Therefore h = \u00b11 and g = \u00b1 q^i.\\n\\nCorollary C1 (Alternating units are not Habiro-units). For odd m \u2265 3, \u03b3_m(q) = \u2211_{j=0}^{m\u22121} (\u22121)^j q^j is not a unit in \u2124[q]^\u2115.\\nProof. \u03b3_m \u2208 \u2124[q] is not a monomial; apply P1.\\n\\nProposition P2 (Torsion units are \u00b11). If u \u2208 \u2124[q]^\u2115 satisfies u^m = 1 for some m \u2265 1, then u = \u00b11.\\nProof. Embed \u2124[q]^\u2115 \u2192 \u2124[[q\u22121]] (Theorem~(thm:13) with \u03b6=1). In \u2124[[q\u22121]], write u = c + higher terms with c \u2208 {\u00b11} (units must have unit constant term). If c = 1 and u^m = 1, then passing to \ud835\udd14[[q\u22121]] we apply the formal logarithm: log u is well-defined (since u \u2261 1 mod (q\u22121)) and m log u = log(u^m) = 0, hence log u = 0 and u = 1. If c = \u22121 and u^m = 1, then m must be even; then (\u2212u) has constant term 1 and (\u2212u)^m = 1, so (\u2212u) = 1 by the previous case, hence u = \u22121.\\n\\nProposition P3 (p-adic congruence along \u03bc_{p^\u221e}). Let p be odd. For any unit u \u2208 \u2124[q]^\u2115 and any primitive \u03b6 of order p^a, u(\u03b6) \u2261 u(1) mod p in \u2124[\u03b6].\\nProof. In \u2124[\u03b6], the unique prime above p is generated by (1 \u2212 \u03b6) and \u03b6 \u2261 1 mod p. For any f \u2208 \u2124[q], f(\u03b6) \u2261 f(1) mod p. The evaluation map ev_\u03b6: \u2124[q]^\u2115 \u2192 \u2124[\u03b6] is a ring homomorphism (paper\u2019s Section 5). Reduce u modulo p: every \u201cHabiro basis\u201d term (q)_n(\u03b6) = \u220f_{k=1}^n(1\u2212\u03b6^k) is divisible by 1\u2212\u03b6, hence by p, for n \u2265 1; thus u(\u03b6) \u2261 a_0(\u03b6) mod p, where a_0 is the image of u in \u2124[q]/(1\u2212q), i.e., a_0(\u03b6) \u2261 u(1) mod p. Therefore u(\u03b6) \u2261 u(1) mod p.\\n\\nProposition P4 (Rigidity from infinitely many exact matches). Let u \u2208 U(\u2124[q]^\u2115). If there exists i \u2208 \u2124 and an infinite set Z of roots of unity of prime-power order such that u(\u03b6) = \u00b1 \u03b6^i for all \u03b6 \u2208 Z, then u = \u00b1 q^i.\\nProof. Consider w(q) = u(q)/(\u00b1 q^i). Then w(\u03b6) = 1 for all \u03b6 \u2208 Z. The paper\u2019s Theorem~(thm:2) says the evaluation map \u03c4^\u2124_{\u2115,Z}: \u2124[q]^\u2115 \u2192 \u220f_{\u03b6\u2208Z} \u2124[\u03b6] is injective when Z contains infinitely many prime-power orders. Hence w = 1.\\n\\nExamples\\n- \u03b3_m are units modulo (q^n\u22121) for (n, 2m)=1 (as in the paper\u2019s Remark), but P1 shows they are not units in \u2124[q]^\u2115.\\n- For u(q) = \u00b1 q^i(1 + (q\u22121)), u is a unit in \u2124[[q\u22121]] but not in \u2124[q]^\u2115 by P1 (since u is Laurent polynomial and non-monomial).\\n\\nObstacles\\n- Turning the congruence u(\u03b6_{p^a}) \u2261 u(1) mod p (P3) into exact equalities u(\u03b6_{p^a}) = u(1) for infinitely many a (or u(\u03b6_{p^a}) = \u00b1 \u03b6_{p^a}^i for a fixed i) remains the key difficulty. One expects growing (1\u2212\u03b6_{p^a})-adic valuations as a \u2192 \u221e to force stabilization, but a clean argument is still missing.\\n- The previously proposed \u201cchain injectivity\u201d (using divisibility chains of orders) contained a gap (discarding a nonvanishing term mod \u03a6_n); we do not use it.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Prime-power towers: For fixed odd p, analyze u in \u2124_p[\u03b6_{p^a}][[q\u2212\u03b6_{p^a}]] via \u03c3_{\u2115,\u03b6} (Theorem~(thm:13)). Aim: show v_{(1\u2212\u03b6_{p^a})}(u(\u03b6_{p^a})/u(1) \u2212 1) \u2192 \u221e as a \u2192 \u221e, then apply p-adic unit structure in \u2124_p(\u03b6_{p^a}) to force u(\u03b6_{p^a}) = u(1) for infinitely many a.\\n- Two-prime synthesis: If the previous step yields u(\u03b6_{p^a}) = u(1) for infinitely many a and likewise for another odd prime q, injectivity of \u03c4 over Z = {\u03b6_{p^a}} \u222a {\u03b6_{q^b}} (Theorem~(thm:2)) would imply u(q) = u(1). Normalizing u(1)=\u00b11, combine with values at \u22121 to force u = \u00b1 q^i.\\n- Refine P3 to higher congruences: attempt to prove u(\u03b6_{p^a}) \u2261 u(1) mod p^t for t depending on a and the Habiro expansion depth, to enable Hensel-type lifts.\\n- Explore \u201cvalue rigidity\u201d patterns: If u(\u03b6_p) \u2208 \u03bc_{p\u22121} for infinitely many primes p, show there is a fixed i with u(\u03b6_p) = \u00b1 \u03b6_p^i for infinitely many p, then apply P4.\\n\\nConcluding remark\\nConjecture 7.2 remains open here, but P1\u2013P4 remove several potential classes of counterexamples and clarify the path: obtain infinitely many exact monomial evaluations and invoke \u03c4-injectivity.
