Clarification
I take Conjecture 7.2 to be the units conjecture (paper’s Conjecture~(thm:7)): U(ℤ[q]^ℕ) = {± q^i | i ∈ ℤ}. If instead you intended the “values at roots of unity” injectivity conjecture (paper’s Conjecture~(thm:5)), please confirm. All results below target the units conjecture.

Summary of new results
- Laurent-polynomial units: If g ∈ ℤ[q, q^{-1}] is a unit in the Habiro ring ℤ[q]^ℕ, then g = ± q^i. (New Proposition P1; gives γ_m non-unit instantly.)
- Torsion units are trivial: If u^m = 1 in ℤ[q]^ℕ for some m ≥ 1, then u = ±1. (Proposition P2.)
- p-adic congruence along μ_{p^∞}: For odd p and primitive ζ of order p^a, u(ζ) ≡ u(1) mod p in ℤ[ζ]. (Proposition P3.)
- Rigidity from infinitely many exact matches: If a unit u satisfies u(ζ) = ± ζ^i for infinitely many ζ of prime-power order, then u = ± q^i. (Proposition P4, via Theorem~(thm:2) in the paper.)

Why useful
- P1 eliminates all non-monomial Laurent polynomials as potential counterexamples. It also disposes of the classical alternating units γ_m in the full Habiro ring.
- P2–P4 are constraints toward proving the conjecture by forcing many evaluations to be monomials and then invoking injectivity of τ over appropriate infinite sets.

Details and proofs
Lemma L0 (Units in inverse limits). Let (R_I)_I be an inverse system of rings with surjective transition maps and R = lim← R_I. Then x ∈ R is a unit iff all images x_I ∈ R_I are units.
Proof. If x y = 1 in R then x_I y_I = 1 in each R_I, so each x_I is a unit. Conversely, if each x_I is a unit, the inverses y_I = x_I^{-1} are compatible (since φ_{I→J}(x_I^{-1}) = φ_{I→J}(x_I)^{-1} = x_J^{-1}). Thus y = (y_I)_I ∈ R and x y = 1.

Proposition P1 (Laurent-polynomial units are monomials). If g ∈ ℤ[q, q^{-1}] is a unit in ℤ[q]^ℕ, then g = ± q^i.
Proof. Write g = q^i h with i ∈ ℤ and h ∈ ℤ[q], and choose i minimal so that h(0) ≠ 0. The injective map ℤ[q]^ℕ → ℤ[[q−1]] (Theorem~(thm:13) with ζ = 1) implies g is a unit in ℤ[[q−1]], hence the constant term of q^{-i} g in ℤ[[q−1]] is ±1, i.e., h(1) = ±1. If h is not the constant ±1, pick a prime p not dividing h(0) (possible since h(0) ≠ 0). Over 𝔽_p, the reduction ĥ ∈ 𝔽_p[q] is nonconstant with nonzero constant term, hence has some root α ≠ 0 in an extension 𝔽_{p^f}. Let n = ord(α) in 𝔽_{p^f}^×. Then α is a primitive n-th root of unity in characteristic p, so α is a root of Φ_n modulo p. Thus the ring map θ: ℤ[q]/(Φ_n) → 𝔽_{p^f} sending q ↦ α (factoring through ℤ/p) is well-defined. We have θ(h) = 0, hence θ(g) = θ(q^i)θ(h) = 0. If g were a unit in ℤ[q]/(Φ_n), then θ(g) would be a unit in 𝔽_{p^f}, contradiction. By L0, g cannot be a unit in the inverse limit ℤ[q]^ℕ. Therefore h = ±1 and g = ± q^i.

Corollary C1 (Alternating units are not Habiro-units). For odd m ≥ 3, γ_m(q) = ∑_{j=0}^{m−1} (−1)^j q^j is not a unit in ℤ[q]^ℕ.
Proof. γ_m ∈ ℤ[q] is not a monomial; apply P1.

Proposition P2 (Torsion units are ±1). If u ∈ ℤ[q]^ℕ satisfies u^m = 1 for some m ≥ 1, then u = ±1.
Proof. Embed ℤ[q]^ℕ → ℤ[[q−1]] (Theorem~(thm:13) with ζ=1). In ℤ[[q−1]], write u = c + higher terms with c ∈ {±1} (units must have unit constant term). If c = 1 and u^m = 1, then passing to 𝔔[[q−1]] we apply the formal logarithm: log u is well-defined (since u ≡ 1 mod (q−1)) and m log u = log(u^m) = 0, hence log u = 0 and u = 1. If c = −1 and u^m = 1, then m must be even; then (−u) has constant term 1 and (−u)^m = 1, so (−u) = 1 by the previous case, hence u = −1.

Proposition P3 (p-adic congruence along μ_{p^∞}). Let p be odd. For any unit u ∈ ℤ[q]^ℕ and any primitive ζ of order p^a, u(ζ) ≡ u(1) mod p in ℤ[ζ].
Proof. In ℤ[ζ], the unique prime above p is generated by (1 − ζ) and ζ ≡ 1 mod p. For any f ∈ ℤ[q], f(ζ) ≡ f(1) mod p. The evaluation map ev_ζ: ℤ[q]^ℕ → ℤ[ζ] is a ring homomorphism (paper’s Section 5). Reduce u modulo p: every “Habiro basis” term (q)_n(ζ) = ∏_{k=1}^n(1−ζ^k) is divisible by 1−ζ, hence by p, for n ≥ 1; thus u(ζ) ≡ a_0(ζ) mod p, where a_0 is the image of u in ℤ[q]/(1−q), i.e., a_0(ζ) ≡ u(1) mod p. Therefore u(ζ) ≡ u(1) mod p.

Proposition P4 (Rigidity from infinitely many exact matches). Let u ∈ U(ℤ[q]^ℕ). If there exists i ∈ ℤ and an infinite set Z of roots of unity of prime-power order such that u(ζ) = ± ζ^i for all ζ ∈ Z, then u = ± q^i.
Proof. Consider w(q) = u(q)/(± q^i). Then w(ζ) = 1 for all ζ ∈ Z. The paper’s Theorem~(thm:2) says the evaluation map τ^ℤ_{ℕ,Z}: ℤ[q]^ℕ → ∏_{ζ∈Z} ℤ[ζ] is injective when Z contains infinitely many prime-power orders. Hence w = 1.

Examples
- γ_m are units modulo (q^n−1) for (n, 2m)=1 (as in the paper’s Remark), but P1 shows they are not units in ℤ[q]^ℕ.
- For u(q) = ± q^i(1 + (q−1)), u is a unit in ℤ[[q−1]] but not in ℤ[q]^ℕ by P1 (since u is Laurent polynomial and non-monomial).

Obstacles
- Turning the congruence u(ζ_{p^a}) ≡ u(1) mod p (P3) into exact equalities u(ζ_{p^a}) = u(1) for infinitely many a (or u(ζ_{p^a}) = ± ζ_{p^a}^i for a fixed i) remains the key difficulty. One expects growing (1−ζ_{p^a})-adic valuations as a → ∞ to force stabilization, but a clean argument is still missing.
- The previously proposed “chain injectivity” (using divisibility chains of orders) contained a gap (discarding a nonvanishing term mod Φ_n); we do not use it.

Next steps
- Prime-power towers: For fixed odd p, analyze u in ℤ_p[ζ_{p^a}][[q−ζ_{p^a}]] via σ_{ℕ,ζ} (Theorem~(thm:13)). Aim: show v_{(1−ζ_{p^a})}(u(ζ_{p^a})/u(1) − 1) → ∞ as a → ∞, then apply p-adic unit structure in ℤ_p(ζ_{p^a}) to force u(ζ_{p^a}) = u(1) for infinitely many a.
- Two-prime synthesis: If the previous step yields u(ζ_{p^a}) = u(1) for infinitely many a and likewise for another odd prime q, injectivity of τ over Z = {ζ_{p^a}} ∪ {ζ_{q^b}} (Theorem~(thm:2)) would imply u(q) = u(1). Normalizing u(1)=±1, combine with values at −1 to force u = ± q^i.
- Refine P3 to higher congruences: attempt to prove u(ζ_{p^a}) ≡ u(1) mod p^t for t depending on a and the Habiro expansion depth, to enable Hensel-type lifts.
- Explore “value rigidity” patterns: If u(ζ_p) ∈ μ_{p−1} for infinitely many primes p, show there is a fixed i with u(ζ_p) = ± ζ_p^i for infinitely many p, then apply P4.

Concluding remark
Conjecture 7.2 remains open here, but P1–P4 remove several potential classes of counterexamples and clarify the path: obtain infinitely many exact monomial evaluations and invoke τ-injectivity. I can formalize any of the above steps for inclusion in proofs.md on request.
