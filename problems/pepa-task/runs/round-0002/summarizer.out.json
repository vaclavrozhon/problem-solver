  "summary_md": "Round 1: No actionable statement of Conjecture 7.2 was provided, so no proof or disproof could be attempted. I requested the verbatim conjecture plus all dependent definitions/notation, subject-area context, any known special cases/partial results, and computational constraints. I proposed a six-step workflow to proceed once the statement is available (formalize, sanity checks, counterexample search, structural reductions, proof avenues, documentation) and recorded a risk register (boundary/degenerate counterexamples, hidden assumptions, non-equivalent reformulations). Immediate next action is to await the requested information and then execute the proposed steps. No main results or rigorous proofs were produced in this round.",
  "highlights": [
    "No actionable statement: Conjecture 7.2 was not provided, so proof/disproof/audit could not proceed.",
    "Requested RFI: verbatim conjecture (with quantifiers), all dependent definitions/notation, subject-area/context, known special cases/partial results, and computational constraints.",
    "Proposed six-step workflow on receipt: (1) formalize; (2) sanity checks; (3) counterexample search; (4) structural approach/reductions; (5) map proof techniques; (6) document verified results separately.",
    "Risk register noted key failure modes: boundary/degenerate counterexamples, reliance on unstated regularity/positivity, and invalid reformulation assumptions.",
    "Immediate next action: await the exact statement and supporting material; then run formalization, sanity checks, and targeted counterexample search before attempting proofs.",
    "Citations: 'Round 1 \u2014 Setup and Missing Information' and 'Research Notes' sections from the provided round file."

  "next_questions": [
    "Please provide the verbatim text of Conjecture 7.2, including all hypotheses, variable ranges, and quantifiers.",
    "Please supply all definitions/notation from earlier sections that 7.2 depends on, the subject-area/context, and any known special cases or previously verified instances.",
    "Please state computational preferences/constraints for small-case exploration (allowed tools, instance sizes, time limits) if you want an automated counterexample search."
