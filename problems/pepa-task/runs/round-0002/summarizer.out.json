  "summary_md": "Round summary: focused on Conjecture 7.2 (units of Habiro ring Z[q]^N are exactly \u00b1q^i). Proven/established: torsion units are \u00b11; for odd p one has p-adic congruence u(\u03b6_{p^a})\u2261u(1) (mod p); corrected rigidity: if a unit equals \u00b1\u03b6^i at infinitely many prime-power roots then it is \u00b1q^i. New milestone: any Laurent polynomial unit in Z[q]^N is \u00b1q^i (finite-field reduction proof), which yields \u03b3_m (odd m\u22653) are not units. Main open bottleneck: no current method to upgrade p-adic congruences to infinitely many exact equalities u(\u03b6)=\u00b1\u03b6^i (e.g., along \u03bc_{p^\u221e}). Working plan: p-adic tower analysis and combining two primes to force infinite exact matches. Citations: proofs.md, papers/paper1.tex.",
