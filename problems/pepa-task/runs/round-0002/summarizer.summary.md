Round summary: focused on Conjecture 7.2 (units of Habiro ring Z[q]^N are exactly ±q^i). Proven/established: torsion units are ±1; for odd p one has p-adic congruence u(ζ_{p^a})≡u(1) (mod p); corrected rigidity: if a unit equals ±ζ^i at infinitely many prime-power roots then it is ±q^i. New milestone: any Laurent polynomial unit in Z[q]^N is ±q^i (finite-field reduction proof), which yields γ_m (odd m≥3) are not units. Main open bottleneck: no current method to upgrade p-adic congruences to infinitely many exact equalities u(ζ)=±ζ^i (e.g., along μ_{p^∞}). Working plan: p-adic tower analysis and combining two primes to force infinite exact matches. Citations: proofs.md, papers/paper1.tex.
