Round 1: No actionable statement of Conjecture 7.2 was provided, so no proof or disproof could be attempted. I requested the verbatim conjecture plus all dependent definitions/notation, subject-area context, any known special cases/partial results, and computational constraints. I proposed a six-step workflow to proceed once the statement is available (formalize, sanity checks, counterexample search, structural reductions, proof avenues, documentation) and recorded a risk register (boundary/degenerate counterexamples, hidden assumptions, non-equivalent reformulations). Immediate next action is to await the requested information and then execute the proposed steps. No main results or rigorous proofs were produced in this round.
