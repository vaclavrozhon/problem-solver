If this is not the intended statement, please clarify.\n\nAudit highlights\n- Prover 1: Solid structure. Torsion-units and p-adic congruences are correct. The rigidity lemma is correct when using Theorem 2 (injectivity over an infinite set of roots containing infinitely many prime powers). Your Laurent-polynomial result is right in spirit, but the Mahler-measure/resolvent route is heavier than needed. Prefer the simpler finite-field reduction proof (see below) for proofs.md. Your normalization v(1)=v(\u22121)=1 via multiplying by \u03b5 q^i is correct. The truncation/resultant plan is interesting but presently nonrigorous.\n- Prover 2: Correct necessary conditions; \u03b3_m non-unit argument via \u03b6 with p|m is fine, though a simpler check at q=\u22121 suffices. Resultant/height suggestions are plausible for Laurent polynomials; we now have a complete proof of that case (see P3).\n- Prover 3: The new Proposition P1 (Laurent-polynomial units are monomials) is correct and elegant. The proof via reduction mod p, choosing a nonzero root \u03b1 and n=ord(\u03b1), then mapping \u2124[q]/(\u03a6_n) \u2192 \ud835\udd3d_{p^f} to show noninvertibility in a finite quotient, is rigorous. P2\u2013P4 match earlier verified lemmas. You correctly abandoned the flawed \u201cchain-injectivity\u201d idea from the previous round.\n\nWhat advances: We can now place in proofs.md a complete proof that \u2124[q,q^{-1}]\u2229U(\u2124[q]^\u2115) = {\u00b1q^i}. This removes a key caveat in the notes. \u03b3_m non-units follow instantly.\n\nBlocking gap: The main conjecture still hinges on producing infinitely many exact monomial evaluations u(\u03b6)=\u00b1\u03b6^i (e.g., along \u03bc_{p^\u221e}). Current p-adic congruences modulo p fall short of exact equalities.\n\nNext steps (concrete)\n- Formalize and include the simple proof of the Laurent-polynomial case (P1) in proofs.md; record \u03b3_m non-units as a corollary.\n- For a fixed odd p, attempt a Z_p-analysis of v=\u03b5 q^{-i}u with v(1)=v(\u22121)=1: study valuations of v(\u03b6_{p^a})\u22121 in \u2124_p(\u03b6_{p^a}), aiming to force v(\u03b6_{p^a})=1 for infinitely many a (Hensel-type lifting across increasing a). Combine two primes and apply the rigidity lemma.\n- Alternatively, seek a criterion that for infinitely many primes \u2113, u(\u03b6_\u2113) lies in {\u00b1\u03b6_\u2113^i}; then conclude via \u03c4-injectivity.\n",

We will use the finite-field reduction proof (see proofs.md), which also immediately implies that the alternating sums \u03b3_m are not units.

The p-adic congruence u(\u03b6_{p^a}) \u2261 u(1) (mod p) is insufficient; we need upgrades to exact equalities at infinitely many levels.\n\nWorking plan:\n- p-adic tower analysis: For fixed odd p, normalize v=\u03b5 q^{-i}u with v(1)=v(\u22121)=1. Study v(\u03b6_{p^a}) in Z_p(\u03b6_{p^a}) using \u03c3_{N,\u03b6}.

Then x \u2208 R is a unit iff each image x_I \u2208 R_I is a unit.\nProof. If xy=1 in R then x_I y_I=1 in each R_I. Conversely, if each x_I is a unit, then the inverses y_I=x_I^{-1} are compatible; y=(y_I)_I \u2208 R and xy=1. \u220e\n\nProposition (Laurent-polynomial Habiro-units are monomials). If g \u2208 Z[q,q^{-1}] is a unit in Z[q]^N, then g = \u00b1 q^i for some i \u2208 Z.\nProof. Write g=q^i h with i\u2208Z and h\u2208Z[q], chosen so that h(0)\u22600. Suppose h is not \u00b11. Choose a prime p such that p \u2224 h(0) and h mod p is nonconstant. Over a finite extension F_{p^f}, pick a nonzero root \u03b1 of \u0125 (the reduction of h). Let n=ord(\u03b1) in F_{p^f}^\u00d7; then p \u2224 n and \u03b1 is a primitive n-th root of unity in characteristic p, hence a root of the reduction of \u03a6_n. The map \u03b8: Z[q]/(\u03a6_n) \u2192 F_{p^f} induced by reduction mod p and q\u21a6\u03b1 is a ring homomorphism with \u03b8(h)=0, hence \u03b8(g)=\u03b8(q^i)\u03b8(h)=0. Therefore the image of g in Z[q]/(\u03a6_n) is not a unit. By the inverse-limit lemma, g cannot be a unit in Z[q]^N. Contradiction. Hence h=\u00b11 and g=\u00b1q^i. \u220e\n\nCorollary (Alternating sums are not Habiro-units). For odd m\u22653, \u03b3_m(q)=\u2211_{j=0}^{m\u22121}(\u22121)^j q^j \u2209 U(Z[q]^N).\nProof. Evaluate at q=\u22121: \u03b3_m(\u22121)=m\u2260\u00b11. Units map to units under evaluation Z[q]^N\u2192Z, so \u03b3_m is not a unit. \u220e"
