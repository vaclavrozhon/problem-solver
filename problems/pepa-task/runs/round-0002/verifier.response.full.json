I'm thinking about how in characteristic p, the n-th cyclotomic polynomial splits into a product of irreducibles. This is true as long as p doesn\u2019t divide n, which is an interesting restriction.

Even if it factors modulo p, all primitive n-th roots remain roots of the reduction of \u03a6_n.

If this is not the intended statement, please clarify.\\n\\nAudit highlights\\n- Prover 1: Solid structure. Torsion-units and p-adic congruences are correct. The rigidity lemma is correct when using Theorem 2 (injectivity over an infinite set of roots containing infinitely many prime powers). Your Laurent-polynomial result is right in spirit, but the Mahler-measure/resolvent route is heavier than needed. Prefer the simpler finite-field reduction proof (see below) for proofs.md. Your normalization v(1)=v(\u22121)=1 via multiplying by \u03b5 q^i is correct. The truncation/resultant plan is interesting but presently nonrigorous.\\n- Prover 2: Correct necessary conditions; \u03b3_m non-unit argument via \u03b6 with p|m is fine, though a simpler check at q=\u22121 suffices. Resultant/height suggestions are plausible for Laurent polynomials; we now have a complete proof of that case (see P3).\\n- Prover 3: The new Proposition P1 (Laurent-polynomial units are monomials) is correct and elegant. The proof via reduction mod p, choosing a nonzero root \u03b1 and n=ord(\u03b1), then mapping \u2124[q]/(\u03a6_n) \u2192 \ud835\udd3d_{p^f} to show noninvertibility in a finite quotient, is rigorous. P2\u2013P4 match earlier verified lemmas. You correctly abandoned the flawed \u201cchain-injectivity\u201d idea from the previous round.\\n\\nWhat advances: We can now place in proofs.md a complete proof that \u2124[q,q^{-1}]\u2229U(\u2124[q]^\u2115) = {\u00b1q^i}. This removes a key caveat in the notes. \u03b3_m non-units follow instantly.\\n\\nBlocking gap: The main conjecture still hinges on producing infinitely many exact monomial evaluations u(\u03b6)=\u00b1\u03b6^i (e.g., along \u03bc_{p^\u221e}). Current p-adic congruences modulo p fall short of exact equalities.\\n\\nNext steps (concrete)\\n- Formalize and include the simple proof of the Laurent-polynomial case (P1) in proofs.md; record \u03b3_m non-units as a corollary.\\n- For a fixed odd p, attempt a Z_p-analysis of v=\u03b5 q^{-i}u with v(1)=v(\u22121)=1: study valuations of v(\u03b6_{p^a})\u22121 in \u2124_p(\u03b6_{p^a}), aiming to force v(\u03b6_{p^a})=1 for infinitely many a (Hensel-type lifting across increasing a). Combine two primes and apply the rigidity lemma.\\n- Alternatively, seek a criterion that for infinitely many primes \u2113, u(\u03b6_\u2113) lies in {\u00b1\u03b6_\u2113^i}; then conclude via \u03c4-injectivity.\\n\",\"summary_md\":\"We focused on Habiro\u2019s units conjecture.

If g \u2208 Z[q,q^{-1}] is a unit in Z[q]^N, then g = \u00b1 q^i for some i \u2208 Z.\\nProof. Write g=q^i h with i\u2208Z and h\u2208Z[q], chosen so that h(0)\u22600. Suppose h is not \u00b11.
