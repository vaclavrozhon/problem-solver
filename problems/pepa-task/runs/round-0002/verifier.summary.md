We focused on Habiro’s units conjecture. Verified results: torsion units are ±1; p-adic congruence u(ζ_{p^a})≡u(1) mod p (odd p); rigidity: infinitely many exact monomial evaluations imply u=±q^i. New: a complete, clean proof that ℤ[q,q^{-1}]∩U(ℤ[q]^ℕ)={±q^i} (via reduction mod p and Φ_n), yielding γ_m non-units. Remaining obstacle: upgrading p-adic congruences to infinitely many exact equalities along μ_{p^∞}. Verdict: uncertain.
