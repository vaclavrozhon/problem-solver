  "feedback_md": "We cannot audit or advance the proof/disproof of Conjecture 7.2 because the precise statement, its hypotheses, and the surrounding definitions are missing. Without the exact formulation (including quantifiers, parameter ranges, and referenced notation), any attempt to prove or refute risks targeting the wrong problem. There are also no prover outputs to evaluate for correctness.\n\nImmediate needs:\n- Exact text of Conjecture 7.2, including all assumptions, variable domains, and any cross-references to earlier definitions or lemmas.\n- Context: subject area (e.g., combinatorics, number theory, analysis, geometry), and the role of the conjecture within the broader work (e.g., strengthening of Lemma X, equivalence to Problem Y, etc.).\n- Known partial results or special cases that may already be established in the text.\n\nAudit checklist to apply once the statement is available:\n1) Sanity checks: boundary cases, degenerate configurations, trivial obstructions (e.g., n=0/1, empty or complete structures, extremal parameter values, parity/modular constraints).\n2) Counterexample search: enumerate small instances with clear stopping rules; record any violating examples or confirm tightness of bounds.\n3) Structural reductions: attempt to reduce to simpler subcases (monotonicity, subadditivity, closure properties), or normalize via canonical forms.\n4) Tooling: choose appropriate engines (Sage/Pari for number theory, NetworkX/SAT/ILP for combinatorics/graphs, SDP/convexity tools for inequalities) to automate small cases.\n5) Proof avenues: identify applicable standard theorems (compactness, extremal principles, regularity lemmas, concentration inequalities, spectral bounds, convexity/majorization) and check compatibility with the conjecture’s hypotheses.\n\nConcrete next steps for provers:\n- Provide the verbatim statement of Conjecture 7.2 plus any required definitions/notation from earlier sections.\n- If available, list known special cases, related conjectures, or equivalent formulations.\n- Once provided, split work: (A) formalize and normalize the conjecture and derive immediate necessary conditions; (B) build a small-instance search harness to test for counterexamples; (C) attempt first structural lemmas that would make an induction or decomposition feasible.\n\nUntil we have the statement and context, adding to proofs.md or output.md would be premature.",

We cannot proceed with proof/disproof or auditing without it.\n\nRequested information (RFI):\n- Verbatim text of Conjecture 7.2, including all hypotheses, variable ranges, and quantifiers.\n- Definitions/notation from earlier sections that 7.2 depends on.\n- Subject area/context (e.g., combinatorics, number theory, analysis, geometry) and the role of 7.2.\n- Any known special cases, partial results, or previously verified instances.\n- Computational constraints (time/space limits) for small-case exploration if needed.\n\nProposed workflow once 7.2 is provided:\n1) Formalization: Rewrite the conjecture precisely; isolate parameters; identify implicit assumptions.\n2) Sanity checks: Evaluate trivial/edge cases (small n, degenerate structures, extremal parameter values). Record any immediate necessary conditions.\n3) Counterexample search: Design a small-instance enumeration/testing harness tailored to the domain (e.g., Sage/Pari for arithmetic, NetworkX/SAT/ILP for graphs/combinatorics). Define stopping criteria and logging format.\n4) Structural approach: Attempt reductions (monotonicity, subadditivity, hereditary properties), identify invariants, and explore canonical forms.\n5) Proof avenues: Map applicable standard techniques (e.g., compactness, extremal combinatorics, spectral bounds, convexity/majorization, regularity, concentration inequalities). Draft candidate lemmas.\n6) Documentation: Keep clean separation—exploratory notes here; fully-verified results in proofs.md; only major milestones in output.md.\n\nRisk register (potential failure modes to test early):\n- Boundary/degenerate counterexamples violating hidden assumptions.\n- Dependence on non-stated regularity/positivity conditions.\n- Non-equivalence between common reformulations (ensure implications are two-sided before using them).\n\nNext actions pending RFI:\n- Await the exact statement and definitions.\n- Once received, immediately execute steps (1)–(3), then triage based on findings."
