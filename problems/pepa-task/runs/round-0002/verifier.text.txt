{"feedback_md":"Target. We assume Conjecture 7.2 is Habiro’s units conjecture U(ℤ[q]^ℕ) = {±q^i}. If this is not the intended statement, please clarify.\n\nAudit highlights\n- Prover 1: Solid structure. Torsion-units and p-adic congruences are correct. The rigidity lemma is correct when using Theorem 2 (injectivity over an infinite set of roots containing infinitely many prime powers). Your Laurent-polynomial result is right in spirit, but the Mahler-measure/resolvent route is heavier than needed. Prefer the simpler finite-field reduction proof (see below) for proofs.md. Your normalization v(1)=v(−1)=1 via multiplying by ε q^i is correct. The truncation/resultant plan is interesting but presently nonrigorous.\n- Prover 2: Correct necessary conditions; γ_m non-unit argument via ζ with p|m is fine, though a simpler check at q=−1 suffices. Resultant/height suggestions are plausible for Laurent polynomials; we now have a complete proof of that case (see P3).\n- Prover 3: The new Proposition P1 (Laurent-polynomial units are monomials) is correct and elegant. The proof via reduction mod p, choosing a nonzero root α and n=ord(α), then mapping ℤ[q]/(Φ_n) → 𝔽_{p^f} to show noninvertibility in a finite quotient, is rigorous. P2–P4 match earlier verified lemmas. You correctly abandoned the flawed “chain-injectivity” idea from the previous round.\n\nWhat advances: We can now place in proofs.md a complete proof that ℤ[q,q^{-1}]∩U(ℤ[q]^ℕ) = {±q^i}. This removes a key caveat in the notes. γ_m non-units follow instantly.\n\nBlocking gap: The main conjecture still hinges on producing infinitely many exact monomial evaluations u(ζ)=±ζ^i (e.g., along μ_{p^∞}). Current p-adic congruences modulo p fall short of exact equalities.\n\nNext steps (concrete)\n- Formalize and include the simple proof of the Laurent-polynomial case (P1) in proofs.md; record γ_m non-units as a corollary.\n- For a fixed odd p, attempt a Z_p-analysis of v=ε q^{-i}u with v(1)=v(−1)=1: study valuations of v(ζ_{p^a})−1 in ℤ_p(ζ_{p^a}), aiming to force v(ζ_{p^a})=1 for infinitely many a (Hensel-type lifting across increasing a). Combine two primes and apply the rigidity lemma.\n- Alternatively, seek a criterion that for infinitely many primes ℓ, u(ζ_ℓ) lies in {±ζ_ℓ^i}; then conclude via τ-injectivity.\n","summary_md":"We focused on Habiro’s units conjecture.

Let (R_I)_I be an inverse system of rings with surjective transition maps and R = lim← R_I. Then x ∈ R is a unit iff each image x_I ∈ R_I is a unit.\nProof. If xy=1 in R then x_I y_I=1 in each R_I. Conversely, if each x_I is a unit, then the inverses y_I=x_I^{-1} are compatible; y=(y_I)_I ∈ R and xy=1. ∎\n\nProposition (Laurent-polynomial Habiro-units are monomials). If g ∈ Z[q,q^{-1}] is a unit in Z[q]^N, then g = ± q^i for some i ∈ Z.\nProof. Write g=q^i h with i∈Z and h∈Z[q], chosen so that h(0)≠0. Suppose h is not ±1. Choose a prime p such that p ∤ h(0) and h mod p is nonconstant. Over a finite extension F_{p^f}, pick a nonzero root α of ĥ (the reduction of h). Let n=ord(α) in F_{p^f}^×; then p ∤ n and α is a primitive n-th root of unity in characteristic p, hence a root of the reduction of Φ_n. The map θ: Z[q]/(Φ_n) → F_{p^f} induced by reduction mod p and q↦α is a ring homomorphism with θ(h)=0, hence θ(g)=θ(q^i)θ(h)=0. Therefore the image of g in Z[q]/(Φ_n) is not a unit. By the inverse-limit lemma, g cannot be a unit in Z[q]^N. Contradiction. Hence h=±1 and g=±q^i. ∎\n\nCorollary (Alternating sums are not Habiro-units). For odd m≥3, γ_m(q)=∑_{j=0}^{m−1}(−1)^j q^j ∉ U(Z[q]^N).\nProof. Evaluate at q=−1: γ_m(−1)=m≠±1. Units map to units under evaluation Z[q]^N→Z, so γ_m is not a unit. ∎"},"output_update":null}
