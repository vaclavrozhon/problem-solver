These will serve toward a p-adic rigidity step needed to finish the conjecture.\n\n\nMilestone A. Laurent-polynomial units are monomials\nProposition A.1. If g \u2208 \u2124[q,q^{\u22121}] is a unit in \u2124\u0302[q], then g = \u00b1 q^i.\n\nProof. Write g(q)=\u2211_{i=r}^s c_i q^i with c_r,c_s\u22600 and (assume for contradiction) g not a monomial. Choose M=\u2212r and set f(x)=x^M g(x)\u2208\u2124[x]; then f is primitive and not a monomial. By Schur\u2019s theorem, there exist infinitely many primes p for which f has a root in \ud835\udd3d_p; among them, infinitely many p do not divide the constant term c_r, hence we can choose p and \u03b1\u2208\ud835\udd3d_p^\u00d7 with f(\u03b1)=0. Let n=ord(\u03b1) in \ud835\udd3d\u0304_p^\u00d7; then p\u2224n and \u03b1 is an n-th root of unity in characteristic p.\n\nBy cyclotomic theory, there is a prime ideal \ud835\udd2d of \u2124[\u03b6_n] above p such that \u03b6_n\u21a6\u03b1 in the residue field (of degree f=ord_n(p)); consequently, f(\u03b6_n)\u22610 (mod \ud835\udd2d), hence g(\u03b6_n)\u22610 (mod \ud835\udd2d). If g were a unit in \u2124\u0302[q], then its component in \u2124[q]/(\u03a6_n)\u2245\u2124[\u03b6_n] would be a unit; reduction mod \ud835\udd2d would remain a unit in a finite field. But g(\u03b6_n)\u22610 (mod \ud835\udd2d) contradicts invertibility. Hence g is not a unit unless it is a monomial. Since U(\u2124[q,q^{\u22121}])={\u00b1q^i}, the claim follows. \u220e\n\nCorollary A.2. For odd m\u22653, \u03b3_m(q):=\u2211_{j=0}^{m\u22121} (\u22121)^j q^j is not a unit in \u2124\u0302[q] (indeed \u03b3_m(\u22121)=m\u2209{\u00b11}).\n\nWhy useful. This eliminates a large class of potential counterexamples and removes the \u201cLaurent polynomial\u201d caveat.\n\n\np-adic evaluation and truncation control\nWe work p-adically at p\u22653.\n\nLemma B.1 (valuation of 1\u2212\u03b6^k). Let \u03b6 be a primitive p^a-th root of unity in K=\u211a_p(\u03b6), with normalized valuation v_p(p)=1. For 0\u2264s<a and k=p^s m (p\u2224m),\n\nv_p(\u03b6^k \u2212 1) = v_p(\u03b6 \u2212 1) + s.\n\nSketch. Write \u03b6=1+\u03c0 with v_p(\u03c0)>0. Since p\u2224m, v_p((1+\u03c0)^m\u22121)=v_p(\u03c0). Then\n(1+\u03c0)^{p^s}\u22121 = ((1+\u03c0)^m)^{p^s}\u22121 = (1+u)^{p^s}\u22121 with u=(1+\u03c0)^m\u22121 and v_p(u)=v_p(\u03c0). The lifting-of-exponent (for p odd) gives v_p((1+u)^{p^s}\u22121)=v_p(u)+s. \u220e\n\nProposition B.2 (valuation of (\u03b6)_n). Let \u03b6 be as above and 0\u2264n<p^a. Then\n\nv_p((\u03b6)_n) = v_p(\u220f_{k=1}^n (1\u2212\u03b6^k)) = n\u00b7v_p(\u03b6\u22121) + v_p(n!) \u2265 v_p(n!).\n\nProof. Sum Lemma B.1 over k=1,\u2026,n observing \u03bd_p(k)=s for k=p^s m, p\u2224m, and 0\u2264s<a since n<p^a. \u220e\n\nCorollary B.3 (uniform truncation modulo p^r). Fix r\u22651. Let N=N(r):=min{n\u22650 | v_p(n!) \u2265 r}. For any a\u22651 and any primitive p^a-th root \u03b6,\n\nu(\u03b6) \u2261 \u2211_{n=0}^{N\u22121} a_n(\u03b6) (\u03b6)_n mod p^r in \u2124_p(\u03b6),\n\nfor every u(q)=\u2211_{n\u22650} a_n(q) (q)_n \u2208 \u2124\u0302[q].\n\nProof. For n\u2265N we have v_p((\u03b6)_n)\u2265v_p(n!)\u2265r by Proposition B.2. \u220e\n\nWhy useful. This isolates a finite truncation (independent of the level a) controlling u(\u03b6) modulo p^r. It is a quantitative p-adic continuity tool along the \u03bc_{p^\u221e}-tower.\n\n\nRigidity trigger via exact matches (recall)\nLemma C.1 (rigidity). If u\u2208U(\u2124\u0302[q]) satisfies u(\u03b6)=\u00b1\u03b6^i for infinitely many roots of unity \u03b6 with prime-power orders, then u=\u00b1q^i.\n\nProof. Let Z be that infinite set. The evaluation map \u03c4_{\u2115,Z}:\u2124\u0302[q]\u2192\u220f_{\u03b6\u2208Z}\u2124[\u03b6] is injective (paper Thm 2). The element w=\u00b1q^{\u2212i}u maps to 1 on Z, hence w=1. \u220e\n\n\nIdeas toward the full conjecture\n- Normalize: For u\u2208U(\u2124\u0302[q]) pick \u03b5\u2208{\u00b11} and i\u2208\u2124 with v(q):=\u03b5 q^{\u2212i}u(q) satisfying v(1)=v(\u22121)=1. Proving v=1 suffices.\n- p-adic tower strategy: Fix odd p. By Corollary B.3, v(\u03b6_{p^a}) mod p^r is determined by a finite truncation independent of a. Aim: show that for some r and infinitely many a, this truncation equals 1 in \u2124_p(\u03b6_{p^a}), forcing v(\u03b6_{p^a})=1 for infinitely many a. Then Lemma C.1 gives u=\u00b1q^i.\n- Compatibility heuristic: Lemma B.1 suggests that higher n-terms in the Habiro expansion of v acquire rapidly growing p-adic valuation uniformly along \u03bc_{p^\u221e}. This raises the prospect of a Hensel-like propagation of exact equalities v(\u03b6_{p^a})=1 at infinitely many levels a.\n\n\nObstacles and cautions\n- Passing from congruences v(\u03b6_{p^a})\u22611 (mod p) to exact equalities at infinitely many levels requires finer control; standard p-adic tools (Strassman, Hensel) need an analytic parameter, whereas our evaluation set is discrete (\u03bc_{p^\u221e}).\n- The truncation polynomial P_N(q)=\u2211_{n<N} a_n(q)(q)_n depends on the coefficients a_n(q); proving that P_N(\u03b6_{p^a})=1 for infinitely many a demands structural constraints on the a_n beyond valuation bounds.\n\n\nActionable next steps\n1) Formalize A.1 in proofs.md with the finite-field reduction argument, and add Corollary A.2 on \u03b3_m.\n2) Add Lemma B.1, Proposition B.2, and Corollary B.3 to proofs.md with complete details (including the lifting-of-exponent proof for p odd). These are elementary and verifiable.\n3) p-adic tower analysis: For normalized v, compute explicitly the first few truncations modulo p and p^2:\n   - mod p: v(\u03b6_{p^a})\u2261a_0(1)=1;\n   - mod p^2: v(\u03b6_{p^a})\u2261a_0(1) + a_1(1)(1\u22121) + \u22ef + a_{p\u22121}(1)\u220f_{k=1}^{p\u22121}(1\u22121^k) \u2261 1 (trivially). Extend to mod p^r using Corollary B.3 and constraints on a_n(1), a_n(\u22121), to search for a lifting pattern that forces v(\u03b6_{p^a})=1 at infinitely many a.\n4) Two-prime synthesis: Attempt to implement the above for two distinct odd primes; if for each p the set {a: v(\u03b6_{p^a})=1} is infinite, Lemma C.1 finishes the conjecture.\n\n\nSummary\n- Proven: Laurent-polynomial units in \u2124\u0302[q] are exactly \u00b1q^i. Alternating sums \u03b3_m are not units.\n- Established: sharp p-adic valuation bounds for (\u03b6)_n and a uniform truncation lemma controlling u(\u03b6_{p^a}) modulo p^r via finitely many coefficients, independent of the level a.\n- Remaining key step: produce infinitely many exact monomial evaluations u(\u03b6)=\u00b1\u03b6^i (e.g., along \u03bc_{p^\u221e}); the new p-adic tools set up a tractable route to attempt a lifting argument in the next round.\n"
