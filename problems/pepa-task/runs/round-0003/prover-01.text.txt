# Goal
Conjecture 7.2 (Habiro’s units): U(ℤ̂[q]) = {± q^i | i ∈ ℤ}, where ℤ̂[q]=ℤ[q]^ℕ is the Habiro ring.

Below are audited advances: a complete proof for Laurent-polynomial units, and p-adic valuation lemmas giving uniform control over evaluations at p-power roots of unity. These will serve toward a p-adic rigidity step needed to finish the conjecture.


Milestone A. Laurent-polynomial units are monomials
Proposition A.1. If g ∈ ℤ[q,q^{−1}] is a unit in ℤ̂[q], then g = ± q^i.

Proof. Write g(q)=∑_{i=r}^s c_i q^i with c_r,c_s≠0 and (assume for contradiction) g not a monomial. Choose M=−r and set f(x)=x^M g(x)∈ℤ[x]; then f is primitive and not a monomial. By Schur’s theorem, there exist infinitely many primes p for which f has a root in 𝔽_p; among them, infinitely many p do not divide the constant term c_r, hence we can choose p and α∈𝔽_p^× with f(α)=0. Let n=ord(α) in 𝔽̄_p^×; then p∤n and α is an n-th root of unity in characteristic p.

By cyclotomic theory, there is a prime ideal 𝔭 of ℤ[ζ_n] above p such that ζ_n↦α in the residue field (of degree f=ord_n(p)); consequently, f(ζ_n)≡0 (mod 𝔭), hence g(ζ_n)≡0 (mod 𝔭). If g were a unit in ℤ̂[q], then its component in ℤ[q]/(Φ_n)≅ℤ[ζ_n] would be a unit; reduction mod 𝔭 would remain a unit in a finite field. But g(ζ_n)≡0 (mod 𝔭) contradicts invertibility. Hence g is not a unit unless it is a monomial. Since U(ℤ[q,q^{−1}])={±q^i}, the claim follows. ∎

Corollary A.2. For odd m≥3, γ_m(q):=∑_{j=0}^{m−1} (−1)^j q^j is not a unit in ℤ̂[q] (indeed γ_m(−1)=m∉{±1}).

Why useful. This eliminates a large class of potential counterexamples and removes the “Laurent polynomial” caveat.


p-adic evaluation and truncation control
We work p-adically at p≥3.

Lemma B.1 (valuation of 1−ζ^k). Let ζ be a primitive p^a-th root of unity in K=ℚ_p(ζ), with normalized valuation v_p(p)=1. For 0≤s<a and k=p^s m (p∤m),

v_p(ζ^k − 1) = v_p(ζ − 1) + s.

Sketch. Write ζ=1+π with v_p(π)>0. Since p∤m, v_p((1+π)^m−1)=v_p(π). Then
(1+π)^{p^s}−1 = ((1+π)^m)^{p^s}−1 = (1+u)^{p^s}−1 with u=(1+π)^m−1 and v_p(u)=v_p(π). The lifting-of-exponent (for p odd) gives v_p((1+u)^{p^s}−1)=v_p(u)+s. ∎

Proposition B.2 (valuation of (ζ)_n). Let ζ be as above and 0≤n<p^a. Then

v_p((ζ)_n) = v_p(∏_{k=1}^n (1−ζ^k)) = n·v_p(ζ−1) + v_p(n!) ≥ v_p(n!).

Proof. Sum Lemma B.1 over k=1,…,n observing ν_p(k)=s for k=p^s m, p∤m, and 0≤s<a since n<p^a. ∎

Corollary B.3 (uniform truncation modulo p^r). Fix r≥1. Let N=N(r):=min{n≥0 | v_p(n!) ≥ r}. For any a≥1 and any primitive p^a-th root ζ,

u(ζ) ≡ ∑_{n=0}^{N−1} a_n(ζ) (ζ)_n mod p^r in ℤ_p(ζ),

for every u(q)=∑_{n≥0} a_n(q) (q)_n ∈ ℤ̂[q].

Proof. For n≥N we have v_p((ζ)_n)≥v_p(n!)≥r by Proposition B.2. ∎

Why useful. This isolates a finite truncation (independent of the level a) controlling u(ζ) modulo p^r. It is a quantitative p-adic continuity tool along the μ_{p^∞}-tower.


Rigidity trigger via exact matches (recall)
Lemma C.1 (rigidity). If u∈U(ℤ̂[q]) satisfies u(ζ)=±ζ^i for infinitely many roots of unity ζ with prime-power orders, then u=±q^i.

Proof. Let Z be that infinite set. The evaluation map τ_{ℕ,Z}:ℤ̂[q]→∏_{ζ∈Z}ℤ[ζ] is injective (paper Thm 2). The element w=±q^{−i}u maps to 1 on Z, hence w=1. ∎


Ideas toward the full conjecture
- Normalize: For u∈U(ℤ̂[q]) pick ε∈{±1} and i∈ℤ with v(q):=ε q^{−i}u(q) satisfying v(1)=v(−1)=1. Proving v=1 suffices.
- p-adic tower strategy: Fix odd p. By Corollary B.3, v(ζ_{p^a}) mod p^r is determined by a finite truncation independent of a. Aim: show that for some r and infinitely many a, this truncation equals 1 in ℤ_p(ζ_{p^a}), forcing v(ζ_{p^a})=1 for infinitely many a. Then Lemma C.1 gives u=±q^i.
- Compatibility heuristic: Lemma B.1 suggests that higher n-terms in the Habiro expansion of v acquire rapidly growing p-adic valuation uniformly along μ_{p^∞}. This raises the prospect of a Hensel-like propagation of exact equalities v(ζ_{p^a})=1 at infinitely many levels a.


Obstacles and cautions
- Passing from congruences v(ζ_{p^a})≡1 (mod p) to exact equalities at infinitely many levels requires finer control; standard p-adic tools (Strassman, Hensel) need an analytic parameter, whereas our evaluation set is discrete (μ_{p^∞}).
- The truncation polynomial P_N(q)=∑_{n<N} a_n(q)(q)_n depends on the coefficients a_n(q); proving that P_N(ζ_{p^a})=1 for infinitely many a demands structural constraints on the a_n beyond valuation bounds.


Actionable next steps
1) Formalize A.1 in proofs.md with the finite-field reduction argument, and add Corollary A.2 on γ_m.
2) Add Lemma B.1, Proposition B.2, and Corollary B.3 to proofs.md with complete details (including the lifting-of-exponent proof for p odd). These are elementary and verifiable.
3) p-adic tower analysis: For normalized v, compute explicitly the first few truncations modulo p and p^2:
   - mod p: v(ζ_{p^a})≡a_0(1)=1;
   - mod p^2: v(ζ_{p^a})≡a_0(1) + a_1(1)(1−1) + ⋯ + a_{p−1}(1)∏_{k=1}^{p−1}(1−1^k) ≡ 1 (trivially). Extend to mod p^r using Corollary B.3 and constraints on a_n(1), a_n(−1), to search for a lifting pattern that forces v(ζ_{p^a})=1 at infinitely many a.
4) Two-prime synthesis: Attempt to implement the above for two distinct odd primes; if for each p the set {a: v(ζ_{p^a})=1} is infinite, Lemma C.1 finishes the conjecture.


Summary
- Proven: Laurent-polynomial units in ℤ̂[q] are exactly ±q^i. Alternating sums γ_m are not units.
- Established: sharp p-adic valuation bounds for (ζ)_n and a uniform truncation lemma controlling u(ζ_{p^a}) modulo p^r via finitely many coefficients, independent of the level a.
- Remaining key step: produce infinitely many exact monomial evaluations u(ζ)=±ζ^i (e.g., along μ_{p^∞}); the new p-adic tools set up a tractable route to attempt a lifting argument in the next round.
