The units of the Habiro ring Z[q]^N are exactly {\u00b1 q^i | i \u2208 Z}.\\n\\nIdeas\\n- Settle the Laurent-polynomial case completely: if g \u2208 Z[q,q^{-1}] is a unit in Z[q]^N, then g = \u00b1 q^i. This removes a major family of potential counterexamples and also yields non-unit status for the alternating sums \u03b3_m.\\n- Record robust necessary conditions for units via evaluations and p-adic congruences. These are useful filters and structural constraints.\\n- A rigidity criterion using injectivity of \u03c4 over infinite sets of roots of unity provides a clear path to proving u = \u00b1 q^i once infinitely many exact monomial evaluations are produced.\\n- Outline a p-adic analytic approach (Strassman) that could yield the needed infinite exact matches along \u03bc_{p^\u221e}.\\n\\nRigorous results\\n\\nLemma 1 (Evaluation preserves units). For any root of unity \u03b6, the evaluation map ev_\u03b6: Z[q]^N \u2192 Z[\u03b6] is a ring homomorphism. Hence if u \u2208 U(Z[q]^N), then u(\u03b6) \u2208 U(Z[\u03b6]). In particular, u(1), u(\u22121) \u2208 {\u00b11}.\\nProof. Evaluation at a fixed \u03b6 is a component of \u03c4^Z_{N,{\u03b6}}. Ring homomorphisms send units to units.\\n\\nLemma 2 (Torsion units are trivial). If u \u2208 Z[q]^N satisfies u^m = 1 for some m \u2265 1, then u = \u00b11.\\nProof. Inject Z[q]^N into Z[[q\u22121]] (Theorem 13). In Z[[q\u22121]] write v = \u03c3(u) with v^m = 1. Let v = c(1+a), c \u2208 {\u00b11}, a \u2208 (q\u22121)Z[[q\u22121]]. If c = 1 then in Q[[q\u22121]]: 0 = log(v^m) = m log(v) \u21d2 v = 1. If c = \u22121 and m odd, impossible since constant term is \u22121; if m even, (1+a)^m = 1 \u21d2 v = \u22121. Pull back via \u03c3.\\n\\nLemma 3 (p-adic congruence along \u03bc_{p^\u221e}). Let p be odd and \u03b6 a primitive p^a-th root of unity. For any u \u2208 Z[q]^N, u(\u03b6) \u2261 u(1) (mod p) in Z[\u03b6].\\nProof. In Z_p[\u03b6], \u03b6 \u2261 1 mod p; for f \u2208 Z[q] we have f(\u03b6) \u2261 f(1) mod p, and passage to the inverse limit preserves the congruence.\\n\\nProposition 4 (Rigidity from infinitely many exact monomial evaluations). Let u \u2208 U(Z[q]^N). If there exist i \u2208 Z and an infinite set Z of roots of unity containing infinitely many of prime-power order such that u(\u03b6) = \u00b1 \u03b6^i for all \u03b6 \u2208 Z, then u = \u00b1 q^i.\\nProof. Consider w = (\u00b1)q^{\u2212i}u \u2208 Z[q]^N. Then w(\u03b6) = 1 for all \u03b6 \u2208 Z. By Theorem 2 (injectivity of \u03c4^Z_{N,Z} when Z contains infinitely many prime powers), w = 1.\\n\\nProposition 5 (Laurent-polynomial units are monomials). If g \u2208 Z[q,q^{\u22121}] is a unit in Z[q]^N, then g = \u00b1 q^i.\\nProof. Suppose g is not of the form \u00b1 q^i. Write h(q) = q^t g(q) \u2208 Z[q] with t minimal so that h is a polynomial with at least two nonzero terms. Since q is a unit in Z[q]^N (Proposition 6 in the paper), h is a unit in Z[q]^N as well. If h(1) \u2209 {\u00b11} or h(\u22121) \u2209 {\u00b11}, then by Lemma 1, the image of h in Z (resp. Z via q \u21a6 \u22121) is a nonunit, contradiction. Thus assume h(1), h(\u22121) \u2208 {\u00b11}. Choose a prime r such that r \u2224 h(0). For large r, |h(r)| > 1, and since r \u2224 h(0), we have r \u2224 h(r) (indeed h(r) \u2261 h(0) mod r). Let p be any prime divisor of h(r); then p \u2260 r, so \u03b1 := r mod p \u2208 F_p^\u00d7 is a nonzero root of h over F_p, i.e., h(\u03b1) \u2261 0 (mod p). Let n = ord_{F_p^\u00d7}(\u03b1). Then \u03b1 is a primitive n-th root of unity in F_p, hence \u03b1 is a root of \u03a6_n modulo p. Therefore gcd(h mod p, \u03a6_n mod p) \u2260 1, so the image of h in F_p[q]/(\u03a6_n) is 0, hence not a unit. Since Z[q]/(\u03a6_n) \u2192 F_p[q]/(\u03a6_n) is a ring homomorphism, the image of h in Z[q]/(\u03a6_n) is not a unit. But units in Z[q]^N map to units in every Z[q]/(f) in the projective system, contradiction. Hence g = \u00b1 q^i.\\n\\nCorollary 6 (Alternating sums are not units). For odd m \u2265 3, \u03b3_m(q) = \u2211_{i=0}^{m\u22121} (\u22121)^i q^i \u2209 U(Z[q]^N).\\nProof 1 (short). Evaluate at \u03b6 = \u22121 (order 2): \u03b3_m(\u22121) = \u2211 (\u22121)^i (\u22121)^i = m \u2260 \u00b11, contradicting Lemma 1.\\nProof 2 (alternative). If p | m is odd and \u03b6 is a primitive p-th root, then \u03b3_m(\u03b6) = (1+\u03b6^m)/(1+\u03b6) = 2/(1+\u03b6), and 1+\u03b6 is a cyclotomic unit in Z[\u03b6] while 2 is not a unit, so \u03b3_m(\u03b6) is not a unit.\\n\\nExamples\\n- Two-term Laurent polynomials: g(q) = a q^r + b q^s with |a|+|b| \u2265 2 are excluded by Lemma 1 unless g is \u00b1q^k. E.g., 2\u2212q: g(1)=1 but g(\u22121)=3.\\n- \u03b3_3(q) = 1 \u2212 q + q^2: \u03b3_3(\u22121)=3, so non-unit.\\n\\nObstacles\\n- The main conjecture reduces to showing that if u \u2208 U(Z[q]^N) then either (i) u \u2208 Z[q,q^{\u22121}] (now fully resolved) or (ii) one can produce infinitely many prime-power roots of unity \u03b6 with u(\u03b6) = \u00b1 \u03b6^i for a fixed i. Our current p-adic congruences (Lemma 3) give u(\u03b6_{p^a}) \u2261 u(1) (mod p) but do not force exact equalities for infinitely many a.\\n- A promising analytic route is via Strassman\u2019s theorem: embed Z[q]^N \u21aa Z_p[[q\u22121]] (Theorem 13). If v(q) = (\u00b1)q^{\u2212i}u(q) satisfies v(1)=1 and v(\u03b6_{p^a})=1 for infinitely many a, then v=1. The bottleneck is upgrading congruences v(\u03b6_{p^a}) \u2261 1 (mod p) to exact equalities at infinitely many levels.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Formalize a p-adic analytic criterion: prove that for v \u2208 1 + (q\u22121)Z_p[[q\u22121]] arising from Z[q]^N, the valuations v_p(v(\u03b6_{p^a})\u22121) grow with a. If one can find a fixed K with v(\u03b6_{p^a}) \u2261 1 (mod p^K) for infinitely many a, Hensel/Strassman may yield v \u2261 1 on \u03bc_{p^\u221e}.\\n- Two-prime synthesis: for two odd primes p, q, normalize v as above and attempt to extract the same exponent i from both towers using local expansions, then invoke Proposition 4.\\n- Explore resultant bounds: for general u, study Res(u_N, \u03a6_\u2113) for approximants u_N and large primes \u2113 to force infinitely many exact monomial evaluations.\\n\\nSummary\\n- Proven: torsion units are \u00b11; necessary evaluation constraints u(\u00b11)=\u00b11; p-adic congruence on \u03bc_{p^\u221e}; rigidity from infinitely many exact monomial evaluations; and a complete Laurent-polynomial classification: Z[q,q^{\u22121}] \u2229 U(Z[q]^N) = {\u00b1q^i}. As a corollary, the alternating sums \u03b3_m (odd m \u2265 3) are not units. The remaining challenge is to promote p-adic congruences to infinitely many exact equalities along a prime-power tower, for which a Strassman/Hensel strategy is proposed.\"}",
