Conjecture 7.2 (assumed). The units of the Habiro ring Z[q]^N are exactly {± q^i | i ∈ Z}.

Ideas
- Settle the Laurent-polynomial case completely: if g ∈ Z[q,q^{-1}] is a unit in Z[q]^N, then g = ± q^i. This removes a major family of potential counterexamples and also yields non-unit status for the alternating sums γ_m.
- Record robust necessary conditions for units via evaluations and p-adic congruences. These are useful filters and structural constraints.
- A rigidity criterion using injectivity of τ over infinite sets of roots of unity provides a clear path to proving u = ± q^i once infinitely many exact monomial evaluations are produced.
- Outline a p-adic analytic approach (Strassman) that could yield the needed infinite exact matches along μ_{p^∞}.

Rigorous results

Lemma 1 (Evaluation preserves units). For any root of unity ζ, the evaluation map ev_ζ: Z[q]^N → Z[ζ] is a ring homomorphism. Hence if u ∈ U(Z[q]^N), then u(ζ) ∈ U(Z[ζ]). In particular, u(1), u(−1) ∈ {±1}.
Proof. Evaluation at a fixed ζ is a component of τ^Z_{N,{ζ}}. Ring homomorphisms send units to units.

Lemma 2 (Torsion units are trivial). If u ∈ Z[q]^N satisfies u^m = 1 for some m ≥ 1, then u = ±1.
Proof. Inject Z[q]^N into Z[[q−1]] (Theorem 13). In Z[[q−1]] write v = σ(u) with v^m = 1. Let v = c(1+a), c ∈ {±1}, a ∈ (q−1)Z[[q−1]]. If c = 1 then in Q[[q−1]]: 0 = log(v^m) = m log(v) ⇒ v = 1. If c = −1 and m odd, impossible since constant term is −1; if m even, (1+a)^m = 1 ⇒ v = −1. Pull back via σ.

Lemma 3 (p-adic congruence along μ_{p^∞}). Let p be odd and ζ a primitive p^a-th root of unity. For any u ∈ Z[q]^N, u(ζ) ≡ u(1) (mod p) in Z[ζ].
Proof. In Z_p[ζ], ζ ≡ 1 mod p; for f ∈ Z[q] we have f(ζ) ≡ f(1) mod p, and passage to the inverse limit preserves the congruence.

Proposition 4 (Rigidity from infinitely many exact monomial evaluations). Let u ∈ U(Z[q]^N). If there exist i ∈ Z and an infinite set Z of roots of unity containing infinitely many of prime-power order such that u(ζ) = ± ζ^i for all ζ ∈ Z, then u = ± q^i.
Proof. Consider w = (±)q^{−i}u ∈ Z[q]^N. Then w(ζ) = 1 for all ζ ∈ Z. By Theorem 2 (injectivity of τ^Z_{N,Z} when Z contains infinitely many prime powers), w = 1.

Proposition 5 (Laurent-polynomial units are monomials). If g ∈ Z[q,q^{−1}] is a unit in Z[q]^N, then g = ± q^i.
Proof. Suppose g is not of the form ± q^i. Write h(q) = q^t g(q) ∈ Z[q] with t minimal so that h is a polynomial with at least two nonzero terms. Since q is a unit in Z[q]^N (Proposition 6 in the paper), h is a unit in Z[q]^N as well. If h(1) ∉ {±1} or h(−1) ∉ {±1}, then by Lemma 1, the image of h in Z (resp. Z via q ↦ −1) is a nonunit, contradiction. Thus assume h(1), h(−1) ∈ {±1}. Choose a prime r such that r ∤ h(0). For large r, |h(r)| > 1, and since r ∤ h(0), we have r ∤ h(r) (indeed h(r) ≡ h(0) mod r). Let p be any prime divisor of h(r); then p ≠ r, so α := r mod p ∈ F_p^× is a nonzero root of h over F_p, i.e., h(α) ≡ 0 (mod p). Let n = ord_{F_p^×}(α). Then α is a primitive n-th root of unity in F_p, hence α is a root of Φ_n modulo p. Therefore gcd(h mod p, Φ_n mod p) ≠ 1, so the image of h in F_p[q]/(Φ_n) is 0, hence not a unit. Since Z[q]/(Φ_n) → F_p[q]/(Φ_n) is a ring homomorphism, the image of h in Z[q]/(Φ_n) is not a unit. But units in Z[q]^N map to units in every Z[q]/(f) in the projective system, contradiction. Hence g = ± q^i.

Corollary 6 (Alternating sums are not units). For odd m ≥ 3, γ_m(q) = ∑_{i=0}^{m−1} (−1)^i q^i ∉ U(Z[q]^N).
Proof 1 (short). Evaluate at ζ = −1 (order 2): γ_m(−1) = ∑ (−1)^i (−1)^i = m ≠ ±1, contradicting Lemma 1.
Proof 2 (alternative). If p | m is odd and ζ is a primitive p-th root, then γ_m(ζ) = (1+ζ^m)/(1+ζ) = 2/(1+ζ), and 1+ζ is a cyclotomic unit in Z[ζ] while 2 is not a unit, so γ_m(ζ) is not a unit.

Examples
- Two-term Laurent polynomials: g(q) = a q^r + b q^s with |a|+|b| ≥ 2 are excluded by Lemma 1 unless g is ±q^k. E.g., 2−q: g(1)=1 but g(−1)=3.
- γ_3(q) = 1 − q + q^2: γ_3(−1)=3, so non-unit.

Obstacles
- The main conjecture reduces to showing that if u ∈ U(Z[q]^N) then either (i) u ∈ Z[q,q^{−1}] (now fully resolved) or (ii) one can produce infinitely many prime-power roots of unity ζ with u(ζ) = ± ζ^i for a fixed i. Our current p-adic congruences (Lemma 3) give u(ζ_{p^a}) ≡ u(1) (mod p) but do not force exact equalities for infinitely many a.
- A promising analytic route is via Strassman’s theorem: embed Z[q]^N ↪ Z_p[[q−1]] (Theorem 13). If v(q) = (±)q^{−i}u(q) satisfies v(1)=1 and v(ζ_{p^a})=1 for infinitely many a, then v=1. The bottleneck is upgrading congruences v(ζ_{p^a}) ≡ 1 (mod p) to exact equalities at infinitely many levels.

Next steps
- Formalize a p-adic analytic criterion: prove that for v ∈ 1 + (q−1)Z_p[[q−1]] arising from Z[q]^N, the valuations v_p(v(ζ_{p^a})−1) grow with a. If one can find a fixed K with v(ζ_{p^a}) ≡ 1 (mod p^K) for infinitely many a, Hensel/Strassman may yield v ≡ 1 on μ_{p^∞}.
- Two-prime synthesis: for two odd primes p, q, normalize v as above and attempt to extract the same exponent i from both towers using local expansions, then invoke Proposition 4.
- Explore resultant bounds: for general u, study Res(u_N, Φ_ℓ) for approximants u_N and large primes ℓ to force infinitely many exact monomial evaluations.

Summary
- Proven: torsion units are ±1; necessary evaluation constraints u(±1)=±1; p-adic congruence on μ_{p^∞}; rigidity from infinitely many exact monomial evaluations; and a complete Laurent-polynomial classification: Z[q,q^{−1}] ∩ U(Z[q]^N) = {±q^i}. As a corollary, the alternating sums γ_m (odd m ≥ 3) are not units. The remaining challenge is to promote p-adic congruences to infinitely many exact equalities along a prime-power tower, for which a Strassman/Hensel strategy is proposed.
