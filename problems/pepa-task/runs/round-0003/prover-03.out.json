We add three rigorous, testable results: (P1) Laurent-polynomial units are monomials; (P5) a determinant/product identity for values at n-th roots; (P6) a rigidity lemma via vanishing at infinitely many cyclotomic factors. We also record a useful p-adic valuation identity (L2) to support future \u201ctower\u201d analyses.\n\nProposition P1 (Laurent-polynomial units are monomials)\nStatement. If g \u2208 \u2124[q,q^{-1}] is a unit in the Habiro ring \u2124[q]^\u2115, then g=\u00b1q^i for some i\u2208\u2124.\nProof. Write g=q^i h with i\u2208\u2124 and h\u2208\u2124[q] chosen so h(0)\u22600. Pick a prime p\u2224h(0). Over \ud835\udd3d_p, the reduction \u0125\u2208\ud835\udd3d_p[q] is a nonconstant polynomial with nonzero constant term, hence has a nonzero root \u03b1 in some \ud835\udd3d_{p^f}. Let n=ord(\u03b1) in \ud835\udd3d_{p^f}^\u00d7. Then \u03b1 is a root of \u03a6_n modulo p, so there is a ring map \u03b8: \u2124[q]/(\u03a6_n)\u2192\ud835\udd3d_{p^f}, q\u21a6\u03b1. Since \u0125(\u03b1)=0, \u03b8(h)=0 and \u03b8(g)=\u03b8(q^i)\u03b8(h)=0. Thus g is not a unit in \u2124[q]/(\u03a6_n). By the inverse limit unit criterion (if x maps to a unit in every finite quotient then x is a unit), g cannot be a unit in \u2124[q]^\u2115. Hence h=\u00b11 and g=\u00b1q^i. \u220e\nCorollary. For odd m\u22653, \u03b3_m(q)=\u2211_{j=0}^{m\u22121}(\u22121)^j q^j is not a unit in \u2124[q]^\u2115.\n\nProposition P5 (Determinant/product identity)\nStatement. If u \u2208 U(\u2124[q]^\u2115), then for every n\u22651 we have \u220f_{\u03b6^n=1} u(\u03b6)=\u00b11.\nProof. The image \u016b of u in R_n:=\u2124[q]/(q^n\u22121) is a unit, hence multiplication-by-\u016b is an automorphism of the free abelian group R_n, with determinant \u00b11. Over \u2102, \u2102\u2297R_n\u2245\u2295_{\u03b6^n=1}\u2102 via evaluation at \u03b6, and the eigenvalues of multiplication by \u016b are u(\u03b6). Thus det=\u220f_{\u03b6^n=1}u(\u03b6)=\u00b11. \u220e\nRemark. For n=\u2113 prime, this recovers u(1)\u00b7N_{\u211a(\u03b6_\u2113)/\u211a}(u(\u03b6_\u2113))=\u00b11. As N of a unit is \u00b11, this gives no extra restriction alone, but P5 is a convenient global constraint for subsequent arguments.\n\nProposition P6 (Rigidity from infinitely many cyclotomic congruences)\nStatement. Let u \u2208 U(\u2124[q]^\u2115). If there exists an infinite set T\u2282\u2115 containing infinitely many prime powers such that u\u22611 mod \u03a6_n(q) in \u2124[q]/(\u03a6_n) for all n\u2208T, then u=1 in \u2124[q]^\u2115. More generally, if u\u2261\u00b1q^i mod \u03a6_n for all n in such T with the same sign and i, then u=\u00b1q^i.\nProof. Let Z be the set of primitive roots of unity of orders in T. By Theorem (paper\u2019s thm:2), \u03c4^\u2124_{\u2115,Z} is injective. The hypothesis u\u22611 mod \u03a6_n for all n\u2208T says u(\u03b6)=1 for all \u03b6\u2208Z, hence \u03c4(u)=1 and u=1. The \u00b1q^i variant is identical after dividing by \u00b1q^i. \u220e\n\nLemma L2 (p-adic valuation at p-power roots)\nStatement. Let p be an odd prime, a\u22651, and \u03b6 a primitive p^a-th root. Then for any integer 1\u2264k<p^a, v_{\ud835\udd2d}(1\u2212\u03b6^k)=v_{\ud835\udd2d}(1\u2212\u03b6)+v_p(k), where v_{\ud835\udd2d} is the normalized valuation on \u211a_p(\u03b6) with v_{\ud835\udd2d}(p)=1.\nSketch. In \u211a_p(\u03b6), 1\u2212\u03b6 is a uniformizer and the cyclotomic extension is totally ramified of degree \u03c6(p^a)=p^{a\u22121}(p\u22121). Using the identity \u03b6^k\u22121=(\u03b6\u22121)(1+\u03b6+\u22ef+\u03b6^{k\u22121}), one checks v_{\ud835\udd2d}(1+\u22ef+\u03b6^{k\u22121})=v_p(k) (this is standard; e.g., via the p-adic logarithm or Kummer\u2019s congruences). \u220e\nWhy useful. Evaluating (q)_n(\u03b6)=\u220f_{r=1}^n(1\u2212\u03b6^r) gives v_{\ud835\udd2d}((q)_n(\u03b6))=n\u00b7v_{\ud835\udd2d}(1\u2212\u03b6)+\u2211_{r=1}^n v_p(r)=n\u00b7v_{\ud835\udd2d}(1\u2212\u03b6)+v_p(n!). This underlies attempts to control u(\u03b6) modulo high powers of the prime above p.\n\nExamples\n- \u03b3_m non-unit (odd m): immediate from P1. This addresses and closes a previously noted caveat.\n- If u \u2208 U(\u2124[q]^\u2115) and u(\u03b6)=1 for all primitive \u03b6 of orders in an infinite set of prime powers (e.g., some fixed p^a varying a), then u=1 by P6.\n\nObstacles\n- Upgrading p-adic congruences u(\u03b6_{p^a})\u2261u(1) mod (1\u2212\u03b6_{p^a}) to exact equalities for infinitely many a is nontrivial; L2 shows valuations of (q)_n(\u03b6_{p^a}) depend on a in a delicate way, and simple \u201cincreasing congruence depth\u201d does not follow uniformly.\n- The determinant identity P5 alone does not force u(\u03b6_\u2113) to be a root of unity; extra global input is needed to pin down the principal-unit parts at infinitely many \u2113.\n\nNext steps\n- Combine L2 with explicit Habiro expansions u=\u2211_{n\u22650} a_n (q)_n to bound u(\u03b6_{p^a}) modulo (1\u2212\u03b6_{p^a})^M uniformly in a for suitable M depending on the first coefficients; investigate whether for some M the principal-unit part must vanish for infinitely many a.\n- Seek conditions guaranteeing u\u2261\u00b1q^i mod \u03a6_\u2113 for infinitely many primes \u2113; even a weaker statement (for infinitely many \u2113 in some arithmetic progression) would imply the conjecture via P6.\n- Formalize P1, P5, P6 (and L2 with references) into proofs.md; they are independent, checkable contributions toward Conjecture 7.2.\n"
