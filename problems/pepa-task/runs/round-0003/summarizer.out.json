  "summary_md": "Round focus: Conjecture 7.2 (units of the Habiro ring Z[q]^N are exactly \u00b1q^i). Proven/established this round: torsion units are \u00b11; p-adic congruences along \u03bc_{p^\u221e}; a corrected rigidity lemma that u(\u03b6)=\u00b1\u03b6^i at infinitely many prime-power \u03b6 forces u=\u00b1q^i (uses \u03c4 injectivity over that infinite set). New milestone: Laurent-polynomial units resolved \u2014 any g\u2208Z[q,q^{-1}] that is a unit in Z[q]^N equals \u00b1q^i (finite-field reduction); consequently alternating sums \u03b3_m (odd m\u22653) are not units. Additional tools: p-adic valuation lemmas and a uniform truncation lemma on \u03bc_{p^\u221e}, plus a determinant/product identity \u220f_{\u03b6^n=1}u(\u03b6)=\u00b11. Main remaining gap: promote p-adic congruences to infinitely many exact equalities u(\u03b6_{p^a})=\u00b1\u03b6_{p^a}^i. Citations: proofs.md; papers/paper1.tex",
