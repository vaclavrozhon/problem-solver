Round 2: Work remains blocked because the verbatim statement of Conjecture 7.2 and its dependent definitions/notation were not provided. The team reiterated a concrete RFI list (exact conjecture text, definitions, context, known cases, and computational constraints) and gave a readiness plan: formalize the conjecture, run edge-case sanity checks, implement a counterexample-search template, map structural/proof techniques, and enforce documentation discipline. A division of labor (Prover A/B/C) and a risk register (ambiguous quantifiers, hidden assumptions, computational intractability) were proposed. Immediate next step: supply the missing statement and supporting material so the outlined workflow can proceed.
