Round focus: Conjecture 7.2 (units of the Habiro ring Z[q]^N are exactly ±q^i). Proven/established this round: torsion units are ±1; p-adic congruences along μ_{p^∞}; a corrected rigidity lemma that u(ζ)=±ζ^i at infinitely many prime-power ζ forces u=±q^i (uses τ injectivity over that infinite set). New milestone: Laurent-polynomial units resolved — any g∈Z[q,q^{-1}] that is a unit in Z[q]^N equals ±q^i (finite-field reduction); consequently alternating sums γ_m (odd m≥3) are not units. Additional tools: p-adic valuation lemmas and a uniform truncation lemma on μ_{p^∞}, plus a determinant/product identity ∏_{ζ^n=1}u(ζ)=±1. Main remaining gap: promote p-adic congruences to infinitely many exact equalities u(ζ_{p^a})=±ζ_{p^a}^i. Citations: proofs.md; papers/paper1.tex
