  "summary_md": "Round 2: Work remains blocked because the verbatim statement of Conjecture 7.2 and its dependent definitions/notation were not provided. The team reiterated a concrete RFI list (exact conjecture text, definitions, context, known cases, and computational constraints) and gave a readiness plan: formalize the conjecture, run edge-case sanity checks, implement a counterexample-search template, map structural/proof techniques, and enforce documentation discipline. A division of labor (Prover A/B/C) and a risk register (ambiguous quantifiers, hidden assumptions, computational intractability) were proposed. Immediate next step: supply the missing statement and supporting material so the outlined workflow can proceed.",
  "highlights": [
    "Blocked: No actionable work possible because Conjecture 7.2’s exact statement and required definitions are missing.",
    "Requested RFI: verbatim conjecture (with quantifiers/domains), all dependent definitions/notation, subject-area context, known special cases/partial results, and computational constraints.",
    "Readiness plan: formalize the conjecture, run edge-case sanity checks, design a counterexample-search harness, identify structural reductions, and map applicable proof techniques.",
    "Division of labor proposed: Prover A (formalization), Prover B (enumeration/testing), Prover C (literature scan); enforce proofs.md for verified results and output.md for milestones.",
    "Risk register: ambiguous quantifiers/hidden assumptions, dependence on unstated regularity/positivity, and potential computational intractability without pruning.",
    "Citations: 'Round 1 — Setup and Missing Information' and 'Round 2 — Coordination While Awaiting the Statement' (provided round files)."

  "next_questions": [
    "Please provide the verbatim text of Conjecture 7.2, including all hypotheses, quantifiers, and variable domains, plus any earlier definitions/notation it depends on.",
    "Please supply subject-area context and any known special cases, partial results, or computational evidence related to 7.2.",
    "Please state computational constraints and allowed tooling (time/instance limits, preferred languages/packages) for automated counterexample searches."
