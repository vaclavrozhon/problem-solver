We verified and added rigorous results: (i) Laurent-polynomial units in the Habiro ring are exactly ±q^i (finite-field reduction proof); (ii) torsion units are ±1; (iii) p-adic congruence u(ζ_{p^a})≡u(1) mod p for odd p; (iv) rigidity: infinitely many exact monomial evaluations imply u=±q^i. We also added p-adic valuation lemmas for ζ^k−1 and (ζ)_n and a uniform truncation lemma across μ_{p^∞}. The main gap remains: upgrading congruences to infinitely many exact equalities along a p-power tower. Verdict: uncertain.
