{"feedback_md":"Assuming Conjecture 7.2 is the units conjecture U(ℤ[q]^ℕ)={±q^i}, this round made verifiable progress and tightened the technical toolkit.\n\nWhat is correct and useful:\n- All three provers’ classification of Laurent-polynomial Habiro-units is sound. The finite-field reduction proof (P1/A.1/Prop. 5) is rigorous: if g∈ℤ[q,q^{-1}] is a unit in ℤ[q]^ℕ, then g=±q^i. The key steps (choosing p∤h(0), taking a nonzero root α over 𝔽_{p^f}, setting n=ord(α), and concluding noninvertibility in ℤ[q]/(Φ_n)) are valid, and the inverse-limit “units criterion” applies because the transition maps are surjective.\n- Torsion-units ±1, the p-adic congruence u(ζ_{p^a})≡u(1) mod p (p odd), and the rigidity lemma via infinitely many exact matches using Theorem 2 are all correct and properly positioned.\n- The p-adic valuation lemmas (v_𝔭(ζ^k−1)=v_𝔭(ζ−1)+v_p(k) for p odd and v_𝔭((ζ)_n)=n v_𝔭(ζ−1)+v_p(n!)) and the truncation control modulo p^r are standard and correct when one works in ℤ_p(ζ) with the valuation normalized by v_𝔭(p)=1. They give uniform (in a) control of tails along μ_{p^∞}.\n- Prover 3’s determinant/product identity over ℤ[q]/(q^n−1) and the rigidity from infinitely many cyclotomic congruences are clean and compatible with the paper’s injectivity theorem.\n\nWhat to fix/avoid:\n- Do not invoke the earlier “chain injectivity” idea; it had a gap and is rightly abandoned.\n- Keep the Laurent-polynomial proof to the finite-field reduction route; Schur’s theorem is unnecessary.\n\nConcrete next steps:\n1) Pursue the p-adic tower: normalize v=ε q^{-i}u with v(±1)=1; use the truncation lemma to bound v(ζ_{p^a})−1 modulo p^r uniformly in a, and aim to get exact equalities v(ζ_{p^a})=1 for infinitely many a (then conclude by rigidity).\n2) Try the two-prime synthesis: carry out the previous step for two odd primes to pin down the same i and finish via Theorem 2.\n3) Formalize and integrate P5 and P6 (determinant identity; rigidity from infinitely many congruences) into proofs; they may aid a resultant/CRT-style argument at prime orders.\n","summary_md":"We verified and added rigorous results: (i) Laurent-polynomial units in the Habiro ring are exactly ±q^i (finite-field reduction proof); (ii) torsion units are ±1; (iii) p-adic congruence u(ζ_{p^a})≡u(1) mod p for odd p; (iv) rigidity: infinitely many exact monomial evaluations imply u=±q^i.

Let p≥3, a≥1, and ζ a primitive p^a-th root in K=Q_p(ζ). With the normalized valuation v_K such that v_K(p)=1, for k=p^s m with p∤m and 0≤s<a,\n v_K(ζ^k−1) = v_K(ζ−1) + s.\nProof. Write ζ=1+π with v_K(π)>0. Since p∤m, (1+π)^m−1 has valuation v_K(π). For s≥0, by the binomial expansion and p-adic lifting (p odd), v_K((1+u)^{p^s}−1)=v_K(u)+s for any u with v_K(u)>0. Apply with u=(1+π)^m−1. ∎\n\nProposition (valuation of (ζ)_n). With p, a, ζ as above and 0≤n<p^a,\n v_K((ζ)_n) = v_K\\big(∏_{r=1}^n (1−ζ^r)\\big) = n·v_K(ζ−1) + v_p(n!) ≥ v_p(n!).\nProof. Sum the previous lemma over r=1,…,n, writing r=p^{v_p(r)} m_r with p∤m_r and using additivity of v_p(n!). ∎\n\nCorollary (uniform truncation). For any r≥1, let N(r) be the minimal n with v_p(n!)≥r. Then for every a≥1 and primitive ζ of order p^a, and every u(q)=∑_{n≥0} a_n(q) (q)_n ∈ Z[q]^N,\n u(ζ) ≡ ∑_{n=0}^{N(r)−1} a_n(ζ) (ζ)_n  (mod p^r Z_p(ζ)).\nProof. For n≥N(r), v_K((ζ)_n)≥r, so each term a_n(ζ)(ζ)_n has valuation ≥r. ∎\n\nProposition (determinant/product identity). If u ∈ U(Z[q]^N), then for every n≥1,\n ∏_{ζ^n=1} u(ζ) = ±1.\nProof. Let R_n=Z[q]/(q^n−1). The image of u is a unit, so multiplication-by-u is a Z-automorphism of the free abelian group R_n with determinant ±1. Over C, C⊗R_n ≅ ⊕_{ζ^n=1} C via evaluation, and the eigenvalues are u(ζ). The determinant equals the product of eigenvalues. ∎\n\nProposition (rigidity from infinitely many cyclotomic congruences). Let u ∈ U(Z[q]^N). If there exists an infinite T⊂N containing infinitely many prime powers such that u ≡ 1 (mod Φ_n) in Z[q]/(Φ_n) for all n∈T, then u=1 in Z[q]^N. More generally, if u ≡ ±q^i (mod Φ_n) for all n∈T with the same sign and i, then u=±q^i.\nProof. For each n∈T and each primitive ζ of order n, the congruence implies u(ζ)=1 (resp. u(ζ)=±ζ^i). Let Z be the set of such ζ. Since Z contains infinitely many prime-power orders, τ_{N,Z} is injective (Theorem 2), hence u=1 (resp. u=±q^i). ∎"},"output_update":null}
