  "feedback_md": "We still lack the verbatim statement of Conjecture 7.2 and all dependent definitions/notation, so no mathematical progress is possible yet. There are no prover outputs to audit, hence no specific steps to critique or validate. Attempting proof/disproof without the exact statement risks pursuing the wrong target and polluting proofs.md with unusable material.\n\nConcrete, immediate next steps:\n- Provide the exact text of Conjecture 7.2, including all hypotheses, quantifiers, domains, and references to earlier definitions/lemmas. Paste any prerequisite definitions directly to avoid ambiguity.\n- If the conjecture appears in a larger document, include the surrounding paragraph(s) to capture hidden assumptions and notation.\n- List any known special cases or related statements (e.g., “7.2 generalizes Lemma 5.4” or “equivalent to Conjecture A under X”).\n\nProcess once the statement arrives:\n1) Formalize: Rewrite the conjecture in precise, self-contained form. Identify parameters, edge cases, and any monotonicity/closure properties. Extract immediate necessary conditions.\n2) Small-case tests: Design a finite search for minimal instances that could yield counterexamples (define instance space, constraints, and a checker). Establish logging format to record both satisfying and violating cases.\n3) Structural decompositions: Attempt reductions to canonical/normalized forms; check whether induction, extremal principles, or convexity tools might apply. Identify candidate lemmas whose proofs would imply the conjecture for broad classes.\n4) Documentation discipline: Keep exploratory reasoning in notes.md only. Move rigorously verified lemmas into proofs.md with full details. Update output.md only for decisive results (proof, counterexample, or sharp bounds).\n\nSuggested division of labor for provers (once statement is known): (A) formalization and immediate corollaries; (B) computational counterexample search for small parameters; (C) survey of standard theorems/techniques likely relevant.\n\nUntil the statement is supplied, further mathematical work would be speculative.",

Record any immediate necessary conditions.\n- Counterexample search template: define instance generator; property checker; logging schema (instance, parameters, pass/fail, witness); stopping rules for small cases.\n- Structural toolkit mapping: identify candidate techniques (e.g., compactness, extremal arguments, spectral/convex tools) aligned with the conjecture’s domain.\n\nDivision of labor proposal:\n- Prover A: formalization + immediate corollaries/normal forms.\n- Prover B: implement small-instance enumeration/testing and report minimal counterexamples if found.\n- Prover C: literature scan for related theorems/lemmas to reuse and potential equivalences.\n\nDocumentation discipline:\n- Only exploratory ideas here in notes.md.\n- Fully verified lemmas/proofs go to proofs.md with complete details.\n- output.md updated only for decisive milestones (proof, disproof, or sharp bounds).\n\nBlocking risks:\n- Ambiguous quantifiers or hidden assumptions.\n- Heavy dependence on earlier definitions not restated.\n- Computational intractability without problem-specific pruning.\n"
