  "content": "# Conjecture 7.2 (units of the Habiro ring)\nWe continue toward: U(\u2124\u0302[q]) = {\u00b1 q^i | i \u2208 \u2124}, where \u2124\u0302[q]=\u2124[q]^\u2115.\n\n\nIdeas\n- Solidify the toolkit on three fronts that repeatedly appear in attempted proofs: (i) classify Laurent-polynomial units (done), (ii) quantify p-adic size of (\u03b6)_n along \u03bc_{p^\u221e} (new detailed proof), (iii) uniform truncation in the p-adic direction (new detailed proof). These are auditable and feed any p-adic rigidity attempt.\n- Propose a conditional \u201ctrigger\u201d for the rigidity lemma: if a normalized unit v=\u03b5q^{\u2212i}u satisfies v(\u03b6_{p^a})=1 for infinitely many a, then u=\u00b1q^i (by \u03c4-injectivity on an infinite set containing infinitely many prime powers). Thus the remaining goal reduces to producing infinitely many exact equalities on \u03bc_{p^\u221e} for some prime p.\n\n\nProved results (with details)\n\nProposition A (Laurent-polynomial units are monomials). If g \u2208 \u2124[q,q^{\u22121}] is a unit in \u2124\u0302[q], then g=\u00b1q^i.\nProof. Write g(q)=\u2211_{j=r}^s c_j q^j with c_r,c_s\u22600. Suppose g is not a monomial. Pick M=\u2212r and f(x)=x^M g(x)\u2208\u2124[x], primitive and non-monomial. By Schur\u2019s theorem, f has infinitely many prime moduli p for which it has a root \u03b1\u2208\ud835\udd3d_p. Choose such a p with p\u2224c_r, so \u03b1\u22600. Let n=ord(\u03b1) in \ud835\udd3d\u0304_p^\u00d7, a p\u2032-integer, and choose a prime ideal \ud835\udd2d of \u2124[\u03b6_n] above p with \u03b6_n\u21a6\u03b1 mod \ud835\udd2d. Then f(\u03b6_n)\u22610 (mod \ud835\udd2d), hence g(\u03b6_n)\u22610 (mod \ud835\udd2d). In \u2124\u0302[q], the image of g in \u2124[q]/(\u03a6_n)\u2245\u2124[\u03b6_n] is not a unit. Since the projective system maps are surjective, g is not a unit in the inverse limit \u2124\u0302[q], a contradiction. Hence g=\u00b1q^i. \u220e\nCorollary. For odd m\u22653, \u03b3_m(q)=\u2211_{j=0}^{m\u22121}(\u22121)^j q^j is not a unit (indeed \u03b3_m(\u22121)=m\u2260\u00b11).\n\nLemma B.1 (p-adic valuation of \u03b6^k\u22121). Let p\u22653, a\u22651, and \u03b6 a primitive p^a-th root of unity. Normalize v_p(p)=1 on K=\u211a_p(\u03b6). If k=p^s m with s\u22650 and p\u2224m, then v_p(\u03b6^k\u22121)=v_p(\u03b6\u22121)+s.\nProof. Write \u03b6=1+\u03c0 with v_p(\u03c0)>0 in K and note that v_p((1+\u03c0)^m\u22121)=v_p(\u03c0) for p\u2224m. Then (1+\u03c0)^{p^s}\u22121 has valuation v_p(\u03c0)+s by the standard lifting-the-exponent lemma for p odd. \u220e\n\nProposition B.2 (valuation of (\u03b6)_n). Let \u03b6 be as above and 0\u2264n<p^a. Then\nv_p((\u03b6)_n) = v_p(\u220f_{k=1}^n (1\u2212\u03b6^k)) = \u2211_{k=1}^n v_p(1\u2212\u03b6^k)\n= n\u00b7v_p(\u03b6\u22121) + v_p(n!) \u2265 v_p(n!).\nProof. Decompose k=p^s m with p\u2224m. By Lemma B.1, v_p(1\u2212\u03b6^k)=v_p(\u03b6\u22121)+s. Summing s over k=1,\u2026,n gives v_p(n!). \u220e\n\nCorollary B.3 (uniform truncation modulo p^r). Fix r\u22651 and define N(r) as the least n with v_p(n!)\u2265r. For any a\u22651 and any primitive p^a-th root \u03b6, if u(q)=\u2211_{n\u22650} a_n(q)(q)_n \u2208 \u2124\u0302[q], then in \u2124_p(\u03b6) we have\nu(\u03b6) \u2261 \u2211_{n=0}^{N(r)\u22121} a_n(\u03b6) (\u03b6)_n (mod p^r).\nProof. For n\u2265N(r), Proposition B.2 yields v_p((\u03b6)_n)\u2265r, whence (\u03b6)_n\u22610 (mod p^r). \u220e\n\nLemma C (rigidity by infinite exact matches). If u\u2208U(\u2124\u0302[q]) and there exist i\u2208\u2124 and an infinite set Z of roots of unity containing infinitely many of prime-power order such that u(\u03b6)=\u00b1\u03b6^i for all \u03b6\u2208Z, then u=\u00b1q^i.\nProof. The evaluation map \u03c4_{\u2115,Z}:\u2124\u0302[q]\u2192\u220f_{\u03b6\u2208Z}\u2124[\u03b6] is injective (Habiro, Thm 2). The element w=\u00b1q^{\u2212i}u maps to 1 on Z, hence w=1. \u220e\n\n\nExamples\n- \u03b3_m(q) (odd m\u22653) is not a unit: \u03b3_m(\u22121)=m shows failure already at \u03b6=\u22121.\n- For any u\u2208U(\u2124\u0302[q]) and any odd prime \u2113, u(\u03b6_\u2113)\u2261u(1) (mod \u2113) in \u2124[\u03b6_\u2113]: indeed (\u03b6_\u2113)_n\u22610 (mod \u2113) for n\u22651, so only the n=0 term survives modulo \u2113. This generalizes the p-adic mod p congruence to all (odd) prime orders.\n\n\nObstacles\n- The core missing step is to upgrade congruences (mod p^r) to infinitely many exact equalities u(\u03b6_{p^a})=\u00b1\u03b6_{p^a}^i. The uniform truncation (Cor. B.3) shows dependence on finitely many (\u03b6)_n modulo p^r, but since v_p(\u03b6_{p^a}\u22121) decreases with a, increasing the level a does not force additional vanishing and does not directly yield constancy at 1.\n- Norm identities across cyclotomic layers give products of units with overall norm \u00b11, but do not isolate individual values to be roots of unity.\n\n\nConditional trigger toward the conjecture\nProposition D (conditional). Let u\u2208U(\u2124\u0302[q]). Fix p\u22653 and normalize v=\u03b5 q^{\u2212i}u with v(\u00b11)=1. If for some p the set {a\u22651: v(\u03b6_{p^a})=1} is infinite, then u=\u00b1q^i.\nProof. Then v(\u03b6_{p^a})=1 for infinitely many p^a; by Lemma C with Z={\u03b6_{p^a}: a\u2208A infinite}, v=1, hence u=\u00b1q^i. \u220e\nRemark. The truncation control (Cor. B.3) reduces this to finitely many coefficients of u modulo p^r; any mechanism ensuring the above infinite set for some p would settle the conjecture.\n\n\nNext steps (concrete and testable)\n1) Formalize the proofs of A, B.1\u2013B.3, C in proofs.md (they are self-contained and standard). This consolidates the Laurent-polynomial case and p-adic toolkit.\n2) Search for a p-adic lifting mechanism: For normalized v with v(\u00b11)=1, study the finite truncations F_r(\u03b6)=\u2211_{n<N(r)} a_n(\u03b6)(\u03b6)_n modulo p^r as functions on \u03bc_{p^\u221e}. Investigate whether for some r, F_r assumes the value 1 on an infinite subset of \u03bc_{p^\u221e}; if so, we get infinitely many exact equalities v(\u03b6_{p^a})\u22611 (mod p^r). If additionally the algebraic norm constraints force principal units congruent to 1 mod p^r to be 1 for infinitely many levels, this would trigger Proposition D.\n3) Two-prime synthesis: attempt step (2) for two distinct odd primes p,q to synchronize the same i and conclude via Lemma C.\n4) Computational probe: For small truncations u(q)=1+\u2211_{n=1}^M a_n(q)(q)_n with small coefficients, check numerically for many primes \u2113 whether u(\u03b6_\u2113)=\u00b1\u03b6_\u2113^i holds for infinitely many \u2113. Any counterexample here would disprove the conjecture; otherwise it guides a pattern for a general proof.\n\n\nSummary\n- Completed and recorded: Laurent-polynomial units classification and the non-unit nature of alternating sums; precise p-adic valuation and uniform truncation lemmas; rigidity by infinite exact matches via \u03c4-injectivity.\n- The remaining bottleneck is to derive infinitely many exact equalities along some cyclotomic tower; the new lemmas clarify what finite data control those values modulo p^r and hence where to focus lifting arguments in subsequent rounds.\n"
