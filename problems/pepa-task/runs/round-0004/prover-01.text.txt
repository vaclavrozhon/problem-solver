# Conjecture 7.2 (units of the Habiro ring)
We continue toward: U(ℤ̂[q]) = {± q^i | i ∈ ℤ}, where ℤ̂[q]=ℤ[q]^ℕ.


Ideas
- Solidify the toolkit on three fronts that repeatedly appear in attempted proofs: (i) classify Laurent-polynomial units (done), (ii) quantify p-adic size of (ζ)_n along μ_{p^∞} (new detailed proof), (iii) uniform truncation in the p-adic direction (new detailed proof). These are auditable and feed any p-adic rigidity attempt.
- Propose a conditional “trigger” for the rigidity lemma: if a normalized unit v=εq^{−i}u satisfies v(ζ_{p^a})=1 for infinitely many a, then u=±q^i (by τ-injectivity on an infinite set containing infinitely many prime powers). Thus the remaining goal reduces to producing infinitely many exact equalities on μ_{p^∞} for some prime p.


Proved results (with details)

Proposition A (Laurent-polynomial units are monomials). If g ∈ ℤ[q,q^{−1}] is a unit in ℤ̂[q], then g=±q^i.
Proof. Write g(q)=∑_{j=r}^s c_j q^j with c_r,c_s≠0. Suppose g is not a monomial. Pick M=−r and f(x)=x^M g(x)∈ℤ[x], primitive and non-monomial. By Schur’s theorem, f has infinitely many prime moduli p for which it has a root α∈𝔽_p. Choose such a p with p∤c_r, so α≠0. Let n=ord(α) in 𝔽̄_p^×, a p′-integer, and choose a prime ideal 𝔭 of ℤ[ζ_n] above p with ζ_n↦α mod 𝔭. Then f(ζ_n)≡0 (mod 𝔭), hence g(ζ_n)≡0 (mod 𝔭). In ℤ̂[q], the image of g in ℤ[q]/(Φ_n)≅ℤ[ζ_n] is not a unit. Since the projective system maps are surjective, g is not a unit in the inverse limit ℤ̂[q], a contradiction. Hence g=±q^i. ∎
Corollary. For odd m≥3, γ_m(q)=∑_{j=0}^{m−1}(−1)^j q^j is not a unit (indeed γ_m(−1)=m≠±1).

Lemma B.1 (p-adic valuation of ζ^k−1). Let p≥3, a≥1, and ζ a primitive p^a-th root of unity. Normalize v_p(p)=1 on K=ℚ_p(ζ). If k=p^s m with s≥0 and p∤m, then v_p(ζ^k−1)=v_p(ζ−1)+s.
Proof. Write ζ=1+π with v_p(π)>0 in K and note that v_p((1+π)^m−1)=v_p(π) for p∤m. Then (1+π)^{p^s}−1 has valuation v_p(π)+s by the standard lifting-the-exponent lemma for p odd. ∎

Proposition B.2 (valuation of (ζ)_n). Let ζ be as above and 0≤n<p^a. Then
v_p((ζ)_n) = v_p(∏_{k=1}^n (1−ζ^k)) = ∑_{k=1}^n v_p(1−ζ^k)
= n·v_p(ζ−1) + v_p(n!) ≥ v_p(n!).
Proof. Decompose k=p^s m with p∤m. By Lemma B.1, v_p(1−ζ^k)=v_p(ζ−1)+s. Summing s over k=1,…,n gives v_p(n!). ∎

Corollary B.3 (uniform truncation modulo p^r). Fix r≥1 and define N(r) as the least n with v_p(n!)≥r. For any a≥1 and any primitive p^a-th root ζ, if u(q)=∑_{n≥0} a_n(q)(q)_n ∈ ℤ̂[q], then in ℤ_p(ζ) we have
u(ζ) ≡ ∑_{n=0}^{N(r)−1} a_n(ζ) (ζ)_n (mod p^r).
Proof. For n≥N(r), Proposition B.2 yields v_p((ζ)_n)≥r, whence (ζ)_n≡0 (mod p^r). ∎

Lemma C (rigidity by infinite exact matches). If u∈U(ℤ̂[q]) and there exist i∈ℤ and an infinite set Z of roots of unity containing infinitely many of prime-power order such that u(ζ)=±ζ^i for all ζ∈Z, then u=±q^i.
Proof. The evaluation map τ_{ℕ,Z}:ℤ̂[q]→∏_{ζ∈Z}ℤ[ζ] is injective (Habiro, Thm 2). The element w=±q^{−i}u maps to 1 on Z, hence w=1. ∎


Examples
- γ_m(q) (odd m≥3) is not a unit: γ_m(−1)=m shows failure already at ζ=−1.
- For any u∈U(ℤ̂[q]) and any odd prime ℓ, u(ζ_ℓ)≡u(1) (mod ℓ) in ℤ[ζ_ℓ]: indeed (ζ_ℓ)_n≡0 (mod ℓ) for n≥1, so only the n=0 term survives modulo ℓ. This generalizes the p-adic mod p congruence to all (odd) prime orders.


Obstacles
- The core missing step is to upgrade congruences (mod p^r) to infinitely many exact equalities u(ζ_{p^a})=±ζ_{p^a}^i. The uniform truncation (Cor. B.3) shows dependence on finitely many (ζ)_n modulo p^r, but since v_p(ζ_{p^a}−1) decreases with a, increasing the level a does not force additional vanishing and does not directly yield constancy at 1.
- Norm identities across cyclotomic layers give products of units with overall norm ±1, but do not isolate individual values to be roots of unity.


Conditional trigger toward the conjecture
Proposition D (conditional). Let u∈U(ℤ̂[q]). Fix p≥3 and normalize v=ε q^{−i}u with v(±1)=1. If for some p the set {a≥1: v(ζ_{p^a})=1} is infinite, then u=±q^i.
Proof. Then v(ζ_{p^a})=1 for infinitely many p^a; by Lemma C with Z={ζ_{p^a}: a∈A infinite}, v=1, hence u=±q^i. ∎
Remark. The truncation control (Cor. B.3) reduces this to finitely many coefficients of u modulo p^r; any mechanism ensuring the above infinite set for some p would settle the conjecture.


Next steps (concrete and testable)
1) Formalize the proofs of A, B.1–B.3, C in proofs.md (they are self-contained and standard). This consolidates the Laurent-polynomial case and p-adic toolkit.
2) Search for a p-adic lifting mechanism: For normalized v with v(±1)=1, study the finite truncations F_r(ζ)=∑_{n<N(r)} a_n(ζ)(ζ)_n modulo p^r as functions on μ_{p^∞}. Investigate whether for some r, F_r assumes the value 1 on an infinite subset of μ_{p^∞}; if so, we get infinitely many exact equalities v(ζ_{p^a})≡1 (mod p^r). If additionally the algebraic norm constraints force principal units congruent to 1 mod p^r to be 1 for infinitely many levels, this would trigger Proposition D.
3) Two-prime synthesis: attempt step (2) for two distinct odd primes p,q to synchronize the same i and conclude via Lemma C.
4) Computational probe: For small truncations u(q)=1+∑_{n=1}^M a_n(q)(q)_n with small coefficients, check numerically for many primes ℓ whether u(ζ_ℓ)=±ζ_ℓ^i holds for infinitely many ℓ. Any counterexample here would disprove the conjecture; otherwise it guides a pattern for a general proof.


Summary
- Completed and recorded: Laurent-polynomial units classification and the non-unit nature of alternating sums; precise p-adic valuation and uniform truncation lemmas; rigidity by infinite exact matches via τ-injectivity.
- The remaining bottleneck is to derive infinitely many exact equalities along some cyclotomic tower; the new lemmas clarify what finite data control those values modulo p^r and hence where to focus lifting arguments in subsequent rounds.
