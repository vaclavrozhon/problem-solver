  "content": "Scope. We work under Conjecture 7.2: U(\u2124[q]^\u2115) = {\u00b1q^i | i \u2208 \u2124}. I record rigorously proven pieces, a correction to a claim in the notes, and a couple of new constraints that sharpen the search for a proof.\n\nIdeas\n- Solidify and formalize the Laurent-polynomial case: if g \u2208 \u2124[q,q^{-1}] is a Habiro-unit, then g = \u00b1q^i. This eliminates a large class of potential counterexamples and yields \u03b3_m non-units immediately.\n- Record a \u201cdeterminant (resultant) identity\u201d for units modulo q^n\u22121: \u220f_{\u03b6^n=1} u(\u03b6) = \u00b11. This gives global algebraic constraints on the values u(\u03b6).\n- Correct a subtlety in the p-adic \u201cuniform truncation\u201d claim: while (q)_n(\u03b6_{p^a})=0 for n\u2265p^a, there is no p-adic uniform-in-a lower bound on v_p((\u03b6_{p^a})_n) for fixed n. This affects strategies relying on uniform p-adic tails.\n- Reduction-of-goal lemma: if u(\u03b6)=\u00b1\u03b6^i for infinitely many distinct \u03b6 of prime-power order (not necessarily all primitive roots at a given level), then u=\u00b1q^i (via \u03c4-injectivity on an infinite set).\n\nRigorous proofs (to include in proofs.md)\n\nProposition A (Laurent-polynomial Habiro-units are monomials). If g \u2208 \u2124[q,q^{-1}] is a unit in \u2124[q]^\u2115, then g = \u00b1 q^i.\nProof. Choose t so that h(q) := q^t g(q) \u2208 \u2124[q] is a nonzero polynomial with at least two nonzero coefficients (otherwise g=\u00b1q^i). Since q is a unit in \u2124[q]^\u2115 (Prop. 6 of the paper), h is a unit in \u2124[q]^\u2115. If h(1) \u2209 {\u00b11} or h(\u22121) \u2209 {\u00b11}, then by evaluation (Lemma 1 below) h maps to a nonunit in \u2124 or \u2124 respectively, contradiction. Thus assume h(1), h(\u22121) \u2208 {\u00b11}. Pick a prime r with r \u2224 h(0). For large integer R, set x=R; then |h(x)|>1 and h(x) \u2261 h(0) (mod r), so r \u2224 h(x). Let p be any prime divisor of h(x). Reduce mod p: in \ud835\udd3d_p, \u03b1 := x mod p is a nonzero root of h, hence ord(\u03b1)=n divides p\u22121. Then \u03a6_n(\u03b1)\u22610, so h and \u03a6_n are not coprime modulo p. Therefore the image of h in \u2124[q]/(\u03a6_n(q)) maps to 0 in \ud835\udd3d_p[q]/(\u03a6_n), and hence is not a unit in \u2124[q]/(\u03a6_n(q)). But units in \u2124[q]^\u2115 project to units in every \u2124[q]/(f) in the defining inverse system, contradiction. Hence g=\u00b1q^i.\n\nCorollary B (Alternating sums are not units). For odd m\u22653, \u03b3_m(q):=\u2211_{i=0}^{m\u22121}(\u22121)^i q^i \u2209 U(\u2124[q]^\u2115).\nProof 1. \u03b3_m(\u22121)=m\u2260\u00b11, so \u03b3_m cannot be a unit by Lemma 1. Proof 2. Alternatively, Proposition A applies since \u03b3_m\u2209{\u00b1q^i}.\n\nLemma 1 (Evaluation preserves units). For \u03b6 a root of unity, ev_\u03b6: \u2124[q]^\u2115 \u2192 \u2124[\u03b6] is a ring homomorphism. Hence u \u2208 U(\u2124[q]^\u2115) \u21d2 u(\u03b6) \u2208 U(\u2124[\u03b6]). In particular u(\u00b11)\u2208{\u00b11}.\nProof. Evaluation is a component of \u03c4, which is a ring homomorphism; homomorphisms send units to units.\n\nLemma 2 (Torsion units are trivial). If u^m=1 in \u2124[q]^\u2115, then u=\u00b11.\nProof. Embed \u2124[q]^\u2115 \u21aa \u2124[[q\u22121]] (Theorem 13). In \u2124[[q\u22121]] write v=\u03c3(u)=c(1+a), c\u2208{\u00b11}, a\u2208(q\u22121)\u2124[[q\u22121]]. If c=1, passing to \u211a[[q\u22121]] gives 0=log(v^m)=m log v \u21d2 v=1. If c=\u22121, then (\u22121)^m(1+a)^m=1; if m odd, impossible; if m even, (1+a)^m=1 \u21d2 v=\u22121. Pull back via injectivity.\n\nProposition C (Determinant/Resultant identity). For each n\u22651 and u\u2208U(\u2124[q]^\u2115), one has\n\u220f_{\u03b6^n=1} u(\u03b6) = \u00b11.\nProof. Consider multiplication-by-u on the free \u2124-module \u2124[q]/(q^n\u22121) of rank n. The determinant is an integer and equals the product over the complex eigenvalues of this \u2124-linear map, i.e., \u220f_{\u03b6^n=1} u(\u03b6). Since u maps to a unit in \u2124[q]/(q^n\u22121), this \u2124-linear map is invertible, and its determinant is \u00b11.\n\nProposition D (Rigidity from infinitely many exact matches). If u \u2208 U(\u2124[q]^\u2115), and there exist i\u2208\u2124 and an infinite set Z of roots of unity that contains infinitely many of prime-power order such that u(\u03b6)=\u00b1\u03b6^i for all \u03b6\u2208Z, then u=\u00b1q^i.\nProof. Let w=(\u00b1)q^{\u2212i}u; then w(\u03b6)=1 for \u03b6\u2208Z. By Theorem 2 (injectivity of \u03c4 over infinite sets with infinitely many prime powers), w=1.\n\nCorrection to a claim in Notes (uniform truncation)\n- The statement \u201cfor any r\u22651 there is N(r) with v_\ud835\udd2d((\u03b6)_n)\u2265r for all n\u2265N(r), uniformly in a\u201d is false in the normalization v_\ud835\udd2d(p)=1. In \u211a_p(\u03b6_{p^a}), one has v_p(\u03b6_{p^a}\u22121)=1/((p\u22121)p^{a\u22121}); thus v_p((\u03b6_{p^a})_n)=\u2211_{k\u2264n} v_p(\u03b6_{p^a}^k\u22121)\u2248 n\u00b7v_p(\u03b6_{p^a}\u22121)+O(log n). As a increases, v_p(\u03b6_{p^a}\u22121) decreases, so no uniform (in a) lower bound can hold for fixed n. The correct and very useful truncation is exact: (\u03b6_{p^a})_n=0 for n\u2265p^a, so u(\u03b6_{p^a}) depends only on the finitely many coefficients a_0,\u2026,a_{p^a\u22121} in the Habiro expansion u=\u2211 a_n (q)_n.\n\nTwo immediate consequences (useful constraints)\n- Reduction-of-goal lemma. To prove u=\u00b1q^i, it suffices to find a fixed i and infinitely many distinct roots \u03b6 of prime-power order such that u(\u03b6)=\u00b1\u03b6^i (then apply Proposition D). Equivalently (by Theorem 17\u2019s injectivity of \u03c1^\u2124_{\u2115,S\u2032} for any nonempty S\u2032), it also suffices to find a prime p and infinitely many a with u\u2261\u00b1q^i (mod \u03a6_{p^a}).\n- Determinant constraint (Proposition C) indicates that for each n and any rational prime p, the multiset {u(\u03b6): \u03b6^n=1} cannot all lie in the maximal ideal above p in every cyclotomic component simultaneously. While not yet yielding exact matches, this rules out certain \u201ctoo p-adically small\u201d behavior across all \u03b6 of a fixed order.\n\nExamples/tests\n- Two-term Laurent polynomials. g(q)=aq^r+bq^s with |a|+|b|\u22652: Lemma 1 forces g(\u00b11)\u2208{\u00b11}, which fails unless g=\u00b1q^k.\n- Alternating sums \u03b3_m. \u03b3_m(\u22121)=m for odd m\u22653, hence non-unit; alternative: \u03b3_m(\u03b6_p)=2/(1+\u03b6_p) (non-unit) if p|m, p odd.\n\nObstacles\n- Upgrading the congruences u(\u03b6_{p^a}) \u2261 u(1) (mod p) to exact equalities u(\u03b6_{p^a})=\u00b1\u03b6_{p^a}^i for infinitely many a remains the bottleneck. As noted, uniform p-adic tail control across a is unavailable.\n- A plausible analytic path uses the embedding \u2124[q]^\u2115 \u21aa \u2124_p[[q\u22121]]. For v=(\u00b1)q^{\u2212i}u with v(1)=1, write v(q)=h(q\u22121) with h\u22081+T\u2124_p[[T]]. If one can show h(\u03b6_{p^a}\u22121)=1 for infinitely many a, then Strassman\u2019s theorem forces h\u22611 and hence u=\u00b1q^i. The missing piece is a mechanism guaranteeing infinitely many such exact equalities along the \u03bc_{p^\u221e} tower.\n\nNext steps\n- Exploit towers modulo (p,\u03a6_{p^a}). Study the projective system R_a=\u2124[q]/(\u03a6_{p^a}(q)) and the images of u therein; attempt to show stabilization u\u2261\u00b1q^i for infinitely many a (e.g., via lifting from level a to a+1 under suitable derivative/nondegeneracy conditions). A successful criterion here, even for one fixed p, would resolve the conjecture via Proposition D.\n- Strengthen determinant constraints: For fixed n, analyze the valuations of \u220f_{\u03b6^n=1} (u(\u03b6)/\u00b1\u03b6^i) using Prop. C to force many exact matches; seek a combinatorial/p-adic pigeonhole across varying n.\n- Record and formalize the above Proposition A\u2013D and the correction to uniform truncation in proofs.md; add the determinant identity as a reusable lemma.\n"
