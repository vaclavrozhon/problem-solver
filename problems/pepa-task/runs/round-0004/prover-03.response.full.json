We add two new, checkable lemmas that canonically extract an integer \u201cslope\u201d i from any unit u, and show first-order p-adic matching u(\u03b6) \u2261 u(1)\u00b7\u03b6^i modulo (\u03b6\u22121)^2 along every p-power tower. This gives a single candidate i to compare with the monomial \u00b1q^i.\\n\\nLemma 1 (Integer slope from the Ohtsuki expansion)\\nStatement. Let u\u2208U(\u2124[q]^\u2115) with Habiro expansion u(q)=\u2211_{n\u22650} a_n(q)\\bigl((q)_n\\bigr), a_n\u2208\u2124[q], and write \u03b5=u(1)\u2208{\u00b11}. Then\\n(i) u\u2032(1)/u(1)\u2208\u2124, and more precisely u\u2032(1)=a_0\u2032(1)\u2212a_1(1) and u(1)=a_0(1)=\u03b5.\\n(ii) Define i:=u\u2032(1)/u(1)\u2208\u2124.\\nProof. Evaluate at q=1. Since (q)_0=1 and (q)_n(1)=0 for n\u22651, we get u(1)=a_0(1). For derivatives, note (q)_1=1\u2212q so (q)_1\u2032(1)=\u22121, while for n\u22652 the product representation (q)_n=(1\u2212q)\u00b7\u220f_{k=2}^n(1\u2212q^k) gives (q)_n\u2032(1)=\u2212\u220f_{k=2}^n(1\u22121^k)=0. Thus u\u2032(1)=a_0\u2032(1)+(\u22121)\u00b7a_1(1). Since a_0(1)=\u00b11, division by u(1) is by \u00b11 and yields an integer. \u220e\\n\\nProposition 2 (First-order p-adic matching along \u03bc_{p^\u221e})\\nStatement. Let u\u2208U(\u2124[q]^\u2115), \u03b5=u(1), and i as in Lemma 1. Fix an odd prime p and a\u22651. For any primitive \u03b6 of order p^a, in \u2124_p(\u03b6) we have\\nu(\u03b6) \u2261 \u03b5\u00b7\u03b6^i mod (\u03b6\u22121)^2.\\nProof. View u as a power series at q=1: in \u2124_p[[X]] with X=q\u22121, u(1+X)=c_0+c_1X+X^2\u00b7w(X), where c_0=u(1)=\u03b5, c_1=u\u2032(1)=\u03b5\u00b7i, and w(X)\u2208\u2124_p[[X]]. For \u03b6 with ord(\u03b6)=p^a we have |\u03b6\u22121|_p<1, so evaluation X\u21a6\u03b6\u22121 defines a continuous homomorphism \u2124_p[[X]]\u2192\u2124_p(\u03b6). Hence u(\u03b6)\u2261\u03b5+\u03b5\u00b7i(\u03b6\u22121) mod (\u03b6\u22121)^2. On the other hand, \u03b6^i=(1+(\u03b6\u22121))^i\u22611+i(\u03b6\u22121) mod (\u03b6\u22121)^2. Multiplying by \u03b5 gives the claim. \u220e\\n\\nConsequences and consistency checks\\n- The integer i of Lemma 1 is canonical (independent of p,a), and Proposition 2 gives the same first-order congruence along every p-power tower.\\n- For the monomials u=\u00b1q^i, Lemma 1 yields i correctly, and Proposition 2 is an equality up to order (\u03b6\u22121)^2.\\n\\nPreviously established tools (for cross-reference)\\n- Laurent-polynomial units resolved: If g\u2208\u2124[q,q^{\u22121}] is a unit in \u2124[q]^\u2115, then g=\u00b1q^i. In particular, \u03b3_m(q)=\u2211_{j=0}^{m\u22121}(\u22121)^j q^j (odd m\u22653) is not a unit.\\n- Torsion units are \u00b11; p-adic congruence u(\u03b6_{p^a})\u2261u(1) mod p; product/determinant identity \u220f_{\u03b6^n=1}u(\u03b6)=\u00b11; rigidity: if u(\u03b6)=\u00b1\u03b6^i for infinitely many prime-power \u03b6, then u=\u00b1q^i (by \u03c4-injectivity over such Z).\\n\\nExamples\\n- Take u(q)=\u00b1q^i(1+(q\u22121)^2). Then Lemma 1 gives i; Proposition 2 yields u(\u03b6)\u2261\u00b1\u03b6^i mod (\u03b6\u22121)^2 for any p^a, consistent with direct evaluation.\\n\\nObstacles\\n- Proposition 2 gives only first-order matching. To apply the rigidity lemma, we need exact equalities u(\u03b6_{p^a})=\u00b1\u03b6_{p^a}^i for infinitely many a. A mechanism to upgrade the congruence modulo (\u03b6\u22121)^2 to equality at infinitely many levels is still missing.\\n- Height/archimedean approaches (e.g., Dobrowolski-type bounds) could potentially force units that are \u201ctoo close\u201d to 1 (after normalizing by \u00b1\u03b6^i) to be equal to 1 for infinitely many towers, but this requires nontrivial global input beyond the current toolkit.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- p-adic logarithm analysis: For E_{p^a}:=u(\u03b6_{p^a})/(\u03b5\u00b7\u03b6_{p^a}^i), we have E_{p^a}\u22081+(\u03b6\u22121)^2. Study log E_{p^a} in \u2124_p(\u03b6_{p^a}); aim to show v_p(log E_{p^a})\u2192\u221e as a\u2192\u221e, and seek criteria under which log E_{p^a}=0 for infinitely many a (then E_{p^a}=1 and apply rigidity).\\n- Coefficient control from Habiro expansion: express E_{p^a} explicitly via the first few coefficients of the Ohtsuki expansion, bounding its valuation uniformly in terms of a; attempt to show that for infinitely many a the principal unit must be 1.\\n- Combine two primes: Lemma 1 already fixes a global i. If one can produce exact equalities along \u03bc_{p^\u221e} for some prime p (infinitely many a), then u=\u00b1q^i by the rigidity lemma. The same plan can be attempted for two primes if needed.\\n\\nRemarks for proofs.md\\n- Include detailed proofs of Lemma 1 and Proposition 2 (they are short and self-contained), and restate the already-verified results about Laurent-polynomial units and rigidity via \u03c4-injectivity. These provide a coherent \u201cfirst-order normalization\u201d framework around the canonical exponent i. \"}",
