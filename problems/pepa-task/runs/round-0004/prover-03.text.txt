Ideas
- Target: Conjecture 7.2 (units of Habiro ring ℤ[q]^ℕ are exactly {±q^i}). We add two new, checkable lemmas that canonically extract an integer “slope” i from any unit u, and show first-order p-adic matching u(ζ) ≡ u(1)·ζ^i modulo (ζ−1)^2 along every p-power tower. This gives a single candidate i to compare with the monomial ±q^i.

Lemma 1 (Integer slope from the Ohtsuki expansion)
Statement. Let u∈U(ℤ[q]^ℕ) with Habiro expansion u(q)=∑_{n≥0} a_n(q)igl((q)_nigr), a_n∈ℤ[q], and write ε=u(1)∈{±1}. Then
(i) u′(1)/u(1)∈ℤ, and more precisely u′(1)=a_0′(1)−a_1(1) and u(1)=a_0(1)=ε.
(ii) Define i:=u′(1)/u(1)∈ℤ.
Proof. Evaluate at q=1. Since (q)_0=1 and (q)_n(1)=0 for n≥1, we get u(1)=a_0(1). For derivatives, note (q)_1=1−q so (q)_1′(1)=−1, while for n≥2 the product representation (q)_n=(1−q)·∏_{k=2}^n(1−q^k) gives (q)_n′(1)=−∏_{k=2}^n(1−1^k)=0. Thus u′(1)=a_0′(1)+(−1)·a_1(1). Since a_0(1)=±1, division by u(1) is by ±1 and yields an integer. ∎

Proposition 2 (First-order p-adic matching along μ_{p^∞})
Statement. Let u∈U(ℤ[q]^ℕ), ε=u(1), and i as in Lemma 1. Fix an odd prime p and a≥1. For any primitive ζ of order p^a, in ℤ_p(ζ) we have
u(ζ) ≡ ε·ζ^i mod (ζ−1)^2.
Proof. View u as a power series at q=1: in ℤ_p[[X]] with X=q−1, u(1+X)=c_0+c_1X+X^2·w(X), where c_0=u(1)=ε, c_1=u′(1)=ε·i, and w(X)∈ℤ_p[[X]]. For ζ with ord(ζ)=p^a we have |ζ−1|_p<1, so evaluation X↦ζ−1 defines a continuous homomorphism ℤ_p[[X]]→ℤ_p(ζ). Hence u(ζ)≡ε+ε·i(ζ−1) mod (ζ−1)^2. On the other hand, ζ^i=(1+(ζ−1))^i≡1+i(ζ−1) mod (ζ−1)^2. Multiplying by ε gives the claim. ∎

Consequences and consistency checks
- The integer i of Lemma 1 is canonical (independent of p,a), and Proposition 2 gives the same first-order congruence along every p-power tower.
- For the monomials u=±q^i, Lemma 1 yields i correctly, and Proposition 2 is an equality up to order (ζ−1)^2.

Previously established tools (for cross-reference)
- Laurent-polynomial units resolved: If g∈ℤ[q,q^{−1}] is a unit in ℤ[q]^ℕ, then g=±q^i. In particular, γ_m(q)=∑_{j=0}^{m−1}(−1)^j q^j (odd m≥3) is not a unit.
- Torsion units are ±1; p-adic congruence u(ζ_{p^a})≡u(1) mod p; product/determinant identity ∏_{ζ^n=1}u(ζ)=±1; rigidity: if u(ζ)=±ζ^i for infinitely many prime-power ζ, then u=±q^i (by τ-injectivity over such Z).

Examples
- Take u(q)=±q^i(1+(q−1)^2). Then Lemma 1 gives i; Proposition 2 yields u(ζ)≡±ζ^i mod (ζ−1)^2 for any p^a, consistent with direct evaluation.

Obstacles
- Proposition 2 gives only first-order matching. To apply the rigidity lemma, we need exact equalities u(ζ_{p^a})=±ζ_{p^a}^i for infinitely many a. A mechanism to upgrade the congruence modulo (ζ−1)^2 to equality at infinitely many levels is still missing.
- Height/archimedean approaches (e.g., Dobrowolski-type bounds) could potentially force units that are “too close” to 1 (after normalizing by ±ζ^i) to be equal to 1 for infinitely many towers, but this requires nontrivial global input beyond the current toolkit.

Next steps
- p-adic logarithm analysis: For E_{p^a}:=u(ζ_{p^a})/(ε·ζ_{p^a}^i), we have E_{p^a}∈1+(ζ−1)^2. Study log E_{p^a} in ℤ_p(ζ_{p^a}); aim to show v_p(log E_{p^a})→∞ as a→∞, and seek criteria under which log E_{p^a}=0 for infinitely many a (then E_{p^a}=1 and apply rigidity).
- Coefficient control from Habiro expansion: express E_{p^a} explicitly via the first few coefficients of the Ohtsuki expansion, bounding its valuation uniformly in terms of a; attempt to show that for infinitely many a the principal unit must be 1.
- Combine two primes: Lemma 1 already fixes a global i. If one can produce exact equalities along μ_{p^∞} for some prime p (infinitely many a), then u=±q^i by the rigidity lemma. The same plan can be attempted for two primes if needed.

Remarks for proofs.md
- Include detailed proofs of Lemma 1 and Proposition 2 (they are short and self-contained), and restate the already-verified results about Laurent-polynomial units and rigidity via τ-injectivity. These provide a coherent “first-order normalization” framework around the canonical exponent i.
