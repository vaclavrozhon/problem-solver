  "summary_md": "Round summary: progress toward Conjecture 7.2 (units of Habiro ring Z[q]^N = {\u00b1q^i}). Proven: torsion units are \u00b11; p-adic congruences along \u03bc_{p^\u221e} and valuation lemmas give uniform truncation control mod p^r; corrected rigidity: if a unit equals \u00b1\u03b6^i at infinitely many prime-power roots then it equals \u00b1q^i (via \u03c4 injectivity on that infinite set). New milestone: any Laurent-polynomial unit in Z[q]^N is \u00b1q^i (finite-field reduction), so alternating sums \u03b3_m (odd m\u22653) are not units. Main remaining gap: upgrade p-adic congruences to infinitely many exact equalities u(\u03b6_{p^a})=\u00b1\u03b6_{p^a}^i (along p-towers). Working plan: p-adic-tower analysis and two-prime synthesis to produce infinite exact matches and apply rigidity.",
  "highlights": [
    "Torsion units are trivial: u^m=1 \u21d2 u=\u00b11.",
    "Laurent-polynomial units resolved: g\u2208Z[q,q^{-1}] unit in Z[q]^N implies g=\u00b1q^i; hence \u03b3_m (odd m\u22653) are not units.",
    "p-adic congruence: for odd p and primitive p^a-root \u03b6, u(\u03b6)\u2261u(1) (mod p) and v_\ud835\udd2d((\u03b6)_n) gives uniform truncation mod p^r.",
    "First-order matching: canonical exponent i=u\u2032(1)/u(1)\u2208Z and u(\u03b6)\u2261\u03b5\u00b7\u03b6^i (mod (\u03b6\u22121)^2).",
    "Rigidity (corrected): infinitely many exact evaluations u(\u03b6)=\u00b1\u03b6^i at prime-power \u03b6 imply u=\u00b1q^i via \u03c4_{N,Z} injectivity.",
    "Auxiliary global constraint: \u220f_{\u03b6^n=1}u(\u03b6)=\u00b11 (determinant/product identity)."
