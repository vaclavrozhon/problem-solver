  "summary_md": "Round 3: Work remains blocked because the verbatim statement of Conjecture 7.2 and its prerequisite definitions are missing. The team issued a high-priority RFI (paste exact conjecture text, referenced definitions/lemmas, surrounding context, known special cases/computational evidence, and subject-area relation). An intake checklist was specified (clarify quantifiers/domains, enumerate degenerate/boundary cases, check reformulations, list extremal candidates). Counterexample-search blueprints were proposed for several domains (graphs/combinatorics, number theory, inequalities/analysis, geometry). A post-intake workflow (formalize \u2192 edge-case checks \u2192 small-instance search \u2192 structural lemmas \u2192 triage) and documentation rules (notes.md exploratory, proofs.md verified, output.md milestones) were reiterated. Immediate next step: provide the missing statement and all supporting material so the outlined plan can proceed.",
  "highlights": [
    "Blocked: cannot proceed without the exact text of Conjecture 7.2 and referenced definitions/lemmas.",
    "High-priority RFI requested: verbatim conjecture, surrounding paragraphs (conventions/hidden assumptions), referenced definitions/lemmas, known special cases or computational evidence, and subject-area context.",
    "Intake checklist set: clarify quantifiers/domains, enumerate trivial/degenerate/boundary cases, verify equivalence of reformulations, and list candidate extremal configurations to test sharpness.",
    "Counterexample-search blueprints provided by domain: canonical small-n enumeration for graphs, brute-force/sieve for arithmetic, parametrized-family probes for inequalities, small rational constructions and perturbations for geometry.",
    "Post-intake workflow: (1) formalize self-contained statement, (2) run edge-case checks and small-instance searches, (3) develop first structural lemmas, (4) triage (minimize/document counterexamples or escalate toward proof).",
    "Documentation discipline reiterated: exploratory work stays in notes.md; only fully verified arguments go to proofs.md; output.md updated for decisive milestones. (Source: 'Round 3 \u2014 Escalation and Information Requirements')"

  "next_questions": [
    "Please paste the verbatim text of Conjecture 7.2 and all referenced definitions/lemmas, including the surrounding paragraphs to capture conventions and hidden assumptions.",
    "Provide subject-area context and any known special cases, previously verified instances, or computational evidence that bear on 7.2.",
    "State computational constraints and allowed tooling (time/instance limits, preferred languages/packages) if you want an automated counterexample search performed."
