Round 3: Work remains blocked because the verbatim statement of Conjecture 7.2 and its prerequisite definitions are missing. The team issued a high-priority RFI (paste exact conjecture text, referenced definitions/lemmas, surrounding context, known special cases/computational evidence, and subject-area relation). An intake checklist was specified (clarify quantifiers/domains, enumerate degenerate/boundary cases, check reformulations, list extremal candidates). Counterexample-search blueprints were proposed for several domains (graphs/combinatorics, number theory, inequalities/analysis, geometry). A post-intake workflow (formalize → edge-case checks → small-instance search → structural lemmas → triage) and documentation rules (notes.md exploratory, proofs.md verified, output.md milestones) were reiterated. Immediate next step: provide the missing statement and all supporting material so the outlined plan can proceed.
