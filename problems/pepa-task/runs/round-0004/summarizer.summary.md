Round summary: progress toward Conjecture 7.2 (units of Habiro ring Z[q]^N = {±q^i}). Proven: torsion units are ±1; p-adic congruences along μ_{p^∞} and valuation lemmas give uniform truncation control mod p^r; corrected rigidity: if a unit equals ±ζ^i at infinitely many prime-power roots then it equals ±q^i (via τ injectivity on that infinite set). New milestone: any Laurent-polynomial unit in Z[q]^N is ±q^i (finite-field reduction), so alternating sums γ_m (odd m≥3) are not units. Main remaining gap: upgrade p-adic congruences to infinitely many exact equalities u(ζ_{p^a})=±ζ_{p^a}^i (along p-towers). Working plan: p-adic-tower analysis and two-prime synthesis to produce infinite exact matches and apply rigidity.
