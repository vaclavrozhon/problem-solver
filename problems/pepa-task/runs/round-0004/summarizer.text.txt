{"summary_md":"Round summary: progress toward Conjecture 7.2 (units of Habiro ring Z[q]^N = {±q^i}). Proven: torsion units are ±1; p-adic congruences along μ_{p^∞} and valuation lemmas give uniform truncation control mod p^r; corrected rigidity: if a unit equals ±ζ^i at infinitely many prime-power roots then it equals ±q^i (via τ injectivity on that infinite set). New milestone: any Laurent-polynomial unit in Z[q]^N is ±q^i (finite-field reduction), so alternating sums γ_m (odd m≥3) are not units. Main remaining gap: upgrade p-adic congruences to infinitely many exact equalities u(ζ_{p^a})=±ζ_{p^a}^i (along p-towers). Working plan: p-adic-tower analysis and two-prime synthesis to produce infinite exact matches and apply rigidity.","highlights":["Torsion units are trivial: u^m=1 ⇒ u=±1.","Laurent-polynomial units resolved: g∈Z[q,q^{-1}] unit in Z[q]^N implies g=±q^i; hence γ_m (odd m≥3) are not units.","p-adic congruence: for odd p and primitive p^a-root ζ, u(ζ)≡u(1) (mod p) and v_𝔭((ζ)_n) gives uniform truncation mod p^r.","First-order matching: canonical exponent i=u′(1)/u(1)∈Z and u(ζ)≡ε·ζ^i (mod (ζ−1)^2).","Rigidity (corrected): infinitely many exact evaluations u(ζ)=±ζ^i at prime-power ζ imply u=±q^i via τ_{N,Z} injectivity.","Auxiliary global constraint: ∏_{ζ^n=1}u(ζ)=±1 (determinant/product identity)."],"next_questions":["Find a mechanism to upgrade p-adic congruences along μ_{p^∞} to infinitely many exact equalities u(ζ_{p^a})=±ζ_{p^a}^i (or produce a counterexample).","Carry out the p-adic-tower analysis and two-prime synthesis to force the same exponent i for two primes and then apply τ-injectivity to conclude u=±q^i.","Fix the precise statement of Conjecture 7.2 to target (unit-group characterization vs. general τ-injectivity) and prioritize final proof steps." ,"citations:["]}
