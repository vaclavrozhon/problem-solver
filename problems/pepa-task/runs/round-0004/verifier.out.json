  "feedback_md": "Overall, this round made solid, rigorous additions toward the units conjecture. The classification of Laurent-polynomial Habiro-units is now correct and complete: if g\u2208\u2124[q,q^{-1}] is a unit in \u2124[q]^\u2115, then g=\u00b1q^i. The finite-field reduction argument is the cleanest proof; please standardize on it (Schur\u2019s theorem is optional). This immediately settles \u03b3_m non-units. The p-adic valuation lemmas for \u03b6^k\u22121 and (\u03b6)_n, and the resulting truncation control modulo p^r, are correct: for any r there exists N(r) with (\u03b6)_n\u22610 mod p^r for all n\u2265N(r), uniformly in the level a. Note, however, that for fixed n there is no uniform-in-a lower bound on v_p((\u03b6)_n); both statements are compatible\u2014please phrase truncation claims as tail bounds (n\u2265N(r)).\n\nProver 3\u2019s \u201cslope\u201d lemma u\u2032(1)/u(1)\u2208\u2124 and first-order matching u(\u03b6)\u2261u(1)\u00b7\u03b6^i mod (\u03b6\u22121)^2 (p odd) are correct and useful to identify a canonical exponent i for comparison with \u00b1q^i. The determinant identity \u220f_{\u03b6^n=1}u(\u03b6)=\u00b11 and the rigidity lemma via infinitely many exact matches (using Theorem 2) remain key tools.\n\nBlocking gap: We still lack a mechanism to upgrade p-adic congruences to infinitely many exact equalities u(\u03b6_{p^a})=\u00b1\u03b6_{p^a}^i. The uniform truncation tail helps modularly but does not on its own force exact values across infinitely many levels.\n\nNext steps:\n- Formalize and keep in proofs.md: (i) Laurent-polynomial classification (finite-field reduction), (ii) valuation/truncation lemmas, (iii) slope and first-order matching.\n- Pursue a tower-lifting criterion in \u2124_p(\u03b6_{p^a}): analyze E_{p^a}=u(\u03b6_{p^a})/(\u03b5\u00b7\u03b6_{p^a}^i)\u22081+(\u03b6\u22121)^2; attempt to prove E_{p^a}=1 for infinitely many a (e.g., via growth of valuations/logarithm or a lifting from \u03a6_{p^a} to \u03a6_{p^{a+1}} under nondegeneracy conditions).\n- Try a two-prime synthesis to pin down the same i and conclude by \u03c4-injectivity.\n- Avoid the previously flawed \u201cchain injectivity\u201d approach; it is not needed here.",

For derivatives, (q)_1=1\u2212q so (q)_1\u2032(1)=\u22121, and for n\u22652 the product (q)_n=\u220f_{k=1}^n(1\u2212q^k) has derivative 0 at q=1 because each summand\u2019s product contains a factor (1\u22121^\u2113)=0 with \u2113\u2260j.
