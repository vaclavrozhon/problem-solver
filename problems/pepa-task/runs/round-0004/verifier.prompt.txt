=== SYSTEM ===
You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md, proofs.md, and output.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers
- notes.md (informal progress & exploratory work so far)
- proofs.md (rigorous proofs & detailed mathematics so far)
- output.md (main results summary so far)

**Three-tier file system guidelines**:
- **notes.md**: Readable running log of exploratory work, intuitions, failed attempts, ideas. Prefer appending. Replace only if old notes are clearly misleading. Should be self-contained.
- **proofs.md**: Complete rigorous mathematical proofs with full details. Contains proven lemmas, theorems, and detailed derivations. Only add mathematically verified content here.
- **output.md**: ONLY the main problem results. Think twice before adding anything. Should contain a concise summary of the most important theorems that directly advance the main problem. Extremely selective.

Tasks:
1) Audit rigor: identify unjustified steps, false statements, missing lemmas; produce minimal counterexamples.
2) Triage value: separate genuine progress from noise.
3) Guide next steps: propose what provers should try next.

**Return strictly JSON**:
{
  "feedback_md": "Detailed critique of prover outputs (≥200 words). Include concrete next-step suggestions.",
  "summary_md": "Concise summary of this round's work for summarizer.",
  "verdict": "promising|uncertain|unlikely",
  "blocking_issues": ["List of issues preventing progress"],
  "per_prover": [{"prover_id": "01", "brief_feedback": "feedback", "score": "promising|uncertain|unlikely"}],
  "notes_update": {"action": "append|replace", "content": "Markdown for notes.md"},
  "proofs_update": {"action": "append|replace", "content": "Markdown for proofs.md"}, 
  "output_update": {"action": "append|replace", "content": "Markdown for output.md"}
}

**Verdict definitions**:
- **promising**: Significant mathematical progress, publishable results, or clear path to solution
- **uncertain**: Some progress but with unresolved issues or incomplete reasoning  
- **unlikely**: No meaningful progress, fundamentally flawed approaches, or just exploratory work

**Update guidelines**:
- Use null for any update field you don't want to modify
- notes_update: Include informal reasoning, failed attempts, intuitions, exploratory work
- proofs_update: Only include complete, rigorous proofs that you have verified
- output_update: Only include main problem results that directly advance toward the solution

# Research Notes



# Round 1 — Setup and Missing Information

Status: The exact statement of Conjecture 7.2 is not available. We cannot proceed with proof/disproof or auditing without it.

Requested information (RFI):
- Verbatim text of Conjecture 7.2, including all hypotheses, variable ranges, and quantifiers.
- Definitions/notation from earlier sections that 7.2 depends on.
- Subject area/context (e.g., combinatorics, number theory, analysis, geometry) and the role of 7.2.
- Any known special cases, partial results, or previously verified instances.
- Computational constraints (time/space limits) for small-case exploration if needed.

Proposed workflow once 7.2 is provided:
1) Formalization: Rewrite the conjecture precisely; isolate parameters; identify implicit assumptions.
2) Sanity checks: Evaluate trivial/edge cases (small n, degenerate structures, extremal parameter values). Record any immediate necessary conditions.
3) Counterexample search: Design a small-instance enumeration/testing harness tailored to the domain (e.g., Sage/Pari for arithmetic, NetworkX/SAT/ILP for graphs/combinatorics). Define stopping criteria and logging format.
4) Structural approach: Attempt reductions (monotonicity, subadditivity, hereditary properties), identify invariants, and explore canonical forms.
5) Proof avenues: Map applicable standard techniques (e.g., compactness, extremal combinatorics, spectral bounds, convexity/majorization, regularity, concentration inequalities). Draft candidate lemmas.
6) Documentation: Keep clean separation—exploratory notes here; fully-verified results in proofs.md; only major milestones in output.md.

Risk register (potential failure modes to test early):
- Boundary/degenerate counterexamples violating hidden assumptions.
- Dependence on non-stated regularity/positivity conditions.
- Non-equivalence between common reformulations (ensure implications are two-sided before using them).

Next actions pending RFI:
- Await the exact statement and definitions.
- Once received, immediately execute steps (1)–(3), then triage based on findings.

# Round 2 — Coordination While Awaiting the Statement

Status: Still blocked by the absence of the verbatim statement of Conjecture 7.2 and its dependent definitions/notation.

What we need (RFI reiteration):
- Exact text of Conjecture 7.2 with all hypotheses, quantifiers, domains.
- Any definitions/lemmas it depends on (paste directly for completeness).
- Context: subject area and how 7.2 connects to prior results.
- Known special cases or computational evidence, if any.

Readiness plan (to execute immediately after receiving 7.2):
- Formalization: restate the conjecture self-contained; list parameters; identify edge/degenerate cases; note any monotonicity/closure properties.
- Edge-case checklist: test trivial parameter values (e.g., smallest sizes, zero/empty structures, extremal bounds). Record any immediate necessary conditions.
- Counterexample search template: define instance generator; property checker; logging schema (instance, parameters, pass/fail, witness); stopping rules for small cases.
- Structural toolkit mapping: identify candidate techniques (e.g., compactness, extremal arguments, spectral/convex tools) aligned with the conjecture’s domain.

Division of labor proposal:
- Prover A: formalization + immediate corollaries/normal forms.
- Prover B: implement small-instance enumeration/testing and report minimal counterexamples if found.
- Prover C: literature scan for related theorems/lemmas to reuse and potential equivalences.

Documentation discipline:
- Only exploratory ideas here in notes.md.
- Fully verified lemmas/proofs go to proofs.md with complete details.
- output.md updated only for decisive milestones (proof, disproof, or sharp bounds).

Blocking risks:
- Ambiguous quantifiers or hidden assumptions.
- Heavy dependence on earlier definitions not restated.
- Computational intractability without problem-specific pruning.
