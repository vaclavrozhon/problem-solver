We verified: (1) Laurent-polynomial Habiro-units are exactly ±q^i; γ_m are not units. (2) p-adic valuation lemmas and a uniform tail truncation modulo p^r across μ_{p^∞}. (3) A canonical exponent i via u′(1)/u(1) and first-order matching u(ζ)≡u(1)·ζ^i mod (ζ−1)^2 for p odd. Main gap: producing infinitely many exact monomial evaluations along a p-power tower to trigger τ-injectivity. Verdict: uncertain.
