{"feedback_md":"Overall, this round made solid, rigorous additions toward the units conjecture. The classification of Laurent-polynomial Habiro-units is now correct and complete: if g∈ℤ[q,q^{-1}] is a unit in ℤ[q]^ℕ, then g=±q^i. The finite-field reduction argument is the cleanest proof; please standardize on it (Schur’s theorem is optional). This immediately settles γ_m non-units. The p-adic valuation lemmas for ζ^k−1 and (ζ)_n, and the resulting truncation control modulo p^r, are correct: for any r there exists N(r) with (ζ)_n≡0 mod p^r for all n≥N(r), uniformly in the level a. Note, however, that for fixed n there is no uniform-in-a lower bound on v_p((ζ)_n); both statements are compatible—please phrase truncation claims as tail bounds (n≥N(r)).\n\nProver 3’s “slope” lemma u′(1)/u(1)∈ℤ and first-order matching u(ζ)≡u(1)·ζ^i mod (ζ−1)^2 (p odd) are correct and useful to identify a canonical exponent i for comparison with ±q^i. The determinant identity ∏_{ζ^n=1}u(ζ)=±1 and the rigidity lemma via infinitely many exact matches (using Theorem 2) remain key tools.\n\nBlocking gap: We still lack a mechanism to upgrade p-adic congruences to infinitely many exact equalities u(ζ_{p^a})=±ζ_{p^a}^i. The uniform truncation tail helps modularly but does not on its own force exact values across infinitely many levels.\n\nNext steps:\n- Formalize and keep in proofs.md: (i) Laurent-polynomial classification (finite-field reduction), (ii) valuation/truncation lemmas, (iii) slope and first-order matching.\n- Pursue a tower-lifting criterion in ℤ_p(ζ_{p^a}): analyze E_{p^a}=u(ζ_{p^a})/(ε·ζ_{p^a}^i)∈1+(ζ−1)^2; attempt to prove E_{p^a}=1 for infinitely many a (e.g., via growth of valuations/logarithm or a lifting from Φ_{p^a} to Φ_{p^{a+1}} under nondegeneracy conditions).\n- Try a two-prime synthesis to pin down the same i and conclude by τ-injectivity.\n- Avoid the previously flawed “chain injectivity” approach; it is not needed here.","summary_md":"We verified: (1) Laurent-polynomial Habiro-units are exactly ±q^i; γ_m are not units.

Let u∈Z[q]^N be a unit with Habiro expansion u(q)=∑_{n≥0} a_n(q) (q)_n, a_n∈Z[q]. Then u(1)=a_0(1)∈{±1} and u′(1)=a_0′(1)−a_1(1). In particular, i:=u′(1)/u(1)∈Z.\nProof. Since (q)_0=1 and (q)_n(1)=0 for n≥1, u(1)=a_0(1). For derivatives, (q)_1=1−q so (q)_1′(1)=−1, and for n≥2 the product (q)_n=∏_{k=1}^n(1−q^k) has derivative 0 at q=1 because each summand’s product contains a factor (1−1^ℓ)=0 with ℓ≠j. Hence u′(1)=a_0′(1)−a_1(1). Since u(1)=±1, i∈Z. ∎\n\nProposition (first-order p-adic matching along μ_{p^∞}). Let p be an odd prime, u∈U(Z[q]^N), ε:=u(1), and i:=u′(1)/u(1).

Substituting X=ζ−1 (which is topologically nilpotent in Z_p(ζ)) gives u(ζ)≡ε+ε i(ζ−1) mod (ζ−1)^2. Also (1+X)^i≡1+iX mod X^2, so ζ^i≡1+i(ζ−1) mod (ζ−1)^2.
