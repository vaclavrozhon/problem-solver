  "feedback_md": "We remain fully blocked: the verbatim statement of Conjecture 7.2 and its dependent definitions/notation have not been provided. Without the exact hypotheses, quantifiers, and domains, no rigorous proof or disproof can proceed, and there is nothing to audit from provers. Any attempt to fill in gaps by guesswork would risk invalid lines of attack and contaminate proofs.md with unusable material.\n\nActionable guidance and next steps:\n- Provide the verbatim text of Conjecture 7.2, including every hypothesis and cross-referenced definition or lemma (paste those definitions inline to avoid ambiguity). Include the surrounding paragraph(s) to capture hidden assumptions and conventions.\n- Specify the subject area and intent: is 7.2 a strengthening of an earlier result, a bound conjecture, an existence statement, or an equivalence? State any known special cases, borderline instances, or numerical evidence.\n- Once the statement arrives, we will immediately: (1) restate it in a self-contained format; (2) run sanity checks on edge/degenerate cases; (3) define a small-instance search strategy to stress-test for counterexamples; (4) identify structural lemmas that would enable an inductive or extremal approach.\n\nDocumentation discipline remains crucial: exploratory reasoning goes to notes.md; only fully verified arguments enter proofs.md; output.md is reserved for decisive milestones (proof, counterexample, or sharp bounds). Until we get the statement, we will not add any mathematical content to proofs.md or output.md.\n\nTo expedite once unblocked, please also provide: (i) parameter ranges and any normalizations (e.g., scaling invariance, monotonicity) that may reduce cases; (ii) canonical examples believed to be extremal; (iii) any computational constraints if small-case enumeration is expected to be heavy.\n\nIn short: supply the precise statement and dependencies; we will then execute the prepared workflow and triage quickly between proof avenues and counterexample search.",
