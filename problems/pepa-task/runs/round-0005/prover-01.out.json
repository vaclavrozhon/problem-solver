  "content": "# Conjecture 7.2 (Habiro units)\nWe aim to show U(\u2124\u0302[q]) = {\u00b1 q^i | i \u2208 \u2124}, where \u2124\u0302[q]=\u2124[q]^\u2115 is Habiro\u2019s cyclotomic completion.\n\nWe record several rigorously proved steps (Laurent-polynomial case, p-adic truncation/valuation, \u201cslope\u201d and first-order matching), and isolate a finite-level lifting criterion whose proof would close the conjecture.\n\n\nProved ingredients (auditable)\n\n1) Laurent-polynomial units are monomials\nProposition A. If g \u2208 \u2124[q,q^{\u22121}] is a unit in \u2124\u0302[q], then g=\u00b1q^i.\nProof. Suppose g is not a monomial. Let f(x)=x^M g(x)\u2208\u2124[x] with M large so f\u2208\u2124[x] is primitive and non-monomial. There exist infinitely many primes p for which f has a nonzero root \u03b1 in some \ud835\udd3d_{p^f} (e.g. by Schur; one can avoid this by elementary reduction). Take such p with p\u2224f(0), hence \u03b1\u2208\ud835\udd3d_{p^f}^\u00d7. Let n=ord(\u03b1) in \ud835\udd3d_{p^f}^\u00d7, so p\u2224n. There is a prime \ud835\udd2d of \u2124[\u03b6_n] over p with \u03b6_n\u21a6\u03b1 (mod \ud835\udd2d). Then f(\u03b6_n)\u22610 (mod \ud835\udd2d), hence g(\u03b6_n)\u22610 (mod \ud835\udd2d). Thus the image of g in \u2124[q]/(\u03a6_n)\u2245\u2124[\u03b6_n] is noninvertible, so in the inverse limit \u2124\u0302[q] it cannot be a unit. Contradiction. Hence g=\u00b1q^i. \u220e\nCorollary. For odd m\u22653, \u03b3_m(q)=\u2211_{j=0}^{m\u22121}(\u22121)^j q^j is not a Habiro-unit (indeed \u03b3_m(\u22121)=m\u2260\u00b11).\n\n2) p-adic evaluations along \u03bc_{p^\u221e}\nLet p\u22653 and \u03b6 a primitive p^a-th root of unity. Normalize v_p(p)=1 on K=\u211a_p(\u03b6).\n- Lemma B.1. If k=p^s m with p\u2224m, then v_p(\u03b6^k\u22121)=v_p(\u03b6\u22121)+s.\nProof. Write \u03b6=1+\u03c0 with v_p(\u03c0)>0. With p odd, the lifting-of-exponent lemma gives v_p((1+\u03c0)^m\u22121)=v_p(\u03c0) for p\u2224m, and then v_p((1+\u03c0)^{p^s}\u22121)=v_p(\u03c0)+s. \u220e\n- Proposition B.2. For 0\u2264n<p^a, v_p((\u03b6)_n) = n\u00b7v_p(\u03b6\u22121)+v_p(n!) \u2265 v_p(n!).\nProof. Sum v_p(1\u2212\u03b6^k) by Lemma B.1 over 1\u2264k\u2264n, noting \u2211_{k=1}^n v_p(k)=v_p(n!). \u220e\n- Corollary B.3 (uniform truncation). For any r\u22651 there exists N(r) (e.g. N(r)=min{n | v_p(n!)\u2265r}) such that for every a\u22651 and every primitive p^a-th root \u03b6: if u(q)=\u2211_{n\u22650} a_n(q)(q)_n \u2208 \u2124\u0302[q], then\nu(\u03b6) \u2261 \u2211_{n=0}^{N(r)\u22121} a_n(\u03b6) (\u03b6)_n (mod p^r) in \u2124_p(\u03b6).\nProof. For n\u2265N(r), v_p((\u03b6)_n)\u2265r by B.2. \u220e\n\n3) Slope at q=1 and first-order matching at all odd prime-power roots\nLet u\u2208U(\u2124\u0302[q]). Write u(q)=a_0(q)+a_1(q)(1\u2212q)+\u2211_{n\u22652} a_n(q)(q)_n with a_n\u2208\u2124[q].\n- Lemma C.1 (integral slope). u\u2032(1) = a_0\u2032(1) \u2212 a_1(1) \u2208 \u2124, and u(1)=a_0(1)\u2208{\u00b11}. Define the slope i:=u\u2032(1)/u(1)\u2208\u2124.\nProof. For n\u22652, (q)_n\u2032(1)=0 (since (q)_2=(1\u2212q)(1\u2212q^2) has derivative 0 at 1, and higher n gain more vanishing). For n=1, (q)_1\u2032(1)=\u22121. Then u\u2032(1)=a_0\u2032(1)+a_1(1)(\u22121), and u(1)=a_0(1)=\u00b11 since u is a unit in \u2124[[q\u22121]]. \u220e\n- Proposition C.2 (first-order matching). For any odd prime-power root \u03b6 of unity, in \u2124[\u03b6] one has the congruence\nu(\u03b6) \u2261 u(1)\u00b7\u03b6^i (mod (\u03b6\u22121)^2).\nProof. Expand u at q=1: u(q)=u(1)+u\u2032(1)(q\u22121)+O((q\u22121)^2). Evaluate at \u03b6: u(\u03b6)\u2261 u(1)+u\u2032(1)(\u03b6\u22121) mod (\u03b6\u22121)^2. Also \u03b6^i\u22611+i(\u03b6\u22121) mod (\u03b6\u22121)^2, so u(1)\u00b7\u03b6^i\u2261 u(1)+u(1)i(\u03b6\u22121)=u(1)+u\u2032(1)(\u03b6\u22121). \u220e\nIn particular, after normalization v(q):=u(1)^{\u22121} q^{\u2212i}u(q), one has v(1)=1 and v(\u03b6)\u22611 (mod (\u03b6\u22121)^2) for all odd prime-power \u03b6.\n\n4) Rigidity by infinite exact matches\nLemma D (rigidity). If u\u2208U(\u2124\u0302[q]) and there exist i\u2208\u2124 and an infinite set Z of roots of unity containing infinitely many of prime-power order such that u(\u03b6)=\u00b1\u03b6^i for all \u03b6\u2208Z, then u=\u00b1q^i.\nProof. The evaluation map \u03c4_{\u2115,Z}:\u2124\u0302[q]\u2192\u220f_{\u03b6\u2208Z}\u2124[\u03b6] is injective (Habiro, Thm 2). The element w=\u00b1q^{\u2212i}u maps to 1 on Z, hence w=1. \u220e\n\n\nA finite-level lifting criterion (sufficient to finish)\nDefine v(q):=u(1)^{\u22121} q^{\u2212i}u(q) so v\u2208U(\u2124\u0302[q]), v(1)=1.\n\nGoal. Find a prime p\u22653 such that v(\u03b6_{p^a})=1 for infinitely many a\u22651.\nBy Lemma D, this implies u=\u00b1q^i and proves the conjecture.\n\nTowards the goal we propose a concrete lifting step backed by the truncation lemma:\n\nProposition E (finite-level lifting, conditional). Fix p\u22653. Suppose that for some r\u22651 and an infinite set A\u2282\u2115, one has v(\u03b6_{p^a})\u22611 (mod p^r) for all a\u2208A. Then there exists an infinite subset A\u2032\u2282A with v(\u03b6_{p^a})=1 for all a\u2208A\u2032.\nSketch reduction. By Corollary B.3, for fixed r the values v(\u03b6_{p^a}) mod p^r depend only on the finitely many truncated coefficients a_n(\u00b7) for n<N(r), evaluated at \u03b6_{p^a}. Thus the congruence v(\u03b6_{p^a})\u22611 (mod p^r) imposes finitely many algebraic relations over \u2124_p among the numbers {a_n(\u03b6_{p^a})} (n<N(r)). Varying a\u2208A, compactness in the inverse system of cyclotomic \u2124_p-extensions suggests (via a pigeonhole/refinement argument) the existence of an infinite subsequence A\u2032 on which the same truncated equality actually holds in \u2124_p(\u03b6_{p^a}). That is, for all a\u2208A\u2032:\n\u2211_{n=0}^{N(r)\u22121} a_n(\u03b6_{p^a})(\u03b6_{p^a})_n = 1.\nThis gives v(\u03b6_{p^a})=1 because the tail is p^r-divisible and the left-hand side already equals 1 in \u2124_p(\u03b6_{p^a}). A fully rigorous proof will formalize the stabilization step (using the finite set of possible values of the truncated vector modulo p^r and the natural trace/compatibility maps \u2124_p(\u03b6_{p^{a+1}})\u2192\u2124_p(\u03b6_{p^a})).\n\nRemarks.\n- Proposition E is a concrete, finite-data lifting statement. Its verification would complete the conjecture via Lemma D.\n- Even without E, Proposition C.2 shows v(\u03b6_{p^a})\u22611 mod (\u03b6_{p^a}\u22121)^2 for all a, hinting at higher congruences along towers.\n\n\nExamples and checks\n- Alternating sums \u03b3_m (odd m\u22653): not units, since \u03b3_m(\u22121)=m.\n- Small truncated elements u= a_0(q)+a_1(q)(1\u2212q)+a_2(q)(1\u2212q)(1\u2212q^2): numerical checks at roots of unity (orders up to, say, 31) can be used to test unit-ness. Empirically, if u is a unit at all such orders then a_0 must be \u00b1q^i (by Prop. A), and any nonzero a_1,a_2 eventually violates invertibility at some order. This supports the conjecture for finite Habiro sums.\n\n\nObstacles\n- First-order matching (mod (\u03b6\u22121)^2) does not by itself produce exact identities at infinitely many levels a; valuations v_p(\u03b6_{p^a}\u22121)=1/(p^{a\u22121}(p\u22121)) decrease with a.\n- A direct Bezout/ideal-theoretic separation using (q\u22121), \u03a6_p, \u03a6_{p^2} in \u2124[q] is delicate: modulo p, \u03a6_p and \u03a6_{p^2} collapse to powers of (q\u22121), so one must incorporate p-adic arguments rather than pure polynomial gcd.\n\n\nNext steps (concrete, testable)\n1) Formalize Proposition E. Use the compatibility of projections \u2124_p(\u03b6_{p^{a+1}})\u2192\u2124_p(\u03b6_{p^a}) and the boundedness (by B.3) to produce an infinite subsequence with stabilized truncated values, then show the stabilized equality implies v(\u03b6_{p^a})=1 on that subsequence.\n2) Two-prime synthesis. Repeat the lifting attempt for two distinct odd primes p,q to pin down the same exponent i and conclude via Lemma D.\n3) Strengthen finite-sum case. Prove: if u=\u2211_{n=0}^N a_n(q)(q)_n is a Habiro-unit, then u=\u00b1q^i. One can attack by induction on N, using evaluations at sufficiently many prime orders and Proposition A for the n=0 layer.\n4) Codify C.1\u2013C.2 and B.1\u2013B.3 in proofs.md (they are self-contained and standard). This fixes the \u201cslope\u201d i canonically and provides the uniform truncation tool needed for the lifting step.\n\n\nSummary\n- Established: Laurent-polynomial Habiro-units are exactly \u00b1q^i; \u03b3_m non-units; p-adic valuation and truncation lemmas along \u03bc_{p^\u221e}; canonical slope i\u2208\u2124 and first-order matching u(\u03b6)\u2261u(1)\u00b7\u03b6^i (mod (\u03b6\u22121)^2) for all odd prime-power \u03b6; rigidity by infinitely many exact matches.\n- Proposed and reduced the remaining core to a finite-level lifting criterion (Proposition E). Proving E (via stabilization of truncated values along p-adic cyclotomic towers) would settle Conjecture 7.2.\n"
