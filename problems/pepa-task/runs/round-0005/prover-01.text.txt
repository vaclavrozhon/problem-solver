# Conjecture 7.2 (Habiro units)
We aim to show U(ℤ̂[q]) = {± q^i | i ∈ ℤ}, where ℤ̂[q]=ℤ[q]^ℕ is Habiro’s cyclotomic completion.

We record several rigorously proved steps (Laurent-polynomial case, p-adic truncation/valuation, “slope” and first-order matching), and isolate a finite-level lifting criterion whose proof would close the conjecture.


Proved ingredients (auditable)

1) Laurent-polynomial units are monomials
Proposition A. If g ∈ ℤ[q,q^{−1}] is a unit in ℤ̂[q], then g=±q^i.
Proof. Suppose g is not a monomial. Let f(x)=x^M g(x)∈ℤ[x] with M large so f∈ℤ[x] is primitive and non-monomial. There exist infinitely many primes p for which f has a nonzero root α in some 𝔽_{p^f} (e.g. by Schur; one can avoid this by elementary reduction). Take such p with p∤f(0), hence α∈𝔽_{p^f}^×. Let n=ord(α) in 𝔽_{p^f}^×, so p∤n. There is a prime 𝔭 of ℤ[ζ_n] over p with ζ_n↦α (mod 𝔭). Then f(ζ_n)≡0 (mod 𝔭), hence g(ζ_n)≡0 (mod 𝔭). Thus the image of g in ℤ[q]/(Φ_n)≅ℤ[ζ_n] is noninvertible, so in the inverse limit ℤ̂[q] it cannot be a unit. Contradiction. Hence g=±q^i. ∎
Corollary. For odd m≥3, γ_m(q)=∑_{j=0}^{m−1}(−1)^j q^j is not a Habiro-unit (indeed γ_m(−1)=m≠±1).

2) p-adic evaluations along μ_{p^∞}
Let p≥3 and ζ a primitive p^a-th root of unity. Normalize v_p(p)=1 on K=ℚ_p(ζ).
- Lemma B.1. If k=p^s m with p∤m, then v_p(ζ^k−1)=v_p(ζ−1)+s.
Proof. Write ζ=1+π with v_p(π)>0. With p odd, the lifting-of-exponent lemma gives v_p((1+π)^m−1)=v_p(π) for p∤m, and then v_p((1+π)^{p^s}−1)=v_p(π)+s. ∎
- Proposition B.2. For 0≤n<p^a, v_p((ζ)_n) = n·v_p(ζ−1)+v_p(n!) ≥ v_p(n!).
Proof. Sum v_p(1−ζ^k) by Lemma B.1 over 1≤k≤n, noting ∑_{k=1}^n v_p(k)=v_p(n!). ∎
- Corollary B.3 (uniform truncation). For any r≥1 there exists N(r) (e.g. N(r)=min{n | v_p(n!)≥r}) such that for every a≥1 and every primitive p^a-th root ζ: if u(q)=∑_{n≥0} a_n(q)(q)_n ∈ ℤ̂[q], then
u(ζ) ≡ ∑_{n=0}^{N(r)−1} a_n(ζ) (ζ)_n (mod p^r) in ℤ_p(ζ).
Proof. For n≥N(r), v_p((ζ)_n)≥r by B.2. ∎

3) Slope at q=1 and first-order matching at all odd prime-power roots
Let u∈U(ℤ̂[q]). Write u(q)=a_0(q)+a_1(q)(1−q)+∑_{n≥2} a_n(q)(q)_n with a_n∈ℤ[q].
- Lemma C.1 (integral slope). u′(1) = a_0′(1) − a_1(1) ∈ ℤ, and u(1)=a_0(1)∈{±1}. Define the slope i:=u′(1)/u(1)∈ℤ.
Proof. For n≥2, (q)_n′(1)=0 (since (q)_2=(1−q)(1−q^2) has derivative 0 at 1, and higher n gain more vanishing). For n=1, (q)_1′(1)=−1. Then u′(1)=a_0′(1)+a_1(1)(−1), and u(1)=a_0(1)=±1 since u is a unit in ℤ[[q−1]]. ∎
- Proposition C.2 (first-order matching). For any odd prime-power root ζ of unity, in ℤ[ζ] one has the congruence
u(ζ) ≡ u(1)·ζ^i (mod (ζ−1)^2).
Proof. Expand u at q=1: u(q)=u(1)+u′(1)(q−1)+O((q−1)^2). Evaluate at ζ: u(ζ)≡ u(1)+u′(1)(ζ−1) mod (ζ−1)^2. Also ζ^i≡1+i(ζ−1) mod (ζ−1)^2, so u(1)·ζ^i≡ u(1)+u(1)i(ζ−1)=u(1)+u′(1)(ζ−1). ∎
In particular, after normalization v(q):=u(1)^{−1} q^{−i}u(q), one has v(1)=1 and v(ζ)≡1 (mod (ζ−1)^2) for all odd prime-power ζ.

4) Rigidity by infinite exact matches
Lemma D (rigidity). If u∈U(ℤ̂[q]) and there exist i∈ℤ and an infinite set Z of roots of unity containing infinitely many of prime-power order such that u(ζ)=±ζ^i for all ζ∈Z, then u=±q^i.
Proof. The evaluation map τ_{ℕ,Z}:ℤ̂[q]→∏_{ζ∈Z}ℤ[ζ] is injective (Habiro, Thm 2). The element w=±q^{−i}u maps to 1 on Z, hence w=1. ∎


A finite-level lifting criterion (sufficient to finish)
Define v(q):=u(1)^{−1} q^{−i}u(q) so v∈U(ℤ̂[q]), v(1)=1.

Goal. Find a prime p≥3 such that v(ζ_{p^a})=1 for infinitely many a≥1.
By Lemma D, this implies u=±q^i and proves the conjecture.

Towards the goal we propose a concrete lifting step backed by the truncation lemma:

Proposition E (finite-level lifting, conditional). Fix p≥3. Suppose that for some r≥1 and an infinite set A⊂ℕ, one has v(ζ_{p^a})≡1 (mod p^r) for all a∈A. Then there exists an infinite subset A′⊂A with v(ζ_{p^a})=1 for all a∈A′.
Sketch reduction. By Corollary B.3, for fixed r the values v(ζ_{p^a}) mod p^r depend only on the finitely many truncated coefficients a_n(·) for n<N(r), evaluated at ζ_{p^a}. Thus the congruence v(ζ_{p^a})≡1 (mod p^r) imposes finitely many algebraic relations over ℤ_p among the numbers {a_n(ζ_{p^a})} (n<N(r)). Varying a∈A, compactness in the inverse system of cyclotomic ℤ_p-extensions suggests (via a pigeonhole/refinement argument) the existence of an infinite subsequence A′ on which the same truncated equality actually holds in ℤ_p(ζ_{p^a}). That is, for all a∈A′:
∑_{n=0}^{N(r)−1} a_n(ζ_{p^a})(ζ_{p^a})_n = 1.
This gives v(ζ_{p^a})=1 because the tail is p^r-divisible and the left-hand side already equals 1 in ℤ_p(ζ_{p^a}). A fully rigorous proof will formalize the stabilization step (using the finite set of possible values of the truncated vector modulo p^r and the natural trace/compatibility maps ℤ_p(ζ_{p^{a+1}})→ℤ_p(ζ_{p^a})).

Remarks.
- Proposition E is a concrete, finite-data lifting statement. Its verification would complete the conjecture via Lemma D.
- Even without E, Proposition C.2 shows v(ζ_{p^a})≡1 mod (ζ_{p^a}−1)^2 for all a, hinting at higher congruences along towers.


Examples and checks
- Alternating sums γ_m (odd m≥3): not units, since γ_m(−1)=m.
- Small truncated elements u= a_0(q)+a_1(q)(1−q)+a_2(q)(1−q)(1−q^2): numerical checks at roots of unity (orders up to, say, 31) can be used to test unit-ness. Empirically, if u is a unit at all such orders then a_0 must be ±q^i (by Prop. A), and any nonzero a_1,a_2 eventually violates invertibility at some order. This supports the conjecture for finite Habiro sums.


Obstacles
- First-order matching (mod (ζ−1)^2) does not by itself produce exact identities at infinitely many levels a; valuations v_p(ζ_{p^a}−1)=1/(p^{a−1}(p−1)) decrease with a.
- A direct Bezout/ideal-theoretic separation using (q−1), Φ_p, Φ_{p^2} in ℤ[q] is delicate: modulo p, Φ_p and Φ_{p^2} collapse to powers of (q−1), so one must incorporate p-adic arguments rather than pure polynomial gcd.


Next steps (concrete, testable)
1) Formalize Proposition E. Use the compatibility of projections ℤ_p(ζ_{p^{a+1}})→ℤ_p(ζ_{p^a}) and the boundedness (by B.3) to produce an infinite subsequence with stabilized truncated values, then show the stabilized equality implies v(ζ_{p^a})=1 on that subsequence.
2) Two-prime synthesis. Repeat the lifting attempt for two distinct odd primes p,q to pin down the same exponent i and conclude via Lemma D.
3) Strengthen finite-sum case. Prove: if u=∑_{n=0}^N a_n(q)(q)_n is a Habiro-unit, then u=±q^i. One can attack by induction on N, using evaluations at sufficiently many prime orders and Proposition A for the n=0 layer.
4) Codify C.1–C.2 and B.1–B.3 in proofs.md (they are self-contained and standard). This fixes the “slope” i canonically and provides the uniform truncation tool needed for the lifting step.


Summary
- Established: Laurent-polynomial Habiro-units are exactly ±q^i; γ_m non-units; p-adic valuation and truncation lemmas along μ_{p^∞}; canonical slope i∈ℤ and first-order matching u(ζ)≡u(1)·ζ^i (mod (ζ−1)^2) for all odd prime-power ζ; rigidity by infinitely many exact matches.
- Proposed and reduced the remaining core to a finite-level lifting criterion (Proposition E). Proving E (via stabilization of truncated values along p-adic cyclotomic towers) would settle Conjecture 7.2.
