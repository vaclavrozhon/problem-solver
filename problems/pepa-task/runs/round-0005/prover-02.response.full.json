Conjecture 7.2: U(\u2124[q]^\u2115) = {\u00b1 q^i | i \u2208 \u2124}.\\n\\nRecap of established tools\\n- Evaluation preserves units (for any root of unity \u03b6, ev_\u03b6(u) \u2208 U(\u2124[\u03b6])).\\n- Torsion units are \u00b11.\\n- Injectivity by infinitely many exact matches (Theorem 2): if a unit u satisfies u(\u03b6)=\u00b1\u03b6^i for infinitely many roots of unity \u03b6 of prime-power order, then u=\u00b1q^i.\\n- Laurent-polynomial units are monomials: if g \u2208 \u2124[q,q^{-1}] \u2229 U(\u2124[q]^\u2115) then g=\u00b1q^i. Hence the alternating sums \u03b3_m (odd m\u22653) are not units.\\n\\nNew lemmas and propositions (clean, testable)\\n\\nLemma 1 (Determinant identity at level n; why useful: global constraint on values). For u \u2208 U(\u2124[q]^\u2115) and any n\u22651, one has \u220f_{\u03b6^n=1} u(\u03b6) = \u00b11.\\nProof. Consider multiplication-by-u on the free \u2124-module \u2124[q]/(q^n\u22121), rank n. It is an automorphism, so its determinant is \u00b11. The eigenvalues over \u2102 are {u(\u03b6) | \u03b6^n=1}, hence their product equals the determinant, i.e., \u00b11.\\n\\nLemma 2 (First-order matching at prime-power orders; why useful: defines a canonical exponent). Let u \u2208 U(\u2124[q]^\u2115), write \u03b5 := u(1) \u2208 {\u00b11} and i := u\u2032(1)/\u03b5 \u2208 \u2124 (slope integrality is clear from the expansion in \u2124[[q\u22121]]). Fix an odd prime p and a primitive p^a-th root \u03b6. Then in \u2124_p(\u03b6) one has\\nu(\u03b6) \u2261 \u03b5 \u00b7 \u03b6^i mod (\u03b6\u22121)^2.\\nProof. Embed \u2124[q]^\u2115 \u21aa \u2124_p[[q\u22121]]. Put \u03b4:=\u03b6\u22121 with v_p(\u03b4)>0. Taylor expansion at q=1 yields u(\u03b6)=\u03b5(1 + i \u03b4) + O(\u03b4^2). Also \u03b6^i=(1+\u03b4)^i=1 + i \u03b4 + O(\u03b4^2). Hence the congruence.\\n\\nLemma 3 (CRT exponent gluing; why useful: assembling congruences at coprime orders). Let m,n be coprime and u \u2208 \u2124[q]^\u2115. If for some \u03b5\u2208{\u00b11}, integers i,j one has u \u2261 \u03b5 q^i (mod \u03a6_m) and u \u2261 \u03b5 q^j (mod \u03a6_n), then there exists t modulo mn such that u \u2261 \u03b5 q^t (mod \u03a6_m \u03a6_n). In particular, for any primitive \u03b6_{mn} one has u(\u03b6_{mn})=\u03b5 \u03b6_{mn}^t.\\nProof. In \u2124[q]/(\u03a6_m \u03a6_n) \u2245 \u2124[q]/(\u03a6_m) \u00d7 \u2124[q]/(\u03a6_n), the pair (\u03b5 q^i, \u03b5 q^j) equals \u03b5 (\u03b6_m^i, \u03b6_n^j). Since (\u03b6_m^i, \u03b6_n^j)=(\u03b6_m^t, \u03b6_n^t) for t solving t\u2261i (mod m), t\u2261j (mod n), this pair is the image of \u03b5 q^t.\\n\\nProposition 4 (Values that are roots of unity infinitely often force monomial; why useful: a nontrivial special case of the conjecture). Suppose u \u2208 U(\u2124[q]^\u2115) and there exists an infinite set P of odd primes such that for each p\u2208P and each primitive \u03b6_p of order p we have u(\u03b6_p) \u2208 \u03bc (the group of roots of unity in \u211a(\u03b6_p)). Then u = \u03b5 q^i with \u03b5 = u(1) and i = u\u2032(1)/\u03b5 \u2208 \u2124.\\nProof. For p\u2208P, write u(\u03b6_p) = \u03b7_p \u03b6_p^{k_p} with \u03b7_p \u2208 {\u00b11}. By Lemma 2, u(\u03b6_p) \u2261 \u03b5 \u03b6_p^i mod (\u03b6_p\u22121)^2. Compare first-order terms in \u2124_p(\u03b6_p): write \u03b6_p = 1 + \u03b4 with v_p(\u03b4)>0. Then\\n\u03b7_p (1 + k_p \u03b4) + O(\u03b4^2) = \u03b5 (1 + i \u03b4) + O(\u03b4^2).\\nEquating constant terms gives \u03b7_p = \u03b5, and equating linear terms in \u2124_p yields k_p = i. Therefore u(\u03b6_p) = \u03b5 \u03b6_p^i for all p\u2208P. Since P is infinite and consists of prime orders (prime powers), Theorem 2 (injectivity of \u03c4 over such an infinite set) implies u = \u03b5 q^i.\\n\\nRemarks on p-adic truncation (correction and usage)\\n- Tail vanishing (uniform in the tower): Fix r\u22651. For any odd prime p and any a\u22651, and any primitive \u03b6 of order p^a, (\u03b6)_n \u2261 0 (mod p^r) for all sufficiently large n (depending on r) because v_p((\u03b6)_n)=n\u00b7v_p(\u03b6\u22121)+v_p(n!) \u2192 +\u221e as n\u2192\u221e. This gives useful control of tails when comparing u(\u03b6) modulo p^r across the p-tower.\\n- No uniform-in-a bound at fixed n: For fixed small n, v_p((\u03b6_{p^a})_n) does not admit a uniform-in-a positive lower bound (since v_p(\u03b6_{p^a}\u22121)=1/((p\u22121)p^{a\u22121}) \u2192 0 as a\u2192\u221e). Thus truncation claims should be phrased as tail statements in n, not as fixed-n bounds uniform in a.\\n\\nConsequences and small cases settled\\n- Laurent-polynomial units are monomials (finite-field reduction proof already established). Immediate corollary: \u03b3_m(q)=\u2211_{i=0}^{m\u22121}(\u22121)^i q^i (odd m\u22653) are not units (e.g., \u03b3_m(\u22121)=m\u2260\u00b11).\\n- Prime-level rigidity criterion (direct corollary of Proposition 4): If for infinitely many odd primes p one has u(\u03b6_p)=\u03b5 \u03b6_p^i (with \u03b5=u(1) and fixed i), then u=\u03b5 q^i.\\n- Coprime-order gluing (Lemma 3): Exact congruences at coprime orders assemble to larger squarefree orders. While not directly producing prime-power orders, this supplies a consistency mechanism for building large sets Z for \u03c4-injectivity once many prime-order congruences are known.\\n\\nExamples and tests\\n- Two-term Laurent polynomials aq^r+bq^s (|a|+|b|\u22652) fail to be units by evaluation at \u00b11 unless they are \u00b1q^k.\\n- If u \u2208 U(\u2124[q]^\u2115) and u(\u03b6_p) is a root of unity for infinitely many primes p (e.g., u(\u03b6_p) \u2208 {\u00b1\u03b6_p^k}), then Proposition 4 applies and u = \u00b1 q^i.\\n\\nObstacles\\n- The main remaining gap is to promote p-adic congruences (Lemma 2), which are first-order approximations, to exact equalities u(\u03b6_{p^a}) = \u03b5 \u03b6_{p^a}^i for infinitely many levels a. The tail control provides modular vanishing but does not by itself force exact values across the tower.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Tower-lifting criterion in \u2124_p(\u03b6_{p^a}): For v(q)=\u03b5^{\u22121} q^{\u2212i}u(q), study E_a := v(\u03b6_{p^a}) \u2208 1+(\u03b6_{p^a}\u22121)^2. Seek conditions under which E_a=1 for infinitely many a (e.g., via growth of valuations of E_a\u22121, or a lifting argument from level p to p^2, etc.). A successful criterion for a single odd p would resolve the conjecture via Theorem 2.\\n- Exploit Lemma 3: aim to first obtain exact monomial evaluations for infinitely many primes p (level 1), then conclude by Proposition 4.\\n- Formalize the determinant constraint (Lemma 1) in combination with archimedean or p-adic estimates to rule out \u201ctoo small\u201d deviations E_a across many nth levels.\\n\\nSummary of new, auditable progress\\n- First-order matching lemma (Lemma 2) with a clean p-adic Taylor proof, valid for all odd p and all levels.\\n- CRT exponent gluing (Lemma 3) for coprime orders.\\n- Determinant identity (Lemma 1) for every n.\\n- A nontrivial special case proved (Proposition 4): if u takes root-of-unity values at \u03b6_p for infinitely many primes p, then u is \u00b1 q^i.\\nThese add to the established Laurent-polynomial classification and provide concrete, checkable stepping stones toward the full conjecture.\"}",
