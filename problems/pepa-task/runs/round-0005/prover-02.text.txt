Goal. Conjecture 7.2: U(ℤ[q]^ℕ) = {± q^i | i ∈ ℤ}.

Recap of established tools
- Evaluation preserves units (for any root of unity ζ, ev_ζ(u) ∈ U(ℤ[ζ])).
- Torsion units are ±1.
- Injectivity by infinitely many exact matches (Theorem 2): if a unit u satisfies u(ζ)=±ζ^i for infinitely many roots of unity ζ of prime-power order, then u=±q^i.
- Laurent-polynomial units are monomials: if g ∈ ℤ[q,q^{-1}] ∩ U(ℤ[q]^ℕ) then g=±q^i. Hence the alternating sums γ_m (odd m≥3) are not units.

New lemmas and propositions (clean, testable)

Lemma 1 (Determinant identity at level n; why useful: global constraint on values). For u ∈ U(ℤ[q]^ℕ) and any n≥1, one has ∏_{ζ^n=1} u(ζ) = ±1.
Proof. Consider multiplication-by-u on the free ℤ-module ℤ[q]/(q^n−1), rank n. It is an automorphism, so its determinant is ±1. The eigenvalues over ℂ are {u(ζ) | ζ^n=1}, hence their product equals the determinant, i.e., ±1.

Lemma 2 (First-order matching at prime-power orders; why useful: defines a canonical exponent). Let u ∈ U(ℤ[q]^ℕ), write ε := u(1) ∈ {±1} and i := u′(1)/ε ∈ ℤ (slope integrality is clear from the expansion in ℤ[[q−1]]). Fix an odd prime p and a primitive p^a-th root ζ. Then in ℤ_p(ζ) one has
u(ζ) ≡ ε · ζ^i mod (ζ−1)^2.
Proof. Embed ℤ[q]^ℕ ↪ ℤ_p[[q−1]]. Put δ:=ζ−1 with v_p(δ)>0. Taylor expansion at q=1 yields u(ζ)=ε(1 + i δ) + O(δ^2). Also ζ^i=(1+δ)^i=1 + i δ + O(δ^2). Hence the congruence.

Lemma 3 (CRT exponent gluing; why useful: assembling congruences at coprime orders). Let m,n be coprime and u ∈ ℤ[q]^ℕ. If for some ε∈{±1}, integers i,j one has u ≡ ε q^i (mod Φ_m) and u ≡ ε q^j (mod Φ_n), then there exists t modulo mn such that u ≡ ε q^t (mod Φ_m Φ_n). In particular, for any primitive ζ_{mn} one has u(ζ_{mn})=ε ζ_{mn}^t.
Proof. In ℤ[q]/(Φ_m Φ_n) ≅ ℤ[q]/(Φ_m) × ℤ[q]/(Φ_n), the pair (ε q^i, ε q^j) equals ε (ζ_m^i, ζ_n^j). Since (ζ_m^i, ζ_n^j)=(ζ_m^t, ζ_n^t) for t solving t≡i (mod m), t≡j (mod n), this pair is the image of ε q^t.

Proposition 4 (Values that are roots of unity infinitely often force monomial; why useful: a nontrivial special case of the conjecture). Suppose u ∈ U(ℤ[q]^ℕ) and there exists an infinite set P of odd primes such that for each p∈P and each primitive ζ_p of order p we have u(ζ_p) ∈ μ (the group of roots of unity in ℚ(ζ_p)). Then u = ε q^i with ε = u(1) and i = u′(1)/ε ∈ ℤ.
Proof. For p∈P, write u(ζ_p) = η_p ζ_p^{k_p} with η_p ∈ {±1}. By Lemma 2, u(ζ_p) ≡ ε ζ_p^i mod (ζ_p−1)^2. Compare first-order terms in ℤ_p(ζ_p): write ζ_p = 1 + δ with v_p(δ)>0. Then
η_p (1 + k_p δ) + O(δ^2) = ε (1 + i δ) + O(δ^2).
Equating constant terms gives η_p = ε, and equating linear terms in ℤ_p yields k_p = i. Therefore u(ζ_p) = ε ζ_p^i for all p∈P. Since P is infinite and consists of prime orders (prime powers), Theorem 2 (injectivity of τ over such an infinite set) implies u = ε q^i.

Remarks on p-adic truncation (correction and usage)
- Tail vanishing (uniform in the tower): Fix r≥1. For any odd prime p and any a≥1, and any primitive ζ of order p^a, (ζ)_n ≡ 0 (mod p^r) for all sufficiently large n (depending on r) because v_p((ζ)_n)=n·v_p(ζ−1)+v_p(n!) → +∞ as n→∞. This gives useful control of tails when comparing u(ζ) modulo p^r across the p-tower.
- No uniform-in-a bound at fixed n: For fixed small n, v_p((ζ_{p^a})_n) does not admit a uniform-in-a positive lower bound (since v_p(ζ_{p^a}−1)=1/((p−1)p^{a−1}) → 0 as a→∞). Thus truncation claims should be phrased as tail statements in n, not as fixed-n bounds uniform in a.

Consequences and small cases settled
- Laurent-polynomial units are monomials (finite-field reduction proof already established). Immediate corollary: γ_m(q)=∑_{i=0}^{m−1}(−1)^i q^i (odd m≥3) are not units (e.g., γ_m(−1)=m≠±1).
- Prime-level rigidity criterion (direct corollary of Proposition 4): If for infinitely many odd primes p one has u(ζ_p)=ε ζ_p^i (with ε=u(1) and fixed i), then u=ε q^i.
- Coprime-order gluing (Lemma 3): Exact congruences at coprime orders assemble to larger squarefree orders. While not directly producing prime-power orders, this supplies a consistency mechanism for building large sets Z for τ-injectivity once many prime-order congruences are known.

Examples and tests
- Two-term Laurent polynomials aq^r+bq^s (|a|+|b|≥2) fail to be units by evaluation at ±1 unless they are ±q^k.
- If u ∈ U(ℤ[q]^ℕ) and u(ζ_p) is a root of unity for infinitely many primes p (e.g., u(ζ_p) ∈ {±ζ_p^k}), then Proposition 4 applies and u = ± q^i.

Obstacles
- The main remaining gap is to promote p-adic congruences (Lemma 2), which are first-order approximations, to exact equalities u(ζ_{p^a}) = ε ζ_{p^a}^i for infinitely many levels a. The tail control provides modular vanishing but does not by itself force exact values across the tower.

Next steps
- Tower-lifting criterion in ℤ_p(ζ_{p^a}): For v(q)=ε^{−1} q^{−i}u(q), study E_a := v(ζ_{p^a}) ∈ 1+(ζ_{p^a}−1)^2. Seek conditions under which E_a=1 for infinitely many a (e.g., via growth of valuations of E_a−1, or a lifting argument from level p to p^2, etc.). A successful criterion for a single odd p would resolve the conjecture via Theorem 2.
- Exploit Lemma 3: aim to first obtain exact monomial evaluations for infinitely many primes p (level 1), then conclude by Proposition 4.
- Formalize the determinant constraint (Lemma 1) in combination with archimedean or p-adic estimates to rule out “too small” deviations E_a across many nth levels.

Summary of new, auditable progress
- First-order matching lemma (Lemma 2) with a clean p-adic Taylor proof, valid for all odd p and all levels.
- CRT exponent gluing (Lemma 3) for coprime orders.
- Determinant identity (Lemma 1) for every n.
- A nontrivial special case proved (Proposition 4): if u takes root-of-unity values at ζ_p for infinitely many primes p, then u is ± q^i.
These add to the established Laurent-polynomial classification and provide concrete, checkable stepping stones toward the full conjecture.
