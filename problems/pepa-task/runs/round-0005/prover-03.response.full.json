          "text": "{\"content\":\"Ideas\\n- Goal: Conjecture 7.2 (units of the Habiro ring \u2124[q]^\u2115 are exactly {\u00b1q^i}). We consolidate and extend the toolbox with three new, rigorous statements that are immediately testable: (A) a prime-order rigidity lemma (special case of the \u201cinfinitely many prime powers\u201d rigidity, but stated for primes); (B) a canonical exponent (slope) i from the Ohtsuki expansion and its first-order p-adic matching at all towers \u03bc_{p^\u221e} (p odd); (C) a uniform tail-control lemma at p-power roots. These sharpen the route to produce infinitely many exact monomial evaluations needed for the existing rigidity criterion.\\n\\nProposition A (prime-order rigidity)\\nStatement. Let u\u2208U(\u2124[q]^\u2115). If there exist i\u2208\u2124 and an infinite set \u03a0 of odd primes such that for each \u2113\u2208\u03a0 and each primitive \u2113-th root \u03b6 we have u(\u03b6)=\u00b1\u03b6^i, then u=\u00b1q^i in \u2124[q]^\u2115.\\nProof. Let Z be the set of those primitive \u2113-th roots with \u2113\u2208\u03a0. By Theorem (paper\u2019s thm:2), the evaluation map \u03c4^\u2124_{\u2115,Z}: \u2124[q]^\u2115\u2192\u220f_{\u03b6\u2208Z}\u2124[\u03b6] is injective (Z contains infinitely many prime powers\u2014here primes). Hence w(q):=u(q)/(\u00b1q^i) maps to the constant 1 on Z, so w=1. \u220e\\n\\nLemma B (canonical exponent and first-order matching)\\nLet u\u2208U(\u2124[q]^\u2115). Write its Habiro expansion u=\u2211_{n\u22650} a_n(q) (q)_n with a_n\u2208\u2124[q]. Then:\\n(i) u(1)=a_0(1)\u2208{\u00b11} and u\u2032(1)=a_0\u2032(1)\u2212a_1(1). In particular i:=u\u2032(1)/u(1)\u2208\u2124 is well-defined.\\n(ii) Fix an odd prime p and a\u22651, and let \u03b6 be a primitive p^a-th root. In \u2124_p(\u03b6), we have\\nu(\u03b6) \u2261 u(1)\u00b7\u03b6^i mod (\u03b6\u22121)^2.\\nProof. (i) Evaluate at q=1: (q)_0(1)=1, and (q)_n(1)=0 for n\u22651. For derivatives, (q)_1\u2032(1)=\u22121 and (q)_n\u2032(1)=0 for n\u22652, giving the stated formula. Since u(1)=\u00b11, i\u2208\u2124.\\n(ii) In \u2124_p[[X]] with X=q\u22121, write u(1+X)=\u03b5 + \u03b5 i X + X^2 w(X), where \u03b5=u(1)=\u00b11. Substitute X=\u03b6\u22121; for p odd, |\u03b6\u22121|_p<1, so convergence holds and u(\u03b6)\u2261\u03b5+\u03b5 i(\u03b6\u22121) mod (\u03b6\u22121)^2. Also \u03b6^i\u22611+i(\u03b6\u22121) mod (\u03b6\u22121)^2, hence u(\u03b6)\u2261\u03b5\u00b7\u03b6^i mod (\u03b6\u22121)^2. \u220e\\n\\nLemma C (uniform tail control at p-power roots)\\nStatement. Fix an odd prime p and r\u22651. There exists N(r) such that for every a\u22651 and every primitive \u03b6 of order p^a, one has (q)_n(\u03b6)\u22610 mod p^r in \u2124_p(\u03b6) for all n\u2265N(r).\\nProof. For k\u22651 we have v_{\ud835\udd2d}(1\u2212\u03b6^k)=v_{\ud835\udd2d}(1\u2212\u03b6)+v_p(k) (standard for cyclotomic towers). Thus\\nv_{\ud835\udd2d}((q)_n(\u03b6)) = \u2211_{k=1}^n v_{\ud835\udd2d}(1\u2212\u03b6^k) = n v_{\ud835\udd2d}(1\u2212\u03b6)+v_p(n!).\\nSince v_{\ud835\udd2d}(1\u2212\u03b6)=1/(p^{a\u22121}(p\u22121))>0 and v_p(n!)\u2192\u221e with n, the RHS\u2192\u221e with n uniformly in a (because v_p(n!) is independent of a). Hence for any prescribed r there is N(r) so that v_{\ud835\udd2d}((q)_n(\u03b6))\u2265r for every a and n\u2265N(r). \u220e\\nWhy useful. For any u=\u2211 a_n(q) (q)_n, the tail \u2211_{n\u2265N(r)} a_n(\u03b6) (q)_n(\u03b6) is 0 mod p^r uniformly in a; one only needs to analyze finitely many head terms to study u(\u03b6) modulo p^r along \u03bc_{p^\u221e}.\\n\\nExamples\\n- If u=\u00b1q^i, then Lemma B recovers i and \u00b1, and Lemma C is tautologically satisfied. Proposition A applies to any sequence of primes.\\n- Non-monomial Laurent polynomials g\u2208\u2124[q,q^{\u22121}] cannot be Habiro-units (proved earlier): immediately rules out classical candidates like \u03b3_m.\\n\\nObstacles\\n- Lemma B gives only first-order congruence u(\u03b6)\u2261u(1)\u00b7\u03b6^i modulo (\u03b6\u22121)^2 along \u03bc_{p^\u221e}, not exact equality at infinitely many levels. Lemma C controls tails but does not, by itself, force exact equality. A mechanism to promote congruences to equalities (e.g., via p-adic logarithms and a tower-lifting criterion) is still missing.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Local lifting attempt: For the normalized v(q):=u(q)/(u(1) q^i), set E_{p^a}:=v(\u03b6_{p^a})\u22081+(\u03b6\u22121)^2. Study log E_{p^a}\u2208\ud835\udd2d in \u2124_p(\u03b6_{p^a}); aim to prove log E_{p^a}=0 for infinitely many a (then E_{p^a}=1 and Proposition A applies). Lemma C reduces this to finitely many head coefficients modulo p^r.\\n- Two-prime synthesis: Do the previous step for two odd primes p and q to pin down the same i and apply the \u201cinfinite exact match\u201d rigidity (Theorem (thm:2)).\\n- Formalize all statements (Proposition A, Lemma B, Lemma C) in proofs.md with complete proofs. These, together with the previously established Laurent-polynomial classification and torsion-units result, give a coherent, verifiable partial framework toward Conjecture 7.2.\\n\"}",
