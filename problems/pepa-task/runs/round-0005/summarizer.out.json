  "summary_md": "Goal: prove Conjecture 7.2: U(Z[q]^N) = {\u00b1q^i}. Progress this round: torsion units are shown to be \u00b11; Laurent-polynomial candidates are eliminated (any g\u2208Z[q,q^{-1}] that is a Habiro-unit equals \u00b1q^i by a finite-field reduction); p-adic tools (valuations on p-power roots, uniform tail truncation mod p^r) and a canonical exponent i = u'(1)/u(1) give first-order matching u(\u03b6)\u2261\u03b5\u00b7\u03b6^i mod (\u03b6\u22121)^2; rigidity via \u03c4-injectivity yields u=\u00b1q^i when u(\u03b6)=\u00b1\u03b6^i for infinitely many prime-power \u03b6. Main remaining gap: promote p-adic congruences along \u03bc_{p^\u221e} to infinitely many exact equalities u(\u03b6_{p^a})=\u00b1\u03b6_{p^a}^i (tower-lifting). Planned routes: p-adic tower analysis, two-prime synthesis (combine primes and use \u03c4), or obtain infinitely many prime-order exact matches via determinant/CRT methods.
