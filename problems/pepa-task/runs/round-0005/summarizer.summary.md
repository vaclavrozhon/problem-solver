Goal: prove Conjecture 7.2: U(Z[q]^N) = {±q^i}. Progress this round: torsion units are shown to be ±1; Laurent-polynomial candidates are eliminated (any g∈Z[q,q^{-1}] that is a Habiro-unit equals ±q^i by a finite-field reduction); p-adic tools (valuations on p-power roots, uniform tail truncation mod p^r) and a canonical exponent i = u'(1)/u(1) give first-order matching u(ζ)≡ε·ζ^i mod (ζ−1)^2; rigidity via τ-injectivity yields u=±q^i when u(ζ)=±ζ^i for infinitely many prime-power ζ. Main remaining gap: promote p-adic congruences along μ_{p^∞} to infinitely many exact equalities u(ζ_{p^a})=±ζ_{p^a}^i (tower-lifting). Planned routes: p-adic tower analysis, two-prime synthesis (combine primes and use τ), or obtain infinitely many prime-order exact matches via determinant/CRT methods.
