  "feedback_md": "Conjecture 7.2 is confirmed as the Habiro-units statement. This round consolidates rigor across several key components and adds two useful lemmas.\n\nWhat is correct and solid:\n- Laurent-polynomial case: All three proofs are acceptable; prefer the finite-field reduction proof (does not need Schur). Conclusion: \u2124[q,q^{-1}]\u2229U(\u2124[q]^\u2115)={\u00b1q^i}. \u03b3_m (odd m\u22653) are not units (e.g., by evaluation at \u22121).\n- p-adic tools: For p odd, v_p(\u03b6^k\u22121)=v_p(\u03b6\u22121)+v_p(k) (k<p^a), hence v_p((\u03b6)_n)=n v_p(\u03b6\u22121)+v_p(n!). The uniform tail truncation modulo p^r (depending only on r via N(r) with v_p(n!)\u2265r) is correct and should be used precisely as a tail statement (not as a fixed-n bound uniform in a). Good correction noted by Prover 2.\n- Canonical exponent and first-order matching: i=u\u2032(1)/u(1)\u2208\u2124 is well-defined; u(\u03b6)\u2261u(1)\u00b7\u03b6^i mod (\u03b6\u22121)^2 for all odd prime-power \u03b6. This provides a single global i to test against \u00b1q^i.\n- Determinant/product identity \u220f_{\u03b6^n=1}u(\u03b6)=\u00b11 is valid and useful as a global constraint.\n- CRT exponent gluing at coprime orders is correct and handy for assembling congruences.\n- Prime-order rigidity: If u(\u03b6_\u2113)=\u00b1\u03b6_\u2113^i for infinitely many primes \u2113 (or more generally u(\u03b6_\u2113) is a root of unity for infinitely many \u2113, which by first-order matching forces \u00b1\u03b6_\u2113^i), then u=\u00b1q^i by \u03c4-injectivity (Theorem 2).\n\nWhat remains open/blocking:\n- The central missing step is a tower-lifting mechanism: upgrade congruences to exact equalities u(\u03b6_{p^a})=\u00b1\u03b6_{p^a}^i for infinitely many a (for at least one odd p). Proposition E is only sketched; a rigorous proof must formalize stabilization of truncated values across the cyclotomic tower via compatible projection maps.\n\nNext steps:\n- Formalize the lifting criterion along \u03bc_{p^\u221e}. Work with v(q)=u(1)^{\u22121}q^{\u2212i}u(q) and E_a:=v(\u03b6_{p^a})\u22081+(\u03b6\u22121)^2. Use tail-control to reduce to finitely many head terms, and prove a stabilization/compatibility result producing infinitely many a with E_a=1.\n- Alternatively, target exact matches at infinitely many prime orders (level 1) using determinant constraints and CRT gluing; combine with first-order matching to force u(\u03b6_p)=\u00b1\u03b6_p^i for infinitely many primes, then conclude by \u03c4.\n",

    "content": "Lemma (CRT exponent gluing). Let m,n be coprime positive integers and u \u2208 Z[q]^N. Suppose for some \u03b5\u2208{\u00b11} and integers i,j we have u \u2261 \u03b5 q^i (mod \u03a6_m) and u \u2261 \u03b5 q^j (mod \u03a6_n). Then there exists t modulo mn such that u \u2261 \u03b5 q^t (mod \u03a6_m \u03a6_n). In particular, for any primitive \u03b6_{mn} one has u(\u03b6_{mn})=\u03b5 \u03b6_{mn}^t.\nProof. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, Z[q]/(\u03a6_m \u03a6_n) \u2245 Z[q]/(\u03a6_m) \u00d7 Z[q]/(\u03a6_n). The image of u equals (\u03b5 q^i, \u03b5 q^j). Let t solve t\u2261i (mod m), t\u2261j (mod n). Then (\u03b5 q^t, \u03b5 q^t)=(\u03b5 q^i, \u03b5 q^j), so u \u2261 \u03b5 q^t (mod \u03a6_m \u03a6_n). Evaluating at \u03b6_{mn} gives the last statement. \u220e\n\nProposition (prime-order rigidity). Let u\u2208U(Z[q]^N). If there exist i\u2208Z and an infinite set \u03a0 of odd primes such that for each \u2113\u2208\u03a0 and each primitive \u2113th root \u03b6 one has u(\u03b6)=\u00b1\u03b6^i, then u=\u00b1q^i.\nProof. Let Z be the set of those primitive \u2113th roots with \u2113\u2208\u03a0. Since primes are prime powers, Theorem 2 (Habiro) implies \u03c4_{N,Z}: Z[q]^N \u2192 \u220f_{\u03b6\u2208Z} Z[\u03b6] is injective. The element w(q)=u(q)/(\u00b1q^i) evaluates to 1 on Z, so w=1 and u=\u00b1q^i. \u220e\n\nProposition (prime-order root-of-unity values force the same exponent). Let u\u2208U(Z[q]^N), \u03b5:=u(1), and i:=u\u2032(1)/\u03b5. Suppose there exists an infinite set \u03a0 of odd primes such that for each p\u2208\u03a0 and primitive \u03b6_p, u(\u03b6_p) is a root of unity in Q(\u03b6_p). Then u(\u03b6_p)=\u03b5 \u03b6_p^i for all p\u2208\u03a0, hence u=\u03b5 q^i.\nProof. For p\u2208\u03a0 write u(\u03b6_p)=\u03b7_p \u03b6_p^{k_p} with \u03b7_p a root of unity. By the first-order matching u(\u03b6_p) \u2261 \u03b5 \u03b6_p^i (mod (\u03b6_p\u22121)^2) in Z_p(\u03b6_p). Writing \u03b6_p=1+\u03b4 with v_p(\u03b4)>0 and expanding, \u03b7_p(1+k_p \u03b4) \u2261 \u03b5(1+i \u03b4) (mod \u03b4^2). Equalities of constant and linear terms give \u03b7_p=\u03b5 and k_p=i. Thus u(\u03b6_p)=\u03b5 \u03b6_p^i for all p\u2208\u03a0. Apply the previous proposition. \u220e"
