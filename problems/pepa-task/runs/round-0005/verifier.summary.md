We consolidated: (i) Laurent-polynomial units are ±q^i; γ_m non-units; (ii) p-adic valuation/tail truncation along μ_{p^∞}; (iii) canonical exponent i=u′(1)/u(1) and first-order matching u(ζ)≡u(1)·ζ^i mod (ζ−1)^2 (p odd); (iv) determinant identity; (v) CRT exponent gluing; (vi) prime-order rigidity: infinitely many prime-order exact matches imply u=±q^i. The main gap is a tower-lifting argument to get infinitely many exact matches along μ_{p^∞}. Verdict: uncertain.
