{"feedback_md":"Conjecture 7.2 is confirmed as the Habiro-units statement. This round consolidates rigor across several key components and adds two useful lemmas.\n\nWhat is correct and solid:\n- Laurent-polynomial case: All three proofs are acceptable; prefer the finite-field reduction proof (does not need Schur). Conclusion: ℤ[q,q^{-1}]∩U(ℤ[q]^ℕ)={±q^i}. γ_m (odd m≥3) are not units (e.g., by evaluation at −1).\n- p-adic tools: For p odd, v_p(ζ^k−1)=v_p(ζ−1)+v_p(k) (k<p^a), hence v_p((ζ)_n)=n v_p(ζ−1)+v_p(n!). The uniform tail truncation modulo p^r (depending only on r via N(r) with v_p(n!)≥r) is correct and should be used precisely as a tail statement (not as a fixed-n bound uniform in a). Good correction noted by Prover 2.\n- Canonical exponent and first-order matching: i=u′(1)/u(1)∈ℤ is well-defined; u(ζ)≡u(1)·ζ^i mod (ζ−1)^2 for all odd prime-power ζ. This provides a single global i to test against ±q^i.\n- Determinant/product identity ∏_{ζ^n=1}u(ζ)=±1 is valid and useful as a global constraint.\n- CRT exponent gluing at coprime orders is correct and handy for assembling congruences.\n- Prime-order rigidity: If u(ζ_ℓ)=±ζ_ℓ^i for infinitely many primes ℓ (or more generally u(ζ_ℓ) is a root of unity for infinitely many ℓ, which by first-order matching forces ±ζ_ℓ^i), then u=±q^i by τ-injectivity (Theorem 2).\n\nWhat remains open/blocking:\n- The central missing step is a tower-lifting mechanism: upgrade congruences to exact equalities u(ζ_{p^a})=±ζ_{p^a}^i for infinitely many a (for at least one odd p). Proposition E is only sketched; a rigorous proof must formalize stabilization of truncated values across the cyclotomic tower via compatible projection maps.\n\nNext steps:\n- Formalize the lifting criterion along μ_{p^∞}. Work with v(q)=u(1)^{−1}q^{−i}u(q) and E_a:=v(ζ_{p^a})∈1+(ζ−1)^2. Use tail-control to reduce to finitely many head terms, and prove a stabilization/compatibility result producing infinitely many a with E_a=1.\n- Alternatively, target exact matches at infinitely many prime orders (level 1) using determinant constraints and CRT gluing; combine with first-order matching to force u(ζ_p)=±ζ_p^i for infinitely many primes, then conclude by τ.\n","summary_md":"We consolidated: (i) Laurent-polynomial units are ±q^i; γ_m non-units; (ii) p-adic valuation/tail truncation along μ_{p^∞}; (iii) canonical exponent i=u′(1)/u(1) and first-order matching u(ζ)≡u(1)·ζ^i mod (ζ−1)^2 (p odd); (iv) determinant identity; (v) CRT exponent gluing; (vi) prime-order rigidity: infinitely many prime-order exact matches imply u=±q^i.

Let m,n be coprime positive integers and u ∈ Z[q]^N. Suppose for some ε∈{±1} and integers i,j we have u ≡ ε q^i (mod Φ_m) and u ≡ ε q^j (mod Φ_n). Then there exists t modulo mn such that u ≡ ε q^t (mod Φ_m Φ_n). In particular, for any primitive ζ_{mn} one has u(ζ_{mn})=ε ζ_{mn}^t.\nProof. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, Z[q]/(Φ_m Φ_n) ≅ Z[q]/(Φ_m) × Z[q]/(Φ_n). The image of u equals (ε q^i, ε q^j). Let t solve t≡i (mod m), t≡j (mod n). Then (ε q^t, ε q^t)=(ε q^i, ε q^j), so u ≡ ε q^t (mod Φ_m Φ_n). Evaluating at ζ_{mn} gives the last statement. ∎\n\nProposition (prime-order rigidity). Let u∈U(Z[q]^N). If there exist i∈Z and an infinite set Π of odd primes such that for each ℓ∈Π and each primitive ℓth root ζ one has u(ζ)=±ζ^i, then u=±q^i.\nProof. Let Z be the set of those primitive ℓth roots with ℓ∈Π. Since primes are prime powers, Theorem 2 (Habiro) implies τ_{N,Z}: Z[q]^N → ∏_{ζ∈Z} Z[ζ] is injective. The element w(q)=u(q)/(±q^i) evaluates to 1 on Z, so w=1 and u=±q^i. ∎\n\nProposition (prime-order root-of-unity values force the same exponent). Let u∈U(Z[q]^N), ε:=u(1), and i:=u′(1)/ε. Suppose there exists an infinite set Π of odd primes such that for each p∈Π and primitive ζ_p, u(ζ_p) is a root of unity in Q(ζ_p). Then u(ζ_p)=ε ζ_p^i for all p∈Π, hence u=ε q^i.\nProof. For p∈Π write u(ζ_p)=η_p ζ_p^{k_p} with η_p a root of unity. By the first-order matching u(ζ_p) ≡ ε ζ_p^i (mod (ζ_p−1)^2) in Z_p(ζ_p). Writing ζ_p=1+δ with v_p(δ)>0 and expanding, η_p(1+k_p δ) ≡ ε(1+i δ) (mod δ^2). Equalities of constant and linear terms give η_p=ε and k_p=i. Thus u(ζ_p)=ε ζ_p^i for all p∈Π. Apply the previous proposition. ∎"},"output_update":null}
