Experiment with different colorings and compute the probability that two nodes at distance d have the same color. \n    - *How it can fail*: If the coloring is not uniform, the correlations may not hold, leading to incorrect conclusions about the distribution.\n\n- **Prove special cases**: \n  - Attempt to prove that for rings of size n = 11, a quantum algorithm cannot achieve a perfect coloring. Use the framework of experiments described in the literature to derive probabilities. \n    - *How it can fail*: The experimental setup may not capture all possible colorings, leading to an incomplete proof.\n\n- **Investigate bounds**: \n  - Explore the linear programming approach to bounding the success probability of non-signaling distributions. \n    - *How it can fail*: The linear program may be too complex to solve for larger n, limiting the applicability of the results.\n\n- **Identify potential counterexamples**: \n  - Check if there exist distributions that could achieve better bounds than those currently established. \n    - *How it can fail*: If no such distributions exist, the search may yield no new insights, reinforcing the current understanding instead.",
