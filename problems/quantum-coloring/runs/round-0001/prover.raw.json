Experiment with different colorings and compute the probability that two nodes at distance d have the same color. \\n    - *How it can fail*: If the coloring is not uniform, the correlations may not hold, leading to incorrect conclusions about the distribution.\\n\\n- **Prove special cases**: \\n  - Attempt to prove that for rings of size n = 11, a quantum algorithm cannot achieve a perfect coloring. Use the framework of experiments described in the literature to derive probabilities. \\n    - *How it can fail*: The experimental setup may not capture all possible colorings, leading to an incomplete proof.\\n\\n- **Investigate bounds**: \\n  - Explore the linear programming approach to bounding the success probability of non-signaling distributions. \\n    - *How it can fail*: The linear program may be too complex to solve for larger n, limiting the applicability of the results.\\n\\n- **Identify potential counterexamples**: \\n  - Check if there exist distributions that could achieve better bounds than those currently established. \\n    - *How it can fail*: If no such distributions exist, the search may yield no new insights, reinforcing the current understanding instead.\",\n  \"new_files\": [],\n  \"requests_for_more_materials\": [],\n  \"next_actions_for_prover\": []\n}", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756266622, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_560af6e559", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 468, "prompt_tokens": 19501, "total_tokens": 19969, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}
