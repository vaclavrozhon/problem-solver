Ideas and target for this round
- Goal: move beyond the single-round, one-way lower bound of Le Gall–Rosmanis (LGR, 2022) and obtain any nontrivial lower bound for 3-coloring cycles in the quantum LOCAL model with 2 or 3 rounds. A first milestone is to rule out perfect correctness (i.e., prove a constant error lower bound) for fixed small numbers of rounds; a stronger milestone is an exponential decay in n of the success probability.
- We leverage two key abstractions of quantum outputs: bounded-dependence (independence beyond distance r), and non-signaling beyond distance r. In the one-way model without shared entanglement, r rounds imply independence beyond r (LGR Lemma 3). In the standard two-way model, without shared entanglement we can adapt the same proof technique to show independence beyond r (sketch below). With shared entanglement, we retain non-signaling beyond r (Akbari et al. 2024, and earlier Gavoille–Kosowski–Markiewicz 2009).

Deliverable A: Independence beyond r also holds for two-way algorithms without shared entanglement
- Statement (Two-way analogue of LGR Lemma 3). Let Φ be the coloring produced by a standard (two-way) r-round quantum LOCAL algorithm on the ring, assuming no initial shared entanglement and identical initial local states. Then Φ is independent at distances beyond r in the natural undirected sense: for any collection of vertex intervals whose pairwise distance (in the cycle metric) is > r, the random colorings on these intervals are mutually independent.
- Proof sketch. Substitute the directed, gapped sliding frames in LGR Appendix A by symmetric intervals [v−r..v+s−1], and allow messages to flow both directions. Define the reverse-evolved measurement projector exactly as in LGR A.2, but now on symmetric buffers. The operator corresponding to the final measurement on a block is supported entirely on the r-neighborhood of that block after reversing the r communication layers. For disjoint r-buffers, the corresponding projectors act on disjoint tensor factors of the initial product state |0⟩⊗n, hence their joint outcome probabilities factor. This gives independence beyond r for two-way quantum LOCAL algorithms without shared entanglement. (We can formalize this as a lemma mirroring LGR’s Lemma 3; nothing in the Heisenberg-picture argument relies on the one-way directionality beyond where the buffers are placed.)
- Usefulness: With independence beyond r established for two-way/no-entanglement, we can reuse LGR’s block-tensorization Lemma 4 to amplify any constant bound on the success probability on a length-k segment into an exponential-in-n bound on the cycle.

Deliverable B: LP framework for multi-round (general r) line segments
- LGR’s LP (Section 4.2) upper-bounds the maximum success probability on a k-node line segment among distributions that are non-signaling beyond distance r. For one-way single-round they obtained r=1, k=9 with optimum 11/15.
- For our 2- and 3-round targets, we propose to instantiate the same LP for r=2 and r=3, seeking any k with optimum strictly less than 1. This suffices for two distinct scenarios:
  1) No shared entanglement (two-way or one-way): by Deliverable A we actually have independence beyond r, which is included in non-signaling; hence sup_indep ≤ sup_non-signaling < 1. Then by LGR Lemma 4 we get an exponential bound (q⌊n/(k+r)⌋).
  2) With shared entanglement: we still obtain that the success probability on a single length-k segment is < 1 for any non-signaling distribution; this certifies at least a constant error on rings whose geometry allows embedding that segment as a necessary condition. (Amplification to exponential in n is delicate without independence; we outline a route below.)
- We write down the r-parameterized LP for the line segment [[1..k]] exactly as in LGR (Eq. (2)), with “gap-r placements that respect the segment” and the non-signaling equality of marginals across placements. This LP size grows with k and r via the number of placements; we propose reductions:
  - Color symmetry: quotient by the action of S3 on colors to shrink variables.
  - Translation symmetry on the segment: use that the LP constraints are invariant under shifting all frames by an offset that keeps them in the segment.
  - Restrict to a generating set of collections F (small t, e.g., t≤3 or 4) that we conjecture already enforces all non-signaling constraints; in r=1, LGR used all collections but observed that small-t constraints were very effective.
- Computational plan: implement the constraint generator and solve the LP numerically (and potentially symbolically for small k) for r=2 with k ranging from 9 to ~18, and then for r=3 with k up to ~20. The first k where the optimum drops below 1 gives the constant q. (This mirrors LGR’s successful r=1, k=9 case.)

Deliverable C: From line-segment bound to exponential decay (no entanglement)
- If we obtain any k with LP optimum q(r,k) < 1 for r=2 or r=3, Deliverable A allows us to invoke the independence (two-way/no-entanglement). Then LGR’s Lemma 4 applies verbatim, yielding success ≤ q⌊n/(k+r)⌋ for cycles. This provides the requested 2- or 3-round exponential lower bound in the quantum LOCAL model (without shared state), improving the state of the art beyond single-round one-way.

Deliverable D: Constant error lower bounds with shared entanglement (non-signaling only)
- Even without independence, the LP optimum <1 for a suitable k immediately implies that any r-round non-signaling strategy on sufficiently large cycles must fail with probability at least ε>0, via a “necessary local witness” argument: partition the cycle into Ω(n/k) windows of length k separated by gaps of size r; if any window is internally improper, the whole coloring is improper. While we cannot multiply probabilities without independence, we can still conclude that the global success probability is ≤1−ε for infinitely many n by the union bound’s converse: If success were 1, then all windows would be proper with probability 1, contradicting the LP.
- We will formalize this via a covering argument that selects a set of O(n/k) disjoint windows; non-signaling ensures each window has success ≤ q<1, hence the global success probability is ≤ 1−c for some c depending on q and the window packing density. (We do not claim exponential decay in this setting.)

Why experiments-in-distance do not directly extend to two-way multi-round
- LGR’s Section B “bias” method relies on one-way non-signaling beyond 1, which enforces that the pair distribution of colors for two non-adjacent nodes is independent of their mutual distance. In the two-way model, the t-view of a pair at distance d includes the gap length, so φ-LOCAL/non-signaling does not collapse pair distributions for different d. Therefore, we focus on the line-segment LP route for r=2,3.

Obstacles and barriers
- The barrier of Akbari et al. (2024): non-signaling alone cannot separate O(1) from O(log* n) for many LCLs; indeed, they show constant-locality finitely dependent distributions for all O(log* n) LOCAL problems, including 3-coloring on cycles. Our plan sidesteps this by targeting fixed small round numbers (r=2,3) and proving strictly sub-unit success for line segments via LP – exactly the kind of finite-radius obstruction that their barrier does not rule out.
- Computational feasibility: The LP grows quickly with r and k. We mitigate using symmetry reductions and by exploring small k; the r=1 case succeeded already at k=9; for r=2 we expect feasible bounds appear at k in the low teens.

Concrete next steps (auditable)
1) Formal lemma write-up: Two-way/no-entanglement implies independence beyond r (as in Deliverable A). We will produce a concise, checkable proof with the symmetric buffer operator construction; this will be reusable beyond rings.
2) LP implementation for r=2: Generate constraints for k∈{10,…,16}, apply color and translation symmetries, and solve numerically to locate the first k with optimum <1. Verify robustness by increasing the family of frame collections F. Target outcome: a certificate (primal and dual) for some (r,k) with e.g. q≤0.99.
3) If step 2 succeeds, apply Lemma 4 (independence) to yield an explicit exponential lower bound in 2 rounds for two-way, no entanglement; record base and block size.
4) In parallel, attempt r=3 with smaller k (≤14) to see if a similar bound appears.
5) For the shared-entanglement case, formalize the window-covering argument to deduce a constant error lower bound from any line-segment q<1.

Notes on output.md
- No output.md was provided; hence we cannot cross-check or point out gaps in an existing curated proof document. We will ensure that the lemmas we propose (two-way independence beyond r; line-segment LP for r=2,3) are stated precisely and accompanied by self-contained proofs or computational certificates in subsequent rounds.
