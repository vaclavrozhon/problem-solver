## Round 0001 — 2025-08-27T05:50:21.147691Z
- **Extract key lemmas from literature**: 
  - **Lemma 1**: The probability of any quantum single-round one-way distributed algorithm to output a proper 3-coloring is exponentially small in n; specifically, it is at most (11/15)⌊n/10⌋. 
    - *Why useful*: This provides a foundational lower bound for quantum distributed algorithms in the context of 3-coloring a ring.
  - **Lemma 2**: Uniform distribution over proper colorings exhibits long-range correlations, making it non-local. 
    - *Why useful*: This insight can be leveraged to argue against the effectiveness of certain random colorings in quantum settings.

- **Explore small examples**: 
  - Consider a small ring of 11 nodes. Experiment with different colorings and compute the probability that two nodes at distance d have the same color. 
    - *How it can fail*: If the coloring is not uniform, the correlations may not hold, leading to incorrect conclusions about the distribution.

- **Prove special cases**: 
  - Attempt to prove that for rings of size n = 11, a quantum algorithm cannot achieve a perfect coloring. Use the framework of experiments described in the literature to derive probabilities. 
    - *How it can fail*: The experimental setup may not capture all possible colorings, leading to an incomplete proof.

- **Investigate bounds**: 
  - Explore the linear programming approach to bounding the success probability of non-signaling distributions. 
    - *How it can fail*: The linear program may be too complex to solve for larger n, limiting the applicability of the results.

- **Identify potential counterexamples**: 
  - Check if there exist distributions that could achieve better bounds than those currently established. 
    - *How it can fail*: If no such distributions exist, the search may yield no new insights, reinforcing the current understanding instead.

=== Verifier (summary_md) ===
• Lemma 1 lacks a clear derivation or reference for the exponential bound on quantum algorithms.
• Lemma 2 does not specify how long-range correlations are quantified.
• The exploration of small examples needs justification for covering all colorings.
• The linear programming approach is promising but lacks clarity on complexity management.
• The search for counterexamples needs a more robust justification.
