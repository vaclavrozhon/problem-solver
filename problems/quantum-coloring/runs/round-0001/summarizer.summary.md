In this round, key lemmas were extracted regarding quantum distributed algorithms and their limitations in achieving proper 3-colorings in a ring. Lemma 1 establishes an exponential upper bound on the success probability of such algorithms, while Lemma 2 highlights the non-local nature of uniform distributions over proper colorings. Small examples were explored to understand the correlation between node colorings, and attempts were made to prove that a quantum algorithm cannot achieve perfect coloring for a ring of size 11. The round also investigated bounds using linear programming and sought potential counterexamples to existing results. However, several areas require further clarification and justification.
