This round set a concrete plan to prove nontrivial lower bounds for 3-coloring cycles in the r-round quantum LOCAL model for r=2,3. Key technical claim: two-way r-round algorithms without initial shared entanglement satisfy an "independence beyond r" property (two-way analogue of LGR Lemma 3) via a symmetric-buffer Heisenberg-picture argument. The team will generalize LGR's line-segment LP (Sec. 4.2) to parameter r and search numerically for a segment length k with LP optimum q(r,k)<1, using S3 color and translation symmetries and smaller generating families of frame-collections to reduce size. If q<1 then (A) without entanglement independence + LGR Lemma 4 gives exponential-in-n decay; (B) with entanglement non-signaling gives a constant-error lower bound via a window-covering argument. Main obstacles: Akbari et al. (2024) barrier and LP growth with r,k. Concrete next steps: formalize the independence lemma, implement the r=2 LP for k≈10–16 and produce primal/dual certificates, then extend to r=3 as feasible. Verifier: success.
