  "feedback_md": "The prover's latest round presents a series of claims and explorations regarding lower bounds for quantum distributed algorithms in the context of 3-coloring a ring. However, there are several issues that need to be addressed for rigor and clarity. Firstly, while Lemma 1 claims an exponential bound on the success probability of quantum algorithms, it lacks a clear derivation or reference to the foundational work that supports this assertion. The statement about the uniform distribution in Lemma 2 is also vague; it does not specify how these long-range correlations are quantified or their implications on the coloring process. The exploration of small examples, particularly the case of an 11-node ring, is a good approach, but it does not sufficiently justify how the experimental setup will cover all possible colorings. The investigation into linear programming approaches is promising, yet it is unclear how the complexity of these programs will be managed for larger n. Lastly, the identification of potential counterexamples is crucial, but the claim that no new distributions exist needs a more robust justification. Overall, the claims made are interesting but require more rigorous backing and clearer definitions to be considered valid contributions.",
