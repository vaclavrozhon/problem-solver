--- SYSTEM ---
You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md and output.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers
- notes.md (summary so far)
- output.md (rigorously proven results so far)

Guidelines:
- notes.md: should be a readable running log of interesting work. Prefer appending. Replace only if old notes are clearly misleading. Remember -- notes should be self-contained and should make sense even without seeing outputs of past provers. 
- output.md: should be concise and rigorous. It should contain only fully proven theorems that are clearly an interesting step towards the solution (or the solution itself). The beginning of the file is a clear list of interesting theorems you can prove. From the statement of the theorem it has to be clear that this constitutes nontrivial progress towards solution. The rest of the file contains a fully rigorous list of the proofs of the theorems. Keep only proven theorems with clear proofs. If a statement is flawed and you cannot fix it, remove it from output.md and instead add it to notes.md with explanation.
- Be careful with the booleans `new_notes_append` and `new_outputs_append`: default is True (append). Use False only when deliberately rewriting everything.

Tasks:
1) Audit rigor: identify unjustified steps, false statements, missing lemmas; produce minimal counterexamples.
2) Triage value: separate genuine progress from noise.
3) Guide next steps: propose what provers should try next.

[{"prover_id": "01", "progress_md": "Ideas and target for this round\n- Goal: move beyond the single-round, one-way lower bound of Le Gall\u2013Rosmanis (LGR, 2022) and obtain any nontrivial lower bound for 3-coloring cycles in the quantum LOCAL model with 2 or 3 rounds. A first milestone is to rule out perfect correctness (i.e., prove a constant error lower bound) for fixed small numbers of rounds; a stronger milestone is an exponential decay in n of the success probability.\n- We leverage two key abstractions of quantum outputs: bounded-dependence (independence beyond distance r), and non-signaling beyond distance r. In the one-way model without shared entanglement, r rounds imply independence beyond r (LGR Lemma 3). In the standard two-way model, without shared entanglement we can adapt the same proof technique to show independence beyond r (sketch below). With shared entanglement, we retain non-signaling beyond r (Akbari et al. 2024, and earlier Gavoille\u2013Kosowski\u2013Markiewicz 2009).\n\nDeliverable A: Independence beyond r also holds for two-way algorithms without shared entanglement\n- Statement (Two-way analogue of LGR Lemma 3). Let \u03a6 be the coloring produced by a standard (two-way) r-round quantum LOCAL algorithm on the ring, assuming no initial shared entanglement and identical initial local states. Then \u03a6 is independent at distances beyond r in the natural undirected sense: for any collection of vertex intervals whose pairwise distance (in the cycle metric) is > r, the random colorings on these intervals are mutually independent.\n- Proof sketch. Substitute the directed, gapped sliding frames in LGR Appendix A by symmetric intervals [v\u2212r..v+s\u22121], and allow messages to flow both directions. Define the reverse-evolved measurement projector exactly as in LGR A.2, but now on symmetric buffers. The operator corresponding to the final measurement on a block is supported entirely on the r-neighborhood of that block after reversing the r communication layers. For disjoint r-buffers, the corresponding projectors act on disjoint tensor factors of the initial product state |0\u27e9\u2297n, hence their joint outcome probabilities factor. This gives independence beyond r for two-way quantum LOCAL algorithms without shared entanglement. (We can formalize this as a lemma mirroring LGR\u2019s Lemma 3; nothing in the Heisenberg-picture argument relies on the one-way directionality beyond where the buffers are placed.)\n- Usefulness: With independence beyond r established for two-way/no-entanglement, we can reuse LGR\u2019s block-tensorization Lemma 4 to amplify any constant bound on the success probability on a length-k segment into an exponential-in-n bound on the cycle.\n\nDeliverable B: LP framework for multi-round (general r) line segments\n- LGR\u2019s LP (Section 4.2) upper-bounds the maximum success probability on a k-node line segment among distributions that are non-signaling beyond distance r. For one-way single-round they obtained r=1, k=9 with optimum 11/15.\n- For our 2- and 3-round targets, we propose to instantiate the same LP for r=2 and r=3, seeking any k with optimum strictly less than 1. This suffices for two distinct scenarios:\n  1) No shared entanglement (two-way or one-way): by Deliverable A we actually have independence beyond r, which is included in non-signaling; hence sup_indep \u2264 sup_non-signaling < 1. Then by LGR Lemma 4 we get an exponential bound (q\u230an/(k+r)\u230b).\n  2) With shared entanglement: we still obtain that the success probability on a single length-k segment is < 1 for any non-signaling distribution; this certifies at least a constant error on rings whose geometry allows embedding that segment as a necessary condition. (Amplification to exponential in n is delicate without independence; we outline a route below.)\n- We write down the r-parameterized LP for the line segment [[1..k]] exactly as in LGR (Eq. (2)), with \u201cgap-r placements that respect the segment\u201d and the non-signaling equality of marginals across placements. This LP size grows with k and r via the number of placements; we propose reductions:\n  - Color symmetry: quotient by the action of S3 on colors to shrink variables.\n  - Translation symmetry on the segment: use that the LP constraints are invariant under shifting all frames by an offset that keeps them in the segment.\n  - Restrict to a generating set of collections F (small t, e.g., t\u22643 or 4) that we conjecture already enforces all non-signaling constraints; in r=1, LGR used all collections but observed that small-t constraints were very effective.\n- Computational plan: implement the constraint generator and solve the LP numerically (and potentially symbolically for small k) for r=2 with k ranging from 9 to ~18, and then for r=3 with k up to ~20. The first k where the optimum drops below 1 gives the constant q. (This mirrors LGR\u2019s successful r=1, k=9 case.)\n\nDeliverable C: From line-segment bound to exponential decay (no entanglement)\n- If we obtain any k with LP optimum q(r,k) < 1 for r=2 or r=3, Deliverable A allows us to invoke the independence (two-way/no-entanglement). Then LGR\u2019s Lemma 4 applies verbatim, yielding success \u2264 q\u230an/(k+r)\u230b for cycles. This provides the requested 2- or 3-round exponential lower bound in the quantum LOCAL model (without shared state), improving the state of the art beyond single-round one-way.\n\nDeliverable D: Constant error lower bounds with shared entanglement (non-signaling only)\n- Even without independence, the LP optimum <1 for a suitable k immediately implies that any r-round non-signaling strategy on sufficiently large cycles must fail with probability at least \u03b5>0, via a \u201cnecessary local witness\u201d argument: partition the cycle into \u2126(n/k) windows of length k separated by gaps of size r; if any window is internally improper, the whole coloring is improper. While we cannot multiply probabilities without independence, we can still conclude that the global success probability is \u22641\u2212\u03b5 for infinitely many n by the union bound\u2019s converse: If success were 1, then all windows would be proper with probability 1, contradicting the LP.\n- We will formalize this via a covering argument that selects a set of O(n/k) disjoint windows; non-signaling ensures each window has success \u2264 q<1, hence the global success probability is \u2264 1\u2212c for some c depending on q and the window packing density. (We do not claim exponential decay in this setting.)\n\nWhy experiments-in-distance do not directly extend to two-way multi-round\n- LGR\u2019s Section B \u201cbias\u201d method relies on one-way non-signaling beyond 1, which enforces that the pair distribution of colors for two non-adjacent nodes is independent of their mutual distance. In the two-way model, the t-view of a pair at distance d includes the gap length, so \u03c6-LOCAL/non-signaling does not collapse pair distributions for different d. Therefore, we focus on the line-segment LP route for r=2,3.\n\nObstacles and barriers\n- The barrier of Akbari et al. (2024): non-signaling alone cannot separate O(1) from O(log* n) for many LCLs; indeed, they show constant-locality finitely dependent distributions for all O(log* n) LOCAL problems, including 3-coloring on cycles. Our plan sidesteps this by targeting fixed small round numbers (r=2,3) and proving strictly sub-unit success for line segments via LP \u2013 exactly the kind of finite-radius obstruction that their barrier does not rule out.\n- Computational feasibility: The LP grows quickly with r and k. We mitigate using symmetry reductions and by exploring small k; the r=1 case succeeded already at k=9; for r=2 we expect feasible bounds appear at k in the low teens.\n\nConcrete next steps (auditable)\n1) Formal lemma write-up: Two-way/no-entanglement implies independence beyond r (as in Deliverable A). We will produce a concise, checkable proof with the symmetric buffer operator construction; this will be reusable beyond rings.\n2) LP implementation for r=2: Generate constraints for k\u2208{10,\u2026,16}, apply color and translation symmetries, and solve numerically to locate the first k with optimum <1. Verify robustness by increasing the family of frame collections F. Target outcome: a certificate (primal and dual) for some (r,k) with e.g. q\u22640.99.\n3) If step 2 succeeds, apply Lemma 4 (independence) to yield an explicit exponential lower bound in 2 rounds for two-way, no entanglement; record base and block size.\n4) In parallel, attempt r=3 with smaller k (\u226414) to see if a similar bound appears.\n5) For the shared-entanglement case, formalize the window-covering argument to deduce a constant error lower bound from any line-segment q<1.\n\nNotes on output.md\n- No output.md was provided; hence we cannot cross-check or point out gaps in an existing curated proof document. We will ensure that the lemmas we propose (two-way independence beyond r; line-segment LP for r=2,3) are stated precisely and accompanied by self-contained proofs or computational certificates in subsequent rounds."}]
