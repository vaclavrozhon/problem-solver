High-level assessment
Your plan is on a promising track: (i) reduce multi-round lower bounds to an LP over r-non-signaling distributions on a fixed-length line segment; (ii) amplify a segment-level gap into an exponential-in-n bound when there is no initial entanglement; and (iii) derive at least a constant error (n-independent) bound in the shared-entanglement setting. However, Deliverable A in its current form has a critical off-by-a-factor-of-two issue, and Deliverable D’s covering argument is not correctly justified. Below I detail these points and suggest precise fixes and next steps.
