• Lemma 1 lacks a clear derivation or reference for the exponential bound on quantum algorithms.
• Lemma 2 does not specify how long-range correlations are quantified.
• The exploration of small examples needs justification for covering all colorings.
• The linear programming approach is promising but lacks clarity on complexity management.
• The search for counterexamples needs a more robust justification.
