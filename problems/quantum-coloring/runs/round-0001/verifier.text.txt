{"feedback_md":"High-level assessment\nYour plan is on a promising track: (i) reduce multi-round lower bounds to an LP over r-non-signaling distributions on a fixed-length line segment; (ii) amplify a segment-level gap into an exponential-in-n bound when there is no initial entanglement; and (iii) derive at least a constant error (n-independent) bound in the shared-entanglement setting. However, Deliverable A in its current form has a critical off-by-a-factor-of-two issue, and Deliverable D’s covering argument is not correctly justified. Below I detail these points and suggest precise fixes and next steps.\n\nSpecific correctness issues and fixes\n1) Independence beyond r (two-way, no entanglement): the statement as written is false. In two-way r-round circuits, a measurement localized to a block spreads to its radius-r neighborhood when you reverse the circuit. To obtain independence, these supports must be disjoint. For two disjoint blocks, this requires the distance between the blocks to exceed 2r, not r. Minimal counterexample (r=1): three nodes in a path 0–1–2; node 1 samples a private bit b and sends it to both neighbors in one round; nodes 0 and 2 output b. The outputs at distance 2 are perfectly correlated, so “independence beyond 1” fails. The corrected statement is: independence holds for collections of blocks whose r-neighborhoods are pairwise disjoint (equivalently, whose pairwise distances exceed 2r). The Heisenberg-picture proof you sketch then goes through rigorously. This correction propagates to the amplification step: the packing becomes roughly ⌊n/(k+2r)⌋ rather than ⌊n/(k+r)⌋.\n\n2) Non-signaling beyond r with shared entanglement: your summary is correct. One can formalize via the Heisenberg-picture localization of effects: the output marginal on a region S depends only on the initial state on N_r(S). This holds regardless of initial entanglement.\n\n3) LP framework (Deliverable B): the plan to instantiate LGR’s LP for r=2,3 is sensible. Using color symmetry (S3), translation symmetry, and possibly reflection will substantially shrink the LP. Restricting to a generating family of frame-collections is safe as a relaxation: since you maximize success, dropping constraints can only increase the optimum; if the relaxed optimum is already < 1, the true optimum is also < 1. For the final certificate, do include all needed placements to ensure a fully rigorous bound.\n\n4) From segment bound to exponential decay (Deliverable C): with the corrected independence threshold (2r), block-tensorization works: partition the cycle into disjoint windows of length k separated by gaps of size 2r, use independence to multiply the window-success probabilities, and use that global success implies all windows are proper. The exponent is m = ⌊n/(k+2r)⌋.\n\n5) Constant-error with shared entanglement (Deliverable D): the “packing density”/union-bound style argument is not needed and, as stated, is misleading. Without independence, the best general bound is the trivial but sharp one: for any fixed window W of length k, P[whole cycle proper] ≤ P[W proper] ≤ q, where q is the LP optimum for length-k segments under r-non-signaling constraints. This yields an n-independent upper bound q < 1 directly; no packing is required (and packing cannot improve q without independence). The only thing to check is that the window-induced distributions satisfy the LP’s non-signaling constraints; they do, provided placements keep their r-buffers within the window.\n\nValue triage\n- Solid, reusable progress: the corrected “independence beyond 2r” lemma (no entanglement), and the general “localization/non-signaling” lemma. These underpin the entire reduction.\n- Promising direction: implement and solve the r=2 LP for moderate k (≈10–16) with symmetry reductions; if any k yields optimum q < 1, you immediately get (i) a constant-error lower bound with entanglement and (ii) an exponential bound without entanglement with exponent base q and stride k+2r.\n- De-emphasize: distance-experiment techniques from LGR Appendix B. As you note, they hinge on one-way asymmetry and do not cleanly transfer to two-way.\n\nConcrete next steps (actionable)\n1) Formalize and write complete proofs of two lemmas now added to output.md: (i) light-cone localization and non-signaling beyond r, and (ii) independence beyond 2r for product initial states (no shared entanglement). These are standard and we provide clean proofs below.\n2) Update all references to “> r” separation to “> 2r” where independence is invoked. Recompute the packing factor m = ⌊n/(k+2r)⌋ in the amplification statement.\n3) LP implementation for r=2:\n   - Define variables for distributions over colorings of r-gapped placements inside [1..k].\n   - Enforce non-signaling equalities on overlapping cores across placements that respect the segment (buffers inside [1..k]).\n   - Objective: maximize probability that [1..k] is properly 3-colored.\n   - Apply symmetry reductions: S3 on colors; translations (and reflections if you include both orientations). Verify by orbit enumeration.\n   - Solve for k ∈ {10,…,16}. If any optimum < 1, extract a dual certificate and archive it.\n4) If r=2 succeeds, immediately instantiate the exponential bound without entanglement with stride k+4. In parallel, attempt r=3 with k up to ≈14.\n5) For the entanglement-allowed model, record the direct constant bound P[success on C_n] ≤ q for all n ≥ k, with a short formal justification (added below).\n6) Optional: provide a minimal counterexample (as above) documenting the failure of “> r” independence in two-way settings to prevent regression.\n","new_notes_md":"Scope and goal\nWe seek lower bounds for 2–3 round quantum LOCAL algorithms that 3-color an n-cycle. We separate two resource regimes: (i) no initial shared entanglement (initial product state across vertices), and (ii) arbitrary initial shared entanglement. Our strategy follows and extends Le Gall–Rosmanis (LGR, 2022): reduce to a line-segment optimization under r-local non-signaling constraints, then lift to cycles. Two technical pillars are (A) light-cone localization of measurements in r rounds (implying r-non-signaling), and (B) independence across well-separated regions when the initial state is a product.\n\nKey corrections/new facts\n- Independence threshold is 2r, not r, in the two-way model without entanglement. After reversing r communication layers, any measurement on a block depends only on the block’s r-neighborhood. Thus independence of multiple blocks requires their r-neighborhoods to be disjoint, i.e., pairwise distances > 2r. Counterexample to “> r” for r = 1: on a path 0–1–2, one round suffices for node 1 to broadcast a private random bit to nodes 0 and 2, correlating their outputs at distance 2.\n- Non-signaling beyond r holds with or without shared entanglement: the marginal on a set S depends only on the initial state on N_r(S). This follows from Heisenberg-picture localization of effects under depth-r local circuits/channels.\n\nAmplification templates\n- No entanglement (product initial state): If there exists k and q < 1 such that every r-non-signaling distribution on a length-k segment makes the segment proper with probability at most q, then on cycles C_n the success probability is at most q^{⌊n/(k+2r)⌋}. Partition C_n into ⌊n/(k+2r)⌋ disjoint windows of length k separated by gaps of size 2r; window events are independent by the 2r-separation lemma; ring proper implies all windows are proper.\n- With entanglement allowed: For any fixed window W of length k, ring proper implies W is proper. The distribution on W (restricted to placements with r-buffers inside W) is feasible for the r-non-signaling LP, hence P[ring proper] ≤ P[W proper] ≤ q. There is no improvement from packing without independence; the optimal general bound is the n-independent constant q.\n\nLP plan for r = 2, 3\n- Variables: probabilities over colorings on r-gapped placements (collections of frames) inside [1..k]. Placements include cores and r-buffers fully contained in [1..k].\n- Constraints: non-signaling equalities enforcing that the marginal distribution on a given core is independent of the surrounding placement context as long as r-buffers are intact (equalities of marginals across placements that agree on the core).\n- Objective: maximize P[all k − 1 edges inside [1..k] are properly 3-colored].\n- Symmetries: quotient by S3 color permutations; translations (and reflections, if used). It is safe (as a relaxation) to enforce only a generating set of non-signaling constraints; for the final certificate, include all placements that respect the segment.\n- Execution: sweep k ≈ 10–16 for r = 2 (then smaller k for r = 3), solve numerically, and extract dual certificates for any instance with optimum < 1.\n\nWhat remains to be computed\n- A concrete (r, k, q) with q < 1 via the LP. Once obtained, immediately plug into the amplification templates above. Note the stride is k + 2r (not k + r) in the independence-based exponential bound.\n\nReference counterexample (to avoid regression)\n- Two-way, r = 1, no entanglement: path 0–1–2. Node 1 samples b ∈ {0,1}, sends b to 0 and 2, both output b. Outputs at distance 2 are perfectly correlated; independence beyond r = 1 fails. Independence holds only when r-neighborhoods are disjoint (distance > 2r).\n","new_notes_append":"True","new_outputs_md":"Main theorems proved in this file\n- Light-cone localization and r-non-signaling for r-round LOCAL algorithms (with or without initial entanglement).\n- Independence beyond 2r for two-way r-round LOCAL algorithms with product initial states (no shared entanglement).\n- Amplification lemmas: (i) exponential decay in n without entanglement given a segment-level r-non-signaling bound q < 1; (ii) constant error bound with entanglement given the same segment-level bound.\n\nPreliminaries\nLet G = (V, E) be a graph (here, cycles are of primary interest). An r-round quantum LOCAL algorithm consists of r synchronous layers of local channels acting on vertex and edge registers, followed by local measurements at the vertices that output colors in {1,2,3}. We model each round as a product of completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) maps localized on vertices and edges (purifiable to local unitaries by Stinespring dilation). For S ⊆ V, let N_r(S) = {v ∈ V : dist(v, S) ≤ r} denote the r-neighborhood of S.\n\nTheorem 1 (Light-cone localization and r-non-signaling)\nFix an r-round quantum LOCAL algorithm as above. Let S ⊆ V, and let M_S be any POVM element that depends only on the final local measurements in S (e.g., the indicator of a specified color pattern on S). Then there exists a positive operator X_S supported only on the registers associated with N_r(S) (and local ancillas therein) such that, for every initial global state ρ (possibly entangled), the probability of the event M_S is Tr[ρ X_S]. Consequently, if two initial states ρ and ρ′ agree on N_r(S) (i.e., have identical reduced density matrices on N_r(S)), then the output marginal on S is the same under ρ and ρ′. In particular, the output on S is non-signaling with respect to changes outside N_r(S).\n\nProof sketch (fully rigorous upon standard dilation): Purify the algorithm to a depth-r circuit of local unitaries by introducing vertex-local ancillas. In the Heisenberg picture, conjugating M_S backward through each round enlarges its support by at most one graph hop (only gates that touch the current support can change it). After r rounds, the Heisenberg-evolved effect X_S is supported on N_r(S). For any initial state ρ, P[M_S] = Tr[ρ X_S]. If ρ and ρ′ coincide on N_r(S), then Tr[ρ X_S] = Tr[ρ′ X_S], proving r-non-signaling.\n\nTheorem 2 (Independence beyond 2r without initial entanglement)\nAssume the initial state is a product state across vertices (no shared entanglement or shared randomness). Let S_1, …, S_m ⊆ V be subsets whose r-neighborhoods N_r(S_i) are pairwise disjoint (equivalently, dist(S_i, S_j) > 2r for i ≠ j). For each i, let M_{S_i} be any event depending only on the final measurements in S_i, and let X_{S_i} be its Heisenberg-evolved effect from Theorem 1. Then the random outcomes on the sets S_1, …, S_m are mutually independent; in particular,\nTr[ρ X_{S_1} ⋯ X_{S_m}] = ∏_{i=1}^m Tr[ρ_{N_r(S_i)} X_{S_i}],\nso the joint distribution factors. This applies to the events “S_i is properly 3-colored internally,” etc.\n\nProof: By Theorem 1, each X_{S_i} acts only on the registers in N_r(S_i). By hypothesis, these supports are disjoint, and ρ = ⊗_v ρ_v factorizes across the partition of V induced by the disjoint supports. Therefore, the trace of the product factors as claimed, which is precisely independence of the outcomes on S_1, …, S_m.\n\nCorollary 3 (Exponential amplification without entanglement)\nLet r ≥ 1. Fix k ≥ 1 and suppose there exists q < 1 such that, for every r-non-signaling distribution on a length-k path segment, the probability that the segment is properly 3-colored is at most q. Then, for any r-round two-way quantum LOCAL algorithm on the n-cycle with product initial state (no shared entanglement), the success probability satisfies\nP_success(C_n) ≤ q^{⌊n / (k + 2r)⌋}.\n\nProof: Partition the cycle into m = ⌊n / (k + 2r)⌋ disjoint windows W_1, …, W_m of length k separated by gaps of size 2r. If the entire cycle is properly 3-colored, then each window W_i is internally proper. For each i, let E_i be the event “W_i is internally proper,” and X_i its Heisenberg-evolved effect. Each X_i is supported on N_r(W_i), and these supports are disjoint by construction, so the events E_i are independent by Theorem 2. By the hypothesis on the segment-level bound, P[E_i] ≤ q for each i, hence P_success(C_n) ≤ P[⋂_i E_i] = ∏_i P[E_i] ≤ q^m.\n\nCorollary 4 (Constant-error bound with shared entanglement)\nLet r, k, q be as in Corollary 3. For any r-round two-way quantum LOCAL algorithm on the n-cycle (allowing arbitrary shared entanglement), the success probability obeys\nP_success(C_n) ≤ q for all n ≥ k.\n\nProof: Fix any length-k contiguous window W ⊆ C_n. If the entire cycle is properly 3-colored, then W is internally proper. Let E be the event “W is internally proper.” By Theorem 1, the distribution on W (for placements whose r-buffers lie within W) is r-non-signaling with respect to changes outside W. By the definition of q, P[E] ≤ q. Since {cycle proper} ⊆ {E}, we have P_success(C_n) ≤ P[E] ≤ q.\n\nRemark on the tightness of independence: The threshold 2r is necessary in general. For r = 1 on a path 0–1–2, one round suffices for node 1 to correlate nodes 0 and 2 (e.g., by broadcasting a private random bit), so outputs at distance 2 need not be independent.\n","new_outputs_append":"True","verdict":"success"}
