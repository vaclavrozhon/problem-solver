  "progress_md": "Ideas and clarifications added this round\n- We fixed the separation threshold (now correctly 2r) in the independence lemma and propagated it to the amplification stride (k + 2r). This matches the counterexample on a 3-node path for r = 1.\n- We isolated a \u201cplacement invariance\u201d principle for interior frames on a line segment: for any r-round algorithm with identical initial local states and uniform local channels, the marginal distribution over the cores of any r-gapped placement that lies fully r-buffered inside the segment is the same for all placements of the same frame family F (same core lengths, same t). This is the mechanism that justifies the LP constraints equating marginals across placements; it relies on light-cone localization and on the fact that all such placements induce isomorphic r-neighborhoods with identical initial reduced states. We will add this explicitly to output.md.\n\nLP for r-non-signaling on a line segment (precise formulation)\n- Domain: \u03a3 = {1,2,3}. Fix r \u2265 1 and k \u2265 1. Let [k] := {1,\u2026,k}. For a \u201cfamily\u201d F = ({{s1}},\u2026,{{st}}) of sliding frames (each {{sj}} a length-sj contiguous core), a gap-r placement \u03c9 of F is a t-tuple of start indices (\u03c91,\u2026,\u03c9t) such that the r-buffers [[\u03c9j \u2212 r .. \u03c9j + sj \u2212 1 + r]] are all subsets of [1..k] and pairwise disjoint. The induced cores are Cj = [[\u03c9j .. \u03c9j + sj \u2212 1]].\n- Variables: p\u03c8 for each \u03c8 \u2208 \u03a3^k, with p\u03c8 \u2265 0 and \u03a3\u03c8 p\u03c8 = 1.\n- Objective: maximize \u03a3\u03c8 p\u03c8 \u00b7 1{\u03c8 is proper on [1..k]} (i.e., no equal adjacent colors on edges (i,i+1), i=1..k\u22121).\n- r-non-signaling constraints (segment version): For every fixed family F and every core assignment \u03b6 = (\u03b61,\u2026,\u03b6t) with \u03b6j \u2208 \u03a3^{sj}, the marginal probability that the segment-coloring \u03c8 induces \u03b6 on the cores must be independent of the placement \u03c9 of F (as long as all r-buffers lie inside [1..k]):\n  \u03a3\u03c8: \u2200j \u03c8|Cj = \u03b6j p\u03c8 is equal for all gap-r placements \u03c9 of F.\n- Implementation note: It suffices to equate all placements to a fixed choice per F and \u03b6; equivalently, enforce equality for all consecutive placements or to the average. For a valid (non-relaxed) certificate, include all placements \u03c9 whose r-buffers lie in [1..k].\n- Symmetries to reduce size: (i) color permutations S3; (ii) reversals (reflection of the segment); (iii) translations of placements (realized as equality constraints; also exploitable to quotient variables if one switches to a marginal-based parameterization, but we keep p\u03c8 for simplicity). Dropping some constraints gives a relaxation; if its optimum < 1, the true optimum is also < 1.\n\nSmall structural lemmas (useful to guide computation)\n- Monotonicity in k: Let q(r,k) be the LP optimum for fixed r,k. Then q(r,k+1) \u2264 q(r,k). Proof sketch: restriction from length-(k+1) distributions to [1..k] preserves r-non-signaling (buffers still internal), and P[proper on k+1] \u2264 P[proper on first k] pointwise, hence the supremum decreases.\n- Placement invariance (segment version; to be added to output.md): For a fixed r-round quantum LOCAL algorithm with identical initial local states and uniform channels, and for any family F whose r-buffers fit inside [1..k], the distribution of \u03a8(\u03c9+F) is the same for all gap-r placements \u03c9 of F. Proof idea: Heisenberg-evolved effect for the event \u201ccores equal \u03b6\u201d is supported on the union of the r-neighborhoods of the cores. For two placements \u03c9, \u03c9\u2032 inside the segment, these unions are isomorphic balls with identical initial reduced states; therefore the resulting probabilities Tr[\u03c1 X_\u03c9] and Tr[\u03c1 X_\u03c9\u2032] coincide.\n\nConcrete plan for r = 2 LP instances (k \u2248 10\u201316)\n- Variables: p\u03c8, \u03c8 \u2208 \u03a3^k. For k = 12, |\u03a3^k| = 531,441; with S3 color quotienting (factor ~6) and reflection (factor ~2), the effective unknowns can drop by ~10\u00d7\u201312\u00d7. For k = 10 (|\u03a3^k| = 59,049), even a straightforward LP is feasible with a commercial solver; for k = 12 a symmetry-reduced LP ought to be solvable.\n- Constraints: we start with all F consisting of a single core {{s}} with s \u2208 {1,2,3} and all placements \u03c9 with r=2 buffers internal; this enforces translation invariance of 1-, 2-, 3-block marginals. Then we add selected F with two cores (t=2), e.g., ({{1}},{{1}}), ({{2}},{{1}}), ({{2}},{{2}}), with varying separations, again over all placements with r-buffers internal. This matches the spirit of LGR and is already quite restrictive. For a final, fully rigorous certificate, we can include all families F up to, say, t \u2264 3 and core lengths up to 3, across all placements; empirically, this suffices in r=1 to detect q<1.\n- Objective: maximize the probability of 0 violations among the k\u22121 adjacent edges; computed as \u03a3\u03c8 p\u03c8 1{proper(\u03c8)}.\n- Solving and certification: Use a high-precision LP solver; if optimum < 1, extract a dual solution (constraints multipliers) as a certificate. We will archive (r,k,q) alongside the dual to make the bound verifiable.\n\nWhy a point-mass on a proper coloring is infeasible (important sanity check)\n- On a line segment, concentrating p\u03c8 on a single proper \u03c8 does not satisfy non-signaling across placements: single-core constraints force the distribution of s-blocks to be identical for all interior positions; a fixed \u03c8 yields position-dependent s-blocks unless \u03c8 is periodic with period 1 (impossible). Hence the LP can detect q<1 even though proper colorings exist.\n\nGaps or missing details in output.md\n- The current output.md does not yet formalize the \u201cplacement invariance on segments\u201d lemma; we propose to add it, as it justifies the LP constraints from algorithmic locality and symmetry (no IDs, identical initial states).\n- Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 are stated with proof sketches; for a curated document, we should include a short, fully rigorous Heisenberg-picture derivation (operator support growth by at most one hop per round; product initial state factorization yields independence once N_r(S_i) are disjoint). We can reuse the projector construction from LGR Appendix A verbatim with symmetric buffers.\n- We should add an explicit definition subsection for the r-non-signaling LP (variables, constraints, objective) and the monotonicity lemma q(r,k+1) \u2264 q(r,k).\n\nNext steps (auditable)\n1) Add the \u201cplacement invariance on segments\u201d lemma with a concise proof to output.md, and expand proofs of Theorem 1\u20132 to full detail (2\u20133 paragraphs each).\n2) Implement the r = 2 LP generator:\n   - Enumerate \u03a3^k with S3/reflection orbits and map constraints accordingly.\n   - Generate constraints for F \u2208 {(single-core s \u2208 {1,2,3}), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2)} across all gap-2 placements.\n   - Solve for k \u2208 {10,\u2026,16}. Target: locate first k with optimum q < 1; extract dual certificate.\n3) If found (r=2,k,q<1), immediately record: (i) constant error bound with entanglement, P_success(C_n) \u2264 q for n \u2265 k; (ii) exponential bound without entanglement, P_success(C_n) \u2264 q^{\u230an/(k+4)\u230b}.\n4) In parallel, attempt r = 3 with k \u2264 14 under the same constraint families.\n5) Optional analytic route: explore representing feasible processes via stationary order-r Markov chains on \u03a3 and bounding P[no equal adjacencies] under chain constraints; this may yield closed-form witnesses for small k.\n\nSanity checks and toy instances\n- Monotonicity: verify numerically that the LP optimum decreases (or stays equal) as k grows.\n- Minimal placements: confirm that with only single-core constraints, q(r,k) = 1 (insufficient); adding two-core constraints should reduce optimum.\n- Counterexample retention: keep the r=1, 3-node path example in output.md to prevent regressions on the 2r threshold.\n"
