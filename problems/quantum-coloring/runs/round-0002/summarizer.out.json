  "summary_md": "This round fixed the independence/separation threshold to 2r (and updated the amplification stride to k+2r) and isolated a \u201cplacement invariance\u201d principle for interior frames on a line segment: for r\u2011round algorithms with identical initial local states and uniform channels, the marginal on any r\u2011gapped core (fully r\u2011buffered inside the segment) is placement\u2011independent (Heisenberg\u2011picture operator\u2011support argument). A precise r\u2011non\u2011signaling LP on a segment was formulated: variables p_\u03c8 over \u03a3^k (\u03a3={1,2,3}), objective maximizing probability of a proper coloring, and constraints equating core marginals across all gap\u2011r placements; symmetry reductions (S3, reflection) were proposed to shrink problem size. Useful lemmas (monotonicity q(r,k+1)\u2264q(r,k); infeasibility of point\u2011mass proper colorings under placement constraints) were noted. A practical plan targets r=2 LPs for k\u224810\u201316 (single\u2011core s\u2208{1,2,3} plus selected two\u2011core families), solve with high\u2011precision solver, and extract dual certificates if optimum q<1 to obtain auditable bounds and amplification. Files used: prover-01.out.json; LGR Appendix A (projector construction).",
