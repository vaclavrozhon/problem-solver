This round fixed the independence/separation threshold to 2r (and updated the amplification stride to k+2r) and isolated a “placement invariance” principle for interior frames on a line segment: for r‑round algorithms with identical initial local states and uniform channels, the marginal on any r‑gapped core (fully r‑buffered inside the segment) is placement‑independent (Heisenberg‑picture operator‑support argument). A precise r‑non‑signaling LP on a segment was formulated: variables p_ψ over Σ^k (Σ={1,2,3}), objective maximizing probability of a proper coloring, and constraints equating core marginals across all gap‑r placements; symmetry reductions (S3, reflection) were proposed to shrink problem size. Useful lemmas (monotonicity q(r,k+1)≤q(r,k); infeasibility of point‑mass proper colorings under placement constraints) were noted. A practical plan targets r=2 LPs for k≈10–16 (single‑core s∈{1,2,3} plus selected two‑core families), solve with high‑precision solver, and extract dual certificates if optimum q<1 to obtain auditable bounds and amplification.
