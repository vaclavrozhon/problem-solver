High-level assessment: Good progress. The fix to the separation threshold (2r) and to the amplification stride (k + 2r) is correct and aligns with the standard light-cone reasoning and with the path-0–1–2 counterexample for r = 1. The LP formulation is largely sound and much clearer now, and the monotonicity claim q(r,k+1) ≤ q(r,k) is correct with a clean proof via restriction/marginalization.

Critical caveat on “placement invariance”: As currently phrased (“identical initial local states and uniform local channels”), the invariance across interior placements is valid in the product-state regime (no shared entanglement) but is not true in general with shared entanglement if one does not assume global symmetry of the initial state. Minimal counterexample (r = 0): put EPR pairs on disjoint edges (1,2), (3,4), … around the cycle, and have each node measure Z and output a color determined by its bit. The joint distribution on adjacent cores depends on whether the placement lands on a paired edge (correlated) or straddles two different pairs (independent). Thus, equating marginals across placements fails for entangled, non-symmetric initial states.

Resolution: We can add, and use, a rigorous “interior placement invariance” lemma under either (i) product initial states with identical local marginals, or (ii) arbitrary entanglement but an initial global state invariant under the automorphisms of the cycle (rotations/reflections). Uniformity of the local channels is also needed. The Heisenberg-picture proof then goes through: X_ω and X_ω′ are related by the induced permutation of registers; automorphism-invariance of ρ_0 makes Tr[ρ_0 X_ω] = Tr[ρ_0 X_ω′]. We should (a) state the lemma with these assumptions in output.md, (b) explicitly point out the entangled counterexample in notes.md to avoid regressions.

Implications for the LP and bounds:
- The LP with equality across interior placements is valid (necessary) for the product-state regime, and for the entangled regime only if we assume the initial state is automorphism-invariant. Without that assumption, those equalities are not necessary, so using that LP to upper bound the entangled case would be unsound. Please reflect this in output.md.
- The monotonicity lemma q(r,k+1) ≤ q(r,k) is a good, fully rigorous addition.
- The “point mass on a single proper coloring is infeasible” argument is correct under the single-core placement-invariance constraints; it is a helpful sanity check to keep in notes.

Next steps, concretely and auditable:
1) Add to output.md: (i) the interior placement invariance lemma under automorphism-invariance or product states; (ii) a formal definition of the segment LP (variables/objective/constraints and the regime it models); (iii) the monotonicity lemma with a short proof. Add a note that without automorphism-invariance, placement-equality constraints are not justified; include the EPR counterexample in notes.md.
2) Compute r = 2 LP instances for k ∈ {10,…,16} under the product-state/automorphism-invariant regime: start with single-core (s ∈ {1,2,3}) equality constraints, then add two-core families (1,1), (2,1), (2,2) at varying separations. Exploit S3 and reflection symmetry to reduce the LP. Extract dual certificates for any instance with optimum < 1.
3) If a (r,k,q<1) is found: record the exponential bound for no entanglement with stride k + 2r, and the constant bound for the entangled-but-automorphism-invariant regime. State explicitly which regime each bound applies to.
4) Optional: try r = 3 for modest k; and explore an analytic route via stationary order-r Markov chains as a heuristic witness generator.
