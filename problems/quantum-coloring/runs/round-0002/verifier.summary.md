High-level assessment: Good progress. The fix to the separation threshold (2r) and to the amplification stride (k + 2r) is correct and aligns with the standard light-cone reasoning and with the path-0–1–2 counterexample for r = 1. The LP formulation is largely sound and much clearer now, and the monotonicity claim q(r,k+1) ≤ q(r,k) is correct with a clean proof via restriction/marginalization.
