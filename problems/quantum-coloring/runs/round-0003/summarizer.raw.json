The computational plan uses S3+reflection quotienting, staged constraint families (single-core, two-core, t=3), high-precision solvers, and extraction of dual certificates for k ∈ {10..16}, stopping when q < 0.99 (or any q < 1). A transfer-matrix / Markov-chain relaxation is proposed as an independent cross-check. Two textual clarifications are requested in output.md (after Definition 6 and in Corollary 8) to make the symmetry hypothesis explicit. Watchouts: over-reduction of symmetry and illegal interior-placement constraints; include dirac-mass infeasibility as a sanity test.
