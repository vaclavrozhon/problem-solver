High-level assessment: This was a productive round with several useful structural observations (monotonicity in r; extreme-point structure; a concrete computational plan). However, there is a critical modeling issue: the interior-placement equality constraints in Definition 6 and Lemma 5 are currently stated too strongly. They equate core marginals across all placements of a frame family, even when the relative geometry (inter-core distances) differs. That is not implied by light-cone localization plus uniformity, even under automorphism-invariant initial states. Only placements that are related by a graph automorphism (in practice, rotations; reflections only if the algorithm/ports are reflection-invariant) are guaranteed to have equal probabilities. This affects the soundness of Corollary 4 as currently written (it was later corrected in Corollary 8, but the inconsistency remains) and, more importantly, whether the LP’s feasible set contains the actual window marginals of a given algorithm.

Concrete counterexample to the over-strong constraint: Let r = 0, consider a cycle with even n and initial state ρ0 that is the 1/2-mixture of the two perfect matchings of EPR pairs ((1,2),(3,4),…) and ((2,3),(4,5),…); this ρ0 is rotation-invariant. Two cores of length 1 at distance 1 have nontrivial Z-correlations (EPR half the time), whereas two cores at distance 2 are uncorrelated. Thus, equating their joint marginals (as the current Definition 6 does for t = 2 without conditioning on geometry) is unjustified. Equality holds only within a fixed geometry class (same inter-core distances, up to rotation; reflection only if admissible).

Action items we executed: We repaired the formal interface by (i) revising Lemma 5 to only assert equality for placements within the same geometry class (i.e., related by cycle automorphisms), and (ii) revising Definition 6 so the LP enforces interior-placement invariance only within each fixed geometry class. We also removed the unsound Corollary 4 and kept the corrected constant-error bound under automorphism invariance (now numbered as Corollary 10), with an explicit remark pointing to the necessity of symmetry (cf. the EPR-based counterexample).

Validation of new lemmas: Your Lemma A (monotonicity in r) is correct; we added it with a short proof: as r grows, fewer placements are admissible, hence fewer equalities, so the feasible set expands and the optimum is nondecreasing. Lemma B (extreme-point optimality) is standard LP theory; we added it (notationally Lemma 9) after confirming the feasible polytope is nonempty (uniform distribution is feasible) and bounded.

On the transfer-matrix/Markov relaxation: Important correction—restricting to stationary Markov chains defines a subset of the LP-feasible distributions, so maximizing over that subset yields a lower bound on q(r,k), not an upper bound. It is useful as an engineering cross-check (if it already gives < 1, the true q is also < 1 only if we separately certify the LP bound), but it cannot by itself certify an LP-based upper bound on success probability. For certificates that upper-bound q, you must solve a superset or the exact LP and extract a dual.

Next steps, concretely:
- Implement the geometry-aware LP: index multi-core constraints by core lengths and inter-core distances δ (with δj ≥ 2r). Enforce equality across translations (and optionally reflection if you want to assume that symmetry) within each geometry class whose r-buffers fit in [1..k].
- Maintain separate runs with and without reflection constraints to avoid accidental oversymmetrization.
- Sweep r = 2, k ≈ 10–16 as proposed; extract dual certificates whenever q < 1. Verify monotonicities q(r,k+1) ≤ q(r,k) and q(r+1,k) ≥ q(r,k) on the exact (or provably sound) LP.
- Keep the Dirac-mass infeasibility check under the single-core (geometry-aware) constraints.
- Use the Markov-chain relaxation only as a sanity cross-check; do not interpret it as a certifying upper bound.

If you can produce any (r,k,q<1) instance under the sound constraints, we can immediately invoke: (i) exponential decay in n in the product-state regime (stride k+2r), and (ii) an n-independent constant bound under automorphism-invariant entangled initial states.
