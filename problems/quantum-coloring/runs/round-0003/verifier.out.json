  "feedback_md": "High-level assessment: This was a productive round with several useful structural observations (monotonicity in r; extreme-point structure; a concrete computational plan). However, there is a critical modeling issue: the interior-placement equality constraints in Definition 6 and Lemma 5 are currently stated too strongly. They equate core marginals across all placements of a frame family, even when the relative geometry (inter-core distances) differs. That is not implied by light-cone localization plus uniformity, even under automorphism-invariant initial states. Only placements that are related by a graph automorphism (in practice, rotations; reflections only if the algorithm/ports are reflection-invariant) are guaranteed to have equal probabilities. This affects the soundness of Corollary 4 as currently written (it was later corrected in Corollary 8, but the inconsistency remains) and, more importantly, whether the LP\u2019s feasible set contains the actual window marginals of a given algorithm.\n\nConcrete counterexample to the over-strong constraint: Let r = 0, consider a cycle with even n and initial state \u03c10 that is the 1/2-mixture of the two perfect matchings of EPR pairs ((1,2),(3,4),\u2026) and ((2,3),(4,5),\u2026); this \u03c10 is rotation-invariant. Two cores of length 1 at distance 1 have nontrivial Z-correlations (EPR half the time), whereas two cores at distance 2 are uncorrelated. Thus, equating their joint marginals (as the current Definition 6 does for t = 2 without conditioning on geometry) is unjustified. Equality holds only within a fixed geometry class (same inter-core distances, up to rotation; reflection only if admissible).\n\nAction items we executed: We repaired the formal interface by (i) revising Lemma 5 to only assert equality for placements within the same geometry class (i.e., related by cycle automorphisms), and (ii) revising Definition 6 so the LP enforces interior-placement invariance only within each fixed geometry class. We also removed the unsound Corollary 4 and kept the corrected constant-error bound under automorphism invariance (now numbered as Corollary 10), with an explicit remark pointing to the necessity of symmetry (cf. the EPR-based counterexample).\n\nValidation of new lemmas: Your Lemma A (monotonicity in r) is correct; we added it with a short proof: as r grows, fewer placements are admissible, hence fewer equalities, so the feasible set expands and the optimum is nondecreasing. Lemma B (extreme-point optimality) is standard LP theory; we added it (notationally Lemma 9) after confirming the feasible polytope is nonempty (uniform distribution is feasible) and bounded.\n\nOn the transfer-matrix/Markov relaxation: Important correction\u2014restricting to stationary Markov chains defines a subset of the LP-feasible distributions, so maximizing over that subset yields a lower bound on q(r,k), not an upper bound. It is useful as an engineering cross-check (if it already gives < 1, the true q is also < 1 only if we separately certify the LP bound), but it cannot by itself certify an LP-based upper bound on success probability. For certificates that upper-bound q, you must solve a superset or the exact LP and extract a dual.\n\nNext steps, concretely:\n- Implement the geometry-aware LP: index multi-core constraints by core lengths and inter-core distances \u03b4 (with \u03b4j \u2265 2r). Enforce equality across translations (and optionally reflection if you want to assume that symmetry) within each geometry class whose r-buffers fit in [1..k].\n- Maintain separate runs with and without reflection constraints to avoid accidental oversymmetrization.\n- Sweep r = 2, k \u2248 10\u201316 as proposed; extract dual certificates whenever q < 1. Verify monotonicities q(r,k+1) \u2264 q(r,k) and q(r+1,k) \u2265 q(r,k) on the exact (or provably sound) LP.\n- Keep the Dirac-mass infeasibility check under the single-core (geometry-aware) constraints.\n- Use the Markov-chain relaxation only as a sanity cross-check; do not interpret it as a certifying upper bound.\n\nIf you can produce any (r,k,q<1) instance under the sound constraints, we can immediately invoke: (i) exponential decay in n in the product-state regime (stride k+2r), and (ii) an n-independent constant bound under automorphism-invariant entangled initial states.",
  "new_notes_md": "Important correction: geometry-aware interior placement invariance\n- The equalities we enforce must respect automorphism classes of placements. Two placements of t cores are guaranteed to have equal core marginals only if they are related by a cycle automorphism (rotation; reflection only if the model is reflection-invariant). Equating placements with different inter-core distances is not justified by light-cone localization plus uniformity.\n- Minimal counterexample (r = 0, entangled, rotation-invariant): let \u03c10 be the 1/2-mixture of the two perfect matchings of EPR pairs around the cycle. Adjacent vertices have Z-correlations (EPR half the time); vertices at distance 2 are uncorrelated. Thus, two singleton cores at distance 1 vs distance 2 have different joint marginals, defeating geometry-agnostic equality constraints.\n- Fix: Parameterize multi-core constraints by geometry (core lengths s = (s1,\u2026,st) and inter-core gaps \u03b4 = (\u03b41,\u2026,\u03b4t\u22121), where \u03b4j is the number of vertices between cores j and j+1).

Hence an optimal distribution exists and can be taken at an extreme point (basic feasible solution). This supports sparse-support searches and dual-certificate extraction.\n\nAmplification reminders (unchanged)\n- No entanglement: independence requires gaps of size 2r, so the exponential stride is k+2r. The r = 1 path 0\u20131\u20132 counterexample shows smaller gaps are insufficient.\n- With entanglement: constant-error bounds require automorphism-invariant initial states (or an admissible public random rotation to enforce it).

An r-round quantum LOCAL algorithm consists of r synchronous layers of local channels acting on vertex/edge registers, followed by local measurements at the vertices that output colors in {1,2,3}. Each round is modeled as a product of CPTP maps localized on vertices/edges (purifiable to local unitaries by Stinespring dilation). For S \u2286 V, let N_r(S) = {v \u2208 V : dist(v, S) \u2264 r} denote the r-neighborhood of S.\n\nTheorem 1 (Light-cone localization and r-non-signaling)\nFix an r-round quantum LOCAL algorithm. Let S \u2286 V, and let M_S be any POVM element that depends only on the final local measurements in S. Then there exists a positive operator X_S supported only on the registers associated with N_r(S) (and ancillas therein) such that, for every initial global state \u03c1 (possibly entangled), the probability of M_S is Tr[\u03c1 X_S]. Consequently, if two initial states \u03c1 and \u03c1\u2032 agree on N_r(S), then the output marginal on S is the same under \u03c1 and \u03c1\u2032.\n\nProof sketch (standard): Purify to a depth-r circuit of local unitaries. In the Heisenberg picture, conjugating M_S backward through each round enlarges its support by at most one graph hop. After r rounds, the evolved effect X_S is supported on N_r(S). For any \u03c1, P[M_S] = Tr[\u03c1 X_S]. If \u03c1 and \u03c1\u2032 coincide on N_r(S), then Tr[\u03c1 X_S] = Tr[\u03c1\u2032 X_S].\n\nTheorem 2 (Independence beyond 2r without initial entanglement)\nAssume the initial state is a product across vertices, \u03c1 = \u2297_{v\u2208V} \u03c1_v. Let S_1, \u2026, S_m \u2286 V have pairwise disjoint r-neighborhoods (equivalently, dist(S_i, S_j) > 2r for i \u2260 j). For each i, let M_{S_i} be any event depending only on measurements in S_i, and let X_{S_i} be its Heisenberg-evolved effect from Theorem 1. Then the random outcomes on S_1, \u2026, S_m are mutually independent; in particular,\nTr[\u03c1 X_{S_1} \u22ef X_{S_m}] = \u220f_{i=1}^m Tr[\u03c1_{N_r(S_i)} X_{S_i}].\n\nProof: Each X_{S_i} acts only on N_r(S_i); these supports are disjoint, and \u03c1 factors across them. The trace of the product factors, which is precisely independence.\n\nCorollary 3 (Exponential amplification without entanglement)\nLet r \u2265 1. Fix k \u2265 1 and suppose there exists q < 1 such that, for every distribution on a length-k path segment that satisfies the LP constraints in Definition 6 (below), the probability the segment is internally proper is at most q. Then, for any r-round two-way quantum LOCAL algorithm on the n-cycle with product initial state, the success probability satisfies\nP_success(C_n) \u2264 q^{\u230an / (k + 2r)\u230b}.\n\nProof: Partition the cycle into m = \u230an / (k + 2r)\u230b disjoint windows of length k separated by gaps of size 2r. If the cycle is proper, each window is internally proper. Let E_i be \u201cwindow i is internally proper,\u201d and X_i its Heisenberg-evolved effect. Supports N_r(W_i) are disjoint, so E_i are independent by Theorem 2. By the segment-level bound, P[E_i] \u2264 q. Hence P_success(C_n) \u2264 \u220f_i P[E_i] \u2264 q^m.\n\nRemark 4 (Necessity of the 2r separation)\nFor r = 1 on a path 0\u20131\u20132, one round suffices for node 1 to correlate nodes 0 and 2 (e.g., by broadcasting a private random bit), so outputs at distance 2 need not be independent. Thus 2r is tight in general.\n\nLemma 5 (Automorphism-covariant interior placement invariance for fixed geometries)\nFix an r-round uniform quantum LOCAL algorithm on a cycle C_n, with initial global state \u03c1_0. Let W \u2286 C_n be any contiguous window of length k. Consider t cores with lengths s = (s_1,\u2026,s_t), and let \u03b4 = (\u03b4_1,\u2026,\u03b4_{t\u22121}) be nonnegative integers encoding the inter-core gaps (\u03b4_j is the number of vertices strictly between core j and core j+1). Let \u03c9 and \u03c9\u2032 be two r-gapped placements of (s, \u03b4) inside W (i.e., all r-buffers lie in W and \u03b4_j \u2265 2r). Assume \u03c1_0 is invariant under the rotations of C_n (reflections as well if the model is reflection-invariant). Then, for every core assignment \u03b6, the probability that the outputs on the cores equal \u03b6 is the same for \u03c9 and \u03c9\u2032.\n\nProof: Let U_\u03c9 \u2286 W and U_{\u03c9\u2032} \u2286 W be the unions of the r-neighborhoods of the cores. Because \u03c9 and \u03c9\u2032 have the same geometry (s, \u03b4), there exists a rotation (and possibly a reflection) \u03c0 of C_n mapping U_\u03c9 to U_{\u03c9\u2032} and carrying each core in \u03c9 to the corresponding core in \u03c9\u2032. By Theorem 1, there exist positive operators X_\u03c9 and X_{\u03c9\u2032} supported on U_\u03c9 and U_{\u03c9\u2032} giving the core-event probabilities as Tr[\u03c1_0 X_\u03c9] and Tr[\u03c1_0 X_{\u03c9\u2032}]. Uniformity implies covariance under \u03c0: X_{\u03c9\u2032} = U_\u03c0 X_\u03c9 U_\u03c0^\u2020. Since \u03c1_0 is invariant under \u03c0, Tr[\u03c1_0 X_{\u03c9\u2032}] = Tr[\u03c1_0 X_\u03c9].\n\nDefinition 6 (Segment LP with geometry-aware interior invariance)\nFix \u03a3 = {1,2,3}, r \u2265 1, k \u2265 1. A geometry is a pair (s, \u03b4) with s = (s_1,\u2026,s_t) positive integers and \u03b4 = (\u03b4_1,\u2026,\u03b4_{t\u22121}) nonnegative integers. An r-gapped placement \u03c9 of (s, \u03b4) inside [1..k] is a t-tuple of start positions (\u03c9_1 < \u22ef < \u03c9_t) such that each core C_j = [\u03c9_j .. \u03c9_j + s_j \u2212 1] has its r-buffer C_j^{(+r)} = [\u03c9_j \u2212 r .. \u03c9_j + s_j \u2212 1 + r] contained in [1..k], these r-buffers are pairwise disjoint, and \u03c9_{j+1} = \u03c9_j + s_j + \u03b4_j. The variables are p_\u03c8 for \u03c8 \u2208 \u03a3^k, with p_\u03c8 \u2265 0 and \u2211_\u03c8 p_\u03c8 = 1. The objective is to maximize \u2211_\u03c8 p_\u03c8 \u00b7 1{\u03c8 has no equal-color adjacencies on edges (i,i+1), i = 1..k\u22121}. The constraints enforce interior placement invariance within fixed geometries: for every geometry (s, \u03b4), every core assignment \u03b6, and every two r-gapped placements \u03c9, \u03c9\u2032 of (s, \u03b4) inside [1..k], the marginal \u2211_{\u03c8: \u2200j \u03c8|_{C_j(\u03c9)} = \u03b6_j} p_\u03c8 equals \u2211_{\u03c8: \u2200j \u03c8|_{C_j(\u03c9\u2032)} = \u03b6_j} p_\u03c8. Denote the optimum by q(r,k).\n\nRemark 6.1 (Soundness regimes and symmetry)\nThese equality constraints are necessary for r-round uniform algorithms under either of the following assumptions: (i) product initial states with identical local marginals (\u2297_v \u03c1; rotation-invariant), or (ii) arbitrary shared entanglement provided the initial global state is invariant under the rotations of the cycle (reflections as well if the model is reflection-invariant). Without such symmetry in the initial state, the constraints need not hold across placements, even within the same window.\n\nLemma 7 (Monotonicity in k)\nFor all r \u2265 1 and k \u2265 1, q(r,k+1) \u2264 q(r,k).\n\nProof: Let p be feasible for (r,k+1). Its marginal p\u2032 on the first k coordinates satisfies all geometry-aware invariance constraints for (r,k): any placement inside [1..k] remains a placement inside [1..k+1], and equalities are preserved under marginalization. Moreover 1{proper on k+1} \u2264 1{proper on first k} pointwise, hence \u2211_\u03c8 p_\u03c8\u00b71{proper on k+1} \u2264 \u2211_{\u03c8\u2032} p\u2032_{\u03c8\u2032}\u00b71{proper on k}. Taking suprema over feasible p proves the claim.\n\nLemma 8 (Monotonicity in r)\nFor all r \u2265 1 and k \u2265 1, q(r+1,k) \u2265 q(r,k).\n\nProof: As r increases to r+1, the set of admissible placements (and hence the set of equality constraints) for any geometry (s, \u03b4) weakens: some placements cease to be admissible because r-buffers no longer fit or become non-disjoint. Therefore the feasible set enlarges, and the supremum cannot decrease.\n\nLemma 9 (Extreme-point optimality)\nFor each fixed (r,k), the feasible region of Definition 6 is a nonempty polytope in R^{3^k} defined by linear equalities, nonnegativity, and normalization. Hence an optimal solution exists and can be taken at an extreme point (basic feasible solution).\n\nProof: Nonemptiness follows from the uniform distribution p_\u03c8 = 3^{-k}, which satisfies all equality constraints. Boundedness follows from nonnegativity and normalization. Linear programming theory guarantees that a maximum exists and is achieved at an extreme point of the polytope.\n\nCorollary 10 (Constant-error bound with entanglement under automorphism invariance)\nLet r \u2265 1 and k \u2265 1, and let q(r,k) be as in Definition 6. Consider any r-round uniform quantum LOCAL algorithm on C_n whose initial global state is invariant under the rotations of the cycle. Then, for all n \u2265 k, the success probability obeys P_success(C_n) \u2264 q(r,k).\n\nProof: Fix any contiguous window W \u2286 C_n of length k. If the cycle is properly colored, then W is internally proper. By Lemma 5, the distribution on W (restricted to events supported on geometry-aware r-buffered placements) satisfies the invariance constraints of Definition 6. Therefore it is feasible for the LP, and the probability that W is internally proper is at most q(r,k). Since {cycle proper} \u2286 {W proper}, P_success(C_n) \u2264 q(r,k). (Necessity of the symmetry assumption is illustrated by the EPR counterexample in the notes.)",
