High-level assessment: This was a productive round with several useful structural observations (monotonicity in r; extreme-point structure; a concrete computational plan). However, there is a critical modeling issue: the interior-placement equality constraints in Definition 6 and Lemma 5 are currently stated too strongly. They equate core marginals across all placements of a frame family, even when the relative geometry (inter-core distances) differs. That is not implied by light-cone localization plus uniformity, even under automorphism-invariant initial states. Only placements that are related by a graph automorphism (in practice, rotations; reflections only if the algorithm/ports are reflection-invariant) are guaranteed to have equal probabilities. This affects the soundness of Corollary 4 as currently written (it was later corrected in Corollary 8, but the inconsistency remains) and, more importantly, whether the LP’s feasible set contains the actual window marginals of a given alg
