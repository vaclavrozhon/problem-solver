  "progress_md": "Headlines for this round\n- Critical observation: the current geometry-aware non-signaling LP in Definition 6 is too weak to certify any nontrivial bound in the two-way model (with or without entanglement). In fact, for every r \u2265 1 and k \u2265 1 one can construct a feasible distribution with success 1. Hence q(r,k) = 1 under Definition 6, and the LP as stated cannot yield the desired constant-error lower bound. We give an explicit feasible \u201cstationary proper Markov chain\u201d witness and verify it satisfies all geometry-aware placement-invariance constraints while assigning probability 1 to proper colorings. This reveals a gap in output.md: constant-error bounds cannot be extracted from this LP for two-way algorithms.\n- Implication: to obtain any nontrivial bound for 2\u20133 rounds, we must strengthen the constraint system beyond geometry-aware invariance. For product initial states, independence across sets whose 2r-neighborhoods are disjoint is valid, but it is nonlinear (factorization) and thus does not fit directly in a linear program. For the entanglement-allowed regime, no such independence holds, so even stronger difficulty arises\u2014non-signaling alone is insufficient.\n- We propose two corrective directions: (A) independence-augmented constraints for the product-state regime (leading to a non-linear, or lifted, formulation); (B) switch to ring-level \u201cexperiment\u201d arguments tailored for two-way (rather than the segment-LP), or to LCL-round-elimination style arguments yielding constant-error lower bounds for fixed r.\n\nGap in output.md (and why)\n- Definition 6 + Lemma 5 (geometry-aware invariance within automorphism classes) are correct and sound. However, the discussion that suggests solving this LP for r = 2,3 and extracting q < 1 (progress.md Round 0001\u20130003; output.md Constant-error bound, Corollary 10, \u201csegment LP\u201d as the vehicle) is too optimistic: the LP feasible region is broad enough to include measures supported entirely on proper strings.\n- Concrete witness (feasibility with objective 1). Consider the order-1 Markov chain on \u03a3 = {1,2,3} with stationary distribution u(\u03c3) = 1/3 and transition matrix P with P(\u03c3\u2192\u03c3) = 0 and P(\u03c3\u2192\u03c4) = 1/2 for all \u03c4 \u2260 \u03c3. Let p_k be the induced distribution on \u03a3^k generated by (X_1,\u2026,X_k) with X_1 \u223c u and X_{i+1} | X_i \u223c P. Then:\n  \u2022 Support: p_k(\u03c8) = 0 whenever \u03c8 has any equal adjacent colors; thus \u2211_\u03c8 p_k(\u03c8)\u00b71{proper(\u03c8)} = 1.\n  \u2022 Interior single-core invariance: For any core length s and any interior position i (with r-buffers inside [1..k]), the marginal law of (X_i,\u2026,X_{i+s-1}) is the stationary s-block law of the chain, independent of i. Hence all single-core equalities across interior translations are satisfied.\n  \u2022 Geometry-aware multi-core invariance: For any geometry (s,\u03b4) and two r-gapped placements \u03c9, \u03c9\u2032 of (s,\u03b4) inside [1..k], the joint law of the blocks (centered at the cores) depends only on (s,\u03b4) (i.e., on inter-core separations), and not on absolute position. Therefore all geometry-aware multi-core constraints in Definition 6 hold. (The only admissibility requirement is \u03b4_j \u2265 2r, which we respect by picking placements with disjoint r-buffers; stationarity ensures invariance across interior translations for each fixed geometry.)\n- Since p_k is feasible and achieves objective value 1, we have q(r,k) = 1 for all r,k under Definition 6. Thus, the (segment) LP cannot witness q < 1 in the two-way model and provides no constant-error bound in Corollary 10 beyond the trivial bound 1. This should be clearly stated in output.md, and the current plan \u201csolve the LP for r = 2,3 to get q < 1\u201d should be revised.\n\nConsequences and revised modeling proposals\n- Product-state (no entanglement) regime:\n  \u2022 Valid extra structure: independence across regions whose r-neighborhoods are disjoint (in our setting: beyond 2r for two-way). This implies that, for any geometry (s,\u03b4) with pairwise \u03b4_j \u2265 2r and placements \u03c9, the joint law on the cores factorizes across connected components of the union of r-buffers. Unfortunately, factorization constraints are multiplicative (bilinear if expressed in terms of probabilities); hence the natural feasible set is not a polytope. Adding \u201cindependence\u201d to Definition 6 transforms the LP into a non-linear (and non-convex) program.\n  \u2022 Auditable alternative (still linear, but stronger than Definition 6): Introduce auxiliary variables for joint marginals on tuples of cores and impose linear consistency across overlaps together with linear \u201cbounds\u201d implied by independence (e.g., all 2\u00d72 minors nonnegative inequalities, union/intersection bounds). These are necessary but not sufficient for independence; they cut off some (but not all) spurious feasible points such as the Markov-chain witness. The hope is that a sufficiently rich hierarchy of such linear constraints (e.g., k-local consistency with lifted variables) already forces q(r,k) < 1 for small k,r. This is akin to local-consistency/Sherali\u2013Adams lift-and-project. We propose to instantiate the first 1\u20132 lift levels and test.\n  \u2022 Nonlinear route (exact): Enforce true factorization for disjoint unions by constraints of the form P(A\u2229B) = P(A)P(B), where A,B are cylinder events on disjoint r-buffers. This yields a polynomial system (bilinear equalities). One can attack it with algebraic or mixed-integer programming tools, or via iterative convex relaxations (e.g., log-likelihood parametrization) \u2014 at least for small k. A negative certificate (infeasibility at value 1) would give the desired q(r,k) < 1.\n- Entanglement-allowed regime:\n  \u2022 No independence is valid; only non-signaling and geometry-aware invariance hold. As the Markov-chain witness shows, these are insufficient to rule out perfect (segment-level) properness. Consequently, our prior plan to get a constant-error bound via the segment LP is not viable.\n  \u2022 For ring-level bounds, one-way r = 1 enjoyed special non-signaling equalities collapsing dependence on distance, which powered LGR\u2019s bias method. In two-way, pair laws explicitly depend on distance, so that collapse is unavailable. This strongly suggests that non-signaling-only methods cannot give nontrivial constant-error bounds for 3-coloring in small two-way rounds.\n\nAlternative analytic avenues for small fixed rounds (r = 2,3)\n- Classical LCL lower bounds (no entanglement) imply that 3-coloring cycles needs \u03c9(1) rounds (\u0398(log* n)) in the LOCAL model. In particular, no 2- or 3-round (randomized) classical algorithm can succeed with probability 1. However, these results do not immediately give a uniform n-independent constant error lower bound. We suggest to target the following more modest, but auditable, goal:\n  \u2022 Claim (target): For any fixed r, there exists \u03b5(r) > 0 and k = k(r) such that any r-round classical algorithm (hence any quantum w/o entanglement) on C_n has P_success \u2264 1 \u2212 \u03b5(r) for all n \u2265 k.\n  \u2022 Sketch of route: Use the round-elimination/indistinguishability toolkit to construct, for large enough n, two inputs (e.g., two rotations of a sparse \u201cseed\u201d pattern) whose r-views are locally indistinguishable at a positive fraction of nodes, yet whose global constraints force inconsistent local choices. A counting/averaging argument (e.g., via the hard-core potential method) yields a constant gap. This can be adapted to randomized algorithms by conditioning on a typical event of the private randomness. We will prototype this for r = 2.\n- \u03d5-LOCAL approach: In the \u03c6-LOCAL model (Gavoille\u2013Kosowski\u2013Markiewicz 2009), strong view-based lower bounds hold (e.g., for MIS, 2-coloring); for 3-coloring cycles in small rounds the situation is open. We suggest to explore whether \u03c6-LOCAL prohibits perfect 3-coloring in r = 2, by constructing two inputs with identical V_r-views at a positive fraction of edges but globally incompatible under properness. Any such lower bound would automatically apply to quantum models by Theorem 2 in their paper.\n\nConcrete items for the verifier (auditable)\n1) Insert into output.md an explicit Proposition: Under Definition 6, q(r,k) = 1 for all r \u2265 1, k \u2265 1; include the stationary proper Markov chain witness and a short verification of feasibility and objective = 1. This corrects the current suggestion that the LP may yield q < 1 in two-way.\n2) State explicitly that, consequently, the segment LP cannot certify any constant-error lower bound in the two-way model (with or without entanglement). Corollary 10 remains formally correct, but vacuous with this LP (it upper-bounds by 1).\n3) Fork the plan into two tracks:\n   - Track A (product state): develop independence-augmented formulations. Start with a lifted linear relaxation (Sherali\u2013Adams level-1/2) that adds auxiliary joint variables for disjoint cores and imposes linear consistency; test r = 2, k \u2208 {10,\u2026,16}. If any such relaxation already yields q < 1, extract a dual certificate (linear inequality). In parallel, set up a small non-linear system encoding exact factorization for a few geometries and solve by algebraic tools for k \u2272 12.\n   - Track B (entanglement allowed): pivot away from segment LP; attempt direct two-way analogues of LGR\u2019s ring-level \u201cexperiment\u201d method tailored to r = 2 (design mixes of distances leveraging light-cone symmetries that must equalize certain expectations), or use \u03c6-LOCAL/view indistinguishability to obtain constant-error lower bounds for fixed r.\n4) Document a minimal analytic example showing how the stationary proper Markov chain satisfies the geometry-aware equality constraints (single-core, two-core, and t = 3 cores) for arbitrary placements with fixed (s,\u03b4). This serves as a counter-model to avoid future regressions.\n\nMinor clarifications to add in output.md\n- Corollary 10: emphasize its scope is only as strong as the segment certificate; with Definition 6 alone, the bound is 1. Note the necessity of rotation (and potentially reflection) invariance in the initial state.\n- Assumptions about uniformity: clarify that \u201cuniform algorithm\u201d implies the same local CPTP maps at each vertex and that rotations/reflections act covariantly; otherwise even geometry-aware equalities need not hold.\n\nNext steps (short horizon)\n- Formalize and insert the \u201cq(r,k) = 1\u201d proposition in output.md with the stationary Markov chain witness.\n- Draft the lifted (Sherali\u2013Adams type) linear relaxation for independence across two disjoint cores (t = 2) and their blocks, and implement constraint generation for r = 2, k up to 12; empirically test whether this already forces q < 1.\n- Begin drafting a ring-level indistinguishability argument for r = 2: identify a finite family of local views and a probabilistic planting that forces a constant fraction of edges to be \u201clocally ambiguous\u201d in a way incompatible with 3-coloring.\n"
