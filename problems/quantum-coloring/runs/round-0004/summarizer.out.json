  "summary_md": "Main finding: the geometry-aware non-signaling LP in Definition 6 is too weak for the two-way model \u2014 there is an explicit feasible distribution that attains objective value 1 for every r \u2265 1 and k \u2265 1, so q(r,k)=1. Concretely, the order-1 stationary Markov chain on \u03a3={1,2,3} with uniform stationary law and P(\u03c3\u2192\u03c3)=0, P(\u03c3\u2192\u03c4)=1/2 (\u03c4\u2260\u03c3) generates only proper strings and satisfies all single- and multi-core geometry-aware translation invariances, so it is a feasible witness with success probability 1. Consequence: the segment LP (Definition 6) cannot certify any nontrivial constant-error lower bound in the two-way model (with or without entanglement); Corollary 10 is vacuous unless the constraint system is strengthened. Recommended corrective directions: (A) for product initial states, add independence/factorization constraints (nonlinear) or a lifted linear relaxation (Sherali\u2013Adams style) to cut off the Markov witness; (B) for the entanglement-allowed regime, pivot to ring-level/ring-experiment or round-elimination/indistinguishability arguments tailored to small fixed r (start with r=2).

    "Existence of a stationary order-1 Markov-chain witness (\u03a3={1,2,3}, no self-loops, uniform stationary law) that produces only proper colorings and satisfies all geometry-aware invariance constraints \u2192 feasible LP value 1.",
    "Under Definition 6, q(r,k)=1 for all r,k; hence the current geometry-aware non-signaling LP cannot yield a nontrivial constant-error lower bound for two-way algorithms (entangled or not).",
    "Lemma 5 and the geometry-aware invariance statements are sound, but they do not suffice to exclude perfect solutions; the prior plan to solve the segment LP for r=2,3 to obtain q<1 is overly optimistic and must be revised.",
    "For product-state (no entanglement) algorithms, true independence across disjoint r-neighborhoods is valid but nonlinear (factorization). One can attempt (i) exact bilinear factorization constraints or (ii) lifted linear relaxations (Sherali\u2013Adams) to approximate independence.",
    "For entanglement-allowed algorithms, independence cannot be assumed; non-signaling + geometry-aware invariance alone is insufficient, so segment-LP approaches are unlikely to succeed.",
    "Practical corrective plan: (i) insert explicit q(r,k)=1 proposition + Markov witness in output.md; (ii) fork into Track A (lifted/nonlinear independence constraints, test SA level 1/2 for r=2, k\u224810\u201316) and Track B (ring-level experiments / round-elimination/\u03c6-LOCAL indistinguishability for r=2)."

    "Add to output.md the explicit proposition (with the Markov-chain witness and concise verification) that q(r,k)=1 under Definition 6 \u2014 can you formalize and commit this text?",
