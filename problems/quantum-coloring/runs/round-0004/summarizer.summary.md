Main finding: the geometry-aware non-signaling LP in Definition 6 is too weak for the two-way model — there is an explicit feasible distribution that attains objective value 1 for every r ≥ 1 and k ≥ 1, so q(r,k)=1. Concretely, the order-1 stationary Markov chain on Σ={1,2,3} with uniform stationary law and P(σ→σ)=0, P(σ→τ)=1/2 (τ≠σ) generates only proper strings and satisfies all single- and multi-core geometry-aware translation invariances, so it is a feasible witness with success probability 1. Consequence: the segment LP (Definition 6) cannot certify any nontrivial constant-error lower bound in the two-way model (with or without entanglement); Corollary 10 is vacuous unless the constraint system is strengthened. Recommended corrective directions: (A) for product initial states, add independence/factorization constraints (nonlinear) or a lifted linear relaxation (Sherali–Adams style) to cut off the Markov witness; (B) for the entanglement-allowed regime, pivot to ring-level/ring-experiment or round-elimination/indistinguishability arguments tailored to small fixed r (start with r=2).
