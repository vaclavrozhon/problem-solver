Summary of audit and implications
- Core claim verified: Under Definition 6 (geometry-aware interior placement invariance), the segment LP is too weak in the two-way model. The stationary order-1 Markov chain on Σ = {1,2,3} with no self-loops (P(i→i)=0, P(i→j)=1/2 for j≠i) and stationary initial law u ≡ 1/3 yields, for every k and r, a feasible distribution p on Σ^k with objective value 1. This p assigns probability 1 to internally proper strings (no equal adjacencies), and because the chain is strictly stationary, all single-core and multi-core marginals (for fixed geometry (s,δ)) are invariant under interior translations. If reflection-invariance constraints are also imposed, the witness still works because the chain is reversible (P = P* under u). Thus q(r,k)=1 for all r,k under Definition 6.
- Rigor check of constraints: The multi-core constraints require equality across placements with the same (s,δ) and interior r-buffers. For any two such placements ω,ω′ there is a common translation τ so that core index sets satisfy C(ω′)=C(ω)+τ. Strict stationarity of the chain implies equality of all these joint core marginals. Nonnegativity and normalization are immediate; objective = 1 holds since adjacent colors are never equal in the chain. Therefore the feasible point is valid, and the LP optimum equals 1.
- Consequences: (i) Solving the current LP (Definition 6) cannot yield any nontrivial q<1 for any r,k, in either the entanglement-allowed or product-state regimes. (ii) Corollary 10 remains true but becomes vacuous with this LP: it only implies P_success ≤ 1. (iii) To obtain constant-error lower bounds, the model must be strengthened beyond geometry-aware invariance.

Value triage and recommended directions
- Product-state (no entanglement): Independence across sets whose r-neighborhoods are disjoint (>2r separation) is valid but nonlinear (factorization). Two concrete tracks:
  1) Lifted linear relaxation (Sherali–Adams flavor): Introduce auxiliary joint variables for tuples of cores; enforce linear consistency across overlaps; add all interior-translation equalities. These constraints are necessary for the existence of a global product-state factorization and will exclude the Markov-chain witness. Start with level-1/2 lifts and test r=2, k∈{10,…,16}. Extract dual certificates if q<1 appears.
  2) Nonlinear exact factorization: Add equalities P(A∩B)=P(A)P(B) for cylinder events A,B supported on disjoint r-neighborhoods (δ≥2r). Solve the resulting bilinear system for small k (≤12) via algebraic or mixed-integer methods. Any infeasibility at value 1 gives a rigorous certificate q(r,k)<1.
- Entanglement allowed: Non-signaling plus geometry-aware invariance is insufficient (witness above). Pivot to ring-level arguments: (i) two-way analogues of LGR’s “experiment” method tailored to r=2, using cleverly mixed distances to force equalities of certain expectations; (ii) indistinguishability/view arguments (φ-LOCAL or round-elimination style) to prove a uniform ε(r)>0 constant-error lower bound for small r. Target r=2 first.

Immediate, auditable action items
1) Insert in output.md a formal proposition with proof that q(r,k)=1 for all r,k under Definition 6 (give the stationary proper Markov-chain witness and verify single-, two-, and three-core constraints explicitly via stationarity). Add a corollary stating the LP cannot certify constant-error bounds in two-way.
2) Update notes.md to prominently record this limitation and fork the plan into Track A (product state, independence-augmented) and Track B (entanglement allowed, ring-level experiments/φ-LOCAL).
3) For Track A, instantiate the first lifted relaxation and, in parallel, a small nonlinear system for r=2, k≤12. Define the exact event families to factorize (e.g., 1- and 2-core cylinder events) and implement constraint generation.
4) For Track B, draft a minimal r=2 indistinguishability construction: identify two globally incompatible 3-coloring templates that induce identical r-views on a positive fraction of nodes/edges and quantify the resulting constant gap via averaging.
