  "feedback_md": "Summary of audit and implications\n- Core claim verified: Under Definition 6 (geometry-aware interior placement invariance), the segment LP is too weak in the two-way model. The stationary order-1 Markov chain on \u03a3 = {1,2,3} with no self-loops (P(i\u2192i)=0, P(i\u2192j)=1/2 for j\u2260i) and stationary initial law u \u2261 1/3 yields, for every k and r, a feasible distribution p on \u03a3^k with objective value 1. This p assigns probability 1 to internally proper strings (no equal adjacencies), and because the chain is strictly stationary, all single-core and multi-core marginals (for fixed geometry (s,\u03b4)) are invariant under interior translations. If reflection-invariance constraints are also imposed, the witness still works because the chain is reversible (P = P* under u). Thus q(r,k)=1 for all r,k under Definition 6.\n- Rigor check of constraints: The multi-core constraints require equality across placements with the same (s,\u03b4) and interior r-buffers. For any two such placements \u03c9,\u03c9\u2032 there is a common translation \u03c4 so that core index sets satisfy C(\u03c9\u2032)=C(\u03c9)+\u03c4. Strict stationarity of the chain implies equality of all these joint core marginals. Nonnegativity and normalization are immediate; objective = 1 holds since adjacent colors are never equal in the chain. Therefore the feasible point is valid, and the LP optimum equals 1.\n- Consequences: (i) Solving the current LP (Definition 6) cannot yield any nontrivial q<1 for any r,k, in either the entanglement-allowed or product-state regimes. (ii) Corollary 10 remains true but becomes vacuous with this LP: it only implies P_success \u2264 1. (iii) To obtain constant-error lower bounds, the model must be strengthened beyond geometry-aware invariance.\n\nValue triage and recommended directions\n- Product-state (no entanglement): Independence across sets whose r-neighborhoods are disjoint (>2r separation) is valid but nonlinear (factorization). Two concrete tracks:\n  1) Lifted linear relaxation (Sherali\u2013Adams flavor): Introduce auxiliary joint variables for tuples of cores; enforce linear consistency across overlaps; add all interior-translation equalities. These constraints are necessary for the existence of a global product-state factorization and will exclude the Markov-chain witness. Start with level-1/2 lifts and test r=2, k\u2208{10,\u2026,16}. Extract dual certificates if q<1 appears.\n  2) Nonlinear exact factorization: Add equalities P(A\u2229B)=P(A)P(B) for cylinder events A,B supported on disjoint r-neighborhoods (\u03b4\u22652r). Solve the resulting bilinear system for small k (\u226412) via algebraic or mixed-integer methods. Any infeasibility at value 1 gives a rigorous certificate q(r,k)<1.\n- Entanglement allowed: Non-signaling plus geometry-aware invariance is insufficient (witness above). Pivot to ring-level arguments: (i) two-way analogues of LGR\u2019s \u201cexperiment\u201d method tailored to r=2, using cleverly mixed distances to force equalities of certain expectations; (ii) indistinguishability/view arguments (\u03c6-LOCAL or round-elimination style) to prove a uniform \u03b5(r)>0 constant-error lower bound for small r. Target r=2 first.\n\nImmediate, auditable action items\n1) Insert in output.md a formal proposition with proof that q(r,k)=1 for all r,k under Definition 6 (give the stationary proper Markov-chain witness and verify single-, two-, and three-core constraints explicitly via stationarity). Add a corollary stating the LP cannot certify constant-error bounds in two-way.\n2) Update notes.md to prominently record this limitation and fork the plan into Track A (product state, independence-augmented) and Track B (entanglement allowed, ring-level experiments/\u03c6-LOCAL).\n3) For Track A, instantiate the first lifted relaxation and, in parallel, a small nonlinear system for r=2, k\u226412. Define the exact event families to factorize (e.g., 1- and 2-core cylinder events) and implement constraint generation.\n4) For Track B, draft a minimal r=2 indistinguishability construction: identify two globally incompatible 3-coloring templates that induce identical r-views on a positive fraction of nodes/edges and quantify the resulting constant gap via averaging.",
  "new_notes_md": "Critical correction: the segment LP (Definition 6) is too weak for two-way\n- New fact. For every r \u2265 1 and k \u2265 1, the LP optimum q(r,k) in Definition 6 equals 1. A feasible witness achieving objective 1 is given by the order-1 Markov chain on \u03a3={1,2,3} with stationary distribution u\u22611/3 and transition matrix P with P(i,i)=0 and P(i,j)=1/2 for j\u2260i. Let p_k be the law of (X_1,\u2026,X_k) with X_1\u223cu and X_{t+1}|X_t\u223cP. Then p_k assigns probability 1 to internally proper strings, and because (X_t) is strictly stationary, all core marginals for any fixed geometry (s,\u03b4) are invariant under interior translations, hence all Definition 6 constraints hold. If reflection constraints are included, the chain remains feasible because it is reversible under u.\n- Implication. The current LP cannot certify any nontrivial bound q<1 in the two-way model (with or without entanglement). Corollary 10 remains formally valid but is vacuous with this LP (it upper-bounds by 1).\n\nWhy the witness satisfies the geometry-aware equalities (minimal checks)\n- Single core (t=1). For any s and any interior position i, the s-block (X_i,\u2026,X_{i+s\u22121}) has the stationary s-block law; translation of i within the window preserves the law.\n- Two cores (t=2). For s=(s1,s2) and gap \u03b4\u22652r, the joint law of the two blocks depends only on \u03b4 (and s1,s2); by strict stationarity, translating the placement within [1..k] does not change this joint law.\n- Three cores (t=3). Similarly, for s=(s1,s2,s3) and gaps \u03b4=(\u03b41,\u03b42) with \u03b4j\u22652r, the joint law of the three blocks depends only on the inter-core separations, not on absolute position; interior translations preserve it.\n\nConsequences for modeling and plan (forked)\n- Track A (product-state, no entanglement): Independence across regions whose r-neighborhoods are disjoint (>2r separation) must be used. This is nonlinear (factorization). Two practical approaches:\n  1) Lifted linear relaxation (Sherali\u2013Adams style): Introduce auxiliary variables for joint marginals on small tuples of cores; enforce linear consistency across overlaps and interior-translation equalities; add necessary linear bounds implied by independence (e.g., Fr\u00e9chet inequalities for all pairs). This excludes some spurious correlated witnesses (including the Markov chain) and may already force q<1 for small r,k.\n  2) Nonlinear exact factorization: Add constraints P(A\u2229B)=P(A)P(B) for cylinder events A,B supported on disjoint r-buffers. Solve the resulting bilinear system for r=2 and k\u226412 using algebraic/MIP methods. Any infeasibility at value 1 yields the desired q(r,k)<1.\n- Track B (entanglement allowed): The segment LP cannot help. Pursue ring-level methods: (i) tailor LGR-style experiments for two-way r=2 to derive linear identities that cannot hold simultaneously under properness; (ii) indistinguishability/\u03c6-LOCAL arguments to prove uniform \u03b5(r)>0 constant-error lower bounds for fixed small r. Start at r=2.\n\nNear-term to-dos\n- Archive a formal statement and proof that q(r,k)=1 (now added to output.md) to prevent regressions.\n- Implement Track A level-1/2 lift and a small exact factorization instance for r=2, k\u226412, and test whether q<1 emerges. Extract and store any dual certificates (linear inequalities) obtained.\n- Begin a concrete r=2 indistinguishability construction: enumerate r-views on the cycle; design two globally incompatible templates sharing those r-views on a positive fraction of positions; quantify a constant contradiction via averaging.",

  "new_outputs_md": "Proposition 11 (Trivialization of the segment LP under Definition 6)\nFor every r \u2265 1 and k \u2265 1, the optimum q(r,k) in Definition 6 satisfies q(r,k) = 1.\n\nProof.\nLet \u03a3 = {1,2,3}. Consider the order-1 Markov chain (X_t) with stationary distribution u(i) = 1/3 for i\u2208\u03a3 and transition matrix P with P(i,i)=0 and P(i,j)=1/2 for j\u2260i. For k \u2265 1, define a distribution p on \u03a3^k by drawing (X_1,\u2026,X_k) according to X_1 \u223c u and X_{t+1} | X_t \u223c P.\n\n(i) Objective value. Because P(i,i)=0, adjacent colors are never equal: P[X_t = X_{t+1}] = 0 for all t. Therefore p assigns probability 1 to the event \u201c\u03c8 has no equal-color adjacencies on edges (t,t+1), t=1..k\u22121,\u201d and the objective equals 1.\n\n(ii) Feasibility (geometry-aware interior invariance). Since u is stationary for P, the process (X_t) is strictly stationary. Fix any geometry (s,\u03b4) and two r-gapped placements \u03c9, \u03c9\u2032 of (s,\u03b4) inside [1..k]. Let C(\u03c9) \u2286 {1,\u2026,k} be the ordered list of core indices of \u03c9 (similarly C(\u03c9\u2032)). Because \u03c9 and \u03c9\u2032 have the same (s,\u03b4), there exists an integer shift \u03c4 such that C(\u03c9\u2032) = C(\u03c9) + \u03c4 (coordinatewise). Strict stationarity implies that the joint law of (X_i)_{i\u2208C(\u03c9)} equals the joint law of (X_{i+\u03c4})_{i\u2208C(\u03c9)} = (X_j)_{j\u2208C(\u03c9\u2032)}. Hence for every core assignment \u03b6, the marginal probability that the cores equal \u03b6 is the same for \u03c9 and \u03c9\u2032. Nonnegativity and normalization of p are immediate. Thus p is feasible with objective value 1, and so q(r,k) \u2265 1. Since the objective is at most 1 for all feasible p, q(r,k)=1.\n\nCorollary 12 (No segment-LP constant-error bound in two-way under Definition 6)\nUnder Definition 6, the segment LP cannot certify any nontrivial bound for two-way algorithms: for all r,k we have q(r,k)=1. Consequently, Corollary 10 specializes to the trivial inequality P_success(C_n) \u2264 1 in the entanglement-allowed regime and gives no constant-error lower bound.\n\nRemark 12.1 (Scope). Proposition 11 does not contradict the soundness of the constraints in Definition 6 for actual r-round algorithms under the symmetry assumptions of Remark 6.1; it shows that these constraints alone are insufficient. To obtain nontrivial upper bounds in the product-state regime, independence across sets with disjoint r-neighborhoods (>2r separation) must be incorporated, which is nonlinear (factorization). In the entanglement-allowed regime, no such independence holds, so segment-based linear constraints of this form cannot lead to q<1.",
