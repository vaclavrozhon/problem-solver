Summary of audit and implications
- Core claim verified: Under Definition 6 (geometry-aware interior placement invariance), the segment LP is too weak in the two-way model. The stationary order-1 Markov chain on Σ = {1,2,3} with no self-loops (P(i→i)=0, P(i→j)=1/2 for j≠i) and stationary initial law u ≡ 1/3 yields, for every k and r, a feasible distribution p on Σ^k with objective value 1. This p assigns probability 1 to internally proper strings (no equal adjacencies), and because the chain is strictly stationary, all single-core and multi-core marginals (for fixed geometry (s,δ)) are invariant under interior translations. If reflection-invariance constraints are also imposed, the witness still works because the chain is reversible (P = P* under u). Thus q(r,k)=1 for all r,k under Definition 6.
- Rigor check of constraints: The multi-core constraints require equality across placements with the same (s,δ) and interior r-buffers. For any two such placements ω,ω′ there is a common transl
