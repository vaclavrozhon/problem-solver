  "progress_md": "Headlines for this round\n- We pivot from the trivialized segment LP (Definition 6) to independence-augmented formulations in the product-state regime, and to ring-level (experiment/\u03c6-LOCAL) arguments in the entanglement-allowed regime.\n- We isolate a simple, checkable linear constraint that excludes the Markov-chain witness once product-state independence is enforced: at any gap \u03b4 \u2265 2r+1, color-equality at the two sites must be 1/3 (under color symmetry), which contradicts the strictly stationary order-1 proper Markov chain\u2019s correlation 1/3 + (2/9)(\u22121/2)^\u03b4.\n- We propose a concrete feasibility test (linear, color-symmetric, pair-independence relaxation) for r = 2 and moderate k that should already force objective < 1, yielding a rigorous certificate in the no-entanglement regime.\n- For the entanglement-allowed regime, we outline a two-way, r = 2 adaptation of the LGR \u201cexperiments\u201d method: construct weighted mixtures of match-at-distance indicators whose expectations must be equal under r-non-signaling locality but separate under properness, certifying constant error. We propose an auditable search plan.\n\nGaps and clarifications in output.md (minor)\n- Theorem 2 (Independence beyond 2r): the current statement and proof are fine; if we later rely on higher-arity independence (for m \u2265 3 windows), note explicitly that the product initial state implies factorization over any collection of disjoint r-buffers by the same argument (pairwise disjoint supports \u21d2 global factorization). Not essential but worth noting for later factorization constraints.\n- Corollary 10 and Proposition 11: now consistent; Proposition 11 makes Corollary 10 vacuous with the current LP. We will add independence-augmented constraints (Track A) to resurrect nontrivial bounds in the product-state setting.\n\nTrack A (product-state, no entanglement): independence-augmented constraints\nIdea A1 (minimal linear independence constraint under color symmetry)\n- Independence premise: For any two cores A, B whose r-neighborhoods are disjoint in the segment (equivalently, inter-core gap \u03b4 \u2265 2r+1), the joint law on the cores must factorize. Under color symmetry (see below), this yields a linear identity for single-site cores:\n  I1(\u03b4): P[X_i = X_{i+\u03b4}] = 1/3, for every interior pair (i, i+\u03b4) with \u03b4 \u2265 2r+1.\n- Why linear: By color symmetry (permutation of {1,2,3}), single-site marginals must be uniform, P[X_t = a] = 1/3 for all a. Factorization then implies P[X_i = X_{i+\u03b4}] = \u2211_a P[X_i=a]P[X_{i+\u03b4}=a] = 3\u00b7(1/3\u00b71/3) = 1/3.\n- Justification for enforcing color symmetry as constraints: The objective (maximizing probability of properness) and all existing placement-equality constraints are invariant under the global action of S3 on colors; hence averaging any feasible solution over S3 yields a color-symmetric feasible solution with the same objective value. It is therefore valid (and can only strengthen the relaxation) to add linear constraints enforcing equal color marginals at all interior positions.\n\nLemma A (Order-1 proper chain violates I1 at any finite separation)\n- Consider the stationary 3-state nearest-neighbor chain with no self-loops (P(i\u2192i) = 0, P(i\u2192j) = 1/2 for j \u2260 i). Then for d \u2265 1:\n  P[X_t = X_{t+d}] = 1/3 + (2/9)(\u22121/2)^d.\n  Proof sketch: The transition matrix has eigenvalues 1 and (\u22121/2) (multiplicity 2). One obtains P^d(i\u2192i) = 1/3 + (2/3)(\u22121/2)^d and P^d(i\u2192j) = 1/3 \u2212 (1/3)(\u22121/2)^d for i \u2260 j. Average over the stationary law to get the stated equality probability. For every finite d, this differs from 1/3, so the chain is not independent at separation d.\n- Consequence: any feasible family supported on fully proper strings and strictly stationary with nontrivial finite-range correlations fails I1 at some \u03b4; imposing I1 (for \u03b4 \u2265 2r+1) cuts off the Markov-chain witness.\n\nFormulation A2 (linear, color-symmetric, pair-independence relaxation)\n- Variables: p_\u03c8 for \u03c8 \u2208 \u03a3^k as in Definition 6.\n- Enforce:\n  \u2022 Color symmetry: For every interior position u, P[X_u = 1] = P[X_u = 2] = P[X_u = 3] = 1/3 (linear constraints in p_\u03c8).\n  \u2022 Placement invariance within fixed geometries (Definition 6, restricted to t = 1 and t = 2 core families): single-core (s = 1), and two-core (s = (1,1)) at gaps \u03b4 \u2208 {2r+1, 2r+2, \u2026}, across all interior translations.\n  \u2022 Independence at large gaps (pair level): For each such \u03b4, impose I1(\u03b4): P[X_i = X_{i+\u03b4}] = 1/3 (as a single linear equality for each \u03b4, using color symmetry).\n  \u2022 Optionally, refine to block-level: For s = 2 cores (length-2 blocks) with gap \u03b4 \u2265 2r+1, enforce P[(block1) = (block2)] = \u2211_{\u03be \u2208 \u03a3^2} P[block1 = \u03be] P[block2 = \u03be]; under color symmetry and single-core uniformity this yields a finite set of linear identities involving diagonal sums of pair-block marginals. (We will start with single-site cores for robustness.)\n- Objective: as before, maximize the probability of internal properness.\n- Claim (target to check computationally): For r = 2 and some moderate k (e.g., 11 \u2264 k \u2264 15), the above linear system has optimum strictly less than 1. Intuition: Full support on proper strings combined with translation invariance of pair laws at large gaps forces equality-probability 1/3 for those pairs, which is incompatible with any measure supported entirely on proper strings satisfying the interior invariances.\n\nAuditable test plan A3 (r = 2, feasibility at objective 1)\n- Fix r = 2. Consider k \u2208 {11, 12, 13, 14, 15}.\n- Build the linear system described in A2 with:\n  \u2022 Single-core invariance (t = 1) and two-core invariance (t = 2) for gaps \u03b4 \u2208 {5,6} (since 2r+1 = 5), across all interior placements.\n  \u2022 Color symmetry constraints yielding uniform marginals.\n  \u2022 Independence equalities I1(5) and optionally I1(6).\n- Solve the LP feasibility with the additional equality \u201cobjective = 1\u201d (i.e., demand probability 1 on proper strings) or, equivalently, check whether any p_\u03c8 supported on proper strings satisfies the linear constraints. If infeasible, the conclusion is: in the product-state regime, objective 1 is impossible already under these (linear) constraints, hence the true optimum q_prod(r,k) < 1.\n- Certificate: Invalidate objective = 1 with a dual ray (Farkas certificate), archiving the precise linear combination of constraints leading to a contradiction with 1{proper}.\n\nWhy a fully proper, translation-invariant measure cannot meet I1 (intuition)\n- Any measure supported on proper strings induces for each finite gap \u03b4 a pair-law P(X_i, X_{i+\u03b4}) which, under interior translation invariance (two-core constraints) and mild mixing, typically deviates from the product measure at \u03b4 finite. The order-1 chain demonstrates the unavoidable alternation: equality-prob oscillates around 1/3 with amplitude (2/9)(1/2)^\u03b4. Imposing P_equal(\u03b4)=1/3 at \u03b4 = 5,6 forces structure incompatible with \u201calways proper\u201d and two-core invariance. The LP feasibility test A3 makes this precise.\n\nExtending A2 to stronger (still linear) independence surrogates\n- Fr\u00e9chet bounds sharpening: For each \u03b4 \u2265 2r+1 and color a, add bounds P[X_i = a, X_{i+\u03b4} = a] \u2208 [max(0, 2/3\u22121), min(1/3, 1/3)] = [0,1/3] with summed diagonal fixed to 1/3. These are necessary consequences of independence and color symmetry, and improve robustness.\n- Multi-gap constraints: Impose I1(\u03b4) for multiple \u03b4 in {5,6,7}. The stationary proper Markov chain fails all of them; a general proper distribution would struggle to satisfy them simultaneously.\n\nTrack B (entanglement allowed): r = 2 ring-level \u201cexperiments\u201d\nIdea B1 (two-way analogue of LGR\u2019s distance-mix experiment)\n- Objective: Construct two \u201cexperiments\u201d (randomized procedures that pick a random node v and a random distance d \u2208 D_1 or D_2 with specified weights, then ask whether colors at v and v+d match) whose expected outcomes must be equal under any r-round non-signaling strategy (by locality and rotation invariance), but differ on any proper 3-coloring of the cycle. Any strictly positive separation yields a constant-error lower bound.\n- Why equality under r-non-signaling? In one-way, LGR exploited that pair distributions at non-adjacent nodes are independent of distance. In two-way, this fails. However, by designing D_1, D_2 and how we select the pair (v, v+d) so that both experiments induce the same law of the r-views seen by the two sites and their r-neighborhoods (including the gap size), the non-signaling principle (Heisenberg localization) enforces equality of the corresponding match probabilities.\n- Candidate construction: r = 2. Choose D_1 and D_2 supported on distances \u2265 3 to avoid adjacency, with mixtures of distances of different parity to exploit alternating behavior of proper colorings (as in LGR\u2019s pair-correlation alternation). Example sketch: Let D_1 put mass on {5,7,9} and D_2 on {6,8,10} with weights tuned so that the multiset of r-neighborhood isomorphism types (including the informed gap-length) seen by the pair in Experiment 1 equals that for Experiment 2. We will solve for weights by equating counts of r-view types.\n- Proper-coloring separation: In any proper 3-coloring of the cycle, P[X_v = X_{v+d}] alternates with parity of d (1/3 \u00b1 c\u00b7(2)^{\u2212d} in long cycles, or exactly computable on finite cycles). Thus an odd\u2013even mixture typically yields a positive bias between the two experiments. If this bias can be bounded away from 0 uniformly in n for some (D_1,D_2), we obtain a constant error bound.\n\nAuditable search plan B2\n- Fix r = 2 and a cycle length n moderately large (e.g., n = 4m + O(1), m \u2273 50). Enumerate all r-view isomorphism types for unordered pairs (u,v) at distance d up to some cap, with the view capturing: local degrees (trivial for cycles), the labeled positions of u,v and their r-neighborhoods, and the explicit value d, all modulo rotation.\n- Construct a linear system requiring that the multiset of view types sampled by Experiment 1 (weights w_1(d)) equals that of Experiment 2 (weights w_2(d)). Solve for nonnegative weights w_1, w_2 supported on a small distance set (e.g., up to 10 or 12). If a feasible pair exists, compute the induced gap between match probabilities on proper 3-colorings. If positive and uniform in n (beyond a threshold), this yields the constant-error bound.\n- If no small-support solution exists, enlarge the distance set and repeat. We expect small supports to suffice, by analogy with LGR\u2019s n = 11 construction.\n\nSmall calculations to support B1\n- In any proper 3-coloring C_n, the probability (over uniform v) that X_v = X_{v+d} equals 1/3 + \u03b1(d,n), with \u03b1(d,n) alternating in parity and |\u03b1(d,n)| \u2265 c\u00b7(2)^{\u2212d} uniformly over n \u2265 2d + 1 (constant c > 0). This follows from the same eigen-analysis as Lemma A, adapted to cycles (edge effects vanish for d \u226a n). Thus mixtures of odd and even d\u2019s yield a nonzero bias.\n\nObstacles and considerations\n- Independence is nonlinear; our linear relaxation (I1) relies on enforcing color symmetry and uniform single marginals. While justified by symmetry of the objective/constraints, we will explicitly note in the solver and certificate that we are working under a color-symmetrized subspace; any bound < 1 then holds a fortiori.\n- For Track B, the critical step is the view-equivalence argument: we must ensure the two experiments induce the same distribution over the r-views of the selected pair (including gap length). This is a finite combinatorial check for given (D_1,D_2) and r.\n\nConcrete next steps (auditable)\n1) Implement LP test A3 (r = 2):\n   - Build constraints for k \u2208 {11,12,13,14,15} with single-core and two-core placement invariance, color symmetry, and I1(5) (and optionally I1(6)).\n   - Check feasibility with objective = 1 (support on proper strings). If infeasible for some k, archive the dual Farkas certificate (linear combination of constraints \u21d2 contradiction).\n   - If feasible persists, augment with I1(6) and/or block-level linear constraints as described.\n2) Document Lemma A (pair-equality formula) and add to notes as a reusable analytic tool for excluding Markov-type correlated constructions when independence constraints are present.\n3) Start the B2 search: generate r = 2 pair-view types on cycles and solve for two mixtures (D_1,D_2) with equal view-type distributions. Begin with distances up to 10. If a feasible pair exists, compute separation on proper colorings and quantify an n-independent \u03b5 > 0.\n4) Optional: formulate a small nonlinear feasibility problem enforcing exact factorization for \u03b4 \u2208 {5,6} (P(A \u2229 B) = P(A)P(B) for all singleton-color events A,B), and solve with MIP for k \u2264 12 to cross-check LP conclusions.\n\nWhy this is promising\n- The linear independence surrogate I1 is extremely low-cost and already incompatible with any fully proper, strictly stationary nearest-neighbor model; combining I1 with translation-invariance constraints should suffice to cut off objective 1. A dual infeasibility certificate would be a clean, auditable product.\n- The r = 2 experiment approach stays squarely within non-signaling/\u03c6-LOCAL reasoning and avoids segment trivialization; it mirrors LGR\u2019s success at r = 1 while respecting that two-way views depend on distance.\n\nDeliverables for the next round\n- Report of LP feasibility tests (A3) including one explicit k with \u201cobjective=1 infeasible\u201d and the dual ray.\n- First candidate (D_1,D_2) for r = 2 with equal r-view distributions, plus the computed separation on proper colorings (or a report that no small-support pair was found and an updated plan)."
