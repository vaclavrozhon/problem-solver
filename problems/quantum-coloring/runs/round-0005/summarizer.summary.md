This round pivots from the trivial segment LP to independence-augmented linear relaxations in the product-state regime and to ring-level (experiment/view) arguments in the entanglement-allowed regime. Key technical move: add the linear, color-symmetric independence constraint I1(δ) that for any pair of single-site cores separated by δ ≥ 2r+1 forces P[X_i = X_{i+δ}] = 1/3. Lemma A shows the stationary nearest-neighbor proper Markov chain violates I1 (its equality probability is 1/3 + (2/9)(-1/2)^δ), so I1 excludes that witness. Formulation A2 (color-symmetric, pair-independence LP) and an auditable test A3 for r = 2 (k in 11..15) are proposed: add single- and two-core placement invariances, color-uniformity, and I1(5) (±I1(6)) and check feasibility with objective = 1; infeasibility yields a Farkas certificate. For the entanglement-allowed case, Track B outlines an r = 2 two-way analogue of LGR: search for two distance-mixtures (D1,D2) whose induced distributions over r-views match (view-equivalence), giving equal expectations under r-non-signaling but different expectations on proper colorings, producing a constant-error separation.
