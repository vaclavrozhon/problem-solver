  "summary_md": "This round pivots from the trivial segment LP to independence-augmented linear relaxations in the product-state regime and to ring-level (experiment/view) arguments in the entanglement-allowed regime. Key technical move: add the linear, color-symmetric independence constraint I1(δ) that for any pair of single-site cores separated by δ ≥ 2r+1 forces P[X_i = X_{i+δ}] = 1/3. Lemma A shows the stationary nearest-neighbor proper Markov chain violates I1 (its equality probability is 1/3 + (2/9)(-1/2)^δ), so I1 excludes that witness. Formulation A2 (color-symmetric, pair-independence LP) and an auditable test A3 for r = 2 (k in 11..15) are proposed: add single- and two-core placement invariances, color-uniformity, and I1(5) (±I1(6)) and check feasibility with objective = 1; infeasibility yields a Farkas certificate. For the entanglement-allowed case, Track B outlines an r = 2 two-way analogue of LGR: search for two distance-mixtures (D1,D2) whose induced distributions over r-views match (view-equivalence), giving equal expectations under r-non-signaling but different expectations on proper colorings, producing a constant-error separation.

  "highlights": [
    "Introduced a simple linear independence surrogate I1(δ): under color symmetry and disjoint r-neighborhoods (δ ≥ 2r+1), P[X_i = X_{i+δ}] must equal 1/3.",
    "Lemma A: the stationary 3-state nearest-neighbor proper Markov chain has P[X_t = X_{t+d}] = 1/3 + (2/9)(−1/2)^d, so it violates I1 for every finite d — I1 cuts off this Markov-chain witness.",
    "Formulation A2: a linear program (variables p_ψ) enforcing color symmetry, single- and two-core placement invariance, and I1(δ) (starting with single-site cores) — intended to force optimum < 1 in product-state regime.",
    "Auditable LP test A3 (r = 2): check feasibility of objective = 1 for k ∈ {11..15} with I1(5) (and optionally I1(6)); infeasibility gives a Farkas dual certificate as a rigorous no-entanglement certificate.",
    "Track B (entanglement allowed): r = 2 ring-level experiments — search for two distance-mixtures (D1,D2) with equal distributions over r-views; equality forced by r-non-signaling but separable on proper colorings yields constant error.",
    "Proposed practical enhancements: add Fréchet bounds and multi-gap I1(δ) constraints, and optionally block-level linear independence identities to strengthen the LP."

  "next_questions": [
    "Implement LP test A3 for r = 2 (k = 11..15) with color symmetry, single- and two-core invariances and I1(5); if infeasible, archive the dual Farkas certificate (linear combination giving contradiction).",
    "Enumerate r = 2 pair-view isomorphism types on cycles (distances up to ~10) and search for small-support mixtures (D1,D2) with equal view-type distributions; if found, compute the induced separation on proper 3-colorings and verify it is n-uniform beyond a threshold.",
    "If LP remains feasible, strengthen A2 by adding I1(6), block-level diagonal identities, and Fréchet bounds or run a small MIP enforcing exact factorization for δ ∈ {5,6} to cross-check conclusions."
