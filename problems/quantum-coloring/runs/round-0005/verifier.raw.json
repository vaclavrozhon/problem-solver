There are several strong ideas here (pair-independence constraints for the product-state regime; ring-level view-matching experiments for r = 2), but a few technical missteps need correction to keep the pipeline rigorous.\\n\\nWhat’s correct and valuable\\n- You correctly identified the weakness of the geometry-aware segment LP (it is trivialized by the stationary no-self-loop Markov chain) and proposed to incorporate independence across disjoint r-neighborhoods in the product-state regime. That is the right direction. \\n- The idea to extract linear consequences of independence via color symmetry is promising as a practical relaxation, and the r = 2 feasibility test plan with I1(δ) for δ ≥ 2r+1 is a sensible starting point.\\n- The ring-level “experiments” approach adapting LGR to two-way is a good high-level strategy: if you can construct two experiments with matched r-view distributions but differing proper-coloring statistics, a constant error lower bound follows.\\n\\nCorrections and cautions\\n1) Markov-chain equality probability. The correct formula for the 3-state no-self-loop chain is P[X_t = X_{t+d}] = 1/3 + (2/3)(−1/2)^d. Your “(2/9)” coefficient is incorrect (it fails at d = 1). This matters when contrasting against I1(δ).\\n\\n2) Block-level independence is not linear. The statement “block-level (length-2) independence yields linear identities under color symmetry” is not correct in general. Independence for blocks gives P[(block1) = ξ, (block2) = ξ] = P[block1 = ξ] P[block2 = ξ] (quadratic). The single-site case linearizes because uniform marginals force a constant (1/3). For blocks, color symmetry does not make the right-hand side constant across ξ, so the constraint remains bilinear.\\n\\n3) Color symmetry and independence: w.l.o.g. is delicate. For the base LP (placement equalities), you can safely average over S3 to enforce color symmetry (objective and constraints are S3-invariant). However, when you add independence-driven constraints, global color-permutation averaging is no longer obviously “without loss” for modeling product-state algorithms because a shared global random permutation can introduce correlations between far-apart sets, potentially destroying independence (unconditionally). Consequently, using color symmetry to linearize independence (I1) does not define a superset of the true product-state feasible set; it defines a subset. Therefore, a proof of infeasibility at objective 1 within this subset does not automatically upper-bound the true product-state optimum unless you separately justify that an optimal product-state strategy can be taken color-symmetric without sacrificing independence properties relevant to the constraints being enforced. If you cannot justify that, the LP certificate would not be sound.\\n\\n4) Proper-coloring pair correlations. The claim “for any proper 3-coloring, P[X_v = X_{v+d}] = 1/3 ± c·2^{-d}” is false. A 2-color alternating proper coloring on even cycles has P_equal(d) = 1 for even d and 0 for odd d (no decay with d). Statements of this type are valid for the uniform measure over proper colorings (or the stationary chain), not for each individual proper coloring. Your B1 separation goal must control the minimum separation over all proper colorings, not just typical ones.\\n\\nGuidance and next steps\\n- Track A (product-state): To maintain rigor, either (i) keep independence in a nonlinear form (e.g., P[X_i=a, X_j=b] = P[X_i=a]P[X_j=b] for δ ≥ 2r+1) and handle feasibility with bilinear constraints (MIP or algebraic), or (ii) identify a symmetry argument ensuring you can restrict attention to color-symmetric product-state strategies without harming feasibility or independence, thereby making I1(δ): P_equal(δ) = 1/3 a sound necessary linear constraint. Absent such a justification, the “I1 + color-symmetry” LP is not a valid relaxation. In practice, I recommend: \\n  • Start with the exact (nonlinear) pair-independence constraints for δ ∈ {2r+1, 2r+2} and k ≤ 12; try MIP infeasibility at objective 1. This is auditable and sound.\\n  • In parallel, pursue a safely linear relaxation: impose full single-site uniformity at each position (this is safe only for the base LP); and add the general identity P_equal(δ) = ∑_a P[X_i=a]P[X_{i+δ}=a] as a separate nonlinear constraint variable-wise. If needed, approximate with a hierarchy (Sherali–Adams/SoS) for small k.\\n  • Keep the Fréchet bounds, but note they follow from marginals alone; they do not capture independence.\\n- Track B (entanglement allowed): Formalize the r-view equivalence lemma you intend to use: if two experiments induce exactly the same distribution over the Heisenberg-evolved effects for the queried event (e.g., “match at distance d”) at depth r, then any r-LOCAL strategy gives the same expectation in both experiments. Then search for small-support (D1, D2) achieving exact view matching at r = 2, distances up to, say, 10–12. For separation, you must certify a uniform positive gap across all proper colorings of C_n (beyond some n0). This reduces to a finite minimization over colorings modulo rotation/reflection for given n; you can compute the minimum difference between the two experiments by dynamic programming or transfer matrices.\\n\\nDeliverables that would be immediately useful\\n- A corrected analytic Lemma: the two-point correlation formula for the 3-state no-self-loop chain (added below). \\n- A formal statement that in the product-state regime, for δ ≥ 2r+1, independence implies P_equal(δ) = ∑_a P[X_i=a]P[X_{i+δ}=a], and, under uniform marginals, P_equal(δ) = 1/3 (added below). \\n- A sound feasibility test at objective 1 using exact pair-independence (nonlinear) for r = 2, k ≤ 12; or a proof that color-symmetric restriction is w.l.o.g. for the independence-augmented model.\\n- For Track B, a precise definition of r-views and a linear system that enforces equality of their distributions for two experiments, followed by a search outcome and a certified lower bound on the proper-coloring separation.\\n\",\"new_notes_md\":\"Addendum: independence-linearization, color symmetry, and corrected chain correlation\\n\\n1) Pair independence at large separations and its linearization\\n- In the product-state regime (no shared entanglement), independence across sets whose r-neighborhoods are disjoint (distance > 2r) implies, for single-site cores at positions i and j with |i − j| ≥ 2r + 1:\\n  P[X_i = a, X_j = b] = P[X_i = a] · P[X_j = b] for all colors a, b.\\n- This yields, for the equality event:\\n  P_equal(i, j) := P[X_i = X_j] = ∑_{a∈{1,2,3}} P[X_i = a] P[X_j = a].\\n- If, in addition, the single-site marginals are uniform, i.e., P[X_u = a] = 1/3 for all a and all interior positions u, then P_equal(i, j) = 1/3. This is the proposed linear identity I1(δ) for δ ≥ 2r + 1.\\n- Caution (soundness): Enforcing uniform marginals (color symmetry) is harmless for the base LP (geometry-aware placement equalities), but combining it with independence-derived constraints needs justification. A global random color-permutation used only for symmetrization can introduce correlations across far-apart sets (breaking unconditional independence). Therefore, unless we prove that restricting to color-symmetric algorithms is w.l.o.g. even under independence constraints, using I1(δ) as a necessary linear condition is not sound. As a safe alternative, either (i) keep the exact (nonlinear) independence equalities, or (ii) prove the w.l.o.g. color-symmetry claim for the product-state model.\\n\\n2) Corrected two-point correlation for the stationary “no self-loop” 3-state chain\\nLet (X_t) be the stationary order-1 Markov chain on {1,2,3} with transition matrix P(i,i) = 0 and P(i,j) = 1/2 for j ≠ i and stationary distribution u ≡ 1/3. Then, for d ≥ 1,\\n  P[X_t = X_{t+d}] = 1/3 + (2/3) (−1/2)^d.\\nThis follows from the spectral decomposition of P (eigenvalues 1, −1/2, −1/2). In particular, P[X_t = X_{t+1}] = 0 and P[X_t = X_{t+2}] = 1/2. Consequently, for any finite d ≥ 1, this chain violates the identity P_equal(d) = 1/3.\\n\\n3) Track A (product-state) implementation notes\\n- Sound feasibility test at objective 1 should include exact (nonlinear) pair independence for δ ∈ {2r+1, 2r+2}, along with placement equalities by geometry. For r = 2 and k ∈ {10, 11, 12}, this should be within reach of a MIP/CP-SAT solver. An infeasibility certificate at value 1 would be decisive.\\n- If you pursue the linearized I1(δ) route, first prove rigorously that restricting to color-symmetric strategies is w.l.o.g. with independence preserved in the relevant sense (i.e., that the resulting distribution still satisfies the imposed independence equalities). Otherwise, any certificate obtained may not upper-bound the true product-state optimum.\\n\\n4) Track B (entanglement allowed) clarifications\\n- r-view equivalence lemma to formalize: If two experiments induce the same distribution over the Heisenberg-evolved effects for the queried event at depth r (as random placements on the cycle), then every r-LOCAL strategy yields equal expectations for the two experiments. Your weight-solving LP should enforce exact equality of the induced multiset of r-view isomorphism types (including gap size if it is part of the view definition).\\n- Separation on proper colorings must be uniform over all proper colorings (for n beyond some threshold). The parity-oscillation intuition is valid for the stationary chain or the uniform measure over proper colorings, but not for each fixed coloring; e.g., the 2-color alternating pattern has P_equal(d) ∈ {0,1} depending on parity. Therefore, after finding (D1, D2) with equal r-views, compute the minimum separation over all proper colorings (e.g., by transfer-matrix enumeration) and certify a positive gap.\\n\\n5) Practical next steps\\n- Product-state: implement the exact pair-independence feasibility test at value 1 for r = 2, k ≤ 12. If infeasible, record the specific contradiction (solver proof log) and the list of constraints used. If feasible, extend δ or add three-core geometry constraints.\\n- Entanglement allowed: enumerate r = 2 pair-view types up to distance 10–12; solve for two mixtures with equal view distributions; compute the minimum separation over proper colorings and report whether a uniform ε > 0 is achieved.\\n\",\"new_notes_append\":\"True\",\"new_outputs_md\":\"New results appended\\n\\nProposition 13 (Pair-equality identity at large separation in the product-state regime)\\nAssume no initial entanglement (product initial state). Let r ≥ 1, and let i, j be two vertices in a path segment whose r-neighborhoods are disjoint (equivalently, |i − j| ≥ 2r + 1). Then, for any r-round two-way LOCAL algorithm, the equality probability satisfies\\n  P[X_i = X_j] = ∑_{a∈{1,2,3}} P[X_i = a] · P[X_j = a].\\nIn particular, if the single-site marginals at i and j are uniform (P[X_i = a] = P[X_j = a] = 1/3 for all a), then P[X_i = X_j] = 1/3.\\n\\nProof.\\nBy Theorem 2 in this file, the outcomes on {i} and {j} are independent because their r-neighborhoods are disjoint. Hence, for any a, b,\\n  P[X_i = a, X_j = b] = P[X_i = a] P[X_j = b].\\nSumming over a = b gives the displayed identity. If the marginals are uniform, the sum is 3 · (1/3) · (1/3) = 1/3.\\n\\nLemma 14 (Two-point correlation for the 3-state no-self-loop chain)\\nLet Σ = {1,2,3}. Consider the stationary order-1 Markov chain (X_t) with stationary distribution u(i) = 1/3 and transition probabilities P(i,i) = 0, P(i,j) = 1/2 for j ≠ i. Then for all integers d ≥ 1,\\n  P[X_t = X_{t+d}] = 1/3 + (2/3)(−1/2)^d.\\n\\nProof.\\nThe transition matrix P has eigenvalues 1 and −1/2 (with multiplicity 2). Diagonalizing P gives, for i ≠ j,\\n  P^d(i,i) = 1/3 + (2/3)(−1/2)^d,   P^d(i,j) = 1/3 − (1/3)(−1/2)^d.\\nUnder the stationary initial law u, we have\\n  P[X_t = X_{t+d}] = ∑_{i} u(i) P^d(i,i) = (1/3) · 3 · [1/3 + (2/3)(−1/2)^d] = 1/3 + (2/3)(−1/2)^d.\\nThis equals 0 at d = 1 and tends monotonically to 1/3 in absolute value with rate (1/2)^d.\\n\\nCorollary 15 (Markov-chain witness violates the pair-equality identity)\\nFor the chain in Lemma 14 and every d ≥ 1,\\n  P[X_t = X_{t+d}] ≠ 1/3.\\nTherefore, for any r ≥ 1 and any δ ≥ 2r + 1, the Markov-chain distributions used in Proposition 11 cannot satisfy the pair-equality identity of Proposition 13 at separation δ (in particular, they cannot satisfy the specialized form P_equal = 1/3 under uniform single-site marginals).\\n\\nRemark.\\nProposition 13 provides a sound linear identity (after imposing uniform marginals) that must be satisfied by any product-state strategy at separations ≥ 2r + 1. Lemma 14 certifies that the order-1 Markov-chain witness (which trivializes the base LP) is excluded as soon as these independence-driven identities are enforced.\\n\",\"new_outputs_append\":\"True\",\"verdict\":\"partial success\"}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"auto","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"VerifierNewSchema","schema_":{"properties":{"feedback_md":{"title":"Feedback Md","type":"string"},"new_notes_md":{"title":"New Notes Md","type":"string"},"new_notes_append":{"title":"New Notes Append","type":"string"},"new_outputs_md":{"title":"New Outputs Md","type":"string"},"new_outputs_append":{"title":"New Outputs Append","type":"string"},"verdict":{"title":"Verdict","type":"string"}},"required":["feedback_md","new_notes_md","new_notes_append","new_outputs_md","new_outputs_append","verdict"],"title":"VerifierNewSchema","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":11614,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":21818,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":18432},"total_tokens":33432},"user":null,"store":true}
