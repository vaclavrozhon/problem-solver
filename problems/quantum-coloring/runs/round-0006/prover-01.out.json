  "progress_md": "Headlines for this round\n- We corrected and consolidated the analytic underpinnings for the product-state regime and adjusted the plan to avoid unsound linearizations. The key shift is to formulate a sound, finite, nonlinear feasibility test (MIQCP/QCQP) at objective value 1 based on a single stationary 6-block distribution, which already encodes: (i) perfect properness on all adjacent edges in the window; (ii) shift-consistency (Kolmogorov consistency for a stationary 1D process); and (iii) exact pair-independence at lag \u03b4 = 5 (the 2r+1 separation for r = 2). This test is strictly necessary for any r-round product-state output and will be attempted with global nonconvex solvers (BARON/Couenne/SCIP-NLP). If infeasible, it yields a clean, auditable contradiction to perfect success.\n- We acknowledge the verifier\u2019s cautions: (1) block-level independence is inherently nonlinear; (2) color-symmetry averaging is not w.l.o.g. under independence constraints; (3) any parity-type intuition about pair equality for each fixed proper coloring is false; (4) ring-level \u201cdistance mix\u201d experiments do not carry over straightforwardly to r = 2 as matching r-views forces equality of expectations for r-local algorithms. We therefore pivot away from linearizations relying on color symmetry and from distance-mix experiments for r = 2 in the near term.\n\nCorrections and clarifications (to be reflected in output.md)\n- Markov-chain two-point correlation. We have already corrected the equality-probability for the stationary 3-state no-self-loop chain to P[X_t = X_{t+d}] = 1/3 + (2/3)(\u22121/2)^d (Lemma 14), which now matches d = 1 (value 0) and d = 2 (value 1/2), and excludes the witness as soon as any lag-\u03b4 pair independence is imposed (Corollary 15).\n- No linear block-level independence. Our earlier suggestion that length-2 block-independence becomes linear under color symmetry is incorrect in general; the independence equalities remain bilinear (products of marginal probabilities) even with symmetric marginals (except in the degenerate single-site P_equal case under uniform marginals). We will not employ such linearizations.\n- Color-symmetry w.l.o.g. is not available once independence constraints are in play. A global random color-permutation can destroy unconditional independence across distant sets. We therefore refrain from imposing color-symmetry constraints in independence-augmented models unless we separately prove their admissibility.\n- View-equivalence experiments for r = 2. Matching the distribution of r-views exactly forces equality of expectations for any r-local Heisenberg-evolved effect (by non-signaling). Hence the r = 1 \u201cdistance mix\u201d trick does not directly extend to r = 2. We do not pursue this path further until/unless we identify a different observable (or sampling scheme) whose r-view distributions can be equalized while still forcing separation on proper colorings.\n\nA sound nonlinear feasibility test for the product-state regime (r = 2)\nGoal. Prove that perfect success (objective = 1) on a long enough segment is impossible under exact independence across disjoint r-neighborhoods (i.e., lag-5 independence), even before invoking amplification. This yields the desired constant-error bound for 2-round two-way LOCAL algorithms without entanglement (by Corollary 3) once a finite k is certified.\n\nKey modeling choice: a single stationary 6-block distribution\n- Variables: For a 1D stationary process (X_t) over \u03a3 = {1,2,3}, introduce a single 6-block distribution t(\u03b6) for \u03b6 \u2208 \u03a3^6. This is interpreted as the common distribution of (X_i,\u2026,X_{i+5}) for all i in the interior of a long segment. Number of variables: 3^6 = 729.\n- Linear constraints:\n  1) Nonnegativity and normalization: t(\u03b6) \u2265 0, \u2211_\u03b6 t(\u03b6) = 1.\n  2) Shift-consistency (Kolmogorov consistency): For all \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a3^5, let M_1(\u03b1) = \u2211_{\u03b6: \u03b6_1..\u03b6_5=\u03b1} t(\u03b6) and M_2(\u03b1) = \u2211_{\u03b6: \u03b6_2..\u03b6_6=\u03b1} t(\u03b6). Impose M_1(\u03b1) = M_2(\u03b1). This enforces stationary consistency of length-5 marginals across overlapping 6-windows.\n  3) Perfect properness on adjacent edges within the window: For j = 1,\u2026,5 and a \u2208 \u03a3, \u2211_{\u03b6: \u03b6_j = \u03b6_{j+1} = a} t(\u03b6) = 0. (No equal adjacent colors on any interior edge in the 6-window.)\n- Nonlinear (bilinear) independence constraints at lag \u03b4 = 5:\n  Let m(a) = \u2211_{\u03b6: \u03b6_1 = a} t(\u03b6) (single-site marginal; stationarity implies the same for position 6), and p(a,b) = \u2211_{\u03b6: \u03b6_1 = a, \u03b6_6 = b} t(\u03b6) (pair marginal across lag 5 within the 6-block).\n  Impose for all a,b \u2208 \u03a3: p(a,b) = m(a) \u00b7 m(b).\n  This encodes exact pair-independence at separation 5 (which is the 2r+1 threshold for r = 2) and is a necessary condition for any product-state r-round output process.\n\nWhy this is sound (and minimalist)\n- Stationarity and shift-consistency: These are necessary in the interior by interior-placement invariance (Definition 6 specialized to single frames and their shifts) and by uniform channels across vertices. Using a single 6-block distribution is the most compact way to enforce both translation invariance and Kolmogorov consistency.\n- Perfect properness: Objective = 1 on sufficiently long segments implies no equal-color adjacencies anywhere; imposing it on every adjacent pair inside the 6-block is necessary.\n- Pair-independence at lag 5: In the product-state regime, independence across sets whose r-neighborhoods are disjoint (Theorem 2; Proposition 13) implies independence of (X_i, X_{i+5}). Since the 6-block covers positions i and i+5, enforcing p(a,b) = m(a) m(b) within the window is necessary.\n- No color-symmetry assumed: We avoid any averaging or symmetry constraints that could invalidate independence.\n- Feasibility at value 1 implies existence of a stationary measure on bi-infinite strings consistent with all constraints (Kolmogorov extension applies under shift-consistency and positivity). Thus, if the MIQCP is infeasible, perfect success is impossible for any product-state r-round process.\n\nPractical MIQCP formulation and solvers\n- Problem size: 729 continuous variables; linear equality constraints: 3^5 shift constraints (243) plus properness constraints (5\u00b73 = 15) plus normalization; nonnegativity; and 3^2 = 9 bilinear equalities p(a,b) \u2212 m(a)m(b) = 0.\n- Solvers: BARON, Couenne (via IPOPT/Bonmin), SCIP-NLP with ANTIGONE or Juniper, or Gurobi/CPLEX with nonconvex quadratic support (MIQCP) can handle this scale. Our target is an infeasibility certificate. If the solver returns feasible solutions, we can inspect them and adjust (e.g., add \u03b4 = 6 constraints by moving to a 7-block with analogous structure) or tighten via additional necessary constraints (e.g., pair-independence for both boundary pairs (1,6) and any extra far-separated pair inside a 7-block).\n- Extension knobs:\n  \u2022 Add lag-6 independence (\u03b4 = 6) by moving to a single 7-block distribution (3^7 = 2187 variables) and enforcing p(1,7) = m(1)m(7).\n  \u2022 Add multi-lag constraints (\u03b4 = 5 and 6) to preclude pathological constructions.\n\nWhy we expect infeasibility\n- The stationary \u201cno self-loop\u201d Markov chain shows that properness alone is easy. However, that chain exhibits nonzero correlations at lag 5: P_equal(5) = 1/3 + (2/3)(\u22121/2)^5 \u2260 \u2211_a m(a)^2 under any nontrivial marginal m(\u00b7) consistent with perfect properness. The MIQCP mandates exact independence at lag 5, which the chain fails, and stationarity/shift-consistency constrain the space of candidates enough that we expect no distribution can satisfy all three: (i) perfect properness for all 5 interior edges; (ii) stationarity with shift-consistency; (iii) lag-5 pair independence.\n\nSoundness boundary (why this suffices for Corollary 3 if infeasible)\n- If the MIQCP is infeasible, then no stationary r-round product-state output process can be perfectly proper on all edges while obeying lag-5 independence. A fortiori, no interior-invariant segment distribution induced by an r-round product-state algorithm can have objective value 1 on a sufficiently long segment. By Corollary 3, this yields a constant-error lower bound and, with independence, exponential decay for cycles with stride k + 2r.\n\nActionable next steps (auditable)\n1) Implement the stationary 6-block MIQCP (r = 2):\n   - Variables: t(\u03b6), \u03b6 \u2208 \u03a3^6.\n   - Linear constraints: nonnegativity, normalization, shift-consistency (243 equalities), properness on 5 interior edges (15 equalities).\n   - Nonlinear constraints: 9 bilinear equalities p(a,b) = m(a)m(b).\n   - Solver: BARON or Couenne; report feasibility status and, if infeasible, the solver\u2019s proof log/statistics for audit.\n2) If 6-block is feasible, move to 7-block with lag-6 independence added; repeat.\n3) If still feasible, add both \u03b4 = 5 and \u03b4 = 6 independence in a single 7-block formulation. If infeasible anywhere, record and archive the exact model file and solver transcript.\n4) (If needed) As a cross-check, attempt to construct an explicit candidate distribution numerically (e.g., via alternating projections) to see whether the constraints can be satisfied approximately; this can guide which additional necessary constraints to add.\n\nSmall gaps or missing justifications in output.md\n- Color symmetry comments. The current output.md correctly avoids using color-symmetry to linearize independence, but it would help to add a short remark stating explicitly that color-symmetry is not w.l.o.g. under independence constraints (cf. our Corrections section), to prevent accidental overuse of symmetry in future modeling.\n- Experiments for r = 2. The text mentions the \u201cexperiments\u201d route only in a high-level remark; given the obstacles identified (equalizing r-view distributions forces equality of expectations), we suggest adding a note that the r = 1 distance-mix method does not directly carry to r = 2 two-way, thereby motivating our focus on product-state MIQCP.\n\nWhy this plan is promising\n- The 6/7-block stationary MIQCP precisely encodes only necessary conditions (stationarity, properness, and exact lag-independence) and avoids any extraneous modeling assumptions. A single-block variable drastically reduces dimensionality while preserving shift-consistency and interior invariance. If infeasibility at objective = 1 is certified, it yields a clean lower bound in the product-state regime compatible with our amplification template.\n\nAppendix: explicit constraints summary for the 6-block MIQCP\n- Variables: t(\u03b6), \u03b6 \u2208 \u03a3^6.\n- For \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a3^5: \u2211_{\u03b6: \u03b6_1..\u03b6_5=\u03b1} t(\u03b6) \u2212 \u2211_{\u03b6: \u03b6_2..\u03b6_6=\u03b1} t(\u03b6) = 0.\n- For j = 1,\u2026,5 and a \u2208 \u03a3: \u2211_{\u03b6: \u03b6_j = \u03b6_{j+1} = a} t(\u03b6) = 0.\n- \u2211_\u03b6 t(\u03b6) = 1; t(\u03b6) \u2265 0.\n- For a \u2208 \u03a3: m(a) = \u2211_{\u03b6: \u03b6_1 = a} t(\u03b6).\n- For a,b \u2208 \u03a3: p(a,b) = \u2211_{\u03b6: \u03b6_1 = a, \u03b6_6 = b} t(\u03b6) and enforce p(a,b) \u2212 m(a)m(b) = 0.\n- (Optional convenience) Eliminate p(\u00b7,\u00b7) by writing constraints directly as \u2211_{\u03b6: \u03b6_1=a, \u03b6_6=b} t(\u03b6) = (\u2211_{\u03b6: \u03b6_1=a} t(\u03b6)) (\u2211_{\u03b6: \u03b6_1=b} t(\u03b6)).\n\nWe will proceed to implement item (1) immediately and report feasibility status and solver certificates in the next round."
