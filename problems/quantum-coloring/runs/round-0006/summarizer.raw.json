The team formulated a single stationary 6-block MIQCP (729 variables) whose linear constraints enforce shift-consistency and interior properness, and whose 9 bilinear equalities enforce exact pair-independence at lag δ = 5 — a necessary condition for any r=2 product-state perfect output. Key modelling fixes: independence is inherently bilinear (no linearization via color-symmetry) and the r=1 distance-mix trick does not extend to r=2. The stationary no-self-loop Markov chain has two-point correlation P[X_t = X_{t+d}] = 1/3 + (2/3)(−1/2)^d, so it violates lag-5 independence and motivates expectation of MIQCP infeasibility. Action plan: implement the 6-block MIQCP in global nonconvex solvers (BARON/Couenne/SCIP-NLP), escalate to 7-block if needed, and archive solver certificates if infeasible.
