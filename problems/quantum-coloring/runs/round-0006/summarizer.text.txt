  "summary_md": "This round corrected analytic foundations and pivoted to a sound nonlinear feasibility test for the product-state r=2 regime. The team formulated a single stationary 6-block MIQCP (729 variables) whose linear constraints enforce shift-consistency and interior properness, and whose 9 bilinear equalities enforce exact pair-independence at lag δ = 5 — a necessary condition for any r=2 product-state perfect output. Key modelling fixes: independence is inherently bilinear (no linearization via color-symmetry) and the r=1 distance-mix trick does not extend to r=2. The stationary no-self-loop Markov chain has two-point correlation P[X_t = X_{t+d}] = 1/3 + (2/3)(−1/2)^d, so it violates lag-5 independence and motivates expectation of MIQCP infeasibility. Action plan: implement the 6-block MIQCP in global nonconvex solvers (BARON/Couenne/SCIP-NLP), escalate to 7-block if needed, and archive solver certificates if infeasible.

  "highlights": [
    "Formulated a sound stationary single-6-block MIQCP for r=2: 729 variables, 243 shift-consistency equalities, 15 adjacency properness equalities, normalization/nonnegativity, and 9 bilinear independence equalities p(a,b)=m(a)m(b).",
    "Independence across r-neighborhoods remains bilinear even under symmetric marginals; color-symmetry averaging is not w.l.o.g. once independence constraints are present, so prior linearizations were unsound and have been abandoned.",
    "Corrected two-point correlation for the 3-state no-self-loop Markov chain: P[X_t=X_{t+d}] = 1/3 + (2/3)(−1/2)^d (matches d=1 and d=2). This chain fails lag-5 independence and thus cannot serve as a witness for MIQCP feasibility.",
    "Soundness claim: infeasibility of the 6-block MIQCP rules out any stationary r=2 product-state process achieving objective=1 on long segments, which yields the desired constant-error lower bound via Corollary 3.",
    "Practical plan: try global nonconvex solvers (BARON/Couenne/SCIP-NLP) to obtain an infeasibility certificate; if feasible, move to 7-block (add δ=6) or include multiple-lag constraints to eliminate pathologies.",

    "Implement the 6-block MIQCP exactly as specified and run global nonconvex solvers (BARON, Couenne, SCIP-NLP). Report feasibility status and attach the solver transcript or infeasibility certificate for audit.",
    "If the 6-block MIQCP is feasible, construct and run a 7-block MIQCP with δ=6 independence (and/or both δ=5 and δ=6) to further constrain pathological solutions; report outcomes and solver logs.",
    "If feasibility persists, attempt numerical approximate constructions (e.g., alternating projections) to identify near-feasible structures and suggest additional necessary constraints to add to the model."
