Your pivot to a finite, stationary single-block feasibility test (MIQCP/QCQP) that encodes (i) perfect properness on the interior edges; (ii) shift-consistency (stationarity); and (iii) exact pair-independence at separation 2r+1 is sound and well-motivated. For r = 2, the 6-block (length L = 2r+2 = 6) formulation captures exactly the pair-independence constraint at lag 5 that any product-state 2-round output must satisfy (Theorem 2 in output.md). The corrected two-point formula for the no-self-loop 3-state chain is correct and useful: it certifies that the chain cannot satisfy lag-5 independence and thus cannot witness feasibility at value 1 once independence is enforced.\\n\\nRigor checks and minor corrections.\\n- Stationarity via a single 6-block distribution: Your shift-consistency constraints M1(α) = M2(α) for all α ∈ Σ^5 are exactly the Kolmogorov (sliding-window) consistency needed to define a stationary order-5 process with the prescribed 6-block marginals. We add a formal extension lemma to output.md to justify this rigorously and to make your modeling auditable.\\n- Pair-independence at lag 5: For r = 2, N_r({i}) and N_r({i+5}) are disjoint on the cycle/line, so independence of X_i and X_{i+5} holds in the product-state regime (Theorem 2). Imposing p(a,b) = m(a)m(b) for the (1,6) coordinates in the 6-block is therefore necessary. Because the 6-block is common across all interior positions by stationarity, this enforces independence at lag 5 globally.\\n- Properness constraints: Requiring t(ζ) = 0 whenever ζ_j = ζ_{j+1} for some j = 1,…,5 is exactly what “objective = 1” within the window means; this is the correct way to encode perfect properness as feasibility.\\n- Color symmetry: Your caution is correct—global color-permutation symmetrization can destroy unconditional independence across distant sets. We add a remark in output.md to flag this explicitly.\\n\\nScope and sufficiency. The 6-block test enforces only a subset of the independence that the product-state model guarantees; it is still necessary, hence any infeasibility is decisive. If 6-block is feasible, moving to a 7-block to add lag-6 independence (and, if needed, both lag-5 and lag-6 together) is the right escalation. Triple independence (e.g., positions 1,6,11) is also valid in the product-state regime and would require an 11-block; keep this as a later knob if simpler pair constraints do not already yield infeasibility.\\n\\nValue triage. The main contributions this round are: (1) a clean, sound MIQCP formulation at L=6 for r=2; (2) clear abandonment of unsound linearizations; (3) corrections to the chain’s correlation formula. These are meaningful steps, though not yet a contradiction or bound. We capture the modeling in notes and add two rigorous structural results to output.md: (i) an extension lemma from shift-consistent L-block marginals to a stationary process; (ii) a single-block necessary-conditions proposition for product-state outputs (general r), plus a corollary tying MIQCP infeasibility to a constant-error lower bound via our amplification template.\\n\\nConcrete next steps (actionable):\\n1) Implement the L = 6 MIQCP as stated; use BARON/Couenne/SCIP-NLP. Archive the exact model and solver logs. If infeasible, we immediately obtain a constant-error bound (Corollary below) and can proceed to quantify ε by maximizing the properness probability under the same constraints.\\n2) If feasible, tighten progressively: (a) move to L = 7 and enforce both lag-5 and lag-6 independence; (b) if still feasible, consider L = 8–9 adding additional necessary constraints (e.g., independence of a far pair internal to the larger window), or jump to triple independence at L = 11.\\n3) In parallel, add an optimization variant: maximize the probability of the “all 5 interior edges proper” event under the same constraints to get an explicit q < 1 if infeasible at value 1 fails. Nonconvex solvers can still handle this scale.\\n4) Exploratory combinatorics: analyze the increment process S_t = X_{t+1} − X_t (mod 3) with S_t ∈ {±1}; independence at lag 5 forces conditions on the 5-step sum of S’s mod 3. This may yield an analytic contradiction without computation, or suggest extra necessary constraints to add to the MIQCP.\\n5) Keep color-symmetry out of the model unless you separately prove it preserves the independence equalities you enforce.\\n\\nWe append the formal single-block reduction and Kolmogorov/Markov extension lemmas to output.md so the MIQCP pipeline is fully justified and citable.\",\"new_notes_md\":\"Stationary single-block MIQCP for r = 2 (product-state, two-way)\\n\\n- Block length L = 2r + 2 = 6.

Independence at separation 2r+1 follows from Theorem 2. If, on a sufficiently long segment, the interior 5 edges of a 6-block are proper with probability 1, then the 6-block marginal t assigns zero to any ζ with ζ_j = ζ_{j+1}. Hence any such algorithm induces t feasible for the MIQCP above. Conversely, any t satisfying the linear equalities is extendable to a stationary order-5 process with 6-block marginal t (Kolmogorov/Markov extension), so infeasibility certifies impossibility of perfect interior properness at r = 2 in the product-state regime.\\n\\nEscalation knobs (if L = 6 is feasible):\\n- Enforce lag-6 independence by moving to L = 7 and adding ∑_{ζ: ζ_1=a, ζ_7=b} t(ζ) = (∑_{ζ: ζ_1=a} t(ζ))(∑_{ζ: ζ_1=b} t(ζ)). Both lag-5 and lag-6 are necessary in the product-state model.\\n- For stronger constraints, eventually consider triple independence (e.g., positions 1,6,11) requiring L = 11.\\n\\nNumerical plan:\\n- Solvers: BARON, Couenne/Bonmin, SCIP-NLP. Archive model files and solver logs. If infeasible at L = 6, immediately use amplification (stride k + 2r) to conclude a constant-error bound (see Corollary below in output.md). If feasible, switch to an optimization variant to upper-bound the maximum properness probability (< 1) numerically.\\n\\nCautions reiterated:\\n- Do not impose color symmetry when independence constraints are active; a global color-permutation randomization can destroy unconditional independence across distant sets.\\n- The Markov-chain witness p_equal(d) = 1/3 + (2/3)(−1/2)^d shows why the base (linear) segment LP is vacuous but is excluded as soon as any lag-5 independence is enforced.\\n\\nAnalytic angle (optional):\\n- Let S_t = X_{t+1} − X_t (mod 3) ∈ {±1}.

Let L := 2r + 2. Consider a uniform r-round LOCAL algorithm on a cycle C_n with product initial state ⊗_{v∈V} ρ (identical local marginals). Let (X_t)_{t∈ℤ/nℤ} be the output colors. Define t ∈ Δ(Σ^L) to be the common distribution of any contiguous L-block (X_i,…,X_{i+L−1}); by rotation invariance this is well defined. Then t satisfies:\\n(i) Nonnegativity and normalization: t(ζ) ≥ 0 and ∑_ζ t(ζ) = 1.\\n(ii) Shift-consistency: For all α ∈ Σ^{L−1}, letting M_1(α) = ∑_{ζ: ζ_1..ζ_{L−1}=α} t(ζ) and M_2(α) = ∑_{ζ: ζ_2..ζ_L=α} t(ζ), we have M_1(α) = M_2(α).\\n(iii) Perfect properness on the L − 1 interior edges, whenever it holds in the algorithm: If the algorithm achieves P[ζ_j ≠ ζ_{j+1} for all j = 1,…,L−1] = 1 on contiguous L-blocks, then t(ζ) = 0 for every ζ with ζ_j = ζ_{j+1} for some j ∈ {1,…,L−1}.\\n(iv) Lag-(2r+1) pair-independence at the block ends: Let m(a) = ∑_{ζ: ζ_1=a} t(ζ) and p(a,b) = ∑_{ζ: ζ_1=a, ζ_L=b} t(ζ). Then, for all a,b ∈ Σ, p(a,b) = m(a) m(b).\\n\\nProof.\\n- (i) is immediate.\\n- (ii) Rotation invariance (strict stationarity) of (X_t) implies the (L−1)-block marginals are equal when shifted by one, i.e., M_1(α) = M_2(α).\\n- (iii) If P[ζ_j ≠ ζ_{j+1} for all j] = 1 on contiguous L-blocks, then for each fixed j, P[ζ_j = ζ_{j+1}] = 0, which means ∑_{ζ: ζ_j = ζ_{j+1}} t(ζ) = 0. Hence t has support only on internally proper words.\\n- (iv) For any i, the r-neighborhoods of {i} and {i + (2r+1)} are disjoint. By Theorem 2 (independence beyond 2r in the product-state regime), X_i and X_{i + (2r+1)} are independent. Therefore, for all a,b, P[X_i=a, X_{i+(2r+1)}=b] = P[X_i=a] P[X_{i+(2r+1)}=b]. Identifying t’s (1,L) marginal with this pair law (by stationarity) gives p(a,b) = m(a)m(b).\\n\\nRemark 16.1 (Color symmetry is not w.l.o.g. under independence constraints)\\nAveraging a feasible strategy by a random global color permutation can destroy unconditional independence across distant sets. Hence one should not impose color-symmetry constraints in models that also enforce independence equalities, unless admissibility is proved separately.\\n\\nLemma 17 (Kolmogorov/Markov extension from shift-consistent L-block marginals)\\nLet L ≥ 2 and Σ finite. Suppose t ∈ Δ(Σ^L) satisfies nonnegativity, normalization, and the shift-consistency equalities M_1(α) = M_2(α) for all α ∈ Σ^{L−1}. Then there exists a strictly stationary process (X_t)_{t∈ℤ} on Σ whose L-block marginal equals t. Moreover, the process can be taken to be a stationary Markov chain of order L−1 on the state space Σ^{L−1}.\\n\\nProof.\\nDefine weights on (L−1)-blocks by μ(α) := M_1(α) = M_2(α). For any pair of (L−1)-blocks α,β that overlap on L−2 symbols (i.e., α_2..α_{L−1} = β_1..β_{L−2}), define a transition probability K(α→β) by\\n  K(α→β) := t(ζ) / μ(α),\\nwhere ζ ∈ Σ^L is the unique concatenation with ζ_1..ζ_{L−1} = α, ζ_2..ζ_L = β. If μ(α) = 0, leave K(α→·) arbitrary (those states are transient). Shift-consistency implies ∑_{β} K(α→β) = 1 and stationarity of μ: ∑_{α} μ(α) K(α→β) = μ(β). Hence μ is a stationary distribution for the order-(L−1) Markov chain on Σ^{L−1} with kernel K. Let (Y_t) be this chain at stationarity and set X_t := (Y_t)_{L−1} (the last symbol). One checks directly that (X_t,…,X_{t+L−1}) has law t for every t, yielding a strictly stationary process with the desired L-block marginal.\\n\\nCorollary 18 (Implication of MIQCP infeasibility for r = 2)\\nLet r = 2 and L = 6. Consider the MIQCP that seeks t ∈ Δ(Σ^6) satisfying the linear constraints of Proposition 16 (i)–(iii) and the bilinear lag-5 independence equalities (iv). If this MIQCP is infeasible, then no uniform 2-round LOCAL algorithm with product initial state can achieve P[all 5 interior edges of a contiguous 6-block are proper] = 1 on the cycle. Consequently, there exists q < 1 and k ≥ 6 such that the success probability on C_n obeys P_success(C_n) ≤ q^{⌊n/(k+2r)⌋} by Corollary 3 (exponential amplification without entanglement).\\n\\nProof.\\nIf an algorithm achieved perfect interior properness with probability 1 on contiguous 6-blocks, Proposition 16 would produce a feasible t, contradicting infeasibility. The amplification claim then follows from Corollary 3 once any finite k and q < 1 are certified (e.g., by optimizing the same constraints or by extending the infeasibility to a slightly larger window that yields an explicit q).\\n\",\"new_outputs_append\":\"True\",\"verdict\":\"partial success\"}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"auto","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"VerifierNewSchema","schema_":{"properties":{"feedback_md":{"title":"Feedback Md","type":"string"},"new_notes_md":{"title":"New Notes Md","type":"string"},"new_notes_append":{"title":"New Notes Append","type":"string"},"new_outputs_md":{"title":"New Outputs Md","type":"string"},"new_outputs_append":{"title":"New Outputs Append","type":"string"},"verdict":{"title":"Verdict","type":"string"}},"required":["feedback_md","new_notes_md","new_notes_append","new_outputs_md","new_outputs_append","verdict"],"title":"VerifierNewSchema","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":12989,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":18628,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":15040},"total_tokens":31617},"user":null,"store":true}
