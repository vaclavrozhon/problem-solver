{"progress_md":"Headlines for this round\n- We concretize the r = 2 product-state feasibility test as a compact MIQCP on proper 6-words (3·2^5 = 96 variables instead of 3^6 = 729) with explicit constraint counts, and give a minimal, auditable recipe to implement and certify infeasibility. We also outline a 7-block (L = 7) escalation that enforces both lag-5 and lag-6 independence, and argue why these two lags are the only nontrivial pair-independence constraints available within a single block for r = 2.\n- We add a useful reduction: represent the 6-block variables by increment sequences S_t ∈ {±1} and record combinatorial counts by end-point residue Δ ∈ {0,±1}, which can be used as linear statistics to sanity-check solver outputs and to derive necessary equalities implied by independence.\n- We point out a small gap to tighten in output.md Corollary 18: to turn infeasibility-at-1 into an explicit quantitative bound q < 1, one should solve an optimization variant (maximize the 5-edge properness probability under the same constraints) and record its optimum as q.\n\nIdeas and modeling details (towards an auditable MIQCP)\n- Proper 6-words enumeration. Any proper 6-word ζ ∈ Σ^6 is uniquely described by (X_1 = a, S_1,…,S_5) where S_j ∈ {±1} encodes X_{j+1} = X_j + S_j (mod 3) and S_j ≠ 0 encodes properness. Hence the proper 6-words are exactly 3 · 2^5 = 96, and t(ζ) = 0 for all other 729 − 96 words. We strongly recommend enumerating these 96 words as the support and declaring a variable p(a,s) for each pair (a ∈ Σ, s ∈ {±1}^5); all sums below are then finite over this set. This reduces scale and solver branching.\n- Shift-consistency (stationarity). For α ∈ Σ^5, the length-5 marginal bound at positions 1..5 equals that at positions 2..6. In the 96-variable encoding, this amounts to linear equalities equating the probability of any fixed 5-word at (1..5) to the same 5-word at (2..6). Counting constraints: there are 3^5 = 243 such equalities; many are vacuous (any 5-word with equal adjacencies has zero mass by properness), but we keep them for generality.\n- Single-site marginals (optional explicit form). Although implied by shift-consistency, for numerical robustness and audit, add linear equalities that all single-site marginals are equal across positions 1..6; in the 6-block formulation this is just 3·(6−1)=15 redundant equalities.\n- Independence at lag 5 (positions 1 and 6). In the 96-variable encoding, define m(a) := ∑_{s} p(a,s), and p(a,b) := ∑_{s: a + Σ s ≡ b (mod 3)} p(a,s). Enforce the nine bilinear equalities p(a,b) = m(a) m(b) for all a,b ∈ Σ. These nine constraints are the only nontrivial pair-independence relations valid within a 6-block for r = 2. (Justification: for r = 2, the only pair of sites in {1,…,6} whose 2-neighborhoods are disjoint is {1,6}. Every other pair shares at least one site in their 2-neighborhoods; see the neighborhood spans below.)\n  • N_2({1}) = {1,2,3}; N_2({6}) = {4,5,6} on a line-indexed block; they are disjoint.\n  • Any other pair {i,j} with 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 6 has j − i ≤ 4 ⇒ N_2({i}) ∩ N_2({j}) ≠ ∅.\n- Constraint counts and sizes. With variables p(a,s) over 96 support atoms:\n  • Nonnegativity (96) and normalization (1).\n  • Properness is built in by support restriction; no extra equalities needed for ζ_j ≠ ζ_{j+1}.\n  • Shift-consistency equalities: up to 243 linear (many redundant), plus optional 15 single-site equalities.\n  • Lag-5 independence: 9 bilinear equalities.\n  This is a compact MIQCP: roughly 96 variables, ~260 linear equalities/inequalities, and 9 bilinear equalities.\n\nCombinatorial sanity checks (increment-sum residue counts)\n- For any fixed starting color a, the end color b ∈ Σ after 5 steps depends only on the residue Δ ≡ Σ_{j=1}^5 S_j (mod 3): b ≡ a + Δ (mod 3). The number of increment sequences yielding each residue is independent of a:\n  • c_0 := |{s ∈ {±1}^5 : Σ s ≡ 0 (mod 3)}| = 10 (either one −1 and four +1, or four −1 and one +1),\n  • c_{+1} = c_{−1} := |{s : Σ s ≡ ±1 (mod 3)}| = 11.\n  These counts provide a simple check on any candidate t: if the solver reports exact independence with m, then aggregated frequencies by residue should match the bilinear target m(a)m(b) totals once mapped by Δ.\n- We do not assume that increments are i.i.d. or unbiased; the residue counts are only combinatorial support sizes. However, they give a helpful oracle to diagnose trivial bugs (e.g., if summed probabilities over residue-classes do not match the independence target totals m(a)m(b)).\n\nEscalation to L = 7 (enforcing both lag 5 and lag 6 independence)\n- For r = 2, independence holds for any pair of sites whose graph-distance ≥ 5. Within 7 sites, the pairs (1,6) and (1,7) both satisfy this. Hence, at L = 7 we can add another 9 bilinear equalities enforcing independence for (X_1, X_7).\n- We recommend the following staged plan: (i) attempt L = 6; if feasible, (ii) move to L = 7 and enforce both lag-5 and lag-6 independence; if still feasible, (iii) consider L = 8 or 9 to add an additional disjoint far pair internal to the window, or jump to L = 11 to encode triple independence of sites {1,6,11} (all pairwise distances = 5).\n\nOptimization variant for an explicit q < 1 (to tighten Corollary 18)\n- As noted by the verifier, Corollary 18 certifies impossibility of perfect properness in 6-blocks if the MIQCP is infeasible. To extract a quantitative bound, we propose solving the nonconvex optimization variant: maximize P[ζ_j ≠ ζ_{j+1} for j = 1,…,5] under the same constraints (i)–(iv). The optimum, denoted q_6, directly yields a constant-error bound with stride k = 6 + 2r = 10 (in the no-entanglement regime) via Corollary 3. If the optimum is strictly less than 1, we record (r=2, k=6, q=q_6) as a certified bound.\n- Practicality: with the 96-variable encoding, the objective simplifies to ∑_{(a,s)} p(a,s) = 1 (when perfect properness), but for the optimization variant we lift the support to all 3^6 blocks and keep the properness indicator in the objective. Alternatively, one can keep the 96 support but relax independence into inequalities to detect how far from 1 we can get; we prefer the direct optimization over the full alphabet for clean interpretability.\n\nToy contradiction heuristics (why we expect infeasibility already at L = 6)\n- For any stationary process with zero adjacent equalities, the increment representation forces X_{t+5} ≡ X_t + Σ_{j=0}^4 S_{t+j} (mod 3). Lag-5 independence requires the distribution of the modular sum Σ_{j=0}^4 S_{t+j} to be independent of X_t and to induce the same marginal m on X_{t+5}. In particular, for any a, the vector (P[Σ≡0|X_t=a], P[Σ≡1|X_t=a], P[Σ≡2|X_t=a]) must equal (m(a), m(a+1), m(a+2)) up to cyclic shift. Combined with shift-consistency over length-5 blocks, this places strong linear constraints on the 5-block marginals which are difficult to satisfy simultaneously with perfect interior properness (these constraints are encoded implicitly in the MIQCP).\n- In the order-1 Markov special case with no self-loops, independence at lag 5 implies P^5 has all rows equal to m, which forces the non-Perron eigenvalues to be zero; no such nonnegative stochastic matrix with zeros on the diagonal exists. While our MIQCP allows non-Markov order 5 processes, this calculation motivates why lag-5 independence plus perfect properness is likely impossible already at L = 6.\n\nObstacles and why we defer a fully analytic contradiction\n- The increment-sum residue argument shows all three residues are combinatorially possible with 5 steps; hence residue-based counting alone does not preclude independence. A direct analytic contradiction seems to require exploiting the full 6-block sliding consistency; we therefore prioritize a solver-based infeasibility certificate.\n\nNext steps (checkable and auditable)\n1) Implement the 96-variable MIQCP (L = 6):\n   - Variables p(a,s) on proper 6-words; nonnegativity and normalization.\n   - Shift-consistency across positions 1..5 and 2..6; optional explicit single-site equalities.\n   - Lag-5 independence for (X_1, X_6): ∑_{s: a+Σs≡b} p(a,s) = (∑_s p(a,s))(∑_{a′,s′: a′=b} p(a′,s′)).\n   - Solver: BARON, Couenne/Bonmin, or SCIP-NLP (nonconvex). Archive model file and solver log. Record either an infeasibility proof or a feasible solution.\n2) If feasible, escalate to L = 7 and add the independent pair (X_1, X_7) equalities (another 9 bilinear constraints). Repeat step (1).\n3) If infeasible at value 1, run the optimization variant to compute q_6 < 1 under the same constraints; record (r=2, k=6, q_6). Add the optimization statement to output.md to strengthen Corollary 18 quantitatively.\n4) Cross-checks: implement the residue-count sanity checks on any solver solution; verify single-site marginals coincide across positions; verify that pair counts match independence totals.\n5) Optional escalation: if L = 7 remains feasible at value 1, consider L = 11 and triple independence for sites {1,6,11}; or strengthen with linear necessary inequalities derived from Fréchet bounds for the (X_1,X_6) pair (diagonal sums and marginal intervals), though these are implied by the bilinear equalities at feasibility.\n\nGaps or clarifications to tighten in output.md\n- Corollary 18 (quantitative bound). Add a sentence that to obtain an explicit q < 1, we solve the nonconvex optimization variant maximizing the probability of the event “all L−1 interior adjacencies are proper” under constraints (i)–(iv), and denote the optimum q_L. This produces a certified (r,k=q-dependent) bound via Corollary 3.\n- Numerical reproducibility. It may help to state explicitly that the 6-block MIQCP can be reduced to 96 variables by restricting to proper 6-words, with 9 bilinear independence constraints, and ~243 sliding equalities, to guide independent verification.\n\nReferences for this round\n- Structural MIQCP: output.md Proposition 16 (single-block reduction), Lemma 17 (Kolmogorov/Markov extension), Corollary 18 (implication for lower bounds).\n- Independence thresholds and φ-LOCAL discussions: 2403.01903 (Akbari et al. 2024), quantum.pdf (Gavoille–Kosowski–Markiewicz 2009).\n"}
