  "summary_md": "This round concretizes the r=2 feasibility test as an auditable MIQCP on \u201cproper\u201d 6-words: represent each proper 6-word by (a,S_1..S_5) with S_j\u2208{\u00b11}, yielding 3\u00b72^5=96 atoms and variables p(a,s). The model uses stationarity (shift-consistency) equalities (up to 243 linear constraints), normalization and nonnegativity, and nine bilinear equalities enforcing lag-5 independence (X_1 \u27c2 X_6). Useful combinatorial checks were added: the 5-step increment-sum residues have counts c_0=10, c_{\u00b11}=11 which map start a to end b via b\u2261a+\u0394 (mod 3) and are handy sanity checks on solver outputs. The note explains why within L=6 the only nontrivial pair-independence is (1,6) (N_2({1}) and N_2({6}) disjoint), and recommends escalation to L=7 to add independence for (1,7). To get a quantitative bound q<1 (tightening Corollary 18) the author advises solving an optimization variant (maximize interior properness probability) and recording the optimum q_6. Solver candidates: BARON, Couenne/Bonmin, SCIP-NLP. Files relied on: prover-01.out.json, output.md. Verifier verdict: partial success.",
  "highlights": [
    "Proper-6-word reduction: use 96 support atoms p(a,s) with S_j\u2208{\u00b11} (3\u00b72^5=96) to dramatically reduce problem size vs 3^6=729.",
    "Constraint summary: 96 nonnegativity, 1 normalization, up to ~243 shift-consistency linear equalities (plus optional 15 single-site), and 9 bilinear equalities encoding X_1\u22a5X_6 (lag-5).",
    "Residue-count sanity checks: counts of increment-sum residues over 5 steps are c_0=10 and c_{\u00b11}=11; these give linear aggregate checks linking p(a,s) to marginal targets m(a)m(b).",
    "Structural justification: for r=2 the only disjoint 2-neighborhood pair inside 6 sites is (1,6); hence lag-5 independence yields the only nontrivial bilinear equalities at L=6. Escalation to L=7 adds another 9 bilinear equalities for (1,7).",
    "To obtain an explicit q<1 (strengthen Corollary 18) one must solve the nonconvex optimization variant (maximize properness probability under same constraints) and record the optimum q_6; infeasibility at value 1 alone is not enough to publish a numeric q."

  "next_questions": [
    "Implement the 96-variable MIQCP (variables p(a,s)), run a nonconvex solver (BARON/Couenne/Bonmin/SCIP-NLP), archive the model and solver log, and produce either an infeasibility certificate or a feasible solution plus residue-check diagnostics.",
    "If feasible at L=6, escalate to L=7 adding independence equalities for (X_1,X_7); re-run and archive results. If still feasible, consider L=8/9 or L=11 (for triple independence {1,6,11}).",
    "Run the optimization variant (maximize P[all 5 interior adjacencies proper]) under the same constraints to compute q_6; record q_6 and add the optimization statement to output.md to make Corollary 18 quantitative."
