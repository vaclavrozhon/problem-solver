The model uses stationarity (shift-consistency) equalities (up to 243 linear constraints), normalization and nonnegativity, and nine bilinear equalities enforcing lag-5 independence (X_1 ⟂ X_6). Useful combinatorial checks were added: the 5-step increment-sum residues have counts c_0=10, c_{±1}=11 which map start a to end b via b≡a+Δ (mod 3) and are handy sanity checks on solver outputs. The note explains why within L=6 the only nontrivial pair-independence is (1,6) (N_2({1}) and N_2({6}) disjoint), and recommends escalation to L=7 to add independence for (1,7). To get a quantitative bound q<1 (tightening Corollary 18) the author advises solving an optimization variant (maximize interior properness probability) and recording the optimum q_6.
