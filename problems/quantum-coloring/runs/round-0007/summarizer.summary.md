This round concretizes the r=2 feasibility test as an auditable MIQCP on “proper” 6-words: represent each proper 6-word by (a,S_1..S_5) with S_j∈{±1}, yielding 3·2^5=96 atoms and variables p(a,s). The model uses stationarity (shift-consistency) equalities (up to 243 linear constraints), normalization and nonnegativity, and nine bilinear equalities enforcing lag-5 independence (X_1 ⟂ X_6). Useful combinatorial checks were added: the 5-step increment-sum residues have counts c_0=10, c_{±1}=11 which map start a to end b via b≡a+Δ (mod 3) and are handy sanity checks on solver outputs. The note explains why within L=6 the only nontrivial pair-independence is (1,6) (N_2({1}) and N_2({6}) disjoint), and recommends escalation to L=7 to add independence for (1,7). To get a quantitative bound q<1 (tightening Corollary 18) the author advises solving an optimization variant (maximize interior properness probability) and recording the optimum q_6. Solver candidates: BARON, Couenne/Bonmin, SCIP-NLP. Files relied on: prover-01.out.json, output.md. Verifier verdict: partial success.
