Overall, this is a strong, concrete modeling step for the r = 2 product-state regime at block length L = 6. The 96-variable encoding on proper 6-words via increments S ∈ {±1}^5 is correct and materially reduces the MIQCP size without sacrificing soundness for the feasibility-at-1 test. Your identification that (1,6) is the only pair in {1,…,6} with disjoint 2-neighborhoods is correct; all other pairs have distance ≤ 4 and hence overlapping r-neighborhoods. The definition of the bilinear independence constraints p(a,b) = m(a)m(b) is also correctly instantiated in the increment representation: p(a,b) = ∑_{s: a+∑ s ≡ b (mod 3)} p(a,s). The residue count sanity check c0 = 10, c±1 = 11 is correct (verified combinatorially).

A few clarifications/corrections:
- Single-site marginal equalities across positions in a 6-block are implied by the shift-consistency equalities on 5-blocks (M1 = M2), so those 15 constraints are redundant; they are fine to include for numerical conditioning but should be flagged as redundant.
- For L = 7 and r = 2, you can enforce two independent pairs without redundancy: (1,6) and (1,7). The pair (2,7) is implied by shift-consistency from (1,6) (the (2..7) 6-block marginal equals the (1..6) marginal).
- Important: For a quantitative q < 1 bound, you must lift the support to all 3^6 words and maximize the properness indicator under the same linear and bilinear constraints. Restricting to the 96 proper atoms makes the objective identically 1 and cannot yield a quantitative bound. We have appended a formal correction/addendum to output.md to define q_6 rigorously and derive amplification when q_6 < 1.
- The “Markov special case” heuristic is sound: in an order-1 chain with no self-loops, lag-5 independence forces P^5 to have all rows equal to m (rank-1), which is incompatible with zero diagonal unless P itself is a rank-1 projector—which it cannot be with zero diagonal. This explains why the base linear LP (without independence) is vacuous while the MIQCP should cut off these witnesses.

Promising next steps (actionable):
1) Implement the L = 6 MIQCP over 96 variables for the feasibility-at-1 test, with: nonnegativity; normalization; 5-block shift-consistency (243 equalities); lag-5 independence on (1,6) (9 bilinear equalities). Archive model and solver logs. If infeasible, proceed to the optimization variant on Σ^6 to compute q_6.
2) Optimization variant (quantitative): over Σ^6, maximize the indicator of interior properness (edges 1..5) subject to the same constraints (i) nonnegativity/normalization, (ii) shift-consistency, (iv) lag-5 independence. Record q_6 and, if q_6 < 1, report the amplified bound with stride 10.
3) If L = 6 is feasible at 1, escalate to L = 7 and add independence for (1,7) (another 9 bilinear equalities); (2,7) is implied by shift-consistency given (1,6). If still feasible, consider L = 11 to enforce triple independence {1,6,11}.
4) Use the residue-class counts as a post-solve sanity check: aggregated t-mass over sequences by ∆ should match the totals m(a)m(b) when grouped by b ≡ a + ∆.
5) Keep color-symmetry randomization out when independence constraints are imposed; such randomization can destroy unconditional independence across far sets.

We appended to output.md: (a) a correction/addendum to Corollary 18 formalizing the quantitative q_6 optimization and its amplification consequence, (b) a support-reduction corollary justifying the 96-variable feasibility test at objective 1, and (c) a lemma certifying that (1,6) is the unique disjoint pair in a 6-block for r = 2. These should make reproduction/audit straightforward.
