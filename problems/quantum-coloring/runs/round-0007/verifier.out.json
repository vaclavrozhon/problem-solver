  "feedback_md": "Overall, this is a strong, concrete modeling step for the r = 2 product-state regime at block length L = 6. The 96-variable encoding on proper 6-words via increments S \u2208 {\u00b11}^5 is correct and materially reduces the MIQCP size without sacrificing soundness for the feasibility-at-1 test. Your identification that (1,6) is the only pair in {1,\u2026,6} with disjoint 2-neighborhoods is correct; all other pairs have distance \u2264 4 and hence overlapping r-neighborhoods. The definition of the bilinear independence constraints p(a,b) = m(a)m(b) is also correctly instantiated in the increment representation: p(a,b) = \u2211_{s: a+\u2211 s \u2261 b (mod 3)} p(a,s). The residue count sanity check c0 = 10, c\u00b11 = 11 is correct (verified combinatorially).\n\nA few clarifications/corrections:\n- Single-site marginal equalities across positions in a 6-block are implied by the shift-consistency equalities on 5-blocks (M1 = M2), so those 15 constraints are redundant; they are fine to include for numerical conditioning but should be flagged as redundant.\n- For L = 7 and r = 2, you can enforce two independent pairs without redundancy: (1,6) and (1,7). The pair (2,7) is implied by shift-consistency from (1,6) (the (2..7) 6-block marginal equals the (1..6) marginal).\n- Important: For a quantitative q < 1 bound, you must lift the support to all 3^6 words and maximize the properness indicator under the same linear and bilinear constraints. Restricting to the 96 proper atoms makes the objective identically 1 and cannot yield a quantitative bound. We have appended a formal correction/addendum to output.md to define q_6 rigorously and derive amplification when q_6 < 1.\n- The \u201cMarkov special case\u201d heuristic is sound: in an order-1 chain with no self-loops, lag-5 independence forces P^5 to have all rows equal to m (rank-1), which is incompatible with zero diagonal unless P itself is a rank-1 projector\u2014which it cannot be with zero diagonal. This explains why the base linear LP (without independence) is vacuous while the MIQCP should cut off these witnesses.\n\nPromising next steps (actionable):\n1) Implement the L = 6 MIQCP over 96 variables for the feasibility-at-1 test, with: nonnegativity; normalization; 5-block shift-consistency (243 equalities); lag-5 independence on (1,6) (9 bilinear equalities). Archive model and solver logs. If infeasible, proceed to the optimization variant on \u03a3^6 to compute q_6.\n2) Optimization variant (quantitative): over \u03a3^6, maximize the indicator of interior properness (edges 1..5) subject to the same constraints (i) nonnegativity/normalization, (ii) shift-consistency, (iv) lag-5 independence. Record q_6 and, if q_6 < 1, report the amplified bound with stride 10.\n3) If L = 6 is feasible at 1, escalate to L = 7 and add independence for (1,7) (another 9 bilinear equalities); (2,7) is implied by shift-consistency given (1,6). If still feasible, consider L = 11 to enforce triple independence {1,6,11}.\n4) Use the residue-class counts as a post-solve sanity check: aggregated t-mass over sequences by \u2206 should match the totals m(a)m(b) when grouped by b \u2261 a + \u2206.\n5) Keep color-symmetry randomization out when independence constraints are imposed; such randomization can destroy unconditional independence across far sets.\n\nWe appended to output.md: (a) a correction/addendum to Corollary 18 formalizing the quantitative q_6 optimization and its amplification consequence, (b) a support-reduction corollary justifying the 96-variable feasibility test at objective 1, and (c) a lemma certifying that (1,6) is the unique disjoint pair in a 6-block for r = 2. These should make reproduction/audit straightforward.",

Any proper 6-word \u03b6 \u2208 \u03a3^6 is uniquely described by a starting color and 5 increments S \u2208 {\u00b11}^5 via X_{j+1} \u2261 X_j + S_j (mod 3). There are exactly 3 \u00b7 2^5 = 96 such words. Use variables p(a, s) for a \u2208 \u03a3 and s \u2208 {\u00b11}^5; set t(\u03b6) = 0 for all non-proper \u03b6 by construction. This is sound for the feasibility-at-1 test because, under perfect interior properness, Proposition 16(iii) forces t to have support only on proper words.\n\n- Shift-consistency (stationarity). For each \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a3^5, the 5-block marginal at positions (1..5) equals that at (2..6): M_1(\u03b1) = M_2(\u03b1). There are 3^5 = 243 equalities (many are vacuous under the 96-word support). Single-site marginal equalities across positions are implied by these and may be included as redundant numerical stabilizers.\n\n- Lag-5 pair independence. Define the single-site marginals m(a) := \u2211_s p(a,s) and pair marginals p(a,b) := \u2211_{s: a + \u2211 s \u2261 b (mod 3)} p(a,s).

This MIQCP is a compact certificate vehicle for infeasibility at objective 1.\n\n- Combinatorial sanity checks (increment residues). Let \u2206 := \u2211_{j=1}^5 S_j (mod 3). Then b \u2261 a + \u2206 (mod 3). The counts of sequences by residue are: c_0 = 10 and c_{+1} = c_{\u22121} = 11. These are support sizes only; use them to cross-check solver outputs by aggregating t over residue classes and comparing to the independence targets m(a) m(b) grouped by b \u2212 a.\n\n- Escalation to L = 7. With r = 2 and L = 7, two nonredundant independent pairs can be imposed: (1,6) and (1,7). The pair (2,7) is automatically enforced by shift-consistency from (1,6). If L = 7 remains feasible at 1, consider L = 11 to impose triple independence for {1,6,11}.\n\nQuantitative bound q_6 and stride\n\n- To obtain an explicit q < 1, lift the support to all \u03a3^6 and maximize the interior properness indicator (edges 1..5) subject to: (i) nonnegativity + normalization, (ii) 5-block shift-consistency, (iv) lag-5 independence (on (1,6)). Denote the optimum by q_6.

Validate: equality of single-site marginals across positions; the independence equalities; residue-class aggregation sanity checks.\n- If L = 6 is infeasible at 1, immediately run the optimization variant to compute q_6 and report the amplified bound (stride 10). If still feasible at 1, add (1,7) independence at L = 7; if needed, move to L = 11 for triple independence.",

By Proposition 16, t satisfies (i), (ii), and (iv). Therefore, the probability that a contiguous 6-block is internally proper is at most q_6 by definition. Partition C_n into \u230an/10\u230b disjoint windows of length 6 separated by gaps of size 2r = 4; by Theorem 2 these window events are independent. Applying Corollary 3 with k = 6 yields the claim.\n\nCorollary 21 (Support restriction for the feasibility-at-1 test at r = 2, L = 6).\nIn the feasibility test for perfect interior properness on a 6-block (objective value 1), the search over t \u2208 \u0394(\u03a3^6) can be restricted to the 96 proper 6-words (those with \u03b6_j \u2260 \u03b6_{j+1} for j = 1,\u2026,5) without loss of generality.\n\nProof.\nIf an algorithm achieves probability 1 of interior properness, then Proposition 16(iii) implies t(\u03b6) = 0 whenever \u03b6 has an equal adjacent pair. Hence any feasible t must be supported on proper words.\n\nLemma 22 (Uniqueness of a disjoint pair in a 6-block for r = 2).\nLet r = 2 and consider positions {1,\u2026,6} on a line. For i < j, the r-neighborhoods N_r({i}) \u2229 [1..6] and N_r({j}) \u2229 [1..6] are disjoint if and only if {i, j} = {1, 6}.\n\nProof.\nFor boundary indices, N_2({1}) = {1,2,3} and N_2({6}) = {4,5,6}, which are disjoint. For any other pair 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 6, we have j \u2212 i \u2264 4. Then N_2({i}) contains i, i+1, i+2 and N_2({j}) contains j, j\u22121, j\u22122; these sets overlap because i+2 \u2265 j\u22122 whenever j \u2212 i \u2264 4. Thus only {1,6} yields disjoint neighborhoods.\n\nRemark 22.1 (L = 7).\nFor r = 2 and a 7-block, the r-neighborhoods of (1,6) and (1,7) are disjoint, so both pairs can be enforced as independent via bilinear constraints. The pair (2,7) is redundant given shift-consistency and the (1,6) constraints (it corresponds to the same relative pair inside the shifted 6-block (2..7)).",
