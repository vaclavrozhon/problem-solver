The 96-variable encoding on proper 6-words via increments S ∈ {±1}^5 is correct and materially reduces the MIQCP size without sacrificing soundness for the feasibility-at-1 test. Your identification that (1,6) is the only pair in {1,…,6} with disjoint 2-neighborhoods is correct; all other pairs have distance ≤ 4 and hence overlapping r-neighborhoods. The definition of the bilinear independence constraints p(a,b) = m(a)m(b) is also correctly instantiated in the increment representation: p(a,b) = ∑_{s: a+∑ s ≡ b (mod 3)} p(a,s). The residue count sanity check c0 = 10, c±1 = 11 is correct (verified combinatorially).\\n\\nA few clarifications/corrections:\\n- Single-site marginal equalities across positions in a 6-block are implied by the shift-consistency equalities on 5-blocks (M1 = M2), so those 15 constraints are redundant; they are fine to include for numerical conditioning but should be flagged as redundant.\\n- For L = 7 and r = 2, you can enforce two independent pairs without redundancy: (1,6) and (1,7). The pair (2,7) is implied by shift-consistency from (1,6) (the (2..7) 6-block marginal equals the (1..6) marginal).\\n- Important: For a quantitative q < 1 bound, you must lift the support to all 3^6 words and maximize the properness indicator under the same linear and bilinear constraints. Restricting to the 96 proper atoms makes the objective identically 1 and cannot yield a quantitative bound. We have appended a formal correction/addendum to output.md to define q_6 rigorously and derive amplification when q_6 < 1.\\n- The “Markov special case” heuristic is sound: in an order-1 chain with no self-loops, lag-5 independence forces P^5 to have all rows equal to m (rank-1), which is incompatible with zero diagonal unless P itself is a rank-1 projector—which it cannot be with zero diagonal. This explains why the base linear LP (without independence) is vacuous while the MIQCP should cut off these witnesses.\\n\\nPromising next steps (actionable):\\n1) Implement the L = 6 MIQCP over 96 variables for the feasibility-at-1 test, with: nonnegativity; normalization; 5-block shift-consistency (243 equalities); lag-5 independence on (1,6) (9 bilinear equalities). Archive model and solver logs. If infeasible, proceed to the optimization variant on Σ^6 to compute q_6.\\n2) Optimization variant (quantitative): over Σ^6, maximize the indicator of interior properness (edges 1..5) subject to the same constraints (i) nonnegativity/normalization, (ii) shift-consistency, (iv) lag-5 independence. Record q_6 and, if q_6 < 1, report the amplified bound with stride 10.\\n3) If L = 6 is feasible at 1, escalate to L = 7 and add independence for (1,7) (another 9 bilinear equalities); (2,7) is implied by shift-consistency given (1,6). If still feasible, consider L = 11 to enforce triple independence {1,6,11}.\\n4) Use the residue-class counts as a post-solve sanity check: aggregated t-mass over sequences by ∆ should match the totals m(a)m(b) when grouped by b ≡ a + ∆.\\n5) Keep color-symmetry randomization out when independence constraints are imposed; such randomization can destroy unconditional independence across far sets.\\n\\nWe appended to output.md: (a) a correction/addendum to Corollary 18 formalizing the quantitative q_6 optimization and its amplification consequence, (b) a support-reduction corollary justifying the 96-variable feasibility test at objective 1, and (c) a lemma certifying that (1,6) is the unique disjoint pair in a 6-block for r = 2. These should make reproduction/audit straightforward.\",\"new_notes_md\":\"Product-state MIQCP for r = 2 at L = 6 (compact and auditable)\\n\\n- Encoding and variables (96 proper atoms). Any proper 6-word ζ ∈ Σ^6 is uniquely described by a starting color and 5 increments S ∈ {±1}^5 via X_{j+1} ≡ X_j + S_j (mod 3). There are exactly 3 · 2^5 = 96 such words. Use variables p(a, s) for a ∈ Σ and s ∈ {±1}^5; set t(ζ) = 0 for all non-proper ζ by construction. This is sound for the feasibility-at-1 test because, under perfect interior properness, Proposition 16(iii) forces t to have support only on proper words.\\n\\n- Shift-consistency (stationarity). For each α ∈ Σ^5, the 5-block marginal at positions (1..5) equals that at (2..6): M_1(α) = M_2(α). There are 3^5 = 243 equalities (many are vacuous under the 96-word support). Single-site marginal equalities across positions are implied by these and may be included as redundant numerical stabilizers.\\n\\n- Lag-5 pair independence. Define the single-site marginals m(a) := ∑_s p(a,s) and pair marginals p(a,b) := ∑_{s: a + ∑ s ≡ b (mod 3)} p(a,s). Enforce p(a,b) = m(a) m(b) for all a,b ∈ Σ (9 bilinear equalities). For r = 2 and L = 6, (1,6) is the only pair with disjoint r-neighborhoods.\\n\\n- Constraint inventory (L = 6): 96 nonnegativity, 1 normalization, 243 shift-consistency, and 9 bilinear independence equalities. This MIQCP is a compact certificate vehicle for infeasibility at objective 1.\\n\\n- Combinatorial sanity checks (increment residues). Let ∆ := ∑_{j=1}^5 S_j (mod 3). Then b ≡ a + ∆ (mod 3). The counts of sequences by residue are: c_0 = 10 and c_{+1} = c_{−1} = 11. These are support sizes only; use them to cross-check solver outputs by aggregating t over residue classes and comparing to the independence targets m(a) m(b) grouped by b − a.\\n\\n- Escalation to L = 7. With r = 2 and L = 7, two nonredundant independent pairs can be imposed: (1,6) and (1,7). The pair (2,7) is automatically enforced by shift-consistency from (1,6). If L = 7 remains feasible at 1, consider L = 11 to impose triple independence for {1,6,11}.\\n\\nQuantitative bound q_6 and stride\\n\\n- To obtain an explicit q < 1, lift the support to all Σ^6 and maximize the interior properness indicator (edges 1..5) subject to: (i) nonnegativity + normalization, (ii) 5-block shift-consistency, (iv) lag-5 independence (on (1,6)). Denote the optimum by q_6. If q_6 < 1, then by Corollary 3 the success probability on C_n is at most q_6^{⌊n/(6+2r)⌋} for r = 2, i.e., stride 10.\\n\\nCautions and soundness reminders\\n\\n- Do not assume color-symmetry (e.g., uniform single-site marginals) when independence constraints are active unless proven w.l.o.g.; random global color-permutation can break unconditional independence across distant sets.\\n- The base (linear) segment LP (without independence) is provably trivial (q(r,k)=1); the MIQCP independence constraints are essential to exclude Markov-chain witnesses.\\n\\nImplementation checklist\\n\\n- Archive model files and logs (BARON/SCIP-NLP/Couenne/Bonmin).

If still feasible at 1, add (1,7) independence at L = 7; if needed, move to L = 11 for triple independence.\",\"new_notes_append\":\"True\",\"new_outputs_md\":\"Addendum 18.A (Quantitative variant and correction to Corollary 18)\\n\\nDefinition 19 (Quantitative 6-block optimum for r = 2).\\nLet Σ = {1,2,3}. Define q_6 to be the maximum of the interior-properness indicator on a 6-block under the constraints of Proposition 16(i), (ii), and (iv):\\n  q_6 := max_{t ∈ Δ(Σ^6)} ∑_{ζ ∈ Σ^6} t(ζ) · 1{ζ_j ≠ ζ_{j+1} for j = 1,…,5}\\nsubject to\\n  (i) t ≥ 0 and ∑_ζ t(ζ) = 1,\\n  (ii) 5-block shift-consistency: M_1(α) = M_2(α) for all α ∈ Σ^5,\\n  (iv) lag-5 independence: for all a,b ∈ Σ, ∑_{ζ: ζ_1=a, ζ_6=b} t(ζ) = (∑_{ζ: ζ_1=a} t(ζ)) (∑_{ζ: ζ_1=b} t(ζ)).\\n\\nCorollary 20 (Amplification via q_6).\\nIn the product-state regime (no shared entanglement) with r = 2, every 2-round uniform LOCAL algorithm on C_n satisfies, for all n ≥ 6,\\n  P_success(C_n) ≤ q_6^{⌊n/(6 + 2r)⌋} = q_6^{⌊n/10⌋}.\\nIn particular, if q_6 < 1 (as certified by solving the optimization above), we obtain an exponential-in-n upper bound.\\n\\nProof.\\nLet t be the 6-block marginal of the algorithm’s output process. By Proposition 16, t satisfies (i), (ii), and (iv). Therefore, the probability that a contiguous 6-block is internally proper is at most q_6 by definition. Partition C_n into ⌊n/10⌋ disjoint windows of length 6 separated by gaps of size 2r = 4; by Theorem 2 these window events are independent. Applying Corollary 3 with k = 6 yields the claim.\\n\\nCorollary 21 (Support restriction for the feasibility-at-1 test at r = 2, L = 6).\\nIn the feasibility test for perfect interior properness on a 6-block (objective value 1), the search over t ∈ Δ(Σ^6) can be restricted to the 96 proper 6-words (those with ζ_j ≠ ζ_{j+1} for j = 1,…,5) without loss of generality.\\n\\nProof.\\nIf an algorithm achieves probability 1 of interior properness, then Proposition 16(iii) implies t(ζ) = 0 whenever ζ has an equal adjacent pair. Hence any feasible t must be supported on proper words.\\n\\nLemma 22 (Uniqueness of a disjoint pair in a 6-block for r = 2).\\nLet r = 2 and consider positions {1,…,6} on a line. For i < j, the r-neighborhoods N_r({i}) ∩ [1..6] and N_r({j}) ∩ [1..6] are disjoint if and only if {i, j} = {1, 6}.\\n\\nProof.\\nFor boundary indices, N_2({1}) = {1,2,3} and N_2({6}) = {4,5,6}, which are disjoint. For any other pair 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 6, we have j − i ≤ 4. Then N_2({i}) contains i, i+1, i+2 and N_2({j}) contains j, j−1, j−2; these sets overlap because i+2 ≥ j−2 whenever j − i ≤ 4. Thus only {1,6} yields disjoint neighborhoods.\\n\\nRemark 22.1 (L = 7).\\nFor r = 2 and a 7-block, the r-neighborhoods of (1,6) and (1,7) are disjoint, so both pairs can be enforced as independent via bilinear constraints. The pair (2,7) is redundant given shift-consistency and the (1,6) constraints (it corresponds to the same relative pair inside the shifted 6-block (2..7)).\",\"new_outputs_append\":\"True\",\"verdict\":\"partial success\"}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"auto","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"VerifierNewSchema","schema_":{"properties":{"feedback_md":{"title":"Feedback Md","type":"string"},"new_notes_md":{"title":"New Notes Md","type":"string"},"new_notes_append":{"title":"New Notes Append","type":"string"},"new_outputs_md":{"title":"New Outputs Md","type":"string"},"new_outputs_append":{"title":"New Outputs Append","type":"string"},"verdict":{"title":"Verdict","type":"string"}},"required":["feedback_md","new_notes_md","new_notes_append","new_outputs_md","new_outputs_append","verdict"],"title":"VerifierNewSchema","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":15127,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":12626,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":9664},"total_tokens":27753},"user":null,"store":true}
