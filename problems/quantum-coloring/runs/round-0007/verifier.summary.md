Overall, this is a strong, concrete modeling step for the r = 2 product-state regime at block length L = 6. The 96-variable encoding on proper 6-words via increments S ∈ {±1}^5 is correct and materially reduces the MIQCP size without sacrificing soundness for the feasibility-at-1 test. Your identification that (1,6) is the only pair in {1,…,6} with disjoint 2-neighborhoods is correct; all other pairs have distance ≤ 4 and hence overlapping r-neighborhoods. The definition of the bilinear independence constraints p(a,b) = m(a)m(b) is also correctly instantiated in the increment representation: p(a,b) = ∑_{s: a+∑ s ≡ b (mod 3)} p(a,s). The residue count sanity check c0 = 10, c±1 = 11 is correct (verified combinatorially).
