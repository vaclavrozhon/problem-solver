This round set a concrete plan to prove nontrivial lower bounds for 3-coloring cycles in the r-round quantum LOCAL model for r=2,3. Key technical claim: two-way r-round algorithms without initial shared entanglement satisfy an "independence beyond r" property (two-way analogue of LGR Lemma 3) via a symmetric-buffer Heisenberg-picture argument. The team will generalize LGR's line-segment LP (Sec. 4.2) to parameter r and search numerically for a segment length k with LP optimum q(r,k)<1, using S3 color and translation symmetries and smaller generating families of frame-collections to reduce size. If q<1 then (A) without entanglement independence + LGR Lemma 4 gives exponential-in-n decay; (B) with entanglement non-signaling gives a constant-error lower bound via a window-covering argument. Main obstacles: Akbari et al. (2024) barrier and LP growth with r,k. Concrete next steps: formalize the independence lemma, implement the r=2 LP for k≈10–16 and produce primal/dual certificates, then extend to r=3 as feasible. Verifier: success.

This round fixed the independence/separation threshold to 2r (and updated the amplification stride to k+2r) and isolated a “placement invariance” principle for interior frames on a line segment: for r‑round algorithms with identical initial local states and uniform channels, the marginal on any r‑gapped core (fully r‑buffered inside the segment) is placement‑independent (Heisenberg‑picture operator‑support argument). A precise r‑non‑signaling LP on a segment was formulated: variables p_ψ over Σ^k (Σ={1,2,3}), objective maximizing probability of a proper coloring, and constraints equating core marginals across all gap‑r placements; symmetry reductions (S3, reflection) were proposed to shrink problem size. Useful lemmas (monotonicity q(r,k+1)≤q(r,k); infeasibility of point‑mass proper colorings under placement constraints) were noted. A practical plan targets r=2 LPs for k≈10–16 (single‑core s∈{1,2,3} plus selected two‑core families), solve with high‑precision solver, and extract dual certificates if optimum q<1 to obtain auditable bounds and amplification.

## round-0003 — model summary — 2025-08-27T15:28:56.613389Z
This round tightens the LP ↔ algorithmic interface: we added two structural lemmas (monotonicity in r and an extreme-point characterization), clarified when interior-placement equalities are physically justified (product-state or automorphism-invariant initial states, or a public random rotation), and produced an auditable plan to run r = 2 LP instances with symmetry reductions. The computational plan uses S3+reflection quotienting, staged constraint families (single-core, two-core, t=3), high-precision solvers, and extraction of dual certificates for k ∈ {10..16}, stopping when q < 0.99 (or any q < 1). A transfer-matrix / Markov-chain relaxation is proposed as an independent cross-check. Two textual clarifications are requested in output.md (after Definition 6 and in Corollary 8) to make the symmetry hypothesis explicit. Watchouts: over-reduction of symmetry and illegal interior-placement constraints; include dirac-mass infeasibility as a sanity test. Citations: prover-01.out.json (progress_md), output.md.

## round-0004 — model summary — 2025-08-27T16:03:02.353720Z
Main finding: the geometry-aware non-signaling LP in Definition 6 is too weak for the two-way model — there is an explicit feasible distribution that attains objective value 1 for every r ≥ 1 and k ≥ 1, so q(r,k)=1. Concretely, the order-1 stationary Markov chain on Σ={1,2,3} with uniform stationary law and P(σ→σ)=0, P(σ→τ)=1/2 (τ≠σ) generates only proper strings and satisfies all single- and multi-core geometry-aware translation invariances, so it is a feasible witness with success probability 1. Consequence: the segment LP (Definition 6) cannot certify any nontrivial constant-error lower bound in the two-way model (with or without entanglement); Corollary 10 is vacuous unless the constraint system is strengthened. Recommended corrective directions: (A) for product initial states, add independence/factorization constraints (nonlinear) or a lifted linear relaxation (Sherali–Adams style) to cut off the Markov witness; (B) for the entanglement-allowed regime, pivot to ring-level/ring-experiment or round-elimination/indistinguishability arguments tailored to small fixed r (start with r=2).

## round-0005 — model summary — 2025-08-27T18:51:08.786646Z
This round pivots from the trivial segment LP to independence-augmented linear relaxations in the product-state regime and to ring-level (experiment/view) arguments in the entanglement-allowed regime. Key technical move: add the linear, color-symmetric independence constraint I1(δ) that for any pair of single-site cores separated by δ ≥ 2r+1 forces P[X_i = X_{i+δ}] = 1/3. Lemma A shows the stationary nearest-neighbor proper Markov chain violates I1 (its equality probability is 1/3 + (2/9)(-1/2)^δ), so I1 excludes that witness. Formulation A2 (color-symmetric, pair-independence LP) and an auditable test A3 for r = 2 (k in 11..15) are proposed: add single- and two-core placement invariances, color-uniformity, and I1(5) (±I1(6)) and check feasibility with objective = 1; infeasibility yields a Farkas certificate. For the entanglement-allowed case, Track B outlines an r = 2 two-way analogue of LGR: search for two distance-mixtures (D1,D2) whose induced distributions over r-views match (view-equivalence), giving equal expectations under r-non-signaling but different expectations on proper colorings, producing a constant-error separation.

## round-0006 — model summary — 2025-08-27T19:01:44.309310Z
This round corrected analytic foundations and pivoted to a sound nonlinear feasibility test for the product-state r=2 regime. The team formulated a single stationary 6-block MIQCP (729 variables) whose linear constraints enforce shift-consistency and interior properness, and whose 9 bilinear equalities enforce exact pair-independence at lag δ = 5 — a necessary condition for any r=2 product-state perfect output. Key modelling fixes: independence is inherently bilinear (no linearization via color-symmetry) and the r=1 distance-mix trick does not extend to r=2. The stationary no-self-loop Markov chain has two-point correlation P[X_t = X_{t+d}] = 1/3 + (2/3)(−1/2)^d, so it violates lag-5 independence and motivates expectation of MIQCP infeasibility. Action plan: implement the 6-block MIQCP in global nonconvex solvers (BARON/Couenne/SCIP-NLP), escalate to 7-block if needed, and archive solver certificates if infeasible.

## round-0007 — model summary — 2025-08-27T19:49:04.784685Z
This round concretizes the r=2 feasibility test as an auditable MIQCP on “proper” 6-words: represent each proper 6-word by (a,S_1..S_5) with S_j∈{±1}, yielding 3·2^5=96 atoms and variables p(a,s). The model uses stationarity (shift-consistency) equalities (up to 243 linear constraints), normalization and nonnegativity, and nine bilinear equalities enforcing lag-5 independence (X_1 ⟂ X_6). Useful combinatorial checks were added: the 5-step increment-sum residues have counts c_0=10, c_{±1}=11 which map start a to end b via b≡a+Δ (mod 3) and are handy sanity checks on solver outputs. The note explains why within L=6 the only nontrivial pair-independence is (1,6) (N_2({1}) and N_2({6}) disjoint), and recommends escalation to L=7 to add independence for (1,7). To get a quantitative bound q<1 (tightening Corollary 18) the author advises solving an optimization variant (maximize interior properness probability) and recording the optimum q_6. Solver candidates: BARON, Couenne/Bonmin, SCIP-NLP. Files relied on: prover-01.out.json, output.md. Verifier verdict: partial success.
