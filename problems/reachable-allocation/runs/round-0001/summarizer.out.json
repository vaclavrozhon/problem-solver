Hence TREE-REACHABLE-PE \u2208 NP (certificate = target allocation). TTC (Top Trading Cycles) is globally PO and thus serves as a one-sided polynomial-time certificate: compute TTC and test tree-reachability.\n- Algorithmic/complexity landscape recorded: Reachable Object and PE on paths (O(n^2)), PE on generalized stars (O(n^2 log n) in the agent-moving model), reachable matching on trees (O(n^2)). NP-completeness / NP-hardness: Reachable Object on cliques NP-complete; Reachable Matching on cliques NP-complete; PE on cliques NP-hard (reductions from 2P1N-SAT).\n- Crucial open pivot: whether every IR + global-PO allocation must equal the TTC outcome. If true, TREE-REACHABLE-PE reduces to checking TTC reachability (polytime); if false, the general tree case remains open.\n\nCitations: papers/paper1.txt (Li, Plaxton, Sinha, arXiv:2103.01394); Research notes (round X).",
