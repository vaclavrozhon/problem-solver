Core progress: Established two solid building blocks: (i) any reachable allocation is IR; (ii) TREE-REACHABLE-PE is in NP via (a) O(n^2) reachability-to-target on trees and (b) O(n^2) global PO verification by improvement-cycle detection. TTC reachability is a correct one-sided polynomial-time certificate (if reachable, return TTC). The crucial claim enabling a full O(n^2) algorithm—that the unique IR+global-PO allocation equals TTC—remains unproven and is disputed by other provers. Until a rigorous proof or counterexample is supplied, the general polynomial-time decidability on trees is unresolved. A plausible FPT-in-treewidth DP was outlined. Next: prove or refute IR+PO uniqueness to TTC; otherwise refine parameterized and special-case algorithms.
