Hence TREE-REACHABLE-PE \u2208 NP (certificate = target allocation).\n- TTC (Top Trading Cycles) is globally PO, so TTC reachability gives a one-sided polynomial certificate (if reachable, return TTC and swaps). However a provided counterexample shows PO does not imply membership in the core, so TTC is not automatically the unique globally-PO IR outcome; the key claim \u201cIR+PO \u21d2 TTC\u201d remains unproven and is the decisive open pivot. Until it is proved or refuted, polynomial-time decidability on trees is unresolved.\nNext steps: attempt an inductive proof or search small instances (n\u22646) for counterexamples; explore an FPT DP by treewidth.\nSources: papers/paper1.txt; research notes (round X).",
