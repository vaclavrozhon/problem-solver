{"summary_md":"Round X summary — progress and open pivot.\n- Established core building blocks: reachable allocations are individually rational (IR); reachability to any fixed target on a tree is decidable in O(n^2) (good-edge scheduler) and produces a witness; global Pareto-efficiency (PO) of a given allocation is testable in O(n^2) via the improvement-digraph (PO ⇔ no directed cycle). Hence TREE-REACHABLE-PE ∈ NP (certificate = target allocation).\n- TTC (Top Trading Cycles) is globally PO, so TTC reachability gives a one-sided polynomial certificate (if reachable, return TTC and swaps). However a provided counterexample shows PO does not imply membership in the core, so TTC is not automatically the unique globally-PO IR outcome; the key claim “IR+PO ⇒ TTC” remains unproven and is the decisive open pivot. Until it is proved or refuted, polynomial-time decidability on trees is unresolved.\nNext steps: attempt an inductive proof or search small instances (n≤6) for counterexamples; explore an FPT DP by treewidth.\nSources: papers/paper1.txt; research notes (round X).","one_line_summary":"TREE-REACHABLE-PE ∈ NP; TTC gives a one-sided certificate but IR+PO⇒TTC is unresolved.","highlights":["Every reachable allocation is individually rational (IR).","Target reachability on trees decidable in O(n^2) via good-edge scheduling (with witness).","Global PO can be checked in O(n^2) by improvement-digraph acyclicity (PO ⇔ no cycle).","Therefore TREE-REACHABLE-PE lies in NP (certificate = target allocation).","TTC is globally PO and is a one-sided poly-time certificate if reachable, but PO ≠ core (counterexample) so TTC is not known to be the unique IR+PO allocation; decidability on trees remains open."],"next_questions":["Prove or refute: every IR + global-PO allocation equals the TTC outcome (search small n for counterexamples if refutation seems likely).","If refuted or unresolved, implement FPT algorithm (DP over treewidth) and/or exhaustive small-instance search to find reachable PO allocations ≠ TTC."]}
