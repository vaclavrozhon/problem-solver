We refuted the key claim that global PO equals the core: a 3-agent counterexample shows a globally PO allocation can be blocked by a coalition, so PO≠core and TTC is not the unique PO. Thus the O(n^2) algorithm reducing to TTC reachability is invalid. Solid pieces retained: reachable ⇒ IR; TREE-REACHABLE-PE ∈ NP via (i) O(n^2) reachability-to-target on trees and (ii) O(n^2) global PO test by improvement-digraph acyclicity; TTC as a sufficient certificate; sink special case decidable. Star uniqueness needs a full proof before promotion. Next: formalize an FPT DP by treewidth; complete a rigorous star proof (or counterexample); and expand small-instance searches.
