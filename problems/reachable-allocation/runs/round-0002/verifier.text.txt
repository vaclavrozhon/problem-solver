{"feedback_md":"Main audit points\n\n- Prover 2’s core⇔PO claim is false. In Shapley–Scarf housing markets, “core ⇒ PO” holds (a global Pareto improvement would be implemented by the grand coalition), but “PO ⇒ core” fails because a coalition can block µ using only its initial endowments even if there is no global Pareto improvement (outsiders may be worse). Concrete counterexample (3 agents, endowments 1:a,2:b,3:c). Preferences: 1: b ≻ c ≻ a; 2: a ≻ b ≻ c; 3: a ≻ b ≻ c. Allocation µ = (1→c, 2→b, 3→a) has no directed improvement cycle (hence globally PO), but coalition {1,2} can reassign their endowments {a,b} to (1→b,2→a), strictly improving both; thus µ is not in the core. Therefore, PO≠core and the “unique PO=TTC” conclusion is invalid. The O(n^2) algorithm reducing TREE-REACHABLE-PE to TTC reachability is incorrect.\n\n- Prover 1: Solid corrections. NP membership is right; “reachable ⇒ IR” is correct; “globally PO ⇒ no allowed swap” is correct. TTC as a sufficient certificate (if reachable, return it) is valid. The sink special case is valid: if µ0 is a sink, reach(µ0)={µ0}; decide by a single PO test.\n\n- Prover 3/4: Claims for stars are promising, but the unique-sink assertion needs a complete proof (order-independence). Until then, keep it in notes; do not move to proofs/output. The FPT-by-treewidth outline is reasonable (DP over nice decomposition; filter candidates by reachability and PO). Provide formal state definitions and transitions next.\n\n- Verification subroutines: Global PO via the improvement digraph (acyclicity) and tree target-reachability via “good edges” are both standard and belong in proofs.md; use them as the NP verifier.\n\nNext steps\n\n1) Add the explicit PO≠core counterexample to notes; correct any text claiming PO⇔core. 2) Formalize the treewidth-FPT DP: bag states (partial injection; used objects), introduce/forget/join transitions, size bound n^{O(w)}, and root filters (reachability + PO). 3) For stars, deliver a rigorous unique-sink proof or provide a counterexample. 4) Maintain TTC-as-certificate as a one-sided polynomial-time test and the sink special case. 5) Explore small instances (n≤6) to catalog when TTC is unreachable but some reachable globally PO exists; this informs structure and potential hardness.\n","summary_md":"We refuted the key claim that global PO equals the core: a 3-agent counterexample shows a globally PO allocation can be blocked by a coalition, so PO≠core and TTC is not the unique PO.

From the initial endowment µ0, any allocation µ obtained via a finite sequence of allowed edge-swaps is individually rational: for every agent v, µ(v) ≽_v µ0(v).\nProof. Each swap strictly improves its two participants and leaves others unchanged, so each agent’s assignment is monotonically nondecreasing w.r.t. their preference along the sequence.\n\nProposition (Global PO test). For a given allocation µ, build a directed graph D on agents∪objects with arcs a→b for each object b with b ≻_a µ(a), and arcs b→owner_µ(b). Then µ is globally Pareto-efficient iff D has no directed cycle.\nProof sketch. A directed cycle alternates agents/objects and yields a cycle of strictly improving trades, giving a global Pareto improvement. Conversely, any global Pareto improvement induces such a cycle in D.\n\nProposition (Tree reachability to a fixed target). Given a tree T, initial allocation µ0, and a target allocation µ*, we can decide in O(n^2) whether µ* is reachable by allowed swaps, and produce a swap sequence when it is. \nSketch. Let each agent move along the unique dipath from its current object to its target in µ*. An edge is good if both incident agents need to cross it next. If the target is reachable and not yet achieved, a good edge exists. Swapping across any good edge advances both agents; maintaining the set of good edges yields an O(n^2) algorithm.\n\nTheorem (TREE-REACHABLE-PE ∈ NP). A certificate is a target allocation µ*. Verification is polynomial: (i) decide µ0→µ* reachability on the tree in O(n^2) (previous proposition); (ii) test global PO of µ* via the acyclicity criterion in O(n^2).\n\nCorollary (Sink special case). If the initial allocation µ0 admits no allowed swap, then reach(µ0)={µ0}. Hence the instance is YES iff µ0 is globally PO (decidable in O(n^2))."},"output_update":null}
