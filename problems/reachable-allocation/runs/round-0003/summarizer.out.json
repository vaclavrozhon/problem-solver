Hence TREE-REACHABLE-PE \u2208 NP (certificate = target allocation).\n- TTC (Top Trading Cycles) is globally PO, so testing TTC reachability gives a one-sided polynomial certificate (if reachable, YES). However a 3-agent counterexample shows PO \u2260 core, so TTC is not guaranteed to be the unique IR+PO outcome \u2014 the critical claim \u201cIR+PO \u21d2 TTC\u201d remains unproven and is the decisive open pivot.\nNext actions: prove or refute IR+PO\u21d2TTC (or find small counterexamples), run small-instance enumeration (n\u22646), and/or develop a treewidth DP (FPT) or other parameterized algorithm.\nCitations: papers/paper1.txt; research notes (round X).",
