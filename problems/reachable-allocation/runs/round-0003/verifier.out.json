  "feedback_md": "Audit\n\n- Core vs global PO: Prover 2\u2019s \u201cPO \u21d4 core\u201d is false. A 3-agent counterexample shows a globally PO allocation that is blocked by a coalition using initial endowments. Hence TTC is not the unique globally PO outcome and TREE-REACHABLE-PE does not reduce to TTC reachability. Any algorithm built on this equivalence is invalid.\n\n- Safe primitives: All provers largely agree on solid components that belong in proofs: (i) reachable \u21d2 individually rational (IR); (ii) a polynomial global PO test via the improvement digraph (acyclicity); (iii) a polynomial tree reachability test for a fixed target matching using the \u201cgood edge\u201d scheduler; (iv) NP membership via these two checks. These are correct.\n\n- Stars: Prover 3 proposes a unique terminal state via an acceptance digraph and a center-monotonicity argument. The center-object monotonicity is sound, but the claim that the terminal allocation is unique (not only the center\u2019s final object) needs a fully rigorous proof of order-independence for all leaves; keep this in notes until completed. Prover 4 is appropriately cautious here.\n\n- Parameterized result: Prover 2\u2019s \u201cFPT in number of movers k\u201d enumerates subsets of size \u2264k (O(n^k)) and permutations (k!), yielding time O(n^k\u00b7k!\u00b7poly(n)). This is XP, not FPT. Please correct the classification or provide a true f(k)\u00b7poly(n)-time approach.\n\n- One-sided certificates: TTC-as-certificate and sink-tests are valid sufficient procedures; neither is complete on trees. Keep them as practical poly-time checks that produce constructive witnesses when they succeed.\n\nNext steps\n\n1) Formalize the stars result: either prove uniqueness of the terminal allocation with full order-independence or produce a counterexample. 2) Correct the movers-parameter claim to XP; investigate whether additional structure (e.g., bounded branch vertices + small k) yields FPT. 3) Develop a precise DP interface (boundary summaries) for a true decomposition-based algorithm on trees or craft a hardness reduction from Reachable Object on trees with a tree-preserving gadget. 4) Expand the catalog of small instances where TTC is unreachable but another reachable globally PO allocation exists; use them to validate or refute candidate structural lemmas.\n",

This is XP (slice-wise polynomial), not FPT. A true FPT algorithm would require f(k)\u00b7poly(n) time; further techniques (e.g., kernelization, bounded-branch parameters) are needed.\n\n- Stars (object-moving): The center\u2019s object increases monotonically in the center\u2019s preference along any allowed swap sequence. A proposed acceptance-digraph approach suggests a unique final center object, but uniqueness of the entire terminal allocation (order-independence across leaves) still lacks a fully rigorous proof. We keep stars in the \u201cspecial-case under investigation\u201d category until a complete proof or counterexample is produced.\n\n- Working plan: (i) Prove or refute unique terminal allocation on stars; (ii) Explore combined parameters (e.g., number of branch vertices plus k movers) for potential FPT; (iii) Formalize boundary summaries for a decomposition-based DP on trees; (iv) Build a small-instance benchmark set (n\u22646) with TTC unreachable yet some other reachable globally PO allocation present.\n"

    "content": "Lemma 1 (Reachable \u21d2 IR). From the initial endowment \u00b50, any allocation \u00b5 obtained via a finite sequence of allowed edge-swaps is individually rational: for every agent v, \u00b5(v) \u227d_v \u00b50(v).\nProof. Each swap strictly improves its two participants and leaves others unchanged. Hence each agent\u2019s assignment is monotonically nondecreasing in her preference relative to \u00b50.\n\nLemma 2 (PO implies no allowed swap). If a matching \u00b5 admits an allowed swap on some edge {u,w}, then the post-swap matching strictly improves u and w and leaves others unchanged, contradicting global PO. Thus any globally PO matching is a sink (no allowed swap).\n\nProposition 3 (Global PO test). For a given allocation \u00b5, build a directed graph D on agents\u222aobjects with arcs a\u2192b for each object b such that b \u227b_a \u00b5(a), and arcs b\u2192owner_\u00b5(b). Then \u00b5 is globally Pareto-efficient iff D has no directed cycle.\nProof sketch. A directed cycle yields a cyclic reallocation strictly improving all involved agents. Conversely, any strict Pareto improvement induces such a cycle in D. (Standard Shapley\u2013Scarf characterization.)\n\nProposition 4 (Tree reachability to a fixed target). Given a tree T, initial allocation \u00b50, and a target allocation \u00b5*, we can decide in O(n^2) whether \u00b5* is reachable by allowed swaps and produce a witness sequence if so.\nSketch. Let each agent follow the unique dipath from its current object to its target. An edge is good if both incident agents need to cross it next. If the target is reachable and not yet attained, some good edge exists. Swapping on any good edge advances both agents; maintaining the set of good edges yields an O(n^2) decision and sequence.\n\nTheorem 5 (TREE-REACHABLE-PE \u2208 NP). A certificate is a target allocation \u00b5*. Verification is polynomial: (i) check reachability \u00b50\u2192\u00b5* via Proposition 4 (O(n^2)); (ii) check global PO via Proposition 3 (O(n^2)).\n\nCorollary 6 (Sink special case). If the initial allocation \u00b50 admits no allowed swap, then reach(\u00b50)={\u00b50}. Hence the instance is YES iff \u00b50 is globally PO (decidable in O(n^2))."
