We corrected a pivotal error: global PO ≠ core, so TTC is not the unique globally PO outcome and the O(n^2) reduction to TTC reachability fails. Solid components established: reachable ⇒ IR; global PO test via improvement-digraph; fixed-target reachability on trees; NP membership. TTC reachability and sink-tests provide one-sided polynomial certificates. A proposed “FPT in k movers” is actually XP (O(n^k·k!·poly(n))). The star unique-terminal-state claim needs a full proof before promotion. Next: rigorous star proof or counterexample; refine parameterizations; formalize a DP boundary signature or pursue hardness; assemble small-instance benchmarks.
