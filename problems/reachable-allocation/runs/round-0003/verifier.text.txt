Hence TTC is not the unique globally PO outcome and TREE-REACHABLE-PE does not reduce to TTC reachability. Any algorithm built on this equivalence is invalid.\n\n- Safe primitives: All provers largely agree on solid components that belong in proofs: (i) reachable ⇒ individually rational (IR); (ii) a polynomial global PO test via the improvement digraph (acyclicity); (iii) a polynomial tree reachability test for a fixed target matching using the “good edge” scheduler; (iv) NP membership via these two checks. These are correct.\n\n- Stars: Prover 3 proposes a unique terminal state via an acceptance digraph and a center-monotonicity argument. The center-object monotonicity is sound, but the claim that the terminal allocation is unique (not only the center’s final object) needs a fully rigorous proof of order-independence for all leaves; keep this in notes until completed. Prover 4 is appropriately cautious here.\n\n- Parameterized result: Prover 2’s “FPT in number of movers k” enumerates subsets of size ≤k (O(n^k)) and permutations (k!), yielding time O(n^k·k!·poly(n)). This is XP, not FPT. Please correct the classification or provide a true f(k)·poly(n)-time approach.\n\n- One-sided certificates: TTC-as-certificate and sink-tests are valid sufficient procedures; neither is complete on trees.

This is XP (slice-wise polynomial), not FPT. A true FPT algorithm would require f(k)·poly(n) time; further techniques (e.g., kernelization, bounded-branch parameters) are needed.\n\n- Stars (object-moving): The center’s object increases monotonically in the center’s preference along any allowed swap sequence. A proposed acceptance-digraph approach suggests a unique final center object, but uniqueness of the entire terminal allocation (order-independence across leaves) still lacks a fully rigorous proof. We keep stars in the “special-case under investigation” category until a complete proof or counterexample is produced.\n\n- Working plan: (i) Prove or refute unique terminal allocation on stars; (ii) Explore combined parameters (e.g., number of branch vertices plus k movers) for potential FPT; (iii) Formalize boundary summaries for a decomposition-based DP on trees; (iv) Build a small-instance benchmark set (n≤6) with TTC unreachable yet some other reachable globally PO allocation present.\n"},"proofs_update":{"action":"append","content":"Lemma 1 (Reachable ⇒ IR). From the initial endowment µ0, any allocation µ obtained via a finite sequence of allowed edge-swaps is individually rational: for every agent v, µ(v) ≽_v µ0(v).\nProof. Each swap strictly improves its two participants and leaves others unchanged. Hence each agent’s assignment is monotonically nondecreasing in her preference relative to µ0.\n\nLemma 2 (PO implies no allowed swap). If a matching µ admits an allowed swap on some edge {u,w}, then the post-swap matching strictly improves u and w and leaves others unchanged, contradicting global PO. Thus any globally PO matching is a sink (no allowed swap).\n\nProposition 3 (Global PO test). For a given allocation µ, build a directed graph D on agents∪objects with arcs a→b for each object b such that b ≻_a µ(a), and arcs b→owner_µ(b). Then µ is globally Pareto-efficient iff D has no directed cycle.\nProof sketch. A directed cycle yields a cyclic reallocation strictly improving all involved agents. Conversely, any strict Pareto improvement induces such a cycle in D. (Standard Shapley–Scarf characterization.)\n\nProposition 4 (Tree reachability to a fixed target). Given a tree T, initial allocation µ0, and a target allocation µ*, we can decide in O(n^2) whether µ* is reachable by allowed swaps and produce a witness sequence if so.\nSketch. Let each agent follow the unique dipath from its current object to its target. An edge is good if both incident agents need to cross it next. If the target is reachable and not yet attained, some good edge exists. Swapping on any good edge advances both agents; maintaining the set of good edges yields an O(n^2) decision and sequence.\n\nTheorem 5 (TREE-REACHABLE-PE ∈ NP). A certificate is a target allocation µ*. Verification is polynomial: (i) check reachability µ0→µ* via Proposition 4 (O(n^2)); (ii) check global PO via Proposition 3 (O(n^2)).\n\nCorollary 6 (Sink special case). If the initial allocation µ0 admits no allowed swap, then reach(µ0)={µ0}. Hence the instance is YES iff µ0 is globally PO (decidable in O(n^2))."},"output_update":null}
