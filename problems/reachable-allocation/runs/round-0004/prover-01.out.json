These clarify swap dynamics and give concrete tools for searching reachable matchings on stars, while also refuting \u201cunique terminal allocation\u201d on stars.\n- We introduce the center-transition digraph H that captures all possible sequences of center agents under allowed swaps on a star. For any simple directed path in H, we construct the exact resulting matching in closed form and can then test global PO in O(n^2). This yields an explicit, verifiable enumeration scheme (XP in the number of swaps), and a foundation for further pruning/DP.\n\nNon-uniqueness of terminal allocation on stars\n\nClaim A (counterexample). On a star with center object o and two leaves a,b, the order of swaps can lead to different (swap-stable) terminal allocations.\n- Agents and initial locations: center agent O at o; leaf agents A at a, B at b.\n- Preferences:\n  - O: a \u227b b \u227b o.\n  - A: b \u227b o \u227b a.\n  - B: o \u227b b \u227b a.\nAnalysis.\n- Initially, O\u2013A and O\u2013B are both allowed (O prefers a,b over o; A,B prefer o over their leaves).\n- Sequence 1: O\u2013A (center becomes A), then A\u2013B (center becomes B). Final: center B at o; leaves: O at a, A at b. No further swap: B prefers o best; A at b prefers b over o; O at a prefers a over o.\n- Sequence 2: O\u2013B only. Final: center B at o; leaves: A at a, O at b. No further swap: B prefers o best; A at a would swap to o, but B does not prefer a over o; O at b prefers b over o.\nThus two distinct terminal allocations exist. Hence \u201cunique terminal allocation\u201d (order independence) fails on stars.\n\nCenter-transition digraph for stars\n\nLet agents be vertices; let u be \u201ccenter\u201d iff u currently occupies object o. Define a directed graph H on agents:\n- Add arc u \u2192 v iff both conditions hold:\n  (i) u prefers object v (the leaf object at v) to o, and\n  (ii) v prefers o to its leaf object v.\nObservation B (soundness of arcs). If u is current center and u \u2192 v in H, then the swap (u at o, v at v) is allowed and results in v becoming the new center (at o).\nProof. (i) and (ii) are exactly the allowed-swap conditions over edge (o,v). After the swap, v occupies o (becomes center), and u occupies leaf v.\n\nLemma C (paths \u2192 feasible swap sequences). Let u0 be the initial center agent, and let P = (u0 \u2192 u1 \u2192 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u2192 ut) be any simple directed path in H (no repeats). Then the sequence of swaps (u0 with u1), (u1 with u2), \u2026, (u_{t\u22121} with u_t) is feasible from the initial state and results in u_t as the final center.\nProof. By induction on path length. For i=0, Observation B applies at (u0,u1). After swap i, the center becomes u_{i+1}. Because the path is simple, u_{i+1} has not appeared earlier and so is still at its own leaf immediately before becoming center; again Observation B applies to the next arc.\n\nLemma D (closed-form final matching from a path). For a simple path P = (u0 \u2192 u1 \u2192 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u2192 ut) in H, the resulting matching \u00b5(P) is:\n- center: u_t matched to o;\n- for i = 0,\u2026,t\u22121: u_i matched to the leaf object of u_{i+1};\n- every agent w not in {u0,\u2026,ut} remains at its original leaf object w.\nProof. Each swap (u_i,u_{i+1}) moves u_i from center to leaf u_{i+1} and moves u_{i+1} to center; agents not on the path never move. The final center is u_t.\n\nCorollary E (terminal centers via sinks). Along any path P, the process can continue only along outgoing arcs from the current center to as-yet unvisited agents. Thus terminal centers are exactly nodes u such that, after removing already-visited nodes, the current u has no outgoing arc to any unvisited v. In particular, a sink of H is a terminal center for some path.\n\nUse for TREE-REACHABLE-PE on stars\n\n- Compute H in O(n^2) by scanning preferences for each ordered pair (u,v) to test u: v \u227b_u o and v: o \u227b_v v.\n- Enumerate simple directed paths P from u0; for each, compute \u00b5(P) in O(|P|) via Lemma D and run the global PO test (improvement digraph acyclicity) in O(n^2).\n- If any \u00b5(P) is globally PO, we have a constructive YES with its swap sequence. Otherwise, report NO for the star instance.\nRemarks. The enumeration is XP in the number of swaps (|P|). Nonetheless H and Lemma D provide a precise, verifiable structure of the reachable set on stars and a basis for pruning/DP design (e.g., forbidding revisits, early stopping at local sinks, bounding out-degree by preference filters).\n\nGlobal facts to retain (for trees)\n\n- Reachable \u21d2 IR (already proved; belongs in proofs.md).\n- Global PO check is polynomial via the improvement digraph (acyclicity); belongs in proofs.md.\n- Tree target-reachability to a fixed \u00b5* is O(n^2) by good-edge scheduling; belongs in proofs.md.\n- TTC is a sufficient one-sided certificate: if \u00b5TTC is tree-reachable, return it and the swap sequence.\n- NP membership: certificate \u00b5*, verify reachability (O(n^2)) and PO (O(n^2)).\n\nObstacles\n\n- On stars, terminal allocations are not unique (Claim A). Thus any approach relying on order-independence fails. The H-graph yields a clean necessary-and-sufficient characterization of center transitions but does not immediately bound the number of paths; a DP or pruning strategy is needed for poly-time completeness.\n- Extending H beyond stars to general trees is nontrivial: center is unique in stars, whereas trees have many adjacent pairs; local conflicts mean a single static digraph won\u2019t capture all feasible sequences.\n\nNext steps\n\n1) Stars: Add to proofs.md the formal statements and proofs of Observation B, Lemmas C and D, and Corollary E; include the explicit counterexample to uniqueness (Claim A). Implement pruning rules on H (e.g., discard dominated arcs where choosing v blocks strictly better downstream options) and test on small n for reducing path search substantially.\n2) Trees: Use the \u201cgood-edge scheduling\u201d target reachability as a verifier while exploring parameterized search on the number of swaps k: bounded-depth search over a compact move-graph, with early PO checks when a terminal is reached.\n3) Hardness (trees): Pursue a tree-preserving \u201cladder\u201d gadget: a path with leaves that guarantees a directed cycle in the improvement digraph unless a designated agent reaches a designated object (encoding a source Reachable-Object-on-trees instance). Formalize the cycle-forcing ranks analogously to the clique reduction in Section 5 of the provided paper.\n\nConclusion\n\n- We clarified star dynamics via the center-transition digraph H, proved that all center sequences correspond bijectively to simple paths, and gave a closed-form construction of the resulting matching. This yields a concrete, auditable enumeration scheme to search for reachable globally PO outcomes on stars, and a clean refutation of unique terminal allocation. These results are building blocks for stronger pruning/DP and for understanding the broader tree case.\n"
