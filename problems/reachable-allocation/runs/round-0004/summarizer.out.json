  "summary_md": "Round summary (last round):\n- Established robust verification primitives: any reachable allocation is individually rational (IR); reachability to a fixed target on a tree can be decided in O(n^2) (good-edge scheduler) and yields a witness; global Pareto-efficiency (PO) of a given allocation is testable in O(n^2) via the improvement-digraph (PO \u21d4 no directed cycle). Consequently, TREE-REACHABLE-PE \u2208 NP (certificate = target allocation).\n- TTC (Top Trading Cycles) remains a useful one-sided polynomial certificate: if \u00b5_TTC is reachable on the tree, return it and the swap sequence. However, a simple 3-agent counterexample shows PO \u2260 core, so TTC need not be the unique IR+PO outcome; the crucial claim \u201cIR+PO \u21d2 TTC\u201d is unresolved. \n- Parameter/algorithmic observations: enumerating \u2264k movers gives an XP algorithm (n^{O(k)}); promising directions include FPT-by-treewidth DP and focused small-instance search (n\u22646) for counterexamples or structural patterns. \n",
