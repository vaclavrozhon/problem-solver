{"summary_md":"Round summary (last round):\n- Established robust verification primitives: any reachable allocation is individually rational (IR); reachability to a fixed target on a tree can be decided in O(n^2) (good-edge scheduler) and yields a witness; global Pareto-efficiency (PO) of a given allocation is testable in O(n^2) via the improvement-digraph (PO ⇔ no directed cycle). Consequently, TREE-REACHABLE-PE ∈ NP (certificate = target allocation).\n- TTC (Top Trading Cycles) remains a useful one-sided polynomial certificate: if µ_TTC is reachable on the tree, return it and the swap sequence. However, a simple 3-agent counterexample shows PO ≠ core, so TTC need not be the unique IR+PO outcome; the crucial claim “IR+PO ⇒ TTC” is unresolved. \n- Parameter/algorithmic observations: enumerating ≤k movers gives an XP algorithm (n^{O(k)}); promising directions include FPT-by-treewidth DP and focused small-instance search (n≤6) for counterexamples or structural patterns. \n","one_line_summary":"TREE-REACHABLE-PE ∈ NP; TTC is a one-sided certificate but IR+PO⇒TTC is open.","highlights":["Reachable allocations are individually rational (IR).","Target reachability on trees decidable in O(n^2) with witness (good-edge scheduler).","Global PO can be checked in O(n^2) via improvement-digraph acyclicity (PO ⇔ no cycle).","Hence TREE-REACHABLE-PE lies in NP (certificate = target matching).","TTC is globally PO and gives a one-sided poly-time witness if reachable, but PO≠core (counterexample) so TTC is not known to be the unique IR+PO solution.","Enumerating ≤k movers yields an XP algorithm (n^{O(k)}); FPT in treewidth or leaf-count are promising directions."],"next_questions":["Prove or find a counterexample to the pivot claim: does IR + global-PO imply the TTC outcome on trees?","Exhaustively search small instances (n≤6–7) to find reachable IR+PO allocations ≠ TTC and collect structural patterns.","If pivot fails or remains unresolved, implement a DP over a nice tree decomposition (store partial injections + reachability/PO flags) to obtain an FPT algorithm in treewidth."  ,"citations':['papers/paper1.txt','research notes (round X)']}breviation.json_error: invalid JSON object.
