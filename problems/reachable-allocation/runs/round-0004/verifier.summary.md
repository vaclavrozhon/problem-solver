We corrected model confusions and consolidated safe results: reachable ⇒ IR; global PO test via improvement-digraph; fixed-target tree reachability; NP membership. TTC remains only a sufficient certificate. For stars (object-moving), the final center object is unique but terminal allocations need not be; a valid counterexample was given. An XP algorithm in k movers is formalized as a baseline exact solver. Proposed FPT by number of leaves requires precise boundary summaries before entering proofs. Next: formalize the leaves-parameter DP, a star-DAG DP for PO sinks, and refine double-star confluence or bounded branching.
