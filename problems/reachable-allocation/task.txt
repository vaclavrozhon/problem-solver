Definitions.
• Model. Tree T = (V, E). Each agent v ∈ V initially holds object
h_v and has a strict preference ≻_v over all objects.
• Allowed move. A pairwise swap on edge {u, w} is allowed only
if both agents strictly prefer the object they would receive.
• Reachable / Pareto-efficient. Allocation π is reachable if obtained by a finite sequence of allowed swaps from the initial allocation.
π is Pareto-efficient (PE) if no allocation (global) Pareto-dominates
it.

Example:
- Graph with vertices A B C D, edges BA, BC, BD
- following table lists preferences:
Agent Object Preference
A a d ≻ c ≻ b ≻ a
B b a ≻ d ≻ c ≻ b
C c b ≻ a ≻ d ≻ c
D d c ≻ b ≻ a ≻ d

Example solution: sequence of swaps (B, C),(B, D),(B, A).

Question: Given T, initial allocation and preferences. Either produce a reachable Pareto-efficient allocation or report that none exists (TREE-REACHABLE-PE). Is this decidable in polynomial time on trees?
