  "content": "Ideas\n- We isolate a large class of \u201creasonable\u201d alternative metrics that still look only at finitely much geometry near the root at any given resolution; we call these localizable. For this class we prove that the meagreness/nowhere-denseness statements about bridges (Theorems 14\u201316 in the abstract) are invariant. In particular, bridgeless graphs remain nowhere dense, hence not typical, for all such metrics (\u2264D and =D with D odd).\n- We also test a global, nonlocal attempt based on \u201cbridge profiles\u201d Hr(G)=1 if Br(G) contains a bridge, otherwise 0. We show why this metric either destroys the Baire property or makes the bridge-set have nonempty interior, so it does not yield bridgeless graphs as typical in a satisfactory (Baire) topology.\n- For even D-regular graphs, 1-way infinite bridges cannot exist; we show that the same localizable-metric invariance forces the set \u201cno cut vertex\u201d to be nowhere dense (hence atypical) but does not immediately settle typicality of \u201cbridgeless\u201d.\n\nDefinition (localizable metrics)\nA metric d on X=G\u22c5,D is localizable if for every x\u2208X and \u03b5>0 there is r such that the d\u22c5-cylinder XBr(x):={y: Br(y)\u2245Br(x)} is contained in the d-ball U\u03b5(x). Equivalently, every d-neighborhood of x contains some d\u22c5-cylinder around x. (This is strictly weaker than d and d\u22c5 inducing the same topology; it allows d to be strictly coarser.)\n\nExamples\n- Any metric topologically equivalent to d\u22c5 (e.g., renormalizations, equivalent ultrametrics) is localizable.\n- Any metric of the form d\u2032(x,y)=\u2211r wrr(x,y) with wr\u21980 and r(x,y) depending only on Br(x),Br(y) (edit-distances, pattern-count distances, local decorated metrics) is localizable: fixing Br(x) determines all terms up to r, so the tail \u2211r>R wr can be made <\u03b5.\n- Quasi-local variants where neighborhoods are defined by finitely many local constraints (finite sets of rooted patterns) are localizable.\n\nTheorem A (robust nowhere-denseness under localizable metrics)\nFix D\u22652. Let d be any localizable metric on X=G\u22c5,\u2264D. Then the set S of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense in (X,d). Likewise, for X=G\u22c5,=D with D odd, S is nowhere dense in (X,d).\n\nProof\nLet U be a nonempty d-open set and x\u2208U. By localizability, pick r with XBr(x)\u2282U. Write F=Br(x). We will find an r\u2032-ball F\u2032 extending F such that every extension of F\u2032 contains a bridge. Then XF\u2032\u2282U and XF\u2032\u2229S=\u2205, so S has empty interior. Repeating for every d-open U shows S is nowhere dense.\nCase \u2264D: Because x is infinite and \u2206\u2264D, some boundary vertex u\u2208Lr(F) has degF(u)<D. Define F\u2032 by attaching a new pendant vertex to u (no degree bound is violated). In any infinite extension of F\u2032 that preserves degrees \u2264D, the new leaf-edge is a 1-way infinite bridge, so XF\u2032\u2282X\\S.\nCase =D with D odd: Use the parity gadget outlined in the abstract. Let S(F)=\u2211v\u2208Lr(F)(D\u2212degF(v)). Modify F within radius r+O(1) by local D-regular \u201cfillers\u201d (e.g., KD+1\u2212e and short tree-like patches) so that S(F)\u22611 (mod 2), and then attach a new vertex along a designated boundary stub preserving D-regularity. The unique new edge becomes a bridge in every extension. Thus we get F\u2032 with XF\u2032\u2282X\\S.\nIn either case, since XF\u2032\u2282XBr(x)\u2282U and XF\u2032 is nonempty, no d-open set is contained in S; hence S is nowhere dense.\n\nCorollary A1\n- In (G\u22c5,\u2264D,d), S is meagre for every localizable metric d.\n- In (G\u22c5,=D,d) with D odd, S is meagre for every localizable metric d.\n\nRemark on even D-regular\nWhen D is even, 1-way infinite bridges cannot occur. The same construction (with suitable gadgets) shows that the set T of graphs without a cut vertex is nowhere dense under any localizable metric (this reproduces Theorem 15 in the new generality). Whether S itself is nowhere dense in G\u22c5,=D with even D under all localizable metrics remains tied to the specific bridge-forcing gadgetry; our method does not produce a 2-way infinite bridge that preserves D-regularity from an arbitrary cylinder, so this case remains open here.\n\nObstacle: nonlocal metrics via bridge profiles\nA tempting approach is to force typical bridgelessness by adding a \u201cbridge-profile\u201d coordinate. Let Hr(G)=1 iff Br(G) contains a bridge; define\ndbridge(x,y)=\u2211r\u22651 2\u2212r\u22121|Hr(x)\u2212Hr(y)|, dnew=d\u22c5+dbridge.\n- Non-Baire warning: Consider a bridgeless base G0 and Gn formed by attaching a leaf at distance n. Then d\u22c5(Gn,G0)\u21920 while Hr(Gn)=1 for r\u2265n; so (Gn) is Cauchy in dnew with Hr-limit the all-1 sequence, but its putative d\u22c5-limit is G0 with H(G0)\u22610. Thus the graph of H is not closed in the compact product; (X,dnew) is not complete. Without further work (e.g., showing X is a G\u03b4 in a Polish superspace), the Baire property is unclear; typicality would be ill-posed.\n- Interior issue: For AN={G: Hr(G)=1 for all r\u2265N} (2-way bridge within distance \u2264N), the set AN has nonempty interior in dnew: small dnew-balls around graphs in AN forbid flipping HN, hence stay inside AN. Therefore the bridge set is not meagre.\nThis illustrates why simply adding a global boolean coordinate is not a workable remedy.\n\nConsequences and scope\n- Any \u201cfinite-radius based\u201d alternative (edit distances on balls, weighted multi-ball comparisons, decorated local signatures, FO-local types, etc.) is localizable; thus bridges remain atypical under these natural variants.\n- To alter typicality one must move to genuinely nonlocal topologies where d-neighborhoods do not necessarily contain a d\u22c5-cylinder. Such topologies tend to jeopardize completeness/Baire-ness or render the bridge set open (hence never meagre in a Baire space).\n\nExamples (sanity checks)\n- Discrete metric: everything becomes typical (space is not Baire in the intended sense); this is unnatural.\n- Quasi-isometry/neargeodesic metrics: basic neighborhoods allow attaching finite appendages arbitrarily far without leaving the neighborhood; these are still localizable in the above sense and do not change the conclusion.\n\nNext steps\n- Even D-regular case: Either (i) design a uniform degree-D gadget that, from any regular cylinder, forces a 2-way infinite bridge in all extensions, or (ii) prove that no such gadget can exist, and identify the sharp obstruction. This will settle whether bridges are nowhere dense for even D under localizable metrics.\n- Invariance principle: Formalize a general \u201crobust meagreness\u201d scheme: any property P that can be falsified by a uniform cylinder-refinement (as in Theorem A) is nowhere dense under any localizable metric. Package the parity/leaf gadgets into a general criterion.\n- Baire-safe global metrics: Identify nonlocal metrics where the subspace X is G\u03b4 in a Polish ambient space (hence Baire) and examine if bridges can become meagre. Candidate features include functions of all finite cuts S\u21a6|\u03b4(S)| restricted to finite S containing Br, but continuity and Baire issues must be addressed.\n\nSummary\n- We proved that for a broad and natural class of alternative metrics (localizable metrics), the typicality of \u201cbridgeless\u201d graphs does not change: bridgeless graphs are nowhere dense (hence meagre) in G\u22c5,\u2264D and in G\u22c5,=D for odd D, exactly as under d\u22c5.\n- Attempts to force typical bridgelessness by adding a global \u201cbridge profile\u201d coordinate either break the Baire property or make the bridge set have nonempty interior, so they do not yield a satisfactory positive example.\n- The only plausible path to a positive example would require a carefully designed nonlocal, Baire-safe topology; we outline obstacles to such a construction and leave even D-regular as a focused open case for gadget development or an impossibility proof."
