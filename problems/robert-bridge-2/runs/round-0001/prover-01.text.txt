Ideas
- We isolate a large class of “reasonable” alternative metrics that still look only at finitely much geometry near the root at any given resolution; we call these localizable. For this class we prove that the meagreness/nowhere-denseness statements about bridges (Theorems 14–16 in the abstract) are invariant. In particular, bridgeless graphs remain nowhere dense, hence not typical, for all such metrics (≤D and =D with D odd).
- We also test a global, nonlocal attempt based on “bridge profiles” Hr(G)=1 if Br(G) contains a bridge, otherwise 0. We show why this metric either destroys the Baire property or makes the bridge-set have nonempty interior, so it does not yield bridgeless graphs as typical in a satisfactory (Baire) topology.
- For even D-regular graphs, 1-way infinite bridges cannot exist; we show that the same localizable-metric invariance forces the set “no cut vertex” to be nowhere dense (hence atypical) but does not immediately settle typicality of “bridgeless”.

Definition (localizable metrics)
A metric d on X=G⋅,D is localizable if for every x∈X and ε>0 there is r such that the d⋅-cylinder XBr(x):={y: Br(y)≅Br(x)} is contained in the d-ball Uε(x). Equivalently, every d-neighborhood of x contains some d⋅-cylinder around x. (This is strictly weaker than d and d⋅ inducing the same topology; it allows d to be strictly coarser.)

Examples
- Any metric topologically equivalent to d⋅ (e.g., renormalizations, equivalent ultrametrics) is localizable.
- Any metric of the form d′(x,y)=∑r wrr(x,y) with wr↘0 and r(x,y) depending only on Br(x),Br(y) (edit-distances, pattern-count distances, local decorated metrics) is localizable: fixing Br(x) determines all terms up to r, so the tail ∑r>R wr can be made <ε.
- Quasi-local variants where neighborhoods are defined by finitely many local constraints (finite sets of rooted patterns) are localizable.

Theorem A (robust nowhere-denseness under localizable metrics)
Fix D≥2. Let d be any localizable metric on X=G⋅,≤D. Then the set S of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense in (X,d). Likewise, for X=G⋅,=D with D odd, S is nowhere dense in (X,d).

Proof
Let U be a nonempty d-open set and x∈U. By localizability, pick r with XBr(x)⊂U. Write F=Br(x). We will find an r′-ball F′ extending F such that every extension of F′ contains a bridge. Then XF′⊂U and XF′∩S=∅, so S has empty interior. Repeating for every d-open U shows S is nowhere dense.
Case ≤D: Because x is infinite and ∆≤D, some boundary vertex u∈Lr(F) has degF(u)<D. Define F′ by attaching a new pendant vertex to u (no degree bound is violated). In any infinite extension of F′ that preserves degrees ≤D, the new leaf-edge is a 1-way infinite bridge, so XF′⊂X\S.
Case =D with D odd: Use the parity gadget outlined in the abstract. Let S(F)=∑v∈Lr(F)(D−degF(v)). Modify F within radius r+O(1) by local D-regular “fillers” (e.g., KD+1−e and short tree-like patches) so that S(F)≡1 (mod 2), and then attach a new vertex along a designated boundary stub preserving D-regularity. The unique new edge becomes a bridge in every extension. Thus we get F′ with XF′⊂X\S.
In either case, since XF′⊂XBr(x)⊂U and XF′ is nonempty, no d-open set is contained in S; hence S is nowhere dense.

Corollary A1
- In (G⋅,≤D,d), S is meagre for every localizable metric d.
- In (G⋅,=D,d) with D odd, S is meagre for every localizable metric d.

Remark on even D-regular
When D is even, 1-way infinite bridges cannot occur. The same construction (with suitable gadgets) shows that the set T of graphs without a cut vertex is nowhere dense under any localizable metric (this reproduces Theorem 15 in the new generality). Whether S itself is nowhere dense in G⋅,=D with even D under all localizable metrics remains tied to the specific bridge-forcing gadgetry; our method does not produce a 2-way infinite bridge that preserves D-regularity from an arbitrary cylinder, so this case remains open here.

Obstacle: nonlocal metrics via bridge profiles
A tempting approach is to force typical bridgelessness by adding a “bridge-profile” coordinate. Let Hr(G)=1 iff Br(G) contains a bridge; define
dbridge(x,y)=∑r≥1 2−r−1|Hr(x)−Hr(y)|, dnew=d⋅+dbridge.
- Non-Baire warning: Consider a bridgeless base G0 and Gn formed by attaching a leaf at distance n. Then d⋅(Gn,G0)→0 while Hr(Gn)=1 for r≥n; so (Gn) is Cauchy in dnew with Hr-limit the all-1 sequence, but its putative d⋅-limit is G0 with H(G0)≡0. Thus the graph of H is not closed in the compact product; (X,dnew) is not complete. Without further work (e.g., showing X is a Gδ in a Polish superspace), the Baire property is unclear; typicality would be ill-posed.
- Interior issue: For AN={G: Hr(G)=1 for all r≥N} (2-way bridge within distance ≤N), the set AN has nonempty interior in dnew: small dnew-balls around graphs in AN forbid flipping HN, hence stay inside AN. Therefore the bridge set is not meagre.
This illustrates why simply adding a global boolean coordinate is not a workable remedy.

Consequences and scope
- Any “finite-radius based” alternative (edit distances on balls, weighted multi-ball comparisons, decorated local signatures, FO-local types, etc.) is localizable; thus bridges remain atypical under these natural variants.
- To alter typicality one must move to genuinely nonlocal topologies where d-neighborhoods do not necessarily contain a d⋅-cylinder. Such topologies tend to jeopardize completeness/Baire-ness or render the bridge set open (hence never meagre in a Baire space).

Examples (sanity checks)
- Discrete metric: everything becomes typical (space is not Baire in the intended sense); this is unnatural.
- Quasi-isometry/neargeodesic metrics: basic neighborhoods allow attaching finite appendages arbitrarily far without leaving the neighborhood; these are still localizable in the above sense and do not change the conclusion.

Next steps
- Even D-regular case: Either (i) design a uniform degree-D gadget that, from any regular cylinder, forces a 2-way infinite bridge in all extensions, or (ii) prove that no such gadget can exist, and identify the sharp obstruction. This will settle whether bridges are nowhere dense for even D under localizable metrics.
- Invariance principle: Formalize a general “robust meagreness” scheme: any property P that can be falsified by a uniform cylinder-refinement (as in Theorem A) is nowhere dense under any localizable metric. Package the parity/leaf gadgets into a general criterion.
- Baire-safe global metrics: Identify nonlocal metrics where the subspace X is Gδ in a Polish ambient space (hence Baire) and examine if bridges can become meagre. Candidate features include functions of all finite cuts S↦|δ(S)| restricted to finite S containing Br, but continuity and Baire issues must be addressed.

Summary
- We proved that for a broad and natural class of alternative metrics (localizable metrics), the typicality of “bridgeless” graphs does not change: bridgeless graphs are nowhere dense (hence meagre) in G⋅,≤D and in G⋅,=D for odd D, exactly as under d⋅.
- Attempts to force typical bridgelessness by adding a global “bridge profile” coordinate either break the Baire property or make the bridge set have nonempty interior, so they do not yield a satisfactory positive example.
- The only plausible path to a positive example would require a carefully designed nonlocal, Baire-safe topology; we outline obstacles to such a construction and leave even D-regular as a focused open case for gadget development or an impossibility proof.
