Thus two metrics with the same open sets have the same typical sets.\n- Identify a broad class of \u201cnatural, local\u201d topologies (those whose bases are the cylinder sets determined by finitely many rooted r\u2011balls) and prove a no\u2011go: in that whole class, bridgeless graphs are not typical in \\(\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,\\le D}\\) for \\(D>2\\) (and similarly for odd \\(D\\) in \\(\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,=D}\\)).\n- Note a simple positive: in \\(\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,=D}\\) with even \\(D\\), bridgeless graphs are already comeagre under the usual local metric.\n- Outline a genuinely different, global \u201cend\u2011sensitive\u201d topology that might alter typicality, and state what needs to be shown.\n\nResults and proofs\n\nProposition 1 (topological invariance of typicality). If two metrics induce the same topology on \\(\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,D}\\), then a set is meagre/comeagre/nowhere dense in one iff it is so in the other.\nProof. Meagre/comeagre/nowhere dense are topological notions.\n\nLemma 2 (bridge type in even\u2011regular graphs). In a countably infinite \\(D\\)\u2011regular graph with even \\(D\\), every bridge is 2\u2011way infinite.\nProof. Suppose deleting a bridge \\(e\\) leaves a finite component \\(C\\). Then \\(\\sum_{v\\in C}\\deg_G(v)=D|C|\\) is even, while \\(\\sum_{v\\in C}\\deg_G(v)=2|E(C)|+|\\delta(C)|=2|E(C)|+1\\) is odd (since \\(\\delta(C)=\\{e\\}\\)). Contradiction.\n\nTheorem 3 (bridgeless is comeagre in even\u2011regular). Fix even \\(D>2\\). In \\(\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,=D}\\) with the local metric, the set of graphs with a 2\u2011way infinite bridge is meagre (Theorem 16 in the paper). By Lemma 2, \u201chas some bridge\u201d equals \u201chas a 2\u2011way infinite bridge,\u201d so its complement (bridgeless) is comeagre.\n\nDefinition 4 (cylinder\u2011type topology). A topology \\(\\mathcal T\\) on \\(\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,\\le D}\\) has a cylinder base if every nonempty basic open set contains some cylinder \\(\\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^F\\) for an extendable rooted ball \\(F\\) (i.e., \\(\\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^F\\neq\\varnothing\\)). This includes the usual local topology and any refinement built by labeling vertices with finitely many local labels (degrees, colors, etc.).\n\nTheorem 5 (no\u2011go for cylinder topologies in \\(\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,\\le D}\\) with \\(D>2\\)). In any cylinder\u2011type topology \\(\\mathcal T\\) on \\(\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,\\le D}\\), the set \\(\\mathcal B\\) of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense.\nProof. Let \\(U\\) be a nonempty open set. It contains \\(\\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^F\\) for some extendable \\(F=B_r(G,\\rho)\\), which necessarily has a boundary vertex \\(x\\) at distance \\(r\\) with \\(\\deg_F(x)<D\\) (otherwise \\(\\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^F=\\varnothing\\) for infinite graphs). Form \\(F'\\) by extending \\(F\\) to radius \\(r+2\\), attaching a pendant path \\(x\\!-\u0000a0y\\!-\u0000a0z\\) with \\(\\deg_{F'}(z)=1\\). Because \\(D>2\\), we can also ensure some boundary vertex of \\(F'\\) still has free degree to continue to infinity (attach, say, an infinite \\((D-1)\\)\u2011ary tree beyond a different boundary vertex). Then \\(\\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^{F'}\\subseteq U\\) and every graph in \\(\\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^{F'}\\) has the bridge \\(yz\\). Moreover, any graph locally agreeing with \\(F'\\) up to radius \\(r+2\\) must contain this bridge (the leaf vertex \\(z\\) has degree 1), so \\(\\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^{F'}\\cap \\overline{\\mathcal B}=\\varnothing\\). Hence \\(\\mathcal B\\) has empty interior in every open set; equivalently, \\(\\mathcal B\\) is nowhere dense.\n\nCorollary 6. For any metric whose topology refines the local topology (e.g., any ultrametric of the form \\(2^{-f(R)}\\) based on matching rooted \\(R\\)\u2011balls, degree\u2011labeled local metrics, FO\u2011local logics via Gaifman locality), bridgeless graphs are not typical in \\(\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,\\le D}\\) for \\(D>2\\).\n\nTheorem 7 (odd\u2011regular no\u2011go). Fix odd \\(D>2\\). In any cylinder\u2011type topology on \\(\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,=D}\\), the set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense.\nProof sketch. This is the same finite\u2011gadget forcing as in Theorem 14(ii) of the paper: from any cylinder \\(\\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^F\\) one extends to a slightly larger ball \\(F'\\) by parity gadgets ensuring any \\(D\\)\u2011regular completion creates a 2\u2011way infinite bridge; as above, \\(\\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^{F'}\\cap \\overline{\\mathcal B}=\\varnothing\\).\n\nMonotonicity under refinement\nProposition 8. If \\(\\mathcal T'\\) refines \\(\\mathcal T\\) and \\(S\\) is nowhere dense in \\(\\mathcal T\\), then \\(S\\) is nowhere dense in \\(\\mathcal T'\\).\nProof. \\(\\overline{S}^{\\mathcal T'}\\subseteq \\overline{S}^{\\mathcal T}\\); taking interiors, \\(\\mathrm{int}_{\\mathcal T'}\\overline{S}^{\\mathcal T'}\\subseteq \\mathrm{int}_{\\mathcal T}\\overline{S}^{\\mathcal T}=\\varnothing\\).\nCorollary. No refinement of the local topology can make the bridgeless set typical in \\(\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,\\le D}\\) for \\(D>2\\) or in \\(\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,=D}\\) for odd \\(D\\).\n\nA candidate for metric sensitivity (global, end\u2011aware)\n- Define an \u201cend\u2011sensitive\u201d ultratopology by declaring basic open sets to fix: (i) an \\(r\\)\u2011ball \\(F\\), and (ii) for each boundary vertex \\(v\\in \\partial B_r\\), the number \\(b_v\\in\\{0,\\dots,D-\\deg_F(v)\\}\\) of incident edges whose rays belong to infinite components of \\(G\\setminus B_r\\). These data form a countable inverse system of finite sets; the inverse limit is compact, hence Baire.\n- Heuristic: In this topology, the \u201c1\u2011way infinite bridge somewhere\u201d sets become more fragile, because one can force \\(\\sum_{v\\in\\partial B_r} b_v\\ge 2\\) for infinitely many \\(r\\) by refining opens. If one could show that for every finite cut \\(S\\) there is a dense open set on which \\(|\\delta(S)\\cap E(G\\setminus S, \\infty)|\\ge 2\\), then \u201cno 1\u2011way infinite bridge\u201d would be comeagre. This remains to be proved; it fails if the prescribed \\(F\\) leaves only one available stub overall at some \\(S\\), so density must be checked carefully.\n\nObstacles\n- Any topology with a cylinder base (hence any metric determined purely by finitely many rooted balls, even with finitely many local labels) cannot change the typicality of bridges in the hard regimes (\\(\\le D\\), or odd\u2011regular). The obstruction is the ability to force a leaf inside arbitrarily small basic neighborhoods.\n- To make bridgeless typical one must genuinely alter the topology by encoding some global \u201ctail\u201d information in basic opens. Ensuring Baire property and naturality while proving meagreness of the bridge set is nontrivial.\n\nNext steps\n- Formalize the end\u2011sensitive inverse\u2011limit topology: prove it is compact/Baire and metrizable; characterize its basic clopen sets.\n- Investigate whether \u201cno 1\u2011way infinite bridge\u201d is comeagre there by establishing density of the constraints \u201c\\(|\\delta(S)|\\neq 1\\) for all finite \\(S\\)\u201d as a countable intersection of dense open sets.\n- Document that bridgelessness is already typical for even\u2011regular under the standard local metric (Theorem 3) as a clean corollary of Theorem 16.\n- Explore whether any coarser but still isomorphism\u2011invariant and Baire topology can render bridgeless typical without hard\u2011wiring the property into the metric; identify minimal global data needed (cut\u2011profile at infinity).\n\nSummary\n- Typicality is metric\u2011sensitive only if the topology changes. Within the large and natural class of local, cylinder\u2011based metrics (including any refinement by finitely many local labels), the typicality of \u201cbridgeless\u201d is invariant: not typical in \\(\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,\\le D}\\) for \\(D>2\\) and in \\(\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,=D}\\) for odd \\(D\\) (Theorems 5 and 7). Conversely, for even \\(D\\)\u2011regular graphs, bridgelessness is already comeagre under the standard metric (Theorem 3). A plausible route to truly different typical behavior is an end\u2011sensitive inverse\u2011limit topology; establishing comeagreness of bridgelessness there is an open, testable next step."
