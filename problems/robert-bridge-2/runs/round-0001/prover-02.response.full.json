These data form a countable inverse system of finite sets; the inverse limit is compact, hence Baire.\\n- Heuristic: In this topology, the \u201c1\u2011way infinite bridge somewhere\u201d sets become more fragile, because one can force \\\\(\\\\sum_{v\\\\in\\\\partial B_r} b_v\\\\ge 2\\\\) for infinitely many \\\\(r\\\\) by refining opens. If one could show that for every finite cut \\\\(S\\\\) there is a dense open set on which \\\\(|\\\\delta(S)\\\\cap E(G\\\\setminus S, \\\\infty)|\\\\ge 2\\\\), then \u201cno 1\u2011way infinite bridge\u201d would be comeagre. This remains to be proved; it fails if the prescribed \\\\(F\\\\) leaves only one available stub overall at some \\\\(S\\\\), so density must be checked carefully.\\n\\nObstacles\\n- Any topology with a cylinder base (hence any metric determined purely by finitely many rooted balls, even with finitely many local labels) cannot change the typicality of bridges in the hard regimes (\\\\(\\\\le D\\\\), or odd\u2011regular). The obstruction is the ability to force a leaf inside arbitrarily small basic neighborhoods.\\n- To make bridgeless typical one must genuinely alter the topology by encoding some global \u201ctail\u201d information in basic opens. Ensuring Baire property and naturality while proving meagreness of the bridge set is nontrivial.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Formalize the end\u2011sensitive inverse\u2011limit topology: prove it is compact/Baire and metrizable; characterize its basic clopen sets.\\n- Investigate whether \u201cno 1\u2011way infinite bridge\u201d is comeagre there by establishing density of the constraints \u201c\\\\(|\\\\delta(S)|\\\\neq 1\\\\) for all finite \\\\(S\\\\)\u201d as a countable intersection of dense open sets.\\n- Document that bridgelessness is already typical for even\u2011regular under the standard local metric (Theorem 3) as a clean corollary of Theorem 16.\\n- Explore whether any coarser but still isomorphism\u2011invariant and Baire topology can render bridgeless typical without hard\u2011wiring the property into the metric; identify minimal global data needed (cut\u2011profile at infinity).\\n\\nSummary\\n- Typicality is metric\u2011sensitive only if the topology changes. Within the large and natural class of local, cylinder\u2011based metrics (including any refinement by finitely many local labels), the typicality of \u201cbridgeless\u201d is invariant: not typical in \\\\(\\\\mathbf{G}_{\\\\bullet,\\\\le D}\\\\) for \\\\(D>2\\\\) and in \\\\(\\\\mathbf{G}_{\\\\bullet,=D}\\\\) for odd \\\\(D\\\\) (Theorems 5 and 7). Conversely, for even \\\\(D\\\\)\u2011regular graphs, bridgelessness is already comeagre under the standard metric (Theorem 3). A plausible route to truly different typical behavior is an end\u2011sensitive inverse\u2011limit topology; establishing comeagreness of bridgelessness there is an open, testable next step.\"\n}",
