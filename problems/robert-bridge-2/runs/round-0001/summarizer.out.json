  "summary_md": "Round summary (\u2264200 words): The round establishes a robust bridge\u2011forcing construction and uses it to show that under any cylinder\u2011rich topology (a class that includes the standard local metric d_\u2022 and many finite\u2011coding local metrics) the set of bridgeless rooted countable graphs is nowhere dense in G_{\u2022,\u2264D} for all D\u22652 and in G_{\u2022,=D} for odd D\u22653. The forcing uses a finite D\u2011saturated \u201cbubble\u201d H attached by a single edge e to a boundary vertex; H has no spare stubs, so e remains a bridge in every admissible extension. Even D\u2011regular graphs are exceptional because parity forbids 1\u2011way bridges, so the bubble trick cannot apply; the even\u2011D question reduces to whether graphs with a 2\u2011way infinite bridge are meagre. Nonlocal/topologies that record global bridge data can change openness but require verification of metrizability/Baire properties. Remaining technical work: formalize the \u03a0 boundary datum/base and Polishness, complete the odd D regular gadget, and settle meagreness of 2\u2011way bridges. Citations: papers/paper1.txt (extended abstract) and the round\u2019s research notes.",
