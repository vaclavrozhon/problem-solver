This seems like a conflict since the schema must be strictly followed, yet citations are required. I could include them in the summary_md, highlights, or next_questions sections. Still, it feels like adding them to the JSON key is better. However, the instruction clearly says to return strictly JSON, which makes this tricky! I'll plan to add citations in the summary_md.",

Also, I can mention that open tasks involve formalizing the odd D gadget and constructing nonlocal metrics.

The forcing uses a finite D\u2011saturated \u201cbubble\u201d H attached by a single edge e to a boundary vertex; H has no spare stubs, so e remains a bridge in every admissible extension. Even D\u2011regular graphs are exceptional because parity forbids 1\u2011way bridges, so the bubble trick cannot apply; the even\u2011D question reduces to whether graphs with a 2\u2011way infinite bridge are meagre. Nonlocal/topologies that record global bridge data can change openness but require verification of metrizability/Baire properties. Remaining technical work: formalize the \u03a0 boundary datum/base and Polishness, complete the odd D regular gadget, and settle meagreness of 2\u2011way bridges.
