{"summary_md":"Round summary (≤200 words): The round establishes a robust bridge‑forcing construction and uses it to show that under any cylinder‑rich topology (a class that includes the standard local metric d_• and many finite‑coding local metrics) the set of bridgeless rooted countable graphs is nowhere dense in G_{•,≤D} for all D≥2 and in G_{•,=D} for odd D≥3. The forcing uses a finite D‑saturated “bubble” H attached by a single edge e to a boundary vertex; H has no spare stubs, so e remains a bridge in every admissible extension. Even D‑regular graphs are exceptional because parity forbids 1‑way bridges, so the bubble trick cannot apply; the even‑D question reduces to whether graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge are meagre. Nonlocal/topologies that record global bridge data can change openness but require verification of metrizability/Baire properties. Remaining technical work: formalize the Π boundary datum/base and Polishness, complete the odd D regular gadget, and settle meagreness of 2‑way bridges.
