  "feedback_md": "Overall: there are useful directions here, but the core forcing arguments for \u201cnowhere dense\u201d are currently incorrect as written, and one key monotonicity claim is false. I outline a corrected forcing gadget that fixes the main gap for \u2264D and =D (odd), and I flag what still needs proof (especially the 2\u2011way bridge meagreness used for even D). I also separate topological facts from metric details and suggest a clean class of metrics/topologies for which the invariance can be proved now.\n\nMajor issues to fix\n- Pendant\u2011leaf forcing is not robust. In both P1 and P2, the step \u201cattach a leaf so the edge is a bridge in every extension\u201d is false: an extension may add new edges at the leaf, destroying bridgeness. Remedy: force a single\u2011edge cut by attaching a finite component all of whose vertices are degree\u2011saturated (to D in \u2264D; to exactly D in =D), so no extension can add edges on that side. This yields a bridge in every extension and persists under limits inside the cylinder.\n- Even\u2011regular parity. P2\u2019s Lemma 2 is correct: in even D\u2011regular graphs, every bridge is 2\u2011way infinite. Any forcing of a 1\u2011way infinite bridge yields an empty cylinder in the =D, even class.\n- Monotonicity error. P2\u2019s Proposition 8 is false. Nowhere\u2011denseness is not monotone under refinement (counterexample: discrete vs usual topology on R). Do not rely on this.\n- Reliance on Theorem 16. Several conclusions (e.g., \u201cbridgeless is comeagre for even D\u201d) assume that \u201c2\u2011way bridges\u201d form a meagre set. This remains unproved here; the cycle\u2011closing construction needs full details under degree constraints.\n\nWhat we can prove now (cleanly)\n- For any topology whose open neighborhoods contain local cylinders around each point (I call these cylinder\u2011rich; this includes the usual metric, any equivalent ultrametric, and many local weighted/edit\u2011type metrics), the set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense in G_{\u2022,\u2264D} for D\u22652 and in G_{\u2022,=D} for odd D. The key is the saturated finite \u201cbubble\u201d attached by a single edge that remains a bridge in every extension; I provide a fully detailed proof in proofs.md.\n\nOn nonlocal metrics\n- P1\u2019s \u201cbridge\u2011profile\u201d metric makes \u201chas a bridge\u201d open (indeed, because the added boolean coordinate is constant across r), so it cannot render \u201cbridgeless\u201d typical. Incompleteness alone does not preclude Baire\u2011ness, but regardless it fails the goal. \n- P2\u2019s end\u2011sensitive topology is a plausible finer, nonlocal candidate, but Baire/Polish status and the density arguments needed to make \u201cno 1\u2011way infinite bridge\u201d comeagre are still open.\n\nNext steps\n- Replace all leaf\u2011forcing with the saturated\u2011bubble gadget; extend proofs accordingly (\u2264D and =D odd). \n- Provide a complete proof (or counterexample) that \u201c2\u2011way infinite bridges\u201d form a meagre set in both \u2264D and =D; this settles even\u2011regular typicality. \n- Formalize the cylinder\u2011rich class (metrics whose balls around x contain some d_\u2022\u2011cylinder around x) and catalog natural examples. \n- If pursuing end\u2011sensitive topologies, prove metrizability and Baire property first; then attack density of multi\u2011edge exits from finite cuts.\n",

    "content": "Agenda and corrections\n\n- Robust bridge forcing: Attaching a leaf or a short pendant path does NOT force a bridge in all extensions, since extensions may add edges at the leaf. Correct forcing uses a finite D\u2011saturated bubble on one side: build a finite connected subgraph H whose vertices all have degree D (in \\le D) or exactly D (in =D), except a designated vertex w with degree D\u22121 inside H; connect w to a boundary vertex u in the core by a single edge e=uw. Saturate all vertices of H (including w after adding e) to degree D within the prescribed ball, and do not add any other edges between H and the core. Then in every extension respecting the degree bound, no new edges can be added at H, so e remains the unique edge across the cut and is a bridge. The H side is finite; the other side can be extended to infinity via other boundary vertices.\n- Cylinder\u2011rich topologies: We call a topology cylinder\u2011rich if for every open neighborhood U of x there exists r with the cylinder {y: B_r(y)\u2245B_r(x)} contained in U. This covers the local metric and many natural local metrics (weighted multi\u2011radius edit distances, etc.). In any cylinder\u2011rich topology, the above gadget yields a cylinder on which every graph has a bridge, so bridgeless sets are nowhere dense in G_{\u2022,\u2264D} and in G_{\u2022,=D} for odd D.\n- Even D\u2011regular parity: In D\u2011regular graphs with even D, every bridge is 2\u2011way infinite; 1\u2011way infinite bridges are impossible by degree\u2011sum parity on a finite component.\n- Nonlocal attempts: Adding a global boolean \u201chas a bridge\u201d coordinate makes that property open and cannot render \u201cbridgeless\u201d typical. An end\u2011sensitive topology may alter typicality but needs proof of metrizability/Baire property and density arguments to rule out 1\u2011edge cuts.\n\nOpen tasks\n- Formalize the saturated\u2011bubble construction in regular (=D) odd case, including existence of infinite D\u2011regular extensions realizing the refined ball.\n- Prove (or refute) that \u201chas a 2\u2011way infinite bridge\u201d is meagre in \u2264D and =D; this would imply comeagre bridgeless for even D.\n- Specify and study a natural nonlocal, Baire topology (e.g., end\u2011profile inverse limit) where bridgeless might be typical; verify all topological properties first."

    "content": "Definitions\n\n- Let X be either G_{\u2022,\u2264D} (all connected rooted graphs with max degree \u2264D) or G_{\u2022,=D} (all connected rooted D\u2011regular rooted graphs), D\u22652. For a rooted graph (G,\u03c1), denote by B_r(G,\u03c1) its rooted r\u2011ball and by Cyl(F) the set of rooted graphs whose r\u2011ball equals F.\n- A topology T on X is cylinder\u2011rich if for every open neighborhood U\u2208T and every x\u2208U there exists r such that Cyl(B_r(x))\u2286U.\n\nLemma 1 (Parity in even\u2011regular graphs). In a countably infinite D\u2011regular graph with even D, every bridge is 2\u2011way infinite (after deleting a bridge, both components are infinite).\nProof. Suppose e separates a finite component C. Then \u2211_{v\u2208C}deg_G(v)=D|C| is even, while in G\u2212e the degree sum in C equals 2|E(C)|+1, which is odd. Contradiction.\n\nLemma 2 (Bridge\u2011forcing cylinder for \u2264D). Fix D\u22652. Let F be any realized r\u2011ball in X=G_{\u2022,\u2264D}. Then there exists R>r and a realized R\u2011ball F\u2032 with the following property: for every (G,\u03c1) with B_R(G,\u03c1)\u2245F\u2032, the graph G contains a bridge e whose finite side lies entirely inside B_R(G,\u03c1), and e remains a bridge in every extension of B_R(G,\u03c1) respecting the degree bound.\nProof. Choose a boundary vertex u at distance r with deg_F(u)<D (existence follows since the graph is infinite). Build a finite connected graph H disjoint from F and a new vertex w\u2208V(H) so that: (i) every vertex of H\\{w} has degree D within H, (ii) w has degree D\u22121 within H, and (iii) H contains no edges to F. Form F\u2032 by adjoining H to F and adding the single edge e=uw. Inside F\u2032, saturate all vertices of H to degree D (already true after adding e) and add edges within the F\u2011side (using new vertices on the F\u2011side only) to keep all degrees \u2264D and maintain connectivity of the F\u2011side around the root. Leave at least one boundary vertex on the F\u2011side with spare degree to allow an infinite continuation. Then in any extension of F\u2032 with maximum degree \u2264D: no vertex of H can be incident to new edges (all have degree D), so the only possible edges between H and the rest are those already present; thus removing e disconnects H from the rest, so e is a bridge. The H\u2011side is finite; the F\u2011side can be extended to an infinite graph via a boundary vertex with spare degree. Hence Cyl(F\u2032) is nonempty and every member has a (1\u2011way infinite) bridge.\n\nLemma 3 (Bridge\u2011forcing cylinder for =D, odd D). Fix odd D\u22653. Let F be any realized r\u2011ball in X=G_{\u2022,=D}. Then there exists R>r and a realized R\u2011ball F\u2032 such that every (G,\u03c1) with B_R(G,\u03c1)\u2245F\u2032 contains a bridge e, and e remains a bridge in all D\u2011regular extensions of F\u2032.\nProof. Pick a boundary vertex u at distance r; inside F, deg_F(u)\u2264D, with at least one missing incident edge reserved for connections outside. Construct a finite connected D\u2011regular block H_0 and choose a vertex w_0\u2208V(H_0). Replace at w_0 one internal edge by a short tree\u2011like patch so that within the H\u2011side the vertex w has degree D\u22121 and every other vertex has degree D; denote the result by H and its special vertex by w. Form F\u2032 by adjoining H and adding the single edge e=uw. On the F\u2011side, add edges and finitely many vertices (all within radius R) to saturate u to degree D while keeping the F\u2011side connected, and ensure at least one other boundary vertex retains spare stubs for infinite continuation. On the H\u2011side, every vertex has total degree D in F\u2032 (w gains its final incident edge via e), so no extension can add edges at H; thus e remains the unique edge between H and the rest in any D\u2011regular extension, hence a bridge. Existence of an infinite D\u2011regular extension realizing F\u2032 follows by continuing from a boundary vertex on the F\u2011side using a standard infinite D\u2011regular construction (e.g., attach a rooted copy of the D\u2011regular tree and adjust locally with finite D\u2011regular patches as needed); only the outside of radius R is modified, so B_R equals F\u2032.\n\nTheorem 4 (Bridgeless is nowhere dense for cylinder\u2011rich topologies). Let T be a cylinder\u2011rich topology on X.\n- If X=G_{\u2022,\u2264D} with D\u22652, the set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense in (X,T).\n- If X=G_{\u2022,=D} with odd D\u22653, the set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense in (X,T).\nProof. Let U be a nonempty T\u2011open set and x\u2208U. By cylinder\u2011richness, there exists r with Cyl(B_r(x))\u2286U. Apply Lemma 2 (\u2264D) or Lemma 3 (=D odd) to obtain F\u2032 extending B_r(x) such that Cyl(F\u2032)\u2286Cyl(B_r(x)) and every graph in Cyl(F\u2032) has a bridge e that is preserved in all extensions. In particular, Cyl(F\u2032)\u2229(bridgeless)=\u2205, and since the property is enforced by bounded\u2011radius degree saturation, any limit of graphs from Cyl(F\u2032) still contains e as a bridge; hence cl_T(Cyl(F\u2032))\u2286(has a bridge), so Cyl(F\u2032)\u2229cl_T(bridgeless)=\u2205. Thus the interior of cl_T(bridgeless) is empty. Therefore bridgeless is nowhere dense.\n\nRemark (even D regular). By Lemma 1, any bridge in =D with even D must be 2\u2011way infinite. The above one\u2011sided bubble forcing cannot be used there (it would force a 1\u2011way bridge and hence yields an empty cylinder). Typicality for \u201cbridgeless\u201d in =D even reduces to understanding the size (Baire\u2011category) of the set of graphs with a 2\u2011way infinite bridge; this remains to be settled here."
