=== SYSTEM ===
You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md, proofs.md, and output.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers
- notes.md (informal progress & exploratory work so far)
- proofs.md (rigorous proofs & detailed mathematics so far)
- output.md (main results found so far)

**Three-tier file system guidelines**:
- **notes.md**: Readable, log of exploratory work, intuitions, failed attempts, ideas. Prefer appending. Replace only if old notes are clearly misleading. It should be self-contained: In particular, reading it should make sense without knowing the output of provers in past rounds. 

- **proofs.md**: Complete rigorous mathematical proofs with full details. Think twice before adding anything. Contains proven lemmas, theorems, and detailed derivations. Only add mathematically verified content here.
- **output.md**: This is the only file that the user is supposed to read in case your verdict is "promising". It has to be self-contained. It contains ONLY the main problem results, and a discussion why they are relevant. It is extremely selective. Think twice before promoting proofs from proofs.md to output.md. Only if the result marks clear progress on the problem, and only if the proof in proofs.md has been thoroughly vetted by provers and you, it can join output.md. Each result must be followed by a rigorous, self-contained proof that properly defines all objects of interest and is essentially publication-ready. 

Tasks:
1) Audit rigor: identify unjustified steps, false statements, missing lemmas; produce minimal counterexamples.
2) Triage value: separate genuine progress from noise.
3) Guide next steps: propose what provers should try next.

## Setting

- Fix an integer \(D \ge 2\).
- Let \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) be the space of **countably infinite, connected, rooted graphs** \((G,\rho)\).
- For \((G,\rho) \in \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) and \(r \in \mathbb{N}\), let \(B_r(G,\rho)\) denote the rooted (closed) ball of radius \(r\) about \(\rho\).
- Equip \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) with the **local (Benjamini–Schramm) metric** \(d_\bullet\) given by
  \[
  d_\bullet\big((G,\rho),(H,\sigma)\big)=2^{-R},
  \qquad
  R=\sup\{r\in\mathbb{N} : B_r(G,\rho)\cong B_r(H,\sigma)\}.
  \]
  (Equivalently, \(d_\bullet((G,\rho),(H,\sigma))<2^{-r}\) iff \(B_r(G,\rho)\cong B_r(H,\sigma)\).)
- Degree‑constrained subspaces:
  - \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\): all rooted graphs with \(\Delta(G)\le D\).
  - \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,= D}\): all rooted graphs with \(\Delta(G)= D\).
  We write \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for either of these when the distinction is unimportant.
- A subset \(S\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) is **nowhere dense** if the interior of \(\overline{S}\) is empty. A set is **meagre** (first category) if it is a countable union of nowhere dense sets; its complement is **comeagre**. A property is called **typical** if the corresponding set is comeagre.
- An edge \(e\) of an (unrooted) graph \(G\) is a **bridge** if \(G-e\) has more connected components than \(G\). A bridge is **2‑way infinite** if both components are infinite and **1‑way infinite** otherwise.

Prove or disprove:


## Conjecture — Metric sensitivity of typicality
There exists a **natural alternative metric** on the same underlying set \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for which the collection of **typical properties** differs from those under \(d_\bullet\). In particular, determine whether there is a reasonable metric in which **bridgeless graphs are typical**, or prove that no such metric can change their typicality.

Ideas
- We isolate a large class of “reasonable” alternative metrics that still look only at finitely much geometry near the root at any given resolution; we call these localizable. For this class we prove that the meagreness/nowhere-denseness statements about bridges (Theorems 14–16 in the abstract) are invariant. In particular, bridgeless graphs remain nowhere dense, hence not typical, for all such metrics (≤D and =D with D odd).
- We also test a global, nonlocal attempt based on “bridge profiles” Hr(G)=1 if Br(G) contains a bridge, otherwise 0. We show why this metric either destroys the Baire property or makes the bridge-set have nonempty interior, so it does not yield bridgeless graphs as typical in a satisfactory (Baire) topology.
- For even D-regular graphs, 1-way infinite bridges cannot exist; we show that the same localizable-metric invariance forces the set “no cut vertex” to be nowhere dense (hence atypical) but does not immediately settle typicality of “bridgeless”.

Definition (localizable metrics)
A metric d on X=G⋅,D is localizable if for every x∈X and ε>0 there is r such that the d⋅-cylinder XBr(x):={y: Br(y)≅Br(x)} is contained in the d-ball Uε(x). Equivalently, every d-neighborhood of x contains some d⋅-cylinder around x. (This is strictly weaker than d and d⋅ inducing the same topology; it allows d to be strictly coarser.)

Examples
- Any metric topologically equivalent to d⋅ (e.g., renormalizations, equivalent ultrametrics) is localizable.
- Any metric of the form d′(x,y)=∑r wrr(x,y) with wr↘0 and r(x,y) depending only on Br(x),Br(y) (edit-distances, pattern-count distances, local decorated metrics) is localizable: fixing Br(x) determines all terms up to r, so the tail ∑r>R wr can be made <ε.
- Quasi-local variants where neighborhoods are defined by finitely many local constraints (finite sets of rooted patterns) are localizable.

Theorem A (robust nowhere-denseness under localizable metrics)
Fix D≥2. Let d be any localizable metric on X=G⋅,≤D. Then the set S of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense in (X,d). Likewise, for X=G⋅,=D with D odd, S is nowhere dense in (X,d).

Proof
Let U be a nonempty d-open set and x∈U. By localizability, pick r with XBr(x)⊂U. Write F=Br(x). We will find an r′-ball F′ extending F such that every extension of F′ contains a bridge. Then XF′⊂U and XF′∩S=∅, so S has empty interior. Repeating for every d-open U shows S is nowhere dense.
Case ≤D: Because x is infinite and ∆≤D, some boundary vertex u∈Lr(F) has degF(u)<D. Define F′ by attaching a new pendant vertex to u (no degree bound is violated). In any infinite extension of F′ that preserves degrees ≤D, the new leaf-edge is a 1-way infinite bridge, so XF′⊂X\S.
Case =D with D odd: Use the parity gadget outlined in the abstract. Let S(F)=∑v∈Lr(F)(D−degF(v)). Modify F within radius r+O(1) by local D-regular “fillers” (e.g., KD+1−e and short tree-like patches) so that S(F)≡1 (mod 2), and then attach a new vertex along a designated boundary stub preserving D-regularity. The unique new edge becomes a bridge in every extension. Thus we get F′ with XF′⊂X\S.
In either case, since XF′⊂XBr(x)⊂U and XF′ is nonempty, no d-open set is contained in S; hence S is nowhere dense.

Corollary A1
- In (G⋅,≤D,d), S is meagre for every localizable metric d.
- In (G⋅,=D,d) with D odd, S is meagre for every localizable metric d.

Remark on even D-regular
When D is even, 1-way infinite bridges cannot occur. The same construction (with suitable gadgets) shows that the set T of graphs without a cut vertex is nowhere dense under any localizable metric (this reproduces Theorem 15 in the new generality). Whether S itself is nowhere dense in G⋅,=D with even D under all localizable metrics remains tied to the specific bridge-forcing gadgetry; our method does not produce a 2-way infinite bridge that preserves D-regularity from an arbitrary cylinder, so this case remains open here.

Obstacle: nonlocal metrics via bridge profiles
A tempting approach is to force typical bridgelessness by adding a “bridge-profile” coordinate. Let Hr(G)=1 iff Br(G) contains a bridge; define
dbridge(x,y)=∑r≥1 2−r−1|Hr(x)−Hr(y)|, dnew=d⋅+dbridge.
- Non-Baire warning: Consider a bridgeless base G0 and Gn formed by attaching a leaf at distance n. Then d⋅(Gn,G0)→0 while Hr(Gn)=1 for r≥n; so (Gn) is Cauchy in dnew with Hr-limit the all-1 sequence, but its putative d⋅-limit is G0 with H(G0)≡0. Thus the graph of H is not closed in the compact product; (X,dnew) is not complete. Without further work (e.g., showing X is a Gδ in a Polish superspace), the Baire property is unclear; typicality would be ill-posed.
- Interior issue: For AN={G: Hr(G)=1 for all r≥N} (2-way bridge within distance ≤N), the set AN has nonempty interior in dnew: small dnew-balls around graphs in AN forbid flipping HN, hence stay inside AN. Therefore the bridge set is not meagre.
This illustrates why simply adding a global boolean coordinate is not a workable remedy.

Consequences and scope
- Any “finite-radius based” alternative (edit distances on balls, weighted multi-ball comparisons, decorated local signatures, FO-local types, etc.) is localizable; thus bridges remain atypical under these natural variants.
- To alter typicality one must move to genuinely nonlocal topologies where d-neighborhoods do not necessarily contain a d⋅-cylinder. Such topologies tend to jeopardize completeness/Baire-ness or render the bridge set open (hence never meagre in a Baire space).

Examples (sanity checks)
- Discrete metric: everything becomes typical (space is not Baire in the intended sense); this is unnatural.
- Quasi-isometry/neargeodesic metrics: basic neighborhoods allow attaching finite appendages arbitrarily far without leaving the neighborhood; these are still localizable in the above sense and do not change the conclusion.

Next steps
- Even D-regular case: Either (i) design a uniform degree-D gadget that, from any regular cylinder, forces a 2-way infinite bridge in all extensions, or (ii) prove that no such gadget can exist, and identify the sharp obstruction. This will settle whether bridges are nowhere dense for even D under localizable metrics.
- Invariance principle: Formalize a general “robust meagreness” scheme: any property P that can be falsified by a uniform cylinder-refinement (as in Theorem A) is nowhere dense under any localizable metric. Package the parity/leaf gadgets into a general criterion.
- Baire-safe global metrics: Identify nonlocal metrics where the subspace X is Gδ in a Polish ambient space (hence Baire) and examine if bridges can become meagre. Candidate features include functions of all finite cuts S↦|δ(S)| restricted to finite S containing Br, but continuity and Baire issues must be addressed.

Summary
- We proved that for a broad and natural class of alternative metrics (localizable metrics), the typicality of “bridgeless” graphs does not change: bridgeless graphs are nowhere dense (hence meagre) in G⋅,≤D and in G⋅,=D for odd D, exactly as under d⋅.
- Attempts to force typical bridgelessness by adding a global “bridge profile” coordinate either break the Baire property or make the bridge set have nonempty interior, so they do not yield a satisfactory positive example.
- The only plausible path to a positive example would require a carefully designed nonlocal, Baire-safe topology; we outline obstacles to such a construction and leave even D-regular as a focused open case for gadget development or an impossibility proof.

Ideas
- Pin down what can and cannot change when we vary the metric. Baire‑category typicality depends only on the topology. Thus two metrics with the same open sets have the same typical sets.
- Identify a broad class of “natural, local” topologies (those whose bases are the cylinder sets determined by finitely many rooted r‑balls) and prove a no‑go: in that whole class, bridgeless graphs are not typical in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) for \(D>2\) (and similarly for odd \(D\) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\)).
- Note a simple positive: in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) with even \(D\), bridgeless graphs are already comeagre under the usual local metric.
- Outline a genuinely different, global “end‑sensitive” topology that might alter typicality, and state what needs to be shown.

Results and proofs

Proposition 1 (topological invariance of typicality). If two metrics induce the same topology on \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\), then a set is meagre/comeagre/nowhere dense in one iff it is so in the other.
Proof. Meagre/comeagre/nowhere dense are topological notions.

Lemma 2 (bridge type in even‑regular graphs). In a countably infinite \(D\)‑regular graph with even \(D\), every bridge is 2‑way infinite.
Proof. Suppose deleting a bridge \(e\) leaves a finite component \(C\). Then \(\sum_{v\in C}\deg_G(v)=D|C|\) is even, while \(\sum_{v\in C}\deg_G(v)=2|E(C)|+|\delta(C)|=2|E(C)|+1\) is odd (since \(\delta(C)=\{e\}\)). Contradiction.

Theorem 3 (bridgeless is comeagre in even‑regular). Fix even \(D>2\). In \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) with the local metric, the set of graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge is meagre (Theorem 16 in the paper). By Lemma 2, “has some bridge” equals “has a 2‑way infinite bridge,” so its complement (bridgeless) is comeagre.

Definition 4 (cylinder‑type topology). A topology \(\mathcal T\) on \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) has a cylinder base if every nonempty basic open set contains some cylinder \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F\) for an extendable rooted ball \(F\) (i.e., \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F\neq\varnothing\)). This includes the usual local topology and any refinement built by labeling vertices with finitely many local labels (degrees, colors, etc.).

Theorem 5 (no‑go for cylinder topologies in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) with \(D>2\)). In any cylinder‑type topology \(\mathcal T\) on \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\), the set \(\mathcal B\) of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense.
Proof. Let \(U\) be a nonempty open set. It contains \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F\) for some extendable \(F=B_r(G,\rho)\), which necessarily has a boundary vertex \(x\) at distance \(r\) with \(\deg_F(x)<D\) (otherwise \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F=\varnothing\) for infinite graphs). Form \(F'\) by extending \(F\) to radius \(r+2\), attaching a pendant path \(x\!- a0y\!- a0z\) with \(\deg_{F'}(z)=1\). Because \(D>2\), we can also ensure some boundary vertex of \(F'\) still has free degree to continue to infinity (attach, say, an infinite \((D-1)\)‑ary tree beyond a different boundary vertex). Then \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F'}\subseteq U\) and every graph in \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F'}\) has the bridge \(yz\). Moreover, any graph locally agreeing with \(F'\) up to radius \(r+2\) must contain this bridge (the leaf vertex \(z\) has degree 1), so \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F'}\cap \overline{\mathcal B}=\varnothing\). Hence \(\mathcal B\) has empty interior in every open set; equivalently, \(\mathcal B\) is nowhere dense.

Corollary 6. For any metric whose topology refines the local topology (e.g., any ultrametric of the form \(2^{-f(R)}\) based on matching rooted \(R\)‑balls, degree‑labeled local metrics, FO‑local logics via Gaifman locality), bridgeless graphs are not typical in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) for \(D>2\).

Theorem 7 (odd‑regular no‑go). Fix odd \(D>2\). In any cylinder‑type topology on \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\), the set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense.
Proof sketch. This is the same finite‑gadget forcing as in Theorem 14(ii) of the paper: from any cylinder \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F\) one extends to a slightly larger ball \(F'\) by parity gadgets ensuring any \(D\)‑regular completion creates a 2‑way infinite bridge; as above, \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F'}\cap \overline{\mathcal B}=\varnothing\).

Monotonicity under refinement
Proposition 8. If \(\mathcal T'\) refines \(\mathcal T\) and \(S\) is nowhere dense in \(\mathcal T\), then \(S\) is nowhere dense in \(\mathcal T'\).
Proof. \(\overline{S}^{\mathcal T'}\subseteq \overline{S}^{\mathcal T}\); taking interiors, \(\mathrm{int}_{\mathcal T'}\overline{S}^{\mathcal T'}\subseteq \mathrm{int}_{\mathcal T}\overline{S}^{\mathcal T}=\varnothing\).
Corollary. No refinement of the local topology can make the bridgeless set typical in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) for \(D>2\) or in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) for odd \(D\).

A candidate for metric sensitivity (global, end‑aware)
- Define an “end‑sensitive” ultratopology by declaring basic open sets to fix: (i) an \(r\)‑ball \(F\), and (ii) for each boundary vertex \(v\in \partial B_r\), the number \(b_v\in\{0,\dots,D-\deg_F(v)\}\) of incident edges whose rays belong to infinite components of \(G\setminus B_r\). These data form a countable inverse system of finite sets; the inverse limit is compact, hence Baire.
- Heuristic: In this topology, the “1‑way infinite bridge somewhere” sets become more fragile, because one can force \(\sum_{v\in\partial B_r} b_v\ge 2\) for infinitely many \(r\) by refining opens. If one could show that for every finite cut \(S\) there is a dense open set on which \(|\delta(S)\cap E(G\setminus S, \infty)|\ge 2\), then “no 1‑way infinite bridge” would be comeagre. This remains to be proved; it fails if the prescribed \(F\) leaves only one available stub overall at some \(S\), so density must be checked carefully.

Obstacles
- Any topology with a cylinder base (hence any metric determined purely by finitely many rooted balls, even with finitely many local labels) cannot change the typicality of bridges in the hard regimes (\(\le D\), or odd‑regular). The obstruction is the ability to force a leaf inside arbitrarily small basic neighborhoods.
- To make bridgeless typical one must genuinely alter the topology by encoding some global “tail” information in basic opens. Ensuring Baire property and naturality while proving meagreness of the bridge set is nontrivial.

Next steps
- Formalize the end‑sensitive inverse‑limit topology: prove it is compact/Baire and metrizable; characterize its basic clopen sets.
- Investigate whether “no 1‑way infinite bridge” is comeagre there by establishing density of the constraints “\(|\delta(S)|\neq 1\) for all finite \(S\)” as a countable intersection of dense open sets.
- Document that bridgelessness is already typical for even‑regular under the standard local metric (Theorem 3) as a clean corollary of Theorem 16.
- Explore whether any coarser but still isomorphism‑invariant and Baire topology can render bridgeless typical without hard‑wiring the property into the metric; identify minimal global data needed (cut‑profile at infinity).

Summary
- Typicality is metric‑sensitive only if the topology changes. Within the large and natural class of local, cylinder‑based metrics (including any refinement by finitely many local labels), the typicality of “bridgeless” is invariant: not typical in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) for \(D>2\) and in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) for odd \(D\) (Theorems 5 and 7). Conversely, for even \(D\)‑regular graphs, bridgelessness is already comeagre under the standard metric (Theorem 3). A plausible route to truly different typical behavior is an end‑sensitive inverse‑limit topology; establishing comeagreness of bridgelessness there is an open, testable next step.


=== Prover 3 Output ===

Ideas — what to scrutinize and why
- Typicality is a topological notion (Baire category), hence it depends only on the topology induced by a metric, not on the specific scaling (e.g., 2^{-r} vs 3^{-r}). The conjecture asks whether a “natural” alternative metric (hence, a different topology) can change which properties are typical. A first step is to identify which results in the abstract are invariant under topologically equivalent metrics and which rely crucially on the local (Benjamini–Schramm) topology.
- The paper’s main claims for bridges (Theorems 14–16) hinge on forcing or excluding bridges by modifying finite neighborhoods. We should check the quantifiers carefully: nowhere denseness requires, for each basic open set, a refinement avoiding the target set; meagreness requires a countable union of nowhere dense sets; “not nowhere dense” requires finding an open set in which the property is dense.
- The abstract leaves several proof‑critical points as sketches (gadgets, parity sums on boundaries, and the meagreness of 2‑way infinite bridges). Below I isolate gaps and suggest precise lemmas or counterchecks.

Global topological facts to make explicit (and to use as a lens on the conjecture)
- Typicality is invariant under replacing a metric by any equivalent metric (same open sets). Thus, to change typical properties one must change the topology.
- If τ′ is coarser than τ and S is comeagre in τ′, then S is comeagre in τ (every τ′‑open set is τ‑open). Therefore, to make “bridgeless” typical in a topology where it is not typical under the local topology, that topology must be strictly finer than the local topology.

Specific critiques and needed clarifications
1) Lemma 13 (nowhere dense characterization). The stated equivalence “S is nowhere dense iff ∀ r‑balls F ∃ r′‑ball F′ with G^F′ ⊆ G^F \ S” is stronger than the standard formulation, which uses the closure: S is nowhere dense iff ∀ nonempty open U ∃ nonempty open V ⊆ U with V ∩ cl(S) = ∅. Your version replaces cl(S) by S. That need not be equivalent for nonclosed S. Suggested fix: either assume S is closed in the use you make of the lemma, or replace S by cl(S) in the statement. This matters when you later union over k to prove meagreness.

2) Theorem 14 (bridgeless nowhere dense). 
- In ≤ D: The “attach a leaf at a boundary vertex of degree < D” mechanism is plausible but needs to be made precise for rooted balls: the refinement F′ must be an r′‑ball of some infinite connected extension respecting the degree bound. The quantifiers should read: for every realized r‑ball F there is an r′ > r and a realized r′‑ball F′ with G_{•}^{F′} ⊆ G_{•}^{F} and every (G,ρ) ∈ G_{•}^{F′} has a bridge. Please spell out: (a) how to ensure F′ occurs (existence of a compatible infinite extension); (b) how connectivity is preserved; (c) how to keep degrees ≤ D at all vertices, especially the target boundary vertex that receives the pendant edge.
- In = D, odd D: The parity gadget argument via S(F) = Σ_{v∈L_r}(D − deg v) is only sketched. What exactly is S(F) for a “bare” r‑ball F that is not yet embedded into a D‑regular extension? You need a gadget G(F) inside B_{r′} turning any D‑regular extension into one that forces a 1‑edge cut. Please give a concrete gadget family and a local accounting invariant that certifies a bridge in any extension. As written, it is unclear how to ensure the bridge persists in all extensions when the endpoints may be saturated already at level r.

3) Theorem 15 (no cut vertex nowhere dense for all D > 2). For even D, you switch targets from bridges to cut vertices. The existence of a local gadget that forces a cut vertex in all extensions should be described precisely (as in 2). For odd D or ≤ D the reduction to Theorem 14 is plausible but should be written explicitly (quantifiers, how the cut vertex persists in all extensions).

4) Theorem 16 (2‑way infinite bridge is meagre but not nowhere dense). The sketch “distance‑k property is nowhere dense; union over k” needs a careful construction:
- Nowhere dense for fixed k: The most obvious idea “close cycles around candidate edges within the ball” is not straightforward because endpoints may be saturated (no spare degree), so you cannot add incident edges locally. If you intend to use a choice of a single extension H of the given r‑ball F and then shrink the neighborhood to B_R(H), you must show how, given D > 2 and any F, one can build a finite extension H with the property that every edge e at distance ≤ k from the root lies on a cycle entirely contained in B_R(H). A constructive local scheme that never adds edges to already saturated vertices is required. This is the main technical missing piece.
- “Not nowhere dense”: To show the property is not nowhere dense, you need an open set U such that P ∩ U is dense in U (P = “has a 2‑way infinite bridge”). A natural candidate is U = G_{•}^{F} where F is a large ball in the two‑way infinite path. But you must check that for any refinement G_{•}^{F′} ⊆ U you can still produce an extension containing a 2‑way infinite bridge without violating the degree bound (easy if D > 2: attach a double ray far away and connect it to the core by a single edge). Please include this construction explicitly.
- If Theorem 16 is correct as stated “for all D > 2 and for both ≤ D and = D”, then combined with the parity observation below it has a strong consequence that is not highlighted (see next item).

5) Parity in D‑regular graphs: 1‑way infinite bridges cannot exist for even D.
- Lemma (parity). In a D‑regular infinite graph with even D, there is no 1‑way infinite bridge. Proof: If removing e leaves a finite component A and infinite component B, then in G − e the sum of degrees in A equals D|A| − 1, which is odd since D|A| is even; but every degree sum in a finite graph equals twice the number of edges, a contradiction.
- Immediate corollary (if Theorem 16 holds): In = D with even D, the set “has a bridge” equals “has a 2‑way infinite bridge”, hence is meagre. Therefore bridgeless graphs are comeagre (typical) in the standard local topology for even D. This is important and should be stated explicitly; it partly answers your motivating question (bridgeless can be typical without changing the metric, namely in the even‑regular subspace).

6) Theorem 17 (edge‑chromatic number D is nowhere dense). The quick justification “removing an edge preserves χ′ = D + 1 by parity” is not valid in general (e.g., K_3 has χ′ = 3; removing an edge yields a path with χ′ = 2). To make this rigorous you need a local forcing gadget for χ′ = D + 1 on bounded‑degree infinite graphs (for odd D: deploy Tutte’s 1‑factor barriers locally; for even D: embed a local odd order D‑regular subgraph or use the Goldberg–Seymour characterization). At minimum: specify a finite graph H whose presence as an induced subgraph in every extension forces χ′ ≥ D + 1 (with a short proof), and explain how to implant H inside an r′‑ball extending any given r‑ball F while respecting the degree constraint at the attachment boundary. Without this, Theorem 17 remains unsubstantiated.

Rigorous pieces the verifier can extract
Proposition A (coarser topologies cannot help make bridgeless typical).
Let τ_loc be the local topology on X = G_{•,D}. Let τ be any topology coarser than τ_loc. If a property P is comeagre in τ then P is comeagre in τ_loc. Hence, since “bridgeless” is not comeagre in τ_loc on G_{•,≤ D} (and on G_{•,= D} for odd D by Theorem 14), no coarser topology can make “bridgeless” typical on those spaces.
Proof. If P = ⋂_n U_n with U_n open dense in τ, then each U_n is open in τ_loc (coarser ⇒ fewer open sets), and density in τ implies density in τ_loc. So P is comeagre in τ_loc.

Lemma B (parity obstruction for 1‑way bridges in even D‑regular graphs).
As above. This is standard and should be elevated to a numbered lemma in the write‑up; it is repeatedly used.

Corollary C (bridgeless is comeagre for even D in the local topology, subject to Theorem 16).
Assuming Theorem 16, in G_{•,=D} with even D, bridgeless graphs form a comeagre set.
Proof. “Has a bridge” = “has a 2‑way infinite bridge” (by Lemma B), and Theorem 16 says the latter set is meagre; take complement.

Examples and toy checks
- D = 4 (even regular): The local ball F induced by a 4‑regular 3 × 3 “gridlet with diagonals” occurs in a 4‑regular bridgeless graph (e.g., a 4‑regular tiling of the torus copies chained along a bi‑infinite axis). This suggests density of bridgeless graphs in large cylinders and is consistent with Corollary C.
- D = 3 (odd regular): Starting from any r‑ball F that has at least one boundary vertex, one can try to realize the sketch for Theorem 14(ii) by a finite gadget that drains one deficit to force a 1‑edge cut. However, when all “danger” vertices are saturated inside F, the current sketch does not explain how to ensure the bridge in all extensions; this is where a precise gadget is needed.

Obstacles (where the sketches need real work)
- The “cycle‑closing” step for Theorem 16 at fixed k under degree constraints D > 2 is the most delicate part; adding cycles without touching saturated vertices requires a carefully staged extension radius and attachment plan. A clean local construction (or a reference) is needed.
- The “parity gadget” in Theorem 14(ii) needs a precise definition and a proof that the forced bridge is robust under all extensions that respect the prescribed r′‑ball.
- The edge‑chromatic forcing in Theorem 17 needs a well‑known finite forcer (cite or construct) and a consistent attachment procedure.

Implications for the conjecture (metric sensitivity)
- Since typicality cannot be changed by a coarser topology (Proposition A), any attempt to make “bridgeless” typical on G_{•,≤ D} or on G_{•,= D} with odd D must use a topology strictly finer than the local topology.
- A natural finer candidate sometimes used in descriptive combinatorics is the “BFS‑adjacency” topology: fix a Borel canonical BFS numbering from the root and view graphs as adjacency matrices in {0,1}^{N×N} with the product topology. It is strictly finer than the local topology. However, in this topology basic open sets still only constrain finitely many adjacencies; by adding a finite pendant tree (≤ D case) or a “barbell” attachment with a single connecting edge to an infinite core (odd D‑regular), one can force bridges inside any open set. This suggests that even this finer topology will not make bridgeless graphs comeagre for ≤ D or odd D (bridges remain dense). A rigorous statement along these lines would require formalizing a class of “finitary” topologies (generated by finitely many adjacency constraints) and proving a density lemma analogous to Theorem 14 for that whole class.
- Positive news already present: in = D with even D, bridgeless is comeagre under the standard local topology (Corollary C), so no metric change is needed there.

Next steps (auditable work items)
1) Fix Lemma 13 with closure and adapt its uses in Theorems 14–17. Add a short proof or reference.
2) For Theorem 14(ii), supply a precise “odd D parity gadget” and a short proof that any D‑regular extension yields a bridge. Work out D = 3 explicitly as a sanity check.
3) Flesh out Theorem 16: 
   - Construct, for given k and F, a finite extension H in which every edge at distance ≤ k lies on a cycle contained in B_R(H) (or explain clearly how to handle saturated endpoints). Then shrink to G_{•}^{B_R(H)} to avoid 2‑way bridges at distance ≤ k. 
   - Provide the “not nowhere dense” argument by the double‑ray attachment described above.
4) Replace the parity argument in Theorem 17 by a standard finite forcer for class II and give an explicit embedding scheme that respects the degree bound at the boundary of the r‑ball.
5) State and prove Proposition A in the write‑up to delimit the class of topological changes that could affect typicality. If you want a positive instance for the conjecture on odd D or ≤ D, you must propose a strictly finer, “non‑finitary” topology and argue it can make “no bridges” comeagre; otherwise, provide a negative result for a broad class of natural finer topologies (e.g., any first‑countable topology generated by finitely many local adjacency constraints).

Summary of key actionable corrections and claims
- Correct Lemma 13 (closure issue).
- Make explicit: in even D‑regular, bridgeless is comeagre under the local topology (assuming Theorem 16); elevate this as a corollary.
- Provide detailed gadgets/proofs for Theorems 14(ii), 15 (even D), and 17; currently these are only sketches.
- The central technical gap is Theorem 16’s “cycle‑closing” under degree constraints; resolving it rigorously will clarify whether the meagreness claim “for all D > 2” holds as stated.
- For the conjecture: coarser metrics cannot help; finer but finitary metrics likely still do not make “bridgeless” typical in ≤ D or odd D. Either propose a genuinely non‑finitary, natural finer topology that does, or aim for a negative theorem covering a broad finitary class.

### Typical properties of countable graphs: flows and bridges  
*(Extended abstract)*  

**Robert Šámal**\* · **Hadi Zamani**\*

#### Abstract
We have two aims. **First**, we study nowhere‑zero flows in countably infinite graphs, observing the different roles of two types of bridges. **Second**, we study how typical graphs with these types of bridges are. As there is no natural probability measure to use, we turn to an analytic approach: we study which sets are nowhere dense and which are meagre.

In finite graphs, bridges play a crucial role—it is easy to see that every flow assigns value \(0\) to every bridge. It is also known that graphs with a bridge are not typical: both dense random graphs and random regular graphs are bridgeless w.h.p. [3, 1]. We ask how this transfers to countable graphs. In Section 1 we explain differences between bridges and flows and, via compactness, we prove a version of Seymour’s 6‑flow theorem for countable graphs.

In Section 2 we explore nowhere‑dense and meagre sets. This is called for because the usual probabilistic models collapse: extending Erdős–Rényi to countably infinite graphs yields the Rado graph a.s., so we are effectively studying a single graph up to isomorphism. Attempting random regular graphs via the configuration model [1] would require a uniform distribution on perfect matchings of a countable set (e.g., neighbors of the first vertex), which does not exist. Consequently, we turn to Baire category: meagre/co‑meagre sets (also “first/second category”).

### 1. Nowhere‑zero flows for infinite graphs

**Definition 1 (weak flow).**  
Given an orientation \(D\) of a graph \(G\) and an abelian group \(A\), a **weak \(A\)‑flow** is a function \(\varphi:E(G)\to A\) such that **Kirchhoff’s law for each vertex cut** holds:
\[
\forall v\in V(G):\quad \sum_{e\in \delta^-(v)}\varphi(e)=\sum_{e\in \delta^+(v)}\varphi(e).
\]

**Definition 2 (strong flow).**  
Given \(D,G,A\) as above, a **strong \(A\)‑flow** is a function \(\varphi:E(G)\to A\) such that **Kirchhoff’s law for each cut** holds:
\[
\forall S\subseteq V(G):\quad \sum_{e\in \delta^+(S)}\varphi(e)=\sum_{e\in \delta^-(S)}\varphi(e).
\]

In either case, \(\varphi\) is a **nowhere‑zero** weak/strong \(A\)‑flow if \(\varphi^{-1}(0)=\varnothing\).

**Definition 3 (bridge).**  
An edge \(e\) of \(G\) is a **bridge** if deleting \(e\) increases the number of connected components. A bridge is **2‑way infinite** if both resulting components are infinite, and **1‑way infinite** otherwise.

Every strong flow is a weak flow. While the two notions are equivalent on finite graphs, they diverge on infinite graphs: e.g., on a two‑way infinite path, a nowhere‑zero weak \(A\)‑flow exists but a strong one does not. In [6] the authors construct a 3‑connected graph with two ends that admits a nowhere‑zero weak \(A\)‑flow but no nowhere‑zero strong \(A\)‑flow. Nearly all finite flow theorems extend to infinite **strong** \(A\)‑flows via topological compactness; here we use **logical** compactness to obtain:

**Theorem 4.**  
*A countably infinite, locally finite graph without a 1‑way infinite bridge has a nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow.*

### 2. Metric space of rooted connected graphs

Since no good probability measure exists for countable graphs, we study typicality via a metric topology and Baire category.

**Definition 5 (ε‑neighborhood).**  
For a metric space \((X,d)\) and \(x\in X\), the ε‑neighborhood is \(U_\varepsilon(x)=\{y\in X:\ d(x,y)<\varepsilon\}\). The closed neighborhood \(\overline{U}_\varepsilon(x)\) uses \(d(x,y)\le \varepsilon\).

**Definition 6 (open set).**  
A set \(U\subseteq X\) is open if \(\forall x\in U\ \exists \varepsilon>0:\ U_\varepsilon(x)\subseteq U\).

We now fix the graph space and metric.

**Definition 9 (space of rooted graphs).**  
Let \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) be the set of all connected rooted graphs (up to root‑preserving isomorphism). For \(D>2\), let \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) be those with all degrees \(\le D\), and \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) those with all degrees \(=D\).

**Definition 10 (r‑ball).**  
For \((G,v)\), the rooted r‑ball is
\[
B_r(G,v)=(\,G[\{y\in V(G): d(v,y)\le r\}],\,v\,).
\]

**Definition 11 (metric \(d_\bullet\)).**  
For \((G_1,v_1),(G_2,v_2)\in\mathbf{G}_\bullet\),
\[
d_\bullet\big((G_1,v_1),(G_2,v_2)\big)=\inf\{2^{-r} : B_r(G_1,v_1)\cong B_r(G_2,v_2)\}.
\]
This is a metric [5].

**Definition 12 (extensions of an r‑ball).**  
For an r‑ball \(F=B_r(G,v)\), define
\[
\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F=\{(G',v')\in \mathbf{G}_\bullet : B_r(G',v')\cong F\}.
\]

**Lemma 13 (basic facts in \((\mathbf{G}_\bullet,d_\bullet)\)).**  
- For each \((G,x)\), \(r\in\mathbb{N}\), and \(0<\varepsilon<1\):
  \[
  U_{2^{-r}+\varepsilon}((G,x))=U_{2^{-r}}((G,x))=\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{B_r(G,x)}.
  \]
- \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F\) is nonempty if \(F\) is an r‑ball in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) that contains a vertex of degree \< \(D\) at distance \(r\) from the root.
- A subset \(S\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) is nowhere dense iff
  \(\forall\) r‑balls \(F\ \exists\) r′‑ball \(F'\) with \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F'}\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F}\setminus S\).
- For all \(D>2\), \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) is not meagre.

### Main results on typical properties

**Theorem 14.**  
*The set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense (i) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) for all \(D>2\); and (ii) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) for all odd \(D>2\).*  
In D‑regular graphs with even \(D\), 1‑way infinite bridges cannot exist; instead we obtain:

**Theorem 15.**  
*The set of graphs without a cut vertex is nowhere dense in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

**Theorem 16.**  
*The set of graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge is meagre (but not nowhere dense) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

We also considered other (a)typical properties:

**Theorem 17.**  
*The set of graphs with edge‑chromatic number \(D\) is nowhere dense in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

### 3. Proof sketches

**Proof of Theorem 4 (sketch).**  
Let the vertices of \(G\) be \(v_1,v_2,\ldots\) and orient each edge \(\{v_i,v_j\}\) from the smaller to the larger index. For each radius \(r\), augment the r‑ball \(B_r(G,v_1)\) to a finite multigraph \(G_r\) by adding a sink vertex \(v_\infty\) and connecting boundary edges to \(v_\infty\). Introduce Boolean variables \(F_{e,1},\dots,F_{e,6}\) encoding which of six nonzero values an edge \(e\) receives, enforce exclusivity \(\bigvee_i F_{e,i}\) and \(\bigwedge_{j\ne i}\neg F_{e,j}\), and write linear parity constraints at each vertex (Kirchhoff’s law). Let \(F_{G_r}\) be the conjunction over vertices of \(G_r\); then every finite subset of the constraint family \(\{F_{G_r}\}_r\cup\{F_{e,i}\}_e\) is satisfiable (by [7]), hence by compactness [4] the whole set is satisfiable, yielding a nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow on \(G\).

**Proof idea for Theorem 14.**  
Given an r‑ball \(F\), construct an r′‑ball \(F'\) such that every extension of \(F'\) contains a bridge. For \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\), attach a leaf to a boundary vertex of degree \<\(D\). For \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) handle regularity via parity gadgets: define \(S(F)=\sum_{v\in L_r}(D-\deg v)\) where \(L_r\) is the boundary; use \(K_{D+1}-e\) gadgets and tree‑like expansions to force parity \(S(F)=1\), then attach a new vertex to create a bridge. Hence the bridgeless set is nowhere dense.

**Proof idea for Theorem 15.**  
In even \(D\)‑regular graphs, use gadgets to force a cut vertex; in odd \(D\) or degree‑bounded spaces, this also follows from the previous construction.

**Proof idea for Theorem 16.**  
Being “there is a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance \(k\)” is nowhere dense; take a union over \(k\in\mathbb{N}\) to get a meagre (but not nowhere‑dense) set.

**Proof idea for Theorem 17.**  
For each \(D\), there exist \(D\)‑regular graphs with \(\chi'(G)=D+1\) (even \(D\): complete graphs or any odd‑order \(D\)‑regular graph; odd \(D\): by Tutte’s theorem). Removing an edge preserves \(\chi'=D+1\) by parity. Embed parity gadgets within r‑balls so that every extension has edge‑chromatic number \(D+1\), hence the set is nowhere dense.

### 4. Future work (the conjectures)

**Question 18.** *Is the fact that a property is nowhere dense or meagre independent of the root?*  
A change of root gives one type of change of metric; however, many metrics on the space of countable graphs are possible.

**Question 19.** *Is there another metric on \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) where typical properties are different?*  
For instance, is there a metric in which **bridgeless graphs are typical**?

We also aim to investigate additional (a)typical properties in the spirit of Theorem 17.
