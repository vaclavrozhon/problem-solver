Since a new vertex z has degree 1, it has no cycle, yet extensions may add edges, complicating this. Essentially, the assertion that the edge remains a bridge in all extensions appears incorrect.

P2\u2019s Lemma 2 is correct: in even D\u2011regular graphs, every bridge is 2\u2011way infinite.

Suppose e separates a finite component C. Then \u2211_{v\u2208C}deg_G(v)=D|C| is even, while in G\u2212e the degree sum in C equals 2|E(C)|+1, which is odd.

Choose a boundary vertex u at distance r with deg_F(u)<D (existence follows since the graph is infinite). Build a finite connected graph H disjoint from F and a new vertex w\u2208V(H) so that: (i) every vertex of H\\\\{w} has degree D within H, (ii) w has degree D\u22121 within H, and (iii) H contains no edges to F. Form F\u2032 by adjoining H to F and adding the single edge e=uw. Inside F\u2032, saturate all vertices of H to degree D (already true after adding e) and add edges within the F\u2011side (using new vertices on the F\u2011side only) to keep all degrees \u2264D and maintain connectivity of the F\u2011side around the root. Leave at least one boundary vertex on the F\u2011side with spare degree to allow an infinite continuation. Then in any extension of F\u2032 with maximum degree \u2264D: no vertex of H can be incident to new edges (all have degree D), so the only possible edges between H and the rest are those already present; thus removing e disconnects H from the rest, so e is a bridge. The H\u2011side is finite; the F\u2011side can be extended to an infinite graph via a boundary vertex with spare degree.

Pick a boundary vertex u at distance r; inside F, deg_F(u)\u2264D, with at least one missing incident edge reserved for connections outside. Construct a finite connected D\u2011regular block H_0 and choose a vertex w_0\u2208V(H_0). Replace at w_0 one internal edge by a short tree\u2011like patch so that within the H\u2011side the vertex w has degree D\u22121 and every other vertex has degree D; denote the result by H and its special vertex by w. Form F\u2032 by adjoining H and adding the single edge e=uw. On the F\u2011side, add edges and finitely many vertices (all within radius R) to saturate u to degree D while keeping the F\u2011side connected, and ensure at least one other boundary vertex retains spare stubs for infinite continuation. On the H\u2011side, every vertex has total degree D in F\u2032 (w gains its final incident edge via e), so no extension can add edges at H; thus e remains the unique edge between H and the rest in any D\u2011regular extension, hence a bridge. Existence of an infinite D\u2011regular extension realizing F\u2032 follows by continuing from a boundary vertex on the F\u2011side using a standard infinite D\u2011regular construction (e.g., attach a rooted copy of the D\u2011regular tree and adjust locally with finite D\u2011regular patches as needed); only the outside of radius R is modified, so B_R equals F\u2032.\\n\\nTheorem 4 (Bridgeless is nowhere dense for cylinder\u2011rich topologies). Let T be a cylinder\u2011rich topology on X.\\n- If X=G_{\u2022,\u2264D} with D\u22652, the set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense in (X,T).\\n- If X=G_{\u2022,=D} with odd D\u22653, the set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense in (X,T).\\nProof. Let U be a nonempty T\u2011open set and x\u2208U. By cylinder\u2011richness, there exists r with Cyl(B_r(x))\u2286U. Apply Lemma 2 (\u2264D) or Lemma 3 (=D odd) to obtain F\u2032 extending B_r(x) such that Cyl(F\u2032)\u2286Cyl(B_r(x)) and every graph in Cyl(F\u2032) has a bridge e that is preserved in all extensions. In particular, Cyl(F\u2032)\u2229(bridgeless)=\u2205, and since the property is enforced by bounded\u2011radius degree saturation, any limit of graphs from Cyl(F\u2032) still contains e as a bridge; hence cl_T(Cyl(F\u2032))\u2286(has a bridge), so Cyl(F\u2032)\u2229cl_T(bridgeless)=\u2205. Thus the interior of cl_T(bridgeless) is empty. Therefore bridgeless is nowhere dense.\\n\\nRemark (even D regular). By Lemma 1, any bridge in =D with even D must be 2\u2011way infinite. The above one\u2011sided bubble forcing cannot be used there (it would force a 1\u2011way bridge and hence yields an empty cylinder). Typicality for \u201cbridgeless\u201d in =D even reduces to understanding the size (Baire\u2011category) of the set of graphs with a 2\u2011way infinite bridge; this remains to be settled here.\"},\"output_update\":null}",
