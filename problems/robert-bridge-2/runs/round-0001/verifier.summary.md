Corrected the core forcing step: a pendant leaf does not force a bridge; instead use a finite D‑saturated “bubble” attached by a single edge, which remains a bridge in every extension. With this, we can prove that in any cylinder‑rich topology (including many natural local metrics), bridgeless graphs are nowhere dense in G_{•,≤D} and in G_{•,=D} for odd D. We flagged that P2’s monotonicity under refinement is false and that claims about even D‑regular bridgeless typicality depend on an unproved meagreness of 2‑way bridges. Nonlocal “bridge‑profile” metrics make “has a bridge” open and thus cannot make bridgeless typical. A proposed end‑sensitive topology remains speculative pending Baire/Polish and density proofs.
