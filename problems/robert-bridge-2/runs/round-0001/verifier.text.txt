{"feedback_md":"Overall: there are useful directions here, but the core forcing arguments for “nowhere dense” are currently incorrect as written, and one key monotonicity claim is false. I outline a corrected forcing gadget that fixes the main gap for ≤D and =D (odd), and I flag what still needs proof (especially the 2‑way bridge meagreness used for even D). I also separate topological facts from metric details and suggest a clean class of metrics/topologies for which the invariance can be proved now.\n\nMajor issues to fix\n- Pendant‑leaf forcing is not robust. In both P1 and P2, the step “attach a leaf so the edge is a bridge in every extension” is false: an extension may add new edges at the leaf, destroying bridgeness. Remedy: force a single‑edge cut by attaching a finite component all of whose vertices are degree‑saturated (to D in ≤D; to exactly D in =D), so no extension can add edges on that side. This yields a bridge in every extension and persists under limits inside the cylinder.\n- Even‑regular parity. P2’s Lemma 2 is correct: in even D‑regular graphs, every bridge is 2‑way infinite. Any forcing of a 1‑way infinite bridge yields an empty cylinder in the =D, even class.\n- Monotonicity error. P2’s Proposition 8 is false. Nowhere‑denseness is not monotone under refinement (counterexample: discrete vs usual topology on R). Do not rely on this.\n- Reliance on Theorem 16. Several conclusions (e.g., “bridgeless is comeagre for even D”) assume that “2‑way bridges” form a meagre set. This remains unproved here; the cycle‑closing construction needs full details under degree constraints.\n\nWhat we can prove now (cleanly)\n- For any topology whose open neighborhoods contain local cylinders around each point (I call these cylinder‑rich; this includes the usual metric, any equivalent ultrametric, and many local weighted/edit‑type metrics), the set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense in G_{•,≤D} for D≥2 and in G_{•,=D} for odd D. The key is the saturated finite “bubble” attached by a single edge that remains a bridge in every extension; I provide a fully detailed proof in proofs.md.\n\nOn nonlocal metrics\n- P1’s “bridge‑profile” metric makes “has a bridge” open (indeed, because the added boolean coordinate is constant across r), so it cannot render “bridgeless” typical. Incompleteness alone does not preclude Baire‑ness, but regardless it fails the goal. \n- P2’s end‑sensitive topology is a plausible finer, nonlocal candidate, but Baire/Polish status and the density arguments needed to make “no 1‑way infinite bridge” comeagre are still open.\n\nNext steps\n- Replace all leaf‑forcing with the saturated‑bubble gadget; extend proofs accordingly (≤D and =D odd). \n- Provide a complete proof (or counterexample) that “2‑way infinite bridges” form a meagre set in both ≤D and =D; this settles even‑regular typicality. \n- Formalize the cylinder‑rich class (metrics whose balls around x contain some d_•‑cylinder around x) and catalog natural examples. \n- If pursuing end‑sensitive topologies, prove metrizability and Baire property first; then attack density of multi‑edge exits from finite cuts.\n","summary_md":"Corrected the core forcing step: a pendant leaf does not force a bridge; instead use a finite D‑saturated “bubble” attached by a single edge, which remains a bridge in every extension.

Correct forcing uses a finite D‑saturated bubble on one side: build a finite connected subgraph H whose vertices all have degree D (in \\le D) or exactly D (in =D), except a designated vertex w with degree D−1 inside H; connect w to a boundary vertex u in the core by a single edge e=uw. Saturate all vertices of H (including w after adding e) to degree D within the prescribed ball, and do not add any other edges between H and the core. Then in every extension respecting the degree bound, no new edges can be added at H, so e remains the unique edge across the cut and is a bridge. The H side is finite; the other side can be extended to infinity via other boundary vertices.\n- Cylinder‑rich topologies: We call a topology cylinder‑rich if for every open neighborhood U of x there exists r with the cylinder {y: B_r(y)≅B_r(x)} contained in U. This covers the local metric and many natural local metrics (weighted multi‑radius edit distances, etc.). In any cylinder‑rich topology, the above gadget yields a cylinder on which every graph has a bridge, so bridgeless sets are nowhere dense in G_{•,≤D} and in G_{•,=D} for odd D.\n- Even D‑regular parity: In D‑regular graphs with even D, every bridge is 2‑way infinite; 1‑way infinite bridges are impossible by degree‑sum parity on a finite component.\n- Nonlocal attempts: Adding a global boolean “has a bridge” coordinate makes that property open and cannot render “bridgeless” typical. An end‑sensitive topology may alter typicality but needs proof of metrizability/Baire property and density arguments to rule out 1‑edge cuts.\n\nOpen tasks\n- Formalize the saturated‑bubble construction in regular (=D) odd case, including existence of infinite D‑regular extensions realizing the refined ball.\n- Prove (or refute) that “has a 2‑way infinite bridge” is meagre in ≤D and =D; this would imply comeagre bridgeless for even D.\n- Specify and study a natural nonlocal, Baire topology (e.g., end‑profile inverse limit) where bridgeless might be typical; verify all topological properties first."},"proofs_update":{"action":"append","content":"Definitions\n\n- Let X be either G_{•,≤D} (all connected rooted graphs with max degree ≤D) or G_{•,=D} (all connected rooted D‑regular rooted graphs), D≥2. For a rooted graph (G,ρ), denote by B_r(G,ρ) its rooted r‑ball and by Cyl(F) the set of rooted graphs whose r‑ball equals F.\n- A topology T on X is cylinder‑rich if for every open neighborhood U∈T and every x∈U there exists r such that Cyl(B_r(x))⊆U.\n\nLemma 1 (Parity in even‑regular graphs). In a countably infinite D‑regular graph with even D, every bridge is 2‑way infinite (after deleting a bridge, both components are infinite).\nProof. Suppose e separates a finite component C. Then ∑_{v∈C}deg_G(v)=D|C| is even, while in G−e the degree sum in C equals 2|E(C)|+1, which is odd. Contradiction.\n\nLemma 2 (Bridge‑forcing cylinder for ≤D). Fix D≥2. Let F be any realized r‑ball in X=G_{•,≤D}. Then there exists R>r and a realized R‑ball F′ with the following property: for every (G,ρ) with B_R(G,ρ)≅F′, the graph G contains a bridge e whose finite side lies entirely inside B_R(G,ρ), and e remains a bridge in every extension of B_R(G,ρ) respecting the degree bound.\nProof. Choose a boundary vertex u at distance r with deg_F(u)<D (existence follows since the graph is infinite). Build a finite connected graph H disjoint from F and a new vertex w∈V(H) so that: (i) every vertex of H\\{w} has degree D within H, (ii) w has degree D−1 within H, and (iii) H contains no edges to F. Form F′ by adjoining H to F and adding the single edge e=uw. Inside F′, saturate all vertices of H to degree D (already true after adding e) and add edges within the F‑side (using new vertices on the F‑side only) to keep all degrees ≤D and maintain connectivity of the F‑side around the root. Leave at least one boundary vertex on the F‑side with spare degree to allow an infinite continuation. Then in any extension of F′ with maximum degree ≤D: no vertex of H can be incident to new edges (all have degree D), so the only possible edges between H and the rest are those already present; thus removing e disconnects H from the rest, so e is a bridge. The H‑side is finite; the F‑side can be extended to an infinite graph via a boundary vertex with spare degree. Hence Cyl(F′) is nonempty and every member has a (1‑way infinite) bridge.\n\nLemma 3 (Bridge‑forcing cylinder for =D, odd D). Fix odd D≥3. Let F be any realized r‑ball in X=G_{•,=D}. Then there exists R>r and a realized R‑ball F′ such that every (G,ρ) with B_R(G,ρ)≅F′ contains a bridge e, and e remains a bridge in all D‑regular extensions of F′.\nProof. Pick a boundary vertex u at distance r; inside F, deg_F(u)≤D, with at least one missing incident edge reserved for connections outside. Construct a finite connected D‑regular block H_0 and choose a vertex w_0∈V(H_0). Replace at w_0 one internal edge by a short tree‑like patch so that within the H‑side the vertex w has degree D−1 and every other vertex has degree D; denote the result by H and its special vertex by w. Form F′ by adjoining H and adding the single edge e=uw. On the F‑side, add edges and finitely many vertices (all within radius R) to saturate u to degree D while keeping the F‑side connected, and ensure at least one other boundary vertex retains spare stubs for infinite continuation. On the H‑side, every vertex has total degree D in F′ (w gains its final incident edge via e), so no extension can add edges at H; thus e remains the unique edge between H and the rest in any D‑regular extension, hence a bridge. Existence of an infinite D‑regular extension realizing F′ follows by continuing from a boundary vertex on the F‑side using a standard infinite D‑regular construction (e.g., attach a rooted copy of the D‑regular tree and adjust locally with finite D‑regular patches as needed); only the outside of radius R is modified, so B_R equals F′.\n\nTheorem 4 (Bridgeless is nowhere dense for cylinder‑rich topologies). Let T be a cylinder‑rich topology on X.\n- If X=G_{•,≤D} with D≥2, the set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense in (X,T).\n- If X=G_{•,=D} with odd D≥3, the set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense in (X,T).\nProof. Let U be a nonempty T‑open set and x∈U. By cylinder‑richness, there exists r with Cyl(B_r(x))⊆U. Apply Lemma 2 (≤D) or Lemma 3 (=D odd) to obtain F′ extending B_r(x) such that Cyl(F′)⊆Cyl(B_r(x)) and every graph in Cyl(F′) has a bridge e that is preserved in all extensions. In particular, Cyl(F′)∩(bridgeless)=∅, and since the property is enforced by bounded‑radius degree saturation, any limit of graphs from Cyl(F′) still contains e as a bridge; hence cl_T(Cyl(F′))⊆(has a bridge), so Cyl(F′)∩cl_T(bridgeless)=∅. Thus the interior of cl_T(bridgeless) is empty. Therefore bridgeless is nowhere dense.\n\nRemark (even D regular). By Lemma 1, any bridge in =D with even D must be 2‑way infinite. The above one‑sided bubble forcing cannot be used there (it would force a 1‑way bridge and hence yields an empty cylinder). Typicality for “bridgeless” in =D even reduces to understanding the size (Baire‑category) of the set of graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge; this remains to be settled here."},"output_update":null}
