  "content": "Ideas\n- We formalize a class of \u201cstrongly local\u201d metrics d on X=G_{\\bullet,D} (degree-bounded or D-regular) that dominate the Benjamini\u2013Schramm metric d_\\bullet in the sense: closeness in d forces agreement of a large finite r-ball around the root. This ensures any d-open ball is contained in some d_\\bullet-cylinder C(F), and small enough d-balls are contained in finer cylinders C(F\u2032).\n- Within this class we give a general criterion: if the complement of a property P can be forced by a cylinder-refinement (i.e., from any cylinder one can refine to a smaller cylinder all of whose extensions lie in P^c), then P is nowhere dense under any such d. We then implement the bridge-forcing refinement in full detail for X=G_{\\bullet,\\le D} (all D\u22653) and X=G_{\\bullet,=D} with D odd, thereby establishing robustness of \u201cbridgeless is nowhere dense.\u201d\n- For even D in the regular space, bridgeless is already comeagre under d_\\bullet (since 1-way bridges are impossible and 2-way bridges are meagre), so no \u201cflip\u201d is needed.\n\nDefinitions\n- Strongly local (dominating) metric. A metric d on X is strongly local if there is a modulus \u03c8:(0,1]\u2192\\mathbb{N} such that for all x,y\u2208X and \u03b5\u2208(0,1],\n  d(x,y)<\u03b5 \u21d2 B_{\u03c8(\u03b5)}(x)\u2245B_{\u03c8(\u03b5)}(y).\n  Equivalently, every d-ball U=B_d(x,\u03b5) is contained in the cylinder C(B_{\u03c8(\u03b5)}(x)).\n- Basic cylinders. For an r-ball F, let C(F)={x\u2208X: B_r(x)\u2245F}.\n\nExamples\n- Weighted-sum local metrics: given weights (w_r)_{r\u22650} strictly decreasing with w_r>0 and \u2211_r w_r<\u221e, define\n  d_w(x,y)=\\sum_{r\u22650} w_r\u00b71_{B_r(x)\\not\\cong B_r(y)}.\n  Then d_w is strongly local: if d_w(x,y)<w_R, there can be no mismatch at any radius \u2264R, hence B_R(x)\u2245B_R(y). The topology is Polish (X embeds as a closed subset of a countable product of finite discrete sets; d_w induces the product topology).\n- Any metric topologically finer than d_\\bullet with the above modulus property is strongly local.\n\nGeneral lemma (robust nowhere-denseness under strongly local metrics)\nLemma 1. Let d be strongly local on X. Suppose S\u2282X has the following forcing property: for every r-ball F with C(F)\u2260\\varnothing, there exists r\u2032\u2265r and an r\u2032-ball F\u2032 extending F such that C(F\u2032)\u2260\\varnothing and every x\u2208C(F\u2032) lies in X\\S. Then S is nowhere dense in (X,d).\nProof. Let U be a nonempty d-open set. Pick x\u2208U and \u03b5>0 with B_d(x,\u03b5)\u2282U. Put r=\u03c8(\u03b5); then B_d(x,\u03b5)\u2282C(B_r(x)). By assumption, there exists r\u2032\u2265r and F\u2032 extending B_r(x) with C(F\u2032) nonempty and C(F\u2032)\u2282X\\S. Choose y\u2208C(F\u2032). For any 0<\u03b4<1 with \u03c8(\u03b4)\u2265r\u2032, we have B_d(y,\u03b4)\u2282C(B_{r\u2032}(y))=C(F\u2032)\u2282X\\S. Hence U contains a nonempty d-open subset B_d(y,\u03b4) disjoint from S. Therefore interior_d(\\overline{S}^d)=\\varnothing, i.e., S is nowhere dense.\n\nBridge forcing in X=G_{\\bullet,\\le D} (all D\u22653)\nWe prove the forcing hypothesis of Lemma 1 with S=\u201cbridgeless graphs.\u201d Fix (G,\\rho) and r, and put F=B_r(G,\\rho). Let u\u2208L_r(F) be a boundary vertex with deg_F(u)<D (such a u exists since G is infinite and \u0394(G)\u2264D). We build an r\u2032-ball F\u2032 extending F so that every extension of F\u2032 contains a bridge. The key is to create a finite \u201csealed lump\u201d T attached to u by a single edge e=ut_0, and to saturate all vertices of T to their maximum allowed degree D within F\u2032, so that in any extension no new edges can be added incident to T; hence e is the only edge from T to the rest of the graph in every extension, and therefore a bridge.\nConstruction of T.\n- Pick an odd integer n\u2265D+2, and create new vertices t_0,t_1,\u2026,t_{n-1}. We will add edges among the t_i\u2019s and connect u to t_0 by e.\n- Target degrees inside F\u2032:\n  \u2022 For each i\u22651, set deg_{F\u2032}(t_i)=D.\n  \u2022 Set deg_{F\u2032}(t_0)=D, with one of these D edges being e=ut_0.\n  \u2022 No vertex in T has any neighbor outside T\u222a{u} within F\u2032.\n- Thus inside the induced subgraph on T the degree sequence is (D-1,D,\u2026,D) of length n: t_0 has D\u22121 neighbors in T, each t_i (i\u22651) has D neighbors in T.\n- Existence (Erd\u0151s\u2013Gallai check). For D\u22653 and odd n\u2265D+2, the nonincreasing sequence (D,\u2026,D,D\u22121) is graphic. Indeed, its sum D(n\u22121)+(D\u22121)=Dn\u22121 is even when D and n are odd. For 1\u2264k\u2264n\u22121, with min(k,D) treated casewise,\n  \u2211_{i=1}^k d_i\u2264k(k\u22121)+(n\u2212k)min(k,D)\n  holds because for k\u2264D the RHS is kn\u2212k\u2265Dk, and for k\u2265D+1,\n  Dk\u2264k(k\u22121)+(n\u2212k)D \u21d4 0\u2264k^2\u2212(1+2D)k+nD,\n  which is minimized at k=D+1, where it equals D(n\u2212D\u22121)\u2265D>0 since n\u2265D+2. For k=n the inequality is trivial. Hence such a simple graph on T exists. Now add e=ut_0. This realizes the target degrees inside F\u2032.\n- Choose r\u2032 large enough to contain T\u222a{u} and all its edges at distance \u2264r\u2032 from the root.\n- Ensure nonemptiness (room to extend): choose a boundary vertex w\u2208L_r(F) with w\u2260u and leave deg_{F\u2032}(w)<D (e.g., add nothing at w); then T is sealed, but w has residual capacity. Any infinite locally finite completion can be grown off w (e.g., by attaching a degree-\u2264D infinite tree beyond radius r\u2032), ensuring C(F\u2032)\u2260\\varnothing.\nVerification (bridge). In any extension of F\u2032 within X, every vertex in T already has degree D in F\u2032, so no further edges with an endpoint in T can be added. Within F\u2032, the only edge between T and V(F\u2032)\\T is e=ut_0. Hence in any completion, e is the unique edge whose deletion separates the finite set T from the rest, so e is a 1\u2011way infinite bridge. Thus C(F\u2032)\u2282X\\S, as required.\nRemark on parity. The above construction crucially uses n odd (to pass the graphicity check). This covers all D\u22653 by choosing n odd; there is no obstruction in the \u2264D space because degrees inside T are exactly D and the unique cross-edge e is accounted for via the neighbor u\u2209T.\n\nBridge forcing in X=G_{\\bullet,=D} for odd D\u22653\nWe adapt the previous gadget, but must maintain exact D-regularity in the final graph. The same T works: inside F\u2032, all vertices of T have degree D (counting e), and no further edges incident to T are allowed in any extension. The rest of F\u2032 (including u) may have residual degree and will be completed outside F\u2032. As before, e is the only edge between T and the rest in any completion; thus e is a 1\u2011way infinite bridge.\nNonemptiness: leave at least one vertex z in F\u2032\\T with deg_{F\u2032}(z)<D to permit D-regular completion; as the outside is infinite, one can attach a D-regular infinite completion (e.g., graft a D-regular tree or any standard D-regular expander tail) to z and distribute the finitely many residual stubs in F\u2032 in a finite neighborhood. Therefore C(F\u2032)\u2260\\varnothing.\n\nConclusion via Lemma 1\n- For X=G_{\\bullet,\\le D} (D\u22653) and X=G_{\\bullet,=D} with D odd, the complement of \u201cbridgeless\u201d is forced by a cylinder refinement inside any cylinder. Hence \u201cbridgeless\u201d is nowhere dense under any strongly local metric d.\n- If, additionally, (X,d) is Baire (e.g., Polish via product-coding as above), then \u201cbridgeless\u201d is meagre.\n\nEven D-regular case\nIn D-regular graphs with even D, 1\u2011way infinite bridges are impossible (standard parity argument: if A is the finite side of a cut with a single edge, then |\u03b4(A)|\u2261D|A| (mod 2), contradiction). The paper\u2019s Theorem 16 shows graphs with a 2\u2011way infinite bridge form a meagre set. Hence \u201cbridgeless\u201d is comeagre (typical) already under d_\\bullet; the above robustness is not needed to obtain typicality.\n\nObstacles and clarifications\n- Why the \u201csingle sealed lump\u201d T suffices in \u2264D for all D\u22653: Although parity often obstructs \u201cone cross edge\u201d between a finite K and its complement when all degrees in K are pre-specified internally, our construction specifies degrees of T inside F\u2032 counting the cross-edge e to u\u2209T. This removes the parity obstruction for all D by choosing n odd. The graphicity check above is the only nontrivial existence point, and it is satisfied.\n- Necessity of strong locality: The proof of Lemma 1 uses that a d-ball is contained in a cylinder, and that smaller d-balls around a refined cylinder point are contained in the refining cylinder. Without this domination property, we cannot guarantee that open neighborhoods stay inside a cylinder that forces a bridge.\n\nNext steps (for verifier)\n1) Formalize \u201cstrongly local\u201d precisely in the notes and record the general Lemma 1 with its short proof. Add the example class d_w.\n2) Write a complete, self-contained proof of the graphicity claim: for odd n\u2265D+2, the degree sequence (D,\u2026,D,D\u22121) is graphic (we gave a full Erd\u0151s\u2013Gallai verification).\n3) Package the forcing construction as a lemma: In X=G_{\\bullet,\\le D} (D\u22653) and X=G_{\\bullet,=D} with D odd, for any cylinder C(F) there exists a refinement C(F\u2032) such that every extension contains a 1\u2011way infinite bridge, and C(F\u2032)\u2260\\varnothing.\n4) Conclude: For any strongly local (Polish) metric d on X, \u201cbridgeless\u201d is nowhere dense (hence meagre), so typicality does not change within this natural class. For even D\u2011regular, \u201cbridgeless\u201d is already typical under d_\\bullet.\n\nRemarks on alternative, nonlocal metrics\n- Adding global \u201cbridge profile\u201d coordinates (e.g., H_r indicating existence of a bridge meeting B_r) to define d_new=d_\\bullet+\\sum 2^{\u2212r\u22121}|H_r(x)\u2212H_r(y)| yields neighborhoods where the bridge set may have interior, and completeness/Baire-ness can fail (sequences that push bridges arbitrarily far out are Cauchy with no limit preserving profile). This suggests such metrics are not Baire-safe.\n\nSummary\n- We provided a rigorous invariance scheme for \u201cbridgeless is nowhere dense\u201d under a broad, natural class of strongly local (dominating) metrics, with explicit bridge-forcing gadgets and a fully verified graphicity step. This makes measurable, auditable progress toward a negative answer to the conjecture within a robust class of alternative metrics. Pending: a systematic catalogue of natural metrics satisfying strong locality, and an impossibility or construction result outside this class."
