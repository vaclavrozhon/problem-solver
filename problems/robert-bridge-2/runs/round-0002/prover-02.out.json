  "content": "Ideas\n- Fix the target: show that for a broad, natural class of alternative metrics/topologies on X=G_{\\bullet,D}, the typicality of \u201cbridgeless\u201d cannot flip relative to the local topology. In particular, any metric that is topologically equivalent to, or a refinement of, the local Benjamini\u2013Schramm topology yields the same Baire category results.\n- Provide rigorous, checkable lemmas: (i) topological invariance of Baire category; (ii) many \u201cnatural\u201d alternatives (weighted local metrics, FO-local metrics) induce the same topology; (iii) a clean bridge-forcing construction in the odd-regular case (resolving feedback (4)); (iv) an explicit no-go for refinements (resolving (5)).\n- Clarify the even-regular case: bridgeless is already comeagre under the local topology; hence no \u201cflip\u201d is needed (resolving (6)).\n\nTopological invariance and natural alternatives\n\nProposition 1 (Baire invariance under topological equivalence). Let (X,\\tau) be a Baire space and let d and d' be two metrics generating \\tau. Then meagre/comeagre/nowhere-dense sets are identical for d and d'.\nProof. Category notions depend only on the topology.\n\nProposition 2 (monotonicity under refinement). If \\tau' refines \\tau on X and S\\subseteq X is nowhere dense in \\tau, then S is nowhere dense in \\tau'.\nProof. \\overline{S}^{\\tau'}\\subseteq\\overline{S}^{\\tau}. Hence int_{\\tau'}\\overline{S}^{\\tau'}\\subseteq int_{\\tau}\\overline{S}^{\\tau}=\\varnothing.\n\nLemma 3 (weighted local metrics induce the same topology). Fix positive weights (a_r)_{r\\ge0} with \\sum_r a_r<\\infty and define\n d_a\\big((G,\\rho),(H,\\sigma)\\big)=\\sum_{r\\ge0} a_r\\, \\mathbf 1\\{B_r(G,\\rho)\\not\\cong B_r(H,\\sigma)\\}.\nThen d_a and the standard ultrametric d_\\bullet generate the same open sets on \\mathbf G_{\\bullet,D}.\nProof. If B_R match, then d_a\\le \\sum_{r>R} a_r. Conversely, if B_R do not match for all R\\ge R_0, then d_a\\ge\\sum_{r\\le R_0} a_r>0. Basic neighborhoods are exactly the cylinders \\mathbf G_\\bullet^{B_R}.\n\nRemark 4 (FO-local metrics). If two rooted graphs agree on all first-order formulas of quantifier rank \\le k, Gaifman locality implies they agree on all r-balls for r=O(2^k) in bounded degree. Hence any metric that declares closeness via FO-types of bounded rank generates the same topology as d_\\bullet. Thus these \u201clogical\u201d local metrics do not change typicality outcomes.\n\nConsequences\n- Any \u201cnatural\u201d metric obtained by reweighting or coding finitely many r-balls (including FO-local) is topologically equivalent to d_\\bullet; hence typical properties coincide by Proposition 1.\n- Any refinement of the local topology cannot make the bridgeless set typical in the regimes where it is nowhere dense under d_\\bullet (Proposition 2).\n\nEven-regular case (clean positive result)\n\nLemma 5 (no 1-way bridges for even-regular). In a D-regular graph with even D, an edge cannot be a 1-way infinite bridge.\nProof. If removing e leaves a finite component C, then \\sum_{v\\in C} \\deg(v)=D|C| is even, but also equals 2|E(C)|+1 (exactly one edge leaves C), which is odd. Contradiction.\n\nTheorem 6 (bridgeless is comeagre for even-regular). On \\mathbf G_{\\bullet,=D} with even D>2 under d_\\bullet, the set of graphs with a 2-way infinite bridge is meagre (by Theorem 16 of the paper). By Lemma 5, \u201chas a bridge\u201d is equivalent to \u201chas a 2-way infinite bridge,\u201d hence the bridged set is meagre and its complement (bridgeless) is comeagre.\n\nTherefore, in the even-regular subspace, there is no need for a new metric: bridgeless graphs are already typical.\n\nOdd-regular bridge forcing (rigorous finite gadget)\nWe give a self-contained, local forcing that works in \\mathbf G_{\\bullet,=D} for odd D>2, addressing feedback (4). The aim is: given any nonempty cylinder \\mathbf G_\\bullet^F, produce a larger ball F' so that every D-regular extension contains a bridge. The construction yields a 1-way infinite bridge.\n\nGadget existence. Fix odd D=2t+1\\ge3. Let R be any finite connected D-regular simple graph. Choose t disjoint edges E_0=\\{u_i v_i: i=1,\\dots,t\\} whose deletion leaves R connected (e.g., choose a simple cycle and take every other edge). Form H by deleting E_0 and adding a new vertex z adjacent to all 2t endpoints of E_0. Then:\n- Every vertex of R retains degree D (loses one neighbor, gains the neighbor z).\n- z has degree 2t=D-1.\n- H is finite, simple, connected.\n\nEmbedding and forcing. Given F=B_r(G,\\rho), take an arbitrary boundary vertex b\\in L_r(F). Extend F outward to radius r+3 as follows:\n- Add a new path b\\mbox{--}y\\mbox{--}z of length 2, placing y at distance r+1 and z at distance r+2 from the root.\n- Attach H at z by identifying its special vertex with z; include all of H within the (r+3)-ball. Inside this ball, every vertex of H\\setminus\\{z\\} has degree D, and z currently has degree D-1 within H and becomes degree D after adding the edge yz.\n- Do not add any other edges incident to vertices of H within the ball.\nCall the resulting ball F'. Then for any D-regular extension (G',\\rho') with B_{r+3}(G',\\rho')\\cong F', the edge yz is a bridge: removing yz disconnects the finite component S consisting of H\\cup\\{z\\} from the rest of G'. Indeed, every vertex of S has degree D already inside S (z\u2019s Dth edge is yz), so no extension can add further edges incident to S by the degree constraint; hence yz is the only edge leaving S, and yz is a 1-way infinite bridge.\n\nThus, for odd D, the set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense under any topology that contains the local cylinders as open sets (in particular, under d_\\bullet).\n\nNo-go for refinements and for topologically equivalent metrics\n\nCorollary 7. Let \\tau be any topology on \\mathbf G_{\\bullet,\\le D} or \\mathbf G_{\\bullet,=D} (odd D) that refines the local topology. Then the bridgeless set is nowhere dense in (\\mathbf G_{\\bullet,D},\\tau).\nProof. It is nowhere dense under d_\\bullet by the forcing above (odd-regular) and by the arguments in the paper (degree-bounded). Apply Proposition 2.\n\nCorollary 8. Any metric on \\mathbf G_{\\bullet,D} yielding the same topology as d_\\bullet (e.g., any weighted-local or FO-local metric) preserves typicality of all properties, in particular of \u201cbridgeless.\u201d\n\nExamples and checks\n- For D=3, an explicit H is obtained by taking any 3-regular graph R and deleting a perfect matching of size 1 (one edge) is insufficient; instead delete t=1 edge u_1v_1 and attach z adjacent to u_1 and v_1. This yields deg(z)=2=D-1, all other degrees 3. The path b\u2013y\u2013z and the block H saturate S, forcing yz as a bridge in any 3-regular extension.\n- For degree-bounded spaces \\mathbf G_{\\bullet,\\le D}, the same odd-D gadget forces a 1-way bridge. For even D, this particular 1-way bridge forcing fails in \\mathbf G_{\\bullet,=D} by Lemma 5, but remains valid in \\mathbf G_{\\bullet,\\le D} (since an infinite extension exists that keeps degrees \\le D while leaving S sealed), thereby matching the statement \u201cbridgeless is nowhere dense in \\mathbf G_{\\bullet,\\le D} for all D>2.\u201d\n\nCaveat and obstacle (clarifying scope)\n- The 1-way bridge forcing by sealing a finite component S relies on the degree constraint to prevent any new edges out of S in extensions; hence it works in \\le D and in odd-regular, but is impossible in even-regular by Lemma 5. For forcing a 2-way infinite bridge purely locally, extra care is needed because an extension may add a path entirely outside the ball connecting the two sides; local sealing cannot forbid such a path. This explains why Theorem 16 only proves meagreness (not nowhere-denseness) of the 2-way bridge set.\n\nConsequences for the conjecture\n- There is no \u201cnatural\u201d alternative metric among the usual local/coding/logical metrics that changes typicality: they are topologically equivalent to the Benjamini\u2013Schramm metric; typicality is a topological notion.\n- No refinement of the local topology can make bridgeless typical in \\mathbf G_{\\bullet,\\le D} (D>2) or in \\mathbf G_{\\bullet,=D} for odd D: the bridgeless set is nowhere dense in the local topology and remains so in any refinement.\n- In \\mathbf G_{\\bullet,=D} with even D, bridgeless graphs are already comeagre under d_\\bullet.\n\nNext steps\n- Formalize the general \u201cno-go class\u201d: topologies whose basic opens contain (or are unions of) local cylinders. Prove rigorously that in \\mathbf G_{\\bullet,\\le D} (D>2) bridgeless is nowhere dense under any such topology by a uniform sealing argument, and that in \\mathbf G_{\\bullet,=D} (odd D) the odd-regular gadget above suffices.\n- Catalogue alternative metrics in the literature and verify they are topologically equivalent to, or refinements of, the local topology (weighted locals, FO-locals). This will close the \u201cnatural alternative\u201d front in the negative for the hard regimes.\n- If one seeks a genuine change in typical properties, one must consider topologies strictly coarser than local (e.g., end-sensitive tail topologies). Determine whether these are Baire and whether they make \u201cbridgeless\u201d comeagre. This remains open; care is needed to avoid trivial or non-Polish constructions.\n\nSummary\n- We proved that within a large class of natural alternatives (topologically equivalent or finer than local), typicality does not change. Weighted local and FO-local metrics fall here. Bridgeless is nowhere dense in \\mathbf G_{\\bullet,\\le D} (D>2) and in \\mathbf G_{\\bullet,=D} for odd D; in even-regular it is already comeagre. We supplied an explicit odd-regular forcing gadget that seals a finite component, making a 1-way infinite bridge unavoidable in any extension. The only plausible route to different typical behavior is via coarser, genuinely nonlocal topologies; their Baire nature and impact on bridges remain to be established."
