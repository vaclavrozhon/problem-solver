Thus these \u201clogical\u201d local metrics do not change typicality outcomes.\\n\\nConsequences\\n- Any \u201cnatural\u201d metric obtained by reweighting or coding finitely many r-balls (including FO-local) is topologically equivalent to d_\\\\bullet; hence typical properties coincide by Proposition 1.\\n- Any refinement of the local topology cannot make the bridgeless set typical in the regimes where it is nowhere dense under d_\\\\bullet (Proposition 2).\\n\\nEven-regular case (clean positive result)\\n\\nLemma 5 (no 1-way bridges for even-regular). In a D-regular graph with even D, an edge cannot be a 1-way infinite bridge.\\nProof. If removing e leaves a finite component C, then \\\\sum_{v\\\\in C} \\\\deg(v)=D|C| is even, but also equals 2|E(C)|+1 (exactly one edge leaves C), which is odd. Contradiction.\\n\\nTheorem 6 (bridgeless is comeagre for even-regular). On \\\\mathbf G_{\\\\bullet,=D} with even D>2 under d_\\\\bullet, the set of graphs with a 2-way infinite bridge is meagre (by Theorem 16 of the paper). By Lemma 5, \u201chas a bridge\u201d is equivalent to \u201chas a 2-way infinite bridge,\u201d hence the bridged set is meagre and its complement (bridgeless) is comeagre.\\n\\nTherefore, in the even-regular subspace, there is no need for a new metric: bridgeless graphs are already typical.\\n\\nOdd-regular bridge forcing (rigorous finite gadget)\\nWe give a self-contained, local forcing that works in \\\\mathbf G_{\\\\bullet,=D} for odd D>2, addressing feedback (4). The aim is: given any nonempty cylinder \\\\mathbf G_\\\\bullet^F, produce a larger ball F' so that every D-regular extension contains a bridge. The construction yields a 1-way infinite bridge.\\n\\nGadget existence. Fix odd D=2t+1\\\\ge3. Let R be any finite connected D-regular simple graph. Choose t disjoint edges E_0=\\\\{u_i v_i: i=1,\\\\dots,t\\\\} whose deletion leaves R connected (e.g., choose a simple cycle and take every other edge). Form H by deleting E_0 and adding a new vertex z adjacent to all 2t endpoints of E_0. Then:\\n- Every vertex of R retains degree D (loses one neighbor, gains the neighbor z).\\n- z has degree 2t=D-1.\\n- H is finite, simple, connected.\\n\\nEmbedding and forcing. Given F=B_r(G,\\\\rho), take an arbitrary boundary vertex b\\\\in L_r(F). Extend F outward to radius r+3 as follows:\\n- Add a new path b\\\\mbox{--}y\\\\mbox{--}z of length 2, placing y at distance r+1 and z at distance r+2 from the root.\\n- Attach H at z by identifying its special vertex with z; include all of H within the (r+3)-ball. Inside this ball, every vertex of H\\\\setminus\\\\{z\\\\} has degree D, and z currently has degree D-1 within H and becomes degree D after adding the edge yz.\\n- Do not add any other edges incident to vertices of H within the ball.\\nCall the resulting ball F'. Then for any D-regular extension (G',\\\\rho') with B_{r+3}(G',\\\\rho')\\\\cong F', the edge yz is a bridge: removing yz disconnects the finite component S consisting of H\\\\cup\\\\{z\\\\} from the rest of G'. Indeed, every vertex of S has degree D already inside S (z\u2019s Dth edge is yz), so no extension can add further edges incident to S by the degree constraint; hence yz is the only edge leaving S, and yz is a 1-way infinite bridge.\\n\\nThus, for odd D, the set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense under any topology that contains the local cylinders as open sets (in particular, under d_\\\\bullet).\\n\\nNo-go for refinements and for topologically equivalent metrics\\n\\nCorollary 7. Let \\\\tau be any topology on \\\\mathbf G_{\\\\bullet,\\\\le D} or \\\\mathbf G_{\\\\bullet,=D} (odd D) that refines the local topology. Then the bridgeless set is nowhere dense in (\\\\mathbf G_{\\\\bullet,D},\\\\tau).\\nProof. It is nowhere dense under d_\\\\bullet by the forcing above (odd-regular) and by the arguments in the paper (degree-bounded). Apply Proposition 2.\\n\\nCorollary 8. Any metric on \\\\mathbf G_{\\\\bullet,D} yielding the same topology as d_\\\\bullet (e.g., any weighted-local or FO-local metric) preserves typicality of all properties, in particular of \u201cbridgeless.\u201d\\n\\nExamples and checks\\n- For D=3, an explicit H is obtained by taking any 3-regular graph R and deleting a perfect matching of size 1 (one edge) is insufficient; instead delete t=1 edge u_1v_1 and attach z adjacent to u_1 and v_1. This yields deg(z)=2=D-1, all other degrees 3. The path b\u2013y\u2013z and the block H saturate S, forcing yz as a bridge in any 3-regular extension.\\n- For degree-bounded spaces \\\\mathbf G_{\\\\bullet,\\\\le D}, the same odd-D gadget forces a 1-way bridge. For even D, this particular 1-way bridge forcing fails in \\\\mathbf G_{\\\\bullet,=D} by Lemma 5, but remains valid in \\\\mathbf G_{\\\\bullet,\\\\le D} (since an infinite extension exists that keeps degrees \\\\le D while leaving S sealed), thereby matching the statement \u201cbridgeless is nowhere dense in \\\\mathbf G_{\\\\bullet,\\\\le D} for all D>2.\u201d\\n\\nCaveat and obstacle (clarifying scope)\\n- The 1-way bridge forcing by sealing a finite component S relies on the degree constraint to prevent any new edges out of S in extensions; hence it works in \\\\le D and in odd-regular, but is impossible in even-regular by Lemma 5. For forcing a 2-way infinite bridge purely locally, extra care is needed because an extension may add a path entirely outside the ball connecting the two sides; local sealing cannot forbid such a path. This explains why Theorem 16 only proves meagreness (not nowhere-denseness) of the 2-way bridge set.\\n\\nConsequences for the conjecture\\n- There is no \u201cnatural\u201d alternative metric among the usual local/coding/logical metrics that changes typicality: they are topologically equivalent to the Benjamini\u2013Schramm metric; typicality is a topological notion.\\n- No refinement of the local topology can make bridgeless typical in \\\\mathbf G_{\\\\bullet,\\\\le D} (D>2) or in \\\\mathbf G_{\\\\bullet,=D} for odd D: the bridgeless set is nowhere dense in the local topology and remains so in any refinement.\\n- In \\\\mathbf G_{\\\\bullet,=D} with even D, bridgeless graphs are already comeagre under d_\\\\bullet.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Formalize the general \u201cno-go class\u201d: topologies whose basic opens contain (or are unions of) local cylinders. Prove rigorously that in \\\\mathbf G_{\\\\bullet,\\\\le D} (D>2) bridgeless is nowhere dense under any such topology by a uniform sealing argument, and that in \\\\mathbf G_{\\\\bullet,=D} (odd D) the odd-regular gadget above suffices.\\n- Catalogue alternative metrics in the literature and verify they are topologically equivalent to, or refinements of, the local topology (weighted locals, FO-locals). This will close the \u201cnatural alternative\u201d front in the negative for the hard regimes.\\n- If one seeks a genuine change in typical properties, one must consider topologies strictly coarser than local (e.g., end-sensitive tail topologies). Determine whether these are Baire and whether they make \u201cbridgeless\u201d comeagre. This remains open; care is needed to avoid trivial or non-Polish constructions.\\n\\nSummary\\n- We proved that within a large class of natural alternatives (topologically equivalent or finer than local), typicality does not change. Weighted local and FO-local metrics fall here. Bridgeless is nowhere dense in \\\\mathbf G_{\\\\bullet,\\\\le D} (D>2) and in \\\\mathbf G_{\\\\bullet,=D} for odd D; in even-regular it is already comeagre. We supplied an explicit odd-regular forcing gadget that seals a finite component, making a 1-way infinite bridge unavoidable in any extension. The only plausible route to different typical behavior is via coarser, genuinely nonlocal topologies; their Baire nature and impact on bridges remain to be established.\"}",
