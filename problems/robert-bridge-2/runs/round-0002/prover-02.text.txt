Ideas
- Fix the target: show that for a broad, natural class of alternative metrics/topologies on X=G_{\bullet,D}, the typicality of “bridgeless” cannot flip relative to the local topology. In particular, any metric that is topologically equivalent to, or a refinement of, the local Benjamini–Schramm topology yields the same Baire category results.
- Provide rigorous, checkable lemmas: (i) topological invariance of Baire category; (ii) many “natural” alternatives (weighted local metrics, FO-local metrics) induce the same topology; (iii) a clean bridge-forcing construction in the odd-regular case (resolving feedback (4)); (iv) an explicit no-go for refinements (resolving (5)).
- Clarify the even-regular case: bridgeless is already comeagre under the local topology; hence no “flip” is needed (resolving (6)).

Topological invariance and natural alternatives

Proposition 1 (Baire invariance under topological equivalence). Let (X,\tau) be a Baire space and let d and d' be two metrics generating \tau. Then meagre/comeagre/nowhere-dense sets are identical for d and d'.
Proof. Category notions depend only on the topology.

Proposition 2 (monotonicity under refinement). If \tau' refines \tau on X and S\subseteq X is nowhere dense in \tau, then S is nowhere dense in \tau'.
Proof. \overline{S}^{\tau'}\subseteq\overline{S}^{\tau}. Hence int_{\tau'}\overline{S}^{\tau'}\subseteq int_{\tau}\overline{S}^{\tau}=\varnothing.

Lemma 3 (weighted local metrics induce the same topology). Fix positive weights (a_r)_{r\ge0} with \sum_r a_r<\infty and define
 d_a\big((G,\rho),(H,\sigma)\big)=\sum_{r\ge0} a_r\, \mathbf 1\{B_r(G,\rho)\not\cong B_r(H,\sigma)\}.
Then d_a and the standard ultrametric d_\bullet generate the same open sets on \mathbf G_{\bullet,D}.
Proof. If B_R match, then d_a\le \sum_{r>R} a_r. Conversely, if B_R do not match for all R\ge R_0, then d_a\ge\sum_{r\le R_0} a_r>0. Basic neighborhoods are exactly the cylinders \mathbf G_\bullet^{B_R}.

Remark 4 (FO-local metrics). If two rooted graphs agree on all first-order formulas of quantifier rank \le k, Gaifman locality implies they agree on all r-balls for r=O(2^k) in bounded degree. Hence any metric that declares closeness via FO-types of bounded rank generates the same topology as d_\bullet. Thus these “logical” local metrics do not change typicality outcomes.

Consequences
- Any “natural” metric obtained by reweighting or coding finitely many r-balls (including FO-local) is topologically equivalent to d_\bullet; hence typical properties coincide by Proposition 1.
- Any refinement of the local topology cannot make the bridgeless set typical in the regimes where it is nowhere dense under d_\bullet (Proposition 2).

Even-regular case (clean positive result)

Lemma 5 (no 1-way bridges for even-regular). In a D-regular graph with even D, an edge cannot be a 1-way infinite bridge.
Proof. If removing e leaves a finite component C, then \sum_{v\in C} \deg(v)=D|C| is even, but also equals 2|E(C)|+1 (exactly one edge leaves C), which is odd. Contradiction.

Theorem 6 (bridgeless is comeagre for even-regular). On \mathbf G_{\bullet,=D} with even D>2 under d_\bullet, the set of graphs with a 2-way infinite bridge is meagre (by Theorem 16 of the paper). By Lemma 5, “has a bridge” is equivalent to “has a 2-way infinite bridge,” hence the bridged set is meagre and its complement (bridgeless) is comeagre.

Therefore, in the even-regular subspace, there is no need for a new metric: bridgeless graphs are already typical.

Odd-regular bridge forcing (rigorous finite gadget)
We give a self-contained, local forcing that works in \mathbf G_{\bullet,=D} for odd D>2, addressing feedback (4). The aim is: given any nonempty cylinder \mathbf G_\bullet^F, produce a larger ball F' so that every D-regular extension contains a bridge. The construction yields a 1-way infinite bridge.

Gadget existence. Fix odd D=2t+1\ge3. Let R be any finite connected D-regular simple graph. Choose t disjoint edges E_0=\{u_i v_i: i=1,\dots,t\} whose deletion leaves R connected (e.g., choose a simple cycle and take every other edge). Form H by deleting E_0 and adding a new vertex z adjacent to all 2t endpoints of E_0. Then:
- Every vertex of R retains degree D (loses one neighbor, gains the neighbor z).
- z has degree 2t=D-1.
- H is finite, simple, connected.

Embedding and forcing. Given F=B_r(G,\rho), take an arbitrary boundary vertex b\in L_r(F). Extend F outward to radius r+3 as follows:
- Add a new path b\mbox{--}y\mbox{--}z of length 2, placing y at distance r+1 and z at distance r+2 from the root.
- Attach H at z by identifying its special vertex with z; include all of H within the (r+3)-ball. Inside this ball, every vertex of H\setminus\{z\} has degree D, and z currently has degree D-1 within H and becomes degree D after adding the edge yz.
- Do not add any other edges incident to vertices of H within the ball.
Call the resulting ball F'. Then for any D-regular extension (G',\rho') with B_{r+3}(G',\rho')\cong F', the edge yz is a bridge: removing yz disconnects the finite component S consisting of H\cup\{z\} from the rest of G'. Indeed, every vertex of S has degree D already inside S (z’s Dth edge is yz), so no extension can add further edges incident to S by the degree constraint; hence yz is the only edge leaving S, and yz is a 1-way infinite bridge.

Thus, for odd D, the set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense under any topology that contains the local cylinders as open sets (in particular, under d_\bullet).

No-go for refinements and for topologically equivalent metrics

Corollary 7. Let \tau be any topology on \mathbf G_{\bullet,\le D} or \mathbf G_{\bullet,=D} (odd D) that refines the local topology. Then the bridgeless set is nowhere dense in (\mathbf G_{\bullet,D},\tau).
Proof. It is nowhere dense under d_\bullet by the forcing above (odd-regular) and by the arguments in the paper (degree-bounded). Apply Proposition 2.

Corollary 8. Any metric on \mathbf G_{\bullet,D} yielding the same topology as d_\bullet (e.g., any weighted-local or FO-local metric) preserves typicality of all properties, in particular of “bridgeless.”

Examples and checks
- For D=3, an explicit H is obtained by taking any 3-regular graph R and deleting a perfect matching of size 1 (one edge) is insufficient; instead delete t=1 edge u_1v_1 and attach z adjacent to u_1 and v_1. This yields deg(z)=2=D-1, all other degrees 3. The path b–y–z and the block H saturate S, forcing yz as a bridge in any 3-regular extension.
- For degree-bounded spaces \mathbf G_{\bullet,\le D}, the same odd-D gadget forces a 1-way bridge. For even D, this particular 1-way bridge forcing fails in \mathbf G_{\bullet,=D} by Lemma 5, but remains valid in \mathbf G_{\bullet,\le D} (since an infinite extension exists that keeps degrees \le D while leaving S sealed), thereby matching the statement “bridgeless is nowhere dense in \mathbf G_{\bullet,\le D} for all D>2.”

Caveat and obstacle (clarifying scope)
- The 1-way bridge forcing by sealing a finite component S relies on the degree constraint to prevent any new edges out of S in extensions; hence it works in \le D and in odd-regular, but is impossible in even-regular by Lemma 5. For forcing a 2-way infinite bridge purely locally, extra care is needed because an extension may add a path entirely outside the ball connecting the two sides; local sealing cannot forbid such a path. This explains why Theorem 16 only proves meagreness (not nowhere-denseness) of the 2-way bridge set.

Consequences for the conjecture
- There is no “natural” alternative metric among the usual local/coding/logical metrics that changes typicality: they are topologically equivalent to the Benjamini–Schramm metric; typicality is a topological notion.
- No refinement of the local topology can make bridgeless typical in \mathbf G_{\bullet,\le D} (D>2) or in \mathbf G_{\bullet,=D} for odd D: the bridgeless set is nowhere dense in the local topology and remains so in any refinement.
- In \mathbf G_{\bullet,=D} with even D, bridgeless graphs are already comeagre under d_\bullet.

Next steps
- Formalize the general “no-go class”: topologies whose basic opens contain (or are unions of) local cylinders. Prove rigorously that in \mathbf G_{\bullet,\le D} (D>2) bridgeless is nowhere dense under any such topology by a uniform sealing argument, and that in \mathbf G_{\bullet,=D} (odd D) the odd-regular gadget above suffices.
- Catalogue alternative metrics in the literature and verify they are topologically equivalent to, or refinements of, the local topology (weighted locals, FO-locals). This will close the “natural alternative” front in the negative for the hard regimes.
- If one seeks a genuine change in typical properties, one must consider topologies strictly coarser than local (e.g., end-sensitive tail topologies). Determine whether these are Baire and whether they make “bridgeless” comeagre. This remains open; care is needed to avoid trivial or non-Polish constructions.

Summary
- We proved that within a large class of natural alternatives (topologically equivalent or finer than local), typicality does not change. Weighted local and FO-local metrics fall here. Bridgeless is nowhere dense in \mathbf G_{\bullet,\le D} (D>2) and in \mathbf G_{\bullet,=D} for odd D; in even-regular it is already comeagre. We supplied an explicit odd-regular forcing gadget that seals a finite component, making a 1-way infinite bridge unavoidable in any extension. The only plausible route to different typical behavior is via coarser, genuinely nonlocal topologies; their Baire nature and impact on bridges remain to be established.
