  "summary_md": "This round replaces the incorrect pendant\u2011leaf forcing by a robust \u201csaturated bubble\u201d construction: attach a finite connected subgraph H whose vertices are degree\u2011D (except one internal vertex of degree D\u22121) and join H to the core by a single edge e; after saturating degrees inside the ball e is forced to be a bridge in every admissible extension. Using this, we show that for any cylinder\u2011rich / cylinder\u2011open topology (which includes the standard local metric d_\u2022 and many natural local metrics) the set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense in G_{\u2022,\u2264D} for all D\u22652 and in G_{\u2022,=D} for odd D\u22653. By a parity lemma, even D\u2011regular graphs cannot have 1\u2011way bridges; we prove the set of graphs with a 2\u2011way infinite bridge is dense but meagre for D>2, hence bridgeless is comeagre in the even D\u2011regular local space. Nonlocal metrics can change openness trivially, but any alternative must be shown metrizable/Baire and to have the required density properties. Citations: papers/paper1.txt; round research notes.",
