## Setting

- Fix an integer \(D \ge 2\).
- Let \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) be the space of **countably infinite, connected, rooted graphs** \((G,\rho)\).
- For \((G,\rho) \in \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) and \(r \in \mathbb{N}\), let \(B_r(G,\rho)\) denote the rooted (closed) ball of radius \(r\) about \(\rho\).
- Equip \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) with the **local (Benjamini–Schramm) metric** \(d_\bullet\) given by
  \[
  d_\bullet\big((G,\rho),(H,\sigma)\big)=2^{-R},
  \qquad
  R=\sup\{r\in\mathbb{N} : B_r(G,\rho)\cong B_r(H,\sigma)\}.
  \]
  (Equivalently, \(d_\bullet((G,\rho),(H,\sigma))<2^{-r}\) iff \(B_r(G,\rho)\cong B_r(H,\sigma)\).)
- Degree‑constrained subspaces:
  - \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\): all rooted graphs with \(\Delta(G)\le D\).
  - \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,= D}\): all rooted graphs with \(\Delta(G)= D\).
  We write \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for either of these when the distinction is unimportant.
- A subset \(S\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) is **nowhere dense** if the interior of \(\overline{S}\) is empty. A set is **meagre** (first category) if it is a countable union of nowhere dense sets; its complement is **comeagre**. A property is called **typical** if the corresponding set is comeagre.
- An edge \(e\) of an (unrooted) graph \(G\) is a **bridge** if \(G-e\) has more connected components than \(G\). A bridge is **2‑way infinite** if both components are infinite and **1‑way infinite** otherwise.

---
Prove or disprove:


## Conjecture — Metric sensitivity of typicality
There exists a **natural alternative metric** on the same underlying set \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for which the collection of **typical properties** differs from those under \(d_\bullet\). In particular, determine whether there is a reasonable metric in which **bridgeless graphs are typical**, or prove that no such metric can change their typicality.

Working hypothesis: Robustness of bridge atypicality under tame topologies.

Definitions (to be formalized):
- A tame topology on X=G_{\bullet,D} has a countable base consisting of sets A(F,Π), where F is a rooted r-ball and Π is a finite boundary datum on a finite subset S of the boundary L_r(F). Π should specify: (i) residual degree budget at each v∈S (an integer in [0,D−deg_F(v)]), and (ii) finitely many local forbiddances of new adjacencies between specified boundary atoms; any completion must respect these.
- Basic cylinders C(F)=\{G: B_r(G)≅F\} are special cases A(F,∅). The topology is required to be generated by these A(F,Π), and the space should be Polish (hence Baire).

Goal: For all tame τ and for X=G_{\bullet,≤D} (D>2) and X=G_{\bullet,=D} with odd D, the bridgeless set is nowhere dense. For even D regular, bridgeless is already comeagre under d_• (1‑way bridges impossible; 2‑way bridges meagre), so no flip is needed.

Bridge‑forcing sketch (≤D):
- Given nonempty A(F,Π), extend F to a larger ball F′ by attaching a finite tree gadget T outside a buffered annulus so that exactly one edge e crosses from F‑side to T‑side, and saturate degrees of all vertices on both sides that could create additional outside connections. Ensure T is disjoint from S so Π is unaffected.
- In any completion respecting Π, degrees on the cut interface are saturated; hence no new outside edge can connect T to the rest, and e remains the unique cut‑edge, i.e., a bridge. Also leave ample unsaturated boundary elsewhere to admit infinite completions.

Odd D regular gadget: Replace the degree‑saturation by a D‑regular odd gadget ensuring a unique cut‑edge while keeping all degrees exactly D. To be written in full detail (parity bookkeeping, buffer, and compatibility with Π).

Planned verification checklists:
- Precisely define Π and show A(F,Π) form a base; prove nonemptiness criteria and that the space is Polish.
- Show common “finite‑coding” metrics (weighted sums of finitely many r‑ball tests) are tame.
- Write the bridge‑forcing lemma rigorously for ≤D and odd D regular.
- Explore whether logical/Stone topologies are tame; if not, test whether bridge‑forcing still yields nowhere denseness.


Agenda and corrections

- Robust bridge forcing: Attaching a leaf or a short pendant path does NOT force a bridge in all extensions, since extensions may add edges at the leaf. Correct forcing uses a finite D‑saturated bubble on one side: build a finite connected subgraph H whose vertices all have degree D (in \le D) or exactly D (in =D), except a designated vertex w with degree D−1 inside H; connect w to a boundary vertex u in the core by a single edge e=uw. Saturate all vertices of H (including w after adding e) to degree D within the prescribed ball, and do not add any other edges between H and the core. Then in every extension respecting the degree bound, no new edges can be added at H, so e remains the unique edge across the cut and is a bridge. The H side is finite; the other side can be extended to infinity via other boundary vertices.
- Cylinder‑rich topologies: We call a topology cylinder‑rich if for every open neighborhood U of x there exists r with the cylinder {y: B_r(y)≅B_r(x)} contained in U. This covers the local metric and many natural local metrics (weighted multi‑radius edit distances, etc.). In any cylinder‑rich topology, the above gadget yields a cylinder on which every graph has a bridge, so bridgeless sets are nowhere dense in G_{•,≤D} and in G_{•,=D} for odd D.
- Even D‑regular parity: In D‑regular graphs with even D, every bridge is 2‑way infinite; 1‑way infinite bridges are impossible by degree‑sum parity on a finite component.
- Nonlocal attempts: Adding a global boolean “has a bridge” coordinate makes that property open and cannot render “bridgeless” typical. An end‑sensitive topology may alter typicality but needs proof of metrizability/Baire property and density arguments to rule out 1‑edge cuts.

Open tasks
- Formalize the saturated‑bubble construction in regular (=D) odd case, including existence of infinite D‑regular extensions realizing the refined ball.
- Prove (or refute) that “has a 2‑way infinite bridge” is meagre in ≤D and =D; this would imply comeagre bridgeless for even D.
- Specify and study a natural nonlocal, Baire topology (e.g., end‑profile inverse limit) where bridgeless might be typical; verify all topological properties first.

Refinements and corrections to the topology and forcing scheme

- Cylinder‑open vs cylinder‑rich: For invariance of nowhere‑denseness across alternative metrics/topologies, we require that the new topology contains the local (Benjamini–Schramm) cylinders as open sets (call such topologies cylinder‑open). The weaker condition that each open set contains some local cylinder (cylinder‑rich) is insufficient to transfer category statements.

- Robust bridge forcing (final): Pendant leaves do not force bridges. Use a finite saturated bubble H attached by a single edge e to the core so that every vertex of H has degree D within the prescribed ball (and degree exactly D in the =D case). Then e remains a bridge in every completion. This works uniformly in ≤D and in =D for odd D; it is impossible for even D in the =D case due to parity (only 2‑way bridges can occur).

- 2‑way infinite bridges (D>2): For each k, the property “there is a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance ≤k” is nowhere dense. Construction: inside any cylinder, classify edges within distance ≤k as safe (one side has no boundary vertex with residual degree <D, hence cannot become infinite in any completion) or critical (both sides have a boundary vertex with residual degree). For critical edges, add one new neighbor to each such boundary vertex and link all these new neighbors into a single external cycle just outside the base radius; then each critical edge lies on a finite cycle entirely within a slightly larger ball. This yields meagreness of the union over k, and density follows by attaching two infinite branches connected by a single edge far outside.

- Even D‑regular: By parity, bridges are necessarily 2‑way infinite; with the meagreness above, bridgeless graphs are comeagre under the local topology.

Open items
- Provide a canonical odd‑regular finite bubble (e.g., a chain of K_{D+1}−e gadgets) and a clean extension existence lemma in =D.
- Catalog natural alternative metrics that are cylinder‑open (equivalent reweightings, FO‑local, decorated locals) and record invariance. Investigate genuinely nonlocal, Baire topologies if one seeks a change in typicality.

Two-way infinite bridges are dense meagre; bridgeless is comeagre for even D-regular

Setup: For D>2, fix k and let P_k be the set of rooted graphs that have a 2-way infinite bridge at distance ≤k. For any realized r-ball F with r≥k, construct an extension H by attaching, to each boundary vertex v with deg_F(v)<D, a new vertex x_v at distance r+1 and then connecting the x_v along a single cycle via additional new vertices outside B_r. Choose the construction so that at least one new vertex (on the outside cycle) still has residual degree to allow an infinite continuation; this ensures nonemptiness of the refined cylinder.

Key observations:
- If, in F−e, one side of an edge e at distance ≤k contains no boundary vertex with residual degree, then in any completion within the cylinder C(F) that side cannot become infinite, so e can never be a 2-way infinite bridge.
- Otherwise, pick boundary vertices v_A and v_B with residual degree on the two sides. In H there is a path from v_A to v_B outside B_r, so every such e lies on a cycle contained in B_{r+2}(H). Therefore, with F′=B_{r+2}(H), the cylinder C(F′) contains no graph from P_k.
Thus P_k is nowhere dense. Taking P=⋃_k P_k, we get that the set of graphs with a 2-way infinite bridge is meagre. The same construction shows P is dense by adding, in any cylinder, a far-away double ray connected by a single edge. For even D-regular graphs, any bridge is 2-way infinite; hence bridgeless is comeagre under the local topology.

Cylinder-rich (strongly local) topologies: A topology is cylinder‑rich if every open neighborhood around x contains a local cylinder C(B_r(x)). In any such topology, the sealed finite-component (“saturated bubble”) forcing shows bridgeless is nowhere dense in G_{•,≤D} and in G_{•,=D} for odd D. This covers many natural local metrics (weighted sums of r-ball disagreements, FO-local, edit-on-balls).

# Main Results




=== Verifier Summary ===

Replaced invalid leaf forcing by a sealed finite “saturated bubble” that forces a bridge in every completion. Proved: in any cylinder‑rich (strongly local) metric/topology, bridgeless graphs are nowhere dense in G_{•,≤D} and in G_{•,=D} for odd D. Supplied a full proof that “2‑way infinite bridges” form a dense meagre set for D>2; with the even‑regular parity lemma, this implies bridgeless is comeagre for even D under the standard metric. Flagged the false monotonicity claim under refinement; invariance should be stated for cylinder‑rich topologies. Next: formalize the metric class, ensure Baire/Polish properties, and add explicit completion lemmas for the regular case.

Working hypothesis: Robustness of bridge atypicality under tame topologies.

Definitions (to be formalized):
- A tame topology on X=G_{\bullet,D} has a countable base consisting of sets A(F,Π), where F is a rooted r-ball and Π is a finite boundary datum on a finite subset S of the boundary L_r(F). Π should specify: (i) residual degree budget at each v∈S (an integer in [0,D−deg_F(v)]), and (ii) finitely many local forbiddances of new adjacencies between specified boundary atoms; any completion must respect these.
- Basic cylinders C(F)=\{G: B_r(G)≅F\} are special cases A(F,∅). The topology is required to be generated by these A(F,Π), and the space should be Polish (hence Baire).

Goal: For all tame τ and for X=G_{\bullet,≤D} (D>2) and X=G_{\bullet,=D} with odd D, the bridgeless set is nowhere dense. For even D regular, bridgeless is already comeagre under d_• (1‑way bridges impossible; 2‑way bridges meagre), so no flip is needed.

Bridge‑forcing sketch (≤D):
- Given nonempty A(F,Π), extend F to a larger ball F′ by attaching a finite tree gadget T outside a buffered annulus so that exactly one edge e crosses from F‑side to T‑side, and saturate degrees of all vertices on both sides that could create additional outside connections. Ensure T is disjoint from S so Π is unaffected.
- In any completion respecting Π, degrees on the cut interface are saturated; hence no new outside edge can connect T to the rest, and e remains the unique cut‑edge, i.e., a bridge. Also leave ample unsaturated boundary elsewhere to admit infinite completions.

Odd D regular gadget: Replace the degree‑saturation by a D‑regular odd gadget ensuring a unique cut‑edge while keeping all degrees exactly D. To be written in full detail (parity bookkeeping, buffer, and compatibility with Π).

Agenda and corrections

- Robust bridge forcing: Attaching a leaf or a short pendant path does NOT force a bridge in all extensions, since extensions may add edges at the leaf. Correct forcing uses a finite D‑saturated bubble on one side: build a finite connected subgraph H whose vertices all have degree D (in \le D) or exactly D (in =D), except a designated vertex w with degree D−1 inside H; connect w to a boundary vertex u in the core by a single edge e=uw. Saturate all vertices of H (including w after adding e) to degree D within the prescribed ball, and do not add any other edges between H and the core. Then in every extension respecting the degree bound, no new edges can be added at H, so e remains the unique edge across the cut and is a bridge. The H side is finite; the other side can be extended to infinity via other boundary vertices.
- Cylinder‑rich topologies: We call a topology cylinder‑rich if for every open neighborhood U of x there exists r with the cylinder {y: B_r(y)≅B_r(x)} contained in U. This covers the local metric and many natural local metrics (weighted multi‑radius edit distances, etc.). In any cylinder‑rich topology, the above gadget yields a cylinder on which every graph has a bridge, so bridgeless sets are nowhere dense in G_{•,≤D} and in G_{•,=D} for odd D.
- Even D‑regular parity: In D‑regular graphs with even D, every bridge is 2‑way infinite; 1‑way infinite bridges are impossible by degree‑sum parity on a finite component.
- Nonlocal attempts: Adding a global boolean “has a bridge” coordinate makes that property open and cannot render “bridgeless” typical. An end‑sensitive topology may alter typicality but needs proof of metrizability/Baire property and density arguments to rule out 1‑edge cuts.

Open tasks
- Formalize the saturated‑bubble construction in regular (=D) odd case, including existence of infinite D‑regular extensions realizing the refined ball.
- Prove (or refute) that “has a 2‑way infinite bridge” is meagre in ≤D and =D; this would imply comeagre bridgeless for even D.
- Specify and study a natural nonlocal, Baire topology (e.g., end‑profile inverse limit) where bridgeless might be typical; verify all topological properties first.

Refinements and corrections to the topology and forcing scheme

- Cylinder‑open vs cylinder‑rich: For invariance of nowhere‑denseness across alternative metrics/topologies, we require that the new topology contains the local (Benjamini–Schramm) cylinders as open sets (call such topologies cylinder‑open). The weaker condition that each open set contains some local cylinder (cylinder‑rich) is insufficient to transfer category statements.

- Robust bridge forcing (final): Pendant leaves do not force bridges. Use a finite saturated bubble H attached by a single edge e to the core so that every vertex of H has degree D within the prescribed ball (and degree exactly D in the =D case). Then e remains a bridge in every completion. This works uniformly in ≤D and in =D for odd D; it is impossible for even D in the =D case due to parity (only 2‑way bridges can occur).

- 2‑way infinite bridges (D>2): For each k, the property “there is a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance ≤k” is nowhere dense. Construction: inside any cylinder, classify edges within distance ≤k as safe (one side has no boundary vertex with residual degree <D, hence cannot become infinite in any completion) or critical (both sides have a boundary vertex with residual degree). For critical edges, add one new neighbor to each such boundary vertex and link all these new neighbors into a single external cycle just outside the base radius; then each critical edge lies on a finite cycle entirely within a slightly larger ball. This yields meagreness of the union over k, and density follows by attaching two infinite branches connected by a single edge far outside.

- Even D‑regular: By parity, bridges are necessarily 2‑way infinite; with the meagreness above, bridgeless graphs are comeagre under the local topology.

Open items
- Provide a canonical odd‑regular finite bubble (e.g., a chain of K_{D+1}−e gadgets) and a clean extension existence lemma in =D.
- Catalog natural alternative metrics that are cylinder‑open (equivalent reweightings, FO‑local, decorated locals) and record invariance. Investigate genuinely nonlocal, Baire topologies if one seeks a change in typicality.

Two-way infinite bridges are dense meagre; bridgeless is comeagre for even D-regular

Setup: For D>2, fix k and let P_k be the set of rooted graphs that have a 2-way infinite bridge at distance ≤k. For any realized r-ball F with r≥k, construct an extension H by attaching, to each boundary vertex v with deg_F(v)<D, a new vertex x_v at distance r+1 and then connecting the x_v along a single cycle via additional new vertices outside B_r. Choose the construction so that at least one new vertex (on the outside cycle) still has residual degree to allow an infinite continuation; this ensures nonemptiness of the refined cylinder.

Key observations:
- If, in F−e, one side of an edge e at distance ≤k contains no boundary vertex with residual degree, then in any completion within the cylinder C(F) that side cannot become infinite, so e can never be a 2-way infinite bridge.
- Otherwise, pick boundary vertices v_A and v_B with residual degree on the two sides. In H there is a path from v_A to v_B outside B_r, so every such e lies on a cycle contained in B_{r+2}(H). Therefore, with F′=B_{r+2}(H), the cylinder C(F′) contains no graph from P_k.
Thus P_k is nowhere dense. Taking P=⋃_k P_k, we get that the set of graphs with a 2-way infinite bridge is meagre. The same construction shows P is dense by adding, in any cylinder, a far-away double ray connected by a single edge. For even D-regular graphs, any bridge is 2-way infinite; hence bridgeless is comeagre under the local topology.

Cylinder-rich (strongly local) topologies: A topology is cylinder‑rich if every open neighborhood around x contains a local cylinder C(B_r(x)). In any such topology, the sealed finite-component (“saturated bubble”) forcing shows bridgeless is nowhere dense in G_{•,≤D} and in G_{•,=D} for odd D. This covers many natural local metrics (weighted sums of r-ball disagreements, FO-local, edit-on-balls).

# Rigorous Proofs



Definitions

- Let X be either G_{•,≤D} (all connected rooted graphs with max degree ≤D) or G_{•,=D} (all connected rooted D‑regular rooted graphs), D≥2. For a rooted graph (G,ρ), denote by B_r(G,ρ) its rooted r‑ball and by Cyl(F) the set of rooted graphs whose r‑ball equals F.
- A topology T on X is cylinder‑rich if for every open neighborhood U∈T and every x∈U there exists r such that Cyl(B_r(x))⊆U.

Lemma 1 (Parity in even‑regular graphs). In a countably infinite D‑regular graph with even D, every bridge is 2‑way infinite (after deleting a bridge, both components are infinite).
Proof. Suppose e separates a finite component C. Then ∑_{v∈C}deg_G(v)=D|C| is even, while in G−e the degree sum in C equals 2|E(C)|+1, which is odd. Contradiction.

Lemma 2 (Bridge‑forcing cylinder for ≤D). Fix D≥2. Let F be any realized r‑ball in X=G_{•,≤D}. Then there exists R>r and a realized R‑ball F′ with the following property: for every (G,ρ) with B_R(G,ρ)≅F′, the graph G contains a bridge e whose finite side lies entirely inside B_R(G,ρ), and e remains a bridge in every extension of B_R(G,ρ) respecting the degree bound.
Proof. Choose a boundary vertex u at distance r with deg_F(u)<D (existence follows since the graph is infinite). Build a finite connected graph H disjoint from F and a new vertex w∈V(H) so that: (i) every vertex of H\{w} has degree D within H, (ii) w has degree D−1 within H, and (iii) H contains no edges to F. Form F′ by adjoining H to F and adding the single edge e=uw. Inside F′, saturate all vertices of H to degree D (already true after adding e) and add edges within the F‑side (using new vertices on the F‑side only) to keep all degrees ≤D and maintain connectivity of the F‑side around the root. Leave at least one boundary vertex on the F‑side with spare degree to allow an infinite continuation. Then in any extension of F′ with maximum degree ≤D: no vertex of H can be incident to new edges (all have degree D), so the only possible edges between H and the rest are those already present; thus removing e disconnects H from the rest, so e is a bridge. The H‑side is finite; the F‑side can be extended to an infinite graph via a boundary vertex with spare degree. Hence Cyl(F′) is nonempty and every member has a (1‑way infinite) bridge.

Lemma 3 (Bridge‑forcing cylinder for =D, odd D). Fix odd D≥3. Let F be any realized r‑ball in X=G_{•,=D}. Then there exists R>r and a realized R‑ball F′ such that every (G,ρ) with B_R(G,ρ)≅F′ contains a bridge e, and e remains a bridge in all D‑regular extensions of F′.
Proof. Pick a boundary vertex u at distance r; inside F, deg_F(u)≤D, with at least one missing incident edge reserved for connections outside. Construct a finite connected D‑regular block H_0 and choose a vertex w_0∈V(H_0). Replace at w_0 one internal edge by a short tree‑like patch so that within the H‑side the vertex w has degree D−1 and every other vertex has degree D; denote the result by H and its special vertex by w. Form F′ by adjoining H and adding the single edge e=uw. On the F‑side, add edges and finitely many vertices (all within radius R) to saturate u to degree D while keeping the F‑side connected, and ensure at least one other boundary vertex retains spare stubs for infinite continuation. On the H‑side, every vertex has total degree D in F′ (w gains its final incident edge via e), so no extension can add edges at H; thus e remains the unique edge between H and the rest in any D‑regular extension, hence a bridge. Existence of an infinite D‑regular extension realizing F′ follows by continuing from a boundary vertex on the F‑side using a standard infinite D‑regular construction (e.g., attach a rooted copy of the D‑regular tree and adjust locally with finite D‑regular patches as needed); only the outside of radius R is modified, so B_R equals F′.

Theorem 4 (Bridgeless is nowhere dense for cylinder‑rich topologies). Let T be a cylinder‑rich topology on X.
- If X=G_{•,≤D} with D≥2, the set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense in (X,T).
- If X=G_{•,=D} with odd D≥3, the set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense in (X,T).
Proof. Let U be a nonempty T‑open set and x∈U. By cylinder‑richness, there exists r with Cyl(B_r(x))⊆U. Apply Lemma 2 (≤D) or Lemma 3 (=D odd) to obtain F′ extending B_r(x) such that Cyl(F′)⊆Cyl(B_r(x)) and every graph in Cyl(F′) has a bridge e that is preserved in all extensions. In particular, Cyl(F′)∩(bridgeless)=∅, and since the property is enforced by bounded‑radius degree saturation, any limit of graphs from Cyl(F′) still contains e as a bridge; hence cl_T(Cyl(F′))⊆(has a bridge), so Cyl(F′)∩cl_T(bridgeless)=∅. Thus the interior of cl_T(bridgeless) is empty. Therefore bridgeless is nowhere dense.

Remark (even D regular). By Lemma 1, any bridge in =D with even D must be 2‑way infinite. The above one‑sided bubble forcing cannot be used there (it would force a 1‑way bridge and hence yields an empty cylinder). Typicality for “bridgeless” in =D even reduces to understanding the size (Baire‑category) of the set of graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge; this remains to be settled here.

Setup and notation
Let X be either G_{•,≤D} (connected rooted graphs with max degree ≤D) or G_{•,=D} (connected rooted D‑regular graphs), with D≥2. For a rooted graph x=(G,ρ) and r∈N, write F_r(x)=B_r(G,ρ). For a realized r‑ball F, denote the cylinder Cyl(F):={x∈X: F_r(x)≅F}.

Definition (cylinder‑open topologies)
A topology T on X is cylinder‑open if every local cylinder Cyl(F) is T‑open. (Equivalently, T contains the local topology.)

Lemma 1 (parity for even regular). In a countably infinite D‑regular graph with even D, every bridge is 2‑way infinite.
Proof. If removing e leaves a finite component C, then ∑_{v∈C}deg(v)=D|C| is even but also equals 2|E(C)|+1, a contradiction.

Lemma 2 (bridge‑forcing for ≤D). Fix D≥2. For any realized r‑ball F in X=G_{•,≤D}, there exists R>r and a realized R‑ball F′⊇F such that every completion x with F_R(x)≅F′ contains a bridge e whose finite side lies within F′, and e remains a bridge in every completion.
Proof. Pick u∈L_r(F) with deg_F(u)<D (otherwise F cannot extend to an infinite graph). Create a finite connected bubble H disjoint from F, with a designated vertex w of degree D−1 inside H and all other vertices of degree D in H. Set e=uw and include H∪{e} entirely within the annulus {r+1,…,R−1}. Inside this region, add edges among vertices of H (and possibly new auxiliary vertices at radii <R) so that every vertex of H, including w after adding e, has degree D within F′. Do not add any other edges between H and F. Leave at least one vertex on the F‑side boundary with residual degree to allow infinite continuation. In any completion with F_R=F′, no vertex of H can receive further incident edges (already degree D), hence the only edge across the cut (H)–(rest) is e, which is therefore a bridge. The H‑side is finite by construction.

Lemma 3 (bridge‑forcing for =D, odd D). Let D≥3 be odd. For any realized r‑ball F in X=G_{•,=D}, there exist R>r and a realized R‑ball F′⊇F such that every D‑regular completion x with F_R(x)≅F′ contains a bridge e that persists in all completions.
Proof. Choose u∈L_r(F). Let G_0:=K_{D+1}−e_0 (D+1 vertices, all but two of degree D, the two special vertices of degree D−1). Take a finite chain of copies of G_0 by identifying a special vertex of one copy with a special vertex of the next, restoring degree D at the identified vertex and leaving two special vertices overall. Call one w. Place the chain in the annulus {r+1,…,R−1} and add e=uw. Now all vertices of the chain have degree D within F′ (w’s degree is completed by e). No other edges join the chain to F. Ensure on the F‑side that at least one boundary vertex outside u can still be continued to realize an infinite D‑regular completion (e.g., by attaching disjoint D‑regular trees beyond radius R). In any D‑regular completion with F_R=F′, vertices of the chain cannot receive new edges (already degree D), so e is the unique edge across the cut and hence a bridge. The chain side is finite.

Theorem 4 (bridgeless nowhere dense under cylinder‑open topologies). Let T be a cylinder‑open topology on X.
(i) For X=G_{•,≤D} (D≥2), the set S_br of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense in (X,T).
(ii) For X=G_{•,=D} with odd D≥3, S_br is nowhere dense in (X,T).
Proof. Let U be nonempty T‑open and pick x∈U. Since T is cylinder‑open, there is a cylinder C:=Cyl(F_r(x)) with x∈C⊆U. By Lemma 2 (or Lemma 3), there is R>r and a realized R‑ball F′ with Cyl(F′)⊆C such that every completion in Cyl(F′) has a bridge which persists. Thus Cyl(F′)⊆U and Cyl(F′)∩S_br=∅. Hence every nonempty open set contains a nonempty open subset disjoint from S_br, so int_T(cl_T(S_br))=∅ and S_br is nowhere dense.

Meagreness of 2‑way infinite bridges
For D>2, let S_{2wb}⊂X be the set of graphs containing a 2‑way infinite bridge.

Lemma 5 (nowhere dense at fixed radius). Fix k∈N and D>2. The set S_k of graphs having a 2‑way infinite bridge whose edge lies at distance ≤k from the root is nowhere dense in the local topology.
Proof. Let Cyl(F) be any nonempty cylinder with r≥k+2. Consider the set E_k of edges of F within distance ≤k from the root, viewed inside the finite graph F. For an edge e∈E_k, let F−e partition the vertex set of F into two sides A_e,B_e. Call e safe if at least one side (say A_e) contains no boundary vertex v∈L_r(F) with deg_F(v)<D; equivalently, every boundary vertex on A_e has deg_F(v)=D (or there is no boundary vertex on A_e). In any completion x∈Cyl(F), vertices not on the boundary cannot gain new neighbors; boundary vertices with deg_F(v)=D cannot gain new neighbors either. Hence in every completion, the component corresponding to A_e remains finite, and e cannot be a 2‑way infinite bridge.
For a critical edge e, both A_e and B_e contain a boundary vertex with deg_F(v)<D; pick v_A∈A_e∩L_r(F) and v_B∈B_e∩L_r(F) with deg_F(v_A),deg_F(v_B)<D. Extend F outside radius r by adding a new neighbor x_v to every boundary vertex v with deg_F(v)<D, and then connect all such x_v along a simple cycle using new edges and (if needed) new auxiliary vertices, all placed at distances r+1 or r+2 from the root. Let H be the resulting finite extension and R:=r+2. For the critical e, in H there is a path from one endpoint of e to v_A inside A_e⊆F (disjoint from e), then the edge (v_A,x_{v_A}), then along the external cycle to x_{v_B}, then to v_B, and finally inside B_e⊆F to the other endpoint, giving a path between the endpoints of e disjoint from e. Hence e lies on a cycle contained in B_R(H). Put F′:=B_R(H). Then Cyl(F′)⊆Cyl(F) and no x∈Cyl(F′) contains a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance ≤k. Therefore S_k is nowhere dense.

Theorem 6 (S_{2wb} is dense meagre for D>2). For D>2, in both X=G_{•,≤D} and X=G_{•,=D}, the set S_{2wb} is meagre and dense in the local topology.
Proof. Meagre: S_{2wb}=⋃_{k∈N} S_k and each S_k is nowhere dense by Lemma 5. Density: Given any cylinder Cyl(F), choose two distinct boundary vertices v_1,v_2 with deg_F(v_i)<D (existence is immediate in =D and otherwise by extending r if needed). Outside a sufficiently large radius, build two disjoint infinite D‑bounded branches T_1,T_2, connect the core only to T_1 by a long path, and connect T_1 to T_2 by a single edge e so that the whole graph remains within degree bound (and D‑regular in the =D case by using D‑regular trees). Then e is a 2‑way infinite bridge. By placing all modifications beyond some radius R, we get Cyl(B_R)⊆Cyl(F) consisting of graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge. Thus S_{2wb} meets every cylinder and is dense.

Corollary 7 (even D‑regular: bridgeless is comeagre). For even D>2 on X=G_{•,=D}, every bridge is 2‑way infinite (Lemma 1), and S_{2wb} is meagre (Theorem 6). Hence the set of bridgeless graphs is comeagre in the local topology. The same holds for any cylinder‑open topology containing the local one.


Theorem A (2-way infinite bridges are meagre and dense for D>2).
Let X be either G_{•,≤D} or G_{•,=D} with D>2 under the local topology. For each k∈N, the set P_k of graphs that contain a 2-way infinite bridge at distance ≤k from the root is nowhere dense. Hence P=⋃_{k} P_k is meagre. Moreover, P is dense in X.

Proof.
Fix k and a realized cylinder C(F) with F=B_r(G,ρ), r≥k. Let S be the set of boundary vertices v∈L_r(F) with deg_F(v)<D. If S=∅, then no completion from C(F) can produce a 2-way infinite bridge with both sides escaping beyond B_r, so P_k∩C(F)=∅ and we are done by taking F′=F.
Assume S≠∅. For each v∈S, add a new vertex x_v at distance r+1 adjacent to v. Next connect the set {x_v: v∈S} into a single simple cycle by inserting new vertices outside B_{r+1} as needed so that degrees of all new vertices stay ≤D (this is always possible since D>2). Ensure at least one new vertex on this cycle retains residual degree (e.g., make one cycle node of degree 2), guaranteeing nonemptiness of the refined cylinder by allowing infinite continuation beyond radius r+2. Let H be the resulting extension and set F′=B_{r+2}(H).
Consider any edge e within distance ≤k from the root. If in F−e one side has no vertex from S, then in any completion from C(F) that side cannot be infinite (no boundary vertex there has residual capacity), so e cannot be a 2-way infinite bridge. Otherwise there exist v_A,v_B∈S on distinct sides of e. In H there is a path from v_A to v_B outside B_r via the cycle; concatenating with paths inside F from the endpoints of e to v_A and v_B (avoiding e) yields a cycle passing through e wholly contained in B_{r+2}(H). Therefore, for any completion with r+2-ball equal to F′, e is not a bridge. It follows that C(F′)⊆C(F) and C(F′)∩P_k=∅. Since C(F) was arbitrary, P_k is nowhere dense. As P=⋃_k P_k, P is meagre.
For density, let C(F) be any cylinder. Outside some large radius R≫r, attach two disjoint infinite D‑bounded rays and connect them by a single edge e; then connect the core to exactly one ray by a long path. This yields an element of C(F) with a 2‑way infinite bridge e. Hence P is dense.

Lemma B (Parity obstruction in even‑regular graphs).
In a D‑regular infinite graph with even D, every bridge is 2‑way infinite.
Proof. If removing e leaves a finite component C, then ∑_{v∈C}deg(v)=D|C| is even, while in G−e it equals 2|E(C)|+1, a contradiction.

Corollary C (Bridgeless is comeagre in even‑regular spaces).
In X=G_{•,=D} with even D>2 under the local topology, the set of graphs with a bridge equals P (by Lemma B) and is meagre (Theorem A). Its complement (bridgeless) is therefore comeagre.

Theorem D (Bridgeless is nowhere dense in cylinder‑rich topologies for ≤D and odd‑regular).
Let T be a cylinder‑rich topology on X. Then the set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense in G_{•,≤D} for D≥3 and in G_{•,=D} for odd D≥3.
Proof. Let U∈T be nonempty and x∈U. By cylinder‑richness, there is r with C(B_r(x))⊆U. Build a finite sealed set S within some larger radius R so that: (i) all vertices of S have total degree D inside B_R, (ii) there is exactly one edge e between S and V(B_R)\S, and (iii) there remains at least one vertex outside S with residual capacity to permit infinite completions (≤D) or a D‑regular completion (odd D). Then every graph in C(B_R(x)) contains the bridge e, hence U contains a nonempty open subset disjoint from the bridgeless set. Therefore bridgeless is nowhere dense in (X,T).

### Typical properties of countable graphs: flows and bridges  
*(Extended abstract)*  

**Robert Šámal**\* · **Hadi Zamani**\*

#### Abstract
We have two aims. **First**, we study nowhere‑zero flows in countably infinite graphs, observing the different roles of two types of bridges. **Second**, we study how typical graphs with these types of bridges are. As there is no natural probability measure to use, we turn to an analytic approach: we study which sets are nowhere dense and which are meagre.

In finite graphs, bridges play a crucial role—it is easy to see that every flow assigns value \(0\) to every bridge. It is also known that graphs with a bridge are not typical: both dense random graphs and random regular graphs are bridgeless w.h.p. [3, 1]. We ask how this transfers to countable graphs. In Section 1 we explain differences between bridges and flows and, via compactness, we prove a version of Seymour’s 6‑flow theorem for countable graphs.

In Section 2 we explore nowhere‑dense and meagre sets. This is called for because the usual probabilistic models collapse: extending Erdős–Rényi to countably infinite graphs yields the Rado graph a.s., so we are effectively studying a single graph up to isomorphism. Attempting random regular graphs via the configuration model [1] would require a uniform distribution on perfect matchings of a countable set (e.g., neighbors of the first vertex), which does not exist. Consequently, we turn to Baire category: meagre/co‑meagre sets (also “first/second category”).

### 1. Nowhere‑zero flows for infinite graphs

**Definition 1 (weak flow).**  
Given an orientation \(D\) of a graph \(G\) and an abelian group \(A\), a **weak \(A\)‑flow** is a function \(\varphi:E(G)\to A\) such that **Kirchhoff’s law for each vertex cut** holds:
\[
\forall v\in V(G):\quad \sum_{e\in \delta^-(v)}\varphi(e)=\sum_{e\in \delta^+(v)}\varphi(e).
\]

**Definition 2 (strong flow).**  
Given \(D,G,A\) as above, a **strong \(A\)‑flow** is a function \(\varphi:E(G)\to A\) such that **Kirchhoff’s law for each cut** holds:
\[
\forall S\subseteq V(G):\quad \sum_{e\in \delta^+(S)}\varphi(e)=\sum_{e\in \delta^-(S)}\varphi(e).
\]

In either case, \(\varphi\) is a **nowhere‑zero** weak/strong \(A\)‑flow if \(\varphi^{-1}(0)=\varnothing\).

**Definition 3 (bridge).**  
An edge \(e\) of \(G\) is a **bridge** if deleting \(e\) increases the number of connected components. A bridge is **2‑way infinite** if both resulting components are infinite, and **1‑way infinite** otherwise.

Every strong flow is a weak flow. While the two notions are equivalent on finite graphs, they diverge on infinite graphs: e.g., on a two‑way infinite path, a nowhere‑zero weak \(A\)‑flow exists but a strong one does not. In [6] the authors construct a 3‑connected graph with two ends that admits a nowhere‑zero weak \(A\)‑flow but no nowhere‑zero strong \(A\)‑flow. Nearly all finite flow theorems extend to infinite **strong** \(A\)‑flows via topological compactness; here we use **logical** compactness to obtain:

**Theorem 4.**  
*A countably infinite, locally finite graph without a 1‑way infinite bridge has a nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow.*

### 2. Metric space of rooted connected graphs

Since no good probability measure exists for countable graphs, we study typicality via a metric topology and Baire category.

**Definition 5 (ε‑neighborhood).**  
For a metric space \((X,d)\) and \(x\in X\), the ε‑neighborhood is \(U_\varepsilon(x)=\{y\in X:\ d(x,y)<\varepsilon\}\). The closed neighborhood \(\overline{U}_\varepsilon(x)\) uses \(d(x,y)\le \varepsilon\).

**Definition 6 (open set).**  
A set \(U\subseteq X\) is open if \(\forall x\in U\ \exists \varepsilon>0:\ U_\varepsilon(x)\subseteq U\).

We now fix the graph space and metric.

**Definition 9 (space of rooted graphs).**  
Let \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) be the set of all connected rooted graphs (up to root‑preserving isomorphism). For \(D>2\), let \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) be those with all degrees \(\le D\), and \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) those with all degrees \(=D\).

**Definition 10 (r‑ball).**  
For \((G,v)\), the rooted r‑ball is
\[
B_r(G,v)=(\,G[\{y\in V(G): d(v,y)\le r\}],\,v\,).
\]

**Definition 11 (metric \(d_\bullet\)).**  
For \((G_1,v_1),(G_2,v_2)\in\mathbf{G}_\bullet\),
\[
d_\bullet\big((G_1,v_1),(G_2,v_2)\big)=\inf\{2^{-r} : B_r(G_1,v_1)\cong B_r(G_2,v_2)\}.
\]
This is a metric [5].

**Definition 12 (extensions of an r‑ball).**  
For an r‑ball \(F=B_r(G,v)\), define
\[
\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F=\{(G',v')\in \mathbf{G}_\bullet : B_r(G',v')\cong F\}.
\]

**Lemma 13 (basic facts in \((\mathbf{G}_\bullet,d_\bullet)\)).**  
- For each \((G,x)\), \(r\in\mathbb{N}\), and \(0<\varepsilon<1\):
  \[
  U_{2^{-r}+\varepsilon}((G,x))=U_{2^{-r}}((G,x))=\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{B_r(G,x)}.
  \]
- \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F\) is nonempty if \(F\) is an r‑ball in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) that contains a vertex of degree \< \(D\) at distance \(r\) from the root.
- A subset \(S\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) is nowhere dense iff
  \(\forall\) r‑balls \(F\ \exists\) r′‑ball \(F'\) with \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F'}\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F}\setminus S\).
- For all \(D>2\), \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) is not meagre.

### Main results on typical properties

**Theorem 14.**  
*The set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense (i) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) for all \(D>2\); and (ii) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) for all odd \(D>2\).*  
In D‑regular graphs with even \(D\), 1‑way infinite bridges cannot exist; instead we obtain:

**Theorem 15.**  
*The set of graphs without a cut vertex is nowhere dense in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

**Theorem 16.**  
*The set of graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge is meagre (but not nowhere dense) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

We also considered other (a)typical properties:

**Theorem 17.**  
*The set of graphs with edge‑chromatic number \(D\) is nowhere dense in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

### 3. Proof sketches

**Proof of Theorem 4 (sketch).**  
Let the vertices of \(G\) be \(v_1,v_2,\ldots\) and orient each edge \(\{v_i,v_j\}\) from the smaller to the larger index. For each radius \(r\), augment the r‑ball \(B_r(G,v_1)\) to a finite multigraph \(G_r\) by adding a sink vertex \(v_\infty\) and connecting boundary edges to \(v_\infty\). Introduce Boolean variables \(F_{e,1},\dots,F_{e,6}\) encoding which of six nonzero values an edge \(e\) receives, enforce exclusivity \(\bigvee_i F_{e,i}\) and \(\bigwedge_{j\ne i}\neg F_{e,j}\), and write linear parity constraints at each vertex (Kirchhoff’s law). Let \(F_{G_r}\) be the conjunction over vertices of \(G_r\); then every finite subset of the constraint family \(\{F_{G_r}\}_r\cup\{F_{e,i}\}_e\) is satisfiable (by [7]), hence by compactness [4] the whole set is satisfiable, yielding a nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow on \(G\).

**Proof idea for Theorem 14.**  
Given an r‑ball \(F\), construct an r′‑ball \(F'\) such that every extension of \(F'\) contains a bridge. For \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\), attach a leaf to a boundary vertex of degree \<\(D\). For \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) handle regularity via parity gadgets: define \(S(F)=\sum_{v\in L_r}(D-\deg v)\) where \(L_r\) is the boundary; use \(K_{D+1}-e\) gadgets and tree‑like expansions to force parity \(S(F)=1\), then attach a new vertex to create a bridge. Hence the bridgeless set is nowhere dense.

**Proof idea for Theorem 15.**  
In even \(D\)‑regular graphs, use gadgets to force a cut vertex; in odd \(D\) or degree‑bounded spaces, this also follows from the previous construction.

**Proof idea for Theorem 16.**  
Being “there is a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance \(k\)” is nowhere dense; take a union over \(k\in\mathbb{N}\) to get a meagre (but not nowhere‑dense) set.

**Proof idea for Theorem 17.**  
For each \(D\), there exist \(D\)‑regular graphs with \(\chi'(G)=D+1\) (even \(D\): complete graphs or any odd‑order \(D\)‑regular graph; odd \(D\): by Tutte’s theorem). Removing an edge preserves \(\chi'=D+1\) by parity. Embed parity gadgets within r‑balls so that every extension has edge‑chromatic number \(D+1\), hence the set is nowhere dense.

### 4. Future work (the conjectures)

**Question 18.** *Is the fact that a property is nowhere dense or meagre independent of the root?*  
A change of root gives one type of change of metric; however, many metrics on the space of countable graphs are possible.

**Question 19.** *Is there another metric on \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) where typical properties are different?*  
For instance, is there a metric in which **bridgeless graphs are typical**?

We also aim to investigate additional (a)typical properties in the spirit of Theorem 17.
