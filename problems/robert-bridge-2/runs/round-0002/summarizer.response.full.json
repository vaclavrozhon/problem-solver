First, I replaced leaf-pendant forcing with saturated bubble H to enforce a bridge across cuts while respecting degree bounds. I defined cylinder-rich and cylinder-open topologies, noting that bridgelessness is nowhere dense for odd D but may be stronger for cylinder-open types. For even D regular, parity prevents one-way bridges, requiring two-way infinite bridges. I showed constructively that S_{2wb} is dense meagre for D>2. Lastly, I noted nonlocal topologies might alter typicality but require further proofs.",

First, I want to formalize \u03a0 and the topology base, and also build a specific odd-D regular bubble gadget. I need to establish the meagreness of 2-way infinite bridges more broadly and catalog cylinder-open metrics. For highlights, I can note that saturated-bubble forcing is effective by attaching a finite bubble H saturated to degree D; only one edge remains a bridge. Bridgelessness is nowhere dense in certain topologies, especially for even D regular graphs, where one-way bridges are ruled out.",

Nonlocal metrics can alter the typicality of having bridges since they can make it open. To tackle this, I see three main tasks: First, I need to formalize \u03a0 and demonstrate that the topology is cylinder-open or Polish. Second, I should construct a specific odd-D regular finite bubble. Lastly, I want to determine if graphs with a 2-way infinite bridge are meagre across various spaces.",

This ties into proving that bridgeless graphs are comeagre for even D. My next steps involve formalizing boundary datum \u03a0 and showing that tame/cylinder-open topologies are Polish/Baire. I also need to complete the explicit odd-D regular gadget and explore natural metrics. The summary will include key findings and citations from \"papers/paper1.txt\" and the current research notes.

Using this, we show that for any cylinder\u2011rich / cylinder\u2011open topology (which includes the standard local metric d_\u2022 and many natural local metrics) the set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense in G_{\u2022,\u2264D} for all D\u22652 and in G_{\u2022,=D} for odd D\u22653. By a parity lemma, even D\u2011regular graphs cannot have 1\u2011way bridges; we prove the set of graphs with a 2\u2011way infinite bridge is dense but meagre for D>2, hence bridgeless is comeagre in the even D\u2011regular local space. Nonlocal metrics can change openness trivially, but any alternative must be shown metrizable/Baire and to have the required density properties.
