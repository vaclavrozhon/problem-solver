This round replaces the incorrect pendant‑leaf forcing by a robust “saturated bubble” construction: attach a finite connected subgraph H whose vertices are degree‑D (except one internal vertex of degree D−1) and join H to the core by a single edge e; after saturating degrees inside the ball e is forced to be a bridge in every admissible extension. Using this, we show that for any cylinder‑rich / cylinder‑open topology (which includes the standard local metric d_• and many natural local metrics) the set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense in G_{•,≤D} for all D≥2 and in G_{•,=D} for odd D≥3. By a parity lemma, even D‑regular graphs cannot have 1‑way bridges; we prove the set of graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge is dense but meagre for D>2, hence bridgeless is comeagre in the even D‑regular local space. Nonlocal metrics can change openness trivially, but any alternative must be shown metrizable/Baire and to have the required density properties. Citations: papers/paper1.txt; round research notes.
