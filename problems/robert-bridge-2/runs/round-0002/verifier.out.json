  "feedback_md": "High-level: Good progress toward a robust invariance statement. The key correction is to replace all pendant-leaf arguments by a sealed finite component (\u201csaturated bubble\u201d) that forces a single-edge cut in every completion. Within any topology whose open neighborhoods contain local cylinders (your \u201cstrongly local/cylinder\u2011rich\u201d class), this yields nowhere\u2011denseness of \u201cbridgeless\u201d in \u2264D and in =D for odd D. However, several claims still need fixes, and one topological monotonicity statement is false.\n\nCritical corrections\n- Pendant leaf does not force a bridge: an extension may add edges at the leaf. Use a finite sealed set S contained in a ball: saturate every vertex of S to degree D within the ball, and create exactly one edge e from S to its complement within the ball. Then no completion can add edges at S, so e remains a bridge. In =D (odd), ensure all vertices of S have total degree D in the ball.\n- Parity in even D: P1\u2019s internal lump T with degrees (D,\u2026,D,D\u22121) is impossible for even D (odd degree sum). Fix by allowing some S\u2013(ball\\S) adjacencies inside the ball and including those endpoints into S, then sealing all of S; or restrict to odd D in the regular case. The \u2264D case can still be handled by sealing S via edges to vertices inside the ball while ensuring all S vertices have global degree D in the ball.\n- Refinement monotonicity (P2 Prop. 2) is false in general. Replace with a cylinder\u2011rich hypothesis: every open neighborhood contains a local cylinder. Then the forcing works uniformly in such topologies.\n- Even\u2011regular case: do not rely on the abstract\u2019s Theorem 16 without proof. We provide a complete construction showing that \u201chas a 2\u2011way infinite bridge at distance \u2264k\u201d is nowhere dense for every k, hence the union is meagre. Combined with the parity lemma (no 1\u2011way bridges for even D), this yields that bridgeless is comeagre for even D under the local topology.\n\nWhat is solid now\n- A clean lemma: in any cylinder\u2011rich topology, once a property\u2019s complement can be forced by a cylinder refinement, that property is nowhere dense. The saturated\u2011bubble forcing is valid for \u2264D and =D (odd).\n- A full proof that 2\u2011way infinite bridges form a dense meagre set (hence not nowhere dense) for D>2 in both \u2264D and =D.\n\nNext steps\n- Formalize the cylinder\u2011rich/strongly\u2011local class; list standard metrics (weighted local, edit\u2011on\u2011balls, FO\u2011local) that belong to it and verify Baire/Polish status.\n- Explicitly construct D\u2011regular infinite completions realizing the refined ball in the odd\u2011regular forcing; include a short lemma ensuring existence.\n- Replace any use of refinement\u2011monotonicity by the cylinder\u2011rich argument. If exploring metrics that are not cylinder\u2011rich (end\u2011aware), first prove they are Baire/Polish, then analyze density of no\u20111\u2011edge\u2011cut constraints.\n",

For any realized r-ball F with r\u2265k, construct an extension H by attaching, to each boundary vertex v with deg_F(v)<D, a new vertex x_v at distance r+1 and then connecting the x_v along a single cycle via additional new vertices outside B_r. Choose the construction so that at least one new vertex (on the outside cycle) still has residual degree to allow an infinite continuation; this ensures nonemptiness of the refined cylinder.\n\nKey observations:\n- If, in F\u2212e, one side of an edge e at distance \u2264k contains no boundary vertex with residual degree, then in any completion within the cylinder C(F) that side cannot become infinite, so e can never be a 2-way infinite bridge.\n- Otherwise, pick boundary vertices v_A and v_B with residual degree on the two sides. In H there is a path from v_A to v_B outside B_r, so every such e lies on a cycle contained in B_{r+2}(H). Therefore, with F\u2032=B_{r+2}(H), the cylinder C(F\u2032) contains no graph from P_k.\nThus P_k is nowhere dense. Taking P=\u22c3_k P_k, we get that the set of graphs with a 2-way infinite bridge is meagre. The same construction shows P is dense by adding, in any cylinder, a far-away double ray connected by a single edge. For even D-regular graphs, any bridge is 2-way infinite; hence bridgeless is comeagre under the local topology.\n\nCylinder-rich (strongly local) topologies: A topology is cylinder\u2011rich if every open neighborhood around x contains a local cylinder C(B_r(x)). In any such topology, the sealed finite-component (\u201csaturated bubble\u201d) forcing shows bridgeless is nowhere dense in G_{\u2022,\u2264D} and in G_{\u2022,=D} for odd D. This covers many natural local metrics (weighted sums of r-ball disagreements, FO-local, edit-on-balls)."

    "content": "Theorem A (2-way infinite bridges are meagre and dense for D>2).\nLet X be either G_{\u2022,\u2264D} or G_{\u2022,=D} with D>2 under the local topology. For each k\u2208N, the set P_k of graphs that contain a 2-way infinite bridge at distance \u2264k from the root is nowhere dense. Hence P=\u22c3_{k} P_k is meagre. Moreover, P is dense in X.\n\nProof.\nFix k and a realized cylinder C(F) with F=B_r(G,\u03c1), r\u2265k. Let S be the set of boundary vertices v\u2208L_r(F) with deg_F(v)<D. If S=\u2205, then no completion from C(F) can produce a 2-way infinite bridge with both sides escaping beyond B_r, so P_k\u2229C(F)=\u2205 and we are done by taking F\u2032=F.\nAssume S\u2260\u2205. For each v\u2208S, add a new vertex x_v at distance r+1 adjacent to v. Next connect the set {x_v: v\u2208S} into a single simple cycle by inserting new vertices outside B_{r+1} as needed so that degrees of all new vertices stay \u2264D (this is always possible since D>2). Ensure at least one new vertex on this cycle retains residual degree (e.g., make one cycle node of degree 2), guaranteeing nonemptiness of the refined cylinder by allowing infinite continuation beyond radius r+2. Let H be the resulting extension and set F\u2032=B_{r+2}(H).\nConsider any edge e within distance \u2264k from the root. If in F\u2212e one side has no vertex from S, then in any completion from C(F) that side cannot be infinite (no boundary vertex there has residual capacity), so e cannot be a 2-way infinite bridge. Otherwise there exist v_A,v_B\u2208S on distinct sides of e. In H there is a path from v_A to v_B outside B_r via the cycle; concatenating with paths inside F from the endpoints of e to v_A and v_B (avoiding e) yields a cycle passing through e wholly contained in B_{r+2}(H). Therefore, for any completion with r+2-ball equal to F\u2032, e is not a bridge. It follows that C(F\u2032)\u2286C(F) and C(F\u2032)\u2229P_k=\u2205. Since C(F) was arbitrary, P_k is nowhere dense. As P=\u22c3_k P_k, P is meagre.\nFor density, let C(F) be any cylinder. Outside some large radius R\u226br, attach two disjoint infinite D\u2011bounded rays and connect them by a single edge e; then connect the core to exactly one ray by a long path. This yields an element of C(F) with a 2\u2011way infinite bridge e. Hence P is dense.\n\nLemma B (Parity obstruction in even\u2011regular graphs).\nIn a D\u2011regular infinite graph with even D, every bridge is 2\u2011way infinite.\nProof. If removing e leaves a finite component C, then \u2211_{v\u2208C}deg(v)=D|C| is even, while in G\u2212e it equals 2|E(C)|+1, a contradiction.\n\nCorollary C (Bridgeless is comeagre in even\u2011regular spaces).\nIn X=G_{\u2022,=D} with even D>2 under the local topology, the set of graphs with a bridge equals P (by Lemma B) and is meagre (Theorem A). Its complement (bridgeless) is therefore comeagre.\n\nTheorem D (Bridgeless is nowhere dense in cylinder\u2011rich topologies for \u2264D and odd\u2011regular).\nLet T be a cylinder\u2011rich topology on X. Then the set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense in G_{\u2022,\u2264D} for D\u22653 and in G_{\u2022,=D} for odd D\u22653.\nProof. Let U\u2208T be nonempty and x\u2208U. By cylinder\u2011richness, there is r with C(B_r(x))\u2286U. Build a finite sealed set S within some larger radius R so that: (i) all vertices of S have total degree D inside B_R, (ii) there is exactly one edge e between S and V(B_R)\\S, and (iii) there remains at least one vertex outside S with residual capacity to permit infinite completions (\u2264D) or a D\u2011regular completion (odd D). Then every graph in C(B_R(x)) contains the bridge e, hence U contains a nonempty open subset disjoint from the bridgeless set. Therefore bridgeless is nowhere dense in (X,T)."
