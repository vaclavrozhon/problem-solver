=== SYSTEM ===
You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md, proofs.md, and output.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers
- notes.md (informal progress & exploratory work so far)
- proofs.md (rigorous proofs & detailed mathematics so far)
- output.md (main results found so far)

**Three-tier file system guidelines**:
- **notes.md**: Readable, log of exploratory work, intuitions, failed attempts, ideas. Prefer appending. Replace only if old notes are clearly misleading. It should be self-contained: In particular, reading it should make sense without knowing the output of provers in past rounds. 

- **proofs.md**: Complete rigorous mathematical proofs with full details. Think twice before adding anything. Contains proven lemmas, theorems, and detailed derivations. Only add mathematically verified content here.
- **output.md**: This is the only file that the user is supposed to read in case your verdict is "promising". It has to be self-contained. It contains ONLY the main problem results, and a discussion why they are relevant. It is extremely selective. Think twice before promoting proofs from proofs.md to output.md. Only if the result marks clear progress on the problem, and only if the proof in proofs.md has been thoroughly vetted by provers and you, it can join output.md. Each result must be followed by a rigorous, self-contained proof that properly defines all objects of interest and is essentially publication-ready. 

Tasks:
1) Audit rigor: identify unjustified steps, false statements, missing lemmas; produce minimal counterexamples.
2) Triage value: separate genuine progress from noise.
3) Guide next steps: propose what provers should try next.

## Setting

- Fix an integer \(D \ge 2\).
- Let \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) be the space of **countably infinite, connected, rooted graphs** \((G,\rho)\).
- For \((G,\rho) \in \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) and \(r \in \mathbb{N}\), let \(B_r(G,\rho)\) denote the rooted (closed) ball of radius \(r\) about \(\rho\).
- Equip \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) with the **local (Benjamini–Schramm) metric** \(d_\bullet\) given by
  \[
  d_\bullet\big((G,\rho),(H,\sigma)\big)=2^{-R},
  \qquad
  R=\sup\{r\in\mathbb{N} : B_r(G,\rho)\cong B_r(H,\sigma)\}.
  \]
  (Equivalently, \(d_\bullet((G,\rho),(H,\sigma))<2^{-r}\) iff \(B_r(G,\rho)\cong B_r(H,\sigma)\).)
- Degree‑constrained subspaces:
  - \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\): all rooted graphs with \(\Delta(G)\le D\).
  - \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,= D}\): all rooted graphs with \(\Delta(G)= D\).
  We write \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for either of these when the distinction is unimportant.
- A subset \(S\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) is **nowhere dense** if the interior of \(\overline{S}\) is empty. A set is **meagre** (first category) if it is a countable union of nowhere dense sets; its complement is **comeagre**. A property is called **typical** if the corresponding set is comeagre.
- An edge \(e\) of an (unrooted) graph \(G\) is a **bridge** if \(G-e\) has more connected components than \(G\). A bridge is **2‑way infinite** if both components are infinite and **1‑way infinite** otherwise.

---
Prove or disprove:


## Conjecture — Metric sensitivity of typicality
There exists a **natural alternative metric** on the same underlying set \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for which the collection of **typical properties** differs from those under \(d_\bullet\). In particular, determine whether there is a reasonable metric in which **bridgeless graphs are typical**, or prove that no such metric can change their typicality.

# Research Notes



Working hypothesis: Robustness of bridge atypicality under tame topologies.

Definitions (to be formalized):
- A tame topology on X=G_{\bullet,D} has a countable base consisting of sets A(F,Π), where F is a rooted r-ball and Π is a finite boundary datum on a finite subset S of the boundary L_r(F). Π should specify: (i) residual degree budget at each v∈S (an integer in [0,D−deg_F(v)]), and (ii) finitely many local forbiddances of new adjacencies between specified boundary atoms; any completion must respect these.
- Basic cylinders C(F)=\{G: B_r(G)≅F\} are special cases A(F,∅). The topology is required to be generated by these A(F,Π), and the space should be Polish (hence Baire).

Goal: For all tame τ and for X=G_{\bullet,≤D} (D>2) and X=G_{\bullet,=D} with odd D, the bridgeless set is nowhere dense. For even D regular, bridgeless is already comeagre under d_• (1‑way bridges impossible; 2‑way bridges meagre), so no flip is needed.

Bridge‑forcing sketch (≤D):
- Given nonempty A(F,Π), extend F to a larger ball F′ by attaching a finite tree gadget T outside a buffered annulus so that exactly one edge e crosses from F‑side to T‑side, and saturate degrees of all vertices on both sides that could create additional outside connections. Ensure T is disjoint from S so Π is unaffected.
- In any completion respecting Π, degrees on the cut interface are saturated; hence no new outside edge can connect T to the rest, and e remains the unique cut‑edge, i.e., a bridge. Also leave ample unsaturated boundary elsewhere to admit infinite completions.

Odd D regular gadget: Replace the degree‑saturation by a D‑regular odd gadget ensuring a unique cut‑edge while keeping all degrees exactly D. To be written in full detail (parity bookkeeping, buffer, and compatibility with Π).

Planned verification checklists:
- Precisely define Π and show A(F,Π) form a base; prove nonemptiness criteria and that the space is Polish.
- Show common “finite‑coding” metrics (weighted sums of finitely many r‑ball tests) are tame.
- Write the bridge‑forcing lemma rigorously for ≤D and odd D regular.
- Explore whether logical/Stone topologies are tame; if not, test whether bridge‑forcing still yields nowhere denseness.


Agenda and corrections

- Robust bridge forcing: Attaching a leaf or a short pendant path does NOT force a bridge in all extensions, since extensions may add edges at the leaf. Correct forcing uses a finite D‑saturated bubble on one side: build a finite connected subgraph H whose vertices all have degree D (in \le D) or exactly D (in =D), except a designated vertex w with degree D−1 inside H; connect w to a boundary vertex u in the core by a single edge e=uw. Saturate all vertices of H (including w after adding e) to degree D within the prescribed ball, and do not add any other edges between H and the core. Then in every extension respecting the degree bound, no new edges can be added at H, so e remains the unique edge across the cut and is a bridge. The H side is finite; the other side can be extended to infinity via other boundary vertices.
- Cylinder‑rich topologies: We call a topology cylinder‑rich if for every open neighborhood U of x there exists r with the cylinder {y: B_r(y)≅B_r(x)} contained in U. This covers the local metric and many natural local metrics (weighted multi‑radius edit distances, etc.). In any cylinder‑rich topology, the above gadget yields a cylinder on which every graph has a bridge, so bridgeless sets are nowhere dense in G_{•,≤D} and in G_{•,=D} for odd D.
- Even D‑regular parity: In D‑regular graphs with even D, every bridge is 2‑way infinite; 1‑way infinite bridges are impossible by degree‑sum parity on a finite component.
- Nonlocal attempts: Adding a global boolean “has a bridge” coordinate makes that property open and cannot render “bridgeless” typical. An end‑sensitive topology may alter typicality but needs proof of metrizability/Baire property and density arguments to rule out 1‑edge cuts.

Open tasks
- Formalize the saturated‑bubble construction in regular (=D) odd case, including existence of infinite D‑regular extensions realizing the refined ball.
- Prove (or refute) that “has a 2‑way infinite bridge” is meagre in ≤D and =D; this would imply comeagre bridgeless for even D.
- Specify and study a natural nonlocal, Baire topology (e.g., end‑profile inverse limit) where bridgeless might be typical; verify all topological properties first.

# Main Results

Ideas
- We formalize a class of “strongly local” metrics d on X=G_{\bullet,D} (degree-bounded or D-regular) that dominate the Benjamini–Schramm metric d_\bullet in the sense: closeness in d forces agreement of a large finite r-ball around the root. This ensures any d-open ball is contained in some d_\bullet-cylinder C(F), and small enough d-balls are contained in finer cylinders C(F′).
- Within this class we give a general criterion: if the complement of a property P can be forced by a cylinder-refinement (i.e., from any cylinder one can refine to a smaller cylinder all of whose extensions lie in P^c), then P is nowhere dense under any such d. We then implement the bridge-forcing refinement in full detail for X=G_{\bullet,\le D} (all D≥3) and X=G_{\bullet,=D} with D odd, thereby establishing robustness of “bridgeless is nowhere dense.”
- For even D in the regular space, bridgeless is already comeagre under d_\bullet (since 1-way bridges are impossible and 2-way bridges are meagre), so no “flip” is needed.

Definitions
- Strongly local (dominating) metric. A metric d on X is strongly local if there is a modulus ψ:(0,1]→\mathbb{N} such that for all x,y∈X and ε∈(0,1],
  d(x,y)<ε ⇒ B_{ψ(ε)}(x)≅B_{ψ(ε)}(y).
  Equivalently, every d-ball U=B_d(x,ε) is contained in the cylinder C(B_{ψ(ε)}(x)).
- Basic cylinders. For an r-ball F, let C(F)={x∈X: B_r(x)≅F}.

Examples
- Weighted-sum local metrics: given weights (w_r)_{r≥0} strictly decreasing with w_r>0 and ∑_r w_r<∞, define
  d_w(x,y)=\sum_{r≥0} w_r·1_{B_r(x)\not\cong B_r(y)}.
  Then d_w is strongly local: if d_w(x,y)<w_R, there can be no mismatch at any radius ≤R, hence B_R(x)≅B_R(y). The topology is Polish (X embeds as a closed subset of a countable product of finite discrete sets; d_w induces the product topology).
- Any metric topologically finer than d_\bullet with the above modulus property is strongly local.

General lemma (robust nowhere-denseness under strongly local metrics)
Lemma 1. Let d be strongly local on X. Suppose S⊂X has the following forcing property: for every r-ball F with C(F)≠\varnothing, there exists r′≥r and an r′-ball F′ extending F such that C(F′)≠\varnothing and every x∈C(F′) lies in X\S. Then S is nowhere dense in (X,d).
Proof. Let U be a nonempty d-open set. Pick x∈U and ε>0 with B_d(x,ε)⊂U. Put r=ψ(ε); then B_d(x,ε)⊂C(B_r(x)). By assumption, there exists r′≥r and F′ extending B_r(x) with C(F′) nonempty and C(F′)⊂X\S. Choose y∈C(F′). For any 0<δ<1 with ψ(δ)≥r′, we have B_d(y,δ)⊂C(B_{r′}(y))=C(F′)⊂X\S. Hence U contains a nonempty d-open subset B_d(y,δ) disjoint from S. Therefore interior_d(\overline{S}^d)=\varnothing, i.e., S is nowhere dense.

Bridge forcing in X=G_{\bullet,\le D} (all D≥3)
We prove the forcing hypothesis of Lemma 1 with S=“bridgeless graphs.” Fix (G,\rho) and r, and put F=B_r(G,\rho). Let u∈L_r(F) be a boundary vertex with deg_F(u)<D (such a u exists since G is infinite and Δ(G)≤D). We build an r′-ball F′ extending F so that every extension of F′ contains a bridge. The key is to create a finite “sealed lump” T attached to u by a single edge e=ut_0, and to saturate all vertices of T to their maximum allowed degree D within F′, so that in any extension no new edges can be added incident to T; hence e is the only edge from T to the rest of the graph in every extension, and therefore a bridge.
Construction of T.
- Pick an odd integer n≥D+2, and create new vertices t_0,t_1,…,t_{n-1}. We will add edges among the t_i’s and connect u to t_0 by e.
- Target degrees inside F′:
  • For each i≥1, set deg_{F′}(t_i)=D.
  • Set deg_{F′}(t_0)=D, with one of these D edges being e=ut_0.
  • No vertex in T has any neighbor outside T∪{u} within F′.
- Thus inside the induced subgraph on T the degree sequence is (D-1,D,…,D) of length n: t_0 has D−1 neighbors in T, each t_i (i≥1) has D neighbors in T.
- Existence (Erdős–Gallai check). For D≥3 and odd n≥D+2, the nonincreasing sequence (D,…,D,D−1) is graphic. Indeed, its sum D(n−1)+(D−1)=Dn−1 is even when D and n are odd. For 1≤k≤n−1, with min(k,D) treated casewise,
  ∑_{i=1}^k d_i≤k(k−1)+(n−k)min(k,D)
  holds because for k≤D the RHS is kn−k≥Dk, and for k≥D+1,
  Dk≤k(k−1)+(n−k)D ⇔ 0≤k^2−(1+2D)k+nD,
  which is minimized at k=D+1, where it equals D(n−D−1)≥D>0 since n≥D+2. For k=n the inequality is trivial. Hence such a simple graph on T exists. Now add e=ut_0. This realizes the target degrees inside F′.
- Choose r′ large enough to contain T∪{u} and all its edges at distance ≤r′ from the root.
- Ensure nonemptiness (room to extend): choose a boundary vertex w∈L_r(F) with w≠u and leave deg_{F′}(w)<D (e.g., add nothing at w); then T is sealed, but w has residual capacity. Any infinite locally finite completion can be grown off w (e.g., by attaching a degree-≤D infinite tree beyond radius r′), ensuring C(F′)≠\varnothing.
Verification (bridge). In any extension of F′ within X, every vertex in T already has degree D in F′, so no further edges with an endpoint in T can be added. Within F′, the only edge between T and V(F′)\T is e=ut_0. Hence in any completion, e is the unique edge whose deletion separates the finite set T from the rest, so e is a 1‑way infinite bridge. Thus C(F′)⊂X\S, as required.
Remark on parity. The above construction crucially uses n odd (to pass the graphicity check). This covers all D≥3 by choosing n odd; there is no obstruction in the ≤D space because degrees inside T are exactly D and the unique cross-edge e is accounted for via the neighbor u∉T.

Bridge forcing in X=G_{\bullet,=D} for odd D≥3
We adapt the previous gadget, but must maintain exact D-regularity in the final graph. The same T works: inside F′, all vertices of T have degree D (counting e), and no further edges incident to T are allowed in any extension. The rest of F′ (including u) may have residual degree and will be completed outside F′. As before, e is the only edge between T and the rest in any completion; thus e is a 1‑way infinite bridge.
Nonemptiness: leave at least one vertex z in F′\T with deg_{F′}(z)<D to permit D-regular completion; as the outside is infinite, one can attach a D-regular infinite completion (e.g., graft a D-regular tree or any standard D-regular expander tail) to z and distribute the finitely many residual stubs in F′ in a finite neighborhood. Therefore C(F′)≠\varnothing.

Conclusion via Lemma 1
- For X=G_{\bullet,\le D} (D≥3) and X=G_{\bullet,=D} with D odd, the complement of “bridgeless” is forced by a cylinder refinement inside any cylinder. Hence “bridgeless” is nowhere dense under any strongly local metric d.
- If, additionally, (X,d) is Baire (e.g., Polish via product-coding as above), then “bridgeless” is meagre.

Even D-regular case
In D-regular graphs with even D, 1‑way infinite bridges are impossible (standard parity argument: if A is the finite side of a cut with a single edge, then |δ(A)|≡D|A| (mod 2), contradiction). The paper’s Theorem 16 shows graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge form a meagre set. Hence “bridgeless” is comeagre (typical) already under d_\bullet; the above robustness is not needed to obtain typicality.

Obstacles and clarifications
- Why the “single sealed lump” T suffices in ≤D for all D≥3: Although parity often obstructs “one cross edge” between a finite K and its complement when all degrees in K are pre-specified internally, our construction specifies degrees of T inside F′ counting the cross-edge e to u∉T. This removes the parity obstruction for all D by choosing n odd. The graphicity check above is the only nontrivial existence point, and it is satisfied.
- Necessity of strong locality: The proof of Lemma 1 uses that a d-ball is contained in a cylinder, and that smaller d-balls around a refined cylinder point are contained in the refining cylinder. Without this domination property, we cannot guarantee that open neighborhoods stay inside a cylinder that forces a bridge.

Next steps (for verifier)
1) Formalize “strongly local” precisely in the notes and record the general Lemma 1 with its short proof. Add the example class d_w.
2) Write a complete, self-contained proof of the graphicity claim: for odd n≥D+2, the degree sequence (D,…,D,D−1) is graphic (we gave a full Erdős–Gallai verification).
3) Package the forcing construction as a lemma: In X=G_{\bullet,\le D} (D≥3) and X=G_{\bullet,=D} with D odd, for any cylinder C(F) there exists a refinement C(F′) such that every extension contains a 1‑way infinite bridge, and C(F′)≠\varnothing.
4) Conclude: For any strongly local (Polish) metric d on X, “bridgeless” is nowhere dense (hence meagre), so typicality does not change within this natural class. For even D‑regular, “bridgeless” is already typical under d_\bullet.

Remarks on alternative, nonlocal metrics
- Adding global “bridge profile” coordinates (e.g., H_r indicating existence of a bridge meeting B_r) to define d_new=d_\bullet+\sum 2^{−r−1}|H_r(x)−H_r(y)| yields neighborhoods where the bridge set may have interior, and completeness/Baire-ness can fail (sequences that push bridges arbitrarily far out are Cauchy with no limit preserving profile). This suggests such metrics are not Baire-safe.

Summary
- We provided a rigorous invariance scheme for “bridgeless is nowhere dense” under a broad, natural class of strongly local (dominating) metrics, with explicit bridge-forcing gadgets and a fully verified graphicity step. This makes measurable, auditable progress toward a negative answer to the conjecture within a robust class of alternative metrics. Pending: a systematic catalogue of natural metrics satisfying strong locality, and an impossibility or construction result outside this class.


=== Prover 2 Output ===

Ideas
- Fix the target: show that for a broad, natural class of alternative metrics/topologies on X=G_{\bullet,D}, the typicality of “bridgeless” cannot flip relative to the local topology. In particular, any metric that is topologically equivalent to, or a refinement of, the local Benjamini–Schramm topology yields the same Baire category results.
- Provide rigorous, checkable lemmas: (i) topological invariance of Baire category; (ii) many “natural” alternatives (weighted local metrics, FO-local metrics) induce the same topology; (iii) a clean bridge-forcing construction in the odd-regular case (resolving feedback (4)); (iv) an explicit no-go for refinements (resolving (5)).
- Clarify the even-regular case: bridgeless is already comeagre under the local topology; hence no “flip” is needed (resolving (6)).

Topological invariance and natural alternatives

Proposition 1 (Baire invariance under topological equivalence). Let (X,\tau) be a Baire space and let d and d' be two metrics generating \tau. Then meagre/comeagre/nowhere-dense sets are identical for d and d'.
Proof. Category notions depend only on the topology.

Proposition 2 (monotonicity under refinement). If \tau' refines \tau on X and S\subseteq X is nowhere dense in \tau, then S is nowhere dense in \tau'.
Proof. \overline{S}^{\tau'}\subseteq\overline{S}^{\tau}. Hence int_{\tau'}\overline{S}^{\tau'}\subseteq int_{\tau}\overline{S}^{\tau}=\varnothing.

Lemma 3 (weighted local metrics induce the same topology). Fix positive weights (a_r)_{r\ge0} with \sum_r a_r<\infty and define
 d_a\big((G,\rho),(H,\sigma)\big)=\sum_{r\ge0} a_r\, \mathbf 1\{B_r(G,\rho)\not\cong B_r(H,\sigma)\}.
Then d_a and the standard ultrametric d_\bullet generate the same open sets on \mathbf G_{\bullet,D}.
Proof. If B_R match, then d_a\le \sum_{r>R} a_r. Conversely, if B_R do not match for all R\ge R_0, then d_a\ge\sum_{r\le R_0} a_r>0. Basic neighborhoods are exactly the cylinders \mathbf G_\bullet^{B_R}.

Remark 4 (FO-local metrics). If two rooted graphs agree on all first-order formulas of quantifier rank \le k, Gaifman locality implies they agree on all r-balls for r=O(2^k) in bounded degree. Hence any metric that declares closeness via FO-types of bounded rank generates the same topology as d_\bullet. Thus these “logical” local metrics do not change typicality outcomes.

Consequences
- Any “natural” metric obtained by reweighting or coding finitely many r-balls (including FO-local) is topologically equivalent to d_\bullet; hence typical properties coincide by Proposition 1.
- Any refinement of the local topology cannot make the bridgeless set typical in the regimes where it is nowhere dense under d_\bullet (Proposition 2).

Even-regular case (clean positive result)

Lemma 5 (no 1-way bridges for even-regular). In a D-regular graph with even D, an edge cannot be a 1-way infinite bridge.
Proof. If removing e leaves a finite component C, then \sum_{v\in C} \deg(v)=D|C| is even, but also equals 2|E(C)|+1 (exactly one edge leaves C), which is odd. Contradiction.

Theorem 6 (bridgeless is comeagre for even-regular). On \mathbf G_{\bullet,=D} with even D>2 under d_\bullet, the set of graphs with a 2-way infinite bridge is meagre (by Theorem 16 of the paper). By Lemma 5, “has a bridge” is equivalent to “has a 2-way infinite bridge,” hence the bridged set is meagre and its complement (bridgeless) is comeagre.

Therefore, in the even-regular subspace, there is no need for a new metric: bridgeless graphs are already typical.

Odd-regular bridge forcing (rigorous finite gadget)
We give a self-contained, local forcing that works in \mathbf G_{\bullet,=D} for odd D>2, addressing feedback (4). The aim is: given any nonempty cylinder \mathbf G_\bullet^F, produce a larger ball F' so that every D-regular extension contains a bridge. The construction yields a 1-way infinite bridge.

Gadget existence. Fix odd D=2t+1\ge3. Let R be any finite connected D-regular simple graph. Choose t disjoint edges E_0=\{u_i v_i: i=1,\dots,t\} whose deletion leaves R connected (e.g., choose a simple cycle and take every other edge). Form H by deleting E_0 and adding a new vertex z adjacent to all 2t endpoints of E_0. Then:
- Every vertex of R retains degree D (loses one neighbor, gains the neighbor z).
- z has degree 2t=D-1.
- H is finite, simple, connected.

Embedding and forcing. Given F=B_r(G,\rho), take an arbitrary boundary vertex b\in L_r(F). Extend F outward to radius r+3 as follows:
- Add a new path b\mbox{--}y\mbox{--}z of length 2, placing y at distance r+1 and z at distance r+2 from the root.
- Attach H at z by identifying its special vertex with z; include all of H within the (r+3)-ball. Inside this ball, every vertex of H\setminus\{z\} has degree D, and z currently has degree D-1 within H and becomes degree D after adding the edge yz.
- Do not add any other edges incident to vertices of H within the ball.
Call the resulting ball F'. Then for any D-regular extension (G',\rho') with B_{r+3}(G',\rho')\cong F', the edge yz is a bridge: removing yz disconnects the finite component S consisting of H\cup\{z\} from the rest of G'. Indeed, every vertex of S has degree D already inside S (z’s Dth edge is yz), so no extension can add further edges incident to S by the degree constraint; hence yz is the only edge leaving S, and yz is a 1-way infinite bridge.

Thus, for odd D, the set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense under any topology that contains the local cylinders as open sets (in particular, under d_\bullet).

No-go for refinements and for topologically equivalent metrics

Corollary 7. Let \tau be any topology on \mathbf G_{\bullet,\le D} or \mathbf G_{\bullet,=D} (odd D) that refines the local topology. Then the bridgeless set is nowhere dense in (\mathbf G_{\bullet,D},\tau).
Proof. It is nowhere dense under d_\bullet by the forcing above (odd-regular) and by the arguments in the paper (degree-bounded). Apply Proposition 2.

Corollary 8. Any metric on \mathbf G_{\bullet,D} yielding the same topology as d_\bullet (e.g., any weighted-local or FO-local metric) preserves typicality of all properties, in particular of “bridgeless.”

Examples and checks
- For D=3, an explicit H is obtained by taking any 3-regular graph R and deleting a perfect matching of size 1 (one edge) is insufficient; instead delete t=1 edge u_1v_1 and attach z adjacent to u_1 and v_1. This yields deg(z)=2=D-1, all other degrees 3. The path b–y–z and the block H saturate S, forcing yz as a bridge in any 3-regular extension.
- For degree-bounded spaces \mathbf G_{\bullet,\le D}, the same odd-D gadget forces a 1-way bridge. For even D, this particular 1-way bridge forcing fails in \mathbf G_{\bullet,=D} by Lemma 5, but remains valid in \mathbf G_{\bullet,\le D} (since an infinite extension exists that keeps degrees \le D while leaving S sealed), thereby matching the statement “bridgeless is nowhere dense in \mathbf G_{\bullet,\le D} for all D>2.”

Caveat and obstacle (clarifying scope)
- The 1-way bridge forcing by sealing a finite component S relies on the degree constraint to prevent any new edges out of S in extensions; hence it works in \le D and in odd-regular, but is impossible in even-regular by Lemma 5. For forcing a 2-way infinite bridge purely locally, extra care is needed because an extension may add a path entirely outside the ball connecting the two sides; local sealing cannot forbid such a path. This explains why Theorem 16 only proves meagreness (not nowhere-denseness) of the 2-way bridge set.

Consequences for the conjecture
- There is no “natural” alternative metric among the usual local/coding/logical metrics that changes typicality: they are topologically equivalent to the Benjamini–Schramm metric; typicality is a topological notion.
- No refinement of the local topology can make bridgeless typical in \mathbf G_{\bullet,\le D} (D>2) or in \mathbf G_{\bullet,=D} for odd D: the bridgeless set is nowhere dense in the local topology and remains so in any refinement.
- In \mathbf G_{\bullet,=D} with even D, bridgeless graphs are already comeagre under d_\bullet.

Next steps
- Formalize the general “no-go class”: topologies whose basic opens contain (or are unions of) local cylinders. Prove rigorously that in \mathbf G_{\bullet,\le D} (D>2) bridgeless is nowhere dense under any such topology by a uniform sealing argument, and that in \mathbf G_{\bullet,=D} (odd D) the odd-regular gadget above suffices.
- Catalogue alternative metrics in the literature and verify they are topologically equivalent to, or refinements of, the local topology (weighted locals, FO-locals). This will close the “natural alternative” front in the negative for the hard regimes.
- If one seeks a genuine change in typical properties, one must consider topologies strictly coarser than local (e.g., end-sensitive tail topologies). Determine whether these are Baire and whether they make “bridgeless” comeagre. This remains open; care is needed to avoid trivial or non-Polish constructions.

Summary
- We proved that within a large class of natural alternatives (topologically equivalent or finer than local), typicality does not change. Weighted local and FO-local metrics fall here. Bridgeless is nowhere dense in \mathbf G_{\bullet,\le D} (D>2) and in \mathbf G_{\bullet,=D} for odd D; in even-regular it is already comeagre. We supplied an explicit odd-regular forcing gadget that seals a finite component, making a 1-way infinite bridge unavoidable in any extension. The only plausible route to different typical behavior is via coarser, genuinely nonlocal topologies; their Baire nature and impact on bridges remain to be established.

Ideas and scope
- Goal: audit and strengthen the current writeup around bridges and typicality, and clarify which parts are topological (metric‑independent under suitable equivalence) versus those sensitive to topology changes. I focus on (i) correcting foundational lemmas (closure issues), (ii) making the bridge‑forcing arguments robust, especially under degree constraints, (iii) giving a rigorous, local proof that “2‑way infinite bridges” form a dense meagre set, and (iv) delineating a broad class of “natural” metrics/topologies for which bridgeless graphs remain atypical.

Foundational corrections (local topology facts)
- Cylinders are clopen. For any realized r‑ball F, the cylinder G_•^F = {(G,ρ): B_r(G,ρ) ≅ F} is open by definition, and closed because if B_r(x_n) ≅ F for all n and x_n → x in d_•, then for each s ≤ r we eventually have B_s(x_n) ≅ B_s(x), hence B_r(x) ≅ F. This implies a practical criterion: S ⊂ G_• is nowhere dense if and only if for every realized r‑ball F there exists a realized r′‑ball F′ with G_•^{F′} ⊆ G_•^{F} and G_•^{F′} ∩ S = ∅. The current Lemma 13 should be corrected to use closure (or be restricted to clopen bases, where closure equals the set itself).
- Nonemptiness of cylinders in G_{•,≤D}. If F is a realized r‑ball in G_{•,≤D}, then some boundary vertex v ∈ L_r(F) has deg_F(v) < D; otherwise no outside neighbor can be added and the graph cannot be infinite. The text currently states a sufficient condition (“contains a vertex of degree < D at distance r”); for realized balls it is necessary and sufficient.

Rigorous bridge forcing in ≤ D (all D ≥ 2)
Lemma (saturated bubble, ≤ D). Fix D ≥ 2. For any realized r‑ball F and any boundary vertex u ∈ L_r(F) with deg_F(u) ≤ D − 1, there exist R > r and a realized R‑ball F′ extending F such that for every (G,ρ) ∈ G_{•,≤D}^{F′} the graph G has a 1‑way infinite bridge e incident with u.
Proof. Construct a finite “bubble” H disjoint from B_r(F) with a designated vertex w. Add a single new edge e = uw. Inside H, add edges and new vertices (all beyond radius r) so that:
- Every vertex of H except w has degree exactly D within the induced subgraph on B_R(G,ρ) (so no spare stubs remain inside the radius R), and w has degree D − 1 inside H; after adding e, w also has degree D within B_R.
- No vertex of H lies at distance R from ρ; equivalently, all vertices of H have their full degree D within the ball, so in any extension with the same R‑ball they cannot receive edges from outside without changing B_R.
Then in any extension with B_R = F′, there is exactly one edge across the cut between H and the rest, namely e; therefore e is a bridge. The H‑side is finite. To ensure G_{•,≤D}^{F′} is nonempty, leave at least one vertex on the boundary L_R(F′) with residual degree (< D) so that infinite completions exist. QED.
Remarks. The pendant‑leaf construction used in the current text is not robust: in extensions, new edges could attach to the “leaf” and destroy bridgeness. Saturating all vertices on the bubble‑side within the fixed ball remedies this.

Odd D regular: forcing a bridge in G_{•,=D}
Lemma (saturated bubble, = D, odd D ≥ 3). Let D be odd. For any realized r‑ball F in G_{•,=D} and any u ∈ L_r(F), there exist R and a realized R‑ball F′ extending F such that every (G,ρ) ∈ G_{•,=D}^{F′} has a 1‑way infinite bridge.
Proof idea. As above, build a finite bubble H and place all its vertices at radius < R. Ensure that in F′ every vertex of H has total degree D within B_R after adding e = uw; hence no bubble‑side vertex can receive edges from outside in any extension with the same R‑ball. On the core‑side, do not saturate all boundary vertices, so there are D‑regular infinite completions. Because D is odd, parity does not forbid 1‑way bridges. Existence of D‑regular infinite completions can be ensured explicitly by attaching an infinite D‑regular tree outside along the remaining boundary stubs. The quantifiers must be written carefully exactly as in the ≤ D case; the key is that all bubble‑side degrees equal D already within the radius R.
Parity obstruction for even D: in a D‑regular graph with even D, 1‑way infinite bridges do not exist (degree‑sum parity on the finite side). Thus Theorem 14(ii) cannot extend to even D.

Meagreness of 2‑way infinite bridges (Theorem 16): full proof plan
Fix D > 2 and work in either G_{•,≤D} or G_{•,=D}.
Step 1 (nowhere dense at fixed distance). For k ∈ N, let P_k be the set “there exists a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance ≤ k from the root.” I claim P_k is nowhere dense.
- Let G_{•}^F be any realized cylinder. Consider the finite set E_k of edges of F at distance ≤ k from the root. Partition E_k into two classes: “safe” edges for which at least one side of B_r(F) − e has no boundary vertex in L_r(F) with residual degree (< D); and “critical” edges otherwise. For a safe edge e, in any extension within G_{•}^F, at least one side cannot become infinite (only boundary vertices can acquire outside neighbors), hence e cannot be a 2‑way infinite bridge in any such extension.
- For the set S of boundary vertices with residual degree, attach (outside the radius r) one new neighbor x_v to each v ∈ S and then connect the x_v’s into a single external cycle using new edges and vertices. This modification yields an extension H of F. For any critical e, there is at least one v_A ∈ S on one side of e and one v_B ∈ S on the other; inside F there are paths from each endpoint of e to v_A and v_B, respectively, not using e. In H, the external cycle then gives a path from v_A to v_B outside F, so e lies on a cycle inside some bounded radius R (e.g., R = r + 2), hence e is not a bridge in any completion that fixes B_R(H).
- Let F′ = B_R(H). Then G_{•}^{F′} ⊆ G_{•}^F and G_{•}^{F′} ∩ P_k = ∅, proving P_k is nowhere dense.
Step 2 (meagreness). The set P of graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge equals ⋃_{k∈N} P_k and is thus meagre.
Step 3 (not nowhere dense; density). P is dense: from any cylinder G_{•}^F, choose a boundary vertex u with deg_F(u) < D and extend far outside to attach two disjoint infinite D‑bounded trees T_1, T_2 that are connected by a single edge e. Connect the core to exactly one of T_i by a long path disjoint from everything else. Then e is a 2‑way infinite bridge. By choosing the attachments beyond some radius R, we obtain a subcylinder G_{•}^{B_R} ⊆ G_{•}^F containing such graphs, and further refinements cannot destroy the already present 2‑way infinite bridge. Hence the closure of P has nonempty interior (indeed, P is dense meagre).
Consequences. In G_{•,=D} with even D, bridges are necessarily 2‑way infinite; therefore “has a bridge” is meagre, and the complement “bridgeless” is comeagre in the standard local topology. This complements Theorem 14 and should be recorded explicitly.

Critique and corrections for Theorem 14 and 15
- Theorem 14(i) (≤ D): Replace the pendant‑leaf argument with the saturated bubble lemma above. It yields, for every realized cylinder, a subcylinder all of whose members have a bridge, hence the bridgeless set is nowhere dense.
- Theorem 14(ii) (= D, odd D): Same correction via the D‑regular bubble. Parity prohibits 1‑way bridges for even D, explaining the exception.
- Theorem 15 (no cut vertex nowhere dense): For even D‑regular, provide an explicit local gadget that forces a cut vertex while keeping degrees D within the ball (e.g., two D‑regular “blobs” that only meet at a vertex v within the ball, with all degrees saturated there). Spell out: placement inside a clopen cylinder, degree saturation, and existence of D‑regular infinite completions along other boundary stubs. For ≤ D or odd D, this follows from the bridge‑forcing constructions (a bridge implies a cut vertex), but write this implication and the quantifiers explicitly.

Critique of Theorem 17 (edge‑chromatic number)
- The parity remark “removing an edge preserves χ′ = D+1” is false in general (e.g., K_3). To make χ′ = D + 1 nowhere dense, you need a finite class‑II forcer H_D: a finite D‑bounded graph such that any supergraph containing H_D as an induced subgraph satisfies χ′ ≥ D + 1. Candidates: for D odd, odd‑order D‑regular graphs; for D even, use Goldberg–Seymour or explicit overfull subgraphs. Then argue you can implant H_D inside any realized cylinder by attaching it outside the current radius and saturating degrees on the H_D side within the ball to block recoloring via outside edges. This needs a proper lemma; as written, Theorem 17 lacks a valid proof.

Topological sensitivity of typicality: what can and cannot change
- Nonmonotonicity caveat. Typicality (comeagreness) and nowhere denseness are not preserved under arbitrary topological refinements/coarsenings. Thus the monotonicity claims need to be removed. Any invariance statement must be proved for a specific class of topologies.
- Cylinder‑open topologies. Let τ be any topology on G_{•,D} that contains the local topology (equivalently, all local cylinders are τ‑open). Then the bridge‑forcing lemmas imply: for ≤ D and for = D with odd D, the set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense in τ as well (because every τ‑open set contains a local cylinder, which contains a subcylinder of all graphs with a bridge). Hence no such “natural refinement” makes bridgeless typical in these spaces.
- Even D‑regular: under the local topology, bridgeless is comeagre (using the 2‑way bridge meagreness above). Thus no metric change is needed to make bridgeless typical in this subspace.
- Coarser “natural” topologies: To flip typicality in ≤ D or odd D, one would need a coarser topology where the complement of the bridgeless set is meagre. But many natural coarsenings (e.g., quotienting by ends, or merging large annuli) still have cylinders as open sets or at least have an open base refining cylinders; for such topologies the forcing argument persists. A precise negative result could be proved for any “cylinder‑based” topology: a topology whose base consists of sets determined by finitely many local constraints around the root. Formalizing this (your “tame/cylinder‑rich” notions) and proving the invariance there would largely settle the conjecture negatively for a broad class of reasonable metrics.

Examples and sanity checks
- D = 3, = D: The D‑regular bubble can be built from small cubic graphs (e.g., a theta‑gadget) with a designated vertex w of degree 2 before adding e; after adding e all internal degrees are 3. The proof should exhibit one explicit gadget and its placement for clarity.
- D = 4, even regular: Bridgeless is comeagre. Exhibit that “has a 2‑way bridge at distance ≤ k” is nowhere dense via the boundary cycle construction; the parity lemma blocks 1‑way bridges.

Next steps (auditable work items)
1) Fix Lemma 13: state the clopen cylinder fact and the nowhere dense characterization via subcylinders; remove uses that ignore closure in nonclopen contexts.
2) Replace all bridge forcing with the saturated bubble lemmas; add full quantifiers and the R‑ball closure argument. Provide one explicit H for odd D (e.g., a finite D‑regular layered gadget with a designated attachment vertex).
3) Write out the proof of Theorem 16 fully as above (Step 1–3), explicitly handling degree constraints and the “critical edge” reduction using the single external cycle connecting all residual boundary vertices.
4) Record the corollary: In = D with even D, bridgeless is comeagre in the local topology.
5) For Theorem 17, either supply a standard finite class‑II forcer with a correct embedding argument or downgrade the claim to an open problem.
6) Formalize and prove an invariance theorem for a broad class of “cylinder‑open” topologies: if τ contains the local topology, then bridgeless is still nowhere dense in ≤ D and odd D regular.

Conclusion
- With the above corrections and proofs, the core typicality results become rigorous: bridgeless is nowhere dense in ≤ D and in = D for odd D (under any topology containing the local cylinders), while in = D with even D it is already comeagre under the local metric. This significantly narrows the search space for alternative “natural” metrics that could change typicality, and suggests that a negative answer to the conjecture may hold across a broad finitary class of topologies. The key remaining technical piece (now supplied) is the meagreness of 2‑way bridges and the robust bridge‑forcing gadgets under degree constraints.

### Typical properties of countable graphs: flows and bridges  
*(Extended abstract)*  

**Robert Šámal**\* · **Hadi Zamani**\*

#### Abstract
We have two aims. **First**, we study nowhere‑zero flows in countably infinite graphs, observing the different roles of two types of bridges. **Second**, we study how typical graphs with these types of bridges are. As there is no natural probability measure to use, we turn to an analytic approach: we study which sets are nowhere dense and which are meagre.

In finite graphs, bridges play a crucial role—it is easy to see that every flow assigns value \(0\) to every bridge. It is also known that graphs with a bridge are not typical: both dense random graphs and random regular graphs are bridgeless w.h.p. [3, 1]. We ask how this transfers to countable graphs. In Section 1 we explain differences between bridges and flows and, via compactness, we prove a version of Seymour’s 6‑flow theorem for countable graphs.

In Section 2 we explore nowhere‑dense and meagre sets. This is called for because the usual probabilistic models collapse: extending Erdős–Rényi to countably infinite graphs yields the Rado graph a.s., so we are effectively studying a single graph up to isomorphism. Attempting random regular graphs via the configuration model [1] would require a uniform distribution on perfect matchings of a countable set (e.g., neighbors of the first vertex), which does not exist. Consequently, we turn to Baire category: meagre/co‑meagre sets (also “first/second category”).

### 1. Nowhere‑zero flows for infinite graphs

**Definition 1 (weak flow).**  
Given an orientation \(D\) of a graph \(G\) and an abelian group \(A\), a **weak \(A\)‑flow** is a function \(\varphi:E(G)\to A\) such that **Kirchhoff’s law for each vertex cut** holds:
\[
\forall v\in V(G):\quad \sum_{e\in \delta^-(v)}\varphi(e)=\sum_{e\in \delta^+(v)}\varphi(e).
\]

**Definition 2 (strong flow).**  
Given \(D,G,A\) as above, a **strong \(A\)‑flow** is a function \(\varphi:E(G)\to A\) such that **Kirchhoff’s law for each cut** holds:
\[
\forall S\subseteq V(G):\quad \sum_{e\in \delta^+(S)}\varphi(e)=\sum_{e\in \delta^-(S)}\varphi(e).
\]

In either case, \(\varphi\) is a **nowhere‑zero** weak/strong \(A\)‑flow if \(\varphi^{-1}(0)=\varnothing\).

**Definition 3 (bridge).**  
An edge \(e\) of \(G\) is a **bridge** if deleting \(e\) increases the number of connected components. A bridge is **2‑way infinite** if both resulting components are infinite, and **1‑way infinite** otherwise.

Every strong flow is a weak flow. While the two notions are equivalent on finite graphs, they diverge on infinite graphs: e.g., on a two‑way infinite path, a nowhere‑zero weak \(A\)‑flow exists but a strong one does not. In [6] the authors construct a 3‑connected graph with two ends that admits a nowhere‑zero weak \(A\)‑flow but no nowhere‑zero strong \(A\)‑flow. Nearly all finite flow theorems extend to infinite **strong** \(A\)‑flows via topological compactness; here we use **logical** compactness to obtain:

**Theorem 4.**  
*A countably infinite, locally finite graph without a 1‑way infinite bridge has a nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow.*

### 2. Metric space of rooted connected graphs

Since no good probability measure exists for countable graphs, we study typicality via a metric topology and Baire category.

**Definition 5 (ε‑neighborhood).**  
For a metric space \((X,d)\) and \(x\in X\), the ε‑neighborhood is \(U_\varepsilon(x)=\{y\in X:\ d(x,y)<\varepsilon\}\). The closed neighborhood \(\overline{U}_\varepsilon(x)\) uses \(d(x,y)\le \varepsilon\).

**Definition 6 (open set).**  
A set \(U\subseteq X\) is open if \(\forall x\in U\ \exists \varepsilon>0:\ U_\varepsilon(x)\subseteq U\).

We now fix the graph space and metric.

**Definition 9 (space of rooted graphs).**  
Let \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) be the set of all connected rooted graphs (up to root‑preserving isomorphism). For \(D>2\), let \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) be those with all degrees \(\le D\), and \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) those with all degrees \(=D\).

**Definition 10 (r‑ball).**  
For \((G,v)\), the rooted r‑ball is
\[
B_r(G,v)=(\,G[\{y\in V(G): d(v,y)\le r\}],\,v\,).
\]

**Definition 11 (metric \(d_\bullet\)).**  
For \((G_1,v_1),(G_2,v_2)\in\mathbf{G}_\bullet\),
\[
d_\bullet\big((G_1,v_1),(G_2,v_2)\big)=\inf\{2^{-r} : B_r(G_1,v_1)\cong B_r(G_2,v_2)\}.
\]
This is a metric [5].

**Definition 12 (extensions of an r‑ball).**  
For an r‑ball \(F=B_r(G,v)\), define
\[
\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F=\{(G',v')\in \mathbf{G}_\bullet : B_r(G',v')\cong F\}.
\]

**Lemma 13 (basic facts in \((\mathbf{G}_\bullet,d_\bullet)\)).**  
- For each \((G,x)\), \(r\in\mathbb{N}\), and \(0<\varepsilon<1\):
  \[
  U_{2^{-r}+\varepsilon}((G,x))=U_{2^{-r}}((G,x))=\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{B_r(G,x)}.
  \]
- \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F\) is nonempty if \(F\) is an r‑ball in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) that contains a vertex of degree \< \(D\) at distance \(r\) from the root.
- A subset \(S\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) is nowhere dense iff
  \(\forall\) r‑balls \(F\ \exists\) r′‑ball \(F'\) with \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F'}\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F}\setminus S\).
- For all \(D>2\), \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) is not meagre.

### Main results on typical properties

**Theorem 14.**  
*The set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense (i) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) for all \(D>2\); and (ii) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) for all odd \(D>2\).*  
In D‑regular graphs with even \(D\), 1‑way infinite bridges cannot exist; instead we obtain:

**Theorem 15.**  
*The set of graphs without a cut vertex is nowhere dense in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

**Theorem 16.**  
*The set of graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge is meagre (but not nowhere dense) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

We also considered other (a)typical properties:

**Theorem 17.**  
*The set of graphs with edge‑chromatic number \(D\) is nowhere dense in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

### 3. Proof sketches

**Proof of Theorem 4 (sketch).**  
Let the vertices of \(G\) be \(v_1,v_2,\ldots\) and orient each edge \(\{v_i,v_j\}\) from the smaller to the larger index. For each radius \(r\), augment the r‑ball \(B_r(G,v_1)\) to a finite multigraph \(G_r\) by adding a sink vertex \(v_\infty\) and connecting boundary edges to \(v_\infty\). Introduce Boolean variables \(F_{e,1},\dots,F_{e,6}\) encoding which of six nonzero values an edge \(e\) receives, enforce exclusivity \(\bigvee_i F_{e,i}\) and \(\bigwedge_{j\ne i}\neg F_{e,j}\), and write linear parity constraints at each vertex (Kirchhoff’s law). Let \(F_{G_r}\) be the conjunction over vertices of \(G_r\); then every finite subset of the constraint family \(\{F_{G_r}\}_r\cup\{F_{e,i}\}_e\) is satisfiable (by [7]), hence by compactness [4] the whole set is satisfiable, yielding a nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow on \(G\).

**Proof idea for Theorem 14.**  
Given an r‑ball \(F\), construct an r′‑ball \(F'\) such that every extension of \(F'\) contains a bridge. For \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\), attach a leaf to a boundary vertex of degree \<\(D\). For \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) handle regularity via parity gadgets: define \(S(F)=\sum_{v\in L_r}(D-\deg v)\) where \(L_r\) is the boundary; use \(K_{D+1}-e\) gadgets and tree‑like expansions to force parity \(S(F)=1\), then attach a new vertex to create a bridge. Hence the bridgeless set is nowhere dense.

**Proof idea for Theorem 15.**  
In even \(D\)‑regular graphs, use gadgets to force a cut vertex; in odd \(D\) or degree‑bounded spaces, this also follows from the previous construction.

**Proof idea for Theorem 16.**  
Being “there is a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance \(k\)” is nowhere dense; take a union over \(k\in\mathbb{N}\) to get a meagre (but not nowhere‑dense) set.

**Proof idea for Theorem 17.**  
For each \(D\), there exist \(D\)‑regular graphs with \(\chi'(G)=D+1\) (even \(D\): complete graphs or any odd‑order \(D\)‑regular graph; odd \(D\): by Tutte’s theorem). Removing an edge preserves \(\chi'=D+1\) by parity. Embed parity gadgets within r‑balls so that every extension has edge‑chromatic number \(D+1\), hence the set is nowhere dense.

---

### 4. Future work (the conjectures)

**Question 18.** *Is the fact that a property is nowhere dense or meagre independent of the root?*  
A change of root gives one type of change of metric; however, many metrics on the space of countable graphs are possible.

**Question 19.** *Is there another metric on \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) where typical properties are different?*  
For instance, is there a metric in which **bridgeless graphs are typical**?

We also aim to investigate additional (a)typical properties in the spirit of Theorem 17.
