Replaced invalid leaf forcing by a sealed finite “saturated bubble” that forces a bridge in every completion. Proved: in any cylinder‑rich (strongly local) metric/topology, bridgeless graphs are nowhere dense in G_{•,≤D} and in G_{•,=D} for odd D. Supplied a full proof that “2‑way infinite bridges” form a dense meagre set for D>2; with the even‑regular parity lemma, this implies bridgeless is comeagre for even D under the standard metric. Flagged the false monotonicity claim under refinement; invariance should be stated for cylinder‑rich topologies. Next: formalize the metric class, ensure Baire/Polish properties, and add explicit completion lemmas for the regular case.
