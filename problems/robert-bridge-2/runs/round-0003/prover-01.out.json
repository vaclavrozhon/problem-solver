The \u201csealed bubble via degree saturation\u201d forcing works as stated for odd D, but it cannot work for even D in the \u2264D space: if a finite set T is sealed by saturating every v\u2208T to degG(v)=D and the only cross-edge to V(G)\\T is a single edge e, then 2|E(T)|=\u2211v\u2208T degG(v)\u2212|\u2202T|=D|T|\u22121, which is impossible when D is even (LHS is even). Hence, for even D one cannot force a 1-edge cut by saturating a finite side in \u2264D using only degree bounds. This invalidates the \u201cleaf\u201d forcing and shows the degree\u2011saturation bridge forcing must be confined to odd D (or to richer topologies that can encode forbid\u2011adjacency constraints).\n- Robustness class. We adopt strongly local metrics d on X=G_{\\bullet,D}: there is \u03c8:(0,1]\u2192\\mathbb{N} with d(x,y)<\u03b5 \u21d2 B_{\u03c8(\u03b5)}(x)\u2245B_{\u03c8(\u03b5)}(y). Weighted local metrics d_w(x,y)=\u2211_r w_r\u00b71_{B_r(x)\\not\\cong B_r(y)} (w_r\u21980, \u2211w_r<\u221e) are strongly local and Polish.\n\nLemma 1 (robust nowhere-denseness under strongly local metrics)\nLet d be strongly local on X and S\u2282X satisfy: for every finite r-ball F with C(F)\u2260\u2205 there exists an extension r\u2032-ball F\u2032 extending F with C(F\u2032)\u2260\u2205 and C(F\u2032)\u2286X\\S. Then S is nowhere dense in (X,d).\nProof. Let U be a nonempty d-open set, pick x\u2208U and \u03b5>0 with B_d(x,\u03b5)\u2282U. Put r=\u03c8(\u03b5). Then B_d(x,\u03b5)\u2282C(B_r(x)). By hypothesis, pick r\u2032\u2265r and F\u2032 extending B_r(x) with C(F\u2032) nonempty and C(F\u2032)\u2286X\\S. Choose y\u2208C(F\u2032). Take \u03b4>0 with \u03c8(\u03b4)\u2265r\u2032. Then B_d(y,\u03b4)\u2282C(F\u2032)\u2282X\\S. Hence every nonempty d-open set contains a nonempty d-open subset disjoint from S; equivalently, int_d(\\overline{S}^d)=\u2205.\n\nForcing a bridge for odd D (\u2264D and =D)\nWe implement the hypothesis of Lemma 1 with S=\u201cbridgeless graphs\u201d when D is odd.\n\nLemma 2 (odd D sealed bubble). Let D\u22653 be odd. There exists n\u2265D+2 (odd) such that the graphic degree sequence (D\u22121,D,D,\u2026,D) of length n can be realized by a connected simple graph T. Pick any boundary vertex u in a cylinder C(F) with deg_F(u)<D. Let F\u2032 be obtained by adjoining a disjoint copy of T and a single edge e=ut_0, where t_0 is the unique vertex of degree D\u22121 in T. Then every extension of F\u2032 in X=G_{\\bullet,\u2264D} or X=G_{\\bullet,=D} (odd D) contains e as a 1\u2011way infinite bridge.\nProof (existence of T). Fix any odd n\u2265D+2 and consider d=(D,\u2026,D,D\u22121) with n terms. Erd\u0151s\u2013Gallai inequalities hold:\n- Sum parity: \u2211 d_i=Dn\u22121 is even since D and n are odd.\n- For 1\u2264k\u2264n\u22121, write \u2211_{i=1}^k d_i = Dk (except when k=n, trivial). EG requires Dk \u2264 k(k\u22121)+\u2211_{i=k+1}^n min(D,k) = k(k\u22121)+(n\u2212k)min(D,k). If k\u2264D this is Dk \u2264 k(k\u22121)+(n\u2212k)k = kn\u2212k, i.e. D \u2264 n\u22121, true as n\u2265D+2. If k\u2265D+1 then min(D,k)=D and the inequality reduces to 0 \u2264 k^2 \u2212 (1+2D)k + nD, which is minimized at k=D+1 with value D(n\u2212D\u22121) \u2265 D > 0 (since n\u2265D+2). Thus d is graphic. Connectivity can be enforced by a standard edge\u2011switch: if the realized graph is disconnected, pick edges ab, cd from two components and replace them by ac, bd (avoiding parallel edges), which preserves degrees and decreases the component count; iterate.\nSealing and the bridge. In F\u2032, every vertex of T has degree D (counting e at t_0), hence in any extension in \u2264D or =D (odd) no additional edges incident to T can be added. The only edge between T and its complement is e; thus deleting e separates T (finite) from the rest (infinite), so e is a 1\u2011way infinite bridge in every extension.\nNonemptiness of C(F\u2032). Leave at least one boundary vertex w\u2208B_r(F) outside u with residual capacity; attach any infinite locally finite tail (\u2264D) or a D\u2011regular tail (=D odd) beyond the radius to realize an infinite extension. A standard completion is to graft a rooted (D\u22121)\u2011ary tree to each residual stub and then locally cap degrees to D by finite patching; details are routine and can be done disjointly from T.\n\nCorollary 3 (odd D robustness). For D odd \u22653, in both X=G_{\\bullet,\u2264D} and X=G_{\\bullet,=D}, the bridgeless set is nowhere dense (hence meagre) under any strongly local metric. By Lemma 1 and Lemma 2.\n\nEven D: obstruction and what remains true\n- Obstruction (formal). Let D be even and let K be any finite vertex set all of whose vertices have degree D in the final graph. Then |\u2202K| \u2261 D|K| (mod 2) is even. Hence a sealed bubble with a unique cross-edge cannot exist for even D. In particular, the degree\u2011saturation bridge forcing cannot work in \u2264D for even D (and of course not in =D).\n- Consequences. To force a bridge uniformly inside a cylinder without using additional constraints (like forbid\u2011adjacency), one needs a sealed finite side with a single cross-edge. The parity lemma rules this out for even D, so a different idea is required. This explains why the naive \u201cattach a leaf\u201d sketch is invalid for forcing and why a degree\u2011saturated gadget must fail for even D.\n- What is still robust. For every fixed k, the set S_k = {graphs having a 2\u2011way infinite bridge meeting B_k} is nowhere dense under any strongly local metric: inside any cylinder, augment near radius \u2248k by adding a short cycle through each edge within distance \u2264k (when a boundary vertex has residual capacity, add one new neighbor and connect these new neighbors into a cycle just outside the radius), thereby ensuring all such edges lie on cycles in every extension. Hence S_2way = \u22c3_{k\u22650} S_k is meagre (and dense). In =D with even D, 1\u2011way bridges are impossible by parity, so bridgeless graphs are comeagre already under d_\\bullet and remain so under any strongly local metric.\n\nTypicality versus metric changes\n- Negative result (within strongly local metrics). The meagreness of \u201cbridgeless\u201d is invariant in X=G_{\\bullet,\u2264D} and X=G_{\\bullet,=D} for odd D, and \u201cbridgeless\u201d is comeagre for even D in =D; strongly local alternative metrics (weighted multi\u2011radius, FO\u2011local, decorated local signatures) do not alter this.\n- Nonlocal attempts. Metrics augmented with global bridge profiles H_r or end\u2011data render the \u201chas a bridge\u201d indicator nearly clopen and risk losing completeness/Baire; moreover, they tend to give the bridge set interior (so not meagre). These are unlikely to be acceptable \u201cnatural\u201d alternatives if Baire category is the yardstick.\n\nExamples and sanity checks\n- Weighted local metrics d_w are Polish and strongly local; Lemma 1 applies. FO\u2011local metrics induced by the vector of FO\u2011types up to quantifier depth m with weights w_m are strongly local by Gaifman locality.\n- Even D counter\u2011gadget: any attempt to realize a finite sealed T with a single cross-edge violates the parity identity 2|E(T)|=D|T|\u2212|\u2202T| when D is even.\n\nNext steps\n1) Provide a complete, local completion lemma for =D odd: given a finite preball F\u2032 with some vertices saturated to D and others with residual stubs, construct an infinite D\u2011regular extension outside radius r\u2032. A constructive scheme via attaching rooted (D\u22121)\u2011ary trees and a bounded\u2011degree patching of remaining deficits would finish the proof fully rigorously.\n2) Catalogue natural strongly local metrics (weighted local, ultrametrics from decorated balls, FO\u2011local) and record that they are Polish, hence Baire.\n3) Even D in \u2264D: either (i) find a genuinely different forcing that circumvents the parity obstruction (very unlikely without forbid\u2011adjacency), or (ii) settle that \u201cbridgeless is nowhere dense\u201d fails in \u2264D for even D under pure cylinder topologies, correcting the claim from the sketch. A precise impossibility statement would be: no cylinder refinement can force a bridge for even D.\n4) If one broadens to \u201ctame\u201d topologies allowing explicit finite forbid\u2011adjacency data \u03a0 (as in the notes), re\u2011run the sealed\u2011bubble forcing for all D (parity no longer binds because forbiddances, not degrees, block new cross\u2011edges), and check Polishness/Baire to preserve the analytic framework.\n\nSummary\n- We established an invariance scheme (Lemma 1) for strongly local metrics and implemented a correct bridge\u2011forcing gadget for odd D (Lemma 2), yielding meagreness of \u201cbridgeless\u201d that is robust across many natural alternative metrics. We also identified and proved a parity obstruction that forbids the degree\u2011saturation bridge forcing for even D in \u2264D, clarifying a gap in earlier sketches. For even D in =D, bridgeless is already comeagre and remains so under strongly local metrics. The open technical items (regular completion lemma for odd D and the even\u2011D \u2264D case) are now crisply delineated."
