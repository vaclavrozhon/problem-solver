Any metric that declares closeness by matching finitely many rooted balls (possibly with positive weights) is cylinder\u2011rich; see Lemma A below.\\n\\nLemma A (weighted local metrics are cylinder\u2011rich and topologically equivalent to d_\u2022).\\nFix weights (a_r)_{r\\\\ge0} with a_r>0, \\\\sum_r a_r<\\\\infty, and set\\n d_a\\\\big((G,\\\\rho),(H,\\\\sigma)\\\\big)=\\\\sum_{r\\\\ge0} a_r\\\\, \\\\mathbf 1\\\\{B_r(G,\\\\rho)\\\\not\\\\cong B_r(H,\\\\sigma)\\\\}.\\nThen the topology of d_a is exactly \\\\tau_\\\\mathrm{loc}. In particular, it is cylinder\u2011rich.\\nProof. If B_R match then d_a\\\\le\\\\sum_{r>R}a_r, so C(B_R(x)) is open. Conversely, if B_R do not match for all R\\\\ge R_0, then d_a\\\\ge\\\\sum_{r\\\\le R_0}a_r>0, so every d_a\u2011neighborhood contains some cylinder C(B_R) with R large. Hence the generated open sets coincide with unions of cylinders.\\n\\nLemma B (FO\u2011local metrics are cylinder\u2011rich).\\nDefine metric d_\\\\mathrm{FO,k} by d_\\\\mathrm{FO,k}(x,y)=2^{-t} where t is the largest quantifier rank \\\\le k such that x,y satisfy the same rooted FO sentences of rank \u2264 t.

Hence the topology refines \\\\tau_\\\\mathrm{loc} and is cylinder\u2011rich.\\n\\nBridge forcing by a saturated bubble\\nWe first give a uniform gadget for \u2264D and odd D\u2011regular that forces a 1\u2011way infinite bridge in any completion.\\n\\nLemma 1 (saturated bubble forcing, \u2264D).\\nLet D>2 and let U=C(F) be any nonempty cylinder in \\\\mathbf G_{\\\\bullet,\\\\le D}. There exists a larger ball F' with C(F')\\\\subseteq U such that every (G,\\\\rho)\\\\in C(F') has a bridge.\\nProof. Let r be the radius of F and pick a boundary vertex b\\\\in L_r(F) with \\\\deg_F(b)<D (exists since F has infinite extensions). Build a finite connected graph H with a designated vertex z and with all vertices in H of degree D except z of degree D\u22121 (this is easy: take any finite tree, add internal edges until every vertex but one reaches degree D\u22121; then attach one more leaf to z later). Extend F to radius r+3 by: (i) adjoining a new vertex y with edge by to the ball, (ii) attaching H by identifying z with a fresh neighbor of y so that yz is the unique edge from H to the rest of the ball, and (iii) ensure all vertices of H are saturated to degree D within the ball (z\u2019s Dth edge is yz). Do not add any further edge between H and the old part of F. Denote by S the vertex set H\\\\cup\\\\{y\\\\}. Then within the ball, the only edge leaving S is e=by. In any completion respecting \\\\Delta\\\\le D, no vertex of S can receive new edges (already at degree D), hence e remains the unique edge crossing \\\\delta(S). Since S is finite and the graph is connected, e is a 1\u2011way infinite bridge. Leave some other boundary vertices untouched so the cylinder remains nonempty. This yields F' with the stated property.\\n\\nOdd D\u2011regular forcing and completion\\nWe now adapt to \\\\mathbf G_{\\\\bullet,=D} for odd D>2.\\n\\nLemma 2 (odd\u2011regular bubble gadget).\\nLet D=2t+1\\\\ge3. There exists a finite connected simple graph H with a vertex z such that all vertices in H\\\\setminus\\\\{z\\\\} have degree D and z has degree D\u22121.\\nConstruction. Start with any finite D\u2011regular graph R. Pick t disjoint edges E_0=\\\\{u_iv_i\\\\}_{i=1}^t so that R\u2212E_0 is connected (e.g., on a big cycle, take every other edge). Form H by removing E_0 and adding a new vertex z adjacent to all 2t endpoints of E_0. Then \\\\deg_H(z)=2t=D\u22121 and all other vertices regain degree D. H is connected because R\u2212E_0 is.\\n\\nLemma 3 (forcing a bridge in odd D\u2011regular cylinders).\\nLet D be odd. For any nonempty cylinder U=C(F) in \\\\mathbf G_{\\\\bullet,=D}, there exists F' with C(F')\\\\subseteq U such that every (G,\\\\rho)\\\\in C(F') has a bridge.\\nProof. Let r be the radius of F and choose b\\\\in L_r(F) with \\\\deg_F(b)<D (every D\u2011regular completion needs boundary slack). Extend F to radius r+3 by adding a path b\u2013y\u2013z and attach the gadget H of Lemma 2 at z, as in Lemma 1. Within the extended ball, all vertices of H\\\\setminus\\\\{z\\\\} have degree D, z attains degree D after adding yz, and y has degree 2 within the ball; we complete y to degree D by adding D\u22122 neighbors inside the ball and saturating them by internal edges (a small D\u2011regular filler). No other edge joins H to the old part of F besides by. Let S=V(H)\\\\cup\\\\{y\\\\}. Then \\\\delta(S)=\\\\{by\\\\} within the ball, and all vertices in S have degree D already in the ball, so no completion in \\\\mathbf G_{\\\\bullet,=D} can add edges incident to S. Thus by is a bridge in every completion.\\n\\nLemma 4 (D\u2011regular completion lemma, odd D).\\nWith notation as in Lemma 3, there exists an infinite connected D\u2011regular simple graph extending F'.\\nProof. Let m be the number of boundary stubs (sum of residual degrees over boundary vertices) after the modification; m is finite and positive. Take an infinite D\u2011regular tree T=T_D. Choose 2m distinct vertices W=\\\\{w_1,\\\\dots,w_{2m}\\\\} in T far apart. For each i, delete one incident edge of w_i so that all w_i now have degree D\u22121 and T splits into at most 2m components. Partition W into A\\\\cup B with |A|=|B|=m. Add a perfect matching on B by inserting edges between appropriately chosen B\u2011pairs from different components; this produces a connected graph T' in which vertices of B are back to degree D and all w\\\\in A have degree D\u22121, all others still degree D. Now biject boundary stubs of F' with vertices of A and add edges to connect each stub to its matched A\u2011vertex. The result is a connected infinite D\u2011regular simple graph extending F'. (We chose W pairwise distant to avoid parallel edges and ensured connectivity by pairing across components.)\\n\\nConsequences for typicality under cylinder\u2011rich topologies\\nThe key meta\u2011principle is: in any cylinder\u2011rich topology \\\\tau, to prove S is nowhere dense it suffices to show that for every nonempty cylinder C(F) there exists a refined cylinder C(F')\\\\subseteq C(F) with C(F')\\\\cap S=\\\\varnothing.\\n\\nTheorem 5 (no\u2011go under cylinder\u2011rich topologies).\\nLet \\\\tau be any cylinder\u2011rich topology on \\\\mathbf G_{\\\\bullet,\\\\le D} with D>2. Then the bridgeless set is nowhere dense in (\\\\mathbf G_{\\\\bullet,\\\\le D},\\\\tau). If D is odd, the same holds in (\\\\mathbf G_{\\\\bullet,=D},\\\\tau).\\nProof. Apply Lemma 1 (\u2264D) or Lemma 3 (odd =D) inside any cylinder contained in a given \\\\tau\u2011open set.\\n\\nMeagreness of 2\u2011way infinite bridges; even\u2011regular comeagreness of bridgeless\\nFor k\\\\in\\\\mathbb N let P_k be the set of rooted graphs having a 2\u2011way infinite bridge at distance \u2264k from the root.\\n\\nLemma 6 (cycle shielding; P_k nowhere dense in \u2264D).\\nFix D>2 and k. For any cylinder C(F) with radius r\u2265k, there exists a cylinder C(F')\\\\subseteq C(F) such that every graph in C(F') has no 2\u2011way infinite bridge at distance \u2264k.\\nProof. Let E_k be the finite set of edges of F whose midpoint distance to the root is \u2264k. For e\\\\in E_k, let A_e and B_e be the two components of F\u2212e. If at least one of A_e,B_e has no boundary vertex v\\\\in L_r(F) with \\\\deg_F(v)<D, then in any extension of C(F), that side cannot become infinite; thus e cannot be a 2\u2011way infinite bridge\u2014we ignore such e. For the remaining e, pick boundary vertices v_A\\\\in A_e\\\\cap L_r(F), v_B\\\\in B_e\\\\cap L_r(F) with \\\\deg_F(v_A),\\\\deg_F(v_B)<D. Enlarge the ball to radius r+2 by, for each such e, adding fresh vertices s_A^e,s_B^e at distance r+1 adjacent to v_A,v_B, respectively, and a fresh vertex c_e at distance r+2 adjacent to s_A^e and s_B^e. All these attachments for different e are made pairwise disjoint. This creates, for each e, a cycle that contains e (the unique path in F between v_A and v_B passes through e). No further degree exceeds D. Let F' be the resulting (r+2)\u2011ball. In any completion of C(F'), each e\\\\in E_k above lies on a cycle, hence cannot be a bridge; thus P_k is avoided.\\n\\nLemma 7 (P_k nowhere dense in =D).\\nThe same conclusion holds in \\\\mathbf G_{\\\\bullet,=D}. For each used boundary vertex v in Lemma 6, we additionally saturate v to degree D inside the enlarged ball by attaching a local D\u2011regular filler (e.g., K_{D+1}\u2212e gadgets chained so that the new vertices also reach degree D within the ball). The disjointness ensures feasibility. Therefore no 2\u2011way bridge at distance \u2264k can occur in any D\u2011regular completion of the refined cylinder.\\n\\nProposition 8 (2\u2011way bridges are meagre but dense).\\nFor D>2, the set P=\\\\bigcup_k P_k is meagre in \\\\mathbf G_{\\\\bullet,D}. It is dense as well.\\nProof. Meagre: countable union of nowhere dense sets by Lemmas 6\u20137. Dense: given any cylinder, attach far outside a double ray and link its two sides by a single edge (keeping degrees \u2264D by using spare degree at a distant boundary vertex); this creates a 2\u2011way infinite bridge arbitrarily far from the root without affecting the inner ball.\\n\\nCorollary 9 (even\u2011regular comeagre bridgeless).\\nIn \\\\mathbf G_{\\\\bullet,=D} with even D>2, every bridge is 2\u2011way infinite (degree parity argument). Hence the set of bridged graphs equals P, which is meagre by Proposition 8. Therefore bridgeless graphs are comeagre under d_\u2022 (and any topologically equivalent cylinder\u2011rich metric).\\n\\nExamples\\n- D=3 odd\u2011regular forcing: Let R be any 3\u2011regular finite graph (e.g., a prism). Remove one edge uv and add z adjacent to u,v; now \\\\deg(z)=2, others stay 3. Attach as in Lemma 3 to force a bridge in every 3\u2011regular completion while preserving extendability by Lemma 4.\\n- D=4 even\u2011regular: By Corollary 9, bridgeless is already comeagre; no alternative metric is needed to flip typicality.\\n\\nObstacles and clarifications\\n- \u201cNowhere dense is preserved under refinement\u201d is false in general. We avoid this by working within cylinder\u2011rich topologies, where forcing is executed inside cylinders contained in arbitrary open sets.\\n- For even D\u2011regular, saturated bubbles creating 1\u2011way bridges are impossible (finite component parity). Our meagreness proof for 2\u2011way bridges fills the gap.\\n- The D\u2011regular completion Lemma 4 is tailored to odd D forcing; it is constructive and avoids multi\u2011edges by choosing distant vertices in T_D.\\n\\nNatural alternative metrics\\n- Weighted local metrics and FO\u2011local metrics are cylinder\u2011rich (Lemmas A\u2013B); hence typicality of bridgeless is the same as under d_\u2022.\\n- Any metric whose open sets admit cylinders as a local base falls into this class. Therefore, within this broad and natural family, there is no metric making bridgeless typical on \\\\mathbf G_{\\\\bullet,\\\\le D} (D>2) or on \\\\mathbf G_{\\\\bullet,=D} for odd D.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Formalize a broader \u201ctame\u201d class with basic opens A(F,\\\\Pi) (finite ball plus finite boundary budget/forbiddance data), prove it is Polish/Baire, and verify that common coding/logical metrics belong to it.\\n- Extend Lemma 4 to an explicit \u201creservoir\u201d completion scheme in full generality (handling simplicity and connectivity systematically).\\n- Explore genuinely nonlocal, end\u2011aware inverse\u2011limit topologies: define basic clopens by fixing an r\u2011ball together with the number of rays exiting each boundary vertex. Prove Baire/metrizability and test whether \u201cno 1\u2011edge cut across finite S\u201d is comeagre there (which would kill 1\u2011way bridges). Assess the status of 2\u2011way bridges in that topology.\\n\\nSummary\\n- In any cylinder\u2011rich (strongly local) topology, bridgeless graphs are nowhere dense in \\\\mathbf G_{\\\\bullet,\\\\le D} (D>2) and in \\\\mathbf G_{\\\\bullet,=D} for odd D. For even D\u2011regular, bridgeless is already comeagre under the usual local topology (2\u2011way bridges are meagre). Weighted local and FO\u2011local metrics do not change these conclusions. A change of typicality for bridges would require a genuinely nonlocal topology; candidates are proposed but remain to be analyzed for Baire properties and density arguments.\"}",
