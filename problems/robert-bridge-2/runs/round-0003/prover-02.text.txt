Ideas
- Formalize a class of “strongly local” (cylinder‑rich) topologies on X=G_{\bullet,D} under which local forcing arguments go through, and prove that bridgeless graphs are not typical there (≤D for all D>2; =D for odd D>2).
- Give clean, verifiable constructions: (i) a saturated finite bubble forcing a 1‑way infinite bridge in ≤D and in odd D‑regular; (ii) a D‑regular completion lemma ensuring the refined ball admits an infinite regular extension; (iii) a complete proof that “has a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance ≤k” is nowhere dense, hence 2‑way bridges are meagre; consequently, in even D‑regular, bridgeless is already comeagre under d_•.
- Catalog natural alternative metrics that are cylinder‑rich (weighted local, FO‑local), concluding no change in typicality there.

Definitions
- Cylinder sets: for a rooted r‑ball F, C(F):=G_\bullet^F={ (G,\rho): B_r(G,\rho)\cong F }.
- A topology \tau on X is cylinder‑rich if for every x\in X and every \tau‑open U\ni x there exists r with C(B_r(x))\subseteq U.
Remarks: The local (Benjamini–Schramm) topology \tau_\mathrm{loc} is cylinder‑rich with base {C(F)}. Any metric that declares closeness by matching finitely many rooted balls (possibly with positive weights) is cylinder‑rich; see Lemma A below.

Lemma A (weighted local metrics are cylinder‑rich and topologically equivalent to d_•).
Fix weights (a_r)_{r\ge0} with a_r>0, \sum_r a_r<\infty, and set
 d_a\big((G,\rho),(H,\sigma)\big)=\sum_{r\ge0} a_r\, \mathbf 1\{B_r(G,\rho)\not\cong B_r(H,\sigma)\}.
Then the topology of d_a is exactly \tau_\mathrm{loc}. In particular, it is cylinder‑rich.
Proof. If B_R match then d_a\le\sum_{r>R}a_r, so C(B_R(x)) is open. Conversely, if B_R do not match for all R\ge R_0, then d_a\ge\sum_{r\le R_0}a_r>0, so every d_a‑neighborhood contains some cylinder C(B_R) with R large. Hence the generated open sets coincide with unions of cylinders.

Lemma B (FO‑local metrics are cylinder‑rich).
Define metric d_\mathrm{FO,k} by d_\mathrm{FO,k}(x,y)=2^{-t} where t is the largest quantifier rank \le k such that x,y satisfy the same rooted FO sentences of rank ≤ t. On degree‑bounded classes, Gaifman locality implies agreement on FO sentences of rank t entails agreement on r‑balls for r=c(D)\cdot 2^t. Hence the topology refines \tau_\mathrm{loc} and is cylinder‑rich.

Bridge forcing by a saturated bubble
We first give a uniform gadget for ≤D and odd D‑regular that forces a 1‑way infinite bridge in any completion.

Lemma 1 (saturated bubble forcing, ≤D).
Let D>2 and let U=C(F) be any nonempty cylinder in \mathbf G_{\bullet,\le D}. There exists a larger ball F' with C(F')\subseteq U such that every (G,\rho)\in C(F') has a bridge.
Proof. Let r be the radius of F and pick a boundary vertex b\in L_r(F) with \deg_F(b)<D (exists since F has infinite extensions). Build a finite connected graph H with a designated vertex z and with all vertices in H of degree D except z of degree D−1 (this is easy: take any finite tree, add internal edges until every vertex but one reaches degree D−1; then attach one more leaf to z later). Extend F to radius r+3 by: (i) adjoining a new vertex y with edge by to the ball, (ii) attaching H by identifying z with a fresh neighbor of y so that yz is the unique edge from H to the rest of the ball, and (iii) ensure all vertices of H are saturated to degree D within the ball (z’s Dth edge is yz). Do not add any further edge between H and the old part of F. Denote by S the vertex set H\cup\{y\}. Then within the ball, the only edge leaving S is e=by. In any completion respecting \Delta\le D, no vertex of S can receive new edges (already at degree D), hence e remains the unique edge crossing \delta(S). Since S is finite and the graph is connected, e is a 1‑way infinite bridge. Leave some other boundary vertices untouched so the cylinder remains nonempty. This yields F' with the stated property.

Odd D‑regular forcing and completion
We now adapt to \mathbf G_{\bullet,=D} for odd D>2.

Lemma 2 (odd‑regular bubble gadget).
Let D=2t+1\ge3. There exists a finite connected simple graph H with a vertex z such that all vertices in H\setminus\{z\} have degree D and z has degree D−1.
Construction. Start with any finite D‑regular graph R. Pick t disjoint edges E_0=\{u_iv_i\}_{i=1}^t so that R−E_0 is connected (e.g., on a big cycle, take every other edge). Form H by removing E_0 and adding a new vertex z adjacent to all 2t endpoints of E_0. Then \deg_H(z)=2t=D−1 and all other vertices regain degree D. H is connected because R−E_0 is.

Lemma 3 (forcing a bridge in odd D‑regular cylinders).
Let D be odd. For any nonempty cylinder U=C(F) in \mathbf G_{\bullet,=D}, there exists F' with C(F')\subseteq U such that every (G,\rho)\in C(F') has a bridge.
Proof. Let r be the radius of F and choose b\in L_r(F) with \deg_F(b)<D (every D‑regular completion needs boundary slack). Extend F to radius r+3 by adding a path b–y–z and attach the gadget H of Lemma 2 at z, as in Lemma 1. Within the extended ball, all vertices of H\setminus\{z\} have degree D, z attains degree D after adding yz, and y has degree 2 within the ball; we complete y to degree D by adding D−2 neighbors inside the ball and saturating them by internal edges (a small D‑regular filler). No other edge joins H to the old part of F besides by. Let S=V(H)\cup\{y\}. Then \delta(S)=\{by\} within the ball, and all vertices in S have degree D already in the ball, so no completion in \mathbf G_{\bullet,=D} can add edges incident to S. Thus by is a bridge in every completion.

Lemma 4 (D‑regular completion lemma, odd D).
With notation as in Lemma 3, there exists an infinite connected D‑regular simple graph extending F'.
Proof. Let m be the number of boundary stubs (sum of residual degrees over boundary vertices) after the modification; m is finite and positive. Take an infinite D‑regular tree T=T_D. Choose 2m distinct vertices W=\{w_1,\dots,w_{2m}\} in T far apart. For each i, delete one incident edge of w_i so that all w_i now have degree D−1 and T splits into at most 2m components. Partition W into A\cup B with |A|=|B|=m. Add a perfect matching on B by inserting edges between appropriately chosen B‑pairs from different components; this produces a connected graph T' in which vertices of B are back to degree D and all w\in A have degree D−1, all others still degree D. Now biject boundary stubs of F' with vertices of A and add edges to connect each stub to its matched A‑vertex. The result is a connected infinite D‑regular simple graph extending F'. (We chose W pairwise distant to avoid parallel edges and ensured connectivity by pairing across components.)

Consequences for typicality under cylinder‑rich topologies
The key meta‑principle is: in any cylinder‑rich topology \tau, to prove S is nowhere dense it suffices to show that for every nonempty cylinder C(F) there exists a refined cylinder C(F')\subseteq C(F) with C(F')\cap S=\varnothing.

Theorem 5 (no‑go under cylinder‑rich topologies).
Let \tau be any cylinder‑rich topology on \mathbf G_{\bullet,\le D} with D>2. Then the bridgeless set is nowhere dense in (\mathbf G_{\bullet,\le D},\tau). If D is odd, the same holds in (\mathbf G_{\bullet,=D},\tau).
Proof. Apply Lemma 1 (≤D) or Lemma 3 (odd =D) inside any cylinder contained in a given \tau‑open set.

Meagreness of 2‑way infinite bridges; even‑regular comeagreness of bridgeless
For k\in\mathbb N let P_k be the set of rooted graphs having a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance ≤k from the root.

Lemma 6 (cycle shielding; P_k nowhere dense in ≤D).
Fix D>2 and k. For any cylinder C(F) with radius r≥k, there exists a cylinder C(F')\subseteq C(F) such that every graph in C(F') has no 2‑way infinite bridge at distance ≤k.
Proof. Let E_k be the finite set of edges of F whose midpoint distance to the root is ≤k. For e\in E_k, let A_e and B_e be the two components of F−e. If at least one of A_e,B_e has no boundary vertex v\in L_r(F) with \deg_F(v)<D, then in any extension of C(F), that side cannot become infinite; thus e cannot be a 2‑way infinite bridge—we ignore such e. For the remaining e, pick boundary vertices v_A\in A_e\cap L_r(F), v_B\in B_e\cap L_r(F) with \deg_F(v_A),\deg_F(v_B)<D. Enlarge the ball to radius r+2 by, for each such e, adding fresh vertices s_A^e,s_B^e at distance r+1 adjacent to v_A,v_B, respectively, and a fresh vertex c_e at distance r+2 adjacent to s_A^e and s_B^e. All these attachments for different e are made pairwise disjoint. This creates, for each e, a cycle that contains e (the unique path in F between v_A and v_B passes through e). No further degree exceeds D. Let F' be the resulting (r+2)‑ball. In any completion of C(F'), each e\in E_k above lies on a cycle, hence cannot be a bridge; thus P_k is avoided.

Lemma 7 (P_k nowhere dense in =D).
The same conclusion holds in \mathbf G_{\bullet,=D}. For each used boundary vertex v in Lemma 6, we additionally saturate v to degree D inside the enlarged ball by attaching a local D‑regular filler (e.g., K_{D+1}−e gadgets chained so that the new vertices also reach degree D within the ball). The disjointness ensures feasibility. Therefore no 2‑way bridge at distance ≤k can occur in any D‑regular completion of the refined cylinder.

Proposition 8 (2‑way bridges are meagre but dense).
For D>2, the set P=\bigcup_k P_k is meagre in \mathbf G_{\bullet,D}. It is dense as well.
Proof. Meagre: countable union of nowhere dense sets by Lemmas 6–7. Dense: given any cylinder, attach far outside a double ray and link its two sides by a single edge (keeping degrees ≤D by using spare degree at a distant boundary vertex); this creates a 2‑way infinite bridge arbitrarily far from the root without affecting the inner ball.

Corollary 9 (even‑regular comeagre bridgeless).
In \mathbf G_{\bullet,=D} with even D>2, every bridge is 2‑way infinite (degree parity argument). Hence the set of bridged graphs equals P, which is meagre by Proposition 8. Therefore bridgeless graphs are comeagre under d_• (and any topologically equivalent cylinder‑rich metric).

Examples
- D=3 odd‑regular forcing: Let R be any 3‑regular finite graph (e.g., a prism). Remove one edge uv and add z adjacent to u,v; now \deg(z)=2, others stay 3. Attach as in Lemma 3 to force a bridge in every 3‑regular completion while preserving extendability by Lemma 4.
- D=4 even‑regular: By Corollary 9, bridgeless is already comeagre; no alternative metric is needed to flip typicality.

Obstacles and clarifications
- “Nowhere dense is preserved under refinement” is false in general. We avoid this by working within cylinder‑rich topologies, where forcing is executed inside cylinders contained in arbitrary open sets.
- For even D‑regular, saturated bubbles creating 1‑way bridges are impossible (finite component parity). Our meagreness proof for 2‑way bridges fills the gap.
- The D‑regular completion Lemma 4 is tailored to odd D forcing; it is constructive and avoids multi‑edges by choosing distant vertices in T_D.

Natural alternative metrics
- Weighted local metrics and FO‑local metrics are cylinder‑rich (Lemmas A–B); hence typicality of bridgeless is the same as under d_•.
- Any metric whose open sets admit cylinders as a local base falls into this class. Therefore, within this broad and natural family, there is no metric making bridgeless typical on \mathbf G_{\bullet,\le D} (D>2) or on \mathbf G_{\bullet,=D} for odd D.

Next steps
- Formalize a broader “tame” class with basic opens A(F,\Pi) (finite ball plus finite boundary budget/forbiddance data), prove it is Polish/Baire, and verify that common coding/logical metrics belong to it.
- Extend Lemma 4 to an explicit “reservoir” completion scheme in full generality (handling simplicity and connectivity systematically).
- Explore genuinely nonlocal, end‑aware inverse‑limit topologies: define basic clopens by fixing an r‑ball together with the number of rays exiting each boundary vertex. Prove Baire/metrizability and test whether “no 1‑edge cut across finite S” is comeagre there (which would kill 1‑way bridges). Assess the status of 2‑way bridges in that topology.

Summary
- In any cylinder‑rich (strongly local) topology, bridgeless graphs are nowhere dense in \mathbf G_{\bullet,\le D} (D>2) and in \mathbf G_{\bullet,=D} for odd D. For even D‑regular, bridgeless is already comeagre under the usual local topology (2‑way bridges are meagre). Weighted local and FO‑local metrics do not change these conclusions. A change of typicality for bridges would require a genuinely nonlocal topology; candidates are proposed but remain to be analyzed for Baire properties and density arguments.
