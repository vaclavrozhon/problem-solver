Analysis focus and plan
- I audit the core topological lemmas and the three bridge‑typicality theorems (14–16), flagging logical gaps and offering corrections with explicit local constructions. I also delimit a class of alternative metrics/topologies under which the typicality of “bridgeless” cannot change (in ≤D and odd regular cases), and I correct parity and degree‑saturation issues. Finally, I point out that Theorem 17 needs a different forcer.

Foundational corrections: cylinders and nowhere denseness
- Cylinders are clopen. If F is a realized r‑ball, the cylinder G_•^F is open by definition. It is also closed in the local topology: if (G_n,ρ_n) ∈ G_•^F and (G_n,ρ_n) → (G,ρ), then for s ≤ r we eventually have B_s(G_n,ρ_n) ≅ B_s(G,ρ); hence B_r(G,ρ) ≅ F, i.e., (G,ρ) ∈ G_•^F.
- Corrected criterion. A set S is nowhere dense iff for every realized r‑ball F there exists a realized r′‑ball F′ with G_•^{F′} ⊆ G_•^{F} and G_•^{F′} ∩ cl(S) = ∅. In all uses here, we will actually construct G_•^{F′} ⊆ G_•^{F} with G_•^{F′} ⊆ X \ S, which is stronger. The current Lemma 13 should be amended accordingly (it incorrectly omits closure).
- Nonemptiness (≤D). If F is a realized r‑ball in G_{•,≤D}, then some boundary vertex v ∈ L_r(F) has deg_F(v) < D; otherwise no infinite extension is possible. Conversely, if some boundary vertex has residual degree, one can extend to an infinite graph by attaching a (≤D) tree. This sharpens the second bullet of Lemma 13.

Robust bridge forcing in ≤D (all D ≥ 2)
Lemma (finite saturated bubble in ≤D). Let D ≥ 2. For any realized cylinder G_{•,≤D}^{F} (radius r) and any boundary vertex u ∈ L_r(F) with deg_F(u) ≤ D − 1, there exist R > r and a realized cylinder G_{•,≤D}^{F′} ⊆ G_{•,≤D}^{F} such that every graph in G_{•,≤D}^{F′} has a 1‑way infinite bridge e incident with u.
Proof. Outside B_r, build a finite “bubble” H with a designated vertex w, and place H entirely within B_R while remaining disjoint from B_r except at u after adding e = uw. Choose H so that every vertex of H except possibly w has degree D inside B_R; let w have degree D − 1 inside H so that after adding e within B_R it also has degree D. Thus every vertex of H has D incident edges accounted for already within B_R; in any completion with B_R fixed and degree bound ≤ D, no further edges can attach to H without violating ≤ D. Therefore across the cut (V(H), V(G) \ V(H)) there is exactly one edge, e, hence e is a bridge. To ensure G_{•,≤D}^{F′} is nonempty, leave some other boundary vertex x of B_R with deg_{B_R}(x) < D so that infinite completions can be grown outside along x. QED.
Remarks.
- This replaces the incorrect “attach a leaf” step (an extension could attach more edges at the leaf). The degree‑saturated bubble blocks that.

Odd D regular bridge forcing (D odd, =D)
- Parity obstruction. In even D‑regular graphs there is no 1‑way infinite bridge: removing a bridge with a finite component A yields ∑_{v∈A} deg = D|A| − 1, odd, impossible.
- For D odd, we can use a D‑saturated bubble as above. The only extra ingredient is an explicit finite H in which all vertices have degree D except one vertex w with degree D − 1; after adding e = uw inside B_R, every vertex of H has degree D within B_R, so no outside attachments are possible at H in any =D completion, and e is a bridge. Existence of such H:
  Construction for general odd D ≥ 3. Start with K_{D+2} (every vertex has degree D+1). Remove the edges of a Hamiltonian cycle C, reducing every vertex’s degree by 2 (to D − 1). Then add a maximum matching M in K_{D+2} \ E(C) that leaves a prescribed vertex w unmatched (since D+2 is odd, a maximum matching covers all but one vertex). Now every matched vertex has degree D, and w has degree D − 1. The resulting simple graph H is connected and has the desired degree sequence. Place H as above to obtain F′. Nonemptiness is ensured by leaving other boundary capacity for infinite completions. This yields Theorem 14(ii) rigorously for odd D.

Meagreness and density of 2‑way infinite bridges (Theorem 16)
Fix D > 2 and X ∈ {G_{•,≤D}, G_{•,=D}}.
- Nowhere dense at fixed distance. For k ∈ N, let P_k be the set of graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance ≤ k from the root. Given a realized cylinder G_{•}^{F} (radius r), let E_k be the set of edges of F at distance ≤ k. Call e ∈ E_k critical if in F − e both components contain at least one boundary vertex with residual degree (< D); otherwise e is safe. A safe e can never be a 2‑way infinite bridge in any extension of F (one side has no capacity to become infinite). For the finitely many critical edges, choose a finite subset S ⊆ L_r(F) containing at least one residual boundary vertex from each side of each critical e. Outside B_r attach, for each v ∈ S, a new vertex x_v adjacent to v, and connect the x_v in a single simple cycle that lies entirely outside B_r. Let H be this finite extension and set F′ = B_R(H) for some R > r encompassing the cycle. Then for each critical e = ab there exists v_A, v_B ∈ S on the two sides of F−e and a path in F−e from a to v_A and from b to v_B; concatenating these with the x‑cycle yields an a–b path outside e contained in B_R(H). Thus no e ∈ E_k is a bridge in any completion with B_R fixed, and so G_•^{F′} ⊆ G_•^{F} \ P_k. Ensuring nonemptiness: when defining S and the cycle, leave at least one boundary vertex (possibly new, beyond radius r) with residual capacity unused; hence completions exist. Therefore P_k is nowhere dense.
- Meagreness. P = ⋃_{k} P_k is meagre.
- Density (not nowhere dense). For any realized cylinder G_•^{F} pick a boundary vertex u with residual degree and build an extension outside B_r that, at some large radius, contains a large D‑bounded (or D‑regular) tree T attached only at u. In ≤ D this is straightforward; in = D attach disjoint D‑regular trees to fill degrees at boundary vertices so the global extension is D‑regular. Every edge deep in T is then a 2‑way infinite bridge (both sides infinite), so P ∩ G_•^{F} ≠ ∅; hence P is dense. Consequently P is meagre but not nowhere dense.
Corollary (even D regular). In G_{•,=D} with even D, “has a bridge” = “has a 2‑way infinite bridge” is meagre; hence bridgeless graphs are comeagre in the standard local topology.

Consequences for Theorem 14 and 15
- Theorem 14(i): Replace the pendant‑leaf argument with the saturated bubble lemma in ≤ D. This yields, in every cylinder, a subcylinder all of whose members have a bridge, so bridgeless graphs form a nowhere dense set.
- Theorem 14(ii): For odd D, use the D‑regular bubble constructed via K_{D+2} minus a Hamiltonian cycle plus a maximum matching to produce H with one D−1 terminal, then attach it by a single edge as above. Parity blocks even D.
- Theorem 15: “No cut vertex” is nowhere dense by the same forcing: the bubble cut edge certifies a cut vertex on the core‑side. For even D regular, the above construction adapted to force a cut vertex (two D‑regular blobs meeting at one vertex, all degrees saturated within B_R) should be written down explicitly.

Theorem 17 (edge‑chromatic number)
- The parity‑based sketch is invalid. Removing an edge can reduce χ′. To establish nowhere denseness of “χ′ = D” one needs a finite class‑II forcer H_D and an embedding lemma respecting degree bounds at the boundary. Suggested route: use overfull subgraphs (for even D) and Tutte barriers (for odd D) to produce a finite D‑bounded H_D with χ′(H_D) = D + 1. Then show how to implant H_D inside a cylinder by saturating degrees on the H_D side within B_R so outside edges cannot facilitate a D‑edge‑coloring. Until this is supplied, Theorem 17 should be marked as open.

Topological sensitivity: which metric changes can matter?
- Any alternative topology τ that contains all local cylinders as open sets (call such τ cylinder‑open) preserves the nowhere‑denseness proofs above: every τ‑open set contains some local cylinder G_•^{F}, and by the bubble‑forcing there exists a subcylinder G_•^{F′} ⊆ G_•^{F} disjoint from the bridgeless set (≤D and odd regular). Hence in any cylinder‑open metric/topology, bridgeless graphs remain atypical in these spaces.
- For even D regular, bridgeless is already comeagre under the local topology; no metric change is needed to make them typical.
- Thus, to change typicality for ≤D or odd D regular, one must use a topology that is not cylinder‑open (genuinely nonlocal). Before pursuing such candidates, one should prove metrizability and Baire property, then re‑test density via local forcing; at present, no such “natural” nonlocal Baire topology is specified.

Examples and checks
- Explicit H for D = 3. On vertices {w, b, x, y, z}, start with K_5 and remove edges wb and wx; degrees become deg(w)=2, deg(b)=3, deg(x)=3, deg(y)=4, deg(z)=4; then remove edge yz to get degrees (2,3,3,3,3), a simple connected graph. Use w as the bubble terminal. This instantiates the odd‑regular bubble construction.
- Safety/critical classification in the meagreness proof can be verified on small balls: if one component of F − e has no boundary residual degree, that side cannot be made infinite in any ≤D or =D completion that preserves the ball; hence e cannot become a 2‑way bridge.

Obstacles and to‑dos
- Write the odd‑regular bubble forcing with full quantifiers and include the explicit H(D) construction via K_{D+2} − C + M, plus the existence of D‑regular infinite completions leaving some boundary capacity.
- Provide the detailed proof of the meagreness result in =D, including the step that attaches disjoint D‑regular trees to all used new vertices so that the extension remains D‑regular.
- Catalog common alternative metrics/topologies that are cylinder‑open (equivalent ultrametrics, weighted sums over r‑balls, FO‑local pseudometrics, BFS‑coding topologies) and state the invariance corollary explicitly for them.
- Revise Theorem 17 or mark it open pending a correct forcer and embedding lemma.

Summary of key fixes
- Correct Lemma 13’s closure issue and add the clopen cylinder fact.
- Replace leaf‑forcing with degree‑saturated bubble forcing in ≤D and odd‑regular; supply an explicit odd‑regular finite bubble H (construction via K_{D+2}).
- Prove that “has a 2‑way infinite bridge” is dense meagre (full local construction supplied), yielding that bridgeless is comeagre in =D with even D.
- Prove invariance of “bridgeless atypical” under any cylinder‑open topology; thus no “natural” cylinder‑open metric can flip typicality in ≤D or odd‑regular. For even D regular, bridgeless typicality already holds under the local metric.
