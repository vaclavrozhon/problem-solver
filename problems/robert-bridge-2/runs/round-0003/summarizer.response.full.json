Using this, we proved that in any cylinder\u2011rich / strongly\u2011local topology (including the Benjamini\u2013Schramm metric and many natural local metrics) the set of bridgeless rooted graphs is nowhere dense in G_{\u2022,\u2264D} and in G_{\u2022,=D} for odd D\u22653. A parity obstruction shows the sealed\u2011bubble method cannot produce a single\u2011edge cut when D is even (all vertices in the finite side would have even degree), and we proved separately that 2\u2011way infinite bridges are dense but meagre for D>2; consequently, in the even D regular space (=D) bridgeless graphs are comeagre. Nonlocal metrics can trivially change openness (e.g. adding a global \u201chas a bridge\u201d bit) but any candidate must be shown metrizable/Baire and its density behavior checked.
