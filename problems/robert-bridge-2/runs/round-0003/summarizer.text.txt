{"summary_md":"Final round: replaced the invalid leaf‑forcing with a robust “sealed bubble” (finite D‑saturated block H attached by a single edge) that makes that edge a bridge in every completion. Using this, we proved that in any cylinder‑rich / strongly‑local topology (including the Benjamini–Schramm metric and many natural local metrics) the set of bridgeless rooted graphs is nowhere dense in G_{•,≤D} and in G_{•,=D} for odd D≥3. A parity obstruction shows the sealed‑bubble method cannot produce a single‑edge cut when D is even (all vertices in the finite side would have even degree), and we proved separately that 2‑way infinite bridges are dense but meagre for D>2; consequently, in the even D regular space (=D) bridgeless graphs are comeagre. Nonlocal metrics can trivially change openness (e.g. adding a global “has a bridge” bit) but any candidate must be shown metrizable/Baire and its density behavior checked.
