Replaced invalid leaf forcing with sealed finite bubbles and proved forcing only works for odd D (parity blocks even D). Established that 2‑way infinite bridges form a dense meagre set in both ≤D and =D; hence in even D‑regular, bridgeless is comeagre under the local metric. Within strongly local (cylinder‑dominating) metrics, bridgeless is nowhere dense in ≤D (odd D) and =D (odd D). The even D case in ≤D remains open; avoid incorrect claims there. Next: finalize D‑regular completion (odd D) and formalize the strongly local metric class as Polish.
