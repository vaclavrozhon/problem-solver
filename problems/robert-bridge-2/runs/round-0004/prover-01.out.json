  "content": "Ideas\n- We isolate a broad, Baire-safe class of alternative metrics on X=G_{\\bullet,D}: strongly local (cylinder-dominating) metrics. We then prove an invariance lemma: any property whose complement can be forced inside a cylinder remains nowhere dense under any such metric.\n- We implement this forcing for \u201cbridgeless\u201d when D is odd (both \u2264D and =D). The forcing gadget is a sealed finite bubble attached by a single edge; we give a complete existence and a simple D-regular completion lemma based on attaching (D\u22121)-ary infinite trees.\n- For even D we prove a parity obstruction forbidding sealed one-edge cuts in cylinder-based forcing on \u2264D. Consequently, the odd-D result cannot be extended to even D via degree saturation alone. We also give a clean proof that \u201c2-way infinite bridge\u201d is meagre (and dense) uniformly across strongly local metrics.\n\nDefinitions\n- Strongly local (cylinder-dominating) metric. A metric d on X is strongly local if there exists \u03c8:(0,1]\u2192\\mathbb{N} with d(x,y)<\u03b5 \u21d2 B_{\u03c8(\u03b5)}(x)\u2245B_{\u03c8(\u03b5)}(y). Equivalently, every d-ball around x contains some local cylinder C(B_r(x)). Examples: weighted local metrics d_w(x,y)=\u2211_{r\u22650} w_r\u00b71_{B_r(x)\u2244B_r(y)} with w_r\u21980 and \u2211 w_r<\u221e; FO-local metrics using Gaifman locality; all are Polish and strongly local.\n- Cylinder C(F):= {x\u2208X: B_r(x)\u2245F} for an r-ball F.\n\nLemma 1 (robust nowhere-denseness under strongly local metrics)\nLet d be strongly local on X and S\u2282X satisfy: for every r-ball F with C(F)\u2260\\varnothing there is r\u2032\u2265r and an r\u2032-ball F\u2032 extending F with C(F\u2032)\u2260\\varnothing and C(F\u2032)\u2286X\\S. Then S is nowhere dense in (X,d).\nProof. If U is a nonempty d-open set around x, choose \u03b5>0 with B_d(x,\u03b5)\u2282U and r=\u03c8(\u03b5). Then B_d(x,\u03b5)\u2282C(B_r(x)). By hypothesis, some F\u2032 extending B_r(x) satisfies C(F\u2032)\u2282X\\S and is nonempty. For any y\u2208C(F\u2032) and \u03b4>0 with \u03c8(\u03b4)\u2265r\u2032, we have B_d(y,\u03b4)\u2282C(F\u2032)\u2282X\\S. Hence every nonempty d-open U contains a nonempty d-open subset disjoint from S. Thus int_d(\\overline{S}^d)=\u2205.\n\nOdd D forcing gadget and completion\nLemma 2 (sealed bubble for odd D). Fix odd D\u22653. There exists an n\u2265D+2 (odd) and a connected simple graph T on vertices {t_0,\u2026,t_{n\u22121}} with degree sequence (D\u22121,D,\u2026,D). Given any cylinder C(F) with a boundary vertex u\u2208L_r(F) having deg_F(u)<D, form F\u2032 by adjoining a disjoint copy of T and a single edge e=ut_0. Then in any extension of F\u2032 within X=G_{\\bullet,\u2264D} or X=G_{\\bullet,=D} (odd D), the edge e is a 1\u2011way infinite bridge.\nProof. Existence of T: The Erd\u0151s\u2013Gallai inequalities hold for d=(D,\u2026,D,D\u22121) when n is odd and n\u2265D+2: parity \u2211 d_i=Dn\u22121 is even (D and n odd); for 1\u2264k\u2264n\u22121, Dk\u2264k(k\u22121)+(n\u2212k)min(D,k) holds by the standard split k\u2264D and k\u2265D+1 (the latter reduces to 0\u2264k^2\u2212(1+2D)k+nD, minimized at k=D+1 with value D(n\u2212D\u22121)\u2265D>0). Connectivity follows by degree-preserving edge switches. In F\u2032, every vertex in T has degree D (counting e at t_0). Hence no extension may add edges incident to T without violating the \u2264D or =D constraint. The only edge between T and its complement is e, so deleting e separates the finite set T from the rest (infinite), making e a 1\u2011way infinite bridge in every extension.\n\nLemma 3 (D-regular completion outside a finite preball). Fix D\u22653. Let H be a finite connected graph with max degree \u2264D. For each vertex v\u2208V(H), let c(v)=D\u2212deg_H(v)\u22650. For each of the c(v) units, attach a disjoint rooted infinite (D\u22121)-ary tree T_{v,i} whose root s_{v,i} has degree D\u22121 in T_{v,i}, and add the edge vs_{v,i}. Denote G the union of H and all T_{v,i}. Then G is infinite, connected, and D\u2011regular.\nProof. Each root s_{v,i} gains one extra neighbor v and reaches degree D; every other node of T_{v,i} has one parent and D\u22121 children, hence degree D. Each v in H gains c(v) new neighbors and reaches degree D. Connectivity holds since each T_{v,i} is attached to H.\nConsequently, in Lemma 2, C(F\u2032)\u2260\\varnothing in both \u2264D and =D (odd) by taking H:=F\u2032 and completing via Lemma 3.\n\nParity obstruction for even D\nProposition 4 (no sealed one-edge cut when D is even). Let D be even. Let S be a finite vertex set in a graph G whose every vertex has degree D in G. Then |\u2202S| is even. In particular, there is no way to realize a sealed finite side with exactly one cross-edge in \u2264D by saturating all vertices of that side to degree D.\nProof. The handshaking identity gives \u2211_{v\u2208S} deg_G(v)=2|E(S)|+|\u2202S|. If deg_G(v)=D for all v\u2208S, then D|S|=2|E(S)|+|\u2202S|, so |\u2202S|\u2261D|S| (mod 2), which is even since D is even.\nCorollary 5 (impossibility of cylinder-forcing a 1\u2011way bridge for even D in \u2264D). Work in X=G_{\\bullet,\u2264D} with D even. Suppose a cylinder refinement C(F\u2032) purportedly forces an edge e to be a bridge in every extension. Let S be the component (in F\u2032\u2212e) that is intended to be the finite side across e. If some vertex of S has deg_{F\u2032}(v)<D, then an extension may add a new neighbor of v outside the ball, creating an additional cross-edge and violating the bridge property. Hence every v\u2208S must satisfy deg_{F\u2032}(v)=D, contradicting Proposition 4. Thus no cylinder can force a bridge at bounded distance in \u2264D when D is even.\nComment. This does not rule out bridgeless being nowhere dense by some more delicate argument; it only forbids the sealed-bubble forcing for even D in \u2264D. It also explains why pendant-leaf forcing fails.\n\nTwo\u2011way infinite bridges are meagre (and dense)\nFor k\u2208\\mathbb{N}, let P_k be the set of graphs in X in which some 2\u2011way infinite bridge meets B_k (equivalently, there exists an edge e with both components of G\u2212e infinite and d(\u03c1,e)\u2264k).\nLemma 6. For any strongly local metric d on X and any D\u22653, each P_k is nowhere dense.\nProof. Fix a nonempty d-open set U and x\u2208U. Let \u03b5>0 with B_d(x,\u03b5)\u2282U and r=\u03c8(\u03b5)\u2265k. Let F=B_r(x). Consider the set E_k of edges of F whose distance to the root is \u2264k. Call e\u2208E_k safe if, in F\u2212e, at least one component contains no boundary vertex with residual capacity (<D); otherwise e is critical. In any completion of F, a safe e cannot be 2\u2011way infinite bridge (one side is necessarily finite). For the set S of boundary vertices with residual capacity in components of critical edges, adjoin for each v\u2208S one new vertex x_v at distance r+1 and add the edge vx_v. Connect the x_v\u2019s into a single simple cycle using additional new vertices placed at distance r+2 (degrees \u22642 so far). Let F\u2032 be the resulting (r+2)-ball; degrees in F\u2032 do not exceed D, and all edges e\u2208E_k now lie on a cycle contained in F\u2032. Therefore no extension of F\u2032 can contain a 2\u2011way infinite bridge meeting B_k. By Lemma 3, C(F\u2032)\u2260\\varnothing in \u2264D and in =D (odd); in =D (even) complete outside F\u2032 by attaching (D\u22121)-ary trees to all residual stubs as well. Hence U contains a smaller d-open set disjoint from P_k.\nLemma 7. For any D\u22653, P:=\u22c3_{k} P_k is dense.\nProof. Given any cylinder C(F), adjoin far away (beyond radius r+1) two disjoint infinite rays R_1,R_2 and connect their initial vertices by a single edge e, leaving degrees \u2264D and keeping the root-ball unchanged. In any completion, both sides of e are infinite, and e is a bridge. This yields a refinement cylinder contained in P.\nCorollary 8. For any strongly local metric on X and D\u22653, the set of graphs with a 2\u2011way infinite bridge is meagre and dense.\n\nConsequences for bridgeless typicality\n- Odd D (\u2264D and =D): By Lemma 2 and Lemma 1, \u201cbridgeless\u201d is nowhere dense (hence meagre) under any strongly local metric.\n- Even D, =D: 1\u2011way bridges are impossible by parity on a finite component; with Corollary 8, 2\u2011way bridges form a meagre set, so \u201cbridgeless\u201d is comeagre under any strongly local metric.\n- Even D, \u2264D: Sealed-bubble forcing is impossible (Corollary 5). The typicality of \u201cbridgeless\u201d under d_\\bullet remains open here; our method does not decide it. Note this casts doubt on the blanket statement \u201cbridgeless is nowhere dense in \u2264D for all D>2\u201d (in the extended abstract). If that claim is intended, it must proceed by a different argument than sealed saturation; we invite scrutiny for even D.\n\nExamples of strongly local metrics (Polish)\n- Weighted local metrics d_w: as above; cylinders are clopen, and d_w induces the product topology on the inverse system of finite r-balls.\n- FO-local metrics: Enumerate FO-types up to quantifier depth m around the root, weight by w_m\u21920; Gaifman locality gives the strongly local property. The topology is again a Polish subspace of a product of finite discrete spaces.\n\nNonlocal attempts and Baire issues\n- Adding global bridge-profile coordinates H_r (existence of a bridge meeting B_r) to define d_new=d_\\bullet+\u22112^{\u2212r\u22121}|H_r(x)\u2212H_r(y)| tends to make the bridge set open (hence not meagre) and breaks completeness: sequences pushing a single bridge farther out are Cauchy but have incompatible limits for H. Without proving Polish/Baire, such metrics are not \u201creasonable\u201d for typicality.\n\nObstacles\n- Even D, \u2264D: Establishing the actual category status of \u201cbridgeless\u201d under d_\\bullet. Our parity obstruction shows the standard sealed-bubble method cannot apply, but it does not preclude bridgeless being nowhere dense by a subtler construction or being comeagre.\n\nNext steps\n1) Even D, \u2264D: Either construct an explicit cylinder refinement that forces a 1\u2011way bridge without sealed saturation (unlikely), or prove an impossibility theorem: for D even, for every cylinder C(F) and every edge e within bounded distance, there exists an extension in which e lies on a cycle (hence no forcing). This would refute the claim of nowhere-denseness in even D for \u2264D.\n2) Formalize the shielding proof (Lemma 6) in full detail for both \u2264D and =D, including consistent degree bookkeeping at the boundary and completion via Lemma 3.\n3) Catalogue strongly local metrics (weighted local, ultrametrics from decorated balls, FO-local) and record Polishness; conclude invariant typicality for bridgeless in odd D and =D even.\n4) If pursuing a positive metric flip, first propose a nonlocal but Polish/Baire topology, then analyze whether bridgeless can be comeagre without making \u201chas a bridge\u201d open or killing Baire-ness.\n\nSummary\n- We proved a robust invariance scheme (Lemma 1) for strongly local metrics and used a sealed-bubble gadget (Lemma 2) plus a simple D-regular completion lemma (Lemma 3) to show bridgeless is meagre for odd D (\u2264D and =D) under any such metric. For =D with even D, bridgeless is comeagre, since 2\u2011way bridges are meagre (Corollary 8) and 1\u2011way bridges are impossible. For \u2264D with even D, sealed forcing is impossible by a parity obstruction (Proposition 4), leaving the category status open and calling for refined arguments. This narrows where a \u201cmetric sensitivity\u201d counterexample might exist and provides rigorous tools for the verifier to formalize in proofs.md."
