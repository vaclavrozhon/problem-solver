The key is to avoid prescribing the unique cross\u2011edge inside the ball when D is even; instead, force that exactly one cross\u2011edge must be added in any connected completion, by leaving exactly one vertex in the sealed bubble with spare capacity 1 (degree D\u22121 in the ball). This yields a bridge in every completion without contradicting parity.\\n- State and prove a general cylinder\u2011rich forcing lemma: in any topology where every open neighborhood contains a local cylinder, a property is nowhere dense once one can refine every cylinder to a smaller cylinder lying in the complement.\\n- Keep the odd\u2011regular (=D) case via the earlier \u201cexplicit cross\u2011edge in the ball\u201d gadget, and supply a regular completion lemma to realize the refined ball in an infinite D\u2011regular graph.\\n- Record that 2\u2011way infinite bridges are meagre (but dense), so for even D\u2011regular bridgeless is already comeagre under the local (and any equivalent cylinder\u2011rich) topology.\\n\\nCylinder\u2011rich forcing principle\\nDefinition (cylinder\u2011rich). A topology \u03c4 on X=\\\\mathbf G_{\\\\bullet,D} is cylinder\u2011rich if for every x\u2208X and every \u03c4\u2011open U\u2286X with x\u2208U there exists r such that the local cylinder C(B_r(x))\u2286U.\\nLemma CR. Let \u03c4 be cylinder\u2011rich. If for every local cylinder C(F) there exists a local cylinder C(F\u2032)\u2286C(F) with C(F\u2032)\u2229S=\u2205, then S is nowhere dense in (X,\u03c4).\\nProof. Given any nonempty \u03c4\u2011open U, pick a cylinder C(F)\u2286U, then C(F\u2032)\u2286U\\\\S by hypothesis. Hence every nonempty open set contains a nonempty open subset disjoint from S, so int_\u03c4(\\\\overline S)=\u2205.\\n\\nForcing a bridge in \u2264D for all D>2\\nLemma 1 (sealed bubble with one spare stub). Fix D>2. For any nonempty cylinder C(F) in \\\\mathbf G_{\\\\bullet,\\\\le D}, there exists a larger radius r\u2032 and a cylinder C(F\u2032)\u2286C(F) such that every (G,\u03c1)\u2208C(F\u2032) contains a bridge.\\nProof. Let r be the radius of F and choose a boundary vertex b\u2208L_r(F) with deg_F(b)<D (this exists since C(F) has infinite extensions). Inside the (yet to be) enlarged ball, build a finite connected \u201cbubble\u201d S disjoint from B_r(F) and attach it to b by no edges at this stage. Construct S so that every v\u2208S\\\\{z} has degree D inside the enlarged ball, and a designated vertex z\u2208S has degree D\u22121 inside the enlarged ball; ensure no edges leave S within the ball. This is possible by taking any finite connected simple graph S_0 with max degree \u2264D and then \u201cD\u2011regularizing\u201d S_0\\\\{z} inside the ball via finite filler gadgets while keeping deg(z)=D\u22121; standard degree\u2011sequence realization (Erd\u0151s\u2013Gallai) plus the usual edge\u2011switching argument yields such a finite connected filler. Also leave elsewhere on the boundary of the enlarged ball some vertex u with residual capacity <D to admit infinite completions (so C(F\u2032) is nonempty).\\nNow set F\u2032 to be the ball up to radius r+R containing S and b, still with no edge between S and B_r(F). Consider any completion (G,\u03c1)\u2208C(F\u2032). Because G is connected, there must be at least one edge between S and V(G)\\\\S. All vertices of S\\\\{z} already have degree D in G (they cannot receive new edges without violating \u0394\u2264D), so any such cross\u2011edge must be incident with z. But deg_{F\u2032}(z)=D\u22121, hence z can accept at most one new edge in G (else \u0394> D). Therefore exactly one edge crosses \u03b4(S) in G. Consequently, that unique edge e is a bridge in G (its removal disconnects S from the rest). Thus every graph in C(F\u2032) contains a bridge.\\nRemark (parity). The construction avoids prescribing the cross\u2011edge inside the ball when D is even, so there is no parity obstruction: the single cross\u2011edge is forced by connectivity and capacity, not by preplacing a cut of size 1.\\nCorollary 2. In any cylinder\u2011rich topology on \\\\mathbf G_{\\\\bullet,\\\\le D} with D>2, the set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense.\\n\\nOdd D\u2011regular forcing and completion\\nLemma 3 (odd\u2011regular bridge forcing in a cylinder). Let D=2t+1>2. For any nonempty cylinder C(F) in \\\\mathbf G_{\\\\bullet,=D} there exists a cylinder C(F\u2032)\u2286C(F) such that every (G,\u03c1)\u2208C(F\u2032) has a bridge.\\nConstruction and proof. Use the earlier gadget: choose b\u2208L_r(F) with deg_F(b)<D, add a path b\u2013y\u2013z at larger radius, and attach a finite connected graph H with all vertices D\u2011regular except z having degree D\u22121, then include yz inside the ball so deg(z)=D. Saturate degrees of all new vertices inside the ball to D, and ensure no other edge links H to the old part besides by. Let S:=V(H)\u222a{y}. In any D\u2011regular completion of C(F\u2032), every vertex of S has degree D already within the ball, and \u03b4(S)\u2229E(B_{r\u2032})={by}. As in Lemma 1, no new edges can leave S, hence |\u03b4(S)|=1 and by is a bridge in all completions.\\nLemma 4 (odd D\u2011regular infinite completion). The refined ball F\u2032 in Lemma 3 admits an infinite connected D\u2011regular simple completion.\\nProof. Let T be the infinite D\u2011regular tree. Choose finitely many pairwise distant vertices in T, delete at most one incident edge at each to free one stub per chosen vertex, and pair the finite multiset of \u201cfree stubs\u201d outside the ball so that all degrees become D again. Then identify the finitely many residual boundary stubs of F\u2032 bijectively with those free stubs in T. This yields a simple, connected, infinite D\u2011regular completion. Standard \u201cswitching\u201d avoids multiple edges by the distant choice.\\nCorollary 5. In any cylinder\u2011rich topology on \\\\mathbf G_{\\\\bullet,=D} with odd D>2, bridgeless is nowhere dense.\\n\\nTwo\u2011way infinite bridges are meagre (but dense)\\nFor k\u2208\\\\mathbb N, let P_k be the set of rooted graphs having a 2\u2011way infinite bridge at distance \u2264k from the root.\\nLemma 6 (P_k is nowhere dense, \u2264D). Fix D>2 and k. Given any cylinder C(F) with radius r\u2265k, refine to C(F\u2032)\u2286C(F) as follows. Let E_k be the finite set of edges of F at midpoint distance \u2264k. For each e\u2208E_k, if in F\u2212e at least one side has no boundary vertex of residual capacity (<D), then e can never become 2\u2011way in any extension; ignore it. For the remaining e, pick boundary vertices v_A,v_B on the two sides with residual capacity. In F\u2032 enlarge the ball by adding new neighbors s_A^e,s_B^e to v_A,v_B (consuming 1 unit of capacity) and connect s_A^e to s_B^e via a single outside vertex c_e, creating a cycle through e entirely within the enlarged ball; do this disjointly for different e. This preserves \u0394\u2264D. Then no e\u2208E_k can be a bridge in any completion of C(F\u2032), hence P_k is avoided. The same works in =D after locally saturating used boundary vertices to degree D with small fillers. Thus P_k is nowhere dense in \\\\mathbf G_{\\\\bullet,D}.\\nProposition 7 (2\u2011way bridges are meagre and dense). P:=\\\\bigcup_k P_k is meagre. It is dense because, in any cylinder, one can attach far away a double ray and connect it to the core by a single edge without affecting the inner ball.\\nCorollary 8 (even\u2011regular case). In \\\\mathbf G_{\\\\bullet,=D} with even D>2, every bridge is 2\u2011way infinite (parity). Hence the set of bridged graphs is meagre, so bridgeless is comeagre under the local (and any equivalent cylinder\u2011rich) topology.\\n\\nNatural alternative metrics\\n- Weighted local metrics d_a generated by summable positive weights on r\u2011ball disagreements induce exactly the local topology; they are cylinder\u2011rich (proof sketched earlier). FO\u2011local metrics on bounded\u2011degree classes are cylinder\u2011rich by Gaifman locality. Thus typicality (meagre/comeagre/nowhere dense) coincides with the local metric for these natural alternatives.\\n- By Lemma CR and the forcing above, within any cylinder\u2011rich topology: bridgeless is nowhere dense in \u2264D (all D>2) and in =D (odd D>2). In even D\u2011regular, bridgeless is already comeagre.\\n\\nExamples\\n- \u2264D, D=4: From any cylinder, build S with all vertices degree 4 in the ball except z of degree 3, no cross\u2011edge in the ball. Every connected completion must add exactly one edge from z to the outside, yielding a 1\u2011way bridge.\\n- =3\u2011regular: Use the path b\u2013y\u2013z and an H with deg(z)=2, others 3, saturate inside the ball; by is then a bridge in all completions; infinite 3\u2011regular completions exist by Lemma 4.\\n\\nObstacles and checks\\n- The parity obstruction is now handled correctly: for \u2264D with even D we do not preplace the single cross\u2011edge; connectivity forces it, with unique capacity at z.\\n- We avoided the false \u201cnowhere dense preserved under refinement\u201d claim by working under the cylinder\u2011rich hypothesis and using Lemma CR.\\n- The regular completion lemma is constructive; a more detailed switching proof can be supplied if needed.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Package the finite \u201cD\u2011regularization inside a ball\u201d filler used in Lemma 1 into a crisp lemma: given any finite seed with max degree \u2264D and a designated vertex z, one can add finitely many vertices/edges inside the ball to make all vertices except possibly z attain degree D while keeping the graph connected; provide a short proof via Erd\u0151s\u2013Gallai plus connectivity by switchings.\\n- Formalize that weighted\u2011local and FO\u2011local metrics are Polish and cylinder\u2011rich; record that typical sets agree with the Benjamini\u2013Schramm metric.\\n- If searching for a metric changing typicality, move beyond cylinder\u2011rich: develop an end\u2011profile inverse\u2011limit topology and test whether \u201cno one\u2011edge cut across any finite S\u201d becomes comeagre; first establish Baire/metrizability.\"}",
