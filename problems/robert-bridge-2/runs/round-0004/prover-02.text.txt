Ideas
- Close the main technical gap: give a clean, parity‑correct “sealed bubble” forcing that works in ≤D for all D>2 (including even D). The key is to avoid prescribing the unique cross‑edge inside the ball when D is even; instead, force that exactly one cross‑edge must be added in any connected completion, by leaving exactly one vertex in the sealed bubble with spare capacity 1 (degree D−1 in the ball). This yields a bridge in every completion without contradicting parity.
- State and prove a general cylinder‑rich forcing lemma: in any topology where every open neighborhood contains a local cylinder, a property is nowhere dense once one can refine every cylinder to a smaller cylinder lying in the complement.
- Keep the odd‑regular (=D) case via the earlier “explicit cross‑edge in the ball” gadget, and supply a regular completion lemma to realize the refined ball in an infinite D‑regular graph.
- Record that 2‑way infinite bridges are meagre (but dense), so for even D‑regular bridgeless is already comeagre under the local (and any equivalent cylinder‑rich) topology.

Cylinder‑rich forcing principle
Definition (cylinder‑rich). A topology τ on X=\mathbf G_{\bullet,D} is cylinder‑rich if for every x∈X and every τ‑open U⊆X with x∈U there exists r such that the local cylinder C(B_r(x))⊆U.
Lemma CR. Let τ be cylinder‑rich. If for every local cylinder C(F) there exists a local cylinder C(F′)⊆C(F) with C(F′)∩S=∅, then S is nowhere dense in (X,τ).
Proof. Given any nonempty τ‑open U, pick a cylinder C(F)⊆U, then C(F′)⊆U\S by hypothesis. Hence every nonempty open set contains a nonempty open subset disjoint from S, so int_τ(\overline S)=∅.

Forcing a bridge in ≤D for all D>2
Lemma 1 (sealed bubble with one spare stub). Fix D>2. For any nonempty cylinder C(F) in \mathbf G_{\bullet,\le D}, there exists a larger radius r′ and a cylinder C(F′)⊆C(F) such that every (G,ρ)∈C(F′) contains a bridge.
Proof. Let r be the radius of F and choose a boundary vertex b∈L_r(F) with deg_F(b)<D (this exists since C(F) has infinite extensions). Inside the (yet to be) enlarged ball, build a finite connected “bubble” S disjoint from B_r(F) and attach it to b by no edges at this stage. Construct S so that every v∈S\{z} has degree D inside the enlarged ball, and a designated vertex z∈S has degree D−1 inside the enlarged ball; ensure no edges leave S within the ball. This is possible by taking any finite connected simple graph S_0 with max degree ≤D and then “D‑regularizing” S_0\{z} inside the ball via finite filler gadgets while keeping deg(z)=D−1; standard degree‑sequence realization (Erdős–Gallai) plus the usual edge‑switching argument yields such a finite connected filler. Also leave elsewhere on the boundary of the enlarged ball some vertex u with residual capacity <D to admit infinite completions (so C(F′) is nonempty).
Now set F′ to be the ball up to radius r+R containing S and b, still with no edge between S and B_r(F). Consider any completion (G,ρ)∈C(F′). Because G is connected, there must be at least one edge between S and V(G)\S. All vertices of S\{z} already have degree D in G (they cannot receive new edges without violating Δ≤D), so any such cross‑edge must be incident with z. But deg_{F′}(z)=D−1, hence z can accept at most one new edge in G (else Δ> D). Therefore exactly one edge crosses δ(S) in G. Consequently, that unique edge e is a bridge in G (its removal disconnects S from the rest). Thus every graph in C(F′) contains a bridge.
Remark (parity). The construction avoids prescribing the cross‑edge inside the ball when D is even, so there is no parity obstruction: the single cross‑edge is forced by connectivity and capacity, not by preplacing a cut of size 1.
Corollary 2. In any cylinder‑rich topology on \mathbf G_{\bullet,\le D} with D>2, the set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense.

Odd D‑regular forcing and completion
Lemma 3 (odd‑regular bridge forcing in a cylinder). Let D=2t+1>2. For any nonempty cylinder C(F) in \mathbf G_{\bullet,=D} there exists a cylinder C(F′)⊆C(F) such that every (G,ρ)∈C(F′) has a bridge.
Construction and proof. Use the earlier gadget: choose b∈L_r(F) with deg_F(b)<D, add a path b–y–z at larger radius, and attach a finite connected graph H with all vertices D‑regular except z having degree D−1, then include yz inside the ball so deg(z)=D. Saturate degrees of all new vertices inside the ball to D, and ensure no other edge links H to the old part besides by. Let S:=V(H)∪{y}. In any D‑regular completion of C(F′), every vertex of S has degree D already within the ball, and δ(S)∩E(B_{r′})={by}. As in Lemma 1, no new edges can leave S, hence |δ(S)|=1 and by is a bridge in all completions.
Lemma 4 (odd D‑regular infinite completion). The refined ball F′ in Lemma 3 admits an infinite connected D‑regular simple completion.
Proof. Let T be the infinite D‑regular tree. Choose finitely many pairwise distant vertices in T, delete at most one incident edge at each to free one stub per chosen vertex, and pair the finite multiset of “free stubs” outside the ball so that all degrees become D again. Then identify the finitely many residual boundary stubs of F′ bijectively with those free stubs in T. This yields a simple, connected, infinite D‑regular completion. Standard “switching” avoids multiple edges by the distant choice.
Corollary 5. In any cylinder‑rich topology on \mathbf G_{\bullet,=D} with odd D>2, bridgeless is nowhere dense.

Two‑way infinite bridges are meagre (but dense)
For k∈\mathbb N, let P_k be the set of rooted graphs having a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance ≤k from the root.
Lemma 6 (P_k is nowhere dense, ≤D). Fix D>2 and k. Given any cylinder C(F) with radius r≥k, refine to C(F′)⊆C(F) as follows. Let E_k be the finite set of edges of F at midpoint distance ≤k. For each e∈E_k, if in F−e at least one side has no boundary vertex of residual capacity (<D), then e can never become 2‑way in any extension; ignore it. For the remaining e, pick boundary vertices v_A,v_B on the two sides with residual capacity. In F′ enlarge the ball by adding new neighbors s_A^e,s_B^e to v_A,v_B (consuming 1 unit of capacity) and connect s_A^e to s_B^e via a single outside vertex c_e, creating a cycle through e entirely within the enlarged ball; do this disjointly for different e. This preserves Δ≤D. Then no e∈E_k can be a bridge in any completion of C(F′), hence P_k is avoided. The same works in =D after locally saturating used boundary vertices to degree D with small fillers. Thus P_k is nowhere dense in \mathbf G_{\bullet,D}.
Proposition 7 (2‑way bridges are meagre and dense). P:=\bigcup_k P_k is meagre. It is dense because, in any cylinder, one can attach far away a double ray and connect it to the core by a single edge without affecting the inner ball.
Corollary 8 (even‑regular case). In \mathbf G_{\bullet,=D} with even D>2, every bridge is 2‑way infinite (parity). Hence the set of bridged graphs is meagre, so bridgeless is comeagre under the local (and any equivalent cylinder‑rich) topology.

Natural alternative metrics
- Weighted local metrics d_a generated by summable positive weights on r‑ball disagreements induce exactly the local topology; they are cylinder‑rich (proof sketched earlier). FO‑local metrics on bounded‑degree classes are cylinder‑rich by Gaifman locality. Thus typicality (meagre/comeagre/nowhere dense) coincides with the local metric for these natural alternatives.
- By Lemma CR and the forcing above, within any cylinder‑rich topology: bridgeless is nowhere dense in ≤D (all D>2) and in =D (odd D>2). In even D‑regular, bridgeless is already comeagre.

Examples
- ≤D, D=4: From any cylinder, build S with all vertices degree 4 in the ball except z of degree 3, no cross‑edge in the ball. Every connected completion must add exactly one edge from z to the outside, yielding a 1‑way bridge.
- =3‑regular: Use the path b–y–z and an H with deg(z)=2, others 3, saturate inside the ball; by is then a bridge in all completions; infinite 3‑regular completions exist by Lemma 4.

Obstacles and checks
- The parity obstruction is now handled correctly: for ≤D with even D we do not preplace the single cross‑edge; connectivity forces it, with unique capacity at z.
- We avoided the false “nowhere dense preserved under refinement” claim by working under the cylinder‑rich hypothesis and using Lemma CR.
- The regular completion lemma is constructive; a more detailed switching proof can be supplied if needed.

Next steps
- Package the finite “D‑regularization inside a ball” filler used in Lemma 1 into a crisp lemma: given any finite seed with max degree ≤D and a designated vertex z, one can add finitely many vertices/edges inside the ball to make all vertices except possibly z attain degree D while keeping the graph connected; provide a short proof via Erdős–Gallai plus connectivity by switchings.
- Formalize that weighted‑local and FO‑local metrics are Polish and cylinder‑rich; record that typical sets agree with the Benjamini–Schramm metric.
- If searching for a metric changing typicality, move beyond cylinder‑rich: develop an end‑profile inverse‑limit topology and test whether “no one‑edge cut across any finite S” becomes comeagre; first establish Baire/metrizability.
