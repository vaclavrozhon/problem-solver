I point out errors/gaps and supply precise lemmas and proofs where feasible.\\n\\nFoundations: cylinders and closure (fix Lemma 13)\\n- Cylinders are clopen in the local topology. If F is a realized r\u2011ball and x_n \u2208 G_\u2022^F with x_n \u2192 x in d_\u2022, then for s \u2264 r one has B_s(x_n) \u2245 B_s(x) eventually, hence B_r(x) \u2245 F and x \u2208 G_\u2022^F. Thus G_\u2022^F is closed. It is open by definition.\\n- Correct nowhere\u2011dense criterion via cylinders. A set S is nowhere dense iff for every realized cylinder G_\u2022^F there exists a realized cylinder G_\u2022^{F\u2032} \u2286 G_\u2022^F with G_\u2022^{F\u2032} \u2229 cl(S) = \u2205. In all arguments below we construct G_\u2022^{F\u2032} with G_\u2022^{F\u2032} \u2286 X \\\\ S, which is stronger (and implies disjointness from the closure automatically since G_\u2022^{F\u2032} is open).\\n- Nonemptiness of cylinders in G_{\u2022,\u2264D}. For a realized r\u2011ball F in G_{\u2022,\u2264D}, some boundary vertex v \u2208 L_r(F) must satisfy deg_F(v) < D; otherwise no infinite extension is possible. Conversely, if there is boundary residual capacity, an infinite extension exists by attaching a (\u2264 D) tree. This sharpens the \u201cnonempty if a boundary vertex has residual degree\u201d bullet in Lemma 13.\\n- Distance of an edge. Please define dist(\u03c1,e) = min{dist(\u03c1,u): u incident with e}. Later properties \u201cedge at distance \u2264 k\u201d should be stated with this precise convention, and when we say \u201ce \u2208 B_k\u201d we mean both endpoints lie in B_k.\\n\\nParity obstruction for single\u2011edge cuts at even D\\nLemma (parity). Let D be even. In any graph G and any finite vertex set S for which every v \u2208 S has deg_G(v) = D, the edge boundary |\u2202S| is even. In particular, |\u2202S| = 1 is impossible.\\nProof. Sum of degrees in S equals D|S|, which is even. Also \u2211_{v\u2208S} deg_G(v) = 2|E(S)| + |\u2202S|. Since 2|E(S)| is even, |\u2202S| is even.\\nCorollaries.\\n- In D\u2011regular graphs with even D, 1\u2011way infinite bridges cannot exist.\\n- In \u2264 D spaces with even D, any attempt to force a bridge by sealing a finite component S so that all vertices in S have degree D in the resulting infinite graphs is impossible if the cut has size 1. Hence any robust \u201cdegree\u2011saturation\u201d forcing of a 1\u2011edge cut fails in this case.\\n\\nRobust bridge forcing: correct construction and its scope\\nIssue in the write\u2011up. Theorem 14\u2019s pendant\u2011leaf argument is invalid: extensions may attach new edges at the leaf, destroying bridgelessness in the limit or in other completions. One must block all additional exits from the \u201cbubble side.\u201d\\n\\nLemma (sealed finite bubble, \u2264 D; odd D\u2011regular). Fix D \u2265 2. Let X be G_{\u2022,\u2264D}, or G_{\u2022,=D} with D odd. For any realized cylinder G_\u2022^F (radius r) and for any boundary vertex u \u2208 L_r(F) with deg_F(u) \u2264 D \u2212 1, there exist R > r and a realized cylinder G_\u2022^{F\u2032} \u2286 G_\u2022^{F} such that every (G,\u03c1) \u2208 G_\u2022^{F\u2032} has a bridge e incident with u.\\nProof (construction and verification).\\n- Build a finite connected \u201cbubble\u201d H outside B_r with a designated vertex w (disjoint from B_r). Choose H so that every vertex of H except w has degree D within the induced subgraph on B_R, and w has degree D \u2212 1 within H. Add a single edge e = uw. After adding e, every vertex of H has degree D within B_R. Thus, in any completion with B_R fixed, no vertex of H can acquire additional edges (\u2264 D constraint; in =D we require exactly D). Hence across the cut (V(H), V(G) \\\\ V(H)) there is exactly one edge, e, so e is a bridge.\\n- Nonemptiness: when defining F\u2032 = B_R, leave at least one vertex on L_R(F\u2032) with residual capacity so that infinite extensions exist. In the =D case (odd D), we can ensure D\u2011regular completions by attaching outside disjoint D\u2011regular trees along the remaining stubs.\\n- Parity restriction: this forcing is impossible in G_{\u2022,=D} for even D (and, by the parity lemma, also impossible for \u2264 D if all bubble vertices are saturated to D). Thus the lemma is stated only for \u2264 D (all D) and for = D with odd D.\\n\\nExplicit odd\u2011regular bubble\\nConstruction H for odd D \u2265 3. Let m = D + 2 (odd). Start with K_m. Remove the edges of a Hamiltonian cycle C_m to reduce every vertex\u2019s degree from m \u2212 1 = D + 1 to D \u2212 1. In K_m \\\\ E(C_m) choose a maximum matching M that leaves a prescribed vertex w unmatched (possible because m is odd). Adding M increases the degree of matched vertices by 1, yielding degree D for all matched vertices, while deg(w) = D \u2212 1. The resulting simple, connected H has the required degree sequence. Using H in the sealed\u2011bubble lemma gives Theorem 14(ii) rigorously for odd D.\\n\\nTwo\u2011way infinite bridges: meagre and dense (Theorem 16, completed)\\nWe now supply a complete proof that the set of graphs with a 2\u2011way infinite bridge is meagre but dense in G_{\u2022,D} for every D > 2, in both \u2264 D and = D.\\n\\nDefinition. For k \u2208 N, let P_k be the set of rooted graphs that have a 2\u2011way infinite bridge e with dist(\u03c1,e) \u2264 k and both endpoints of e in B_k.\\n\\nClaim 1: P_k is nowhere dense. Let G_\u2022^{F} be any realized cylinder with radius r \u2265 k. Consider the finite set E_k of edges of F with both endpoints in B_k. For e \u2208 E_k, write F \u2212 e as A \u222a B. Call e critical if both A and B contain at least one boundary vertex v \u2208 L_r(F) with deg_F(v) < D; otherwise e is safe.\\n- If e is safe, say A has no boundary vertex with residual capacity. In any completion of F to an infinite graph with the same r\u2011ball (hence no edges incident to A\u2019s boundary vertices can be added inside B_r), the component corresponding to A remains finite. Therefore e cannot be a 2\u2011way infinite bridge in any such completion (even though it might be a 1\u2011way bridge).\\n- For the finitely many critical edges, choose a set S \u2286 L_r(F) that contains one residual boundary vertex from each side of each critical e. Outside B_r attach, for each v \u2208 S, a new vertex x_v adjacent to v. Connect the x_v into a single simple cycle C that lies entirely outside B_r. Let H be this finite extension and set F\u2032 = B_{r+2}(H). Then for every critical e = ab, there exists v_A \u2208 S in A and v_B \u2208 S in B and paths in F \u2212 e from a to v_A and from b to v_B. The external cycle provides a path from v_A to v_B outside B_r. Thus there is a cycle through e lying entirely in B_{r+2}(H), and e is not a bridge in any completion that preserves B_{r+2}. Therefore G_\u2022^{F\u2032} \u2286 G_\u2022^{F} \\\\ P_k. Nonemptiness: reserve at least one fresh boundary stub (possibly by adding an extra vertex y beyond C with degree < D) to permit infinite completions; in = D one later fills stubs outside B_{r+2} to ensure D\u2011regularity.\\nHence P_k is nowhere dense.\\n\\nClaim 2: \u22c3_{k} P_k (the set of graphs with a 2\u2011way infinite bridge) is meagre. Immediate by countable union of nowhere dense sets (Claim 1).\\n\\nClaim 3: \u22c3_{k} P_k is dense. Let G_\u2022^{F} be any realized cylinder (radius r). There is some boundary vertex u with deg_F(u) < D in \u2264 D; in = D, there exists at least one boundary stub across the entire boundary counting multiplicity of deficit to D. Build outside B_r two disjoint, infinite D\u2011bounded trees T_1 and T_2 (or D\u2011regular trees in the = D case once all local degrees are filled), and connect them by a single edge e far beyond radius r+1. Join u to T_1 by a long path (and optionally another boundary vertex to T_2 by a long path) so that B_r remains unchanged. Then e is a 2\u2011way infinite bridge in the resulting graph. Thus every cylinder intersects \u22c3_{k} P_k, proving density.\\nConclusion. The set of graphs with a 2\u2011way infinite bridge is dense meagre.\\n\\nConsequences for typicality by parity\\nCorollary (even D regular). In G_{\u2022,=D} with even D, every bridge is 2\u2011way infinite (parity). Therefore the set \u201chas a bridge\u201d is meagre (by the meagreness of 2\u2011way bridges), and the complement \u201cbridgeless\u201d is comeagre (typical) in the standard local topology.\\n\\nScope and limits of Theorem 14(i)\\n- Odd D (\u2264 D and = D): The sealed\u2011bubble forcing provides, inside any cylinder, a subcylinder on which every graph has a bridge. Thus the set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense in these spaces. This part of Theorem 14 is recoverable with full rigor.\\n- Even D, = D: The same forcing cannot work (parity obstruction). Combined with the previous corollary, bridgeless is actually comeagre in this case, so the correct statement is the opposite of \u201cnowhere dense.\u201d\\n- Even D, \u2264 D: The current proof sketch \u201cattach a leaf\u201d is invalid, and the sealed\u2011bubble method is blocked by the parity lemma if one tries to robustly forbid extra exits from the finite side. I see no alternative robust forcing in the local topology that would make \u201chas a bridge\u201d unavoidable in all completions. This casts serious doubt on Theorem 14(i) \u201cfor all D > 2\u201d in the \u2264 D setting when D is even. I recommend either restricting (i) to odd D or proving an impossibility claim: no r\u2032\u2011ball can force a bridge in all completions when D is even (a plausible lemma: any would\u2011be bridge can be neutralized by adding an external bypass using residual capacity on the finite side). At minimum, mark even D in \u2264 D as open pending a correct argument.\\n\\nTheorem 15 (no cut vertex nowhere dense): status and fix\\n- For all D \u2265 2 (both \u2264 D and = D), one can force a cut vertex robustly by taking two finite connected \u201cblobs\u201d whose vertices are saturated to degree D within the ball (in = D exact; in \u2264 D at most D), identifying them at a single articulation vertex v (whose degree within the ball can be less than D), and ensuring all blob vertices other than v have no residual capacity within the ball. In any completion preserving the ball, no bypass edges between blobs can be added (blob vertices are saturated within the ball), hence v is a cut vertex in every completion. This supplies the missing details for Theorem 15.\\n\\nTheorem 17 (edge\u2011chromatic number): current argument invalid\\n- The claim \u201cremoving an edge preserves \u03c7\u2032 = D + 1 by parity\u201d is false in general (e.g., K_3). To prove \u201c\u03c7\u2032 = D is nowhere dense,\u201d one needs a finite class\u2011II forcer H_D (\u03c7\u2032(H_D) = D + 1) that remains a class\u2011II obstruction under supergraphs, plus an embedding lemma that respects degree budgets inside the cylinder. Candidates: for even D, overfull subgraphs (|E(H)| > \u230aD|V(H)|/2\u230b) force class II; for odd D, odd\u2011order D\u2011regular graphs. The write\u2011up should either supply such a forcer and a rigorous local embedding argument (saturate H_D\u2011side within the ball) or mark this theorem as open.\\n\\nTopology/metric sensitivity: what can and cannot change\\n- Typicality is a topological notion. Equivalent metrics yield identical typical sets. To transfer the sealed\u2011bubble forcing argument to alternative metrics/topologies, it suffices that the alternative topology \u03c4 contains all local cylinders as open sets (call such \u03c4 cylinder\u2011open). Then, given any \u03c4\u2011open set U, choose a cylinder G_\u2022^F \u2286 U, and refine to a subcylinder G_\u2022^{F\u2032} on which every graph has a bridge (odd D cases), proving that the bridgeless set is nowhere dense in \u03c4 as well.\\n- Even D, = D: bridgeless is comeagre already in the local topology, hence in any equivalent/cylinder\u2011open metric.\\n- Caution. Do not claim any monotonicity of meagreness/no\u2011where\u2011denseness under arbitrary refinements/coarsenings. For coarser topologies, \u03c4\u2032\u2011dense open sets need not be dense in \u03c4; nowhere\u2011denseness also behaves non\u2011monotonically. Only explicit forcing inside open basic sets is safe.\\n- Nonlocal candidates. If one seeks a metric where bridgeless becomes typical in the odd\u2011D or \u2264 D cases, the topology must not be cylinder\u2011open. E.g., topologies that can enforce \u201cforbid attachments\u201d at designated boundary vertices (your \u201ctame\u201d A(F,\u03a0) with forbiddances) are strictly finer and might alter typicality, but require proofs of Polishness/Baire property. Before pursuing, formalize A(F,\u03a0), verify separability/completeness/Baire, and then revisit bridge density.\\n\\nExamples and sanity checks\\n- Pendant\u2011leaf counterexample. In \u2264 D, attach a leaf at u inside the ball. In a completion, add two disjoint long paths from the leaf vertex to distant vertices and connect their endpoints via an edge beyond the ball; the original leaf\u2011edge lies on a cycle in this completion and is not a bridge. Thus \u201cattach a leaf\u201d is not a robust forcer.\\n- Explicit cubic bubble (D = 3). Using K_5, remove a 5\u2011cycle, add a matching leaving w unmatched to get degrees (3,3,3,3,2); then add the cut edge e = uw. Place this gadget outside the given ball as per the sealed\u2011bubble lemma to force a bridge in G_{\u2022,=3}.\\n\\nActionable next steps\\n1) Amend Lemma 13: insert closure where needed, and add the clopen cylinder fact with a short proof.\\n2) Replace Theorem 14\u2019s leaf argument with the sealed\u2011bubble forcing. State Theorem 14 precisely as: (a) in G_{\u2022,=D} with odd D and in G_{\u2022,\u2264D} with odd D, bridgeless is nowhere dense; (b) in G_{\u2022,=D} with even D, bridgeless is comeagre; (c) in G_{\u2022,\u2264D} with even D, the status is open (or supply a correct forcing, if any).\\n3) Insert the full proof that \u201c2\u2011way infinite bridges\u201d form a dense meagre set (Claims 1\u20133 above), and explicitly define \u201cedge at distance \u2264 k.\u201d\\n4) Provide an explicit odd\u2011D bubble H (the K_{D+2} \u2212 C + M construction) with a short proof, and a D\u2011regular completion lemma to ensure nonemptiness of the refined cylinder.\\n5) Either supply a finite class\u2011II forcer and embedding lemma for Theorem 17 or mark it as an open problem.\\n6) State a topology invariance lemma for any cylinder\u2011open alternative metric: in such topologies, the odd\u2011D negative result for bridgeless typicality persists and the even\u2011D regular positive result persists.\\n\\nConclusion\\n- With the corrected sealed\u2011bubble forcing, bridgeless is nowhere dense in the odd\u2011D settings (\u2264 D and = D). The set of graphs with a 2\u2011way infinite bridge is dense meagre for all D > 2, yielding that bridgeless is comeagre in = D with even D. The current claim that bridgeless is nowhere dense in \u2264 D for all D > 2 is unsupported for even D; parity blocks any robust 1\u2011edge cut forcing, and a different valid argument is needed or the statement should be restricted. Theorem 17 requires a new proof or retraction. Finally, under any cylinder\u2011open alternative metric, these typicality conclusions remain unchanged; a change in typicality, if possible, must come from a genuinely nonlocal topology, whose Baire/Polish status and density properties remain to be established.\"}",
