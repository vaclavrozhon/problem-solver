Scope
I audit the current write‑up for correctness and completeness, focusing on: (i) foundational topological facts (cylinders, closure), (ii) the bridge‑forcing mechanisms (and their limits), (iii) the meagreness/density of 2‑way infinite bridges, (iv) metric/topology sensitivity, and (v) the edge‑chromatic claim. I point out errors/gaps and supply precise lemmas and proofs where feasible.

Foundations: cylinders and closure (fix Lemma 13)
- Cylinders are clopen in the local topology. If F is a realized r‑ball and x_n ∈ G_•^F with x_n → x in d_•, then for s ≤ r one has B_s(x_n) ≅ B_s(x) eventually, hence B_r(x) ≅ F and x ∈ G_•^F. Thus G_•^F is closed. It is open by definition.
- Correct nowhere‑dense criterion via cylinders. A set S is nowhere dense iff for every realized cylinder G_•^F there exists a realized cylinder G_•^{F′} ⊆ G_•^F with G_•^{F′} ∩ cl(S) = ∅. In all arguments below we construct G_•^{F′} with G_•^{F′} ⊆ X \ S, which is stronger (and implies disjointness from the closure automatically since G_•^{F′} is open).
- Nonemptiness of cylinders in G_{•,≤D}. For a realized r‑ball F in G_{•,≤D}, some boundary vertex v ∈ L_r(F) must satisfy deg_F(v) < D; otherwise no infinite extension is possible. Conversely, if there is boundary residual capacity, an infinite extension exists by attaching a (≤ D) tree. This sharpens the “nonempty if a boundary vertex has residual degree” bullet in Lemma 13.
- Distance of an edge. Please define dist(ρ,e) = min{dist(ρ,u): u incident with e}. Later properties “edge at distance ≤ k” should be stated with this precise convention, and when we say “e ∈ B_k” we mean both endpoints lie in B_k.

Parity obstruction for single‑edge cuts at even D
Lemma (parity). Let D be even. In any graph G and any finite vertex set S for which every v ∈ S has deg_G(v) = D, the edge boundary |∂S| is even. In particular, |∂S| = 1 is impossible.
Proof. Sum of degrees in S equals D|S|, which is even. Also ∑_{v∈S} deg_G(v) = 2|E(S)| + |∂S|. Since 2|E(S)| is even, |∂S| is even.
Corollaries.
- In D‑regular graphs with even D, 1‑way infinite bridges cannot exist.
- In ≤ D spaces with even D, any attempt to force a bridge by sealing a finite component S so that all vertices in S have degree D in the resulting infinite graphs is impossible if the cut has size 1. Hence any robust “degree‑saturation” forcing of a 1‑edge cut fails in this case.

Robust bridge forcing: correct construction and its scope
Issue in the write‑up. Theorem 14’s pendant‑leaf argument is invalid: extensions may attach new edges at the leaf, destroying bridgelessness in the limit or in other completions. One must block all additional exits from the “bubble side.”

Lemma (sealed finite bubble, ≤ D; odd D‑regular). Fix D ≥ 2. Let X be G_{•,≤D}, or G_{•,=D} with D odd. For any realized cylinder G_•^F (radius r) and for any boundary vertex u ∈ L_r(F) with deg_F(u) ≤ D − 1, there exist R > r and a realized cylinder G_•^{F′} ⊆ G_•^{F} such that every (G,ρ) ∈ G_•^{F′} has a bridge e incident with u.
Proof (construction and verification).
- Build a finite connected “bubble” H outside B_r with a designated vertex w (disjoint from B_r). Choose H so that every vertex of H except w has degree D within the induced subgraph on B_R, and w has degree D − 1 within H. Add a single edge e = uw. After adding e, every vertex of H has degree D within B_R. Thus, in any completion with B_R fixed, no vertex of H can acquire additional edges (≤ D constraint; in =D we require exactly D). Hence across the cut (V(H), V(G) \ V(H)) there is exactly one edge, e, so e is a bridge.
- Nonemptiness: when defining F′ = B_R, leave at least one vertex on L_R(F′) with residual capacity so that infinite extensions exist. In the =D case (odd D), we can ensure D‑regular completions by attaching outside disjoint D‑regular trees along the remaining stubs.
- Parity restriction: this forcing is impossible in G_{•,=D} for even D (and, by the parity lemma, also impossible for ≤ D if all bubble vertices are saturated to D). Thus the lemma is stated only for ≤ D (all D) and for = D with odd D.

Explicit odd‑regular bubble
Construction H for odd D ≥ 3. Let m = D + 2 (odd). Start with K_m. Remove the edges of a Hamiltonian cycle C_m to reduce every vertex’s degree from m − 1 = D + 1 to D − 1. In K_m \ E(C_m) choose a maximum matching M that leaves a prescribed vertex w unmatched (possible because m is odd). Adding M increases the degree of matched vertices by 1, yielding degree D for all matched vertices, while deg(w) = D − 1. The resulting simple, connected H has the required degree sequence. Using H in the sealed‑bubble lemma gives Theorem 14(ii) rigorously for odd D.

Two‑way infinite bridges: meagre and dense (Theorem 16, completed)
We now supply a complete proof that the set of graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge is meagre but dense in G_{•,D} for every D > 2, in both ≤ D and = D.

Definition. For k ∈ N, let P_k be the set of rooted graphs that have a 2‑way infinite bridge e with dist(ρ,e) ≤ k and both endpoints of e in B_k.

Claim 1: P_k is nowhere dense. Let G_•^{F} be any realized cylinder with radius r ≥ k. Consider the finite set E_k of edges of F with both endpoints in B_k. For e ∈ E_k, write F − e as A ∪ B. Call e critical if both A and B contain at least one boundary vertex v ∈ L_r(F) with deg_F(v) < D; otherwise e is safe.
- If e is safe, say A has no boundary vertex with residual capacity. In any completion of F to an infinite graph with the same r‑ball (hence no edges incident to A’s boundary vertices can be added inside B_r), the component corresponding to A remains finite. Therefore e cannot be a 2‑way infinite bridge in any such completion (even though it might be a 1‑way bridge).
- For the finitely many critical edges, choose a set S ⊆ L_r(F) that contains one residual boundary vertex from each side of each critical e. Outside B_r attach, for each v ∈ S, a new vertex x_v adjacent to v. Connect the x_v into a single simple cycle C that lies entirely outside B_r. Let H be this finite extension and set F′ = B_{r+2}(H). Then for every critical e = ab, there exists v_A ∈ S in A and v_B ∈ S in B and paths in F − e from a to v_A and from b to v_B. The external cycle provides a path from v_A to v_B outside B_r. Thus there is a cycle through e lying entirely in B_{r+2}(H), and e is not a bridge in any completion that preserves B_{r+2}. Therefore G_•^{F′} ⊆ G_•^{F} \ P_k. Nonemptiness: reserve at least one fresh boundary stub (possibly by adding an extra vertex y beyond C with degree < D) to permit infinite completions; in = D one later fills stubs outside B_{r+2} to ensure D‑regularity.
Hence P_k is nowhere dense.

Claim 2: ⋃_{k} P_k (the set of graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge) is meagre. Immediate by countable union of nowhere dense sets (Claim 1).

Claim 3: ⋃_{k} P_k is dense. Let G_•^{F} be any realized cylinder (radius r). There is some boundary vertex u with deg_F(u) < D in ≤ D; in = D, there exists at least one boundary stub across the entire boundary counting multiplicity of deficit to D. Build outside B_r two disjoint, infinite D‑bounded trees T_1 and T_2 (or D‑regular trees in the = D case once all local degrees are filled), and connect them by a single edge e far beyond radius r+1. Join u to T_1 by a long path (and optionally another boundary vertex to T_2 by a long path) so that B_r remains unchanged. Then e is a 2‑way infinite bridge in the resulting graph. Thus every cylinder intersects ⋃_{k} P_k, proving density.
Conclusion. The set of graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge is dense meagre.

Consequences for typicality by parity
Corollary (even D regular). In G_{•,=D} with even D, every bridge is 2‑way infinite (parity). Therefore the set “has a bridge” is meagre (by the meagreness of 2‑way bridges), and the complement “bridgeless” is comeagre (typical) in the standard local topology.

Scope and limits of Theorem 14(i)
- Odd D (≤ D and = D): The sealed‑bubble forcing provides, inside any cylinder, a subcylinder on which every graph has a bridge. Thus the set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense in these spaces. This part of Theorem 14 is recoverable with full rigor.
- Even D, = D: The same forcing cannot work (parity obstruction). Combined with the previous corollary, bridgeless is actually comeagre in this case, so the correct statement is the opposite of “nowhere dense.”
- Even D, ≤ D: The current proof sketch “attach a leaf” is invalid, and the sealed‑bubble method is blocked by the parity lemma if one tries to robustly forbid extra exits from the finite side. I see no alternative robust forcing in the local topology that would make “has a bridge” unavoidable in all completions. This casts serious doubt on Theorem 14(i) “for all D > 2” in the ≤ D setting when D is even. I recommend either restricting (i) to odd D or proving an impossibility claim: no r′‑ball can force a bridge in all completions when D is even (a plausible lemma: any would‑be bridge can be neutralized by adding an external bypass using residual capacity on the finite side). At minimum, mark even D in ≤ D as open pending a correct argument.

Theorem 15 (no cut vertex nowhere dense): status and fix
- For all D ≥ 2 (both ≤ D and = D), one can force a cut vertex robustly by taking two finite connected “blobs” whose vertices are saturated to degree D within the ball (in = D exact; in ≤ D at most D), identifying them at a single articulation vertex v (whose degree within the ball can be less than D), and ensuring all blob vertices other than v have no residual capacity within the ball. In any completion preserving the ball, no bypass edges between blobs can be added (blob vertices are saturated within the ball), hence v is a cut vertex in every completion. This supplies the missing details for Theorem 15.

Theorem 17 (edge‑chromatic number): current argument invalid
- The claim “removing an edge preserves χ′ = D + 1 by parity” is false in general (e.g., K_3). To prove “χ′ = D is nowhere dense,” one needs a finite class‑II forcer H_D (χ′(H_D) = D + 1) that remains a class‑II obstruction under supergraphs, plus an embedding lemma that respects degree budgets inside the cylinder. Candidates: for even D, overfull subgraphs (|E(H)| > ⌊D|V(H)|/2⌋) force class II; for odd D, odd‑order D‑regular graphs. The write‑up should either supply such a forcer and a rigorous local embedding argument (saturate H_D‑side within the ball) or mark this theorem as open.

Topology/metric sensitivity: what can and cannot change
- Typicality is a topological notion. Equivalent metrics yield identical typical sets. To transfer the sealed‑bubble forcing argument to alternative metrics/topologies, it suffices that the alternative topology τ contains all local cylinders as open sets (call such τ cylinder‑open). Then, given any τ‑open set U, choose a cylinder G_•^F ⊆ U, and refine to a subcylinder G_•^{F′} on which every graph has a bridge (odd D cases), proving that the bridgeless set is nowhere dense in τ as well.
- Even D, = D: bridgeless is comeagre already in the local topology, hence in any equivalent/cylinder‑open metric.
- Caution. Do not claim any monotonicity of meagreness/no‑where‑denseness under arbitrary refinements/coarsenings. For coarser topologies, τ′‑dense open sets need not be dense in τ; nowhere‑denseness also behaves non‑monotonically. Only explicit forcing inside open basic sets is safe.
- Nonlocal candidates. If one seeks a metric where bridgeless becomes typical in the odd‑D or ≤ D cases, the topology must not be cylinder‑open. E.g., topologies that can enforce “forbid attachments” at designated boundary vertices (your “tame” A(F,Π) with forbiddances) are strictly finer and might alter typicality, but require proofs of Polishness/Baire property. Before pursuing, formalize A(F,Π), verify separability/completeness/Baire, and then revisit bridge density.

Examples and sanity checks
- Pendant‑leaf counterexample. In ≤ D, attach a leaf at u inside the ball. In a completion, add two disjoint long paths from the leaf vertex to distant vertices and connect their endpoints via an edge beyond the ball; the original leaf‑edge lies on a cycle in this completion and is not a bridge. Thus “attach a leaf” is not a robust forcer.
- Explicit cubic bubble (D = 3). Using K_5, remove a 5‑cycle, add a matching leaving w unmatched to get degrees (3,3,3,3,2); then add the cut edge e = uw. Place this gadget outside the given ball as per the sealed‑bubble lemma to force a bridge in G_{•,=3}.

Actionable next steps
1) Amend Lemma 13: insert closure where needed, and add the clopen cylinder fact with a short proof.
2) Replace Theorem 14’s leaf argument with the sealed‑bubble forcing. State Theorem 14 precisely as: (a) in G_{•,=D} with odd D and in G_{•,≤D} with odd D, bridgeless is nowhere dense; (b) in G_{•,=D} with even D, bridgeless is comeagre; (c) in G_{•,≤D} with even D, the status is open (or supply a correct forcing, if any).
3) Insert the full proof that “2‑way infinite bridges” form a dense meagre set (Claims 1–3 above), and explicitly define “edge at distance ≤ k.”
4) Provide an explicit odd‑D bubble H (the K_{D+2} − C + M construction) with a short proof, and a D‑regular completion lemma to ensure nonemptiness of the refined cylinder.
5) Either supply a finite class‑II forcer and embedding lemma for Theorem 17 or mark it as an open problem.
6) State a topology invariance lemma for any cylinder‑open alternative metric: in such topologies, the odd‑D negative result for bridgeless typicality persists and the even‑D regular positive result persists.

Conclusion
- With the corrected sealed‑bubble forcing, bridgeless is nowhere dense in the odd‑D settings (≤ D and = D). The set of graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge is dense meagre for all D > 2, yielding that bridgeless is comeagre in = D with even D. The current claim that bridgeless is nowhere dense in ≤ D for all D > 2 is unsupported for even D; parity blocks any robust 1‑edge cut forcing, and a different valid argument is needed or the statement should be restricted. Theorem 17 requires a new proof or retraction. Finally, under any cylinder‑open alternative metric, these typicality conclusions remain unchanged; a change in typicality, if possible, must come from a genuinely nonlocal topology, whose Baire/Polish status and density properties remain to be established.
