  "summary_md": "This round replaces the invalid pendant\u2011leaf forcing with a robust sealed\u2011bubble construction: attach a finite D\u2011saturated block H to the core by a single edge e so that all vertices of H have no spare stubs; then e remains a bridge in every extension respecting the degree bound. Using this, we show that for any cylinder\u2011rich / strongly\u2011local topology (including the Benjamini\u2013Schramm metric and many natural local metrics) the set of bridgeless rooted graphs is nowhere dense in G_{\u2022,\u2264D} and in G_{\u2022,=D} for odd D\u22653. A parity obstruction shows the bubble method cannot produce a single\u2011edge cut when D is even; separately we prove that 2\u2011way infinite bridges are dense but meagre for D>2, so in the even D regular (=D) local space bridgeless graphs are comeagre. Nonlocal metrics can trivialize openness (e.g. add a global \u201chas a bridge\u201d bit); any genuine alternative must be shown metrizable/Baire and have different cylinder\u2011density behavior.
