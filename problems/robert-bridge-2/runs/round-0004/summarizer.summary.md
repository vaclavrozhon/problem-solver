This round replaces the invalid pendant‑leaf forcing with a robust sealed‑bubble construction: attach a finite D‑saturated block H to the core by a single edge e so that all vertices of H have no spare stubs; then e remains a bridge in every extension respecting the degree bound. Using this, we show that for any cylinder‑rich / strongly‑local topology (including the Benjamini–Schramm metric and many natural local metrics) the set of bridgeless rooted graphs is nowhere dense in G_{•,≤D} and in G_{•,=D} for odd D≥3. A parity obstruction shows the bubble method cannot produce a single‑edge cut when D is even; separately we prove that 2‑way infinite bridges are dense but meagre for D>2, so in the even D regular (=D) local space bridgeless graphs are comeagre. Nonlocal metrics can trivialize openness (e.g. add a global “has a bridge” bit); any genuine alternative must be shown metrizable/Baire and have different cylinder‑density behavior.
