Key points verified and corrections:
- Robust forcing: All pendant-leaf/path arguments are invalid; completions can add edges at the leaf and destroy bridgelessness. The correct scheme is a sealed finite bubble entirely within a bounded ball: saturate all bubble-side vertices to degree D within the ball (exactly D in the =D case), and allow exactly one attachment across the cut. For odd D this works cleanly and forces a bridge in every completion; your Erdős–Gallai construction for a finite bubble with degree sequence (D−1,D,…,D) is sound, and the D-regular completion by attaching (D−1)-ary trees is valid.
- Even D parity: For even D, any finite sealed side with all vertices degree D in the final graph must have an even edge boundary. Hence a single cross-edge cut is impossible. This blocks any sealed-bubble forcing of a 1-edge cut in ≤D when D is even. Prover 2’s “one spare stub” variant still yields |∂S|=1 in any connected completion (all bubble vertices become degree D after adding the unique cross-edge), contradicting parity; the resulting cylinder is empty. So that lemma is incorrect for even D.
- Two-way bridges: For each k, the property “has a 2‑way infinite bridge meeting B_k” is nowhere dense by cycle-shielding via a single external cycle threaded through finitely many boundary vertices with spare capacity. The union over k is meagre; the set is also dense. With the even‑regular parity lemma, bridgeless is comeagre for =D with even D under any strongly local metric.
- Metric class: Strongly local (cylinder‑dominating) metrics (weighted local, FO‑local) are Polish and preserve the forcing arguments; typicality conclusions match the local topology in the regimes covered above.

Next steps:
- Finalize the D‑regular completion lemma details (odd D) and include a short, general “finite regularization inside the ball” filler lemma.
- For ≤D, even D: either find a new forcing principle (unlikely) or prove an impossibility theorem for cylinder‑based forcing; do not assert nowhere‑denseness there without proof.
- Catalog strongly local metrics formally and close invariance claims for them. If pursuing nonlocal topologies to flip typicality, establish Baire/Polish status first, then revisit density of 1‑edge cuts.
