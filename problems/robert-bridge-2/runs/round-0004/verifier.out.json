  "feedback_md": "Key points verified and corrections:\n- Robust forcing: All pendant-leaf/path arguments are invalid; completions can add edges at the leaf and destroy bridgelessness. The correct scheme is a sealed finite bubble entirely within a bounded ball: saturate all bubble-side vertices to degree D within the ball (exactly D in the =D case), and allow exactly one attachment across the cut. For odd D this works cleanly and forces a bridge in every completion; your Erd\u0151s\u2013Gallai construction for a finite bubble with degree sequence (D\u22121,D,\u2026,D) is sound, and the D-regular completion by attaching (D\u22121)-ary trees is valid.\n- Even D parity: For even D, any finite sealed side with all vertices degree D in the final graph must have an even edge boundary. Hence a single cross-edge cut is impossible. This blocks any sealed-bubble forcing of a 1-edge cut in \u2264D when D is even. Prover 2\u2019s \u201cone spare stub\u201d variant still yields |\u2202S|=1 in any connected completion (all bubble vertices become degree D after adding the unique cross-edge), contradicting parity; the resulting cylinder is empty. So that lemma is incorrect for even D.\n- Two-way bridges: For each k, the property \u201chas a 2\u2011way infinite bridge meeting B_k\u201d is nowhere dense by cycle-shielding via a single external cycle threaded through finitely many boundary vertices with spare capacity. The union over k is meagre; the set is also dense. With the even\u2011regular parity lemma, bridgeless is comeagre for =D with even D under any strongly local metric.\n- Metric class: Strongly local (cylinder\u2011dominating) metrics (weighted local, FO\u2011local) are Polish and preserve the forcing arguments; typicality conclusions match the local topology in the regimes covered above.\n\nNext steps:\n- Finalize the D\u2011regular completion lemma details (odd D) and include a short, general \u201cfinite regularization inside the ball\u201d filler lemma.\n- For \u2264D, even D: either find a new forcing principle (unlikely) or prove an impossibility theorem for cylinder\u2011based forcing; do not assert nowhere\u2011denseness there without proof.\n- Catalog strongly local metrics formally and close invariance claims for them. If pursuing nonlocal topologies to flip typicality, establish Baire/Polish status first, then revisit density of 1\u2011edge cuts.\n",

    "content": "Consolidated status on bridges and metrics\n\n- Correct forcing principle: A pendant leaf does not force a bridge. Use a sealed finite bubble S entirely within a bounded ball: saturate every vertex of S to degree D within the ball (exactly D in =D), and attach S to the core by a single edge. For odd D this forces a bridge in every completion; Erd\u0151s\u2013Gallai supplies a finite bubble with degree sequence (D\u22121,D,\u2026,D), and infinite completions exist by attaching (D\u22121)-ary trees.\n- Even D obstruction: If D is even and every vertex in finite S has degree D in the final graph, then the cut size |\u2202S| must be even. Thus a single cross-edge cut cannot occur. Any \u2018one spare stub\u2019 variant that forces exactly one cross-edge yields an empty cylinder by parity; such constructions cannot witness nowhere\u2011denseness for even D in \u2264D.\n- Two\u2011way bridges: For D>2 and each k, refine any cylinder by attaching one new neighbor to finitely many boundary vertices with spare capacity and connecting those new neighbors in a single external cycle. Then every edge within distance \u2264k lies on a cycle; hence \u201c2\u2011way bridge at distance \u2264k\u201d is nowhere dense. The union over k is meagre, and the set is dense by adding a far\u2011away double ray with a single connector.\n- Metric class: Strongly local (cylinder\u2011dominating) metrics (e.g., weighted sums over r\u2011ball disagreements; FO\u2011local via Gaifman locality) are Polish and preserve the forcing arguments. In these, bridgeless is nowhere dense for odd D (\u2264D and =D), while for even D\u2011regular it is already comeagre.\n\nOpen: Settle bridgeless typicality in \u2264D for even D (likely requires a new idea or an impossibility theorem). Formalize the strongly\u2011local class and finalize the odd\u2011D regular completion details."
