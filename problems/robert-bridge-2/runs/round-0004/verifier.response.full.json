An edge from the S vertex to the outside would exceed its degree limit, which isn\u2019t allowed. So, the only possible cross-edge is from z, meaning there\u2019s exactly one cross-edge, which I\u2019m calling e. It seems that e serves as a cut-edge in the entire infinite graph.

Since e is the only cross-edge, if it's removed, there wouldn't be a path anymore. However, I noticed that F' is constructed to include S while leaving z at a degree of D-1. They've stated that in any completion of F', there must be at least one cross-edge \u03b4(S) for connectivity. But can the completion add edges inside F'? No, since the adjacency must match F' exactly within that radius. So, cross-edges must have one endpoint in S and the other outside the radius R.",

Now, concerning Lemma 1 of Prover 2, it seems valid for degrees \u2264D when D > 2.

Therefore, I have D|S| = 2|E(S)| + |\u2202S|, indicating that |\u2202S| must be even. If we added one cross-edge e, then |\u2202S| would equal 1, leading to a contradiction.

Without a cross-edge, z could be at D-1, which is allowed, but then S would be disconnected, so a cross-edge is necessary. Yet, the parity issue remains since with D even, all vertices in S would need to have degree D, creating contradictions. Two-way bridges are also discussed, but it\u2019s essential to manage degree budgets properly.

For odd D this works cleanly and forces a bridge in every completion; your Erd\u0151s\u2013Gallai construction for a finite bubble with degree sequence (D\u22121,D,\u2026,D) is sound, and the D-regular completion by attaching (D\u22121)-ary trees is valid.\\n- Even D parity: For even D, any finite sealed side with all vertices degree D in the final graph must have an even edge boundary.

Prover 2\u2019s \u201cone spare stub\u201d variant still yields |\u2202S|=1 in any connected completion (all bubble vertices become degree D after adding the unique cross-edge), contradicting parity; the resulting cylinder is empty.
