{"feedback_md":"Key points verified and corrections:\n- Robust forcing: All pendant-leaf/path arguments are invalid; completions can add edges at the leaf and destroy bridgelessness. The correct scheme is a sealed finite bubble entirely within a bounded ball: saturate all bubble-side vertices to degree D within the ball (exactly D in the =D case), and allow exactly one attachment across the cut. For odd D this works cleanly and forces a bridge in every completion; your Erdős–Gallai construction for a finite bubble with degree sequence (D−1,D,…,D) is sound, and the D-regular completion by attaching (D−1)-ary trees is valid.\n- Even D parity: For even D, any finite sealed side with all vertices degree D in the final graph must have an even edge boundary. Hence a single cross-edge cut is impossible. This blocks any sealed-bubble forcing of a 1-edge cut in ≤D when D is even. Prover 2’s “one spare stub” variant still yields |∂S|=1 in any connected completion (all bubble vertices become degree D after adding the unique cross-edge), contradicting parity; the resulting cylinder is empty.

Use a sealed finite bubble S entirely within a bounded ball: saturate every vertex of S to degree D within the ball (exactly D in =D), and attach S to the core by a single edge. For odd D this forces a bridge in every completion; Erdős–Gallai supplies a finite bubble with degree sequence (D−1,D,…,D), and infinite completions exist by attaching (D−1)-ary trees.\n- Even D obstruction: If D is even and every vertex in finite S has degree D in the final graph, then the cut size |∂S| must be even. Thus a single cross-edge cut cannot occur. Any ‘one spare stub’ variant that forces exactly one cross-edge yields an empty cylinder by parity; such constructions cannot witness nowhere‑denseness for even D in ≤D.\n- Two‑way bridges: For D>2 and each k, refine any cylinder by attaching one new neighbor to finitely many boundary vertices with spare capacity and connecting those new neighbors in a single external cycle. Then every edge within distance ≤k lies on a cycle; hence “2‑way bridge at distance ≤k” is nowhere dense. The union over k is meagre, and the set is dense by adding a far‑away double ray with a single connector.\n- Metric class: Strongly local (cylinder‑dominating) metrics (e.g., weighted sums over r‑ball disagreements; FO‑local via Gaifman locality) are Polish and preserve the forcing arguments. In these, bridgeless is nowhere dense for odd D (≤D and =D), while for even D‑regular it is already comeagre.\n\nOpen: Settle bridgeless typicality in ≤D for even D (likely requires a new idea or an impossibility theorem).
