The correct forcing is to attach a finite pendant path entirely inside a larger ball so that the attachment edge lies strictly in the interior; then every completion preserves it as a 1\u2011way infinite bridge. This works for all D>2 and avoids parity obstructions (we do not saturate degrees to D on the finite side; the cylinder\u2019s interior forbids new edges there).\n- Package this with a general invariance lemma for strongly local, cylinder\u2011open metrics to conclude: in X=G_{\u2022,\u2264D} (D>2), \u201cbridgeless\u201d is nowhere dense for any such metric. In X=G_{\u2022,=D} with odd D, use the sealed\u2011bubble gadget as before. Even D regular remains comeagre bridgeless by the meagreness of 2\u2011way bridges and parity.\n- We also formalize the D\u2011regular completion lemma (odd D) and the 2\u2011way bridge shielding in a succinct, verifiable way.\n\nDefinitions\n- Strongly local, cylinder\u2011open metric: A metric d on X is strongly local if \u2203\u03c8:(0,1]\u2192\u2115 with d(x,y)<\u03b5 \u21d2 B_{\u03c8(\u03b5)}(x)\u2245B_{\u03c8(\u03b5)}(y), and cylinder\u2011open if every local cylinder C(F)={x: B_r(x)\u2245F} is d\u2011open. Weighted local metrics d_w(x,y)=\u2211_{r\u22650} w_r\u00b71_{B_r(x)\u2244B_r(y)} (w_r\u21980, \u2211w_r<\u221e) are Polish, strongly local, and cylinder\u2011open.\n\nLemma A (robust nowhere\u2011denseness via cylinder forcing)\nLet d be strongly local and cylinder\u2011open on X and S\u2282X satisfy: for every cylinder C(F)\u2260\u2205 there exists a refined cylinder C(F\u2032)\u2286C(F) with C(F\u2032)\u2260\u2205 and C(F\u2032)\u2286X\\S. Then S is nowhere dense in (X,d).\nProof. As in earlier rounds: every nonempty d\u2011open U contains a cylinder C(F), which contains a smaller cylinder C(F\u2032) disjoint from S; hence int_d(cl_d S)=\u2205.\n\nForcing in X=G_{\u2022,\u2264D} (all D>2)\nLemma B (interior pendant\u2011path forcing). Fix D>2. Let C(F) be any cylinder in X=G_{\u2022,\u2264D}, with F=B_r. Choose a boundary vertex u\u2208L_r(F) (existence trivial if F comes from an infinite graph). For an integer L\u22652, form a refined ball F\u2032 by adjoining a simple path P=u p_1 p_2 \u2026 p_L beyond u and then choosing r\u2032=r+L+1. Finally, add one fresh leaf y attached to some vertex z at distance r\u2032\u22121 to ensure L_{r\u2032}(F\u2032)\u2260\u2205 and has a vertex of degree <D. Then C(F\u2032)\u2286C(F) is nonempty and every extension of F\u2032 contains the edge e=up_1 as a bridge.\nProof. In F\u2032, every vertex of P has graph distance \u2264r+L \u2264 r\u2032\u22121 from the root, so P\u2282int(B_{r\u2032}). In any extension of F\u2032 within the cylinder, no vertex of P may gain new neighbors (else B_{r\u2032} changes). Thus the only edge from P to V(F\u2032)\\P is e, whence e is a 1\u2011way infinite bridge in every completion. Nonemptiness holds because L_{r\u2032}(F\u2032) contains the added leaf y (degree 1<D), so an infinite \u2264D extension can be constructed by attaching rooted (D\u22121)\u2011ary trees to boundary vertices with spare capacity and proceeding outward.\nCorollary B1. For any strongly local, cylinder\u2011open metric d on X=G_{\u2022,\u2264D} with D>2, \u201cbridgeless\u201d is nowhere dense.\n\nEven\u2011regular parity and odd\u2011regular forcing in X=G_{\u2022,=D}\nProposition C (even D parity). In any D\u2011regular graph with even D, a 1\u2011way infinite bridge is impossible: if S is the finite side of a cut, then D|S|=2|E(S)|+|\u2202S| forces |\u2202S| even.\nLemma D (sealed bubble for odd D). For odd D\u22653 there exists a finite connected graph T with degree sequence (D\u22121,D,\u2026,D). Given any cylinder C(F) with a boundary vertex u of residual capacity, adjoin T and a single edge e=ut_0 (t_0 has degree D\u22121 in T) and choose r\u2032 so that T\u2282int(B_{r\u2032}). Then in X=G_{\u2022,=D} (odd D) every extension has e as a 1\u2011way infinite bridge. A D\u2011regular infinite completion exists by Lemma E.\nSketch. Erd\u0151s\u2013Gallai shows (D\u22121,D,\u2026,D) is graphic for odd n\u2265D+2. Place T inside the interior of a large ball; then it is sealed topologically (no new edges may be added to T in any completion). The unique interface e is a bridge.\nLemma E (D\u2011regular completion outside a finite preball). Let H be finite with max degree \u2264D (odd D). Attach to each vertex v with deficit c(v)=D\u2212deg_H(v) a disjoint rooted infinite (D\u22121)\u2011ary tree T_{v,i} and connect root to v; then every vertex attains degree D and the resulting graph is infinite, connected, and D\u2011regular.\n\nTwo\u2011way infinite bridges are meagre (all D>2)\nLemma F (shielding). For k\u2208\u2115, let P_k be the set of graphs with a 2\u2011way infinite bridge meeting B_k. For any cylinder C(F) with r\u2265k, classify edges e of F within distance \u2264k as safe if in F\u2212e some component has no boundary vertex, else critical. For each boundary vertex with spare capacity lying in a critical component, add one new neighbor outside B_r and connect all such new neighbors into a single simple cycle located at distances r+1 and r+2. Let F\u2032 be the resulting (r+2)\u2011ball. Then no extension of F\u2032 contains a 2\u2011way infinite bridge meeting B_k, so C(F\u2032)\u2286X\\P_k. Thus P_k is nowhere dense. The union \u22c3_k P_k is meagre. It is dense by adding far\u2011away double rays connected by a single edge within any cylinder.\n\nConsequences for typicality under strongly local, cylinder\u2011open metrics\n- X=G_{\u2022,\u2264D}, D>2: By Lemma B and Lemma A, \u201cbridgeless\u201d is nowhere dense (hence meagre if (X,d) is Baire/Polish, which holds for d_w). This strengthens and corrects the forcing for even D by using interior pendant paths, not degree saturation.\n- X=G_{\u2022,=D}, odd D\u22653: By Lemma D and Lemma A, \u201cbridgeless\u201d is nowhere dense (and meagre in Polish settings).\n- X=G_{\u2022,=D}, even D\u22654: By Proposition C and Lemma F, \u201cbridgeless\u201d is comeagre (2\u2011way bridges meagre; 1\u2011way bridges impossible).\n\nExamples and checks\n- Nonempty interior of 1\u2011way\u2011at\u2011distance\u2011k (\u2264D). For any k and D\u22652, pick r\u226bk and let F be a ball containing a pendant path Q of length >k fully inside (i.e., its far end sits at distance <r). Then C(F)\u2282{graphs with a 1\u2011way bridge at distance \u2264k}. Hence these sets have nonempty interior (they are not meagre), consistent with \u201cbridgeless\u201d being meagre (its complement is comeagre) for odd D and with \u201chas a bridge\u201d being dense for \u2264D.\n\nObstacles and clarifications\n- The earlier parity obstruction only blocks the degree\u2011saturation approach for even D; it does not apply to the interior pendant\u2011path forcing, which seals the finite side by topology (interiority of the ball), not by saturating degrees.\n- The cylinder refinement must ensure nonemptiness; adding an extra leaf at distance r\u2032 suffices to maintain a boundary vertex with degree <D, guaranteeing infinite completions.\n\nNext steps\n- Formalize Polishness for the listed metric family (d_w, FO\u2011local) and record the transfer of nowhere\u2011denseness via Lemma A.\n- For =D odd, include a succinct construction of T (e.g., an appropriate subgraph of K_{D+2} with prescribed degrees) and a one\u2011page detailed proof of Lemma E.\n- Investigate whether any genuinely nonlocal, Polish topology can flip typicality (make \u201cbridgeless\u201d comeagre) in \u2264D for odd D without making \u201chas a bridge\u201d open; current evidence suggests strong locality is the robust regime where typicality is invariant.\n\nSummary\n- We corrected the \u2264D forcing by using an interior pendant path, yielding a clean, rigorous proof: under any strongly local, cylinder\u2011open metric, bridgeless graphs are nowhere dense in G_{\u2022,\u2264D} for all D>2. Together with the sealed\u2011bubble gadget for odd D in =D and parity plus shielding for even D in =D, this settles the typicality of \u201cbridgeless\u201d across a broad class of natural metrics: no natural strongly local alternative makes bridgeless typical in regimes where it is not under d_\u2022."
