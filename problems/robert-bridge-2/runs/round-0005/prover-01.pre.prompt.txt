## Setting

- Fix an integer \(D \ge 2\).
- Let \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) be the space of **countably infinite, connected, rooted graphs** \((G,\rho)\).
- For \((G,\rho) \in \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) and \(r \in \mathbb{N}\), let \(B_r(G,\rho)\) denote the rooted (closed) ball of radius \(r\) about \(\rho\).
- Equip \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) with the **local (Benjamini–Schramm) metric** \(d_\bullet\) given by
  \[
  d_\bullet\big((G,\rho),(H,\sigma)\big)=2^{-R},
  \qquad
  R=\sup\{r\in\mathbb{N} : B_r(G,\rho)\cong B_r(H,\sigma)\}.
  \]
  (Equivalently, \(d_\bullet((G,\rho),(H,\sigma))<2^{-r}\) iff \(B_r(G,\rho)\cong B_r(H,\sigma)\).)
- Degree‑constrained subspaces:
  - \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\): all rooted graphs with \(\Delta(G)\le D\).
  - \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,= D}\): all rooted graphs with \(\Delta(G)= D\).
  We write \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for either of these when the distinction is unimportant.
- A subset \(S\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) is **nowhere dense** if the interior of \(\overline{S}\) is empty. A set is **meagre** (first category) if it is a countable union of nowhere dense sets; its complement is **comeagre**. A property is called **typical** if the corresponding set is comeagre.
- An edge \(e\) of an (unrooted) graph \(G\) is a **bridge** if \(G-e\) has more connected components than \(G\). A bridge is **2‑way infinite** if both components are infinite and **1‑way infinite** otherwise.

---
Prove or disprove:


## Conjecture — Metric sensitivity of typicality
There exists a **natural alternative metric** on the same underlying set \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for which the collection of **typical properties** differs from those under \(d_\bullet\). In particular, determine whether there is a reasonable metric in which **bridgeless graphs are typical**, or prove that no such metric can change their typicality.

# Research Notes



Working hypothesis: Robustness of bridge atypicality under tame topologies.

Definitions (to be formalized):
- A tame topology on X=G_{\bullet,D} has a countable base consisting of sets A(F,Π), where F is a rooted r-ball and Π is a finite boundary datum on a finite subset S of the boundary L_r(F). Π should specify: (i) residual degree budget at each v∈S (an integer in [0,D−deg_F(v)]), and (ii) finitely many local forbiddances of new adjacencies between specified boundary atoms; any completion must respect these.
- Basic cylinders C(F)=\{G: B_r(G)≅F\} are special cases A(F,∅). The topology is required to be generated by these A(F,Π), and the space should be Polish (hence Baire).

Goal: For all tame τ and for X=G_{\bullet,≤D} (D>2) and X=G_{\bullet,=D} with odd D, the bridgeless set is nowhere dense. For even D regular, bridgeless is already comeagre under d_• (1‑way bridges impossible; 2‑way bridges meagre), so no flip is needed.

Bridge‑forcing sketch (≤D):
- Given nonempty A(F,Π), extend F to a larger ball F′ by attaching a finite tree gadget T outside a buffered annulus so that exactly one edge e crosses from F‑side to T‑side, and saturate degrees of all vertices on both sides that could create additional outside connections. Ensure T is disjoint from S so Π is unaffected.
- In any completion respecting Π, degrees on the cut interface are saturated; hence no new outside edge can connect T to the rest, and e remains the unique cut‑edge, i.e., a bridge. Also leave ample unsaturated boundary elsewhere to admit infinite completions.

Odd D regular gadget: Replace the degree‑saturation by a D‑regular odd gadget ensuring a unique cut‑edge while keeping all degrees exactly D. To be written in full detail (parity bookkeeping, buffer, and compatibility with Π).

Planned verification checklists:
- Precisely define Π and show A(F,Π) form a base; prove nonemptiness criteria and that the space is Polish.
- Show common “finite‑coding” metrics (weighted sums of finitely many r‑ball tests) are tame.
- Write the bridge‑forcing lemma rigorously for ≤D and odd D regular.
- Explore whether logical/Stone topologies are tame; if not, test whether bridge‑forcing still yields nowhere denseness.


Agenda and corrections

- Robust bridge forcing: Attaching a leaf or a short pendant path does NOT force a bridge in all extensions, since extensions may add edges at the leaf. Correct forcing uses a finite D‑saturated bubble on one side: build a finite connected subgraph H whose vertices all have degree D (in \le D) or exactly D (in =D), except a designated vertex w with degree D−1 inside H; connect w to a boundary vertex u in the core by a single edge e=uw. Saturate all vertices of H (including w after adding e) to degree D within the prescribed ball, and do not add any other edges between H and the core. Then in every extension respecting the degree bound, no new edges can be added at H, so e remains the unique edge across the cut and is a bridge. The H side is finite; the other side can be extended to infinity via other boundary vertices.
- Cylinder‑rich topologies: We call a topology cylinder‑rich if for every open neighborhood U of x there exists r with the cylinder {y: B_r(y)≅B_r(x)} contained in U. This covers the local metric and many natural local metrics (weighted multi‑radius edit distances, etc.). In any cylinder‑rich topology, the above gadget yields a cylinder on which every graph has a bridge, so bridgeless sets are nowhere dense in G_{•,≤D} and in G_{•,=D} for odd D.
- Even D‑regular parity: In D‑regular graphs with even D, every bridge is 2‑way infinite; 1‑way infinite bridges are impossible by degree‑sum parity on a finite component.
- Nonlocal attempts: Adding a global boolean “has a bridge” coordinate makes that property open and cannot render “bridgeless” typical. An end‑sensitive topology may alter typicality but needs proof of metrizability/Baire property and density arguments to rule out 1‑edge cuts.

Open tasks
- Formalize the saturated‑bubble construction in regular (=D) odd case, including existence of infinite D‑regular extensions realizing the refined ball.
- Prove (or refute) that “has a 2‑way infinite bridge” is meagre in ≤D and =D; this would imply comeagre bridgeless for even D.
- Specify and study a natural nonlocal, Baire topology (e.g., end‑profile inverse limit) where bridgeless might be typical; verify all topological properties first.

Refinements and corrections to the topology and forcing scheme

- Cylinder‑open vs cylinder‑rich: For invariance of nowhere‑denseness across alternative metrics/topologies, we require that the new topology contains the local (Benjamini–Schramm) cylinders as open sets (call such topologies cylinder‑open). The weaker condition that each open set contains some local cylinder (cylinder‑rich) is insufficient to transfer category statements.

- Robust bridge forcing (final): Pendant leaves do not force bridges. Use a finite saturated bubble H attached by a single edge e to the core so that every vertex of H has degree D within the prescribed ball (and degree exactly D in the =D case). Then e remains a bridge in every completion. This works uniformly in ≤D and in =D for odd D; it is impossible for even D in the =D case due to parity (only 2‑way bridges can occur).

- 2‑way infinite bridges (D>2): For each k, the property “there is a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance ≤k” is nowhere dense. Construction: inside any cylinder, classify edges within distance ≤k as safe (one side has no boundary vertex with residual degree <D, hence cannot become infinite in any completion) or critical (both sides have a boundary vertex with residual degree). For critical edges, add one new neighbor to each such boundary vertex and link all these new neighbors into a single external cycle just outside the base radius; then each critical edge lies on a finite cycle entirely within a slightly larger ball. This yields meagreness of the union over k, and density follows by attaching two infinite branches connected by a single edge far outside.

- Even D‑regular: By parity, bridges are necessarily 2‑way infinite; with the meagreness above, bridgeless graphs are comeagre under the local topology.

Open items
- Provide a canonical odd‑regular finite bubble (e.g., a chain of K_{D+1}−e gadgets) and a clean extension existence lemma in =D.
- Catalog natural alternative metrics that are cylinder‑open (equivalent reweightings, FO‑local, decorated locals) and record invariance. Investigate genuinely nonlocal, Baire topologies if one seeks a change in typicality.

Two-way infinite bridges are dense meagre; bridgeless is comeagre for even D-regular

Setup: For D>2, fix k and let P_k be the set of rooted graphs that have a 2-way infinite bridge at distance ≤k. For any realized r-ball F with r≥k, construct an extension H by attaching, to each boundary vertex v with deg_F(v)<D, a new vertex x_v at distance r+1 and then connecting the x_v along a single cycle via additional new vertices outside B_r. Choose the construction so that at least one new vertex (on the outside cycle) still has residual degree to allow an infinite continuation; this ensures nonemptiness of the refined cylinder.

Key observations:
- If, in F−e, one side of an edge e at distance ≤k contains no boundary vertex with residual degree, then in any completion within the cylinder C(F) that side cannot become infinite, so e can never be a 2-way infinite bridge.
- Otherwise, pick boundary vertices v_A and v_B with residual degree on the two sides. In H there is a path from v_A to v_B outside B_r, so every such e lies on a cycle contained in B_{r+2}(H). Therefore, with F′=B_{r+2}(H), the cylinder C(F′) contains no graph from P_k.
Thus P_k is nowhere dense. Taking P=⋃_k P_k, we get that the set of graphs with a 2-way infinite bridge is meagre. The same construction shows P is dense by adding, in any cylinder, a far-away double ray connected by a single edge. For even D-regular graphs, any bridge is 2-way infinite; hence bridgeless is comeagre under the local topology.

Cylinder-rich (strongly local) topologies: A topology is cylinder‑rich if every open neighborhood around x contains a local cylinder C(B_r(x)). In any such topology, the sealed finite-component (“saturated bubble”) forcing shows bridgeless is nowhere dense in G_{•,≤D} and in G_{•,=D} for odd D. This covers many natural local metrics (weighted sums of r-ball disagreements, FO-local, edit-on-balls).

Consolidation: cylinder‑rich invariance and bridge forcing

- Cylinder‑rich topologies: We adopt the hypothesis that every open neighborhood around x contains some local cylinder C(B_r(x)). This includes the Benjamini–Schramm topology and many natural local metrics (weighted sums over r‑ball disagreements, FO‑local metrics). Under this hypothesis, any property whose complement can be forced by refining a cylinder is nowhere dense.

- Sealed‑bubble forcing (≤D, odd =D): Replace pendant leaves by a finite D‑saturated bubble H attached to the core by a single edge e. All vertices of H have total degree D inside the chosen ball (in =D, exactly D). No completion can add edges incident to H without changing the ball or violating degrees; hence e remains a bridge in every completion. For ≤D the existence of H with degree sequence (D,…,D,D−1) follows by Erdős–Gallai with n chosen so Dn is odd, plus Hakimi’s connectivity criterion; for odd D regular, an explicit gadget H arises from K_{D+2} minus a Hamiltonian cycle plus a maximum matching leaving one unmatched vertex.

- Two‑way bridges: For each k, classify edges at distance ≤k in a cylinder as safe (one side has no boundary vertex with residual capacity) or critical (both sides do). Only boundary vertices can connect to the outside while preserving the r‑ball, so safe edges cannot become 2‑way bridges. For critical edges, attach an external cycle through selected boundary vertices to place each such edge on a finite cycle within a slightly larger ball. Hence P_k is nowhere dense; ⋃_k P_k is meagre and dense.

- Even D regular: By parity, 1‑way bridges are impossible; combining with the meagreness of 2‑way bridges shows bridgeless is comeagre under the local topology (and any equivalent cylinder‑rich metric).

To‑dos: finalize the explicit existence proofs for H (≤D via EG+Hakimi; odd =D via K_{D+2} construction) and the D‑regular infinite completion lemma (2‑switch with edges outside H). Catalogue cylinder‑rich metrics and record Polish/Baire status.

Parity and forcing summary; metric class and current status

- Forcing bridges: Pendant leaves do not force a bridge. Use a sealed finite bubble S fully inside a ball: saturate all vertices of S to degree D within the ball and attach S to the core by a single edge e. Then in any completion respecting the ball, no new edges can be added at S, so e remains a bridge.
- Parity obstruction (even D): In any graph where every vertex of a finite set S has degree D (even), the cut size |∂S| must be even. Hence |∂S|=1 is impossible. Therefore the sealed‑bubble forcing cannot work for even D (including ≤D), explaining why leaf‑forcing fails.
- Odd D: The sealed‑bubble method works in both ≤D and =D. A finite connected simple graph with degree sequence (D,…,D,D−1) exists (EG), so joining its D−1 vertex by one edge to the core yields a bridge in all completions.
- 2‑way infinite bridges: For each k, shield every edge within distance ≤k by attaching a single new neighbor to each boundary vertex with residual capacity and connecting these new neighbors in one external cycle. Then those inner edges lie on cycles in any completion of the refined ball. Hence “2‑way infinite bridge at distance ≤k” is nowhere dense; the union over k is meagre. The set is also dense by adding a far‑away double ray with a single connector.
- Even D‑regular: Parity forbids 1‑way bridges; with the meagreness of 2‑way bridges, bridgeless is comeagre under the local topology.
- Metric class: Strongly local (cylinder‑dominating) metrics: small d‑balls sit inside some local cylinder. Weighted local and FO‑local metrics are of this type and Polish. In any such metric, the odd‑D sealed‑bubble forcing shows bridgeless is nowhere dense in ≤D (odd D) and =D (odd D).

Open items
- Provide a clean D‑regular completion lemma (odd D) to realize refined balls as infinite D‑regular graphs.
- Clarify the status of bridgeless nowhere denseness in ≤D for even D (likely impossible via cylinder‑based forcing due to parity). 
- Catalogue natural metrics in the strongly local class; for any nonlocal candidates, first prove Baire/Polish and then revisit forcing/density.

Status checkpoint

- Robust forcing: Pendant leaves do not force bridges. Use a sealed finite bubble S inside a fixed ball: every vertex in S attains degree D within the ball (exactly D in =D), and S connects to the core by a single edge e. Then e is a bridge in every completion preserving the ball. This works for odd D; for even D, parity implies |∂S| is even, so a 1‑edge cut cannot be sealed by degree saturation.
- Two‑way bridges: For each k, refine any cylinder by attaching one new neighbor to each boundary vertex with residual capacity and joining these new vertices by a single external cycle. Then every inner edge at distance ≤k lies on a finite cycle; hence “2‑way bridge within distance ≤k” is nowhere dense. The union over k is meagre and dense.
- Typicality summary: In =D with even D, bridgeless is comeagre (no 1‑way bridges; 2‑way bridges meagre). In odd D (≤D and =D), bridgeless is nowhere dense under any strongly local/cylinder‑open metric. The case ≤D with even D remains open with current methods.
- Metrics: Strongly local/cylinder‑open metrics (e.g., weighted local, FO‑local) are Polish and admit the forcing/refinement arguments above. Any change in typicality would require genuinely nonlocal topologies; Baire/metrizability must be established first.

To‑dos: finalize a clean D‑regular completion lemma; formalize the strongly local class and list examples; investigate impossibility of cylinder‑based forcing in ≤D for even D.

Consolidated status on bridges and metrics

- Correct forcing principle: A pendant leaf does not force a bridge. Use a sealed finite bubble S entirely within a bounded ball: saturate every vertex of S to degree D within the ball (exactly D in =D), and attach S to the core by a single edge. For odd D this forces a bridge in every completion; Erdős–Gallai supplies a finite bubble with degree sequence (D−1,D,…,D), and infinite completions exist by attaching (D−1)-ary trees.
- Even D obstruction: If D is even and every vertex in finite S has degree D in the final graph, then the cut size |∂S| must be even. Thus a single cross-edge cut cannot occur. Any ‘one spare stub’ variant that forces exactly one cross-edge yields an empty cylinder by parity; such constructions cannot witness nowhere‑denseness for even D in ≤D.
- Two‑way bridges: For D>2 and each k, refine any cylinder by attaching one new neighbor to finitely many boundary vertices with spare capacity and connecting those new neighbors in a single external cycle. Then every edge within distance ≤k lies on a cycle; hence “2‑way bridge at distance ≤k” is nowhere dense. The union over k is meagre, and the set is dense by adding a far‑away double ray with a single connector.
- Metric class: Strongly local (cylinder‑dominating) metrics (e.g., weighted sums over r‑ball disagreements; FO‑local via Gaifman locality) are Polish and preserve the forcing arguments. In these, bridgeless is nowhere dense for odd D (≤D and =D), while for even D‑regular it is already comeagre.

Open: Settle bridgeless typicality in ≤D for even D (likely requires a new idea or an impossibility theorem). Formalize the strongly‑local class and finalize the odd‑D regular completion details.

# Main Results




=== Round 1 Summary ===

Round summary (≤200 words): The round establishes a robust bridge‑forcing construction and uses it to show that under any cylinder‑rich topology (a class that includes the standard local metric d_• and many finite‑coding local metrics) the set of bridgeless rooted countable graphs is nowhere dense in G_{•,≤D} for all D≥2 and in G_{•,=D} for odd D≥3. The forcing uses a finite D‑saturated “bubble” H attached by a single edge e to a boundary vertex; H has no spare stubs, so e remains a bridge in every admissible extension. Even D‑regular graphs are exceptional because parity forbids 1‑way bridges, so the bubble trick cannot apply; the even‑D question reduces to whether graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge are meagre. Nonlocal/topologies that record global bridge data can change openness but require verification of metrizability/Baire properties. Remaining technical work: formalize the Π boundary datum/base and Polishness, complete the odd D regular gadget, and settle meagreness of 2‑way bridges.

=== Round 2 Summary ===

This round replaces the incorrect pendant‑leaf forcing by a robust “saturated bubble” construction: attach a finite connected subgraph H whose vertices are degree‑D (except one internal vertex of degree D−1) and join H to the core by a single edge e; after saturating degrees inside the ball e is forced to be a bridge in every admissible extension. Using this, we show that for any cylinder‑rich / cylinder‑open topology (which includes the standard local metric d_• and many natural local metrics) the set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense in G_{•,≤D} for all D≥2 and in G_{•,=D} for odd D≥3. By a parity lemma, even D‑regular graphs cannot have 1‑way bridges; we prove the set of graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge is dense but meagre for D>2, hence bridgeless is comeagre in the even D‑regular local space. Nonlocal metrics can change openness trivially, but any alternative must be shown metrizable/Baire and to have the required density properties. Citations: papers/paper1.txt; round research notes.


=== Round 3 Summary ===

Final round: replaced the invalid leaf‑forcing with a robust “sealed bubble” (finite D‑saturated block H attached by a single edge) that makes that edge a bridge in every completion. Using this, we proved that in any cylinder‑rich / strongly‑local topology (including the Benjamini–Schramm metric and many natural local metrics) the set of bridgeless rooted graphs is nowhere dense in G_{•,≤D} and in G_{•,=D} for odd D≥3. A parity obstruction shows the sealed‑bubble method cannot produce a single‑edge cut when D is even (all vertices in the finite side would have even degree), and we proved separately that 2‑way infinite bridges are dense but meagre for D>2; consequently, in the even D regular space (=D) bridgeless graphs are comeagre. Nonlocal metrics can trivially change openness (e.g. adding a global “has a bridge” bit) but any candidate must be shown metrizable/Baire and its density behavior checked. Citations: papers/paper1.txt; round research notes.


=== Round 4 Summary ===

This round replaces the invalid pendant‑leaf forcing with a robust sealed‑bubble construction: attach a finite D‑saturated block H to the core by a single edge e so that all vertices of H have no spare stubs; then e remains a bridge in every extension respecting the degree bound. Using this, we show that for any cylinder‑rich / strongly‑local topology (including the Benjamini–Schramm metric and many natural local metrics) the set of bridgeless rooted graphs is nowhere dense in G_{•,≤D} and in G_{•,=D} for odd D≥3. A parity obstruction shows the bubble method cannot produce a single‑edge cut when D is even; separately we prove that 2‑way infinite bridges are dense but meagre for D>2, so in the even D regular (=D) local space bridgeless graphs are comeagre. Nonlocal metrics can trivialize openness (e.g. add a global “has a bridge” bit); any genuine alternative must be shown metrizable/Baire and have different cylinder‑density behavior. Citations: papers/paper1.txt; round research notes.


=== Previous Round Feedback ===

Key points verified and corrections:
- Robust forcing: All pendant-leaf/path arguments are invalid; completions can add edges at the leaf and destroy bridgelessness. The correct scheme is a sealed finite bubble entirely within a bounded ball: saturate all bubble-side vertices to degree D within the ball (exactly D in the =D case), and allow exactly one attachment across the cut. For odd D this works cleanly and forces a bridge in every completion; your Erdős–Gallai construction for a finite bubble with degree sequence (D−1,D,…,D) is sound, and the D-regular completion by attaching (D−1)-ary trees is valid.
- Even D parity: For even D, any finite sealed side with all vertices degree D in the final graph must have an even edge boundary. Hence a single cross-edge cut is impossible. This blocks any sealed-bubble forcing of a 1-edge cut in ≤D when D is even. Prover 2’s “one spare stub” variant still yields |∂S|=1 in any connected completion (all bubble vertices become degree D after adding the unique cross-edge), contradicting parity; the resulting cylinder is empty. So that lemma is incorrect for even D.
- Two-way bridges: For each k, the property “has a 2‑way infinite bridge meeting B_k” is nowhere dense by cycle-shielding via a single external cycle threaded through finitely many boundary vertices with spare capacity. The union over k is meagre; the set is also dense. With the even‑regular parity lemma, bridgeless is comeagre for =D with even D under any strongly local metric.
- Metric class: Strongly local (cylinder‑dominating) metrics (weighted local, FO‑local) are Polish and preserve the forcing arguments; typicality conclusions match the local topology in the regimes covered above.

Next steps:
- Finalize the D‑regular completion lemma details (odd D) and include a short, general “finite regularization inside the ball” filler lemma.
- For ≤D, even D: either find a new forcing principle (unlikely) or prove an impossibility theorem for cylinder‑based forcing; do not assert nowhere‑denseness there without proof.
- Catalog strongly local metrics formally and close invariance claims for them. If pursuing nonlocal topologies to flip typicality, establish Baire/Polish status first, then revisit density of 1‑edge cuts.

### Typical properties of countable graphs: flows and bridges  
*(Extended abstract)*  

**Robert Šámal**\* · **Hadi Zamani**\*

#### Abstract
We have two aims. **First**, we study nowhere‑zero flows in countably infinite graphs, observing the different roles of two types of bridges. **Second**, we study how typical graphs with these types of bridges are. As there is no natural probability measure to use, we turn to an analytic approach: we study which sets are nowhere dense and which are meagre.

In finite graphs, bridges play a crucial role—it is easy to see that every flow assigns value \(0\) to every bridge. It is also known that graphs with a bridge are not typical: both dense random graphs and random regular graphs are bridgeless w.h.p. [3, 1]. We ask how this transfers to countable graphs. In Section 1 we explain differences between bridges and flows and, via compactness, we prove a version of Seymour’s 6‑flow theorem for countable graphs.

In Section 2 we explore nowhere‑dense and meagre sets. This is called for because the usual probabilistic models collapse: extending Erdős–Rényi to countably infinite graphs yields the Rado graph a.s., so we are effectively studying a single graph up to isomorphism. Attempting random regular graphs via the configuration model [1] would require a uniform distribution on perfect matchings of a countable set (e.g., neighbors of the first vertex), which does not exist. Consequently, we turn to Baire category: meagre/co‑meagre sets (also “first/second category”).

### 1. Nowhere‑zero flows for infinite graphs

**Definition 1 (weak flow).**  
Given an orientation \(D\) of a graph \(G\) and an abelian group \(A\), a **weak \(A\)‑flow** is a function \(\varphi:E(G)\to A\) such that **Kirchhoff’s law for each vertex cut** holds:
\[
\forall v\in V(G):\quad \sum_{e\in \delta^-(v)}\varphi(e)=\sum_{e\in \delta^+(v)}\varphi(e).
\]

**Definition 2 (strong flow).**  
Given \(D,G,A\) as above, a **strong \(A\)‑flow** is a function \(\varphi:E(G)\to A\) such that **Kirchhoff’s law for each cut** holds:
\[
\forall S\subseteq V(G):\quad \sum_{e\in \delta^+(S)}\varphi(e)=\sum_{e\in \delta^-(S)}\varphi(e).
\]

In either case, \(\varphi\) is a **nowhere‑zero** weak/strong \(A\)‑flow if \(\varphi^{-1}(0)=\varnothing\).

**Definition 3 (bridge).**  
An edge \(e\) of \(G\) is a **bridge** if deleting \(e\) increases the number of connected components. A bridge is **2‑way infinite** if both resulting components are infinite, and **1‑way infinite** otherwise.

Every strong flow is a weak flow. While the two notions are equivalent on finite graphs, they diverge on infinite graphs: e.g., on a two‑way infinite path, a nowhere‑zero weak \(A\)‑flow exists but a strong one does not. In [6] the authors construct a 3‑connected graph with two ends that admits a nowhere‑zero weak \(A\)‑flow but no nowhere‑zero strong \(A\)‑flow. Nearly all finite flow theorems extend to infinite **strong** \(A\)‑flows via topological compactness; here we use **logical** compactness to obtain:

**Theorem 4.**  
*A countably infinite, locally finite graph without a 1‑way infinite bridge has a nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow.*

### 2. Metric space of rooted connected graphs

Since no good probability measure exists for countable graphs, we study typicality via a metric topology and Baire category.

**Definition 5 (ε‑neighborhood).**  
For a metric space \((X,d)\) and \(x\in X\), the ε‑neighborhood is \(U_\varepsilon(x)=\{y\in X:\ d(x,y)<\varepsilon\}\). The closed neighborhood \(\overline{U}_\varepsilon(x)\) uses \(d(x,y)\le \varepsilon\).

**Definition 6 (open set).**  
A set \(U\subseteq X\) is open if \(\forall x\in U\ \exists \varepsilon>0:\ U_\varepsilon(x)\subseteq U\).

We now fix the graph space and metric.

**Definition 9 (space of rooted graphs).**  
Let \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) be the set of all connected rooted graphs (up to root‑preserving isomorphism). For \(D>2\), let \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) be those with all degrees \(\le D\), and \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) those with all degrees \(=D\).

**Definition 10 (r‑ball).**  
For \((G,v)\), the rooted r‑ball is
\[
B_r(G,v)=(\,G[\{y\in V(G): d(v,y)\le r\}],\,v\,).
\]

**Definition 11 (metric \(d_\bullet\)).**  
For \((G_1,v_1),(G_2,v_2)\in\mathbf{G}_\bullet\),
\[
d_\bullet\big((G_1,v_1),(G_2,v_2)\big)=\inf\{2^{-r} : B_r(G_1,v_1)\cong B_r(G_2,v_2)\}.
\]
This is a metric [5].

**Definition 12 (extensions of an r‑ball).**  
For an r‑ball \(F=B_r(G,v)\), define
\[
\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F=\{(G',v')\in \mathbf{G}_\bullet : B_r(G',v')\cong F\}.
\]

**Lemma 13 (basic facts in \((\mathbf{G}_\bullet,d_\bullet)\)).**  
- For each \((G,x)\), \(r\in\mathbb{N}\), and \(0<\varepsilon<1\):
  \[
  U_{2^{-r}+\varepsilon}((G,x))=U_{2^{-r}}((G,x))=\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{B_r(G,x)}.
  \]
- \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F\) is nonempty if \(F\) is an r‑ball in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) that contains a vertex of degree \< \(D\) at distance \(r\) from the root.
- A subset \(S\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) is nowhere dense iff
  \(\forall\) r‑balls \(F\ \exists\) r′‑ball \(F'\) with \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F'}\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F}\setminus S\).
- For all \(D>2\), \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) is not meagre.

### Main results on typical properties

**Theorem 14.**  
*The set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense (i) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) for all \(D>2\); and (ii) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) for all odd \(D>2\).*  
In D‑regular graphs with even \(D\), 1‑way infinite bridges cannot exist; instead we obtain:

**Theorem 15.**  
*The set of graphs without a cut vertex is nowhere dense in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

**Theorem 16.**  
*The set of graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge is meagre (but not nowhere dense) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

We also considered other (a)typical properties:

**Theorem 17.**  
*The set of graphs with edge‑chromatic number \(D\) is nowhere dense in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

### 3. Proof sketches

**Proof of Theorem 4 (sketch).**  
Let the vertices of \(G\) be \(v_1,v_2,\ldots\) and orient each edge \(\{v_i,v_j\}\) from the smaller to the larger index. For each radius \(r\), augment the r‑ball \(B_r(G,v_1)\) to a finite multigraph \(G_r\) by adding a sink vertex \(v_\infty\) and connecting boundary edges to \(v_\infty\). Introduce Boolean variables \(F_{e,1},\dots,F_{e,6}\) encoding which of six nonzero values an edge \(e\) receives, enforce exclusivity \(\bigvee_i F_{e,i}\) and \(\bigwedge_{j\ne i}\neg F_{e,j}\), and write linear parity constraints at each vertex (Kirchhoff’s law). Let \(F_{G_r}\) be the conjunction over vertices of \(G_r\); then every finite subset of the constraint family \(\{F_{G_r}\}_r\cup\{F_{e,i}\}_e\) is satisfiable (by [7]), hence by compactness [4] the whole set is satisfiable, yielding a nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow on \(G\).

**Proof idea for Theorem 14.**  
Given an r‑ball \(F\), construct an r′‑ball \(F'\) such that every extension of \(F'\) contains a bridge. For \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\), attach a leaf to a boundary vertex of degree \<\(D\). For \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) handle regularity via parity gadgets: define \(S(F)=\sum_{v\in L_r}(D-\deg v)\) where \(L_r\) is the boundary; use \(K_{D+1}-e\) gadgets and tree‑like expansions to force parity \(S(F)=1\), then attach a new vertex to create a bridge. Hence the bridgeless set is nowhere dense.

**Proof idea for Theorem 15.**  
In even \(D\)‑regular graphs, use gadgets to force a cut vertex; in odd \(D\) or degree‑bounded spaces, this also follows from the previous construction.

**Proof idea for Theorem 16.**  
Being “there is a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance \(k\)” is nowhere dense; take a union over \(k\in\mathbb{N}\) to get a meagre (but not nowhere‑dense) set.

**Proof idea for Theorem 17.**  
For each \(D\), there exist \(D\)‑regular graphs with \(\chi'(G)=D+1\) (even \(D\): complete graphs or any odd‑order \(D\)‑regular graph; odd \(D\): by Tutte’s theorem). Removing an edge preserves \(\chi'=D+1\) by parity. Embed parity gadgets within r‑balls so that every extension has edge‑chromatic number \(D+1\), hence the set is nowhere dense.

### 4. Future work (the conjectures)

**Question 18.** *Is the fact that a property is nowhere dense or meagre independent of the root?*  
A change of root gives one type of change of metric; however, many metrics on the space of countable graphs are possible.

**Question 19.** *Is there another metric on \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) where typical properties are different?*  
For instance, is there a metric in which **bridgeless graphs are typical**?

We also aim to investigate additional (a)typical properties in the spirit of Theorem 17.
