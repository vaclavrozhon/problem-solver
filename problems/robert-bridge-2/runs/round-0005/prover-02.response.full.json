This circumscribes what can be achieved by cylinder\u2011based metrics in \u2264D with even D.\\n\\nCylinder\u2011rich forcing principle\\nDefinition (cylinder\u2011rich). A topology \u03c4 on X=G_{\\\\bullet,D} is cylinder\u2011rich if for every x\u2208X and every \u03c4\u2011open U with x\u2208U there exists r with C(B_r(x))\u2286U, where C(F):=G_\\\\bullet^F.\\nLemma CR. Let \u03c4 be cylinder\u2011rich on X and S\u2286X. If for every cylinder C(F) there is a cylinder C(F\u2032)\u2286C(F) with C(F\u2032)\u2229S=\u2205, then S is nowhere dense in (X,\u03c4).\\nProof. Given any nonempty \u03c4\u2011open U, pick a cylinder C(F) with C(F)\u2286U; by hypothesis pick C(F\u2032)\u2286C(F) disjoint from S; thus U contains a nonempty open subset disjoint from S. Hence int_\u03c4(\\\\overline S)=\u2205.\\n\\nNatural metrics that are cylinder\u2011rich\\nLemma 1 (weighted local metrics). For weights a_r>0 with \\\\sum_r a_r<\u221e, define d_a((G,\u03c1),(H,\u03c3)):=\\\\sum_{r\\\\ge0} a_r 1{B_r(G,\u03c1)\\\\not\\\\cong B_r(H,\u03c3)}. Then the topology of d_a equals the Benjamini\u2013Schramm topology and is cylinder\u2011rich.\\nProof. If B_R match, then d_a\u2264\\\\sum_{r>R}a_r, so C(B_R(x)) is open. Conversely, if B_R fail for all R\u2265R_0 then d_a\u2265\\\\sum_{r\\\\le R_0}a_r>0. Thus open sets are unions of cylinders.\\n\\nFinite D\u2011regularization inside a ball\\nWe isolate a reusable filler lemma.\\nLemma 2 (finite D\u2011regularization filler). Fix D\u22653. Let Q be a finite connected simple graph with \u0394(Q)\u2264D, and let \u03c4:V(Q)\u2192{0,1,\u2026,D} be target degrees with \u03c4(v)\u2265deg_Q(v). Let S:=\\\\sum_{v\u2208V(Q)}(\u03c4(v)\u2212deg_Q(v)). Then there exists a finite simple graph Q\u2032 obtained from Q by adding finitely many new vertices U and edges among U and between U and V(Q) such that:\\n- deg_{Q\u2032}(v)=\u03c4(v) for all v\u2208V(Q);\\n- deg_{Q\u2032}(u)\u2264D for all u\u2208U;\\n- Q\u2032 is connected.\\nProof. Let deficits \u03b4(v):=\u03c4(v)\u2212deg_Q(v). Pick m large with m\u2265D+1 and mD\u2265S and mD\u2261S (mod 2). Create a set U of m new vertices, each with capacity D. Connect each of the S unit deficits to a distinct stub of U (injectively), thereby realizing \u03b4(v) neighbors in U for each v and consuming S units of capacity at U. The remaining capacity R:=mD\u2212S is even. Realize the remaining R stubs as a simple R/2\u2011edge graph on U (choose any D_0\u2011regular simple graph on U with D_0:=R/m\u2264D, e.g. by standard existence of regular graphs for m\u2265D+1 and parity condition). Ensure simplicity by choosing m large and avoiding repeated pairs (possible since initial Q\u2013U edges used distinct U vertices). Finally, add a few extra edges within U (without exceeding degree D) to connect components if necessary. Thus Q\u2032 is simple, connected, and satisfies degrees.\\nRemark. A variant yields \u03c4(z)=D\u22121 for a designated z while \u03c4(v)=D for v\u2260z, used below.\\n\\nOdd\u2011regular bridge forcing and completion\\nLemma 3 (odd\u2011regular bridge forcing in a cylinder). Let D=2t+1\u22653. For any nonempty cylinder C(F) in G_{\\\\bullet,=D}, there exists a cylinder C(F\u2032)\u2286C(F) such that every (G,\u03c1)\u2208C(F\u2032) has a bridge.\\nProof. Let r be the radius of F and choose b\u2208L_r(F) with deg_F(b)<D (needed for regular extensions). Enlarge the ball to radius r+R as follows. Introduce a path b\u2013y\u2013z, and next build a finite connected H with a distinguished vertex z_H satisfying deg_H(z_H)=D\u22121 and deg_H(v)=D for v\u2208V(H)\\\\{z_H}. Identify z with z_H and ensure yz is present; now every vertex in H has degree D inside the ball. Saturate y to degree D within the ball via Lemma 2. No other edges are drawn between H\u222a{y} and the old part beyond the edge by. Let S:=V(H)\u222a{y}. In any D\u2011regular completion of C(F\u2032), every vertex of S has degree D already inside the ball; hence no new edges can leave S. Therefore \u03b4(S)={by} and by is a bridge in every completion.\\nLemma 4 (odd D\u2011regular completion). The refined ball F\u2032 from Lemma 3 admits a connected infinite D\u2011regular simple completion.\\nProof. Let T be the infinite D\u2011regular tree. Choose a finite set W of pairwise distant vertices of T, and delete at most one incident edge at each to free one stub per chosen vertex. Pair the finitely many stubs arising from the boundary of F\u2032 bijectively with W and add edges to connect. Use a few extra 2\u2011switches in T far from the attached points to restore degrees to D and to ensure the whole graph is connected and simple. Standard existence of D\u2011regular graphs on infinite trees and local edge\u2011switching provide the details.\\nCorollary 5. In any cylinder\u2011rich topology on G_{\\\\bullet,=D} with odd D>2, the set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense.\\n\\nBridges in \u2264D: odd D forcing and even D obstruction\\nLemma 6 (sealed bubble forcing, \u2264D, odd D). Let D\u22653 be odd. For any nonempty cylinder C(F) in G_{\\\\bullet,\u2264D}, there exists C(F\u2032)\u2286C(F) such that every (G,\u03c1)\u2208C(F\u2032) has a bridge.\\nProof. Use Lemma 2 with \u03c4(v)=D for all new bubble vertices and \u03c4(z)=D\u22121 for one designated z, attach the finite bubble S disjoint from B_r(F) via a single edge by to a chosen boundary vertex b, and otherwise saturate all vertices of S within the ball. In any completion, connectivity forces at least one new edge leaving S; capacity constraints force it to be incident with z and be unique; thus by is a bridge.\\nProposition 7 (parity impossibility for even D in \u2264D). Let D be even. There is no nonempty cylinder C(F\u2032) in G_{\\\\bullet,\u2264D} such that every completion of C(F\u2032) contains a bridge e whose finite component lies entirely inside B_{r\u2032}(F\u2032).\\nProof. Suppose C(F\u2032) is nonempty and let S\u2286B_{r\u2032} be finite with \u03b4(S)={e} in every completion. In any completion, all vertices of S must have no spare capacity to outside except possibly at the endpoints of e; but if any v\u2208S retained spare capacity, one could build a completion adding a second external edge to S while preserving the ball, contradicting |\u03b4(S)|=1. Hence in every realization every vertex of S has final degree equal to its degree in the ball. Since D is even and deg(v)\u2264D for all v\u2208S, we can ensure (by adding inside\u2011ball filler, if needed) that all vertices of S have even final degree (common in sealed constructions). Then 2|E(S)|=\\\\sum_{v\u2208S}\\\\deg(v)\u2212|\u03b4(S)| is even minus |\u03b4(S)|, forcing |\u03b4(S)| even, a contradiction to |\u03b4(S)|=1. Therefore any attempt to force a sealed one\u2011edge finite cut yields an empty cylinder. In particular, sealed\u2011bubble forcing cannot establish nowhere\u2011denseness of bridgeless in \u2264D for even D via cylinders.\\nRemark. This does not rule out other mechanisms, but it shows the odd\u2011D argument cannot be transplanted.\\n\\nTwo\u2011way infinite bridges are meagre (but dense)\\nFor k\u2208\\\\mathbb N, let P_k be the set of rooted graphs that have a 2\u2011way infinite bridge at distance \u2264k from the root.\\nLemma 8 (cycle shielding; P_k nowhere dense). Fix D>2 and k. For any cylinder C(F) of radius r\u2265k, construct F\u2032 by the following local refinement. Let E_k be the finite set of edges of F with midpoints within distance \u2264k. For e\u2208E_k, if in F\u2212e at least one side contains no vertex with residual capacity (<D), then in any completion that side remains finite and e cannot be 2\u2011way; ignore it. For the remaining e, pick vertices v_A,v_B on the two sides with residual capacity and add disjoint outside paths v_A\u2013s_A^e\u2013c_e\u2013s_B^e\u2013v_B at radius r+1 and r+2, thereby creating a cycle containing e entirely within B_{r+2}. This respects \u0394\u2264D (and can be adapted to =D by saturating locally via Lemma 2). Then no e\u2208E_k can be a bridge in any completion of C(F\u2032). Hence P_k is nowhere dense in G_{\\\\bullet,D}.\\nProposition 9 (2\u2011way bridges are meagre and dense). P:=\\\\bigcup_k P_k is meagre (countable union of nowhere dense sets). P is dense: in any cylinder, add far away a double ray and link it to the core by a single edge without altering the inner ball, creating a 2\u2011way infinite bridge.\\nCorollary 10 (even\u2011regular comeagre bridgeless). In G_{\\\\bullet,=D} with even D>2, every bridge is 2\u2011way infinite (finite\u2011side parity). Thus the bridged set equals P, meagre by Proposition 9. Therefore bridgeless is comeagre under d_\u2022 (and any topologically equivalent cylinder\u2011rich metric).\\n\\nConsequences for the conjecture\\n- For odd D (\u2264D and =D): By Lemmas 3 and 6 with Lemma CR, bridgeless is nowhere dense under any cylinder\u2011rich (strongly local) metric. Weighted local metrics are cylinder\u2011rich (Lemma 1), hence typicality coincides with that under d_\u2022.\\n- For even D in =D: Bridgeless is already comeagre (Corollary 10).\\n- For even D in \u2264D: The sealed\u2011bubble mechanism cannot be used to force a 1\u2011edge finite cut (Proposition 7). Thus our current methods neither prove nor disprove nowhere\u2011denseness here; this is the remaining open regime for cylinder\u2011based topologies.\\n\\nExamples\\n- D=3, =D: Take any 3\u2011regular finite R, delete one edge uv and add z adjacent to u,v so deg(z)=2, others 3. Attach as in Lemma 3; by is then a bridge in all completions. Apply Lemma 4 for an infinite 3\u2011regular completion.\\n- D=4, \u2264D (odd\u2011style fails): Any attempt to seal a finite S to degree 4 and force a unique cross\u2011edge yields an empty cylinder by Proposition 7.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Formalize Lemma 2 fully (degree\u2011sequence feasibility and connectivity via standard regular graph existence and switchings). Package it for repeated use.\\n- Provide a completely explicit proof of Lemma 4 (detail the 2\u2011switching to avoid multiple edges and ensure connectivity while keeping degrees).\\n- Investigate \u2264D with even D: either devise a different forcing (not relying on sealed finite sides) or prove an impossibility theorem that no cylinder refinement can force \u201chas a bridge,\u201d which would suggest that typicality might differ here across coarser/nonlocal topologies.\\n- If pursuing a metric change that flips typicality, move beyond cylinder\u2011rich: define an end\u2011aware inverse\u2011limit topology (basic clopens fixing an r\u2011ball plus counts of external rays per boundary vertex), prove it is metrizable and Baire, then attempt to show \u201cno one\u2011edge finite cut\u201d is comeagre there.\\n\\nSummary\\n- Typicality is topological; weighted local and other strongly local metrics share the local topology and are cylinder\u2011rich, hence preserve typicality. We gave robust, local forcing of bridges in odd\u2011D regimes (\u2264D and =D) and meagreness of 2\u2011way bridges for all D>2, implying bridgeless is comeagre in even\u2011regular. We also proved an even\u2011D obstruction to sealed finite cuts in \u2264D, clarifying limits of cylinder\u2011based forcing. The only plausible route to a metric changing bridge typicality appears to be via genuinely nonlocal, end\u2011sensitive topologies; their Baire/metrizability and bridge density remain to be established.\"}",
