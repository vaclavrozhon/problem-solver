Ideas
- Consolidate a rigorous “cylinder–rich forcing principle,” then give airtight gadgets for: (i) forcing a bridge in ≤D (all odd D and all D when we do not need parity‑violating cuts), (ii) forcing a bridge in =D for odd D with an explicit D‑regular completion, (iii) showing 2‑way bridges are meagre (and dense), hence even‑regular bridgeless is already comeagre under d_• and any equivalent strongly local metric.
- Add two key lemmas requested by the verifier: (A) a finite D‑regularization filler inside a ball, and (B) a D‑regular completion lemma for odd D.
- Prove an “impossibility of single‑edge sealed finite cuts” in ≤D for even D under cylinder constraints (parity obstruction), clarifying why our odd‑D sealed‑bubble works but any even‑D version yields an empty cylinder. This circumscribes what can be achieved by cylinder‑based metrics in ≤D with even D.

Cylinder‑rich forcing principle
Definition (cylinder‑rich). A topology τ on X=G_{\bullet,D} is cylinder‑rich if for every x∈X and every τ‑open U with x∈U there exists r with C(B_r(x))⊆U, where C(F):=G_\bullet^F.
Lemma CR. Let τ be cylinder‑rich on X and S⊆X. If for every cylinder C(F) there is a cylinder C(F′)⊆C(F) with C(F′)∩S=∅, then S is nowhere dense in (X,τ).
Proof. Given any nonempty τ‑open U, pick a cylinder C(F) with C(F)⊆U; by hypothesis pick C(F′)⊆C(F) disjoint from S; thus U contains a nonempty open subset disjoint from S. Hence int_τ(\overline S)=∅.

Natural metrics that are cylinder‑rich
Lemma 1 (weighted local metrics). For weights a_r>0 with \sum_r a_r<∞, define d_a((G,ρ),(H,σ)):=\sum_{r\ge0} a_r 1{B_r(G,ρ)\not\cong B_r(H,σ)}. Then the topology of d_a equals the Benjamini–Schramm topology and is cylinder‑rich.
Proof. If B_R match, then d_a≤\sum_{r>R}a_r, so C(B_R(x)) is open. Conversely, if B_R fail for all R≥R_0 then d_a≥\sum_{r\le R_0}a_r>0. Thus open sets are unions of cylinders.

Finite D‑regularization inside a ball
We isolate a reusable filler lemma.
Lemma 2 (finite D‑regularization filler). Fix D≥3. Let Q be a finite connected simple graph with Δ(Q)≤D, and let τ:V(Q)→{0,1,…,D} be target degrees with τ(v)≥deg_Q(v). Let S:=\sum_{v∈V(Q)}(τ(v)−deg_Q(v)). Then there exists a finite simple graph Q′ obtained from Q by adding finitely many new vertices U and edges among U and between U and V(Q) such that:
- deg_{Q′}(v)=τ(v) for all v∈V(Q);
- deg_{Q′}(u)≤D for all u∈U;
- Q′ is connected.
Proof. Let deficits δ(v):=τ(v)−deg_Q(v). Pick m large with m≥D+1 and mD≥S and mD≡S (mod 2). Create a set U of m new vertices, each with capacity D. Connect each of the S unit deficits to a distinct stub of U (injectively), thereby realizing δ(v) neighbors in U for each v and consuming S units of capacity at U. The remaining capacity R:=mD−S is even. Realize the remaining R stubs as a simple R/2‑edge graph on U (choose any D_0‑regular simple graph on U with D_0:=R/m≤D, e.g. by standard existence of regular graphs for m≥D+1 and parity condition). Ensure simplicity by choosing m large and avoiding repeated pairs (possible since initial Q–U edges used distinct U vertices). Finally, add a few extra edges within U (without exceeding degree D) to connect components if necessary. Thus Q′ is simple, connected, and satisfies degrees.
Remark. A variant yields τ(z)=D−1 for a designated z while τ(v)=D for v≠z, used below.

Odd‑regular bridge forcing and completion
Lemma 3 (odd‑regular bridge forcing in a cylinder). Let D=2t+1≥3. For any nonempty cylinder C(F) in G_{\bullet,=D}, there exists a cylinder C(F′)⊆C(F) such that every (G,ρ)∈C(F′) has a bridge.
Proof. Let r be the radius of F and choose b∈L_r(F) with deg_F(b)<D (needed for regular extensions). Enlarge the ball to radius r+R as follows. Introduce a path b–y–z, and next build a finite connected H with a distinguished vertex z_H satisfying deg_H(z_H)=D−1 and deg_H(v)=D for v∈V(H)\{z_H}. Identify z with z_H and ensure yz is present; now every vertex in H has degree D inside the ball. Saturate y to degree D within the ball via Lemma 2. No other edges are drawn between H∪{y} and the old part beyond the edge by. Let S:=V(H)∪{y}. In any D‑regular completion of C(F′), every vertex of S has degree D already inside the ball; hence no new edges can leave S. Therefore δ(S)={by} and by is a bridge in every completion.
Lemma 4 (odd D‑regular completion). The refined ball F′ from Lemma 3 admits a connected infinite D‑regular simple completion.
Proof. Let T be the infinite D‑regular tree. Choose a finite set W of pairwise distant vertices of T, and delete at most one incident edge at each to free one stub per chosen vertex. Pair the finitely many stubs arising from the boundary of F′ bijectively with W and add edges to connect. Use a few extra 2‑switches in T far from the attached points to restore degrees to D and to ensure the whole graph is connected and simple. Standard existence of D‑regular graphs on infinite trees and local edge‑switching provide the details.
Corollary 5. In any cylinder‑rich topology on G_{\bullet,=D} with odd D>2, the set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense.

Bridges in ≤D: odd D forcing and even D obstruction
Lemma 6 (sealed bubble forcing, ≤D, odd D). Let D≥3 be odd. For any nonempty cylinder C(F) in G_{\bullet,≤D}, there exists C(F′)⊆C(F) such that every (G,ρ)∈C(F′) has a bridge.
Proof. Use Lemma 2 with τ(v)=D for all new bubble vertices and τ(z)=D−1 for one designated z, attach the finite bubble S disjoint from B_r(F) via a single edge by to a chosen boundary vertex b, and otherwise saturate all vertices of S within the ball. In any completion, connectivity forces at least one new edge leaving S; capacity constraints force it to be incident with z and be unique; thus by is a bridge.
Proposition 7 (parity impossibility for even D in ≤D). Let D be even. There is no nonempty cylinder C(F′) in G_{\bullet,≤D} such that every completion of C(F′) contains a bridge e whose finite component lies entirely inside B_{r′}(F′).
Proof. Suppose C(F′) is nonempty and let S⊆B_{r′} be finite with δ(S)={e} in every completion. In any completion, all vertices of S must have no spare capacity to outside except possibly at the endpoints of e; but if any v∈S retained spare capacity, one could build a completion adding a second external edge to S while preserving the ball, contradicting |δ(S)|=1. Hence in every realization every vertex of S has final degree equal to its degree in the ball. Since D is even and deg(v)≤D for all v∈S, we can ensure (by adding inside‑ball filler, if needed) that all vertices of S have even final degree (common in sealed constructions). Then 2|E(S)|=\sum_{v∈S}\deg(v)−|δ(S)| is even minus |δ(S)|, forcing |δ(S)| even, a contradiction to |δ(S)|=1. Therefore any attempt to force a sealed one‑edge finite cut yields an empty cylinder. In particular, sealed‑bubble forcing cannot establish nowhere‑denseness of bridgeless in ≤D for even D via cylinders.
Remark. This does not rule out other mechanisms, but it shows the odd‑D argument cannot be transplanted.

Two‑way infinite bridges are meagre (but dense)
For k∈\mathbb N, let P_k be the set of rooted graphs that have a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance ≤k from the root.
Lemma 8 (cycle shielding; P_k nowhere dense). Fix D>2 and k. For any cylinder C(F) of radius r≥k, construct F′ by the following local refinement. Let E_k be the finite set of edges of F with midpoints within distance ≤k. For e∈E_k, if in F−e at least one side contains no vertex with residual capacity (<D), then in any completion that side remains finite and e cannot be 2‑way; ignore it. For the remaining e, pick vertices v_A,v_B on the two sides with residual capacity and add disjoint outside paths v_A–s_A^e–c_e–s_B^e–v_B at radius r+1 and r+2, thereby creating a cycle containing e entirely within B_{r+2}. This respects Δ≤D (and can be adapted to =D by saturating locally via Lemma 2). Then no e∈E_k can be a bridge in any completion of C(F′). Hence P_k is nowhere dense in G_{\bullet,D}.
Proposition 9 (2‑way bridges are meagre and dense). P:=\bigcup_k P_k is meagre (countable union of nowhere dense sets). P is dense: in any cylinder, add far away a double ray and link it to the core by a single edge without altering the inner ball, creating a 2‑way infinite bridge.
Corollary 10 (even‑regular comeagre bridgeless). In G_{\bullet,=D} with even D>2, every bridge is 2‑way infinite (finite‑side parity). Thus the bridged set equals P, meagre by Proposition 9. Therefore bridgeless is comeagre under d_• (and any topologically equivalent cylinder‑rich metric).

Consequences for the conjecture
- For odd D (≤D and =D): By Lemmas 3 and 6 with Lemma CR, bridgeless is nowhere dense under any cylinder‑rich (strongly local) metric. Weighted local metrics are cylinder‑rich (Lemma 1), hence typicality coincides with that under d_•.
- For even D in =D: Bridgeless is already comeagre (Corollary 10).
- For even D in ≤D: The sealed‑bubble mechanism cannot be used to force a 1‑edge finite cut (Proposition 7). Thus our current methods neither prove nor disprove nowhere‑denseness here; this is the remaining open regime for cylinder‑based topologies.

Examples
- D=3, =D: Take any 3‑regular finite R, delete one edge uv and add z adjacent to u,v so deg(z)=2, others 3. Attach as in Lemma 3; by is then a bridge in all completions. Apply Lemma 4 for an infinite 3‑regular completion.
- D=4, ≤D (odd‑style fails): Any attempt to seal a finite S to degree 4 and force a unique cross‑edge yields an empty cylinder by Proposition 7.

Next steps
- Formalize Lemma 2 fully (degree‑sequence feasibility and connectivity via standard regular graph existence and switchings). Package it for repeated use.
- Provide a completely explicit proof of Lemma 4 (detail the 2‑switching to avoid multiple edges and ensure connectivity while keeping degrees).
- Investigate ≤D with even D: either devise a different forcing (not relying on sealed finite sides) or prove an impossibility theorem that no cylinder refinement can force “has a bridge,” which would suggest that typicality might differ here across coarser/nonlocal topologies.
- If pursuing a metric change that flips typicality, move beyond cylinder‑rich: define an end‑aware inverse‑limit topology (basic clopens fixing an r‑ball plus counts of external rays per boundary vertex), prove it is metrizable and Baire, then attempt to show “no one‑edge finite cut” is comeagre there.

Summary
- Typicality is topological; weighted local and other strongly local metrics share the local topology and are cylinder‑rich, hence preserve typicality. We gave robust, local forcing of bridges in odd‑D regimes (≤D and =D) and meagreness of 2‑way bridges for all D>2, implying bridgeless is comeagre in even‑regular. We also proved an even‑D obstruction to sealed finite cuts in ≤D, clarifying limits of cylinder‑based forcing. The only plausible route to a metric changing bridge typicality appears to be via genuinely nonlocal, end‑sensitive topologies; their Baire/metrizability and bridge density remain to be established.
