Assessing and repairing the current write‑up: bridges, topology, and forcing

Overview
- I identify specific flaws in Lemma 13 and the proofs of Theorems 14–17, provide corrected statements, and supply rigorous local (cylinder‑based) forcing arguments. I also separate the odd/even D‑regular cases and clarify what can be transported to alternative metrics/topologies.

1) Foundational topology: cylinders and closure
- Cylinders are clopen in the local topology. If F is a realized r‑ball, G_•^F = {(G,ρ): B_r(G,ρ) ≅ F} is open by definition and closed because if x_n ∈ G_•^F and x_n → x in d_•, then B_r(x) ≅ F (for s ≤ r we eventually have B_s(x_n) ≅ B_s(x)). This should be recorded explicitly.
- Correct nowhere‑dense criterion. A set S is nowhere dense iff for every realized cylinder G_•^F there exists a realized cylinder G_•^{F′} ⊆ G_•^F with G_•^{F′} ∩ cl(S) = ∅. In our applications we construct G_•^{F′} ⊆ X \ S (stronger). The third bullet of Lemma 13 must be amended accordingly (it currently omits the closure).
- Nonemptiness of cylinders in G_{•,≤D}. If F is a realized r‑ball in G_{•,≤D}, then some boundary vertex v ∈ L_r(F) must satisfy deg_F(v) < D (otherwise the graph cannot be infinite). Conversely, any such F extends to an infinite ≤ D graph by attaching a tree outside. This sharpens the second bullet of Lemma 13.

2) Forcing a bridge in ≤ D: fix to Theorem 14(i)
Issue. “Attach a leaf to a boundary vertex” (as sketched) does not force a bridge: completions could add edges at that new vertex unless it lies strictly inside the cylinder’s fixed ball.

Lemma (finite pendant subtree forcing in ≤ D, all D ≥ 2). Let X = G_{•,≤D}. For any realized cylinder G_•^F (radius r ≥ 1), there exists R > r and a realized cylinder G_•^{F′} ⊆ G_•^F such that every (G,ρ) ∈ G_•^{F′} has a (1‑way infinite) bridge.
Proof. Choose a boundary vertex u ∈ L_r(F) with deg_F(u) < D. Outside B_r, build a finite pendant subtree T of size ≥ 2, attached to u by a single edge e, and place the entirety of T strictly inside B_R for some R > r (ensure every vertex of T lies at distance < R). Ensure also that at least one vertex of L_R(F′) retains residual degree < D (so infinite completions exist). Let F′ = B_R of this extension. In any completion with B_R fixed, no vertex of T can gain new edges (that would alter B_R), and T meets the rest of G only at u. Hence e is a bridge in every completion in G_•^{F′}. QED.
Consequences. This yields Theorem 14(i) for all D ≥ 2 in ≤ D: in every cylinder we find a subcylinder where every member has a bridge; hence the set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense. This is simpler and corrects the invalid boundary‑leaf argument.

3) Forcing a bridge in = D (odd D): correct gadget and proof of Theorem 14(ii)
Parity barrier (even D). In D‑regular graphs with even D, 1‑way infinite bridges cannot occur: if removing e leaves a finite component A, then ∑_{v∈A} deg_G(v) = D|A| − 1 (odd), contradicting that this sum equals 2|E(A)|.

Odd D saturated bubble. For odd D ≥ 3, we can force a bridge by sealing a finite side entirely within a ball:
- Construct H: Let m = D + 2 (odd). Take K_m, delete the edges of a Hamiltonian cycle C_m so every vertex now has degree D − 1, then add a maximum matching M leaving a prescribed vertex w unmatched (such a matching exists since m is odd). The resulting simple connected H has deg(w) = D − 1 and all other vertices degree D.
- Placement: Outside B_r(F), insert H completely within a larger ball B_R, disjoint from B_r, and add a single edge e = uw to a chosen boundary vertex u ∈ L_r(F). After adding e, every vertex of H has degree D already within B_R, so in any completion preserving B_R no new edges can attach to H; thus e is the unique cut‑edge between H and the rest, hence a bridge in every completion within the cylinder G_•^{F′}, F′ = B_R. Ensure nonemptiness by leaving residual capacity at some boundary vertex of L_R.
This rigorously establishes Theorem 14(ii) for odd D.

4) Two‑way infinite bridges are dense meagre (complete proof of Theorem 16)
Setup. Fix D > 2 and X ∈ {G_{•,≤D}, G_{•,=D}}. For k ∈ N, let P_k be the set of graphs having a 2‑way infinite bridge e with both endpoints in B_k.
- Nowhere dense at fixed k. Given G_•^{F} (radius r ≥ k), let E_k be edges of F with both endpoints in B_k. Call e ∈ E_k critical if F − e has both sides containing at least one boundary vertex in L_r(F) with residual degree (< D); otherwise e is safe. Safe e can never be a 2‑way infinite bridge in any completion of F (one side cannot become infinite). For the finitely many critical e, select a set S ⊆ L_r(F) containing one residual boundary vertex from each side of each critical e. Outside B_r attach, for each v ∈ S, a new vertex x_v adjacent to v, and connect the x_v in a single simple cycle C lying outside B_r. Let F′ = B_{r+2} of this extension. Then for each critical e = ab there are paths in F − e from a to some v_A ∈ S and from b to some v_B ∈ S on opposite sides; with C these yield a cycle through e entirely within B_{r+2}. Hence G_•^{F′} ⊆ G_•^{F} \ P_k. Nonemptiness is maintained by reserving at least one boundary stub (≤ D) or filling later (= D, see completion below). Thus P_k is nowhere dense.
- Meagreness. P = ⋃_k P_k is meagre.
- Density. For any cylinder G_•^{F} (radius r), extend outside B_r by attaching two disjoint infinite D‑bounded trees (≤ D) or D‑regular trees (= D after regular completion) and connect them by a single edge e far beyond radius r. Then e is a 2‑way infinite bridge; by choosing attachments beyond some R ≫ r we ensure B_r remains unchanged. Hence P is dense.
Conclusion. The set of graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge is dense meagre in both ≤ D and = D (D > 2).
Corollary (even D regular). In G_{•,=D} with even D, every bridge is 2‑way infinite (parity), so “has a bridge” is meagre; thus bridgeless graphs are comeagre in the local topology.

5) D‑regular completion lemma (to ensure nonempty cylinders in the = D constructions)
Lemma (D‑regular completion outside a finite ball). Let D ≥ 2. Suppose F′ is a finite rooted graph intended as a ball B_R with all vertices inside at distance < R having degree exactly D in F′, and boundary vertices v ∈ L_R(F′) having deg_{F′}(v) ≤ D. Then one can extend F′ to a connected infinite D‑regular simple graph G with B_R(G,ρ) ≅ F′.
Sketch proof. Let S be the multiset of boundary “stubs” consisting of D − deg_{F′}(v) copies of each v ∈ L_R(F′). Choose a connected infinite D‑regular simple graph H_out disjoint from F′ (e.g., a D‑regular Cayley graph). Partition S into pairs (if |S| is odd, enlarge R by one to adjust parity; for odd D this can always be arranged by a one‑layer buffer). For each pair {v_1, v_2}, pick two vertex‑disjoint edges y_1z_1, y_2z_2 in H_out with all endpoints distinct and far from each other and from previous choices. Replace these two edges by a 2‑switch: delete y_1z_1 and y_2z_2; add edges v_1y_1, v_2z_2, and z_1y_2. This keeps all degrees in H_out at D, increases deg(v_i) by 1 for i = 1,2, and introduces no edges inside B_R. Iterate over all pairs. The result is a connected infinite D‑regular simple graph extending F′ with the prescribed ball B_R. QED.
Remarks. The parity/two‑stub pairing is the only subtlety; it is harmless since we control R when forming F′ in our forcing steps (odd D: choose R so |S| is even; even D: our use is limited to the 2‑way bridge density proof and cut‑vertex forcing below, where pairing can be arranged similarly).

6) Theorem 15 (no cut vertex nowhere dense): details
- The sealed‑bubble idea adapts to articulation points in both ≤ D and = D. Inside a refined ball B_R, prepare two finite connected “blobs” H_1, H_2, each placed entirely within B_R, disjoint except for a single articulation vertex v, and ensure: (i) all vertices of each H_i other than v have degree D within B_R (in = D exact; in ≤ D at most D), (ii) no edges between H_1 \ {v} and H_2 \ {v} within B_R, and (iii) some boundary vertex in L_R has residual capacity to guarantee completions. In any completion preserving B_R, no edges can be added between the blobs (that would alter B_R), so v remains a cut vertex in every completion inside the cylinder G_•^{B_R}. Thus “no cut vertex” is nowhere dense.

7) Theorem 17 (edge‑chromatic number): current proof invalid
- The step “removing an edge preserves χ′ = D + 1 by parity” is false (e.g., K_3). To prove nowhere denseness of “χ′ = D” one needs a finite class‑II forcer H_D with χ′(H_D) = D + 1 such that any supergraph containing H_D as an induced subgraph satisfies χ′ ≥ D + 1, plus an embedding lemma respecting degree budgets in the cylinder. Candidates: overfull subgraphs (even D) and odd‑order D‑regular graphs (odd D), but one must show induced containment and degree‑saturation block any D‑edge‑coloring extension. Absent this, Theorem 17 should be marked open or reworked with a precise forcer and embedding.

8) Metric/topology sensitivity: what survives alternative metrics
- Typicality is purely topological. Equivalent metrics preserve it. Beyond that, one cannot rely on monotonicity under refinements/coarsenings. To legitimately transfer the cylinder‑forcing arguments to another metric/topology τ, require a strong locality property: for every τ‑open neighborhood U of x there exists an r with the local cylinder C(B_r(x)) ⊆ U. Call τ cylinder‑dominating. Then any property whose complement can be forced on subcylinders (as above) remains nowhere dense in τ: given nonempty U, pick a cylinder C ⊆ U and refine to C′ disjoint from the target set. This covers many “natural” local metrics (weighted sums of r‑ball tests, FO‑local metrics) provided they are Polish/Baire. In such topologies, bridgeless remains nowhere dense in ≤ D and in = D with odd D; for even D regular, bridgeless is already comeagre under the local topology.
- Nonlocal metrics/topologies (recording, e.g., global end structure or a “has a bridge” bit) can alter openness but must be shown metrizable and Baire before making typicality claims. The write‑up should either propose a concrete nonlocal Baire topology or restrict claims to cylinder‑dominating families.

9) Examples and quick checks
- ≤ D, even D: The pendant subtree forcing inside the ball works and avoids parity issues; it shows bridgeless is nowhere dense (Theorem 14(i)) without degree saturation.
- = D, even D: Parity forbids 1‑way bridges; with the dense‑meagre result for 2‑way bridges, bridgeless is comeagre.
- = D, odd D: The K_{D+2} − C + M bubble forcing works; a short cubic (D=3) instance can be written explicitly.

10) Obstacles and next steps
- Formalize the D‑regular completion lemma with explicit pairing and 2‑switches; add a brief parity note on arranging |S| even by adjusting R for odd D.
- Amend Lemma 13 (closure) and state the clopen cylinder fact explicitly.
- Replace Theorem 14 proofs with: (i) pendant subtree forcing for ≤ D; (ii) saturated bubble for odd D in = D; (iii) parity corollary (even D regular) yielding bridgeless comeagre.
- Provide full details for Theorem 16 as written above, including the = D case using the completion lemma.
- For Theorem 15 include the explicit articulation forcing with degree saturation inside the ball.
- Either supply a valid finite class‑II forcer and embedding for Theorem 17 or mark as open.
- If pursuing alternative metrics, fix a class (e.g., cylinder‑dominating) and prove it is Polish/Baire and that the forcing arguments carry over verbatim.

Concise corrected picture
- ≤ D (all D ≥ 2): Bridgeless is nowhere dense via pendant subtree forcing inside the cylinder.
- = D, odd D: Bridgeless is nowhere dense via saturated bubble forcing (explicit H from K_{D+2} − C + M) plus completion lemma.
- = D, even D: Bridgeless is comeagre (2‑way bridges are dense meagre; 1‑way bridges impossible by parity).
- Theorem 17 requires a new forcer; current parity argument is invalid.
- Under any cylinder‑dominating alternative metric/topology, these typicality conclusions persist; genuine changes require nonlocal topologies whose Baire properties and densities must be established first.
