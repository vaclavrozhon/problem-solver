  "summary_md": "Last round replaced the invalid leaf\u2011forcing with two robust forcing methods and consolidated typicality conclusions across natural local metrics. Main technical tools: (i) sealed\u2011bubble forcing \u2014 attach a finite D\u2011saturated block H by a single edge so H has no spare stubs; that edge is then a bridge in every admissible extension (works for =D when D is odd and for \u2264D if implemented with care); (ii) interior pendant\u2011subtree forcing \u2014 place a finite pendant path/subtree strictly inside a larger ball so the attaching edge is a bridge in all completions (works in G_{\u2022,\u2264D} for all D\u22652). Parity blocks sealed one\u2011edge cuts when D is even, but we prove 2\u2011way infinite bridges are dense yet meagre for D>2; hence in =D with even D bridgeless graphs are comeagre. Under any strongly\u2011local / cylinder\u2011open (Polish/Baire) topology (including d_\u2022 and typical weighted/FO\u2011local variants) these forcing arguments imply: bridgeless is nowhere dense in G_{\u2022,\u2264D} (all D) and in G_{\u2022,=D} for odd D, while bridgeless is comeagre in =D for even D. Remaining work: formalize boundary data/base and D\u2011regular completion lemmas, and investigate genuine nonlocal Baire metrics that could flip typicality.",

  "highlights": [
    "Sealed\u2011bubble forcing: build a finite D\u2011saturated block H attached by one edge; H has no spare stubs so the connecting edge is a bridge in every extension (valid for odd D regular).",
    "Interior pendant\u2011subtree forcing: place a finite pendant path/subtree strictly inside a larger ball so its attachment edge is a forced bridge in all completions \u2014 works in G_{\u2022,\u2264D} for every D\u22652.",
    "Parity obstruction: when D is even a sealed one\u2011edge finite cut is impossible (cut size parity), so the sealed\u2011bubble method fails; nevertheless 2\u2011way bridges are dense but meagre for D>2.",
    "Category conclusions (strongly\u2011local / cylinder\u2011open metrics): bridgeless is nowhere dense in G_{\u2022,\u2264D} (all D) and in G_{\u2022,=D} for odd D; bridgeless is comeagre in =D when D is even.",
    "Nonlocal metrics can trivially change openness (e.g. add a global \u201chas a bridge\u201d bit); any meaningful alternate metric must be shown metrizable/Baire and have different cylinder\u2011density behavior."
