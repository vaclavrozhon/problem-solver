Last round replaced the invalid leaf‑forcing with two robust forcing methods and consolidated typicality conclusions across natural local metrics. Main technical tools: (i) sealed‑bubble forcing — attach a finite D‑saturated block H by a single edge so H has no spare stubs; that edge is then a bridge in every admissible extension (works for =D when D is odd and for ≤D if implemented with care); (ii) interior pendant‑subtree forcing — place a finite pendant path/subtree strictly inside a larger ball so the attaching edge is a bridge in all completions (works in G_{•,≤D} for all D≥2). Parity blocks sealed one‑edge cuts when D is even, but we prove 2‑way infinite bridges are dense yet meagre for D>2; hence in =D with even D bridgeless graphs are comeagre. Under any strongly‑local / cylinder‑open (Polish/Baire) topology (including d_• and typical weighted/FO‑local variants) these forcing arguments imply: bridgeless is nowhere dense in G_{•,≤D} (all D) and in G_{•,=D} for odd D, while bridgeless is comeagre in =D for even D. Remaining work: formalize boundary data/base and D‑regular completion lemmas, and investigate genuine nonlocal Baire metrics that could flip typicality.
