{"summary_md":"Last round replaced the invalid leaf‑forcing with two robust forcing methods and consolidated typicality conclusions across natural local metrics. Main technical tools: (i) sealed‑bubble forcing — attach a finite D‑saturated block H by a single edge so H has no spare stubs; that edge is then a bridge in every admissible extension (works for =D when D is odd and for ≤D if implemented with care); (ii) interior pendant‑subtree forcing — place a finite pendant path/subtree strictly inside a larger ball so the attaching edge is a bridge in all completions (works in G_{•,≤D} for all D≥2). Parity blocks sealed one‑edge cuts when D is even, but we prove 2‑way infinite bridges are dense yet meagre for D>2; hence in =D with even D bridgeless graphs are comeagre. Under any strongly‑local / cylinder‑open (Polish/Baire) topology (including d_• and typical weighted/FO‑local variants) these forcing arguments imply: bridgeless is nowhere dense in G_{•,≤D} (all D) and in G_{•,=D} for odd D, while bridgeless is comeagre in =D for even D. Remaining work: formalize boundary data/base and D‑regular completion lemmas, and investigate genuine nonlocal Baire metrics that could flip typicality.","one_line_summary":"Sealed‑bubble and pendant‑subtree forcing: bridgeless nowhere dense (odd D); even‑D regular comeagre","highlights":["Sealed‑bubble forcing: build a finite D‑saturated block H attached by one edge; H has no spare stubs so the connecting edge is a bridge in every extension (valid for odd D regular).","Interior pendant‑subtree forcing: place a finite pendant path/subtree strictly inside a larger ball so its attachment edge is a forced bridge in all completions — works in G_{•,≤D} for every D≥2.","Parity obstruction: when D is even a sealed one‑edge finite cut is impossible (cut size parity), so the sealed‑bubble method fails; nevertheless 2‑way bridges are dense but meagre for D>2.","Category conclusions (strongly‑local / cylinder‑open metrics): bridgeless is nowhere dense in G_{•,≤D} (all D) and in G_{•,=D} for odd D; bridgeless is comeagre in =D when D is even.","Nonlocal metrics can trivially change openness (e.g. add a global “has a bridge” bit); any meaningful alternate metric must be shown metrizable/Baire and have different cylinder‑density behavior."],"next_questions":["Formalize the boundary datum Π and prove the tame / cylinder‑open topology is Polish (countable base A(F,Π), Baire property).","Construct an explicit odd‑D D‑regular sealed‑bubble gadget and prove an infinite D‑regular completion lemma realizing the refined ball.","Decide bridgeless typicality in G_{•,≤D} for even D under cylinder‑based methods or find a natural nonlocal Baire metric that (provably) makes bridgeless typical." ]}
