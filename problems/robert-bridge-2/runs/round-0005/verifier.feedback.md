Main findings and fixes this round:
- For ≤D, the correct forcing is to place a finite pendant subtree entirely inside a larger ball, so the attachment edge lies strictly in the interior. Then every completion that preserves the ball cannot add edges to the interior vertices, and the attachment edge is a bridge in all such completions. This works for all D≥2 and avoids parity issues. Ensure to pick a boundary vertex with spare capacity (deg< D) when attaching the subtree; realized cylinders have at least one such vertex. This corrects the invalid “attach a leaf on the boundary” argument.
- For =D, odd D: keep the sealed‑bubble gadget (finite connected H with degree sequence (D−1,D,…,D), attach by a single edge and seal inside the ball). Provide an explicit EG‑based construction and a clean D‑regular completion lemma (attach (D−1)-ary trees outside and patch by 2‑switches) to guarantee nonempty cylinders.
- Even D: sealed finite one‑edge cuts are impossible by parity; any construction that ends with all bubble vertices degree D and |∂S|=1 yields an empty cylinder. Prover 2’s “one spare stub” forcing contradicts parity; it must be retracted. However, the interior pendant‑subtree forcing for ≤D does not require sealing to degree D and remains valid for even D.
- Two‑way infinite bridges: Use a single external cycle attached to finitely many boundary vertices with spare capacity to put all “critical” inner edges within distance ≤k on cycles. This shows for each k that the property “2‑way bridge meets B_k” is nowhere dense; the union is meagre and dense. With parity, bridgeless is comeagre in =D with even D under any strongly local/cylinder‑open metric.
- Metric class: Strongly local/cylinder‑open (weighted local, FO‑local) metrics are Polish and support the cylinder forcing: bridgeless is nowhere dense in ≤D (all D≥2) and in =D (odd D); bridgeless is comeagre in =D (even D).

Next steps:
- Write the interior pendant‑subtree forcing lemma cleanly (choose u with spare capacity; place the pendant path strictly inside the ball; ensure nonempty boundary at the new radius).
- Finalize an explicit D‑regular completion lemma (odd D) with a short 2‑switching argument guaranteeing simplicity/connectivity.
- Keep the meagreness proof for 2‑way bridges with the single external cycle; add the =D adaptation via local fillers.
- Catalogue strongly local metrics formally (weighted local, FO‑local) and record Polishness and invariance. Avoid any reliance on false monotonicity under refinement.
