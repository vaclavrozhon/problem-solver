  "feedback_md": "Main findings and fixes this round:\n- For \u2264D, the correct forcing is to place a finite pendant subtree entirely inside a larger ball, so the attachment edge lies strictly in the interior. Then every completion that preserves the ball cannot add edges to the interior vertices, and the attachment edge is a bridge in all such completions. This works for all D\u22652 and avoids parity issues. Ensure to pick a boundary vertex with spare capacity (deg< D) when attaching the subtree; realized cylinders have at least one such vertex. This corrects the invalid \u201cattach a leaf on the boundary\u201d argument.\n- For =D, odd D: keep the sealed\u2011bubble gadget (finite connected H with degree sequence (D\u22121,D,\u2026,D), attach by a single edge and seal inside the ball). Provide an explicit EG\u2011based construction and a clean D\u2011regular completion lemma (attach (D\u22121)-ary trees outside and patch by 2\u2011switches) to guarantee nonempty cylinders.\n- Even D: sealed finite one\u2011edge cuts are impossible by parity; any construction that ends with all bubble vertices degree D and |\u2202S|=1 yields an empty cylinder. Prover 2\u2019s \u201cone spare stub\u201d forcing contradicts parity; it must be retracted. However, the interior pendant\u2011subtree forcing for \u2264D does not require sealing to degree D and remains valid for even D.\n- Two\u2011way infinite bridges: Use a single external cycle attached to finitely many boundary vertices with spare capacity to put all \u201ccritical\u201d inner edges within distance \u2264k on cycles. This shows for each k that the property \u201c2\u2011way bridge meets B_k\u201d is nowhere dense; the union is meagre and dense. With parity, bridgeless is comeagre in =D with even D under any strongly local/cylinder\u2011open metric.\n- Metric class: Strongly local/cylinder\u2011open (weighted local, FO\u2011local) metrics are Polish and support the cylinder forcing: bridgeless is nowhere dense in \u2264D (all D\u22652) and in =D (odd D); bridgeless is comeagre in =D (even D).\n\nNext steps:\n- Write the interior pendant\u2011subtree forcing lemma cleanly (choose u with spare capacity; place the pendant path strictly inside the ball; ensure nonempty boundary at the new radius).\n- Finalize an explicit D\u2011regular completion lemma (odd D) with a short 2\u2011switching argument guaranteeing simplicity/connectivity.\n- Keep the meagreness proof for 2\u2011way bridges with the single external cycle; add the =D adaptation via local fillers.\n- Catalogue strongly local metrics formally (weighted local, FO\u2011local) and record Polishness and invariance. Avoid any reliance on false monotonicity under refinement.\n",

Given a cylinder C(F) with radius r, pick a boundary vertex u with deg_F(u)<D. Extend to radius R\u226br by attaching a finite pendant path P to u and placing P strictly inside B_R (no vertex of P lies on L_R). In any completion with B_R fixed, vertices of P cannot gain new neighbors, so the attachment edge e=up_1 is a bridge. Ensure nonemptiness of the refined cylinder by adding a fresh leaf at distance R.\n- =D, odd D: Keep the sealed\u2011bubble gadget (finite H with degree sequence (D\u22121,D,\u2026,D), attached by one edge and entirely inside the ball). This forces a bridge in all D\u2011regular completions.

    "content": "Lemma (Interior pendant\u2011subtree forcing in G_{\u2022,\u2264D} for all D\u22652).\nLet D\u22652 and let C(F) be a realized cylinder in G_{\u2022,\u2264D} with radius r. Then there exists R>r and a realized cylinder C(F\u2032)\u2286C(F) such that every (G,\u03c1)\u2208C(F\u2032) contains a bridge.\nProof. Since C(F) is realized by infinite graphs with \u0394\u2264D and preserves B_r, some boundary vertex u\u2208L_r(F) has deg_F(u)<D. Choose L\u22652. Form F\u2032 by adjoining a simple path P=u p_1 p_2 \u2026 p_L outside B_r and choosing R:=r+L+1 so that every vertex of P lies at distance \u2264R\u22121 from the root (hence P\u2282int(B_R)). To ensure nonemptiness of C(F\u2032), add a fresh leaf y attached to some vertex z at distance R\u22121 (for instance z=p_L), so y lies on L_R(F\u2032) with degree 1< D. Then C(F\u2032)\u2286C(F) and is nonempty. In any completion (G,\u03c1) with B_R(G,\u03c1)\u2245F\u2032, no vertex of P can gain new neighbors (else B_R would change), and within B_R the only edge between V(P) and V(B_R)\\V(P) is e=up_1. Hence removing e disconnects G, i.e., e is a (1\u2011way infinite) bridge.\u220e\n\nLemma (Two\u2011way bridges are meagre and dense in G_{\u2022,D} for D>2).\nFor k\u2208N, let P_k be the set of rooted graphs having a 2\u2011way infinite bridge meeting B_k. Then each P_k is nowhere dense in G_{\u2022,D}, and P:=\u22c3_{k}P_k is meagre and dense.\nProof. Fix k and a realized cylinder C(F) with radius r\u2265k. Let E_k be the finite set of edges of F whose distance to the root is \u2264k. Call e\u2208E_k safe if, in F\u2212e, at least one component contains no boundary vertex v\u2208L_r(F) with deg_F(v)<D; otherwise e is critical. A safe e cannot be a 2\u2011way infinite bridge in any completion of C(F), because one side has no capacity to become infinite while preserving B_r. For the critical edges, choose a finite set S\u2286L_r(F) that contains at least one boundary vertex (with spare capacity) from each side of every critical e. Refine F by, for each v\u2208S, adding one new neighbor x_v at distance r+1, and connecting the set {x_v:v\u2208S} into a single simple cycle using fresh vertices at distance r+2. Let F\u2032:=B_{r+2} of this extension. Then for each critical e=ab there are paths in F\u2212e from a to some v_A\u2208S and from b to some v_B\u2208S on opposite sides; the external cycle yields a v_A\u2013v_B path outside B_r, so e lies on a cycle contained in B_{r+2}(F\u2032). Therefore no e\u2208E_k is a bridge in any completion with B_{r+2} fixed, and C(F\u2032)\u2286C(F)\u2216P_k. Nonemptiness is maintained by reserving at least one fresh boundary stub (e.g., keep one new cycle vertex of degree 2) to allow infinite continuation beyond radius r+2. Thus P_k is nowhere dense. Hence P is meagre. For density, given any cylinder C(F) (radius r), extend far outside B_r by attaching two disjoint infinite \u0394\u2264D trees (or D\u2011regular trees in the =D case after local completion) and connect them by a single edge e; connect the core to exactly one of the trees by a long path. This keeps B_r unchanged and makes e a 2\u2011way infinite bridge, proving density.\u220e\n\nCorollary (Even D\u2011regular comeagre bridgeless).\nIn G_{\u2022,=D} with even D, every bridge is 2\u2011way infinite. By the lemma, graphs with a 2\u2011way bridge form a meagre set; hence bridgeless graphs are comeagre.\n"
