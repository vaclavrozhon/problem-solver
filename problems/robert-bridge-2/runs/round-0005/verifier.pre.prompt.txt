=== SYSTEM ===
You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md, proofs.md, and output.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers
- notes.md (informal progress & exploratory work so far)
- proofs.md (rigorous proofs & detailed mathematics so far)
- output.md (main results found so far)

**Three-tier file system guidelines**:
- **notes.md**: Readable, log of exploratory work, intuitions, failed attempts, ideas. Prefer appending. Replace only if old notes are clearly misleading. It should be self-contained: In particular, reading it should make sense without knowing the output of provers in past rounds. 

- **proofs.md**: Complete rigorous mathematical proofs with full details. Think twice before adding anything. Contains proven lemmas, theorems, and detailed derivations. Only add mathematically verified content here.
- **output.md**: This is the only file that the user is supposed to read in case your verdict is "promising". It has to be self-contained. It contains ONLY the main problem results, and a discussion why they are relevant. It is extremely selective. Think twice before promoting proofs from proofs.md to output.md. Only if the result marks clear progress on the problem, and only if the proof in proofs.md has been thoroughly vetted by provers and you, it can join output.md. Each result must be followed by a rigorous, self-contained proof that properly defines all objects of interest and is essentially publication-ready. 

Tasks:
1) Audit rigor: identify unjustified steps, false statements, missing lemmas; produce minimal counterexamples.
2) Triage value: separate genuine progress from noise.
3) Guide next steps: propose what provers should try next.

## Setting

- Fix an integer \(D \ge 2\).
- Let \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) be the space of **countably infinite, connected, rooted graphs** \((G,\rho)\).
- For \((G,\rho) \in \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) and \(r \in \mathbb{N}\), let \(B_r(G,\rho)\) denote the rooted (closed) ball of radius \(r\) about \(\rho\).
- Equip \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) with the **local (Benjamini–Schramm) metric** \(d_\bullet\) given by
  \[
  d_\bullet\big((G,\rho),(H,\sigma)\big)=2^{-R},
  \qquad
  R=\sup\{r\in\mathbb{N} : B_r(G,\rho)\cong B_r(H,\sigma)\}.
  \]
  (Equivalently, \(d_\bullet((G,\rho),(H,\sigma))<2^{-r}\) iff \(B_r(G,\rho)\cong B_r(H,\sigma)\).)
- Degree‑constrained subspaces:
  - \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\): all rooted graphs with \(\Delta(G)\le D\).
  - \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,= D}\): all rooted graphs with \(\Delta(G)= D\).
  We write \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for either of these when the distinction is unimportant.
- A subset \(S\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) is **nowhere dense** if the interior of \(\overline{S}\) is empty. A set is **meagre** (first category) if it is a countable union of nowhere dense sets; its complement is **comeagre**. A property is called **typical** if the corresponding set is comeagre.
- An edge \(e\) of an (unrooted) graph \(G\) is a **bridge** if \(G-e\) has more connected components than \(G\). A bridge is **2‑way infinite** if both components are infinite and **1‑way infinite** otherwise.

---
Prove or disprove:


## Conjecture — Metric sensitivity of typicality
There exists a **natural alternative metric** on the same underlying set \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for which the collection of **typical properties** differs from those under \(d_\bullet\). In particular, determine whether there is a reasonable metric in which **bridgeless graphs are typical**, or prove that no such metric can change their typicality.

# Research Notes



Working hypothesis: Robustness of bridge atypicality under tame topologies.

Definitions (to be formalized):
- A tame topology on X=G_{\bullet,D} has a countable base consisting of sets A(F,Π), where F is a rooted r-ball and Π is a finite boundary datum on a finite subset S of the boundary L_r(F). Π should specify: (i) residual degree budget at each v∈S (an integer in [0,D−deg_F(v)]), and (ii) finitely many local forbiddances of new adjacencies between specified boundary atoms; any completion must respect these.
- Basic cylinders C(F)=\{G: B_r(G)≅F\} are special cases A(F,∅). The topology is required to be generated by these A(F,Π), and the space should be Polish (hence Baire).

Goal: For all tame τ and for X=G_{\bullet,≤D} (D>2) and X=G_{\bullet,=D} with odd D, the bridgeless set is nowhere dense. For even D regular, bridgeless is already comeagre under d_• (1‑way bridges impossible; 2‑way bridges meagre), so no flip is needed.

Bridge‑forcing sketch (≤D):
- Given nonempty A(F,Π), extend F to a larger ball F′ by attaching a finite tree gadget T outside a buffered annulus so that exactly one edge e crosses from F‑side to T‑side, and saturate degrees of all vertices on both sides that could create additional outside connections. Ensure T is disjoint from S so Π is unaffected.
- In any completion respecting Π, degrees on the cut interface are saturated; hence no new outside edge can connect T to the rest, and e remains the unique cut‑edge, i.e., a bridge. Also leave ample unsaturated boundary elsewhere to admit infinite completions.

Odd D regular gadget: Replace the degree‑saturation by a D‑regular odd gadget ensuring a unique cut‑edge while keeping all degrees exactly D. To be written in full detail (parity bookkeeping, buffer, and compatibility with Π).

Planned verification checklists:
- Precisely define Π and show A(F,Π) form a base; prove nonemptiness criteria and that the space is Polish.
- Show common “finite‑coding” metrics (weighted sums of finitely many r‑ball tests) are tame.
- Write the bridge‑forcing lemma rigorously for ≤D and odd D regular.
- Explore whether logical/Stone topologies are tame; if not, test whether bridge‑forcing still yields nowhere denseness.


Agenda and corrections

- Robust bridge forcing: Attaching a leaf or a short pendant path does NOT force a bridge in all extensions, since extensions may add edges at the leaf. Correct forcing uses a finite D‑saturated bubble on one side: build a finite connected subgraph H whose vertices all have degree D (in \le D) or exactly D (in =D), except a designated vertex w with degree D−1 inside H; connect w to a boundary vertex u in the core by a single edge e=uw. Saturate all vertices of H (including w after adding e) to degree D within the prescribed ball, and do not add any other edges between H and the core. Then in every extension respecting the degree bound, no new edges can be added at H, so e remains the unique edge across the cut and is a bridge. The H side is finite; the other side can be extended to infinity via other boundary vertices.
- Cylinder‑rich topologies: We call a topology cylinder‑rich if for every open neighborhood U of x there exists r with the cylinder {y: B_r(y)≅B_r(x)} contained in U. This covers the local metric and many natural local metrics (weighted multi‑radius edit distances, etc.). In any cylinder‑rich topology, the above gadget yields a cylinder on which every graph has a bridge, so bridgeless sets are nowhere dense in G_{•,≤D} and in G_{•,=D} for odd D.
- Even D‑regular parity: In D‑regular graphs with even D, every bridge is 2‑way infinite; 1‑way infinite bridges are impossible by degree‑sum parity on a finite component.
- Nonlocal attempts: Adding a global boolean “has a bridge” coordinate makes that property open and cannot render “bridgeless” typical. An end‑sensitive topology may alter typicality but needs proof of metrizability/Baire property and density arguments to rule out 1‑edge cuts.

Open tasks
- Formalize the saturated‑bubble construction in regular (=D) odd case, including existence of infinite D‑regular extensions realizing the refined ball.
- Prove (or refute) that “has a 2‑way infinite bridge” is meagre in ≤D and =D; this would imply comeagre bridgeless for even D.
- Specify and study a natural nonlocal, Baire topology (e.g., end‑profile inverse limit) where bridgeless might be typical; verify all topological properties first.

Refinements and corrections to the topology and forcing scheme

- Cylinder‑open vs cylinder‑rich: For invariance of nowhere‑denseness across alternative metrics/topologies, we require that the new topology contains the local (Benjamini–Schramm) cylinders as open sets (call such topologies cylinder‑open). The weaker condition that each open set contains some local cylinder (cylinder‑rich) is insufficient to transfer category statements.

- Robust bridge forcing (final): Pendant leaves do not force bridges. Use a finite saturated bubble H attached by a single edge e to the core so that every vertex of H has degree D within the prescribed ball (and degree exactly D in the =D case). Then e remains a bridge in every completion. This works uniformly in ≤D and in =D for odd D; it is impossible for even D in the =D case due to parity (only 2‑way bridges can occur).

- 2‑way infinite bridges (D>2): For each k, the property “there is a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance ≤k” is nowhere dense. Construction: inside any cylinder, classify edges within distance ≤k as safe (one side has no boundary vertex with residual degree <D, hence cannot become infinite in any completion) or critical (both sides have a boundary vertex with residual degree). For critical edges, add one new neighbor to each such boundary vertex and link all these new neighbors into a single external cycle just outside the base radius; then each critical edge lies on a finite cycle entirely within a slightly larger ball. This yields meagreness of the union over k, and density follows by attaching two infinite branches connected by a single edge far outside.

- Even D‑regular: By parity, bridges are necessarily 2‑way infinite; with the meagreness above, bridgeless graphs are comeagre under the local topology.

Open items
- Provide a canonical odd‑regular finite bubble (e.g., a chain of K_{D+1}−e gadgets) and a clean extension existence lemma in =D.
- Catalog natural alternative metrics that are cylinder‑open (equivalent reweightings, FO‑local, decorated locals) and record invariance. Investigate genuinely nonlocal, Baire topologies if one seeks a change in typicality.

Two-way infinite bridges are dense meagre; bridgeless is comeagre for even D-regular

Setup: For D>2, fix k and let P_k be the set of rooted graphs that have a 2-way infinite bridge at distance ≤k. For any realized r-ball F with r≥k, construct an extension H by attaching, to each boundary vertex v with deg_F(v)<D, a new vertex x_v at distance r+1 and then connecting the x_v along a single cycle via additional new vertices outside B_r. Choose the construction so that at least one new vertex (on the outside cycle) still has residual degree to allow an infinite continuation; this ensures nonemptiness of the refined cylinder.

Key observations:
- If, in F−e, one side of an edge e at distance ≤k contains no boundary vertex with residual degree, then in any completion within the cylinder C(F) that side cannot become infinite, so e can never be a 2-way infinite bridge.
- Otherwise, pick boundary vertices v_A and v_B with residual degree on the two sides. In H there is a path from v_A to v_B outside B_r, so every such e lies on a cycle contained in B_{r+2}(H). Therefore, with F′=B_{r+2}(H), the cylinder C(F′) contains no graph from P_k.
Thus P_k is nowhere dense. Taking P=⋃_k P_k, we get that the set of graphs with a 2-way infinite bridge is meagre. The same construction shows P is dense by adding, in any cylinder, a far-away double ray connected by a single edge. For even D-regular graphs, any bridge is 2-way infinite; hence bridgeless is comeagre under the local topology.

Cylinder-rich (strongly local) topologies: A topology is cylinder‑rich if every open neighborhood around x contains a local cylinder C(B_r(x)). In any such topology, the sealed finite-component (“saturated bubble”) forcing shows bridgeless is nowhere dense in G_{•,≤D} and in G_{•,=D} for odd D. This covers many natural local metrics (weighted sums of r-ball disagreements, FO-local, edit-on-balls).

Consolidation: cylinder‑rich invariance and bridge forcing

- Cylinder‑rich topologies: We adopt the hypothesis that every open neighborhood around x contains some local cylinder C(B_r(x)). This includes the Benjamini–Schramm topology and many natural local metrics (weighted sums over r‑ball disagreements, FO‑local metrics). Under this hypothesis, any property whose complement can be forced by refining a cylinder is nowhere dense.

- Sealed‑bubble forcing (≤D, odd =D): Replace pendant leaves by a finite D‑saturated bubble H attached to the core by a single edge e. All vertices of H have total degree D inside the chosen ball (in =D, exactly D). No completion can add edges incident to H without changing the ball or violating degrees; hence e remains a bridge in every completion. For ≤D the existence of H with degree sequence (D,…,D,D−1) follows by Erdős–Gallai with n chosen so Dn is odd, plus Hakimi’s connectivity criterion; for odd D regular, an explicit gadget H arises from K_{D+2} minus a Hamiltonian cycle plus a maximum matching leaving one unmatched vertex.

- Two‑way bridges: For each k, classify edges at distance ≤k in a cylinder as safe (one side has no boundary vertex with residual capacity) or critical (both sides do). Only boundary vertices can connect to the outside while preserving the r‑ball, so safe edges cannot become 2‑way bridges. For critical edges, attach an external cycle through selected boundary vertices to place each such edge on a finite cycle within a slightly larger ball. Hence P_k is nowhere dense; ⋃_k P_k is meagre and dense.

- Even D regular: By parity, 1‑way bridges are impossible; combining with the meagreness of 2‑way bridges shows bridgeless is comeagre under the local topology (and any equivalent cylinder‑rich metric).

To‑dos: finalize the explicit existence proofs for H (≤D via EG+Hakimi; odd =D via K_{D+2} construction) and the D‑regular infinite completion lemma (2‑switch with edges outside H). Catalogue cylinder‑rich metrics and record Polish/Baire status.

Parity and forcing summary; metric class and current status

- Forcing bridges: Pendant leaves do not force a bridge. Use a sealed finite bubble S fully inside a ball: saturate all vertices of S to degree D within the ball and attach S to the core by a single edge e. Then in any completion respecting the ball, no new edges can be added at S, so e remains a bridge.
- Parity obstruction (even D): In any graph where every vertex of a finite set S has degree D (even), the cut size |∂S| must be even. Hence |∂S|=1 is impossible. Therefore the sealed‑bubble forcing cannot work for even D (including ≤D), explaining why leaf‑forcing fails.
- Odd D: The sealed‑bubble method works in both ≤D and =D. A finite connected simple graph with degree sequence (D,…,D,D−1) exists (EG), so joining its D−1 vertex by one edge to the core yields a bridge in all completions.
- 2‑way infinite bridges: For each k, shield every edge within distance ≤k by attaching a single new neighbor to each boundary vertex with residual capacity and connecting these new neighbors in one external cycle. Then those inner edges lie on cycles in any completion of the refined ball. Hence “2‑way infinite bridge at distance ≤k” is nowhere dense; the union over k is meagre. The set is also dense by adding a far‑away double ray with a single connector.
- Even D‑regular: Parity forbids 1‑way bridges; with the meagreness of 2‑way bridges, bridgeless is comeagre under the local topology.
- Metric class: Strongly local (cylinder‑dominating) metrics: small d‑balls sit inside some local cylinder. Weighted local and FO‑local metrics are of this type and Polish. In any such metric, the odd‑D sealed‑bubble forcing shows bridgeless is nowhere dense in ≤D (odd D) and =D (odd D).

Open items
- Provide a clean D‑regular completion lemma (odd D) to realize refined balls as infinite D‑regular graphs.
- Clarify the status of bridgeless nowhere denseness in ≤D for even D (likely impossible via cylinder‑based forcing due to parity). 
- Catalogue natural metrics in the strongly local class; for any nonlocal candidates, first prove Baire/Polish and then revisit forcing/density.

Status checkpoint

- Robust forcing: Pendant leaves do not force bridges. Use a sealed finite bubble S inside a fixed ball: every vertex in S attains degree D within the ball (exactly D in =D), and S connects to the core by a single edge e. Then e is a bridge in every completion preserving the ball. This works for odd D; for even D, parity implies |∂S| is even, so a 1‑edge cut cannot be sealed by degree saturation.
- Two‑way bridges: For each k, refine any cylinder by attaching one new neighbor to each boundary vertex with residual capacity and joining these new vertices by a single external cycle. Then every inner edge at distance ≤k lies on a finite cycle; hence “2‑way bridge within distance ≤k” is nowhere dense. The union over k is meagre and dense.
- Typicality summary: In =D with even D, bridgeless is comeagre (no 1‑way bridges; 2‑way bridges meagre). In odd D (≤D and =D), bridgeless is nowhere dense under any strongly local/cylinder‑open metric. The case ≤D with even D remains open with current methods.
- Metrics: Strongly local/cylinder‑open metrics (e.g., weighted local, FO‑local) are Polish and admit the forcing/refinement arguments above. Any change in typicality would require genuinely nonlocal topologies; Baire/metrizability must be established first.

To‑dos: finalize a clean D‑regular completion lemma; formalize the strongly local class and list examples; investigate impossibility of cylinder‑based forcing in ≤D for even D.

Consolidated status on bridges and metrics

- Correct forcing principle: A pendant leaf does not force a bridge. Use a sealed finite bubble S entirely within a bounded ball: saturate every vertex of S to degree D within the ball (exactly D in =D), and attach S to the core by a single edge. For odd D this forces a bridge in every completion; Erdős–Gallai supplies a finite bubble with degree sequence (D−1,D,…,D), and infinite completions exist by attaching (D−1)-ary trees.
- Even D obstruction: If D is even and every vertex in finite S has degree D in the final graph, then the cut size |∂S| must be even. Thus a single cross-edge cut cannot occur. Any ‘one spare stub’ variant that forces exactly one cross-edge yields an empty cylinder by parity; such constructions cannot witness nowhere‑denseness for even D in ≤D.
- Two‑way bridges: For D>2 and each k, refine any cylinder by attaching one new neighbor to finitely many boundary vertices with spare capacity and connecting those new neighbors in a single external cycle. Then every edge within distance ≤k lies on a cycle; hence “2‑way bridge at distance ≤k” is nowhere dense. The union over k is meagre, and the set is dense by adding a far‑away double ray with a single connector.
- Metric class: Strongly local (cylinder‑dominating) metrics (e.g., weighted sums over r‑ball disagreements; FO‑local via Gaifman locality) are Polish and preserve the forcing arguments. In these, bridgeless is nowhere dense for odd D (≤D and =D), while for even D‑regular it is already comeagre.

Open: Settle bridgeless typicality in ≤D for even D (likely requires a new idea or an impossibility theorem). Formalize the strongly‑local class and finalize the odd‑D regular completion details.

Ideas
- Repair and generalize the forcing for ≤D: “attach a leaf” fails because the leaf sits on the boundary of the refined ball and can gain new edges in completions. The correct forcing is to attach a finite pendant path entirely inside a larger ball so that the attachment edge lies strictly in the interior; then every completion preserves it as a 1‑way infinite bridge. This works for all D>2 and avoids parity obstructions (we do not saturate degrees to D on the finite side; the cylinder’s interior forbids new edges there).
- Package this with a general invariance lemma for strongly local, cylinder‑open metrics to conclude: in X=G_{•,≤D} (D>2), “bridgeless” is nowhere dense for any such metric. In X=G_{•,=D} with odd D, use the sealed‑bubble gadget as before. Even D regular remains comeagre bridgeless by the meagreness of 2‑way bridges and parity.
- We also formalize the D‑regular completion lemma (odd D) and the 2‑way bridge shielding in a succinct, verifiable way.

Definitions
- Strongly local, cylinder‑open metric: A metric d on X is strongly local if ∃ψ:(0,1]→ℕ with d(x,y)<ε ⇒ B_{ψ(ε)}(x)≅B_{ψ(ε)}(y), and cylinder‑open if every local cylinder C(F)={x: B_r(x)≅F} is d‑open. Weighted local metrics d_w(x,y)=∑_{r≥0} w_r·1_{B_r(x)≄B_r(y)} (w_r↘0, ∑w_r<∞) are Polish, strongly local, and cylinder‑open.

Lemma A (robust nowhere‑denseness via cylinder forcing)
Let d be strongly local and cylinder‑open on X and S⊂X satisfy: for every cylinder C(F)≠∅ there exists a refined cylinder C(F′)⊆C(F) with C(F′)≠∅ and C(F′)⊆X\S. Then S is nowhere dense in (X,d).
Proof. As in earlier rounds: every nonempty d‑open U contains a cylinder C(F), which contains a smaller cylinder C(F′) disjoint from S; hence int_d(cl_d S)=∅.

Forcing in X=G_{•,≤D} (all D>2)
Lemma B (interior pendant‑path forcing). Fix D>2. Let C(F) be any cylinder in X=G_{•,≤D}, with F=B_r. Choose a boundary vertex u∈L_r(F) (existence trivial if F comes from an infinite graph). For an integer L≥2, form a refined ball F′ by adjoining a simple path P=u p_1 p_2 … p_L beyond u and then choosing r′=r+L+1. Finally, add one fresh leaf y attached to some vertex z at distance r′−1 to ensure L_{r′}(F′)≠∅ and has a vertex of degree <D. Then C(F′)⊆C(F) is nonempty and every extension of F′ contains the edge e=up_1 as a bridge.
Proof. In F′, every vertex of P has graph distance ≤r+L ≤ r′−1 from the root, so P⊂int(B_{r′}). In any extension of F′ within the cylinder, no vertex of P may gain new neighbors (else B_{r′} changes). Thus the only edge from P to V(F′)\P is e, whence e is a 1‑way infinite bridge in every completion. Nonemptiness holds because L_{r′}(F′) contains the added leaf y (degree 1<D), so an infinite ≤D extension can be constructed by attaching rooted (D−1)‑ary trees to boundary vertices with spare capacity and proceeding outward.
Corollary B1. For any strongly local, cylinder‑open metric d on X=G_{•,≤D} with D>2, “bridgeless” is nowhere dense.

Even‑regular parity and odd‑regular forcing in X=G_{•,=D}
Proposition C (even D parity). In any D‑regular graph with even D, a 1‑way infinite bridge is impossible: if S is the finite side of a cut, then D|S|=2|E(S)|+|∂S| forces |∂S| even.
Lemma D (sealed bubble for odd D). For odd D≥3 there exists a finite connected graph T with degree sequence (D−1,D,…,D). Given any cylinder C(F) with a boundary vertex u of residual capacity, adjoin T and a single edge e=ut_0 (t_0 has degree D−1 in T) and choose r′ so that T⊂int(B_{r′}). Then in X=G_{•,=D} (odd D) every extension has e as a 1‑way infinite bridge. A D‑regular infinite completion exists by Lemma E.
Sketch. Erdős–Gallai shows (D−1,D,…,D) is graphic for odd n≥D+2. Place T inside the interior of a large ball; then it is sealed topologically (no new edges may be added to T in any completion). The unique interface e is a bridge.
Lemma E (D‑regular completion outside a finite preball). Let H be finite with max degree ≤D (odd D). Attach to each vertex v with deficit c(v)=D−deg_H(v) a disjoint rooted infinite (D−1)‑ary tree T_{v,i} and connect root to v; then every vertex attains degree D and the resulting graph is infinite, connected, and D‑regular.

Two‑way infinite bridges are meagre (all D>2)
Lemma F (shielding). For k∈ℕ, let P_k be the set of graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge meeting B_k. For any cylinder C(F) with r≥k, classify edges e of F within distance ≤k as safe if in F−e some component has no boundary vertex, else critical. For each boundary vertex with spare capacity lying in a critical component, add one new neighbor outside B_r and connect all such new neighbors into a single simple cycle located at distances r+1 and r+2. Let F′ be the resulting (r+2)‑ball. Then no extension of F′ contains a 2‑way infinite bridge meeting B_k, so C(F′)⊆X\P_k. Thus P_k is nowhere dense. The union ⋃_k P_k is meagre. It is dense by adding far‑away double rays connected by a single edge within any cylinder.

Consequences for typicality under strongly local, cylinder‑open metrics
- X=G_{•,≤D}, D>2: By Lemma B and Lemma A, “bridgeless” is nowhere dense (hence meagre if (X,d) is Baire/Polish, which holds for d_w). This strengthens and corrects the forcing for even D by using interior pendant paths, not degree saturation.
- X=G_{•,=D}, odd D≥3: By Lemma D and Lemma A, “bridgeless” is nowhere dense (and meagre in Polish settings).
- X=G_{•,=D}, even D≥4: By Proposition C and Lemma F, “bridgeless” is comeagre (2‑way bridges meagre; 1‑way bridges impossible).

Examples and checks
- Nonempty interior of 1‑way‑at‑distance‑k (≤D). For any k and D≥2, pick r≫k and let F be a ball containing a pendant path Q of length >k fully inside (i.e., its far end sits at distance <r). Then C(F)⊂{graphs with a 1‑way bridge at distance ≤k}. Hence these sets have nonempty interior (they are not meagre), consistent with “bridgeless” being meagre (its complement is comeagre) for odd D and with “has a bridge” being dense for ≤D.

Obstacles and clarifications
- The earlier parity obstruction only blocks the degree‑saturation approach for even D; it does not apply to the interior pendant‑path forcing, which seals the finite side by topology (interiority of the ball), not by saturating degrees.
- The cylinder refinement must ensure nonemptiness; adding an extra leaf at distance r′ suffices to maintain a boundary vertex with degree <D, guaranteeing infinite completions.

Next steps
- Formalize Polishness for the listed metric family (d_w, FO‑local) and record the transfer of nowhere‑denseness via Lemma A.
- For =D odd, include a succinct construction of T (e.g., an appropriate subgraph of K_{D+2} with prescribed degrees) and a one‑page detailed proof of Lemma E.
- Investigate whether any genuinely nonlocal, Polish topology can flip typicality (make “bridgeless” comeagre) in ≤D for odd D without making “has a bridge” open; current evidence suggests strong locality is the robust regime where typicality is invariant.

Summary
- We corrected the ≤D forcing by using an interior pendant path, yielding a clean, rigorous proof: under any strongly local, cylinder‑open metric, bridgeless graphs are nowhere dense in G_{•,≤D} for all D>2. Together with the sealed‑bubble gadget for odd D in =D and parity plus shielding for even D in =D, this settles the typicality of “bridgeless” across a broad class of natural metrics: no natural strongly local alternative makes bridgeless typical in regimes where it is not under d_•.

Ideas
- Consolidate a rigorous “cylinder–rich forcing principle,” then give airtight gadgets for: (i) forcing a bridge in ≤D (all odd D and all D when we do not need parity‑violating cuts), (ii) forcing a bridge in =D for odd D with an explicit D‑regular completion, (iii) showing 2‑way bridges are meagre (and dense), hence even‑regular bridgeless is already comeagre under d_• and any equivalent strongly local metric.
- Add two key lemmas requested by the verifier: (A) a finite D‑regularization filler inside a ball, and (B) a D‑regular completion lemma for odd D.
- Prove an “impossibility of single‑edge sealed finite cuts” in ≤D for even D under cylinder constraints (parity obstruction), clarifying why our odd‑D sealed‑bubble works but any even‑D version yields an empty cylinder. This circumscribes what can be achieved by cylinder‑based metrics in ≤D with even D.

Cylinder‑rich forcing principle
Definition (cylinder‑rich). A topology τ on X=G_{\bullet,D} is cylinder‑rich if for every x∈X and every τ‑open U with x∈U there exists r with C(B_r(x))⊆U, where C(F):=G_\bullet^F.
Lemma CR. Let τ be cylinder‑rich on X and S⊆X. If for every cylinder C(F) there is a cylinder C(F′)⊆C(F) with C(F′)∩S=∅, then S is nowhere dense in (X,τ).
Proof. Given any nonempty τ‑open U, pick a cylinder C(F) with C(F)⊆U; by hypothesis pick C(F′)⊆C(F) disjoint from S; thus U contains a nonempty open subset disjoint from S. Hence int_τ(\overline S)=∅.

Natural metrics that are cylinder‑rich
Lemma 1 (weighted local metrics). For weights a_r>0 with \sum_r a_r<∞, define d_a((G,ρ),(H,σ)):=\sum_{r\ge0} a_r 1{B_r(G,ρ)\not\cong B_r(H,σ)}. Then the topology of d_a equals the Benjamini–Schramm topology and is cylinder‑rich.
Proof. If B_R match, then d_a≤\sum_{r>R}a_r, so C(B_R(x)) is open. Conversely, if B_R fail for all R≥R_0 then d_a≥\sum_{r\le R_0}a_r>0. Thus open sets are unions of cylinders.

Finite D‑regularization inside a ball
We isolate a reusable filler lemma.
Lemma 2 (finite D‑regularization filler). Fix D≥3. Let Q be a finite connected simple graph with Δ(Q)≤D, and let τ:V(Q)→{0,1,…,D} be target degrees with τ(v)≥deg_Q(v). Let S:=\sum_{v∈V(Q)}(τ(v)−deg_Q(v)). Then there exists a finite simple graph Q′ obtained from Q by adding finitely many new vertices U and edges among U and between U and V(Q) such that:
- deg_{Q′}(v)=τ(v) for all v∈V(Q);
- deg_{Q′}(u)≤D for all u∈U;
- Q′ is connected.
Proof. Let deficits δ(v):=τ(v)−deg_Q(v). Pick m large with m≥D+1 and mD≥S and mD≡S (mod 2). Create a set U of m new vertices, each with capacity D. Connect each of the S unit deficits to a distinct stub of U (injectively), thereby realizing δ(v) neighbors in U for each v and consuming S units of capacity at U. The remaining capacity R:=mD−S is even. Realize the remaining R stubs as a simple R/2‑edge graph on U (choose any D_0‑regular simple graph on U with D_0:=R/m≤D, e.g. by standard existence of regular graphs for m≥D+1 and parity condition). Ensure simplicity by choosing m large and avoiding repeated pairs (possible since initial Q–U edges used distinct U vertices). Finally, add a few extra edges within U (without exceeding degree D) to connect components if necessary. Thus Q′ is simple, connected, and satisfies degrees.
Remark. A variant yields τ(z)=D−1 for a designated z while τ(v)=D for v≠z, used below.

Odd‑regular bridge forcing and completion
Lemma 3 (odd‑regular bridge forcing in a cylinder). Let D=2t+1≥3. For any nonempty cylinder C(F) in G_{\bullet,=D}, there exists a cylinder C(F′)⊆C(F) such that every (G,ρ)∈C(F′) has a bridge.
Proof. Let r be the radius of F and choose b∈L_r(F) with deg_F(b)<D (needed for regular extensions). Enlarge the ball to radius r+R as follows. Introduce a path b–y–z, and next build a finite connected H with a distinguished vertex z_H satisfying deg_H(z_H)=D−1 and deg_H(v)=D for v∈V(H)\{z_H}. Identify z with z_H and ensure yz is present; now every vertex in H has degree D inside the ball. Saturate y to degree D within the ball via Lemma 2. No other edges are drawn between H∪{y} and the old part beyond the edge by. Let S:=V(H)∪{y}. In any D‑regular completion of C(F′), every vertex of S has degree D already inside the ball; hence no new edges can leave S. Therefore δ(S)={by} and by is a bridge in every completion.
Lemma 4 (odd D‑regular completion). The refined ball F′ from Lemma 3 admits a connected infinite D‑regular simple completion.
Proof. Let T be the infinite D‑regular tree. Choose a finite set W of pairwise distant vertices of T, and delete at most one incident edge at each to free one stub per chosen vertex. Pair the finitely many stubs arising from the boundary of F′ bijectively with W and add edges to connect. Use a few extra 2‑switches in T far from the attached points to restore degrees to D and to ensure the whole graph is connected and simple. Standard existence of D‑regular graphs on infinite trees and local edge‑switching provide the details.
Corollary 5. In any cylinder‑rich topology on G_{\bullet,=D} with odd D>2, the set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense.

Bridges in ≤D: odd D forcing and even D obstruction
Lemma 6 (sealed bubble forcing, ≤D, odd D). Let D≥3 be odd. For any nonempty cylinder C(F) in G_{\bullet,≤D}, there exists C(F′)⊆C(F) such that every (G,ρ)∈C(F′) has a bridge.
Proof. Use Lemma 2 with τ(v)=D for all new bubble vertices and τ(z)=D−1 for one designated z, attach the finite bubble S disjoint from B_r(F) via a single edge by to a chosen boundary vertex b, and otherwise saturate all vertices of S within the ball. In any completion, connectivity forces at least one new edge leaving S; capacity constraints force it to be incident with z and be unique; thus by is a bridge.
Proposition 7 (parity impossibility for even D in ≤D). Let D be even. There is no nonempty cylinder C(F′) in G_{\bullet,≤D} such that every completion of C(F′) contains a bridge e whose finite component lies entirely inside B_{r′}(F′).
Proof. Suppose C(F′) is nonempty and let S⊆B_{r′} be finite with δ(S)={e} in every completion. In any completion, all vertices of S must have no spare capacity to outside except possibly at the endpoints of e; but if any v∈S retained spare capacity, one could build a completion adding a second external edge to S while preserving the ball, contradicting |δ(S)|=1. Hence in every realization every vertex of S has final degree equal to its degree in the ball. Since D is even and deg(v)≤D for all v∈S, we can ensure (by adding inside‑ball filler, if needed) that all vertices of S have even final degree (common in sealed constructions). Then 2|E(S)|=\sum_{v∈S}\deg(v)−|δ(S)| is even minus |δ(S)|, forcing |δ(S)| even, a contradiction to |δ(S)|=1. Therefore any attempt to force a sealed one‑edge finite cut yields an empty cylinder. In particular, sealed‑bubble forcing cannot establish nowhere‑denseness of bridgeless in ≤D for even D via cylinders.
Remark. This does not rule out other mechanisms, but it shows the odd‑D argument cannot be transplanted.

Two‑way infinite bridges are meagre (but dense)
For k∈\mathbb N, let P_k be the set of rooted graphs that have a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance ≤k from the root.
Lemma 8 (cycle shielding; P_k nowhere dense). Fix D>2 and k. For any cylinder C(F) of radius r≥k, construct F′ by the following local refinement. Let E_k be the finite set of edges of F with midpoints within distance ≤k. For e∈E_k, if in F−e at least one side contains no vertex with residual capacity (<D), then in any completion that side remains finite and e cannot be 2‑way; ignore it. For the remaining e, pick vertices v_A,v_B on the two sides with residual capacity and add disjoint outside paths v_A–s_A^e–c_e–s_B^e–v_B at radius r+1 and r+2, thereby creating a cycle containing e entirely within B_{r+2}. This respects Δ≤D (and can be adapted to =D by saturating locally via Lemma 2). Then no e∈E_k can be a bridge in any completion of C(F′). Hence P_k is nowhere dense in G_{\bullet,D}.
Proposition 9 (2‑way bridges are meagre and dense). P:=\bigcup_k P_k is meagre (countable union of nowhere dense sets). P is dense: in any cylinder, add far away a double ray and link it to the core by a single edge without altering the inner ball, creating a 2‑way infinite bridge.
Corollary 10 (even‑regular comeagre bridgeless). In G_{\bullet,=D} with even D>2, every bridge is 2‑way infinite (finite‑side parity). Thus the bridged set equals P, meagre by Proposition 9. Therefore bridgeless is comeagre under d_• (and any topologically equivalent cylinder‑rich metric).

Consequences for the conjecture
- For odd D (≤D and =D): By Lemmas 3 and 6 with Lemma CR, bridgeless is nowhere dense under any cylinder‑rich (strongly local) metric. Weighted local metrics are cylinder‑rich (Lemma 1), hence typicality coincides with that under d_•.
- For even D in =D: Bridgeless is already comeagre (Corollary 10).
- For even D in ≤D: The sealed‑bubble mechanism cannot be used to force a 1‑edge finite cut (Proposition 7). Thus our current methods neither prove nor disprove nowhere‑denseness here; this is the remaining open regime for cylinder‑based topologies.

Examples
- D=3, =D: Take any 3‑regular finite R, delete one edge uv and add z adjacent to u,v so deg(z)=2, others 3. Attach as in Lemma 3; by is then a bridge in all completions. Apply Lemma 4 for an infinite 3‑regular completion.
- D=4, ≤D (odd‑style fails): Any attempt to seal a finite S to degree 4 and force a unique cross‑edge yields an empty cylinder by Proposition 7.

Next steps
- Formalize Lemma 2 fully (degree‑sequence feasibility and connectivity via standard regular graph existence and switchings). Package it for repeated use.
- Provide a completely explicit proof of Lemma 4 (detail the 2‑switching to avoid multiple edges and ensure connectivity while keeping degrees).
- Investigate ≤D with even D: either devise a different forcing (not relying on sealed finite sides) or prove an impossibility theorem that no cylinder refinement can force “has a bridge,” which would suggest that typicality might differ here across coarser/nonlocal topologies.
- If pursuing a metric change that flips typicality, move beyond cylinder‑rich: define an end‑aware inverse‑limit topology (basic clopens fixing an r‑ball plus counts of external rays per boundary vertex), prove it is metrizable and Baire, then attempt to show “no one‑edge finite cut” is comeagre there.

Summary
- Typicality is topological; weighted local and other strongly local metrics share the local topology and are cylinder‑rich, hence preserve typicality. We gave robust, local forcing of bridges in odd‑D regimes (≤D and =D) and meagreness of 2‑way bridges for all D>2, implying bridgeless is comeagre in even‑regular. We also proved an even‑D obstruction to sealed finite cuts in ≤D, clarifying limits of cylinder‑based forcing. The only plausible route to a metric changing bridge typicality appears to be via genuinely nonlocal, end‑sensitive topologies; their Baire/metrizability and bridge density remain to be established.

Assessing and repairing the current write‑up: bridges, topology, and forcing

Overview
- I identify specific flaws in Lemma 13 and the proofs of Theorems 14–17, provide corrected statements, and supply rigorous local (cylinder‑based) forcing arguments. I also separate the odd/even D‑regular cases and clarify what can be transported to alternative metrics/topologies.

1) Foundational topology: cylinders and closure
- Cylinders are clopen in the local topology. If F is a realized r‑ball, G_•^F = {(G,ρ): B_r(G,ρ) ≅ F} is open by definition and closed because if x_n ∈ G_•^F and x_n → x in d_•, then B_r(x) ≅ F (for s ≤ r we eventually have B_s(x_n) ≅ B_s(x)). This should be recorded explicitly.
- Correct nowhere‑dense criterion. A set S is nowhere dense iff for every realized cylinder G_•^F there exists a realized cylinder G_•^{F′} ⊆ G_•^F with G_•^{F′} ∩ cl(S) = ∅. In our applications we construct G_•^{F′} ⊆ X \ S (stronger). The third bullet of Lemma 13 must be amended accordingly (it currently omits the closure).
- Nonemptiness of cylinders in G_{•,≤D}. If F is a realized r‑ball in G_{•,≤D}, then some boundary vertex v ∈ L_r(F) must satisfy deg_F(v) < D (otherwise the graph cannot be infinite). Conversely, any such F extends to an infinite ≤ D graph by attaching a tree outside. This sharpens the second bullet of Lemma 13.

2) Forcing a bridge in ≤ D: fix to Theorem 14(i)
Issue. “Attach a leaf to a boundary vertex” (as sketched) does not force a bridge: completions could add edges at that new vertex unless it lies strictly inside the cylinder’s fixed ball.

Lemma (finite pendant subtree forcing in ≤ D, all D ≥ 2). Let X = G_{•,≤D}. For any realized cylinder G_•^F (radius r ≥ 1), there exists R > r and a realized cylinder G_•^{F′} ⊆ G_•^F such that every (G,ρ) ∈ G_•^{F′} has a (1‑way infinite) bridge.
Proof. Choose a boundary vertex u ∈ L_r(F) with deg_F(u) < D. Outside B_r, build a finite pendant subtree T of size ≥ 2, attached to u by a single edge e, and place the entirety of T strictly inside B_R for some R > r (ensure every vertex of T lies at distance < R). Ensure also that at least one vertex of L_R(F′) retains residual degree < D (so infinite completions exist). Let F′ = B_R of this extension. In any completion with B_R fixed, no vertex of T can gain new edges (that would alter B_R), and T meets the rest of G only at u. Hence e is a bridge in every completion in G_•^{F′}. QED.
Consequences. This yields Theorem 14(i) for all D ≥ 2 in ≤ D: in every cylinder we find a subcylinder where every member has a bridge; hence the set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense. This is simpler and corrects the invalid boundary‑leaf argument.

3) Forcing a bridge in = D (odd D): correct gadget and proof of Theorem 14(ii)
Parity barrier (even D). In D‑regular graphs with even D, 1‑way infinite bridges cannot occur: if removing e leaves a finite component A, then ∑_{v∈A} deg_G(v) = D|A| − 1 (odd), contradicting that this sum equals 2|E(A)|.

Odd D saturated bubble. For odd D ≥ 3, we can force a bridge by sealing a finite side entirely within a ball:
- Construct H: Let m = D + 2 (odd). Take K_m, delete the edges of a Hamiltonian cycle C_m so every vertex now has degree D − 1, then add a maximum matching M leaving a prescribed vertex w unmatched (such a matching exists since m is odd). The resulting simple connected H has deg(w) = D − 1 and all other vertices degree D.
- Placement: Outside B_r(F), insert H completely within a larger ball B_R, disjoint from B_r, and add a single edge e = uw to a chosen boundary vertex u ∈ L_r(F). After adding e, every vertex of H has degree D already within B_R, so in any completion preserving B_R no new edges can attach to H; thus e is the unique cut‑edge between H and the rest, hence a bridge in every completion within the cylinder G_•^{F′}, F′ = B_R. Ensure nonemptiness by leaving residual capacity at some boundary vertex of L_R.
This rigorously establishes Theorem 14(ii) for odd D.

4) Two‑way infinite bridges are dense meagre (complete proof of Theorem 16)
Setup. Fix D > 2 and X ∈ {G_{•,≤D}, G_{•,=D}}. For k ∈ N, let P_k be the set of graphs having a 2‑way infinite bridge e with both endpoints in B_k.
- Nowhere dense at fixed k. Given G_•^{F} (radius r ≥ k), let E_k be edges of F with both endpoints in B_k. Call e ∈ E_k critical if F − e has both sides containing at least one boundary vertex in L_r(F) with residual degree (< D); otherwise e is safe. Safe e can never be a 2‑way infinite bridge in any completion of F (one side cannot become infinite). For the finitely many critical e, select a set S ⊆ L_r(F) containing one residual boundary vertex from each side of each critical e. Outside B_r attach, for each v ∈ S, a new vertex x_v adjacent to v, and connect the x_v in a single simple cycle C lying outside B_r. Let F′ = B_{r+2} of this extension. Then for each critical e = ab there are paths in F − e from a to some v_A ∈ S and from b to some v_B ∈ S on opposite sides; with C these yield a cycle through e entirely within B_{r+2}. Hence G_•^{F′} ⊆ G_•^{F} \ P_k. Nonemptiness is maintained by reserving at least one boundary stub (≤ D) or filling later (= D, see completion below). Thus P_k is nowhere dense.
- Meagreness. P = ⋃_k P_k is meagre.
- Density. For any cylinder G_•^{F} (radius r), extend outside B_r by attaching two disjoint infinite D‑bounded trees (≤ D) or D‑regular trees (= D after regular completion) and connect them by a single edge e far beyond radius r. Then e is a 2‑way infinite bridge; by choosing attachments beyond some R ≫ r we ensure B_r remains unchanged. Hence P is dense.
Conclusion. The set of graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge is dense meagre in both ≤ D and = D (D > 2).
Corollary (even D regular). In G_{•,=D} with even D, every bridge is 2‑way infinite (parity), so “has a bridge” is meagre; thus bridgeless graphs are comeagre in the local topology.

5) D‑regular completion lemma (to ensure nonempty cylinders in the = D constructions)
Lemma (D‑regular completion outside a finite ball). Let D ≥ 2. Suppose F′ is a finite rooted graph intended as a ball B_R with all vertices inside at distance < R having degree exactly D in F′, and boundary vertices v ∈ L_R(F′) having deg_{F′}(v) ≤ D. Then one can extend F′ to a connected infinite D‑regular simple graph G with B_R(G,ρ) ≅ F′.
Sketch proof. Let S be the multiset of boundary “stubs” consisting of D − deg_{F′}(v) copies of each v ∈ L_R(F′). Choose a connected infinite D‑regular simple graph H_out disjoint from F′ (e.g., a D‑regular Cayley graph). Partition S into pairs (if |S| is odd, enlarge R by one to adjust parity; for odd D this can always be arranged by a one‑layer buffer). For each pair {v_1, v_2}, pick two vertex‑disjoint edges y_1z_1, y_2z_2 in H_out with all endpoints distinct and far from each other and from previous choices. Replace these two edges by a 2‑switch: delete y_1z_1 and y_2z_2; add edges v_1y_1, v_2z_2, and z_1y_2. This keeps all degrees in H_out at D, increases deg(v_i) by 1 for i = 1,2, and introduces no edges inside B_R. Iterate over all pairs. The result is a connected infinite D‑regular simple graph extending F′ with the prescribed ball B_R. QED.
Remarks. The parity/two‑stub pairing is the only subtlety; it is harmless since we control R when forming F′ in our forcing steps (odd D: choose R so |S| is even; even D: our use is limited to the 2‑way bridge density proof and cut‑vertex forcing below, where pairing can be arranged similarly).

6) Theorem 15 (no cut vertex nowhere dense): details
- The sealed‑bubble idea adapts to articulation points in both ≤ D and = D. Inside a refined ball B_R, prepare two finite connected “blobs” H_1, H_2, each placed entirely within B_R, disjoint except for a single articulation vertex v, and ensure: (i) all vertices of each H_i other than v have degree D within B_R (in = D exact; in ≤ D at most D), (ii) no edges between H_1 \ {v} and H_2 \ {v} within B_R, and (iii) some boundary vertex in L_R has residual capacity to guarantee completions. In any completion preserving B_R, no edges can be added between the blobs (that would alter B_R), so v remains a cut vertex in every completion inside the cylinder G_•^{B_R}. Thus “no cut vertex” is nowhere dense.

7) Theorem 17 (edge‑chromatic number): current proof invalid
- The step “removing an edge preserves χ′ = D + 1 by parity” is false (e.g., K_3). To prove nowhere denseness of “χ′ = D” one needs a finite class‑II forcer H_D with χ′(H_D) = D + 1 such that any supergraph containing H_D as an induced subgraph satisfies χ′ ≥ D + 1, plus an embedding lemma respecting degree budgets in the cylinder. Candidates: overfull subgraphs (even D) and odd‑order D‑regular graphs (odd D), but one must show induced containment and degree‑saturation block any D‑edge‑coloring extension. Absent this, Theorem 17 should be marked open or reworked with a precise forcer and embedding.

8) Metric/topology sensitivity: what survives alternative metrics
- Typicality is purely topological. Equivalent metrics preserve it. Beyond that, one cannot rely on monotonicity under refinements/coarsenings. To legitimately transfer the cylinder‑forcing arguments to another metric/topology τ, require a strong locality property: for every τ‑open neighborhood U of x there exists an r with the local cylinder C(B_r(x)) ⊆ U. Call τ cylinder‑dominating. Then any property whose complement can be forced on subcylinders (as above) remains nowhere dense in τ: given nonempty U, pick a cylinder C ⊆ U and refine to C′ disjoint from the target set. This covers many “natural” local metrics (weighted sums of r‑ball tests, FO‑local metrics) provided they are Polish/Baire. In such topologies, bridgeless remains nowhere dense in ≤ D and in = D with odd D; for even D regular, bridgeless is already comeagre under the local topology.
- Nonlocal metrics/topologies (recording, e.g., global end structure or a “has a bridge” bit) can alter openness but must be shown metrizable and Baire before making typicality claims. The write‑up should either propose a concrete nonlocal Baire topology or restrict claims to cylinder‑dominating families.

9) Examples and quick checks
- ≤ D, even D: The pendant subtree forcing inside the ball works and avoids parity issues; it shows bridgeless is nowhere dense (Theorem 14(i)) without degree saturation.
- = D, even D: Parity forbids 1‑way bridges; with the dense‑meagre result for 2‑way bridges, bridgeless is comeagre.
- = D, odd D: The K_{D+2} − C + M bubble forcing works; a short cubic (D=3) instance can be written explicitly.

10) Obstacles and next steps
- Formalize the D‑regular completion lemma with explicit pairing and 2‑switches; add a brief parity note on arranging |S| even by adjusting R for odd D.
- Amend Lemma 13 (closure) and state the clopen cylinder fact explicitly.
- Replace Theorem 14 proofs with: (i) pendant subtree forcing for ≤ D; (ii) saturated bubble for odd D in = D; (iii) parity corollary (even D regular) yielding bridgeless comeagre.
- Provide full details for Theorem 16 as written above, including the = D case using the completion lemma.
- For Theorem 15 include the explicit articulation forcing with degree saturation inside the ball.
- Either supply a valid finite class‑II forcer and embedding for Theorem 17 or mark as open.
- If pursuing alternative metrics, fix a class (e.g., cylinder‑dominating) and prove it is Polish/Baire and that the forcing arguments carry over verbatim.

Concise corrected picture
- ≤ D (all D ≥ 2): Bridgeless is nowhere dense via pendant subtree forcing inside the cylinder.
- = D, odd D: Bridgeless is nowhere dense via saturated bubble forcing (explicit H from K_{D+2} − C + M) plus completion lemma.
- = D, even D: Bridgeless is comeagre (2‑way bridges are dense meagre; 1‑way bridges impossible by parity).
- Theorem 17 requires a new forcer; current parity argument is invalid.
- Under any cylinder‑dominating alternative metric/topology, these typicality conclusions persist; genuine changes require nonlocal topologies whose Baire properties and densities must be established first.

### Typical properties of countable graphs: flows and bridges  
*(Extended abstract)*  

**Robert Šámal**\* · **Hadi Zamani**\*

#### Abstract
We have two aims. **First**, we study nowhere‑zero flows in countably infinite graphs, observing the different roles of two types of bridges. **Second**, we study how typical graphs with these types of bridges are. As there is no natural probability measure to use, we turn to an analytic approach: we study which sets are nowhere dense and which are meagre.

In finite graphs, bridges play a crucial role—it is easy to see that every flow assigns value \(0\) to every bridge. It is also known that graphs with a bridge are not typical: both dense random graphs and random regular graphs are bridgeless w.h.p. [3, 1]. We ask how this transfers to countable graphs. In Section 1 we explain differences between bridges and flows and, via compactness, we prove a version of Seymour’s 6‑flow theorem for countable graphs.

In Section 2 we explore nowhere‑dense and meagre sets. This is called for because the usual probabilistic models collapse: extending Erdős–Rényi to countably infinite graphs yields the Rado graph a.s., so we are effectively studying a single graph up to isomorphism. Attempting random regular graphs via the configuration model [1] would require a uniform distribution on perfect matchings of a countable set (e.g., neighbors of the first vertex), which does not exist. Consequently, we turn to Baire category: meagre/co‑meagre sets (also “first/second category”).

### 1. Nowhere‑zero flows for infinite graphs

**Definition 1 (weak flow).**  
Given an orientation \(D\) of a graph \(G\) and an abelian group \(A\), a **weak \(A\)‑flow** is a function \(\varphi:E(G)\to A\) such that **Kirchhoff’s law for each vertex cut** holds:
\[
\forall v\in V(G):\quad \sum_{e\in \delta^-(v)}\varphi(e)=\sum_{e\in \delta^+(v)}\varphi(e).
\]

**Definition 2 (strong flow).**  
Given \(D,G,A\) as above, a **strong \(A\)‑flow** is a function \(\varphi:E(G)\to A\) such that **Kirchhoff’s law for each cut** holds:
\[
\forall S\subseteq V(G):\quad \sum_{e\in \delta^+(S)}\varphi(e)=\sum_{e\in \delta^-(S)}\varphi(e).
\]

In either case, \(\varphi\) is a **nowhere‑zero** weak/strong \(A\)‑flow if \(\varphi^{-1}(0)=\varnothing\).

**Definition 3 (bridge).**  
An edge \(e\) of \(G\) is a **bridge** if deleting \(e\) increases the number of connected components. A bridge is **2‑way infinite** if both resulting components are infinite, and **1‑way infinite** otherwise.

Every strong flow is a weak flow. While the two notions are equivalent on finite graphs, they diverge on infinite graphs: e.g., on a two‑way infinite path, a nowhere‑zero weak \(A\)‑flow exists but a strong one does not. In [6] the authors construct a 3‑connected graph with two ends that admits a nowhere‑zero weak \(A\)‑flow but no nowhere‑zero strong \(A\)‑flow. Nearly all finite flow theorems extend to infinite **strong** \(A\)‑flows via topological compactness; here we use **logical** compactness to obtain:

**Theorem 4.**  
*A countably infinite, locally finite graph without a 1‑way infinite bridge has a nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow.*

### 2. Metric space of rooted connected graphs

Since no good probability measure exists for countable graphs, we study typicality via a metric topology and Baire category.

**Definition 5 (ε‑neighborhood).**  
For a metric space \((X,d)\) and \(x\in X\), the ε‑neighborhood is \(U_\varepsilon(x)=\{y\in X:\ d(x,y)<\varepsilon\}\). The closed neighborhood \(\overline{U}_\varepsilon(x)\) uses \(d(x,y)\le \varepsilon\).

**Definition 6 (open set).**  
A set \(U\subseteq X\) is open if \(\forall x\in U\ \exists \varepsilon>0:\ U_\varepsilon(x)\subseteq U\).

We now fix the graph space and metric.

**Definition 9 (space of rooted graphs).**  
Let \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) be the set of all connected rooted graphs (up to root‑preserving isomorphism). For \(D>2\), let \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) be those with all degrees \(\le D\), and \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) those with all degrees \(=D\).

**Definition 10 (r‑ball).**  
For \((G,v)\), the rooted r‑ball is
\[
B_r(G,v)=(\,G[\{y\in V(G): d(v,y)\le r\}],\,v\,).
\]

**Definition 11 (metric \(d_\bullet\)).**  
For \((G_1,v_1),(G_2,v_2)\in\mathbf{G}_\bullet\),
\[
d_\bullet\big((G_1,v_1),(G_2,v_2)\big)=\inf\{2^{-r} : B_r(G_1,v_1)\cong B_r(G_2,v_2)\}.
\]
This is a metric [5].

**Definition 12 (extensions of an r‑ball).**  
For an r‑ball \(F=B_r(G,v)\), define
\[
\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F=\{(G',v')\in \mathbf{G}_\bullet : B_r(G',v')\cong F\}.
\]

**Lemma 13 (basic facts in \((\mathbf{G}_\bullet,d_\bullet)\)).**  
- For each \((G,x)\), \(r\in\mathbb{N}\), and \(0<\varepsilon<1\):
  \[
  U_{2^{-r}+\varepsilon}((G,x))=U_{2^{-r}}((G,x))=\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{B_r(G,x)}.
  \]
- \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F\) is nonempty if \(F\) is an r‑ball in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) that contains a vertex of degree \< \(D\) at distance \(r\) from the root.
- A subset \(S\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) is nowhere dense iff
  \(\forall\) r‑balls \(F\ \exists\) r′‑ball \(F'\) with \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F'}\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F}\setminus S\).
- For all \(D>2\), \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) is not meagre.

### Main results on typical properties

**Theorem 14.**  
*The set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense (i) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) for all \(D>2\); and (ii) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) for all odd \(D>2\).*  
In D‑regular graphs with even \(D\), 1‑way infinite bridges cannot exist; instead we obtain:

**Theorem 15.**  
*The set of graphs without a cut vertex is nowhere dense in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

**Theorem 16.**  
*The set of graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge is meagre (but not nowhere dense) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

We also considered other (a)typical properties:

**Theorem 17.**  
*The set of graphs with edge‑chromatic number \(D\) is nowhere dense in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

### 3. Proof sketches

**Proof of Theorem 4 (sketch).**  
Let the vertices of \(G\) be \(v_1,v_2,\ldots\) and orient each edge \(\{v_i,v_j\}\) from the smaller to the larger index. For each radius \(r\), augment the r‑ball \(B_r(G,v_1)\) to a finite multigraph \(G_r\) by adding a sink vertex \(v_\infty\) and connecting boundary edges to \(v_\infty\). Introduce Boolean variables \(F_{e,1},\dots,F_{e,6}\) encoding which of six nonzero values an edge \(e\) receives, enforce exclusivity \(\bigvee_i F_{e,i}\) and \(\bigwedge_{j\ne i}\neg F_{e,j}\), and write linear parity constraints at each vertex (Kirchhoff’s law). Let \(F_{G_r}\) be the conjunction over vertices of \(G_r\); then every finite subset of the constraint family \(\{F_{G_r}\}_r\cup\{F_{e,i}\}_e\) is satisfiable (by [7]), hence by compactness [4] the whole set is satisfiable, yielding a nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow on \(G\).

**Proof idea for Theorem 14.**  
Given an r‑ball \(F\), construct an r′‑ball \(F'\) such that every extension of \(F'\) contains a bridge. For \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\), attach a leaf to a boundary vertex of degree \<\(D\). For \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) handle regularity via parity gadgets: define \(S(F)=\sum_{v\in L_r}(D-\deg v)\) where \(L_r\) is the boundary; use \(K_{D+1}-e\) gadgets and tree‑like expansions to force parity \(S(F)=1\), then attach a new vertex to create a bridge. Hence the bridgeless set is nowhere dense.

**Proof idea for Theorem 15.**  
In even \(D\)‑regular graphs, use gadgets to force a cut vertex; in odd \(D\) or degree‑bounded spaces, this also follows from the previous construction.

**Proof idea for Theorem 16.**  
Being “there is a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance \(k\)” is nowhere dense; take a union over \(k\in\mathbb{N}\) to get a meagre (but not nowhere‑dense) set.

**Proof idea for Theorem 17.**  
For each \(D\), there exist \(D\)‑regular graphs with \(\chi'(G)=D+1\) (even \(D\): complete graphs or any odd‑order \(D\)‑regular graph; odd \(D\): by Tutte’s theorem). Removing an edge preserves \(\chi'=D+1\) by parity. Embed parity gadgets within r‑balls so that every extension has edge‑chromatic number \(D+1\), hence the set is nowhere dense.

### 4. Future work (the conjectures)

**Question 18.** *Is the fact that a property is nowhere dense or meagre independent of the root?*  
A change of root gives one type of change of metric; however, many metrics on the space of countable graphs are possible.

**Question 19.** *Is there another metric on \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) where typical properties are different?*  
For instance, is there a metric in which **bridgeless graphs are typical**?

We also aim to investigate additional (a)typical properties in the spirit of Theorem 17.
