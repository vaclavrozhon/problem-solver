Then there exists R>r and a realized cylinder C(F\u2032)\u2286C(F) such that every (G,\u03c1)\u2208C(F\u2032) contains a bridge.\\nProof. Since C(F) is realized by infinite graphs with \u0394\u2264D and preserves B_r, some boundary vertex u\u2208L_r(F) has deg_F(u)<D. Choose L\u22652.

To ensure nonemptiness of C(F\u2032), add a fresh leaf y attached to some vertex z at distance R\u22121 (for instance z=p_L), so y lies on L_R(F\u2032) with degree 1< D.

In any completion (G,\u03c1) with B_R(G,\u03c1)\u2245F\u2032, no vertex of P can gain new neighbors (else B_R would change), and within B_R the only edge between V(P) and V(B_R)\\\\V(P) is e=up_1.

Then each P_k is nowhere dense in G_{\u2022,D}, and P:=\u22c3_{k}P_k is meagre and dense.\\nProof. Fix k and a realized cylinder C(F) with radius r\u2265k. Let E_k be the finite set of edges of F whose distance to the root is \u2264k. Call e\u2208E_k safe if, in F\u2212e, at least one component contains no boundary vertex v\u2208L_r(F) with deg_F(v)<D; otherwise e is critical. A safe e cannot be a 2\u2011way infinite bridge in any completion of C(F), because one side has no capacity to become infinite while preserving B_r. For the critical edges, choose a finite set S\u2286L_r(F) that contains at least one boundary vertex (with spare capacity) from each side of every critical e. Refine F by, for each v\u2208S, adding one new neighbor x_v at distance r+1, and connecting the set {x_v:v\u2208S} into a single simple cycle using fresh vertices at distance r+2. Let F\u2032:=B_{r+2} of this extension. Then for each critical e=ab there are paths in F\u2212e from a to some v_A\u2208S and from b to some v_B\u2208S on opposite sides; the external cycle yields a v_A\u2013v_B path outside B_r, so e lies on a cycle contained in B_{r+2}(F\u2032). Therefore no e\u2208E_k is a bridge in any completion with B_{r+2} fixed, and C(F\u2032)\u2286C(F)\u2216P_k. Nonemptiness is maintained by reserving at least one fresh boundary stub (e.g., keep one new cycle vertex of degree 2) to allow infinite continuation beyond radius r+2. Thus P_k is nowhere dense. Hence P is meagre. For density, given any cylinder C(F) (radius r), extend far outside B_r by attaching two disjoint infinite \u0394\u2264D trees (or D\u2011regular trees in the =D case after local completion) and connect them by a single edge e; connect the core to exactly one of the trees by a long path. This keeps B_r unchanged and makes e a 2\u2011way infinite bridge, proving density.\u220e\\n\\nCorollary (Even D\u2011regular comeagre bridgeless).\\nIn G_{\u2022,=D} with even D, every bridge is 2\u2011way infinite.
