Fixed forcing: For ≤D all D≥2, force a bridge by placing a finite pendant subtree entirely inside a larger ball; the attachment edge is then a bridge in all completions. For =D odd, use sealed bubbles and provide a D‑regular completion lemma. Parity blocks sealed one‑edge cuts for even D but does not affect the interior pendant‑subtree forcing for ≤D. Proved “2‑way bridges” are dense meagre via an external cycle. Under strongly local metrics, typicality matches the local topology: bridgeless nowhere dense in ≤D (all D) and =D (odd), comeagre in =D (even).
