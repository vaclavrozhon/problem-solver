{"feedback_md":"Main findings and fixes this round:\n- For ≤D, the correct forcing is to place a finite pendant subtree entirely inside a larger ball, so the attachment edge lies strictly in the interior. Then every completion that preserves the ball cannot add edges to the interior vertices, and the attachment edge is a bridge in all such completions. This works for all D≥2 and avoids parity issues. Ensure to pick a boundary vertex with spare capacity (deg< D) when attaching the subtree; realized cylinders have at least one such vertex. This corrects the invalid “attach a leaf on the boundary” argument.\n- For =D, odd D: keep the sealed‑bubble gadget (finite connected H with degree sequence (D−1,D,…,D), attach by a single edge and seal inside the ball). Provide an explicit EG‑based construction and a clean D‑regular completion lemma (attach (D−1)-ary trees outside and patch by 2‑switches) to guarantee nonempty cylinders.\n- Even D: sealed finite one‑edge cuts are impossible by parity; any construction that ends with all bubble vertices degree D and |∂S|=1 yields an empty cylinder. Prover 2’s “one spare stub” forcing contradicts parity; it must be retracted. However, the interior pendant‑subtree forcing for ≤D does not require sealing to degree D and remains valid for even D.\n- Two‑way infinite bridges: Use a single external cycle attached to finitely many boundary vertices with spare capacity to put all “critical” inner edges within distance ≤k on cycles. This shows for each k that the property “2‑way bridge meets B_k” is nowhere dense; the union is meagre and dense. With parity, bridgeless is comeagre in =D with even D under any strongly local/cylinder‑open metric.\n- Metric class: Strongly local/cylinder‑open (weighted local, FO‑local) metrics are Polish and support the cylinder forcing: bridgeless is nowhere dense in ≤D (all D≥2) and in =D (odd D); bridgeless is comeagre in =D (even D).\n\nNext steps:\n- Write the interior pendant‑subtree forcing lemma cleanly (choose u with spare capacity; place the pendant path strictly inside the ball; ensure nonempty boundary at the new radius).\n- Finalize an explicit D‑regular completion lemma (odd D) with a short 2‑switching argument guaranteeing simplicity/connectivity.\n- Keep the meagreness proof for 2‑way bridges with the single external cycle; add the =D adaptation via local fillers.\n- Catalogue strongly local metrics formally (weighted local, FO‑local) and record Polishness and invariance.

Then there exists R>r and a realized cylinder C(F′)⊆C(F) such that every (G,ρ)∈C(F′) contains a bridge.\nProof. Since C(F) is realized by infinite graphs with Δ≤D and preserves B_r, some boundary vertex u∈L_r(F) has deg_F(u)<D. Choose L≥2. Form F′ by adjoining a simple path P=u p_1 p_2 … p_L outside B_r and choosing R:=r+L+1 so that every vertex of P lies at distance ≤R−1 from the root (hence P⊂int(B_R)). To ensure nonemptiness of C(F′), add a fresh leaf y attached to some vertex z at distance R−1 (for instance z=p_L), so y lies on L_R(F′) with degree 1< D. Then C(F′)⊆C(F) and is nonempty. In any completion (G,ρ) with B_R(G,ρ)≅F′, no vertex of P can gain new neighbors (else B_R would change), and within B_R the only edge between V(P) and V(B_R)\\V(P) is e=up_1. Hence removing e disconnects G, i.e., e is a (1‑way infinite) bridge.∎\n\nLemma (Two‑way bridges are meagre and dense in G_{•,D} for D>2).\nFor k∈N, let P_k be the set of rooted graphs having a 2‑way infinite bridge meeting B_k. Then each P_k is nowhere dense in G_{•,D}, and P:=⋃_{k}P_k is meagre and dense.\nProof. Fix k and a realized cylinder C(F) with radius r≥k. Let E_k be the finite set of edges of F whose distance to the root is ≤k. Call e∈E_k safe if, in F−e, at least one component contains no boundary vertex v∈L_r(F) with deg_F(v)<D; otherwise e is critical. A safe e cannot be a 2‑way infinite bridge in any completion of C(F), because one side has no capacity to become infinite while preserving B_r. For the critical edges, choose a finite set S⊆L_r(F) that contains at least one boundary vertex (with spare capacity) from each side of every critical e. Refine F by, for each v∈S, adding one new neighbor x_v at distance r+1, and connecting the set {x_v:v∈S} into a single simple cycle using fresh vertices at distance r+2. Let F′:=B_{r+2} of this extension. Then for each critical e=ab there are paths in F−e from a to some v_A∈S and from b to some v_B∈S on opposite sides; the external cycle yields a v_A–v_B path outside B_r, so e lies on a cycle contained in B_{r+2}(F′). Therefore no e∈E_k is a bridge in any completion with B_{r+2} fixed, and C(F′)⊆C(F)∖P_k. Nonemptiness is maintained by reserving at least one fresh boundary stub (e.g., keep one new cycle vertex of degree 2) to allow infinite continuation beyond radius r+2. Thus P_k is nowhere dense. Hence P is meagre. For density, given any cylinder C(F) (radius r), extend far outside B_r by attaching two disjoint infinite Δ≤D trees (or D‑regular trees in the =D case after local completion) and connect them by a single edge e; connect the core to exactly one of the trees by a long path. This keeps B_r unchanged and makes e a 2‑way infinite bridge, proving density.∎\n\nCorollary (Even D‑regular comeagre bridgeless).\nIn G_{•,=D} with even D, every bridge is 2‑way infinite. By the lemma, graphs with a 2‑way bridge form a meagre set; hence bridgeless graphs are comeagre.\n"},"output_update":null}
