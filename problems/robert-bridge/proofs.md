# Rigorous Proofs



Definitions. A subset S of G_{\bullet,D} is saturated if for every (G,\rho) in S and every vertex u of G, (G,u) is also in S.

Lemma 1 (closure and interior of saturated sets are saturated). Let S be saturated. Then cl(S) and Int(cl(S)) are saturated.
Proof. We first show cl(S) is saturated. Fix (G,\rho) in cl(S) and u in V(G). For each integer t≥0, choose r≥t+dist_G(\rho,u). By (G,\rho) in cl(S), there exists (H_r,\sigma_r) in S and a root‑preserving isomorphism \phi_r: B_r(G,\rho)→B_r(H_r,\sigma_r). Let u_r=\phi_r(u). Since S is saturated and (H_r,\sigma_r) in S, also (H_r,u_r) in S. Moreover, B_t(G,u)≅B_t(H_r,u_r) because t≤r−dist(\rho,u). Hence for every t there is an element of S whose t‑ball at the root matches B_t(G,u); thus (G,u) in cl(S). Therefore cl(S) is saturated.
For the interior, note that Int(cl(S)) is a union of open sets contained in cl(S), and re‑rooting preserves membership in cl(S) by the first part. Hence Int(cl(S)) is saturated. ∎

Theorem 2 (root‑invariance of nowhere density). Let P be any property of unrooted graphs and S_P={ (G,\rho) in G_{\bullet,D} : G has P }. Then S_P is nowhere dense in (G_{\bullet,D},d_\bullet) if and only if Int(cl(S_P))=\emptyset, and this condition is independent of the choice of root. In particular, whether S_P is nowhere dense does not depend on the root.
Proof. S_P is saturated. By Lemma 1, cl(S_P) and Int(cl(S_P)) are saturated. Since “nowhere dense” means Int(cl(S_P))=\emptyset, the statement is root‑invariant. ∎

Definitions. A subset S of G_{\bullet,D} is saturated if (G,\rho) in S implies (G,u) in S for all vertices u of G. For an r-ball F, the cylinder C(F):=G_{\bullet}^{F}={ (H,\sigma): B_r(H,\sigma)≅F }.

Lemma 1 (cylinders are clopen). For every finite rooted ball F, the cylinder C(F) is open and closed in (G_{\bullet,D},d_\bullet).
Proof. Openness: If (H,\sigma)\in C(F) with F an r-ball, then for any ε with 0<ε≤2^{-(r+1)} the ε-ball around (H,\sigma) equals C(F). Closedness: If (H,\sigma)\notin C(F), then B_r(H,\sigma) is some r-ball F'\not\cong F; hence (H,\sigma) lies in the open cylinder C(F'), and the complement of C(F) is the union of such cylinders. ∎

Lemma 2 (closure of saturated sets is saturated). If S⊆G_{\bullet,D} is saturated, then cl(S) is saturated.
Proof. Fix (G,\rho)\in cl(S) and u\in V(G). For t≥0, choose r≥t+dist_G(\rho,u). There exists (H_r,\sigma_r)\in S with B_r(H_r,\sigma_r)≅B_r(G,\rho). Transport u to u_r via this isomorphism. By saturation, (H_r,u_r)\in S, and B_t(H_r,u_r)≅B_t(G,u). Thus every neighborhood of (G,u) meets S, so (G,u)\in cl(S). ∎

Proposition 3 (root-free cylinder criterion for nowhere density). Let P be a property of unrooted graphs and S_P={ (G,\rho): G has P }. The following are equivalent:
(a) S_P is nowhere dense in G_{\bullet,D}.
(b) For every rooted r-ball F there exists an extension r′-ball F′ with C(F′)⊆C(F) and such that for every D-bounded connected graph H and vertex v with B_{r′}(H,v)≅F′, the unrooted graph H does not have P.
Proof. (a⇒b) Since cylinders form a clopen base (Lemma 1), nowhere denseness yields for each F a subcylinder C(F′)⊆C(F) disjoint from S_P. Any (H,v) with B_{r′}(H,v)≅F′ then lies outside S_P, hence H fails P. (b⇒a) If (b) holds, then each cylinder C(F) contains a subcylinder C(F′) disjoint from S_P, which is equivalent to S_P being nowhere dense. ∎

Theorem 4 (Root-invariance of nowhere density). Fix D≥2. For any unrooted property P, the set S_P={ (G,\rho) in G_{\bullet,D} : G has P } is nowhere dense in (G_{\bullet,D},d_\bullet) if and only if the root-free condition (b) in Proposition 3 holds. In particular, the nowhere-dense status of S_P is independent of root choices.
Proof. Immediate from Proposition 3. ∎

Lemma A (Δ=D ball completion). Let D≥3 and let F be a finite rooted graph of radius R with root ρ. Assume (i) every vertex v with dist_F(ρ,v)<R has deg_F(v)=D; and (ii) at least one vertex x in the outer layer L_R has deg_F(x)<D. Then there exists a countably infinite connected D-regular graph G with B_R(G,ρ)≅F.
Proof. For each x∈L_R, let q(x)=D−deg_F(x)≥0 and s=∑_{x∈L_R}q(x)≥1. Build an external reservoir as follows. Take a single infinite D-regular tree T, and delete a countable family M={e_i=u_i v_i : i∈ℕ} of pairwise edge-disjoint edges. In the resulting graph T−M, the set U={u_i,v_i : i∈ℕ} consists of vertices of degree D−1; all other vertices retain degree D. Choose distinct w_1,…,w_s∈U, and partition {w_1,…,w_s} into subsets of sizes {q(x)} indexed by x∈L_R. Form G_0 by taking the disjoint union of F and T−M and, for each x∈L_R, adding edges from x to its assigned q(x) vertices in U. Now every x∈L_R attains degree D; each chosen w_j∈U attains degree D. The remaining vertices in U (still countably many) have degree D−1. Enumerate the connected components of T−M and select one remaining degree-(D−1) vertex from each component; pair these selected vertices along a bi-infinite chain by adding edges between consecutive ones, and pair all other remaining degree-(D−1) vertices arbitrarily in disjoint edges. This yields a graph O in which all vertices have degree D and O is connected. Let G be the union of F and O with the attachment edges added above. Then G is connected and D-regular. Since all new neighbors of vertices at distance <R lie outside L_R, B_R(G,ρ)=F. ∎

Proposition B (k-local bridges are nowhere dense for D≥3). Fix D≥3 and k∈ℕ. Let Br_≤k be the set of rooted graphs (G,ρ) in G_{•,≤D} or G_{•,=D} that have a bridge at distance ≤k from ρ. Then Br_≤k is nowhere dense.
Proof. Let C(F_0) be a nonempty cylinder of radius r. Choose R≫r+k. Extend F_0 to a layered finite ball F_1 of radius R by adding new layers r+1,…,R so that: (a) all vertices at distance <R have degree ≤D and, in the Δ=D case, exactly D; (b) every vertex in the outer layer L_R has degree 1 (only the back-edge to L_{R−1}). Let E_k be the finite set of edges e of F_1 whose endpoints lie at distance ≤k from ρ.
For each e=ab∈E_k, choose two internally vertex-disjoint a→L_R and b→L_R paths in F_1 that avoid e (possible since between r and R we can allocate disjoint forward branches; choose R large enough to separate these finitely many requirements). Let their endpoints in L_R be denoted b_e^+ and b_e^−, with all these endpoints distinct across different e. Outside L_R, build a finite merger tree S whose leaves are in bijection with the set B={b_e^+,b_e^−: e∈E_k}, and join each such leaf to its corresponding boundary vertex in L_R. Let F′ be the resulting finite ball of radius R′>R (add only edges and vertices beyond L_R). In the Δ= D case, all vertices at distance <R already have degree D; in the Δ≤D case, all degrees remain ≤D; S can be chosen with maximum degree 3≤D. By construction, for any completion H of F′ (Δ≤D or, using Lemma A, Δ=D) and any e∈E_k, there is an H-path from b_e^+ to b_e^− that avoids e, so e lies on a cycle. Thus no edge within distance ≤k of ρ is a bridge in any completion of F′, i.e., C(F′)⊆C(F_0)\Br_≤k. Therefore Br_≤k is nowhere dense. ∎

Corollary C (2-way infinite bridges are meagre but not nowhere dense for D≥3). Let S_{2w} be the set of rootings whose underlying graph has a 2-way infinite bridge. Then S_{2w} is meagre and dense in G_{•,≤D} and in G_{•,=D} for D≥3.
Proof. Write S_{2w}=⋃_{k≥0} Br_≤k; by Proposition B each Br_≤k is nowhere dense, hence S_{2w} is meagre. For density, given any cylinder C(F_0), extend beyond a large radius to obtain an infinite completion A; attach an additional infinite tree T disjoint from A and join A to T by a single edge e whose endpoints lie outside the prescribed ball. Then e is a 2-way infinite bridge in the resulting completion, which lies in C(F_0). This works under Δ≤D; for Δ=D, first ensure (by extending the ball) two designated boundary vertices have spare degree and attach the two infinite D-regular trees at those vertices before adding e; Lemma A provides D-regular completions. Hence S_{2w} is dense. ∎
