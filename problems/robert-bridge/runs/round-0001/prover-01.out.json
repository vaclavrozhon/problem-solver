  "content": "Ideas and scope\n- The conjecture as written (\u201cthe smallness of SP does not depend on the choice of the root \u03c1\u201d) is ambiguous: SP itself is already root-invariant (membership depends only on G). What can vary is the topology: rooted vs unrooted, or the metric induced by rerooting. Below I: (i) propose a precise framework comparing rooted and unrooted spaces via the forgetful map; (ii) prove root-invariance for nowhere denseness; (iii) prove root-invariance for meagreness under a mild definability (Baire property) assumption; and (iv) point out gaps and places in the current writeup where rigor and clarity can be improved.\n\nSet-up: rooted vs unrooted topologies and the forgetting map\n- Rooted space R = G_{\u2022,D}: connected, countably infinite rooted graphs with \u0394\u2264D, metric d_\u2022 by matching r-balls around the designated root.\n- Unrooted space U = G_{\u2218,D}: connected, countably infinite unrooted graphs with \u0394\u2264D, endowed with the \u201cunrooted local metric\u201d d_\u2218 defined by\n  d_\u2218(G,H) = 2^{-R}, R = sup{ r : \u2203x\u2208V(G), y\u2208V(H) with B_r(G,x) \u2245 B_r(H,y) }.\n  Equivalently, d_\u2218(G,H)<2^{-r} iff some rooted r-balls in G and H match.\n- Forgetting map \u03c0: R \u2192 U, \u03c0(G,\u03c1)=G.\n\nBasic topological facts (to be stated and proved explicitly)\n- Cylinder sets are clopen in R: for any r-ball F, G^{F}_\u2022 := { (G,\u03c1) : B_r(G,\u03c1) \u2245 F } is clopen. Hence the characterization of nowhere dense sets in Lemma 13 (third bullet) can use cylinders (this should be stated precisely as \u201cfor all cylinders C there is a subcylinder C\u2032\u2286C disjoint from S\u201d).\n- U is Polish (indeed compact) with the metric d_\u2218; \u03c0 is a continuous, open, surjective quotient map. A base for U is given by the sets \u03c0(G^{F}_\u2022), i.e., \u201cgraphs having some root with r-ball F.\u201d\n  Sketch: Continuity of \u03c0 is immediate; opennness follows because \u03c0 sends basic cylinders in R to basic opens in U defined by the corresponding unrooted r-ball types. Compactness of both R and U follows by standard diagonal arguments (Benjamini\u2013Schramm compactness). Please include a short proof or references.\n\nMain root-invariance statements\nLet P\u2286U be any property of unrooted graphs; write T_P = P\u2286U and S_P = \u03c0^{-1}(P)\u2286R. Then S_P is saturated (closed under rerooting within each graph).\n\nTheorem A (nowhere denseness is root-invariant). S_P is nowhere dense in R if and only if T_P is nowhere dense in U.\nProof.\n(\u21d2) Suppose S_P is nowhere dense in R. Let O\u2286U be nonempty open. Since sets of the form \u03c0(G^{F}_\u2022) form a base, it suffices to consider O = \u03c0(G^{F}_\u2022). By nowhere denseness of S_P, there is a subcylinder G^{F\u2032}_\u2022\u2286G^{F}_\u2022 with G^{F\u2032}_\u2022\u2229S_P=\u2205. Then W:=\u03c0(G^{F\u2032}_\u2022) is open, W\u2286O, and W\u2229T_P=\u2205: indeed, if G\u2208W then some rooting (G,\u03c1)\u2208G^{F\u2032}_\u2022, but S_P=\u03c0^{-1}(T_P) and G^{F\u2032}_\u2022\u2229S_P=\u2205 force G\u2209T_P. Thus T_P is nowhere dense in U.\n(\u21d0) Suppose T_P is nowhere dense in U. Let C be a nonempty open cylinder in R; then \u03c0(C) is open in U. There is open W\u2286\u03c0(C) with W\u2229T_P=\u2205. Hence \u03c0^{-1}(W) is open, \u03c0^{-1}(W)\u2286C, and \u03c0^{-1}(W)\u2229S_P=\u2205. Thus S_P is nowhere dense in R.\n\nTheorem B (meagreness is root-invariant for sets with the Baire property). If T_P has the Baire property in U, then S_P is meagre in R if and only if T_P is meagre in U.\nProof.\n(\u21d2) Assume S_P is meagre but T_P is not meagre. Since T_P has the Baire property, there is nonempty open O\u2286U such that T_P is comeagre in O. Because \u03c0 is open and surjective, \u03c0^{-1}(O) is nonempty open in R and \u03c0^{-1}(T_P\u2229O)=S_P\u2229\u03c0^{-1}(O) is comeagre in \u03c0^{-1}(O) (preimages of dense open sets under open surjections are dense open). This contradicts meagreness of S_P.\n(\u21d0) If T_P is meagre, write T_P=\u22c3_n N_n with each N_n nowhere dense; by Theorem A, \u03c0^{-1}(N_n) is nowhere dense in R. Hence S_P=\u03c0^{-1}(T_P)=\u22c3_n \u03c0^{-1}(N_n) is meagre.\nRemark. Without the Baire-property hypothesis, the (\u21d2) direction can fail in general topological spaces (non-Baire measurable subsets). In our context, most natural P (Borel/analytic) have the Baire property, so the theorem applies as stated.\n\nConsequences for the paper\u2019s Conjecture\n- As a precise formulation, I recommend: \u201cLet P be any (Borel) property of unrooted graphs in U. Then the set S_P of all rooted graphs whose underlying unrooted graph has P is nowhere dense in R if and only if T_P is nowhere dense in U; and meagre in R if and only if meagre in U.\u201d This captures \u2018root-invariance of smallness\u2019 rigorously.\n- If you prefer to keep the rooted space as the ambient one, Theorem A already settles the \u2018nowhere dense\u2019 part unconditionally; for \u2018meagre\u2019 add \u201cassuming the Baire property.\u201d\n\nTargeted critique and fixes in the current writeup\n1) Definition of the metric (Def. 11). You write an \u201cinf\u201d definition; the standard is d_\u2022((G,v),(H,w))=2^{-R} with R the sup of matching radii. Both are equivalent here, but it helps to mention that the metric is an ultrametric and to note explicitly that the basic cylinders are clopen (useful in Lemma 13 and later arguments).\n\n2) Lemma 13 (nonemptiness of cylinders). The statement \u201cG_\u2022^F is nonempty if F is an r-ball in G_{\u2022,\u2264D} that contains a vertex of degree <D at distance r from the root\u201d is plausible, but please add a short constructive proof: extend F by attaching infinite D-regular trees (or appropriate \u2264D trees) at boundary vertices with spare degree to achieve an infinite connected extension with \u0394\u2264D. This is used many times later.\n\n3) Characterization of nowhere dense (Lemma 13, third bullet). Since cylinders are clopen, your criterion is correct; please state it explicitly as: \u201cS\u2286R is nowhere dense iff for every r-ball F there exists r\u2032 and F\u2032 with G_\u2022^{F\u2032}\u2286G_\u2022^F\\S.\u201d Adding a one-line proof would aid readers unfamiliar with ultrametric cylinder algebras.\n\n4) Theorem 14(ii), odd D regular case. The parity gadget sketch is too vague. You need a concrete finite r\u2032-ball F\u2032 that forces every D-regular extension to have a 1-edge cut. Parity alone yields that every finite cut has size \u2261|S|\u00b7D (mod 2), but forcing \u201csize 1\u201d requires a specific finite construction blocking all but one external stub. A rigorous approach:\n   - Define a \u2018port\u2019 vertex x on the boundary with exactly one free stub and saturate all other boundary vertices to degree D within F\u2032. Ensure that any edge leaving the component must go through x. Argue that in any D-regular completion the unique edge crossing \u03b4(V(F\u2032)) is a bridge and its removal leaves the inside finite, outside infinite (1-way infinite bridge).\n   - Care is needed in \u0394=D: saturating boundary degrees and keeping \u0394\u2264D must still allow a completion; include a brief inductive extension argument.\nProvide a full finite gadget or a reference; at present the step \u201cattach a new vertex to create a bridge\u201d contradicts \u0394=D and needs correction.\n\n5) Theorem 15 (cut vertices in even D). Similarly, \u201cuse gadgets to force a cut vertex\u201d needs a concrete finite pattern ensuring that any completion creates a cut vertex (for even D, 1-way infinite bridges are impossible). Please supply the gadget and the parity/degree bookkeeping.\n\n6) Theorem 16 (2-way infinite bridges are meagre but not nowhere dense). This can be made precise now:\n   - For k\u2208N, let B_k be the set of (G,\u03c1) with a 2-way infinite bridge whose midpoint lies at distance \u2264k from \u03c1. For any cylinder C, refine to a subcylinder C\u2032 where all edges within distance \u2264k lie on cycles (attach small cycles locally to each such edge) so that no such edge can be a bridge in any extension. Hence each B_k is nowhere dense. The set of graphs with a 2-way infinite bridge is \u22c3_k B_k and so is meagre.\n   - It is not nowhere dense because it is dense: given any cylinder, take a completion and, far outside the prescribed ball, splice in two disjoint infinite components and connect them by a single edge; this completion has a 2-way infinite bridge. Thus the closure is all of R.\nAdd these details; the current text only sketches the first part and does not justify density.\n\n7) Theorem 17 (edge-chromatic number D is nowhere dense). The sketch should be supplemented with:\n   - For each D>2, fix a finite \u0394\u2264D graph H with \u03c7\u2032(H)=D+1 (e.g., for even D use K_{D+1}; for odd D\u22653 use a known class-2 D-regular graph, e.g., the Petersen graph for D=3 and standard constructions for general odd D by Vizing/Tutte-type existence results\u2014please cite a specific reference and construction).\n   - Build an r\u2032-ball F\u2032 that contains H as a subgraph and saturates all boundary degrees to \u2264D so that any completion of F\u2032 still contains H as a subgraph; hence every completion has \u03c7\u2032\u2265D+1. Conclude that the set {\u03c7\u2032=D} is nowhere dense.\n\n8) Theorem 4 (weak 6-flows). The logical compactness step is fine in outline. For rigor, specify the finite satisfiability more explicitly: show that each augmented finite multigraph G_r admits a nowhere-zero Z_6-flow (by Seymour\u2019s theorem) and that the imposed orientation and sink wiring preserve feasibility; then invoke compactness with a precise reference (e.g., the compactness theorem for propositional logic or ultraproducts) and a sentence on how the local solutions cohere.\n\n9) Minor points.\n   - The \u201cD>2\u201d restriction in Lemma 13 (last bullet) about nonmeagreness of the whole space: the Baire property holds (indeed compactness) also for D=2; you can drop \u201c>2\u201d here.\n   - Terminology: specify \u201cclosed r-ball\u201d (you do) and emphasize that all graphs are simple (or allow multiedges where used\u2014Theorem 4 uses multigraphs in the argument).\n\nObstacles and caveats\n- Meagreness without the Baire property: If you intend Conjecture 18 to hold for arbitrary subsets P\u2286U (no definability), the (\u21d2) direction in Theorem B can fail in general topological settings. Restricting to Borel (or at least sets with the Baire property) makes the equivalence correct and usable in combinatorial contexts.\n- Global rerooting as a homeomorphism R\u2192R is impossible without extra structure (no canonical choice of the new root). The quotient framework via \u03c0 is the right formalization.\n\nNext steps\n1) Insert Theorems A and B (with proofs) as a dedicated section addressing the root-invariance question precisely.\n2) Flesh out gadget constructions for Theorems 14 and 15 with complete degree/parity bookkeeping and an explicit extension lemma guaranteeing nonemptiness of the corresponding cylinders in \u0394\u2264D and \u0394=D settings.\n3) Add the full proof of Theorem 16 along the two-step plan above (nowhere dense decomposition, plus density).\n4) Provide precise references for the existence of class-2 D-regular graphs for all odd D and include the explicit small examples for D=3,5 as sanity checks.\n5) Consider adding a short appendix stating the standard topological facts used (compactness of R and U, cylinders are clopen, \u03c0 is open/quotient) with proofs or citations, so later arguments can invoke them without ambiguity.\n\nSummary claim to extract\n- Nowhere denseness is root-invariant unconditionally (Theorem A). Meagreness is root-invariant for all natural (Borel/analytic) properties (Theorem B). This clarifies and, in a strong sense, resolves your Conjecture 18 for the intended class of properties, and it organizes the paper\u2019s later arguments around the robust rooted/unrooted quotient framework."
