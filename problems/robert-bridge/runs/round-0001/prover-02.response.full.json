A set S\u2282G_{\u2022,D} is saturated if it is a union of E\u221e-classes, i.e., membership depends only on the underlying unrooted graph.\\n- For a property P of unrooted graphs, S_P:=\u03c0^{-1}(P) is saturated. The conjecture is then: the smallness (nowhere dense/meagre) of saturated sets S_P is independent of the choice of the root (i.e., depends only on P).\\n- For nowhere density, the cylinder characterization via r-balls immediately yields a root-free criterion. For meagreness, the direct union-of-nowhere-dense reduction is more delicate because \u201csaturating\u201d a nowhere dense set need not be nowhere dense in general. We isolate what we can prove rigorously now and what remains.\\n\\nBasic facts we use\\n- Cylinders are clopen: for an r-ball F, G_{\u2022}^{F}={x: B_r(x)\u2245F} equals an open ball of radius 2^{-r} and is closed as well (ultrametric).  \\n- Nowhere-dense criterion (already recorded as Lemma 13): S is nowhere dense iff \u2200 r-ball F \u2203 extension r\u2032-ball F\u2032 with G_{\u2022}^{F\u2032}\u2282G_{\u2022}^{F}\u2216S.\\n\\nResult 1 \u2014 Nowhere\u2011dense part of the conjecture holds\\nProposition. Let P be any property of unrooted graphs and S_P=\u03c0^{-1}(P)\u2282G_{\u2022,D}. Then S_P is nowhere dense iff the following root\u2011free statement holds: for every rooted r\u2011ball F there exists an extension F\u2032 such that every D\u2011bounded connected graph G that admits some vertex v with B_{r\u2032}(G,v)\u2245F\u2032 fails P. In particular, the nowhere\u2011dense status of S_P depends only on P (and D) and not on the choice of the root.\\n\\nProof. (\u201c\u21d0\u201d) If the displayed root\u2011free statement holds then G_{\u2022}^{F\u2032}\u2282G_{\u2022}^{F}\u2216S_P because any (G,\u03c1) extending F\u2032 satisfies G\u2209P. By the nowhere\u2011dense criterion, S_P is nowhere dense.  \\n(\u201c\u21d2\u201d) If S_P is nowhere dense, then for every F there is F\u2032 with G_{\u2022}^{F\u2032}\u2282G_{\u2022}^{F}\u2216S_P. For any (G,\u03c1)\u2208G_{\u2022}^{F\u2032} we have (G,\u03c1)\u2209S_P, hence G\u2209P. Thus every graph extending F\u2032 fails P, establishing the root\u2011free statement. \u220e\\n\\nConsequences and checks\\n- All nowhere\u2011dense results in the current notes (e.g., \u201chas no cut vertex\u201d, \u201cbridgeless\u201d, \u201c\u03c7\u2032=D\u201d in the stated regimes) are immediately root\u2011invariant by the proposition.  \\n- The proof exhibits a practical recipe for certifying nowhere density of S_P: given F, find F\u2032 that locally forbids P in the sense that it forbids it for the whole unrooted extension, not just at the centre. This is exactly how the parity/leaf gadgets in the notes were used.\\n\\nMeagre part \u2014 what we can say now, and obstacles\\n- In our space (compact, zero\u2011dimensional), meagre means countable union of nowhere dense. For S_P saturated, meagreness trivially \u201cdoes not depend on choosing a root\u201d in the naive sense that S_P itself does not change when vertices are re\u2011chosen as roots (S_P is E\u221e\u2011invariant). The nontrivial question is whether there is a root\u2011free certification analogous to the nowhere\u2011dense case: i.e., a characterization of meagreness of S_P that quantifies only over root\u2011free extension\u2011forbidden patterns.\\n- A direct reduction \u201cS_P meagre \u21d4 S_P=\u22c3_n N_n with each N_n root\u2011free nowhere dense\u201d is false in general since saturating an arbitrary nowhere dense set N (replacing N by \u03c0^{-1}(\u03c0(N))) need not preserve nowhere density (E\u221e\u2011classes are not closed, and the nowhere\u2011dense cylinder\u2011witness F\u2032 for N need not forbid the underlying P globally once roots are allowed to move).\\n- Nevertheless, for specific P used in the notes (e.g., \u201chas a 2\u2011way infinite bridge\u201d), the existing proofs already produce root\u2011free witnesses: \u201cthere is a 2\u2011way infinite bridge at distance k\u201d is nowhere dense uniformly in k, and S_P is a countable union over k of such root\u2011free cylinder obstructions. Hence the meagreness established there is root\u2011invariant.\\n\\nExamples (sanity checks)\\n- P = \u201ccontains a bridge\u201d. The standard construction yields, for each r\u2011ball F, an extension F\u2032 such that every extension graph has a bridge (unrooted). Hence S_P is nowhere dense, root\u2011invariant by the proposition.  \\n- P = \u201ccontains a 2\u2011way infinite bridge\u201d. The set is meagre and not nowhere dense (as in the notes). The proof decomposes S_P as \u22c3_{k\u22650} S_{P,k} where S_{P,k} says \u201cthere is a 2\u2011way infinite bridge meeting B_k at a prescribed spot\u201d. Each S_{P,k} is nowhere dense by a root\u2011free obstruction, hence the meagreness is root\u2011invariant.\\n\\nObstacles to a full meagre\u2011level theorem\\n- The main technical hurdle is that the category proof via the Banach\u2013Mazur/Choquet game gives a winning strategy for avoiding S_P by choosing deeper cylinders, but the strategy\u2019s moves need not be \u201croot\u2011free\u201d (i.e., need not produce F\u2032 whose every unrooted extension fails P). Turning an arbitrary winning strategy into a root\u2011free one would settle the full conjecture for meagre sets; we currently do not know how to do this in general.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Prove a \u201croot\u2011free determinacy\u201d lemma: If II has a winning strategy (S_P meagre), then II has a positional strategy that at each stage picks an F\u2032 forbidding P globally among all extensions. This looks plausible in our ultrametric space, where one can always refine by one layer.  \\n- Alternatively, search for a counterexample P where every cylinder refinement that avoids S_P at the centre still allows P elsewhere in some extension, yet S_P is meagre. Such a P would disprove the meagre part of the conjecture. A promising direction is to encode global parity constraints that are only locally avoidable at a designated vertex.\\n\\nSummary\\n- We proved the conjecture for nowhere density: for any unrooted property P, the nowhere\u2011dense status of S_P depends only on P (and D), not on roots.  \\n- For meagreness, the conjecture holds for the concrete properties treated in the notes (e.g., 2\u2011way infinite bridges) via explicit root\u2011free decompositions. The general case reduces to extracting root\u2011free winning strategies in the Banach\u2013Mazur game; this remains open here. We outlined why the naive saturation\u2011of\u2011nowhere\u2011dense approach fails and proposed concrete next steps to resolve the general case.\"}",
