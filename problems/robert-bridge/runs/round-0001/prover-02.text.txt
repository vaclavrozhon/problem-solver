Ideas
- Formalize root changes via the equivalence relation E∞: (G,ρ) E∞ (G,σ) iff ρ,σ∈V(G). A set S⊂G_{•,D} is saturated if it is a union of E∞-classes, i.e., membership depends only on the underlying unrooted graph.
- For a property P of unrooted graphs, S_P:=π^{-1}(P) is saturated. The conjecture is then: the smallness (nowhere dense/meagre) of saturated sets S_P is independent of the choice of the root (i.e., depends only on P).
- For nowhere density, the cylinder characterization via r-balls immediately yields a root-free criterion. For meagreness, the direct union-of-nowhere-dense reduction is more delicate because “saturating” a nowhere dense set need not be nowhere dense in general. We isolate what we can prove rigorously now and what remains.

Basic facts we use
- Cylinders are clopen: for an r-ball F, G_{•}^{F}={x: B_r(x)≅F} equals an open ball of radius 2^{-r} and is closed as well (ultrametric).  
- Nowhere-dense criterion (already recorded as Lemma 13): S is nowhere dense iff ∀ r-ball F ∃ extension r′-ball F′ with G_{•}^{F′}⊂G_{•}^{F}∖S.

Result 1 — Nowhere‑dense part of the conjecture holds
Proposition. Let P be any property of unrooted graphs and S_P=π^{-1}(P)⊂G_{•,D}. Then S_P is nowhere dense iff the following root‑free statement holds: for every rooted r‑ball F there exists an extension F′ such that every D‑bounded connected graph G that admits some vertex v with B_{r′}(G,v)≅F′ fails P. In particular, the nowhere‑dense status of S_P depends only on P (and D) and not on the choice of the root.

Proof. (“⇐”) If the displayed root‑free statement holds then G_{•}^{F′}⊂G_{•}^{F}∖S_P because any (G,ρ) extending F′ satisfies G∉P. By the nowhere‑dense criterion, S_P is nowhere dense.  
(“⇒”) If S_P is nowhere dense, then for every F there is F′ with G_{•}^{F′}⊂G_{•}^{F}∖S_P. For any (G,ρ)∈G_{•}^{F′} we have (G,ρ)∉S_P, hence G∉P. Thus every graph extending F′ fails P, establishing the root‑free statement. ∎

Consequences and checks
- All nowhere‑dense results in the current notes (e.g., “has no cut vertex”, “bridgeless”, “χ′=D” in the stated regimes) are immediately root‑invariant by the proposition.  
- The proof exhibits a practical recipe for certifying nowhere density of S_P: given F, find F′ that locally forbids P in the sense that it forbids it for the whole unrooted extension, not just at the centre. This is exactly how the parity/leaf gadgets in the notes were used.

Meagre part — what we can say now, and obstacles
- In our space (compact, zero‑dimensional), meagre means countable union of nowhere dense. For S_P saturated, meagreness trivially “does not depend on choosing a root” in the naive sense that S_P itself does not change when vertices are re‑chosen as roots (S_P is E∞‑invariant). The nontrivial question is whether there is a root‑free certification analogous to the nowhere‑dense case: i.e., a characterization of meagreness of S_P that quantifies only over root‑free extension‑forbidden patterns.
- A direct reduction “S_P meagre ⇔ S_P=⋃_n N_n with each N_n root‑free nowhere dense” is false in general since saturating an arbitrary nowhere dense set N (replacing N by π^{-1}(π(N))) need not preserve nowhere density (E∞‑classes are not closed, and the nowhere‑dense cylinder‑witness F′ for N need not forbid the underlying P globally once roots are allowed to move).
- Nevertheless, for specific P used in the notes (e.g., “has a 2‑way infinite bridge”), the existing proofs already produce root‑free witnesses: “there is a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance k” is nowhere dense uniformly in k, and S_P is a countable union over k of such root‑free cylinder obstructions. Hence the meagreness established there is root‑invariant.

Examples (sanity checks)
- P = “contains a bridge”. The standard construction yields, for each r‑ball F, an extension F′ such that every extension graph has a bridge (unrooted). Hence S_P is nowhere dense, root‑invariant by the proposition.  
- P = “contains a 2‑way infinite bridge”. The set is meagre and not nowhere dense (as in the notes). The proof decomposes S_P as ⋃_{k≥0} S_{P,k} where S_{P,k} says “there is a 2‑way infinite bridge meeting B_k at a prescribed spot”. Each S_{P,k} is nowhere dense by a root‑free obstruction, hence the meagreness is root‑invariant.

Obstacles to a full meagre‑level theorem
- The main technical hurdle is that the category proof via the Banach–Mazur/Choquet game gives a winning strategy for avoiding S_P by choosing deeper cylinders, but the strategy’s moves need not be “root‑free” (i.e., need not produce F′ whose every unrooted extension fails P). Turning an arbitrary winning strategy into a root‑free one would settle the full conjecture for meagre sets; we currently do not know how to do this in general.

Next steps
- Prove a “root‑free determinacy” lemma: If II has a winning strategy (S_P meagre), then II has a positional strategy that at each stage picks an F′ forbidding P globally among all extensions. This looks plausible in our ultrametric space, where one can always refine by one layer.  
- Alternatively, search for a counterexample P where every cylinder refinement that avoids S_P at the centre still allows P elsewhere in some extension, yet S_P is meagre. Such a P would disprove the meagre part of the conjecture. A promising direction is to encode global parity constraints that are only locally avoidable at a designated vertex.

Summary
- We proved the conjecture for nowhere density: for any unrooted property P, the nowhere‑dense status of S_P depends only on P (and D), not on roots.  
- For meagreness, the conjecture holds for the concrete properties treated in the notes (e.g., 2‑way infinite bridges) via explicit root‑free decompositions. The general case reduces to extracting root‑free winning strategies in the Banach–Mazur game; this remains open here. We outlined why the naive saturation‑of‑nowhere‑dense approach fails and proposed concrete next steps to resolve the general case.
