For an unrooted property P, the set S_P=\\\\{(G,\\\\rho): G\\\\text{ has }P\\\\} is saturated under re-rooting (it is a union of entire unrooted isomorphism classes). We aim to show: (i) the nowhere-dense status of S_P is independent of the root in a strong, intrinsic sense; (ii) provide a robust route toward the meagre case and prove it for a broad class of P, together with a structural \u201cre-rooting on a basic open set\u201d lemma that should let the verifier turn this into a full proof.\\n\\nPreliminaries and basic topology\\n- Let X=\\\\mathbf{G}_{\\\\bullet,D} with the Benjamini\u2013Schramm metric d_\\\\bullet. Basic open sets are \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^F for finite rooted balls F. If \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^F\\\\neq\\\\varnothing, then at least one boundary vertex of F has degree <D (standard).\\n- For A\\\\subseteq X, \\\\overline{A}=\\\\{x\\\\in X:\\\\ \\\\forall r\\\\ \\\\exists y\\\\in A\\\\text{ with }B_r(y)\\\\cong B_r(x)\\\\}. Thus A is nowhere dense iff for every r-ball F there exists an r\u2032-ball F\u2032 with \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^{F\u2032}\\\\subseteq\\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^{F}\\\\setminus\\\\overline{A}.\\n- If S\\\\subseteq X is saturated (closed under changing the root within the underlying graph), then so are \\\\overline{S} and \\\\operatorname{Int}(\\\\overline{S}).\\n\\nLemma 1 (robust characterization of nowhere density for saturated sets)\\nLet S\\\\subseteq X be saturated. Then S is nowhere dense in X iff\\n\u2200 rooted r-balls F with \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^F\\\\neq\\\\varnothing \u2203 a rooted r\u2032-ball F\u2032 extending F with \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^{F\u2032}\\\\cap S=\\\\varnothing.\\nProof. \u201c\u21d2\u201d: If S is nowhere dense, then for each nonempty basic open U=\\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^F there is a nonempty open V\\\\subseteq U disjoint from \\\\overline{S}; replace V by a basic \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^{F\u2032}. \u201c\u21d0\u201d: If the displayed condition holds then, by definition of the basis, no \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^F can be contained in \\\\overline{S}, so \\\\operatorname{Int}(\\\\overline{S})=\\\\varnothing.\\n\\nProposition 2 (root-invariance for nowhere density)\\nFor any unrooted property P and S_P as above, whether S_P is nowhere dense in X does not depend on the root.\\nProof. The criterion in Lemma 1 depends only on which finite rooted balls can or cannot be extended to an element of S_P. If a rooted ball F appears around some vertex of a P-graph, then every re-rooting of F (at a vertex within distance \u2264r) appears around some vertex of the same P-graph\u2014so the collection of rooted balls \u201cadmissible for P\u201d is closed under re-rooting of the ball itself. The condition \u201cfor every F there is an extension F\u2032 avoiding S_P\u201d quantifies over all rooted balls; re-indexing this family by re-rooting is a mere permutation of the index set and does not change the truth value. Hence nowhere-dense status is root-invariant.\\n\\nA local re-rooting homeomorphism on a basic open set\\nWe record a tool that will be useful for meagreness.\\n\\nLemma 3 (marker-based re-rooting on a subbasic open set)\\nFix a rooted r-ball F and a vertex u of F. There exists an extension F_\\\\mathrm{mark} (a rooted r\u2032-ball with r\u2032\u2265r) such that:\\n- \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^{F_\\\\mathrm{mark}}\\\\neq\\\\varnothing;\\n- within the r\u2032-ball, there is a unique \u201ccoded beacon\u201d placed on some boundary vertex lying on a fixed geodesic from the root to u, so that u is uniquely identifiable from the root by a finite syntactic rule (follow the unique beaconed geodesic back toward the root by a prescribed number of steps);\\n- the map \\\\varphi: \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^{F_\\\\mathrm{mark}}\\\\to \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^{F_\\\\mathrm{mark}[u]} sending (G,\\\\rho) to (G,u) (i.e., re-rooting at the identified copy of u) is a homeomorphism between these two basic open sets.\\nSketch of construction. Choose a geodesic path from the root to u inside F, then extend the ball far enough so that the path continues to the boundary. At the boundary endpoint b of that path, \u201chang\u201d a small rigid gadget (e.g., a finite tree with a degree sequence pattern that does not appear elsewhere inside the ball); do this without violating the degree bound\u2014possible because \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^F\\\\neq\\\\varnothing ensures some boundary degrees are free, and going one step farther if needed ensures we can place the beacon on a boundary vertex along the designated path. The uniqueness of the gadget within the r\u2032-ball makes the geodesic to b unique; the location of u is now a fixed offset along that geodesic, so re-rooting is well-defined and depends only on the r\u2032-ball. The induced map is continuous, with continuous inverse (apply the same procedure in reverse), hence a homeomorphism. Details are routine once a concrete rigid gadget is fixed; the only nontrivial point is guaranteeing free degree at the chosen boundary vertex, which follows from nonemptiness of \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^F and, if necessary, one-step further extension.\\n\\nConsequences for meagreness (partial results)\\n- Homeomorphisms preserve meagreness and nowhere density. Lemma 3 provides a large family of local homeomorphisms that implement re-rooting on basic open subsets whose definitions depend only on finite data.\\n- Suppose S\\\\subseteq X is saturated. If S is nonmeagre in some basic open \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^F, we may refine to a subbasic open \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^{F_\\\\mathrm{mark}} where the re-rooting homeomorphism \\\\varphi of Lemma 3 is defined. Then S is nonmeagre in \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^{F_\\\\mathrm{mark}} iff it is nonmeagre in \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^{F_\\\\mathrm{mark}[u]}. Since S is saturated, \\\\varphi(S\\\\cap \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^{F_\\\\mathrm{mark}})=S\\\\cap \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^{F_\\\\mathrm{mark}[u]}. This shows that any local witness of nonmeagreness is stable under re-rooting.\\n- Iterating this for finitely many steps allows moving the root to any prescribed vertex within a fixed finite radius, on a possibly smaller basic open subset. Thus the presence/absence of local comeagreness cannot depend on which radius-\u2264R vertex plays the role of the root, whenever we restrict to a suitable subbasic open neighborhood.\\n\\nProposition 4 (meagreness is root-invariant for local-existential P)\\nAssume P is \u201clocal existential\u201d: there exist r and a finite pattern H (with \u0394(H)\u2264D) such that G has P iff G contains a copy of H. Then S_P is an \\\\mathcal{F}_\\\\sigma subset of X (S_P=\\\\bigcup_{k\\\\ge 0}A_k where A_k says \u201ca copy of H appears at distance \u2264k from the root,\u201d hence open), and the meagreness status of S_P is root-invariant.\\nProof. Each A_k is saturated under re-rooting by Lemma 3 on subbasic open sets, and meagreness of \\\\bigcup_k A_k is determined by the meagreness of its pieces, which is preserved under the local re-rooting homeomorphisms. Hence the status is independent of which vertex is singled out as the root.\\n\\nDiscussion and obstacles for the general meagreness case\\n- For arbitrary (possibly highly nonlocal) P, S_P need not be Borel of simple rank; meagreness is subtler than nowhere denseness. Lemma 3 nevertheless shows that re-rooting is implementable as a homeomorphism on arbitrarily small basic neighborhoods. This implies: a saturated set S is meagre (resp. nonmeagre) on a basic neighborhood iff its re-rooted counterpart is meagre (resp. nonmeagre) on the re-rooted basic neighborhood. What is missing for a complete proof is a canonical way to patch these local equivalences into a global statement without assuming that such re-rootable neighborhoods form a countable open cover of X (they do not necessarily cover X, since we cannot force markers into a fixed point\u2019s ball).\\n- A promising route: work with the comeagre set of points admitting infinitely many radii at which their r-balls are \u201cmarker-ready\u201d (i.e., rigid enough to admit a unique coded beacon within one more step). It is standard in similar inverse limit spaces that such points form a dense G_\u03b4 (one can refine radii where the boundary has degree slack and exploit rigidity of finite trees). On this comeagre set Y, one expects to define a countable family of partial re-rooting homeomorphisms whose domains partition Y; then invariance of meagreness on Y follows. Because removing a meagre set from the ambient space does not affect meagreness of a subset, this would settle the general case.\\n\\nExamples and sanity checks\\n- P = \u201chas a 2-way infinite bridge.\u201d By Theorem 16 in the provided abstract, S_P is meagre but not nowhere dense. Our arguments are consistent: the nowhere-dense part is root-invariant; the meagre status is stable under local re-rootings by the discussion above.\\n- P = \u201cis bridgeless.\u201d By Theorem 14, S_P is nowhere dense (in the regimes stated), hence root-invariant by Proposition 2.\\n\\nSummary of progress\\n- Proved root-invariance for nowhere denseness (Proposition 2) for all unrooted properties P, via a basis-level characterization that does not depend on how the root is chosen.\\n- Established a robust local re-rooting homeomorphism (Lemma 3) and used it to prove meagreness root-invariance for all local-existential properties (Proposition 4), and to reduce the general meagreness case to constructing a comeagre domain partitioned by re-rootable basic opens. This gives a concrete, testable plan for the verifier to either complete the proof or seek a counterexample by violating the existence of such a comeagre partition.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Formalize and prove the \u201ccomeagre marker-ready set\u201d existence and its partition by domains of partial re-rooting homeomorphisms. Then conclude full root-invariance for meagreness.\\n- Alternatively, search for a counterexample by constructing a nonlocal P whose S_P exhibits local nonmeagreness on some basic open sets but not on their re-rooted counterparts; Lemma 3 suggests this is unlikely, but a precise obstruction would be valuable.\\n\"\n}",
