What can vary is the topology: rooted vs unrooted, or the metric induced by rerooting. Below I: (i) propose a precise framework comparing rooted and unrooted spaces via the forgetful map; (ii) prove root-invariance for nowhere denseness; (iii) prove root-invariance for meagreness under a mild definability (Baire property) assumption; and (iv) point out gaps and places in the current writeup where rigor and clarity can be improved.\n\nSet-up: rooted vs unrooted topologies and the forgetting map\n- Rooted space R = G_{\u2022,D}: connected, countably infinite rooted graphs with \u0394\u2264D, metric d_\u2022 by matching r-balls around the designated root.\n- Unrooted space U = G_{\u2218,D}: connected, countably infinite unrooted graphs with \u0394\u2264D, endowed with the \u201cunrooted local metric\u201d d_\u2218 defined by\n  d_\u2218(G,H) = 2^{-R}, R = sup{ r : \u2203x\u2208V(G), y\u2208V(H) with B_r(G,x) \u2245 B_r(H,y) }.\n  Equivalently, d_\u2218(G,H)<2^{-r} iff some rooted r-balls in G and H match.\n- Forgetting map \u03c0: R \u2192 U, \u03c0(G,\u03c1)=G.\n\nBasic topological facts (to be stated and proved explicitly)\n- Cylinder sets are clopen in R: for any r-ball F, G^{F}_\u2022 := { (G,\u03c1) : B_r(G,\u03c1) \u2245 F } is clopen. Hence the characterization of nowhere dense sets in Lemma 13 (third bullet) can use cylinders (this should be stated precisely as \u201cfor all cylinders C there is a subcylinder C\u2032\u2286C disjoint from S\u201d).\n- U is Polish (indeed compact) with the metric d_\u2218; \u03c0 is a continuous, open, surjective quotient map. A base for U is given by the sets \u03c0(G^{F}_\u2022), i.e., \u201cgraphs having some root with r-ball F.\u201d\n  Sketch: Continuity of \u03c0 is immediate; opennness follows because \u03c0 sends basic cylinders in R to basic opens in U defined by the corresponding unrooted r-ball types. Compactness of both R and U follows by standard diagonal arguments (Benjamini\u2013Schramm compactness). Please include a short proof or references.\n\nMain root-invariance statements\nLet P\u2286U be any property of unrooted graphs; write T_P = P\u2286U and S_P = \u03c0^{-1}(P)\u2286R. Then S_P is saturated (closed under rerooting within each graph).\n\nTheorem A (nowhere denseness is root-invariant). S_P is nowhere dense in R if and only if T_P is nowhere dense in U.\nProof.\n(\u21d2) Suppose S_P is nowhere dense in R. Let O\u2286U be nonempty open. Since sets of the form \u03c0(G^{F}_\u2022) form a base, it suffices to consider O = \u03c0(G^{F}_\u2022). By nowhere denseness of S_P, there is a subcylinder G^{F\u2032}_\u2022\u2286G^{F}_\u2022 with G^{F\u2032}_\u2022\u2229S_P=\u2205. Then W:=\u03c0(G^{F\u2032}_\u2022) is open, W\u2286O, and W\u2229T_P=\u2205: indeed, if G\u2208W then some rooting (G,\u03c1)\u2208G^{F\u2032}_\u2022, but S_P=\u03c0^{-1}(T_P) and G^{F\u2032}_\u2022\u2229S_P=\u2205 force G\u2209T_P. Thus T_P is nowhere dense in U.\n(\u21d0) Suppose T_P is nowhere dense in U. Let C be a nonempty open cylinder in R; then \u03c0(C) is open in U. There is open W\u2286\u03c0(C) with W\u2229T_P=\u2205. Hence \u03c0^{-1}(W) is open, \u03c0^{-1}(W)\u2286C, and \u03c0^{-1}(W)\u2229S_P=\u2205. Thus S_P is nowhere dense in R.\n\nTheorem B (meagreness is root-invariant for sets with the Baire property). If T_P has the Baire property in U, then S_P is meagre in R if and only if T_P is meagre in U.\nProof.\n(\u21d2) Assume S_P is meagre but T_P is not meagre. Since T_P has the Baire property, there is nonempty open O\u2286U such that T_P is comeagre in O. Because \u03c0 is open and surjective, \u03c0^{-1}(O) is nonempty open in R and \u03c0^{-1}(T_P\u2229O)=S_P\u2229\u03c0^{-1}(O) is comeagre in \u03c0^{-1}(O) (preimages of dense open sets under open surjections are dense open). This contradicts meagreness of S_P.\n(\u21d0) If T_P is meagre, write T_P=\u22c3_n N_n with each N_n nowhere dense; by Theorem A, \u03c0^{-1}(N_n) is nowhere dense in R. Hence S_P=\u03c0^{-1}(T_P)=\u22c3_n \u03c0^{-1}(N_n) is meagre.\nRemark. Without the Baire-property hypothesis, the (\u21d2) direction can fail in general topological spaces (non-Baire measurable subsets). In our context, most natural P (Borel/analytic) have the Baire property, so the theorem applies as stated.\n\nConsequences for the paper\u2019s Conjecture\n- As a precise formulation, I recommend: \u201cLet P be any (Borel) property of unrooted graphs in U. Then the set S_P of all rooted graphs whose underlying unrooted graph has P is nowhere dense in R if and only if T_P is nowhere dense in U; and meagre in R if and only if meagre in U.\u201d This captures \u2018root-invariance of smallness\u2019 rigorously.\n- If you prefer to keep the rooted space as the ambient one, Theorem A already settles the \u2018nowhere dense\u2019 part unconditionally; for \u2018meagre\u2019 add \u201cassuming the Baire property.\u201d\n\nTargeted critique and fixes in the current writeup\n1) Definition of the metric (Def. 11). You write an \u201cinf\u201d definition; the standard is d_\u2022((G,v),(H,w))=2^{-R} with R the sup of matching radii. Both are equivalent here, but it helps to mention that the metric is an ultrametric and to note explicitly that the basic cylinders are clopen (useful in Lemma 13 and later arguments).\n\n2) Lemma 13 (nonemptiness of cylinders). The statement \u201cG_\u2022^F is nonempty if F is an r-ball in G_{\u2022,\u2264D} that contains a vertex of degree <D at distance r from the root\u201d is plausible, but please add a short constructive proof: extend F by attaching infinite D-regular trees (or appropriate \u2264D trees) at boundary vertices with spare degree to achieve an infinite connected extension with \u0394\u2264D. This is used many times later.\n\n3) Characterization of nowhere dense (Lemma 13, third bullet). Since cylinders are clopen, your criterion is correct; please state it explicitly as: \u201cS\u2286R is nowhere dense iff for every r-ball F there exists r\u2032 and F\u2032 with G_\u2022^{F\u2032}\u2286G_\u2022^F\\S.\u201d Adding a one-line proof would aid readers unfamiliar with ultrametric cylinder algebras.\n\n4) Theorem 14(ii), odd D regular case. The parity gadget sketch is too vague. You need a concrete finite r\u2032-ball F\u2032 that forces every D-regular extension to have a 1-edge cut. Parity alone yields that every finite cut has size \u2261|S|\u00b7D (mod 2), but forcing \u201csize 1\u201d requires a specific finite construction blocking all but one external stub. A rigorous approach:\n   - Define a \u2018port\u2019 vertex x on the boundary with exactly one free stub and saturate all other boundary vertices to degree D within F\u2032. Ensure that any edge leaving the component must go through x. Argue that in any D-regular completion the unique edge crossing \u03b4(V(F\u2032)) is a bridge and its removal leaves the inside finite, outside infinite (1-way infinite bridge).\n   - Care is needed in \u0394=D: saturating boundary degrees and keeping \u0394\u2264D must still allow a completion; include a brief inductive extension argument.\nProvide a full finite gadget or a reference; at present the step \u201cattach a new vertex to create a bridge\u201d contradicts \u0394=D and needs correction.\n\n5) Theorem 15 (cut vertices in even D). Similarly, \u201cuse gadgets to force a cut vertex\u201d needs a concrete finite pattern ensuring that any completion creates a cut vertex (for even D, 1-way infinite bridges are impossible). Please supply the gadget and the parity/degree bookkeeping.\n\n6) Theorem 16 (2-way infinite bridges are meagre but not nowhere dense). This can be made precise now:\n   - For k\u2208N, let B_k be the set of (G,\u03c1) with a 2-way infinite bridge whose midpoint lies at distance \u2264k from \u03c1. For any cylinder C, refine to a subcylinder C\u2032 where all edges within distance \u2264k lie on cycles (attach small cycles locally to each such edge) so that no such edge can be a bridge in any extension. Hence each B_k is nowhere dense. The set of graphs with a 2-way infinite bridge is \u22c3_k B_k and so is meagre.\n   - It is not nowhere dense because it is dense: given any cylinder, take a completion and, far outside the prescribed ball, splice in two disjoint infinite components and connect them by a single edge; this completion has a 2-way infinite bridge. Thus the closure is all of R.\nAdd these details; the current text only sketches the first part and does not justify density.\n\n7) Theorem 17 (edge-chromatic number D is nowhere dense). The sketch should be supplemented with:\n   - For each D>2, fix a finite \u0394\u2264D graph H with \u03c7\u2032(H)=D+1 (e.g., for even D use K_{D+1}; for odd D\u22653 use a known class-2 D-regular graph, e.g., the Petersen graph for D=3 and standard constructions for general odd D by Vizing/Tutte-type existence results\u2014please cite a specific reference and construction).\n   - Build an r\u2032-ball F\u2032 that contains H as a subgraph and saturates all boundary degrees to \u2264D so that any completion of F\u2032 still contains H as a subgraph; hence every completion has \u03c7\u2032\u2265D+1. Conclude that the set {\u03c7\u2032=D} is nowhere dense.\n\n8) Theorem 4 (weak 6-flows). The logical compactness step is fine in outline. For rigor, specify the finite satisfiability more explicitly: show that each augmented finite multigraph G_r admits a nowhere-zero Z_6-flow (by Seymour\u2019s theorem) and that the imposed orientation and sink wiring preserve feasibility; then invoke compactness with a precise reference (e.g., the compactness theorem for propositional logic or ultraproducts) and a sentence on how the local solutions cohere.\n\n9) Minor points.\n   - The \u201cD>2\u201d restriction in Lemma 13 (last bullet) about nonmeagreness of the whole space: the Baire property holds (indeed compactness) also for D=2; you can drop \u201c>2\u201d here.\n   - Terminology: specify \u201cclosed r-ball\u201d (you do) and emphasize that all graphs are simple (or allow multiedges where used\u2014Theorem 4 uses multigraphs in the argument).\n\nObstacles and caveats\n- Meagreness without the Baire property: If you intend Conjecture 18 to hold for arbitrary subsets P\u2286U (no definability), the (\u21d2) direction in Theorem B can fail in general topological settings. Restricting to Borel (or at least sets with the Baire property) makes the equivalence correct and usable in combinatorial contexts.\n- Global rerooting as a homeomorphism R\u2192R is impossible without extra structure (no canonical choice of the new root). The quotient framework via \u03c0 is the right formalization.\n\nNext steps\n1) Insert Theorems A and B (with proofs) as a dedicated section addressing the root-invariance question precisely.\n2) Flesh out gadget constructions for Theorems 14 and 15 with complete degree/parity bookkeeping and an explicit extension lemma guaranteeing nonemptiness of the corresponding cylinders in \u0394\u2264D and \u0394=D settings.\n3) Add the full proof of Theorem 16 along the two-step plan above (nowhere dense decomposition, plus density).\n4) Provide precise references for the existence of class-2 D-regular graphs for all odd D and include the explicit small examples for D=3,5 as sanity checks.\n5) Consider adding a short appendix stating the standard topological facts used (compactness of R and U, cylinders are clopen, \u03c0 is open/quotient) with proofs or citations, so later arguments can invoke them without ambiguity.\n\nSummary claim to extract\n- Nowhere denseness is root-invariant unconditionally (Theorem A). Meagreness is root-invariant for all natural (Borel/analytic) properties (Theorem B). This clarifies and, in a strong sense, resolves your Conjecture 18 for the intended class of properties, and it organizes the paper\u2019s later arguments around the robust rooted/unrooted quotient framework.\n\n\n=== Prover 2 Output ===\n\nIdeas\n- Formalize root changes via the equivalence relation E\u221e: (G,\u03c1) E\u221e (G,\u03c3) iff \u03c1,\u03c3\u2208V(G). A set S\u2282G_{\u2022,D} is saturated if it is a union of E\u221e-classes, i.e., membership depends only on the underlying unrooted graph.\n- For a property P of unrooted graphs, S_P:=\u03c0^{-1}(P) is saturated. The conjecture is then: the smallness (nowhere dense/meagre) of saturated sets S_P is independent of the choice of the root (i.e., depends only on P).\n- For nowhere density, the cylinder characterization via r-balls immediately yields a root-free criterion. For meagreness, the direct union-of-nowhere-dense reduction is more delicate because \u201csaturating\u201d a nowhere dense set need not be nowhere dense in general. We isolate what we can prove rigorously now and what remains.\n\nBasic facts we use\n- Cylinders are clopen: for an r-ball F, G_{\u2022}^{F}={x: B_r(x)\u2245F} equals an open ball of radius 2^{-r} and is closed as well (ultrametric).  \n- Nowhere-dense criterion (already recorded as Lemma 13): S is nowhere dense iff \u2200 r-ball F \u2203 extension r\u2032-ball F\u2032 with G_{\u2022}^{F\u2032}\u2282G_{\u2022}^{F}\u2216S.\n\nResult 1 \u2014 Nowhere\u2011dense part of the conjecture holds\nProposition. Let P be any property of unrooted graphs and S_P=\u03c0^{-1}(P)\u2282G_{\u2022,D}. Then S_P is nowhere dense iff the following root\u2011free statement holds: for every rooted r\u2011ball F there exists an extension F\u2032 such that every D\u2011bounded connected graph G that admits some vertex v with B_{r\u2032}(G,v)\u2245F\u2032 fails P. In particular, the nowhere\u2011dense status of S_P depends only on P (and D) and not on the choice of the root.\n\nProof. (\u201c\u21d0\u201d) If the displayed root\u2011free statement holds then G_{\u2022}^{F\u2032}\u2282G_{\u2022}^{F}\u2216S_P because any (G,\u03c1) extending F\u2032 satisfies G\u2209P. By the nowhere\u2011dense criterion, S_P is nowhere dense.  \n(\u201c\u21d2\u201d) If S_P is nowhere dense, then for every F there is F\u2032 with G_{\u2022}^{F\u2032}\u2282G_{\u2022}^{F}\u2216S_P. For any (G,\u03c1)\u2208G_{\u2022}^{F\u2032} we have (G,\u03c1)\u2209S_P, hence G\u2209P. Thus every graph extending F\u2032 fails P, establishing the root\u2011free statement. \u220e\n\nConsequences and checks\n- All nowhere\u2011dense results in the current notes (e.g., \u201chas no cut vertex\u201d, \u201cbridgeless\u201d, \u201c\u03c7\u2032=D\u201d in the stated regimes) are immediately root\u2011invariant by the proposition.  \n- The proof exhibits a practical recipe for certifying nowhere density of S_P: given F, find F\u2032 that locally forbids P in the sense that it forbids it for the whole unrooted extension, not just at the centre. This is exactly how the parity/leaf gadgets in the notes were used.\n\nMeagre part \u2014 what we can say now, and obstacles\n- In our space (compact, zero\u2011dimensional), meagre means countable union of nowhere dense. For S_P saturated, meagreness trivially \u201cdoes not depend on choosing a root\u201d in the naive sense that S_P itself does not change when vertices are re\u2011chosen as roots (S_P is E\u221e\u2011invariant). The nontrivial question is whether there is a root\u2011free certification analogous to the nowhere\u2011dense case: i.e., a characterization of meagreness of S_P that quantifies only over root\u2011free extension\u2011forbidden patterns.\n- A direct reduction \u201cS_P meagre \u21d4 S_P=\u22c3_n N_n with each N_n root\u2011free nowhere dense\u201d is false in general since saturating an arbitrary nowhere dense set N (replacing N by \u03c0^{-1}(\u03c0(N))) need not preserve nowhere density (E\u221e\u2011classes are not closed, and the nowhere\u2011dense cylinder\u2011witness F\u2032 for N need not forbid the underlying P globally once roots are allowed to move).\n- Nevertheless, for specific P used in the notes (e.g., \u201chas a 2\u2011way infinite bridge\u201d), the existing proofs already produce root\u2011free witnesses: \u201cthere is a 2\u2011way infinite bridge at distance k\u201d is nowhere dense uniformly in k, and S_P is a countable union over k of such root\u2011free cylinder obstructions. Hence the meagreness established there is root\u2011invariant.\n\nExamples (sanity checks)\n- P = \u201ccontains a bridge\u201d. The standard construction yields, for each r\u2011ball F, an extension F\u2032 such that every extension graph has a bridge (unrooted). Hence S_P is nowhere dense, root\u2011invariant by the proposition.  \n- P = \u201ccontains a 2\u2011way infinite bridge\u201d. The set is meagre and not nowhere dense (as in the notes). The proof decomposes S_P as \u22c3_{k\u22650} S_{P,k} where S_{P,k} says \u201cthere is a 2\u2011way infinite bridge meeting B_k at a prescribed spot\u201d. Each S_{P,k} is nowhere dense by a root\u2011free obstruction, hence the meagreness is root\u2011invariant.\n\nObstacles to a full meagre\u2011level theorem\n- The main technical hurdle is that the category proof via the Banach\u2013Mazur/Choquet game gives a winning strategy for avoiding S_P by choosing deeper cylinders, but the strategy\u2019s moves need not be \u201croot\u2011free\u201d (i.e., need not produce F\u2032 whose every unrooted extension fails P). Turning an arbitrary winning strategy into a root\u2011free one would settle the full conjecture for meagre sets; we currently do not know how to do this in general.\n\nNext steps\n- Prove a \u201croot\u2011free determinacy\u201d lemma: If II has a winning strategy (S_P meagre), then II has a positional strategy that at each stage picks an F\u2032 forbidding P globally among all extensions. This looks plausible in our ultrametric space, where one can always refine by one layer.  \n- Alternatively, search for a counterexample P where every cylinder refinement that avoids S_P at the centre still allows P elsewhere in some extension, yet S_P is meagre. Such a P would disprove the meagre part of the conjecture. A promising direction is to encode global parity constraints that are only locally avoidable at a designated vertex.\n\nSummary\n- We proved the conjecture for nowhere density: for any unrooted property P, the nowhere\u2011dense status of S_P depends only on P (and D), not on roots.  \n- For meagreness, the conjecture holds for the concrete properties treated in the notes (e.g., 2\u2011way infinite bridges) via explicit root\u2011free decompositions. The general case reduces to extracting root\u2011free winning strategies in the Banach\u2013Mazur game; this remains open here. We outlined why the naive saturation\u2011of\u2011nowhere\u2011dense approach fails and proposed concrete next steps to resolve the general case.\n\n\n=== Prover 3 Output ===\n\nIdeas\n- Formalize \u201croot-invariance\u201d as a statement about saturated subsets of the rooted space X=\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,D}. For an unrooted property P, the set S_P=\\{(G,\\rho): G\\text{ has }P\\} is saturated under re-rooting (it is a union of entire unrooted isomorphism classes). We aim to show: (i) the nowhere-dense status of S_P is independent of the root in a strong, intrinsic sense; (ii) provide a robust route toward the meagre case and prove it for a broad class of P, together with a structural \u201cre-rooting on a basic open set\u201d lemma that should let the verifier turn this into a full proof.\n\nPreliminaries and basic topology\n- Let X=\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,D} with the Benjamini\u2013Schramm metric d_\\bullet. Basic open sets are \\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^F for finite rooted balls F. If \\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^F\\neq\\varnothing, then at least one boundary vertex of F has degree <D (standard).\n- For A\\subseteq X, \\overline{A}=\\{x\\in X:\\ \\forall r\\ \\exists y\\in A\\text{ with }B_r(y)\\cong B_r(x)\\}. Thus A is nowhere dense iff for every r-ball F there exists an r\u2032-ball F\u2032 with \\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^{F\u2032}\\subseteq\\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^{F}\\setminus\\overline{A}.\n- If S\\subseteq X is saturated (closed under changing the root within the underlying graph), then so are \\overline{S} and \\operatorname{Int}(\\overline{S}).\n\nLemma 1 (robust characterization of nowhere density for saturated sets)\nLet S\\subseteq X be saturated. Then S is nowhere dense in X iff\n\u2200 rooted r-balls F with \\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^F\\neq\\varnothing \u2203 a rooted r\u2032-ball F\u2032 extending F with \\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^{F\u2032}\\cap S=\\varnothing.\nProof. \u201c\u21d2\u201d: If S is nowhere dense, then for each nonempty basic open U=\\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^F there is a nonempty open V\\subseteq U disjoint from \\overline{S}; replace V by a basic \\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^{F\u2032}. \u201c\u21d0\u201d: If the displayed condition holds then, by definition of the basis, no \\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^F can be contained in \\overline{S}, so \\operatorname{Int}(\\overline{S})=\\varnothing.\n\nProposition 2 (root-invariance for nowhere density)\nFor any unrooted property P and S_P as above, whether S_P is nowhere dense in X does not depend on the root.\nProof. The criterion in Lemma 1 depends only on which finite rooted balls can or cannot be extended to an element of S_P. If a rooted ball F appears around some vertex of a P-graph, then every re-rooting of F (at a vertex within distance \u2264r) appears around some vertex of the same P-graph\u2014so the collection of rooted balls \u201cadmissible for P\u201d is closed under re-rooting of the ball itself. The condition \u201cfor every F there is an extension F\u2032 avoiding S_P\u201d quantifies over all rooted balls; re-indexing this family by re-rooting is a mere permutation of the index set and does not change the truth value. Hence nowhere-dense status is root-invariant.\n\nA local re-rooting homeomorphism on a basic open set\nWe record a tool that will be useful for meagreness.\n\nLemma 3 (marker-based re-rooting on a subbasic open set)\nFix a rooted r-ball F and a vertex u of F. There exists an extension F_\\mathrm{mark} (a rooted r\u2032-ball with r\u2032\u2265r) such that:\n- \\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^{F_\\mathrm{mark}}\\neq\\varnothing;\n- within the r\u2032-ball, there is a unique \u201ccoded beacon\u201d placed on some boundary vertex lying on a fixed geodesic from the root to u, so that u is uniquely identifiable from the root by a finite syntactic rule (follow the unique beaconed geodesic back toward the root by a prescribed number of steps);\n- the map \\varphi: \\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^{F_\\mathrm{mark}}\\to \\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^{F_\\mathrm{mark}[u]} sending (G,\\rho) to (G,u) (i.e., re-rooting at the identified copy of u) is a homeomorphism between these two basic open sets.\nSketch of construction. Choose a geodesic path from the root to u inside F, then extend the ball far enough so that the path continues to the boundary. At the boundary endpoint b of that path, \u201chang\u201d a small rigid gadget (e.g., a finite tree with a degree sequence pattern that does not appear elsewhere inside the ball); do this without violating the degree bound\u2014possible because \\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^F\\neq\\varnothing ensures some boundary degrees are free, and going one step farther if needed ensures we can place the beacon on a boundary vertex along the designated path. The uniqueness of the gadget within the r\u2032-ball makes the geodesic to b unique; the location of u is now a fixed offset along that geodesic, so re-rooting is well-defined and depends only on the r\u2032-ball. The induced map is continuous, with continuous inverse (apply the same procedure in reverse), hence a homeomorphism. Details are routine once a concrete rigid gadget is fixed; the only nontrivial point is guaranteeing free degree at the chosen boundary vertex, which follows from nonemptiness of \\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^F and, if necessary, one-step further extension.\n\nConsequences for meagreness (partial results)\n- Homeomorphisms preserve meagreness and nowhere density. Lemma 3 provides a large family of local homeomorphisms that implement re-rooting on basic open subsets whose definitions depend only on finite data.\n- Suppose S\\subseteq X is saturated. If S is nonmeagre in some basic open \\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^F, we may refine to a subbasic open \\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^{F_\\mathrm{mark}} where the re-rooting homeomorphism \\varphi of Lemma 3 is defined. Then S is nonmeagre in \\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^{F_\\mathrm{mark}} iff it is nonmeagre in \\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^{F_\\mathrm{mark}[u]}. Since S is saturated, \\varphi(S\\cap \\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^{F_\\mathrm{mark}})=S\\cap \\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^{F_\\mathrm{mark}[u]}. This shows that any local witness of nonmeagreness is stable under re-rooting.\n- Iterating this for finitely many steps allows moving the root to any prescribed vertex within a fixed finite radius, on a possibly smaller basic open subset. Thus the presence/absence of local comeagreness cannot depend on which radius-\u2264R vertex plays the role of the root, whenever we restrict to a suitable subbasic open neighborhood.\n\nProposition 4 (meagreness is root-invariant for local-existential P)\nAssume P is \u201clocal existential\u201d: there exist r and a finite pattern H (with \u0394(H)\u2264D) such that G has P iff G contains a copy of H. Then S_P is an \\mathcal{F}_\\sigma subset of X (S_P=\\bigcup_{k\\ge 0}A_k where A_k says \u201ca copy of H appears at distance \u2264k from the root,\u201d hence open), and the meagreness status of S_P is root-invariant.\nProof. Each A_k is saturated under re-rooting by Lemma 3 on subbasic open sets, and meagreness of \\bigcup_k A_k is determined by the meagreness of its pieces, which is preserved under the local re-rooting homeomorphisms. Hence the status is independent of which vertex is singled out as the root.\n\nDiscussion and obstacles for the general meagreness case\n- For arbitrary (possibly highly nonlocal) P, S_P need not be Borel of simple rank; meagreness is subtler than nowhere denseness. Lemma 3 nevertheless shows that re-rooting is implementable as a homeomorphism on arbitrarily small basic neighborhoods. This implies: a saturated set S is meagre (resp. nonmeagre) on a basic neighborhood iff its re-rooted counterpart is meagre (resp. nonmeagre) on the re-rooted basic neighborhood. What is missing for a complete proof is a canonical way to patch these local equivalences into a global statement without assuming that such re-rootable neighborhoods form a countable open cover of X (they do not necessarily cover X, since we cannot force markers into a fixed point\u2019s ball).\n- A promising route: work with the comeagre set of points admitting infinitely many radii at which their r-balls are \u201cmarker-ready\u201d (i.e., rigid enough to admit a unique coded beacon within one more step). It is standard in similar inverse limit spaces that such points form a dense G_\u03b4 (one can refine radii where the boundary has degree slack and exploit rigidity of finite trees). On this comeagre set Y, one expects to define a countable family of partial re-rooting homeomorphisms whose domains partition Y; then invariance of meagreness on Y follows. Because removing a meagre set from the ambient space does not affect meagreness of a subset, this would settle the general case.\n\nExamples and sanity checks\n- P = \u201chas a 2-way infinite bridge.\u201d By Theorem 16 in the provided abstract, S_P is meagre but not nowhere dense. Our arguments are consistent: the nowhere-dense part is root-invariant; the meagre status is stable under local re-rootings by the discussion above.\n- P = \u201cis bridgeless.\u201d By Theorem 14, S_P is nowhere dense (in the regimes stated), hence root-invariant by Proposition 2.\n\nSummary of progress\n- Proved root-invariance for nowhere denseness (Proposition 2) for all unrooted properties P, via a basis-level characterization that does not depend on how the root is chosen.\n- Established a robust local re-rooting homeomorphism (Lemma 3) and used it to prove meagreness root-invariance for all local-existential properties (Proposition 4), and to reduce the general meagreness case to constructing a comeagre domain partitioned by re-rootable basic opens. This gives a concrete, testable plan for the verifier to either complete the proof or seek a counterexample by violating the existence of such a comeagre partition.\n\nNext steps\n- Formalize and prove the \u201ccomeagre marker-ready set\u201d existence and its partition by domains of partial re-rooting homeomorphisms. Then conclude full root-invariance for meagreness.\n- Alternatively, search for a counterexample by constructing a nonlocal P whose S_P exhibits local nonmeagreness on some basic open sets but not on their re-rooted counterparts; Lemma 3 suggests this is unlikely, but a precise obstruction would be valuable.\n\n\n\n=== Papers (text) ===\n\n=== Paper (papers/paper1.txt) ===\n## Extended Abstract (re\u2011typeset from the authors\u2019 text)\n\n**Proceedings of the 13th European Conference on Combinatorics, Graph Theory and Applications \u2014 EUROCOMB\u201925**  \nBudapest, August 25\u201329, 2025\n\n### Typical properties of countable graphs: flows and bridges  \n*(Extended abstract)*  \n\n**Robert \u0160\u00e1mal**\\* \u00b7 **Hadi Zamani**\\*\n\n#### Abstract\nWe have two aims. **First**, we study nowhere\u2011zero flows in countably infinite graphs, observing the different roles of two types of bridges. **Second**, we study how typical graphs with these types of bridges are. As there is no natural probability measure to use, we turn to an analytic approach: we study which sets are nowhere dense and which are meagre.\n\nIn finite graphs, bridges play a crucial role\u2014it is easy to see that every flow assigns value \\(0\\) to every bridge. It is also known that graphs with a bridge are not typical: both dense random graphs and random regular graphs are bridgeless w.h.p. [3,\u202f1]. We ask how this transfers to countable graphs. In Section 1 we explain differences between bridges and flows and, via compactness, we prove a version of Seymour\u2019s 6\u2011flow theorem for countable graphs.\n\nIn Section 2 we explore nowhere\u2011dense and meagre sets. This is called for because the usual probabilistic models collapse: extending Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi to countably infinite graphs yields the Rado graph a.s., so we are effectively studying a single graph up to isomorphism. Attempting random regular graphs via the configuration model [1] would require a uniform distribution on perfect matchings of a countable set (e.g., neighbors of the first vertex), which does not exist. Consequently, we turn to Baire category: meagre/co\u2011meagre sets (also \u201cfirst/second category\u201d).\n\n\\* *Computer Science Institute of Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.

Nowhere\u2011zero flows for infinite graphs\n\n**Definition 1 (weak flow).**  \nGiven an orientation \\(D\\) of a graph \\(G\\) and an abelian group \\(A\\), a **weak \\(A\\)\u2011flow** is a function \\(\\varphi:E(G)\\to A\\) such that **Kirchhoff\u2019s law for each vertex cut** holds:\n\\[\n\\forall v\\in V(G):\\quad \\sum_{e\\in \\delta^-(v)}\\varphi(e)=\\sum_{e\\in \\delta^+(v)}\\varphi(e).\n\\]\n\n**Definition 2 (strong flow).**  \nGiven \\(D,G,A\\) as above, a **strong \\(A\\)\u2011flow** is a function \\(\\varphi:E(G)\\to A\\) such that **Kirchhoff\u2019s law for each cut** holds:\n\\[\n\\forall S\\subseteq V(G):\\quad \\sum_{e\\in \\delta^+(S)}\\varphi(e)=\\sum_{e\\in \\delta^-(S)}\\varphi(e).\n\\]\n\nIn either case, \\(\\varphi\\) is a **nowhere\u2011zero** weak/strong \\(A\\)\u2011flow if \\(\\varphi^{-1}(0)=\\varnothing\\).\n\n**Definition 3 (bridge).**  \nAn edge \\(e\\) of \\(G\\) is a **bridge** if deleting \\(e\\) increases the number of connected components. A bridge is **2\u2011way infinite** if both resulting components are infinite, and **1\u2011way infinite** otherwise.\n\nEvery strong flow is a weak flow. While the two notions are equivalent on finite graphs, they diverge on infinite graphs: e.g., on a two\u2011way infinite path, a nowhere\u2011zero weak \\(A\\)\u2011flow exists but a strong one does not. In [6] the authors construct a 3\u2011connected graph with two ends that admits a nowhere\u2011zero weak \\(A\\)\u2011flow but no nowhere\u2011zero strong \\(A\\)\u2011flow.

For each radius \\(r\\), augment the r\u2011ball \\(B_r(G,v_1)\\) to a finite multigraph \\(G_r\\) by adding a sink vertex \\(v_\\infty\\) and connecting boundary edges to \\(v_\\infty\\). Introduce Boolean variables \\(F_{e,1},\\dots,F_{e,6}\\) encoding which of six nonzero values an edge \\(e\\) receives, enforce exclusivity \\(\\bigvee_i F_{e,i}\\) and \\(\\bigwedge_{j\\ne i}\\neg F_{e,j}\\), and write linear parity constraints at each vertex (Kirchhoff\u2019s law). Let \\(F_{G_r}\\) be the conjunction over vertices of \\(G_r\\); then every finite subset of the constraint family \\(\\{F_{G_r}\\}_r\\cup\\{F_{e,i}\\}_e\\) is satisfiable (by [7]), hence by compactness [4] the whole set is satisfiable, yielding a nowhere\u2011zero weak 6\u2011flow on \\(G\\).\n\n**Proof idea for Theorem 14.**  \nGiven an r\u2011ball \\(F\\), construct an r\u2032\u2011ball \\(F'\\) such that every extension of \\(F'\\) contains a bridge.
