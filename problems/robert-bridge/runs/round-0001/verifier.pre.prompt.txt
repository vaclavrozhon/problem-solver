=== SYSTEM ===
You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md, proofs.md, and output.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers
- notes.md (informal progress & exploratory work so far)
- proofs.md (rigorous proofs & detailed mathematics so far)
- output.md (main results found so far)

**Three-tier file system guidelines**:
- **notes.md**: Readable, log of exploratory work, intuitions, failed attempts, ideas. Prefer appending. Replace only if old notes are clearly misleading. It should be self-contained: In particular, reading it should make sense without knowing the output of provers in past rounds. 

- **proofs.md**: Complete rigorous mathematical proofs with full details. Think twice before adding anything. Contains proven lemmas, theorems, and detailed derivations. Only add mathematically verified content here.
- **output.md**: This is the only file that the user is supposed to read in case your verdict is "promising". It has to be self-contained. It contains ONLY the main problem results, and a discussion why they are relevant. It is extremely selective. Think twice before promoting proofs from proofs.md to output.md. Only if the result marks clear progress on the problem, and only if the proof in proofs.md has been thoroughly vetted by provers and you, it can join output.md. Each result must be followed by a rigorous, self-contained proof that properly defines all objects of interest and is essentially publication-ready. 

Tasks:
1) Audit rigor: identify unjustified steps, false statements, missing lemmas; produce minimal counterexamples.
2) Triage value: separate genuine progress from noise.
3) Guide next steps: propose what provers should try next.

## Setting

- Fix an integer \(D \ge 2\).
- Let \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) be the space of **countably infinite, connected, rooted graphs** \((G,\rho)\).
- For \((G,\rho) \in \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) and \(r \in \mathbb{N}\), let \(B_r(G,\rho)\) denote the rooted (closed) ball of radius \(r\) about \(\rho\).
- Equip \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) with the **local (Benjamini–Schramm) metric** \(d_\bullet\) given by
  \[
  d_\bullet\big((G,\rho),(H,\sigma)\big)=2^{-R},
  \qquad
  R=\sup\{r\in\mathbb{N} : B_r(G,\rho)\cong B_r(H,\sigma)\}.
  \]
  (Equivalently, \(d_\bullet((G,\rho),(H,\sigma))<2^{-r}\) iff \(B_r(G,\rho)\cong B_r(H,\sigma)\).)
- Degree‑constrained subspaces:
  - \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\): all rooted graphs with \(\Delta(G)\le D\).
  - \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,= D}\): all rooted graphs with \(\Delta(G)= D\).
  We write \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for either of these when the distinction is unimportant.
- A subset \(S\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) is **nowhere dense** if the interior of \(\overline{S}\) is empty. A set is **meagre** (first category) if it is a countable union of nowhere dense sets; its complement is **comeagre**. A property is called **typical** if the corresponding set is comeagre.
- An edge \(e\) of an (unrooted) graph \(G\) is a **bridge** if \(G-e\) has more connected components than \(G\). A bridge is **2‑way infinite** if both components are infinite and **1‑way infinite** otherwise.

## Conjecture  — Root‑invariance of smallness
Let \(P\) be any property of unrooted graphs and put

Ideas and scope
- The conjecture as written (“the smallness of SP does not depend on the choice of the root ρ”) is ambiguous: SP itself is already root-invariant (membership depends only on G). What can vary is the topology: rooted vs unrooted, or the metric induced by rerooting. Below I: (i) propose a precise framework comparing rooted and unrooted spaces via the forgetful map; (ii) prove root-invariance for nowhere denseness; (iii) prove root-invariance for meagreness under a mild definability (Baire property) assumption; and (iv) point out gaps and places in the current writeup where rigor and clarity can be improved.

Set-up: rooted vs unrooted topologies and the forgetting map
- Rooted space R = G_{•,D}: connected, countably infinite rooted graphs with Δ≤D, metric d_• by matching r-balls around the designated root.
- Unrooted space U = G_{∘,D}: connected, countably infinite unrooted graphs with Δ≤D, endowed with the “unrooted local metric” d_∘ defined by
  d_∘(G,H) = 2^{-R}, R = sup{ r : ∃x∈V(G), y∈V(H) with B_r(G,x) ≅ B_r(H,y) }.
  Equivalently, d_∘(G,H)<2^{-r} iff some rooted r-balls in G and H match.
- Forgetting map π: R → U, π(G,ρ)=G.

Basic topological facts (to be stated and proved explicitly)
- Cylinder sets are clopen in R: for any r-ball F, G^{F}_• := { (G,ρ) : B_r(G,ρ) ≅ F } is clopen. Hence the characterization of nowhere dense sets in Lemma 13 (third bullet) can use cylinders (this should be stated precisely as “for all cylinders C there is a subcylinder C′⊆C disjoint from S”).
- U is Polish (indeed compact) with the metric d_∘; π is a continuous, open, surjective quotient map. A base for U is given by the sets π(G^{F}_•), i.e., “graphs having some root with r-ball F.”
  Sketch: Continuity of π is immediate; opennness follows because π sends basic cylinders in R to basic opens in U defined by the corresponding unrooted r-ball types. Compactness of both R and U follows by standard diagonal arguments (Benjamini–Schramm compactness). Please include a short proof or references.

Main root-invariance statements
Let P⊆U be any property of unrooted graphs; write T_P = P⊆U and S_P = π^{-1}(P)⊆R. Then S_P is saturated (closed under rerooting within each graph).

Theorem A (nowhere denseness is root-invariant). S_P is nowhere dense in R if and only if T_P is nowhere dense in U.
Proof.
(⇒) Suppose S_P is nowhere dense in R. Let O⊆U be nonempty open. Since sets of the form π(G^{F}_•) form a base, it suffices to consider O = π(G^{F}_•). By nowhere denseness of S_P, there is a subcylinder G^{F′}_•⊆G^{F}_• with G^{F′}_•∩S_P=∅. Then W:=π(G^{F′}_•) is open, W⊆O, and W∩T_P=∅: indeed, if G∈W then some rooting (G,ρ)∈G^{F′}_•, but S_P=π^{-1}(T_P) and G^{F′}_•∩S_P=∅ force G∉T_P. Thus T_P is nowhere dense in U.
(⇐) Suppose T_P is nowhere dense in U. Let C be a nonempty open cylinder in R; then π(C) is open in U. There is open W⊆π(C) with W∩T_P=∅. Hence π^{-1}(W) is open, π^{-1}(W)⊆C, and π^{-1}(W)∩S_P=∅. Thus S_P is nowhere dense in R.

Theorem B (meagreness is root-invariant for sets with the Baire property). If T_P has the Baire property in U, then S_P is meagre in R if and only if T_P is meagre in U.
Proof.
(⇒) Assume S_P is meagre but T_P is not meagre. Since T_P has the Baire property, there is nonempty open O⊆U such that T_P is comeagre in O. Because π is open and surjective, π^{-1}(O) is nonempty open in R and π^{-1}(T_P∩O)=S_P∩π^{-1}(O) is comeagre in π^{-1}(O) (preimages of dense open sets under open surjections are dense open). This contradicts meagreness of S_P.
(⇐) If T_P is meagre, write T_P=⋃_n N_n with each N_n nowhere dense; by Theorem A, π^{-1}(N_n) is nowhere dense in R. Hence S_P=π^{-1}(T_P)=⋃_n π^{-1}(N_n) is meagre.
Remark. Without the Baire-property hypothesis, the (⇒) direction can fail in general topological spaces (non-Baire measurable subsets). In our context, most natural P (Borel/analytic) have the Baire property, so the theorem applies as stated.

Consequences for the paper’s Conjecture
- As a precise formulation, I recommend: “Let P be any (Borel) property of unrooted graphs in U. Then the set S_P of all rooted graphs whose underlying unrooted graph has P is nowhere dense in R if and only if T_P is nowhere dense in U; and meagre in R if and only if meagre in U.” This captures ‘root-invariance of smallness’ rigorously.
- If you prefer to keep the rooted space as the ambient one, Theorem A already settles the ‘nowhere dense’ part unconditionally; for ‘meagre’ add “assuming the Baire property.”

Targeted critique and fixes in the current writeup
1) Definition of the metric (Def. 11). You write an “inf” definition; the standard is d_•((G,v),(H,w))=2^{-R} with R the sup of matching radii. Both are equivalent here, but it helps to mention that the metric is an ultrametric and to note explicitly that the basic cylinders are clopen (useful in Lemma 13 and later arguments).

2) Lemma 13 (nonemptiness of cylinders). The statement “G_•^F is nonempty if F is an r-ball in G_{•,≤D} that contains a vertex of degree <D at distance r from the root” is plausible, but please add a short constructive proof: extend F by attaching infinite D-regular trees (or appropriate ≤D trees) at boundary vertices with spare degree to achieve an infinite connected extension with Δ≤D. This is used many times later.

3) Characterization of nowhere dense (Lemma 13, third bullet). Since cylinders are clopen, your criterion is correct; please state it explicitly as: “S⊆R is nowhere dense iff for every r-ball F there exists r′ and F′ with G_•^{F′}⊆G_•^F\S.” Adding a one-line proof would aid readers unfamiliar with ultrametric cylinder algebras.

4) Theorem 14(ii), odd D regular case. The parity gadget sketch is too vague. You need a concrete finite r′-ball F′ that forces every D-regular extension to have a 1-edge cut. Parity alone yields that every finite cut has size ≡|S|·D (mod 2), but forcing “size 1” requires a specific finite construction blocking all but one external stub. A rigorous approach:
   - Define a ‘port’ vertex x on the boundary with exactly one free stub and saturate all other boundary vertices to degree D within F′. Ensure that any edge leaving the component must go through x. Argue that in any D-regular completion the unique edge crossing δ(V(F′)) is a bridge and its removal leaves the inside finite, outside infinite (1-way infinite bridge).
   - Care is needed in Δ=D: saturating boundary degrees and keeping Δ≤D must still allow a completion; include a brief inductive extension argument.
Provide a full finite gadget or a reference; at present the step “attach a new vertex to create a bridge” contradicts Δ=D and needs correction.

5) Theorem 15 (cut vertices in even D). Similarly, “use gadgets to force a cut vertex” needs a concrete finite pattern ensuring that any completion creates a cut vertex (for even D, 1-way infinite bridges are impossible). Please supply the gadget and the parity/degree bookkeeping.

6) Theorem 16 (2-way infinite bridges are meagre but not nowhere dense). This can be made precise now:
   - For k∈N, let B_k be the set of (G,ρ) with a 2-way infinite bridge whose midpoint lies at distance ≤k from ρ. For any cylinder C, refine to a subcylinder C′ where all edges within distance ≤k lie on cycles (attach small cycles locally to each such edge) so that no such edge can be a bridge in any extension. Hence each B_k is nowhere dense. The set of graphs with a 2-way infinite bridge is ⋃_k B_k and so is meagre.
   - It is not nowhere dense because it is dense: given any cylinder, take a completion and, far outside the prescribed ball, splice in two disjoint infinite components and connect them by a single edge; this completion has a 2-way infinite bridge. Thus the closure is all of R.
Add these details; the current text only sketches the first part and does not justify density.

7) Theorem 17 (edge-chromatic number D is nowhere dense). The sketch should be supplemented with:
   - For each D>2, fix a finite Δ≤D graph H with χ′(H)=D+1 (e.g., for even D use K_{D+1}; for odd D≥3 use a known class-2 D-regular graph, e.g., the Petersen graph for D=3 and standard constructions for general odd D by Vizing/Tutte-type existence results—please cite a specific reference and construction).
   - Build an r′-ball F′ that contains H as a subgraph and saturates all boundary degrees to ≤D so that any completion of F′ still contains H as a subgraph; hence every completion has χ′≥D+1. Conclude that the set {χ′=D} is nowhere dense.

8) Theorem 4 (weak 6-flows). The logical compactness step is fine in outline. For rigor, specify the finite satisfiability more explicitly: show that each augmented finite multigraph G_r admits a nowhere-zero Z_6-flow (by Seymour’s theorem) and that the imposed orientation and sink wiring preserve feasibility; then invoke compactness with a precise reference (e.g., the compactness theorem for propositional logic or ultraproducts) and a sentence on how the local solutions cohere.

9) Minor points.
   - The “D>2” restriction in Lemma 13 (last bullet) about nonmeagreness of the whole space: the Baire property holds (indeed compactness) also for D=2; you can drop “>2” here.
   - Terminology: specify “closed r-ball” (you do) and emphasize that all graphs are simple (or allow multiedges where used—Theorem 4 uses multigraphs in the argument).

Obstacles and caveats
- Meagreness without the Baire property: If you intend Conjecture 18 to hold for arbitrary subsets P⊆U (no definability), the (⇒) direction in Theorem B can fail in general topological settings. Restricting to Borel (or at least sets with the Baire property) makes the equivalence correct and usable in combinatorial contexts.
- Global rerooting as a homeomorphism R→R is impossible without extra structure (no canonical choice of the new root). The quotient framework via π is the right formalization.

Next steps
1) Insert Theorems A and B (with proofs) as a dedicated section addressing the root-invariance question precisely.
2) Flesh out gadget constructions for Theorems 14 and 15 with complete degree/parity bookkeeping and an explicit extension lemma guaranteeing nonemptiness of the corresponding cylinders in Δ≤D and Δ=D settings.
3) Add the full proof of Theorem 16 along the two-step plan above (nowhere dense decomposition, plus density).
4) Provide precise references for the existence of class-2 D-regular graphs for all odd D and include the explicit small examples for D=3,5 as sanity checks.
5) Consider adding a short appendix stating the standard topological facts used (compactness of R and U, cylinders are clopen, π is open/quotient) with proofs or citations, so later arguments can invoke them without ambiguity.

Summary claim to extract
- Nowhere denseness is root-invariant unconditionally (Theorem A). Meagreness is root-invariant for all natural (Borel/analytic) properties (Theorem B). This clarifies and, in a strong sense, resolves your Conjecture 18 for the intended class of properties, and it organizes the paper’s later arguments around the robust rooted/unrooted quotient framework.

Ideas
- Formalize root changes via the equivalence relation E∞: (G,ρ) E∞ (G,σ) iff ρ,σ∈V(G). A set S⊂G_{•,D} is saturated if it is a union of E∞-classes, i.e., membership depends only on the underlying unrooted graph.
- For a property P of unrooted graphs, S_P:=π^{-1}(P) is saturated. The conjecture is then: the smallness (nowhere dense/meagre) of saturated sets S_P is independent of the choice of the root (i.e., depends only on P).
- For nowhere density, the cylinder characterization via r-balls immediately yields a root-free criterion. For meagreness, the direct union-of-nowhere-dense reduction is more delicate because “saturating” a nowhere dense set need not be nowhere dense in general. We isolate what we can prove rigorously now and what remains.

Basic facts we use
- Cylinders are clopen: for an r-ball F, G_{•}^{F}={x: B_r(x)≅F} equals an open ball of radius 2^{-r} and is closed as well (ultrametric).  
- Nowhere-dense criterion (already recorded as Lemma 13): S is nowhere dense iff ∀ r-ball F ∃ extension r′-ball F′ with G_{•}^{F′}⊂G_{•}^{F}∖S.

Result 1 — Nowhere‑dense part of the conjecture holds
Proposition. Let P be any property of unrooted graphs and S_P=π^{-1}(P)⊂G_{•,D}. Then S_P is nowhere dense iff the following root‑free statement holds: for every rooted r‑ball F there exists an extension F′ such that every D‑bounded connected graph G that admits some vertex v with B_{r′}(G,v)≅F′ fails P. In particular, the nowhere‑dense status of S_P depends only on P (and D) and not on the choice of the root.

Proof. (“⇐”) If the displayed root‑free statement holds then G_{•}^{F′}⊂G_{•}^{F}∖S_P because any (G,ρ) extending F′ satisfies G∉P. By the nowhere‑dense criterion, S_P is nowhere dense.  
(“⇒”) If S_P is nowhere dense, then for every F there is F′ with G_{•}^{F′}⊂G_{•}^{F}∖S_P. For any (G,ρ)∈G_{•}^{F′} we have (G,ρ)∉S_P, hence G∉P. Thus every graph extending F′ fails P, establishing the root‑free statement. ∎

Consequences and checks
- All nowhere‑dense results in the current notes (e.g., “has no cut vertex”, “bridgeless”, “χ′=D” in the stated regimes) are immediately root‑invariant by the proposition.  
- The proof exhibits a practical recipe for certifying nowhere density of S_P: given F, find F′ that locally forbids P in the sense that it forbids it for the whole unrooted extension, not just at the centre. This is exactly how the parity/leaf gadgets in the notes were used.

Meagre part — what we can say now, and obstacles
- In our space (compact, zero‑dimensional), meagre means countable union of nowhere dense. For S_P saturated, meagreness trivially “does not depend on choosing a root” in the naive sense that S_P itself does not change when vertices are re‑chosen as roots (S_P is E∞‑invariant). The nontrivial question is whether there is a root‑free certification analogous to the nowhere‑dense case: i.e., a characterization of meagreness of S_P that quantifies only over root‑free extension‑forbidden patterns.
- A direct reduction “S_P meagre ⇔ S_P=⋃_n N_n with each N_n root‑free nowhere dense” is false in general since saturating an arbitrary nowhere dense set N (replacing N by π^{-1}(π(N))) need not preserve nowhere density (E∞‑classes are not closed, and the nowhere‑dense cylinder‑witness F′ for N need not forbid the underlying P globally once roots are allowed to move).
- Nevertheless, for specific P used in the notes (e.g., “has a 2‑way infinite bridge”), the existing proofs already produce root‑free witnesses: “there is a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance k” is nowhere dense uniformly in k, and S_P is a countable union over k of such root‑free cylinder obstructions. Hence the meagreness established there is root‑invariant.

Examples (sanity checks)
- P = “contains a bridge”. The standard construction yields, for each r‑ball F, an extension F′ such that every extension graph has a bridge (unrooted). Hence S_P is nowhere dense, root‑invariant by the proposition.  
- P = “contains a 2‑way infinite bridge”. The set is meagre and not nowhere dense (as in the notes). The proof decomposes S_P as ⋃_{k≥0} S_{P,k} where S_{P,k} says “there is a 2‑way infinite bridge meeting B_k at a prescribed spot”. Each S_{P,k} is nowhere dense by a root‑free obstruction, hence the meagreness is root‑invariant.

Obstacles to a full meagre‑level theorem
- The main technical hurdle is that the category proof via the Banach–Mazur/Choquet game gives a winning strategy for avoiding S_P by choosing deeper cylinders, but the strategy’s moves need not be “root‑free” (i.e., need not produce F′ whose every unrooted extension fails P). Turning an arbitrary winning strategy into a root‑free one would settle the full conjecture for meagre sets; we currently do not know how to do this in general.

Next steps
- Prove a “root‑free determinacy” lemma: If II has a winning strategy (S_P meagre), then II has a positional strategy that at each stage picks an F′ forbidding P globally among all extensions. This looks plausible in our ultrametric space, where one can always refine by one layer.  
- Alternatively, search for a counterexample P where every cylinder refinement that avoids S_P at the centre still allows P elsewhere in some extension, yet S_P is meagre. Such a P would disprove the meagre part of the conjecture. A promising direction is to encode global parity constraints that are only locally avoidable at a designated vertex.

Summary
- We proved the conjecture for nowhere density: for any unrooted property P, the nowhere‑dense status of S_P depends only on P (and D), not on roots.  
- For meagreness, the conjecture holds for the concrete properties treated in the notes (e.g., 2‑way infinite bridges) via explicit root‑free decompositions. The general case reduces to extracting root‑free winning strategies in the Banach–Mazur game; this remains open here. We outlined why the naive saturation‑of‑nowhere‑dense approach fails and proposed concrete next steps to resolve the general case.


=== Prover 3 Output ===

Ideas
- Formalize “root-invariance” as a statement about saturated subsets of the rooted space X=\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}. For an unrooted property P, the set S_P=\{(G,\rho): G\text{ has }P\} is saturated under re-rooting (it is a union of entire unrooted isomorphism classes). We aim to show: (i) the nowhere-dense status of S_P is independent of the root in a strong, intrinsic sense; (ii) provide a robust route toward the meagre case and prove it for a broad class of P, together with a structural “re-rooting on a basic open set” lemma that should let the verifier turn this into a full proof.

Preliminaries and basic topology
- Let X=\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D} with the Benjamini–Schramm metric d_\bullet. Basic open sets are \mathbf{G}_\bullet^F for finite rooted balls F. If \mathbf{G}_\bullet^F\neq\varnothing, then at least one boundary vertex of F has degree <D (standard).
- For A\subseteq X, \overline{A}=\{x\in X:\ \forall r\ \exists y\in A\text{ with }B_r(y)\cong B_r(x)\}. Thus A is nowhere dense iff for every r-ball F there exists an r′-ball F′ with \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F′}\subseteq\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F}\setminus\overline{A}.
- If S\subseteq X is saturated (closed under changing the root within the underlying graph), then so are \overline{S} and \operatorname{Int}(\overline{S}).

Lemma 1 (robust characterization of nowhere density for saturated sets)
Let S\subseteq X be saturated. Then S is nowhere dense in X iff
∀ rooted r-balls F with \mathbf{G}_\bullet^F\neq\varnothing ∃ a rooted r′-ball F′ extending F with \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F′}\cap S=\varnothing.
Proof. “⇒”: If S is nowhere dense, then for each nonempty basic open U=\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F there is a nonempty open V\subseteq U disjoint from \overline{S}; replace V by a basic \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F′}. “⇐”: If the displayed condition holds then, by definition of the basis, no \mathbf{G}_\bullet^F can be contained in \overline{S}, so \operatorname{Int}(\overline{S})=\varnothing.

Proposition 2 (root-invariance for nowhere density)
For any unrooted property P and S_P as above, whether S_P is nowhere dense in X does not depend on the root.
Proof. The criterion in Lemma 1 depends only on which finite rooted balls can or cannot be extended to an element of S_P. If a rooted ball F appears around some vertex of a P-graph, then every re-rooting of F (at a vertex within distance ≤r) appears around some vertex of the same P-graph—so the collection of rooted balls “admissible for P” is closed under re-rooting of the ball itself. The condition “for every F there is an extension F′ avoiding S_P” quantifies over all rooted balls; re-indexing this family by re-rooting is a mere permutation of the index set and does not change the truth value. Hence nowhere-dense status is root-invariant.

A local re-rooting homeomorphism on a basic open set
We record a tool that will be useful for meagreness.

Lemma 3 (marker-based re-rooting on a subbasic open set)
Fix a rooted r-ball F and a vertex u of F. There exists an extension F_\mathrm{mark} (a rooted r′-ball with r′≥r) such that:
- \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F_\mathrm{mark}}\neq\varnothing;
- within the r′-ball, there is a unique “coded beacon” placed on some boundary vertex lying on a fixed geodesic from the root to u, so that u is uniquely identifiable from the root by a finite syntactic rule (follow the unique beaconed geodesic back toward the root by a prescribed number of steps);
- the map \varphi: \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F_\mathrm{mark}}\to \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F_\mathrm{mark}[u]} sending (G,\rho) to (G,u) (i.e., re-rooting at the identified copy of u) is a homeomorphism between these two basic open sets.
Sketch of construction. Choose a geodesic path from the root to u inside F, then extend the ball far enough so that the path continues to the boundary. At the boundary endpoint b of that path, “hang” a small rigid gadget (e.g., a finite tree with a degree sequence pattern that does not appear elsewhere inside the ball); do this without violating the degree bound—possible because \mathbf{G}_\bullet^F\neq\varnothing ensures some boundary degrees are free, and going one step farther if needed ensures we can place the beacon on a boundary vertex along the designated path. The uniqueness of the gadget within the r′-ball makes the geodesic to b unique; the location of u is now a fixed offset along that geodesic, so re-rooting is well-defined and depends only on the r′-ball. The induced map is continuous, with continuous inverse (apply the same procedure in reverse), hence a homeomorphism. Details are routine once a concrete rigid gadget is fixed; the only nontrivial point is guaranteeing free degree at the chosen boundary vertex, which follows from nonemptiness of \mathbf{G}_\bullet^F and, if necessary, one-step further extension.

Consequences for meagreness (partial results)
- Homeomorphisms preserve meagreness and nowhere density. Lemma 3 provides a large family of local homeomorphisms that implement re-rooting on basic open subsets whose definitions depend only on finite data.
- Suppose S\subseteq X is saturated. If S is nonmeagre in some basic open \mathbf{G}_\bullet^F, we may refine to a subbasic open \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F_\mathrm{mark}} where the re-rooting homeomorphism \varphi of Lemma 3 is defined. Then S is nonmeagre in \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F_\mathrm{mark}} iff it is nonmeagre in \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F_\mathrm{mark}[u]}. Since S is saturated, \varphi(S\cap \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F_\mathrm{mark}})=S\cap \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F_\mathrm{mark}[u]}. This shows that any local witness of nonmeagreness is stable under re-rooting.
- Iterating this for finitely many steps allows moving the root to any prescribed vertex within a fixed finite radius, on a possibly smaller basic open subset. Thus the presence/absence of local comeagreness cannot depend on which radius-≤R vertex plays the role of the root, whenever we restrict to a suitable subbasic open neighborhood.

Proposition 4 (meagreness is root-invariant for local-existential P)
Assume P is “local existential”: there exist r and a finite pattern H (with Δ(H)≤D) such that G has P iff G contains a copy of H. Then S_P is an \mathcal{F}_\sigma subset of X (S_P=\bigcup_{k\ge 0}A_k where A_k says “a copy of H appears at distance ≤k from the root,” hence open), and the meagreness status of S_P is root-invariant.
Proof. Each A_k is saturated under re-rooting by Lemma 3 on subbasic open sets, and meagreness of \bigcup_k A_k is determined by the meagreness of its pieces, which is preserved under the local re-rooting homeomorphisms. Hence the status is independent of which vertex is singled out as the root.

Discussion and obstacles for the general meagreness case
- For arbitrary (possibly highly nonlocal) P, S_P need not be Borel of simple rank; meagreness is subtler than nowhere denseness. Lemma 3 nevertheless shows that re-rooting is implementable as a homeomorphism on arbitrarily small basic neighborhoods. This implies: a saturated set S is meagre (resp. nonmeagre) on a basic neighborhood iff its re-rooted counterpart is meagre (resp. nonmeagre) on the re-rooted basic neighborhood. What is missing for a complete proof is a canonical way to patch these local equivalences into a global statement without assuming that such re-rootable neighborhoods form a countable open cover of X (they do not necessarily cover X, since we cannot force markers into a fixed point’s ball).
- A promising route: work with the comeagre set of points admitting infinitely many radii at which their r-balls are “marker-ready” (i.e., rigid enough to admit a unique coded beacon within one more step). It is standard in similar inverse limit spaces that such points form a dense G_δ (one can refine radii where the boundary has degree slack and exploit rigidity of finite trees). On this comeagre set Y, one expects to define a countable family of partial re-rooting homeomorphisms whose domains partition Y; then invariance of meagreness on Y follows. Because removing a meagre set from the ambient space does not affect meagreness of a subset, this would settle the general case.

Examples and sanity checks
- P = “has a 2-way infinite bridge.” By Theorem 16 in the provided abstract, S_P is meagre but not nowhere dense. Our arguments are consistent: the nowhere-dense part is root-invariant; the meagre status is stable under local re-rootings by the discussion above.
- P = “is bridgeless.” By Theorem 14, S_P is nowhere dense (in the regimes stated), hence root-invariant by Proposition 2.

Summary of progress
- Proved root-invariance for nowhere denseness (Proposition 2) for all unrooted properties P, via a basis-level characterization that does not depend on how the root is chosen.
- Established a robust local re-rooting homeomorphism (Lemma 3) and used it to prove meagreness root-invariance for all local-existential properties (Proposition 4), and to reduce the general meagreness case to constructing a comeagre domain partitioned by re-rootable basic opens. This gives a concrete, testable plan for the verifier to either complete the proof or seek a counterexample by violating the existence of such a comeagre partition.

Next steps
- Formalize and prove the “comeagre marker-ready set” existence and its partition by domains of partial re-rooting homeomorphisms. Then conclude full root-invariance for meagreness.
- Alternatively, search for a counterexample by constructing a nonlocal P whose S_P exhibits local nonmeagreness on some basic open sets but not on their re-rooted counterparts; Lemma 3 suggests this is unlikely, but a precise obstruction would be valuable.

### Typical properties of countable graphs: flows and bridges  
*(Extended abstract)*  

**Robert Šámal**\* · **Hadi Zamani**\*

#### Abstract
We have two aims. **First**, we study nowhere‑zero flows in countably infinite graphs, observing the different roles of two types of bridges. **Second**, we study how typical graphs with these types of bridges are. As there is no natural probability measure to use, we turn to an analytic approach: we study which sets are nowhere dense and which are meagre.

In finite graphs, bridges play a crucial role—it is easy to see that every flow assigns value \(0\) to every bridge. It is also known that graphs with a bridge are not typical: both dense random graphs and random regular graphs are bridgeless w.h.p. [3, 1]. We ask how this transfers to countable graphs. In Section 1 we explain differences between bridges and flows and, via compactness, we prove a version of Seymour’s 6‑flow theorem for countable graphs.

In Section 2 we explore nowhere‑dense and meagre sets. This is called for because the usual probabilistic models collapse: extending Erdős–Rényi to countably infinite graphs yields the Rado graph a.s., so we are effectively studying a single graph up to isomorphism. Attempting random regular graphs via the configuration model [1] would require a uniform distribution on perfect matchings of a countable set (e.g., neighbors of the first vertex), which does not exist. Consequently, we turn to Baire category: meagre/co‑meagre sets (also “first/second category”).

### 1. Nowhere‑zero flows for infinite graphs

**Definition 1 (weak flow).**  
Given an orientation \(D\) of a graph \(G\) and an abelian group \(A\), a **weak \(A\)‑flow** is a function \(\varphi:E(G)\to A\) such that **Kirchhoff’s law for each vertex cut** holds:
\[
\forall v\in V(G):\quad \sum_{e\in \delta^-(v)}\varphi(e)=\sum_{e\in \delta^+(v)}\varphi(e).
\]

**Definition 2 (strong flow).**  
Given \(D,G,A\) as above, a **strong \(A\)‑flow** is a function \(\varphi:E(G)\to A\) such that **Kirchhoff’s law for each cut** holds:
\[
\forall S\subseteq V(G):\quad \sum_{e\in \delta^+(S)}\varphi(e)=\sum_{e\in \delta^-(S)}\varphi(e).
\]

In either case, \(\varphi\) is a **nowhere‑zero** weak/strong \(A\)‑flow if \(\varphi^{-1}(0)=\varnothing\).

**Definition 3 (bridge).**  
An edge \(e\) of \(G\) is a **bridge** if deleting \(e\) increases the number of connected components. A bridge is **2‑way infinite** if both resulting components are infinite, and **1‑way infinite** otherwise.

Every strong flow is a weak flow. While the two notions are equivalent on finite graphs, they diverge on infinite graphs: e.g., on a two‑way infinite path, a nowhere‑zero weak \(A\)‑flow exists but a strong one does not. In [6] the authors construct a 3‑connected graph with two ends that admits a nowhere‑zero weak \(A\)‑flow but no nowhere‑zero strong \(A\)‑flow. Nearly all finite flow theorems extend to infinite **strong** \(A\)‑flows via topological compactness; here we use **logical** compactness to obtain:

**Theorem 4.**  
*A countably infinite, locally finite graph without a 1‑way infinite bridge has a nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow.*

### 2. Metric space of rooted connected graphs

Since no good probability measure exists for countable graphs, we study typicality via a metric topology and Baire category.

**Definition 5 (ε‑neighborhood).**  
For a metric space \((X,d)\) and \(x\in X\), the ε‑neighborhood is \(U_\varepsilon(x)=\{y\in X:\ d(x,y)<\varepsilon\}\). The closed neighborhood \(\overline{U}_\varepsilon(x)\) uses \(d(x,y)\le \varepsilon\).

**Definition 6 (open set).**  
A set \(U\subseteq X\) is open if \(\forall x\in U\ \exists \varepsilon>0:\ U_\varepsilon(x)\subseteq U\).

We now fix the graph space and metric.

**Definition 9 (space of rooted graphs).**  
Let \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) be the set of all connected rooted graphs (up to root‑preserving isomorphism). For \(D>2\), let \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) be those with all degrees \(\le D\), and \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) those with all degrees \(=D\).

**Definition 10 (r‑ball).**  
For \((G,v)\), the rooted r‑ball is
\[
B_r(G,v)=(\,G[\{y\in V(G): d(v,y)\le r\}],\,v\,).
\]

**Definition 11 (metric \(d_\bullet\)).**  
For \((G_1,v_1),(G_2,v_2)\in\mathbf{G}_\bullet\),
\[
d_\bullet\big((G_1,v_1),(G_2,v_2)\big)=\inf\{2^{-r} : B_r(G_1,v_1)\cong B_r(G_2,v_2)\}.
\]
This is a metric [5].

**Definition 12 (extensions of an r‑ball).**  
For an r‑ball \(F=B_r(G,v)\), define
\[
\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F=\{(G',v')\in \mathbf{G}_\bullet : B_r(G',v')\cong F\}.
\]

**Lemma 13 (basic facts in \((\mathbf{G}_\bullet,d_\bullet)\)).**  
- For each \((G,x)\), \(r\in\mathbb{N}\), and \(0<\varepsilon<1\):
  \[
  U_{2^{-r}+\varepsilon}((G,x))=U_{2^{-r}}((G,x))=\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{B_r(G,x)}.
  \]
- \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F\) is nonempty if \(F\) is an r‑ball in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) that contains a vertex of degree \< \(D\) at distance \(r\) from the root.
- A subset \(S\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) is nowhere dense iff
  \(\forall\) r‑balls \(F\ \exists\) r′‑ball \(F'\) with \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F'}\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F}\setminus S\).
- For all \(D>2\), \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) is not meagre.

### Main results on typical properties

**Theorem 14.**  
*The set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense (i) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) for all \(D>2\); and (ii) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) for all odd \(D>2\).*  
In D‑regular graphs with even \(D\), 1‑way infinite bridges cannot exist; instead we obtain:

**Theorem 15.**  
*The set of graphs without a cut vertex is nowhere dense in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

**Theorem 16.**  
*The set of graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge is meagre (but not nowhere dense) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

We also considered other (a)typical properties:

**Theorem 17.**  
*The set of graphs with edge‑chromatic number \(D\) is nowhere dense in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

### 3. Proof sketches

**Proof of Theorem 4 (sketch).**  
Let the vertices of \(G\) be \(v_1,v_2,\ldots\) and orient each edge \(\{v_i,v_j\}\) from the smaller to the larger index. For each radius \(r\), augment the r‑ball \(B_r(G,v_1)\) to a finite multigraph \(G_r\) by adding a sink vertex \(v_\infty\) and connecting boundary edges to \(v_\infty\). Introduce Boolean variables \(F_{e,1},\dots,F_{e,6}\) encoding which of six nonzero values an edge \(e\) receives, enforce exclusivity \(\bigvee_i F_{e,i}\) and \(\bigwedge_{j\ne i}\neg F_{e,j}\), and write linear parity constraints at each vertex (Kirchhoff’s law). Let \(F_{G_r}\) be the conjunction over vertices of \(G_r\); then every finite subset of the constraint family \(\{F_{G_r}\}_r\cup\{F_{e,i}\}_e\) is satisfiable (by [7]), hence by compactness [4] the whole set is satisfiable, yielding a nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow on \(G\).

**Proof idea for Theorem 14.**  
Given an r‑ball \(F\), construct an r′‑ball \(F'\) such that every extension of \(F'\) contains a bridge. For \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\), attach a leaf to a boundary vertex of degree \<\(D\). For \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) handle regularity via parity gadgets: define \(S(F)=\sum_{v\in L_r}(D-\deg v)\) where \(L_r\) is the boundary; use \(K_{D+1}-e\) gadgets and tree‑like expansions to force parity \(S(F)=1\), then attach a new vertex to create a bridge. Hence the bridgeless set is nowhere dense.

**Proof idea for Theorem 15.**  
In even \(D\)‑regular graphs, use gadgets to force a cut vertex; in odd \(D\) or degree‑bounded spaces, this also follows from the previous construction.

**Proof idea for Theorem 16.**  
Being “there is a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance \(k\)” is nowhere dense; take a union over \(k\in\mathbb{N}\) to get a meagre (but not nowhere‑dense) set.

**Proof idea for Theorem 17.**  
For each \(D\), there exist \(D\)‑regular graphs with \(\chi'(G)=D+1\) (even \(D\): complete graphs or any odd‑order \(D\)‑regular graph; odd \(D\): by Tutte’s theorem). Removing an edge preserves \(\chi'=D+1\) by parity. Embed parity gadgets within r‑balls so that every extension has edge‑chromatic number \(D+1\), hence the set is nowhere dense.

### 4. Future work (the conjectures)

**Question 18.** *Is the fact that a property is nowhere dense or meagre independent of the root?*  
A change of root gives one type of change of metric; however, many metrics on the space of countable graphs are possible.

**Question 19.** *Is there another metric on \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) where typical properties are different?*  
For instance, is there a metric in which **bridgeless graphs are typical**?

We also aim to investigate additional (a)typical properties in the spirit of Theorem 17.
