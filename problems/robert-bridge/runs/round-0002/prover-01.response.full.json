The phrase \u201cdoes not depend on the choice of the root \u03c1\u201d is ambiguous: S_P itself already ignores \u03c1. The only place \u03c1 matters is the topology on rooted graphs. A precise way to compare rooted vs unrooted viewpoints is via a quotient from rooted to unrooted spaces.\\n- I propose to introduce the unrooted quotient space U_q as the quotient of R = G_{\u2022,D} by the equivalence relation \u201csame underlying unrooted graph.\u201d Let \u03c0: R \u2192 U_q be the canonical surjection, and endow U_q with the quotient topology (W\u2286U_q open iff \u03c0^{-1}(W) is open in R). For a property P of unrooted graphs, write T_P\u2286U_q for the set of unrooted graphs with P; then S_P = \u03c0^{-1}(T_P).\\n- With this set\u2011up one can give clean, rigorous equivalences for nowhere\u2011denseness and (under mild definability) meagreness. This addresses Conjecture 18 precisely and separates it from choices of alternative unrooted metrics.\\n\\nRigorous statements and proofs\\nLemma 1 (cylinders are clopen; characterization of nowhere dense). For an r\u2011ball F, the cylinder C(F):=G_{\u2022}^{F} is clopen in R. A set S\u2286R is nowhere dense iff for every r\u2011ball F there exists an r\u2032\u2011ball F\u2032 with C(F\u2032)\u2286C(F)\\\\S. Proof: Standard ultrametric arguments; the basis of clopen cylinders yields the criterion.\\n\\nLemma 2 (nonemptiness of cylinders in \u0394\u2264D; necessity). Let F be an r\u2011ball (connected). If every vertex u with dist(u,root)=r has deg_F(u)=D, then C(F) contains no infinite connected extensions with \u0394\u2264D (hence C(F)\u2229G_{\u2022,\u2264D}^\u221e=\u2205). Conversely, if some boundary vertex has deg_F(u)<D, there exists an infinite connected extension with \u0394\u2264D. Proof: Necessity: if all boundary vertices are saturated in F, no edge can leave F without violating \u0394\u2264D, so any extension remains inside F, hence finite. Sufficiency: attach to some boundary vertex with spare degree an infinite (D\u2212deg_F(u))\u2011regular tree and complete degrees \u2264D elsewhere inductively to maintain connectedness.\\n\\nTheorem A (root\u2011invariance for nowhere dense via quotient). Let P be any property of unrooted graphs, T_P\u2286U_q the corresponding set, and S_P=\u03c0^{-1}(T_P). Then S_P is nowhere dense in R \u21d4 T_P is nowhere dense in U_q. Proof: \u201c\u21d2\u201d: Fix nonempty open W\u2286U_q. By quotient definition, \u03c0^{-1}(W) is nonempty open in R. Since S_P is nowhere dense, by Lemma 1 there exists a cylinder C\u2032\u2286\u03c0^{-1}(W) with C\u2032\u2229S_P=\u2205. Then W\u2032:=\u03c0(C\u2032) is open in U_q (by definition) with W\u2032\u2286W and W\u2032\u2229T_P=\u2205 because S_P=\u03c0^{-1}(T_P) and S_P is saturated: if G\u2208\u03c0(C\u2032) and G\u2208T_P, then every rooting of G would lie in S_P, contradicting C\u2032\u2229S_P=\u2205. \u201c\u21d0\u201d: Conversely, take a nonempty cylinder C. Then O:=\u03c0(C) is open in U_q. Since T_P is nowhere dense, there is nonempty open W\u2286O with W\u2229T_P=\u2205. Then C\u2032:=C\u2229\u03c0^{-1}(W) is a nonempty open subcylinder of C disjoint from S_P, proving S_P nowhere dense.\\n\\nRemark: Theorem A gives a clean, unconditional resolution for \u201croot\u2011invariance\u201d of nowhere denseness under the quotient topology induced from R. No metric on U_q is needed for this equivalence.\\n\\nTheorem B (meagreness under Baire property). Assume T_P has the Baire property in U_q (e.g., T_P is Borel/analytic). Then S_P is meagre in R \u21d4 T_P is meagre in U_q. Proof: \u201c\u21d0\u201d is immediate because \u03c0^{-1} preserves meagreness: write T_P=\u22c3_n N_n with N_n nowhere dense in U_q; then by Theorem A each \u03c0^{-1}(N_n) is nowhere dense in R, and S_P=\u22c3_n \u03c0^{-1}(N_n). For \u201c\u21d2\u201d, suppose S_P is meagre but T_P is not. Since T_P has the Baire property, there exists a nonempty open W\u2286U_q with T_P comeagre in W. Then \u03c0^{-1}(W) is nonempty open in R and S_P\u2229\u03c0^{-1}(W)=\u03c0^{-1}(T_P\u2229W) is comeagre in \u03c0^{-1}(W), contradicting meagreness of S_P.\\n\\nCounterexample: why the na\u00efve unrooted local metric d_\u2218 breaks openness\\n- If one instead defines U by the metric d_\u2218(G,H)=2^{-R} with R the largest r for which there exist vertices x,y with B_r(G,x)\u2245B_r(H,y), then the images \u03c0(C(F))={G: \u2203x, B_r(G,x)\u2245F} need not be open in (U,d_\u2218). Indeed, fix G containing two distinct r\u2011ball types F and F\u2032. Modify G near a vertex realizing F to a graph H where that copy of F disappears, keeping intact a vertex whose r\u2011ball is F\u2032. Then d_\u2218(G,H)\u22642^{-r} but H\u2209\u03c0(C(F)). Hence these \u201ccontains F somewhere\u201d sets are not open in d_\u2218, and \u03c0 is not open onto (U,d_\u2218). Conclusion: proofs relying on \u03c0 being open onto d_\u2218 are invalid; the correct framework is the quotient topology U_q.\\n\\nTargeted issues and suggested fixes in the current writeup\\n1) Clarify Conjecture 18. Recommend: \u201cLet P be a (Borel) property of unrooted graphs. With U_q the quotient of G_{\u2022,D} by forgetting the root, S_P is nowhere dense (resp. meagre) in G_{\u2022,D} iff T_P is nowhere dense (resp. meagre) in U_q.\u201d Provide Theorems A and B with proofs.\\n\\n2) Lemma 13 (nonemptiness). Strengthen and prove necessity: for \u0394\u2264D and infinite connected extensions, a cylinder C(F) is nonempty iff some boundary vertex has spare degree in F (Lemma 2). This lemma is used repeatedly to justify local modifications (e.g., adding a leaf) and ensures the refinement step is legitimate.\\n\\n3) Theorem 14 (bridgeless nowhere dense). For \u0394\u2264D, the \u201cattach a leaf\u201d refinement is valid given Lemma 2 (it creates a 1\u2011way infinite bridge). For \u0394= D odd, the parity gadget sketch is too vague: you must present an explicit finite r\u2032\u2011ball F\u2032 that (i) admits D\u2011regular completions and (ii) forces a bridge in every completion. Suggest: construct a finite core H with exactly one boundary vertex x having one free stub, saturate all other boundary degrees to D within F\u2032, and argue every D\u2011regular completion must use exactly one external edge at x; prove that edge is a bridge. Provide full degree bookkeeping and a completion lemma guaranteeing nonemptiness.\\n\\n4) Theorem 15 (cut vertices in even D). Since no 1\u2011edge cuts exist in D\u2011regular graphs with even D (parity), explain why the bridge approach is irrelevant here and give an explicit gadget that forces a cut vertex in every completion. Again, include the completion lemma and degree checks.\\n\\n5) Theorem 16 (2\u2011way infinite bridges meagre but not nowhere dense). Correct the scope: in \u0394= D even, the set is empty (hence meagre and also nowhere dense). State the theorem separately for \u0394\u2264D and for \u0394= D odd. Provide full proof: (i) For each k, the set B_k \u201cthere is a 2\u2011way infinite bridge whose midpoint has distance \u2264k from the root\u201d is nowhere dense by locally adding cycles to all edges within distance \u2264k in a subcylinder. (ii) Density (hence not nowhere dense): given any cylinder, complete it to an infinite graph and, far beyond the specified ball, attach two disjoint infinite rays and connect them by a single edge; this creates a 2\u2011way infinite bridge while preserving \u0394\u2264D (or \u0394= D odd via parity gadgets). Conclude meagreness as \u22c3_k B_k.\\n\\n6) Theorem 17 (\u03c7\u2032=D nowhere dense). Provide an explicit class\u20112 \u0394\u2264D finite subgraph H embedded in an r\u2032\u2011ball (even D: K_{D+1}; odd D: cite a concrete class\u20112 D\u2011regular graph, e.g., by Petersen for D=3 and known constructions for general odd D). Saturate boundary degrees to \u2264D so any completion contains H as a subgraph; hence \u03c7\u2032\u2265D+1 in every completion. This rigor replaces \u201cparity gadgets\u201d wording.\\n\\n7) Theorem 4 (weak 6\u2011flows via compactness). The finite satisfiability step needs clarification: the augmented finite graphs G_r may have bridges, so invoking Seymour\u2019s 6\u2011flow theorem for bridgeless graphs is not directly applicable. Specify precisely which finite theorem you use to certify satisfiability of the local constraints on each G_r, or adjust the augmentation (e.g., replace the sink by a large Eulerian buffer ensuring no cut\u2011edge is forced). Alternatively, cite a finite weak\u2011flow existence result tailored to your constraints.\\n\\nExamples and sanity checks\\n- Even D regular: no bridge can exist (|\u03b4(S)|\u2261D|S| mod 2). This must be reflected throughout (not only \u201c1\u2011way infinite bridges cannot exist\u201d). Adjust statements of Theorems 14\u201316 accordingly.\\n- Cylinder refinement for nowhere denseness: In \u0394\u2264D, starting from any nonempty cylinder, Lemma 2 guarantees at least one boundary spare stub, so attaching a leaf always yields a refinement forcing a bridge. This provides a simple, checkable dense\u2011open family witnessing nowhere denseness of \u201cbridgeless.\u201d\\n\\nObstacles\\n- Equating rooted and unrooted smallness via the popular unrooted local metric d_\u2218 fails (\u03c0 is not open onto (U,d_\u2218)). Use the quotient topology U_q instead. If you still wish to compare to (U,d_\u2218), an extra argument is required to interpolate between these topologies (e.g., show they have the same meagre/nowhere\u2011dense sets for saturated sets\u2014this seems false in general without further structure).\\n- Meagreness equivalence requires the Baire property for T_P to push \u201cnonmeagre\u201d to \u201ccomeagre on some open.\u201d Restrict to Borel/analytic properties to avoid pathologies.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Add a short section defining U_q and proving Theorems A and B (with Lemmas 1\u20132). This resolves Conjecture 18 precisely and rigorously.\\n- Flesh out explicit gadgets and completion lemmas for Theorems 14\u201317; fix the scope issues (\u0394\u2264D vs \u0394= D odd/even).\\n- Repair Theorem 4\u2019s finite satisfiability step with a correct finite result or a modified augmentation ensuring applicability.\\n- Provide citations for compactness/Baire facts: G_{\u2022,\u2264D} is compact; the subspace of infinite connected graphs is a G_\u03b4 (hence Polish/Baire), so the whole ambient spaces are not meagre.\\n\\nSummary extractable claim\\n- For any unrooted property P, S_P is nowhere dense in the rooted space R iff T_P is nowhere dense in the unrooted quotient U_q; and, assuming the Baire property for T_P, S_P is meagre in R iff T_P is meagre in U_q. This gives a precise, positive resolution of \u201croot\u2011invariance of smallness\u201d in the natural quotient sense and highlights where the current writeup needs concrete gadget constructions and scope corrections.\"}",
