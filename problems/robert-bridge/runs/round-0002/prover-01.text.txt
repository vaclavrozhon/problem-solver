Ideas: formalizing “root‑invariance of smallness” and auditing the writeup
- The set S_P = {(G,ρ): G has P} is saturated (closed under re‑rooting). The phrase “does not depend on the choice of the root ρ” is ambiguous: S_P itself already ignores ρ. The only place ρ matters is the topology on rooted graphs. A precise way to compare rooted vs unrooted viewpoints is via a quotient from rooted to unrooted spaces.
- I propose to introduce the unrooted quotient space U_q as the quotient of R = G_{•,D} by the equivalence relation “same underlying unrooted graph.” Let π: R → U_q be the canonical surjection, and endow U_q with the quotient topology (W⊆U_q open iff π^{-1}(W) is open in R). For a property P of unrooted graphs, write T_P⊆U_q for the set of unrooted graphs with P; then S_P = π^{-1}(T_P).
- With this set‑up one can give clean, rigorous equivalences for nowhere‑denseness and (under mild definability) meagreness. This addresses Conjecture 18 precisely and separates it from choices of alternative unrooted metrics.

Rigorous statements and proofs
Lemma 1 (cylinders are clopen; characterization of nowhere dense). For an r‑ball F, the cylinder C(F):=G_{•}^{F} is clopen in R. A set S⊆R is nowhere dense iff for every r‑ball F there exists an r′‑ball F′ with C(F′)⊆C(F)\S. Proof: Standard ultrametric arguments; the basis of clopen cylinders yields the criterion.

Lemma 2 (nonemptiness of cylinders in Δ≤D; necessity). Let F be an r‑ball (connected). If every vertex u with dist(u,root)=r has deg_F(u)=D, then C(F) contains no infinite connected extensions with Δ≤D (hence C(F)∩G_{•,≤D}^∞=∅). Conversely, if some boundary vertex has deg_F(u)<D, there exists an infinite connected extension with Δ≤D. Proof: Necessity: if all boundary vertices are saturated in F, no edge can leave F without violating Δ≤D, so any extension remains inside F, hence finite. Sufficiency: attach to some boundary vertex with spare degree an infinite (D−deg_F(u))‑regular tree and complete degrees ≤D elsewhere inductively to maintain connectedness.

Theorem A (root‑invariance for nowhere dense via quotient). Let P be any property of unrooted graphs, T_P⊆U_q the corresponding set, and S_P=π^{-1}(T_P). Then S_P is nowhere dense in R ⇔ T_P is nowhere dense in U_q. Proof: “⇒”: Fix nonempty open W⊆U_q. By quotient definition, π^{-1}(W) is nonempty open in R. Since S_P is nowhere dense, by Lemma 1 there exists a cylinder C′⊆π^{-1}(W) with C′∩S_P=∅. Then W′:=π(C′) is open in U_q (by definition) with W′⊆W and W′∩T_P=∅ because S_P=π^{-1}(T_P) and S_P is saturated: if G∈π(C′) and G∈T_P, then every rooting of G would lie in S_P, contradicting C′∩S_P=∅. “⇐”: Conversely, take a nonempty cylinder C. Then O:=π(C) is open in U_q. Since T_P is nowhere dense, there is nonempty open W⊆O with W∩T_P=∅. Then C′:=C∩π^{-1}(W) is a nonempty open subcylinder of C disjoint from S_P, proving S_P nowhere dense.

Remark: Theorem A gives a clean, unconditional resolution for “root‑invariance” of nowhere denseness under the quotient topology induced from R. No metric on U_q is needed for this equivalence.

Theorem B (meagreness under Baire property). Assume T_P has the Baire property in U_q (e.g., T_P is Borel/analytic). Then S_P is meagre in R ⇔ T_P is meagre in U_q. Proof: “⇐” is immediate because π^{-1} preserves meagreness: write T_P=⋃_n N_n with N_n nowhere dense in U_q; then by Theorem A each π^{-1}(N_n) is nowhere dense in R, and S_P=⋃_n π^{-1}(N_n). For “⇒”, suppose S_P is meagre but T_P is not. Since T_P has the Baire property, there exists a nonempty open W⊆U_q with T_P comeagre in W. Then π^{-1}(W) is nonempty open in R and S_P∩π^{-1}(W)=π^{-1}(T_P∩W) is comeagre in π^{-1}(W), contradicting meagreness of S_P.

Counterexample: why the naïve unrooted local metric d_∘ breaks openness
- If one instead defines U by the metric d_∘(G,H)=2^{-R} with R the largest r for which there exist vertices x,y with B_r(G,x)≅B_r(H,y), then the images π(C(F))={G: ∃x, B_r(G,x)≅F} need not be open in (U,d_∘). Indeed, fix G containing two distinct r‑ball types F and F′. Modify G near a vertex realizing F to a graph H where that copy of F disappears, keeping intact a vertex whose r‑ball is F′. Then d_∘(G,H)≤2^{-r} but H∉π(C(F)). Hence these “contains F somewhere” sets are not open in d_∘, and π is not open onto (U,d_∘). Conclusion: proofs relying on π being open onto d_∘ are invalid; the correct framework is the quotient topology U_q.

Targeted issues and suggested fixes in the current writeup
1) Clarify Conjecture 18. Recommend: “Let P be a (Borel) property of unrooted graphs. With U_q the quotient of G_{•,D} by forgetting the root, S_P is nowhere dense (resp. meagre) in G_{•,D} iff T_P is nowhere dense (resp. meagre) in U_q.” Provide Theorems A and B with proofs.

2) Lemma 13 (nonemptiness). Strengthen and prove necessity: for Δ≤D and infinite connected extensions, a cylinder C(F) is nonempty iff some boundary vertex has spare degree in F (Lemma 2). This lemma is used repeatedly to justify local modifications (e.g., adding a leaf) and ensures the refinement step is legitimate.

3) Theorem 14 (bridgeless nowhere dense). For Δ≤D, the “attach a leaf” refinement is valid given Lemma 2 (it creates a 1‑way infinite bridge). For Δ= D odd, the parity gadget sketch is too vague: you must present an explicit finite r′‑ball F′ that (i) admits D‑regular completions and (ii) forces a bridge in every completion. Suggest: construct a finite core H with exactly one boundary vertex x having one free stub, saturate all other boundary degrees to D within F′, and argue every D‑regular completion must use exactly one external edge at x; prove that edge is a bridge. Provide full degree bookkeeping and a completion lemma guaranteeing nonemptiness.

4) Theorem 15 (cut vertices in even D). Since no 1‑edge cuts exist in D‑regular graphs with even D (parity), explain why the bridge approach is irrelevant here and give an explicit gadget that forces a cut vertex in every completion. Again, include the completion lemma and degree checks.

5) Theorem 16 (2‑way infinite bridges meagre but not nowhere dense). Correct the scope: in Δ= D even, the set is empty (hence meagre and also nowhere dense). State the theorem separately for Δ≤D and for Δ= D odd. Provide full proof: (i) For each k, the set B_k “there is a 2‑way infinite bridge whose midpoint has distance ≤k from the root” is nowhere dense by locally adding cycles to all edges within distance ≤k in a subcylinder. (ii) Density (hence not nowhere dense): given any cylinder, complete it to an infinite graph and, far beyond the specified ball, attach two disjoint infinite rays and connect them by a single edge; this creates a 2‑way infinite bridge while preserving Δ≤D (or Δ= D odd via parity gadgets). Conclude meagreness as ⋃_k B_k.

6) Theorem 17 (χ′=D nowhere dense). Provide an explicit class‑2 Δ≤D finite subgraph H embedded in an r′‑ball (even D: K_{D+1}; odd D: cite a concrete class‑2 D‑regular graph, e.g., by Petersen for D=3 and known constructions for general odd D). Saturate boundary degrees to ≤D so any completion contains H as a subgraph; hence χ′≥D+1 in every completion. This rigor replaces “parity gadgets” wording.

7) Theorem 4 (weak 6‑flows via compactness). The finite satisfiability step needs clarification: the augmented finite graphs G_r may have bridges, so invoking Seymour’s 6‑flow theorem for bridgeless graphs is not directly applicable. Specify precisely which finite theorem you use to certify satisfiability of the local constraints on each G_r, or adjust the augmentation (e.g., replace the sink by a large Eulerian buffer ensuring no cut‑edge is forced). Alternatively, cite a finite weak‑flow existence result tailored to your constraints.

Examples and sanity checks
- Even D regular: no bridge can exist (|δ(S)|≡D|S| mod 2). This must be reflected throughout (not only “1‑way infinite bridges cannot exist”). Adjust statements of Theorems 14–16 accordingly.
- Cylinder refinement for nowhere denseness: In Δ≤D, starting from any nonempty cylinder, Lemma 2 guarantees at least one boundary spare stub, so attaching a leaf always yields a refinement forcing a bridge. This provides a simple, checkable dense‑open family witnessing nowhere denseness of “bridgeless.”

Obstacles
- Equating rooted and unrooted smallness via the popular unrooted local metric d_∘ fails (π is not open onto (U,d_∘)). Use the quotient topology U_q instead. If you still wish to compare to (U,d_∘), an extra argument is required to interpolate between these topologies (e.g., show they have the same meagre/nowhere‑dense sets for saturated sets—this seems false in general without further structure).
- Meagreness equivalence requires the Baire property for T_P to push “nonmeagre” to “comeagre on some open.” Restrict to Borel/analytic properties to avoid pathologies.

Next steps
- Add a short section defining U_q and proving Theorems A and B (with Lemmas 1–2). This resolves Conjecture 18 precisely and rigorously.
- Flesh out explicit gadgets and completion lemmas for Theorems 14–17; fix the scope issues (Δ≤D vs Δ= D odd/even).
- Repair Theorem 4’s finite satisfiability step with a correct finite result or a modified augmentation ensuring applicability.
- Provide citations for compactness/Baire facts: G_{•,≤D} is compact; the subspace of infinite connected graphs is a G_δ (hence Polish/Baire), so the whole ambient spaces are not meagre.

Summary extractable claim
- For any unrooted property P, S_P is nowhere dense in the rooted space R iff T_P is nowhere dense in the unrooted quotient U_q; and, assuming the Baire property for T_P, S_P is meagre in R iff T_P is meagre in U_q. This gives a precise, positive resolution of “root‑invariance of smallness” in the natural quotient sense and highlights where the current writeup needs concrete gadget constructions and scope corrections.
