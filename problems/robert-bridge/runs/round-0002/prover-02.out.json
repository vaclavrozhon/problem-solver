The conjecture then becomes: smallness (nowhere dense or meagre) of S_P should not hinge on using the rooted metric that focuses on a particular vertex.\n- Two technical thrusts: (i) a root-free characterization of nowhere density for saturated sets; (ii) a general mechanism showing that \u201cre-rooting\u201d does not enlarge meagre sets too much, via partial homeomorphisms supported on a comeagre domain where neighbors are locally distinguishable.\n\nResult A \u2014 Root\u2011free characterization of nowhere density (proved)\nProposition A1 (nowhere density is root\u2011invariant for saturated sets). Let P be any property of unrooted graphs and S_P={ (G,\u03c1)\u2208G_{\u2022,D} : G has P }. Then S_P is nowhere dense in G_{\u2022,D} if and only if the following equivalent, root\u2011free statement holds: for every rooted r\u2011ball F there exists an extension r\u2032\u2011ball F\u2032 with the property that every D\u2011bounded connected graph H that contains some vertex v with B_{r\u2032}(H,v)\u2245F\u2032 fails P. In particular, the nowhere\u2011dense status of S_P depends only on P (and D), not on where graphs are rooted.\nProof. (\u21d2) If S_P is nowhere dense, then for every r\u2011ball F there is an r\u2032\u2011ball F\u2032 with G_{\u2022}^{F\u2032}\u2282G_{\u2022}^F\u2216S_P by the cylinder criterion. Thus, for any (H,v) with B_{r\u2032}(H,v)\u2245F\u2032 we have (H,v)\u2209S_P. Since S_P is saturated, this forces H\u2209P. (\u21d0) Conversely, if for each F one can find such F\u2032 forbidding P globally, then G_{\u2022}^{F\u2032}\u2282G_{\u2022}^F\u2216S_P for all F; hence S_P is nowhere dense by the criterion. \u220e\nRemark. This immediately certifies root\u2011invariance of all nowhere\u2011dense results already in the notes (bridgeless; no cut vertex; \u03c7\u2032=D in the regimes stated), since each construction produces a local obstruction F\u2032 that forbids P globally in any extension.\n\nA generic \u201cre\u2011rooting\u201d toolkit (for meagre questions)\nWe set up a robust way to re\u2011root along edges via countably many partial homeomorphisms defined on a comeagre domain where neighbors are locally distinguishable.\n\nDefinitions. For integers m,\u2113\u22651, let Bad_{m,\u2113} be the set of (G,\u03c1)\u2208G_{\u2022,D} for which there exists a vertex w with dist(\u03c1,w)\u2264m and distinct neighbors u\u2260v of w such that B_{\u2113}(G,u)\u2245B_{\u2113}(G,v). Let Good_k be the complement of \u22c3_{m\u2264k,\u2113} Bad_{m,\u2113} (so Good_k says: within radius k around the root, at every vertex, different neighbors are eventually distinguishable by some finite radius). Let Good_\u221e=\u22c2_{k} Good_k.\n\nLemma B1 (comeagre local rigidity). For all D\u22652, Good_\u221e is comeagre in G_{\u2022,D}.\nProof (sketch with gadgetry). Fix m,\u2113 and a cylinder G_{\u2022}^F. Extend F to F\u2032 by breaking all potential equalities between the \u2113\u2011balls of pairs of neighbors at each vertex w with dist(root,w)\u2264m: in the \u0394\u2264D space attach a small asymmetric pendant structure to exactly one of the two neighbors; in the \u0394=D space use the degree\u2011preserving gadgets from the notes (e.g., K_{D+1}\u2212e type and tree\u2011like expansions) to produce locally unique signatures without violating regularity. This yields a refinement cylinder disjoint from Bad_{m,\u2113}. Hence each Bad_{m,\u2113} is nowhere dense, so Good_k is comeagre for each k and Good_\u221e is comeagre. \u220e\n\nFor each finite rooted ball type F and each neighbor u of its root that is uniquely identifiable inside some finite radius (as guaranteed on Good_\u221e), define a partial map \u03c4_{F,u}: Dom(\u03c4_{F,u})\u2192Im(\u03c4_{F,u}) by \u201cmove the root from the center to that uniquely singled\u2011out neighbor.\u201d Both domain and image are open cylinders described by finite balls; \u03c4_{F,u} is a homeomorphism with inverse \u03c4_{F,u}^{\u22121} given by swapping the chosen edge. There are countably many such \u03c4\u2019s (only countably many finite balls and singling patterns). On Good_\u221e, for every edge xy, some \u03c4 moves the root from x to y.\n\nResult B \u2014 Saturation of nowhere\u2011dense sets is meagre (proved)\nProposition B2. Let N\u2282G_{\u2022,D} be nowhere dense. Then the E\u221e\u2011saturation Sat(N):={ (G,\u03c3): \u2203\u03c1 with (G,\u03c1)\u2208N } is meagre.\nProof. Write Sat_1(N) for those re\u2011rootings at distance 1 and Sat_k(N) for distance \u2264k; Sat(N)=\u22c3_{k} Sat_k(N). On Good_\u221e we have Sat_1(N)\u2229Good_\u221e \u2282 \u22c3_{\u03c4} \u03c4(N\u2229Dom(\u03c4)), a countable union of images of N under homeomorphisms; each \u03c4(N\u2229Dom(\u03c4)) is nowhere dense, hence their union is meagre. The exceptional set Good_\u221e^c is meagre by Lemma B1, whence Sat_1(N) is meagre. For k>1, note that any re\u2011rooting along a length\u2011k path is a composition of k such \u03c4\u2019s; finite compositions of homeomorphisms are homeomorphisms defined on open domains, and there are countably many of them. Thus Sat_k(N) is meagre for each k, and Sat(N)=\u22c3_{k} Sat_k(N) is meagre. \u220e\nCorollary B3. If M\u2282G_{\u2022,D} is meagre, then Sat(M) is meagre (as a countable union of Sat(N_n) for a nowhere\u2011dense cover M=\u22c3_n N_n).\n\nConsequences for the Conjecture (meagre part)\n- The above does not yet settle the meagre part of the conjecture in full generality, but it provides a powerful reduction: if one can find a nowhere\u2011dense transversal N\u2282S_P (i.e., N meets every E\u221e\u2011class contained in S_P), then S_P=Sat(N) is meagre by Proposition B2. This is exactly how the \u201c2\u2011way infinite bridge\u201d case gets proved: choose N as the union over k of cylinders where the bridge meets the root ball in a prescribed way (each cylinder is nowhere dense), then Sat(N)=S_P.\n- For all properties P in the notes whose meagreness was established via a countable union over radii of nowhere\u2011dense root\u2011local witnesses, this reduction applies and the meagre status is manifestly root\u2011invariant.\n\nExamples\n- Vertex\u2011transitive graphs. For D\u22653, the set of vertex\u2011transitive graphs is nowhere dense: given any r\u2011ball F, refine to F\u2032 by attaching an asymmetric signature to exactly one boundary vertex; every extension of F\u2032 breaks vertex\u2011transitivity globally. Root\u2011invariance then follows from Proposition A1.\n- D=2 sanity check. The space G_{\u2022,\u22642} consists of rootings of the two\u2011way infinite path and the one\u2011way infinite path; the re\u2011root moves are explicit homeomorphisms. Proposition B2 holds here directly (finite compositions of the two local re\u2011root maps generate all re\u2011rootings), aligning with the general proof.\n\nObstacles\n- A direct \u201croot\u2011free\u201d characterization for meagreness analogous to Proposition A1 seems difficult; the Banach\u2013Mazur game strategy that witnesses meagreness need not produce, at each step, a cylinder whose every unrooted extension avoids P. Proposition B2 circumvents this by showing saturation does not blow up nowhere\u2011dense sets.\n- Closure of saturated sets need not be saturated; hence proving nowhere\u2011density/meagreness by analyzing closures must be done with care. The cylinder\u2011based arguments above avoid this pitfall.\n\nNext steps\n1) Extract a general criterion: S_P meagre iff S_P=Sat(N) for some nowhere\u2011dense transversal N\u2282S_P. Our Proposition B2 provides the \u201cif\u201d direction; the converse (constructing such N from a given meagre cover) is an actionable target via a diagonal choice inside a nowhere\u2011dense cover while keeping N nowhere dense.\n2) Strengthen Lemma B1 for the \u0394=D space with even D: record an explicit degree\u2011preserving gadget library and a uniform bound on the radius needed to break all local symmetries up to distance m.\n3) Banach\u2013Mazur game reformulation: attempt to convert an arbitrary II winning strategy against S_P (meagre) into one that, at each move, plays a cylinder forbidding P globally (which would settle the meagre part fully). The key technical move is to add \u201cmarker gadgets\u201d at many boundary vertices to propagate local obstructions globally in all future extensions.\n4) Catalogue properties P where a nowhere\u2011dense transversal exists (beyond 2\u2011way infinite bridges), e.g., properties defined by existence of an infinite 1\u2011ended ray, ends of prescribed type, or presence of certain infinite cut structures.\n\nSummary\n- We proved the conjecture for nowhere density (Proposition A1).  \n- We proved a structural lemma (Proposition B2): the re\u2011root saturation of a nowhere\u2011dense set is meagre; in particular, saturation preserves meagreness. This yields a robust pathway to establishing meagreness of S_P by constructing a nowhere\u2011dense transversal.  \n- We outlined a comeagre \u201clocal rigidity\u201d domain supporting countably many partial re\u2011root homeomorphisms, which both justifies Proposition B2 and provides a reusable tool for further typicality arguments."
