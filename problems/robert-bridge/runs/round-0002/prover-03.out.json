  "content": "Critical review and actionable corrections\n\nIdeas\n- Tighten Section 2 (topology) by fixing off\u2011by\u2011one mistakes and clarifying the basic cylinders. Provide short, rigorous lemmas the verifier can drop into proofs.md.\n- Make explicit necessary/sufficient conditions for nonemptiness of cylinders in the degree\u2011constrained subspaces (\u2264D and =D).\n- Strengthen Theorems 14\u201317 with precise gadgets and parity arguments; point out a false claim in the proof sketch of Theorem 17 and replace it by a standard subgraph forcing argument.\n- Clarify and partially resolve the \u201croot\u2011invariance\u201d conjecture: for unrooted P, S_P is saturated; nowhere denseness is root\u2011invariant. Give a local re\u2011rooting homeomorphism lemma toward the meagre case.\n\nCorrections in the metric section (with proofs)\n1) Off\u2011by\u2011one in the equivalence and neighborhoods.\n- As stated, \u201cd_\\bullet((G,\u03c1),(H,\u03c3))<2^{-r} iff B_r(G,\u03c1)\u2245B_r(H,\u03c3)\u201d is false. With R=\\sup\\{s: B_s(G,\u03c1)\u2245B_s(H,\u03c3)\\} and d_\\bullet=2^{-R}, the correct equivalences are:\n  - B_r(G,\u03c1)\u2245B_r(H,\u03c3) iff d_\\bullet((G,\u03c1),(H,\u03c3))\u22642^{-r}.\n  - d_\\bullet((G,\u03c1),(H,\u03c3))<2^{-r} iff B_{r}(G,\u03c1)\u2245B_{r}(H,\u03c3) and, in fact, B_{r+1}(G,\u03c1)\u2245B_{r+1}(H,\u03c3).\n- Correct form of Lemma 13 (first bullet): for every (G,x), r\u2208\u2115 and every \u03b5 with 0<\u03b5\u22642^{-(r+1)},\n  U_{2^{-r}+\u03b5}((G,x))=\\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^{B_r(G,x)}.\n  Proof: If B_r agrees, R\u2265r, so d\u22642^{-r}<2^{-r}+\u03b5. Conversely, if d<2^{-r}+\u03b5\u22642^{-r}+2^{-(r+1)}<2^{-r+1}, then d=2^{-q} with q\u2265r, hence B_r agrees.\n- Cylinder sets \\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^{F} are clopen. Openness follows from the display above; closedness because their complements are unions of (finitely many) cylinders at radius r that disagree with F.\n\n2) Nonemptiness of cylinders under degree constraints.\n- In \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,\\le D}: Let F be an r\u2011ball. Then \\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^{F}\u2229\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,\\le D}\u2260\u2205 iff there exists a vertex at distance exactly r from the root with deg_F(v)<D. Necessity: otherwise any extension must be finite. Sufficiency: attach an infinite (\u2264D) tree beyond a boundary vertex of deficit without altering B_r.\n- In \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,=D}: \\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^{F}\u2229\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,=D}\u2260\u2205 iff (i) every vertex at distance <r has deg_F(v)=D; and (ii) at least one vertex at distance r has deg_F(v)<D. Necessity: adding edges to vertices at distance <r would change B_r; without a boundary deficit, any extension is finite. Sufficiency: attach disjoint infinite D\u2011regular trees to each boundary stub.\n\nNowhere density characterization (fixing Lemma 13)\n- Correct criterion: S\u2286X is nowhere dense iff \u2200 r\u2011balls F with \\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^{F}\u2260\u2205 \u2203 r\u2032 and F\u2032 extending F such that \\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^{F\u2032}\u2286\\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^{F}\\setminus\\overline{S}. The version stated with \u201c\\setminus S\u201d is too strong in general.\n\nRemarks on Baire property\n- \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,\\le D} is compact (standard; Aldous\u2013Lyons). \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,=D} is closed in \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,\\le D} (degree equal to D is local across all radii in a connected graph), hence compact. Thus both are Baire, so \u201cnot meagre\u201d is automatic. This deserves an explicit reference and/or proof.\n\nCritique and repairs of Theorems 14\u201317\n- Theorem 14 (\u2264D): The \u201cattach a leaf\u201d argument is sound: a pendant edge remains a bridge in any extension respecting \u2264D. Add: argue that the leaf\u2019s degree stays 1 and thus that edge is a bridge.\n- Theorem 14 (=D, odd D): The parity gadget discussion is vague. A clean construction: Given a cylinder \\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^{F}, extend to F\u2032 so that every vertex at distance r\u2032\u22121 has degree D and all but exactly one boundary vertex at distance r\u2032 have degree D, the remaining one has degree D\u22121. In any D\u2011regular extension, exactly one external edge must attach at that boundary vertex. Removing it separates the finite ball from the infinite complement, i.e., a 1\u2011way infinite bridge. Parity enforces odd D (since D|V(B_{r\u2032})|\u22122|E(B_{r\u2032})|=1 must hold). This should replace the parity gadget paragraph.\n- Even D: the same \u201cone external edge\u201d construction is impossible by parity; hence Theorem 15 becomes the right substitute. But the proof idea for Theorem 15 still needs a concrete gadget ensuring a cut vertex in all extensions in the even\u2011regular case; e.g., enforce a vertex whose D incident edges are partitioned into two internally saturated blocks within the ball, leaving two disjoint \u201cthrough\u2011ports\u201d whose continuation must go to different infinite parts, making that vertex a cut vertex. Details and parity checks are needed.\n- Theorem 16: The sketch \u201cdistance k\u201d \u21d2 nowhere dense is plausible but incomplete. One needs: For fixed k, given any cylinder \\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^{F}, refine to \\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^{F\u2032} such that within distance \u2264k of the root, every potential candidate edge e lies in a cycle in any extension (kill 2\u2011way infinite bridges locally by forcing a bypass). Conversely, show density by explicitly extending F to contain a \u201cdumbbell\u201d consisting of two infinite trees connected by one edge well beyond r. Both directions should be written.\n- Theorem 17: The claim \u201cremoving an edge preserves \u03c7\u2032=D+1 by parity\u201d is false (e.g., K_3\u2212e has \u03c7\u2032=2). A correct route: Fix a finite D\u2011regular class\u20112 graph H (exists for all D\u22653; e.g., odd complete graph for even D, snarks/Tashkinov constructions for odd D). For any cylinder, refine to embed H as a subgraph inside the ball (degrees inside the ball \u2264D), then any extension has \u03c7\u2032\u2265\u03c7\u2032(H)=D+1. Hence the class\u20111 set is nowhere dense. This removes the incorrect parity sentence.\n\nRoot\u2011invariance: what is true now\n- Clarify: For unrooted P, S_P is saturated (closed under re\u2011rooting). For saturated S, both \\overline{S} and Int(\\overline{S}) are saturated.\n\nLemma A (closure and interior are saturated)\nIf S is saturated, then for any (G,\u03c1)\u2208\\overline{S} and any vertex u, (G,u)\u2208\\overline{S}. Proof: For each r choose (H_r,\u03c3_r)\u2208S with B_r(H_r,\u03c3_r)\u2245B_r(G,\u03c1). Transport the root along the isomorphism to the image of u (when u is within distance r; otherwise increase r). Since S is saturated, the re\u2011rooted (H_r,\u03c3_r\u2032)\u2208S and B_r(H_r,\u03c3_r\u2032)\u2245B_r(G,u). Hence (G,u)\u2208\\overline{S}. Interior is then saturated because Int(\\overline{S}) is a union of cylinders, and re\u2011rooting permutes cylinders.\n\nCorollary B (root\u2011invariance for nowhere density)\nFor any unrooted property P, whether S_P is nowhere dense in \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,D} does not depend on the root. Proof: S_P is saturated, and nowhere denseness is \u201cInt(\\overline{S_P})=\u2205\u201d, which by Lemma A is invariant under re\u2011rooting.\n\nToward meagreness: a local re\u2011rooting homeomorphism\nLemma C (marker\u2011based local re\u2011rooting)\nGiven an r\u2011ball F and a vertex u of F, there is an extension F_mark on radius r\u2032\u2265r and a clopen cylinder U=\\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^{F_\\mathrm{mark}} and a clopen V=\\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^{F_\\mathrm{mark}[u]} such that the map that re\u2011roots at the marked copy of u is a homeomorphism U\u2192V. Construction: extend along the geodesic from root to u and attach a rigid tree beacon at a boundary vertex of that geodesic; uniqueness of the beacon pins down u. In \u2264D the beacon uses spare degree; in =D, first locally saturate degrees then reserve one stub for the beacon (odd D is easy; even D needs a different cut\u2011vertex gadget). This supports local invariance of meagreness under re\u2011rooting on dense families of cylinders.\n\nExamples\n- D=2: verify even\u2011regular parity barrier for 1\u2011way bridges; removing a vertex in the bi\u2011infinite path shows cut vertices exist, supporting Theorem 15\u2019s even\u2011regular case.\n- Counterexample to Theorem 17\u2019s parity remark: K_3\u2212e.\n\nObstacles\n- Completing a fully general \u201cmeagreness is root\u2011invariant\u201d proof likely needs a comeagre union of marker\u2011ready cylinders that cover every point at infinitely many radii, to patch local re\u2011rootings globally. This is plausible but needs a careful construction, especially in =D with even D.\n\nNext steps (concrete, testable)\n- Fix Section 2 statements as above; add short proofs to proofs.md.\n- Replace Theorem 14(ii) sketch by the explicit boundary\u2011saturation construction and parity check.\n- Provide a precise gadget proof for Theorem 15 (even D), e.g., a ball that forces a cut vertex via two disjoint saturated \u201cports\u201d.\n- Write both directions for Theorem 16 (nowhere density at fixed distance; density overall) with explicit local modifications.\n- Rewrite Theorem 17 proof using finite class\u20112 subgraphs; remove the incorrect parity sentence.\n- Add Lemma A and Corollary B to settle the conjecture for nowhere denseness; develop Lemma C to cover meagreness on a comeagre domain.\n\nReferences to include\n- Aldous\u2013Lyons (2007): Processes on unimodular random networks; compactness of the local topology.\n- Benjamini\u2013Schramm foundational papers on local convergence.\n- Compactness theorem (logic) and Seymour\u2019s 6\u2011flow theorem, with precise citations replacing [4], [5], [7]."
