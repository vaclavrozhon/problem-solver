Critical review and actionable corrections

Ideas
- Tighten Section 2 (topology) by fixing off‑by‑one mistakes and clarifying the basic cylinders. Provide short, rigorous lemmas the verifier can drop into proofs.md.
- Make explicit necessary/sufficient conditions for nonemptiness of cylinders in the degree‑constrained subspaces (≤D and =D).
- Strengthen Theorems 14–17 with precise gadgets and parity arguments; point out a false claim in the proof sketch of Theorem 17 and replace it by a standard subgraph forcing argument.
- Clarify and partially resolve the “root‑invariance” conjecture: for unrooted P, S_P is saturated; nowhere denseness is root‑invariant. Give a local re‑rooting homeomorphism lemma toward the meagre case.

Corrections in the metric section (with proofs)
1) Off‑by‑one in the equivalence and neighborhoods.
- As stated, “d_\bullet((G,ρ),(H,σ))<2^{-r} iff B_r(G,ρ)≅B_r(H,σ)” is false. With R=\sup\{s: B_s(G,ρ)≅B_s(H,σ)\} and d_\bullet=2^{-R}, the correct equivalences are:
  - B_r(G,ρ)≅B_r(H,σ) iff d_\bullet((G,ρ),(H,σ))≤2^{-r}.
  - d_\bullet((G,ρ),(H,σ))<2^{-r} iff B_{r}(G,ρ)≅B_{r}(H,σ) and, in fact, B_{r+1}(G,ρ)≅B_{r+1}(H,σ).
- Correct form of Lemma 13 (first bullet): for every (G,x), r∈ℕ and every ε with 0<ε≤2^{-(r+1)},
  U_{2^{-r}+ε}((G,x))=\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{B_r(G,x)}.
  Proof: If B_r agrees, R≥r, so d≤2^{-r}<2^{-r}+ε. Conversely, if d<2^{-r}+ε≤2^{-r}+2^{-(r+1)}<2^{-r+1}, then d=2^{-q} with q≥r, hence B_r agrees.
- Cylinder sets \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F} are clopen. Openness follows from the display above; closedness because their complements are unions of (finitely many) cylinders at radius r that disagree with F.

2) Nonemptiness of cylinders under degree constraints.
- In \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}: Let F be an r‑ball. Then \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F}∩\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}≠∅ iff there exists a vertex at distance exactly r from the root with deg_F(v)<D. Necessity: otherwise any extension must be finite. Sufficiency: attach an infinite (≤D) tree beyond a boundary vertex of deficit without altering B_r.
- In \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}: \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F}∩\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}≠∅ iff (i) every vertex at distance <r has deg_F(v)=D; and (ii) at least one vertex at distance r has deg_F(v)<D. Necessity: adding edges to vertices at distance <r would change B_r; without a boundary deficit, any extension is finite. Sufficiency: attach disjoint infinite D‑regular trees to each boundary stub.

Nowhere density characterization (fixing Lemma 13)
- Correct criterion: S⊆X is nowhere dense iff ∀ r‑balls F with \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F}≠∅ ∃ r′ and F′ extending F such that \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F′}⊆\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F}\setminus\overline{S}. The version stated with “\setminus S” is too strong in general.

Remarks on Baire property
- \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D} is compact (standard; Aldous–Lyons). \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D} is closed in \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D} (degree equal to D is local across all radii in a connected graph), hence compact. Thus both are Baire, so “not meagre” is automatic. This deserves an explicit reference and/or proof.

Critique and repairs of Theorems 14–17
- Theorem 14 (≤D): The “attach a leaf” argument is sound: a pendant edge remains a bridge in any extension respecting ≤D. Add: argue that the leaf’s degree stays 1 and thus that edge is a bridge.
- Theorem 14 (=D, odd D): The parity gadget discussion is vague. A clean construction: Given a cylinder \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F}, extend to F′ so that every vertex at distance r′−1 has degree D and all but exactly one boundary vertex at distance r′ have degree D, the remaining one has degree D−1. In any D‑regular extension, exactly one external edge must attach at that boundary vertex. Removing it separates the finite ball from the infinite complement, i.e., a 1‑way infinite bridge. Parity enforces odd D (since D|V(B_{r′})|−2|E(B_{r′})|=1 must hold). This should replace the parity gadget paragraph.
- Even D: the same “one external edge” construction is impossible by parity; hence Theorem 15 becomes the right substitute. But the proof idea for Theorem 15 still needs a concrete gadget ensuring a cut vertex in all extensions in the even‑regular case; e.g., enforce a vertex whose D incident edges are partitioned into two internally saturated blocks within the ball, leaving two disjoint “through‑ports” whose continuation must go to different infinite parts, making that vertex a cut vertex. Details and parity checks are needed.
- Theorem 16: The sketch “distance k” ⇒ nowhere dense is plausible but incomplete. One needs: For fixed k, given any cylinder \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F}, refine to \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F′} such that within distance ≤k of the root, every potential candidate edge e lies in a cycle in any extension (kill 2‑way infinite bridges locally by forcing a bypass). Conversely, show density by explicitly extending F to contain a “dumbbell” consisting of two infinite trees connected by one edge well beyond r. Both directions should be written.
- Theorem 17: The claim “removing an edge preserves χ′=D+1 by parity” is false (e.g., K_3−e has χ′=2). A correct route: Fix a finite D‑regular class‑2 graph H (exists for all D≥3; e.g., odd complete graph for even D, snarks/Tashkinov constructions for odd D). For any cylinder, refine to embed H as a subgraph inside the ball (degrees inside the ball ≤D), then any extension has χ′≥χ′(H)=D+1. Hence the class‑1 set is nowhere dense. This removes the incorrect parity sentence.

Root‑invariance: what is true now
- Clarify: For unrooted P, S_P is saturated (closed under re‑rooting). For saturated S, both \overline{S} and Int(\overline{S}) are saturated.

Lemma A (closure and interior are saturated)
If S is saturated, then for any (G,ρ)∈\overline{S} and any vertex u, (G,u)∈\overline{S}. Proof: For each r choose (H_r,σ_r)∈S with B_r(H_r,σ_r)≅B_r(G,ρ). Transport the root along the isomorphism to the image of u (when u is within distance r; otherwise increase r). Since S is saturated, the re‑rooted (H_r,σ_r′)∈S and B_r(H_r,σ_r′)≅B_r(G,u). Hence (G,u)∈\overline{S}. Interior is then saturated because Int(\overline{S}) is a union of cylinders, and re‑rooting permutes cylinders.

Corollary B (root‑invariance for nowhere density)
For any unrooted property P, whether S_P is nowhere dense in \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D} does not depend on the root. Proof: S_P is saturated, and nowhere denseness is “Int(\overline{S_P})=∅”, which by Lemma A is invariant under re‑rooting.

Toward meagreness: a local re‑rooting homeomorphism
Lemma C (marker‑based local re‑rooting)
Given an r‑ball F and a vertex u of F, there is an extension F_mark on radius r′≥r and a clopen cylinder U=\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F_\mathrm{mark}} and a clopen V=\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F_\mathrm{mark}[u]} such that the map that re‑roots at the marked copy of u is a homeomorphism U→V. Construction: extend along the geodesic from root to u and attach a rigid tree beacon at a boundary vertex of that geodesic; uniqueness of the beacon pins down u. In ≤D the beacon uses spare degree; in =D, first locally saturate degrees then reserve one stub for the beacon (odd D is easy; even D needs a different cut‑vertex gadget). This supports local invariance of meagreness under re‑rooting on dense families of cylinders.

Examples
- D=2: verify even‑regular parity barrier for 1‑way bridges; removing a vertex in the bi‑infinite path shows cut vertices exist, supporting Theorem 15’s even‑regular case.
- Counterexample to Theorem 17’s parity remark: K_3−e.

Obstacles
- Completing a fully general “meagreness is root‑invariant” proof likely needs a comeagre union of marker‑ready cylinders that cover every point at infinitely many radii, to patch local re‑rootings globally. This is plausible but needs a careful construction, especially in =D with even D.

Next steps (concrete, testable)
- Fix Section 2 statements as above; add short proofs to proofs.md.
- Replace Theorem 14(ii) sketch by the explicit boundary‑saturation construction and parity check.
- Provide a precise gadget proof for Theorem 15 (even D), e.g., a ball that forces a cut vertex via two disjoint saturated “ports”.
- Write both directions for Theorem 16 (nowhere density at fixed distance; density overall) with explicit local modifications.
- Rewrite Theorem 17 proof using finite class‑2 subgraphs; remove the incorrect parity sentence.
- Add Lemma A and Corollary B to settle the conjecture for nowhere denseness; develop Lemma C to cover meagreness on a comeagre domain.
