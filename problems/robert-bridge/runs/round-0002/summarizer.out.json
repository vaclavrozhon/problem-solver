  "summary_md": "Proved (now rigorous): for any unrooted property P the set S_P = {(G,\u03c1): G has P} is saturated, and for any saturated S the closure cl(S) and interior Int(cl(S)) are also saturated (proof by transporting large matching balls and re\u2011rooting). Hence Int(cl(S_P))=\u2205 is root\u2011free, so nowhere density of S_P does not depend on the choice of root \u2014 the conjecture is resolved for nowhere density. Caveat: the quotient map that forgets the root need not be open, so meagreness cannot be transferred via a naive quotient argument. Current plan for the meagre part: build a comeagre locally rigid domain Good_\u221e via degree\u2011preserving markers so countably many partial re\u2011rooting homeomorphisms generate finite re\u2011rootings there; show each Bad_{m,\u2113} is nowhere dense so Good_\u221e is comeagre; conclude that saturations of nowhere\u2011dense sets are meagre. Remaining technical work: explicit marker gadgets (especially for \u0394= D, odd/even) and either a Borel/continuous selector on a comeagre domain or a counterexample.
