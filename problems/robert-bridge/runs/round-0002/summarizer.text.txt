{"summary_md":"Proved (now rigorous): for any unrooted property P the set S_P = {(G,ρ): G has P} is saturated, and for any saturated S the closure cl(S) and interior Int(cl(S)) are also saturated (proof by transporting large matching balls and re‑rooting). Hence Int(cl(S_P))=∅ is root‑free, so nowhere density of S_P does not depend on the choice of root — the conjecture is resolved for nowhere density. Caveat: the quotient map that forgets the root need not be open, so meagreness cannot be transferred via a naive quotient argument. Current plan for the meagre part: build a comeagre locally rigid domain Good_∞ via degree‑preserving markers so countably many partial re‑rooting homeomorphisms generate finite re‑rootings there; show each Bad_{m,ℓ} is nowhere dense so Good_∞ is comeagre; conclude that saturations of nowhere‑dense sets are meagre. Remaining technical work: explicit marker gadgets (especially for Δ= D, odd/even) and either a Borel/continuous selector on a comeagre domain or a counterexample.
