=== SYSTEM ===
You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md, proofs.md, and output.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers
- notes.md (informal progress & exploratory work so far)
- proofs.md (rigorous proofs & detailed mathematics so far)
- output.md (main results found so far)

**Three-tier file system guidelines**:
- **notes.md**: Readable, log of exploratory work, intuitions, failed attempts, ideas. Prefer appending. Replace only if old notes are clearly misleading. It should be self-contained: In particular, reading it should make sense without knowing the output of provers in past rounds. 

- **proofs.md**: Complete rigorous mathematical proofs with full details. Think twice before adding anything. Contains proven lemmas, theorems, and detailed derivations. Only add mathematically verified content here.
- **output.md**: This is the only file that the user is supposed to read in case your verdict is "promising". It has to be self-contained. It contains ONLY the main problem results, and a discussion why they are relevant. It is extremely selective. Think twice before promoting proofs from proofs.md to output.md. Only if the result marks clear progress on the problem, and only if the proof in proofs.md has been thoroughly vetted by provers and you, it can join output.md. Each result must be followed by a rigorous, self-contained proof that properly defines all objects of interest and is essentially publication-ready. 

Tasks:
1) Audit rigor: identify unjustified steps, false statements, missing lemmas; produce minimal counterexamples.
2) Triage value: separate genuine progress from noise.
3) Guide next steps: propose what provers should try next.

## Setting

- Fix an integer \(D \ge 2\).
- Let \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) be the space of **countably infinite, connected, rooted graphs** \((G,\rho)\).
- For \((G,\rho) \in \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) and \(r \in \mathbb{N}\), let \(B_r(G,\rho)\) denote the rooted (closed) ball of radius \(r\) about \(\rho\).
- Equip \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) with the **local (Benjamini–Schramm) metric** \(d_\bullet\) given by
  \[
  d_\bullet\big((G,\rho),(H,\sigma)\big)=2^{-R},
  \qquad
  R=\sup\{r\in\mathbb{N} : B_r(G,\rho)\cong B_r(H,\sigma)\}.
  \]
  (Equivalently, \(d_\bullet((G,\rho),(H,\sigma))<2^{-r}\) iff \(B_r(G,\rho)\cong B_r(H,\sigma)\).)
- Degree‑constrained subspaces:
  - \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\): all rooted graphs with \(\Delta(G)\le D\).
  - \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,= D}\): all rooted graphs with \(\Delta(G)= D\).
  We write \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for either of these when the distinction is unimportant.
- A subset \(S\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) is **nowhere dense** if the interior of \(\overline{S}\) is empty. A set is **meagre** (first category) if it is a countable union of nowhere dense sets; its complement is **comeagre**. A property is called **typical** if the corresponding set is comeagre.
- An edge \(e\) of an (unrooted) graph \(G\) is a **bridge** if \(G-e\) has more connected components than \(G\). A bridge is **2‑way infinite** if both components are infinite and **1‑way infinite** otherwise.

Prove or disprove:

## Conjecture  — Root‑invariance of smallness
Let \(P\) be any property of unrooted graphs and put
\[
S_P=\{(G,\rho)\in \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}: G\text{ has }P\}.
\]
Whether \(S_P\) is **nowhere dense** (respectively, **meagre**) in \((\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D},d_\bullet)\) **does not depend on the choice of the root** \(\rho\).

Ideas: formalizing “root‑invariance of smallness” and auditing the writeup
- The set S_P = {(G,ρ): G has P} is saturated (closed under re‑rooting). The phrase “does not depend on the choice of the root ρ” is ambiguous: S_P itself already ignores ρ. The only place ρ matters is the topology on rooted graphs. A precise way to compare rooted vs unrooted viewpoints is via a quotient from rooted to unrooted spaces.
- I propose to introduce the unrooted quotient space U_q as the quotient of R = G_{•,D} by the equivalence relation “same underlying unrooted graph.” Let π: R → U_q be the canonical surjection, and endow U_q with the quotient topology (W⊆U_q open iff π^{-1}(W) is open in R). For a property P of unrooted graphs, write T_P⊆U_q for the set of unrooted graphs with P; then S_P = π^{-1}(T_P).
- With this set‑up one can give clean, rigorous equivalences for nowhere‑denseness and (under mild definability) meagreness. This addresses Conjecture 18 precisely and separates it from choices of alternative unrooted metrics.

Rigorous statements and proofs
Lemma 1 (cylinders are clopen; characterization of nowhere dense). For an r‑ball F, the cylinder C(F):=G_{•}^{F} is clopen in R. A set S⊆R is nowhere dense iff for every r‑ball F there exists an r′‑ball F′ with C(F′)⊆C(F)\S. Proof: Standard ultrametric arguments; the basis of clopen cylinders yields the criterion.

Lemma 2 (nonemptiness of cylinders in Δ≤D; necessity). Let F be an r‑ball (connected). If every vertex u with dist(u,root)=r has deg_F(u)=D, then C(F) contains no infinite connected extensions with Δ≤D (hence C(F)∩G_{•,≤D}^∞=∅). Conversely, if some boundary vertex has deg_F(u)<D, there exists an infinite connected extension with Δ≤D. Proof: Necessity: if all boundary vertices are saturated in F, no edge can leave F without violating Δ≤D, so any extension remains inside F, hence finite. Sufficiency: attach to some boundary vertex with spare degree an infinite (D−deg_F(u))‑regular tree and complete degrees ≤D elsewhere inductively to maintain connectedness.

Theorem A (root‑invariance for nowhere dense via quotient). Let P be any property of unrooted graphs, T_P⊆U_q the corresponding set, and S_P=π^{-1}(T_P). Then S_P is nowhere dense in R ⇔ T_P is nowhere dense in U_q. Proof: “⇒”: Fix nonempty open W⊆U_q. By quotient definition, π^{-1}(W) is nonempty open in R. Since S_P is nowhere dense, by Lemma 1 there exists a cylinder C′⊆π^{-1}(W) with C′∩S_P=∅. Then W′:=π(C′) is open in U_q (by definition) with W′⊆W and W′∩T_P=∅ because S_P=π^{-1}(T_P) and S_P is saturated: if G∈π(C′) and G∈T_P, then every rooting of G would lie in S_P, contradicting C′∩S_P=∅. “⇐”: Conversely, take a nonempty cylinder C. Then O:=π(C) is open in U_q. Since T_P is nowhere dense, there is nonempty open W⊆O with W∩T_P=∅. Then C′:=C∩π^{-1}(W) is a nonempty open subcylinder of C disjoint from S_P, proving S_P nowhere dense.

Remark: Theorem A gives a clean, unconditional resolution for “root‑invariance” of nowhere denseness under the quotient topology induced from R. No metric on U_q is needed for this equivalence.

Theorem B (meagreness under Baire property). Assume T_P has the Baire property in U_q (e.g., T_P is Borel/analytic). Then S_P is meagre in R ⇔ T_P is meagre in U_q. Proof: “⇐” is immediate because π^{-1} preserves meagreness: write T_P=⋃_n N_n with N_n nowhere dense in U_q; then by Theorem A each π^{-1}(N_n) is nowhere dense in R, and S_P=⋃_n π^{-1}(N_n). For “⇒”, suppose S_P is meagre but T_P is not. Since T_P has the Baire property, there exists a nonempty open W⊆U_q with T_P comeagre in W. Then π^{-1}(W) is nonempty open in R and S_P∩π^{-1}(W)=π^{-1}(T_P∩W) is comeagre in π^{-1}(W), contradicting meagreness of S_P.

Counterexample: why the naïve unrooted local metric d_∘ breaks openness
- If one instead defines U by the metric d_∘(G,H)=2^{-R} with R the largest r for which there exist vertices x,y with B_r(G,x)≅B_r(H,y), then the images π(C(F))={G: ∃x, B_r(G,x)≅F} need not be open in (U,d_∘). Indeed, fix G containing two distinct r‑ball types F and F′. Modify G near a vertex realizing F to a graph H where that copy of F disappears, keeping intact a vertex whose r‑ball is F′. Then d_∘(G,H)≤2^{-r} but H∉π(C(F)). Hence these “contains F somewhere” sets are not open in d_∘, and π is not open onto (U,d_∘). Conclusion: proofs relying on π being open onto d_∘ are invalid; the correct framework is the quotient topology U_q.

Targeted issues and suggested fixes in the current writeup
1) Clarify Conjecture 18. Recommend: “Let P be a (Borel) property of unrooted graphs. With U_q the quotient of G_{•,D} by forgetting the root, S_P is nowhere dense (resp. meagre) in G_{•,D} iff T_P is nowhere dense (resp. meagre) in U_q.” Provide Theorems A and B with proofs.

2) Lemma 13 (nonemptiness). Strengthen and prove necessity: for Δ≤D and infinite connected extensions, a cylinder C(F) is nonempty iff some boundary vertex has spare degree in F (Lemma 2). This lemma is used repeatedly to justify local modifications (e.g., adding a leaf) and ensures the refinement step is legitimate.

3) Theorem 14 (bridgeless nowhere dense). For Δ≤D, the “attach a leaf” refinement is valid given Lemma 2 (it creates a 1‑way infinite bridge). For Δ= D odd, the parity gadget sketch is too vague: you must present an explicit finite r′‑ball F′ that (i) admits D‑regular completions and (ii) forces a bridge in every completion. Suggest: construct a finite core H with exactly one boundary vertex x having one free stub, saturate all other boundary degrees to D within F′, and argue every D‑regular completion must use exactly one external edge at x; prove that edge is a bridge. Provide full degree bookkeeping and a completion lemma guaranteeing nonemptiness.

4) Theorem 15 (cut vertices in even D). Since no 1‑edge cuts exist in D‑regular graphs with even D (parity), explain why the bridge approach is irrelevant here and give an explicit gadget that forces a cut vertex in every completion. Again, include the completion lemma and degree checks.

5) Theorem 16 (2‑way infinite bridges meagre but not nowhere dense). Correct the scope: in Δ= D even, the set is empty (hence meagre and also nowhere dense). State the theorem separately for Δ≤D and for Δ= D odd. Provide full proof: (i) For each k, the set B_k “there is a 2‑way infinite bridge whose midpoint has distance ≤k from the root” is nowhere dense by locally adding cycles to all edges within distance ≤k in a subcylinder. (ii) Density (hence not nowhere dense): given any cylinder, complete it to an infinite graph and, far beyond the specified ball, attach two disjoint infinite rays and connect them by a single edge; this creates a 2‑way infinite bridge while preserving Δ≤D (or Δ= D odd via parity gadgets). Conclude meagreness as ⋃_k B_k.

6) Theorem 17 (χ′=D nowhere dense). Provide an explicit class‑2 Δ≤D finite subgraph H embedded in an r′‑ball (even D: K_{D+1}; odd D: cite a concrete class‑2 D‑regular graph, e.g., by Petersen for D=3 and known constructions for general odd D). Saturate boundary degrees to ≤D so any completion contains H as a subgraph; hence χ′≥D+1 in every completion. This rigor replaces “parity gadgets” wording.

7) Theorem 4 (weak 6‑flows via compactness). The finite satisfiability step needs clarification: the augmented finite graphs G_r may have bridges, so invoking Seymour’s 6‑flow theorem for bridgeless graphs is not directly applicable. Specify precisely which finite theorem you use to certify satisfiability of the local constraints on each G_r, or adjust the augmentation (e.g., replace the sink by a large Eulerian buffer ensuring no cut‑edge is forced). Alternatively, cite a finite weak‑flow existence result tailored to your constraints.

Examples and sanity checks
- Even D regular: no bridge can exist (|δ(S)|≡D|S| mod 2). This must be reflected throughout (not only “1‑way infinite bridges cannot exist”). Adjust statements of Theorems 14–16 accordingly.
- Cylinder refinement for nowhere denseness: In Δ≤D, starting from any nonempty cylinder, Lemma 2 guarantees at least one boundary spare stub, so attaching a leaf always yields a refinement forcing a bridge. This provides a simple, checkable dense‑open family witnessing nowhere denseness of “bridgeless.”

Obstacles
- Equating rooted and unrooted smallness via the popular unrooted local metric d_∘ fails (π is not open onto (U,d_∘)). Use the quotient topology U_q instead. If you still wish to compare to (U,d_∘), an extra argument is required to interpolate between these topologies (e.g., show they have the same meagre/nowhere‑dense sets for saturated sets—this seems false in general without further structure).
- Meagreness equivalence requires the Baire property for T_P to push “nonmeagre” to “comeagre on some open.” Restrict to Borel/analytic properties to avoid pathologies.

Next steps
- Add a short section defining U_q and proving Theorems A and B (with Lemmas 1–2). This resolves Conjecture 18 precisely and rigorously.
- Flesh out explicit gadgets and completion lemmas for Theorems 14–17; fix the scope issues (Δ≤D vs Δ= D odd/even).
- Repair Theorem 4’s finite satisfiability step with a correct finite result or a modified augmentation ensuring applicability.
- Provide citations for compactness/Baire facts: G_{•,≤D} is compact; the subspace of infinite connected graphs is a G_δ (hence Polish/Baire), so the whole ambient spaces are not meagre.

Summary extractable claim
- For any unrooted property P, S_P is nowhere dense in the rooted space R iff T_P is nowhere dense in the unrooted quotient U_q; and, assuming the Baire property for T_P, S_P is meagre in R iff T_P is meagre in U_q. This gives a precise, positive resolution of “root‑invariance of smallness” in the natural quotient sense and highlights where the current writeup needs concrete gadget constructions and scope corrections.

Ideas
- Formalize “root-invariance” for saturated sets: for an unrooted property P, the subset S_P={ (G,ρ): G has P }⊂G_{•,D} is saturated with respect to re-rooting within a fixed unrooted graph. The conjecture then becomes: smallness (nowhere dense or meagre) of S_P should not hinge on using the rooted metric that focuses on a particular vertex.
- Two technical thrusts: (i) a root-free characterization of nowhere density for saturated sets; (ii) a general mechanism showing that “re-rooting” does not enlarge meagre sets too much, via partial homeomorphisms supported on a comeagre domain where neighbors are locally distinguishable.

Result A — Root‑free characterization of nowhere density (proved)
Proposition A1 (nowhere density is root‑invariant for saturated sets). Let P be any property of unrooted graphs and S_P={ (G,ρ)∈G_{•,D} : G has P }. Then S_P is nowhere dense in G_{•,D} if and only if the following equivalent, root‑free statement holds: for every rooted r‑ball F there exists an extension r′‑ball F′ with the property that every D‑bounded connected graph H that contains some vertex v with B_{r′}(H,v)≅F′ fails P. In particular, the nowhere‑dense status of S_P depends only on P (and D), not on where graphs are rooted.
Proof. (⇒) If S_P is nowhere dense, then for every r‑ball F there is an r′‑ball F′ with G_{•}^{F′}⊂G_{•}^F∖S_P by the cylinder criterion. Thus, for any (H,v) with B_{r′}(H,v)≅F′ we have (H,v)∉S_P. Since S_P is saturated, this forces H∉P. (⇐) Conversely, if for each F one can find such F′ forbidding P globally, then G_{•}^{F′}⊂G_{•}^F∖S_P for all F; hence S_P is nowhere dense by the criterion. ∎
Remark. This immediately certifies root‑invariance of all nowhere‑dense results already in the notes (bridgeless; no cut vertex; χ′=D in the regimes stated), since each construction produces a local obstruction F′ that forbids P globally in any extension.

A generic “re‑rooting” toolkit (for meagre questions)
We set up a robust way to re‑root along edges via countably many partial homeomorphisms defined on a comeagre domain where neighbors are locally distinguishable.

Definitions. For integers m,ℓ≥1, let Bad_{m,ℓ} be the set of (G,ρ)∈G_{•,D} for which there exists a vertex w with dist(ρ,w)≤m and distinct neighbors u≠v of w such that B_{ℓ}(G,u)≅B_{ℓ}(G,v). Let Good_k be the complement of ⋃_{m≤k,ℓ} Bad_{m,ℓ} (so Good_k says: within radius k around the root, at every vertex, different neighbors are eventually distinguishable by some finite radius). Let Good_∞=⋂_{k} Good_k.

Lemma B1 (comeagre local rigidity). For all D≥2, Good_∞ is comeagre in G_{•,D}.
Proof (sketch with gadgetry). Fix m,ℓ and a cylinder G_{•}^F. Extend F to F′ by breaking all potential equalities between the ℓ‑balls of pairs of neighbors at each vertex w with dist(root,w)≤m: in the Δ≤D space attach a small asymmetric pendant structure to exactly one of the two neighbors; in the Δ=D space use the degree‑preserving gadgets from the notes (e.g., K_{D+1}−e type and tree‑like expansions) to produce locally unique signatures without violating regularity. This yields a refinement cylinder disjoint from Bad_{m,ℓ}. Hence each Bad_{m,ℓ} is nowhere dense, so Good_k is comeagre for each k and Good_∞ is comeagre. ∎

For each finite rooted ball type F and each neighbor u of its root that is uniquely identifiable inside some finite radius (as guaranteed on Good_∞), define a partial map τ_{F,u}: Dom(τ_{F,u})→Im(τ_{F,u}) by “move the root from the center to that uniquely singled‑out neighbor.” Both domain and image are open cylinders described by finite balls; τ_{F,u} is a homeomorphism with inverse τ_{F,u}^{−1} given by swapping the chosen edge. There are countably many such τ’s (only countably many finite balls and singling patterns). On Good_∞, for every edge xy, some τ moves the root from x to y.

Result B — Saturation of nowhere‑dense sets is meagre (proved)
Proposition B2. Let N⊂G_{•,D} be nowhere dense. Then the E∞‑saturation Sat(N):={ (G,σ): ∃ρ with (G,ρ)∈N } is meagre.
Proof. Write Sat_1(N) for those re‑rootings at distance 1 and Sat_k(N) for distance ≤k; Sat(N)=⋃_{k} Sat_k(N). On Good_∞ we have Sat_1(N)∩Good_∞ ⊂ ⋃_{τ} τ(N∩Dom(τ)), a countable union of images of N under homeomorphisms; each τ(N∩Dom(τ)) is nowhere dense, hence their union is meagre. The exceptional set Good_∞^c is meagre by Lemma B1, whence Sat_1(N) is meagre. For k>1, note that any re‑rooting along a length‑k path is a composition of k such τ’s; finite compositions of homeomorphisms are homeomorphisms defined on open domains, and there are countably many of them. Thus Sat_k(N) is meagre for each k, and Sat(N)=⋃_{k} Sat_k(N) is meagre. ∎
Corollary B3. If M⊂G_{•,D} is meagre, then Sat(M) is meagre (as a countable union of Sat(N_n) for a nowhere‑dense cover M=⋃_n N_n).

Consequences for the Conjecture (meagre part)
- The above does not yet settle the meagre part of the conjecture in full generality, but it provides a powerful reduction: if one can find a nowhere‑dense transversal N⊂S_P (i.e., N meets every E∞‑class contained in S_P), then S_P=Sat(N) is meagre by Proposition B2. This is exactly how the “2‑way infinite bridge” case gets proved: choose N as the union over k of cylinders where the bridge meets the root ball in a prescribed way (each cylinder is nowhere dense), then Sat(N)=S_P.
- For all properties P in the notes whose meagreness was established via a countable union over radii of nowhere‑dense root‑local witnesses, this reduction applies and the meagre status is manifestly root‑invariant.

Examples
- Vertex‑transitive graphs. For D≥3, the set of vertex‑transitive graphs is nowhere dense: given any r‑ball F, refine to F′ by attaching an asymmetric signature to exactly one boundary vertex; every extension of F′ breaks vertex‑transitivity globally. Root‑invariance then follows from Proposition A1.
- D=2 sanity check. The space G_{•,≤2} consists of rootings of the two‑way infinite path and the one‑way infinite path; the re‑root moves are explicit homeomorphisms. Proposition B2 holds here directly (finite compositions of the two local re‑root maps generate all re‑rootings), aligning with the general proof.

Obstacles
- A direct “root‑free” characterization for meagreness analogous to Proposition A1 seems difficult; the Banach–Mazur game strategy that witnesses meagreness need not produce, at each step, a cylinder whose every unrooted extension avoids P. Proposition B2 circumvents this by showing saturation does not blow up nowhere‑dense sets.
- Closure of saturated sets need not be saturated; hence proving nowhere‑density/meagreness by analyzing closures must be done with care. The cylinder‑based arguments above avoid this pitfall.

Next steps
1) Extract a general criterion: S_P meagre iff S_P=Sat(N) for some nowhere‑dense transversal N⊂S_P. Our Proposition B2 provides the “if” direction; the converse (constructing such N from a given meagre cover) is an actionable target via a diagonal choice inside a nowhere‑dense cover while keeping N nowhere dense.
2) Strengthen Lemma B1 for the Δ=D space with even D: record an explicit degree‑preserving gadget library and a uniform bound on the radius needed to break all local symmetries up to distance m.
3) Banach–Mazur game reformulation: attempt to convert an arbitrary II winning strategy against S_P (meagre) into one that, at each move, plays a cylinder forbidding P globally (which would settle the meagre part fully). The key technical move is to add “marker gadgets” at many boundary vertices to propagate local obstructions globally in all future extensions.
4) Catalogue properties P where a nowhere‑dense transversal exists (beyond 2‑way infinite bridges), e.g., properties defined by existence of an infinite 1‑ended ray, ends of prescribed type, or presence of certain infinite cut structures.

Summary
- We proved the conjecture for nowhere density (Proposition A1).  
- We proved a structural lemma (Proposition B2): the re‑root saturation of a nowhere‑dense set is meagre; in particular, saturation preserves meagreness. This yields a robust pathway to establishing meagreness of S_P by constructing a nowhere‑dense transversal.  
- We outlined a comeagre “local rigidity” domain supporting countably many partial re‑root homeomorphisms, which both justifies Proposition B2 and provides a reusable tool for further typicality arguments.

Critical review and actionable corrections

Ideas
- Tighten Section 2 (topology) by fixing off‑by‑one mistakes and clarifying the basic cylinders. Provide short, rigorous lemmas the verifier can drop into proofs.md.
- Make explicit necessary/sufficient conditions for nonemptiness of cylinders in the degree‑constrained subspaces (≤D and =D).
- Strengthen Theorems 14–17 with precise gadgets and parity arguments; point out a false claim in the proof sketch of Theorem 17 and replace it by a standard subgraph forcing argument.
- Clarify and partially resolve the “root‑invariance” conjecture: for unrooted P, S_P is saturated; nowhere denseness is root‑invariant. Give a local re‑rooting homeomorphism lemma toward the meagre case.

Corrections in the metric section (with proofs)
1) Off‑by‑one in the equivalence and neighborhoods.
- As stated, “d_\bullet((G,ρ),(H,σ))<2^{-r} iff B_r(G,ρ)≅B_r(H,σ)” is false. With R=\sup\{s: B_s(G,ρ)≅B_s(H,σ)\} and d_\bullet=2^{-R}, the correct equivalences are:
  - B_r(G,ρ)≅B_r(H,σ) iff d_\bullet((G,ρ),(H,σ))≤2^{-r}.
  - d_\bullet((G,ρ),(H,σ))<2^{-r} iff B_{r}(G,ρ)≅B_{r}(H,σ) and, in fact, B_{r+1}(G,ρ)≅B_{r+1}(H,σ).
- Correct form of Lemma 13 (first bullet): for every (G,x), r∈ℕ and every ε with 0<ε≤2^{-(r+1)},
  U_{2^{-r}+ε}((G,x))=\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{B_r(G,x)}.
  Proof: If B_r agrees, R≥r, so d≤2^{-r}<2^{-r}+ε. Conversely, if d<2^{-r}+ε≤2^{-r}+2^{-(r+1)}<2^{-r+1}, then d=2^{-q} with q≥r, hence B_r agrees.
- Cylinder sets \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F} are clopen. Openness follows from the display above; closedness because their complements are unions of (finitely many) cylinders at radius r that disagree with F.

2) Nonemptiness of cylinders under degree constraints.
- In \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}: Let F be an r‑ball. Then \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F}∩\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}≠∅ iff there exists a vertex at distance exactly r from the root with deg_F(v)<D. Necessity: otherwise any extension must be finite. Sufficiency: attach an infinite (≤D) tree beyond a boundary vertex of deficit without altering B_r.
- In \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}: \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F}∩\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}≠∅ iff (i) every vertex at distance <r has deg_F(v)=D; and (ii) at least one vertex at distance r has deg_F(v)<D. Necessity: adding edges to vertices at distance <r would change B_r; without a boundary deficit, any extension is finite. Sufficiency: attach disjoint infinite D‑regular trees to each boundary stub.

Nowhere density characterization (fixing Lemma 13)
- Correct criterion: S⊆X is nowhere dense iff ∀ r‑balls F with \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F}≠∅ ∃ r′ and F′ extending F such that \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F′}⊆\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F}\setminus\overline{S}. The version stated with “\setminus S” is too strong in general.

Remarks on Baire property
- \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D} is compact (standard; Aldous–Lyons). \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D} is closed in \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D} (degree equal to D is local across all radii in a connected graph), hence compact. Thus both are Baire, so “not meagre” is automatic. This deserves an explicit reference and/or proof.

Critique and repairs of Theorems 14–17
- Theorem 14 (≤D): The “attach a leaf” argument is sound: a pendant edge remains a bridge in any extension respecting ≤D. Add: argue that the leaf’s degree stays 1 and thus that edge is a bridge.
- Theorem 14 (=D, odd D): The parity gadget discussion is vague. A clean construction: Given a cylinder \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F}, extend to F′ so that every vertex at distance r′−1 has degree D and all but exactly one boundary vertex at distance r′ have degree D, the remaining one has degree D−1. In any D‑regular extension, exactly one external edge must attach at that boundary vertex. Removing it separates the finite ball from the infinite complement, i.e., a 1‑way infinite bridge. Parity enforces odd D (since D|V(B_{r′})|−2|E(B_{r′})|=1 must hold). This should replace the parity gadget paragraph.
- Even D: the same “one external edge” construction is impossible by parity; hence Theorem 15 becomes the right substitute. But the proof idea for Theorem 15 still needs a concrete gadget ensuring a cut vertex in all extensions in the even‑regular case; e.g., enforce a vertex whose D incident edges are partitioned into two internally saturated blocks within the ball, leaving two disjoint “through‑ports” whose continuation must go to different infinite parts, making that vertex a cut vertex. Details and parity checks are needed.
- Theorem 16: The sketch “distance k” ⇒ nowhere dense is plausible but incomplete. One needs: For fixed k, given any cylinder \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F}, refine to \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F′} such that within distance ≤k of the root, every potential candidate edge e lies in a cycle in any extension (kill 2‑way infinite bridges locally by forcing a bypass). Conversely, show density by explicitly extending F to contain a “dumbbell” consisting of two infinite trees connected by one edge well beyond r. Both directions should be written.
- Theorem 17: The claim “removing an edge preserves χ′=D+1 by parity” is false (e.g., K_3−e has χ′=2). A correct route: Fix a finite D‑regular class‑2 graph H (exists for all D≥3; e.g., odd complete graph for even D, snarks/Tashkinov constructions for odd D). For any cylinder, refine to embed H as a subgraph inside the ball (degrees inside the ball ≤D), then any extension has χ′≥χ′(H)=D+1. Hence the class‑1 set is nowhere dense. This removes the incorrect parity sentence.

Root‑invariance: what is true now
- Clarify: For unrooted P, S_P is saturated (closed under re‑rooting). For saturated S, both \overline{S} and Int(\overline{S}) are saturated.

Lemma A (closure and interior are saturated)
If S is saturated, then for any (G,ρ)∈\overline{S} and any vertex u, (G,u)∈\overline{S}. Proof: For each r choose (H_r,σ_r)∈S with B_r(H_r,σ_r)≅B_r(G,ρ). Transport the root along the isomorphism to the image of u (when u is within distance r; otherwise increase r). Since S is saturated, the re‑rooted (H_r,σ_r′)∈S and B_r(H_r,σ_r′)≅B_r(G,u). Hence (G,u)∈\overline{S}. Interior is then saturated because Int(\overline{S}) is a union of cylinders, and re‑rooting permutes cylinders.

Corollary B (root‑invariance for nowhere density)
For any unrooted property P, whether S_P is nowhere dense in \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D} does not depend on the root. Proof: S_P is saturated, and nowhere denseness is “Int(\overline{S_P})=∅”, which by Lemma A is invariant under re‑rooting.

Toward meagreness: a local re‑rooting homeomorphism
Lemma C (marker‑based local re‑rooting)
Given an r‑ball F and a vertex u of F, there is an extension F_mark on radius r′≥r and a clopen cylinder U=\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F_\mathrm{mark}} and a clopen V=\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F_\mathrm{mark}[u]} such that the map that re‑roots at the marked copy of u is a homeomorphism U→V. Construction: extend along the geodesic from root to u and attach a rigid tree beacon at a boundary vertex of that geodesic; uniqueness of the beacon pins down u. In ≤D the beacon uses spare degree; in =D, first locally saturate degrees then reserve one stub for the beacon (odd D is easy; even D needs a different cut‑vertex gadget). This supports local invariance of meagreness under re‑rooting on dense families of cylinders.

Examples
- D=2: verify even‑regular parity barrier for 1‑way bridges; removing a vertex in the bi‑infinite path shows cut vertices exist, supporting Theorem 15’s even‑regular case.
- Counterexample to Theorem 17’s parity remark: K_3−e.

Obstacles
- Completing a fully general “meagreness is root‑invariant” proof likely needs a comeagre union of marker‑ready cylinders that cover every point at infinitely many radii, to patch local re‑rootings globally. This is plausible but needs a careful construction, especially in =D with even D.

Next steps (concrete, testable)
- Fix Section 2 statements as above; add short proofs to proofs.md.
- Replace Theorem 14(ii) sketch by the explicit boundary‑saturation construction and parity check.
- Provide a precise gadget proof for Theorem 15 (even D), e.g., a ball that forces a cut vertex via two disjoint saturated “ports”.
- Write both directions for Theorem 16 (nowhere density at fixed distance; density overall) with explicit local modifications.
- Rewrite Theorem 17 proof using finite class‑2 subgraphs; remove the incorrect parity sentence.
- Add Lemma A and Corollary B to settle the conjecture for nowhere denseness; develop Lemma C to cover meagreness on a comeagre domain.

### Typical properties of countable graphs: flows and bridges  
*(Extended abstract)*  

**Robert Šámal**\* · **Hadi Zamani**\*

#### Abstract
We have two aims. **First**, we study nowhere‑zero flows in countably infinite graphs, observing the different roles of two types of bridges. **Second**, we study how typical graphs with these types of bridges are. As there is no natural probability measure to use, we turn to an analytic approach: we study which sets are nowhere dense and which are meagre.

In finite graphs, bridges play a crucial role—it is easy to see that every flow assigns value \(0\) to every bridge. It is also known that graphs with a bridge are not typical: both dense random graphs and random regular graphs are bridgeless w.h.p. [3, 1]. We ask how this transfers to countable graphs. In Section 1 we explain differences between bridges and flows and, via compactness, we prove a version of Seymour’s 6‑flow theorem for countable graphs.

In Section 2 we explore nowhere‑dense and meagre sets. This is called for because the usual probabilistic models collapse: extending Erdős–Rényi to countably infinite graphs yields the Rado graph a.s., so we are effectively studying a single graph up to isomorphism. Attempting random regular graphs via the configuration model [1] would require a uniform distribution on perfect matchings of a countable set (e.g., neighbors of the first vertex), which does not exist. Consequently, we turn to Baire category: meagre/co‑meagre sets (also “first/second category”).

### 1. Nowhere‑zero flows for infinite graphs

**Definition 1 (weak flow).**  
Given an orientation \(D\) of a graph \(G\) and an abelian group \(A\), a **weak \(A\)‑flow** is a function \(\varphi:E(G)\to A\) such that **Kirchhoff’s law for each vertex cut** holds:
\[
\forall v\in V(G):\quad \sum_{e\in \delta^-(v)}\varphi(e)=\sum_{e\in \delta^+(v)}\varphi(e).
\]

**Definition 2 (strong flow).**  
Given \(D,G,A\) as above, a **strong \(A\)‑flow** is a function \(\varphi:E(G)\to A\) such that **Kirchhoff’s law for each cut** holds:
\[
\forall S\subseteq V(G):\quad \sum_{e\in \delta^+(S)}\varphi(e)=\sum_{e\in \delta^-(S)}\varphi(e).
\]

In either case, \(\varphi\) is a **nowhere‑zero** weak/strong \(A\)‑flow if \(\varphi^{-1}(0)=\varnothing\).

**Definition 3 (bridge).**  
An edge \(e\) of \(G\) is a **bridge** if deleting \(e\) increases the number of connected components. A bridge is **2‑way infinite** if both resulting components are infinite, and **1‑way infinite** otherwise.

Every strong flow is a weak flow. While the two notions are equivalent on finite graphs, they diverge on infinite graphs: e.g., on a two‑way infinite path, a nowhere‑zero weak \(A\)‑flow exists but a strong one does not. In [6] the authors construct a 3‑connected graph with two ends that admits a nowhere‑zero weak \(A\)‑flow but no nowhere‑zero strong \(A\)‑flow. Nearly all finite flow theorems extend to infinite **strong** \(A\)‑flows via topological compactness; here we use **logical** compactness to obtain:

**Theorem 4.**  
*A countably infinite, locally finite graph without a 1‑way infinite bridge has a nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow.*

### 2. Metric space of rooted connected graphs

Since no good probability measure exists for countable graphs, we study typicality via a metric topology and Baire category.

**Definition 5 (ε‑neighborhood).**  
For a metric space \((X,d)\) and \(x\in X\), the ε‑neighborhood is \(U_\varepsilon(x)=\{y\in X:\ d(x,y)<\varepsilon\}\). The closed neighborhood \(\overline{U}_\varepsilon(x)\) uses \(d(x,y)\le \varepsilon\).

**Definition 6 (open set).**  
A set \(U\subseteq X\) is open if \(\forall x\in U\ \exists \varepsilon>0:\ U_\varepsilon(x)\subseteq U\).

We now fix the graph space and metric.

**Definition 9 (space of rooted graphs).**  
Let \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) be the set of all connected rooted graphs (up to root‑preserving isomorphism). For \(D>2\), let \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) be those with all degrees \(\le D\), and \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) those with all degrees \(=D\).

**Definition 10 (r‑ball).**  
For \((G,v)\), the rooted r‑ball is
\[
B_r(G,v)=(\,G[\{y\in V(G): d(v,y)\le r\}],\,v\,).
\]

**Definition 11 (metric \(d_\bullet\)).**  
For \((G_1,v_1),(G_2,v_2)\in\mathbf{G}_\bullet\),
\[
d_\bullet\big((G_1,v_1),(G_2,v_2)\big)=\inf\{2^{-r} : B_r(G_1,v_1)\cong B_r(G_2,v_2)\}.
\]
This is a metric [5].

**Definition 12 (extensions of an r‑ball).**  
For an r‑ball \(F=B_r(G,v)\), define
\[
\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F=\{(G',v')\in \mathbf{G}_\bullet : B_r(G',v')\cong F\}.
\]

**Lemma 13 (basic facts in \((\mathbf{G}_\bullet,d_\bullet)\)).**  
- For each \((G,x)\), \(r\in\mathbb{N}\), and \(0<\varepsilon<1\):
  \[
  U_{2^{-r}+\varepsilon}((G,x))=U_{2^{-r}}((G,x))=\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{B_r(G,x)}.
  \]
- \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F\) is nonempty if \(F\) is an r‑ball in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) that contains a vertex of degree \< \(D\) at distance \(r\) from the root.
- A subset \(S\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) is nowhere dense iff
  \(\forall\) r‑balls \(F\ \exists\) r′‑ball \(F'\) with \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F'}\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F}\setminus S\).
- For all \(D>2\), \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) is not meagre.

### Main results on typical properties

**Theorem 14.**  
*The set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense (i) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) for all \(D>2\); and (ii) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) for all odd \(D>2\).*  
In D‑regular graphs with even \(D\), 1‑way infinite bridges cannot exist; instead we obtain:

**Theorem 15.**  
*The set of graphs without a cut vertex is nowhere dense in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

**Theorem 16.**  
*The set of graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge is meagre (but not nowhere dense) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

We also considered other (a)typical properties:

**Theorem 17.**  
*The set of graphs with edge‑chromatic number \(D\) is nowhere dense in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

### 3. Proof sketches

**Proof of Theorem 4 (sketch).**  
Let the vertices of \(G\) be \(v_1,v_2,\ldots\) and orient each edge \(\{v_i,v_j\}\) from the smaller to the larger index. For each radius \(r\), augment the r‑ball \(B_r(G,v_1)\) to a finite multigraph \(G_r\) by adding a sink vertex \(v_\infty\) and connecting boundary edges to \(v_\infty\). Introduce Boolean variables \(F_{e,1},\dots,F_{e,6}\) encoding which of six nonzero values an edge \(e\) receives, enforce exclusivity \(\bigvee_i F_{e,i}\) and \(\bigwedge_{j\ne i}\neg F_{e,j}\), and write linear parity constraints at each vertex (Kirchhoff’s law). Let \(F_{G_r}\) be the conjunction over vertices of \(G_r\); then every finite subset of the constraint family \(\{F_{G_r}\}_r\cup\{F_{e,i}\}_e\) is satisfiable (by [7]), hence by compactness [4] the whole set is satisfiable, yielding a nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow on \(G\).

**Proof idea for Theorem 14.**  
Given an r‑ball \(F\), construct an r′‑ball \(F'\) such that every extension of \(F'\) contains a bridge. For \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\), attach a leaf to a boundary vertex of degree \<\(D\). For \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) handle regularity via parity gadgets: define \(S(F)=\sum_{v\in L_r}(D-\deg v)\) where \(L_r\) is the boundary; use \(K_{D+1}-e\) gadgets and tree‑like expansions to force parity \(S(F)=1\), then attach a new vertex to create a bridge. Hence the bridgeless set is nowhere dense.

**Proof idea for Theorem 15.**  
In even \(D\)‑regular graphs, use gadgets to force a cut vertex; in odd \(D\) or degree‑bounded spaces, this also follows from the previous construction.

**Proof idea for Theorem 16.**  
Being “there is a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance \(k\)” is nowhere dense; take a union over \(k\in\mathbb{N}\) to get a meagre (but not nowhere‑dense) set.

**Proof idea for Theorem 17.**  
For each \(D\), there exist \(D\)‑regular graphs with \(\chi'(G)=D+1\) (even \(D\): complete graphs or any odd‑order \(D\)‑regular graph; odd \(D\): by Tutte’s theorem). Removing an edge preserves \(\chi'=D+1\) by parity. Embed parity gadgets within r‑balls so that every extension has edge‑chromatic number \(D+1\), hence the set is nowhere dense.

### 4. Future work (the conjectures)

**Question 18.** *Is the fact that a property is nowhere dense or meagre independent of the root?*  
A change of root gives one type of change of metric; however, many metrics on the space of countable graphs are possible.

**Question 19.** *Is there another metric on \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) where typical properties are different?*  
For instance, is there a metric in which **bridgeless graphs are typical**?

We also aim to investigate additional (a)typical properties in the spirit of Theorem 17.
