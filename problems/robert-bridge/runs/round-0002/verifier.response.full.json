In particular, whether S_P is nowhere dense does not depend on the root.\\nProof. S_P is saturated. By Lemma 1, cl(S_P) and Int(cl(S_P)) are saturated. Since \u201cnowhere dense\u201d means Int(cl(S_P))=\\\\emptyset, the statement is root\u2011invariant. \u220e\"},\"output_update\":{\"action\":\"append\",\"content\":\"Theorem (Root\u2011invariance of nowhere density). Fix D\u22652. Let P be any property of unrooted graphs and let S_P={ (G,\\\\rho) in G_{\\\\bullet,D} : G has P }. Then S_P is nowhere dense in (G_{\\\\bullet,D},d_\\\\bullet) if and only if Int(cl(S_P))=\\\\emptyset, and this condition does not depend on the root: equivalently, whether S_P is nowhere dense is independent of how graphs are rooted.\\n\\nProof. S_P is saturated: if G has P, then (G,\\\\rho) in S_P for every vertex \\\\rho. For any saturated S, its closure cl(S) and interior Int(cl(S)) are also saturated: given (G,\\\\rho) in cl(S) and any vertex u, for each radius t choose r\u226bdist(\\\\rho,u)+t and (H_r,\\\\sigma_r) in S whose r\u2011ball at the root matches that of (G,\\\\rho); transport the root to the image of u to obtain (H_r,u_r) in S with B_t(H_r,u_r)\u2245B_t(G,u). Hence (G,u) in cl(S). It follows that Int(cl(S)) is saturated as well. Therefore the condition Int(cl(S_P))=\\\\emptyset (the definition of \u201cnowhere dense\u201d) is root\u2011invariant. \u220e\\n\\nDiscussion. This resolves the conjecture for nowhere density unconditionally in the rooted local topology: for any unrooted property P, the nowhere\u2011dense status of S_P is a root\u2011free notion. The meagre part of the conjecture requires additional structure (e.g., a comeagre domain of canonical re\u2011rootings or a category\u2011preserving selector) and is left for future work.\"}}",
