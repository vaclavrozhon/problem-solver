{"feedback_md":"Overall: good conceptual progress on formalizing “root‑invariance,” but key gaps remain. The nowhere‑dense part can be settled cleanly and unconditionally; the meagre part still lacks a fully rigorous, general argument.\n\nStrengths\n- P2 and P3 correctly focus on saturation: for an unrooted property P, S_P is saturated (closed under re‑rooting). P3’s Lemma A (closure of a saturated set is saturated) gives a short, correct route to root‑invariance of nowhere density. This resolves the ND half of the conjecture in the rooted space without invoking any unrooted metric.\n- P2’s Proposition A1 is a valid root‑free characterization of nowhere density for saturated sets, using the clopen cylinder basis of the local topology. This complements P3’s approach.\n\nIssues to fix\n- P1’s Theorem A proof (equivalence via the quotient U_q) uses the incorrect step “π(C′) is open (by definition).” In general, images of open sets under a quotient map need not be open; π(C′) is open iff π^{-1}(π(C′)) is open, which typically fails because saturations of cylinders need not be open. The meagre equivalence in Theorem B relies on this and thus is not yet justified.\n- P2’s Proposition B2 (saturation of a nowhere‑dense set is meagre) hinges on Lemma B1 (Good_∞ is comeagre) and on a library of degree‑preserving “marker” gadgets, especially in the Δ= D case. These gadgets are only sketched; a complete, uniform construction and a proof that each Bad_{m,ℓ} is nowhere dense are still needed.\n- P3’s non‑emptiness criterion for cylinders in the Δ= D space is overstated. Vertices at distance < r can have degree < D in F; adding edges from such vertices to outside does not alter B_r, so “every vertex at distance < r has deg D” is not necessary. Avoid relying on that claim.\n- Metric off‑by‑one: the statement “d<2^{-r} iff B_r agrees” in the manuscript is inaccurate. If kept, it must be corrected as P3 notes.\n\nWhat is solid now\n- The ND part of the conjecture: If S is saturated, then cl(S) and Int(cl(S)) are saturated; hence S is nowhere dense iff Int(cl(S))=∅, a condition independent of the root. Applied to S_P, this proves root‑invariance for nowhere density unconditionally in the rooted space.\n\nNext steps\n1) Meagre part, general framework: Either (a) finish P2’s Good_∞ construction with explicit degree‑preserving markers (≤D and =D, even/odd) and prove that the countable re‑rooting partial homeomorphisms cover a comeagre set; then complete Proposition B2 rigorously; or (b) build a Borel/continuous selector on a comeagre domain (unique marked root) to obtain a category‑preserving isomorphism between a comeagre subset of U_q and a comeagre subset of the rooted space, yielding meagre equivalence for Baire sets.\n2) Provide a clean non‑emptiness lemma only in the form needed (≤D is straightforward; treat =D carefully or omit unless needed).\n3) Remove or restate P1’s quotient‑equivalence claims to avoid relying on “π(C) open.” If you keep the quotient viewpoint, be explicit about using only saturated open sets.\n4) Keep P3’s metric corrections and add them (optionally) to proofs.md once the off‑by‑one is corrected in the main text.\n","summary_md":"Settled: Nowhere density is root‑invariant for all unrooted properties P.

For an unrooted property P and S_P={ (G,\\rho) in G_{\\bullet,D} : G has P }, does the nowhere‑dense/meagre status of S_P depend on root choices?\n\nAgreed notions\n- Saturated sets: S is saturated if (G,\\rho) in S implies (G,u) in S for every vertex u of G. For unrooted P, S_P is saturated.\n- Cylinders form a clopen base in the local topology, hence nowhere density can be witnessed by refining cylinders.\n\nKey lemma (settled). If S is saturated, then cl(S) and Int(cl(S)) are saturated. Sketch: For (G,\\rho) in cl(S) and u in V(G), for each t pick r≫dist(\\rho,u)+t and (H_r,\\sigma_r) in S with B_r matching at the root; transport the root to the image of u and use saturation to see (H_r,u_r) in S with B_t(H_r,u_r)≅B_t(G,u). Thus (G,u) in cl(S). Interior of a saturated set is saturated because open sets are unions of cylinders and re‑rooting preserves membership.\n\nConsequence (nowhere density is root‑invariant). S is nowhere dense iff Int(cl(S))=\\emptyset. For saturated S this condition is root‑free; applied to S_P it proves the ND half of the conjecture.\n\nCaveat on quotients. Let π: G_{\\bullet,D}→U_q be the quotient by forgetting the root. In general, π maps open cylinders to sets whose preimages are the saturations of those cylinders, which need not be open; π(C) need not be open. Thus arguments that rely on π being open are invalid. Any quotient‑based comparison must work with saturated open sets only, or with a selector on a comeagre domain.\n\nMeagre part: current route and plan. Define Good_∞ (comeagre local rigidity): around the root and finitely many steps, distinct neighbors are eventually distinguishable. Using (degree‑preserving) markers, each Bad_{m,\\ell} should be nowhere dense; this yields a comeagre domain on which countably many partial re‑rooting homeomorphisms generate all finite re‑rootings. Then: the saturation of a nowhere‑dense set is meagre (countable union of homeomorphic images of a nowhere‑dense set plus a meagre exceptional set). This would imply meagreness for many S_P constructed as saturations of root‑local nowhere‑dense witnesses. Completing this requires explicit marker gadgets in both Δ≤D and Δ= D (odd/even cases).\n\nOpen items\n- Finish the Good_∞ construction with uniform markers in Δ= D and write the proof that each Bad_{m,\\ell} is nowhere dense.\n- Either produce a Borel/continuous selector on a comeagre domain (unique marked root) to compare meagreness between U_q and the rooted space, or construct a counterexample showing full meagre equivalence can fail without extra structure.\n- Optional: record the metric off‑by‑one correction and the safe non‑emptiness criterion for cylinders (≤D is straightforward)."},"proofs_update":{"action":"append","content":"Definitions. A subset S of G_{\\bullet,D} is saturated if for every (G,\\rho) in S and every vertex u of G, (G,u) is also in S.\n\nLemma 1 (closure and interior of saturated sets are saturated). Let S be saturated. Then cl(S) and Int(cl(S)) are saturated.\nProof. We first show cl(S) is saturated. Fix (G,\\rho) in cl(S) and u in V(G). For each integer t≥0, choose r≥t+dist_G(\\rho,u). By (G,\\rho) in cl(S), there exists (H_r,\\sigma_r) in S and a root‑preserving isomorphism \\phi_r: B_r(G,\\rho)→B_r(H_r,\\sigma_r). Let u_r=\\phi_r(u). Since S is saturated and (H_r,\\sigma_r) in S, also (H_r,u_r) in S. Moreover, B_t(G,u)≅B_t(H_r,u_r) because t≤r−dist(\\rho,u). Hence for every t there is an element of S whose t‑ball at the root matches B_t(G,u); thus (G,u) in cl(S). Therefore cl(S) is saturated.\nFor the interior, note that Int(cl(S)) is a union of open sets contained in cl(S), and re‑rooting preserves membership in cl(S) by the first part. Hence Int(cl(S)) is saturated. ∎\n\nTheorem 2 (root‑invariance of nowhere density). Let P be any property of unrooted graphs and S_P={ (G,\\rho) in G_{\\bullet,D} : G has P }.

In particular, whether S_P is nowhere dense does not depend on the root.\nProof. S_P is saturated. By Lemma 1, cl(S_P) and Int(cl(S_P)) are saturated. Since “nowhere dense” means Int(cl(S_P))=\\emptyset, the statement is root‑invariant. ∎"},"output_update":{"action":"append","content":"Theorem (Root‑invariance of nowhere density). Fix D≥2.

S_P is saturated: if G has P, then (G,\\rho) in S_P for every vertex \\rho. For any saturated S, its closure cl(S) and interior Int(cl(S)) are also saturated: given (G,\\rho) in cl(S) and any vertex u, for each radius t choose r≫dist(\\rho,u)+t and (H_r,\\sigma_r) in S whose r‑ball at the root matches that of (G,\\rho); transport the root to the image of u to obtain (H_r,u_r) in S with B_t(H_r,u_r)≅B_t(G,u). Hence (G,u) in cl(S). It follows that Int(cl(S)) is saturated as well. Therefore the condition Int(cl(S_P))=\\emptyset (the definition of “nowhere dense”) is root‑invariant. ∎\n\nDiscussion. This resolves the conjecture for nowhere density unconditionally in the rooted local topology: for any unrooted property P, the nowhere‑dense status of S_P is a root‑free notion.
