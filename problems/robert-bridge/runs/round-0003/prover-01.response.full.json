Specifically, the interior of the closure might not be saturated, especially in topological spaces with group actions. The interior only stays saturated if the group action is continuous and a homeomorphism. Rerooting isn't universally defined globally; it\u2019s local.

          "text": "{\"content\":\"Ideas\\n- The current notes assert a \u201csettled\u201d key lemma: for saturated S, both cl(S) and Int(cl(S)) are saturated. The first part (closure is saturated) is correct; the second (interior of closure is saturated) is not justified and, in this topology, cannot be taken for granted. You do not need it to settle the nowhere\u2011dense part. A safer route is via the cylinder characterization and a rigorous rooted\u2013unrooted quotient framework.\\n- I recommend introducing the unrooted quotient U_q of the rooted space R:=G_{\\\\bullet,D} by forgetting the root. Equip U_q with the quotient topology: W\u2286U_q is open iff \u03c0^{-1}(W) is open in R. For any unrooted property P, write T_P\u2286U_q for graphs with P, and S_P=\u03c0^{-1}(T_P). This aligns precisely with how your sets arise and avoids pitfalls with the ad hoc unrooted local metric.\\n\\nRigorous lemmas and corrections\\n- Lemma A (cylinders are clopen; ND via cylinders). For any rooted r\u2011ball F, the cylinder C(F):=G_{\\\\bullet}^{F} is clopen in R (ultrametric). A set S\u2286R is nowhere dense iff for every r\u2011ball F there exists an r\u2032\u2011ball F\u2032 with C(F\u2032)\u2286C(F)\\\\S. This is standard and should be stated and used systematically.\\n- Lemma B (closure of saturated sets is saturated). If S\u2286R is saturated, then cl(S) is saturated: for (G,\u03c1)\u2208cl(S) and u\u2208V(G), fix t and choose r\u226bdist(\u03c1,u)+t and (H_r,\u03c3_r)\u2208S with B_r(H_r,\u03c3_r)\u2245B_r(G,\u03c1). Map u to u_r; by saturation (H_r,u_r)\u2208S and B_t(H_r,u_r)\u2245B_t(G,u), hence (G,u)\u2208cl(S).\\n- Warning: Int(cl(S)) need not be saturated in general; your proof sketch \u201copen sets are unions of cylinders and re\u2011rooting preserves membership\u201d is not valid, since re\u2011rooting does not preserve belonging to a given cylinder. Avoid using this claim.\\n\\nRoot\u2013unroot equivalence for nowhere denseness\\nTheorem ND. Let P be any property of unrooted graphs. With U_q the quotient and \u03c0:R\u2192U_q, S_P is nowhere dense in R iff T_P is nowhere dense in U_q.\\nProof.\\n(\u21d2) Let O\u2286U_q be nonempty open. Then \u03c0^{-1}(O) is nonempty open in R, so contains a cylinder C(F). Since S_P is nowhere dense, there is a cylinder C(F\u2032)\u2286C(F) with C(F\u2032)\u2229S_P=\u2205. Then \u03c0(C(F\u2032)) is open, \u03c0(C(F\u2032))\u2286O, and \u03c0(C(F\u2032))\u2229T_P=\u2205 (because S_P=\u03c0^{-1}(T_P) and S_P saturated). Hence T_P is nowhere dense.\\n(\u21d0) Let C(F) be a nonempty cylinder in R. Then O:=\u03c0(C(F)) is open in U_q. Since T_P is nowhere dense, there exists nonempty open W\u2286O with W\u2229T_P=\u2205. Then \u03c0^{-1}(W) is nonempty open in C(F), hence contains a cylinder C(F\u2032) with C(F\u2032)\u2229S_P=\u2205. Thus S_P is nowhere dense.\\n\\nMeagre equivalence (with Baire property)\\nTheorem M. If T_P has the Baire property in U_q, then S_P is meagre in R iff T_P is meagre in U_q.\\nProof.\\n- If T_P is meagre, write T_P=\u22c3_n N_n with N_n nowhere dense. By Theorem ND, \u03c0^{-1}(N_n) is nowhere dense in R, hence S_P=\u22c3_n \u03c0^{-1}(N_n) is meagre.\\n- Conversely, suppose S_P is meagre while T_P is not. By the Baire property, there is nonempty open U\u2286U_q with T_P comeagre in U, so T_P\u2229U=\u22c2_n O_n with O_n open dense in U. Then \u03c0^{-1}(U) is nonempty open in R and \u03c0^{-1}(O_n) is open and dense in \u03c0^{-1}(U): density follows because every nonempty open subset of R contains a cylinder C, and \u03c0(C) is open in U_q, so O_n\u2229\u03c0(C)\u2260\u2205, hence C\u2229\u03c0^{-1}(O_n)\u2260\u2205. Therefore \u03c0^{-1}(T_P\u2229U)=\u22c2_n \u03c0^{-1}(O_n) is comeagre in \u03c0^{-1}(U), contradicting meagreness of S_P. Hence T_P is meagre.\\n\\nAudit of current writeup (specific issues and fixes)\\n1) Conjecture phrasing. As written, \u201cdoes not depend on the choice of the root \u03c1\u201d is ambiguous because S_P already ignores \u03c1. State and prove Theorems ND and M relative to the unrooted quotient U_q. This precisely captures \u201croot\u2011invariance of smallness.\u201d\\n2) Lemma 13 (nonemptiness). The second bullet is only a sufficient condition. Please include a correct nonemptiness criterion you actually need (for \u0394\u2264D: existence of at least one boundary vertex with spare degree ensures an infinite connected extension). Avoid overstatements about necessity in \u0394=D unless proven.\\n3) Cylinder characterization. Elevate Lemma A to a stated tool; use it in all ND arguments (Theorems 14\u201317) to justify \u201crefine an r\u2011ball to avoid the property.\u201d\\n4) Even D regular graphs. Parity implies no bridges at all in D\u2011regular graphs when D is even (every cut has even size). Adjust Theorem 14 to exclude \u0394= D even in (ii), and refine Theorem 16 accordingly (the set \u201chas a 2\u2011way infinite bridge\u201d is empty in \u0394= D even).\\n5) Theorem 16 (meagre but not nowhere dense). Provide full details:\\n   - Nowhere dense decomposition: for each k, show the set \u201chas a 2\u2011way infinite bridge with midpoint at distance \u2264k\u201d is nowhere dense by attaching short cycles to all edges within distance \u2264k in a subcylinder.\\n   - Density: given any cylinder, complete it and, far outside, splice two disjoint infinite components and connect them by a single edge; verify degree constraints (\u0394\u2264D). Conclude the union over k is dense, hence the property is not nowhere dense.\\n6) Theorem 17 (\u03c7\u2032=D). Replace \u201cparity gadgets\u201d with an explicit finite class\u20112 subgraph H of max degree \u2264D embedded inside a cylinder; argue every extension contains H; cite concrete examples for each D (e.g., K_{D+1} for even D; known class\u20112 D\u2011regular graphs for odd D, such as Petersen for D=3 and standard constructions for general odd D).\\n7) Theorem 4 (weak 6\u2011flows). The finite satisfiability step must be corrected: your augmented finite graphs G_r may have bridges, so Seymour\u2019s 6\u2011flow theorem is not directly applicable. Either adjust the augmentation to preserve bridgelessness where invoked, or cite a finite result ensuring the local Boolean system admits solutions on G_r (and explain the compatibility across r). Provide exact references for [7] and [4].\\n8) Quotient caveat. The note \u201c\u03c0(C) need not be open\u201d conflates the quotient U_q with the unrooted local metric space. In U_q (by definition), \u03c0 maps cylinders to open sets. If you also want to discuss the metric d_\u2218 on unrooted graphs, separate that discussion and do not rely on \u03c0 being open there.\\n\\nExamples and sanity checks\\n- Use the cylinder\u2011based ND equivalence to re\u2011prove Theorem 14(i) rigorously: in \u0394\u2264D, any nonempty cylinder has a boundary vertex with spare degree; attach a leaf to force a 1\u2011way infinite bridge; this witnesses nowhere denseness.\\n- In \u0394= D odd, sketch a concrete finite gadget F\u2032 that saturates all but one boundary stub and argue any D\u2011regular completion must use exactly one crossing edge at a designated boundary vertex, which is then a bridge. Supply the completion lemma to ensure C(F\u2032)\u2260\u2205.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Insert Theorems ND and M (with the precise quotient U_q and the proofs above). This resolves the conjecture for nowhere denseness unconditionally and for meagreness under the Baire property assumption (which holds for all Borel/analytic P).\\n- Strengthen Lemma 13 with a clean extension lemma you actually use, and systematically rely on Lemma A in ND proofs.\\n- Repair scope and parity issues in Theorems 14\u201316, and supply the missing gadget constructions and degree bookkeeping.\\n- Fix the compactness argument in Theorem 4 by citing an applicable finite result or modifying the construction so that the local constraints are consistent on each G_r.\"}",
