Ideas
- The current notes assert a “settled” key lemma: for saturated S, both cl(S) and Int(cl(S)) are saturated. The first part (closure is saturated) is correct; the second (interior of closure is saturated) is not justified and, in this topology, cannot be taken for granted. You do not need it to settle the nowhere‑dense part. A safer route is via the cylinder characterization and a rigorous rooted–unrooted quotient framework.
- I recommend introducing the unrooted quotient U_q of the rooted space R:=G_{\bullet,D} by forgetting the root. Equip U_q with the quotient topology: W⊆U_q is open iff π^{-1}(W) is open in R. For any unrooted property P, write T_P⊆U_q for graphs with P, and S_P=π^{-1}(T_P). This aligns precisely with how your sets arise and avoids pitfalls with the ad hoc unrooted local metric.

Rigorous lemmas and corrections
- Lemma A (cylinders are clopen; ND via cylinders). For any rooted r‑ball F, the cylinder C(F):=G_{\bullet}^{F} is clopen in R (ultrametric). A set S⊆R is nowhere dense iff for every r‑ball F there exists an r′‑ball F′ with C(F′)⊆C(F)\S. This is standard and should be stated and used systematically.
- Lemma B (closure of saturated sets is saturated). If S⊆R is saturated, then cl(S) is saturated: for (G,ρ)∈cl(S) and u∈V(G), fix t and choose r≫dist(ρ,u)+t and (H_r,σ_r)∈S with B_r(H_r,σ_r)≅B_r(G,ρ). Map u to u_r; by saturation (H_r,u_r)∈S and B_t(H_r,u_r)≅B_t(G,u), hence (G,u)∈cl(S).
- Warning: Int(cl(S)) need not be saturated in general; your proof sketch “open sets are unions of cylinders and re‑rooting preserves membership” is not valid, since re‑rooting does not preserve belonging to a given cylinder. Avoid using this claim.

Root–unroot equivalence for nowhere denseness
Theorem ND. Let P be any property of unrooted graphs. With U_q the quotient and π:R→U_q, S_P is nowhere dense in R iff T_P is nowhere dense in U_q.
Proof.
(⇒) Let O⊆U_q be nonempty open. Then π^{-1}(O) is nonempty open in R, so contains a cylinder C(F). Since S_P is nowhere dense, there is a cylinder C(F′)⊆C(F) with C(F′)∩S_P=∅. Then π(C(F′)) is open, π(C(F′))⊆O, and π(C(F′))∩T_P=∅ (because S_P=π^{-1}(T_P) and S_P saturated). Hence T_P is nowhere dense.
(⇐) Let C(F) be a nonempty cylinder in R. Then O:=π(C(F)) is open in U_q. Since T_P is nowhere dense, there exists nonempty open W⊆O with W∩T_P=∅. Then π^{-1}(W) is nonempty open in C(F), hence contains a cylinder C(F′) with C(F′)∩S_P=∅. Thus S_P is nowhere dense.

Meagre equivalence (with Baire property)
Theorem M. If T_P has the Baire property in U_q, then S_P is meagre in R iff T_P is meagre in U_q.
Proof.
- If T_P is meagre, write T_P=⋃_n N_n with N_n nowhere dense. By Theorem ND, π^{-1}(N_n) is nowhere dense in R, hence S_P=⋃_n π^{-1}(N_n) is meagre.
- Conversely, suppose S_P is meagre while T_P is not. By the Baire property, there is nonempty open U⊆U_q with T_P comeagre in U, so T_P∩U=⋂_n O_n with O_n open dense in U. Then π^{-1}(U) is nonempty open in R and π^{-1}(O_n) is open and dense in π^{-1}(U): density follows because every nonempty open subset of R contains a cylinder C, and π(C) is open in U_q, so O_n∩π(C)≠∅, hence C∩π^{-1}(O_n)≠∅. Therefore π^{-1}(T_P∩U)=⋂_n π^{-1}(O_n) is comeagre in π^{-1}(U), contradicting meagreness of S_P. Hence T_P is meagre.

Audit of current writeup (specific issues and fixes)
1) Conjecture phrasing. As written, “does not depend on the choice of the root ρ” is ambiguous because S_P already ignores ρ. State and prove Theorems ND and M relative to the unrooted quotient U_q. This precisely captures “root‑invariance of smallness.”
2) Lemma 13 (nonemptiness). The second bullet is only a sufficient condition. Please include a correct nonemptiness criterion you actually need (for Δ≤D: existence of at least one boundary vertex with spare degree ensures an infinite connected extension). Avoid overstatements about necessity in Δ=D unless proven.
3) Cylinder characterization. Elevate Lemma A to a stated tool; use it in all ND arguments (Theorems 14–17) to justify “refine an r‑ball to avoid the property.”
4) Even D regular graphs. Parity implies no bridges at all in D‑regular graphs when D is even (every cut has even size). Adjust Theorem 14 to exclude Δ= D even in (ii), and refine Theorem 16 accordingly (the set “has a 2‑way infinite bridge” is empty in Δ= D even).
5) Theorem 16 (meagre but not nowhere dense). Provide full details:
   - Nowhere dense decomposition: for each k, show the set “has a 2‑way infinite bridge with midpoint at distance ≤k” is nowhere dense by attaching short cycles to all edges within distance ≤k in a subcylinder.
   - Density: given any cylinder, complete it and, far outside, splice two disjoint infinite components and connect them by a single edge; verify degree constraints (Δ≤D). Conclude the union over k is dense, hence the property is not nowhere dense.
6) Theorem 17 (χ′=D). Replace “parity gadgets” with an explicit finite class‑2 subgraph H of max degree ≤D embedded inside a cylinder; argue every extension contains H; cite concrete examples for each D (e.g., K_{D+1} for even D; known class‑2 D‑regular graphs for odd D, such as Petersen for D=3 and standard constructions for general odd D).
7) Theorem 4 (weak 6‑flows). The finite satisfiability step must be corrected: your augmented finite graphs G_r may have bridges, so Seymour’s 6‑flow theorem is not directly applicable. Either adjust the augmentation to preserve bridgelessness where invoked, or cite a finite result ensuring the local Boolean system admits solutions on G_r (and explain the compatibility across r). Provide exact references for [7] and [4].
8) Quotient caveat. The note “π(C) need not be open” conflates the quotient U_q with the unrooted local metric space. In U_q (by definition), π maps cylinders to open sets. If you also want to discuss the metric d_∘ on unrooted graphs, separate that discussion and do not rely on π being open there.

Examples and sanity checks
- Use the cylinder‑based ND equivalence to re‑prove Theorem 14(i) rigorously: in Δ≤D, any nonempty cylinder has a boundary vertex with spare degree; attach a leaf to force a 1‑way infinite bridge; this witnesses nowhere denseness.
- In Δ= D odd, sketch a concrete finite gadget F′ that saturates all but one boundary stub and argue any D‑regular completion must use exactly one crossing edge at a designated boundary vertex, which is then a bridge. Supply the completion lemma to ensure C(F′)≠∅.

Next steps
- Insert Theorems ND and M (with the precise quotient U_q and the proofs above). This resolves the conjecture for nowhere denseness unconditionally and for meagreness under the Baire property assumption (which holds for all Borel/analytic P).
- Strengthen Lemma 13 with a clean extension lemma you actually use, and systematically rely on Lemma A in ND proofs.
- Repair scope and parity issues in Theorems 14–16, and supply the missing gadget constructions and degree bookkeeping.
- Fix the compactness argument in Theorem 4 by citing an applicable finite result or modifying the construction so that the local constraints are consistent on each G_r.
