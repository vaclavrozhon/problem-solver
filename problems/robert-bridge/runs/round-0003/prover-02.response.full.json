We also record a precise, root\u2011free cylinder criterion that is equivalent to nowhere density for saturated sets S_P=\u03c0^{-1}(P).\\n- For the meagre half we isolate a clean reduction: saturation along paths of length k of a nowhere\u2011dense set is meagre provided the \u201cambiguity\u201d set Amb_k (there exists a vertex within distance \u2264k with two neighbors that are globally rooted\u2011isomorphic) is meagre. We give a covering lemma expressing Sat_k(N) as a countable union of homeomorphic images of N plus the exceptional Amb_k. This makes the missing piece explicit and decoupled.\\n- We correct a flaw from earlier rounds: sets Bad_{m,\u2113} (two neighbors with equal \u2113\u2011balls) can have nonempty interior; thus they are not nowhere dense in general. Hence the earlier plan to derive comeagre \u201clocal rigidity\u201d from these sets fails as stated.\\n\\nBasic lemmas about saturation (rigorous)\\nLemma 1 (closure and interior preserve saturation). Let S\u2282G_{\u2022,D} be saturated, i.e., (G,\u03c1)\u2208S and u\u2208V(G) imply (G,u)\u2208S. Then cl(S) and Int(cl(S)) are saturated.\\nProof. Fix (G,\u03c1)\u2208cl(S) and u\u2208V(G), and let t\u2208\u2115. Choose r\u2265t+dist(\u03c1,u). There exists (H,\u03c3)\u2208S with B_r(H,\u03c3)\u2245B_r(G,\u03c1). Let f be a root\u2011preserving isomorphism B_r(H,\u03c3)\u2192B_r(G,\u03c1), and set x=f^{-1}(u). Saturation implies (H,x)\u2208S. For any t\u2032\u2264t we have B_{t\u2032}(H,x)\u2245B_{t\u2032}(G,u), hence every neighborhood of (G,u) meets S. Therefore (G,u)\u2208cl(S). Since interior is a union of open sets and re\u2011rooting preserves membership in saturated open sets (unions of cylinders), Int(cl(S)) is saturated. \u220e\\nCorollary 2 (root\u2011invariance for nowhere density). For a saturated S, S is nowhere dense iff Int(cl(S))=\u2205. In particular, for any unrooted P, the nowhere\u2011dense status of S_P is independent of how graphs are rooted.\\n\\nRoot\u2011free characterization of nowhere density (rigorous)\\nProposition 3. Let P be a property of unrooted graphs and S_P={ (G,\u03c1): G has P }. The following are equivalent:\\n(i) S_P is nowhere dense in G_{\u2022,D}.\\n(ii) For every rooted r\u2011ball F there exists an extension r\u2032\u2011ball F\u2032 with G_{\u2022}^{F\u2032}\u2282G_{\u2022}^{F} and such that every D\u2011bounded connected graph H with some vertex v satisfying B_{r\u2032}(H,v)\u2245F\u2032 fails P.\\nProof. (i\u21d2ii) By the cylinder characterization, for each F there is F\u2032 with G_{\u2022}^{F\u2032}\u2282G_{\u2022}^{F}\u2216S_P. For (H,v) extending F\u2032 we have (H,v)\u2209S_P, hence H\u2209P. (ii\u21d2i) If (ii) holds then for every cylinder G_{\u2022}^{F} there exists a subcylinder disjoint from S_P, so S_P is nowhere dense. \u220e\\nRemark. This furnishes a practical, root\u2011free way to witness nowhere density, and subsumes the constructions in the notes for bridges, cut vertices, and \u03c7\u2032.\\n\\nPartial re\u2011rooting homeomorphisms (templates)\\nDefinition 4 (1\u2011step template and map). Fix integers s\u22651 and \u2113\u22650. Let F be a rooted s\u2011ball and U a rooted \u2113\u2011ball. Suppose that in F the root has a unique neighbor u_F whose \u2113\u2011ball B_\u2113(F,u_F)\u2245U (uniqueness is verified inside B_{max(\u2113+1,s)}(F)). The domain Dom(\u03b8) is the clopen cylinder of those (G,\u03c1) with B_s(G,\u03c1)\u2245F. Define \u03c4_\u03b8:Dom(\u03b8)\u2192G_{\u2022,D} by \u03c4_\u03b8(G,\u03c1)=(G,u), where u is the unique neighbor of \u03c1 whose \u2113\u2011ball equals U. Then \u03c4_\u03b8 is a homeomorphism onto its image, with inverse given by the reversed template (use the corresponding finite witness around u).\\nProof. On Dom(\u03b8), \u03c4_\u03b8 and its inverse are determined by finite isomorphism types, hence continuous, bijective, and open between clopen sets; thus a homeomorphism. \u220e\\nDefinition 5 (k\u2011step template). A k\u2011step template \u0398 is a sequence (\u03b8_1,\u2026,\u03b8_k) of 1\u2011step templates such that the image cylinder of \u03b8_i equals the domain cylinder of \u03b8_{i+1}. The composition \u03c4_\u0398=\u03c4_{\u03b8_k}\u2218\u22ef\u2218\u03c4_{\u03b8_1} is a homeomorphism between clopen sets Dom(\u0398) and Im(\u0398).\\nObservation.

Then\\nSat_k(N) \u2286 Amb_k \u222a \u22c3_{\u0398\u2208\ud835\udcaf_k} \u03c4_\u0398(N\u2229Dom(\u0398)),\\nwhere \ud835\udcaf_k is the countable family of all k\u2011step templates. In particular, if Amb_k is meagre, then Sat_k(N) is meagre.\\nProof. Take (G,\u03c3)\u2208Sat_k(N). Then there is a path \u03c1=x_0,x_1,\u2026,x_k=\u03c3 with (G,\u03c1)\u2208N. If for some j the vertex x_{j} has two neighbors with globally isomorphic rooted types, then (G,\u03c1)\u2208Amb_j and hence (G,\u03c3)\u2208Amb_k (since \u201cthere exists such w within distance \u2264k\u201d holds). Otherwise, for each step j the next vertex x_{j+1} is uniquely identifiable among neighbors of x_j by its rooted isomorphism type; by compactness, there exists finite \u2113_j such that the \u2113_j\u2011balls around distinct neighbors of x_j are pairwise non\u2011isomorphic. Let s large enough so B_s(G,x_j) records these distinctions for all j. The k\u2011step template \u0398 built from the finite witnesses around x_0,\u2026,x_{k\u22121} (with parameters s,\u2113_j) is defined at (G,\u03c1) and \u03c4_\u0398(G,\u03c1)=(G,\u03c3). Thus (G,\u03c3)\u2208\u03c4_\u0398(N\u2229Dom(\u0398)). The union over countably many \u0398 covers all such points. Finally, each \u03c4_\u0398 is a homeomorphism, hence maps nowhere dense sets to nowhere dense sets; a countable union of nowhere dense sets is meagre. \u220e\\nCorollary 7 (conditional saturation\u2011meagreness). If Amb_k is meagre for every k, then for every nowhere dense N we have Sat(N)=\u22c3_{k}Sat_k(N) meagre. Consequently, for any property P that admits a nowhere\u2011dense transversal N\u2282S_P with S_P=Sat(N), the meagre status of S_P is root\u2011invariant.\\n\\nExamples and checks\\n- 2\u2011way infinite bridges (Theorem 16). Let P be \u201chas a 2\u2011way infinite bridge.\u201d For each k, let N_k be the nowhere\u2011dense set of rootings where the r\u2011ball witnesses that some bridge meets B_k and separates two infinite components (the usual cylinder construction works in both \u0394\u2264D and \u0394=D). Then S_P=Sat(\u22c3_k N_k). By Corollary 7, if Amb_k is meagre for all k (see Obstacles), we recover meagreness of S_P and its root\u2011invariance. Independently of Amb_k, the original argument in the notes already writes S_P as a countable union of nowhere\u2011dense sets by specifying where the bridge meets the root ball; hence root\u2011invariance holds here unconditionally.\\n- Bad_{m,\u2113} is not nowhere dense. Fix m=0,\u2113=1. Let F be a rooted ball where the root has two leaf neighbors u,v and all other neighbors (if any) lie beyond distance \u22653. For r\u22652 this F has G_{\u2022}^{F}\u2282Bad_{0,1}. Thus Bad_{m,\u2113} can have nonempty interior; the earlier plan to prove Good_\u221e comeagre via Bad_{m,\u2113} fails.\\n\\nObstacles (what remains to prove for the meagre half)\\n- The missing piece is Amb_k meagre. A naive attempt to force uniqueness of neighbor rooted types via boundary decorations fails because a global rooted isomorphism (G,u)\u2245(G,v) is not obliged to act trivially on the r\u2011ball around \u03c1; it may move the \u201cboundary\u201d determined by \u03c1 elsewhere. Hence decorations anchored relative to \u03c1 do not a priori block such isomorphisms.\\n- It is tempting to argue that \u201cgraphs with a pair of globally isomorphic neighbor roots\u201d are meagre because generic bounded\u2011degree graphs are rigid. However, formalizing this in the local (ultrametric) topology is nontrivial: an automorphism at u,v need not reflect a nontrivial automorphism of the rooted graph at \u03c1.\\n\\nNext steps (auditable targets)\\n1) Ambiguity analysis. Define Amb^{glob}={ (G,\u03c1): \u2203 neighbors u\u2260v of \u03c1 with (G,u)\u2245(G,v) }. Prove Amb^{glob} is meagre in G_{\u2022,\u2264D} and in G_{\u2022,=D} for each D\u22653. Strategy: For any cylinder F, extend to F\u2032 so that for every pair of neighbors inside B_m the rooted neighborhoods are made pairwise non\u2011isomorphic via decorations anchored within a bounded radius from each neighbor (placed outside the original cylinder). The key is to ensure that these decorations are intrinsic to (G,u), independent of \u03c1; for \u0394=D, use degree\u2011preserving port gadgets to attach pairwise non\u2011isomorphic finite \u201csignatures.\u201d Carefully handle the case when two neighbors are indistinguishable by any automorphism of the finite neighborhood around them; here pick mutually incompatible signatures along all possible partial isomorphisms (finite in number) from (F,u) to (F,v).\\n2) Formalize port gadgets for \u0394=D. For each label i, construct a finite D\u2011regular graph W_i with a fixed set of t ports of degree D\u22121 (t variable) so that attaching ports to a boundary vertex yields a D\u2011regular extension and W_i are pairwise non\u2011isomorphic as rooted\u2011at\u2011port graphs. Record explicit constructions for even/odd D.\\n3) k\u2011step saturation. Write out the full proof of Lemma 6 for general k (already sketched above) and isolate precisely the exceptional sets Amb_k.\\n4) Special classes. Verify Amb_k meagre on restricted subclasses (e.g., graphs with no cycles inside a sufficiently thick annulus; graphs with bounded automorphism group on large balls). Such results would already suffice to complete the meagre half for many P expressible via local witnesses.\\n\\nSummary\\n- The nowhere\u2011dense half of the conjecture is proved: closures and interiors preserve saturation, and a root\u2011free cylinder criterion (Proposition 3) is equivalent to nowhere density. Thus the status of S_P is independent of the root.\\n- For meagreness we provide a precise reduction (Lemma 6): Sat_k(N) for nowhere\u2011dense N is contained in a countable union of homeomorphic images of N plus the ambiguity set Amb_k. Therefore, establishing that Amb_k is meagre for all k would imply that the saturation of any nowhere\u2011dense set is meagre, yielding the meagre half for all properties P that admit a nowhere\u2011dense transversal.\\n- We identified and corrected a false step from earlier rounds: Bad_{m,\u2113} need not be nowhere dense. The remaining obstacle is to prove Amb_k meagre; we outlined a concrete, checkable plan centered on intrinsic signature gadgets (with degree\u2011preserving ports) to break global rooted isomorphisms of neighbors.\"}",
