Ideas
- We settle rigorously the nowhere‑dense half of the conjecture via saturation. We also record a precise, root‑free cylinder criterion that is equivalent to nowhere density for saturated sets S_P=π^{-1}(P).
- For the meagre half we isolate a clean reduction: saturation along paths of length k of a nowhere‑dense set is meagre provided the “ambiguity” set Amb_k (there exists a vertex within distance ≤k with two neighbors that are globally rooted‑isomorphic) is meagre. We give a covering lemma expressing Sat_k(N) as a countable union of homeomorphic images of N plus the exceptional Amb_k. This makes the missing piece explicit and decoupled.
- We correct a flaw from earlier rounds: sets Bad_{m,ℓ} (two neighbors with equal ℓ‑balls) can have nonempty interior; thus they are not nowhere dense in general. Hence the earlier plan to derive comeagre “local rigidity” from these sets fails as stated.

Basic lemmas about saturation (rigorous)
Lemma 1 (closure and interior preserve saturation). Let S⊂G_{•,D} be saturated, i.e., (G,ρ)∈S and u∈V(G) imply (G,u)∈S. Then cl(S) and Int(cl(S)) are saturated.
Proof. Fix (G,ρ)∈cl(S) and u∈V(G), and let t∈ℕ. Choose r≥t+dist(ρ,u). There exists (H,σ)∈S with B_r(H,σ)≅B_r(G,ρ). Let f be a root‑preserving isomorphism B_r(H,σ)→B_r(G,ρ), and set x=f^{-1}(u). Saturation implies (H,x)∈S. For any t′≤t we have B_{t′}(H,x)≅B_{t′}(G,u), hence every neighborhood of (G,u) meets S. Therefore (G,u)∈cl(S). Since interior is a union of open sets and re‑rooting preserves membership in saturated open sets (unions of cylinders), Int(cl(S)) is saturated. ∎
Corollary 2 (root‑invariance for nowhere density). For a saturated S, S is nowhere dense iff Int(cl(S))=∅. In particular, for any unrooted P, the nowhere‑dense status of S_P is independent of how graphs are rooted.

Root‑free characterization of nowhere density (rigorous)
Proposition 3. Let P be a property of unrooted graphs and S_P={ (G,ρ): G has P }. The following are equivalent:
(i) S_P is nowhere dense in G_{•,D}.
(ii) For every rooted r‑ball F there exists an extension r′‑ball F′ with G_{•}^{F′}⊂G_{•}^{F} and such that every D‑bounded connected graph H with some vertex v satisfying B_{r′}(H,v)≅F′ fails P.
Proof. (i⇒ii) By the cylinder characterization, for each F there is F′ with G_{•}^{F′}⊂G_{•}^{F}∖S_P. For (H,v) extending F′ we have (H,v)∉S_P, hence H∉P. (ii⇒i) If (ii) holds then for every cylinder G_{•}^{F} there exists a subcylinder disjoint from S_P, so S_P is nowhere dense. ∎
Remark. This furnishes a practical, root‑free way to witness nowhere density, and subsumes the constructions in the notes for bridges, cut vertices, and χ′.

Partial re‑rooting homeomorphisms (templates)
Definition 4 (1‑step template and map). Fix integers s≥1 and ℓ≥0. Let F be a rooted s‑ball and U a rooted ℓ‑ball. Suppose that in F the root has a unique neighbor u_F whose ℓ‑ball B_ℓ(F,u_F)≅U (uniqueness is verified inside B_{max(ℓ+1,s)}(F)). The domain Dom(θ) is the clopen cylinder of those (G,ρ) with B_s(G,ρ)≅F. Define τ_θ:Dom(θ)→G_{•,D} by τ_θ(G,ρ)=(G,u), where u is the unique neighbor of ρ whose ℓ‑ball equals U. Then τ_θ is a homeomorphism onto its image, with inverse given by the reversed template (use the corresponding finite witness around u).
Proof. On Dom(θ), τ_θ and its inverse are determined by finite isomorphism types, hence continuous, bijective, and open between clopen sets; thus a homeomorphism. ∎
Definition 5 (k‑step template). A k‑step template Θ is a sequence (θ_1,…,θ_k) of 1‑step templates such that the image cylinder of θ_i equals the domain cylinder of θ_{i+1}. The composition τ_Θ=τ_{θ_k}∘⋯∘τ_{θ_1} is a homeomorphism between clopen sets Dom(Θ) and Im(Θ).
Observation. There are only countably many templates (only countably many finite balls).

Ambiguity sets and a covering lemma
Define Amb_m⊂G_{•,D} by: (G,ρ)∈Amb_m if there exist w with dist(ρ,w)≤m and distinct neighbors u≠v of w such that (G,u)≅(G,v) as rooted graphs. Let NonAmb_m=G_{•,D}∖Amb_m.
Lemma 6 (covering lemma for saturation). Let N⊂G_{•,D} be nowhere dense and k∈ℕ. Then
Sat_k(N) ⊆ Amb_k ∪ ⋃_{Θ∈𝒯_k} τ_Θ(N∩Dom(Θ)),
where 𝒯_k is the countable family of all k‑step templates. In particular, if Amb_k is meagre, then Sat_k(N) is meagre.
Proof. Take (G,σ)∈Sat_k(N). Then there is a path ρ=x_0,x_1,…,x_k=σ with (G,ρ)∈N. If for some j the vertex x_{j} has two neighbors with globally isomorphic rooted types, then (G,ρ)∈Amb_j and hence (G,σ)∈Amb_k (since “there exists such w within distance ≤k” holds). Otherwise, for each step j the next vertex x_{j+1} is uniquely identifiable among neighbors of x_j by its rooted isomorphism type; by compactness, there exists finite ℓ_j such that the ℓ_j‑balls around distinct neighbors of x_j are pairwise non‑isomorphic. Let s large enough so B_s(G,x_j) records these distinctions for all j. The k‑step template Θ built from the finite witnesses around x_0,…,x_{k−1} (with parameters s,ℓ_j) is defined at (G,ρ) and τ_Θ(G,ρ)=(G,σ). Thus (G,σ)∈τ_Θ(N∩Dom(Θ)). The union over countably many Θ covers all such points. Finally, each τ_Θ is a homeomorphism, hence maps nowhere dense sets to nowhere dense sets; a countable union of nowhere dense sets is meagre. ∎
Corollary 7 (conditional saturation‑meagreness). If Amb_k is meagre for every k, then for every nowhere dense N we have Sat(N)=⋃_{k}Sat_k(N) meagre. Consequently, for any property P that admits a nowhere‑dense transversal N⊂S_P with S_P=Sat(N), the meagre status of S_P is root‑invariant.

Examples and checks
- 2‑way infinite bridges (Theorem 16). Let P be “has a 2‑way infinite bridge.” For each k, let N_k be the nowhere‑dense set of rootings where the r‑ball witnesses that some bridge meets B_k and separates two infinite components (the usual cylinder construction works in both Δ≤D and Δ=D). Then S_P=Sat(⋃_k N_k). By Corollary 7, if Amb_k is meagre for all k (see Obstacles), we recover meagreness of S_P and its root‑invariance. Independently of Amb_k, the original argument in the notes already writes S_P as a countable union of nowhere‑dense sets by specifying where the bridge meets the root ball; hence root‑invariance holds here unconditionally.
- Bad_{m,ℓ} is not nowhere dense. Fix m=0,ℓ=1. Let F be a rooted ball where the root has two leaf neighbors u,v and all other neighbors (if any) lie beyond distance ≥3. For r≥2 this F has G_{•}^{F}⊂Bad_{0,1}. Thus Bad_{m,ℓ} can have nonempty interior; the earlier plan to prove Good_∞ comeagre via Bad_{m,ℓ} fails.

Obstacles (what remains to prove for the meagre half)
- The missing piece is Amb_k meagre. A naive attempt to force uniqueness of neighbor rooted types via boundary decorations fails because a global rooted isomorphism (G,u)≅(G,v) is not obliged to act trivially on the r‑ball around ρ; it may move the “boundary” determined by ρ elsewhere. Hence decorations anchored relative to ρ do not a priori block such isomorphisms.
- It is tempting to argue that “graphs with a pair of globally isomorphic neighbor roots” are meagre because generic bounded‑degree graphs are rigid. However, formalizing this in the local (ultrametric) topology is nontrivial: an automorphism at u,v need not reflect a nontrivial automorphism of the rooted graph at ρ.

Next steps (auditable targets)
1) Ambiguity analysis. Define Amb^{glob}={ (G,ρ): ∃ neighbors u≠v of ρ with (G,u)≅(G,v) }. Prove Amb^{glob} is meagre in G_{•,≤D} and in G_{•,=D} for each D≥3. Strategy: For any cylinder F, extend to F′ so that for every pair of neighbors inside B_m the rooted neighborhoods are made pairwise non‑isomorphic via decorations anchored within a bounded radius from each neighbor (placed outside the original cylinder). The key is to ensure that these decorations are intrinsic to (G,u), independent of ρ; for Δ=D, use degree‑preserving port gadgets to attach pairwise non‑isomorphic finite “signatures.” Carefully handle the case when two neighbors are indistinguishable by any automorphism of the finite neighborhood around them; here pick mutually incompatible signatures along all possible partial isomorphisms (finite in number) from (F,u) to (F,v).
2) Formalize port gadgets for Δ=D. For each label i, construct a finite D‑regular graph W_i with a fixed set of t ports of degree D−1 (t variable) so that attaching ports to a boundary vertex yields a D‑regular extension and W_i are pairwise non‑isomorphic as rooted‑at‑port graphs. Record explicit constructions for even/odd D.
3) k‑step saturation. Write out the full proof of Lemma 6 for general k (already sketched above) and isolate precisely the exceptional sets Amb_k.
4) Special classes. Verify Amb_k meagre on restricted subclasses (e.g., graphs with no cycles inside a sufficiently thick annulus; graphs with bounded automorphism group on large balls). Such results would already suffice to complete the meagre half for many P expressible via local witnesses.

Summary
- The nowhere‑dense half of the conjecture is proved: closures and interiors preserve saturation, and a root‑free cylinder criterion (Proposition 3) is equivalent to nowhere density. Thus the status of S_P is independent of the root.
- For meagreness we provide a precise reduction (Lemma 6): Sat_k(N) for nowhere‑dense N is contained in a countable union of homeomorphic images of N plus the ambiguity set Amb_k. Therefore, establishing that Amb_k is meagre for all k would imply that the saturation of any nowhere‑dense set is meagre, yielding the meagre half for all properties P that admit a nowhere‑dense transversal.
- We identified and corrected a false step from earlier rounds: Bad_{m,ℓ} need not be nowhere dense. The remaining obstacle is to prove Amb_k meagre; we outlined a concrete, checkable plan centered on intrinsic signature gadgets (with degree‑preserving ports) to break global rooted isomorphisms of neighbors.
