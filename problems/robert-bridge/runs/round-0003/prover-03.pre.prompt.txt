## Setting

- Fix an integer \(D \ge 2\).
- Let \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) be the space of **countably infinite, connected, rooted graphs** \((G,\rho)\).
- For \((G,\rho) \in \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) and \(r \in \mathbb{N}\), let \(B_r(G,\rho)\) denote the rooted (closed) ball of radius \(r\) about \(\rho\).
- Equip \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) with the **local (Benjamini–Schramm) metric** \(d_\bullet\) given by
  \[
  d_\bullet\big((G,\rho),(H,\sigma)\big)=2^{-R},
  \qquad
  R=\sup\{r\in\mathbb{N} : B_r(G,\rho)\cong B_r(H,\sigma)\}.
  \]
  (Equivalently, \(d_\bullet((G,\rho),(H,\sigma))<2^{-r}\) iff \(B_r(G,\rho)\cong B_r(H,\sigma)\).)
- Degree‑constrained subspaces:
  - \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\): all rooted graphs with \(\Delta(G)\le D\).
  - \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,= D}\): all rooted graphs with \(\Delta(G)= D\).
  We write \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for either of these when the distinction is unimportant.
- A subset \(S\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) is **nowhere dense** if the interior of \(\overline{S}\) is empty. A set is **meagre** (first category) if it is a countable union of nowhere dense sets; its complement is **comeagre**. A property is called **typical** if the corresponding set is comeagre.
- An edge \(e\) of an (unrooted) graph \(G\) is a **bridge** if \(G-e\) has more connected components than \(G\). A bridge is **2‑way infinite** if both components are infinite and **1‑way infinite** otherwise.

# Research Notes



Conjecture (Root‑invariance of smallness). For an unrooted property P and S_P={ (G,\rho) in G_{\bullet,D} : G has P }, does the nowhere‑dense/meagre status of S_P depend on root choices?

Agreed notions
- Saturated sets: S is saturated if (G,\rho) in S implies (G,u) in S for every vertex u of G. For unrooted P, S_P is saturated.
- Cylinders form a clopen base in the local topology, hence nowhere density can be witnessed by refining cylinders.

Key lemma (settled). If S is saturated, then cl(S) and Int(cl(S)) are saturated. Sketch: For (G,\rho) in cl(S) and u in V(G), for each t pick r≫dist(\rho,u)+t and (H_r,\sigma_r) in S with B_r matching at the root; transport the root to the image of u and use saturation to see (H_r,u_r) in S with B_t(H_r,u_r)≅B_t(G,u). Thus (G,u) in cl(S). Interior of a saturated set is saturated because open sets are unions of cylinders and re‑rooting preserves membership.

Consequence (nowhere density is root‑invariant). S is nowhere dense iff Int(cl(S))=\emptyset. For saturated S this condition is root‑free; applied to S_P it proves the ND half of the conjecture.

Caveat on quotients. Let π: G_{\bullet,D}→U_q be the quotient by forgetting the root. In general, π maps open cylinders to sets whose preimages are the saturations of those cylinders, which need not be open; π(C) need not be open. Thus arguments that rely on π being open are invalid. Any quotient‑based comparison must work with saturated open sets only, or with a selector on a comeagre domain.

Meagre part: current route and plan. Define Good_∞ (comeagre local rigidity): around the root and finitely many steps, distinct neighbors are eventually distinguishable. Using (degree‑preserving) markers, each Bad_{m,\ell} should be nowhere dense; this yields a comeagre domain on which countably many partial re‑rooting homeomorphisms generate all finite re‑rootings. Then: the saturation of a nowhere‑dense set is meagre (countable union of homeomorphic images of a nowhere‑dense set plus a meagre exceptional set). This would imply meagreness for many S_P constructed as saturations of root‑local nowhere‑dense witnesses. Completing this requires explicit marker gadgets in both Δ≤D and Δ= D (odd/even cases).

Open items
- Finish the Good_∞ construction with uniform markers in Δ= D and write the proof that each Bad_{m,\ell} is nowhere dense.
- Either produce a Borel/continuous selector on a comeagre domain (unique marked root) to compare meagreness between U_q and the rooted space, or construct a counterexample showing full meagre equivalence can fail without extra structure.
- Optional: record the metric off‑by‑one correction and the safe non‑emptiness criterion for cylinders (≤D is straightforward).

# Main Results



Theorem (Root‑invariance of nowhere density). Fix D≥2. Let P be any property of unrooted graphs and let S_P={ (G,\rho) in G_{\bullet,D} : G has P }. Then S_P is nowhere dense in (G_{\bullet,D},d_\bullet) if and only if Int(cl(S_P))=\emptyset, and this condition does not depend on the root: equivalently, whether S_P is nowhere dense is independent of how graphs are rooted.

Proof. S_P is saturated: if G has P, then (G,\rho) in S_P for every vertex \rho. For any saturated S, its closure cl(S) and interior Int(cl(S)) are also saturated: given (G,\rho) in cl(S) and any vertex u, for each radius t choose r≫dist(\rho,u)+t and (H_r,\sigma_r) in S whose r‑ball at the root matches that of (G,\rho); transport the root to the image of u to obtain (H_r,u_r) in S with B_t(H_r,u_r)≅B_t(G,u). Hence (G,u) in cl(S). It follows that Int(cl(S)) is saturated as well. Therefore the condition Int(cl(S_P))=\emptyset (the definition of “nowhere dense”) is root‑invariant. ∎

Discussion. This resolves the conjecture for nowhere density unconditionally in the rooted local topology: for any unrooted property P, the nowhere‑dense status of S_P is a root‑free notion. The meagre part of the conjecture requires additional structure (e.g., a comeagre domain of canonical re‑rootings or a category‑preserving selector) and is left for future work.


=== Round 2 Summary ===

Proved (now rigorous): for any unrooted property P the set S_P = {(G,ρ): G has P} is saturated, and for any saturated S the closure cl(S) and interior Int(cl(S)) are also saturated (proof by transporting large matching balls and re‑rooting). Hence Int(cl(S_P))=∅ is root‑free, so nowhere density of S_P does not depend on the choice of root — the conjecture is resolved for nowhere density. Caveat: the quotient map that forgets the root need not be open, so meagreness cannot be transferred via a naive quotient argument. Current plan for the meagre part: build a comeagre locally rigid domain Good_∞ via degree‑preserving markers so countably many partial re‑rooting homeomorphisms generate finite re‑rootings there; show each Bad_{m,ℓ} is nowhere dense so Good_∞ is comeagre; conclude that saturations of nowhere‑dense sets are meagre. Remaining technical work: explicit marker gadgets (especially for Δ= D, odd/even) and either a Borel/continuous selector on a comeagre domain or a counterexample.

=== Previous Round Feedback ===

Overall: good conceptual progress on formalizing “root‑invariance,” but key gaps remain. The nowhere‑dense part can be settled cleanly and unconditionally; the meagre part still lacks a fully rigorous, general argument.

Strengths
- P2 and P3 correctly focus on saturation: for an unrooted property P, S_P is saturated (closed under re‑rooting). P3’s Lemma A (closure of a saturated set is saturated) gives a short, correct route to root‑invariance of nowhere density. This resolves the ND half of the conjecture in the rooted space without invoking any unrooted metric.
- P2’s Proposition A1 is a valid root‑free characterization of nowhere density for saturated sets, using the clopen cylinder basis of the local topology. This complements P3’s approach.

Issues to fix
- P1’s Theorem A proof (equivalence via the quotient U_q) uses the incorrect step “π(C′) is open (by definition).” In general, images of open sets under a quotient map need not be open; π(C′) is open iff π^{-1}(π(C′)) is open, which typically fails because saturations of cylinders need not be open. The meagre equivalence in Theorem B relies on this and thus is not yet justified.
- P2’s Proposition B2 (saturation of a nowhere‑dense set is meagre) hinges on Lemma B1 (Good_∞ is comeagre) and on a library of degree‑preserving “marker” gadgets, especially in the Δ= D case. These gadgets are only sketched; a complete, uniform construction and a proof that each Bad_{m,ℓ} is nowhere dense are still needed.
- P3’s non‑emptiness criterion for cylinders in the Δ= D space is overstated. Vertices at distance < r can have degree < D in F; adding edges from such vertices to outside does not alter B_r, so “every vertex at distance < r has deg D” is not necessary. Avoid relying on that claim.
- Metric off‑by‑one: the statement “d<2^{-r} iff B_r agrees” in the manuscript is inaccurate. If kept, it must be corrected as P3 notes.

What is solid now
- The ND part of the conjecture: If S is saturated, then cl(S) and Int(cl(S)) are saturated; hence S is nowhere dense iff Int(cl(S))=∅, a condition independent of the root. Applied to S_P, this proves root‑invariance for nowhere density unconditionally in the rooted space.

Next steps
1) Meagre part, general framework: Either (a) finish P2’s Good_∞ construction with explicit degree‑preserving markers (≤D and =D, even/odd) and prove that the countable re‑rooting partial homeomorphisms cover a comeagre set; then complete Proposition B2 rigorously; or (b) build a Borel/continuous selector on a comeagre domain (unique marked root) to obtain a category‑preserving isomorphism between a comeagre subset of U_q and a comeagre subset of the rooted space, yielding meagre equivalence for Baire sets.
2) Provide a clean non‑emptiness lemma only in the form needed (≤D is straightforward; treat =D carefully or omit unless needed).
3) Remove or restate P1’s quotient‑equivalence claims to avoid relying on “π(C) open.” If you keep the quotient viewpoint, be explicit about using only saturated open sets.
4) Keep P3’s metric corrections and add them (optionally) to proofs.md once the off‑by‑one is corrected in the main text.

### Typical properties of countable graphs: flows and bridges  
*(Extended abstract)*  

**Robert Šámal**\* · **Hadi Zamani**\*

#### Abstract
We have two aims. **First**, we study nowhere‑zero flows in countably infinite graphs, observing the different roles of two types of bridges. **Second**, we study how typical graphs with these types of bridges are. As there is no natural probability measure to use, we turn to an analytic approach: we study which sets are nowhere dense and which are meagre.

In finite graphs, bridges play a crucial role—it is easy to see that every flow assigns value \(0\) to every bridge. It is also known that graphs with a bridge are not typical: both dense random graphs and random regular graphs are bridgeless w.h.p. [3, 1]. We ask how this transfers to countable graphs. In Section 1 we explain differences between bridges and flows and, via compactness, we prove a version of Seymour’s 6‑flow theorem for countable graphs.

In Section 2 we explore nowhere‑dense and meagre sets. This is called for because the usual probabilistic models collapse: extending Erdős–Rényi to countably infinite graphs yields the Rado graph a.s., so we are effectively studying a single graph up to isomorphism. Attempting random regular graphs via the configuration model [1] would require a uniform distribution on perfect matchings of a countable set (e.g., neighbors of the first vertex), which does not exist. Consequently, we turn to Baire category: meagre/co‑meagre sets (also “first/second category”).

### 1. Nowhere‑zero flows for infinite graphs

**Definition 1 (weak flow).**  
Given an orientation \(D\) of a graph \(G\) and an abelian group \(A\), a **weak \(A\)‑flow** is a function \(\varphi:E(G)\to A\) such that **Kirchhoff’s law for each vertex cut** holds:
\[
\forall v\in V(G):\quad \sum_{e\in \delta^-(v)}\varphi(e)=\sum_{e\in \delta^+(v)}\varphi(e).
\]

**Definition 2 (strong flow).**  
Given \(D,G,A\) as above, a **strong \(A\)‑flow** is a function \(\varphi:E(G)\to A\) such that **Kirchhoff’s law for each cut** holds:
\[
\forall S\subseteq V(G):\quad \sum_{e\in \delta^+(S)}\varphi(e)=\sum_{e\in \delta^-(S)}\varphi(e).
\]

In either case, \(\varphi\) is a **nowhere‑zero** weak/strong \(A\)‑flow if \(\varphi^{-1}(0)=\varnothing\).

**Definition 3 (bridge).**  
An edge \(e\) of \(G\) is a **bridge** if deleting \(e\) increases the number of connected components. A bridge is **2‑way infinite** if both resulting components are infinite, and **1‑way infinite** otherwise.

Every strong flow is a weak flow. While the two notions are equivalent on finite graphs, they diverge on infinite graphs: e.g., on a two‑way infinite path, a nowhere‑zero weak \(A\)‑flow exists but a strong one does not. In [6] the authors construct a 3‑connected graph with two ends that admits a nowhere‑zero weak \(A\)‑flow but no nowhere‑zero strong \(A\)‑flow. Nearly all finite flow theorems extend to infinite **strong** \(A\)‑flows via topological compactness; here we use **logical** compactness to obtain:

**Theorem 4.**  
*A countably infinite, locally finite graph without a 1‑way infinite bridge has a nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow.*

### 2. Metric space of rooted connected graphs

Since no good probability measure exists for countable graphs, we study typicality via a metric topology and Baire category.

**Definition 5 (ε‑neighborhood).**  
For a metric space \((X,d)\) and \(x\in X\), the ε‑neighborhood is \(U_\varepsilon(x)=\{y\in X:\ d(x,y)<\varepsilon\}\). The closed neighborhood \(\overline{U}_\varepsilon(x)\) uses \(d(x,y)\le \varepsilon\).

**Definition 6 (open set).**  
A set \(U\subseteq X\) is open if \(\forall x\in U\ \exists \varepsilon>0:\ U_\varepsilon(x)\subseteq U\).

We now fix the graph space and metric.

**Definition 9 (space of rooted graphs).**  
Let \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) be the set of all connected rooted graphs (up to root‑preserving isomorphism). For \(D>2\), let \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) be those with all degrees \(\le D\), and \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) those with all degrees \(=D\).

**Definition 10 (r‑ball).**  
For \((G,v)\), the rooted r‑ball is
\[
B_r(G,v)=(\,G[\{y\in V(G): d(v,y)\le r\}],\,v\,).
\]

**Definition 11 (metric \(d_\bullet\)).**  
For \((G_1,v_1),(G_2,v_2)\in\mathbf{G}_\bullet\),
\[
d_\bullet\big((G_1,v_1),(G_2,v_2)\big)=\inf\{2^{-r} : B_r(G_1,v_1)\cong B_r(G_2,v_2)\}.
\]
This is a metric [5].

**Definition 12 (extensions of an r‑ball).**  
For an r‑ball \(F=B_r(G,v)\), define
\[
\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F=\{(G',v')\in \mathbf{G}_\bullet : B_r(G',v')\cong F\}.
\]

**Lemma 13 (basic facts in \((\mathbf{G}_\bullet,d_\bullet)\)).**  
- For each \((G,x)\), \(r\in\mathbb{N}\), and \(0<\varepsilon<1\):
  \[
  U_{2^{-r}+\varepsilon}((G,x))=U_{2^{-r}}((G,x))=\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{B_r(G,x)}.
  \]
- \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F\) is nonempty if \(F\) is an r‑ball in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) that contains a vertex of degree \< \(D\) at distance \(r\) from the root.
- A subset \(S\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) is nowhere dense iff
  \(\forall\) r‑balls \(F\ \exists\) r′‑ball \(F'\) with \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F'}\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F}\setminus S\).
- For all \(D>2\), \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) is not meagre.

### Main results on typical properties

**Theorem 14.**  
*The set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense (i) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) for all \(D>2\); and (ii) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) for all odd \(D>2\).*  
In D‑regular graphs with even \(D\), 1‑way infinite bridges cannot exist; instead we obtain:

**Theorem 15.**  
*The set of graphs without a cut vertex is nowhere dense in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

**Theorem 16.**  
*The set of graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge is meagre (but not nowhere dense) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

We also considered other (a)typical properties:

**Theorem 17.**  
*The set of graphs with edge‑chromatic number \(D\) is nowhere dense in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

### 3. Proof sketches

**Proof of Theorem 4 (sketch).**  
Let the vertices of \(G\) be \(v_1,v_2,\ldots\) and orient each edge \(\{v_i,v_j\}\) from the smaller to the larger index. For each radius \(r\), augment the r‑ball \(B_r(G,v_1)\) to a finite multigraph \(G_r\) by adding a sink vertex \(v_\infty\) and connecting boundary edges to \(v_\infty\). Introduce Boolean variables \(F_{e,1},\dots,F_{e,6}\) encoding which of six nonzero values an edge \(e\) receives, enforce exclusivity \(\bigvee_i F_{e,i}\) and \(\bigwedge_{j\ne i}\neg F_{e,j}\), and write linear parity constraints at each vertex (Kirchhoff’s law). Let \(F_{G_r}\) be the conjunction over vertices of \(G_r\); then every finite subset of the constraint family \(\{F_{G_r}\}_r\cup\{F_{e,i}\}_e\) is satisfiable (by [7]), hence by compactness [4] the whole set is satisfiable, yielding a nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow on \(G\).

**Proof idea for Theorem 14.**  
Given an r‑ball \(F\), construct an r′‑ball \(F'\) such that every extension of \(F'\) contains a bridge. For \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\), attach a leaf to a boundary vertex of degree \<\(D\). For \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) handle regularity via parity gadgets: define \(S(F)=\sum_{v\in L_r}(D-\deg v)\) where \(L_r\) is the boundary; use \(K_{D+1}-e\) gadgets and tree‑like expansions to force parity \(S(F)=1\), then attach a new vertex to create a bridge. Hence the bridgeless set is nowhere dense.

**Proof idea for Theorem 15.**  
In even \(D\)‑regular graphs, use gadgets to force a cut vertex; in odd \(D\) or degree‑bounded spaces, this also follows from the previous construction.

**Proof idea for Theorem 16.**  
Being “there is a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance \(k\)” is nowhere dense; take a union over \(k\in\mathbb{N}\) to get a meagre (but not nowhere‑dense) set.

**Proof idea for Theorem 17.**  
For each \(D\), there exist \(D\)‑regular graphs with \(\chi'(G)=D+1\) (even \(D\): complete graphs or any odd‑order \(D\)‑regular graph; odd \(D\): by Tutte’s theorem). Removing an edge preserves \(\chi'=D+1\) by parity. Embed parity gadgets within r‑balls so that every extension has edge‑chromatic number \(D+1\), hence the set is nowhere dense.

---

### 4. Future work (the conjectures)

**Question 18.** *Is the fact that a property is nowhere dense or meagre independent of the root?*  
A change of root gives one type of change of metric; however, many metrics on the space of countable graphs are possible.

**Question 19.** *Is there another metric on \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) where typical properties are different?*  
For instance, is there a metric in which **bridgeless graphs are typical**?

We also aim to investigate additional (a)typical properties in the spirit of Theorem 17.
