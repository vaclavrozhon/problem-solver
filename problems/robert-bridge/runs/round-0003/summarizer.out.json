  "summary_md": "Last round: proved that nowhere density of S_P is independent of the root. Key lemma: for any saturated S, cl(S) and Int(cl(S)) are saturated (proved by transporting large matching balls and re\u2011rooting). Equivalently, gave a root\u2011free cylinder criterion: S_P is nowhere dense iff every rooted r\u2011ball F has an extension F' whose cylinder is disjoint from S_P. Hence nowhere\u2011dense status of any unrooted property P is root\u2011invariant. The meagre part remains open; proposed route: build a comeagre locally rigid Good_\u221e via degree\u2011preserving marker gadgets, reduce saturations Sat(N) to countably many homeomorphic images plus ambiguity sets Amb_k, and prove Amb_k are meagre (or else produce a Borel selector on a comeagre domain). Note: the forget\u2011the\u2011root quotient need not be open, so naive quotient arguments fail. Citations: Current Proofs; papers/paper1.txt.",
