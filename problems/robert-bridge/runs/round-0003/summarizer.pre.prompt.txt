## Setting

- Fix an integer \(D \ge 2\).
- Let \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) be the space of **countably infinite, connected, rooted graphs** \((G,\rho)\).
- For \((G,\rho) \in \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) and \(r \in \mathbb{N}\), let \(B_r(G,\rho)\) denote the rooted (closed) ball of radius \(r\) about \(\rho\).
- Equip \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) with the **local (Benjamini–Schramm) metric** \(d_\bullet\) given by
  \[
  d_\bullet\big((G,\rho),(H,\sigma)\big)=2^{-R},
  \qquad
  R=\sup\{r\in\mathbb{N} : B_r(G,\rho)\cong B_r(H,\sigma)\}.
  \]
  (Equivalently, \(d_\bullet((G,\rho),(H,\sigma))<2^{-r}\) iff \(B_r(G,\rho)\cong B_r(H,\sigma)\).)
- Degree‑constrained subspaces:
  - \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\): all rooted graphs with \(\Delta(G)\le D\).
  - \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,= D}\): all rooted graphs with \(\Delta(G)= D\).
  We write \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for either of these when the distinction is unimportant.
- A subset \(S\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) is **nowhere dense** if the interior of \(\overline{S}\) is empty. A set is **meagre** (first category) if it is a countable union of nowhere dense sets; its complement is **comeagre**. A property is called **typical** if the corresponding set is comeagre.
- An edge \(e\) of an (unrooted) graph \(G\) is a **bridge** if \(G-e\) has more connected components than \(G\). A bridge is **2‑way infinite** if both components are infinite and **1‑way infinite** otherwise.

# Research Notes



Conjecture (Root‑invariance of smallness). For an unrooted property P and S_P={ (G,\rho) in G_{\bullet,D} : G has P }, does the nowhere‑dense/meagre status of S_P depend on root choices?

Agreed notions
- Saturated sets: S is saturated if (G,\rho) in S implies (G,u) in S for every vertex u of G. For unrooted P, S_P is saturated.
- Cylinders form a clopen base in the local topology, hence nowhere density can be witnessed by refining cylinders.

Key lemma (settled). If S is saturated, then cl(S) and Int(cl(S)) are saturated. Sketch: For (G,\rho) in cl(S) and u in V(G), for each t pick r≫dist(\rho,u)+t and (H_r,\sigma_r) in S with B_r matching at the root; transport the root to the image of u and use saturation to see (H_r,u_r) in S with B_t(H_r,u_r)≅B_t(G,u). Thus (G,u) in cl(S). Interior of a saturated set is saturated because open sets are unions of cylinders and re‑rooting preserves membership.

Consequence (nowhere density is root‑invariant). S is nowhere dense iff Int(cl(S))=\emptyset. For saturated S this condition is root‑free; applied to S_P it proves the ND half of the conjecture.

Caveat on quotients. Let π: G_{\bullet,D}→U_q be the quotient by forgetting the root. In general, π maps open cylinders to sets whose preimages are the saturations of those cylinders, which need not be open; π(C) need not be open. Thus arguments that rely on π being open are invalid. Any quotient‑based comparison must work with saturated open sets only, or with a selector on a comeagre domain.

Meagre part: current route and plan. Define Good_∞ (comeagre local rigidity): around the root and finitely many steps, distinct neighbors are eventually distinguishable. Using (degree‑preserving) markers, each Bad_{m,\ell} should be nowhere dense; this yields a comeagre domain on which countably many partial re‑rooting homeomorphisms generate all finite re‑rootings. Then: the saturation of a nowhere‑dense set is meagre (countable union of homeomorphic images of a nowhere‑dense set plus a meagre exceptional set). This would imply meagreness for many S_P constructed as saturations of root‑local nowhere‑dense witnesses. Completing this requires explicit marker gadgets in both Δ≤D and Δ= D (odd/even cases).

Open items
- Finish the Good_∞ construction with uniform markers in Δ= D and write the proof that each Bad_{m,\ell} is nowhere dense.
- Either produce a Borel/continuous selector on a comeagre domain (unique marked root) to compare meagreness between U_q and the rooted space, or construct a counterexample showing full meagre equivalence can fail without extra structure.
- Optional: record the metric off‑by‑one correction and the safe non‑emptiness criterion for cylinders (≤D is straightforward).

Clarification: Nowhere-density root-invariance does not require that Int(cl(S)) be saturated. For an unrooted property P, S_P is saturated and the cylinder criterion yields a root-free formulation: S_P is nowhere dense iff for every rooted r-ball F there is an extension F′ such that every D-bounded connected graph containing a copy of F′ (at some vertex) fails P. This avoids any subtlety about interiors of closures.

Caveat on quotients: The forget-the-root quotient map π need not send cylinders to open sets in the quotient of the rooted topology; saturations of cylinders are typically not open. Thus arguments that rely on π being open (or category-preserving) are invalid. Work directly with the rooted clopen cylinder basis.

Meagre part plan update: Replace the previous “Bad_{m,ℓ} is nowhere dense” approach (false in general) by the Amb_k reduction: for nowhere-dense N, Sat_k(N) is covered by countably many homeomorphic images of N plus the ambiguity set Amb_k (points where some step of re-rooting is not uniquely determined). If we can show each Amb_k is meagre via intrinsic markers (degree-preserving gadgets in ≤D and =D), then Sat(N) is meagre. Action items: design explicit port/marker gadgets and prove the Amb_k meagreness. Also, fix parity/scope issues for regular even D (no bridges) in related theorems.

# Main Results

Theorem (Root-invariance of nowhere density). Fix D≥2. Let P be any property of unrooted graphs and let S_P={ (G,\rho) in G_{\bullet,D} : G has P }. Then S_P is nowhere dense in (G_{\bullet,D},d_\bullet) if and only if the following equivalent, root-free condition holds:
For every rooted r-ball F there exists an extension r′-ball F′ with G_{\bullet}^{F′}⊆G_{\bullet}^{F} such that for every D-bounded connected graph H and vertex v with B_{r′}(H,v)≅F′, the unrooted graph H does not have P.
In particular, whether S_P is nowhere dense does not depend on how graphs are rooted.

Proof. Cylinders G_{\bullet}^{F} form a clopen base of the local topology. If S_P is nowhere dense, then for each r-ball F there exists a subcylinder G_{\bullet}^{F′}⊆G_{\bullet}^{F} with G_{\bullet}^{F′}∩S_P=\emptyset. Hence any (H,v) whose r′-ball equals F′ lies outside S_P, so H fails P. Conversely, if such F′ exists for each F, then every nonempty cylinder contains a subcylinder disjoint from S_P, which is equivalent to S_P being nowhere dense. This criterion refers only to P and D, not to a chosen root, establishing root-invariance. ∎

Note. The meagre part of the conjecture remains open in full generality. A promising route proceeds via covering the re-root saturations of nowhere-dense sets by countably many homeomorphic images plus a small ambiguity set; proving that the ambiguity set is meagre (via degree-preserving marker gadgets) would settle meagre root-invariance for broad classes of properties.


=== Verifier Summary ===

We can now rigorously conclude: for any unrooted property P, S_P is nowhere dense in the rooted local space iff a root-free cylinder criterion holds—hence ND status is root-invariant. The prior reliance on “Int(cl(S)) is saturated” is unnecessary and risky. The meagre half remains open; a promising route via re-rooting templates reduces it to proving ambiguity sets Amb_k are meagre, which requires explicit degree-preserving markers. Quotient-based meagre equivalence as stated is flawed (π(C) not open). Output updated to give a cylinder-based proof of ND root-invariance.

# Rigorous Proofs



Definitions. A subset S of G_{\bullet,D} is saturated if for every (G,\rho) in S and every vertex u of G, (G,u) is also in S.

Lemma 1 (closure and interior of saturated sets are saturated). Let S be saturated. Then cl(S) and Int(cl(S)) are saturated.
Proof. We first show cl(S) is saturated. Fix (G,\rho) in cl(S) and u in V(G). For each integer t≥0, choose r≥t+dist_G(\rho,u). By (G,\rho) in cl(S), there exists (H_r,\sigma_r) in S and a root‑preserving isomorphism \phi_r: B_r(G,\rho)→B_r(H_r,\sigma_r). Let u_r=\phi_r(u). Since S is saturated and (H_r,\sigma_r) in S, also (H_r,u_r) in S. Moreover, B_t(G,u)≅B_t(H_r,u_r) because t≤r−dist(\rho,u). Hence for every t there is an element of S whose t‑ball at the root matches B_t(G,u); thus (G,u) in cl(S). Therefore cl(S) is saturated.
For the interior, note that Int(cl(S)) is a union of open sets contained in cl(S), and re‑rooting preserves membership in cl(S) by the first part. Hence Int(cl(S)) is saturated. ∎

Theorem 2 (root‑invariance of nowhere density). Let P be any property of unrooted graphs and S_P={ (G,\rho) in G_{\bullet,D} : G has P }. Then S_P is nowhere dense in (G_{\bullet,D},d_\bullet) if and only if Int(cl(S_P))=\emptyset, and this condition is independent of the choice of root. In particular, whether S_P is nowhere dense does not depend on the root.
Proof. S_P is saturated. By Lemma 1, cl(S_P) and Int(cl(S_P)) are saturated. Since “nowhere dense” means Int(cl(S_P))=\emptyset, the statement is root‑invariant. ∎

Definitions. A subset S of G_{\bullet,D} is saturated if (G,\rho) in S implies (G,u) in S for all vertices u of G. For an r-ball F, the cylinder C(F):=G_{\bullet}^{F}={ (H,\sigma): B_r(H,\sigma)≅F }.

Lemma 1 (cylinders are clopen). For every finite rooted ball F, the cylinder C(F) is open and closed in (G_{\bullet,D},d_\bullet).
Proof. Openness: If (H,\sigma)\in C(F) with F an r-ball, then for any ε with 0<ε≤2^{-(r+1)} the ε-ball around (H,\sigma) equals C(F). Closedness: If (H,\sigma)\notin C(F), then B_r(H,\sigma) is some r-ball F'\not\cong F; hence (H,\sigma) lies in the open cylinder C(F'), and the complement of C(F) is the union of such cylinders. ∎

Lemma 2 (closure of saturated sets is saturated). If S⊆G_{\bullet,D} is saturated, then cl(S) is saturated.
Proof. Fix (G,\rho)\in cl(S) and u\in V(G). For t≥0, choose r≥t+dist_G(\rho,u). There exists (H_r,\sigma_r)\in S with B_r(H_r,\sigma_r)≅B_r(G,\rho). Transport u to u_r via this isomorphism. By saturation, (H_r,u_r)\in S, and B_t(H_r,u_r)≅B_t(G,u). Thus every neighborhood of (G,u) meets S, so (G,u)\in cl(S). ∎

Proposition 3 (root-free cylinder criterion for nowhere density). Let P be a property of unrooted graphs and S_P={ (G,\rho): G has P }. The following are equivalent:
(a) S_P is nowhere dense in G_{\bullet,D}.
(b) For every rooted r-ball F there exists an extension r′-ball F′ with C(F′)⊆C(F) and such that for every D-bounded connected graph H and vertex v with B_{r′}(H,v)≅F′, the unrooted graph H does not have P.
Proof. (a⇒b) Since cylinders form a clopen base (Lemma 1), nowhere denseness yields for each F a subcylinder C(F′)⊆C(F) disjoint from S_P. Any (H,v) with B_{r′}(H,v)≅F′ then lies outside S_P, hence H fails P. (b⇒a) If (b) holds, then each cylinder C(F) contains a subcylinder C(F′) disjoint from S_P, which is equivalent to S_P being nowhere dense. ∎

Theorem 4 (Root-invariance of nowhere density). Fix D≥2. For any unrooted property P, the set S_P={ (G,\rho) in G_{\bullet,D} : G has P } is nowhere dense in (G_{\bullet,D},d_\bullet) if and only if the root-free condition (b) in Proposition 3 holds. In particular, the nowhere-dense status of S_P is independent of root choices.
Proof. Immediate from Proposition 3. ∎

### Typical properties of countable graphs: flows and bridges  
*(Extended abstract)*  

**Robert Šámal**\* · **Hadi Zamani**\*

#### Abstract
We have two aims. **First**, we study nowhere‑zero flows in countably infinite graphs, observing the different roles of two types of bridges. **Second**, we study how typical graphs with these types of bridges are. As there is no natural probability measure to use, we turn to an analytic approach: we study which sets are nowhere dense and which are meagre.

In finite graphs, bridges play a crucial role—it is easy to see that every flow assigns value \(0\) to every bridge. It is also known that graphs with a bridge are not typical: both dense random graphs and random regular graphs are bridgeless w.h.p. [3, 1]. We ask how this transfers to countable graphs. In Section 1 we explain differences between bridges and flows and, via compactness, we prove a version of Seymour’s 6‑flow theorem for countable graphs.

In Section 2 we explore nowhere‑dense and meagre sets. This is called for because the usual probabilistic models collapse: extending Erdős–Rényi to countably infinite graphs yields the Rado graph a.s., so we are effectively studying a single graph up to isomorphism. Attempting random regular graphs via the configuration model [1] would require a uniform distribution on perfect matchings of a countable set (e.g., neighbors of the first vertex), which does not exist. Consequently, we turn to Baire category: meagre/co‑meagre sets (also “first/second category”).

### 1. Nowhere‑zero flows for infinite graphs

**Definition 1 (weak flow).**  
Given an orientation \(D\) of a graph \(G\) and an abelian group \(A\), a **weak \(A\)‑flow** is a function \(\varphi:E(G)\to A\) such that **Kirchhoff’s law for each vertex cut** holds:
\[
\forall v\in V(G):\quad \sum_{e\in \delta^-(v)}\varphi(e)=\sum_{e\in \delta^+(v)}\varphi(e).
\]

**Definition 2 (strong flow).**  
Given \(D,G,A\) as above, a **strong \(A\)‑flow** is a function \(\varphi:E(G)\to A\) such that **Kirchhoff’s law for each cut** holds:
\[
\forall S\subseteq V(G):\quad \sum_{e\in \delta^+(S)}\varphi(e)=\sum_{e\in \delta^-(S)}\varphi(e).
\]

In either case, \(\varphi\) is a **nowhere‑zero** weak/strong \(A\)‑flow if \(\varphi^{-1}(0)=\varnothing\).

**Definition 3 (bridge).**  
An edge \(e\) of \(G\) is a **bridge** if deleting \(e\) increases the number of connected components. A bridge is **2‑way infinite** if both resulting components are infinite, and **1‑way infinite** otherwise.

Every strong flow is a weak flow. While the two notions are equivalent on finite graphs, they diverge on infinite graphs: e.g., on a two‑way infinite path, a nowhere‑zero weak \(A\)‑flow exists but a strong one does not. In [6] the authors construct a 3‑connected graph with two ends that admits a nowhere‑zero weak \(A\)‑flow but no nowhere‑zero strong \(A\)‑flow. Nearly all finite flow theorems extend to infinite **strong** \(A\)‑flows via topological compactness; here we use **logical** compactness to obtain:

**Theorem 4.**  
*A countably infinite, locally finite graph without a 1‑way infinite bridge has a nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow.*

---

### 2. Metric space of rooted connected graphs

Since no good probability measure exists for countable graphs, we study typicality via a metric topology and Baire category.

**Definition 5 (ε‑neighborhood).**  
For a metric space \((X,d)\) and \(x\in X\), the ε‑neighborhood is \(U_\varepsilon(x)=\{y\in X:\ d(x,y)<\varepsilon\}\). The closed neighborhood \(\overline{U}_\varepsilon(x)\) uses \(d(x,y)\le \varepsilon\).

**Definition 6 (open set).**  
A set \(U\subseteq X\) is open if \(\forall x\in U\ \exists \varepsilon>0:\ U_\varepsilon(x)\subseteq U\).

We now fix the graph space and metric.

**Definition 9 (space of rooted graphs).**  
Let \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) be the set of all connected rooted graphs (up to root‑preserving isomorphism). For \(D>2\), let \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) be those with all degrees \(\le D\), and \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) those with all degrees \(=D\).

**Definition 10 (r‑ball).**  
For \((G,v)\), the rooted r‑ball is
\[
B_r(G,v)=(\,G[\{y\in V(G): d(v,y)\le r\}],\,v\,).
\]

**Definition 11 (metric \(d_\bullet\)).**  
For \((G_1,v_1),(G_2,v_2)\in\mathbf{G}_\bullet\),
\[
d_\bullet\big((G_1,v_1),(G_2,v_2)\big)=\inf\{2^{-r} : B_r(G_1,v_1)\cong B_r(G_2,v_2)\}.
\]
This is a metric [5].

**Definition 12 (extensions of an r‑ball).**  
For an r‑ball \(F=B_r(G,v)\), define
\[
\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F=\{(G',v')\in \mathbf{G}_\bullet : B_r(G',v')\cong F\}.
\]

**Lemma 13 (basic facts in \((\mathbf{G}_\bullet,d_\bullet)\)).**  
- For each \((G,x)\), \(r\in\mathbb{N}\), and \(0<\varepsilon<1\):
  \[
  U_{2^{-r}+\varepsilon}((G,x))=U_{2^{-r}}((G,x))=\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{B_r(G,x)}.
  \]
- \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F\) is nonempty if \(F\) is an r‑ball in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) that contains a vertex of degree \< \(D\) at distance \(r\) from the root.
- A subset \(S\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) is nowhere dense iff
  \(\forall\) r‑balls \(F\ \exists\) r′‑ball \(F'\) with \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F'}\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F}\setminus S\).
- For all \(D>2\), \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) is not meagre.

---

### Main results on typical properties

**Theorem 14.**  
*The set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense (i) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) for all \(D>2\); and (ii) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) for all odd \(D>2\).*  
In D‑regular graphs with even \(D\), 1‑way infinite bridges cannot exist; instead we obtain:

**Theorem 15.**  
*The set of graphs without a cut vertex is nowhere dense in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

**Theorem 16.**  
*The set of graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge is meagre (but not nowhere dense) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

We also considered other (a)typical properties:

**Theorem 17.**  
*The set of graphs with edge‑chromatic number \(D\) is nowhere dense in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

### 3. Proof sketches

**Proof of Theorem 4 (sketch).**  
Let the vertices of \(G\) be \(v_1,v_2,\ldots\) and orient each edge \(\{v_i,v_j\}\) from the smaller to the larger index. For each radius \(r\), augment the r‑ball \(B_r(G,v_1)\) to a finite multigraph \(G_r\) by adding a sink vertex \(v_\infty\) and connecting boundary edges to \(v_\infty\). Introduce Boolean variables \(F_{e,1},\dots,F_{e,6}\) encoding which of six nonzero values an edge \(e\) receives, enforce exclusivity \(\bigvee_i F_{e,i}\) and \(\bigwedge_{j\ne i}\neg F_{e,j}\), and write linear parity constraints at each vertex (Kirchhoff’s law). Let \(F_{G_r}\) be the conjunction over vertices of \(G_r\); then every finite subset of the constraint family \(\{F_{G_r}\}_r\cup\{F_{e,i}\}_e\) is satisfiable (by [7]), hence by compactness [4] the whole set is satisfiable, yielding a nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow on \(G\).

**Proof idea for Theorem 14.**  
Given an r‑ball \(F\), construct an r′‑ball \(F'\) such that every extension of \(F'\) contains a bridge. For \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\), attach a leaf to a boundary vertex of degree \<\(D\). For \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) handle regularity via parity gadgets: define \(S(F)=\sum_{v\in L_r}(D-\deg v)\) where \(L_r\) is the boundary; use \(K_{D+1}-e\) gadgets and tree‑like expansions to force parity \(S(F)=1\), then attach a new vertex to create a bridge. Hence the bridgeless set is nowhere dense.

**Proof idea for Theorem 15.**  
In even \(D\)‑regular graphs, use gadgets to force a cut vertex; in odd \(D\) or degree‑bounded spaces, this also follows from the previous construction.

**Proof idea for Theorem 16.**  
Being “there is a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance \(k\)” is nowhere dense; take a union over \(k\in\mathbb{N}\) to get a meagre (but not nowhere‑dense) set.

**Proof idea for Theorem 17.**  
For each \(D\), there exist \(D\)‑regular graphs with \(\chi'(G)=D+1\) (even \(D\): complete graphs or any odd‑order \(D\)‑regular graph; odd \(D\): by Tutte’s theorem). Removing an edge preserves \(\chi'=D+1\) by parity. Embed parity gadgets within r‑balls so that every extension has edge‑chromatic number \(D+1\), hence the set is nowhere dense.

### 4. Future work (the conjectures)

**Question 18.** *Is the fact that a property is nowhere dense or meagre independent of the root?*  
A change of root gives one type of change of metric; however, many metrics on the space of countable graphs are possible.

**Question 19.** *Is there another metric on \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) where typical properties are different?*  
For instance, is there a metric in which **bridgeless graphs are typical**?

We also aim to investigate additional (a)typical properties in the spirit of Theorem 17.
