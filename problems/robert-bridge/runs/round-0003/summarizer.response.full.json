The summary_md needs to be a concise paragraph under 200 words, ideally around 100 words, describing the main results and open items. I\u2019ll also generate five bullet points for highlights and three follow-up questions. The challenge is that the citations requested by the developer aren\u2019t specified in the schema, but they were mentioned elsewhere. I'll clarify how to incorporate them.",

The earlier schema didn\u2019t specify a citations field, which raises confusion since I previously had citations included in summary_md.
