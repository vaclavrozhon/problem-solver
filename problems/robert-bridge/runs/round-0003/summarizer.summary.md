Last round: proved that nowhere density of S_P is independent of the root. Key lemma: for any saturated S, cl(S) and Int(cl(S)) are saturated (proved by transporting large matching balls and re‑rooting). Equivalently, gave a root‑free cylinder criterion: S_P is nowhere dense iff every rooted r‑ball F has an extension F' whose cylinder is disjoint from S_P. Hence nowhere‑dense status of any unrooted property P is root‑invariant. The meagre part remains open; proposed route: build a comeagre locally rigid Good_∞ via degree‑preserving marker gadgets, reduce saturations Sat(N) to countably many homeomorphic images plus ambiguity sets Amb_k, and prove Amb_k are meagre (or else produce a Borel selector on a comeagre domain). Note: the forget‑the‑root quotient need not be open, so naive quotient arguments fail. Citations: Current Proofs; papers/paper1.txt.
