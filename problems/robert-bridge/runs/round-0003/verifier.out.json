  "feedback_md": "Key points. (i) The nowhere-dense half of the conjecture is now on firm ground without any quotient machinery: for saturated S (such as S_P for an unrooted property P), closure is saturated, and the cylinder characterization gives a root-free criterion for nowhere denseness. (ii) The meagre half is not settled; previous plans relying on \u201clocal rigidity\u201d via Bad_{m,\u2113} were overoptimistic\u2014such Bad sets can have nonempty interior. A refined reduction via re-rooting templates and ambiguity sets Amb_k looks promising but requires nontrivial marker constructions.\n\nProver 1. Your quotient-space framing is conceptually nice, but the core step \u201c\u03c0(C) is open\u201d (used in both Theorem A and Theorem B) is incorrect for the quotient by forgetting the root in the rooted local topology: saturations of cylinders need not be open. This invalidates the meagre-equivalence proof and endangers the ND-equivalence proof as written. Please avoid relying on \u03c0\u2019s openness; use the clopen-cylinder basis and saturation directly in the rooted space (see P2\u2019s and P3\u2019s arguments).\n\nProver 2. Strong contribution: a clean cylinder-based, root-free characterization of nowhere density for saturated sets; and a precise reduction for the meagre case: Sat_k(N) \u2286 Amb_k \u222a \u22c3 homeomorphic images of N. The recognition that Bad_{m,\u2113} may have interior is important. The missing piece is to prove Amb_k is meagre (for all k) via intrinsic, degree-preserving \u201cmarker\u201d gadgets in both \u0394\u2264D and \u0394=D (even/odd). Formalize these gadgets and the template coverage rigorously.\n\nProver 3. Useful corrections to metric off-by-one and clopen cylinders, and a succinct, correct proof that closures of saturated sets are saturated. However, do not assert \u201cInt(cl(S)) is saturated\u201d without proof\u2014this is subtle and not needed. Your concrete fixes for Theorems 14\u201317 are on the right track; please supply full gadgets and degree bookkeeping, especially for (=D, even) cases.\n\nNext steps. (1) Keep the ND result but replace the proof in the main output by the cylinder-based argument that avoids Int(cl(S)). (2) Develop explicit port/marker gadgets to show Amb_k is meagre; then finish the re-rooting-template argument to get meagre root-invariance for saturated sets. (3) Repair statements about regular even D (no bridges) and provide full proofs for Theorems 14\u201317 with parity checks and completion lemmas. (4) Either complete or retract the quotient-space meagre equivalence.\n",
  "summary_md": "We can now rigorously conclude: for any unrooted property P, S_P is nowhere dense in the rooted local space iff a root-free cylinder criterion holds\u2014hence ND status is root-invariant.

This avoids any subtlety about interiors of closures.\n\nCaveat on quotients: The forget-the-root quotient map \u03c0 need not send cylinders to open sets in the quotient of the rooted topology; saturations of cylinders are typically not open. Thus arguments that rely on \u03c0 being open (or category-preserving) are invalid. Work directly with the rooted clopen cylinder basis.\n\nMeagre part plan update: Replace the previous \u201cBad_{m,\u2113} is nowhere dense\u201d approach (false in general) by the Amb_k reduction: for nowhere-dense N, Sat_k(N) is covered by countably many homeomorphic images of N plus the ambiguity set Amb_k (points where some step of re-rooting is not uniquely determined). If we can show each Amb_k is meagre via intrinsic markers (degree-preserving gadgets in \u2264D and =D), then Sat(N) is meagre.

For every finite rooted ball F, the cylinder C(F) is open and closed in (G_{\\bullet,D},d_\\bullet).\nProof. Openness: If (H,\\sigma)\\in C(F) with F an r-ball, then for any \u03b5 with 0<\u03b5\u22642^{-(r+1)} the \u03b5-ball around (H,\\sigma) equals C(F). Closedness: If (H,\\sigma)\\notin C(F), then B_r(H,\\sigma) is some r-ball F'\\not\\cong F; hence (H,\\sigma) lies in the open cylinder C(F'), and the complement of C(F) is the union of such cylinders. \u220e\n\nLemma 2 (closure of saturated sets is saturated). If S\u2286G_{\\bullet,D} is saturated, then cl(S) is saturated.\nProof. Fix (G,\\rho)\\in cl(S) and u\\in V(G). For t\u22650, choose r\u2265t+dist_G(\\rho,u). There exists (H_r,\\sigma_r)\\in S with B_r(H_r,\\sigma_r)\u2245B_r(G,\\rho). Transport u to u_r via this isomorphism. By saturation, (H_r,u_r)\\in S, and B_t(H_r,u_r)\u2245B_t(G,u). Thus every neighborhood of (G,u) meets S, so (G,u)\\in cl(S). \u220e\n\nProposition 3 (root-free cylinder criterion for nowhere density). Let P be a property of unrooted graphs and S_P={ (G,\\rho): G has P }. The following are equivalent:\n(a) S_P is nowhere dense in G_{\\bullet,D}.\n(b) For every rooted r-ball F there exists an extension r\u2032-ball F\u2032 with C(F\u2032)\u2286C(F) and such that for every D-bounded connected graph H and vertex v with B_{r\u2032}(H,v)\u2245F\u2032, the unrooted graph H does not have P.\nProof. (a\u21d2b) Since cylinders form a clopen base (Lemma 1), nowhere denseness yields for each F a subcylinder C(F\u2032)\u2286C(F) disjoint from S_P. Any (H,v) with B_{r\u2032}(H,v)\u2245F\u2032 then lies outside S_P, hence H fails P. (b\u21d2a) If (b) holds, then each cylinder C(F) contains a subcylinder C(F\u2032) disjoint from S_P, which is equivalent to S_P being nowhere dense. \u220e\n\nTheorem 4 (Root-invariance of nowhere density).

Then S_P is nowhere dense in (G_{\\bullet,D},d_\\bullet) if and only if the following equivalent, root-free condition holds:\nFor every rooted r-ball F there exists an extension r\u2032-ball F\u2032 with G_{\\bullet}^{F\u2032}\u2286G_{\\bullet}^{F} such that for every D-bounded connected graph H and vertex v with B_{r\u2032}(H,v)\u2245F\u2032, the unrooted graph H does not have P.\nIn particular, whether S_P is nowhere dense does not depend on how graphs are rooted.\n\nProof. Cylinders G_{\\bullet}^{F} form a clopen base of the local topology. If S_P is nowhere dense, then for each r-ball F there exists a subcylinder G_{\\bullet}^{F\u2032}\u2286G_{\\bullet}^{F} with G_{\\bullet}^{F\u2032}\u2229S_P=\\emptyset.

This criterion refers only to P and D, not to a chosen root, establishing root-invariance. \u220e\n\nNote. The meagre part of the conjecture remains open in full generality. A promising route proceeds via covering the re-root saturations of nowhere-dense sets by countably many homeomorphic images plus a small ambiguity set; proving that the ambiguity set is meagre (via degree-preserving marker gadgets) would settle meagre root-invariance for broad classes of properties."
