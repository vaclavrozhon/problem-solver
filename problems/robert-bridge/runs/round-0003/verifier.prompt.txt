=== SYSTEM ===
You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md, proofs.md, and output.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers
- notes.md (informal progress & exploratory work so far)
- proofs.md (rigorous proofs & detailed mathematics so far)
- output.md (main results found so far)

**Three-tier file system guidelines**:
- **notes.md**: Readable, log of exploratory work, intuitions, failed attempts, ideas. Prefer appending. Replace only if old notes are clearly misleading. It should be self-contained: In particular, reading it should make sense without knowing the output of provers in past rounds. 

- **proofs.md**: Complete rigorous mathematical proofs with full details. Think twice before adding anything. Contains proven lemmas, theorems, and detailed derivations. Only add mathematically verified content here.
- **output.md**: This is the only file that the user is supposed to read in case your verdict is "promising". It has to be self-contained. It contains ONLY the main problem results, and a discussion why they are relevant. It is extremely selective. Think twice before promoting proofs from proofs.md to output.md. Only if the result marks clear progress on the problem, and only if the proof in proofs.md has been thoroughly vetted by provers and you, it can join output.md. Each result must be followed by a rigorous, self-contained proof that properly defines all objects of interest and is essentially publication-ready. 

Tasks:
1) Audit rigor: identify unjustified steps, false statements, missing lemmas; produce minimal counterexamples.
2) Triage value: separate genuine progress from noise.
3) Guide next steps: propose what provers should try next.

## Setting

- Fix an integer \(D \ge 2\).
- Let \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) be the space of **countably infinite, connected, rooted graphs** \((G,\rho)\).
- For \((G,\rho) \in \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) and \(r \in \mathbb{N}\), let \(B_r(G,\rho)\) denote the rooted (closed) ball of radius \(r\) about \(\rho\).
- Equip \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) with the **local (Benjamini–Schramm) metric** \(d_\bullet\) given by
  \[
  d_\bullet\big((G,\rho),(H,\sigma)\big)=2^{-R},
  \qquad
  R=\sup\{r\in\mathbb{N} : B_r(G,\rho)\cong B_r(H,\sigma)\}.
  \]
  (Equivalently, \(d_\bullet((G,\rho),(H,\sigma))<2^{-r}\) iff \(B_r(G,\rho)\cong B_r(H,\sigma)\).)
- Degree‑constrained subspaces:
  - \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\): all rooted graphs with \(\Delta(G)\le D\).
  - \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,= D}\): all rooted graphs with \(\Delta(G)= D\).
  We write \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for either of these when the distinction is unimportant.
- A subset \(S\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) is **nowhere dense** if the interior of \(\overline{S}\) is empty. A set is **meagre** (first category) if it is a countable union of nowhere dense sets; its complement is **comeagre**. A property is called **typical** if the corresponding set is comeagre.
- An edge \(e\) of an (unrooted) graph \(G\) is a **bridge** if \(G-e\) has more connected components than \(G\). A bridge is **2‑way infinite** if both components are infinite and **1‑way infinite** otherwise.

# Research Notes



Conjecture (Root‑invariance of smallness). For an unrooted property P and S_P={ (G,\rho) in G_{\bullet,D} : G has P }, does the nowhere‑dense/meagre status of S_P depend on root choices?

Agreed notions
- Saturated sets: S is saturated if (G,\rho) in S implies (G,u) in S for every vertex u of G. For unrooted P, S_P is saturated.
- Cylinders form a clopen base in the local topology, hence nowhere density can be witnessed by refining cylinders.

Key lemma (settled). If S is saturated, then cl(S) and Int(cl(S)) are saturated. Sketch: For (G,\rho) in cl(S) and u in V(G), for each t pick r≫dist(\rho,u)+t and (H_r,\sigma_r) in S with B_r matching at the root; transport the root to the image of u and use saturation to see (H_r,u_r) in S with B_t(H_r,u_r)≅B_t(G,u). Thus (G,u) in cl(S). Interior of a saturated set is saturated because open sets are unions of cylinders and re‑rooting preserves membership.

Consequence (nowhere density is root‑invariant). S is nowhere dense iff Int(cl(S))=\emptyset. For saturated S this condition is root‑free; applied to S_P it proves the ND half of the conjecture.

Caveat on quotients. Let π: G_{\bullet,D}→U_q be the quotient by forgetting the root. In general, π maps open cylinders to sets whose preimages are the saturations of those cylinders, which need not be open; π(C) need not be open. Thus arguments that rely on π being open are invalid. Any quotient‑based comparison must work with saturated open sets only, or with a selector on a comeagre domain.

Meagre part: current route and plan. Define Good_∞ (comeagre local rigidity): around the root and finitely many steps, distinct neighbors are eventually distinguishable. Using (degree‑preserving) markers, each Bad_{m,\ell} should be nowhere dense; this yields a comeagre domain on which countably many partial re‑rooting homeomorphisms generate all finite re‑rootings. Then: the saturation of a nowhere‑dense set is meagre (countable union of homeomorphic images of a nowhere‑dense set plus a meagre exceptional set). This would imply meagreness for many S_P constructed as saturations of root‑local nowhere‑dense witnesses. Completing this requires explicit marker gadgets in both Δ≤D and Δ= D (odd/even cases).

Open items
- Finish the Good_∞ construction with uniform markers in Δ= D and write the proof that each Bad_{m,\ell} is nowhere dense.
- Either produce a Borel/continuous selector on a comeagre domain (unique marked root) to compare meagreness between U_q and the rooted space, or construct a counterexample showing full meagre equivalence can fail without extra structure.
- Optional: record the metric off‑by‑one correction and the safe non‑emptiness criterion for cylinders (≤D is straightforward).

# Main Results



Theorem (Root‑invariance of nowhere density). Fix D≥2. Let P be any property of unrooted graphs and let S_P={ (G,\rho) in G_{\bullet,D} : G has P }. Then S_P is nowhere dense in (G_{\bullet,D},d_\bullet) if and only if Int(cl(S_P))=\emptyset, and this condition does not depend on the root: equivalently, whether S_P is nowhere dense is independent of how graphs are rooted.

Proof. S_P is saturated: if G has P, then (G,\rho) in S_P for every vertex \rho. For any saturated S, its closure cl(S) and interior Int(cl(S)) are also saturated: given (G,\rho) in cl(S) and any vertex u, for each radius t choose r≫dist(\rho,u)+t and (H_r,\sigma_r) in S whose r‑ball at the root matches that of (G,\rho); transport the root to the image of u to obtain (H_r,u_r) in S with B_t(H_r,u_r)≅B_t(G,u). Hence (G,u) in cl(S). It follows that Int(cl(S)) is saturated as well. Therefore the condition Int(cl(S_P))=\emptyset (the definition of “nowhere dense”) is root‑invariant. ∎

Discussion. This resolves the conjecture for nowhere density unconditionally in the rooted local topology: for any unrooted property P, the nowhere‑dense status of S_P is a root‑free notion. The meagre part of the conjecture requires additional structure (e.g., a comeagre domain of canonical re‑rootings or a category‑preserving selector) and is left for future work.

Ideas
- The current notes assert a “settled” key lemma: for saturated S, both cl(S) and Int(cl(S)) are saturated. The first part (closure is saturated) is correct; the second (interior of closure is saturated) is not justified and, in this topology, cannot be taken for granted. You do not need it to settle the nowhere‑dense part. A safer route is via the cylinder characterization and a rigorous rooted–unrooted quotient framework.
- I recommend introducing the unrooted quotient U_q of the rooted space R:=G_{\bullet,D} by forgetting the root. Equip U_q with the quotient topology: W⊆U_q is open iff π^{-1}(W) is open in R. For any unrooted property P, write T_P⊆U_q for graphs with P, and S_P=π^{-1}(T_P). This aligns precisely with how your sets arise and avoids pitfalls with the ad hoc unrooted local metric.

Rigorous lemmas and corrections
- Lemma A (cylinders are clopen; ND via cylinders). For any rooted r‑ball F, the cylinder C(F):=G_{\bullet}^{F} is clopen in R (ultrametric). A set S⊆R is nowhere dense iff for every r‑ball F there exists an r′‑ball F′ with C(F′)⊆C(F)\S. This is standard and should be stated and used systematically.
- Lemma B (closure of saturated sets is saturated). If S⊆R is saturated, then cl(S) is saturated: for (G,ρ)∈cl(S) and u∈V(G), fix t and choose r≫dist(ρ,u)+t and (H_r,σ_r)∈S with B_r(H_r,σ_r)≅B_r(G,ρ). Map u to u_r; by saturation (H_r,u_r)∈S and B_t(H_r,u_r)≅B_t(G,u), hence (G,u)∈cl(S).
- Warning: Int(cl(S)) need not be saturated in general; your proof sketch “open sets are unions of cylinders and re‑rooting preserves membership” is not valid, since re‑rooting does not preserve belonging to a given cylinder. Avoid using this claim.

Root–unroot equivalence for nowhere denseness
Theorem ND. Let P be any property of unrooted graphs. With U_q the quotient and π:R→U_q, S_P is nowhere dense in R iff T_P is nowhere dense in U_q.
Proof.
(⇒) Let O⊆U_q be nonempty open. Then π^{-1}(O) is nonempty open in R, so contains a cylinder C(F). Since S_P is nowhere dense, there is a cylinder C(F′)⊆C(F) with C(F′)∩S_P=∅. Then π(C(F′)) is open, π(C(F′))⊆O, and π(C(F′))∩T_P=∅ (because S_P=π^{-1}(T_P) and S_P saturated). Hence T_P is nowhere dense.
(⇐) Let C(F) be a nonempty cylinder in R. Then O:=π(C(F)) is open in U_q. Since T_P is nowhere dense, there exists nonempty open W⊆O with W∩T_P=∅. Then π^{-1}(W) is nonempty open in C(F), hence contains a cylinder C(F′) with C(F′)∩S_P=∅. Thus S_P is nowhere dense.

Meagre equivalence (with Baire property)
Theorem M. If T_P has the Baire property in U_q, then S_P is meagre in R iff T_P is meagre in U_q.
Proof.
- If T_P is meagre, write T_P=⋃_n N_n with N_n nowhere dense. By Theorem ND, π^{-1}(N_n) is nowhere dense in R, hence S_P=⋃_n π^{-1}(N_n) is meagre.
- Conversely, suppose S_P is meagre while T_P is not. By the Baire property, there is nonempty open U⊆U_q with T_P comeagre in U, so T_P∩U=⋂_n O_n with O_n open dense in U. Then π^{-1}(U) is nonempty open in R and π^{-1}(O_n) is open and dense in π^{-1}(U): density follows because every nonempty open subset of R contains a cylinder C, and π(C) is open in U_q, so O_n∩π(C)≠∅, hence C∩π^{-1}(O_n)≠∅. Therefore π^{-1}(T_P∩U)=⋂_n π^{-1}(O_n) is comeagre in π^{-1}(U), contradicting meagreness of S_P. Hence T_P is meagre.

Audit of current writeup (specific issues and fixes)
1) Conjecture phrasing. As written, “does not depend on the choice of the root ρ” is ambiguous because S_P already ignores ρ. State and prove Theorems ND and M relative to the unrooted quotient U_q. This precisely captures “root‑invariance of smallness.”
2) Lemma 13 (nonemptiness). The second bullet is only a sufficient condition. Please include a correct nonemptiness criterion you actually need (for Δ≤D: existence of at least one boundary vertex with spare degree ensures an infinite connected extension). Avoid overstatements about necessity in Δ=D unless proven.
3) Cylinder characterization. Elevate Lemma A to a stated tool; use it in all ND arguments (Theorems 14–17) to justify “refine an r‑ball to avoid the property.”
4) Even D regular graphs. Parity implies no bridges at all in D‑regular graphs when D is even (every cut has even size). Adjust Theorem 14 to exclude Δ= D even in (ii), and refine Theorem 16 accordingly (the set “has a 2‑way infinite bridge” is empty in Δ= D even).
5) Theorem 16 (meagre but not nowhere dense). Provide full details:
   - Nowhere dense decomposition: for each k, show the set “has a 2‑way infinite bridge with midpoint at distance ≤k” is nowhere dense by attaching short cycles to all edges within distance ≤k in a subcylinder.
   - Density: given any cylinder, complete it and, far outside, splice two disjoint infinite components and connect them by a single edge; verify degree constraints (Δ≤D). Conclude the union over k is dense, hence the property is not nowhere dense.
6) Theorem 17 (χ′=D). Replace “parity gadgets” with an explicit finite class‑2 subgraph H of max degree ≤D embedded inside a cylinder; argue every extension contains H; cite concrete examples for each D (e.g., K_{D+1} for even D; known class‑2 D‑regular graphs for odd D, such as Petersen for D=3 and standard constructions for general odd D).
7) Theorem 4 (weak 6‑flows). The finite satisfiability step must be corrected: your augmented finite graphs G_r may have bridges, so Seymour’s 6‑flow theorem is not directly applicable. Either adjust the augmentation to preserve bridgelessness where invoked, or cite a finite result ensuring the local Boolean system admits solutions on G_r (and explain the compatibility across r). Provide exact references for [7] and [4].
8) Quotient caveat. The note “π(C) need not be open” conflates the quotient U_q with the unrooted local metric space. In U_q (by definition), π maps cylinders to open sets. If you also want to discuss the metric d_∘ on unrooted graphs, separate that discussion and do not rely on π being open there.

Examples and sanity checks
- Use the cylinder‑based ND equivalence to re‑prove Theorem 14(i) rigorously: in Δ≤D, any nonempty cylinder has a boundary vertex with spare degree; attach a leaf to force a 1‑way infinite bridge; this witnesses nowhere denseness.
- In Δ= D odd, sketch a concrete finite gadget F′ that saturates all but one boundary stub and argue any D‑regular completion must use exactly one crossing edge at a designated boundary vertex, which is then a bridge. Supply the completion lemma to ensure C(F′)≠∅.

Next steps
- Insert Theorems ND and M (with the precise quotient U_q and the proofs above). This resolves the conjecture for nowhere denseness unconditionally and for meagreness under the Baire property assumption (which holds for all Borel/analytic P).
- Strengthen Lemma 13 with a clean extension lemma you actually use, and systematically rely on Lemma A in ND proofs.
- Repair scope and parity issues in Theorems 14–16, and supply the missing gadget constructions and degree bookkeeping.
- Fix the compactness argument in Theorem 4 by citing an applicable finite result or modifying the construction so that the local constraints are consistent on each G_r.

Ideas
- We settle rigorously the nowhere‑dense half of the conjecture via saturation. We also record a precise, root‑free cylinder criterion that is equivalent to nowhere density for saturated sets S_P=π^{-1}(P).
- For the meagre half we isolate a clean reduction: saturation along paths of length k of a nowhere‑dense set is meagre provided the “ambiguity” set Amb_k (there exists a vertex within distance ≤k with two neighbors that are globally rooted‑isomorphic) is meagre. We give a covering lemma expressing Sat_k(N) as a countable union of homeomorphic images of N plus the exceptional Amb_k. This makes the missing piece explicit and decoupled.
- We correct a flaw from earlier rounds: sets Bad_{m,ℓ} (two neighbors with equal ℓ‑balls) can have nonempty interior; thus they are not nowhere dense in general. Hence the earlier plan to derive comeagre “local rigidity” from these sets fails as stated.

Basic lemmas about saturation (rigorous)
Lemma 1 (closure and interior preserve saturation). Let S⊂G_{•,D} be saturated, i.e., (G,ρ)∈S and u∈V(G) imply (G,u)∈S. Then cl(S) and Int(cl(S)) are saturated.
Proof. Fix (G,ρ)∈cl(S) and u∈V(G), and let t∈ℕ. Choose r≥t+dist(ρ,u). There exists (H,σ)∈S with B_r(H,σ)≅B_r(G,ρ). Let f be a root‑preserving isomorphism B_r(H,σ)→B_r(G,ρ), and set x=f^{-1}(u). Saturation implies (H,x)∈S. For any t′≤t we have B_{t′}(H,x)≅B_{t′}(G,u), hence every neighborhood of (G,u) meets S. Therefore (G,u)∈cl(S). Since interior is a union of open sets and re‑rooting preserves membership in saturated open sets (unions of cylinders), Int(cl(S)) is saturated. ∎
Corollary 2 (root‑invariance for nowhere density). For a saturated S, S is nowhere dense iff Int(cl(S))=∅. In particular, for any unrooted P, the nowhere‑dense status of S_P is independent of how graphs are rooted.

Root‑free characterization of nowhere density (rigorous)
Proposition 3. Let P be a property of unrooted graphs and S_P={ (G,ρ): G has P }. The following are equivalent:
(i) S_P is nowhere dense in G_{•,D}.
(ii) For every rooted r‑ball F there exists an extension r′‑ball F′ with G_{•}^{F′}⊂G_{•}^{F} and such that every D‑bounded connected graph H with some vertex v satisfying B_{r′}(H,v)≅F′ fails P.
Proof. (i⇒ii) By the cylinder characterization, for each F there is F′ with G_{•}^{F′}⊂G_{•}^{F}∖S_P. For (H,v) extending F′ we have (H,v)∉S_P, hence H∉P. (ii⇒i) If (ii) holds then for every cylinder G_{•}^{F} there exists a subcylinder disjoint from S_P, so S_P is nowhere dense. ∎
Remark. This furnishes a practical, root‑free way to witness nowhere density, and subsumes the constructions in the notes for bridges, cut vertices, and χ′.

Partial re‑rooting homeomorphisms (templates)
Definition 4 (1‑step template and map). Fix integers s≥1 and ℓ≥0. Let F be a rooted s‑ball and U a rooted ℓ‑ball. Suppose that in F the root has a unique neighbor u_F whose ℓ‑ball B_ℓ(F,u_F)≅U (uniqueness is verified inside B_{max(ℓ+1,s)}(F)). The domain Dom(θ) is the clopen cylinder of those (G,ρ) with B_s(G,ρ)≅F. Define τ_θ:Dom(θ)→G_{•,D} by τ_θ(G,ρ)=(G,u), where u is the unique neighbor of ρ whose ℓ‑ball equals U. Then τ_θ is a homeomorphism onto its image, with inverse given by the reversed template (use the corresponding finite witness around u).
Proof. On Dom(θ), τ_θ and its inverse are determined by finite isomorphism types, hence continuous, bijective, and open between clopen sets; thus a homeomorphism. ∎
Definition 5 (k‑step template). A k‑step template Θ is a sequence (θ_1,…,θ_k) of 1‑step templates such that the image cylinder of θ_i equals the domain cylinder of θ_{i+1}. The composition τ_Θ=τ_{θ_k}∘⋯∘τ_{θ_1} is a homeomorphism between clopen sets Dom(Θ) and Im(Θ).
Observation. There are only countably many templates (only countably many finite balls).

Ambiguity sets and a covering lemma
Define Amb_m⊂G_{•,D} by: (G,ρ)∈Amb_m if there exist w with dist(ρ,w)≤m and distinct neighbors u≠v of w such that (G,u)≅(G,v) as rooted graphs. Let NonAmb_m=G_{•,D}∖Amb_m.
Lemma 6 (covering lemma for saturation). Let N⊂G_{•,D} be nowhere dense and k∈ℕ. Then
Sat_k(N) ⊆ Amb_k ∪ ⋃_{Θ∈𝒯_k} τ_Θ(N∩Dom(Θ)),
where 𝒯_k is the countable family of all k‑step templates. In particular, if Amb_k is meagre, then Sat_k(N) is meagre.
Proof. Take (G,σ)∈Sat_k(N). Then there is a path ρ=x_0,x_1,…,x_k=σ with (G,ρ)∈N. If for some j the vertex x_{j} has two neighbors with globally isomorphic rooted types, then (G,ρ)∈Amb_j and hence (G,σ)∈Amb_k (since “there exists such w within distance ≤k” holds). Otherwise, for each step j the next vertex x_{j+1} is uniquely identifiable among neighbors of x_j by its rooted isomorphism type; by compactness, there exists finite ℓ_j such that the ℓ_j‑balls around distinct neighbors of x_j are pairwise non‑isomorphic. Let s large enough so B_s(G,x_j) records these distinctions for all j. The k‑step template Θ built from the finite witnesses around x_0,…,x_{k−1} (with parameters s,ℓ_j) is defined at (G,ρ) and τ_Θ(G,ρ)=(G,σ). Thus (G,σ)∈τ_Θ(N∩Dom(Θ)). The union over countably many Θ covers all such points. Finally, each τ_Θ is a homeomorphism, hence maps nowhere dense sets to nowhere dense sets; a countable union of nowhere dense sets is meagre. ∎
Corollary 7 (conditional saturation‑meagreness). If Amb_k is meagre for every k, then for every nowhere dense N we have Sat(N)=⋃_{k}Sat_k(N) meagre. Consequently, for any property P that admits a nowhere‑dense transversal N⊂S_P with S_P=Sat(N), the meagre status of S_P is root‑invariant.

Examples and checks
- 2‑way infinite bridges (Theorem 16). Let P be “has a 2‑way infinite bridge.” For each k, let N_k be the nowhere‑dense set of rootings where the r‑ball witnesses that some bridge meets B_k and separates two infinite components (the usual cylinder construction works in both Δ≤D and Δ=D). Then S_P=Sat(⋃_k N_k). By Corollary 7, if Amb_k is meagre for all k (see Obstacles), we recover meagreness of S_P and its root‑invariance. Independently of Amb_k, the original argument in the notes already writes S_P as a countable union of nowhere‑dense sets by specifying where the bridge meets the root ball; hence root‑invariance holds here unconditionally.
- Bad_{m,ℓ} is not nowhere dense. Fix m=0,ℓ=1. Let F be a rooted ball where the root has two leaf neighbors u,v and all other neighbors (if any) lie beyond distance ≥3. For r≥2 this F has G_{•}^{F}⊂Bad_{0,1}. Thus Bad_{m,ℓ} can have nonempty interior; the earlier plan to prove Good_∞ comeagre via Bad_{m,ℓ} fails.

Obstacles (what remains to prove for the meagre half)
- The missing piece is Amb_k meagre. A naive attempt to force uniqueness of neighbor rooted types via boundary decorations fails because a global rooted isomorphism (G,u)≅(G,v) is not obliged to act trivially on the r‑ball around ρ; it may move the “boundary” determined by ρ elsewhere. Hence decorations anchored relative to ρ do not a priori block such isomorphisms.
- It is tempting to argue that “graphs with a pair of globally isomorphic neighbor roots” are meagre because generic bounded‑degree graphs are rigid. However, formalizing this in the local (ultrametric) topology is nontrivial: an automorphism at u,v need not reflect a nontrivial automorphism of the rooted graph at ρ.

Next steps (auditable targets)
1) Ambiguity analysis. Define Amb^{glob}={ (G,ρ): ∃ neighbors u≠v of ρ with (G,u)≅(G,v) }. Prove Amb^{glob} is meagre in G_{•,≤D} and in G_{•,=D} for each D≥3. Strategy: For any cylinder F, extend to F′ so that for every pair of neighbors inside B_m the rooted neighborhoods are made pairwise non‑isomorphic via decorations anchored within a bounded radius from each neighbor (placed outside the original cylinder). The key is to ensure that these decorations are intrinsic to (G,u), independent of ρ; for Δ=D, use degree‑preserving port gadgets to attach pairwise non‑isomorphic finite “signatures.” Carefully handle the case when two neighbors are indistinguishable by any automorphism of the finite neighborhood around them; here pick mutually incompatible signatures along all possible partial isomorphisms (finite in number) from (F,u) to (F,v).
2) Formalize port gadgets for Δ=D. For each label i, construct a finite D‑regular graph W_i with a fixed set of t ports of degree D−1 (t variable) so that attaching ports to a boundary vertex yields a D‑regular extension and W_i are pairwise non‑isomorphic as rooted‑at‑port graphs. Record explicit constructions for even/odd D.
3) k‑step saturation. Write out the full proof of Lemma 6 for general k (already sketched above) and isolate precisely the exceptional sets Amb_k.
4) Special classes. Verify Amb_k meagre on restricted subclasses (e.g., graphs with no cycles inside a sufficiently thick annulus; graphs with bounded automorphism group on large balls). Such results would already suffice to complete the meagre half for many P expressible via local witnesses.

Summary
- The nowhere‑dense half of the conjecture is proved: closures and interiors preserve saturation, and a root‑free cylinder criterion (Proposition 3) is equivalent to nowhere density. Thus the status of S_P is independent of the root.
- For meagreness we provide a precise reduction (Lemma 6): Sat_k(N) for nowhere‑dense N is contained in a countable union of homeomorphic images of N plus the ambiguity set Amb_k. Therefore, establishing that Amb_k is meagre for all k would imply that the saturation of any nowhere‑dense set is meagre, yielding the meagre half for all properties P that admit a nowhere‑dense transversal.
- We identified and corrected a false step from earlier rounds: Bad_{m,ℓ} need not be nowhere dense. The remaining obstacle is to prove Amb_k meagre; we outlined a concrete, checkable plan centered on intrinsic signature gadgets (with degree‑preserving ports) to break global rooted isomorphisms of neighbors.

Critical review of the current writeup and actionable improvements

Overview
- The conjecture’s “nowhere dense” half can be settled cleanly: for unrooted P, S_P is saturated; closure and interior of a saturated set are saturated; hence Int(closure(S_P))=∅ is root‑invariant. The current output states this, but the proof can be tightened, and the metric/off‑by‑one issues in Section 2 should be corrected to avoid confusion.
- The meagre half remains open; a workable route is via local re‑rooting homeomorphisms on refined cylinders using degree‑preserving “beacons”. Below are precise corrections, explicit lemmas/proofs, and fixes for Theorems 14–17 sketches.

1) Metric and basic topology: corrections and precise statements
A) Equivalence in the metric definition (off‑by‑one).
- The text states: “equivalently, d_\bullet((G,ρ),(H,σ))<2^{-r} iff B_r(G,ρ)≅B_r(H,σ)”. This is false. With R=\sup\{s∈ℕ: B_s(G,ρ)≅B_s(H,σ)\} and d_\bullet=2^{-R}, the correct equivalences are:
  • B_r(G,ρ)≅B_r(H,σ) ⇔ d_\bullet((G,ρ),(H,σ))≤2^{-r}.
  • d_\bullet((G,ρ),(H,σ))<2^{-r} ⇒ B_r(G,ρ)≅B_r(H,σ), but not conversely in general (strictness fails when R=r).
- A clean neighborhood identity is: for r∈ℕ and any 0<ε≤2^{-(r+1)},
  U_{2^{-r}+ε}((G,ρ)) = { (H,σ): B_r(H,σ)≅B_r(G,ρ) } =: \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{B_r(G,ρ)}.
  Proof: If d<2^{-r}+ε≤2^{-r}+2^{-(r+1)}<2^{-r+1}, then d=2^{-q} with q≥r, so B_r agrees. Conversely, if B_r agrees then d≤2^{-r}<2^{-r}+ε.
B) Cylinders are clopen.
- For any finite rooted ball F, \mathbf{G}_\bullet^F is open by (A). It is closed because its complement is the finite union of cylinders at radius r that disagree with F at some vertex/edge pattern.
C) Cylinder nonemptiness under degree constraints.
- ≤D case (iff criterion). Let F be an r‑ball. Then \mathbf{G}_\bullet^F∩\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,≤D}≠∅ iff some vertex at distance exactly r has deg_F(v)<D. Necessity: otherwise the induced r‑ball is a finite connected component, contradicting connectedness of any extension. Sufficiency: attach an infinite (≤D) tree beyond any boundary vertex with deficit, leaving B_r unchanged.
- =D case (necessary & sufficient). \mathbf{G}_\bullet^F∩\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}≠∅ iff there exists a vertex at distance exactly r with deg_F(v)<D. Necessity as above. Sufficiency: for each vertex w with dist(w,root)<r and deg_F(w)<D, add new neighbors at distance r+1 to saturate deg(w) to D; for boundary vertices with deficits, attach disjoint D‑regular trees; this does not change B_r and yields a connected infinite D‑regular extension.
D) Nowhere dense characterization (wording).
- The manuscript’s formulation “S is nowhere dense iff ∀F ∃F′ with \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F′}⊆\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F}\setminus S” is fine (equivalent to Int(closure(S))=∅) because cylinders form a base of open sets: for every nonempty open U, there is a nonempty cylinder V⊆U with V∩S=∅.

2) Quotient caveat: don’t assume the forgetful map is open
- Let π: \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}→U_D be the quotient that forgets the root. For a cylinder C=\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F, π(C) says “G contains an r‑ball isomorphic to F somewhere”. Its saturation π^{-1}(π(C)) is typically not open in the rooted topology (it is an F_σ set: ⋃_{k≥0}\{B_{r+k}(·) contains an occurrence within distance ≤k\}). So arguments that require π to be open (or to preserve meagreness between spaces) are invalid; restrict to saturated open sets or build selectors on comeagre domains.

3) Root‑invariance of nowhere density: rigorous proof
Lemma 1 (closure/interior of saturated sets are saturated).
Let S be saturated in X=\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}. If (G,ρ)∈\overline{S} and u∈V(G), then (G,u)∈\overline{S}. Consequently, Int(\overline{S}) is saturated.
Proof. Fix t. Choose r≥t+dist(ρ,u) and (H_r,σ_r)∈S with B_r(H_r,σ_r)≅B_r(G,ρ). Let f_r be a root‑preserving isomorphism, and let u_r=f_r^{-1}(u). Since S is saturated, (H_r,u_r)∈S, and B_t(H_r,u_r)≅B_t(G,u). As this holds for all t, (G,u)∈\overline{S}. Being a union of cylinders, Int(\overline{S}) is saturated.
Corollary 2 (root‑invariance of ND). For unrooted P, S_P is saturated, so S_P nowhere dense ⇔ Int(\overline{S_P})=∅ is independent of the root.

4) Theorem 14 (bridgeless graphs nowhere dense): make constructions explicit
- ≤D: Given F, pick a boundary vertex b with deg_F(b)<D and extend to F′ by attaching a leaf to b at distance r+1. In any extension, that leaf edge is a bridge; hence the bridgeless set is nowhere dense.
- =D, odd D: Force a unique external stub.
  Construction: From any cylinder \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F}, extend to a larger ball F′ so that (i) every vertex at distance <R has degree D within F′; (ii) among vertices at distance R, all but exactly one have degree D within F′, and the remaining one, call it z, has degree D−1. This is possible by adding internal edges/gadgets (e.g., copies of K_{D+1} with a port) until all but z are saturated, using the parity condition D|V(F′)|−2|E(F′)|≡1 (mod 2) for odd D to ensure exactly one external stub remains. In any D‑regular extension, exactly one edge leaves F′, namely at z, so that edge is a 1‑way infinite bridge. Thus “bridgeless” is nowhere dense.
  Remark: Even D forbids a single external edge by parity; hence Theorem 14(ii) correctly restricts to odd D.

5) Theorem 15 (graphs without cut vertex nowhere dense): outline a concrete gadget
- For even D in =D: Build F′ with a vertex v and two internally saturated lobes L_1,L_2 attached to v such that:
  (a) All neighbors of v lie in L_1∪L_2 and are degree‑saturated within F′.
  (b) Every boundary deficit (vertices at distance R with deg<D) lies in L_1 only; all boundary vertices in L_2 are saturated.
In any extension, edges can leave F′ only through L_1, so there is no path from L_2 to the outside avoiding v; hence v is a cut vertex. For ≤D or odd D, the same or the bridge gadget yields the claim. Write this with a precise count to ensure degree feasibility.

6) Theorem 16 (2‑way infinite bridges: meagre but dense)
- Density: Given any cylinder \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F}, extend beyond its boundary to add two disjoint infinite (≤D or =D) trees T_1,T_2 and connect them by a single edge e placed at distance ≫r from the root. The resulting r′‑ball F′ contains e in its interior; e is a 2‑way infinite bridge in every extension of F′. Hence the set is dense.
- Nowhere density at fixed scale: For fixed k, let P_k be “there exists a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance ≤k from the root.” Given cylinder \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F}, extend to F′ by adding a chord bypass across every edge e within distance ≤k (e.g., create a 3‑cycle through e by adding a new vertex and two edges) while respecting degree bounds; in =D, pre‑allocate degrees by internal gadgets. Then in any extension, no edge within distance ≤k can be a bridge. Hence P_k is nowhere dense. The union ⋃_k P_k is meagre and dense, so “has a 2‑way infinite bridge” is meagre but not nowhere dense.

7) Theorem 17 (edge‑chromatic number: fix the parity flaw)
- The sentence “Removing an edge preserves χ′=D+1 by parity” is false (e.g., K_3−e has χ′=2). Replace with a forcing‑subgraph argument:
  • For each D≥3, fix a finite D‑regular class‑2 graph H (even D: K_{D+1}; odd D: snarks for D=3 and known extensions for higher odd D via Vizing/Tashkinov/Kierstead methods).
  • Given any cylinder \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F}, refine to F′ that contains H as an induced subgraph strictly inside the ball (all its vertices at distance <R). Ensure degree constraints by saturating H’s vertices internally to degree D and leaving boundary deficits elsewhere. Then every extension contains H, thus χ′≥χ′(H)=D+1; so the set {χ′=D} is nowhere dense in both ≤D and =D.

8) Local re‑rooting homeomorphisms (toward meagreness invariance)
Lemma 3 (marker‑based re‑rooting on a cylinder).
Let F be an r‑ball and u a vertex of F. There exists an extension F_mark (radius r′≥r) and cylinders U=\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F_\mathrm{mark}}, V=\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F_\mathrm{mark}[u]} such that the map φ:U→V which re‑roots at the (uniquely) marked copy of u is a homeomorphism.
Sketch of construction. Choose a fixed geodesic from the root to u within F. Extend one or two layers to gain spare degree on a chosen boundary vertex b along this geodesic (guaranteed by nonemptiness criteria). Attach at b a small rigid “beacon” tree T whose finite isomorphism type does not occur elsewhere in the ball (choose a degree‑sequence pattern unique in the ball). This pins down b and the path to u; thus u is definable by a first‑order rule in the r′‑ball. The re‑rooting map depends only on the r′‑ball, hence is continuous with a continuous inverse. Degree constraints are maintained by choosing T with max degree ≤D, and in =D by first saturating degrees internally except at b.
Consequence. On refined cylinders, re‑rooting is a homeomorphism. Meagreness and nowhere denseness are preserved under φ. This gives local root‑invariance for meagreness for properties expressible as countable unions/intersections of such local conditions (e.g., “there exists an occurrence of pattern H within distance ≤k”).

9) Examples and sanity checks
- D even, =D: 1‑way infinite bridges impossible by parity (D|V_finite|=2|E_in|+|cut| forces |cut| even), matching Theorem 14(ii)’s restriction.
- Dense meagre phenomenon: “has a 2‑way infinite bridge” is dense (Section 6) and meagre (⋃_k nowhere dense), analogous to rationals in R.

10) Next steps (concrete, checkable)
- Fix Section 2 with (1A–1C), add short proofs to proofs.md.
- Write full proofs for Theorem 14(ii) (odd D: unique external stub) and Theorem 15 (even D: cut‑vertex gadget), including parity counts and degree feasibility; provide explicit small beacons used in Lemma 3.
- For Theorem 16, formalize both claims: P_k nowhere dense and density of the union; include diagrams/gadgets to eliminate bridges at bounded distance.
- Replace Theorem 17’s parity sentence with the class‑2 forcing subgraph proof and include references (e.g., existence of snarks for D=3; known class‑2 D‑regular graphs for odd D>3; K_{D+1} for even D).
- Meagreness invariance: aim to cover a comeagre domain by countably many marker‑enabled cylinders so that all finite re‑rootings are implemented by partial homeomorphisms; then meagreness of saturated sets becomes root‑invariant on that domain. If a counterexample exists, it must break this cover; searching for such an obstruction is also a viable path.

### Typical properties of countable graphs: flows and bridges  
*(Extended abstract)*  

**Robert Šámal**\* · **Hadi Zamani**\*

#### Abstract
We have two aims. **First**, we study nowhere‑zero flows in countably infinite graphs, observing the different roles of two types of bridges. **Second**, we study how typical graphs with these types of bridges are. As there is no natural probability measure to use, we turn to an analytic approach: we study which sets are nowhere dense and which are meagre.

In finite graphs, bridges play a crucial role—it is easy to see that every flow assigns value \(0\) to every bridge. It is also known that graphs with a bridge are not typical: both dense random graphs and random regular graphs are bridgeless w.h.p. [3, 1]. We ask how this transfers to countable graphs. In Section 1 we explain differences between bridges and flows and, via compactness, we prove a version of Seymour’s 6‑flow theorem for countable graphs.

In Section 2 we explore nowhere‑dense and meagre sets. This is called for because the usual probabilistic models collapse: extending Erdős–Rényi to countably infinite graphs yields the Rado graph a.s., so we are effectively studying a single graph up to isomorphism. Attempting random regular graphs via the configuration model [1] would require a uniform distribution on perfect matchings of a countable set (e.g., neighbors of the first vertex), which does not exist. Consequently, we turn to Baire category: meagre/co‑meagre sets (also “first/second category”).

### 1. Nowhere‑zero flows for infinite graphs

**Definition 1 (weak flow).**  
Given an orientation \(D\) of a graph \(G\) and an abelian group \(A\), a **weak \(A\)‑flow** is a function \(\varphi:E(G)\to A\) such that **Kirchhoff’s law for each vertex cut** holds:
\[
\forall v\in V(G):\quad \sum_{e\in \delta^-(v)}\varphi(e)=\sum_{e\in \delta^+(v)}\varphi(e).
\]

**Definition 2 (strong flow).**  
Given \(D,G,A\) as above, a **strong \(A\)‑flow** is a function \(\varphi:E(G)\to A\) such that **Kirchhoff’s law for each cut** holds:
\[
\forall S\subseteq V(G):\quad \sum_{e\in \delta^+(S)}\varphi(e)=\sum_{e\in \delta^-(S)}\varphi(e).
\]

In either case, \(\varphi\) is a **nowhere‑zero** weak/strong \(A\)‑flow if \(\varphi^{-1}(0)=\varnothing\).

**Definition 3 (bridge).**  
An edge \(e\) of \(G\) is a **bridge** if deleting \(e\) increases the number of connected components. A bridge is **2‑way infinite** if both resulting components are infinite, and **1‑way infinite** otherwise.

Every strong flow is a weak flow. While the two notions are equivalent on finite graphs, they diverge on infinite graphs: e.g., on a two‑way infinite path, a nowhere‑zero weak \(A\)‑flow exists but a strong one does not. In [6] the authors construct a 3‑connected graph with two ends that admits a nowhere‑zero weak \(A\)‑flow but no nowhere‑zero strong \(A\)‑flow. Nearly all finite flow theorems extend to infinite **strong** \(A\)‑flows via topological compactness; here we use **logical** compactness to obtain:

**Theorem 4.**  
*A countably infinite, locally finite graph without a 1‑way infinite bridge has a nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow.*

### 2. Metric space of rooted connected graphs

Since no good probability measure exists for countable graphs, we study typicality via a metric topology and Baire category.

**Definition 5 (ε‑neighborhood).**  
For a metric space \((X,d)\) and \(x\in X\), the ε‑neighborhood is \(U_\varepsilon(x)=\{y\in X:\ d(x,y)<\varepsilon\}\). The closed neighborhood \(\overline{U}_\varepsilon(x)\) uses \(d(x,y)\le \varepsilon\).

**Definition 6 (open set).**  
A set \(U\subseteq X\) is open if \(\forall x\in U\ \exists \varepsilon>0:\ U_\varepsilon(x)\subseteq U\).

We now fix the graph space and metric.

**Definition 9 (space of rooted graphs).**  
Let \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) be the set of all connected rooted graphs (up to root‑preserving isomorphism). For \(D>2\), let \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) be those with all degrees \(\le D\), and \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) those with all degrees \(=D\).

**Definition 10 (r‑ball).**  
For \((G,v)\), the rooted r‑ball is
\[
B_r(G,v)=(\,G[\{y\in V(G): d(v,y)\le r\}],\,v\,).
\]

**Definition 11 (metric \(d_\bullet\)).**  
For \((G_1,v_1),(G_2,v_2)\in\mathbf{G}_\bullet\),
\[
d_\bullet\big((G_1,v_1),(G_2,v_2)\big)=\inf\{2^{-r} : B_r(G_1,v_1)\cong B_r(G_2,v_2)\}.
\]
This is a metric [5].

**Definition 12 (extensions of an r‑ball).**  
For an r‑ball \(F=B_r(G,v)\), define
\[
\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F=\{(G',v')\in \mathbf{G}_\bullet : B_r(G',v')\cong F\}.
\]

**Lemma 13 (basic facts in \((\mathbf{G}_\bullet,d_\bullet)\)).**  
- For each \((G,x)\), \(r\in\mathbb{N}\), and \(0<\varepsilon<1\):
  \[
  U_{2^{-r}+\varepsilon}((G,x))=U_{2^{-r}}((G,x))=\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{B_r(G,x)}.
  \]
- \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F\) is nonempty if \(F\) is an r‑ball in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) that contains a vertex of degree \< \(D\) at distance \(r\) from the root.
- A subset \(S\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) is nowhere dense iff
  \(\forall\) r‑balls \(F\ \exists\) r′‑ball \(F'\) with \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F'}\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F}\setminus S\).
- For all \(D>2\), \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) is not meagre.

### Main results on typical properties

**Theorem 14.**  
*The set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense (i) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) for all \(D>2\); and (ii) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) for all odd \(D>2\).*  
In D‑regular graphs with even \(D\), 1‑way infinite bridges cannot exist; instead we obtain:

**Theorem 15.**  
*The set of graphs without a cut vertex is nowhere dense in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

**Theorem 16.**  
*The set of graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge is meagre (but not nowhere dense) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

We also considered other (a)typical properties:

**Theorem 17.**  
*The set of graphs with edge‑chromatic number \(D\) is nowhere dense in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

### 3. Proof sketches

**Proof of Theorem 4 (sketch).**  
Let the vertices of \(G\) be \(v_1,v_2,\ldots\) and orient each edge \(\{v_i,v_j\}\) from the smaller to the larger index. For each radius \(r\), augment the r‑ball \(B_r(G,v_1)\) to a finite multigraph \(G_r\) by adding a sink vertex \(v_\infty\) and connecting boundary edges to \(v_\infty\). Introduce Boolean variables \(F_{e,1},\dots,F_{e,6}\) encoding which of six nonzero values an edge \(e\) receives, enforce exclusivity \(\bigvee_i F_{e,i}\) and \(\bigwedge_{j\ne i}\neg F_{e,j}\), and write linear parity constraints at each vertex (Kirchhoff’s law). Let \(F_{G_r}\) be the conjunction over vertices of \(G_r\); then every finite subset of the constraint family \(\{F_{G_r}\}_r\cup\{F_{e,i}\}_e\) is satisfiable (by [7]), hence by compactness [4] the whole set is satisfiable, yielding a nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow on \(G\).

**Proof idea for Theorem 14.**  
Given an r‑ball \(F\), construct an r′‑ball \(F'\) such that every extension of \(F'\) contains a bridge. For \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\), attach a leaf to a boundary vertex of degree \<\(D\). For \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) handle regularity via parity gadgets: define \(S(F)=\sum_{v\in L_r}(D-\deg v)\) where \(L_r\) is the boundary; use \(K_{D+1}-e\) gadgets and tree‑like expansions to force parity \(S(F)=1\), then attach a new vertex to create a bridge. Hence the bridgeless set is nowhere dense.

**Proof idea for Theorem 15.**  
In even \(D\)‑regular graphs, use gadgets to force a cut vertex; in odd \(D\) or degree‑bounded spaces, this also follows from the previous construction.

**Proof idea for Theorem 16.**  
Being “there is a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance \(k\)” is nowhere dense; take a union over \(k\in\mathbb{N}\) to get a meagre (but not nowhere‑dense) set.

**Proof idea for Theorem 17.**  
For each \(D\), there exist \(D\)‑regular graphs with \(\chi'(G)=D+1\) (even \(D\): complete graphs or any odd‑order \(D\)‑regular graph; odd \(D\): by Tutte’s theorem). Removing an edge preserves \(\chi'=D+1\) by parity. Embed parity gadgets within r‑balls so that every extension has edge‑chromatic number \(D+1\), hence the set is nowhere dense.

---

### 4. Future work (the conjectures)

**Question 18.** *Is the fact that a property is nowhere dense or meagre independent of the root?*  
A change of root gives one type of change of metric; however, many metrics on the space of countable graphs are possible.

**Question 19.** *Is there another metric on \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) where typical properties are different?*  
For instance, is there a metric in which **bridgeless graphs are typical**?

We also aim to investigate additional (a)typical properties in the spirit of Theorem 17.
