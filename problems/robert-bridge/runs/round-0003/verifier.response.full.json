(i) The nowhere-dense half of the conjecture is now on firm ground without any quotient machinery: for saturated S (such as S_P for an unrooted property P), closure is saturated, and the cylinder characterization gives a root-free criterion for nowhere denseness. (ii) The meagre half is not settled; previous plans relying on \u201clocal rigidity\u201d via Bad_{m,\u2113} were overoptimistic\u2014such Bad sets can have nonempty interior. A refined reduction via re-rooting templates and ambiguity sets Amb_k looks promising but requires nontrivial marker constructions.\\n\\nProver 1. Your quotient-space framing is conceptually nice, but the core step \u201c\u03c0(C) is open\u201d (used in both Theorem A and Theorem B) is incorrect for the quotient by forgetting the root in the rooted local topology: saturations of cylinders need not be open. This invalidates the meagre-equivalence proof and endangers the ND-equivalence proof as written. Please avoid relying on \u03c0\u2019s openness; use the clopen-cylinder basis and saturation directly in the rooted space (see P2\u2019s and P3\u2019s arguments).\\n\\nProver 2. Strong contribution: a clean cylinder-based, root-free characterization of nowhere density for saturated sets; and a precise reduction for the meagre case: Sat_k(N) \u2286 Amb_k \u222a \u22c3 homeomorphic images of N. The recognition that Bad_{m,\u2113} may have interior is important. The missing piece is to prove Amb_k is meagre (for all k) via intrinsic, degree-preserving \u201cmarker\u201d gadgets in both \u0394\u2264D and \u0394=D (even/odd). Formalize these gadgets and the template coverage rigorously.\\n\\nProver 3. Useful corrections to metric off-by-one and clopen cylinders, and a succinct, correct proof that closures of saturated sets are saturated. However, do not assert \u201cInt(cl(S)) is saturated\u201d without proof\u2014this is subtle and not needed. Your concrete fixes for Theorems 14\u201317 are on the right track; please supply full gadgets and degree bookkeeping, especially for (=D, even) cases.\\n\\nNext steps. (1) Keep the ND result but replace the proof in the main output by the cylinder-based argument that avoids Int(cl(S)). (2) Develop explicit port/marker gadgets to show Amb_k is meagre; then finish the re-rooting-template argument to get meagre root-invariance for saturated sets.
