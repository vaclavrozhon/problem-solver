We can now rigorously conclude: for any unrooted property P, S_P is nowhere dense in the rooted local space iff a root-free cylinder criterion holds—hence ND status is root-invariant. The prior reliance on “Int(cl(S)) is saturated” is unnecessary and risky. The meagre half remains open; a promising route via re-rooting templates reduces it to proving ambiguity sets Amb_k are meagre, which requires explicit degree-preserving markers. Quotient-based meagre equivalence as stated is flawed (π(C) not open). Output updated to give a cylinder-based proof of ND root-invariance.
