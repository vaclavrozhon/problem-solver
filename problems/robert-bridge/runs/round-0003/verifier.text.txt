{"feedback_md":"Key points. (i) The nowhere-dense half of the conjecture is now on firm ground without any quotient machinery: for saturated S (such as S_P for an unrooted property P), closure is saturated, and the cylinder characterization gives a root-free criterion for nowhere denseness. (ii) The meagre half is not settled; previous plans relying on “local rigidity” via Bad_{m,ℓ} were overoptimistic—such Bad sets can have nonempty interior. A refined reduction via re-rooting templates and ambiguity sets Amb_k looks promising but requires nontrivial marker constructions.\n\nProver 1. Your quotient-space framing is conceptually nice, but the core step “π(C) is open” (used in both Theorem A and Theorem B) is incorrect for the quotient by forgetting the root in the rooted local topology: saturations of cylinders need not be open. This invalidates the meagre-equivalence proof and endangers the ND-equivalence proof as written. Please avoid relying on π’s openness; use the clopen-cylinder basis and saturation directly in the rooted space (see P2’s and P3’s arguments).\n\nProver 2. Strong contribution: a clean cylinder-based, root-free characterization of nowhere density for saturated sets; and a precise reduction for the meagre case: Sat_k(N) ⊆ Amb_k ∪ ⋃ homeomorphic images of N. The recognition that Bad_{m,ℓ} may have interior is important. The missing piece is to prove Amb_k is meagre (for all k) via intrinsic, degree-preserving “marker” gadgets in both Δ≤D and Δ=D (even/odd). Formalize these gadgets and the template coverage rigorously.\n\nProver 3. Useful corrections to metric off-by-one and clopen cylinders, and a succinct, correct proof that closures of saturated sets are saturated. However, do not assert “Int(cl(S)) is saturated” without proof—this is subtle and not needed. Your concrete fixes for Theorems 14–17 are on the right track; please supply full gadgets and degree bookkeeping, especially for (=D, even) cases.\n\nNext steps. (1) Keep the ND result but replace the proof in the main output by the cylinder-based argument that avoids Int(cl(S)). (2) Develop explicit port/marker gadgets to show Amb_k is meagre; then finish the re-rooting-template argument to get meagre root-invariance for saturated sets. (3) Repair statements about regular even D (no bridges) and provide full proofs for Theorems 14–17 with parity checks and completion lemmas. (4) Either complete or retract the quotient-space meagre equivalence.\n","summary_md":"We can now rigorously conclude: for any unrooted property P, S_P is nowhere dense in the rooted local space iff a root-free cylinder criterion holds—hence ND status is root-invariant.

Let P be any property of unrooted graphs and let S_P={ (G,\\rho) in G_{\\bullet,D} : G has P }. Then S_P is nowhere dense in (G_{\\bullet,D},d_\\bullet) if and only if the following equivalent, root-free condition holds:\nFor every rooted r-ball F there exists an extension r′-ball F′ with G_{\\bullet}^{F′}⊆G_{\\bullet}^{F} such that for every D-bounded connected graph H and vertex v with B_{r′}(H,v)≅F′, the unrooted graph H does not have P.\nIn particular, whether S_P is nowhere dense does not depend on how graphs are rooted.\n\nProof. Cylinders G_{\\bullet}^{F} form a clopen base of the local topology. If S_P is nowhere dense, then for each r-ball F there exists a subcylinder G_{\\bullet}^{F′}⊆G_{\\bullet}^{F} with G_{\\bullet}^{F′}∩S_P=\\emptyset. Hence any (H,v) whose r′-ball equals F′ lies outside S_P, so H fails P. Conversely, if such F′ exists for each F, then every nonempty cylinder contains a subcylinder disjoint from S_P, which is equivalent to S_P being nowhere dense. This criterion refers only to P and D, not to a chosen root, establishing root-invariance. ∎\n\nNote. The meagre part of the conjecture remains open in full generality. A promising route proceeds via covering the re-root saturations of nowhere-dense sets by countably many homeomorphic images plus a small ambiguity set; proving that the ambiguity set is meagre (via degree-preserving marker gadgets) would settle meagre root-invariance for broad classes of properties."}}
