Keep that and remove reliance on Int(cl(S)).\\n- Several claims in Notes remain problematic: (i) \u201cInt(cl(S)) is saturated\u201d is unproven and likely false in general; it is also unnecessary. (ii) Quotient\u2011map comments are partially right, but the justification needs a concrete counterexample showing that the saturation of a cylinder need not be open. (iii) There are parity/scope errors in statements about bridges in D\u2011regular graphs. (iv) The meagre plan still lacks concrete, verifiable gadgets and a precise ambiguity\u2011set analysis.\\n\\nSpecific gaps, errors, and corrective lemmas\\n1) On \u201cInt(cl(S)) is saturated.\u201d\\n- The given sketch is invalid: re\u2011rooting does not preserve membership in a cylinder, and open sets are unions of cylinders. Hence, from (G,\u03c1) \u2208 Int(cl(S)) it does not follow that (G,u) \u2208 Int(cl(S)). You do not need this statement for the ND result. Remove it; keep only \u201ccl(S) is saturated,\u201d which is true and used below.\\n- What you can safely use: closure of a saturated set is saturated.\\n  Proof. If S is saturated and (G,\u03c1) \u2208 cl(S), then for any vertex u and radius t there exists r\u226bdist(\u03c1,u)+t and (H_r,\u03c3_r) \u2208 S with B_r(H_r,\u03c3_r) \u2245 B_r(G,\u03c1). Let u_r be the image of u; saturation gives (H_r,u_r) \u2208 S and B_t(H_r,u_r) \u2245 B_t(G,u), so (G,u) \u2208 cl(S).\\n\\n2) Cylinder characterization of nowhere denseness (use this everywhere).\\n- Cylinders C(F):=G_{\u2022}^{F} are clopen in the rooted ultrametric space. A set S is nowhere dense iff for every rooted r\u2011ball F there exists an r\u2032\u2011ball F\u2032 with C(F\u2032) \u2286 C(F) \\\\ S. Your Current Output states precisely this criterion for S_P, formulated in root\u2011free terms; good.\\n\\n3) Saturations of cylinders are not open (fix quotient remarks and provide a counterexample).\\n- Let D\u22652 and let F be the 1\u2011ball consisting of a leaf root. C(F) = rooted graphs where the root has degree 1. Its saturation Sat(C(F)) = {(G,\u03c1): G has a leaf somewhere} is not open: pick (H,\u03c3) where the unique leaf of H lies at distance \u226b r from \u03c3. Any neighborhood C(B_r(H,\u03c3)) contains graphs K in which the far leaf is eliminated (modify only outside the r\u2011ball), so K \u2209 Sat(C(F)). Therefore Sat(C(F)) is not open. Consequently, \u03c0(C(F)) need not be open in any unrooted quotient constructed from R via forgetting the root.\\n- Action: keep quotient language only if you define U_q with the final (quotient) topology and refrain from claiming that images of cylinders are open. For the ND result, you do not need \u03c0 to be open.\\n\\n4) Parity/scope corrections for bridges in D\u2011regular graphs.\\n- 1\u2011way infinite bridges cannot exist in D\u2011regular graphs for any D\u22652. Indeed, if e is a bridge with a finite side S, then |\u03b4(S)|=1 and \u2211_{v\u2208S}deg_S(v)=D|S|\u22121 is odd, contradicting the handshake lemma for the finite graph G[S]. Thus the note \u201cin even D\u201d is too weak; strengthen to \u201cfor all D.\u201d\\n- Even D does NOT forbid 2\u2011way infinite bridges (the D\u2011regular infinite tree, D even, has every edge as a 2\u2011way infinite bridge). Adjust statements of Theorems 14\u201316 accordingly.\\n\\n5) Theorem 16 (\u201c2\u2011way infinite bridge is meagre but not nowhere dense, for all D>2\u201d) needs scope fixes and rigorous details.\\n- Scope: The statement can hold in \u0394\u2264D (all D\u22652). In \u0394= D, it also holds for odd and even D, but details differ; at minimum, clarify that the set is empty only if you misstate (it is not empty for even D).\\n- ND decomposition: For each k, the set B_k = {(G,\u03c1): there is a 2\u2011way infinite bridge with midpoint at distance \u2264k from \u03c1} is nowhere dense. Proof idea: From any cylinder C(F), refine to C(F\u2032) by adding a cycle through every edge at distance \u2264k from the root (within the r\u2032\u2011ball), ensuring these edges cannot be bridges in any extension. This construction is explicit and degree\u2011preserving in \u0394\u2264D; in \u0394= D, include degree\u2011saturating gadgets to keep \u0394=D and ensure extendability.\\n- Density: Given any nonempty cylinder, complete it arbitrarily and, far beyond the prescribed ball, splice two disjoint infinite components and connect them by a single edge to create a 2\u2011way infinite bridge. In \u0394\u2264D this is straightforward. In \u0394= D, do a degree\u2011preserving \u201cport\u201d preparation: reserve two boundary vertices with one free stub each, then connect them by a single edge outside the ball; degrees remain D and that edge is a 2\u2011way infinite bridge. Provide full degree bookkeeping and an extension lemma for \u0394= D to make this rigorous.\\n\\n6) Theorem 14 (bridgeless is nowhere dense) needs stronger, explicit gadgets in \u0394= D.\\n- \u0394\u2264D: From any nonempty cylinder, pick a boundary vertex with spare degree and attach a pendant leaf inside the next radius; this forces a 1\u2011way infinite bridge in any extension. Cite the extension lemma (nonemptiness of the refined cylinder) explicitly.\\n- \u0394= D: You cannot create a 1\u2011way infinite bridge; instead, design a finite \u201cport\u201d gadget F\u2032 embedded in the cylinder that saturates all boundary degrees except two designated boundary vertices x,y, each with exactly one free stub, and ensure any completion must connect x and y by exactly one external edge (e.g., by surrounding both with degree\u2011saturating cages). Then that external edge is a 2\u2011way infinite bridge. Provide the gadget and an extension lemma guaranteeing completions exist.\\n\\n7) Theorem 15 (no cut vertex is nowhere dense) still lacks a concrete gadget.\\n- Provide a finite rooted gadget that forces a cut vertex in every extension while preserving \u0394\u2264D or \u0394= D. In \u0394= D even, parity forbids 1\u2011edge cuts, but 1\u2011vertex cuts can exist; give an explicit construction or reference showing one can force a vertex whose removal disconnects the graph (e.g., a central vertex whose neighbors are encapsulated in pairwise disjoint degree\u2011saturated cages).\\n\\n8) Theorem 17 (edge\u2011chromatic number D is nowhere dense) needs concrete class\u20112 finite minors and extension details.\\n- For each D>2, fix a finite graph H with \u0394(H)\u2264D and \u03c7\u2032(H)=D+1 (even D: K_{D+1}; odd D\u22653: explicit class\u20112 regular graphs exist\u2014cite a construction). Embed H within a cylinder and saturate boundary degrees so that any completion contains H as a subgraph; hence \u03c7\u2032\u2265D+1 in every extension. This yields the ND claim.\\n\\n9) Theorem 4 (weak 6\u2011flows): finite satisfiability step unclear.\\n- The augmented finite graphs G_r (adding a sink v_\u221e and wiring boundary edges) need not be bridgeless; Seymour\u2019s theorem applies to bridgeless finite graphs, not necessarily to your augmented multigraph. Either (a) alter the augmentation to ensure the finite constraints used are guaranteed satisfiable (with a correct finite theorem tailor\u2011made for weak flows), or (b) provide a direct combinatorial argument that every finite subset of constraints on G_r is satisfiable. Cite precisely what [7] provides and how it applies to G_r.\\n\\nRigorous, checkable lemmas to add\\n- Lemma (nonemptiness in \u0394\u2264D). If a rooted r\u2011ball F has a boundary vertex of degree < D (at distance r), then C(F) contains an infinite connected extension in \u0394\u2264D. Construct by attaching an infinite tree of degrees \u2264D at that boundary vertex and inductively completing other boundary vertices to maintain connectivity and degrees \u2264D.\\n- Lemma (saturation non\u2011openness). As in item 3), Sat(C(F)) for a leaf root F is not open. This supports your \u201c\u03c0 need not be open\u201d caveat with a concrete example.\\n\\nExamples and sanity checks\\n- D=4 regular tree: typical counterexample to \u201cno 2\u2011way infinite bridges in even D.\u201d Use this to fix the narrative around Theorems 14 and 16.\\n- Saturation vs openness: the \u201chas a leaf somewhere\u201d set is dense and not open; useful to illustrate the pitfalls of quotient arguments.\\n\\nMeagre part: what is still missing and a disciplined plan\\n- A general statement \u201csaturation of a nowhere dense set is meagre\u201d is false without additional structure. You need a re\u2011rooting scheme on a comeagre domain that is definable and degree\u2011preserving.\\n- Proposed route (to be completed):\\n  1) Define partial re\u2011rooting maps T_{p} that move the root along a simple path p starting at the root, wherever p is uniquely determined by local markers.\\n  2) Build degree\u2011preserving marker gadgets ensuring that for comeagre many rooted graphs, a unique marked neighbor (and iteratively, a unique marked path) exists; this yields a comeagre set Good on which finitely many T_{p} cover all finite re\u2011rootings.\\n  3) Show that for nowhere dense N, each T_{p}(N) is nowhere dense (homeomorphism on its domain), hence \u22c3_{p} T_{p}(N) is meagre. If the ambiguity set Amb = R\\\\Good is meagre, the full saturation Sat(N) \u2286 Amb \u222a \u22c3_{p} T_{p}(N) is meagre.\\n  4) The main remaining work: explicit marker gadgets in \u0394\u2264D and \u0394= D (odd/even), and a proof that Amb is meagre.\\n\\nNext steps (concrete and auditable)\\n- Replace the ND proof in the manuscript by the cylinder\u2011avoidance criterion (already in Current Output) and remove the claim about Int(cl(S)). Add the closure\u2011is\u2011saturated proof (short and complete).\\n- Insert the non\u2011openness example for saturations of cylinders to justify the quotient caveat.\\n- Correct the parity/scope statements for bridges and adjust Theorems 14\u201316 accordingly. Add explicit gadgets and extension lemmas for \u0394= D cases.\\n- Clarify the finite satisfiability in Theorem 4 with a precise finite theorem or a modified augmentation.\\n- Develop and document the marker/ambiguity framework for the meagre part, with explicit gadgets and a plan to prove Amb is meagre.\\n\\nSummary of firm, extractable results\\n- Nowhere denseness of S_P is root\u2011invariant: S_P is nowhere dense iff every cylinder admits a subcylinder disjoint from S_P; this criterion is root\u2011free and uses only clopen cylinders.\\n- 1\u2011way infinite bridges do not occur in D\u2011regular graphs for any D\u22652 (handshaking parity on the finite side). Adjust statements accordingly.\\n- Saturations of cylinders are not open; thus naive quotient\u2011openness arguments are invalid here; use the cylinder framework instead.\"}",
