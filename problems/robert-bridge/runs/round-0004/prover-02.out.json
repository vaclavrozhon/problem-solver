  "content": "Ideas\n- Strengthen the meagre\u2011part framework by eliminating the main obstacle: prove that ambiguity sets Amb_k (existence, within distance \u2264k, of two neighbor vertices that are globally rooted\u2011isomorphic) are nowhere dense for all D\u22653. This, together with the re\u2011rooting template covering lemma, yields that the saturation of any nowhere\u2011dense set is meagre.  \n- Provide explicit, degree\u2011respecting \u201cbeacon\u201d attachments that intrinsically distinguish neighbors in \u0394\u2264D and \u0394=D; and a completion (reservoir) lemma ensuring non\u2011emptiness of the refined cylinders in the D\u2011regular space.  \n- Note a sharp exception: D=2 is a counterexample (Amb_1 is comeagre in the double ray), so we restrict to D\u22653.\n\nDefinitions\n- Amb_k\u2282G_{\u2022,D}: (G,\u03c1)\u2208Amb_k if \u2203 w with dist(\u03c1,w)\u2264k and distinct neighbors u\u2260v of w such that (G,u)\u2245(G,v) as rooted graphs.  \n- A k\u2011step template \u0398 is a composition of 1\u2011step re\u2011rooting templates along a path of length k, each uniquely determined on a clopen domain (as in previous rounds).  \n\nReservoir completion for \u0394=D\nLemma R (D\u2011regular completion). Fix D\u22653. Let H be a finite connected graph with max degree \u2264D, and let d_H(x) denote its degree. Suppose there exists at least one vertex z with d_H(z)<D. Then there exists a countably infinite connected D\u2011regular graph G containing H as an induced subgraph.\nProof. Let s=\u2211_{x\u2208V(H)}(D\u2212d_H(x))\u22651 be the number of free \u201cstubs\u201d required at H. Take an infinite D\u2011regular tree T. Remove a matching M of size s from T; let A be the set of 2s endpoints of M in T (each now has degree D\u22121). For each deficit at a vertex x\u2208H, add one new edge from x to a distinct vertex of A. This restores degrees at x (increase by 1) and at the chosen vertex of A (back to D). After consuming s vertices from A, there remain s extra vertices in A; pair them arbitrarily by s disjoint paths within T (re\u2011adding those s edges) to restore D\u2011regularity everywhere. T remains infinite and connected, and the union with H is connected and D\u2011regular. \u220e\n\nNowhere density of ambiguity (D\u22653)\nProposition A. Fix D\u22653 and k\u2208\u2115. Then Amb_k is nowhere dense in G_{\u2022,\u2264D} and in G_{\u2022,=D}.\nProof. Let G_{\u2022}^{F} be a nonempty cylinder; write r for the radius of F and let W={w\u2208V(F): dist_F(root,w)\u2264k}. For each w\u2208W, let N_F(w) denote the set of neighbors of w that lie in F; in \u0394= D, also plan to create the missing neighbors so that in the refined ball we will explicitly realize all D neighbors of w.\nStep 1 (choose disjoint anchor pipes). Choose s\u226br so large that we can, for every ordered pair (w,x) with w\u2208W and x a neighbor of w that we intend to control, reserve a simple path P_{w,x} of length L_{w,x}\u22651 starting with its first edge at x and otherwise vertex\u2011disjoint from F and from all other reserved paths; ensure all L_{w,x} are distinct across the finite family. This choice is made inside the finite refinement we build and enforces disjointness already at the cylinder level.\nStep 2 (preallocate neighbors). For \u0394\u2264D: if x\u2208N_F(w), we anchor P_{w,x} at x; if x is a \u201cfuture neighbor\u201d of w not present in F (i.e., deg_F(w)<D), we first add a new vertex x\u2032 adjacent to w (thus using one unit of the degree budget of w), and anchor P_{w,x\u2032} at x\u2032. For \u0394=D: for each w\u2208W, add exactly D\u2212deg_F(w) new neighbors x\u2032 of w and anchor P_{w,x\u2032} at each; current degrees remain \u2264D.\nStep 3 (attach beacons). Fix a countable family {B_i}_{i\u22651} of pairwise non\u2011isomorphic finite rooted graphs with maximum degree \u2264D; e.g., B_i a simple path of length i rooted at its endpoint (valid for all D\u22652). For each anchored pipe P_{w,x} choose a distinct index i(w,x), and attach B_{i(w,x)} at the far endpoint of P_{w,x} by identifying its root with that endpoint. Because the family over (w,x) is finite, indices can be chosen pairwise distinct.\nLet F\u2032 be the resulting finite refinement (an s\u2032\u2011ball for some s\u2032). By construction, G_{\u2022}^{F\u2032}\u2282G_{\u2022}^{F} and is nonempty in \u0394\u2264D (extend by attaching infinite trees within degree budget). In \u0394=D, nonemptiness follows from Lemma R since at least one vertex on the outer sphere has degree <D in F\u2032 (this can be ensured by leaving some remote boundary vertex unsaturated; we used only finitely many degree budgets around W). Now take any (H,\u03c1)\u2208G_{\u2022}^{F\u2032}. Consider any w\u2208W (identified inside H) and two distinct neighbors u\u2260v of w in H. By construction, exactly one neighbor edge out of u (into its anchored pipe) leads after a unique path length L_{w,u} to a beacon B_{i(w,u)}, and similarly for v with B_{i(w,v)}; moreover, i(w,u)\u2260i(w,v). Hence the rooted graphs (H,u) and (H,v) are not isomorphic (the multiset of anchored beacon types around the root differs). Therefore no such w witnesses membership in Amb_k. Since this holds for every H extending F\u2032, we have G_{\u2022}^{F\u2032}\u2282G_{\u2022}^{F}\u2216Amb_k. Thus Amb_k is nowhere dense. \u220e\nRemark. The argument fails for D=2: in the double ray every vertex has two neighbors with isomorphic rooted types; indeed Amb_1 is the whole space G_{\u2022,=2}. Hence the restriction D\u22653 is tight.\n\nSaturation of nowhere\u2011dense sets is meagre (D\u22653)\nLemma B (re\u2011root covering, recalled). For any nowhere\u2011dense N\u2282G_{\u2022,D} and k\u2208\u2115,\nSat_k(N) \u2286 Amb_k \u222a \u22c3_{\u0398\u2208\ud835\udcaf_k} \u03c4_\u0398(N\u2229Dom(\u0398)),\nwhere \ud835\udcaf_k is the countable set of k\u2011step templates and each \u03c4_\u0398 is a homeomorphism between clopen sets.\nProof. As in the previous round: along any length\u2011k re\u2011rooting path from (G,\u03c1)\u2208N to (G,\u03c3), either at some step the next vertex is not uniquely identifiable among neighbors (placing (G,\u03c1)\u2208Amb_k), or all steps are locally unique and realized by some template \u0398 with \u03c4_\u0398(G,\u03c1)=(G,\u03c3). \u220e\nCorollary C. For D\u22653 and any nowhere\u2011dense N\u2282G_{\u2022,D}, Sat(N)=\u22c3_{k}Sat_k(N) is meagre. Indeed, Amb_k is nowhere dense by Proposition A and \u03c4_\u0398(N) is nowhere dense as the homeomorphic image of a nowhere\u2011dense set. Hence each Sat_k(N) is meagre and a countable union over k is meagre.\n\nConsequences and checks\n- This completes the saturation step promised earlier: for D\u22653, re\u2011rooting a nowhere\u2011dense set yields a meagre set. It applies immediately to properties P whose S_P can be written as a saturation of a union of root\u2011local nowhere\u2011dense witnesses (e.g., \u201chas a 2\u2011way infinite bridge\u201d in Theorem 16). The meagre status for such P is therefore root\u2011invariant.  \n- D=2 caveat: Amb_k need not be small (e.g., in G_{\u2022,=2}, Amb_1=the whole space), so the corollary fails; special treatment is required for D=2.\n\nNext steps\n- Extend the corollary into a full meagre\u2011invariance theorem for all saturated S (D\u22653): Using that \u22c3_k Amb_k is meagre (countable union of nowhere\u2011dense sets), attempt to extract a nowhere\u2011dense transversal N\u2282S with S=Sat(N) by selecting representatives inside S\u2216\u22c3_k Amb_k (comeagre in S). This requires a careful diagonal selection on a countable base of cylinders, ensuring N remains nowhere dense.  \n- Provide explicit, written beacon libraries and degree bookkeeping for even/odd D in \u0394= D (although the above proof uses only max degree \u2264D beacons, a catalogue will be useful in other constructions).  \n- Treat D=2 separately: classify meagre/n.d. saturated sets in the double\u2011ray/ray space and identify which parts of the conjecture can hold there.\n\nSummary\n- Established: For D\u22653 and each k, Amb_k is nowhere dense via intrinsic beacon gadgets anchored beyond a finite radius, both in \u0394\u2264D and \u0394= D (using the reservoir completion).  \n- Hence, for D\u22653, the re\u2011root saturation of any nowhere\u2011dense set is meagre. This advances the meagre half of the conjecture substantially and yields root\u2011invariance for broad classes of unrooted properties expressible via root\u2011local nowhere\u2011dense witnesses.  \n- D=2 is exceptional; a separate analysis is needed there."
