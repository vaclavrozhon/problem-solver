After doing so, more edges could create a cycle around the central edge, compromising its status as a bridge. \n\nIf I position the central bridge far beyond the boundary of the \\(r'\\)-ball, extensions could still add edges outside but risk creating shortcuts that circumvent the bridge's requirement. As long as the central edge is internal, any edges connecting both infinite sides must cross the boundary, meaning I would need to fabricate a route outside that links the two components without compromising their structure.

Sufficiency: attach an infinite \u2264D tree at any boundary stub; B_r unchanged. Necessity: if deg_F(w)=D for all vertices at distance r, then any new neighbor of a vertex at distance <r would lie at distance \u2264r and would change B_r.

Necessity: same distance argument.

Both \\\\mathbf{G}_{\\\\bullet,\u2264D} and \\\\mathbf{G}_{\\\\bullet,=D} are compact in the local topology (standard; see Aldous\u2013Lyons 2007), hence Baire; \u201cnot meagre\u201d follows.

If S\u2286\\\\mathbf{G}_{\\\\bullet,D} is saturated (closed under re\u2011rooting), then \\\\overline{S} and Int(\\\\overline{S}) are saturated.\\nProof. For (G,\u03c1)\u2208\\\\overline{S} and u\u2208V(G), fix t and choose r\u2265t+dist(\u03c1,u) with (H_r,\u03c3_r)\u2208S and B_r(H_r,\u03c3_r)\u2245B_r(G,\u03c1). Transport the root to the image u_r of u; saturation gives (H_r,u_r)\u2208S and B_t(H_r,u_r)\u2245B_t(G,u); thus (G,u)\u2208\\\\overline{S}. The interior is a union of cylinders and hence saturated.\\nCorollary 3.2 (root\u2011invariance of ND). For an unrooted property P, S_P is saturated, and S_P is nowhere dense iff Int(\\\\overline{S_P})=\u2205, which is root\u2011invariant.\\nEquivalent cylinder criterion (preferred for the main text). S_P is nowhere dense iff for every rooted r\u2011ball F there exists an r\u2032\u2011ball F\u2032 extending F with \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^{F\u2032}\u2229S_P=\u2205. This is explicitly root\u2011free and avoids quotient subtleties.\\n\\n3) Theorem 14 (bridgeless nowhere dense): flaws and fixes\\nFlaw (\u2264D case). The sketch \u201cattach a leaf at the boundary\u201d does not force a bridge in every extension: later the extension can create a cycle through the leaf by adding edges to boundary vertices, destroying the bridge.\\nFix (\u2264D). Given any cylinder \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^F, refine to F\u2032 as follows: choose a vertex v at distance \u2264r and build a finite, connected \u201ccore\u201d C containing v; ensure that all vertices of C at distance <R from the root have degree D in F\u2032, and exactly one boundary vertex z (at distance R) lies in C with deg_{F\u2032}(z)=1 (its unique neighbor in C is a vertex w). All other boundary vertices (in or out of C) have degree D in F\u2032. Then any infinite \u2264D extension must attach to C only through z; removing the edge wz disconnects z together with the entire (necessarily infinite) outside from C, so wz is a 1\u2011way infinite bridge in every extension. This yields a subcylinder disjoint from the bridgeless set.\\nFix (=D, odd D). We need exactly one external stub. Let V\u2032 and E\u2032 be the vertex/edge sets of the chosen finite ball F\u2032; the \u201cstub count\u201d S(F\u2032)=\u2211_{x\u2208V\u2032}(D\u2212deg_{F\u2032}(x)) equals D|V\u2032|\u22122|E\u2032| (the number of half\u2011edges leaving F\u2032). For odd D, S(F\u2032)\u2261|V\u2032| (mod 2), so by locally adding edges inside F\u2032 (pairing deficits) we can reduce S(F\u2032) to 1. Arrange that all vertices at distance <R have degree D in F\u2032, and among boundary vertices exactly one z has D\u2212deg_{F\u2032}(z)=1; within F\u2032 make z a leaf of C as above. In any D\u2011regular extension, the unique external edge must attach at z, and the internal edge to its unique neighbor is a 1\u2011way infinite bridge. This completes the odd\u2011regular case. The parity obstruction explains why the even\u2011regular case is excluded here.\\n\\n4) Theorem 15 (no cut vertex is nowhere dense): needs a concrete gadget\\nCurrent sketch is too vague. A workable gadget (both \u2264D and even =D): Build F\u2032 with a vertex v and two internally saturated lobes L_1 and L_2 such that:\\n- All vertices of L_2 at the boundary are degree\u2011D within F\u2032; thus no extension can attach to L_2 except via v.\\n- L_1 contains all boundary deficits that allow infinite continuation; thus every path from the outside to L_2 must pass through v.\\n- Ensure there is no internal v\u2011avoiding path between L_1 and L_2 in F\u2032.\\nThen v is a cut vertex in every extension. Please add explicit degree counts to show feasibility under both constraints (\u2264D and =D, even D).\\n\\n5) Theorem 16 (2\u2011way infinite bridge: meagre but not nowhere dense)\\n- Meagre: Define P_k = \u201cthere exists a 2\u2011way infinite bridge at distance \u2264k from the root.\u201d For any cylinder \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^F, we can refine to F\u2032 in which every edge at distance \u2264k lies on a cycle formed as follows: push to a larger radius R\u226br, choose two boundary vertices with slack (guaranteed by Lemma 2.1/2.2) reachable from the two endpoints by disjoint interior paths avoiding the edge, and add an external path between these boundary vertices in F\u2032. This uses only boundary slack and does not alter B_r. Thus every extension has no bridges within distance \u2264k. Hence each P_k is nowhere dense and \u22c3_k P_k is meagre.\\nCaveat and fix: One must handle the case where some endpoint already has degree D in F. In \u2264D, pick the interior path from the endpoint along existing edges; extra degree is only used at boundary vertices we control. In =D, ensure via the choice of F\u2032 (extending F) that the connecting interior paths terminate at boundary vertices with D\u2212deg_{F\u2032}>0; this is always possible in nonempty cylinders by Lemma 2.2. This needs to be written carefully.\\n- Not nowhere dense (density). For every cylinder \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^F choose two boundary vertices b_1,b_2 with deficits (exists by Lemma 2.1/2.2) and extend outside to two disjoint infinite trees T_1, T_2. Connect T_1 and T_2 by a single edge e outside the original ball. The resulting extension contains a 2\u2011way infinite bridge (e). Hence the property is dense. Conclude: meagre but not nowhere dense.\\n\\n6) Theorem 17 (edge\u2011chromatic number): fix the parity error\\nFlaw. \u201cRemoving an edge preserves \u03c7\u2032=D+1 by parity\u201d is false (e.g., K_3\u2212e has \u03c7\u2032=2).\\nFix. For each D\u22653, let H be a finite D\u2011regular class\u20112 simple graph (even D: K_{D+1}; odd D: snarks for D=3 and known class\u20112 D\u2011regular families for higher odd D; cite Tashkinov/Kierstead results or a standard existence theorem). Given any cylinder, refine to a subcylinder whose r\u2032\u2011ball contains H strictly inside and degree budgets are met. Any extension then has \u03c7\u2032\u2265\u03c7\u2032(H)=D+1, so the class\u20111 set {\u03c7\u2032=D} is nowhere dense. Please replace the parity sentence by this forcing\u2011subgraph argument and add references.\\n\\n7) Quotient by forgetting the root: caveat\\nDo not rely on \u03c0 being open. For a rooted cylinder C, its saturation \u03c0^{-1}(\u03c0(C)) is typically F_\u03c3, not open. Meagreness is not directly preserved under \u03c0; base all arguments in the rooted space using saturated sets and cylinder refinements.\\n\\n8) Local re\u2011rooting homeomorphisms (toward meagre root\u2011invariance)\\nLemma 8.1 (marker\u2011based local re\u2011rooting). Given an r\u2011ball F and a vertex u in F, there exists an extension F_mark (radius r\u2032\u2265r) and cylinders U=\\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^{F_\\\\mathrm{mark}}, V=\\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^{F_\\\\mathrm{mark}[u]} such that re\u2011rooting at the (uniquely) marked copy of u defines a homeomorphism U\u2192V.\\nSketch. Extend along a chosen geodesic from the root to u and attach at a boundary vertex on this path a small rigid \u201cbeacon\u201d tree whose isomorphism type is unique within the r\u2032\u2011ball, thereby canonically identifying u (by a fixed offset from the beacon). Degree constraints: in \u2264D use a boundary deficit; in =D first engineer a unique boundary deficit (odd D by parity pairing) to host the beacon. This gives local, root\u2011preserving homeomorphisms that can be iterated.\\nRemark. Meagreness is preserved under homeomorphism. If a saturated set S is nonmeagre on U, then its re\u2011rooted image is nonmeagre on V. A complete proof of meagre root\u2011invariance will follow if we cover a comeagre set by countably many such domains implementing all finite re\u2011rootings; this reduces to constructing a comeagre \u201cmarker\u2011ready\u201d domain (technical but plausible).\\n\\n9) Examples\\n- Counterexample to \u201cattach a leaf\u201d forcing. Start with any cylinder; append a leaf z at distance r+1. In an extension, add an outside path that connects z to a neighbor of its parent, creating a cycle through the leaf edge. The edge ceases to be a bridge. Hence degree\u2011saturation as in Section 3 is necessary.\\n- D=2 sanity check. Even regularity forbids a single external stub (parity), matching the exclusion of even D in Theorem 14(ii).\\n\\n10) Next steps (actionable)\\n- Fix Section 2: incorporate the corrected neighborhood equivalence, clopen cylinders, and the nonemptiness criteria (with proofs).\\n- Replace Theorem 14\u2019s leaf argument with the \u201cunique external port via a leaf inside the core\u201d construction; write the parity pairing proof for odd D in the regular case.\\n- Provide a precise cut\u2011vertex gadget for Theorem 15 with full degree bookkeeping in both \u2264D and =D (even).\\n- For Theorem 16, expand both parts: (i) P_k nowhere dense with the boundary\u2011slack construction; (ii) density via explicit dumbbell extension. Address saturation pitfalls explicitly.\\n- For Theorem 17, delete the parity sentence and use forcing by embedding a finite class\u20112 D\u2011regular H; add references for existence of H in odd D.\\n- Develop the marker gadgets for Lemma 8.1 uniformly in \u2264D and =D, and prove that the domains of these partial re\u2011rootings cover a comeagre set; this will materially advance the meagre root\u2011invariance half of the conjecture.\\n\"}",
