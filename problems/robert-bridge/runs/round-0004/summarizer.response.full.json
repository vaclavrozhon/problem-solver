          "text": "{\"summary_md\":\"Last round settled the nowhere\u2011density half of the conjecture: for any unrooted property P the set S_P is saturated, and we proved that for any saturated S the closure cl(S) and interior Int(cl(S)) are saturated. Equivalently, we gave a root\u2011free cylinder criterion: S_P is nowhere dense iff every rooted r\u2011ball F admits an extension F' whose cylinder is disjoint from S_P. Hence nowhere\u2011density of S_P does not depend on the root. The meagre half remains open; it was reduced to showing that saturations of nowhere\u2011dense sets are meagre by covering Sat_k(N) with countably many homeomorphic images of N plus ambiguity sets Amb_k, and proving each Amb_k is meagre via degree\u2011preserving marker gadgets. A concrete boundary\u2011hub/beacon scheme (\u0394\u2264D vs \u0394=D, parity/regularity issues, and a D=2 special case) was sketched; remaining work is formalizing indices/depths, degree bookkeeping, and completion lemmas. Note: the forget\u2011the\u2011root quotient need not be open, so quotient arguments for meagreness fail.
