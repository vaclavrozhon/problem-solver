Last round settled the nowhere‑density half of the conjecture: for any unrooted property P the set S_P is saturated, and we proved that for any saturated S the closure cl(S) and interior Int(cl(S)) are saturated. Equivalently, we gave a root‑free cylinder criterion: S_P is nowhere dense iff every rooted r‑ball F admits an extension F' whose cylinder is disjoint from S_P. Hence nowhere‑density of S_P does not depend on the root. The meagre half remains open; it was reduced to showing that saturations of nowhere‑dense sets are meagre by covering Sat_k(N) with countably many homeomorphic images of N plus ambiguity sets Amb_k, and proving each Amb_k is meagre via degree‑preserving marker gadgets. A concrete boundary‑hub/beacon scheme (Δ≤D vs Δ=D, parity/regularity issues, and a D=2 special case) was sketched; remaining work is formalizing indices/depths, degree bookkeeping, and completion lemmas. Note: the forget‑the‑root quotient need not be open, so quotient arguments for meagreness fail. Citations: Current Proofs; papers/paper1.txt
