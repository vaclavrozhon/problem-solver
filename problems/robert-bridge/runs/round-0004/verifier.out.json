  "feedback_md": "Main status: The nowhere-dense (ND) half is correct as stated in Current Output via the cylinder criterion; it avoids quotient subtleties and does not need Int(cl(S)) to be saturated. The meagre half has nontrivial remaining work; Prover 2\u2019s new Amb_k strategy is promising but needs significant repairs to respect the cylinder constraints and degree budgets.\n\nProver 1\n- The quotient approach still relies on an invalid step: images of cylinders under the forget-the-root map \u03c0 need not be open; saturations of cylinders are typically F_sigma, not open. Your ND/meagre equivalences through U_q therefore lack justification. Provide a concrete non-openness example (e.g., the saturation of the \u201croot has degree 1\u201d cylinder) and avoid quotient-based openness in arguments.\n\nProver 2\n- Positive: A clear reduction of Sat_k(N) to countably many homeomorphic images of N plus Amb_k, and a concrete plan to make Amb_k small. However, the current beacon proof for \u201cAmb_k is nowhere dense\u201d starts new pipes with the first edge at interior vertices x, which would alter the given r-ball F and is invalid for refining cylinders.\n- Fix: Use only attachments at or beyond the outer sphere of the given cylinder. From a nonempty cylinder, pick one boundary vertex with spare degree (guaranteed) and attach a large finite hub there. For each controlled pair (w, x) with dist(\u03c1,w)\u2264k and x\u2208N(w), route along an existing path inside F from x to that boundary vertex and then through disjoint branches in the hub to distinct beacons B_i at pairwise distinct depths. Choose beacon types/lengths so the multiset of signatures seen at u differs from that at v, breaking (G,u)\u2245(G,v). This respects B_r and degree budgets in \u0394\u2264D. For \u0394=D, first ensure F\u2032 saturates all vertices at distance <R to degree D, leaving at least one boundary stub at distance R; only add edges at the boundary while building the hub. Provide full degree bookkeeping and a completion lemma (edges added only from the outer sphere) to keep B_R fixed.\n- D=2 remains exceptional as noted.\n\nProver 3\n- Good metric corrections and a valid proof that closures of saturated sets are saturated. Do not rely on \u201cInt(cl(S)) is saturated\u201d; it is unnecessary. Your gadget guidance for Theorems 14\u201317 is useful, but the \u2264D \u201cattach a leaf\u201d forcing is insufficient (later extensions can create cycles through the leaf). Replace by a port/hub construction that forces exactly one external connection (for bridges) or forces cut vertices as specified, with explicit parity/degree checks.\n\nConcrete next steps\n- P2: Write the full hub-at-the-boundary proof that Amb_k is nowhere dense for D\u22653 in both \u0394\u2264D and \u0394=D, including (i) keeping B_r intact, (ii) degree feasibility, (iii) interior saturation for \u0394=D, and (iv) a completion lemma that only uses outer-sphere attachments. Then derive \u201csaturation of nowhere dense \u21d2 meagre\u201d rigorously for D\u22653.\n- P3: Supply complete gadgets and proofs for Theorems 14\u201317 with explicit degree bookkeeping; correct the parity statements (no 1-way bridges in any D-regular graph; 2-way bridges possible for even D).\n- P1: Remove quotient-openness claims; if quotient is used, work only with saturated opens or provide a selector on a comeagre domain.\n- All: Fix Theorem 4\u2019s finite satisfiability step with an applicable finite result or a modified augmentation that guarantees consistency.",

    "content": "Meagre part: boundary-hub beacon scheme (D\u22653)\n- Goal: Show Amb_k (exists w within distance \u2264k with two neighbors u\u2260v s.t. (G,u)\u2245(G,v)) is nowhere dense. This, with the re-rooting template covering, implies: saturation of a nowhere-dense set is meagre.\n- Constraint: Refining a cylinder C(F) must preserve B_r(F). Hence no new edges may be added at vertices with dist<r from the root. All modifications must occur at the outer sphere (dist=r) or beyond.\n- Plan (\u0394\u2264D): Given nonempty C(F), pick a boundary vertex b with deg_F(b)<D. Attach a finite hub H beyond b using only one additional edge at b. For each controlled pair (w,x) with dist(root,w)\u2264k and x\u2208N_F(w): choose an existing path inside F from x to b (no new edges inside B_r), and reserve a distinct branch in H ending at a beacon B_i (pairwise non-isomorphic) at a chosen depth L(w,x). Choose indices/depths so that for any neighbors u,v of w, the multisets of (beacon type, distance from root at u) and at v differ; then (G,u)\u2247(G,v) in any completion. Degree budgets are respected since only b gains one new incident edge; all other attachments occur in the newly added hub.\n- Plan (\u0394=D): First choose a larger radius R\u226br and build F\u2032 so that every vertex at dist< R has degree D within F\u2032, and at least one vertex on the outer sphere dist=R has spare capacity (leave one stub). Attach the hub at that outer sphere vertex and proceed as above. Only outer sphere vertices get new edges; hence any D-regular completion that preserves B_R=F\u2032 exists (attach the remaining stubs outside), and Amb_k is avoided within C(F\u2032).\n- Tasks: (i) Formalize the choice of indices/depths to guarantee distinct neighbor-root signature multisets at u vs v; (ii) Write explicit degree bookkeeping and a completion lemma for \u0394=D ensuring B_R remains fixed; (iii) Treat D=2 separately (Amb_1 is large; the above fails).\n\nCorrections and caveats\n- ND root-invariance: use the cylinder criterion (root-free) only; Int(cl(S)) saturation is unnecessary. \n- Quotients: Saturations of cylinders are typically not open; avoid quotient-openness arguments.\n- Bridges/cuts: Replace naive \u2018attach a leaf\u2019 forcing by port/hub gadgets that ensure unique external connections in all completions; check parity (no 1-way bridges in any D-regular graph)."
