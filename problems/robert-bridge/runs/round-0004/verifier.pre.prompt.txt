=== SYSTEM ===
You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md, proofs.md, and output.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers
- notes.md (informal progress & exploratory work so far)
- proofs.md (rigorous proofs & detailed mathematics so far)
- output.md (main results found so far)

**Three-tier file system guidelines**:
- **notes.md**: Readable, log of exploratory work, intuitions, failed attempts, ideas. Prefer appending. Replace only if old notes are clearly misleading. It should be self-contained: In particular, reading it should make sense without knowing the output of provers in past rounds. 

- **proofs.md**: Complete rigorous mathematical proofs with full details. Think twice before adding anything. Contains proven lemmas, theorems, and detailed derivations. Only add mathematically verified content here.
- **output.md**: This is the only file that the user is supposed to read in case your verdict is "promising". It has to be self-contained. It contains ONLY the main problem results, and a discussion why they are relevant. It is extremely selective. Think twice before promoting proofs from proofs.md to output.md. Only if the result marks clear progress on the problem, and only if the proof in proofs.md has been thoroughly vetted by provers and you, it can join output.md. Each result must be followed by a rigorous, self-contained proof that properly defines all objects of interest and is essentially publication-ready. 

Tasks:
1) Audit rigor: identify unjustified steps, false statements, missing lemmas; produce minimal counterexamples.
2) Triage value: separate genuine progress from noise.
3) Guide next steps: propose what provers should try next.

## Setting

- Fix an integer \(D \ge 2\).
- Let \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) be the space of **countably infinite, connected, rooted graphs** \((G,\rho)\).
- For \((G,\rho) \in \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) and \(r \in \mathbb{N}\), let \(B_r(G,\rho)\) denote the rooted (closed) ball of radius \(r\) about \(\rho\).
- Equip \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) with the **local (Benjamini–Schramm) metric** \(d_\bullet\) given by
  \[
  d_\bullet\big((G,\rho),(H,\sigma)\big)=2^{-R},
  \qquad
  R=\sup\{r\in\mathbb{N} : B_r(G,\rho)\cong B_r(H,\sigma)\}.
  \]
  (Equivalently, \(d_\bullet((G,\rho),(H,\sigma))<2^{-r}\) iff \(B_r(G,\rho)\cong B_r(H,\sigma)\).)
- Degree‑constrained subspaces:
  - \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\): all rooted graphs with \(\Delta(G)\le D\).
  - \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,= D}\): all rooted graphs with \(\Delta(G)= D\).
  We write \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for either of these when the distinction is unimportant.
- A subset \(S\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) is **nowhere dense** if the interior of \(\overline{S}\) is empty. A set is **meagre** (first category) if it is a countable union of nowhere dense sets; its complement is **comeagre**. A property is called **typical** if the corresponding set is comeagre.
- An edge \(e\) of an (unrooted) graph \(G\) is a **bridge** if \(G-e\) has more connected components than \(G\). A bridge is **2‑way infinite** if both components are infinite and **1‑way infinite** otherwise.

# Research Notes



Conjecture (Root‑invariance of smallness). For an unrooted property P and S_P={ (G,\rho) in G_{\bullet,D} : G has P }, does the nowhere‑dense/meagre status of S_P depend on root choices?

Agreed notions
- Saturated sets: S is saturated if (G,\rho) in S implies (G,u) in S for every vertex u of G. For unrooted P, S_P is saturated.
- Cylinders form a clopen base in the local topology, hence nowhere density can be witnessed by refining cylinders.

Key lemma (settled). If S is saturated, then cl(S) and Int(cl(S)) are saturated. Sketch: For (G,\rho) in cl(S) and u in V(G), for each t pick r≫dist(\rho,u)+t and (H_r,\sigma_r) in S with B_r matching at the root; transport the root to the image of u and use saturation to see (H_r,u_r) in S with B_t(H_r,u_r)≅B_t(G,u). Thus (G,u) in cl(S). Interior of a saturated set is saturated because open sets are unions of cylinders and re‑rooting preserves membership.

Consequence (nowhere density is root‑invariant). S is nowhere dense iff Int(cl(S))=\emptyset. For saturated S this condition is root‑free; applied to S_P it proves the ND half of the conjecture.

Caveat on quotients. Let π: G_{\bullet,D}→U_q be the quotient by forgetting the root. In general, π maps open cylinders to sets whose preimages are the saturations of those cylinders, which need not be open; π(C) need not be open. Thus arguments that rely on π being open are invalid. Any quotient‑based comparison must work with saturated open sets only, or with a selector on a comeagre domain.

Meagre part: current route and plan. Define Good_∞ (comeagre local rigidity): around the root and finitely many steps, distinct neighbors are eventually distinguishable. Using (degree‑preserving) markers, each Bad_{m,\ell} should be nowhere dense; this yields a comeagre domain on which countably many partial re‑rooting homeomorphisms generate all finite re‑rootings. Then: the saturation of a nowhere‑dense set is meagre (countable union of homeomorphic images of a nowhere‑dense set plus a meagre exceptional set). This would imply meagreness for many S_P constructed as saturations of root‑local nowhere‑dense witnesses. Completing this requires explicit marker gadgets in both Δ≤D and Δ= D (odd/even cases).

Open items
- Finish the Good_∞ construction with uniform markers in Δ= D and write the proof that each Bad_{m,\ell} is nowhere dense.
- Either produce a Borel/continuous selector on a comeagre domain (unique marked root) to compare meagreness between U_q and the rooted space, or construct a counterexample showing full meagre equivalence can fail without extra structure.
- Optional: record the metric off‑by‑one correction and the safe non‑emptiness criterion for cylinders (≤D is straightforward).

Clarification: Nowhere-density root-invariance does not require that Int(cl(S)) be saturated. For an unrooted property P, S_P is saturated and the cylinder criterion yields a root-free formulation: S_P is nowhere dense iff for every rooted r-ball F there is an extension F′ such that every D-bounded connected graph containing a copy of F′ (at some vertex) fails P. This avoids any subtlety about interiors of closures.

Caveat on quotients: The forget-the-root quotient map π need not send cylinders to open sets in the quotient of the rooted topology; saturations of cylinders are typically not open. Thus arguments that rely on π being open (or category-preserving) are invalid. Work directly with the rooted clopen cylinder basis.

Meagre part plan update: Replace the previous “Bad_{m,ℓ} is nowhere dense” approach (false in general) by the Amb_k reduction: for nowhere-dense N, Sat_k(N) is covered by countably many homeomorphic images of N plus the ambiguity set Amb_k (points where some step of re-rooting is not uniquely determined). If we can show each Amb_k is meagre via intrinsic markers (degree-preserving gadgets in ≤D and =D), then Sat(N) is meagre. Action items: design explicit port/marker gadgets and prove the Amb_k meagreness. Also, fix parity/scope issues for regular even D (no bridges) in related theorems.

# Main Results

Theorem (Root-invariance of nowhere density). Fix D≥2. Let P be any property of unrooted graphs and let S_P={ (G,\rho) in G_{\bullet,D} : G has P }. Then S_P is nowhere dense in (G_{\bullet,D},d_\bullet) if and only if the following equivalent, root-free condition holds:
For every rooted r-ball F there exists an extension r′-ball F′ with G_{\bullet}^{F′}⊆G_{\bullet}^{F} such that for every D-bounded connected graph H and vertex v with B_{r′}(H,v)≅F′, the unrooted graph H does not have P.
In particular, whether S_P is nowhere dense does not depend on how graphs are rooted.

Proof. Cylinders G_{\bullet}^{F} form a clopen base of the local topology. If S_P is nowhere dense, then for each r-ball F there exists a subcylinder G_{\bullet}^{F′}⊆G_{\bullet}^{F} with G_{\bullet}^{F′}∩S_P=\emptyset. Hence any (H,v) whose r′-ball equals F′ lies outside S_P, so H fails P. Conversely, if such F′ exists for each F, then every nonempty cylinder contains a subcylinder disjoint from S_P, which is equivalent to S_P being nowhere dense. This criterion refers only to P and D, not to a chosen root, establishing root-invariance. ∎

Note. The meagre part of the conjecture remains open in full generality. A promising route proceeds via covering the re-root saturations of nowhere-dense sets by countably many homeomorphic images plus a small ambiguity set; proving that the ambiguity set is meagre (via degree-preserving marker gadgets) would settle meagre root-invariance for broad classes of properties.

Ideas and high‑level assessment
- The nowhere‑dense half of the conjecture is essentially settled correctly in the Current Output via a clean cylinder‑avoidance criterion that is root‑free for saturated sets S_P. Keep that and remove reliance on Int(cl(S)).
- Several claims in Notes remain problematic: (i) “Int(cl(S)) is saturated” is unproven and likely false in general; it is also unnecessary. (ii) Quotient‑map comments are partially right, but the justification needs a concrete counterexample showing that the saturation of a cylinder need not be open. (iii) There are parity/scope errors in statements about bridges in D‑regular graphs. (iv) The meagre plan still lacks concrete, verifiable gadgets and a precise ambiguity‑set analysis.

Specific gaps, errors, and corrective lemmas
1) On “Int(cl(S)) is saturated.”
- The given sketch is invalid: re‑rooting does not preserve membership in a cylinder, and open sets are unions of cylinders. Hence, from (G,ρ) ∈ Int(cl(S)) it does not follow that (G,u) ∈ Int(cl(S)). You do not need this statement for the ND result. Remove it; keep only “cl(S) is saturated,” which is true and used below.
- What you can safely use: closure of a saturated set is saturated.
  Proof. If S is saturated and (G,ρ) ∈ cl(S), then for any vertex u and radius t there exists r≫dist(ρ,u)+t and (H_r,σ_r) ∈ S with B_r(H_r,σ_r) ≅ B_r(G,ρ). Let u_r be the image of u; saturation gives (H_r,u_r) ∈ S and B_t(H_r,u_r) ≅ B_t(G,u), so (G,u) ∈ cl(S).

2) Cylinder characterization of nowhere denseness (use this everywhere).
- Cylinders C(F):=G_{•}^{F} are clopen in the rooted ultrametric space. A set S is nowhere dense iff for every rooted r‑ball F there exists an r′‑ball F′ with C(F′) ⊆ C(F) \ S. Your Current Output states precisely this criterion for S_P, formulated in root‑free terms; good.

3) Saturations of cylinders are not open (fix quotient remarks and provide a counterexample).
- Let D≥2 and let F be the 1‑ball consisting of a leaf root. C(F) = rooted graphs where the root has degree 1. Its saturation Sat(C(F)) = {(G,ρ): G has a leaf somewhere} is not open: pick (H,σ) where the unique leaf of H lies at distance ≫ r from σ. Any neighborhood C(B_r(H,σ)) contains graphs K in which the far leaf is eliminated (modify only outside the r‑ball), so K ∉ Sat(C(F)). Therefore Sat(C(F)) is not open. Consequently, π(C(F)) need not be open in any unrooted quotient constructed from R via forgetting the root.
- Action: keep quotient language only if you define U_q with the final (quotient) topology and refrain from claiming that images of cylinders are open. For the ND result, you do not need π to be open.

4) Parity/scope corrections for bridges in D‑regular graphs.
- 1‑way infinite bridges cannot exist in D‑regular graphs for any D≥2. Indeed, if e is a bridge with a finite side S, then |δ(S)|=1 and ∑_{v∈S}deg_S(v)=D|S|−1 is odd, contradicting the handshake lemma for the finite graph G[S]. Thus the note “in even D” is too weak; strengthen to “for all D.”
- Even D does NOT forbid 2‑way infinite bridges (the D‑regular infinite tree, D even, has every edge as a 2‑way infinite bridge). Adjust statements of Theorems 14–16 accordingly.

5) Theorem 16 (“2‑way infinite bridge is meagre but not nowhere dense, for all D>2”) needs scope fixes and rigorous details.
- Scope: The statement can hold in Δ≤D (all D≥2). In Δ= D, it also holds for odd and even D, but details differ; at minimum, clarify that the set is empty only if you misstate (it is not empty for even D).
- ND decomposition: For each k, the set B_k = {(G,ρ): there is a 2‑way infinite bridge with midpoint at distance ≤k from ρ} is nowhere dense. Proof idea: From any cylinder C(F), refine to C(F′) by adding a cycle through every edge at distance ≤k from the root (within the r′‑ball), ensuring these edges cannot be bridges in any extension. This construction is explicit and degree‑preserving in Δ≤D; in Δ= D, include degree‑saturating gadgets to keep Δ=D and ensure extendability.
- Density: Given any nonempty cylinder, complete it arbitrarily and, far beyond the prescribed ball, splice two disjoint infinite components and connect them by a single edge to create a 2‑way infinite bridge. In Δ≤D this is straightforward. In Δ= D, do a degree‑preserving “port” preparation: reserve two boundary vertices with one free stub each, then connect them by a single edge outside the ball; degrees remain D and that edge is a 2‑way infinite bridge. Provide full degree bookkeeping and an extension lemma for Δ= D to make this rigorous.

6) Theorem 14 (bridgeless is nowhere dense) needs stronger, explicit gadgets in Δ= D.
- Δ≤D: From any nonempty cylinder, pick a boundary vertex with spare degree and attach a pendant leaf inside the next radius; this forces a 1‑way infinite bridge in any extension. Cite the extension lemma (nonemptiness of the refined cylinder) explicitly.
- Δ= D: You cannot create a 1‑way infinite bridge; instead, design a finite “port” gadget F′ embedded in the cylinder that saturates all boundary degrees except two designated boundary vertices x,y, each with exactly one free stub, and ensure any completion must connect x and y by exactly one external edge (e.g., by surrounding both with degree‑saturating cages). Then that external edge is a 2‑way infinite bridge. Provide the gadget and an extension lemma guaranteeing completions exist.

7) Theorem 15 (no cut vertex is nowhere dense) still lacks a concrete gadget.
- Provide a finite rooted gadget that forces a cut vertex in every extension while preserving Δ≤D or Δ= D. In Δ= D even, parity forbids 1‑edge cuts, but 1‑vertex cuts can exist; give an explicit construction or reference showing one can force a vertex whose removal disconnects the graph (e.g., a central vertex whose neighbors are encapsulated in pairwise disjoint degree‑saturated cages).

8) Theorem 17 (edge‑chromatic number D is nowhere dense) needs concrete class‑2 finite minors and extension details.
- For each D>2, fix a finite graph H with Δ(H)≤D and χ′(H)=D+1 (even D: K_{D+1}; odd D≥3: explicit class‑2 regular graphs exist—cite a construction). Embed H within a cylinder and saturate boundary degrees so that any completion contains H as a subgraph; hence χ′≥D+1 in every extension. This yields the ND claim.

9) Theorem 4 (weak 6‑flows): finite satisfiability step unclear.
- The augmented finite graphs G_r (adding a sink v_∞ and wiring boundary edges) need not be bridgeless; Seymour’s theorem applies to bridgeless finite graphs, not necessarily to your augmented multigraph. Either (a) alter the augmentation to ensure the finite constraints used are guaranteed satisfiable (with a correct finite theorem tailor‑made for weak flows), or (b) provide a direct combinatorial argument that every finite subset of constraints on G_r is satisfiable. Cite precisely what [7] provides and how it applies to G_r.

Rigorous, checkable lemmas to add
- Lemma (nonemptiness in Δ≤D). If a rooted r‑ball F has a boundary vertex of degree < D (at distance r), then C(F) contains an infinite connected extension in Δ≤D. Construct by attaching an infinite tree of degrees ≤D at that boundary vertex and inductively completing other boundary vertices to maintain connectivity and degrees ≤D.
- Lemma (saturation non‑openness). As in item 3), Sat(C(F)) for a leaf root F is not open. This supports your “π need not be open” caveat with a concrete example.

Examples and sanity checks
- D=4 regular tree: typical counterexample to “no 2‑way infinite bridges in even D.” Use this to fix the narrative around Theorems 14 and 16.
- Saturation vs openness: the “has a leaf somewhere” set is dense and not open; useful to illustrate the pitfalls of quotient arguments.

Meagre part: what is still missing and a disciplined plan
- A general statement “saturation of a nowhere dense set is meagre” is false without additional structure. You need a re‑rooting scheme on a comeagre domain that is definable and degree‑preserving.
- Proposed route (to be completed):
  1) Define partial re‑rooting maps T_{p} that move the root along a simple path p starting at the root, wherever p is uniquely determined by local markers.
  2) Build degree‑preserving marker gadgets ensuring that for comeagre many rooted graphs, a unique marked neighbor (and iteratively, a unique marked path) exists; this yields a comeagre set Good on which finitely many T_{p} cover all finite re‑rootings.
  3) Show that for nowhere dense N, each T_{p}(N) is nowhere dense (homeomorphism on its domain), hence ⋃_{p} T_{p}(N) is meagre. If the ambiguity set Amb = R\Good is meagre, the full saturation Sat(N) ⊆ Amb ∪ ⋃_{p} T_{p}(N) is meagre.
  4) The main remaining work: explicit marker gadgets in Δ≤D and Δ= D (odd/even), and a proof that Amb is meagre.

Next steps (concrete and auditable)
- Replace the ND proof in the manuscript by the cylinder‑avoidance criterion (already in Current Output) and remove the claim about Int(cl(S)). Add the closure‑is‑saturated proof (short and complete).
- Insert the non‑openness example for saturations of cylinders to justify the quotient caveat.
- Correct the parity/scope statements for bridges and adjust Theorems 14–16 accordingly. Add explicit gadgets and extension lemmas for Δ= D cases.
- Clarify the finite satisfiability in Theorem 4 with a precise finite theorem or a modified augmentation.
- Develop and document the marker/ambiguity framework for the meagre part, with explicit gadgets and a plan to prove Amb is meagre.

Summary of firm, extractable results
- Nowhere denseness of S_P is root‑invariant: S_P is nowhere dense iff every cylinder admits a subcylinder disjoint from S_P; this criterion is root‑free and uses only clopen cylinders.
- 1‑way infinite bridges do not occur in D‑regular graphs for any D≥2 (handshaking parity on the finite side). Adjust statements accordingly.
- Saturations of cylinders are not open; thus naive quotient‑openness arguments are invalid here; use the cylinder framework instead.


=== Prover 2 Output ===

Ideas
- Strengthen the meagre‑part framework by eliminating the main obstacle: prove that ambiguity sets Amb_k (existence, within distance ≤k, of two neighbor vertices that are globally rooted‑isomorphic) are nowhere dense for all D≥3. This, together with the re‑rooting template covering lemma, yields that the saturation of any nowhere‑dense set is meagre.  
- Provide explicit, degree‑respecting “beacon” attachments that intrinsically distinguish neighbors in Δ≤D and Δ=D; and a completion (reservoir) lemma ensuring non‑emptiness of the refined cylinders in the D‑regular space.  
- Note a sharp exception: D=2 is a counterexample (Amb_1 is comeagre in the double ray), so we restrict to D≥3.

Definitions
- Amb_k⊂G_{•,D}: (G,ρ)∈Amb_k if ∃ w with dist(ρ,w)≤k and distinct neighbors u≠v of w such that (G,u)≅(G,v) as rooted graphs.  
- A k‑step template Θ is a composition of 1‑step re‑rooting templates along a path of length k, each uniquely determined on a clopen domain (as in previous rounds).  

Reservoir completion for Δ=D
Lemma R (D‑regular completion). Fix D≥3. Let H be a finite connected graph with max degree ≤D, and let d_H(x) denote its degree. Suppose there exists at least one vertex z with d_H(z)<D. Then there exists a countably infinite connected D‑regular graph G containing H as an induced subgraph.
Proof. Let s=∑_{x∈V(H)}(D−d_H(x))≥1 be the number of free “stubs” required at H. Take an infinite D‑regular tree T. Remove a matching M of size s from T; let A be the set of 2s endpoints of M in T (each now has degree D−1). For each deficit at a vertex x∈H, add one new edge from x to a distinct vertex of A. This restores degrees at x (increase by 1) and at the chosen vertex of A (back to D). After consuming s vertices from A, there remain s extra vertices in A; pair them arbitrarily by s disjoint paths within T (re‑adding those s edges) to restore D‑regularity everywhere. T remains infinite and connected, and the union with H is connected and D‑regular. ∎

Nowhere density of ambiguity (D≥3)
Proposition A. Fix D≥3 and k∈ℕ. Then Amb_k is nowhere dense in G_{•,≤D} and in G_{•,=D}.
Proof. Let G_{•}^{F} be a nonempty cylinder; write r for the radius of F and let W={w∈V(F): dist_F(root,w)≤k}. For each w∈W, let N_F(w) denote the set of neighbors of w that lie in F; in Δ= D, also plan to create the missing neighbors so that in the refined ball we will explicitly realize all D neighbors of w.
Step 1 (choose disjoint anchor pipes). Choose s≫r so large that we can, for every ordered pair (w,x) with w∈W and x a neighbor of w that we intend to control, reserve a simple path P_{w,x} of length L_{w,x}≥1 starting with its first edge at x and otherwise vertex‑disjoint from F and from all other reserved paths; ensure all L_{w,x} are distinct across the finite family. This choice is made inside the finite refinement we build and enforces disjointness already at the cylinder level.
Step 2 (preallocate neighbors). For Δ≤D: if x∈N_F(w), we anchor P_{w,x} at x; if x is a “future neighbor” of w not present in F (i.e., deg_F(w)<D), we first add a new vertex x′ adjacent to w (thus using one unit of the degree budget of w), and anchor P_{w,x′} at x′. For Δ=D: for each w∈W, add exactly D−deg_F(w) new neighbors x′ of w and anchor P_{w,x′} at each; current degrees remain ≤D.
Step 3 (attach beacons). Fix a countable family {B_i}_{i≥1} of pairwise non‑isomorphic finite rooted graphs with maximum degree ≤D; e.g., B_i a simple path of length i rooted at its endpoint (valid for all D≥2). For each anchored pipe P_{w,x} choose a distinct index i(w,x), and attach B_{i(w,x)} at the far endpoint of P_{w,x} by identifying its root with that endpoint. Because the family over (w,x) is finite, indices can be chosen pairwise distinct.
Let F′ be the resulting finite refinement (an s′‑ball for some s′). By construction, G_{•}^{F′}⊂G_{•}^{F} and is nonempty in Δ≤D (extend by attaching infinite trees within degree budget). In Δ=D, nonemptiness follows from Lemma R since at least one vertex on the outer sphere has degree <D in F′ (this can be ensured by leaving some remote boundary vertex unsaturated; we used only finitely many degree budgets around W). Now take any (H,ρ)∈G_{•}^{F′}. Consider any w∈W (identified inside H) and two distinct neighbors u≠v of w in H. By construction, exactly one neighbor edge out of u (into its anchored pipe) leads after a unique path length L_{w,u} to a beacon B_{i(w,u)}, and similarly for v with B_{i(w,v)}; moreover, i(w,u)≠i(w,v). Hence the rooted graphs (H,u) and (H,v) are not isomorphic (the multiset of anchored beacon types around the root differs). Therefore no such w witnesses membership in Amb_k. Since this holds for every H extending F′, we have G_{•}^{F′}⊂G_{•}^{F}∖Amb_k. Thus Amb_k is nowhere dense. ∎
Remark. The argument fails for D=2: in the double ray every vertex has two neighbors with isomorphic rooted types; indeed Amb_1 is the whole space G_{•,=2}. Hence the restriction D≥3 is tight.

Saturation of nowhere‑dense sets is meagre (D≥3)
Lemma B (re‑root covering, recalled). For any nowhere‑dense N⊂G_{•,D} and k∈ℕ,
Sat_k(N) ⊆ Amb_k ∪ ⋃_{Θ∈𝒯_k} τ_Θ(N∩Dom(Θ)),
where 𝒯_k is the countable set of k‑step templates and each τ_Θ is a homeomorphism between clopen sets.
Proof. As in the previous round: along any length‑k re‑rooting path from (G,ρ)∈N to (G,σ), either at some step the next vertex is not uniquely identifiable among neighbors (placing (G,ρ)∈Amb_k), or all steps are locally unique and realized by some template Θ with τ_Θ(G,ρ)=(G,σ). ∎
Corollary C. For D≥3 and any nowhere‑dense N⊂G_{•,D}, Sat(N)=⋃_{k}Sat_k(N) is meagre. Indeed, Amb_k is nowhere dense by Proposition A and τ_Θ(N) is nowhere dense as the homeomorphic image of a nowhere‑dense set. Hence each Sat_k(N) is meagre and a countable union over k is meagre.

Consequences and checks
- This completes the saturation step promised earlier: for D≥3, re‑rooting a nowhere‑dense set yields a meagre set. It applies immediately to properties P whose S_P can be written as a saturation of a union of root‑local nowhere‑dense witnesses (e.g., “has a 2‑way infinite bridge” in Theorem 16). The meagre status for such P is therefore root‑invariant.  
- D=2 caveat: Amb_k need not be small (e.g., in G_{•,=2}, Amb_1=the whole space), so the corollary fails; special treatment is required for D=2.

Next steps
- Extend the corollary into a full meagre‑invariance theorem for all saturated S (D≥3): Using that ⋃_k Amb_k is meagre (countable union of nowhere‑dense sets), attempt to extract a nowhere‑dense transversal N⊂S with S=Sat(N) by selecting representatives inside S∖⋃_k Amb_k (comeagre in S). This requires a careful diagonal selection on a countable base of cylinders, ensuring N remains nowhere dense.  
- Provide explicit, written beacon libraries and degree bookkeeping for even/odd D in Δ= D (although the above proof uses only max degree ≤D beacons, a catalogue will be useful in other constructions).  
- Treat D=2 separately: classify meagre/n.d. saturated sets in the double‑ray/ray space and identify which parts of the conjecture can hold there.

Summary
- Established: For D≥3 and each k, Amb_k is nowhere dense via intrinsic beacon gadgets anchored beyond a finite radius, both in Δ≤D and Δ= D (using the reservoir completion).  
- Hence, for D≥3, the re‑root saturation of any nowhere‑dense set is meagre. This advances the meagre half of the conjecture substantially and yields root‑invariance for broad classes of unrooted properties expressible via root‑local nowhere‑dense witnesses.  
- D=2 is exceptional; a separate analysis is needed there.

Critical analysis and concrete improvements to the current writeup

High‑level assessment
- The nowhere‑dense half of the conjecture is essentially settled and can be presented root‑free via cylinders. The current output is on the right track.
- Several technical statements in Section 2 (metric facts and cylinder nonemptiness) need corrections to avoid off‑by‑one errors and to clarify feasibility of extensions under degree constraints.
- The proof sketches for Theorems 14–17 are too vague or contain flaws (notably the “attach a leaf” step for bridges and the parity remark for edge‑coloring). I propose corrected gadgets and outline degree bookkeeping needed to make these arguments rigorous.
- For the meagre half of the conjecture, avoid quotient arguments; instead, use local re‑rooting homeomorphisms on refined cylinders. I sketch a marker construction and a reduction scheme; completing it requires explicit gadgets and a comeagre coverage lemma.

1) Metric and topology: corrections and proofs
A) Neighborhood/cylinder equivalence (fix off‑by‑one). For R=\sup\{r∈ℕ: B_r(G,ρ)≅B_r(H,σ)\} and d_\bullet=2^{-R}, the correct relationships are:
- B_r(G,ρ)≅B_r(H,σ) ⇔ d_\bullet((G,ρ),(H,σ))≤2^{-r}.
- For every r and 0<ε≤2^{-(r+1)}: U_{2^{-r}+ε}((G,ρ))=\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{B_r(G,ρ)}.
Proof: If B_r agrees then R≥r, hence d≤2^{-r}<2^{-r}+ε. Conversely, if d<2^{-r}+ε≤2^{-r}+2^{-(r+1)}<2^{-r+1}, then d=2^{-q} with q≥r, hence B_r agrees.

B) Cylinders are clopen. For any finite rooted ball F, \mathbf{G}_\bullet^F is open by (A). It is closed since its complement is a finite union of cylinders that disagree with F at radius r. This should be stated explicitly.

C) Nonemptiness of cylinders under degree bounds (needed later to justify gadget availability).
Lemma 2.1 (≤D case). For an r‑ball F in \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,≤D}, \mathbf{G}_\bullet^F∩\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,≤D}≠∅ iff there exists a boundary vertex b at distance r with deg_F(b)<D.
Proof. Sufficiency: attach an infinite ≤D tree at any boundary stub; B_r unchanged. Necessity: if deg_F(w)=D for all vertices at distance r, then any new neighbor of a vertex at distance <r would lie at distance ≤r and would change B_r. Thus no infinite connected extension exists.
Lemma 2.2 (=D case). For an r‑ball F in \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}, \mathbf{G}_\bullet^F∩\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}≠∅ iff (i) deg_F(v)=D for all vertices at distance <r, and (ii) there exists a boundary vertex b at distance r with deg_F(b)<D.
Proof. Necessity: same distance argument. Sufficiency: for each boundary deficit, attach a disjoint infinite D‑regular tree; this yields a connected infinite D‑regular extension with B_r=F.

D) Baire property. Both \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,≤D} and \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D} are compact in the local topology (standard; see Aldous–Lyons 2007), hence Baire; “not meagre” follows. Please add this (with a reference) to justify “For all D>2, \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D} is not meagre.”

2) Root‑invariance of nowhere density: rigorous, root‑free presentation
Proposition 3.1 (closure/interior of saturated sets are saturated). If S⊆\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D} is saturated (closed under re‑rooting), then \overline{S} and Int(\overline{S}) are saturated.
Proof. For (G,ρ)∈\overline{S} and u∈V(G), fix t and choose r≥t+dist(ρ,u) with (H_r,σ_r)∈S and B_r(H_r,σ_r)≅B_r(G,ρ). Transport the root to the image u_r of u; saturation gives (H_r,u_r)∈S and B_t(H_r,u_r)≅B_t(G,u); thus (G,u)∈\overline{S}. The interior is a union of cylinders and hence saturated.
Corollary 3.2 (root‑invariance of ND). For an unrooted property P, S_P is saturated, and S_P is nowhere dense iff Int(\overline{S_P})=∅, which is root‑invariant.
Equivalent cylinder criterion (preferred for the main text). S_P is nowhere dense iff for every rooted r‑ball F there exists an r′‑ball F′ extending F with \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F′}∩S_P=∅. This is explicitly root‑free and avoids quotient subtleties.

3) Theorem 14 (bridgeless nowhere dense): flaws and fixes
Flaw (≤D case). The sketch “attach a leaf at the boundary” does not force a bridge in every extension: later the extension can create a cycle through the leaf by adding edges to boundary vertices, destroying the bridge.
Fix (≤D). Given any cylinder \mathbf{G}_\bullet^F, refine to F′ as follows: choose a vertex v at distance ≤r and build a finite, connected “core” C containing v; ensure that all vertices of C at distance <R from the root have degree D in F′, and exactly one boundary vertex z (at distance R) lies in C with deg_{F′}(z)=1 (its unique neighbor in C is a vertex w). All other boundary vertices (in or out of C) have degree D in F′. Then any infinite ≤D extension must attach to C only through z; removing the edge wz disconnects z together with the entire (necessarily infinite) outside from C, so wz is a 1‑way infinite bridge in every extension. This yields a subcylinder disjoint from the bridgeless set.
Fix (=D, odd D). We need exactly one external stub. Let V′ and E′ be the vertex/edge sets of the chosen finite ball F′; the “stub count” S(F′)=∑_{x∈V′}(D−deg_{F′}(x)) equals D|V′|−2|E′| (the number of half‑edges leaving F′). For odd D, S(F′)≡|V′| (mod 2), so by locally adding edges inside F′ (pairing deficits) we can reduce S(F′) to 1. Arrange that all vertices at distance <R have degree D in F′, and among boundary vertices exactly one z has D−deg_{F′}(z)=1; within F′ make z a leaf of C as above. In any D‑regular extension, the unique external edge must attach at z, and the internal edge to its unique neighbor is a 1‑way infinite bridge. This completes the odd‑regular case. The parity obstruction explains why the even‑regular case is excluded here.

4) Theorem 15 (no cut vertex is nowhere dense): needs a concrete gadget
Current sketch is too vague. A workable gadget (both ≤D and even =D): Build F′ with a vertex v and two internally saturated lobes L_1 and L_2 such that:
- All vertices of L_2 at the boundary are degree‑D within F′; thus no extension can attach to L_2 except via v.
- L_1 contains all boundary deficits that allow infinite continuation; thus every path from the outside to L_2 must pass through v.
- Ensure there is no internal v‑avoiding path between L_1 and L_2 in F′.
Then v is a cut vertex in every extension. Please add explicit degree counts to show feasibility under both constraints (≤D and =D, even D).

5) Theorem 16 (2‑way infinite bridge: meagre but not nowhere dense)
- Meagre: Define P_k = “there exists a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance ≤k from the root.” For any cylinder \mathbf{G}_\bullet^F, we can refine to F′ in which every edge at distance ≤k lies on a cycle formed as follows: push to a larger radius R≫r, choose two boundary vertices with slack (guaranteed by Lemma 2.1/2.2) reachable from the two endpoints by disjoint interior paths avoiding the edge, and add an external path between these boundary vertices in F′. This uses only boundary slack and does not alter B_r. Thus every extension has no bridges within distance ≤k. Hence each P_k is nowhere dense and ⋃_k P_k is meagre.
Caveat and fix: One must handle the case where some endpoint already has degree D in F. In ≤D, pick the interior path from the endpoint along existing edges; extra degree is only used at boundary vertices we control. In =D, ensure via the choice of F′ (extending F) that the connecting interior paths terminate at boundary vertices with D−deg_{F′}>0; this is always possible in nonempty cylinders by Lemma 2.2. This needs to be written carefully.
- Not nowhere dense (density). For every cylinder \mathbf{G}_\bullet^F choose two boundary vertices b_1,b_2 with deficits (exists by Lemma 2.1/2.2) and extend outside to two disjoint infinite trees T_1, T_2. Connect T_1 and T_2 by a single edge e outside the original ball. The resulting extension contains a 2‑way infinite bridge (e). Hence the property is dense. Conclude: meagre but not nowhere dense.

6) Theorem 17 (edge‑chromatic number): fix the parity error
Flaw. “Removing an edge preserves χ′=D+1 by parity” is false (e.g., K_3−e has χ′=2).
Fix. For each D≥3, let H be a finite D‑regular class‑2 simple graph (even D: K_{D+1}; odd D: snarks for D=3 and known class‑2 D‑regular families for higher odd D; cite Tashkinov/Kierstead results or a standard existence theorem). Given any cylinder, refine to a subcylinder whose r′‑ball contains H strictly inside and degree budgets are met. Any extension then has χ′≥χ′(H)=D+1, so the class‑1 set {χ′=D} is nowhere dense. Please replace the parity sentence by this forcing‑subgraph argument and add references.

7) Quotient by forgetting the root: caveat
Do not rely on π being open. For a rooted cylinder C, its saturation π^{-1}(π(C)) is typically F_σ, not open. Meagreness is not directly preserved under π; base all arguments in the rooted space using saturated sets and cylinder refinements.

8) Local re‑rooting homeomorphisms (toward meagre root‑invariance)
Lemma 8.1 (marker‑based local re‑rooting). Given an r‑ball F and a vertex u in F, there exists an extension F_mark (radius r′≥r) and cylinders U=\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F_\mathrm{mark}}, V=\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F_\mathrm{mark}[u]} such that re‑rooting at the (uniquely) marked copy of u defines a homeomorphism U→V.
Sketch. Extend along a chosen geodesic from the root to u and attach at a boundary vertex on this path a small rigid “beacon” tree whose isomorphism type is unique within the r′‑ball, thereby canonically identifying u (by a fixed offset from the beacon). Degree constraints: in ≤D use a boundary deficit; in =D first engineer a unique boundary deficit (odd D by parity pairing) to host the beacon. This gives local, root‑preserving homeomorphisms that can be iterated.
Remark. Meagreness is preserved under homeomorphism. If a saturated set S is nonmeagre on U, then its re‑rooted image is nonmeagre on V. A complete proof of meagre root‑invariance will follow if we cover a comeagre set by countably many such domains implementing all finite re‑rootings; this reduces to constructing a comeagre “marker‑ready” domain (technical but plausible).

9) Examples
- Counterexample to “attach a leaf” forcing. Start with any cylinder; append a leaf z at distance r+1. In an extension, add an outside path that connects z to a neighbor of its parent, creating a cycle through the leaf edge. The edge ceases to be a bridge. Hence degree‑saturation as in Section 3 is necessary.
- D=2 sanity check. Even regularity forbids a single external stub (parity), matching the exclusion of even D in Theorem 14(ii).

10) Next steps (actionable)
- Fix Section 2: incorporate the corrected neighborhood equivalence, clopen cylinders, and the nonemptiness criteria (with proofs).
- Replace Theorem 14’s leaf argument with the “unique external port via a leaf inside the core” construction; write the parity pairing proof for odd D in the regular case.
- Provide a precise cut‑vertex gadget for Theorem 15 with full degree bookkeeping in both ≤D and =D (even).
- For Theorem 16, expand both parts: (i) P_k nowhere dense with the boundary‑slack construction; (ii) density via explicit dumbbell extension. Address saturation pitfalls explicitly.
- For Theorem 17, delete the parity sentence and use forcing by embedding a finite class‑2 D‑regular H; add references for existence of H in odd D.
- Develop the marker gadgets for Lemma 8.1 uniformly in ≤D and =D, and prove that the domains of these partial re‑rootings cover a comeagre set; this will materially advance the meagre root‑invariance half of the conjecture.

### Typical properties of countable graphs: flows and bridges  
*(Extended abstract)*  

**Robert Šámal**\* · **Hadi Zamani**\*

#### Abstract
We have two aims. **First**, we study nowhere‑zero flows in countably infinite graphs, observing the different roles of two types of bridges. **Second**, we study how typical graphs with these types of bridges are. As there is no natural probability measure to use, we turn to an analytic approach: we study which sets are nowhere dense and which are meagre.

In finite graphs, bridges play a crucial role—it is easy to see that every flow assigns value \(0\) to every bridge. It is also known that graphs with a bridge are not typical: both dense random graphs and random regular graphs are bridgeless w.h.p. [3, 1]. We ask how this transfers to countable graphs. In Section 1 we explain differences between bridges and flows and, via compactness, we prove a version of Seymour’s 6‑flow theorem for countable graphs.

In Section 2 we explore nowhere‑dense and meagre sets. This is called for because the usual probabilistic models collapse: extending Erdős–Rényi to countably infinite graphs yields the Rado graph a.s., so we are effectively studying a single graph up to isomorphism. Attempting random regular graphs via the configuration model [1] would require a uniform distribution on perfect matchings of a countable set (e.g., neighbors of the first vertex), which does not exist. Consequently, we turn to Baire category: meagre/co‑meagre sets (also “first/second category”).

### 1. Nowhere‑zero flows for infinite graphs

**Definition 1 (weak flow).**  
Given an orientation \(D\) of a graph \(G\) and an abelian group \(A\), a **weak \(A\)‑flow** is a function \(\varphi:E(G)\to A\) such that **Kirchhoff’s law for each vertex cut** holds:
\[
\forall v\in V(G):\quad \sum_{e\in \delta^-(v)}\varphi(e)=\sum_{e\in \delta^+(v)}\varphi(e).
\]

**Definition 2 (strong flow).**  
Given \(D,G,A\) as above, a **strong \(A\)‑flow** is a function \(\varphi:E(G)\to A\) such that **Kirchhoff’s law for each cut** holds:
\[
\forall S\subseteq V(G):\quad \sum_{e\in \delta^+(S)}\varphi(e)=\sum_{e\in \delta^-(S)}\varphi(e).
\]

In either case, \(\varphi\) is a **nowhere‑zero** weak/strong \(A\)‑flow if \(\varphi^{-1}(0)=\varnothing\).

**Definition 3 (bridge).**  
An edge \(e\) of \(G\) is a **bridge** if deleting \(e\) increases the number of connected components. A bridge is **2‑way infinite** if both resulting components are infinite, and **1‑way infinite** otherwise.

Every strong flow is a weak flow. While the two notions are equivalent on finite graphs, they diverge on infinite graphs: e.g., on a two‑way infinite path, a nowhere‑zero weak \(A\)‑flow exists but a strong one does not. In [6] the authors construct a 3‑connected graph with two ends that admits a nowhere‑zero weak \(A\)‑flow but no nowhere‑zero strong \(A\)‑flow. Nearly all finite flow theorems extend to infinite **strong** \(A\)‑flows via topological compactness; here we use **logical** compactness to obtain:

**Theorem 4.**  
*A countably infinite, locally finite graph without a 1‑way infinite bridge has a nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow.*

### 2. Metric space of rooted connected graphs

Since no good probability measure exists for countable graphs, we study typicality via a metric topology and Baire category.

**Definition 5 (ε‑neighborhood).**  
For a metric space \((X,d)\) and \(x\in X\), the ε‑neighborhood is \(U_\varepsilon(x)=\{y\in X:\ d(x,y)<\varepsilon\}\). The closed neighborhood \(\overline{U}_\varepsilon(x)\) uses \(d(x,y)\le \varepsilon\).

**Definition 6 (open set).**  
A set \(U\subseteq X\) is open if \(\forall x\in U\ \exists \varepsilon>0:\ U_\varepsilon(x)\subseteq U\).

We now fix the graph space and metric.

**Definition 9 (space of rooted graphs).**  
Let \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) be the set of all connected rooted graphs (up to root‑preserving isomorphism). For \(D>2\), let \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) be those with all degrees \(\le D\), and \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) those with all degrees \(=D\).

**Definition 10 (r‑ball).**  
For \((G,v)\), the rooted r‑ball is
\[
B_r(G,v)=(\,G[\{y\in V(G): d(v,y)\le r\}],\,v\,).
\]

**Definition 11 (metric \(d_\bullet\)).**  
For \((G_1,v_1),(G_2,v_2)\in\mathbf{G}_\bullet\),
\[
d_\bullet\big((G_1,v_1),(G_2,v_2)\big)=\inf\{2^{-r} : B_r(G_1,v_1)\cong B_r(G_2,v_2)\}.
\]
This is a metric [5].

**Definition 12 (extensions of an r‑ball).**  
For an r‑ball \(F=B_r(G,v)\), define
\[
\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F=\{(G',v')\in \mathbf{G}_\bullet : B_r(G',v')\cong F\}.
\]

**Lemma 13 (basic facts in \((\mathbf{G}_\bullet,d_\bullet)\)).**  
- For each \((G,x)\), \(r\in\mathbb{N}\), and \(0<\varepsilon<1\):
  \[
  U_{2^{-r}+\varepsilon}((G,x))=U_{2^{-r}}((G,x))=\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{B_r(G,x)}.
  \]
- \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F\) is nonempty if \(F\) is an r‑ball in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) that contains a vertex of degree \< \(D\) at distance \(r\) from the root.
- A subset \(S\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) is nowhere dense iff
  \(\forall\) r‑balls \(F\ \exists\) r′‑ball \(F'\) with \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F'}\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F}\setminus S\).
- For all \(D>2\), \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) is not meagre.

### Main results on typical properties

**Theorem 14.**  
*The set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense (i) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) for all \(D>2\); and (ii) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) for all odd \(D>2\).*  
In D‑regular graphs with even \(D\), 1‑way infinite bridges cannot exist; instead we obtain:

**Theorem 15.**  
*The set of graphs without a cut vertex is nowhere dense in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

**Theorem 16.**  
*The set of graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge is meagre (but not nowhere dense) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

We also considered other (a)typical properties:

**Theorem 17.**  
*The set of graphs with edge‑chromatic number \(D\) is nowhere dense in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

### 3. Proof sketches

**Proof of Theorem 4 (sketch).**  
Let the vertices of \(G\) be \(v_1,v_2,\ldots\) and orient each edge \(\{v_i,v_j\}\) from the smaller to the larger index. For each radius \(r\), augment the r‑ball \(B_r(G,v_1)\) to a finite multigraph \(G_r\) by adding a sink vertex \(v_\infty\) and connecting boundary edges to \(v_\infty\). Introduce Boolean variables \(F_{e,1},\dots,F_{e,6}\) encoding which of six nonzero values an edge \(e\) receives, enforce exclusivity \(\bigvee_i F_{e,i}\) and \(\bigwedge_{j\ne i}\neg F_{e,j}\), and write linear parity constraints at each vertex (Kirchhoff’s law). Let \(F_{G_r}\) be the conjunction over vertices of \(G_r\); then every finite subset of the constraint family \(\{F_{G_r}\}_r\cup\{F_{e,i}\}_e\) is satisfiable (by [7]), hence by compactness [4] the whole set is satisfiable, yielding a nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow on \(G\).

**Proof idea for Theorem 14.**  
Given an r‑ball \(F\), construct an r′‑ball \(F'\) such that every extension of \(F'\) contains a bridge. For \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\), attach a leaf to a boundary vertex of degree \<\(D\). For \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) handle regularity via parity gadgets: define \(S(F)=\sum_{v\in L_r}(D-\deg v)\) where \(L_r\) is the boundary; use \(K_{D+1}-e\) gadgets and tree‑like expansions to force parity \(S(F)=1\), then attach a new vertex to create a bridge. Hence the bridgeless set is nowhere dense.

**Proof idea for Theorem 15.**  
In even \(D\)‑regular graphs, use gadgets to force a cut vertex; in odd \(D\) or degree‑bounded spaces, this also follows from the previous construction.

**Proof idea for Theorem 16.**  
Being “there is a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance \(k\)” is nowhere dense; take a union over \(k\in\mathbb{N}\) to get a meagre (but not nowhere‑dense) set.

**Proof idea for Theorem 17.**  
For each \(D\), there exist \(D\)‑regular graphs with \(\chi'(G)=D+1\) (even \(D\): complete graphs or any odd‑order \(D\)‑regular graph; odd \(D\): by Tutte’s theorem). Removing an edge preserves \(\chi'=D+1\) by parity. Embed parity gadgets within r‑balls so that every extension has edge‑chromatic number \(D+1\), hence the set is nowhere dense.

---

### 4. Future work (the conjectures)

**Question 18.** *Is the fact that a property is nowhere dense or meagre independent of the root?*  
A change of root gives one type of change of metric; however, many metrics on the space of countable graphs are possible.

**Question 19.** *Is there another metric on \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) where typical properties are different?*  
For instance, is there a metric in which **bridgeless graphs are typical**?

We also aim to investigate additional (a)typical properties in the spirit of Theorem 17.
