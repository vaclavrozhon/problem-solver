Nowhere density root-invariance is established via the cylinder criterion (root-free). Quotient-based openness remains invalid. Prover 2’s plan advances the meagre half: reduce Sat_k(N) to images of N plus Amb_k, and aim to show Amb_k nowhere dense using boundary-attached hubs and beacons (D≥3). The current beacon proof needs repair to avoid changing the given r-ball and to handle Δ=D interior saturation. Bridge/cut/edge-colouring gadgets need full degree-parity checks. Theorem 4’s finite satisfiability remains unclear.
