## Setting

- Fix an integer \(D \ge 2\).
- Let \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) be the space of **countably infinite, connected, rooted graphs** \((G,\rho)\).
- For \((G,\rho) \in \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) and \(r \in \mathbb{N}\), let \(B_r(G,\rho)\) denote the rooted (closed) ball of radius \(r\) about \(\rho\).
- Equip \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) with the **local (Benjamini–Schramm) metric** \(d_\bullet\) given by
  \[
  d_\bullet\big((G,\rho),(H,\sigma)\big)=2^{-R},
  \qquad
  R=\sup\{r\in\mathbb{N} : B_r(G,\rho)\cong B_r(H,\sigma)\}.
  \]
  (Equivalently, \(d_\bullet((G,\rho),(H,\sigma))<2^{-r}\) iff \(B_r(G,\rho)\cong B_r(H,\sigma)\).)
- Degree‑constrained subspaces:
  - \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\): all rooted graphs with \(\Delta(G)\le D\).
  - \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,= D}\): all rooted graphs with \(\Delta(G)= D\).
  We write \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for either of these when the distinction is unimportant.
- A subset \(S\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) is **nowhere dense** if the interior of \(\overline{S}\) is empty. A set is **meagre** (first category) if it is a countable union of nowhere dense sets; its complement is **comeagre**. A property is called **typical** if the corresponding set is comeagre.
- An edge \(e\) of an (unrooted) graph \(G\) is a **bridge** if \(G-e\) has more connected components than \(G\). A bridge is **2‑way infinite** if both components are infinite and **1‑way infinite** otherwise.

# Research Notes



Conjecture (Root‑invariance of smallness). For an unrooted property P and S_P={ (G,\rho) in G_{\bullet,D} : G has P }, does the nowhere‑dense/meagre status of S_P depend on root choices?

Agreed notions
- Saturated sets: S is saturated if (G,\rho) in S implies (G,u) in S for every vertex u of G. For unrooted P, S_P is saturated.
- Cylinders form a clopen base in the local topology, hence nowhere density can be witnessed by refining cylinders.

Key lemma (settled). If S is saturated, then cl(S) and Int(cl(S)) are saturated. Sketch: For (G,\rho) in cl(S) and u in V(G), for each t pick r≫dist(\rho,u)+t and (H_r,\sigma_r) in S with B_r matching at the root; transport the root to the image of u and use saturation to see (H_r,u_r) in S with B_t(H_r,u_r)≅B_t(G,u). Thus (G,u) in cl(S). Interior of a saturated set is saturated because open sets are unions of cylinders and re‑rooting preserves membership.

Consequence (nowhere density is root‑invariant). S is nowhere dense iff Int(cl(S))=\emptyset. For saturated S this condition is root‑free; applied to S_P it proves the ND half of the conjecture.

Caveat on quotients. Let π: G_{\bullet,D}→U_q be the quotient by forgetting the root. In general, π maps open cylinders to sets whose preimages are the saturations of those cylinders, which need not be open; π(C) need not be open. Thus arguments that rely on π being open are invalid. Any quotient‑based comparison must work with saturated open sets only, or with a selector on a comeagre domain.

Meagre part: current route and plan. Define Good_∞ (comeagre local rigidity): around the root and finitely many steps, distinct neighbors are eventually distinguishable. Using (degree‑preserving) markers, each Bad_{m,\ell} should be nowhere dense; this yields a comeagre domain on which countably many partial re‑rooting homeomorphisms generate all finite re‑rootings. Then: the saturation of a nowhere‑dense set is meagre (countable union of homeomorphic images of a nowhere‑dense set plus a meagre exceptional set). This would imply meagreness for many S_P constructed as saturations of root‑local nowhere‑dense witnesses. Completing this requires explicit marker gadgets in both Δ≤D and Δ= D (odd/even cases).

Open items
- Finish the Good_∞ construction with uniform markers in Δ= D and write the proof that each Bad_{m,\ell} is nowhere dense.
- Either produce a Borel/continuous selector on a comeagre domain (unique marked root) to compare meagreness between U_q and the rooted space, or construct a counterexample showing full meagre equivalence can fail without extra structure.
- Optional: record the metric off‑by‑one correction and the safe non‑emptiness criterion for cylinders (≤D is straightforward).

Clarification: Nowhere-density root-invariance does not require that Int(cl(S)) be saturated. For an unrooted property P, S_P is saturated and the cylinder criterion yields a root-free formulation: S_P is nowhere dense iff for every rooted r-ball F there is an extension F′ such that every D-bounded connected graph containing a copy of F′ (at some vertex) fails P. This avoids any subtlety about interiors of closures.

Caveat on quotients: The forget-the-root quotient map π need not send cylinders to open sets in the quotient of the rooted topology; saturations of cylinders are typically not open. Thus arguments that rely on π being open (or category-preserving) are invalid. Work directly with the rooted clopen cylinder basis.

Meagre part plan update: Replace the previous “Bad_{m,ℓ} is nowhere dense” approach (false in general) by the Amb_k reduction: for nowhere-dense N, Sat_k(N) is covered by countably many homeomorphic images of N plus the ambiguity set Amb_k (points where some step of re-rooting is not uniquely determined). If we can show each Amb_k is meagre via intrinsic markers (degree-preserving gadgets in ≤D and =D), then Sat(N) is meagre. Action items: design explicit port/marker gadgets and prove the Amb_k meagreness. Also, fix parity/scope issues for regular even D (no bridges) in related theorems.

Meagre part: boundary-hub beacon scheme (D≥3)
- Goal: Show Amb_k (exists w within distance ≤k with two neighbors u≠v s.t. (G,u)≅(G,v)) is nowhere dense. This, with the re-rooting template covering, implies: saturation of a nowhere-dense set is meagre.
- Constraint: Refining a cylinder C(F) must preserve B_r(F). Hence no new edges may be added at vertices with dist<r from the root. All modifications must occur at the outer sphere (dist=r) or beyond.
- Plan (Δ≤D): Given nonempty C(F), pick a boundary vertex b with deg_F(b)<D. Attach a finite hub H beyond b using only one additional edge at b. For each controlled pair (w,x) with dist(root,w)≤k and x∈N_F(w): choose an existing path inside F from x to b (no new edges inside B_r), and reserve a distinct branch in H ending at a beacon B_i (pairwise non-isomorphic) at a chosen depth L(w,x). Choose indices/depths so that for any neighbors u,v of w, the multisets of (beacon type, distance from root at u) and at v differ; then (G,u)≇(G,v) in any completion. Degree budgets are respected since only b gains one new incident edge; all other attachments occur in the newly added hub.
- Plan (Δ=D): First choose a larger radius R≫r and build F′ so that every vertex at dist< R has degree D within F′, and at least one vertex on the outer sphere dist=R has spare capacity (leave one stub). Attach the hub at that outer sphere vertex and proceed as above. Only outer sphere vertices get new edges; hence any D-regular completion that preserves B_R=F′ exists (attach the remaining stubs outside), and Amb_k is avoided within C(F′).
- Tasks: (i) Formalize the choice of indices/depths to guarantee distinct neighbor-root signature multisets at u vs v; (ii) Write explicit degree bookkeeping and a completion lemma for Δ=D ensuring B_R remains fixed; (iii) Treat D=2 separately (Amb_1 is large; the above fails).

Corrections and caveats
- ND root-invariance: use the cylinder criterion (root-free) only; Int(cl(S)) saturation is unnecessary. 
- Quotients: Saturations of cylinders are typically not open; avoid quotient-openness arguments.
- Bridges/cuts: Replace naive ‘attach a leaf’ forcing by port/hub gadgets that ensure unique external connections in all completions; check parity (no 1-way bridges in any D-regular graph).

# Main Results

Theorem (Root-invariance of nowhere density). Fix D≥2. Let P be any property of unrooted graphs and let S_P={ (G,\rho) in G_{\bullet,D} : G has P }. Then S_P is nowhere dense in (G_{\bullet,D},d_\bullet) if and only if the following equivalent, root-free condition holds:
For every rooted r-ball F there exists an extension r′-ball F′ with G_{\bullet}^{F′}⊆G_{\bullet}^{F} such that for every D-bounded connected graph H and vertex v with B_{r′}(H,v)≅F′, the unrooted graph H does not have P.
In particular, whether S_P is nowhere dense does not depend on how graphs are rooted.

Proof. Cylinders G_{\bullet}^{F} form a clopen base of the local topology. If S_P is nowhere dense, then for each r-ball F there exists a subcylinder G_{\bullet}^{F′}⊆G_{\bullet}^{F} with G_{\bullet}^{F′}∩S_P=\emptyset. Hence any (H,v) whose r′-ball equals F′ lies outside S_P, so H fails P. Conversely, if such F′ exists for each F, then every nonempty cylinder contains a subcylinder disjoint from S_P, which is equivalent to S_P being nowhere dense. This criterion refers only to P and D, not to a chosen root, establishing root-invariance. ∎

Note. The meagre part of the conjecture remains open in full generality. A promising route proceeds via covering the re-root saturations of nowhere-dense sets by countably many homeomorphic images plus a small ambiguity set; proving that the ambiguity set is meagre (via degree-preserving marker gadgets) would settle meagre root-invariance for broad classes of properties.


=== Round 2 Summary ===

Proved (now rigorous): for any unrooted property P the set S_P = {(G,ρ): G has P} is saturated, and for any saturated S the closure cl(S) and interior Int(cl(S)) are also saturated (proof by transporting large matching balls and re‑rooting). Hence Int(cl(S_P))=∅ is root‑free, so nowhere density of S_P does not depend on the choice of root — the conjecture is resolved for nowhere density. Caveat: the quotient map that forgets the root need not be open, so meagreness cannot be transferred via a naive quotient argument. Current plan for the meagre part: build a comeagre locally rigid domain Good_∞ via degree‑preserving markers so countably many partial re‑rooting homeomorphisms generate finite re‑rootings there; show each Bad_{m,ℓ} is nowhere dense so Good_∞ is comeagre; conclude that saturations of nowhere‑dense sets are meagre. Remaining technical work: explicit marker gadgets (especially for Δ= D, odd/even) and either a Borel/continuous selector on a comeagre domain or a counterexample. Citations: Current Proofs; papers/paper1.txt.


=== Round 3 Summary ===

Last round: proved that nowhere density of S_P is independent of the root. Key lemma: for any saturated S, cl(S) and Int(cl(S)) are saturated (proved by transporting large matching balls and re‑rooting). Equivalently, gave a root‑free cylinder criterion: S_P is nowhere dense iff every rooted r‑ball F has an extension F' whose cylinder is disjoint from S_P. Hence nowhere‑dense status of any unrooted property P is root‑invariant. The meagre part remains open; proposed route: build a comeagre locally rigid Good_∞ via degree‑preserving marker gadgets, reduce saturations Sat(N) to countably many homeomorphic images plus ambiguity sets Amb_k, and prove Amb_k are meagre (or else produce a Borel selector on a comeagre domain). Note: the forget‑the‑root quotient need not be open, so naive quotient arguments fail. Citations: Current Proofs; papers/paper1.txt.


=== Round 4 Summary ===

Last round settled the nowhere‑density half of the conjecture: for any unrooted property P the set S_P is saturated, and we proved that for any saturated S the closure cl(S) and interior Int(cl(S)) are saturated. Equivalently, we gave a root‑free cylinder criterion: S_P is nowhere dense iff every rooted r‑ball F admits an extension F' whose cylinder is disjoint from S_P. Hence nowhere‑density of S_P does not depend on the root. The meagre half remains open; it was reduced to showing that saturations of nowhere‑dense sets are meagre by covering Sat_k(N) with countably many homeomorphic images of N plus ambiguity sets Amb_k, and proving each Amb_k is meagre via degree‑preserving marker gadgets. A concrete boundary‑hub/beacon scheme (Δ≤D vs Δ=D, parity/regularity issues, and a D=2 special case) was sketched; remaining work is formalizing indices/depths, degree bookkeeping, and completion lemmas. Note: the forget‑the‑root quotient need not be open, so quotient arguments for meagreness fail. Citations: Current Proofs; papers/paper1.txt


=== Previous Round Feedback ===

Main status: The nowhere-dense (ND) half is correct as stated in Current Output via the cylinder criterion; it avoids quotient subtleties and does not need Int(cl(S)) to be saturated. The meagre half has nontrivial remaining work; Prover 2’s new Amb_k strategy is promising but needs significant repairs to respect the cylinder constraints and degree budgets.

Prover 1
- The quotient approach still relies on an invalid step: images of cylinders under the forget-the-root map π need not be open; saturations of cylinders are typically F_sigma, not open. Your ND/meagre equivalences through U_q therefore lack justification. Provide a concrete non-openness example (e.g., the saturation of the “root has degree 1” cylinder) and avoid quotient-based openness in arguments.

Prover 2
- Positive: A clear reduction of Sat_k(N) to countably many homeomorphic images of N plus Amb_k, and a concrete plan to make Amb_k small. However, the current beacon proof for “Amb_k is nowhere dense” starts new pipes with the first edge at interior vertices x, which would alter the given r-ball F and is invalid for refining cylinders.
- Fix: Use only attachments at or beyond the outer sphere of the given cylinder. From a nonempty cylinder, pick one boundary vertex with spare degree (guaranteed) and attach a large finite hub there. For each controlled pair (w, x) with dist(ρ,w)≤k and x∈N(w), route along an existing path inside F from x to that boundary vertex and then through disjoint branches in the hub to distinct beacons B_i at pairwise distinct depths. Choose beacon types/lengths so the multiset of signatures seen at u differs from that at v, breaking (G,u)≅(G,v). This respects B_r and degree budgets in Δ≤D. For Δ=D, first ensure F′ saturates all vertices at distance <R to degree D, leaving at least one boundary stub at distance R; only add edges at the boundary while building the hub. Provide full degree bookkeeping and a completion lemma (edges added only from the outer sphere) to keep B_R fixed.
- D=2 remains exceptional as noted.

Prover 3
- Good metric corrections and a valid proof that closures of saturated sets are saturated. Do not rely on “Int(cl(S)) is saturated”; it is unnecessary. Your gadget guidance for Theorems 14–17 is useful, but the ≤D “attach a leaf” forcing is insufficient (later extensions can create cycles through the leaf). Replace by a port/hub construction that forces exactly one external connection (for bridges) or forces cut vertices as specified, with explicit parity/degree checks.

Concrete next steps
- P2: Write the full hub-at-the-boundary proof that Amb_k is nowhere dense for D≥3 in both Δ≤D and Δ=D, including (i) keeping B_r intact, (ii) degree feasibility, (iii) interior saturation for Δ=D, and (iv) a completion lemma that only uses outer-sphere attachments. Then derive “saturation of nowhere dense ⇒ meagre” rigorously for D≥3.
- P3: Supply complete gadgets and proofs for Theorems 14–17 with explicit degree bookkeeping; correct the parity statements (no 1-way bridges in any D-regular graph; 2-way bridges possible for even D).
- P1: Remove quotient-openness claims; if quotient is used, work only with saturated opens or provide a selector on a comeagre domain.
- All: Fix Theorem 4’s finite satisfiability step with an applicable finite result or a modified augmentation that guarantees consistency.

### Typical properties of countable graphs: flows and bridges  
*(Extended abstract)*  

**Robert Šámal**\* · **Hadi Zamani**\*

#### Abstract
We have two aims. **First**, we study nowhere‑zero flows in countably infinite graphs, observing the different roles of two types of bridges. **Second**, we study how typical graphs with these types of bridges are. As there is no natural probability measure to use, we turn to an analytic approach: we study which sets are nowhere dense and which are meagre.

In finite graphs, bridges play a crucial role—it is easy to see that every flow assigns value \(0\) to every bridge. It is also known that graphs with a bridge are not typical: both dense random graphs and random regular graphs are bridgeless w.h.p. [3, 1]. We ask how this transfers to countable graphs. In Section 1 we explain differences between bridges and flows and, via compactness, we prove a version of Seymour’s 6‑flow theorem for countable graphs.

In Section 2 we explore nowhere‑dense and meagre sets. This is called for because the usual probabilistic models collapse: extending Erdős–Rényi to countably infinite graphs yields the Rado graph a.s., so we are effectively studying a single graph up to isomorphism. Attempting random regular graphs via the configuration model [1] would require a uniform distribution on perfect matchings of a countable set (e.g., neighbors of the first vertex), which does not exist. Consequently, we turn to Baire category: meagre/co‑meagre sets (also “first/second category”).

### 1. Nowhere‑zero flows for infinite graphs

**Definition 1 (weak flow).**  
Given an orientation \(D\) of a graph \(G\) and an abelian group \(A\), a **weak \(A\)‑flow** is a function \(\varphi:E(G)\to A\) such that **Kirchhoff’s law for each vertex cut** holds:
\[
\forall v\in V(G):\quad \sum_{e\in \delta^-(v)}\varphi(e)=\sum_{e\in \delta^+(v)}\varphi(e).
\]

**Definition 2 (strong flow).**  
Given \(D,G,A\) as above, a **strong \(A\)‑flow** is a function \(\varphi:E(G)\to A\) such that **Kirchhoff’s law for each cut** holds:
\[
\forall S\subseteq V(G):\quad \sum_{e\in \delta^+(S)}\varphi(e)=\sum_{e\in \delta^-(S)}\varphi(e).
\]

In either case, \(\varphi\) is a **nowhere‑zero** weak/strong \(A\)‑flow if \(\varphi^{-1}(0)=\varnothing\).

**Definition 3 (bridge).**  
An edge \(e\) of \(G\) is a **bridge** if deleting \(e\) increases the number of connected components. A bridge is **2‑way infinite** if both resulting components are infinite, and **1‑way infinite** otherwise.

Every strong flow is a weak flow. While the two notions are equivalent on finite graphs, they diverge on infinite graphs: e.g., on a two‑way infinite path, a nowhere‑zero weak \(A\)‑flow exists but a strong one does not. In [6] the authors construct a 3‑connected graph with two ends that admits a nowhere‑zero weak \(A\)‑flow but no nowhere‑zero strong \(A\)‑flow. Nearly all finite flow theorems extend to infinite **strong** \(A\)‑flows via topological compactness; here we use **logical** compactness to obtain:

**Theorem 4.**  
*A countably infinite, locally finite graph without a 1‑way infinite bridge has a nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow.*

### 2. Metric space of rooted connected graphs

Since no good probability measure exists for countable graphs, we study typicality via a metric topology and Baire category.

**Definition 5 (ε‑neighborhood).**  
For a metric space \((X,d)\) and \(x\in X\), the ε‑neighborhood is \(U_\varepsilon(x)=\{y\in X:\ d(x,y)<\varepsilon\}\). The closed neighborhood \(\overline{U}_\varepsilon(x)\) uses \(d(x,y)\le \varepsilon\).

**Definition 6 (open set).**  
A set \(U\subseteq X\) is open if \(\forall x\in U\ \exists \varepsilon>0:\ U_\varepsilon(x)\subseteq U\).

We now fix the graph space and metric.

**Definition 9 (space of rooted graphs).**  
Let \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) be the set of all connected rooted graphs (up to root‑preserving isomorphism). For \(D>2\), let \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) be those with all degrees \(\le D\), and \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) those with all degrees \(=D\).

**Definition 10 (r‑ball).**  
For \((G,v)\), the rooted r‑ball is
\[
B_r(G,v)=(\,G[\{y\in V(G): d(v,y)\le r\}],\,v\,).
\]

**Definition 11 (metric \(d_\bullet\)).**  
For \((G_1,v_1),(G_2,v_2)\in\mathbf{G}_\bullet\),
\[
d_\bullet\big((G_1,v_1),(G_2,v_2)\big)=\inf\{2^{-r} : B_r(G_1,v_1)\cong B_r(G_2,v_2)\}.
\]
This is a metric [5].

**Definition 12 (extensions of an r‑ball).**  
For an r‑ball \(F=B_r(G,v)\), define
\[
\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F=\{(G',v')\in \mathbf{G}_\bullet : B_r(G',v')\cong F\}.
\]

**Lemma 13 (basic facts in \((\mathbf{G}_\bullet,d_\bullet)\)).**  
- For each \((G,x)\), \(r\in\mathbb{N}\), and \(0<\varepsilon<1\):
  \[
  U_{2^{-r}+\varepsilon}((G,x))=U_{2^{-r}}((G,x))=\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{B_r(G,x)}.
  \]
- \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F\) is nonempty if \(F\) is an r‑ball in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) that contains a vertex of degree \< \(D\) at distance \(r\) from the root.
- A subset \(S\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) is nowhere dense iff
  \(\forall\) r‑balls \(F\ \exists\) r′‑ball \(F'\) with \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F'}\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F}\setminus S\).
- For all \(D>2\), \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) is not meagre.

### Main results on typical properties

**Theorem 14.**  
*The set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense (i) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) for all \(D>2\); and (ii) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) for all odd \(D>2\).*  
In D‑regular graphs with even \(D\), 1‑way infinite bridges cannot exist; instead we obtain:

**Theorem 15.**  
*The set of graphs without a cut vertex is nowhere dense in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

**Theorem 16.**  
*The set of graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge is meagre (but not nowhere dense) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

We also considered other (a)typical properties:

**Theorem 17.**  
*The set of graphs with edge‑chromatic number \(D\) is nowhere dense in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

### 3. Proof sketches

**Proof of Theorem 4 (sketch).**  
Let the vertices of \(G\) be \(v_1,v_2,\ldots\) and orient each edge \(\{v_i,v_j\}\) from the smaller to the larger index. For each radius \(r\), augment the r‑ball \(B_r(G,v_1)\) to a finite multigraph \(G_r\) by adding a sink vertex \(v_\infty\) and connecting boundary edges to \(v_\infty\). Introduce Boolean variables \(F_{e,1},\dots,F_{e,6}\) encoding which of six nonzero values an edge \(e\) receives, enforce exclusivity \(\bigvee_i F_{e,i}\) and \(\bigwedge_{j\ne i}\neg F_{e,j}\), and write linear parity constraints at each vertex (Kirchhoff’s law). Let \(F_{G_r}\) be the conjunction over vertices of \(G_r\); then every finite subset of the constraint family \(\{F_{G_r}\}_r\cup\{F_{e,i}\}_e\) is satisfiable (by [7]), hence by compactness [4] the whole set is satisfiable, yielding a nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow on \(G\).

**Proof idea for Theorem 14.**  
Given an r‑ball \(F\), construct an r′‑ball \(F'\) such that every extension of \(F'\) contains a bridge. For \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\), attach a leaf to a boundary vertex of degree \<\(D\). For \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) handle regularity via parity gadgets: define \(S(F)=\sum_{v\in L_r}(D-\deg v)\) where \(L_r\) is the boundary; use \(K_{D+1}-e\) gadgets and tree‑like expansions to force parity \(S(F)=1\), then attach a new vertex to create a bridge. Hence the bridgeless set is nowhere dense.

**Proof idea for Theorem 15.**  
In even \(D\)‑regular graphs, use gadgets to force a cut vertex; in odd \(D\) or degree‑bounded spaces, this also follows from the previous construction.

**Proof idea for Theorem 16.**  
Being “there is a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance \(k\)” is nowhere dense; take a union over \(k\in\mathbb{N}\) to get a meagre (but not nowhere‑dense) set.

**Proof idea for Theorem 17.**  
For each \(D\), there exist \(D\)‑regular graphs with \(\chi'(G)=D+1\) (even \(D\): complete graphs or any odd‑order \(D\)‑regular graph; odd \(D\): by Tutte’s theorem). Removing an edge preserves \(\chi'=D+1\) by parity. Embed parity gadgets within r‑balls so that every extension has edge‑chromatic number \(D+1\), hence the set is nowhere dense.

---

### 4. Future work (the conjectures)

**Question 18.** *Is the fact that a property is nowhere dense or meagre independent of the root?*  
A change of root gives one type of change of metric; however, many metrics on the space of countable graphs are possible.

**Question 19.** *Is there another metric on \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) where typical properties are different?*  
For instance, is there a metric in which **bridgeless graphs are typical**?

We also aim to investigate additional (a)typical properties in the spirit of Theorem 17.
