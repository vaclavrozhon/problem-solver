Your Current Output already states a correct, root-free criterion for S_P being ND. Keep this and avoid extraneous claims about Int(cl(S)).\\n- The meagre half remains unsettled. The \u201cambiguity sets Amb_k\u201d route could work, but the present sketch contains a key flaw (see below) and needs a careful, degree-aware, outer-shell rigidification that respects cylinders.\\n\\nSpecific flaws and corrections\\n1) Off-by-one in the metric equivalence.\\n- You state \u201cd_\u2022((G,\u03c1),(H,\u03c3)) < 2^{-r} iff B_r(G,\u03c1)\u2245B_r(H,\u03c3)\u201d. Correct is: d_\u2022 \u2264 2^{-r} iff B_r agrees; and d_\u2022 < 2^{-r} iff B_{r+1} agrees. Please fix all uses to avoid later mismatches in radii.\\n\\n2) \u201cInt(cl(S)) is saturated\u201d is unproven and unnecessary.\\n- Your sketch \u201copen sets are unions of cylinders and re-rooting preserves membership\u201d is invalid: re-rooting does not preserve membership in a given cylinder. Do not use this claim. What you need and can prove rigorously is: closure of a saturated set is saturated.\\n- Lemma (closure of saturated is saturated). If S\u2286G_{\\\\bullet,D} is saturated and (G,\u03c1)\u2208cl(S), then for any u\u2208V(G) and t\u2208N there exists r\u226bdist(\u03c1,u)+t and (H_r,\u03c3_r)\u2208S with B_r(H_r,\u03c3_r)\u2245B_r(G,\u03c1); let u_r be the image of u; then (H_r,u_r)\u2208S (by saturation) and B_t(H_r,u_r)\u2245B_t(G,u), hence (G,u)\u2208cl(S).\\n- Consequence: The cylinder refinement criterion yields a root-free ND characterization for S_P (already in your Current Output). No further saturation of Int(cl(S)) is needed.\\n\\n3) Saturations of cylinders are not open; quotient arguments must be handled with care.\\n- Counterexample: Let F be the 1-ball of a leaf-root. C(F)={root has degree 1}. Its saturation Sat(C(F))={has a leaf somewhere} is not open: in any neighborhood of a rooted graph whose unique leaf lies very far, you can delete that far leaf outside the prescribed ball without altering the ball; hence the neighborhood intersects the complement. Thus, for the forget-the-root map \u03c0, \u03c0(C(F)) need not be open in any unrooted space derived from G_{\\\\bullet,D} via quotient. Avoid relying on \u03c0 being open.\\n\\n4) Parity and bridges in regular graphs: fix scope and statements.\\n- 1-way infinite bridges cannot occur in any D-regular graph (all D\u22652): if an edge e is a bridge with a finite side S, then |\u03b4(S)|=1 and \u2211_{v\u2208S}deg_G(v)=D|S|\u22121 is odd, contradicting the handshake lemma on the finite induced subgraph. Replace \u201cin even D\u201d by \u201cin all D\u201d.\\n- 2-way infinite bridges may exist for even D (e.g., the D-regular tree). Adjust the narrative in Theorems 14\u201316 accordingly.\\n\\n5) Theorem 14 (bridgeless is nowhere dense): \u0394\u2264D vs \u0394=D requires explicit, degree-aware gadgets.\\n- \u0394\u2264D: the \u201cattach a leaf at the boundary\u201d refinement needs a completion lemma: given a nonempty cylinder C(F) with a boundary vertex b of deg_F(b)<D, attaching a pendant leaf at b within the next radius yields a subcylinder whose every completion has a 1-way infinite bridge. Provide the short proof: every completion must keep that leaf pendant\u2014no other path can reach it without altering the prescribed ball\u2014so the incident edge is a bridge with a finite side.\\n- \u0394= D: 1-way bridges are impossible. You need a port/hub gadget that ensures exactly one external connection in any D-regular completion and makes that edge a 2-way infinite bridge. Concretely: saturate all boundary degrees except two designated vertices x,y by internal wiring; leave x,y with exactly one free stub each. Then any D-regular completion must use exactly one external edge at x and exactly one at y; force that x and y lie in different infinite components beyond the ball and are connected by a single edge (or construct two disjoint \u201cports\u201d that any completion must connect uniquely). Provide the finite gadget and a completion lemma guaranteeing nonemptiness in \u0394=D.\\n\\n6) Theorem 16 (2-way infinite bridges are meagre but not ND): scope and full proof needed.\\n- Scope: holds in \u0394\u2264D (all D\u22652). In \u0394=D it also holds (the set is nonempty for both odd and even D). State the scope precisely.\\n- ND decomposition: For each k, let B_k be the set \u201cthere exists a 2-way infinite bridge with midpoint at distance \u2264k from the root.\u201d From any cylinder, refine by adding small cycles through all edges within distance \u2264k so no such edge can be a bridge in any completion. This shows B_k is nowhere dense. Provide the explicit construction and degree budget (in \u0394=D, use internal saturations so degrees remain D and completions exist).\\n- Density: Given a cylinder, complete arbitrarily and far outside splice two infinite components and connect by a single edge (in \u0394\u2264D), or prepare two outer ports (in \u0394=D) and connect them by a single edge. This yields a completion in the property; hence the union \u22c3_k B_k is dense, so not nowhere dense.\\n\\n7) Theorem 17 (\u03c7\u2032=D is nowhere dense): supply explicit class-2 finite subgraphs and extension details.\\n- For even D, take K_{D+1}. For odd D\u22653, fix a known class-2 D-regular graph (Petersen for D=3; cite a general construction for odd D). Embed it inside an r\u2032-ball and saturate boundary degrees to \u2264D (or =D) so any completion contains it; conclude \u03c7\u2032\u2265D+1 in every completion.\\n\\n8) Theorem 4 (weak 6-flows) finite satisfiability is unclear.\\n- The augmented finite graphs G_r with a sink v_\u221e may have bridges, so invoking Seymour\u2019s 6-flow theorem for bridgeless graphs is not directly applicable. Either: (a) modify the augmentation to ensure the finite constraint system you impose is known to be solvable (e.g., ensure Eulerian conditions and no cut encountering 1-way effects), and cite a finite weak-flow theorem; or (b) give a direct argument that every finite subset of your Boolean+parity constraints is satisfiable on G_r. Provide precise references (what is [7] here?) and a compatibility argument across r.\\n\\nAmbiguity sets Amb_k: fix the flaw and outline a correct rigidification\\n- Flaw in current sketch: Decorating only beyond a single boundary vertex b cannot break (G,u)\u2245(G,v) if u and v are symmetric within the fixed r-ball; outside decorations seen via b are the same from both roots and can be permuted by an isomorphism extending an interior symmetry. Thus the proposed \u201chub at b with beacons\u201d is insufficient.\\n- Corrected strategy (outer-shell rigidification, \u0394\u2264D, D\u22653): From a nonempty cylinder C(F) and k, choose R\u226br+k and define a refined r\u2032-ball F\u2032 with layers from r+1 to R under your control. For each boundary vertex at level r, attach exactly one new neighbor at level r+1 and, beyond it, build a large finite \u201csignature tree\u201d (degree \u2264D) whose leaf signatures are pairwise non-isomorphic across different boundary vertices. This forces any automorphism fixing the outermost sphere to fix all vertices at level r+1, hence at level r, and inductively all vertices within distance \u2264k of the root. Additionally, vary the depths of certain unique beacons so that, for each vertex w at distance \u2264k and its distinct neighbors u\u2260v, the multisets of distances from u and v to the nearest beacon(s) differ; this guarantees (G,u) and (G,v) are not isomorphic as rooted graphs in any completion. Only vertices outside B_r receive new edges.\\n- \u0394= D: first choose R\u2265r so that some boundary vertex has spare degree (nonempty cylinder implies existence). Saturate degrees within the new shells so all vertices at distance <R have degree D in F\u2032 while leaving exactly one \u201cport\u201d at some boundary vertex to anchor the rigidifying trees. Use the same beacon variation and provide a completion lemma showing D-regular completions exist.\\n- Deliverables to make this rigorous: (i) a clear definition of the signature trees to ensure pairwise non-isomorphism; (ii) precise degree bookkeeping; (iii) proof that the pointwise stabilizer of the outer sphere is trivial on the inner radius \u2264k; (iv) for \u0394=D, a completion lemma ensuring nonemptiness of the refined cylinder.\\n- Outcome: Each Amb_k is nowhere dense. With a standard re-rooting template coverage (saturation by countably many finite path moves), one can then deduce: the saturation of a nowhere-dense set is meagre on a comeagre domain, completing the meagre half for D\u22653 (details still to be written).\\n\\nAdditional minor fixes\\n- Lemma 13 (nonemptiness). The second bullet gives a sufficient condition for \u0394\u2264D. Please either restrict it to \u0394\u2264D explicitly and add the short constructive proof, or state a correct criterion for \u0394=D (nontrivial and not needed if you avoid it). Also correct the global claim \u201cfor all D>2, G_{\\\\bullet,D} is not meagre\u201d: the whole space of infinite \u0394\u2264D rooted graphs is Baire (indeed Polish), but spell out the subspace you work in (exclude finite graphs explicitly).\\n\\nNext steps (concrete and auditable)\\n- Replace the ND proof by the cylinder refinement criterion (already correct in Current Output) and remove the claim about Int(cl(S)). Add the short proof that closure of a saturated set is saturated.\\n- Insert the explicit non-openness example for saturation of a cylinder to justify the quotient caveat.\\n- Correct parity statements on bridges; restate Theorems 14\u201316 with precise scope, and supply the missing gadgets plus completion lemmas (port/hub for \u0394=D; cycles to block near-root bridges; density construction far outside).\\n- For Amb_k, write a full outer-shell rigidification lemma (both \u0394\u2264D and \u0394=D), with degree budgets and a completion lemma. Then formalize the re-rooting template covering and conclude \u201csaturation of nowhere-dense \u21d2 meagre\u201d on a comeagre domain for D\u22653.\\n- Clarify the finite satisfiability in Theorem 4 with a correct finite result or a modified augmentation.\\n\\nSanity checks/examples\\n- D-regular even: the D-regular tree shows 2-way infinite bridges exist; use it to correct Theorem 16\u2019s narrative. No 1-way bridges in any D-regular graph (include the one-line parity proof).\\n- Saturation vs openness: \u201chas a leaf somewhere\u201d is dense and not open; good to showcase why quotient-openness fails.\\n\\nSummary of what is firm\\n- ND root-invariance is settled by a root-free cylinder criterion relying only on saturation and the clopen basis.\\n- The quotient approach must avoid openness claims; rely on cylinders in the rooted space instead.\\n- With corrected gadgetry and explicit completion lemmas, Theorems 14\u201317 can be made rigorous; Theorem 4\u2019s finite step needs repair.\\n- The meagre half is within reach via outer-shell rigidification and re-rooting templates, but requires full details before inclusion in Main Results.\"}",
