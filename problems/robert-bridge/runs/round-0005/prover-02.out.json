  "content": "Ideas\n- Correct a flaw: Amb_k (points allowing a k\u2011step re\u2011root with a globally indistinguishable next neighbor) is not nowhere dense; e.g., the D\u2011regular tree ball lies in Amb_1 and has nonempty interior. So the earlier Amb_k strategy cannot establish meagreness of saturations in general.\n- New route for the meagre half (for bridges): directly show that, for each fixed k, the set of rootings with a bridge within distance \u2264k is nowhere dense by forcing cycles around all k\u2011local edges via a low\u2011degree \u201cmerger network\u201d attached beyond a large outer sphere. This works uniformly for \u0394\u2264D and \u0394=D when D\u22653, and yields meagreness of \u201chas a 2\u2011way infinite bridge\u201d as a countable union over k.\n\nCompletion lemma for \u0394=D\nLemma 1 (ball completion, \u0394=D). Fix D\u22653. Let F be a finite connected graph with a designated root \u03c1 and radius R layers L_0,\u2026,L_R (distances from \u03c1), with \u0394(F)\u2264D. Then there exists a countably infinite connected D\u2011regular graph G with B_R(G,\u03c1)\u2245F.\nProof. For each x\u2208L_R, let q(x)=D\u2212deg_F(x)\u22651 be its deficit. Take a countable family {T_i} of pairwise disjoint infinite D\u2011regular trees. In each T_i delete one vertex z_i, obtaining D \u201cport\u201d vertices of degree D\u22121 in components {C_{i,1},\u2026,C_{i,D}}. Enumerate the multiset of deficits {q(x): x\u2208L_R} as a sequence, and greedily assign to each missing stub a fresh port vertex (across the disjoint {C_{i,j}}), adding an edge from x to that port. Each boundary vertex x gains q(x) neighbors, reaching degree D; each port rises from degree D\u22121 to D. The resulting graph is connected (contains F and each C_{i,j} attached to F) and D\u2011regular. Since new edges emanate only from L_R, the R\u2011ball about \u03c1 remains F. \u220e\n\nNowhere density of k\u2011local bridges (D\u22653)\nProposition 2. Fix D\u22653 and k\u2208\u2115. Let Br_\u2264k be the set of (G,\u03c1)\u2208G_{\u2022,D} that contain a bridge at distance \u2264k from \u03c1. Then Br_\u2264k is nowhere dense in both G_{\u2022,\u2264D} and G_{\u2022,=D}.\nProof. Let G_{\u2022}^{F_0} be a nonempty cylinder of radius r. Choose R\u226br+k and extend F_0 to a finite ball F_1 of radius R by a tree\u2011like expansion: for every vertex y at distance s with r\u2264s<R, add D\u2212deg(y) fresh neighbors at distance s+1 (for \u0394= D: add exactly D\u2212deg(y) neighbors; for \u0394\u2264D: add at most D\u2212deg(y)), and keep edges only between consecutive layers, no intra\u2011layer edges. Thus every x\u2208L_R is a leaf (deg_F1(x)=1). Let E_k be the finite set of edges e of F_1 with both endpoints at distance \u2264k from \u03c1.\nFor each e\u2208E_k, delete e in F_1; since R\u226bk and every layer expands forward, each of the two components meets L_R. Choose a pair of boundary vertices b_e^+,b_e^\u2212\u2208L_R, one from each component. Let B=\u22c3_{e\u2208E_k}{b_e^+,b_e^\u2212}. Build a finite \u201cmerger network\u201d S: a tree whose internal vertices have degree \u22643 and whose leaves are in bijection with B. Place S entirely outside L_R, and join each leaf of S to its corresponding boundary vertex in B. Let F\u2032 be the resulting finite ball of radius R\u2032>R (the minimum radius containing S and its attachments). Degree feasibility: every boundary vertex in B increases degree by 1 (from 1 to 2) within F\u2032; all internal vertices of S have degree \u22643\u2264D. Hence \u0394(F\u2032)\u2264D. Non\u2011emptiness: in \u0394\u2264D, extend F\u2032 arbitrarily further with degree \u2264D by attaching trees to the remaining boundary stubs; in \u0394= D, apply Lemma 1 to complete B_{R\u2032} to a D\u2011regular infinite G.\nNow take any (H,\u03c1)\u2208G_{\u2022}^{F\u2032}. Let e\u2208E_k. In H, the two components of H\u2212e each contain one of b_e^+,b_e^\u2212. The merger tree S yields an H\u2011path between b_e^+ and b_e^\u2212 that avoids e, so e lies on a cycle. Therefore no edge at distance \u2264k is a bridge in H. As this holds for all extensions H of F\u2032, we have G_{\u2022}^{F\u2032}\u2282G_{\u2022}^{F_0}\u2216Br_\u2264k. By the cylinder characterization, Br_\u2264k is nowhere dense. \u220e\n\nMeagreness of 2\u2011way infinite bridges and root\u2011invariance (D\u22653)\nCorollary 3. For D\u22653, the set S_{2w} of rooted graphs whose underlying graph has a 2\u2011way infinite bridge is meagre (but not nowhere dense) in G_{\u2022,D}. Moreover, this meagreness is root\u2011invariant.\nProof. If G has a 2\u2011way infinite bridge, then for each root \u03c1 there exists k with a bridge at distance \u2264k from \u03c1. Hence S_{2w}=\u22c3_{k\u22650} Br_\u2264k. By Proposition 2 each Br_\u2264k is nowhere dense, so S_{2w} is meagre. Root\u2011invariance is immediate since S_{2w} is saturated and the decomposition uses only the k\u2011local condition relative to the root. \u220e\n\nRemarks, examples, and corrections\n- The merger network S avoids high\u2011degree hubs and works uniformly for \u0394\u2264D and \u0394= D provided D\u22653. The D=2 case is exceptional (max degree bound precludes any branching outside), consistent with earlier caveats.\n- This framework immediately recovers Theorem 16 in the notes with explicit degree bookkeeping and a completion argument for the \u0394= D case.\n- Ambiguity sets Amb_k are not small in general: for the D\u2011regular tree T_D, every neighbor of the root yields a global rooted isomorphism, so the cylinder of B_r(T_D) lies in Amb_1 for all r. Thus Amb_k need not be nowhere dense, invalidating that earlier route.\n\nNext steps\n- Extend the merger\u2011network method to other \u201cexistential obstruction\u201d properties P where P at distance \u2264k can be locally destroyed by wiring boundary vertices (e.g., forbidding k\u2011local cut edges or enforcing k\u2011local 2\u2011edge\u2011connectivity). Formalize a general \u201clocal avoidability\u201d criterion: if for every cylinder and k one can refine beyond the outer sphere to forbid P within distance \u2264k in all extensions, then S_P is meagre (as \u22c3_k nowhere dense sets). Apply to additional properties from the notes.\n- Investigate D=2 separately, where the merger network is impossible; classify smallness of bridge\u2011related properties in G_{\u2022,=2} and G_{\u2022,\u22642}.\n- For the general meagre half beyond such P, explore category\u2011preserving selectors on comeagre domains or alternative game\u2011theoretic arguments to bypass the need for Amb_k to be small."
