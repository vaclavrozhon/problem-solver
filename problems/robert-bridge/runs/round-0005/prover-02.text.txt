Ideas
- Correct a flaw: Amb_k (points allowing a k‑step re‑root with a globally indistinguishable next neighbor) is not nowhere dense; e.g., the D‑regular tree ball lies in Amb_1 and has nonempty interior. So the earlier Amb_k strategy cannot establish meagreness of saturations in general.
- New route for the meagre half (for bridges): directly show that, for each fixed k, the set of rootings with a bridge within distance ≤k is nowhere dense by forcing cycles around all k‑local edges via a low‑degree “merger network” attached beyond a large outer sphere. This works uniformly for Δ≤D and Δ=D when D≥3, and yields meagreness of “has a 2‑way infinite bridge” as a countable union over k.

Completion lemma for Δ=D
Lemma 1 (ball completion, Δ=D). Fix D≥3. Let F be a finite connected graph with a designated root ρ and radius R layers L_0,…,L_R (distances from ρ), with Δ(F)≤D. Then there exists a countably infinite connected D‑regular graph G with B_R(G,ρ)≅F.
Proof. For each x∈L_R, let q(x)=D−deg_F(x)≥1 be its deficit. Take a countable family {T_i} of pairwise disjoint infinite D‑regular trees. In each T_i delete one vertex z_i, obtaining D “port” vertices of degree D−1 in components {C_{i,1},…,C_{i,D}}. Enumerate the multiset of deficits {q(x): x∈L_R} as a sequence, and greedily assign to each missing stub a fresh port vertex (across the disjoint {C_{i,j}}), adding an edge from x to that port. Each boundary vertex x gains q(x) neighbors, reaching degree D; each port rises from degree D−1 to D. The resulting graph is connected (contains F and each C_{i,j} attached to F) and D‑regular. Since new edges emanate only from L_R, the R‑ball about ρ remains F. ∎

Nowhere density of k‑local bridges (D≥3)
Proposition 2. Fix D≥3 and k∈ℕ. Let Br_≤k be the set of (G,ρ)∈G_{•,D} that contain a bridge at distance ≤k from ρ. Then Br_≤k is nowhere dense in both G_{•,≤D} and G_{•,=D}.
Proof. Let G_{•}^{F_0} be a nonempty cylinder of radius r. Choose R≫r+k and extend F_0 to a finite ball F_1 of radius R by a tree‑like expansion: for every vertex y at distance s with r≤s<R, add D−deg(y) fresh neighbors at distance s+1 (for Δ= D: add exactly D−deg(y) neighbors; for Δ≤D: add at most D−deg(y)), and keep edges only between consecutive layers, no intra‑layer edges. Thus every x∈L_R is a leaf (deg_F1(x)=1). Let E_k be the finite set of edges e of F_1 with both endpoints at distance ≤k from ρ.
For each e∈E_k, delete e in F_1; since R≫k and every layer expands forward, each of the two components meets L_R. Choose a pair of boundary vertices b_e^+,b_e^−∈L_R, one from each component. Let B=⋃_{e∈E_k}{b_e^+,b_e^−}. Build a finite “merger network” S: a tree whose internal vertices have degree ≤3 and whose leaves are in bijection with B. Place S entirely outside L_R, and join each leaf of S to its corresponding boundary vertex in B. Let F′ be the resulting finite ball of radius R′>R (the minimum radius containing S and its attachments). Degree feasibility: every boundary vertex in B increases degree by 1 (from 1 to 2) within F′; all internal vertices of S have degree ≤3≤D. Hence Δ(F′)≤D. Non‑emptiness: in Δ≤D, extend F′ arbitrarily further with degree ≤D by attaching trees to the remaining boundary stubs; in Δ= D, apply Lemma 1 to complete B_{R′} to a D‑regular infinite G.
Now take any (H,ρ)∈G_{•}^{F′}. Let e∈E_k. In H, the two components of H−e each contain one of b_e^+,b_e^−. The merger tree S yields an H‑path between b_e^+ and b_e^− that avoids e, so e lies on a cycle. Therefore no edge at distance ≤k is a bridge in H. As this holds for all extensions H of F′, we have G_{•}^{F′}⊂G_{•}^{F_0}∖Br_≤k. By the cylinder characterization, Br_≤k is nowhere dense. ∎

Meagreness of 2‑way infinite bridges and root‑invariance (D≥3)
Corollary 3. For D≥3, the set S_{2w} of rooted graphs whose underlying graph has a 2‑way infinite bridge is meagre (but not nowhere dense) in G_{•,D}. Moreover, this meagreness is root‑invariant.
Proof. If G has a 2‑way infinite bridge, then for each root ρ there exists k with a bridge at distance ≤k from ρ. Hence S_{2w}=⋃_{k≥0} Br_≤k. By Proposition 2 each Br_≤k is nowhere dense, so S_{2w} is meagre. Root‑invariance is immediate since S_{2w} is saturated and the decomposition uses only the k‑local condition relative to the root. ∎

Remarks, examples, and corrections
- The merger network S avoids high‑degree hubs and works uniformly for Δ≤D and Δ= D provided D≥3. The D=2 case is exceptional (max degree bound precludes any branching outside), consistent with earlier caveats.
- This framework immediately recovers Theorem 16 in the notes with explicit degree bookkeeping and a completion argument for the Δ= D case.
- Ambiguity sets Amb_k are not small in general: for the D‑regular tree T_D, every neighbor of the root yields a global rooted isomorphism, so the cylinder of B_r(T_D) lies in Amb_1 for all r. Thus Amb_k need not be nowhere dense, invalidating that earlier route.

Next steps
- Extend the merger‑network method to other “existential obstruction” properties P where P at distance ≤k can be locally destroyed by wiring boundary vertices (e.g., forbidding k‑local cut edges or enforcing k‑local 2‑edge‑connectivity). Formalize a general “local avoidability” criterion: if for every cylinder and k one can refine beyond the outer sphere to forbid P within distance ≤k in all extensions, then S_P is meagre (as ⋃_k nowhere dense sets). Apply to additional properties from the notes.
- Investigate D=2 separately, where the merger network is impossible; classify smallness of bridge‑related properties in G_{•,=2} and G_{•,≤2}.
- For the general meagre half beyond such P, explore category‑preserving selectors on comeagre domains or alternative game‑theoretic arguments to bypass the need for Amb_k to be small.
