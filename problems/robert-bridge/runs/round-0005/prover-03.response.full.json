That's a good distinction! Regarding their Theorem 16, they claim that there's a 2-way infinite bridge at distance k, which is nowhere dense.

However, there are technical inaccuracies in Section 2 (metric equivalences, cylinder nonemptiness) that should be corrected to avoid later misuse.\\n- The proof sketches for Theorems 14\u201317 need substantial strengthening. In particular, Theorem 14\u2019s \u201cattach a leaf\u201d does not force a bridge in all extensions; Theorem 17 contains a false parity claim.\\n- Theorem 4 (weak 6\u2011flow without 1\u2011way infinite bridges) appears false as stated; the infinite d\u2011regular tree (d\u22653) is a counterexample. A corrected version should assume \u201cno bridges at all.\u201d\\n- For the meagre half of the conjecture, quotient\u2011space arguments remain invalid; a local re\u2011rooting homeomorphism approach on refined cylinders is the right direction, but needs explicit gadgets and a comeagre coverage lemma.\\n\\n1) Metric and topology: corrections and proofs\\nA) Off\u2011by\u2011one in the metric equivalence. With R=\\\\sup{ r\u2208\u2115 : B_r(G,\u03c1)\u2245B_r(H,\u03c3) } and d_\\\\bullet=2^{\u2212R}, the correct relationships are:\\n- B_r(G,\u03c1)\u2245B_r(H,\u03c3) \u21d4 d_\\\\bullet((G,\u03c1),(H,\u03c3)) \u2264 2^{\u2212r}.\\n- For all r and 0<\u03b5\u22642^{\u2212(r+1)}: U_{2^{\u2212r}+\u03b5}((G,\u03c1)) = \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^{B_r(G,\u03c1)}.\\nProof. If B_r agrees then R\u2265r, so d\u22642^{\u2212r}<2^{\u2212r}+\u03b5. Conversely, if d<2^{\u2212r}+\u03b5\u22642^{\u2212r}+2^{\u2212(r+1)}<2^{\u2212r+1}, then d=2^{\u2212q} with q\u2265r, hence B_r agrees.\\nB) Cylinders are clopen. \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^F is open by (A) and closed since its complement is a finite union of cylinders at radius r that disagree with F.\\nC) Nonemptiness under degree constraints.\\n- \u2264D: \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^F\u2229\\\\mathbf{G}_{\\\\bullet,\u2264D}\u2260\u2205 iff some vertex at distance exactly r has deg_F< D. Necessity: otherwise any extension changes B_r. Sufficiency: attach an infinite \u2264D tree at a boundary stub.\\n- =D: \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^F\u2229\\\\mathbf{G}_{\\\\bullet,=D}\u2260\u2205 iff there exists a boundary vertex at distance r with deg_F< D (no further restriction is necessary). Sufficiency: saturate all vertices at distance <r internally to degree D by adding neighbors at distance r+1, and attach disjoint D\u2011regular trees at boundary deficits.\\nD) Nowhere\u2011dense characterization. Replace \u201c\u2286 \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^F \\\\setminus S\u201d by the correct \u201c\u2286 \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^F \\\\setminus \\\\overline{S}\u201d. Since cylinders form a base of clopen sets, this is equivalent to Int(\\\\overline{S})=\u2205.\\nE) Baire property. Both \\\\mathbf{G}_{\\\\bullet,\u2264D} and \\\\mathbf{G}_{\\\\bullet,=D} are compact in the local topology (Aldous\u2013Lyons, 2007), hence Baire; thus \u201cnot meagre\u201d holds for \\\\mathbf{G}_{\\\\bullet,D}.\\n\\n2) Root\u2011invariance of nowhere density (ND) is settled\\nProposition. For unrooted P, S_P is saturated; for any saturated S, \\\\overline{S} and Int(\\\\overline{S}) are saturated. Hence ND of S_P is root\u2011invariant.\\nProof. Given (G,\u03c1)\u2208\\\\overline{S} and u\u2208V(G), for each t choose r\u2265t+dist(\u03c1,u) and (H_r,\u03c3_r)\u2208S with B_r(H_r,\u03c3_r)\u2245B_r(G,\u03c1). Transport the root along the isomorphism to u; saturation gives (H_r,u_r)\u2208S and B_t(H_r,u_r)\u2245B_t(G,u), so (G,u)\u2208\\\\overline{S}. Interior is a union of cylinders, hence saturated. ND is Int(\\\\overline{S_P})=\u2205, which is root\u2011free.\\nEquivalent cylinder criterion (preferred). S_P is ND iff for every rooted r\u2011ball F there exists an r\u2032\u2011ball F\u2032 extending F with \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^{F\u2032}\u2229S_P=\u2205.\\n\\n3) Major flaw: Theorem 4 is false as stated\\nCounterexample. Let T be the infinite d\u2011regular tree with d\u22653. T is locally finite and every bridge is 2\u2011way infinite (no 1\u2011way infinite bridge). Suppose \u03c6: E(T)\u2192A is a weak A\u2011flow (Kirchhoff at vertices) for any abelian group A. Pick a leaf in a finite truncation and argue by elimination: at any degree\u20111 vertex v (in the finite component obtained by deleting faraway edges), Kirchhoff forces \u03c6 on its incident edge to be 0; iterating shows \u03c6\u22610 on E(T). Equivalently, the cycle space of a tree is trivial, so the only circulation is zero. Thus no nowhere\u2011zero weak flow exists on T. Conclusion: \u201cno 1\u2011way infinite bridge\u201d does not suffice.\\nCorrection. A valid statement is: If G is countable, locally finite, and bridgeless (every edge lies on a cycle), then G admits a nowhere\u2011zero weak 6\u2011flow. Sketch route: For each finite set of vertices U, contract every component of G\u2212U to a single vertex; the resulting finite graph is bridgeless; apply Seymour\u2019s 6\u2011flow theorem to obtain a nowhere\u2011zero 6\u2011flow on the minor; lift it to a weak 6\u2011flow on G that satisfies Kirchhoff\u2019s law on U. Then compactness yields a global weak 6\u2011flow. Details should be written carefully; importantly, \u201cbridgeless\u201d is necessary here.\\n\\n4) Theorem 14 (bridgeless nowhere dense): strengthen gadgets\\nIssue. In \u2264D, \u201cattach a leaf\u201d is insufficient: later extensions can create a cycle through the leaf, killing the bridge.\\nFix (\u2264D). Refine any cylinder \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^F to F\u2032 that contains a finite core C such that: all vertices of C at distance <R are saturated to degree D within F\u2032; exactly one boundary vertex z of C lies at distance R with deg_{F\u2032}(z)=1 (its neighbor w\u2208C); all other boundary vertices of F\u2032 have degree D. In any extension, the only exit from C is through z, hence the edge wz is a 1\u2011way infinite bridge. Thus bridgeless graphs form a nowhere dense set.\\nFix (=D, odd D). Let S(F\u2032)=\u2211_{v\u2208V(B_{R}(F\u2032))}(D\u2212deg_{F\u2032}(v)) be the number of external half\u2011edges. By adding internal edges in the new layer, pair deficits to force S(F\u2032)=1 (possible for odd D by parity: S(F\u2032)\u2261D|V|\u22122|E|\u2261|V| (mod 2)). Place the unique deficit at z as above; then in any D\u2011regular extension a single external edge attaches at z, forcing a 1\u2011way infinite bridge. Parity forbids S(F\u2032)=1 for even D, explaining the restriction.\\n\\n5) Theorem 15 (no cut vertex nowhere dense): provide a concrete gadget\\nConstruct F\u2032 with a vertex v and two lobes L_1,L_2 meeting only at v such that:\\n- All vertices of L_2 on the boundary are degree\u2011D within F\u2032 (no external attachments through L_2).\\n- All boundary deficits of F\u2032 (allowing infinite continuation) lie in L_1.\\nThen any extension connects the outside only through L_1, so any path from outside to L_2 goes through v; v is a cut vertex in every extension. Provide explicit degree bookkeeping for \u2264D and for =D (even D) to ensure feasibility.\\n\\n6) Theorem 16 (2\u2011way infinite bridge is meagre but dense)\\n- Meagre: For fixed k, let P_k be: \u201cthere exists a 2\u2011way infinite bridge at distance \u2264k from the root.\u201d Given \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^F, refine to F\u2032 so that every edge e within distance \u2264k lies on a triangle in F\u2032: route from each endpoint to two boundary vertices with spare capacity (guaranteed by 1C), and connect them outside the original ball to form a bypass path, turning e into part of a cycle. Thus P_k is nowhere dense. Hence \u22c3_k P_k (the set of graphs with a 2\u2011way infinite bridge) is meagre.\\n- Dense (so not nowhere dense): Given any \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^F, extend far outside B_r to attach two disjoint infinite trees T_1,T_2 and connect them by a single edge e; e is a 2\u2011way infinite bridge in any extension. Hence the set is dense. Conclude: meagre but not nowhere dense.\\n\\n7) Theorem 17 (edge\u2011chromatic number): fix parity error\\nThe claim \u201cremoving an edge preserves \u03c7\u2032=D+1 by parity\u201d is false (e.g., K_3\u2212e has \u03c7\u2032=2). Correct approach: For each D\u22653, fix a finite D\u2011regular class\u20112 graph H (even D: K_{D+1}; odd D: snarks for D=3 and known class\u20112 families for higher odd D). Given any cylinder, refine to embed H strictly inside the ball while meeting degree budgets; any extension contains H, so \u03c7\u2032\u2265\u03c7\u2032(H)=D+1. Therefore {\u03c7\u2032=D} is nowhere dense. Add references for existence of H in odd D (e.g., Tashkinov trees, critical class\u20112 graphs).\\n\\n8) Quotient caveat: provide a concrete non\u2011openness example\\nLet C be the cylinder \u201croot has degree 1.\u201d Its saturation Sat(C) is \u201cgraph has a degree\u20111 vertex somewhere,\u201d which equals \u22c3_{k\u22650} A_k where A_k says \u201cthere is a degree\u20111 vertex within distance \u2264k of the root.\u201d Each A_k is open, so Sat(C) is F_\u03c3 but not open in general. Thus the forget\u2011the\u2011root quotient map does not send cylinders to open sets; avoid quotient\u2011openness arguments for meagreness.\\n\\n9) Local re\u2011rooting homeomorphisms (meagre root\u2011invariance program)\\nLemma (marker\u2011based local re\u2011rooting). Given an r\u2011ball F and u\u2208V(F), there exists an extension F_mark (radius r\u2032\u2265r) and cylinders U=\\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^{F_\\\\mathrm{mark}}, V=\\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^{F_\\\\mathrm{mark}[u]} such that re\u2011rooting at the uniquely marked copy of u defines a homeomorphism U\u2192V.\\nSketch. Extend along a chosen geodesic from the root to u and place a unique \u201cbeacon\u201d tree on the boundary of that geodesic; uniqueness pins down u (by a fixed offset). Degree constraints: in \u2264D use a boundary stub; in =D (odd D) first enforce a unique external stub by parity and place the beacon there. This yields partial homeomorphisms implementing finite re\u2011rootings on refined cylinders. Meagreness is preserved under such homeomorphisms. Completing meagre root\u2011invariance requires covering a comeagre set by countably many such domains; this is the remaining technical task.\\n\\nActionable next steps\\n- Fix Section 2 with items 1A\u20131E (include short proofs in proofs.md).\\n- Replace Theorem 4 by the bridgeless version (or provide a new finite\u2011satisfiability argument, otherwise retract as false; include the tree counterexample).\\n- Strengthen Theorems 14\u201317 with the concrete gadgets above; add degree bookkeeping and parity checks.\\n- Develop the marker\u2011based re\u2011rooting cover on a comeagre domain to advance the meagre half of the conjecture (D\u22653; treat D=2 separately).\\n\"}",
