  "summary_md": "Last round: the nowhere\u2011density half of the conjecture was settled. Main tools: (i) if S is saturated then cl(S) and Int(cl(S)) are saturated (proved by large\u2011ball re\u2011rooting), and (ii) an equivalent root\u2011free cylinder criterion: S_P is nowhere dense iff every rooted r\u2011ball F admits an extension F' whose cylinder is disjoint from S_P. It was observed that the forget\u2011the\u2011root quotient need not be open, so meagreness cannot be pushed through that quotient naively. The meagre case was reduced to an Amb_k strategy: for a nowhere\u2011dense N, Sat_k(N) is covered by countably many homeomorphic images of N plus an ambiguity set Amb_k; the plan is to prove Amb_k meagre via degree\u2011preserving marker gadgets and a boundary\u2011hub/beacon construction (separate treatments for \u0394\u2264D and \u0394=D, with D=2 exceptional). Concrete proposition: for D\u22653, \u201cbridge within distance \u2264k\u201d is nowhere dense, hence \u201chas a 2\u2011way infinite bridge\u201d is meagre but dense. Correction noted: the weak 6\u2011flow claim needs bridgelessness. Citations: Current Proofs; papers/paper1.txt.",
