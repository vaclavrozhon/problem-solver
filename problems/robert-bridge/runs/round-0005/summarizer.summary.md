Last round: the nowhere‑density half of the conjecture was settled. Main tools: (i) if S is saturated then cl(S) and Int(cl(S)) are saturated (proved by large‑ball re‑rooting), and (ii) an equivalent root‑free cylinder criterion: S_P is nowhere dense iff every rooted r‑ball F admits an extension F' whose cylinder is disjoint from S_P. It was observed that the forget‑the‑root quotient need not be open, so meagreness cannot be pushed through that quotient naively. The meagre case was reduced to an Amb_k strategy: for a nowhere‑dense N, Sat_k(N) is covered by countably many homeomorphic images of N plus an ambiguity set Amb_k; the plan is to prove Amb_k meagre via degree‑preserving marker gadgets and a boundary‑hub/beacon construction (separate treatments for Δ≤D and Δ=D, with D=2 exceptional). Concrete proposition: for D≥3, “bridge within distance ≤k” is nowhere dense, hence “has a 2‑way infinite bridge” is meagre but dense. Correction noted: the weak 6‑flow claim needs bridgelessness.
