  "feedback_md": "Progress: The nowhere-dense (ND) half is now correctly handled via the clopen-cylinder refinement criterion. The Current Output states a root-free characterization for S_P that is valid and avoids unnecessary claims about Int(cl(S)). Good.\n\nMain issues and fixes:\n- Quotient openness: Prover 1 still relies on \u03c0(C) being open. This is false for the forget-the-root quotient in the rooted local topology; the saturation of a cylinder is typically F_sigma, not open. Provide a concrete counterexample (\u201croot has degree 1\u201d \u2192 \u201chas a leaf somewhere\u201d) and avoid quotient-based openness for both ND and meagreness.\n- Ambiguity sets: The earlier plan to show Bad_{m,\u2113} or Amb_k are small fails in general (e.g., D-regular trees place entire cylinders in Amb_1). Prover 2 correctly retracts this and proposes a direct ND proof for k-local bridges via a merger network beyond a large outer sphere. This is a sound direction.\n- Metric facts: Off-by-one in the equivalence d<2^{-r}\u21d4B_r agrees must be fixed everywhere to prevent radius slippage in cylinder arguments (P3\u2019s correction is right).\n- Theorem 4: As stated (no 1-way infinite bridges \u21d2 weak 6-flow) is false; the infinite D-regular tree (D\u22653) has no weak nowhere-zero flow. A correct version should assume bridgelessness. Retract or restate with a precise finite satisfiability argument.\n- Bridges gadgets: The \u201cattach a leaf\u201d alone does not force a bridge in all completions for \u2264D. You must saturate interior degrees (to D) within a finite core and leave a unique external port to force a cut-edge in every completion (for \u2264D and for =D with odd D; even-D regular forbids 1-way bridges by parity). P3 describes the right shape; full bookkeeping is needed.\n- 2-way bridges: Prover 2\u2019s rigorous scheme for: (i) Br_\u2264k nowhere dense (via a merger network), and (ii) union over k meagre and dense, is correct for D\u22653. This also settles root-invariance of meagreness for this specific P since S_P is saturated and is a countable union of k-local ND sets. Please integrate this with a \u0394=D completion lemma that preserves the inner ball.\n\nConcrete next steps:\n1) Finalize and write the \u0394=D completion lemma (finish degrees and connectivity) and the k-local bridge ND proof with full radius and degree bookkeeping (we supply a cleaned proof in proofs.md). Then add the corollary that \u201chas a 2-way infinite bridge\u201d is meagre (not ND) for D\u22653.\n2) Remove quotient-openness claims; add the non-openness example to notes.\n3) Correct parity/scope statements for bridges; ensure Theorems 14\u201316 reflect that even D-regular graphs admit 2-way bridges but not 1-way bridges.\n4) Either retract Theorem 4 or restate with \u201cbridgeless\u201d and supply a correct compactness/finite satisfiability argument.\n5) Keep the ND root-invariance theorem and cylinder toolkit as the main general result. Broader meagre root-invariance remains open; continue with local re-rooting on comeagre domains if feasible.\n",

No use of Int(cl(S)) being saturated is needed.\n- Quotient caveat: The saturation of a cylinder need not be open (e.g., the cylinder \u201croot has degree 1\u201d saturates to \u201chas a leaf somewhere,\u201d an F_sigma but not open set). Thus forget-the-root quotient arguments that require \u03c0(C) to be open are invalid in this topology.\n- Theorem 4 status: As stated (no 1-way infinite bridges \u21d2 weak 6-flow) it is false; the infinite D-regular tree (D\u22653) has no nonzero weak flow. A correct direction requires assuming bridgelessness.\n- Bridges: Even D-regular graphs admit 2-way infinite bridges (regular tree example) but forbid 1-way bridges by parity; odd D admits 1-way bridges.\n\nMeagre result for 2-way bridges (D\u22653)\n- For each k, let Br_\u2264k be rootings with a bridge within distance \u2264k of the root. Given any nonempty cylinder B_r(G,\u03c1), pick R\u226br+k and build a layered refinement so that from each edge e within distance \u2264k one can route internally to two distinct boundary vertices; then, beyond the outer sphere, add a finite merger network joining those boundary pairs. In every completion, each such e lies on a cycle. Hence Br_\u2264k is nowhere dense. The union over k is meagre.\n- Density: Inside any cylinder, we can complete to an infinite graph and far outside attach an infinite component by a single edge to the existing infinite part. This produces a 2-way infinite bridge. Thus the property is meagre but not nowhere dense. Root-invariance follows since the set is saturated.\n\n\u0394=D completion (sketch): If all vertices at distance <R have degree D in the refined ball and at least one boundary vertex has spare degree, then there exists a D-regular infinite extension preserving the R-ball (see proofs). This supports the \u0394=D case of the merger construction.\n\nOpen directions\n- General meagre root-invariance remains open. Continue with partial homeomorphisms (marker-based re-rooting) on a comeagre domain, or isolate broader classes P where k-local avoidance suffices."

    "content": "Lemma A (\u0394=D ball completion). Let D\u22653 and let F be a finite rooted graph of radius R with root \u03c1. Assume (i) every vertex v with dist_F(\u03c1,v)<R has deg_F(v)=D; and (ii) at least one vertex x in the outer layer L_R has deg_F(x)<D. Then there exists a countably infinite connected D-regular graph G with B_R(G,\u03c1)\u2245F.\nProof. For each x\u2208L_R, let q(x)=D\u2212deg_F(x)\u22650 and s=\u2211_{x\u2208L_R}q(x)\u22651. Build an external reservoir as follows. Take a single infinite D-regular tree T, and delete a countable family M={e_i=u_i v_i : i\u2208\u2115} of pairwise edge-disjoint edges. In the resulting graph T\u2212M, the set U={u_i,v_i : i\u2208\u2115} consists of vertices of degree D\u22121; all other vertices retain degree D. Choose distinct w_1,\u2026,w_s\u2208U, and partition {w_1,\u2026,w_s} into subsets of sizes {q(x)} indexed by x\u2208L_R. Form G_0 by taking the disjoint union of F and T\u2212M and, for each x\u2208L_R, adding edges from x to its assigned q(x) vertices in U. Now every x\u2208L_R attains degree D; each chosen w_j\u2208U attains degree D. The remaining vertices in U (still countably many) have degree D\u22121. Enumerate the connected components of T\u2212M and select one remaining degree-(D\u22121) vertex from each component; pair these selected vertices along a bi-infinite chain by adding edges between consecutive ones, and pair all other remaining degree-(D\u22121) vertices arbitrarily in disjoint edges. This yields a graph O in which all vertices have degree D and O is connected. Let G be the union of F and O with the attachment edges added above. Then G is connected and D-regular. Since all new neighbors of vertices at distance <R lie outside L_R, B_R(G,\u03c1)=F. \u220e\n\nProposition B (k-local bridges are nowhere dense for D\u22653). Fix D\u22653 and k\u2208\u2115. Let Br_\u2264k be the set of rooted graphs (G,\u03c1) in G_{\u2022,\u2264D} or G_{\u2022,=D} that have a bridge at distance \u2264k from \u03c1. Then Br_\u2264k is nowhere dense.\nProof. Let C(F_0) be a nonempty cylinder of radius r. Choose R\u226br+k. Extend F_0 to a layered finite ball F_1 of radius R by adding new layers r+1,\u2026,R so that: (a) all vertices at distance <R have degree \u2264D and, in the \u0394=D case, exactly D; (b) every vertex in the outer layer L_R has degree 1 (only the back-edge to L_{R\u22121}). Let E_k be the finite set of edges e of F_1 whose endpoints lie at distance \u2264k from \u03c1.\nFor each e=ab\u2208E_k, choose two internally vertex-disjoint a\u2192L_R and b\u2192L_R paths in F_1 that avoid e (possible since between r and R we can allocate disjoint forward branches; choose R large enough to separate these finitely many requirements). Let their endpoints in L_R be denoted b_e^+ and b_e^\u2212, with all these endpoints distinct across different e. Outside L_R, build a finite merger tree S whose leaves are in bijection with the set B={b_e^+,b_e^\u2212: e\u2208E_k}, and join each such leaf to its corresponding boundary vertex in L_R. Let F\u2032 be the resulting finite ball of radius R\u2032>R (add only edges and vertices beyond L_R). In the \u0394= D case, all vertices at distance <R already have degree D; in the \u0394\u2264D case, all degrees remain \u2264D; S can be chosen with maximum degree 3\u2264D. By construction, for any completion H of F\u2032 (\u0394\u2264D or, using Lemma A, \u0394=D) and any e\u2208E_k, there is an H-path from b_e^+ to b_e^\u2212 that avoids e, so e lies on a cycle. Thus no edge within distance \u2264k of \u03c1 is a bridge in any completion of F\u2032, i.e., C(F\u2032)\u2286C(F_0)\\Br_\u2264k. Therefore Br_\u2264k is nowhere dense. \u220e\n\nCorollary C (2-way infinite bridges are meagre but not nowhere dense for D\u22653). Let S_{2w} be the set of rootings whose underlying graph has a 2-way infinite bridge. Then S_{2w} is meagre and dense in G_{\u2022,\u2264D} and in G_{\u2022,=D} for D\u22653.\nProof. Write S_{2w}=\u22c3_{k\u22650} Br_\u2264k; by Proposition B each Br_\u2264k is nowhere dense, hence S_{2w} is meagre. For density, given any cylinder C(F_0), extend beyond a large radius to obtain an infinite completion A; attach an additional infinite tree T disjoint from A and join A to T by a single edge e whose endpoints lie outside the prescribed ball. Then e is a 2-way infinite bridge in the resulting completion, which lies in C(F_0). This works under \u0394\u2264D; for \u0394=D, first ensure (by extending the ball) two designated boundary vertices have spare degree and attach the two infinite D-regular trees at those vertices before adding e; Lemma A provides D-regular completions. Hence S_{2w} is dense. \u220e"
