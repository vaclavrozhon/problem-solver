=== SYSTEM ===
You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md, proofs.md, and output.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers
- notes.md (informal progress & exploratory work so far)
- proofs.md (rigorous proofs & detailed mathematics so far)
- output.md (main results found so far)

**Three-tier file system guidelines**:
- **notes.md**: Readable, log of exploratory work, intuitions, failed attempts, ideas. Prefer appending. Replace only if old notes are clearly misleading. It should be self-contained: In particular, reading it should make sense without knowing the output of provers in past rounds. 

- **proofs.md**: Complete rigorous mathematical proofs with full details. Think twice before adding anything. Contains proven lemmas, theorems, and detailed derivations. Only add mathematically verified content here.
- **output.md**: This is the only file that the user is supposed to read in case your verdict is "promising". It has to be self-contained. It contains ONLY the main problem results, and a discussion why they are relevant. It is extremely selective. Think twice before promoting proofs from proofs.md to output.md. Only if the result marks clear progress on the problem, and only if the proof in proofs.md has been thoroughly vetted by provers and you, it can join output.md. Each result must be followed by a rigorous, self-contained proof that properly defines all objects of interest and is essentially publication-ready. 

Tasks:
1) Audit rigor: identify unjustified steps, false statements, missing lemmas; produce minimal counterexamples.
2) Triage value: separate genuine progress from noise.

## Setting

- Fix an integer \(D \ge 2\).
- Let \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) be the space of **countably infinite, connected, rooted graphs** \((G,\rho)\).
- For \((G,\rho) \in \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) and \(r \in \mathbb{N}\), let \(B_r(G,\rho)\) denote the rooted (closed) ball of radius \(r\) about \(\rho\).
- Equip \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) with the **local (Benjamini–Schramm) metric** \(d_\bullet\) given by
  \[
  d_\bullet\big((G,\rho),(H,\sigma)\big)=2^{-R},
  \qquad
  R=\sup\{r\in\mathbb{N} : B_r(G,\rho)\cong B_r(H,\sigma)\}.
  \]
  (Equivalently, \(d_\bullet((G,\rho),(H,\sigma))<2^{-r}\) iff \(B_r(G,\rho)\cong B_r(H,\sigma)\).)
- Degree‑constrained subspaces:
  - \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\): all rooted graphs with \(\Delta(G)\le D\).
  - \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,= D}\): all rooted graphs with \(\Delta(G)= D\).
  We write \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for either of these when the distinction is unimportant.
- A subset \(S\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) is **nowhere dense** if the interior of \(\overline{S}\) is empty. A set is **meagre** (first category) if it is a countable union of nowhere dense sets; its complement is **comeagre**. A property is called **typical** if the corresponding set is comeagre.
- An edge \(e\) of an (unrooted) graph \(G\) is a **bridge** if \(G-e\) has more connected components than \(G\). A bridge is **2‑way infinite** if both components are infinite and **1‑way infinite** otherwise.

# Research Notes



Conjecture (Root‑invariance of smallness). For an unrooted property P and S_P={ (G,\rho) in G_{\bullet,D} : G has P }, does the nowhere‑dense/meagre status of S_P depend on root choices?

Agreed notions
- Saturated sets: S is saturated if (G,\rho) in S implies (G,u) in S for every vertex u of G. For unrooted P, S_P is saturated.
- Cylinders form a clopen base in the local topology, hence nowhere density can be witnessed by refining cylinders.

Key lemma (settled). If S is saturated, then cl(S) and Int(cl(S)) are saturated. Sketch: For (G,\rho) in cl(S) and u in V(G), for each t pick r≫dist(\rho,u)+t and (H_r,\sigma_r) in S with B_r matching at the root; transport the root to the image of u and use saturation to see (H_r,u_r) in S with B_t(H_r,u_r)≅B_t(G,u). Thus (G,u) in cl(S). Interior of a saturated set is saturated because open sets are unions of cylinders and re‑rooting preserves membership.

Consequence (nowhere density is root‑invariant). S is nowhere dense iff Int(cl(S))=\emptyset. For saturated S this condition is root‑free; applied to S_P it proves the ND half of the conjecture.

Caveat on quotients. Let π: G_{\bullet,D}→U_q be the quotient by forgetting the root. In general, π maps open cylinders to sets whose preimages are the saturations of those cylinders, which need not be open; π(C) need not be open. Thus arguments that rely on π being open are invalid. Any quotient‑based comparison must work with saturated open sets only, or with a selector on a comeagre domain.

Meagre part: current route and plan. Define Good_∞ (comeagre local rigidity): around the root and finitely many steps, distinct neighbors are eventually distinguishable. Using (degree‑preserving) markers, each Bad_{m,\ell} should be nowhere dense; this yields a comeagre domain on which countably many partial re‑rooting homeomorphisms generate all finite re‑rootings. Then: the saturation of a nowhere‑dense set is meagre (countable union of homeomorphic images of a nowhere‑dense set plus a meagre exceptional set). This would imply meagreness for many S_P constructed as saturations of root‑local nowhere‑dense witnesses. Completing this requires explicit marker gadgets in both Δ≤D and Δ= D (odd/even cases).

Open items
- Finish the Good_∞ construction with uniform markers in Δ= D and write the proof that each Bad_{m,\ell} is nowhere dense.
- Either produce a Borel/continuous selector on a comeagre domain (unique marked root) to compare meagreness between U_q and the rooted space, or construct a counterexample showing full meagre equivalence can fail without extra structure.
- Optional: record the metric off‑by‑one correction and the safe non‑emptiness criterion for cylinders (≤D is straightforward).

Clarification: Nowhere-density root-invariance does not require that Int(cl(S)) be saturated. For an unrooted property P, S_P is saturated and the cylinder criterion yields a root-free formulation: S_P is nowhere dense iff for every rooted r-ball F there is an extension F′ such that every D-bounded connected graph containing a copy of F′ (at some vertex) fails P. This avoids any subtlety about interiors of closures.

Caveat on quotients: The forget-the-root quotient map π need not send cylinders to open sets in the quotient of the rooted topology; saturations of cylinders are typically not open. Thus arguments that rely on π being open (or category-preserving) are invalid. Work directly with the rooted clopen cylinder basis.

Meagre part plan update: Replace the previous “Bad_{m,ℓ} is nowhere dense” approach (false in general) by the Amb_k reduction: for nowhere-dense N, Sat_k(N) is covered by countably many homeomorphic images of N plus the ambiguity set Amb_k (points where some step of re-rooting is not uniquely determined). If we can show each Amb_k is meagre via intrinsic markers (degree-preserving gadgets in ≤D and =D), then Sat(N) is meagre. Action items: design explicit port/marker gadgets and prove the Amb_k meagreness. Also, fix parity/scope issues for regular even D (no bridges) in related theorems.

Meagre part: boundary-hub beacon scheme (D≥3)
- Goal: Show Amb_k (exists w within distance ≤k with two neighbors u≠v s.t. (G,u)≅(G,v)) is nowhere dense. This, with the re-rooting template covering, implies: saturation of a nowhere-dense set is meagre.
- Constraint: Refining a cylinder C(F) must preserve B_r(F). Hence no new edges may be added at vertices with dist<r from the root. All modifications must occur at the outer sphere (dist=r) or beyond.
- Plan (Δ≤D): Given nonempty C(F), pick a boundary vertex b with deg_F(b)<D. Attach a finite hub H beyond b using only one additional edge at b. For each controlled pair (w,x) with dist(root,w)≤k and x∈N_F(w): choose an existing path inside F from x to b (no new edges inside B_r), and reserve a distinct branch in H ending at a beacon B_i (pairwise non-isomorphic) at a chosen depth L(w,x). Choose indices/depths so that for any neighbors u,v of w, the multisets of (beacon type, distance from root at u) and at v differ; then (G,u)≇(G,v) in any completion. Degree budgets are respected since only b gains one new incident edge; all other attachments occur in the newly added hub.
- Plan (Δ=D): First choose a larger radius R≫r and build F′ so that every vertex at dist< R has degree D within F′, and at least one vertex on the outer sphere dist=R has spare capacity (leave one stub). Attach the hub at that outer sphere vertex and proceed as above. Only outer sphere vertices get new edges; hence any D-regular completion that preserves B_R=F′ exists (attach the remaining stubs outside), and Amb_k is avoided within C(F′).
- Tasks: (i) Formalize the choice of indices/depths to guarantee distinct neighbor-root signature multisets at u vs v; (ii) Write explicit degree bookkeeping and a completion lemma for Δ=D ensuring B_R remains fixed; (iii) Treat D=2 separately (Amb_1 is large; the above fails).

Corrections and caveats
- ND root-invariance: use the cylinder criterion (root-free) only; Int(cl(S)) saturation is unnecessary. 
- Quotients: Saturations of cylinders are typically not open; avoid quotient-openness arguments.
- Bridges/cuts: Replace naive ‘attach a leaf’ forcing by port/hub gadgets that ensure unique external connections in all completions; check parity (no 1-way bridges in any D-regular graph).

# Main Results

Theorem (Root-invariance of nowhere density). Fix D≥2. Let P be any property of unrooted graphs and let S_P={ (G,\rho) in G_{\bullet,D} : G has P }. Then S_P is nowhere dense in (G_{\bullet,D},d_\bullet) if and only if the following equivalent, root-free condition holds:
For every rooted r-ball F there exists an extension r′-ball F′ with G_{\bullet}^{F′}⊆G_{\bullet}^{F} such that for every D-bounded connected graph H and vertex v with B_{r′}(H,v)≅F′, the unrooted graph H does not have P.
In particular, whether S_P is nowhere dense does not depend on how graphs are rooted.

Proof. Cylinders G_{\bullet}^{F} form a clopen base of the local topology. If S_P is nowhere dense, then for each r-ball F there exists a subcylinder G_{\bullet}^{F′}⊆G_{\bullet}^{F} with G_{\bullet}^{F′}∩S_P=\emptyset. Hence any (H,v) whose r′-ball equals F′ lies outside S_P, so H fails P. Conversely, if such F′ exists for each F, then every nonempty cylinder contains a subcylinder disjoint from S_P, which is equivalent to S_P being nowhere dense. This criterion refers only to P and D, not to a chosen root, establishing root-invariance. ∎

Note. The meagre part of the conjecture remains open in full generality. A promising route proceeds via covering the re-root saturations of nowhere-dense sets by countably many homeomorphic images plus a small ambiguity set; proving that the ambiguity set is meagre (via degree-preserving marker gadgets) would settle meagre root-invariance for broad classes of properties.

Ideas and overall assessment
- The nowhere-dense (ND) half of the conjecture is in good shape if you rely solely on the clopen cylinder basis and the standard ND-by-refinement criterion. Your Current Output already states a correct, root-free criterion for S_P being ND. Keep this and avoid extraneous claims about Int(cl(S)).
- The meagre half remains unsettled. The “ambiguity sets Amb_k” route could work, but the present sketch contains a key flaw (see below) and needs a careful, degree-aware, outer-shell rigidification that respects cylinders.

Specific flaws and corrections
1) Off-by-one in the metric equivalence.
- You state “d_•((G,ρ),(H,σ)) < 2^{-r} iff B_r(G,ρ)≅B_r(H,σ)”. Correct is: d_• ≤ 2^{-r} iff B_r agrees; and d_• < 2^{-r} iff B_{r+1} agrees. Please fix all uses to avoid later mismatches in radii.

2) “Int(cl(S)) is saturated” is unproven and unnecessary.
- Your sketch “open sets are unions of cylinders and re-rooting preserves membership” is invalid: re-rooting does not preserve membership in a given cylinder. Do not use this claim. What you need and can prove rigorously is: closure of a saturated set is saturated.
- Lemma (closure of saturated is saturated). If S⊆G_{\bullet,D} is saturated and (G,ρ)∈cl(S), then for any u∈V(G) and t∈N there exists r≫dist(ρ,u)+t and (H_r,σ_r)∈S with B_r(H_r,σ_r)≅B_r(G,ρ); let u_r be the image of u; then (H_r,u_r)∈S (by saturation) and B_t(H_r,u_r)≅B_t(G,u), hence (G,u)∈cl(S).
- Consequence: The cylinder refinement criterion yields a root-free ND characterization for S_P (already in your Current Output). No further saturation of Int(cl(S)) is needed.

3) Saturations of cylinders are not open; quotient arguments must be handled with care.
- Counterexample: Let F be the 1-ball of a leaf-root. C(F)={root has degree 1}. Its saturation Sat(C(F))={has a leaf somewhere} is not open: in any neighborhood of a rooted graph whose unique leaf lies very far, you can delete that far leaf outside the prescribed ball without altering the ball; hence the neighborhood intersects the complement. Thus, for the forget-the-root map π, π(C(F)) need not be open in any unrooted space derived from G_{\bullet,D} via quotient. Avoid relying on π being open.

4) Parity and bridges in regular graphs: fix scope and statements.
- 1-way infinite bridges cannot occur in any D-regular graph (all D≥2): if an edge e is a bridge with a finite side S, then |δ(S)|=1 and ∑_{v∈S}deg_G(v)=D|S|−1 is odd, contradicting the handshake lemma on the finite induced subgraph. Replace “in even D” by “in all D”.
- 2-way infinite bridges may exist for even D (e.g., the D-regular tree). Adjust the narrative in Theorems 14–16 accordingly.

5) Theorem 14 (bridgeless is nowhere dense): Δ≤D vs Δ=D requires explicit, degree-aware gadgets.
- Δ≤D: the “attach a leaf at the boundary” refinement needs a completion lemma: given a nonempty cylinder C(F) with a boundary vertex b of deg_F(b)<D, attaching a pendant leaf at b within the next radius yields a subcylinder whose every completion has a 1-way infinite bridge. Provide the short proof: every completion must keep that leaf pendant—no other path can reach it without altering the prescribed ball—so the incident edge is a bridge with a finite side.
- Δ= D: 1-way bridges are impossible. You need a port/hub gadget that ensures exactly one external connection in any D-regular completion and makes that edge a 2-way infinite bridge. Concretely: saturate all boundary degrees except two designated vertices x,y by internal wiring; leave x,y with exactly one free stub each. Then any D-regular completion must use exactly one external edge at x and exactly one at y; force that x and y lie in different infinite components beyond the ball and are connected by a single edge (or construct two disjoint “ports” that any completion must connect uniquely). Provide the finite gadget and a completion lemma guaranteeing nonemptiness in Δ=D.

6) Theorem 16 (2-way infinite bridges are meagre but not ND): scope and full proof needed.
- Scope: holds in Δ≤D (all D≥2). In Δ=D it also holds (the set is nonempty for both odd and even D). State the scope precisely.
- ND decomposition: For each k, let B_k be the set “there exists a 2-way infinite bridge with midpoint at distance ≤k from the root.” From any cylinder, refine by adding small cycles through all edges within distance ≤k so no such edge can be a bridge in any completion. This shows B_k is nowhere dense. Provide the explicit construction and degree budget (in Δ=D, use internal saturations so degrees remain D and completions exist).
- Density: Given a cylinder, complete arbitrarily and far outside splice two infinite components and connect by a single edge (in Δ≤D), or prepare two outer ports (in Δ=D) and connect them by a single edge. This yields a completion in the property; hence the union ⋃_k B_k is dense, so not nowhere dense.

7) Theorem 17 (χ′=D is nowhere dense): supply explicit class-2 finite subgraphs and extension details.
- For even D, take K_{D+1}. For odd D≥3, fix a known class-2 D-regular graph (Petersen for D=3; cite a general construction for odd D). Embed it inside an r′-ball and saturate boundary degrees to ≤D (or =D) so any completion contains it; conclude χ′≥D+1 in every completion.

8) Theorem 4 (weak 6-flows) finite satisfiability is unclear.
- The augmented finite graphs G_r with a sink v_∞ may have bridges, so invoking Seymour’s 6-flow theorem for bridgeless graphs is not directly applicable. Either: (a) modify the augmentation to ensure the finite constraint system you impose is known to be solvable (e.g., ensure Eulerian conditions and no cut encountering 1-way effects), and cite a finite weak-flow theorem; or (b) give a direct argument that every finite subset of your Boolean+parity constraints is satisfiable on G_r. Provide precise references (what is [7] here?) and a compatibility argument across r.

Ambiguity sets Amb_k: fix the flaw and outline a correct rigidification
- Flaw in current sketch: Decorating only beyond a single boundary vertex b cannot break (G,u)≅(G,v) if u and v are symmetric within the fixed r-ball; outside decorations seen via b are the same from both roots and can be permuted by an isomorphism extending an interior symmetry. Thus the proposed “hub at b with beacons” is insufficient.
- Corrected strategy (outer-shell rigidification, Δ≤D, D≥3): From a nonempty cylinder C(F) and k, choose R≫r+k and define a refined r′-ball F′ with layers from r+1 to R under your control. For each boundary vertex at level r, attach exactly one new neighbor at level r+1 and, beyond it, build a large finite “signature tree” (degree ≤D) whose leaf signatures are pairwise non-isomorphic across different boundary vertices. This forces any automorphism fixing the outermost sphere to fix all vertices at level r+1, hence at level r, and inductively all vertices within distance ≤k of the root. Additionally, vary the depths of certain unique beacons so that, for each vertex w at distance ≤k and its distinct neighbors u≠v, the multisets of distances from u and v to the nearest beacon(s) differ; this guarantees (G,u) and (G,v) are not isomorphic as rooted graphs in any completion. Only vertices outside B_r receive new edges.
- Δ= D: first choose R≥r so that some boundary vertex has spare degree (nonempty cylinder implies existence). Saturate degrees within the new shells so all vertices at distance <R have degree D in F′ while leaving exactly one “port” at some boundary vertex to anchor the rigidifying trees. Use the same beacon variation and provide a completion lemma showing D-regular completions exist.
- Deliverables to make this rigorous: (i) a clear definition of the signature trees to ensure pairwise non-isomorphism; (ii) precise degree bookkeeping; (iii) proof that the pointwise stabilizer of the outer sphere is trivial on the inner radius ≤k; (iv) for Δ=D, a completion lemma ensuring nonemptiness of the refined cylinder.
- Outcome: Each Amb_k is nowhere dense. With a standard re-rooting template coverage (saturation by countably many finite path moves), one can then deduce: the saturation of a nowhere-dense set is meagre on a comeagre domain, completing the meagre half for D≥3 (details still to be written).

Additional minor fixes
- Lemma 13 (nonemptiness). The second bullet gives a sufficient condition for Δ≤D. Please either restrict it to Δ≤D explicitly and add the short constructive proof, or state a correct criterion for Δ=D (nontrivial and not needed if you avoid it). Also correct the global claim “for all D>2, G_{\bullet,D} is not meagre”: the whole space of infinite Δ≤D rooted graphs is Baire (indeed Polish), but spell out the subspace you work in (exclude finite graphs explicitly).

Next steps (concrete and auditable)
- Replace the ND proof by the cylinder refinement criterion (already correct in Current Output) and remove the claim about Int(cl(S)). Add the short proof that closure of a saturated set is saturated.
- Insert the explicit non-openness example for saturation of a cylinder to justify the quotient caveat.
- Correct parity statements on bridges; restate Theorems 14–16 with precise scope, and supply the missing gadgets plus completion lemmas (port/hub for Δ=D; cycles to block near-root bridges; density construction far outside).
- For Amb_k, write a full outer-shell rigidification lemma (both Δ≤D and Δ=D), with degree budgets and a completion lemma. Then formalize the re-rooting template covering and conclude “saturation of nowhere-dense ⇒ meagre” on a comeagre domain for D≥3.
- Clarify the finite satisfiability in Theorem 4 with a correct finite result or a modified augmentation.

Sanity checks/examples
- D-regular even: the D-regular tree shows 2-way infinite bridges exist; use it to correct Theorem 16’s narrative. No 1-way bridges in any D-regular graph (include the one-line parity proof).
- Saturation vs openness: “has a leaf somewhere” is dense and not open; good to showcase why quotient-openness fails.

Summary of what is firm
- ND root-invariance is settled by a root-free cylinder criterion relying only on saturation and the clopen basis.
- The quotient approach must avoid openness claims; rely on cylinders in the rooted space instead.
- With corrected gadgetry and explicit completion lemmas, Theorems 14–17 can be made rigorous; Theorem 4’s finite step needs repair.
- The meagre half is within reach via outer-shell rigidification and re-rooting templates, but requires full details before inclusion in Main Results.


=== Prover 2 Output ===

Ideas
- Correct a flaw: Amb_k (points allowing a k‑step re‑root with a globally indistinguishable next neighbor) is not nowhere dense; e.g., the D‑regular tree ball lies in Amb_1 and has nonempty interior. So the earlier Amb_k strategy cannot establish meagreness of saturations in general.
- New route for the meagre half (for bridges): directly show that, for each fixed k, the set of rootings with a bridge within distance ≤k is nowhere dense by forcing cycles around all k‑local edges via a low‑degree “merger network” attached beyond a large outer sphere. This works uniformly for Δ≤D and Δ=D when D≥3, and yields meagreness of “has a 2‑way infinite bridge” as a countable union over k.

Completion lemma for Δ=D
Lemma 1 (ball completion, Δ=D). Fix D≥3. Let F be a finite connected graph with a designated root ρ and radius R layers L_0,…,L_R (distances from ρ), with Δ(F)≤D. Then there exists a countably infinite connected D‑regular graph G with B_R(G,ρ)≅F.
Proof. For each x∈L_R, let q(x)=D−deg_F(x)≥1 be its deficit. Take a countable family {T_i} of pairwise disjoint infinite D‑regular trees. In each T_i delete one vertex z_i, obtaining D “port” vertices of degree D−1 in components {C_{i,1},…,C_{i,D}}. Enumerate the multiset of deficits {q(x): x∈L_R} as a sequence, and greedily assign to each missing stub a fresh port vertex (across the disjoint {C_{i,j}}), adding an edge from x to that port. Each boundary vertex x gains q(x) neighbors, reaching degree D; each port rises from degree D−1 to D. The resulting graph is connected (contains F and each C_{i,j} attached to F) and D‑regular. Since new edges emanate only from L_R, the R‑ball about ρ remains F. ∎

Nowhere density of k‑local bridges (D≥3)
Proposition 2. Fix D≥3 and k∈ℕ. Let Br_≤k be the set of (G,ρ)∈G_{•,D} that contain a bridge at distance ≤k from ρ. Then Br_≤k is nowhere dense in both G_{•,≤D} and G_{•,=D}.
Proof. Let G_{•}^{F_0} be a nonempty cylinder of radius r. Choose R≫r+k and extend F_0 to a finite ball F_1 of radius R by a tree‑like expansion: for every vertex y at distance s with r≤s<R, add D−deg(y) fresh neighbors at distance s+1 (for Δ= D: add exactly D−deg(y) neighbors; for Δ≤D: add at most D−deg(y)), and keep edges only between consecutive layers, no intra‑layer edges. Thus every x∈L_R is a leaf (deg_F1(x)=1). Let E_k be the finite set of edges e of F_1 with both endpoints at distance ≤k from ρ.
For each e∈E_k, delete e in F_1; since R≫k and every layer expands forward, each of the two components meets L_R. Choose a pair of boundary vertices b_e^+,b_e^−∈L_R, one from each component. Let B=⋃_{e∈E_k}{b_e^+,b_e^−}. Build a finite “merger network” S: a tree whose internal vertices have degree ≤3 and whose leaves are in bijection with B. Place S entirely outside L_R, and join each leaf of S to its corresponding boundary vertex in B. Let F′ be the resulting finite ball of radius R′>R (the minimum radius containing S and its attachments). Degree feasibility: every boundary vertex in B increases degree by 1 (from 1 to 2) within F′; all internal vertices of S have degree ≤3≤D. Hence Δ(F′)≤D. Non‑emptiness: in Δ≤D, extend F′ arbitrarily further with degree ≤D by attaching trees to the remaining boundary stubs; in Δ= D, apply Lemma 1 to complete B_{R′} to a D‑regular infinite G.
Now take any (H,ρ)∈G_{•}^{F′}. Let e∈E_k. In H, the two components of H−e each contain one of b_e^+,b_e^−. The merger tree S yields an H‑path between b_e^+ and b_e^− that avoids e, so e lies on a cycle. Therefore no edge at distance ≤k is a bridge in H. As this holds for all extensions H of F′, we have G_{•}^{F′}⊂G_{•}^{F_0}∖Br_≤k. By the cylinder characterization, Br_≤k is nowhere dense. ∎

Meagreness of 2‑way infinite bridges and root‑invariance (D≥3)
Corollary 3. For D≥3, the set S_{2w} of rooted graphs whose underlying graph has a 2‑way infinite bridge is meagre (but not nowhere dense) in G_{•,D}. Moreover, this meagreness is root‑invariant.
Proof. If G has a 2‑way infinite bridge, then for each root ρ there exists k with a bridge at distance ≤k from ρ. Hence S_{2w}=⋃_{k≥0} Br_≤k. By Proposition 2 each Br_≤k is nowhere dense, so S_{2w} is meagre. Root‑invariance is immediate since S_{2w} is saturated and the decomposition uses only the k‑local condition relative to the root. ∎

Remarks, examples, and corrections
- The merger network S avoids high‑degree hubs and works uniformly for Δ≤D and Δ= D provided D≥3. The D=2 case is exceptional (max degree bound precludes any branching outside), consistent with earlier caveats.
- This framework immediately recovers Theorem 16 in the notes with explicit degree bookkeeping and a completion argument for the Δ= D case.
- Ambiguity sets Amb_k are not small in general: for the D‑regular tree T_D, every neighbor of the root yields a global rooted isomorphism, so the cylinder of B_r(T_D) lies in Amb_1 for all r. Thus Amb_k need not be nowhere dense, invalidating that earlier route.

Next steps
- Extend the merger‑network method to other “existential obstruction” properties P where P at distance ≤k can be locally destroyed by wiring boundary vertices (e.g., forbidding k‑local cut edges or enforcing k‑local 2‑edge‑connectivity). Formalize a general “local avoidability” criterion: if for every cylinder and k one can refine beyond the outer sphere to forbid P within distance ≤k in all extensions, then S_P is meagre (as ⋃_k nowhere dense sets). Apply to additional properties from the notes.
- Investigate D=2 separately, where the merger network is impossible; classify smallness of bridge‑related properties in G_{•,=2} and G_{•,≤2}.
- For the general meagre half beyond such P, explore category‑preserving selectors on comeagre domains or alternative game‑theoretic arguments to bypass the need for Amb_k to be small.

Critical analysis with concrete fixes and proofs

Overview
- The nowhere‑dense (ND) half of the conjecture is correct as currently stated (via the cylinder criterion). However, there are technical inaccuracies in Section 2 (metric equivalences, cylinder nonemptiness) that should be corrected to avoid later misuse.
- The proof sketches for Theorems 14–17 need substantial strengthening. In particular, Theorem 14’s “attach a leaf” does not force a bridge in all extensions; Theorem 17 contains a false parity claim.
- Theorem 4 (weak 6‑flow without 1‑way infinite bridges) appears false as stated; the infinite d‑regular tree (d≥3) is a counterexample. A corrected version should assume “no bridges at all.”
- For the meagre half of the conjecture, quotient‑space arguments remain invalid; a local re‑rooting homeomorphism approach on refined cylinders is the right direction, but needs explicit gadgets and a comeagre coverage lemma.

1) Metric and topology: corrections and proofs
A) Off‑by‑one in the metric equivalence. With R=\sup{ r∈ℕ : B_r(G,ρ)≅B_r(H,σ) } and d_\bullet=2^{−R}, the correct relationships are:
- B_r(G,ρ)≅B_r(H,σ) ⇔ d_\bullet((G,ρ),(H,σ)) ≤ 2^{−r}.
- For all r and 0<ε≤2^{−(r+1)}: U_{2^{−r}+ε}((G,ρ)) = \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{B_r(G,ρ)}.
Proof. If B_r agrees then R≥r, so d≤2^{−r}<2^{−r}+ε. Conversely, if d<2^{−r}+ε≤2^{−r}+2^{−(r+1)}<2^{−r+1}, then d=2^{−q} with q≥r, hence B_r agrees.
B) Cylinders are clopen. \mathbf{G}_\bullet^F is open by (A) and closed since its complement is a finite union of cylinders at radius r that disagree with F.
C) Nonemptiness under degree constraints.
- ≤D: \mathbf{G}_\bullet^F∩\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,≤D}≠∅ iff some vertex at distance exactly r has deg_F< D. Necessity: otherwise any extension changes B_r. Sufficiency: attach an infinite ≤D tree at a boundary stub.
- =D: \mathbf{G}_\bullet^F∩\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}≠∅ iff there exists a boundary vertex at distance r with deg_F< D (no further restriction is necessary). Sufficiency: saturate all vertices at distance <r internally to degree D by adding neighbors at distance r+1, and attach disjoint D‑regular trees at boundary deficits.
D) Nowhere‑dense characterization. Replace “⊆ \mathbf{G}_\bullet^F \setminus S” by the correct “⊆ \mathbf{G}_\bullet^F \setminus \overline{S}”. Since cylinders form a base of clopen sets, this is equivalent to Int(\overline{S})=∅.
E) Baire property. Both \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,≤D} and \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D} are compact in the local topology (Aldous–Lyons, 2007), hence Baire; thus “not meagre” holds for \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}.

2) Root‑invariance of nowhere density (ND) is settled
Proposition. For unrooted P, S_P is saturated; for any saturated S, \overline{S} and Int(\overline{S}) are saturated. Hence ND of S_P is root‑invariant.
Proof. Given (G,ρ)∈\overline{S} and u∈V(G), for each t choose r≥t+dist(ρ,u) and (H_r,σ_r)∈S with B_r(H_r,σ_r)≅B_r(G,ρ). Transport the root along the isomorphism to u; saturation gives (H_r,u_r)∈S and B_t(H_r,u_r)≅B_t(G,u), so (G,u)∈\overline{S}. Interior is a union of cylinders, hence saturated. ND is Int(\overline{S_P})=∅, which is root‑free.
Equivalent cylinder criterion (preferred). S_P is ND iff for every rooted r‑ball F there exists an r′‑ball F′ extending F with \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F′}∩S_P=∅.

3) Major flaw: Theorem 4 is false as stated
Counterexample. Let T be the infinite d‑regular tree with d≥3. T is locally finite and every bridge is 2‑way infinite (no 1‑way infinite bridge). Suppose φ: E(T)→A is a weak A‑flow (Kirchhoff at vertices) for any abelian group A. Pick a leaf in a finite truncation and argue by elimination: at any degree‑1 vertex v (in the finite component obtained by deleting faraway edges), Kirchhoff forces φ on its incident edge to be 0; iterating shows φ≡0 on E(T). Equivalently, the cycle space of a tree is trivial, so the only circulation is zero. Thus no nowhere‑zero weak flow exists on T. Conclusion: “no 1‑way infinite bridge” does not suffice.
Correction. A valid statement is: If G is countable, locally finite, and bridgeless (every edge lies on a cycle), then G admits a nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow. Sketch route: For each finite set of vertices U, contract every component of G−U to a single vertex; the resulting finite graph is bridgeless; apply Seymour’s 6‑flow theorem to obtain a nowhere‑zero 6‑flow on the minor; lift it to a weak 6‑flow on G that satisfies Kirchhoff’s law on U. Then compactness yields a global weak 6‑flow. Details should be written carefully; importantly, “bridgeless” is necessary here.

4) Theorem 14 (bridgeless nowhere dense): strengthen gadgets
Issue. In ≤D, “attach a leaf” is insufficient: later extensions can create a cycle through the leaf, killing the bridge.
Fix (≤D). Refine any cylinder \mathbf{G}_\bullet^F to F′ that contains a finite core C such that: all vertices of C at distance <R are saturated to degree D within F′; exactly one boundary vertex z of C lies at distance R with deg_{F′}(z)=1 (its neighbor w∈C); all other boundary vertices of F′ have degree D. In any extension, the only exit from C is through z, hence the edge wz is a 1‑way infinite bridge. Thus bridgeless graphs form a nowhere dense set.
Fix (=D, odd D). Let S(F′)=∑_{v∈V(B_{R}(F′))}(D−deg_{F′}(v)) be the number of external half‑edges. By adding internal edges in the new layer, pair deficits to force S(F′)=1 (possible for odd D by parity: S(F′)≡D|V|−2|E|≡|V| (mod 2)). Place the unique deficit at z as above; then in any D‑regular extension a single external edge attaches at z, forcing a 1‑way infinite bridge. Parity forbids S(F′)=1 for even D, explaining the restriction.

5) Theorem 15 (no cut vertex nowhere dense): provide a concrete gadget
Construct F′ with a vertex v and two lobes L_1,L_2 meeting only at v such that:
- All vertices of L_2 on the boundary are degree‑D within F′ (no external attachments through L_2).
- All boundary deficits of F′ (allowing infinite continuation) lie in L_1.
Then any extension connects the outside only through L_1, so any path from outside to L_2 goes through v; v is a cut vertex in every extension. Provide explicit degree bookkeeping for ≤D and for =D (even D) to ensure feasibility.

6) Theorem 16 (2‑way infinite bridge is meagre but dense)
- Meagre: For fixed k, let P_k be: “there exists a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance ≤k from the root.” Given \mathbf{G}_\bullet^F, refine to F′ so that every edge e within distance ≤k lies on a triangle in F′: route from each endpoint to two boundary vertices with spare capacity (guaranteed by 1C), and connect them outside the original ball to form a bypass path, turning e into part of a cycle. Thus P_k is nowhere dense. Hence ⋃_k P_k (the set of graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge) is meagre.
- Dense (so not nowhere dense): Given any \mathbf{G}_\bullet^F, extend far outside B_r to attach two disjoint infinite trees T_1,T_2 and connect them by a single edge e; e is a 2‑way infinite bridge in any extension. Hence the set is dense. Conclude: meagre but not nowhere dense.

7) Theorem 17 (edge‑chromatic number): fix parity error
The claim “removing an edge preserves χ′=D+1 by parity” is false (e.g., K_3−e has χ′=2). Correct approach: For each D≥3, fix a finite D‑regular class‑2 graph H (even D: K_{D+1}; odd D: snarks for D=3 and known class‑2 families for higher odd D). Given any cylinder, refine to embed H strictly inside the ball while meeting degree budgets; any extension contains H, so χ′≥χ′(H)=D+1. Therefore {χ′=D} is nowhere dense. Add references for existence of H in odd D (e.g., Tashkinov trees, critical class‑2 graphs).

8) Quotient caveat: provide a concrete non‑openness example
Let C be the cylinder “root has degree 1.” Its saturation Sat(C) is “graph has a degree‑1 vertex somewhere,” which equals ⋃_{k≥0} A_k where A_k says “there is a degree‑1 vertex within distance ≤k of the root.” Each A_k is open, so Sat(C) is F_σ but not open in general. Thus the forget‑the‑root quotient map does not send cylinders to open sets; avoid quotient‑openness arguments for meagreness.

9) Local re‑rooting homeomorphisms (meagre root‑invariance program)
Lemma (marker‑based local re‑rooting). Given an r‑ball F and u∈V(F), there exists an extension F_mark (radius r′≥r) and cylinders U=\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F_\mathrm{mark}}, V=\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F_\mathrm{mark}[u]} such that re‑rooting at the uniquely marked copy of u defines a homeomorphism U→V.
Sketch. Extend along a chosen geodesic from the root to u and place a unique “beacon” tree on the boundary of that geodesic; uniqueness pins down u (by a fixed offset). Degree constraints: in ≤D use a boundary stub; in =D (odd D) first enforce a unique external stub by parity and place the beacon there. This yields partial homeomorphisms implementing finite re‑rootings on refined cylinders. Meagreness is preserved under such homeomorphisms. Completing meagre root‑invariance requires covering a comeagre set by countably many such domains; this is the remaining technical task.

Actionable next steps
- Fix Section 2 with items 1A–1E (include short proofs in proofs.md).
- Replace Theorem 4 by the bridgeless version (or provide a new finite‑satisfiability argument, otherwise retract as false; include the tree counterexample).
- Strengthen Theorems 14–17 with the concrete gadgets above; add degree bookkeeping and parity checks.
- Develop the marker‑based re‑rooting cover on a comeagre domain to advance the meagre half of the conjecture (D≥3; treat D=2 separately).

### Typical properties of countable graphs: flows and bridges  
*(Extended abstract)*  

**Robert Šámal**\* · **Hadi Zamani**\*

#### Abstract
We have two aims. **First**, we study nowhere‑zero flows in countably infinite graphs, observing the different roles of two types of bridges. **Second**, we study how typical graphs with these types of bridges are. As there is no natural probability measure to use, we turn to an analytic approach: we study which sets are nowhere dense and which are meagre.

In finite graphs, bridges play a crucial role—it is easy to see that every flow assigns value \(0\) to every bridge. It is also known that graphs with a bridge are not typical: both dense random graphs and random regular graphs are bridgeless w.h.p. [3, 1]. We ask how this transfers to countable graphs. In Section 1 we explain differences between bridges and flows and, via compactness, we prove a version of Seymour’s 6‑flow theorem for countable graphs.

In Section 2 we explore nowhere‑dense and meagre sets. This is called for because the usual probabilistic models collapse: extending Erdős–Rényi to countably infinite graphs yields the Rado graph a.s., so we are effectively studying a single graph up to isomorphism. Attempting random regular graphs via the configuration model [1] would require a uniform distribution on perfect matchings of a countable set (e.g., neighbors of the first vertex), which does not exist. Consequently, we turn to Baire category: meagre/co‑meagre sets (also “first/second category”).

### 1. Nowhere‑zero flows for infinite graphs

**Definition 1 (weak flow).**  
Given an orientation \(D\) of a graph \(G\) and an abelian group \(A\), a **weak \(A\)‑flow** is a function \(\varphi:E(G)\to A\) such that **Kirchhoff’s law for each vertex cut** holds:
\[
\forall v\in V(G):\quad \sum_{e\in \delta^-(v)}\varphi(e)=\sum_{e\in \delta^+(v)}\varphi(e).
\]

**Definition 2 (strong flow).**  
Given \(D,G,A\) as above, a **strong \(A\)‑flow** is a function \(\varphi:E(G)\to A\) such that **Kirchhoff’s law for each cut** holds:
\[
\forall S\subseteq V(G):\quad \sum_{e\in \delta^+(S)}\varphi(e)=\sum_{e\in \delta^-(S)}\varphi(e).
\]

In either case, \(\varphi\) is a **nowhere‑zero** weak/strong \(A\)‑flow if \(\varphi^{-1}(0)=\varnothing\).

**Definition 3 (bridge).**  
An edge \(e\) of \(G\) is a **bridge** if deleting \(e\) increases the number of connected components. A bridge is **2‑way infinite** if both resulting components are infinite, and **1‑way infinite** otherwise.

Every strong flow is a weak flow. While the two notions are equivalent on finite graphs, they diverge on infinite graphs: e.g., on a two‑way infinite path, a nowhere‑zero weak \(A\)‑flow exists but a strong one does not. In [6] the authors construct a 3‑connected graph with two ends that admits a nowhere‑zero weak \(A\)‑flow but no nowhere‑zero strong \(A\)‑flow. Nearly all finite flow theorems extend to infinite **strong** \(A\)‑flows via topological compactness; here we use **logical** compactness to obtain:

**Theorem 4.**  
*A countably infinite, locally finite graph without a 1‑way infinite bridge has a nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow.*

### 2. Metric space of rooted connected graphs

Since no good probability measure exists for countable graphs, we study typicality via a metric topology and Baire category.

**Definition 5 (ε‑neighborhood).**  
For a metric space \((X,d)\) and \(x\in X\), the ε‑neighborhood is \(U_\varepsilon(x)=\{y\in X:\ d(x,y)<\varepsilon\}\). The closed neighborhood \(\overline{U}_\varepsilon(x)\) uses \(d(x,y)\le \varepsilon\).

**Definition 6 (open set).**  
A set \(U\subseteq X\) is open if \(\forall x\in U\ \exists \varepsilon>0:\ U_\varepsilon(x)\subseteq U\).

We now fix the graph space and metric.

**Definition 9 (space of rooted graphs).**  
Let \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) be the set of all connected rooted graphs (up to root‑preserving isomorphism). For \(D>2\), let \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) be those with all degrees \(\le D\), and \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) those with all degrees \(=D\).

**Definition 10 (r‑ball).**  
For \((G,v)\), the rooted r‑ball is
\[
B_r(G,v)=(\,G[\{y\in V(G): d(v,y)\le r\}],\,v\,).
\]

**Definition 11 (metric \(d_\bullet\)).**  
For \((G_1,v_1),(G_2,v_2)\in\mathbf{G}_\bullet\),
\[
d_\bullet\big((G_1,v_1),(G_2,v_2)\big)=\inf\{2^{-r} : B_r(G_1,v_1)\cong B_r(G_2,v_2)\}.
\]
This is a metric [5].

**Definition 12 (extensions of an r‑ball).**  
For an r‑ball \(F=B_r(G,v)\), define
\[
\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F=\{(G',v')\in \mathbf{G}_\bullet : B_r(G',v')\cong F\}.
\]

**Lemma 13 (basic facts in \((\mathbf{G}_\bullet,d_\bullet)\)).**  
- For each \((G,x)\), \(r\in\mathbb{N}\), and \(0<\varepsilon<1\):
  \[
  U_{2^{-r}+\varepsilon}((G,x))=U_{2^{-r}}((G,x))=\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{B_r(G,x)}.
  \]
- \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F\) is nonempty if \(F\) is an r‑ball in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) that contains a vertex of degree \< \(D\) at distance \(r\) from the root.
- A subset \(S\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) is nowhere dense iff
  \(\forall\) r‑balls \(F\ \exists\) r′‑ball \(F'\) with \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F'}\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F}\setminus S\).
- For all \(D>2\), \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) is not meagre.

### Main results on typical properties

**Theorem 14.**  
*The set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense (i) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) for all \(D>2\); and (ii) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) for all odd \(D>2\).*  
In D‑regular graphs with even \(D\), 1‑way infinite bridges cannot exist; instead we obtain:

**Theorem 15.**  
*The set of graphs without a cut vertex is nowhere dense in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

**Theorem 16.**  
*The set of graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge is meagre (but not nowhere dense) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

We also considered other (a)typical properties:

**Theorem 17.**  
*The set of graphs with edge‑chromatic number \(D\) is nowhere dense in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

### 3. Proof sketches

**Proof of Theorem 4 (sketch).**  
Let the vertices of \(G\) be \(v_1,v_2,\ldots\) and orient each edge \(\{v_i,v_j\}\) from the smaller to the larger index. For each radius \(r\), augment the r‑ball \(B_r(G,v_1)\) to a finite multigraph \(G_r\) by adding a sink vertex \(v_\infty\) and connecting boundary edges to \(v_\infty\). Introduce Boolean variables \(F_{e,1},\dots,F_{e,6}\) encoding which of six nonzero values an edge \(e\) receives, enforce exclusivity \(\bigvee_i F_{e,i}\) and \(\bigwedge_{j\ne i}\neg F_{e,j}\), and write linear parity constraints at each vertex (Kirchhoff’s law). Let \(F_{G_r}\) be the conjunction over vertices of \(G_r\); then every finite subset of the constraint family \(\{F_{G_r}\}_r\cup\{F_{e,i}\}_e\) is satisfiable (by [7]), hence by compactness [4] the whole set is satisfiable, yielding a nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow on \(G\).

**Proof idea for Theorem 14.**  
Given an r‑ball \(F\), construct an r′‑ball \(F'\) such that every extension of \(F'\) contains a bridge. For \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\), attach a leaf to a boundary vertex of degree \<\(D\). For \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) handle regularity via parity gadgets: define \(S(F)=\sum_{v\in L_r}(D-\deg v)\) where \(L_r\) is the boundary; use \(K_{D+1}-e\) gadgets and tree‑like expansions to force parity \(S(F)=1\), then attach a new vertex to create a bridge. Hence the bridgeless set is nowhere dense.

**Proof idea for Theorem 15.**  
In even \(D\)‑regular graphs, use gadgets to force a cut vertex; in odd \(D\) or degree‑bounded spaces, this also follows from the previous construction.

**Proof idea for Theorem 16.**  
Being “there is a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance \(k\)” is nowhere dense; take a union over \(k\in\mathbb{N}\) to get a meagre (but not nowhere‑dense) set.

**Proof idea for Theorem 17.**  
For each \(D\), there exist \(D\)‑regular graphs with \(\chi'(G)=D+1\) (even \(D\): complete graphs or any odd‑order \(D\)‑regular graph; odd \(D\): by Tutte’s theorem). Removing an edge preserves \(\chi'=D+1\) by parity. Embed parity gadgets within r‑balls so that every extension has edge‑chromatic number \(D+1\), hence the set is nowhere dense.

---

### 4. Future work (the conjectures)

**Question 18.** *Is the fact that a property is nowhere dense or meagre independent of the root?*  
A change of root gives one type of change of metric; however, many metrics on the space of countable graphs are possible.

**Question 19.** *Is there another metric on \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) where typical properties are different?*  
For instance, is there a metric in which **bridgeless graphs are typical**?

We also aim to investigate additional (a)typical properties in the spirit of Theorem 17.
