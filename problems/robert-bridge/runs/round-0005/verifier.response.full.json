Then there exists a countably infinite connected D-regular graph G with B_R(G,\u03c1)\u2245F.\\nProof. For each x\u2208L_R, let q(x)=D\u2212deg_F(x)\u22650 and s=\u2211_{x\u2208L_R}q(x)\u22651.

Let C(F_0) be a nonempty cylinder of radius r. Choose R\u226br+k. Extend F_0 to a layered finite ball F_1 of radius R by adding new layers r+1,\u2026,R so that: (a) all vertices at distance <R have degree \u2264D and, in the \u0394=D case, exactly D; (b) every vertex in the outer layer L_R has degree 1 (only the back-edge to L_{R\u22121}). Let E_k be the finite set of edges e of F_1 whose endpoints lie at distance \u2264k from \u03c1.\\nFor each e=ab\u2208E_k, choose two internally vertex-disjoint a\u2192L_R and b\u2192L_R paths in F_1 that avoid e (possible since between r and R we can allocate disjoint forward branches; choose R large enough to separate these finitely many requirements). Let their endpoints in L_R be denoted b_e^+ and b_e^\u2212, with all these endpoints distinct across different e. Outside L_R, build a finite merger tree S whose leaves are in bijection with the set B={b_e^+,b_e^\u2212: e\u2208E_k}, and join each such leaf to its corresponding boundary vertex in L_R. Let F\u2032 be the resulting finite ball of radius R\u2032>R (add only edges and vertices beyond L_R). In the \u0394= D case, all vertices at distance <R already have degree D; in the \u0394\u2264D case, all degrees remain \u2264D; S can be chosen with maximum degree 3\u2264D.

For density, given any cylinder C(F_0), extend beyond a large radius to obtain an infinite completion A; attach an additional infinite tree T disjoint from A and join A to T by a single edge e whose endpoints lie outside the prescribed ball. Then e is a 2-way infinite bridge in the resulting completion, which lies in C(F_0). This works under \u0394\u2264D; for \u0394=D, first ensure (by extending the ball) two designated boundary vertices have spare degree and attach the two infinite D-regular trees at those vertices before adding e; Lemma A provides D-regular completions.
