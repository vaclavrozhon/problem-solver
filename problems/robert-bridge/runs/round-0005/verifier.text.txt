  "feedback_md": "Progress: The nowhere-dense (ND) half is now correctly handled via the clopen-cylinder refinement criterion. The Current Output states a root-free characterization for S_P that is valid and avoids unnecessary claims about Int(cl(S)). Good.\n\nMain issues and fixes:\n- Quotient openness: Prover 1 still relies on π(C) being open. This is false for the forget-the-root quotient in the rooted local topology; the saturation of a cylinder is typically F_sigma, not open. Provide a concrete counterexample (“root has degree 1” → “has a leaf somewhere”) and avoid quotient-based openness for both ND and meagreness.\n- Ambiguity sets: The earlier plan to show Bad_{m,ℓ} or Amb_k are small fails in general (e.g., D-regular trees place entire cylinders in Amb_1). Prover 2 correctly retracts this and proposes a direct ND proof for k-local bridges via a merger network beyond a large outer sphere. This is a sound direction.\n- Metric facts: Off-by-one in the equivalence d<2^{-r}⇔B_r agrees must be fixed everywhere to prevent radius slippage in cylinder arguments (P3’s correction is right).\n- Theorem 4: As stated (no 1-way infinite bridges ⇒ weak 6-flow) is false; the infinite D-regular tree (D≥3) has no weak nowhere-zero flow. A correct version should assume bridgelessness. Retract or restate with a precise finite satisfiability argument.\n- Bridges gadgets: The “attach a leaf” alone does not force a bridge in all completions for ≤D. You must saturate interior degrees (to D) within a finite core and leave a unique external port to force a cut-edge in every completion (for ≤D and for =D with odd D; even-D regular forbids 1-way bridges by parity). P3 describes the right shape; full bookkeeping is needed.\n- 2-way bridges: Prover 2’s rigorous scheme for: (i) Br_≤k nowhere dense (via a merger network), and (ii) union over k meagre and dense, is correct for D≥3. This also settles root-invariance of meagreness for this specific P since S_P is saturated and is a countable union of k-local ND sets. Please integrate this with a Δ=D completion lemma that preserves the inner ball.\n\nConcrete next steps:\n1) Finalize and write the Δ=D completion lemma (finish degrees and connectivity) and the k-local bridge ND proof with full radius and degree bookkeeping (we supply a cleaned proof in proofs.md). Then add the corollary that “has a 2-way infinite bridge” is meagre (not ND) for D≥3.\n2) Remove quotient-openness claims; add the non-openness example to notes.\n3) Correct parity/scope statements for bridges; ensure Theorems 14–16 reflect that even D-regular graphs admit 2-way bridges but not 1-way bridges.\n4) Either retract Theorem 4 or restate with “bridgeless” and supply a correct compactness/finite satisfiability argument.\n5) Keep the ND root-invariance theorem and cylinder toolkit as the main general result. Broader meagre root-invariance remains open; continue with local re-rooting on comeagre domains if feasible.\n",

No use of Int(cl(S)) being saturated is needed.\n- Quotient caveat: The saturation of a cylinder need not be open (e.g., the cylinder “root has degree 1” saturates to “has a leaf somewhere,” an F_sigma but not open set). Thus forget-the-root quotient arguments that require π(C) to be open are invalid in this topology.\n- Theorem 4 status: As stated (no 1-way infinite bridges ⇒ weak 6-flow) it is false; the infinite D-regular tree (D≥3) has no nonzero weak flow. A correct direction requires assuming bridgelessness.\n- Bridges: Even D-regular graphs admit 2-way infinite bridges (regular tree example) but forbid 1-way bridges by parity; odd D admits 1-way bridges.\n\nMeagre result for 2-way bridges (D≥3)\n- For each k, let Br_≤k be rootings with a bridge within distance ≤k of the root. Given any nonempty cylinder B_r(G,ρ), pick R≫r+k and build a layered refinement so that from each edge e within distance ≤k one can route internally to two distinct boundary vertices; then, beyond the outer sphere, add a finite merger network joining those boundary pairs. In every completion, each such e lies on a cycle. Hence Br_≤k is nowhere dense. The union over k is meagre.\n- Density: Inside any cylinder, we can complete to an infinite graph and far outside attach an infinite component by a single edge to the existing infinite part. This produces a 2-way infinite bridge. Thus the property is meagre but not nowhere dense. Root-invariance follows since the set is saturated.\n\nΔ=D completion (sketch): If all vertices at distance <R have degree D in the refined ball and at least one boundary vertex has spare degree, then there exists a D-regular infinite extension preserving the R-ball (see proofs). This supports the Δ=D case of the merger construction.\n\nOpen directions\n- General meagre root-invariance remains open. Continue with partial homeomorphisms (marker-based re-rooting) on a comeagre domain, or isolate broader classes P where k-local avoidance suffices."

    "content": "Lemma A (Δ=D ball completion). Let D≥3 and let F be a finite rooted graph of radius R with root ρ. Assume (i) every vertex v with dist_F(ρ,v)<R has deg_F(v)=D; and (ii) at least one vertex x in the outer layer L_R has deg_F(x)<D. Then there exists a countably infinite connected D-regular graph G with B_R(G,ρ)≅F.\nProof. For each x∈L_R, let q(x)=D−deg_F(x)≥0 and s=∑_{x∈L_R}q(x)≥1. Build an external reservoir as follows. Take a single infinite D-regular tree T, and delete a countable family M={e_i=u_i v_i : i∈ℕ} of pairwise edge-disjoint edges. In the resulting graph T−M, the set U={u_i,v_i : i∈ℕ} consists of vertices of degree D−1; all other vertices retain degree D. Choose distinct w_1,…,w_s∈U, and partition {w_1,…,w_s} into subsets of sizes {q(x)} indexed by x∈L_R. Form G_0 by taking the disjoint union of F and T−M and, for each x∈L_R, adding edges from x to its assigned q(x) vertices in U. Now every x∈L_R attains degree D; each chosen w_j∈U attains degree D. The remaining vertices in U (still countably many) have degree D−1. Enumerate the connected components of T−M and select one remaining degree-(D−1) vertex from each component; pair these selected vertices along a bi-infinite chain by adding edges between consecutive ones, and pair all other remaining degree-(D−1) vertices arbitrarily in disjoint edges. This yields a graph O in which all vertices have degree D and O is connected. Let G be the union of F and O with the attachment edges added above. Then G is connected and D-regular. Since all new neighbors of vertices at distance <R lie outside L_R, B_R(G,ρ)=F. ∎\n\nProposition B (k-local bridges are nowhere dense for D≥3). Fix D≥3 and k∈ℕ. Let Br_≤k be the set of rooted graphs (G,ρ) in G_{•,≤D} or G_{•,=D} that have a bridge at distance ≤k from ρ. Then Br_≤k is nowhere dense.\nProof. Let C(F_0) be a nonempty cylinder of radius r. Choose R≫r+k. Extend F_0 to a layered finite ball F_1 of radius R by adding new layers r+1,…,R so that: (a) all vertices at distance <R have degree ≤D and, in the Δ=D case, exactly D; (b) every vertex in the outer layer L_R has degree 1 (only the back-edge to L_{R−1}). Let E_k be the finite set of edges e of F_1 whose endpoints lie at distance ≤k from ρ.\nFor each e=ab∈E_k, choose two internally vertex-disjoint a→L_R and b→L_R paths in F_1 that avoid e (possible since between r and R we can allocate disjoint forward branches; choose R large enough to separate these finitely many requirements). Let their endpoints in L_R be denoted b_e^+ and b_e^−, with all these endpoints distinct across different e. Outside L_R, build a finite merger tree S whose leaves are in bijection with the set B={b_e^+,b_e^−: e∈E_k}, and join each such leaf to its corresponding boundary vertex in L_R. Let F′ be the resulting finite ball of radius R′>R (add only edges and vertices beyond L_R). In the Δ= D case, all vertices at distance <R already have degree D; in the Δ≤D case, all degrees remain ≤D; S can be chosen with maximum degree 3≤D. By construction, for any completion H of F′ (Δ≤D or, using Lemma A, Δ=D) and any e∈E_k, there is an H-path from b_e^+ to b_e^− that avoids e, so e lies on a cycle. Thus no edge within distance ≤k of ρ is a bridge in any completion of F′, i.e., C(F′)⊆C(F_0)\\Br_≤k. Therefore Br_≤k is nowhere dense. ∎\n\nCorollary C (2-way infinite bridges are meagre but not nowhere dense for D≥3). Let S_{2w} be the set of rootings whose underlying graph has a 2-way infinite bridge. Then S_{2w} is meagre and dense in G_{•,≤D} and in G_{•,=D} for D≥3.\nProof. Write S_{2w}=⋃_{k≥0} Br_≤k; by Proposition B each Br_≤k is nowhere dense, hence S_{2w} is meagre. For density, given any cylinder C(F_0), extend beyond a large radius to obtain an infinite completion A; attach an additional infinite tree T disjoint from A and join A to T by a single edge e whose endpoints lie outside the prescribed ball. Then e is a 2-way infinite bridge in the resulting completion, which lies in C(F_0). This works under Δ≤D; for Δ=D, first ensure (by extending the ball) two designated boundary vertices have spare degree and attach the two infinite D-regular trees at those vertices before adding e; Lemma A provides D-regular completions. Hence S_{2w} is dense. ∎"
