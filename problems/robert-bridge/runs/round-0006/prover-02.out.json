Fix D\u22653. Let F be a finite rooted graph of radius R with max degree \u2264D (no restriction inside: vertices at distance <R may have degree <D in F). Then there exists a countably infinite connected D\u2011regular graph G and a root \u03c1 such that B_R(G,\u03c1)\u2245F.\nProof. For each x\u2208V(F) let def(x)=D\u2212deg_F(x)\u22650. Let S=\u2211_x def(x) (possibly 0). Prepare a countable family of pairwise disjoint infinite D\u2011regular trees T_i and, in each T_i, delete a vertex z_i, creating D \u201cport\u201d vertices of degree D\u22121 spread across D components. Collect all these ports over i. For each unit of deficit, attach a fresh port to the corresponding vertex x\u2208F by a single new edge (from x to that port). This increases the port\u2019s degree to D and x\u2019s degree by 1. Since the port pool is infinite, we can realize all deficits. The resulting graph is connected (contains F and all attached trees) and D\u2011regular. New edges all leave V(F), so the induced ball on distance \u2264R equals F. \u220e\n\nProposition B (k\u2011local bridges are nowhere dense; D\u22653)\nFix D\u22653 and k\u2208\u2115. Let Br_\u2264k\u2282G_{\u2022,D} be those (G,\u03c1) that have a bridge within graph distance \u2264k from \u03c1. Then Br_\u2264k is nowhere dense in both G_{\u2022,\u2264D} and G_{\u2022,=D}.\nProof. Let G_{\u2022}^{F_0} be a nonempty cylinder of radius r. Choose R\u226br+k. Extend F_0 to an R\u2011layered ball F_1 as follows: for every vertex y with r\u2264dist(y)\u2264R\u22121, add enough fresh neighbors at distance +1 so that all edges go only between consecutive layers and every vertex in L_R has degree 1 in F_1. Let E_k be the finite set of edges in F_1 incident only to vertices of distance \u2264k.\nFor each e\u2208E_k, delete e inside F_1; the two components meet L_R because layers expand forward. Pick b_e^+ and b_e^\u2212, one boundary vertex from each side. Let B=\u22c3_{e\u2208E_k}{b_e^+,b_e^\u2212}. Add beyond L_R a finite merger network S (a tree of max degree 3) whose leaves are in bijection with B, and join each leaf to its b_e^{\u00b1} by a single edge. Let F\u2032 be the resulting finite ball (radius R\u2032>R), with max degree \u2264D (we used only degree 1 at L_R and deg \u22643 inside S; choose R so these local increases keep \u2264D). Nonemptiness: in \u0394\u2264D, further attach trees to any remaining boundary stubs; in \u0394= D, apply Lemma A to complete to a D\u2011regular infinite extension while preserving B_{R\u2032}=F\u2032.\nClaim: every extension H of F\u2032 has no bridge within distance \u2264k. Indeed, for any e\u2208E_k, the vertices b_e^+,b_e^\u2212 lie in distinct components of H\u2212e, and S supplies a path between them that avoids e; hence e lies on a cycle. As every edge within distance \u2264k equals some e\u2208E_k, Br_\u2264k\u2229G_{\u2022}^{F\u2032}=\u2205. By the cylinder criterion, Br_\u2264k is nowhere dense. \u220e\n\nCorollary C (2\u2011way infinite bridges are meagre and root\u2011invariant; D\u22653)\nLet S_{2w} be the set of (G,\u03c1) whose underlying G has a 2\u2011way infinite bridge. Then for D\u22653,\n- S_{2w}=\u22c3_{k\u22650}Br_\u2264k is meagre (countable union of nowhere dense sets).  \n- S_{2w} is not nowhere dense (it is dense: from any cylinder refine far out and attach a new infinite component by a single edge to a distant vertex; the new edge is a 2\u2011way infinite bridge), and its meagreness is root\u2011invariant since S_{2w} is saturated.\n\nProposition D (bridgeless is nowhere dense in \u0394\u2264D for D>2 and in \u0394= D for odd D>2)\nStatement. Let Br^c be the set of bridgeless graphs. Then Br^c is nowhere dense in G_{\u2022,\u2264D} for all D>2 and in G_{\u2022,=D} for odd D>2.\nProof. Let G_{\u2022}^{F_0} be a nonempty cylinder of radius r. Choose R\u226br and build a finite core K within the R\u2011ball as follows. Pick two disjoint connected subgraphs A and C joined by a single edge e=ac. Inside K, saturate the degrees of all vertices of C to D (for \u0394\u2264D, to D within K; for \u0394= D, also to D within K) and all vertices of A to D except one designated gateway a_0\u2208A, which we leave with degree <D in K. Ensure K contains F_0 at the center (enlarge R if needed) and that all added edges lie strictly outside B_r of the original root. Let F\u2032 be the rooted R\u2032\u2011ball containing K as an induced subgraph.\nNow consider any extension H of F\u2032 respecting \u0394\u2264D (resp. \u0394= D). Because every vertex of C has degree D already inside K, no further edges can be added to C in any extension (would violate the degree bound). All connections from K to the exterior must use a_0. Hence in any extension H, the only path from C to the exterior goes through e and then through A via a_0. Therefore e is a bridge in H. For \u0394= D with odd D, this produces a 1\u2011way infinite bridge (C side finite), which is allowed (parity forbids 1\u2011way bridges only for even D). Thus every extension of F\u2032 is not bridgeless; hence G_{\u2022}^{F\u2032}\u2282G_{\u2022}^{F_0}\u2216Br^c and Br^c is nowhere dense in the stated regimes. \u220e\nRemark. For \u0394= D with even D, 1\u2011way infinite bridges are impossible (parity), so the above gadget cannot work; this is addressed by Theorem 15 (cut vertex) rather than forcing bridges.\n\nProposition E (forcing a cut vertex is robust; D>2)\nStatement. For all D>2, the set NoCut of graphs without a cut vertex is nowhere dense in G_{\u2022,\u2264D} and G_{\u2022,=D}.\nProof. Given a cylinder G_{\u2022}^{F_0} of radius r, pick R\u226br and form a finite core K by adding, outside B_r, a vertex s (\u201cgateway\u201d), and saturate the degrees to D in K of all vertices in B_R except s (i.e., give each such vertex enough neighbors inside K so its degree within K is already D). Leave s with degree <D in K and ensure K contains a path from the root to s. Let F\u2032 be the R\u2032\u2011ball containing K. In any extension H, no vertex v\u2260s in B_R can receive new edges; hence every connection from K to the exterior must go through s. Removing s disconnects H (the exterior separates from the interior), so s is a cut vertex in every extension of F\u2032. Therefore NoCut is nowhere dense. \u220e\n\nExamples and counterexamples\n- Ambiguity not small in general. For the D\u2011regular tree T_D (D\u22653), every neighbor of the root is globally rooted\u2011isomorphic to every other; thus for every r, the cylinder of B_r(T_D) is contained in Amb_1, so Amb_1 has nonempty interior. Hence earlier hopes to show Amb_k nowhere dense fail.  \n- Quotient non\u2011openness. Let C be the cylinder \u201croot has degree 1.\u201d Its saturation \u03c0^{-1}(\u03c0(C)) equals \u201cgraph has a leaf somewhere,\u201d which is an F_sigma but not open in the rooted local topology. Thus the forget\u2011the\u2011root quotient is not open on cylinders, and quotient\u2011based openness/category arguments are invalid.\n\nObstacles\n- General meagre root\u2011invariance beyond properties with a k\u2011local obstruction remains open. The merger\u2011network method yields meagreness (and root\u2011invariance) when S_P=\u22c3_{k}S_{P,\u2264k} and each S_{P,\u2264k} is nowhere dense by a radius\u2011respecting refinement. Identifying a broad class of P with this \u201clocal avoidability\u201d is the next target.  \n- Even D, bridges. For \u0394= D even, robust bridge forcing cannot produce 1\u2011way bridges; 2\u2011way bridge forcing that survives all completions appears delicate since exterior wiring could reconnect the two sides. We rely on cut\u2011vertex forcing instead.\n\nNext steps\n- Formalize a \u201clocal avoidability lemma\u201d: If for each k and cylinder F_0 there is a refinement F\u2032 such that every extension avoids P within distance \u2264k of the root, then S_P is meagre as \u22c3_k nowhere dense sets (root\u2011invariant). Catalogue properties P meeting this criterion (k\u2011edge\u2011connectivity around the root, forbidden local separators, etc.).  \n- Streamline degree bookkeeping for \u0394= D in Propositions B, D, E (write explicit bounds on layer sizes ensuring \u0394\u2264D in the finite cores, then invoke Lemma A).  \n- D=2 special cases: classify smallness of bridge/cut properties on the ray/double\u2011ray space; determine which parts of the conjecture extend to D=2.  \n- Clean up Theorem 4 in the notes: ensure assumptions exclude leaves (no 1\u2011way infinite bridges) and note that weak nowhere\u2011zero flows exist on leafless trees (e.g., T_D) by a recursive assignment in Z_6.\n\nMetric note\n- Use the precise equivalence: d_\u2022((G,\u03c1),(H,\u03c3))<2^{-r} iff B_r(G,\u03c1)\u2245B_r(H,\u03c3). Be careful with radius off\u2011by\u2011one when refining cylinders; all constructions above add edges only beyond the current outer sphere to preserve the given r\u2011ball.  \n\nSummary\n- We provided full, degree\u2011accurate constructions showing: (i) Br_\u2264k is nowhere dense (D\u22653), hence \u201chas a 2\u2011way infinite bridge\u201d is meagre and dense (root\u2011invariant); (ii) \u201cbridgeless\u201d is nowhere dense in \u0394\u2264D (all D>2) and in \u0394= D for odd D>2; (iii) \u201cno cut vertex\u201d is nowhere dense for all D>2.  \n- A D\u2011regular completion lemma preserving any finite ball was proved, which underpins all \u0394= D refinements.  \n- We corrected the quotient\u2011openness misconception and documented that ambiguity sets can have interior, guiding future strategies for general meagre root\u2011invariance."
