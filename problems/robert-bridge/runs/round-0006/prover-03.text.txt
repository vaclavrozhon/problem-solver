Critical analysis and concrete, checkable fixes

Ideas
- Settle the nowhere‑dense (ND) half via a root‑free cylinder criterion; avoid quotient subtleties. Strengthen Section 2 (metric/topology) and the nonemptiness of cylinders. Correct Theorem 4 (as stated it is false). Provide rigorous gadget frameworks for Theorems 14–17. For the meagre half, pursue local re‑rooting homeomorphisms on refined cylinders; do not rely on quotient openness.

Corrections to Section 2 (metric/topology)
- Off‑by‑one in the equivalence. With R= sup{ r∈ℕ : B_r(G,ρ)≅B_r(H,σ) } and d_•=2^{−R}:
  • B_r(G,ρ)≅B_r(H,σ) iff d_•((G,ρ),(H,σ))≤2^{−r}.
  • For any r and 0<ε≤2^{−(r+1)}: U_{2^{−r}+ε}((G,ρ)) = 𝔾_•^{B_r(G,ρ)}.
  Proof: If B_r agrees then R≥r so d≤2^{−r}<2^{−r}+ε. Conversely, if d<2^{−r}+ε≤2^{−r}+2^{−(r+1)}<2^{−r+1}, then d=2^{−q} with q≥r hence B_r agrees.
- Cylinders are clopen. For any finite rooted ball F, 𝔾_•^F is open by the display above and closed since its complement is a finite union of radius‑r cylinders that disagree with F.
- Nonemptiness of cylinders under degree constraints (useful later and to avoid hidden assumptions):
  • ≤D: 𝔾_•^F∩𝔾_{•,≤D}≠∅ iff some vertex at distance exactly r has deg_F< D. Necessity: adding edges at distance <r changes B_r. Sufficiency: attach an infinite ≤D tree to any boundary stub; B_r unchanged.
  • =D: 𝔾_•^F∩𝔾_{•,=D}≠∅ iff (i) every vertex at distance <r has deg_F=D; and (ii) some vertex at distance r has deg_F< D. Necessity: edges incident to a vertex at distance <r necessarily create new vertices within distance ≤r. Sufficiency: attach disjoint infinite D‑regular trees at boundary stubs.
- Nowhere‑dense characterization: the robust form is “S is ND iff ∀r‑balls F with 𝔾_•^F≠∅ ∃F′ extending F with 𝔾_•^{F′}⊆𝔾_•^F\setminus cl(S).” With clopen basis, this is equivalent to Int(cl(S))=∅.
- Baire property: 𝔾_{•,≤D} and 𝔾_{•,=D} are compact in the local topology (Aldous–Lyons 2007), hence Baire; thus “not meagre” is automatic for these spaces.

Root‑invariance of nowhere density: proofs and presentation
- Keep the current cylinder‑based, root‑free criterion: For unrooted P, S_P is ND iff for every r‑ball F there exists an r′‑ball F′ extending F such that 𝔾_•^{F′}∩S_P=∅. This avoids quotient issues and is fully root‑free.
- Auxiliary fact (for notes/proofs): If S is saturated (closed under re‑rooting), then cl(S) and Int(cl(S)) are saturated. Proof: transport large matching balls and re‑root as usual.

Major flaw: Theorem 4 is false as stated
- Counterexample: The infinite D‑regular tree (D≥3) has no 1‑way infinite bridge yet admits no nonzero weak flow (the only circulation on a tree is 0). Thus “no 1‑way infinite bridge ⇒ nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow” is false.
- Correction (plausible and standard): If G is countable, locally finite, and bridgeless, then G has a nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow. Finite satisfiability: For a finite vertex set U, contract each component of G−U to a single vertex; the resulting finite multigraph is bridgeless (a bridge in the minor would lift to a bridge in G), so Seymour’s 6‑flow theorem yields a nowhere‑zero 6‑flow; restrict to edges incident with U to satisfy Kirchhoff on U. Then use compactness to obtain a global weak 6‑flow. Replace or retract the current Theorem 4 accordingly.

Theorem 14 (bridgeless is nowhere dense): fix gadgets
- ≤D: “Attach a leaf to a boundary vertex” does not force a bridge in every extension (cycles can be created later). Instead, in a refinement F′ build a finite core C and saturate all vertices of C at distance <R to degree D; ensure exactly one boundary vertex z of C at distance R has deg_{F′}(z)=1 (unique neighbor w∈C); all other boundary vertices of F′ (in and out of C) are saturated to degree D. Any extension can attach to C only at z; hence wz is a 1‑way infinite bridge in every extension.
- =D, odd D: Use parity to force a unique external stub. Let S(F′)=∑_{v}(D−deg_{F′}(v)) be the count of external half‑edges. By pairing deficits inside the outer layer we can realize S(F′)=1 for odd D (S(F′)≡D|V|−2|E|≡|V| mod 2). Place the unique stub at a leaf z of C as above. In any D‑regular extension, exactly one edge leaves F′ at z, forcing a 1‑way infinite bridge. For even D, S(F′)=1 is impossible by parity, explaining the restriction.

Theorem 15 (no cut vertex is nowhere dense): provide a concrete construction
- Construct F′ with a vertex v and two lobes L_1,L_2 intersecting only at v. Saturate all boundary vertices of L_2 to degree D within F′ (no external attachments through L_2). Ensure all boundary deficits of F′ lie in L_1 (and possibly outside C). In any extension, the outside can connect only through L_1, so any path from outside to L_2 passes through v; hence v is a cut vertex in every extension. Provide explicit degree bookkeeping for ≤D and for =D (even D) to ensure feasibility.

Theorem 16 (2‑way infinite bridge: meagre and dense)
- Meagre: For fixed k, let P_k be “there exists a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance ≤k from the root.” Given any cylinder 𝔾_•^F, refine to F′ so that every edge e within distance ≤k lies on a cycle inside F′: for each such e with endpoints x,y, choose a large outer radius R and interior paths from x,y to two boundary vertices with spare degree (guaranteed by the nonemptiness lemmas), and add a disjoint path between these two boundary vertices in the layers beyond r to complete a cycle through e. This does not change B_r. Thus P_k is nowhere dense. Hence ⋃_k P_k is meagre.
- Dense (so not nowhere dense): Given any cylinder, construct one extension by attaching two disjoint infinite trees far outside and connect them with a single edge e; this produces a 2‑way infinite bridge in that extension. Therefore the set is dense. Conclude: meagre but not nowhere dense.

Theorem 17 (edge‑chromatic number): fix the parity error
- The statement “removing an edge preserves χ′=D+1 by parity” is false (e.g., K_3−e has χ′=2). Correct forcing: For each D≥3, fix a finite D‑regular class‑2 simple graph H (even D: K_{D+1}; odd D: known families, e.g., snarks for D=3 and higher‑degree class‑2 regular graphs). Given any cylinder, refine to embed H strictly inside while respecting degree budgets; any extension contains H, thus χ′≥χ′(H)=D+1. Therefore the class‑1 set {χ′=D} is nowhere dense. Add suitable references for existence of H for odd D.

Quotient caveat (provide a concrete non‑openness example)
- Let C be the cylinder “root has degree 1.” Its saturation Sat(C) is the set “graph has a leaf somewhere,” which equals ⋃_{k≥0}A_k where A_k says “there is a degree‑1 vertex within distance ≤k of the root.” Sat(C) is F_σ, typically not open. Thus the forget‑the‑root quotient does not send cylinders to open sets; avoid quotient‑based openness in ND/meagre arguments.

Local re‑rooting homeomorphisms (toward meagre root‑invariance)
- Lemma (marker‑based re‑rooting). Given an r‑ball F and u∈V(F), there exists an extension F_mark (radius r′≥r) and cylinders U=𝔾_•^{F_mark}, V=𝔾_•^{F_mark[u]} such that re‑rooting at the uniquely marked copy of u defines a homeomorphism U→V. Construction: extend along a chosen root‑to‑u geodesic and place a unique “beacon” tree on the boundary of that geodesic; uniqueness pins down u. Degree constraints: in ≤D use a boundary stub; in =D (odd D) first enforce a unique external stub by parity. Meagreness and ND are preserved under these homeomorphisms. To settle meagre root‑invariance generally, cover a comeagre set by countably many such domains (technical but plausible).

Examples and sanity checks
- D‑regular trees (D≥3) disprove Theorem 4 as stated and show even‑regular graphs allow 2‑way bridges but forbid 1‑way bridges (parity), consistent with Theorems 14–16.
- D=2 is exceptional; the current results are stated for D>2, which neatly avoids deg‑2 pathologies.

Next steps (auditable tasks)
- Update Section 2: fix metric equivalences, clopen cylinders, nonemptiness criteria, and add a compactness/Baire reference.
- Replace Theorem 4 by the bridgeless version with a full finite‑satisfiability argument (contract outside components; apply Seymour’s theorem; compactness).
- Write full proofs for Theorems 14–16 with explicit degree bookkeeping and parity counts. In particular, replace “attach a leaf” by the single‑port core construction.
- For Theorem 17, switch to the class‑2 forcing subgraph method and add references for odd D.
- Develop the marker‑based re‑rooting domains and prove they cover a comeagre set; then formalize meagre root‑invariance under these partial homeomorphisms for a broad class of properties.
