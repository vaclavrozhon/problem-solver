Key ingredients: if S is saturated then cl(S) and Int(cl(S)) are saturated (proved by transporting large matching balls and re\u2011rooting), and an equivalent root\u2011free cylinder criterion: S_P is nowhere dense iff every rooted r\u2011ball F admits an extension F' whose cylinder is disjoint from S_P. The meagre half was reduced to an Amb_k strategy: for a nowhere\u2011dense N, Sat_k(N) is covered by countably many homeomorphic images of N plus an ambiguity set Amb_k; the plan is to make each Amb_k meagre using degree\u2011preserving marker (boundary\u2011hub / beacon) gadgets (separate treatments for \u0394\u2264D and \u0394=D, with D=2 exceptional). Also: for D\u22653, Br_\u2264k (bridge within distance \u2264k) is nowhere dense, so \u201chas a 2\u2011way infinite bridge\u201d is meagre but dense. Caveats: forget\u2011the\u2011root quotient need not be open; correct Theorem 4 (needs bridgelessness).
