{"summary_md":"This round settled the nowhere‑density half of the conjecture: for any unrooted property P the rooted set S_P is saturated, and nowhere‑density is root‑invariant. Key ingredients: if S is saturated then cl(S) and Int(cl(S)) are saturated (proved by transporting large matching balls and re‑rooting), and an equivalent root‑free cylinder criterion: S_P is nowhere dense iff every rooted r‑ball F admits an extension F' whose cylinder is disjoint from S_P. The meagre half was reduced to an Amb_k strategy: for a nowhere‑dense N, Sat_k(N) is covered by countably many homeomorphic images of N plus an ambiguity set Amb_k; the plan is to make each Amb_k meagre using degree‑preserving marker (boundary‑hub / beacon) gadgets (separate treatments for Δ≤D and Δ=D, with D=2 exceptional). Also: for D≥3, Br_≤k (bridge within distance ≤k) is nowhere dense, so “has a 2‑way infinite bridge” is meagre but dense. Caveats: forget‑the‑root quotient need not be open; correct Theorem 4 (needs bridgelessness).
