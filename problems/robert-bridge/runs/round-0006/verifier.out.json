  "feedback_md": "Current status: The nowhere-dense (ND) half is now correctly handled via the clopen-cylinder refinement criterion. The Current Output presents a root\u2011free equivalence for ND that is valid and sufficient. Do not rely on Int(cl(S)) being saturated; it is unnecessary and its proof sketch was flawed (re-rooting does not preserve membership in a fixed cylinder).\n\nQuotient caveat: Prover 1 still uses \u03c0(C) open under the forget\u2011the\u2011root map; this is false. The saturation of a cylinder is typically F_sigma, not open (e.g., C = \u201croot degree 1\u201d saturates to \u201chas a leaf somewhere\u201d). Avoid quotient\u2011openness arguments for ND/meagre; work inside the rooted space with cylinders and saturation.\n\nBridges and parity: Correct the scope\u2014no 1\u2011way bridges in any D\u2011regular graph (all D), but 2\u2011way bridges can exist even when D is even (e.g., regular trees). Adjust Theorems 14\u201316 accordingly.\n\nMeagre progress (concrete): For D\u22653, Prover 2\u2019s merger\u2011network method gives a rigorous ND proof for \u201chas a bridge within distance \u2264k,\u201d hence \u201chas a 2\u2011way infinite bridge\u201d is meagre (not ND) as \u22c3_k of ND sets. Ensure \u0394= D completion preserves the inner ball: use the earlier Lemma A that requires all vertices at distance <R have degree D and at least one boundary deficit; Prover 2\u2019s stronger completion lemma (allowing inner deficits) is invalid, as it would alter the prescribed ball. Keep the stronger claim out; stick to the version already added to proofs.md.\n\nTheorem 4: As stated (no 1\u2011way bridge \u21d2 weak 6\u2011flow) is false; the D\u2011regular tree contradicts it. Either retract or restate with a correct bridgeless hypothesis and provide a valid finite satisfiability/compactness route.\n\nNext steps: (i) Integrate the full k\u2011local bridge ND proof (with \u0394= D completion) into proofs.md (already added); (ii) correct parity/scope and replace the \u2018attach a leaf\u2019 gadget by a single\u2011port/hub forcing construction with explicit degree bookkeeping; (iii) remove quotient\u2011openness from arguments; (iv) repair or retract Theorem 4. Broader meagre root\u2011invariance remains open; pursue local re\u2011rooting on a comeagre domain separately.",

Avoid arguments that require \u03c0(C) to be open.\n- Parity and bridges: In D\u2011regular graphs, 1\u2011way bridges do not exist for any D; 2\u2011way bridges can exist even when D is even. Adjust statements and gadgets accordingly.\n- Theorem 4 is false as stated (counterexample: D\u2011regular tree). A correct direction needs a bridgeless assumption and a careful finite satisfiability step.\n\nMeagre result for 2\u2011way bridges (D\u22653)\n- For each k, the set Br_\u2264k (a bridge within distance \u2264k from the root) is nowhere dense by refining beyond a large outer sphere and wiring boundary pairs through a finite merger network so every k\u2011local edge lies on a cycle. In \u0394= D, preserve the inner ball by first saturating all vertices at distance <R to degree D and keeping at least one boundary deficit for completion.\n- Consequently, \u201chas a 2\u2011way infinite bridge\u201d is meagre (countable union of Br_\u2264k) and dense, hence not nowhere dense. This property is saturated, so its meagreness is root\u2011invariant.\n\nCaution on completion lemmas\n- The \u0394= D completion preserving a radius\u2011R ball requires all vertices with distance <R to have degree D within the ball and at least one boundary vertex with spare capacity. A stronger claim allowing inner deficits is invalid (it would alter the R\u2011ball by adding neighbors at distance \u2264R). Use only the saturated\u2011interior version.\n\nNext steps\n- Replace \u2018attach a leaf\u2019 by single\u2011port/hub gadgets with explicit degree bookkeeping; prove cut\u2011vertex forcing similarly. \n- Repair or retract Theorem 4. \n- Continue exploring local re\u2011rooting homeomorphisms on a comeagre domain for broader meagre root\u2011invariance."
