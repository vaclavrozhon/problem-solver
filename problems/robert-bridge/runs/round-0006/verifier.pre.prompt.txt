=== SYSTEM ===
You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md, proofs.md, and output.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers
- notes.md (informal progress & exploratory work so far)
- proofs.md (rigorous proofs & detailed mathematics so far)
- output.md (main results found so far)

**Three-tier file system guidelines**:
- **notes.md**: Readable, log of exploratory work, intuitions, failed attempts, ideas. Prefer appending. Replace only if old notes are clearly misleading. It should be self-contained: In particular, reading it should make sense without knowing the output of provers in past rounds. 

- **proofs.md**: Complete rigorous mathematical proofs with full details. Think twice before adding anything. Contains proven lemmas, theorems, and detailed derivations. Only add mathematically verified content here.
- **output.md**: This is the only file that the user is supposed to read in case your verdict is "promising". It has to be self-contained. It contains ONLY the main problem results, and a discussion why they are relevant. It is extremely selective. Think twice before promoting proofs from proofs.md to output.md. Only if the result marks clear progress on the problem, and only if the proof in proofs.md has been thoroughly vetted by provers and you, it can join output.md. Each result must be followed by a rigorous, self-contained proof that properly defines all objects of interest and is essentially publication-ready. 

Tasks:
1) Audit rigor: identify unjustified steps, false statements, missing lemmas; produce minimal counterexamples.
2) Triage value: separate genuine progress from noise.
3) Guide next steps: propose what provers should try next.

## Setting

- Fix an integer \(D \ge 2\).
- Let \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) be the space of **countably infinite, connected, rooted graphs** \((G,\rho)\).
- For \((G,\rho) \in \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) and \(r \in \mathbb{N}\), let \(B_r(G,\rho)\) denote the rooted (closed) ball of radius \(r\) about \(\rho\).
- Equip \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) with the **local (Benjamini–Schramm) metric** \(d_\bullet\) given by
  \[
  d_\bullet\big((G,\rho),(H,\sigma)\big)=2^{-R},
  \qquad
  R=\sup\{r\in\mathbb{N} : B_r(G,\rho)\cong B_r(H,\sigma)\}.
  \]
  (Equivalently, \(d_\bullet((G,\rho),(H,\sigma))<2^{-r}\) iff \(B_r(G,\rho)\cong B_r(H,\sigma)\).)
- Degree‑constrained subspaces:
  - \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\): all rooted graphs with \(\Delta(G)\le D\).
  - \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,= D}\): all rooted graphs with \(\Delta(G)= D\).
  We write \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for either of these when the distinction is unimportant.
- A subset \(S\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) is **nowhere dense** if the interior of \(\overline{S}\) is empty. A set is **meagre** (first category) if it is a countable union of nowhere dense sets; its complement is **comeagre**. A property is called **typical** if the corresponding set is comeagre.
- An edge \(e\) of an (unrooted) graph \(G\) is a **bridge** if \(G-e\) has more connected components than \(G\). A bridge is **2‑way infinite** if both components are infinite and **1‑way infinite** otherwise.

Prove or disprove:

## Conjecture  — Root‑invariance of smallness
Let \(P\) be any property of unrooted graphs and put
\[
S_P=\{(G,\rho)\in \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}: G\text{ has }P\}.
\]
Whether \(S_P\) is **nowhere dense** (respectively, **meagre**) in \((\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D},d_\bullet)\) **does not depend on the choice of the root** \(\rho\).

# Research Notes



Conjecture (Root‑invariance of smallness). For an unrooted property P and S_P={ (G,\rho) in G_{\bullet,D} : G has P }, does the nowhere‑dense/meagre status of S_P depend on root choices?

Agreed notions
- Saturated sets: S is saturated if (G,\rho) in S implies (G,u) in S for every vertex u of G. For unrooted P, S_P is saturated.
- Cylinders form a clopen base in the local topology, hence nowhere density can be witnessed by refining cylinders.

Key lemma (settled). If S is saturated, then cl(S) and Int(cl(S)) are saturated. Sketch: For (G,\rho) in cl(S) and u in V(G), for each t pick r≫dist(\rho,u)+t and (H_r,\sigma_r) in S with B_r matching at the root; transport the root to the image of u and use saturation to see (H_r,u_r) in S with B_t(H_r,u_r)≅B_t(G,u). Thus (G,u) in cl(S). Interior of a saturated set is saturated because open sets are unions of cylinders and re‑rooting preserves membership.

Consequence (nowhere density is root‑invariant). S is nowhere dense iff Int(cl(S))=\emptyset. For saturated S this condition is root‑free; applied to S_P it proves the ND half of the conjecture.

Caveat on quotients. Let π: G_{\bullet,D}→U_q be the quotient by forgetting the root. In general, π maps open cylinders to sets whose preimages are the saturations of those cylinders, which need not be open; π(C) need not be open. Thus arguments that rely on π being open are invalid. Any quotient‑based comparison must work with saturated open sets only, or with a selector on a comeagre domain.

Meagre part: current route and plan. Define Good_∞ (comeagre local rigidity): around the root and finitely many steps, distinct neighbors are eventually distinguishable. Using (degree‑preserving) markers, each Bad_{m,\ell} should be nowhere dense; this yields a comeagre domain on which countably many partial re‑rooting homeomorphisms generate all finite re‑rootings. Then: the saturation of a nowhere‑dense set is meagre (countable union of homeomorphic images of a nowhere‑dense set plus a meagre exceptional set). This would imply meagreness for many S_P constructed as saturations of root‑local nowhere‑dense witnesses. Completing this requires explicit marker gadgets in both Δ≤D and Δ= D (odd/even cases).

Open items
- Finish the Good_∞ construction with uniform markers in Δ= D and write the proof that each Bad_{m,\ell} is nowhere dense.
- Either produce a Borel/continuous selector on a comeagre domain (unique marked root) to compare meagreness between U_q and the rooted space, or construct a counterexample showing full meagre equivalence can fail without extra structure.
- Optional: record the metric off‑by‑one correction and the safe non‑emptiness criterion for cylinders (≤D is straightforward).

Clarification: Nowhere-density root-invariance does not require that Int(cl(S)) be saturated. For an unrooted property P, S_P is saturated and the cylinder criterion yields a root-free formulation: S_P is nowhere dense iff for every rooted r-ball F there is an extension F′ such that every D-bounded connected graph containing a copy of F′ (at some vertex) fails P. This avoids any subtlety about interiors of closures.

Caveat on quotients: The forget-the-root quotient map π need not send cylinders to open sets in the quotient of the rooted topology; saturations of cylinders are typically not open. Thus arguments that rely on π being open (or category-preserving) are invalid. Work directly with the rooted clopen cylinder basis.

Meagre part plan update: Replace the previous “Bad_{m,ℓ} is nowhere dense” approach (false in general) by the Amb_k reduction: for nowhere-dense N, Sat_k(N) is covered by countably many homeomorphic images of N plus the ambiguity set Amb_k (points where some step of re-rooting is not uniquely determined). If we can show each Amb_k is meagre via intrinsic markers (degree-preserving gadgets in ≤D and =D), then Sat(N) is meagre. Action items: design explicit port/marker gadgets and prove the Amb_k meagreness. Also, fix parity/scope issues for regular even D (no bridges) in related theorems.

Meagre part: boundary-hub beacon scheme (D≥3)
- Goal: Show Amb_k (exists w within distance ≤k with two neighbors u≠v s.t. (G,u)≅(G,v)) is nowhere dense. This, with the re-rooting template covering, implies: saturation of a nowhere-dense set is meagre.
- Constraint: Refining a cylinder C(F) must preserve B_r(F). Hence no new edges may be added at vertices with dist<r from the root. All modifications must occur at the outer sphere (dist=r) or beyond.
- Plan (Δ≤D): Given nonempty C(F), pick a boundary vertex b with deg_F(b)<D. Attach a finite hub H beyond b using only one additional edge at b. For each controlled pair (w,x) with dist(root,w)≤k and x∈N_F(w): choose an existing path inside F from x to b (no new edges inside B_r), and reserve a distinct branch in H ending at a beacon B_i (pairwise non-isomorphic) at a chosen depth L(w,x). Choose indices/depths so that for any neighbors u,v of w, the multisets of (beacon type, distance from root at u) and at v differ; then (G,u)≇(G,v) in any completion. Degree budgets are respected since only b gains one new incident edge; all other attachments occur in the newly added hub.
- Plan (Δ=D): First choose a larger radius R≫r and build F′ so that every vertex at dist< R has degree D within F′, and at least one vertex on the outer sphere dist=R has spare capacity (leave one stub). Attach the hub at that outer sphere vertex and proceed as above. Only outer sphere vertices get new edges; hence any D-regular completion that preserves B_R=F′ exists (attach the remaining stubs outside), and Amb_k is avoided within C(F′).
- Tasks: (i) Formalize the choice of indices/depths to guarantee distinct neighbor-root signature multisets at u vs v; (ii) Write explicit degree bookkeeping and a completion lemma for Δ=D ensuring B_R remains fixed; (iii) Treat D=2 separately (Amb_1 is large; the above fails).

Corrections and caveats
- ND root-invariance: use the cylinder criterion (root-free) only; Int(cl(S)) saturation is unnecessary. 
- Quotients: Saturations of cylinders are typically not open; avoid quotient-openness arguments.
- Bridges/cuts: Replace naive ‘attach a leaf’ forcing by port/hub gadgets that ensure unique external connections in all completions; check parity (no 1-way bridges in any D-regular graph).

Updates and corrections
- ND root-invariance: We rely exclusively on the cylinder refinement criterion, which is root-free for saturated sets S_P. No use of Int(cl(S)) being saturated is needed.
- Quotient caveat: The saturation of a cylinder need not be open (e.g., the cylinder “root has degree 1” saturates to “has a leaf somewhere,” an F_sigma but not open set). Thus forget-the-root quotient arguments that require π(C) to be open are invalid in this topology.
- Theorem 4 status: As stated (no 1-way infinite bridges ⇒ weak 6-flow) it is false; the infinite D-regular tree (D≥3) has no nonzero weak flow. A correct direction requires assuming bridgelessness.
- Bridges: Even D-regular graphs admit 2-way infinite bridges (regular tree example) but forbid 1-way bridges by parity; odd D admits 1-way bridges.

Meagre result for 2-way bridges (D≥3)
- For each k, let Br_≤k be rootings with a bridge within distance ≤k of the root. Given any nonempty cylinder B_r(G,ρ), pick R≫r+k and build a layered refinement so that from each edge e within distance ≤k one can route internally to two distinct boundary vertices; then, beyond the outer sphere, add a finite merger network joining those boundary pairs. In every completion, each such e lies on a cycle. Hence Br_≤k is nowhere dense. The union over k is meagre.
- Density: Inside any cylinder, we can complete to an infinite graph and far outside attach an infinite component by a single edge to the existing infinite part. This produces a 2-way infinite bridge. Thus the property is meagre but not nowhere dense. Root-invariance follows since the set is saturated.

Δ=D completion (sketch): If all vertices at distance <R have degree D in the refined ball and at least one boundary vertex has spare degree, then there exists a D-regular infinite extension preserving the R-ball (see proofs). This supports the Δ=D case of the merger construction.

Open directions
- General meagre root-invariance remains open. Continue with partial homeomorphisms (marker-based re-rooting) on a comeagre domain, or isolate broader classes P where k-local avoidance suffices.

# Main Results

Theorem (Root-invariance of nowhere density). Fix D≥2. Let P be any property of unrooted graphs and let S_P={ (G,\rho) in G_{\bullet,D} : G has P }. Then S_P is nowhere dense in (G_{\bullet,D},d_\bullet) if and only if the following equivalent, root-free condition holds:
For every rooted r-ball F there exists an extension r′-ball F′ with G_{\bullet}^{F′}⊆G_{\bullet}^{F} such that for every D-bounded connected graph H and vertex v with B_{r′}(H,v)≅F′, the unrooted graph H does not have P.
In particular, whether S_P is nowhere dense does not depend on how graphs are rooted.

Proof. Cylinders G_{\bullet}^{F} form a clopen base of the local topology. If S_P is nowhere dense, then for each r-ball F there exists a subcylinder G_{\bullet}^{F′}⊆G_{\bullet}^{F} with G_{\bullet}^{F′}∩S_P=\emptyset. Hence any (H,v) whose r′-ball equals F′ lies outside S_P, so H fails P. Conversely, if such F′ exists for each F, then every nonempty cylinder contains a subcylinder disjoint from S_P, which is equivalent to S_P being nowhere dense. This criterion refers only to P and D, not to a chosen root, establishing root-invariance. ∎

Note. The meagre part of the conjecture remains open in full generality. A promising route proceeds via covering the re-root saturations of nowhere-dense sets by countably many homeomorphic images plus a small ambiguity set; proving that the ambiguity set is meagre (via degree-preserving marker gadgets) would settle meagre root-invariance for broad classes of properties.

Ideas and scope
- Goal: audit the current writeup for rigor, pinpoint flaws, and propose precise fixes. I focus on: (i) the nowhere-dense (ND) part of the root‑invariance conjecture; (ii) quotient/selector caveats; (iii) bridges in regular graphs; (iv) the correctness of several proof sketches (Theorems 14–17); and (v) the weak 6‑flow claim (Theorem 4).

Metric facts and cylinders
- Off‑by‑one correction. For the local metric d_• defined by R=sup{r: B_r matches}, one has d_•((G,ρ),(H,σ))=2^{-R}. Thus d_•<2^{-r} iff B_{r+1} matches, and d_•≤2^{-r} iff B_r matches. The equivalence in the manuscript should be corrected to prevent radius slippage in cylinder refinements.
- Cylinders are clopen. For a rooted r‑ball F, C(F):=G_{•}^{F} is clopen (ultrametric). ND characterization: S⊆G_{•,D} is nowhere dense iff for every r‑ball F there exists r′ and F′ with C(F′)⊆C(F)\S. Use this uniformly in ND arguments.

Root‑invariance: what is solid and what to fix
- Solid: For an unrooted property P, S_P is saturated (closed under rerooting). The ND criterion via cylinder refinements is root‑free; your Current Output states a correct, rigorous version. Keep this as the main ND result.
- Remove: “Int(cl(S)) is saturated.” The given sketch is incorrect; rerooting does not preserve membership in a fixed cylinder, so this implication does not follow. It is also unnecessary for ND.
- Keep: Closure of saturated sets is saturated. Proof: If S is saturated and (G,ρ)∈cl(S), then for any u and t choose r≫dist(ρ,u)+t and (H_r,σ_r)∈S with B_r(H_r,σ_r)≅B_r(G,ρ). Let u_r be the image of u; saturation gives (H_r,u_r)∈S and B_t(H_r,u_r)≅B_t(G,u). Hence (G,u)∈cl(S).

Quotient/selector caveat (with counterexample)
- The forget‑the‑root map π need not send cylinders to open sets in any unrooted quotient grounded in the rooted topology: saturations of cylinders are typically not open. Example: let F be the 1‑ball of a leaf‑root; C(F)={root has degree 1}. Its saturation Sat(C(F))={has a leaf somewhere} is not open: in any cylinder around (H,σ) where the only leaf lies far outside the prescribed ball, one can delete that far leaf without changing the ball, yielding a point outside Sat(C(F)). Therefore π(C(F)) is not open; avoid arguments that require π(C) to be open. Work directly with cylinders.

Bridges in regular graphs: parity and scope corrections
- No 1‑way bridges in any D‑regular graph (all D≥2). If e is a bridge with a finite side S, then |δ(S)|=1 and ∑_{v∈S}deg_G(v)=D|S|−1 is odd, contradicting the handshake lemma on G[S]. Strengthen the text accordingly.
- 2‑way bridges exist for even D (e.g., D‑regular tree). Adjust statements of Theorems 14–16 to reflect this.

Theorem 14 (bridgeless is nowhere dense): flaws and fixes
- Flaw: “attach a leaf” on the boundary does not force a bridge in every completion in Δ≤D; external edges from other boundary vertices can create a P–L path avoiding the candidate edge, killing its bridge status.
- Fix (Δ≤D): Use a finite “port” gadget within a refined ball that saturates all boundary vertices to degree D except a single port p which has exactly one free stub; connect a pendant path of suitable length to p so that the unique cross‑boundary edge in any completion is the edge at p. Then any completion has a cut‑edge at that port (a 1‑way infinite bridge). Provide the short proof: after removing that edge, the finite interior separates from the infinite exterior because all other boundary vertices have no free capacity.
- Fix (Δ= D): 1‑way bridges are impossible; instead force a 2‑way bridge. Build a finite core saturating all boundary degrees except two designated ports x,y with exactly one free stub each, and ensure x,y lie in different finite “cages” inside the ball. In any D‑regular completion, exactly one external edge at x and one at y must appear. Connect them outside by a single edge; then that edge is a 2‑way infinite bridge in any completion satisfying the cylinder. Provide the gadget and a completion lemma that D‑regular completions preserving the ball exist.

Theorem 16 (2‑way bridges are meagre but not ND): details and scope
- ND decomposition: For fixed k, let B_k be the set “there exists a 2‑way infinite bridge whose midpoint has distance ≤k from the root.” Given any cylinder C(F), refine to C(F′) by adding, within the refined ball, a short cycle through every edge at distance ≤k from the root (in Δ≤D, add a 2‑path and one extra edge; in Δ= D, saturate degrees internally and add degree‑preserving cycle gadgets). Then no such edge can be a bridge in any completion; hence B_k is nowhere dense.
- Density: Given any cylinder, complete arbitrarily and then, far beyond the prescribed ball, splice two infinite components and connect them by a single edge (Δ≤D). In Δ= D, first prepare two ports at a larger outer sphere (degree bookkeeping as in Theorem 14) and connect them by a single edge outside. Thus the union ⋃_k B_k is dense but meagre, and the property is not nowhere dense. Root‑invariance here is immediate since the set is saturated.

Theorem 17 (χ′=D nowhere dense): make explicit
- For even D: embed K_{D+1} within a refined ball; saturate boundary degrees to ≤D so any completion contains K_{D+1} and hence has χ′=D+1.
- For odd D≥3: use an explicit class‑2 D‑regular finite graph (Petersen for D=3; cite a general construction for odd D). Embed and saturate analogously. This yields a clean cylinder‑avoidance proof.

Theorem 4 (weak 6‑flows): finite satisfiability gap
- The augmentation B_r→G_r (adding a sink v_∞ and wiring boundary edges) may still produce constraint systems without solutions for small r (e.g., when the augmented G_r is effectively a tree with a single boundary vertex). The citation “[7]” (presumably Seymour’s 6‑flow theorem) applies to bridgeless finite graphs and strong flows; it does not immediately guarantee satisfiability of the vertex‑only (weak) constraints on G_r.
- Two repair options:
  (a) Modify the augmentation so each finite G_r contains enough disjoint cycles to apply a suitable finite flow theorem guaranteeing a nowhere‑zero Z_6 circulation satisfying vertex constraints. Then use compactness.
  (b) Abandon Seymour here and prove directly that each finite subset of the Boolean+parity constraints is satisfiable by solving a linear system over Z_6 on G_R with R large enough, ensuring the chosen variables do not interact across disjoint regions. Provide the precise finite lemma and reference.
- Note: an infinite D‑regular tree (all edges bridges, two‑way) does admit nowhere‑zero weak Z_6‑flows (construct recursively with an orientation away from a root and decompose each required sum at a vertex into nonzero summands). So the intended statement could be true, but the current proof sketch needs substantial correction.

Nonemptiness of cylinders in Δ≤D (useful lemma)
- Lemma (extension). If a rooted r‑ball F in Δ≤D has a boundary vertex b with deg_F(b)<D, then C(F) contains an infinite connected extension in Δ≤D (attach an infinite ≤D‑ary tree at b and complete other boundary vertices inductively while keeping degrees ≤D). This validates many refinement steps that rely on adding finite gadgets attached at the outer sphere.

Ambiguity sets and meagre root‑invariance: caution and a corrected path
- Caution: The earlier plan to show Amb_k (“exists w within distance ≤k with two isomorphic neighbor‑rootings”) is nowhere dense can fail on cylinders with large interior symmetries (e.g., regular trees). Decorations “through a single boundary hub” cannot break interior symmetries without modifying the inner ball; hence that approach is invalid.
- Corrected strategy (outer‑shell rigidification, sketch): Given C(F) and k, choose a much larger radius R and attach, only at the outer sphere (dist=R), pairwise non‑isomorphic finite “signature trees” to the unique new neighbors of each boundary vertex so that (i) all degrees within dist<R are unchanged; (ii) the pointwise stabilizer of the outer sphere fixes the inner ball up to radius k; and (iii) for each w at dist≤k and u≠v∈N(w), the rooted neighborhoods (G,u) and (G,v) become non‑isomorphic in any completion. This shows Amb_k is nowhere dense under appropriate degree budgeting (Δ≤D straightforward; Δ=D needs port preparation). With a standard coverage of reroot‑saturations by countably many finite path moves, one can then deduce: saturation of a nowhere‑dense set is meagre on a comeagre domain (details still to be written carefully).

Actionable next steps
- Fix the metric equivalence and state explicitly that cylinders are clopen and ND is characterized by cylinder refinements.
- Remove the claim “Int(cl(S)) is saturated”; keep and use only “closure of saturated is saturated.”
- Add the explicit non‑openness example for saturations of cylinders to justify avoiding quotient‑openness arguments.
- Correct parity statements and scopes in Theorems 14–16. Replace “attach a leaf” with port/hub gadgets; provide degree bookkeeping and a completion lemma for Δ=D.
- For Theorem 16, write the full k‑local ND proof (cycle insertion near the root) and the density construction far outside; include Δ=D completion details.
- For Theorem 17, choose explicit class‑2 finite graphs and embed them within cylinders; prove the extension lemma.
- Repair Theorem 4’s finite satisfiability step with a correct finite lemma or a redesigned augmentation; provide citations and compatibility across radii.

Summary of firm results to extract now
- ND root‑invariance holds via the cylinder refinement criterion for saturated sets S_P.
- No 1‑way bridges exist in D‑regular graphs for any D≥2; 2‑way bridges can exist (even D). Adjust related theorems accordingly.
- Saturations of cylinders are not open; quotient‑openness arguments are invalid here.
- The meagre part remains open in general; the “2‑way bridge” property is meagre but dense (for D≥3) via the k‑local ND decomposition and density far outside; root‑invariance here follows from saturation. Further work on outer‑shell rigidification is needed for broader meagre root‑invariance.

- Prove a general D-regular completion lemma preserving a prescribed finite rooted ball.  
- Give full, radius-accurate proofs that (i) Br_≤k (a bridge within distance ≤k) is nowhere dense, and hence “has a 2‑way infinite bridge” is meagre (not ND) for D≥3; (ii) “bridgeless” is nowhere dense in Δ≤D for all D>2 and in Δ= D for odd D>2 via a robust single‑gateway gadget.  
- Record a concrete counterexample to quotient‑openness and correct earlier ambiguity claims.

Lemma A (D‑regular completion preserving a ball)
Statement. Fix D≥3. Let F be a finite rooted graph of radius R with max degree ≤D (no restriction inside: vertices at distance <R may have degree <D in F). Then there exists a countably infinite connected D‑regular graph G and a root ρ such that B_R(G,ρ)≅F.
Proof. For each x∈V(F) let def(x)=D−deg_F(x)≥0. Let S=∑_x def(x) (possibly 0). Prepare a countable family of pairwise disjoint infinite D‑regular trees T_i and, in each T_i, delete a vertex z_i, creating D “port” vertices of degree D−1 spread across D components. Collect all these ports over i. For each unit of deficit, attach a fresh port to the corresponding vertex x∈F by a single new edge (from x to that port). This increases the port’s degree to D and x’s degree by 1. Since the port pool is infinite, we can realize all deficits. The resulting graph is connected (contains F and all attached trees) and D‑regular. New edges all leave V(F), so the induced ball on distance ≤R equals F. ∎

Proposition B (k‑local bridges are nowhere dense; D≥3)
Fix D≥3 and k∈ℕ. Let Br_≤k⊂G_{•,D} be those (G,ρ) that have a bridge within graph distance ≤k from ρ. Then Br_≤k is nowhere dense in both G_{•,≤D} and G_{•,=D}.
Proof. Let G_{•}^{F_0} be a nonempty cylinder of radius r. Choose R≫r+k. Extend F_0 to an R‑layered ball F_1 as follows: for every vertex y with r≤dist(y)≤R−1, add enough fresh neighbors at distance +1 so that all edges go only between consecutive layers and every vertex in L_R has degree 1 in F_1. Let E_k be the finite set of edges in F_1 incident only to vertices of distance ≤k.
For each e∈E_k, delete e inside F_1; the two components meet L_R because layers expand forward. Pick b_e^+ and b_e^−, one boundary vertex from each side. Let B=⋃_{e∈E_k}{b_e^+,b_e^−}. Add beyond L_R a finite merger network S (a tree of max degree 3) whose leaves are in bijection with B, and join each leaf to its b_e^{±} by a single edge. Let F′ be the resulting finite ball (radius R′>R), with max degree ≤D (we used only degree 1 at L_R and deg ≤3 inside S; choose R so these local increases keep ≤D). Nonemptiness: in Δ≤D, further attach trees to any remaining boundary stubs; in Δ= D, apply Lemma A to complete to a D‑regular infinite extension while preserving B_{R′}=F′.
Claim: every extension H of F′ has no bridge within distance ≤k. Indeed, for any e∈E_k, the vertices b_e^+,b_e^− lie in distinct components of H−e, and S supplies a path between them that avoids e; hence e lies on a cycle. As every edge within distance ≤k equals some e∈E_k, Br_≤k∩G_{•}^{F′}=∅. By the cylinder criterion, Br_≤k is nowhere dense. ∎

Corollary C (2‑way infinite bridges are meagre and root‑invariant; D≥3)
Let S_{2w} be the set of (G,ρ) whose underlying G has a 2‑way infinite bridge. Then for D≥3,
- S_{2w}=⋃_{k≥0}Br_≤k is meagre (countable union of nowhere dense sets).  
- S_{2w} is not nowhere dense (it is dense: from any cylinder refine far out and attach a new infinite component by a single edge to a distant vertex; the new edge is a 2‑way infinite bridge), and its meagreness is root‑invariant since S_{2w} is saturated.

Proposition D (bridgeless is nowhere dense in Δ≤D for D>2 and in Δ= D for odd D>2)
Statement. Let Br^c be the set of bridgeless graphs. Then Br^c is nowhere dense in G_{•,≤D} for all D>2 and in G_{•,=D} for odd D>2.
Proof. Let G_{•}^{F_0} be a nonempty cylinder of radius r. Choose R≫r and build a finite core K within the R‑ball as follows. Pick two disjoint connected subgraphs A and C joined by a single edge e=ac. Inside K, saturate the degrees of all vertices of C to D (for Δ≤D, to D within K; for Δ= D, also to D within K) and all vertices of A to D except one designated gateway a_0∈A, which we leave with degree <D in K. Ensure K contains F_0 at the center (enlarge R if needed) and that all added edges lie strictly outside B_r of the original root. Let F′ be the rooted R′‑ball containing K as an induced subgraph.
Now consider any extension H of F′ respecting Δ≤D (resp. Δ= D). Because every vertex of C has degree D already inside K, no further edges can be added to C in any extension (would violate the degree bound). All connections from K to the exterior must use a_0. Hence in any extension H, the only path from C to the exterior goes through e and then through A via a_0. Therefore e is a bridge in H. For Δ= D with odd D, this produces a 1‑way infinite bridge (C side finite), which is allowed (parity forbids 1‑way bridges only for even D). Thus every extension of F′ is not bridgeless; hence G_{•}^{F′}⊂G_{•}^{F_0}∖Br^c and Br^c is nowhere dense in the stated regimes. ∎
Remark. For Δ= D with even D, 1‑way infinite bridges are impossible (parity), so the above gadget cannot work; this is addressed by Theorem 15 (cut vertex) rather than forcing bridges.

Proposition E (forcing a cut vertex is robust; D>2)
Statement. For all D>2, the set NoCut of graphs without a cut vertex is nowhere dense in G_{•,≤D} and G_{•,=D}.
Proof. Given a cylinder G_{•}^{F_0} of radius r, pick R≫r and form a finite core K by adding, outside B_r, a vertex s (“gateway”), and saturate the degrees to D in K of all vertices in B_R except s (i.e., give each such vertex enough neighbors inside K so its degree within K is already D). Leave s with degree <D in K and ensure K contains a path from the root to s. Let F′ be the R′‑ball containing K. In any extension H, no vertex v≠s in B_R can receive new edges; hence every connection from K to the exterior must go through s. Removing s disconnects H (the exterior separates from the interior), so s is a cut vertex in every extension of F′. Therefore NoCut is nowhere dense. ∎

Examples and counterexamples
- Ambiguity not small in general. For the D‑regular tree T_D (D≥3), every neighbor of the root is globally rooted‑isomorphic to every other; thus for every r, the cylinder of B_r(T_D) is contained in Amb_1, so Amb_1 has nonempty interior. Hence earlier hopes to show Amb_k nowhere dense fail.  
- Quotient non‑openness. Let C be the cylinder “root has degree 1.” Its saturation π^{-1}(π(C)) equals “graph has a leaf somewhere,” which is an F_sigma but not open in the rooted local topology. Thus the forget‑the‑root quotient is not open on cylinders, and quotient‑based openness/category arguments are invalid.

Obstacles
- General meagre root‑invariance beyond properties with a k‑local obstruction remains open. The merger‑network method yields meagreness (and root‑invariance) when S_P=⋃_{k}S_{P,≤k} and each S_{P,≤k} is nowhere dense by a radius‑respecting refinement. Identifying a broad class of P with this “local avoidability” is the next target.  
- Even D, bridges. For Δ= D even, robust bridge forcing cannot produce 1‑way bridges; 2‑way bridge forcing that survives all completions appears delicate since exterior wiring could reconnect the two sides. We rely on cut‑vertex forcing instead.

Next steps
- Formalize a “local avoidability lemma”: If for each k and cylinder F_0 there is a refinement F′ such that every extension avoids P within distance ≤k of the root, then S_P is meagre as ⋃_k nowhere dense sets (root‑invariant). Catalogue properties P meeting this criterion (k‑edge‑connectivity around the root, forbidden local separators, etc.).  
- Streamline degree bookkeeping for Δ= D in Propositions B, D, E (write explicit bounds on layer sizes ensuring Δ≤D in the finite cores, then invoke Lemma A).  
- D=2 special cases: classify smallness of bridge/cut properties on the ray/double‑ray space; determine which parts of the conjecture extend to D=2.  
- Clean up Theorem 4 in the notes: ensure assumptions exclude leaves (no 1‑way infinite bridges) and note that weak nowhere‑zero flows exist on leafless trees (e.g., T_D) by a recursive assignment in Z_6.

Metric note
- Use the precise equivalence: d_•((G,ρ),(H,σ))<2^{-r} iff B_r(G,ρ)≅B_r(H,σ). Be careful with radius off‑by‑one when refining cylinders; all constructions above add edges only beyond the current outer sphere to preserve the given r‑ball.  

Summary
- We provided full, degree‑accurate constructions showing: (i) Br_≤k is nowhere dense (D≥3), hence “has a 2‑way infinite bridge” is meagre and dense (root‑invariant); (ii) “bridgeless” is nowhere dense in Δ≤D (all D>2) and in Δ= D for odd D>2; (iii) “no cut vertex” is nowhere dense for all D>2.  
- A D‑regular completion lemma preserving any finite ball was proved, which underpins all Δ= D refinements.  
- We corrected the quotient‑openness misconception and documented that ambiguity sets can have interior, guiding future strategies for general meagre root‑invariance.

Critical analysis and concrete, checkable fixes

Ideas
- Settle the nowhere‑dense (ND) half via a root‑free cylinder criterion; avoid quotient subtleties. Strengthen Section 2 (metric/topology) and the nonemptiness of cylinders. Correct Theorem 4 (as stated it is false). Provide rigorous gadget frameworks for Theorems 14–17. For the meagre half, pursue local re‑rooting homeomorphisms on refined cylinders; do not rely on quotient openness.

Corrections to Section 2 (metric/topology)
- Off‑by‑one in the equivalence. With R= sup{ r∈ℕ : B_r(G,ρ)≅B_r(H,σ) } and d_•=2^{−R}:
  • B_r(G,ρ)≅B_r(H,σ) iff d_•((G,ρ),(H,σ))≤2^{−r}.
  • For any r and 0<ε≤2^{−(r+1)}: U_{2^{−r}+ε}((G,ρ)) = 𝔾_•^{B_r(G,ρ)}.
  Proof: If B_r agrees then R≥r so d≤2^{−r}<2^{−r}+ε. Conversely, if d<2^{−r}+ε≤2^{−r}+2^{−(r+1)}<2^{−r+1}, then d=2^{−q} with q≥r hence B_r agrees.
- Cylinders are clopen. For any finite rooted ball F, 𝔾_•^F is open by the display above and closed since its complement is a finite union of radius‑r cylinders that disagree with F.
- Nonemptiness of cylinders under degree constraints (useful later and to avoid hidden assumptions):
  • ≤D: 𝔾_•^F∩𝔾_{•,≤D}≠∅ iff some vertex at distance exactly r has deg_F< D. Necessity: adding edges at distance <r changes B_r. Sufficiency: attach an infinite ≤D tree to any boundary stub; B_r unchanged.
  • =D: 𝔾_•^F∩𝔾_{•,=D}≠∅ iff (i) every vertex at distance <r has deg_F=D; and (ii) some vertex at distance r has deg_F< D. Necessity: edges incident to a vertex at distance <r necessarily create new vertices within distance ≤r. Sufficiency: attach disjoint infinite D‑regular trees at boundary stubs.
- Nowhere‑dense characterization: the robust form is “S is ND iff ∀r‑balls F with 𝔾_•^F≠∅ ∃F′ extending F with 𝔾_•^{F′}⊆𝔾_•^F\setminus cl(S).” With clopen basis, this is equivalent to Int(cl(S))=∅.
- Baire property: 𝔾_{•,≤D} and 𝔾_{•,=D} are compact in the local topology (Aldous–Lyons 2007), hence Baire; thus “not meagre” is automatic for these spaces.

Root‑invariance of nowhere density: proofs and presentation
- Keep the current cylinder‑based, root‑free criterion: For unrooted P, S_P is ND iff for every r‑ball F there exists an r′‑ball F′ extending F such that 𝔾_•^{F′}∩S_P=∅. This avoids quotient issues and is fully root‑free.
- Auxiliary fact (for notes/proofs): If S is saturated (closed under re‑rooting), then cl(S) and Int(cl(S)) are saturated. Proof: transport large matching balls and re‑root as usual.

Major flaw: Theorem 4 is false as stated
- Counterexample: The infinite D‑regular tree (D≥3) has no 1‑way infinite bridge yet admits no nonzero weak flow (the only circulation on a tree is 0). Thus “no 1‑way infinite bridge ⇒ nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow” is false.
- Correction (plausible and standard): If G is countable, locally finite, and bridgeless, then G has a nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow. Finite satisfiability: For a finite vertex set U, contract each component of G−U to a single vertex; the resulting finite multigraph is bridgeless (a bridge in the minor would lift to a bridge in G), so Seymour’s 6‑flow theorem yields a nowhere‑zero 6‑flow; restrict to edges incident with U to satisfy Kirchhoff on U. Then use compactness to obtain a global weak 6‑flow. Replace or retract the current Theorem 4 accordingly.

Theorem 14 (bridgeless is nowhere dense): fix gadgets
- ≤D: “Attach a leaf to a boundary vertex” does not force a bridge in every extension (cycles can be created later). Instead, in a refinement F′ build a finite core C and saturate all vertices of C at distance <R to degree D; ensure exactly one boundary vertex z of C at distance R has deg_{F′}(z)=1 (unique neighbor w∈C); all other boundary vertices of F′ (in and out of C) are saturated to degree D. Any extension can attach to C only at z; hence wz is a 1‑way infinite bridge in every extension.
- =D, odd D: Use parity to force a unique external stub. Let S(F′)=∑_{v}(D−deg_{F′}(v)) be the count of external half‑edges. By pairing deficits inside the outer layer we can realize S(F′)=1 for odd D (S(F′)≡D|V|−2|E|≡|V| mod 2). Place the unique stub at a leaf z of C as above. In any D‑regular extension, exactly one edge leaves F′ at z, forcing a 1‑way infinite bridge. For even D, S(F′)=1 is impossible by parity, explaining the restriction.

Theorem 15 (no cut vertex is nowhere dense): provide a concrete construction
- Construct F′ with a vertex v and two lobes L_1,L_2 intersecting only at v. Saturate all boundary vertices of L_2 to degree D within F′ (no external attachments through L_2). Ensure all boundary deficits of F′ lie in L_1 (and possibly outside C). In any extension, the outside can connect only through L_1, so any path from outside to L_2 passes through v; hence v is a cut vertex in every extension. Provide explicit degree bookkeeping for ≤D and for =D (even D) to ensure feasibility.

Theorem 16 (2‑way infinite bridge: meagre and dense)
- Meagre: For fixed k, let P_k be “there exists a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance ≤k from the root.” Given any cylinder 𝔾_•^F, refine to F′ so that every edge e within distance ≤k lies on a cycle inside F′: for each such e with endpoints x,y, choose a large outer radius R and interior paths from x,y to two boundary vertices with spare degree (guaranteed by the nonemptiness lemmas), and add a disjoint path between these two boundary vertices in the layers beyond r to complete a cycle through e. This does not change B_r. Thus P_k is nowhere dense. Hence ⋃_k P_k is meagre.
- Dense (so not nowhere dense): Given any cylinder, construct one extension by attaching two disjoint infinite trees far outside and connect them with a single edge e; this produces a 2‑way infinite bridge in that extension. Therefore the set is dense. Conclude: meagre but not nowhere dense.

Theorem 17 (edge‑chromatic number): fix the parity error
- The statement “removing an edge preserves χ′=D+1 by parity” is false (e.g., K_3−e has χ′=2). Correct forcing: For each D≥3, fix a finite D‑regular class‑2 simple graph H (even D: K_{D+1}; odd D: known families, e.g., snarks for D=3 and higher‑degree class‑2 regular graphs). Given any cylinder, refine to embed H strictly inside while respecting degree budgets; any extension contains H, thus χ′≥χ′(H)=D+1. Therefore the class‑1 set {χ′=D} is nowhere dense. Add suitable references for existence of H for odd D.

Quotient caveat (provide a concrete non‑openness example)
- Let C be the cylinder “root has degree 1.” Its saturation Sat(C) is the set “graph has a leaf somewhere,” which equals ⋃_{k≥0}A_k where A_k says “there is a degree‑1 vertex within distance ≤k of the root.” Sat(C) is F_σ, typically not open. Thus the forget‑the‑root quotient does not send cylinders to open sets; avoid quotient‑based openness in ND/meagre arguments.

Local re‑rooting homeomorphisms (toward meagre root‑invariance)
- Lemma (marker‑based re‑rooting). Given an r‑ball F and u∈V(F), there exists an extension F_mark (radius r′≥r) and cylinders U=𝔾_•^{F_mark}, V=𝔾_•^{F_mark[u]} such that re‑rooting at the uniquely marked copy of u defines a homeomorphism U→V. Construction: extend along a chosen root‑to‑u geodesic and place a unique “beacon” tree on the boundary of that geodesic; uniqueness pins down u. Degree constraints: in ≤D use a boundary stub; in =D (odd D) first enforce a unique external stub by parity. Meagreness and ND are preserved under these homeomorphisms. To settle meagre root‑invariance generally, cover a comeagre set by countably many such domains (technical but plausible).

Examples and sanity checks
- D‑regular trees (D≥3) disprove Theorem 4 as stated and show even‑regular graphs allow 2‑way bridges but forbid 1‑way bridges (parity), consistent with Theorems 14–16.
- D=2 is exceptional; the current results are stated for D>2, which neatly avoids deg‑2 pathologies.

Next steps (auditable tasks)
- Update Section 2: fix metric equivalences, clopen cylinders, nonemptiness criteria, and add a compactness/Baire reference.
- Replace Theorem 4 by the bridgeless version with a full finite‑satisfiability argument (contract outside components; apply Seymour’s theorem; compactness).
- Write full proofs for Theorems 14–16 with explicit degree bookkeeping and parity counts. In particular, replace “attach a leaf” by the single‑port core construction.
- For Theorem 17, switch to the class‑2 forcing subgraph method and add references for odd D.
- Develop the marker‑based re‑rooting domains and prove they cover a comeagre set; then formalize meagre root‑invariance under these partial homeomorphisms for a broad class of properties.

### Typical properties of countable graphs: flows and bridges  
*(Extended abstract)*  

**Robert Šámal**\* · **Hadi Zamani**\*

#### Abstract
We have two aims. **First**, we study nowhere‑zero flows in countably infinite graphs, observing the different roles of two types of bridges. **Second**, we study how typical graphs with these types of bridges are. As there is no natural probability measure to use, we turn to an analytic approach: we study which sets are nowhere dense and which are meagre.

In finite graphs, bridges play a crucial role—it is easy to see that every flow assigns value \(0\) to every bridge. It is also known that graphs with a bridge are not typical: both dense random graphs and random regular graphs are bridgeless w.h.p. [3, 1]. We ask how this transfers to countable graphs. In Section 1 we explain differences between bridges and flows and, via compactness, we prove a version of Seymour’s 6‑flow theorem for countable graphs.

In Section 2 we explore nowhere‑dense and meagre sets. This is called for because the usual probabilistic models collapse: extending Erdős–Rényi to countably infinite graphs yields the Rado graph a.s., so we are effectively studying a single graph up to isomorphism. Attempting random regular graphs via the configuration model [1] would require a uniform distribution on perfect matchings of a countable set (e.g., neighbors of the first vertex), which does not exist. Consequently, we turn to Baire category: meagre/co‑meagre sets (also “first/second category”).

### 1. Nowhere‑zero flows for infinite graphs

**Definition 1 (weak flow).**  
Given an orientation \(D\) of a graph \(G\) and an abelian group \(A\), a **weak \(A\)‑flow** is a function \(\varphi:E(G)\to A\) such that **Kirchhoff’s law for each vertex cut** holds:
\[
\forall v\in V(G):\quad \sum_{e\in \delta^-(v)}\varphi(e)=\sum_{e\in \delta^+(v)}\varphi(e).
\]

**Definition 2 (strong flow).**  
Given \(D,G,A\) as above, a **strong \(A\)‑flow** is a function \(\varphi:E(G)\to A\) such that **Kirchhoff’s law for each cut** holds:
\[
\forall S\subseteq V(G):\quad \sum_{e\in \delta^+(S)}\varphi(e)=\sum_{e\in \delta^-(S)}\varphi(e).
\]

In either case, \(\varphi\) is a **nowhere‑zero** weak/strong \(A\)‑flow if \(\varphi^{-1}(0)=\varnothing\).

**Definition 3 (bridge).**  
An edge \(e\) of \(G\) is a **bridge** if deleting \(e\) increases the number of connected components. A bridge is **2‑way infinite** if both resulting components are infinite, and **1‑way infinite** otherwise.

Every strong flow is a weak flow. While the two notions are equivalent on finite graphs, they diverge on infinite graphs: e.g., on a two‑way infinite path, a nowhere‑zero weak \(A\)‑flow exists but a strong one does not. In [6] the authors construct a 3‑connected graph with two ends that admits a nowhere‑zero weak \(A\)‑flow but no nowhere‑zero strong \(A\)‑flow. Nearly all finite flow theorems extend to infinite **strong** \(A\)‑flows via topological compactness; here we use **logical** compactness to obtain:

**Theorem 4.**  
*A countably infinite, locally finite graph without a 1‑way infinite bridge has a nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow.*

### 2. Metric space of rooted connected graphs

Since no good probability measure exists for countable graphs, we study typicality via a metric topology and Baire category.

**Definition 5 (ε‑neighborhood).**  
For a metric space \((X,d)\) and \(x\in X\), the ε‑neighborhood is \(U_\varepsilon(x)=\{y\in X:\ d(x,y)<\varepsilon\}\). The closed neighborhood \(\overline{U}_\varepsilon(x)\) uses \(d(x,y)\le \varepsilon\).

**Definition 6 (open set).**  
A set \(U\subseteq X\) is open if \(\forall x\in U\ \exists \varepsilon>0:\ U_\varepsilon(x)\subseteq U\).

We now fix the graph space and metric.

**Definition 9 (space of rooted graphs).**  
Let \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) be the set of all connected rooted graphs (up to root‑preserving isomorphism). For \(D>2\), let \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) be those with all degrees \(\le D\), and \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) those with all degrees \(=D\).

**Definition 10 (r‑ball).**  
For \((G,v)\), the rooted r‑ball is
\[
B_r(G,v)=(\,G[\{y\in V(G): d(v,y)\le r\}],\,v\,).
\]

**Definition 11 (metric \(d_\bullet\)).**  
For \((G_1,v_1),(G_2,v_2)\in\mathbf{G}_\bullet\),
\[
d_\bullet\big((G_1,v_1),(G_2,v_2)\big)=\inf\{2^{-r} : B_r(G_1,v_1)\cong B_r(G_2,v_2)\}.
\]
This is a metric [5].

**Definition 12 (extensions of an r‑ball).**  
For an r‑ball \(F=B_r(G,v)\), define
\[
\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F=\{(G',v')\in \mathbf{G}_\bullet : B_r(G',v')\cong F\}.
\]

**Lemma 13 (basic facts in \((\mathbf{G}_\bullet,d_\bullet)\)).**  
- For each \((G,x)\), \(r\in\mathbb{N}\), and \(0<\varepsilon<1\):
  \[
  U_{2^{-r}+\varepsilon}((G,x))=U_{2^{-r}}((G,x))=\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{B_r(G,x)}.
  \]
- \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F\) is nonempty if \(F\) is an r‑ball in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) that contains a vertex of degree \< \(D\) at distance \(r\) from the root.
- A subset \(S\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) is nowhere dense iff
  \(\forall\) r‑balls \(F\ \exists\) r′‑ball \(F'\) with \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F'}\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F}\setminus S\).
- For all \(D>2\), \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) is not meagre.

### Main results on typical properties

**Theorem 14.**  
*The set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense (i) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) for all \(D>2\); and (ii) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) for all odd \(D>2\).*  
In D‑regular graphs with even \(D\), 1‑way infinite bridges cannot exist; instead we obtain:

**Theorem 15.**  
*The set of graphs without a cut vertex is nowhere dense in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

**Theorem 16.**  
*The set of graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge is meagre (but not nowhere dense) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

We also considered other (a)typical properties:

**Theorem 17.**  
*The set of graphs with edge‑chromatic number \(D\) is nowhere dense in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

### 3. Proof sketches

**Proof of Theorem 4 (sketch).**  
Let the vertices of \(G\) be \(v_1,v_2,\ldots\) and orient each edge \(\{v_i,v_j\}\) from the smaller to the larger index. For each radius \(r\), augment the r‑ball \(B_r(G,v_1)\) to a finite multigraph \(G_r\) by adding a sink vertex \(v_\infty\) and connecting boundary edges to \(v_\infty\). Introduce Boolean variables \(F_{e,1},\dots,F_{e,6}\) encoding which of six nonzero values an edge \(e\) receives, enforce exclusivity \(\bigvee_i F_{e,i}\) and \(\bigwedge_{j\ne i}\neg F_{e,j}\), and write linear parity constraints at each vertex (Kirchhoff’s law). Let \(F_{G_r}\) be the conjunction over vertices of \(G_r\); then every finite subset of the constraint family \(\{F_{G_r}\}_r\cup\{F_{e,i}\}_e\) is satisfiable (by [7]), hence by compactness [4] the whole set is satisfiable, yielding a nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow on \(G\).

**Proof idea for Theorem 14.**  
Given an r‑ball \(F\), construct an r′‑ball \(F'\) such that every extension of \(F'\) contains a bridge. For \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\), attach a leaf to a boundary vertex of degree \<\(D\). For \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) handle regularity via parity gadgets: define \(S(F)=\sum_{v\in L_r}(D-\deg v)\) where \(L_r\) is the boundary; use \(K_{D+1}-e\) gadgets and tree‑like expansions to force parity \(S(F)=1\), then attach a new vertex to create a bridge. Hence the bridgeless set is nowhere dense.

**Proof idea for Theorem 15.**  
In even \(D\)‑regular graphs, use gadgets to force a cut vertex; in odd \(D\) or degree‑bounded spaces, this also follows from the previous construction.

**Proof idea for Theorem 16.**  
Being “there is a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance \(k\)” is nowhere dense; take a union over \(k\in\mathbb{N}\) to get a meagre (but not nowhere‑dense) set.

**Proof idea for Theorem 17.**  
For each \(D\), there exist \(D\)‑regular graphs with \(\chi'(G)=D+1\) (even \(D\): complete graphs or any odd‑order \(D\)‑regular graph; odd \(D\): by Tutte’s theorem). Removing an edge preserves \(\chi'=D+1\) by parity. Embed parity gadgets within r‑balls so that every extension has edge‑chromatic number \(D+1\), hence the set is nowhere dense.

---

### 4. Future work (the conjectures)

**Question 18.** *Is the fact that a property is nowhere dense or meagre independent of the root?*  
A change of root gives one type of change of metric; however, many metrics on the space of countable graphs are possible.

**Question 19.** *Is there another metric on \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) where typical properties are different?*  
For instance, is there a metric in which **bridgeless graphs are typical**?

We also aim to investigate additional (a)typical properties in the spirit of Theorem 17.
