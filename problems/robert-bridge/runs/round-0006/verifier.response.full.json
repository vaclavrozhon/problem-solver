The saturation of a cylinder is typically F_sigma, not open (e.g., C = \u201croot degree 1\u201d saturates to \u201chas a leaf somewhere\u201d).

Keep the stronger claim out; stick to the version already added to proofs.md.\\n\\nTheorem 4: As stated (no 1\u2011way bridge \u21d2 weak 6\u2011flow) is false; the D\u2011regular tree contradicts it.

This property is saturated, so its meagreness is root\u2011invariant.\\n\\nCaution on completion lemmas\\n- The \u0394= D completion preserving a radius\u2011R ball requires all vertices with distance <R to have degree D within the ball and at least one boundary vertex with spare capacity.
