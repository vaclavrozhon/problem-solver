{"feedback_md":"Current status: The nowhere-dense (ND) half is now correctly handled via the clopen-cylinder refinement criterion. The Current Output presents a root‑free equivalence for ND that is valid and sufficient. Do not rely on Int(cl(S)) being saturated; it is unnecessary and its proof sketch was flawed (re-rooting does not preserve membership in a fixed cylinder).\n\nQuotient caveat: Prover 1 still uses π(C) open under the forget‑the‑root map; this is false. The saturation of a cylinder is typically F_sigma, not open (e.g., C = “root degree 1” saturates to “has a leaf somewhere”). Avoid quotient‑openness arguments for ND/meagre; work inside the rooted space with cylinders and saturation.\n\nBridges and parity: Correct the scope—no 1‑way bridges in any D‑regular graph (all D), but 2‑way bridges can exist even when D is even (e.g., regular trees). Adjust Theorems 14–16 accordingly.\n\nMeagre progress (concrete): For D≥3, Prover 2’s merger‑network method gives a rigorous ND proof for “has a bridge within distance ≤k,” hence “has a 2‑way infinite bridge” is meagre (not ND) as ⋃_k of ND sets. Ensure Δ= D completion preserves the inner ball: use the earlier Lemma A that requires all vertices at distance <R have degree D and at least one boundary deficit; Prover 2’s stronger completion lemma (allowing inner deficits) is invalid, as it would alter the prescribed ball. Keep the stronger claim out; stick to the version already added to proofs.md.\n\nTheorem 4: As stated (no 1‑way bridge ⇒ weak 6‑flow) is false; the D‑regular tree contradicts it. Either retract or restate with a correct bridgeless hypothesis and provide a valid finite satisfiability/compactness route.\n\nNext steps: (i) Integrate the full k‑local bridge ND proof (with Δ= D completion) into proofs.md (already added); (ii) correct parity/scope and replace the ‘attach a leaf’ gadget by a single‑port/hub forcing construction with explicit degree bookkeeping; (iii) remove quotient‑openness from arguments; (iv) repair or retract Theorem 4.

Avoid arguments that require π(C) to be open.\n- Parity and bridges: In D‑regular graphs, 1‑way bridges do not exist for any D; 2‑way bridges can exist even when D is even. Adjust statements and gadgets accordingly.\n- Theorem 4 is false as stated (counterexample: D‑regular tree). A correct direction needs a bridgeless assumption and a careful finite satisfiability step.\n\nMeagre result for 2‑way bridges (D≥3)\n- For each k, the set Br_≤k (a bridge within distance ≤k from the root) is nowhere dense by refining beyond a large outer sphere and wiring boundary pairs through a finite merger network so every k‑local edge lies on a cycle. In Δ= D, preserve the inner ball by first saturating all vertices at distance <R to degree D and keeping at least one boundary deficit for completion.\n- Consequently, “has a 2‑way infinite bridge” is meagre (countable union of Br_≤k) and dense, hence not nowhere dense. This property is saturated, so its meagreness is root‑invariant.\n\nCaution on completion lemmas\n- The Δ= D completion preserving a radius‑R ball requires all vertices with distance <R to have degree D within the ball and at least one boundary vertex with spare capacity. A stronger claim allowing inner deficits is invalid (it would alter the R‑ball by adding neighbors at distance ≤R). Use only the saturated‑interior version.\n\nNext steps\n- Replace ‘attach a leaf’ by single‑port/hub gadgets with explicit degree bookkeeping; prove cut‑vertex forcing similarly. \n- Repair or retract Theorem 4. \n- Continue exploring local re‑rooting homeomorphisms on a comeagre domain for broader meagre root‑invariance."},"proofs_update":null,"output_update":null}
