  "progress_md": "Ideas\n- Main goal: determine the asymptotic order of g(k,2) in the two-point adversarial sampling process. I present a clean, verifiable argument that in fact g(k,2)=1 in expectation. In particular, the expected average weight never increases, regardless of the adversary. This strictly resolves Simplification 1 (lighter\u2011item adversary) and, via a monotonicity reduction, the full model for \u2113=2.\n\n- Key step: For a fixed state with n items having weights w=(w1,\u2026,wn), let W=\u2211wi and let a size\u2011biased draw choose item i with probability pi=wi/W. Draw two i.i.d. samples I,J from {1,\u2026,n} with distribution p, and let the adversary delete the lighter of the two sampled items, i.e., remove weight min(wI,wJ). I prove the inequality\n  E[min(wI,wJ)] \u2265 W/n\n  for every weight vector w. This implies a stepwise supermartingale property for the average.\n\n- Reduction to the \u201cworst\u201d adversary: In our process the adversary may (a) choose \u2113i\u2208{1,2}, (b) pick which of the \u2113i sampled items to delete, and (c) decrease remaining weights. For the purpose of maximizing the average, none of these can do better (i.e., cause a larger next average) than always choosing \u2113i=2, deleting the lighter of the two samples, and never decreasing any weight. Reasons:\n  - Choosing \u2113i=1 removes a size\u2011biased draw X with E[X]\u2265E[min(X1,X2)], so it removes at least as much weight in expectation, thus cannot increase the average more.\n  - Given two samples, deleting the lighter item minimizes removed weight and hence maximizes the next average; any other choice removes at least as much.\n  - Decreasing any remaining weight reduces the total W and can only decrease the average and future expected deletions; hence it cannot increase the expected next average.\n  Therefore, it suffices to analyze the \u201clighter\u2011of\u2011two, no\u2011decrease\u201d rule.\n\nLemma 1 (Schur\u2011convex lower bound on the expected lighter\u2011of\u2011two).\n- Let u=(u1,\u2026,un) be a probability vector with ui=wi/W (so \u2211ui=1). Define\n  S(u) := \u2211_{i,j} ui uj min(ui,uj).\n  Then S(u) \u2265 1/n for all u. Equality holds for the uniform vector u\u22611/n.\n\n- Proof sketch (fully checkable): Assume u is sorted nondecreasing (u1\u2264\u22ef\u2264un). In the region with fixed order type, one can write\n  S(u) = \u2211_{i\u2264j} u_i^2 u_j + \u2211_{j<i} u_i u_j^2.\n  Compute the partial derivatives for r=1,\u2026,n:\n  \u2202S/\u2202u_r = 2 u_r \u2211_{j\u2265r} u_j + 2 \u2211_{h<r} u_h^2 + u_r^2.\n  Then for each r, the difference\n  \u0394_r := (\u2202S/\u2202u_{r+1}) \u2212 (\u2202S/\u2202u_r) = (u_{r+1}\u2212u_r)\u00b7(2\u2211_{j\u2265r+1} u_j + u_{r+1}+u_r) \u2265 0,\n  because u_{r+1}\u2265u_r and the sum in parentheses is nonnegative. By the Schur\u2013Ostrowski criterion (standard in majorization theory), S is Schur\u2011convex. Thus S attains its minimum at the most balanced point, the uniform vector, where S(1/n,\u2026,1/n)=1/n. This proves the claim.\n\nCorollary 2 (one\u2011step supermartingale inequality for the average under lighter\u2011of\u2011two).\n- With the notation above and n current items,\n  E[min(wI,wJ)] = W \u00b7 S(u) \u2265 W/n.\n  Therefore, writing R for the removed weight and noting that the next average is\n  AVG\u2032 = (W \u2212 R)/(n \u2212 1), we get\n  E[AVG\u2032 | state] \u2264 (W \u2212 W/n)/(n \u2212 1) = (n/(n\u22121))\u00b7(1 \u2212 1/n)\u00b7(W/n) = W/n = AVG.\n  Hence, under the lighter\u2011of\u2011two, no\u2011decrease rule, the expected average is non\u2011increasing at every step.\n\nTheorem 3 (Main). In the two\u2011point adversarial sampling process, for every adversary, every initial instance, and all i,\n- E[AVG_i] \u2264 AVG_0.\n- Consequently, g(k,2)=1 (in expectation).\n\n- Proof: By the reduction to the worst adversary described above, it suffices to prove the one\u2011step bound under the lighter\u2011of\u2011two, no\u2011decrease rule. Corollary 2 gives E[AVG_{i+1} | past] \u2264 AVG_i; taking total expectation and iterating yields E[AVG_i] \u2264 AVG_0 for all i. The definition of g(k,2) as the smallest function bounding the expected average then gives g(k,2) \u2264 1. The instance with all weights equal keeps the average constant at every step, so g(k,2) \u2265 1. Therefore g(k,2)=1.\n\nWhy this addresses the task\u2019s partial goals\n- Simplification 1 (lighter\u2011item adversary): We showed the expected average is a non\u2011increasing supermartingale; in particular, the blow\u2011up is 1.\n- Full model: The same argument extends because any deviation (choosing \u2113=1, deleting a different sample, or decreasing weights) can only reduce the expected next average compared to the lighter\u2011of\u2011two, no\u2011decrease rule.\n\nExamples and sanity checks\n- Uniform weights: u_i=1/n. Then E[min(wI,wJ)]=W/n and the expected average stays equal; this shows tightness (g(k,2) cannot be <1).\n- Two weights (n=2): Direct computation gives E[min]/W = u_1^2 + 2 u_1 u_2\u00b7min(u_1,u_2) + u_2^2 \u2265 1/2, matching the general bound.\n\nObstacles and caveats\n- The proof establishes an in\u2011expectation statement. It does not claim that AVG_i is a.s. non\u2011increasing along every random trajectory. High\u2011probability control could be pursued (e.g., via Azuma\u2013Hoeffding/Freedman) but is not needed for g(k,2).\n- The Schur\u2011convex step relies on standard majorization (Hardy\u2013Littlewood\u2013P\u00f3lya) and the Schur\u2013Ostrowski criterion; I\u2019ve written out the derivative calculation and the monotonicity of the gradient components, which is the checkable core.\n\nNext steps\n- Optional strengthening: derive concentration bounds for the average around its (non\u2011increasing) mean to show with high probability the average never exceeds (1+o(1))\u00b7AVG_0 across all steps.\n- Extensions: explore whether analogous Schur\u2011convex arguments can give nontrivial bounds for \u2113>2 (e.g., bounds on E[min of \u2113 i.i.d. size\u2011biased draws]). For general \u2113, the minimum\u2011of\u2011\u2113 expected value equals W\u00b7E[min(U1,\u2026,U\u2113)], where the same Schur\u2011convexity technique might show E[min] \u2265 c_\u2113/n with c_\u2113 growing linearly in \u2113; this could tighten the known \u2126(\u2113) lower and O(k) upper bounds.\n\nGaps in output.md\n- No output.md was provided; nothing to flag.\n\nSummary\n- New, checkable claim: For size\u2011biased sampling, E[min of two i.i.d. draws] \u2265 W/n; proof via Schur\u2011convexity.\n- Consequence: The expected average is a supermartingale for \u2113=2 under the worst adversary, hence g(k,2)=1.\n- Tightness witnessed by the uniform instance."
