  "content": "Ideas\n- We list graph classes that (for all weights consistent with the class and all biases h) guarantee existence of a pure Nash equilibrium (PNE) in signed network coordination (SNC) games with binary actions.\n- We also state a constructive new class (acyclic dependency digraphs) and an SCC-wise decomposition result. Finally, we recall \u201ccohesive core\u201d conditions ensuring existence with a specific structure of the equilibrium.\n\nModel reminder\n- Players i \u2208 V choose x_i \u2208 {\u00b11}. Payoffs u_i(x) = h_i x_i + x_i \u2211_j W_{ij} x_j.\n- Directed signed graph: (i,j) \u2208 E \u21d4 W_{ij} \u2260 0. Player i\u2019s payoff depends on her out-neighbors j (the j with W_{ij} \u2260 0).\n\nResults (statements and succinct proofs)\n1) Undirected networks (W = W\u2032)\nClaim: Every SNC game on an undirected network admits a PNE.\nReason: The game is an exact potential game with potential \u03a6(x) = 1/2 \u2211_{i,j} W_{ij} x_i x_j + \u2211_i h_i x_i. Finite exact potential games admit PNE (Monderer\u2013Shapley). This is Proposition pr:pot_mixed(i,ii) in the provided paper.\n\n2) Unsigned networks (W \u2265 0)\nClaim: Every SNC game on an unsigned network admits a PNE.\nReason: The game exhibits increasing differences (supermodular). Hence PNE exist and the NE set is a nonempty lattice (Topkis). See Proposition prop:super-modular in the paper.\n\n3) Structurally balanced networks\nDefinition: V = V_1 \u2294 V_2 such that W_{ij} \u2265 0 if i,j in same part; W_{ij} \u2264 0 if i \u2208 V_q, j \u2208 V_r, q \u2260 r.\nClaim: Every SNC game on a structurally balanced network admits a PNE.\nReason: There exists a gauge transform [\u03c3] (diagonal with entries \u00b11) s.t. [\u03c3]W[\u03c3] \u2265 0 (unsigned). Apply (2) to the transformed game and map equilibria back (Lemma NashGauge). This is Proposition prop:structurally-balanced-equilibria in the paper.\n\n4) Acyclic dependency digraphs (new)\nLet G be a DAG with respect to the directed edges i\u2192j where W_{ij} \u2260 0.\nClaim: Every SNC game on a DAG admits a PNE (for any real weights and any h).\nProof (constructive): Process vertices in reverse topological order by repeatedly removing sinks. If i is a sink (no out-neighbors), set x_i \u2208 argmax_{\u00b11} h_i x_i (both if tie). Remove i and continue. When choosing x_i at some step, all j with W_{ij} \u2260 0 have already been fixed, so x_i \u2208 argmax_{\u00b11} x_i(h_i+\u2211_j W_{ij}x_j) is a best response to the current (and final) x_{-i}. Since later choices cannot change any out-neighbor of i, i remains a BR in the final profile. Thus the constructed x is a PNE.\n\n5) SCC-wise decomposition (new)\nLet the condensation of the digraph be a DAG of strongly connected components (SCCs) C_1,\u2026,C_m, ordered so that edges go from C_r to C_s only if r < s. Suppose each SCC subgraph is either undirected or structurally balanced.\nClaim: The SNC game admits a PNE.\nProof (induction over SCCs): Start from terminal SCC C_m. Since it has no outgoing edges, the game restricted to C_m has a PNE for any external field; true because: undirected \u21d2 exact potential, or structurally balanced \u21d2 gauge to unsigned \u21d2 supermodular. Fix a PNE x^{(m)} on C_m. Move to C_{m-1}: its players face an external field equal to h_i plus \u2211_{j\u2208C_s, s>m-1} W_{ij} x^{(s)}_j, a fixed vector. Again by the same reason (undirected or structurally balanced), C_{m-1} admits a PNE x^{(m-1)}. Continue backwards to C_1. The concatenation x = (x^{(1)},\u2026,x^{(m)}) is a PNE on the whole graph because each player\u2019s best-response condition depends only on out-neighbors inside its own SCC and in later SCCs, which have been fixed when choosing x^{(r)}.\n\n6) Cohesive coordinating core (paper\u2019s main existence theorem)\nLet V = R \u2294 S. Assume G_R is unsigned (or more generally structurally balanced). Define the out-degree splits w_i^R = \u2211_{j\u2208R} |W_{ij}|, w_i^S = \u2211_{j\u2208S} |W_{ij}|.\n- Unsigned core (consensus): If there exists a \u2208 {\u00b11} with w_i^R + a h_i \u2265 w_i^S for all i\u2208R, and the S-restricted game with R frozen at a\u00b71 has a PNE, then there exists a PNE with x_R = a\u00b71. Special cases ensuring the S-restricted game has a PNE: G_S undirected (potential) or G_S structurally balanced (gauge to unsigned). This is Proposition prop:mixed1 and Corollaries th:mixed_existence1\u20132.\n- Structurally balanced core (polarization): If \u03c4 \u2208 {\u00b11}^R makes G_R^{[\u03c4]} unsigned and w_i^R + \u03c4_i h_i \u2265 w_i^S for all i\u2208R, and the S-restricted game with R frozen at \u03c4 has a PNE, then there exists a PNE with x_R = \u03c4 (Theorem theo:main-existence; corollaries as above for G_S).\n\nExamples\n- No PNE: 2-node \u201cdiscoordination\u201d (W_{12}>0,W_{21}<0) and 3-cycle of negative directed edges (both violate 1\u20136).\n- DAG: a directed chain 1\u21922\u21923 with arbitrary signs/weights always has a PNE by reverse-topological construction.\n- Mixed: Figures in the paper (e.g., Fig. 1 and Fig. 5 therein) satisfy cohesive-core conditions yielding equilibria with R at consensus/polarization.\n\nObstacles/limits\n- The above are sufficient, not necessary. There are graphs outside 1\u20136 still admitting PNE for particular (W,h). Conversely, small cycles with antagonism can destroy existence.\n\nNext steps\n- Tighten the SCC criterion: identify the largest class of SCCs that admit PNE under arbitrary external fields (beyond undirected/structurally balanced), then combine through the condensation DAG.\n- Explore minimal cohesiveness thresholds ensuring existence when S is \u201cwell-behaved\u201d (potential/structurally balanced/DAG).\n- Quantify robustness: perturbations of W within classes keep PNE existence; give explicit bounds.\n\nFormal statements (for verifier)\nProposition A (DAG existence). Let G be a directed acyclic graph, W_{ij} \u2260 0 \u21d4 (i,j) \u2208 E, and h \u2208 \u211d^V arbitrary. Then the SNC game admits a pure Nash equilibrium. Proof given above.\n\nProposition B (SCC decomposition). If every strongly connected component induces a subgraph that is undirected or structurally balanced, then the SNC game admits a pure Nash equilibrium. Proof by reverse topological induction, using existence on each SCC under arbitrary external fields (Propositions 1 and 3).\n\nThese complement the paper\u2019s results (undirected, unsigned, structurally balanced; cohesive-core with undirected/structurally-balanced S)."
