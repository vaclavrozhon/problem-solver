However, they don't allow self-loops, so I'll need to consider strong conditions. For instance, if each node's bias dominates interactions, we could yield a unique pure Nash equilibrium. But wait, the task asks to identify specific graphs rather than just parameter conditions. I also want to note structural balance and possibly consider bipartite graphs. These details should guide my focus.",

This aligns with the topological ordering of directed acyclic graphs, where edges go from lower to higher indices.

Finally, we recall \u201ccohesive core\u201d conditions ensuring existence with a specific structure of the equilibrium.\\n\\nModel reminder\\n- Players i \u2208 V choose x_i \u2208 {\u00b11}. Payoffs u_i(x) = h_i x_i + x_i \u2211_j W_{ij} x_j.\\n- Directed signed graph: (i,j) \u2208 E \u21d4 W_{ij} \u2260 0. Player i\u2019s payoff depends on her out-neighbors j (the j with W_{ij} \u2260 0).\\n\\nResults (statements and succinct proofs)\\n1) Undirected networks (W = W\u2032)\\nClaim: Every SNC game on an undirected network admits a PNE.\\nReason: The game is an exact potential game with potential \u03a6(x) = 1/2 \u2211_{i,j} W_{ij} x_i x_j + \u2211_i h_i x_i. Finite exact potential games admit PNE (Monderer\u2013Shapley). This is Proposition pr:pot_mixed(i,ii) in the provided paper.\\n\\n2) Unsigned networks (W \u2265 0)\\nClaim: Every SNC game on an unsigned network admits a PNE.\\nReason: The game exhibits increasing differences (supermodular). Hence PNE exist and the NE set is a nonempty lattice (Topkis). See Proposition prop:super-modular in the paper.\\n\\n3) Structurally balanced networks\\nDefinition: V = V_1 \u2294 V_2 such that W_{ij} \u2265 0 if i,j in same part; W_{ij} \u2264 0 if i \u2208 V_q, j \u2208 V_r, q \u2260 r.\\nClaim: Every SNC game on a structurally balanced network admits a PNE.\\nReason: There exists a gauge transform [\u03c3] (diagonal with entries \u00b11) s.t. [\u03c3]W[\u03c3] \u2265 0 (unsigned). Apply (2) to the transformed game and map equilibria back (Lemma NashGauge). This is Proposition prop:structurally-balanced-equilibria in the paper.\\n\\n4) Acyclic dependency digraphs (new)\\nLet G be a DAG with respect to the directed edges i\u2192j where W_{ij} \u2260 0.\\nClaim: Every SNC game on a DAG admits a PNE (for any real weights and any h).\\nProof (constructive): Process vertices in reverse topological order by repeatedly removing sinks. If i is a sink (no out-neighbors), set x_i \u2208 argmax_{\u00b11} h_i x_i (both if tie). Remove i and continue. When choosing x_i at some step, all j with W_{ij} \u2260 0 have already been fixed, so x_i \u2208 argmax_{\u00b11} x_i(h_i+\u2211_j W_{ij}x_j) is a best response to the current (and final) x_{-i}. Since later choices cannot change any out-neighbor of i, i remains a BR in the final profile. Thus the constructed x is a PNE.\\n\\n5) SCC-wise decomposition (new)\\nLet the condensation of the digraph be a DAG of strongly connected components (SCCs) C_1,\u2026,C_m, ordered so that edges go from C_r to C_s only if r < s. Suppose each SCC subgraph is either undirected or structurally balanced.\\nClaim: The SNC game admits a PNE.\\nProof (induction over SCCs): Start from terminal SCC C_m. Since it has no outgoing edges, the game restricted to C_m has a PNE for any external field; true because: undirected \u21d2 exact potential, or structurally balanced \u21d2 gauge to unsigned \u21d2 supermodular. Fix a PNE x^{(m)} on C_m. Move to C_{m-1}: its players face an external field equal to h_i plus \u2211_{j\u2208C_s, s>m-1} W_{ij} x^{(s)}_j, a fixed vector. Again by the same reason (undirected or structurally balanced), C_{m-1} admits a PNE x^{(m-1)}. Continue backwards to C_1. The concatenation x = (x^{(1)},\u2026,x^{(m)}) is a PNE on the whole graph because each player\u2019s best-response condition depends only on out-neighbors inside its own SCC and in later SCCs, which have been fixed when choosing x^{(r)}.\\n\\n6) Cohesive coordinating core (paper\u2019s main existence theorem)\\nLet V = R \u2294 S. Assume G_R is unsigned (or more generally structurally balanced). Define the out-degree splits w_i^R = \u2211_{j\u2208R} |W_{ij}|, w_i^S = \u2211_{j\u2208S} |W_{ij}|.\\n- Unsigned core (consensus): If there exists a \u2208 {\u00b11} with w_i^R + a h_i \u2265 w_i^S for all i\u2208R, and the S-restricted game with R frozen at a\u00b71 has a PNE, then there exists a PNE with x_R = a\u00b71. Special cases ensuring the S-restricted game has a PNE: G_S undirected (potential) or G_S structurally balanced (gauge to unsigned). This is Proposition prop:mixed1 and Corollaries th:mixed_existence1\u20132.\\n- Structurally balanced core (polarization): If \u03c4 \u2208 {\u00b11}^R makes G_R^{[\u03c4]} unsigned and w_i^R + \u03c4_i h_i \u2265 w_i^S for all i\u2208R, and the S-restricted game with R frozen at \u03c4 has a PNE, then there exists a PNE with x_R = \u03c4 (Theorem theo:main-existence; corollaries as above for G_S).\\n\\nExamples\\n- No PNE: 2-node \u201cdiscoordination\u201d (W_{12}>0,W_{21}<0) and 3-cycle of negative directed edges (both violate 1\u20136).\\n- DAG: a directed chain 1\u21922\u21923 with arbitrary signs/weights always has a PNE by reverse-topological construction.\\n- Mixed: Figures in the paper (e.g., Fig. 1 and Fig. 5 therein) satisfy cohesive-core conditions yielding equilibria with R at consensus/polarization.\\n\\nObstacles/limits\\n- The above are sufficient, not necessary. There are graphs outside 1\u20136 still admitting PNE for particular (W,h). Conversely, small cycles with antagonism can destroy existence.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Tighten the SCC criterion: identify the largest class of SCCs that admit PNE under arbitrary external fields (beyond undirected/structurally balanced), then combine through the condensation DAG.\\n- Explore minimal cohesiveness thresholds ensuring existence when S is \u201cwell-behaved\u201d (potential/structurally balanced/DAG).\\n- Quantify robustness: perturbations of W within classes keep PNE existence; give explicit bounds.\\n\\nFormal statements (for verifier)\\nProposition A (DAG existence). Let G be a directed acyclic graph, W_{ij} \u2260 0 \u21d4 (i,j) \u2208 E, and h \u2208 \u211d^V arbitrary. Then the SNC game admits a pure Nash equilibrium. Proof given above.\\n\\nProposition B (SCC decomposition). If every strongly connected component induces a subgraph that is undirected or structurally balanced, then the SNC game admits a pure Nash equilibrium. Proof by reverse topological induction, using existence on each SCC under arbitrary external fields (Propositions 1 and 3).\\n\\nThese complement the paper\u2019s results (undirected, unsigned, structurally balanced; cohesive-core with undirected/structurally-balanced S).\"}",
