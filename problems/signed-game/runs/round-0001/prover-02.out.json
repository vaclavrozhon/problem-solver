  "content": "Ideas\n- We work with binary-action signed network coordination (SNC) games: u_i(x)=h_i x_i + x_i sum_j W_{ij} x_j on a directed signed graph G=(V,E,W).\n- We identify graph classes for which a pure Nash equilibrium (PNE) is guaranteed, and give short, checkable proofs + counterexamples.\n\nClass A. Undirected signed graphs (exact potential)\nClaim A1. If W is symmetric (undirected graph), the game is an exact potential game with potential \u03a6(x)=1/2 sum_{i,j} W_{ij} x_i x_j + sum_i h_i x_i. Hence, PNE exist. Moreover, a nonempty BR-stable subset of PNE exists.\nSketch. Immediate from Monderer\u2013Shapley; see Proposition in the paper.\n\nClass B. Structurally balanced graphs (gauge to unsigned)\nDefinition. G is structurally balanced if V=V_1\u222aV_2, V_1\u2229V_2=\u2205, and W_{ij}\u22650 for i,j\u2208V_q, and W_{ij}\u22640 for i\u2208V_q, j\u2208V_r, q\u2260r.\nClaim B1. G is structurally balanced iff \u2203\u03c3\u2208{\u00b11}^V such that [\u03c3]W[\u03c3]\u22650 (unsigned).\nClaim B2. On such graphs, the SNC game is supermodular (after gauge), hence PNE exist; in fact the PNE set is globally BR-reachable.\nSketch. Lemma (gauge equivalence) and standard supermodular fixed-point arguments; see Proposition in the paper.\n\nClass C. Acyclic influence graphs (DAG)\nLet the influence digraph have an edge (i,j) iff W_{ij}\u22600 (so i\u2019s payoff depends on j). Suppose this digraph is acyclic.\nTheorem C1 (Backward induction on DAG). If the influence digraph is acyclic, a PNE exists for every W,h (arbitrary signs), and is BR-reachable.\nProof. Order vertices topologically so W_{ij}=0 for j\u2264i. Pick x_n\u2208argmax_{\u00b11} h_n x_n, then x_{n-1}\u2208argmax h_{n-1}x_{n-1}+x_{n-1}\u2211_{j>n-1}W_{n-1,j}x_j, and so on down to 1. Because u_i depends only on j>i, each choice is a best response to the final profile; no later updates affect u_i. This constructs a PNE. A BR-path exists by mimicking this construction.\n\nClass D. SCC-by-SCC composition\nLet C_1,\u2026,C_m be the strongly connected components (SCCs) of the influence digraph, ordered so that if \u2203i\u2208C_k,j\u2208C_\u2113 with W_{ij}\u22600 then k<\u2113 (edges go from earlier to later).\nTheorem D1 (Existence via SCCs). Suppose that for each SCC C_k, the restricted SNC game on C_k admits a PNE for every external field (equivalently: G_{C_k} is undirected or structurally balanced). Then the whole game has a PNE; one is BR-reachable.\nProof. Induct on k from m down to 1. For C_m, there are no outgoing edges, so utilities do not depend on outside; by assumption there is a PNE x^*_C_m. Freeze it. For C_{m-1}, the outside actions only enter as an external field h^{(x^*_{>m-1})}; by assumption, the subgame on C_{m-1} has a PNE. Continue. Concatenate BR-paths within each SCC to obtain a global BR-path. The terminal profile is a PNE of the full game.\nRemarks.\n- This strictly generalizes Class A (every SCC undirected) and Class B (every SCC structurally balanced) and includes Class C (all SCCs are singletons).\n\nClass E. Cohesive coordinating blocks\nLet V=R\u222aS with R\u2229S=\u2205. Write w_i^B=\u2211_{j\u2208B}|W_{ij}|.\nUnsigned R (coordination in R). If G_R is unsigned and there exists a\u2208{\u00b11} such that for all i\u2208R: w_i^R + a h_i \u2265 w_i^S, and the S-subgame with R frozen to a1 has a PNE, then the full game has a PNE with x_R=a1. This holds in particular if G_S is undirected or structurally balanced (their subgames admit PNE for every external field). See Proposition/Theorem in the paper.\nStructurally balanced R (polarization). If G_R is structurally balanced, pick \u03c4\u2208{\u00b11}^R with \u03c4_i W_{ij} \u03c4_j \u22650 on R\u00d7R; if w_i^R + \u03c4_i h_i \u2265 w_i^S \u2200i\u2208R and the S-subgame with R frozen to \u03c4 has a PNE (e.g., G_S undirected or structurally balanced), then the full game has a PNE with x_R=\u03c4 (polarized on R).\n\nExamples\n1) DAG with mixed signs. 1\u21922\u21923, weights W_{12}=-3,W_{23}=2, others 0, h=(0,1,-2). By Theorem C1, choose x_3=sgn(h_3)=-1, x_2=sgn(h_2+W_{23}x_3)=sgn(1-2)=-1, x_1=sgn(h_1+W_{12}x_2)=sgn(3)=+1. This is a PNE; a BR-path follows the same order.\n2) Two SCCs. C_1={1,2} with mutual negative links (structurally balanced), C_2={3} (singleton). Edges only from 1,2 to 3. Solve C_2 first (trivial), then C_1 (structurally balanced \u21d2 PNE exists for any field). Global PNE exists and is BR-reachable (Theorem D1).\n3) Counterexamples. (i) 2-node \u201cdiscoordination\u201d with one positive and one negative arc has no PNE; it fails Class A/B and contains a 2-cycle (so not Class C). (ii) 3-cycle with all negative arcs has no PNE; not structurally balanced, not a DAG.\n\nObstacles/limits\n- Classes A\u2013E are sufficient, not necessary. There exist graphs outside these classes that admit PNE for specific h,W.\n- Global BR-reachability or BR-stability may fail even when PNE exist (cf. examples in the paper).\n\nNext steps\n- Tighten Class D: characterize SCCs that are \u201cuniversally PNE-admitting\u201d (for all external fields) beyond undirected/structurally balanced; e.g., other exact-potential polymatrix structures.\n- Explore minimal cut/cohesion relaxations in Class E (only boundary nodes of R may need w_i^R + \u03c4_i h_i \u2265 w_i^S).\n- Algorithmic pipeline: (i) check DAG \u21d2 PNE; else (ii) decompose into SCCs, test each for undirected/struct. balanced; if yes \u21d2 PNE by D1; else (iii) try to find cohesive R and apply E.\n\nProofs (details suitable for proofs.md)\nProof of Theorem C1. Let \u03c0 be a topological order with W_{ij}=0 for j\u2264i. Define x_n\u2208argmax_{\u00b11} u_n(x) since u_n=h_n x_n. Having fixed x_{n},\u2026,x_{i+1}, define x_i\u2208argmax_{\u00b11} h_i x_i + x_i\u2211_{j>i}W_{ij}x_j. Then u_i depends only on x_{>i}, so x_i is a best response in the final profile. Hence the constructed x is a PNE. A BR-path is obtained by letting players update in the order n,n\u22121,\u2026,1.\n\nProof of Theorem D1. Let the SCC condensation be C_1,\u2026,C_m with edges from k to \u2113 only if k<\u2113. For k=m, the restricted game on C_m is independent of outside actions (rows to outside are zero), and, by hypothesis, admits a PNE x^*_{C_m}. Inductively, suppose x^*_{C_{k+1}},\u2026,x^*_{C_m} are fixed. Then for i\u2208C_k, the utility is u_i(x)=x_i\u2211_{j\u2208C_k}W_{ij}x_j + x_i( h_i + \u2211_{j>k}W_{ij}x^*_j ). Thus the C_k-subgame is an SNC game on G_{C_k} with external field h^{(k)}=h_{C_k}+W_{C_k,>k}x^*_{>k}. By hypothesis it has a PNE x^*_{C_k}. Concatenating yields a PNE x^*. A BR-path is constructed by running BR paths within C_m,C_{m-1},\u2026,C_1 in this order; C_m\u2019s utilities do not depend on outside, so updates elsewhere do not invalidate previous best responses.\n\nProofs for Classes A,B,E follow the propositions/theorems already in the paper; in E the inequalities w_i^R + a h_i \u2265 w_i^S or w_i^R + \u03c4_i h_i \u2265 w_i^S ensure R\u2019s consensus/polarization is a best response for all i\u2208R; existence in S is guaranteed if G_S is undirected or structurally balanced.\n\nSummary (for output.md)\n- PNE exist on: (i) undirected signed graphs; (ii) structurally balanced graphs (after gauge); (iii) acyclic influence graphs (DAGs); (iv) graphs whose SCCs are each undirected or structurally balanced (compose by reverse topological order); (v) graphs containing a cohesive coordinating block R satisfying w_i^R + a h_i \u2265 w_i^S (or polarized \u03c4) and with S-subgame admitting PNE (e.g., S undirected or structurally balanced).\n- Classes (iii)\u2013(v) are constructive and yield BR-paths to a PNE."
