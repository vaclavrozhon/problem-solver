The paper suggests that this is equivalent to a gauge transform. I\u2019m thinking of how to build a graph with sign-labeled edges and check if it meets bipartition constraints, which relates to 2-SAT. Each edge gives a constraint, and direction doesn\u2019t change the conditions. I need to ensure the underlying undirected graph aligns with these constraints, checking for consistency. I wonder about identifying families of graphs with specific properties, especially concerning mixed networks and pure Nash equilibria.",

In undirected cases, exact potential correlates with symmetry, yet sign-symmetry allows for directed weights that can vary in magnitude. It raises the question: must exact potential require symmetry in W rather than just sign symmetry? \n\nI wonder if we can define an \"ordinal potential.\" For symmetric, sign-symmetric two-player games, I think potential can exist if both edges are positive. Analyzing the utilities for both players shows that there may indeed be pure strategy equilibria.

This is significant because it identifies class of graphs that guarantee PNE regardless of the signs on edges.\n\nI should address potential issues, like cycles, but since I\u2019m dealing with a DAG, that\u2019s not a concern.

Undirected signed graphs (exact potential)\\nClaim A1. If W is symmetric (undirected graph), the game is an exact potential game with potential \u03a6(x)=1/2 sum_{i,j} W_{ij} x_i x_j + sum_i h_i x_i. Hence, PNE exist. Moreover, a nonempty BR-stable subset of PNE exists.\\nSketch. Immediate from Monderer\u2013Shapley; see Proposition in the paper.\\n\\nClass B. Structurally balanced graphs (gauge to unsigned)\\nDefinition. G is structurally balanced if V=V_1\u222aV_2, V_1\u2229V_2=\u2205, and W_{ij}\u22650 for i,j\u2208V_q, and W_{ij}\u22640 for i\u2208V_q, j\u2208V_r, q\u2260r.\\nClaim B1. G is structurally balanced iff \u2203\u03c3\u2208{\u00b11}^V such that [\u03c3]W[\u03c3]\u22650 (unsigned).\\nClaim B2. On such graphs, the SNC game is supermodular (after gauge), hence PNE exist; in fact the PNE set is globally BR-reachable.\\nSketch. Lemma (gauge equivalence) and standard supermodular fixed-point arguments; see Proposition in the paper.\\n\\nClass C. Acyclic influence graphs (DAG)\\nLet the influence digraph have an edge (i,j) iff W_{ij}\u22600 (so i\u2019s payoff depends on j). Suppose this digraph is acyclic.\\nTheorem C1 (Backward induction on DAG). If the influence digraph is acyclic, a PNE exists for every W,h (arbitrary signs), and is BR-reachable.\\nProof. Order vertices topologically so W_{ij}=0 for j\u2264i. Pick x_n\u2208argmax_{\u00b11} h_n x_n, then x_{n-1}\u2208argmax h_{n-1}x_{n-1}+x_{n-1}\u2211_{j>n-1}W_{n-1,j}x_j, and so on down to 1. Because u_i depends only on j>i, each choice is a best response to the final profile; no later updates affect u_i. This constructs a PNE. A BR-path exists by mimicking this construction.\\n\\nClass D. SCC-by-SCC composition\\nLet C_1,\u2026,C_m be the strongly connected components (SCCs) of the influence digraph, ordered so that if \u2203i\u2208C_k,j\u2208C_\u2113 with W_{ij}\u22600 then k<\u2113 (edges go from earlier to later).\\nTheorem D1 (Existence via SCCs). Suppose that for each SCC C_k, the restricted SNC game on C_k admits a PNE for every external field (equivalently: G_{C_k} is undirected or structurally balanced). Then the whole game has a PNE; one is BR-reachable.\\nProof. Induct on k from m down to 1. For C_m, there are no outgoing edges, so utilities do not depend on outside; by assumption there is a PNE x^*_C_m. Freeze it. For C_{m-1}, the outside actions only enter as an external field h^{(x^*_{>m-1})}; by assumption, the subgame on C_{m-1} has a PNE. Continue. Concatenate BR-paths within each SCC to obtain a global BR-path. The terminal profile is a PNE of the full game.\\nRemarks.\\n- This strictly generalizes Class A (every SCC undirected) and Class B (every SCC structurally balanced) and includes Class C (all SCCs are singletons).\\n\\nClass E. Cohesive coordinating blocks\\nLet V=R\u222aS with R\u2229S=\u2205. Write w_i^B=\u2211_{j\u2208B}|W_{ij}|.\\nUnsigned R (coordination in R). If G_R is unsigned and there exists a\u2208{\u00b11} such that for all i\u2208R: w_i^R + a h_i \u2265 w_i^S, and the S-subgame with R frozen to a1 has a PNE, then the full game has a PNE with x_R=a1. This holds in particular if G_S is undirected or structurally balanced (their subgames admit PNE for every external field). See Proposition/Theorem in the paper.\\nStructurally balanced R (polarization). If G_R is structurally balanced, pick \u03c4\u2208{\u00b11}^R with \u03c4_i W_{ij} \u03c4_j \u22650 on R\u00d7R; if w_i^R + \u03c4_i h_i \u2265 w_i^S \u2200i\u2208R and the S-subgame with R frozen to \u03c4 has a PNE (e.g., G_S undirected or structurally balanced), then the full game has a PNE with x_R=\u03c4 (polarized on R).\\n\\nExamples\\n1) DAG with mixed signs. 1\u21922\u21923, weights W_{12}=-3,W_{23}=2, others 0, h=(0,1,-2). By Theorem C1, choose x_3=sgn(h_3)=-1, x_2=sgn(h_2+W_{23}x_3)=sgn(1-2)=-1, x_1=sgn(h_1+W_{12}x_2)=sgn(3)=+1. This is a PNE; a BR-path follows the same order.\\n2) Two SCCs. C_1={1,2} with mutual negative links (structurally balanced), C_2={3} (singleton). Edges only from 1,2 to 3. Solve C_2 first (trivial), then C_1 (structurally balanced \u21d2 PNE exists for any field). Global PNE exists and is BR-reachable (Theorem D1).\\n3) Counterexamples. (i) 2-node \u201cdiscoordination\u201d with one positive and one negative arc has no PNE; it fails Class A/B and contains a 2-cycle (so not Class C). (ii) 3-cycle with all negative arcs has no PNE; not structurally balanced, not a DAG.\\n\\nObstacles/limits\\n- Classes A\u2013E are sufficient, not necessary. There exist graphs outside these classes that admit PNE for specific h,W.\\n- Global BR-reachability or BR-stability may fail even when PNE exist (cf. examples in the paper).\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Tighten Class D: characterize SCCs that are \u201cuniversally PNE-admitting\u201d (for all external fields) beyond undirected/structurally balanced; e.g., other exact-potential polymatrix structures.\\n- Explore minimal cut/cohesion relaxations in Class E (only boundary nodes of R may need w_i^R + \u03c4_i h_i \u2265 w_i^S).\\n- Algorithmic pipeline: (i) check DAG \u21d2 PNE; else (ii) decompose into SCCs, test each for undirected/struct. balanced; if yes \u21d2 PNE by D1; else (iii) try to find cohesive R and apply E.\\n\\nProofs (details suitable for proofs.md)\\nProof of Theorem C1. Let \u03c0 be a topological order with W_{ij}=0 for j\u2264i. Define x_n\u2208argmax_{\u00b11} u_n(x) since u_n=h_n x_n. Having fixed x_{n},\u2026,x_{i+1}, define x_i\u2208argmax_{\u00b11} h_i x_i + x_i\u2211_{j>i}W_{ij}x_j. Then u_i depends only on x_{>i}, so x_i is a best response in the final profile. Hence the constructed x is a PNE. A BR-path is obtained by letting players update in the order n,n\u22121,\u2026,1.\\n\\nProof of Theorem D1. Let the SCC condensation be C_1,\u2026,C_m with edges from k to \u2113 only if k<\u2113. For k=m, the restricted game on C_m is independent of outside actions (rows to outside are zero), and, by hypothesis, admits a PNE x^*_{C_m}. Inductively, suppose x^*_{C_{k+1}},\u2026,x^*_{C_m} are fixed. Then for i\u2208C_k, the utility is u_i(x)=x_i\u2211_{j\u2208C_k}W_{ij}x_j + x_i( h_i + \u2211_{j>k}W_{ij}x^*_j ). Thus the C_k-subgame is an SNC game on G_{C_k} with external field h^{(k)}=h_{C_k}+W_{C_k,>k}x^*_{>k}. By hypothesis it has a PNE x^*_{C_k}. Concatenating yields a PNE x^*. A BR-path is constructed by running BR paths within C_m,C_{m-1},\u2026,C_1 in this order; C_m\u2019s utilities do not depend on outside, so updates elsewhere do not invalidate previous best responses.\\n\\nProofs for Classes A,B,E follow the propositions/theorems already in the paper; in E the inequalities w_i^R + a h_i \u2265 w_i^S or w_i^R + \u03c4_i h_i \u2265 w_i^S ensure R\u2019s consensus/polarization is a best response for all i\u2208R; existence in S is guaranteed if G_S is undirected or structurally balanced.\\n\\nSummary (for output.md)\\n- PNE exist on: (i) undirected signed graphs; (ii) structurally balanced graphs (after gauge); (iii) acyclic influence graphs (DAGs); (iv) graphs whose SCCs are each undirected or structurally balanced (compose by reverse topological order); (v) graphs containing a cohesive coordinating block R satisfying w_i^R + a h_i \u2265 w_i^S (or polarized \u03c4) and with S-subgame admitting PNE (e.g., S undirected or structurally balanced).\\n- Classes (iii)\u2013(v) are constructive and yield BR-paths to a PNE.\"}",
