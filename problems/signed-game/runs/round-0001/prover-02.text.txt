Ideas
- We work with binary-action signed network coordination (SNC) games: u_i(x)=h_i x_i + x_i sum_j W_{ij} x_j on a directed signed graph G=(V,E,W).
- We identify graph classes for which a pure Nash equilibrium (PNE) is guaranteed, and give short, checkable proofs + counterexamples.

Class A. Undirected signed graphs (exact potential)
Claim A1. If W is symmetric (undirected graph), the game is an exact potential game with potential Φ(x)=1/2 sum_{i,j} W_{ij} x_i x_j + sum_i h_i x_i. Hence, PNE exist. Moreover, a nonempty BR-stable subset of PNE exists.
Sketch. Immediate from Monderer–Shapley; see Proposition in the paper.

Class B. Structurally balanced graphs (gauge to unsigned)
Definition. G is structurally balanced if V=V_1∪V_2, V_1∩V_2=∅, and W_{ij}≥0 for i,j∈V_q, and W_{ij}≤0 for i∈V_q, j∈V_r, q≠r.
Claim B1. G is structurally balanced iff ∃σ∈{±1}^V such that [σ]W[σ]≥0 (unsigned).
Claim B2. On such graphs, the SNC game is supermodular (after gauge), hence PNE exist; in fact the PNE set is globally BR-reachable.
Sketch. Lemma (gauge equivalence) and standard supermodular fixed-point arguments; see Proposition in the paper.

Class C. Acyclic influence graphs (DAG)
Let the influence digraph have an edge (i,j) iff W_{ij}≠0 (so i’s payoff depends on j). Suppose this digraph is acyclic.
Theorem C1 (Backward induction on DAG). If the influence digraph is acyclic, a PNE exists for every W,h (arbitrary signs), and is BR-reachable.
Proof. Order vertices topologically so W_{ij}=0 for j≤i. Pick x_n∈argmax_{±1} h_n x_n, then x_{n-1}∈argmax h_{n-1}x_{n-1}+x_{n-1}∑_{j>n-1}W_{n-1,j}x_j, and so on down to 1. Because u_i depends only on j>i, each choice is a best response to the final profile; no later updates affect u_i. This constructs a PNE. A BR-path exists by mimicking this construction.

Class D. SCC-by-SCC composition
Let C_1,…,C_m be the strongly connected components (SCCs) of the influence digraph, ordered so that if ∃i∈C_k,j∈C_ℓ with W_{ij}≠0 then k<ℓ (edges go from earlier to later).
Theorem D1 (Existence via SCCs). Suppose that for each SCC C_k, the restricted SNC game on C_k admits a PNE for every external field (equivalently: G_{C_k} is undirected or structurally balanced). Then the whole game has a PNE; one is BR-reachable.
Proof. Induct on k from m down to 1. For C_m, there are no outgoing edges, so utilities do not depend on outside; by assumption there is a PNE x^*_C_m. Freeze it. For C_{m-1}, the outside actions only enter as an external field h^{(x^*_{>m-1})}; by assumption, the subgame on C_{m-1} has a PNE. Continue. Concatenate BR-paths within each SCC to obtain a global BR-path. The terminal profile is a PNE of the full game.
Remarks.
- This strictly generalizes Class A (every SCC undirected) and Class B (every SCC structurally balanced) and includes Class C (all SCCs are singletons).

Class E. Cohesive coordinating blocks
Let V=R∪S with R∩S=∅. Write w_i^B=∑_{j∈B}|W_{ij}|.
Unsigned R (coordination in R). If G_R is unsigned and there exists a∈{±1} such that for all i∈R: w_i^R + a h_i ≥ w_i^S, and the S-subgame with R frozen to a1 has a PNE, then the full game has a PNE with x_R=a1. This holds in particular if G_S is undirected or structurally balanced (their subgames admit PNE for every external field). See Proposition/Theorem in the paper.
Structurally balanced R (polarization). If G_R is structurally balanced, pick τ∈{±1}^R with τ_i W_{ij} τ_j ≥0 on R×R; if w_i^R + τ_i h_i ≥ w_i^S ∀i∈R and the S-subgame with R frozen to τ has a PNE (e.g., G_S undirected or structurally balanced), then the full game has a PNE with x_R=τ (polarized on R).

Examples
1) DAG with mixed signs. 1→2→3, weights W_{12}=-3,W_{23}=2, others 0, h=(0,1,-2). By Theorem C1, choose x_3=sgn(h_3)=-1, x_2=sgn(h_2+W_{23}x_3)=sgn(1-2)=-1, x_1=sgn(h_1+W_{12}x_2)=sgn(3)=+1. This is a PNE; a BR-path follows the same order.
2) Two SCCs. C_1={1,2} with mutual negative links (structurally balanced), C_2={3} (singleton). Edges only from 1,2 to 3. Solve C_2 first (trivial), then C_1 (structurally balanced ⇒ PNE exists for any field). Global PNE exists and is BR-reachable (Theorem D1).
3) Counterexamples. (i) 2-node “discoordination” with one positive and one negative arc has no PNE; it fails Class A/B and contains a 2-cycle (so not Class C). (ii) 3-cycle with all negative arcs has no PNE; not structurally balanced, not a DAG.

Obstacles/limits
- Classes A–E are sufficient, not necessary. There exist graphs outside these classes that admit PNE for specific h,W.
- Global BR-reachability or BR-stability may fail even when PNE exist (cf. examples in the paper).

Next steps
- Tighten Class D: characterize SCCs that are “universally PNE-admitting” (for all external fields) beyond undirected/structurally balanced; e.g., other exact-potential polymatrix structures.
- Explore minimal cut/cohesion relaxations in Class E (only boundary nodes of R may need w_i^R + τ_i h_i ≥ w_i^S).
- Algorithmic pipeline: (i) check DAG ⇒ PNE; else (ii) decompose into SCCs, test each for undirected/struct. balanced; if yes ⇒ PNE by D1; else (iii) try to find cohesive R and apply E.

Proofs (details suitable for proofs.md)
Proof of Theorem C1. Let π be a topological order with W_{ij}=0 for j≤i. Define x_n∈argmax_{±1} u_n(x) since u_n=h_n x_n. Having fixed x_{n},…,x_{i+1}, define x_i∈argmax_{±1} h_i x_i + x_i∑_{j>i}W_{ij}x_j. Then u_i depends only on x_{>i}, so x_i is a best response in the final profile. Hence the constructed x is a PNE. A BR-path is obtained by letting players update in the order n,n−1,…,1.

Proof of Theorem D1. Let the SCC condensation be C_1,…,C_m with edges from k to ℓ only if k<ℓ. For k=m, the restricted game on C_m is independent of outside actions (rows to outside are zero), and, by hypothesis, admits a PNE x^*_{C_m}. Inductively, suppose x^*_{C_{k+1}},…,x^*_{C_m} are fixed. Then for i∈C_k, the utility is u_i(x)=x_i∑_{j∈C_k}W_{ij}x_j + x_i( h_i + ∑_{j>k}W_{ij}x^*_j ). Thus the C_k-subgame is an SNC game on G_{C_k} with external field h^{(k)}=h_{C_k}+W_{C_k,>k}x^*_{>k}. By hypothesis it has a PNE x^*_{C_k}. Concatenating yields a PNE x^*. A BR-path is constructed by running BR paths within C_m,C_{m-1},…,C_1 in this order; C_m’s utilities do not depend on outside, so updates elsewhere do not invalidate previous best responses.

Proofs for Classes A,B,E follow the propositions/theorems already in the paper; in E the inequalities w_i^R + a h_i ≥ w_i^S or w_i^R + τ_i h_i ≥ w_i^S ensure R’s consensus/polarization is a best response for all i∈R; existence in S is guaranteed if G_S is undirected or structurally balanced.

Summary (for output.md)
- PNE exist on: (i) undirected signed graphs; (ii) structurally balanced graphs (after gauge); (iii) acyclic influence graphs (DAGs); (iv) graphs whose SCCs are each undirected or structurally balanced (compose by reverse topological order); (v) graphs containing a cohesive coordinating block R satisfying w_i^R + a h_i ≥ w_i^S (or polarized τ) and with S-subgame admitting PNE (e.g., S undirected or structurally balanced).
- Classes (iii)–(v) are constructive and yield BR-paths to a PNE.
