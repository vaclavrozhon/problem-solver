  "content": "Ideas\n\nWe collect graph-theoretic conditions under which a signed network coordination (SNC) game with binary actions admits at least one pure Nash equilibrium (PNE). We also add two new, simple-to-check sufficient classes (acyclic dependency graphs; block-triangular assembly via strongly connected components) with short proofs.\n\nModel reminder. Players i\u2208V choose xi\u2208{\u00b11}. Utilities: ui(x)=hixi+\u2211j Wij xixj. Edge (i,j) is present iff Wij\u22600 and indicates that i\u2019s utility depends on j\u2019s action.\n\nA. Known sufficient graph classes (with short proofs or references)\n\nA1) Undirected signed graphs (W=W\u2032) \u21d2 exact potential game \u21d2 PNE exists.\nClaim. If W=W\u2032 then the game is an exact potential game with potential \u03a6(x)=1/2 \u2211i,j Wij xixj + \u2211i hi xi. Hence a PNE exists (finite potential games). Proof: For any i and fixed x\u2212i, ui(\u00b7,x\u2212i) increments match \u03a6\u2019s increments by symmetry (standard; see Monderer\u2013Shapley 1996). Thus at least one global maximizer of \u03a6 is a PNE.\n\nA2) Unsigned graphs (Wij\u22650) \u21d2 supermodular \u21d2 PNE exists.\nClaim. If Wij\u22650 for all i,j then the game is supermodular (increasing differences). Hence a PNE exists (Tarski). Proof sketch: \u03b4i(x)=ui(+1,x\u2212i)\u2212ui(\u22121,x\u2212i)=2hi+2\u2211j Wij xj; if Wij\u22650 and x\u2264y then \u03b4i(y)\u2212\u03b4i(x)=2\u2211j Wij (yj\u2212xj)\u22650, giving increasing differences; existence follows.\n\nA3) Structurally balanced signed graphs \u21d2 gauge-transform to unsigned \u21d2 PNE exists.\nClaim. If there exists a partition V=V1\u2294V2 such that weights are nonnegative within parts and nonpositive across, then there is a diagonal signature [\u03c3] with entries \u03c3i\u2208{\u00b11} for which W[\u03c3]=[\u03c3]W[\u03c3]\u22650. The transformed game is unsigned, so it has a PNE; mapping back by xi\u2190\u03c3i yi gives a PNE for the original game. (Altafini 2013.)\n\nB. Cohesive-subgraph guarantees (robust consensus/polarization inside a subgraph)\nLet V=R\u2294S. Assume GR is unsigned (coordination) or structurally balanced (after some \u03c4\u2208{\u00b11}R, GR becomes unsigned). Define weighted out-degrees w_i^B=\u2211j\u2208B |Wij|.\n\nB1) Existence with R at consensus (unsigned GR).\nAssume for some a\u2208{\u00b11}:\n(1) w_i^R + a h_i \u2265 w_i^S for all i\u2208R, and\n(2) the S-restricted game with y=a1R has a PNE (e.g., GS undirected or structurally balanced).\nThen the full game has a PNE x* with x*R=a 1R. Proof idea: (1) makes a a best response for every i\u2208R regardless of z\u2208{\u00b11}S, while (2) supplies z*\u2208NES^(a1). Then (a1,z*) is a PNE.\n\nB2) Existence with R polarized (structurally balanced GR).\nAssume there is \u03c4\u2208{\u00b11}R such that \u03c4i Wij \u03c4j\u22650 for i,j\u2208R (so GR becomes unsigned under [\u03c4]). If\n(1\u2032) w_i^R + \u03c4i h_i \u2265 w_i^S for all i\u2208R, and\n(2\u2032) the S-restricted game with y=\u03c4 has a PNE (again true if GS undirected or structurally balanced),\nthen the game has a PNE x* with x*R=\u03c4.\n\nThese are precisely the existence theorems in the provided paper (Proposition 1 and Theorem 1 there, plus corollaries), specialized to binary actions.\n\nC. New sufficient graph classes (simple, checkable)\n\nC1) Acyclic dependency graphs (DAGs) \u21d2 PNE exists (for any signs/weights).\nDefine the dependency digraph with arcs i\u2192j iff Wij\u22600 (i\u2019s utility depends on j). If this digraph is acyclic, a topological ordering v1,\u2026,vn exists with edges only from lower to higher indices. Then W is strictly upper-triangular in that order: ui depends only on xj for j>i. Construct x by backward induction:\n\u2022 Choose xn\u2208argmax ui(xn) (depends only on hn). For k=n\u22121,\u2026,1, choose xk\u2208argmax uk(xk,xk+1,\u2026,xn).\nBecause ui does not depend on x1,\u2026,xi\u22121, each chosen xk remains a best response in the final profile. Hence the constructed x is a PNE. This covers all DAGs irrespective of signs.\n\nC2) Block-triangular assembly via SCCs (componentwise existence \u21d2 global existence).\nLet C1,\u2026,CK be the strongly connected components (SCCs) in a topological order of the condensation DAG (edges only from Ca to Cb with a<b). Suppose each induced subgame on Ck is from a family that admits a PNE for every external field (e.g., undirected, unsigned, or structurally balanced). Then the full game has a PNE.\nProof. Start from sink CK: its players\u2019 utilities depend only on xCK and biases; pick any PNE xCK. Move to CK\u22121: its utilities depend on xCK only through affine shifts in hk; by hypothesis the restricted game on CK\u22121 has a PNE; pick xCK\u22121; iterate upward. The concatenated profile x is a PNE globally. Note this strictly generalizes C1) (DAG = each SCC is a singleton), and also composes the known classes A1\u2013A3 under forward-only inter-component influence.\n\nExamples\n\n1) DAG example. Chain 1\u21922\u21923 with arbitrary signed weights. Order (1,2,3). Choose x3 to maximize u3 (depends only on h3). Then choose x2 best responding to x3, then x1 to (x2,x3). The resulting x is a PNE.\n\n2) SCC assembly example. Two components C1 and C2 with edges only C1\u2192C2. Suppose G[C1] is undirected (any signs), G[C2] is structurally balanced. Pick a PNE on C2; treat its effect as an external field on C1 and pick a PNE on C1. Their product is a PNE.\n\nObstacles and limits\n\n\u2022 Cycles of pure anti-coordination can destroy existence (3-cycle all \u22121 weights has no PNE). This violates A3, C1, C2 (since its SCC is not from a guaranteed family).\n\u2022 The cohesive-subgraph conditions (B1\u2013B2) require an equilibrium in the complement S when R is frozen. This holds if GS is undirected or structurally balanced; otherwise, it may fail.\n\nNext steps (auditable targets)\n\n\u2022 Tighten C2: characterize largest per-SCC families closed under external-field perturbations that guarantee PNE.\n\u2022 Develop efficient checks: (i) test structural balance on SCCs via a signed 2-coloring; (ii) find maximal cohesive R satisfying w_i^R + \u03c4i h_i \u2265 w_i^S.\n\u2022 Empirical stress tests: generate random signed DAGs and SCC-assemblies; verify backward-induction PNE construction and the B1\u2013B2 inequalities algorithmically.\n\nFormal statements (for proofs.md)\n\nLemma (Undirected \u21d2 potential). If W=W\u2032, \u03a6(x)=1/2 \u2211i,j Wij xixj + \u2211i hi xi is an exact potential; hence a PNE exists.\n\nLemma (Unsigned \u21d2 supermodular). If Wij\u22650, the game has increasing differences and thus a PNE.\n\nLemma (Structural balance \u21d2 gauge to unsigned). If \u2203\u03c3\u2208{\u00b11}V with [\u03c3]W[\u03c3]\u22650, then a PNE exists and pulls back to a PNE of the original game via x\u2190[\u03c3]y.\n\nTheorem (Cohesive R, unsigned). If V=R\u2294S, GR unsigned, \u2203a\u2208{\u00b11} with w_i^R + a h_i \u2265 w_i^S \u2200i\u2208R, and the S-restricted game with y=a1R has a PNE, then the full game has a PNE with xR=a1R.\n\nTheorem (Cohesive R, structurally balanced). If V=R\u2294S, \u2203\u03c4\u2208{\u00b11}R with \u03c4i Wij \u03c4j\u22650 on R, w_i^R + \u03c4i h_i \u2265 w_i^S \u2200i\u2208R, and the S-restricted game with y=\u03c4 has a PNE, then the full game has a PNE with xR=\u03c4.\n\nLemma (DAG \u21d2 PNE). If the dependency digraph is acyclic, a PNE exists by backward induction along a topological order.\n\nTheorem (SCC assembly). If the condensation DAG is ordered C1,\u2026,CK and each subgame on Ck (with arbitrary external field) admits a PNE (e.g., undirected, unsigned, or structurally balanced), then the full game admits a PNE, constructible by solving components from sinks upward.\n"
