Counterexamples show why negative directed cycles fall outside these classes.\\n\\nResults and proofs\\n1) Undirected signed graphs (exact potential)\\nClaim. If W is symmetric (undirected network), then a PNE exists for all h.\\nProof. Define \u03a6(x)= 1/2\u2211_{i,j}W_{ij}x_i x_j + \u2211_i h_i x_i. If x,y differ only at i with y_i=\u2212x_i, then \u03a6(y)\u2212\u03a6(x)=2(h_i+\u2211_jW_{ij}x_j)x_i= u_i(y)\u2212u_i(x). Hence \u03a6 is an exact potential. A finite exact potential game admits a maximizer x*, which is a PNE. \u220e\\n\\n2) Structurally balanced signed digraphs (gauge to supermodular)\\nDefinition. G is structurally balanced if V can be bipartitioned V=V_1\u2294V_2 with W_{ij}\u22650 on edges inside V_q and W_{ij}\u22640 on edges between V_1 and V_2.\\nEquivalent formulation. There exists \u03c3\u2208{\u00b11}^V such that W'=[\u03c3]W[\u03c3] is entrywise nonnegative on edges.\\nTheorem. If G is structurally balanced, then a PNE exists for all h.\\nProof. Consider the change of variables y=[\u03c3]x. Then u_i(x)=u_i^{[\u03c3]}(y)=h_i^{[\u03c3]}y_i + y_i\u2211_j W'_{ij}y_j with W'\u22650. This is a (possibly directed) coordination game, hence supermodular: for x\u2264y, the discrete slope \u03b4_i(y)\u2212\u03b4_i(x)=2\u2211_j W'_{ij}(y_j\u2212x_j)\u22650. Finite supermodular games have a PNE by Tarski\u2019s fixed-point theorem. Mapping back gives a PNE of the original game. \u220e\\n\\n3) Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)\\nTheorem. If the directed graph (i\u2192j whenever W_{ij}\u22600) is acyclic, then a PNE exists for all h and W.\\nProof. Take a topological ordering v_1,\u2026,v_n with edges i\u2192j implying i<j. Assign actions in reverse order t=n,\u2026,1. When choosing x_{v_t} set it to a best reply to already assigned out-neighbors {j: v_t\u2192j}. Since u_{v_t} depends only on those out-neighbors and h_{v_t}, later choices x_{v_s} with s<t do not affect u_{v_t}. By induction, the final profile is a best reply for every player. \u220e\\n\\n4) SCC-wise composition\\nLet C_1,\u2026,C_m be the SCCs and let \ud835\udca2\u0302 be the condensation DAG. For S\u2286V define the restricted game on S with external field h^S = h_S + W_{S, V\\\\S} x_{V\\\\S} (constants once x_{V\\\\S} is fixed).\\nTheorem (SCC existence). Suppose for every SCC C, the induced subgraph G[C] is either (a) undirected (W_{ij}=W_{ji} on C) or (b) structurally balanced. Then a PNE exists for all h.\\nProof. Process SCCs in reverse topological order on \ud835\udca2\u0302. If C is a sink, nodes in C have no out-edges leaving C, so their utilities depend only on x_C and h_C; by (a) or (b) the restricted game on C admits a PNE x_C. Inductively, assume x is fixed on all SCCs that C points to; this turns those out-edges into a fixed h^C. By (a) or (b), the restricted game on C with field h^C has a PNE; fix it. Utilities of already processed SCCs depend only on their out-neighbors (already fixed), so they remain best replies. At termination, all players are best replying. \u220e\\n\\n5) Cohesive balanced cores (mixed graphs)\\nLet V=R\u2294S. Suppose G[R] is structurally balanced and choose \u03c4\u2208{\u00b11}^R with \u03c4_i W_{ij} \u03c4_j \u2265 0 for i,j\u2208R (i.e., [\u03c4]-transform makes R unsigned). If for all i\u2208R\\nw_i^{R} + \u03c4_i h_i \u2265 w_i^{S}  (cohesiveness),\\nthen fixing x_R=\u03c4 is a best reply for every i\u2208R against any x_S. If, in addition, the subgame on S with field h^S=h_S+W_{S,R}\u03c4 admits a PNE (e.g., because G[S] is undirected or structurally balanced), the whole game admits a PNE with x_R=\u03c4. This recovers and generalizes known \u201crobust consensus/polarization\u201d existence results.\\n\\nExamples\\n- Failure (no PNE): the directed 3-cycle with all edges negative. It is neither undirected, nor structurally balanced, nor acyclic; indeed no PNE exists.\\n- DAG: any orientation of a tree; the greedy reverse-topological assignment constructs a PNE.\\n- SCC mix: a sink SCC that is undirected plus a predecessor SCC that is structurally balanced; the SCC theorem applies.\\n\\nObstacles\\n- Structural balance is necessary for directed signed SCCs in the sense that a strongly connected component with a signed cycle of negative sign that cannot be switched away can destroy PNE existence (e.g., matching pennies-like motifs).\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Tighten SCC conditions: identify minimal SCC classes (beyond undirected/structurally balanced) that guarantee a PNE for any external field, e.g., exact potential on C up to additive separable terms, or classes with acyclic best-response graphs.\\n- Algorithmics: linear-time PNE construction for DAGs; polynomial-time via SCC decomposition with per-SCC solvers (potential maximization or lattice-theoretic fixed points).\\n\"\n}",
