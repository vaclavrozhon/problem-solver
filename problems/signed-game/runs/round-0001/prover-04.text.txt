Ideas
- We isolate graph-theoretic classes for which every signed coordination game with utilities u_i(x)=h_i x_i + x_i∑_j W_{ij}x_j (binary actions x_i∈{±1}) admits a pure Nash equilibrium (PNE), independently of h.
- We also give a compositional existence theorem along the DAG of strongly connected components (SCCs). Counterexamples show why negative directed cycles fall outside these classes.

Results and proofs
1) Undirected signed graphs (exact potential)
Claim. If W is symmetric (undirected network), then a PNE exists for all h.
Proof. Define Φ(x)= 1/2∑_{i,j}W_{ij}x_i x_j + ∑_i h_i x_i. If x,y differ only at i with y_i=−x_i, then Φ(y)−Φ(x)=2(h_i+∑_jW_{ij}x_j)x_i= u_i(y)−u_i(x). Hence Φ is an exact potential. A finite exact potential game admits a maximizer x*, which is a PNE. ∎

2) Structurally balanced signed digraphs (gauge to supermodular)
Definition. G is structurally balanced if V can be bipartitioned V=V_1⊔V_2 with W_{ij}≥0 on edges inside V_q and W_{ij}≤0 on edges between V_1 and V_2.
Equivalent formulation. There exists σ∈{±1}^V such that W'=[σ]W[σ] is entrywise nonnegative on edges.
Theorem. If G is structurally balanced, then a PNE exists for all h.
Proof. Consider the change of variables y=[σ]x. Then u_i(x)=u_i^{[σ]}(y)=h_i^{[σ]}y_i + y_i∑_j W'_{ij}y_j with W'≥0. This is a (possibly directed) coordination game, hence supermodular: for x≤y, the discrete slope δ_i(y)−δ_i(x)=2∑_j W'_{ij}(y_j−x_j)≥0. Finite supermodular games have a PNE by Tarski’s fixed-point theorem. Mapping back gives a PNE of the original game. ∎

3) Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)
Theorem. If the directed graph (i→j whenever W_{ij}≠0) is acyclic, then a PNE exists for all h and W.
Proof. Take a topological ordering v_1,…,v_n with edges i→j implying i<j. Assign actions in reverse order t=n,…,1. When choosing x_{v_t} set it to a best reply to already assigned out-neighbors {j: v_t→j}. Since u_{v_t} depends only on those out-neighbors and h_{v_t}, later choices x_{v_s} with s<t do not affect u_{v_t}. By induction, the final profile is a best reply for every player. ∎

4) SCC-wise composition
Let C_1,…,C_m be the SCCs and let 𝒢̂ be the condensation DAG. For S⊆V define the restricted game on S with external field h^S = h_S + W_{S, V\S} x_{V\S} (constants once x_{V\S} is fixed).
Theorem (SCC existence). Suppose for every SCC C, the induced subgraph G[C] is either (a) undirected (W_{ij}=W_{ji} on C) or (b) structurally balanced. Then a PNE exists for all h.
Proof. Process SCCs in reverse topological order on 𝒢̂. If C is a sink, nodes in C have no out-edges leaving C, so their utilities depend only on x_C and h_C; by (a) or (b) the restricted game on C admits a PNE x_C. Inductively, assume x is fixed on all SCCs that C points to; this turns those out-edges into a fixed h^C. By (a) or (b), the restricted game on C with field h^C has a PNE; fix it. Utilities of already processed SCCs depend only on their out-neighbors (already fixed), so they remain best replies. At termination, all players are best replying. ∎

5) Cohesive balanced cores (mixed graphs)
Let V=R⊔S. Suppose G[R] is structurally balanced and choose τ∈{±1}^R with τ_i W_{ij} τ_j ≥ 0 for i,j∈R (i.e., [τ]-transform makes R unsigned). If for all i∈R
w_i^{R} + τ_i h_i ≥ w_i^{S}  (cohesiveness),
then fixing x_R=τ is a best reply for every i∈R against any x_S. If, in addition, the subgame on S with field h^S=h_S+W_{S,R}τ admits a PNE (e.g., because G[S] is undirected or structurally balanced), the whole game admits a PNE with x_R=τ. This recovers and generalizes known “robust consensus/polarization” existence results.

Examples
- Failure (no PNE): the directed 3-cycle with all edges negative. It is neither undirected, nor structurally balanced, nor acyclic; indeed no PNE exists.
- DAG: any orientation of a tree; the greedy reverse-topological assignment constructs a PNE.
- SCC mix: a sink SCC that is undirected plus a predecessor SCC that is structurally balanced; the SCC theorem applies.

Obstacles
- Structural balance is necessary for directed signed SCCs in the sense that a strongly connected component with a signed cycle of negative sign that cannot be switched away can destroy PNE existence (e.g., matching pennies-like motifs).

Next steps
- Tighten SCC conditions: identify minimal SCC classes (beyond undirected/structurally balanced) that guarantee a PNE for any external field, e.g., exact potential on C up to additive separable terms, or classes with acyclic best-response graphs.
- Algorithmics: linear-time PNE construction for DAGs; polynomial-time via SCC decomposition with per-SCC solvers (potential maximization or lattice-theoretic fixed points).
