  "summary_md": "Round results identify graph classes that guarantee existence (and often BR-reachability/stability) of pure Nash equilibria in binary signed-network coordination (SNC) games. Main guarantees: undirected graphs (exact potential), unsigned graphs (supermodular), structurally balanced graphs (gauge to unsigned), DAG dependency digraphs (backward induction yields a PNE and BR-path), and SCC composition (if every SCC is \u201cuniversally PNE-admitting\u201d under arbitrary external fields \u2014 e.g., undirected or structurally balanced \u2014 then the full game admits a PNE constructed by solving SCCs from sinks upward). Additional sufficient conditions: cohesive-core bounds (w_R + \u03c4\u00b7h \u2265 w_S) produce consensus/polarized PNE when the S-subgame admits an NE; weight-dominance |h_i|>\u2211_j|W_ij| yields a strict PNE. Stability uses (h^-,h^+)-indecomposability to obtain BR-reachability of consensus/polarized equilibria and (when S-subgames are BR-stable) globally BR-stable NE sets. Counterexamples: 2-node discoordination and all-negative directed 3-cycle (no PNE). Next steps: classify universally PNE-admitting SCCs; give polynomial-time checker and end-to-end algorithm; integrate cohesive-core criteria into SCC pipeline.
