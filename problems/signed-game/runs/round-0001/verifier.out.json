  "feedback_md": "Overall, the provers converged on a coherent set of sufficient graph-theoretic conditions guaranteeing pure Nash equilibria (PNE) in signed network coordination (SNC) games with binary actions. The core modeling convention (dependency arc i\u2192j iff W_ij \u2260 0 so u_i depends only on its out-neighbors) is consistently used. I audited each class and proof sketch.\n\nSound results (with correct reasoning):\n- Undirected (W symmetric): exact potential; PNE exist. The potential \u03a6(x)=1/2\u2211_ij W_ij x_i x_j + \u2211_i h_i x_i is correct. Citing Monderer\u2013Shapley and the paper\u2019s Proposition is appropriate. The note about a BR-stable subset for undirected cases matches the paper (Catalano et al.).\n- Unsigned (W \u2265 0): supermodular via increasing differences; PNE exist; the NE set is a lattice. BR-reachability follows via I-path arguments (binary actions imply I-paths are BR-paths).\n- Structurally balanced: the gauge transform [\u03c3]W[\u03c3] \u2265 0 is equivalent to structural balance as defined. Mapping equilibria back via x = [\u03c3]y is correct; thus PNE exist.\n- DAG dependency digraph: The backward induction argument is correct and exploits the orientation that u_i depends only on out-neighbors. The constructed profile is a PNE and is BR-reachable by mimicking the order.\n- SCC-wise composition: Processing SCCs in reverse topological order is valid because players depend only on out-neighbors inside their SCC and in later SCCs. If each SCC admits a PNE for every external field (true for undirected or structurally balanced SCCs), concatenating yields a global PNE; the BR-path concatenation is valid.\n- Cohesive core conditions (R,S split): The inequalities w_i^R + a h_i \u2265 w_i^S (or \u03c4-variant) correctly make the target consensus/polarization a best response for all i\u2208R; existence in S under frozen R follows (undirected/structurally balanced S), hence a global PNE. Weight-dominance |h_i|>\u2211_j|W_ij| also correctly gives a strict PNE x=sgn(h).\n\nMinor issues to fix/clarify:\n- Be explicit that the structural balance definition here is directed: W_ij\u22650 within parts and \u22640 across parts; then \u03c3_i=+1 on one part, \u22121 on the other yields [\u03c3]W[\u03c3]\u22650. This differs from classic undirected Harary balance; please state the convention up front.\n- When claiming \u201cglobally BR-reachable\u201d sets for supermodular games, point out we use I-path reachability (Tarski/Topkis) plus binary actions so I-paths become BR-paths; avoid overclaiming unconditional BR-convergence.\n- In the SCC result, emphasize the \u201cuniversally PNE-admitting under arbitrary external fields\u201d property is the real requirement; undirected and structurally balanced are examples, but not necessarily exhaustive.\n- Ensure all counterexamples use h=0 and clearly state orientation i\u2192j iff W_ij\u22600 to avoid confusion.\n\nNext steps:\n- Characterize the maximal class of \u201cuniversally PNE-admitting\u201d SCCs beyond undirected/structurally balanced (e.g., exact potential polymatrix blocks, other monotone transformations).\n- Give a polynomial-time checker for \u201cNE-guaranteed SCCs for all external fields.\u201d\n- Explore necessary conditions (signed-cycle obstructions) for PNE nonexistence in strongly connected components.\n- Document algorithm: detect DAG; else decompose into SCCs; test each SCC; if all are NE-guaranteed, construct a PNE by reverse topological induction; otherwise, search for cohesive cores.\n",

The dependency arc i\u2192j is present iff W_{ij}\u22600, so u_i depends only on its out-neighbors.\n\nLemma 1 (Undirected \u21d2 exact potential). If W is symmetric, the game is an exact potential game with \u03a6(x)=1/2\u2211_{i,j} W_{ij} x_i x_j + \u2211_i h_i x_i. Hence a PNE exists.\nProof. If x,y differ only at i with y_i=\u2212x_i, \u03a6(y)\u2212\u03a6(x)=2(h_i+\u2211_j W_{ij}x_j)x_i = u_i(y)\u2212u_i(x). Finite exact potential games admit PNE.\n\nLemma 2 (Unsigned \u21d2 supermodular). If W_{ij}\u22650 for all i,j, then for \u03b4_i(x)=u_i(+1,x_{\u2212i})\u2212u_i(\u22121,x_{\u2212i})=2h_i+2\u2211_j W_{ij}x_j and x\u2264y, \u03b4_i(y)\u2212\u03b4_i(x)=2\u2211_j W_{ij}(y_j\u2212x_j)\u22650, so the game has increasing differences and admits a PNE.\n\nLemma 3 (Gauge transform and Nash correspondence). For \u03c3\u2208{\u00b11}^V, define [\u03c3] diagonal, W^{[\u03c3]}=[\u03c3]W[\u03c3], h^{[\u03c3]}=[\u03c3]h. Then u_i^{[\u03c3]}(x)=u_i([\u03c3]x). Consequently, y is a PNE in the [\u03c3]-transformed game iff x=[\u03c3]y is a PNE in the original game.\nProof. u_i^{[\u03c3]}(x)=x_i(\u2211_j W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij}x_j)+h^{[\u03c3]}_i x_i = u_i([\u03c3]x). Best-response sets transform via multiplication by \u03c3_i.\n\nLemma 4 (Directed structural balance \u21d4 unsigned via gauge). Suppose V admits a bipartition V=V_1\u2294V_2 with W_{ij}\u22650 for i,j in the same part and W_{ij}\u22640 across parts. Let \u03c3_i=+1 on V_1, \u03c3_i=\u22121 on V_2. Then W^{[\u03c3]}=[\u03c3]W[\u03c3] is entrywise nonnegative. Conversely, if \u2203\u03c3 with W^{[\u03c3]}\u22650, the induced bipartition by \u03c3 has nonnegative within-part and nonpositive across-part weights.\n\nTheorem 1 (DAGs guarantee PNE). If the dependency digraph is acyclic, then for any W,h the game admits a PNE; moreover a BR-path to it exists.\nProof. Let v_1,\u2026,v_n be a topological order with i\u2192j \u21d2 i<j. For k=n,\u2026,1, pick x_{v_k}\u2208argmax_{a\u2208{\u00b11}} a(h_{v_k}+\u2211_{j>k}W_{v_k j}x_{v_j}). Each u_{v_k} depends only on x_{v_j} with j>k, which are already fixed, so x_{v_k} is a best response in the final profile. Updating players in order n,n\u22121,\u2026,1 yields a BR-path to the constructed PNE.\n\nTheorem 2 (SCC-wise composition). Let C_1,\u2026,C_m be the strongly connected components (SCCs) of the dependency digraph ordered so edges go only from C_k to C_\u2113 with k<\u2113. Suppose each induced subgame on C_k admits a PNE for every external field (equivalently here: each C_k is either undirected or structurally balanced). Then the full game admits a PNE; a BR-path exists.\nProof. Proceed by reverse topological order. For C_m (a sink SCC), utilities of i\u2208C_m depend only on x_{C_m} and h, so by the hypothesis on C_m there exists a PNE x^*_{C_m}. Suppose x^*_{C_{k+1}},\u2026,x^*_{C_m} fixed. For i\u2208C_k, u_i(x)=x_i(\u2211_{j\u2208C_k}W_{ij}x_j) + x_i(h_i+\u2211_{j\u2209C_k}W_{ij}x^*_j). Treating f^{(k)}=h_{C_k}+W_{C_k,>k}x^*_{>k} as an external field, by the hypothesis on C_k there is a PNE x^*_{C_k}. Concatenate x^*=(x^*_{C_1},\u2026,x^*_{C_m}). For i\u2208C_k, u_i depends only on x_{C_k} and on x in later SCCs, which are exactly those fixed when x^*_{C_k} was chosen; hence each i is best responding in x^*. A BR-path is obtained by concatenating BR-paths inside C_m,C_{m\u22121},\u2026,C_1, holding later components fixed at each stage.\n\nCorollary 2.1. If each SCC is undirected (exact potential) or structurally balanced (via Lemma 4 and Lemma 2), then the hypothesis of Theorem 2 holds, so a PNE exists and is BR-reachable.\n\nRemark. The DAG case is the special case when all SCCs are singletons. Lemma 4 plus Lemma 3 ensures structurally balanced components remain PNE-admitting under arbitrary external fields.\n\nTheorem 3 (Weight-dominance). If |h_i|>\u2211_j |W_{ij}| \u2200i, then x_i=sgn(h_i) defines a strict PNE.\nProof. For any x_{\u2212i}, the sign maximizing u_i is sgn(h_i+\u2211_j W_{ij} x_j)=sgn(h_i), because |\u2211_j W_{ij} x_j|<|h_i|. Hence each player has a unique best response equal to sgn(h_i)."

The dependency arc i\u2192j is present iff W_{ij}\u22600, so u_i depends only on its out-neighbors.\n\n1) Directed acyclic dependency graphs (DAGs)\nTheorem (DAG \u21d2 PNE). If the dependency digraph is acyclic, then for any real weights W and bias vector h, the game admits a PNE. Moreover, a best-response (BR) path to it exists.\nProof. Take a topological order v_1,\u2026,v_n with i\u2192j \u21d2 i<j. Construct x by backward induction: for k=n,\u2026,1 pick x_{v_k}\u2208argmax_{a\u2208{\u00b11}} a(h_{v_k}+\u2211_{j>k}W_{v_k j}x_{v_j}).

Updating players in order n,n\u22121,\u2026,1 yields a BR-path to this PNE.\n\n2) SCC-wise composition under per-component PNE admissibility\nDefinition (Universally PNE-admitting component). An induced subgame on U\u2286V is universally PNE-admitting if for every external field f\u2208\u211d^U the game with utilities u_i(y)=y_i(\u2211_{j\u2208U}W_{ij}y_j+f_i) admits a PNE.\nExamples. (a) Undirected W_{ij}=W_{ji} on U: exact potential \u21d2 PNE for all f. (b) Structurally balanced on U: \u2203\u03c3_U with [\u03c3_U]W_{UU}[\u03c3_U]\u22650; after y\u21a6[\u03c3_U]y the game is unsigned (supermodular) \u21d2 PNE for all f; mapping back preserves PNE.\n\nTheorem (SCC composition \u21d2 PNE). Let C_1,\u2026,C_m be the SCCs of the dependency digraph ordered so edges go only from C_k to C_\u2113 with k<\u2113. If each induced subgame on C_k is universally PNE-admitting (e.g., undirected or structurally balanced), then for any W,h the full game admits a PNE. A BR-path exists.\nProof. Process SCCs in reverse topological order. For the sink C_m, u_i depends only on x_{C_m} and h, so pick a PNE x^*_{C_m}. Suppose x^*_{C_{k+1}},\u2026,x^*_{C_m} are fixed. For i\u2208C_k, u_i(x)=x_i(\u2211_{j\u2208C_k}W_{ij}x_j)+x_i(h_i+\u2211_{j\u2209C_k}W_{ij}x^*_j). Treat f^{(k)}=h_{C_k}+W_{C_k,>k}x^*_{>k} as an external field. By the hypothesis on C_k, choose a PNE x^*_{C_k}. The concatenation x^*=(x^*_{C_1},\u2026,x^*_{C_m}) is a PNE since each i\u2208C_k depends only on x_{C_k} and later components (fixed when x^*_{C_k} was chosen). Concatenating BR-paths inside C_m,C_{m\u22121},\u2026,C_1 yields a global BR-path.\n\nDiscussion and relevance\n- The DAG result is a clean, graph-theoretic guarantee that covers arbitrary signs and weights.\n- The SCC composition theorem modularizes PNE existence: it suffices to certify each SCC as universally PNE-admitting (e.g., undirected or structurally balanced). This strictly includes DAGs (all SCCs are singletons) and globally undirected/structurally balanced graphs as special cases, and provides a constructive method to build a PNE by solving SCCs from sinks upward."
