=== SYSTEM ===
You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md, proofs.md, and output.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers
- notes.md (informal progress & exploratory work so far)
- proofs.md (rigorous proofs & detailed mathematics so far)
- output.md (main results found so far)

**Three-tier file system guidelines**:
- **notes.md**: Readable, log of exploratory work, intuitions, failed attempts, ideas. Prefer appending. Replace only if old notes are clearly misleading. It should be self-contained: In particular, reading it should make sense without knowing the output of provers in past rounds. 

- **proofs.md**: Complete rigorous mathematical proofs with full details. Think twice before adding anything. Contains proven lemmas, theorems, and detailed derivations. Only add mathematically verified content here.
- **output.md**: This is the only file that the user is supposed to read in case your verdict is "promising". It has to be self-contained. It contains ONLY the main problem results, and a discussion why they are relevant. It is extremely selective. Think twice before promoting proofs from proofs.md to output.md. Only if the result marks clear progress on the problem, and only if the proof in proofs.md has been thoroughly vetted by provers and you, it can join output.md. Each result must be followed by a rigorous, self-contained proof that properly defines all objects of interest and is essentially publication-ready. 

Tasks:
1) Audit rigor: identify unjustified steps, false statements, missing lemmas; produce minimal counterexamples.
2) Triage value: separate genuine progress from noise.
3) Guide next steps: propose what provers should try next.

Definitions.
• A signed network is a graph G = (V, E) where each edge has a
weight wuv ∈ R (can be negative). Each vertex i ∈ V is a player
who chooses an action xi ∈ {−1, +1}.
• The utility of i ∈ V is given by a function that depends on the
weights and actions. Typical examples:
• pure anti-coordination (all weights = −1):
ui(xi) = |j ∈ N(i) : xj ̸= xi|
• signed payoff (binary actions xi ∈ {±1}):
ui(xi) = \sum_{j∈N(i)} (w_{ij} \cdot x_i \cdot x_j)

• A strategy X is a pure Nash equilibrium (or stable coloring) if
no vertex can change its action and strictly increase its utility.

Question: Identify graphs that guarantee the existence of a pure
Nash equilibrium in signed coordination games.

Ideas
- We list graph classes that (for all weights consistent with the class and all biases h) guarantee existence of a pure Nash equilibrium (PNE) in signed network coordination (SNC) games with binary actions.
- We also state a constructive new class (acyclic dependency digraphs) and an SCC-wise decomposition result. Finally, we recall “cohesive core” conditions ensuring existence with a specific structure of the equilibrium.

Model reminder
- Players i ∈ V choose x_i ∈ {±1}. Payoffs u_i(x) = h_i x_i + x_i ∑_j W_{ij} x_j.
- Directed signed graph: (i,j) ∈ E ⇔ W_{ij} ≠ 0. Player i’s payoff depends on her out-neighbors j (the j with W_{ij} ≠ 0).

Results (statements and succinct proofs)
1) Undirected networks (W = W′)
Claim: Every SNC game on an undirected network admits a PNE.
Reason: The game is an exact potential game with potential Φ(x) = 1/2 ∑_{i,j} W_{ij} x_i x_j + ∑_i h_i x_i. Finite exact potential games admit PNE (Monderer–Shapley). This is Proposition pr:pot_mixed(i,ii) in the provided paper.

2) Unsigned networks (W ≥ 0)
Claim: Every SNC game on an unsigned network admits a PNE.
Reason: The game exhibits increasing differences (supermodular). Hence PNE exist and the NE set is a nonempty lattice (Topkis). See Proposition prop:super-modular in the paper.

3) Structurally balanced networks
Definition: V = V_1 ⊔ V_2 such that W_{ij} ≥ 0 if i,j in same part; W_{ij} ≤ 0 if i ∈ V_q, j ∈ V_r, q ≠ r.
Claim: Every SNC game on a structurally balanced network admits a PNE.
Reason: There exists a gauge transform [σ] (diagonal with entries ±1) s.t. [σ]W[σ] ≥ 0 (unsigned). Apply (2) to the transformed game and map equilibria back (Lemma NashGauge). This is Proposition prop:structurally-balanced-equilibria in the paper.

4) Acyclic dependency digraphs (new)
Let G be a DAG with respect to the directed edges i→j where W_{ij} ≠ 0.
Claim: Every SNC game on a DAG admits a PNE (for any real weights and any h).
Proof (constructive): Process vertices in reverse topological order by repeatedly removing sinks. If i is a sink (no out-neighbors), set x_i ∈ argmax_{±1} h_i x_i (both if tie). Remove i and continue. When choosing x_i at some step, all j with W_{ij} ≠ 0 have already been fixed, so x_i ∈ argmax_{±1} x_i(h_i+∑_j W_{ij}x_j) is a best response to the current (and final) x_{-i}. Since later choices cannot change any out-neighbor of i, i remains a BR in the final profile. Thus the constructed x is a PNE.

5) SCC-wise decomposition (new)
Let the condensation of the digraph be a DAG of strongly connected components (SCCs) C_1,…,C_m, ordered so that edges go from C_r to C_s only if r < s. Suppose each SCC subgraph is either undirected or structurally balanced.
Claim: The SNC game admits a PNE.
Proof (induction over SCCs): Start from terminal SCC C_m. Since it has no outgoing edges, the game restricted to C_m has a PNE for any external field; true because: undirected ⇒ exact potential, or structurally balanced ⇒ gauge to unsigned ⇒ supermodular. Fix a PNE x^{(m)} on C_m. Move to C_{m-1}: its players face an external field equal to h_i plus ∑_{j∈C_s, s>m-1} W_{ij} x^{(s)}_j, a fixed vector. Again by the same reason (undirected or structurally balanced), C_{m-1} admits a PNE x^{(m-1)}. Continue backwards to C_1. The concatenation x = (x^{(1)},…,x^{(m)}) is a PNE on the whole graph because each player’s best-response condition depends only on out-neighbors inside its own SCC and in later SCCs, which have been fixed when choosing x^{(r)}.

6) Cohesive coordinating core (paper’s main existence theorem)
Let V = R ⊔ S. Assume G_R is unsigned (or more generally structurally balanced). Define the out-degree splits w_i^R = ∑_{j∈R} |W_{ij}|, w_i^S = ∑_{j∈S} |W_{ij}|.
- Unsigned core (consensus): If there exists a ∈ {±1} with w_i^R + a h_i ≥ w_i^S for all i∈R, and the S-restricted game with R frozen at a·1 has a PNE, then there exists a PNE with x_R = a·1. Special cases ensuring the S-restricted game has a PNE: G_S undirected (potential) or G_S structurally balanced (gauge to unsigned). This is Proposition prop:mixed1 and Corollaries th:mixed_existence1–2.
- Structurally balanced core (polarization): If τ ∈ {±1}^R makes G_R^{[τ]} unsigned and w_i^R + τ_i h_i ≥ w_i^S for all i∈R, and the S-restricted game with R frozen at τ has a PNE, then there exists a PNE with x_R = τ (Theorem theo:main-existence; corollaries as above for G_S).

Examples
- No PNE: 2-node “discoordination” (W_{12}>0,W_{21}<0) and 3-cycle of negative directed edges (both violate 1–6).
- DAG: a directed chain 1→2→3 with arbitrary signs/weights always has a PNE by reverse-topological construction.
- Mixed: Figures in the paper (e.g., Fig. 1 and Fig. 5 therein) satisfy cohesive-core conditions yielding equilibria with R at consensus/polarization.

Obstacles/limits
- The above are sufficient, not necessary. There are graphs outside 1–6 still admitting PNE for particular (W,h). Conversely, small cycles with antagonism can destroy existence.

Next steps
- Tighten the SCC criterion: identify the largest class of SCCs that admit PNE under arbitrary external fields (beyond undirected/structurally balanced), then combine through the condensation DAG.
- Explore minimal cohesiveness thresholds ensuring existence when S is “well-behaved” (potential/structurally balanced/DAG).
- Quantify robustness: perturbations of W within classes keep PNE existence; give explicit bounds.

Formal statements (for verifier)
Proposition A (DAG existence). Let G be a directed acyclic graph, W_{ij} ≠ 0 ⇔ (i,j) ∈ E, and h ∈ ℝ^V arbitrary. Then the SNC game admits a pure Nash equilibrium. Proof given above.

Proposition B (SCC decomposition). If every strongly connected component induces a subgraph that is undirected or structurally balanced, then the SNC game admits a pure Nash equilibrium. Proof by reverse topological induction, using existence on each SCC under arbitrary external fields (Propositions 1 and 3).

These complement the paper’s results (undirected, unsigned, structurally balanced; cohesive-core with undirected/structurally-balanced S).

Ideas
- We work with binary-action signed network coordination (SNC) games: u_i(x)=h_i x_i + x_i sum_j W_{ij} x_j on a directed signed graph G=(V,E,W).
- We identify graph classes for which a pure Nash equilibrium (PNE) is guaranteed, and give short, checkable proofs + counterexamples.

Class A. Undirected signed graphs (exact potential)
Claim A1. If W is symmetric (undirected graph), the game is an exact potential game with potential Φ(x)=1/2 sum_{i,j} W_{ij} x_i x_j + sum_i h_i x_i. Hence, PNE exist. Moreover, a nonempty BR-stable subset of PNE exists.
Sketch. Immediate from Monderer–Shapley; see Proposition in the paper.

Class B. Structurally balanced graphs (gauge to unsigned)
Definition. G is structurally balanced if V=V_1∪V_2, V_1∩V_2=∅, and W_{ij}≥0 for i,j∈V_q, and W_{ij}≤0 for i∈V_q, j∈V_r, q≠r.
Claim B1. G is structurally balanced iff ∃σ∈{±1}^V such that [σ]W[σ]≥0 (unsigned).
Claim B2. On such graphs, the SNC game is supermodular (after gauge), hence PNE exist; in fact the PNE set is globally BR-reachable.
Sketch. Lemma (gauge equivalence) and standard supermodular fixed-point arguments; see Proposition in the paper.

Class C. Acyclic influence graphs (DAG)
Let the influence digraph have an edge (i,j) iff W_{ij}≠0 (so i’s payoff depends on j). Suppose this digraph is acyclic.
Theorem C1 (Backward induction on DAG). If the influence digraph is acyclic, a PNE exists for every W,h (arbitrary signs), and is BR-reachable.
Proof. Order vertices topologically so W_{ij}=0 for j≤i. Pick x_n∈argmax_{±1} h_n x_n, then x_{n-1}∈argmax h_{n-1}x_{n-1}+x_{n-1}∑_{j>n-1}W_{n-1,j}x_j, and so on down to 1. Because u_i depends only on j>i, each choice is a best response to the final profile; no later updates affect u_i. This constructs a PNE. A BR-path exists by mimicking this construction.

Class D. SCC-by-SCC composition
Let C_1,…,C_m be the strongly connected components (SCCs) of the influence digraph, ordered so that if ∃i∈C_k,j∈C_ℓ with W_{ij}≠0 then k<ℓ (edges go from earlier to later).
Theorem D1 (Existence via SCCs). Suppose that for each SCC C_k, the restricted SNC game on C_k admits a PNE for every external field (equivalently: G_{C_k} is undirected or structurally balanced). Then the whole game has a PNE; one is BR-reachable.
Proof. Induct on k from m down to 1. For C_m, there are no outgoing edges, so utilities do not depend on outside; by assumption there is a PNE x^*_C_m. Freeze it. For C_{m-1}, the outside actions only enter as an external field h^{(x^*_{>m-1})}; by assumption, the subgame on C_{m-1} has a PNE. Continue. Concatenate BR-paths within each SCC to obtain a global BR-path. The terminal profile is a PNE of the full game.
Remarks.
- This strictly generalizes Class A (every SCC undirected) and Class B (every SCC structurally balanced) and includes Class C (all SCCs are singletons).

Class E. Cohesive coordinating blocks
Let V=R∪S with R∩S=∅. Write w_i^B=∑_{j∈B}|W_{ij}|.
Unsigned R (coordination in R). If G_R is unsigned and there exists a∈{±1} such that for all i∈R: w_i^R + a h_i ≥ w_i^S, and the S-subgame with R frozen to a1 has a PNE, then the full game has a PNE with x_R=a1. This holds in particular if G_S is undirected or structurally balanced (their subgames admit PNE for every external field). See Proposition/Theorem in the paper.
Structurally balanced R (polarization). If G_R is structurally balanced, pick τ∈{±1}^R with τ_i W_{ij} τ_j ≥0 on R×R; if w_i^R + τ_i h_i ≥ w_i^S ∀i∈R and the S-subgame with R frozen to τ has a PNE (e.g., G_S undirected or structurally balanced), then the full game has a PNE with x_R=τ (polarized on R).

Examples
1) DAG with mixed signs. 1→2→3, weights W_{12}=-3,W_{23}=2, others 0, h=(0,1,-2). By Theorem C1, choose x_3=sgn(h_3)=-1, x_2=sgn(h_2+W_{23}x_3)=sgn(1-2)=-1, x_1=sgn(h_1+W_{12}x_2)=sgn(3)=+1. This is a PNE; a BR-path follows the same order.
2) Two SCCs. C_1={1,2} with mutual negative links (structurally balanced), C_2={3} (singleton). Edges only from 1,2 to 3. Solve C_2 first (trivial), then C_1 (structurally balanced ⇒ PNE exists for any field). Global PNE exists and is BR-reachable (Theorem D1).
3) Counterexamples. (i) 2-node “discoordination” with one positive and one negative arc has no PNE; it fails Class A/B and contains a 2-cycle (so not Class C). (ii) 3-cycle with all negative arcs has no PNE; not structurally balanced, not a DAG.

Obstacles/limits
- Classes A–E are sufficient, not necessary. There exist graphs outside these classes that admit PNE for specific h,W.
- Global BR-reachability or BR-stability may fail even when PNE exist (cf. examples in the paper).

Next steps
- Tighten Class D: characterize SCCs that are “universally PNE-admitting” (for all external fields) beyond undirected/structurally balanced; e.g., other exact-potential polymatrix structures.
- Explore minimal cut/cohesion relaxations in Class E (only boundary nodes of R may need w_i^R + τ_i h_i ≥ w_i^S).
- Algorithmic pipeline: (i) check DAG ⇒ PNE; else (ii) decompose into SCCs, test each for undirected/struct. balanced; if yes ⇒ PNE by D1; else (iii) try to find cohesive R and apply E.

Proofs (details suitable for proofs.md)
Proof of Theorem C1. Let π be a topological order with W_{ij}=0 for j≤i. Define x_n∈argmax_{±1} u_n(x) since u_n=h_n x_n. Having fixed x_{n},…,x_{i+1}, define x_i∈argmax_{±1} h_i x_i + x_i∑_{j>i}W_{ij}x_j. Then u_i depends only on x_{>i}, so x_i is a best response in the final profile. Hence the constructed x is a PNE. A BR-path is obtained by letting players update in the order n,n−1,…,1.

Proof of Theorem D1. Let the SCC condensation be C_1,…,C_m with edges from k to ℓ only if k<ℓ. For k=m, the restricted game on C_m is independent of outside actions (rows to outside are zero), and, by hypothesis, admits a PNE x^*_{C_m}. Inductively, suppose x^*_{C_{k+1}},…,x^*_{C_m} are fixed. Then for i∈C_k, the utility is u_i(x)=x_i∑_{j∈C_k}W_{ij}x_j + x_i( h_i + ∑_{j>k}W_{ij}x^*_j ). Thus the C_k-subgame is an SNC game on G_{C_k} with external field h^{(k)}=h_{C_k}+W_{C_k,>k}x^*_{>k}. By hypothesis it has a PNE x^*_{C_k}. Concatenating yields a PNE x^*. A BR-path is constructed by running BR paths within C_m,C_{m-1},…,C_1 in this order; C_m’s utilities do not depend on outside, so updates elsewhere do not invalidate previous best responses.

Proofs for Classes A,B,E follow the propositions/theorems already in the paper; in E the inequalities w_i^R + a h_i ≥ w_i^S or w_i^R + τ_i h_i ≥ w_i^S ensure R’s consensus/polarization is a best response for all i∈R; existence in S is guaranteed if G_S is undirected or structurally balanced.

Summary (for output.md)
- PNE exist on: (i) undirected signed graphs; (ii) structurally balanced graphs (after gauge); (iii) acyclic influence graphs (DAGs); (iv) graphs whose SCCs are each undirected or structurally balanced (compose by reverse topological order); (v) graphs containing a cohesive coordinating block R satisfying w_i^R + a h_i ≥ w_i^S (or polarized τ) and with S-subgame admitting PNE (e.g., S undirected or structurally balanced).
- Classes (iii)–(v) are constructive and yield BR-paths to a PNE.

Ideas

We collect graph-theoretic conditions under which a signed network coordination (SNC) game with binary actions admits at least one pure Nash equilibrium (PNE). We also add two new, simple-to-check sufficient classes (acyclic dependency graphs; block-triangular assembly via strongly connected components) with short proofs.

Model reminder. Players i∈V choose xi∈{±1}. Utilities: ui(x)=hixi+∑j Wij xixj. Edge (i,j) is present iff Wij≠0 and indicates that i’s utility depends on j’s action.

A. Known sufficient graph classes (with short proofs or references)

A1) Undirected signed graphs (W=W′) ⇒ exact potential game ⇒ PNE exists.
Claim. If W=W′ then the game is an exact potential game with potential Φ(x)=1/2 ∑i,j Wij xixj + ∑i hi xi. Hence a PNE exists (finite potential games). Proof: For any i and fixed x−i, ui(·,x−i) increments match Φ’s increments by symmetry (standard; see Monderer–Shapley 1996). Thus at least one global maximizer of Φ is a PNE.

A2) Unsigned graphs (Wij≥0) ⇒ supermodular ⇒ PNE exists.
Claim. If Wij≥0 for all i,j then the game is supermodular (increasing differences). Hence a PNE exists (Tarski). Proof sketch: δi(x)=ui(+1,x−i)−ui(−1,x−i)=2hi+2∑j Wij xj; if Wij≥0 and x≤y then δi(y)−δi(x)=2∑j Wij (yj−xj)≥0, giving increasing differences; existence follows.

A3) Structurally balanced signed graphs ⇒ gauge-transform to unsigned ⇒ PNE exists.
Claim. If there exists a partition V=V1⊔V2 such that weights are nonnegative within parts and nonpositive across, then there is a diagonal signature [σ] with entries σi∈{±1} for which W[σ]=[σ]W[σ]≥0. The transformed game is unsigned, so it has a PNE; mapping back by xi←σi yi gives a PNE for the original game. (Altafini 2013.)

B. Cohesive-subgraph guarantees (robust consensus/polarization inside a subgraph)
Let V=R⊔S. Assume GR is unsigned (coordination) or structurally balanced (after some τ∈{±1}R, GR becomes unsigned). Define weighted out-degrees w_i^B=∑j∈B |Wij|.

B1) Existence with R at consensus (unsigned GR).
Assume for some a∈{±1}:
(1) w_i^R + a h_i ≥ w_i^S for all i∈R, and
(2) the S-restricted game with y=a1R has a PNE (e.g., GS undirected or structurally balanced).
Then the full game has a PNE x* with x*R=a 1R. Proof idea: (1) makes a a best response for every i∈R regardless of z∈{±1}S, while (2) supplies z*∈NES^(a1). Then (a1,z*) is a PNE.

B2) Existence with R polarized (structurally balanced GR).
Assume there is τ∈{±1}R such that τi Wij τj≥0 for i,j∈R (so GR becomes unsigned under [τ]). If
(1′) w_i^R + τi h_i ≥ w_i^S for all i∈R, and
(2′) the S-restricted game with y=τ has a PNE (again true if GS undirected or structurally balanced),
then the game has a PNE x* with x*R=τ.

These are precisely the existence theorems in the provided paper (Proposition 1 and Theorem 1 there, plus corollaries), specialized to binary actions.

C. New sufficient graph classes (simple, checkable)

C1) Acyclic dependency graphs (DAGs) ⇒ PNE exists (for any signs/weights).
Define the dependency digraph with arcs i→j iff Wij≠0 (i’s utility depends on j). If this digraph is acyclic, a topological ordering v1,…,vn exists with edges only from lower to higher indices. Then W is strictly upper-triangular in that order: ui depends only on xj for j>i. Construct x by backward induction:
• Choose xn∈argmax ui(xn) (depends only on hn). For k=n−1,…,1, choose xk∈argmax uk(xk,xk+1,…,xn).
Because ui does not depend on x1,…,xi−1, each chosen xk remains a best response in the final profile. Hence the constructed x is a PNE. This covers all DAGs irrespective of signs.

C2) Block-triangular assembly via SCCs (componentwise existence ⇒ global existence).
Let C1,…,CK be the strongly connected components (SCCs) in a topological order of the condensation DAG (edges only from Ca to Cb with a<b). Suppose each induced subgame on Ck is from a family that admits a PNE for every external field (e.g., undirected, unsigned, or structurally balanced). Then the full game has a PNE.
Proof. Start from sink CK: its players’ utilities depend only on xCK and biases; pick any PNE xCK. Move to CK−1: its utilities depend on xCK only through affine shifts in hk; by hypothesis the restricted game on CK−1 has a PNE; pick xCK−1; iterate upward. The concatenated profile x is a PNE globally. Note this strictly generalizes C1) (DAG = each SCC is a singleton), and also composes the known classes A1–A3 under forward-only inter-component influence.

Examples

1) DAG example. Chain 1→2→3 with arbitrary signed weights. Order (1,2,3). Choose x3 to maximize u3 (depends only on h3). Then choose x2 best responding to x3, then x1 to (x2,x3). The resulting x is a PNE.

2) SCC assembly example. Two components C1 and C2 with edges only C1→C2. Suppose G[C1] is undirected (any signs), G[C2] is structurally balanced. Pick a PNE on C2; treat its effect as an external field on C1 and pick a PNE on C1. Their product is a PNE.

Obstacles and limits

• Cycles of pure anti-coordination can destroy existence (3-cycle all −1 weights has no PNE). This violates A3, C1, C2 (since its SCC is not from a guaranteed family).
• The cohesive-subgraph conditions (B1–B2) require an equilibrium in the complement S when R is frozen. This holds if GS is undirected or structurally balanced; otherwise, it may fail.

Next steps (auditable targets)

• Tighten C2: characterize largest per-SCC families closed under external-field perturbations that guarantee PNE.
• Develop efficient checks: (i) test structural balance on SCCs via a signed 2-coloring; (ii) find maximal cohesive R satisfying w_i^R + τi h_i ≥ w_i^S.
• Empirical stress tests: generate random signed DAGs and SCC-assemblies; verify backward-induction PNE construction and the B1–B2 inequalities algorithmically.

Formal statements (for proofs.md)

Lemma (Undirected ⇒ potential). If W=W′, Φ(x)=1/2 ∑i,j Wij xixj + ∑i hi xi is an exact potential; hence a PNE exists.

Lemma (Unsigned ⇒ supermodular). If Wij≥0, the game has increasing differences and thus a PNE.

Lemma (Structural balance ⇒ gauge to unsigned). If ∃σ∈{±1}V with [σ]W[σ]≥0, then a PNE exists and pulls back to a PNE of the original game via x←[σ]y.

Theorem (Cohesive R, unsigned). If V=R⊔S, GR unsigned, ∃a∈{±1} with w_i^R + a h_i ≥ w_i^S ∀i∈R, and the S-restricted game with y=a1R has a PNE, then the full game has a PNE with xR=a1R.

Theorem (Cohesive R, structurally balanced). If V=R⊔S, ∃τ∈{±1}R with τi Wij τj≥0 on R, w_i^R + τi h_i ≥ w_i^S ∀i∈R, and the S-restricted game with y=τ has a PNE, then the full game has a PNE with xR=τ.

Lemma (DAG ⇒ PNE). If the dependency digraph is acyclic, a PNE exists by backward induction along a topological order.

Theorem (SCC assembly). If the condensation DAG is ordered C1,…,CK and each subgame on Ck (with arbitrary external field) admits a PNE (e.g., undirected, unsigned, or structurally balanced), then the full game admits a PNE, constructible by solving components from sinks upward.

Ideas
- We isolate graph-theoretic classes for which every signed coordination game with utilities u_i(x)=h_i x_i + x_i∑_j W_{ij}x_j (binary actions x_i∈{±1}) admits a pure Nash equilibrium (PNE), independently of h.
- We also give a compositional existence theorem along the DAG of strongly connected components (SCCs). Counterexamples show why negative directed cycles fall outside these classes.

Results and proofs
1) Undirected signed graphs (exact potential)
Claim. If W is symmetric (undirected network), then a PNE exists for all h.
Proof. Define Φ(x)= 1/2∑_{i,j}W_{ij}x_i x_j + ∑_i h_i x_i. If x,y differ only at i with y_i=−x_i, then Φ(y)−Φ(x)=2(h_i+∑_jW_{ij}x_j)x_i= u_i(y)−u_i(x). Hence Φ is an exact potential. A finite exact potential game admits a maximizer x*, which is a PNE. ∎

2) Structurally balanced signed digraphs (gauge to supermodular)
Definition. G is structurally balanced if V can be bipartitioned V=V_1⊔V_2 with W_{ij}≥0 on edges inside V_q and W_{ij}≤0 on edges between V_1 and V_2.
Equivalent formulation. There exists σ∈{±1}^V such that W'=[σ]W[σ] is entrywise nonnegative on edges.
Theorem. If G is structurally balanced, then a PNE exists for all h.
Proof. Consider the change of variables y=[σ]x. Then u_i(x)=u_i^{[σ]}(y)=h_i^{[σ]}y_i + y_i∑_j W'_{ij}y_j with W'≥0. This is a (possibly directed) coordination game, hence supermodular: for x≤y, the discrete slope δ_i(y)−δ_i(x)=2∑_j W'_{ij}(y_j−x_j)≥0. Finite supermodular games have a PNE by Tarski’s fixed-point theorem. Mapping back gives a PNE of the original game. ∎

3) Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)
Theorem. If the directed graph (i→j whenever W_{ij}≠0) is acyclic, then a PNE exists for all h and W.
Proof. Take a topological ordering v_1,…,v_n with edges i→j implying i<j. Assign actions in reverse order t=n,…,1. When choosing x_{v_t} set it to a best reply to already assigned out-neighbors {j: v_t→j}. Since u_{v_t} depends only on those out-neighbors and h_{v_t}, later choices x_{v_s} with s<t do not affect u_{v_t}. By induction, the final profile is a best reply for every player. ∎

4) SCC-wise composition
Let C_1,…,C_m be the SCCs and let 𝒢̂ be the condensation DAG. For S⊆V define the restricted game on S with external field h^S = h_S + W_{S, V\S} x_{V\S} (constants once x_{V\S} is fixed).
Theorem (SCC existence). Suppose for every SCC C, the induced subgraph G[C] is either (a) undirected (W_{ij}=W_{ji} on C) or (b) structurally balanced. Then a PNE exists for all h.
Proof. Process SCCs in reverse topological order on 𝒢̂. If C is a sink, nodes in C have no out-edges leaving C, so their utilities depend only on x_C and h_C; by (a) or (b) the restricted game on C admits a PNE x_C. Inductively, assume x is fixed on all SCCs that C points to; this turns those out-edges into a fixed h^C. By (a) or (b), the restricted game on C with field h^C has a PNE; fix it. Utilities of already processed SCCs depend only on their out-neighbors (already fixed), so they remain best replies. At termination, all players are best replying. ∎

5) Cohesive balanced cores (mixed graphs)
Let V=R⊔S. Suppose G[R] is structurally balanced and choose τ∈{±1}^R with τ_i W_{ij} τ_j ≥ 0 for i,j∈R (i.e., [τ]-transform makes R unsigned). If for all i∈R
w_i^{R} + τ_i h_i ≥ w_i^{S}  (cohesiveness),
then fixing x_R=τ is a best reply for every i∈R against any x_S. If, in addition, the subgame on S with field h^S=h_S+W_{S,R}τ admits a PNE (e.g., because G[S] is undirected or structurally balanced), the whole game admits a PNE with x_R=τ. This recovers and generalizes known “robust consensus/polarization” existence results.

Examples
- Failure (no PNE): the directed 3-cycle with all edges negative. It is neither undirected, nor structurally balanced, nor acyclic; indeed no PNE exists.
- DAG: any orientation of a tree; the greedy reverse-topological assignment constructs a PNE.
- SCC mix: a sink SCC that is undirected plus a predecessor SCC that is structurally balanced; the SCC theorem applies.

Obstacles
- Structural balance is necessary for directed signed SCCs in the sense that a strongly connected component with a signed cycle of negative sign that cannot be switched away can destroy PNE existence (e.g., matching pennies-like motifs).

Next steps
- Tighten SCC conditions: identify minimal SCC classes (beyond undirected/structurally balanced) that guarantee a PNE for any external field, e.g., exact potential on C up to additive separable terms, or classes with acyclic best-response graphs.
- Algorithmics: linear-time PNE construction for DAGs; polynomial-time via SCC decomposition with per-SCC solvers (potential maximization or lattice-theoretic fixed points).

Ideas
- Provide two new sufficient graph-theoretic conditions that guarantee existence of pure Nash equilibria (PNE) in signed network coordination (SNC) games with binary actions:
  1) Acyclic directed graphs (DAGs).
  2) General directed graphs whose strongly connected components (SCCs) are each “good,” where “good” means: for any external field on that SCC, the restricted SNC game admits at least one PNE. This holds, in particular, if each SCC is undirected or structurally balanced.
- Both are constructive: equilibria can be built by backward induction on a suitable partial order (a topological order of the DAG, or of the condensation DAG of SCCs).

Proposition 1 (DAGs guarantee a PNE)
Let G = (V,E,W) be a directed acyclic graph. For any h ∈ R^V, the SNC game u_i(x) = h_i x_i + x_i ∑_j W_{ij} x_j with x_i ∈ {±1} has a pure Nash equilibrium.
Proof. Since G is a DAG, take a topological ordering v_1,…,v_n where every edge (v_p→v_q) satisfies p < q. Construct x by backward induction from k = n down to 1. When fixing x_{v_k}, all its out-neighbors lie in {v_{k+1},…,v_n} and have already been assigned; choose x_{v_k} ∈ argmax_{a∈{±1}} [ a( h_{v_k} + ∑_j W_{v_k j} x_j ) ]. This is a best response given the (already fixed) actions of all out-neighbors. Since u_{v_k} depends only on x_{v_k} and on its out-neighbors’ actions, later choices (for indices < k) cannot affect u_{v_k}. Thus, in the final profile, every player is playing a best response. Hence x is a PNE. ▢
Remarks:
- The construction yields a strict PNE whenever no tie occurs at any step, i.e., whenever |h_i + ∑_{j∈N^+_i} W_{ij} x_j| > 0 for all i.
- This is a purely graph-theoretic guarantee (holds for any real weights and any h).

Definition (Componentwise NE-guaranteed SCCs)
For a network G and U ⊆ V, say that G_U is NE-guaranteed if for every f ∈ R^U the restricted SNC game on U with utilities u_i(y) = y_i (∑_{j∈U} W_{ij} y_j + f_i) admits at least one PNE.
Two broad classes are NE-guaranteed:
- Undirected SCCs: by Proposition 1(i)-(ii) in the paper, such subgames are exact potential games for any f, hence admit PNE.
- Structurally balanced SCCs: by Lemma 2 and Proposition 4 in the paper, gauge-transform to an unsigned subgame (supermodular), which has a PNE for any f.

Theorem 2 (SCC-wise existence via condensation DAG)
Let G = (V,E,W) and let C^1,…,C^K be the SCCs of G. Suppose each G_{C^k} is NE-guaranteed (e.g., undirected or structurally balanced). Then for any h ∈ R^V the SNC game admits a pure Nash equilibrium.
Proof. Consider the condensation DAG of SCCs and choose a topological order in which all inter-component edges point from earlier to later components. Proceed from sinks to sources:
- Step t = K,K−1,…,1. Let S_t be the union of components strictly later than C^t. By construction there is no edge entering S_t from C^t (or earlier components), while edges may go from C^t to S_t. Assume x_{S_t} has been fixed in previous steps.
- Define an external field on C^t by f^{(t)} = h_{C^t} + W_{C^t,S_t} x_{S_t}.
- Since G_{C^t} is NE-guaranteed, there exists y^{(t)} ∈ {±1}^{C^t} that is a PNE of the restricted game on C^t with field f^{(t)}.
- Fix x_{C^t} := y^{(t)} and continue.
At termination, x ∈ {±1}^V is defined. If i ∈ C^t, its utility depends only on x_j for j in its out-neighbors, which lie in C^t ∪ S_t; these were exactly fixed when solving the restricted game on C^t with field f^{(t)}. Hence x_i is a best response in the full profile. Therefore x is a PNE. ▢
Corollaries and examples:
- All DAGs are covered as the special case where every SCC is a singleton (Corollary of Proposition 1).
- If each SCC is undirected (not necessarily symmetric between SCCs), a PNE exists. If each SCC is structurally balanced, a PNE exists. Mixed cases (some SCCs undirected, others structurally balanced) are allowed.
- This sharpens and modularizes existing results: global structural balance (the whole graph is structurally balanced) is a special case (single SCC) of the theorem; likewise, undirected graphs are a special case.

Algorithmic construction
- For DAGs: one backward pass along any topological order.
- For general graphs: compute SCCs and their condensation DAG; process SCCs from sinks upwards, solving each restricted subgame (exact potential if undirected; supermodular after gauge if structurally balanced) and fixing actions.

Further sufficient condition (weight-dominance, graph-independent)
If |h_i| > ∑_j |W_{ij}| for all i, then x^* = sign(h) is a strict PNE (unique best responses independent of neighbors). Proof: for any x_{-i}, the sign maximizing u_i is sign(h_i) since the interaction term has magnitude ≤ ∑_j |W_{ij}| < |h_i|.

Examples
- Acyclic signed digraph (new): 1→2 (W_{12} = −3), 1→3 (2), 2→3 (1), h = (0,1,−2). Topological order 1,2,3. Pick x_3 = sign(−2) = −1; then x_2 ∈ argmax a·(1·x_3 + 1) = a·0 ⇒ pick a = 1; then x_1 ∈ argmax a·(−3·x_2 + 2·x_3) = a·(−3·1 + 2·(−1)) = a·(−5) ⇒ x_1 = −1. The resulting profile (−1,1,−1) is a PNE.
- Mixed SCCs (new): Let C^1 be undirected on {1,2,3} (arbitrary signed weights, symmetric), C^2 structurally balanced on {4,5}. Suppose edges only from C^1 to C^2. Solve C^2 first for its own h; then induce f on C^1 and solve its exact potential subgame. The union is a PNE.
- Necessity of “good” SCCs: A single SCC that is a directed 3-cycle with all three arcs negative (Example 2(b) in the paper) is neither undirected nor structurally balanced and has no PNE; Theorem 2 does not apply, illustrating tightness of the condition at the SCC level.

Obstacles and limitations
- The SCC-wise condition is sufficient, not necessary: there are SCCs that are neither undirected nor structurally balanced yet still admit PNE for all external fields (characterizing these seems hard).
- Replacing “structurally balanced” by weaker notions (e.g., few sign inconsistencies) may still suffice, but additional technical work is needed (e.g., perturbative arguments or mixed supermodularity within blocks).

Next steps
- Characterize “NE-guaranteed” SCCs beyond undirected/structurally balanced by intrinsic signed cycle conditions (e.g., forbidding matching-pennies minors), or via robust potential-like properties.
- Explore algorithmic tests: given W_{UU}, decide whether the restricted subgame is NE-guaranteed for all external fields f. Candidate approaches: cycle-space sign conditions or monotone systems after blockwise gauge transformations.
- Combine with cohesiveness: integrate the paper’s cohesive-core results with the SCC decomposition to handle cases where only a subset in an SCC is good but exerts dominating influence.

Summary of new checkable claims
- Proposition 1: Any SNC game on a DAG has a PNE (constructive backward induction).
- Theorem 2: If every SCC is undirected or structurally balanced (hence NE-guaranteed), the overall SNC game has a PNE (constructive via condensation DAG).
- Weight-dominance condition: If |h_i| > ∑_j |W_{ij}| ∀i, then x^* = sign(h) is a strict PNE.
These add graph classes and a modular construction principle to the existing toolkit in the provided paper.

\section{Introduction}
A key feature of many socio-technical systems is the heterogeneity among the behaviors of the agents in the network and among their interactions and mutual influences. Such heterogeneities pose significant challenges in various fields including traffic and routing games,  epidemics models.

In this paper, we focus on heterogeneous interactions within networks of agents engaged in strategic games with binary actions. Our model encompasses two prominent families of network games \cite{Blume:1993,Jackson:2008,Galeotti.ea:2010,Jackson.Zenou:2015}: network coordination games \cite{Ellison:1993,Young:1993,Morris:2000,Young:2006,Jackson.Storms:2025} and network anti-coordination games \cite{Bramoulle.ea:2004,Galam:2004,Bramoulle:2007,Lopez-Pintado:2009,Grabisch.Li:2019},  both of which have a variety of applications in economics, social sciences, and biology. In their simplest version, the utility of a player in a network coordination (anti-coordination) game is an affine increasing (decreasing) function of the number of her neighbors in the network playing the same action. Despite their apparent similarity, both fundamental properties and applications of network coordination and network anti-coordination games are quite different. 	

Network coordination games model the so called strategic complements effects, that is when the choice of a certain action by one player makes it more appealing for other players to play the same action. They are used to model social network features like the adoption of beliefs or behavioral attitudes, or economic ones such as the spread of a new technology. Mathematically, they belong to the broader class of super-modular games \cite{Topkins:1979,Milgrom.ea:1990,Vives:1990,Topkins:1998}. As a consequence, Nash equilibria always exist and one special instance of them are the consensus strategy profiles, namely, those where all individuals are playing the same action. Moreover, asynchronous best response dynamics globally reach the set of Nash equilibria in network coordination games. \cite{Ramazi.Cao:2020}  

In contrast, network anti-coordination games are representative of another class of games exhibiting the so called strategic substitutes effect. In this case, the choice of a certain action by one player makes it more appealing for the other players to play the opposite action. They provide a natural model in situations where players are competing for resources that can become congested or in models where players can provide a public good, buy snob goods, or, in general, when there are gains from differentiation. In contrast to network coordination games, existence of Nash equilibria for anti-coordination games is guaranteed  in special cases  strongly dependent on the network structure. \cite{Bramoulle:2007} Moreover, even when equilibria exist, asynchronous best response dynamics may have limit cycles. 

Network games comprising both coordinating and anti-coordinating interactions have been recently proposed to model the presence of anti-conformist behaviors in a social community, accounting for some form of heterogeneity \cite{Ramazi.Riehl.Cao:2016,Grabisch.ea:2019,ramazi2023characterizing, le2023heterogeneous, liang2025coevolution} . More generally, games exhibiting both strategic complements and substitutes have been recently proposed in the economic literature  \cite{Monaco:2016} to model heterogeneous interactions, e.g., markets with coexistence of both Cournot and Bertrand type firms. Such mixed games may fail to possess Nash equilibria. A fundamental example is the matching pennies game, which is a two-player game with one coordinating and one anti-coordinating player. %\tcr{DA QUI, VA CAMBIATA UN PO'} 
In contrast with the matching pennies game, one can imagine that in a scenario where most of the players are coordinating and form a 'well' connected subset, the presence of few anti-coordinating players should not prevent the coordinating players to reach a consensus and possibly the whole system to reach a Nash equilibrium. This is one main motivation to our work. 

Another application is when a subset of the graph is structurally balanced \cite{Harary:1953,Cartwright:1956}. A structurally balanced signed graph is one where vertices can be split into two subsets so that intra links on every set have positive weight, while links connecting the two groups have negative weight. Such property envisages a polarization in the system's equilibrium. 
 In this case we want to determine whether such polarization is still reached even if the entire graph is not structurally balanced. 
 
{\color{black} Network models with signed weights have appeared in many other different fields: to model the presence of antagonistic interactions in social networks \cite{Harary:1953,Cartwright:1956, Macy:2003, Leskovec:2010}, inhibitory signals in genetics \cite{Kauffman:1969, Thomas:1973} and neural networks \cite{Hopfield:2010}, antiferromagnetic bonds in spin glasses \cite{Mezard}.
The popular Linear Threshold Model (LTM) originally introduced in \cite{Granovetter:1978} for non negative graphs has been recently proposed in the context of signed graphs in \cite{He:2013, Golesa:2025}. This dynamical system is strictly related to the best response dynamics for network ccordination games. Literature on LTM on signed graphs has focused on showing the differences with respect to the nonnegative case: lack of cascades, dependence on the activation pattern, polarization. Somewhat analogous are the studies of the linear averaging dynamics on signed graphs \cite{Altafini:2012, Altafini:2013}. Therein, the important concept of structurally balanced graph %, originally introduced in social science in \cite{Harary:1953,Cartwright:1956},  
is used to determine the structure of the steady state dynamics. %A structurally balanced signed graph is one where vertices can be split into two subsets so that intra links on every set have positive weight, while links connecting the two groups have negative weight. Such property envisages a polarization in the system's equilibrium.  %\tcr{When the graph is not structurally balanced, one can look for the biggest Robust structural balance \cite{wang2020robust}. 
}

In this paper, we consider a finite set of agents whose network of interactions is modelled as a directed signed graph. Given two agents, it is possible that a link exists in just one direction and, even when both links  are present, they may have a different weight and possibly weights with opposite signs. This means that agent $i$ may tend to coordinate with an agent $j$, while agent $j$ tends to anti-coordinate with $i$. The utility of agent $i$ is an aggregation of a family of pairwise terms one for each of the out-neighbors of $i$ plus an individual bias term. Each pairwise term can be of coordination or anti-coordination type and is modulated by the corresponding graph weight.  We call such games signed network coordination games.
The focus of this paper is on the existence of pure strategy Nash equilibria in signed-network coordination (SNC) games and the analysis of their stability with respect to best response transitions. 

Our work builds on two fundamental concepts. The first one is a novel use of the notion of cohesiveness originally proposed in the pioneering work \cite{Morris:2000} to describe the pure Nash equilibria of network coordination games. The second is the super-modularity property \cite{Topkins:1979,Milgrom.ea:1990,Vives:1990,Topkins:1998} of network coordination games, particularly the robustness results recently appeared in \cite{arditti2024robust}. 
The general setup of our results is that of a SNC game where the set of agents $\mc V$ is split into two subsets $\mc V=\mc R\cup\mc S$. Agents in $\mc R$ are assumed to be intra themselves coordinating and form a sufficiently 'cohesive' subset. Alternatively, they are assumed to form a 'cohesive' structurally balanced subset. In this latter case, a transformation of the strategy profile set allows to obtain a coordinating subset. If agents in $\mc S$ possess an equilibrium conditioned to any possible value of the actions taken by the agents in $\mc R$, then a Nash equilibrium exists that is a consensus or a polarization (respectively) on the agents in $\mc R$. This is the content of our first result, Theorem \ref{theo:main-existence}. 

Conditions for the convergence of the best response dynamics are characterized in terms of a novel notion of indecomposability, related to the uniform non-cohesiveness property used in \cite{Morris:2000}, and make a fundamental use of robust properties of super-modular games \cite{arditti2024robust}. Our main result, Theorem \ref{theo:main-stability}, formalizes these ideas. 

Weaker preliminary results have appeared in \cite{vanelli2020games} and \cite{arditti2021equilibria}. In \cite{vanelli2020games}, the underlying graph of interactions was a complete one. In \cite{arditti2021equilibria}, each agent was engaged in interactions of only one type, either coordinating or anti-coordinating. Moreover, the graph restricted to each of the two subgroups was assumed to be undirected.

We conclude this section by presenting a brief outline of this paper. The remainder of this section is devoted to the introduction of some basic notational conventions to be followed throughout the paper.  In Section \ref{sec:network-coordination-games}, we formally introduce SNC game %, we recall a number of basic facts on super-modular and potential games,
 and we present few examples illustrating the problem we want to consider. In Section \ref{sec:prel}, we derive some preliminary results for three classes of signed graphs: undirected, unsigned and structurally balanced. In Section \ref{sec:results}, we present our main results, in particular Theorems \ref{theo:main-existence} and \ref{theo:main-stability}, and show their applicability. %In Section \ref{sec:SB}, we discuss the applicability of our results to graphs that contain a cohesive structurally BR-stable subset. 
Finally, Section \ref{conclusion} presents some final remarks.

For a vector $x$ in $\R^{\mc V}$ and a subset $\mc A\subseteq\mc V$, we use the notation $x_{\mc A}$ in $\R^{\mc A}$ for the restricted vector with entries $(x_{\mc A})_i=x_i$ for every $i$ in $\mc A$. The all-$1$ vector, whose size may be deduced from the context, will be denoted by $\1$. For a vector $x$ in $\R^{\mc V}$ and some $i$ in $\mc V$, we write $x_{-i}=x_{\mc V\setminus\{i\}}$ for the vector in $\R^{\mc V\setminus\{i\}}$ obtained from $i$ by removing its $i$-th entry. 

Similarly, for two finite sets $\mc U$ and $\mc V$, $\R^{\mc{U}\times\mc V}$  denotes the space of real matrices $M$ whose entries $M_{ij}$ are indexed by the pairs $(i,j)$ in $\mc{U}\times\mc V$. For a matrix $M$ in $\R^{\mc{U}\times\mc V}$ and two subsets $\mc A\subseteq\mc U$ and $\mc B\subseteq\mc V$, we use the notation $M_{\mc A\mc B}$ in $\R^{\mc A\times\mc B}$ for the restricted matrix, with entries $(M_{\mc A\mc B})_{ij}$ for every $i$ in $\mc A$ and $j$ in $\mc B$.  
For a vector $d$ in $\R^{\mc A}$, $[d]$ stands for the diagonal matrix with diagonal coinciding with $d$, i.e.,  $[d]\in\R^{\mc A\times\mc A}$ is such that $[d]_{ii}=d_i$ and $[d]_{ij}=0$ for every $i$ in $\mc A$ and $j$ in $\mc A\setminus\{j\}$. 


\section{Model}
\label{sec:network-coordination-games}


In this section, we introduce the model in its general form and present the main issues addressed in the rest of the paper.
\subsection{Signed Network Coordination Games}
We model networks as finite directed weighted signed graphs $\mc G=(\mc V, \mc E, W)$, with non-empty set of nodes $\mc V$, set of directed links $\mc E\subseteq\mc V\times\mc V$, and weight matrix $W$ in $\R^{\mc V\times\mc V}$ such that $W_{ij} \neq 0$ if and only if $(i,j)$ is a link in $\mc E$. 
We do not allow for the presence of self-loops, equivalently, we assume that the weight matrix $W$ has zero diagonal. Throughout, finite directed weighted signed graphs without self-loops will be simply referred to as \emph{networks}.\footnote{Notice that we do not assume in general that $W_{ij}$ and $W_{ji}$ have the same sign (a property referred to as ``digon sign-symmetry'' in \cite{Altafini:2013}.)}

We shall call a network $\mc G=(\mc V, \mc E, W)$ \emph{undirected} when the weight matrix $W=W'$ is symmetric, so that in particular $(j,i)$ is a link in $\mc E$ whenever $(i,j)$ is, and in this case they have the same weight $W_{ij}=W_{ji}$. We refer to a network $\mc G=(\mc V, \mc E, W)$ as \emph{unsigned} when the weight matrix $W$ is non-negative, i.e., all links $(i,j)$ in $\mc E$ have positive weight $W_{ij}>0$. For a network $\mc G=(\mc V, \mc E, W)$ and a subset of nodes $\mc U\subseteq\mc V$, we consider the subnetwork $\mc G_{\mc U}=(\mc U,\mc E_{\mc U},W_{\mc U\mc U})$ where $\mc E_{\mc U}=\mc E\cap(\mc U\times\mc U)$ is the subset of links with both tail node and head node in $\mc U$, while $W_{\mc U\mc U}$ is the sub-matrix of $W$ obtained by restricting its row and column sets to $\mc U$.




\begin{example}\label{ex1}
Figure \ref{fig:graph1} illustrates a network with weight values reported next to the corresponding links. Notice that, for $\mc R=\{1,2,\dots, 8\}$ the subnetwork $\mc G_{\mc R}$ is unsigned, whereas for  $\mc S=\mc V\setminus \mc R=\{9,10,\dots, 13\}$ % and $\tilde{\mc S}=\mc V\setminus \tilde{\mc R}=\{7, 8,\dots, 13\}$ 
the subnetwork $\mc G_{\mc S}$ is undirected.

\begin{definition}\label{def:coordination}
	The \emph{signed network coordination (SNC) game} with \emph{binary actions}  on a network $\mc G=(\mc V,\mc E,W)$ with  external field $h$ in $\R^{\mc V}$ is the strategic game with player set $\mc V$, whereby every player $i$ in $\mc V$ has action set $\mc A=\{\pm1\}$ and utility function $u_i: \mc X\rightarrow \R$ given by
	\be\label{eq:ut} u_i(x)=u_i(x_i,x_{-i})=h_ix_i+ x_i\sum_{j\in\mc V}W_{ij}x_j\,,\ee 
	for every strategy profile $x$, where $\mc X=\mc A^\mc V$ denotes the set of strategy profiles of all players and $x_{-i}$ in $\mc X_{-i}=\mc A^{\mc V\setminus\{i\}}$ stands for the strategy profile of all players except for player $i$.
\end{definition}
We now provide an interpretation of the SNC games introduced above. The utility function \eqref{eq:ut} is the sum of two terms. 
The first addend in the right-hand side of  \eqref{eq:ut} is a standalone term $h_ix_i $ (i.e., a term that depends only on the action of player $i$) that models the bias of player $i$ towards one of the two possible actions depending on the sign of the preference term $h_i$: if $h_i>0$ (respectively, $h_i<0$), then player $i$ has a bias towards action $+1$ ($-1$), in that, in the absence of the network (i.e., if $W=0$) this action would provide a utility that is $2h_i$ larger than its alternative $-1$ ($+1$); if $h_i=0$, then no bias is present in that both actions $+1$ and $-1$ would reward player $i$ with the same utility in the absence of the network.
The second addend in the right-hand side of  \eqref{eq:ut} is the aggregate of pairwise interaction terms $x_iW_{ij}x_j$, each of which can be interpreted as the utility of player $i$ in a two-player game with player $j$. Notice that, while the sum index $j$ in the right-hand side of \eqref{eq:ut} formally runs over all players $j$ in $\mc V$, the sum is effectively only over players $j$ such that $W_{ij}\ne0$, i.e., out-neighbors of player $i$ in the network $\mc G$. Observe that a SNC game with binary actions is an instance of a polymatrix or pairwise-separable game \cite{Yanovskaya:1968,Arditti.Como.Fagnani:2024}.

We say that a player $i$ in $\mc V$ has a \textit{coordinating} interaction with another player $j$ when $W_{ij}>0$, meaning that the utility $u_i(x)$ of player $i$ increases when player $j$ plays the same action as $i$, i..e, when $x_ix_j=1$. Conversely, when $W_{ij}<0$, player $i$ is said to have an \textit{anti-coordinating} interaction with player $j$ in $\mc V$, namely its utility decreases when player $j$ is playing the same action. 
In the special case when the network $\mc G=(\mc V,\mc E,W)$ is unsigned, namely when $W_{ij}\geq 0$ for every $i$ and $j$ in $\mc V$, the SNC game with binary actions is known as a \textit{network coordination game}. On the other hand, when $W_{ij}\leq 0$ for every $i$ and $j$ in $\mc V$, the SNC game is known as a \textit{network anti-coordination game}. 


Observe that our general model of SNC game accounts for asymmetric behaviors: while it is possible that two nodes $i$ and $j$ have the same type of interaction one against the other one, it can happen that a player $i$ has a coordinating interaction with another player $j$ (i.e., $W_{ij}>0$) while $j$ has an anti-coordinating interaction with $i$ or is not influenced by player $i$ at all (i.e., $W_{ji}=0$). This makes the analysis of such games particularly challenging.  
Notice that our framework encompasses and generalizes the special  cases studied in our previous works \cite{vanelli2020games} and \cite{arditti2021equilibria}  where, for every player $i$ in $\mc V$, either $W_{ij}\geq 0$ for every $j$ in $\mc V$, or $W_{ij}\leq 0$ for every $j$ in $\mc V$. 



\subsection{Best Responses and Nash Equilibria}


The \textit{best response} (BR) correspondence for a player $i$ in $\mc V$ is the set of its optimal actions given the strategy profile of the other players. 
Formally,
$$\B_i(x_{-i})= \argmax_{x_i \in\mc A}u_i(x_i,x_{-i}) \,.$$
A (pure strategy) \emph{Nash equilibrium} is a strategy profile $x^*$ in $\mc X$ such that 
$$x^*_i\in\B_i(x^*_{-i})\,,\qquad\forall i\in\mc V\,.$$
The set of Nash equilibria of a game will be denoted as $\mc N$. 
A Nash equilibrium $x^*$ in $\mc N$ is called \emph{strict} if $\mc B_i(x^*_{-i}) =\{x^*_i\}$ for every $i$ in $\mc V$. The set of strict Nash equilibria of a game will be denoted as $\mc N^*$. 

The purpose of this work is to investigate the existence of Nash equilibria for SNC games and study their stability properties under best response transformations. Formally, consider two strategy profiles $x$ and $y$ in $\mc X$. For $l\ge0$, a length-$l$ \emph{best response path} (\emph{BR-path}) from $x$ to $y$ is an $(l+1)$-tuple of strategy profiles in $\mc X^{l+1}$, denoted with 
$(x^{(0)},x^{(1)},\ldots x^{(l)})$,  such that 
\begin{itemize}
	\item $x^{(0)}=x$, and $x^{(l)}=y$; 
	\item for every $k=1,2,\ldots, l$, there exists a player $i_k$ in $\mc V$ such that  
	\be\label{eq:BRpath} x^{(k)}_{-i_k}=x^{(k-1)}_{-i_k}\,, \qquad 	x_{i_k}^{(k)}\in\B_{i_k}(x_{-i_k}^{(k-1)})\setminus\{x^{(k-1)}_{i_k}\}\,.\ee 
\end{itemize}
A BR-path is thus a sequence of unilateral modifications of the strategy profile where one agent at a time changes its action to any of its best responses to the current strategy profile of the rest of the population. Notice that, with the above definition, for every strategy profile $x$ in $\mc X$,   there always exists a length-$0$ BR-path $(x)$ from $x$ to itself. 

We shall refer to a subset of strategy profiles $\mc X^*\subseteq\mc X$ as:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{BR-reachable} from strategy $x$ in $\mc X$ if there exists a BR-path from $x$ to some strategy profile $y$ in $\mc X^*$;  
	\item \emph{globally} BR-reachable if it is BR-reachable from every strategy profile $x$ in $\mc X$;
	\item \emph{BR-invariant} if there are no BR-paths from any $y$ in $\mc X^*$ to any $z$ in $ \mc X\setminus\mc X^*$;
	\item \emph{globally BR-stable} if it is globally BR-reachable and BR-invariant.
\end{itemize}

Notice that a BR-reachable (hence, in particular a globally BR-reachable or globally BR-stable) set of strategy profiles $\mc X^*$ is necessarily non-empty. 
Observe that a singleton $\{x^*\}$ is BR-invariant if and only if $x^*$ is a strict Nash equilibrium. 
A globally BR-stable set is one from which it is impossible to exit through unilateral best response modifications and that can be reached from every initial strategy profile through a finite number  of such modifications. 


\begin{remark} The notions of BR-reachability, BR-invariance, and global BR-stability are particularly relevant for the study of the so-called asynchronous best response dynamics \cite{Blume:1995}.  
These are a class of asynchronous dynamics modeled as discrete-time Markov chains with finite state space coinciding with the strategy profile set $\mc X$, whereby, at every time step $t=0,1,2,\ldots$, conditioned on the current configuration $X(t)=x$, one player $i$ is randomly selected from  the player set $\mc V$ according to a distribution that assigns positive probability to all players, and she updates her action to a value $X_i(t + 1)$ chosen uniformly from her best response set $\mc B_i(x_{-i})$. In fact, observe that, on the one hand, a subset of strategy profiles  $\mc X^*\subseteq\mc X$ is  BR-invariant if and only if it is a trapping set for the asynchronous best response dynamics, i.e., if $X(s)\in\mc X^*$ for some $s\ge0$ implies that $X(t)\in\mc X^*$ for every $t\ge s$.  On the other hand, $\mc X^*$ is globally BR-stable if and only if, for every probability distribution of the initial state $X(0)$ of the asynchronous best response dynamics, there exists a random time $T$ that is finite with probability $1$ and is such that $X(t)\in\mc X^*$ for every $t\ge T$. \end{remark}

\begin{remark}\label{remark:I-reachable}
 In \cite{arditti2024robust}, the notion of improvement path (I-path) was introduced along with the related notions of I-reachability, I-invariance, and I-stability. Specifically, a length-$l$  I-path is a $(l+1)$-tuple of strategy profiles  $(x^{(0)},x^{(1)},\ldots x^{(l)})$ such that for every $k=1,2,\ldots, l$ there exists a player $i_k$ in $\mc V$ such that  
\be\label{eq:Ipath} x^{(k)}_{-i_k}=x^{(k-1)}_{-i_k}\,, \qquad 	u_{i_k}(x^{(k)})>u_{i_k}(x^{(k-1)}) \,.\ee 
Notice that, if the action space of every player is binary, as is our case, then condition \eqref{eq:Ipath} implies condition \eqref{eq:BRpath}, so that every I-path is also a BR-path, but not necessarily vice versa. As a consequence, every (globally) I-reachable set of strategy profiles is (globally) BR-reachable. Conversely, every BR-invariant  set of strategy profiles is I-invariant, but not vice versa: e.g., every non-strict Nash equilibrium is I-invariant but not BR-invariant. On the other hand, neither global I-stability implies global BR-stability nor vice versa: e.g., for the SNC game of Example \ref{ex:onelink} with $\alpha=0$, the set of Nash equilibria $\mc N$ is globally I-stable but not globally BR-stable. 
\end{remark}


The following two examples show how Nash equilibria may not exist for SNC games.

	\caption{Two signed graphs representing: (a) the discoordination game and (b) a directed anti-coordination game.}
	\label{fig:disc_game}
\end{figure}


\begin{example}\label{ex:discoord}
The SNC game on the network (a) in Figure \ref{fig:disc_game} with external field $h=0$ reduces to a two-player game with binary action set $\mc A=\{\pm1\}$ and utilities $u_1(x_1, x_2) = x_1x_2$ and $u_2(x_1, x_2) =-x_1x_2$.  This is commonly referred to as the discoordination game \cite{jackson2015games} and known not to possess Nash equilibria. 
\end{example} 
\begin{example}\label{ex:3ringanticoord}
The SNC game with binary actions on the network (b) in Figure \ref{fig:disc_game} with external field $h=0$ is an anti-coordination game. For $x^*$ to be a Nash equilibrium, one should have $x_1^*=-x_2^*=x_3^*=-x_1^*$, which is impossible in $\{\pm1\}^3$. Hence, this game does not admit any Nash equilibria.
\end{example} 

 
Even for SNC games that do admit Nash equilibria, these may fail to be  globally BR-reachable or BR-invariant, as illustrated in the following two examples. 

\begin{example}\label{ex:onelink} Consider a SNC game on a network $\mc G=(\mc V,\mc E,W)$ with two nodes  $\mc V=\{1,2\}$, a single link $\mc E=\{(1,2)\}$, and weight matrix $W=(1,0)'(0,1)\,,$ 
and  external field $h=(0,\alpha)$, where $\alpha$ is a scalar parameter. Then, the set of Nash equilibria is 
$$\mc N=\left\{\ba{lcl}
\{-\1\}&\se&\alpha<0\,,\\
\{\pm\1\}&\se&\alpha=0\,,\\
\{\1\}&\se& \alpha>0\,.
\ea\right.$$
It is easily verifiable that $\mc N$ is globally BR-reachable for every $\alpha$. 
In fact, for $\alpha\ne0$ then the unique Nash equilibrium is strict, so that $\mc N$ is BR-invariant, hence globally BR-stable. On the other hand, for $\alpha=0$, there are two Nash equilibria neither of which is strict: in this case, neither $\mc N$ nor any of it subsets are BR-reachable, and there are no globally BR-stable sets. 
\end{example}

Consider the signed-network related to the graph in Figure \ref{fig:noeq_nostability} with $h=0$. Observe that the set $\mc R= \{1,\dots, 7\}$ is a coordinating set. A direct check shows that the set of Nash equilibria is $\mc N=\{\pm x^*\}$, where $x^*$ is the strategy profile with $x^*_{\mc R} =\1$  and $x^*_8 = -1$. However, $\mc N$ is not globally BR-reachable, as the subset of strategy profiles $$\mc X_{\mc R}=\{y\in\mc X:\,y_1=y_2=y_3=-y_5=-y_6=-y_7\}\,,$$ is BR-invariant.

\section{Preliminary results}\label{sec:prel}

In this subsection, we shall first present some preliminary results on two special classes of SNC games: SNC games on undirected networks and network coordination games (i.e., SNC games on unsigned networks). We will rely on standard results on super-modular and potential games, respectively, to show that the set of Nash equilibria $\mc N$ of both these classes of games is non-empty and globally BR-reachable, and, for undirected SNC games, that $\mc N$ contains a non-empty globally BR-stable subset. We will then present a number of examples of SNC games outside these two classes that illustrate the specific challenge in the study of the existence and stability of Nash equilibria of general SNC games.

\subsection{SNC games on undirected networks}
A strategic game with strategy profile space $\mc X$  is called \emph{exact potential} if there exists a \emph{potential function} $\Phi:\mc X\to\R$ 
such that,  for every player $i$ in $\mc V$ and strategy profiles $x$ and $y$ in $\mc X$,  
\begin{equation}\label{potential_function}
x_{-i}=y_{-i}\quad\Longrightarrow\quad u_i(y)-u_i(x) =\Phi(y)-\Phi(x)\,,
 \end{equation}
It is well known \cite{Monderer.Shapley:1996} that the set of Nash equilibria $\mc N$ of every finite exact potential game  is always nonempty: in particular, every global maximum point $x^*$  of the potential function $\Phi(x)$ is a Nash equilibrium.  The following result states that a SNC game on a network $\mc G$ is an exact potential game if and only if $\mc G$ is undirected and that, in this case, its set of Nash equilibria contains  a nonempty globally BR-stable subset. 




 \begin{proposition}\label{pr:pot_mixed}
Consider a SNC game with binary actions on a network $\mc G=(\mc V,\mc E,W)$ with  external field $h$.
Then, 
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item[(i)] the game is exact potential if and only if $\mc G$ is undirected.  \end{enumerate}
Moreover, if $\mc G$ is undirected, then:  
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item[(ii)]  $\Phi:\mc X\to\R$ is an exact potential function for the SNC game if and only if there exists a constant $C$ in $\R$ such that 
\be\label{potential_function_het}
\Phi(x)=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j\in \mc V}W_{ij}x_i x_j + \sum_{i\in \mc V} h_i x_i+C\,,  
\ee
for every strategy profile $x$ in $\mc X$;
 \item[(iii)]   there exists a globally BR-stable set $\ov{\mc N}$ such that 
 $$\argmax_{x\in\mc X}\Phi(x)\subseteq\ov{\mc N}\subseteq\mc N\,.$$
 \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition} 
\begin{proof}
(i) Consider two strategy profiles $x$ and $y$ in $\mc X$ such that $x_{-i}=y_{-i}$ and $y_i=1=-x_i$ for some player $i$ in $\mc V$. Then, from \eqref{eq:ut} we have  that 
\be\label{uiy-x} u_i(y)-u_i(x) =2\sum_{k\in\mc V}W_{ik}x_k+2h_i\,.\ee

If $\mc G$ is undirected, then \eqref{potential_function_het} and \eqref{uiy-x} imply that 
\be\label{phiy-x} 
\ba{rcl}\Phi(y)-\Phi(x)&=&\ds\sum_{k\in\mc V}W_{ik}x_k+\sum_{k\in\mc V}W_{ki}x_k+2h_i\\[15pt]
&=&\ds2\sum_{k\in\mc V}W_{ik}x_k+2h_i\\[15pt]
&=&u_i(y)-u_i(x)\,,\ea\ee
thus proving that the SNC game with binary actions on $\mc G$ with  external field $h$ is an exact potential game. 

On the other hand, if $\mc G$ is not undirected, let $i\ne j$ in $\mc V$ be such that \be\label{Wij<Wji}W_{ij}< W_{ji}\,,\ee 
and consider a configuration $x$ such that $x_i=x_j=-1$.  Let $y$, $w$, and $z$ in $\mc X$ be the configuration such that, respectively: $y_i=1$ and $y_{-i}=x_{-i}$;  $w_j=1$ and $w_{-j}=x_{-j}$; $z_{-j}=y_{-j}$ and $z_j=1$. Observe that 
\be\label{uiz-w} \ba{rcl}u_i(z)-u_i(w) &\!\!\!=\!\!\!&\ds2\sum_{k\in\mc V}W_{ik}w_k+2h_i\\[15pt]
&\!\!\!=\!\!\!&\ds2\sum_{k\in\mc V}W_{ik}x_k+2h_i+2\sum_{k\in\mc V}W_{ik}(w_k-x_k)\\[15pt]
&\!\!\!=\!\!\!&u_i(y)-u_i(x)+4W_{ij}\,,\ea\ee
where the last identity follows from the fact that $w_{-j}=x_{-j}$ and $w_j=1=-x_j$. 
Similarly, we have that 
\be\label{ujz-y} \ba{rcl}u_j(z)-u_j(y) &\!\!\!=\!\!\!&2\ds\sum_{k\in\mc V}W_{jk}y_k+2h_j\\[15pt]
&\!\!\!=\!\!\!&2\ds\sum_{k\in\mc V}W_{jk}x_k+2h_j+2\sum_{k\in\mc V}W_{jk}(y_k-x_k)\\[15pt]
&\!\!\!=\!\!\!&u_j(w)-u_j(x)+4W_{ji}\,,\ea\ee
where the last identity follows from the fact that $y_{-i}=x_{-i}$ and $y_i=1=-x_i$. 
It the follows from \eqref{Wij<Wji}, \eqref{uiz-w}, and \eqref{ujz-y} that
\be\label{no-potential}
\ba{rcl}0
&<&4(W_{ji}-W_{ij})\\[5pt]
&=&u_i(y)-u_i(x)+u_j(x)-u_j(w)\\[5pt]
&&+u_i(w)-u_i(z)+u_j(z)-u_j(y)\,.
\ea
\ee
It then follows from \cite[Corollary 2.9]{Monderer.Shapley:1996}  that the SNC game with binary actions on $\mc G$ with external field $h$ is not an exact potential game.
%Observe that \eqref{no-potential} implies that the SNC game with binary actions on $\mc G$ with external field $h$ is not an exact potential game, as if it were, then \eqref{no-potential} and \eqref{potential_function} would imply that 
%$$\ba{rcl}0
%&<&u_i(y)-u_i(x)+u_j(x)-u_j(w)\\[5pt]
%&&+u_i(w)-u_i(z)+u_j(z)-u_j(y)\\[5pt]
%&=&\Phi(y)-\Phi(x)+\Phi(x)-\Phi(w)\\[5pt]
%&&+\Phi(w)-\Phi(z)+\Phi(z)-\Phi(y)\\[5pt]
%&=&0
%\,,\ea$$
% which is a contradiction.

(ii) If $\mc G$ is undirected, then \eqref{phiy-x} implies that $\Phi$ defined in \eqref{potential_function_het} is an exact potential function for  the SNC game with binary actions on $\mc G$ with  external field $h$. The claim then follows from  \cite[Lemma 2.7]{Monderer.Shapley:1996}.

(iii) The claim is a direct consequence of \cite[Lemma 2]{Catalano.ea:2024}.

\subsection{SNC games on unsigned networks}
%We first focus that network coordination games. % are  an instance of super-modular games.  
A finite strategic game where all players have binary action set $\mc A=\{\pm1\}$ is \emph{super-modular}\cite{Topkins:1979,Milgrom.ea:1990,Vives:1990,Topkins:1998} if it satisfies the \emph{increasing difference property}, i.e., if 
\be\label{IDP}u_i(+1,x_{-i})-u_i(-1,x_{-i})\le u_i(+1,y_{-i})-u_i(+1,y_{-i})\,,\ee
for every two strategy profiles $x$ and $y$ in $\mc X$ such that $x\le y$. 
For super-modular games, Nash equilibria are guaranteed to exist and they form a lattice in the strategy profile space.
The following result states that a SNC game is super-modular if and only if it is a network coordination game and that, in this case, the set of its Nash equilibria is non-empty and globally BR-reachable. 

\begin{proposition}  \label{prop:super-modular}
Consider a SNC game with binary actions on a network $\mc G=(\mc V,\mc E,W)$ with  external field $h$.
Then, 
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item[(i)] the game is super-modular if and only if $\mc G$ is unsigned;  
 \item[(ii)] if $\mc G$ is unsigned, then the set of Nash equilibria $\mc N$ is globally BR-reachable.
 \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{IEEEproof} (i) For every strategy profile $x$ in $\mc X$ and player $i$ in $\mc V$, let 
$$\delta_i(x)=u_i(+1,x_{-i})-u_i(-1,x_{-i})=2h_i+2\sum_{j\in\mc V}W_{ij}x_j\,.$$
Then, for every two strategy profiles  $x$ and $y$ in $\mc X$, we have
\be\label{dy-dx}\delta_i(y)-\delta_i(x)=\sum_{j\in\mc V}W_{ij}(y_j-x_j)\,,\ee
for every $i$ in $\mc V$. 
If $W_{ij}\ge0$ for every $i$ and $j$ in $\mc V$, then \eqref{dy-dx} implies that 
$$\delta_i(y)-\delta_i(x)=\sum_{j\in\mc V}W_{ij}(y_j-x_j)\ge0\,,$$ 
whenever $x\le y$, so that the increasing difference property \eqref{IDP} holds true, hence SNC game is super-modular.  

Conversely, if $W_{ij}<0$ for some $i$ and $j$ in $\mc V$, then let $x$ and $y$  in $\mc X$ be two strategy profiles such that $x_j=-1$, $y_j=+1$, and $x_{-j}=y_{-j}$, so that $x\le y$. Then,  \eqref{dy-dx} implies that
$$\delta_i(y)-\delta_i(x)=2W_{ij}<0\,,$$ so that the increasing difference property \eqref{IDP} does not hold true, hence the SNC game is not super-modular.  

(ii) This is a direct consequence of \cite[Proposition 3(v)]{arditti2024robust}, which asserts that the set of Nash equilibria is globally I-stable (i.e., globally I-reachable and I-invariant) and the fact that I-reachability implies BR-reachability (c.f.~Remark \ref{remark:I-reachable}).
\end{IEEEproof}\medskip

\begin{remark} Proposition \ref{prop:super-modular} ensures that every network coordination game, i.e., every SNC game with binary actions on an unsigned network $\mc G$, admits Nash equilibria and that the set $\mc N$ of Nash equilibria is globally BR-reachable. Notice that, $\mc N$ may not be BR-invariant, as Example \ref{ex:onelink} illustrates. 
\end{remark}

\subsection{Signed network games on structurally balanced networks}
The results in the previous subsection can be extended by introducing the notion of structural balance \cite{Harary:1953,Cartwright:1956}. 
This is a property of signed networks that corresponds to the possibility of exactly partitioning the signed graph into two adversary sub-communities, such that all links within each sub-community have positive weight, whereas all links between nodes of different communities have negative weights.  
When the graph is structurally balanced, the SNC game can be transformed through a change of variables into a network coordination game. Consensus strategy profiles in the network coordination game corresponds to strategy profiles that take opposite sign in the two communities of the structurally balanced graph. 

%In the following, we exploit the existence of structurally balanced subnetworks to obtain results on existence, reachability and stability of strategy profiles that are polarized in the structurally balanced component. %and generalize previous results considering strategy profiles that are consensus on the coordinating side, we obtain strategy profiles that polarized in the structurally balanced subnetwork.
First, to every $\sigma$ in $\mc X=\{\pm1\}^{\mc V}$, we can associate a diagonal matrix $[\sigma]$ in $\R^{\mc V\times\mc V}$ with diagonal entries $$[\sigma]_{ii}=\sigma_i\,,\qquad \forall i\in\mc V\,.$$ 
Such matrices identify linear operators in $\R^n$ that are referred to as \textit{gauge transformations} in some of the literature \cite{Altafini:2013}. 

\begin{definition}
For a network $\mc G=(\mc V,\mc E,W)$, and a vector $h$ in $\R^{\mc V}$, consider the SNC game with binary actions on $\mc G$ with  external field $h$. Given $\sigma$ in $\mc X$, let the $[\sigma]$-transformed network be 
\be\label{sigmaG}\mc G^{[\sigma]}=(\mc V,\mc E,W^{[\sigma]})\,,\qquad W^{[\sigma]}=[\sigma]W[\sigma]\,,\ee
and the $[\sigma]$-transformed external field \be\label{sigmad}h^{[\sigma]}=[\sigma]h\,.\ee
Then, the \emph{$[\sigma]$-transformed} game is the SNC game with binary actions on $[\sigma]$-transformed network  $\mc G^{[\sigma]}$  with $[\sigma]$-transformed external field $h^{[\sigma]}$. 
\end{definition}
Observe that the utility function of every player $i$ in $\mc V$ in the $[\sigma]$-transformed game defined above is given by  
\be\label{sigmau}\ba{rcl}\ds u^{[\sigma]}_i(x)
&=&\ds x^TW^{[\sigma]}x+(h^{[\sigma]})^Tx\\[5pt] 
&=&\ds x^T[\sigma]W[\sigma]x+h^T[\sigma]x\\[5pt] 
&=&\ds  u_i([\sigma]x)\,,\ea\ee
	for every strategy profile $x$ in $\mc X$. 
Equation \eqref{sigmau} shows that, if we apply a gauge transformation $[\sigma]$ to a SNC game, we obtain a new SNC game whose utility functions coincide with the ones of the original game evaluated in the transformed strategy profiles $[\sigma]x$.
This immediately leads to the following result. 
\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:NashGauge} Consider a SNC game with binary actions on a network $\mc G=(\mc V,\mc E,W)$ with external field $h$, and let $\mc N$ be the set of its Nash equilibria. Given $\sigma$ in $\mc X$, consider the $[\sigma]$-transformed  game and let 
$\mc B_i^{[\sigma]}$, for every player $i$ in $\mc V$, be its best response  correspondence, and $\mc N_{[\sigma]}$ be the set of its Nash equilibria. Then, 
\be\label{BR=BR}\mc B_i^{[\sigma]}(x_{-i})=\sigma_i\mc B_i(([\sigma]x)_{-i})\,,\ee
for every player $i$ in $\mc V$ and strategy profile $x$ in $\mc X$, and
\be\label{Nash=Nash}\mc N=\{[\sigma]x^*:\,x^*\in\mc N_{[\sigma]}\}\,.\ee
\end{lemma}
\begin{IEEEproof}
See Appendix \ref{sec:proof-lemma-NashGauge}.\end{IEEEproof}\medskip 



 %As a consequence of the transformation in the actions, consensus strategy profiles in $\tilde{\mc G}$ will correspond to polarized ones in $\mc G$. 

 Gauge transformations are particularly useful when the graph is structurally balanced, as per the following definition.
\begin{definition}\label{sb} Consider a network $\mc G=(\mc V,\mc E, W)$. Then: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)] a \emph{balanced partition} of $\mc G$ is a binary partition 
\be\label{balanced-partition} \mc V_1\cup \mc V_2=\mc V\,,\qquad \mc V_1\cap \mc V_2=\emptyset\,,\ee
of its node set $\mc V$ such that 
\be\label{balanced-partition-1} W_{ij}\geq 0\,,\qquad \forall i,j \in \mc V_q\,,\ q=1,2\,,\ee
and
\be\label{balanced-partition-2} W_{ij}\leq 0\,,\qquad \forall i \in \mc V_q\,,\ j\in\mc V_r\,,\ q\ne r\,,\ q,r\in\{1,2\}\,;\ee
\item[(ii)] $\mc G$ is \emph{structurally balanced} if it admits a balanced partition. 
%\item A subset $\mc R\subseteq\mc V$ is called \emph{structurally balanced} if $\mc G_{\mc R}$ is such.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Definition \ref{sb} says that a network is structurally balanced if its node set can be split into two opposite parts such that links connecting nodes in the same part all have nonnegative weight, while links connecting nodes in opposite parts all have nonpositive weight. We have the following simple result. 
\begin{lemma} \label{lemma:balanced}
A network $\mc G=(\mc V,\mc E, W)$ is structurally balanced if and only if there exists a gauge transformation $[\sigma]$ such that the $[\sigma]$-transformed network $\mc G^{[\sigma]}$ is unsigned. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{IEEEproof} This result coincides with \cite[Lemma 1]{Altafini:2013}. However, since the work \cite{Altafini:2013} is developed under the ``digon sign-symmetry'' assumption (c.f.~footnote 1), and we are working in greater generality, we present a proof in Appendix \ref{sec:proof-lemma-balanced}.   
\end{IEEEproof}\medskip

Lemma \ref{lemma:balanced} and Proposition \ref{prop:super-modular} together imply the following result. 

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:structurally-balanced-equilibria}
Consider a SNC game with binary actions on a network $\mc G=(\mc V,\mc E,W)$ with external field $h$. 
If $\mc G$ is structurally balanced, then the set of Nash equilibria $\mc N$ is  globally BR-reachable. 
\end{proposition}
\begin{IEEEproof}
If $\mc G$ is structurally balanced, Lemma \ref{lemma:balanced} implies that there exists a gauge transformation $[\sigma]$ such that the whole node set $\mc V$ is coordinating in the $[\sigma]$-transformed network $\mc G^{[\sigma]}$. It then follows from Proposition \ref{prop:super-modular}(ii) that the $[\sigma]$-transformed SNC game with binary action on the network $\mc G^{[\sigma]}$ with external field $h^{[\sigma]}$  has a non-empty and globally BR-reachable set of Nash equilibria $\mc N_{[\sigma]}$. 
Lemma \ref{lemma:NashGauge} then implies that the set of Nash equilibria of the SNC game with binary actions on $\mc G$ with external field $h$ satisfies  $\mc N=\{[\sigma]x^*:\,x^*\in\mc N_{[\sigma]}\}\ne\emptyset$ and is globally BR-reachable. 
\end{IEEEproof}

\begin{example}\label{ex:sb}
	Consider the graph in Figure \ref{fig:sb}. The graph is not structurally balanced. Anyway, the subset $\mc R=\{1, \dots, 4\}$ is such that the graph $\mc G_{\mc R}$ is structurally balanced. Indeed, the partition $\mc R = \mc R_1 \cup \mc R_2$ with $\mc R_1=\{1,4\}$ and $\mc R=\{2,3\}$ is such that $W_{\mc R_q \mc R_q}\geq 0$ for $q$ in $\{1,2\}$ and $W_{\mc R_q \mc R_r}\leq 0$ for $q\neq r$, $q$, $r$ in $\{1,2\}$. According to Lemma \ref{lemma:balanced}, there exists a gauge transformation $[\sigma]$ such that $\mc R$ is a coordinating set of $\mc G^{[\sigma]}$. Indeed, if we consider the gauge transformation $[\sigma]$ with $\sigma=[1,-1,-1,1,1,1]$, we obtain that $W^{[\sigma]}=[\sigma]W[\sigma]$ is such that

\section{Main results }\label{sec:results}
In this section, we present our main results. 

Before proceeding, we introduce some notation that will play a crucial role in the following.
For every node $i$ in $\mc V$ and subset of nodes $\mc B\subseteq\mc V$, we define
\be\label{B-outdegree}w_i^{\mc B} = \sum_{j\in \mc B} {\color{black}|W_{ij}|}\,,\ee
to be its $\mc B$-\textit{out-degree}. 
In the special case when $\mc B=\mc V$ coincides with the whole node set, we simply refer to $$w_i=w_i^{\mc V}\,,$$ as the \textit{out-degree} of a node $i$ in $\mc V$ and let $w=|W|\1$ be the vector of out-degrees. 

We will often consider binary partitions of $\mc V$ of the type 
\be\label{binary-partition}\mc V={\mc R}\cup{\mc S}\,,\qquad \mc R\cap\mc S=\emptyset\,,\ee 
%where ${\mc R}$ (and sometimes also $\mc S$) is a coordinating set. We will 
and identify the strategy profile space as  the Cartesian product 
$$\mc X=\mc X_{\mc R}\times \mc X_{\mc S}\,,$$ where $\mc X_{\mc R}=\mc A^{{\mc R}}$ and $\mc X_{\mc S}=\mc A^{{\mc S}}$. Correspondingly, we decompose every strategy profile $x$ in $\mc X$ as 
$$x=(x_{\mc R},x_{\mc S})\,,$$ where $x_{\mc R}$ in $\mc X_{\mc R}$ is the strategy profile of the players in $\mc R$ and $x_{\mc S}$ in $\mc X_{\mc S}$ is the strategy profile of the  players in $\mc S$. 

For every strategy profile $z$ in $\mc X_{\mc S}$, we consider the 
SNC game with binary actions on the subnetwork $\mc G_{\mc R}$ with external field 
$$h^{(z)}=h_{\mc R}+W_{\mc R\mc S}z\in \R^{\mc R}\,,$$ 
i.e., the game with player set ${\mc R}$, action set $\mc A=\{\pm1\}$, and utility functions
\begin{equation}\label{eq:perturbeh_coord}
	u_i^{(z)}(y) =u_i(y,z)= y_i \sum_{j \in \cp} W_{ij} y_j + y_i \sum_{j \in \mc S} W_{ij}z_j+y_ih_i\,,
\end{equation}
for every player $i$ in $\cp$ and strategy profile $y$ in $\mc X_{\mc R}$. We shall refer to this game as the \emph{$\mc R$-restricted} SNC game with strategy profile of players in $\mc S$ frozen to $z$.

Analogously, for a given strategy profile $y$ in $\mc X_{\mc R}$, the $\mc S$-restricted game with strategy profile of players in $\mc R$ frozen to $y$ refers to the game with player set $\mc S$,  action set $\mc A=\{\pm1\}$,  and utility functions
\be\label{eq:S-utilities}
	u_i^{(y)}(z) = u_i(y,z)=  z_i \sum_{j \in \mc S} W_{ij}z_j+z_i \sum_{j \in \cp} W_{ij} y_j+z_ih_i\,,
\ee
for every player $i$ in $\mc S$ and strategy profile $z$ in $\mc X_{\mc S}$.
This can be interpreted as the SNC game with binary actions on the subnetwork $\mc G_{\mc S}$ with external field 
$$h^{(y)}=h_{\mc S}+W_{\mc S\mc R}y\in \R^{\mc R}\,. $$ 

We denote by $\mc N_{\mc R}^{(z)}$ the set of Nash equilibria of the $\mc R$-restricted SNC game with strategy profile of players in $\mc S$ frozen to $z$ and by $\mc N_{\mc S}^{(y)}$ the set of Nash equilibria of the $\mc S$-restricted SNC game with strategy profile of players in $\mc R$ frozen to $y$. 




\subsection{Existence of Nash equilibria}\label{sec:existence}
In this subsection, we investigate the existence of Nash equilibria of SNC games with binary actions.  

First, we consider a binary partition of the set of players as in \eqref{binary-partition}, such that the subnetwork $\mc G_{\mc R}$ is unsigned, and we look for Nash equilibria of the SNC game whose projection on the coordinating set $\mc R$ %$\bar{\mc R}\subseteq \mc R$ 
is a consensus strategy profile, i.e., $$x^*=(a\1, z^*)\,,$$ for some $a=\pm 1$. 
Our first result, stated below, guarantees the existence of such Nash equilibria in terms of two properties of the $\mc R$- and $\mc S$-restricted SNC games, respectively: the first one, cohesiveness, limits the influence that players in $\mc S$ can have on the players in $\mc R$, the second one ensures that the $\mc S$-restricted SNC game with strategy profile of players in $\mc R$ frozen to a consensus admits a Nash equilibrium.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:mixed1}
Consider a SNC game with binary actions on a network $\mc G=(\mc V,\mc E,W)$ with external field $h$,  and a binary partition \eqref{binary-partition} such that $\mc G_{\mc R}$ is unsigned. Assume that 
	there exists an action $a$ in $\{\pm1\}$ such that 
			\be\label{assumptioni}w^{{\mc R}}_i +ah_i\geq w^{{\mc S}}_i\,,\qquad \forall i\in\mc R\,,\ee
and  that \be\label{NSnon-empty}\mc N_{{\mc S}}^{(a\1)}\ne\emptyset\,.\ee
	Then, there exists a Nash equilibrium $x^*$ in $\mc N$ such that \be\label{x*R=a1}x^*_{\mc R}=a\1\,.\ee %the set $\mc N \cap \mc T_a$ is non-empty.
\end{proposition}
\begin{IEEEproof}         
Let $x^*$ in $\mc X$ be a strategy profile such that $x^*_{\mc R}=a\1$ and $x^*_{\mc S}=z^*$ in $\mc N_{{\mc S}}^{(a\1)}$ is a Nash equilibrium of the $\mc S$-restricted SNC game with strategy profile of players in $\mc S$ frozen to $a\1$. 
We will now prove that $x^*$ is a Nash equilibrium of the SNC game. 
	Since $z^*\in\mc N_{{\mc S}}^{(a\1)}$, what we are left to show is that $a\in \mc B_i(x_{-i}^*)$ for every player $i$ in $\mc R$. % Then, 
	 Since $W_{ij}\geq 0$ for every player $i$ and $j$ in $\mc R$, 
from  \eqref{eq:perturbeh_coord} this is equivalent to %verifying that
	$$
	a\left(aw_i^{{\mc R}}+h_i+(W_{{\mc R}{\mc S}}z^*)_i\right)\geq -a\left(aw_i^{{\mc R}}+h_i+(W_{{\mc R}{\mc S}}z^*)_i\right)\,,$$
	or, equivalently, that
	\be\label{wiR}w_i^{{\mc R}}+ah_i\geq -a(W_{{\mc R}{\mc S}}z^*)_i\,,\qquad \forall i\in\mc R\,.\ee
	Since $$w^{{\mc S}}_i\geq -a(W_{{\mc R}{\mc S}}z^*)_i\,,\qquad  \forall i\in\mc R\,,$$ \eqref{wiR} follows from \eqref{assumptioni}. This completes the proof. 
\end{IEEEproof}\medskip
\begin{remark} \label{remark:cohesive}
	In the special case when $h=0$, i.e., when all players are unbiased, using the identity $w_i^{{\mc S}}=w_i-w_i^{{\mc R}}$, we can rewrite condition \eqref{assumptioni} in Proposition \ref{prop:mixed1} as $$w_i^{{\mc R}}\geq w_i/2\,,\qquad \forall i\in{\mc R}\,.$$ 
	This says that every node in ${\mc R}$ has at least half of the weight of its out-links towards other nodes in ${\mc R}$. In the terminology introduced in \cite{Morris:2000}, this says that ${\mc R}$ is a $1/2$-cohesive subset of $\mc V$ relative to the unsigned graph $(\mc V,\mc E, |W|)$.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
Notice that the two networks of Examples \ref{ex:discoord} and \ref{ex:3ringanticoord}, for which Nash equilibria did not exist, were missing just one of the two assumptions in Proposition \ref{prop:mixed1}. Precisely, condition \eqref{assumptioni} was not satisfied by the network in Figure \ref{fig:disc_game} (a), while condition \eqref{NSnon-empty} was not satisfied by the network in Figure \ref{fig:disc_game} (b). We also observe that global BR-reachability is not guaranteed by conditions \eqref{assumptioni} and  \eqref{NSnon-empty}  alone, as already noticed in Example \ref{ex:nostability}. 
\end{remark}

We now present the following result extending Proposition \ref{prop:mixed1} to cases when $\mc G_{\mc R}$ is structurally balanced rather than unsigned. In this case, provided that $\mc R$ remains cohesive, we can determine sufficient conditions for the existence of Nash equilibria $x^*$ of the SNC game whose restriction $\tau=x^*_{\mc R}$ to the set $\mc R$ is such that the $[\tau]$-transformed subnetwork $\mc G_{\mc R}^{[\tau]}$ is unsigned.

\begin{IEEEproof}
	%Consider any $\sigma$ as in Proposition \ref{pr2} and 
	Let $\sigma$ in $\mc X$ be such that $\sigma_{\mc R}=\tau$ and $\sigma_{\mc S}=\1$. %In the forthcoming derivations, we will indicate $\sigma=(\tau,\1)$.
Consider the  associated gauge transformation $[\sigma]$ and the SNC game with binary actions on the $[\sigma]$-transformed network  $\mc G^{[\sigma]}$ with external field $h^{[\sigma]}$. 
%	Consider $\sigma$ in $\mc X$ such that $\sigma_{\mc R}=\tau$ and $\sigma_{\mc S}=\1$, %In the forthcoming derivations, we will indicate $\sigma=(\tau,\1)$.
%and the associated gauge transformation $[\sigma]$. Consider the 
%SNC game with binary actions on the $[\sigma]$-transformed network 
%$\mc G^{[\sigma]}$ defined \eqref{sigmaG} with external field $h^{[\sigma]}$ as in \eqref{sigmad}. 
Observe that condition \eqref{tauWtau} ensures that $\mc G^{[\sigma]}_{\mc R}$ is unsigned.  
Moreover, assumption \eqref{wRitau} implies that 
	\be\label{cond1}w_i^\mc R+h^{[\sigma]}_i \geq w_i^{\mc S},\qquad \forall i\in\mc R\,,\ee
	where $w_i^{\mc R}$ and $w_i^{\mc S}$ denote, respectively, the $\mc R$- and $\mc S$-out-degrees of node $i$ (as defined in \eqref{B-outdegree}) that are the same in both the original network $\mc G$ and the $[\sigma]$-transformed one $\mc G^{[\sigma]}$, since gauge transformations do not alter degrees.
Furthermore, it follows from equation \eqref{sigmau} that 	
%	. Moreover, we notice from Proposition \ref{pr2}  that the utilities for the SNC game associated with $\tilde{\mc G}$ and $\tilde d$, restricted to $\mc S$, are given by 
	$$u_i^{[\sigma]}(\1,  z)=u_i([\sigma](\1, z))=u_i(\tau, z)\,,\qquad \forall i\in\mc S\,,$$
	which, together with assumption \eqref{NStau},  implies that 
	$$(\mc N_{[\sigma]})_{{\mc S}}^{(\1)}=\mc N_{{\mc S}}^{(\tau)}\ne\emptyset\,.$$
	Therefore, the $[\sigma]$-transformed SNC game % with binary actions on the network 
%$\mc G^{[\sigma]}$ with external field $h^{[\sigma]}$ 
satisfies all the assumptions of Proposition \ref{prop:mixed1}, hence it admits a Nash equilibrium $\tilde x^*$ in $\mc N_{[\sigma]}$ such that $\tilde x^*_{\mc R}=\1$. 
Lemma \ref{lemma:NashGauge} then implies that $x^*=[\sigma]\tilde x^*\in\mc N$ is a Nash equilibrium for the SNC game with binary actions on $\mc G$ with external field $h$. Finally, observe  that $$x^*_{\mc R}=([\sigma]\tilde x^*)_{\mc R}=[\tau]\1=\tau\,,$$
so that \eqref{xRtau} holds true, thus completing the proof. 
\end{IEEEproof}\medskip








Observe that assumption \eqref{NStau} in  Theorem \ref{theo:main-existence}, namely  the fact that the set $\mc N_{{\mc S}}^{(\tau)}$ of Nash equilibria of the $\mc S$-restricted SNC game with strategy profile of players in $\mc R$ frozen to $\tau$, is automatically verified when the subnetwork $\mc G_{\mc S}$ is either undirected or structurally balanced itself. This leads to the following corollaries.

\begin{remark}Corollaries \ref{th:mixed_existence1} and \ref{th:mixed_existence2}  significantly generalize previous results where the existence of (pure strategy) Nash equilibria was proved only for network coordination or network anti-coordination games over undirected graphs \cite{Ramazi.Riehl.Cao:2016}.  Moreover, Corollary \ref{th:mixed_existence2}  applies to the mixed network coordination/anti-coordination games studied in \cite{vanelli2020games, arditti2021equilibria}.\end{remark}

	Consider the graph in Figure \ref{fig:graph1} and let $h=0$. 
	Observe that, for all $i$ in $\mc R$, it holds that
	$w_i^{\mc R}\geq w_i^{\mc S}$. Since the subnetwork $\mc G_{\mc R}$ is unsigned and the subsetwork $\mc G_{\mc S}$ is undirected, 
	Corollary \ref{th:mixed_existence2} implies the existence of two Nash equilibria $x^*$ and $x^{**}$ in $\mc N$ such that $x^*_{\mc R}=\1=-x^{**}_{\mc R}$.

\begin{example}[cont'd]
	Consider the graph in Figure \ref{fig:sb}. As previously observed, the subset $\mc R=\{1, \dots, 4\}$ is such that the graph $\mc G_{\mc R}$ is structurally balanced. Indeed, if we consider the gauge transformation $[\sigma]$ with $\sigma=[1,-1,-1,1,1,1]$, we obtain that $W^{[\sigma]}=[\sigma]W[\sigma]\geq 0$. Furthermore, for $h_i=0$, we have $w^{\mc R}\vert_{\mc R}=(4,3, 4, 3)> w^{\mc S}\vert_{\mc R}=(1,1,1,1) $. Since $\mc G_{\mc S}$ is undirected (no links), by Corollary \ref{th:mixed_existence2}, this implies that, for $\tau=(1,-1,-1,1)$, there exists a polarized Nash equilibrium, that is, a Nash equilibrium where $x_i^*=\tau_i$ for all $i$ in $\mc R$. For instance, the strategy profile $x^*=(1,-1,-1,1,-1,1)$ is a Nash equilibrium of the game. Notice that, since $\mc G_{\mc S}$ has no links, Corollary \ref{th:mixed_existence1} applies too.

%\end{example}



% In the following subsection, we will  determine sufficient conditions for stability of the set of Nash equilibria where coordinating players are at consensus.

\subsection{Stability of Nash equilibria}

%\tcr{PARAGRAFO DA RISCRIVERE O ELIMINARE}
We now present results on the global stability of Nash equilibria of SNC games. Before proceeding, it is convenient to reconsider the SNC game in Example \ref{ex:nostability}, whose set of Nash equilibria was shown to be not globally BR-reachable. A closer look at this example suggests that this is a direct consequence of the topological structure of the underlying network displayed in Figure \ref{fig:noeq_nostability}. %: this network is not \tcr{strongly connected}, more precisely, the subnetwork induced by the subset of coordinating players, 
This network contains two components $\{1,2,3\}$ and $\{5,6,7\}$, each of which without any out-link towards other nodes in the graph. This decomposition of the graph is what prevents the coordinating players to reach a consensus starting from a polarized initial condition. 
The observation above motivates the following definition that introduces a property of the graph guaranteeing that similar decompositions are not possible. The proposed definition also accounts for the external field $h$. It will be at the basis of the results presented in this subsection.
 \begin{definition}\label{def:indecomp}
 Consider a network $\mc G= (\mc V, \mc E, W) $ and two vectors  $h^-$ and $h^+$ in $\R^\mc V$ such that $h^{-}\leq h^+$. We say that $\mc G$ is  $(h^-,h^+)$-indecomposable if for every binary partition %\tcr{QUI I DUE INSIEMI NON SONO VUOTI MENTRE PRIMA SI', GIUSTO?}
 \be\label{binarypartition+-}\mc V = \mc V^-\cup \mc V^+\,,\qquad \mc V^-\cap\mc V^+=\emptyset\,,\qquad\mc V^-\ne\emptyset\ne\mc V^+\,,\ee 
 there exists a node $i$ in $\mc V$ such that either
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ind1}
	i \in \mc V^+ \text{ and } w_i^{\mc V^+} + h_i^+<  w_i^{\mc V^-}
	\end{equation}
	or 
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:ind2} 
		i \in \mc V^- \text{ and } w_i^{\mc V^-}-h_i^- < w_i^{\mc V^+}\,.
	\end{equation}
\end{definition}


The following example illustrates the notion of indecomposability introduced in Definition \ref{def:indecomp} above.

	\end{tikzpicture}	
	\caption{Graph considered in Example \ref{ex:dec1}.}
	\label{fig:indec}
\end{figure}


\begin{example}\label{ex:dec1}
	The network $\mc G$ in Figure \ref{fig:indec} is $(h^{-}, h^{+})$-indecomposable for $h^{+}=(3,2,0,2)=-h^{-} $. To see this, first notice that, for any partition where $|\mc V^+|=|\mc V^-|=2$, node $3$ satifies either \eqref{eq:ind1} or \eqref{eq:ind2} as a direct consequence of the facts that its out-degree is $w_3=3$ and $h_3^-=h_3^+=0$. 
Suppose instead that $|\mc V^-	|=1$. A direct check shows that the node in $\mc V^-$ satisfies \eqref{eq:ind2}. The case when $|\mc V^+|=1$ is identical. %\tcr{VA RIAGGIUNTA UNA PARTE}


	The network $\mc G$ in Figure \ref{fig:indec} is not $(h^{-}, h^{+})$-indecomposable for $h^{+}=\1$ and  $h^{-} = -h^{+}$. Indeed, if we take the partition $\mc V^+=\{1,4\}$ and $\mc V^-=\{2,3\}$, we have that $w_1^{\mc V^+}+h_1^+=3\geq 2= w_1^{\mc V^-}$, $w_4^{\mc V^+}+h_4^+=3\geq 1 = w_4^{\mc V^-}$, $w_2^{\mc V^+}-h_2^-=2\geq 1= w_2^{\mc V^+}$ and $w_3^{\mc V^-}-h_3^-=2\geq 2=w_3^{\mc V^+}$. Then, $\nexists i$ in $\mc V^+$ or $\mc V^-$ such that either \eqref{eq:ind1} or \eqref{eq:ind2} is violated.
\end{example}

%The indecomposability property introduced in Definition \ref{def:indecomp} can be given the following interpretation in terms of robustness of SNC games. Consider a strategic game with player set $\mc V$, action space $\mc A=\{\pm1\}$ for every player, and utility functions  
%\be\label{utility-netcoord} u_i(x)=x_i\sum_{j\in\mc V} W_{ij}x_j+h_ix_i\,,\ee 
%for every player $i$ in $\mc V$, 
Consider a SNC game with binary actions on a network $\mc G=(\mc V,\mc E,W)$ with external field $h$ such that 
\be\label{h-bounds} h^-_i\le h_i\le h_i^+\,,\qquad\forall i\in\mc V\,.\ee
Given a binary partition as in \eqref{binarypartition+-}, consider the strategy profile $x$ in $\mc X$ with  $$x_{\mc V^+}=\1\,,\qquad x_{\mc V^-}=-\1\,.$$ 
Then, conditions \eqref{eq:ind1} and \eqref{eq:ind2} imply that there exists a player $i$ in either  $\mc V^+$ or $\mc V^-$  that is not playing best response in strategy profile $x$. This implies that the SNC game on $\mc G$ with eternal field $h$  admits no coexistent Nash equilibria, i.e., no Nash equilibria other than, possibly, consensus strategy profiles. Notice that the absence of coexistent Nash equilibria implied by the $(h^-,h^+)$-indecomposability of the graph is robust with respect to changes of the vector $h$ in the hyper-rectangle $\{h\in\R^{\mc V}:\,\eqref{h-bounds}\}$.


We will make use of a result in \cite{arditti2024robust} that ensures, for network coordination games on $(h^-,h^+)$-indecomposable unsigned networks, the existence of a BR-path from every strategy profile $x$ to a consensus strategy profile that is independent from the specific choice of the vector $h$ satisfying \eqref{h-bounds}. Precisely, \cite[Theorem 4(i)]{arditti2024robust} implies the following.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma-robust}  Consider an unsigned network $\mc G= (\mc V, \mc E, W) $ and two vectors  $h^-$, $h^+$ in $\R^\mc V$ for which $\mc G$ is $(h^-,h^+)$-indecomposable. Then, for every strategy profile $x^{(0)}$ in $\mc X$, there exists an $l$-tuple of strategy profiles $(x^{(1)},\ldots,x^{(l)})$,  with $1\le l\leq n$, such that $x^{(l)}\in\{\pm\1\}$ is a consensus  profile, and $(x^{(0)},x^{(1)},\ldots,x^{(l)})$ is a BR-path for every SNC game with binary actions on $\mc G$ with external field $h$ satisfying \eqref{h-bounds}. 

\end{lemma}

We can now get the following result.



\begin{proposition}\label{prop:stability}
Consider a SNC game with binary actions on a network $\mc G=(\mc V,\mc E,W)$ with external field $h$ and a binary partition \eqref{binary-partition} such that $\mc G_{\mc R}$ is unsigned. Let $h^-$ and $h^+$ in $\R^{\mc R}$ be the vectors with entries 
\be\label{h+-}h^+_i=h_i+w_i^{{\mc S}}\,, \qquad h^-_i=h_i-w_i^{{\mc S}}\,,\qquad\forall i\in\mc R\,.\ee
Assume that $\mc G_{\mc R}$ is $(h^-,h^+)$-indecomposable and 
\be\label{wRi}w^{{\mc R}}_i -|h_i|> w^{{\mc S}}_i\,,\qquad\forall i\in\mc R\,.\ee
Then:  
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)] if, for every $a$ in $\{\pm1\}$, the set 
$\mc N_{{\mc S}}^{(a\1)}$  is globally BR-reachable for the $\mc S$-restricted SNC game with action profile of players in $\mc R$ frozen to $a\1$, 
then, the subset  of Nash equilibria \be\label{tildeN}\tilde{\mc N}=\{x^*\in\mc N:\,x^*_{\mc R}\in\{\pm\1\}\}\,,\ee  is non-empty and globally BR-reachable. 
	\end{enumerate}
	Moreover: 
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item[(ii)] if, for every $a$ in $\{\pm1\}$, there exists a non-empty subset $\bar{\mc N}_{{\mc S}}^{(a\1)}\subseteq \mc N_{{\mc S}}^{(a\1)}$ that is globally BR-stable for the $\mc S$-restricted SNC game with action profile of players in $\mc R$ frozen to $a\1$, then there exists a non-empty globally BR-stable subset $\ov{\mc N}\subseteq\tilde{\mc N}$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{IEEEproof} 
Fix an arbitrary strategy profile $x$ in $\mc X$ and let $z=x_{\mc S}$. 
On the one hand, since the subnetwork $\mc G_{\mc R}$ is unsigned and $(h^-,h^+)$-indecomposable, Lemma \ref{lemma-robust} implies that the set of consensus strategy profiles $\{\pm\1\}\subseteq\mc X_{\mc R}$ is globally BR-reachable for the $\mc R$-restricted network coordination game with action profile of players in $\mc S$ frozen to $z$, so that there exists a length-$l$ BR-path $((y^{(0)},z),(y^{(1)},z),\ldots,(y^{(l)},z))$ with $y^{(0)}=x_{\mc R}$ and $y^{(l)}=a\1$, for some $a$ in $\{\pm1\}$. 
	On the other hand, since the set $\mc N_{{\mc S}}^{(a\1)}$  is globally BR-reachable for the $\mc S$-restricted SNC game with action profile of players in $\mc R$ frozen to $y=a\1$, there exists a length-$m$ BR-path 
	$((a\1,z^{(0)}),(a\1,z^{(1)}),\ldots,(a\1,z^{(m)}))$ with $z^{(0)}=z$ and $z^{(m)}=z^*\in\mc N_{{\mc S}}^{(a\1)}$. 
	
	Observe that the strategy profile $x^*$ in $\mc X$ with $x^*_{\mc R}=a\1$ and  $x^*_{\mc S}=z^*$ is a Nash equilibrium for the original SNC game with binary actions on $\mc G$ with external field $h$, as every player $i$ in $\mc R$ is playing best response thanks to \eqref{wRi}, while every player $j$ in $\mc S$ is playing best response since $z^*\in\mc N_{{\mc S}}^{(a\1)}$. We have thus found a length-$(l+m)$ BR-path 
	$((y,z),(y^{(1)},z),\ldots,(a\1,z),(a\1,z^{(1)}),\ldots,(a\1,z^*))$ from $x$ to $x^*$ in $\mc N$ with $x^*_{\mc R}=a\1$. 
	The arbitrariness of initial strategy profile $x$ in $\mc X$ implies that the set $\tilde{\mc N}$ defined in \eqref{tildeN}, i.e., the subset of Nash equilibria in which players in $\mc R$ are at consensus is globally BR-reachable, thus proving point (i) of the claim. 
	
	To prove point (ii) of the claim, let $a$ in $\{\pm1\}$ be as above. Since there exists a non-empty subset $\bar{\mc N}_{{\mc S}}^{(a\1)}\subseteq \mc N_{{\mc S}}^{(a\1)}$ that is globally BR-stable for the $\mc S$-restricted SNC game with strategy profile of players in $\mc R$ frozen to $a\1$, then the BR-path above can be constructed leading to $x^*$ such that $x^*_{\mc S}\in\bar{\mc N}_{{\mc S}}^{(a\1)}$. Now, notice that assumption \eqref{wRi} implies that,  in the strategy profile $x^*$ defined above, every player $i$ in ${\mc R}$ is playing a strict best response $\mc B_i(x^*_{-i})=\{a\}$. This, combined with the BR-invariance of $\ov{\mc N}_{\mc S}^{(a\1)}$ for the $\mc S$-restricted SNC game with strategy profile of players in $\mc R$ frozen to $a\1$, implies that 
	$$\ov{\mc N}=\{x^*\in\mc X:\,x^*_{\mc R}\in\{\pm\1\}\,,\, x^*_{\mc S}\in\bar{\mc N}_{{\mc S}}^{(x^*_{\mc R})}\}\,,$$
	is a non-empty, globally BR-stable subset of Nash equilibria, thus proving point (ii) of the claim. 
	\end{IEEEproof}

\begin{remark} In the special case of a network coordination game, i.e., when the network $\mc G$ is unsigned, Proposition \ref{prop:stability} provides sufficient conditions for consensus strategy profiles $\pm\1$ to be Nash equilibria and form a globally BR-reachable set. In this setting, the assumptions reduce to the following two conditions: (a) that $\mc G_{\mc R}$ is $(h^-,h^+)$-indecomposable; and (b) that $w_i>|h_i|$ for every $i$ in $\mc V$. Condition (a) ensures that no coexistent Nash equilibrium exists, while condition (b) ensures that both consensus strategy profiles $\pm\1$ are strict Nash equilibria. We notice that in this case conditions (a) and (b) are not just sufficient but also necessary for the set $\{\pm\1\}$ of consensus strategy profiles to be globally BR-stable. 
\end{remark}

We now present the following result extending Proposition \ref{prop:stability} to cases when $\mc G_{\mc R}$ is structurally balanced rather than unsigned. 

\begin{theorem}\label{theo:main-stability}
	Consider a SNC game with binary actions on a network $\mc G=(\mc V,\mc E,W)$ with external field $h$. 
	 Consider a binary partition as in \eqref{binary-partition}, such that $\mc G_\mc R$ is structurally balanced 
	 and let $\tau$ in $\mc X_{\mc R}$ be such that $\mc G_{\mc R}^{[\tau]}$ is unsigned. 
	Let $h^-$ and $h^+$ in $\R^{\mc R}$ be the vectors with entries 
\be\label{h+-tau}h^+_i=\tau_ih_i+w_i^{{\mc S}}\,, \qquad h^-_i=\tau_ih_i-w_i^{{\mc S}}\,,\qquad\forall i\in\mc R\,.\ee
Assume that $\mc G_{\mc R}^{[\tau]}$ is $(h^-,h^+)$-indecomposable and that \eqref{wRi} holds true. 
%\be\label{wRi}w^{{\mc R}}_i -|h_i|> w^{{\mc S}}_i\,,\qquad\forall i\in\mc R\,.\ee
Then:  
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)] if, for $y=\pm\tau$ in $\mc X_{\mc R}$, the set 
$\mc N_{{\mc S}}^{(y)}$  is globally BR-reachable for the $\mc S$-restricted SNC game with the strategy profile in $\mc R$ frozen to $y$, 
then, the subset of Nash equilibria \be\label{Ntau}\ov {\mc N}=\{x^*\in\mc N:x^*_{\mc R}\in\{\pm\tau\}\}\,,\ee  is globally BR-reachable. 
	\end{enumerate}
	Moreover: 
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item[(ii)] if, for $y=\pm\tau$ in $\mc X_{\mc R}$, there exists a non-empty subset $\bar{\mc N}_{{\mc S}}^{(y)}\subseteq \mc N_{{\mc S}}^{(y)}$ that is globally BR-stable for the $\mc S$-restricted SNC game where actions of players in $\mc R$ are frozen to $y$, then 
	there exists a globally BR-stable subset of Nash equilibria contained in $\ov{\mc N}$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\begin{IEEEproof}
Let $\sigma$ in $\mc X$ be such that $\sigma_{\mc R}=\tau$ and $\sigma_{\mc S}=\1$. %In the forthcoming derivations, we will indicate $\sigma=(\tau,\1)$.
Consider the  associated gauge transformation $[\sigma]$ and the $[\sigma]$-transformed network  $\mc G^{[\sigma]}$. Observe that the assumptions ensure that $(\mc G^{[\sigma]})_{\mc R}=\mc G_{\mc R}^{[\tau]}$ is unsigned, that $\mc G_{\mc R}$ is $(h^-,h^+)$-indecomposable and that \eqref{wRi} holds true. We can thus apply Proposition \eqref{prop:stability} to the $[\sigma]$-transformed SNC game, whose points (i) and (ii) imply, respectively, points (i) and (ii) of the claim. 
\end{IEEEproof}\medskip



Similarly to Section \ref{sec:existence}, we may derive the following two corollaries from Theorem \ref{theo:main-stability}.

\begin{corollary}\label{coro:reach} 
Consider a SNC game on a network $\mc G=(\mc V,\mc E,W)$ with external field $h$. 
Consider a binary partition as in \eqref{binary-partition} such that $\mc G_{\mc R}$ and $\mc G_{\mc S}$ are both structurally balanced, and let $\tau$ in $\mc X_{\mc R}$ be such that $\mc G_{\mc R}^{[\tau]}$ is unsigned. Let $h^-$ and $h^+$ in $\R^{\mc R}$ be the vectors with entries as in \eqref{h+-}.
If $\mc G_{\mc R}$ is $(h^-,h^+)$-indecomposable and \eqref{wRi} holds true, then the subset of Nash equilibria \eqref{Ntau} is globally BR-reachable.
\end{corollary}
\begin{IEEEproof} If the subnetwork $\mc G_{\mc S}$ is structurally balanced, then, for every $\tau$ in $\mc X_{\mc R}$, Proposition \ref{prop:structurally-balanced-equilibria} implies that the set  $\mc N_{{\mc S}}^{(y)}$  is globally BR-reachable for the $\mc S$-restricted SNC game with the strategy profile in $\mc R$ frozen to $y=\pm\tau$. 
The claim then follows from Theorem \ref{theo:main-stability}(i).

\begin{example}\label{ex:non_dec_sup}
 Consider a SNC game on the graph in Figure \ref{fig:non_dec_sup} with $h=0$. Observe that  $\mc R=\{1,\dots, 4\}$ and $\mc S=\mc V\setminus \mc R$ are  coordinating sets with $w^{\mc R}\vert_{\mc R}-\abs{h}_{\mc R}=(4,3,3,3)> w^{\mc S}\vert_{\mc R}=(2,2,0,1)$. %Then, according to Corollary \ref{th:mixed_existence1}, there exists at least one Nash equilibrium where players in $\mc R$ are at consensus.
Furthermore, the graph $\mc G_{\mc R}$ is $(h^+, h^-)$-indecomposable for $h^{+}=h_{\mc R} +w^{\mc S}\vert_{\mc R}=(2,2,0,1)$ and $h^-=h_{\mc R} -w^{\mc S}\vert_{\mc R}=-h^+$. This can be proved following the same reasoning as in Example \ref{ex:dec1} (notice that $\mc G_{\mc R}$ coincides with the graph in Figure \ref{fig:non_dec}). %according to point (a) in Corollary \ref{coro:stability}, we obtain $h^{+}=w^{\mc S}\vert_{\mc R}=(3,2,0,2)$ and $h^-=-w^{\mc S}\vert_{\mc R}=-h^+$. In Example \ref{ex:dec1}, we observed that the graph $\mc G_\mc R$ in Figure \ref{fig:non_dec} is $(h^{-},h^{+})$-indecomposable for such $h^{+}$ and $h^-$. 
Then, according to Corollary \ref{coro:reach}, the set of Nash equilibria where the players in ${\mc R}$ are at consensus is globally BR-reachable.
Notice that the set of Nash equilibria 
$$\mc N=\{(a\1_{\mc R},-a,a),(a\1_{\mc R},a,-a) , a = \pm 1\}\,.$$ is not globally BR-stable. Indeed, for every $x^*$ in $\mc N$, the best response of player $5$ is $\mc B_5(x_{-5}^*)=\{\pm 1\}$, while $6$ is playing a strict best response. Therefore, there exists a best-response path (e.g., $((a\1_{\mc R},-a,a), (a\1_{\mc R},a,a))$ for $a=\pm 1$) that leaves the set of Nash equilibria. 
\end{example}
\begin{corollary}\label{coro:stability} 
Consider a SNC game on a network $\mc G=(\mc V,\mc E,W)$ with external field $h$. 
Consider a binary partition as in \eqref{binary-partition} such that $\mc G_{\mc R}$ is structurally balanced and $\mc G_{\mc S}$ is undirected. Let $\tau$ in $\mc X_{\mc R}$ be such that $\mc G_{\mc R}^{[\tau]}$ is unsigned and let $h^-$ and $h^+$ in $\R^{\mc R}$ be the vectors with entries as in \eqref{h+-}.
If $\mc G_{\mc R}$ is $(h^-,h^+)$-indecomposable and \eqref{wRi} holds true, then there exists a globally BR-stable subset of Nash equilibria.
\end{corollary}
\begin{IEEEproof}
	If the subnetwork $\mc G_{\mc S}$ is undirected,  then Proposition \ref{pr:pot_mixed} implies that, for $y=\pm\tau$ in $\mc X_{\mc R}$, there exists a non-empty subset $\bar{\mc N}_{{\mc S}}^{(y)}\subseteq \mc N_{{\mc S}}^{(y)}$ that is globally BR-stable for the $\mc S$-restricted SNC game where actions of players in $\mc R$ are frozen to $y$.
The claim then follows from Theorem \ref{theo:main-stability}(ii). 
\end{IEEEproof}

\begin{example}\label{ex:non_dec}
Consider the SNC game on the graph in Figure \ref{fig:non_dec} with $h=(2,0,0,-1,0,0)$. Observe that $\mc R=\{1,\dots, 4\}$ is a coordinating set with $w^{\mc R}\vert_{\mc R}=(4,3,3,3)$ and  $w^{\mc S}\vert_{\mc R}=(1,2,0,1)$ and $\mc G_{\mc S}$ with $\mc S=\mc V\setminus \mc R$ is undirected.
It holds that 
$$
w^{\mc R}\vert_{\mc R}-\abs{h}_{\mc R}=(2,3,3,2)>w^{\mc S}\vert_{\mc R}= (1,2,0,1)\,.
$$
 %Then, according to Corollary \ref{th:mixed_existence2}, there exists at least one Nash equilibrium where the players in $\mc R$ are at consensus. 
Furthermore, the graph $\mc G_\mc R$ is $(h^{-},h^{+})$-indecomposable for $\tilde h^{+}=h\vert_{\mc R}+w^{\mc S}\vert_{\mc R}=(3,2,0,0)$ and $\tilde h^-=h\vert_{\mc R}-w^{\mc S}\vert_{\mc R}=(1,-2,0,-2)$. Again, this can proved following the same reasoning as in Example \ref{ex:dec1} and \ref{ex:non_dec_sup}. Then,  according to Corollary \ref{coro:stability}, the set of Nash equilibria where the players in ${\mc R}$ are at consensus contains a globally BR-stable subset.
\end{example}
\begin{example}\label{ex:dec}
Consider now the SNC game on the graph in Figure \ref{fig:dec} and let $h=0$. Analogously to Example \ref{ex:non_dec}, we have that $\mc R=\{1,\dots, 4\}$ is a coordinating set with $w^{\mc R}\vert_{\mc R}=(4,3,3,3)$, %, $\mc G_\mc R$ coincides with the graph in Figure \ref{fig:indec}
 and $\mc G_{\mc S}$ with $\mc S=\mc V\setminus \mc R$ is undirected. On the other hand, in this case, we have $w^{\mc S}\vert_{\mc R}=(1,1,1,1)$. 
Since $w^{\mc R}\vert_{\mc R}\geq w^{\mc S}\vert_{\mc R}$, Corollary \ref{th:mixed_existence2} holds and existence of a Nash equilibrium where the players in $\mc R$ are at consensus is guaranteed. However, %according to point (a) in Theorem \ref{theo:stability}, we have $h^{+}=h+w^{\mc S}\vert_{\mc R}=(1,1,1,1)$ and $h^-=d-w^{\mc S}\vert_{\mc R}=-h^+$. In Example \ref{ex:dec2}, we proved that $\mc G_{\mc R}$ is not 
$\mc G_{\mc R}$ is \textit{not} $(h^+,h^-)$-indecomposable for $h^{+}=h+w^{\mc S}\vert_{\mc R}=(1,1,1,1)$ and $h^-=h-w^{\mc S}\vert_{\mc R}=-h^+$. Indecomposability is indeed violated by $\mc R^{+}=\{1,4\}$ and $\mc R^-=\{2,3\}$. Therefore, Proposition \ref{prop:stability} and Theorem \ref{theo:main-stability} do not apply. Observe that $x^*=(1,-1,-1,1, -1,1, 1,-1)$ is a strict Nash equilibrium of the game where players in $\mc R$ are not at consensus. %Starting from this strategy profile, we will never reach a Nash equilibrium where coordinating agents are at consensus.
