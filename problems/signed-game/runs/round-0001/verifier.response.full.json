The core modeling convention (dependency arc i\u2192j iff W_ij \u2260 0 so u_i depends only on its out-neighbors) is consistently used. I audited each class and proof sketch.\\n\\nSound results (with correct reasoning):\\n- Undirected (W symmetric): exact potential; PNE exist. The potential \u03a6(x)=1/2\u2211_ij W_ij x_i x_j + \u2211_i h_i x_i is correct. Citing Monderer\u2013Shapley and the paper\u2019s Proposition is appropriate. The note about a BR-stable subset for undirected cases matches the paper (Catalano et al.).\\n- Unsigned (W \u2265 0): supermodular via increasing differences; PNE exist; the NE set is a lattice. BR-reachability follows via I-path arguments (binary actions imply I-paths are BR-paths).\\n- Structurally balanced: the gauge transform [\u03c3]W[\u03c3] \u2265 0 is equivalent to structural balance as defined. Mapping equilibria back via x = [\u03c3]y is correct; thus PNE exist.\\n- DAG dependency digraph: The backward induction argument is correct and exploits the orientation that u_i depends only on out-neighbors. The constructed profile is a PNE and is BR-reachable by mimicking the order.\\n- SCC-wise composition: Processing SCCs in reverse topological order is valid because players depend only on out-neighbors inside their SCC and in later SCCs. If each SCC admits a PNE for every external field (true for undirected or structurally balanced SCCs), concatenating yields a global PNE; the BR-path concatenation is valid.\\n- Cohesive core conditions (R,S split): The inequalities w_i^R + a h_i \u2265 w_i^S (or \u03c4-variant) correctly make the target consensus/polarization a best response for all i\u2208R; existence in S under frozen R follows (undirected/structurally balanced S), hence a global PNE. Weight-dominance |h_i|>\u2211_j|W_ij| also correctly gives a strict PNE x=sgn(h).\\n\\nMinor issues to fix/clarify:\\n- Be explicit that the structural balance definition here is directed: W_ij\u22650 within parts and \u22640 across parts; then \u03c3_i=+1 on one part, \u22121 on the other yields [\u03c3]W[\u03c3]\u22650. This differs from classic undirected Harary balance; please state the convention up front.\\n- When claiming \u201cglobally BR-reachable\u201d sets for supermodular games, point out we use I-path reachability (Tarski/Topkis) plus binary actions so I-paths become BR-paths; avoid overclaiming unconditional BR-convergence.\\n- In the SCC result, emphasize the \u201cuniversally PNE-admitting under arbitrary external fields\u201d property is the real requirement; undirected and structurally balanced are examples, but not necessarily exhaustive.\\n- Ensure all counterexamples use h=0 and clearly state orientation i\u2192j iff W_ij\u22600 to avoid confusion.\\n\\nNext steps:\\n- Characterize the maximal class of \u201cuniversally PNE-admitting\u201d SCCs beyond undirected/structurally balanced (e.g., exact potential polymatrix blocks, other monotone transformations).\\n- Give a polynomial-time checker for \u201cNE-guaranteed SCCs for all external fields.\u201d\\n- Explore necessary conditions (signed-cycle obstructions) for PNE nonexistence in strongly connected components.\\n- Document algorithm: detect DAG; else decompose into SCCs; test each SCC; if all are NE-guaranteed, construct a PNE by reverse topological induction; otherwise, search for cohesive cores.\\n\",\"summary_md\":\"Validated classes guaranteeing PNE in binary SNC games: (i) undirected (exact potential); (ii) unsigned (supermodular); (iii) structurally balanced (gauge to unsigned); (iv) DAG dependency digraphs (new, backward induction); (v) SCC decomposition where each SCC is NE-guaranteed for all external fields (e.g., undirected or structurally balanced) (new).

If the dependency digraph is acyclic, then for any W,h the game admits a PNE; moreover a BR-path to it exists.\\nProof. Let v_1,\u2026,v_n be a topological order with i\u2192j \u21d2 i<j. For k=n,\u2026,1, pick x_{v_k}\u2208argmax_{a\u2208{\u00b11}} a(h_{v_k}+\u2211_{j>k}W_{v_k j}x_{v_j}). Each u_{v_k} depends only on x_{v_j} with j>k, which are already fixed, so x_{v_k} is a best response in the final profile. Updating players in order n,n\u22121,\u2026,1 yields a BR-path to the constructed PNE.\\n\\nTheorem 2 (SCC-wise composition). Let C_1,\u2026,C_m be the strongly connected components (SCCs) of the dependency digraph ordered so edges go only from C_k to C_\u2113 with k<\u2113. Suppose each induced subgame on C_k admits a PNE for every external field (equivalently here: each C_k is either undirected or structurally balanced). Then the full game admits a PNE; a BR-path exists.\\nProof. Proceed by reverse topological order. For C_m (a sink SCC), utilities of i\u2208C_m depend only on x_{C_m} and h, so by the hypothesis on C_m there exists a PNE x^*_{C_m}. Suppose x^*_{C_{k+1}},\u2026,x^*_{C_m} fixed. For i\u2208C_k, u_i(x)=x_i(\u2211_{j\u2208C_k}W_{ij}x_j) + x_i(h_i+\u2211_{j\u2209C_k}W_{ij}x^*_j). Treating f^{(k)}=h_{C_k}+W_{C_k,>k}x^*_{>k} as an external field, by the hypothesis on C_k there is a PNE x^*_{C_k}. Concatenate x^*=(x^*_{C_1},\u2026,x^*_{C_m}). For i\u2208C_k, u_i depends only on x_{C_k} and on x in later SCCs, which are exactly those fixed when x^*_{C_k} was chosen; hence each i is best responding in x^*. A BR-path is obtained by concatenating BR-paths inside C_m,C_{m\u22121},\u2026,C_1, holding later components fixed at each stage.\\n\\nCorollary 2.1. If each SCC is undirected (exact potential) or structurally balanced (via Lemma 4 and Lemma 2), then the hypothesis of Theorem 2 holds, so a PNE exists and is BR-reachable.\\n\\nRemark. The DAG case is the special case when all SCCs are singletons.

If |h_i|>\u2211_j |W_{ij}| \u2200i, then x_i=sgn(h_i) defines a strict PNE.\\nProof. For any x_{\u2212i}, the sign maximizing u_i is sgn(h_i+\u2211_j W_{ij} x_j)=sgn(h_i), because |\u2211_j W_{ij} x_j|<|h_i|.

(b) Structurally balanced on U: \u2203\u03c3_U with [\u03c3_U]W_{UU}[\u03c3_U]\u22650; after y\u21a6[\u03c3_U]y the game is unsigned (supermodular) \u21d2 PNE for all f; mapping back preserves PNE.\\n\\nTheorem (SCC composition \u21d2 PNE). Let C_1,\u2026,C_m be the SCCs of the dependency digraph ordered so edges go only from C_k to C_\u2113 with k<\u2113. If each induced subgame on C_k is universally PNE-admitting (e.g., undirected or structurally balanced), then for any W,h the full game admits a PNE. A BR-path exists.\\nProof. Process SCCs in reverse topological order. For the sink C_m, u_i depends only on x_{C_m} and h, so pick a PNE x^*_{C_m}. Suppose x^*_{C_{k+1}},\u2026,x^*_{C_m} are fixed. For i\u2208C_k, u_i(x)=x_i(\u2211_{j\u2208C_k}W_{ij}x_j)+x_i(h_i+\u2211_{j\u2209C_k}W_{ij}x^*_j). Treat f^{(k)}=h_{C_k}+W_{C_k,>k}x^*_{>k} as an external field. By the hypothesis on C_k, choose a PNE x^*_{C_k}. The concatenation x^*=(x^*_{C_1},\u2026,x^*_{C_m}) is a PNE since each i\u2208C_k depends only on x_{C_k} and later components (fixed when x^*_{C_k} was chosen). Concatenating BR-paths inside C_m,C_{m\u22121},\u2026,C_1 yields a global BR-path.\\n\\nDiscussion and relevance\\n- The DAG result is a clean, graph-theoretic guarantee that covers arbitrary signs and weights.\\n- The SCC composition theorem modularizes PNE existence: it suffices to certify each SCC as universally PNE-admitting (e.g., undirected or structurally balanced). This strictly includes DAGs (all SCCs are singletons) and globally undirected/structurally balanced graphs as special cases, and provides a constructive method to build a PNE by solving SCCs from sinks upward.\"}}",
