Validated classes guaranteeing PNE in binary SNC games: (i) undirected (exact potential); (ii) unsigned (supermodular); (iii) structurally balanced (gauge to unsigned); (iv) DAG dependency digraphs (new, backward induction); (v) SCC decomposition where each SCC is NE-guaranteed for all external fields (e.g., undirected or structurally balanced) (new). Cohesive-core conditions from the paper were also restated correctly. Short, rigorous proofs for (iv) and (v) were prepared for proofs.md and promoted to output.md. Minor clarifications: state directed structural balance convention, rely on I→BR reachability in binary for supermodular games. Next: characterize universally PNE-admitting SCCs beyond current examples and devise checking algorithms.
