{"feedback_md":"Overall, the provers converged on a coherent set of sufficient graph-theoretic conditions guaranteeing pure Nash equilibria (PNE) in signed network coordination (SNC) games with binary actions. The core modeling convention (dependency arc i→j iff W_ij ≠ 0 so u_i depends only on its out-neighbors) is consistently used. I audited each class and proof sketch.\n\nSound results (with correct reasoning):\n- Undirected (W symmetric): exact potential; PNE exist. The potential Φ(x)=1/2∑_ij W_ij x_i x_j + ∑_i h_i x_i is correct. Citing Monderer–Shapley and the paper’s Proposition is appropriate. The note about a BR-stable subset for undirected cases matches the paper (Catalano et al.).\n- Unsigned (W ≥ 0): supermodular via increasing differences; PNE exist; the NE set is a lattice. BR-reachability follows via I-path arguments (binary actions imply I-paths are BR-paths).\n- Structurally balanced: the gauge transform [σ]W[σ] ≥ 0 is equivalent to structural balance as defined. Mapping equilibria back via x = [σ]y is correct; thus PNE exist.\n- DAG dependency digraph: The backward induction argument is correct and exploits the orientation that u_i depends only on out-neighbors. The constructed profile is a PNE and is BR-reachable by mimicking the order.\n- SCC-wise composition: Processing SCCs in reverse topological order is valid because players depend only on out-neighbors inside their SCC and in later SCCs. If each SCC admits a PNE for every external field (true for undirected or structurally balanced SCCs), concatenating yields a global PNE; the BR-path concatenation is valid.\n- Cohesive core conditions (R,S split): The inequalities w_i^R + a h_i ≥ w_i^S (or τ-variant) correctly make the target consensus/polarization a best response for all i∈R; existence in S under frozen R follows (undirected/structurally balanced S), hence a global PNE. Weight-dominance |h_i|>∑_j|W_ij| also correctly gives a strict PNE x=sgn(h).\n\nMinor issues to fix/clarify:\n- Be explicit that the structural balance definition here is directed: W_ij≥0 within parts and ≤0 across parts; then σ_i=+1 on one part, −1 on the other yields [σ]W[σ]≥0. This differs from classic undirected Harary balance; please state the convention up front.\n- When claiming “globally BR-reachable” sets for supermodular games, point out we use I-path reachability (Tarski/Topkis) plus binary actions so I-paths become BR-paths; avoid overclaiming unconditional BR-convergence.\n- In the SCC result, emphasize the “universally PNE-admitting under arbitrary external fields” property is the real requirement; undirected and structurally balanced are examples, but not necessarily exhaustive.\n- Ensure all counterexamples use h=0 and clearly state orientation i→j iff W_ij≠0 to avoid confusion.\n\nNext steps:\n- Characterize the maximal class of “universally PNE-admitting” SCCs beyond undirected/structurally balanced (e.g., exact potential polymatrix blocks, other monotone transformations).\n- Give a polynomial-time checker for “NE-guaranteed SCCs for all external fields.”\n- Explore necessary conditions (signed-cycle obstructions) for PNE nonexistence in strongly connected components.\n- Document algorithm: detect DAG; else decompose into SCCs; test each SCC; if all are NE-guaranteed, construct a PNE by reverse topological induction; otherwise, search for cohesive cores.\n","summary_md":"Validated classes guaranteeing PNE in binary SNC games: (i) undirected (exact potential); (ii) unsigned (supermodular); (iii) structurally balanced (gauge to unsigned); (iv) DAG dependency digraphs (new, backward induction); (v) SCC decomposition where each SCC is NE-guaranteed for all external fields (e.g., undirected or structurally balanced) (new).

Let G=(V,E,W) be a directed signed network with binary actions x_i∈{±1} and utilities u_i(x)=h_i x_i + x_i ∑_j W_{ij} x_j.

If W is symmetric, the game is an exact potential game with Φ(x)=1/2∑_{i,j} W_{ij} x_i x_j + ∑_i h_i x_i. Hence a PNE exists.\nProof. If x,y differ only at i with y_i=−x_i, Φ(y)−Φ(x)=2(h_i+∑_j W_{ij}x_j)x_i = u_i(y)−u_i(x). Finite exact potential games admit PNE.\n\nLemma 2 (Unsigned ⇒ supermodular). If W_{ij}≥0 for all i,j, then for δ_i(x)=u_i(+1,x_{−i})−u_i(−1,x_{−i})=2h_i+2∑_j W_{ij}x_j and x≤y, δ_i(y)−δ_i(x)=2∑_j W_{ij}(y_j−x_j)≥0, so the game has increasing differences and admits a PNE.\n\nLemma 3 (Gauge transform and Nash correspondence). For σ∈{±1}^V, define [σ] diagonal, W^{[σ]}=[σ]W[σ], h^{[σ]}=[σ]h. Then u_i^{[σ]}(x)=u_i([σ]x). Consequently, y is a PNE in the [σ]-transformed game iff x=[σ]y is a PNE in the original game.\nProof. u_i^{[σ]}(x)=x_i(∑_j W^{[σ]}_{ij}x_j)+h^{[σ]}_i x_i = u_i([σ]x). Best-response sets transform via multiplication by σ_i.\n\nLemma 4 (Directed structural balance ⇔ unsigned via gauge). Suppose V admits a bipartition V=V_1⊔V_2 with W_{ij}≥0 for i,j in the same part and W_{ij}≤0 across parts. Let σ_i=+1 on V_1, σ_i=−1 on V_2. Then W^{[σ]}=[σ]W[σ] is entrywise nonnegative. Conversely, if ∃σ with W^{[σ]}≥0, the induced bipartition by σ has nonnegative within-part and nonpositive across-part weights.\n\nTheorem 1 (DAGs guarantee PNE). If the dependency digraph is acyclic, then for any W,h the game admits a PNE; moreover a BR-path to it exists.\nProof. Let v_1,…,v_n be a topological order with i→j ⇒ i<j. For k=n,…,1, pick x_{v_k}∈argmax_{a∈{±1}} a(h_{v_k}+∑_{j>k}W_{v_k j}x_{v_j}). Each u_{v_k} depends only on x_{v_j} with j>k, which are already fixed, so x_{v_k} is a best response in the final profile. Updating players in order n,n−1,…,1 yields a BR-path to the constructed PNE.\n\nTheorem 2 (SCC-wise composition). Let C_1,…,C_m be the strongly connected components (SCCs) of the dependency digraph ordered so edges go only from C_k to C_ℓ with k<ℓ. Suppose each induced subgame on C_k admits a PNE for every external field (equivalently here: each C_k is either undirected or structurally balanced). Then the full game admits a PNE; a BR-path exists.\nProof. Proceed by reverse topological order. For C_m (a sink SCC), utilities of i∈C_m depend only on x_{C_m} and h, so by the hypothesis on C_m there exists a PNE x^*_{C_m}. Suppose x^*_{C_{k+1}},…,x^*_{C_m} fixed. For i∈C_k, u_i(x)=x_i(∑_{j∈C_k}W_{ij}x_j) + x_i(h_i+∑_{j∉C_k}W_{ij}x^*_j). Treating f^{(k)}=h_{C_k}+W_{C_k,>k}x^*_{>k} as an external field, by the hypothesis on C_k there is a PNE x^*_{C_k}. Concatenate x^*=(x^*_{C_1},…,x^*_{C_m}). For i∈C_k, u_i depends only on x_{C_k} and on x in later SCCs, which are exactly those fixed when x^*_{C_k} was chosen; hence each i is best responding in x^*. A BR-path is obtained by concatenating BR-paths inside C_m,C_{m−1},…,C_1, holding later components fixed at each stage.\n\nCorollary 2.1. If each SCC is undirected (exact potential) or structurally balanced (via Lemma 4 and Lemma 2), then the hypothesis of Theorem 2 holds, so a PNE exists and is BR-reachable.\n\nRemark. The DAG case is the special case when all SCCs are singletons. Lemma 4 plus Lemma 3 ensures structurally balanced components remain PNE-admitting under arbitrary external fields.\n\nTheorem 3 (Weight-dominance). If |h_i|>∑_j |W_{ij}| ∀i, then x_i=sgn(h_i) defines a strict PNE.\nProof. For any x_{−i}, the sign maximizing u_i is sgn(h_i+∑_j W_{ij} x_j)=sgn(h_i), because |∑_j W_{ij} x_j|<|h_i|. Hence each player has a unique best response equal to sgn(h_i)."},"output_update":{"action":"append","content":"Main Results\n\nWe identify graph classes for which every signed network coordination game with binary actions x_i∈{±1} and utilities u_i(x)=h_i x_i + x_i∑_j W_{ij}x_j admits a pure Nash equilibrium (PNE). The dependency arc i→j is present iff W_{ij}≠0, so u_i depends only on its out-neighbors.\n\n1) Directed acyclic dependency graphs (DAGs)\nTheorem (DAG ⇒ PNE). If the dependency digraph is acyclic, then for any real weights W and bias vector h, the game admits a PNE. Moreover, a best-response (BR) path to it exists.\nProof. Take a topological order v_1,…,v_n with i→j ⇒ i<j. Construct x by backward induction: for k=n,…,1 pick x_{v_k}∈argmax_{a∈{±1}} a(h_{v_k}+∑_{j>k}W_{v_k j}x_{v_j}). Because u_{v_k} depends only on out-neighbors v_j with j>k (already fixed), x_{v_k} is a best response in the final profile. Updating players in order n,n−1,…,1 yields a BR-path to this PNE.\n\n2) SCC-wise composition under per-component PNE admissibility\nDefinition (Universally PNE-admitting component). An induced subgame on U⊆V is universally PNE-admitting if for every external field f∈ℝ^U the game with utilities u_i(y)=y_i(∑_{j∈U}W_{ij}y_j+f_i) admits a PNE.\nExamples. (a) Undirected W_{ij}=W_{ji} on U: exact potential ⇒ PNE for all f. (b) Structurally balanced on U: ∃σ_U with [σ_U]W_{UU}[σ_U]≥0; after y↦[σ_U]y the game is unsigned (supermodular) ⇒ PNE for all f; mapping back preserves PNE.\n\nTheorem (SCC composition ⇒ PNE). Let C_1,…,C_m be the SCCs of the dependency digraph ordered so edges go only from C_k to C_ℓ with k<ℓ. If each induced subgame on C_k is universally PNE-admitting (e.g., undirected or structurally balanced), then for any W,h the full game admits a PNE. A BR-path exists.\nProof. Process SCCs in reverse topological order. For the sink C_m, u_i depends only on x_{C_m} and h, so pick a PNE x^*_{C_m}. Suppose x^*_{C_{k+1}},…,x^*_{C_m} are fixed. For i∈C_k, u_i(x)=x_i(∑_{j∈C_k}W_{ij}x_j)+x_i(h_i+∑_{j∉C_k}W_{ij}x^*_j). Treat f^{(k)}=h_{C_k}+W_{C_k,>k}x^*_{>k} as an external field. By the hypothesis on C_k, choose a PNE x^*_{C_k}. The concatenation x^*=(x^*_{C_1},…,x^*_{C_m}) is a PNE since each i∈C_k depends only on x_{C_k} and later components (fixed when x^*_{C_k} was chosen). Concatenating BR-paths inside C_m,C_{m−1},…,C_1 yields a global BR-path.\n\nDiscussion and relevance\n- The DAG result is a clean, graph-theoretic guarantee that covers arbitrary signs and weights.\n- The SCC composition theorem modularizes PNE existence: it suffices to certify each SCC as universally PNE-admitting (e.g., undirected or structurally balanced). This strictly includes DAGs (all SCCs are singletons) and globally undirected/structurally balanced graphs as special cases, and provides a constructive method to build a PNE by solving SCCs from sinks upward."}}
