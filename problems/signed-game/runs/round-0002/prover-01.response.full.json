The feedback acknowledged our solid results but called for more clarity. Now, I need to propose more testable ideas, including proving new lemmas regarding \u201cuniversally PNE-admitting\u201d SCC classification and necessary conditions. \n\nI\u2019ll define UPNEA for an SCC and explore small SCC sizes, particularly 2\u00d72 cases.",

Similarly, for u2, the dependency is on x1. \n\nI want to characterize the existence of pure Nash equilibria (PNE) by understanding these inequalities for different player profiles.

Give a short, checkable proof (constructive for sufficiency; cycle obstruction for necessity).\\n- Refine SCC-wise analysis: (i) 2-node SCCs are universally PNE-admitting for all external fields iff the two arcs have the same sign (equivalently, the 2-node signed subgraph is structurally balanced). (ii) Odd-negative-cycle obstruction with dominant edges: a sufficient condition for nonexistence under h=0.\\n- Note algorithmic implications: linear-time recognition (acyclicity), linear-time constructive PNE on DAGs; SCC topological construction under per-SCC guarantees (undirected/structural balance).\\n\\nTheorem 1 (graph-level classification: for all W,h)\\nLet G=(V,E) be the dependency digraph (i\u2192j iff W_{ij}\u22600). The following are equivalent:\\n(i) For every weight matrix W with zero diagonal supported on E and every h\u2208\u211d^V, the SNC game u_i(x)=h_i x_i + x_i\u2211_j W_{ij}x_j admits a pure Nash equilibrium.\\n(ii) G is acyclic (a DAG).\\nProof. (ii\u21d2i) Order vertices v_1,\u2026,v_n topologically so i\u2192j implies i<j. Construct x by backward induction: for k=n,\u2026,1, pick x_{v_k}\u2208argmax_{a\u2208{\u00b11}} a(h_{v_k}+\u2211_{j>k}W_{v_kj}x_{v_j}). Because u_{v_k} depends only on out-neighbors among indices >k, x_{v_k} is a best response in the final profile. This yields a PNE. (i\u21d2ii) Suppose G has a directed cycle C=(i_1\u2192i_2\u2192\u2026\u2192i_k\u2192i_1). Choose h=0 and set all off-cycle weights to 0. Pick cycle weights so that the local best-response constraints along C become x_{i_\u2113}=s_\u2113 x_{i_{\u2113+1}} with s_\u2113\u2208{\u00b11} and \u220f_{\u2113=1}^k s_\u2113=-1 (e.g., take all W_{i_\u2113,i_{\u2113+1}}<0 if k is odd; or pick an odd number of them negative if k is even). Then any PNE would have to satisfy these k constraints simultaneously, which is impossible since multiplying them yields 1=\u220f s_\u2113=-1. Hence there exists W,h with no PNE, contradicting (i). \u220e\\nRemarks.\\n- The necessity argument is robust: taking large-magnitude cycle weights (and zero elsewhere) makes the contradictions strict; we used h=0.\\n- Thus, among graph-only guarantees (no structure assumed on W), DAGs are exactly the graphs that force existence for all W,h.\\n\\nProposition 2 (2-node SCCs; universal across external fields, fixed W)\\nConsider a 2-player SCC with utilities u_1(x)=x_1(W_{12}x_2+h_1), u_2(x)=x_2(W_{21}x_1+h_2). The subgame admits a pure Nash equilibrium for every h\u2208\u211d^2 if and only if W_{12} and W_{21} have the same sign (including zero), equivalently the 2-node signed subgraph is structurally balanced.\\nProof. If sgn(W_{12})=sgn(W_{21}), then after the gauge transform \u03c3=(1,sign(W_{12})), [\u03c3]W[\u03c3] has both off-diagonals \u22650, hence the game is supermodular for any h and has a PNE. Conversely, if sgn(W_{12})\u2260sgn(W_{21}), with h=0 one gets the \u201cdiscoordination\u201d game (Example: W_{12}=1, W_{21}=-1) which has no PNE, hence not universally PNE-admitting. \u220e\\n\\nLemma 3 (odd-negative-cycle obstruction under dominance)\\nLet C be a directed cycle i_1\u2192\u2026\u2192i_k\u2192i_1. Suppose h=0 and there exist weights on cycle edges only, with |W_{i_\u2113,i_{\u2113+1}}|\u226b0 and sgn(W_{i_\u2113,i_{\u2113+1}}) chosen so that \u220f_{\u2113=1}^k(-sgn(W_{i_\u2113,i_{\u2113+1}}))=-1. Then the SNC game has no PNE.\\nProof. For each i_\u2113, the unique out-neighbor on the cycle dominates the local field, forcing the best-response constraint x_{i_\u2113}= -sgn(W_{i_\u2113,i_{\u2113+1}}) x_{i_{\u2113+1}}. Multiplying around the cycle yields a contradiction as above. \u220e\\nCorollary. Any SCC containing such an odd-parity signed cycle is not universally PNE-admitting across external fields (for the fixed W in Lemma 3).\\n\\nSCC-wise constructive existence (under per-SCC structure)\\n- If each SCC U induces a subgame that is universally PNE-admitting for all external fields on U (examples: W_{UU} symmetric \u21d2 exact potential; or \u2203\u03c3_U with [\u03c3_U]W_{UU}[\u03c3_U]\u22650 \u21d2 supermodular), then the full game admits a PNE. Construction: compute SCC condensation DAG, process SCCs in reverse topological order, freezing later components as external fields for earlier ones. This reproduces the theorem stated in the previous round with a precise dependency orientation justification.\\n\\nAlgorithmic notes\\n- Graph-only guarantee: test acyclicity in O(|V|+|E|). If DAG, compute a PNE by a single backward pass (linear time).\\n- With per-SCC structural tests: compute SCCs (Tarjan/Kosaraju), then per SCC test: (a) symmetry W_{ij}=W_{ji} (trivial); (b) structural balance via parity constraints \u03c3_i\u03c3_j=sgn(W_{ij}) (union-find with parity in O(|U|+|E_U|)); gauge if feasible. Then solve per-SCC PNE (potential: any local-improvement path terminates; unsigned after gauge: monotone BR).\\n\\nConnections to known sufficient classes (recap)\\n- Undirected W: exact potential \u21d2 PNE for any h.\\n- Unsigned W\u22650: supermodular \u21d2 PNE for any h.\\n- Structurally balanced (directed sense): \u2203\u03c3 s.t. [\u03c3]W[\u03c3]\u22650 \u21d2 PNE for any h.\\n- DAGs: unconditional (graph-only) guarantee for all W,h (Theorem 1).\\n- Cohesive cores R\u2294S from the paper: if w_i^R + a h_i \u2265 w_i^S (or w_i^R + \u03c4_i h_i \u2265 w_i^S) and the S-subgame (with R frozen) has PNE (e.g., S undirected or structurally balanced), then a global PNE exists with x_R fixed to consensus/polarization.\\n- Weight-dominance: if |h_i|>\u2211_j|W_{ij}| \u2200i, then x=sgn(h) is a strict PNE.\\n\\nExamples\\n- Directed 3-cycle with W_{i,i+1}=-1, h=0: no PNE (Lemma 3, k=3). Even cycles can also be made obstructive by choosing an odd number of negative edges on the cycle.\\n- 2-node discoordination W_{12}=1, W_{21}=-1, h=0: no PNE (Proposition 2 converse).\\n- DAG chain 1\u21922\u21923 with arbitrary W,h: PNE via backward induction x_3\u2208argmax, then x_2, then x_1.\\n\\nObstacles and limitations\\n- Full characterization of \u201cuniversally PNE-admitting for all external fields\u201d SCCs (for fixed W) beyond the undirected and structurally balanced cases remains open. Lemma 3 gives a broad obstruction family.\\n- Constructive per-SCC computation may be exponential in worst-case for potential games (general local-search), though existence is guaranteed.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Attempt necessity in the SCC setting: show that if W_{UU} is neither symmetric nor gauge-to-unsigned, then there exists an external field f making the subgame on U PNE-free (extend Lemma 3 to weighted, multi-outdegree cases).\\n- Develop a parity-constraint/2-SAT formulation to test structural balance in directed sense and integrate weights to detect dominant contradictory cycles.\\n- Provide end-to-end algorithm: (1) if G is DAG, output PNE by backward pass; else (2) decompose into SCCs and test each for symmetry or structural balance; if all pass, assemble PNE in reverse topological order; else (3) attempt cohesive-core conditions to salvage existence in mixed components.
