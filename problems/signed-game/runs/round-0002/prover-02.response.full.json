It seems crucial that there's a valid assignment to these nodes so they can all best respond while the cycle nodes stay fixed. This approach simplifies to solving the general game for the outside nodes, which may involve dependencies that could potentially lead to failure in achieving a Perfect Nash Equilibrium (PNE).

Both rely on a clean dominance inequality on a directed simple cycle that forces local best-responses irrespective of all other influences.\\n\\nSetup and shorthand\\n- SNC game: u_i(x)=h_i x_i + x_i\u2211_j W_{ij}x_j, x_i\u2208{\u00b11}. Player i depends only on out-neighbors {j: W_{ij}\u22600}.\\n- For a directed simple cycle C=(i_1\u2192i_2\u2192\u2026\u2192i_k\u2192i_1), let s_r=sgn(W_{i_r,i_{r+1}})\u2208{\u00b11} and define the dominance margin at i_r:\\n  M_{i_r}:=|W_{i_r,i_{r+1}}| \u2212 (|h_{i_r}| + \u2211_{j\u2260i_{r+1}} |W_{i_r j}|).\\n- Dominance on C means M_{i_r}>0 for all r.\\n\\nLemma 1 (Dominant negative cycle obstruction)\\nAssume there exists a directed simple cycle C with dominance (M_{i_r}>0 \u2200r) and negative sign product \u220f_{r=1}^k s_r = \u22121. Then the SNC game has no pure Nash equilibrium.\\nProof.\\nFix any profile x. Under dominance, for each r the best response at i_r is uniquely forced by the successor\u2019s action: BR condition is x_{i_r}=s_r x_{i_{r+1}} because sgn(h_{i_r}+\u2211_j W_{i_rj}x_j)=sgn(W_{i_r,i_{r+1}}x_{i_{r+1}}). In a PNE x^*, these k equalities must hold simultaneously, hence x^*_{i_1}=(\u220f_r s_r)x^*_{i_1}=\u2212x^*_{i_1}, impossible. \u220e\\n\\nLemma 2 (Dominant positive cycle is universally PNE-admitting)\\nAssume a directed simple cycle C has dominance (M_{i_r}>0 \u2200r) and positive sign product \u220f_{r=1}^k s_r = +1. Then, for the subgame on C with arbitrary \u201cexternal field\u201d f\u2208\u211d^C (i.e., utilities u_i(y)=y_i(\u2211_{j\u2208C}W_{ij}y_j + f_i)), there exist exactly two PNE on C, obtained by choosing x_{i_1}\u2208{\u00b11} arbitrarily and propagating x_{i_r}=s_r x_{i_{r+1}} around the cycle; these best-responses are independent of f.\\nProof.\\nFor any f and any assignments outside C, the total nondominant contribution to i_r\u2019s BR term has magnitude \u2264 |h_{i_r}|+\u2211_{j\u2260i_{r+1}}|W_{i_rj}|, strictly smaller than |W_{i_r,i_{r+1}}| by dominance; hence the sign of the BR term equals sgn(W_{i_r,i_{r+1}} x_{i_{r+1}}), yielding the constraints x_{i_r}=s_r x_{i_{r+1}}. Positive product makes these constraints consistent with exactly two solutions. \u220e\\n\\nCorollary (SCC composition with dominant cycles)\\nLet the SCCs of the dependency digraph be C_1,\u2026,C_m, ordered so edges go only from C_k to C_\u2113 with k<\u2113. Suppose each SCC is one of:\\n- undirected (exact potential \u21d2 PNE for all external fields);\\n- structurally balanced (gauge to unsigned \u21d2 supermodular \u21d2 PNE for all external fields);\\n- a directed simple cycle satisfying dominance with positive sign product (by Lemma 2).\\nThen the full game admits a PNE; a BR-path exists (solve SCCs in reverse topological order).\\nProof.\\nEach SCC is \u201cuniversally PNE-admitting\u201d under arbitrary external fields; apply the SCC composition theorem from the notes/current output. \u220e\\n\\nExamples\\n- Obstruction (no PNE): 3-cycle 1\u21922\u21923\u21921 with W_{12}=W_{23}=W_{31}=\u22122, h=0, no other out-arcs. Dominance holds (M_i=2>0) and product is (\u22121)^3=\u22121 \u21d2 no PNE (Lemma 1).\\n- Admissible cycle SCC: 4-cycle 1\u21922\u21923\u21924\u21921 with signs (+1,\u22121,\u22121,+1), weights |W|=3 on cycle, no other out-arcs, h=0. Dominance holds, product (+1)(\u22121)(\u22121)(+1)=+1. The two PNE on the cycle are the two assignments consistent with x_i = s_i x_{i+1}. If other SCCs exist downstream, compose by reverse topological order.\\n\\nObstacles/limits\\n- Dominance is strong; without it, other neighbors can flip BR signs and break the cycle constraints. Lemma 1 then need not hold; counterexamples exist.\\n- The \u201ccycle\u201d class enlarges but does not exhaust universally PNE-admitting SCCs.\\n\\nNext steps (auditable)\\n- Relax dominance to \u201cstrict majority\u201d on each i along the cycle and quantify robustness margins.\\n- Characterize all universally PNE-admitting SCCs: e.g., exact-potential polymatrix blocks beyond symmetry, or classes defined by positive sign of every directed cycle plus suitable weight inequalities.\\n- Implement a checker: find SCCs; within each, test (i) symmetric, (ii) structurally balanced (2-coloring of sign constraints), (iii) dominant-cycle condition (linear-time along cycles if SCC is a simple cycle).
