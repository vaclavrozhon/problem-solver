  "content": "Ideas\n- Add a new graph class that guarantees existence of a pure Nash equilibrium (PNE) beyond the ones already listed (undirected, unsigned, structurally balanced, SCC composition, DAG): functional digraphs (outdegree \u2264 1) whose directed cycles are sign-positive. This strictly generalizes DAGs and is orthogonal to global undirectedness; within this class we give a necessary-and-sufficient characterization for \u201cPNE exists for all external fields h.\u201d\n- Record a simple sufficient condition for consensus equilibria based on row sums, useful as a quick certificate (weight/bias based, not purely structural, but auditable and often applicable).\n\nFunctional digraphs (outdegree \u2264 1)\nDefinition. The dependency digraph has i\u2192j iff W_{ij}\u22600. Call it functional if every i has at most one outgoing arc. Each node i either has no successor or a unique successor s(i).\nFor i with successor s(i), denote w_i:=W_{i s(i)}\u22600.\nDefine the best-response map along an arc via\nf_i(x_{s(i)}) = argmax_{a\u2208{\u00b11}} a(h_i + w_i x_{s(i)}) \u2208 {\u00b11}.\nFor x\u2208{\u00b11}, the value f_i(x) is: constant +1 if h_i\u2265|w_i|; constant \u22121 if h_i\u2264\u2212|w_i|; otherwise f_i(x)=sign(w_i)\u00b7x (identity if w_i>0; flip if w_i<0).\n\nTheorem A (PNE on functional digraphs with positive directed cycles). Let the dependency digraph be functional. Assume every directed cycle C has positive sign, i.e., \u220f_{(i\u2192j)\u2208C} sign(W_{ij})=+1. Then for every h\u2208\u211d^V there exists a PNE. Moreover, one can construct a BR-path to a PNE.\nProof. A functional digraph decomposes into disjoint directed cycles, each with in-arborescences feeding into cycle vertices. Fix a cycle C=(i_1\u2192i_2\u2192\u2026\u2192i_L\u2192i_1). Consider the unary composition F_C:=f_{i_1}\u2218f_{i_L}\u2218\u2026\u2218f_{i_2}:{\u00b11}\u2192{\u00b11}.\nIf any node on C has |h_i|\u2265|w_i|, then f_i is constant; hence F_C is constant, so F_C has a fixed point x_{i_1}\u2208{\u00b11}. If every node on C has |h_i|<|w_i|, then each f_i(x)=sign(w_i)\u00b7x, so F_C(x)=(\u220f_{i\u2208C} sign(w_i))\u00b7x=x by positivity. Thus F_C=identity, with two fixed points. In both cases there exists x_{i_1} making x_{i_k}=f_{i_k}(x_{i_{k+1}}) consistent around the cycle, so all i\u2208C best respond.\nFor each arborescence edge j\u2192i with successor i already assigned, set x_j:=f_j(x_i) (unique choice). Since a node\u2019s utility depends only on its (unique) successor and h_j, this propagation yields a best response at every arborescence node. Concatenating these local choices over all components yields a global profile x where every player best responds; hence x is a PNE. A BR-path is obtained by updating players in reverse topological order of the forest branches ending at cycles, and finally resolving each cycle according to the chosen fixed point. \u220e\n\nProposition B (Necessity within functional class for uniform guarantee). In functional digraphs, the condition \u201cevery directed cycle is sign-positive\u201d is necessary for the existence of a PNE for all external fields h. More precisely, if some directed cycle C has \u220f_{(i\u2192j)\u2208C} sign(W_{ij})=\u22121, then for h=0 the game has no PNE.\nProof. With h=0 and w_i\u22600 on C, best responses along C require x_{i_k}=sign(w_{i_k})\u00b7x_{i_{k+1}} for all k. Multiplying around C yields x_{i_1}=(\u220f sign(w_{i_k}))\u00b7x_{i_1}=\u2212x_{i_1}, impossible. Hence no PNE. \u220e\n\nCorollary C (DAGs). DAGs are functional with no cycles; Theorem A recovers the known guarantee: a PNE exists for all h, constructible by backward induction from sinks.\n\nRow-sum consensus certificate\nLemma D (Row-sum consensus). If h_i + \u2211_j W_{ij} \u2265 0 for all i, then x\u2261+1 is a PNE. If h_i + \u2211_j W_{ij} \u2264 0 for all i, then x\u2261\u22121 is a PNE.\nProof. At x\u2261+1, the unilateral deviation payoff difference is u_i(+1,x_{\u2212i})\u2212u_i(\u22121,x_{\u2212i})=2(h_i+\u2211_j W_{ij})\u22650. Similarly for x\u2261\u22121. \u220e\nRemark. This is weight/bias dependent, not purely structural; it gives a fast certificate of existence of a strict PNE when inequalities are strict.\n\nExamples\n- Negative 3-cycle (functional, h=0): W_{12},W_{23},W_{31}<0. Directed cycle sign is (\u22121)^3=\u22121. By Proposition B, no PNE: indeed the equations force x_1=\u2212x_2= x_3= \u2212x_1.\n- Positive 4-cycle (functional, h=0): let signs on edges be (+,+,\u2212,\u2212) in order, product +1. Then f_i are either identity or flip with an even number of flips; F_C=identity; two PNE on the cycle; arborescences propagate uniquely.\n- Mixed biases (functional, some |h_i|\u2265|w_i|): nodes with strong bias become constant responders; F_C is constant hence has a fixed point regardless of edge signs; Theorem A still applies under the positive-cycle assumption, but even if a cycle were negative, sufficiently strong biases can create PNE; Proposition B shows only that a uniform guarantee over all h fails when a negative cycle exists.\n\nConnections to existing results\n- Structural balance on SCCs implies, after a gauge transformation, that all internal edges are nonnegative. In functional SCCs (simple directed cycles), \u201cevery directed cycle positive\u201d is equivalent to SCC structural balance. Thus Theorem A refines the SCC composition pipeline by giving an explicit constructive proof in the functional case and shows necessity for uniform guarantees.\n- The SCC composition theorem then implies: if every SCC of the dependency digraph is either undirected (exact potential) or functional with all directed cycles positive (hence universally PNE-admitting), the full game has a PNE for all h, constructible by reverse topological order.\n\nObstacles\n- Extending the functional-cycle characterization to SCCs with outdegree > 1 is nontrivial: compositions become multivariate maps, and existence/necessity conditions are no longer captured by a single parity along cycles. Structural balance remains a sufficient condition, but necessity fails (there are non\u2013structurally-balanced SCCs admitting PNE for some h, and even for all h under special symmetry/weight constraints).\n- \u201cUniversally PNE-admitting SCCs\u201d beyond undirected/structurally balanced remain to be characterized. Ordinal potentials on SCCs might suffice, but a clean graph-theoretic certificate is missing.\n\nNext steps\n- Prove a full characterization for universal PNE-admissibility in functional SCCs with additional incoming/outgoing arcs to other SCCs (the proof above essentially does this; formalize within the SCC composition theorem).\n- Identify further SCC classes with universal PNE guarantee, e.g., exact/ordinal potential polymatrix blocks, or monotone (after switching) submodular/antitone components.\n- Algorithmics: (i) detect functional components; (ii) check cycle sign in O(m) time; (iii) construct PNE by cycle resolution plus tree backpropagation; (iv) integrate into SCC pipeline. Provide pseudocode and worst-case complexity bounds in a later round.\n- Explore necessary obstructions (e.g., negative directed cycles) beyond the functional class, and whether small forbidden-sign minors characterize non-universal SCCs.\n"
