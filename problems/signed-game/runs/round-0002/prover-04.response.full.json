For directed graphs, the key condition for switching to all-positive is that every undirected cycle has a positive product when considered as undirected. With directed edges, it's more complex. If every directed cycle is positive, it indicates the possibility of a topological ordering after sign switching. In sign patterns of matrices, the absence of negative directed cycles leads to monotone systems. There\u2019s also the concept of cooperative systems relying on nonnegative off-diagonal elements.",

This strictly generalizes DAGs and is orthogonal to global undirectedness; within this class we give a necessary-and-sufficient characterization for \u201cPNE exists for all external fields h.\u201d\\n- Record a simple sufficient condition for consensus equilibria based on row sums, useful as a quick certificate (weight/bias based, not purely structural, but auditable and often applicable).\\n\\nFunctional digraphs (outdegree \u2264 1)\\nDefinition. The dependency digraph has i\u2192j iff W_{ij}\u22600. Call it functional if every i has at most one outgoing arc. Each node i either has no successor or a unique successor s(i).\\nFor i with successor s(i), denote w_i:=W_{i s(i)}\u22600.\\nDefine the best-response map along an arc via\\nf_i(x_{s(i)}) = argmax_{a\u2208{\u00b11}} a(h_i + w_i x_{s(i)}) \u2208 {\u00b11}.\\nFor x\u2208{\u00b11}, the value f_i(x) is: constant +1 if h_i\u2265|w_i|; constant \u22121 if h_i\u2264\u2212|w_i|; otherwise f_i(x)=sign(w_i)\u00b7x (identity if w_i>0; flip if w_i<0).\\n\\nTheorem A (PNE on functional digraphs with positive directed cycles). Let the dependency digraph be functional. Assume every directed cycle C has positive sign, i.e., \u220f_{(i\u2192j)\u2208C} sign(W_{ij})=+1. Then for every h\u2208\u211d^V there exists a PNE. Moreover, one can construct a BR-path to a PNE.\\nProof. A functional digraph decomposes into disjoint directed cycles, each with in-arborescences feeding into cycle vertices. Fix a cycle C=(i_1\u2192i_2\u2192\u2026\u2192i_L\u2192i_1). Consider the unary composition F_C:=f_{i_1}\u2218f_{i_L}\u2218\u2026\u2218f_{i_2}:{\u00b11}\u2192{\u00b11}.\\nIf any node on C has |h_i|\u2265|w_i|, then f_i is constant; hence F_C is constant, so F_C has a fixed point x_{i_1}\u2208{\u00b11}. If every node on C has |h_i|<|w_i|, then each f_i(x)=sign(w_i)\u00b7x, so F_C(x)=(\u220f_{i\u2208C} sign(w_i))\u00b7x=x by positivity. Thus F_C=identity, with two fixed points. In both cases there exists x_{i_1} making x_{i_k}=f_{i_k}(x_{i_{k+1}}) consistent around the cycle, so all i\u2208C best respond.\\nFor each arborescence edge j\u2192i with successor i already assigned, set x_j:=f_j(x_i) (unique choice). Since a node\u2019s utility depends only on its (unique) successor and h_j, this propagation yields a best response at every arborescence node. Concatenating these local choices over all components yields a global profile x where every player best responds; hence x is a PNE. A BR-path is obtained by updating players in reverse topological order of the forest branches ending at cycles, and finally resolving each cycle according to the chosen fixed point. \u220e\\n\\nProposition B (Necessity within functional class for uniform guarantee). In functional digraphs, the condition \u201cevery directed cycle is sign-positive\u201d is necessary for the existence of a PNE for all external fields h. More precisely, if some directed cycle C has \u220f_{(i\u2192j)\u2208C} sign(W_{ij})=\u22121, then for h=0 the game has no PNE.\\nProof. With h=0 and w_i\u22600 on C, best responses along C require x_{i_k}=sign(w_{i_k})\u00b7x_{i_{k+1}} for all k. Multiplying around C yields x_{i_1}=(\u220f sign(w_{i_k}))\u00b7x_{i_1}=\u2212x_{i_1}, impossible. Hence no PNE. \u220e\\n\\nCorollary C (DAGs). DAGs are functional with no cycles; Theorem A recovers the known guarantee: a PNE exists for all h, constructible by backward induction from sinks.\\n\\nRow-sum consensus certificate\\nLemma D (Row-sum consensus). If h_i + \u2211_j W_{ij} \u2265 0 for all i, then x\u2261+1 is a PNE. If h_i + \u2211_j W_{ij} \u2264 0 for all i, then x\u2261\u22121 is a PNE.\\nProof. At x\u2261+1, the unilateral deviation payoff difference is u_i(+1,x_{\u2212i})\u2212u_i(\u22121,x_{\u2212i})=2(h_i+\u2211_j W_{ij})\u22650. Similarly for x\u2261\u22121. \u220e\\nRemark. This is weight/bias dependent, not purely structural; it gives a fast certificate of existence of a strict PNE when inequalities are strict.\\n\\nExamples\\n- Negative 3-cycle (functional, h=0): W_{12},W_{23},W_{31}<0. Directed cycle sign is (\u22121)^3=\u22121. By Proposition B, no PNE: indeed the equations force x_1=\u2212x_2= x_3= \u2212x_1.\\n- Positive 4-cycle (functional, h=0): let signs on edges be (+,+,\u2212,\u2212) in order, product +1. Then f_i are either identity or flip with an even number of flips; F_C=identity; two PNE on the cycle; arborescences propagate uniquely.\\n- Mixed biases (functional, some |h_i|\u2265|w_i|): nodes with strong bias become constant responders; F_C is constant hence has a fixed point regardless of edge signs; Theorem A still applies under the positive-cycle assumption, but even if a cycle were negative, sufficiently strong biases can create PNE; Proposition B shows only that a uniform guarantee over all h fails when a negative cycle exists.\\n\\nConnections to existing results\\n- Structural balance on SCCs implies, after a gauge transformation, that all internal edges are nonnegative. In functional SCCs (simple directed cycles), \u201cevery directed cycle positive\u201d is equivalent to SCC structural balance. Thus Theorem A refines the SCC composition pipeline by giving an explicit constructive proof in the functional case and shows necessity for uniform guarantees.\\n- The SCC composition theorem then implies: if every SCC of the dependency digraph is either undirected (exact potential) or functional with all directed cycles positive (hence universally PNE-admitting), the full game has a PNE for all h, constructible by reverse topological order.\\n\\nObstacles\\n- Extending the functional-cycle characterization to SCCs with outdegree > 1 is nontrivial: compositions become multivariate maps, and existence/necessity conditions are no longer captured by a single parity along cycles. Structural balance remains a sufficient condition, but necessity fails (there are non\u2013structurally-balanced SCCs admitting PNE for some h, and even for all h under special symmetry/weight constraints).\\n- \u201cUniversally PNE-admitting SCCs\u201d beyond undirected/structurally balanced remain to be characterized. Ordinal potentials on SCCs might suffice, but a clean graph-theoretic certificate is missing.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Prove a full characterization for universal PNE-admissibility in functional SCCs with additional incoming/outgoing arcs to other SCCs (the proof above essentially does this; formalize within the SCC composition theorem).\\n- Identify further SCC classes with universal PNE guarantee, e.g., exact/ordinal potential polymatrix blocks, or monotone (after switching) submodular/antitone components.\\n- Algorithmics: (i) detect functional components; (ii) check cycle sign in O(m) time; (iii) construct PNE by cycle resolution plus tree backpropagation; (iv) integrate into SCC pipeline. Provide pseudocode and worst-case complexity bounds in a later round.\\n- Explore necessary obstructions (e.g., negative directed cycles) beyond the functional class, and whether small forbidden-sign minors characterize non-universal SCCs.\\n\"}",
