Ideas
- Add a new graph class that guarantees existence of a pure Nash equilibrium (PNE) beyond the ones already listed (undirected, unsigned, structurally balanced, SCC composition, DAG): functional digraphs (outdegree ≤ 1) whose directed cycles are sign-positive. This strictly generalizes DAGs and is orthogonal to global undirectedness; within this class we give a necessary-and-sufficient characterization for “PNE exists for all external fields h.”
- Record a simple sufficient condition for consensus equilibria based on row sums, useful as a quick certificate (weight/bias based, not purely structural, but auditable and often applicable).

Functional digraphs (outdegree ≤ 1)
Definition. The dependency digraph has i→j iff W_{ij}≠0. Call it functional if every i has at most one outgoing arc. Each node i either has no successor or a unique successor s(i).
For i with successor s(i), denote w_i:=W_{i s(i)}≠0.
Define the best-response map along an arc via
f_i(x_{s(i)}) = argmax_{a∈{±1}} a(h_i + w_i x_{s(i)}) ∈ {±1}.
For x∈{±1}, the value f_i(x) is: constant +1 if h_i≥|w_i|; constant −1 if h_i≤−|w_i|; otherwise f_i(x)=sign(w_i)·x (identity if w_i>0; flip if w_i<0).

Theorem A (PNE on functional digraphs with positive directed cycles). Let the dependency digraph be functional. Assume every directed cycle C has positive sign, i.e., ∏_{(i→j)∈C} sign(W_{ij})=+1. Then for every h∈ℝ^V there exists a PNE. Moreover, one can construct a BR-path to a PNE.
Proof. A functional digraph decomposes into disjoint directed cycles, each with in-arborescences feeding into cycle vertices. Fix a cycle C=(i_1→i_2→…→i_L→i_1). Consider the unary composition F_C:=f_{i_1}∘f_{i_L}∘…∘f_{i_2}:{±1}→{±1}.
If any node on C has |h_i|≥|w_i|, then f_i is constant; hence F_C is constant, so F_C has a fixed point x_{i_1}∈{±1}. If every node on C has |h_i|<|w_i|, then each f_i(x)=sign(w_i)·x, so F_C(x)=(∏_{i∈C} sign(w_i))·x=x by positivity. Thus F_C=identity, with two fixed points. In both cases there exists x_{i_1} making x_{i_k}=f_{i_k}(x_{i_{k+1}}) consistent around the cycle, so all i∈C best respond.
For each arborescence edge j→i with successor i already assigned, set x_j:=f_j(x_i) (unique choice). Since a node’s utility depends only on its (unique) successor and h_j, this propagation yields a best response at every arborescence node. Concatenating these local choices over all components yields a global profile x where every player best responds; hence x is a PNE. A BR-path is obtained by updating players in reverse topological order of the forest branches ending at cycles, and finally resolving each cycle according to the chosen fixed point. ∎

Proposition B (Necessity within functional class for uniform guarantee). In functional digraphs, the condition “every directed cycle is sign-positive” is necessary for the existence of a PNE for all external fields h. More precisely, if some directed cycle C has ∏_{(i→j)∈C} sign(W_{ij})=−1, then for h=0 the game has no PNE.
Proof. With h=0 and w_i≠0 on C, best responses along C require x_{i_k}=sign(w_{i_k})·x_{i_{k+1}} for all k. Multiplying around C yields x_{i_1}=(∏ sign(w_{i_k}))·x_{i_1}=−x_{i_1}, impossible. Hence no PNE. ∎

Corollary C (DAGs). DAGs are functional with no cycles; Theorem A recovers the known guarantee: a PNE exists for all h, constructible by backward induction from sinks.

Row-sum consensus certificate
Lemma D (Row-sum consensus). If h_i + ∑_j W_{ij} ≥ 0 for all i, then x≡+1 is a PNE. If h_i + ∑_j W_{ij} ≤ 0 for all i, then x≡−1 is a PNE.
Proof. At x≡+1, the unilateral deviation payoff difference is u_i(+1,x_{−i})−u_i(−1,x_{−i})=2(h_i+∑_j W_{ij})≥0. Similarly for x≡−1. ∎
Remark. This is weight/bias dependent, not purely structural; it gives a fast certificate of existence of a strict PNE when inequalities are strict.

Examples
- Negative 3-cycle (functional, h=0): W_{12},W_{23},W_{31}<0. Directed cycle sign is (−1)^3=−1. By Proposition B, no PNE: indeed the equations force x_1=−x_2= x_3= −x_1.
- Positive 4-cycle (functional, h=0): let signs on edges be (+,+,−,−) in order, product +1. Then f_i are either identity or flip with an even number of flips; F_C=identity; two PNE on the cycle; arborescences propagate uniquely.
- Mixed biases (functional, some |h_i|≥|w_i|): nodes with strong bias become constant responders; F_C is constant hence has a fixed point regardless of edge signs; Theorem A still applies under the positive-cycle assumption, but even if a cycle were negative, sufficiently strong biases can create PNE; Proposition B shows only that a uniform guarantee over all h fails when a negative cycle exists.

Connections to existing results
- Structural balance on SCCs implies, after a gauge transformation, that all internal edges are nonnegative. In functional SCCs (simple directed cycles), “every directed cycle positive” is equivalent to SCC structural balance. Thus Theorem A refines the SCC composition pipeline by giving an explicit constructive proof in the functional case and shows necessity for uniform guarantees.
- The SCC composition theorem then implies: if every SCC of the dependency digraph is either undirected (exact potential) or functional with all directed cycles positive (hence universally PNE-admitting), the full game has a PNE for all h, constructible by reverse topological order.

Obstacles
- Extending the functional-cycle characterization to SCCs with outdegree > 1 is nontrivial: compositions become multivariate maps, and existence/necessity conditions are no longer captured by a single parity along cycles. Structural balance remains a sufficient condition, but necessity fails (there are non–structurally-balanced SCCs admitting PNE for some h, and even for all h under special symmetry/weight constraints).
- “Universally PNE-admitting SCCs” beyond undirected/structurally balanced remain to be characterized. Ordinal potentials on SCCs might suffice, but a clean graph-theoretic certificate is missing.

Next steps
- Prove a full characterization for universal PNE-admissibility in functional SCCs with additional incoming/outgoing arcs to other SCCs (the proof above essentially does this; formalize within the SCC composition theorem).
- Identify further SCC classes with universal PNE guarantee, e.g., exact/ordinal potential polymatrix blocks, or monotone (after switching) submodular/antitone components.
- Algorithmics: (i) detect functional components; (ii) check cycle sign in O(m) time; (iii) construct PNE by cycle resolution plus tree backpropagation; (iv) integrate into SCC pipeline. Provide pseudocode and worst-case complexity bounds in a later round.
- Explore necessary obstructions (e.g., negative directed cycles) beyond the functional class, and whether small forbidden-sign minors characterize non-universal SCCs.
