  "content": "Ideas\n- Add two constructive existence theorems beyond those already listed: (A) DAG dependency digraphs; (B) SCC-wise construction when every SCC is \u201cuniversally PNE-admitting\u201d (UPA), with undirected or structurally balanced SCCs as canonical UPA classes.\n- Characterize UPA for 2-node SCCs exactly; give a 3-cycle counterexample showing non-UPA.\n- Formalize BR-path concatenation across SCCs.\n\nModeling convention\n- Dependency arc i\u2192j iff W_{ij}\u22600. Player i\u2019s utility u_i(x)=h_i x_i + x_i\u2211_j W_{ij}x_j depends only on its out-neighbors {j: W_{ij}\u22600}.\n\nProposition 1 (DAGs guarantee a PNE and a BR-path)\nLet G=(V,E,W) be a directed acyclic dependency graph. For any h\u2208\u211d^V, the SNC game with x_i\u2208{\u00b11} admits a pure Nash equilibrium. Moreover, a finite BR-path to it exists.\nProof. Take a topological order v_1,\u2026,v_n with i\u2192j\u21d2i<j. Construct x by backward induction k=n,\u2026,1 setting\nx_{v_k}\u2208argmax_{a\u2208{\u00b11}} a( h_{v_k}+\u2211_{j>k} W_{v_k j} x_{v_j} ).\nSince all out-neighbors of v_k lie among {v_{k+1},\u2026,v_n}, later choices cannot change u_{v_k} once x_{v_k} is fixed. Hence, in the final profile, each v_k is a best responder. Updating players in the order n,n\u22121,\u2026,1 gives a BR-path. \u220e\n\nDefinition (UPA components)\nFor U\u2286V, the induced subgame on U is universally PNE-admitting (UPA) if for every f\u2208\u211d^U the restricted utilities u_i(y)=y_i(\u2211_{j\u2208U}W_{ij}y_j+f_i) admit a PNE on {\u00b11}^U.\nExamples.\n- Undirected W_{UU}=W_{UU}\u1d40: exact potential \u21d2 PNE for all f.\n- Structurally balanced U: \u2203\u03c3_U with [\u03c3_U]W_{UU}[\u03c3_U]\u22650 \u21d2 gauge to unsigned (supermodular) \u21d2 PNE for all f; map back preserves PNE.\n\nLemma 2 (Two-player UPA classification)\nConsider U={1,2} with weights a=W_{12}, b=W_{21}. The induced 2-player subgame is UPA iff ab\u22650.\nProof. For any f=(f_1,f_2), a profile (x_1,x_2) is a PNE iff\nx_1=sgn(a x_2 + f_1), x_2=sgn(b x_1 + f_2), with ties allowed. If ab\u22650, the four sign profiles cover \u211d^2 via the conditions\n(1,1): f_1\u2265\u2212a, f_2\u2265\u2212b; (\u22121,\u22121): f_1\u2264a, f_2\u2264b; (1,\u22121): f_1\u2265a, f_2\u2264\u2212b; (\u22121,1): f_1\u2264\u2212a, f_2\u2265b,\nso at least one PNE exists for every f. If ab<0, take f=(0,0): then (1,1) fails because one of \u2212b or \u2212a is positive; (\u22121,\u22121) fails symmetrically; (1,\u22121) requires f_1\u2265a (false if a>0) and f_2\u2264\u2212b (true if b<0), or vice versa; thus no PNE. Hence UPA \u21d4 ab\u22650. \u220e\n\nExample 3 (Non-UPA SCC: mixed-sign 3-cycle)\nLet 1\u21922 with W_{12}>0, 2\u21923 with W_{23}>0, 3\u21921 with W_{31}<0, h=0. Then the BR conditions reduce to x_1=x_2, x_2=x_3, x_3=\u2212x_1, which is impossible. Hence no PNE; this SCC is not UPA. (This matches \u201cnegative directed cycle\u201d obstruction.)\n\nTheorem 4 (SCC composition \u21d2 existence and BR-path)\nLet C_1,\u2026,C_m be the SCCs of G ordered so edges go only from C_k to C_\u2113 with k<\u2113 (condensation DAG). Assume each induced subgame on C_k is UPA. Then for any h\u2208\u211d^V the SNC game admits a PNE. Moreover, there is a finite BR-path to it.\nProof. Process SCCs in reverse topological order. For the sink C_m, define f^{(m)}:=h_{C_m} and pick x^*_{C_m} a PNE in C_m (possible by UPA). Suppose x^*_{C_{k+1}},\u2026,x^*_{C_m} fixed. For i\u2208C_k, u_i depends on x_{C_k} and an effective field f^{(k)}:=h_{C_k}+W_{C_k,>k} x^*_{>k}. Since C_k is UPA, pick a PNE x^*_{C_k} for the restricted game with field f^{(k)}. At the end, x^* is a PNE: for i\u2208C_k, all out-neighbors lie in C_k\u222a(>k), both frozen as when x^*_{C_k} was chosen. For the BR-path: concatenate within-component BR-paths C_m,C_{m\u22121},\u2026,C_1; each step is a BR in the full game because later components are already fixed and earlier ones do not affect u_i. \u220e\n\nCorollary 5 (Concrete UPA classes per SCC)\nIf every SCC is either undirected or structurally balanced, then the SNC game admits a PNE (and a BR-path). This strictly generalizes the global undirected/structurally balanced cases and includes DAGs (all SCCs are singletons).\n\nRemarks on scope and limits\n- The 2-node characterization shows UPA forbids \u201cmatching-pennies pairs\u201d (ab<0). Example 3 shows negative directed cycles obstruct UPA. For general SCCs, undirected or structurally balanced suffice; a full characterization of UPA SCCs beyond these remains open.\n- The BR-path we construct is explicit (by components). We do not claim convergence of arbitrary asynchronous BR; only existence of a path.\n\nExamples\n- DAG (new concrete): 1\u21922 (W_{12}=\u22123), 1\u21923 (2), 2\u21923 (1), h=(0,1,\u22122). Backward induction gives x=(\u22121,1,\u22121) a PNE; updating in order 3,2,1 yields a BR-path.\n- Mixed SCCs: C_1 undirected on {1,2,3}, C_2 structurally balanced on {4,5}, edges only from C_1 to C_2. Solve C_2 with f^{(2)}=h_{C_2}, then C_1 with f^{(1)}=h_{C_1}+W_{C_1,C_2}x^*_{C_2}; concatenate BR-paths.\n- 2-node SCC test: a=W_{12}=1, b=W_{21}=\u22121 \u21d2 ab<0, choose f=(0,0): no PNE (discoordination). If a=b=\u22121 \u21d2 ab>0: for any f there exists a PNE (by Lemma 2).\n\nObstacles\n- Necessary-and-sufficient UPA criteria for general SCCs are open. Negative directed cycles seem to obstruct, but extra edges can sometimes restore existence for some fields; UPA demands existence for all fields.\n\nNext steps\n- Characterize UPA SCCs via signed cycle constraints (e.g., every directed cycle positive up to a vertex signature) plus exact-potential exceptions (undirected blocks). Provide a polynomial-time checker combining (i) symmetry detection; (ii) structural balance check (gauge feasibility by 2-coloring the sign graph).\n- Integrate cohesive-core conditions: if an SCC is not UPA, but contains a cohesive unsigned/structurally balanced core R (as in the paper) and the remainder S is undirected/structurally balanced under freezing R, extend Theorem 4 to this compositional setting.\n- Document an algorithm: If DAG \u21d2 use Proposition 1; else SCC-decompose; if every SCC passes UPA test (undirected or structurally balanced), construct PNE by Theorem 4; otherwise, search for cohesive cores per the paper\u2019s criteria.\n\nVerified, testable claims\n- Proposition 1, Theorem 4: fully constructive proofs.\n- Lemma 2: exact two-player characterization.\n- Example 3: explicit no-PNE instance for a non-UPA SCC.\nThese can be added to proofs.md and used to expand output.md\u2019s graph classes guaranteeing PNE existence."
