Ideas
- Add two constructive existence theorems beyond those already listed: (A) DAG dependency digraphs; (B) SCC-wise construction when every SCC is “universally PNE-admitting” (UPA), with undirected or structurally balanced SCCs as canonical UPA classes.
- Characterize UPA for 2-node SCCs exactly; give a 3-cycle counterexample showing non-UPA.
- Formalize BR-path concatenation across SCCs.

Modeling convention
- Dependency arc i→j iff W_{ij}≠0. Player i’s utility u_i(x)=h_i x_i + x_i∑_j W_{ij}x_j depends only on its out-neighbors {j: W_{ij}≠0}.

Proposition 1 (DAGs guarantee a PNE and a BR-path)
Let G=(V,E,W) be a directed acyclic dependency graph. For any h∈ℝ^V, the SNC game with x_i∈{±1} admits a pure Nash equilibrium. Moreover, a finite BR-path to it exists.
Proof. Take a topological order v_1,…,v_n with i→j⇒i<j. Construct x by backward induction k=n,…,1 setting
x_{v_k}∈argmax_{a∈{±1}} a( h_{v_k}+∑_{j>k} W_{v_k j} x_{v_j} ).
Since all out-neighbors of v_k lie among {v_{k+1},…,v_n}, later choices cannot change u_{v_k} once x_{v_k} is fixed. Hence, in the final profile, each v_k is a best responder. Updating players in the order n,n−1,…,1 gives a BR-path. ∎

Definition (UPA components)
For U⊆V, the induced subgame on U is universally PNE-admitting (UPA) if for every f∈ℝ^U the restricted utilities u_i(y)=y_i(∑_{j∈U}W_{ij}y_j+f_i) admit a PNE on {±1}^U.
Examples.
- Undirected W_{UU}=W_{UU}ᵀ: exact potential ⇒ PNE for all f.
- Structurally balanced U: ∃σ_U with [σ_U]W_{UU}[σ_U]≥0 ⇒ gauge to unsigned (supermodular) ⇒ PNE for all f; map back preserves PNE.

Lemma 2 (Two-player UPA classification)
Consider U={1,2} with weights a=W_{12}, b=W_{21}. The induced 2-player subgame is UPA iff ab≥0.
Proof. For any f=(f_1,f_2), a profile (x_1,x_2) is a PNE iff
x_1=sgn(a x_2 + f_1), x_2=sgn(b x_1 + f_2), with ties allowed. If ab≥0, the four sign profiles cover ℝ^2 via the conditions
(1,1): f_1≥−a, f_2≥−b; (−1,−1): f_1≤a, f_2≤b; (1,−1): f_1≥a, f_2≤−b; (−1,1): f_1≤−a, f_2≥b,
so at least one PNE exists for every f. If ab<0, take f=(0,0): then (1,1) fails because one of −b or −a is positive; (−1,−1) fails symmetrically; (1,−1) requires f_1≥a (false if a>0) and f_2≤−b (true if b<0), or vice versa; thus no PNE. Hence UPA ⇔ ab≥0. ∎

Example 3 (Non-UPA SCC: mixed-sign 3-cycle)
Let 1→2 with W_{12}>0, 2→3 with W_{23}>0, 3→1 with W_{31}<0, h=0. Then the BR conditions reduce to x_1=x_2, x_2=x_3, x_3=−x_1, which is impossible. Hence no PNE; this SCC is not UPA. (This matches “negative directed cycle” obstruction.)

Theorem 4 (SCC composition ⇒ existence and BR-path)
Let C_1,…,C_m be the SCCs of G ordered so edges go only from C_k to C_ℓ with k<ℓ (condensation DAG). Assume each induced subgame on C_k is UPA. Then for any h∈ℝ^V the SNC game admits a PNE. Moreover, there is a finite BR-path to it.
Proof. Process SCCs in reverse topological order. For the sink C_m, define f^{(m)}:=h_{C_m} and pick x^*_{C_m} a PNE in C_m (possible by UPA). Suppose x^*_{C_{k+1}},…,x^*_{C_m} fixed. For i∈C_k, u_i depends on x_{C_k} and an effective field f^{(k)}:=h_{C_k}+W_{C_k,>k} x^*_{>k}. Since C_k is UPA, pick a PNE x^*_{C_k} for the restricted game with field f^{(k)}. At the end, x^* is a PNE: for i∈C_k, all out-neighbors lie in C_k∪(>k), both frozen as when x^*_{C_k} was chosen. For the BR-path: concatenate within-component BR-paths C_m,C_{m−1},…,C_1; each step is a BR in the full game because later components are already fixed and earlier ones do not affect u_i. ∎

Corollary 5 (Concrete UPA classes per SCC)
If every SCC is either undirected or structurally balanced, then the SNC game admits a PNE (and a BR-path). This strictly generalizes the global undirected/structurally balanced cases and includes DAGs (all SCCs are singletons).

Remarks on scope and limits
- The 2-node characterization shows UPA forbids “matching-pennies pairs” (ab<0). Example 3 shows negative directed cycles obstruct UPA. For general SCCs, undirected or structurally balanced suffice; a full characterization of UPA SCCs beyond these remains open.
- The BR-path we construct is explicit (by components). We do not claim convergence of arbitrary asynchronous BR; only existence of a path.

Examples
- DAG (new concrete): 1→2 (W_{12}=−3), 1→3 (2), 2→3 (1), h=(0,1,−2). Backward induction gives x=(−1,1,−1) a PNE; updating in order 3,2,1 yields a BR-path.
- Mixed SCCs: C_1 undirected on {1,2,3}, C_2 structurally balanced on {4,5}, edges only from C_1 to C_2. Solve C_2 with f^{(2)}=h_{C_2}, then C_1 with f^{(1)}=h_{C_1}+W_{C_1,C_2}x^*_{C_2}; concatenate BR-paths.
- 2-node SCC test: a=W_{12}=1, b=W_{21}=−1 ⇒ ab<0, choose f=(0,0): no PNE (discoordination). If a=b=−1 ⇒ ab>0: for any f there exists a PNE (by Lemma 2).

Obstacles
- Necessary-and-sufficient UPA criteria for general SCCs are open. Negative directed cycles seem to obstruct, but extra edges can sometimes restore existence for some fields; UPA demands existence for all fields.

Next steps
- Characterize UPA SCCs via signed cycle constraints (e.g., every directed cycle positive up to a vertex signature) plus exact-potential exceptions (undirected blocks). Provide a polynomial-time checker combining (i) symmetry detection; (ii) structural balance check (gauge feasibility by 2-coloring the sign graph).
- Integrate cohesive-core conditions: if an SCC is not UPA, but contains a cohesive unsigned/structurally balanced core R (as in the paper) and the remainder S is undirected/structurally balanced under freezing R, extend Theorem 4 to this compositional setting.
- Document an algorithm: If DAG ⇒ use Proposition 1; else SCC-decompose; if every SCC passes UPA test (undirected or structurally balanced), construct PNE by Theorem 4; otherwise, search for cohesive cores per the paper’s criteria.

Verified, testable claims
- Proposition 1, Theorem 4: fully constructive proofs.
- Lemma 2: exact two-player characterization.
- Example 3: explicit no-PNE instance for a non-UPA SCC.
These can be added to proofs.md and used to expand output.md’s graph classes guaranteeing PNE existence.
