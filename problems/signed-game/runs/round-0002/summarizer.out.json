  "summary_md": "This round identifies and constructs graph-level guarantees for pure Nash equilibria (PNE) in binary signed-network coordination (SNC) games. Main graph-level classification: a dependency digraph guarantees a PNE for every weight matrix W (zero diagonal on that digraph) and every bias h iff the digraph is acyclic (DAG) \u2014 sufficiency via backward induction, necessity via a directed cycle with inconsistent BR constraints (odd negative-product cycle). SCC composition: if every SCC is universally PNE-admitting under arbitrary external fields (examples: undirected SCCs or structurally balanced SCCs after a gauge), solve SCCs from sinks upward to build a global PNE and BR-path. Known guaranteed classes: undirected (exact-potential), unsigned (supermodular), structurally balanced (gauge \u2192 unsigned). Additional sufficient conditions: cohesive-core bounds (w_R + \u03c4\u00b7h \u2265 w_S), weight-dominance |h_i|>\u2211_j|W_ij|. Key obstructions: matching-pennies digons and all-negative directed 3-cycles. Draft algorithm: DAG check \u2192 SCC-decompose \u2192 per-SCC UPA test (symmetry/gauge) \u2192 cohesive-core checks \u2192 report obstructions.
