Strong convergence this round. All provers consistently use the dependency convention i→j iff W_ij≠0 (so u_i depends on out-neighbors). The central advance is a precise graph-level classification: a dependency digraph guarantees a PNE for all choices of W,h iff it is acyclic (DAG). Sufficiency is our known backward-induction construction; necessity is by isolating any directed cycle and choosing edge signs so the product is negative, forcing contradictory best-response constraints (no PNE when h=0). This is correct and important; I’ve promoted it to output.md with a rigorous proof.

SCC-wise composition remains sound: if each SCC is universally PNE-admitting under arbitrary external fields, we can build a global PNE by reverse topological order; undirected SCCs (exact potential) and structurally balanced SCCs (gauge to unsigned) are canonical examples. Prover 5’s two-player UPA classification (ab≥0) is correct and useful; I added a proof to proofs.md (the gauge-to-unsigned + supermodularity argument is simplest). Prover 2’s dominance lemmas give a clean obstruction (dominant negative cycle ⇒ no PNE) and a sufficient class (dominant positive cycles ⇒ two PNE on the cycle) — useful for diagnostics, though the positive-cycle case is already covered by structural balance. Prover 3’s “forest with sign-symmetric digons” and Prover 4’s “functional digraphs with positive cycles” sit within the structurally balanced/SCC pipeline (they’re valid and helpful subclasses, with necessity within the functional class).

Clarifications: (i) Structural balance herein is directed: W_ij≥0 within parts, W_ij≤0 across; equivalently ∃σ with [σ]W[σ]≥0. (ii) When citing BR-reachability for unsigned graphs, we rely on I-path reachability plus binary-action equivalence.

Next steps: (1) Characterize universally PNE-admitting SCCs beyond undirected/structurally balanced (potential polymatrix blocks, monotone transforms). (2) Provide a polynomial-time checker for UPA SCCs (cycle-parity after switching + exact/ordinal potentials). (3) Integrate dominance-based obstructions into a practical diagnostic pipeline. (4) Finalize an end-to-end algorithm: DAG check; else SCC decomposition; per-SCC test (symmetry/structural balance/functional-positive); construct PNE by reverse order; else attempt cohesive-core methods.
