  "feedback_md": "Strong convergence this round. All provers consistently use the dependency convention i\u2192j iff W_ij\u22600 (so u_i depends on out-neighbors). The central advance is a precise graph-level classification: a dependency digraph guarantees a PNE for all choices of W,h iff it is acyclic (DAG). Sufficiency is our known backward-induction construction; necessity is by isolating any directed cycle and choosing edge signs so the product is negative, forcing contradictory best-response constraints (no PNE when h=0). This is correct and important; I\u2019ve promoted it to output.md with a rigorous proof.\n\nSCC-wise composition remains sound: if each SCC is universally PNE-admitting under arbitrary external fields, we can build a global PNE by reverse topological order; undirected SCCs (exact potential) and structurally balanced SCCs (gauge to unsigned) are canonical examples. Prover 5\u2019s two-player UPA classification (ab\u22650) is correct and useful; I added a proof to proofs.md (the gauge-to-unsigned + supermodularity argument is simplest). Prover 2\u2019s dominance lemmas give a clean obstruction (dominant negative cycle \u21d2 no PNE) and a sufficient class (dominant positive cycles \u21d2 two PNE on the cycle) \u2014 useful for diagnostics, though the positive-cycle case is already covered by structural balance. Prover 3\u2019s \u201cforest with sign-symmetric digons\u201d and Prover 4\u2019s \u201cfunctional digraphs with positive cycles\u201d sit within the structurally balanced/SCC pipeline (they\u2019re valid and helpful subclasses, with necessity within the functional class).\n\nClarifications: (i) Structural balance herein is directed: W_ij\u22650 within parts, W_ij\u22640 across; equivalently \u2203\u03c3 with [\u03c3]W[\u03c3]\u22650. (ii) When citing BR-reachability for unsigned graphs, we rely on I-path reachability plus binary-action equivalence.\n\nNext steps: (1) Characterize universally PNE-admitting SCCs beyond undirected/structurally balanced (potential polymatrix blocks, monotone transforms). (2) Provide a polynomial-time checker for UPA SCCs (cycle-parity after switching + exact/ordinal potentials). (3) Integrate dominance-based obstructions into a practical diagnostic pipeline. (4) Finalize an end-to-end algorithm: DAG check; else SCC decomposition; per-SCC test (symmetry/structural balance/functional-positive); construct PNE by reverse order; else attempt cohesive-core methods.",

The following are equivalent:\n(i) For every weight matrix W with zero diagonal supported on E and every h\u2208\u211d^V, the SNC game u_i(x)=h_i x_i + x_i\u2211_j W_{ij} x_j admits a pure Nash equilibrium.\n(ii) G is acyclic (a DAG).\nProof. (ii\u21d2i) Topologically order v_1,\u2026,v_n so i\u2192j implies i<j. Construct x by backward induction k=n,\u2026,1, setting x_{v_k}\u2208argmax_{a\u2208{\u00b11}} a(h_{v_k}+\u2211_{j>k}W_{v_k j}x_{v_j}). Each u_{v_k} depends only on already fixed out-neighbors, hence x is a PNE.\n(i\u21d2ii) Suppose G has a directed cycle C=(i_1\u2192\u2026\u2192i_k\u2192i_1). Choose h=0 and set all off-cycle weights to 0. On C, choose nonzero W so that the product of edge signs \u220f_{\u2113=1}^k sgn(W_{i_\u2113,i_{\u2113+1}}) = \u22121 (e.g., choose an odd number of negative edges). For any profile x, a best response at i_\u2113 requires x_{i_\u2113}=sgn(W_{i_\u2113,i_{\u2113+1}}) x_{i_{\u2113+1}}. Any PNE would satisfy all k constraints, whose product yields x_{i_1}=(\u220f sgn) x_{i_1}=\u2212x_{i_1}, impossible. Hence there exist W,h with no PNE, contradicting (i). \u220e\n\nProposition (Two-player UPA classification).\nLet U={1,2} and consider the induced subgame with weights a=W_{12}, b=W_{21}. The subgame on U admits a PNE for every external field f\u2208\u211d^U iff ab\u22650.\nProof. If ab\u22650 and at least one of a,b is zero, one player\u2019s utility is independent of the other\u2019s action; the other has a linear term; a PNE exists for all f. If a,b>0, the 2-player game is supermodular (unsigned) and thus has a PNE for all f. If a,b<0, apply \u03c3=(1,\u22121) to make both off-diagonals nonnegative; by gauge equivalence, the transformed unsigned game has a PNE for all f, and mapping back preserves PNE. Conversely, if ab<0, with f=(0,0) the subgame is the 2-player discoordination (matching pennies) and has no PNE. Hence UPA \u21d4 ab\u22650. \u220e"

If acyclic, a PNE exists by backward induction along a topological order (item 1). Conversely, if there is a directed cycle C, choose h=0 and put nonzero weights only on C with an odd number of negative signs so that the product of edge signs is \u22121. Then the best-response constraints along C force x_i = s_i x_{succ(i)} with \u220f s_i = \u22121, which is inconsistent, so no PNE exists. Hence only DAGs provide a uniform guarantee over all W,h."
