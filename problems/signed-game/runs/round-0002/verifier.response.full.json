The claim is that there exist weights and heights such that no pure Nash equilibrium (PNE) exists. That makes sense since I can set only the cycle edges to non-zero and choose the signs to ensure the product equals -1. Ensuring the product equals -1 for any cycle length seems possible by selecting an odd number of negative edges. Dominance requirements may not hold if we restrict to a single out-neighbor per node, as each node has out-degree 1 in a simple cycle.",

It seems I need to compute \\(u_i\\) based on how \\(x_i\\) and \\(x_{i+1}\\) interact through weights. Setting \\(h=0\\) suggests that the best response set can only occur if \\(W\\) is nonzero. The challenge arises with multiplying the signs; if the product equals -1, it's impossible unless \\(x_{i_1}\\) is zero, which isn't allowed. This implies no pure Nash equilibrium exists when there are directed cycles, confirming that a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is necessary for PNE to hold for all weights and heights.",

This makes sense because in a forest, there are no simple undirected cycles, but directed cycles could exist due to digons. However, since the underlying graph is a forest, any directed cycle must involve both arcs of the same undirected edge. Therefore, the only possible strongly connected components are singletons or 2-node pairs with both arcs, which is a clear conclusion.",
