Key advance: exact graph-level classification — a dependency digraph guarantees a PNE for all W,h iff it is a DAG (necessity via a negative-sign directed cycle obstruction; sufficiency via backward induction). We retain SCC composition: if each SCC is universally PNE-admitting under arbitrary external fields (e.g., undirected or structurally balanced), a global PNE exists with a BR-path. Added two-player UPA classification (same-sign digon), and noted cycle-dominance obstruction/sufficient cases for diagnostics. Output.md updated with the DAG equivalence; proofs.md augmented with full proofs. Next: characterize universally PNE-admitting SCCs beyond current classes and design a polynomial checker.
