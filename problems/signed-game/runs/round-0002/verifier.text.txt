{"feedback_md":"Strong convergence this round. All provers consistently use the dependency convention i→j iff W_ij≠0 (so u_i depends on out-neighbors). The central advance is a precise graph-level classification: a dependency digraph guarantees a PNE for all choices of W,h iff it is acyclic (DAG). Sufficiency is our known backward-induction construction; necessity is by isolating any directed cycle and choosing edge signs so the product is negative, forcing contradictory best-response constraints (no PNE when h=0). This is correct and important; I’ve promoted it to output.md with a rigorous proof.\n\nSCC-wise composition remains sound: if each SCC is universally PNE-admitting under arbitrary external fields, we can build a global PNE by reverse topological order; undirected SCCs (exact potential) and structurally balanced SCCs (gauge to unsigned) are canonical examples. Prover 5’s two-player UPA classification (ab≥0) is correct and useful; I added a proof to proofs.md (the gauge-to-unsigned + supermodularity argument is simplest). Prover 2’s dominance lemmas give a clean obstruction (dominant negative cycle ⇒ no PNE) and a sufficient class (dominant positive cycles ⇒ two PNE on the cycle) — useful for diagnostics, though the positive-cycle case is already covered by structural balance. Prover 3’s “forest with sign-symmetric digons” and Prover 4’s “functional digraphs with positive cycles” sit within the structurally balanced/SCC pipeline (they’re valid and helpful subclasses, with necessity within the functional class).\n\nClarifications: (i) Structural balance herein is directed: W_ij≥0 within parts, W_ij≤0 across; equivalently ∃σ with [σ]W[σ]≥0. (ii) When citing BR-reachability for unsigned graphs, we rely on I-path reachability plus binary-action equivalence.\n\nNext steps: (1) Characterize universally PNE-admitting SCCs beyond undirected/structurally balanced (potential polymatrix blocks, monotone transforms). (2) Provide a polynomial-time checker for UPA SCCs (cycle-parity after switching + exact/ordinal potentials). (3) Integrate dominance-based obstructions into a practical diagnostic pipeline. (4) Finalize an end-to-end algorithm: DAG check; else SCC decomposition; per-SCC test (symmetry/structural balance/functional-positive); construct PNE by reverse order; else attempt cohesive-core methods.","summary_md":"Key advance: exact graph-level classification — a dependency digraph guarantees a PNE for all W,h iff it is a DAG (necessity via a negative-sign directed cycle obstruction; sufficiency via backward induction).

The following are equivalent:\n(i) For every weight matrix W with zero diagonal supported on E and every h∈ℝ^V, the SNC game u_i(x)=h_i x_i + x_i∑_j W_{ij} x_j admits a pure Nash equilibrium.\n(ii) G is acyclic (a DAG).\nProof. (ii⇒i) Topologically order v_1,…,v_n so i→j implies i<j. Construct x by backward induction k=n,…,1, setting x_{v_k}∈argmax_{a∈{±1}} a(h_{v_k}+∑_{j>k}W_{v_k j}x_{v_j}). Each u_{v_k} depends only on already fixed out-neighbors, hence x is a PNE.\n(i⇒ii) Suppose G has a directed cycle C=(i_1→…→i_k→i_1). Choose h=0 and set all off-cycle weights to 0. On C, choose nonzero W so that the product of edge signs ∏_{ℓ=1}^k sgn(W_{i_ℓ,i_{ℓ+1}}) = −1 (e.g., choose an odd number of negative edges). For any profile x, a best response at i_ℓ requires x_{i_ℓ}=sgn(W_{i_ℓ,i_{ℓ+1}}) x_{i_{ℓ+1}}. Any PNE would satisfy all k constraints, whose product yields x_{i_1}=(∏ sgn) x_{i_1}=−x_{i_1}, impossible. Hence there exist W,h with no PNE, contradicting (i). ∎\n\nProposition (Two-player UPA classification).\nLet U={1,2} and consider the induced subgame with weights a=W_{12}, b=W_{21}. The subgame on U admits a PNE for every external field f∈ℝ^U iff ab≥0.\nProof. If ab≥0 and at least one of a,b is zero, one player’s utility is independent of the other’s action; the other has a linear term; a PNE exists for all f. If a,b>0, the 2-player game is supermodular (unsigned) and thus has a PNE for all f. If a,b<0, apply σ=(1,−1) to make both off-diagonals nonnegative; by gauge equivalence, the transformed unsigned game has a PNE for all f, and mapping back preserves PNE. Conversely, if ab<0, with f=(0,0) the subgame is the 2-player discoordination (matching pennies) and has no PNE. Hence UPA ⇔ ab≥0. ∎"},"output_update":{"action":"append","content":"3) Graph-level classification (uniform guarantee)\nTheorem (Uniform guarantee ⇔ DAG). A dependency digraph guarantees a PNE for every real weight matrix W (zero diagonal, supported on the digraph) and every bias vector h∈ℝ^V if and only if it is acyclic (a DAG).\nProof. If acyclic, a PNE exists by backward induction along a topological order (item 1). Conversely, if there is a directed cycle C, choose h=0 and put nonzero weights only on C with an odd number of negative signs so that the product of edge signs is −1. Then the best-response constraints along C force x_i = s_i x_{succ(i)} with ∏ s_i = −1, which is inconsistent, so no PNE exists. Hence only DAGs provide a uniform guarantee over all W,h."}}
