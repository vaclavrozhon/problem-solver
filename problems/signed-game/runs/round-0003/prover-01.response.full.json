          "text": "{\"content\":\"Ideas\\n- Strengthen the graph-level guarantees by classifying functional digraphs (outdegree \u2264 1). Their SCCs are directed cycles or singletons. We prove that such a graph guarantees a PNE for every external field h if and only if every directed cycle has positive sign product. This yields a linear-time recognizer and a constructive PNE.\\n- Isolate and prove the single-cycle criterion (universally PNE-admitting iff positive sign product), then lift to functional digraphs via SCC composition (reverse topological order), using that singletons are trivial and cycles become unsigned under an admissible gauge.\\n- Provide small diagnostic examples and connect to the paper\u2019s robust obstructions (odd negative cycles) and to structural balance of SCCs.\\n\\nSingle directed cycle: universal PNE criterion\\nSetup: Players on a directed simple cycle C = (1\u21922\u2192\u2026\u2192k\u21921), weights W_{i,i+1} \u2260 0 on cycle edges only (indices cyclic), all other W_{ij}=0, external field f \u2208 R^C arbitrary. Utilities: u_i(x)=x_i(f_i+W_{i,i+1}x_{i+1}).\\nLemma (cycle UPA \u21d4 positive sign product). The subgame on C admits a PNE for every external field f if and only if \u220f_{i=1}^k sgn(W_{i,i+1}) = +1.\\nProof.\\n(\u21d2) Necessity. If \u220f sgn(W_{i,i+1}) = \u22121, set f=0 and scale |W_{i,i+1}| large. Best responses force x_i = \u2212sgn(W_{i,i+1}) x_{i+1}. Multiplying all k constraints yields 1 = \u220f(\u2212sgn W_{i,i+1}) = \u22121, impossible. Hence for this W,f no PNE exists, contradicting universal existence.\\n(\u21d0) Sufficiency. If \u220f sgn(W_{i,i+1}) = +1, there exists \u03c3 \u2208 {\u00b11}^C solving \u03c3_i \u03c3_{i+1} = sgn(W_{i,i+1}) for all i. Then [\u03c3]W[\u03c3] has nonnegative cycle weights: W^{[\u03c3]}_{i,i+1} = |W_{i,i+1}|. The transformed subgame is unsigned, hence supermodular; for any external field f^{[\u03c3]} = [\u03c3]f it admits a PNE. Mapping back via x = [\u03c3]y preserves best responses (Lemma NashGauge). Thus the original cycle has a PNE for every f. \u220e\\n\\nFunctional digraphs (outdegree \u2264 1): uniform guarantee\\nDefinition. A functional digraph has outdeg(i) \u2264 1 for all i. Its SCCs are either (i) singletons, or (ii) directed cycles; the condensation is a DAG whose sinks are the cycles.\\nTheorem (functional digraphs: uniform guarantee \u21d4 all cycles positive). Let G be a functional digraph. For any real weights W supported on G (zero diagonal) and any h \u2208 R^V, the SNC game admits a PNE for every h if and only if every directed cycle C in G satisfies \u220f_{e\u2208C} sgn(W_e) = +1.\\nProof.\\n(\u21d0) Sufficiency. Decompose into SCCs; cycles are sinks. For each cycle C, by the Lemma, the C-subgame is universally PNE-admitting (UPA) for all external fields. Singletons are trivially UPA. Process SCCs in reverse topological order: fix a PNE on each sink cycle (exists for any external field), then treat predecessors whose external fields are now fixed, and so on. By the SCC composition theorem (notes/output), concatenation of per-SCC PNEs yields a global PNE. Since cycles were UPA, this holds for every h.\\n(\u21d2) Necessity. If some cycle C has negative sign product, then by the Lemma choose h supported on C (e.g., h_C=0) witnessing nonexistence of a PNE in the C-subgame. Setting all other weights from C to outside zero makes the C-subgame independent; thus the full game has no PNE for that h. Hence universal guarantee fails. \u220e\\n\\nAlgorithmic consequences\\n- Recognition and construction in O(|V|+|E|): detect cycles in functional digraph; check sign product per cycle; if all positive, build a PNE by (a) gauging each cycle to unsigned, compute a PNE (e.g., Tarski iteration), (b) then assign predecessors greedily (singletons) in reverse topological order.\\n\\nExamples\\n- 3-cycle: 1\u21922\u21923\u21921. If sgn(W_{12}W_{23}W_{31})=+1, then for any h there is a PNE (gauge to unsigned). If negative, h=0 and dominant edges yield no PNE (contradiction constraints).\\n- Two disjoint cycles with incoming trees: PNE exists for all h iff each cycle\u2019s sign product is positive; the trees\u2019 nodes play best responses given cycle states.\\n\\nRelation to structural balance\\n- On a single cycle, \u201cpositive sign product\u201d is precisely the cycle-balance condition; equivalently, \u2203\u03c3 with [\u03c3]W[\u03c3] nonnegative on the cycle. Thus the theorem fits the SCC structural-balance criterion in this special class.\\n\\nObstacles\\n- Beyond functional digraphs, SCCs may be complex. A full UPA classification remains open; necessary obstructions include odd-negative signed cycles (Lemma 3 in prior rounds). Exact-potential SCCs (symmetric W_{UU}) and unsigned-after-gauge SCCs are UPA; identifying further UPA families is a key next step.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Extend UPA tests to general SCCs via parity constraints on all directed cycles (switching to test unsignedness) and explore additional potential structures (exact/ordinal potentials, polymatrix decomposability).\\n- Integrate the functional-digraph classifier into the SCC pipeline: cycles positive \u21d2 yes; else attempt cohesive-core criteria across SCCs to still ensure PNE in mixed graphs.\\n\"}",
