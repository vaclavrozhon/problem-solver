We also give a linear-time structural-balance checker compatible with our directed convention (i\u2192j iff W_{ij}\u22600). These are incremental and testable.\n\nLemma A (2-node SCC: UPA classification)\nLet U={1,2} with W_{11}=W_{22}=0 and both W_{12},W_{21} possibly nonzero. The induced subgame on U is universally PNE-admitting (for every external field f\u2208\u211d^U) iff sgn(W_{12})\u00b7sgn(W_{21})\u22650 (including the zero cases).\nProof.\n(\u21d2) Suppose sgn(W_{12}) and sgn(W_{21}) have the same sign or one is zero. Choose \u03c3=(1, \u03c4) with \u03c4=sgn(W_{12}) if W_{12}\u22600 else \u03c4=1. Then [\u03c3]W_{UU}[\u03c3] has entries W\u2019_{12}=|W_{12}|\u22650 and W\u2019_{21}=\u03c4 W_{21} \u03c4=sgn(W_{12})^2\u00b7|W_{21}| if W_{21}\u22600, hence W\u2019_{UU}\u22650. The gauged subgame has nonnegative weights, so it is supermodular; for any external field f\u2019=[\u03c3]f it admits a PNE. Mapping back by x=[\u03c3]y preserves PNE (Lemma in the paper), so the original subgame is UPA.\n(\u21d0) If sgn(W_{12})\u00b7sgn(W_{21})<0, set f=0 and take only these two arcs nonzero. The resulting two-player game is matching pennies (Example: discoordination digon), which has no PNE. Hence not UPA. \u220e\n\nTheorem B (Simple directed cycle SCC: UPA \u21d4 even negativity)\nLet U={i_1,\u2026,i_k} form a directed simple cycle i_r\u2192i_{r+1} (indices mod k), with W_{i_r,i_{r+1}}\u22600 and no other nonzero W_{ij} inside U. The induced subgame on U is universally PNE-admitting iff the cycle has an even number of negative arcs, i.e., \u220f_{r=1}^k sgn(W_{i_r,i_{r+1}})=+1.\nProof.\n(\u21d2 sufficiency) If the sign product is +1, there exists \u03c3\u2208{\u00b11}^U such that [\u03c3]W_{UU}[\u03c3]\u22650 (make each cycle edge nonnegative by alternating sign switches; consistency is guaranteed precisely by even negativity). The gauged subgame is unsigned (Metzler), hence supermodular, thus a PNE exists for every external field f\u2019=[\u03c3]f. Mapping back gives a PNE for any f, so U is UPA.\n(\u21d0 necessity) If the sign product is \u22121, set f=0. Each i_r has a single out-neighbor i_{r+1}, so u_{i_r}(x)=x_{i_r}W_{i_r,i_{r+1}}x_{i_{r+1}} and the best response forces x_{i_r}=sgn(W_{i_r,i_{r+1}})x_{i_{r+1}}. Chaining around the cycle yields x_{i_1}=(\u220f sgn) x_{i_1}=\u2212x_{i_1}, a contradiction. Hence no PNE for this f, so not UPA. \u220e\n\nProposition C (Directed structural balance: linear-time check)\nGiven a directed signed graph on U, there exists \u03c3\u2208{\u00b11}^U with [\u03c3]W_{UU}[\u03c3]\u22650 iff for every undirected cycle in the support (merge parallel arcs into a single undirected edge whose required sign equals the common sign if both directions exist, else the sign of the existent arc), the product of edge signs is +1 (no negative signed cycle). This can be decided by 2-coloring/sign-propagation in O(|U|+|E_U|).\nSketch.\nConstraints are \u03c3_i \u03c3_j = sgn(W_{ij}) for every arc i\u2192j. If both directions exist, consistency requires sgn(W_{ij})=sgn(W_{ji}). Collapsing to a single signed undirected edge per pair, solvability is the classic signed-graph balance condition (no negative cycle), checkable by BFS with parity labels.\n\nExamples\n- 2-node SCC with W_{12}=2, W_{21}=\u22121 fails UPA by Lemma A; f=0 gives no PNE.\n- 4-cycle with signs (+,\u2212,\u2212,+) is UPA by Theorem B; after gauge all edges are nonnegative; supermodularity gives a PNE for every f.\n\nObstacles\n- Theorem B assumes the SCC is exactly a simple cycle (outdegree=indegree=1 inside U). For general SCCs with additional chords, necessity via a negative cycle can fail without a dominance margin; non-UPA may still hold but requires weight-specific arguments.\n\nNext steps\n- Extend UPA classification to chorded cycles: sufficient conditions via [\u03c3]W[\u03c3]\u22650 (structural balance), necessary obstructions via embedded negative directed cycles plus degree constraints (or dominance margins).\n- Integrate Proposition C into an SCC pipeline: per SCC test (i) undirected, (ii) structurally balanced by \u03c3-switching, (iii) simple-cycle parity (Theorem B), (iv) 2-node digon criterion (Lemma A). If all SCCs pass, build a global PNE by reverse topological order.\n- Explore sharper necessary conditions using Pfaffian/sign constraints or discrete fixed-point arguments for polymatrix games on SCCs beyond balanced cases.\n\nAppendix: Strict bias dominance (for completeness)\nClaim. If |h_i|>\u2211_j|W_{ij}| \u2200i, then x_i=sgn(h_i) is a strict PNE.\nProof. For any i, x_i(h_i+\u2211_j W_{ij}x_j) \u2265 |h_i| \u2212 \u2211_j|W_{ij}| > 0, so flipping x_i strictly reduces u_i. \u220e"
