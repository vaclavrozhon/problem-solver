Ideas
We refine the catalogue of graph classes guaranteeing pure Nash equilibria (PNE) by classifying universally PNE-admitting (UPA) strongly connected components (SCCs) in two fundamental cases: 2-node SCCs and simple directed cycle SCCs. We also give a linear-time structural-balance checker compatible with our directed convention (i→j iff W_{ij}≠0). These are incremental and testable.

Lemma A (2-node SCC: UPA classification)
Let U={1,2} with W_{11}=W_{22}=0 and both W_{12},W_{21} possibly nonzero. The induced subgame on U is universally PNE-admitting (for every external field f∈ℝ^U) iff sgn(W_{12})·sgn(W_{21})≥0 (including the zero cases).
Proof.
(⇒) Suppose sgn(W_{12}) and sgn(W_{21}) have the same sign or one is zero. Choose σ=(1, τ) with τ=sgn(W_{12}) if W_{12}≠0 else τ=1. Then [σ]W_{UU}[σ] has entries W’_{12}=|W_{12}|≥0 and W’_{21}=τ W_{21} τ=sgn(W_{12})^2·|W_{21}| if W_{21}≠0, hence W’_{UU}≥0. The gauged subgame has nonnegative weights, so it is supermodular; for any external field f’=[σ]f it admits a PNE. Mapping back by x=[σ]y preserves PNE (Lemma in the paper), so the original subgame is UPA.
(⇐) If sgn(W_{12})·sgn(W_{21})<0, set f=0 and take only these two arcs nonzero. The resulting two-player game is matching pennies (Example: discoordination digon), which has no PNE. Hence not UPA. ∎

Theorem B (Simple directed cycle SCC: UPA ⇔ even negativity)
Let U={i_1,…,i_k} form a directed simple cycle i_r→i_{r+1} (indices mod k), with W_{i_r,i_{r+1}}≠0 and no other nonzero W_{ij} inside U. The induced subgame on U is universally PNE-admitting iff the cycle has an even number of negative arcs, i.e., ∏_{r=1}^k sgn(W_{i_r,i_{r+1}})=+1.
Proof.
(⇒ sufficiency) If the sign product is +1, there exists σ∈{±1}^U such that [σ]W_{UU}[σ]≥0 (make each cycle edge nonnegative by alternating sign switches; consistency is guaranteed precisely by even negativity). The gauged subgame is unsigned (Metzler), hence supermodular, thus a PNE exists for every external field f’=[σ]f. Mapping back gives a PNE for any f, so U is UPA.
(⇐ necessity) If the sign product is −1, set f=0. Each i_r has a single out-neighbor i_{r+1}, so u_{i_r}(x)=x_{i_r}W_{i_r,i_{r+1}}x_{i_{r+1}} and the best response forces x_{i_r}=sgn(W_{i_r,i_{r+1}})x_{i_{r+1}}. Chaining around the cycle yields x_{i_1}=(∏ sgn) x_{i_1}=−x_{i_1}, a contradiction. Hence no PNE for this f, so not UPA. ∎

Proposition C (Directed structural balance: linear-time check)
Given a directed signed graph on U, there exists σ∈{±1}^U with [σ]W_{UU}[σ]≥0 iff for every undirected cycle in the support (merge parallel arcs into a single undirected edge whose required sign equals the common sign if both directions exist, else the sign of the existent arc), the product of edge signs is +1 (no negative signed cycle). This can be decided by 2-coloring/sign-propagation in O(|U|+|E_U|).
Sketch.
Constraints are σ_i σ_j = sgn(W_{ij}) for every arc i→j. If both directions exist, consistency requires sgn(W_{ij})=sgn(W_{ji}). Collapsing to a single signed undirected edge per pair, solvability is the classic signed-graph balance condition (no negative cycle), checkable by BFS with parity labels.

Examples
- 2-node SCC with W_{12}=2, W_{21}=−1 fails UPA by Lemma A; f=0 gives no PNE.
- 4-cycle with signs (+,−,−,+) is UPA by Theorem B; after gauge all edges are nonnegative; supermodularity gives a PNE for every f.

Obstacles
- Theorem B assumes the SCC is exactly a simple cycle (outdegree=indegree=1 inside U). For general SCCs with additional chords, necessity via a negative cycle can fail without a dominance margin; non-UPA may still hold but requires weight-specific arguments.

Next steps
- Extend UPA classification to chorded cycles: sufficient conditions via [σ]W[σ]≥0 (structural balance), necessary obstructions via embedded negative directed cycles plus degree constraints (or dominance margins).
- Integrate Proposition C into an SCC pipeline: per SCC test (i) undirected, (ii) structurally balanced by σ-switching, (iii) simple-cycle parity (Theorem B), (iv) 2-node digon criterion (Lemma A). If all SCCs pass, build a global PNE by reverse topological order.
- Explore sharper necessary conditions using Pfaffian/sign constraints or discrete fixed-point arguments for polymatrix games on SCCs beyond balanced cases.

Appendix: Strict bias dominance (for completeness)
Claim. If |h_i|>∑_j|W_{ij}| ∀i, then x_i=sgn(h_i) is a strict PNE.
Proof. For any i, x_i(h_i+∑_j W_{ij}x_j) ≥ |h_i| − ∑_j|W_{ij}| > 0, so flipping x_i strictly reduces u_i. ∎
