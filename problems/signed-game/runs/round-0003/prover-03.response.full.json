The user's previous messages indicate that we've already covered \"Main Results,\" like DAG \u21d2 PNE and SCC composition. Feedback suggests this is sound. Now, I want to make incremental progress in this round by introducing new lemmas, proofs, examples, or refining necessary conditions. I\u2019ll also look for universal PNE-admitting SCCs. The \"Notes\" section will include claimed contributions, like our 2-player UPA classification and dominance lemmas.",

First, for the 2-node SCC UPA characterization, if the signs match, it's UPA. However, if the signs are opposite and zero biases are allowed, I need to show that a particular external field leads to the absence of a PNE. I\u2019ll choose specific weights and biases to validate this. \n\nSecond, for a broader SCC characterization of UPA, I want to assert that achieving UPA hinges on structural balance and gauge transformation. I need to ensure this fits every external field scenario, exploring if other UPA cases exist.",

Undirected connections might not be necessary if the structure is balanced, but what about configurations with bipartite positive and negative factors? If the setup isn't structurally balanced, it leads to a negative-sign directed cycle. \n\nI can show that if this happens, no PNE exists.

Structural balance does allow for negative edges, but I wonder about symmetric graphs that don't fit that balance. If a symmetric weight matrix has mixed signs, it may still allow for a PNE, regardless of external fields. \n\nI need to consider whether undirected symmetric graphs are always structurally balanced. For example, a triangle with one negative edge and two positive edges indicates that it can\u2019t be balanced since the cycle's product is negative.

It seems there\u2019s a pathway to propose that if a negative-sign directed cycle exists, then a UPA can fail.

We focus on small, auditable modules that slot into the SCC composition pipeline.\\n\\n- New contributions: (i) weight-dominance \u21d2 strict PNE; (ii) 2-player SCCs are universally PNE-admitting (UPA) iff the two off-diagonal entries have the same sign; (iii) forests with sign-symmetric digons \u21d2 PNE (via SCC composition); (iv) UPA classification for functional SCCs (outdegree 1 inside SCC): UPA iff every directed cycle has positive sign; (v) structural-balance cycle-parity check in SCCs; (vi) bias-dominates-frustration certificate for a targeted profile.\\n\\nLemmas and theorems (with proofs)\\n\\nLemma (Weight-dominance \u21d2 strict PNE). If for all i, |h_i|>\u2211_j |W_{ij}|, then x^* with x^*_i=sgn(h_i) is a strict PNE.\\nProof. For fixed x^*_{\u2212i}, u_i(x)=x_i(h_i+\u2211_j W_{ij}x_j). Then x^*_i(h_i+\u2211_j W_{ij}x_j)\u2265|h_i|\u2212\u2211_j |W_{ij}|>0, so flipping i strictly decreases u_i. Hence x^* is strict.\\n\\nLemma (Two-player SCC UPA iff same-sign digon). Let U={1,2}, W_{11}=W_{22}=0. The subgame on U is UPA (PNE exists for every external f\u2208R^U) iff W_{12}W_{21}\u22650.\\nProof. If W_{12}W_{21}\u22650, pick \u03c3 with \u03c3_1=1, \u03c3_2=sgn(W_{12}). Then [\u03c3]W_{UU}[\u03c3] has nonnegative off-diagonals; the 2-player subgame is unsigned (supermodular), hence admits a PNE for all f. Conversely, if W_{12}W_{21}<0, take f=0. Best responses are x_1=sgn(W_{12}x_2), x_2=sgn(W_{21}x_1), i.e., x_1=s_{12}x_2, x_2=s_{21}x_1 with s_{ij}=sgn(W_{ij}). Composition yields x_1=(s_{12}s_{21})x_1, impossible since s_{12}s_{21}=-1. Hence not UPA.\\n\\nTheorem (Forests with sign-symmetric digons \u21d2 PNE). If the underlying undirected graph is a forest and every digon {i,j} with both directions present has sgn(W_{ij})=sgn(W_{ji}), then for any W,h the game admits a PNE.\\nProof. In a forest, each SCC is either a singleton or a 2-node digon. Singletons are trivially UPA. A sign-symmetric digon is UPA by the 2-player lemma. The condensation is acyclic; by SCC composition (solve sink to source, treating downstream as external fields), a global PNE exists.\\n\\nTheorem (Functional SCC UPA \u21d4 all directed cycles positive). Let U be an SCC where each i\u2208U has exactly one out-neighbor in U. Then the subgame on U is UPA iff every directed cycle in U has positive sign product \u220f_{(i\u2192j)\u2208C} sgn(W_{ij})=+1.\\nProof (\u21d2). If some directed cycle C has negative sign product, set f=0. For each i on C, u_i depends only on x_{succ(i)} with coefficient W_{i,succ(i)}. Best response is unique: x_i=sgn(W_{i,succ(i)} x_{succ(i)}). Composing along C yields x_i=(-)x_i, impossible. Thus no PNE for this f; not UPA.\\n(\u21d0). If all cycles are positive, define \u03c3 by fixing r\u2208U with \u03c3_r=1; for any v, let \u03c3_v be the product of sgn(W_{ij}) along any directed path r\u2192\u2026\u2192v. Cycle-positivity implies path-independence. Then [\u03c3]W_{UU}[\u03c3] has nonnegative entries (each unique out-arc in U becomes nonnegative), so the subgame is unsigned; supermodular games admit a PNE for all external f. Hence UPA.\\n\\nProposition (Structural-balance cycle parity on SCCs). For a strongly connected U, the following are equivalent: (i) \u2203\u03c3 with [\u03c3]W_{UU}[\u03c3]\u22650; (ii) every directed cycle in U has positive sign product. Proof. (i)\u21d2(ii) by multiplying signs along the cycle; (ii)\u21d2(i) by the path-product construction above. This yields an O(|U|+|E(U)|) checker.\\n\\nLemma (Bias-dominates-frustration certificate). For \u03c3\u2208{\u00b11}^V, define L_i(\u03c3)=\u03c3_i(h_i+\u2211_j W_{ij}\u03c3_j). If L_i(\u03c3)>0 for all i, then \u03c3 is a strict PNE. A sufficient bound: L_i(\u03c3) \u2265 \u03c3_i h_i + \u2211_{j: sgn(W_{ij})=\u03c3_i\u03c3_j} |W_{ij}| \u2212 \u2211_{j: sgn(W_{ij})\u2260\u03c3_i\u03c3_j} |W_{ij}|. If the RHS is >0 for all i, \u03c3 is a strict PNE.\\n\\nTheorem (Uniform guarantee \u21d4 DAG). A dependency digraph G guarantees a PNE for every real W supported on G (zero diagonal) and every h iff G is acyclic.\\nProof. If acyclic, PNE exists by backward induction along a topological order (constructive BR-path). If G has a directed cycle C, pick h=0 and W nonzero only on C with edge signs having negative product. Then each player on C has a unique best response x_i=sgn(W_{i,succ(i)}x_{succ(i)}), yielding a contradiction. Hence only DAGs guarantee uniformly.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\n- Sign-asymmetric digon: W_{12}=1, W_{21}=-1, h=0 yields no PNE (discoordination). Fails the 2-player UPA condition.\\n- Forest with sign-symmetric digons: Any underlying tree where every mutual pair has same-sign weights admits a PNE for every W,h (by SCC composition).\\n- Functional SCC with a negative cycle: A simple directed cycle with one negative edge (product \u22121) is not UPA; with f=0, no PNE.\\n\\nObstacles\\n\\n- Full characterization of UPA SCCs beyond undirected and structurally balanced remains open. The functional-SCC theorem gives a clean iff within that subclass. General necessary conditions need care because symmetric (potential) SCCs may contain negative-sign cycles yet be UPA.\\n\\nNext steps\\n\\n- Implement a polynomial-time pipeline: DAG check; else SCC decomposition; per-SCC: (a) symmetry test (exact potential), (b) structural balance via cycle parity, (c) if functional, apply cycle-positivity test; else fall back to cohesive-core methods or bias-dominance certificates. Construct PNE by reverse topological order when all SCCs pass UPA tests.\\n- Explore whether \u201cUPA iff undirected or structurally balanced\u201d holds for strongly connected nonfunctional SCCs; seek counterexamples or a proof via domination on carefully chosen cycles.\\n- Integrate indecomposability-based stability (from the paper) once PNE existence is established, to obtain BR-reachable/stable sets when R-cores are cohesive.\\n\"}",
