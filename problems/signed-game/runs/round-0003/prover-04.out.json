W_{12}>0, W_{21}<0, take h=0. Best responses require x_1=sgn(W_{12}x_2)=x_2 and x_2=sgn(W_{21}x_1)=\u2212x_1, impossible. Hence not UPA.\n(\u21d0) Sufficiency: If W_{12},W_{21}\u22650, the game is unsigned (supermodular) so admits a PNE for all h. If W_{12},W_{21}\u22640, pick \u03c3=(1,\u22121); then [\u03c3]W[\u03c3] has nonnegative off-diagonal entries, hence the switched game is unsigned and admits a PNE for all switched h; mapping back via x=[\u03c3]y preserves PNE. \u220e\n\nLemma 2 (Row-sum consensus certificate)\nIf h_i+\u2211_j W_{ij}\u22650 for all i, then x\u2261+1 is a PNE; if h_i+\u2211_j W_{ij}\u22640 for all i, then x\u2261\u22121 is a PNE.\nProof. At x\u2261+1, \u0394_i=u_i(+1,\u00b7)\u2212u_i(\u22121,\u00b7)=2(h_i+\u2211_j W_{ij})\u22650; similarly for x\u2261\u22121. \u220e\n\nLemma 3 (Dominant negative directed cycle obstructs PNE)\nLet C=(i_1\u2192i_2\u2192\u2026\u2192i_L\u2192i_1) be a directed cycle with sign product \u220f_{k=1}^L s_k=\u22121, where s_k=sgn(W_{i_k i_{k+1}}). Suppose, for each k,\n|W_{i_k i_{k+1}}| > |h_{i_k}| + \u2211_{j\u2260 i_{k+1}} |W_{i_k j}|.\nThen the game has no PNE.\nProof. At any profile x, for each k,\nS_k:=h_{i_k}+\u2211_j W_{i_k j}x_j = W_{i_k i_{k+1}}x_{i_{k+1}} + R_k,\nwith |R_k|<|W_{i_k i_{k+1}}|. Hence sgn(S_k)=sgn(W_{i_k i_{k+1}}x_{i_{k+1}}), so BR enforces x_{i_k}=sgn(S_k)=s_k x_{i_{k+1}}. Multiplying around C yields x_{i_1}=(\u220f s_k) x_{i_1}=\u2212x_{i_1}, impossible. \u220e\n\nTheorem 4 (Functional digraphs with sign-positive cycles are UPA)\nLet the dependency digraph be functional: each i has at most one successor s(i). For i with s(i), write w_i=W_{i s(i)}. Assume every directed cycle C satisfies \u220f_{(i\u2192j)\u2208C} sgn(w_i)=+1. Then, for every h\u2208\u211d^V, the game admits a PNE, and a BR-path to it exists.\nProof. For i with successor, define the unary best-response map\nf_i(x_{s(i)}) = sgn(h_i + w_i x_{s(i)}) \u2208 {\u00b11},\ninterpreting ties arbitrarily (either choice acceptable). If |h_i|\u2265|w_i|, then f_i is constant; else f_i(x)=sgn(w_i)\u00b7x.\nFix a directed cycle C=(i_1\u2192\u2026\u2192i_L\u2192i_1) and define F_C:=f_{i_1}\u2218f_{i_L}\u2218\u2026\u2218f_{i_2}:{\u00b11}\u2192{\u00b11}. If any f_{i_k} is constant, then F_C is constant and hence has a fixed point. If all are of the form x\u21a6sgn(w_i)\u00b7x, then F_C(x)=(\u220f sgn(w_i))\u00b7x=x by hypothesis, again two fixed points. Thus one can assign x on the cycle so that each i on C best responds.\nNow propagate outwards on each in-arborescence (edges point towards successors): for any edge j\u2192i whose successor i is already assigned, set x_j:=f_j(x_i). Since u_j depends only on x_{s(j)} and h_j, this yields a best response at j. Doing this for all components produces a profile in which every player best responds. A BR-path is obtained by updating nodes in reverse topological order of the forest branches ending at cycles, then cycling nodes to the chosen fixed point on each cycle. \u220e\n\nCorollary 5 (Necessity within the functional class for uniform guarantee)\nIn functional digraphs, if some directed cycle has negative sign product, then there exists h (e.g., h=0) for which no PNE exists.\nProof. With h=0 and all |h_i|<|w_i|, each f_i(x)=sgn(w_i)\u00b7x, so F_C(x)=\u2212x has no fixed point. \u220e\n\nExamples\n- Two-player: W_{12}=2, W_{21}=\u22123, h=0 has no PNE (Theorem 1 necessity). If W_{12}=2, W_{21}=5, any h admits a PNE (Theorem 1 sufficiency).\n- Dominant negative 3-cycle: W_{12}=\u22125, W_{23}=\u22125, W_{31}=\u22125; all other out-weights zero; h=0. Lemma 3 rules out PNE.\n- Functional positive 4-cycle: signs (+,+,\u2212,\u2212) so product +1. Theorem 4 applies; two PNE on the cycle; trees feeding in are assigned uniquely.\n\nAlgorithms/checks\n- Two-node SCC UPA check: test W_{12}W_{21}\u22650.\n- Functional UPA check: verify outdegree \u22641 and positive sign on each directed cycle (linear time); then construct PNE by cycle resolution + tree backpropagation.\n- Obstruction: if a negative directed cycle satisfies Lemma 3\u2019s dominance, declare \u201cno PNE\u201d for that h (diagnostic for instances).\n\nObstacles\n- Beyond functional SCCs, UPA characterization remains open; structural balance suffices but may not be necessary in general. Dominance obstructions give only sufficient conditions for nonexistence.\n\nNext steps\n- Extend UPA classification to SCCs that are unions of a few cycles with limited branching (bounded outdegree), via multi-unary compositions and parity arguments.\n- Provide a polynomial-time routine combining: SCC decomposition; per-SCC tests (undirected/structurally balanced/functional-positive); cycle-dominance diagnostics; cohesive-core constructions when some SCCs fail UPA.\n"
