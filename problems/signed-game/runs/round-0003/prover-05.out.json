This adds a new, fully-characterized UPA family beyond undirected/structurally balanced.\n- Provide a linear-time feasibility test for structural balance (directed sense used here) via parity constraints.\n\nLemma A (Dominant negative directed cycle obstructs PNE)\nLet G=(V,E) contain a directed cycle C=(i_1\u2192i_2\u2192\u2026\u2192i_k\u2192i_1). Fix any nonzero weights on edges not in C; for edges in C choose weights W_{i_r,i_{r+1}} = s_r L with s_r\u2208{\u00b11} and \u220f_{r=1}^k s_r = \u22121, and choose L > 2\u2211_{r=1}^k \u2211_{j\u2260i_{r+1}} |W_{i_r j}|. Set h=0. Then the SNC game has no pure Nash equilibrium.\nProof. For any profile x, at each i_r,\nsgn(h_{i_r} + \u2211_j W_{i_r j} x_j) = sgn( s_r L x_{i_{r+1}} + \u03b7_r ), with |\u03b7_r| \u2264 \u2211_{j\u2260i_{r+1}} |W_{i_r j}| < L/2.\nHence the best response is uniquely x_{i_r} = s_r x_{i_{r+1}} (no tie). Composing around C yields x_{i_1} = (\u220f s_r) x_{i_1} = \u2212x_{i_1}, a contradiction. \u220e\nCorollary. If a dependency digraph contains a directed cycle, there exists W (supported on E) and h such that no PNE exists (take the construction above). This yields the necessity direction in the uniform guarantee \u21d4 DAG theorem, even when edges not on the cycle must remain nonzero.\n\nTheorem B (Uniform guarantee \u21d4 DAG, refined)\nA dependency digraph guarantees a PNE for every real W (zero diagonal, supported on E) and every h iff it is acyclic. Sufficiency by backward induction; necessity by Lemma A.\n\nUPA SCCs for functional digraphs\nDefinition. G is functional if every row of W has \u22641 nonzero entry (outdegree \u22641). Each SCC is either a single node or a single directed cycle.\nProposition C (Functional SCCs are UPA \u21d4 cycle-sign positive)\nLet U be an SCC of a functional digraph. If U is a singleton, trivially UPA. Otherwise U is a directed k-cycle with weights a_r=W_{i_r,i_{r+1}}\u22600.\nThen the induced subgame on U is universally PNE-admitting (for all external fields f\u2208\u211d^U) iff \u220f_{r=1}^k sgn(a_r)=+1. In this case, a PNE exists for all f; if the product is \u22121, take f=0 to get no PNE.\nProof. Necessity: with f=0 and negative product, the BR constraints are x_{i_r}=sgn(a_r)x_{i_{r+1}}, impossible. Sufficiency: choose \u03c3 on U with \u03c3_{i_{r+1}}=\u03c3_{i_r} sgn(a_r), consistent as the product is +1; then [\u03c3]W_{UU}[\u03c3] has all cycle weights |a_r|>0 (unsigned). For any f, the transformed restricted subgame is an unsigned network coordination game (supermodular), hence admits a PNE; map back via x=[\u03c3]y preserves PNE (Lemma in the paper). \u220e\nCorollary D (Functional digraphs are UPA \u21d4 all cycle-signs positive)\nEvery SCC is a singleton or a directed cycle. Apply Proposition C to each SCC; the SCC-wise composition theorem then yields existence for all h.\nAlgorithm (constructive): decompose into SCCs (linear time), check each directed cycle\u2019s sign product, and if all positive, compute a PNE by solving cycles after a gauge (unsigned) and then trees feeding into them by backward induction.\n\nLemma E (Linear-time structural balance test)\nGiven directed signed G, decide if \u2203\u03c3\u2208{\u00b11}^V with [\u03c3]W[\u03c3]\u22650. For each edge (i,j), impose the parity constraint \u03c3_i \u03c3_j = sgn(W_{ij}) (require same sign for positive edges, opposite for negative). View constraints on the undirected skeleton. BFS/DFS propagation from arbitrary seeds detects inconsistency in O(|E|). Feasible \u21d4 structurally balanced (directed sense). This realizes the gauge existence in Lemma 2 of the paper algorithmically.\n\nExamples\n- Functional positive cycle (UPA): 1\u21922\u21923\u21921 with signs (+,+,+); any f admits a PNE; construct via \u03c3=+1 and unsigned cycle.\n- Functional negative cycle (non-UPA): 1\u21922\u21923\u21921 with signs (+,+,\u2212); f=0 gives no PNE.\n- Uniform obstruction on general digraph: any directed cycle allows the dominant-negative-cycle construction (Lemma A) to kill PNE for some W,h.\n\nObstacles\n- UPA classification for general SCCs beyond undirected or structurally balanced remains open; functional case gives a complete answer.\n\nNext steps\n- Extend UPA characterization from functional SCCs to \u201calmost functional\u201d (each node has at most one positive out-neighbor after an optimal gauge).\n- Combine Lemma A with cohesive-core conditions to derive graph-local obstructions/guarantees when only a few cycles are negative but heavily biased.\n- Implement an end-to-end checker: DAG? else SCCs; if each SCC is undirected/structurally balanced/functional-positive, construct a PNE by reverse-topological order; else report obstructing cycles or try cohesive-core methods."
