Main classification: a dependency digraph guarantees a PNE for every weight matrix W (zero diagonal on that digraph) and every bias h iff the digraph is acyclic (DAG) \u2014 sufficiency by backward induction, necessity via directed cycles with odd negative-product signs that force inconsistent BR constraints. SCC composition: if every SCC is \\\"universally PNE-admitting\\\" (UPA) under arbitrary external fields (examples: undirected SCCs or structurally balanced SCCs via a gauge), then solve SCCs from sinks upward to build a global PNE and BR-path. Added UPA tests: 2-node SCCs (W12W21\u22650) and functional digraphs (outdegree \u22641) where UPA \u21d4 every directed cycle has positive sign. Produced constructive sufficient conditions (cohesive-core bounds, weight-dominance), diagnostics (matching-pennies digons, dominant-negative cycles), and a draft SCC-based algorithmic pipeline.
