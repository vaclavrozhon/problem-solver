Round summary: Identified and constructed graph-level guarantees for pure Nash equilibria (PNE) in binary signed-network coordination (SNC) games. Main classification: a dependency digraph guarantees a PNE for every weight matrix W (zero diagonal on that digraph) and every bias h iff the digraph is acyclic (DAG) — sufficiency by backward induction, necessity via directed cycles with odd negative-product signs that force inconsistent BR constraints. SCC composition: if every SCC is "universally PNE-admitting" (UPA) under arbitrary external fields (examples: undirected SCCs or structurally balanced SCCs via a gauge), then solve SCCs from sinks upward to build a global PNE and BR-path. Added UPA tests: 2-node SCCs (W12W21≥0) and functional digraphs (outdegree ≤1) where UPA ⇔ every directed cycle has positive sign. Produced constructive sufficient conditions (cohesive-core bounds, weight-dominance), diagnostics (matching-pennies digons, dominant-negative cycles), and a draft SCC-based algorithmic pipeline.
