Specifically, I've identified a theorem about functional digraphs: if all directed cycles have a positive sign product, then a pure Nash equilibrium exists for any h PNE. Additionally, if there are negative product cycles, then no PNE exists. This could be a valuable addition as it provides a clear classification.

It seems that for strongly connected directed graphs with weights on arcs, the existence of \u03c3 ensuring W\u2032 = [\u03c3] W [\u03c3] \u2265 0 coincides with all directed cycles being positive.

In a directed graph with one-way edges, undirected skeleton edges have signs determined by their arrows.

In a functional SCC each node has exactly one internal out-neighbor; if all directed cycles are positive, a path-product signature \u03c3 makes all internal arcs nonnegative, hence the SCC is unsigned and supermodular for any external field; necessity follows by the negative-cycle contradiction (h=0). Lifting to the whole graph via SCC composition yields a constructive PNE. Good addition beyond DAGs (still not a graph-only uniform guarantee, but a complete UPA classification within a natural family).\\n- 2-node SCC UPA classification (W_12\u00b7W_21\u22650) is correct and its proof via switching to unsigned is clean. This forbids matching-pennies digons.\\n- Dominant negative directed cycle obstruction is correct and provides a robust nonexistence witness that tolerates extra neighbors (useful diagnostically).

If the product is \u22121, set f=0; best responses enforce x_i=sgn(W_{i,i+1})x_{i+1}, whose product implies x_1=\u2212x_1, impossible. If the product is +1, choose \u03c3 with \u03c3_i\u03c3_{i+1}=sgn(W_{i,i+1}).

If U is a singleton, the restricted subgame is trivially UPA. Otherwise U is a directed simple cycle. By the Lemma, the restricted subgame on U is UPA iff its cycle sign product is +1. For the whole graph, order SCCs in reverse topological order (condensation DAG). For sinks (cycles), pick a PNE for the restricted subgame (exists for all external fields). For predecessors, the external field induced by already fixed successors is constant; since each predecessor SCC is either a singleton (trivial) or a cycle with positive product (UPA), choose a PNE. Concatenation yields a global PNE; a BR-path is obtained by concatenating within-SCC BR-paths from sinks upwards. Conversely, if some directed cycle has negative sign product, set h=0 and restrict to that cycle; by the Lemma there is no PNE; thus the SCC (and the whole game) is not UPA. \u220e\\n\\nLemma (Dominant negative directed cycle obstruction).\\nLet C=(i_1\u2192\u2026\u2192i_L\u2192i_1) with edge signs s_k=sgn(W_{i_k,i_{k+1}}) and product \u220f s_k=\u22121.

For a cycle C, if the sign product is +1, there exists a signature \u03c3 with [\u03c3]W[\u03c3] nonnegative on C, so the restricted subgame on C is unsigned (supermodular) and admits a PNE for any external field; if the product is \u22121, with h=0 the best-response constraints around C are inconsistent, so no PNE exists.
