We validated and added a complete UPA classification for functional digraphs (outdegree ≤1): an SCC is UPA iff every directed cycle has positive sign; composed across SCCs this yields a PNE for any h, with a constructive BR-path. We confirmed the 2-node SCC UPA criterion (same-sign digon) and provided dominant-negative-cycle obstructions. We clarified directed structural balance via cycle parity with a linear-time check. Output.md now includes the functional-digraph result; proofs.md contains formal proofs. Next: characterize UPA SCCs beyond current classes and implement a full checker/constructor pipeline.
