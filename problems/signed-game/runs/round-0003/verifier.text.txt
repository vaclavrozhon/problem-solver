{"feedback_md":"The round achieved a clear, rigorous extension of our catalogue. The core modeling convention (i→j iff W_ij≠0) is consistently used. The new results fall into two buckets: (i) graph-level uniform guarantees over all W,h (already settled as “⇔ DAG”), and (ii) per-instance guarantees uniform in h but for fixed W, organized via SCCs.\n\nSoundness and value:\n- Functional digraphs (outdegree ≤ 1): The equivalence “universally PNE-admitting (UPA) ⇔ every directed cycle has positive sign product” is correct. In a functional SCC each node has exactly one internal out-neighbor; if all directed cycles are positive, a path-product signature σ makes all internal arcs nonnegative, hence the SCC is unsigned and supermodular for any external field; necessity follows by the negative-cycle contradiction (h=0). Lifting to the whole graph via SCC composition yields a constructive PNE. Good addition beyond DAGs (still not a graph-only uniform guarantee, but a complete UPA classification within a natural family).\n- 2-node SCC UPA classification (W_12·W_21≥0) is correct and its proof via switching to unsigned is clean. This forbids matching-pennies digons.\n- Dominant negative directed cycle obstruction is correct and provides a robust nonexistence witness that tolerates extra neighbors (useful diagnostically). Dominant positive cycles yield two internal PNE; this is subsumed by the SCC structural-balance/gauge argument but still clarifies robustness margins.\n- Structural balance in directed SCCs via cycle parity is stated correctly (∃σ with [σ]W[σ]≥0 iff every directed cycle has positive sign). The parity/BFS checker is appropriate.\n- Forests with sign-symmetric digons are correctly handled via SCC composition (only singletons or 2-node sign-symmetric SCCs).\n\nCaveats/clarifications:\n- Be explicit that functional-digraph guarantees are per fixed W (uniform in h), not “graph-only” guarantees over all sign assignments. Within the functional class, necessity of positive cycles is only for uniform-in-h; a negative cycle can be offset by strong biases, but then the guarantee is not uniform.\n- When asserting BR-reachability in unsigned games, cite I-path reachability and binary-action equivalence.\n\nNext steps:\n- Characterize UPA SCCs beyond undirected/structurally balanced/functional: candidates include exact/ordinal potential polymatrix blocks or classes switchable to monotone forms. Try to prove a dichotomy or provide counterexamples.\n- Implement a polynomial checker: SCC decomposition; per-SCC tests for (a) symmetry, (b) structural balance (cycle parity), (c) functional with positive cycles; else attempt cohesive-core conditions. Provide pseudocode and complexity.\n- Integrate dominance obstructions as negative certificates in the pipeline and quantify minimal margins.","summary_md":"We validated and added a complete UPA classification for functional digraphs (outdegree ≤1): an SCC is UPA iff every directed cycle has positive sign; composed across SCCs this yields a PNE for any h, with a constructive BR-path.

Proof: path-product signature σ makes internal arcs nonnegative; unsigned subgame ⇒ supermodular ⇒ PNE for all fields; negative cycle yields a contradiction at h=0. Whole-graph existence follows by SCC composition. Note: uniform in h for fixed W; not a graph-only guarantee over all W.\n- Two-node SCCs: UPA ⇔ W_{12}W_{21}≥0 (forbids matching-pennies digons).

Then the restricted subgame on C admits a PNE for every f iff ∏_{i=1}^k sgn(W_{i,i+1})=+1.\nProof. If the product is −1, set f=0; best responses enforce x_i=sgn(W_{i,i+1})x_{i+1}, whose product implies x_1=−x_1, impossible. If the product is +1, choose σ with σ_iσ_{i+1}=sgn(W_{i,i+1}). Then [σ]W has W^{[σ]}_{i,i+1}=|W_{i,i+1}|≥0, so the transformed subgame is unsigned and supermodular; for any f^{[σ]}=[σ]f it admits a PNE. Mapping back via x=[σ]y preserves PNE. ∎\n\nTheorem (Functional digraphs: UPA ⇔ all directed cycles are positive).\nAssume outdegree ≤1 for all i. Let U be an SCC. If U is a singleton, the restricted subgame is trivially UPA. Otherwise U is a directed simple cycle. By the Lemma, the restricted subgame on U is UPA iff its cycle sign product is +1. For the whole graph, order SCCs in reverse topological order (condensation DAG). For sinks (cycles), pick a PNE for the restricted subgame (exists for all external fields). For predecessors, the external field induced by already fixed successors is constant; since each predecessor SCC is either a singleton (trivial) or a cycle with positive product (UPA), choose a PNE. Concatenation yields a global PNE; a BR-path is obtained by concatenating within-SCC BR-paths from sinks upwards. Conversely, if some directed cycle has negative sign product, set h=0 and restrict to that cycle; by the Lemma there is no PNE; thus the SCC (and the whole game) is not UPA. ∎\n\nLemma (Dominant negative directed cycle obstruction).\nLet C=(i_1→…→i_L→i_1) with edge signs s_k=sgn(W_{i_k,i_{k+1}}) and product ∏ s_k=−1. Suppose for each k, |W_{i_k,i_{k+1}}| > |h_{i_k}| + ∑_{j≠i_{k+1}} |W_{i_k j}|. Then no PNE exists.\nProof. For any profile x, S_k=h_{i_k}+∑_j W_{i_k j}x_j has sign sgn(W_{i_k,i_{k+1}}x_{i_{k+1}}), hence best response enforces x_{i_k}=s_k x_{i_{k+1}}. Multiplying around C yields x_{i_1}=−x_{i_1}, a contradiction. ∎"},"output_update":{"action":"append","content":"4) Functional digraphs (outdegree ≤ 1)\nTheorem (UPA ⇔ all directed cycles positive). Suppose each vertex has outdegree ≤1. Decompose the graph into SCCs; each SCC is either a singleton or a directed simple cycle. The game admits a PNE for every bias vector h (uniform in h) if and only if every directed cycle C has positive sign product ∏_{(i→j)∈C} sgn(W_{ij})=+1. A best-response path to a PNE exists.\nProof. For a cycle C, if the sign product is +1, there exists a signature σ with [σ]W[σ] nonnegative on C, so the restricted subgame on C is unsigned (supermodular) and admits a PNE for any external field; if the product is −1, with h=0 the best-response constraints around C are inconsistent, so no PNE exists. Singletons are trivial. Process SCCs in reverse topological order: choose a PNE for each sink cycle, then for upstream singletons set their action as a best response to their unique successor.
