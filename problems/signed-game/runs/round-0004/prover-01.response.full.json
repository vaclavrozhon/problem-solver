For a signature \u03c3\u2208{\u00b11}^V, gauge-transformed data: W^{[\u03c3]}=[\u03c3]W[\u03c3], h^{[\u03c3]}=[\u03c3]h; and u_i^{[\u03c3]}(x)=u_i([\u03c3]x).\\n\\nTheorem (multi-core cohesive existence)\\nLet V=R^1 \u2294 \u2026 \u2294 R^m \u2294 S. For each t=1,\u2026,m, suppose there exists \u03c4^{(t)}\u2208{\u00b11}^{R^t} such that\\n(1) \u03c4_i^{(t)} W_{ij} \u03c4_j^{(t)} \u2265 0 for all i,j\u2208R^t (i.e., G_{R^t}^{[\u03c4^{(t)}]} is unsigned);\\n(2) w_i^{R^t} + \u03c4_i^{(t)} h_i \u2265 w_i^{V\\\\R^t} for all i\u2208R^t.\\nLet \u03c4_R be the concatenation of \u03c4^{(1)},\u2026,\u03c4^{(m)} on R=\u2294_t R^t. Assume the S-restricted game with R frozen at \u03c4_R admits a PNE z^*\u2208{\u00b11}^S. Then the full game admits a PNE x^* with x^*_{R^t}=\u03c4^{(t)} for all t and x^*_S=z^*.\\nProof. Define \u03c3\u2208{\u00b11}^V by \u03c3_i=\u03c4_i^{(t)} if i\u2208R^t, and \u03c3_i=1 if i\u2208S. Consider the [\u03c3]-transformed game. By (1), each block (G_{R^t})^{[\u03c3]} is unsigned; w_i^{R^t} and w_i^{V\\\\R^t} are invariant under gauge. Moreover h_i^{[\u03c3]}=\u03c3_i h_i=\u03c4_i^{(t)} h_i for i\u2208R^t, and u_i^{[\u03c3]}(1_{R},z)=u_i(\u03c4_R,z) for i\u2208S, so z^* is a PNE for the S-restricted transformed game with R frozen at 1_R. By (2), for each i\u2208R^t one has w_i^{R^t}+h_i^{[\u03c3]} \u2265 w_i^{V\\\\R^t}, which implies that in the transformed game, given (1_R,z^*), player i\u2019s unique best response is +1 (the marginal 2(w_i^{R^t}+h_i^{[\u03c3]}+(W_{i,S}z^*) ) is \u2265 2(w_i^{R^t}+h_i^{[\u03c3]}\u2212w_i^{S}) \u2265 0). Hence x\u0303^*=(1_R,z^*) is a PNE of the transformed game. Mapping back via x^*=[\u03c3]x\u0303^* yields u_i(x^*)=u_i^{[\u03c3]}(x\u0303^*), so x^* is a PNE of the original game with x^*_{R^t}=\u03c4^{(t)} and x^*_S=z^*. \u220e\\nRemarks.\\n- This strictly generalizes the single-core result (m=1) and the polarized-core case (each \u03c4^{(t)} encodes the block\u2019s two factions).\\n- Sufficient conditions for the S-restricted existence include: G_S undirected (exact potential) or structurally balanced (gauge to unsigned).\\n\\nLemma (monotone bounded-length BR-path in unsigned components)\\nLet U\u2286V and suppose W_{ij}\u22650 for all i,j\u2208U (unsigned subgame), external field f\u2208\u211d^U arbitrary. Then there exists a BR-path from \u22121_U to a PNE of the U-restricted game of length at most |U|; moreover the path is monotone (coordinates only flip from \u22121 to +1).\\nProof. Define the marginal \u0394_i(x)=u_i(+1,x_{\u2212i})\u2212u_i(\u22121,x_{\u2212i})=2(f_i+\u2211_{j\u2208U} W_{ij}x_j). If W\u22650, then \u0394_i(\u00b7) is nondecreasing in x. Start at y^{(0)}=\u22121_U. Iteratively, if some i satisfies \u0394_i(y^{(k)})>0, pick one and set y^{(k+1)} by flipping i from \u22121 to +1. Monotonicity implies that once a player flips to +1, her marginal cannot decrease below 0 in subsequent steps, so no player flips back; thus at most |U| flips occur. When no \u0394_i>0 remains, y^{(\u2113)} is a PNE: each +1 has \u0394_i\u22650 and each \u22121 has \u0394_i\u22640. Each step is a best response flip, so (y^{(0)},\u2026,y^{(\u2113)}) is a BR-path. \u220e\\n\\nCorollary (BR-path bounds under SCC composition with unsigned SCCs)\\nSuppose the SCCs U_1,\u2026,U_m of the condensation DAG are such that for each k there exists a signature \u03c3^{(k)} with (W_{U_k U_k})^{[\u03c3^{(k)}]}\u22650 (e.g., U_k structurally balanced). Then, fixing any h, there exists a BR-path to a PNE whose length is at most \u2211_{k=1}^m |U_k|: process SCCs in reverse topological order, apply the monotone lemma within each (after the corresponding gauge) with external fields induced by later SCCs, and concatenate the within-SCC paths.\\n\\nExamples\\n- Two cohesive blocks. Let R^1,R^2 be disjoint unsigned subgraphs, S arbitrary undirected. If for some \u03c4^{(1)}=1_{R^1}, \u03c4^{(2)}=\u22121_{R^2}, the bounds w_i^{R^1}+h_i \u2265 w_i^{V\\\\R^1} for i\u2208R^1 and w_i^{R^2}\u2212h_i \u2265 w_i^{V\\\\R^2} for i\u2208R^2 hold, and the S-restricted game with R frozen at (1_{R^1},\u22121_{R^2}) has a PNE, then the full game has a PNE with x_{R^1}=1, x_{R^2}=\u22121.\\n- SCC BR-length. If the graph is a single structurally balanced SCC of size n, then after the appropriate gauge the game is unsigned and there is a BR-path from \u22121 to a PNE of length \u2264 n. For a condensation with SCC sizes n_1,\u2026,n_m, the concatenated path has length \u2264 \u2211 n_k.\\n\\nObstacles\\n- The bounded-length BR-path construction relies on unsignedness (after a gauge) within SCCs. For undirected SCCs (exact potential but not unsigned), existence is guaranteed but no comparable uniform length bound follows from monotonicity.\\n- A full characterization of universally PNE-admitting SCCs (for all external fields) beyond the unsigned-after-switching and exact-potential cases remains open. Negative signed cycles that are not \u201cdominant\u201d do not automatically preclude PNE for fixed W and arbitrary fields.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Extend multi-core existence to hierarchical cores (R decomposed into layers) with nested cohesiveness inequalities, yielding controlled prescriptions on multiple groups simultaneously.\\n- Develop per-SCC BR-length bounds under weaker conditions (e.g., quasi-Metzler after switching with bounded negative part relative to positive couplings).\\n- Implement the SCC pipeline with (a) structural-balance switching test, (b) undirectedness test, (c) functional SCC positive-cycle test; then apply the monotone BR schedule to produce explicit BR-paths with provable length bounds where applicable.\\n\"}",
