For every undirected edge {i,j}, either exactly one directed arc exists (say i\u2192j) or both directions exist with the same sign sgn(W_{ij})=sgn(W_{ji}). Then, for any h\u2208\u211d^V, the SNC game admits a PNE; a BR-path exists.\nProof.\nDecompose into SCCs. Because the undirected support is a forest, SCCs are either singletons or 2-node digons. Singletons are trivial. A 2-node digon with same-sign arcs satisfies W_{12}W_{21}\u22650, hence is universally PNE-admitting (Lemma A in notes: gauge to unsigned, then supermodular). Contract SCCs to a DAG and solve by reverse topological order (SCC composition theorem in notes). Concatenate within-SCC BR-paths to obtain a global BR-path. \u220e\n\nProposition 2 (Directed structural balance \u21d4 no negative directed cycle; linear-time test)\nFor an SCC U, the following are equivalent:\n(i) \u2203\u03c3\u2208{\u00b11}^U such that [\u03c3]W_{UU}[\u03c3] has nonnegative entries.\n(ii) Every directed cycle in the support of W_{UU} has positive sign product.\nMoreover, (ii) can be checked in O(|U|+|E_U|) time by parity labeling.\nProof.\n(i)\u21d2(ii): Along any directed cycle i_1\u2192\u2026\u2192i_k\u2192i_1, the product \u220f_r sgn(W_{i_r,i_{r+1}})=\u220f_r \u03c3_{i_r}\u03c3_{i_{r+1}}=+1.\n(ii)\u21d2(i): Fix a root r and set \u03c3_j:=sgn(P_{r\u2192j}), the sign of any directed path product from r to j. By (ii) path signs are well-defined (independent of the chosen path). Then for each arc i\u2192j, we get \u03c3_i\u03c3_j=sgn(W_{ij}), so [\u03c3]W[\u03c3]\u22650. Algorithmically: run a BFS/DFS on the underlying directed support; whenever exploring i\u2192j, enforce label consistency \u03c3_j:=\u03c3_i\u00b7sgn(W_{ij}); if j is already labeled, a mismatch (\u03c3_j\u2260\u03c3_i\u00b7sgn(W_{ij})) reveals a negative directed cycle; otherwise continue. This visits each arc once. \u220e\n\nLemma 3 (Robust nonexistence via dominant negative cycle)\nLet C be a directed simple cycle i_1\u2192\u2026\u2192i_k\u2192i_1 with sign product \u22121 and for each r,\n|W_{i_r,i_{r+1}}| > |h_{i_r}| + \u2211_{j\u2260i_{r+1}} |W_{i_r j}|.\nThen the SNC game has no PNE.\nProof.\nUnder the margin, BR at i_r is uniquely x_{i_r}=sgn(W_{i_r,i_{r+1}})x_{i_{r+1}}, independent of all other influences. Chaining yields x_{i_1}=(\u220f sgn) x_{i_1}=\u2212x_{i_1}, impossible. \u220e\n\nExamples\n- Forest-with-digons: a path 1\u20132\u20133 with arcs 1\u21922, 2\u21943 and sgn(W_{23})=sgn(W_{32})<0. SCCs are {1}, {2,3}; the digon is UPA (gauge to unsigned); DAG-of-SCCs \u21d2 global PNE for any h.\n- Structural-balance test: an SCC consisting of a 4-cycle with signs (+,\u2212,\u2212,+) passes (ii) (product +1) and the labeling recovers \u03c3 to gauge it unsigned.\n\nObstacles\n- Proposition 1 is per-instance: it depends on the realized W (sign symmetry on digons), not only on the unweighted graph. This matches our SCC framework.\n- UPA characterization for general (nonfunctional, chorded) SCCs remains open beyond structural balance; negative directed cycles are necessary obstructions only under dominance.\n\nNext steps\n- Extend UPA certificates beyond balance to include exact/ordinal potential polymatrix blocks; identify minimal forbidden signed substructures.\n- Provide end-to-end checker: SCC decomposition; per-SCC tests (symmetry; Proposition 2; 2-node Lemma; functional-positive cycles); else try cohesive-core conditions; include Lemma 3 as a fast obstruction.\n- Quantify minimal dominance margins on cycles that ensure the obstruction or, conversely, guarantee two internal PNE on positive cycles independent of external fields."
