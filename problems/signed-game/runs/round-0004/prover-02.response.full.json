This would be specific to the instance rather than graph-level. Another thought is about undirected graphs that form trees. In those cases, any orientation and sign assignment might not be uniform across W. I'm curious if a transformation can maintain acyclic influences, considering tree structures with unlimited outdegree but potentially resulting in directed cycles.",

In trees, there's only one undirected edge between nodes, so having both directions would indeed create a 2-cycle. If I disallow bidirectional edges, then an oriented tree becomes a directed acyclic graph (DAG), ensuring that guarantee exists. If bidirectional edges allowed with the same sign, it leads to a structural balance, and I can propose a \"forest with sign-symmetric digons\" for formalization.",

However, tournaments usually contain directed cycles, except for transitive tournaments, which is where the guarantee of being a DAG comes in. I can propose an \"edge contraction\" technique for replacing a UPA SCC with a supernode that computes influences. The remaining structure is still an SNC game, aligning with current SCC compositions. I also wonder about proposing a \"Cartesian product class,\" even if it feels unnatural.",

If an SCC contains a negative directed cycle, it can't be UPA, according to Theorem B. Also, if it has a pair with opposite signs in both directions (like a matching pennies situation), that's another sign it's not UPA.

I noticed that a 3-cycle negative setup doesn't guarantee a PNE when there's only one outgoing edge per node, but we could modify surrounding influences. The UPA property should mean positive signs for directed cycles, by isolating them. However, I can't rely on that for general cases. I might propose a \"Forest with sign-consistent digons\" theorem.

For every undirected edge {i,j}, either exactly one directed arc exists (say i\u2192j) or both directions exist with the same sign sgn(W_{ij})=sgn(W_{ji}). Then, for any h\u2208\u211d^V, the SNC game admits a PNE; a BR-path exists.\\nProof.\\nDecompose into SCCs. Because the undirected support is a forest, SCCs are either singletons or 2-node digons. Singletons are trivial. A 2-node digon with same-sign arcs satisfies W_{12}W_{21}\u22650, hence is universally PNE-admitting (Lemma A in notes: gauge to unsigned, then supermodular). Contract SCCs to a DAG and solve by reverse topological order (SCC composition theorem in notes). Concatenate within-SCC BR-paths to obtain a global BR-path. \u220e\\n\\nProposition 2 (Directed structural balance \u21d4 no negative directed cycle; linear-time test)\\nFor an SCC U, the following are equivalent:\\n(i) \u2203\u03c3\u2208{\u00b11}^U such that [\u03c3]W_{UU}[\u03c3] has nonnegative entries.\\n(ii) Every directed cycle in the support of W_{UU} has positive sign product.\\nMoreover, (ii) can be checked in O(|U|+|E_U|) time by parity labeling.\\nProof.\\n(i)\u21d2(ii): Along any directed cycle i_1\u2192\u2026\u2192i_k\u2192i_1, the product \u220f_r sgn(W_{i_r,i_{r+1}})=\u220f_r \u03c3_{i_r}\u03c3_{i_{r+1}}=+1.\\n(ii)\u21d2(i): Fix a root r and set \u03c3_j:=sgn(P_{r\u2192j}), the sign of any directed path product from r to j. By (ii) path signs are well-defined (independent of the chosen path). Then for each arc i\u2192j, we get \u03c3_i\u03c3_j=sgn(W_{ij}), so [\u03c3]W[\u03c3]\u22650. Algorithmically: run a BFS/DFS on the underlying directed support; whenever exploring i\u2192j, enforce label consistency \u03c3_j:=\u03c3_i\u00b7sgn(W_{ij}); if j is already labeled, a mismatch (\u03c3_j\u2260\u03c3_i\u00b7sgn(W_{ij})) reveals a negative directed cycle; otherwise continue. This visits each arc once. \u220e\\n\\nLemma 3 (Robust nonexistence via dominant negative cycle)\\nLet C be a directed simple cycle i_1\u2192\u2026\u2192i_k\u2192i_1 with sign product \u22121 and for each r,\\n|W_{i_r,i_{r+1}}| > |h_{i_r}| + \u2211_{j\u2260i_{r+1}} |W_{i_r j}|.\\nThen the SNC game has no PNE.\\nProof.\\nUnder the margin, BR at i_r is uniquely x_{i_r}=sgn(W_{i_r,i_{r+1}})x_{i_{r+1}}, independent of all other influences. Chaining yields x_{i_1}=(\u220f sgn) x_{i_1}=\u2212x_{i_1}, impossible. \u220e\\n\\nExamples\\n- Forest-with-digons: a path 1\u20132\u20133 with arcs 1\u21922, 2\u21943 and sgn(W_{23})=sgn(W_{32})<0. SCCs are {1}, {2,3}; the digon is UPA (gauge to unsigned); DAG-of-SCCs \u21d2 global PNE for any h.\\n- Structural-balance test: an SCC consisting of a 4-cycle with signs (+,\u2212,\u2212,+) passes (ii) (product +1) and the labeling recovers \u03c3 to gauge it unsigned.\\n\\nObstacles\\n- Proposition 1 is per-instance: it depends on the realized W (sign symmetry on digons), not only on the unweighted graph. This matches our SCC framework.\\n- UPA characterization for general (nonfunctional, chorded) SCCs remains open beyond structural balance; negative directed cycles are necessary obstructions only under dominance.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Extend UPA certificates beyond balance to include exact/ordinal potential polymatrix blocks; identify minimal forbidden signed substructures.\\n- Provide end-to-end checker: SCC decomposition; per-SCC tests (symmetry; Proposition 2; 2-node Lemma; functional-positive cycles); else try cohesive-core conditions; include Lemma 3 as a fast obstruction.\\n- Quantify minimal dominance margins on cycles that ensure the obstruction or, conversely, guarantee two internal PNE on positive cycles independent of external fields.\"}",
