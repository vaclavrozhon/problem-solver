Ideas
- We add two clean, checkable guarantees and a linear-time tester that the verifier can port to proofs.md/output.md:
  1) Forest-with-symmetric-digons class: global PNE for all h by SCC composition with a complete proof.
  2) Directed structural-balance tester (linear-time) under our directed convention (i→j iff W_{ij}≠0): no negative directed cycle ⇔ ∃σ with [σ]W[σ]≥0 on the SCC; give an explicit labeling algorithm.
- We also record a robust nonexistence certificate (dominant negative cycle) in a compact, reusable form.

Proposition 1 (Forests with sign-symmetric digons ⇒ PNE for all h)
Let G have underlying undirected graph a forest. For every undirected edge {i,j}, either exactly one directed arc exists (say i→j) or both directions exist with the same sign sgn(W_{ij})=sgn(W_{ji}). Then, for any h∈ℝ^V, the SNC game admits a PNE; a BR-path exists.
Proof.
Decompose into SCCs. Because the undirected support is a forest, SCCs are either singletons or 2-node digons. Singletons are trivial. A 2-node digon with same-sign arcs satisfies W_{12}W_{21}≥0, hence is universally PNE-admitting (Lemma A in notes: gauge to unsigned, then supermodular). Contract SCCs to a DAG and solve by reverse topological order (SCC composition theorem in notes). Concatenate within-SCC BR-paths to obtain a global BR-path. ∎

Proposition 2 (Directed structural balance ⇔ no negative directed cycle; linear-time test)
For an SCC U, the following are equivalent:
(i) ∃σ∈{±1}^U such that [σ]W_{UU}[σ] has nonnegative entries.
(ii) Every directed cycle in the support of W_{UU} has positive sign product.
Moreover, (ii) can be checked in O(|U|+|E_U|) time by parity labeling.
Proof.
(i)⇒(ii): Along any directed cycle i_1→…→i_k→i_1, the product ∏_r sgn(W_{i_r,i_{r+1}})=∏_r σ_{i_r}σ_{i_{r+1}}=+1.
(ii)⇒(i): Fix a root r and set σ_j:=sgn(P_{r→j}), the sign of any directed path product from r to j. By (ii) path signs are well-defined (independent of the chosen path). Then for each arc i→j, we get σ_iσ_j=sgn(W_{ij}), so [σ]W[σ]≥0. Algorithmically: run a BFS/DFS on the underlying directed support; whenever exploring i→j, enforce label consistency σ_j:=σ_i·sgn(W_{ij}); if j is already labeled, a mismatch (σ_j≠σ_i·sgn(W_{ij})) reveals a negative directed cycle; otherwise continue. This visits each arc once. ∎

Lemma 3 (Robust nonexistence via dominant negative cycle)
Let C be a directed simple cycle i_1→…→i_k→i_1 with sign product −1 and for each r,
|W_{i_r,i_{r+1}}| > |h_{i_r}| + ∑_{j≠i_{r+1}} |W_{i_r j}|.
Then the SNC game has no PNE.
Proof.
Under the margin, BR at i_r is uniquely x_{i_r}=sgn(W_{i_r,i_{r+1}})x_{i_{r+1}}, independent of all other influences. Chaining yields x_{i_1}=(∏ sgn) x_{i_1}=−x_{i_1}, impossible. ∎

Examples
- Forest-with-digons: a path 1–2–3 with arcs 1→2, 2↔3 and sgn(W_{23})=sgn(W_{32})<0. SCCs are {1}, {2,3}; the digon is UPA (gauge to unsigned); DAG-of-SCCs ⇒ global PNE for any h.
- Structural-balance test: an SCC consisting of a 4-cycle with signs (+,−,−,+) passes (ii) (product +1) and the labeling recovers σ to gauge it unsigned.

Obstacles
- Proposition 1 is per-instance: it depends on the realized W (sign symmetry on digons), not only on the unweighted graph. This matches our SCC framework.
- UPA characterization for general (nonfunctional, chorded) SCCs remains open beyond structural balance; negative directed cycles are necessary obstructions only under dominance.

Next steps
- Extend UPA certificates beyond balance to include exact/ordinal potential polymatrix blocks; identify minimal forbidden signed substructures.
- Provide end-to-end checker: SCC decomposition; per-SCC tests (symmetry; Proposition 2; 2-node Lemma; functional-positive cycles); else try cohesive-core conditions; include Lemma 3 as a fast obstruction.
- Quantify minimal dominance margins on cycles that ensure the obstruction or, conversely, guarantee two internal PNE on positive cycles independent of external fields.
