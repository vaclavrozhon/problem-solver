We give new auditable modules: (i) dominant-cycle obstruction (nonexistence); (ii) positive dominant cycles yield exactly two internal PNE; (iii) forests with sign-symmetric digons (PNE via SCC composition); (iv) 2-node SCC UPA characterization; (v) structural-balance parity checker on SCCs; (vi) a concise uniform guarantee classification (\u21d4 DAG).\\n\\nNew results and proofs\\n\\n1) Dominant negative directed cycle \u21d2 no PNE (robust obstruction)\\nLemma. Let C be a directed cycle i\u2192s(i) over nodes U\u2286V. Suppose for every i\u2208U, |W_{i,s(i)}|>\u2211_{j\u2208V\\\\{s(i)}}|W_{ij}| and the sign product \u220f_{i\u2208U} sgn(W_{i,s(i)})=\u22121. Then there is no PNE for any h with |h_i|< |W_{i,s(i)}|\u2212\u2211_{j\u2260 s(i)}|W_{ij}| for all i\u2208U (no restriction on h outside U).\\nProof. For any profile x, for i\u2208U, the strict dominance yields sgn(h_i+\u2211_j W_{ij}x_j)=sgn(W_{i,s(i)} x_{s(i)}). Hence any best response satisfies x_i=sgn(W_{i,s(i)}) x_{s(i)}. Composing along C gives x_i=(\u220f sgn(W_{k,s(k)})) x_i=\u2212x_i, impossible. Thus no PNE.\\n\\n2) Dominant positive directed cycle \u21d2 exactly two internal PNE (robust)\\nLemma. Under the same dominance hypothesis but with \u220f_{i\u2208U} sgn(W_{i,s(i)})=+1, the subgame on U has exactly two PNE for any h with |h_i|< |W_{i,s(i)}|\u2212\u2211_{j\u2260 s(i)}|W_{ij}|: the two assignments consistent with x_i=sgn(W_{i,s(i)}) x_{s(i)} (one global sign flip).\\nProof. Dominance forces the same signed constraints; product +1 makes them consistent with two solutions differing by global sign on U. Strict dominance makes all i\u2208U strict best responders in both solutions.\\n\\n3) Two-player SCC: UPA iff sign-symmetric digon\\nLemma. For U={1,2}, the induced subgame is universally PNE-admitting (UPA) for all external fields f\u2208\u211d^U iff W_{12}W_{21}\u22650.\\nProof. If W_{12}W_{21}\u22650, pick \u03c3 with \u03c3_1=1, \u03c3_2=sgn(W_{12}). Then [\u03c3]W_{UU}[\u03c3] has nonnegative off-diagonals, so the subgame is unsigned and supermodular \u21d2 PNE for all f. If W_{12}W_{21}<0, with f=0 the best-response equations x_1=sgn(W_{12}x_2), x_2=sgn(W_{21}x_1) compose to x_1=\u2212x_1, impossible.\\n\\n4) Forests with sign-symmetric digons \u21d2 PNE (per W,h)\\nTheorem. If the underlying undirected graph is a forest and every digon {i,j} has sgn(W_{ij})=sgn(W_{ji}), then for any W,h a PNE exists.\\nProof. Every SCC is a singleton or a 2-node digon. Singletons are trivially UPA; sign-symmetric digons are UPA by (3). The SCC condensation DAG is acyclic; selecting per-SCC PNE in reverse topological order yields a global PNE (SCC composition).\\n\\n5) Structural balance in SCCs via cycle parity (checker)\\nProposition. For a strongly connected U, the following are equivalent: (i) \u2203\u03c3\u2208{\u00b11}^U with [\u03c3]W_{UU}[\u03c3]\u22650; (ii) every directed cycle in U has positive sign product.\\nProof. (i)\u21d2(ii): multiplying signs along any cycle gives +1. (ii)\u21d2(i): fix r\u2208U with \u03c3_r=1; for any v, let \u03c3_v be the product of edge signs along any directed path r\u2192\u2026\u2192v. Cycle positivity ensures path-independence and sgn(W_{ij})=\u03c3_i\u03c3_j on every arc, hence [\u03c3]W_{UU}[\u03c3]\u22650.\\n\\n6) Uniform guarantee classification (graph-only, all W,h)\\nTheorem. A dependency digraph guarantees a PNE for every real W supported on it (zero diagonal) and every h iff it is a DAG.\\nProof. If DAG, backward induction along a topological order constructs a PNE (and a BR-path). If there is a directed cycle C, choose h=0 and let W be supported only on C with an odd number of negative edges; then BR constraints x_i=sgn(W_{i,s(i)})x_{s(i)} are inconsistent, so no PNE. Hence \u21d4.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\n- Matching-pennies digon: W_{12}=1, W_{21}=\u22121, h=0. By (3) not UPA; indeed no PNE.\\n- Dominant negative cycle: a 3-cycle with W_{i,s(i)}=2, all other outgoing weights <1/2, and product of signs \u22121; by (1), no PNE for |h_i|<3/2.\\n- Forest with sign-symmetric digons: any tree with each mutual pair sharing same sign; by (4) a PNE exists for any W,h.\\n\\nObstacles\\n\\n- Necessity of structural balance for UPA on general SCCs is open. Countervailing internal arcs may offset a negative cycle for some f, so non-balance need not preclude PNE for all external fields. We established necessity within the functional (outdegree-1) case, but not in general.\\n\\nNext steps\\n\\n- Per-SCC certification: implement tests in O(|E|): symmetry (exact potential), structural balance via cycle parity, 2-node UPA test. Use SCC composition to construct PNE when all SCCs pass.\\n- Integrate obstructions (dominant negative cycles) as negative certificates; add positive-cycle module to produce internal PNE.\\n- Explore beyond undirected/structurally balanced UPA SCCs (e.g., switchable to Metzler forms, ordinal potentials), or prove necessity of structural balance for UPA.\\n\"}",
