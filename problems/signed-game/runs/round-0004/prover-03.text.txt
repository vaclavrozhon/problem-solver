Ideas

- We refine per-instance and per-SCC certificates ensuring or obstructing pure NE (PNE) in binary signed network coordination (SNC) games u_i(x)=x_i(h_i+∑_j W_{ij}x_j), with dependency arc i→j iff W_{ij}≠0. We give new auditable modules: (i) dominant-cycle obstruction (nonexistence); (ii) positive dominant cycles yield exactly two internal PNE; (iii) forests with sign-symmetric digons (PNE via SCC composition); (iv) 2-node SCC UPA characterization; (v) structural-balance parity checker on SCCs; (vi) a concise uniform guarantee classification (⇔ DAG).

New results and proofs

1) Dominant negative directed cycle ⇒ no PNE (robust obstruction)
Lemma. Let C be a directed cycle i→s(i) over nodes U⊆V. Suppose for every i∈U, |W_{i,s(i)}|>∑_{j∈V\{s(i)}}|W_{ij}| and the sign product ∏_{i∈U} sgn(W_{i,s(i)})=−1. Then there is no PNE for any h with |h_i|< |W_{i,s(i)}|−∑_{j≠ s(i)}|W_{ij}| for all i∈U (no restriction on h outside U).
Proof. For any profile x, for i∈U, the strict dominance yields sgn(h_i+∑_j W_{ij}x_j)=sgn(W_{i,s(i)} x_{s(i)}). Hence any best response satisfies x_i=sgn(W_{i,s(i)}) x_{s(i)}. Composing along C gives x_i=(∏ sgn(W_{k,s(k)})) x_i=−x_i, impossible. Thus no PNE.

2) Dominant positive directed cycle ⇒ exactly two internal PNE (robust)
Lemma. Under the same dominance hypothesis but with ∏_{i∈U} sgn(W_{i,s(i)})=+1, the subgame on U has exactly two PNE for any h with |h_i|< |W_{i,s(i)}|−∑_{j≠ s(i)}|W_{ij}|: the two assignments consistent with x_i=sgn(W_{i,s(i)}) x_{s(i)} (one global sign flip).
Proof. Dominance forces the same signed constraints; product +1 makes them consistent with two solutions differing by global sign on U. Strict dominance makes all i∈U strict best responders in both solutions.

3) Two-player SCC: UPA iff sign-symmetric digon
Lemma. For U={1,2}, the induced subgame is universally PNE-admitting (UPA) for all external fields f∈ℝ^U iff W_{12}W_{21}≥0.
Proof. If W_{12}W_{21}≥0, pick σ with σ_1=1, σ_2=sgn(W_{12}). Then [σ]W_{UU}[σ] has nonnegative off-diagonals, so the subgame is unsigned and supermodular ⇒ PNE for all f. If W_{12}W_{21}<0, with f=0 the best-response equations x_1=sgn(W_{12}x_2), x_2=sgn(W_{21}x_1) compose to x_1=−x_1, impossible.

4) Forests with sign-symmetric digons ⇒ PNE (per W,h)
Theorem. If the underlying undirected graph is a forest and every digon {i,j} has sgn(W_{ij})=sgn(W_{ji}), then for any W,h a PNE exists.
Proof. Every SCC is a singleton or a 2-node digon. Singletons are trivially UPA; sign-symmetric digons are UPA by (3). The SCC condensation DAG is acyclic; selecting per-SCC PNE in reverse topological order yields a global PNE (SCC composition).

5) Structural balance in SCCs via cycle parity (checker)
Proposition. For a strongly connected U, the following are equivalent: (i) ∃σ∈{±1}^U with [σ]W_{UU}[σ]≥0; (ii) every directed cycle in U has positive sign product.
Proof. (i)⇒(ii): multiplying signs along any cycle gives +1. (ii)⇒(i): fix r∈U with σ_r=1; for any v, let σ_v be the product of edge signs along any directed path r→…→v. Cycle positivity ensures path-independence and sgn(W_{ij})=σ_iσ_j on every arc, hence [σ]W_{UU}[σ]≥0.

6) Uniform guarantee classification (graph-only, all W,h)
Theorem. A dependency digraph guarantees a PNE for every real W supported on it (zero diagonal) and every h iff it is a DAG.
Proof. If DAG, backward induction along a topological order constructs a PNE (and a BR-path). If there is a directed cycle C, choose h=0 and let W be supported only on C with an odd number of negative edges; then BR constraints x_i=sgn(W_{i,s(i)})x_{s(i)} are inconsistent, so no PNE. Hence ⇔.

Examples

- Matching-pennies digon: W_{12}=1, W_{21}=−1, h=0. By (3) not UPA; indeed no PNE.
- Dominant negative cycle: a 3-cycle with W_{i,s(i)}=2, all other outgoing weights <1/2, and product of signs −1; by (1), no PNE for |h_i|<3/2.
- Forest with sign-symmetric digons: any tree with each mutual pair sharing same sign; by (4) a PNE exists for any W,h.

Obstacles

- Necessity of structural balance for UPA on general SCCs is open. Countervailing internal arcs may offset a negative cycle for some f, so non-balance need not preclude PNE for all external fields. We established necessity within the functional (outdegree-1) case, but not in general.

Next steps

- Per-SCC certification: implement tests in O(|E|): symmetry (exact potential), structural balance via cycle parity, 2-node UPA test. Use SCC composition to construct PNE when all SCCs pass.
- Integrate obstructions (dominant negative cycles) as negative certificates; add positive-cycle module to produce internal PNE.
- Explore beyond undirected/structurally balanced UPA SCCs (e.g., switchable to Metzler forms, ordinal potentials), or prove necessity of structural balance for UPA.
