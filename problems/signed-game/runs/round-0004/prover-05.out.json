Choose signs s_r\u2208{\u00b11} with \u220f_{r=1}^k s_r = \u22121 and set W_{i_r i_{r+1}}=s_r L, h=0. Let all other edges have arbitrary nonzero weights independent of L. If\nL > 2 max_{r} \u2211_{j\u2260i_{r+1}} |W_{i_r j}|,\nthen the SNC game has no pure NE.\nProof. For each r, the BR condition at i_r is sign(h_{i_r}+\u2211_j W_{i_r j} x_j)=sign(s_r L x_{i_{r+1}}+\u03b7_r) with |\u03b7_r|<L/2, hence x_{i_r}=s_r x_{i_{r+1}} (unique). Composing along C yields x_{i_1}=(\u220f s_r) x_{i_1}=\u2212x_{i_1}, a contradiction. \u220e\nCorollary. Any digraph with a directed cycle fails to uniformly guarantee PNE over all W,h (necessity direction for the \u201cuniform guarantee \u21d4 DAG\u201d). Lemma A is robust to extra neighbors and nonzero weights off-cycle.\n\nProposition B (Functional SCCs are UPA \u21d4 all cycle-signs positive)\nAssume outdegree(i)\u22641 for all i. Each SCC U is either a singleton or a simple directed cycle C=(i_1\u2192\u22ef\u2192i_k\u2192i_1) with weights a_r=W_{i_r i_{r+1}}\u22600. Then the restricted subgame on U is universally PNE-admitting (for every external field f\u2208\u211d^U) iff \u220f_{r=1}^k sgn(a_r)=+1.\nProof. If the product is \u22121, with f=0 BR constraints x_{i_r}=sgn(a_r) x_{i_{r+1}} are inconsistent. If +1, define \u03c3 by \u03c3_{i_{r+1}}=\u03c3_{i_r} sgn(a_r); consistency follows from the positive product. Then [\u03c3]W_{UU}[\u03c3] has all cycle entries |a_r|>0 (unsigned). For any f, the transformed restricted subgame is an unsigned network coordination game (supermodular), hence admits a PNE; mapping back by x=[\u03c3]y preserves PNE. \u220e\nCorollary C (Functional digraphs with positive cycles \u21d2 existence and BR-path). If every SCC is functional and every directed cycle has positive sign, then for every h the game admits a PNE. Construct it SCC-wise in reverse topological order; concatenate within-SCC BR-paths to obtain a global BR-path.\n\nLemma D (Linear-time check for directed structural balance)\nThere exists \u03c3\u2208{\u00b11}^V with [\u03c3]W[\u03c3]\u22650 iff the parity constraints \u03c3_i \u03c3_j = sgn(W_{ij}) are simultaneously satisfiable over the (undirected) constraint graph on V with an edge {i,j} for each directed arc (i,j). This can be checked by BFS/DFS in O(|V|+|E|): fix \u03c3 on one node per component, propagate constraints; any contradiction implies infeasibility.\nJustification. Feasibility is equivalent to making all transformed weights nonnegative, which is precisely the cycle-parity consistency condition; any directed cycle then has positive sign and vice versa.\n\nExamples\n- Functional positive cycle (UPA). 1\u21922\u21923\u21921 with W_{12}=2, W_{23}=3, W_{31}=5 (>0). For any f, choose \u03c3=+1; the cycle subgame is unsigned \u21d2 PNE exists; feedforward singletons choose BR to their unique successor; global PNE by SCC composition.\n- Robust nonexistence by Lemma A. On 1\u21922\u21923\u21921 choose W_{12}=L, W_{23}=L, W_{31}=\u2212L with L big; h=0; add arbitrary nonzero off-cycle edges. No PNE.\n\nObstacles\n- Beyond undirected/structurally balanced/functional SCCs, a full UPA characterization is open. Mixed asymmetric weights over multi-cycle SCCs can destroy UPA even if some cycles are positive.\n\nNext steps\n- Enlarge UPA classes: (i) SCCs switchable to monotone (all edges nonnegative after \u03c3) on a feedback edge set; (ii) identify polymatrix blocks admitting ordinal potentials (edge-symmetric sums). Prove PNE existence or give counterexamples.\n- Algorithmic pipeline (summary): (1) If DAG, construct PNE by backward pass. (2) Else, SCC-decompose. For each SCC U: test undirected (exact potential), structural balance via Lemma D, or functional-positive via Proposition B. If all SCCs pass, construct PNE by reverse topological order; else use cohesive-core criteria (from the paper) or output an obstruction (e.g., Lemma A).\n- Complexity: SCC decomposition O(|V|+|E|); each SCC test O(|U|+|E_U|); construction uses per-SCC solvers for unsigned (supermodular) or undirected (potential) subgames.\n\nClaims to add to proofs.md / output.md\n- Lemma A (dominant negative cycle obstruction) with proof.\n- Proposition B and Corollary C (functional UPA characterization and construction).\n- Lemma D (structural-balance linear-time check) with justification."
