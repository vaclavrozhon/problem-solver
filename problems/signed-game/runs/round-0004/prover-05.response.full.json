The proof suggests antisymmetric sign pairs create matching-pennies, but I wonder about the specifics. When all pairs are non-negative, the matrix will be sign-symmetric, though potential equality isn't guaranteed if only signs match. I\u2019m curious if sign-symmetric digons would be enough for UPA in every external field.",

For three players, even if the signs are symmetrical, the weights could be non-symmetrical, leading me to wonder if the game would still be UPA. I think there could be issues similar to matching pennies. If all edges are positive, they can be structured balanced, but if some pairs are negative, that might break balance.

Choose signs s_r\u2208{\u00b11} with \u220f_{r=1}^k s_r = \u22121 and set W_{i_r i_{r+1}}=s_r L, h=0. Let all other edges have arbitrary nonzero weights independent of L. If\\nL > 2 max_{r} \u2211_{j\u2260i_{r+1}} |W_{i_r j}|,\\nthen the SNC game has no pure NE.\\nProof. For each r, the BR condition at i_r is sign(h_{i_r}+\u2211_j W_{i_r j} x_j)=sign(s_r L x_{i_{r+1}}+\u03b7_r) with |\u03b7_r|<L/2, hence x_{i_r}=s_r x_{i_{r+1}} (unique). Composing along C yields x_{i_1}=(\u220f s_r) x_{i_1}=\u2212x_{i_1}, a contradiction. \u220e\\nCorollary. Any digraph with a directed cycle fails to uniformly guarantee PNE over all W,h (necessity direction for the \u201cuniform guarantee \u21d4 DAG\u201d). Lemma A is robust to extra neighbors and nonzero weights off-cycle.\\n\\nProposition B (Functional SCCs are UPA \u21d4 all cycle-signs positive)\\nAssume outdegree(i)\u22641 for all i. Each SCC U is either a singleton or a simple directed cycle C=(i_1\u2192\u22ef\u2192i_k\u2192i_1) with weights a_r=W_{i_r i_{r+1}}\u22600. Then the restricted subgame on U is universally PNE-admitting (for every external field f\u2208\u211d^U) iff \u220f_{r=1}^k sgn(a_r)=+1.\\nProof. If the product is \u22121, with f=0 BR constraints x_{i_r}=sgn(a_r) x_{i_{r+1}} are inconsistent. If +1, define \u03c3 by \u03c3_{i_{r+1}}=\u03c3_{i_r} sgn(a_r); consistency follows from the positive product. Then [\u03c3]W_{UU}[\u03c3] has all cycle entries |a_r|>0 (unsigned). For any f, the transformed restricted subgame is an unsigned network coordination game (supermodular), hence admits a PNE; mapping back by x=[\u03c3]y preserves PNE. \u220e\\nCorollary C (Functional digraphs with positive cycles \u21d2 existence and BR-path). If every SCC is functional and every directed cycle has positive sign, then for every h the game admits a PNE. Construct it SCC-wise in reverse topological order; concatenate within-SCC BR-paths to obtain a global BR-path.\\n\\nLemma D (Linear-time check for directed structural balance)\\nThere exists \u03c3\u2208{\u00b11}^V with [\u03c3]W[\u03c3]\u22650 iff the parity constraints \u03c3_i \u03c3_j = sgn(W_{ij}) are simultaneously satisfiable over the (undirected) constraint graph on V with an edge {i,j} for each directed arc (i,j). This can be checked by BFS/DFS in O(|V|+|E|): fix \u03c3 on one node per component, propagate constraints; any contradiction implies infeasibility.\\nJustification. Feasibility is equivalent to making all transformed weights nonnegative, which is precisely the cycle-parity consistency condition; any directed cycle then has positive sign and vice versa.\\n\\nExamples\\n- Functional positive cycle (UPA). 1\u21922\u21923\u21921 with W_{12}=2, W_{23}=3, W_{31}=5 (>0). For any f, choose \u03c3=+1; the cycle subgame is unsigned \u21d2 PNE exists; feedforward singletons choose BR to their unique successor; global PNE by SCC composition.\\n- Robust nonexistence by Lemma A. On 1\u21922\u21923\u21921 choose W_{12}=L, W_{23}=L, W_{31}=\u2212L with L big; h=0; add arbitrary nonzero off-cycle edges. No PNE.\\n\\nObstacles\\n- Beyond undirected/structurally balanced/functional SCCs, a full UPA characterization is open. Mixed asymmetric weights over multi-cycle SCCs can destroy UPA even if some cycles are positive.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Enlarge UPA classes: (i) SCCs switchable to monotone (all edges nonnegative after \u03c3) on a feedback edge set; (ii) identify polymatrix blocks admitting ordinal potentials (edge-symmetric sums). Prove PNE existence or give counterexamples.\\n- Algorithmic pipeline (summary): (1) If DAG, construct PNE by backward pass. (2) Else, SCC-decompose. For each SCC U: test undirected (exact potential), structural balance via Lemma D, or functional-positive via Proposition B. If all SCCs pass, construct PNE by reverse topological order; else use cohesive-core criteria (from the paper) or output an obstruction (e.g., Lemma A).\\n- Complexity: SCC decomposition O(|V|+|E|); each SCC test O(|U|+|E_U|); construction uses per-SCC solvers for unsigned (supermodular) or undirected (potential) subgames.\\n\\nClaims to add to proofs.md / output.md\\n- Lemma A (dominant negative cycle obstruction) with proof.\\n- Proposition B and Corollary C (functional UPA characterization and construction).\\n- Lemma D (structural-balance linear-time check) with justification.\"}",
