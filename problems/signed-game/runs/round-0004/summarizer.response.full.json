The earlier instructions had specified needing citations but the schema omitted them. I think we could potentially include citations within the `summary_md` or the `one_line_summary`. Maybe I could format them as a final line in `summary_md`, like \"Citations: papers/paper1.txt, proofs.md, output.md.\" It\u2019s important to ensure that `summary_md` stays concise, ideally around 120 words.",

More generally, SCC composition: if every SCC is universally PNE-admitting (UPA) under arbitrary external fields (examples: undirected SCCs, structurally balanced SCCs after a gauge, functional-cycle SCCs with positive sign product), then solve SCCs from sinks upward to construct a global PNE and BR-path. Added diagnostics and constructive criteria: two-node digon test (same-sign arcs), functional-digraph cycle-sign test, cohesive-core inequalities and weight-dominance, dominant-negative-cycle obstruction. Draft algorithmic pipeline and extra modules (multi-core cohesive existence, bounded-length monotone BR paths, forest corollary) were provided.
