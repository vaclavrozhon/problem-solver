{"summary_md":"This round establishes graph-level and modular guarantees for pure Nash equilibria (PNE) in binary signed-network coordination (SNC) games. Key results: a dependency digraph guarantees a PNE for every choice of W (zero-diagonal supported on that digraph) and h iff the digraph is acyclic (DAG) — sufficiency by backward induction, necessity via negative-product cycles that force inconsistent BR constraints. More generally, SCC composition: if every SCC is universally PNE-admitting (UPA) under arbitrary external fields (examples: undirected SCCs, structurally balanced SCCs after a gauge, functional-cycle SCCs with positive sign product), then solve SCCs from sinks upward to construct a global PNE and BR-path. Added diagnostics and constructive criteria: two-node digon test (same-sign arcs), functional-digraph cycle-sign test, cohesive-core inequalities and weight-dominance, dominant-negative-cycle obstruction. Draft algorithmic pipeline and extra modules (multi-core cohesive existence, bounded-length monotone BR paths, forest corollary) were provided.
