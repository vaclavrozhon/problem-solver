  "feedback_md": "Good progress and largely correct additions this round.\n\n1) Multi-core cohesive existence (Prover 1). The statement is a natural and valid generalization of the single-core cohesive result: partition V=R^1\u2294\u2026\u2294R^m\u2294S, with each block R^t internally unsigned after a signature \u03c4^(t) and satisfying w_i^{R^t}+\u03c4_i^{(t)}h_i \u2265 w_i^{V\\R^t} for all i\u2208R^t, plus existence of a PNE for the S-subgame with R frozen at \u03c4_R. The proof outline via a global gauge \u03c3 that fixes R to +1 and leaves S unchanged is right. Minor fixes: (i) when lower-bounding the best-response marginal in the transformed game, include all external influence V\\R^t (not only S): \u0394_i \u2265 2(h_i^{[\u03c3]}+\u2211_{j\u2208R^t}W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij}\u00b71 \u2212 |\u2211_{j\u2209R^t}W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij}x_j|) \u2265 2(h_i^{[\u03c3]}+w_i^{R^t} \u2212 w_i^{V\\R^t}) \u2265 0. (ii) Do not claim uniqueness of +1 as a best response unless the inequality is strict; ties can occur at equality. With these corrections, the theorem is sound.\n\n2) Monotone bounded-length BR-path (unsigned components). The lemma and its corollary (length \u2264 |U| within an unsigned block; total length \u2264 \u2211|U_k| under SCC composition after gauging each SCC to unsigned) are correct. This adds a useful constructive bound.\n\n3) Functional digraphs. Prior results remain valid; Prover 4\u2019s counting refinement is reasonable when all nodes on a cycle are responsive (|h_i|<|w_i|), but exact counting under ties depends on tie-breaking. State existence and the \u201ctwo PNE if all strict\u201d claim; treat counts under ties as lower bounds, not exact.\n\n4) Forests with sign-symmetric digons. The class is correctly identified as PNE-guaranteeing for all h via SCC composition and the 2-node UPA classification. Worth adding as a corollary.\n\n5) Structural balance check and dominant negative cycle. The directed cycle-parity characterization and linear-time labeling are correct; the dominant negative cycle obstruction is robust and correctly stated.\n\nExplicit next steps: (i) Formalize the multi-core proof with the corrected inequality and non-uniqueness remark; (ii) Integrate the monotone BR path bound into the SCC pipeline (produce explicit BR paths and length bounds after gauging); (iii) Develop further UPA SCC families beyond undirected/structurally balanced/functional (e.g., ordinal-potential polymatrix blocks); (iv) Implement the end-to-end checker: SCCs, per-SCC tests (symmetry/structural balance/functional-positive), dominance obstructions, cohesive-core fallback, and explicit BR-path construction when applicable.",

    "content": "Theorem (Multi-core cohesive existence).\nLet V=R^1\u2294\u22ef\u2294R^m\u2294S. For each t, suppose there exists \u03c4^{(t)}\u2208{\u00b11}^{R^t} such that (i) G_{R^t}^{[\u03c4^{(t)}]} is unsigned (i.e., \u03c4_i^{(t)} W_{ij} \u03c4_j^{(t)} \u2265 0 for i,j\u2208R^t), and (ii) w_i^{R^t} + \u03c4_i^{(t)} h_i \u2265 w_i^{V\\R^t} for all i\u2208R^t. Let \u03c4_R be the concatenation of \u03c4^{(t)} and assume the S-restricted game with R frozen at \u03c4_R admits a PNE z^*. Then the full game admits a PNE x^* with x^*_{R^t}=\u03c4^{(t)} for all t and x^*_S=z^*.\nProof. Define \u03c3 by \u03c3_i=\u03c4_i^{(t)} if i\u2208R^t and \u03c3_i=1 if i\u2208S. Consider the [\u03c3]-transformed game; h_i^{[\u03c3]}=\u03c3_i h_i and (W_{R^t R^t})^{[\u03c3]}\u22650 for each t. By the hypothesis on S, z^* is a PNE of the S-restricted transformed game with R fixed at 1_R. For i\u2208R^t, with x_R=1_R and x_S=z^*, the best-response marginal is\n\u0394_i = 2(h_i^{[\u03c3]} + \u2211_{j\u2208R^t} W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij}\u00b71 + \u2211_{j\u2209R^t} W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij} x_j).\nSince W^{[\u03c3]}_{R^t R^t}\u22650, the internal sum equals \u2211_{j\u2208R^t} W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij} = \u2211_{j\u2208R^t} |W_{ij}| = w_i^{R^t}. Moreover |\u2211_{j\u2209R^t} W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij} x_j| \u2264 \u2211_{j\u2209R^t} |W_{ij}| = w_i^{V\\R^t}. Hence \u0394_i \u2265 2(h_i^{[\u03c3]} + w_i^{R^t} \u2212 w_i^{V\\R^t}) \u2265 0 by (ii). Thus +1\u2208B_i in the transformed game for all i\u2208R^t. Since z^* is a PNE on S under 1_R, x\u0303^*=(1_R,z^*) is a PNE of the transformed game. Mapping back via x^*=[\u03c3]x\u0303^* gives a PNE with the stated coordinates. \u220e\n\nLemma (Monotone bounded-length BR-path in unsigned subgames).\nLet U\u2286V and suppose W_{ij}\u22650 for all i,j\u2208U; fix any external field f\u2208\u211d^U. There is a BR-path from \u22121_U to a PNE of the U-restricted game of length \u2264|U|, monotone nondecreasing coordinatewise.\nProof. Define \u0394_i(x)=2(f_i+\u2211_{j\u2208U} W_{ij}x_j), which is nondecreasing in x when W\u22650. Starting at y^{(0)}=\u22121_U, while some \u0394_i(y^{(k)})>0, flip i to +1 to obtain y^{(k+1)}. Monotonicity implies coordinates never flip back, so after at most |U| flips no \u0394_i>0 remains. At termination, any i with y_i=+1 has \u0394_i\u22650 and any with y_i=\u22121 has \u0394_i\u22640, so y is a PNE. Each step is a best response. \u220e\n\nCorollary (BR-path length bound under SCC composition with unsigned SCCs).\nLet U_1,\u2026,U_m be SCCs in reverse topological order of the condensation DAG. Suppose for each k there exists \u03c3^{(k)} with (W_{U_k U_k})^{[\u03c3^{(k)}]}\u22650 (e.g., U_k structurally balanced). Fix h. Sequentially gauge each U_k and apply the lemma to find a BR-path within U_k (with external fields induced by later SCCs) of length \u2264|U_k|. Concatenating yields a BR-path to a global PNE of total length \u2264\u2211_k |U_k|. \u220e"

If the underlying undirected graph is a forest and, for every undirected edge {i,j}, either exactly one arc exists or both arcs exist with the same sign (sgn(W_{ij})=sgn(W_{ji})), then for any h the game admits a PNE, and a BR-path to it exists.\nProof. Each SCC is either a singleton or a 2-node digon. Singletons are trivial; a 2-node digon with same-sign arcs satisfies W_{12}W_{21}\u22650 and is universally PNE-admitting (after a signature, the 2-player subgame is unsigned and supermodular). Contracting SCCs yields a DAG; by SCC composition (item 2), selecting per-SCC PNEs in reverse topological order gives a global PNE and a BR-path."
