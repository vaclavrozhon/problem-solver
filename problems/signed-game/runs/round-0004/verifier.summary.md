Validated: (a) multi-core cohesive existence (with minor proof corrections), (b) bounded-length monotone BR paths in unsigned (and gauged) SCCs, (c) forests with sign-symmetric digons ⇒ PNE via SCC composition, (d) structural-balance parity checker and dominant negative cycle obstruction. We added rigorous proofs for (a) and (b) to proofs.md and a concise forest corollary to output.md. Next: characterize further UPA SCCs and implement the full checker/constructor pipeline.
