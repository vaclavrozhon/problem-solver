{"feedback_md":"Good progress and largely correct additions this round.\n\n1) Multi-core cohesive existence (Prover 1). The statement is a natural and valid generalization of the single-core cohesive result: partition V=R^1⊔…⊔R^m⊔S, with each block R^t internally unsigned after a signature τ^(t) and satisfying w_i^{R^t}+τ_i^{(t)}h_i ≥ w_i^{V\\R^t} for all i∈R^t, plus existence of a PNE for the S-subgame with R frozen at τ_R. The proof outline via a global gauge σ that fixes R to +1 and leaves S unchanged is right. Minor fixes: (i) when lower-bounding the best-response marginal in the transformed game, include all external influence V\\R^t (not only S): Δ_i ≥ 2(h_i^{[σ]}+∑_{j∈R^t}W^{[σ]}_{ij}·1 − |∑_{j∉R^t}W^{[σ]}_{ij}x_j|) ≥ 2(h_i^{[σ]}+w_i^{R^t} − w_i^{V\\R^t}) ≥ 0. (ii) Do not claim uniqueness of +1 as a best response unless the inequality is strict; ties can occur at equality. With these corrections, the theorem is sound.\n\n2) Monotone bounded-length BR-path (unsigned components). The lemma and its corollary (length ≤ |U| within an unsigned block; total length ≤ ∑|U_k| under SCC composition after gauging each SCC to unsigned) are correct. This adds a useful constructive bound.\n\n3) Functional digraphs. Prior results remain valid; Prover 4’s counting refinement is reasonable when all nodes on a cycle are responsive (|h_i|<|w_i|), but exact counting under ties depends on tie-breaking. State existence and the “two PNE if all strict” claim; treat counts under ties as lower bounds, not exact.\n\n4) Forests with sign-symmetric digons. The class is correctly identified as PNE-guaranteeing for all h via SCC composition and the 2-node UPA classification. Worth adding as a corollary.\n\n5) Structural balance check and dominant negative cycle. The directed cycle-parity characterization and linear-time labeling are correct; the dominant negative cycle obstruction is robust and correctly stated.\n\nExplicit next steps: (i) Formalize the multi-core proof with the corrected inequality and non-uniqueness remark; (ii) Integrate the monotone BR path bound into the SCC pipeline (produce explicit BR paths and length bounds after gauging); (iii) Develop further UPA SCC families beyond undirected/structurally balanced/functional (e.g., ordinal-potential polymatrix blocks); (iv) Implement the end-to-end checker: SCCs, per-SCC tests (symmetry/structural balance/functional-positive), dominance obstructions, cohesive-core fallback, and explicit BR-path construction when applicable.","summary_md":"Validated: (a) multi-core cohesive existence (with minor proof corrections), (b) bounded-length monotone BR paths in unsigned (and gauged) SCCs, (c) forests with sign-symmetric digons ⇒ PNE via SCC composition, (d) structural-balance parity checker and dominant negative cycle obstruction.

If the S-restricted game with R frozen at τ_R admits a PNE, then the full game has a PNE with x_{R^t}=τ^{(t)} for all t.

For each t, suppose there exists τ^{(t)}∈{±1}^{R^t} such that (i) G_{R^t}^{[τ^{(t)}]} is unsigned (i.e., τ_i^{(t)} W_{ij} τ_j^{(t)} ≥ 0 for i,j∈R^t), and (ii) w_i^{R^t} + τ_i^{(t)} h_i ≥ w_i^{V\\R^t} for all i∈R^t. Let τ_R be the concatenation of τ^{(t)} and assume the S-restricted game with R frozen at τ_R admits a PNE z^*. Then the full game admits a PNE x^* with x^*_{R^t}=τ^{(t)} for all t and x^*_S=z^*.\nProof. Define σ by σ_i=τ_i^{(t)} if i∈R^t and σ_i=1 if i∈S. Consider the [σ]-transformed game; h_i^{[σ]}=σ_i h_i and (W_{R^t R^t})^{[σ]}≥0 for each t. By the hypothesis on S, z^* is a PNE of the S-restricted transformed game with R fixed at 1_R. For i∈R^t, with x_R=1_R and x_S=z^*, the best-response marginal is\nΔ_i = 2(h_i^{[σ]} + ∑_{j∈R^t} W^{[σ]}_{ij}·1 + ∑_{j∉R^t} W^{[σ]}_{ij} x_j).\nSince W^{[σ]}_{R^t R^t}≥0, the internal sum equals ∑_{j∈R^t} W^{[σ]}_{ij} = ∑_{j∈R^t} |W_{ij}| = w_i^{R^t}. Moreover |∑_{j∉R^t} W^{[σ]}_{ij} x_j| ≤ ∑_{j∉R^t} |W_{ij}| = w_i^{V\\R^t}. Hence Δ_i ≥ 2(h_i^{[σ]} + w_i^{R^t} − w_i^{V\\R^t}) ≥ 0 by (ii). Thus +1∈B_i in the transformed game for all i∈R^t. Since z^* is a PNE on S under 1_R, x̃^*=(1_R,z^*) is a PNE of the transformed game. Mapping back via x^*=[σ]x̃^* gives a PNE with the stated coordinates. ∎\n\nLemma (Monotone bounded-length BR-path in unsigned subgames).\nLet U⊆V and suppose W_{ij}≥0 for all i,j∈U; fix any external field f∈ℝ^U. There is a BR-path from −1_U to a PNE of the U-restricted game of length ≤|U|, monotone nondecreasing coordinatewise.\nProof. Define Δ_i(x)=2(f_i+∑_{j∈U} W_{ij}x_j), which is nondecreasing in x when W≥0. Starting at y^{(0)}=−1_U, while some Δ_i(y^{(k)})>0, flip i to +1 to obtain y^{(k+1)}. Monotonicity implies coordinates never flip back, so after at most |U| flips no Δ_i>0 remains. At termination, any i with y_i=+1 has Δ_i≥0 and any with y_i=−1 has Δ_i≤0, so y is a PNE. Each step is a best response. ∎\n\nCorollary (BR-path length bound under SCC composition with unsigned SCCs).\nLet U_1,…,U_m be SCCs in reverse topological order of the condensation DAG. Suppose for each k there exists σ^{(k)} with (W_{U_k U_k})^{[σ^{(k)}]}≥0 (e.g., U_k structurally balanced). Fix h. Sequentially gauge each U_k and apply the lemma to find a BR-path within U_k (with external fields induced by later SCCs) of length ≤|U_k|. Concatenating yields a BR-path to a global PNE of total length ≤∑_k |U_k|. ∎"},"output_update":{"action":"append","content":"5) Forests with sign-symmetric digons\nCorollary. If the underlying undirected graph is a forest and, for every undirected edge {i,j}, either exactly one arc exists or both arcs exist with the same sign (sgn(W_{ij})=sgn(W_{ji})), then for any h the game admits a PNE, and a BR-path to it exists.\nProof. Each SCC is either a singleton or a 2-node digon. Singletons are trivial; a 2-node digon with same-sign arcs satisfies W_{12}W_{21}≥0 and is universally PNE-admitting (after a signature, the 2-player subgame is unsigned and supermodular). Contracting SCCs yields a DAG; by SCC composition (item 2), selecting per-SCC PNEs in reverse topological order gives a global PNE and a BR-path."}}
