For unsigned, I plan to use a monotone BR procedure. Then for cycles, I'll apply structural balance to evaluate the unsigned cases. I also need to establish a BR-path length bound. Finally, my next step is to craft the JSON to represent this data effectively. Let's get to it!",

This gives constructive algorithms and verifiable path lengths.\\n- Add a simple new corollary class: forests with sign-symmetric digons; prove existence by SCC composition (singletons and 2-node same-sign digons are UPA).\\n- Sketch an end-to-end algorithmic checker with complexity; includes parity-based structural-balance test and the monotone BR construction.\\n\\nTheorem (multi-core cohesive existence; corrected)\\nLet V=R^1 \u2294 \u2026 \u2294 R^m \u2294 S be a partition. For each block R^t, assume there exists \u03c4^{(t)}\u2208{\u00b11}^{R^t} such that:\\n(i) \u03c4_i^{(t)} W_{ij} \u03c4_j^{(t)} \u2265 0 for all i,j\u2208R^t (equivalently, G_{R^t}^{[\u03c4^{(t)}]} is unsigned);\\n(ii) w_i^{R^t} + \u03c4_i^{(t)} h_i \u2265 w_i^{V\\\\R^t} for all i\u2208R^t, where w_i^A=\u2211_{j\u2208A}|W_{ij}|.\\nLet \u03c4_R be the concatenation of \u03c4^{(1)},\u2026,\u03c4^{(m)} on R:=\u2294_t R^t. Assume the S-restricted game with R frozen at \u03c4_R admits a PNE z^*\u2208{\u00b11}^S (e.g., if G_S is undirected or structurally balanced). Then the full game admits a PNE x^* with x^*_{R^t}=\u03c4^{(t)} for all t and x^*_S=z^*.\\nProof. Define \u03c3\u2208{\u00b11}^V by \u03c3_i=\u03c4_i^{(t)} on R^t and \u03c3_i=1 on S. In the [\u03c3]-transformed game, each G_{R^t}^{[\u03c3]} is unsigned and h_i^{[\u03c3]}=\u03c3_i h_i=\u03c4_i^{(t)}h_i on R^t. By assumption, z^* is a PNE for the S-restricted transformed game with R frozen at 1_R (since u_i^{[\u03c3]}(1_R,z)=u_i(\u03c4_R,z) on S). For i\u2208R^t, with (x_R,z)=(1_R,z^*), the marginal is \u0394_i^{[\u03c3]}=2( h_i^{[\u03c3]} + \u2211_{j\u2208R^t}W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij}\u00b71 + \u2211_{j\u2209R^t} W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij} x_j ). Using W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij}\u22650 on R^t and |\u2211_{j\u2209R^t}W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij} x_j| \u2264 \u2211_{j\u2209R^t}|W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij}|=w_i^{V\\\\R^t}, we get\\n\u0394_i^{[\u03c3]} \u2265 2( h_i^{[\u03c3]} + \u2211_{j\u2208R^t} W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij} \u2212 w_i^{V\\\\R^t} ) = 2( \u03c4_i^{(t)}h_i + w_i^{R^t} \u2212 w_i^{V\\\\R^t} ) \u2265 0.\\nHence +1 is a best response (not necessarily unique at equality) for every i\u2208R^t, so x\u0303^*=(1_R,z^*) is a PNE for the transformed game. Mapping back x^*=[\u03c3]x\u0303^* is a PNE in the original game with x^*_{R^t}=\u03c4^{(t)} and x^*_S=z^*. \u220e\\nRemarks. (a) This reduces to the single-core theorem for m=1. (b) S-restricted existence holds if G_S is undirected (potential) or structurally balanced (switch to unsigned). (c) If some inequalities are strict, the block\u2019s action is uniquely best (but uniqueness is not required).\\n\\nLemma (monotone, bounded-length BR path on unsigned components)\\nLet U\u2286V and suppose W_{ij}\u22650 for all i,j\u2208U (unsigned). For any external field f\u2208\u211d^U, there exists a BR path from \u22121_U to a PNE of the U-restricted game of length at most |U|, with monotone coordinate updates (each player flips at most once, from \u22121 to +1).\\nProof. The marginal \u0394_i(x)=2(f_i+\u2211_{j\u2208U}W_{ij}x_j) is nondecreasing in x when W\u22650. Starting at y^{(0)}=\u22121_U, iteratively flip any i with \u0394_i(y^{(k)})>0. Monotonicity implies \u0394_i never turns negative for flipped i, hence no reversals. Termination occurs in \u2264|U| steps; at termination \u0394_i\u22640 for i with action \u22121 and \u0394_i\u22650 for action +1, so y^{(\u2113)} is a PNE. Each step is a best-response flip. \u220e\\n\\nCorollary (SCC-composed BR-path length bound under unsigned-after-switching SCCs)\\nLet U_1,\u2026,U_m be SCCs in a condensation DAG order and suppose for each k there exists a signature \u03c3^{(k)} with (W_{U_kU_k})^{[\u03c3^{(k)}]}\u22650 (e.g., U_k is structurally balanced). Then, for any h, there is a BR path to a global PNE of length \u2264\u2211_k |U_k|: process SCCs in reverse topological order, gauge U_k, apply the monotone lemma within U_k (using external field induced by already-fixed later SCCs), and concatenate the within-SCC paths.\\n\\nCorollary (forests with sign-symmetric digons)\\nLet the underlying undirected graph be a forest. For every undirected edge {i,j}, assume either exactly one arc exists or both arcs exist with the same sign (sgn(W_{ij})=sgn(W_{ji})). Then, for any h, the game admits a PNE and a BR path to it.\\nProof. Each SCC is either a singleton or a 2-node digon. Singletons are trivial; a 2-node digon with W_{12}W_{21}\u22650 is UPA (after \u03c3 it is unsigned, so supermodular for any external field). Contracting SCCs yields a DAG; select PNEs per SCC in reverse order by SCC composition. Concatenating BR paths inside each SCC yields a global BR path. \u220e\\n\\nAlgorithmic pipeline (checker and constructor)\\n- Input: W (zero diagonal), h.\\n1) If the dependency digraph is a DAG, compute a PNE by backward induction in O(|V|+|E|).\\n2) Else, compute SCCs (Tarjan/Kosaraju). For each SCC U:\\n   (a) If W_{UU} is symmetric \u21d2 exact potential; use local improvement to find a PNE (finite termination).\\n   (b) Else test structural balance on U: solve parity labels for \u03c3 with constraints \u03c3_i\u03c3_j=sgn(W_{ij}) (BFS/UF with parity) in O(|U|+|E_U|). If feasible, gauge to unsigned and use the monotone lemma to build a PNE and a BR path of length \u2264|U|.\\n   (c) Else, if functional (outdegree \u22641 on U) and every directed cycle has positive sign product \u21d2 UPA; construct a PNE (e.g., via switching to unsigned on cycles and greedy on trees).\\n   (d) Else, attempt cohesive-core decomposition inside U (as per theorems above) or report obstruction diagnostics (e.g., dominant negative cycles).\\n3) If all SCCs pass (a,b,c or a provable d), assemble a global PNE in reverse topological order; concatenate within-SCC BR paths; total BR steps \u2264\u2211|U_k| when all SCCs are unsigned after switching.\\n\\nExamples\\n- Two cohesive blocks. Let R^1,R^2 disjoint, with W_{ij}\u22650 on each and S undirected. If \u03c4^{(1)}=1 on R^1 and \u03c4^{(2)}=\u22121 on R^2, and w_i^{R^1}+h_i \u2265 w_i^{V\\\\R^1} for i\u2208R^1 and w_i^{R^2}\u2212h_i \u2265 w_i^{V\\\\R^2} for i\u2208R^2, and the S-subgame (R frozen) has a PNE, then the full game has a PNE with x_{R^1}=1, x_{R^2}=\u22121.\\n- Forest with a digon. A path 1\u20142\u20143\u20144 with arcs 1\u21922,2\u21921 both positive, and single arcs 2\u21923, 4\u21923; every SCC is a singleton or the {1,2} digon; by the corollary, a PNE exists for any h, computable in linear time.\\n\\nObstacles\\n- Beyond unsigned-after-switching and exact-potential SCCs, a full UPA classification is open. Negative cycles that are not dominant do not necessarily preclude PNE for fixed W over all external fields.\\n- Counting equilibria under ties depends on tie-breaking; we avoid exact counts, focusing on existence and path bounds.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Extend UPA families (e.g., ordinal-potential polymatrix blocks) and integrate into the SCC pipeline.\\n- Strengthen cohesive-core tools (hierarchical cores) and combine with SCC decomposition.\\n- Implement the checker with explicit BR-path construction and empirical tests on random instances; measure path lengths against the \u2211|U_k| bound where applicable.\"}",
