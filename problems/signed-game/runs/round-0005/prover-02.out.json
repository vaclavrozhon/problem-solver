Let V=R^1\u2294\u22ef\u2294R^m\u2294S be a partition. For each block R^t, suppose there exists \u03c4^(t)\u2208{\u00b11}^{R^t} such that W^{[\u03c4^(t)]}_{R^t,R^t}\u22650 (i.e., G_{R^t}^{[\u03c4^(t)]} is unsigned) and, for every i\u2208R^t,\n(1)  w_i^{R^t} + \u03c4_i^(t) h_i \u2265 w_i^{V\\R^t}.\nLet \u03c4_R be the concatenation of the \u03c4^(t) on R. Assume that the S-restricted subgame with R frozen at \u03c4_R admits a PNE (e.g., G_S is undirected or structurally balanced). Then the full game admits a PNE x* with x*_{R^t}=\u03c4^(t) for all t.\nProof. Define \u03c3\u2208{\u00b11}^V by \u03c3_i=\u03c4_i^(t) for i\u2208R^t, and \u03c3_i=1 for i\u2208S. Consider the [\u03c3]-transformed game (same best responses up to \u03c3-mapping). For i\u2208R^t, the transformed marginal at action +1 versus \u22121 is\n\u0394_i(x)=2(h_i^{[\u03c3]} + \u2211_{j\u2208R^t} W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij} x_j + \u2211_{j\u2209R^t} W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij} x_j).\nSince W^{[\u03c3]}_{R^t,R^t}\u22650 and we target x_{R^t}=1, we bound adversarial influence from outside R^t by absolute sum:\n\u0394_i(x) \u2265 2(h_i^{[\u03c3]} + \u2211_{j\u2208R^t} W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij}\u00b71 \u2212 |\u2211_{j\u2209R^t} W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij} x_j|) \u2265 2(\u03c4_i^(t) h_i + w_i^{R^t} \u2212 w_i^{V\\R^t}).\nBy (1), \u0394_i(x)\u22650 for all x, hence +1 is a (weak) best response for every i\u2208R^t whenever x_{R^t}=1. Let z* be a PNE of the S-restricted game with R frozen to \u03c4_R (existence by hypothesis). Then in the transformed game, (1_R, z*) is a PNE: S-players are best-responding by construction; R-players have (weak) best responses at +1 by \u0394_i\u22650. Mapping back yields x*=[\u03c3](1_R, z*) with x*_{R^t}=\u03c4^(t), which is a PNE of the original game. Note ties may occur at equality in (1); uniqueness of +1 is not claimed nor needed. \u220e\n\nDirected structural balance: linear-time test (for SCCs)\nLemma (Cycle-parity \u21d4 gauge to unsigned; O(|U|+|E_U|) test). For an SCC U, the following are equivalent: (i) \u2203\u03c3\u2208{\u00b11}^U with [\u03c3]W_{UU}[\u03c3]\u22650; (ii) every directed cycle in U has positive sign product. Proof: (i)\u21d2(ii) immediate by multiplying \u03c3 along cycles; (ii)\u21d2(i) define \u03c3 by \u03c3_r=1 at a root r and propagate \u03c3_j:=\u03c3_i\u00b7sgn(W_{ij}) along any path; well-definedness follows from (ii). An O(|U|+|E_U|) BFS/DFS detects contradictions (negative directed cycles) as label conflicts and otherwise recovers \u03c3.\n\nMonotone BR paths and length bounds in unsigned blocks\nLemma (Unsigned block BR bound). In an unsigned game on U, starting from \u22121_U, sequentially flip any i with positive marginal \u03b4_i(x)=u_i(+1,x_{\u2212i})\u2212u_i(\u22121,x_{\u2212i}). Each flip strictly increases \u2211_i u_i(x) (or the standard potential), hence within at most |U| flips we reach a PNE on U. Under SCC composition, after gauging each U_k to unsigned (when structurally balanced), concatenating per-SCC monotone paths (from sinks upward) yields a global BR-path of length \u2264\u2211_k |U_k|.\n\nForest with sign-symmetric digons (polished corollary)\nCorollary. If the undirected support is a forest and for every undirected edge {i,j} either: (a) exactly one arc exists; or (b) both arcs exist with sgn(W_{ij})=sgn(W_{ji}), then for any h, a PNE exists and a BR-path to it can be constructed. Proof: SCCs are singletons or 2-node digons; by the 2-node UPA lemma (W_{12}W_{21}\u22650), each SCC is UPA; compose by SCC-DAG.\n\nRobust obstruction (for diagnostics)\nLemma (Dominant negative cycle \u21d2 no PNE). If C is a directed simple cycle with sign product \u22121 and for each i on C, |W_{i,s(i)}| > |h_i| + \u2211_{j\u2260s(i)}|W_{ij}|, then the game has no PNE (cycle forces contradictory BR constraints).\n\nAlgorithmic pipeline (checker/constructor; polynomial time)\n- Step 0: Decompose G into SCCs (Tarjan/Kosaraju; O(|V|+|E|)).\n- Step 1 (per SCC U):\n  (1a) If W_{UU} is symmetric \u21d2 exact potential \u21d2 mark U as UPA and store potential ascent BR path (\u2264|U| flips).\n  (1b) Else run the structural-balance test (Lemma) \u21d2 if positive, record \u03c3_U and mark U as UPA; store monotone BR path length \u2264|U| in the gauged block.\n  (1c) Else if |U|=2 and W_{12}W_{21}\u22650 \u21d2 UPA (2-node lemma).\n  (1d) Else if U is functional (outdegree\u22641 internally) and every directed cycle has positive sign \u21d2 UPA (functional-cycle theorem).\n  (1e) Else, attempt multi-core cohesive construction on detected unsigned subblocks R^t (Theorem) with S=U\\\u22c3R^t; if S-subgame is undirected or structurally balanced, mark solvable; else continue.\n  (1f) Else, run dominant negative cycle search; if found with sufficient margins \u21d2 report obstruction (no PNE for this instance).\n- Step 2: If all SCCs marked UPA/solvable, contract SCC-DAG and solve from sinks upward: in each U, treat downstream choices as external field; invoke stored solver to produce a PNE x^*_U; concatenate BR paths; global length bound \u2264\u2211_U |U|.\n- Complexity: O(|V|+|E|) for SCC/label tests; per-SCC solver is linear-time path for unsigned/structurally balanced via monotone flips; overall polynomial.\n\nExamples (for verification)\n- Multi-core cohesive: Let R^1={1,2}, W_{12}=W_{21}=1, h|_{R^1}=(0,0); R^2={3,4}, W_{34}=2,W_{43}=1, h|_{R^2}=(1,0); S={5}, no internal edges. Cross-block weights satisfy w_i^{R^t} + \u03c4_i^(t) h_i \u2265 w_i^{V\\R^t} with \u03c4^(1)=(1,1), \u03c4^(2)=(1,1). S-subgame (singleton) trivially has a PNE. The theorem yields a PNE with x_{R^1}=(1,1), x_{R^2}=(1,1).\n- Structural-balance test: U is a 4-cycle with signs (+,\u2212,\u2212,+); labeling recovers \u03c3 making all edges nonnegative; solver flips at most 4 nodes to reach a PNE.\n\nObstacles\n- UPA characterization of general (nonfunctional, chorded) SCCs remains open beyond undirected/structurally balanced cases; negative directed cycles alone do not preclude PNE unless augmented with margin/structure (dominance).\n- Multi-core approach requires an S-subgame PNE under the frozen core; our sufficient conditions (undirected/structurally balanced S) are not necessary; refining these would enlarge applicability.\n\nNext steps\n- Broaden UPA families: explore exact/ordinal potential polymatrix blocks beyond symmetry; identify minimal forbidden signed substructures for UPA.\n- Tighten cohesive criteria (only boundary nodes of each core need the inequality); quantify tolerance to small violations.\n- Implement the pipeline; empirically test on random signed graphs; measure success/failure rates and BR-path lengths."
