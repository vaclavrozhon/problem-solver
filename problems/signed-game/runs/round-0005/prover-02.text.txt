Ideas
- Formalize and prove a multi-core cohesive existence theorem (generalizing the single-core result) with the corrected marginal inequality and an explicit comment on non-uniqueness (ties).
- Provide a linear-time structural-balance checker for directed SCCs (cycle-parity/label propagation) with correctness justification under our directed convention i→j iff W_ij≠0.
- Give a constructive BR-path length bound when SCCs are gauged to unsigned (supermodular blocks), integrating with SCC composition.
- Package these into an explicit polynomial-time pipeline that either constructs a PNE and a BR-path or returns an obstruction (dominant negative cycle).

Multi-core cohesive existence (precise statement and proof)
Theorem (Multi-core cohesive existence). Let V=R^1⊔⋯⊔R^m⊔S be a partition. For each block R^t, suppose there exists τ^(t)∈{±1}^{R^t} such that W^{[τ^(t)]}_{R^t,R^t}≥0 (i.e., G_{R^t}^{[τ^(t)]} is unsigned) and, for every i∈R^t,
(1)  w_i^{R^t} + τ_i^(t) h_i ≥ w_i^{V\R^t}.
Let τ_R be the concatenation of the τ^(t) on R. Assume that the S-restricted subgame with R frozen at τ_R admits a PNE (e.g., G_S is undirected or structurally balanced). Then the full game admits a PNE x* with x*_{R^t}=τ^(t) for all t.
Proof. Define σ∈{±1}^V by σ_i=τ_i^(t) for i∈R^t, and σ_i=1 for i∈S. Consider the [σ]-transformed game (same best responses up to σ-mapping). For i∈R^t, the transformed marginal at action +1 versus −1 is
Δ_i(x)=2(h_i^{[σ]} + ∑_{j∈R^t} W^{[σ]}_{ij} x_j + ∑_{j∉R^t} W^{[σ]}_{ij} x_j).
Since W^{[σ]}_{R^t,R^t}≥0 and we target x_{R^t}=1, we bound adversarial influence from outside R^t by absolute sum:
Δ_i(x) ≥ 2(h_i^{[σ]} + ∑_{j∈R^t} W^{[σ]}_{ij}·1 − |∑_{j∉R^t} W^{[σ]}_{ij} x_j|) ≥ 2(τ_i^(t) h_i + w_i^{R^t} − w_i^{V\R^t}).
By (1), Δ_i(x)≥0 for all x, hence +1 is a (weak) best response for every i∈R^t whenever x_{R^t}=1. Let z* be a PNE of the S-restricted game with R frozen to τ_R (existence by hypothesis). Then in the transformed game, (1_R, z*) is a PNE: S-players are best-responding by construction; R-players have (weak) best responses at +1 by Δ_i≥0. Mapping back yields x*=[σ](1_R, z*) with x*_{R^t}=τ^(t), which is a PNE of the original game. Note ties may occur at equality in (1); uniqueness of +1 is not claimed nor needed. ∎

Directed structural balance: linear-time test (for SCCs)
Lemma (Cycle-parity ⇔ gauge to unsigned; O(|U|+|E_U|) test). For an SCC U, the following are equivalent: (i) ∃σ∈{±1}^U with [σ]W_{UU}[σ]≥0; (ii) every directed cycle in U has positive sign product. Proof: (i)⇒(ii) immediate by multiplying σ along cycles; (ii)⇒(i) define σ by σ_r=1 at a root r and propagate σ_j:=σ_i·sgn(W_{ij}) along any path; well-definedness follows from (ii). An O(|U|+|E_U|) BFS/DFS detects contradictions (negative directed cycles) as label conflicts and otherwise recovers σ.

Monotone BR paths and length bounds in unsigned blocks
Lemma (Unsigned block BR bound). In an unsigned game on U, starting from −1_U, sequentially flip any i with positive marginal δ_i(x)=u_i(+1,x_{−i})−u_i(−1,x_{−i}). Each flip strictly increases ∑_i u_i(x) (or the standard potential), hence within at most |U| flips we reach a PNE on U. Under SCC composition, after gauging each U_k to unsigned (when structurally balanced), concatenating per-SCC monotone paths (from sinks upward) yields a global BR-path of length ≤∑_k |U_k|.

Forest with sign-symmetric digons (polished corollary)
Corollary. If the undirected support is a forest and for every undirected edge {i,j} either: (a) exactly one arc exists; or (b) both arcs exist with sgn(W_{ij})=sgn(W_{ji}), then for any h, a PNE exists and a BR-path to it can be constructed. Proof: SCCs are singletons or 2-node digons; by the 2-node UPA lemma (W_{12}W_{21}≥0), each SCC is UPA; compose by SCC-DAG.

Robust obstruction (for diagnostics)
Lemma (Dominant negative cycle ⇒ no PNE). If C is a directed simple cycle with sign product −1 and for each i on C, |W_{i,s(i)}| > |h_i| + ∑_{j≠s(i)}|W_{ij}|, then the game has no PNE (cycle forces contradictory BR constraints).

Algorithmic pipeline (checker/constructor; polynomial time)
- Step 0: Decompose G into SCCs (Tarjan/Kosaraju; O(|V|+|E|)).
- Step 1 (per SCC U):
  (1a) If W_{UU} is symmetric ⇒ exact potential ⇒ mark U as UPA and store potential ascent BR path (≤|U| flips).
  (1b) Else run the structural-balance test (Lemma) ⇒ if positive, record σ_U and mark U as UPA; store monotone BR path length ≤|U| in the gauged block.
  (1c) Else if |U|=2 and W_{12}W_{21}≥0 ⇒ UPA (2-node lemma).
  (1d) Else if U is functional (outdegree≤1 internally) and every directed cycle has positive sign ⇒ UPA (functional-cycle theorem).
  (1e) Else, attempt multi-core cohesive construction on detected unsigned subblocks R^t (Theorem) with S=U\⋃R^t; if S-subgame is undirected or structurally balanced, mark solvable; else continue.
  (1f) Else, run dominant negative cycle search; if found with sufficient margins ⇒ report obstruction (no PNE for this instance).
- Step 2: If all SCCs marked UPA/solvable, contract SCC-DAG and solve from sinks upward: in each U, treat downstream choices as external field; invoke stored solver to produce a PNE x^*_U; concatenate BR paths; global length bound ≤∑_U |U|.
- Complexity: O(|V|+|E|) for SCC/label tests; per-SCC solver is linear-time path for unsigned/structurally balanced via monotone flips; overall polynomial.

Examples (for verification)
- Multi-core cohesive: Let R^1={1,2}, W_{12}=W_{21}=1, h|_{R^1}=(0,0); R^2={3,4}, W_{34}=2,W_{43}=1, h|_{R^2}=(1,0); S={5}, no internal edges. Cross-block weights satisfy w_i^{R^t} + τ_i^(t) h_i ≥ w_i^{V\R^t} with τ^(1)=(1,1), τ^(2)=(1,1). S-subgame (singleton) trivially has a PNE. The theorem yields a PNE with x_{R^1}=(1,1), x_{R^2}=(1,1).
- Structural-balance test: U is a 4-cycle with signs (+,−,−,+); labeling recovers σ making all edges nonnegative; solver flips at most 4 nodes to reach a PNE.

Obstacles
- UPA characterization of general (nonfunctional, chorded) SCCs remains open beyond undirected/structurally balanced cases; negative directed cycles alone do not preclude PNE unless augmented with margin/structure (dominance).
- Multi-core approach requires an S-subgame PNE under the frozen core; our sufficient conditions (undirected/structurally balanced S) are not necessary; refining these would enlarge applicability.

Next steps
- Broaden UPA families: explore exact/ordinal potential polymatrix blocks beyond symmetry; identify minimal forbidden signed substructures for UPA.
- Tighten cohesive criteria (only boundary nodes of each core need the inequality); quantify tolerance to small violations.
- Implement the pipeline; empirically test on random signed graphs; measure success/failure rates and BR-path lengths.
