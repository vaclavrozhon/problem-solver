This strictly generalizes the single-core cohesive result and is composable with the SCC pipeline.\n- Provide a monotone best-response (BR) path construction and a length bound for unsigned components, and show how it composes after SCC gauging.\n- Add a general \u201csigned row-sum\u201d PNE certificate (a gauge-invariant extension of the consensus certificate) that is easy to check per instance.\n- Record a small-SCC UPA classification for 3-node SCCs (as a corollary of directed structural balance) for completeness and testing.\n\nMulti-core cohesive existence (formal statement and proof)\nNotation. For B\u2286V define w_i^B:=\u2211_{j\u2208B}|W_{ij}|. For \u03c3\u2208{\u00b11}^V let [\u03c3] denote the diagonal gauge, W^{[\u03c3]}=[\u03c3]W[\u03c3], h^{[\u03c3]}=[\u03c3]h. Gauges preserve absolute row sums: |W^{[\u03c3]}|=|W| and hence w_i^B is gauge-invariant.\n\nTheorem (multi-core cohesive existence). Let V be partitioned as V=R^1\u2294\u22ef\u2294R^m\u2294S. For each block R^t, suppose there exists \u03c4^(t)\u2208{\u00b11}^{R^t} such that (i) [\u03c4^(t)]W_{R^t R^t}[\u03c4^(t)] has nonnegative entries (i.e., G[R^t] is unsigned after \u03c4^(t)); and (ii) cohesiveness inequalities hold:\nfor all i\u2208R^t: w_i^{R^t} + \u03c4_i^{(t)} h_i \u2265 w_i^{V\\R^t}.\nLet \u03c4_R be the concatenation of \u03c4^(t) on R:=R^1\u2294\u22ef\u2294R^m. Consider the S-restricted game with R frozen to \u03c4_R; assume it admits a PNE z*\u2208{\u00b11}^S. Then the full game admits a PNE x* with x*_{R^t}=\u03c4^(t) for all t, and x*_S=z*.\nProof. Define \u03c3\u2208{\u00b11}^V by \u03c3_{R^t}=\u03c4^(t) for each t and \u03c3_S\u2261+1, and consider the [\u03c3]-transformed game on (W^{[\u03c3]},h^{[\u03c3]}). By construction, for any t, W^{[\u03c3]}_{R^t R^t} is nonnegative. Fix any i\u2208R^t. The one-step payoff gain at i for choosing +1 instead of \u22121 in the transformed game is\n\u0394_i(x)=2(h_i^{[\u03c3]}+\u2211_{j\u2208V} W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij} x_j).\nWe want +1 to be a best reply at i when x_{R^t}\u2261+1 and x_{V\\R^t} arbitrary. Using W^{[\u03c3]}_{R^t R^t}\u22650 we have\n\u2211_{j\u2208R^t} W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij} x_j \u2265 \u2211_{j\u2208R^t} W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij}\u00b7(+1) = \u2211_{j\u2208R^t} W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij} \u2265 0.\nFor the external part, for any x_{V\\R^t},\n\u2211_{j\u2208V\\R^t} W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij} x_j \u2265 \u2212 \u2211_{j\u2208V\\R^t} |W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij}| = \u2212 w_i^{V\\R^t}.\nHence for all x_{V\\R^t},\n\u0394_i(x) \u2265 2(h_i^{[\u03c3]} + \u2211_{j\u2208R^t} W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij} \u2212 w_i^{V\\R^t}).\nSince \u2211_{j\u2208R^t} W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij} \u2265 0 and h_i^{[\u03c3]}=\u03c3_i h_i = \u03c4_i^{(t)} h_i, the assumed inequality w_i^{R^t} + \u03c4_i^{(t)} h_i \u2265 w_i^{V\\R^t} implies\nh_i^{[\u03c3]} + \u2211_{j\u2208R^t} W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij} \u2212 w_i^{V\\R^t} \u2265 h_i^{[\u03c3]} + 0 \u2212 w_i^{V\\R^t} \u2265 \u2212 w_i^{R^t} + w_i^{R^t} = 0,\nso \u0394_i(x)\u22650. Therefore +1 is a best reply at every i\u2208R^t whenever x_{R^t}\u2261+1, independently of x_{V\\R^t}. In particular, the profile ((+1) on R, z on S) is a best reply for all players in R for every z.\nNow consider the S-restricted game with R frozen at \u03c4_R; in the transformed game this is equivalently R frozen at +1_R with external field h_S^{[\u03c3]}+W_{S R}^{[\u03c3]}\u00b71_R. By hypothesis choose z* a PNE in S for that subgame. Then x* defined by x*_{R}=+1 and x*_S=z* is a PNE of the transformed game. Mapping back via x=[\u03c3]y preserves best responses (Lemma NashGauge), so x*_{R^t}=\u03c4^(t) and x*_S=z* is a PNE in the original game. Non-uniqueness: if the inequality is tight for some i, \u0394_i can be zero, so ties may occur; nonetheless existence is guaranteed. \u220e\n\nMonotone BR paths and length bounds in unsigned components\nLemma (monotone BR in unsigned games). Let U\u2286V and W_{U U} be nonnegative. Consider the U-restricted game with external field f:=h_U+W_{U, V\\U} x_{V\\U} fixed. Starting from y^{(0)}\u2261\u22121_U, iterate as follows: at each step pick any i with y^{(k)}_i=\u22121 and marginal m_i(y^{(k)}):=h_i+\u2211_{j\u2208U}W_{ij} y^{(k)}_j + \u2211_{j\u2209U}W_{ij} x_j > 0, and set y^{(k+1)}_i=+1 (leave others unchanged). Then (i) the sequence (y^{(k)}) is coordinatewise nondecreasing; (ii) each coordinate flips at most once; (iii) the process halts in at most |U| steps at a PNE of the U-restricted game.\nProof. If W_{U U}\u22650 then for any j, increasing y_i from \u22121 to +1 weakly increases m_j due to nonnegativity of W_{j i}, so once m_i>0 it remains >0 thereafter; thus no coordinate flips back. Hence at most |U| flips occur. At termination, no i with y_i=\u22121 has m_i>0; and if some y_i=+1 had m_i<0 it would be profitable to flip to \u22121; but under the policy we never induce such contradictions because each flip happens only when m_i>0. A standard supermodular-game argument shows the terminal profile is a PNE. \u220e\nCorollary (length bound under SCC composition after gauging). Suppose each SCC U_k can be gauged to unsigned (e.g., structurally balanced, functional-positive, or undirected). Process SCCs in reverse topological order; within each U_k, apply the monotone procedure starting from \u22121_{U_k}. Then there exists a BR path to a global PNE of total length \u2264\u2211_k |U_k|.\n\nSigned row-sum PNE certificate\nLemma (signed row-sum certificate). If there exists \u03c3\u2208{\u00b11}^V such that\n\u2200i: h_i \u03c3_i + \u2211_{j} W_{ij} \u03c3_i \u03c3_j \u2265 0,\nthen x=\u03c3 is a PNE. If the inequalities are strict, x is a strict PNE.\nProof. The gain from flipping i at x=\u03c3 equals 2(h_i \u03c3_i + \u2211_j W_{ij} \u03c3_i \u03c3_j). Nonnegativity implies no profitable deviation. \u220e\nRemark. This generalizes the consensus row-sum test (take \u03c3\u2261\u00b11) and is useful for fast per-instance checks after trying a few signatures (e.g., signatures suggested by structural-balance labeling).\n\nThree-node SCCs: UPA classification\nProposition. Let U be a strongly connected set with |U|=3. Then U is UPA (admits a PNE for all external fields restricted to U) if and only if U is directed-structurally balanced (equivalently, every directed cycle in U has positive sign product).\nProof. (\u21d2) Necessity: if some directed cycle has negative sign product, with h_U=0 each node is strictly responsive and the BR constraints around the cycle contradict, so no PNE. (\u21d0) Sufficiency: structural balance yields a signature \u03c3 with [\u03c3]W_{U U}[\u03c3]\u22650; the signed game on U is unsigned and supermodular for any external field, hence admits a PNE; mapping back preserves PNE. \u220e\n\nExample (multi-core cohesive)\nLet V={1,2,3,4,5}. Let R^1={1,2}, R^2={3,4}, S={5}. Weights:\n- On R^1: W_{12}=W_{21}=2; on R^2: W_{34}=W_{43}=1 (unsigned already). Cross-blocks: W_{15}=W_{25}=\u22120.5, W_{35}=W_{45}=\u22120.5; all other cross-weights 0. h\u22610. Then for i\u2208R^1: w_i^{R^1}=2, w_i^{V\\R^1}=0.5; for i\u2208R^2: w_i^{R^2}=1, w_i^{V\\R^2}=0.5. Choose \u03c4^(1)=+1_{R^1}, \u03c4^(2)=+1_{R^2}; cohesiveness holds: 2\u22650.5 and 1\u22650.5. The S-subgame with R frozen at \u03c4_R has u_5(z)=z(\u2211_{j\u2208R}W_{5j}\u03c4_j)=z\u00b70 (no in-weights), so any z is a best reply; pick z*=+1. By the theorem, x*=(+,+,+,+ ; +) is a PNE.\n\nObstacles\n- UPA SCCs beyond undirected/structurally balanced/functional-positive remain to be characterized. Structural balance is necessary for universal-in-h guarantees in strongly connected components (negative directed cycles obstruct at h=0), but there may be further weight-structural classes admitting UPA; identifying them requires new potential/monotonicity structures.\n- Exact counting of PNE in functional cycles under ties (|h_i|=|w_i|) depends on tie-breaking; our counting is exact only when all nodes are strictly responsive.\n\nNext steps\n- Formalize an end-to-end polynomial-time checker: (i) Tarjan SCCs; (ii) per-SCC tests: symmetric (exact potential), directed structural balance (parity labeling), functional-positive (outdegree \u22641 and positive cycle signs); (iii) if all SCCs UPA, construct a PNE by reverse topological order using the monotone procedure (length \u2264\u2211|U_k|); (iv) if not, attempt cohesive-core construction (single-core or multi-core) after suitable signatures; (v) report dominant negative cycle obstructions when found.\n- Explore additional UPA SCC families (e.g., ordinal-potential polymatrix blocks) and negative certificates (cycle dominance with margins) with algorithmic detection.\n"
