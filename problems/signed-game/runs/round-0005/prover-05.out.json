This yields a new PNE-guaranteeing class assembled from several cohesive unsigned/balanced cores plus a residual S-subgame admitting a PNE.\n- Derive a BR-path existence and a length bound under these cohesive conditions, by exploiting dominance of the core margins and monotone BR paths in unsigned parts.\n- Provide a small working example and discuss when strictness yields BR-invariance of the core part.\n\nTheorem (Multi-core cohesive existence)\nLet V be partitioned as V = (\u2294_{t=1}^m R^t) \u2294 S. For each t\u2208{1,\u2026,m}, assume there exists \u03c4^{(t)}\u2208{\u00b11}^{R^t} such that\n\u03c4_i^{(t)} W_{ij} \u03c4_j^{(t)} \u2265 0,  for all i,j\u2208R^t.\nLet \u03c3\u2208{\u00b11}^V be defined by \u03c3_{R^t}=\u03c4^{(t)} for all t and \u03c3_S=1. Denote the gauge-transformed data by W^{[\u03c3]}=[\u03c3]W[\u03c3] and h^{[\u03c3]}=[\u03c3]h. For a subset B\u2286V, define w_i^{B} := \u2211_{j\u2208B} |W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij}|.\nAssume\n(A) w_i^{R^t} + h_i^{[\u03c3]} \u2265 w_i^{V\\R^t}, for all i\u2208R^t and all t.\n(B) The S-restricted game with the core frozen at y_R := 1 (i.e., with external field f_S := h_S^{[\u03c3]} + W^{[\u03c3]}_{S,R} 1) admits a PNE z^*\u2208{\u00b11}^S.\nThen x^* := [\u03c3](1_R, z^*) is a pure Nash equilibrium of the original SNC game.\nProof. Work in the transformed coordinates. Consider the profile x^{[\u03c3]}=(1_R,z^*). For i\u2208R^t,\n\u0394_i := u_i^{[\u03c3]}(+1, x^{[\u03c3]}_{-i}) \u2212 u_i^{[\u03c3]}(\u22121, x^{[\u03c3]}_{-i}) = 2( h_i^{[\u03c3]} + \u2211_{j\u2208V} W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij} x^{[\u03c3]}_j ).\nSplit V into R^t and its complement:\n\u2211_{j\u2208V} W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij} x^{[\u03c3]}_j = \u2211_{j\u2208R^t} W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij}\u00b71 + \u2211_{j\u2209R^t} W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij} x^{[\u03c3]}_j.\nUsing |\u2211_{j\u2209R^t} W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij} x^{[\u03c3]}_j| \u2264 \u2211_{j\u2209R^t} |W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij}| = w_i^{V\\R^t} and \u2211_{j\u2208R^t} W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij} \u2265 \u2212 \u2211_{j\u2208R^t} |W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij}| = \u2212 w_i^{R^t} (since W^{[\u03c3]}_{R^tR^t} \u2265 0),\nwe get\n\u0394_i \u2265 2( h_i^{[\u03c3]} \u2212 w_i^{V\\R^t} + \u2211_{j\u2208R^t} W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij} ) \u2265 2( h_i^{[\u03c3]} \u2212 w_i^{V\\R^t} \u2212 w_i^{R^t} ).\nEquivalently,\n\u0394_i \u2265 2( h_i^{[\u03c3]} + w_i^{R^t} \u2212 w_i^{V\\R^t} ) \u2265 0,\nby (A). Hence +1 is a best response for every i\u2208R^t (ties allowed when \u0394_i=0). By (B), z^* is a PNE of the S-restricted game with y_R\u22611, so every j\u2208S is best-responding to x^{[\u03c3]} as well. Therefore x^{[\u03c3]} is a PNE of the transformed game, and x^*=[\u03c3]x^{[\u03c3]} is a PNE of the original game (gauge equivalence of best responses). \u220e\nRemarks.\n- If the inequalities in (A) are strict for all i\u2208R^t, then every core player in R plays a strict best response in x^*, which is useful for BR-invariance of the core part.\n- Condition (B) holds if, for instance, G_S is undirected (exact potential) or structurally balanced (after a local gauge, unsigned; supermodular): in both cases the S-subgame admits a PNE for any external field.\n\nCorollary (BR-path existence and length bound)\nUnder the assumptions of the theorem, suppose further that the PNE set of the S-restricted game with y_R\u22611 is globally BR-reachable (e.g., S undirected or structurally balanced). Then there exists a BR-path in the full game from any initial profile to some PNE of the form x^*=[\u03c3](1_R,z^*). Moreover:\n- For each i\u2208R, +1 is a best response in the transformed coordinates for any values of the other coordinates, by (A). Hence, from any initial profile, one can flip each core vertex in R to +1 in at most |R| best-response steps (ties allowed), yielding (1_R, z_0) for some z_0\u2208{\u00b11}^S.\n- Then follow a BR-path of the S-restricted game from z_0 to z^* (length L_S), keeping y_R\u22611. Concatenation yields a BR-path of length \u2264 |R| + L_S.\nIf the S-subgame is unsigned (after a gauge), a monotone BR path exists of length L_S \u2264 |S|, thus a total bound \u2264 |V|.\n\nExample\nLet V={1,2,3,4,5}, R^1={1,2}, R^2={3,4}, S={5}, h=0. Take internal weights W_{12}=W_{21}=2 and W_{34}=W_{43}=2 (already unsigned on R^1,R^2, so \u03c4^{(1)}=\u03c4^{(2)}=1). Let cross weights (arbitrary signs) satisfy for each i\u2208R, \u2211_{j\u2209R^t}|W_{ij}| \u2264 1. Then w_i^{R^t}=2 and w_i^{V\\R^t} \u2264 1, so (A) holds. The S-subgame has only one node (5), hence (B) holds trivially. Therefore there is a PNE with x_{R^1}=x_{R^2}=+1; x_5 is chosen as a best response to R (either \u00b11 if indifferent). A BR-path of length \u22645 exists: flip nodes in R to +1 (at most 4 steps), then set x_5.\n\nDiscussion and strictness\n- If w_i^{R^t} + h_i^{[\u03c3]} > w_i^{V\\R^t} for all i\u2208R, then in the profile x^* the core actions are strict best responses, so any BR move must come from S. If, in addition, the S-subgame admits a BR-stable PNE set (e.g., S undirected), then the set of resulting global equilibria with x_R fixed is BR-invariant.\n\nObstacles\n- The multi-core theorem is sufficient, not necessary. It may fail when (A) does not hold, yet a PNE exists (e.g., due to favorable biases). Identifying necessary conditions remains open.\n\nNext steps\n- Integrate this blockwise cohesive module into the SCC-based pipeline: (i) decompose; (ii) for SCCs failing UPA, search cohesive cores satisfying (A); (iii) check the residual subgame (undirected/structurally balanced) for (B).\n- Provide an algorithm computing a BR path of length \u2264 |R|+|S| by the constructive flips above (after a global gauge), and quantify strictness margins required for BR-invariance of the core actions.\n"
