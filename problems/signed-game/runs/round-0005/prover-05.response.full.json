I wonder if I could introduce a guaranteed class called \"Quasi-bipartite graphs.\" In this case, I'd have two sets that are nonnegative within but not necessarily negative across. The property I'll explore seems to ensure the SCC composition of two subgames, which can interact with arbitrary directed edges. Is that turning into a cohesive core type?",

Denote the gauge-transformed data by W^{[\u03c3]}=[\u03c3]W[\u03c3] and h^{[\u03c3]}=[\u03c3]h. For a subset B\u2286V, define w_i^{B} := \u2211_{j\u2208B} |W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij}|.\\nAssume\\n(A) w_i^{R^t} + h_i^{[\u03c3]} \u2265 w_i^{V\\\\R^t}, for all i\u2208R^t and all t.\\n(B) The S-restricted game with the core frozen at y_R := 1 (i.e., with external field f_S := h_S^{[\u03c3]} + W^{[\u03c3]}_{S,R} 1) admits a PNE z^*\u2208{\u00b11}^S.\\nThen x^* := [\u03c3](1_R, z^*) is a pure Nash equilibrium of the original SNC game.\\nProof. Work in the transformed coordinates. Consider the profile x^{[\u03c3]}=(1_R,z^*). For i\u2208R^t,\\n\u0394_i := u_i^{[\u03c3]}(+1, x^{[\u03c3]}_{-i}) \u2212 u_i^{[\u03c3]}(\u22121, x^{[\u03c3]}_{-i}) = 2( h_i^{[\u03c3]} + \u2211_{j\u2208V} W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij} x^{[\u03c3]}_j ).\\nSplit V into R^t and its complement:\\n\u2211_{j\u2208V} W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij} x^{[\u03c3]}_j = \u2211_{j\u2208R^t} W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij}\u00b71 + \u2211_{j\u2209R^t} W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij} x^{[\u03c3]}_j.\\nUsing |\u2211_{j\u2209R^t} W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij} x^{[\u03c3]}_j| \u2264 \u2211_{j\u2209R^t} |W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij}| = w_i^{V\\\\R^t} and \u2211_{j\u2208R^t} W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij} \u2265 \u2212 \u2211_{j\u2208R^t} |W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij}| = \u2212 w_i^{R^t} (since W^{[\u03c3]}_{R^tR^t} \u2265 0),\\nwe get\\n\u0394_i \u2265 2( h_i^{[\u03c3]} \u2212 w_i^{V\\\\R^t} + \u2211_{j\u2208R^t} W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij} ) \u2265 2( h_i^{[\u03c3]} \u2212 w_i^{V\\\\R^t} \u2212 w_i^{R^t} ).\\nEquivalently,\\n\u0394_i \u2265 2( h_i^{[\u03c3]} + w_i^{R^t} \u2212 w_i^{V\\\\R^t} ) \u2265 0,\\nby (A). Hence +1 is a best response for every i\u2208R^t (ties allowed when \u0394_i=0). By (B), z^* is a PNE of the S-restricted game with y_R\u22611, so every j\u2208S is best-responding to x^{[\u03c3]} as well. Therefore x^{[\u03c3]} is a PNE of the transformed game, and x^*=[\u03c3]x^{[\u03c3]} is a PNE of the original game (gauge equivalence of best responses). \u220e\\nRemarks.\\n- If the inequalities in (A) are strict for all i\u2208R^t, then every core player in R plays a strict best response in x^*, which is useful for BR-invariance of the core part.\\n- Condition (B) holds if, for instance, G_S is undirected (exact potential) or structurally balanced (after a local gauge, unsigned; supermodular): in both cases the S-subgame admits a PNE for any external field.\\n\\nCorollary (BR-path existence and length bound)\\nUnder the assumptions of the theorem, suppose further that the PNE set of the S-restricted game with y_R\u22611 is globally BR-reachable (e.g., S undirected or structurally balanced). Then there exists a BR-path in the full game from any initial profile to some PNE of the form x^*=[\u03c3](1_R,z^*). Moreover:\\n- For each i\u2208R, +1 is a best response in the transformed coordinates for any values of the other coordinates, by (A). Hence, from any initial profile, one can flip each core vertex in R to +1 in at most |R| best-response steps (ties allowed), yielding (1_R, z_0) for some z_0\u2208{\u00b11}^S.\\n- Then follow a BR-path of the S-restricted game from z_0 to z^* (length L_S), keeping y_R\u22611. Concatenation yields a BR-path of length \u2264 |R| + L_S.\\nIf the S-subgame is unsigned (after a gauge), a monotone BR path exists of length L_S \u2264 |S|, thus a total bound \u2264 |V|.\\n\\nExample\\nLet V={1,2,3,4,5}, R^1={1,2}, R^2={3,4}, S={5}, h=0. Take internal weights W_{12}=W_{21}=2 and W_{34}=W_{43}=2 (already unsigned on R^1,R^2, so \u03c4^{(1)}=\u03c4^{(2)}=1). Let cross weights (arbitrary signs) satisfy for each i\u2208R, \u2211_{j\u2209R^t}|W_{ij}| \u2264 1. Then w_i^{R^t}=2 and w_i^{V\\\\R^t} \u2264 1, so (A) holds. The S-subgame has only one node (5), hence (B) holds trivially. Therefore there is a PNE with x_{R^1}=x_{R^2}=+1; x_5 is chosen as a best response to R (either \u00b11 if indifferent). A BR-path of length \u22645 exists: flip nodes in R to +1 (at most 4 steps), then set x_5.\\n\\nDiscussion and strictness\\n- If w_i^{R^t} + h_i^{[\u03c3]} > w_i^{V\\\\R^t} for all i\u2208R, then in the profile x^* the core actions are strict best responses, so any BR move must come from S. If, in addition, the S-subgame admits a BR-stable PNE set (e.g., S undirected), then the set of resulting global equilibria with x_R fixed is BR-invariant.\\n\\nObstacles\\n- The multi-core theorem is sufficient, not necessary. It may fail when (A) does not hold, yet a PNE exists (e.g., due to favorable biases). Identifying necessary conditions remains open.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Integrate this blockwise cohesive module into the SCC-based pipeline: (i) decompose; (ii) for SCCs failing UPA, search cohesive cores satisfying (A); (iii) check the residual subgame (undirected/structurally balanced) for (B).\\n- Provide an algorithm computing a BR path of length \u2264 |R|+|S| by the constructive flips above (after a global gauge), and quantify strictness margins required for BR-invariance of the core actions.\\n\"}",
