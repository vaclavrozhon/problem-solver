Round summary: Established graph-level and modular guarantees for PNE in binary SNC games. Main graph-level result: a dependency digraph guarantees a PNE for every W (supported on the digraph) and every h iff the digraph is acyclic (DAG) — backward induction gives existence and a BR-path; any directed cycle can be signed to obstruct uniform existence. Modular construction: SCC composition — if every SCC is universally PNE-admitting (UPA) under arbitrary external fields (examples: undirected SCCs, structurally balanced SCCs after a gauge, functional-cycle SCCs with positive cycle-sign), then assembling PNEs from sinks upward gives a global PNE and BR-path. Added diagnostics and constructive modules: two-node digon test, functional-digraph cycle-sign test, multi-core cohesive existence, monotone bounded-length BR paths, forest corollary, signed row-sum PNE certificate, and dominant-negative-cycle nonexistence certificate.
