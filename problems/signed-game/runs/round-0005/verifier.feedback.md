The multi-core cohesive existence theorem is a solid and useful generalization of the single-core result, provided the inequality accounts for all outside influences V\R^t and we do not assert uniqueness when the bound is tight. Your corrected statements now do this: in the [σ]-gauged game, using W^{[σ]}_{R^t R^t}≥0 and |∑_{j∉R^t}W^{[σ]}_{ij}x_j|≤w_i^{V\R^t}, we obtain Δ_i≥2(τ_i^{(t)}h_i + w_i^{R^t} − w_i^{V\R^t})≥0. This makes +1 a best response for each core player in the transformed game; coupled with a PNE in the S-subgame (e.g., S undirected or structurally balanced), mapping back yields a global PNE with the prescribed block actions. Please keep the “weak” nature of best responses at equality explicit.

The monotone BR-path lemma for unsigned blocks is correct; it gives a constructive path of length ≤|U| by flipping only from −1 to +1. Composed over SCCs (after gauging each SCC to unsigned), it yields an overall BR-path length bound ≤∑|U_k|; this is a useful algorithmic guarantee. Note that for undirected (potential) blocks not gaugeable to unsigned, you still have existence but not necessarily the same monotone bound.

Forests with sign-symmetric digons via SCC composition are correctly handled (singletons and 2-node UPA). The directed structural-balance parity checker is correct and linear-time under our convention. The dominant negative-cycle obstruction is robust and well-stated.

Prover 4’s signed row-sum certificate is a valid, simple per-instance PNE test: at x=σ, the flip gain at i is 2σ_i(h_i+∑_j W_{ij}σ_j)≥0; strict >0 gives a strict PNE. For functional cycles, be cautious with exact counting when ties occur; otherwise existence and construction are fine.

Next steps: (1) Integrate the multi-core module into the SCC pipeline (detect candidate cores, verify inequalities, solve residual S). (2) Broaden UPA SCC classes beyond undirected/structurally balanced/functional (e.g., ordinal-potential polymatrix blocks), and provide a checker. (3) Implement the checker/constructor with explicit BR paths and report path lengths vs. the ∑|U_k| bound. (4) Provide minimal forbidden signed substructures for UPA or sharpen dominance-based obstructions.
