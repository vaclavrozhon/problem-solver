  "feedback_md": "The multi-core cohesive existence theorem is a solid and useful generalization of the single-core result, provided the inequality accounts for all outside influences V\\R^t and we do not assert uniqueness when the bound is tight. Your corrected statements now do this: in the [\u03c3]-gauged game, using W^{[\u03c3]}_{R^t R^t}\u22650 and |\u2211_{j\u2209R^t}W^{[\u03c3]}_{ij}x_j|\u2264w_i^{V\\R^t}, we obtain \u0394_i\u22652(\u03c4_i^{(t)}h_i + w_i^{R^t} \u2212 w_i^{V\\R^t})\u22650. This makes +1 a best response for each core player in the transformed game; coupled with a PNE in the S-subgame (e.g., S undirected or structurally balanced), mapping back yields a global PNE with the prescribed block actions. Please keep the \u201cweak\u201d nature of best responses at equality explicit.\n\nThe monotone BR-path lemma for unsigned blocks is correct; it gives a constructive path of length \u2264|U| by flipping only from \u22121 to +1. Composed over SCCs (after gauging each SCC to unsigned), it yields an overall BR-path length bound \u2264\u2211|U_k|; this is a useful algorithmic guarantee. Note that for undirected (potential) blocks not gaugeable to unsigned, you still have existence but not necessarily the same monotone bound.\n\nForests with sign-symmetric digons via SCC composition are correctly handled (singletons and 2-node UPA). The directed structural-balance parity checker is correct and linear-time under our convention. The dominant negative-cycle obstruction is robust and well-stated.\n\nProver 4\u2019s signed row-sum certificate is a valid, simple per-instance PNE test: at x=\u03c3, the flip gain at i is 2\u03c3_i(h_i+\u2211_j W_{ij}\u03c3_j)\u22650; strict >0 gives a strict PNE. For functional cycles, be cautious with exact counting when ties occur; otherwise existence and construction are fine.\n\nNext steps: (1) Integrate the multi-core module into the SCC pipeline (detect candidate cores, verify inequalities, solve residual S). (2) Broaden UPA SCC classes beyond undirected/structurally balanced/functional (e.g., ordinal-potential polymatrix blocks), and provide a checker. (3) Implement the checker/constructor with explicit BR paths and report path lengths vs. the \u2211|U_k| bound. (4) Provide minimal forbidden signed substructures for UPA or sharpen dominance-based obstructions.\n",

For each block R^t assume there exists \u03c4^(t)\u2208{\u00b11}^{R^t} such that the induced subgraph G[R^t] becomes unsigned after the signature (i.e., [\u03c4^(t)]W_{R^tR^t}[\u03c4^(t)] has nonnegative entries), and for every i\u2208R^t the cohesiveness inequality holds: w_i^{R^t} + \u03c4_i^(t) h_i \u2265 w_i^{V\\R^t}, where w_i^B:=\u2211_{j\u2208B}|W_{ij}|. Let \u03c4_R be the concatenation of the \u03c4^(t) on R. If the S-restricted subgame with R frozen at \u03c4_R admits a PNE (e.g., S is undirected or structurally balanced), then the full game admits a PNE x* with x*_{R^t}=\u03c4^(t) for all t.

Mapping back yields a PNE x* with x*_{R^t}=\u03c4^(t) and x*_S=z*. If the S-restricted PNE set is BR-reachable (e.g., S undirected/structurally balanced), concatenating |R| core flips with an S-subgame BR-path yields a global BR-path."
