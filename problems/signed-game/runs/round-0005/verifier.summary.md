Validated and formalized a corrected multi-core cohesive existence theorem; added a monotone BR-path lemma for unsigned components with a compositional length bound; included a forest-with-sign-symmetric-digons corollary; kept structural-balance parity checking and dominant-cycle obstructions. Added a signed row-sum PNE certificate. Output updated to include the forest corollary; proofs updated with the row-sum certificate. Next: expand UPA SCC classes and implement the full checker/constructor pipeline.
