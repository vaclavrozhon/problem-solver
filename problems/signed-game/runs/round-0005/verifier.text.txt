{"feedback_md":"The multi-core cohesive existence theorem is a solid and useful generalization of the single-core result, provided the inequality accounts for all outside influences V\\R^t and we do not assert uniqueness when the bound is tight. Your corrected statements now do this: in the [σ]-gauged game, using W^{[σ]}_{R^t R^t}≥0 and |∑_{j∉R^t}W^{[σ]}_{ij}x_j|≤w_i^{V\\R^t}, we obtain Δ_i≥2(τ_i^{(t)}h_i + w_i^{R^t} − w_i^{V\\R^t})≥0. This makes +1 a best response for each core player in the transformed game; coupled with a PNE in the S-subgame (e.g., S undirected or structurally balanced), mapping back yields a global PNE with the prescribed block actions. Please keep the “weak” nature of best responses at equality explicit.\n\nThe monotone BR-path lemma for unsigned blocks is correct; it gives a constructive path of length ≤|U| by flipping only from −1 to +1. Composed over SCCs (after gauging each SCC to unsigned), it yields an overall BR-path length bound ≤∑|U_k|; this is a useful algorithmic guarantee. Note that for undirected (potential) blocks not gaugeable to unsigned, you still have existence but not necessarily the same monotone bound.\n\nForests with sign-symmetric digons via SCC composition are correctly handled (singletons and 2-node UPA). The directed structural-balance parity checker is correct and linear-time under our convention. The dominant negative-cycle obstruction is robust and well-stated.\n\nProver 4’s signed row-sum certificate is a valid, simple per-instance PNE test: at x=σ, the flip gain at i is 2σ_i(h_i+∑_j W_{ij}σ_j)≥0; strict >0 gives a strict PNE. For functional cycles, be cautious with exact counting when ties occur; otherwise existence and construction are fine.\n\nNext steps: (1) Integrate the multi-core module into the SCC pipeline (detect candidate cores, verify inequalities, solve residual S). (2) Broaden UPA SCC classes beyond undirected/structurally balanced/functional (e.g., ordinal-potential polymatrix blocks), and provide a checker. (3) Implement the checker/constructor with explicit BR paths and report path lengths vs. the ∑|U_k| bound. (4) Provide minimal forbidden signed substructures for UPA or sharpen dominance-based obstructions.\n","summary_md":"Validated and formalized a corrected multi-core cohesive existence theorem; added a monotone BR-path lemma for unsigned components with a compositional length bound; included a forest-with-sign-symmetric-digons corollary; kept structural-balance parity checking and dominant-cycle obstructions.

Partition V=R^1⊔⋯⊔R^m⊔S. For each block R^t assume there exists τ^(t)∈{±1}^{R^t} such that the induced subgraph G[R^t] becomes unsigned after the signature (i.e., [τ^(t)]W_{R^tR^t}[τ^(t)] has nonnegative entries), and for every i∈R^t the cohesiveness inequality holds: w_i^{R^t} + τ_i^(t) h_i ≥ w_i^{V\\R^t}, where w_i^B:=∑_{j∈B}|W_{ij}|. Let τ_R be the concatenation of the τ^(t) on R. If the S-restricted subgame with R frozen at τ_R admits a PNE (e.g., S is undirected or structurally balanced), then the full game admits a PNE x* with x*_{R^t}=τ^(t) for all t. A BR-path to x* exists whenever the S-restricted PNE set is BR-reachable.\nProof. Define σ by σ_{R^t}=τ^(t) and σ_S=1 and consider the [σ]-transformed game. For i∈R^t and any x_{V\\R^t}, the best-response marginal at +1 versus −1 satisfies\nΔ_i ≥ 2(h_i^{[σ]} + ∑_{j∈R^t} W^{[σ]}_{ij} − w_i^{V\\R^t}) = 2(τ_i^(t) h_i + w_i^{R^t} − w_i^{V\\R^t}) ≥ 0,\nusing W^{[σ]}_{R^tR^t}≥0 and |∑_{j∉R^t} W^{[σ]}_{ij} x_j| ≤ w_i^{V\\R^t}. Thus +1 is a best response for every i∈R^t whenever x_{R^t}≡+1. By hypothesis, choose z* a PNE of the S-restricted transformed subgame with R fixed at +1; then (1_R,z*) is a PNE of the transformed game. Mapping back yields a PNE x* with x*_{R^t}=τ^(t) and x*_S=z*. If the S-restricted PNE set is BR-reachable (e.g., S undirected/structurally balanced), concatenating |R| core flips with an S-subgame BR-path yields a global BR-path."}}
