Definitions.
• A signed network is a graph G = (V, E) where each edge has a
weight wuv ∈ R (can be negative). Each vertex i ∈ V is a player
who chooses an action xi ∈ {−1, +1}.
• The utility of i ∈ V is given by a function that depends on the
weights and actions. Typical examples:
• pure anti-coordination (all weights = −1):
ui(xi) = |j ∈ N(i) : xj ̸= xi|
• signed payoff (binary actions xi ∈ {±1}):
ui(xi) = \sum_{j∈N(i)} (w_{ij} \cdot x_i \cdot x_j)

• A strategy X is a pure Nash equilibrium (or stable coloring) if
no vertex can change its action and strictly increase its utility.

Question: Identify graphs that guarantee the existence of a pure
Nash equilibrium in signed coordination games.
