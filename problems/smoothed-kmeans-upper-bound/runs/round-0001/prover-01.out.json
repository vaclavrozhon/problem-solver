A natural route is to exploit oversampling-style guarantees (Makarychev\u2013Reddy\u2013Shan 2020, arXiv:2010.14487) when k \u201covershoots\u201d the \u201ceffective\u201d number of active clusters on a given scale. We formalize this via a dyadic (factor-2) plateau decomposition of OPT(\u00b7).\n- Key input from 2010.14487: For k-means++ seeding with k+\u0394 centers, the expected bi-criteria approximation against OPT(k) is at most 5\u00b7min{2 + 1/(2e) + ln(2k/\u0394), 1 + k/(e(\u0394\u22121))}. This is especially strong when \u0394 is a nontrivial fraction of k (or when \u0394 is large enough so that ln(2k/\u0394) = O(log log k)).\n- Strategy: Partition [k0,2k0) into dyadic plateaus Ij = [k(j), k(j+1)) where k(0)=k0 and k(j+1) is the smallest k \u2265 k(j) with OPT(k) \u2264 OPT(k(j))/2. Then OPT(k) \u2208 (OPT(k(j))/2, OPT(k(j))] for all k\u2208Ij. If k varies uniformly over Ij, running k-means++ with parameter k acts like oversampling by \u0394 = k\u2212k(j) relative to base m:=k(j) while we are evaluated against OPT(k), which differs by at most a factor 2 from OPT(m). Averaging the bi-criteria bound across \u0394 on each plateau yields an O(1 + ln(2m/|Ij|)) contribution.\n\nFormal lemmas (clean, checkable)\n\n- Lemma 1 (Per-plateau averaged guarantee). Fix a dyadic plateau I=[m, m+L)\u2286[k0,2k0), so that for all k\u2208I, OPT(k)\u2208(\u0398/2,\u0398] with \u0398:=OPT(m). Then, for k uniform in I and over k-means++ randomness,\n  E_k[ ALG(k)/OPT(k) ] \u2264 10\u00b7(C0 + E_{\u0394\u223cU({0,\u2026,L\u22121})}[ f_m(\u0394) ])\n  where f_m(\u0394) = min{2 + 1/(2e) + ln(2m/max{1,\u0394}), 1 + m/(e(max{1,\u0394}\u22121))}, and C0 is an absolute constant accounting for \u0394=0. In particular, for L\u22652,\n  E_k[ ALG(k)/OPT(k) ] \u2264 10\u00b7(C1 + ln(2m/L)) + O((ln m)/L).\n  Why useful here: Converts the bi-criteria guarantee (for k+\u0394 versus OPT(k)) into a directly applicable, per-plateau bound on the smoothed-in-k objective.\n  Sketch of proof: For \u0394\u22651, apply Makarychev\u2013Reddy\u2013Shan Lemma 5.6 with base m and \u0394 and note OPT(k)\u2265\u0398/2. Average the term ln(2m/\u0394) over \u0394=1,\u2026,L\u22121:\n  (1/(L\u22121))\u2211_{\u0394=1}^{L\u22121} ln(2m/\u0394) = ln(2m) \u2212 (ln((L\u22121)!))/(L\u22121) = ln(2m/L) + 1 + o(1) by Stirling. The \u0394=0 case contributes \u2264O((ln m)/L). Multiplying by the factor 2 from OPT(k)\u2208(\u0398/2,\u0398] yields the 10 factor.\n\n- Corollary 2 (Mixture across plateaus). Let {Ij} be the dyadic plateaus covering [k0,2k0), with lengths Lj and starts mj. Then\n  E_{k\u223cU([k0,2k0))}[ ALG(k)/OPT(k) ] \u2264 10\u00b7(C1 + (1/k0)\u2211_j Lj\u00b7ln(2mj/Lj)) + o(1).\n  Why useful: Reduces the global bound to a single explicit functional of the plateau-lengths {Lj} and starts {mj}. It cleanly isolates the role of \u201clong vs short\u201d plateaus.\n  Proof idea: Average the Lemma 1 bound over each plateau, weighted by Lj/k0.\n\n- Corollary 3 (Long-plateau gain). If some plateau I=[m,m+L) satisfies L \u2265 m / polylog(k0), then\n  E_{k\u2208I}[ ALG(k)/OPT(k) ] \u2264 O(log log k0). Consequently, if a constant fraction of [k0,2k0) is covered by such long plateaus, the overall smoothed-in-k expectation is O(log log k0).\n  Why useful: Quantifies the oversampling benefit under a natural structural condition on OPT(\u00b7). This formally explains the \u201cwhy randomizing k might help\u201d intuition.\n\nToy example to sanity-check Lemma 1\n\n- Construct OPT plateaus as follows: Let m=k0. For k\u2208[k0, k0 + L), define a dataset X so that OPT(k) remains within a factor of 2 of OPT(k0). Take L = k0 / (log k0)^2. Then Lemma 1 gives average over k in that interval E[ALG/OPT] \u2264 10\u00b7(C1 + ln(2m/L)) \u2248 O(ln((2k0)/(k0/(log k0)^2))) = O(ln((log k0)^2)) = O(log log k0). The \u0394=0 contribution is suppressed by its 1/L probability.\n\nGlobal worst-case discussion (what we can and cannot get yet)\n\n- Using Corollary 2 with mj \u2264 2k0 and \u2211_j Lj = k0 gives the trivial upper bound E \u2264 O(1) + (10/k0)\u2211_j Lj ln(2k0/Lj) = O(ln(2k0)) \u2212 (10/k0)\u2211_j Lj ln Lj. Since x ln x is convex, the sum \u2211 Lj ln Lj is minimized (and the bound maximized) when many Lj are tiny; in the extreme Lj=1 for all j, the term becomes O(ln k0). Thus, without structural assumptions on OPT(\u00b7), the plateau calculus alone cannot beat the O(log k0) worst-case baseline. This indicates that any unconditional improvement (e.g., to O(log log k0)) must invoke additional structure beyond dyadic plateau averaging.\n\nStrengthened coverage statement (toward handling runs of short plateaus)\n\n- Working Lemma (coverage of heavy part under scale separation; to be proved). Let k = k1 + k2 with k1 clusters (\u201cheavy\u201d) contributing a (1\u2212\u03b7) fraction of OPT(k1), and suppose OPT(k1) \u2265 k^{10}\u00b7OPT(k). Run k-means++ for k\u2032 = k1 + (1+\u03b5)k2 steps. Then, with probability \u2265 1\u2212k^{-c}, the first k1 steps hit all heavy clusters without collision, and the final cost is O(log(1/\u03b5))\u00b7OPT(k). Why useful here: If many consecutive short plateaus reflect the unlocking of finer \u201clight\u201d clusters while a small set remains heavy, this would effectively re-create the oversampling regime even when individual plateaus are short.\n- Plan to prove: Adapt the Markov-chain/misses framework of Makarychev\u2013Reddy\u2013Shan (Sec. 5) to a setting where a constant-\u03b7 mass sits on the heavy clusters until they are covered. Show that the probability of a miss among heavy clusters before covering them all is \u2264 poly(\u03b7)/poly(k). Then apply their uncovered-cost decay bound (Lemma 5.5) after heavy coverage to control the tail.\n\nObstacles and open points\n\n- Unconditional bound: The plateau-based mixture (Corollary 2) alone does not preclude worst-cases yielding \u0398(log k0) average (e.g., many very short plateaus). We likely need a nontrivial structural inequality on the decrease rate of OPT(k) over k\u2208[k0,2k0) or a heavy-coverage argument as above.\n- \u0394=0 boundary: On each plateau, there is one k with \u0394=0 where only the standard O(log m) bound applies. This is negligible for long plateaus but may matter when many plateaus are short.\n- Lower bounds: It remains open whether one can construct a single fixed dataset X for which the smoothed-in-k expectation over [k0,2k0) is still \u03a9(log k0). Arthur\u2013Vassilvitskii\u2019s fixed-k lower bound adapts the instance to k and thus does not immediately imply a lower bound for the smoothed experiment.\n\nConcrete next steps\n\n1) Rigorous proof of Lemma 1 with explicit constants using Theorem 5.1 (bi-criteria bound) of Makarychev\u2013Reddy\u2013Shan (2020) and the dyadic plateau definition; include the precise handling of \u0394=0 and the OPT(k) versus OPT(m) factor.\n2) Derive Corollary 2 formally and simplify the functional \u2211 Lj ln(2mj/Lj); explore whether mild regularity constraints on OPT (e.g., quasiconvexity of k\u00b7OPT(k) or bounded discrete derivative decay) imply that a constant fraction of mass lies on long plateaus, yielding an O(log log k0) global bound.\n3) Begin the heavy-coverage lemma proof: (i) formalize a \u201cscale separation\u201d condition in terms of uncovered-cost mass; (ii) prove a coupon-collector-type bound for hitting all heavy clusters within the first k1 samples under D^2-weighting; (iii) plug into Makarychev\u2013Reddy\u2013Shan\u2019s uncovered-cost supermartingale to bound the tail.\n4) Try to craft candidate lower-bound datasets that could keep the smoothed-in-k expectation at \u03a9(log k0), or else gather evidence that such a construction is impossible, steering toward an unconditional improvement.\n\nNotes on output.md\n\n- No output.md was provided; thus, I cannot check curated results. The above lemmas are new suggestions relying on Theorem 5.1 of Makarychev\u2013Reddy\u2013Shan (2020) and can be made fully rigorous with short calculations as outlined."
