Both provers developed a dyadic “plateau” approach to bound E_{k∼U([k0,2k0))}[ALG(k)/OPT(k)] using the Makarychev–Reddy–Shan (2020) bi-criteria oversampling guarantee. They define 2-plateaus (OPT(k) within a factor 2) and show a per-plateau averaged bound: for a plateau starting at m of length L, the k-means++ average ratio is O(1 + ln(2m/L)) (constants from MRS). A per-k formulation via s(k):=min{s:OPT(s)≤2OPT(k)} and Δ(k)=k−s(k) gives E[ALG(k)] ≤ 10·min{2+1/(2e)+ln(2s/Δ), 1 + s/(e(Δ−1))}·OPT(k) for Δ≥1 (Δ=0 falls back to O(ln k)). Consequences: long plateaus (L ≥ m / polylog m) yield O(log log k0) averages; but many short plateaus can force only the trivial O(log k0) bound, so extra structure (or a “heavy-coverage” high‑probability lemma) is needed for an unconditional improvement.
