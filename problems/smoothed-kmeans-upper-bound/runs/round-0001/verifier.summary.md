High-level assessment and triage
Both reports pursue the same core idea: exploit the bi-criteria (oversampling) guarantee of Makarychev–Reddy–Shan (MRS, 2020) to bound the expected k-means++ ratio when k is drawn uniformly from [k0,2k0). The per-k reduction (choose a baseline s≤k with OPT(s) close to OPT(k) and treat the remaining k−s steps as oversampling) is sound and is the right lever. The dyadic plateau decomposition (intervals on which OPT(·) stays within a factor 2) is a natural way to control OPT(k) vs OPT(s). The arithmetic averaging of ln(2m/Δ) across Δ on a plateau, via Stirling bounds, is also correct in spirit and gives the characteristic ln(2m/L) term.
