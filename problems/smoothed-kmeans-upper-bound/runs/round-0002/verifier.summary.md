High-level assessment: Both reports make useful strides toward strengthening our per-plateau averaging by leveraging both branches of the MRS bi-criteria bound, and they correctly identify a monotonicity gap in output.md that we should close. However, there are important algebraic inaccuracies in the proposed split/averaging bounds that must be corrected before inclusion in output.md. Below I flag the issues and provide corrected statements (now curated into output.md), along with concrete next steps.
