{"feedback_md":"High-level assessment: Both reports make useful strides toward strengthening our per-plateau averaging by leveraging both branches of the MRS bi-criteria bound, and they correctly identify a monotonicity gap in output.md that we should close. However, there are important algebraic inaccuracies in the proposed split/averaging bounds that must be corrected before inclusion in output.md. Below I flag the issues and provide corrected statements (now curated into output.md), along with concrete next steps.\n\nWhat is correct and valuable:\n- Monotonicity of the MRS bound in (s,Δ) (both branches are nondecreasing in s and nonincreasing in Δ; the min preserves these monotonicities). This justifies the substitution (s(k),Δ(k)) → (m,k−m) on a factor-2 plateau. I added a clean Lemma to output.md with a short proof.\n- Using both branches for plateau averaging is a good idea. The clean inequality E[min(AΔ,BΔ)] ≤ min(E[AΔ], E[BΔ]) (with the Δ=1 adjustment) is correct and yields a “hybrid” average bound. I added a precise theorem that also subsumes a tunable split at an arbitrary threshold τ, which recovers both the pure-logarithmic bound (τ=L−1) and the “hybrid extreme” (τ=1) as special cases.\n- The long-plateau corollary (L ≥ α m ⇒ O(1) average) is valid with explicit constants. I added a version that keeps constants symbolic and tracks the small endpoint term O((ln m)/L).\n- The quantile-in-Δ idea is sound, but needs a careful threshold choice because the second branch requires Δ≥2. I added a precise corollary with T := max{2, ⌈η(L−1)⌉+1} giving a 1−η−O(1/L) fraction guarantee.\n\nIssues to fix in the provers’ derivations:\n- Proposition B (01) has two errors: (i) the constant a must be weighted by τ/(L−1), not added unweighted; (ii) for Δ≤τ, ln(2m/Δ) ≥ ln(2m/τ), so replacing ln(2m/Δ) by ln(2m/τ) gives a lower bound, not an upper bound. The correct upper bound for ∑_{Δ≤τ} ln(2m/Δ) comes from Stirling: ≤ τ(1+ln(2m/τ)). I included a corrected τ-split theorem (now Theorem 3) that gives a rigorous upper bound and recovers your intended regimes.\n- The “Hybrid plateau average” lemma (02) uses the valid inequality average(min) ≤ min(averages), but the displayed equality for B̄ omits a −1/(L−1) term. I fixed this in output.md and stated upper bounds using H_q ≤ ln q + 1 and Stirling.\n- Quantile statements must respect Δ≥2 for the second branch. I adjusted the threshold accordingly and accounted for the small O(1/L) loss in the fraction.\n\nSuggested next steps:\n1) Optimize the τ-split bound: Given Theorem 3, pick τ to minimize the RHS in closed form; e.g., solve for τ where the marginal decrease from the logarithmic part balances the harmonic tail from the large-Δ part. Provide a clean, uniform upper bound in terms of m and L (e.g., min{ln(2m/(L−1)), (m ln L)/L} up to additive constants), with a written proof.\n2) Global bound with hybrid averaging: Instantiate the decomposition across [k0,2k0) with Theorem 3 (τ chosen per plateau) and derive an explicit global improvement over Corollary 3, highlighting regimes where (m_j ln L_j)/L_j ≪ 1.\n3) Probability guarantees: Use the quantile-in-Δ corollary plus Markov to obtain joint (k,++) probabilities. State conditions under which a 1% measure of k enjoys constant-factor guarantees.\n4) Heavy-coverage program: Formalize the supermartingale argument (cite the exact MRS lemma you intend to use) to bound expected heavy-collisions. Aim first for an expected count bound O(k1/R), then bootstrap to high probability via Freedman’s inequality with a stopping-time argument.\n5) Lower-bound direction: Specify a concrete OPT_k schedule with tightly controlled ratios OPT_{k−1}/OPT_k and check it yields Δ(k)=1 on most k.\n","new_notes_md":"Refinements and corrections for plateau averaging and monotonicity\n\n- Monotonicity of the MRS bi-criteria bound. Define for integers s≥1 and Δ≥1 (interpreting the second branch only for Δ≥2):\n  f(s,Δ) := min{ a + ln(2s/Δ), 1 + s/(e(Δ−1)) }, where a := 2 + 1/(2e).\n  Then f is nondecreasing in s and nonincreasing in Δ. Consequently, on any factor-2 plateau I=[m,m+L) and for k=m+Δ with Δ≥1, the per-k bound from Theorem 1 satisfies\n  f(s(k),Δ(k)) ≤ f(m,Δ), so we may safely replace (s(k),Δ(k)) by (m,Δ) in upper bounds.\n\n- Correct τ-split averaging (fixing Proposition B). On a factor-2 plateau I=[m,m+L) with L≥2, for any integer τ∈{1,…,L−1}:\n  (1/(L−1)) ∑_{Δ=1}^{L−1} min{ a+ln(2m/Δ), 1 + m/(e(Δ−1)) } (with the second term read only for Δ≥2)\n  ≤ (τ/(L−1)) [ a + 1 + ln(2m/τ) ]\n    + ((L−1−τ)/(L−1))\n    + (m/(e(L−1))) · (H_{L−2} − H_{τ−1}).\n  Proof sketch: Split the sum at τ and use Stirling ln(τ!) ≥ τ ln τ − τ + 1 to bound ∑_{Δ≤τ} ln(2m/Δ) ≤ τ(1+ln(2m/τ)). For the tail, sum 1/(Δ−1) as H_{L−2}−H_{τ−1}. This corrects two issues in earlier drafts: (i) the constant a must be multiplied by τ/(L−1), and (ii) ln(2m/Δ) cannot be upper bounded by ln(2m/τ) when Δ≤τ.\n\n- Hybrid extremes recovered from the τ-split:\n  • Choosing τ=L−1 gives the pure-logarithmic average a+1+ln(2m/(L−1)).\n  • Choosing τ=1 gives the “hybrid extreme” 1 + (a+ln(2m))/(L−1) + (m/(e(L−1))) H_{L−2}.\n  Hence we may take the minimum of these two regimes for a tighter bound, plateau by plateau.\n\n- Long-plateau corollary. If L≥α m with α∈(0,1], then a+1+ln(2m/(L−1)) ≤ a+1+ln(2/α)+O(1/L), so the plateau-average is O(1) up to the endpoint term of order (ln m)/L.\n\n- Quantile-in-Δ bound (careful threshold). For any η∈(0,1), let T := max{2, ⌈η(L−1)⌉+1}. Then, for all Δ≥T, by the large-Δ branch\n  E_++[ALG_{m+Δ}/OPT_{m+Δ}] ≤ 2·C_bi·(1 + m/(e(T−1))).\n  The fraction of k∈I with Δ≥T is (L−T+1)/L = 1 − η − O(1/L). This yields a rigorous “with probability ≥ 1−η−O(1/L) over k uniform on the plateau” expected-ratio bound; Markov then converts it into a constant-factor joint (k,++) probability if desired.\n\n- Global decomposition improvement. Using the τ-split per plateau and optimizing τ as a function of (m,L) leads to a refined global bound that, informally, scales like\n  K0 + K1 · min{ ln^+(2m/(L−1)), (m ln L)/L } + K2 · (ln m)/L,\n  up to absolute constants K0,K1,K2. Formalizing this from Theorem 3 is a next step.\n\nOpen directions and next steps\n- Optimize τ in the τ-split bound and write a clean, closed-form per-plateau bound. Then aggregate over plateaus to strengthen Corollary 3.\n- Probability guarantees: phrase clean conditions under which at least a 1% measure of k (in [k0,2k0) or on a specific plateau) yields a constant expected ratio, and apply Markov to obtain joint (k,++) probability.\n- Heavy-coverage: formalize the supermartingale for heavy uncovered mass (precise citation from MRS), bound expected heavy-collisions by O(k1/R), and lift to high probability via Freedman/Azuma with a stopping time.\n- Lower bounds: construct OPT(·) with OPT_{k−1}/OPT_k ≈ 1 − Θ(1/ln k0) for most k to force Δ(k)=1 on a 1−o(1) fraction of the window, yielding an Ω(log k0) average.\n","new_notes_append":"True","new_outputs_md":"Lemma (Monotonicity of the MRS bi-criteria bound).\nLet a := 2 + 1/(2e), and for integers s≥1, Δ≥1 define\n  F(s,Δ) := min{ a + ln(2s/Δ), 1 + s/(e(Δ−1)) },\nwhere the second term is interpreted only for Δ≥2 (or taken as +∞ for Δ=1). Then:\n- For fixed Δ, F is nondecreasing in s.\n- For fixed s, F is nonincreasing in Δ (for all Δ≥1 in the above interpretation).\nProof.\nFor Δ≥2, both functions s ↦ a + ln(2s/Δ) and s ↦ 1 + s/(e(Δ−1)) are nondecreasing in s, hence their pointwise minimum is nondecreasing. For Δ≥2, both functions Δ ↦ a + ln(2s/Δ) and Δ ↦ 1 + s/(e(Δ−1)) are nonincreasing in Δ, hence the minimum is nonincreasing. For the transition from Δ=1 to Δ=2, note that F(s,1) = a + ln(2s) ≥ a + ln(s) ≥ a + ln(2s/2) ≥ F(s,2), since the logarithmic branch decreases with Δ and adding the second branch at Δ=2 can only decrease the minimum. Thus F is nonincreasing in Δ for all Δ≥1. ∎\n\nTheorem 3 (Plateau averaging with a tunable split of the two MRS branches).\nLet I = {m, m+1, …, m+L−1} be a factor-2 plateau (i.e., OPT_k ∈ (OPT_m/2, OPT_m] for k∈I) with L≥2. For any integer τ with 1≤τ≤L−1, for k uniform on I and over k-means++ randomness we have\n  E_{k∈I} E_++[ ALG_k / OPT_k ]\n  ≤ 2·C_bi · [ (τ/(L−1)) · ( a + 1 + ln(2m/τ) )\n                + ((L−1−τ)/(L−1))\n                + (m/(e(L−1))) · ( H_{L−2} − H_{τ−1} ) ]\n    + (C_fix · (ln m + O(1)))/L,\nwhere H_r denotes the r-th harmonic number (H_0:=0).\nProof.\nFix k=m+Δ with Δ∈{1,…,L−1}. By Theorem 1, and Lemma (monotonicity),\n  E_++[ALG_{m+Δ}/OPT_{m+Δ}] ≤ 2·C_bi · min{ a + ln(2m/Δ), 1 + m/(e(Δ−1)) },\nwith the second branch applicable for Δ≥2. Averaging Δ uniformly over {1,…,L−1}, split the sum at τ:\n  (1/(L−1)) ∑_{Δ=1}^{L−1} min{…}\n  ≤ (1/(L−1)) ∑_{Δ=1}^{τ} [ a + ln(2m/Δ) ]\n    + (1/(L−1)) ∑_{Δ=τ+1}^{L−1} [ 1 + m/(e(Δ−1)) ].\nFor the first sum, use ∑_{Δ=1}^{τ} ln(2m/Δ) = τ ln(2m) − ln(τ!) ≤ τ[1 + ln(2m/τ)] by ln(τ!) ≥ τ ln τ − τ. For the second, ∑_{Δ=τ+1}^{L−1} 1 = L−1−τ and ∑_{Δ=τ+1}^{L−1} 1/(Δ−1) = H_{L−2} − H_{τ−1}. This yields the displayed bound. Finally, incorporate the Δ=0 endpoint k=m which has probability 1/L and contributes at most C_fix·(ln m + O(1))/L by the fixed-k bound. ∎\n\nCorollary 4 (Hybrid extremes recovered; strengthening Theorem 2).\nIn the setting of Theorem 3:\n- Choosing τ = L−1 gives\n  E_{k∈I} E_++[ ALG_k / OPT_k ] ≤ 2·C_bi · ( a + 1 + ln(2m/(L−1)) ) + (C_fix · (ln m + O(1)))/L.\n  This recovers Theorem 2 (up to constant reparameterization by a and the explicit +1 from Stirling).\n- Choosing τ = 1 gives\n  E_{k∈I} E_++[ ALG_k / OPT_k ] ≤ 2·C_bi · ( 1 + (a+ln(2m))/(L−1) + (m/(e(L−1))) · H_{L−2} )\n    + (C_fix · (ln m + O(1)))/L.\nUsing H_q ≤ ln q + 1, this yields a complementary regime where the bound scales like 1 + O((ln m)/L) + O((m ln L)/L).\nProof.\nBoth bounds are immediate from Theorem 3 with the specified τ and the inequality H_q ≤ ln q + 1 for q≥1. ∎\n\nCorollary 5 (Explicit constants on long plateaus).\nIf L ≥ α m for some fixed α∈(0,1], then for k uniform on I,\n  E_{k∈I} E_++[ ALG_k / OPT_k ]\n  ≤ 2·C_bi · ( a + 1 + ln(2/α) ) + (C_fix · (ln m + O(1)))/L.\nProof.\nApply Corollary 4 with τ=L−1 and use ln(2m/(L−1)) ≤ ln(2/α) + O(1/L). The endpoint term is unchanged. ∎\n\nCorollary 6 (Quantile-in-Δ guarantee on a plateau).\nFix η∈(0,1) and let T := max{2, ⌈η(L−1)⌉+1}. Then for all Δ∈{T,…,L−1},\n  E_++[ ALG_{m+Δ} / OPT_{m+Δ} ] ≤ 2·C_bi · ( 1 + m/( e (T−1) ) ).\nConsequently, for k uniform on I, the fraction of k for which the above inequality holds is at least (L−T+1)/L = 1 − η − O(1/L).\nProof.\nFor Δ≥T, the large-Δ branch gives 1 + m/(e(Δ−1)) ≤ 1 + m/(e(T−1)).
