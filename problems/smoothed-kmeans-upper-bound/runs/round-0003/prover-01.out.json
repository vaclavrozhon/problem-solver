The large-\u0394 branch is applied only for \u0394\u22652 as required.\n- Minor note: In Theorem 2\u2019s proof, the factor (L\u22121)/L arises because averaging over the plateau includes the \u0394=0 endpoint with probability 1/L; this is implicitly used and consistent.\n\nI see no correctness issues that require changes to output.md. Below are incremental, testable improvements and additions built on the curated results.\n\n### Idea 1: A clean \u201coptimized-\u03c4\u201d corollary of Theorem 3\nGoal: Provide a simple, closed-form plateau bound by instantiating \u03c4 in Theorem 3 to either \u201cnear-full-log\u201d or \u201cmid-split,\u201d yielding a min-of-two functional that is easy to aggregate across plateaus.\n\nProposed Corollary (to add after Corollary 4). Let I=[m,m+L) with L\u22653. Then for k uniform in I and the algorithmic randomness,\n- Choose \u03c41 := L\u22121 (pure log branch). Then\n  E[ALG/OPT] \u2264 2 C_bi (a + 1 + ln(2m/(L\u22121))) + C_fix (ln m + O(1))/L.\n- Choose \u03c42 := \u230aL/2\u230b (balanced split). Using H_{L\u22122} \u2212 H_{\u03c42\u22121} \u2264 ln((L\u22121)/(\u03c42\u22121)) + 1 \u2264 ln 2 + 1, we get\n  E[ALG/OPT] \u2264 2 C_bi ( (1/2)(a + 1 + ln(4m/L)) + 1/2 + (m/(e(L\u22121)))(ln 2 + 1) ) + C_fix (ln m + O(1))/L.\nTaking the minimum of these two explicit bounds yields\n  E[ALG/OPT] \u2264 K0 + K1 \u00b7 min{ ln^+(2m/(L\u22121)), ln^+(4m/L) + (m/L) } + K2 \u00b7 (ln m)/L,\nfor absolute constants K0,K1,K2 depending only on C_bi,C_fix (e.g., with C_bi=C_fix=5, K0\u224835, K1\u224810, K2\u22485).\n\nWhy useful and how to verify:\n- This gives a simple min-of-two regime bound with an explicit (m/L) term rather than (m ln L)/L. It isolates the transition: if L is a constant fraction of m, both branches are O(1); if L\u226am, the logarithmic branch dominates, as expected.\n- Proof is a direct instantiation of Theorem 3 with \u03c4=L\u22121 and \u03c4=\u230aL/2\u230b, plus H_q \u2264 ln q + 1 and ln( (L\u22121)/(\u03c42\u22121) ) \u2264 ln 2 + o(1).\n\nOptional refinement (third choice \u03c43 := min{L\u22121, \u230am/e\u230b}). For this selection the harmonic tail is zero when L\u22121 \u2264 \u230am/e\u230b, giving a bound of order (m/L) with a constant inside the logarithm term ln(2e); this can be added as a third candidate branch to tighten constants further in some short-plateau regimes. I leave this out of the main corollary for simplicity but can provide it on request.\n\n### Idea 2: Global min-of-two mixture across plateaus\nUsing the corollary above inside the global decomposition (Corollary 3), we obtain\nE_k,++[ALG/OPT] \u2264 (1/k0) \u03a3_j L_j [ K0 + K1 \u00b7 min{ ln^+(2 m_j/(L_j\u22121)), ln^+(4 m_j/L_j) + (m_j/L_j) } ] + (K2/k0) \u03a3_j ln m_j.\n\nWhy useful: This sharpened aggregation makes explicit that extremely long plateaus (L_j\u2248m_j) contribute a constant (from ln terms \u2248 O(1) and m_j/L_j\u2248O(1)), while short plateaus revert to the log term ln(2 m_j/L_j). It recovers O(log log k0) under the same \u201clong plateau\u201d structural condition and clarifies that no unconditional improvement over O(log k0) is possible from plateau calculus alone.\n\nVerification plan: Numerically instantiate with synthetic OPT profiles to compare against Theorem 2; but analytically the bound follows by substituting the corollary on each I_j and summing with weights L_j/k0.\n\n### Idea 3: Explicit probability-\u22650.01 guarantees under a plateau mass condition\nWe can strengthen Corollary 6 to a concrete 1% probability guarantee over the joint (k,++) randomness under a simple condition.\n- Fix a plateau I=[m,m+L) with L\u2265\u03b1 m for some absolute \u03b1\u2208(0,1]. Pick \u03b7=0.01 in Corollary 6, so T=max{2, \u23080.01(L\u22121)\u2309+1} and for at least a (1\u2212\u03b7\u2212O(1/L)) fraction of k in I we have\n  E_++[ALG/OPT] \u2264 2 C_bi (1 + m/(e(T\u22121))) \u2264 2 C_bi (1 + 1/(e \u03b1 \u03b7)) \u2264 2 C_bi (1 + 100/(e \u03b1)).\n- With C_bi=5 and \u03b1=1, this gives E_++[ALG/OPT] \u2264 10(1+100/e) \u2248 10\u00b7(1+36.79) \u2248 378 on at least ~99% of k in I.\n- By Markov\u2019s inequality, for any c\u22651, P_{++}[ALG/OPT \u2264 c\u00b7378] \u2265 1\u22121/c on those k.\n- If such a plateau occupies a fraction p of [k0,2k0), the global joint (k,++) probability is \u2265 p\u00b7(0.99)(1\u22121/c). For example, p=0.02 and c=2 already give probability \u2265 0.0198 for a factor \u2264 756.\n\nThis addresses the task\u2019s \u201cprobability \u2265 0.01\u201d variant under a verifiable condition (a single long plateau). Constants can be tuned by selecting \u03b7 and c.\n\n### Idea 4: Micro-lemma toward heavy-coverage under scale separation\nWe propose a precise sub-claim to advance the conjectural \u201cheavy coverage\u201d lemma. Let the optimal k-partition be P=H\u222aL with |H|=k1 \u201cheavy\u201d clusters and |L|=k2. Suppose \u03a3_{Q\u2208H} OPT1(Q) \u2265 R \u00b7 \u03a3_{Q\u2208L} OPT1(Q) for R \u2265 k^C (C large). Consider the k-means++ run, and let U_t(H) be the uncovered heavy cost at step t, eH_t(H)=\u03a3_{Q\u2208H} eH_t(Q) (supermartingale from MRS Cor. 4.5).\n\nClaim (expected heavy-collision bound under a persistence condition). If there exists a constant \u03b2\u2208(0,1) such that for all t\u2264k1 (until the last few heavy clusters), E[U_t(H)] \u2265 \u03b2 \u03a3_{Q\u2208H} OPT1(Q), then the expected number of times k-means++ selects a point from a covered heavy cluster before all heavy clusters are hit is at most O(k1/(\u03b2 R)).\n\nSketch of argument (checkable steps):\n- At step t, the probability to sample from a covered heavy cluster is at most E[H_t(covered H)] / E[U_t(H) + H_t(covered H) + cost_t(L)]. By MRS Lemma 4.1 and the supermartingale property, E[H_t(covered H)] \u2264 5 \u03a3_{Q\u2208H} OPT1(Q) uniformly in t.\n- The denominator is \u2265 E[U_t(H)] + \u03a3_{Q\u2208L} OPT1(Q) (since covered costs on L are nonnegative). Under the \u03b2-persistence and the scale separation \u03a3_H \u2265 R \u03a3_L, this is \u2265 \u03b2 \u03a3_H + \u03a3_L \u2265 (\u03b2 + 1/R) \u03a3_H.\n- Thus the per-step collision probability is \u2264 5 \u03a3_H / ((\u03b2 + 1/R) \u03a3_H) \u2264 5/\u03b2 for small R, and \u2264 5 R / (\u03b2 R + 1) \u2264 5/(\u03b2) \u00b7 (1/R) when R is large. Being precise: for R\u22651/\u03b2 we have \u2264 10/(\u03b2 R). Summing over t up to k1 steps gives E[collisions among heavy] \u2264 O(k1/(\u03b2 R)).\n\nUsefulness and what remains: This turns scale separation into a quantitative bound on expected heavy-collisions, contingent on the (\u03b2-persistence) condition that uncovered heavy cost stays a constant fraction of \u03a3_H until near the end. The next step is to justify (\u03b2-persistence) under scale separation\u2014intuitively, centers selected outside H should not significantly reduce U_t(H) before we start hitting H, but this needs a geometric or potential-based argument. A path is to show that the expected reduction in U_t(H) from a center outside H is o(\u03a3_H) when R is large, using the same pairwise-bound technique as in MRS Lemma 4.1 aggregated over H.\n\nThis micro-lemma is an incremental step: it isolates the coupon-collector-like collision control given any \u03b2-persistence bound, paving the way for a high-probability heavy-coverage statement via Freedman/Azuma once (\u03b2-persistence) is established and bounded-difference increments of eH_t(H) are quantified.\n\n### Idea 5: Lower-bound direction tailored to random-k smoothing (plan refinement)\nObjective: Build an instance where \u0394(k)=1 on a 1\u2212o(1) fraction of k\u2208[k0,2k0), forcing an \u03a9(log k0) average even under random-k smoothing.\n- Construction sketch: Start from a Brunsch\u2013R\u00f6glin-type instance with one large \u201cheavy\u201d simplex cluster and many singleton \u201clight\u201d clusters positioned at radii calibrated so that each additional center mostly \u201cunlocks\u201d one light cluster at a time with only a tiny multiplicative drop in OPT (e.g., OPT_{k\u22121}/OPT_k \u2248 1 + \u0398(1/ln k0)).\n- Goal property: For most k in the window, s(k)=k\u22121, hence \u0394(k)=1 and Theorem 1 collapses to the fixed-k O(ln k) bound.\n- Next steps: Specify the radii schedule r_i to ensure OPT\u2019s discrete derivative remains within a (1+O(1/ln k0)) multiplicative gap for \u22730.9 k0 steps; then compute E_k E_++[ALG/OPT] \u2265 c ln k0 via Arthur\u2013Vassilvitskii\u2019s lower-bound methodology, adapted to the window.\n\n### Concrete next steps (verifiable)\n1) Add the \u201coptimized-\u03c4 corollary\u201d to output.md with explicit constants and a short proof (as above). This gives an easy-to-use min-of-two bound: logarithmic vs. an (m/L)-driven term.\n2) Incorporate the global min-of-two mixture bound and document the regimes it improves upon Theorem 2 (particularly when L is a moderate constant fraction of m).\n3) Formalize the 0.01-probability guarantee in the style of Idea 3, with explicit constants for C_bi=5; specify the dependence on the plateau mass p to obtain a global guarantee.\n4) Prove the expected heavy-collision bound under the \u03b2-persistence assumption cleanly (full write-up). Then investigate proving \u03b2-persistence from scale separation R\u2265k^C using the same pairwise-cost and supermartingale techniques as in MRS\u2019s covered-cost analysis.\n5) Begin crystallizing the random-k lower bound: settle a concrete radii schedule ensuring microscopic OPT drops across most of the window and work through the \u0394(k)=1 frequency.\n\n### Why these are incremental and auditable\n- All new claims are direct instantiations of Theorem 3 or straightforward corollaries (\u03c4=L\u22121, \u03c4=\u230aL/2\u230b), with explicit constants; they can be checked algebraically.\n- The probability guarantee is a direct, quantifiable application of Corollary 6 and Markov\u2019s inequality.\n- The micro-lemma isolates one probabilistic piece (expected heavy-collisions), making the remaining gap (\u03b2-persistence) explicit and testable in subsequent rounds."
