The core per-k anchor bound (Theorem 1), the pure-log plateau average (Theorem 2), the MRS-monotonicity lemma, and the tunable split (Theorem 3) with its corollaries are now in place. This gives a flexible toolkit to bound the smoothed-in-k objective via plateau decomposition.\n- In this round, I (i) isolate a couple of small clarifications and an elementary structural lemma useful for downstream applications; (ii) formalize a \u201cmin-of-extremes\u201d corollary that we can invoke plateauby-plateau without choosing \u03c4; (iii) derive explicit, checkable 1%\u2013probability guarantees under a simple plateau-length condition with constants; and (iv) propose a targeted micro-lemma (with assumptions) toward the heavy-coverage program with a clean expected-collisions bound, ready to be lifted to high probability in future rounds.\n\nGaps and clarifications for output.md\n- Edge-length remark on [k0,2k0). It will be repeatedly convenient to note that any factor-2 plateau I=[m,m+L) contained in [k0,2k0) necessarily satisfies L \u2264 2k0 \u2212 m \u2264 m (since m \u2265 k0). This was briefly mentioned in notes but not stated in output.md. Suggest adding this as a Remark after Theorem 2/Theorem 3 to justify simplifications like m/(L\u22121) \u2264 1.\n- Explicit \u201cmin-of-extremes\u201d corollary. Corollary 4 tabulates the two extreme choices \u03c4= L\u22121 and \u03c4=1. It is useful to add an explicit corollary stating that the plateau-average is bounded by the minimum of these two expressions. I state this precisely below (Corollary A) because many downstream inequalities can be derived by directly taking this min and then simplifying regime-by-regime.\n\nNew small lemmas and corollaries (clean, checkable)\n\nLemma A (Geometric constraint on plateau length).\nLet I=[m,m+L) be a factor-2 plateau contained in [k0,2k0). Then L \u2264 2k0 \u2212 m \u2264 m. In particular, m/(L\u22121) \u2265 1 for L \u2265 2.\nProof. Since the largest element in I is m+L\u22121 \u2264 2k0\u22121, we have L \u2264 2k0\u2212m. As m \u2265 k0, we get 2k0\u2212m \u2264 m. The \u201cin particular\u201d follows because L\u22121 \u2264 m\u22121 for L\u22652.\n\nCorollary A (Min-of-extremes plateau bound).\nUnder the hypotheses of Theorem 3 with L\u22653, for k uniform on I and algorithmic randomness,\nE[ ALG_k/OPT_k ] \u2264 min{ B_log, B_hyb } + (C_fix \u00b7 (ln m + O(1)))/L,\nwhere\n- B_log := 2\u00b7C_bi \u00b7 ( a + 1 + ln^+( 2m/(L\u22121) ) ),\n- B_hyb := 2\u00b7C_bi \u00b7 ( 1 + (a+ln(2m))/(L\u22121) + (m/(e(L\u22121))) \u00b7 H_{L\u22122} ),\nwith a := 2 + 1/(2e) and H_q \u2264 ln q + 1.\nProof. From Theorem 3, the two extreme choices \u03c4=L\u22121 and \u03c4=1 give the two RHS bounds (Corollary 4). Taking the minimum only tightens the inequality. Replace ln by ln^+ in B_log to weaken slightly and avoid negative logs; this is already consistent with Theorem 2.\nWhy useful. This freestates the \u201chybrid\u201d advantage without committing to \u03c4. It also enables simple regime reductions:\n- If L \u2265 \u03b1 m with \u03b1\u2208(0,1], then B_log \u2264 2\u00b7C_bi\u00b7(a+1+ln(2/\u03b1)).\n- If L is large and m/(L\u22121) \u226a 1/ln L, then B_hyb \u2264 2\u00b7C_bi\u00b7(1 + o(1) + (m/(e(L\u22121))) ln L) = O(1).\n\nCorollary B (Explicit constants for probability \u2265 1% on a long plateau).\nFix \u03b7\u2208(0,1). On a factor-2 plateau I=[m,m+L) with L\u22652 and for T := max{2, \u2308\u03b7(L\u22121)\u2309+1}, Corollary 6 implies that for at least a (1\u2212\u03b7\u2212O(1/L)) fraction of k\u2208I,\nE_++[ ALG_k/OPT_k ] \u2264 2\u00b7C_bi \u00b7 ( 1 + m/( e (T\u22121) ) ).\nIn particular, if L \u2265 \u03b1 m for some \u03b1\u2208(0,1], then for at least a (1\u2212\u03b7\u2212O(1/L)) fraction of k,\nE_++[ ALG_k/OPT_k ] \u2264 2\u00b7C_bi \u00b7 ( 1 + 1/( e \u03b1 \u03b7 ) ).\nTherefore, using Markov,\nP_{k\u2208I,++}[ ALG_k/OPT_k \u2264 100 \u00b7 2\u00b7C_bi \u00b7 ( 1 + 1/( e \u03b1 \u03b7 ) ) ] \u2265 (1\u2212\u03b7\u2212O(1/L)) \u00b7 0.99.\nConsequently, if I covers a \u03b3-fraction of [k0,2k0) (i.e., L/k0 \u2265 \u03b3), then\nP_{k\u223cU([k0,2k0)),++}[ ALG_k/OPT_k \u2264 200\u00b7C_bi \u00b7 ( 1 + 1/( e \u03b1 \u03b7 ) ) ] \u2265 \u03b3(1\u2212\u03b7\u2212O(1/L)) \u00b7 0.99.\nConcrete instantiation. Take C_bi=5 and \u03b1=1 (i.e., L \u2265 m) and \u03b7=0.99. Then with probability \u2265 \u2248 0.99\u00b7(1\u22120.99) \u2248 0.01 on k within that plateau we get E_++[ALG/OPT] \u2264 10\u00b7(1 + 1/(0.99 e)) \u2248 13.7. Markov converts this into\nP_{k,++}[ ALG/OPT \u2264 100 \u00b7 13.7 ] \u2265 0.99 on those k. Thus, if such a plateau occupies \u2265 1% of [k0,2k0), we obtain a 1% overall probability bound with an explicit constant \u2264 1370.\nWhy useful. This gives a rigorous 1%\u2013probability guarantee under a single checkable condition L \u2265 \u03b1 m on a plateau that covers a constant fraction of the window. Constants can be improved by tuning \u03b7 or by using the min-of-extremes bound when \u03b1 is moderately large.\n\nExamples and sanity checks\n- \u03b1 = 1 (maximal plateau within [k0,2k0)). Corollary A with B_log: E \u2264 2\u00b7C_bi\u00b7(a+1+ln 2) + (C_fix\u00b7(ln m)/L). With C_bi=C_fix=5, a\u22482.183, this is \u2264 10\u00b7(3.183 + 0.693) + o(1) \u2248 38.8.\n- Intermediate \u03b1. For \u03b1=1/10, B_log gives \u2264 10\u00b7(3.183 + ln 20) \u2248 10\u00b7(3.183 + 2.996) \u2248 61.8; B_hyb may improve this further when L is sufficiently large relative to m ln L.\n\nToward optimizing the \u03c4-split (next technical step)\nGoal. Select \u03c4 = \u03c4(m,L) minimizing the RHS in Theorem 3. Writing the bound (omitting absolute constants and the negligible endpoint term) as\nG(\u03c4) := (\u03c4/(L\u22121)) [a + 1 + ln(2m) \u2212 ln \u03c4] + ((L\u22121\u2212\u03c4)/(L\u22121)) + (m/(e(L\u22121))) [H_{L\u22122} \u2212 H_{\u03c4\u22121}],\nwe can approximate H_{q} \u2212 H_{p} \u2248 ln(q/p) to get\nG(\u03c4) \u2248 1 + (\u03c4/(L\u22121)) [a\u2032 + ln(2m/\u03c4)] + (m/(e(L\u22121))) ln((L\u22122)/(\u03c4\u22121)).\n- Balancing heuristic. Differentiating the approximation suggests choosing \u03c4 so that\nln(2m/\u03c4) \u2248 1 + (m/e) \u00b7 1/(\u03c4\u22121),\nwhich informally places \u03c4 near the smaller of L\u22121 and a scale \u2248 m/ln L if L is very large. This predicts the boundary-optimality of \u03c4=L\u22121 in the regime m/L \u226b ln L and of a small constant \u03c4 in the regime L \u226b m ln L, corroborating Corollary A\u2019s min-of-extremes behavior.\nActionable objective. Provide a rigorous upper envelope of the form\nE_{k\u2208I} E_++[ALG/OPT] \u2264 K0 + K1 \u00b7 min{ ln^+(2m/(L\u22121)), (m ln L)/L } + K2 \u00b7 (ln m)/L,\nby selecting \u03c4 = 1 when (m ln L)/L \u2264 c, else \u03c4 = L\u22121. Since Corollary A already yields these two regimes, formalizing the min and tracking constants is straightforward.\n\nHeavy-coverage program: an expected-collisions micro-lemma under a dominance hypothesis\nWe propose an intermediate, verifiable statement that isolates the heart of the \u201ccoverage before collisions\u201d phenomenon without yet deriving it purely from OPT-scale separation.\n\nHypothesis H(\u03b2,k1):\nLet the optimal k-partition be P = P_H \u228e P_L with |P_H| = k1. Consider k-means++ run. Let U_t(H) be the uncovered cost of heavy clusters at time t; H_t(H) the covered heavy cost proxy (use eH_t as in output.md). Assume that for all t prior to covering all heavy clusters,\nU_t(H) \u2265 \u03b2 \u00b7 ( H_t(all) + U_t(L) ).\nInterpretation. The uncovered heavy mass dominates the rest by factor \u03b2 at all intermediate times until heavy coverage is complete. This captures a strong-but-natural \u201cheavy dominance\u201d condition.\n\nLemma C (expected heavy-collision bound under H(\u03b2,k1)).\nAssume H(\u03b2,k1). Then the expected number of times k-means++ samples in a previously covered heavy cluster (a \u201cheavy collision\u201d) before all heavy clusters are covered is at most k1/\u03b2. In particular, if \u03b2 \u2265 k1\u00b7\u03ba, the expected number is \u2264 1/\u03ba.\nSketch proof.\n- At any step t before heavy coverage completes, conditional on the filtration, the probability that we sample from a covered heavy cluster is at most H_t(H) / ( U_t(H) + H_t(all) + U_t(L) ). By H(\u03b2,k1), this is \u2264 H_t(H) / ((1+1/\u03b2)U_t(H)) \u2264 1/\u03b2, since H_t(H) \u2264 U_t(H) just before the last uncovered heavy is hit (or use the supermartingale eH_t to bound H_t(H) in terms of U_t(H) with a constant factor). A more conservative inequality \u2014 replacing H_t(H) by eH_t(H) and noting eH_t(H) \u2264 5\u00b7OPT_{k1}(X) while U_t(H) remains \u2265 (\u03b2/(1+\u03b2))\u00b7cost_t(X) \u2014 yields the same 1/\u03b2 order.\n- Summing over the at most k1 draws that land in heavy clusters (each step either hits a new heavy cluster or collides within heavy), linearity of expectation gives the stated bound.\nUsefulness. Together with the MRS bi-criteria step applied after heavy coverage (oversampling the light part), this would yield an O(log(1/\u03b5)) guarantee provided \u03b2 is polynomially large in k (or even \u03b2 \u2273 k1), precisely the intuition behind Subsection 2 of task.tex. The next step is to derive H(\u03b2,k1) from a scale-separation condition (e.g., OPT_{k1} \u2265 k^C \u00b7 OPT_k) using the eH_t supermartingale and the uncovered-cost monotonicity; I will attempt this derivation next.\n\nNext steps (concrete and verifiable)\n1) Add Lemma A (L \u2264 m) and Corollary A (min-of-extremes) to output.md, with short proofs (as above).\n2) State a global 1%\u2013probability corollary (Corollary B) in output.md: if a plateau I covers a \u03b3-fraction of [k0,2k0) and satisfies L \u2265 \u03b1 m, then with probability at least 0.99\u00b7(\u03b3(1\u2212\u03b7\u2212O(1/L))) \u2265 0.01 (for suitable \u03b7,\u03b3) we get a constant-factor bound; make constants explicit with C_bi=C_fix=5.\n3) Formalize the \u201cupper envelope\u201d min{ ln^+(2m/(L\u22121)), (m ln L)/L } bound from Corollary A, tracking constants K0,K1,K2, by simply taking the min of the two extremes and simplifying H_{L\u22122} \u2264 ln(L\u22122)+1.\n4) Heavy-coverage: Under a dominance hypothesis H(\u03b2,k1), finish a rigorous proof of Lemma C by replacing the heuristic H_t(H) \u2264 U_t(H) with a clean inequality (e.g., via eH_t and stopping-time arguments) and quantify the number of heavy steps \u2264 k1. Then study sufficient conditions (in terms of OPT-scale separation) that imply H(\u03b2,k1) with \u03b2 polynomial in k.\n5) Lower bounds: Evaluate the plateau calculus on synthetic OPT profiles (e.g., OPT_k \u221d k^{-p} with p>0) to validate constant/ log log behavior; in parallel, probe whether one can enforce \u0394(k) small on most k by constructing instances with frequent large one-step drops, and quantify the resulting average using Theorem 1 (per-k anchor) directly.\n\nWhy this advances the program\n- Corollary A provides a ready-to-use bound that often gives real improvements without \u03c4-optimization.\n- Corollary B supplies rigorous \u201c\u2265 1% probability\u201d guarantees with explicit constants, addressing the alternative objective in the task statement.\n- Lemma A is a simple geometric fact used implicitly; recording it helps avoid slips when simplifying constants.\n- Lemma C frames the heavy-coverage argument into a concrete, checkable expectation bound under a clear dominance assumption, paving the way for deriving this assumption from OPT-scale separation using the MRS supermartingale machinery.\n"
