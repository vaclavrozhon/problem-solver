The core per-k anchor bound (Theorem 1), the pure-log plateau average (Theorem 2), the MRS-monotonicity lemma, and the tunable split (Theorem 3) with its corollaries are now in place. This gives a flexible toolkit to bound the smoothed-in-k objective via plateau decomposition.\\n- In this round, I (i) isolate a couple of small clarifications and an elementary structural lemma useful for downstream applications; (ii) formalize a “min-of-extremes” corollary that we can invoke plateauby-plateau without choosing τ; (iii) derive explicit, checkable 1%–probability guarantees under a simple plateau-length condition with constants; and (iv) propose a targeted micro-lemma (with assumptions) toward the heavy-coverage program with a clean expected-collisions bound, ready to be lifted to high probability in future rounds.\\n\\nGaps and clarifications for output.md\\n- Edge-length remark on [k0,2k0). It will be repeatedly convenient to note that any factor-2 plateau I=[m,m+L) contained in [k0,2k0) necessarily satisfies L ≤ 2k0 − m ≤ m (since m ≥ k0). This was briefly mentioned in notes but not stated in output.md. Suggest adding this as a Remark after Theorem 2/Theorem 3 to justify simplifications like m/(L−1) ≤ 1.\\n- Explicit “min-of-extremes” corollary. Corollary 4 tabulates the two extreme choices τ= L−1 and τ=1. It is useful to add an explicit corollary stating that the plateau-average is bounded by the minimum of these two expressions. I state this precisely below (Corollary A) because many downstream inequalities can be derived by directly taking this min and then simplifying regime-by-regime.\\n\\nNew small lemmas and corollaries (clean, checkable)\\n\\nLemma A (Geometric constraint on plateau length).\\nLet I=[m,m+L) be a factor-2 plateau contained in [k0,2k0). Then L ≤ 2k0 − m ≤ m. In particular, m/(L−1) ≥ 1 for L ≥ 2.\\nProof. Since the largest element in I is m+L−1 ≤ 2k0−1, we have L ≤ 2k0−m. As m ≥ k0, we get 2k0−m ≤ m. The “in particular” follows because L−1 ≤ m−1 for L≥2.\\n\\nCorollary A (Min-of-extremes plateau bound).\\nUnder the hypotheses of Theorem 3 with L≥3, for k uniform on I and algorithmic randomness,\\nE[ ALG_k/OPT_k ] ≤ min{ B_log, B_hyb } + (C_fix · (ln m + O(1)))/L,\\nwhere\\n- B_log := 2·C_bi · ( a + 1 + ln^+( 2m/(L−1) ) ),\\n- B_hyb := 2·C_bi · ( 1 + (a+ln(2m))/(L−1) + (m/(e(L−1))) · H_{L−2} ),\\nwith a := 2 + 1/(2e) and H_q ≤ ln q + 1.\\nProof. From Theorem 3, the two extreme choices τ=L−1 and τ=1 give the two RHS bounds (Corollary 4). Taking the minimum only tightens the inequality. Replace ln by ln^+ in B_log to weaken slightly and avoid negative logs; this is already consistent with Theorem 2.\\nWhy useful. This freestates the “hybrid” advantage without committing to τ. It also enables simple regime reductions:\\n- If L ≥ α m with α∈(0,1], then B_log ≤ 2·C_bi·(a+1+ln(2/α)).\\n- If L is large and m/(L−1) ≪ 1/ln L, then B_hyb ≤ 2·C_bi·(1 + o(1) + (m/(e(L−1))) ln L) = O(1).\\n\\nCorollary B (Explicit constants for probability ≥ 1% on a long plateau).\\nFix η∈(0,1). On a factor-2 plateau I=[m,m+L) with L≥2 and for T := max{2, ⌈η(L−1)⌉+1}, Corollary 6 implies that for at least a (1−η−O(1/L)) fraction of k∈I,\\nE_++[ ALG_k/OPT_k ] ≤ 2·C_bi · ( 1 + m/( e (T−1) ) ).\\nIn particular, if L ≥ α m for some α∈(0,1], then for at least a (1−η−O(1/L)) fraction of k,\\nE_++[ ALG_k/OPT_k ] ≤ 2·C_bi · ( 1 + 1/( e α η ) ).\\nTherefore, using Markov,\\nP_{k∈I,++}[ ALG_k/OPT_k ≤ 100 · 2·C_bi · ( 1 + 1/( e α η ) ) ] ≥ (1−η−O(1/L)) · 0.99.\\nConsequently, if I covers a γ-fraction of [k0,2k0) (i.e., L/k0 ≥ γ), then\\nP_{k∼U([k0,2k0)),++}[ ALG_k/OPT_k ≤ 200·C_bi · ( 1 + 1/( e α η ) ) ] ≥ γ(1−η−O(1/L)) · 0.99.\\nConcrete instantiation. Take C_bi=5 and α=1 (i.e., L ≥ m) and η=0.99. Then with probability ≥ ≈ 0.99·(1−0.99) ≈ 0.01 on k within that plateau we get E_++[ALG/OPT] ≤ 10·(1 + 1/(0.99 e)) ≈ 13.7. Markov converts this into\\nP_{k,++}[ ALG/OPT ≤ 100 · 13.7 ] ≥ 0.99 on those k. Thus, if such a plateau occupies ≥ 1% of [k0,2k0), we obtain a 1% overall probability bound with an explicit constant ≤ 1370.\\nWhy useful. This gives a rigorous 1%–probability guarantee under a single checkable condition L ≥ α m on a plateau that covers a constant fraction of the window. Constants can be improved by tuning η or by using the min-of-extremes bound when α is moderately large.\\n\\nExamples and sanity checks\\n- α = 1 (maximal plateau within [k0,2k0)). Corollary A with B_log: E ≤ 2·C_bi·(a+1+ln 2) + (C_fix·(ln m)/L). With C_bi=C_fix=5, a≈2.183, this is ≤ 10·(3.183 + 0.693) + o(1) ≈ 38.8.\\n- Intermediate α. For α=1/10, B_log gives ≤ 10·(3.183 + ln 20) ≈ 10·(3.183 + 2.996) ≈ 61.8; B_hyb may improve this further when L is sufficiently large relative to m ln L.\\n\\nToward optimizing the τ-split (next technical step)\\nGoal. Select τ = τ(m,L) minimizing the RHS in Theorem 3. Writing the bound (omitting absolute constants and the negligible endpoint term) as\\nG(τ) := (τ/(L−1)) [a + 1 + ln(2m) − ln τ] + ((L−1−τ)/(L−1)) + (m/(e(L−1))) [H_{L−2} − H_{τ−1}],\\nwe can approximate H_{q} − H_{p} ≈ ln(q/p) to get\\nG(τ) ≈ 1 + (τ/(L−1)) [a′ + ln(2m/τ)] + (m/(e(L−1))) ln((L−2)/(τ−1)).\\n- Balancing heuristic. Differentiating the approximation suggests choosing τ so that\\nln(2m/τ) ≈ 1 + (m/e) · 1/(τ−1),\\nwhich informally places τ near the smaller of L−1 and a scale ≈ m/ln L if L is very large. This predicts the boundary-optimality of τ=L−1 in the regime m/L ≫ ln L and of a small constant τ in the regime L ≫ m ln L, corroborating Corollary A’s min-of-extremes behavior.\\nActionable objective. Provide a rigorous upper envelope of the form\\nE_{k∈I} E_++[ALG/OPT] ≤ K0 + K1 · min{ ln^+(2m/(L−1)), (m ln L)/L } + K2 · (ln m)/L,\\nby selecting τ = 1 when (m ln L)/L ≤ c, else τ = L−1. Since Corollary A already yields these two regimes, formalizing the min and tracking constants is straightforward.\\n\\nHeavy-coverage program: an expected-collisions micro-lemma under a dominance hypothesis\\nWe propose an intermediate, verifiable statement that isolates the heart of the “coverage before collisions” phenomenon without yet deriving it purely from OPT-scale separation.\\n\\nHypothesis H(β,k1):\\nLet the optimal k-partition be P = P_H ⊎ P_L with |P_H| = k1. Consider k-means++ run. Let U_t(H) be the uncovered cost of heavy clusters at time t; H_t(H) the covered heavy cost proxy (use eH_t as in output.md). Assume that for all t prior to covering all heavy clusters,\\nU_t(H) ≥ β · ( H_t(all) + U_t(L) ).\\nInterpretation. The uncovered heavy mass dominates the rest by factor β at all intermediate times until heavy coverage is complete. This captures a strong-but-natural “heavy dominance” condition.\\n\\nLemma C (expected heavy-collision bound under H(β,k1)).\\nAssume H(β,k1). Then the expected number of times k-means++ samples in a previously covered heavy cluster (a “heavy collision”) before all heavy clusters are covered is at most k1/β. In particular, if β ≥ k1·κ, the expected number is ≤ 1/κ.\\nSketch proof.\\n- At any step t before heavy coverage completes, conditional on the filtration, the probability that we sample from a covered heavy cluster is at most H_t(H) / ( U_t(H) + H_t(all) + U_t(L) ). By H(β,k1), this is ≤ H_t(H) / ((1+1/β)U_t(H)) ≤ 1/β, since H_t(H) ≤ U_t(H) just before the last uncovered heavy is hit (or use the supermartingale eH_t to bound H_t(H) in terms of U_t(H) with a constant factor). A more conservative inequality — replacing H_t(H) by eH_t(H) and noting eH_t(H) ≤ 5·OPT_{k1}(X) while U_t(H) remains ≥ (β/(1+β))·cost_t(X) — yields the same 1/β order.\\n- Summing over the at most k1 draws that land in heavy clusters (each step either hits a new heavy cluster or collides within heavy), linearity of expectation gives the stated bound.\\nUsefulness. Together with the MRS bi-criteria step applied after heavy coverage (oversampling the light part), this would yield an O(log(1/ε)) guarantee provided β is polynomially large in k (or even β ≳ k1), precisely the intuition behind Subsection 2 of task.tex. The next step is to derive H(β,k1) from a scale-separation condition (e.g., OPT_{k1} ≥ k^C · OPT_k) using the eH_t supermartingale and the uncovered-cost monotonicity; I will attempt this derivation next.\\n\\nNext steps (concrete and verifiable)\\n1) Add Lemma A (L ≤ m) and Corollary A (min-of-extremes) to output.md, with short proofs (as above).\\n2) State a global 1%–probability corollary (Corollary B) in output.md: if a plateau I covers a γ-fraction of [k0,2k0) and satisfies L ≥ α m, then with probability at least 0.99·(γ(1−η−O(1/L))) ≥ 0.01 (for suitable η,γ) we get a constant-factor bound; make constants explicit with C_bi=C_fix=5.\\n3) Formalize the “upper envelope” min{ ln^+(2m/(L−1)), (m ln L)/L } bound from Corollary A, tracking constants K0,K1,K2, by simply taking the min of the two extremes and simplifying H_{L−2} ≤ ln(L−2)+1.\\n4) Heavy-coverage: Under a dominance hypothesis H(β,k1), finish a rigorous proof of Lemma C by replacing the heuristic H_t(H) ≤ U_t(H) with a clean inequality (e.g., via eH_t and stopping-time arguments) and quantify the number of heavy steps ≤ k1. Then study sufficient conditions (in terms of OPT-scale separation) that imply H(β,k1) with β polynomial in k.\\n5) Lower bounds: Evaluate the plateau calculus on synthetic OPT profiles (e.g., OPT_k ∝ k^{-p} with p>0) to validate constant/ log log behavior; in parallel, probe whether one can enforce Δ(k) small on most k by constructing instances with frequent large one-step drops, and quantify the resulting average using Theorem 1 (per-k anchor) directly.\\n\\nWhy this advances the program\\n- Corollary A provides a ready-to-use bound that often gives real improvements without τ-optimization.\\n- Corollary B supplies rigorous “≥ 1% probability” guarantees with explicit constants, addressing the alternative objective in the task statement.\\n- Lemma A is a simple geometric fact used implicitly; recording it helps avoid slips when simplifying constants.\\n- Lemma C frames the heavy-coverage argument into a concrete, checkable expectation bound under a clear dominance assumption, paving the way for deriving this assumption from OPT-scale separation using the MRS supermartingale machinery.\\n\"}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"auto","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"ProverOutput","schema_":{"properties":{"progress_md":{"description":"Append-only progress notes","title":"Progress Md","type":"string"}},"required":["progress_md"],"title":"ProverOutput","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":60844,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":12121,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":8832},"total_tokens":72965},"user":null,"store":true}
