  "summary_md": "Round 0003 consolidated the plateau-averaging machinery and produced several immediately usable corollaries and a clear plan for advancing heavy-coverage and lower bounds. Key technical fixes: the monotonicity lemma is now present (closing a gap in Theorem 2) and Theorem 3's tunable \u03c4-split correctly handles the \u0394=1 endpoint and the harmonic tail. Two practical corollaries were proposed: an optimized-\u03c4 (min-of-two) plateau bound with explicit constants (log vs hybrid/m/L regimes) and a global min-of-two aggregation across plateaus. A concrete 1%\u2013probability guarantee was derived under a single long-plateau condition with numeric instantiations (e.g., C_bi=5). Finally, a micro-lemma bounds expected heavy-cluster collisions under a \u03b2-persistence hypothesis; the next technical task is to derive \u03b2-persistence from OPT-scale separation. Verifier: partial success. Cited files: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json.",

    "Optimized-\u03c4 corollary: two explicit \u03c4 choices (\u03c4=L\u22121 and \u03c4=\u230aL/2\u230b) produce a simple min-of-two plateau bound (logarithmic branch vs hybrid/m-over-L branch) with explicit constants K0,K1,K2.",
    "Global aggregation: substituting the min-of-two per-plateau bound yields an averaged bound across plateaus that recovers O(log log k0) under long-plateau structure and shows plateau calculus alone cannot unconditionally beat O(log k0).",
    "Concrete 1% probability guarantees: under a plateau with L \u2265 \u03b1 m occupying fraction \u03b3 of the window, provable constant-factor bounds are given (numerical examples with C_bi=5; global prob. bounds \u2265 \u03b3\u00b70.99\u00b7(1\u22121/c) after Markov).",
    "Micro-lemma for heavy coverage: under a \u03b2-persistence assumption and scale separation \u03a3_H \u2265 R \u03a3_L, expected heavy-collisions are bounded by O(k1/(\u03b2 R)); deriving \u03b2-persistence from scale separation remains the main gap."
