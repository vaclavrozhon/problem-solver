Round 0003 consolidated the plateau-averaging machinery and produced several immediately usable corollaries and a clear plan for advancing heavy-coverage and lower bounds. Key technical fixes: the monotonicity lemma is now present (closing a gap in Theorem 2) and Theorem 3's tunable τ-split correctly handles the Δ=1 endpoint and the harmonic tail. Two practical corollaries were proposed: an optimized-τ (min-of-two) plateau bound with explicit constants (log vs hybrid/m/L regimes) and a global min-of-two aggregation across plateaus. A concrete 1%–probability guarantee was derived under a single long-plateau condition with numeric instantiations (e.g., C_bi=5). Finally, a micro-lemma bounds expected heavy-cluster collisions under a β-persistence hypothesis; the next technical task is to derive β-persistence from OPT-scale separation.
