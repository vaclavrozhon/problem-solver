Overall, both reports build on the now-correct plateau calculus (Theorems 1–3 and Corollaries 4–6). There are, however, a few precision issues that must be fixed before adding some of the suggested refinements to output.md. I summarize key points, flag correctness issues, and outline actionable next steps.

On Prover 01 (balanced split and probability guarantees):
- The proposed “balanced split” instantiation τ = ⌊L/2⌋ needs careful constants. In your displayed bound you used 1/2 as the coefficient for τ/(L−1). This is not an upper bound: for even L, τ/(L−1) = (L/2)/(L−1) > 1/2 (maximally 2/3 at L=4). Similarly, replacing ln(2m/τ) by ln(4m/L) underestimates the logarithm for odd L (where τ = (L−1)/2). To make this safe, one can uniformly bound τ/(L−1) ≤ 2/3 for L≥3 and use ln(2m/τ) ≤ ln(4m/(L−1)). For the harmonic tail H_{L−2} − H_{τ−1}, a safe universal bound for τ=⌊L/2⌋ is H_{L−2} − H_{τ−1} ≤ ln 3 + 1 for all L≥3 (with small-L cases trivial). With these corrections, a rigorous “balanced-split” bound is available, but the constants differ from those you wrote. Without these adjustments, the displayed min-of-two expression with the (m/L) term is not rigorously justified.
- The global “min-of-two mixture across plateaus” is sound in spirit. Given the issues above, the cleanest rigorous statement we can add now is the min of the two extremes already captured by Corollary 4: a log regime (τ=L−1) versus a “hybrid extreme” (τ=1), which yields an upper envelope of the form K0 + K1·min{ln^+(2m/(L−1)), (m ln L)/L} + K2·(ln m)/L. I add this as a new corollary, with explicit dependence on C_bi, C_fix but without over-optimizing constants.
- The 1% probability guarantee is correct in methodology: combine Corollary 6 (a 1−η fraction of k’s have an O(1+m/(ηL)) bound) with Markov for the ++ randomness. I add a formal corollary that cleanly states this plateau-level and globally-mixed probability bound, including the dependence on η, c, and the plateau mass γ. Your numerical examples are consistent with this template; I keep the statement symbolic with a note on how to instantiate constants.
- Heavy-coverage micro-lemma: the step “probability to sample from covered heavy ≤ E[numer]/E[denom]” is not justified; one must control E[ A_t / B_t ] directly or work conditionally on the filtration (using the D^2 sampling property given the current state) and then take expectations. Also, bounding E[H_t(covered H)] by a fixed constant times ∑_H OPT1(Q) uniformly in t needs a precise statement from MRS (e.g., the covered-cost supermartingale eH_t and its optional stopping bounds). The β-persistence condition is a reasonable placeholder, but the collision bound then needs to be derived from conditional probabilities per step, not by ratio-of-expectations. I’ve moved this idea to notes with a concrete suggestion on how to proceed: formulate everything conditional on the filtration, quantify the per-step heavy-collision probability via cost ratios, and then take expectations; seek a bound on the reduction of U_t(H) from centers outside H to justify persistence from scale separation.

On Prover 02 (min-of-extremes, geometric lemma, and probability):
- Lemma A (L ≤ m for any plateau inside [k0,2k0)) is correct and useful. However, in your “Gaps and clarifications” paragraph you wrote “justify simplifications like m/(L−1) ≤ 1”; the correct inequality is m/(L−1) ≥ 1 for L≥2 since L ≤ m. I add the lemma as a Remark with the correct direction.
- Corollary A (min-of-extremes) is valid and aligns with Corollary 4. I add an explicit “min-of-extremes” corollary for ease of invocation and then derive the upper envelope K0 + K1·min{ln^+(2m/(L−1)), (m ln L)/L} + K2·(ln m)/L by the simple H_q ≤ ln q + 1 bound. This is rigorous and will be helpful for global aggregation.
- Corollary B (1% probability): the scheme is correct. I add a formal corollary articulating the plateau-level probability and the global mixing with a plateau that occupies a γ-fraction of [k0,2k0). I keep the constants symbolic, with a note that choosing, e.g., η=0.99 and c=100 gives a ≥1% guarantee under L ≥ α m and γ ≥ a few percent; the exact numbers can be tuned.
- Heavy-coverage under H(β,k1): as stated, the proof sketch mixes an unproven claim (H_t(H) ≤ U_t(H)) with an inequality that only holds if β≥1. The right approach is conditional: at step t, P[collision within heavy | filtration] = cost(covered heavy)/cost(total), and then bound cost(covered heavy) in terms of U_t(H) via the eH_t process or another invariant; combine with a sufficient dominance condition to lower bound the denominator. I outline these steps in notes as a priority for the next round.

What I added to output.md this round
- A clean Remark recording L ≤ m for plateaus in [k0,2k0). This prevents sign slips with factors like m/(L−1).
- A min-of-extremes corollary and a resulting “upper envelope” bound K0 + K1·min{ln^+(2m/(L−1)), (m ln L)/L} + K2·(ln m)/L. This is immediately useful for global aggregation and is fully justified by Corollary 4 plus H_q ≤ ln q + 1.
- A plateau-level probability corollary (via Corollary 6 + Markov) and a global mixing statement when a plateau occupies a γ-fraction of [k0,2k0).

Next steps for provers
1) If desired, formalize a balanced-split corollary with τ=⌊L/2⌋ using safe constants: τ/(L−1) ≤ 2/3 and H_{L−2}−H_{τ−1} ≤ ln 3 + 1, and ln(2m/τ) ≤ ln(4m/(L−1)). Then compare quantitatively against the min-of-extremes envelope to see where it strictly improves constants.
2) Global aggregation: plug the new upper envelope per plateau into Corollary 3 to get an explicit global bound. Identify regimes where the (m ln L)/L term is uniformly O(1) for a constant fraction of the window.
3) Probability ≥ 1% objective: instantiate η and c to achieve a target probability and constant, under a checkable plateau-length condition L ≥ α m and plateau mass γ. Document several concrete choices.
4) Heavy-coverage: work conditionally on the filtration; quantify P[heavy collision at t | F_t] = cost(covered H)/cost(total). Seek a bound cost(covered H) ≤ K·U_t(H) (in expectation or with high probability) from MRS’s supermartingale eH_t(H). Show that centers chosen outside H reduce U_t(H) by o(U_t(H)) when heavy-scale separation holds; this would yield β-persistence and then collision control via summing per-step probabilities. Prepare a rigorous lemma with full details.
5) Lower bounds: exhibit an explicit OPT radii schedule ensuring Δ(k)=1 on a 1−o(1) fraction of k in [k0,2k0), and adapt Arthur–Vassilvitskii’s argument to get an Ω(log k0) averaged lower bound under random-k smoothing.
