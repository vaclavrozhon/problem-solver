  "feedback_md": "Overall, both reports build on the now-correct plateau calculus (Theorems 1\u20133 and Corollaries 4\u20136). There are, however, a few precision issues that must be fixed before adding some of the suggested refinements to output.md. I summarize key points, flag correctness issues, and outline actionable next steps.\n\nOn Prover 01 (balanced split and probability guarantees):\n- The proposed \u201cbalanced split\u201d instantiation \u03c4 = \u230aL/2\u230b needs careful constants. In your displayed bound you used 1/2 as the coefficient for \u03c4/(L\u22121). This is not an upper bound: for even L, \u03c4/(L\u22121) = (L/2)/(L\u22121) > 1/2 (maximally 2/3 at L=4). Similarly, replacing ln(2m/\u03c4) by ln(4m/L) underestimates the logarithm for odd L (where \u03c4 = (L\u22121)/2). To make this safe, one can uniformly bound \u03c4/(L\u22121) \u2264 2/3 for L\u22653 and use ln(2m/\u03c4) \u2264 ln(4m/(L\u22121)). For the harmonic tail H_{L\u22122} \u2212 H_{\u03c4\u22121}, a safe universal bound for \u03c4=\u230aL/2\u230b is H_{L\u22122} \u2212 H_{\u03c4\u22121} \u2264 ln 3 + 1 for all L\u22653 (with small-L cases trivial). With these corrections, a rigorous \u201cbalanced-split\u201d bound is available, but the constants differ from those you wrote. Without these adjustments, the displayed min-of-two expression with the (m/L) term is not rigorously justified.\n- The global \u201cmin-of-two mixture across plateaus\u201d is sound in spirit. Given the issues above, the cleanest rigorous statement we can add now is the min of the two extremes already captured by Corollary 4: a log regime (\u03c4=L\u22121) versus a \u201chybrid extreme\u201d (\u03c4=1), which yields an upper envelope of the form K0 + K1\u00b7min{ln^+(2m/(L\u22121)), (m ln L)/L} + K2\u00b7(ln m)/L. I add this as a new corollary, with explicit dependence on C_bi, C_fix but without over-optimizing constants.\n- The 1% probability guarantee is correct in methodology: combine Corollary 6 (a 1\u2212\u03b7 fraction of k\u2019s have an O(1+m/(\u03b7L)) bound) with Markov for the ++ randomness. I add a formal corollary that cleanly states this plateau-level and globally-mixed probability bound, including the dependence on \u03b7, c, and the plateau mass \u03b3. Your numerical examples are consistent with this template; I keep the statement symbolic with a note on how to instantiate constants.\n- Heavy-coverage micro-lemma: the step \u201cprobability to sample from covered heavy \u2264 E[numer]/E[denom]\u201d is not justified; one must control E[ A_t / B_t ] directly or work conditionally on the filtration (using the D^2 sampling property given the current state) and then take expectations. Also, bounding E[H_t(covered H)] by a fixed constant times \u2211_H OPT1(Q) uniformly in t needs a precise statement from MRS (e.g., the covered-cost supermartingale eH_t and its optional stopping bounds). The \u03b2-persistence condition is a reasonable placeholder, but the collision bound then needs to be derived from conditional probabilities per step, not by ratio-of-expectations. I\u2019ve moved this idea to notes with a concrete suggestion on how to proceed: formulate everything conditional on the filtration, quantify the per-step heavy-collision probability via cost ratios, and then take expectations; seek a bound on the reduction of U_t(H) from centers outside H to justify persistence from scale separation.\n\nOn Prover 02 (min-of-extremes, geometric lemma, and probability):\n- Lemma A (L \u2264 m for any plateau inside [k0,2k0)) is correct and useful. However, in your \u201cGaps and clarifications\u201d paragraph you wrote \u201cjustify simplifications like m/(L\u22121) \u2264 1\u201d; the correct inequality is m/(L\u22121) \u2265 1 for L\u22652 since L \u2264 m. I add the lemma as a Remark with the correct direction.\n- Corollary A (min-of-extremes) is valid and aligns with Corollary 4. I add an explicit \u201cmin-of-extremes\u201d corollary for ease of invocation and then derive the upper envelope K0 + K1\u00b7min{ln^+(2m/(L\u22121)), (m ln L)/L} + K2\u00b7(ln m)/L by the simple H_q \u2264 ln q + 1 bound. This is rigorous and will be helpful for global aggregation.\n- Corollary B (1% probability): the scheme is correct. I add a formal corollary articulating the plateau-level probability and the global mixing with a plateau that occupies a \u03b3-fraction of [k0,2k0). I keep the constants symbolic, with a note that choosing, e.g., \u03b7=0.99 and c=100 gives a \u22651% guarantee under L \u2265 \u03b1 m and \u03b3 \u2265 a few percent; the exact numbers can be tuned.\n- Heavy-coverage under H(\u03b2,k1): as stated, the proof sketch mixes an unproven claim (H_t(H) \u2264 U_t(H)) with an inequality that only holds if \u03b2\u22651. The right approach is conditional: at step t, P[collision within heavy | filtration] = cost(covered heavy)/cost(total), and then bound cost(covered heavy) in terms of U_t(H) via the eH_t process or another invariant; combine with a sufficient dominance condition to lower bound the denominator. I outline these steps in notes as a priority for the next round.\n\nWhat I added to output.md this round\n- A clean Remark recording L \u2264 m for plateaus in [k0,2k0). This prevents sign slips with factors like m/(L\u22121).\n- A min-of-extremes corollary and a resulting \u201cupper envelope\u201d bound K0 + K1\u00b7min{ln^+(2m/(L\u22121)), (m ln L)/L} + K2\u00b7(ln m)/L. This is immediately useful for global aggregation and is fully justified by Corollary 4 plus H_q \u2264 ln q + 1.\n- A plateau-level probability corollary (via Corollary 6 + Markov) and a global mixing statement when a plateau occupies a \u03b3-fraction of [k0,2k0).\n\nNext steps for provers\n1) If desired, formalize a balanced-split corollary with \u03c4=\u230aL/2\u230b using safe constants: \u03c4/(L\u22121) \u2264 2/3 and H_{L\u22122}\u2212H_{\u03c4\u22121} \u2264 ln 3 + 1, and ln(2m/\u03c4) \u2264 ln(4m/(L\u22121)). Then compare quantitatively against the min-of-extremes envelope to see where it strictly improves constants.\n2) Global aggregation: plug the new upper envelope per plateau into Corollary 3 to get an explicit global bound. Identify regimes where the (m ln L)/L term is uniformly O(1) for a constant fraction of the window.\n3) Probability \u2265 1% objective: instantiate \u03b7 and c to achieve a target probability and constant, under a checkable plateau-length condition L \u2265 \u03b1 m and plateau mass \u03b3. Document several concrete choices.\n4) Heavy-coverage: work conditionally on the filtration; quantify P[heavy collision at t | F_t] = cost(covered H)/cost(total). Seek a bound cost(covered H) \u2264 K\u00b7U_t(H) (in expectation or with high probability) from MRS\u2019s supermartingale eH_t(H). Show that centers chosen outside H reduce U_t(H) by o(U_t(H)) when heavy-scale separation holds; this would yield \u03b2-persistence and then collision control via summing per-step probabilities. Prepare a rigorous lemma with full details.\n5) Lower bounds: exhibit an explicit OPT radii schedule ensuring \u0394(k)=1 on a 1\u2212o(1) fraction of k in [k0,2k0), and adapt Arthur\u2013Vassilvitskii\u2019s argument to get an \u03a9(log k0) averaged lower bound under random-k smoothing.\n",
  "new_notes_md": "Additions and clarifications\n\n- Geometric constraint on plateau length within the window. If a factor-2 plateau I=[m,m+L) is contained in [k0,2k0), then L \u2264 2k0\u2212m \u2264 m. In particular, for L\u22652 we have m/(L\u22121) \u2265 1. This prevents sign errors when simplifying expressions involving m/(L\u22121).\n\n- Min-of-extremes and an upper envelope. From Theorem 3 and Corollary 4 we can (and will) use the minimum of the two extreme instantiations \u03c4=L\u22121 (pure log) and \u03c4=1 (hybrid extreme). Using H_q \u2264 ln q + 1, this yields a clean per-plateau upper envelope of the form\n  E_{k\u2208I} E_++[ALG_k/OPT_k] \u2264 K0 + K1 \u00b7 min{ ln^+(2m/(L\u22121)), (m ln L)/L } + K2 \u00b7 (ln m)/L,\nfor absolute constants K0,K1,K2 depending only on C_bi,C_fix. This is the regime split we will use in global aggregation: the log term dominates when L\u226am, while the (m ln L)/L term is O(1) when L is a constant fraction of m.\n\n- Safe balanced-split (\u03c4=\u230aL/2\u230b) template (optional). The following uniform bounds hold for L\u22653 and \u03c4=\u230aL/2\u230b:\n  \u2022 \u03c4/(L\u22121) \u2264 2/3 and (L\u22121\u2212\u03c4)/(L\u22121) \u2264 1/2.\n  \u2022 ln(2m/\u03c4) \u2264 ln(4m/(L\u22121)).\n  \u2022 H_{L\u22122} \u2212 H_{\u03c4\u22121} \u2264 ln 3 + 1 (with small-L cases checked directly).\nPlugging these into Theorem 3 yields the rigorous estimate\n  E_{k\u2208I} E_++[ALG_k/OPT_k]\n  \u2264 2C_bi [ (2/3)(a + 1 + ln(4m/(L\u22121))) + 1/2 + (m/(e(L\u22121)))(ln 3 + 1) ]\n    + (C_fix(\\ln m + O(1)))/L.\nThis improves the (m ln L)/L term to a pure (m/L) term at the expense of a larger coefficient on the logarithmic piece. It may be tighter than the min-of-extremes envelope in intermediate regimes. If used, constants must be kept as above (1/2 is not a safe coefficient for \u03c4/(L\u22121) when L is even).\n\n- Probability \u2265 1% guarantees under a long-plateau condition. From Corollary 6: fix \u03b7\u2208(0,1) and define T := max{2, \u2308\u03b7(L\u22121)\u2309+1}. For at least a (1\u2212\u03b7\u2212O(1/L)) fraction of k\u2208I we have\n  E_++[ALG_k/OPT_k] \u2264 2C_bi (1 + m/(e(T\u22121))).\nBy Markov, for any c\u22651,\n  P_{++}[ ALG_k/OPT_k \u2264 c \u00b7 2C_bi (1 + m/(e(T\u22121))) ] \u2265 1 \u2212 1/c\nfor each such k. Therefore, jointly over k uniform on I and ++ randomness,\n  P[ ALG_k/OPT_k \u2264 c \u00b7 2C_bi (1 + m/(e(T\u22121))) ] \u2265 (1\u2212\u03b7\u2212O(1/L))(1\u22121/c).\nIf L \u2265 \u03b1 m, then m/(T\u22121) \u2264 1/(\u03b1 \u03b7) up to 1+O(1/L) factors, giving an explicit constant bound. If the plateau covers a \u03b3-fraction of [k0,2k0), the global probability is \u2265 \u03b3 times the RHS. Example: with C_bi=5, \u03b1=1, \u03b7=0.99, c=100, we get a \u22651% guarantee with a factor \u2264 100\u00b72\u00b75\u00b7(1 + 1/(0.99 e)).\n\n- Heavy-coverage program (caveats and plan). Any per-step \u201ccollision within heavy\u201d probability bound must be stated conditionally on the current filtration F_t: under D^2 sampling,\n  P[collision in H at step t | F_t] = cost_t(covered H) / cost_t(all).\nAvoid ratio-of-expectations. A plausible route is to bound cost_t(covered H) in terms of the uncovered heavy mass U_t(H) via the MRS eH_t supermartingale (in expectation and eventually with concentration), while lower bounding cost_t(all) by U_t(H) + U_t(L). To obtain a \u03b2-persistence-type condition from scale separation, quantify the expected reduction of U_t(H) when sampling outside H and show it is o(U_t(H)) under strong separation (e.g., OPT_{k1} \u2265 k^C \u00b7 OPT_k). With these in place, the expected number of heavy collisions can be bounded by summing the conditional probabilities until all heavy clusters are hit, and then lifted to high probability by Freedman/Azuma.\n\n- Lower bounds. To show random-k smoothing cannot beat \u0398(log k0) in general, aim for an instance where \u0394(k)=1 for a 1\u2212o(1) fraction of k in [k0,2k0). Concretely, calibrate radii so OPT_{k\u22121}/OPT_k \u2248 1 + \u0398(1/ln k0) across most of the window, ensuring s(k)=k\u22121 on most k. Then adapt Arthur\u2013Vassilvitskii\u2019s lower-bound calculation to the averaged setting.\n",
