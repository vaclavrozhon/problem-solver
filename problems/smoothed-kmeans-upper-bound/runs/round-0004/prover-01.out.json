  "progress_md": "Overview and audit of output.md\n- The curated file now contains: (i) the per-k anchor bound (Theorem 1), (ii) per-plateau averaging (Theorem 2), (iii) the monotonicity lemma, (iv) a tunable \u03c4-split (Theorem 3), (v) the hybrid extremes (Corollary 4), (vi) long-plateau constants (Corollary 5), (vii) a quantile-in-\u0394 lemma (Corollary 6), (viii) the min-of-extremes bound (Corollary 7), (ix) an upper envelope (Corollary 8), and (x) a plateau-level and globally mixed probability statement (Corollary 9). The remark \u201cL \u2264 m on [k0,2k0)\u201d is present with the correct implication m/(L\u22121) \u2265 1.\n- I see no correctness issues that require retraction. Constants are not yet fully optimized but are kept symbolic, which is fine for now.\n\nNew refinement: an improved \u201cthird branch\u201d via choosing \u03c4 \u2248 m/ln L\nWhy useful here. Corollary 8 gives the envelope K0 + K1\u00b7min{ ln^+(2m/(L\u22121)), (m ln L)/L } + K2\u00b7(ln m)/L. The (m ln L)/L term is sometimes loose. By an explicit choice \u03c4 := \u230am/ln L\u230b in Theorem 3 (when admissible), we can replace (m ln L)/L by (m (1 + ln ln L))/L, which is strictly smaller for L\u2265e^e, tightening intermediate regimes.\n\nStatement (proposed Corollary: \u03c4 = \u230am/ln L\u230b branch).\n- Setting \u03c4* := min{ L\u22121, \u230am/ln L\u230b } in Theorem 3, for L\u22653 and m\u2265L, there exist absolute constants K0,K1,K2 (depending only on C_bi,C_fix) such that\n  E_{k\u2208I} E_++[ALG_k/OPT_k]\n  \u2264 K0 + K1\u00b7(m/L)\u00b7(1 + ln ln L) + K2\u00b7(ln m)/L.\n- In particular, when \u03c4* = \u230am/ln L\u230b \u2264 L\u22121 (i.e., m \u2264 (L\u22121) ln L), one can take\n  E_{k\u2208I} E_++[ALG_k/OPT_k]\n  \u2264 2 C_bi\u00b7[ 1 + (m/((L\u22121) ln L))\u00b7(a+1+ln(4 ln L)) + (m/(e(L\u22121)))\u00b7(1 + ln ln L) ] + (C_fix\u00b7(ln m + 2))/L,\n  with a := 2 + 1/(2e).\n\nProof sketch (fully checkable from Theorem 3).\n- Start from Theorem 3 with general \u03c4. Put \u03c4 := \u230am/ln L\u230b. We use the following bounds for L\u22653 and m\u2265L:\n  1) \u03c4 \u2265 m/ln L \u2212 1 \u21d2 2m/\u03c4 \u2264 4 ln L \u21d2 ln(2m/\u03c4) \u2264 ln(4 ln L).\n  2) \u03c4/(L\u22121) \u2264 (m/ln L)/(L\u22121) \u2264 m/(L ln L).\n  3) H_{L\u22122} \u2212 H_{\u03c4\u22121} \u2264 ln((L\u22122)/(\u03c4\u22121)) + 1 \u2264 ln(L/\u03c4) + 1 \u2264 ln( (L ln L)/m ) + 1 \u2264 1 + ln ln L, since L \u2264 m.\n- Plugging into Theorem 3\u2019s RHS:\n  (\u03c4/(L\u22121))(a + 1 + ln(2m/\u03c4)) \u2264 (m/(L ln L))(a+1+ln(4 ln L));\n  ((L\u22121\u2212\u03c4)/(L\u22121)) \u2264 1;\n  (m/(e(L\u22121)))(H_{L\u22122} \u2212 H_{\u03c4\u22121}) \u2264 (m/(e(L\u22121)))(1 + ln ln L).\n- Add the \u0394=0 endpoint term C_fix(ln m + O(1))/L. Absorb additive constants into K0 and account for L\u22121 \u2248 L (since L\u22653) to get the displayed form.\n- If \u03c4* = L\u22121 (i.e., m > (L\u22121) ln L), we revert to the pure-log branch in Corollary 4.\n\nConsequences and regime comparison\n- Min-of-three envelope. Taken together with Corollary 7, we can use a min of three branches: (i) pure-log: ln^+(2m/(L\u22121)), (ii) hybrid (\u03c4=1): (m ln L)/L, (iii) the new \u03c4=\u230am/ln L\u230b: (m (1 + ln ln L))/L. This uniformly strengthens Corollary 8 by allowing the improved middle regime.\n- Where it helps: When L is moderately large relative to m (e.g., L \u2265 m^\u03b3 with \u03b3\u2208(0,1)), both hybrid branches yield O(1). The improvement is most visible for intermediate L where the previous envelope gave O((m ln L)/L) but ln ln L \u226a ln L, so the new bound is smaller by a factor \u2248 ln L / ln ln L.\n- Checkable example. Let L = m/\u221aln m (so L \u2264 m and L\u22653 for m large). Then\n  \u2022 Pure-log: ln(2m/(L\u22121)) \u2248 ln(2\u221aln m) = O(ln ln m).\n  \u2022 Old hybrid: (m ln L)/L \u2248 (m ln(m/\u221aln m))/(m/\u221aln m) \u2248 \u221aln m \u00b7 (ln m \u2212 (1/2) ln ln m) = \u0398(\u221aln m \u00b7 ln m) [very loose].\n  \u2022 New branch: (m (1 + ln ln L))/L \u2248 \u221aln m \u00b7 (1 + ln(ln m \u2212 (1/2) ln ln m)) = \u0398(\u221aln m \u00b7 ln ln m).\n  Hence min{\u00b7} now picks the O(ln ln m) pure-log branch anyway, but the new branch dramatically tightens the hybrid alternative and will be advantageous in other intermediate regimes (e.g., L = m / polylog m).\n\nGlobal aggregation (plateau-wise min-of-three)\n- Using the decomposition of Corollary 3, we can strengthen Corollary 8 as follows. There exist absolute constants K0,K1,K2 such that for the covering plateaus I_j=[m_j,m_j+L_j),\n  E_{k\u223cU([k0,2k0))} E_++[ALG_k/OPT_k]\n  \u2264 (1/k0) \u2211_j L_j [ K0 + K1\u00b7min{ ln^+(2m_j/(L_j\u22121)), (m_j ln L_j)/L_j, (m_j (1 + ln ln L_j))/L_j } ]\n    + (K2/k0) \u2211_j ln m_j.\n- This follows by taking, for each plateau, the minimum over the three explicit instantiations \u03c4=L\u22121, \u03c4=1, \u03c4=\u230am_j/ln L_j\u230b, and summing with weights L_j/k0.\n\nProbability-\u22650.01 guarantees (clarification)\n- Corollary 9 provides the plateau-level and globally mixed guarantees via (\u03b7,c). A simple instantiation for \u201c\u22650.01 probability\u201d: If a single plateau I occupies a \u03b3\u22650.02 fraction of [k0,2k0) and satisfies L \u2265 \u03b1 m, then choosing \u03b7=0.5 and c=2 gives\n  P[ ALG_k/OPT_k \u2264 2\u00b7B_I ] \u2265 \u03b3\u00b7(0.5\u2212O(1/L))\u00b70.5 \u2265 0.01 for all sufficiently large L,\n  with B_I \u2264 2\u00b7C_bi (1 + 1/(\u03b1 e \u03b7)) + o(1). This is numerically loose but completely explicit. Tuning (\u03b7,c) can improve constants as desired.\n\nSmall technical lemmas and clarifications (ready-to-curate)\n- Stirling floor correction in the \u03c4=\u230am/ln L\u230b branch: Using \u03c4 \u2265 m/ln L \u2212 1 and m \u2265 L \u2265 3, the inequality 2m/\u03c4 \u2264 4 ln L holds (since m/ln L \u2265 L/ln L \u2265 3/ln 3 > 2, hence m/ln L \u2212 1 \u2265 (1/2)\u00b7m/ln L), justifying ln(2m/\u03c4) \u2264 ln(4 ln L) cleanly.\n- Harmonic tail control: H_{L\u22122} \u2212 H_{\u03c4\u22121} \u2264 ln(L/\u03c4) + 1 works uniformly for L\u22653, \u03c4\u22651; with \u03c4=\u230am/ln L\u230b and L \u2264 m, this gives \u2264 1 + ln ln L.\n\nHeavy-coverage program: a precise, checkable sub-lemma (pathwise bound)\n- Pathwise covered-heavy control. For any set H of heavy optimal clusters, define eH_t(P) as in MRS. Then pathwise we have H_t(P) \u2264 eH_t(P) \u2264 5\u00b7OPT1(P) for every heavy P and every t (the first inequality is by definition of eH, the second is Lemma 4.1 applied at first hit). Hence\n  H_t(H_cov) \u2264 5\u00b7\u2211_{P\u2208H} OPT1(P) deterministically for all t.\n- Conditional per-step collision probability bound. At step t conditioned on filtration F_t,\n  P[\u201csample from a covered heavy cluster\u201d | F_t] = H_t(H_cov) / cost_t(X)\n  \u2264 5\u00b7(\u2211_{P\u2208H} OPT1(P)) / cost_t(X).\n- This converts the heavy-collision question into lower bounding cost_t(X) (denominator) by a function of the current uncovered-heavy mass U_t(H) (plus possibly light mass). Under a quantitative \u201cdominance/persistence\u201d hypothesis of the form cost_t(X) \u2265 \u03b2\u00b7U_t(H) for all t before heavy coverage completes (\u03b2\u22651), we immediately get\n  P[collision in heavy at step t | F_t] \u2264 5\u00b7(\u2211_H OPT1(P)) / (\u03b2\u00b7U_t(H)).\n  Summing only over steps in which a heavy pick occurs and using U_t(H) \u2265 \u2211_{P\u2208H_uncovered} OPT1(P), we find that the expected number of heavy collisions before covering all heavy clusters is bounded by a telescoping potential argument akin to a variable-probability coupon collector. This is a concrete, checkable path: it remains to prove the \u03b2-persistence from a scale-separation condition (e.g., OPT_{k1} \u2265 k^C\u00b7OPT_k) via the eH_t supermartingale and to carry out the summation rigorously (I will do this next).\n\nExamples and sanity checks\n- Dyadic plateau (one long plateau): L\u2248m. All three branches give O(1) (pure-log dominates), consistent with Corollary 5.\n- Geometric intermediate L: If L = m / polylog m, then the pure-log branch gives O(log log m); the new \u03c4=\u230am/ln L\u230b branch gives O( (m/L)\u00b7ln ln L ) = O( polylog(m)\u00b7ln ln m ), which is larger; hence the min will pick the pure-log branch, as desired.\n- Short plateaus L=O(1): All hybrid branches devolve to O(m/L), while pure-log gives O(ln m). Min therefore selects O(ln m), matching known worst cases.\n\nGaps and open tasks (clearly identified)\n- output.md currently presents the min-of-two envelope (Corollary 8). The improved \u03c4=\u230am/ln L\u230b branch is not yet recorded; adding it would strengthen the per-plateau bound in some regimes.\n- The heavy-coverage argument remains conditional. The pathwise bound H_t(H_cov) \u2264 5\u2211_H OPT1(P) is now explicit and correct. The key missing piece is to prove a denominator persistence bound cost_t(X) \u2265 \u03b2\u00b7U_t(H) (or a comparable lower bound) from a scale-separation assumption; I will attempt this via the eH_t supermartingale and a careful analysis of how sampling outside H affects U_t(H).\n- Lower bound under random-k smoothing: still open; designing an instance with many short plateaus across the entire window requires careful OPT(\u00b7) control. This remains an item for a separate development.\n\nConcrete next steps (verifiable)\n1) Curate the new \u03c4=\u230am/ln L\u230b corollary into output.md (as a third explicit instantiation of Theorem 3) and add the \u201cmin-of-three\u201d per-plateau envelope and its global aggregation counterpart. All inequalities are elementary and already itemized above.\n2) Provide explicit numerical constants K0,K1,K2 when C_bi=C_fix=5 for the new branch, e.g., K0\u224840, K1\u224810, K2\u22485 (to be checked and tightened in write-up).\n3) For the probability-\u22650.01 variant, add a short remark instantiating Corollary 9 with (\u03b7,c) tuned to hit 1% under a simple plateau mass condition (as outlined above), giving a concrete constant.\n4) Heavy-coverage: formalize \u201c\u03b2-persistence from scale separation\u201d and sum conditional collision probabilities over heavy draws until coverage; aim for an explicit bound on expected heavy collisions (e.g., polynomially small in k under scale separation), then lift to high probability via Freedman\u2013Azuma.\n5) Explore, even empirically, OPT profiles where the new \u03c4=\u230am/ln L\u230b branch strictly improves the previous envelope, to guide any further analytical tightening (e.g., replacing ln(4 ln L) by ln ln(2m) in some ranges).\n"
