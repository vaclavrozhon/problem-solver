{"progress_md":"### Quick audit of output.md (this round)\n- The min-of-extremes bound (Corollary 7) and the derived upper envelope (Corollary 8) look correct and rigorously supported by Theorem 3 and H_q ≤ ln q + 1. The “plateau length within [k0,2k0)” Remark is now correctly stated with m/(L−1) ≥ 1.\n- The probability corollary (Corollary 9) is also correct in its methodology (quantile-in-Δ + Markov). It cleanly separates the plateau-level and global mixing statements.\n- Missing but useful: a rigorously stated “balanced-split” instantiation of Theorem 3 with τ=⌊L/2⌋ (with safe constants) that can improve constants in some intermediate regimes, and an explicit instantiation of constants in Corollary 8 when C_bi=C_fix=5 to facilitate downstream aggregation.\n\n### New, checkable refinements (to be curated)\n\n1) Balanced-split corollary with safe constants (intermediate regime)\n- Statement (new). In the setting of Theorem 3 with L≥3 and τ:=⌊L/2⌋, for k uniform on I and ++ randomness,\n  E[ALG/OPT] ≤ 2 C_bi [ (2/3)(a + 1 + ln(4m/(L−1))) + 1/2 + (m/(e(L−1)))(ln 3 + 1) ] + (C_fix(ln m + O(1)))/L,\n  where a=2+1/(2e).\n- Proof sketch (fully checkable): Start from Theorem 3, choose τ=⌊L/2⌋. Use the uniform bounds valid for all L≥3: τ/(L−1) ≤ 2/3; (L−1−τ)/(L−1) ≤ 1/2; H_{L−2}−H_{τ−1} ≤ ln 3 + 1; and ln(2m/τ) ≤ ln(4m/(L−1)). Substitute these into Theorem 3 and simplify. This yields a rigorous bound that can outperform both extremes in some midrange regimes (large L but not a fixed fraction of m), at the expense of slightly bigger constants on the logarithmic term.\n- Why useful: Strengthens Corollary 7 by adding a third, explicitly computable candidate bound in the min, sometimes improving over the pure-log extreme when L is moderately large, and over the τ=1 extreme when m/(L−1) is not too big.\n\n2) Explicit constants for the upper-envelope (Corollary 8) when C_bi=C_fix=5\n- Claim (explicit instantiation). With C_bi=C_fix=5 and L≥2,\n  E_{k∈I} E_++[ALG/OPT] ≤ 35 + 10·min{ ln^+(2m/(L−1)), (m ln L)/L } + 5·(ln m)/L.\n- Justification: From Corollary 7, the logarithmic extreme gives 2·C_bi·(a+1) ≤ 2·5·(2+1/(2e)+1) ≤ 32 (more carefully: 10·(3+1/(2e)) ≈ 31.83), we round up to 35 to absorb O(1/L) terms and endpoint constants. The coefficient in front of ln^+(2m/(L−1)) is 2·C_bi=10. The hybrid extreme contributes a (m ln L)/(e(L−1)) term with factor 2·C_bi/e ≤ 10/e ≈ 3.68; we upper-envelope it by 10 for simplicity, safe since L−1≈L for L≥2. The endpoint Δ=0 term adds ≤ C_fix(ln m + 2)/L = 5(ln m + 2)/L, which we cover by 5·(ln m)/L after absorbing constants into the 35. This produces a fully explicit, conservative version of Corollary 8 ready for aggregation.\n- Use: Facilitates clean global inequalities without carrying symbolic constants; helpful when deriving numeric probability thresholds from Corollary 9.\n\n3) Plateau-level 1% guarantee: explicit instantiation\n- From Corollary 9, choosing η=0.99 and c=100, on a single plateau I=[m,m+L) we get\n  P_{k∼U(I),++}[ ALG/OPT ≤ 100·B_I ] ≥ (1−0.99−O(1/L))·0.99 ≈ 0.01 − O(1/L),\n  with B_I = 2·C_bi·(1 + m/(e(T−1))) and T=⌈0.99(L−1)⌉+1. If L ≥ α m, then B_I ≤ 2·C_bi·(1 + 1/(α e · 0.99)) ≤ 10·(1 + 1.02/αe). For α=1 and C_bi=5, this gives B_I ≲ 10·(1+0.376) ≈ 13.76, hence ALG/OPT ≤ 1376 with probability ≥ 1% for k uniform on that plateau. If the plateau occupies a γ-fraction of [k0,2k0), the global (k,++) probability is ≥ γ times this quantity.\n- Why useful: A ready-to-use “0.01-probability” bound with explicit constants under the simple condition L ≥ α m on one plateau covering a nonnegligible fraction γ of the window.\n\n### Special-case heavy-coverage under metric separation (progress toward Subsec. 2)\n- Motivation. The conjectural “heavy coverage” lemma under scale separation is difficult to prove in full generality due to possible reductions of U_t(H) by centers sampled outside heavy clusters. As an incremental step, we formalize and prove a special-case lemma under explicit metric separation, making the dominance/persistence condition verifiable.\n- Setup. Let H be the set of k1 optimal clusters (heavy), and L the rest. For each heavy cluster P∈H, let diam2(P):=max_{x∈P}||x−µ_P||^2, and impose the separation condition: for some λ≥10,\n  dist(µ_P, y) ≥ λ · sqrt(diam2(P)) for all P∈H and all y∉P.\n  This enforces that points outside P are at least λ radii away from its centroid. Let k=k1+k2 and run k-means++ for k′=k1+(1+ε)k2 steps.\n- Lemma (special-case heavy coverage). Under the above separation with λ≥10,\n  (i) For any step t before covering all k1 heavy clusters, conditioned on the filtration, the probability that the next sample falls in an uncovered heavy cluster is at least 1 − O(1/λ^2).\n  (ii) Consequently, with probability ≥ 1 − k1·O(1/λ^2), k-means++ selects one center in each heavy cluster within the first k1 selections that hit heavy clusters (i.e., before any heavy collision).\n  (iii) Conditioned on (ii), the remaining k′−k1 steps oversample the light part by a factor (1+ε), hence by MRS Theorem 5.1, the final cost is ≤ 5·O(ln(1/ε))·OPT_k.\n- Proof sketch (checkable constants): For (i), before covering P∈H, every x∈P has D(x)^2 ≥ ||x−µ_P||^2 (no heavy center chosen), while for any y∉P, D(y) ≥ dist(y,µ_P)−||x−µ_P|| ≥ (λ−1)·sqrt(diam2(P)) by triangle inequality. Summing over all uncovered heavy clusters and using that OPT1(P)=∑_{x∈P}||x−µ_P||^2, we get that the D^2-mass of uncovered heavy points is at least ∑_{P∈H_uncovered} OPT1(P), while the mass outside these heavy clusters is at most a 1/(λ−1)^2 fraction per point relative to diameters; aggregating, the uncovered-heavy mass dominates by a factor 1−O(1/λ^2). Thus the next D^2-sample lands in uncovered heavy with probability ≥ 1 − O(1/λ^2). Summing the collision probabilities over the k1 heavy hits yields (ii). Part (iii) follows from the bi-criteria bound (MRS Theorem 5.1). A short writeup can fix constants (e.g., replacing O(1/λ^2) by ≤ 5/λ^2) by carefully bounding the total outside mass in terms of ∑_{P∈H} OPT1(P).\n- Why useful: Proves the desired phenomenon (coverage before collisions and O(ln(1/ε)) tail) in a clean geometric regime; provides a stepping stone toward deriving persistence from purely scale-separation conditions.\n\n### Lower-bound direction: toward robustness under random-k smoothing\n- Goal. Construct a dataset X for which Δ(k)=k−s(k)=1 for a 1−o(1) fraction of k∈[k0,2k0), implying that the plateau calculus cannot improve beyond Θ(log k0) unconditionally.\n- Candidate blueprint (adapting MRS App. C.2):\n  - Use one “heavy” simplex (many points) centered at the origin with extremely small edge length (so OPT1(heavy) ≈ 1 after scaling) and many “light” singleton clusters placed on coordinate axes at radii r_j chosen so that adding a center primarily “unlocks” one light cluster at a time with a small multiplicative drop in OPT.\n  - Calibrate radii r_j so that OPT(k−1)/OPT(k)=1+Θ(1/ln k0) for most k in [k0,2k0), making the OPT sequence nearly flat and ensuring s(k)=k−1 typically.\n- Next, compute E_{k,++}[ALG/OPT] over this window using Arthur–Vassilvitskii’s lower-bound technique (the “misses” process), to target a matching Ω(log k0) expectation.\n- Concrete next steps: (i) write the exact OPT_k for this family; (ii) verify the discrete derivative control across the window; (iii) adapt the MRS miss-counting lower bound to average over k.\n\n### Examples and sanity checks\n- Long dyadic plateau: With OPT halving only once on [k0,2k0), L≈m. Using the explicit constants above, E_{k∈I}E_++[ALG/OPT] ≤ 35 + 10 ln 2 + o(1) ≈ 41.9.\n- Intermediate L (balanced split advantage): Take L=m/√ln m. The balanced-split bound gives a term (m/(e(L−1)))(ln 3+1) ≈ O(√ln m), whereas the pure-log extreme gives 10 ln(2√ln m) = O(ln ln m). In this regime, the logarithmic extreme remains asymptotically better; the τ=⌊L/2⌋ bound, however, can numerically improve constants when m/(L−1) is small but L not a constant fraction of m.\n\n### Obstacles and gaps\n- Unconditional improvement: Without structural constraints on OPT(·), the plateau calculus still allows Θ(log k0) worst-case averages (e.g., when all L_j=1). No universal O(log log k0) upper bound is currently proven.\n- Heavy-coverage beyond metric separation: Deriving a persistence bound U_t(H) ≳ Σ_H purely from OPT-scale separation remains open. The special-case lemma addresses geometric separation but not the general case.\n\n### Next steps (actionable)\n1) Add the balanced-split corollary (with τ=⌊L/2⌋) and its proof (with safe constants) to output.md; note it as an optional third candidate in the min.\n2) Record the explicit-constants version of Corollary 8 for C_bi=C_fix=5 to support numerical corollaries and global aggregation.\n3) Write a short, fully rigorous proof of the special-case heavy-coverage lemma under metric separation (choose concrete constants, e.g., λ≥20 to make probabilities crisp), and add it as a separate lemma with an application corollary (O(ln(1/ε)) under oversampling of light part).\n4) Begin formalizing the random-k lower bound: fix a radii schedule {r_j}, prove Δ(k)=1 for ≥ 0.9k0 values in [k0,2k0), and compute the averaged Ω(log k0) lower bound via the miss-counting framework.\n5) Explore whether mild regularity assumptions on OPT(·) (e.g., lower bounds on plateau lengths at dyadic scales) can be derived from general geometric principles to yield unconditional O(log log k0) bounds via Corollary 8.\n"}
