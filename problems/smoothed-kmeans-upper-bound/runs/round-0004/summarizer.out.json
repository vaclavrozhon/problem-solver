  "summary_md": "This round produced several checkable refinements and concrete instantiations. Key technical additions: a new \u03c4 := \u230am/ln L\u230b branch that replaces the (m ln L)/L hybrid term by (m(1+ln ln L))/L (tightening intermediate regimes); a global per-plateau min-of-three envelope (pure-log, \u03c4=1 hybrid, \u03c4=\u230am/ln L\u230b); an optional balanced-split corollary (\u03c4=\u230aL/2\u230b) for midrange L; explicit numeric constants when C_bi=C_fix=5 (e.g., E[...] \u2264 35 + 10\u00b7min{ln^+(2m/(L\u22121)), (m ln L)/L} + 5\u00b7(ln m)/L); a concrete \u22651% probability instantiation; and progress on heavy-coverage: a pathwise bound H_t(H_cov) \u2264 5\u00b7\u2211OPT1 and conversion to conditional collision probabilities, plus a special-case metric-separation lemma (\u03bb\u226510) that gives high-probability coverage-before-collisions and O(ln(1/\u03b5)) final cost under oversampling. A lower-bound blueprint (heavy simplex + light singletons) aims to produce \u03a9(log k0) averaged lower bounds under random-k smoothing. Files used: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json.",
