Overview and audit of output.md
- The curated file now contains: (i) the per-k anchor bound (Theorem 1), (ii) per-plateau averaging (Theorem 2), (iii) the monotonicity lemma, (iv) a tunable τ-split (Theorem 3), (v) the hybrid extremes (Corollary 4), (vi) long-plateau constants (Corollary 5), (vii) a quantile-in-Δ lemma (Corollary 6), (viii) the min-of-extremes bound (Corollary 7), (ix) an upper envelope (Corollary 8), and (x) a plateau-level and globally mixed probability statement (Corollary 9). The remark “L ≤ m on [k0,2k0)” is present with the correct implication m/(L−1) ≥ 1.
- I see no correctness issues that require retraction. Constants are not yet fully optimized but are kept symbolic, which is fine for now.

New refinement: an improved “third branch” via choosing τ ≈ m/ln L
Why useful here. Corollary 8 gives the envelope K0 + K1·min{ ln^+(2m/(L−1)), (m ln L)/L } + K2·(ln m)/L. The (m ln L)/L term is sometimes loose. By an explicit choice τ := ⌊m/ln L⌋ in Theorem 3 (when admissible), we can replace (m ln L)/L by (m (1 + ln ln L))/L, which is strictly smaller for L≥e^e, tightening intermediate regimes.

Statement (proposed Corollary: τ = ⌊m/ln L⌋ branch).
- Setting τ* := min{ L−1, ⌊m/ln L⌋ } in Theorem 3, for L≥3 and m≥L, there exist absolute constants K0,K1,K2 (depending only on C_bi,C_fix) such that
  E_{k∈I} E_++[ALG_k/OPT_k]
  ≤ K0 + K1·(m/L)·(1 + ln ln L) + K2·(ln m)/L.
- In particular, when τ* = ⌊m/ln L⌋ ≤ L−1 (i.e., m ≤ (L−1) ln L), one can take
  E_{k∈I} E_++[ALG_k/OPT_k]
  ≤ 2 C_bi·[ 1 + (m/((L−1) ln L))·(a+1+ln(4 ln L)) + (m/(e(L−1)))·(1 + ln ln L) ] + (C_fix·(ln m + 2))/L,
  with a := 2 + 1/(2e).

Proof sketch (fully checkable from Theorem 3).
- Start from Theorem 3 with general τ. Put τ := ⌊m/ln L⌋. We use the following bounds for L≥3 and m≥L:
  1) τ ≥ m/ln L − 1 ⇒ 2m/τ ≤ 4 ln L ⇒ ln(2m/τ) ≤ ln(4 ln L).
  2) τ/(L−1) ≤ (m/ln L)/(L−1) ≤ m/(L ln L).
  3) H_{L−2} − H_{τ−1} ≤ ln((L−2)/(τ−1)) + 1 ≤ ln(L/τ) + 1 ≤ ln( (L ln L)/m ) + 1 ≤ 1 + ln ln L, since L ≤ m.
- Plugging into Theorem 3’s RHS:
  (τ/(L−1))(a + 1 + ln(2m/τ)) ≤ (m/(L ln L))(a+1+ln(4 ln L));
  ((L−1−τ)/(L−1)) ≤ 1;
  (m/(e(L−1)))(H_{L−2} − H_{τ−1}) ≤ (m/(e(L−1)))(1 + ln ln L).
- Add the Δ=0 endpoint term C_fix(ln m + O(1))/L. Absorb additive constants into K0 and account for L−1 ≈ L (since L≥3) to get the displayed form.
- If τ* = L−1 (i.e., m > (L−1) ln L), we revert to the pure-log branch in Corollary 4.

Consequences and regime comparison
- Min-of-three envelope. Taken together with Corollary 7, we can use a min of three branches: (i) pure-log: ln^+(2m/(L−1)), (ii) hybrid (τ=1): (m ln L)/L, (iii) the new τ=⌊m/ln L⌋: (m (1 + ln ln L))/L. This uniformly strengthens Corollary 8 by allowing the improved middle regime.
- Where it helps: When L is moderately large relative to m (e.g., L ≥ m^γ with γ∈(0,1)), both hybrid branches yield O(1). The improvement is most visible for intermediate L where the previous envelope gave O((m ln L)/L) but ln ln L ≪ ln L, so the new bound is smaller by a factor ≈ ln L / ln ln L.
- Checkable example. Let L = m/√ln m (so L ≤ m and L≥3 for m large). Then
  • Pure-log: ln(2m/(L−1)) ≈ ln(2√ln m) = O(ln ln m).
  • Old hybrid: (m ln L)/L ≈ (m ln(m/√ln m))/(m/√ln m) ≈ √ln m · (ln m − (1/2) ln ln m) = Θ(√ln m · ln m) [very loose].
  • New branch: (m (1 + ln ln L))/L ≈ √ln m · (1 + ln(ln m − (1/2) ln ln m)) = Θ(√ln m · ln ln m).
  Hence min{·} now picks the O(ln ln m) pure-log branch anyway, but the new branch dramatically tightens the hybrid alternative and will be advantageous in other intermediate regimes (e.g., L = m / polylog m).

Global aggregation (plateau-wise min-of-three)
- Using the decomposition of Corollary 3, we can strengthen Corollary 8 as follows. There exist absolute constants K0,K1,K2 such that for the covering plateaus I_j=[m_j,m_j+L_j),
  E_{k∼U([k0,2k0))} E_++[ALG_k/OPT_k]
  ≤ (1/k0) ∑_j L_j [ K0 + K1·min{ ln^+(2m_j/(L_j−1)), (m_j ln L_j)/L_j, (m_j (1 + ln ln L_j))/L_j } ]
    + (K2/k0) ∑_j ln m_j.
- This follows by taking, for each plateau, the minimum over the three explicit instantiations τ=L−1, τ=1, τ=⌊m_j/ln L_j⌋, and summing with weights L_j/k0.

Probability-≥0.01 guarantees (clarification)
- Corollary 9 provides the plateau-level and globally mixed guarantees via (η,c). A simple instantiation for “≥0.01 probability”: If a single plateau I occupies a γ≥0.02 fraction of [k0,2k0) and satisfies L ≥ α m, then choosing η=0.5 and c=2 gives
  P[ ALG_k/OPT_k ≤ 2·B_I ] ≥ γ·(0.5−O(1/L))·0.5 ≥ 0.01 for all sufficiently large L,
  with B_I ≤ 2·C_bi (1 + 1/(α e η)) + o(1). This is numerically loose but completely explicit. Tuning (η,c) can improve constants as desired.

Small technical lemmas and clarifications (ready-to-curate)
- Stirling floor correction in the τ=⌊m/ln L⌋ branch: Using τ ≥ m/ln L − 1 and m ≥ L ≥ 3, the inequality 2m/τ ≤ 4 ln L holds (since m/ln L ≥ L/ln L ≥ 3/ln 3 > 2, hence m/ln L − 1 ≥ (1/2)·m/ln L), justifying ln(2m/τ) ≤ ln(4 ln L) cleanly.
- Harmonic tail control: H_{L−2} − H_{τ−1} ≤ ln(L/τ) + 1 works uniformly for L≥3, τ≥1; with τ=⌊m/ln L⌋ and L ≤ m, this gives ≤ 1 + ln ln L.

Heavy-coverage program: a precise, checkable sub-lemma (pathwise bound)
- Pathwise covered-heavy control. For any set H of heavy optimal clusters, define eH_t(P) as in MRS. Then pathwise we have H_t(P) ≤ eH_t(P) ≤ 5·OPT1(P) for every heavy P and every t (the first inequality is by definition of eH, the second is Lemma 4.1 applied at first hit). Hence
  H_t(H_cov) ≤ 5·∑_{P∈H} OPT1(P) deterministically for all t.
- Conditional per-step collision probability bound. At step t conditioned on filtration F_t,
  P[“sample from a covered heavy cluster” | F_t] = H_t(H_cov) / cost_t(X)
  ≤ 5·(∑_{P∈H} OPT1(P)) / cost_t(X).
- This converts the heavy-collision question into lower bounding cost_t(X) (denominator) by a function of the current uncovered-heavy mass U_t(H) (plus possibly light mass). Under a quantitative “dominance/persistence” hypothesis of the form cost_t(X) ≥ β·U_t(H) for all t before heavy coverage completes (β≥1), we immediately get
  P[collision in heavy at step t | F_t] ≤ 5·(∑_H OPT1(P)) / (β·U_t(H)).
  Summing only over steps in which a heavy pick occurs and using U_t(H) ≥ ∑_{P∈H_uncovered} OPT1(P), we find that the expected number of heavy collisions before covering all heavy clusters is bounded by a telescoping potential argument akin to a variable-probability coupon collector. This is a concrete, checkable path: it remains to prove the β-persistence from a scale-separation condition (e.g., OPT_{k1} ≥ k^C·OPT_k) via the eH_t supermartingale and to carry out the summation rigorously (I will do this next).

Examples and sanity checks
- Dyadic plateau (one long plateau): L≈m. All three branches give O(1) (pure-log dominates), consistent with Corollary 5.
- Geometric intermediate L: If L = m / polylog m, then the pure-log branch gives O(log log m); the new τ=⌊m/ln L⌋ branch gives O( (m/L)·ln ln L ) = O( polylog(m)·ln ln m ), which is larger; hence the min will pick the pure-log branch, as desired.
- Short plateaus L=O(1): All hybrid branches devolve to O(m/L), while pure-log gives O(ln m). Min therefore selects O(ln m), matching known worst cases.

Gaps and open tasks (clearly identified)
- output.md currently presents the min-of-two envelope (Corollary 8). The improved τ=⌊m/ln L⌋ branch is not yet recorded; adding it would strengthen the per-plateau bound in some regimes.
- The heavy-coverage argument remains conditional. The pathwise bound H_t(H_cov) ≤ 5∑_H OPT1(P) is now explicit and correct. The key missing piece is to prove a denominator persistence bound cost_t(X) ≥ β·U_t(H) (or a comparable lower bound) from a scale-separation assumption; I will attempt this via the eH_t supermartingale and a careful analysis of how sampling outside H affects U_t(H).
- Lower bound under random-k smoothing: still open; designing an instance with many short plateaus across the entire window requires careful OPT(·) control. This remains an item for a separate development.

Concrete next steps (verifiable)
1) Curate the new τ=⌊m/ln L⌋ corollary into output.md (as a third explicit instantiation of Theorem 3) and add the “min-of-three” per-plateau envelope and its global aggregation counterpart. All inequalities are elementary and already itemized above.
2) Provide explicit numerical constants K0,K1,K2 when C_bi=C_fix=5 for the new branch, e.g., K0≈40, K1≈10, K2≈5 (to be checked and tightened in write-up).
3) For the probability-≥0.01 variant, add a short remark instantiating Corollary 9 with (η,c) tuned to hit 1% under a simple plateau mass condition (as outlined above), giving a concrete constant.
4) Heavy-coverage: formalize “β-persistence from scale separation” and sum conditional collision probabilities over heavy draws until coverage; aim for an explicit bound on expected heavy collisions (e.g., polynomially small in k under scale separation), then lift to high probability via Freedman–Azuma.
5) Explore, even empirically, OPT profiles where the new τ=⌊m/ln L⌋ branch strictly improves the previous envelope, to guide any further analytical tightening (e.g., replacing ln(4 ln L) by ln ln(2m) in some ranges).

### Quick audit of output.md (this round)
- The min-of-extremes bound (Corollary 7) and the derived upper envelope (Corollary 8) look correct and rigorously supported by Theorem 3 and H_q ≤ ln q + 1. The “plateau length within [k0,2k0)” Remark is now correctly stated with m/(L−1) ≥ 1.
- The probability corollary (Corollary 9) is also correct in its methodology (quantile-in-Δ + Markov). It cleanly separates the plateau-level and global mixing statements.
- Missing but useful: a rigorously stated “balanced-split” instantiation of Theorem 3 with τ=⌊L/2⌋ (with safe constants) that can improve constants in some intermediate regimes, and an explicit instantiation of constants in Corollary 8 when C_bi=C_fix=5 to facilitate downstream aggregation.

### New, checkable refinements (to be curated)

1) Balanced-split corollary with safe constants (intermediate regime)
- Statement (new). In the setting of Theorem 3 with L≥3 and τ:=⌊L/2⌋, for k uniform on I and ++ randomness,
  E[ALG/OPT] ≤ 2 C_bi [ (2/3)(a + 1 + ln(4m/(L−1))) + 1/2 + (m/(e(L−1)))(ln 3 + 1) ] + (C_fix(ln m + O(1)))/L,
  where a=2+1/(2e).
- Proof sketch (fully checkable): Start from Theorem 3, choose τ=⌊L/2⌋. Use the uniform bounds valid for all L≥3: τ/(L−1) ≤ 2/3; (L−1−τ)/(L−1) ≤ 1/2; H_{L−2}−H_{τ−1} ≤ ln 3 + 1; and ln(2m/τ) ≤ ln(4m/(L−1)). Substitute these into Theorem 3 and simplify. This yields a rigorous bound that can outperform both extremes in some midrange regimes (large L but not a fixed fraction of m), at the expense of slightly bigger constants on the logarithmic term.
- Why useful: Strengthens Corollary 7 by adding a third, explicitly computable candidate bound in the min, sometimes improving over the pure-log extreme when L is moderately large, and over the τ=1 extreme when m/(L−1) is not too big.

2) Explicit constants for the upper-envelope (Corollary 8) when C_bi=C_fix=5
- Claim (explicit instantiation). With C_bi=C_fix=5 and L≥2,
  E_{k∈I} E_++[ALG/OPT] ≤ 35 + 10·min{ ln^+(2m/(L−1)), (m ln L)/L } + 5·(ln m)/L.
- Justification: From Corollary 7, the logarithmic extreme gives 2·C_bi·(a+1) ≤ 2·5·(2+1/(2e)+1) ≤ 32 (more carefully: 10·(3+1/(2e)) ≈ 31.83), we round up to 35 to absorb O(1/L) terms and endpoint constants. The coefficient in front of ln^+(2m/(L−1)) is 2·C_bi=10. The hybrid extreme contributes a (m ln L)/(e(L−1)) term with factor 2·C_bi/e ≤ 10/e ≈ 3.68; we upper-envelope it by 10 for simplicity, safe since L−1≈L for L≥2. The endpoint Δ=0 term adds ≤ C_fix(ln m + 2)/L = 5(ln m + 2)/L, which we cover by 5·(ln m)/L after absorbing constants into the 35. This produces a fully explicit, conservative version of Corollary 8 ready for aggregation.
- Use: Facilitates clean global inequalities without carrying symbolic constants; helpful when deriving numeric probability thresholds from Corollary 9.

3) Plateau-level 1% guarantee: explicit instantiation
- From Corollary 9, choosing η=0.99 and c=100, on a single plateau I=[m,m+L) we get
  P_{k∼U(I),++}[ ALG/OPT ≤ 100·B_I ] ≥ (1−0.99−O(1/L))·0.99 ≈ 0.01 − O(1/L),
  with B_I = 2·C_bi·(1 + m/(e(T−1))) and T=⌈0.99(L−1)⌉+1. If L ≥ α m, then B_I ≤ 2·C_bi·(1 + 1/(α e · 0.99)) ≤ 10·(1 + 1.02/αe). For α=1 and C_bi=5, this gives B_I ≲ 10·(1+0.376) ≈ 13.76, hence ALG/OPT ≤ 1376 with probability ≥ 1% for k uniform on that plateau. If the plateau occupies a γ-fraction of [k0,2k0), the global (k,++) probability is ≥ γ times this quantity.
- Why useful: A ready-to-use “0.01-probability” bound with explicit constants under the simple condition L ≥ α m on one plateau covering a nonnegligible fraction γ of the window.

### Special-case heavy-coverage under metric separation (progress toward Subsec. 2)
- Motivation. The conjectural “heavy coverage” lemma under scale separation is difficult to prove in full generality due to possible reductions of U_t(H) by centers sampled outside heavy clusters. As an incremental step, we formalize and prove a special-case lemma under explicit metric separation, making the dominance/persistence condition verifiable.
- Setup. Let H be the set of k1 optimal clusters (heavy), and L the rest. For each heavy cluster P∈H, let diam2(P):=max_{x∈P}||x−µ_P||^2, and impose the separation condition: for some λ≥10,
  dist(µ_P, y) ≥ λ · sqrt(diam2(P)) for all P∈H and all y∉P.
  This enforces that points outside P are at least λ radii away from its centroid. Let k=k1+k2 and run k-means++ for k′=k1+(1+ε)k2 steps.
- Lemma (special-case heavy coverage). Under the above separation with λ≥10,
  (i) For any step t before covering all k1 heavy clusters, conditioned on the filtration, the probability that the next sample falls in an uncovered heavy cluster is at least 1 − O(1/λ^2).
  (ii) Consequently, with probability ≥ 1 − k1·O(1/λ^2), k-means++ selects one center in each heavy cluster within the first k1 selections that hit heavy clusters (i.e., before any heavy collision).
  (iii) Conditioned on (ii), the remaining k′−k1 steps oversample the light part by a factor (1+ε), hence by MRS Theorem 5.1, the final cost is ≤ 5·O(ln(1/ε))·OPT_k.
- Proof sketch (checkable constants): For (i), before covering P∈H, every x∈P has D(x)^2 ≥ ||x−µ_P||^2 (no heavy center chosen), while for any y∉P, D(y) ≥ dist(y,µ_P)−||x−µ_P|| ≥ (λ−1)·sqrt(diam2(P)) by triangle inequality. Summing over all uncovered heavy clusters and using that OPT1(P)=∑_{x∈P}||x−µ_P||^2, we get that the D^2-mass of uncovered heavy points is at least ∑_{P∈H_uncovered} OPT1(P), while the mass outside these heavy clusters is at most a 1/(λ−1)^2 fraction per point relative to diameters; aggregating, the uncovered-heavy mass dominates by a factor 1−O(1/λ^2). Thus the next D^2-sample lands in uncovered heavy with probability ≥ 1 − O(1/λ^2). Summing the collision probabilities over the k1 heavy hits yields (ii). Part (iii) follows from the bi-criteria bound (MRS Theorem 5.1). A short writeup can fix constants (e.g., replacing O(1/λ^2) by ≤ 5/λ^2) by carefully bounding the total outside mass in terms of ∑_{P∈H} OPT1(P).
- Why useful: Proves the desired phenomenon (coverage before collisions and O(ln(1/ε)) tail) in a clean geometric regime; provides a stepping stone toward deriving persistence from purely scale-separation conditions.

### Lower-bound direction: toward robustness under random-k smoothing
- Goal. Construct a dataset X for which Δ(k)=k−s(k)=1 for a 1−o(1) fraction of k∈[k0,2k0), implying that the plateau calculus cannot improve beyond Θ(log k0) unconditionally.
- Candidate blueprint (adapting MRS App. C.2):
  - Use one “heavy” simplex (many points) centered at the origin with extremely small edge length (so OPT1(heavy) ≈ 1 after scaling) and many “light” singleton clusters placed on coordinate axes at radii r_j chosen so that adding a center primarily “unlocks” one light cluster at a time with a small multiplicative drop in OPT.
  - Calibrate radii r_j so that OPT(k−1)/OPT(k)=1+Θ(1/ln k0) for most k in [k0,2k0), making the OPT sequence nearly flat and ensuring s(k)=k−1 typically.
- Next, compute E_{k,++}[ALG/OPT] over this window using Arthur–Vassilvitskii’s lower-bound technique (the “misses” process), to target a matching Ω(log k0) expectation.
- Concrete next steps: (i) write the exact OPT_k for this family; (ii) verify the discrete derivative control across the window; (iii) adapt the MRS miss-counting lower bound to average over k.

### Examples and sanity checks
- Long dyadic plateau: With OPT halving only once on [k0,2k0), L≈m. Using the explicit constants above, E_{k∈I}E_++[ALG/OPT] ≤ 35 + 10 ln 2 + o(1) ≈ 41.9.
- Intermediate L (balanced split advantage): Take L=m/√ln m. The balanced-split bound gives a term (m/(e(L−1)))(ln 3+1) ≈ O(√ln m), whereas the pure-log extreme gives 10 ln(2√ln m) = O(ln ln m). In this regime, the logarithmic extreme remains asymptotically better; the τ=⌊L/2⌋ bound, however, can numerically improve constants when m/(L−1) is small but L not a constant fraction of m.

### Obstacles and gaps
- Unconditional improvement: Without structural constraints on OPT(·), the plateau calculus still allows Θ(log k0) worst-case averages (e.g., when all L_j=1). No universal O(log log k0) upper bound is currently proven.
- Heavy-coverage beyond metric separation: Deriving a persistence bound U_t(H) ≳ Σ_H purely from OPT-scale separation remains open. The special-case lemma addresses geometric separation but not the general case.

### Next steps (actionable)
1) Add the balanced-split corollary (with τ=⌊L/2⌋) and its proof (with safe constants) to output.md; note it as an optional third candidate in the min.
2) Record the explicit-constants version of Corollary 8 for C_bi=C_fix=5 to support numerical corollaries and global aggregation.
3) Write a short, fully rigorous proof of the special-case heavy-coverage lemma under metric separation (choose concrete constants, e.g., λ≥20 to make probabilities crisp), and add it as a separate lemma with an application corollary (O(ln(1/ε)) under oversampling of light part).
4) Begin formalizing the random-k lower bound: fix a radii schedule {r_j}, prove Δ(k)=1 for ≥ 0.9k0 values in [k0,2k0), and compute the averaged Ω(log k0) lower bound via the miss-counting framework.
5) Explore whether mild regularity assumptions on OPT(·) (e.g., lower bounds on plateau lengths at dyadic scales) can be derived from general geometric principles to yield unconditional O(log log k0) bounds via Corollary 8.
