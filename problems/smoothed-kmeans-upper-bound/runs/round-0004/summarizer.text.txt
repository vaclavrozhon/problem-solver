  "summary_md": "This round produced several checkable refinements and concrete instantiations. Key technical additions: a new τ := ⌊m/ln L⌋ branch that replaces the (m ln L)/L hybrid term by (m(1+ln ln L))/L (tightening intermediate regimes); a global per-plateau min-of-three envelope (pure-log, τ=1 hybrid, τ=⌊m/ln L⌋); an optional balanced-split corollary (τ=⌊L/2⌋) for midrange L; explicit numeric constants when C_bi=C_fix=5 (e.g., E[...] ≤ 35 + 10·min{ln^+(2m/(L−1)), (m ln L)/L} + 5·(ln m)/L); a concrete ≥1% probability instantiation; and progress on heavy-coverage: a pathwise bound H_t(H_cov) ≤ 5·∑OPT1 and conversion to conditional collision probabilities, plus a special-case metric-separation lemma (λ≥10) that gives high-probability coverage-before-collisions and O(ln(1/ε)) final cost under oversampling. A lower-bound blueprint (heavy simplex + light singletons) aims to produce Ω(log k0) averaged lower bounds under random-k smoothing. Files used: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json.",
