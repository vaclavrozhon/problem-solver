High-level assessment. Both reports build on the already sound plateau calculus. I checked the proposed additions against Theorem 3 and standard inequalities. There are two clearly rigorous, valuable per-plateau refinements we can safely curate: (i) the τ≈m/ln L branch (Prover 01), and (ii) an explicit constants instantiation for C_bi=C_fix=5 (Prover 02). I do not see a correctness issue in our current output.md, and the symbolic-constant presentation remains appropriate.

On Prover 01’s τ≈m/ln L branch. The choice τ*:=min{L−1, ⌊m/ln L⌋} is admissible in Theorem 3. In the interesting subcase m ≤ (L−1) ln L (so τ*=⌊m/ln L⌋), for L≥3 and m≥L (the latter holds for plateaus contained in [k0,2k0) by our existing Remark), the elementary bounds used are correct: τ≥m/ln L − 1 implies 2m/τ ≤ 4 ln L, hence ln(2m/τ) ≤ ln(4 ln L); τ/(L−1) ≤ m/((L−1) ln L); and H_{L−2} − H_{τ−1} ≤ ln(L/τ)+1 ≤ 1 + ln ln L. Plugging these into Theorem 3 yields an explicit upper bound whose dominant m,L dependence is (m/L)·(1+ln ln L), strictly improving the earlier (m ln L)/L term. In the complementary subcase m > (L−1) ln L, τ*=L−1 recovers the pure-log branch. This is ready to curate as a corollary and to update the envelope to a “min-of-three.”

On Prover 02’s balanced split and explicit constants. The τ=⌊L/2⌋ instantiation is also a correct, self-contained refinement with safe constants: τ/(L−1)≤2/3, (L−1−τ)/(L−1)≤1/2, ln(2m/τ)≤ln(4m/(L−1)), and H_{L−2}−H_{τ−1}≤ln 3+1 for all L≥3. While useful, we already recorded this template in notes; to keep output.md lean, I propose we defer formalizing it unless we find regimes where it beats both extremes and the new τ≈m/ln L branch. The explicit-constants envelope for C_bi=C_fix=5 is easy to state rigorously; I recommend curating it, and simultaneously extending it to the min-of-three by keeping the same conservative coefficients.

Probabilistic instantiations. The methodology in Corollary 9 is correct. However, the example “η=0.99, c=100 gives ≥0.01−O(1/L)” is slightly optimistic: (1−η)(1−1/c)=0.01×0.99=0.0099. To guarantee ≥1% cleanly, e.g., take η=0.98 and c=2, yielding (1−η)(1−1/c)=0.02×0.5=1% (up to O(1/L)). I will add a corrected numerical remark.

Heavy-coverage. Prover 01’s pathwise inequality H_t(H_cov)≤eH_t(H_cov)≤5∑_H OPT1(P) is plausible, but the justification “Lemma 4.1 at first hit” needs careful citation and definitions (what exactly is eH_t?). Prover 02’s metric-separation lemma sketch is suggestive but not yet rigorous: the lower bound D(y)≥(λ−1)·sqrt(diam2(P)) for y outside P does not hold unconditionally because y may lie close to a previously chosen center outside H. Neither heavy-coverage item is ready for output.md. They can remain in notes with caveats.

Next steps for provers.
- Tighten the τ≈m/ln L branch: (a) isolate small-L cases (L=2) and state the branch for L≥3; (b) give a clean version of the global min-of-three aggregation (plateau-wise, then window-wise) and, optionally, provide explicit constants when C_bi=C_fix=5.
- If we choose to include the balanced split, add it as a corollary and compare numerically against the min-of-three to identify regimes where it is preferred.
- Probabilistic corollary: add a short remark with a parameter choice that truly yields ≥1% without asymptotic wiggle room.
- Heavy coverage: formalize eH_t, state any use of supermartingale properties precisely, and derive a correct denominator lower bound cost_t(X)≥β·U_t(H) under a verifiable hypothesis before any collision summation.
- Lower bound: proceed with a concrete instance and compute OPT_k exactly across the window, then adapt Arthur–Vassilvitskii’s “misses” argument to the k-averaged setting.
