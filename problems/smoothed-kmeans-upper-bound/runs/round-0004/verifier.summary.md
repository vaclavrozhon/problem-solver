High-level assessment. Both reports build on the already sound plateau calculus. I checked the proposed additions against Theorem 3 and standard inequalities. There are two clearly rigorous, valuable per-plateau refinements we can safely curate: (i) the τ≈m/ln L branch (Prover 01), and (ii) an explicit constants instantiation for C_bi=C_fix=5 (Prover 02). I do not see a correctness issue in our current output.md, and the symbolic-constant presentation remains appropriate.
