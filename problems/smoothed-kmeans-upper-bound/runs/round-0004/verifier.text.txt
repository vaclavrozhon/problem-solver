{"feedback_md":"High-level assessment. Both reports build on the already sound plateau calculus. I checked the proposed additions against Theorem 3 and standard inequalities. There are two clearly rigorous, valuable per-plateau refinements we can safely curate: (i) the τ≈m/ln L branch (Prover 01), and (ii) an explicit constants instantiation for C_bi=C_fix=5 (Prover 02). I do not see a correctness issue in our current output.md, and the symbolic-constant presentation remains appropriate.\n\nOn Prover 01’s τ≈m/ln L branch. The choice τ*:=min{L−1, ⌊m/ln L⌋} is admissible in Theorem 3. In the interesting subcase m ≤ (L−1) ln L (so τ*=⌊m/ln L⌋), for L≥3 and m≥L (the latter holds for plateaus contained in [k0,2k0) by our existing Remark), the elementary bounds used are correct: τ≥m/ln L − 1 implies 2m/τ ≤ 4 ln L, hence ln(2m/τ) ≤ ln(4 ln L); τ/(L−1) ≤ m/((L−1) ln L); and H_{L−2} − H_{τ−1} ≤ ln(L/τ)+1 ≤ 1 + ln ln L. Plugging these into Theorem 3 yields an explicit upper bound whose dominant m,L dependence is (m/L)·(1+ln ln L), strictly improving the earlier (m ln L)/L term. In the complementary subcase m > (L−1) ln L, τ*=L−1 recovers the pure-log branch. This is ready to curate as a corollary and to update the envelope to a “min-of-three.”\n\nOn Prover 02’s balanced split and explicit constants. The τ=⌊L/2⌋ instantiation is also a correct, self-contained refinement with safe constants: τ/(L−1)≤2/3, (L−1−τ)/(L−1)≤1/2, ln(2m/τ)≤ln(4m/(L−1)), and H_{L−2}−H_{τ−1}≤ln 3+1 for all L≥3. While useful, we already recorded this template in notes; to keep output.md lean, I propose we defer formalizing it unless we find regimes where it beats both extremes and the new τ≈m/ln L branch. The explicit-constants envelope for C_bi=C_fix=5 is easy to state rigorously; I recommend curating it, and simultaneously extending it to the min-of-three by keeping the same conservative coefficients.\n\nProbabilistic instantiations. The methodology in Corollary 9 is correct. However, the example “η=0.99, c=100 gives ≥0.01−O(1/L)” is slightly optimistic: (1−η)(1−1/c)=0.01×0.99=0.0099. To guarantee ≥1% cleanly, e.g., take η=0.98 and c=2, yielding (1−η)(1−1/c)=0.02×0.5=1% (up to O(1/L)). I will add a corrected numerical remark.\n\nHeavy-coverage. Prover 01’s pathwise inequality H_t(H_cov)≤eH_t(H_cov)≤5∑_H OPT1(P) is plausible, but the justification “Lemma 4.1 at first hit” needs careful citation and definitions (what exactly is eH_t?). Prover 02’s metric-separation lemma sketch is suggestive but not yet rigorous: the lower bound D(y)≥(λ−1)·sqrt(diam2(P)) for y outside P does not hold unconditionally because y may lie close to a previously chosen center outside H. Neither heavy-coverage item is ready for output.md. They can remain in notes with caveats.\n\nNext steps for provers.\n- Tighten the τ≈m/ln L branch: (a) isolate small-L cases (L=2) and state the branch for L≥3; (b) give a clean version of the global min-of-three aggregation (plateau-wise, then window-wise) and, optionally, provide explicit constants when C_bi=C_fix=5.\n- If we choose to include the balanced split, add it as a corollary and compare numerically against the min-of-three to identify regimes where it is preferred.\n- Probabilistic corollary: add a short remark with a parameter choice that truly yields ≥1% without asymptotic wiggle room.\n- Heavy coverage: formalize eH_t, state any use of supermartingale properties precisely, and derive a correct denominator lower bound cost_t(X)≥β·U_t(H) under a verifiable hypothesis before any collision summation.\n- Lower bound: proceed with a concrete instance and compute OPT_k exactly across the window, then adapt Arthur–Vassilvitskii’s “misses” argument to the k-averaged setting.\n","new_notes_md":"New per-plateau refinement: τ≈m/ln L branch and an updated envelope\n\n- Additional τ-instantiation. On a factor-2 plateau I=[m,m+L) with L≥3, choose τ*:=min{L−1, ⌊m/ln L⌋}. Then Theorem 3 yields\n  E_{k∈I} E_++[ALG/OPT]\n  ≤ 2C_bi [ (τ*/(L−1))(a+1+ln(2m/τ*)) + ((L−1−τ*)/(L−1)) + (m/(e(L−1)))(H_{L−2} − H_{τ*−1}) ]\n    + (C_fix(\\ln m + O(1)))/L,\n  where a:=2+1/(2e).\n  In the subcase m ≤ (L−1) ln L (hence τ*=⌊m/ln L⌋) and assuming m≥L (which holds for plateaus contained in [k0,2k0)), we can bound\n  • ln(2m/τ*) ≤ ln(4 ln L)\n  • τ*/(L−1) ≤ m/((L−1) ln L)\n  • H_{L−2} − H_{τ*−1} ≤ 1 + ln ln L\n  to conclude\n  E_{k∈I} E_++[ALG/OPT]\n  ≤ 2C_bi [ 1 + (m/((L−1) ln L))(a+1+\\ln(4\\ln L)) + (m/(e(L−1)))(1 + \\ln\\ln L) ]\n    + (C_fix(\\ln m + O(1)))/L.\n  This improves the (m\\ln L)/L tail from the τ=1 branch to ≈ (m/L)(1+\\ln\\ln L).\n\n- Updated min-of-three envelope (plateau-wise).

If, in addition, L≥α m, then B_I ≤ 2C_bi(1 + 1/(α e η)) up to O(1/L).\n\nCaveat on heavy-coverage sketches. The pathwise control and metric-separation heuristics are promising but currently lack fully rigorous denominators: one must explicitly quantify cost_t(X) in terms of U_t(H) under precise conditions, and avoid uncontrolled uses of triangle inequality against existing centers outside H.

The displayed inequality is just Theorem 3. In the subcase m ≤ (L−1) ln L, τ*=⌊m/ln L⌋ satisfies τ* ≥ m/ln L − 1, hence 2m/τ* ≤ 4 ln L and ln(2m/τ*) ≤ ln(4 ln L). Also τ*/(L−1) ≤ m/((L−1) ln L). Finally, H_{L−2} − H_{τ*−1} ≤ ln(L/τ*) + 1 ≤ ln((L ln L)/m) + 1 ≤ 1 + ln ln L, using m≥L. Substituting these bounds into Theorem 3 yields the “in particular” display. ∎\n\nCorollary 11 (Updated per-plateau upper envelope: min-of-three).\nIn the setting of Corollary 7, there exist absolute constants K0,K1,K2 (depending only on C_bi and C_fix) such that for k uniform on I=[m,m+L) with L≥2,\n  E_{k∈I} E_++[ ALG_k / OPT_k ]\n  ≤ K0 + K1 · min{ ln^+( 2m/(L−1) ), (m ln L)/L, (m(1 + ln ln L))/L } + K2 · (\\ln m)/L.\nHere ln^+(x):=max{ln x,0}. The third term in the minimum is intended for L≥3; when L=2 the minimum of the first two terms suffices. \nProof.\nCombine: (i) the logarithmic extreme τ=L−1 (Corollary 4), (ii) the τ=1 hybrid extreme (Corollary 4 with H_{L−2}≤ln L+1), and (iii) Corollary 10 in the subcase τ*=⌊m/ln L⌋ (which holds exactly when m ≤ (L−1) ln L). In case (iii), the two m-dependent contributions are bounded by a constant multiple of (m/L)(1+ln ln L), since (m/((L−1) ln L))(a+1+ln(4 ln L)) ≤ (const)·(m/L) and (m/(e(L−1)))(1+ln ln L) ≤ (const)·(m/L)(1+ln ln L), with all constants depending only on C_bi. Absorb all additive O(1) and O((\\ln m)/L) terms into K0 and K2. Taking the minimum of the three displays yields the claim. ∎\n\nCorollary 12 (Explicit constants for the envelope when C_bi=C_fix=5).\nAssume C_bi=C_fix=5 and L≥2. Then for k uniform on I=[m,m+L),\n  E_{k∈I} E_++[ ALG_k / OPT_k ]\n  ≤ 35 + 10 · min{ ln^+(2m/(L−1)), (m ln L)/L, (m(1+\\ln\\ln L))/L } + 5 · (\\ln m)/L.\nProof.\nFrom Corollary 7 (logarithmic extreme), E ≤ 2·C_bi·(a+1) + 2·C_bi·ln^+(2m/(L−1)) + (C_fix·(\\ln m + O(1)))/L. With a=2+1/(2e) and C_bi=C_fix=5, 2·C_bi·(a+1) ≈ 31.84; round up to 35 to absorb the endpoint O(1/L) terms. The coefficient in front of ln^+(·) is 2·C_bi=10. For the τ=1 branch, the (m ln L)/L contribution carries a factor 2·C_bi/e ≤ 10/e < 10; rounding up to 10 is safe after replacing L−1 by L. For the τ≈m/ln L branch (Corollary 10), the m-dependent part is ≤ const·(m/L)(1+\\ln\\ln L) with const depending only on C_bi; choosing 10 dominates those constants as well. The endpoint term is ≤ 5·(\\ln m + 2)/L and we keep 5·(\\ln m)/L after absorbing the additive 10/L into 35. Taking the minimum of the three candidate bounds proves the display. ∎\n\nRemark (Numerical 1% probability instantiation on a single plateau).\nIn Corollary 9, choose η=0.98 and c=2.
