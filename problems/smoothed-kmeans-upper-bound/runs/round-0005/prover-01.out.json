The \u201c\u22651% probability\u201d remark now uses \u03b7=0.98, c=2, which cleanly gives 1% mass up to O(1/L).\n- Minor gap to clarify: Corollary 11 explicitly restricts the third branch (m(1+ln ln L))/L to L\u22653. Corollary 12 states a min-of-three for L\u22652 without this restriction. For L=2, ln ln L<0, so the third term can be negative and should not be part of the minimum. Suggested fix: add \u201cthe third term is intended only for L\u22653; for L=2 take the minimum of the first two terms,\u201d mirroring Cor. 11.\n\nNew, checkable additions recommended for output.md\n\n1) Global min-of-three aggregation across plateaus (explicit statement)\n- Statement (Global envelope). Let [k0,2k0) be partitioned into maximal factor-2 plateaus I_j=[m_j,m_j+L_j), j=1,\u2026,J. Then for k uniform in [k0,2k0) and k-means++ randomness,\n  E_{k,++}[ALG_k/OPT_k]\n  \u2264 (1/k0) \u03a3_{j: L_j\u22652} L_j [ K0 + K1\u00b7min{ ln^+(2m_j/(L_j\u22121)), (m_j ln L_j)/L_j, (m_j(1+ln ln L_j))/L_j } ]\n    + (K2/k0) \u03a3_{j: L_j\u22652} ln m_j + (1/k0) \u03a3_{j: L_j=1} C_fix(ln m_j + O(1)).\n  For C_bi=C_fix=5, one can set K0=35, K1=10, K2=5 (as in Corollary 12). For the third term in the minimum, restrict to L_j\u22653.\n- Why useful: This directly operationalizes Corollaries 11\u201312 into a window-level bound and makes the tradeoffs transparent. Proof: average Cor. 11 over each plateau with weight L_j/k0, add the \u0394=0 endpoint contributions (as in Cor. 3), and handle L_j=1 via the fixed\u2011k bound.\n\n2) A simple bound on the endpoint-sum contribution (unweighted log term)\n- Lemma (Endpoint term cap). With notation above, (1/k0) \u03a3_{j: L_j\u22652} ln m_j \u2264 ln(2k0).\n  Proof: There are at most J\u2264k0 plateaus and each m_j\u22642k0\u22121, so \u03a3 ln m_j \u2264 J\u00b7ln(2k0) \u2264 k0\u00b7ln(2k0). Dividing by k0 yields the claim. Consequence: the unweighted endpoint term is never more than O(ln k0), matching the worst-case \u0398(ln k0) behavior already noted.\n\n3) Long-plateau constant regime \u2014 global instantiation with explicit constants\n- Corollary (Global constant under a single long plateau). Suppose there exists a plateau I=[m,m+L) with L\u2265\u03b1 m and L/k0\u2265\u03b3. Then using Corollary 5 with C_bi=5 and any L\u22653,\n  E_{k\u2208I,++}[ALG/OPT] \u2264 10\u00b7(3 + 1/(2e) + ln(2/\u03b1)) + o(1) (as L\u2192\u221e).\n  Therefore,\n  E_{k,++}[ALG/OPT] \u2264 \u03b3\u00b7O_\u03b1(1) + (1\u2212\u03b3)\u00b7[the global min-of-three bound on [k0,2k0)\\I].\n- This is an immediate corollary of Cor. 5 and the global averaging in Item 1.\n\n4) 1%-probability guarantee \u2014 explicit global mixing\n- Corollary (\u22651% mass under a long plateau). Under the same assumptions as above (L\u2265\u03b1 m, L/k0\u2265\u03b3), Corollary 9 with \u03b7=0.98 and c=2 and the Remark after Corollary 12 give\n  P_{k\u223cU([k0,2k0)),++}[ ALG/OPT \u2264 2\u00b7B_I ] \u2265 \u03b3\u00b7(1\u2212\u03b7\u2212O(1/L))\u00b7(1\u22121/2) \u2265 0.01\u00b7\u03b3 \u2212 O(\u03b3/L),\n  with B_I = 2\u00b7C_bi\u00b7(1 + 1/(\u03b1 e \u03b7)) + o(1). For C_bi=5 and \u03b1=1 this yields ALG/OPT \u2264 ~20\u00b7(1 + 1/(0.98 e)) \u2248 27.7 on at least 1%\u00b7\u03b3 of the joint (k,++) mass. This directly instantiates the alternative task objective under a simple, checkable condition.\n\nExamples and sanity checks\n- Power-law OPT: OPT_k \u221d k^{\u2212p} with p>0. Over [k0,2k0), a single factor\u20112 drop occurs, so plateau lengths satisfy L \u2248 (2^{1/p}\u22121)m = \u0398(m), i.e., \u03b1=\u0398_p(1). Global average is O_p(1) by Item 1.\n- Worst-case short plateaus: If L_j=1 for J\u2248k0 plateaus, Item 2 shows the endpoint term alone is \u0398(ln k0), so no unconditional improvement over \u0398(ln k0) is possible via plateau calculus.\n\nObstacles and open tasks\n- Constants for small L: For L=2, ensure the third branch is excluded in Corollary 12 (as already noted for Corollary 11). This avoids negative values from ln ln 2 in the minimum.\n- Heavy-coverage program: The metric-separation special case remains promising, but a fully general scale-separation-to-persistence derivation is open. Next concrete step: quantify a denominator lower bound cost_t(X) \u2265 \u03b2\u00b7U_t(H) under explicit geometric or separation assumptions, then sum conditional collision probabilities rigorously.\n\nNext steps (concrete and verifiable)\n1) Add the global min-of-three aggregation statement (Item 1) to output.md with the explicit constants option for C_bi=C_fix=5; include the L\u22653 restriction for the third branch in both Corollaries 11 and 12.\n2) Add the endpoint-sum cap lemma (Item 2) as a remark to bound the contribution of \u0394=0 endpoints globally by \u2264 ln(2k0)\u00b7K2.\n3) Include the long-plateau global corollary and the 1%-probability global instantiation (Items 3\u20134), which follow immediately from existing corollaries.\n4) Heavy-coverage: attempt a formal bound of the form E[U_{t+1}(H) | F_t, sample outside H] \u2265 (1\u2212\u03b5/R)\u00b7U_t(H) under a scale separation R\u2265k^C plus a mild geometric regularity, then proceed to an expected-collisions bound via conditional probability summation.\n\nWhy these are incremental and auditable\n- All additions are direct aggregations or instantiations of existing per-plateau results, with short proofs and explicit constants.\n- The minor fix in Corollary 12 (L\u22653 restriction for the third term) is precise and prevents a small edge-case pitfall.\n- The probability corollary provides a clean \u22651% guarantee meeting the alternative task statement under transparent conditions.\n"
