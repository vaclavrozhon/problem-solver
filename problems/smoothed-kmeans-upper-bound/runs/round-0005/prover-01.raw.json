The “≥1% probability” remark now uses η=0.98, c=2, which cleanly gives 1% mass up to O(1/L).\\n- Minor gap to clarify: Corollary 11 explicitly restricts the third branch (m(1+ln ln L))/L to L≥3. Corollary 12 states a min-of-three for L≥2 without this restriction. For L=2, ln ln L<0, so the third term can be negative and should not be part of the minimum. Suggested fix: add “the third term is intended only for L≥3; for L=2 take the minimum of the first two terms,” mirroring Cor. 11.\\n\\nNew, checkable additions recommended for output.md\\n\\n1) Global min-of-three aggregation across plateaus (explicit statement)\\n- Statement (Global envelope). Let [k0,2k0) be partitioned into maximal factor-2 plateaus I_j=[m_j,m_j+L_j), j=1,…,J. Then for k uniform in [k0,2k0) and k-means++ randomness,\\n  E_{k,++}[ALG_k/OPT_k]\\n  ≤ (1/k0) Σ_{j: L_j≥2} L_j [ K0 + K1·min{ ln^+(2m_j/(L_j−1)), (m_j ln L_j)/L_j, (m_j(1+ln ln L_j))/L_j } ]\\n    + (K2/k0) Σ_{j: L_j≥2} ln m_j + (1/k0) Σ_{j: L_j=1} C_fix(ln m_j + O(1)).\\n  For C_bi=C_fix=5, one can set K0=35, K1=10, K2=5 (as in Corollary 12). For the third term in the minimum, restrict to L_j≥3.\\n- Why useful: This directly operationalizes Corollaries 11–12 into a window-level bound and makes the tradeoffs transparent. Proof: average Cor. 11 over each plateau with weight L_j/k0, add the Δ=0 endpoint contributions (as in Cor. 3), and handle L_j=1 via the fixed‑k bound.\\n\\n2) A simple bound on the endpoint-sum contribution (unweighted log term)\\n- Lemma (Endpoint term cap). With notation above, (1/k0) Σ_{j: L_j≥2} ln m_j ≤ ln(2k0).\\n  Proof: There are at most J≤k0 plateaus and each m_j≤2k0−1, so Σ ln m_j ≤ J·ln(2k0) ≤ k0·ln(2k0). Dividing by k0 yields the claim. Consequence: the unweighted endpoint term is never more than O(ln k0), matching the worst-case Θ(ln k0) behavior already noted.\\n\\n3) Long-plateau constant regime — global instantiation with explicit constants\\n- Corollary (Global constant under a single long plateau). Suppose there exists a plateau I=[m,m+L) with L≥α m and L/k0≥γ. Then using Corollary 5 with C_bi=5 and any L≥3,\\n  E_{k∈I,++}[ALG/OPT] ≤ 10·(3 + 1/(2e) + ln(2/α)) + o(1) (as L→∞).\\n  Therefore,\\n  E_{k,++}[ALG/OPT] ≤ γ·O_α(1) + (1−γ)·[the global min-of-three bound on [k0,2k0)\\\\I].\\n- This is an immediate corollary of Cor. 5 and the global averaging in Item 1.\\n\\n4) 1%-probability guarantee — explicit global mixing\\n- Corollary (≥1% mass under a long plateau). Under the same assumptions as above (L≥α m, L/k0≥γ), Corollary 9 with η=0.98 and c=2 and the Remark after Corollary 12 give\\n  P_{k∼U([k0,2k0)),++}[ ALG/OPT ≤ 2·B_I ] ≥ γ·(1−η−O(1/L))·(1−1/2) ≥ 0.01·γ − O(γ/L),\\n  with B_I = 2·C_bi·(1 + 1/(α e η)) + o(1). For C_bi=5 and α=1 this yields ALG/OPT ≤ ~20·(1 + 1/(0.98 e)) ≈ 27.7 on at least 1%·γ of the joint (k,++) mass. This directly instantiates the alternative task objective under a simple, checkable condition.\\n\\nExamples and sanity checks\\n- Power-law OPT: OPT_k ∝ k^{−p} with p>0. Over [k0,2k0), a single factor‑2 drop occurs, so plateau lengths satisfy L ≈ (2^{1/p}−1)m = Θ(m), i.e., α=Θ_p(1). Global average is O_p(1) by Item 1.\\n- Worst-case short plateaus: If L_j=1 for J≈k0 plateaus, Item 2 shows the endpoint term alone is Θ(ln k0), so no unconditional improvement over Θ(ln k0) is possible via plateau calculus.\\n\\nObstacles and open tasks\\n- Constants for small L: For L=2, ensure the third branch is excluded in Corollary 12 (as already noted for Corollary 11). This avoids negative values from ln ln 2 in the minimum.\\n- Heavy-coverage program: The metric-separation special case remains promising, but a fully general scale-separation-to-persistence derivation is open. Next concrete step: quantify a denominator lower bound cost_t(X) ≥ β·U_t(H) under explicit geometric or separation assumptions, then sum conditional collision probabilities rigorously.\\n\\nNext steps (concrete and verifiable)\\n1) Add the global min-of-three aggregation statement (Item 1) to output.md with the explicit constants option for C_bi=C_fix=5; include the L≥3 restriction for the third branch in both Corollaries 11 and 12.\\n2) Add the endpoint-sum cap lemma (Item 2) as a remark to bound the contribution of Δ=0 endpoints globally by ≤ ln(2k0)·K2.\\n3) Include the long-plateau global corollary and the 1%-probability global instantiation (Items 3–4), which follow immediately from existing corollaries.\\n4) Heavy-coverage: attempt a formal bound of the form E[U_{t+1}(H) | F_t, sample outside H] ≥ (1−ε/R)·U_t(H) under a scale separation R≥k^C plus a mild geometric regularity, then proceed to an expected-collisions bound via conditional probability summation.\\n\\nWhy these are incremental and auditable\\n- All additions are direct aggregations or instantiations of existing per-plateau results, with short proofs and explicit constants.\\n- The minor fix in Corollary 12 (L≥3 restriction for the third term) is precise and prevents a small edge-case pitfall.\\n- The probability corollary provides a clean ≥1% guarantee meeting the alternative task statement under transparent conditions.\\n\"}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"auto","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"ProverOutput","schema_":{"properties":{"progress_md":{"description":"Append-only progress notes","title":"Progress Md","type":"string"}},"required":["progress_md"],"title":"ProverOutput","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":76756,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":5198,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":3456},"total_tokens":81954},"user":null,"store":true}
