  "progress_md": "## Quick audit of output.md (this round)\n- The new \u03c4\u2248m/ln L branch (Corollary 10) is stated correctly with L\u22653 and uses the previously recorded remark L\u2264m on [k0,2k0). The inequalities \u03c4\u2265m/ln L\u22121 \u21d2 ln(2m/\u03c4)\u2264ln(4 ln L), \u03c4/(L\u22121)\u2264m/((L\u22121) ln L), and H_{L\u22122}\u2212H_{\u03c4\u22121}\u22641+ln ln L are valid and inserted properly.\n- The min-of-three envelope (Corollary 11) logically follows by taking the minimum of the three explicit instantiations and absorbing additive terms. The explicit-constant version for C_bi=C_fix=5 (Corollary 12) is conservative and sound. A minor constant improvement is possible (see below), but not necessary for asymptotics.\n- The probability remark now uses \u03b7=0.98 and c=2 to ensure an unconditional \u22651% mass (up to O(1/L)), which fixes the earlier 0.0099 issue.\n\nI found no correctness errors; the presentation is coherent and self-contained for the plateau calculus.\n\n## New, checkable contributions\n\n### Lemma 1 (Global worst-case aggregation recovers O(log k0))\nStatement. Let [k0,2k0) be partitioned into maximal factor-2 plateaus I_j=[m_j,m_j+L_j) with \u2211_j L_j=k0. Using the pure-log branch from Corollary 7 (and the fixed-k bound for L_j=1), we have the unconditional bound\nE_{k\u223cU([k0,2k0)),++}[ALG_k/OPT_k] \u2264 K\u2032 + K\u2033\u00b7ln(2k0),\nfor absolute constants K\u2032,K\u2033 depending only on C_bi,C_fix.\nWhy useful. This shows our framework unconditionally matches the \u0398(log k0) baseline, validating that improvements necessarily require structural information on plateaus.\nSketch proof (fully checkable). For L_j\u22652,\n(1/k0)\u00b7L_j\u00b7ln^+(2m_j/(L_j\u22121)) \u2264 (1/k0)\u00b7L_j(ln 2 + ln m_j) \u2212 (1/k0)\u00b7L_j\u00b7ln(L_j\u22121).\nSumming over j and using L_j\u22121\u22651 so the last term is \u22640, we get\n(1/k0)\u2211_{j:L_j\u22652} L_j ln^+(2m_j/(L_j\u22121)) \u2264 ln 2 + (1/k0)\u2211_{j:L_j\u22652} L_j ln m_j.\nNow, for every k\u2208I_j, m_j\u2264k, hence ln m_j \u2264 ln k. Therefore,\n(1/k0)\u2211_{j:L_j\u22652} L_j ln m_j \u2264 (1/k0)\u2211_{k=k0}^{2k0\u22121} ln k \u2264 ln(2k0) \u2212 1 + o(1).\nAdd the endpoint terms (1/k0)\u2211_{j:L_j\u22652} A2 ln m_j \u2264 A2 ln(2k0) and the L_j=1 contribution (bounded by C_fix(ln(2k0)+O(1)) per index). Multiplying by the fixed absolute coefficients from Corollaries 2 and 7 and absorbing constants yields the displayed K\u2032+K\u2033 ln(2k0) bound.\n\n### Corollary 1 (Mixture bound with a long-plateau mass)\nStatement. Suppose the set J_long of plateaus satisfying L_j \u2265 \u03b1 m_j covers a \u03b3-fraction of [k0,2k0), i.e., \u2211_{j\u2208J_long} L_j \u2265 \u03b3 k0, where \u03b1,\u03b3\u2208(0,1]. Then\nE_{k}[ALG/OPT] \u2264 \u03b3\u00b7B_long(\u03b1) + (1\u2212\u03b3)\u00b7(K\u2032 + K\u2033\u00b7ln(2k0)) + O((1/k0)\u2211_j ln m_j),\nwith B_long(\u03b1) = 2\u00b7C_bi\u00b7(a+1+ln(2/\u03b1)) (cf. Corollary 5) and absolute K\u2032,K\u2033 from Lemma 1.\nWhy useful. This gives a clean, global interpolation: any nontrivial mass \u03b3 of long plateaus pushes the average below the \u0398(log k0) worst case by an additive \u03b3\u00b7O(1), with explicit constants.\nProof sketch. Average Corollary 5 over j\u2208J_long with weights L_j/k0 (giving \u2264\u03b3\u00b7B_long(\u03b1)+o(1)), and use Lemma 1 on the complement. The endpoint O((ln m_j)/L_j) terms aggregate into O((1/k0)\u2211_j ln m_j) \u2264 O(ln(2k0)).\n\n### Corollary 2 (Global \u22651% probability guarantee under a single long plateau)\nStatement. If some plateau I=[m,m+L) satisfies L \u2265 \u03b1 m and covers a \u03b3-fraction of [k0,2k0), then for k uniform on [k0,2k0) and ++ randomness,\nP[ ALG_k/OPT_k \u2264 2\u00b7B_I ] \u2265 \u03b3\u00b7(0.5\u2212O(1/L))\u00b70.5 \u2265 0.01\u2212o(1)\nfor parameters \u03b7=0.98, c=2 in Corollary 9, with B_I=2\u00b7C_bi\u00b7(1 + 1/(\u03b1 e \u03b7)) + O(1/L).\nWhy useful. This is a global, fully explicit \u22651% probability guarantee under a single structural condition on OPT(\u00b7), mirroring the task\u2019s alternative objective.\nProof. Directly apply Corollary 9 on I (with \u03b7=0.98, c=2) and mix with \u03b3.\n\n### Minor constant refinements (optional)\n- In Corollary 12 with C_bi=C_fix=5, 2\u00b7C_bi\u00b7(a+1)=10\u00b7(3+1/(2e))\u224831.84. One can safely state 33 instead of 35 if desired by allocating at most 1.16 to the endpoint O(1/L) term; this is purely cosmetic.\n\n## Examples and sanity checks\n- Worst-case pattern: Taking all plateaus of length 1 (i.e., OPT changes at every k) yields E_k,++[ALG/OPT] = \u0398(log k0), matched by Lemma 1.\n- Single dyadic-long plateau: If OPT halves once across the window (L\u2248m), then B_long(1) \u2264 2\u00b7C_bi\u00b7(a+1+ln 2) and the average is constant; Corollary 2 then gives a concrete \u22651% bound with an explicit constant factor.\n\n## Heavy-coverage program: a clean conditional collision bound (clarified)\nWe crystallize a conditional, pathwise statement that reduces the heavy-collision analysis to two verifiable parameters.\n\nLemma 2 (Heavy-collision bound under dominance and covered-cost control).\nLet H be a set of k1 \u201cheavy\u201d optimal clusters (in the k-clustering P). Assume that up to the stopping time \u03c4 when all heavy clusters are first covered, for every t<\u03c4,\n- Dominance: U_t(H) \u2265 \u03b2 \u00b7 ( H_t(all) + U_t(L) ) for some \u03b2>0; and\n- Covered-heavy control: H_t(H) \u2264 \u03b1 \u00b7 S_H, where S_H := \u2211_{P\u2208H} OPT1(P), \u03b1\u22651 is an absolute constant (\u03b1=5 suffices in expectation via the MRS Lemma 4.1; pathwise we can enforce H_t(H) \u2264 eH_t(H) \u2264 5 S_H). \nThen the expected number of times k-means++ samples a point from a covered heavy cluster before \u03c4 is at most k1 \u00b7 ( \u03b1/(\u03b2+1) ) \u00b7 (S_H/inf_{t<\u03c4} U_t(H)). In particular, if inf_{t<\u03c4} U_t(H) \u2265 S_H (a strong persistence condition), then E[# heavy-collisions] \u2264 k1\u00b7\u03b1/(\u03b2+1).\nWhy useful. This isolates the role of a quantitative persistence lower bound on U_t(H) and converts it into an explicit expected-collisions bound. It also cleanly uses the pathwise inequality H_t(H) \u2264 eH_t(H) and the supermartingale eH_t.\nProof sketch. At step t<\u03c4, conditional collision probability is p_t := H_t(H)/cost_t(X). By dominance, cost_t(X) = U_t(H) + (H_t(all)+U_t(L)) \u2264 U_t(H)\u00b7(1 + 1/\u03b2). Hence p_t \u2264 (\u03b1 S_H)/((1+1/\u03b2) U_t(H)). Each sample that lands in heavy either covers a new heavy cluster or collides. Summing per-step collision probabilities over the at most k1 heavy hits and lower-bounding U_t(H) by inf_{t<\u03c4} U_t(H) yields the bound.\nNext step. Derive a sufficient condition (in terms of OPT-scale separation and/or geometric separation) implying inf_{t<\u03c4} U_t(H) \u2265 c\u00b7S_H with c>0 and \u03b2=poly(1), then lift expectation to high probability by Freedman\u2019s inequality for supermartingales.\n\n## Obstacles and open items\n- Unconditional improvement barrier. Lemma 1 confirms that without structural constraints, the average cannot beat \u0398(log k0), aligning with the fixed-k lower bounds.\n- Heavy-coverage derivation from OPT-separation. The key missing piece remains a principled lower bound on U_t(H) in terms of S_H under a scale-separation hypothesis (e.g., OPT_{k1} \u226b OPT_k). We need to quantify how much sampling outside H can decrease U_t(H) before heavy clusters are hit; this likely requires a refined use of the eH_t supermartingale and per-cluster contributions.\n\n## Next steps (concrete, verifiable)\n1) Curate Lemma 1 and Corollary 1 into output.md to document unconditional aggregation and explicit mixture with long plateau mass.\n2) Add Corollary 2 as a global \u22651% probability statement (with \u03b7=0.98, c=2) and explicit constants, referencing Corollary 9.\n3) Optionally tighten Corollary 12\u2019s leading constant from 35 to 33, or annotate why 35 is a conservative rounding.\n4) For heavy-coverage, formalize Lemma 2 in output.md only after we pin down a verifiable persistence condition; in the meantime, attempt to prove inf_{t<\u03c4} U_t(H) \u2265 c\u00b7S_H and \u03b2=\u03a9(1) under a clean geometric or OPT separation hypothesis.\n5) Provide a compact \u201cregime chart\u201d illustrating which of the three branches dominates as a function of L/m, to guide users of the envelope (purely expository, no new math).\n"
