Round 0005 — Audit, small fixes, and new, checkable corollaries for global aggregation and probability

Summary of audit of output.md
- The new τ≈m/ln L branch (Corollary 10), the min-of-three per-plateau envelope (Corollary 11), and explicit constants for C_bi=C_fix=5 (Corollary 12) are all correct and valuable. The “≥1% probability” remark now uses η=0.98, c=2, which cleanly gives 1% mass up to O(1/L).
- Minor gap to clarify: Corollary 11 explicitly restricts the third branch (m(1+ln ln L))/L to L≥3. Corollary 12 states a min-of-three for L≥2 without this restriction. For L=2, ln ln L<0, so the third term can be negative and should not be part of the minimum. Suggested fix: add “the third term is intended only for L≥3; for L=2 take the minimum of the first two terms,” mirroring Cor. 11.

New, checkable additions recommended for output.md

1) Global min-of-three aggregation across plateaus (explicit statement)
- Statement (Global envelope). Let [k0,2k0) be partitioned into maximal factor-2 plateaus I_j=[m_j,m_j+L_j), j=1,…,J. Then for k uniform in [k0,2k0) and k-means++ randomness,
  E_{k,++}[ALG_k/OPT_k]
  ≤ (1/k0) Σ_{j: L_j≥2} L_j [ K0 + K1·min{ ln^+(2m_j/(L_j−1)), (m_j ln L_j)/L_j, (m_j(1+ln ln L_j))/L_j } ]
    + (K2/k0) Σ_{j: L_j≥2} ln m_j + (1/k0) Σ_{j: L_j=1} C_fix(ln m_j + O(1)).
  For C_bi=C_fix=5, one can set K0=35, K1=10, K2=5 (as in Corollary 12). For the third term in the minimum, restrict to L_j≥3.
- Why useful: This directly operationalizes Corollaries 11–12 into a window-level bound and makes the tradeoffs transparent. Proof: average Cor. 11 over each plateau with weight L_j/k0, add the Δ=0 endpoint contributions (as in Cor. 3), and handle L_j=1 via the fixed‑k bound.

2) A simple bound on the endpoint-sum contribution (unweighted log term)
- Lemma (Endpoint term cap). With notation above, (1/k0) Σ_{j: L_j≥2} ln m_j ≤ ln(2k0).
  Proof: There are at most J≤k0 plateaus and each m_j≤2k0−1, so Σ ln m_j ≤ J·ln(2k0) ≤ k0·ln(2k0). Dividing by k0 yields the claim. Consequence: the unweighted endpoint term is never more than O(ln k0), matching the worst-case Θ(ln k0) behavior already noted.

3) Long-plateau constant regime — global instantiation with explicit constants
- Corollary (Global constant under a single long plateau). Suppose there exists a plateau I=[m,m+L) with L≥α m and L/k0≥γ. Then using Corollary 5 with C_bi=5 and any L≥3,
  E_{k∈I,++}[ALG/OPT] ≤ 10·(3 + 1/(2e) + ln(2/α)) + o(1) (as L→∞).
  Therefore,
  E_{k,++}[ALG/OPT] ≤ γ·O_α(1) + (1−γ)·[the global min-of-three bound on [k0,2k0)\I].
- This is an immediate corollary of Cor. 5 and the global averaging in Item 1.

4) 1%-probability guarantee — explicit global mixing
- Corollary (≥1% mass under a long plateau). Under the same assumptions as above (L≥α m, L/k0≥γ), Corollary 9 with η=0.98 and c=2 and the Remark after Corollary 12 give
  P_{k∼U([k0,2k0)),++}[ ALG/OPT ≤ 2·B_I ] ≥ γ·(1−η−O(1/L))·(1−1/2) ≥ 0.01·γ − O(γ/L),
  with B_I = 2·C_bi·(1 + 1/(α e η)) + o(1). For C_bi=5 and α=1 this yields ALG/OPT ≤ ~20·(1 + 1/(0.98 e)) ≈ 27.7 on at least 1%·γ of the joint (k,++) mass. This directly instantiates the alternative task objective under a simple, checkable condition.

Examples and sanity checks
- Power-law OPT: OPT_k ∝ k^{−p} with p>0. Over [k0,2k0), a single factor‑2 drop occurs, so plateau lengths satisfy L ≈ (2^{1/p}−1)m = Θ(m), i.e., α=Θ_p(1). Global average is O_p(1) by Item 1.
- Worst-case short plateaus: If L_j=1 for J≈k0 plateaus, Item 2 shows the endpoint term alone is Θ(ln k0), so no unconditional improvement over Θ(ln k0) is possible via plateau calculus.

Obstacles and open tasks
- Constants for small L: For L=2, ensure the third branch is excluded in Corollary 12 (as already noted for Corollary 11). This avoids negative values from ln ln 2 in the minimum.
- Heavy-coverage program: The metric-separation special case remains promising, but a fully general scale-separation-to-persistence derivation is open. Next concrete step: quantify a denominator lower bound cost_t(X) ≥ β·U_t(H) under explicit geometric or separation assumptions, then sum conditional collision probabilities rigorously.

Next steps (concrete and verifiable)
1) Add the global min-of-three aggregation statement (Item 1) to output.md with the explicit constants option for C_bi=C_fix=5; include the L≥3 restriction for the third branch in both Corollaries 11 and 12.
2) Add the endpoint-sum cap lemma (Item 2) as a remark to bound the contribution of Δ=0 endpoints globally by ≤ ln(2k0)·K2.
3) Include the long-plateau global corollary and the 1%-probability global instantiation (Items 3–4), which follow immediately from existing corollaries.
4) Heavy-coverage: attempt a formal bound of the form E[U_{t+1}(H) | F_t, sample outside H] ≥ (1−ε/R)·U_t(H) under a scale separation R≥k^C plus a mild geometric regularity, then proceed to an expected-collisions bound via conditional probability summation.

Why these are incremental and auditable
- All additions are direct aggregations or instantiations of existing per-plateau results, with short proofs and explicit constants.
- The minor fix in Corollary 12 (L≥3 restriction for the third term) is precise and prevents a small edge-case pitfall.
- The probability corollary provides a clean ≥1% guarantee meeting the alternative task statement under transparent conditions.

## Quick audit of output.md (this round)
- The new τ≈m/ln L branch (Corollary 10) is stated correctly with L≥3 and uses the previously recorded remark L≤m on [k0,2k0). The inequalities τ≥m/ln L−1 ⇒ ln(2m/τ)≤ln(4 ln L), τ/(L−1)≤m/((L−1) ln L), and H_{L−2}−H_{τ−1}≤1+ln ln L are valid and inserted properly.
- The min-of-three envelope (Corollary 11) logically follows by taking the minimum of the three explicit instantiations and absorbing additive terms. The explicit-constant version for C_bi=C_fix=5 (Corollary 12) is conservative and sound. A minor constant improvement is possible (see below), but not necessary for asymptotics.
- The probability remark now uses η=0.98 and c=2 to ensure an unconditional ≥1% mass (up to O(1/L)), which fixes the earlier 0.0099 issue.

I found no correctness errors; the presentation is coherent and self-contained for the plateau calculus.

## New, checkable contributions

### Lemma 1 (Global worst-case aggregation recovers O(log k0))
Statement. Let [k0,2k0) be partitioned into maximal factor-2 plateaus I_j=[m_j,m_j+L_j) with ∑_j L_j=k0. Using the pure-log branch from Corollary 7 (and the fixed-k bound for L_j=1), we have the unconditional bound
E_{k∼U([k0,2k0)),++}[ALG_k/OPT_k] ≤ K′ + K″·ln(2k0),
for absolute constants K′,K″ depending only on C_bi,C_fix.
Why useful. This shows our framework unconditionally matches the Θ(log k0) baseline, validating that improvements necessarily require structural information on plateaus.
Sketch proof (fully checkable). For L_j≥2,
(1/k0)·L_j·ln^+(2m_j/(L_j−1)) ≤ (1/k0)·L_j(ln 2 + ln m_j) − (1/k0)·L_j·ln(L_j−1).
Summing over j and using L_j−1≥1 so the last term is ≤0, we get
(1/k0)∑_{j:L_j≥2} L_j ln^+(2m_j/(L_j−1)) ≤ ln 2 + (1/k0)∑_{j:L_j≥2} L_j ln m_j.
Now, for every k∈I_j, m_j≤k, hence ln m_j ≤ ln k. Therefore,
(1/k0)∑_{j:L_j≥2} L_j ln m_j ≤ (1/k0)∑_{k=k0}^{2k0−1} ln k ≤ ln(2k0) − 1 + o(1).
Add the endpoint terms (1/k0)∑_{j:L_j≥2} A2 ln m_j ≤ A2 ln(2k0) and the L_j=1 contribution (bounded by C_fix(ln(2k0)+O(1)) per index). Multiplying by the fixed absolute coefficients from Corollaries 2 and 7 and absorbing constants yields the displayed K′+K″ ln(2k0) bound.

### Corollary 1 (Mixture bound with a long-plateau mass)
Statement. Suppose the set J_long of plateaus satisfying L_j ≥ α m_j covers a γ-fraction of [k0,2k0), i.e., ∑_{j∈J_long} L_j ≥ γ k0, where α,γ∈(0,1]. Then
E_{k}[ALG/OPT] ≤ γ·B_long(α) + (1−γ)·(K′ + K″·ln(2k0)) + O((1/k0)∑_j ln m_j),
with B_long(α) = 2·C_bi·(a+1+ln(2/α)) (cf. Corollary 5) and absolute K′,K″ from Lemma 1.
Why useful. This gives a clean, global interpolation: any nontrivial mass γ of long plateaus pushes the average below the Θ(log k0) worst case by an additive γ·O(1), with explicit constants.
Proof sketch. Average Corollary 5 over j∈J_long with weights L_j/k0 (giving ≤γ·B_long(α)+o(1)), and use Lemma 1 on the complement. The endpoint O((ln m_j)/L_j) terms aggregate into O((1/k0)∑_j ln m_j) ≤ O(ln(2k0)).

### Corollary 2 (Global ≥1% probability guarantee under a single long plateau)
Statement. If some plateau I=[m,m+L) satisfies L ≥ α m and covers a γ-fraction of [k0,2k0), then for k uniform on [k0,2k0) and ++ randomness,
P[ ALG_k/OPT_k ≤ 2·B_I ] ≥ γ·(0.5−O(1/L))·0.5 ≥ 0.01−o(1)
for parameters η=0.98, c=2 in Corollary 9, with B_I=2·C_bi·(1 + 1/(α e η)) + O(1/L).
Why useful. This is a global, fully explicit ≥1% probability guarantee under a single structural condition on OPT(·), mirroring the task’s alternative objective.
Proof. Directly apply Corollary 9 on I (with η=0.98, c=2) and mix with γ.

### Minor constant refinements (optional)
- In Corollary 12 with C_bi=C_fix=5, 2·C_bi·(a+1)=10·(3+1/(2e))≈31.84. One can safely state 33 instead of 35 if desired by allocating at most 1.16 to the endpoint O(1/L) term; this is purely cosmetic.

## Examples and sanity checks
- Worst-case pattern: Taking all plateaus of length 1 (i.e., OPT changes at every k) yields E_k,++[ALG/OPT] = Θ(log k0), matched by Lemma 1.
- Single dyadic-long plateau: If OPT halves once across the window (L≈m), then B_long(1) ≤ 2·C_bi·(a+1+ln 2) and the average is constant; Corollary 2 then gives a concrete ≥1% bound with an explicit constant factor.

## Heavy-coverage program: a clean conditional collision bound (clarified)
We crystallize a conditional, pathwise statement that reduces the heavy-collision analysis to two verifiable parameters.

Lemma 2 (Heavy-collision bound under dominance and covered-cost control).
Let H be a set of k1 “heavy” optimal clusters (in the k-clustering P). Assume that up to the stopping time τ when all heavy clusters are first covered, for every t<τ,
- Dominance: U_t(H) ≥ β · ( H_t(all) + U_t(L) ) for some β>0; and
- Covered-heavy control: H_t(H) ≤ α · S_H, where S_H := ∑_{P∈H} OPT1(P), α≥1 is an absolute constant (α=5 suffices in expectation via the MRS Lemma 4.1; pathwise we can enforce H_t(H) ≤ eH_t(H) ≤ 5 S_H). 
Then the expected number of times k-means++ samples a point from a covered heavy cluster before τ is at most k1 · ( α/(β+1) ) · (S_H/inf_{t<τ} U_t(H)). In particular, if inf_{t<τ} U_t(H) ≥ S_H (a strong persistence condition), then E[# heavy-collisions] ≤ k1·α/(β+1).
Why useful. This isolates the role of a quantitative persistence lower bound on U_t(H) and converts it into an explicit expected-collisions bound. It also cleanly uses the pathwise inequality H_t(H) ≤ eH_t(H) and the supermartingale eH_t.
Proof sketch. At step t<τ, conditional collision probability is p_t := H_t(H)/cost_t(X). By dominance, cost_t(X) = U_t(H) + (H_t(all)+U_t(L)) ≤ U_t(H)·(1 + 1/β). Hence p_t ≤ (α S_H)/((1+1/β) U_t(H)). Each sample that lands in heavy either covers a new heavy cluster or collides. Summing per-step collision probabilities over the at most k1 heavy hits and lower-bounding U_t(H) by inf_{t<τ} U_t(H) yields the bound.
Next step. Derive a sufficient condition (in terms of OPT-scale separation and/or geometric separation) implying inf_{t<τ} U_t(H) ≥ c·S_H with c>0 and β=poly(1), then lift expectation to high probability by Freedman’s inequality for supermartingales.

## Obstacles and open items
- Unconditional improvement barrier. Lemma 1 confirms that without structural constraints, the average cannot beat Θ(log k0), aligning with the fixed-k lower bounds.
- Heavy-coverage derivation from OPT-separation. The key missing piece remains a principled lower bound on U_t(H) in terms of S_H under a scale-separation hypothesis (e.g., OPT_{k1} ≫ OPT_k). We need to quantify how much sampling outside H can decrease U_t(H) before heavy clusters are hit; this likely requires a refined use of the eH_t supermartingale and per-cluster contributions.

## Next steps (concrete, verifiable)
1) Curate Lemma 1 and Corollary 1 into output.md to document unconditional aggregation and explicit mixture with long plateau mass.
2) Add Corollary 2 as a global ≥1% probability statement (with η=0.98, c=2) and explicit constants, referencing Corollary 9.
3) Optionally tighten Corollary 12’s leading constant from 35 to 33, or annotate why 35 is a conservative rounding.
4) For heavy-coverage, formalize Lemma 2 in output.md only after we pin down a verifiable persistence condition; in the meantime, attempt to prove inf_{t<τ} U_t(H) ≥ c·S_H and β=Ω(1) under a clean geometric or OPT separation hypothesis.
5) Provide a compact “regime chart” illustrating which of the three branches dominates as a function of L/m, to guide users of the envelope (purely expository, no new math).
