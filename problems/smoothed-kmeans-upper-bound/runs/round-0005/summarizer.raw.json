Both provers flagged the same minor edge-case: the third branch involving (m(1+ln ln L))/L should be restricted to L≥3 to avoid negative ln ln L for L=2. They proposed several direct, checkable global additions: (i) a global min-of-three aggregation across factor-2 plateaus with explicit constants (K0=35,K1=10,K2=5), (ii) an endpoint-sum cap lemma (endpoint contribution ≤ ln(2k0)), (iii) a long-plateau global corollary giving constant average on large plateaus, and (iv) an explicit ≥1% probability guarantee using η=0.98, c=2. Prover-02 also supplied an unconditional worst-case lemma recovering E[ALG/OPT] = O(1)+O(ln k0) and a heavy-coverage Lemma that reduces collision-control to proving a persistence lower bound inf_{t<τ} U_t(H) ≥ c·S_H under scale/geometric separation.
