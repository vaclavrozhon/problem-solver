  "summary_md": "Round 0005 audit: two independent checks validated the new τ≈m/ln L branch, the min-of-three per-plateau envelope, and the explicit-constant instantiation (C_bi=C_fix=5). Both provers flagged the same minor edge-case: the third branch involving (m(1+ln ln L))/L should be restricted to L≥3 to avoid negative ln ln L for L=2. They proposed several direct, checkable global additions: (i) a global min-of-three aggregation across factor-2 plateaus with explicit constants (K0=35,K1=10,K2=5), (ii) an endpoint-sum cap lemma (endpoint contribution ≤ ln(2k0)), (iii) a long-plateau global corollary giving constant average on large plateaus, and (iv) an explicit ≥1% probability guarantee using η=0.98, c=2. Prover-02 also supplied an unconditional worst-case lemma recovering E[ALG/OPT] = O(1)+O(ln k0) and a heavy-coverage Lemma that reduces collision-control to proving a persistence lower bound inf_{t<τ} U_t(H) ≥ c·S_H under scale/geometric separation. Main remaining work: formalize that persistence bound to complete the heavy-coverage program. Files: prover-01.out.json and prover-02.out.json (Round 0005). Verifier: partial success.",
  "highlights": [
    "Corollary 10 (τ ≈ m/ln L) and its supporting inequalities are correct for L ≥ 3; the τ-inequalities were inserted and checked.",
    "The min-of-three per-plateau envelope (Corollary 11) and explicit-constant Corollary 12 (C_bi=C_fix=5) are sound; both auditors recommend restricting the third branch to L ≥ 3 to avoid ln ln issues at L=2.",
    "Global aggregation proposed: average the per-plateau bounds to get a window-level min-of-three envelope with explicit constants (K0=35, K1=10, K2=5) and an L≥3 caveat for the third term.",
    "Endpoint-sum cap lemma: (1/k0)·Σ_{j: L_j≥2} ln m_j ≤ ln(2k0), limiting the unweighted endpoint contribution to O(ln k0).",
    "Unconditional worst-case lemma (Prover-02): the framework recovers E[ALG/OPT] ≤ K' + K''·ln(2k0), so improvements require structural plateau mass.",
    "Heavy-coverage reduction (Prover-02 Lemma 2): expected heavy-collisions are controlled if one can show persistence inf_{t<τ} U_t(H) ≥ c·S_H and a dominance parameter β=Ω(1)."

    "Add the global min-of-three aggregation, the endpoint-sum cap lemma, the long-plateau global corollary, and the ≥1% probability corollary to output.md with the explicit constants and the L≥3 restriction for the third branch (implementation / editorial task).",
    "Formalize the heavy-coverage persistence condition: prove a verifiable lower bound inf_{t<τ} U_t(H) ≥ c·S_H (and dominance β=Ω(1)) under explicit scale-separation or mild geometric assumptions, then derive expected and high-probability collision bounds (main open mathematical task).",
    "Optionally tighten or annotate constants in Corollary 12 (e.g., justify changing 35→33) and document the regime chart mapping which branch dominates as a function of L/m (expository task)."
