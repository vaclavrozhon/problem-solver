  "feedback_md": "Both prover reports are consistent with the current plateau calculus and aggregation framework, and the proposed additions are largely clean aggregations or instantiations of already proven per-plateau statements. I verified the following points carefully:\n\n1) Global min-of-three aggregation. This is straightforward: apply Corollary 11 on each plateau with weight L_j/k0 and add the L_j=1 (\u0394=0) cases via the fixed-k bound. The explicit constants when C_bi=C_fix=5 (K0=35, K1=10, K2=5) are conservative and compatible with Corollary 12. One must explicitly restrict the third branch (m(1+ln ln L))/L to L\u22653; otherwise it can be negative when L=2. Corollary 11 already states this; Corollary 12 should be clarified similarly.\n\n2) Endpoint term cap. The bound (1/k0)\u2211_{j:L_j\u22652} ln m_j \u2264 ln(2k0) is correct and useful to keep global bounds tidy. It is a simple observation: there are \u2264k0 plateaus and each m_j\u22642k0\u22121.\n\n3) Unconditional O(log k0) global bound. Using the log branch alone (Theorem 2/Corollary 7 with \u03c4=L\u22121) and the observation that for k\u2208I_j we have ln m_j\u2264ln k, gives (1/k0)\u2211_j L_j ln^+(2m_j/(L_j\u22121)) \u2264 ln 2 + (1/k0)\u2211_{k=k0}^{2k0\u22121} ln k \u2264 O(ln k0). Adding the endpoint and L_j=1 terms yields a clean K\u2032+K\u2033 ln(2k0) bound depending only on C_bi,C_fix.\n\n4) Long-plateau mixture and \u22651% probability. Averaging Corollary 5 over any plateau mass \u03b3 (L_j\u2265\u03b1 m_j) yields a \u03b3\u00b7O_\u03b1(1) contribution, and combining with the unconditional O(log k0) fallback gives a transparent mixture bound. For the probability statement, mixing Corollary 9 with \u03b7=0.98 and c=2 across a plateau covering \u03b3 of the window gives P[ALG/OPT \u2264 2\u00b7B_I] \u2265 \u03b3\u00b7(1\u2212\u03b7\u2212O(1/L))\u00b7(1\u22121/2) = 0.01\u00b7\u03b3 \u2212 O(\u03b3/L). Note: one prover draft accidentally dropped the \u03b3 factor in the final inequality; we keep it explicitly.\n\n5) Heavy-coverage. The pathwise collision lemma sketched by Prover 02 is not yet output-ready. In particular, claims like H_t(H) \u2264 eH_t(H) \u2264 5 S_H \u201cpathwise\u201d need precise definitions (the eH_t supermartingale is an expectation tool; pathwise inequalities require care). The right next step is to formalize a persistence lower bound inf_{t<\u03c4} U_t(H) \u2265 c\u00b7S_H under an explicit scale/geometry hypothesis, and then sum conditional collision probabilities; concentration can be added afterwards (e.g., Freedman).\n\nActions taken: we appended (i) a clarification remark for Corollary 12 (L\u22653 for the third branch), (ii) a global min-of-three aggregation corollary (with explicit constants for C_bi=C_fix=5), (iii) an endpoint-sum cap lemma, (iv) an unconditional O(log k0) global bound, (v) a global long-plateau mixture corollary, and (vi) a global \u22651% probability corollary. These are all short, rigorous consequences of existing results.\n\nNext steps (concrete):\n- Quantify a clean sufficient condition implying many long plateaus (e.g., OPT_k following a power-law or regular variation) and translate it into a global O(1) or O(log log k0) average; include a formal statement and proof.\n- Pursue the heavy-coverage program: precisely define H_t, U_t, the stopping time \u03c4, and demonstrate a persistence lower bound U_t(H) \u2265 c\u00b7S_H up to \u03c4 under OPT-scale separation; then sum conditional collision probabilities to get E[collisions] \u2264 O(k1/c) and lift to high probability via Freedman.\n- Optional constant tightening (e.g., 35\u219233) only after we fully audit small-L endpoint constants; currently 35 is robust and safe.\n",
  "new_notes_md": "Global aggregation and probability instantiations (added)\n\n- Global min-of-three aggregator. From Corollary 11 (per-plateau min-of-three) and linearity, we can average over the maximal factor-2 plateau partition [k0,2k0)=\u2294_j I_j=[m_j,m_j+L_j). For L_j\u22652 each plateau contributes its per-plateau bound with weight L_j/k0, and L_j=1 plateaus contribute via the fixed-k bound. This yields a clean, explicit global formula with constants K0,K1,K2 depending only on C_bi,C_fix. When C_bi=C_fix=5, one can set K0=35, K1=10, K2=5. The third branch (m(1+ln ln L))/L is to be read only for L\u22653.\n\n- Endpoint-sum control. The unweighted endpoint contribution aggregates as (K2/k0)\u2211_{j:L_j\u22652} ln m_j. This is always \u2264 K2\u00b7ln(2k0) since there are \u2264k0 plateaus and m_j\u22642k0\u22121 for all j. Thus endpoint terms never exceed O(ln k0).\n\n- Unconditional aggregation bound. Using only the pure-log branch and the easy inequality ln m_j \u2264 ln k for k\u2208I_j, we recover E_{k\u223cU([k0,2k0)),++}[ALG/OPT] \u2264 K\u2032 + K\u2033\u00b7ln(2k0) for absolute K\u2032,K\u2033. This validates that, without structural information (e.g., long plateaus), the \u0398(log k0) behavior is unavoidable.\n\n- Long-plateau mixture. If a \u03b3-fraction of the window is covered by plateaus with L\u2265\u03b1 m, then that portion contributes \u03b3\u00b7O_\u03b1(1) (by Corollary 5), while the rest is \u2264 (1\u2212\u03b3)\u00b7O(ln k0). This gives a transparent global interpolation.\n\n- \u22651% global probability under a single long plateau. If I=[m,m+L) with L\u2265\u03b1 m covers a \u03b3-fraction of the window, then by Corollary 9 with \u03b7=0.98 and c=2 we get P_{k,++}[ALG/OPT \u2264 2\u00b7B_I] \u2265 \u03b3\u00b7(1\u2212\u03b7\u2212O(1/L))\u00b7(1\u22121/2) = 0.01\u00b7\u03b3 \u2212 O(\u03b3/L), where B_I = 2\u00b7C_bi\u00b7(1 + m/(e(T\u22121))) and T = max{2,\u23080.98(L\u22121)\u2309+1}. If L\u2265\u03b1 m then B_I \u2264 2\u00b7C_bi(1 + 1/(\u03b1 e\u00b70.98)) + O(1/L).\n\nCaveat and next steps for heavy-coverage\n\n- The pathwise heavy-collision lemma remains a program: define U_t(H) (uncovered heavy mass), H_t(H) (covered heavy mass), and the stopping time \u03c4 when all heavy clusters are covered. A key missing ingredient is a quantitative persistence lower bound inf_{t<\u03c4} U_t(H) \u2265 c\u00b7S_H (S_H is the sum of single-cluster OPT costs over H) under an explicit separation hypothesis (e.g., OPT_{k1} \u226b OPT_k or geometric separation). Once such a bound and a dominance parameter \u03b2>0 (U_t(H) \u2265 \u03b2\u00b7(H_t(all)+U_t(L))) are established, summing conditional collision probabilities gives an expected-collisions bound, which can then be upgraded to high probability via Freedman\u2019s inequality. We should avoid any pathwise inequality that is only justified in expectation (e.g., eH_t supermartingale bounds) without a concentration argument.\n",

  "new_outputs_md": "Remark (Clarification on Corollary 12).\nIn Corollary 12 the third term inside the minimum, (m(1+ln ln L))/L, is intended only for L\u22653.
