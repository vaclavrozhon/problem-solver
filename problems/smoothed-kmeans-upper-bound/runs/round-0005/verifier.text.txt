{"feedback_md":"Both prover reports are consistent with the current plateau calculus and aggregation framework, and the proposed additions are largely clean aggregations or instantiations of already proven per-plateau statements. I verified the following points carefully:\n\n1) Global min-of-three aggregation. This is straightforward: apply Corollary 11 on each plateau with weight L_j/k0 and add the L_j=1 (Δ=0) cases via the fixed-k bound. The explicit constants when C_bi=C_fix=5 (K0=35, K1=10, K2=5) are conservative and compatible with Corollary 12. One must explicitly restrict the third branch (m(1+ln ln L))/L to L≥3; otherwise it can be negative when L=2. Corollary 11 already states this; Corollary 12 should be clarified similarly.\n\n2) Endpoint term cap. The bound (1/k0)∑_{j:L_j≥2} ln m_j ≤ ln(2k0) is correct and useful to keep global bounds tidy. It is a simple observation: there are ≤k0 plateaus and each m_j≤2k0−1.\n\n3) Unconditional O(log k0) global bound. Using the log branch alone (Theorem 2/Corollary 7 with τ=L−1) and the observation that for k∈I_j we have ln m_j≤ln k, gives (1/k0)∑_j L_j ln^+(2m_j/(L_j−1)) ≤ ln 2 + (1/k0)∑_{k=k0}^{2k0−1} ln k ≤ O(ln k0). Adding the endpoint and L_j=1 terms yields a clean K′+K″ ln(2k0) bound depending only on C_bi,C_fix.\n\n4) Long-plateau mixture and ≥1% probability. Averaging Corollary 5 over any plateau mass γ (L_j≥α m_j) yields a γ·O_α(1) contribution, and combining with the unconditional O(log k0) fallback gives a transparent mixture bound. For the probability statement, mixing Corollary 9 with η=0.98 and c=2 across a plateau covering γ of the window gives P[ALG/OPT ≤ 2·B_I] ≥ γ·(1−η−O(1/L))·(1−1/2) = 0.01·γ − O(γ/L). Note: one prover draft accidentally dropped the γ factor in the final inequality; we keep it explicitly.\n\n5) Heavy-coverage. The pathwise collision lemma sketched by Prover 02 is not yet output-ready. In particular, claims like H_t(H) ≤ eH_t(H) ≤ 5 S_H “pathwise” need precise definitions (the eH_t supermartingale is an expectation tool; pathwise inequalities require care). The right next step is to formalize a persistence lower bound inf_{t<τ} U_t(H) ≥ c·S_H under an explicit scale/geometry hypothesis, and then sum conditional collision probabilities; concentration can be added afterwards (e.g., Freedman).\n\nActions taken: we appended (i) a clarification remark for Corollary 12 (L≥3 for the third branch), (ii) a global min-of-three aggregation corollary (with explicit constants for C_bi=C_fix=5), (iii) an endpoint-sum cap lemma, (iv) an unconditional O(log k0) global bound, (v) a global long-plateau mixture corollary, and (vi) a global ≥1% probability corollary. These are all short, rigorous consequences of existing results.\n\nNext steps (concrete):\n- Quantify a clean sufficient condition implying many long plateaus (e.g., OPT_k following a power-law or regular variation) and translate it into a global O(1) or O(log log k0) average; include a formal statement and proof.\n- Pursue the heavy-coverage program: precisely define H_t, U_t, the stopping time τ, and demonstrate a persistence lower bound U_t(H) ≥ c·S_H up to τ under OPT-scale separation; then sum conditional collision probabilities to get E[collisions] ≤ O(k1/c) and lift to high probability via Freedman.\n- Optional constant tightening (e.g., 35→33) only after we fully audit small-L endpoint constants; currently 35 is robust and safe.\n","new_notes_md":"Global aggregation and probability instantiations (added)\n\n- Global min-of-three aggregator. From Corollary 11 (per-plateau min-of-three) and linearity, we can average over the maximal factor-2 plateau partition [k0,2k0)=⊔_j I_j=[m_j,m_j+L_j). For L_j≥2 each plateau contributes its per-plateau bound with weight L_j/k0, and L_j=1 plateaus contribute via the fixed-k bound. This yields a clean, explicit global formula with constants K0,K1,K2 depending only on C_bi,C_fix. When C_bi=C_fix=5, one can set K0=35, K1=10, K2=5. The third branch (m(1+ln ln L))/L is to be read only for L≥3.\n\n- Endpoint-sum control. The unweighted endpoint contribution aggregates as (K2/k0)∑_{j:L_j≥2} ln m_j. This is always ≤ K2·ln(2k0) since there are ≤k0 plateaus and m_j≤2k0−1 for all j. Thus endpoint terms never exceed O(ln k0).\n\n- Unconditional aggregation bound. Using only the pure-log branch and the easy inequality ln m_j ≤ ln k for k∈I_j, we recover E_{k∼U([k0,2k0)),++}[ALG/OPT] ≤ K′ + K″·ln(2k0) for absolute K′,K″. This validates that, without structural information (e.g., long plateaus), the Θ(log k0) behavior is unavoidable.\n\n- Long-plateau mixture. If a γ-fraction of the window is covered by plateaus with L≥α m, then that portion contributes γ·O_α(1) (by Corollary 5), while the rest is ≤ (1−γ)·O(ln k0). This gives a transparent global interpolation.\n\n- ≥1% global probability under a single long plateau. If I=[m,m+L) with L≥α m covers a γ-fraction of the window, then by Corollary 9 with η=0.98 and c=2 we get P_{k,++}[ALG/OPT ≤ 2·B_I] ≥ γ·(1−η−O(1/L))·(1−1/2) = 0.01·γ − O(γ/L), where B_I = 2·C_bi·(1 + m/(e(T−1))) and T = max{2,⌈0.98(L−1)⌉+1}. If L≥α m then B_I ≤ 2·C_bi(1 + 1/(α e·0.98)) + O(1/L).\n\nCaveat and next steps for heavy-coverage\n\n- The pathwise heavy-collision lemma remains a program: define U_t(H) (uncovered heavy mass), H_t(H) (covered heavy mass), and the stopping time τ when all heavy clusters are covered. A key missing ingredient is a quantitative persistence lower bound inf_{t<τ} U_t(H) ≥ c·S_H (S_H is the sum of single-cluster OPT costs over H) under an explicit separation hypothesis (e.g., OPT_{k1} ≫ OPT_k or geometric separation). Once such a bound and a dominance parameter β>0 (U_t(H) ≥ β·(H_t(all)+U_t(L))) are established, summing conditional collision probabilities gives an expected-collisions bound, which can then be upgraded to high probability via Freedman’s inequality. We should avoid any pathwise inequality that is only justified in expectation (e.g., eH_t supermartingale bounds) without a concentration argument.\n","new_notes_append":"True","new_outputs_md":"Remark (Clarification on Corollary 12).\nIn Corollary 12 the third term inside the minimum, (m(1+ln ln L))/L, is intended only for L≥3. For L=2, take the minimum of the first two terms. This mirrors the restriction stated in Corollary 11 and avoids using ln ln 2<0.\n\nCorollary 13 (Global min-of-three aggregation across plateaus; explicit constants available).\nPartition [k0,2k0) into maximal factor-2 plateaus I_j=[m_j,m_j+L_j), j=1,…,J, so that ∑_j L_j=k0.

Sum over j. The constants K0,K1,K2 come directly from Corollaries 11–12. ∎\n\nLemma 1 (Endpoint term cap).\nWith the notation of Corollary 13,\n  (1/k0) ∑_{j:L_j≥2} ln m_j ≤ ln(2k0).\nProof.\nThere are at most J≤k0 plateaus and for all j we have m_j≤2k0−1. Thus ∑_{j:L_j≥2} ln m_j ≤ ∑_{j=1}^{J} ln(2k0) ≤ k0·ln(2k0). Divide by k0. ∎\n\nCorollary 14 (Unconditional global O(log k0) bound).\nThere exist absolute constants K′,K″ (depending only on C_bi,C_fix) such that for k uniform on [k0,2k0) and ++ randomness,\n  E_{k,++}[ ALG_k / OPT_k ] ≤ K′ + K″ · ln(2k0).\nProof.\nUse Theorem 2 (or Corollary 7 with τ=L−1) on each plateau with L_j≥2 and average with weights L_j/k0, and handle L_j=1 via the fixed-k bound.

The endpoint term is bounded by Lemma 1 up to a constant factor, and the L_j=1 part contributes ≤ C_fix·(ln(2k0)+O(1)).

In particular, as L→∞ the term (C_fix·(\\ln m))/L=o(1), so the γ-contribution is O_α(1).\nProof.\nAverage Corollary 5 over I (weight L/k0=γ) and use Corollary 14 on the complement fraction 1−γ. ∎\n\nCorollary 16 (Global ≥1% probability under a single long plateau; explicit constants).\nUnder the assumptions of Corollary 15, let η=0.98, c=2, and define T:=max{2,⌈η(L−1)⌉+1} and\n  B_I := 2·C_bi · ( 1 + m / ( e (T−1) ) ).\nThen, for k uniform on [k0,2k0) and ++ randomness,\n  P[ ALG_k / OPT_k ≤ c · B_I ] ≥ γ · (1−η−O(1/L)) · (1 − 1/c) = 0.01·γ − O(γ/L).\nIf moreover L ≥ α m, then B_I ≤ 2·C_bi · (1 + 1/(α e η)) + O(1/L).
