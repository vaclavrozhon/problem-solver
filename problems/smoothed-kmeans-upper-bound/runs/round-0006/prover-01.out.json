  "progress_md": "Round 0006 \u2014 Audit, minor clarifications, and new, checkable additions (balanced split, multi-plateau probability, and a quantified O(log log k0) mixture)\n\nQuick audit of output.md (minor points and clarifications)\n- Absorbing small 1/L terms into constants. In Corollary 8 the step \u201cabsorb constants into K0 and the terms (ln m)/(L\u22121), (m/(L\u22121)) into K2(ln m)/L and K1(m ln L)/L\u201d is sound when used as an upper envelope: for L\u22652, (ln(2m))/(L\u22121) \u2264 2(ln m)/L + O(1), and a/(L\u22121) \u2264 a, so additive O(1/L) pieces can be folded into K0. It may help to add a one-line remark justifying these two inequalities to prevent confusion.\n- Third branch domain. The L\u22653 restriction is now clearly stated in Corollaries 11\u201312 and a clarifying remark follows, which fixes the earlier edge case (ln ln 2<0).\n- Endpoint term accounting. Lemma 1 bounds the aggregated endpoint term by \u2264 ln(2k0), which is sufficient for all global combinations used later.\nI see no correctness issues; below I add compact, checkable refinements that can be curated next.\n\nNew, checkable corollaries and remarks\n\n1) Balanced-split corollary (mid-split \u03c4=\u230aL/2\u230b) with safe constants (fills an intermediate regime)\n- Statement. In the setting of Theorem 3 with L\u22653 and \u03c4:=\u230aL/2\u230b, for k uniform on I=[m,m+L),\n  E_{k\u2208I} E_++[ALG/OPT]\n  \u2264 2 C_bi [ (2/3)(a + 1 + ln(4m/(L\u22121))) + 1/2 + (m/(e(L\u22121)))(ln 3 + 1) ]\n    + (C_fix(ln m + O(1)))/L,\n  where a:=2+1/(2e).\n- Proof sketch (checkable). For L\u22653, uniformly: \u03c4/(L\u22121) \u2264 2/3; (L\u22121\u2212\u03c4)/(L\u22121) \u2264 1/2; ln(2m/\u03c4) \u2264 ln(4m/(L\u22121)); and H_{L\u22122}\u2212H_{\u03c4\u22121} \u2264 ln 3 + 1 (verify directly for L=3,4 and use monotonicity for larger L). Substitute these bounds into Theorem 3. \n- Why useful. This bounds the tail by a pure (m/L) term (up to constants), sometimes improving constants over both extremes and complementing the \u03c4\u2248m/ln L branch. It can be recorded as an optional fourth candidate in the per-plateau minimum (min-of-four), or just cited as a remark for midrange L.\n\n2) Multi-plateau 1% probability guarantee (global mixing over several long plateaus)\n- Statement. Let J_long be a family of plateaus I_j=[m_j,m_j+L_j) with L_j \u2265 \u03b1 m_j, and suppose their total coverage is \u03b3:= (1/k0)\u2211_{j\u2208J_long} L_j. Then, with \u03b7=0.98 and c=2 (as in Corollary 9),\n  P_{k\u223cU([k0,2k0)),++}[ ALG_k/OPT_k \u2264 2\u00b7B_j for k\u2208I_j for some j\u2208J_long ]\n  \u2265 \u03b3\u00b7(1\u2212\u03b7\u2212O(1/ min_j L_j))\u00b7(1\u22121/2) = 0.01\u00b7\u03b3 \u2212 O(\u03b3/ min_j L_j),\n  where for each j, B_j := 2 C_bi (1 + m_j/(e(T_j\u22121))) with T_j:=max{2,\u2308\u03b7(L_j\u22121)\u2309+1}, and hence B_j \u2264 2 C_bi (1 + 1/(\u03b1 e \u03b7)) + O(1/L_j).\n- Proof. Apply Corollary 9 on each I_j with the same (\u03b7,c), then average with weights L_j/k0. The minimum L_j controls the O(1/L_j) term in the product measure.\n- Why useful. This extends Corollary 16 from \u201cone long plateau\u201d to \u201ca union covering \u03b3 of the window,\u201d yielding a clean \u22651%\u00b7\u03b3 joint probability with the same explicit constants.\n\n3) Explicit O(log log k0) mixture under polylog-long plateaus (quantified and ready to aggregate)\n- Statement (global average). Fix \u03c3\u22651. Let S be the set of plateaus I_j with L_j \u2265 m_j/(ln k0)^\u03c3, and suppose \u2211_{j\u2208S} L_j \u2265 \u03b3 k0. Then, for k uniform on [k0,2k0) and ++ randomness,\n  E[ALG/OPT] \u2264 \u03b3\u00b7[ 2 C_bi (a+1+ln(2(ln k0)^\u03c3)) ] + (1\u2212\u03b3)\u00b7[K\u2032 + K\u2033 ln(2k0)] + o(1)\n  = \u03b3\u00b7[ 2 C_bi (a+1+ln 2 + \u03c3 ln ln k0) ] + (1\u2212\u03b3)\u00b7[K\u2032 + K\u2033 ln(2k0)] + o(1).\n- Proof. On each I_j\u2208S, Corollary 5 with \u03b1=1/(ln k0)^\u03c3 gives a per-plateau constant a+1+ln(2/\u03b1) = a+1+ln 2 + \u03c3 ln ln k0, up to o(1). Weight these by L_j/k0 and sum to get the \u03b3 term; bound the complement by Corollary 14. The endpoint terms aggregate to o(1) on S (since (ln m_j)/L_j \u2264 \u03c3 ln ln k0/(ln k0)^\u03c3) and to O(ln k0) on the complement (Lemma 1), which is absorbed into the (1\u2212\u03b3) term.\n- Why useful. This is a precise, easy-to-use version of the informal \u201cO(log log k0) on long plateaus\u201d statement with explicit dependence on \u03c3 and \u03b3 and fully tied to existing corollaries.\n\nHeavy-coverage program \u2014 a crisp conditional lemma (expectation form, with parameters explicit)\n- Lemma (expected heavy-collision bound under persistence and covered-cost control). Let H be k1 optimal clusters designated \u201cheavy,\u201d and let S_H:=\u2211_{P\u2208H} OPT1(P). Define U_t(H) (uncovered heavy cost at step t), H_t(all) and U_t(L) as usual. Suppose up to the stopping time \u03c4 (when all heavy clusters become covered):\n  (i) Persistence/dominance: U_t(H) \u2265 \u03b2\u00b7(H_t(all) + U_t(L)) for all t<\u03c4;\n  (ii) Covered-heavy control in expectation: E[H_t(H)] \u2264 \u03b1 S_H for all t (\u03b1=5 suffices by the eH_t supermartingale and Lemma 4.1 of MRS).\n  Then the expected number of heavy-collisions (selections in already-covered heavy clusters) before \u03c4 is at most (\u03b1/(\u03b2+1))\u00b7k1\u00b7(S_H/ inf_{t<\u03c4} U_t(H)). In particular, if inf_{t<\u03c4} U_t(H) \u2265 S_H (a strong persistence), then E[collisions] \u2264 (\u03b1/(\u03b2+1))\u00b7k1.\n- Proof sketch (conditional and checkable). At step t, condition on the filtration. The collision probability into covered heavy is \u2264 H_t(H)/cost_t(X) \u2264 \u03b1 S_H/(U_t(H)+H_t(all)+U_t(L)) \u2264 \u03b1 S_H/((\u03b2+1)U_t(H)) by (i). Sum this bound over at most k1 heavy hits (each heavy step either covers a new heavy cluster or collides) and use U_t(H) \u2265 inf_{s<\u03c4} U_s(H). Take expectations and apply (ii).\n- Why useful. This isolates the coupon-collector-like collision control under explicit, testable parameters (\u03b2 and the persistence lower bound). The remaining step is to prove persistence from scale or geometric separation (e.g., OPT_{k1} \u226b OPT_k), at least in expectation.\n- Note on rigor. Unlike earlier sketches, this version avoids pathwise claims about eH_t; it uses the expectation control E[H_t(H)] \u2264 5 S_H and yields an expectation bound. High-probability control can then be pursued via Freedman\u2019s inequality once a concentration statement for eH_t is established.\n\nExamples and sanity checks\n- Dyadic single plateau (L\u2248m). Corollary 5 gives E[ALG/OPT] \u2264 2 C_bi (a+1+ln 2) + o(1). With C_bi=5 and a\u22482.183, this is \u2264 10\u00b7(3.183 + 0.693) + o(1) \u2248 38.8.\n- Polylog-long plateaus. With \u03c3=2 and \u03b3=1/2, the global bound in item 3 reads E[ALG/OPT] \u2264 0.5\u00b7[const + 2 C_bi\u00b72 ln ln k0] + 0.5\u00b7K\u2033 ln(2k0) + o(1); thus the long-plateau half contributes O(ln ln k0) explicitly.\n- Mid-split vs other branches. For L=m/20, the balanced split gives a tail \u2248 (m/L)\u00b7const \u2248 20\u00b7const; the log branch gives \u2248 ln(40) \u2248 3.69 up to constants; log dominates here (as expected). For L=m/ln m, the \u03c4\u2248m/ln L branch yields \u2248 (m/L)(1+ln ln L) \u2248 ln m (1+ ln ln ln m), which is looser than the log branch\u2019s \u2248 ln(2 ln m); again, the min picks the right regime.\n\nNext steps (concrete and verifiable)\n1) Curate the balanced-split corollary into output.md (as an optional candidate alongside the three existing branches). It is a direct instantiation of Theorem 3 with uniform, easy-to-check inequalities.\n2) Add the multi-plateau \u22651% probability corollary (item 2), which follows immediately from Corollary 9 by mixing; it generalizes Corollary 16.\n3) Add the quantified O(log log k0) mixture (item 3) as a corollary under the polylog-long-plateau condition with parameters (\u03c3,\u03b3); this formalizes a recurring use-case with explicit constants.\n4) Heavy-coverage: Try to prove a persistence bound inf_{t<\u03c4} U_t(H) \u2265 c\u00b7S_H and a \u03b2=\u03a9(1) dominance under a clean scale separation hypothesis, first in a simplified geometric regime (e.g., metric separation) and then from OPT_{k1} \u2265 k^C\u00b7OPT_k; combine with the expectation lemma above. Work towards concentration of eH_t to upgrade to high probability.\n\nWhy this advances the program\n- The balanced-split adds a simple, rigorous midrange option, improving constants in some regimes without increasing complexity.\n- The multi-plateau probability and quantified O(log log k0) mixture turn earlier informal remarks into precise, ready-to-use global statements with explicit parameters and constants.\n- The heavy-coverage conditional lemma is a clean step that avoids pathwise pitfalls and sets up the final task (proving persistence from scale/geometry separation) needed to harvest O(log(1/\u03b5)) from oversampling of the light part."
