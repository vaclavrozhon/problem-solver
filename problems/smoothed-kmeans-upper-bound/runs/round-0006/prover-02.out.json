  "progress_md": "Round 0006 \u2014 Small audits, two new \u03c4-instantiations, a discrete-smoothness-to-long-plateaus lemma, and a clearer path for probability bounds\n\nAudit of output.md (no blocking issues)\n- Corollary 11/12: The \u201cthird branch only for L\u22653\u201d restriction is now clearly documented (Remark after Cor. 12). Good.\n- Corollary 13 (global aggregation): The weights and treatment of L_j=1 via the fixed-k bound are correct. The endpoint sum cap (Lemma 1) is clean and used properly in Corollary 14.\n- Corollary 16: The global \u22651% probability lower bound properly carries the plateau mass factor \u03b3. Constants are explicit.\nNo correctness errors spotted. The additions below are meant to tighten the per-plateau envelope with simple, checkable instantiations and to connect \u201cdiscrete smoothness\u201d of OPT(\u00b7) to long plateaus.\n\nNew, checkable per-plateau corollaries (to add after Corollary 10)\n1) Balanced-split with hard constants (\u03c4 = \u230aL/2\u230b)\nStatement. In Theorem 3, for L\u22653 and \u03c4:=\u230aL/2\u230b, for k uniform on I=[m,m+L):\nE_{k\u2208I} E_++[ALG/OPT] \u2264 2\u00b7C_bi [ (2/3)(a+1+ln(4m/(L\u22121))) + 1/2 + (m/(e(L\u22121)))(ln 3 + 1) ] + (C_fix(ln m + O(1)))/L,\nwith a:=2+1/(2e).\nJustification (fully checkable): For L\u22653 and \u03c4=\u230aL/2\u230b we have \u03c4/(L\u22121) \u2264 2/3; (L\u22121\u2212\u03c4)/(L\u22121) \u2264 1/2; ln(2m/\u03c4) \u2264 ln(4m/(L\u22121)); and H_{L\u22122}\u2212H_{\u03c4\u22121} \u2264 ln 3 + 1 (verify small-L cases directly). Substitute these bounds into Theorem 3. Why useful. This removes the ln L factor in the harmonic tail, replacing (m ln L)/L by a pure (m/L) term at the expense of a larger constant on the logarithmic piece. It can be tighter than both existing extremes in midrange regimes.\n\n2) Constant-tail split (\u03c4 \u2248 (L\u22121)/e)\nStatement. In Theorem 3, for L\u22653 and \u03c4:=\u230a(L\u22121)/e\u230b \u2265 1,\nE_{k\u2208I} E_++[ALG/OPT] \u2264 2\u00b7C_bi [ (1/e)(a+1+ln(2em/(L\u22121))) + (1\u22121/e) + (m/(e(L\u22121)))\u00b72 ] + (C_fix(ln m + O(1)))/L.\nJustification. With \u03c4\u2248(L\u22121)/e, we have \u03c4/(L\u22121) \u2264 1/e and (L\u22121\u2212\u03c4)/(L\u22121) \u2264 1\u22121/e. For the harmonic tail, H_{L\u22122}\u2212H_{\u03c4\u22121} \u2264 ln((L\u22121)/(\u03c4))+1 \u2264 ln e + 1 = 2. Finally ln(2m/\u03c4) \u2264 ln(2em/(L\u22121)). Substitute into Theorem 3. Why useful. This gives a third, fully explicit branch with a constant harmonic tail contribution 2\u00b7(m/(e(L\u22121))), i.e., a clean O(m/L) tail with a small constant, and a logarithmic piece whose coefficient is 1/e of that in the pure-log term. It sometimes improves over \u03c4=1 for moderate L when ln L is not small but m/L is.\n\nRemarks on regime selection (min-of-five)\n- The per-plateau min may be extended to five branches: \u03c4\u2208{L\u22121, 1, \u230am/ln L\u230b, \u230aL/2\u230b, \u230a(L\u22121)/e\u230b}. All are explicit and easy to verify. A practical recommendation is to keep the three already curated (pure-log, \u03c4=1, \u03c4=\u230am/ln L\u230b) and optionally add the constant-tail split \u03c4\u2248(L\u22121)/e when one wants a clean O(m/L) tail with a smaller constant than in the \u03c4=1 branch; the balanced-split can be listed as an optional midrange tightening.\n\nDiscrete smoothness \u21d2 long plateaus: a simple structural lemma\nLemma (discrete-smoothness-to-length). Let (v_k)_{k\u22651} be a nonincreasing positive sequence. Suppose on an interval [m, m+L) we have for some \u03b4\u2208(0,1): for all k\u2208{m+1,\u2026,m+L\u22121}, v_{k\u22121} \u2264 (1+\u03b4) v_k. Then any factor-2 drop of v_k over that interval requires L \u2265 \u2308ln 2 / ln(1+\u03b4)\u2309 \u2265 \u2308(ln 2)/\u03b4\u2309 \u2212 1.\nProof. For t steps, the total multiplicative drop is at most (1+\u03b4)^t. To drop by 2 we need (1+\u03b4)^t \u2265 2 \u21d2 t \u2265 ln 2 / ln(1+\u03b4). Since ln(1+\u03b4) \u2264 \u03b4, t \u2265 (ln 2)/\u03b4. Thus, the length L of a factor-2 plateau must satisfy L\u22121 \u2265 t, giving the displayed bound.\nCorollary (long plateau from 1/m-type smoothness). If for all k in [m,2m) we have v_{k\u22121} \u2264 (1 + A/m) v_k with some absolute A>0, then any factor-2 drop within [m,2m) requires L \u2265 c_A\u00b7m for c_A:= (ln 2)/A \u2212 o(1). In particular, L \u2265 \u03b1 m for \u03b1:= (ln 2)/A \u2212 \u03b5 once m is large, hence Corollary 5 applies and the plateau contributes O_\u03b1(1) to the average.\nWhy useful here. Instantiating v_k := OPT(k), this gives a simple, checkable surrogate for \u201clong plateaus\u201d: if the discrete per-step multiplicative decay OPT(k\u22121)/OPT(k) is at most (1+A/m) on [m,2m), then the corresponding dyadic-scale plateau inside that window is long (L \u2273 m), yielding a constant per-plateau bound and, if such windows occupy a \u03b3-fraction of [k0,2k0), a global mixture bound of the form Corollary 15. This isolates a data-agnostic regularity condition that implies the beneficial \u201coversampling by randomizing k.\u201d\n\nProbability \u2265 1% under discrete smoothness (simple consequence)\nUnder the same 1/m-type smoothness on [m,2m) with A<\u221e (hence L \u2265 \u03b1 m for \u03b1=(ln 2)/A\u2212\u03b5), Corollary 9 with \u03b7=0.98 and c=2 gives, on that plateau, joint (k,++) probability \u2265 (0.02\u2212O(1/L))\u00b70.5 for attaining ALG/OPT \u2264 2\u00b7B_I with B_I \u2264 2\u00b7C_bi(1 + 1/(\u03b1 e \u03b7)) + o(1). Mixing across [k0,2k0) by the plateau mass \u03b3 gives a global \u2265 0.01\u00b7\u03b3 \u2212 o(1) guarantee with an explicit constant, exactly as in Corollary 16.\n\nExamples and quick checks\n- If OPT(k\u22121)/OPT(k) \u2264 1 + (1/10m) for k\u2208[m,2m), then \u03b1\u2265 (ln 2)\u00b710 \u2248 6.93 > 1. Since L cannot exceed m by the window constraint, this means the dyadic drop cannot happen within [m,2m); hence the entire window is a single plateau (L\u2248m) and the per-plateau bound is O(1).\n- \u03c4\u2248(L\u22121)/e branch vs \u03c4=1: when L is large and m/L is moderate (say m/L \u2264 c), the new branch replaces (m ln L)/L with \u2248(2/e)(m/L) while the log term\u2019s coefficient is reduced by 1/e. Numerically, for L=10^6 and m/L=2, \u03c4=1 gives an O(m ln L/L) term \u2248 2\u00b7ln 10^6, while \u03c4\u2248(L\u22121)/e gives \u2248 (2/e)\u00b72 \u2248 1.47 in the tail, often improving the minimum.\n\nHeavy-coverage program (status and incremental step)\n- Conditional collision control revisited. Let H be k1 heavy optimal clusters; write S_H := \u2211_{P\u2208H} OPT1(P). For every t before heavy coverage completes, the per-step collision probability into a covered heavy cluster is p_t^{ch} = H_t(H_cov)/cost_t(X). Using the eH_t supermartingale, we have E[H_t(H_cov)] \u2264 5 S_H and hence E[p_t^{ch}] \u2264 E[5 S_H / cost_t(X)]. To turn this into a usable bound, we need a pathwise (or at least conditional-expectation) lower bound on cost_t(X) in terms of the uncovered heavy mass U_t(H); e.g., a persistence condition cost_t(X) \u2265 \u03b2\u00b7U_t(H). This remains the key missing link (as already noted in the verifier feedback). \n- Special-case metric separation (toward a fully rigorous lemma). Under the separation: for every heavy P and every y\u2209P, dist(\u00b5_P,y) \u2265 \u03bb\u00b7rad(P) with \u03bb\u226520 (rad^2(P) denotes average squared radius contributing to OPT1(P)), one can bound, for all t before covering P, \u2211_{x\u2208P} D_t(x)^2 \u2265 OPT1(P) (trivial) and show that the total D^2-mass outside all uncovered heavy clusters is at most a 1/\u0398(\u03bb^2) fraction of \u2211_{P\u2208H_uncovered} OPT1(P) plus a constant \u00b7\u2211_{Q\u2208H_cov} OPT1(Q). This implies p_t^H := Prob[next pick \u2208 uncovered heavy | F_t] \u2265 1 \u2212 O(1/\u03bb^2) \u2212 O(S_H / \u2211_{P\u2208H_uncovered} OPT1(P)). If heavy mass dominates light (scale separation), then the last term is negligible until near the end, yielding expected heavy-collisions O(k1/\u03bb^2). I will formalize this bound with explicit constants next, carefully isolating: (i) the geometric inequality that caps the outside mass per uncovered heavy cluster by \u2272 (1/\u03bb^2)\u00b7OPT1(P), and (ii) the use of eH_t to control covered-heavy contributions.\n\nNext steps (concrete, verifiable)\n- Curate the two new \u03c4-instantiations: (i) \u03c4=\u230aL/2\u230b and (ii) \u03c4=\u230a(L\u22121)/e\u230b, as explicit corollaries of Theorem 3 (proofs above). They extend the per-plateau min with constant-tail options.\n- Add the discrete-smoothness-to-length lemma and its corollary (1/m-type smoothness \u21d2 long plateau \u21d2 O(1) bound), to provide a clean structural condition guaranteeing improved averages or \u22651% probability guarantees.\n- Heavy coverage: Prove the \u201coutside mass\u201d geometric inequality rigorously under \u03bb-separation, completing the expected heavy-collision bound with explicit constants; then state a combined (\u03bb,R)-separation lemma converting into an O(log(1/\u03b5)) tail via bi-criteria oversampling of the light part.\n- Optional constants: If desired, tighten Corollary 12\u2019s K0 from 35 to 33 by re-auditing O(1/L) remainders in the pure-log branch; otherwise keep 35 for safety.\n"
