  "summary_md": "Round 0006 summary: Both provers audited output.md (no blocking correctness issues) and added multiple checkable corollaries and lemmas. Per-plateau: two new \u03c4-instantiations \u2014 balanced-split \u03c4=\u230aL/2\u230b and constant-tail \u03c4=\u230a(L\u22121)/e\u230b \u2014 with explicit safe constants producing midrange improvements and clean O(m/L) tails. Global mixing: a multi-plateau \u22651% probability corollary (P \u2265 0.01\u00b7\u03b3 \u2212 O(\u03b3/min_j L_j)) and a quantified O(log log k0) mixture for plateaus L_j \u2265 m_j/(ln k0)^\u03c3 giving a \u03b3-weighted term \u2248 2 C_bi (a+1+ln 2 + \u03c3 ln ln k0). Heavy-coverage: a rigorous expectation-form lemma bounds expected heavy-collisions by (\u03b1/(\u03b2+1))\u00b7k1\u00b7(S_H / inf_t U_t(H)), reducing the remaining task to proving persistence (a lower bound on uncovered heavy mass); provers propose to obtain this via \u03bb-separation, which would yield collisions O(k1/\u03bb^2). A discrete-smoothness \u21d2 long-plateau lemma ties per-step multiplicative smoothness to plateau length L \u2273 ln2/\u03b4, enabling the 1% mixing guarantee under mild smoothness. Verifier: partial success. Citations: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json.",

    "Balanced-split corollary (\u03c4=\u230aL/2\u230b): explicit bound giving a midrange option that replaces (m ln L)/L by a pure (m/L) tail up to constants.",
    "Constant-tail split (\u03c4\u2248(L\u22121)/e): explicit third branch with harmonic tail bounded by 2\u00b7(m/(e(L\u22121))) \u2014 a clean O(m/L) term with small constant.",
    "Multi-plateau mixing: for a family of long plateaus covering fraction \u03b3, joint (k,++) probability \u2265 0.01\u00b7\u03b3 \u2212 O(\u03b3/min_j L_j) that ALG/OPT \u2264 2\u00b7B_j on some plateau; B_j has explicit bounds (\u22482 C_bi(1+1/(\u03b1 e \u03b7))+O(1/L_j)).",
    "Quantified O(log log k0) mixture: if plateaus satisfy L_j \u2265 m_j/(ln k0)^\u03c3 and cover \u03b3 fraction, the global average is \u03b3\u00b7[2 C_bi(a+1+ln2+\u03c3 ln ln k0)] + (1\u2212\u03b3)\u00b7[K'+K'' ln(2k0)] + o(1).",

Discrete-smoothness lemma: if v_{k-1} \u2264 (1+\u03b4)v_k then factor-2 drop requires L \u2265 \u2308ln2/ln(1+\u03b4)\u2309 \u2265 \u2308(ln2)/\u03b4\u2309\u22121, so 1/m-type smoothness implies long plateaus and hence the mixing/probability guarantees."

    "Curate and add the two new \u03c4-instantiation corollaries (\u03c4=\u230aL/2\u230b and \u03c4=\u230a(L\u22121)/e\u230b), the multi-plateau \u22651% probability corollary, and the quantified O(log log k0) mixture to output.md with the explicit bounds and short checkable proofs.",
    "Formalize and prove the geometric \"outside mass\" inequality under \u03bb-separation with explicit constants; use it to derive a persistence lower bound inf_{t<\u03c4} U_t(H) \u2265 c\u00b7S_H (or quantify when it holds) and combine with the expectation lemma to obtain collision bounds (and then high-probability statements via concentration).",
    "Optional: re-audit small O(1/L) remainders and consider tightening safety constants (e.g., K0 reduction) once the geometric/persistence lemmas are formalized and constants propagated."
