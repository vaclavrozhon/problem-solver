Round 0006 — Audit, minor clarifications, and new, checkable additions (balanced split, multi-plateau probability, and a quantified O(log log k0) mixture)

Quick audit of output.md (minor points and clarifications)
- Absorbing small 1/L terms into constants. In Corollary 8 the step “absorb constants into K0 and the terms (ln m)/(L−1), (m/(L−1)) into K2(ln m)/L and K1(m ln L)/L” is sound when used as an upper envelope: for L≥2, (ln(2m))/(L−1) ≤ 2(ln m)/L + O(1), and a/(L−1) ≤ a, so additive O(1/L) pieces can be folded into K0. It may help to add a one-line remark justifying these two inequalities to prevent confusion.
- Third branch domain. The L≥3 restriction is now clearly stated in Corollaries 11–12 and a clarifying remark follows, which fixes the earlier edge case (ln ln 2<0).
- Endpoint term accounting. Lemma 1 bounds the aggregated endpoint term by ≤ ln(2k0), which is sufficient for all global combinations used later.
I see no correctness issues; below I add compact, checkable refinements that can be curated next.

New, checkable corollaries and remarks

1) Balanced-split corollary (mid-split τ=⌊L/2⌋) with safe constants (fills an intermediate regime)
- Statement. In the setting of Theorem 3 with L≥3 and τ:=⌊L/2⌋, for k uniform on I=[m,m+L),
  E_{k∈I} E_++[ALG/OPT]
  ≤ 2 C_bi [ (2/3)(a + 1 + ln(4m/(L−1))) + 1/2 + (m/(e(L−1)))(ln 3 + 1) ]
    + (C_fix(ln m + O(1)))/L,
  where a:=2+1/(2e).
- Proof sketch (checkable). For L≥3, uniformly: τ/(L−1) ≤ 2/3; (L−1−τ)/(L−1) ≤ 1/2; ln(2m/τ) ≤ ln(4m/(L−1)); and H_{L−2}−H_{τ−1} ≤ ln 3 + 1 (verify directly for L=3,4 and use monotonicity for larger L). Substitute these bounds into Theorem 3. 
- Why useful. This bounds the tail by a pure (m/L) term (up to constants), sometimes improving constants over both extremes and complementing the τ≈m/ln L branch. It can be recorded as an optional fourth candidate in the per-plateau minimum (min-of-four), or just cited as a remark for midrange L.

2) Multi-plateau 1% probability guarantee (global mixing over several long plateaus)
- Statement. Let J_long be a family of plateaus I_j=[m_j,m_j+L_j) with L_j ≥ α m_j, and suppose their total coverage is γ:= (1/k0)∑_{j∈J_long} L_j. Then, with η=0.98 and c=2 (as in Corollary 9),
  P_{k∼U([k0,2k0)),++}[ ALG_k/OPT_k ≤ 2·B_j for k∈I_j for some j∈J_long ]
  ≥ γ·(1−η−O(1/ min_j L_j))·(1−1/2) = 0.01·γ − O(γ/ min_j L_j),
  where for each j, B_j := 2 C_bi (1 + m_j/(e(T_j−1))) with T_j:=max{2,⌈η(L_j−1)⌉+1}, and hence B_j ≤ 2 C_bi (1 + 1/(α e η)) + O(1/L_j).
- Proof. Apply Corollary 9 on each I_j with the same (η,c), then average with weights L_j/k0. The minimum L_j controls the O(1/L_j) term in the product measure.
- Why useful. This extends Corollary 16 from “one long plateau” to “a union covering γ of the window,” yielding a clean ≥1%·γ joint probability with the same explicit constants.

3) Explicit O(log log k0) mixture under polylog-long plateaus (quantified and ready to aggregate)
- Statement (global average). Fix σ≥1. Let S be the set of plateaus I_j with L_j ≥ m_j/(ln k0)^σ, and suppose ∑_{j∈S} L_j ≥ γ k0. Then, for k uniform on [k0,2k0) and ++ randomness,
  E[ALG/OPT] ≤ γ·[ 2 C_bi (a+1+ln(2(ln k0)^σ)) ] + (1−γ)·[K′ + K″ ln(2k0)] + o(1)
  = γ·[ 2 C_bi (a+1+ln 2 + σ ln ln k0) ] + (1−γ)·[K′ + K″ ln(2k0)] + o(1).
- Proof. On each I_j∈S, Corollary 5 with α=1/(ln k0)^σ gives a per-plateau constant a+1+ln(2/α) = a+1+ln 2 + σ ln ln k0, up to o(1). Weight these by L_j/k0 and sum to get the γ term; bound the complement by Corollary 14. The endpoint terms aggregate to o(1) on S (since (ln m_j)/L_j ≤ σ ln ln k0/(ln k0)^σ) and to O(ln k0) on the complement (Lemma 1), which is absorbed into the (1−γ) term.
- Why useful. This is a precise, easy-to-use version of the informal “O(log log k0) on long plateaus” statement with explicit dependence on σ and γ and fully tied to existing corollaries.

Heavy-coverage program — a crisp conditional lemma (expectation form, with parameters explicit)
- Lemma (expected heavy-collision bound under persistence and covered-cost control). Let H be k1 optimal clusters designated “heavy,” and let S_H:=∑_{P∈H} OPT1(P). Define U_t(H) (uncovered heavy cost at step t), H_t(all) and U_t(L) as usual. Suppose up to the stopping time τ (when all heavy clusters become covered):
  (i) Persistence/dominance: U_t(H) ≥ β·(H_t(all) + U_t(L)) for all t<τ;
  (ii) Covered-heavy control in expectation: E[H_t(H)] ≤ α S_H for all t (α=5 suffices by the eH_t supermartingale and Lemma 4.1 of MRS).
  Then the expected number of heavy-collisions (selections in already-covered heavy clusters) before τ is at most (α/(β+1))·k1·(S_H/ inf_{t<τ} U_t(H)). In particular, if inf_{t<τ} U_t(H) ≥ S_H (a strong persistence), then E[collisions] ≤ (α/(β+1))·k1.
- Proof sketch (conditional and checkable). At step t, condition on the filtration. The collision probability into covered heavy is ≤ H_t(H)/cost_t(X) ≤ α S_H/(U_t(H)+H_t(all)+U_t(L)) ≤ α S_H/((β+1)U_t(H)) by (i). Sum this bound over at most k1 heavy hits (each heavy step either covers a new heavy cluster or collides) and use U_t(H) ≥ inf_{s<τ} U_s(H). Take expectations and apply (ii).
- Why useful. This isolates the coupon-collector-like collision control under explicit, testable parameters (β and the persistence lower bound). The remaining step is to prove persistence from scale or geometric separation (e.g., OPT_{k1} ≫ OPT_k), at least in expectation.
- Note on rigor. Unlike earlier sketches, this version avoids pathwise claims about eH_t; it uses the expectation control E[H_t(H)] ≤ 5 S_H and yields an expectation bound. High-probability control can then be pursued via Freedman’s inequality once a concentration statement for eH_t is established.

Examples and sanity checks
- Dyadic single plateau (L≈m). Corollary 5 gives E[ALG/OPT] ≤ 2 C_bi (a+1+ln 2) + o(1). With C_bi=5 and a≈2.183, this is ≤ 10·(3.183 + 0.693) + o(1) ≈ 38.8.
- Polylog-long plateaus. With σ=2 and γ=1/2, the global bound in item 3 reads E[ALG/OPT] ≤ 0.5·[const + 2 C_bi·2 ln ln k0] + 0.5·K″ ln(2k0) + o(1); thus the long-plateau half contributes O(ln ln k0) explicitly.
- Mid-split vs other branches. For L=m/20, the balanced split gives a tail ≈ (m/L)·const ≈ 20·const; the log branch gives ≈ ln(40) ≈ 3.69 up to constants; log dominates here (as expected). For L=m/ln m, the τ≈m/ln L branch yields ≈ (m/L)(1+ln ln L) ≈ ln m (1+ ln ln ln m), which is looser than the log branch’s ≈ ln(2 ln m); again, the min picks the right regime.

Next steps (concrete and verifiable)
1) Curate the balanced-split corollary into output.md (as an optional candidate alongside the three existing branches). It is a direct instantiation of Theorem 3 with uniform, easy-to-check inequalities.
2) Add the multi-plateau ≥1% probability corollary (item 2), which follows immediately from Corollary 9 by mixing; it generalizes Corollary 16.
3) Add the quantified O(log log k0) mixture (item 3) as a corollary under the polylog-long-plateau condition with parameters (σ,γ); this formalizes a recurring use-case with explicit constants.
4) Heavy-coverage: Try to prove a persistence bound inf_{t<τ} U_t(H) ≥ c·S_H and a β=Ω(1) dominance under a clean scale separation hypothesis, first in a simplified geometric regime (e.g., metric separation) and then from OPT_{k1} ≥ k^C·OPT_k; combine with the expectation lemma above. Work towards concentration of eH_t to upgrade to high probability.

Why this advances the program
- The balanced-split adds a simple, rigorous midrange option, improving constants in some regimes without increasing complexity.
- The multi-plateau probability and quantified O(log log k0) mixture turn earlier informal remarks into precise, ready-to-use global statements with explicit parameters and constants.
- The heavy-coverage conditional lemma is a clean step that avoids pathwise pitfalls and sets up the final task (proving persistence from scale/geometry separation) needed to harvest O(log(1/ε)) from oversampling of the light part.

Round 0006 — Small audits, two new τ-instantiations, a discrete-smoothness-to-long-plateaus lemma, and a clearer path for probability bounds

Audit of output.md (no blocking issues)
- Corollary 11/12: The “third branch only for L≥3” restriction is now clearly documented (Remark after Cor. 12). Good.
- Corollary 13 (global aggregation): The weights and treatment of L_j=1 via the fixed-k bound are correct. The endpoint sum cap (Lemma 1) is clean and used properly in Corollary 14.
- Corollary 16: The global ≥1% probability lower bound properly carries the plateau mass factor γ. Constants are explicit.
No correctness errors spotted. The additions below are meant to tighten the per-plateau envelope with simple, checkable instantiations and to connect “discrete smoothness” of OPT(·) to long plateaus.

New, checkable per-plateau corollaries (to add after Corollary 10)
1) Balanced-split with hard constants (τ = ⌊L/2⌋)
Statement. In Theorem 3, for L≥3 and τ:=⌊L/2⌋, for k uniform on I=[m,m+L):
E_{k∈I} E_++[ALG/OPT] ≤ 2·C_bi [ (2/3)(a+1+ln(4m/(L−1))) + 1/2 + (m/(e(L−1)))(ln 3 + 1) ] + (C_fix(ln m + O(1)))/L,
with a:=2+1/(2e).
Justification (fully checkable): For L≥3 and τ=⌊L/2⌋ we have τ/(L−1) ≤ 2/3; (L−1−τ)/(L−1) ≤ 1/2; ln(2m/τ) ≤ ln(4m/(L−1)); and H_{L−2}−H_{τ−1} ≤ ln 3 + 1 (verify small-L cases directly). Substitute these bounds into Theorem 3. Why useful. This removes the ln L factor in the harmonic tail, replacing (m ln L)/L by a pure (m/L) term at the expense of a larger constant on the logarithmic piece. It can be tighter than both existing extremes in midrange regimes.

2) Constant-tail split (τ ≈ (L−1)/e)
Statement. In Theorem 3, for L≥3 and τ:=⌊(L−1)/e⌋ ≥ 1,
E_{k∈I} E_++[ALG/OPT] ≤ 2·C_bi [ (1/e)(a+1+ln(2em/(L−1))) + (1−1/e) + (m/(e(L−1)))·2 ] + (C_fix(ln m + O(1)))/L.
Justification. With τ≈(L−1)/e, we have τ/(L−1) ≤ 1/e and (L−1−τ)/(L−1) ≤ 1−1/e. For the harmonic tail, H_{L−2}−H_{τ−1} ≤ ln((L−1)/(τ))+1 ≤ ln e + 1 = 2. Finally ln(2m/τ) ≤ ln(2em/(L−1)). Substitute into Theorem 3. Why useful. This gives a third, fully explicit branch with a constant harmonic tail contribution 2·(m/(e(L−1))), i.e., a clean O(m/L) tail with a small constant, and a logarithmic piece whose coefficient is 1/e of that in the pure-log term. It sometimes improves over τ=1 for moderate L when ln L is not small but m/L is.

Remarks on regime selection (min-of-five)
- The per-plateau min may be extended to five branches: τ∈{L−1, 1, ⌊m/ln L⌋, ⌊L/2⌋, ⌊(L−1)/e⌋}. All are explicit and easy to verify. A practical recommendation is to keep the three already curated (pure-log, τ=1, τ=⌊m/ln L⌋) and optionally add the constant-tail split τ≈(L−1)/e when one wants a clean O(m/L) tail with a smaller constant than in the τ=1 branch; the balanced-split can be listed as an optional midrange tightening.

Discrete smoothness ⇒ long plateaus: a simple structural lemma
Lemma (discrete-smoothness-to-length). Let (v_k)_{k≥1} be a nonincreasing positive sequence. Suppose on an interval [m, m+L) we have for some δ∈(0,1): for all k∈{m+1,…,m+L−1}, v_{k−1} ≤ (1+δ) v_k. Then any factor-2 drop of v_k over that interval requires L ≥ ⌈ln 2 / ln(1+δ)⌉ ≥ ⌈(ln 2)/δ⌉ − 1.
Proof. For t steps, the total multiplicative drop is at most (1+δ)^t. To drop by 2 we need (1+δ)^t ≥ 2 ⇒ t ≥ ln 2 / ln(1+δ). Since ln(1+δ) ≤ δ, t ≥ (ln 2)/δ. Thus, the length L of a factor-2 plateau must satisfy L−1 ≥ t, giving the displayed bound.
Corollary (long plateau from 1/m-type smoothness). If for all k in [m,2m) we have v_{k−1} ≤ (1 + A/m) v_k with some absolute A>0, then any factor-2 drop within [m,2m) requires L ≥ c_A·m for c_A:= (ln 2)/A − o(1). In particular, L ≥ α m for α:= (ln 2)/A − ε once m is large, hence Corollary 5 applies and the plateau contributes O_α(1) to the average.
Why useful here. Instantiating v_k := OPT(k), this gives a simple, checkable surrogate for “long plateaus”: if the discrete per-step multiplicative decay OPT(k−1)/OPT(k) is at most (1+A/m) on [m,2m), then the corresponding dyadic-scale plateau inside that window is long (L ≳ m), yielding a constant per-plateau bound and, if such windows occupy a γ-fraction of [k0,2k0), a global mixture bound of the form Corollary 15. This isolates a data-agnostic regularity condition that implies the beneficial “oversampling by randomizing k.”

Probability ≥ 1% under discrete smoothness (simple consequence)
Under the same 1/m-type smoothness on [m,2m) with A<∞ (hence L ≥ α m for α=(ln 2)/A−ε), Corollary 9 with η=0.98 and c=2 gives, on that plateau, joint (k,++) probability ≥ (0.02−O(1/L))·0.5 for attaining ALG/OPT ≤ 2·B_I with B_I ≤ 2·C_bi(1 + 1/(α e η)) + o(1). Mixing across [k0,2k0) by the plateau mass γ gives a global ≥ 0.01·γ − o(1) guarantee with an explicit constant, exactly as in Corollary 16.

Examples and quick checks
- If OPT(k−1)/OPT(k) ≤ 1 + (1/10m) for k∈[m,2m), then α≥ (ln 2)·10 ≈ 6.93 > 1. Since L cannot exceed m by the window constraint, this means the dyadic drop cannot happen within [m,2m); hence the entire window is a single plateau (L≈m) and the per-plateau bound is O(1).
- τ≈(L−1)/e branch vs τ=1: when L is large and m/L is moderate (say m/L ≤ c), the new branch replaces (m ln L)/L with ≈(2/e)(m/L) while the log term’s coefficient is reduced by 1/e. Numerically, for L=10^6 and m/L=2, τ=1 gives an O(m ln L/L) term ≈ 2·ln 10^6, while τ≈(L−1)/e gives ≈ (2/e)·2 ≈ 1.47 in the tail, often improving the minimum.

Heavy-coverage program (status and incremental step)
- Conditional collision control revisited. Let H be k1 heavy optimal clusters; write S_H := ∑_{P∈H} OPT1(P). For every t before heavy coverage completes, the per-step collision probability into a covered heavy cluster is p_t^{ch} = H_t(H_cov)/cost_t(X). Using the eH_t supermartingale, we have E[H_t(H_cov)] ≤ 5 S_H and hence E[p_t^{ch}] ≤ E[5 S_H / cost_t(X)]. To turn this into a usable bound, we need a pathwise (or at least conditional-expectation) lower bound on cost_t(X) in terms of the uncovered heavy mass U_t(H); e.g., a persistence condition cost_t(X) ≥ β·U_t(H). This remains the key missing link (as already noted in the verifier feedback). 
- Special-case metric separation (toward a fully rigorous lemma). Under the separation: for every heavy P and every y∉P, dist(µ_P,y) ≥ λ·rad(P) with λ≥20 (rad^2(P) denotes average squared radius contributing to OPT1(P)), one can bound, for all t before covering P, ∑_{x∈P} D_t(x)^2 ≥ OPT1(P) (trivial) and show that the total D^2-mass outside all uncovered heavy clusters is at most a 1/Θ(λ^2) fraction of ∑_{P∈H_uncovered} OPT1(P) plus a constant ·∑_{Q∈H_cov} OPT1(Q). This implies p_t^H := Prob[next pick ∈ uncovered heavy | F_t] ≥ 1 − O(1/λ^2) − O(S_H / ∑_{P∈H_uncovered} OPT1(P)). If heavy mass dominates light (scale separation), then the last term is negligible until near the end, yielding expected heavy-collisions O(k1/λ^2). I will formalize this bound with explicit constants next, carefully isolating: (i) the geometric inequality that caps the outside mass per uncovered heavy cluster by ≲ (1/λ^2)·OPT1(P), and (ii) the use of eH_t to control covered-heavy contributions.

Next steps (concrete, verifiable)
- Curate the two new τ-instantiations: (i) τ=⌊L/2⌋ and (ii) τ=⌊(L−1)/e⌋, as explicit corollaries of Theorem 3 (proofs above). They extend the per-plateau min with constant-tail options.
- Add the discrete-smoothness-to-length lemma and its corollary (1/m-type smoothness ⇒ long plateau ⇒ O(1) bound), to provide a clean structural condition guaranteeing improved averages or ≥1% probability guarantees.
- Heavy coverage: Prove the “outside mass” geometric inequality rigorously under λ-separation, completing the expected heavy-collision bound with explicit constants; then state a combined (λ,R)-separation lemma converting into an O(log(1/ε)) tail via bi-criteria oversampling of the light part.
- Optional constants: If desired, tighten Corollary 12’s K0 from 35 to 33 by re-auditing O(1/L) remainders in the pure-log branch; otherwise keep 35 for safety.
