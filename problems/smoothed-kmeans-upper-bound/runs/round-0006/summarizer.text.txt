{"summary_md":"Round 0006 summary: Both provers audited output.md (no blocking correctness issues) and added multiple checkable corollaries and lemmas. Per-plateau: two new τ-instantiations — balanced-split τ=⌊L/2⌋ and constant-tail τ=⌊(L−1)/e⌋ — with explicit safe constants producing midrange improvements and clean O(m/L) tails. Global mixing: a multi-plateau ≥1% probability corollary (P ≥ 0.01·γ − O(γ/min_j L_j)) and a quantified O(log log k0) mixture for plateaus L_j ≥ m_j/(ln k0)^σ giving a γ-weighted term ≈ 2 C_bi (a+1+ln 2 + σ ln ln k0). Heavy-coverage: a rigorous expectation-form lemma bounds expected heavy-collisions by (α/(β+1))·k1·(S_H / inf_t U_t(H)), reducing the remaining task to proving persistence (a lower bound on uncovered heavy mass); provers propose to obtain this via λ-separation, which would yield collisions O(k1/λ^2). A discrete-smoothness ⇒ long-plateau lemma ties per-step multiplicative smoothness to plateau length L ≳ ln2/δ, enabling the 1% mixing guarantee under mild smoothness. Verifier: partial success.
