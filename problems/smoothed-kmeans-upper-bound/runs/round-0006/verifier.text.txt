{"feedback_md":"High-level audit and triage\n- Balanced split (τ=⌊L/2⌋). Both provers’ instantiations are correct and align with the safe template we had in notes. The key inequalities are all valid for L≥3: τ/(L−1)≤2/3, (L−1−τ)/(L−1)≤1/2, ln(2m/τ)≤ln(4m/(L−1)), and H_{L−2}−H_{τ−1}≤ln 3+1 (small-L cases verifiable directly). This is a clean, checkable branch that converts the tail to O(m/L) with explicit constants. This is worth curating into output.md as a separate corollary and can be considered as an optional fourth candidate in the per-plateau minimum.\n\n- “Constant-tail” split (τ≈(L−1)/e). The idea is attractive, but the concrete constants in Prover 02’s writeup are not uniformly valid. In particular, with τ=⌊(L−1)/e⌋, the claim H_{L−2}−H_{τ−1}≤2 fails at L=6 (indeed H_4≈2.083>2). A rigorous statement needs either (i) a domain restriction (e.g., give bounds as functions of L with an explicit 1+ln((L−1)/τ) tail, or state a safe absolute bound such as ≤3 or ≤4 for L≥4), or (ii) keep the bound as 1+ln((L−1)/τ) without collapsing to a universal constant. Also, τ=⌊(L−1)/e⌋≥1 only for L≥4 (for L=3 it is 0). If we keep this branch, we should state L≥4 and adjust constants accordingly. Given the balanced-split already yields a tidy O(m/L) tail with a small constant, I recommend not adding the τ≈(L−1)/e branch to output.md until constants are fully repaired.\n\n- Multi-plateau 1% probability (mixing). Prover 01’s extension from a single long plateau to a disjoint union covering γ of the window is correct. The remainder term aggregates as O(γ/min_j L_j) (since ∑_j(L_j/k0)·O(1/L_j)=O(|J|/k0) and |J|≤γ k0/min L_j). This is a straightforward corollary of our Corollary 9 and should be added to output.md with an explicit statement.\n\n- Quantified O(log log k0) mixture (polylog-long plateaus). The core idea is sound, and the constants track cleanly from Corollary 5 with α=1/(ln k0)^σ: on each such plateau, the per-plateau bound is 2C_bi(a+1+ln 2+σ ln ln k0)+o(1). One technical correction: the endpoint term justification in the prover text is off; the correct aggregation yields (C_fix/k0)∑_{j∈S} ln m_j≤C_fix·|S|·ln(2k0)/k0=O(γ (ln k0)^σ ln k0/k0)=o(1) since |S|≤γ k0/min L_j and min L_j≥k0/(ln k0)^σ. This can be stated cleanly in output.md as a global corollary.\n\n- Discrete smoothness ⇒ long plateaus. The lemma is right in spirit but needs precise rounding: from v_{k−1}≤(1+δ)v_k one gets that a factor-2 drop over t steps requires t≥ln 2/ln(1+δ). Since a window [m,m+L) has L−1 steps, the correct condition is L≥1+⌈ln 2/ln(1+δ)⌉. For δ=A/m on [m,2m), this implies L≥1+⌈(ln 2)·m/A⌉; if A<ln 2, then the dyadic drop cannot occur within the window and the entire window is a (single) plateau of length m. This is a useful structural lemma to include in output.md (as Lemma 2) with the corrected constants, together with the 1/m-type smoothness corollary.\n\n- Heavy-coverage program. The conditional “expected collision” lemma proposed by Prover 01 is not yet rigorous. The step that substitutes H_t(H) by α·S_H in the numerator inside a conditional probability is a ratio-of-expectations pitfall; one must keep p_t^{ch}=H_t(H_cov)/cost_t(all) conditioned on the filtration and either (a) obtain a deterministic lower bound on cost_t(all) in terms of U_t(H) (or a conditional one with high probability), and (b) control H_t(H_cov) pathwise or via concentration (e.g., using a supermartingale and Freedman). Summing a per-step bound “over at most k1 heavy hits” also needs justification: the sum of collision probabilities is over all steps before τ, not only those when a heavy point is sampled. The right approach is to sum E[p_t^{ch}|F_t] across t<τ, then bound the sum by integrating conditional expectations with proper denominators. I recommend: first prove a persistence inequality cost_t(all)≥(β+1)U_t(H) deterministically under a geometric separation hypothesis, derive a clean bound for ∑_{t<τ} E[p_t^{ch}|F_t], and only then bring in (super)martingale tools for concentration.\n\nActionable next steps\n1) Add the balanced-split corollary to output.md (as an optional branch alongside existing ones).\n2) Add the multi-plateau 1% probability mixing corollary (with explicit γ, α, η=0.98, c=2) to output.md.\n3) Add the quantified O(log log k0) mixture corollary for plateaus with L≥m/(ln k0)^σ to output.md, with a fully explicit o(1) remainder as above.\n4) Include the discrete-smoothness ⇒ long plateaus lemma (with the corrected off-by-one and a two-case corollary for A≥ln 2 and A<ln 2).\n5) For the τ≈(L−1)/e branch, either fix constants rigorously (domain L≥4 and a safe tail constant), or defer inclusion.\n6) Heavy coverage: target a rigorous denominator lower bound (persistence) under an explicit separation; only then attempt expected-collisions and Freedman for high probability.\n","new_notes_md":"Round 0006 updates: audits, fixes, and new curated directions\n\n1) Balanced split (τ=⌊L/2⌋) is safe and useful\n- For L≥3 and τ=⌊L/2⌋ we have the uniform bounds: τ/(L−1)≤2/3, (L−1−τ)/(L−1)≤1/2, ln(2m/τ)≤ln(4m/(L−1)), and H_{L−2}−H_{τ−1}≤ln 3+1 (check L=3,4 directly; for larger L use H_n−H_m≤ln((n+1)/(m+1))≤ln 3).

A rigorous statement should either (i) retain the form H_{L−2}−H_{τ−1}≤1+ln((L−1)/τ), or (ii) give a safe constant (e.g., ≤3 or ≤4) uniformly for L≥4.

The o(1) comes from endpoint terms: their contribution over S is (C_fix/k0)∑_{j∈S} ln m_j ≤ C_fix·|S|·ln(2k0)/k0 = O(γ (ln k0)^σ ln k0/k0)→0, since |S|≤(γ k0)/min_j L_j and min_j L_j≥k0/(ln k0)^σ. We will curate a precise corollary to output.md.\n\n5) Discrete smoothness ⇒ long plateaus (corrected rounding)\n- Lemma (sequence form). If (v_k) is nonincreasing and for all k in {m+1,…,m+L−1} we have v_{k−1}≤(1+δ) v_k, then v_{m+L−1}≥v_m/(1+δ)^{L−1}. Hence a factor-2 drop within [m,m+L) requires L≥1+⌈ln 2/ln(1+δ)⌉. Using ln(1+δ)≤δ, it suffices that L≥1+⌈(ln 2)/δ⌉.\n- Corollary (1/m-type smoothness on [m,2m)). If v_{k−1}≤(1+A/m) v_k for all k∈[m+1,2m−1], then any factor-2 drop within [m,2m) requires L≥1+⌈(ln 2) m/A⌉. Thus: if A≥ln 2, then L≥((ln 2)/A)·m up to lower-order terms; if A<ln 2, then a factor-2 drop cannot occur within the window, so the whole [m,2m) is one plateau (L=m). This cleanly connects “discrete smoothness” to long plateaus.\n\n6) Heavy-coverage program: rigor requirements\n- To bound the expected number of heavy-collisions, one must avoid ratio-of-expectations. Work with p_t^{ch}=cost_t(covered heavy)/cost_t(all) conditioned on the filtration. A usable inequality is p_t^{ch}≤H_t(H_cov)/((β+1)U_t(H)) once we have a deterministic persistence bound cost_t(all)≥(β+1)U_t(H). Then ∑_{t<τ}E[p_t^{ch}|F_t]≤(1/(β+1))·∑_{t<τ}E[H_t(H_cov)/U_t(H)], which still needs (a) a deterministic or high-prob lower bound on U_t(H) until τ, and (b) control of H_t(H_cov) (e.g., via a supermartingale with concentration). These should be established under explicit separation assumptions before drawing collision bounds.\n\nNext steps\n- Curate to output.md: (i) balanced split corollary; (ii) multi-plateau 1% mixing; (iii) quantified O(log log k0) mixture; (iv) discrete-smoothness lemma and corollary.\n- Either repair or defer the τ≈(L−1)/e branch.\n- For heavy coverage: prove a persistence inequality cost_t(all)≥(β+1)U_t(H) under a clean separation hypothesis; then bound expected collisions; then lift to high probability via Freedman.\n","new_notes_append":"True","new_outputs_md":"Corollary 17 (Balanced split τ=⌊L/2⌋: an O(m/L) tail with explicit constants).\nLet I=[m,m+L) be a factor-2 plateau with L≥3.

For any such k, Markov gives P_{++}[ALG_k/OPT_k ≤ c·B_j]≥1−1/c. Weighting by L_j/k0 and summing over j∈J produces the stated lower bound.
