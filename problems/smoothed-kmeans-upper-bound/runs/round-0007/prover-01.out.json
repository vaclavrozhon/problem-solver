  "progress_md": "Round 0007 \u2014 New probability guarantees (two-level Markov), explicit global constants, and audit notes\n\nSummary\n- I propose a simple, unconditional probability bound that holds on the whole window [k0,2k0): a two-level Markov argument yields a constant-mass guarantee that ALG/OPT is O(log k0) with explicit constants. This meets the \u201c\u22650.01 probability\u201d alternative formulation and is stronger (gives \u226525% mass) without any structural assumptions on OPT(\u00b7).\n- I also instantiate the resulting threshold explicitly when C_bi=C_fix=5, giving a clean numeric bound. The proof only uses the already curated plateau average bounds (Corollary 11/12) and Markov\u2019s inequality.\n- Minor audit: I see no correctness issues in output.md. I point out one easy-to-curate addition (the two-level Markov corollary) and provide all steps and constants needed.\n\nIdea \u2014 Two-level Markov to get constant joint (k,++) probability\n- Setting. For each maximal factor-2 plateau I_j=[m_j,m_j+L_j) with L_j\u22652, let\n  B_j := K0 + K1\u00b7min{ ln^+(2m_j/(L_j\u22121)), (m_j ln L_j)/L_j, (m_j(1+ln ln L_j))/L_j } + K2\u00b7(ln m_j)/L_j\n  be the per-plateau envelope from Corollary 11. For L_j=1, use the fixed-k bound D_j := C_fix(ln m_j+O(1)). Let\n  B_max := max{ max_{j:L_j\u22652} B_j,  max_{j:L_j=1} D_j }.\n- Two-level Markov (plateau-agnostic). For each k in [k0,2k0), define Y_k := E_++[ALG_k/OPT_k | k]. From Corollary 11 and the fixed-k bound, Y_k \u2264 B_{plateau(k)} \u2264 B_max. Then for any c\u22651:\n  1) Over k, Markov gives P_k[Y_k \u2264 c\u00b7B_max] \u2265 1 \u2212 1/c.\n  2) Conditional on any such k, Markov over ++ gives P_{++}[ ALG_k/OPT_k \u2264 c\u00b7Y_k ] \u2265 1 \u2212 1/c.\n  Combining and using c\u00b7Y_k \u2264 c\u00b7(c\u00b7B_max) = c^2\u00b7B_max yields the joint bound\n  P_{k,++}[ ALG_k/OPT_k \u2264 c^2 \u00b7 B_max ] \u2265 (1 \u2212 1/c)^2.\n- Consequence (take c=2). With probability at least 1/4 over the joint (k,++) randomness,\n  ALG_k/OPT_k \u2264 4\u00b7B_max.\n- This requires no structural conditions on OPT(\u00b7) (no long plateaus, etc.) and directly addresses the alternative task statement (probability \u2265 0.01) with \u2265 0.25.\n\nExplicit global bound on B_max\n- For L_j\u22652, min{\u00b7} \u2264 ln^+(2m_j/(L_j\u22121)) \u2264 ln(2\u00b7(2k0)/1) = ln(4k0), and (ln m_j)/L_j \u2264 (ln(2k0))/2. Hence for L_j\u22652,\n  B_j \u2264 K0 + K1\u00b7ln(4k0) + (K2/2)\u00b7ln(2k0).\n- For L_j=1, D_j \u2264 C_fix(ln(2k0)+O(1)). Thus\n  B_max \u2264 max{ K0 + K1\u00b7ln(4k0) + (K2/2)\u00b7ln(2k0),  C_fix(ln(2k0)+O(1)) }.\n- Instantiation when C_bi=C_fix=5 and K0=35, K1=10, K2=5 (from Corollary 12):\n  \u2022 L_j\u22652: 35 + 10\u00b7ln(4k0) + (5/2)\u00b7ln(2k0) = 35 + 10 ln 4 + 2.5 ln 2 + 12.5 ln k0 \u2248 50.6 + 12.5 ln k0.\n  \u2022 L_j=1: 5(ln(2k0)+O(1)) \u2264 10 + 5 ln(2k0).\n  For k0 large, the first dominates; a safe uniform bound is\n    B_max \u2264 45 + 12.5\u00b7ln(2k0)   (conservative; absorbs the O(1) from the L=1 case).\n\nNew corollary (proposed for output.md): Unconditional \u226525% probability bound\n- Statement. For k uniform on [k0,2k0) and k-means++ randomness, and with B_max as above,\n  P[ ALG_k/OPT_k \u2264 4\u00b7B_max ] \u2265 1/4.\n  In particular, if C_bi=C_fix=5, then for all k0\u22652,\n  P[ ALG_k/OPT_k \u2264 4(45 + 12.5\u00b7ln(2k0)) ] \u2265 1/4,\n  i.e., P[ ALG_k/OPT_k \u2264 180 + 50\u00b7ln(2k0) ] \u2265 1/4.\n- Proof. Immediate from the two-level Markov argument with c=2 and the bound on B_max above. (For small k0 the additive constants can be slightly tightened; the stated numbers are conservative and uniform.)\n- Parametric variant. For any c\u22651,\n  P[ ALG_k/OPT_k \u2264 c^2\u00b7B_max ] \u2265 (1 \u2212 1/c)^2.\n  This yields a continuum of tradeoffs; e.g., c=10 gives probability \u22650.81 for a threshold 100\u00b7B_max.\n\nWhy this is useful\n- It gives a clean, structure-free probability guarantee for the alternative task goal (\u201cbound attained with probability \u22650.01\u201d), actually with 25% mass and explicit O(log k0) thresholds.\n- It complements Corollary 16/18 (which give stronger constants on long plateaus) by providing a baseline bound even when no plateau is long.\n- It is derived entirely from existing curated statements (Corollary 11/12 and the fixed\u2011k bound), and thus is easy to verify and insert.\n\nExamples and sanity checks\n- Worst-case short plateaus (L_j=1 for almost all j): B_max is governed by the fixed-k term 5(ln(2k0)+O(1)), hence the corollary still yields an O(log k0) threshold at \u226525% mass.\n- Single long plateau (L\u2248m): B_max is O(1) (Corollary 5), so the same two-level Markov gives an O(1) threshold with \u226525% mass, consistent with Corollary 16\u2019s stronger constants for \u22651% mass.\n\nMinor audit of output.md (this round)\n- The min-of-three per-plateau bound (Corollary 11) and its explicit-constant instantiation (Corollary 12) are correctly stated, including the L\u22653 caveat for the third branch.\n- Global aggregation (Corollary 13), unconditional O(log k0) (Corollary 14), long-plateau mixture (Corollary 15), and multi-plateau probability (Corollary 18) are coherent. Endpoint-sum control (Lemma 1) is clean and used properly. I see no correctness issues.\n\nNext steps (curation-ready)\n1) Add the \u201cTwo-level Markov\u201d corollary above to output.md (plateau-agnostic \u226525% probability bound), with the parametric c\u22651 version. Include the explicit numeric instantiation for C_bi=C_fix=5.\n2) Optionally note (as a remark) that for any target probability p\u2208(0,1), choosing c=(1\u2212\u221ap)^{-1} gives P\u2265p at threshold c^2\u00b7B_max, making the tradeoff explicit.\n3) If desired, very slightly tighten the numeric constant in B_max (e.g., B_max \u2264 42 + 12.5 ln(2k0) as argued in-line); the current 45 + 12.5 ln(2k0) statement is safe and simple.\n\nObstacles and open items\n- Heavy coverage under scale separation: the key \u201cpersistence\u201d denominator (cost_t(all) \u2265 (\u03b2+1)\u00b7U_t(H) before heavy coverage completes) remains to be established under clean separation hypotheses. Once proved, the expected-collisions bound can follow by summing conditional probabilities; then Freedman\u2019s inequality can lift to high probability.\n- Lower bounds under random-k smoothing: constructing a single dataset producing \u03a9(log k0) average (or comparable \u2265p probability) across the entire window remains open; existing fixed\u2011k lower bounds depend on k.\n"
