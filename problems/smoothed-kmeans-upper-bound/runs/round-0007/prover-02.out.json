  "progress_md": "Round 0007 \u2014 Audit, new structural corollaries, and probability refinements\n\nOverview and quick audit of output.md\n- The current file is coherent and self-contained for the plateau calculus. The new branches (\u03c4=\u230am/ln L\u230b, balanced split \u03c4=\u230aL/2\u230b), the global min-of-three envelope, and the multi-plateau probability mixing are all correctly stated with safe constants. I see no blocking correctness errors.\n- Small opportunity: Corollary 9 already yields a family of quantile/probability statements for any \u03b7\u2208(0,1). It may be valuable to explicitly record the \u201cmedian\u201d instantiation (\u03b7=1/2) yielding a 25% plateau-level probability, alongside the existing 1% instantiation, for ease of use.\n\nNew, checkable additions (proposed to curate)\n\n1) Power-law profile corollary (constant average and explicit constants)\n- Statement. Suppose on a window [m,2m) we have \n  OPT_k \u2208 [C_1 k^{\u2212p}, C_2 k^{\u2212p}] for some p>0 and constants C_1,C_2>0.\n  Then the maximal factor-2 plateau I\u2286[m,2m) starting at m has length L\u2265(2^{1/p}\u22121)m and hence, by Corollary 5, for k uniform on I,\n  E_{k\u2208I} E_++[ALG/OPT] \u2264 2 C_bi (a+1+ln(2/\u03b1)) + o(1), with \u03b1:=2^{1/p}\u22121 and a:=2+1/(2e).\n  Consequently, averaging over [m,2m) yields a constant bound depending only on p and C_bi, uniformly for large m.\n- Proof sketch (checkable). For k\u2208[m, m+L), OPT_{m+L} \u2265 OPT_m/2 is equivalent to ((m+L)/m)^p \u2264 2, i.e., L \u2264 (2^{1/p}\u22121)m. Hence the factor-2 plateau starting at m has length at least \u03b1 m with \u03b1=2^{1/p}\u22121. Apply Corollary 5 with this \u03b1 and note the endpoint term is o(1) as L\u2192\u221e.\n- Why useful. Captures a broad and natural regime (polynomial decay) where random-k smoothing gives a constant bound with explicit dependence on p. This can be turned into explicit numeric constants by plugging C_bi (e.g., 5) and p (examples below).\n- Example. For p=1 and C_bi=5, \u03b1=1 and the plateau average is \u2264 10(3+1/(2e)+ln 2)+o(1) \u2248 38.8.\n\n2) Median (25%) plateau-level probability guarantee (simple instantiation of Corollary 9)\n- Statement. In Corollary 9, choosing \u03b7=1/2 and c=2 yields, for k uniform over any plateau I=[m,m+L) with L\u22652,\n  P_{k,++}[ ALG/OPT \u2264 2\u00b7B_I ] \u2265 (1\u22121/2\u2212O(1/L))\u00b7(1\u22121/2) = 1/4 \u2212 O(1/L),\n  where B_I = 2 C_bi (1 + m/(e(T\u22121))) and T = max{2, \u2308(L\u22121)/2\u2309+1}. If L \u2265 \u03b1 m, then B_I \u2264 2 C_bi (1 + 2/(\u03b1 e)) + O(1/L).\n- Why useful. Complements the 1% probability remark with a clean, stronger (\u224825%) option under the same framework; particularly handy when downstream needs favor a larger success probability, albeit with a larger constant than one might get by tuning \u03b7.\n\n3) Discrete 1/k-smoothness across the window \u21d2 O_A(1) average (global structural corollary)\n- Hypothesis. Suppose for all k\u2208[k0,2k0) we have\n  ln(OPT_{k\u22121}/OPT_k) \u2264 A/k\n  for some A>0. (Equivalently, OPT_{k\u22121} \u2264 (1 + A/k) OPT_k.)\n- Lemma (plateau length and count). On any factor-2 plateau starting at m within the window, the length satisfies L \u2265 (ln 2)\u00b7m/A (by Lemma 2 with \u03b4=A/m). Moreover, the starting indices m_j of consecutive plateaus grow multiplicatively by at least (1 + (ln 2)/A). Hence the number of plateaus J across [k0,2k0) is at most \u2308 ln 2 / ln(1 + (ln 2)/A) \u2309 \u2264 \u2308 (1 + (ln 2)/A)\u00b7A/ln 2 \u2309 = O(A).\n  A safe bound is J \u2264 \u2308 (A + ln 2)/ln 2 \u2309.\n- Corollary (global average). Applying Corollary 5 on each plateau and Corollary 13 for aggregation,\n  E_{k\u223cU([k0,2k0)),++}[ALG/OPT]\n  \u2264 2 C_bi (a+1+ln(2/\u03b1)) + (C_fix/k0)\u2211_{j=1}^{J} ln m_j,\n  with \u03b1=(ln 2)/A. Since J=O(A) and m_j\u22642k0, the endpoint term is \u2264 C_fix\u00b7J\u00b7ln(2k0)/k0 = o(1). Therefore,\n  E[ALG/OPT] \u2264 2 C_bi (a+1+ln(2A/ln 2)) + o(1),\n  i.e., an O_A(1) bound uniformly over the window for large k0.\n- Proof sketch (checkable). The length bound is Lemma 2 with \u03b4=A/m. For the count, m_{j+1} \u2265 m_j + (ln 2)m_j/A = (1 + (ln 2)/A)m_j; iterating till we exceed 2k0 gives the stated J bound. Aggregation then applies Corollary 5 per plateau and shows the endpoint-sum is negligible because J\u226ak0.\n- Why useful. This supplies a transparent, data-agnostic smoothness condition that forces long plateaus throughout the window and yields a global O(1) average (as a function of A), sharpening the unconditional O(log k0) bound under a verifiable regularity premise.\n\n4) Global mixture corollary from power-law or 1/k-smoothness (explicit probability)\n- If the entire window [k0,2k0) satisfies the power-law or 1/k-smoothness hypotheses (items 1\u20133), then \u03b3=1 in Corollary 16 and in the \u201c25%\u201d remark above. Consequently,\n  P_{k,++}[ ALG/OPT \u2264 2\u00b7B_I ] \u2265 1/4 \u2212 o(1),\n  with B_I \u2264 2 C_bi (1 + const) depending only on p (power law) or A (smoothness). This offers a straightforward probability \u2265 0.25 guarantee meeting the alternative task objective with fully explicit constants.\n\nWhy these additions are useful here\n- They convert common, checkable structural properties of OPT(\u00b7) (polynomial decay; bounded discrete derivative) into clean, global O(1) averages and explicit constant-probability statements, strengthening the \u201cwhy randomizing k helps\u201d narrative beyond single-plateau assumptions.\n- All statements are direct instantiations of existing machinery (Lemma 2, Corollary 5, Corollary 9, Corollary 13) and require only short algebraic verifications.\n\nExamples and sanity checks\n- Power-law p=1. On [m,2m), \u03b1=1; by item 1 with C_bi=5, the plateau average is \u2264 10(3+1/(2e)+ln 2)+o(1) \u2248 38.8; by item 2 with \u03b1=1, B_I \u2264 2\u00b75\u00b7(1+2/e) \u2248 18.7, giving a 25% probability threshold \u2264 37.4.\n- Smoothness A=2. Then \u03b1=(ln 2)/2\u22480.346; the global average is \u2264 2 C_bi (a+1+ln(2A/ln 2)) + o(1) \u2248 10(3+1/(2e)+ln(2\u00b72/ln 2)) \u2248 10(3.183 + 1.060) \u2248 42.4 (with C_bi=5), plus o(1).\n\nObstacles and gaps\n- Heavy-coverage program. The main missing piece remains a rigorous persistence denominator: a deterministic or high-probability lower bound of the form cost_t(all) \u2265 (\u03b2+1)\u00b7U_t(H) prior to covering all heavy clusters, derivable from a clean separation hypothesis. Once established, summing conditional collision probabilities becomes straightforward.\n- Constants for the median probability. The \u03b7=1/2 choice is general but not constant-optimal. Users may tune \u03b7 to trade off between success probability and threshold; documenting \u03b7=1/2 offers a simple default.\n\nNext steps (actionable)\n1) Add the \u201cPower-law profile\u201d corollary (item 1) to output.md with explicit constants and a short proof (one-liner invoking Corollary 5 with \u03b1=2^{1/p}\u22121).\n2) Add a one-line \u201c25% probability\u201d remark (\u03b7=1/2, c=2) next to the 1% instantiation.\n3) Curate the \u201cglobal smoothness \u21d2 O_A(1) average\u201d corollary (item 3) including the plateau-count bound J=O(A) and the endpoint-term o(1) argument.\n4) For heavy coverage, target a clean geometric hypothesis and prove cost_t(all) \u2265 (\u03b2+1)\u00b7U_t(H) before completing coverage of H; then combine with the eH_t supermartingale to bound expected heavy-collisions and lift to high probability.\n"
