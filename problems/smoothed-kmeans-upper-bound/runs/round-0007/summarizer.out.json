  "summary_md": "Round 0007 produced a simple, unconditional two-level Markov argument that gives a plateau-agnostic constant-mass guarantee over the whole window [k0,2k0): for any c\u22651, P_{k,++}[ALG_k/OPT_k \u2264 c^2\u00b7B_max] \u2265 (1\u22121/c)^2, and taking c=2 yields a 25% joint probability. Using Corollary 11/12 and the fixed-k bound, the authors instantiate explicit global constants: with C_bi=C_fix=5 and K0=35,K1=10,K2=5 they obtain B_max \u2264 45 + 12.5\u00b7ln(2k0) and hence ALG/OPT \u2264 180 + 50\u00b7ln(2k0) with probability \u22651/4. Prover-02 added structural corollaries: power-law decay gives a constant plateau average; a median (\u03b7=1/2) instantiation yields a 25% plateau-level guarantee; and a discrete 1/k-smoothness hypothesis implies an O_A(1) global average. The main remaining technical gap is proving the heavy-coverage persistence denominator to upgrade expected bounds to high-probability. Verifier: partial success.",

    "Parametric tradeoff: choosing c trades threshold vs probability (e.g., c=10 \u2192 prob \u22650.81 at threshold 100\u00b7B_max).",

    "Main obstacle noted: need a persistence denominator (cost_t(all) \u2265 (\u03b2+1)\u00b7U_t(H) before heavy coverage completes) to convert expected-collision bounds into high-probability statements.",
