Round 0007 — New probability guarantees (two-level Markov), explicit global constants, and audit notes

Summary
- I propose a simple, unconditional probability bound that holds on the whole window [k0,2k0): a two-level Markov argument yields a constant-mass guarantee that ALG/OPT is O(log k0) with explicit constants. This meets the “≥0.01 probability” alternative formulation and is stronger (gives ≥25% mass) without any structural assumptions on OPT(·).
- I also instantiate the resulting threshold explicitly when C_bi=C_fix=5, giving a clean numeric bound. The proof only uses the already curated plateau average bounds (Corollary 11/12) and Markov’s inequality.
- Minor audit: I see no correctness issues in output.md. I point out one easy-to-curate addition (the two-level Markov corollary) and provide all steps and constants needed.

Idea — Two-level Markov to get constant joint (k,++) probability
- Setting. For each maximal factor-2 plateau I_j=[m_j,m_j+L_j) with L_j≥2, let
  B_j := K0 + K1·min{ ln^+(2m_j/(L_j−1)), (m_j ln L_j)/L_j, (m_j(1+ln ln L_j))/L_j } + K2·(ln m_j)/L_j
  be the per-plateau envelope from Corollary 11. For L_j=1, use the fixed-k bound D_j := C_fix(ln m_j+O(1)). Let
  B_max := max{ max_{j:L_j≥2} B_j,  max_{j:L_j=1} D_j }.
- Two-level Markov (plateau-agnostic). For each k in [k0,2k0), define Y_k := E_++[ALG_k/OPT_k | k]. From Corollary 11 and the fixed-k bound, Y_k ≤ B_{plateau(k)} ≤ B_max. Then for any c≥1:
  1) Over k, Markov gives P_k[Y_k ≤ c·B_max] ≥ 1 − 1/c.
  2) Conditional on any such k, Markov over ++ gives P_{++}[ ALG_k/OPT_k ≤ c·Y_k ] ≥ 1 − 1/c.
  Combining and using c·Y_k ≤ c·(c·B_max) = c^2·B_max yields the joint bound
  P_{k,++}[ ALG_k/OPT_k ≤ c^2 · B_max ] ≥ (1 − 1/c)^2.
- Consequence (take c=2). With probability at least 1/4 over the joint (k,++) randomness,
  ALG_k/OPT_k ≤ 4·B_max.
- This requires no structural conditions on OPT(·) (no long plateaus, etc.) and directly addresses the alternative task statement (probability ≥ 0.01) with ≥ 0.25.

Explicit global bound on B_max
- For L_j≥2, min{·} ≤ ln^+(2m_j/(L_j−1)) ≤ ln(2·(2k0)/1) = ln(4k0), and (ln m_j)/L_j ≤ (ln(2k0))/2. Hence for L_j≥2,
  B_j ≤ K0 + K1·ln(4k0) + (K2/2)·ln(2k0).
- For L_j=1, D_j ≤ C_fix(ln(2k0)+O(1)). Thus
  B_max ≤ max{ K0 + K1·ln(4k0) + (K2/2)·ln(2k0),  C_fix(ln(2k0)+O(1)) }.
- Instantiation when C_bi=C_fix=5 and K0=35, K1=10, K2=5 (from Corollary 12):
  • L_j≥2: 35 + 10·ln(4k0) + (5/2)·ln(2k0) = 35 + 10 ln 4 + 2.5 ln 2 + 12.5 ln k0 ≈ 50.6 + 12.5 ln k0.
  • L_j=1: 5(ln(2k0)+O(1)) ≤ 10 + 5 ln(2k0).
  For k0 large, the first dominates; a safe uniform bound is
    B_max ≤ 45 + 12.5·ln(2k0)   (conservative; absorbs the O(1) from the L=1 case).

New corollary (proposed for output.md): Unconditional ≥25% probability bound
- Statement. For k uniform on [k0,2k0) and k-means++ randomness, and with B_max as above,
  P[ ALG_k/OPT_k ≤ 4·B_max ] ≥ 1/4.
  In particular, if C_bi=C_fix=5, then for all k0≥2,
  P[ ALG_k/OPT_k ≤ 4(45 + 12.5·ln(2k0)) ] ≥ 1/4,
  i.e., P[ ALG_k/OPT_k ≤ 180 + 50·ln(2k0) ] ≥ 1/4.
- Proof. Immediate from the two-level Markov argument with c=2 and the bound on B_max above. (For small k0 the additive constants can be slightly tightened; the stated numbers are conservative and uniform.)
- Parametric variant. For any c≥1,
  P[ ALG_k/OPT_k ≤ c^2·B_max ] ≥ (1 − 1/c)^2.
  This yields a continuum of tradeoffs; e.g., c=10 gives probability ≥0.81 for a threshold 100·B_max.

Why this is useful
- It gives a clean, structure-free probability guarantee for the alternative task goal (“bound attained with probability ≥0.01”), actually with 25% mass and explicit O(log k0) thresholds.
- It complements Corollary 16/18 (which give stronger constants on long plateaus) by providing a baseline bound even when no plateau is long.
- It is derived entirely from existing curated statements (Corollary 11/12 and the fixed‑k bound), and thus is easy to verify and insert.

Examples and sanity checks
- Worst-case short plateaus (L_j=1 for almost all j): B_max is governed by the fixed-k term 5(ln(2k0)+O(1)), hence the corollary still yields an O(log k0) threshold at ≥25% mass.
- Single long plateau (L≈m): B_max is O(1) (Corollary 5), so the same two-level Markov gives an O(1) threshold with ≥25% mass, consistent with Corollary 16’s stronger constants for ≥1% mass.

Minor audit of output.md (this round)
- The min-of-three per-plateau bound (Corollary 11) and its explicit-constant instantiation (Corollary 12) are correctly stated, including the L≥3 caveat for the third branch.
- Global aggregation (Corollary 13), unconditional O(log k0) (Corollary 14), long-plateau mixture (Corollary 15), and multi-plateau probability (Corollary 18) are coherent. Endpoint-sum control (Lemma 1) is clean and used properly. I see no correctness issues.

Next steps (curation-ready)
1) Add the “Two-level Markov” corollary above to output.md (plateau-agnostic ≥25% probability bound), with the parametric c≥1 version. Include the explicit numeric instantiation for C_bi=C_fix=5.
2) Optionally note (as a remark) that for any target probability p∈(0,1), choosing c=(1−√p)^{-1} gives P≥p at threshold c^2·B_max, making the tradeoff explicit.
3) If desired, very slightly tighten the numeric constant in B_max (e.g., B_max ≤ 42 + 12.5 ln(2k0) as argued in-line); the current 45 + 12.5 ln(2k0) statement is safe and simple.

Obstacles and open items
- Heavy coverage under scale separation: the key “persistence” denominator (cost_t(all) ≥ (β+1)·U_t(H) before heavy coverage completes) remains to be established under clean separation hypotheses. Once proved, the expected-collisions bound can follow by summing conditional probabilities; then Freedman’s inequality can lift to high probability.
- Lower bounds under random-k smoothing: constructing a single dataset producing Ω(log k0) average (or comparable ≥p probability) across the entire window remains open; existing fixed‑k lower bounds depend on k.

Round 0007 — Audit, new structural corollaries, and probability refinements

Overview and quick audit of output.md
- The current file is coherent and self-contained for the plateau calculus. The new branches (τ=⌊m/ln L⌋, balanced split τ=⌊L/2⌋), the global min-of-three envelope, and the multi-plateau probability mixing are all correctly stated with safe constants. I see no blocking correctness errors.
- Small opportunity: Corollary 9 already yields a family of quantile/probability statements for any η∈(0,1). It may be valuable to explicitly record the “median” instantiation (η=1/2) yielding a 25% plateau-level probability, alongside the existing 1% instantiation, for ease of use.

New, checkable additions (proposed to curate)

1) Power-law profile corollary (constant average and explicit constants)
- Statement. Suppose on a window [m,2m) we have 
  OPT_k ∈ [C_1 k^{−p}, C_2 k^{−p}] for some p>0 and constants C_1,C_2>0.
  Then the maximal factor-2 plateau I⊆[m,2m) starting at m has length L≥(2^{1/p}−1)m and hence, by Corollary 5, for k uniform on I,
  E_{k∈I} E_++[ALG/OPT] ≤ 2 C_bi (a+1+ln(2/α)) + o(1), with α:=2^{1/p}−1 and a:=2+1/(2e).
  Consequently, averaging over [m,2m) yields a constant bound depending only on p and C_bi, uniformly for large m.
- Proof sketch (checkable). For k∈[m, m+L), OPT_{m+L} ≥ OPT_m/2 is equivalent to ((m+L)/m)^p ≤ 2, i.e., L ≤ (2^{1/p}−1)m. Hence the factor-2 plateau starting at m has length at least α m with α=2^{1/p}−1. Apply Corollary 5 with this α and note the endpoint term is o(1) as L→∞.
- Why useful. Captures a broad and natural regime (polynomial decay) where random-k smoothing gives a constant bound with explicit dependence on p. This can be turned into explicit numeric constants by plugging C_bi (e.g., 5) and p (examples below).
- Example. For p=1 and C_bi=5, α=1 and the plateau average is ≤ 10(3+1/(2e)+ln 2)+o(1) ≈ 38.8.

2) Median (25%) plateau-level probability guarantee (simple instantiation of Corollary 9)
- Statement. In Corollary 9, choosing η=1/2 and c=2 yields, for k uniform over any plateau I=[m,m+L) with L≥2,
  P_{k,++}[ ALG/OPT ≤ 2·B_I ] ≥ (1−1/2−O(1/L))·(1−1/2) = 1/4 − O(1/L),
  where B_I = 2 C_bi (1 + m/(e(T−1))) and T = max{2, ⌈(L−1)/2⌉+1}. If L ≥ α m, then B_I ≤ 2 C_bi (1 + 2/(α e)) + O(1/L).
- Why useful. Complements the 1% probability remark with a clean, stronger (≈25%) option under the same framework; particularly handy when downstream needs favor a larger success probability, albeit with a larger constant than one might get by tuning η.

3) Discrete 1/k-smoothness across the window ⇒ O_A(1) average (global structural corollary)
- Hypothesis. Suppose for all k∈[k0,2k0) we have
  ln(OPT_{k−1}/OPT_k) ≤ A/k
  for some A>0. (Equivalently, OPT_{k−1} ≤ (1 + A/k) OPT_k.)
- Lemma (plateau length and count). On any factor-2 plateau starting at m within the window, the length satisfies L ≥ (ln 2)·m/A (by Lemma 2 with δ=A/m). Moreover, the starting indices m_j of consecutive plateaus grow multiplicatively by at least (1 + (ln 2)/A). Hence the number of plateaus J across [k0,2k0) is at most ⌈ ln 2 / ln(1 + (ln 2)/A) ⌉ ≤ ⌈ (1 + (ln 2)/A)·A/ln 2 ⌉ = O(A).
  A safe bound is J ≤ ⌈ (A + ln 2)/ln 2 ⌉.
- Corollary (global average). Applying Corollary 5 on each plateau and Corollary 13 for aggregation,
  E_{k∼U([k0,2k0)),++}[ALG/OPT]
  ≤ 2 C_bi (a+1+ln(2/α)) + (C_fix/k0)∑_{j=1}^{J} ln m_j,
  with α=(ln 2)/A. Since J=O(A) and m_j≤2k0, the endpoint term is ≤ C_fix·J·ln(2k0)/k0 = o(1). Therefore,
  E[ALG/OPT] ≤ 2 C_bi (a+1+ln(2A/ln 2)) + o(1),
  i.e., an O_A(1) bound uniformly over the window for large k0.
- Proof sketch (checkable). The length bound is Lemma 2 with δ=A/m. For the count, m_{j+1} ≥ m_j + (ln 2)m_j/A = (1 + (ln 2)/A)m_j; iterating till we exceed 2k0 gives the stated J bound. Aggregation then applies Corollary 5 per plateau and shows the endpoint-sum is negligible because J≪k0.
- Why useful. This supplies a transparent, data-agnostic smoothness condition that forces long plateaus throughout the window and yields a global O(1) average (as a function of A), sharpening the unconditional O(log k0) bound under a verifiable regularity premise.

4) Global mixture corollary from power-law or 1/k-smoothness (explicit probability)
- If the entire window [k0,2k0) satisfies the power-law or 1/k-smoothness hypotheses (items 1–3), then γ=1 in Corollary 16 and in the “25%” remark above. Consequently,
  P_{k,++}[ ALG/OPT ≤ 2·B_I ] ≥ 1/4 − o(1),
  with B_I ≤ 2 C_bi (1 + const) depending only on p (power law) or A (smoothness). This offers a straightforward probability ≥ 0.25 guarantee meeting the alternative task objective with fully explicit constants.

Why these additions are useful here
- They convert common, checkable structural properties of OPT(·) (polynomial decay; bounded discrete derivative) into clean, global O(1) averages and explicit constant-probability statements, strengthening the “why randomizing k helps” narrative beyond single-plateau assumptions.
- All statements are direct instantiations of existing machinery (Lemma 2, Corollary 5, Corollary 9, Corollary 13) and require only short algebraic verifications.

Examples and sanity checks
- Power-law p=1. On [m,2m), α=1; by item 1 with C_bi=5, the plateau average is ≤ 10(3+1/(2e)+ln 2)+o(1) ≈ 38.8; by item 2 with α=1, B_I ≤ 2·5·(1+2/e) ≈ 18.7, giving a 25% probability threshold ≤ 37.4.
- Smoothness A=2. Then α=(ln 2)/2≈0.346; the global average is ≤ 2 C_bi (a+1+ln(2A/ln 2)) + o(1) ≈ 10(3+1/(2e)+ln(2·2/ln 2)) ≈ 10(3.183 + 1.060) ≈ 42.4 (with C_bi=5), plus o(1).

Obstacles and gaps
- Heavy-coverage program. The main missing piece remains a rigorous persistence denominator: a deterministic or high-probability lower bound of the form cost_t(all) ≥ (β+1)·U_t(H) prior to covering all heavy clusters, derivable from a clean separation hypothesis. Once established, summing conditional collision probabilities becomes straightforward.
- Constants for the median probability. The η=1/2 choice is general but not constant-optimal. Users may tune η to trade off between success probability and threshold; documenting η=1/2 offers a simple default.

Next steps (actionable)
1) Add the “Power-law profile” corollary (item 1) to output.md with explicit constants and a short proof (one-liner invoking Corollary 5 with α=2^{1/p}−1).
2) Add a one-line “25% probability” remark (η=1/2, c=2) next to the 1% instantiation.
3) Curate the “global smoothness ⇒ O_A(1) average” corollary (item 3) including the plateau-count bound J=O(A) and the endpoint-term o(1) argument.
4) For heavy coverage, target a clean geometric hypothesis and prove cost_t(all) ≥ (β+1)·U_t(H) before completing coverage of H; then combine with the eH_t supermartingale to bound expected heavy-collisions and lift to high probability.
