Using Corollary 11/12 and the fixed-k bound, the authors instantiate explicit global constants: with C_bi=C_fix=5 and K0=35,K1=10,K2=5 they obtain B_max ≤ 45 + 12.5·ln(2k0) and hence ALG/OPT ≤ 180 + 50·ln(2k0) with probability ≥1/4. Prover-02 added structural corollaries: power-law decay gives a constant plateau average; a median (η=1/2) instantiation yields a 25% plateau-level guarantee; and a discrete 1/k-smoothness hypothesis implies an O_A(1) global average.
