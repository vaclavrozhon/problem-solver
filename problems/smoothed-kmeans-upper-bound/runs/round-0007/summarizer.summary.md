Round 0007 produced a simple, unconditional two-level Markov argument that gives a plateau-agnostic constant-mass guarantee over the whole window [k0,2k0): for any c≥1, P_{k,++}[ALG_k/OPT_k ≤ c^2·B_max] ≥ (1−1/c)^2, and taking c=2 yields a 25% joint probability. Using Corollary 11/12 and the fixed-k bound, the authors instantiate explicit global constants: with C_bi=C_fix=5 and K0=35,K1=10,K2=5 they obtain B_max ≤ 45 + 12.5·ln(2k0) and hence ALG/OPT ≤ 180 + 50·ln(2k0) with probability ≥1/4. Prover-02 added structural corollaries: power-law decay gives a constant plateau average; a median (η=1/2) instantiation yields a 25% plateau-level guarantee; and a discrete 1/k-smoothness hypothesis implies an O_A(1) global average. The main remaining technical gap is proving the heavy-coverage persistence denominator to upgrade expected bounds to high-probability. Verifier: partial success.
