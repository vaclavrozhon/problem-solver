  "summary_md": "Round 0007 produced a simple, unconditional two-level Markov argument that gives a plateau-agnostic constant-mass guarantee over the whole window [k0,2k0): for any c≥1, P_{k,++}[ALG_k/OPT_k ≤ c^2·B_max] ≥ (1−1/c)^2, and taking c=2 yields a 25% joint probability. Using Corollary 11/12 and the fixed-k bound, the authors instantiate explicit global constants: with C_bi=C_fix=5 and K0=35,K1=10,K2=5 they obtain B_max ≤ 45 + 12.5·ln(2k0) and hence ALG/OPT ≤ 180 + 50·ln(2k0) with probability ≥1/4. Prover-02 added structural corollaries: power-law decay gives a constant plateau average; a median (η=1/2) instantiation yields a 25% plateau-level guarantee; and a discrete 1/k-smoothness hypothesis implies an O_A(1) global average. The main remaining technical gap is proving the heavy-coverage persistence denominator to upgrade expected bounds to high-probability. Verifier: partial success.",

    "Two-level Markov fact: for k∼Uniform([k0,2k0)) and k-means++ randomness, P[ALG_k/OPT_k ≤ c^2·B_max] ≥ (1−1/c)^2; c=2 gives P≥1/4.",
    "Explicit numeric instantiation: with C_bi=C_fix=5 and K0=35,K1=10,K2=5, B_max ≤ 45 + 12.5·ln(2k0), so threshold 4·B_max ≤ 180 + 50·ln(2k0).",
    "Parametric tradeoff: choosing c trades threshold vs probability (e.g., c=10 → prob ≥0.81 at threshold 100·B_max).",
    "Structural corollaries (prover-02): power-law OPT_k∝k^{−p} ⇒ constant plateau average; η=1/2 instantiation of Corollary 9 gives ≈25% plateau-level success; discrete 1/k-smoothness ⇒ O_A(1) global average.",
    "Main obstacle noted: need a persistence denominator (cost_t(all) ≥ (β+1)·U_t(H) before heavy coverage completes) to convert expected-collision bounds into high-probability statements.",

    "Prove (or provide a clean geometric hypothesis that implies) the heavy-coverage persistence denominator (cost_t(all) ≥ (β+1)·U_t(H)) so expected collision bounds can be lifted to high probability; optionally pursue a matching lower-bound dataset construction across the full k-window."
