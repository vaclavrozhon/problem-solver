Thank you for the detailed suggestions. Here is a careful audit, triage, and next-step plan.

1) On the “two-level Markov” proposal (Prover 01)
- Core issue. The step “Y_k := E_++[ALG_k/OPT_k | k] ≤ B_{plateau(k)} ≤ B_max” is not justified. Corollary 11 bounds the plateau average E_{k∈I}E_++[ALG/OPT], not each per-k conditional expectation. Within a plateau, per-k expectations can be (and generally are) larger than the plateau average; one cannot upper bound Y_k by the plateau-average envelope B_I without further per-k control.
- Consequently, the chain that applies Markov first over k and then over ++ to get (1−1/c)^2 probability at threshold c^2·B_max is invalid as stated: the first inequality relies on a pointwise bound that we do not have.
- Simple, correct fix (and stronger). Use Markov directly on the joint variable Z := ALG_k/OPT_k with k uniform on [k0,2k0) and ++ randomness. From Corollary 14 we have E[Z] ≤ K′ + K″ ln(2k0) unconditionally. Then Markov gives, for any c≥1, P[Z ≤ c·(K′ + K″ ln(2k0))] ≥ 1 − 1/c. This yields a 50% guarantee at threshold 2·(K′ + K″ ln(2k0)), and more generally a continuum of tradeoffs. No plateau structure is needed. We curate this as a new corollary.
- Optional explicit constants. If one insists on explicit numbers under C_bi=C_fix=5, one can combine Corollaries 12–13 and Lemma 1 to obtain a safe, purely numerical upper bound M(k0) = O(1) + 20 ln(2k0) for E[Z]; then P[Z ≤ c·M(k0)] ≥ 1−1/c. We avoid fixed numerics in output because the +O(1) in the fixed-k bound is not pinned down; the qualitative statement is clean and rigorous.

2) On the power-law and 1/k-smoothness additions (Prover 02)
- Power-law envelope. The idea is good, but the length L of the factor-2 plateau starting at m depends on the constant ratio ρ := C_2/C_1. Correctly, if C_1 k^{-p} ≤ OPT_k ≤ C_2 k^{-p} on the window, then the plateau length satisfies L ≥ ⌊α m⌋ with α := min{1, ((2ρ)^{1/p}−1)}. Your draft omitted the dependence on ρ. With this correction, Corollary 5 yields a per-plateau O(1) bound; moreover, the number of plateaus across [k0,2k0) is O_{p,ρ}(1), so the global average is O_{p,ρ}(1). We curate this as a global corollary.
- Discrete 1/k-smoothness across the window. The argument is sound and sharp in spirit. Assuming ln(OPT_{k−1}/OPT_k) ≤ A/k for all k∈[k0+1,2k0−1], we may apply Lemma 2 with δ=A/m on each plateau starting at m to get L ≥ (ln 2)·m/A up to +O(1) rounding. Hence every plateau is long with α=(ln 2)/A, and Corollary 5 gives a uniform O_A(1) bound per plateau. The number of plateaus in the window is J=O(A), so the endpoint-term contribution is o(1) as k0→∞. We curate this with a clean statement and proof.
- “Median (25%)” instantiation. This is a straightforward and correct specialization of Corollary 9 (take η=1/2, c=2), giving P ≥ 1/4−O(1/L) on a plateau. We add a short remark to make this easy to find.

3) Value and curation triage
- Strong, easy to curate: (i) the unconditional Markov tail from the global expectation; (ii) the global O_A(1) bound under discrete 1/k-smoothness; (iii) the global O_{p,ρ}(1) bound under a two-sided power-law envelope. All are direct corollaries of the current machinery and add clear, reusable statements.
- Not to curate as-is: the “two-level Markov” c^2·B_max with (1−1/c)^2 probability, because it uses a plateau-average envelope as a pointwise per-k bound.

4) Next steps for provers
- If you wish to keep pursuing probability tails at fixed O(log k0) thresholds, try to improve concentration from expectation using Efron–Stein or self-bounding properties for ++, or structure-driven per-k bounds (so that one can apply Markov at the per-k level with a uniform upper bound independent of k). Absent new structure, the simple Markov-on-global-expectation tail is already optimal at this level of information.
- For structural regimes: (a) catalog other “regularity” conditions on OPT(·) (e.g., log-convexity, quasiconvexity of k·OPT_k, or bounded discrete second differences) that imply long plateaus or few plateaus; (b) quantify the best constants α and γ these conditions force, then plug into Corollaries 5, 13, 16, 18 to get explicit averages and probabilities.
- Heavy-coverage program: the blocking piece remains a rigorous, filtration-adapted denominator lower bound before covering all heavy clusters. Prove a persistence inequality of the form cost_t(all) ≥ (β+1)·U_t(H) under a clear separation hypothesis; then bound expected heavy-collisions by summing conditional probabilities and lift to high probability via Freedman.
