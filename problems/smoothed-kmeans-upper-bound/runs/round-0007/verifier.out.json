  "feedback_md": "Thank you for the detailed suggestions. Here is a careful audit, triage, and next-step plan.\n\n1) On the \u201ctwo-level Markov\u201d proposal (Prover 01)\n- Core issue. The step \u201cY_k := E_++[ALG_k/OPT_k | k] \u2264 B_{plateau(k)} \u2264 B_max\u201d is not justified. Corollary 11 bounds the plateau average E_{k\u2208I}E_++[ALG/OPT], not each per-k conditional expectation. Within a plateau, per-k expectations can be (and generally are) larger than the plateau average; one cannot upper bound Y_k by the plateau-average envelope B_I without further per-k control.\n- Consequently, the chain that applies Markov first over k and then over ++ to get (1\u22121/c)^2 probability at threshold c^2\u00b7B_max is invalid as stated: the first inequality relies on a pointwise bound that we do not have.\n- Simple, correct fix (and stronger). Use Markov directly on the joint variable Z := ALG_k/OPT_k with k uniform on [k0,2k0) and ++ randomness. From Corollary 14 we have E[Z] \u2264 K\u2032 + K\u2033 ln(2k0) unconditionally. Then Markov gives, for any c\u22651, P[Z \u2264 c\u00b7(K\u2032 + K\u2033 ln(2k0))] \u2265 1 \u2212 1/c. This yields a 50% guarantee at threshold 2\u00b7(K\u2032 + K\u2033 ln(2k0)), and more generally a continuum of tradeoffs. No plateau structure is needed. We curate this as a new corollary.\n- Optional explicit constants. If one insists on explicit numbers under C_bi=C_fix=5, one can combine Corollaries 12\u201313 and Lemma 1 to obtain a safe, purely numerical upper bound M(k0) = O(1) + 20 ln(2k0) for E[Z]; then P[Z \u2264 c\u00b7M(k0)] \u2265 1\u22121/c. We avoid fixed numerics in output because the +O(1) in the fixed-k bound is not pinned down; the qualitative statement is clean and rigorous.\n\n2) On the power-law and 1/k-smoothness additions (Prover 02)\n- Power-law envelope. The idea is good, but the length L of the factor-2 plateau starting at m depends on the constant ratio \u03c1 := C_2/C_1. Correctly, if C_1 k^{-p} \u2264 OPT_k \u2264 C_2 k^{-p} on the window, then the plateau length satisfies L \u2265 \u230a\u03b1 m\u230b with \u03b1 := min{1, ((2\u03c1)^{1/p}\u22121)}. Your draft omitted the dependence on \u03c1. With this correction, Corollary 5 yields a per-plateau O(1) bound; moreover, the number of plateaus across [k0,2k0) is O_{p,\u03c1}(1), so the global average is O_{p,\u03c1}(1). We curate this as a global corollary.\n- Discrete 1/k-smoothness across the window. The argument is sound and sharp in spirit. Assuming ln(OPT_{k\u22121}/OPT_k) \u2264 A/k for all k\u2208[k0+1,2k0\u22121], we may apply Lemma 2 with \u03b4=A/m on each plateau starting at m to get L \u2265 (ln 2)\u00b7m/A up to +O(1) rounding. Hence every plateau is long with \u03b1=(ln 2)/A, and Corollary 5 gives a uniform O_A(1) bound per plateau. The number of plateaus in the window is J=O(A), so the endpoint-term contribution is o(1) as k0\u2192\u221e. We curate this with a clean statement and proof.\n- \u201cMedian (25%)\u201d instantiation. This is a straightforward and correct specialization of Corollary 9 (take \u03b7=1/2, c=2), giving P \u2265 1/4\u2212O(1/L) on a plateau. We add a short remark to make this easy to find.\n\n3) Value and curation triage\n- Strong, easy to curate: (i) the unconditional Markov tail from the global expectation; (ii) the global O_A(1) bound under discrete 1/k-smoothness; (iii) the global O_{p,\u03c1}(1) bound under a two-sided power-law envelope. All are direct corollaries of the current machinery and add clear, reusable statements.\n- Not to curate as-is: the \u201ctwo-level Markov\u201d c^2\u00b7B_max with (1\u22121/c)^2 probability, because it uses a plateau-average envelope as a pointwise per-k bound.\n\n4) Next steps for provers\n- If you wish to keep pursuing probability tails at fixed O(log k0) thresholds, try to improve concentration from expectation using Efron\u2013Stein or self-bounding properties for ++, or structure-driven per-k bounds (so that one can apply Markov at the per-k level with a uniform upper bound independent of k). Absent new structure, the simple Markov-on-global-expectation tail is already optimal at this level of information.\n- For structural regimes: (a) catalog other \u201cregularity\u201d conditions on OPT(\u00b7) (e.g., log-convexity, quasiconvexity of k\u00b7OPT_k, or bounded discrete second differences) that imply long plateaus or few plateaus; (b) quantify the best constants \u03b1 and \u03b3 these conditions force, then plug into Corollaries 5, 13, 16, 18 to get explicit averages and probabilities.\n- Heavy-coverage program: the blocking piece remains a rigorous, filtration-adapted denominator lower bound before covering all heavy clusters. Prove a persistence inequality of the form cost_t(all) \u2265 (\u03b2+1)\u00b7U_t(H) under a clear separation hypothesis; then bound expected heavy-collisions by summing conditional probabilities and lift to high probability via Freedman.\n",
  "new_notes_md": "Corrections, new unconditional probability, and new structural global regimes\n\n- Caution on plateau-average vs per-k bounds. Corollary 11 (min-of-three envelope) controls the plateau average E_{k\u2208I}E_++[ALG/OPT]. It is not a per-k bound on Y_k:=E_++[ALG_k/OPT_k|k]. Hence one cannot conclude Y_k \u2264 B_I from Corollary 11. Any probability argument that treats the plateau-average envelope as a per-k upper bound (e.g., a \u201ctwo-level Markov\u201d multiplying two Markov factors) is invalid.\n\n- Unconditional probability from the global expectation. Let Z := ALG_k/OPT_k for k uniform on [k0,2k0) and ++ randomness. From Corollary 14, E[Z] \u2264 K\u2032 + K\u2033 ln(2k0) unconditionally.

If desired, one can also instantiate an explicit numerical bound M(k0) from Corollaries 12\u201313 and Lemma 1 when C_bi=C_fix=5, but we keep the symbolic statement in output.md.\n\n- Discrete 1/k-smoothness across the whole window \u21d2 global O_A(1). If OPT_{k\u22121} \u2264 (1 + A/k)\u00b7OPT_k for all k\u2208[k0+1,2k0\u22121], then every factor-2 plateau I=[m,m+L) inside the window has L \u2265 (ln 2)\u00b7m/A up to +O(1). Hence each plateau average is \u2264 2\u00b7C_bi\u00b7(a+1+ln(2A/ln 2)) + o(1) (Corollary 5), with a:=2+1/(2e). The number of plateaus J across [k0,2k0) is O(A), so the endpoint contribution sums to o(1). Therefore E_{k,++}[ALG/OPT] \u2264 2\u00b7C_bi\u00b7(a+1+ln(2A/ln 2)) + o(1).\n\n- Two-sided power-law envelope \u21d2 global O_{p,\u03c1}(1), with explicit \u03b1.

By Corollary 5 each plateau average is \u2264 2\u00b7C_bi\u00b7(a+1+ln(2/\u03b1)) + o(1), and the number of plateaus in the window is O_{p,\u03c1}(1) (since m increases by \u2265(1+\u03b1) each step). Consequently, E_{k,++}[ALG/OPT] \u2264 2\u00b7C_bi\u00b7(a+1+ln(2/\u03b1)) + o(1).\n\n- Plateau-level 25% probability. As an easy specialization of Corollary 9, choosing \u03b7=1/2 and c=2 yields, for any plateau I=[m,m+L) with L\u22652,\n  P_{k\u2208I,++}[ ALG/OPT \u2264 2\u00b7B_I ] \u2265 1/4 \u2212 O(1/L),\nwith B_I=2\u00b7C_bi\u00b7(1 + m/(e(T\u22121))) and T=max{2,\u2308(L\u22121)/2\u2309+1}.
