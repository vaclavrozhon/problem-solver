{"feedback_md":"Thank you for the detailed suggestions. Here is a careful audit, triage, and next-step plan.\n\n1) On the “two-level Markov” proposal (Prover 01)\n- Core issue. The step “Y_k := E_++[ALG_k/OPT_k | k] ≤ B_{plateau(k)} ≤ B_max” is not justified. Corollary 11 bounds the plateau average E_{k∈I}E_++[ALG/OPT], not each per-k conditional expectation. Within a plateau, per-k expectations can be (and generally are) larger than the plateau average; one cannot upper bound Y_k by the plateau-average envelope B_I without further per-k control.\n- Consequently, the chain that applies Markov first over k and then over ++ to get (1−1/c)^2 probability at threshold c^2·B_max is invalid as stated: the first inequality relies on a pointwise bound that we do not have.\n- Simple, correct fix (and stronger). Use Markov directly on the joint variable Z := ALG_k/OPT_k with k uniform on [k0,2k0) and ++ randomness. From Corollary 14 we have E[Z] ≤ K′ + K″ ln(2k0) unconditionally. Then Markov gives, for any c≥1, P[Z ≤ c·(K′ + K″ ln(2k0))] ≥ 1 − 1/c. This yields a 50% guarantee at threshold 2·(K′ + K″ ln(2k0)), and more generally a continuum of tradeoffs. No plateau structure is needed. We curate this as a new corollary.\n- Optional explicit constants. If one insists on explicit numbers under C_bi=C_fix=5, one can combine Corollaries 12–13 and Lemma 1 to obtain a safe, purely numerical upper bound M(k0) = O(1) + 20 ln(2k0) for E[Z]; then P[Z ≤ c·M(k0)] ≥ 1−1/c. We avoid fixed numerics in output because the +O(1) in the fixed-k bound is not pinned down; the qualitative statement is clean and rigorous.\n\n2) On the power-law and 1/k-smoothness additions (Prover 02)\n- Power-law envelope. The idea is good, but the length L of the factor-2 plateau starting at m depends on the constant ratio ρ := C_2/C_1. Correctly, if C_1 k^{-p} ≤ OPT_k ≤ C_2 k^{-p} on the window, then the plateau length satisfies L ≥ ⌊α m⌋ with α := min{1, ((2ρ)^{1/p}−1)}. Your draft omitted the dependence on ρ. With this correction, Corollary 5 yields a per-plateau O(1) bound; moreover, the number of plateaus across [k0,2k0) is O_{p,ρ}(1), so the global average is O_{p,ρ}(1). We curate this as a global corollary.\n- Discrete 1/k-smoothness across the window. The argument is sound and sharp in spirit. Assuming ln(OPT_{k−1}/OPT_k) ≤ A/k for all k∈[k0+1,2k0−1], we may apply Lemma 2 with δ=A/m on each plateau starting at m to get L ≥ (ln 2)·m/A up to +O(1) rounding. Hence every plateau is long with α=(ln 2)/A, and Corollary 5 gives a uniform O_A(1) bound per plateau. The number of plateaus in the window is J=O(A), so the endpoint-term contribution is o(1) as k0→∞. We curate this with a clean statement and proof.\n- “Median (25%)” instantiation. This is a straightforward and correct specialization of Corollary 9 (take η=1/2, c=2), giving P ≥ 1/4−O(1/L) on a plateau. We add a short remark to make this easy to find.\n\n3) Value and curation triage\n- Strong, easy to curate: (i) the unconditional Markov tail from the global expectation; (ii) the global O_A(1) bound under discrete 1/k-smoothness; (iii) the global O_{p,ρ}(1) bound under a two-sided power-law envelope. All are direct corollaries of the current machinery and add clear, reusable statements.\n- Not to curate as-is: the “two-level Markov” c^2·B_max with (1−1/c)^2 probability, because it uses a plateau-average envelope as a pointwise per-k bound.\n\n4) Next steps for provers\n- If you wish to keep pursuing probability tails at fixed O(log k0) thresholds, try to improve concentration from expectation using Efron–Stein or self-bounding properties for ++, or structure-driven per-k bounds (so that one can apply Markov at the per-k level with a uniform upper bound independent of k). Absent new structure, the simple Markov-on-global-expectation tail is already optimal at this level of information.\n- For structural regimes: (a) catalog other “regularity” conditions on OPT(·) (e.g., log-convexity, quasiconvexity of k·OPT_k, or bounded discrete second differences) that imply long plateaus or few plateaus; (b) quantify the best constants α and γ these conditions force, then plug into Corollaries 5, 13, 16, 18 to get explicit averages and probabilities.\n- Heavy-coverage program: the blocking piece remains a rigorous, filtration-adapted denominator lower bound before covering all heavy clusters. Prove a persistence inequality of the form cost_t(all) ≥ (β+1)·U_t(H) under a clear separation hypothesis; then bound expected heavy-collisions by summing conditional probabilities and lift to high probability via Freedman.\n","new_notes_md":"Corrections, new unconditional probability, and new structural global regimes\n\n- Caution on plateau-average vs per-k bounds. Corollary 11 (min-of-three envelope) controls the plateau average E_{k∈I}E_++[ALG/OPT]. It is not a per-k bound on Y_k:=E_++[ALG_k/OPT_k|k]. Hence one cannot conclude Y_k ≤ B_I from Corollary 11. Any probability argument that treats the plateau-average envelope as a per-k upper bound (e.g., a “two-level Markov” multiplying two Markov factors) is invalid.\n\n- Unconditional probability from the global expectation. Let Z := ALG_k/OPT_k for k uniform on [k0,2k0) and ++ randomness. From Corollary 14, E[Z] ≤ K′ + K″ ln(2k0) unconditionally. Markov’s inequality gives for any c≥1:\n  P[ Z ≤ c·(K′ + K″ ln(2k0)) ] ≥ 1 − 1/c.\nThis yields a simple, structure-free probability guarantee (e.g., 50% at threshold 2·(K′ + K″ ln(2k0)); 90% at threshold 10·(K′ + K″ ln(2k0))). If desired, one can also instantiate an explicit numerical bound M(k0) from Corollaries 12–13 and Lemma 1 when C_bi=C_fix=5, but we keep the symbolic statement in output.md.\n\n- Discrete 1/k-smoothness across the whole window ⇒ global O_A(1). If OPT_{k−1} ≤ (1 + A/k)·OPT_k for all k∈[k0+1,2k0−1], then every factor-2 plateau I=[m,m+L) inside the window has L ≥ (ln 2)·m/A up to +O(1). Hence each plateau average is ≤ 2·C_bi·(a+1+ln(2A/ln 2)) + o(1) (Corollary 5), with a:=2+1/(2e). The number of plateaus J across [k0,2k0) is O(A), so the endpoint contribution sums to o(1). Therefore E_{k,++}[ALG/OPT] ≤ 2·C_bi·(a+1+ln(2A/ln 2)) + o(1).\n\n- Two-sided power-law envelope ⇒ global O_{p,ρ}(1), with explicit α. Suppose for all k∈[k0,2k0) we have C_1 k^{-p} ≤ OPT_k ≤ C_2 k^{-p} with p>0 and ρ:=C_2/C_1. Set α:=min{1, ((2ρ)^{1/p}−1)}. Then for any plateau starting at m, for all t≤⌊α m⌋−1,\n  OPT_{m+t}/OPT_m ≥ (C_1/C_2)·(m/(m+t))^p ≥ (C_1/C_2)·(1/(1+α))^p ≥ 1/2,\nso L ≥ ⌊α m⌋. By Corollary 5 each plateau average is ≤ 2·C_bi·(a+1+ln(2/α)) + o(1), and the number of plateaus in the window is O_{p,ρ}(1) (since m increases by ≥(1+α) each step). Consequently, E_{k,++}[ALG/OPT] ≤ 2·C_bi·(a+1+ln(2/α)) + o(1).\n\n- Plateau-level 25% probability. As an easy specialization of Corollary 9, choosing η=1/2 and c=2 yields, for any plateau I=[m,m+L) with L≥2,\n  P_{k∈I,++}[ ALG/OPT ≤ 2·B_I ] ≥ 1/4 − O(1/L),\nwith B_I=2·C_bi·(1 + m/(e(T−1))) and T=max{2,⌈(L−1)/2⌉+1}. If L≥α m then B_I ≤ 2·C_bi·(1+2/(α e)) + O(1/L).\n\nNext steps\n- For probability tails beyond Markov, seek per-k upper bounds (under structure) that hold for a constant fraction of k, enabling a one-level Markov at lower thresholds.\n- Explore other regularity conditions on OPT(·) that enforce either long plateaus or few plateaus across [k0,2k0), and translate them into global averages and constant-probability bounds via our plateau calculus.\n- For the heavy-coverage program, focus on proving a filtration-adapted denominator lower bound cost_t(all) ≥ (β+1)·U_t(H) up to the stopping time when H is fully covered, under explicit geometric/separation hypotheses; then sum conditional collision probabilities and apply Freedman to lift to high probability.\n","new_notes_append":"True","new_outputs_md":"Corollary 21 (Unconditional Markov tail from the global expectation).\nLet k be uniform on [k0,2k0) and consider the joint randomness of k and k-means++.

In particular, the RHS depends only on A and C_bi.\nProof.\nFix a maximal factor-2 plateau I_j=[m_j,m_j+L_j) within [k0,2k0). Since A/k ≤ A/m_j for k≥m_j, we have OPT_{k−1} ≤ (1 + A/m_j)·OPT_k for all k∈{m_j+1,…,m_j+L_j−1}. Applying Lemma 2 with δ=A/m_j yields L_j ≥ 1 + ⌈(\\ln 2)·m_j/A⌉, i.e., L_j ≥ (\\ln 2)·m_j/A up to +O(1). Thus each plateau is long with α:=(\\ln 2)/A. By Corollary 5,\n  E_{k∈I_j} E_++[ ALG/OPT ] ≤ 2·C_bi · ( a + 1 + \\ln(2/α) ) + (C_fix·\\ln m_j)/L_j.\nSumming with weights L_j/k0 across plateaus (Corollary 13) yields\n  E_{k,++}[ ALG/OPT ] ≤ 2·C_bi · ( a + 1 + \\ln(2A/\\ln 2) ) + (C_fix/k0)∑_j \\ln m_j.\nThe number of plateaus J across [k0,2k0) is O(A): indeed, m_{j+1} ≥ m_j + (\\ln 2)·m_j/A = (1 + (\\ln 2)/A)·m_j, so J ≤ ⌈ \\ln 2 / \\ln(1 + (\\ln 2)/A) ⌉ = O(A).

Then, for k uniform on [k0,2k0) and k-means++ randomness,\n  E_{k,++}[ ALG_k / OPT_k ] ≤ 2·C_bi · ( a + 1 + \\ln(2/α) ) + o(1)  as k0→∞,\nwhere a:=2 + 1/(2e), and the implicit constants depend only on p and ρ.\nProof.\nLet I=[m,m+L) be a maximal factor-2 plateau inside the window. For any t with 0≤t≤⌊α m⌋−1,\n  OPT_{m+t} / OPT_m ≥ (C_1 (m+t)^{−p}) / (C_2 m^{−p}) = (C_1/C_2) · (m/(m+t))^p ≥ (C_1/C_2) · (1/(1+α))^p.\nBy the choice of α≤α_0 we have (C_1/C_2)·(1/(1+α))^p ≥ 1/2, hence OPT_{m+t} > OPT_m/2. Therefore the plateau length satisfies L ≥ ⌊α m⌋. Applying Corollary 5 with this α gives for each plateau\n  E_{k∈I} E_++[ ALG/OPT ] ≤ 2·C_bi · ( a + 1 + \\ln(2/α) ) + (C_fix·\\ln m)/L.\nAcross [k0,2k0) the number of plateaus is O_{p,ρ}(1), since m increases by at least a factor 1+α from plateau to plateau until reaching 2k0. Weighting by L/k0 and summing (Corollary 13) yields the stated global bound, with the endpoint contribution (C_fix/k0)∑ \\ln m_j = o(1) because the sum has O_{p,ρ}(1) terms. ∎\n","new_outputs_append":"True","verdict":"partial success"}
