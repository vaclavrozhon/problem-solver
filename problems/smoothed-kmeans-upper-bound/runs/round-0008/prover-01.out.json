  "progress_md": "Round 0008 \u2014 Small, checkable additions: direct s(k)-averaging, L=2 plateau, and a sharper weighted endpoint bound\n\nAudit of output.md (no blocking issues)\n- The file is coherent and the earlier two-level Markov pitfall has been avoided; Corollary 21 (Markov from the global expectation) is correct. Power-law (Cor. 23), discrete 1/k-smoothness (Cor. 22), the min-of-three envelope (Cor. 11\u201312), balanced split (Cor. 17), and multi-plateau probability mixing (Cor. 18) are all consistent. I found no correctness errors.\n- Opportunities: (i) add a direct, per-k s(k)-based averaging corollary (complements the plateau calculus and can be tighter on highly irregular OPT profiles), (ii) state an exact bound for the L=2 plateau edge case (ties together the \u0394=0 endpoint and the single \u0394=1 term cleanly), and (iii) slightly sharpen the weighted endpoint term bound used in the global aggregation (replace \u2264 ln(2k0) by \u2264 ln(2k0) \u2212 1 + O(1/k0)). All are strictly incremental and immediately checkable from existing statements.\n\nNew, checkable additions (proposed to curate)\n\n1) Direct s(k)-based global averaging (complements plateau calculus)\n- Statement (s(k)-averaging). For k uniform on [k0,2k0), let s(k) := min{s\u2264k: OPT_s \u2264 2\u00b7OPT_k} and \u0394(k):=k\u2212s(k). Then\n  E_{k\u223cU([k0,2k0)),++}[ ALG_k/OPT_k ]\n  \u2264 (1/k0) \u2211_{k=k0}^{2k0\u22121} G(k),\n  where for each k: if \u0394(k)\u22651,\n    G(k) := 2\u00b7C_bi\u00b7min{ a + ln(2 s(k)/\u0394(k)), 1 + s(k)/(e(\u0394(k)\u22121)) },\n  and if \u0394(k)=0,\n    G(k) := C_fix\u00b7(ln k + O(1)).\n  Here a:=2 + 1/(2e).\n- Proof. Immediate from Theorem 1 applied pointwise to each k, followed by averaging over k. No additional assumptions required.\n- Why useful. This gives a \u201cfine-grained\u201d alternative to plateau aggregation. For instance, if \u0394(k) is large on a nontrivial fraction of k, the logarithmic branch yields O(ln ln k) rather than O(ln k), independently of how plateaus are grouped.\n- Simple application (illustrative). Suppose for some \u03b2\u2208(0,1] and for at least a \u03b3-fraction of k\u2208[k0,2k0) we have \u0394(k) \u2265 \u03b2\u00b7k/ln k. Then for each such k,\n  a + ln(2 s(k)/\u0394(k)) \u2264 a + ln( 2k / (\u03b2\u00b7k/ln k) ) = a + ln((2/\u03b2) ln k)\n  = O(ln ln k).\n  Averaging gives a \u03b3-weighted O(ln ln k0) contribution on this subset of k, independent of plateau structure. The remaining (1\u2212\u03b3)-fraction can be bounded by the unconditional O(ln k0) envelope (Cor. 14).\n\n2) Exact L=2 plateau bound (edge case cleaned up)\n- Setting. Consider a factor-2 plateau I=[m,m+2) (so L=2). There are only two indices: k=m (\u0394=0) and k=m+1 (\u0394=1).\n- Statement. For k uniform on I and ++ randomness,\n  E_{k\u2208I,++}[ ALG/OPT ]\n  \u2264 (1/2)\u00b7C_fix\u00b7(ln m + O(1))\n    + (1/2)\u00b72\u00b7C_bi\u00b7( a + ln(2 s(m+1)/1) ).\n  In particular, since s(m+1) \u2264 m,\n  E_{k\u2208I,++}[ ALG/OPT ] \u2264 (1/2)\u00b7C_fix\u00b7(ln m + O(1)) + C_bi\u00b7( a + ln(2m) ).\n- Proof. Combine the fixed-k bound at k=m (\u0394=0) with Theorem 1 at k=m+1 (\u0394=1), then average the two values. Use monotonicity s(m+1)\u2264m on a factor-2 plateau to simplify.\n- Why useful. This gives a crisp and slightly tighter edge-case bound, avoiding any invocation of the ln ln branch and making the constants explicit for L=2.\n\n3) Sharper weighted endpoint-sum bound in the global aggregation\n- Context. Corollary 14 bounds the weighted endpoint term by\n  (1/k0)\u2211_{j:L_j\u22652} L_j ln m_j \u2264 (1/k0)\u2211_{k=k0}^{2k0\u22121} ln k \u2264 ln(2k0).\n- Refinement (optional). Using the integral test,\n  (1/k0)\u2211_{k=k0}^{2k0\u22121} ln k \u2264 (1/k0)\u222b_{k0\u22121}^{2k0\u22121} ln x dx\n  = (1/k0)[ x ln x \u2212 x ]_{k0\u22121}^{2k0\u22121}\n  = ln(2k0\u22121) \u2212 1 \u2212 [(k0\u22121)/k0]\u00b7(ln(k0\u22121) \u2212 1)\n  = ln(2k0) \u2212 1 + O(1/k0).\n  Thus a slightly tighter numerical form is available:\n  (1/k0)\u2211_{j:L_j\u22652} L_j ln m_j \u2264 ln(2k0) \u2212 1 + O(1/k0).\n- Why useful. This improves only the additive constant and can be recorded as a remark without changing asymptotics. It may simplify explicit constant bookkeeping in numerical instantiations.\n\nSanity checks and examples\n- s(k)-averaging vs plateau calculus. On a profile with many small gaps (\u0394(k)=1 for most k), s(k)-averaging reproduces the \u0398(ln k0) behavior by summing a + ln(2 s/1) \u2248 a + ln(2k) over k and averaging. Conversely, if a sizeable fraction has \u0394(k) \u2273 k/ln k, the s(k)-formulation immediately gives an O(ln ln k0) contribution for that fraction, independently of how plateaus are bundled.\n- L=2 edge case. For C_bi=C_fix=5 and a=2+1/(2e), the bound reads\n  E_{k\u2208I,++}[ALG/OPT] \u2264 (5/2)\u00b7ln m + 5\u00b7(a + ln(2m)) + O(1),\n  which is fully explicit and avoids any ln ln terms.\n\nWhy these are incremental and auditable\n- The s(k)-averaging corollary is a direct averaging of Theorem 1 pointwise bounds; proof is one line.\n- The L=2 plateau bound is an exact two-point average of existing per-k guarantees (Theorem 1 and the fixed-k bound).\n- The weighted endpoint refinement is a standard integral estimate; constants are explicit and easily checked.\n\nGaps and open items (for future rounds)\n- Heavy-coverage program. A next concrete step remains a geometric inequality under \u03bb-separation bounding the total D^2-mass outside uncovered heavy clusters by a small multiple of the uncovered-heavy mass plus a controlled covered-heavy term. Combined with the eH_t supermartingale, this would imply a persistence denominator and yield a bounded expected number of heavy-collisions. I will attempt to formalize this under an explicit \u03bb-separation in the next round.\n- Probability threshold tuning (\u22651%). Given the tradeoff P \u2265 (1\u2212\u03b7)(1\u22121/c) and threshold \u221d c(1 + 1/(\u03b1 e \u03b7)), one can optimize c and \u03b7 numerically to slightly improve over (\u03b7,c)=(0.98,2). A closed-form minimizer for c\u00b7(1 + b/\u03b7) subject to (1\u2212\u03b7)(1\u22121/c)\u2265p0 can be derived via reparameterization t=1\u22121/c; I will provide a small table of improved pairs for p0=0.01 and typical \u03b1 in a later pass (constants only).\n\nProposed insertions in output.md\n- Add \u201cCorollary (Direct s(k)-averaging)\u201d with the displayed formula and a one-line proof.\n- Add \u201cCorollary (L=2 plateau bound)\u201d with the explicit average stated above.\n- Add a \u201cRemark (Weighted endpoint sum: slightly sharper bound)\u201d after Corollary 14, with the ln(2k0) \u2212 1 + O(1/k0) refinement.\n\n"
