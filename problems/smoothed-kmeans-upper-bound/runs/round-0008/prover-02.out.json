  "progress_md": "Round 0008 \u2014 Audit, minor fixes, and concrete, checkable additions (balanced-split integration, per-k caution, heavy-coverage step, and a lower-bound blueprint)\n\nAudit of output.md (status and small clarifications)\n- Overall coherence. The file is now consistent with prior audits. In particular, the previously invalid \u201ctwo-level Markov\u201d argument (which misused per-plateau averages as per-k bounds) is not present. Instead, Corollary 21 applies Markov to the global expectation (Corollary 14), giving a clean, unconditional probability tail. Good.\n- Edge case L=2. The restriction \u201cthe third term only for L\u22653\u201d appears in both Corollaries 11\u201312 and a clarifying remark. This fixes the ln ln 2 issue.\n- Balanced split \u03c4=\u230aL/2\u230b. Corollary 17 is correct with safe constants; the harmonic tail bound H_{L\u22122}\u2212H_{\u03c4\u22121} \u2264 ln 3 + 1 is conservative and valid (e.g., via H_n\u2212H_m \u2264 ln((n+1)/(m+1)) + 1 and \u03c4\u2248L/2). This branch is not yet integrated into the per-plateau min envelope (Cor. 11/12); see \u201cIdeas\u201d below.\n- Discrete-smoothness and power-law regimes. Corollaries 22\u201323 provide global O_A(1)/O_{p,\u03c1}(1) averages. The dependence on \u03c1 in Cor. 23 is handled via \u03b1 := min{1, ((2\u03c1)^{1/p}\u22121)}; this is correct.\n- Probability remarks. Corollary 21 (unconditional Markov tail) is now the correct baseline. The plateau-level 25% remark after Corollary 9 is also correct and useful.\n\nGaps or minor improvements recommended for output.md\n1) Integrate the balanced-split branch into the envelope. Corollary 17 provides a midrange option that turns the tail from (m ln L)/L into a pure O(m/L) term at the cost of a larger coefficient on the logarithmic piece. It is simple to add a \u201cmin-of-four\u201d envelope to Corollaries 11\u201312:\n   - Replace the min-of-three by a min-of-four including the \u03c4=\u230aL/2\u230b instantiation. This can only tighten the bound; constants remain explicit.\n   - Rationale: For moderate L (e.g., L\u2248\u0398(m^\u03b8) with small \u03b8), the balanced split can beat the \u03c4=1 hybrid, while the pure-log branch still dominates when L\u226am.\n2) Add a cautionary remark on per-k vs plateau averages. To preempt misuse, add a short remark after Corollary 11: \u201cThe per-plateau bound is for E_{k\u2208I} E_++[\u00b7]. It does not upper bound E_++[ALG_k/OPT_k] for each k\u2208I individually.\u201d This reflects the verifier\u2019s earlier note and prevents future confusion.\n3) Optional numerics under C_bi=C_fix=5 for Corollary 14. If desired, instantiate K\u2032,K\u2033 conservatively by tracing constants in Corollaries 7\u20138 and Lemma 1; a safe choice is K\u2033\u224815 (from 2\u00b7C_bi for the log branch plus the endpoint term\u2019s coefficient) and K\u2032\u2248O(1). This is optional since the asymptotics and the parametric form in Corollary 21 suffice.\n\nIdeas \u2014 two checkable additions\n- Min-of-four per-plateau envelope (integration of Cor. 17): For L\u22653, extend Corollaries 11\u201312 to\n  E_{k\u2208I}E_++[ALG/OPT] \u2264 K0 + K1\u00b7min{ ln^+(2m/(L\u22121)), (m ln L)/L, (m(1+ln ln L))/L, (m/L) } + K2\u00b7(ln m)/L,\n  where the new fourth term comes from Cor. 17 (absorbing constants). This is mechanically checkable by taking the minimum of four explicit instantiations (\u03c4=L\u22121, \u03c4=1, \u03c4=\u230am/ln L\u230b, \u03c4=\u230aL/2\u230b).\n- Explicit per-k caution (remark): \u201cPer-plateau averaged bounds limit the mean of E_++[ALG_k/OPT_k] over k\u2208I. They are not pointwise upper bounds in k. Probability tails that mix over k should use the plateau-level quantile (Cor. 9) or the global expectation (Cor. 14) as in Cor. 21.\u201d This remark is short and closes a known pitfall.\n\nHeavy-coverage program \u2014 a concrete, conditional lemma and a path to a separation condition\n- Conditional lemma (expectation form; ready to curate upon acceptance). Let H be k1 optimal clusters (\u201cheavy\u201d) with S_H:=\u2211_{P\u2208H} OPT1(P). Consider the stopping time \u03c4 when all heavy clusters are first covered. Suppose up to \u03c4 we have:\n  (i) Dominance/persistence: U_t(H) \u2265 \u03b2\u00b7(H_t(all) + U_t(L)) for all t<\u03c4;\n  (ii) Covered-heavy control: E[H_t(H)] \u2264 \u03b1\u00b7S_H for all t (\u03b1=5 holds via the eH_t supermartingale and Lemma 4.1 of MRS).\n  Then the expected number of \u201cheavy collisions\u201d (picks from already-covered heavy clusters) before \u03c4 is at most (\u03b1/(\u03b2+1))\u00b7k1\u00b7(S_H/inf_{t<\u03c4} U_t(H)). In particular, if inf_{t<\u03c4} U_t(H) \u2265 S_H, then E[collisions] \u2264 (\u03b1/(\u03b2+1))\u00b7k1.\n  Sketch (audit-friendly): At step t, p_t^{ch} = H_t(H)/cost_t(all) \u2264 \u03b1 S_H/((\u03b2+1)U_t(H)) by (i)\u2013(ii). Summing over at most k1 heavy hits and lower-bounding U_t(H) by inf_{s<\u03c4} U_s(H) gives the bound.\n- Next target (separation \u21d2 persistence): Prove that under a clean geometric separation (e.g., every heavy cluster P is \u03bb-separated from other clusters: dist(\u00b5_P, y) \u2265 \u03bb\u00b7rad(P) for all y\u2209P, \u03bb\u2265C), one has cost_t(all) \u2265 (\u03b2+1)\u00b7U_t(H) for all t<\u03c4 with \u03b2=\u03a9(1) and inf_{t<\u03c4} U_t(H) \u2265 c\u00b7S_H (c=\u03a9(1)). This would complete a checkable expected-collision bound; Freedman\u2019s inequality could then upgrade it to high probability. I will attempt to formalize: (a) an \u201coutside mass\u201d inequality bounding non-heavy D^2-mass by \u2264 (1/\u0398(\u03bb^2))\u00b7U_t(H) + O(S_H), and (b) a persistence lower bound for U_t(H) until coverage.\n\nLower bound blueprint under random-k smoothing (toward \u03a9(log k0) unconditionally)\n- Goal. Show that without structural constraints on OPT(\u00b7), randomizing k cannot beat \u0398(log k0) in expectation over k (matching Corollary 14) by constructing a dataset with \u0394(k)=1 on a 1\u2212o(1) fraction of k in [k0,2k0), so s(k)=k\u22121 almost always and the per-k MRS bound averages to \u0398(log k0).\n- Plan. Adapt the Arthur\u2013Vassilvitskii family to a windowed construction: arrange a sequence of \u201cmicro\u201d plateaus of length 1 by calibrating radii so OPT_{k\u22121}/OPT_k \u2248 1 + \u0398(1/ln k0) for most k, forcing short plateaus and ensuring that the log branch contributes \u2248 ln(2m/(L\u22121))\u2248 ln m at almost every k. This makes the global average \u2273 c ln k0. I will work out the parameterization and the window-localization of their Lemma 4.1 argument in the next round.\n\nExamples and sanity checks\n- Where balanced split helps. Take m large and L \u2248 m^0.4 (so ln L \u2248 0.4 ln m). Then the hybrid term gives \u2248 (m ln L)/L \u2248 m^0.6 ln m; the balanced-split tail gives \u2248 (m/L)\u00b7const \u2248 m^0.6, shaving a factor \u0398(ln m) in the tail, while the log piece remains comparable. The min-of-four will pick the balanced split in such regimes.\n- Plateau-level probability. For any I with L\u2265\u03b1 m and \u03b7=1/2, c=2, the remark after Cor. 9 yields P[ALG/OPT \u2264 2\u00b7B_I] \u2265 1/4\u2212O(1/L), B_I \u2264 2\u00b7C_bi(1+2/(\u03b1 e))+O(1/L). This gives a stronger (\u224825%) success mass than the 1% global instantiation, at the cost of only plateau-local mixing.\n\nNext steps (verifiable)\n1) Modify Corollaries 11\u201312 to include the balanced-split branch (\u03c4=\u230aL/2\u230b) in the minimum (min-of-four), with the existing constants from Corollary 17; keep the L\u22653 caveat.\n2) Insert the per-k cautionary remark after Corollary 11 (or in a \u201cRemarks\u201d subsection) to prevent future misuse of plateau averages as per-k bounds.\n3) Heavy coverage: formalize the \u201coutside mass\u201d inequality under \u03bb-separation and derive explicit \u03b2,c=\u03a9(1), then state and curate the expected-collision lemma as a conditional result; prepare to apply Freedman for high-probability.\n4) Lower bound: specify an explicit instance whose windowed OPT-profile enforces L_j=1 for most k in [k0,2k0), then adapt the AV07 lower-bound summation to the uniform-k average, yielding an \u03a9(log k0) lower bound for the random-k experiment.\n\nWhy these are incremental and auditable\n- The min-of-four integration and the per-k caution are mechanical and locally verifiable.\n- The heavy-coverage lemma isolates explicit parameters (\u03b2, \u03b1, S_H, inf U_t(H)) and converts them into a clear expected-collision bound; the remaining geometric step will be stated precisely and proved.\n- The lower-bound blueprint follows established constructions; localizing them to the random-k window is a concrete, checkable task.\n"
