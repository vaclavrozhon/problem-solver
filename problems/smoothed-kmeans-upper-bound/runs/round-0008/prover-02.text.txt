{"progress_md":"Round 0008 — Audit, minor fixes, and concrete, checkable additions (balanced-split integration, per-k caution, heavy-coverage step, and a lower-bound blueprint)\n\nAudit of output.md (status and small clarifications)\n- Overall coherence. The file is now consistent with prior audits. In particular, the previously invalid “two-level Markov” argument (which misused per-plateau averages as per-k bounds) is not present. Instead, Corollary 21 applies Markov to the global expectation (Corollary 14), giving a clean, unconditional probability tail. Good.\n- Edge case L=2. The restriction “the third term only for L≥3” appears in both Corollaries 11–12 and a clarifying remark. This fixes the ln ln 2 issue.\n- Balanced split τ=⌊L/2⌋. Corollary 17 is correct with safe constants; the harmonic tail bound H_{L−2}−H_{τ−1} ≤ ln 3 + 1 is conservative and valid (e.g., via H_n−H_m ≤ ln((n+1)/(m+1)) + 1 and τ≈L/2). This branch is not yet integrated into the per-plateau min envelope (Cor. 11/12); see “Ideas” below.\n- Discrete-smoothness and power-law regimes. Corollaries 22–23 provide global O_A(1)/O_{p,ρ}(1) averages. The dependence on ρ in Cor. 23 is handled via α := min{1, ((2ρ)^{1/p}−1)}; this is correct.\n- Probability remarks. Corollary 21 (unconditional Markov tail) is now the correct baseline. The plateau-level 25% remark after Corollary 9 is also correct and useful.\n\nGaps or minor improvements recommended for output.md\n1) Integrate the balanced-split branch into the envelope. Corollary 17 provides a midrange option that turns the tail from (m ln L)/L into a pure O(m/L) term at the cost of a larger coefficient on the logarithmic piece. It is simple to add a “min-of-four” envelope to Corollaries 11–12:\n   - Replace the min-of-three by a min-of-four including the τ=⌊L/2⌋ instantiation. This can only tighten the bound; constants remain explicit.\n   - Rationale: For moderate L (e.g., L≈Θ(m^θ) with small θ), the balanced split can beat the τ=1 hybrid, while the pure-log branch still dominates when L≪m.\n2) Add a cautionary remark on per-k vs plateau averages. To preempt misuse, add a short remark after Corollary 11: “The per-plateau bound is for E_{k∈I} E_++[·]. It does not upper bound E_++[ALG_k/OPT_k] for each k∈I individually.” This reflects the verifier’s earlier note and prevents future confusion.\n3) Optional numerics under C_bi=C_fix=5 for Corollary 14. If desired, instantiate K′,K″ conservatively by tracing constants in Corollaries 7–8 and Lemma 1; a safe choice is K″≈15 (from 2·C_bi for the log branch plus the endpoint term’s coefficient) and K′≈O(1). This is optional since the asymptotics and the parametric form in Corollary 21 suffice.\n\nIdeas — two checkable additions\n- Min-of-four per-plateau envelope (integration of Cor. 17): For L≥3, extend Corollaries 11–12 to\n  E_{k∈I}E_++[ALG/OPT] ≤ K0 + K1·min{ ln^+(2m/(L−1)), (m ln L)/L, (m(1+ln ln L))/L, (m/L) } + K2·(ln m)/L,\n  where the new fourth term comes from Cor. 17 (absorbing constants). This is mechanically checkable by taking the minimum of four explicit instantiations (τ=L−1, τ=1, τ=⌊m/ln L⌋, τ=⌊L/2⌋).\n- Explicit per-k caution (remark): “Per-plateau averaged bounds limit the mean of E_++[ALG_k/OPT_k] over k∈I. They are not pointwise upper bounds in k. Probability tails that mix over k should use the plateau-level quantile (Cor. 9) or the global expectation (Cor. 14) as in Cor. 21.” This remark is short and closes a known pitfall.\n\nHeavy-coverage program — a concrete, conditional lemma and a path to a separation condition\n- Conditional lemma (expectation form; ready to curate upon acceptance). Let H be k1 optimal clusters (“heavy”) with S_H:=∑_{P∈H} OPT1(P). Consider the stopping time τ when all heavy clusters are first covered. Suppose up to τ we have:\n  (i) Dominance/persistence: U_t(H) ≥ β·(H_t(all) + U_t(L)) for all t<τ;\n  (ii) Covered-heavy control: E[H_t(H)] ≤ α·S_H for all t (α=5 holds via the eH_t supermartingale and Lemma 4.1 of MRS).\n  Then the expected number of “heavy collisions” (picks from already-covered heavy clusters) before τ is at most (α/(β+1))·k1·(S_H/inf_{t<τ} U_t(H)). In particular, if inf_{t<τ} U_t(H) ≥ S_H, then E[collisions] ≤ (α/(β+1))·k1.\n  Sketch (audit-friendly): At step t, p_t^{ch} = H_t(H)/cost_t(all) ≤ α S_H/((β+1)U_t(H)) by (i)–(ii). Summing over at most k1 heavy hits and lower-bounding U_t(H) by inf_{s<τ} U_s(H) gives the bound.\n- Next target (separation ⇒ persistence): Prove that under a clean geometric separation (e.g., every heavy cluster P is λ-separated from other clusters: dist(µ_P, y) ≥ λ·rad(P) for all y∉P, λ≥C), one has cost_t(all) ≥ (β+1)·U_t(H) for all t<τ with β=Ω(1) and inf_{t<τ} U_t(H) ≥ c·S_H (c=Ω(1)). This would complete a checkable expected-collision bound; Freedman’s inequality could then upgrade it to high probability. I will attempt to formalize: (a) an “outside mass” inequality bounding non-heavy D^2-mass by ≤ (1/Θ(λ^2))·U_t(H) + O(S_H), and (b) a persistence lower bound for U_t(H) until coverage.\n\nLower bound blueprint under random-k smoothing (toward Ω(log k0) unconditionally)\n- Goal. Show that without structural constraints on OPT(·), randomizing k cannot beat Θ(log k0) in expectation over k (matching Corollary 14) by constructing a dataset with Δ(k)=1 on a 1−o(1) fraction of k in [k0,2k0), so s(k)=k−1 almost always and the per-k MRS bound averages to Θ(log k0).\n- Plan. Adapt the Arthur–Vassilvitskii family to a windowed construction: arrange a sequence of “micro” plateaus of length 1 by calibrating radii so OPT_{k−1}/OPT_k ≈ 1 + Θ(1/ln k0) for most k, forcing short plateaus and ensuring that the log branch contributes ≈ ln(2m/(L−1))≈ ln m at almost every k. This makes the global average ≳ c ln k0. I will work out the parameterization and the window-localization of their Lemma 4.1 argument in the next round.\n\nExamples and sanity checks\n- Where balanced split helps. Take m large and L ≈ m^0.4 (so ln L ≈ 0.4 ln m). Then the hybrid term gives ≈ (m ln L)/L ≈ m^0.6 ln m; the balanced-split tail gives ≈ (m/L)·const ≈ m^0.6, shaving a factor Θ(ln m) in the tail, while the log piece remains comparable. The min-of-four will pick the balanced split in such regimes.\n- Plateau-level probability. For any I with L≥α m and η=1/2, c=2, the remark after Cor. 9 yields P[ALG/OPT ≤ 2·B_I] ≥ 1/4−O(1/L), B_I ≤ 2·C_bi(1+2/(α e))+O(1/L). This gives a stronger (≈25%) success mass than the 1% global instantiation, at the cost of only plateau-local mixing.\n\nNext steps (verifiable)\n1) Modify Corollaries 11–12 to include the balanced-split branch (τ=⌊L/2⌋) in the minimum (min-of-four), with the existing constants from Corollary 17; keep the L≥3 caveat.\n2) Insert the per-k cautionary remark after Corollary 11 (or in a “Remarks” subsection) to prevent future misuse of plateau averages as per-k bounds.\n3) Heavy coverage: formalize the “outside mass” inequality under λ-separation and derive explicit β,c=Ω(1), then state and curate the expected-collision lemma as a conditional result; prepare to apply Freedman for high-probability.\n4) Lower bound: specify an explicit instance whose windowed OPT-profile enforces L_j=1 for most k in [k0,2k0), then adapt the AV07 lower-bound summation to the uniform-k average, yielding an Ω(log k0) lower bound for the random-k experiment.\n\nWhy these are incremental and auditable\n- The min-of-four integration and the per-k caution are mechanical and locally verifiable.\n- The heavy-coverage lemma isolates explicit parameters (β, α, S_H, inf U_t(H)) and converts them into a clear expected-collision bound; the remaining geometric step will be stated precisely and proved.\n- The lower-bound blueprint follows established constructions; localizing them to the random-k window is a concrete, checkable task.\n"}
