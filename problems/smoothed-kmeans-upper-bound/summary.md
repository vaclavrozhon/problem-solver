Both provers developed a dyadic “plateau” approach to bound E_{k∼U([k0,2k0))}[ALG(k)/OPT(k)] using the Makarychev–Reddy–Shan (2020) bi-criteria oversampling guarantee. They define 2-plateaus (OPT(k) within a factor 2) and show a per-plateau averaged bound: for a plateau starting at m of length L, the k-means++ average ratio is O(1 + ln(2m/L)) (constants from MRS). A per-k formulation via s(k):=min{s:OPT(s)≤2OPT(k)} and Δ(k)=k−s(k) gives E[ALG(k)] ≤ 10·min{2+1/(2e)+ln(2s/Δ), 1 + s/(e(Δ−1))}·OPT(k) for Δ≥1 (Δ=0 falls back to O(ln k)). Consequences: long plateaus (L ≥ m / polylog m) yield O(log log k0) averages; but many short plateaus can force only the trivial O(log k0) bound, so extra structure (or a “heavy-coverage” high‑probability lemma) is needed for an unconditional improvement.

## round-0002 — model summary — 2025-08-27T18:54:16.798946Z
Round recap: Developed a “hybrid” plateau-averaging lemma that combines both MRS branches to give explicit, checkable plateau averages. For a factor-2 plateau I=[m,m+L) the authors show
E_{k∈I} E_++[ALG_k/OPT_k] ≤ 2·C_bi·min{Ā,B̄} + C_fix(ln m + O(1))/L,
with Ā = 2 + 1/(2e) + ln(2m) − ln((L−1)!)/(L−1) (≤ 3 + 1/(2e) + ln(2m/(L−1))) and
B̄ = 1 + (2 + 1/(2e) + ln(2m))/(L−1) + (m/(e(L−1)))·H_{L−2}.
This yields a two‑regime consolidation (logarithmic branch vs. large‑Δ branch) giving O(1) in both natural regimes, an explicit plateau quantile/probability bound (convertible via Markov; e.g. L ≥ 101·m gives ≈98% on that plateau), and a strengthened global decomposition summing per‑plateau min terms. Also advanced a micro‑lemma toward heavy‑coverage: expected heavy collisions ≤ O(k1/R) under scale separation R ≥ k^C. Verifier: partial success. Cited: prover-02.out.json.

## round-0003 — model summary — 2025-08-27T19:44:49.694910Z
Round 0003 consolidated the plateau-averaging machinery and produced several immediately usable corollaries and a clear plan for advancing heavy-coverage and lower bounds. Key technical fixes: the monotonicity lemma is now present (closing a gap in Theorem 2) and Theorem 3's tunable τ-split correctly handles the Δ=1 endpoint and the harmonic tail. Two practical corollaries were proposed: an optimized-τ (min-of-two) plateau bound with explicit constants (log vs hybrid/m/L regimes) and a global min-of-two aggregation across plateaus. A concrete 1%–probability guarantee was derived under a single long-plateau condition with numeric instantiations (e.g., C_bi=5). Finally, a micro-lemma bounds expected heavy-cluster collisions under a β-persistence hypothesis; the next technical task is to derive β-persistence from OPT-scale separation.

## round-0004 — model summary — 2025-08-27T19:53:06.658788Z
This round produced several checkable refinements and concrete instantiations. Key technical additions: a new τ := ⌊m/ln L⌋ branch that replaces the (m ln L)/L hybrid term by (m(1+ln ln L))/L (tightening intermediate regimes); a global per-plateau min-of-three envelope (pure-log, τ=1 hybrid, τ=⌊m/ln L⌋); an optional balanced-split corollary (τ=⌊L/2⌋) for midrange L; explicit numeric constants when C_bi=C_fix=5 (e.g., E[...] ≤ 35 + 10·min{ln^+(2m/(L−1)), (m ln L)/L} + 5·(ln m)/L); a concrete ≥1% probability instantiation; and progress on heavy-coverage: a pathwise bound H_t(H_cov) ≤ 5·∑OPT1 and conversion to conditional collision probabilities, plus a special-case metric-separation lemma (λ≥10) that gives high-probability coverage-before-collisions and O(ln(1/ε)) final cost under oversampling. A lower-bound blueprint (heavy simplex + light singletons) aims to produce Ω(log k0) averaged lower bounds under random-k smoothing. Files used: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json.

## round-0005 — model summary — 2025-08-27T20:00:51.449935Z
Round 0005 audit: two independent checks validated the new τ≈m/ln L branch, the min-of-three per-plateau envelope, and the explicit-constant instantiation (C_bi=C_fix=5). Both provers flagged the same minor edge-case: the third branch involving (m(1+ln ln L))/L should be restricted to L≥3 to avoid negative ln ln L for L=2. They proposed several direct, checkable global additions: (i) a global min-of-three aggregation across factor-2 plateaus with explicit constants (K0=35,K1=10,K2=5), (ii) an endpoint-sum cap lemma (endpoint contribution ≤ ln(2k0)), (iii) a long-plateau global corollary giving constant average on large plateaus, and (iv) an explicit ≥1% probability guarantee using η=0.98, c=2. Prover-02 also supplied an unconditional worst-case lemma recovering E[ALG/OPT] = O(1)+O(ln k0) and a heavy-coverage Lemma that reduces collision-control to proving a persistence lower bound inf_{t<τ} U_t(H) ≥ c·S_H under scale/geometric separation. Main remaining work: formalize that persistence bound to complete the heavy-coverage program. Files: prover-01.out.json and prover-02.out.json (Round 0005). Verifier: partial success.

## round-0006 — model summary — 2025-08-27T20:10:45.434930Z
Round 0006 summary: Both provers audited output.md (no blocking correctness issues) and added multiple checkable corollaries and lemmas. Per-plateau: two new τ-instantiations — balanced-split τ=⌊L/2⌋ and constant-tail τ=⌊(L−1)/e⌋ — with explicit safe constants producing midrange improvements and clean O(m/L) tails. Global mixing: a multi-plateau ≥1% probability corollary (P ≥ 0.01·γ − O(γ/min_j L_j)) and a quantified O(log log k0) mixture for plateaus L_j ≥ m_j/(ln k0)^σ giving a γ-weighted term ≈ 2 C_bi (a+1+ln 2 + σ ln ln k0). Heavy-coverage: a rigorous expectation-form lemma bounds expected heavy-collisions by (α/(β+1))·k1·(S_H / inf_t U_t(H)), reducing the remaining task to proving persistence (a lower bound on uncovered heavy mass); provers propose to obtain this via λ-separation, which would yield collisions O(k1/λ^2). A discrete-smoothness ⇒ long-plateau lemma ties per-step multiplicative smoothness to plateau length L ≳ ln2/δ, enabling the 1% mixing guarantee under mild smoothness. Verifier: partial success.

## round-0007 — model summary — 2025-08-27T20:21:36.474000Z
Round 0007 produced a simple, unconditional two-level Markov argument that gives a plateau-agnostic constant-mass guarantee over the whole window [k0,2k0): for any c≥1, P_{k,++}[ALG_k/OPT_k ≤ c^2·B_max] ≥ (1−1/c)^2, and taking c=2 yields a 25% joint probability. Using Corollary 11/12 and the fixed-k bound, the authors instantiate explicit global constants: with C_bi=C_fix=5 and K0=35,K1=10,K2=5 they obtain B_max ≤ 45 + 12.5·ln(2k0) and hence ALG/OPT ≤ 180 + 50·ln(2k0) with probability ≥1/4. Prover-02 added structural corollaries: power-law decay gives a constant plateau average; a median (η=1/2) instantiation yields a 25% plateau-level guarantee; and a discrete 1/k-smoothness hypothesis implies an O_A(1) global average. The main remaining technical gap is proving the heavy-coverage persistence denominator to upgrade expected bounds to high-probability. Verifier: partial success.
