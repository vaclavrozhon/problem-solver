  "summary_md": "In this round, two significant lemmas were proposed: Lemma 1 establishes a constant-factor cap on changes in monochromatic runs at a fixed bit level, while Lemma 2 asserts that a matched boundary only affects a constant number of nearby bit levels. Both lemmas are crucial for proving the overall lower bound but require rigorous justification. Initial test attempts with small cases (n=8 and n=16) were conducted to analyze the effects of swaps, and the potential function \u03a6(A) was explored to track changes. The relationship between counting arguments and the potential function was also examined, highlighting the need for coherence in the proof. Overall, the direction of the research is promising, but further rigor is essential for advancement.",

    "What rigorous justifications can be provided for Lemmas 1 and 2?",
    "How can the test attempts be expanded to include larger cases for more robust validation?",
