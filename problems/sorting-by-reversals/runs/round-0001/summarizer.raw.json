Two complementary threads produced rigorous local bounds: a per-level constant-factor cap on B_j change in one step (prover-01 gave a factor-4 bound; prover-02 refined the argument to c=7 via careful edge counting), and a size-sensitive bound Δ_j ≤ C·∑_p min{1, s(p)/L_j} tying level-j progress to swapped-pair sizes. A dyadic alignment lemma shows any cut index is “useful” for only O(log n) levels. These tools recover the known Ω(log n) lower bound but do not yet yield Ω(d^2)=Ω(log^2 n): the missing ingredient is a robust cross-level scarcity (only O(1) levels can get constant-factor progress in one step). Next steps target a “home-level” charging argument and small-n enumeration to validate constants.
