Both lemmas are crucial for proving the overall lower bound but require rigorous justification. Initial test attempts with small cases (n=8 and n=16) were conducted to analyze the effects of swaps, and the potential function Φ(A) was explored to track changes. The relationship between counting arguments and the potential function was also examined, highlighting the need for coherence in the proof.
