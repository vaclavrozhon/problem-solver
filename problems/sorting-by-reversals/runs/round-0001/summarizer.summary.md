This round formalized that our single-step model = PBT (parallel adjacent block transpositions, JOP arXiv:2311.08727) and set a concrete potential Φ(A)=∑_j D_j(A) with D_j(A)=|log2 B_j(A)−(d−j)|; for bit-reversal A0 this Φ(A0)=Θ(d^2). Two complementary threads produced rigorous local bounds: a per-level constant-factor cap on B_j change in one step (prover-01 gave a factor-4 bound; prover-02 refined the argument to c=7 via careful edge counting), and a size-sensitive bound Δ_j ≤ C·∑_p min{1, s(p)/L_j} tying level-j progress to swapped-pair sizes. A dyadic alignment lemma shows any cut index is “useful” for only O(log n) levels. These tools recover the known Ω(log n) lower bound but do not yet yield Ω(d^2)=Ω(log^2 n): the missing ingredient is a robust cross-level scarcity (only O(1) levels can get constant-factor progress in one step). Next steps target a “home-level” charging argument and small-n enumeration to validate constants. Citations: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json; Jelínek–Opler–Pekárek (arXiv:2311.08727).
