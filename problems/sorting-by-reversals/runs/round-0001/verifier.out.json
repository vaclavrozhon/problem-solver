  "feedback_md": "High-level assessment and triage\n- Both reports correctly identify the model as PBT (parallel adjacent block transpositions). That alignment with Jel\u00ednek\u2013Opler\u2013Pek\u00e1rek (JOP) is valuable and gives context (O(log^2 n) upper bound, only \u03a9(log n) general LB known).\n- The end-point calibration is solid: for n=2^d and bit-reversal A0, B_j(A0)=2^{j+1} and for sorted A*, B_j(A*)=2^{d\u2212j}. The potential \u03a6(A)=\u03a3_j |log_2 B_j(A)\u2212(d\u2212j)| is \u0398(d^2) at A0.\n- The most useful rigor you can bank now is a clean, general per-level multiplicative cap: in any single PBT step, B_j can change by only a constant factor. We can prove B_j(A\u2032)\u22644 B_j(A) and B_j(A)\u22644 B_j(A\u2032) for every j. This is stronger (and cleaner) than the c=7 claim in Report 02 and does not rely on the flawed \u201cuseful boundary\u201d refinement in Report 01.\n\nWhat is correct and kept\n1) Model \u2194 PBT: correct. No need to invoke empty blocks; define a PBT step as swapping disjoint adjacent block pairs.\n2) Endpoints: B_j(A0)=2^{j+1}, B_j(A*)=2^{d\u2212j}. Hence \u03a6(A0)=\u0398(d^2).\n3) Per-level cap (correct proof): If a swapped pair\u2019s union contains no j-boundary in the current array A, then all three affected indices (left outer, inner, right outer) remain non-toggling at level j. Therefore only pairs whose union contains at least one j-boundary in A can affect B_j. Because the unions of swapped pairs are disjoint, the number of such pairs is at most |T_j(A)|=B_j(A)\u22121. Each such pair contributes at most 3 to |\u0394B_j|. Hence |\u0394B_j|\u22643(B_j\u22121), implying B_j(A\u2032)\u22644B_j(A) and, symmetrically, B_j(A)\u22644B_j(A\u2032).\n4) Dyadic alignment for A0: For a set S of cut indices and G_j the j-boundary set in A0, \u03a3_j |S\u2229G_j| = \u03a3_{i\u2208S}(1+v_2(i)) \u2264 |S|(1+\u230alog_2(n\u22121)\u230b). This is a clean combinatorial fact that will be useful for any argument tied to the specific input A0.\n\nIssues, corrections, and nonrigorous parts\n- Report 01 Claim 4.1 (\u201cuseful boundaries\u201d U_j): Not correct as stated. The post-step j-color at a changed index depends on elements imported from potentially far positions; local adjacency to T_j(A) is insufficient to preclude toggling. Do not use this claim. Fortunately, the multiplicative cap is salvageable via the disjointness-of-unions argument above, yielding a sharper c=4 instead of c=7.\n- Report 02 \u201cc=7\u201d proof: The injection |Q_j|\u2264B_j\u22121 was stated with Q_j defined unclearly. The correct notion is: Q_j = {pairs whose union contains at least one j-boundary in the current array A}. Then |Q_j|\u2264B_j\u22121 holds. With at most 3 toggles per such pair, c=4 follows; c=7 is unnecessarily weak.\n- Report 02 \u201csize lemma\u201d \u0394_j \u2264 C \u03a3_p min{1, s(p)/L_j} is false deterministically. You can choose many short pairs whose central boundaries land on j-gridlines, yielding \u0394_j \u2243 (n/L_j) while RHS \u2243 (n/L_j^2). Replace this with a scale-aware charging (see Next steps below).\n- Report 02 \u201cedge-to-level charging\u201d using E_j as fixed L_j-gridlines is only valid at the initial array A0. After the first step, j-boundaries are not constrained to those gridlines. Use it only to analyze the first step from A0, or rephrase it in terms of T_j(A) of the current array (which is dynamic and harder to control combinatorially).\n\nGuidance and next steps (concrete targets)\n1) Tighten the per-level cap to factor 2 if possible. Suggested route: For each pair that intersects T_j(A), charge each toggling edge to a unique j-boundary lying inside the pair\u2019s union (in A or A\u2032) in such a way that each boundary is charged O(1) times. This would give |\u0394B_j| \u2264 c\u2032\u00b7|T_j(A)\u222aT_j(A\u2032)| and plausibly c\u2032=1 or 2, hence a factor-2 change cap for B_j. Even c\u2032=2 is a big improvement.\n2) Necessity of many central matches: Formalize that to reduce B_j by a constant factor from A with B_j runs, one must match \u0398(B_j) pairs whose inner boundary coincides with (or is extremely near and structured relative to) j-run boundaries in A; outer-boundary hits are not enough. This \u201cdemand\u201d lemma should explicitly count required central-boundary matches and be insensitive to local cancellations.\n3) Cross-level scarcity via home levels: Partition swapped pairs by total size s(p) and define a home level h(p) with L_{h(p)}\u2248s(p). Prove that constant-factor progress at level j requires \u03a3_{p: h(p)=j} contribution \u03a9(1). Because \u03a3_p s(p)\u2264n, deduce that only O(1) distinct levels can get factor-\u22652 progress in the same step. Start with the restricted equal-scale case (all blocks within \u00d72 of a common L), which should be tractable and already yields an \u03a9(log^2 n) lower bound for that restricted class.\n4) Use the A0 structure aggressively: The dyadic characterization of G_j enables precise statements about central-boundary alignment. Try to prove that the set of central boundaries used by a step cannot align with G_j for many j simultaneously, once you require \u0398(B_j) distinct central hits for each such j.\n5) Computational probe (n=16,32): Exhaustively/randomly sample partitions and count, per step, how many levels achieve a factor-\u22652 change in B_j. This can sharpen constants and suggest the true per-step active-level cap.\n\nWhat is curated now\n- We include in output.md: (i) model\u2194PBT equivalence; (ii) endpoint B_j counts and \u03a6(A0)=\u0398(d^2); (iii) per-level factor-4 cap with a clean proof; (iv) the dyadic alignment lemma for A0.\n- We explicitly exclude Claim 4.1 (\u201cuseful boundaries\u201d) and the min{1, s/L_j} size lemma; both need repair before inclusion.",
  "new_notes_md": "Setting and notation\n- Input size n=2^d. The specific permutation A_0 is bit-reversal order of [0,\u2026,n\u22121]. For j\u2208{0,\u2026,d\u22121} we color elements by their j-th bit and denote by B_j(A) the number of monochromatic runs (contiguous blocks of equal j-bit) in the array A. Let T_j(A)\u2286{1,\u2026,n\u22121} be the set of j-run boundary indices (|T_j(A)|=B_j(A)\u22121). We consider one-step operations that swap a family of disjoint adjacent interval pairs in parallel.\n- Our model of one step coincides with PBT (parallel adjacent block transpositions). One step chooses disjoint pairs (L_k,R_k) of adjacent contiguous intervals and swaps every chosen pair simultaneously.\n\nEndpoint calibration (bit-reversal vs sorted)\n- For A_0 (bit-reversal), B_j(A_0)=2^{j+1}. For the fully sorted order A_* = [0,1,\u2026,n\u22121], B_j(A_*)=2^{d\u2212j}. Consequently, the potential \u03a6(A):=\u03a3_{j=0}^{d\u22121} |log_2 B_j(A) \u2212 (d\u2212j)| satisfies \u03a6(A_0)=\u0398(d^2) and \u03a6(A_*)=0.\n\nLocality of changes per pair and a safe per-level cap\n- A single swapped pair (L,R) can alter adjacency only at three indices: the left outer boundary before L, the inner boundary between L and R, and the right outer boundary after R. For a fixed level j, if the union L\u222aR contains no j-boundary of the current array A, then all three affected adjacencies are between same colors both before and after; hence this pair produces no change in B_j.\n- Therefore only pairs whose union contains at least one element of T_j(A) can affect B_j. Because the pair unions are disjoint, the number of such pairs is at most |T_j(A)|=B_j(A)\u22121. Each such pair contributes at most 3 to |B_j(A\u2032)\u2212B_j(A)|. Hence for every j and every PBT step A\u2192A\u2032,\n  |B_j(A\u2032) \u2212 B_j(A)| \u2264 3(B_j(A) \u2212 1),\n  which implies the multiplicative cap B_j(A\u2032) \u2264 4\u00b7B_j(A) and B_j(A) \u2264 4\u00b7B_j(A\u2032). In particular, |\u0394 log_2 B_j| \u2264 2 per step.\n\nDyadic alignment for A_0\n- Let G_j denote the j-run boundary set in A_0. Then G_j = { i\u2208{1,\u2026,n\u22121} : 2^{d\u22121\u2212j} divides i }.

We avoid using U_j.\n- A claimed \u201csize lemma\u201d of the form \u0394_j \u2264 C\u00b7\u03a3_p min{1, s(p)/L_j} is false deterministically. Short pairs can be aligned to j-gridlines so that \u0394_j \u224d n/L_j while the RHS is \u224d n/L_j^2. Any valid size-sensitive bound must use a different aggregation (see Next steps).\n- Edge-to-level weighting that relies on fixed dyadic gridlines E_j holds at A_0 but not after the array evolves; after one step the j-boundaries are no longer constrained to those gridlines.\n\nNext steps (program)\n1) Try to sharpen the per-level cap to factor 2: Show |B_j(A\u2032)\u2212B_j(A)| \u2264 c\u00b7|T_j(A)\u222aT_j(A\u2032)| with small c (ideally c=1 or 2) by charging every toggling edge to a unique j-boundary contained in the union of the pair in either A or A\u2032.\n2) Demand for central matches: Prove that achieving a constant-factor decrease of B_j in one step requires \u0398(B_j) central-boundary alignments (inner boundaries of swapped pairs) with j-run boundaries of A; outer-boundary hits alone cannot effect global coalescence. Make this precise and robust to local cancellations.\n3) Cross-level scarcity via \u201chome levels\u201d: For each pair p of total size s(p), assign h(p) with L_{h(p)}\u2248s(p). Prove that constant-factor progress at level j needs \u03a3_{p: h(p)=j} \u03a9(1) contribution. Since \u03a3_p s(p) \u2264 n and the sets {p: h(p)=j} are disjoint across j, only O(1) levels can make factor-\u22652 progress in the same step. First prove the equal-scale special case (all pairs have sizes within \u00d72 of some L), which should already yield an \u03a9(log^2 n) lower bound for that restricted class.\n4) Use the dyadic structure of G_j at A_0 to formalize a \u201ccentral-boundary alignment trade-off\u201d across levels: matched central boundaries that effect progress for one j are largely incompatible with those needed for many other j due to disjointness and dyadic spacing.\n5) Perform small-n experiments (n=16,32) to estimate the maximal number of levels that can experience \u22652\u00d7 change in B_j in one step and to guide constants.\n",

  "new_outputs_md": "Statements and proofs curated so far\n\nTheorem 1 (Model equivalence to PBT). A single step of the model (swapping a family of disjoint adjacent interval pairs in parallel) is exactly a parallel block transposition (PBT) step: a product of disjoint adjacent block transpositions.\nProof. A step chooses disjoint adjacent pairs (L_k,R_k) of intervals and swaps each pair simultaneously, leaving all other positions untouched. This is precisely a product of disjoint adjacent block transpositions. Conversely, any product of disjoint adjacent block transpositions can be realized by choosing those pairs. \u220e\n\nTheorem 2 (Endpoint run-counts). Let n=2^d and A_0 be the bit-reversal permutation of [0,\u2026,n\u22121]. For j\u2208{0,\u2026,d\u22121}:\n- B_j(A_0)=2^{j+1}.\n- For the fully sorted order A_*=[0,1,\u2026,n\u22121], B_j(A_*)=2^{d\u2212j}.\nConsequently, with D_j(A):=|log_2 B_j(A) \u2212 (d\u2212j)|, one has \u03a3_{j=0}^{d\u22121} D_j(A_0)=\u0398(d^2) and \u03a3_{j=0}^{d\u22121} D_j(A_*)=0.\nProof. In A_0, the j-bit of the value at position i equals the (d\u22121\u2212j)-th bit of i; thus along positions 0,\u2026,n\u22121 this bit is constant on runs of length 2^{d\u22121\u2212j} and alternates every such block, giving exactly 2^{j+1} runs. In A_*, the j-bit is constant on blocks of length 2^j and alternates every 2^j positions, yielding 2^{d\u2212j} runs. The \u0398(d^2) sum follows from \u03a3_{j=0}^{d\u22121} |2j+1\u2212d| = \u0398(d^2) by symmetry around (d\u22121)/2. \u220e\n\nTheorem 3 (Per-level factor-4 cap per step). For any array A, any j, and any single PBT step A\u2192A\u2032, we have B_j(A\u2032) \u2264 4\u00b7B_j(A) and B_j(A) \u2264 4\u00b7B_j(A\u2032). Equivalently, |log_2 B_j| changes by at most 2 in one step.\nProof. Let T_j(A) be the set of j-boundary indices in A. Consider a swapped pair (L,R). If the union U=L\u222aR contains no index from T_j(A), then the j-color is constant throughout U, so the three adjacencies that can change (left outer boundary of U, inner boundary between L and R, and right outer boundary of U) all remain between equal colors both before and after; hence this pair produces no change in B_j. Therefore only pairs whose union intersects T_j(A) can change B_j. Because the unions of the swapped pairs are disjoint, the number of such pairs is at most |T_j(A)|=B_j(A)\u22121. Each such pair affects at most the three indices mentioned, so it can change B_j by at most 3. Hence |B_j(A\u2032)\u2212B_j(A)| \u2264 3(B_j(A)\u22121), which implies B_j(A\u2032) \u2264 4\u00b7B_j(A). Applying the same argument to the inverse step A\u2032\u2192A gives B_j(A) \u2264 4\u00b7B_j(A\u2032). \u220e\n\nTheorem 4 (Dyadic alignment for A_0). Let G_j\u2286{1,\u2026,n\u22121} be the set of j-run boundary indices in A_0. Then G_j = { i : 2^{d\u22121\u2212j} divides i }. For any set S\u2286{1,\u2026,n\u22121} (e.g., cut positions used in a step),\n  \u03a3_{j=0}^{d\u22121} |S \u2229 G_j| = \u03a3_{i\u2208S} (1 + v_2(i)) \u2264 |S| (1 + \u230alog_2(n\u22121)\u230b).\nProof. In A_0 the j-bit of values is periodic with period 2^{d\u2212j}, so boundaries occur exactly at indices i that are multiples of 2^{d\u22121\u2212j}. For fixed i, the set of j with i\u2208G_j has size 1+v_2(i) (the largest \u03c4=v_2(i) yields divisibility by 2^\u03c4). Summing over i\u2208S gives the identity; since v_2(i)\u2264\u230alog_2 i\u230b\u2264\u230alog_2(n\u22121)\u230b, the inequality follows. \u220e",
