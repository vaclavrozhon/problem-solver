• Two key lemmas proposed: Lemma 1 (constant-factor cap on B_j changes) and Lemma 2 (matched boundary affects O(1) levels).
• Both lemmas require rigorous justification to ensure validity.
• Test attempts for small cases (n=8, n=16) are a good start but need theoretical backing.
• Explore the potential function Φ(A) to track changes and establish the lower bound.
• Analyze the counting lower bound's implications for Φ(A) to ensure coherence.
• Overall direction is promising, but rigor is essential for advancing the proof.
