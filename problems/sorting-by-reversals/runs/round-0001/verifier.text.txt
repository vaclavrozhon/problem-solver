  "feedback_md": "The prover's latest round presents two key lemmas aimed at establishing an Omega(log^2 n) lower bound for sorting bit-reversal sequences. However, both lemmas require rigorous justification to ensure their validity. For Lemma 1, the claim that the number of monochromatic runs at a fixed bit level can change by at most a constant multiplicative factor needs to be substantiated with a clear argument or proof. A counterexample should be considered to verify this claim. For Lemma 2, the assertion that a matched boundary only affects O(1) nearby bit levels must also be carefully examined, as it could potentially fail in certain arrangements. The proposed test attempts are a good start, but they should be complemented with theoretical analysis to strengthen the argument. Additionally, the relationship between the counting lower bound and the potential function Φ(A) needs further exploration to ensure that the established bounds are coherent and applicable to the model. Overall, while the direction is promising, the rigor and justification of the lemmas are critical for advancing the proof.",
