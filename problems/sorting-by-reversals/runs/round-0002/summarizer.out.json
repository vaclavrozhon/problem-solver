  "summary_md": "This round produced two complementary technical advances and a clear programmatic path. Prover-01 introduced the toggle-locality identity: for any single PBT step with changed-adjacency set S, B_j(A')\u2212B_j(A)=|T_j(A')\u2229S|\u2212|T_j(A)\u2229S|, and the immediate one-sided corollary Decrease_j \u2264 |T_j(A)\u2229S| (and symmetrically for increases). It also restated the A_0 alignment count \u03a3_j |S\u2229G_j| = \u03a3_{i\u2208S}(1+v_2(i)) (weighted form included). Prover-02 fixed a proof gap and proved a tight per-pair \u00b12 contribution bound, yielding a per-level factor-3 cap B_j(A') \u2264 3 B_j(A). Both files give a clean equal-scale first-step scarcity claim from A_0: when all pairs have size \u2248L, only O(1) adjacent dyadic levels near L can undergo constant-factor change. Remaining gaps: extending equal-scale scarcity beyond the first step and proving a robust home-level charging lemma. Files relied on: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json.",

    "Toggle-locality identity: for a single step with changed-index set S, B_j(A')\u2212B_j(A)=|T_j(A')\u2229S|\u2212|T_j(A)\u2229S|; hence Decrease_j \u2264 |T_j(A)\u2229S| and Increase_j \u2264 |S\\T_j(A)|.",
    "Alignment counting at A_0: \u03a3_{j} |S\u2229G_j| = \u03a3_{i\u2208S}(1+v_2(i)), with a weighted variant for tailored level weights.",
    "Per-pair \u00b12 bound: each matched pair contributes at most \u00b12 to \u0394B_j, which gives the factor-3 per-level cap B_j(A') \u2264 3\u00b7B_j(A) (and the reverse).",
    "Equal-scale first-step scarcity (from A_0): when all pairs have total size s\u2208[L,2L], only O(1) dyadic levels with L_j\u2248L can change by a constant factor, and |\u0394B_j| \u2264 2\u00b7(n/s).",
    "Clarified failure: the earlier \u201cuseful-boundary adjacency\u201d heuristic is false; only indices in S can flip j-boundary membership and only those in T_j(A) can cause decreases.",
    "Quantitative limits noted: counting |S| alone is insufficient because each changed index can affect O(log n) levels via v_2(i); weighting/commensurability constraints are needed for stronger bounds."

  "next_questions": [
    "Curate and publish the toggle-locality identity + Corollary and the per-pair \u00b12 lemmas (factor-3 cap) into output.md to replace the flawed wording and close the proof gap.",
    "Prove the equal-scale, grid-aligned scarcity claim rigorously (bound |S\u2229G_j|/B_j off-scale by o(1)) and then generalize to near-alignment via residue-class averaging to obtain an O(1) active-level cap per equal-scale step.",
    "Develop and prove a home-level charging lemma (charge pairs to their dyadic home scale) and run experiments for n=64,128 to test the O(1) active-level hypothesis and calibrate constants."
