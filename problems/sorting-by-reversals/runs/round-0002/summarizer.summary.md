This round produced two complementary technical advances and a clear programmatic path. Prover-01 introduced the toggle-locality identity: for any single PBT step with changed-adjacency set S, B_j(A')−B_j(A)=|T_j(A')∩S|−|T_j(A)∩S|, and the immediate one-sided corollary Decrease_j ≤ |T_j(A)∩S| (and symmetrically for increases). It also restated the A_0 alignment count Σ_j |S∩G_j| = Σ_{i∈S}(1+v_2(i)) (weighted form included). Prover-02 fixed a proof gap and proved a tight per-pair ±2 contribution bound, yielding a per-level factor-3 cap B_j(A') ≤ 3 B_j(A). Both files give a clean equal-scale first-step scarcity claim from A_0: when all pairs have size ≈L, only O(1) adjacent dyadic levels near L can undergo constant-factor change. Remaining gaps: extending equal-scale scarcity beyond the first step and proving a robust home-level charging lemma. Files relied on: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json.
