  "summary_md": "This round produced two complementary technical advances and a clear programmatic path. Prover-01 introduced the toggle-locality identity: for any single PBT step with changed-adjacency set S, B_j(A')−B_j(A)=|T_j(A')∩S|−|T_j(A)∩S|, and the immediate one-sided corollary Decrease_j ≤ |T_j(A)∩S| (and symmetrically for increases). It also restated the A_0 alignment count Σ_j |S∩G_j| = Σ_{i∈S}(1+v_2(i)) (weighted form included). Prover-02 fixed a proof gap and proved a tight per-pair ±2 contribution bound, yielding a per-level factor-3 cap B_j(A') ≤ 3 B_j(A). Both files give a clean equal-scale first-step scarcity claim from A_0: when all pairs have size ≈L, only O(1) adjacent dyadic levels near L can undergo constant-factor change. Remaining gaps: extending equal-scale scarcity beyond the first step and proving a robust home-level charging lemma. Files relied on: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json.",

    "Alignment counting at A_0: Σ_{j} |S∩G_j| = Σ_{i∈S}(1+v_2(i)), with a weighted variant for tailored level weights.",
    "Per-pair ±2 bound: each matched pair contributes at most ±2 to ΔB_j, which gives the factor-3 per-level cap B_j(A') ≤ 3·B_j(A) (and the reverse).",
    "Equal-scale first-step scarcity (from A_0): when all pairs have total size s∈[L,2L], only O(1) dyadic levels with L_j≈L can change by a constant factor, and |ΔB_j| ≤ 2·(n/s).",
    "Clarified failure: the earlier “useful-boundary adjacency” heuristic is false; only indices in S can flip j-boundary membership and only those in T_j(A) can cause decreases.",
    "Quantitative limits noted: counting |S| alone is insufficient because each changed index can affect O(log n) levels via v_2(i); weighting/commensurability constraints are needed for stronger bounds."

    "Curate and publish the toggle-locality identity + Corollary and the per-pair ±2 lemmas (factor-3 cap) into output.md to replace the flawed wording and close the proof gap.",
    "Prove the equal-scale, grid-aligned scarcity claim rigorously (bound |S∩G_j|/B_j off-scale by o(1)) and then generalize to near-alignment via residue-class averaging to obtain an O(1) active-level cap per equal-scale step.",
    "Develop and prove a home-level charging lemma (charge pairs to their dyadic home scale) and run experiments for n=64,128 to test the O(1) active-level hypothesis and calibrate constants."
