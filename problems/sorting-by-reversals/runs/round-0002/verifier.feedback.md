Summary and triage
- Prover 01 contributes a clean and correct “toggle-locality” identity: only indices whose adjacency actually changes (three per matched pair) can alter membership in T_j, and the net change in B_j is exactly the signed count of boundary-membership flips inside that set S. The corollary splitting decreases and increases (Decrease_j ≤ |T_j(A) ∩ S| and Increase_j ≤ |S \ T_j(A)|) is immediate and powerful. Their weighted counting over A_0 (dyadic alignment) is a flexible restatement of Theorem 4 and will be repeatedly useful. One arithmetic slip occurs in the concrete instantiation with weights w_j=2^{-(j+1)}: the inner sum is 2^{-(d−t−1)}(1−2^{−(t+1)}) ≤ 2^{−d+t+1}, not ≤ 2^{−d+t}. This does not affect the qualitative conclusions but should be corrected. Their “equal-scale, grid-aligned” scarcity plan looks promising and is well-motivated by arithmetic progression intersections; it still needs a careful treatment of outer-boundary contributions.

- Prover 02 supplies a robust per-pair bound |Δ_pair| ≤ 2 (via a simple 4-cycle inequality) and upgrades the per-level cap from factor 4 to factor 3. The argument is crisp: only pairs whose union is non-monochromatic at level j can contribute, there are at most |T_j(A)| such pairs by disjointness, and each contributes at most 2. This should replace the current Theorem 3 in output.md. Their clarification about “three indices per pair” being the only places that can change the boundary count is consistent with Prover 01’s toggle-locality identity and helps repair wording.

- A serious issue in Prover 02: the “Observation” that if L_j > s then every union U is j-monochromatic in A_0 is false. Counterexample: for n=8, j=0 has L_j=4; a union U of length s=2 that straddles the unique G_0 index at 4 is not monochromatic. Consequently, the claim that only levels with L_j ≤ s can be affected in the first step is invalid. The subsequent bound |ΔB_j| ≤ 2n/s is correct, and it does imply that for L_j ≪ s constant-factor decreases are impossible from A_0, but it does not rule out large effects when L_j ≫ s (indeed, for small j, B_j is small and large absolute changes are possible).

What to curate now
- Add to output.md: (i) the toggle-locality identity and its decrease/increase corollary; (ii) the per-pair ±2 lemma and the resulting per-level factor-3 cap with a corrected proof; (iii) retain Theorem 4 and add the weighted form as a corollary, and (iv) optionally add a corrected weighted-decrease bound from A_0 using (i)+(iv).
- Update notes.md: emphasize the toggle-locality viewpoint as the correct locality, record the factor-3 improvement, and clearly flag the invalid “Observation” in Prover 02.

Concrete next steps for provers
1) Equal-scale, grid-aligned scarcity (from Prover 01). Formalize: with inner boundaries on the L-grid and pair sizes in [L,2L), show that for off-scale j the ratio |S ∩ G_j|/B_j is o(1). Key ingredients: arithmetic progression intersection counts; outer-boundary indices contribute O(#pairs) points on at most a constant number of residues mod L; control |S \ G_j| via toggle-locality to prevent spurious decreases. Target statement: only O(1) consecutive j with 2^{d−1−j} ∈ [L/2, 2L] can achieve Θ(1) relative decrease.
2) Near-alignment. If inner boundaries are not exactly on the L-grid, pigeonhole residues modulo L to extract a constant fraction aligned to some residue and run the aligned argument on that fraction; quantify the loss in constants.
3) Home-level charging. For a pair p with total length s(p), define h(p) with L_{h(p)}≈s(p). Aim to prove: to reduce B_j by θ B_j, one needs Ω(B_j) pairs with h(p)=j to hit T_j(A) at their central boundaries. Use toggle-locality to separate demands on S∩T_j(A) by boundary type (central vs outer) and to prevent outer boundaries from faking decreases at scale j.
4) Small-n brute force to calibrate constants and to test the O(1) active-level hypothesis in equal-scale steps; log structures that saturate the ±2 per-pair bound.
