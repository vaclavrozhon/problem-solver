Summary and triage
- Prover 01 contributes a clean and correct “toggle-locality” identity: only indices whose adjacency actually changes (three per matched pair) can alter membership in T_j, and the net change in B_j is exactly the signed count of boundary-membership flips inside that set S. The corollary splitting decreases and increases (Decrease_j ≤ |T_j(A) ∩ S| and Increase_j ≤ |S \ T_j(A)|) is immediate and powerful. Their weighted counting over A_0 (dyadic alignment) is a flexible restatement of Theorem 4 and will be repeatedly useful. One arithmetic slip occurs in the concrete instantiation with weights w_j=2^{-(j+1)}: the inner sum is 2^{-(d−t−1)}(1−2^{−(t+1)}) ≤ 2^{−d+t+1}, not ≤ 2^{−d+t}. This does not affect the qualitative conclusions but should be corrected. Their “equal-scale, grid-aligned” scarcity plan looks promising and is well-motivated by arithmetic progression intersections; it still needs a careful treatment of outer-boundary contributions.
