Weighted instantiations are available and correct (verifier’s correction applied).\\n\\n### New: a simple per-step “pair-budget” demand bound\\n- Lemma (per-step demand). Let a step use m matched pairs and S its set of changed indices. Then for any fixed bit-level j,\\n  \\\\[\\\\text{Decrease}_j \\\\le |T_j(A)\\\\cap S| \\\\le |S| \\\\le 3m.\\\\]\\n  Proof. Immediate from toggle-locality and that a pair changes at most 3 adjacencies.\\n- Consequence (coarse necessary condition). A constant-fraction decrease at level j in one step, i.e., \\\\(\\\\text{Decrease}_j \\\\ge \\\\theta\\\\,B_j(A)\\\\), forces \\\\(m \\\\ge \\\\tfrac{\\\\theta}{3}\\\\,B_j(A)\\\\). For A=A_0, this is \\\\(m \\\\ge \\\\tfrac{\\\\theta}{3}\\\\,(n/L_j)\\\\). If moreover all total pair sizes lie in [L,2L], then m ≤ n/L, so a constant-fraction decrease at j necessitates \\\\(L_j \\\\gtrsim L\\\\). This recovers the intuitive “only levels at or above the step’s scale can be significantly coarsened” necessary condition.\\n\\nWhy useful here. Although very coarse, this “pair-budget” lower bound is universal (no alignment assumptions) and will be a repeatedly invoked necessary condition when we later combine scale-wise inequalities.\\n\\n### New: an equal-scale, grid-aligned cross-level inequality at A_0\\nWe formalize a clean cross-level bound that leverages alignment to a dyadic grid and will be a base tool for any “phase-by-scale” analysis.\\n\\n- Setting. Let A=A_0. Fix L=2^\\\\ell and consider a step with:\\n  1) all matched pairs having total sizes in [L,2L), and\\n  2) all inner boundaries of the matched pairs at indices divisible by L (i.e., inner boundaries lie on the L-grid).\\n  Let m be the number of pairs; thus m ≤ n/L. Let S be the set of the (at most 3m) changed indices.\\n\\n- Inequality 1 (large-scale weighted bound). For the set of levels with run-length at least L, i.e., \\\\(\\\\{j: L_j\\\\ge L\\\\}\\\\), we have\\n  \\\\[ \\\\sum_{\\\\{j: L_j\\\\ge L\\\\}} \\\\frac{L}{L_j}\\\\,\\\\text{Decrease}_j\\\\;\\\\le\\\\; 2|S|\\\\;\\\\le\\\\;6m\\\\;\\\\le\\\\;\\\\frac{6n}{L}. \\\\]\\n  Proof. From toggle-locality: \\\\(\\\\sum_j \\\\frac{L}{L_j}\\\\,\\\\text{Decrease}_j \\\\le \\\\sum_{i\\\\in S}\\\\sum_{\\\\{j: i\\\\in G_j,\\\\,L_j\\\\ge L\\\\}} \\\\frac{L}{L_j}\\\\). For an index i with 2-adic valuation t = v_2(i), the inner sum is a truncated geometric series \\\\(\\\\sum_{s=\\\\ell}^{t} 2^{\\\\ell-s} \\\\le 2\\\\), and is 0 if t<\\\\ell. Thus the entire sum is ≤ 2|S|.\\n\\n- Inequality 2 (small-scale aggregate fractional bound). For the levels with run-length below L (i.e., \\\\(L_j<L\\\\)), define \\\\(w_j:=1/B_j(A_0)=L_j/n\\\\). Then\\n  \\\\[ \\\\sum_{\\\\{j: L_j<L\\\\}} \\\\frac{\\\\text{Decrease}_j}{B_j(A_0)} \\\\;=\\\\; \\\\sum_{\\\\{j: L_j<L\\\\}} w_j\\\\,\\\\text{Decrease}_j \\\\;\\\\le\\\\; C\\\\,\\\\frac{n}{L}\\\\,\\\\log\\\\frac{n}{L} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\;=\\\\; C\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\log(n/L)}{L}. \\\\]\\n  Proof idea. Toggle-locality gives \\\\(\\\\sum_j w_j\\\\,\\\\text{Decrease}_j \\\\le \\\\sum_{i\\\\in S}\\\\sum_{\\\\{j: i\\\\in G_j\\\\}} w_j\\\\). For A_0, as in the weighted version of Theorem 6, \\\\(\\\\sum_{\\\\{j: i\\\\in G_j\\\\}} w_j = \\\\sum_{\\\\{j: i\\\\in G_j\\\\}} 2^{-(j+1)}\\\\), which for v_2(i)=t evaluates to \\\\(\\\\le 2^{-d+t+1}\\\\). The novel ingredient is to bound \\\\(\\\\sum_{i\\\\in S} 2^{v_2(i)}\\\\) for L-grid-aligned steps: each changed index i lies within distance <2L of a multiple of L; one can show (standard 2-adic counting) that \\\\(\\\\sum_{i\\\\in S}2^{v_2(i)}\\\\) is \\\\(O\\\\big(m\\\\,2^{\\\\ell}\\\\,(1+\\\\log(\\\\tfrac{n}{L}))\\\\big)\\\\). Dividing by \\\\(2^d=n\\\\) yields the RHS. (I will write the detailed combinatorial bound in the next round; it uses that among N integers, the sum of the top-k values of v_2 is O(k log(N/k)+k), and here N≈n/L and k≈m≤N.)\\n\\n- Consequences (interpreting the two inequalities).\\n  • From Inequality 1: it constrains the total weighted progress at levels with \\\\(L_j\\\\ge L\\\\). In particular, it rules out (in an aligned step) making relative progress \\\\(\\\\Omega(1)\\\\) across more than O(1) geometrically spaced large scales—more precisely, if \\\\(\\\\text{Decrease}_j\\\\ge \\\\theta B_j\\\\) for all j in some set J with \\\\(L_j\\\\ge L\\\\), then \\\\(\\\\sum_{j\\\\in J} L/L_j\\\\) is bounded, which forces J to be concentrated on O(1) adjacent scales. (Note: this does not bound |J| by a constant—it bounds a weighted count; see caveats below.)\\n  • From Inequality 2: at small scales \\\\(L_j<L\\\\), the sum of relative decreases \\\\(\\\\sum \\\\text{Decrease}_j/B_j\\\\) is \\\\(O(\\\\log(n/L)/L)\\\\). Thus for large L (coarse steps), only a tiny number of small-scale levels can see a constant-fraction drop; quantitatively, the number of j with \\\\(\\\\text{Decrease}_j\\\\ge \\\\theta B_j\\\\) and \\\\(L_j<L\\\\) is \\\\(O\\\\big((\\\\log(n/L))/(\\\\theta L)\\\\big)\\\\).\\n\\nWhy useful here. These inequalities, while not yet sufficient to give an \\\\(O(1)\\\\) drop of \\\\(\\\\sum_j |\\\\log B_j - (d-j)|\\\\) per step, provide scale-sensitive trade-offs that any “phase-by-scale” lower bound will need. They also identify the small-scale vs. large-scale dichotomy within an aligned step.\\n\\n### Important reassessment: the “O(1) active levels per step” claim is likely false\\n- The earlier speculative Lemma 2 (“a matched boundary is only useful for O(1) levels, hence only O(1) levels can change by a constant factor per step”) appears untenable. Heuristic counterexample: take L=1, align inner boundaries on the 1-grid, and partition into singletons matched pairwise across the entire array. Then S contains almost all indices (up to endpoints), so \\\\(|S\\\\cap G_j|\\\\) is \\\\(\\\\Theta(n/L_j)=\\\\Theta(B_j)\\\\) for all j simultaneously. Toggle-locality then permits \\\\(\\\\Theta(1)\\\\) relative decreases for \\\\(\\\\Theta(\\\\log n)\\\\) many levels in the same step. This directly contradicts the “O(1) active levels” narrative.\\n- What is still tenable. Our new inequalities show that even though many levels can progress at once, an aligned step cannot simultaneously give large relative progress at scales far below L (Inequality 2) and its weighted progress across higher scales is bounded (Inequality 1). This suggests that any robust lower bound must measure progress with a scale-sensitive potential rather than a flat sum of \\\\(|\\\\log B_j - (d-j)|\\\\).\\n\\n### A restricted-class milestone: towards an \\\\(\\\\Omega(\\\\log^2 n)\\\\) bound for scale-phased algorithms\\n- Restricted model hypothesis. Consider algorithms that operate in phases; in each phase t, all matched pairs have sizes within a factor-2 window [L_t,2L_t), and (possibly after discarding a constant fraction of pairs by residue-class averaging) the inner boundaries are aligned to the L_t-grid.\\n- Strategy sketch. Define a scale-sensitive potential \\\\(\\\\Psi(A)=\\\\sum_j w_t(j)\\\\,|\\\\log_2 B_j(A) - (d-j)|\\\\) whose weights \\\\(w_t(j)\\\\) sharply peak around the “home scale” \\\\(L_j\\\\approx L_t\\\\), e.g., \\\\(w_t(j)=\\\\alpha^{|\\\\log_2 L_j - \\\\log_2 L_t|}\\\\) for a fixed \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\in(0,1)\\\\). Using Inequalities 1–2 plus the pair-budget bound, aim to prove that in any L_t-aligned phase, \\\\(\\\\Psi\\\\) decreases by at most a constant. Since \\\\(\\\\sum_t 1=\\\\Theta(\\\\log n)\\\\) phases are needed to cover all scales L_t=2^t, this would force \\\\(\\\\Omega(\\\\log^2 n)\\\\) steps. This is a realistic, checkable plan for the restricted model.\\n- Status. The per-phase constant-drop claim requires a careful combinatorial bound on the weighted sum of decreases induced by the S-edges; our Inequality 1 gives the “upper tail” (\\\\(L_j\\\\ge L_t\\\\)) control, and Inequality 2 controls the “lower tail” (\\\\(L_j<L_t\\\\)). I will formalize the choice of \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and complete the per-phase bound next.\\n\\n### Gaps and clarifications in output.md\\n- Suggest adding the new “pair-budget” lemma stated above; it is an immediate corollary of Lemma 3 (toggle-locality) and is useful for quick necessary conditions.\\n- The equal-scale, grid-aligned cross-level bounds (Inequalities 1–2) are new and not yet in output.md. They are specialized to A_0, but they capture the key arithmetic-progression intersection needed for any scale-phased lower bound. I recommend curating Inequality 1 (fully rigorous as written) and flagging Inequality 2 as a lemma with a short proof deferred (the only remaining detail is the bound \\\\(\\\\sum_{i\\\\in S}2^{v_2(i)}=O\\\\big(m2^\\\\ell(1+\\\\log(n/L))\\\\big)\\\\), which I’ll write out).\\n- Caution: the earlier envisioned “O(1) active levels per step” is incompatible with aligned steps at small scale (L=1); hence it should not be pursued as a general lemma. The per-level factor-3 cap remains correct and relevant but does not by itself deliver \\\\(\\\\Omega(\\\\log^2 n)\\\\).\\n\\n### Obstacles\\n- The sum-of-logs potential \\\\(\\\\Phi(A)=\\\\sum_j |\\\\log_2 B_j(A)-(d-j)|\\\\) can drop by \\\\(\\\\Theta(\\\\log n)\\\\) in a single step (e.g., L=1 aligned), so it is not suitable to yield \\\\(\\\\Omega(\\\\log^2 n)\\\\) via an \\\\(O(1)\\\\) per-step drop.\\n- Cross-level scarcity in full generality (without alignment/restrictions) appears false at the granularity of “number of active levels.” New lower-bound proofs must use scale-sensitive weights and exploit alignment or pair-size budgets.\\n\\n### Next steps (concrete and testable)\\n1) Curate the “pair-budget” lemma into output.md.\\n2) Curate Inequality 1 (large-scale weighted bound) for L-aligned steps from A_0, with a clean proof (as above).\\n3) Provide a complete proof of Inequality 2: write the combinatorial bound \\\\(\\\\sum_{i\\\\in S}2^{v_2(i)}=O\\\\big(m2^\\\\ell(1+\\\\log(n/L))\\\\big)\\\\) and record it as a lemma on 2-adic valuation sums near an L-grid.\\n4) Formalize a per-phase potential \\\\(\\\\Psi_t\\\\) with geometric weights around scale L_t and prove an \\\\(O(1)\\\\) per-phase drop in the restricted (aligned, equal-scale) model, yielding \\\\(\\\\Omega(\\\\log^2 n)\\\\) steps for that class of algorithms.\\n5) Empirics on small n (n=32,64): verify that an L=1 aligned step from A_0 can reduce \\\\(B_j\\\\) by a constant factor for \\\\(\\\\Theta(\\\\log n)\\\\) levels, corroborating the reassessment.\\n6) Begin investigating whether a strong “central-boundary demand” lemma can be salvaged: quantify, per level j, the maximal number of decreases realizable by outer boundaries alone; aim to show that to achieve \\\\(\\\\Omega(B_j)\\\\) decreases one must contribute \\\\(\\\\Omega(B_j)\\\\) via inner boundaries when \\\\(L_j\\\\lesssim L\\\\). This would strengthen Inequality 2 and aid the per-phase bound.\\n\\n### Why this counts as progress\\n- Adds a universal, clean “pair-budget” demand bound for \\\\(\\\\text{Decrease}_j\\\\) that will be used in multiple places.\\n- Proves a sharp cross-level inequality (Inequality 1) for aligned steps and outlines a second (Inequality 2) with a near-complete proof plan.\\n- Correctly identifies and documents the failure of the “O(1) active levels” approach, steering the program towards scale-sensitive potentials, which are more realistic for an \\\\(\\\\Omega(\\\\log^2 n)\\\\) lower bound in restricted models.\\n- Sets up a feasible restricted-model milestone (equal-scale, grid-aligned phases) where an \\\\(\\\\Omega(\\\\log^2 n)\\\\) lower bound appears within reach.\\n\"}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"auto","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"ProverOutput","schema_":{"properties":{"progress_md":{"description":"Append-only progress notes","title":"Progress Md","type":"string"}},"required":["progress_md"],"title":"ProverOutput","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":47996,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":30599,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":27136},"total_tokens":78595},"user":null,"store":true}
