  "summary_md": "This round develops two usable cross-level inequalities for L-grid-aligned steps from A_0 and a universal \u201cpair-budget\u201d lemma, and it overturns the earlier \u201cO(1) active levels per step\u201d hope. The pair-budget lemma gives Decrease_j \u2264 |T_j(A)\u2229S| \u2264 |S| \u2264 3m and forces m \u2265 (\u03b8/3)\u00b7B_j(A) to realize a \u03b8-fraction drop at level j. For A_0 and steps with pairs of size in [L,2L) whose inner boundaries lie on the L-grid the authors prove: (1) a large-scale weighted bound \u03a3_{L_j\u2265L} (L/L_j)\u00b7Decrease_j \u2264 2|S| \u2264 6m \u2264 6n/L, and (2) a small-scale fractional bound \u03a3_{L_j<L} Decrease_j/B_j(A_0) = O((log(n/L))/L) (the latter reduces to bounding \u03a3_{i\u2208S} 2^{v2(i)} = O(m\u00b72^\u2113(1+log(n/L))). A concrete counterexample shows an L=1 aligned step can give constant-factor drops at \u0398(log n) levels, so a flat \u201cO(1) active levels\u201d lemma is false. A realistic route is a restricted phase-by-scale model (equal-scale, grid-aligned phases) with a geometric-weighted potential \u03a8_t; proving an O(1) per-phase drop there would imply \u03a9(log^2 n).
