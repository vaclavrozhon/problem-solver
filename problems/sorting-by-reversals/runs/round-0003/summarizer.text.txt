  "summary_md": "This round develops two usable cross-level inequalities for L-grid-aligned steps from A_0 and a universal “pair-budget” lemma, and it overturns the earlier “O(1) active levels per step” hope. The pair-budget lemma gives Decrease_j ≤ |T_j(A)∩S| ≤ |S| ≤ 3m and forces m ≥ (θ/3)·B_j(A) to realize a θ-fraction drop at level j. For A_0 and steps with pairs of size in [L,2L) whose inner boundaries lie on the L-grid the authors prove: (1) a large-scale weighted bound Σ_{L_j≥L} (L/L_j)·Decrease_j ≤ 2|S| ≤ 6m ≤ 6n/L, and (2) a small-scale fractional bound Σ_{L_j<L} Decrease_j/B_j(A_0) = O((log(n/L))/L) (the latter reduces to bounding Σ_{i∈S} 2^{v2(i)} = O(m·2^ℓ(1+log(n/L))). A concrete counterexample shows an L=1 aligned step can give constant-factor drops at Θ(log n) levels, so a flat “O(1) active levels” lemma is false. A realistic route is a restricted phase-by-scale model (equal-scale, grid-aligned phases) with a geometric-weighted potential Ψ_t; proving an O(1) per-phase drop there would imply Ω(log^2 n).
