High-level summary: There is solid, rigorously usable progress on two fronts: (i) an exact Hamming-sum identity that links Σ_j(B_j−1) to the sum of Hamming distances across adjacencies, and (ii) a clean scale-weighted cross-level inequality for steps from A_0 that upper-bounds weighted decreases at coarse levels. However, one of the proposed “alignment-vanishing” claims is false as stated, and the “sub-run sharpening” needs to be corrected to a one-sided (decrease-only) claim. The more ambitious small-scale inequality (Inequality 2) is promising but currently not rigorous; it requires a careful 2-adic summation bound that is not yet provided.

Detailed audit and guidance by prover:

Prover 01
- Hamming-sum identity across levels: Correct and very useful. For any A, Σ_j(B_j(A)−1)=Σ_i HD_A(i). Across a step A→A′, Σ_j(B_j(A′)−B_j(A))=Σ_{i∈S}(HD_{A′}(i)−HD_A(i)). This is an exact accounting and pairs well with toggle-locality. I curated this into output.md.
- Sub-run “per-pair sharpening” (s<L_j): The stated conclusion Δ_pair(j)∈{−1,0,1} is false. Counterexample (n a power of 2, A=A_0): let L be the last element of a j-run and R the first element of the next j-run so that s=|L∪R|=2<L_j. Before the swap, among the three interfaces only the inner one is a j-boundary (X=1); after swapping, all three are boundaries (Y=3). Thus Δ_pair(j)=X−Y=−2, i.e., B_j increases by 2. The correct salvage is one-sided: among the three changed indices at most one lies in G_j, hence the per-pair j-decrease is ≤1 (but increases up to +2 are possible). I curated this corrected, one-sided lemma (first-step at A_0).
- “Decrease-only alignment bound at A_0 under strong L-grid alignment”: As written, this is false. The claim “if 2^{d−1−j}∤L then Decrease_j=0” fails since S⊆{multiples of L} can still contain indices that are also multiples of L_j (e.g., multiples of lcm(L,L_j)); toggle-locality cannot force the intersection to be empty. The example for n=8,L=2 actually contradicts the claim. I did not curate this and flag it as incorrect.

Prover 02
- Pair-budget lemma: Correct and useful as a universal necessary condition. Decrease_j≤|T_j(A)∩S|≤|S|≤3m. In particular, a θ-fraction drop of B_j forces m≥(θ/3)B_j(A). Curated as a corollary.
- Large-scale weighted inequality (Inequality 1): Correct, clean, and immediately useful. For A=A_0 and any L=2^ℓ, Σ_{j:L_j≥L}(L/L_j)·Decrease_j ≤ 2|S| ≤ 6m ≤ 6n/L. I curated this (in a slightly more general form that separates the 2|S| bound from the additional assumptions m≤n/L).
- Small-scale inequality (Inequality 2): Not yet rigorous. The key bound Σ_{i∈S}2^{v_2(i)}=O(m·2^ℓ·(1+log(n/L))) is not established, and the step “each i is within distance <2L of an L-grid point” does not imply any control on v_2(i). Two viable routes: (a) a general extremal bound for any K-subset S⊆{1,…,n−1} that Σ_{i∈S}2^{v_2(i)} ≤ C K log(2n/K), yielding Σ_j Decrease_j/B_j ≤ O((log L)/L) when K≤3m≤3n/L (this needs a clean proof by counting numbers with high 2-adic valuation), or (b) restrict to S_inner on the L-grid and separately prove a “central-boundary demand” lemma showing decreases at small scales are dominated by inner-boundary hits, which allows dropping outer-boundary contributions on the RHS. Until one of these is written, I kept Inequality 2 out of output.md and summarized the plan in notes.

Reassessment: The “O(1) active levels per step” goal is not credible in general. A fully L=1-aligned step can have |S∩G_j|≈B_j(A_0) for Θ(log n) many j simultaneously. While this does not by itself prove Θ(1) relative decreases across all those levels in one step, it convincingly shows that any lower bound must be scale-sensitive and exploit weighted trade-offs (as in Inequality 1) rather than counting active levels.

Next-step suggestions
- Finish a rigorous bound on Σ_{i∈S}2^{v_2(i)}. Either (i) prove the general extremal inequality Σ_{i∈S}2^{v_2(i)} ≤ C K log(2n/K) for any |S|=K, or (ii) prove a central-boundary demand lemma so that only S_inner (an L-grid subset) matters for decreases, allowing the sharper O(n log(n/L)) bound via Σ_{k≤n/L}2^{v_2(k)}.
- Complete a per-pair case analysis on the six endpoint bits (a_L,L_1,L_k,R_1,R_m,a_R) to quantify when a large per-pair decrease requires the inner boundary to “align” at level j. This will support the central-boundary demand.
- Use the curated Hamming-sum identity to design signed cross-level weights so that per-index contributions cancel across levels. Aim to show Σ_j w_j·Δ_j(i) is O(1) for each changed index i.
- Pursue a restricted model milestone: per-phase (equal-scale, grid-aligned) potential with geometric weights around the home scale; combine Inequality 1 with a proved version of small-scale control to get an O(1) drop per phase and hence Ω(log^2 n) steps across scales.
- Small-n experiments (n∈{16,32,64}) to validate the scale-weighted trade-offs and to probe the prevalence of multi-level simultaneous decreases in aligned steps.
