High-level summary: There is solid, rigorously usable progress on two fronts: (i) an exact Hamming-sum identity that links Σ_j(B_j−1) to the sum of Hamming distances across adjacencies, and (ii) a clean scale-weighted cross-level inequality for steps from A_0 that upper-bounds weighted decreases at coarse levels. However, one of the proposed “alignment-vanishing” claims is false as stated, and the “sub-run sharpening” needs to be corrected to a one-sided (decrease-only) claim. The more ambitious small-scale inequality (Inequality 2) is promising but currently not rigorous; it requires a careful 2-adic summation bound that is not yet provided.
