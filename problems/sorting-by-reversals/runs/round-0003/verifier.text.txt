{"feedback_md":"High-level summary: There is solid, rigorously usable progress on two fronts: (i) an exact Hamming-sum identity that links Σ_j(B_j−1) to the sum of Hamming distances across adjacencies, and (ii) a clean scale-weighted cross-level inequality for steps from A_0 that upper-bounds weighted decreases at coarse levels. However, one of the proposed “alignment-vanishing” claims is false as stated, and the “sub-run sharpening” needs to be corrected to a one-sided (decrease-only) claim. The more ambitious small-scale inequality (Inequality 2) is promising but currently not rigorous; it requires a careful 2-adic summation bound that is not yet provided.\n\nDetailed audit and guidance by prover:\n\nProver 01\n- Hamming-sum identity across levels: Correct and very useful. For any A, Σ_j(B_j(A)−1)=Σ_i HD_A(i). Across a step A→A′, Σ_j(B_j(A′)−B_j(A))=Σ_{i∈S}(HD_{A′}(i)−HD_A(i)). This is an exact accounting and pairs well with toggle-locality. I curated this into output.md.\n- Sub-run “per-pair sharpening” (s<L_j): The stated conclusion Δ_pair(j)∈{−1,0,1} is false. Counterexample (n a power of 2, A=A_0): let L be the last element of a j-run and R the first element of the next j-run so that s=|L∪R|=2<L_j. Before the swap, among the three interfaces only the inner one is a j-boundary (X=1); after swapping, all three are boundaries (Y=3). Thus Δ_pair(j)=X−Y=−2, i.e., B_j increases by 2. The correct salvage is one-sided: among the three changed indices at most one lies in G_j, hence the per-pair j-decrease is ≤1 (but increases up to +2 are possible). I curated this corrected, one-sided lemma (first-step at A_0).\n- “Decrease-only alignment bound at A_0 under strong L-grid alignment”: As written, this is false. The claim “if 2^{d−1−j}∤L then Decrease_j=0” fails since S⊆{multiples of L} can still contain indices that are also multiples of L_j (e.g., multiples of lcm(L,L_j)); toggle-locality cannot force the intersection to be empty. The example for n=8,L=2 actually contradicts the claim. I did not curate this and flag it as incorrect.\n\nProver 02\n- Pair-budget lemma: Correct and useful as a universal necessary condition. Decrease_j≤|T_j(A)∩S|≤|S|≤3m. In particular, a θ-fraction drop of B_j forces m≥(θ/3)B_j(A). Curated as a corollary.\n- Large-scale weighted inequality (Inequality 1): Correct, clean, and immediately useful. For A=A_0 and any L=2^ℓ, Σ_{j:L_j≥L}(L/L_j)·Decrease_j ≤ 2|S| ≤ 6m ≤ 6n/L. I curated this (in a slightly more general form that separates the 2|S| bound from the additional assumptions m≤n/L).\n- Small-scale inequality (Inequality 2): Not yet rigorous. The key bound Σ_{i∈S}2^{v_2(i)}=O(m·2^ℓ·(1+log(n/L))) is not established, and the step “each i is within distance <2L of an L-grid point” does not imply any control on v_2(i). Two viable routes: (a) a general extremal bound for any K-subset S⊆{1,…,n−1} that Σ_{i∈S}2^{v_2(i)} ≤ C K log(2n/K), yielding Σ_j Decrease_j/B_j ≤ O((log L)/L) when K≤3m≤3n/L (this needs a clean proof by counting numbers with high 2-adic valuation), or (b) restrict to S_inner on the L-grid and separately prove a “central-boundary demand” lemma showing decreases at small scales are dominated by inner-boundary hits, which allows dropping outer-boundary contributions on the RHS. Until one of these is written, I kept Inequality 2 out of output.md and summarized the plan in notes.\n\nReassessment: The “O(1) active levels per step” goal is not credible in general. A fully L=1-aligned step can have |S∩G_j|≈B_j(A_0) for Θ(log n) many j simultaneously. While this does not by itself prove Θ(1) relative decreases across all those levels in one step, it convincingly shows that any lower bound must be scale-sensitive and exploit weighted trade-offs (as in Inequality 1) rather than counting active levels.\n\nNext-step suggestions\n- Finish a rigorous bound on Σ_{i∈S}2^{v_2(i)}. Either (i) prove the general extremal inequality Σ_{i∈S}2^{v_2(i)} ≤ C K log(2n/K) for any |S|=K, or (ii) prove a central-boundary demand lemma so that only S_inner (an L-grid subset) matters for decreases, allowing the sharper O(n log(n/L)) bound via Σ_{k≤n/L}2^{v_2(k)}.\n- Complete a per-pair case analysis on the six endpoint bits (a_L,L_1,L_k,R_1,R_m,a_R) to quantify when a large per-pair decrease requires the inner boundary to “align” at level j. This will support the central-boundary demand.\n- Use the curated Hamming-sum identity to design signed cross-level weights so that per-index contributions cancel across levels. Aim to show Σ_j w_j·Δ_j(i) is O(1) for each changed index i.\n- Pursue a restricted model milestone: per-phase (equal-scale, grid-aligned) potential with geometric weights around the home scale; combine Inequality 1 with a proved version of small-scale control to get an O(1) drop per phase and hence Ω(log^2 n) steps across scales.\n- Small-n experiments (n∈{16,32,64}) to validate the scale-weighted trade-offs and to probe the prevalence of multi-level simultaneous decreases in aligned steps.\n","new_notes_md":"New exact identities, corrections, and scale-weighted constraints\n\n1) Exact Hamming-sum identity across levels\n- For any array A, define HD_A(i) as the Hamming distance (in d bits) between the values at positions i and i+1. Then for all A,\n  Σ_{j=0}^{d−1} (B_j(A) − 1) = Σ_{i=1}^{n−1} HD_A(i).\n- Across one step A→A′ with changed-adjacency set S (three per pair),\n  Σ_{j=0}^{d−1} (B_j(A′) − B_j(A)) = Σ_{i∈S} (HD_{A′}(i) − HD_A(i)).\nExplanation: For each i, the indicator that i∈T_j(A) is exactly the indicator that the j-th bits at i and i+1 differ; summing over j gives HD_A(i). Subtracting two arrays and noting HD is unchanged outside S yields the step identity. This is complementary to toggle-locality and shows per changed index the total boundary mass across all levels changes by at most d.\n\n2) Sub-run regime from A_0: corrected one-sided statement\n- Setup: A=A_0, fix j and its run length L_j=2^{d−1−j}. Consider a single pair (L,R) with union U of length s=|U|.\n- Fact (geometry on G_j): If s<L_j then among the three changed indices of this pair (left outer, inner, right outer), at most one index belongs to G_j=T_j(A_0). Indeed, the three indices lie in an index interval of length s, which contains at most one multiple of L_j.\n- Consequence (decrease-only). For such a pair and level j, the per-pair j-decrease is ≤1 (toggle-locality gives Decrease_j ≤ |T_j(A_0)∩S_pair| ≤ 1). Caution: increases can be as large as +2 in this regime (e.g., when the pair straddles a single j-boundary), so |Δ_pair(j)| is not ≤1 in general.\n- Counterexample to the |Δ_pair(j)|≤1 claim: Let L be the last item of a j-run and R the first item of the next j-run in A_0; then s=2<L_j. Before the swap, only the inner interface is a j-boundary; after swapping, all three interfaces are j-boundaries, so the per-pair change is Δ_pair(j)=−2 (B_j increases by 2).\n\n3) “Decrease-only alignment bound” as stated is false\n- The claim “if all pair boundaries lie on the L-grid then for j with L_j∤L one has Decrease_j=0” does not hold. Even if S⊆{multiples of L}, S can still contain indices that are also multiples of L_j (e.g., multiples of lcm(L,L_j)), so |G_j∩S| may be nonempty. Toggle-locality alone cannot force Decrease_j=0 under this assumption. Any valid one-sided alignment bound must add further structure about which L-residue classes are used by S.\n\n4) A clean large-scale weighted inequality from A_0\n- For A=A_0 and any power-of-two L=2^ℓ,\n  Σ_{j: L_j≥L} (L/L_j)·Decrease_j ≤ 2|S|.\n  In steps with m pairs, this gives Σ_{j: L_j≥L} (L/L_j)·Decrease_j ≤ 6m. If in addition all pair lengths lie in [L,2L), then m≤n/L, yielding Σ_{j: L_j≥L} (L/L_j)·Decrease_j ≤ 6n/L.\n- Proof idea: Combine toggle-locality with the dyadic alignment of G_j in A_0; for i with v_2(i)=t, the inner sum Σ_{j: i∈G_j, L_j≥L} (L/L_j)=Σ_{s=ℓ}^{t}2^{ℓ−s}≤2.\n\n5) On small-scale control (sketch; not yet curated)\n- Using weights w_j:=1/B_j(A_0)=L_j/n, toggle-locality and dyadic alignment give\n  Σ_j w_j·Decrease_j ≤ (2/n)·Σ_{i∈S} 2^{v_2(i)}.\n- Two routes to control the RHS:\n  (a) General extremal bound: For any K-subset S⊆{1,…,n−1}, prove Σ_{i∈S}2^{v_2(i)} ≤ C K log(2n/K). With K≤|S|≤3m≤3n/L this yields Σ_{j: L_j<L} Decrease_j/B_j(A_0) ≤ O((log L)/L).\n  (b) L-grid inner-boundary route: If a “central-boundary demand” lemma shows small-scale decreases must be paid mostly by inner boundaries, then restricting to S_inner⊆{multiples of L} gives Σ_{i∈S_inner}2^{v_2(i)} ≤ 2^ℓ·Σ_{k≤n/L}2^{v_2(k)} = O(n·log(n/L)), hence Σ_j Decrease_j/B_j(A_0) ≤ O(log(n/L)/L).\n- Either route needs a complete proof before inclusion in output.\n\n6) Reassessment of the “O(1) active levels per step)” heuristic\n- In aligned steps at very small scale (e.g., L=1), S can intersect G_j at Θ(B_j(A_0)) for Θ(log n) many j simultaneously, so any argument purely bounding the number of active levels is untenable. Scale-sensitive weighted bounds (as above) are the right replacements.\n\n7) Restricted-phase milestone\n- For algorithms operating in phases with pair sizes in [L_t,2L_t) and inner L_t-grid alignment, define a phase-weighted potential Ψ_t(A) concentrated near the home scale L_t. Combine the large-scale inequality in (4) with a proved small-scale control to show O(1) drop per phase, yielding Ω(log^2 n) steps across scales.\n\nActionable next steps\n- Prove a sharp bound on Σ_{i∈S}2^{v_2(i)} via route (a) or (b) above.\n- Complete a per-pair six-bit case analysis; extract a “central-boundary demand” lemma quantifying the necessary contribution of the inner boundary for large decreases at a fixed j.\n- Design signed cross-level weights using the Hamming-sum identity to bound per-index signed contributions by O(1).

For i∈{1,…,n−1}, let HD_A(i) be the Hamming distance in d-bit binary between the values at positions i and i+1.

For fixed i, the indicator that i∈T_j(A) is exactly the indicator that the j-th bits of the adjacent values differ; summing over j gives HD_A(i). Summing over i yields the first identity. Subtracting the identity for A from that for A′ gives Σ_j(B_j(A′)−B_j(A)) = Σ_i(HD_{A′}(i)−HD_A(i)). Since HD is unchanged outside S, the sum over all i reduces to the sum over i∈S. ∎\n\nCorollary 7.1 (Pair-budget demand for decreases).\nLet a step use m disjoint pairs and S be its set of changed indices.

The first inequality is Lemma 3; |S|≤3m since each pair contributes at most three changed indices. The demand bound is immediate. ∎\n\nLemma 7.2 (A_0 sub-run per-pair decrease bound).\nLet A=A_0. Fix j and its run length L_j=2^{d−1−j}. Consider a single swapped pair (L,R) whose union U has length s< L_j, and let S_pair be the three changed indices contributed by this pair. Then |T_j(A_0)∩S_pair|≤1; consequently the per-pair decrease at level j in this step satisfies Decrease_j ≤ 1.\nProof. The three changed indices lie between the left-outer and right-outer interfaces; this integer interval has length s< L_j and hence contains at most one multiple of L_j. Since G_j=T_j(A_0) is exactly the set of multiples of L_j, at most one of the three changed indices lies in G_j. Toggle-locality gives Decrease_j ≤ |T_j(A_0)∩S_pair| ≤ 1. ∎\n\nTheorem 8 (Large-scale weighted decrease bound from A_0).\nLet A=A_0 and L=2^ℓ.

If, moreover, all pair lengths lie in [L,2L), then m≤n/L and hence Σ_{j: L_j≥L} (L/L_j)·Decrease_j ≤ 6n/L.\nProof. By Lemma 3 and Theorem 6 (weighted form), for any nonnegative weights a_j,\n  Σ_j a_j·Decrease_j ≤ Σ_{i∈S} Σ_{j: i∈G_j} a_j.\nTake a_j = (L/L_j)·1_{L_j≥L}. For i with 2-adic valuation v_2(i)=t, the inner sum equals Σ_{s=ℓ}^{t} 2^{ℓ−s} ≤ 2 (empty if t<ℓ). Summing over i∈S gives Σ_{j: L_j≥L} (L/L_j)·Decrease_j ≤ 2|S|.
