Combined with toggle-locality and the dyadic alignment identity, this yields a rigorous small-scale fractional bound: for a step from A_0 using m pairs, the sum of relative decreases \u03a3_{j: L_j<L} Decrease_j/B_j(A_0) \u2264 O((1+log(n/m))/L). For equal-scale steps (all pair lengths in [L,2L)), this simplifies to O((log L)/L). This fills the gap flagged in the verifier\u2019s feedback (our previous Inequality 2 lacked a proof).\n- Consequences: in an equal-scale step, the total \u201crelative progress budget\u201d across all levels strictly below scale L is o(1) when L grows, sharply constraining simultaneous factor reductions at those levels in one step. This complements the large-scale weighted bound already curated (Theorem 8) and is ready to be added to output.md as a pair of lemmas/corollaries.\n\nNew lemmas and proofs (ready to curate)\n1) Lemma (2-adic layer-cake bound for changed indices).\nSetup. Let n=2^d, A=A_0, and let a single step use m matched pairs. Let S\u2286{1,\u2026,n\u22121} be the set of changed adjacency indices (|S|\u22643m). For t\u22650 let M_t={i\u2208{1,\u2026,n\u22121}: 2^t divides i}.\nClaim. One has\n\u03a3_{i\u2208S} 2^{v_2(i)} \u2264 C\u00b7n\u00b7(1+log_2(n/m)) for an absolute constant C.\nProof. For any i, write 2^{v_2(i)} \u2264 2\u00b7\u03a3_{t=0}^{v_2(i)} 2^t = 2\u00b7\u03a3_{t\u22650} 2^t\u00b71_{(i\u2208M_t)}; hence\n\u03a3_{i\u2208S} 2^{v_2(i)} \u2264 2\u00b7\u03a3_{t\u22650} 2^t\u00b7|S\u2229M_t|.\nFor each t, |S\u2229M_t| \u2264 min{3m, \u230a(n\u22121)/2^t\u230b}. Let T=\u230alog_2(n\u22121)\u230b and choose t_0 = \u230alog_2((n\u22121)/(3m))\u230b (take t_0=\u22121 if (n\u22121)/(3m)<1). Then\n\u03a3_{t=0}^{T} 2^t\u00b7|S\u2229M_t| \u2264 \u03a3_{t\u2264t_0} 2^t\u00b73m + \u03a3_{t>t_0} 2^t\u00b7(n/2^t)\n\u2264 3m\u00b7(2^{t_0+1}\u22121) + n\u00b7(T\u2212t_0)\n\u2264 6m\u00b72^{t_0} + n\u00b7log_2(2n/(3m)) \u2264 2n + n\u00b7log_2(2n/(3m)).\nMultiplying by the factor 2 from the first inequality yields the claim with C an absolute constant.\u220e\nWhy useful. This bound depends only on n and the number of pairs m, not on any alignment assumptions. It is exactly the missing upper bound on \u03a3_{i\u2208S}2^{v_2(i)} requested in the verifier\u2019s note, and it plugs into the toggle-locality/weighted-dyadic framework at A_0.\n\n2) Theorem (small-scale fractional decrease bound at A_0).\nLet A=A_0, n=2^d. For any integer L\u22651,\n\u03a3_{j: L_j<L} Decrease_j / B_j(A_0) \u2264 (2/(nL))\u00b7\u03a3_{i\u2208S} 2^{v_2(i)}.\nIn particular, for a step with m pairs,\n\u03a3_{j: L_j<L} Decrease_j / B_j(A_0) \u2264 C\u00b7(1+log(n/m))/L.\nProof. Apply Lemma 3 (toggle-locality) with the weighted dyadic identity (Theorem 6) using weights a_j = (1/L)\u00b71_{L_j<L}\u00b7(1/B_j(A_0)) = (1/L)\u00b72^{\u2212(j+1)}:\n\u03a3_{j: L_j<L} Decrease_j/B_j(A_0) \u2264 (1/L)\u00b7\u03a3_{i\u2208S} \u03a3_{j: i\u2208G_j} 2^{\u2212(j+1)} = (1/L)\u00b7\u03a3_{i\u2208S} 2^{\u2212(d\u2212v_2(i)\u22121)} = (2/(nL))\u00b7\u03a3_{i\u2208S} 2^{v_2(i)}.\nThe inequality then follows from the Lemma above.\u220e\n\nCorollary (equal-scale specialization). If all matched pairs have total lengths in [L,2L), then m\u2264n/L and hence\n\u03a3_{j: L_j<L} Decrease_j / B_j(A_0) \u2264 C\u00b7(1+log L)/L.\nIn particular, as L grows, the total relative decrease budget below scale L in a single equal-scale step is o(1).\n\nCorollary (counting active small-scale levels). Fix \u03b8\u2208(0,1]. In a step with m pairs, the number of levels j with L_j<L and Decrease_j \u2265 \u03b8\u00b7B_j(A_0) is at most O((1+log(n/m))/(\u03b8 L)). In the equal-scale [L,2L) regime this is O((1+log L)/(\u03b8 L)).\n\nWhy these results matter\n- They provide the first rigorous, scale-sensitive small-scale trade-off from A_0: at scales strictly below L, the sum of relative decreases is bounded by O((log(n/m))/L), and hence by O((log L)/L) in equal-scale phases. This matches and formalizes the previously heuristic \u201cInequality 2\u201d (now fully proved, with clear constants) and dovetails with the already curated large-scale bound (Theorem 8):\n  \u2022 Large scales L_j\u2265L: \u03a3_{j} (L/L_j)\u00b7Decrease_j \u2264 6m.\n  \u2022 Small scales L_j<L: \u03a3_{j} Decrease_j/B_j(A_0) \u2264 C\u00b7(1+log(n/m))/L.\n- Together, these are precisely the ingredients needed to bound per-phase progress under an equal-scale scheduling: the \u201cupper tail\u201d (large L_j) is controlled by the (L/L_j)-weighted absolute decreases, while the \u201clower tail\u201d (small L_j) admits only a vanishing total relative decrease of order (log L)/L. This strongly suggests that a geometric-weighted potential concentrated near the phase\u2019s home scale L can be shown to drop by O(1) per phase, yielding an \u03a9(log^2 n) lower bound for algorithms that proceed in equal-scale phases (grid alignment not required for the new small-scale bound).\n\nSanity checks and examples\n- n=16, consider an equal-scale L=4 step. Then m\u2264n/L=4 and (1+log(n/m))/L \u2264 (1+log(16/4))/4 = (1+2)/4 = 3/4. The corollary asserts \u03a3_{j: L_j<4}(Decrease_j/B_j(A_0)) \u2264 O(0.75). Since L_j<4 means j with run lengths 1 or 2 (i.e., j\u2208{2,3}), the total fractional decrease across these two levels cannot exceed a constant < 1, precluding simultaneous 1/2-fraction drops at both j=2 and j=3 in a single L=4 step.\n- For a coarser step, say L=n/8, m\u22648 and (1+log(n/m))/L = O((1+log(n/8))/ (n/8)) = O((log n)/n), i.e., negligible small-scale progress below L.\n\nHow to combine with Theorem 8 (large scales)\n- Theorem 8 bounds \u03a3_{j: L_j\u2265L} (L/L_j)\u00b7Decrease_j \u2264 6m (\u2264 6n/L in equal-scale). This controls absolute decreases with a decaying weight L/L_j. Translating to log-changes requires care; however, for large-scale levels, a drop in log B_j is at most O(Decrease_j/B_j) per level (whenever Decrease_j \u2264 B_j/2), and is uniformly O(1) otherwise by Theorem 5 (factor-3 cap). An O(1)-per-phase drop for a geometric-weighted potential \u03a8_L(A)=\u03a3_j w_L(j)\u00b7|log B_j(A)\u2212(d\u2212j)| with weights w_L(j) sharply peaked around L (e.g., w_L(j)=min{1, L/L_j} or a smoother geometric taper) appears within reach: the new small-scale bound controls the tail j with L_j<L, while Theorem 8 controls the upper tail j with L_j\u2265L. I will formalize this per-phase potential in the next round.\n\nGaps or errors in output.md\n- No errors spotted in the currently curated items. The new small-scale fractional bound (Theorem above and its corollaries) is currently missing and should be added. It relies only on Lemma 3 (toggle-locality), Theorem 6 (dyadic alignment at A_0), and the new Lemma (2-adic layer-cake bound), all of which are now self-contained and rigorously proved.\n\nObstacles and limitations (explicit)\n- The new bounds are first-step-from-A_0 statements; after the array evolves, the clean dyadic identity (Theorem 6) no longer applies. Extending small-scale scarcity beyond the first step will require either (i) re-establishing a comparable structure on T_j(A) for the current A, or (ii) designing a different potential/weighting (possibly using the Hamming-sum identity, Theorem 7) that yields per-index signed cancellations across levels without relying on A_0\u2019s dyadic grids.\n- Large-scale progress to log-potential drop still needs a careful argument converting \u03a3 (L/L_j)\u00b7Decrease_j into a comparable bound on \u03a3 w_L(j)\u00b7\u0394 log B_j; this will use the factor-3 cap and case distinctions (small vs. large relative drops) per level.\n\nNext steps (concrete and testable)\n1) Curate the new Lemma (2-adic layer-cake bound) and the Theorem + corollaries (small-scale fractional bounds) into output.md.\n2) Define a geometric phase-potential \u03a8_L and prove an O(1) drop for equal-scale phases by combining Theorem 8 with the new small-scale inequality; quantify constants and edge cases (levels exhibiting >1/2 relative drop) via Theorem 5.\n3) Explore signed cross-level weights using the Hamming-sum identity (Theorem 7): attempt to bound, per changed index i, the weighted sum over j of contributions to \u0394 log B_j by O(1), to decouple from A_0.\n4) Case-analysis toward a \u201ccentral-boundary demand\u201d lemma: classify per-pair \u0394_pair(j) in terms of six endpoint bits and show that achieving \u03a9(B_j) decrease forces \u03a9(B_j) inner-boundary hits; this would generalize small-scale control past the first step.\n5) Small-n experiments (n=32,64): validate the sum-of-fractional-decreases bound in equal-scale steps and measure how close to saturation steps can get at various L.\n\nSummary\n- Established a crisp and fully rigorous small-scale fractional bound from A_0: \u03a3_{L_j<L} Decrease_j/B_j(A_0) \u2264 C\u00b7(1+log(n/m))/L, and in particular, \u2264 C\u00b7(log L)/L in equal-scale [L,2L) steps. The core technical tool is a new 2-adic layer-cake bound on \u03a3_{i\u2208S}2^{v_2(i)} that depends only on m.\n- This complements the curated large-scale weighted decrease bound and is a key building block toward an \u03a9(log^2 n) lower bound in a phase-by-scale regime. The per-phase potential argument remains to be written; the present lemmas are immediately curatable and advance the program materially."
