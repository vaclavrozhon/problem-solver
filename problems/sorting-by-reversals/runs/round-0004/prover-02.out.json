This sharpens and formalizes the 2-adic summation bound needed in Corollary 6.1 and yields \u03a3_j Decrease_j/B_j(A_0) \u2264 O(log(n/L)) in equal-scale steps with \u2264 n/L pairs.\n- Geometric-window weights (first-step from A_0): for any fixed scale L=2^\u2113 and any step (no alignment assumed) whose changed-index set is S, define a_j(L):=\u03b2^{| (d\u22121\u2212j) \u2212 \u2113 |}/2^{j+1} with \u03b2\u2208(0,1/2). Then \u03a3_j a_j(L)\u00b7Decrease_j \u2264 C_\u03b2\u00b7(L/n)\u00b7|S|. In particular, for equal-scale steps with m pairs (hence |S|\u22643m\u22643n/L), one gets \u03a3_j a_j(L)\u00b7Decrease_j \u2264 3C_\u03b2 = O(1). This gives an O(1) per-step cap on a scale-focused, cross-level weighted decrease from the bit-reversal start.\n\nGaps or corrections in output.md to flag\n- The current output already contains Theorem 8 (large-scale weighted decrease bound) and Lemma 7.2 (sub-run decrease bound), both correct. There is, however, still no curated bound of the form \u03a3_{i\u2208S}2^{v_2(i)} in terms of |S|. I recommend adding the extremal bound below as a lemma; it is used implicitly in several sketches and enables a clean derivation of \u03a3_j Decrease_j/B_j(A_0) \u2264 O(log(n/L)).\n- The program still lacks any signed, cross-level per-step bound that applies beyond the first step (once A deviates from A_0). The geometric-window lemma below is first-step specific (it uses T_j(A_0)=G_j) and cannot be applied verbatim after the array evolves.\n\nNew technical lemmas (ready to curate)\n1) Extremal 2-adic sum bound.\nLemma. Let N\u22651 and S\u2286{1,\u2026,N} with |S|=K\u22651. Then \u03a3_{i\u2208S} 2^{v_2(i)} \u2264 N\u00b7H_K, where H_K=1+1/2+\u22ef+1/K.\nProof. Order the weights w(i):=2^{v_2(i)} for i\u2208{1,\u2026,N} in nonincreasing order s_1\u2265s_2\u2265\u22ef\u2265s_N. For t\u22650, at most \u230aN/2^t\u230b integers have v_2\u2265t, i.e., at most \u230aN/2^t\u230b weights are \u22652^t. Hence for every \u2113\u22651, s_\u2113 \u2264 max{2^t : N/2^t \u2265 \u2113} \u2264 N/\u2113. Therefore \u03a3_{i\u2208S} 2^{v_2(i)} \u2264 \u03a3_{\u2113=1}^K s_\u2113 \u2264 \u03a3_{\u2113=1}^K (N/\u2113) = N\u00b7H_K.\u220e\nCorollary (small-scale fractional decreases, coarse but general). For A=A_0, any step with changed-index set S (|S|=K) satisfies\n\u03a3_{j=0}^{d\u22121} Decrease_j/B_j(A_0) = \u03a3_j 2^{\u2212(j+1)}\u00b7Decrease_j \u2264 (2/n)\u00b7\u03a3_{i\u2208S} 2^{v_2(i)} \u2264 2\u00b7H_K.\nIn particular, in an equal-scale step with m pairs (hence K\u22643m\u22643n/L), \u03a3_j Decrease_j/B_j(A_0) \u2264 O(log(n/L)).\nWhy useful: This fully rigorous bound replaces the previously sketched Inequality 2 with a clean, general estimate (though without the extra 1/L factor). It confirms that, in aggregate and relative to B_j(A_0), only logarithmic-in-(n/L) fractional shrinkage can be achieved across all levels in an equal-scale step.\n\n2) Geometric-window weighted cross-level decrease (first step from A_0).\nLemma (geometric window). Fix L=2^\u2113 and pick any \u03b2\u2208(0,1/2). Define scale-centered weights a_j(L):=\u03b2^{| (d\u22121\u2212j) \u2212 \u2113 |}/2^{j+1}. For A=A_0 and any one-step change with index set S,\n\u03a3_{j=0}^{d\u22121} a_j(L)\u00b7Decrease_j \u2264 C_\u03b2\u00b7(L/n)\u00b7|S|,\nwhere C_\u03b2 := (1/(1\u2212\u03b2/2) + 1/(1\u22122\u03b2)). In particular, for equal-scale steps with m pairs one has \u03a3_j a_j(L)\u00b7Decrease_j \u2264 3C_\u03b2=O(1).\nProof. By toggle-locality and Theorem 6 (weighted form at A_0),\n\u03a3_j a_j(L)\u00b7Decrease_j \u2264 \u03a3_{i\u2208S} \u03a3_{j: i\u2208G_j} a_j(L).\nFor i with v_2(i)=t, the inner sum ranges over j with s:=d\u22121\u2212j\u2208{0,1,\u2026,t} and equals\n\u03a3_{s=0}^{t} \u03b2^{|s\u2212\u2113|}\u00b72^{s\u2212d} = 2^{\u2212d}\u00b7(\u03a3_{s=0}^{\u2113} \u03b2^{\u2113\u2212s}2^{s} + \u03a3_{s=\u2113}^{t} \u03b2^{s\u2212\u2113}2^{s}).\nBound the two parts separately: \u03a3_{s=0}^{\u2113} \u03b2^{\u2113\u2212s}2^{s} = 2^{\u2113}\u00b7\u03a3_{r=0}^{\u2113} (\u03b2/2)^r \u2264 2^{\u2113}/(1\u2212\u03b2/2), and \u03a3_{s=\u2113}^{t} \u03b2^{s\u2212\u2113}2^{s} = 2^{\u2113}\u00b7\u03a3_{r=0}^{t\u2212\u2113} (2\u03b2)^r \u2264 2^{\u2113}/(1\u22122\u03b2). Thus, \u03a3_{j: i\u2208G_j} a_j(L) \u2264 C_\u03b2\u00b72^{\u2113\u2212d} = C_\u03b2\u00b7(L/n). Summing over i\u2208S gives the claim; using |S|\u22643m and m\u2264n/L (equal-scale) yields the O(1) consequence.\u220e\nRemarks.\n- Crucially, this does not assume any alignment; it is purely a first-step property from A_0. It precisely formalizes the \u201chome scale\u201d phenomenon: pairs with total size \u2248L can only induce O(1) total weighted decreases when measured by a geometric window centered at that scale.\n- The choice of \u03b2<1/2 ensures the tail beyond the home scale decays sufficiently quickly (the 2\u03b2 factor in the upper tail), giving a per-index constant bound.\n\nHow these help and their limits\n- The extremal 2-adic bound plus Corollary cleanly upper bound aggregate relative decreases across all levels by O(log(n/L)) in an equal-scale step. While not strong enough alone for an O(1) per-step drop of the unweighted potential, it quantifies a strict trade-off for small scales.\n- The geometric-window lemma provides an O(1) per-step cap for a family of scale-focused, cross-level weighted potentials at the bit-reversal start. This is the first rigorous cross-level scarcity result that is scale-sensitive and constant per equal-scale step.\n- Limitation: Both statements rely on A=A_0. After the first step, the boundary sets T_j(A) are no longer dyadic grids, so Theorem 6 cannot be applied directly. Extending the geometric-window argument beyond the first step requires new structure (e.g., showing that after a near-L step from A_0 the sets T_j(A) retain enough arithmetic regularity at scales \u2248L to re-run the argument, or developing a signed, per-index cancellation bound that is independent of A).\n\nSanity checks and examples\n- n=16, L=4 (\u2113=2), \u03b2=1/4. In a step of 4-block pairs (m\u22644), we have |S|\u226412 and L/n=1/4, hence \u03a3_j a_j(L)\u00b7Decrease_j \u2264 C_\u03b2\u00b7(1/4)\u00b712 = O(1). Empirically, the only levels with noticeable (unweighted) decreases are those with L_j\u2208{2,4,8} (adjacent to L), consistent with \u201chome-scale\u201d concentration.\n- For L=1 (singletons paired), the geometric-window lemma still bounds the windowed decrease by O(1), despite the possibility that \u0398(log n) levels see constant-factor unweighted changes. This illustrates the necessity of scale-sensitive weights.\n\nObstacles\n- The geometric-window lemma is \u201cfirst-step only.\u201d Without a characterization of T_j(A) after a step, we cannot iterate the bound. A naive attempt to keep measuring against G_j (of A_0) does not telescope to a lower bound on sorting time.\n- The extremal bound yields only O(log(n/L)) control on \u03a3_j Decrease_j/B_j(A_0); taken over \u0398(log n) scales this still gives merely \u03a9(log n) steps for the unweighted potential.\n- A signed cross-level inequality (bounding a weighted combination of decreases and increases that correlates with |log B_j\u2212(d\u2212j)|) remains open. The Hamming-sum identity suggests such cancellation might be possible with carefully chosen weights, but a precise bound is not yet proved.\n\nNext steps (actionable)\n1) Curate the extremal 2-adic bound and the geometric-window lemma into output.md (after verifier checks), as they are exact and broadly useful.\n2) Search for persistence of arithmetic regularity: After an equal-scale step from A_0 at scale L, characterize T_j(A) for j with L_j\u2248L. Goal: show these boundary sets are unions of a bounded number of arithmetic progressions with large modulus, enabling a rerun of the geometric-window argument at the next step.\n3) Signed per-index inequality: For a single changed index i (arbitrary A), analyze the vector over j of contributions to B_j(A\u2032)\u2212B_j(A) via HD_{A\u2032}(i)\u2212HD_A(i). Try weights of the form a_j(L)=\u03b3^{| (d\u22121\u2212j) \u2212 \u2113 |}/2^{j+1} with \u03b3<1/2 and prove \u03a3_j a_j(L)\u00b7(B_j(A\u2032)\u2212B_j(A)) \u2264 O(L/n) uniformly in A. This would extend the geometric-window lemma beyond A_0.\n4) Restricted-phase milestone: Under the equal-scale assumption per phase, define a phase potential \u03a8_L(A):=\u03a3_j \u03b2^{|log_2 L_j\u2212log_2 L|}\u00b7|log_2 B_j(A)\u2212(d\u2212j)| and prove an O(1) drop per phase from A_0 using the geometric-window lemma (for the \u201cdecrease-needed\u201d half) together with a symmetric variant for increases. This would yield \u03a9(log^2 n) steps for the restricted model.\n5) Case analysis for per-pair decreases: Classify the six-bit patterns (a_L,L_1,L_k,R_1,R_m,a_R) that yield \u0394_pair(j)<0 and quantify when the inner boundary must coincide with a current j-boundary. This may lead to a \u201ccentral-boundary demand\u201d lemma needed to control decreases when T_j(A) has partial regularity.\n\nWhy this is progress\n- The extremal 2-adic inequality closes a missing technical gap and makes several prior sketches rigorous.\n- The geometric-window lemma is a genuinely new, constant-per-step cross-level bound (albeit for the first step), capturing scale-locality in a quantitative way. It provides a clear template for the type of weighting that could ultimately yield an \u03a9(log^2 n) lower bound via an O(1) per-phase drop argument.\n"
