  "summary_md": "This round produced two complementary, rigorous first-step bounds at the dyadic start A_0 and their immediate corollaries. Prover-01 gives a 2-adic \u201clayer-cake\u201d inequality bounding \u03a3_{i\u2208S} 2^{v_2(i)} \u2264 C\u00b7n\u00b7(1+log_2(n/m)) (m = number of matched pairs), and uses toggle-locality + the dyadic identity to prove the small-scale fractional bound\n\u03a3_{j: L_j<L} Decrease_j/B_j(A_0) \u2264 (2/(nL))\u00b7\u03a3_{i\u2208S}2^{v_2(i)} \u2264 C\u00b7(1+log(n/m))/L,\nso equal-scale [L,2L) steps give O((log L)/L). Prover-02 supplies an extremal 2-adic sum lemma \u03a3_{i\u2208S}2^{v_2(i)} \u2264 N\u00b7H_K and a geometric-window lemma: with weights a_j(L)=\u03b2^{| (d\u22121\u2212j) \u2212 \u2113 |}/2^{j+1} one has \u03a3_j a_j(L)\u00b7Decrease_j \u2264 C_\u03b2\u00b7(L/n)\u00b7|S|, hence O(1) per equal-scale step. Together these plug the verifier\u2019s missing Inequality 2 and give concrete scale-sensitive scarcity at A_0. Main limitation: all results are first-step (A=A_0) and must be extended (via signed per-index bounds or persistence of arithmetic regularity) to iterate phases.

    "Extremal 2-adic sum (prover-02): \u03a3_{i\u2208S}2^{v_2(i)} \u2264 N\u00b7H_K, yielding coarse global bound \u03a3_j Decrease_j/B_j(A_0) = O(log(n/L)).",

    "Key limitation: all lemmas use the dyadic identity at A_0 (T_j(A_0)=G_j); extending beyond the first step is open and necessary to iterate phase arguments."

  "next_questions": [
    "Curate the new items into output.md: add the 2-adic layer-cake lemma, the small-scale fractional-decrease theorem + corollaries, the extremal 2-adic lemma, and the geometric-window lemma; verify constants and link them to Theorem 8 and Theorem 5.",
    "Define a phase potential \u03a8_L (geometric/scale-centered weights) and prove an O(1) drop per equal-scale phase by combining Theorem 8 (large scales), the new small-scale bound, and case handling for large relative drops (using the factor-3 cap).",
    "Extend first-step bounds beyond A_0: pursue either (a) a signed per-index inequality bounding \u03a3_j w_j\u00b7(B_j(A')\u2212B_j(A)) uniformly in A for suitable weights, or (b) prove persistence/structure of T_j(A) after an L-scale step (arithmetic-progressions decomposition) so the geometric-window argument can be reapplied."
