Prover-01 gives a 2-adic “layer-cake” inequality bounding Σ_{i∈S} 2^{v_2(i)} ≤ C·n·(1+log_2(n/m)) (m = number of matched pairs), and uses toggle-locality + the dyadic identity to prove the small-scale fractional bound\\nΣ_{j: L_j<L} Decrease_j/B_j(A_0) ≤ (2/(nL))·Σ_{i∈S}2^{v_2(i)} ≤ C·(1+log(n/m))/L,\\nso equal-scale [L,2L) steps give O((log L)/L). Prover-02 supplies an extremal 2-adic sum lemma Σ_{i∈S}2^{v_2(i)} ≤ N·H_K and a geometric-window lemma: with weights a_j(L)=β^{| (d−1−j) − ℓ |}/2^{j+1} one has Σ_j a_j(L)·Decrease_j ≤ C_β·(L/n)·|S|, hence O(1) per equal-scale step. Together these plug the verifier’s missing Inequality 2 and give concrete scale-sensitive scarcity at A_0. Main limitation: all results are first-step (A=A_0) and must be extended (via signed per-index bounds or persistence of arithmetic regularity) to iterate phases.
