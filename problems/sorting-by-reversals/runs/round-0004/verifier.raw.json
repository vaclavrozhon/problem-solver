Prover 01’s main structural inequality (the small-scale fractional bound at A0 using the 2-adic weights) is also essentially correct, but two technical slips need correction, and the claimed layer-cake bound has a wrong logarithmic dependence.\\n\\nSpecific audits and corrections\\n- Small-scale fractional bound (01): The derivation using toggle-locality and the weighted dyadic identity at A0 is sound with weights a_j=(1/L)·1_{L_j<L}·2^{-(j+1)}. However, when moving to the inner sum over j for a fixed i, the indicator 1_{L_j<L} was dropped as “=” instead of “≤”. The correct chain is Σ_{j: L_j<L} Decrease_j/B_j(A0) ≤ (1/L) Σ_{i∈S} Σ_{j: i∈G_j, L_j<L} 2^{-(j+1)} ≤ (1/L) Σ_{i∈S} Σ_{j: i∈G_j} 2^{-(j+1)} = (2/(nL)) Σ_{i∈S} 2^{v_2(i)}. This yields the claimed (2/(nL)) multiplier.\\n- 2-adic layer-cake bound (01): The counting trick is fine, but the final estimate should scale like n·(1+log m), not n·(1+log(n/m)). Indeed, with |S|≤3m and letting N=n−1, one finds Σ_{i∈S}2^{v_2(i)} ≤ 2·[3m·2^{t_0+1}+N·(T−t_0)] = O(N + N·log(3m)) = O(n·log m), where T≈log_2 N and t_0≈log_2(N/(3m)). Prover 02’s extremal bound Σ_{i∈S}2^{v_2(i)} ≤ N·H_{|S|} subsumes this and is sharp up to constant factors.\\n- Equal-scale specialization (01): From the corrected inequality Σ_{j: L_j<L} Decrease_j/B_j(A0) ≤ (2/(nL)) Σ_{i∈S}2^{v_2(i)} and the extremal bound with K=|S|≤3m≤3n/L, the correct consequence is Σ_{j: L_j<L} Decrease_j/B_j(A0) ≤ O((log(n/L))/L). The claimed O((log L)/L) does not follow in general (log(n/m)≥log L for m≤n/L).\\n- Extremal 2-adic bound (02): The proof via ordering the weights w(i)=2^{v_2(i)} and using s_ℓ≤N/ℓ is correct and sharp. It fills the missing technical step needed to bound Σ_i 2^{v_2(i)}.\\n- Geometric-window lemma (02): The per-index bound Σ_{j: i∈G_j} a_j(L) ≤ C_β·(L/n), with β∈(0,1/2), is correct; splitting the sum at s=ℓ and summing two geometric series yields the stated constant C_β=1/(1−β/2)+1/(1−2β). This gives an O(1) bound per equal-scale step from A0.\\n\\nWhat we curate now\\n- We add (i) the extremal 2-adic sum bound; (ii) the small-scale fractional decrease bound at A0 with its corollaries (including the equal-scale O((log(n/L))/L) version); and (iii) the geometric-window weighted cross-level bound at A0.\\n\\nPromising directions and next steps\\n- Equal-scale phase potential: combine Theorem 8 (large-scale weighted decreases) with the new small-scale O((log(n/L))/L) bound and the geometric-window lemma to define a geometric, scale-centered potential that drops by O(1) per equal-scale phase. Make the treatment of large relative drops precise using the factor-3 cap.\\n- Beyond the first step: pursue (a) persistence of arithmetic regularity of T_j(A) near the home scale after a near-L step, and (b) a signed per-index inequality (via Hamming-sum ideas) that is uniform in A. Either would let us iterate the O(1) per-phase drop without re-initializing at A0.\\n- Central-boundary demand: carry out the six-bit case analysis to prove that large decreases at level j require Ω(B_j) inner-boundary hits, enabling stronger control of which indices in S matter.\\n- Sanity checks: small-n experiments to probe tightness of the O((log(n/L))/L) bound and the constants in the geometric-window lemma.\\n\",\"new_notes_md\":\"New rigorously verified bounds from A_0 (bit-reversal start)\\n\\n- Extremal 2-adic sum bound.

This strongly motivates a phase potential centered at L and a proof of O(1) drop per equal-scale phase.\\n\\nNext steps (refined)\\n1) Formalize an equal-scale phase potential that combines Theorem 8 with the small-scale bound and handles large relative drops via the factor-3 cap; target an O(1) drop per phase starting at A_0.\\n2) Extend beyond the first step: either show arithmetic regularity for \\\\(T_j(A)\\\\) near the home scale persists (enough to reapply the geometric-window argument), or prove a signed per-index inequality uniform in A, guided by the Hamming-sum identity.\\n3) Prove a central-boundary demand lemma via a six-bit case analysis, quantifying the necessary inner-boundary hits for large decreases at a fixed j.\\n\",\"new_notes_append\":\"True\",\"new_outputs_md\":\"Lemma 9 (Extremal 2-adic sum bound).\\nLet N\\\\ge 1 and S\\\\subseteq\\\\{1,\\\\dots,N\\\\} with |S|=K\\\\ge 1.
