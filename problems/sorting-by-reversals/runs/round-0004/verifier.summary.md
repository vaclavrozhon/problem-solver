Overall assessment: both reports contain useful and largely correct ideas; Prover 02’s two lemmas are clean, correct, and directly curatable. Prover 01’s main structural inequality (the small-scale fractional bound at A0 using the 2-adic weights) is also essentially correct, but two technical slips need correction, and the claimed layer-cake bound has a wrong logarithmic dependence.
