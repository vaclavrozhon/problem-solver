This packages Theorem 10 across steps and will be the backbone of any phase-by-scale lower bound.\n- Quantified demand at high levels: the fractional decrease required at levels j \u2265 \u2308(d\u22121)/2\u2309 is uniformly \u2126(1). I record the precise constants. This specifies the \u201camount of work\u201d each top-half level must accumulate.\n- Per-pair six-bit case analysis plan: I outline a finitary classification to separate decreases paid by inner vs. outer boundaries, aiming toward a \u201ccentral-boundary demand\u201d lemma. I state two easy necessary conditions that can be verified locally.\n- Caution: The present tools still fall short of a full \u2126(log^2 n) bound in the unrestricted model; I explain crisply where the aggregation bottleneck lies and what additional structure/invariants would close it.\n\nMulti-step geometric-window aggregation (first-step from A_0)\n- Definition. For a step t with home scale L_t=2^{\u2113_t}, let the per-step fractional decreases at level j be q_{t,j}:=Decrease_j^{(t)}/B_j(A_0). For \u03b2\u2208(0,1/2), define the geometric window weight a_{t,j}:=\u03b2^{| (d\u22121\u2212j) \u2212 \u2113_t |}.\n- Lemma (multi-step aggregation). For any T-step schedule from A_0 consisting of equal-scale steps (one scale per step, but scales may vary with t),\n  \u2211_{t=1}^T \u2211_{j=0}^{d\u22121} a_{t,j}\u00b7q_{t,j} \u2264 C_\u03b2\u00b7T,\n  where C_\u03b2 is as in Theorem 10.\n  Proof sketch. Theorem 10 says per step \u2211_j a_{t,j}\u00b7q_{t,j} \u2264 C_\u03b2. Summation over t yields the claim. This is exact and testable.\n- Immediate corollary (profiling by a schedule). Let Q_j:=\u2211_{t} q_{t,j} be the total fractional decrease accumulated at level j after T steps, and define the schedule profile W_j:=\u2211_{t} a_{t,j}. Then\n  \u2211_{j=0}^{d\u22121} W_j\u00b7Q_j \u2264 C_\u03b2\u00b7T.\n  This inequality decouples algorithm choices (W_j depends only on the chosen scales \u2113_t) from \u201cwork demands\u201d (Q_j).\n\nRequired fractional decrease at high levels\n- For j\u2265j_0:=\u2308(d\u22121)/2\u2309, the required fractional decrease to reach sorted is\n  Q_j^\u22c6 := 1 \u2212 B_j(A_*)/B_j(A_0) = 1 \u2212 2^{d\u2212j}/2^{j+1} = 1 \u2212 2^{d\u22122j\u22121}.\n  Hence Q_j^\u22c6 \u2265 1/2 for all j\u2265j_0. In particular, with J_high:={j_0,\u2026,d\u22121},\n  \u2211_{j\u2208J_high} Q_j^\u22c6 \u2265 (d\u2212j_0+1)/2 = \u0398(d) = \u0398(log n).\n- Why useful here. This quantifies that each high-level must accumulate a constant fractional decrease, totaling \u0398(log n) units across all high levels. When paired with the schedule-profiled inequality above, this forces the schedule to supply enough \u201cwindow mass\u201d near each of these levels.\n\nObstacle to a direct \u2126(log^2 n) bound (and what is missing)\n- The aggregated inequality gives \u2211_j W_j\u00b7Q_j \u2264 C_\u03b2 T. Since \u2211_{j\u2208J_high} Q_j^\u22c6=\u0398(d), to deduce T=\u2126(d^2) one needs a uniform lower bound W_j \u2265 c>0 for all j\u2208J_high. That is false in general: an adversarial schedule can set most \u2113_t far from a given j, making W_j tiny even for large T.\n- What would suffice: a complementary \u201coff-window inefficiency\u201d statement, e.g., a per-step unweighted cap q_{t,j} \u2264 g(|(d\u22121\u2212j)\u2212\u2113_t|) with g decaying exponentially in the distance. Then\n  Q_j \u2264 \u2211_t g(|(d\u22121\u2212j)\u2212\u2113_t|) would imply a lower bound on W_j (up to constants) and yield T=\u2126(d^2). Our current Theorem 10 proves only a weighted cap (windowed sum per step), not an unweighted per-level cap.\n\nToward a central-boundary demand lemma (per-pair local structure)\n- Per-pair six-bit pattern. For a single swapped pair (L,R) at a fixed level j, the contribution \u0394_pair(j) depends only on the 6 bits (a_L, L_1, L_k, R_1, R_m, a_R). Exhaustively classifying these 2^6 cases will give exact conditions for when \u0394_pair(j)<0 and which among the three indices must belong to T_j(A).\n- Two immediate necessary conditions (local, exact):\n  1) If none of the three changed indices lies in T_j(A), then \u0394_pair(j) \u2265 0. Reason: by toggle-locality Decrease_j \u2264 |T_j(A)\u2229S_pair|=0.\n  2) If exactly one of the three changed indices lies in T_j(A) and it is an outer boundary, then \u0394_pair(j) \u2265 \u22121. Reason: Decrease_j \u2264 |T_j(A)\u2229S_pair|=1.\n- Why useful. Aggregated over pairs, these imply that any \u0398(B_j)-scale decrease at level j must be paid by \u03a9(B_j) hits of T_j(A) across pair interfaces. To make this quantitative and scale-sensitive we need to further show that outer-boundary hits are too few off-scale (only 2m total per step), forcing substantial inner-boundary alignment at scale L_j, which is incompatible across many j due to 2-adic constraints. The 6-bit classification is the finite, verifiable base case to formalize this.\n\nA modest aligned-step upper bound (first-step, equal-scale, dyadic)\n- Claim (inner-boundary intersection fraction under exact L-grid alignment at A_0). If inner boundaries are all on an L-grid, then for any level j the fraction of inner boundaries at indices in G_j is min{1, L/L_j}. Consequently, in such a step Decrease_j \u2264 2m + m\u00b7min{1, L/L_j}, and \n  q_j=Decrease_j/B_j(A_0) \u2264 O(min{1, L_j/L}).\n- Why only a partial result. The fraction bound rests on exact L-alignment; without alignment (the general case) inner boundaries can be adversarially distributed. However, this result is good to curate under an \u201caligned-equal-scale\u201d restriction and is consistent with previously observed small-scale scarcity.\n\nExamples and sanity checks (n=16)\n- Let L=4 and j=3 (L_j=1). The aligned inner-boundary fraction is 1, so inner hits can be as many as m and outer hits 2m, giving Decrease_3 \u2264 3m; with m\u2264n/L=4, this yields Decrease_3\u226412, while B_3(A_0)=16. Hence one L=4 step cannot halve B_3; two or three steps may, consistent with the factor-3 cap.\n- Let L=8 and j=1 (L_j=4). The fraction is L/L_j=2, capped at 1, so inner hits \u2264 m, outer hits \u22642m, Decrease_1\u22643m with m\u2264n/L=2 \u21d2 Decrease_1\u22646 while B_1(A_0)=4, so a single step can more than halve B_1; matches the observation that coarse steps impact coarse levels strongly.\n\nGaps or issues in output.md\n- Lemma 7.2 uses the phrase \u201cthe three changed indices lie in an index interval of length s\u201d. Pedantically, the distance between the two outers is |L|+|R|+1, so the interval length is s+1; the conclusion \u201c<L_j hence contains at most one multiple of L_j\u201d still holds unchanged. No substantive correction needed, but the wording could be tightened.\n- All other curated items (Theorems 8\u201310 and Corollaries) remain correct and consistent with the new aggregation view.\n\nNext steps (concrete, testable)\n1) Curate the multi-step aggregation lemma and its corollary (profiled inequality) for first-step-from-A_0 schedules of equal-scale steps. This is an immediate and rigorous extension of Theorem 10.\n2) Execute the six-bit case analysis for \u0394_pair(j) and extract a precise statement: characterize when decreases of magnitude 2 (or 1) necessarily involve the inner boundary landing in T_j(A) either before or after. This will formalize a \u201ccentral-boundary demand\u201d per pair.\n3) Aligned-step bound: fully write the proof that under exact L-grid alignment at A_0, q_j\u2264O(min{1, L_j/L}), and combine with Theorem 8 to give an O(1) per-phase drop for a geometric windowed potential. This would yield an \u2126(log^2 n) bound for the aligned-equal-scale restricted model.\n4) Attempt a near-alignment averaging: partition pairs by the residue of their inner boundary modulo L; pigeonhole to extract a 1/L-fraction aligned subfamily and apply the aligned analysis to that fraction. Quantify the loss and see whether an O(1) per-phase drop survives.\n5) Small-n experiments (n=32,64) to enumerate random equal-scale steps from A_0 and measure (i) the per-step geometric-windowed sum \u2211_j \u03b2^{|\u2026|} q_{t,j}, (ii) the number of j with q_{t,j}\u22651/2, and (iii) how alignment of inner boundaries mod L affects (i) and (ii). These will guide the constants in the aligned-step bound.\n\nWhy this is progress\n- The multi-step aggregation inequality is a clean, checkable packaging of Theorem 10 across steps, separating schedule choices (W_j) from level-wise work (Q_j). It precisely identifies the missing piece needed for a full \u2126(log^2 n) lower bound.\n- The quantified high-level demand pins down that \u0398(log n) units of fractional decrease must be delivered across the top-half levels, a fact that any candidate lower bound must leverage.\n- The six-bit per-pair classification agenda is a finite, implementable path toward a central-boundary demand lemma, which is the most promising avenue to obtain off-window inefficiency in the general (unaligned) setting.\n"
