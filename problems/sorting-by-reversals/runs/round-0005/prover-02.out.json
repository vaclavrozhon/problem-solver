This removes the dependence on dyadic alignment and lets us bound windowed decreases purely by per-index bit-difference accounting.\n- Multi-bin aggregation: Partitioning a step\u2019s pairs by dyadic size and summing the windowed-decrease bounds across bins yields a universal O(1) bound per step (independent of A): \u03a3_bins \u03a3_j a_j(L_bin)\u00b7Decrease_j \u2264 O(1).\n- Six-bit toggle classification: I formalize exact conditions for decreases/increases at the left outer, inner, and right outer interfaces of a single pair at level j in terms of the six endpoint j-bits (a_L,L_1,L_k,R_1,R_m,a_R). Two immediate corollaries quantify necessary conditions for outer decreases, and an incompatibility between \u201cboth outers decrease\u201d and \u201ccenter increases\u201d.\n- Candid obstacle: even with the multi-bin O(1) bound of windowed decreases, a straightforward window-summed potential seems to start at \u0398(log n) (not \u0398(log^2 n)) at A_0, so it cannot, by itself, force \u03a9(log^2 n) steps. This sharpens where the remaining difficulty lies: we likely need a more global potential (e.g., threshold-sum style) or a signed per-index inequality to couple decreases (beneficial at large j) with increases (beneficial at small j).\n\nNew lemmas (rigorous, ready to curate)\n1) Geometric-window decrease bound uniform in A.\n- Setup: Let n=2^d. Fix \u03b2\u2208(0,1/2) and a home scale L=2^\u2113. Define a_j(L):=\u03b2^{| (d\u22121\u2212j) \u2212 \u2113 |}/2^{j+1}.\n- Lemma (GW-uniform). For any array A, any single step A\u2192A\u2032 with changed-index set S,\n  \u03a3_{j=0}^{d\u22121} a_j(L)\u00b7Decrease_j \u2264 C_\u03b2\u00b7(L/n)\u00b7|S|, where C_\u03b2:=1/(1\u2212\u03b2/2)+1/(1\u22122\u03b2).\n- Proof sketch (fully formalizable): Toggle-locality gives \u03a3_j a_j(L)\u00b7Decrease_j \u2264 \u03a3_{i\u2208S} \u03a3_j a_j(L)\u00b71_{i\u2208T_j(A)}. For a fixed changed index i, let the adjacent values before the step be x,y\u2208{0,\u2026,n\u22121}; then 1_{i\u2208T_j(A)} equals [bit_j(x)\u2260bit_j(y)]. Writing s=d\u22121\u2212j, we have\n  \u03a3_j a_j(L)\u00b71_{i\u2208T_j(A)} = 2^{\u2212d} \u03a3_{s: bit_{d\u22121\u2212s}(x)\u2295bit_{d\u22121\u2212s}(y)=1} \u03b2^{|s\u2212\u2113|}\u00b72^{s} \u2264 2^{\u2212d} \u03a3_{s=0}^{d\u22121} \u03b2^{|s\u2212\u2113|} 2^{s} \u2264 C_\u03b2\u00b7(L/n).\n  Summing over i\u2208S yields the claim. Note no use of A_0 is made.\n- Comment on output.md: Theorem 10 is currently stated \u201cat A_0\u201d. The above proof shows the same inequality holds for arbitrary A (with the same constant), so Theorem 10 can be strengthened accordingly.\n\n2) Multi-bin aggregation: O(1) total windowed decreases per step.\n- Setup: In a step, partition the matched pairs into dyadic size-bins Bt: pairs with total span s(p)\u2208[2^t,2^{t+1}). Let S_t be the set of changed indices contributed by Bt. For each bin define L_t:=2^t and weights a_j(L_t) as above.\n- Proposition (multi-bin O(1)). For any array A and any step A\u2192A\u2032,\n  \u03a3_t \u03a3_j a_j(L_t)\u00b7Decrease_j \u2264 3C_\u03b2.\n- Proof. By GW-uniform, \u03a3_j a_j(L_t)\u00b7Decrease_j \u2264 C_\u03b2\u00b7(L_t/n)|S_t|. Since each pair contributes at most three changed indices, |S_t| \u2264 3\u00b7|Bt|. Moreover, for each pair p\u2208Bt we have L_t \u2264 s(p), hence L_t\u00b7|S_t| \u2264 3 \u03a3_{p\u2208Bt} s(p). Summing across t, we get \u03a3_t L_t\u00b7|S_t| \u2264 3 \u03a3_p s(p) \u2264 3n (the pair-unions are disjoint). Therefore \u03a3_t \u03a3_j a_j(L_t)\u00b7Decrease_j \u2264 (C_\u03b2/n)\u00b7\u03a3_t L_t|S_t| \u2264 3C_\u03b2.\n- Significance. This gives a universal \u201cconservation law across scales\u201d for decreases: in any step, even if pairs of many sizes are used, the total windowed decrease budget across all dyadic scales is O(1), independent of A and n.\n\nSix-bit interface classification (exact, local, and useful)\n- Notation at level j (two-coloring by j-th bit): Let x:=a_L (color left of L), y:=L_1, z:=L_k, u:=R_1, v:=R_m, w:=a_R \u2208{0,1}.\n- Pre-swap boundary indicators at the three interfaces:\n  b_L^pre=[x\u2260y], b_C^pre=[z\u2260u], b_R^pre=[v\u2260w].\n- Post-swap adjacency flips (after swapping L and R): left outer between x and u, inner between v and y, right outer between z and w. Thus\n  b_L^post=[x\u2260u], b_C^post=[v\u2260y], b_R^post=[z\u2260w].\n- Decrease at an index means 1\u21920; increase means 0\u21921. Therefore the per-interface conditions are:\n  \u2022 Left outer: decrease iff x\u2260y and x=u; increase iff x=y and x\u2260u.\n  \u2022 Center: decrease iff z\u2260u and v=y; increase iff z=u and v\u2260y.\n  \u2022 Right outer: decrease iff v\u2260w and z=w; increase iff v=w and z\u2260w.\n- Corollary 1 (outer-decrease necessities). If the left outer decreases then u\u2260y; if the right outer decreases then v\u2260z. Thus any outer decrease certifies a mismatch at the corresponding inner endpoints.\n- Corollary 2 (two-outers-decrease preclude center-increase). If both outers decrease (i.e., x=u\u2260y and z=w\u2260v), then the center cannot increase. Indeed, center increase requires z=u and v\u2260y; with x=u and z=w, this would force simultaneously v\u2260u and v\u2260y, impossible in {0,1}.\n- Why useful. These exact conditions are the correct replacement for earlier \u201cuseful adjacency\u201d heuristics. They are finite-case, verifiable, and will be the basis for any inner-vs-outer demand lemma: large decreases at level j should require many center hits (v=y and z\u2260u), not predominantly outer hits. We will next try to quantify this at scale.\n\nExamples (sanity checks at n=8)\n- Take any pair (L,R) with union length s=2 that straddles a unique j-boundary. Then at that j the left outer often decreases (x\u2260y and x=u), while the right outer cannot simultaneously decrease unless v\u2260z; center decrease requires v=y, showing the tension among the three interfaces captured above.\n- Constructed patterns confirm Corollary 2: when both outer decreases occur, forcing x=u and z=w with y\u2260u and v\u2260z, the center\u2019s 0\u21921 toggle is impossible.\n\nHow this advances the program\n- The GW-uniform lemma removes the reliance on A_0 and establishes a clean per-index bound for windowed decreases. The multi-bin aggregation is a robust O(1) trade-off per step across all dyadic scales. Together they provide a rigorous, A-agnostic \u201cdecrease budget\u201d that applies to every step.\n- The six-bit classification gives an exact local language to separate inner vs. outer contributions and to design a central-boundary demand lemma (still to be proved): e.g., a target statement of the form \u201cto achieve \u03b8\u00b7B_j(A) total decreases at level j, at least c\u03b8\u00b7B_j(A) must come from center hits\u201d is now a concrete combinatorial objective amenable to case analysis.\n\nObstacles and why this does not yet imply \u03a9(log^2 n)\n- Window-summed potentials. If we define a per-scale window potential P_\u2113(A)=\u03a3_j a_j(2^\u2113)\u00b7(B_j(A)\u2212B_j(A_*)) restricted to the large-j half (where decreases are beneficial), then \u03a3_\u2113 P_\u2113(A_0)=\u0398(log n), not \u0398(log^2 n) (since \u03a3_\u2113 \u03b2^{|s\u2212\u2113|} is O(1) for each s and there are \u0398(log n) values of s). Thus the multi-bin O(1) drop per step would only yield \u03a9(log n) steps via this potential. A different aggregation (e.g., threshold-sum or signed log-gap) is needed to reach \u0398(log^2 n).\n- Signed progress and increases. For small j, beneficial progress is via increases of B_j. Our current decrease-only budget does not constrain such increases. A per-index signed inequality of the form \u03a3_j w_j\u00b7(1_{i\u2208T_j(A\u2032)}\u22121_{i\u2208T_j(A)}) \u2264 C (with suitably chosen weights w_j) would enable controlling both directions. Designing such weights remains open.\n\nGaps or adjustments to output.md\n- Theorem 10 (Geometric-window weighted cross-level bound at A_0): as shown above, the A_0 hypothesis is unnecessary. The proof goes through verbatim for arbitrary A by interpreting 1_{i\u2208T_j(A)} as the j-th bit XOR at the adjacent values across i. I recommend restating Theorem 10 as a uniform-in-A inequality. The equal-scale O(1) corollary remains valid.\n- A new proposition (multi-bin O(1)) should be added. It formalizes that even when a step mixes many sizes, the sum over dyadic bins of the windowed decrease budgets is universally O(1).\n- No other inconsistencies spotted with the currently curated Theorems 8\u20139 and Lemma 9; keep the A_0 dependence where it is crucial (Theorem 9), and highlight the new A-agnostic window bound separately.\n\nNext steps (concrete, testable)\n1) Curate the GW-uniform lemma and the multi-bin O(1) proposition into output.md. These are fully rigorous and generalize existing bounds.\n2) Central-boundary demand via six-bit analysis: For fixed j, classify per-pair patterns that produce an outer decrease but not a center decrease, and prove that in any step the number of such \u201couter-only\u201d decreases is O(# of disjoint j-boundaries) while achieving \u03b8\u00b7B_j(A) total decreases necessitates \u03a9(\u03b8\u00b7B_j(A)) center hits. Start with the regime where pair unions cover a 1\u2212o(1) fraction of positions (to limit adjacencies available for outer-only hits).\n3) Toward a signed per-index inequality (uniform in A): Attempt to bound, for each changed index i, the absolute value of \u03a3_j w_j\u00b7(1_{i\u2208T_j(A\u2032)}\u22121_{i\u2208T_j(A)}) by O(1) for a cleverly chosen weight profile w_j that, when summed across dyadic bins (as in the multi-bin proposition), yields an O(1) per-step cap on the drop of a threshold-sum potential of the form \u03a8(A)=\u03a3_{k=0}^{d\u22121} \u03b1_k\u00b7\u03a3_{j\u2265k} |log_2(B_j(A))\u2212(d\u2212j)|. The choice of \u03b1_k should make \u03a8(A_0)=\u0398(d^2) while keeping per-step drop bounded (this is the main technical challenge).\n4) Small-n experiments (n\u2208{32,64,128}) to measure: (a) the fraction of decreases at a fixed j attributable to center vs. outers in random steps; (b) saturation of the multi-bin O(1) bound; (c) empirical candidates for weight profiles w_j in step 3.\n5) Extend Theorem 9\u2019s small-scale fractional bound beyond the first step by proving that in the absence of strong alignment, large relative decreases at very small scales still require many center hits (thereby tying back to step 2). This would allow iteration of A_0-based arguments.\n\nWhy this counts as progress\n- The GW-uniform lemma and the multi-bin O(1) proposition are new, rigorous statements that materially strengthen the toolkit and remove nonessential dependencies on A_0. They quantify a robust, per-step, global scarcity of decreases across scales.\n- The six-bit classification pinpoints the combinatorial structure at a single pair and provides clear necessary conditions; it is the right foundation for a center-demand lemma.\n- The obstacles are crisply identified: any \u03a9(log^2 n) lower bound must either (i) incorporate increases via a signed per-index inequality, or (ii) prove a strong central-demand phenomenon that throttles effective progress simultaneously across many scales. The next steps target both fronts with concrete, testable subgoals."
