In this round, the prover focused on establishing a lower bound of Omega(log^2 n) for sorting bit-reversal sequences through the formulation of two key lemmas. Lemma 1 addresses the constant-factor cap on changes to $B_j$ per step, while Lemma 2 limits the number of levels affected by a swap. Both lemmas require rigorous justification to ensure their validity. Empirical testing on small cases (n=2^k for k=1,2,3) was proposed to gather evidence, but it should be complemented with theoretical analysis. Additionally, the relationship between the counting lower bound and the potential function $Φ(A)$ needs further exploration.

In this round, two significant lemmas were proposed: Lemma 1 establishes a constant-factor cap on changes in monochromatic runs at a fixed bit level, while Lemma 2 asserts that a matched boundary only affects a constant number of nearby bit levels. Both lemmas are crucial for proving the overall lower bound but require rigorous justification. Initial test attempts with small cases (n=8 and n=16) were conducted to analyze the effects of swaps, and the potential function Φ(A) was explored to track changes. The relationship between counting arguments and the potential function was also examined, highlighting the need for coherence in the proof. Overall, the direction of the research is promising, but further rigor is essential for advancement.
