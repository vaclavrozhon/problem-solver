In this round, the prover focused on establishing a lower bound of Omega(log^2 n) for sorting bit-reversal sequences through the formulation of two key lemmas. Lemma 1 addresses the constant-factor cap on changes to $B_j$ per step, while Lemma 2 limits the number of levels affected by a swap. Both lemmas require rigorous justification to ensure their validity. Empirical testing on small cases (n=2^k for k=1,2,3) was proposed to gather evidence, but it should be complemented with theoretical analysis. Additionally, the relationship between the counting lower bound and the potential function $Φ(A)$ needs further exploration.

In this round, two significant lemmas were proposed: Lemma 1 establishes a constant-factor cap on changes in monochromatic runs at a fixed bit level, while Lemma 2 asserts that a matched boundary only affects a constant number of nearby bit levels. Both lemmas are crucial for proving the overall lower bound but require rigorous justification. Initial test attempts with small cases (n=8 and n=16) were conducted to analyze the effects of swaps, and the potential function Φ(A) was explored to track changes. The relationship between counting arguments and the potential function was also examined, highlighting the need for coherence in the proof. Overall, the direction of the research is promising, but further rigor is essential for advancement.

This round formalized that our single-step model = PBT (parallel adjacent block transpositions, JOP arXiv:2311.08727) and set a concrete potential Φ(A)=∑_j D_j(A) with D_j(A)=|log2 B_j(A)−(d−j)|; for bit-reversal A0 this Φ(A0)=Θ(d^2). Two complementary threads produced rigorous local bounds: a per-level constant-factor cap on B_j change in one step (prover-01 gave a factor-4 bound; prover-02 refined the argument to c=7 via careful edge counting), and a size-sensitive bound Δ_j ≤ C·∑_p min{1, s(p)/L_j} tying level-j progress to swapped-pair sizes. A dyadic alignment lemma shows any cut index is “useful” for only O(log n) levels. These tools recover the known Ω(log n) lower bound but do not yet yield Ω(d^2)=Ω(log^2 n): the missing ingredient is a robust cross-level scarcity (only O(1) levels can get constant-factor progress in one step). Next steps target a “home-level” charging argument and small-n enumeration to validate constants. Citations: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json; Jelínek–Opler–Pekárek (arXiv:2311.08727).

## round-0002 — model summary — 2025-08-27T19:46:36.085312Z
This round produced two complementary technical advances and a clear programmatic path. Prover-01 introduced the toggle-locality identity: for any single PBT step with changed-adjacency set S, B_j(A')−B_j(A)=|T_j(A')∩S|−|T_j(A)∩S|, and the immediate one-sided corollary Decrease_j ≤ |T_j(A)∩S| (and symmetrically for increases). It also restated the A_0 alignment count Σ_j |S∩G_j| = Σ_{i∈S}(1+v_2(i)) (weighted form included). Prover-02 fixed a proof gap and proved a tight per-pair ±2 contribution bound, yielding a per-level factor-3 cap B_j(A') ≤ 3 B_j(A). Both files give a clean equal-scale first-step scarcity claim from A_0: when all pairs have size ≈L, only O(1) adjacent dyadic levels near L can undergo constant-factor change. Remaining gaps: extending equal-scale scarcity beyond the first step and proving a robust home-level charging lemma. Files relied on: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json.

This round develops two usable cross-level inequalities for L-grid-aligned steps from A_0 and a universal “pair-budget” lemma, and it overturns the earlier “O(1) active levels per step” hope. The pair-budget lemma gives Decrease_j ≤ |T_j(A)∩S| ≤ |S| ≤ 3m and forces m ≥ (θ/3)·B_j(A) to realize a θ-fraction drop at level j. For A_0 and steps with pairs of size in [L,2L) whose inner boundaries lie on the L-grid the authors prove: (1) a large-scale weighted bound Σ_{L_j≥L} (L/L_j)·Decrease_j ≤ 2|S| ≤ 6m ≤ 6n/L, and (2) a small-scale fractional bound Σ_{L_j<L} Decrease_j/B_j(A_0) = O((log(n/L))/L) (the latter reduces to bounding Σ_{i∈S} 2^{v2(i)} = O(m·2^ℓ(1+log(n/L))). A concrete counterexample shows an L=1 aligned step can give constant-factor drops at Θ(log n) levels, so a flat “O(1) active levels” lemma is false. A realistic route is a restricted phase-by-scale model (equal-scale, grid-aligned phases) with a geometric-weighted potential Ψ_t; proving an O(1) per-phase drop there would imply Ω(log^2 n).

## round-0004 — model summary — 2025-08-27T20:23:14.019832Z
This round produced two complementary, rigorous first-step bounds at the dyadic start A_0 and their immediate corollaries. Prover-01 gives a 2-adic “layer-cake” inequality bounding Σ_{i∈S} 2^{v_2(i)} ≤ C·n·(1+log_2(n/m)) (m = number of matched pairs), and uses toggle-locality + the dyadic identity to prove the small-scale fractional bound
Σ_{j: L_j<L} Decrease_j/B_j(A_0) ≤ (2/(nL))·Σ_{i∈S}2^{v_2(i)} ≤ C·(1+log(n/m))/L,
so equal-scale [L,2L) steps give O((log L)/L). Prover-02 supplies an extremal 2-adic sum lemma Σ_{i∈S}2^{v_2(i)} ≤ N·H_K and a geometric-window lemma: with weights a_j(L)=β^{| (d−1−j) − ℓ |}/2^{j+1} one has Σ_j a_j(L)·Decrease_j ≤ C_β·(L/n)·|S|, hence O(1) per equal-scale step. Together these plug the verifier’s missing Inequality 2 and give concrete scale-sensitive scarcity at A_0. Main limitation: all results are first-step (A=A_0) and must be extended (via signed per-index bounds or persistence of arithmetic regularity) to iterate phases.
