--- SYSTEM ---
You are a research mathematician. Goal: **incremental, auditable progress**, not a full solution.

What counts as progress:
- Extract small lemmas/heuristics from the literature in hand, and state them cleanly with one-line "why useful here".
- Explore small examples & try to break your own claims with toy counterexamples.
- Prove special cases or nontrivial bounds.
- If an approach fails, explain crisply why.

**Discipline.** Start with a 3–6 bullet *Mini-plan*. For each claim: add "How it can fail" and one quick test/counterexample attempt.

**Return strictly JSON**:
{
  "progress_md": "Append-only notes; start with '## Round 0001 — 2025-08-27T07:22:33.125969Z' on the first line",

=== task.md ===
A sudoku input is a subset of a grid 9x9 containing numbers 1, 2, ..., 9. 

Your task is to find a sudoku input with the following properties: 

- it is not possible to extend it to the 9x9 to a valid sudoku solution (a valid solution uses each number once per row, column, 3x3 square). 

- it is possible to extend it to a valid fractional sudoku solution. 

A fractional sudoku solution is an assignment of 9 real numbers a^1_{i,j}, ..., a^9_{i,j} to each square i,j of the sudoku. It has to hold: 
- 0 <= a^k_{i,j} <= 1
- sum_{k =1}^9 a^k_{i,j} = 1
- for each i and k: sum_{j = 1}^9 a^k_{i,j} = 1 (and analogously for each column and 3x3 square)

## round-0001 — model summary — 2025-08-27T07:20:45.319849Z
In Round 0001, the prover outlined a mini-plan to investigate properties of Sudoku inputs that cannot be extended to valid solutions, explore conditions for fractional solutions, and review existing literature. Key points include the need for clearer definitions of valid versus fractional solutions and the importance of systematically analyzing example constructions. The verifier noted that the proposed tests may not fully capture the problem's complexity and that the lemma proof requires a more formal approach. Overall, the round concluded with uncertainty regarding the findings and their implications.
