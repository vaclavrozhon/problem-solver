In Round 0001, the prover outlined a mini-plan to investigate properties of Sudoku inputs that cannot be extended to valid solutions, explore conditions for fractional solutions, and review existing literature. Key points include the need for clearer definitions of valid versus fractional solutions and the importance of systematically analyzing example constructions. The verifier noted that the proposed tests may not fully capture the problem's complexity and that the lemma proof requires a more formal approach. Overall, the round concluded with uncertainty regarding the findings and their implications.
