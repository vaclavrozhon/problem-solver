All comments below are new incremental ideas with self-contained checks.\n\nSet-up and a useful general observation\n- Fiber finiteness lemma. In any tiling A+T of Z\u00d7S^1 as in the task (with at least one interval of positive length), each fiber T_n := {\u03b8 \u2208 S^1 : (n,\u03b8)\u2208T} is finite. Reason: At fixed n, the S^1-cover is a disjoint union of translates of finitely many intervals of positive lengths L_i=b_i\u2212a_i. The total measure equals 1, so \u2211_i (#T_{n\u2212k_i})\u00b7L_i=1; hence all #T_{n\u2212k_i}<\u221e.\n- Period transport across fibers. If T has period (k,\u03b1), then for every n, T_{n+k} = T_n + \u03b1 (Minkowski sum in S^1). In particular, for fixed residue r mod k, the sequence (T_{r+jk})_j is obtained by rotating the finite set T_r by successive adds of \u03b1.\n- Caution (correcting a tempting misclaim): The above does NOT imply \u03b1 is rational. The previous reasoning \u201cfinite set invariant under irrational rotation forces emptiness\u201d would require T_r = T_r + \u03b1, but here only T_{r+k} = T_r + \u03b1; T_r itself need not be invariant. So \u03b1 may be irrational.\n\nA tractable class: singleton-per-row tilings\n- We focus on the special case |T_n|=1 for all n (call these singleton tilings). Then T is determined by a sequence (\u03b8_n) with \u03b8_n \u2208 S^1.\n- Local-to-global structure: Write K={k_1,\u2026,k_\u2113} and L_i=b_i\u2212a_i. At row n, the \u2113 intervals are [a_i+\u03b8_{n\u2212k_i}, b_i+\u03b8_{n\u2212k_i}], i=1..\u2113. A partition of S^1 into these intervals (up to measure-zero overlaps) occurs iff there exist constants c_1,\u2026,c_\u2113 with c_{j+1}\u2212c_j = L_{i_j} in some cyclic order (i_1,\u2026,i_\u2113) of the indices, and a \u201crow phase\u201d \u03c6_n, such that for each i=i_j one has\n  \u03b8_{n\u2212k_i} = c_j \u2212 a_i + \u03c6_n.\n  Consequences:\n  1) For every i, j: \u03b8_{n\u2212k_i}\u2212\u03b8_{n\u2212k_j} = (c_j\u2212a_j)\u2212(c_i\u2212a_i) is independent of n.\n  2) In particular, if 1\u2208K (i.e., some k_i=1) then \u03b1:=\u03b8_n\u2212\u03b8_{n\u22121} is constant, i.e. \u03b8_n = \u03b8_0 + n\u03b1 and T has period (1,\u03b1).\n  3) The constant \u03b1 is a Z-linear combination of the lengths L_i (mod 1), determined by the chosen cyclic order and the offsets a_i. Thus different admissible cyclic orders can lead to different \u03b1 for the same tile A.\n\nConcrete mechanism for two different \u03b1 via two cyclic orders\n- Specialize to K={0,1,2}, \u2113=3, so rows n use the three phases \u03b8_n, \u03b8_{n\u22121}, \u03b8_{n\u22122}.\n- Fix |T_n|=1 for all n. For a given cyclic order of the types (i_1,i_2,i_3), the local partition at each row forces linear congruences among a_i and L_i and yields \u03b1 = \u03b8_n\u2212\u03b8_{n\u22121} as an explicit combination of a_i and L_i. Writing L_i for i=1,2,3 and taking k_1=0, k_2=1, k_3=2, one finds:\n  \u2022 For order O1=(1,2,3) around the circle, consistency (global solvability) is equivalent to\n    a_1 \u2212 2 a_2 + a_3 \u2261 \u2212L_1 + L_2  (mod 1),\n    and then \u03b1_1 \u2261 (a_2 \u2212 a_1) \u2212 L_1  (mod 1).\n  \u2022 For order O2=(1,3,2), consistency is equivalent to\n    a_1 \u2212 2 a_2 + a_3 \u2261 \u2212L_1 \u2212 2L_3  (mod 1),\n    and then \u03b1_2 \u2261 (a_2 \u2212 a_1) + L_2 \u2212 1  (mod 1).\n- A compatibility trick: If we impose L_1=L_3=:s, then the two congruences coincide (both sides equal 1\u22123s). Thus, by choosing a_1,a_2 freely and setting a_3 to satisfy\n  a_1 \u2212 2 a_2 + a_3 \u2261 1 \u2212 3 s  (mod 1),\n  the same tile A admits singleton tilings in both cyclic orders O1 and O2. For this tile, the two periods are\n  \u03b1_1 \u2261 (a_2 \u2212 a_1) \u2212 s,   \u03b1_2 \u2261 (a_2 \u2212 a_1) + (1 \u2212 2 s)  (mod 1).\n  Writing \u03b4:=a_2\u2212a_1 (mod 1), we have \u03b1_1 \u2261 \u03b4 \u2212 s and \u03b1_2 \u2261 \u03b4 + (1 \u2212 2s) (mod 1).\n\nEnsuring incommensurability of \u03b1_1 and \u03b1_2\n- Choose s\u2208(0,1/2) and \u03b4\u2208(s,2s) so that both representatives in [0,1) satisfy \u03b1_1=\u03b4\u2212s\u2208(0,1) and \u03b1_2=\u03b4+(1\u22122s)\u2208(0,1) (the latter is equivalent to \u03b4<2s). Then \u03b1_1/\u03b1_2 is irrational for generic \u03b4. Indeed, for fixed s, the set of \u03b4 giving \u03b1_1/\u03b1_2\u2208Q is countable: solving (\u03b4\u2212s)/(\u03b4+1\u22122s)=p/q yields a single \u03b4 for each p/q. Hence we can pick \u03b4 outside this countable set.\n- Example with explicit numbers (numerics only to guide checking): Take s=\u221a2/10\u22480.141421, L_1=L_3=s, L_2=1\u22122s\u22480.717158. Pick \u03b4=0.241421 (which lies in (s,2s)). Then set a_1=0, a_2=\u03b4, and a_3 \u2261 1\u22123s+2\u03b4 (mod 1) \u2248 0.058578. This A supports both orders O1 and O2, giving \u03b1_1\u22480.100000 and \u03b1_2\u22480.958579. By the argument above, \u03b1_1/\u03b1_2 is irrational for generic \u03b4 (here \u03b4 is irrational), so we expect incommensurability; the exact rational obstruction would force \u03b4 to be a specific rational function of s and p/q, which it is not.\n\nIrreducibility of the constructed tilings (singleton case)\n- Claim: If K contains 0 and 1 and |T_n|=1 for all n, then the tiling T is irreducible. Reason: Suppose T=T_1\u2294T_2 yields a partition Z=X_1\u2294X_2 with A+T_i=X_i\u00d7S^1. If n\u2208X_1, then row n is covered by intervals coming from k=0 (index n) and k=1 (index n\u22121). Thus \u03b8_n,\u03b8_{n\u22121} must belong to T_1. Iterating forces all \u03b8_m into T_1, so T_2=\u2205. Thus no nontrivial splitting exists.\n- Therefore, both singleton tilings constructed from O1 and O2 are irreducible.\n\nNon-column property\n- Heuristic/likely sufficient condition: If the set of k-positions contains at least two distinct values and the lengths contain an irrational (e.g., take s irrational with L_1=L_3=s and L_2=1\u22122s), then A is not a column. Sketch: A column tiling A+T_col=X\u00d7S^1 with X finite forces, at each row n\u2208X, integer counts c_{i,n} satisfying \u2211_i c_{i,n}L_i=1. With L_i irrationally related to 1, this severely restricts the possible c_{i,n} (often forcing a unique pattern), and compatibility across rows (given that each translate contributes to several rows simultaneously) becomes impossible unless K has a single position. I will turn this into a fully rigorous lemma next round by formalizing the linear algebra and the \u201crow coupling\u201d constraint induced by K={0,1,2}. For concreteness in the example above, with s irrational, I claim A is not a column.\n\nWhy this matters here\n- The construction above gives a concrete, checkable candidate answering the main question in the affirmative: a non-column tile A that admits two different irreducible tilings T and T\u2032 with periods (1,\u03b1_1) and (1,\u03b1_2) such that \u03b1_1/\u03b1_2\u2209Q.\n- The argument isolates a minimal mechanism: two admissible cyclic orders yield two different \u03b1, and choosing lengths with a symmetry (L_1=L_3) synchronizes the order-compatibility congruences.\n\nWhat to verify explicitly (auditable checks)\n1) Fiber finiteness: At each n, check \u2211_i (#T_{n\u2212k_i})L_i=1 for singleton tilings (obvious here: the two/equivalently three intervals partition S^1). 2) For O1 and O2: compute the three interval endpoints at row n in terms of \u03b8_n and verify pairwise adjacencies:\n   - O1 yields [\u03b8_n+a_1, \u03b8_n+a_1+L_1], [\u03b8_{n\u22121}+a_2, \u03b8_{n\u22121}+a_2+L_2], [\u03b8_{n\u22122}+a_3, \u03b8_{n\u22122}+a_3+L_3], where with \u03b1_1 and the congruence a_1\u22122a_2+a_3\u22611\u22123s, one has\n     \u03b8_n+a_1+L_1 = \u03b8_{n\u22121}+a_2 = \u03b8_{n\u22122}+a_3+L_3 and \u03b8_{n\u22122}+a_3+L_3+L_2 = \u03b8_n+a_1+1.\n   - O2 similarly gives adjacencies in the order (1,3,2) using \u03b1_2.\n   These equalities are straightforward algebra using \u03b8_{n\u2212j} = \u03b8_n \u2212 j\u03b1 and the displayed formulas for \u03b1_1,\u03b1_2.\n3) Irreducibility: As above, closure under predecessors 0 and 1 forces trivial splitting.\n4) Incommensurability: For fixed irrational s and \u03b4\u2208(s,2s), \u03b1_1/\u03b1_2 is irrational for all but countably many \u03b4, so choose \u03b4 irrational (e.g., \u03b4=s+\u221a2/100) to ensure \u03b1_1/\u03b1_2\u2209Q.\n5) Non-column: To be completed rigorously; the intended proof will show for K={0,1,2} and s irrational that no finite X can satisfy the per-row linear constraints compatibly with the multirow effect of each translate.\n\nObstacles and corrections\n- Earlier (false) idea fixed: \u201c\u03b1 must be rational\u201d was based on misreading T_{r+k}=T_r+\u03b1 as T_r=T_r+\u03b1. The corrected view allows \u03b1 irrational, fitting the problem\u2019s aim.\n- The non-column proof needs to be written cleanly; I have a clear route (row-coupled integer equations with an irrational parameter) and will supply details next.\n\nNext steps\n- Write the formal proof that the concrete A with K={0,1,2}, L_1=L_3=s irrational, L_2=1\u22122s, and a_1,a_2,a_3 satisfying a_1\u22122a_2+a_3\u22611\u22123s, is not a column.\n- Generalize the \u201ctwo-order mechanism\u201d beyond K={0,1,2}: characterize when multiple cyclic orders are simultaneously admissible and list the resulting \u03b1 as Z-linear forms in L_i.\n- Explore whether more than two incommensurable periods can be realized by the same tile (e.g., three different orders), and whether singleton assumption can be relaxed while keeping irreducibility.\n"
