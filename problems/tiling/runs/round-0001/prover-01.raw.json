All comments below are new incremental ideas with self-contained checks.\\n\\nSet-up and a useful general observation\\n- Fiber finiteness lemma. In any tiling A+T of Z×S^1 as in the task (with at least one interval of positive length), each fiber T_n := {θ ∈ S^1 : (n,θ)∈T} is finite. Reason: At fixed n, the S^1-cover is a disjoint union of translates of finitely many intervals of positive lengths L_i=b_i−a_i. The total measure equals 1, so ∑_i (#T_{n−k_i})·L_i=1; hence all #T_{n−k_i}<∞.\\n- Period transport across fibers. If T has period (k,α), then for every n, T_{n+k} = T_n + α (Minkowski sum in S^1). In particular, for fixed residue r mod k, the sequence (T_{r+jk})_j is obtained by rotating the finite set T_r by successive adds of α.\\n- Caution (correcting a tempting misclaim): The above does NOT imply α is rational. The previous reasoning “finite set invariant under irrational rotation forces emptiness” would require T_r = T_r + α, but here only T_{r+k} = T_r + α; T_r itself need not be invariant. So α may be irrational.\\n\\nA tractable class: singleton-per-row tilings\\n- We focus on the special case |T_n|=1 for all n (call these singleton tilings). Then T is determined by a sequence (θ_n) with θ_n ∈ S^1.\\n- Local-to-global structure: Write K={k_1,…,k_ℓ} and L_i=b_i−a_i. At row n, the ℓ intervals are [a_i+θ_{n−k_i}, b_i+θ_{n−k_i}], i=1..ℓ. A partition of S^1 into these intervals (up to measure-zero overlaps) occurs iff there exist constants c_1,…,c_ℓ with c_{j+1}−c_j = L_{i_j} in some cyclic order (i_1,…,i_ℓ) of the indices, and a “row phase” φ_n, such that for each i=i_j one has\\n  θ_{n−k_i} = c_j − a_i + φ_n.\\n  Consequences:\\n  1) For every i, j: θ_{n−k_i}−θ_{n−k_j} = (c_j−a_j)−(c_i−a_i) is independent of n.\\n  2) In particular, if 1∈K (i.e., some k_i=1) then α:=θ_n−θ_{n−1} is constant, i.e. θ_n = θ_0 + nα and T has period (1,α).\\n  3) The constant α is a Z-linear combination of the lengths L_i (mod 1), determined by the chosen cyclic order and the offsets a_i. Thus different admissible cyclic orders can lead to different α for the same tile A.\\n\\nConcrete mechanism for two different α via two cyclic orders\\n- Specialize to K={0,1,2}, ℓ=3, so rows n use the three phases θ_n, θ_{n−1}, θ_{n−2}.\\n- Fix |T_n|=1 for all n. For a given cyclic order of the types (i_1,i_2,i_3), the local partition at each row forces linear congruences among a_i and L_i and yields α = θ_n−θ_{n−1} as an explicit combination of a_i and L_i. Writing L_i for i=1,2,3 and taking k_1=0, k_2=1, k_3=2, one finds:\\n  • For order O1=(1,2,3) around the circle, consistency (global solvability) is equivalent to\\n    a_1 − 2 a_2 + a_3 ≡ −L_1 + L_2  (mod 1),\\n    and then α_1 ≡ (a_2 − a_1) − L_1  (mod 1).\\n  • For order O2=(1,3,2), consistency is equivalent to\\n    a_1 − 2 a_2 + a_3 ≡ −L_1 − 2L_3  (mod 1),\\n    and then α_2 ≡ (a_2 − a_1) + L_2 − 1  (mod 1).\\n- A compatibility trick: If we impose L_1=L_3=:s, then the two congruences coincide (both sides equal 1−3s). Thus, by choosing a_1,a_2 freely and setting a_3 to satisfy\\n  a_1 − 2 a_2 + a_3 ≡ 1 − 3 s  (mod 1),\\n  the same tile A admits singleton tilings in both cyclic orders O1 and O2. For this tile, the two periods are\\n  α_1 ≡ (a_2 − a_1) − s,   α_2 ≡ (a_2 − a_1) + (1 − 2 s)  (mod 1).\\n  Writing δ:=a_2−a_1 (mod 1), we have α_1 ≡ δ − s and α_2 ≡ δ + (1 − 2s) (mod 1).\\n\\nEnsuring incommensurability of α_1 and α_2\\n- Choose s∈(0,1/2) and δ∈(s,2s) so that both representatives in [0,1) satisfy α_1=δ−s∈(0,1) and α_2=δ+(1−2s)∈(0,1) (the latter is equivalent to δ<2s). Then α_1/α_2 is irrational for generic δ. Indeed, for fixed s, the set of δ giving α_1/α_2∈Q is countable: solving (δ−s)/(δ+1−2s)=p/q yields a single δ for each p/q. Hence we can pick δ outside this countable set.\\n- Example with explicit numbers (numerics only to guide checking): Take s=√2/10≈0.141421, L_1=L_3=s, L_2=1−2s≈0.717158. Pick δ=0.241421 (which lies in (s,2s)). Then set a_1=0, a_2=δ, and a_3 ≡ 1−3s+2δ (mod 1) ≈ 0.058578. This A supports both orders O1 and O2, giving α_1≈0.100000 and α_2≈0.958579. By the argument above, α_1/α_2 is irrational for generic δ (here δ is irrational), so we expect incommensurability; the exact rational obstruction would force δ to be a specific rational function of s and p/q, which it is not.\\n\\nIrreducibility of the constructed tilings (singleton case)\\n- Claim: If K contains 0 and 1 and |T_n|=1 for all n, then the tiling T is irreducible. Reason: Suppose T=T_1⊔T_2 yields a partition Z=X_1⊔X_2 with A+T_i=X_i×S^1. If n∈X_1, then row n is covered by intervals coming from k=0 (index n) and k=1 (index n−1). Thus θ_n,θ_{n−1} must belong to T_1. Iterating forces all θ_m into T_1, so T_2=∅. Thus no nontrivial splitting exists.\\n- Therefore, both singleton tilings constructed from O1 and O2 are irreducible.\\n\\nNon-column property\\n- Heuristic/likely sufficient condition: If the set of k-positions contains at least two distinct values and the lengths contain an irrational (e.g., take s irrational with L_1=L_3=s and L_2=1−2s), then A is not a column. Sketch: A column tiling A+T_col=X×S^1 with X finite forces, at each row n∈X, integer counts c_{i,n} satisfying ∑_i c_{i,n}L_i=1. With L_i irrationally related to 1, this severely restricts the possible c_{i,n} (often forcing a unique pattern), and compatibility across rows (given that each translate contributes to several rows simultaneously) becomes impossible unless K has a single position. I will turn this into a fully rigorous lemma next round by formalizing the linear algebra and the “row coupling” constraint induced by K={0,1,2}. For concreteness in the example above, with s irrational, I claim A is not a column.\\n\\nWhy this matters here\\n- The construction above gives a concrete, checkable candidate answering the main question in the affirmative: a non-column tile A that admits two different irreducible tilings T and T′ with periods (1,α_1) and (1,α_2) such that α_1/α_2∉Q.\\n- The argument isolates a minimal mechanism: two admissible cyclic orders yield two different α, and choosing lengths with a symmetry (L_1=L_3) synchronizes the order-compatibility congruences.\\n\\nWhat to verify explicitly (auditable checks)\\n1) Fiber finiteness: At each n, check ∑_i (#T_{n−k_i})L_i=1 for singleton tilings (obvious here: the two/equivalently three intervals partition S^1). 2) For O1 and O2: compute the three interval endpoints at row n in terms of θ_n and verify pairwise adjacencies:\\n   - O1 yields [θ_n+a_1, θ_n+a_1+L_1], [θ_{n−1}+a_2, θ_{n−1}+a_2+L_2], [θ_{n−2}+a_3, θ_{n−2}+a_3+L_3], where with α_1 and the congruence a_1−2a_2+a_3≡1−3s, one has\\n     θ_n+a_1+L_1 = θ_{n−1}+a_2 = θ_{n−2}+a_3+L_3 and θ_{n−2}+a_3+L_3+L_2 = θ_n+a_1+1.\\n   - O2 similarly gives adjacencies in the order (1,3,2) using α_2.\\n   These equalities are straightforward algebra using θ_{n−j} = θ_n − jα and the displayed formulas for α_1,α_2.\\n3) Irreducibility: As above, closure under predecessors 0 and 1 forces trivial splitting.\\n4) Incommensurability: For fixed irrational s and δ∈(s,2s), α_1/α_2 is irrational for all but countably many δ, so choose δ irrational (e.g., δ=s+√2/100) to ensure α_1/α_2∉Q.\\n5) Non-column: To be completed rigorously; the intended proof will show for K={0,1,2} and s irrational that no finite X can satisfy the per-row linear constraints compatibly with the multirow effect of each translate.\\n\\nObstacles and corrections\\n- Earlier (false) idea fixed: “α must be rational” was based on misreading T_{r+k}=T_r+α as T_r=T_r+α. The corrected view allows α irrational, fitting the problem’s aim.\\n- The non-column proof needs to be written cleanly; I have a clear route (row-coupled integer equations with an irrational parameter) and will supply details next.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Write the formal proof that the concrete A with K={0,1,2}, L_1=L_3=s irrational, L_2=1−2s, and a_1,a_2,a_3 satisfying a_1−2a_2+a_3≡1−3s, is not a column.\\n- Generalize the “two-order mechanism” beyond K={0,1,2}: characterize when multiple cyclic orders are simultaneously admissible and list the resulting α as Z-linear forms in L_i.\\n- Explore whether more than two incommensurable periods can be realized by the same tile (e.g., three different orders), and whether singleton assumption can be relaxed while keeping irreducibility.\\n\"}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"auto","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"ProverOutput","schema_":{"properties":{"progress_md":{"description":"Append-only progress notes","title":"Progress Md","type":"string"}},"required":["progress_md"],"title":"ProverOutput","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":930,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":32494,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":29632},"total_tokens":33424},"user":null,"store":true}
