  "progress_md": "Status and plan\n- I could not read output.md (not provided), so I proceed with a self-contained candidate construction and a few clean lemmas with proofs that can be verified directly.\n- Goal here: give an explicit non-column tile A that admits two different irreducible tilings T, T\u2032 of Z\u00d7S^1 with periods (1,\u03b1) and (1,\u03b1\u2032) such that \u03b1/\u03b1\u2032\u2209Q. Each claim below is small and testable.\n\nIdea: two-layer tile enforcing a constant phase increment\n- Use only two vertical layers k=0 and k=1. A translate of A centered at integer z contributes sets on rows z and z+1. If, on every row n, the union of the contributions from z=n and z=n\u22121 exactly partitions S^1, we get a tiling. If that partition forces \u03b8_n\u2212\u03b8_{n\u22121} to be a prescribed increment, we obtain a \u201chelical\u201d period (1,\u03b1).\n- We design the layers so that two different increments \u03b1 and \u03b1+1/2 both work. Choosing \u03b1 irrational ensures \u03b1/(\u03b1+1/2) is irrational.\n\nExplicit construction\n- Pick a finite union U\u2282S^1 of disjoint intervals with 0<|U|<1/2 (e.g., U=[0,0.2)\u222a[0.3,0.35)).\n- Define J_0 := U \u222a (U+1/2). Then J_0 is a finite union of intervals and has 1/2-periodicity: J_0+1/2 = J_0.\n- Fix \u03b1\u2208S^1\\Q (e.g., \u03b1=\u221a2/10 mod 1). Define J_1 := S^1 \\ (J_0+\u03b1). This is also a finite union of intervals.\n- Define the tile A := ({0}\u00d7J_0) \u222a ({1}\u00d7J_1).\n\nLemma 1 (Two periodic tilings exist)\nClaim. For the tile A above there exist tilings T_\u03b1 and T_{\u03b1+1/2} with periods (1,\u03b1) and (1,\u03b1+1/2), respectively.\nProof. For T_\u03b1, let T_\u03b1 := {(z, \u03b8_0+z\u03b1): z\u2208Z} for any \u03b8_0\u2208S^1. On row n, the two contributing translates are from z=n (layer 0) and z=n\u22121 (layer 1), giving sets (J_0+\u03b8_n) and (J_1+\u03b8_{n\u22121}), where \u03b8_n=\u03b8_0+n\u03b1. Since J_1=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1), we have J_1+\u03b8_{n\u22121}=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b8_{n\u22121}+\u03b1)=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b8_n). Thus these two sets are complementary (overlaps only at endpoints; measure zero), so every row is perfectly tiled. The set T_\u03b1 is invariant under (1,\u03b1), so T_\u03b1 has period (1,\u03b1).\nFor T_{\u03b1+1/2}, define T_{\u03b1+1/2} analogously with \u03b8'_n=\u03b8'_0+n(\u03b1+1/2). Using J_0+1/2=J_0, we get J_0+\u03b8'_n = J_0+(\u03b8'_{n\u22121}+\u03b1+1/2) = J_0+(\u03b8'_{n\u22121}+\u03b1). Hence J_1+\u03b8'_{n\u22121}=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b8'_n). So the same complement argument yields a tiling with period (1,\u03b1+1/2). \u220e\n\nLemma 2 (A is not a column)\nClaim. The tile A does not tile any finite set {n_1,\u2026,n_m}\u00d7S^1.\nProof. Any single translate of A contributes on exactly two adjacent rows. Suppose A+T_f={n_1,\u2026,n_m}\u00d7S^1 for finite T_f. Let n_max be the largest row in {n_1,\u2026,n_m}. In row n_max, coverage requires two contributions: one from layer 0 at z=n_max and one from layer 1 at z=n_max\u22121 (since neither J_0 nor J_1 alone has full measure). If z=n_max\u2208T_f, then that translate also covers row n_max+1 (outside the target), contradiction. If we try to avoid z=n_max by only using z=n_max\u22121, we still fail because J_1 alone has measure <1 and cannot cover the whole circle. Thus no finite T_f works. \u220e\n\nLemma 3 (Irreducibility)\nClaim. Every tiling of Z\u00d7S^1 by A of the form constructed in Lemma 1 is irreducible.\nProof. Suppose T splits as a disjoint union T_1\u2294T_2 with Z partitioned into X_1\u2294X_2 and A+T_i=X_i\u00d7S^1. If n\u2208X_1, then row n must be covered by contributions from z=n (layer 0) and z=n\u22121 (layer 1). Therefore (n,\u03b8_n) and (n\u22121,\u03b8_{n\u22121}) must both belong to T_1; otherwise A+T_1 would not cover row n. But then row n\u22121 uses (n\u22121,\u03b8_{n\u22121}) and (n\u22122,\u03b8_{n\u22122}), forcing (n\u22122,\u03b8_{n\u22122})\u2208T_1 as well. Inducting both directions shows T_1 contains all anchors, hence X_1=Z and T_2=\u2205, i.e., the tiling is irreducible. \u220e\n\nLemma 4 (Incommensurability)\nClaim. If \u03b1\u2209Q, then \u03b1/(\u03b1+1/2)\u2209Q.\nProof. If \u03b1/(\u03b1+1/2)=p/q\u2208Q, then \u03b1 = (p/q)(\u03b1+1/2), so \u03b1(1\u2212p/q)=p/(2q), hence \u03b1 = p/(2(q\u2212p))\u2208Q, contradiction. \u220e\n\nWhy this solves the posed existence question\n- The tile A is not a column (Lemma 2).\n- There are two different irreducible tilings T_\u03b1 and T_{\u03b1+1/2} (Lemma 1, Lemma 3), with periods (1,\u03b1) and (1,\u03b1+1/2). Picking \u03b1 irrational ensures the periods are incommensurable by Lemma 4.\n- Everything is explicit and verifiable. One concrete choice is: U=[0,0.2)\u222a[0.3,0.35), \u03b1=\u221a2/10 mod 1. Then J_0=U\u222a(U+1/2), J_1=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1), and A=({0}\u00d7J_0)\u222a({1}\u00d7J_1).\n\nFourier/quotient check (optional sanity)\n- For k=1, the quotient G/\u27e8(1,\u03b1)\u27e9\u2245S^1. In the quotient, A projects to J_0 \u2294 (J_1\u2212\u03b1). Our choice J_1=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1) is exactly the quotient tiling identity. The \u03b1\u2192\u03b1+1/2 case follows since J_0 is 1/2-periodic.\n\nObstacles and caveats\n- Endpoints produce at most measure-zero overlaps, allowed by the tiling definition. Choosing U with generic endpoints avoids any accidental positive-measure overlaps.\n\nNext steps for the verifier\n- Check the three lemmas directly for the explicit numeric example given above.\n- Optionally generalize: taking J_0 to be 1/q-periodic yields q distinct tilings with periods (1,\u03b1+j/q), j=0,\u2026,q\u22121. For any irrational \u03b1 and any j\u22600, \u03b1/(\u03b1+j/q) is irrational by the same algebra, giving many incommensurable options.\n\nGaps in output.md\n- Not applicable; output.md was not provided in this round. If earlier outputs assert nonexistence or require stronger irreducibility notions, we should align definitions. The above argument relies only on the stated tiling, column, and irreducibility definitions in task.md."
