  "progress_md": "Status and files\n- I do not see an output.md in this round; hence I cannot check or critique any curated results. I proceed to extract structure, prove small lemmas, and propose a concrete candidate construction to test.\n\nSet-up: fiberization across the Z-coordinate\n- Write T \u2286 Z \u00d7 S^1 as fibers T_n := {\u03b8 \u2208 S^1 : (n,\u03b8) \u2208 T}.\n- For each m \u2208 Z, the a.e. disjoint covering condition is\n  \u2211_{i=1}^\u2113 \u2211_{\u03c6\u2208T_{m-k_i}} 1_{[a_i,b_i]}(\u00b7\u2212\u03c6) = 1  a.e. on S^1.\n  Equivalently, for each m the circle S^1 is a.e. partitioned by the intervals [a_i,b_i] translated by all \u03c6\u2208T_{m-k_i}.\n\nBasic necessary conditions\n- Finite fibers: For each n, T_n must be finite. Reason: in column m, the pieces are disjoint a.e.; the total measure equals \u2211_i |I_i|\u00b7|T_{m-k_i}| = 1; since |I_i|>0, |T_{m-k_i}| are bounded, hence finite.\n- Reducibility obstruction (gcd): Let K={k_1,\u2026,k_\u2113} and H:=\u27e8K\u2212K\u27e9\u2264Z. If H\u2260Z (i.e., gcd{k_i\u2212k_j}>1), then any tiling splits along residue classes mod H, hence is reducible by grouping classes. Thus any irreducible tiling requires gcd{k_i\u2212k_j}=1.\n\nIrreducibility lemma for \u201cone translate per fiber\u201d\n- Ansatz: suppose |T_n|=1 for all n, say T_n={\u03b8_n}. Then the covering of column m uses exactly one translate of [a_i,b_i] coming from \u03b8_{m\u2212k_i} for each i.\n- Claim: If gcd{k_i\u2212k_j}=1 then any such tiling is irreducible. Proof: Suppose Z=X_1\u2294X_2 and T=T_1\u2294T_2 produce A+T_i=X_i\u00d7S^1. If m\u2208X_1, then to cover S^1 at column m using only T_1 we must have m\u2212k_i\u2208X_1 for all i (since each of the \u2113 necessary pieces comes from a distinct index m\u2212k_i). Hence X_1 is closed under subtraction by each k_i. Now take any i,j. If m\u2208X_1 then m\u2212k_i\u2208X_1; if m+(k_j\u2212k_i)\u2209X_1 (i.e. in X_2), column m+(k_j\u2212k_i) to be covered by T_2 would require (m+(k_j\u2212k_i))\u2212k_j = m\u2212k_i \u2208 X_2, contradicting m\u2212k_i\u2208X_1. Thus X_1 is closed under addition by all differences k_j\u2212k_i, so X_1 is a union of cosets of H=\u27e8K\u2212K\u27e9=Z, hence X_1 is either \u2205 or Z. So the tiling is irreducible.\n\nOne-translate-per-fiber reduces to linear congruences\n- Suppose |T_n|=1 and write \u03b8_n=u+n\u03b2 (period (1,\u03b2)). Assume at each column the \u2113 intervals appear in a fixed cyclic order \u03c3 on {1,\u2026,\u2113}. The adjacency condition along the circle is, for each i,\n  \u03b8_{m\u2212k_{\u03c3(i)}} + a_{\u03c3(i)} \u2261 \u03b8_{m\u2212k_i} + a_i + c_i (mod 1),\n  with c_i = b_i\u2212a_i. Eliminating m gives the family of congruences\n  (k_i\u2212k_{\u03c3(i)}) \u03b2 \u2261 a_i + c_i \u2212 a_{\u03c3(i)} (mod 1),  i=1,\u2026,\u2113.\n  Summing these yields an identity (since \u2211 c_i=1\u22610 in S^1), so there are \u2113\u22121 independent constraints.\n\nTwo tilings from one tile when \u2113=3 and K={0,1,2}\n- Take \u2113=3 with offsets (k_1,k_2,k_3)=(0,1,2); lengths c_1,c_2,c_3>0, c_1+c_2+c_3=1.\n- Consider two cyclic orders: \u03c3=(1\u21922\u21923\u21921) and \u03c3'=(1\u21923\u21922\u21921) (reverse).\n- Solving the congruences shows a compatibility criterion and a relation between the two period slopes:\n  \u2022 The two orders are simultaneously compatible for the same endpoints a_i iff c_1=c_3.\n  \u2022 When c_1=c_3, if the first tiling has slope \u03b2 (so T has period (1,\u03b1) with \u03b1=\u03b2), then the reversed-order tiling exists for the same tile A with slope \u03b2' \u2261 \u03b2 \u2212 c_1 (mod 1) (hence period (1,\u03b1') with \u03b1'=\u03b2').\n  Sketch: Write the \u03c3-congruences as \u2212\u03b2 \u2261 a_1+c_1\u2212a_2, \u2212\u03b2 \u2261 a_2+c_2\u2212a_3, 2\u03b2 \u2261 a_3+c_3\u2212a_1. From these define a_2,a_3 in terms of a_1,\u03b2,c\u2019s. The \u03c3'-congruences become \u22122\u03b2' \u2261 a_1+c_1\u2212a_3, \u03b2' \u2261 a_2+c_2\u2212a_1, \u03b2' \u2261 a_3+c_3\u2212a_2. Substituting a_2,a_3 from \u03c3, the three congruences are consistent iff c_1=c_3, and then force \u03b2' \u2261 \u03b2 \u2212 c_1 (mod 1).\n\nNon-column property\n- Claim: The above A (with one interval in each of the three columns 0,1,2, with lengths c_1,c_2,c_3 and c_1=c_3\u2260c_2) is not a column. Reason: If A tiled {n_1,n_2,n_3}\u00d7S^1 by a set \u0398\u2282S^1 of vertical shifts only, then in particular the column with length c_2 would be tiled by |\u0398| disjoint copies of an interval of length c_2, forcing |\u0398|\u00b7c_2=1. The columns with length c_1 satisfy |\u0398|\u00b7c_1=1 as well. These equalities imply c_1=c_2, contrary to c_2=1\u22122c_1 (unless c_1=c_2=1/3, which we avoid by choosing c_1\u22601/3). More generally, a single finite \u0398 cannot tile S^1 simultaneously by disjoint copies of two different lengths with total measure 1 in each column.\n\nIncommensurable periods via a concrete choice\n- Choose c_1=c_3=2/5, c_2=1\u22122c_1=1/5. Pick any irrational \u03b2\u2208(0,1) (e.g., \u03b2=\u221a2/4). Set a_1 arbitrarily (say 0), and define\n  a_2 \u2261 a_1 + c_1 \u2212 (k_1\u2212k_2)\u03b2 = c_1 + \u03b2,\n  a_3 \u2261 a_2 + c_2 \u2212 (k_2\u2212k_3)\u03b2 = c_1 + c_2 + 2\u03b2,\n  all modulo 1. This fixes the tile A.\n- Then:\n  \u2022 T = {(n, u+n\u03b2): n\u2208Z} is an irreducible tiling with period (1,\u03b1) where \u03b1=\u03b2, using cyclic order 1\u21922\u21923\u21921.\n  \u2022 T' = {(n, u'+n\u03b2'): n\u2208Z} with \u03b2'\u2261\u03b2\u2212c_1 (mod 1) is an irreducible tiling with period (1,\u03b1') where \u03b1'=\u03b2', using cyclic order 1\u21923\u21922\u21921.\n- Incommensurability: Since c_1=2/5 is rational and \u03b2 is irrational, the ratio \u03b1/\u03b1' is irrational. Indeed, if \u03b1/\u03b1'\u2208Q, then \u03b1 = r \u03b1' for some rational r; but \u03b1'\u2261\u03b1\u2212c_1 (or \u03b1'\u2261\u03b1+1\u2212c_1 depending on the representative in [0,1)), yielding \u03b1 = r(\u03b1\u00b1(1\u2212c_1)), so \u03b1 is rational\u2014contradiction. A short algebraic check: \u03b1/(\u03b1\u2212c_1)=p/q \u21d2 \u03b1 = (p c_1)/(q\u2212p) \u2208 Q.\n\nWorked numeric instance (sanity check)\n- Take \u03b2=\u221a2/4\u22480.353553, c_1=c_3=0.4, c_2=0.2, a_1=0.\n  Then a_2\u22480.753553, a_3\u22480.307106. Forward tiling at column m=0 uses the three arcs [0,0.4], [0.4,0.6], [0.6,1] (disjoint cover). The reversed tiling uses \u03b2'\u2261\u03b2\u22120.4\u22610.953553; at m=0 the arcs are [0,0.4], [0.4,0.8], [0.8,1] (disjoint cover). Both tilings are irreducible by the lemma. The ratio \u03b1/\u03b1'\u22480.37\u2026 is irrational by the argument above.\n\nWhy useful here\n- This furnishes a concrete family of tiles A (not columns) with two different irreducible periodic tilings whose vertical periods are incommensurable. It suggests a positive resolution to the existence question.\n\nOpen checks and potential gaps to verify rigorously\n- Endpoints are measured-zero; ensure no overlaps except at endpoints\u2014true by construction since adjacencies are exact.\n- The non-column argument: formalize that a common finite \u0398 cannot simultaneously partition the circle with two different interval lengths summing to 1. The counting |\u0398|\u00b7c=1 for each column is immediate from disjointness; equality for two different c\u2019s forces equality of lengths. This can be stated and proved succinctly.\n- Irreducibility lemma is proved for the 1-per-fiber case; this covers our construction. A verifier may want to write it as a formal implication: m\u2208X_1 \u21d2 m\u2212k_i\u2208X_1 for all i; then show closure under additions of differences using the complement X_2 and the covering requirement.\n\nIdeas for generalization and next steps\n- Formalize and record in output.md: (1) gcd-necessity lemma; (2) one-translate-per-fiber congruence system; (3) irreducibility lemma for one-translate-per-fiber; (4) the \u2113=3, K={0,1,2}, c_1=c_3 construction giving two tilings with \u03b2'\u2261\u03b2\u2212c_1; (5) non-column criterion.\n- Explore whether other pairs of permutations \u03c3,\u03c3' give different linear relations among \u03b2,\u03b2' for broader families (possibly yielding richer parameter sets or more than two tilings).\n- Fourier viewpoint: For completeness, note that for general tilings (not necessarily |T_n|=1), the nonzero Fourier modes satisfy linear recurrences whose characteristic equation involves the coefficients sin(\u03c0 t c_i)/(\u03c0 t) and can constrain possible periods. Recording this could help classify when multiple periodic tilings exist.\n"
