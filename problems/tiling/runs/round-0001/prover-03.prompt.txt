You are a research mathematician. 

You are being run in a loop with a verifier that checks rigor. Your goal is to make **incremental, auditable progress**. You are not expected to solve the problem at once, but to generate new, testable ideas.

Inputs: 
- task statement 
- notes.md (summary of past progress; optional) 
- output.md (rigorously proven results curated so far; optional) 
- summary of past rounds (optional) 
- possibly some reference papers.

What counts as progress:
- Extract small lemmas/heuristics from literature and state them cleanly with one-line "why useful here".
- Explore small examples & try to break your own claims with toy counterexamples.
- Prove special cases or nontrivial bounds.
- If an approach fails, explain crisply why.
- Point out flaws in notes.md or output.md (but do not rewrite output.md yourself).

**Discipline.** 
- Read notes, outputs, summaries carefully before proposing new work. 
- Reference papers if relevant, but focus on *incremental, checkable steps*. 
- Do not output Markdown code fences, only raw JSON. 
- Length: at least ~200 words. 
- Organize your reasoning with short headings (Ideas, Examples, Obstacles, Next steps), make clear what your claims are and how they are supported. 
- Remember: the verifier curates notes and outputs, you only suggest.

**Return strictly JSON**:
{
  "progress_md": "Your progress notes for this round in Markdown (KaTeX allowed). Point out any gaps in output.md clearly. Do not modify output.md directly."
}

Work on this problem context:

=== task.md ===

We study **translational tilings** with a single tile in the group $\mathbb{Z}\times S^1$, where $\mathbb{Z}$ denotes the integers and $S^1$ the unit circle with addition modulo 1.

A **tile** is a set of the form

$$
A = \bigcup_{i=1}^\ell \{k_i\}\times [a_i,b_i],
$$

where the indices $k_i \in \mathbb{Z}$ may repeat, and each $[a_i,b_i]\subseteq S^1$ is an interval.

A **tiling** is a set $T\subseteq \mathbb{Z}\times S^1$ such that

$$
A+T = \mathbb{Z}\times S^1
\quad\text{and}\quad 
(A+t)\cap (A+t')
$$

has measure zero whenever $t\neq t'$.

We say that a tile $A$ is a **column** if it tiles a set of the form $\{n_1,\dots,n_m\}\times S^1$.

We call a tiling $T$ **irreducible** if it cannot be written as a disjoint union $T=T_1\sqcup T_2$ of two nonempty sets such that there exists a partition $\mathbb{Z}=X_1\sqcup X_2$ with

$$
A+T_i = X_i\times S^1
\quad\text{for } i=1,2.
$$

The problem is to decide whether there exists a tile $A$ which is **not a column**, and which admits two different **irreducible** tilings $T$ and $T'$ of $\mathbb{Z}\times S^1$, such that:

* $T$ has period $(k,\alpha)$ and $T'$ has period $(k',\alpha')$ with $k,k'>0$,
* the periods are *incommensurable*, i.e. $\alpha/\alpha'\notin \mathbb{Q}$.

Return ONLY valid JSON with a single field:
{ "progress_md": "<your progress notes for this round>" }

Read output.md. If you spot gaps, errors, or missing justifications in output.md, point them out clearly inside progress_md.
