{"progress_md":"Status and files\n- I do not see an output.md in this round; hence I cannot check or critique any curated results. I proceed to extract structure, prove small lemmas, and propose a concrete candidate construction to test.\n\nSet-up: fiberization across the Z-coordinate\n- Write T ⊆ Z × S^1 as fibers T_n := {θ ∈ S^1 : (n,θ) ∈ T}.\n- For each m ∈ Z, the a.e. disjoint covering condition is\n  ∑_{i=1}^ℓ ∑_{φ∈T_{m-k_i}} 1_{[a_i,b_i]}(·−φ) = 1  a.e. on S^1.\n  Equivalently, for each m the circle S^1 is a.e. partitioned by the intervals [a_i,b_i] translated by all φ∈T_{m-k_i}.\n\nBasic necessary conditions\n- Finite fibers: For each n, T_n must be finite. Reason: in column m, the pieces are disjoint a.e.; the total measure equals ∑_i |I_i|·|T_{m-k_i}| = 1; since |I_i|>0, |T_{m-k_i}| are bounded, hence finite.\n- Reducibility obstruction (gcd): Let K={k_1,…,k_ℓ} and H:=⟨K−K⟩≤Z. If H≠Z (i.e., gcd{k_i−k_j}>1), then any tiling splits along residue classes mod H, hence is reducible by grouping classes. Thus any irreducible tiling requires gcd{k_i−k_j}=1.\n\nIrreducibility lemma for “one translate per fiber”\n- Ansatz: suppose |T_n|=1 for all n, say T_n={θ_n}. Then the covering of column m uses exactly one translate of [a_i,b_i] coming from θ_{m−k_i} for each i.\n- Claim: If gcd{k_i−k_j}=1 then any such tiling is irreducible. Proof: Suppose Z=X_1⊔X_2 and T=T_1⊔T_2 produce A+T_i=X_i×S^1. If m∈X_1, then to cover S^1 at column m using only T_1 we must have m−k_i∈X_1 for all i (since each of the ℓ necessary pieces comes from a distinct index m−k_i). Hence X_1 is closed under subtraction by each k_i. Now take any i,j. If m∈X_1 then m−k_i∈X_1; if m+(k_j−k_i)∉X_1 (i.e. in X_2), column m+(k_j−k_i) to be covered by T_2 would require (m+(k_j−k_i))−k_j = m−k_i ∈ X_2, contradicting m−k_i∈X_1. Thus X_1 is closed under addition by all differences k_j−k_i, so X_1 is a union of cosets of H=⟨K−K⟩=Z, hence X_1 is either ∅ or Z. So the tiling is irreducible.\n\nOne-translate-per-fiber reduces to linear congruences\n- Suppose |T_n|=1 and write θ_n=u+nβ (period (1,β)). Assume at each column the ℓ intervals appear in a fixed cyclic order σ on {1,…,ℓ}. The adjacency condition along the circle is, for each i,\n  θ_{m−k_{σ(i)}} + a_{σ(i)} ≡ θ_{m−k_i} + a_i + c_i (mod 1),\n  with c_i = b_i−a_i. Eliminating m gives the family of congruences\n  (k_i−k_{σ(i)}) β ≡ a_i + c_i − a_{σ(i)} (mod 1),  i=1,…,ℓ.\n  Summing these yields an identity (since ∑ c_i=1≡0 in S^1), so there are ℓ−1 independent constraints.\n\nTwo tilings from one tile when ℓ=3 and K={0,1,2}\n- Take ℓ=3 with offsets (k_1,k_2,k_3)=(0,1,2); lengths c_1,c_2,c_3>0, c_1+c_2+c_3=1.\n- Consider two cyclic orders: σ=(1→2→3→1) and σ'=(1→3→2→1) (reverse).\n- Solving the congruences shows a compatibility criterion and a relation between the two period slopes:\n  • The two orders are simultaneously compatible for the same endpoints a_i iff c_1=c_3.\n  • When c_1=c_3, if the first tiling has slope β (so T has period (1,α) with α=β), then the reversed-order tiling exists for the same tile A with slope β' ≡ β − c_1 (mod 1) (hence period (1,α') with α'=β').\n  Sketch: Write the σ-congruences as −β ≡ a_1+c_1−a_2, −β ≡ a_2+c_2−a_3, 2β ≡ a_3+c_3−a_1. From these define a_2,a_3 in terms of a_1,β,c’s. The σ'-congruences become −2β' ≡ a_1+c_1−a_3, β' ≡ a_2+c_2−a_1, β' ≡ a_3+c_3−a_2. Substituting a_2,a_3 from σ, the three congruences are consistent iff c_1=c_3, and then force β' ≡ β − c_1 (mod 1).\n\nNon-column property\n- Claim: The above A (with one interval in each of the three columns 0,1,2, with lengths c_1,c_2,c_3 and c_1=c_3≠c_2) is not a column. Reason: If A tiled {n_1,n_2,n_3}×S^1 by a set Θ⊂S^1 of vertical shifts only, then in particular the column with length c_2 would be tiled by |Θ| disjoint copies of an interval of length c_2, forcing |Θ|·c_2=1. The columns with length c_1 satisfy |Θ|·c_1=1 as well. These equalities imply c_1=c_2, contrary to c_2=1−2c_1 (unless c_1=c_2=1/3, which we avoid by choosing c_1≠1/3). More generally, a single finite Θ cannot tile S^1 simultaneously by disjoint copies of two different lengths with total measure 1 in each column.\n\nIncommensurable periods via a concrete choice\n- Choose c_1=c_3=2/5, c_2=1−2c_1=1/5. Pick any irrational β∈(0,1) (e.g., β=√2/4). Set a_1 arbitrarily (say 0), and define\n  a_2 ≡ a_1 + c_1 − (k_1−k_2)β = c_1 + β,\n  a_3 ≡ a_2 + c_2 − (k_2−k_3)β = c_1 + c_2 + 2β,\n  all modulo 1. This fixes the tile A.\n- Then:\n  • T = {(n, u+nβ): n∈Z} is an irreducible tiling with period (1,α) where α=β, using cyclic order 1→2→3→1.\n  • T' = {(n, u'+nβ'): n∈Z} with β'≡β−c_1 (mod 1) is an irreducible tiling with period (1,α') where α'=β', using cyclic order 1→3→2→1.\n- Incommensurability: Since c_1=2/5 is rational and β is irrational, the ratio α/α' is irrational. Indeed, if α/α'∈Q, then α = r α' for some rational r; but α'≡α−c_1 (or α'≡α+1−c_1 depending on the representative in [0,1)), yielding α = r(α±(1−c_1)), so α is rational—contradiction. A short algebraic check: α/(α−c_1)=p/q ⇒ α = (p c_1)/(q−p) ∈ Q.\n\nWorked numeric instance (sanity check)\n- Take β=√2/4≈0.353553, c_1=c_3=0.4, c_2=0.2, a_1=0.\n  Then a_2≈0.753553, a_3≈0.307106. Forward tiling at column m=0 uses the three arcs [0,0.4], [0.4,0.6], [0.6,1] (disjoint cover). The reversed tiling uses β'≡β−0.4≡0.953553; at m=0 the arcs are [0,0.4], [0.4,0.8], [0.8,1] (disjoint cover). Both tilings are irreducible by the lemma. The ratio α/α'≈0.37… is irrational by the argument above.\n\nWhy useful here\n- This furnishes a concrete family of tiles A (not columns) with two different irreducible periodic tilings whose vertical periods are incommensurable. It suggests a positive resolution to the existence question.\n\nOpen checks and potential gaps to verify rigorously\n- Endpoints are measured-zero; ensure no overlaps except at endpoints—true by construction since adjacencies are exact.\n- The non-column argument: formalize that a common finite Θ cannot simultaneously partition the circle with two different interval lengths summing to 1. The counting |Θ|·c=1 for each column is immediate from disjointness; equality for two different c’s forces equality of lengths. This can be stated and proved succinctly.\n- Irreducibility lemma is proved for the 1-per-fiber case; this covers our construction. A verifier may want to write it as a formal implication: m∈X_1 ⇒ m−k_i∈X_1 for all i; then show closure under additions of differences using the complement X_2 and the covering requirement.\n\nIdeas for generalization and next steps\n- Formalize and record in output.md: (1) gcd-necessity lemma; (2) one-translate-per-fiber congruence system; (3) irreducibility lemma for one-translate-per-fiber; (4) the ℓ=3, K={0,1,2}, c_1=c_3 construction giving two tilings with β'≡β−c_1; (5) non-column criterion.\n- Explore whether other pairs of permutations σ,σ' give different linear relations among β,β' for broader families (possibly yielding richer parameter sets or more than two tilings).\n- Fourier viewpoint: For completeness, note that for general tilings (not necessarily |T_n|=1), the nonzero Fourier modes satisfy linear recurrences whose characteristic equation involves the coefficients sin(π t c_i)/(π t) and can constrain possible periods. Recording this could help classify when multiple periodic tilings exist.\n"}
