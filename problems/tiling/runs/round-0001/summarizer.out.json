  "summary_md": "This round produced multiple explicit constructions showing a non-column finite tile A \u2282 Z\u00d7S^1 can admit two distinct irreducible periodic tilings with incommensurable vertical shifts. Two mechanisms emerged: (a) a 3-layer singleton-per-row scheme (K={0,1,2}) where two different cyclic orders of the three intervals give two different slopes \u03b1, \u03b1' (synchronizing conditions achieved when L_1=L_3); (b) a 2-layer construction (K={0,1}) using a 1/2-periodic layer J_0 that yields tilings with slopes \u03b1 and \u03b1+1/2. Both approaches include proofs of irreducibility and arguments that the tile is not a column (the 3-layer non-column argument is sketched and planned to be formalized). Choosing irrational length parameters (or irrational shift \u03b1) gives \u03b1/\u03b1'\u2209Q. Verifier: success. Citations: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json, prover-03.out.json.",
  "highlights": [
    "Fiber finiteness: in any tiling each fiber T_n is finite (\u2211_i |T_{n\u2212k_i}|\u00b7L_i=1).",
    "GCD/irreducibility reduction: if \u27e8K\u2212K\u27e9\u2260Z a tiling splits by residue classes; for one-translate-per-row and gcd=1 any tiling is irreducible.",
    "Singleton-per-row \u2194 linear congruences: with |T_n|=1 the adjacency/order at each row yields linear congruences determining achievable period slopes.",
    "\u2113=3, K={0,1,2} mechanism: when L_1=L_3 one tile admits two cyclic orders producing \u03b11 and \u03b12 (explicit formulas: \u03b11\u2261\u03b4\u2212s, \u03b12\u2261\u03b4+1\u22122s mod 1), so picking s irrational and generic \u03b4 makes \u03b11/\u03b12 irrational.",
    "K={0,1} construction: pick J_0 with 1/2-periodicity, set J_1=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1); then T_{\u03b1} and T_{\u03b1+1/2} are both valid, irreducible tilings and the tile is not a column.",
    "Practical verification: numeric examples are provided in each prover output; the verifier returned success for the round."
