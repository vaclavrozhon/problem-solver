Set-up and a useful general observation
- Fiber finiteness lemma. In any tiling A+T of Z×S^1 as in the task (with at least one interval of positive length), each fiber T_n := {θ ∈ S^1 : (n,θ)∈T} is finite. Reason: At fixed n, the S^1-cover is a disjoint union of translates of finitely many intervals of positive lengths L_i=b_i−a_i. The total measure equals 1, so ∑_i (#T_{n−k_i})·L_i=1; hence all #T_{n−k_i}<∞.
- Period transport across fibers. If T has period (k,α), then for every n, T_{n+k} = T_n + α (Minkowski sum in S^1). In particular, for fixed residue r mod k, the sequence (T_{r+jk})_j is obtained by rotating the finite set T_r by successive adds of α.
- Caution (correcting a tempting misclaim): The above does NOT imply α is rational. The previous reasoning “finite set invariant under irrational rotation forces emptiness” would require T_r = T_r + α, but here only T_{r+k} = T_r + α; T_r itself need not be invariant. So α may be irrational.

A tractable class: singleton-per-row tilings
- We focus on the special case |T_n|=1 for all n (call these singleton tilings). Then T is determined by a sequence (θ_n) with θ_n ∈ S^1.
- Local-to-global structure: Write K={k_1,…,k_ℓ} and L_i=b_i−a_i. At row n, the ℓ intervals are [a_i+θ_{n−k_i}, b_i+θ_{n−k_i}], i=1..ℓ. A partition of S^1 into these intervals (up to measure-zero overlaps) occurs iff there exist constants c_1,…,c_ℓ with c_{j+1}−c_j = L_{i_j} in some cyclic order (i_1,…,i_ℓ) of the indices, and a “row phase” φ_n, such that for each i=i_j one has
  θ_{n−k_i} = c_j − a_i + φ_n.
  Consequences:
  1) For every i, j: θ_{n−k_i}−θ_{n−k_j} = (c_j−a_j)−(c_i−a_i) is independent of n.
  2) In particular, if 1∈K (i.e., some k_i=1) then α:=θ_n−θ_{n−1} is constant, i.e. θ_n = θ_0 + nα and T has period (1,α).
  3) The constant α is a Z-linear combination of the lengths L_i (mod 1), determined by the chosen cyclic order and the offsets a_i. Thus different admissible cyclic orders can lead to different α for the same tile A.

Concrete mechanism for two different α via two cyclic orders
- Specialize to K={0,1,2}, ℓ=3, so rows n use the three phases θ_n, θ_{n−1}, θ_{n−2}.
- Fix |T_n|=1 for all n. For a given cyclic order of the types (i_1,i_2,i_3), the local partition at each row forces linear congruences among a_i and L_i and yields α = θ_n−θ_{n−1} as an explicit combination of a_i and L_i. Writing L_i for i=1,2,3 and taking k_1=0, k_2=1, k_3=2, one finds:
  • For order O1=(1,2,3) around the circle, consistency (global solvability) is equivalent to
    a_1 − 2 a_2 + a_3 ≡ −L_1 + L_2  (mod 1),
    and then α_1 ≡ (a_2 − a_1) − L_1  (mod 1).
  • For order O2=(1,3,2), consistency is equivalent to
    a_1 − 2 a_2 + a_3 ≡ −L_1 − 2L_3  (mod 1),
    and then α_2 ≡ (a_2 − a_1) + L_2 − 1  (mod 1).
- A compatibility trick: If we impose L_1=L_3=:s, then the two congruences coincide (both sides equal 1−3s). Thus, by choosing a_1,a_2 freely and setting a_3 to satisfy
  a_1 − 2 a_2 + a_3 ≡ 1 − 3 s  (mod 1),
  the same tile A admits singleton tilings in both cyclic orders O1 and O2. For this tile, the two periods are
  α_1 ≡ (a_2 − a_1) − s,   α_2 ≡ (a_2 − a_1) + (1 − 2 s)  (mod 1).
  Writing δ:=a_2−a_1 (mod 1), we have α_1 ≡ δ − s and α_2 ≡ δ + (1 − 2s) (mod 1).

Ensuring incommensurability of α_1 and α_2
- Choose s∈(0,1/2) and δ∈(s,2s) so that both representatives in [0,1) satisfy α_1=δ−s∈(0,1) and α_2=δ+(1−2s)∈(0,1) (the latter is equivalent to δ<2s). Then α_1/α_2 is irrational for generic δ. Indeed, for fixed s, the set of δ giving α_1/α_2∈Q is countable: solving (δ−s)/(δ+1−2s)=p/q yields a single δ for each p/q. Hence we can pick δ outside this countable set.
- Example with explicit numbers (numerics only to guide checking): Take s=√2/10≈0.141421, L_1=L_3=s, L_2=1−2s≈0.717158. Pick δ=0.241421 (which lies in (s,2s)). Then set a_1=0, a_2=δ, and a_3 ≡ 1−3s+2δ (mod 1) ≈ 0.058578. This A supports both orders O1 and O2, giving α_1≈0.100000 and α_2≈0.958579. By the argument above, α_1/α_2 is irrational for generic δ (here δ is irrational), so we expect incommensurability; the exact rational obstruction would force δ to be a specific rational function of s and p/q, which it is not.

Irreducibility of the constructed tilings (singleton case)
- Claim: If K contains 0 and 1 and |T_n|=1 for all n, then the tiling T is irreducible. Reason: Suppose T=T_1⊔T_2 yields a partition Z=X_1⊔X_2 with A+T_i=X_i×S^1. If n∈X_1, then row n is covered by intervals coming from k=0 (index n) and k=1 (index n−1). Thus θ_n,θ_{n−1} must belong to T_1. Iterating forces all θ_m into T_1, so T_2=∅. Thus no nontrivial splitting exists.
- Therefore, both singleton tilings constructed from O1 and O2 are irreducible.

Non-column property
- Heuristic/likely sufficient condition: If the set of k-positions contains at least two distinct values and the lengths contain an irrational (e.g., take s irrational with L_1=L_3=s and L_2=1−2s), then A is not a column. Sketch: A column tiling A+T_col=X×S^1 with X finite forces, at each row n∈X, integer counts c_{i,n} satisfying ∑_i c_{i,n}L_i=1. With L_i irrationally related to 1, this severely restricts the possible c_{i,n} (often forcing a unique pattern), and compatibility across rows (given that each translate contributes to several rows simultaneously) becomes impossible unless K has a single position. I will turn this into a fully rigorous lemma next round by formalizing the linear algebra and the “row coupling” constraint induced by K={0,1,2}. For concreteness in the example above, with s irrational, I claim A is not a column.

Why this matters here
- The construction above gives a concrete, checkable candidate answering the main question in the affirmative: a non-column tile A that admits two different irreducible tilings T and T′ with periods (1,α_1) and (1,α_2) such that α_1/α_2∉Q.
- The argument isolates a minimal mechanism: two admissible cyclic orders yield two different α, and choosing lengths with a symmetry (L_1=L_3) synchronizes the order-compatibility congruences.

What to verify explicitly (auditable checks)
1) Fiber finiteness: At each n, check ∑_i (#T_{n−k_i})L_i=1 for singleton tilings (obvious here: the two/equivalently three intervals partition S^1). 2) For O1 and O2: compute the three interval endpoints at row n in terms of θ_n and verify pairwise adjacencies:
   - O1 yields [θ_n+a_1, θ_n+a_1+L_1], [θ_{n−1}+a_2, θ_{n−1}+a_2+L_2], [θ_{n−2}+a_3, θ_{n−2}+a_3+L_3], where with α_1 and the congruence a_1−2a_2+a_3≡1−3s, one has
     θ_n+a_1+L_1 = θ_{n−1}+a_2 = θ_{n−2}+a_3+L_3 and θ_{n−2}+a_3+L_3+L_2 = θ_n+a_1+1.
   - O2 similarly gives adjacencies in the order (1,3,2) using α_2.
   These equalities are straightforward algebra using θ_{n−j} = θ_n − jα and the displayed formulas for α_1,α_2.
3) Irreducibility: As above, closure under predecessors 0 and 1 forces trivial splitting.
4) Incommensurability: For fixed irrational s and δ∈(s,2s), α_1/α_2 is irrational for all but countably many δ, so choose δ irrational (e.g., δ=s+√2/100) to ensure α_1/α_2∉Q.
5) Non-column: To be completed rigorously; the intended proof will show for K={0,1,2} and s irrational that no finite X can satisfy the per-row linear constraints compatibly with the multirow effect of each translate.

Obstacles and corrections
- Earlier (false) idea fixed: “α must be rational” was based on misreading T_{r+k}=T_r+α as T_r=T_r+α. The corrected view allows α irrational, fitting the problem’s aim.
- The non-column proof needs to be written cleanly; I have a clear route (row-coupled integer equations with an irrational parameter) and will supply details next.

Next steps
- Write the formal proof that the concrete A with K={0,1,2}, L_1=L_3=s irrational, L_2=1−2s, and a_1,a_2,a_3 satisfying a_1−2a_2+a_3≡1−3s, is not a column.
- Generalize the “two-order mechanism” beyond K={0,1,2}: characterize when multiple cyclic orders are simultaneously admissible and list the resulting α as Z-linear forms in L_i.
- Explore whether more than two incommensurable periods can be realized by the same tile (e.g., three different orders), and whether singleton assumption can be relaxed while keeping irreducibility.


=== prover-02.out.json (progress_md) ===
Status and plan
- I could not read output.md (not provided), so I proceed with a self-contained candidate construction and a few clean lemmas with proofs that can be verified directly.
- Goal here: give an explicit non-column tile A that admits two different irreducible tilings T, T′ of Z×S^1 with periods (1,α) and (1,α′) such that α/α′∉Q. Each claim below is small and testable.

Idea: two-layer tile enforcing a constant phase increment
- Use only two vertical layers k=0 and k=1. A translate of A centered at integer z contributes sets on rows z and z+1. If, on every row n, the union of the contributions from z=n and z=n−1 exactly partitions S^1, we get a tiling. If that partition forces θ_n−θ_{n−1} to be a prescribed increment, we obtain a “helical” period (1,α).
- We design the layers so that two different increments α and α+1/2 both work. Choosing α irrational ensures α/(α+1/2) is irrational.

Explicit construction
- Pick a finite union U⊂S^1 of disjoint intervals with 0<|U|<1/2 (e.g., U=[0,0.2)∪[0.3,0.35)).
- Define J_0 := U ∪ (U+1/2). Then J_0 is a finite union of intervals and has 1/2-periodicity: J_0+1/2 = J_0.
- Fix α∈S^1\Q (e.g., α=√2/10 mod 1). Define J_1 := S^1 \ (J_0+α). This is also a finite union of intervals.
- Define the tile A := ({0}×J_0) ∪ ({1}×J_1).

Lemma 1 (Two periodic tilings exist)
Claim. For the tile A above there exist tilings T_α and T_{α+1/2} with periods (1,α) and (1,α+1/2), respectively.
Proof. For T_α, let T_α := {(z, θ_0+zα): z∈Z} for any θ_0∈S^1. On row n, the two contributing translates are from z=n (layer 0) and z=n−1 (layer 1), giving sets (J_0+θ_n) and (J_1+θ_{n−1}), where θ_n=θ_0+nα. Since J_1=S^1\(J_0+α), we have J_1+θ_{n−1}=S^1\(J_0+θ_{n−1}+α)=S^1\(J_0+θ_n). Thus these two sets are complementary (overlaps only at endpoints; measure zero), so every row is perfectly tiled. The set T_α is invariant under (1,α), so T_α has period (1,α).
For T_{α+1/2}, define T_{α+1/2} analogously with θ'_n=θ'_0+n(α+1/2). Using J_0+1/2=J_0, we get J_0+θ'_n = J_0+(θ'_{n−1}+α+1/2) = J_0+(θ'_{n−1}+α). Hence J_1+θ'_{n−1}=S^1\(J_0+θ'_n). So the same complement argument yields a tiling with period (1,α+1/2). ∎

Lemma 2 (A is not a column)
Claim. The tile A does not tile any finite set {n_1,…,n_m}×S^1.
Proof. Any single translate of A contributes on exactly two adjacent rows. Suppose A+T_f={n_1,…,n_m}×S^1 for finite T_f. Let n_max be the largest row in {n_1,…,n_m}. In row n_max, coverage requires two contributions: one from layer 0 at z=n_max and one from layer 1 at z=n_max−1 (since neither J_0 nor J_1 alone has full measure). If z=n_max∈T_f, then that translate also covers row n_max+1 (outside the target), contradiction. If we try to avoid z=n_max by only using z=n_max−1, we still fail because J_1 alone has measure <1 and cannot cover the whole circle. Thus no finite T_f works. ∎

Lemma 3 (Irreducibility)
Claim. Every tiling of Z×S^1 by A of the form constructed in Lemma 1 is irreducible.
Proof. Suppose T splits as a disjoint union T_1⊔T_2 with Z partitioned into X_1⊔X_2 and A+T_i=X_i×S^1. If n∈X_1, then row n must be covered by contributions from z=n (layer 0) and z=n−1 (layer 1). Therefore (n,θ_n) and (n−1,θ_{n−1}) must both belong to T_1; otherwise A+T_1 would not cover row n. But then row n−1 uses (n−1,θ_{n−1}) and (n−2,θ_{n−2}), forcing (n−2,θ_{n−2})∈T_1 as well. Inducting both directions shows T_1 contains all anchors, hence X_1=Z and T_2=∅, i.e., the tiling is irreducible. ∎

Lemma 4 (Incommensurability)
Claim. If α∉Q, then α/(α+1/2)∉Q.
Proof. If α/(α+1/2)=p/q∈Q, then α = (p/q)(α+1/2), so α(1−p/q)=p/(2q), hence α = p/(2(q−p))∈Q, contradiction. ∎

Why this solves the posed existence question
- The tile A is not a column (Lemma 2).
- There are two different irreducible tilings T_α and T_{α+1/2} (Lemma 1, Lemma 3), with periods (1,α) and (1,α+1/2). Picking α irrational ensures the periods are incommensurable by Lemma 4.
- Everything is explicit and verifiable. One concrete choice is: U=[0,0.2)∪[0.3,0.35), α=√2/10 mod 1. Then J_0=U∪(U+1/2), J_1=S^1\(J_0+α), and A=({0}×J_0)∪({1}×J_1).

Fourier/quotient check (optional sanity)
- For k=1, the quotient G/⟨(1,α)⟩≅S^1. In the quotient, A projects to J_0 ⊔ (J_1−α). Our choice J_1=S^1\(J_0+α) is exactly the quotient tiling identity. The α→α+1/2 case follows since J_0 is 1/2-periodic.

Obstacles and caveats
- Endpoints produce at most measure-zero overlaps, allowed by the tiling definition. Choosing U with generic endpoints avoids any accidental positive-measure overlaps.

Next steps for the verifier
- Check the three lemmas directly for the explicit numeric example given above.
- Optionally generalize: taking J_0 to be 1/q-periodic yields q distinct tilings with periods (1,α+j/q), j=0,…,q−1. For any irrational α and any j≠0, α/(α+j/q) is irrational by the same algebra, giving many incommensurable options.

Gaps in output.md
- Not applicable; output.md was not provided in this round. If earlier outputs assert nonexistence or require stronger irreducibility notions, we should align definitions. The above argument relies only on the stated tiling, column, and irreducibility definitions in task.md.

=== prover-03.out.json (progress_md) ===
Status and files
- I do not see an output.md in this round; hence I cannot check or critique any curated results. I proceed to extract structure, prove small lemmas, and propose a concrete candidate construction to test.

Set-up: fiberization across the Z-coordinate
- Write T ⊆ Z × S^1 as fibers T_n := {θ ∈ S^1 : (n,θ) ∈ T}.
- For each m ∈ Z, the a.e. disjoint covering condition is
  ∑_{i=1}^ℓ ∑_{φ∈T_{m-k_i}} 1_{[a_i,b_i]}(·−φ) = 1  a.e. on S^1.
  Equivalently, for each m the circle S^1 is a.e. partitioned by the intervals [a_i,b_i] translated by all φ∈T_{m-k_i}.

Basic necessary conditions
- Finite fibers: For each n, T_n must be finite. Reason: in column m, the pieces are disjoint a.e.; the total measure equals ∑_i |I_i|·|T_{m-k_i}| = 1; since |I_i|>0, |T_{m-k_i}| are bounded, hence finite.
- Reducibility obstruction (gcd): Let K={k_1,…,k_ℓ} and H:=⟨K−K⟩≤Z. If H≠Z (i.e., gcd{k_i−k_j}>1), then any tiling splits along residue classes mod H, hence is reducible by grouping classes. Thus any irreducible tiling requires gcd{k_i−k_j}=1.

Irreducibility lemma for “one translate per fiber”
- Ansatz: suppose |T_n|=1 for all n, say T_n={θ_n}. Then the covering of column m uses exactly one translate of [a_i,b_i] coming from θ_{m−k_i} for each i.
- Claim: If gcd{k_i−k_j}=1 then any such tiling is irreducible. Proof: Suppose Z=X_1⊔X_2 and T=T_1⊔T_2 produce A+T_i=X_i×S^1. If m∈X_1, then to cover S^1 at column m using only T_1 we must have m−k_i∈X_1 for all i (since each of the ℓ necessary pieces comes from a distinct index m−k_i). Hence X_1 is closed under subtraction by each k_i. Now take any i,j. If m∈X_1 then m−k_i∈X_1; if m+(k_j−k_i)∉X_1 (i.e. in X_2), column m+(k_j−k_i) to be covered by T_2 would require (m+(k_j−k_i))−k_j = m−k_i ∈ X_2, contradicting m−k_i∈X_1. Thus X_1 is closed under addition by all differences k_j−k_i, so X_1 is a union of cosets of H=⟨K−K⟩=Z, hence X_1 is either ∅ or Z. So the tiling is irreducible.

One-translate-per-fiber reduces to linear congruences
- Suppose |T_n|=1 and write θ_n=u+nβ (period (1,β)). Assume at each column the ℓ intervals appear in a fixed cyclic order σ on {1,…,ℓ}. The adjacency condition along the circle is, for each i,
  θ_{m−k_{σ(i)}} + a_{σ(i)} ≡ θ_{m−k_i} + a_i + c_i (mod 1),
  with c_i = b_i−a_i. Eliminating m gives the family of congruences
  (k_i−k_{σ(i)}) β ≡ a_i + c_i − a_{σ(i)} (mod 1),  i=1,…,ℓ.
  Summing these yields an identity (since ∑ c_i=1≡0 in S^1), so there are ℓ−1 independent constraints.

Two tilings from one tile when ℓ=3 and K={0,1,2}
- Take ℓ=3 with offsets (k_1,k_2,k_3)=(0,1,2); lengths c_1,c_2,c_3>0, c_1+c_2+c_3=1.
- Consider two cyclic orders: σ=(1→2→3→1) and σ'=(1→3→2→1) (reverse).
- Solving the congruences shows a compatibility criterion and a relation between the two period slopes:
  • The two orders are simultaneously compatible for the same endpoints a_i iff c_1=c_3.
  • When c_1=c_3, if the first tiling has slope β (so T has period (1,α) with α=β), then the reversed-order tiling exists for the same tile A with slope β' ≡ β − c_1 (mod 1) (hence period (1,α') with α'=β').
  Sketch: Write the σ-congruences as −β ≡ a_1+c_1−a_2, −β ≡ a_2+c_2−a_3, 2β ≡ a_3+c_3−a_1. From these define a_2,a_3 in terms of a_1,β,c’s. The σ'-congruences become −2β' ≡ a_1+c_1−a_3, β' ≡ a_2+c_2−a_1, β' ≡ a_3+c_3−a_2. Substituting a_2,a_3 from σ, the three congruences are consistent iff c_1=c_3, and then force β' ≡ β − c_1 (mod 1).

Non-column property
- Claim: The above A (with one interval in each of the three columns 0,1,2, with lengths c_1,c_2,c_3 and c_1=c_3≠c_2) is not a column. Reason: If A tiled {n_1,n_2,n_3}×S^1 by a set Θ⊂S^1 of vertical shifts only, then in particular the column with length c_2 would be tiled by |Θ| disjoint copies of an interval of length c_2, forcing |Θ|·c_2=1. The columns with length c_1 satisfy |Θ|·c_1=1 as well. These equalities imply c_1=c_2, contrary to c_2=1−2c_1 (unless c_1=c_2=1/3, which we avoid by choosing c_1≠1/3). More generally, a single finite Θ cannot tile S^1 simultaneously by disjoint copies of two different lengths with total measure 1 in each column.

Incommensurable periods via a concrete choice
- Choose c_1=c_3=2/5, c_2=1−2c_1=1/5. Pick any irrational β∈(0,1) (e.g., β=√2/4). Set a_1 arbitrarily (say 0), and define
  a_2 ≡ a_1 + c_1 − (k_1−k_2)β = c_1 + β,
  a_3 ≡ a_2 + c_2 − (k_2−k_3)β = c_1 + c_2 + 2β,
  all modulo 1. This fixes the tile A.
- Then:
  • T = {(n, u+nβ): n∈Z} is an irreducible tiling with period (1,α) where α=β, using cyclic order 1→2→3→1.
  • T' = {(n, u'+nβ'): n∈Z} with β'≡β−c_1 (mod 1) is an irreducible tiling with period (1,α') where α'=β', using cyclic order 1→3→2→1.
- Incommensurability: Since c_1=2/5 is rational and β is irrational, the ratio α/α' is irrational. Indeed, if α/α'∈Q, then α = r α' for some rational r; but α'≡α−c_1 (or α'≡α+1−c_1 depending on the representative in [0,1)), yielding α = r(α±(1−c_1)), so α is rational—contradiction. A short algebraic check: α/(α−c_1)=p/q ⇒ α = (p c_1)/(q−p) ∈ Q.

Worked numeric instance (sanity check)
- Take β=√2/4≈0.353553, c_1=c_3=0.4, c_2=0.2, a_1=0.
  Then a_2≈0.753553, a_3≈0.307106. Forward tiling at column m=0 uses the three arcs [0,0.4], [0.4,0.6], [0.6,1] (disjoint cover). The reversed tiling uses β'≡β−0.4≡0.953553; at m=0 the arcs are [0,0.4], [0.4,0.8], [0.8,1] (disjoint cover). Both tilings are irreducible by the lemma. The ratio α/α'≈0.37… is irrational by the argument above.

Why useful here
- This furnishes a concrete family of tiles A (not columns) with two different irreducible periodic tilings whose vertical periods are incommensurable. It suggests a positive resolution to the existence question.

Open checks and potential gaps to verify rigorously
- Endpoints are measured-zero; ensure no overlaps except at endpoints—true by construction since adjacencies are exact.
- The non-column argument: formalize that a common finite Θ cannot simultaneously partition the circle with two different interval lengths summing to 1. The counting |Θ|·c=1 for each column is immediate from disjointness; equality for two different c’s forces equality of lengths. This can be stated and proved succinctly.
- Irreducibility lemma is proved for the 1-per-fiber case; this covers our construction. A verifier may want to write it as a formal implication: m∈X_1 ⇒ m−k_i∈X_1 for all i; then show closure under additions of differences using the complement X_2 and the covering requirement.

Ideas for generalization and next steps
- Formalize and record in output.md: (1) gcd-necessity lemma; (2) one-translate-per-fiber congruence system; (3) irreducibility lemma for one-translate-per-fiber; (4) the ℓ=3, K={0,1,2}, c_1=c_3 construction giving two tilings with β'≡β−c_1; (5) non-column criterion.
- Explore whether other pairs of permutations σ,σ' give different linear relations among β,β' for broader families (possibly yielding richer parameter sets or more than two tilings).
- Fourier viewpoint: For completeness, note that for general tilings (not necessarily |T_n|=1), the nonzero Fourier modes satisfy linear recurrences whose characteristic equation involves the coefficients sin(π t c_i)/(π t) and can constrain possible periods. Recording this could help classify when multiple periodic tilings exist.
