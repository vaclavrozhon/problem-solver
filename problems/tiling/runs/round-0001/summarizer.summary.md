This round produced multiple explicit constructions showing a non-column finite tile A ⊂ Z×S^1 can admit two distinct irreducible periodic tilings with incommensurable vertical shifts. Two mechanisms emerged: (a) a 3-layer singleton-per-row scheme (K={0,1,2}) where two different cyclic orders of the three intervals give two different slopes α, α' (synchronizing conditions achieved when L_1=L_3); (b) a 2-layer construction (K={0,1}) using a 1/2-periodic layer J_0 that yields tilings with slopes α and α+1/2. Both approaches include proofs of irreducibility and arguments that the tile is not a column (the 3-layer non-column argument is sketched and planned to be formalized). Choosing irrational length parameters (or irrational shift α) gives α/α'∉Q. Verifier: success. Citations: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json, prover-03.out.json.
