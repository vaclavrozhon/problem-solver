  "feedback_md": "High-level assessment: All three reports make real progress. Reports 01 and 03 correctly develop the \u201csingleton per fiber\u201d (= one anchor per row) linear-congruence framework and identify a robust mechanism to realize two distinct helical periods for the same tile when K={0,1,2} and c1=c3. Report 02 presents a different, very clean construction that directly enforces two distinct periods (1,\u03b1) and (1,\u03b1+1/2) via complementary layers. This latter construction is explicit and easy to verify; with a small fix to the non-column proof it gives a complete solution to the existence question.\n\nDetailed audit per prover\n- Prover 01\n  \u2022 Correct and useful: fiber finiteness; period transport across fibers; the singleton-tiling structural form (fixed cyclic order and a row phase), and the derived congruences. Your O1/O2 computation for K={0,1,2} matches the general congruence system (see Prover 03). The irreducibility argument for singleton tilings when {0,1}\u2282K is sound. The \u201cgeneric incommensurability\u201d argument is fine: for fixed s, the set of \u03b4 giving rational ratio is countable.\n  \u2022 Caveat: The non-column proof is not yet rigorous. Keep it in notes; do not claim it in output. A clean route is the per-row measure equations and boundary recurrence method used below to fix Prover 02\u2019s argument.\n\n- Prover 02\n  \u2022 Strong: The construction A=({0}\u00d7J0)\u222a({1}\u00d7J1) with J1=S^1\\(J0+\u03b1) and J0 1/2-periodic produces two distinct tilings with periods (1,\u03b1) and (1,\u03b1+1/2), and the irreducibility/incommensurability lemmas are correct and clean (your Lemmas 1, 3, 4 are fine). This is an excellent backbone result.\n  \u2022 Issue: Lemma 2 (non-column) as written is flawed. The claim \u201crow n_max requires contributions from z=n_max and z=n_max\u22121\u201d is not justified\u2014one could try to cover a row purely by multiple copies of a single layer. However, this can be fixed rigorously by combining (i) per-row measure constraints and (ii) a boundary recurrence to force a row that is covered by copies of one layer only, and then (iii) a component-length obstruction forbidding two disjoint translates of J0 (or J1) to partition S^1. Concretely, if |J0|=|J1|=1/2 and there is no \u03b4 with J0+\u03b4 = S^1\\J0, then no finite-column tiling exists. Picking U with two different interval lengths (as in your example) ensures this property (because translation preserves the multiset of component lengths, which differs between J0 and its complement).\n\n- Prover 03\n  \u2022 Correct and valuable: the gcd obstruction and the irreducibility lemma for singleton tilings (gcd(K\u2212K)=1). Your linear congruence formulation (k_i\u2212k_{\u03c3(i)})\u03b2 \u2261 a_i+c_i\u2212a_{\u03c3(i)} (mod 1), and the derivation for \u2113=3, K={0,1,2} that simultaneous orders are compatible iff c1=c3, with \u03b2'\u2261\u03b2\u2212c1, are right and match Prover 01\u2019s formulas. The numeric check is consistent.\n  \u2022 Caveat: The \u201cnon-column\u201d reasoning assumes a product form T=X\u00d7\u0398 and is too restrictive. Use the general T and the fixed proof pattern outlined in the bullet for Prover 02.\n\nWhat we can safely record in output.md now\n- A complete, explicit existence theorem: choose J0 of measure 1/2 with no translational complement (e.g., J0 = U\u222a(U+1/2) with U=[0,0.2)\u222a[0.3,0.35)); define J1=S^1\\(J0+\u03b1) with any irrational \u03b1\u2208(0,1/2). Then:\n  1) A admits two irreducible periodic tilings with periods (1,\u03b1) and (1,\u03b1+1/2).\n  2) The two periods are incommensurable.\n  3) A is not a column (by the repaired argument above).\n- General lemmas: fiber finiteness; gcd obstruction and irreducibility for singleton tilings; singleton congruence system; the \u2113=3, K={0,1,2}, c1=c3 two-order mechanism, including \u03b2'\u2261\u03b2\u2212c1. These are self-contained, fully checkable, and relevant.\n\nPromising next steps\n- Generalize Prover 02\u2019s q-periodic idea: if J0 is 1/q-periodic, you get q tilings with periods (1,\u03b1+j/q), 0\u2264j\u2264q\u22121. With \u03b1 irrational and j\u22600, the ratios are irrational by the same algebra. Formalize the non-column criterion for general q (a boundary recurrence will force a row covered by only one layer, hence a \u201ctranslational complement\u201d obstruction again).\n- For the K={0,1,2} singleton family, give a clean, independent non-column criterion (e.g., using the same measure-recurrence idea applied to any putative finite-column tiling, but now with lengths c1,c2,c3 and gcd constraint). This would yield a second, independent existence family.\n- Explore whether more than two incommensurable periods can be realized via multiple admissible orders beyond the c1=c3 case, and whether singleton can be relaxed while keeping irreducibility.\n",
  "new_notes_md": "Set-up and notation\n- Work in G = Z \u00d7 S^1 (S^1 = R/Z). A tile A is a finite union of layers of the form {k_i}\u00d7[a_i,b_i] with 0 < b_i\u2212a_i < 1, i=1,\u2026,\u2113. A tiling T \u2282 Z\u00d7S^1 is a set of translations such that the (almost everywhere) disjoint union of A+(n,\u03b8) over (n,\u03b8)\u2208T equals Z\u00d7S^1. The fiber at n is T_n := {\u03b8 \u2208 S^1 : (n,\u03b8) \u2208 T}. A period (k,\u03b1) means T+(k,\u03b1)=T.\n\nBasic facts\n- Fiber finiteness. In any tiling, every T_n is finite, and for each m we have \u2211_i |T_{m\u2212k_i}|\u00b7(b_i\u2212a_i) = 1.\n- Period transport. If (k,\u03b1) is a period then T_{n+k} = T_n + \u03b1 for all n.\n\nSingleton-per-row tilings\n- Definition: |T_n|=1 for all n. Write T_n={\u03b8_n}. Then column m is the (a.e.) disjoint union of the \u2113 intervals [a_i+\u03b8_{m\u2212k_i}, b_i+\u03b8_{m\u2212k_i}], i=1,\u2026,\u2113.\n- Fixed cyclic order formulation. If, at each m, the \u2113 intervals appear in the same cyclic order \u03c3 and meet end-to-end, then for some row phase \u03c6_m one has \u03b8_{m\u2212k_i} = \u03c6_m + c_i \u2212 a_i, where c_i are order-dependent constants with c_{\u03c3(i)} \u2261 c_i + (b_i\u2212a_i) (mod 1). Consequently \u03b8_{m\u2212k_i} \u2212 \u03b8_{m\u2212k_j} is independent of m. If 1\u2208{k_i}, then \u03b8_n\u2212\u03b8_{n\u22121} is constant, i.e. T has period (1,\u03b2) with \u03b2 := \u03b8_n\u2212\u03b8_{n\u22121}.\n- Linear congruence system (Prover 03). Under a fixed order \u03c3,\n  (k_i \u2212 k_{\u03c3(i)}) \u03b2 \u2261 a_i + (b_i\u2212a_i) \u2212 a_{\u03c3(i)}  (mod 1),  i=1,\u2026,\u2113.\n  For \u2113=3, K={0,1,2}, and orders \u03c3=(1\u21922\u21923\u21921), \u03c3'=(1\u21923\u21922\u21921), the two orders are simultaneously compatible for the same endpoints a_i iff c_1=c_3, and then the slopes satisfy \u03b2' \u2261 \u03b2 \u2212 c_1 (mod 1). This yields two distinct singleton tilings for the same tile when c_1=c_3.\n- Irreducibility (singleton, gcd=1). Let H:=\u27e8K\u2212K\u27e9\u2264Z. If H\u2260Z then any tiling splits along residue classes mod H; hence irreducibility forces H=Z. Moreover, if |T_n|=1 and H=Z then any partition T=T_1\u2294T_2 induces Z=X_1\u2294X_2 with X_1 closed under subtraction by each k_i and hence under \u00b1(K\u2212K); since H=Z, X_1 is either \u2205 or Z. Thus singleton tilings with gcd(K\u2212K)=1 are irreducible.\n\nTwo complementary-layer construction (explicit)\n- Choose U\u2282S^1 a finite union of disjoint intervals with |U|=1/4 and U\u2229(U+1/2)=\u2205 (e.g., U=[0,0.2)\u222a[0.3,0.35)). Let J_0:=U\u222a(U+1/2). Then |J_0|=1/2 and J_0+1/2=J_0. Pick an irrational \u03b1\u2208(0,1/2), and set J_1:=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1). Define A:=({0}\u00d7J_0)\u222a({1}\u00d7J_1).\n- Two tilings. For any \u03b8_0, define T_\u03b1={ (n, \u03b8_0+n\u03b1): n\u2208Z }. On row n the contributions are (J_0+\u03b8_n) and (J_1+\u03b8_{n\u22121}) with \u03b8_n=\u03b8_0+n\u03b1, which are complementary because J_1=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1). Thus A+T_\u03b1=Z\u00d7S^1 a.e., and T_\u03b1 has period (1,\u03b1). Using J_0+1/2=J_0 the same argument works for \u03b1' := \u03b1+1/2, giving a tiling T_{\u03b1'} with period (1,\u03b1'). Both are singleton tilings, hence irreducible by the lemma above (K={0,1} has gcd 1).\n- Incommensurability. If \u03b1\u2209Q, then \u03b1/(\u03b1+1/2)\u2209Q: from \u03b1/(\u03b1+1/2)=p/q one deduces \u03b1=p/(2(q\u2212p))\u2208Q, a contradiction.\n- Non-column property (finite-column tilings impossible). Say A+T=X\u00d7S^1 with X finite. Let d_n:=|T_n|. On row n the union is a.e. disjoint, so |J_0| d_n + |J_1| d_{n\u22121} = 1_{n\u2208X}. With |J_0|=|J_1|=1/2 this yields d_n + d_{n\u22121} = 2\u00b71_{n\u2208X}. Because X is finite, d_n=0 for all n sufficiently large/small. At the left boundary p of any connected component of X, we get d_{p\u22121}=0 and hence d_p=2; so row p is tiled by two disjoint translates of J_0 alone. Therefore S^1 is a.e. the disjoint union of two translates of J_0, which forces J_0+\u03b4 = S^1\\J_0 for some \u03b4. Our choice of U ensures this is impossible (the multiset of lengths of connected components of J_0 differs from that of its complement). Hence no such finite X exists: A is not a column.\n\nConsequences\n- This explicit A is a non-column tile that admits two irreducible periodic tilings with incommensurable vertical periods (1,\u03b1) and (1,\u03b1+1/2).\n- Independently, for \u2113=3 and K={0,1,2} with c_1=c_3, the congruence mechanism produces two distinct singleton tilings of the same tile with slopes \u03b2 and \u03b2'\u2261\u03b2\u2212c_1. Picking \u03b2 irrational makes \u03b2/(\u03b2') irrational unless a rational relation holds; such relations are at most countable in the parameter.\n\nNext directions\n- q-periodic generalization: If J_0 has 1/q-periodicity, the same complementary construction yields q tilings with slopes \u03b1+j/q; non-column persists under the same \u201cno translational complement\u201d obstruction.\n- Non-column for K={0,1,2} singleton tiles: adapt the boundary-recurrence method with |J_\u2022| = c_\u2022 to force a boundary row covered by a single layer, then forbid that layer from tiling S^1 by finitely many translates via a connected-component-length invariant.\n",
  "new_notes_append": "True",
  "new_outputs_md": "Summary of proven results and why they matter\n- Main existence theorem. We construct an explicit tile A\u2282Z\u00d7S^1 that is not a column but admits two irreducible tilings with periods (1,\u03b1) and (1,\u03b1+1/2), where \u03b1 is irrational; the two periods are incommensurable. This settles the core existence question positively.\n- General structure for singleton tilings. We record a concise congruence system that reduces the singleton-per-row case to linear congruences, and an irreducibility criterion (gcd(K\u2212K)=1).\n- Two-order mechanism for K={0,1,2}. When c_1=c_3, a single tile admits two distinct singleton tilings corresponding to the cyclic orders (1\u21922\u21923\u21921) and (1\u21923\u21922\u21921); the slopes differ by c_1 modulo 1. This gives a second, independent family of examples (pending a non-column verification).\n\nTheorem A (Non-column tile with two incommensurable periods). Fix an irrational \u03b1\u2208(0,1/2). Let U\u2282S^1 be a finite union of disjoint intervals of total length 1/4 such that U\u2229(U+1/2)=\u2205 and the multiset of lengths of connected components of U is different from that of its complement in [0,1/2). Define J_0:=U\u222a(U+1/2) (so |J_0|=1/2 and J_0+1/2=J_0), J_1:=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1), and set A:=( {0}\u00d7J_0 ) \u222a ( {1}\u00d7J_1 ). Then:\n(i) There is a tiling T_\u03b1 with period (1,\u03b1), and a tiling T_{\u03b1+1/2} with period (1,\u03b1+1/2).\n(ii) Both tilings are irreducible.\n(iii) A is not a column (i.e., there is no finite X\u2282Z and T\u2282Z\u00d7S^1 with A+T=X\u00d7S^1).\n(iv) The periods are incommensurable: \u03b1/(\u03b1+1/2)\u2209Q.\nProof.\n(i) Define T_\u03b1:={(n,\u03b8_0+n\u03b1): n\u2208Z}. On row n the contributions are (J_0+\u03b8_n) with \u03b8_n=\u03b8_0+n\u03b1 and (J_1+\u03b8_{n\u22121}). Since J_1=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1), we have J_1+\u03b8_{n\u22121}=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b8_{n\u22121}+\u03b1)=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b8_n). Thus these two sets are complementary (disjoint a.e. and union S^1), giving a tiling. The definition is invariant under (1,\u03b1), so T_\u03b1 has period (1,\u03b1). For \u03b1' := \u03b1+1/2, define T_{\u03b1'} analogously; the identity J_0+1/2=J_0 yields J_1+\u03b8'_{n\u22121}=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b8'_n), so T_{\u03b1'} tiles with period (1,\u03b1').\n(ii) These are singleton tilings with K={0,1}; since gcd{0\u22120,0\u22121,1\u22120,1\u22121}=1, the irreducibility lemma below applies.\n(iii) Suppose A+T=X\u00d7S^1 with X finite. Let d_n:=|T_n|. By a.e. disjointness, on each n\u2208Z we have |J_0| d_n + |J_1| d_{n\u22121} = 1_{n\u2208X}. Since |J_0|=|J_1|=1/2, this simplifies to d_n + d_{n\u22121} = 2\u00b71_{n\u2208X}. Because X is finite, d_n=0 for all sufficiently large |n|; in particular, at the left endpoint p of any connected component of X we have d_{p\u22121}=0, hence d_p=2. Thus row p is tiled entirely by two disjoint translates of J_0. This forces S^1 to be a.e. the disjoint union of two translates of J_0, i.e., J_0+\u03b4 = S^1\\J_0 for some \u03b4. But translation preserves the multiset of connected-component lengths, which by construction differs between J_0 and its complement (coming from the complement of U in [0,1/2)), a contradiction. Therefore A admits no finite-column tiling.\n(iv) If \u03b1/(\u03b1+1/2)=p/q\u2208Q, then \u03b1 = (p/q)(\u03b1+1/2), so \u03b1(1\u2212p/q)=p/(2q), hence \u03b1=p/(2(q\u2212p))\u2208Q, contradicting the choice of \u03b1.\n\u220e\n\nLemma B (Irreducibility for singleton tilings with gcd(K\u2212K)=1). Let A have layers at K={k_1,\u2026,k_\u2113} and suppose |T_n|=1 for all n (singleton). Let H:=\u27e8K\u2212K\u27e9\u2264Z. If H=Z then any tiling is irreducible: any putative partition T=T_1\u2294T_2 forces the index set X_1={n: T_n\u2282T_1} to be closed under subtraction by each k_i and hence under \u00b1(K\u2212K); since H=Z, X_1 is either \u2205 or Z.\nProof. As sketched; the closure shows X_1 is a union of cosets of H=Z, hence trivial.\n\u220e\n\nLemma C (Singleton congruences under a fixed cyclic order). Assume |T_n|=1 and the \u2113 intervals appear in a fixed cyclic order \u03c3 on every row. Then if \u03b2:=\u03b8_n\u2212\u03b8_{n\u22121} (mod 1), the adjacency constraints are equivalent to the congruence system\n (k_i \u2212 k_{\u03c3(i)}) \u03b2 \u2261 a_i + (b_i\u2212a_i) \u2212 a_{\u03c3(i)}  (mod 1), i=1,\u2026,\u2113.\nProof. Writing \u03b8_{m\u2212k_i}=\u03c6_m + c_i \u2212 a_i and matching consecutive endpoints in order \u03c3 gives the displayed congruences.\n\u220e\n\nProposition D (Two orders for K={0,1,2}). Let \u2113=3, K=(0,1,2), c_i=b_i\u2212a_i>0 with c_1+c_2+c_3=1. Consider orders \u03c3=(1\u21922\u21923\u21921) and \u03c3'=(1\u21923\u21922\u21921). Then the two orders are simultaneously compatible for the same endpoints a_i iff c_1=c_3. In that case, if the first tiling has slope \u03b2, the second has slope \u03b2'\u2261\u03b2\u2212c_1 (mod 1).\nProof. Apply Lemma C to \u03c3 and \u03c3', solve the \u03c3-system for a_2,a_3 in terms of a_1,\u03b2,c\u2019s, and substitute into the \u03c3'-system. Consistency is equivalent to c_1=c_3, and then \u03b2' is forced to equal \u03b2\u2212c_1 (mod 1).\n\u220e\n",
