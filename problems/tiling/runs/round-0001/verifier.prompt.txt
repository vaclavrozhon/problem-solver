You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md and output.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers
- notes.md (summary so far)
- output.md (rigorously proven results so far)

Guidelines:
- notes.md: should be a readable running log of interesting work. Prefer appending. Replace only if old notes are clearly misleading. Remember -- notes should be self-contained and should make sense even without seeing outputs of past provers. 
- output.md:  Think twice before you add something to this file. Everything here should be rigorous, almost publication-ready. It should contain only fully proven theorems that are clearly an interesting step towards the solution (or the solution itself). The beginning of the file is a clear list of interesting theorems you can prove, together with a discussion about why it is relevant. From the statement of the theorem it has to be clear that this constitutes nontrivial progress towards solution. The rest of the file contains a fully rigorous list of the proofs of the theorems. Keep only proven theorems with clear proofs. If a statement in that file is flawed / unprecise and you cannot fix it on the spot, remove it from output.md and instead add it to notes.md with explanation.
- Be careful with the booleans `new_notes_append` and `new_outputs_append`: default is True (append). Use False only when deliberately rewriting everything.

Tasks:
1) Audit rigor: identify unjustified steps, false statements, missing lemmas; produce minimal counterexamples.
2) Triage value: separate genuine progress from noise.
3) Guide next steps: propose what provers should try next.

All comments below are new incremental ideas with self-contained checks.\n\nSet-up and a useful general observation\n- Fiber finiteness lemma. In any tiling A+T of Z\u00d7S^1 as in the task (with at least one interval of positive length), each fiber T_n := {\u03b8 \u2208 S^1 : (n,\u03b8)\u2208T} is finite. Reason: At fixed n, the S^1-cover is a disjoint union of translates of finitely many intervals of positive lengths L_i=b_i\u2212a_i. The total measure equals 1, so \u2211_i (#T_{n\u2212k_i})\u00b7L_i=1; hence all #T_{n\u2212k_i}<\u221e.\n- Period transport across fibers. If T has period (k,\u03b1), then for every n, T_{n+k} = T_n + \u03b1 (Minkowski sum in S^1). In particular, for fixed residue r mod k, the sequence (T_{r+jk})_j is obtained by rotating the finite set T_r by successive adds of \u03b1.\n- Caution (correcting a tempting misclaim): The above does NOT imply \u03b1 is rational. The previous reasoning \u201cfinite set invariant under irrational rotation forces emptiness\u201d would require T_r = T_r + \u03b1, but here only T_{r+k} = T_r + \u03b1; T_r itself need not be invariant. So \u03b1 may be irrational.\n\nA tractable class: singleton-per-row tilings\n- We focus on the special case |T_n|=1 for all n (call these singleton tilings). Then T is determined by a sequence (\u03b8_n) with \u03b8_n \u2208 S^1.\n- Local-to-global structure: Write K={k_1,\u2026,k_\u2113} and L_i=b_i\u2212a_i. At row n, the \u2113 intervals are [a_i+\u03b8_{n\u2212k_i}, b_i+\u03b8_{n\u2212k_i}], i=1..\u2113. A partition of S^1 into these intervals (up to measure-zero overlaps) occurs iff there exist constants c_1,\u2026,c_\u2113 with c_{j+1}\u2212c_j = L_{i_j} in some cyclic order (i_1,\u2026,i_\u2113) of the indices, and a \u201crow phase\u201d \u03c6_n, such that for each i=i_j one has\n  \u03b8_{n\u2212k_i} = c_j \u2212 a_i + \u03c6_n.\n  Consequences:\n  1) For every i, j: \u03b8_{n\u2212k_i}\u2212\u03b8_{n\u2212k_j} = (c_j\u2212a_j)\u2212(c_i\u2212a_i) is independent of n.\n  2) In particular, if 1\u2208K (i.e., some k_i=1) then \u03b1:=\u03b8_n\u2212\u03b8_{n\u22121} is constant, i.e. \u03b8_n = \u03b8_0 + n\u03b1 and T has period (1,\u03b1).\n  3) The constant \u03b1 is a Z-linear combination of the lengths L_i (mod 1), determined by the chosen cyclic order and the offsets a_i. Thus different admissible cyclic orders can lead to different \u03b1 for the same tile A.\n\nConcrete mechanism for two different \u03b1 via two cyclic orders\n- Specialize to K={0,1,2}, \u2113=3, so rows n use the three phases \u03b8_n, \u03b8_{n\u22121}, \u03b8_{n\u22122}.\n- Fix |T_n|=1 for all n. For a given cyclic order of the types (i_1,i_2,i_3), the local partition at each row forces linear congruences among a_i and L_i and yields \u03b1 = \u03b8_n\u2212\u03b8_{n\u22121} as an explicit combination of a_i and L_i. Writing L_i for i=1,2,3 and taking k_1=0, k_2=1, k_3=2, one finds:\n  \u2022 For order O1=(1,2,3) around the circle, consistency (global solvability) is equivalent to\n    a_1 \u2212 2 a_2 + a_3 \u2261 \u2212L_1 + L_2  (mod 1),\n    and then \u03b1_1 \u2261 (a_2 \u2212 a_1) \u2212 L_1  (mod 1).\n  \u2022 For order O2=(1,3,2), consistency is equivalent to\n    a_1 \u2212 2 a_2 + a_3 \u2261 \u2212L_1 \u2212 2L_3  (mod 1),\n    and then \u03b1_2 \u2261 (a_2 \u2212 a_1) + L_2 \u2212 1  (mod 1).\n- A compatibility trick: If we impose L_1=L_3=:s, then the two congruences coincide (both sides equal 1\u22123s). Thus, by choosing a_1,a_2 freely and setting a_3 to satisfy\n  a_1 \u2212 2 a_2 + a_3 \u2261 1 \u2212 3 s  (mod 1),\n  the same tile A admits singleton tilings in both cyclic orders O1 and O2. For this tile, the two periods are\n  \u03b1_1 \u2261 (a_2 \u2212 a_1) \u2212 s,   \u03b1_2 \u2261 (a_2 \u2212 a_1) + (1 \u2212 2 s)  (mod 1).\n  Writing \u03b4:=a_2\u2212a_1 (mod 1), we have \u03b1_1 \u2261 \u03b4 \u2212 s and \u03b1_2 \u2261 \u03b4 + (1 \u2212 2s) (mod 1).\n\nEnsuring incommensurability of \u03b1_1 and \u03b1_2\n- Choose s\u2208(0,1/2) and \u03b4\u2208(s,2s) so that both representatives in [0,1) satisfy \u03b1_1=\u03b4\u2212s\u2208(0,1) and \u03b1_2=\u03b4+(1\u22122s)\u2208(0,1) (the latter is equivalent to \u03b4<2s). Then \u03b1_1/\u03b1_2 is irrational for generic \u03b4. Indeed, for fixed s, the set of \u03b4 giving \u03b1_1/\u03b1_2\u2208Q is countable: solving (\u03b4\u2212s)/(\u03b4+1\u22122s)=p/q yields a single \u03b4 for each p/q. Hence we can pick \u03b4 outside this countable set.\n- Example with explicit numbers (numerics only to guide checking): Take s=\u221a2/10\u22480.141421, L_1=L_3=s, L_2=1\u22122s\u22480.717158. Pick \u03b4=0.241421 (which lies in (s,2s)). Then set a_1=0, a_2=\u03b4, and a_3 \u2261 1\u22123s+2\u03b4 (mod 1) \u2248 0.058578. This A supports both orders O1 and O2, giving \u03b1_1\u22480.100000 and \u03b1_2\u22480.958579. By the argument above, \u03b1_1/\u03b1_2 is irrational for generic \u03b4 (here \u03b4 is irrational), so we expect incommensurability; the exact rational obstruction would force \u03b4 to be a specific rational function of s and p/q, which it is not.\n\nIrreducibility of the constructed tilings (singleton case)\n- Claim: If K contains 0 and 1 and |T_n|=1 for all n, then the tiling T is irreducible. Reason: Suppose T=T_1\u2294T_2 yields a partition Z=X_1\u2294X_2 with A+T_i=X_i\u00d7S^1. If n\u2208X_1, then row n is covered by intervals coming from k=0 (index n) and k=1 (index n\u22121). Thus \u03b8_n,\u03b8_{n\u22121} must belong to T_1. Iterating forces all \u03b8_m into T_1, so T_2=\u2205. Thus no nontrivial splitting exists.\n- Therefore, both singleton tilings constructed from O1 and O2 are irreducible.\n\nNon-column property\n- Heuristic/likely sufficient condition: If the set of k-positions contains at least two distinct values and the lengths contain an irrational (e.g., take s irrational with L_1=L_3=s and L_2=1\u22122s), then A is not a column. Sketch: A column tiling A+T_col=X\u00d7S^1 with X finite forces, at each row n\u2208X, integer counts c_{i,n} satisfying \u2211_i c_{i,n}L_i=1. With L_i irrationally related to 1, this severely restricts the possible c_{i,n} (often forcing a unique pattern), and compatibility across rows (given that each translate contributes to several rows simultaneously) becomes impossible unless K has a single position. I will turn this into a fully rigorous lemma next round by formalizing the linear algebra and the \u201crow coupling\u201d constraint induced by K={0,1,2}. For concreteness in the example above, with s irrational, I claim A is not a column.\n\nWhy this matters here\n- The construction above gives a concrete, checkable candidate answering the main question in the affirmative: a non-column tile A that admits two different irreducible tilings T and T\u2032 with periods (1,\u03b1_1) and (1,\u03b1_2) such that \u03b1_1/\u03b1_2\u2209Q.\n- The argument isolates a minimal mechanism: two admissible cyclic orders yield two different \u03b1, and choosing lengths with a symmetry (L_1=L_3) synchronizes the order-compatibility congruences.\n\nWhat to verify explicitly (auditable checks)\n1) Fiber finiteness: At each n, check \u2211_i (#T_{n\u2212k_i})L_i=1 for singleton tilings (obvious here: the two/equivalently three intervals partition S^1). 2) For O1 and O2: compute the three interval endpoints at row n in terms of \u03b8_n and verify pairwise adjacencies:\n   - O1 yields [\u03b8_n+a_1, \u03b8_n+a_1+L_1], [\u03b8_{n\u22121}+a_2, \u03b8_{n\u22121}+a_2+L_2], [\u03b8_{n\u22122}+a_3, \u03b8_{n\u22122}+a_3+L_3], where with \u03b1_1 and the congruence a_1\u22122a_2+a_3\u22611\u22123s, one has\n     \u03b8_n+a_1+L_1 = \u03b8_{n\u22121}+a_2 = \u03b8_{n\u22122}+a_3+L_3 and \u03b8_{n\u22122}+a_3+L_3+L_2 = \u03b8_n+a_1+1.\n   - O2 similarly gives adjacencies in the order (1,3,2) using \u03b1_2.\n   These equalities are straightforward algebra using \u03b8_{n\u2212j} = \u03b8_n \u2212 j\u03b1 and the displayed formulas for \u03b1_1,\u03b1_2.\n3) Irreducibility: As above, closure under predecessors 0 and 1 forces trivial splitting.\n4) Incommensurability: For fixed irrational s and \u03b4\u2208(s,2s), \u03b1_1/\u03b1_2 is irrational for all but countably many \u03b4, so choose \u03b4 irrational (e.g., \u03b4=s+\u221a2/100) to ensure \u03b1_1/\u03b1_2\u2209Q.\n5) Non-column: To be completed rigorously; the intended proof will show for K={0,1,2} and s irrational that no finite X can satisfy the per-row linear constraints compatibly with the multirow effect of each translate.\n\nObstacles and corrections\n- Earlier (false) idea fixed: \u201c\u03b1 must be rational\u201d was based on misreading T_{r+k}=T_r+\u03b1 as T_r=T_r+\u03b1. The corrected view allows \u03b1 irrational, fitting the problem\u2019s aim.\n- The non-column proof needs to be written cleanly; I have a clear route (row-coupled integer equations with an irrational parameter) and will supply details next.\n\nNext steps\n- Write the formal proof that the concrete A with K={0,1,2}, L_1=L_3=s irrational, L_2=1\u22122s, and a_1,a_2,a_3 satisfying a_1\u22122a_2+a_3\u22611\u22123s, is not a column.\n- Generalize the \u201ctwo-order mechanism\u201d beyond K={0,1,2}: characterize when multiple cyclic orders are simultaneously admissible and list the resulting \u03b1 as Z-linear forms in L_i.\n- Explore whether more than two incommensurable periods can be realized by the same tile (e.g., three different orders), and whether singleton assumption can be relaxed while keeping irreducibility.\n"}, {"prover_id": "02", "progress_md": "Status and plan\n- I could not read output.md (not provided), so I proceed with a self-contained candidate construction and a few clean lemmas with proofs that can be verified directly.\n- Goal here: give an explicit non-column tile A that admits two different irreducible tilings T, T\u2032 of Z\u00d7S^1 with periods (1,\u03b1) and (1,\u03b1\u2032) such that \u03b1/\u03b1\u2032\u2209Q. Each claim below is small and testable.\n\nIdea: two-layer tile enforcing a constant phase increment\n- Use only two vertical layers k=0 and k=1. A translate of A centered at integer z contributes sets on rows z and z+1. If, on every row n, the union of the contributions from z=n and z=n\u22121 exactly partitions S^1, we get a tiling. If that partition forces \u03b8_n\u2212\u03b8_{n\u22121} to be a prescribed increment, we obtain a \u201chelical\u201d period (1,\u03b1).\n- We design the layers so that two different increments \u03b1 and \u03b1+1/2 both work. Choosing \u03b1 irrational ensures \u03b1/(\u03b1+1/2) is irrational.\n\nExplicit construction\n- Pick a finite union U\u2282S^1 of disjoint intervals with 0<|U|<1/2 (e.g., U=[0,0.2)\u222a[0.3,0.35)).\n- Define J_0 := U \u222a (U+1/2). Then J_0 is a finite union of intervals and has 1/2-periodicity: J_0+1/2 = J_0.\n- Fix \u03b1\u2208S^1\\Q (e.g., \u03b1=\u221a2/10 mod 1). Define J_1 := S^1 \\ (J_0+\u03b1). This is also a finite union of intervals.\n- Define the tile A := ({0}\u00d7J_0) \u222a ({1}\u00d7J_1).\n\nLemma 1 (Two periodic tilings exist)\nClaim. For the tile A above there exist tilings T_\u03b1 and T_{\u03b1+1/2} with periods (1,\u03b1) and (1,\u03b1+1/2), respectively.\nProof. For T_\u03b1, let T_\u03b1 := {(z, \u03b8_0+z\u03b1): z\u2208Z} for any \u03b8_0\u2208S^1. On row n, the two contributing translates are from z=n (layer 0) and z=n\u22121 (layer 1), giving sets (J_0+\u03b8_n) and (J_1+\u03b8_{n\u22121}), where \u03b8_n=\u03b8_0+n\u03b1. Since J_1=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1), we have J_1+\u03b8_{n\u22121}=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b8_{n\u22121}+\u03b1)=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b8_n). Thus these two sets are complementary (overlaps only at endpoints; measure zero), so every row is perfectly tiled. The set T_\u03b1 is invariant under (1,\u03b1), so T_\u03b1 has period (1,\u03b1).\nFor T_{\u03b1+1/2}, define T_{\u03b1+1/2} analogously with \u03b8'_n=\u03b8'_0+n(\u03b1+1/2). Using J_0+1/2=J_0, we get J_0+\u03b8'_n = J_0+(\u03b8'_{n\u22121}+\u03b1+1/2) = J_0+(\u03b8'_{n\u22121}+\u03b1). Hence J_1+\u03b8'_{n\u22121}=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b8'_n). So the same complement argument yields a tiling with period (1,\u03b1+1/2). \u220e\n\nLemma 2 (A is not a column)\nClaim. The tile A does not tile any finite set {n_1,\u2026,n_m}\u00d7S^1.\nProof. Any single translate of A contributes on exactly two adjacent rows. Suppose A+T_f={n_1,\u2026,n_m}\u00d7S^1 for finite T_f. Let n_max be the largest row in {n_1,\u2026,n_m}. In row n_max, coverage requires two contributions: one from layer 0 at z=n_max and one from layer 1 at z=n_max\u22121 (since neither J_0 nor J_1 alone has full measure). If z=n_max\u2208T_f, then that translate also covers row n_max+1 (outside the target), contradiction. If we try to avoid z=n_max by only using z=n_max\u22121, we still fail because J_1 alone has measure <1 and cannot cover the whole circle. Thus no finite T_f works. \u220e\n\nLemma 3 (Irreducibility)\nClaim. Every tiling of Z\u00d7S^1 by A of the form constructed in Lemma 1 is irreducible.\nProof. Suppose T splits as a disjoint union T_1\u2294T_2 with Z partitioned into X_1\u2294X_2 and A+T_i=X_i\u00d7S^1. If n\u2208X_1, then row n must be covered by contributions from z=n (layer 0) and z=n\u22121 (layer 1). Therefore (n,\u03b8_n) and (n\u22121,\u03b8_{n\u22121}) must both belong to T_1; otherwise A+T_1 would not cover row n. But then row n\u22121 uses (n\u22121,\u03b8_{n\u22121}) and (n\u22122,\u03b8_{n\u22122}), forcing (n\u22122,\u03b8_{n\u22122})\u2208T_1 as well. Inducting both directions shows T_1 contains all anchors, hence X_1=Z and T_2=\u2205, i.e., the tiling is irreducible. \u220e\n\nLemma 4 (Incommensurability)\nClaim. If \u03b1\u2209Q, then \u03b1/(\u03b1+1/2)\u2209Q.\nProof. If \u03b1/(\u03b1+1/2)=p/q\u2208Q, then \u03b1 = (p/q)(\u03b1+1/2), so \u03b1(1\u2212p/q)=p/(2q), hence \u03b1 = p/(2(q\u2212p))\u2208Q, contradiction. \u220e\n\nWhy this solves the posed existence question\n- The tile A is not a column (Lemma 2).\n- There are two different irreducible tilings T_\u03b1 and T_{\u03b1+1/2} (Lemma 1, Lemma 3), with periods (1,\u03b1) and (1,\u03b1+1/2). Picking \u03b1 irrational ensures the periods are incommensurable by Lemma 4.\n- Everything is explicit and verifiable. One concrete choice is: U=[0,0.2)\u222a[0.3,0.35), \u03b1=\u221a2/10 mod 1. Then J_0=U\u222a(U+1/2), J_1=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1), and A=({0}\u00d7J_0)\u222a({1}\u00d7J_1).\n\nFourier/quotient check (optional sanity)\n- For k=1, the quotient G/\u27e8(1,\u03b1)\u27e9\u2245S^1. In the quotient, A projects to J_0 \u2294 (J_1\u2212\u03b1). Our choice J_1=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1) is exactly the quotient tiling identity. The \u03b1\u2192\u03b1+1/2 case follows since J_0 is 1/2-periodic.\n\nObstacles and caveats\n- Endpoints produce at most measure-zero overlaps, allowed by the tiling definition. Choosing U with generic endpoints avoids any accidental positive-measure overlaps.\n\nNext steps for the verifier\n- Check the three lemmas directly for the explicit numeric example given above.\n- Optionally generalize: taking J_0 to be 1/q-periodic yields q distinct tilings with periods (1,\u03b1+j/q), j=0,\u2026,q\u22121. For any irrational \u03b1 and any j\u22600, \u03b1/(\u03b1+j/q) is irrational by the same algebra, giving many incommensurable options.\n\nGaps in output.md\n- Not applicable; output.md was not provided in this round. If earlier outputs assert nonexistence or require stronger irreducibility notions, we should align definitions. The above argument relies only on the stated tiling, column, and irreducibility definitions in task.md."}, {"prover_id": "03", "progress_md": "Status and files\n- I do not see an output.md in this round; hence I cannot check or critique any curated results. I proceed to extract structure, prove small lemmas, and propose a concrete candidate construction to test.\n\nSet-up: fiberization across the Z-coordinate\n- Write T \u2286 Z \u00d7 S^1 as fibers T_n := {\u03b8 \u2208 S^1 : (n,\u03b8) \u2208 T}.\n- For each m \u2208 Z, the a.e. disjoint covering condition is\n  \u2211_{i=1}^\u2113 \u2211_{\u03c6\u2208T_{m-k_i}} 1_{[a_i,b_i]}(\u00b7\u2212\u03c6) = 1  a.e. on S^1.\n  Equivalently, for each m the circle S^1 is a.e. partitioned by the intervals [a_i,b_i] translated by all \u03c6\u2208T_{m-k_i}.\n\nBasic necessary conditions\n- Finite fibers: For each n, T_n must be finite. Reason: in column m, the pieces are disjoint a.e.; the total measure equals \u2211_i |I_i|\u00b7|T_{m-k_i}| = 1; since |I_i|>0, |T_{m-k_i}| are bounded, hence finite.\n- Reducibility obstruction (gcd): Let K={k_1,\u2026,k_\u2113} and H:=\u27e8K\u2212K\u27e9\u2264Z. If H\u2260Z (i.e., gcd{k_i\u2212k_j}>1), then any tiling splits along residue classes mod H, hence is reducible by grouping classes. Thus any irreducible tiling requires gcd{k_i\u2212k_j}=1.\n\nIrreducibility lemma for \u201cone translate per fiber\u201d\n- Ansatz: suppose |T_n|=1 for all n, say T_n={\u03b8_n}. Then the covering of column m uses exactly one translate of [a_i,b_i] coming from \u03b8_{m\u2212k_i} for each i.\n- Claim: If gcd{k_i\u2212k_j}=1 then any such tiling is irreducible. Proof: Suppose Z=X_1\u2294X_2 and T=T_1\u2294T_2 produce A+T_i=X_i\u00d7S^1. If m\u2208X_1, then to cover S^1 at column m using only T_1 we must have m\u2212k_i\u2208X_1 for all i (since each of the \u2113 necessary pieces comes from a distinct index m\u2212k_i). Hence X_1 is closed under subtraction by each k_i. Now take any i,j. If m\u2208X_1 then m\u2212k_i\u2208X_1; if m+(k_j\u2212k_i)\u2209X_1 (i.e. in X_2), column m+(k_j\u2212k_i) to be covered by T_2 would require (m+(k_j\u2212k_i))\u2212k_j = m\u2212k_i \u2208 X_2, contradicting m\u2212k_i\u2208X_1. Thus X_1 is closed under addition by all differences k_j\u2212k_i, so X_1 is a union of cosets of H=\u27e8K\u2212K\u27e9=Z, hence X_1 is either \u2205 or Z. So the tiling is irreducible.\n\nOne-translate-per-fiber reduces to linear congruences\n- Suppose |T_n|=1 and write \u03b8_n=u+n\u03b2 (period (1,\u03b2)). Assume at each column the \u2113 intervals appear in a fixed cyclic order \u03c3 on {1,\u2026,\u2113}. The adjacency condition along the circle is, for each i,\n  \u03b8_{m\u2212k_{\u03c3(i)}} + a_{\u03c3(i)} \u2261 \u03b8_{m\u2212k_i} + a_i + c_i (mod 1),\n  with c_i = b_i\u2212a_i. Eliminating m gives the family of congruences\n  (k_i\u2212k_{\u03c3(i)}) \u03b2 \u2261 a_i + c_i \u2212 a_{\u03c3(i)} (mod 1),  i=1,\u2026,\u2113.\n  Summing these yields an identity (since \u2211 c_i=1\u22610 in S^1), so there are \u2113\u22121 independent constraints.\n\nTwo tilings from one tile when \u2113=3 and K={0,1,2}\n- Take \u2113=3 with offsets (k_1,k_2,k_3)=(0,1,2); lengths c_1,c_2,c_3>0, c_1+c_2+c_3=1.\n- Consider two cyclic orders: \u03c3=(1\u21922\u21923\u21921) and \u03c3'=(1\u21923\u21922\u21921) (reverse).\n- Solving the congruences shows a compatibility criterion and a relation between the two period slopes:\n  \u2022 The two orders are simultaneously compatible for the same endpoints a_i iff c_1=c_3.\n  \u2022 When c_1=c_3, if the first tiling has slope \u03b2 (so T has period (1,\u03b1) with \u03b1=\u03b2), then the reversed-order tiling exists for the same tile A with slope \u03b2' \u2261 \u03b2 \u2212 c_1 (mod 1) (hence period (1,\u03b1') with \u03b1'=\u03b2').\n  Sketch: Write the \u03c3-congruences as \u2212\u03b2 \u2261 a_1+c_1\u2212a_2, \u2212\u03b2 \u2261 a_2+c_2\u2212a_3, 2\u03b2 \u2261 a_3+c_3\u2212a_1. From these define a_2,a_3 in terms of a_1,\u03b2,c\u2019s. The \u03c3'-congruences become \u22122\u03b2' \u2261 a_1+c_1\u2212a_3, \u03b2' \u2261 a_2+c_2\u2212a_1, \u03b2' \u2261 a_3+c_3\u2212a_2. Substituting a_2,a_3 from \u03c3, the three congruences are consistent iff c_1=c_3, and then force \u03b2' \u2261 \u03b2 \u2212 c_1 (mod 1).\n\nNon-column property\n- Claim: The above A (with one interval in each of the three columns 0,1,2, with lengths c_1,c_2,c_3 and c_1=c_3\u2260c_2) is not a column. Reason: If A tiled {n_1,n_2,n_3}\u00d7S^1 by a set \u0398\u2282S^1 of vertical shifts only, then in particular the column with length c_2 would be tiled by |\u0398| disjoint copies of an interval of length c_2, forcing |\u0398|\u00b7c_2=1. The columns with length c_1 satisfy |\u0398|\u00b7c_1=1 as well. These equalities imply c_1=c_2, contrary to c_2=1\u22122c_1 (unless c_1=c_2=1/3, which we avoid by choosing c_1\u22601/3). More generally, a single finite \u0398 cannot tile S^1 simultaneously by disjoint copies of two different lengths with total measure 1 in each column.\n\nIncommensurable periods via a concrete choice\n- Choose c_1=c_3=2/5, c_2=1\u22122c_1=1/5. Pick any irrational \u03b2\u2208(0,1) (e.g., \u03b2=\u221a2/4). Set a_1 arbitrarily (say 0), and define\n  a_2 \u2261 a_1 + c_1 \u2212 (k_1\u2212k_2)\u03b2 = c_1 + \u03b2,\n  a_3 \u2261 a_2 + c_2 \u2212 (k_2\u2212k_3)\u03b2 = c_1 + c_2 + 2\u03b2,\n  all modulo 1. This fixes the tile A.\n- Then:\n  \u2022 T = {(n, u+n\u03b2): n\u2208Z} is an irreducible tiling with period (1,\u03b1) where \u03b1=\u03b2, using cyclic order 1\u21922\u21923\u21921.\n  \u2022 T' = {(n, u'+n\u03b2'): n\u2208Z} with \u03b2'\u2261\u03b2\u2212c_1 (mod 1) is an irreducible tiling with period (1,\u03b1') where \u03b1'=\u03b2', using cyclic order 1\u21923\u21922\u21921.\n- Incommensurability: Since c_1=2/5 is rational and \u03b2 is irrational, the ratio \u03b1/\u03b1' is irrational. Indeed, if \u03b1/\u03b1'\u2208Q, then \u03b1 = r \u03b1' for some rational r; but \u03b1'\u2261\u03b1\u2212c_1 (or \u03b1'\u2261\u03b1+1\u2212c_1 depending on the representative in [0,1)), yielding \u03b1 = r(\u03b1\u00b1(1\u2212c_1)), so \u03b1 is rational\u2014contradiction. A short algebraic check: \u03b1/(\u03b1\u2212c_1)=p/q \u21d2 \u03b1 = (p c_1)/(q\u2212p) \u2208 Q.\n\nWorked numeric instance (sanity check)\n- Take \u03b2=\u221a2/4\u22480.353553, c_1=c_3=0.4, c_2=0.2, a_1=0.\n  Then a_2\u22480.753553, a_3\u22480.307106. Forward tiling at column m=0 uses the three arcs [0,0.4], [0.4,0.6], [0.6,1] (disjoint cover). The reversed tiling uses \u03b2'\u2261\u03b2\u22120.4\u22610.953553; at m=0 the arcs are [0,0.4], [0.4,0.8], [0.8,1] (disjoint cover). Both tilings are irreducible by the lemma. The ratio \u03b1/\u03b1'\u22480.37\u2026 is irrational by the argument above.\n\nWhy useful here\n- This furnishes a concrete family of tiles A (not columns) with two different irreducible periodic tilings whose vertical periods are incommensurable. It suggests a positive resolution to the existence question.\n\nOpen checks and potential gaps to verify rigorously\n- Endpoints are measured-zero; ensure no overlaps except at endpoints\u2014true by construction since adjacencies are exact.\n- The non-column argument: formalize that a common finite \u0398 cannot simultaneously partition the circle with two different interval lengths summing to 1. The counting |\u0398|\u00b7c=1 for each column is immediate from disjointness; equality for two different c\u2019s forces equality of lengths. This can be stated and proved succinctly.\n- Irreducibility lemma is proved for the 1-per-fiber case; this covers our construction. A verifier may want to write it as a formal implication: m\u2208X_1 \u21d2 m\u2212k_i\u2208X_1 for all i; then show closure under additions of differences using the complement X_2 and the covering requirement.\n\nIdeas for generalization and next steps\n- Formalize and record in output.md: (1) gcd-necessity lemma; (2) one-translate-per-fiber congruence system; (3) irreducibility lemma for one-translate-per-fiber; (4) the \u2113=3, K={0,1,2}, c_1=c_3 construction giving two tilings with \u03b2'\u2261\u03b2\u2212c_1; (5) non-column criterion.\n- Explore whether other pairs of permutations \u03c3,\u03c3' give different linear relations among \u03b2,\u03b2' for broader families (possibly yielding richer parameter sets or more than two tilings).\n- Fourier viewpoint: For completeness, note that for general tilings (not necessarily |T_n|=1), the nonzero Fourier modes satisfy linear recurrences whose characteristic equation involves the coefficients sin(\u03c0 t c_i)/(\u03c0 t) and can constrain possible periods. Recording this could help classify when multiple periodic tilings exist.\n"}]
