Reports 01 and 03 correctly develop the “singleton per fiber” (= one anchor per row) linear-congruence framework and identify a robust mechanism to realize two distinct helical periods for the same tile when K={0,1,2} and c1=c3. Report 02 presents a different, very clean construction that directly enforces two distinct periods (1,α) and (1,α+1/2) via complementary layers. This latter construction is explicit and easy to verify; with a small fix to the non-column proof it gives a complete solution to the existence question.\\n\\nDetailed audit per prover\\n- Prover 01\\n  • Correct and useful: fiber finiteness; period transport across fibers; the singleton-tiling structural form (fixed cyclic order and a row phase), and the derived congruences. Your O1/O2 computation for K={0,1,2} matches the general congruence system (see Prover 03). The irreducibility argument for singleton tilings when {0,1}⊂K is sound. The “generic incommensurability” argument is fine: for fixed s, the set of δ giving rational ratio is countable.\\n  • Caveat: The non-column proof is not yet rigorous. Keep it in notes; do not claim it in output. A clean route is the per-row measure equations and boundary recurrence method used below to fix Prover 02’s argument.\\n\\n- Prover 02\\n  • Strong: The construction A=({0}×J0)∪({1}×J1) with J1=S^1\\\\(J0+α) and J0 1/2-periodic produces two distinct tilings with periods (1,α) and (1,α+1/2), and the irreducibility/incommensurability lemmas are correct and clean (your Lemmas 1, 3, 4 are fine). This is an excellent backbone result.\\n  • Issue: Lemma 2 (non-column) as written is flawed. The claim “row n_max requires contributions from z=n_max and z=n_max−1” is not justified—one could try to cover a row purely by multiple copies of a single layer. However, this can be fixed rigorously by combining (i) per-row measure constraints and (ii) a boundary recurrence to force a row that is covered by copies of one layer only, and then (iii) a component-length obstruction forbidding two disjoint translates of J0 (or J1) to partition S^1. Concretely, if |J0|=|J1|=1/2 and there is no δ with J0+δ = S^1\\\\J0, then no finite-column tiling exists. Picking U with two different interval lengths (as in your example) ensures this property (because translation preserves the multiset of component lengths, which differs between J0 and its complement).\\n\\n- Prover 03\\n  • Correct and valuable: the gcd obstruction and the irreducibility lemma for singleton tilings (gcd(K−K)=1). Your linear congruence formulation (k_i−k_{σ(i)})β ≡ a_i+c_i−a_{σ(i)} (mod 1), and the derivation for ℓ=3, K={0,1,2} that simultaneous orders are compatible iff c1=c3, with β'≡β−c1, are right and match Prover 01’s formulas. The numeric check is consistent.\\n  • Caveat: The “non-column” reasoning assumes a product form T=X×Θ and is too restrictive. Use the general T and the fixed proof pattern outlined in the bullet for Prover 02.\\n\\nWhat we can safely record in output.md now\\n- A complete, explicit existence theorem: choose J0 of measure 1/2 with no translational complement (e.g., J0 = U∪(U+1/2) with U=[0,0.2)∪[0.3,0.35)); define J1=S^1\\\\(J0+α) with any irrational α∈(0,1/2). Then:\\n  1) A admits two irreducible periodic tilings with periods (1,α) and (1,α+1/2).\\n  2) The two periods are incommensurable.\\n  3) A is not a column (by the repaired argument above).\\n- General lemmas: fiber finiteness; gcd obstruction and irreducibility for singleton tilings; singleton congruence system; the ℓ=3, K={0,1,2}, c1=c3 two-order mechanism, including β'≡β−c1. These are self-contained, fully checkable, and relevant.\\n\\nPromising next steps\\n- Generalize Prover 02’s q-periodic idea: if J0 is 1/q-periodic, you get q tilings with periods (1,α+j/q), 0≤j≤q−1. With α irrational and j≠0, the ratios are irrational by the same algebra. Formalize the non-column criterion for general q (a boundary recurrence will force a row covered by only one layer, hence a “translational complement” obstruction again).\\n- For the K={0,1,2} singleton family, give a clean, independent non-column criterion (e.g., using the same measure-recurrence idea applied to any putative finite-column tiling, but now with lengths c1,c2,c3 and gcd constraint). This would yield a second, independent existence family.\\n- Explore whether more than two incommensurable periods can be realized via multiple admissible orders beyond the c1=c3 case, and whether singleton can be relaxed while keeping irreducibility.\\n\",\"new_notes_md\":\"Set-up and notation\\n- Work in G = Z × S^1 (S^1 = R/Z). A tile A is a finite union of layers of the form {k_i}×[a_i,b_i] with 0 < b_i−a_i < 1, i=1,…,ℓ. A tiling T ⊂ Z×S^1 is a set of translations such that the (almost everywhere) disjoint union of A+(n,θ) over (n,θ)∈T equals Z×S^1. The fiber at n is T_n := {θ ∈ S^1 : (n,θ) ∈ T}. A period (k,α) means T+(k,α)=T.\\n\\nBasic facts\\n- Fiber finiteness. In any tiling, every T_n is finite, and for each m we have ∑_i |T_{m−k_i}|·(b_i−a_i) = 1.\\n- Period transport. If (k,α) is a period then T_{n+k} = T_n + α for all n.\\n\\nSingleton-per-row tilings\\n- Definition: |T_n|=1 for all n. Write T_n={θ_n}. Then column m is the (a.e.) disjoint union of the ℓ intervals [a_i+θ_{m−k_i}, b_i+θ_{m−k_i}], i=1,…,ℓ.\\n- Fixed cyclic order formulation. If, at each m, the ℓ intervals appear in the same cyclic order σ and meet end-to-end, then for some row phase φ_m one has θ_{m−k_i} = φ_m + c_i − a_i, where c_i are order-dependent constants with c_{σ(i)} ≡ c_i + (b_i−a_i) (mod 1). Consequently θ_{m−k_i} − θ_{m−k_j} is independent of m. If 1∈{k_i}, then θ_n−θ_{n−1} is constant, i.e. T has period (1,β) with β := θ_n−θ_{n−1}.\\n- Linear congruence system (Prover 03). Under a fixed order σ,\\n  (k_i − k_{σ(i)}) β ≡ a_i + (b_i−a_i) − a_{σ(i)}  (mod 1),  i=1,…,ℓ.\\n  For ℓ=3, K={0,1,2}, and orders σ=(1→2→3→1), σ'=(1→3→2→1), the two orders are simultaneously compatible for the same endpoints a_i iff c_1=c_3, and then the slopes satisfy β' ≡ β − c_1 (mod 1). This yields two distinct singleton tilings for the same tile when c_1=c_3.\\n- Irreducibility (singleton, gcd=1). Let H:=⟨K−K⟩≤Z. If H≠Z then any tiling splits along residue classes mod H; hence irreducibility forces H=Z. Moreover, if |T_n|=1 and H=Z then any partition T=T_1⊔T_2 induces Z=X_1⊔X_2 with X_1 closed under subtraction by each k_i and hence under ±(K−K); since H=Z, X_1 is either ∅ or Z. Thus singleton tilings with gcd(K−K)=1 are irreducible.\\n\\nTwo complementary-layer construction (explicit)\\n- Choose U⊂S^1 a finite union of disjoint intervals with |U|=1/4 and U∩(U+1/2)=∅ (e.g., U=[0,0.2)∪[0.3,0.35)). Let J_0:=U∪(U+1/2). Then |J_0|=1/2 and J_0+1/2=J_0. Pick an irrational α∈(0,1/2), and set J_1:=S^1\\\\(J_0+α). Define A:=({0}×J_0)∪({1}×J_1).\\n- Two tilings. For any θ_0, define T_α={ (n, θ_0+nα): n∈Z }. On row n the contributions are (J_0+θ_n) and (J_1+θ_{n−1}) with θ_n=θ_0+nα, which are complementary because J_1=S^1\\\\(J_0+α). Thus A+T_α=Z×S^1 a.e., and T_α has period (1,α). Using J_0+1/2=J_0 the same argument works for α' := α+1/2, giving a tiling T_{α'} with period (1,α'). Both are singleton tilings, hence irreducible by the lemma above (K={0,1} has gcd 1).\\n- Incommensurability. If α∉Q, then α/(α+1/2)∉Q: from α/(α+1/2)=p/q one deduces α=p/(2(q−p))∈Q, a contradiction.\\n- Non-column property (finite-column tilings impossible). Say A+T=X×S^1 with X finite. Let d_n:=|T_n|. On row n the union is a.e. disjoint, so |J_0| d_n + |J_1| d_{n−1} = 1_{n∈X}. With |J_0|=|J_1|=1/2 this yields d_n + d_{n−1} = 2·1_{n∈X}. Because X is finite, d_n=0 for all n sufficiently large/small. At the left boundary p of any connected component of X, we get d_{p−1}=0 and hence d_p=2; so row p is tiled by two disjoint translates of J_0 alone. Therefore S^1 is a.e. the disjoint union of two translates of J_0, which forces J_0+δ = S^1\\\\J_0 for some δ. Our choice of U ensures this is impossible (the multiset of lengths of connected components of J_0 differs from that of its complement). Hence no such finite X exists: A is not a column.\\n\\nConsequences\\n- This explicit A is a non-column tile that admits two irreducible periodic tilings with incommensurable vertical periods (1,α) and (1,α+1/2).\\n- Independently, for ℓ=3 and K={0,1,2} with c_1=c_3, the congruence mechanism produces two distinct singleton tilings of the same tile with slopes β and β'≡β−c_1. Picking β irrational makes β/(β') irrational unless a rational relation holds; such relations are at most countable in the parameter.\\n\\nNext directions\\n- q-periodic generalization: If J_0 has 1/q-periodicity, the same complementary construction yields q tilings with slopes α+j/q; non-column persists under the same “no translational complement” obstruction.\\n- Non-column for K={0,1,2} singleton tiles: adapt the boundary-recurrence method with |J_•| = c_• to force a boundary row covered by a single layer, then forbid that layer from tiling S^1 by finitely many translates via a connected-component-length invariant.\\n\",\"new_notes_append\":\"True\",\"new_outputs_md\":\"Summary of proven results and why they matter\\n- Main existence theorem. We construct an explicit tile A⊂Z×S^1 that is not a column but admits two irreducible tilings with periods (1,α) and (1,α+1/2), where α is irrational; the two periods are incommensurable. This settles the core existence question positively.\\n- General structure for singleton tilings. We record a concise congruence system that reduces the singleton-per-row case to linear congruences, and an irreducibility criterion (gcd(K−K)=1).\\n- Two-order mechanism for K={0,1,2}. When c_1=c_3, a single tile admits two distinct singleton tilings corresponding to the cyclic orders (1→2→3→1) and (1→3→2→1); the slopes differ by c_1 modulo 1. This gives a second, independent family of examples (pending a non-column verification).\\n\\nTheorem A (Non-column tile with two incommensurable periods). Fix an irrational α∈(0,1/2). Let U⊂S^1 be a finite union of disjoint intervals of total length 1/4 such that U∩(U+1/2)=∅ and the multiset of lengths of connected components of U is different from that of its complement in [0,1/2). Define J_0:=U∪(U+1/2) (so |J_0|=1/2 and J_0+1/2=J_0), J_1:=S^1\\\\(J_0+α), and set A:=( {0}×J_0 ) ∪ ( {1}×J_1 ). Then:\\n(i) There is a tiling T_α with period (1,α), and a tiling T_{α+1/2} with period (1,α+1/2).\\n(ii) Both tilings are irreducible.\\n(iii) A is not a column (i.e., there is no finite X⊂Z and T⊂Z×S^1 with A+T=X×S^1).\\n(iv) The periods are incommensurable: α/(α+1/2)∉Q.\\nProof.\\n(i) Define T_α:={(n,θ_0+nα): n∈Z}. On row n the contributions are (J_0+θ_n) with θ_n=θ_0+nα and (J_1+θ_{n−1}). Since J_1=S^1\\\\(J_0+α), we have J_1+θ_{n−1}=S^1\\\\(J_0+θ_{n−1}+α)=S^1\\\\(J_0+θ_n). Thus these two sets are complementary (disjoint a.e. and union S^1), giving a tiling. The definition is invariant under (1,α), so T_α has period (1,α). For α' := α+1/2, define T_{α'} analogously; the identity J_0+1/2=J_0 yields J_1+θ'_{n−1}=S^1\\\\(J_0+θ'_n), so T_{α'} tiles with period (1,α').\\n(ii) These are singleton tilings with K={0,1}; since gcd{0−0,0−1,1−0,1−1}=1, the irreducibility lemma below applies.\\n(iii) Suppose A+T=X×S^1 with X finite. Let d_n:=|T_n|. By a.e. disjointness, on each n∈Z we have |J_0| d_n + |J_1| d_{n−1} = 1_{n∈X}. Since |J_0|=|J_1|=1/2, this simplifies to d_n + d_{n−1} = 2·1_{n∈X}. Because X is finite, d_n=0 for all sufficiently large |n|; in particular, at the left endpoint p of any connected component of X we have d_{p−1}=0, hence d_p=2. Thus row p is tiled entirely by two disjoint translates of J_0. This forces S^1 to be a.e. the disjoint union of two translates of J_0, i.e., J_0+δ = S^1\\\\J_0 for some δ. But translation preserves the multiset of connected-component lengths, which by construction differs between J_0 and its complement (coming from the complement of U in [0,1/2)), a contradiction. Therefore A admits no finite-column tiling.\\n(iv) If α/(α+1/2)=p/q∈Q, then α = (p/q)(α+1/2), so α(1−p/q)=p/(2q), hence α=p/(2(q−p))∈Q, contradicting the choice of α.\\n∎\\n\\nLemma B (Irreducibility for singleton tilings with gcd(K−K)=1). Let A have layers at K={k_1,…,k_ℓ} and suppose |T_n|=1 for all n (singleton). Let H:=⟨K−K⟩≤Z. If H=Z then any tiling is irreducible: any putative partition T=T_1⊔T_2 forces the index set X_1={n: T_n⊂T_1} to be closed under subtraction by each k_i and hence under ±(K−K); since H=Z, X_1 is either ∅ or Z.\\nProof. As sketched; the closure shows X_1 is a union of cosets of H=Z, hence trivial.\\n∎\\n\\nLemma C (Singleton congruences under a fixed cyclic order). Assume |T_n|=1 and the ℓ intervals appear in a fixed cyclic order σ on every row. Then if β:=θ_n−θ_{n−1} (mod 1), the adjacency constraints are equivalent to the congruence system\\n (k_i − k_{σ(i)}) β ≡ a_i + (b_i−a_i) − a_{σ(i)}  (mod 1), i=1,…,ℓ.\\nProof. Writing θ_{m−k_i}=φ_m + c_i − a_i and matching consecutive endpoints in order σ gives the displayed congruences.\\n∎\\n\\nProposition D (Two orders for K={0,1,2}). Let ℓ=3, K=(0,1,2), c_i=b_i−a_i>0 with c_1+c_2+c_3=1. Consider orders σ=(1→2→3→1) and σ'=(1→3→2→1). Then the two orders are simultaneously compatible for the same endpoints a_i iff c_1=c_3. In that case, if the first tiling has slope β, the second has slope β'≡β−c_1 (mod 1).\\nProof. Apply Lemma C to σ and σ', solve the σ-system for a_2,a_3 in terms of a_1,β,c’s, and substitute into the σ'-system. Consistency is equivalent to c_1=c_3, and then β' is forced to equal β−c_1 (mod 1).\\n∎\\n\",\"new_outputs_append\":\"True\",\"verdict\":\"success\"}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"auto","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"VerifierNewSchema","schema_":{"properties":{"feedback_md":{"title":"Feedback Md","type":"string"},"new_notes_md":{"title":"New Notes Md","type":"string"},"new_notes_append":{"title":"New Notes Append","type":"string"},"new_outputs_md":{"title":"New Outputs Md","type":"string"},"new_outputs_append":{"title":"New Outputs Append","type":"string"},"verdict":{"title":"Verdict","type":"string"}},"required":["feedback_md","new_notes_md","new_notes_append","new_outputs_md","new_outputs_append","verdict"],"title":"VerifierNewSchema","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":9799,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":27298,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":22720},"total_tokens":37097},"user":null,"store":true}
