High-level assessment: All three reports make real progress. Reports 01 and 03 correctly develop the “singleton per fiber” (= one anchor per row) linear-congruence framework and identify a robust mechanism to realize two distinct helical periods for the same tile when K={0,1,2} and c1=c3. Report 02 presents a different, very clean construction that directly enforces two distinct periods (1,α) and (1,α+1/2) via complementary layers. This latter construction is explicit and easy to verify; with a small fix to the non-column proof it gives a complete solution to the existence question.
