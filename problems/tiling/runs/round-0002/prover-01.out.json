The tiling constructions (periods (1,\u03b1) and (1,\u03b1+1/2)), irreducibility (singleton with K={0,1}), and incommensurability are all sound.\n- Minor simplification available: the non-column step for Theorem A can be made even simpler if we do not insist that |J_0|=1/2. The same two tilings work for any J_0 with 1/2-periodicity; if we pick |J_0|\u2209{1/m: m\u2208N}, then the boundary recurrence forces an integer contradiction immediately (details below). The current proof keeps |J_0|=1/2 and uses the component-length obstruction to rule out the special case d_p=2; both approaches are fine, but the \u201cnon-1/m\u201d route is simpler to state and verify.\n- Proposition D (K={0,1,2}, two orders when c_1=c_3) is correct; the proof sketch via Lemma C is standard. The output currently labels this family as \u201cpending a non-column verification.\u201d I supply below a clean, short non-column criterion that completes this second family under very mild numerical assumptions (in particular, it works for the concrete examples already suggested).\n\nLemma E (non-column for K={0,1,2} with one interval per layer)\n- Statement. Let A have layers at K=(0,1,2) with lengths c_1,c_2,c_3>0, c_1+c_2+c_3=1. If A tiles a finite set X\u00d7S^1, set d_n:=|T_n|. Then necessarily 1/c_1 and 1/c_3 are (nonnegative) integers. In particular, if either c_1 or c_3 is not the reciprocal of an integer, then A is not a column.\n- Proof. The per-row measure identities are\n  c_1 d_n + c_2 d_{n-1} + c_3 d_{n-2} = 1_{n\u2208X},  for all n\u2208Z.\n  Let p:=min X. For n=p\u22122, the right-hand side is 0, all coefficients are positive, hence d_{p\u22122}=d_{p\u22123}=d_{p\u22124}=0. For n=p\u22121, we get c_1 d_{p\u22121}=0, so d_{p\u22121}=0. For n=p, 1=c_1 d_p, so d_p=1/c_1\u2208N. A symmetric argument at the right boundary q:=max X gives d_{q\u22122}=1/c_3\u2208N. This proves the claim. \u220e\n- Consequence for the \u201ctwo-order\u201d family: If we impose c_1=c_3=s and choose s not of the form 1/m (e.g., s=2/5 as in the worked example, or any irrational in (0,1/2)), then A cannot be a column. Combined with Proposition D and the singleton irreducibility criterion, this completes a second explicit family of examples with two irreducible periodic tilings and incommensurable periods (\u03b2 and \u03b2\u2212s).\n\nLemma F (simpler non-column for the complementary 2-layer construction)\n- Setting: Same as Theorem A except we do not fix |J_0|=1/2; still assume J_0+1/2=J_0 and J_1:=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1).\n- Claim. If |J_0|\u2209{1/m: m\u2208N}, then A is not a column.\n- Proof. The per-row measures are |J_0| d_n + (1\u2212|J_0|) d_{n\u22121} = 1_{n\u2208X}. Let p:=min X. For n=p\u22121, 0=|J_0| d_{p\u22121}+(1\u2212|J_0|) d_{p\u22122} forces d_{p\u22121}=d_{p\u22122}=0. For n=p, 1=|J_0| d_p, so d_p=1/|J_0|\u2208N. Contradiction unless |J_0|=1/m. \u220e\n- Remark. This shows the component-length hypothesis in Theorem A is only needed in the special endpoint case |J_0|=1/2 (when the boundary recurrence yields d_p=2). Keeping |J_0|=1/2 is perfectly fine (current output), but the theorem can be simplified by picking |U| so that |J_0|\u22601/2 and |J_0| is not a reciprocal of an integer; then the non-column conclusion is immediate from the boundary equations.\n\nProposition G (q-phase generalization of the 2-layer construction)\n- Statement. Fix q\u22652. Suppose J_0\u2282S^1 is 1/q-periodic (J_0+1/q=J_0). For any irrational \u03b1, define J_1:=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1) and A:=( {0}\u00d7J_0 )\u222a( {1}\u00d7J_1 ). Then for each j=0,1,\u2026,q\u22121 there is a singleton tiling T_{\u03b1+j/q} with period (1,\u03b1+j/q). If j\u2260j\u2032, the periods (1,\u03b1+j/q) and (1,\u03b1+j\u2032/q) are incommensurable. If moreover |J_0|\u2209{1/m: m\u2208N}, then A is not a column.\n- Proof. Define T_{\u03b1+j/q}:={(n,\u03b8_0+n(\u03b1+j/q))}. On row n, contributions are (J_0+\u03b8_n) and (J_1+\u03b8_{n\u22121}). Since J_0+1/q=J_0, J_0+\u03b8_n=J_0+(\u03b8_{n\u22121}+\u03b1+j/q)=J_0+(\u03b8_{n\u22121}+\u03b1); hence J_1+\u03b8_{n\u22121} is the complement of J_0+\u03b8_n, so we have a tiling with period (1,\u03b1+j/q). If (\u03b1+j/q)/(\u03b1+j\u2032/q)\u2208Q with j\u2260j\u2032, rearranging gives \u03b1 as a rational number, contradiction; thus the periods are incommensurable. The non-column condition follows as in Lemma F. \u220e\n\nConcrete check for the K={0,1,2} family (completing the second mechanism)\n- Parameters: c_1=c_3=2/5, c_2=1/5; pick \u03b2 irrational (e.g., \u03b2=\u221a2/10), set a_1=0, and define a_2\u2261a_1+c_1+\u03b2, a_3\u2261a_2+c_2+\u03b2 (mod 1). Then:\n  \u2022 Order \u03c3=(1\u21922\u21923\u21921) produces a tiling with slope \u03b2.\n  \u2022 Order \u03c3\u2032=(1\u21923\u21922\u21921) produces a tiling with slope \u03b2\u2032\u2261\u03b2\u2212c_1 (mod 1).\n  \u2022 By Lemma E, A is not a column because 1/c_1=5/2\u2209N.\n  \u2022 \u03b2/(\u03b2\u2032) is irrational since \u03b2/(\u03b2\u2212c_1)\u2208Q \u21d2 \u03b2\u2208Q (with c_1 rational), a contradiction.\n  \u2022 Irreducibility follows from the singleton irreducibility lemma (H=\u27e8K\u2212K\u27e9=Z).\n\nWhy useful here\n- Lemma E fills the \u201cpending non-column\u201d gap for the K={0,1,2} two-order family under a very mild numerical requirement (e.g., c_1=c_3 not a reciprocal of an integer), thus upgrading that mechanism to a complete existence scheme.\n- Lemma F and Proposition G streamline and extend Theorem A: they show the complementary 2-layer construction yields q distinct incommensurable periods, and provide a simpler non-column criterion.\n\nObstacles and cautions\n- Endpoints: All uses of measure additivity rely on a.e. disjointness; overlaps can occur at finitely many endpoints only, hence measure zero\u2014consistent with the tiling definition.\n- For Theorem A as stated (|J_0|=1/2), the \u201ccomponent-length\u201d obstruction should specify that translation preserves the multiset of component lengths, while (S^1\\J_0) inheres the multiset from the complement of U in [0,1/2); the difference is guaranteed by the hypothesis on U. This is correct as written, but the simpler alternative via Lemma F avoids this case distinction entirely.\n\nNext steps (suggested updates to output.md)\n- Add Lemma E to complete the K={0,1,2} mechanism as a second explicit family of examples.\n- Optionally, rephrase Theorem A to allow arbitrary |J_0| (with 1/2-periodicity) and replace the non-column hypothesis by \u201c|J_0|\u2209{1/m: m\u2208N},\u201d or keep the current |J_0|=1/2 statement and append Lemma F as a remark.\n- Record Proposition G (q-phase generalization) with its incommensurability claim; this shows one tile can admit multiple (\u22652) pairwise incommensurable periods simultaneously.\n"
