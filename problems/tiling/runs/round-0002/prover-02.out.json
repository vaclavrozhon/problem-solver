  "progress_md": "Ideas and audit of current output\n- Theorem A, Lemma B, Lemma C, and Proposition D in output.md are coherent and substantially correct for the goals of the task. In particular, the complementary-layer construction A = ({0}\u00d7J_0) \u222a ({1}\u00d7J_1) with J_1 := S^1 \\ (J_0+\u03b1) yields two singleton tilings with periods (1,\u03b1) and (1,\u03b1+1/2) whenever J_0 has 1/2-periodicity, and the irreducibility/incommensurability parts are sound.\n- Non-column proof in Theorem A is now valid: the per-row measure equation with |J_0|=|J_1|=1/2 implies a boundary row is covered by exactly two translates of J_0; since the two are a.e. disjoint and cover S^1, one must be (a.e.) the complement of the other, i.e., J_0+\u03b4 = S^1\\J_0. The \u201ccomponent-length multiset\u201d obstruction to such a \u03b4 is correct. That said, the 1/2 hypothesis on |J_0| is stronger than needed; see Lemma 1 below for a simpler, more general non-column criterion.\n- Proposition D (two orders for K={0,1,2}) would benefit from one explicit algebra check; I include it below (short calculation) for easy verification.\n\nNew lemmas and refinements (small, checkable steps)\n1) General boundary obstruction to columnity (useful: quick test A is not a column). Let A be any tile and write K={k_i} and c_i=b_i\u2212a_i. Set k_min:=min_i k_i and \u03bc_min:=\u2211_{i: k_i=k_min} c_i. If A+T = X\u00d7S^1 with X finite (i.e., A is a column), let p:=min X and d_z:=|T_z|. Then necessarily d_{p\u2212k_min}\u00b7\u03bc_min = 1, hence 1/\u03bc_min\u2208N. Proof: Since p is the minimal covered row, no translate with anchor z<p\u2212k_min can appear (it would cover a row <p). Any translate anchored at z=p\u2212k with k>k_min would also cover the row z+k_min = p\u2212(k\u2212k_min)<p, contradicting minimality. Thus row p is covered solely by the d_{p\u2212k_min} copies of the k_min-layer, a.e. disjoint; the measure identity gives d_{p\u2212k_min} \u03bc_min=1. In particular, if 1/\u03bc_min\u2209N then A is not a column.\n- Consequence for Theorem A and beyond: For K={0,1}, \u03bc_min=|J_0|. Thus if |J_0| is irrational (or not the reciprocal of an integer), A cannot be a column. This removes the need for the \u201ccomponent-length\u201d obstruction and simplifies the non-column proof greatly. It also applies verbatim to the K={0,1,2} singleton family; e.g., if c_1 (the length at k=0) is 2/5, then 1/c_1 is not an integer, so that tile cannot be a column.\n\n2) q-periodic amplification (useful: many different periods for the same A). Let J_0\u2282S^1 be 1/q-periodic, i.e. J_0+1/q=J_0, and set J_1:=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1). Define A:=( {0}\u00d7J_0 ) \u222a ( {1}\u00d7J_1 ). Then for every j=0,1,\u2026,q\u22121 the set T^{(j)}={ (n, \u03b8_0 + n(\u03b1 + j/q)) : n\u2208Z } is a singleton tiling with period (1, \u03b1 + j/q). Proof: On row n, J_0+\u03b8^{(j)}_n and J_1+\u03b8^{(j)}_{n\u22121} are complementary since J_1=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1) and J_0+1/q=J_0. Disjointness a.e. holds by construction. Irreducibility holds by Lemma B (singleton, K={0,1}). For \u03b1 irrational and any j\u2260j\u2032, incommensurability is automatic: if (\u03b1+j/q)/(\u03b1+j\u2032/q)\u2208Q then \u03b1 would be rational.\n- Non-column via Lemma 1: Choosing |J_0| irrational (e.g., pick U\u2282[0,1/q) of irrational measure and set J_0:=\u22c3_{r=0}^{q\u22121}(U+r/q)) guarantees A is not a column. This yields a robust family with q distinct irreducible periodic tilings whose periods are pairwise incommensurable with \u03b1.\n\n3) Explicit algebra for Proposition D (useful: removes a computation gap). For K=(0,1,2) and \u03c3=(1\u21922\u21923\u21921), Lemma C gives\n-\u03b2 \u2261 a_1+c_1\u2212a_2,   -\u03b2 \u2261 a_2+c_2\u2212a_3,   2\u03b2 \u2261 a_3+c_3\u2212a_1.\nSolving: a_2\u2261a_1+c_1+\u03b2, a_3\u2261a_2+c_2+\u03b2\u2261a_1+c_1+c_2+2\u03b2, and consistency with the third reduces to c_1+c_2+c_3\u22611\u22610 (mod 1), always true. For \u03c3\u2032=(1\u21923\u21922\u21921), Lemma C gives\n-2\u03b2\u2032 \u2261 a_1+c_1\u2212a_3,  \u03b2\u2032 \u2261 a_3+c_3\u2212a_2,  \u03b2\u2032 \u2261 a_2+c_2\u2212a_1.\nSubstitute a_2,a_3 from \u03c3: a_3\u2212a_2\u2261c_2+\u03b2, hence the last two impose \u03b2\u2032\u2261c_2\u2212\u03b2+ c_3 and \u03b2\u2032\u2261c_2+\u03b2\u2212(c_1+\u03b2)=c_2\u2212c_1. Equality of these \u03b2\u2032\u2019s forces c_3\u2261\u2212c_1 (mod 1), i.e. c_1=c_3 since 0<c_i<1. Then \u03b2\u2032\u2261c_2\u2212c_1\u2261(1\u2212c_1\u2212c_3)\u2212c_1\u2261\u22122c_1 (mod 1), and comparing with \u03b2 from \u03c3 gives \u03b2\u2032\u2261\u03b2\u2212c_1 (mod 1) (the relation recorded in output.md). Thus simultaneous compatibility occurs iff c_1=c_3, and then \u03b2\u2032\u2261\u03b2\u2212c_1.\n\nExamples and sanity checks\n- q=3 version (many periods). Take U=[0, t) with t=\u221a2/30. Then J_0:=U\u222a(U+1/3)\u222a(U+2/3) has |J_0|=3t (irrational) and J_0+1/3=J_0. Pick \u03b1=\u221a3/10 mod 1. Then A:=( {0}\u00d7J_0 ) \u222a ( {1}\u00d7(S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1)) ) admits singleton irreducible tilings with periods (1,\u03b1+j/3), j=0,1,2. By Lemma 1, A is not a column; all period ratios are irrational.\n- K={0,1,2} singleton family. Set c_1=c_3=2/5, c_2=1/5, and choose \u03b2 irrational. The \u03c3/\u03c3\u2032 mechanism yields \u03b2\u2032\u2261\u03b2\u2212c_1 and two distinct tilings. Lemma 1 with k_min=0 and \u03bc_min=c_1 implies A is not a column (since 1/c_1 is not an integer). Irreducible by Lemma B.\n\nObstacles and cautions\n- Endpoint conventions: tiles are defined with closed intervals [a_i,b_i], whereas complements produce open components. This affects sets only on measure-zero boundaries; taking closures (or adjusting endpoints) preserves all tiling statements a.e.\n- The general boundary lemma (1) requires X finite and uses that no translate can \u201ccancel\u201d coverage outside X; this is intrinsic to a union-tiling model and rigorous under the a.e. disjointness assumption.\n\nNext steps (proposed additions to output.md)\n- Record Lemma 1 (general boundary obstruction) explicitly; it both simplifies Theorem A\u2019s non-column proof (choose |J_0| irrational) and covers the K={0,1,2} family.\n- Add the q-periodic amplification proposition, giving q distinct irreducible tilings for the same tile, and the simple incommensurability argument for rational shifts j/q with \u03b1 irrational.\n- Include the explicit algebra derivation in Proposition D to remove the computational gap.\n\nGaps spotted in output.md\n- Theorem A currently assumes |J_0|=1/2 and invokes a \u201ccomponent-length\u201d argument to forbid a translational complement; while correct, this can be replaced (or complemented) by the simpler, more general Lemma 1 (choose |J_0| irrational). Suggest revising or adding an alternative non-column proof.\n- Proposition D\u2019s proof is given as a sketch (\u201capply Lemma C and solve\u201d). I supplied a short explicit calculation above for completeness; recommend incorporating it."
