{"progress_md":"Ideas and audit of current output\n- Theorem A, Lemma B, Lemma C, and Proposition D in output.md are coherent and substantially correct for the goals of the task. In particular, the complementary-layer construction A = ({0}×J_0) ∪ ({1}×J_1) with J_1 := S^1 \\ (J_0+α) yields two singleton tilings with periods (1,α) and (1,α+1/2) whenever J_0 has 1/2-periodicity, and the irreducibility/incommensurability parts are sound.\n- Non-column proof in Theorem A is now valid: the per-row measure equation with |J_0|=|J_1|=1/2 implies a boundary row is covered by exactly two translates of J_0; since the two are a.e. disjoint and cover S^1, one must be (a.e.) the complement of the other, i.e., J_0+δ = S^1\\J_0. The “component-length multiset” obstruction to such a δ is correct. That said, the 1/2 hypothesis on |J_0| is stronger than needed; see Lemma 1 below for a simpler, more general non-column criterion.\n- Proposition D (two orders for K={0,1,2}) would benefit from one explicit algebra check; I include it below (short calculation) for easy verification.\n\nNew lemmas and refinements (small, checkable steps)\n1) General boundary obstruction to columnity (useful: quick test A is not a column). Let A be any tile and write K={k_i} and c_i=b_i−a_i. Set k_min:=min_i k_i and μ_min:=∑_{i: k_i=k_min} c_i. If A+T = X×S^1 with X finite (i.e., A is a column), let p:=min X and d_z:=|T_z|. Then necessarily d_{p−k_min}·μ_min = 1, hence 1/μ_min∈N. Proof: Since p is the minimal covered row, no translate with anchor z<p−k_min can appear (it would cover a row <p). Any translate anchored at z=p−k with k>k_min would also cover the row z+k_min = p−(k−k_min)<p, contradicting minimality. Thus row p is covered solely by the d_{p−k_min} copies of the k_min-layer, a.e. disjoint; the measure identity gives d_{p−k_min} μ_min=1. In particular, if 1/μ_min∉N then A is not a column.\n- Consequence for Theorem A and beyond: For K={0,1}, μ_min=|J_0|. Thus if |J_0| is irrational (or not the reciprocal of an integer), A cannot be a column. This removes the need for the “component-length” obstruction and simplifies the non-column proof greatly. It also applies verbatim to the K={0,1,2} singleton family; e.g., if c_1 (the length at k=0) is 2/5, then 1/c_1 is not an integer, so that tile cannot be a column.\n\n2) q-periodic amplification (useful: many different periods for the same A). Let J_0⊂S^1 be 1/q-periodic, i.e. J_0+1/q=J_0, and set J_1:=S^1\\(J_0+α). Define A:=( {0}×J_0 ) ∪ ( {1}×J_1 ). Then for every j=0,1,…,q−1 the set T^{(j)}={ (n, θ_0 + n(α + j/q)) : n∈Z } is a singleton tiling with period (1, α + j/q). Proof: On row n, J_0+θ^{(j)}_n and J_1+θ^{(j)}_{n−1} are complementary since J_1=S^1\\(J_0+α) and J_0+1/q=J_0. Disjointness a.e. holds by construction. Irreducibility holds by Lemma B (singleton, K={0,1}). For α irrational and any j≠j′, incommensurability is automatic: if (α+j/q)/(α+j′/q)∈Q then α would be rational.\n- Non-column via Lemma 1: Choosing |J_0| irrational (e.g., pick U⊂[0,1/q) of irrational measure and set J_0:=⋃_{r=0}^{q−1}(U+r/q)) guarantees A is not a column. This yields a robust family with q distinct irreducible periodic tilings whose periods are pairwise incommensurable with α.\n\n3) Explicit algebra for Proposition D (useful: removes a computation gap). For K=(0,1,2) and σ=(1→2→3→1), Lemma C gives\n-β ≡ a_1+c_1−a_2,   -β ≡ a_2+c_2−a_3,   2β ≡ a_3+c_3−a_1.\nSolving: a_2≡a_1+c_1+β, a_3≡a_2+c_2+β≡a_1+c_1+c_2+2β, and consistency with the third reduces to c_1+c_2+c_3≡1≡0 (mod 1), always true. For σ′=(1→3→2→1), Lemma C gives\n-2β′ ≡ a_1+c_1−a_3,  β′ ≡ a_3+c_3−a_2,  β′ ≡ a_2+c_2−a_1.\nSubstitute a_2,a_3 from σ: a_3−a_2≡c_2+β, hence the last two impose β′≡c_2−β+ c_3 and β′≡c_2+β−(c_1+β)=c_2−c_1. Equality of these β′’s forces c_3≡−c_1 (mod 1), i.e. c_1=c_3 since 0<c_i<1. Then β′≡c_2−c_1≡(1−c_1−c_3)−c_1≡−2c_1 (mod 1), and comparing with β from σ gives β′≡β−c_1 (mod 1) (the relation recorded in output.md). Thus simultaneous compatibility occurs iff c_1=c_3, and then β′≡β−c_1.\n\nExamples and sanity checks\n- q=3 version (many periods). Take U=[0, t) with t=√2/30. Then J_0:=U∪(U+1/3)∪(U+2/3) has |J_0|=3t (irrational) and J_0+1/3=J_0. Pick α=√3/10 mod 1. Then A:=( {0}×J_0 ) ∪ ( {1}×(S^1\\(J_0+α)) ) admits singleton irreducible tilings with periods (1,α+j/3), j=0,1,2. By Lemma 1, A is not a column; all period ratios are irrational.\n- K={0,1,2} singleton family. Set c_1=c_3=2/5, c_2=1/5, and choose β irrational. The σ/σ′ mechanism yields β′≡β−c_1 and two distinct tilings. Lemma 1 with k_min=0 and μ_min=c_1 implies A is not a column (since 1/c_1 is not an integer). Irreducible by Lemma B.\n\nObstacles and cautions\n- Endpoint conventions: tiles are defined with closed intervals [a_i,b_i], whereas complements produce open components. This affects sets only on measure-zero boundaries; taking closures (or adjusting endpoints) preserves all tiling statements a.e.\n- The general boundary lemma (1) requires X finite and uses that no translate can “cancel” coverage outside X; this is intrinsic to a union-tiling model and rigorous under the a.e. disjointness assumption.\n\nNext steps (proposed additions to output.md)\n- Record Lemma 1 (general boundary obstruction) explicitly; it both simplifies Theorem A’s non-column proof (choose |J_0| irrational) and covers the K={0,1,2} family.\n- Add the q-periodic amplification proposition, giving q distinct irreducible tilings for the same tile, and the simple incommensurability argument for rational shifts j/q with α irrational.\n- Include the explicit algebra derivation in Proposition D to remove the computational gap.\n\nGaps spotted in output.md\n- Theorem A currently assumes |J_0|=1/2 and invokes a “component-length” argument to forbid a translational complement; while correct, this can be replaced (or complemented) by the simpler, more general Lemma 1 (choose |J_0| irrational). Suggest revising or adding an alternative non-column proof.\n- Proposition D’s proof is given as a sketch (“apply Lemma C and solve”). I supplied a short explicit calculation above for completeness; recommend incorporating it."}
