{"progress_md":"## Round 0002 — audit, fixes, and new lemmas/extensions\n\nSummary\n- I carefully checked output.md. The core construction (Theorem A) is sound: it produces two distinct singleton tilings with periods (1,α) and (1,α+1/2), both irreducible and incommensurable. The “boundary recurrence” used to rule out columns is essentially correct; I supply an alternative, more algebraic obstruction (Fourier) that removes any lingering ambiguity about the “component-lengths” invariant. I also outline a q-periodic extension and the precise obstruction needed to keep the tile non-column.\n\nAudit of output.md (minor clarifications, no contradictions found)\n- J1 as a union of intervals. J1:=S^1 \\ (J0+α) is a finite union of open intervals (complement of a finite union of closed intervals). The tile model permits endpoints to be chosen so that each component of J1 is represented by a closed arc; any endpoint choices change sets only on measure zero, which is allowed. So A fits the tile format.\n- Non-column proof (item (iii) of Theorem A). The recurrence |J0| d_n + |J1| d_{n−1} = 1_{n∈X} and the boundary argument implying d_p=2 at the leftmost p∈X are correct. The conclusion “two disjoint translates of J0 partition S^1” then forces a translate δ with J0+δ = S^1 \\ J0 (a.e.), a necessary condition that is forbidden by the stated component-length obstruction. This is logically sound. I supply an alternative obstruction below that is easy to check (Fourier).\n\nNew lemma: a Fourier obstruction to translational complement\n- Lemma (no translational complement via Fourier). Let E⊂S^1 be measurable with 0<|E|<1. If there exists δ with E+δ = S^1\\E a.e., then for every nonzero integer t with \\hat{1_E}(t)≠0 one has e^{2π i t δ} = −1. In particular, if there exist two distinct integers t_1,t_2 with \\hat{1_E}(t_j)≠0 and such that there is no δ satisfying e^{2π i t_1 δ}=e^{2π i t_2 δ}=−1, then no such δ exists.\n  Proof sketch. The identity 1_{E+δ}+1_E=1 (a.e.) implies, for t≠0, e^{2π i t δ} \\hat{1_E}(t)+\\hat{1_E}(t)=0, hence the condition. For example, if \\hat{1_E}(2) and \\hat{1_E}(4) are both nonzero, then e^{4π i δ}=−1 and e^{8π i δ}=−1 cannot simultaneously hold; contradiction.\n- Why useful here. For J0 with 1/2-periodicity, all odd Fourier coefficients vanish, but generic even coefficients do not. Choosing U so that \\hat{1_{J0}}(2), \\hat{1_{J0}}(4) ≠ 0 immediately forbids any δ with J0+δ = S^1\\J0. This yields a clean, verifiable criterion replacing the “component-lengths” check in (iii).\n\nExplicit check for Theorem A’s example\n- Take U=[0,0.2]∪[0.3,0.35] inside [0,1/2). Then J0:=U∪(U+1/2). A direct calculation of \\hat{1_{J0}}(2) and \\hat{1_{J0}}(4) (as sums of interval Fourier coefficients) shows both are nonzero (interval endpoints non-resonant). Hence by the Fourier lemma there is no δ with J0+δ = S^1\\J0, confirming the non-column step (iii) by a second method.\n\nq-periodic extension (idea and precise obstruction)\n- Construction. Let q≥2. Choose J0⊂S^1 to be 1/q-periodic (J0+1/q=J0), with 0<|J0|<1, and define J1:=S^1\\(J0+α). Then for each j=0,1,…,q−1, the set T_{α+j/q}:={(n,θ_0+n(α+j/q))} tiles (same complement argument, using J0+1/q=J0). Each tiling is singleton and irreducible as in Theorem A. If α∉Q, then for any j≠0, α/(α+j/q)∉Q: from α/(α+j/q)=p/r one gets α = pj/(rq−p) ∈ Q, contradiction.\n- Non-column caution. The boundary recurrence for a putative finite-column tiling becomes |J0| d_p=1 at a boundary row p, hence d_p = 1/|J0|. Therefore, if |J0|≠1/m for any integer m, A is automatically not a column (since d_p must be an integer). If |J0|=1/m (e.g., m=q in the 1/q-periodic case), then non-column requires forbidding an m-fold translational partition of S^1 by J0. A Fourier generalization applies: if J0+δ_j, j=1,…,m, are disjoint and cover S^1 then \\sum_j e^{2π i t δ_j} \\hat{1_{J0}}(t) = 0 for all t≠0 and m \\hat{1_{J0}}(0)=1, imposing strong constraints. Choosing J0 so that several even Fourier modes are nonzero (e.g., t=2,4) and generic, these constraints are incompatible; thus one can pick explicit J0 (still 1/q-periodic) that is not an m-translational tiler for any m≥2. This would yield q incommensurable singleton tilings while keeping A non-column.\n\nSmall sanity lemmas (recorded for completeness)\n- Boundary recurrence for K={0,1} (fully explicit). In any tiling by A=({0}×J0)∪({1}×J1), writing d_n:=|T_n| gives |J0| d_n + |J1| d_{n−1} = 1 for rows to be fully covered, and 0 when a row is outside the target set X. At the left boundary p of a component of X, one has d_{p−1}=0 and hence |J0| d_p = 1. This is the exact place where the “translational complement/partition” obstruction must apply.\n- Irreducibility check for Theorem A tilings (direct). In T_α or T_{α+1/2}, each row uses exactly two anchors (from rows n and n−1). If row n is assigned to X_1, both anchors must lie in T_1; propagating this both directions forces T_1=T.\n\nNext steps (auditable targets)\n1) q-periodic family: Produce an explicit J0 with 1/q-periodicity that simultaneously (i) has at least two nonzero even Fourier modes (e.g., t=2 and t=4), and (ii) fails to be an m-translational tiler for all m≥2. Then write the non-column proof via the Fourier obstruction carefully.\n2) K={0,1,2} singleton family: finish a clean non-column proof for the c_1=c_3 examples from Proposition D using the boundary-recurrence method adapted to three layers, yielding another independent existence family.\n3) Classification question for Theorem A’s tile: characterize all tilings by A, not just the helical ones T_α and T_{α+1/2}. Even partial constraints (e.g., bounds on sup_n d_n) would strengthen our understanding of uniqueness/rigidity.\n\nGaps noted (for the record)\n- Output.md’s non-column proof uses the component-length multiset invariant; it is correct but somewhat combinatorial. The new Fourier lemma provides a clean alternative and may be easier to verify for concrete U. No other gaps found.\n"}
