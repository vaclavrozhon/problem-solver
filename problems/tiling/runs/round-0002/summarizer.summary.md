Round 0002 audited output.md and supplied several clean lemmas and simplifications. Theorem A (the complementary 2-layer construction) is confirmed: it yields two irreducible singleton tilings with incommensurable periods. Key additions: Lemma E completes the K={0,1,2} two-order family by a simple boundary argument; a general boundary lemma (d_{p−k_min}·μ_min = 1 ⇒ 1/μ_min ∈ N) streamlines all non-column proofs; Proposition G (q‑phase) produces q distinct incommensurable singleton tilings when J_0 is 1/q-periodic; and a Fourier obstruction gives a concrete test forbidding translational complements/partitions. An explicit algebraic check fills a computation gap in Proposition D (compatibility iff c1=c3, with β'≡β−c1). Recommended edits: add these lemmas/propositions to output.md and optionally relax the |J_0|=1/2 hypothesis in Theorem A. See prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json, prover-03.out.json for details. Verifier verdict: partial success.
