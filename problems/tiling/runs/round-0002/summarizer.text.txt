  "summary_md": "Round 0002 audited output.md and supplied several clean lemmas and simplifications. Theorem A (the complementary 2-layer construction) is confirmed: it yields two irreducible singleton tilings with incommensurable periods. Key additions: Lemma E completes the K={0,1,2} two-order family by a simple boundary argument; a general boundary lemma (d_{p−k_min}·μ_min = 1 ⇒ 1/μ_min ∈ N) streamlines all non-column proofs; Proposition G (q‑phase) produces q distinct incommensurable singleton tilings when J_0 is 1/q-periodic; and a Fourier obstruction gives a concrete test forbidding translational complements/partitions. An explicit algebraic check fills a computation gap in Proposition D (compatibility iff c1=c3, with β'≡β−c1). Recommended edits: add these lemmas/propositions to output.md and optionally relax the |J_0|=1/2 hypothesis in Theorem A. See prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json, prover-03.out.json for details. Verifier verdict: partial success.",
  "highlights": [
    "Theorem A validated: complementary-layer tile A = ({0}×J_0) ∪ ({1}×J_1) yields two singleton irreducible tilings with slopes (1,α) and (1,α+1/2) and these periods are incommensurable (prover-01/02/03).",
    "General boundary obstruction (Lemma 1): at a leftmost covered row p one gets d_{p−k_min}·μ_min = 1, so 1/μ_min must be an integer. Thus choosing |J_0| not a reciprocal integer (e.g., irrational) immediately rules out columns (prover-02/01).",
    "Lemma E (K={0,1,2}): if c1 or c3 is not the reciprocal of an integer then A cannot be a column; with c1=c3=s∉{1/m} this completes the two-order family producing two incommensurable tilings (prover-01/02).",
    "Proposition G (q‑phase): if J_0 is 1/q-periodic then for j=0,...,q−1 the singleton sets with slope α+j/q tile; irrational α makes these q periods pairwise incommensurable. Non-column follows from the boundary lemma or Fourier checks (prover-01/02/03).",
    "Fourier obstruction: the identity 1_{E+δ}+1_E=1 forces e^{2π i t δ} = −1 for t with nonzero Fourier coefficients of E; checking a few modes (e.g. t=2,4) yields a verifiable obstruction to translational complements/partitions (prover-03).",
    "Explicit algebra for Proposition D provided: the two-order compatibility holds iff c1=c3, and then β'≡β−c1 (mod 1), closing the computational gap in the sketch (prover-02)."

  "next_questions": [
    "Update output.md to include Lemma 1 (boundary obstruction), Lemma E (K={0,1,2} non-column), Proposition G (q‑phase), and the Fourier obstruction; optionally relax Theorem A's |J_0|=1/2 hypothesis and state the simpler non-column criterion.",
    "Produce an explicit 1/q-periodic example J_0 (give U ⊂ [0,1/q) concretely) whose Fourier coefficients meet the nonzero-mode requirements so it cannot m‑tile S^1 by translates for any m≥2; write a fully auditable non-column proof for that example.",
    "Finish a clean writeup of the K={0,1,2} family (include the boundary argument in full) and, if possible, investigate classification/rigidity of all tilings by A beyond the constructed helical singletons (e.g., constraints on the sequence d_n)."
