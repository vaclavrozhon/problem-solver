Overall, the three prover reports are largely consistent and push the project forward in two key directions: (i) a clean, general “boundary obstruction” to finite-column tilings, which drastically simplifies the non-column proofs, and (ii) the q-phase amplification of the complementary 2-layer construction, yielding q distinct pairwise incommensurable periods for the same tile. I audited the arguments and found them correct with minor presentational fixes.

1) Boundary obstruction. Prover 02’s Lemma 1 is correct, but should be stated with the aggregated measure per height: for each k, let J_k be the union of all arcs at height k within the tile, and μ_k:=|J_k|; then ∑_k μ_k·|T_{m−k}|=1_{m∈X}. The proof at the left boundary p then shows that only anchors with z=p−k_min can appear, hence d_{p−k_min}·μ_{k_min}=1. This yields the corollary for K={0,1} (choose |J_0|∉{1/m}), and, with k_max, the symmetric right-boundary condition. Prover 01’s Lemma E for K={0,1,2} is the same idea specialized to three layers; I filled the small gap at the right boundary by the k_max version. This completes the non-column step for the c_1=c_3 examples (take c_1 not a reciprocal of an integer), thereby upgrading that family to a fully worked example.

2) q-phase generalization. The construction and the incommensurability argument are correct. The endpoint issue for J_1 (complement of a finite union of closed arcs) is benign: reassigning endpoints changes sets on measure zero. Non-column follows immediately by choosing |J_0|∉{1/m}. I recommend we record this as a proposition with a concise proof.

3) Two-order family K={0,1,2}. The explicit algebra provided by Prover 02 matches Lemma C’s congruences and confirms Proposition D rigorously: simultaneous compatibility iff c_1=c_3 and β′≡β−c_1. Combining with the boundary lemma yields a second explicit non-column family. Incommensurability is immediate if c_1 is rational and β is irrational.

4) Fourier obstruction (Prover 03). The Fourier lemma is correct and provides a clean alternative to the “component-length” invariant when |J_0|=1/2 (or more generally when |J_0|=1/m). It is useful to retain in notes as an optional tool; we do not need it for the main proofs once we adopt the boundary criterion, but it may be essential to handle the m-fold partition case when |J_0|=1/m in future refinements.

Concrete next steps:
- Classification: For the complementary 2-layer tiles, attempt to classify all tilings (not just the helical ones). Even partial rigidity (e.g., constraints on d_n) would be impactful.
- m-fold partition obstruction: For |J_0|=1/m, develop a clean criterion (e.g., Fourier sum constraints) to forbid m disjoint translates covering S^1. This extends the non-column result beyond the “|J_0|∉{1/m}” hypothesis.
- Examples: Document an explicit q≥3 example (with a numerical U) satisfying the new proposition and verify the incommensurability numerically/symbolically.
