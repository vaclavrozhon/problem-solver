  "feedback_md": "Overall, the three prover reports are largely consistent and push the project forward in two key directions: (i) a clean, general \u201cboundary obstruction\u201d to finite-column tilings, which drastically simplifies the non-column proofs, and (ii) the q-phase amplification of the complementary 2-layer construction, yielding q distinct pairwise incommensurable periods for the same tile. I audited the arguments and found them correct with minor presentational fixes.\n\n1) Boundary obstruction. Prover 02\u2019s Lemma 1 is correct, but should be stated with the aggregated measure per height: for each k, let J_k be the union of all arcs at height k within the tile, and \u03bc_k:=|J_k|; then \u2211_k \u03bc_k\u00b7|T_{m\u2212k}|=1_{m\u2208X}. The proof at the left boundary p then shows that only anchors with z=p\u2212k_min can appear, hence d_{p\u2212k_min}\u00b7\u03bc_{k_min}=1. This yields the corollary for K={0,1} (choose |J_0|\u2209{1/m}), and, with k_max, the symmetric right-boundary condition. Prover 01\u2019s Lemma E for K={0,1,2} is the same idea specialized to three layers; I filled the small gap at the right boundary by the k_max version. This completes the non-column step for the c_1=c_3 examples (take c_1 not a reciprocal of an integer), thereby upgrading that family to a fully worked example.\n\n2) q-phase generalization. The construction and the incommensurability argument are correct. The endpoint issue for J_1 (complement of a finite union of closed arcs) is benign: reassigning endpoints changes sets on measure zero. Non-column follows immediately by choosing |J_0|\u2209{1/m}. I recommend we record this as a proposition with a concise proof.\n\n3) Two-order family K={0,1,2}. The explicit algebra provided by Prover 02 matches Lemma C\u2019s congruences and confirms Proposition D rigorously: simultaneous compatibility iff c_1=c_3 and \u03b2\u2032\u2261\u03b2\u2212c_1. Combining with the boundary lemma yields a second explicit non-column family. Incommensurability is immediate if c_1 is rational and \u03b2 is irrational.\n\n4) Fourier obstruction (Prover 03). The Fourier lemma is correct and provides a clean alternative to the \u201ccomponent-length\u201d invariant when |J_0|=1/2 (or more generally when |J_0|=1/m). It is useful to retain in notes as an optional tool; we do not need it for the main proofs once we adopt the boundary criterion, but it may be essential to handle the m-fold partition case when |J_0|=1/m in future refinements.\n\nConcrete next steps:\n- Classification: For the complementary 2-layer tiles, attempt to classify all tilings (not just the helical ones). Even partial rigidity (e.g., constraints on d_n) would be impactful.\n- m-fold partition obstruction: For |J_0|=1/m, develop a clean criterion (e.g., Fourier sum constraints) to forbid m disjoint translates covering S^1. This extends the non-column result beyond the \u201c|J_0|\u2209{1/m}\u201d hypothesis.\n- Examples: Document an explicit q\u22653 example (with a numerical U) satisfying the new proposition and verify the incommensurability numerically/symbolically.\n",
  "new_notes_md": "Additional tools and extensions\n\n1) Boundary obstruction to finite-column tilings (general form). For a tile A, define for each height k the aggregated layer J_k\u2282S^1 as the union of all arcs at that height, and \u03bc_k:=|J_k|. In any finite-column tiling A+T=X\u00d7S^1 with X finite and d_n:=|T_n|, the per-row measure identity is\n  \u2211_k \u03bc_k \u00b7 d_{m\u2212k} = 1_{m\u2208X}, for all m\u2208Z.\nIf p:=min X and k_min:=min K, then only anchors with z=p\u2212k_min can appear (any other anchor would create coverage outside X below p). Therefore d_{p\u2212k_min} \u03bc_{k_min}=1, so 1/\u03bc_{k_min}\u2208N. Symmetrically, with q:=max X and k_max:=max K we get d_{q\u2212k_max} \u03bc_{k_max}=1, hence 1/\u03bc_{k_max}\u2208N.\n\nConsequences:\n- K={0,1}: \u03bc_{0}=|J_0|, \u03bc_{1}=|J_1|. If |J_0|\u2209{1/m} then A is not a column. (This yields a very quick non-column test for two-layer tiles, including the complementary construction.)\n- K={0,1,2}: If c_i denotes the total measure at height i (e.g., one interval per layer), then necessarily 1/c_1 and 1/c_3 are integers in any finite-column tiling. In particular, if c_1 or c_3 is not a reciprocal of an integer, the tile is not a column.\n\n2) q-phase generalization of the complementary 2-layer construction. If J_0\u2282S^1 is 1/q-periodic (J_0+1/q=J_0) and J_1:=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1) with \u03b1 irrational, then for each j=0,1,\u2026,q\u22121 the singleton set T_{\u03b1+j/q}:={(n,\u03b8_0+n(\u03b1+j/q))} is a tiling with period (1,\u03b1+j/q). For j\u2260j\u2032, the ratio (\u03b1+j/q)/(\u03b1+j\u2032/q) cannot be rational (else \u03b1 would be rational). If additionally |J_0|\u2209{1/m}, the boundary obstruction implies A is not a column. Irreducibility follows from the singleton-gcd criterion (K={0,1}).\n\n3) Two-order singleton family for K={0,1,2} completed. When c_1=c_3=s, Lemma C shows the two cyclic orders (1\u21922\u21923\u21921) and (1\u21923\u21922\u21921) are simultaneously compatible and the slopes satisfy \u03b2\u2032\u2261\u03b2\u2212s (mod 1). If s\u2209{1/m}, the boundary obstruction rules out columns. If s is rational and \u03b2 is irrational, then \u03b2/(\u03b2\u2032) cannot be rational (else \u03b2 would be rational), so the two periods are incommensurable.\n\n4) Fourier alternative to translational complement. If E\u2282S^1 satisfies E+\u03b4 = S^1\\E a.e., then for all t\u22600 with \\hat{1_E}(t)\u22600 we have e^{2\u03c0 i t \u03b4}=\u22121. In particular, if two distinct t\u2019s have nonzero coefficients and cannot share a \u03b4 with e^{2\u03c0 i t \u03b4}=\u22121 simultaneously, such a \u03b4 cannot exist. This certifies non-columnity in cases like |J_0|=1/m when the boundary obstruction alone does not suffice.\n\nRemark on endpoints. Complements produce open arcs; choosing closed representatives changes sets only on measure-zero boundaries and does not affect any of our tiling or measure identities.\n",

For each height k\u2208K, set J_k:=\u22c3_{i: k_i=k}[a_i,b_i] (union of all arcs at height k) and \u03bc_k:=|J_k|. Suppose A+T=X\u00d7S^1 with X\u2282Z finite, and set d_n:=|T_n|. Then:\n(a) If p:=min X and k_min:=min K, we have d_{p\u2212k_min} \u03bc_{k_min} = 1. In particular, 1/\u03bc_{k_min}\u2208N.\n(b) If q:=max X and k_max:=max K, we have d_{q\u2212k_max} \u03bc_{k_max} = 1. In particular, 1/\u03bc_{k_max}\u2208N.\nProof. The per-row measure identity \u2211_k \u03bc_k\u00b7d_{m\u2212k} = 1_{m\u2208X} holds for all m. For (a), let p=min X. Any translate anchored at z<p\u2212k_min would cover a row <p; likewise, any translate anchored at z=p\u2212k with k>k_min would cover z+k_min<p. Thus the only possible anchors contributing to row p are those with z=p\u2212k_min, and their contributions to row p are copies of J_{k_min}, almost disjoint across anchors. Therefore d_{p\u2212k_min} \u03bc_{k_min}=1. The proof of (b) is symmetric: any translate anchored at z>q\u2212k_max would cover a row >q; and any anchored at z=q\u2212k with k<k_max would cover q+(k_max\u2212k)>q. Thus only z=q\u2212k_max occurs, yielding d_{q\u2212k_max} \u03bc_{k_max}=1. \u220e\n\nCorollary F (Quick non-column test for two-layer tiles). For A=({0}\u00d7J_0)\u222a({1}\u00d7J_1), any finite-column tiling forces |J_0|^{-1}\u2208N. Hence if |J_0|\u2209{1/m: m\u2208N}, A is not a column. \u220e\n\nProposition G (q-phase generalization of the complementary 2-layer construction). Fix q\u22652. Let J_0\u2282S^1 satisfy J_0+1/q=J_0 and choose irrational \u03b1. Define J_1:=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1) and A:=( {0}\u00d7J_0 )\u222a( {1}\u00d7J_1 ). Then:\n(i) For each j=0,1,\u2026,q\u22121 there is a singleton tiling T_{\u03b1+j/q} with period (1,\u03b1+j/q).\n(ii) If j\u2260j\u2032, the periods (1,\u03b1+j/q) and (1,\u03b1+j\u2032/q) are incommensurable.\n(iii) If |J_0|\u2209{1/m: m\u2208N}, then A is not a column.\n(iv) Each T_{\u03b1+j/q} is irreducible.\nProof. (i) Define T_{\u03b1+j/q}:={(n,\u03b8_0+n(\u03b1+j/q))}. On row n, J_0+\u03b8_n and J_1+\u03b8_{n\u22121}=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b8_{n\u22121}+\u03b1)=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b8_n) (since J_0+1/q=J_0), hence they are complementary a.e. (ii) If (\u03b1+j/q)/(\u03b1+j\u2032/q)\u2208Q with j\u2260j\u2032, solve for \u03b1 to find \u03b1\u2208Q, contradiction. (iii) Apply Corollary F with \u03bc_0=|J_0|. (iv) These are singleton tilings with K={0,1} and gcd(K\u2212K)=1, so Lemma B gives irreducibility. \u220e\n\nProposition H (Completion of the K={0,1,2} two-order mechanism: non-column family with two incommensurable periods). Let K=(0,1,2) and c_i=b_i\u2212a_i>0 with c_1+c_2+c_3=1. Assume c_1=c_3=s and s\u2209{1/m: m\u2208N}. Then there exist endpoints a_1,a_2,a_3 and an irrational slope \u03b2 such that the tile A:=\u22c3_{i=1}^3({k_i}\u00d7[a_i,b_i]) admits two distinct singleton tilings corresponding to the cyclic orders \u03c3=(1\u21922\u21923\u21921) and \u03c3\u2032=(1\u21923\u21922\u21921), with slopes \u03b2 and \u03b2\u2032\u2261\u03b2\u2212s (mod 1), respectively. Both tilings are irreducible, their periods are incommensurable if s is rational, and A is not a column.\nProof. By Proposition D (proved via Lemma C), when c_1=c_3 the \u03c3 and \u03c3\u2032 congruence systems are simultaneously compatible and force \u03b2\u2032\u2261\u03b2\u2212c_1. Fix any irrational \u03b2 and a_1, and solve the \u03c3-congruences to obtain a_2,a_3; these also solve \u03c3\u2032. The tilings are singleton, hence irreducible by Lemma B (since \u27e8K\u2212K\u27e9=Z). If s is rational and \u03b2 is irrational, \u03b2/(\u03b2\u2032)\u2208Q would imply \u03b2\u2208Q, a contradiction; thus the periods are incommensurable. Finally, apply Lemma E at both boundaries (\u03bc_0=c_1 and \u03bc_2=c_3) to conclude that any finite-column tiling would force 1/c_1 and 1/c_3 to be integers; since s\u2209{1/m}, no such tiling exists. \u220e\n\nRemark on endpoint conventions. Complements produce open arcs; choosing closed representatives modifies sets only on measure-zero boundaries and does not affect the a.e. tiling statements or the measure identities used above.\n\nSupplement to Proposition D (explicit algebra). For completeness, the \u03c3-system is \u2212\u03b2\u2261a_1+c_1\u2212a_2, \u2212\u03b2\u2261a_2+c_2\u2212a_3, 2\u03b2\u2261a_3+c_3\u2212a_1; solving gives a_2\u2261a_1+c_1+\u03b2 and a_3\u2261a_1+c_1+c_2+2\u03b2, consistent with c_1+c_2+c_3=1. The \u03c3\u2032-system is \u22122\u03b2\u2032\u2261a_1+c_1\u2212a_3, \u03b2\u2032\u2261a_3+c_3\u2212a_2, \u03b2\u2032\u2261a_2+c_2\u2212a_1. Substituting a_2,a_3 and comparing the two expressions for \u03b2\u2032 yields c_1=c_3 and \u03b2\u2032\u2261\u03b2\u2212c_1 (mod 1).\n",
