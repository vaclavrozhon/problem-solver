You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md and output.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers
- notes.md (summary so far)
- output.md (rigorously proven results so far)

Guidelines:
- notes.md: should be a readable running log of interesting work. Prefer appending. Replace only if old notes are clearly misleading. Remember -- notes should be self-contained and should make sense even without seeing outputs of past provers. 
- output.md:  Think twice before you add something to this file. Everything here should be rigorous, almost publication-ready. It should contain only fully proven theorems that are clearly an interesting step towards the solution (or the solution itself). The beginning of the file is a clear list of interesting theorems you can prove, together with a discussion about why it is relevant. From the statement of the theorem it has to be clear that this constitutes nontrivial progress towards solution. The rest of the file contains a fully rigorous list of the proofs of the theorems. Keep only proven theorems with clear proofs. If a statement in that file is flawed / unprecise and you cannot fix it on the spot, remove it from output.md and instead add it to notes.md with explanation.
- Be careful with the booleans `new_notes_append` and `new_outputs_append`: default is True (append). Use False only when deliberately rewriting everything.

Tasks:
1) Audit rigor: identify unjustified steps, false statements, missing lemmas; produce minimal counterexamples.
2) Triage value: separate genuine progress from noise.
3) Guide next steps: propose what provers should try next.

[{"prover_id": "01", "progress_md": "## Round 0002 \u2014 audit, fixes, and new lemmas\n\nAudit of output.md (what stands and what can be tightened)\n- Theorem A is essentially correct and now contains a valid non-column proof using a \u201ccomponent-length\u201d obstruction when |J_0|=1/2. The tiling constructions (periods (1,\u03b1) and (1,\u03b1+1/2)), irreducibility (singleton with K={0,1}), and incommensurability are all sound.\n- Minor simplification available: the non-column step for Theorem A can be made even simpler if we do not insist that |J_0|=1/2. The same two tilings work for any J_0 with 1/2-periodicity; if we pick |J_0|\u2209{1/m: m\u2208N}, then the boundary recurrence forces an integer contradiction immediately (details below). The current proof keeps |J_0|=1/2 and uses the component-length obstruction to rule out the special case d_p=2; both approaches are fine, but the \u201cnon-1/m\u201d route is simpler to state and verify.\n- Proposition D (K={0,1,2}, two orders when c_1=c_3) is correct; the proof sketch via Lemma C is standard. The output currently labels this family as \u201cpending a non-column verification.\u201d I supply below a clean, short non-column criterion that completes this second family under very mild numerical assumptions (in particular, it works for the concrete examples already suggested).\n\nLemma E (non-column for K={0,1,2} with one interval per layer)\n- Statement. Let A have layers at K=(0,1,2) with lengths c_1,c_2,c_3>0, c_1+c_2+c_3=1. If A tiles a finite set X\u00d7S^1, set d_n:=|T_n|. Then necessarily 1/c_1 and 1/c_3 are (nonnegative) integers. In particular, if either c_1 or c_3 is not the reciprocal of an integer, then A is not a column.\n- Proof. The per-row measure identities are\n  c_1 d_n + c_2 d_{n-1} + c_3 d_{n-2} = 1_{n\u2208X},  for all n\u2208Z.\n  Let p:=min X. For n=p\u22122, the right-hand side is 0, all coefficients are positive, hence d_{p\u22122}=d_{p\u22123}=d_{p\u22124}=0. For n=p\u22121, we get c_1 d_{p\u22121}=0, so d_{p\u22121}=0. For n=p, 1=c_1 d_p, so d_p=1/c_1\u2208N. A symmetric argument at the right boundary q:=max X gives d_{q\u22122}=1/c_3\u2208N. This proves the claim. \u220e\n- Consequence for the \u201ctwo-order\u201d family: If we impose c_1=c_3=s and choose s not of the form 1/m (e.g., s=2/5 as in the worked example, or any irrational in (0,1/2)), then A cannot be a column. Combined with Proposition D and the singleton irreducibility criterion, this completes a second explicit family of examples with two irreducible periodic tilings and incommensurable periods (\u03b2 and \u03b2\u2212s).\n\nLemma F (simpler non-column for the complementary 2-layer construction)\n- Setting: Same as Theorem A except we do not fix |J_0|=1/2; still assume J_0+1/2=J_0 and J_1:=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1).\n- Claim. If |J_0|\u2209{1/m: m\u2208N}, then A is not a column.\n- Proof. The per-row measures are |J_0| d_n + (1\u2212|J_0|) d_{n\u22121} = 1_{n\u2208X}. Let p:=min X. For n=p\u22121, 0=|J_0| d_{p\u22121}+(1\u2212|J_0|) d_{p\u22122} forces d_{p\u22121}=d_{p\u22122}=0. For n=p, 1=|J_0| d_p, so d_p=1/|J_0|\u2208N. Contradiction unless |J_0|=1/m. \u220e\n- Remark. This shows the component-length hypothesis in Theorem A is only needed in the special endpoint case |J_0|=1/2 (when the boundary recurrence yields d_p=2). Keeping |J_0|=1/2 is perfectly fine (current output), but the theorem can be simplified by picking |U| so that |J_0|\u22601/2 and |J_0| is not a reciprocal of an integer; then the non-column conclusion is immediate from the boundary equations.\n\nProposition G (q-phase generalization of the 2-layer construction)\n- Statement. Fix q\u22652. Suppose J_0\u2282S^1 is 1/q-periodic (J_0+1/q=J_0). For any irrational \u03b1, define J_1:=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1) and A:=( {0}\u00d7J_0 )\u222a( {1}\u00d7J_1 ). Then for each j=0,1,\u2026,q\u22121 there is a singleton tiling T_{\u03b1+j/q} with period (1,\u03b1+j/q). If j\u2260j\u2032, the periods (1,\u03b1+j/q) and (1,\u03b1+j\u2032/q) are incommensurable. If moreover |J_0|\u2209{1/m: m\u2208N}, then A is not a column.\n- Proof. Define T_{\u03b1+j/q}:={(n,\u03b8_0+n(\u03b1+j/q))}. On row n, contributions are (J_0+\u03b8_n) and (J_1+\u03b8_{n\u22121}). Since J_0+1/q=J_0, J_0+\u03b8_n=J_0+(\u03b8_{n\u22121}+\u03b1+j/q)=J_0+(\u03b8_{n\u22121}+\u03b1); hence J_1+\u03b8_{n\u22121} is the complement of J_0+\u03b8_n, so we have a tiling with period (1,\u03b1+j/q). If (\u03b1+j/q)/(\u03b1+j\u2032/q)\u2208Q with j\u2260j\u2032, rearranging gives \u03b1 as a rational number, contradiction; thus the periods are incommensurable. The non-column condition follows as in Lemma F. \u220e\n\nConcrete check for the K={0,1,2} family (completing the second mechanism)\n- Parameters: c_1=c_3=2/5, c_2=1/5; pick \u03b2 irrational (e.g., \u03b2=\u221a2/10), set a_1=0, and define a_2\u2261a_1+c_1+\u03b2, a_3\u2261a_2+c_2+\u03b2 (mod 1). Then:\n  \u2022 Order \u03c3=(1\u21922\u21923\u21921) produces a tiling with slope \u03b2.\n  \u2022 Order \u03c3\u2032=(1\u21923\u21922\u21921) produces a tiling with slope \u03b2\u2032\u2261\u03b2\u2212c_1 (mod 1).\n  \u2022 By Lemma E, A is not a column because 1/c_1=5/2\u2209N.\n  \u2022 \u03b2/(\u03b2\u2032) is irrational since \u03b2/(\u03b2\u2212c_1)\u2208Q \u21d2 \u03b2\u2208Q (with c_1 rational), a contradiction.\n  \u2022 Irreducibility follows from the singleton irreducibility lemma (H=\u27e8K\u2212K\u27e9=Z).\n\nWhy useful here\n- Lemma E fills the \u201cpending non-column\u201d gap for the K={0,1,2} two-order family under a very mild numerical requirement (e.g., c_1=c_3 not a reciprocal of an integer), thus upgrading that mechanism to a complete existence scheme.\n- Lemma F and Proposition G streamline and extend Theorem A: they show the complementary 2-layer construction yields q distinct incommensurable periods, and provide a simpler non-column criterion.\n\nObstacles and cautions\n- Endpoints: All uses of measure additivity rely on a.e. disjointness; overlaps can occur at finitely many endpoints only, hence measure zero\u2014consistent with the tiling definition.\n- For Theorem A as stated (|J_0|=1/2), the \u201ccomponent-length\u201d obstruction should specify that translation preserves the multiset of component lengths, while (S^1\\J_0) inheres the multiset from the complement of U in [0,1/2); the difference is guaranteed by the hypothesis on U. This is correct as written, but the simpler alternative via Lemma F avoids this case distinction entirely.\n\nNext steps (suggested updates to output.md)\n- Add Lemma E to complete the K={0,1,2} mechanism as a second explicit family of examples.\n- Optionally, rephrase Theorem A to allow arbitrary |J_0| (with 1/2-periodicity) and replace the non-column hypothesis by \u201c|J_0|\u2209{1/m: m\u2208N},\u201d or keep the current |J_0|=1/2 statement and append Lemma F as a remark.\n- Record Proposition G (q-phase generalization) with its incommensurability claim; this shows one tile can admit multiple (\u22652) pairwise incommensurable periods simultaneously.\n"}, {"prover_id": "02", "progress_md": "Ideas and audit of current output\n- Theorem A, Lemma B, Lemma C, and Proposition D in output.md are coherent and substantially correct for the goals of the task. In particular, the complementary-layer construction A = ({0}\u00d7J_0) \u222a ({1}\u00d7J_1) with J_1 := S^1 \\ (J_0+\u03b1) yields two singleton tilings with periods (1,\u03b1) and (1,\u03b1+1/2) whenever J_0 has 1/2-periodicity, and the irreducibility/incommensurability parts are sound.\n- Non-column proof in Theorem A is now valid: the per-row measure equation with |J_0|=|J_1|=1/2 implies a boundary row is covered by exactly two translates of J_0; since the two are a.e. disjoint and cover S^1, one must be (a.e.) the complement of the other, i.e., J_0+\u03b4 = S^1\\J_0. The \u201ccomponent-length multiset\u201d obstruction to such a \u03b4 is correct. That said, the 1/2 hypothesis on |J_0| is stronger than needed; see Lemma 1 below for a simpler, more general non-column criterion.\n- Proposition D (two orders for K={0,1,2}) would benefit from one explicit algebra check; I include it below (short calculation) for easy verification.\n\nNew lemmas and refinements (small, checkable steps)\n1) General boundary obstruction to columnity (useful: quick test A is not a column). Let A be any tile and write K={k_i} and c_i=b_i\u2212a_i. Set k_min:=min_i k_i and \u03bc_min:=\u2211_{i: k_i=k_min} c_i. If A+T = X\u00d7S^1 with X finite (i.e., A is a column), let p:=min X and d_z:=|T_z|. Then necessarily d_{p\u2212k_min}\u00b7\u03bc_min = 1, hence 1/\u03bc_min\u2208N. Proof: Since p is the minimal covered row, no translate with anchor z<p\u2212k_min can appear (it would cover a row <p). Any translate anchored at z=p\u2212k with k>k_min would also cover the row z+k_min = p\u2212(k\u2212k_min)<p, contradicting minimality. Thus row p is covered solely by the d_{p\u2212k_min} copies of the k_min-layer, a.e. disjoint; the measure identity gives d_{p\u2212k_min} \u03bc_min=1. In particular, if 1/\u03bc_min\u2209N then A is not a column.\n- Consequence for Theorem A and beyond: For K={0,1}, \u03bc_min=|J_0|. Thus if |J_0| is irrational (or not the reciprocal of an integer), A cannot be a column. This removes the need for the \u201ccomponent-length\u201d obstruction and simplifies the non-column proof greatly. It also applies verbatim to the K={0,1,2} singleton family; e.g., if c_1 (the length at k=0) is 2/5, then 1/c_1 is not an integer, so that tile cannot be a column.\n\n2) q-periodic amplification (useful: many different periods for the same A). Let J_0\u2282S^1 be 1/q-periodic, i.e. J_0+1/q=J_0, and set J_1:=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1). Define A:=( {0}\u00d7J_0 ) \u222a ( {1}\u00d7J_1 ). Then for every j=0,1,\u2026,q\u22121 the set T^{(j)}={ (n, \u03b8_0 + n(\u03b1 + j/q)) : n\u2208Z } is a singleton tiling with period (1, \u03b1 + j/q). Proof: On row n, J_0+\u03b8^{(j)}_n and J_1+\u03b8^{(j)}_{n\u22121} are complementary since J_1=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1) and J_0+1/q=J_0. Disjointness a.e. holds by construction. Irreducibility holds by Lemma B (singleton, K={0,1}). For \u03b1 irrational and any j\u2260j\u2032, incommensurability is automatic: if (\u03b1+j/q)/(\u03b1+j\u2032/q)\u2208Q then \u03b1 would be rational.\n- Non-column via Lemma 1: Choosing |J_0| irrational (e.g., pick U\u2282[0,1/q) of irrational measure and set J_0:=\u22c3_{r=0}^{q\u22121}(U+r/q)) guarantees A is not a column. This yields a robust family with q distinct irreducible periodic tilings whose periods are pairwise incommensurable with \u03b1.\n\n3) Explicit algebra for Proposition D (useful: removes a computation gap). For K=(0,1,2) and \u03c3=(1\u21922\u21923\u21921), Lemma C gives\n-\u03b2 \u2261 a_1+c_1\u2212a_2,   -\u03b2 \u2261 a_2+c_2\u2212a_3,   2\u03b2 \u2261 a_3+c_3\u2212a_1.\nSolving: a_2\u2261a_1+c_1+\u03b2, a_3\u2261a_2+c_2+\u03b2\u2261a_1+c_1+c_2+2\u03b2, and consistency with the third reduces to c_1+c_2+c_3\u22611\u22610 (mod 1), always true. For \u03c3\u2032=(1\u21923\u21922\u21921), Lemma C gives\n-2\u03b2\u2032 \u2261 a_1+c_1\u2212a_3,  \u03b2\u2032 \u2261 a_3+c_3\u2212a_2,  \u03b2\u2032 \u2261 a_2+c_2\u2212a_1.\nSubstitute a_2,a_3 from \u03c3: a_3\u2212a_2\u2261c_2+\u03b2, hence the last two impose \u03b2\u2032\u2261c_2\u2212\u03b2+ c_3 and \u03b2\u2032\u2261c_2+\u03b2\u2212(c_1+\u03b2)=c_2\u2212c_1. Equality of these \u03b2\u2032\u2019s forces c_3\u2261\u2212c_1 (mod 1), i.e. c_1=c_3 since 0<c_i<1. Then \u03b2\u2032\u2261c_2\u2212c_1\u2261(1\u2212c_1\u2212c_3)\u2212c_1\u2261\u22122c_1 (mod 1), and comparing with \u03b2 from \u03c3 gives \u03b2\u2032\u2261\u03b2\u2212c_1 (mod 1) (the relation recorded in output.md). Thus simultaneous compatibility occurs iff c_1=c_3, and then \u03b2\u2032\u2261\u03b2\u2212c_1.\n\nExamples and sanity checks\n- q=3 version (many periods). Take U=[0, t) with t=\u221a2/30. Then J_0:=U\u222a(U+1/3)\u222a(U+2/3) has |J_0|=3t (irrational) and J_0+1/3=J_0. Pick \u03b1=\u221a3/10 mod 1. Then A:=( {0}\u00d7J_0 ) \u222a ( {1}\u00d7(S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1)) ) admits singleton irreducible tilings with periods (1,\u03b1+j/3), j=0,1,2. By Lemma 1, A is not a column; all period ratios are irrational.\n- K={0,1,2} singleton family. Set c_1=c_3=2/5, c_2=1/5, and choose \u03b2 irrational. The \u03c3/\u03c3\u2032 mechanism yields \u03b2\u2032\u2261\u03b2\u2212c_1 and two distinct tilings. Lemma 1 with k_min=0 and \u03bc_min=c_1 implies A is not a column (since 1/c_1 is not an integer). Irreducible by Lemma B.\n\nObstacles and cautions\n- Endpoint conventions: tiles are defined with closed intervals [a_i,b_i], whereas complements produce open components. This affects sets only on measure-zero boundaries; taking closures (or adjusting endpoints) preserves all tiling statements a.e.\n- The general boundary lemma (1) requires X finite and uses that no translate can \u201ccancel\u201d coverage outside X; this is intrinsic to a union-tiling model and rigorous under the a.e. disjointness assumption.\n\nNext steps (proposed additions to output.md)\n- Record Lemma 1 (general boundary obstruction) explicitly; it both simplifies Theorem A\u2019s non-column proof (choose |J_0| irrational) and covers the K={0,1,2} family.\n- Add the q-periodic amplification proposition, giving q distinct irreducible tilings for the same tile, and the simple incommensurability argument for rational shifts j/q with \u03b1 irrational.\n- Include the explicit algebra derivation in Proposition D to remove the computational gap.\n\nGaps spotted in output.md\n- Theorem A currently assumes |J_0|=1/2 and invokes a \u201ccomponent-length\u201d argument to forbid a translational complement; while correct, this can be replaced (or complemented) by the simpler, more general Lemma 1 (choose |J_0| irrational). Suggest revising or adding an alternative non-column proof.\n- Proposition D\u2019s proof is given as a sketch (\u201capply Lemma C and solve\u201d). I supplied a short explicit calculation above for completeness; recommend incorporating it."}, {"prover_id": "03", "progress_md": "## Round 0002 \u2014 audit, fixes, and new lemmas/extensions\n\nSummary\n- I carefully checked output.md. The core construction (Theorem A) is sound: it produces two distinct singleton tilings with periods (1,\u03b1) and (1,\u03b1+1/2), both irreducible and incommensurable. The \u201cboundary recurrence\u201d used to rule out columns is essentially correct; I supply an alternative, more algebraic obstruction (Fourier) that removes any lingering ambiguity about the \u201ccomponent-lengths\u201d invariant. I also outline a q-periodic extension and the precise obstruction needed to keep the tile non-column.\n\nAudit of output.md (minor clarifications, no contradictions found)\n- J1 as a union of intervals. J1:=S^1 \\ (J0+\u03b1) is a finite union of open intervals (complement of a finite union of closed intervals). The tile model permits endpoints to be chosen so that each component of J1 is represented by a closed arc; any endpoint choices change sets only on measure zero, which is allowed. So A fits the tile format.\n- Non-column proof (item (iii) of Theorem A). The recurrence |J0| d_n + |J1| d_{n\u22121} = 1_{n\u2208X} and the boundary argument implying d_p=2 at the leftmost p\u2208X are correct. The conclusion \u201ctwo disjoint translates of J0 partition S^1\u201d then forces a translate \u03b4 with J0+\u03b4 = S^1 \\ J0 (a.e.), a necessary condition that is forbidden by the stated component-length obstruction. This is logically sound. I supply an alternative obstruction below that is easy to check (Fourier).\n\nNew lemma: a Fourier obstruction to translational complement\n- Lemma (no translational complement via Fourier). Let E\u2282S^1 be measurable with 0<|E|<1. If there exists \u03b4 with E+\u03b4 = S^1\\E a.e., then for every nonzero integer t with \\hat{1_E}(t)\u22600 one has e^{2\u03c0 i t \u03b4} = \u22121. In particular, if there exist two distinct integers t_1,t_2 with \\hat{1_E}(t_j)\u22600 and such that there is no \u03b4 satisfying e^{2\u03c0 i t_1 \u03b4}=e^{2\u03c0 i t_2 \u03b4}=\u22121, then no such \u03b4 exists.\n  Proof sketch. The identity 1_{E+\u03b4}+1_E=1 (a.e.) implies, for t\u22600, e^{2\u03c0 i t \u03b4} \\hat{1_E}(t)+\\hat{1_E}(t)=0, hence the condition. For example, if \\hat{1_E}(2) and \\hat{1_E}(4) are both nonzero, then e^{4\u03c0 i \u03b4}=\u22121 and e^{8\u03c0 i \u03b4}=\u22121 cannot simultaneously hold; contradiction.\n- Why useful here. For J0 with 1/2-periodicity, all odd Fourier coefficients vanish, but generic even coefficients do not. Choosing U so that \\hat{1_{J0}}(2), \\hat{1_{J0}}(4) \u2260 0 immediately forbids any \u03b4 with J0+\u03b4 = S^1\\J0. This yields a clean, verifiable criterion replacing the \u201ccomponent-lengths\u201d check in (iii).\n\nExplicit check for Theorem A\u2019s example\n- Take U=[0,0.2]\u222a[0.3,0.35] inside [0,1/2). Then J0:=U\u222a(U+1/2). A direct calculation of \\hat{1_{J0}}(2) and \\hat{1_{J0}}(4) (as sums of interval Fourier coefficients) shows both are nonzero (interval endpoints non-resonant). Hence by the Fourier lemma there is no \u03b4 with J0+\u03b4 = S^1\\J0, confirming the non-column step (iii) by a second method.\n\nq-periodic extension (idea and precise obstruction)\n- Construction. Let q\u22652. Choose J0\u2282S^1 to be 1/q-periodic (J0+1/q=J0), with 0<|J0|<1, and define J1:=S^1\\(J0+\u03b1). Then for each j=0,1,\u2026,q\u22121, the set T_{\u03b1+j/q}:={(n,\u03b8_0+n(\u03b1+j/q))} tiles (same complement argument, using J0+1/q=J0). Each tiling is singleton and irreducible as in Theorem A. If \u03b1\u2209Q, then for any j\u22600, \u03b1/(\u03b1+j/q)\u2209Q: from \u03b1/(\u03b1+j/q)=p/r one gets \u03b1 = pj/(rq\u2212p) \u2208 Q, contradiction.\n- Non-column caution. The boundary recurrence for a putative finite-column tiling becomes |J0| d_p=1 at a boundary row p, hence d_p = 1/|J0|. Therefore, if |J0|\u22601/m for any integer m, A is automatically not a column (since d_p must be an integer). If |J0|=1/m (e.g., m=q in the 1/q-periodic case), then non-column requires forbidding an m-fold translational partition of S^1 by J0. A Fourier generalization applies: if J0+\u03b4_j, j=1,\u2026,m, are disjoint and cover S^1 then \\sum_j e^{2\u03c0 i t \u03b4_j} \\hat{1_{J0}}(t) = 0 for all t\u22600 and m \\hat{1_{J0}}(0)=1, imposing strong constraints. Choosing J0 so that several even Fourier modes are nonzero (e.g., t=2,4) and generic, these constraints are incompatible; thus one can pick explicit J0 (still 1/q-periodic) that is not an m-translational tiler for any m\u22652. This would yield q incommensurable singleton tilings while keeping A non-column.\n\nSmall sanity lemmas (recorded for completeness)\n- Boundary recurrence for K={0,1} (fully explicit). In any tiling by A=({0}\u00d7J0)\u222a({1}\u00d7J1), writing d_n:=|T_n| gives |J0| d_n + |J1| d_{n\u22121} = 1 for rows to be fully covered, and 0 when a row is outside the target set X. At the left boundary p of a component of X, one has d_{p\u22121}=0 and hence |J0| d_p = 1. This is the exact place where the \u201ctranslational complement/partition\u201d obstruction must apply.\n- Irreducibility check for Theorem A tilings (direct). In T_\u03b1 or T_{\u03b1+1/2}, each row uses exactly two anchors (from rows n and n\u22121).

Set-up and notation
- Work in G = Z × S^1 (S^1 = R/Z). A tile A is a finite union of layers of the form {k_i}×[a_i,b_i] with 0 < b_i−a_i < 1, i=1,…,ℓ. A tiling T ⊂ Z×S^1 is a set of translations such that the (almost everywhere) disjoint union of A+(n,θ) over (n,θ)∈T equals Z×S^1. The fiber at n is T_n := {θ ∈ S^1 : (n,θ) ∈ T}. A period (k,α) means T+(k,α)=T.

Basic facts
- Fiber finiteness. In any tiling, every T_n is finite, and for each m we have ∑_i |T_{m−k_i}|·(b_i−a_i) = 1.
- Period transport. If (k,α) is a period then T_{n+k} = T_n + α for all n.

Singleton-per-row tilings
- Definition: |T_n|=1 for all n. Write T_n={θ_n}. Then column m is the (a.e.) disjoint union of the ℓ intervals [a_i+θ_{m−k_i}, b_i+θ_{m−k_i}], i=1,…,ℓ.
- Fixed cyclic order formulation. If, at each m, the ℓ intervals appear in the same cyclic order σ and meet end-to-end, then for some row phase φ_m one has θ_{m−k_i} = φ_m + c_i − a_i, where c_i are order-dependent constants with c_{σ(i)} ≡ c_i + (b_i−a_i) (mod 1). Consequently θ_{m−k_i} − θ_{m−k_j} is independent of m. If 1∈{k_i}, then θ_n−θ_{n−1} is constant, i.e. T has period (1,β) with β := θ_n−θ_{n−1}.
- Linear congruence system (Prover 03). Under a fixed order σ,
  (k_i − k_{σ(i)}) β ≡ a_i + (b_i−a_i) − a_{σ(i)}  (mod 1),  i=1,…,ℓ.
  For ℓ=3, K={0,1,2}, and orders σ=(1→2→3→1), σ'=(1→3→2→1), the two orders are simultaneously compatible for the same endpoints a_i iff c_1=c_3, and then the slopes satisfy β' ≡ β − c_1 (mod 1). This yields two distinct singleton tilings for the same tile when c_1=c_3.
- Irreducibility (singleton, gcd=1). Let H:=⟨K−K⟩≤Z. If H≠Z then any tiling splits along residue classes mod H; hence irreducibility forces H=Z. Moreover, if |T_n|=1 and H=Z then any partition T=T_1⊔T_2 induces Z=X_1⊔X_2 with X_1 closed under subtraction by each k_i and hence under ±(K−K); since H=Z, X_1 is either ∅ or Z. Thus singleton tilings with gcd(K−K)=1 are irreducible.

Two complementary-layer construction (explicit)
- Choose U⊂S^1 a finite union of disjoint intervals with |U|=1/4 and U∩(U+1/2)=∅ (e.g., U=[0,0.2)∪[0.3,0.35)). Let J_0:=U∪(U+1/2). Then |J_0|=1/2 and J_0+1/2=J_0. Pick an irrational α∈(0,1/2), and set J_1:=S^1\(J_0+α). Define A:=({0}×J_0)∪({1}×J_1).
- Two tilings. For any θ_0, define T_α={ (n, θ_0+nα): n∈Z }. On row n the contributions are (J_0+θ_n) and (J_1+θ_{n−1}) with θ_n=θ_0+nα, which are complementary because J_1=S^1\(J_0+α). Thus A+T_α=Z×S^1 a.e., and T_α has period (1,α). Using J_0+1/2=J_0 the same argument works for α' := α+1/2, giving a tiling T_{α'} with period (1,α'). Both are singleton tilings, hence irreducible by the lemma above (K={0,1} has gcd 1).
- Incommensurability. If α∉Q, then α/(α+1/2)∉Q: from α/(α+1/2)=p/q one deduces α=p/(2(q−p))∈Q, a contradiction.
- Non-column property (finite-column tilings impossible). Say A+T=X×S^1 with X finite. Let d_n:=|T_n|. On row n the union is a.e. disjoint, so |J_0| d_n + |J_1| d_{n−1} = 1_{n∈X}. With |J_0|=|J_1|=1/2 this yields d_n + d_{n−1} = 2·1_{n∈X}. Because X is finite, d_n=0 for all n sufficiently large/small. At the left boundary p of any connected component of X, we get d_{p−1}=0 and hence d_p=2; so row p is tiled by two disjoint translates of J_0 alone. Therefore S^1 is a.e. the disjoint union of two translates of J_0, which forces J_0+δ = S^1\J_0 for some δ. Our choice of U ensures this is impossible (the multiset of lengths of connected components of J_0 differs from that of its complement). Hence no such finite X exists: A is not a column.

Consequences
- This explicit A is a non-column tile that admits two irreducible periodic tilings with incommensurable vertical periods (1,α) and (1,α+1/2).
- Independently, for ℓ=3 and K={0,1,2} with c_1=c_3, the congruence mechanism produces two distinct singleton tilings of the same tile with slopes β and β'≡β−c_1. Picking β irrational makes β/(β') irrational unless a rational relation holds; such relations are at most countable in the parameter.

Next directions
- q-periodic generalization: If J_0 has 1/q-periodicity, the same complementary construction yields q tilings with slopes α+j/q; non-column persists under the same “no translational complement” obstruction.
- Non-column for K={0,1,2} singleton tiles: adapt the boundary-recurrence method with |J_•| = c_• to force a boundary row covered by a single layer, then forbid that layer from tiling S^1 by finitely many translates via a connected-component-length invariant.

Summary of proven results and why they matter
- Main existence theorem. We construct an explicit tile A⊂Z×S^1 that is not a column but admits two irreducible tilings with periods (1,α) and (1,α+1/2), where α is irrational; the two periods are incommensurable. This settles the core existence question positively.
- General structure for singleton tilings. We record a concise congruence system that reduces the singleton-per-row case to linear congruences, and an irreducibility criterion (gcd(K−K)=1).
- Two-order mechanism for K={0,1,2}. When c_1=c_3, a single tile admits two distinct singleton tilings corresponding to the cyclic orders (1→2→3→1) and (1→3→2→1); the slopes differ by c_1 modulo 1. This gives a second, independent family of examples (pending a non-column verification).

Theorem A (Non-column tile with two incommensurable periods). Fix an irrational α∈(0,1/2). Let U⊂S^1 be a finite union of disjoint intervals of total length 1/4 such that U∩(U+1/2)=∅ and the multiset of lengths of connected components of U is different from that of its complement in [0,1/2). Define J_0:=U∪(U+1/2) (so |J_0|=1/2 and J_0+1/2=J_0), J_1:=S^1\(J_0+α), and set A:=( {0}×J_0 ) ∪ ( {1}×J_1 ). Then:
(i) There is a tiling T_α with period (1,α), and a tiling T_{α+1/2} with period (1,α+1/2).
(ii) Both tilings are irreducible.
(iii) A is not a column (i.e., there is no finite X⊂Z and T⊂Z×S^1 with A+T=X×S^1).
(iv) The periods are incommensurable: α/(α+1/2)∉Q.
Proof.
(i) Define T_α:={(n,θ_0+nα): n∈Z}. On row n the contributions are (J_0+θ_n) with θ_n=θ_0+nα and (J_1+θ_{n−1}). Since J_1=S^1\(J_0+α), we have J_1+θ_{n−1}=S^1\(J_0+θ_{n−1}+α)=S^1\(J_0+θ_n). Thus these two sets are complementary (disjoint a.e. and union S^1), giving a tiling. The definition is invariant under (1,α), so T_α has period (1,α). For α' := α+1/2, define T_{α'} analogously; the identity J_0+1/2=J_0 yields J_1+θ'_{n−1}=S^1\(J_0+θ'_n), so T_{α'} tiles with period (1,α').
(ii) These are singleton tilings with K={0,1}; since gcd{0−0,0−1,1−0,1−1}=1, the irreducibility lemma below applies.
(iii) Suppose A+T=X×S^1 with X finite. Let d_n:=|T_n|. By a.e. disjointness, on each n∈Z we have |J_0| d_n + |J_1| d_{n−1} = 1_{n∈X}. Since |J_0|=|J_1|=1/2, this simplifies to d_n + d_{n−1} = 2·1_{n∈X}. Because X is finite, d_n=0 for all sufficiently large |n|; in particular, at the left endpoint p of any connected component of X we have d_{p−1}=0, hence d_p=2. Thus row p is tiled entirely by two disjoint translates of J_0. This forces S^1 to be a.e. the disjoint union of two translates of J_0, i.e., J_0+δ = S^1\J_0 for some δ. But translation preserves the multiset of connected-component lengths, which by construction differs between J_0 and its complement (coming from the complement of U in [0,1/2)), a contradiction. Therefore A admits no finite-column tiling.
(iv) If α/(α+1/2)=p/q∈Q, then α = (p/q)(α+1/2), so α(1−p/q)=p/(2q), hence α=p/(2(q−p))∈Q, contradicting the choice of α.

Lemma B (Irreducibility for singleton tilings with gcd(K−K)=1). Let A have layers at K={k_1,…,k_ℓ} and suppose |T_n|=1 for all n (singleton). Let H:=⟨K−K⟩≤Z. If H=Z then any tiling is irreducible: any putative partition T=T_1⊔T_2 forces the index set X_1={n: T_n⊂T_1} to be closed under subtraction by each k_i and hence under ±(K−K); since H=Z, X_1 is either ∅ or Z.
Proof. As sketched; the closure shows X_1 is a union of cosets of H=Z, hence trivial.
∎

Lemma C (Singleton congruences under a fixed cyclic order). Assume |T_n|=1 and the ℓ intervals appear in a fixed cyclic order σ on every row. Then if β:=θ_n−θ_{n−1} (mod 1), the adjacency constraints are equivalent to the congruence system
 (k_i − k_{σ(i)}) β ≡ a_i + (b_i−a_i) − a_{σ(i)}  (mod 1), i=1,…,ℓ.
Proof. Writing θ_{m−k_i}=φ_m + c_i − a_i and matching consecutive endpoints in order σ gives the displayed congruences.
∎

Proposition D (Two orders for K={0,1,2}). Let ℓ=3, K=(0,1,2), c_i=b_i−a_i>0 with c_1+c_2+c_3=1. Consider orders σ=(1→2→3→1) and σ'=(1→3→2→1). Then the two orders are simultaneously compatible for the same endpoints a_i iff c_1=c_3. In that case, if the first tiling has slope β, the second has slope β'≡β−c_1 (mod 1).
Proof. Apply Lemma C to σ and σ', solve the σ-system for a_2,a_3 in terms of a_1,β,c’s, and substitute into the σ'-system. Consistency is equivalent to c_1=c_3, and then β' is forced to equal β−c_1 (mod 1).
∎
