I audited the arguments and found them correct with minor presentational fixes.\\n\\n1) Boundary obstruction. Prover 02’s Lemma 1 is correct, but should be stated with the aggregated measure per height: for each k, let J_k be the union of all arcs at height k within the tile, and μ_k:=|J_k|; then ∑_k μ_k·|T_{m−k}|=1_{m∈X}. The proof at the left boundary p then shows that only anchors with z=p−k_min can appear, hence d_{p−k_min}·μ_{k_min}=1. This yields the corollary for K={0,1} (choose |J_0|∉{1/m}), and, with k_max, the symmetric right-boundary condition. Prover 01’s Lemma E for K={0,1,2} is the same idea specialized to three layers; I filled the small gap at the right boundary by the k_max version. This completes the non-column step for the c_1=c_3 examples (take c_1 not a reciprocal of an integer), thereby upgrading that family to a fully worked example.\\n\\n2) q-phase generalization. The construction and the incommensurability argument are correct. The endpoint issue for J_1 (complement of a finite union of closed arcs) is benign: reassigning endpoints changes sets on measure zero. Non-column follows immediately by choosing |J_0|∉{1/m}. I recommend we record this as a proposition with a concise proof.\\n\\n3) Two-order family K={0,1,2}. The explicit algebra provided by Prover 02 matches Lemma C’s congruences and confirms Proposition D rigorously: simultaneous compatibility iff c_1=c_3 and β′≡β−c_1. Combining with the boundary lemma yields a second explicit non-column family. Incommensurability is immediate if c_1 is rational and β is irrational.\\n\\n4) Fourier obstruction (Prover 03). The Fourier lemma is correct and provides a clean alternative to the “component-length” invariant when |J_0|=1/2 (or more generally when |J_0|=1/m). It is useful to retain in notes as an optional tool; we do not need it for the main proofs once we adopt the boundary criterion, but it may be essential to handle the m-fold partition case when |J_0|=1/m in future refinements.\\n\\nConcrete next steps:\\n- Classification: For the complementary 2-layer tiles, attempt to classify all tilings (not just the helical ones). Even partial rigidity (e.g., constraints on d_n) would be impactful.\\n- m-fold partition obstruction: For |J_0|=1/m, develop a clean criterion (e.g., Fourier sum constraints) to forbid m disjoint translates covering S^1. This extends the non-column result beyond the “|J_0|∉{1/m}” hypothesis.\\n- Examples: Document an explicit q≥3 example (with a numerical U) satisfying the new proposition and verify the incommensurability numerically/symbolically.\\n\",\"new_notes_md\":\"Additional tools and extensions\\n\\n1) Boundary obstruction to finite-column tilings (general form). For a tile A, define for each height k the aggregated layer J_k⊂S^1 as the union of all arcs at that height, and μ_k:=|J_k|. In any finite-column tiling A+T=X×S^1 with X finite and d_n:=|T_n|, the per-row measure identity is\\n  ∑_k μ_k · d_{m−k} = 1_{m∈X}, for all m∈Z.\\nIf p:=min X and k_min:=min K, then only anchors with z=p−k_min can appear (any other anchor would create coverage outside X below p). Therefore d_{p−k_min} μ_{k_min}=1, so 1/μ_{k_min}∈N. Symmetrically, with q:=max X and k_max:=max K we get d_{q−k_max} μ_{k_max}=1, hence 1/μ_{k_max}∈N.\\n\\nConsequences:\\n- K={0,1}: μ_{0}=|J_0|, μ_{1}=|J_1|. If |J_0|∉{1/m} then A is not a column. (This yields a very quick non-column test for two-layer tiles, including the complementary construction.)\\n- K={0,1,2}: If c_i denotes the total measure at height i (e.g., one interval per layer), then necessarily 1/c_1 and 1/c_3 are integers in any finite-column tiling. In particular, if c_1 or c_3 is not a reciprocal of an integer, the tile is not a column.\\n\\n2) q-phase generalization of the complementary 2-layer construction. If J_0⊂S^1 is 1/q-periodic (J_0+1/q=J_0) and J_1:=S^1\\\\(J_0+α) with α irrational, then for each j=0,1,…,q−1 the singleton set T_{α+j/q}:={(n,θ_0+n(α+j/q))} is a tiling with period (1,α+j/q). For j≠j′, the ratio (α+j/q)/(α+j′/q) cannot be rational (else α would be rational). If additionally |J_0|∉{1/m}, the boundary obstruction implies A is not a column. Irreducibility follows from the singleton-gcd criterion (K={0,1}).\\n\\n3) Two-order singleton family for K={0,1,2} completed. When c_1=c_3=s, Lemma C shows the two cyclic orders (1→2→3→1) and (1→3→2→1) are simultaneously compatible and the slopes satisfy β′≡β−s (mod 1). If s∉{1/m}, the boundary obstruction rules out columns. If s is rational and β is irrational, then β/(β′) cannot be rational (else β would be rational), so the two periods are incommensurable.\\n\\n4) Fourier alternative to translational complement. If E⊂S^1 satisfies E+δ = S^1\\\\E a.e., then for all t≠0 with \\\\hat{1_E}(t)≠0 we have e^{2π i t δ}=−1. In particular, if two distinct t’s have nonzero coefficients and cannot share a δ with e^{2π i t δ}=−1 simultaneously, such a δ cannot exist. This certifies non-columnity in cases like |J_0|=1/m when the boundary obstruction alone does not suffice.\\n\\nRemark on endpoints. Complements produce open arcs; choosing closed representatives changes sets only on measure-zero boundaries and does not affect any of our tiling or measure identities.\\n\",\"new_notes_append\":\"True\",\"new_outputs_md\":\"Additional proven results (completing and extending the main constructions)\\n\\nLemma E (Boundary obstruction to finite-column tilings). Let A⊂Z×S^1 be a tile. For each height k∈K, set J_k:=⋃_{i: k_i=k}[a_i,b_i] (union of all arcs at height k) and μ_k:=|J_k|. Suppose A+T=X×S^1 with X⊂Z finite, and set d_n:=|T_n|. Then:\\n(a) If p:=min X and k_min:=min K, we have d_{p−k_min} μ_{k_min} = 1. In particular, 1/μ_{k_min}∈N.\\n(b) If q:=max X and k_max:=max K, we have d_{q−k_max} μ_{k_max} = 1. In particular, 1/μ_{k_max}∈N.\\nProof. The per-row measure identity ∑_k μ_k·d_{m−k} = 1_{m∈X} holds for all m. For (a), let p=min X. Any translate anchored at z<p−k_min would cover a row <p; likewise, any translate anchored at z=p−k with k>k_min would cover z+k_min<p. Thus the only possible anchors contributing to row p are those with z=p−k_min, and their contributions to row p are copies of J_{k_min}, almost disjoint across anchors. Therefore d_{p−k_min} μ_{k_min}=1. The proof of (b) is symmetric: any translate anchored at z>q−k_max would cover a row >q; and any anchored at z=q−k with k<k_max would cover q+(k_max−k)>q. Thus only z=q−k_max occurs, yielding d_{q−k_max} μ_{k_max}=1. ∎\\n\\nCorollary F (Quick non-column test for two-layer tiles). For A=({0}×J_0)∪({1}×J_1), any finite-column tiling forces |J_0|^{-1}∈N. Hence if |J_0|∉{1/m: m∈N}, A is not a column. ∎\\n\\nProposition G (q-phase generalization of the complementary 2-layer construction). Fix q≥2. Let J_0⊂S^1 satisfy J_0+1/q=J_0 and choose irrational α. Define J_1:=S^1\\\\(J_0+α) and A:=( {0}×J_0 )∪( {1}×J_1 ). Then:\\n(i) For each j=0,1,…,q−1 there is a singleton tiling T_{α+j/q} with period (1,α+j/q).\\n(ii) If j≠j′, the periods (1,α+j/q) and (1,α+j′/q) are incommensurable.\\n(iii) If |J_0|∉{1/m: m∈N}, then A is not a column.\\n(iv) Each T_{α+j/q} is irreducible.\\nProof. (i) Define T_{α+j/q}:={(n,θ_0+n(α+j/q))}. On row n, J_0+θ_n and J_1+θ_{n−1}=S^1\\\\(J_0+θ_{n−1}+α)=S^1\\\\(J_0+θ_n) (since J_0+1/q=J_0), hence they are complementary a.e. (ii) If (α+j/q)/(α+j′/q)∈Q with j≠j′, solve for α to find α∈Q, contradiction. (iii) Apply Corollary F with μ_0=|J_0|. (iv) These are singleton tilings with K={0,1} and gcd(K−K)=1, so Lemma B gives irreducibility. ∎\\n\\nProposition H (Completion of the K={0,1,2} two-order mechanism: non-column family with two incommensurable periods). Let K=(0,1,2) and c_i=b_i−a_i>0 with c_1+c_2+c_3=1. Assume c_1=c_3=s and s∉{1/m: m∈N}. Then there exist endpoints a_1,a_2,a_3 and an irrational slope β such that the tile A:=⋃_{i=1}^3({k_i}×[a_i,b_i]) admits two distinct singleton tilings corresponding to the cyclic orders σ=(1→2→3→1) and σ′=(1→3→2→1), with slopes β and β′≡β−s (mod 1), respectively. Both tilings are irreducible, their periods are incommensurable if s is rational, and A is not a column.\\nProof. By Proposition D (proved via Lemma C), when c_1=c_3 the σ and σ′ congruence systems are simultaneously compatible and force β′≡β−c_1. Fix any irrational β and a_1, and solve the σ-congruences to obtain a_2,a_3; these also solve σ′. The tilings are singleton, hence irreducible by Lemma B (since ⟨K−K⟩=Z). If s is rational and β is irrational, β/(β′)∈Q would imply β∈Q, a contradiction; thus the periods are incommensurable. Finally, apply Lemma E at both boundaries (μ_0=c_1 and μ_2=c_3) to conclude that any finite-column tiling would force 1/c_1 and 1/c_3 to be integers; since s∉{1/m}, no such tiling exists. ∎\\n\\nRemark on endpoint conventions. Complements produce open arcs; choosing closed representatives modifies sets only on measure-zero boundaries and does not affect the a.e. tiling statements or the measure identities used above.\\n\\nSupplement to Proposition D (explicit algebra). For completeness, the σ-system is −β≡a_1+c_1−a_2, −β≡a_2+c_2−a_3, 2β≡a_3+c_3−a_1; solving gives a_2≡a_1+c_1+β and a_3≡a_1+c_1+c_2+2β, consistent with c_1+c_2+c_3=1. The σ′-system is −2β′≡a_1+c_1−a_3, β′≡a_3+c_3−a_2, β′≡a_2+c_2−a_1. Substituting a_2,a_3 and comparing the two expressions for β′ yields c_1=c_3 and β′≡β−c_1 (mod 1).\\n\",\"new_outputs_append\":\"True\",\"verdict\":\"partial success\"}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"auto","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"VerifierNewSchema","schema_":{"properties":{"feedback_md":{"title":"Feedback Md","type":"string"},"new_notes_md":{"title":"New Notes Md","type":"string"},"new_notes_append":{"title":"New Notes Append","type":"string"},"new_outputs_md":{"title":"New Outputs Md","type":"string"},"new_outputs_append":{"title":"New Outputs Append","type":"string"},"verdict":{"title":"Verdict","type":"string"}},"required":["feedback_md","new_notes_md","new_notes_append","new_outputs_md","new_outputs_append","verdict"],"title":"VerifierNewSchema","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":11026,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":15478,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":12288},"total_tokens":26504},"user":null,"store":true}
