Overall, the three prover reports are largely consistent and push the project forward in two key directions: (i) a clean, general “boundary obstruction” to finite-column tilings, which drastically simplifies the non-column proofs, and (ii) the q-phase amplification of the complementary 2-layer construction, yielding q distinct pairwise incommensurable periods for the same tile. I audited the arguments and found them correct with minor presentational fixes.
