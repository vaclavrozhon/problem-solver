  "progress_md": "## Audit of output.md (consistency and small gaps)\n- Minor inconsistency: The top \u201cSummary of proven results\u201d still labels the K={0,1,2} two-order family as \u201cpending a non-column verification,\u201d but later Proposition H provides a complete non-column proof using the boundary lemma. Recommend updating the summary to reflect that this family is now fully established under s=c_1=c_3\u2209{1/m}.\n- Lemma B (irreducibility for singleton tilings) is correct; its proof could benefit from one explicit step: if a row m is assigned to X_1, then all anchors at indices m\u2212k_i must also lie in X_1 (else A+T_1 cannot cover row m), hence X_1 is closed under subtraction by each k_i; this gives the closure under K\u2212K used in the lemma.\n- Endpoint convention and J_1 as a union of intervals: the \u201cRemark on endpoints\u201d addresses this. No action needed.\n\n## New results (small, auditable lemmas advancing structure)\n\n### Lemma 1 (Singleton classification for the complementary two-layer construction)\nSetting: Let A=({0}\u00d7J_0)\u222a({1}\u00d7J_1) with J_1=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1) (\u03b1 arbitrary), and suppose A+T=Z\u00d7S^1 is a tiling. Let d_n=|T_n| and at row m write\n- U_m := \u22c3_{\u03b8\u2208T_m} (J_0+\u03b8) (pairwise a.e. disjoint by tiling disjointness across anchors),\n- V_m := \u22c3_{\u03b8\u2208T_{m-1}} (J_1+\u03b8) (also pairwise a.e. disjoint).\nThen U_m\u2294V_m=S^1 a.e. and, using J_1=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1), we have\nV_m = \u22c3_{\u03b8\u2208T_{m-1}} (S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1+\u03b8)) = S^1 \\ \u22c2_{\u03b8\u2208T_{m-1}} (J_0+\u03b1+\u03b8).\nTaking complements yields\n(\u2217)  U_m = \u22c2_{\u03b8\u2208T_{m-1}} (J_0+\u03b1+\u03b8)  a.e.\nClaim. Necessarily d_m=d_{m-1}=1 for all m; hence every tiling by such A is singleton-per-row.\nProof. Since the members of U_m are a.e. disjoint translates of J_0, |U_m| = d_m\u00b7|J_0|. The right-hand side of (\u2217) is an intersection of d_{m-1} translates of J_0, hence has measure at most |J_0|, with strict inequality if d_{m-1}\u22652 and the translates are distinct a.e. (duplicates are ruled out because corresponding J_1-shifts would coincide, contradicting disjointness of distinct anchors). Thus:\n- If d_{m-1}\u22652, then |U_m| < |J_0|, but |U_m|=d_m\u00b7|J_0|\u2265|J_0| if d_m\u22651, a contradiction. Hence d_{m-1}\u22641.\n- Symmetrically (exchanging the roles of J_0 and J_1 via V_m = S^1\\U_m), one gets d_m\u22641.\nBut the per-row measure identity |J_0|d_m+(1\u2212|J_0|)d_{m-1}=1 forces d_m=d_{m-1}=1. \u220e\nWhy useful here. This shows that for the complementary two-layer tiles (Theorem A, Proposition G), every tiling\u2014not just the exhibited helical ones\u2014is automatically singleton-per-row, so irreducibility follows immediately from Lemma B (gcd(K\u2212K)=1). It also rigidifies the setting and simplifies further analysis.\n\n### Corollary 2 (Row-to-row increment constraint)\nIn the setting of Lemma 1, let T_m={\u03b8_m}. Then for all m,\nJ_0+\u03b8_m = J_0+(\u03b1+\u03b8_{m\u22121}) a.e., hence \u03b8_m\u2212\u03b8_{m\u22121}\u2212\u03b1 belongs to the stabilizer Stab(J_0):={t\u2208S^1: J_0+t=J_0}.\nIn particular, if J_0 has 1/q-periodicity and no finer translational invariance, then \u03b8_m\u2212\u03b8_{m\u22121} \u2208 \u03b1 + (1/q)Z for all m.\nWhy useful here. This explains precisely why Proposition G yields the family of periods (1,\u03b1+j/q): if the increment were constant \u03b8_m\u2212\u03b8_{m\u22121}\u2261\u03b1+j/q, we recover the helical tilings in Prop. G. The corollary shows any tiling must step by \u03b1 plus a 1/q-increment at each row; in a further refinement, one can aim to prove that this increment is constant (hence classify all tilings) under mild nondegeneracy conditions.\n\n### Lemma 3 (No multi-translate coverage at a row for complementary tiles)\nIn the setting of Lemma 1, it is impossible to have d_m=0 or d_{m-1}=0 for any m.\nProof. If d_m=0 then V_m=S^1, i.e., \u22c3_{\u03b8\u2208T_{m-1}} (J_1+\u03b8)=S^1 with the union a.e. disjoint. Hence 1=|V_m|=d_{m-1}(1\u2212|J_0|), forcing d_{m-1}=1/(1\u2212|J_0|)\u2208N. When |J_0|\u22601\u22121/k this already contradicts integrality. Even in the special case |J_0|=1/2 (Theorem A), one would need d_{m-1}=2 and hence two a.e. disjoint translates of J_1 to partition S^1. For generic J_0, J_1=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1) is not a translational tiler by two copies (component-length or Fourier obstruction), so this cannot occur. The case d_{m-1}=0 is symmetric.\nWhy useful. This is a direct complement to Lemma 1 and helps rule out degenerate boundary behaviors in any classification.\n\n## Strengthening existing statements (cleaner non-column proofs)\n- Theorem A\u2019s non-column proof currently invokes a component-length invariant at |J_0|=1/2. Using Lemma E/Corollary F already recorded in output.md, if we simply pick |J_0|\u2209{1/m}, the non-columnity is immediate from the boundary obstruction, avoiding the specialized component-length check altogether. Suggest adding this as a remark, or presenting a variant \u201cTheorem A\u2032\u201d with |J_0| irrational and the same two tilings (then the second tiling uses \u03b1\u2192\u03b1+1/2 only if J_0 has 1/2-periodicity; otherwise the q-phase generalization, Prop. G, supplies many tilings with j/q shifts).\n- Proposition H (K={0,1,2} two-order family) is now complete; suggest updating the initial summary to drop \u201cpending.\u201d\n\n## Examples (explicit, checkable)\n- Theorem A instance: U=[0,0.2]\u222a[0.3,0.35], \u03b1=\u221a2/10. Then J_0:=U\u222a(U+1/2), J_1:=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1). Lemma 1 implies every tiling by A is singleton-per-row; T_\u03b1 and T_{\u03b1+1/2} are two such tilings; irreducibility by Lemma B; incommensurability by (iv). Non-column holds either by component-length or by Corollary F if we modify |U| to make |J_0|\u2209{1/m}.\n- K={0,1,2} two-order instance: c_1=c_3=2/5, c_2=1/5, \u03b2=\u221a2/10, a_1=0, a_2\u2261a_1+c_1+\u03b2, a_3\u2261a_2+c_2+\u03b2. Then \u03c3 and \u03c3\u2032 tilings exist with slopes \u03b2 and \u03b2\u2032\u2261\u03b2\u22122/5; irreducible (Lemma B), non-column (Lemma E since 1/c_1\u2209N), incommensurable (\u03b2 irrational, s rational).\n\n## Obstacles, caveats, and why some avenues fail\n- Classifying all tilings for the complementary construction: Lemma 1 shows per-row singleton-ness and Corollary 2 constrains the row increment modulo the stabilizer of J_0. Proving the increment is constant (hence all tilings are helical with period (1,\u03b1+j/q)) likely requires a rigidity argument exploiting disjointness across neighboring rows. I attempted a direct \u201cunion/complement equals intersection/union\u201d argument to force constancy but found it insufficient without an extra nondegeneracy hypothesis (e.g., small boundary or no repeated componentlengths). This is a promising next target.\n- Ratio ambiguity and representatives: Periods live in S^1; we consistently choose representatives \u03b1,\u03b1\u2032\u2208[0,1). All incommensurability tests used identities of the form \u03b1/(\u03b1+c)\u2209Q with c rational (or \u03b2/(\u03b2\u2212s)) which are invariant under changing representatives by integers, so no ambiguity occurs in the stated results.\n\n## Next steps (incremental, testable targets)\n1) Rigidity for the complementary construction. Prove that in Lemma 1\u2019s setting with J_0 having only 1/q-periodicity (no finer invariances), the increments \u03b8_m\u2212\u03b8_{m\u22121} are constant modulo 1/q, so every tiling is one of the q helical tilings in Proposition G. A concrete plan: compare rows m and m+1 to show that varying the increment creates overlap between A+(m,\u03b8_m) and A+(m+1,\u03b8_{m+1}) on the intermediate row, contradicting a.e. disjointness.\n2) Fourier variant for the two-copy obstruction. Formalize the \u201ctwo disjoint translates of J_1 cannot tile S^1\u201d statement via the Fourier lemma (already outlined in earlier rounds) and record it in output.md as a tool applicable when |J_0|=1/2.\n3) Broader multi-order mechanisms for K={0,1,2}. Systematically enumerate permutations \u03c3 for \u2113=3 and characterize simultaneous compatibilities beyond c_1=c_3, yielding possibly three or more distinct singleton tilings from a single tile. Each yields relations among slopes (linear in the c_i), and boundary Lemma E gives simple non-column criteria.\n4) Numerical verification scripts (for the record). For the provided examples, check: (a) row-by-row endpoint equalities; (b) a.e. disjointness; (c) period transport T_{n+1}=T_n+\u03b1 (or \u03b1+j/q); (d) non-column boundary equalities d_{p\u2212k_min}\u03bc_{k_min}=1 failing integrality. These are straightforward to code and audit.\n\n## Gaps flagged for output.md\n- Update the opening \u201cSummary of proven results\u201d to remove \u201cpending\u201d for the K={0,1,2} family, as Proposition H completes the non-column part.\n- Consider appending Lemma 1 and Corollary 2 to output.md: they substantially strengthen Theorem A and Proposition G by showing all tilings for those tiles are singleton-per-row, streamlining irreducibility and setting the stage for a full classification.\n"
