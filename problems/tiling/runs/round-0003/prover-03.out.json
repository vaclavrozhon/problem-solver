The current proof sketches necessity (matching endpoints in a fixed cyclic order yields the congruences). To justify equivalence, one should prove: if \u03b2 and the a_i satisfy (k_i\u2212k_{\u03c3(i)})\u03b2 \u2261 a_i+c_i\u2212a_{\u03c3(i)} (mod 1), then defining \u03b8_n:=\u03b8_0+n\u03b2 produces, for each row m, a phase \u03c6_m with \u03b8_{m\u2212k_i} = \u03c6_m + c_i \u2212 a_i and the \u03c3-adjacency equalities, hence a valid end-to-end partition of S^1 by the intervals [a_i+\u03b8_{m\u2212k_i}, a_i+\u03b8_{m\u2212k_i}+c_i]. This is a straightforward check but should be inserted to fully justify \u201cequivalent.\u201d\n- Theorem A(iii) (non-column): the step \u201cBecause X is finite, d_n=0 for all sufficiently large |n|\u201d is true but could be tightened. For K={0,1}, any anchor z contributes to rows z and z+1. If X is finite with p:=min X and q:=max X, then necessarily T_z=\u2205 unless z\u2208[p\u22121,q], hence d_n=0 for n<p\u22121 and n>q. This explicit localisation can be cited before deducing d_{p\u22121}=0 and d_p=2.\n- Endpoint convention for J_1: The remark at the end covers this, but it may help to explicitly state in Theorem A that J_1 can be chosen as a finite union of closed arcs differing from S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1) on a null set, keeping within the tile format.\n- Proposition D: the explicit algebra is given in the \u201cSupplement,\u201d which is excellent. To align with Lemma C\u2019s \u201cequivalence,\u201d it would be good to add a one-liner that, conversely, these congruences ensure the \u03c3 and \u03c3\u2032 partitions exist with \u03b8_n=\u03b8_0+n\u03b2 and \u03b8\u2032_n=\u03b8\u2032_0+n\u03b2\u2032.\n- Proposition H (incommensurability clause): it currently asserts incommensurability \u201cif s is rational.\u201d The algebra shows more: if \u03b2 is irrational then for any s\u2208(0,1), \u03b2/(\u03b2\u2212s)\u2208Q implies \u03b2\u2208Q unless p=q (which would force s=0). So the periods are incommensurable for all s\u2208(0,1) (rational or irrational). The non-column hypothesis s\u2209{1/m} is separate.\n\n## New small lemmas (auditable, to strengthen and extend the record)\n\n1) Sufficiency for Lemma C (singleton, fixed order produces a tiling).\n- Statement. Suppose K={k_1,\u2026,k_\u2113} with 1\u2208K, lengths c_i>0, \u2211 c_i=1, a_i\u2208S^1, and a cyclic order \u03c3. If \u03b2\u2208S^1 satisfies (k_i\u2212k_{\u03c3(i)})\u03b2 \u2261 a_i+c_i\u2212a_{\u03c3(i)} for all i, then for any \u03b8_0 the sequence \u03b8_n:=\u03b8_0+n\u03b2 produces, at each row m, an a.e. disjoint \u03c3-ordered partition of S^1 by the arcs [a_i+\u03b8_{m\u2212k_i}, a_i+\u03b8_{m\u2212k_i}+c_i].\n- Proof sketch. Define c_{\u03c3(1)}:=0 and c_{\u03c3(j+1)}:=c_{\u03c3(j)}+c_{\u03c3(j)} (cumulative along \u03c3) so that c_{\u03c3(\u2113+1)}\u22611. For row m, set \u03c6_m:=\u03b8_{m\u2212k_{\u03c3(1)}}\u2212c_{\u03c3(1)}+a_{\u03c3(1)}. The congruences ensure \u03b8_{m\u2212k_{\u03c3(j+1)}} \u2261 \u03b8_{m\u2212k_{\u03c3(j)}} + (a_{\u03c3(j)}+c_{\u03c3(j)}\u2212a_{\u03c3(j+1)}) (mod 1), hence the right endpoint of the j-th arc equals the left endpoint of the (j+1)-st arc, cycling back after \u2113 steps. The arcs meet end-to-end and have total length 1, hence they a.e. partition S^1.\n\n2) Rigidity of fiber cardinalities for Theorem A-type tiles.\n- Setting. K={0,1}, J_1:=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1) and A=({0}\u00d7J_0)\u222a({1}\u00d7J_1). Assume J_0 does not admit any m-fold translational tiling of S^1 for m\u2208{2} (i.e., there is no \u03b4 with J_0 \u2294 (J_0+\u03b4) = S^1 a.e.).\n- Claim. In any tiling A+T=Z\u00d7S^1, one must have |T_n|=1 for all n.\n- Proof sketch (|J_0|=|J_1|=1/2 case). Let d_n:=|T_n|. The per-row measure identity yields d_n+d_{n\u22121}=2 for all n. If some n has d_n=2, then d_{n\u22121}=0 and row n is covered solely by two disjoint translates of J_0, contradicting the no-2-fold-tiling hypothesis. Similarly, d_n=0 is impossible. Hence d_n=1 for all n.\n- Use. This strengthens irreducibility (every tiling for such A is singleton) and closes a potential loophole in uniqueness of fiber sizes.\n\n3) Quick incommensurability check in Proposition H (clarified, no rationality of s needed).\n- If \u03b2 is irrational and \u03b2\u2032\u2261\u03b2\u2212s, s\u2208(0,1), then \u03b2/\u03b2\u2032\u2208Q \u21d2 (q\u2212p)\u03b2=\u2212ps \u2208 Q with p/q=\u03b2/\u03b2\u2032 \u21d2 \u03b2\u2208Q unless p=q (forcing s=0). Thus incommensurability holds for any s\u2208(0,1).\n\n## Examples (sanity checks)\n\n- Theorem A instance. Take U=[0,0.2]\u222a[0.3,0.35] and \u03b1=\u221a2/10. Then J_0:=U\u222a(U+1/2), J_1:=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1). On row 0, choose \u03b8_0=0; the two sets are J_0 and S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1)=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b8_0+\u03b1), complementary a.e. Irreducibility holds, and non-column follows either from d_n+d_{n\u22121}=2 and the 2-fold-tiling obstruction (component-lengths), or from Lemma E at the left boundary combined with the Fourier obstruction if |J_0|=1/2.\n- K={0,1,2} two-order instance. c_1=c_3=2/5, c_2=1/5, \u03b2=\u221a2/10, a_1=0, a_2\u2261a_1+c_1+\u03b2, a_3\u2261a_1+c_1+c_2+2\u03b2. Then \u03c3=(1\u21922\u21923\u21921) works with slope \u03b2; \u03c3\u2032 works with \u03b2\u2032\u2261\u03b2\u22122/5. By Lemma E, A is not a column; irreducible as \u27e8K\u2212K\u27e9=Z.\n\n## Obstacles and open tasks\n\n- For Lemma 2 in \u201cRigidity of fiber cardinalities,\u201d a general statement (|J_0| arbitrary, prohibiting any m-fold translational tiling for m near 1/|J_0|) would cover more cases. The Fourier constraint (from previous notes) provides a practical test when |J_0|=1/m: if two even Fourier modes of 1_{J_0} are nonzero and incompatible with the same \u03b4-system, no 2-fold partition exists.\n- Classification question: For the complementary 2-layer tiles, are the helical tilings T_{\u03b1+j/q} the only tilings (up to null sets), under mild anti-m-tiling hypotheses on J_0? The d_n-identity and the complement structure suggest a rigidity theorem; a full proof would track phase-sets, not only counts.\n\n## Next steps (concrete, checkable additions to output.md)\n\n1) Append the sufficiency half of Lemma C as \u201cLemma C\u2019\u201d (above) with its short proof.\n2) Add the \u201crigidity of fiber cardinalities\u201d lemma for Theorem A-type tiles (|J_0|=1/2) to conclude that any tiling must be singleton; this reinforces irreducibility and rules out exotic d_n patterns.\n3) Strengthen Proposition H\u2019s incommensurability statement to remove the extra hypothesis \u201cs rational.\u201d\n4) Optionally incorporate the Fourier obstruction as a separate lemma to handle the |J_0|=1/m cases uniformly.\n\nThese are all incremental, auditable improvements that either close small gaps (equivalence in Lemma C) or add robustness (rigidity and incommensurability clarifications)."
