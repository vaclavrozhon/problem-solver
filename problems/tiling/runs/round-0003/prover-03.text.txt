The current proof sketches necessity (matching endpoints in a fixed cyclic order yields the congruences). To justify equivalence, one should prove: if β and the a_i satisfy (k_i−k_{σ(i)})β ≡ a_i+c_i−a_{σ(i)} (mod 1), then defining θ_n:=θ_0+nβ produces, for each row m, a phase φ_m with θ_{m−k_i} = φ_m + c_i − a_i and the σ-adjacency equalities, hence a valid end-to-end partition of S^1 by the intervals [a_i+θ_{m−k_i}, a_i+θ_{m−k_i}+c_i]. This is a straightforward check but should be inserted to fully justify “equivalent.”\n- Theorem A(iii) (non-column): the step “Because X is finite, d_n=0 for all sufficiently large |n|” is true but could be tightened. For K={0,1}, any anchor z contributes to rows z and z+1. If X is finite with p:=min X and q:=max X, then necessarily T_z=∅ unless z∈[p−1,q], hence d_n=0 for n<p−1 and n>q. This explicit localisation can be cited before deducing d_{p−1}=0 and d_p=2.\n- Endpoint convention for J_1: The remark at the end covers this, but it may help to explicitly state in Theorem A that J_1 can be chosen as a finite union of closed arcs differing from S^1\\(J_0+α) on a null set, keeping within the tile format.\n- Proposition D: the explicit algebra is given in the “Supplement,” which is excellent. To align with Lemma C’s “equivalence,” it would be good to add a one-liner that, conversely, these congruences ensure the σ and σ′ partitions exist with θ_n=θ_0+nβ and θ′_n=θ′_0+nβ′.\n- Proposition H (incommensurability clause): it currently asserts incommensurability “if s is rational.” The algebra shows more: if β is irrational then for any s∈(0,1), β/(β−s)∈Q implies β∈Q unless p=q (which would force s=0). So the periods are incommensurable for all s∈(0,1) (rational or irrational). The non-column hypothesis s∉{1/m} is separate.\n\n## New small lemmas (auditable, to strengthen and extend the record)\n\n1) Sufficiency for Lemma C (singleton, fixed order produces a tiling).\n- Statement. Suppose K={k_1,…,k_ℓ} with 1∈K, lengths c_i>0, ∑ c_i=1, a_i∈S^1, and a cyclic order σ. If β∈S^1 satisfies (k_i−k_{σ(i)})β ≡ a_i+c_i−a_{σ(i)} for all i, then for any θ_0 the sequence θ_n:=θ_0+nβ produces, at each row m, an a.e. disjoint σ-ordered partition of S^1 by the arcs [a_i+θ_{m−k_i}, a_i+θ_{m−k_i}+c_i].\n- Proof sketch. Define c_{σ(1)}:=0 and c_{σ(j+1)}:=c_{σ(j)}+c_{σ(j)} (cumulative along σ) so that c_{σ(ℓ+1)}≡1. For row m, set φ_m:=θ_{m−k_{σ(1)}}−c_{σ(1)}+a_{σ(1)}. The congruences ensure θ_{m−k_{σ(j+1)}} ≡ θ_{m−k_{σ(j)}} + (a_{σ(j)}+c_{σ(j)}−a_{σ(j+1)}) (mod 1), hence the right endpoint of the j-th arc equals the left endpoint of the (j+1)-st arc, cycling back after ℓ steps. The arcs meet end-to-end and have total length 1, hence they a.e. partition S^1.\n\n2) Rigidity of fiber cardinalities for Theorem A-type tiles.\n- Setting. K={0,1}, J_1:=S^1\\(J_0+α) and A=({0}×J_0)∪({1}×J_1). Assume J_0 does not admit any m-fold translational tiling of S^1 for m∈{2} (i.e., there is no δ with J_0 ⊔ (J_0+δ) = S^1 a.e.).\n- Claim. In any tiling A+T=Z×S^1, one must have |T_n|=1 for all n.\n- Proof sketch (|J_0|=|J_1|=1/2 case). Let d_n:=|T_n|. The per-row measure identity yields d_n+d_{n−1}=2 for all n. If some n has d_n=2, then d_{n−1}=0 and row n is covered solely by two disjoint translates of J_0, contradicting the no-2-fold-tiling hypothesis. Similarly, d_n=0 is impossible. Hence d_n=1 for all n.\n- Use. This strengthens irreducibility (every tiling for such A is singleton) and closes a potential loophole in uniqueness of fiber sizes.\n\n3) Quick incommensurability check in Proposition H (clarified, no rationality of s needed).\n- If β is irrational and β′≡β−s, s∈(0,1), then β/β′∈Q ⇒ (q−p)β=−ps ∈ Q with p/q=β/β′ ⇒ β∈Q unless p=q (forcing s=0). Thus incommensurability holds for any s∈(0,1).\n\n## Examples (sanity checks)\n\n- Theorem A instance. Take U=[0,0.2]∪[0.3,0.35] and α=√2/10. Then J_0:=U∪(U+1/2), J_1:=S^1\\(J_0+α). On row 0, choose θ_0=0; the two sets are J_0 and S^1\\(J_0+α)=S^1\\(J_0+θ_0+α), complementary a.e. Irreducibility holds, and non-column follows either from d_n+d_{n−1}=2 and the 2-fold-tiling obstruction (component-lengths), or from Lemma E at the left boundary combined with the Fourier obstruction if |J_0|=1/2.\n- K={0,1,2} two-order instance. c_1=c_3=2/5, c_2=1/5, β=√2/10, a_1=0, a_2≡a_1+c_1+β, a_3≡a_1+c_1+c_2+2β. Then σ=(1→2→3→1) works with slope β; σ′ works with β′≡β−2/5. By Lemma E, A is not a column; irreducible as ⟨K−K⟩=Z.\n\n## Obstacles and open tasks\n\n- For Lemma 2 in “Rigidity of fiber cardinalities,” a general statement (|J_0| arbitrary, prohibiting any m-fold translational tiling for m near 1/|J_0|) would cover more cases. The Fourier constraint (from previous notes) provides a practical test when |J_0|=1/m: if two even Fourier modes of 1_{J_0} are nonzero and incompatible with the same δ-system, no 2-fold partition exists.\n- Classification question: For the complementary 2-layer tiles, are the helical tilings T_{α+j/q} the only tilings (up to null sets), under mild anti-m-tiling hypotheses on J_0? The d_n-identity and the complement structure suggest a rigidity theorem; a full proof would track phase-sets, not only counts.\n\n## Next steps (concrete, checkable additions to output.md)\n\n1) Append the sufficiency half of Lemma C as “Lemma C’” (above) with its short proof.\n2) Add the “rigidity of fiber cardinalities” lemma for Theorem A-type tiles (|J_0|=1/2) to conclude that any tiling must be singleton; this reinforces irreducibility and rules out exotic d_n patterns.\n3) Strengthen Proposition H’s incommensurability statement to remove the extra hypothesis “s rational.”\n4) Optionally incorporate the Fourier obstruction as a separate lemma to handle the |J_0|=1/m cases uniformly.\n\nThese are all incremental, auditable improvements that either close small gaps (equivalence in Lemma C) or add robustness (rigidity and incommensurability clarifications)."}
