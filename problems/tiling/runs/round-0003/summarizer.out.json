  "summary_md": "Round 0003 audit and tightenings: the three reports confirm Theorem A and Proposition H are correct and add several small, auditable lemmas that strengthen and close gaps. Key additions: a gcd-necessity lemma (reducibility when gcd(K\u2212K)>1), an explicit closure step for Lemma B, a one-line rational-shift incommensurability lemma, and (crucially) Lemma 1 + Corollary 2 showing that for the complementary two-layer construction every tiling is singleton-per-row and that row increments lie in \u03b1+Stab(J_0) (hence in \u03b1+(1/q)Z when J_0 is 1/q-periodic). Prover 03 supplies the sufficiency half of Lemma C (congruences \u21d2 helical tilings) and tightens incommensurability claims for the K={0,1,2} family. Remaining work: prove increment-constancy (rigidity) to classify all tilings and formalize the Fourier obstruction for |J_0|=1/m corner cases. Verifier verdict: partial success. Sources: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json, prover-03.out.json.",

    "Singleton-per-row rigidity (Lemma 1): every tiling of A=({0}\u00d7J_0)\u222a({1}\u00d7J_1) with J_1=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1) has d_n=d_{n\u22121}=1 for all n, so fiber sizes are fixed and irreducibility follows once gcd(K\u2212K)=1.",
    "Row-increment constraint (Corollary 2): \u03b8_m\u2212\u03b8_{m\u22121} \u2208 \u03b1 + Stab(J_0); if J_0 is 1/q-periodic (no finer invariance) increments lie in \u03b1+(1/q)Z, explaining the q helical periods in Proposition G.",
    "Gcd-necessity lemma (complements Lemma B): if g:=gcd{ k_i\u2212k_j }>1 then any tiling decomposes along residue classes mod g and is reducible.",
    "Proposition H completed and improved: the K={0,1,2} two-order mechanism now has a clean non-column boundary proof, and incommensurability of the two periods holds without assuming s rational (irrational \u03b2 suffices).",
    "Lemma C sufficiency recorded: the congruence system (k_i\u2212k_{\u03c3(i)})\u03b2 \u2261 a_i+c_i\u2212a_{\u03c3(i)} (mod 1) does produce the \u03c3-ordered helical tilings (\u03b8_n=\u03b8_0+n\u03b2); add this short proof to output.md.",
    "Corner cases flagged: add the explicit closure step to Lemma B in the text and formalize the Fourier/complement obstruction to forbid m\u2011fold partitions when |J_0|=1/m."
