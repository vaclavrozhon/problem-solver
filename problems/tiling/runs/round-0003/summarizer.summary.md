Round 0003 audit and tightenings: the three reports confirm Theorem A and Proposition H are correct and add several small, auditable lemmas that strengthen and close gaps. Key additions: a gcd-necessity lemma (reducibility when gcd(K−K)>1), an explicit closure step for Lemma B, a one-line rational-shift incommensurability lemma, and (crucially) Lemma 1 + Corollary 2 showing that for the complementary two-layer construction every tiling is singleton-per-row and that row increments lie in α+Stab(J_0) (hence in α+(1/q)Z when J_0 is 1/q-periodic). Prover 03 supplies the sufficiency half of Lemma C (congruences ⇒ helical tilings) and tightens incommensurability claims for the K={0,1,2} family. Remaining work: prove increment-constancy (rigidity) to classify all tilings and formalize the Fourier obstruction for |J_0|=1/m corner cases. Verifier verdict: partial success.
