  "summary_md": "Round 0003 audit and tightenings: the three reports confirm Theorem A and Proposition H are correct and add several small, auditable lemmas that strengthen and close gaps. Key additions: a gcd-necessity lemma (reducibility when gcd(K−K)>1), an explicit closure step for Lemma B, a one-line rational-shift incommensurability lemma, and (crucially) Lemma 1 + Corollary 2 showing that for the complementary two-layer construction every tiling is singleton-per-row and that row increments lie in α+Stab(J_0) (hence in α+(1/q)Z when J_0 is 1/q-periodic). Prover 03 supplies the sufficiency half of Lemma C (congruences ⇒ helical tilings) and tightens incommensurability claims for the K={0,1,2} family. Remaining work: prove increment-constancy (rigidity) to classify all tilings and formalize the Fourier obstruction for |J_0|=1/m corner cases. Verifier verdict: partial success. Sources: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json, prover-03.out.json.",
  "highlights": [
    "Singleton-per-row rigidity (Lemma 1): every tiling of A=({0}×J_0)∪({1}×J_1) with J_1=S^1\\(J_0+α) has d_n=d_{n−1}=1 for all n, so fiber sizes are fixed and irreducibility follows once gcd(K−K)=1.",
    "Row-increment constraint (Corollary 2): θ_m−θ_{m−1} ∈ α + Stab(J_0); if J_0 is 1/q-periodic (no finer invariance) increments lie in α+(1/q)Z, explaining the q helical periods in Proposition G.",
    "Gcd-necessity lemma (complements Lemma B): if g:=gcd{ k_i−k_j }>1 then any tiling decomposes along residue classes mod g and is reducible.",
    "Proposition H completed and improved: the K={0,1,2} two-order mechanism now has a clean non-column boundary proof, and incommensurability of the two periods holds without assuming s rational (irrational β suffices).",
    "Lemma C sufficiency recorded: the congruence system (k_i−k_{σ(i)})β ≡ a_i+c_i−a_{σ(i)} (mod 1) does produce the σ-ordered helical tilings (θ_n=θ_0+nβ); add this short proof to output.md.",
    "Corner cases flagged: add the explicit closure step to Lemma B in the text and formalize the Fourier/complement obstruction to forbid m‑fold partitions when |J_0|=1/m."

    "Prove rigidity: show θ_m−θ_{m−1} is constant (mod 1/q) for complementary two-layer tiles with 1/q-periodic J_0 (start with q=2) to conclude the q helical tilings are the only tilings a.e.",
    "Insert the explicit closure argument for Lemma B and the gcd‑necessity lemma into output.md so irreducibility statements are fully justified (short, auditable additions).",
    "Formalize the Fourier/complement obstruction that rules out m‑fold translational partitions of J_0 (|J_0|=1/m) and add it as a uniform tool to handle the remaining non-column corner cases."
