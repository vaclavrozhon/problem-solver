  "feedback_md": "Overall, there is solid progress plus a few gaps that need careful correction.\n\nWhat is solid and incorporated:\n- Prover 01\u2019s \u201cgcd necessity\u201d lemma (if H:=\u27e8K\u2212K\u27e9\u2260Z then any tiling splits by residues modulo g) is correct, short, and completes the singleton irreducibility picture into a necessary-and-sufficient condition in general. We add it to output.md.\n- The explicit closure step for Lemma B is good and removes ambiguity in the current sketch. We fully write it out in output.md.\n- The rational-shift incommensurability lemma (if \u03b1\u2209Q and r\u2208Q\\{0} then \u03b1/(\u03b1+r)\u2209Q) is correct; we record a slightly more general version (for any a\u2260b in Q: (\u03b1+a)/(\u03b1+b)\u2209Q) which directly covers Proposition G\u2019s incommensurability.\n- Prover 03\u2019s request to add the sufficiency half of Lemma C is well taken. We include a clean sufficiency argument: the congruences force end-to-end adjacency in the fixed cyclic order, yielding a partition of S^1 at every row with slope \u03b2.\n- For Theorem A-type tiles (|J_0|=1/2 and J_1=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1)), we add a rigorous \u201cfiber-cardinality rigidity\u201d lemma: assuming J_0 does not admit a two-translate partition of S^1, any tiling must have |T_n|=1 for all n. This closes the possibility of exotic d-patterns in the complementary construction used in Theorem A.\n\nGaps and corrections:\n- Prover 02\u2019s Lemma 1 (claiming d_m=d_{m\u22121}=1 for every tiling of the complementary two-layer construction without further hypotheses) is too strong as stated. The key step only proves that if d_{m\u22121}\u22651 then d_m\u22641, and symmetrically if d_{m}\u22651 then d_{m\u22121}\u22641; but it does not rule out the 0/2 degeneracy without an extra hypothesis (e.g., forbidding two-translate tilings of J_0 or J_1). We therefore do not add Lemma 1 as stated. Instead we add the |J_0|=1/2 rigidity lemma that leverages the \u201cno two-translate tiling\u201d condition (which Theorem A already enforces by construction).\n- Prover 02\u2019s Lemma 3 relies on \u201cgeneric\u201d obstructions (component-lengths/Fourier) and is not a general statement; we keep it in the notes as a tool but do not claim it as a theorem.\n- Prover 03\u2019s proposed strengthening of Proposition H\u2019s incommensurability (\u201cno rationality of s needed\u201d) is false in general: e.g., \u03b2=\u221a2 and s=\u03b2/2 give \u03b2/(\u03b2\u2212s)=2\u2208Q. Thus, we retain the rationality-of-s hypothesis in Prop. H\u2019s incommensurability clause. We record this counterexample in the notes.\n\nCleanups and consistency:\n- We update the Summary at the top of output.md: the K={0,1,2} two-order family is no longer \u201cpending non-column\u201d; Proposition H completes it.\n- We add a remark pointing out that Theorem A\u2019s non-column proof can alternatively invoke the boundary obstruction (Corollary F) by choosing |J_0|\u2209{1/m}, avoiding the component-length argument.\n\nNext steps (concrete and testable):\n1) Classification for the complementary construction. Under a mild \u201cno two-translate\u201d (|J_0|\u22601/m or use Fourier obstruction) and a minimal-period assumption (J_0 has only 1/q translational invariance), aim to show the row increment \u03b8_m\u2212\u03b8_{m\u22121} is constant modulo 1/q. Plan: use the identity U_m=\u22c2_{\u03b8\u2208T_{m\u22121}}(J_0+\u03b1+\u03b8), the singleton-per-row consequence, and compare consecutive rows to show any variation in the 1/q-offset generates overlaps contradicting disjointness.\n2) Fourier two-copy obstruction. Formalize and add the \u201ctwo disjoint translates cannot tile S^1\u201d lemma (already sketched) as a general tool for |J_0|=1/2 or more generally |J_0|=1/m, thereby closing remaining corner cases uniformly.\n3) Extend the multi-order mechanism to other K (e.g. {0,1,3}) using the Lemma C congruence framework; seek simultaneous order compatibilities and then enforce non-column via Lemma E.\n4) Numerical verification scripts (sanity checks) for the examples: endpoint matching per row, a.e. disjointness, period transport T_{n+1}=T_n+\u03b1 (or \u03b1+j/q), and boundary obstruction integrality conditions.\n",
  "new_notes_md": "Updates, corrections, and new tools\n\n1) On the \u201ccomplementary two-layer\u201d structure A=({0}\u00d7J_0)\u222a({1}\u00d7J_1) with J_1=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1)\n- Intersection identity. For any tiling A+T and row m, writing U_m:=\u22c3_{\u03b8\u2208T_m}(J_0+\u03b8) and V_m:=\u22c3_{\u03b8\u2208T_{m\u22121}}(J_1+\u03b8), we have U_m\u2294V_m=S^1 a.e. and\n  V_m = \u22c3_{\u03b8\u2208T_{m\u22121}} (S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1+\u03b8)) = S^1 \\ \u22c2_{\u03b8\u2208T_{m\u22121}} (J_0+\u03b1+\u03b8).\n  Hence U_m = \u22c2_{\u03b8\u2208T_{m\u22121}} (J_0+\u03b1+\u03b8) a.e. In particular, if d_{m\u22121}:=|T_{m\u22121}|\u22651 then |U_m|\u2264|J_0|, which implies d_m\u22641 (since U_m is a disjoint union of d_m translates of J_0). A symmetric statement holds one step forward: if d_m\u22651 then d_{m+1}\u22641.\n- Degeneracy (0/2) is not excluded without extra hypotheses. For |J_0|=|J_1|=1/2, the per-row identity is d_m+d_{m\u22121}=2. The pattern (\u2026,2,0,2,0,\u2026) is compatible with this identity; ruling it out requires forbidding two-translate tilings of J_0 (and hence of J_1). Our Theorem A already enforces this (via component-length mismatch). Under this \u201cno two-translate\u201d hypothesis we can prove d_m=1 for all m (see new Proposition I in output.md).\n\n2) Irreducibility and gcd(K\u2212K)\n- Necessity. If H:=\u27e8K\u2212K\u27e9\u2260Z (say gcd g>1), any tiling splits along residue classes modulo g: for T^{(r)}:={ (z,\u03b8)\u2208T : z\u2261r (mod g) } one has A+T^{(r)} = X_r\u00d7S^1 a.e. where X_r:=gZ+r, and the union over r is disjoint. Thus H=Z is necessary for irreducibility, not only in the singleton regime.\n- Sufficiency in the singleton case. We include the full closure argument: if T=T_1\u2294T_2 yields A+T_i=X_i\u00d7S^1, then from m\u2208X_1 all m\u2212k_i\u2208X_1, hence X_1 is a union of cosets of H. If H=Z, X_1 is \u2205 or Z.\n\n3) Singleton with fixed cyclic order: equivalence (Lemma C)\n- We now record the sufficiency half: if \u03b2 and the a_i satisfy (k_i\u2212k_{\u03c3(i)})\u03b2\u2261a_i+c_i\u2212a_{\u03c3(i)} (mod 1), then \u03b8_n:=\u03b8_0+n\u03b2 produces, at each row m, \u2113 arcs that meet end-to-end in the \u03c3-order and (since \u2211c_i=1) a.e. partition S^1.\n\n4) Incommensurability tools\n- General rational-shift test. If \u03b1\u2209Q and a\u2260b\u2208Q, then (\u03b1+a)/(\u03b1+b)\u2209Q. In particular, if \u03b1\u2209Q and r\u2208Q\\{0}, then \u03b1/(\u03b1+r)\u2209Q. This packages the algebra used repeatedly in Theorem A and Prop. G.\n- Caution (Prop. H). The statement \u201c\u03b2/(\u03b2\u2212s)\u2209Q for all s\u2208(0,1)\u201d is false without assuming s\u2208Q; e.g., \u03b2=\u221a2 and s=\u03b2/2 give \u03b2/(\u03b2\u2212s)=2\u2208Q. We retain the hypothesis s rational in the incommensurability clause of Prop. H.\n\n5) Fourier two-copy obstruction (record)\n- If E+\u03b4=S^1\\E a.e., then for every t\u22600 with \\hat{1_E}(t)\u22600 we have e^{2\u03c0it\u03b4}=\u22121. This is useful to forbid two-translate tilings when |E|=1/2 (or more generally |E|=1/m), and underpins the \u201cno two-translate\u201d hypothesis.\n\n6) Next targets (rigidity and classification)\n- Under J_0 with only 1/q-translational invariance, prove that any complementary two-layer tiling must have constant increment \u03b8_m\u2212\u03b8_{m\u22121} modulo 1/q; hence classify all tilings as the q helical ones from Prop. G. Strategy: use the intersection identity row-to-row and endpoint propagation to show that varying the 1/q offset produces overlaps.\n- Systematically extend the multi-order mechanism beyond K={0,1,2}, again leveraging Lemma C and boundary obstruction Lemma E.\n",

  "new_outputs_md": "Summary of proven results and why they matter\n- Main existence theorem (Theorem A). We construct an explicit tile A\u2282Z\u00d7S^1 that is not a column yet admits two irreducible tilings with periods (1,\u03b1) and (1,\u03b1+1/2), with \u03b1 irrational; these two periods are incommensurable. This positively settles the core existence question.\n- General structure for singleton tilings. We record a concise congruence system that characterizes singleton-per-row tilings with a fixed cyclic order, now with both necessity and sufficiency, and an irreducibility criterion. We also prove that gcd(K\u2212K)=1 is not only sufficient (in the singleton setting) but that gcd(K\u2212K)>1 forces reducibility in general.\n- Complementary two-layer family: q-phase generalization. If J_0 has 1/q-periodicity, the complementary construction yields q singleton tilings with incommensurable vertical periods (1,\u03b1+j/q). A quick boundary test certifies non-columnity whenever |J_0|\u2209{1/m}.\n- Two-order mechanism for K={0,1,2} completed. When c_1=c_3, a single tile admits two distinct singleton tilings corresponding to the cyclic orders (1\u21922\u21923\u21921) and (1\u21923\u21922\u21921); the slopes differ by c_1 modulo 1. Non-columnity follows from the boundary obstruction when c_1\u2209{1/m}. If c_1 is rational and the slope is irrational, the two periods are incommensurable.\n- Rigidity for Theorem A-type tiles. For the complementary two-layer tiles with |J_0|=1/2 that do not admit a two-translate partition of S^1, every tiling is automatically singleton-per-row. This streamlines irreducibility and supports further classification.\n\nTheorem A (Non-column tile with two incommensurable periods). Fix an irrational \u03b1\u2208(0,1/2). Let U\u2282S^1 be a finite union of disjoint intervals of total length 1/4 such that U\u2229(U+1/2)=\u2205 and the multiset of lengths of connected components of U is different from that of its complement in [0,1/2). Define J_0:=U\u222a(U+1/2) (so |J_0|=1/2 and J_0+1/2=J_0), J_1:=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1), and set A:=( {0}\u00d7J_0 ) \u222a ( {1}\u00d7J_1 ). Then:\n(i) There is a tiling T_\u03b1 with period (1,\u03b1), and a tiling T_{\u03b1+1/2} with period (1,\u03b1+1/2).\n(ii) Both tilings are irreducible.\n(iii) A is not a column (i.e., there is no finite X\u2282Z and T\u2282Z\u00d7S^1 with A+T=X\u00d7S^1).\n(iv) The periods are incommensurable: \u03b1/(\u03b1+1/2)\u2209Q.\nProof. (i)\u2013(iv) As in the previous version; we only note that (iii) can also be deduced from Corollary F by instead choosing |J_0|\u2209{1/m}, in which case the boundary obstruction immediately rules out finite-column tilings. \u220e\n\nLemma B (Irreducibility for singleton tilings with gcd(K\u2212K)=1). Let A have layers at K={k_1,\u2026,k_\u2113} and suppose |T_n|=1 for all n (singleton). Let H:=\u27e8K\u2212K\u27e9\u2264Z. If H=Z then any tiling is irreducible.\nProof. Assume a decomposition T=T_1\u2294T_2 such that A+T_i=X_i\u00d7S^1 with Z=X_1\u2294X_2 disjoint. Fix m\u2208X_1. In row m the contributing anchors are exactly at indices m\u2212k_i (one per i). If for some i we had m\u2212k_i\u2209X_1, then the corresponding interval [a_i+\u03b8_{m\u2212k_i},b_i+\u03b8_{m\u2212k_i}] would belong to A+T_2 and yet lie inside row m\u2208X_1, contradicting A+T_1=X_1\u00d7S^1. Hence m\u2212k_i\u2208X_1 for all i, so X_1 is closed under subtraction by each k_i, hence under \u00b1(K\u2212K). Therefore X_1 is a union of cosets of H. If H=Z, only \u2205 and Z occur, proving irreducibility. \u220e\n\nLemma B\u2032 (Reducibility when gcd(K\u2212K)>1). Let H:=\u27e8K\u2212K\u27e9 and suppose H\u2260Z, with index g:=[Z:H]>1. For r=0,1,\u2026,g\u22121 let T^{(r)}:={ (z,\u03b8)\u2208T : z\u2261r (mod g) } and X_r:=gZ+r. Then A+T^{(r)}=X_r\u00d7S^1 a.e., and thus A+T is reducible into g disjoint tilings along residue classes mod g.\nProof. A translate anchored at z contributes only to rows z+k_i, each \u2261z (mod g). Hence only anchors with z\u2261r can contribute to rows in X_r, and conversely all coverage of a row m\u2208X_r comes from T^{(r)}. Disjointness across distinct r is automatic since they occupy disjoint rows. \u220e\n\nLemma C (Singleton congruences under a fixed cyclic order: necessity and sufficiency). Assume |T_n|=1 and that on every row the \u2113 intervals appear in the same cyclic order \u03c3 and meet end-to-end. Let c_i:=b_i\u2212a_i and \u03b2:=\u03b8_n\u2212\u03b8_{n\u22121} (mod 1). Then the adjacency constraints are equivalent to the congruence system\n  (k_i \u2212 k_{\u03c3(i)}) \u03b2 \u2261 a_i + c_i \u2212 a_{\u03c3(i)}  (mod 1),  i=1,\u2026,\u2113.\nProof. Necessity: matching the right endpoint of i with the left endpoint of \u03c3(i) and using \u03b8_{m\u2212k_i}\u2212\u03b8_{m\u2212k_{\u03c3(i)}}=(k_{\u03c3(i)}\u2212k_i)\u03b2 gives the displayed congruences. Sufficiency: Given \u03b2 solving these congruences, define \u03b8_n:=\u03b8_0+n\u03b2. At row m put intervals I_i:=[a_i+\u03b8_{m\u2212k_i}, a_i+\u03b8_{m\u2212k_i}+c_i]. The congruences read a_i+\u03b8_{m\u2212k_i}+c_i \u2261 a_{\u03c3(i)}+\u03b8_{m\u2212k_{\u03c3(i)}}, so the right endpoint of I_i equals the left endpoint of I_{\u03c3(i)}. Summing lengths gives \u2211_i|I_i|=\u2211_ic_i=1. Thus the I_i meet end-to-end around the circle in the \u03c3-order and (apart from endpoints) are disjoint, forming an a.e. partition of S^1. \u220e\n\nLemma E (Boundary obstruction to finite-column tilings). [As before.] \u220e\n\nCorollary F (Quick non-column test for two-layer tiles). [As before.] \u220e\n\nProposition G (q-phase generalization of the complementary 2-layer construction). [As before; incommensurability follows from the rational-shift Lemma R below by taking a=j/q, b=j\u2032/q.] \u220e\n\nProposition H (Completion of the K={0,1,2} two-order mechanism: non-column family with two incommensurable periods). Let K=(0,1,2) and c_i=b_i\u2212a_i>0 with c_1+c_2+c_3=1. Assume c_1=c_3=s and s\u2209{1/m: m\u2208N}. Then there exist endpoints a_1,a_2,a_3 and an irrational slope \u03b2 such that the tile A:=\u22c3_{i=1}^3({k_i}\u00d7[a_i,b_i]) admits two distinct singleton tilings corresponding to the cyclic orders \u03c3=(1\u21922\u21923\u21921) and \u03c3\u2032=(1\u21923\u21922\u21921), with slopes \u03b2 and \u03b2\u2032\u2261\u03b2\u2212s (mod 1), respectively. Both tilings are irreducible, their periods are incommensurable if s is rational, and A is not a column.\nProof. As before: Lemma C and its supplement give existence; Lemma B yields irreducibility (\u27e8K\u2212K\u27e9=Z). If s\u2208Q and \u03b2\u2209Q, then \u03b2/\u03b2\u2032\u2208Q would force \u03b2\u2208Q. Non-column follows from Lemma E at k=0 and k=2 since 1/s\u2209N. \u220e\n\nSupplement to Proposition D (explicit algebra). [As before.] \u220e\n\nProposition I (Singleton rigidity for the |J_0|=1/2 complementary tiles). Let A=({0}\u00d7J_0)\u222a({1}\u00d7J_1) with J_1=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1) and |J_0|=|J_1|=1/2. Assume J_0 does not admit a two-translate partition of S^1 (i.e., there is no \u03b4 with J_0 \u2294 (J_0+\u03b4)=S^1 a.e.). Then every tiling A+T=Z\u00d7S^1 satisfies |T_n|=1 for all n.\nProof. Let d_n:=|T_n|. The per-row measure identity gives d_n+d_{n\u22121}=2 for all n. If d_n=2 for some n, then d_{n\u22121}=0 and row n is covered solely by two disjoint translates of J_0, contradicting the hypothesis. Similarly, d_n=0 is impossible. Hence d_n=1 for all n. \u220e\n\nCorollary J (Row-to-row increment constraint in the complementary case). In the setting of Proposition I, writing T_n={\u03b8_n}, for every m we have J_0+\u03b8_m = J_0+(\u03b1+\u03b8_{m\u22121}) a.e. Hence \u03b8_m\u2212\u03b8_{m\u22121}\u2212\u03b1\u2208Stab(J_0):={t\u2208S^1 : J_0+t=J_0 a.e.}. In particular, if J_0 has 1/q-periodicity and no finer translational invariance, then \u03b8_m\u2212\u03b8_{m\u22121}\u2208\u03b1+(1/q)Z for all m.\nProof. From U_m=\u22c3_{\u03b8\u2208T_m}(J_0+\u03b8) and U_m=S^1\\V_m with V_m=\u22c3_{\u03b8\u2208T_{m\u22121}}(J_1+\u03b8), Proposition I gives d_m=d_{m\u22121}=1, so U_m=J_0+\u03b8_m and also U_m=J_0+(\u03b1+\u03b8_{m\u22121}). Thus J_0+\u03b8_m=J_0+(\u03b1+\u03b8_{m\u22121}) a.e. The stabilizer conclusion follows immediately. \u220e\n\nLemma R (Rational-shift incommensurability). If \u03b1\u2209Q and a\u2260b\u2208Q, then (\u03b1+a)/(\u03b1+b)\u2209Q. In particular, if \u03b1\u2209Q and r\u2208Q\\{0}, then \u03b1/(\u03b1+r)\u2209Q.\nProof. If (\u03b1+a)/(\u03b1+b)=p/q\u2208Q, then \u03b1+a=(p/q)(\u03b1+b), so (1\u2212p/q)\u03b1=(p/q)b\u2212a\u2208Q. Since a\u2260b, 1\u2212p/q\u22600, hence \u03b1\u2208Q, a contradiction. The special case takes b=0 and a=r. \u220e\n\nRemark on endpoint conventions.
