You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md and output.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers
- notes.md (summary so far)
- output.md (rigorously proven results so far)

Guidelines:
- notes.md: should be a readable running log of interesting work. Prefer appending. Replace only if old notes are clearly misleading. Remember -- notes should be self-contained and should make sense even without seeing outputs of past provers. 
- output.md:  Think twice before you add something to this file. Everything here should be rigorous, almost publication-ready. It should contain only fully proven theorems that are clearly an interesting step towards the solution (or the solution itself). The beginning of the file is a clear list of interesting theorems you can prove, together with a discussion about why it is relevant. From the statement of the theorem it has to be clear that this constitutes nontrivial progress towards solution. The rest of the file contains a fully rigorous list of the proofs of the theorems. Keep only proven theorems with clear proofs. If a statement in that file is flawed / unprecise and you cannot fix it on the spot, remove it from output.md and instead add it to notes.md with explanation.
- Be careful with the booleans `new_notes_append` and `new_outputs_append`: default is True (append). Use False only when deliberately rewriting everything.

Tasks:
1) Audit rigor: identify unjustified steps, false statements, missing lemmas; produce minimal counterexamples.
2) Triage value: separate genuine progress from noise.
3) Guide next steps: propose what provers should try next.

[{"prover_id": "01", "progress_md": "Round 0003 \u2014 audit, tightenings, and small new lemmas/examples\n\nQuick audit of output.md (what\u2019s solid, what to tighten)\n- Theorem A (complementary two-layer tile) is correct: it yields two singleton tilings with periods (1,\u03b1) and (1,\u03b1+1/2) and a clean irreducibility proof via the singleton/gcd criterion. The non-column proof is valid in the |J_0|=1/2 case by the \u201ccomponent-length\u201d obstruction.\n- Proposition G generalizes Theorem A to 1/q-periodic J_0 and shows q distinct incommensurable periods; the boundary obstruction gives a simple non-column criterion when |J_0|\u2209{1/m: m\u2208N}.\n- Proposition H completes the K={0,1,2} two-order mechanism with a simple non-column boundary argument; the \u201cSupplement to Proposition D\u201d fills the computational gap.\n- Minor presentational gap: Lemma B (irreducibility for singleton tilings) is given \u201cas sketched.\u201d For completeness, we should include the short closure argument explicitly (see below).\n- Small streamlining opportunity: Theorem A can be reframed without |J_0|=1/2 by appealing to Corollary F (pick |J_0|\u2209{1/m}), while still producing the two tilings with slopes \u03b1 and \u03b1+1/2 (using J_0+1/2=J_0). The current version is correct; a remark could point out this simplification.\n\nNew, small, checkable additions\n1) Necessity of gcd condition for irreducibility (complements Lemma B)\n- Lemma (reducibility when gcd>1). Let H:=\u27e8K\u2212K\u27e9\u2264Z. If H\u2260Z (i.e., g:=gcd{ k_i\u2212k_j } >1), then every tiling A+T of Z\u00d7S^1 is reducible by splitting T into g classes T^{(r)} according to the anchor\u2019s first coordinate modulo g and letting X_r:=gZ+r. Then A+T^{(r)}=X_r\u00d7S^1 a.e., and the union is disjoint. Why useful: records the converse to Lemma B and clarifies that H=Z is necessary for irreducibility in any regime, not only singleton.\n- Sketch proof. Any translate (z,\u03b8) of A contributes only to rows z+k_i, which are all \u2261 z (mod g). Therefore, contributions from anchors in residue class r (mod g) cover exactly the rows in X_r, and different residue classes never interact; hence a nontrivial decomposition exists whenever g>1.\n\n2) Explicit closure step for Lemma B (singleton irreducibility)\n- Detail to add. If T=T_1\u2294T_2 and Z=X_1\u2294X_2 with A+T_i=X_i\u00d7S^1, then for any m\u2208X_1 the row m must be fully covered by T_1. In the singleton regime row m uses precisely the anchors at indices m\u2212k_i, i=1,\u2026,\u2113; hence m\u2212k_i\u2208X_1 for all i. Now take any i,j. If m\u2208X_1 then m\u2212k_i\u2208X_1; if m+(k_j\u2212k_i)\u2209X_1, then row m+(k_j\u2212k_i) is in X_2 and must be covered solely by T_2, which requires (m+(k_j\u2212k_i))\u2212k_j=m\u2212k_i\u2208X_2\u2014contradiction. Thus X_1 is closed under addition by all differences k_j\u2212k_i. Hence X_1 is a union of cosets of H=\u27e8K\u2212K\u27e9. If H=Z then X_1 is either \u2205 or Z, proving irreducibility.\n\n3) General \u201crational shift\u201d incommensurability lemma (used implicitly several times)\n- Lemma. If \u03b1\u2209Q and r\u2208Q\\{0}, then \u03b1/(\u03b1+r)\u2209Q. Proof: \u03b1/(\u03b1+r)=p/q \u21d2 \u03b1 = (pr)/(q\u2212p) \u2208 Q unless p=q (which would force r=0). Why useful: it packages the incommensurability step used in Theorem A (r=1/2) and Proposition H (r=c_1 rational) into a one-liner.\n\nConcrete examples for testing\n- Theorem A numeric instance. Take U=[0,0.2]\u222a[0.3,0.35], \u03b1=\u221a2/10. Then J_0:=U\u222a(U+1/2), J_1:=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1), and A=({0}\u00d7J_0)\u222a({1}\u00d7J_1). The two tilings T_\u03b1 and T_{\u03b1+1/2} exist; both are singleton and hence irreducible. The periods are incommensurable by the lemma above. Non-column follows by the component-length mismatch (U has component lengths {0.2,0.05} while its complement in [0,1/2) has {0.1,0.15}).\n- Proposition H numeric instance. Let c_1=c_3=2/5, c_2=1/5; pick \u03b2=\u221a2/10 and set a_1=0, a_2\u2261a_1+c_1+\u03b2, a_3\u2261a_1+c_1+c_2+2\u03b2. Then the \u03c3=(1\u21922\u21923\u21921) and \u03c3\u2032=(1\u21923\u21922\u21921) congruences both hold, with slopes \u03b2 and \u03b2\u2032\u2261\u03b2\u22122/5 (mod 1). The tile is not a column by Lemma E (1/c_1=5/2\u2209N). Periods are incommensurable since \u03b2\u2209Q and c_1\u2208Q.\n\nOptional alternative non-column tool (recorded for future use)\n- Fourier complement obstruction (already noted in notes.md). If E+\u03b4=S^1\\E a.e., then e^{2\u03c0 i t \u03b4} = \u22121 for every t with \\hat{1_E}(t)\u22600. Choosing J_0 so that at least two even Fourier modes are nonzero (e.g., t=2,4) forbids such \u03b4. This is particularly handy if one insists on |J_0|=1/2 (where the boundary lemma alone does not rule out \u201c2-fold tiling\u201d at the boundary).\n\nGaps or clarifications suggested for output.md\n- Add the explicit closure argument to Lemma B (as above). This removes any ambiguity in the \u201csketch.\u201d\n- Consider adding the gcd-necessity lemma for irreducibility (above) to clarify that H=Z is not just sufficient but necessary for irreducibility. It is short and strengthens the structural picture.\n- Theorem A could include a remark that the |J_0|=1/2 hypothesis is not needed for the existence of the two tilings; any J_0 with J_0+1/2=J_0 works. If one also chooses |J_0|\u2209{1/m}, non-column follows immediately by Corollary F, avoiding the component-length hypothesis.\n\nNext steps (auditable targets)\n- Rigidity for complementary two-layer tiles. Attempt to show that for A=({0}\u00d7J_0)\u222a({1}\u00d7(S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1))) with J_0+1/q=J_0 and |J_0|\u2209{1/m}, every tiling is necessarily singleton (d_n\u22611). Plan: use row-by-row complementarity and a boundary bootstrap to rule out d_n\u22652 by propagating a contradiction across rows. Start with the q=2 case.\n- m-fold partition obstruction. For |J_0|=1/m, develop a clean criterion (Fourier or component-length) that forbids S^1 being a.e. a disjoint union of m translates of J_0. This would close the remaining corner cases for non-columnity under periodicity.\n- Expand the \u201ctwo orders\u201d mechanism to K of larger span (e.g., K={0,1,3}). Using Lemma C, classify when two distinct orders are simultaneously compatible and extract the induced affine relations among slopes; then apply a boundary lemma to ensure non-column.\n"}, {"prover_id": "02", "progress_md": "## Audit of output.md (consistency and small gaps)\n- Minor inconsistency: The top \u201cSummary of proven results\u201d still labels the K={0,1,2} two-order family as \u201cpending a non-column verification,\u201d but later Proposition H provides a complete non-column proof using the boundary lemma. Recommend updating the summary to reflect that this family is now fully established under s=c_1=c_3\u2209{1/m}.\n- Lemma B (irreducibility for singleton tilings) is correct; its proof could benefit from one explicit step: if a row m is assigned to X_1, then all anchors at indices m\u2212k_i must also lie in X_1 (else A+T_1 cannot cover row m), hence X_1 is closed under subtraction by each k_i; this gives the closure under K\u2212K used in the lemma.\n- Endpoint convention and J_1 as a union of intervals: the \u201cRemark on endpoints\u201d addresses this. No action needed.\n\n## New results (small, auditable lemmas advancing structure)\n\n### Lemma 1 (Singleton classification for the complementary two-layer construction)\nSetting: Let A=({0}\u00d7J_0)\u222a({1}\u00d7J_1) with J_1=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1) (\u03b1 arbitrary), and suppose A+T=Z\u00d7S^1 is a tiling. Let d_n=|T_n| and at row m write\n- U_m := \u22c3_{\u03b8\u2208T_m} (J_0+\u03b8) (pairwise a.e. disjoint by tiling disjointness across anchors),\n- V_m := \u22c3_{\u03b8\u2208T_{m-1}} (J_1+\u03b8) (also pairwise a.e. disjoint).\nThen U_m\u2294V_m=S^1 a.e. and, using J_1=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1), we have\nV_m = \u22c3_{\u03b8\u2208T_{m-1}} (S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1+\u03b8)) = S^1 \\ \u22c2_{\u03b8\u2208T_{m-1}} (J_0+\u03b1+\u03b8).\nTaking complements yields\n(\u2217)  U_m = \u22c2_{\u03b8\u2208T_{m-1}} (J_0+\u03b1+\u03b8)  a.e.\nClaim. Necessarily d_m=d_{m-1}=1 for all m; hence every tiling by such A is singleton-per-row.\nProof. Since the members of U_m are a.e. disjoint translates of J_0, |U_m| = d_m\u00b7|J_0|. The right-hand side of (\u2217) is an intersection of d_{m-1} translates of J_0, hence has measure at most |J_0|, with strict inequality if d_{m-1}\u22652 and the translates are distinct a.e. (duplicates are ruled out because corresponding J_1-shifts would coincide, contradicting disjointness of distinct anchors). Thus:\n- If d_{m-1}\u22652, then |U_m| < |J_0|, but |U_m|=d_m\u00b7|J_0|\u2265|J_0| if d_m\u22651, a contradiction. Hence d_{m-1}\u22641.\n- Symmetrically (exchanging the roles of J_0 and J_1 via V_m = S^1\\U_m), one gets d_m\u22641.\nBut the per-row measure identity |J_0|d_m+(1\u2212|J_0|)d_{m-1}=1 forces d_m=d_{m-1}=1. \u220e\nWhy useful here. This shows that for the complementary two-layer tiles (Theorem A, Proposition G), every tiling\u2014not just the exhibited helical ones\u2014is automatically singleton-per-row, so irreducibility follows immediately from Lemma B (gcd(K\u2212K)=1). It also rigidifies the setting and simplifies further analysis.\n\n### Corollary 2 (Row-to-row increment constraint)\nIn the setting of Lemma 1, let T_m={\u03b8_m}. Then for all m,\nJ_0+\u03b8_m = J_0+(\u03b1+\u03b8_{m\u22121}) a.e., hence \u03b8_m\u2212\u03b8_{m\u22121}\u2212\u03b1 belongs to the stabilizer Stab(J_0):={t\u2208S^1: J_0+t=J_0}.\nIn particular, if J_0 has 1/q-periodicity and no finer translational invariance, then \u03b8_m\u2212\u03b8_{m\u22121} \u2208 \u03b1 + (1/q)Z for all m.\nWhy useful here. This explains precisely why Proposition G yields the family of periods (1,\u03b1+j/q): if the increment were constant \u03b8_m\u2212\u03b8_{m\u22121}\u2261\u03b1+j/q, we recover the helical tilings in Prop. G. The corollary shows any tiling must step by \u03b1 plus a 1/q-increment at each row; in a further refinement, one can aim to prove that this increment is constant (hence classify all tilings) under mild nondegeneracy conditions.\n\n### Lemma 3 (No multi-translate coverage at a row for complementary tiles)\nIn the setting of Lemma 1, it is impossible to have d_m=0 or d_{m-1}=0 for any m.\nProof. If d_m=0 then V_m=S^1, i.e., \u22c3_{\u03b8\u2208T_{m-1}} (J_1+\u03b8)=S^1 with the union a.e. disjoint. Hence 1=|V_m|=d_{m-1}(1\u2212|J_0|), forcing d_{m-1}=1/(1\u2212|J_0|)\u2208N. When |J_0|\u22601\u22121/k this already contradicts integrality. Even in the special case |J_0|=1/2 (Theorem A), one would need d_{m-1}=2 and hence two a.e. disjoint translates of J_1 to partition S^1. For generic J_0, J_1=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1) is not a translational tiler by two copies (component-length or Fourier obstruction), so this cannot occur. The case d_{m-1}=0 is symmetric.\nWhy useful. This is a direct complement to Lemma 1 and helps rule out degenerate boundary behaviors in any classification.\n\n## Strengthening existing statements (cleaner non-column proofs)\n- Theorem A\u2019s non-column proof currently invokes a component-length invariant at |J_0|=1/2. Using Lemma E/Corollary F already recorded in output.md, if we simply pick |J_0|\u2209{1/m}, the non-columnity is immediate from the boundary obstruction, avoiding the specialized component-length check altogether. Suggest adding this as a remark, or presenting a variant \u201cTheorem A\u2032\u201d with |J_0| irrational and the same two tilings (then the second tiling uses \u03b1\u2192\u03b1+1/2 only if J_0 has 1/2-periodicity; otherwise the q-phase generalization, Prop. G, supplies many tilings with j/q shifts).\n- Proposition H (K={0,1,2} two-order family) is now complete; suggest updating the initial summary to drop \u201cpending.\u201d\n\n## Examples (explicit, checkable)\n- Theorem A instance: U=[0,0.2]\u222a[0.3,0.35], \u03b1=\u221a2/10. Then J_0:=U\u222a(U+1/2), J_1:=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1). Lemma 1 implies every tiling by A is singleton-per-row; T_\u03b1 and T_{\u03b1+1/2} are two such tilings; irreducibility by Lemma B; incommensurability by (iv). Non-column holds either by component-length or by Corollary F if we modify |U| to make |J_0|\u2209{1/m}.\n- K={0,1,2} two-order instance: c_1=c_3=2/5, c_2=1/5, \u03b2=\u221a2/10, a_1=0, a_2\u2261a_1+c_1+\u03b2, a_3\u2261a_2+c_2+\u03b2. Then \u03c3 and \u03c3\u2032 tilings exist with slopes \u03b2 and \u03b2\u2032\u2261\u03b2\u22122/5; irreducible (Lemma B), non-column (Lemma E since 1/c_1\u2209N), incommensurable (\u03b2 irrational, s rational).\n\n## Obstacles, caveats, and why some avenues fail\n- Classifying all tilings for the complementary construction: Lemma 1 shows per-row singleton-ness and Corollary 2 constrains the row increment modulo the stabilizer of J_0. Proving the increment is constant (hence all tilings are helical with period (1,\u03b1+j/q)) likely requires a rigidity argument exploiting disjointness across neighboring rows. I attempted a direct \u201cunion/complement equals intersection/union\u201d argument to force constancy but found it insufficient without an extra nondegeneracy hypothesis (e.g., small boundary or no repeated componentlengths). This is a promising next target.\n- Ratio ambiguity and representatives: Periods live in S^1; we consistently choose representatives \u03b1,\u03b1\u2032\u2208[0,1). All incommensurability tests used identities of the form \u03b1/(\u03b1+c)\u2209Q with c rational (or \u03b2/(\u03b2\u2212s)) which are invariant under changing representatives by integers, so no ambiguity occurs in the stated results.\n\n## Next steps (incremental, testable targets)\n1) Rigidity for the complementary construction. Prove that in Lemma 1\u2019s setting with J_0 having only 1/q-periodicity (no finer invariances), the increments \u03b8_m\u2212\u03b8_{m\u22121} are constant modulo 1/q, so every tiling is one of the q helical tilings in Proposition G. A concrete plan: compare rows m and m+1 to show that varying the increment creates overlap between A+(m,\u03b8_m) and A+(m+1,\u03b8_{m+1}) on the intermediate row, contradicting a.e. disjointness.\n2) Fourier variant for the two-copy obstruction. Formalize the \u201ctwo disjoint translates of J_1 cannot tile S^1\u201d statement via the Fourier lemma (already outlined in earlier rounds) and record it in output.md as a tool applicable when |J_0|=1/2.\n3) Broader multi-order mechanisms for K={0,1,2}. Systematically enumerate permutations \u03c3 for \u2113=3 and characterize simultaneous compatibilities beyond c_1=c_3, yielding possibly three or more distinct singleton tilings from a single tile. Each yields relations among slopes (linear in the c_i), and boundary Lemma E gives simple non-column criteria.\n4) Numerical verification scripts (for the record). For the provided examples, check: (a) row-by-row endpoint equalities; (b) a.e. disjointness; (c) period transport T_{n+1}=T_n+\u03b1 (or \u03b1+j/q); (d) non-column boundary equalities d_{p\u2212k_min}\u03bc_{k_min}=1 failing integrality. These are straightforward to code and audit.\n\n## Gaps flagged for output.md\n- Update the opening \u201cSummary of proven results\u201d to remove \u201cpending\u201d for the K={0,1,2} family, as Proposition H completes the non-column part.\n- Consider appending Lemma 1 and Corollary 2 to output.md: they substantially strengthen Theorem A and Proposition G by showing all tilings for those tiles are singleton-per-row, streamlining irreducibility and setting the stage for a full classification.\n"}, {"prover_id": "03", "progress_md": "## Audit of output.md and pinpointed gaps\n\n- Lemma C (\u201cequivalent\u201d congruences) needs a brief sufficiency argument. The current proof sketches necessity (matching endpoints in a fixed cyclic order yields the congruences). To justify equivalence, one should prove: if \u03b2 and the a_i satisfy (k_i\u2212k_{\u03c3(i)})\u03b2 \u2261 a_i+c_i\u2212a_{\u03c3(i)} (mod 1), then defining \u03b8_n:=\u03b8_0+n\u03b2 produces, for each row m, a phase \u03c6_m with \u03b8_{m\u2212k_i} = \u03c6_m + c_i \u2212 a_i and the \u03c3-adjacency equalities, hence a valid end-to-end partition of S^1 by the intervals [a_i+\u03b8_{m\u2212k_i}, a_i+\u03b8_{m\u2212k_i}+c_i]. This is a straightforward check but should be inserted to fully justify \u201cequivalent.\u201d\n- Theorem A(iii) (non-column): the step \u201cBecause X is finite, d_n=0 for all sufficiently large |n|\u201d is true but could be tightened. For K={0,1}, any anchor z contributes to rows z and z+1. If X is finite with p:=min X and q:=max X, then necessarily T_z=\u2205 unless z\u2208[p\u22121,q], hence d_n=0 for n<p\u22121 and n>q. This explicit localisation can be cited before deducing d_{p\u22121}=0 and d_p=2.\n- Endpoint convention for J_1: The remark at the end covers this, but it may help to explicitly state in Theorem A that J_1 can be chosen as a finite union of closed arcs differing from S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1) on a null set, keeping within the tile format.\n- Proposition D: the explicit algebra is given in the \u201cSupplement,\u201d which is excellent. To align with Lemma C\u2019s \u201cequivalence,\u201d it would be good to add a one-liner that, conversely, these congruences ensure the \u03c3 and \u03c3\u2032 partitions exist with \u03b8_n=\u03b8_0+n\u03b2 and \u03b8\u2032_n=\u03b8\u2032_0+n\u03b2\u2032.\n- Proposition H (incommensurability clause): it currently asserts incommensurability \u201cif s is rational.\u201d The algebra shows more: if \u03b2 is irrational then for any s\u2208(0,1), \u03b2/(\u03b2\u2212s)\u2208Q implies \u03b2\u2208Q unless p=q (which would force s=0). So the periods are incommensurable for all s\u2208(0,1) (rational or irrational). The non-column hypothesis s\u2209{1/m} is separate.\n\n## New small lemmas (auditable, to strengthen and extend the record)\n\n1) Sufficiency for Lemma C (singleton, fixed order produces a tiling).\n- Statement. Suppose K={k_1,\u2026,k_\u2113} with 1\u2208K, lengths c_i>0, \u2211 c_i=1, a_i\u2208S^1, and a cyclic order \u03c3. If \u03b2\u2208S^1 satisfies (k_i\u2212k_{\u03c3(i)})\u03b2 \u2261 a_i+c_i\u2212a_{\u03c3(i)} for all i, then for any \u03b8_0 the sequence \u03b8_n:=\u03b8_0+n\u03b2 produces, at each row m, an a.e. disjoint \u03c3-ordered partition of S^1 by the arcs [a_i+\u03b8_{m\u2212k_i}, a_i+\u03b8_{m\u2212k_i}+c_i].\n- Proof sketch. Define c_{\u03c3(1)}:=0 and c_{\u03c3(j+1)}:=c_{\u03c3(j)}+c_{\u03c3(j)} (cumulative along \u03c3) so that c_{\u03c3(\u2113+1)}\u22611. For row m, set \u03c6_m:=\u03b8_{m\u2212k_{\u03c3(1)}}\u2212c_{\u03c3(1)}+a_{\u03c3(1)}. The congruences ensure \u03b8_{m\u2212k_{\u03c3(j+1)}} \u2261 \u03b8_{m\u2212k_{\u03c3(j)}} + (a_{\u03c3(j)}+c_{\u03c3(j)}\u2212a_{\u03c3(j+1)}) (mod 1), hence the right endpoint of the j-th arc equals the left endpoint of the (j+1)-st arc, cycling back after \u2113 steps. The arcs meet end-to-end and have total length 1, hence they a.e. partition S^1.\n\n2) Rigidity of fiber cardinalities for Theorem A-type tiles.\n- Setting.

Assume J_0 does not admit any m-fold translational tiling of S^1 for m\u2208{2} (i.e., there is no \u03b4 with J_0 \u2294 (J_0+\u03b4) = S^1 a.e.).\n- Claim. In any tiling A+T=Z\u00d7S^1, one must have |T_n|=1 for all n.\n- Proof sketch (|J_0|=|J_1|=1/2 case). Let d_n:=|T_n|. The per-row measure identity yields d_n+d_{n\u22121}=2 for all n. If some n has d_n=2, then d_{n\u22121}=0 and row n is covered solely by two disjoint translates of J_0, contradicting the no-2-fold-tiling hypothesis. Similarly, d_n=0 is impossible. Hence d_n=1 for all n.\n- Use. This strengthens irreducibility (every tiling for such A is singleton) and closes a potential loophole in uniqueness of fiber sizes.\n\n3) Quick incommensurability check in Proposition H (clarified, no rationality of s needed).\n- If \u03b2 is irrational and \u03b2\u2032\u2261\u03b2\u2212s, s\u2208(0,1), then \u03b2/\u03b2\u2032\u2208Q \u21d2 (q\u2212p)\u03b2=\u2212ps \u2208 Q with p/q=\u03b2/\u03b2\u2032 \u21d2 \u03b2\u2208Q unless p=q (forcing s=0).

Irreducibility holds, and non-column follows either from d_n+d_{n\u22121}=2 and the 2-fold-tiling obstruction (component-lengths), or from Lemma E at the left boundary combined with the Fourier obstruction if |J_0|=1/2.\n- K={0,1,2} two-order instance. c_1=c_3=2/5, c_2=1/5, \u03b2=\u221a2/10, a_1=0, a_2\u2261a_1+c_1+\u03b2, a_3\u2261a_1+c_1+c_2+2\u03b2. Then \u03c3=(1\u21922\u21923\u21921) works with slope \u03b2; \u03c3\u2032 works with \u03b2\u2032\u2261\u03b2\u22122/5.

Set-up and notation
- Work in G = Z × S^1 (S^1 = R/Z). A tile A is a finite union of layers of the form {k_i}×[a_i,b_i] with 0 < b_i−a_i < 1, i=1,…,ℓ. A tiling T ⊂ Z×S^1 is a set of translations such that the (almost everywhere) disjoint union of A+(n,θ) over (n,θ)∈T equals Z×S^1. The fiber at n is T_n := {θ ∈ S^1 : (n,θ) ∈ T}. A period (k,α) means T+(k,α)=T.

Basic facts
- Fiber finiteness. In any tiling, every T_n is finite, and for each m we have ∑_i |T_{m−k_i}|·(b_i−a_i) = 1.
- Period transport. If (k,α) is a period then T_{n+k} = T_n + α for all n.

Singleton-per-row tilings
- Definition: |T_n|=1 for all n. Write T_n={θ_n}. Then column m is the (a.e.) disjoint union of the ℓ intervals [a_i+θ_{m−k_i}, b_i+θ_{m−k_i}], i=1,…,ℓ.
- Fixed cyclic order formulation. If, at each m, the ℓ intervals appear in the same cyclic order σ and meet end-to-end, then for some row phase φ_m one has θ_{m−k_i} = φ_m + c_i − a_i, where c_i are order-dependent constants with c_{σ(i)} ≡ c_i + (b_i−a_i) (mod 1). Consequently θ_{m−k_i} − θ_{m−k_j} is independent of m. If 1∈{k_i}, then θ_n−θ_{n−1} is constant, i.e. T has period (1,β) with β := θ_n−θ_{n−1}.
- Linear congruence system (Prover 03). Under a fixed order σ,
  (k_i − k_{σ(i)}) β ≡ a_i + (b_i−a_i) − a_{σ(i)}  (mod 1),  i=1,…,ℓ.
  For ℓ=3, K={0,1,2}, and orders σ=(1→2→3→1), σ'=(1→3→2→1), the two orders are simultaneously compatible for the same endpoints a_i iff c_1=c_3, and then the slopes satisfy β' ≡ β − c_1 (mod 1). This yields two distinct singleton tilings for the same tile when c_1=c_3.
- Irreducibility (singleton, gcd=1). Let H:=⟨K−K⟩≤Z. If H≠Z then any tiling splits along residue classes mod H; hence irreducibility forces H=Z. Moreover, if |T_n|=1 and H=Z then any partition T=T_1⊔T_2 induces Z=X_1⊔X_2 with X_1 closed under subtraction by each k_i and hence under ±(K−K); since H=Z, X_1 is either ∅ or Z. Thus singleton tilings with gcd(K−K)=1 are irreducible.

Two complementary-layer construction (explicit)
- Choose U⊂S^1 a finite union of disjoint intervals with |U|=1/4 and U∩(U+1/2)=∅ (e.g., U=[0,0.2)∪[0.3,0.35)). Let J_0:=U∪(U+1/2). Then |J_0|=1/2 and J_0+1/2=J_0. Pick an irrational α∈(0,1/2), and set J_1:=S^1\(J_0+α). Define A:=({0}×J_0)∪({1}×J_1).
- Two tilings. For any θ_0, define T_α={ (n, θ_0+nα): n∈Z }. On row n the contributions are (J_0+θ_n) and (J_1+θ_{n−1}) with θ_n=θ_0+nα, which are complementary because J_1=S^1\(J_0+α). Thus A+T_α=Z×S^1 a.e., and T_α has period (1,α). Using J_0+1/2=J_0 the same argument works for α' := α+1/2, giving a tiling T_{α'} with period (1,α'). Both are singleton tilings, hence irreducible by the lemma above (K={0,1} has gcd 1).
- Incommensurability. If α∉Q, then α/(α+1/2)∉Q: from α/(α+1/2)=p/q one deduces α=p/(2(q−p))∈Q, a contradiction.
- Non-column property (finite-column tilings impossible). Say A+T=X×S^1 with X finite. Let d_n:=|T_n|. On row n the union is a.e. disjoint, so |J_0| d_n + |J_1| d_{n−1} = 1_{n∈X}. With |J_0|=|J_1|=1/2 this yields d_n + d_{n−1} = 2·1_{n∈X}. Because X is finite, d_n=0 for all n sufficiently large/small. At the left boundary p of any connected component of X, we get d_{p−1}=0 and hence d_p=2; so row p is tiled by two disjoint translates of J_0 alone. Therefore S^1 is a.e. the disjoint union of two translates of J_0, which forces J_0+δ = S^1\J_0 for some δ. Our choice of U ensures this is impossible (the multiset of lengths of connected components of J_0 differs from that of its complement). Hence no such finite X exists: A is not a column.

Consequences
- This explicit A is a non-column tile that admits two irreducible periodic tilings with incommensurable vertical periods (1,α) and (1,α+1/2).
- Independently, for ℓ=3 and K={0,1,2} with c_1=c_3, the congruence mechanism produces two distinct singleton tilings of the same tile with slopes β and β'≡β−c_1. Picking β irrational makes β/(β') irrational unless a rational relation holds; such relations are at most countable in the parameter.

Next directions
- q-periodic generalization: If J_0 has 1/q-periodicity, the same complementary construction yields q tilings with slopes α+j/q; non-column persists under the same “no translational complement” obstruction.
- Non-column for K={0,1,2} singleton tiles: adapt the boundary-recurrence method with |J_•| = c_• to force a boundary row covered by a single layer, then forbid that layer from tiling S^1 by finitely many translates via a connected-component-length invariant.
Additional tools and extensions

1) Boundary obstruction to finite-column tilings (general form). For a tile A, define for each height k the aggregated layer J_k⊂S^1 as the union of all arcs at that height, and μ_k:=|J_k|. In any finite-column tiling A+T=X×S^1 with X finite and d_n:=|T_n|, the per-row measure identity is
  ∑_k μ_k · d_{m−k} = 1_{m∈X}, for all m∈Z.
If p:=min X and k_min:=min K, then only anchors with z=p−k_min can appear (any other anchor would create coverage outside X below p). Therefore d_{p−k_min} μ_{k_min}=1, so 1/μ_{k_min}∈N. Symmetrically, with q:=max X and k_max:=max K we get d_{q−k_max} μ_{k_max}=1, hence 1/μ_{k_max}∈N.

Consequences:
- K={0,1}: μ_{0}=|J_0|, μ_{1}=|J_1|. If |J_0|∉{1/m} then A is not a column. (This yields a very quick non-column test for two-layer tiles, including the complementary construction.)
- K={0,1,2}: If c_i denotes the total measure at height i (e.g., one interval per layer), then necessarily 1/c_1 and 1/c_3 are integers in any finite-column tiling. In particular, if c_1 or c_3 is not a reciprocal of an integer, the tile is not a column.

2) q-phase generalization of the complementary 2-layer construction. If J_0⊂S^1 is 1/q-periodic (J_0+1/q=J_0) and J_1:=S^1\(J_0+α) with α irrational, then for each j=0,1,…,q−1 the singleton set T_{α+j/q}:={(n,θ_0+n(α+j/q))} is a tiling with period (1,α+j/q). For j≠j′, the ratio (α+j/q)/(α+j′/q) cannot be rational (else α would be rational). If additionally |J_0|∉{1/m}, the boundary obstruction implies A is not a column. Irreducibility follows from the singleton-gcd criterion (K={0,1}).

3) Two-order singleton family for K={0,1,2} completed. When c_1=c_3=s, Lemma C shows the two cyclic orders (1→2→3→1) and (1→3→2→1) are simultaneously compatible and the slopes satisfy β′≡β−s (mod 1). If s∉{1/m}, the boundary obstruction rules out columns. If s is rational and β is irrational, then β/(β′) cannot be rational (else β would be rational), so the two periods are incommensurable.

4) Fourier alternative to translational complement. If E⊂S^1 satisfies E+δ = S^1\E a.e., then for all t≠0 with \hat{1_E}(t)≠0 we have e^{2π i t δ}=−1. In particular, if two distinct t’s have nonzero coefficients and cannot share a δ with e^{2π i t δ}=−1 simultaneously, such a δ cannot exist. This certifies non-columnity in cases like |J_0|=1/m when the boundary obstruction alone does not suffice.

Remark on endpoints. Complements produce open arcs; choosing closed representatives changes sets only on measure-zero boundaries and does not affect any of our tiling or measure identities.

Summary of proven results and why they matter
- Main existence theorem. We construct an explicit tile A⊂Z×S^1 that is not a column but admits two irreducible tilings with periods (1,α) and (1,α+1/2), where α is irrational; the two periods are incommensurable. This settles the core existence question positively.
- General structure for singleton tilings. We record a concise congruence system that reduces the singleton-per-row case to linear congruences, and an irreducibility criterion (gcd(K−K)=1).
- Two-order mechanism for K={0,1,2}. When c_1=c_3, a single tile admits two distinct singleton tilings corresponding to the cyclic orders (1→2→3→1) and (1→3→2→1); the slopes differ by c_1 modulo 1. This gives a second, independent family of examples (pending a non-column verification).

Theorem A (Non-column tile with two incommensurable periods). Fix an irrational α∈(0,1/2). Let U⊂S^1 be a finite union of disjoint intervals of total length 1/4 such that U∩(U+1/2)=∅ and the multiset of lengths of connected components of U is different from that of its complement in [0,1/2). Define J_0:=U∪(U+1/2) (so |J_0|=1/2 and J_0+1/2=J_0), J_1:=S^1\(J_0+α), and set A:=( {0}×J_0 ) ∪ ( {1}×J_1 ). Then:
(i) There is a tiling T_α with period (1,α), and a tiling T_{α+1/2} with period (1,α+1/2).
(ii) Both tilings are irreducible.
(iii) A is not a column (i.e., there is no finite X⊂Z and T⊂Z×S^1 with A+T=X×S^1).
(iv) The periods are incommensurable: α/(α+1/2)∉Q.
Proof.
(i) Define T_α:={(n,θ_0+nα): n∈Z}. On row n the contributions are (J_0+θ_n) with θ_n=θ_0+nα and (J_1+θ_{n−1}). Since J_1=S^1\(J_0+α), we have J_1+θ_{n−1}=S^1\(J_0+θ_{n−1}+α)=S^1\(J_0+θ_n). Thus these two sets are complementary (disjoint a.e. and union S^1), giving a tiling. The definition is invariant under (1,α), so T_α has period (1,α). For α' := α+1/2, define T_{α'} analogously; the identity J_0+1/2=J_0 yields J_1+θ'_{n−1}=S^1\(J_0+θ'_n), so T_{α'} tiles with period (1,α').
(ii) These are singleton tilings with K={0,1}; since gcd{0−0,0−1,1−0,1−1}=1, the irreducibility lemma below applies.
(iii) Suppose A+T=X×S^1 with X finite. Let d_n:=|T_n|. By a.e. disjointness, on each n∈Z we have |J_0| d_n + |J_1| d_{n−1} = 1_{n∈X}. Since |J_0|=|J_1|=1/2, this simplifies to d_n + d_{n−1} = 2·1_{n∈X}. Because X is finite, d_n=0 for all sufficiently large |n|; in particular, at the left endpoint p of any connected component of X we have d_{p−1}=0, hence d_p=2. Thus row p is tiled entirely by two disjoint translates of J_0. This forces S^1 to be a.e. the disjoint union of two translates of J_0, i.e., J_0+δ = S^1\J_0 for some δ. But translation preserves the multiset of connected-component lengths, which by construction differs between J_0 and its complement (coming from the complement of U in [0,1/2)), a contradiction. Therefore A admits no finite-column tiling.
(iv) If α/(α+1/2)=p/q∈Q, then α = (p/q)(α+1/2), so α(1−p/q)=p/(2q), hence α=p/(2(q−p))∈Q, contradicting the choice of α.
∎

Lemma B (Irreducibility for singleton tilings with gcd(K−K)=1). Let A have layers at K={k_1,…,k_ℓ} and suppose |T_n|=1 for all n (singleton). Let H:=⟨K−K⟩≤Z. If H=Z then any tiling is irreducible: any putative partition T=T_1⊔T_2 forces the index set X_1={n: T_n⊂T_1} to be closed under subtraction by each k_i and hence under ±(K−K); since H=Z, X_1 is either ∅ or Z.
Proof. As sketched; the closure shows X_1 is a union of cosets of H=Z, hence trivial.
∎

Lemma C (Singleton congruences under a fixed cyclic order). Assume |T_n|=1 and the ℓ intervals appear in a fixed cyclic order σ on every row. Then if β:=θ_n−θ_{n−1} (mod 1), the adjacency constraints are equivalent to the congruence system
 (k_i − k_{σ(i)}) β ≡ a_i + (b_i−a_i) − a_{σ(i)}  (mod 1), i=1,…,ℓ.
Proof. Writing θ_{m−k_i}=φ_m + c_i − a_i and matching consecutive endpoints in order σ gives the displayed congruences.
∎

Proposition D (Two orders for K={0,1,2}). Let ℓ=3, K=(0,1,2), c_i=b_i−a_i>0 with c_1+c_2+c_3=1. Consider orders σ=(1→2→3→1) and σ'=(1→3→2→1). Then the two orders are simultaneously compatible for the same endpoints a_i iff c_1=c_3. In that case, if the first tiling has slope β, the second has slope β'≡β−c_1 (mod 1).
Proof. Apply Lemma C to σ and σ', solve the σ-system for a_2,a_3 in terms of a_1,β,c’s, and substitute into the σ'-system. Consistency is equivalent to c_1=c_3, and then β' is forced to equal β−c_1 (mod 1).
∎
Additional proven results (completing and extending the main constructions)

Lemma E (Boundary obstruction to finite-column tilings). Let A⊂Z×S^1 be a tile. For each height k∈K, set J_k:=⋃_{i: k_i=k}[a_i,b_i] (union of all arcs at height k) and μ_k:=|J_k|. Suppose A+T=X×S^1 with X⊂Z finite, and set d_n:=|T_n|. Then:
(a) If p:=min X and k_min:=min K, we have d_{p−k_min} μ_{k_min} = 1. In particular, 1/μ_{k_min}∈N.
(b) If q:=max X and k_max:=max K, we have d_{q−k_max} μ_{k_max} = 1. In particular, 1/μ_{k_max}∈N.
Proof. The per-row measure identity ∑_k μ_k·d_{m−k} = 1_{m∈X} holds for all m. For (a), let p=min X. Any translate anchored at z<p−k_min would cover a row <p; likewise, any translate anchored at z=p−k with k>k_min would cover z+k_min<p. Thus the only possible anchors contributing to row p are those with z=p−k_min, and their contributions to row p are copies of J_{k_min}, almost disjoint across anchors. Therefore d_{p−k_min} μ_{k_min}=1. The proof of (b) is symmetric: any translate anchored at z>q−k_max would cover a row >q; and any anchored at z=q−k with k<k_max would cover q+(k_max−k)>q. Thus only z=q−k_max occurs, yielding d_{q−k_max} μ_{k_max}=1. ∎

Corollary F (Quick non-column test for two-layer tiles). For A=({0}×J_0)∪({1}×J_1), any finite-column tiling forces |J_0|^{-1}∈N. Hence if |J_0|∉{1/m: m∈N}, A is not a column. ∎

Proposition G (q-phase generalization of the complementary 2-layer construction). Fix q≥2. Let J_0⊂S^1 satisfy J_0+1/q=J_0 and choose irrational α. Define J_1:=S^1\(J_0+α) and A:=( {0}×J_0 )∪( {1}×J_1 ). Then:
(i) For each j=0,1,…,q−1 there is a singleton tiling T_{α+j/q} with period (1,α+j/q).
(ii) If j≠j′, the periods (1,α+j/q) and (1,α+j′/q) are incommensurable.
(iii) If |J_0|∉{1/m: m∈N}, then A is not a column.
(iv) Each T_{α+j/q} is irreducible.
Proof. (i) Define T_{α+j/q}:={(n,θ_0+n(α+j/q))}. On row n, J_0+θ_n and J_1+θ_{n−1}=S^1\(J_0+θ_{n−1}+α)=S^1\(J_0+θ_n) (since J_0+1/q=J_0), hence they are complementary a.e. (ii) If (α+j/q)/(α+j′/q)∈Q with j≠j′, solve for α to find α∈Q, contradiction. (iii) Apply Corollary F with μ_0=|J_0|. (iv) These are singleton tilings with K={0,1} and gcd(K−K)=1, so Lemma B gives irreducibility. ∎

Proposition H (Completion of the K={0,1,2} two-order mechanism: non-column family with two incommensurable periods). Let K=(0,1,2) and c_i=b_i−a_i>0 with c_1+c_2+c_3=1. Assume c_1=c_3=s and s∉{1/m: m∈N}. Then there exist endpoints a_1,a_2,a_3 and an irrational slope β such that the tile A:=⋃_{i=1}^3({k_i}×[a_i,b_i]) admits two distinct singleton tilings corresponding to the cyclic orders σ=(1→2→3→1) and σ′=(1→3→2→1), with slopes β and β′≡β−s (mod 1), respectively. Both tilings are irreducible, their periods are incommensurable if s is rational, and A is not a column.
Proof. By Proposition D (proved via Lemma C), when c_1=c_3 the σ and σ′ congruence systems are simultaneously compatible and force β′≡β−c_1. Fix any irrational β and a_1, and solve the σ-congruences to obtain a_2,a_3; these also solve σ′. The tilings are singleton, hence irreducible by Lemma B (since ⟨K−K⟩=Z). If s is rational and β is irrational, β/(β′)∈Q would imply β∈Q, a contradiction; thus the periods are incommensurable. Finally, apply Lemma E at both boundaries (μ_0=c_1 and μ_2=c_3) to conclude that any finite-column tiling would force 1/c_1 and 1/c_3 to be integers; since s∉{1/m}, no such tiling exists. ∎

Remark on endpoint conventions. Complements produce open arcs; choosing closed representatives modifies sets only on measure-zero boundaries and does not affect the a.e. tiling statements or the measure identities used above.

Supplement to Proposition D (explicit algebra). For completeness, the σ-system is −β≡a_1+c_1−a_2, −β≡a_2+c_2−a_3, 2β≡a_3+c_3−a_1; solving gives a_2≡a_1+c_1+β and a_3≡a_1+c_1+c_2+2β, consistent with c_1+c_2+c_3=1. The σ′-system is −2β′≡a_1+c_1−a_3, β′≡a_3+c_3−a_2, β′≡a_2+c_2−a_1. Substituting a_2,a_3 and comparing the two expressions for β′ yields c_1=c_3 and β′≡β−c_1 (mod 1).
