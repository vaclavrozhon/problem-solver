{"feedback_md":"Overall, there is solid progress plus a few gaps that need careful correction.\n\nWhat is solid and incorporated:\n- Prover 01’s “gcd necessity” lemma (if H:=⟨K−K⟩≠Z then any tiling splits by residues modulo g) is correct, short, and completes the singleton irreducibility picture into a necessary-and-sufficient condition in general. We add it to output.md.\n- The explicit closure step for Lemma B is good and removes ambiguity in the current sketch. We fully write it out in output.md.\n- The rational-shift incommensurability lemma (if α∉Q and r∈Q\\{0} then α/(α+r)∉Q) is correct; we record a slightly more general version (for any a≠b in Q: (α+a)/(α+b)∉Q) which directly covers Proposition G’s incommensurability.\n- Prover 03’s request to add the sufficiency half of Lemma C is well taken. We include a clean sufficiency argument: the congruences force end-to-end adjacency in the fixed cyclic order, yielding a partition of S^1 at every row with slope β.\n- For Theorem A-type tiles (|J_0|=1/2 and J_1=S^1\\(J_0+α)), we add a rigorous “fiber-cardinality rigidity” lemma: assuming J_0 does not admit a two-translate partition of S^1, any tiling must have |T_n|=1 for all n. This closes the possibility of exotic d-patterns in the complementary construction used in Theorem A.\n\nGaps and corrections:\n- Prover 02’s Lemma 1 (claiming d_m=d_{m−1}=1 for every tiling of the complementary two-layer construction without further hypotheses) is too strong as stated. The key step only proves that if d_{m−1}≥1 then d_m≤1, and symmetrically if d_{m}≥1 then d_{m−1}≤1; but it does not rule out the 0/2 degeneracy without an extra hypothesis (e.g., forbidding two-translate tilings of J_0 or J_1). We therefore do not add Lemma 1 as stated. Instead we add the |J_0|=1/2 rigidity lemma that leverages the “no two-translate tiling” condition (which Theorem A already enforces by construction).\n- Prover 02’s Lemma 3 relies on “generic” obstructions (component-lengths/Fourier) and is not a general statement; we keep it in the notes as a tool but do not claim it as a theorem.\n- Prover 03’s proposed strengthening of Proposition H’s incommensurability (“no rationality of s needed”) is false in general: e.g., β=√2 and s=β/2 give β/(β−s)=2∈Q. Thus, we retain the rationality-of-s hypothesis in Prop. H’s incommensurability clause. We record this counterexample in the notes.\n\nCleanups and consistency:\n- We update the Summary at the top of output.md: the K={0,1,2} two-order family is no longer “pending non-column”; Proposition H completes it.\n- We add a remark pointing out that Theorem A’s non-column proof can alternatively invoke the boundary obstruction (Corollary F) by choosing |J_0|∉{1/m}, avoiding the component-length argument.\n\nNext steps (concrete and testable):\n1) Classification for the complementary construction. Under a mild “no two-translate” (|J_0|≠1/m or use Fourier obstruction) and a minimal-period assumption (J_0 has only 1/q translational invariance), aim to show the row increment θ_m−θ_{m−1} is constant modulo 1/q. Plan: use the identity U_m=⋂_{θ∈T_{m−1}}(J_0+α+θ), the singleton-per-row consequence, and compare consecutive rows to show any variation in the 1/q-offset generates overlaps contradicting disjointness.\n2) Fourier two-copy obstruction. Formalize and add the “two disjoint translates cannot tile S^1” lemma (already sketched) as a general tool for |J_0|=1/2 or more generally |J_0|=1/m, thereby closing remaining corner cases uniformly.\n3) Extend the multi-order mechanism to other K (e.g. {0,1,3}) using the Lemma C congruence framework; seek simultaneous order compatibilities and then enforce non-column via Lemma E.\n4) Numerical verification scripts (sanity checks) for the examples: endpoint matching per row, a.e. disjointness, period transport T_{n+1}=T_n+α (or α+j/q), and boundary obstruction integrality conditions.\n","new_notes_md":"Updates, corrections, and new tools\n\n1) On the “complementary two-layer” structure A=({0}×J_0)∪({1}×J_1) with J_1=S^1\\(J_0+α)\n- Intersection identity. For any tiling A+T and row m, writing U_m:=⋃_{θ∈T_m}(J_0+θ) and V_m:=⋃_{θ∈T_{m−1}}(J_1+θ), we have U_m⊔V_m=S^1 a.e. and\n  V_m = ⋃_{θ∈T_{m−1}} (S^1\\(J_0+α+θ)) = S^1 \\ ⋂_{θ∈T_{m−1}} (J_0+α+θ).\n  Hence U_m = ⋂_{θ∈T_{m−1}} (J_0+α+θ) a.e. In particular, if d_{m−1}:=|T_{m−1}|≥1 then |U_m|≤|J_0|, which implies d_m≤1 (since U_m is a disjoint union of d_m translates of J_0). A symmetric statement holds one step forward: if d_m≥1 then d_{m+1}≤1.\n- Degeneracy (0/2) is not excluded without extra hypotheses. For |J_0|=|J_1|=1/2, the per-row identity is d_m+d_{m−1}=2. The pattern (…,2,0,2,0,…) is compatible with this identity; ruling it out requires forbidding two-translate tilings of J_0 (and hence of J_1). Our Theorem A already enforces this (via component-length mismatch). Under this “no two-translate” hypothesis we can prove d_m=1 for all m (see new Proposition I in output.md).\n\n2) Irreducibility and gcd(K−K)\n- Necessity. If H:=⟨K−K⟩≠Z (say gcd g>1), any tiling splits along residue classes modulo g: for T^{(r)}:={ (z,θ)∈T : z≡r (mod g) } one has A+T^{(r)} = X_r×S^1 a.e. where X_r:=gZ+r, and the union over r is disjoint. Thus H=Z is necessary for irreducibility, not only in the singleton regime.\n- Sufficiency in the singleton case. We include the full closure argument: if T=T_1⊔T_2 yields A+T_i=X_i×S^1, then from m∈X_1 all m−k_i∈X_1, hence X_1 is a union of cosets of H. If H=Z, X_1 is ∅ or Z.\n\n3) Singleton with fixed cyclic order: equivalence (Lemma C)\n- We now record the sufficiency half: if β and the a_i satisfy (k_i−k_{σ(i)})β≡a_i+c_i−a_{σ(i)} (mod 1), then θ_n:=θ_0+nβ produces, at each row m, ℓ arcs that meet end-to-end in the σ-order and (since ∑c_i=1) a.e. partition S^1.\n\n4) Incommensurability tools\n- General rational-shift test. If α∉Q and a≠b∈Q, then (α+a)/(α+b)∉Q. In particular, if α∉Q and r∈Q\\{0}, then α/(α+r)∉Q. This packages the algebra used repeatedly in Theorem A and Prop. G.\n- Caution (Prop. H). The statement “β/(β−s)∉Q for all s∈(0,1)” is false without assuming s∈Q; e.g., β=√2 and s=β/2 give β/(β−s)=2∈Q. We retain the hypothesis s rational in the incommensurability clause of Prop. H.\n\n5) Fourier two-copy obstruction (record)\n- If E+δ=S^1\\E a.e., then for every t≠0 with \\hat{1_E}(t)≠0 we have e^{2πitδ}=−1. This is useful to forbid two-translate tilings when |E|=1/2 (or more generally |E|=1/m), and underpins the “no two-translate” hypothesis.\n\n6) Next targets (rigidity and classification)\n- Under J_0 with only 1/q-translational invariance, prove that any complementary two-layer tiling must have constant increment θ_m−θ_{m−1} modulo 1/q; hence classify all tilings as the q helical ones from Prop. G. Strategy: use the intersection identity row-to-row and endpoint propagation to show that varying the 1/q offset produces overlaps.\n- Systematically extend the multi-order mechanism beyond K={0,1,2}, again leveraging Lemma C and boundary obstruction Lemma E.\n","new_notes_append":"True","new_outputs_md":"Summary of proven results and why they matter\n- Main existence theorem (Theorem A). We construct an explicit tile A⊂Z×S^1 that is not a column yet admits two irreducible tilings with periods (1,α) and (1,α+1/2), with α irrational; these two periods are incommensurable. This positively settles the core existence question.\n- General structure for singleton tilings. We record a concise congruence system that characterizes singleton-per-row tilings with a fixed cyclic order, now with both necessity and sufficiency, and an irreducibility criterion. We also prove that gcd(K−K)=1 is not only sufficient (in the singleton setting) but that gcd(K−K)>1 forces reducibility in general.\n- Complementary two-layer family: q-phase generalization. If J_0 has 1/q-periodicity, the complementary construction yields q singleton tilings with incommensurable vertical periods (1,α+j/q). A quick boundary test certifies non-columnity whenever |J_0|∉{1/m}.\n- Two-order mechanism for K={0,1,2} completed. When c_1=c_3, a single tile admits two distinct singleton tilings corresponding to the cyclic orders (1→2→3→1) and (1→3→2→1); the slopes differ by c_1 modulo 1. Non-columnity follows from the boundary obstruction when c_1∉{1/m}. If c_1 is rational and the slope is irrational, the two periods are incommensurable.\n- Rigidity for Theorem A-type tiles. For the complementary two-layer tiles with |J_0|=1/2 that do not admit a two-translate partition of S^1, every tiling is automatically singleton-per-row. This streamlines irreducibility and supports further classification.\n\nTheorem A (Non-column tile with two incommensurable periods). Fix an irrational α∈(0,1/2). Let U⊂S^1 be a finite union of disjoint intervals of total length 1/4 such that U∩(U+1/2)=∅ and the multiset of lengths of connected components of U is different from that of its complement in [0,1/2). Define J_0:=U∪(U+1/2) (so |J_0|=1/2 and J_0+1/2=J_0), J_1:=S^1\\(J_0+α), and set A:=( {0}×J_0 ) ∪ ( {1}×J_1 ). Then:\n(i) There is a tiling T_α with period (1,α), and a tiling T_{α+1/2} with period (1,α+1/2).\n(ii) Both tilings are irreducible.\n(iii) A is not a column (i.e., there is no finite X⊂Z and T⊂Z×S^1 with A+T=X×S^1).\n(iv) The periods are incommensurable: α/(α+1/2)∉Q.\nProof. (i)–(iv) As in the previous version; we only note that (iii) can also be deduced from Corollary F by instead choosing |J_0|∉{1/m}, in which case the boundary obstruction immediately rules out finite-column tilings. ∎\n\nLemma B (Irreducibility for singleton tilings with gcd(K−K)=1). Let A have layers at K={k_1,…,k_ℓ} and suppose |T_n|=1 for all n (singleton). Let H:=⟨K−K⟩≤Z. If H=Z then any tiling is irreducible.\nProof. Assume a decomposition T=T_1⊔T_2 such that A+T_i=X_i×S^1 with Z=X_1⊔X_2 disjoint. Fix m∈X_1. In row m the contributing anchors are exactly at indices m−k_i (one per i). If for some i we had m−k_i∉X_1, then the corresponding interval [a_i+θ_{m−k_i},b_i+θ_{m−k_i}] would belong to A+T_2 and yet lie inside row m∈X_1, contradicting A+T_1=X_1×S^1. Hence m−k_i∈X_1 for all i, so X_1 is closed under subtraction by each k_i, hence under ±(K−K). Therefore X_1 is a union of cosets of H. If H=Z, only ∅ and Z occur, proving irreducibility. ∎\n\nLemma B′ (Reducibility when gcd(K−K)>1). Let H:=⟨K−K⟩ and suppose H≠Z, with index g:=[Z:H]>1. For r=0,1,…,g−1 let T^{(r)}:={ (z,θ)∈T : z≡r (mod g) } and X_r:=gZ+r. Then A+T^{(r)}=X_r×S^1 a.e., and thus A+T is reducible into g disjoint tilings along residue classes mod g.\nProof. A translate anchored at z contributes only to rows z+k_i, each ≡z (mod g). Hence only anchors with z≡r can contribute to rows in X_r, and conversely all coverage of a row m∈X_r comes from T^{(r)}. Disjointness across distinct r is automatic since they occupy disjoint rows. ∎\n\nLemma C (Singleton congruences under a fixed cyclic order: necessity and sufficiency). Assume |T_n|=1 and that on every row the ℓ intervals appear in the same cyclic order σ and meet end-to-end. Let c_i:=b_i−a_i and β:=θ_n−θ_{n−1} (mod 1). Then the adjacency constraints are equivalent to the congruence system\n  (k_i − k_{σ(i)}) β ≡ a_i + c_i − a_{σ(i)}  (mod 1),  i=1,…,ℓ.\nProof. Necessity: matching the right endpoint of i with the left endpoint of σ(i) and using θ_{m−k_i}−θ_{m−k_{σ(i)}}=(k_{σ(i)}−k_i)β gives the displayed congruences. Sufficiency: Given β solving these congruences, define θ_n:=θ_0+nβ. At row m put intervals I_i:=[a_i+θ_{m−k_i}, a_i+θ_{m−k_i}+c_i]. The congruences read a_i+θ_{m−k_i}+c_i ≡ a_{σ(i)}+θ_{m−k_{σ(i)}}, so the right endpoint of I_i equals the left endpoint of I_{σ(i)}. Summing lengths gives ∑_i|I_i|=∑_ic_i=1. Thus the I_i meet end-to-end around the circle in the σ-order and (apart from endpoints) are disjoint, forming an a.e. partition of S^1. ∎\n\nLemma E (Boundary obstruction to finite-column tilings). [As before.] ∎\n\nCorollary F (Quick non-column test for two-layer tiles). [As before.] ∎\n\nProposition G (q-phase generalization of the complementary 2-layer construction). [As before; incommensurability follows from the rational-shift Lemma R below by taking a=j/q, b=j′/q.] ∎\n\nProposition H (Completion of the K={0,1,2} two-order mechanism: non-column family with two incommensurable periods). Let K=(0,1,2) and c_i=b_i−a_i>0 with c_1+c_2+c_3=1. Assume c_1=c_3=s and s∉{1/m: m∈N}. Then there exist endpoints a_1,a_2,a_3 and an irrational slope β such that the tile A:=⋃_{i=1}^3({k_i}×[a_i,b_i]) admits two distinct singleton tilings corresponding to the cyclic orders σ=(1→2→3→1) and σ′=(1→3→2→1), with slopes β and β′≡β−s (mod 1), respectively. Both tilings are irreducible, their periods are incommensurable if s is rational, and A is not a column.\nProof. As before: Lemma C and its supplement give existence; Lemma B yields irreducibility (⟨K−K⟩=Z). If s∈Q and β∉Q, then β/β′∈Q would force β∈Q. Non-column follows from Lemma E at k=0 and k=2 since 1/s∉N. ∎\n\nSupplement to Proposition D (explicit algebra). [As before.] ∎\n\nProposition I (Singleton rigidity for the |J_0|=1/2 complementary tiles). Let A=({0}×J_0)∪({1}×J_1) with J_1=S^1\\(J_0+α) and |J_0|=|J_1|=1/2. Assume J_0 does not admit a two-translate partition of S^1 (i.e., there is no δ with J_0 ⊔ (J_0+δ)=S^1 a.e.). Then every tiling A+T=Z×S^1 satisfies |T_n|=1 for all n.\nProof. Let d_n:=|T_n|. The per-row measure identity gives d_n+d_{n−1}=2 for all n. If d_n=2 for some n, then d_{n−1}=0 and row n is covered solely by two disjoint translates of J_0, contradicting the hypothesis. Similarly, d_n=0 is impossible. Hence d_n=1 for all n. ∎\n\nCorollary J (Row-to-row increment constraint in the complementary case). In the setting of Proposition I, writing T_n={θ_n}, for every m we have J_0+θ_m = J_0+(α+θ_{m−1}) a.e. Hence θ_m−θ_{m−1}−α∈Stab(J_0):={t∈S^1 : J_0+t=J_0 a.e.}. In particular, if J_0 has 1/q-periodicity and no finer translational invariance, then θ_m−θ_{m−1}∈α+(1/q)Z for all m.\nProof. From U_m=⋃_{θ∈T_m}(J_0+θ) and U_m=S^1\\V_m with V_m=⋃_{θ∈T_{m−1}}(J_1+θ), Proposition I gives d_m=d_{m−1}=1, so U_m=J_0+θ_m and also U_m=J_0+(α+θ_{m−1}). Thus J_0+θ_m=J_0+(α+θ_{m−1}) a.e. The stabilizer conclusion follows immediately. ∎\n\nLemma R (Rational-shift incommensurability). If α∉Q and a≠b∈Q, then (α+a)/(α+b)∉Q. In particular, if α∉Q and r∈Q\\{0}, then α/(α+r)∉Q.\nProof. If (α+a)/(α+b)=p/q∈Q, then α+a=(p/q)(α+b), so (1−p/q)α=(p/q)b−a∈Q. Since a≠b, 1−p/q≠0, hence α∈Q, a contradiction. The special case takes b=0 and a=r. ∎\n\nRemark on endpoint conventions. Complements produce open arcs; choosing closed representatives modifies sets only on measure-zero boundaries and does not affect any a.e. tiling statements or measure identities above.\n","new_outputs_append":"False","verdict":"partial success"}
