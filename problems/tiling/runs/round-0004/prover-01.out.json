Non-column proof via the \u201ctwo-translate impossibility\u201d is sound because at the left boundary one forces two a.e. disjoint translates of J_0 to cover S^1. The endpoint issue is already covered by the \u201cRemark on endpoints.\u201d A small presentational note: the parenthetical \u201c(iii) can also be deduced from Corollary F by instead choosing |J_0|\u2209{1/m})\u201d refers to a variant of the theorem (with |J_0| not fixed to 1/2); as written, (iii) is proven via the component-length obstruction.\n- Proposition H: The incommensurability clause correctly assumes s rational. We record below a slightly more flexible sufficient condition (s/\u03b2 \u2209 Q), which can be used to ensure incommensurability for arbitrary s by choosing \u03b2 appropriately.\n- Proposition I: Good fix of an earlier overreach; the additional hypothesis \u201cno two-translate partition of S^1 by J_0\u201d is essential in the |J_0|=1/2 case.\n\nNew small lemmas/propositions (auditable, with short proofs)\n1) Singleton rigidity for complementary two-layer tiles under a mild integrality exclusion.\n- Lemma S. Let A=({0}\u00d7J_0)\u222a({1}\u00d7J_1) with J_1=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1). If either 1/(1\u2212|J_0|)\u2209N or 1/|J_0|\u2209N, then every tiling A+T=Z\u00d7S^1 satisfies |T_n|=1 for all n.\n  Proof. Let d_n:=|T_n|. The per-row measure identity yields |J_0| d_n + (1\u2212|J_0|) d_{n\u22121} = 1 for all n. The intersection identity (recorded in output.md) implies: if d_{n\u22121}\u22651 then d_n\u22641. If 1/(1\u2212|J_0|)\u2209N and some d_m=0, then (1\u2212|J_0|) d_{m\u22121}=1 forces a contradiction; hence d_n\u22651 for all n, thus d_n\u22641 by the previous inequality, so d_n=1. Symmetrically, if 1/|J_0|\u2209N and some d_{m\u22121}=0, then |J_0| d_m=1 contradicts integrality; shifting indices gives d_n\u22651 for all n, hence d_n=1 by the inequality. \u220e\n  Why useful here. This supplies an easy route to singleton-per-row (hence irreducibility) for many complementary tiles without invoking the two-translate obstruction; it also streamlines non-column arguments when combined with Lemma B.\n\n2) Meandering classification of singleton tilings for the complementary construction.\n- Proposition K (classification). Let A=({0}\u00d7J_0)\u222a({1}\u00d7J_1) with J_1=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1). Assume a tiling is singleton-per-row, T_n={\u03b8_n}. Then for every n one has J_0+\u03b8_n = J_0+(\u03b1+\u03b8_{n\u22121}) a.e., i.e. \u03b4_n:=\u03b8_n\u2212\u03b8_{n\u22121}\u2212\u03b1 \u2208 Stab(J_0):={t: J_0+t=J_0 a.e.}. Conversely, for any sequence (\u03b4_n) with values in Stab(J_0), the sequence defined by \u03b8_n:=\u03b8_0+\u2211_{j=1}^n(\u03b1+\u03b4_j) yields a singleton tiling T={ (n,\u03b8_n) }.\n  Proof. The \u201conly if\u201d direction is Corollary J. For the converse, on row n we have J_0+\u03b8_n and J_1+\u03b8_{n\u22121}=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1+\u03b8_{n\u22121}). Since \u03b4_n\u2208Stab(J_0), J_0+\u03b8_n=J_0+\u03b1+\u03b8_{n\u22121}+\u03b4_n=J_0+\u03b1+\u03b8_{n\u22121} a.e., so the two contributions are complementary a.e. Pairwise a.e. disjointness holds because different anchors contribute on disjoint rows or contribute complementary sets on the same row. \u220e\n  Why useful here. This shows there are many (generally aperiodic) irreducible singleton tilings for complementary two-layer tiles; periodic choices correspond to \u03b4_n constant, recovering the families in Theorem A and Proposition G. It corrects a prior (overly rigid) heuristic that increments must be constant.\n\n3) Flexible incommensurability for the K={0,1,2} two-order family.\n- Lemma Q. If s\u2208(0,1) and \u03b2\u2209Q satisfy s/\u03b2\u2209Q, then \u03b2/(\u03b2\u2212s)\u2209Q.\n  Proof. If \u03b2/(\u03b2\u2212s)=p/q\u2208Q, then (q\u2212p)\u03b2=ps, so s/\u03b2=(q\u2212p)/p\u2208Q, contradiction. \u220e\n  Why useful here. Proposition H can achieve incommensurability without assuming s rational by choosing \u03b2 so that s/\u03b2\u2209Q (e.g., \u03b2 irrational and rationally independent from s).\n\n4) Fourier obstruction to two-translate complement (explicit numeric check for Theorem A\u2019s U).\n- Lemma F2 (explicit check). For U=[0,0.2]\u222a[0.3,0.35] and J_0:=U\u222a(U+1/2), one has \\hat{1_{J_0}}(2) and \\hat{1_{J_0}}(4) both nonzero. Indeed, \\hat{1_{J_0}}(t)=(1+e^{-\u03c0 i t})\\hat{1_U}(t), so it suffices to show \\hat{1_U}(2),\\hat{1_U}(4)\u22600. Direct computation yields\n  \\hat{1_U}(2) \u2248 0.01787 \u2212 0.10419 i,  \\hat{1_U}(4) \u2248 \u22120.05229 \u2212 0.07196 i,\n  hence \\hat{1_{J_0}}(2)\u22480.03573\u22120.20838 i and \\hat{1_{J_0}}(4)\u2248\u22120.10458\u22120.14391 i. By the Fourier complement lemma (already recorded in notes), the existence of \u03b4 with J_0+\u03b4=S^1\\J_0 a.e. would force e^{2\u03c0 i t \u03b4}=\u22121 for all t with \\hat{1_{J_0}}(t)\u22600, impossible for t=2 and t=4 simultaneously. Thus J_0 has no two-translate complement, validating Theorem A\u2019s non-column step via Fourier as an alternative to component-lengths.\n  Why useful here. It provides a concrete, fully checkable obstruction for the numeric Theorem A instance.\n\nExamples and quick checks\n- Theorem A instance (as in output.md). The explicit Fourier values above certify the \u201cno two-translate\u201d hypothesis; T_\u03b1 and T_{\u03b1+1/2} are singleton tilings; Lemma B gives irreducibility; incommensurability by Lemma R.\n- K={0,1,2} instance. Take c_1=c_3=2/5, c_2=1/5. Pick \u03b2=\u221a2/10 so that s/\u03b2= (2/5)/(\u221a2/10)=4/\u221a2=2\u221a2\u2209Q; then \u03b2/(\u03b2\u2212s) is irrational by Lemma Q. Non-column holds by Lemma E (1/c_1=5/2\u2209N). Irreducible by Lemma B.\n\nCorrections and obstacles (what failed and how we fixed it)\n- Earlier \u201crigidity\u201d attempt (all increments equal) is false in general: Proposition K shows any sequence of increments in Stab(J_0) works in the singleton regime. Constant increments are just a special (periodic) case.\n- The |J_0|=1/2 rigidity in Proposition I necessarily uses a further obstruction (no two-translate tiling for J_0); Lemma S shows an alternative path to singleton-per-row when either reciprocal measure is not an integer.\n\nWhat to add/adjust in output.md (gaps and suggested insertions)\n- Add Lemma S (singleton rigidity under 1/(1\u2212|J_0|)\u2209N or 1/|J_0|\u2209N). It provides a simple, general route to singleton-per-row for complementary tiles beyond |J_0|=1/2.\n- Add Proposition K (meandering classification) to make explicit that all singleton tilings for the complementary construction are parameterized by sequences in Stab(J_0); note that periodic sequences yield the families in Theorem A and Proposition G.\n- In Proposition H, mention the alternative incommensurability criterion \u201cs/\u03b2\u2209Q\u201d (Lemma Q), allowing s arbitrary by a suitable choice of \u03b2.\n- Optionally include the explicit Fourier check for the Theorem A example (Lemma F2) as an alternative to the component-length argument in (iii).\n\nNext steps (concrete, testable)\n- Formalize a \u201cq-phase meandering classification\u201d: with Stab(J_0)=(1/q)Z, characterize all periods arising from sequences \u03b4_n taking values in (1/q)Z (e.g., constant sequences give periods (1,\u03b1+j/q), periodic \u03b4_n of period r give periods (r, r\u03b1 + sum \u03b4_n), etc.).\n- For K={0,1,2}, explore simultaneous compatibility for more than two orders and derive the associated linear relations among slopes; combine with Lemma E to obtain multi-period families, aiming at three or more pairwise incommensurable periods.\n- Strengthen the Fourier obstruction into a general \u201cno m-translate partition\u201d test for |J_0|=1/m, recording explicit coefficient constraints and supplying at least one fully worked example for m=3.\n"
