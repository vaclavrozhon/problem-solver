The proof (both directions) implicitly uses that \u03b8_n\u2212\u03b8_{n\u22121} is constant in n (so that \u03b8_{m\u2212k_i}\u2212\u03b8_{m\u2212k_{\u03c3(i)}}=(k_{\u03c3(i)}\u2212k_i)\u03b2). This is guaranteed when 1\u2208K (or more generally when H:=\u27e8K\u2212K\u27e9=Z and one anchors the order consistently to deduce helical behavior). Suggest explicitly adding the hypothesis \u201c1\u2208K\u201d (as in our applications K={0,1} and {0,1,2}) or appending a brief pre-lemma: fixed cyclic order across rows implies helical phases when H=Z.\n- Measure identity at a row. The Additional tools section correctly uses the aggregated layer measures \u03bc_k:=|J_k| to write \u2211_k \u03bc_k d_{m\u2212k} = 1, which is robust even if, within a height k, multiple arcs in A overlap. The \u201cBasic facts\u201d line in notes.md stating \u2211_i |T_{m\u2212k_i}|(b_i\u2212a_i)=1 tacitly assumes within-height disjointness; I recommend consistently using the aggregated form (as in output.md) throughout to avoid ambiguity.\n\nNew results (incremental, auditable)\n1) General singleton rigidity for complementary two-layer tiles under a mild anti-m-tiling hypothesis\n- Proposition K (singleton rigidity beyond |J_0|=1/2). Let A=({0}\u00d7J_0)\u222a({1}\u00d7J_1) with J_1:=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1). Suppose both J_0 and J_1 fail to admit any m-fold translational tiling of S^1 by pairwise a.e. disjoint translates, for every m\u22652. Then any tiling A+T=Z\u00d7S^1 satisfies |T_n|=1 for all n.\n  Proof. For row m, set d_m:=|T_m|, U_m:=\u22c3_{\u03b8\u2208T_m} (J_0+\u03b8) and V_m:=\u22c3_{\u03b8\u2208T_{m\u22121}} (J_1+\u03b8). As before, U_m\u2294V_m=S^1 a.e. and also U_m=\u22c2_{\u03b8\u2208T_{m\u22121}} (J_0+\u03b1+\u03b8) a.e. If d_{m\u22121}\u22652 then T_{m\u22121} contains \u03b8\u2260\u03b8\u2032 with \u03b8\u2032\u2212\u03b8\u2209Stab(J_1)=Stab(J_0) (else the two copies of J_1 would coincide a.e., violating a.e. disjointness). Hence the intersection of J_0+\u03b1+\u03b8 and J_0+\u03b1+\u03b8\u2032 has measure strictly less than |J_0|, so |U_m|<|J_0| and therefore d_m\u00b7|J_0|=|U_m|<|J_0|, forcing d_m=0. But then V_m=S^1, so S^1 is the a.e. disjoint union of d_{m\u22121} copies of J_1; thus d_{m\u22121}=1/|J_1|\u2208N and J_1 m-tiles S^1\u2014a contradiction. Therefore d_{m\u22121}\u22641. By symmetry, d_m\u22641 for all m. Finally, d_{m\u22121}=0 is impossible: it would force U_m=S^1 and thus d_m=1/|J_0|\u2208N and an m-fold tiling by translates of J_0, again contradicting the hypothesis. Hence d_{m\u22121}=d_m=1 for all m. \u220e\n  Why useful here. This strictly generalizes Proposition I: it yields |T_n|=1 for every complementary two-layer tile as soon as we forbid any multi-translate partition for J_0 and J_1 (e.g., by choosing |J_0|,|J_1|\u2209{1/m} or via Fourier/component-length obstructions when |J_\u2022|=1/m). It streamlines irreducibility (Lemma B) and supports classification attempts.\n  Corollary K1 (quick criterion). If |J_0|\u2209{1/m} and |J_1|=1\u2212|J_0|\u2209{1/m}, then every tiling by A is singleton-per-row. Combining with Corollary F (non-column when |J_0|\u2209{1/m}) gives a very robust family: non-column, all tilings singleton, and (with J_0+1/q=J_0) q distinct helical periods as in Proposition G.\n\n2) Fourier obstructions to multi-translate partitions (extensions)\n- Lemma (two-translate obstruction, recorded precisely). If E\u2282S^1 and E+\u03b4=S^1\\E a.e., then for all t\u2208Z\\{0} with \\hat{1_E}(t)\u22600 we have e^{2\u03c0 i t \u03b4}=\u22121. In particular, if \\hat{1_E}(t_1) and \\hat{1_E}(t_2) are nonzero for two distinct t\u2019s such that there is no \u03b4 with e^{2\u03c0 i t_1 \u03b4}=e^{2\u03c0 i t_2 \u03b4}=\u22121, then no such \u03b4 exists. This is exactly the tool used implicitly in Theorem A; keeping it explicit helps certify the \u201cno two-translate\u201d hypothesis when |J_0|=1/2.\n- Lemma (three-translate obstruction). Suppose E\u2282S^1 and there exist t with \\hat{1_E}(t)\u22600 and \\hat{1_E}(2t)\u22600. If S^1 is a.e. the disjoint union of three translates E+\u03b4_1, E+\u03b4_2, E+\u03b4_3, then e^{2\u03c0 i t \u03b4_1}+e^{2\u03c0 i t \u03b4_2}+e^{2\u03c0 i t \u03b4_3}=0 and also e^{2\u03c0 i 2t \u03b4_1}+e^{2\u03c0 i 2t \u03b4_2}+e^{2\u03c0 i 2t \u03b4_3}=0. But the second equation reads (e^{2\u03c0 i t \u03b4_1})^2+(e^{2\u03c0 i t \u03b4_2})^2+(e^{2\u03c0 i t \u03b4_3})^2=0, which is incompatible with the first unless the e^{2\u03c0 i t \u03b4_j} are precisely the three cube roots of unity up to a common rotation. In that case the second sum equals 3e^{4\u03c0 i t c}\u22600, contradiction. Hence no 3-translate tiling exists. This gives a quick certificate to forbid 3-fold partitions for concrete E (check two Fourier modes).\n  Why useful here. These Fourier tests let us enforce the hypotheses of Proposition K and Proposition I in concrete examples, especially in the delicate |J_0|=1/m cases where the boundary integrality does not itself obstruct columns.\n\n3) Concrete q=3 example (non-column, three incommensurable periods, all tilings singleton)\n- Pick t:=\u221a2/30 and set U:=[0,t)\u2282[0,1/3). Let J_0:=U\u222a(U+1/3)\u222a(U+2/3). Then |J_0|=3t is irrational and J_0+1/3=J_0. Fix irrational \u03b1 (e.g., \u03b1=\u221a3/10 mod 1) and define J_1:=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1). By Corollary F A:=({0}\u00d7J_0)\u222a({1}\u00d7J_1) is not a column (since |J_0|\u2209{1/m}). By Proposition K every tiling is singleton-per-row. By Proposition G there are three tilings with periods (1,\u03b1+j/3) for j=0,1,2, pairwise incommensurable (Lemma R). This furnishes a clean, fully explicit \u201cmany periods\u201d family.\n\n4) Small elaboration: boundary obstruction for K={0,1,2}, one interval per height\n- Lemma E currently deduces that in any finite-column tiling one must have 1/c_1,1/c_3\u2208N. One can also note the two-sided variant: at the left boundary p we obtain c_1 d_p=1, and at the right boundary q we obtain c_3 d_{q\u22122}=1 with d_p,d_{q\u22122}\u2208N. If c_1 and c_3 are rationally independent (over Q), this yields an immediate contradiction, so A is not a column. This gives another simple non-column certificate for the K={0,1,2} family beyond the condition c_1\u2209{1/m}.\n\nExamples and checks (how to audit)\n- Proposition K sanity check on Theorem A\u2019s tiles. For U as in Theorem A but with |U| chosen so that |J_0|\u2209{1/m}, both J_0 and J_1 have irrational measure and cannot m-tile S^1 for any integer m. Therefore every tiling must be singleton by Proposition K, recovering Proposition I\u2019s conclusion without requiring the special |J_0|=1/2 case.\n- Fourier certificates. For J_0=U\u222a(U+1/2) with U=[0,.2]\u222a[.3,.35], direct interval-Fourier computation shows \\hat{1_{J_0}}(2), \\hat{1_{J_0}}(4)\u22600; hence no \u03b4 with J_0+\u03b4 = S^1\\J_0 exists (two-translate obstruction), validating the \u201cno two-translate\u201d hypothesis in Proposition I.\n\nObstacles and why some routes fail\n- Attempted global classification for complementary two-layer tiles. Corollary J shows \u03b8_m\u2212\u03b8_{m\u22121}\u2208\u03b1+Stab(J_0) for all m. For J_0 with exactly 1/q-periodicity, this pins \u03b8_m\u2212\u03b8_{m\u22121} to \u03b1+(1/q)Z but does not by itself force constancy of the 1/q-offset across m. A direct disjointness argument between neighboring anchors does not exclude variations because J_1+\u03b8_m and J_0+\u03b8_{m+1} are complementary regardless of the 1/q-offset. Proving constancy seems to require an additional nondegeneracy (e.g., constraining boundary propagation) or a more delicate combinatorial argument across multiple rows.\n\nNext steps (concrete, testable)\n- Insert Proposition K into output.md: it unifies and extends the singleton rigidity statements (beyond |J_0|=1/2) under a clear, checkable hypothesis (no m-fold partitions for J_0 and J_1). Include its short proof.\n- Add the m=3 Fourier obstruction lemma (above) to the tools list, next to the two-translate version. This will cover more corner cases where |J_0| or |J_1| happens to be 1/3.\n- Clarify Lemma C\u2019s hypothesis: add \u201cassume 1\u2208K\u201d (as used throughout), or precede it with a short lemma that fixed order implies helical phases when H=Z.\n- Classification target. Under J_0 with minimal translational invariance (1/q) and with the anti-m-tiling hypothesis (so d_n\u22611), attempt to show the 1/q-offset is constant by tracking boundary points across three consecutive rows and exploiting the fact that two distinct offsets would yield an overlap at a shared row. I will try to formalize this three-row argument next.\n"
