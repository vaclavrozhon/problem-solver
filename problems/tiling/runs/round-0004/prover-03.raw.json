The proof (both directions) implicitly uses that θ_n−θ_{n−1} is constant in n (so that θ_{m−k_i}−θ_{m−k_{σ(i)}}=(k_{σ(i)}−k_i)β). This is guaranteed when 1∈K (or more generally when H:=⟨K−K⟩=Z and one anchors the order consistently to deduce helical behavior). Suggest explicitly adding the hypothesis “1∈K” (as in our applications K={0,1} and {0,1,2}) or appending a brief pre-lemma: fixed cyclic order across rows implies helical phases when H=Z.\\n- Measure identity at a row. The Additional tools section correctly uses the aggregated layer measures μ_k:=|J_k| to write ∑_k μ_k d_{m−k} = 1, which is robust even if, within a height k, multiple arcs in A overlap. The “Basic facts” line in notes.md stating ∑_i |T_{m−k_i}|(b_i−a_i)=1 tacitly assumes within-height disjointness; I recommend consistently using the aggregated form (as in output.md) throughout to avoid ambiguity.\\n\\nNew results (incremental, auditable)\\n1) General singleton rigidity for complementary two-layer tiles under a mild anti-m-tiling hypothesis\\n- Proposition K (singleton rigidity beyond |J_0|=1/2). Let A=({0}×J_0)∪({1}×J_1) with J_1:=S^1\\\\(J_0+α). Suppose both J_0 and J_1 fail to admit any m-fold translational tiling of S^1 by pairwise a.e. disjoint translates, for every m≥2. Then any tiling A+T=Z×S^1 satisfies |T_n|=1 for all n.\\n  Proof. For row m, set d_m:=|T_m|, U_m:=⋃_{θ∈T_m} (J_0+θ) and V_m:=⋃_{θ∈T_{m−1}} (J_1+θ). As before, U_m⊔V_m=S^1 a.e. and also U_m=⋂_{θ∈T_{m−1}} (J_0+α+θ) a.e. If d_{m−1}≥2 then T_{m−1} contains θ≠θ′ with θ′−θ∉Stab(J_1)=Stab(J_0) (else the two copies of J_1 would coincide a.e., violating a.e. disjointness). Hence the intersection of J_0+α+θ and J_0+α+θ′ has measure strictly less than |J_0|, so |U_m|<|J_0| and therefore d_m·|J_0|=|U_m|<|J_0|, forcing d_m=0. But then V_m=S^1, so S^1 is the a.e. disjoint union of d_{m−1} copies of J_1; thus d_{m−1}=1/|J_1|∈N and J_1 m-tiles S^1—a contradiction. Therefore d_{m−1}≤1. By symmetry, d_m≤1 for all m. Finally, d_{m−1}=0 is impossible: it would force U_m=S^1 and thus d_m=1/|J_0|∈N and an m-fold tiling by translates of J_0, again contradicting the hypothesis. Hence d_{m−1}=d_m=1 for all m. ∎\\n  Why useful here. This strictly generalizes Proposition I: it yields |T_n|=1 for every complementary two-layer tile as soon as we forbid any multi-translate partition for J_0 and J_1 (e.g., by choosing |J_0|,|J_1|∉{1/m} or via Fourier/component-length obstructions when |J_•|=1/m). It streamlines irreducibility (Lemma B) and supports classification attempts.\\n  Corollary K1 (quick criterion). If |J_0|∉{1/m} and |J_1|=1−|J_0|∉{1/m}, then every tiling by A is singleton-per-row. Combining with Corollary F (non-column when |J_0|∉{1/m}) gives a very robust family: non-column, all tilings singleton, and (with J_0+1/q=J_0) q distinct helical periods as in Proposition G.\\n\\n2) Fourier obstructions to multi-translate partitions (extensions)\\n- Lemma (two-translate obstruction, recorded precisely). If E⊂S^1 and E+δ=S^1\\\\E a.e., then for all t∈Z\\\\{0} with \\\\hat{1_E}(t)≠0 we have e^{2π i t δ}=−1. In particular, if \\\\hat{1_E}(t_1) and \\\\hat{1_E}(t_2) are nonzero for two distinct t’s such that there is no δ with e^{2π i t_1 δ}=e^{2π i t_2 δ}=−1, then no such δ exists. This is exactly the tool used implicitly in Theorem A; keeping it explicit helps certify the “no two-translate” hypothesis when |J_0|=1/2.\\n- Lemma (three-translate obstruction). Suppose E⊂S^1 and there exist t with \\\\hat{1_E}(t)≠0 and \\\\hat{1_E}(2t)≠0. If S^1 is a.e. the disjoint union of three translates E+δ_1, E+δ_2, E+δ_3, then e^{2π i t δ_1}+e^{2π i t δ_2}+e^{2π i t δ_3}=0 and also e^{2π i 2t δ_1}+e^{2π i 2t δ_2}+e^{2π i 2t δ_3}=0. But the second equation reads (e^{2π i t δ_1})^2+(e^{2π i t δ_2})^2+(e^{2π i t δ_3})^2=0, which is incompatible with the first unless the e^{2π i t δ_j} are precisely the three cube roots of unity up to a common rotation. In that case the second sum equals 3e^{4π i t c}≠0, contradiction. Hence no 3-translate tiling exists. This gives a quick certificate to forbid 3-fold partitions for concrete E (check two Fourier modes).\\n  Why useful here. These Fourier tests let us enforce the hypotheses of Proposition K and Proposition I in concrete examples, especially in the delicate |J_0|=1/m cases where the boundary integrality does not itself obstruct columns.\\n\\n3) Concrete q=3 example (non-column, three incommensurable periods, all tilings singleton)\\n- Pick t:=√2/30 and set U:=[0,t)⊂[0,1/3). Let J_0:=U∪(U+1/3)∪(U+2/3). Then |J_0|=3t is irrational and J_0+1/3=J_0. Fix irrational α (e.g., α=√3/10 mod 1) and define J_1:=S^1\\\\(J_0+α). By Corollary F A:=({0}×J_0)∪({1}×J_1) is not a column (since |J_0|∉{1/m}). By Proposition K every tiling is singleton-per-row. By Proposition G there are three tilings with periods (1,α+j/3) for j=0,1,2, pairwise incommensurable (Lemma R). This furnishes a clean, fully explicit “many periods” family.\\n\\n4) Small elaboration: boundary obstruction for K={0,1,2}, one interval per height\\n- Lemma E currently deduces that in any finite-column tiling one must have 1/c_1,1/c_3∈N. One can also note the two-sided variant: at the left boundary p we obtain c_1 d_p=1, and at the right boundary q we obtain c_3 d_{q−2}=1 with d_p,d_{q−2}∈N. If c_1 and c_3 are rationally independent (over Q), this yields an immediate contradiction, so A is not a column. This gives another simple non-column certificate for the K={0,1,2} family beyond the condition c_1∉{1/m}.\\n\\nExamples and checks (how to audit)\\n- Proposition K sanity check on Theorem A’s tiles. For U as in Theorem A but with |U| chosen so that |J_0|∉{1/m}, both J_0 and J_1 have irrational measure and cannot m-tile S^1 for any integer m. Therefore every tiling must be singleton by Proposition K, recovering Proposition I’s conclusion without requiring the special |J_0|=1/2 case.\\n- Fourier certificates. For J_0=U∪(U+1/2) with U=[0,.2]∪[.3,.35], direct interval-Fourier computation shows \\\\hat{1_{J_0}}(2), \\\\hat{1_{J_0}}(4)≠0; hence no δ with J_0+δ = S^1\\\\J_0 exists (two-translate obstruction), validating the “no two-translate” hypothesis in Proposition I.\\n\\nObstacles and why some routes fail\\n- Attempted global classification for complementary two-layer tiles. Corollary J shows θ_m−θ_{m−1}∈α+Stab(J_0) for all m. For J_0 with exactly 1/q-periodicity, this pins θ_m−θ_{m−1} to α+(1/q)Z but does not by itself force constancy of the 1/q-offset across m. A direct disjointness argument between neighboring anchors does not exclude variations because J_1+θ_m and J_0+θ_{m+1} are complementary regardless of the 1/q-offset. Proving constancy seems to require an additional nondegeneracy (e.g., constraining boundary propagation) or a more delicate combinatorial argument across multiple rows.\\n\\nNext steps (concrete, testable)\\n- Insert Proposition K into output.md: it unifies and extends the singleton rigidity statements (beyond |J_0|=1/2) under a clear, checkable hypothesis (no m-fold partitions for J_0 and J_1). Include its short proof.\\n- Add the m=3 Fourier obstruction lemma (above) to the tools list, next to the two-translate version. This will cover more corner cases where |J_0| or |J_1| happens to be 1/3.\\n- Clarify Lemma C’s hypothesis: add “assume 1∈K” (as used throughout), or precede it with a short lemma that fixed order implies helical phases when H=Z.\\n- Classification target. Under J_0 with minimal translational invariance (1/q) and with the anti-m-tiling hypothesis (so d_n≡1), attempt to show the 1/q-offset is constant by tracking boundary points across three consecutive rows and exploiting the fact that two distinct offsets would yield an overlap at a shared row. I will try to formalize this three-row argument next.\\n\"}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"auto","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"ProverOutput","schema_":{"properties":{"progress_md":{"description":"Append-only progress notes","title":"Progress Md","type":"string"}},"required":["progress_md"],"title":"ProverOutput","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":31630,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":17287,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":14656},"total_tokens":48917},"user":null,"store":true}
