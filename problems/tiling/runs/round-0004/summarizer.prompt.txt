Round 0004 — audit, corrections, and new small results (measurable, checkable)

Quick audit of output.md (what’s solid; small clarifications)
- Theorem A: Correct construction; two tilings T_α and T_{α+1/2} exist, are singleton, hence irreducible by Lemma B. Non-column proof via the “two-translate impossibility” is sound because at the left boundary one forces two a.e. disjoint translates of J_0 to cover S^1. The endpoint issue is already covered by the “Remark on endpoints.” A small presentational note: the parenthetical “(iii) can also be deduced from Corollary F by instead choosing |J_0|∉{1/m})” refers to a variant of the theorem (with |J_0| not fixed to 1/2); as written, (iii) is proven via the component-length obstruction.
- Proposition H: The incommensurability clause correctly assumes s rational. We record below a slightly more flexible sufficient condition (s/β ∉ Q), which can be used to ensure incommensurability for arbitrary s by choosing β appropriately.
- Proposition I: Good fix of an earlier overreach; the additional hypothesis “no two-translate partition of S^1 by J_0” is essential in the |J_0|=1/2 case.

New small lemmas/propositions (auditable, with short proofs)
1) Singleton rigidity for complementary two-layer tiles under a mild integrality exclusion.
- Lemma S. Let A=({0}×J_0)∪({1}×J_1) with J_1=S^1\(J_0+α). If either 1/(1−|J_0|)∉N or 1/|J_0|∉N, then every tiling A+T=Z×S^1 satisfies |T_n|=1 for all n.
  Proof. Let d_n:=|T_n|. The per-row measure identity yields |J_0| d_n + (1−|J_0|) d_{n−1} = 1 for all n. The intersection identity (recorded in output.md) implies: if d_{n−1}≥1 then d_n≤1. If 1/(1−|J_0|)∉N and some d_m=0, then (1−|J_0|) d_{m−1}=1 forces a contradiction; hence d_n≥1 for all n, thus d_n≤1 by the previous inequality, so d_n=1. Symmetrically, if 1/|J_0|∉N and some d_{m−1}=0, then |J_0| d_m=1 contradicts integrality; shifting indices gives d_n≥1 for all n, hence d_n=1 by the inequality. ∎
  Why useful here. This supplies an easy route to singleton-per-row (hence irreducibility) for many complementary tiles without invoking the two-translate obstruction; it also streamlines non-column arguments when combined with Lemma B.

2) Meandering classification of singleton tilings for the complementary construction.
- Proposition K (classification). Let A=({0}×J_0)∪({1}×J_1) with J_1=S^1\(J_0+α). Assume a tiling is singleton-per-row, T_n={θ_n}. Then for every n one has J_0+θ_n = J_0+(α+θ_{n−1}) a.e., i.e. δ_n:=θ_n−θ_{n−1}−α ∈ Stab(J_0):={t: J_0+t=J_0 a.e.}. Conversely, for any sequence (δ_n) with values in Stab(J_0), the sequence defined by θ_n:=θ_0+∑_{j=1}^n(α+δ_j) yields a singleton tiling T={ (n,θ_n) }.
  Proof. The “only if” direction is Corollary J. For the converse, on row n we have J_0+θ_n and J_1+θ_{n−1}=S^1\(J_0+α+θ_{n−1}). Since δ_n∈Stab(J_0), J_0+θ_n=J_0+α+θ_{n−1}+δ_n=J_0+α+θ_{n−1} a.e., so the two contributions are complementary a.e. Pairwise a.e. disjointness holds because different anchors contribute on disjoint rows or contribute complementary sets on the same row. ∎
  Why useful here. This shows there are many (generally aperiodic) irreducible singleton tilings for complementary two-layer tiles; periodic choices correspond to δ_n constant, recovering the families in Theorem A and Proposition G. It corrects a prior (overly rigid) heuristic that increments must be constant.

3) Flexible incommensurability for the K={0,1,2} two-order family.
- Lemma Q. If s∈(0,1) and β∉Q satisfy s/β∉Q, then β/(β−s)∉Q.
  Proof. If β/(β−s)=p/q∈Q, then (q−p)β=ps, so s/β=(q−p)/p∈Q, contradiction. ∎
  Why useful here. Proposition H can achieve incommensurability without assuming s rational by choosing β so that s/β∉Q (e.g., β irrational and rationally independent from s).

4) Fourier obstruction to two-translate complement (explicit numeric check for Theorem A’s U).
- Lemma F2 (explicit check). For U=[0,0.2]∪[0.3,0.35] and J_0:=U∪(U+1/2), one has \hat{1_{J_0}}(2) and \hat{1_{J_0}}(4) both nonzero. Indeed, \hat{1_{J_0}}(t)=(1+e^{-π i t})\hat{1_U}(t), so it suffices to show \hat{1_U}(2),\hat{1_U}(4)≠0. Direct computation yields
  \hat{1_U}(2) ≈ 0.01787 − 0.10419 i,  \hat{1_U}(4) ≈ −0.05229 − 0.07196 i,
  hence \hat{1_{J_0}}(2)≈0.03573−0.20838 i and \hat{1_{J_0}}(4)≈−0.10458−0.14391 i. By the Fourier complement lemma (already recorded in notes), the existence of δ with J_0+δ=S^1\J_0 a.e. would force e^{2π i t δ}=−1 for all t with \hat{1_{J_0}}(t)≠0, impossible for t=2 and t=4 simultaneously. Thus J_0 has no two-translate complement, validating Theorem A’s non-column step via Fourier as an alternative to component-lengths.
  Why useful here. It provides a concrete, fully checkable obstruction for the numeric Theorem A instance.

Examples and quick checks
- Theorem A instance (as in output.md). The explicit Fourier values above certify the “no two-translate” hypothesis; T_α and T_{α+1/2} are singleton tilings; Lemma B gives irreducibility; incommensurability by Lemma R.
- K={0,1,2} instance. Take c_1=c_3=2/5, c_2=1/5. Pick β=√2/10 so that s/β= (2/5)/(√2/10)=4/√2=2√2∉Q; then β/(β−s) is irrational by Lemma Q. Non-column holds by Lemma E (1/c_1=5/2∉N). Irreducible by Lemma B.

Corrections and obstacles (what failed and how we fixed it)
- Earlier “rigidity” attempt (all increments equal) is false in general: Proposition K shows any sequence of increments in Stab(J_0) works in the singleton regime. Constant increments are just a special (periodic) case.
- The |J_0|=1/2 rigidity in Proposition I necessarily uses a further obstruction (no two-translate tiling for J_0); Lemma S shows an alternative path to singleton-per-row when either reciprocal measure is not an integer.

What to add/adjust in output.md (gaps and suggested insertions)
- Add Lemma S (singleton rigidity under 1/(1−|J_0|)∉N or 1/|J_0|∉N). It provides a simple, general route to singleton-per-row for complementary tiles beyond |J_0|=1/2.
- Add Proposition K (meandering classification) to make explicit that all singleton tilings for the complementary construction are parameterized by sequences in Stab(J_0); note that periodic sequences yield the families in Theorem A and Proposition G.
- In Proposition H, mention the alternative incommensurability criterion “s/β∉Q” (Lemma Q), allowing s arbitrary by a suitable choice of β.
- Optionally include the explicit Fourier check for the Theorem A example (Lemma F2) as an alternative to the component-length argument in (iii).

Next steps (concrete, testable)
- Formalize a “q-phase meandering classification”: with Stab(J_0)=(1/q)Z, characterize all periods arising from sequences δ_n taking values in (1/q)Z (e.g., constant sequences give periods (1,α+j/q), periodic δ_n of period r give periods (r, rα + sum δ_n), etc.).
- For K={0,1,2}, explore simultaneous compatibility for more than two orders and derive the associated linear relations among slopes; combine with Lemma E to obtain multi-period families, aiming at three or more pairwise incommensurable periods.
- Strengthen the Fourier obstruction into a general “no m-translate partition” test for |J_0|=1/m, recording explicit coefficient constraints and supplying at least one fully worked example for m=3.

Round 0004 — audit, tightenings, and small new results/lemmas

Audit of output.md (gaps and clarifications)
- Theorem A, item (iii) remark. The proof of non-columnity (for the specific choice |J_0|=1/2) is correct via the component-length obstruction. The parenthetical remark “(iii) can also be deduced from Corollary F by instead choosing |J_0|∉{1/m}” changes the construction (different J_0). That is fine as a variant, but strictly it does not prove (iii) for the J_0 fixed in Theorem A. Suggest: move this to a separate “variant” remark (Theorem A′) where we choose |U|≠1/4 so that |J_0|=2|U|∉{1/m} and appeal directly to Corollary F.
- Proposition I (“singleton rigidity,” |J_0|=1/2). The step “Similarly, d_n=0 is impossible” tacitly uses that J_1 cannot admit a two-translate partition of S^1. This follows from the assumption on J_0 because E+δ=S^1\E iff (S^1\E)+δ=E. Since J_1=(S^1\J_0)+α is a translate of S^1\J_0, forbidding J_0 ⊔ (J_0+δ)=S^1 automatically forbids J_1 ⊔ (J_1+δ′)=S^1. Suggest adding this one-line justification explicitly.
- Lemma E (Boundary obstruction). In output.md it is labeled “As before.” To avoid cross-referencing, I recommend restating the lemma explicitly: if k_min:=min K and μ_min:=|⋃_{i: k_i=k_min}[a_i,b_i]|, then for any finite-column tiling A+T=X×S^1 with p:=min X we must have d_{p−k_min}·μ_min=1 (hence 1/μ_min∈N); similarly at the right boundary with k_max.
- Endpoint convention is consistently addressed; OK.

New results and refinements (small, auditable)
1) Fourier obstruction to two-translate complements (formal statement and proof)
- Lemma (Fourier two-copy obstruction). Let E⊂S^1 be measurable. If there exists δ with E+δ = S^1\E a.e., then for every nonzero t∈Z with \hat{1_E}(t)≠0 we have e^{2\pi i t δ} = −1. In particular, if \hat{1_E}(2) and \hat{1_E}(4) are both nonzero, such a δ cannot exist.
  Proof. Taking Fourier coefficients in 1_{E+δ}+1_E=1 yields e^{2\pi i t δ} \hat{1_E}(t)+\hat{1_E}(t)=0 for all t≠0, hence the first claim. For t=2 and t=4 this would force e^{4\pi i δ}=−1 and e^{8\pi i δ}=−1 simultaneously, which is impossible. ∎
- Why useful here. This cleanly certifies the “no two-translate” hypothesis in Proposition I for many explicit J_0. For example, if J_0=U∪(U+1/2) with U=[0,c) and c∉Q, then \hat{1_{J_0}}(2)=2\hat{1_U}(2)=(e^{4\pi i c}−1)/(2\pi i)≠0 and similarly \hat{1_{J_0}}(4)≠0, hence no δ with J_0+δ=S^1\J_0 exists. This provides an alternate, short certification for the concrete tiles used in Theorem A (if we take U with irrational length).

2) Boundary obstruction (general K, explicit statement)
- Lemma (Boundary integrality, general form). Let A=\bigcup_i\{k_i\}×[a_i,b_i], and for each height k define the aggregated layer J_k:=⋃_{i: k_i=k}[a_i,b_i] with μ_k:=|J_k|. Suppose A+T=X×S^1 with X finite and let d_n:=|T_n|. If p:=min X and k_min:=min\{k_i\}, then only anchors z=p−k_min can contribute to row p, hence d_{p−k_min}·μ_{k_min}=1. Symmetrically, with q:=max X and k_max:=max\{k_i\}, we have d_{q−k_max}·μ_{k_max}=1. In particular, if 1/μ_{k_min}∉N or 1/μ_{k_max}∉N, A is not a column.
  Proof. Standard localization at the boundary: any anchor z<p−k_min would create coverage below p; any anchor z=p−k with k>k_min would create coverage at row p−(k−k_min)<p. Thus row p is covered solely by d_{p−k_min} disjoint translates of J_{k_min}, forcing the identity. The right boundary is analogous. ∎
- This subsumes Lemma E and makes the obstruction reusable for arbitrary K (not only {0,1,2}).

3) Classification in the complementary two-layer setting (|J_0|=1/2)
- Proposition (Increment parameterization under singleton and complementarity). Let A=({0}×J_0)∪({1}×J_1) with J_1=S^1\(J_0+α) and |J_0|=|J_1|=1/2. Assume J_0 admits no two-translate tiling. Then every tiling A+T=Z×S^1 is singleton per row (Proposition I), and is determined by a sequence (θ_m)_{m∈Z} with the recursion
  θ_{m}−θ_{m−1} ∈ α + Stab(J_0)  for all m,
  where Stab(J_0):=\{t∈S^1: J_0+t=J_0 a.e.\}. Conversely, any bi-infinite sequence (θ_m) obeying this recursion defines a tiling. In particular, if J_0 has exactly 1/2-periodicity (Stab(J_0)={0,1/2}+Z), the allowable increments are α or α+1/2 independently at each step m.
  Proof. Proposition I gives |T_m|≡1. Row m’s identity U_m=J_0+θ_m=S^1\V_m and V_m=J_1+θ_{m−1}=S^1\(J_0+α+θ_{m−1}) forces J_0+θ_m=J_0+α+θ_{m−1} a.e., hence the increment constraint. Conversely, given any sequence satisfying the constraint, the two sets J_0+θ_m and J_1+θ_{m−1} are complementary in row m, providing a tiling with a.e. disjointness. ∎
- Why this matters. It shows Theorem A’s complementary construction has a large family of (irreducible) tilings, encompassing the helical tilings T_α and T_{α+1/2} as the constant-increment choices. This also clarifies that demanding a specific period further fixes the increment to be constant.

4) Worked explicit choices ensuring “no two-translate” via Fourier
- Example. Take U=[0,c) with c=\sqrt{2}/10. Then J_0:=U∪(U+1/2) has \hat{1_{J_0}}(2)=2\hat{1_U}(2)=(e^{4\pi i c}−1)/(2\pi i)≠0 and \hat{1_{J_0}}(4)=2\hat{1_U}(4)=(e^{8\pi i c}−1)/(4\pi i)≠0 (since 2c,4c∉Z). By the Fourier lemma, J_0 admits no δ with J_0+δ=S^1\J_0. Thus Proposition I applies. Picking any irrational α then produces two irreducible tilings with periods (1,α) and (1,α+1/2), incommensurable by Lemma R.

Small corrections/caveats to record
- Proposition H (K={0,1,2} two-order family): the incommensurability clause correctly keeps s rational. Removing that hypothesis can fail (counterexample: β=\sqrt{2}, s=β/2 gives β/(β−s)=2∈Q).
- As noted above, J_1 has a two-translate tiling iff J_0 does (since J_1=(S^1\J_0)+α). This justifies the symmetry step in Proposition I’s proof.

Why these additions advance the program
- They provide a compact, verifiable obstruction (Fourier) to the only delicate step in the |J_0|=1/2 regime (ruling out 2-fold partitions), applicable to many explicit U. This simplifies checking Theorem A (iii) concretely.
- The general boundary lemma is a reusable tool beyond K={0,1,2}, and makes non-column checks almost mechanical for many tiles.
- The increment-parameterization proposition clarifies the full family of tilings for the complementary construction (in the singleton regime), isolating the exact freedom and showing how the helical tilings sit inside it. This aligns with Corollary J and avoids overclaiming uniqueness.

Ideas to pursue next (auditable targets)
- Record the Fourier lemma as a formal tool in output.md and apply it to a few concrete U (single-interval U with irrational length, or two-interval U with simple rational endpoints), computing \hat{1_{J_0}}(2), \hat{1_{J_0}}(4) explicitly to certify non-columnity in Theorem A.
- State and prove the boundary integrality lemma (general K) explicitly in output.md and reference it in Proposition H, replacing “As before.”
- Multi-order extensions beyond K={0,1,2}: using Lemma C, list all σ for ℓ=4 with K={0,1,2,3} and compute the resulting linear constraints; look for simultaneous compatibilities yielding ≥3 distinct slopes, and then apply the boundary lemma to certify non-columnity (e.g., force 1/μ_{k_min}∉N).
- Quantify incommensurability in the q-phase family: for any irrational α and 0≤j<j′<q, (α+j/q)/(α+j′/q)∉Q by Lemma R; record this explicitly with a short proof in output.md (currently indicated parenthetically under Proposition G).

Potential pitfalls and how we avoid them
- Overclaiming singleton rigidity for general |J_0|. We restrict singleton rigidity to |J_0|=1/2 with a “no 2-translate” hypothesis (Proposition I). For general |J_0|, the boundary equation can allow patterns like (d_m,d_{m−1})=(1/|J_0|,0); forbidding these requires forbidding m-translate tilings for m=1/|J_0| (Fourier can help), but we do not claim this generally here.
- Endpoint issues are kept as a standing a.e. convention; all Fourier arguments rely on L^2-coefficients and are stable under null boundary changes.

Concrete checklist for the verifier
- For the U=[0,\sqrt{2}/10) example, compute \hat{1_{J_0}}(2), \hat{1_{J_0}}(4) explicitly from the single-interval formula and verify they are nonzero; conclude “no two-translate.”
- Insert the explicit statement/proof of the boundary integrality lemma into output.md; confirm Proposition H cites it correctly.
- Add the one-line symmetry justification in Proposition I about J_1 and J_0 two-translate equivalence.
- Optionally, include the increment-parameterization proposition (with its short proof) to make Corollary J’s content explicit as a classification statement in the |J_0|=1/2 complementary case.

Round 0004 — audit, strengthened rigidity, and Fourier obstructions

Audit of output.md (small gaps and clarifications)
- Lemma C (fixed-order singleton congruences). The proof (both directions) implicitly uses that θ_n−θ_{n−1} is constant in n (so that θ_{m−k_i}−θ_{m−k_{σ(i)}}=(k_{σ(i)}−k_i)β). This is guaranteed when 1∈K (or more generally when H:=⟨K−K⟩=Z and one anchors the order consistently to deduce helical behavior). Suggest explicitly adding the hypothesis “1∈K” (as in our applications K={0,1} and {0,1,2}) or appending a brief pre-lemma: fixed cyclic order across rows implies helical phases when H=Z.
- Measure identity at a row. The Additional tools section correctly uses the aggregated layer measures μ_k:=|J_k| to write ∑_k μ_k d_{m−k} = 1, which is robust even if, within a height k, multiple arcs in A overlap. The “Basic facts” line in notes.md stating ∑_i |T_{m−k_i}|(b_i−a_i)=1 tacitly assumes within-height disjointness; I recommend consistently using the aggregated form (as in output.md) throughout to avoid ambiguity.

New results (incremental, auditable)
1) General singleton rigidity for complementary two-layer tiles under a mild anti-m-tiling hypothesis
- Proposition K (singleton rigidity beyond |J_0|=1/2). Let A=({0}×J_0)∪({1}×J_1) with J_1:=S^1\(J_0+α). Suppose both J_0 and J_1 fail to admit any m-fold translational tiling of S^1 by pairwise a.e. disjoint translates, for every m≥2. Then any tiling A+T=Z×S^1 satisfies |T_n|=1 for all n.
  Proof. For row m, set d_m:=|T_m|, U_m:=⋃_{θ∈T_m} (J_0+θ) and V_m:=⋃_{θ∈T_{m−1}} (J_1+θ). As before, U_m⊔V_m=S^1 a.e. and also U_m=⋂_{θ∈T_{m−1}} (J_0+α+θ) a.e. If d_{m−1}≥2 then T_{m−1} contains θ≠θ′ with θ′−θ∉Stab(J_1)=Stab(J_0) (else the two copies of J_1 would coincide a.e., violating a.e. disjointness). Hence the intersection of J_0+α+θ and J_0+α+θ′ has measure strictly less than |J_0|, so |U_m|<|J_0| and therefore d_m·|J_0|=|U_m|<|J_0|, forcing d_m=0. But then V_m=S^1, so S^1 is the a.e. disjoint union of d_{m−1} copies of J_1; thus d_{m−1}=1/|J_1|∈N and J_1 m-tiles S^1—a contradiction. Therefore d_{m−1}≤1. By symmetry, d_m≤1 for all m. Finally, d_{m−1}=0 is impossible: it would force U_m=S^1 and thus d_m=1/|J_0|∈N and an m-fold tiling by translates of J_0, again contradicting the hypothesis. Hence d_{m−1}=d_m=1 for all m. ∎
  Why useful here. This strictly generalizes Proposition I: it yields |T_n|=1 for every complementary two-layer tile as soon as we forbid any multi-translate partition for J_0 and J_1 (e.g., by choosing |J_0|,|J_1|∉{1/m} or via Fourier/component-length obstructions when |J_•|=1/m). It streamlines irreducibility (Lemma B) and supports classification attempts.
  Corollary K1 (quick criterion). If |J_0|∉{1/m} and |J_1|=1−|J_0|∉{1/m}, then every tiling by A is singleton-per-row. Combining with Corollary F (non-column when |J_0|∉{1/m}) gives a very robust family: non-column, all tilings singleton, and (with J_0+1/q=J_0) q distinct helical periods as in Proposition G.

2) Fourier obstructions to multi-translate partitions (extensions)
- Lemma (two-translate obstruction, recorded precisely). If E⊂S^1 and E+δ=S^1\E a.e., then for all t∈Z\{0} with \hat{1_E}(t)≠0 we have e^{2π i t δ}=−1. In particular, if \hat{1_E}(t_1) and \hat{1_E}(t_2) are nonzero for two distinct t’s such that there is no δ with e^{2π i t_1 δ}=e^{2π i t_2 δ}=−1, then no such δ exists. This is exactly the tool used implicitly in Theorem A; keeping it explicit helps certify the “no two-translate” hypothesis when |J_0|=1/2.
- Lemma (three-translate obstruction). Suppose E⊂S^1 and there exist t with \hat{1_E}(t)≠0 and \hat{1_E}(2t)≠0. If S^1 is a.e. the disjoint union of three translates E+δ_1, E+δ_2, E+δ_3, then e^{2π i t δ_1}+e^{2π i t δ_2}+e^{2π i t δ_3}=0 and also e^{2π i 2t δ_1}+e^{2π i 2t δ_2}+e^{2π i 2t δ_3}=0. But the second equation reads (e^{2π i t δ_1})^2+(e^{2π i t δ_2})^2+(e^{2π i t δ_3})^2=0, which is incompatible with the first unless the e^{2π i t δ_j} are precisely the three cube roots of unity up to a common rotation. In that case the second sum equals 3e^{4π i t c}≠0, contradiction. Hence no 3-translate tiling exists. This gives a quick certificate to forbid 3-fold partitions for concrete E (check two Fourier modes).
  Why useful here. These Fourier tests let us enforce the hypotheses of Proposition K and Proposition I in concrete examples, especially in the delicate |J_0|=1/m cases where the boundary integrality does not itself obstruct columns.

3) Concrete q=3 example (non-column, three incommensurable periods, all tilings singleton)
- Pick t:=√2/30 and set U:=[0,t)⊂[0,1/3). Let J_0:=U∪(U+1/3)∪(U+2/3). Then |J_0|=3t is irrational and J_0+1/3=J_0. Fix irrational α (e.g., α=√3/10 mod 1) and define J_1:=S^1\(J_0+α). By Corollary F A:=({0}×J_0)∪({1}×J_1) is not a column (since |J_0|∉{1/m}). By Proposition K every tiling is singleton-per-row. By Proposition G there are three tilings with periods (1,α+j/3) for j=0,1,2, pairwise incommensurable (Lemma R). This furnishes a clean, fully explicit “many periods” family.

4) Small elaboration: boundary obstruction for K={0,1,2}, one interval per height
- Lemma E currently deduces that in any finite-column tiling one must have 1/c_1,1/c_3∈N. One can also note the two-sided variant: at the left boundary p we obtain c_1 d_p=1, and at the right boundary q we obtain c_3 d_{q−2}=1 with d_p,d_{q−2}∈N. If c_1 and c_3 are rationally independent (over Q), this yields an immediate contradiction, so A is not a column. This gives another simple non-column certificate for the K={0,1,2} family beyond the condition c_1∉{1/m}.

Examples and checks (how to audit)
- Proposition K sanity check on Theorem A’s tiles. For U as in Theorem A but with |U| chosen so that |J_0|∉{1/m}, both J_0 and J_1 have irrational measure and cannot m-tile S^1 for any integer m. Therefore every tiling must be singleton by Proposition K, recovering Proposition I’s conclusion without requiring the special |J_0|=1/2 case.
- Fourier certificates. For J_0=U∪(U+1/2) with U=[0,.2]∪[.3,.35], direct interval-Fourier computation shows \hat{1_{J_0}}(2), \hat{1_{J_0}}(4)≠0; hence no δ with J_0+δ = S^1\J_0 exists (two-translate obstruction), validating the “no two-translate” hypothesis in Proposition I.

Obstacles and why some routes fail
- Attempted global classification for complementary two-layer tiles. Corollary J shows θ_m−θ_{m−1}∈α+Stab(J_0) for all m. For J_0 with exactly 1/q-periodicity, this pins θ_m−θ_{m−1} to α+(1/q)Z but does not by itself force constancy of the 1/q-offset across m. A direct disjointness argument between neighboring anchors does not exclude variations because J_1+θ_m and J_0+θ_{m+1} are complementary regardless of the 1/q-offset. Proving constancy seems to require an additional nondegeneracy (e.g., constraining boundary propagation) or a more delicate combinatorial argument across multiple rows.

Next steps (concrete, testable)
- Insert Proposition K into output.md: it unifies and extends the singleton rigidity statements (beyond |J_0|=1/2) under a clear, checkable hypothesis (no m-fold partitions for J_0 and J_1). Include its short proof.
- Add the m=3 Fourier obstruction lemma (above) to the tools list, next to the two-translate version. This will cover more corner cases where |J_0| or |J_1| happens to be 1/3.
- Clarify Lemma C’s hypothesis: add “assume 1∈K” (as used throughout), or precede it with a short lemma that fixed order implies helical phases when H=Z.
- Classification target. Under J_0 with minimal translational invariance (1/q) and with the anti-m-tiling hypothesis (so d_n≡1), attempt to show the 1/q-offset is constant by tracking boundary points across three consecutive rows and exploiting the fact that two distinct offsets would yield an overlap at a shared row. I will try to formalize this three-row argument next.
