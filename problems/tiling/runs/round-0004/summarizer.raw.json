Main confirmations: Theorem A’s complementary two-layer construction is correct and the two helical tilings T_α and T_{α+1/2} are singleton and irreducible. New/strengthened results include Lemma S (singleton rigidity under integrality exclusions 1/(1−|J_0|)∉N or 1/|J_0|∉N), Proposition K (meandering classification: singleton tilings parameterized by increments δ_n ∈ Stab(J_0)), a generalized singleton rigidity result forbidding any m-fold translational tiling ⇒ |T_n|=1, Fourier two- and three-translate obstructions (with an explicit numeric check Lemma F2 for Theorem A), and a boundary-integrality lemma for general K. Concrete examples (q=3 family) and an incommensurability criterion (Lemma Q: s/β∉Q ⇒ β/(β−s)∉Q) were supplied. Verifier verdict: partial success.
