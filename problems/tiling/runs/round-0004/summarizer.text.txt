  "summary_md": "Round 0004 audited output.md and added several short, checkable lemmas/tools that tighten constructions and non-column arguments. Main confirmations: Theorem A’s complementary two-layer construction is correct and the two helical tilings T_α and T_{α+1/2} are singleton and irreducible. New/strengthened results include Lemma S (singleton rigidity under integrality exclusions 1/(1−|J_0|)∉N or 1/|J_0|∉N), Proposition K (meandering classification: singleton tilings parameterized by increments δ_n ∈ Stab(J_0)), a generalized singleton rigidity result forbidding any m-fold translational tiling ⇒ |T_n|=1, Fourier two- and three-translate obstructions (with an explicit numeric check Lemma F2 for Theorem A), and a boundary-integrality lemma for general K. Concrete examples (q=3 family) and an incommensurability criterion (Lemma Q: s/β∉Q ⇒ β/(β−s)∉Q) were supplied. Verifier verdict: partial success.

  "highlights": [
    "Theorem A validated: explicit Fourier computations (Lemma F2) rule out a two-translate complement for the example J_0, so T_α and T_{α+1/2} are singleton and irreducible.",
    "Lemma S: If 1/(1−|J_0|)∉N or 1/|J_0|∉N, then any tiling by the complementary two-layer A has |T_n|=1 for every row (singleton-per-row rigidity).",
    "Proposition K (classification): all singleton-per-row complementary tilings are obtained from sequences of increments δ_n in Stab(J_0); periodic δ_n recover the helical families.",
    "Generalized singleton rigidity (prover-03): forbidding any m-fold translational tiling of J_0 and J_1 (for m≥2) implies |T_n|=1 for all n—this subsumes the |J_0|∉{1/m} criterion.",
    "Fourier obstructions formalized: two-translate and new three-translate tests (use nonzero Fourier modes at two frequencies to rule out m-fold partitions) produce concrete, checkable certificates.",
    "Boundary integrality lemma for general K: at left/right extremes d·μ_k = 1, so 1/μ_k∈N is necessary for a column; this yields mechanical non-column checks (used in K={0,1,2} examples)."

    "Insert the new formal statements/proofs (Lemma S, the generalized singleton rigidity proposition, Proposition K, the Fourier two-/three-translate lemmas, and the boundary-integrality lemma) into output.md and rerun verification with explicit Fourier numerics for the Theorem A example.",
    "Formalize the q-phase 'meandering' classification: characterize all periods arising when Stab(J_0)=(1/q)Z and determine under what minimal extra hypotheses the 1/q-offset must be constant (i.e., force constant increments).",
    "Extend the multi-order exploration (K≥3): search for constructions with ≥3 pairwise incommensurable periods and certify non-columnity using the boundary integrality and Fourier obstruction tests."
