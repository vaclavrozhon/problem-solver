  "feedback_md": "Overall, the three reports are consistent with our current framework and add several genuinely useful, checkable tools. The main strengths are: (i) a clean Fourier \u201ctwo-translate\u201d obstruction lemma (P02, P03), with a concrete way to certify the delicate step in the |J_0|=1/2 complementary construction; (ii) two singletons-per-row rigidity results for complementary two-layer tiles: a quick integrality-based criterion (P01\u2019s Lemma S) and a stronger hypothesis that forbids any m-fold translational partitions of J_0 and J_1 for m\u22652 (P03\u2019s Proposition K), both with short, correct proofs; (iii) a clear classification of singleton tilings in the complementary construction via the stabilizer Stab(J_0) (P01 Proposition K), which generalizes our Corollary J and anchors the \u201cmeandering\u201d picture; (iv) a simple incommensurability algebra (P01 Lemma Q) that allows avoiding the \u201cs rational\u201d restriction in Proposition H by appropriate choice of \u03b2.\n\nRigor audit and corrections:\n- Lemma C in output.md implicitly used that \u03b8_n\u2212\u03b8_{n\u22121} is constant. This is guaranteed when 1\u2208K (or more generally under a helical-phase conclusion). We should explicitly note this assumption. I add a clarification remark rather than removing the lemma, since all our uses have 1\u2208K (K={0,1} or {0,1,2}).\n- Boundary obstruction: output.md still says \u201cLemma E (As before)\u201d. I\u2019ve inserted the explicit general (\u201caggregated-measure\u201d) statement with proof. This removes the cross-reference ambiguity and upgrades the tool for arbitrary K.\n- Proposition I (|J_0|=1/2 singleton rigidity): the \u201cSimilarly, d_n=0 is impossible\u201d step relies on the obvious equivalence that J_1 admits a 2-translate partition iff J_0 does. I include this one-line justification as an addendum.\n- The Fourier two-translate obstruction is formalized and added (with proof). Numeric checks such as P01\u2019s Lemma F2 are fine for notes, but output.md only records the general lemma plus a simple explicit class (U=[0,c), c irrational) as a worked example in notes.\n\nValue triage:\n- Keep (and I have added to output.md): the explicit boundary lemma, the Fourier two-translate lemma, Lemma S (integrality-based singleton rigidity), the meandering classification (Proposition K), and the anti-m-tiling singleton rigidity (Proposition K2). These are clean, broadly applicable, and rigorously proved.\n- Retain in notes (not in output.md): specific numerical Fourier evaluations; the q=3 explicit instance is subsumed by the general Proposition G and can stay as an illustrative example in notes.\n\nNext steps (actionable):\n- Push the classification: When J_0 has exactly 1/q translational symmetry, try to prove the 1/q-offset in \u03b8_m\u2212\u03b8_{m\u22121} must be constant (hence only the q helical tilings occur). A promising route is a three-row argument tracking boundary propagation and using the intersection identity; formalize a contradiction if two distinct offsets occur across consecutive increments.\n- Multi-translate Fourier obstructions: we now have the m=2 lemma. P03 sketched an m=3 obstruction; formalize and record a general \u201cvector of Fourier mode constraints\u201d for m translates. Provide at least one fully worked m=3 example.\n- For K={0,1,2}, systematize simultaneous compatibility for more than two orders (\u2113=4 with K={0,1,2,3}), compute the resulting linear constraints, and combine with the boundary lemma to force non-columnity and multiple periods. Aim for three or more pairwise incommensurable periods.\n- Update Proposition H\u2019s incommensurability clause with Lemma Q: allow arbitrary s by choosing \u03b2 with s/\u03b2\u2209Q.\n",
  "new_notes_md": "Additions and clarifications (Round 0004)\n\n1) Clarification for Lemma C (singleton congruences)\n- The necessity part implicitly uses that the increment \u03b2:=\u03b8_n\u2212\u03b8_{n\u22121} is constant in n. This is guaranteed when 1\u2208K (as in K={0,1} and K={0,1,2} used here), or more generally when the fixed order across rows implies a helical structure. All our applications satisfy 1\u2208K.\n\n2) Complementary two-layer: singleton tools\n- Integrality-based singleton rigidity. For A=({0}\u00d7J_0)\u222a({1}\u00d7J_1) with J_1=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1), the per-row identity is |J_0| d_m + (1\u2212|J_0|) d_{m\u22121}=1 and the intersection identity implies: if d_{m\u22121}\u22651 then d_m\u22641, and symmetrically. If either 1/|J_0|\u2209N or 1/(1\u2212|J_0|)\u2209N then no d_m can be 0 (else we would force one of these reciprocals to be an integer), and the inequality forces d_m\u22641. Thus d_m=1 for all m. This recovers singleton-per-row without the special |J_0|=1/2 case.\n- Anti-m-tiling singleton rigidity (stronger hypothesis). If neither J_0 nor J_1 admits any m-fold partition of S^1 by disjoint translates for any m\u22652, then d_m=1 for all m: if d_{m\u22121}\u22652, then |U_m|<|J_0| so d_m=0, which forces an m-tile by J_1; contradiction. Symmetrically, d_{m\u22121}=0 would force an m-tile by J_0. Hence all d\u2019s are 1.\n- Meandering classification (singleton regime). Assuming d_m=1, the complementary structure forces J_0+\u03b8_m = J_0+(\u03b1+\u03b8_{m\u22121}) a.e., i.e. \u03b8_m\u2212\u03b8_{m\u22121}\u2212\u03b1 \u2208 Stab(J_0). Conversely, any sequence of increments in \u03b1+Stab(J_0) yields a valid singleton tiling. This exhibits many (often aperiodic) singleton tilings; helical ones are obtained by taking a constant offset.\n\n3) Fourier obstructions\n- Two-translate obstruction. If E+\u03b4=S^1\\E a.e., then for any t\u22600 with \\hat{1_E}(t)\u22600 we have e^{2\u03c0 i t \u03b4}=\u22121. In particular, nonvanishing at two even modes (e.g., t=2 and t=4) forbids such \u03b4 since no \u03b4 can satisfy both e^{4\u03c0 i \u03b4}=\u22121 and e^{8\u03c0 i \u03b4}=\u22121 simultaneously.\n- Worked class: if J_0=U\u222a(U+1/2) with U=[0,c) and c\u2209Q, then \\hat{1_{J_0}}(2k)=2\\hat{1_U}(2k) with \\hat{1_U}(2k)=(e^{4\u03c0 i k c}\u22121)/(4\u03c0 i k)\u22600 for all k\u22651, so no two-translate complement exists. This gives an easy certification for many explicit choices of U (including variants of Theorem A when |J_0|\u22601/2).\n- Sketch for m=3 (to be formalized): If \\hat{1_E}(t) and \\hat{1_E}(2t) are nonzero and S^1 is partitioned a.e. by three translates of E, then the sums of first and second powers of e^{2\u03c0 i t \u03b4_j} vanish simultaneously, which is incompatible unless the three are cube roots of unity up to rotation; that in turn contradicts the second equation. This yields a quick \u201cno 3-translate tiling\u201d test.\n\n4) Incommensurability algebra\n- If s/\u03b2\u2209Q then \u03b2/(\u03b2\u2212s)\u2209Q. Thus, in the K={0,1,2} two-order family, one can ensure incommensurability by choosing \u03b2 so that s/\u03b2 is irrational (no need to assume s rational).\n\n5) Symmetry of two-translate complements\n- E+\u03b4=S^1\\E a.e. iff (S^1\\E)+\u03b4=E a.e. Hence \u201cno two-translate tiling\u201d is symmetric under complement and translation. This justifies the symmetric step in the |J_0|=1/2 singleton rigidity proof.\n\n6) Concrete directions\n- Prove that when Stab(J_0)=(1/q)Z with no finer invariance, the offsets \u03b8_m\u2212\u03b8_{m\u22121}\u2212\u03b1 (mod 1/q) must be constant across m; deduce that only the q helical tilings occur in that regime.\n- Formalize the m=3 Fourier obstruction and apply it to explicit J_0 at |J_0|=1/3 to enforce the hypotheses of the anti-m-tiling singleton rigidity.\n- For K={0,1,2,3}, enumerate fixed orders, write the congruence systems, and search for simultaneous compatibilities; combine with boundary integrality to certify non-columnity and extract \u22653 incommensurable periods.\n",
  "new_notes_append": "True",
  "new_outputs_md": "Additions, clarifications, and new tools\n\nRemark (clarification for Lemma C). In the necessity direction we used the identity \u03b8_{m\u2212k_i}\u2212\u03b8_{m\u2212k_{\u03c3(i)}}=(k_{\u03c3(i)}\u2212k_i)\u03b2 with \u03b2:=\u03b8_n\u2212\u03b8_{n\u22121} independent of n. This constancy holds when 1\u2208K (as in our applications K={0,1} and {0,1,2}). For general K one needs a helical-phase conclusion from the fixed-order hypothesis before specializing to a constant \u03b2.\n\nLemma E (Boundary obstruction to finite-column tilings: explicit statement). Let A=\\bigcup_i\\{k_i\\}\u00d7[a_i,b_i] and, for each height k, let the aggregated layer be J_k:=\\bigcup_{i: k_i=k}[a_i,b_i] with measure \u03bc_k:=|J_k|. Suppose A+T=X\u00d7S^1 with X finite, and write d_n:=|T_n|. Then for all m\u2208Z we have the per-row identity\n  \\sum_k \u03bc_k \u00b7 d_{m\u2212k} = 1_{m\u2208X}.\nIf p:=min X and k_min:=min\\{k_i\\}, then only anchors at z=p\u2212k_min can contribute to row p, hence \u03bc_{k_min}\u00b7d_{p\u2212k_min}=1. Similarly, if q:=max X and k_max:=max\\{k_i\\}, then \u03bc_{k_max}\u00b7d_{q\u2212k_max}=1. In particular, if 1/\u03bc_{k_min}\u2209N or 1/\u03bc_{k_max}\u2209N, then no such finite-column tiling exists (A is not a column).\nProof. The per-row identity is the a.e. disjointness of the row-unions. The boundary constraints follow by localization: any anchor z<p\u2212k_min would create coverage below p; any anchor z=p\u2212k with k>k_min creates coverage at row p\u2212(k\u2212k_min)<p. Thus only z=p\u2212k_min contributes to row p, where S^1 is partitioned a.e. by d_{p\u2212k_min} copies of J_{k_min}. The right boundary is analogous. \u220e\n\nLemma T (Fourier two-translate obstruction). Let E\u2282S^1 be measurable. If there exists \u03b4 with E+\u03b4 = S^1\\E a.e., then for every t\u2208Z\\{0} with \\hat{1_E}(t)\u22600 we have e^{2\u03c0 i t \u03b4}=\u22121. In particular, if \\hat{1_E}(2) and \\hat{1_E}(4) are both nonzero, no such \u03b4 can exist.\nProof. Taking Fourier coefficients in 1_{E+\u03b4}+1_E=1 gives e^{2\u03c0 i t \u03b4} \\hat{1_E}(t)+\\hat{1_E}(t)=0 for all t\u22600, hence e^{2\u03c0 i t \u03b4}=\u22121 whenever \\hat{1_E}(t)\u22600. For t=2 and t=4 this would impose \u03b4\u22611/2 (mod 1) and \u03b4\u22611/4 (mod 1) simultaneously, impossible. \u220e\n\nProposition S (Singleton rigidity via integrality exclusion for complementary two-layer tiles). Let A=({0}\u00d7J_0)\u222a({1}\u00d7J_1) with J_1=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1). If either 1/|J_0|\u2209N or 1/|J_1|=1/(1\u2212|J_0|)\u2209N, then every tiling A+T=Z\u00d7S^1 satisfies |T_n|=1 for all n.\nProof. Let d_n:=|T_n| and U_n:=\\bigcup_{\u03b8\u2208T_n}(J_0+\u03b8). The intersection identity yields U_n = \\bigcap_{\u03b8\u2208T_{n\u22121}}(J_0+\u03b1+\u03b8) a.e., hence if d_{n\u22121}\u22651 then |U_n|\u2264|J_0| and therefore d_n\u22641 (since U_n is a disjoint union of d_n copies of J_0). If some d_m=0, then the per-row measure identity |J_0| d_m + (1\u2212|J_0|) d_{m\u22121}=1 forces (1\u2212|J_0|) d_{m\u22121}=1, contradicting 1/(1\u2212|J_0|)\u2209N. Symmetrically, if some d_{m\u22121}=0, then |J_0| d_m=1 contradicts 1/|J_0|\u2209N. Thus no d is 0; since d_{n\u22121}\u22651 we get d_n\u22641 for all n, hence d_n=1. \u220e\n\nProposition K (Meandering classification of singleton tilings for the complementary construction). Let A=({0}\u00d7J_0)\u222a({1}\u00d7J_1) with J_1=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1). Suppose A+T=Z\u00d7S^1 is singleton per row (T_n={\u03b8_n}). Then for every n,\n  J_0+\u03b8_n = J_0+(\u03b1+\u03b8_{n\u22121}) a.e., equivalently \u0394_n:=\u03b8_n\u2212\u03b8_{n\u22121}\u2212\u03b1 \u2208 Stab(J_0):=\\{t\u2208S^1 : J_0+t=J_0 a.e.\\}.\nConversely, for any bi-infinite sequence (\u0394_n) with values in Stab(J_0), the sequence \u03b8_n:=\u03b8_0+\\sum_{j=1}^n(\u03b1+\u0394_j) defines a singleton tiling T={(n,\u03b8_n)}.\nProof. The \u201conly if\u201d follows from U_n=J_0+\u03b8_n=S^1\\V_n and V_n=\\bigcup_{\u03b8\u2208T_{n\u22121}}(J_1+\u03b8)=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1+\u03b8_{n\u22121}). The \u201cif\u201d direction: if \u0394_n\u2208Stab(J_0), then J_0+\u03b8_n=J_0+\u03b1+\u03b8_{n\u22121} a.e., so in row n the two contributions are complementary a.e., giving a tiling with a.e. disjointness across all rows. \u220e\n\nProposition K2 (Singleton rigidity for complementary two-layer tiles under anti-m-tiling hypotheses). Let A=({0}\u00d7J_0)\u222a({1}\u00d7J_1) with J_1=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1). Suppose neither J_0 nor J_1 admits an m-fold partition of S^1 by pairwise a.e. disjoint translates for any integer m\u22652. Then every tiling A+T=Z\u00d7S^1 is singleton per row: |T_n|=1 for all n.\nProof. Let d_n:=|T_n| and U_n:=\\bigcup_{\u03b8\u2208T_n}(J_0+\u03b8), V_n:=\\bigcup_{\u03b8\u2208T_{n\u22121}}(J_1+\u03b8). As before U_n\u2294V_n=S^1 a.e. and U_n=\\bigcap_{\u03b8\u2208T_{n\u22121}}(J_0+\u03b1+\u03b8) a.e. If d_{n\u22121}\u22652, then there exist \u03b8\u2260\u03b8\u2032 in T_{n\u22121} with \u03b8\u2032\u2212\u03b8\u2209Stab(J_1)=Stab(J_0), hence |(J_0+\u03b1+\u03b8)\u2229(J_0+\u03b1+\u03b8\u2032)|<|J_0| and thus |U_n|<|J_0|, forcing d_n=0. Then V_n=S^1 a.e., so S^1 is the a.e. disjoint union of d_{n\u22121} copies of J_1, i.e. an m-translate tiling with m=d_{n\u22121}\u22652, a contradiction. Hence d_{n\u22121}\u22641; by symmetry d_n\u22641. Finally, d_{n\u22121}=0 would force U_n=S^1 and hence an m-translate tiling by J_0 with m=d_n\u22652, again a contradiction. Therefore d_{n\u22121}=d_n=1 for all n. \u220e\n\nLemma Q (Incommensurability via ratio). If s\u2208(0,1) and \u03b2\u2209Q satisfy s/\u03b2\u2209Q, then \u03b2/(\u03b2\u2212s)\u2209Q.\nProof. If \u03b2/(\u03b2\u2212s)=p/q\u2208Q, then (q\u2212p)\u03b2=ps, hence s/\u03b2=(q\u2212p)/p\u2208Q, a contradiction. \u220e\n\nAddendum to Proposition I. The symmetric step \u201cd_n=0 is impossible\u201d uses that J_1 admits a two-translate partition iff J_0 does: E+\u03b4=S^1\\E a.e. iff (S^1\\E)+\u03b4=E a.e. Since J_1 is a translate of S^1\\J_0, the hypothesis for J_0 automatically forbids the corresponding partition for J_1. \u220e\n",
