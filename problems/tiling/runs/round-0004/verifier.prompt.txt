You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md and output.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers
- notes.md (summary so far)
- output.md (rigorously proven results so far)

Guidelines:
- notes.md: should be a readable running log of interesting work. Prefer appending. Replace only if old notes are clearly misleading. Remember -- notes should be self-contained and should make sense even without seeing outputs of past provers. 
- output.md:  Think twice before you add something to this file. Everything here should be rigorous, almost publication-ready. It should contain only fully proven theorems that are clearly an interesting step towards the solution (or the solution itself). The beginning of the file is a clear list of interesting theorems you can prove, together with a discussion about why it is relevant. From the statement of the theorem it has to be clear that this constitutes nontrivial progress towards solution. The rest of the file contains a fully rigorous list of the proofs of the theorems. Keep only proven theorems with clear proofs. If a statement in that file is flawed / unprecise and you cannot fix it on the spot, remove it from output.md and instead add it to notes.md with explanation.
- Be careful with the booleans `new_notes_append` and `new_outputs_append`: default is True (append). Use False only when deliberately rewriting everything.

Tasks:
1) Audit rigor: identify unjustified steps, false statements, missing lemmas; produce minimal counterexamples.
2) Triage value: separate genuine progress from noise.
3) Guide next steps: propose what provers should try next.

[{"prover_id": "01", "progress_md": "Round 0004 \u2014 audit, corrections, and new small results (measurable, checkable)\n\nQuick audit of output.md (what\u2019s solid; small clarifications)\n- Theorem A: Correct construction; two tilings T_\u03b1 and T_{\u03b1+1/2} exist, are singleton, hence irreducible by Lemma B. Non-column proof via the \u201ctwo-translate impossibility\u201d is sound because at the left boundary one forces two a.e. disjoint translates of J_0 to cover S^1. The endpoint issue is already covered by the \u201cRemark on endpoints.\u201d A small presentational note: the parenthetical \u201c(iii) can also be deduced from Corollary F by instead choosing |J_0|\u2209{1/m})\u201d refers to a variant of the theorem (with |J_0| not fixed to 1/2); as written, (iii) is proven via the component-length obstruction.\n- Proposition H: The incommensurability clause correctly assumes s rational. We record below a slightly more flexible sufficient condition (s/\u03b2 \u2209 Q), which can be used to ensure incommensurability for arbitrary s by choosing \u03b2 appropriately.\n- Proposition I: Good fix of an earlier overreach; the additional hypothesis \u201cno two-translate partition of S^1 by J_0\u201d is essential in the |J_0|=1/2 case.\n\nNew small lemmas/propositions (auditable, with short proofs)\n1) Singleton rigidity for complementary two-layer tiles under a mild integrality exclusion.\n- Lemma S. Let A=({0}\u00d7J_0)\u222a({1}\u00d7J_1) with J_1=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1). If either 1/(1\u2212|J_0|)\u2209N or 1/|J_0|\u2209N, then every tiling A+T=Z\u00d7S^1 satisfies |T_n|=1 for all n.\n  Proof. Let d_n:=|T_n|. The per-row measure identity yields |J_0| d_n + (1\u2212|J_0|) d_{n\u22121} = 1 for all n. The intersection identity (recorded in output.md) implies: if d_{n\u22121}\u22651 then d_n\u22641. If 1/(1\u2212|J_0|)\u2209N and some d_m=0, then (1\u2212|J_0|) d_{m\u22121}=1 forces a contradiction; hence d_n\u22651 for all n, thus d_n\u22641 by the previous inequality, so d_n=1. Symmetrically, if 1/|J_0|\u2209N and some d_{m\u22121}=0, then |J_0| d_m=1 contradicts integrality; shifting indices gives d_n\u22651 for all n, hence d_n=1 by the inequality. \u220e\n  Why useful here. This supplies an easy route to singleton-per-row (hence irreducibility) for many complementary tiles without invoking the two-translate obstruction; it also streamlines non-column arguments when combined with Lemma B.\n\n2) Meandering classification of singleton tilings for the complementary construction.\n- Proposition K (classification). Let A=({0}\u00d7J_0)\u222a({1}\u00d7J_1) with J_1=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1). Assume a tiling is singleton-per-row, T_n={\u03b8_n}. Then for every n one has J_0+\u03b8_n = J_0+(\u03b1+\u03b8_{n\u22121}) a.e., i.e. \u03b4_n:=\u03b8_n\u2212\u03b8_{n\u22121}\u2212\u03b1 \u2208 Stab(J_0):={t: J_0+t=J_0 a.e.}. Conversely, for any sequence (\u03b4_n) with values in Stab(J_0), the sequence defined by \u03b8_n:=\u03b8_0+\u2211_{j=1}^n(\u03b1+\u03b4_j) yields a singleton tiling T={ (n,\u03b8_n) }.\n  Proof. The \u201conly if\u201d direction is Corollary J. For the converse, on row n we have J_0+\u03b8_n and J_1+\u03b8_{n\u22121}=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1+\u03b8_{n\u22121}). Since \u03b4_n\u2208Stab(J_0), J_0+\u03b8_n=J_0+\u03b1+\u03b8_{n\u22121}+\u03b4_n=J_0+\u03b1+\u03b8_{n\u22121} a.e., so the two contributions are complementary a.e. Pairwise a.e. disjointness holds because different anchors contribute on disjoint rows or contribute complementary sets on the same row. \u220e\n  Why useful here. This shows there are many (generally aperiodic) irreducible singleton tilings for complementary two-layer tiles; periodic choices correspond to \u03b4_n constant, recovering the families in Theorem A and Proposition G. It corrects a prior (overly rigid) heuristic that increments must be constant.\n\n3) Flexible incommensurability for the K={0,1,2} two-order family.\n- Lemma Q. If s\u2208(0,1) and \u03b2\u2209Q satisfy s/\u03b2\u2209Q, then \u03b2/(\u03b2\u2212s)\u2209Q.\n  Proof. If \u03b2/(\u03b2\u2212s)=p/q\u2208Q, then (q\u2212p)\u03b2=ps, so s/\u03b2=(q\u2212p)/p\u2208Q, contradiction. \u220e\n  Why useful here. Proposition H can achieve incommensurability without assuming s rational by choosing \u03b2 so that s/\u03b2\u2209Q (e.g., \u03b2 irrational and rationally independent from s).\n\n4) Fourier obstruction to two-translate complement (explicit numeric check for Theorem A\u2019s U).\n- Lemma F2 (explicit check). For U=[0,0.2]\u222a[0.3,0.35] and J_0:=U\u222a(U+1/2), one has \\hat{1_{J_0}}(2) and \\hat{1_{J_0}}(4) both nonzero. Indeed, \\hat{1_{J_0}}(t)=(1+e^{-\u03c0 i t})\\hat{1_U}(t), so it suffices to show \\hat{1_U}(2),\\hat{1_U}(4)\u22600. Direct computation yields\n  \\hat{1_U}(2) \u2248 0.01787 \u2212 0.10419 i,  \\hat{1_U}(4) \u2248 \u22120.05229 \u2212 0.07196 i,\n  hence \\hat{1_{J_0}}(2)\u22480.03573\u22120.20838 i and \\hat{1_{J_0}}(4)\u2248\u22120.10458\u22120.14391 i. By the Fourier complement lemma (already recorded in notes), the existence of \u03b4 with J_0+\u03b4=S^1\\J_0 a.e. would force e^{2\u03c0 i t \u03b4}=\u22121 for all t with \\hat{1_{J_0}}(t)\u22600, impossible for t=2 and t=4 simultaneously. Thus J_0 has no two-translate complement, validating Theorem A\u2019s non-column step via Fourier as an alternative to component-lengths.\n  Why useful here. It provides a concrete, fully checkable obstruction for the numeric Theorem A instance.\n\nExamples and quick checks\n- Theorem A instance (as in output.md). The explicit Fourier values above certify the \u201cno two-translate\u201d hypothesis; T_\u03b1 and T_{\u03b1+1/2} are singleton tilings; Lemma B gives irreducibility; incommensurability by Lemma R.\n- K={0,1,2} instance. Take c_1=c_3=2/5, c_2=1/5. Pick \u03b2=\u221a2/10 so that s/\u03b2= (2/5)/(\u221a2/10)=4/\u221a2=2\u221a2\u2209Q; then \u03b2/(\u03b2\u2212s) is irrational by Lemma Q. Non-column holds by Lemma E (1/c_1=5/2\u2209N). Irreducible by Lemma B.\n\nCorrections and obstacles (what failed and how we fixed it)\n- Earlier \u201crigidity\u201d attempt (all increments equal) is false in general: Proposition K shows any sequence of increments in Stab(J_0) works in the singleton regime. Constant increments are just a special (periodic) case.\n- The |J_0|=1/2 rigidity in Proposition I necessarily uses a further obstruction (no two-translate tiling for J_0); Lemma S shows an alternative path to singleton-per-row when either reciprocal measure is not an integer.\n\nWhat to add/adjust in output.md (gaps and suggested insertions)\n- Add Lemma S (singleton rigidity under 1/(1\u2212|J_0|)\u2209N or 1/|J_0|\u2209N). It provides a simple, general route to singleton-per-row for complementary tiles beyond |J_0|=1/2.\n- Add Proposition K (meandering classification) to make explicit that all singleton tilings for the complementary construction are parameterized by sequences in Stab(J_0); note that periodic sequences yield the families in Theorem A and Proposition G.\n- In Proposition H, mention the alternative incommensurability criterion \u201cs/\u03b2\u2209Q\u201d (Lemma Q), allowing s arbitrary by a suitable choice of \u03b2.\n- Optionally include the explicit Fourier check for the Theorem A example (Lemma F2) as an alternative to the component-length argument in (iii).\n\nNext steps (concrete, testable)\n- Formalize a \u201cq-phase meandering classification\u201d: with Stab(J_0)=(1/q)Z, characterize all periods arising from sequences \u03b4_n taking values in (1/q)Z (e.g., constant sequences give periods (1,\u03b1+j/q), periodic \u03b4_n of period r give periods (r, r\u03b1 + sum \u03b4_n), etc.).\n- For K={0,1,2}, explore simultaneous compatibility for more than two orders and derive the associated linear relations among slopes; combine with Lemma E to obtain multi-period families, aiming at three or more pairwise incommensurable periods.\n- Strengthen the Fourier obstruction into a general \u201cno m-translate partition\u201d test for |J_0|=1/m, recording explicit coefficient constraints and supplying at least one fully worked example for m=3.\n"}, {"prover_id": "02", "progress_md": "Round 0004 \u2014 audit, tightenings, and small new results/lemmas\n\nAudit of output.md (gaps and clarifications)\n- Theorem A, item (iii) remark. The proof of non-columnity (for the specific choice |J_0|=1/2) is correct via the component-length obstruction. The parenthetical remark \u201c(iii) can also be deduced from Corollary F by instead choosing |J_0|\u2209{1/m}\u201d changes the construction (different J_0). That is fine as a variant, but strictly it does not prove (iii) for the J_0 fixed in Theorem A. Suggest: move this to a separate \u201cvariant\u201d remark (Theorem A\u2032) where we choose |U|\u22601/4 so that |J_0|=2|U|\u2209{1/m} and appeal directly to Corollary F.\n- Proposition I (\u201csingleton rigidity,\u201d |J_0|=1/2). The step \u201cSimilarly, d_n=0 is impossible\u201d tacitly uses that J_1 cannot admit a two-translate partition of S^1. This follows from the assumption on J_0 because E+\u03b4=S^1\\E iff (S^1\\E)+\u03b4=E. Since J_1=(S^1\\J_0)+\u03b1 is a translate of S^1\\J_0, forbidding J_0 \u2294 (J_0+\u03b4)=S^1 automatically forbids J_1 \u2294 (J_1+\u03b4\u2032)=S^1. Suggest adding this one-line justification explicitly.\n- Lemma E (Boundary obstruction). In output.md it is labeled \u201cAs before.\u201d To avoid cross-referencing, I recommend restating the lemma explicitly: if k_min:=min K and \u03bc_min:=|\u22c3_{i: k_i=k_min}[a_i,b_i]|, then for any finite-column tiling A+T=X\u00d7S^1 with p:=min X we must have d_{p\u2212k_min}\u00b7\u03bc_min=1 (hence 1/\u03bc_min\u2208N); similarly at the right boundary with k_max.\n- Endpoint convention is consistently addressed; OK.\n\nNew results and refinements (small, auditable)\n1) Fourier obstruction to two-translate complements (formal statement and proof)\n- Lemma (Fourier two-copy obstruction). Let E\u2282S^1 be measurable. If there exists \u03b4 with E+\u03b4 = S^1\\E a.e., then for every nonzero t\u2208Z with \\hat{1_E}(t)\u22600 we have e^{2\\pi i t \u03b4} = \u22121. In particular, if \\hat{1_E}(2) and \\hat{1_E}(4) are both nonzero, such a \u03b4 cannot exist.\n  Proof. Taking Fourier coefficients in 1_{E+\u03b4}+1_E=1 yields e^{2\\pi i t \u03b4} \\hat{1_E}(t)+\\hat{1_E}(t)=0 for all t\u22600, hence the first claim. For t=2 and t=4 this would force e^{4\\pi i \u03b4}=\u22121 and e^{8\\pi i \u03b4}=\u22121 simultaneously, which is impossible. \u220e\n- Why useful here. This cleanly certifies the \u201cno two-translate\u201d hypothesis in Proposition I for many explicit J_0. For example, if J_0=U\u222a(U+1/2) with U=[0,c) and c\u2209Q, then \\hat{1_{J_0}}(2)=2\\hat{1_U}(2)=(e^{4\\pi i c}\u22121)/(2\\pi i)\u22600 and similarly \\hat{1_{J_0}}(4)\u22600, hence no \u03b4 with J_0+\u03b4=S^1\\J_0 exists. This provides an alternate, short certification for the concrete tiles used in Theorem A (if we take U with irrational length).\n\n2) Boundary obstruction (general K, explicit statement)\n- Lemma (Boundary integrality, general form). Let A=\\bigcup_i\\{k_i\\}\u00d7[a_i,b_i], and for each height k define the aggregated layer J_k:=\u22c3_{i: k_i=k}[a_i,b_i] with \u03bc_k:=|J_k|. Suppose A+T=X\u00d7S^1 with X finite and let d_n:=|T_n|. If p:=min X and k_min:=min\\{k_i\\}, then only anchors z=p\u2212k_min can contribute to row p, hence d_{p\u2212k_min}\u00b7\u03bc_{k_min}=1. Symmetrically, with q:=max X and k_max:=max\\{k_i\\}, we have d_{q\u2212k_max}\u00b7\u03bc_{k_max}=1. In particular, if 1/\u03bc_{k_min}\u2209N or 1/\u03bc_{k_max}\u2209N, A is not a column.\n  Proof. Standard localization at the boundary: any anchor z<p\u2212k_min would create coverage below p; any anchor z=p\u2212k with k>k_min would create coverage at row p\u2212(k\u2212k_min)<p. Thus row p is covered solely by d_{p\u2212k_min} disjoint translates of J_{k_min}, forcing the identity. The right boundary is analogous. \u220e\n- This subsumes Lemma E and makes the obstruction reusable for arbitrary K (not only {0,1,2}).\n\n3) Classification in the complementary two-layer setting (|J_0|=1/2)\n- Proposition (Increment parameterization under singleton and complementarity). Let A=({0}\u00d7J_0)\u222a({1}\u00d7J_1) with J_1=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1) and |J_0|=|J_1|=1/2. Assume J_0 admits no two-translate tiling. Then every tiling A+T=Z\u00d7S^1 is singleton per row (Proposition I), and is determined by a sequence (\u03b8_m)_{m\u2208Z} with the recursion\n  \u03b8_{m}\u2212\u03b8_{m\u22121} \u2208 \u03b1 + Stab(J_0)  for all m,\n  where Stab(J_0):=\\{t\u2208S^1: J_0+t=J_0 a.e.\\}. Conversely, any bi-infinite sequence (\u03b8_m) obeying this recursion defines a tiling. In particular, if J_0 has exactly 1/2-periodicity (Stab(J_0)={0,1/2}+Z), the allowable increments are \u03b1 or \u03b1+1/2 independently at each step m.\n  Proof. Proposition I gives |T_m|\u22611. Row m\u2019s identity U_m=J_0+\u03b8_m=S^1\\V_m and V_m=J_1+\u03b8_{m\u22121}=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1+\u03b8_{m\u22121}) forces J_0+\u03b8_m=J_0+\u03b1+\u03b8_{m\u22121} a.e., hence the increment constraint. Conversely, given any sequence satisfying the constraint, the two sets J_0+\u03b8_m and J_1+\u03b8_{m\u22121} are complementary in row m, providing a tiling with a.e. disjointness. \u220e\n- Why this matters. It shows Theorem A\u2019s complementary construction has a large family of (irreducible) tilings, encompassing the helical tilings T_\u03b1 and T_{\u03b1+1/2} as the constant-increment choices. This also clarifies that demanding a specific period further fixes the increment to be constant.\n\n4) Worked explicit choices ensuring \u201cno two-translate\u201d via Fourier\n- Example. Take U=[0,c) with c=\\sqrt{2}/10. Then J_0:=U\u222a(U+1/2) has \\hat{1_{J_0}}(2)=2\\hat{1_U}(2)=(e^{4\\pi i c}\u22121)/(2\\pi i)\u22600 and \\hat{1_{J_0}}(4)=2\\hat{1_U}(4)=(e^{8\\pi i c}\u22121)/(4\\pi i)\u22600 (since 2c,4c\u2209Z). By the Fourier lemma, J_0 admits no \u03b4 with J_0+\u03b4=S^1\\J_0. Thus Proposition I applies. Picking any irrational \u03b1 then produces two irreducible tilings with periods (1,\u03b1) and (1,\u03b1+1/2), incommensurable by Lemma R.\n\nSmall corrections/caveats to record\n- Proposition H (K={0,1,2} two-order family): the incommensurability clause correctly keeps s rational. Removing that hypothesis can fail (counterexample: \u03b2=\\sqrt{2}, s=\u03b2/2 gives \u03b2/(\u03b2\u2212s)=2\u2208Q).\n- As noted above, J_1 has a two-translate tiling iff J_0 does (since J_1=(S^1\\J_0)+\u03b1). This justifies the symmetry step in Proposition I\u2019s proof.\n\nWhy these additions advance the program\n- They provide a compact, verifiable obstruction (Fourier) to the only delicate step in the |J_0|=1/2 regime (ruling out 2-fold partitions), applicable to many explicit U. This simplifies checking Theorem A (iii) concretely.\n- The general boundary lemma is a reusable tool beyond K={0,1,2}, and makes non-column checks almost mechanical for many tiles.\n- The increment-parameterization proposition clarifies the full family of tilings for the complementary construction (in the singleton regime), isolating the exact freedom and showing how the helical tilings sit inside it. This aligns with Corollary J and avoids overclaiming uniqueness.\n\nIdeas to pursue next (auditable targets)\n- Record the Fourier lemma as a formal tool in output.md and apply it to a few concrete U (single-interval U with irrational length, or two-interval U with simple rational endpoints), computing \\hat{1_{J_0}}(2), \\hat{1_{J_0}}(4) explicitly to certify non-columnity in Theorem A.\n- State and prove the boundary integrality lemma (general K) explicitly in output.md and reference it in Proposition H, replacing \u201cAs before.\u201d\n- Multi-order extensions beyond K={0,1,2}: using Lemma C, list all \u03c3 for \u2113=4 with K={0,1,2,3} and compute the resulting linear constraints; look for simultaneous compatibilities yielding \u22653 distinct slopes, and then apply the boundary lemma to certify non-columnity (e.g., force 1/\u03bc_{k_min}\u2209N).\n- Quantify incommensurability in the q-phase family: for any irrational \u03b1 and 0\u2264j<j\u2032<q, (\u03b1+j/q)/(\u03b1+j\u2032/q)\u2209Q by Lemma R; record this explicitly with a short proof in output.md (currently indicated parenthetically under Proposition G).\n\nPotential pitfalls and how we avoid them\n- Overclaiming singleton rigidity for general |J_0|. We restrict singleton rigidity to |J_0|=1/2 with a \u201cno 2-translate\u201d hypothesis (Proposition I). For general |J_0|, the boundary equation can allow patterns like (d_m,d_{m\u22121})=(1/|J_0|,0); forbidding these requires forbidding m-translate tilings for m=1/|J_0| (Fourier can help), but we do not claim this generally here.\n- Endpoint issues are kept as a standing a.e. convention; all Fourier arguments rely on L^2-coefficients and are stable under null boundary changes.\n\nConcrete checklist for the verifier\n- For the U=[0,\\sqrt{2}/10) example, compute \\hat{1_{J_0}}(2), \\hat{1_{J_0}}(4) explicitly from the single-interval formula and verify they are nonzero; conclude \u201cno two-translate.\u201d\n- Insert the explicit statement/proof of the boundary integrality lemma into output.md; confirm Proposition H cites it correctly.\n- Add the one-line symmetry justification in Proposition I about J_1 and J_0 two-translate equivalence.\n- Optionally, include the increment-parameterization proposition (with its short proof) to make Corollary J\u2019s content explicit as a classification statement in the |J_0|=1/2 complementary case.\n"}, {"prover_id": "03", "progress_md": "Round 0004 \u2014 audit, strengthened rigidity, and Fourier obstructions\n\nAudit of output.md (small gaps and clarifications)\n- Lemma C (fixed-order singleton congruences). The proof (both directions) implicitly uses that \u03b8_n\u2212\u03b8_{n\u22121} is constant in n (so that \u03b8_{m\u2212k_i}\u2212\u03b8_{m\u2212k_{\u03c3(i)}}=(k_{\u03c3(i)}\u2212k_i)\u03b2). This is guaranteed when 1\u2208K (or more generally when H:=\u27e8K\u2212K\u27e9=Z and one anchors the order consistently to deduce helical behavior). Suggest explicitly adding the hypothesis \u201c1\u2208K\u201d (as in our applications K={0,1} and {0,1,2}) or appending a brief pre-lemma: fixed cyclic order across rows implies helical phases when H=Z.\n- Measure identity at a row. The Additional tools section correctly uses the aggregated layer measures \u03bc_k:=|J_k| to write \u2211_k \u03bc_k d_{m\u2212k} = 1, which is robust even if, within a height k, multiple arcs in A overlap. The \u201cBasic facts\u201d line in notes.md stating \u2211_i |T_{m\u2212k_i}|(b_i\u2212a_i)=1 tacitly assumes within-height disjointness; I recommend consistently using the aggregated form (as in output.md) throughout to avoid ambiguity.\n\nNew results (incremental, auditable)\n1) General singleton rigidity for complementary two-layer tiles under a mild anti-m-tiling hypothesis\n- Proposition K (singleton rigidity beyond |J_0|=1/2). Let A=({0}\u00d7J_0)\u222a({1}\u00d7J_1) with J_1:=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1). Suppose both J_0 and J_1 fail to admit any m-fold translational tiling of S^1 by pairwise a.e. disjoint translates, for every m\u22652. Then any tiling A+T=Z\u00d7S^1 satisfies |T_n|=1 for all n.\n  Proof. For row m, set d_m:=|T_m|, U_m:=\u22c3_{\u03b8\u2208T_m} (J_0+\u03b8) and V_m:=\u22c3_{\u03b8\u2208T_{m\u22121}} (J_1+\u03b8). As before, U_m\u2294V_m=S^1 a.e. and also U_m=\u22c2_{\u03b8\u2208T_{m\u22121}} (J_0+\u03b1+\u03b8) a.e. If d_{m\u22121}\u22652 then T_{m\u22121} contains \u03b8\u2260\u03b8\u2032 with \u03b8\u2032\u2212\u03b8\u2209Stab(J_1)=Stab(J_0) (else the two copies of J_1 would coincide a.e., violating a.e. disjointness). Hence the intersection of J_0+\u03b1+\u03b8 and J_0+\u03b1+\u03b8\u2032 has measure strictly less than |J_0|, so |U_m|<|J_0| and therefore d_m\u00b7|J_0|=|U_m|<|J_0|, forcing d_m=0. But then V_m=S^1, so S^1 is the a.e. disjoint union of d_{m\u22121} copies of J_1; thus d_{m\u22121}=1/|J_1|\u2208N and J_1 m-tiles S^1\u2014a contradiction. Therefore d_{m\u22121}\u22641. By symmetry, d_m\u22641 for all m. Finally, d_{m\u22121}=0 is impossible: it would force U_m=S^1 and thus d_m=1/|J_0|\u2208N and an m-fold tiling by translates of J_0, again contradicting the hypothesis. Hence d_{m\u22121}=d_m=1 for all m. \u220e\n  Why useful here. This strictly generalizes Proposition I: it yields |T_n|=1 for every complementary two-layer tile as soon as we forbid any multi-translate partition for J_0 and J_1 (e.g., by choosing |J_0|,|J_1|\u2209{1/m} or via Fourier/component-length obstructions when |J_\u2022|=1/m). It streamlines irreducibility (Lemma B) and supports classification attempts.\n  Corollary K1 (quick criterion). If |J_0|\u2209{1/m} and |J_1|=1\u2212|J_0|\u2209{1/m}, then every tiling by A is singleton-per-row. Combining with Corollary F (non-column when |J_0|\u2209{1/m}) gives a very robust family: non-column, all tilings singleton, and (with J_0+1/q=J_0) q distinct helical periods as in Proposition G.\n\n2) Fourier obstructions to multi-translate partitions (extensions)\n- Lemma (two-translate obstruction, recorded precisely). If E\u2282S^1 and E+\u03b4=S^1\\E a.e., then for all t\u2208Z\\{0} with \\hat{1_E}(t)\u22600 we have e^{2\u03c0 i t \u03b4}=\u22121. In particular, if \\hat{1_E}(t_1) and \\hat{1_E}(t_2) are nonzero for two distinct t\u2019s such that there is no \u03b4 with e^{2\u03c0 i t_1 \u03b4}=e^{2\u03c0 i t_2 \u03b4}=\u22121, then no such \u03b4 exists. This is exactly the tool used implicitly in Theorem A; keeping it explicit helps certify the \u201cno two-translate\u201d hypothesis when |J_0|=1/2.\n- Lemma (three-translate obstruction). Suppose E\u2282S^1 and there exist t with \\hat{1_E}(t)\u22600 and \\hat{1_E}(2t)\u22600. If S^1 is a.e. the disjoint union of three translates E+\u03b4_1, E+\u03b4_2, E+\u03b4_3, then e^{2\u03c0 i t \u03b4_1}+e^{2\u03c0 i t \u03b4_2}+e^{2\u03c0 i t \u03b4_3}=0 and also e^{2\u03c0 i 2t \u03b4_1}+e^{2\u03c0 i 2t \u03b4_2}+e^{2\u03c0 i 2t \u03b4_3}=0. But the second equation reads (e^{2\u03c0 i t \u03b4_1})^2+(e^{2\u03c0 i t \u03b4_2})^2+(e^{2\u03c0 i t \u03b4_3})^2=0, which is incompatible with the first unless the e^{2\u03c0 i t \u03b4_j} are precisely the three cube roots of unity up to a common rotation. In that case the second sum equals 3e^{4\u03c0 i t c}\u22600, contradiction. Hence no 3-translate tiling exists. This gives a quick certificate to forbid 3-fold partitions for concrete E (check two Fourier modes).\n  Why useful here. These Fourier tests let us enforce the hypotheses of Proposition K and Proposition I in concrete examples, especially in the delicate |J_0|=1/m cases where the boundary integrality does not itself obstruct columns.\n\n3) Concrete q=3 example (non-column, three incommensurable periods, all tilings singleton)\n- Pick t:=\u221a2/30 and set U:=[0,t)\u2282[0,1/3). Let J_0:=U\u222a(U+1/3)\u222a(U+2/3). Then |J_0|=3t is irrational and J_0+1/3=J_0. Fix irrational \u03b1 (e.g., \u03b1=\u221a3/10 mod 1) and define J_1:=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1). By Corollary F A:=({0}\u00d7J_0)\u222a({1}\u00d7J_1) is not a column (since |J_0|\u2209{1/m}). By Proposition K every tiling is singleton-per-row. By Proposition G there are three tilings with periods (1,\u03b1+j/3) for j=0,1,2, pairwise incommensurable (Lemma R). This furnishes a clean, fully explicit \u201cmany periods\u201d family.\n\n4) Small elaboration: boundary obstruction for K={0,1,2}, one interval per height\n- Lemma E currently deduces that in any finite-column tiling one must have 1/c_1,1/c_3\u2208N. One can also note the two-sided variant: at the left boundary p we obtain c_1 d_p=1, and at the right boundary q we obtain c_3 d_{q\u22122}=1 with d_p,d_{q\u22122}\u2208N. If c_1 and c_3 are rationally independent (over Q), this yields an immediate contradiction, so A is not a column. This gives another simple non-column certificate for the K={0,1,2} family beyond the condition c_1\u2209{1/m}.\n\nExamples and checks (how to audit)\n- Proposition K sanity check on Theorem A\u2019s tiles. For U as in Theorem A but with |U| chosen so that |J_0|\u2209{1/m}, both J_0 and J_1 have irrational measure and cannot m-tile S^1 for any integer m. Therefore every tiling must be singleton by Proposition K, recovering Proposition I\u2019s conclusion without requiring the special |J_0|=1/2 case.\n- Fourier certificates. For J_0=U\u222a(U+1/2) with U=[0,.2]\u222a[.3,.35], direct interval-Fourier computation shows \\hat{1_{J_0}}(2), \\hat{1_{J_0}}(4)\u22600; hence no \u03b4 with J_0+\u03b4 = S^1\\J_0 exists (two-translate obstruction), validating the \u201cno two-translate\u201d hypothesis in Proposition I.\n\nObstacles and why some routes fail\n- Attempted global classification for complementary two-layer tiles. Corollary J shows \u03b8_m\u2212\u03b8_{m\u22121}\u2208\u03b1+Stab(J_0) for all m. For J_0 with exactly 1/q-periodicity, this pins \u03b8_m\u2212\u03b8_{m\u22121} to \u03b1+(1/q)Z but does not by itself force constancy of the 1/q-offset across m. A direct disjointness argument between neighboring anchors does not exclude variations because J_1+\u03b8_m and J_0+\u03b8_{m+1} are complementary regardless of the 1/q-offset. Proving constancy seems to require an additional nondegeneracy (e.g., constraining boundary propagation) or a more delicate combinatorial argument across multiple rows.\n\nNext steps (concrete, testable)\n- Insert Proposition K into output.md: it unifies and extends the singleton rigidity statements (beyond |J_0|=1/2) under a clear, checkable hypothesis (no m-fold partitions for J_0 and J_1). Include its short proof.\n- Add the m=3 Fourier obstruction lemma (above) to the tools list, next to the two-translate version. This will cover more corner cases where |J_0| or |J_1| happens to be 1/3.\n- Clarify Lemma C\u2019s hypothesis: add \u201cassume 1\u2208K\u201d (as used throughout), or precede it with a short lemma that fixed order implies helical phases when H=Z.\n- Classification target. Under J_0 with minimal translational invariance (1/q) and with the anti-m-tiling hypothesis (so d_n\u22611), attempt to show the 1/q-offset is constant by tracking boundary points across three consecutive rows and exploiting the fact that two distinct offsets would yield an overlap at a shared row. I will try to formalize this three-row argument next.\n"}]

Set-up and notation
- Work in G = Z × S^1 (S^1 = R/Z). A tile A is a finite union of layers of the form {k_i}×[a_i,b_i] with 0 < b_i−a_i < 1, i=1,…,ℓ. A tiling T ⊂ Z×S^1 is a set of translations such that the (almost everywhere) disjoint union of A+(n,θ) over (n,θ)∈T equals Z×S^1. The fiber at n is T_n := {θ ∈ S^1 : (n,θ) ∈ T}. A period (k,α) means T+(k,α)=T.

Basic facts
- Fiber finiteness. In any tiling, every T_n is finite, and for each m we have ∑_i |T_{m−k_i}|·(b_i−a_i) = 1.
- Period transport. If (k,α) is a period then T_{n+k} = T_n + α for all n.

Singleton-per-row tilings
- Definition: |T_n|=1 for all n. Write T_n={θ_n}. Then column m is the (a.e.) disjoint union of the ℓ intervals [a_i+θ_{m−k_i}, b_i+θ_{m−k_i}], i=1,…,ℓ.
- Fixed cyclic order formulation. If, at each m, the ℓ intervals appear in the same cyclic order σ and meet end-to-end, then for some row phase φ_m one has θ_{m−k_i} = φ_m + c_i − a_i, where c_i are order-dependent constants with c_{σ(i)} ≡ c_i + (b_i−a_i) (mod 1). Consequently θ_{m−k_i} − θ_{m−k_j} is independent of m. If 1∈{k_i}, then θ_n−θ_{n−1} is constant, i.e. T has period (1,β) with β := θ_n−θ_{n−1}.
- Linear congruence system (Prover 03). Under a fixed order σ,
  (k_i − k_{σ(i)}) β ≡ a_i + (b_i−a_i) − a_{σ(i)}  (mod 1),  i=1,…,ℓ.
  For ℓ=3, K={0,1,2}, and orders σ=(1→2→3→1), σ'=(1→3→2→1), the two orders are simultaneously compatible for the same endpoints a_i iff c_1=c_3, and then the slopes satisfy β' ≡ β − c_1 (mod 1). This yields two distinct singleton tilings for the same tile when c_1=c_3.
- Irreducibility (singleton, gcd=1). Let H:=⟨K−K⟩≤Z. If H≠Z then any tiling splits along residue classes mod H; hence irreducibility forces H=Z. Moreover, if |T_n|=1 and H=Z then any partition T=T_1⊔T_2 induces Z=X_1⊔X_2 with X_1 closed under subtraction by each k_i and hence under ±(K−K); since H=Z, X_1 is either ∅ or Z. Thus singleton tilings with gcd(K−K)=1 are irreducible.

Two complementary-layer construction (explicit)
- Choose U⊂S^1 a finite union of disjoint intervals with |U|=1/4 and U∩(U+1/2)=∅ (e.g., U=[0,0.2)∪[0.3,0.35)). Let J_0:=U∪(U+1/2). Then |J_0|=1/2 and J_0+1/2=J_0. Pick an irrational α∈(0,1/2), and set J_1:=S^1\(J_0+α). Define A:=({0}×J_0)∪({1}×J_1).
- Two tilings. For any θ_0, define T_α={ (n, θ_0+nα): n∈Z }. On row n the contributions are (J_0+θ_n) and (J_1+θ_{n−1}) with θ_n=θ_0+nα, which are complementary because J_1=S^1\(J_0+α). Thus A+T_α=Z×S^1 a.e., and T_α has period (1,α). Using J_0+1/2=J_0 the same argument works for α' := α+1/2, giving a tiling T_{α'} with period (1,α'). Both are singleton tilings, hence irreducible by the lemma above (K={0,1} has gcd 1).
- Incommensurability. If α∉Q, then α/(α+1/2)∉Q: from α/(α+1/2)=p/q one deduces α=p/(2(q−p))∈Q, a contradiction.
- Non-column property (finite-column tilings impossible). Say A+T=X×S^1 with X finite. Let d_n:=|T_n|. On row n the union is a.e. disjoint, so |J_0| d_n + |J_1| d_{n−1} = 1_{n∈X}. With |J_0|=|J_1|=1/2 this yields d_n + d_{n−1} = 2·1_{n∈X}. Because X is finite, d_n=0 for all n sufficiently large/small. At the left boundary p of any connected component of X, we get d_{p−1}=0 and hence d_p=2; so row p is tiled by two disjoint translates of J_0 alone. Therefore S^1 is a.e. the disjoint union of two translates of J_0, which forces J_0+δ = S^1\J_0 for some δ. Our choice of U ensures this is impossible (the multiset of lengths of connected components of J_0 differs from that of its complement). Hence no such finite X exists: A is not a column.

Consequences
- This explicit A is a non-column tile that admits two irreducible periodic tilings with incommensurable vertical periods (1,α) and (1,α+1/2).
- Independently, for ℓ=3 and K={0,1,2} with c_1=c_3, the congruence mechanism produces two distinct singleton tilings of the same tile with slopes β and β'≡β−c_1. Picking β irrational makes β/(β') irrational unless a rational relation holds; such relations are at most countable in the parameter.

Next directions
- q-periodic generalization: If J_0 has 1/q-periodicity, the same complementary construction yields q tilings with slopes α+j/q; non-column persists under the same “no translational complement” obstruction.
- Non-column for K={0,1,2} singleton tiles: adapt the boundary-recurrence method with |J_•| = c_• to force a boundary row covered by a single layer, then forbid that layer from tiling S^1 by finitely many translates via a connected-component-length invariant.
Additional tools and extensions

1) Boundary obstruction to finite-column tilings (general form). For a tile A, define for each height k the aggregated layer J_k⊂S^1 as the union of all arcs at that height, and μ_k:=|J_k|. In any finite-column tiling A+T=X×S^1 with X finite and d_n:=|T_n|, the per-row measure identity is
  ∑_k μ_k · d_{m−k} = 1_{m∈X}, for all m∈Z.
If p:=min X and k_min:=min K, then only anchors with z=p−k_min can appear (any other anchor would create coverage outside X below p). Therefore d_{p−k_min} μ_{k_min}=1, so 1/μ_{k_min}∈N. Symmetrically, with q:=max X and k_max:=max K we get d_{q−k_max} μ_{k_max}=1, hence 1/μ_{k_max}∈N.

Consequences:
- K={0,1}: μ_{0}=|J_0|, μ_{1}=|J_1|. If |J_0|∉{1/m} then A is not a column. (This yields a very quick non-column test for two-layer tiles, including the complementary construction.)
- K={0,1,2}: If c_i denotes the total measure at height i (e.g., one interval per layer), then necessarily 1/c_1 and 1/c_3 are integers in any finite-column tiling. In particular, if c_1 or c_3 is not a reciprocal of an integer, the tile is not a column.

2) q-phase generalization of the complementary 2-layer construction. If J_0⊂S^1 is 1/q-periodic (J_0+1/q=J_0) and J_1:=S^1\(J_0+α) with α irrational, then for each j=0,1,…,q−1 the singleton set T_{α+j/q}:={(n,θ_0+n(α+j/q))} is a tiling with period (1,α+j/q). For j≠j′, the ratio (α+j/q)/(α+j′/q) cannot be rational (else α would be rational). If additionally |J_0|∉{1/m}, the boundary obstruction implies A is not a column. Irreducibility follows from the singleton-gcd criterion (K={0,1}).

3) Two-order singleton family for K={0,1,2} completed. When c_1=c_3=s, Lemma C shows the two cyclic orders (1→2→3→1) and (1→3→2→1) are simultaneously compatible and the slopes satisfy β′≡β−s (mod 1). If s∉{1/m}, the boundary obstruction rules out columns. If s is rational and β is irrational, then β/(β′) cannot be rational (else β would be rational), so the two periods are incommensurable.

4) Fourier alternative to translational complement. If E⊂S^1 satisfies E+δ = S^1\E a.e., then for all t≠0 with \hat{1_E}(t)≠0 we have e^{2π i t δ}=−1. In particular, if two distinct t’s have nonzero coefficients and cannot share a δ with e^{2π i t δ}=−1 simultaneously, such a δ cannot exist. This certifies non-columnity in cases like |J_0|=1/m when the boundary obstruction alone does not suffice.

Remark on endpoints. Complements produce open arcs; choosing closed representatives changes sets only on measure-zero boundaries and does not affect any of our tiling or measure identities.
Updates, corrections, and new tools

1) On the “complementary two-layer” structure A=({0}×J_0)∪({1}×J_1) with J_1=S^1\(J_0+α)
- Intersection identity. For any tiling A+T and row m, writing U_m:=⋃_{θ∈T_m}(J_0+θ) and V_m:=⋃_{θ∈T_{m−1}}(J_1+θ), we have U_m⊔V_m=S^1 a.e. and
  V_m = ⋃_{θ∈T_{m−1}} (S^1\(J_0+α+θ)) = S^1 \ ⋂_{θ∈T_{m−1}} (J_0+α+θ).
  Hence U_m = ⋂_{θ∈T_{m−1}} (J_0+α+θ) a.e. In particular, if d_{m−1}:=|T_{m−1}|≥1 then |U_m|≤|J_0|, which implies d_m≤1 (since U_m is a disjoint union of d_m translates of J_0). A symmetric statement holds one step forward: if d_m≥1 then d_{m+1}≤1.
- Degeneracy (0/2) is not excluded without extra hypotheses. For |J_0|=|J_1|=1/2, the per-row identity is d_m+d_{m−1}=2. The pattern (…,2,0,2,0,…) is compatible with this identity; ruling it out requires forbidding two-translate tilings of J_0 (and hence of J_1). Our Theorem A already enforces this (via component-length mismatch). Under this “no two-translate” hypothesis we can prove d_m=1 for all m (see new Proposition I in output.md).

2) Irreducibility and gcd(K−K)
- Necessity. If H:=⟨K−K⟩≠Z (say gcd g>1), any tiling splits along residue classes modulo g: for T^{(r)}:={ (z,θ)∈T : z≡r (mod g) } one has A+T^{(r)} = X_r×S^1 a.e. where X_r:=gZ+r, and the union over r is disjoint. Thus H=Z is necessary for irreducibility, not only in the singleton regime.
- Sufficiency in the singleton case. We include the full closure argument: if T=T_1⊔T_2 yields A+T_i=X_i×S^1, then from m∈X_1 all m−k_i∈X_1, hence X_1 is a union of cosets of H. If H=Z, X_1 is ∅ or Z.

3) Singleton with fixed cyclic order: equivalence (Lemma C)
- We now record the sufficiency half: if β and the a_i satisfy (k_i−k_{σ(i)})β≡a_i+c_i−a_{σ(i)} (mod 1), then θ_n:=θ_0+nβ produces, at each row m, ℓ arcs that meet end-to-end in the σ-order and (since ∑c_i=1) a.e. partition S^1.

4) Incommensurability tools
- General rational-shift test. If α∉Q and a≠b∈Q, then (α+a)/(α+b)∉Q. In particular, if α∉Q and r∈Q\{0}, then α/(α+r)∉Q. This packages the algebra used repeatedly in Theorem A and Prop. G.
- Caution (Prop. H). The statement “β/(β−s)∉Q for all s∈(0,1)” is false without assuming s∈Q; e.g., β=√2 and s=β/2 give β/(β−s)=2∈Q. We retain the hypothesis s rational in the incommensurability clause of Prop. H.

5) Fourier two-copy obstruction (record)
- If E+δ=S^1\E a.e., then for every t≠0 with \hat{1_E}(t)≠0 we have e^{2πitδ}=−1. This is useful to forbid two-translate tilings when |E|=1/2 (or more generally |E|=1/m), and underpins the “no two-translate” hypothesis.

6) Next targets (rigidity and classification)
- Under J_0 with only 1/q-translational invariance, prove that any complementary two-layer tiling must have constant increment θ_m−θ_{m−1} modulo 1/q; hence classify all tilings as the q helical ones from Prop. G. Strategy: use the intersection identity row-to-row and endpoint propagation to show that varying the 1/q offset produces overlaps.
- Systematically extend the multi-order mechanism beyond K={0,1,2}, again leveraging Lemma C and boundary obstruction Lemma E.


Current output.md (if any):
Summary of proven results and why they matter
- Main existence theorem (Theorem A). We construct an explicit tile A⊂Z×S^1 that is not a column yet admits two irreducible tilings with periods (1,α) and (1,α+1/2), with α irrational; these two periods are incommensurable. This positively settles the core existence question.
- General structure for singleton tilings. We record a concise congruence system that characterizes singleton-per-row tilings with a fixed cyclic order, now with both necessity and sufficiency, and an irreducibility criterion. We also prove that gcd(K−K)=1 is not only sufficient (in the singleton setting) but that gcd(K−K)>1 forces reducibility in general.
- Complementary two-layer family: q-phase generalization. If J_0 has 1/q-periodicity, the complementary construction yields q singleton tilings with incommensurable vertical periods (1,α+j/q). A quick boundary test certifies non-columnity whenever |J_0|∉{1/m}.
- Two-order mechanism for K={0,1,2} completed. When c_1=c_3, a single tile admits two distinct singleton tilings corresponding to the cyclic orders (1→2→3→1) and (1→3→2→1); the slopes differ by c_1 modulo 1. Non-columnity follows from the boundary obstruction when c_1∉{1/m}. If c_1 is rational and the slope is irrational, the two periods are incommensurable.
- Rigidity for Theorem A-type tiles. For the complementary two-layer tiles with |J_0|=1/2 that do not admit a two-translate partition of S^1, every tiling is automatically singleton-per-row. This streamlines irreducibility and supports further classification.

Theorem A (Non-column tile with two incommensurable periods). Fix an irrational α∈(0,1/2). Let U⊂S^1 be a finite union of disjoint intervals of total length 1/4 such that U∩(U+1/2)=∅ and the multiset of lengths of connected components of U is different from that of its complement in [0,1/2). Define J_0:=U∪(U+1/2) (so |J_0|=1/2 and J_0+1/2=J_0), J_1:=S^1\(J_0+α), and set A:=( {0}×J_0 ) ∪ ( {1}×J_1 ). Then:
(i) There is a tiling T_α with period (1,α), and a tiling T_{α+1/2} with period (1,α+1/2).
(ii) Both tilings are irreducible.
(iii) A is not a column (i.e., there is no finite X⊂Z and T⊂Z×S^1 with A+T=X×S^1).
(iv) The periods are incommensurable: α/(α+1/2)∉Q.
Proof. (i)–(iv) As in the previous version; we only note that (iii) can also be deduced from Corollary F by instead choosing |J_0|∉{1/m}, in which case the boundary obstruction immediately rules out finite-column tilings. ∎

Lemma B (Irreducibility for singleton tilings with gcd(K−K)=1). Let A have layers at K={k_1,…,k_ℓ} and suppose |T_n|=1 for all n (singleton). Let H:=⟨K−K⟩≤Z. If H=Z then any tiling is irreducible.
Proof. Assume a decomposition T=T_1⊔T_2 such that A+T_i=X_i×S^1 with Z=X_1⊔X_2 disjoint. Fix m∈X_1. In row m the contributing anchors are exactly at indices m−k_i (one per i). If for some i we had m−k_i∉X_1, then the corresponding interval [a_i+θ_{m−k_i},b_i+θ_{m−k_i}] would belong to A+T_2 and yet lie inside row m∈X_1, contradicting A+T_1=X_1×S^1. Hence m−k_i∈X_1 for all i, so X_1 is closed under subtraction by each k_i, hence under ±(K−K). Therefore X_1 is a union of cosets of H. If H=Z, only ∅ and Z occur, proving irreducibility. ∎

Lemma B′ (Reducibility when gcd(K−K)>1). Let H:=⟨K−K⟩ and suppose H≠Z, with index g:=[Z:H]>1. For r=0,1,…,g−1 let T^{(r)}:={ (z,θ)∈T : z≡r (mod g) } and X_r:=gZ+r. Then A+T^{(r)}=X_r×S^1 a.e., and thus A+T is reducible into g disjoint tilings along residue classes mod g.
Proof. A translate anchored at z contributes only to rows z+k_i, each ≡z (mod g). Hence only anchors with z≡r can contribute to rows in X_r, and conversely all coverage of a row m∈X_r comes from T^{(r)}. Disjointness across distinct r is automatic since they occupy disjoint rows. ∎

Lemma C (Singleton congruences under a fixed cyclic order: necessity and sufficiency). Assume |T_n|=1 and that on every row the ℓ intervals appear in the same cyclic order σ and meet end-to-end. Let c_i:=b_i−a_i and β:=θ_n−θ_{n−1} (mod 1). Then the adjacency constraints are equivalent to the congruence system
  (k_i − k_{σ(i)}) β ≡ a_i + c_i − a_{σ(i)}  (mod 1),  i=1,…,ℓ.
Proof. Necessity: matching the right endpoint of i with the left endpoint of σ(i) and using θ_{m−k_i}−θ_{m−k_{σ(i)}}=(k_{σ(i)}−k_i)β gives the displayed congruences. Sufficiency: Given β solving these congruences, define θ_n:=θ_0+nβ. At row m put intervals I_i:=[a_i+θ_{m−k_i}, a_i+θ_{m−k_i}+c_i]. The congruences read a_i+θ_{m−k_i}+c_i ≡ a_{σ(i)}+θ_{m−k_{σ(i)}}, so the right endpoint of I_i equals the left endpoint of I_{σ(i)}. Summing lengths gives ∑_i|I_i|=∑_ic_i=1. Thus the I_i meet end-to-end around the circle in the σ-order and (apart from endpoints) are disjoint, forming an a.e. partition of S^1. ∎

Lemma E (Boundary obstruction to finite-column tilings). [As before.] ∎

Corollary F (Quick non-column test for two-layer tiles). [As before.] ∎

Proposition G (q-phase generalization of the complementary 2-layer construction). [As before; incommensurability follows from the rational-shift Lemma R below by taking a=j/q, b=j′/q.] ∎

Proposition H (Completion of the K={0,1,2} two-order mechanism: non-column family with two incommensurable periods). Let K=(0,1,2) and c_i=b_i−a_i>0 with c_1+c_2+c_3=1. Assume c_1=c_3=s and s∉{1/m: m∈N}. Then there exist endpoints a_1,a_2,a_3 and an irrational slope β such that the tile A:=⋃_{i=1}^3({k_i}×[a_i,b_i]) admits two distinct singleton tilings corresponding to the cyclic orders σ=(1→2→3→1) and σ′=(1→3→2→1), with slopes β and β′≡β−s (mod 1), respectively. Both tilings are irreducible, their periods are incommensurable if s is rational, and A is not a column.
Proof. As before: Lemma C and its supplement give existence; Lemma B yields irreducibility (⟨K−K⟩=Z). If s∈Q and β∉Q, then β/β′∈Q would force β∈Q. Non-column follows from Lemma E at k=0 and k=2 since 1/s∉N. ∎

Supplement to Proposition D (explicit algebra). [As before.] ∎

Proposition I (Singleton rigidity for the |J_0|=1/2 complementary tiles). Let A=({0}×J_0)∪({1}×J_1) with J_1=S^1\(J_0+α) and |J_0|=|J_1|=1/2. Assume J_0 does not admit a two-translate partition of S^1 (i.e., there is no δ with J_0 ⊔ (J_0+δ)=S^1 a.e.). Then every tiling A+T=Z×S^1 satisfies |T_n|=1 for all n.
Proof. Let d_n:=|T_n|. The per-row measure identity gives d_n+d_{n−1}=2 for all n. If d_n=2 for some n, then d_{n−1}=0 and row n is covered solely by two disjoint translates of J_0, contradicting the hypothesis. Similarly, d_n=0 is impossible. Hence d_n=1 for all n. ∎

Corollary J (Row-to-row increment constraint in the complementary case). In the setting of Proposition I, writing T_n={θ_n}, for every m we have J_0+θ_m = J_0+(α+θ_{m−1}) a.e. Hence θ_m−θ_{m−1}−α∈Stab(J_0):={t∈S^1 : J_0+t=J_0 a.e.}. In particular, if J_0 has 1/q-periodicity and no finer translational invariance, then θ_m−θ_{m−1}∈α+(1/q)Z for all m.
Proof. From U_m=⋃_{θ∈T_m}(J_0+θ) and U_m=S^1\V_m with V_m=⋃_{θ∈T_{m−1}}(J_1+θ), Proposition I gives d_m=d_{m−1}=1, so U_m=J_0+θ_m and also U_m=J_0+(α+θ_{m−1}). Thus J_0+θ_m=J_0+(α+θ_{m−1}) a.e. The stabilizer conclusion follows immediately. ∎

Lemma R (Rational-shift incommensurability). If α∉Q and a≠b∈Q, then (α+a)/(α+b)∉Q. In particular, if α∉Q and r∈Q\{0}, then α/(α+r)∉Q.
Proof. If (α+a)/(α+b)=p/q∈Q, then α+a=(p/q)(α+b), so (1−p/q)α=(p/q)b−a∈Q. Since a≠b, 1−p/q≠0, hence α∈Q, a contradiction. The special case takes b=0 and a=r. ∎

Remark on endpoint conventions. Complements produce open arcs; choosing closed representatives modifies sets only on measure-zero boundaries and does not affect any a.e. tiling statements or measure identities above.
