Overall, the three reports are consistent with our current framework and add several genuinely useful, checkable tools. The main strengths are: (i) a clean Fourier “two-translate” obstruction lemma (P02, P03), with a concrete way to certify the delicate step in the |J_0|=1/2 complementary construction; (ii) two singletons-per-row rigidity results for complementary two-layer tiles: a quick integrality-based criterion (P01’s Lemma S) and a stronger hypothesis that forbids any m-fold translational partitions of J_0 and J_1 for m≥2 (P03’s Proposition K), both with short, correct proofs; (iii) a clear classification of singleton tilings in the complementary construction via the stabilizer Stab(J_0) (P01 Proposition K), which generalizes our Corollary J and anchors the “meandering” picture; (iv) a simple incommensurability algebra (P01 Lemma Q) that allows avoiding the “s rational” restriction in Proposition H by appropriate choice of β.
