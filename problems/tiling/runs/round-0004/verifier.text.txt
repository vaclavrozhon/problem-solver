{"feedback_md":"Overall, the three reports are consistent with our current framework and add several genuinely useful, checkable tools. The main strengths are: (i) a clean Fourier “two-translate” obstruction lemma (P02, P03), with a concrete way to certify the delicate step in the |J_0|=1/2 complementary construction; (ii) two singletons-per-row rigidity results for complementary two-layer tiles: a quick integrality-based criterion (P01’s Lemma S) and a stronger hypothesis that forbids any m-fold translational partitions of J_0 and J_1 for m≥2 (P03’s Proposition K), both with short, correct proofs; (iii) a clear classification of singleton tilings in the complementary construction via the stabilizer Stab(J_0) (P01 Proposition K), which generalizes our Corollary J and anchors the “meandering” picture; (iv) a simple incommensurability algebra (P01 Lemma Q) that allows avoiding the “s rational” restriction in Proposition H by appropriate choice of β.\n\nRigor audit and corrections:\n- Lemma C in output.md implicitly used that θ_n−θ_{n−1} is constant. This is guaranteed when 1∈K (or more generally under a helical-phase conclusion). We should explicitly note this assumption. I add a clarification remark rather than removing the lemma, since all our uses have 1∈K (K={0,1} or {0,1,2}).\n- Boundary obstruction: output.md still says “Lemma E (As before)”. I’ve inserted the explicit general (“aggregated-measure”) statement with proof. This removes the cross-reference ambiguity and upgrades the tool for arbitrary K.\n- Proposition I (|J_0|=1/2 singleton rigidity): the “Similarly, d_n=0 is impossible” step relies on the obvious equivalence that J_1 admits a 2-translate partition iff J_0 does. I include this one-line justification as an addendum.\n- The Fourier two-translate obstruction is formalized and added (with proof). Numeric checks such as P01’s Lemma F2 are fine for notes, but output.md only records the general lemma plus a simple explicit class (U=[0,c), c irrational) as a worked example in notes.\n\nValue triage:\n- Keep (and I have added to output.md): the explicit boundary lemma, the Fourier two-translate lemma, Lemma S (integrality-based singleton rigidity), the meandering classification (Proposition K), and the anti-m-tiling singleton rigidity (Proposition K2). These are clean, broadly applicable, and rigorously proved.\n- Retain in notes (not in output.md): specific numerical Fourier evaluations; the q=3 explicit instance is subsumed by the general Proposition G and can stay as an illustrative example in notes.\n\nNext steps (actionable):\n- Push the classification: When J_0 has exactly 1/q translational symmetry, try to prove the 1/q-offset in θ_m−θ_{m−1} must be constant (hence only the q helical tilings occur). A promising route is a three-row argument tracking boundary propagation and using the intersection identity; formalize a contradiction if two distinct offsets occur across consecutive increments.\n- Multi-translate Fourier obstructions: we now have the m=2 lemma. P03 sketched an m=3 obstruction; formalize and record a general “vector of Fourier mode constraints” for m translates. Provide at least one fully worked m=3 example.\n- For K={0,1,2}, systematize simultaneous compatibility for more than two orders (ℓ=4 with K={0,1,2,3}), compute the resulting linear constraints, and combine with the boundary lemma to force non-columnity and multiple periods. Aim for three or more pairwise incommensurable periods.\n- Update Proposition H’s incommensurability clause with Lemma Q: allow arbitrary s by choosing β with s/β∉Q.\n","new_notes_md":"Additions and clarifications (Round 0004)\n\n1) Clarification for Lemma C (singleton congruences)\n- The necessity part implicitly uses that the increment β:=θ_n−θ_{n−1} is constant in n. This is guaranteed when 1∈K (as in K={0,1} and K={0,1,2} used here), or more generally when the fixed order across rows implies a helical structure. All our applications satisfy 1∈K.\n\n2) Complementary two-layer: singleton tools\n- Integrality-based singleton rigidity. For A=({0}×J_0)∪({1}×J_1) with J_1=S^1\\(J_0+α), the per-row identity is |J_0| d_m + (1−|J_0|) d_{m−1}=1 and the intersection identity implies: if d_{m−1}≥1 then d_m≤1, and symmetrically. If either 1/|J_0|∉N or 1/(1−|J_0|)∉N then no d_m can be 0 (else we would force one of these reciprocals to be an integer), and the inequality forces d_m≤1. Thus d_m=1 for all m. This recovers singleton-per-row without the special |J_0|=1/2 case.\n- Anti-m-tiling singleton rigidity (stronger hypothesis). If neither J_0 nor J_1 admits any m-fold partition of S^1 by disjoint translates for any m≥2, then d_m=1 for all m: if d_{m−1}≥2, then |U_m|<|J_0| so d_m=0, which forces an m-tile by J_1; contradiction. Symmetrically, d_{m−1}=0 would force an m-tile by J_0. Hence all d’s are 1.\n- Meandering classification (singleton regime). Assuming d_m=1, the complementary structure forces J_0+θ_m = J_0+(α+θ_{m−1}) a.e., i.e. θ_m−θ_{m−1}−α ∈ Stab(J_0). Conversely, any sequence of increments in α+Stab(J_0) yields a valid singleton tiling. This exhibits many (often aperiodic) singleton tilings; helical ones are obtained by taking a constant offset.\n\n3) Fourier obstructions\n- Two-translate obstruction. If E+δ=S^1\\E a.e., then for any t≠0 with \\hat{1_E}(t)≠0 we have e^{2π i t δ}=−1. In particular, nonvanishing at two even modes (e.g., t=2 and t=4) forbids such δ since no δ can satisfy both e^{4π i δ}=−1 and e^{8π i δ}=−1 simultaneously.\n- Worked class: if J_0=U∪(U+1/2) with U=[0,c) and c∉Q, then \\hat{1_{J_0}}(2k)=2\\hat{1_U}(2k) with \\hat{1_U}(2k)=(e^{4π i k c}−1)/(4π i k)≠0 for all k≥1, so no two-translate complement exists. This gives an easy certification for many explicit choices of U (including variants of Theorem A when |J_0|≠1/2).\n- Sketch for m=3 (to be formalized): If \\hat{1_E}(t) and \\hat{1_E}(2t) are nonzero and S^1 is partitioned a.e. by three translates of E, then the sums of first and second powers of e^{2π i t δ_j} vanish simultaneously, which is incompatible unless the three are cube roots of unity up to rotation; that in turn contradicts the second equation. This yields a quick “no 3-translate tiling” test.\n\n4) Incommensurability algebra\n- If s/β∉Q then β/(β−s)∉Q. Thus, in the K={0,1,2} two-order family, one can ensure incommensurability by choosing β so that s/β is irrational (no need to assume s rational).\n\n5) Symmetry of two-translate complements\n- E+δ=S^1\\E a.e. iff (S^1\\E)+δ=E a.e. Hence “no two-translate tiling” is symmetric under complement and translation. This justifies the symmetric step in the |J_0|=1/2 singleton rigidity proof.\n\n6) Concrete directions\n- Prove that when Stab(J_0)=(1/q)Z with no finer invariance, the offsets θ_m−θ_{m−1}−α (mod 1/q) must be constant across m; deduce that only the q helical tilings occur in that regime.\n- Formalize the m=3 Fourier obstruction and apply it to explicit J_0 at |J_0|=1/3 to enforce the hypotheses of the anti-m-tiling singleton rigidity.\n- For K={0,1,2,3}, enumerate fixed orders, write the congruence systems, and search for simultaneous compatibilities; combine with boundary integrality to certify non-columnity and extract ≥3 incommensurable periods.\n","new_notes_append":"True","new_outputs_md":"Additions, clarifications, and new tools\n\nRemark (clarification for Lemma C). In the necessity direction we used the identity θ_{m−k_i}−θ_{m−k_{σ(i)}}=(k_{σ(i)}−k_i)β with β:=θ_n−θ_{n−1} independent of n. This constancy holds when 1∈K (as in our applications K={0,1} and {0,1,2}). For general K one needs a helical-phase conclusion from the fixed-order hypothesis before specializing to a constant β.\n\nLemma E (Boundary obstruction to finite-column tilings: explicit statement). Let A=\\bigcup_i\\{k_i\\}×[a_i,b_i] and, for each height k, let the aggregated layer be J_k:=\\bigcup_{i: k_i=k}[a_i,b_i] with measure μ_k:=|J_k|. Suppose A+T=X×S^1 with X finite, and write d_n:=|T_n|. Then for all m∈Z we have the per-row identity\n  \\sum_k μ_k · d_{m−k} = 1_{m∈X}.\nIf p:=min X and k_min:=min\\{k_i\\}, then only anchors at z=p−k_min can contribute to row p, hence μ_{k_min}·d_{p−k_min}=1. Similarly, if q:=max X and k_max:=max\\{k_i\\}, then μ_{k_max}·d_{q−k_max}=1. In particular, if 1/μ_{k_min}∉N or 1/μ_{k_max}∉N, then no such finite-column tiling exists (A is not a column).\nProof. The per-row identity is the a.e. disjointness of the row-unions. The boundary constraints follow by localization: any anchor z<p−k_min would create coverage below p; any anchor z=p−k with k>k_min creates coverage at row p−(k−k_min)<p. Thus only z=p−k_min contributes to row p, where S^1 is partitioned a.e. by d_{p−k_min} copies of J_{k_min}. The right boundary is analogous. ∎\n\nLemma T (Fourier two-translate obstruction). Let E⊂S^1 be measurable. If there exists δ with E+δ = S^1\\E a.e., then for every t∈Z\\{0} with \\hat{1_E}(t)≠0 we have e^{2π i t δ}=−1. In particular, if \\hat{1_E}(2) and \\hat{1_E}(4) are both nonzero, no such δ can exist.\nProof. Taking Fourier coefficients in 1_{E+δ}+1_E=1 gives e^{2π i t δ} \\hat{1_E}(t)+\\hat{1_E}(t)=0 for all t≠0, hence e^{2π i t δ}=−1 whenever \\hat{1_E}(t)≠0. For t=2 and t=4 this would impose δ≡1/2 (mod 1) and δ≡1/4 (mod 1) simultaneously, impossible. ∎\n\nProposition S (Singleton rigidity via integrality exclusion for complementary two-layer tiles). Let A=({0}×J_0)∪({1}×J_1) with J_1=S^1\\(J_0+α). If either 1/|J_0|∉N or 1/|J_1|=1/(1−|J_0|)∉N, then every tiling A+T=Z×S^1 satisfies |T_n|=1 for all n.\nProof. Let d_n:=|T_n| and U_n:=\\bigcup_{θ∈T_n}(J_0+θ). The intersection identity yields U_n = \\bigcap_{θ∈T_{n−1}}(J_0+α+θ) a.e., hence if d_{n−1}≥1 then |U_n|≤|J_0| and therefore d_n≤1 (since U_n is a disjoint union of d_n copies of J_0). If some d_m=0, then the per-row measure identity |J_0| d_m + (1−|J_0|) d_{m−1}=1 forces (1−|J_0|) d_{m−1}=1, contradicting 1/(1−|J_0|)∉N. Symmetrically, if some d_{m−1}=0, then |J_0| d_m=1 contradicts 1/|J_0|∉N. Thus no d is 0; since d_{n−1}≥1 we get d_n≤1 for all n, hence d_n=1. ∎\n\nProposition K (Meandering classification of singleton tilings for the complementary construction). Let A=({0}×J_0)∪({1}×J_1) with J_1=S^1\\(J_0+α). Suppose A+T=Z×S^1 is singleton per row (T_n={θ_n}). Then for every n,\n  J_0+θ_n = J_0+(α+θ_{n−1}) a.e., equivalently Δ_n:=θ_n−θ_{n−1}−α ∈ Stab(J_0):=\\{t∈S^1 : J_0+t=J_0 a.e.\\}.\nConversely, for any bi-infinite sequence (Δ_n) with values in Stab(J_0), the sequence θ_n:=θ_0+\\sum_{j=1}^n(α+Δ_j) defines a singleton tiling T={(n,θ_n)}.\nProof. The “only if” follows from U_n=J_0+θ_n=S^1\\V_n and V_n=\\bigcup_{θ∈T_{n−1}}(J_1+θ)=S^1\\(J_0+α+θ_{n−1}). The “if” direction: if Δ_n∈Stab(J_0), then J_0+θ_n=J_0+α+θ_{n−1} a.e., so in row n the two contributions are complementary a.e., giving a tiling with a.e. disjointness across all rows. ∎\n\nProposition K2 (Singleton rigidity for complementary two-layer tiles under anti-m-tiling hypotheses). Let A=({0}×J_0)∪({1}×J_1) with J_1=S^1\\(J_0+α). Suppose neither J_0 nor J_1 admits an m-fold partition of S^1 by pairwise a.e. disjoint translates for any integer m≥2. Then every tiling A+T=Z×S^1 is singleton per row: |T_n|=1 for all n.\nProof. Let d_n:=|T_n| and U_n:=\\bigcup_{θ∈T_n}(J_0+θ), V_n:=\\bigcup_{θ∈T_{n−1}}(J_1+θ). As before U_n⊔V_n=S^1 a.e. and U_n=\\bigcap_{θ∈T_{n−1}}(J_0+α+θ) a.e. If d_{n−1}≥2, then there exist θ≠θ′ in T_{n−1} with θ′−θ∉Stab(J_1)=Stab(J_0), hence |(J_0+α+θ)∩(J_0+α+θ′)|<|J_0| and thus |U_n|<|J_0|, forcing d_n=0. Then V_n=S^1 a.e., so S^1 is the a.e. disjoint union of d_{n−1} copies of J_1, i.e. an m-translate tiling with m=d_{n−1}≥2, a contradiction. Hence d_{n−1}≤1; by symmetry d_n≤1. Finally, d_{n−1}=0 would force U_n=S^1 and hence an m-translate tiling by J_0 with m=d_n≥2, again a contradiction. Therefore d_{n−1}=d_n=1 for all n. ∎\n\nLemma Q (Incommensurability via ratio). If s∈(0,1) and β∉Q satisfy s/β∉Q, then β/(β−s)∉Q.\nProof. If β/(β−s)=p/q∈Q, then (q−p)β=ps, hence s/β=(q−p)/p∈Q, a contradiction. ∎\n\nAddendum to Proposition I. The symmetric step “d_n=0 is impossible” uses that J_1 admits a two-translate partition iff J_0 does: E+δ=S^1\\E a.e. iff (S^1\\E)+δ=E a.e. Since J_1 is a translate of S^1\\J_0, the hypothesis for J_0 automatically forbids the corresponding partition for J_1. ∎\n","new_outputs_append":"True","verdict":"partial success"}
