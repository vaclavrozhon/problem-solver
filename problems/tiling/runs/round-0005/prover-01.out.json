  "progress_md": "Round 0005 \u2014 audit, formalizations, and small structural lemmas\n\nAudit of output.md (gaps, clarifications, corrections)\n- Meandering vs \u201cconstant increment\u201d rigidity. Output now correctly includes Proposition K (any singleton tiling in the complementary two-layer construction is parameterized by arbitrary increments \u0394_n\u2208Stab(J_0)). However, two places still list as a \u201cnext target\u201d to prove that \u03b8_m\u2212\u03b8_{m\u22121}\u2212\u03b1 is constant modulo 1/q. This goal contradicts Proposition K unless one restricts to periodic tilings (or imposed extra structure). Suggest replacing that target with \u201cclassify periodic tilings: \u0394_n periodic \u21d2 a period (r, r\u03b1+\u2211_{j=1}^r\u0394_j).\u201d I give the precise statement and proof below.\n- Theorem A non-column step (component-length obstruction). The current text invokes a component-length mismatch but does not state the necessary lemma explicitly. I provide a short, clean lemma (\u201ccomponent-length obstruction\u201d) that justifies this step for any finite union of intervals E\u2282S^1: if the multiset of component lengths of E differs from the multiset of gap lengths, then no translate of E can equal its complement a.e. This closes the only missing justification in (iii) for |J_0|=1/2.\n- Proposition H (incommensurability clause). The statement assumes s rational; output later records Lemma Q (s/\u03b2\u2209Q \u21d2 \u03b2/(\u03b2\u2212s)\u2209Q). I recommend adding to Prop. H a remark that one can ensure incommensurability for arbitrary s by choosing \u03b2 with s/\u03b2\u2209Q.\n- Boundary tool. The explicit aggregated-measure Lemma E is now present (good). I add a small corollary (below) ruling out \u201csingle-row columns\u201d whenever k_min<k_max; this can be cited for K={0,1,2} as a quick structural check.\n\nNew lemmas and micro-results (auditable)\n\n1) Component-length obstruction to complementary translation\n- Lemma (component-length obstruction). Let E\u2282S^1 be a finite union of closed intervals with pairwise disjoint interiors. Write L(E) for the multiset of lengths of its connected components, and G(E) for the multiset of cyclic gap-lengths between consecutive endpoints of E. If there exists \u03b4 with E+\u03b4 = S^1\\E a.e., then L(E)=G(E) as multisets. In particular, if L(E)\u2260G(E), such \u03b4 cannot exist.\n- Proof. Translation preserves component lengths, so L(E+\u03b4)=L(E). The complement S^1\\E is exactly the disjoint union (up to endpoints) of the gaps between consecutive endpoints of E, so its component-length multiset is G(E). If E+\u03b4=S^1\\E a.e., then L(E)=L(E+\u03b4)=L(S^1\\E)=G(E).\n- Why useful here. This formalizes the non-column step in Theorem A when |J_0|=1/2: our chosen U ensures L(J_0)\u2260G(J_0), hence J_0 cannot be a complementary translate of itself, forbidding the 2-translate partition forced at the boundary.\n\n2) Periods from periodic increments in the meandering classification\n- Proposition (periodicity of T from periodic \u0394). In the setting of Proposition K (complementary two-layer, singleton-per-row), suppose the increments \u0394_n:=\u03b8_n\u2212\u03b8_{n\u22121}\u2212\u03b1 take values in Stab(J_0) and are periodic of period r, i.e., \u0394_{n+r}=\u0394_n for all n. Then T has period (r, \u03b1_r) with\n  \u03b1_r := r\u03b1 + \u2211_{j=1}^r \u0394_j  (in S^1).\n- Proof. From \u03b8_{n}\u2212\u03b8_{n\u22121}=\u03b1+\u0394_n, we have \u03b8_{n+r}\u2212\u03b8_n = r\u03b1 + \u2211_{j=1}^r \u0394_{n+j}. If \u0394 is r-periodic, the sum is independent of n and equals \u2211_{j=1}^r \u0394_j. Hence T_{n+r} = T_n + \u03b1_r for all n.\n- Why useful here. This replaces the (now incorrect) \u201cconstant increment\u201d rigidity target by a correct periodic-\u0394 classification of periodic tilings. As a corollary, the helical families in Theorem A and Prop. G correspond to r=1 with constant \u0394.\n\n3) No single-row column when the tile spans multiple heights\n- Lemma (no one-row columns if k_min<k_max). Let A=\u22c3_i {k_i}\u00d7[a_i,b_i] with k_min:=min{k_i}<k_max:=max{k_i}. Then there is no tiling A+T={p}\u00d7S^1 with a single row p. More generally, no connected component of a finite-column set X\u2282Z can have size < (k_max\u2212k_min)+1.\n- Proof (single-row case). If A+T={p}\u00d7S^1, any anchor (z,\u03b8) that contributes to row p via some height k\u2032 (i.e., z+k\u2032=p) also produces contributions at rows z+k for all k\u2208{k_i}. Since k_max>k\u2032, the same anchor contributes to row p+(k_max\u2212k\u2032) > p, contradicting A+T\u2282{p}\u00d7S^1. The general bound follows by the same argument applied at both ends of a connected component [p,q]: any anchor contributing to the left endpoint generates coverage extending at least k_max\u2212k_min rows to the right, hence the component must have length \u2265 (k_max\u2212k_min)+1.\n- Why useful here. This gives an immediate structural constraint on prospective columns and can be combined with the boundary integrality (Lemma E) to streamline non-column checks for multi-height tiles (e.g., K={0,1,2}).\n\n4) Quick corollary for K={0,1,2}\n- Corollary. For K={0,1,2}, any finite column component X\u2229[p,q] must satisfy q\u2212p\u22652. At the left boundary c_1 d_p=1 and at the right boundary c_3 d_{q\u22122}=1, hence 1/c_1,1/c_3\u2208N. If c_1/c_3\u2209Q, this is impossible; thus A is not a column. (This complements Lemma E\u2019s \u201cnot a reciprocal\u201d test.)\n\nExamples and sanity checks\n- Theorem A (|J_0|=1/2). With U=[0,0.2]\u222a[0.3,0.35], L(J_0)={0.2,0.05,0.2,0.05}, while G(J_0)={0.1,0.15,0.1,0.15}; Lemma (component-length obstruction) forbids J_0+\u03b4=S^1\\J_0. Combined with the boundary argument, (iii) follows. (Fourier Lemma T gives an alternative certificate.)\n- Periodic \u0394 example. In the complementary construction with J_0+1/2=J_0, let \u0394_n alternate between 0 and 1/2. Then r=2 and \u03b1_2=2\u03b1+1/2, so T has period (2, 2\u03b1+1/2). This exhibits a third periodic tiling (beyond T_\u03b1 and T_{\u03b1+1/2}) for the same tile, consistent with Proposition K.\n\nWhy these help the program\n- The component-length lemma closes a justification gap in Theorem A\u2019s non-column proof for |J_0|=1/2 using a minimal, checkable combinatorial invariant.\n- The periodic-\u0394 proposition corrects and refines the \u201crigidity\u201d narrative: it identifies exactly when an arbitrary meandering singleton tiling is periodic, subsuming the helical cases.\n- The \u201cno single-row component\u201d lemma plus Lemma E yields easy, general non-column criteria (and prohibits tiny components) for multi-height tiles like K={0,1,2}.\n\nObstacles and cautions\n- m=3 Fourier obstruction. We still have only a sketch for \u201cno 3-translate partition\u201d based on two nonzero modes; a full proof requires a short algebraic lemma on unit-modulus sums (I will write it out next). Until then, use Lemma T (m=2) and integrality exclusions (Prop. S) to certify singleton rigidity.\n- Endpoint choices remain a.e.; all statements are robust under null perturbations (as recorded in the endpoint remark).\n\nActionable next steps for output.md\n- Add the component-length obstruction lemma immediately after the Fourier Lemma T and cite it in Theorem A(iii). This makes that step fully formal without Fourier.\n- Insert the periodic-\u0394 proposition as a corollary to Proposition K (\u201cclassification of periodic singleton tilings\u201d); update the \u201cNext targets\u201d to reflect this correct structure (drop the constant-increment aim).\n- Add the \u201cno single-row component\u201d lemma as a corollary of Lemma E (or as a separate observation) and reference it in the K={0,1,2} discussion.\n- In Proposition H, append a remark: incommensurability also holds whenever s/\u03b2\u2209Q (Lemma Q), allowing arbitrary s by appropriate \u03b2.\n\n"
