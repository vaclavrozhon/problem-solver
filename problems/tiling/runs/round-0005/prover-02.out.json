  "progress_md": "Round 0005 \u2014 audit corrections, new Fourier obstruction (m=3), and two structural lemmas\n\nGaps and corrections in output.md (to fix explicitly)\n- Incorrect \u201cm=3 Fourier obstruction\u201d sketch. In \u201cFourier obstructions\u201d the sketch claims that requiring both \u2211 e^{2\u03c0 i t \u03b4_j}=0 and \u2211 e^{2\u03c0 i 2t \u03b4_j}=0 for three translates is impossible unless the \u03b4_j are (rotated) cube roots of unity, and then asserts this contradicts the second equation. This is not correct: if z_j are a rotated triple of cube roots of unity, then both sums at t and 2t vanish. So the stated sketch cannot be used as an obstruction.\n  \u2022 Corrected usable obstruction (see Lemma M3 below): for three translates, the simultaneous vanishing at frequencies t and 3t is impossible when both Fourier coefficients \\(\\hat{1_E}(t),\\hat{1_E}(3t)\\neq0\\). This should replace the current sketch.\n- Minor duplication. Lemma E appears first as \u201c[As before]\u201d and later as a full statement with proof. For coherence, keep only the explicit statement with proof and ensure earlier references point to it.\n- Minor precision in Lemma T\u2019s proof. It says \u201cfor t=2 and t=4 this would impose \u03b4\u22611/2 and \u03b4\u22611/4 simultaneously.\u201d The precise congruences are e^{4\u03c0 i \u03b4}=\u22121 \u21d2 \u03b4\u22611/4 (mod 1/2) and e^{8\u03c0 i \u03b4}=\u22121 \u21d2 \u03b4\u22611/8 (mod 1/4). The contradiction remains, but stating moduli avoids confusion.\n- Proposition H\u2019s incommensurability clause. The \u201cs rational\u201d hypothesis is sufficient but not necessary. Lemma Q already included shows an alternative: choose \u03b2 with s/\u03b2\u2209Q; then \u03b2/(\u03b2\u2212s)\u2209Q. It would be good to mention this option in the main body of Proposition H (not only in the \u201cAdditions\u201d section).\n\nNew small lemmas (auditable) to add\n1) Lemma M3 (Fourier obstruction to 3-translate tilings via t and 3t)\n- Statement. Let E\u2282S^1 be measurable. If S^1 is a.e. the disjoint union of three translates E+\u03b4_1,E+\u03b4_2,E+\u03b4_3, then for every t\u2208Z\\{0} with \\(\\hat{1_E}(t)\\neq0\\) one has \\(\\sum_{j=1}^3 e^{2\\pi i t\\,\\delta_j}=0\\). In particular, if there exists t with \\(\\hat{1_E}(t)\\neq0\\) and \\(\\hat{1_E}(3t)\\neq0\\), then no such 3-translate tiling exists.\n- Proof. The identity 1=\u2211_{j=1}^3 1_{E+\u03b4_j} a.e. gives, for t\u22600, \\(\\sum_j e^{2\\pi i t\\delta_j}\\,\\hat{1_E}(t)=0\\). If both \\(\\hat{1_E}(t),\\hat{1_E}(3t)\\neq0\\), then with x_j:=e^{2\\pi i t\\delta_j} we must have \\(\\sum_j x_j=0\\) and \\(\\sum_j x_j^3=0\\). By Newton\u2019s identity for three variables, \\(\\sum_j x_j^3 = 3 x_1 x_2 x_3\\). Since each x_j has unit modulus, the product is nonzero, so \\(\\sum_j x_j^3\\neq0\\), a contradiction. \u220e\n- Why useful here. This supplies a correct and sharp obstruction for m=3 (replacing the incorrect sketch). It lets us forbid 3-fold partitions for concrete E by checking two Fourier modes t and 3t.\n\n2) Lemma P (Periodicity of singleton complementary tilings \u21d4 periodicity of increments)\n- Setting. In the complementary two-layer construction A=({0}\u00d7J_0)\u222a({1}\u00d7(S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1))) assume the tiling is singleton-per-row, T_n={\u03b8_n}, and write increments \u0394_n:=\u03b8_n\u2212\u03b8_{n\u22121}\u2212\u03b1 \u2208 Stab(J_0) (Proposition K).\n- Claim. T has period (r,\u03b1_*) iff (i) \u0394_{n+r}=\u0394_n for all n (r-periodicity), and (ii) \\(\\alpha_* \\equiv r\\alpha + \\sum_{j=1}^r \\Delta_j\\) (mod 1).\n- Proof. T has period (r,\u03b1_*) iff \u03b8_{n+r}\u2212\u03b8_n is independent of n and equals \u03b1_* (mod 1). But \u03b8_{n+r}\u2212\u03b8_n = r\u03b1 + \u2211_{j=1}^r \u0394_{n+j}. Thus constancy in n is equivalent to \u0394_{n+r}\u2212\u0394_n=0 for all n (by taking successive differences of r-window sums), and the constant value equals r\u03b1+\u2211_{j=1}^r\u0394_j, yielding \u03b1_*. \u220e\n- Consequence. Choosing a nonperiodic sequence (\u0394_n)\u2208Stab(J_0)^Z produces an aperiodic (yet irreducible) tiling. For q=2 (Stab(J_0)={0,1/2}), any nonperiodic 0\u20131 sequence gives an aperiodic tiling.\n\n3) Lemma R\u2032 (Two-sided boundary obstruction via rational independence)\n- Statement. Let A be any tile with aggregated boundary measures \u03bc_{k_min}, \u03bc_{k_max} at the lowest and highest heights, respectively. If A tiles a finite set X\u00d7S^1, Lemma E forces \u03bc_{k_min}=1/d_L and \u03bc_{k_max}=1/d_R for some d_L,d_R\u2208N. Hence \u03bc_{k_min}/\u03bc_{k_max}=d_R/d_L\u2208Q. Therefore, if \u03bc_{k_min}/\u03bc_{k_max}\u2209Q, A cannot be a column.\n- Proof. Immediate from Lemma E\u2019s boundary equalities and d_L,d_R\u2208N. \u220e\n- Use. This strengthens easy non-column tests: for K={0,1,2} with one interval per layer, if c_1/c_3 is irrational then A is not a column, regardless of c_2.\n\nExamples and quick checks\n- Corrected Fourier m=3 certificate: Take E=U\u222a(U+1/3)\u222a(U+2/3) with U=[0,c) and choose c so that \\(\\hat{1_E}(1)\\neq0\\) and \\(\\hat{1_E}(3)\\neq0\\) (true for generic c). Then by Lemma M3, E cannot 3-tile S^1 by translations. This provides a clean \u201canti-3-tiling\u201d hypothesis to feed into Proposition K2 when |E|=1/3.\n- Aperiodic irreducible tilings in the complementary q=2 case: Let J_0 be as in Theorem A (for which singleton rigidity holds). Pick any nonperiodic bi-infinite sequence \u03b5_n\u2208{0,1} and put \u0394_n:=\u03b5_n\u00b7(1/2). Then T_n={\u03b8_0+n\u03b1+\u2211_{j=1}^n\u0394_j} defines a tiling by Proposition K. By Lemma P, T has no period (k,\u03b1_*). Irreducibility follows as in Lemma B (gcd(K\u2212K)=1).\n\nWhy useful here\n- Lemma M3 repairs and strengthens the Fourier toolkit for m=3, replacing an incorrect sketch and giving a crisp, checkable obstruction in a delicate case (|E|=1/3) that our boundary lemma alone does not exclude.\n- Lemma P formalizes the exact relationship between periods and increment sequences in the complementary construction. It both explains the source of many periods (constant increments) and guarantees the existence of aperiodic irreducible tilings when increments meander.\n- Lemma R\u2032 packages a very simple non-column test that only inspects the two boundary layers; it is immediately applicable to many K (including K={0,1,2}).\n\nObstacles and cautions\n- Fourier obstructions beyond m=2 and m=3. For m\u22654, requiring p_1=\u2211z_j=0 does not in general force p_m=\u2211z_j^m\u22600, so the t and mt strategy may not yield a contradiction. Stronger multi-frequency constraints (a set T of t\u2019s with \\(\\hat{1_E}(t)\\neq0\\)) or structural assumptions on E are likely needed.\n- Classification for q\u22653. Proposition K gives the meandering classification but does not force constant increments modulo 1/q. Proving rigidity (only the q helical tilings) seems to require an additional nondegeneracy hypothesis; current attempts via two- or three-row endpoint propagation have not yet yielded a contradiction when offsets vary.\n\nNext steps (concrete, testable updates to output.md)\n1) Replace the incorrect m=3 Fourier sketch by Lemma M3 (t and 3t obstruction) with its short proof. Optionally add a brief worked example class (E as a 1/3-periodic union of intervals with nonvanishing \\(\\hat{1_E}(1),\\hat{1_E}(3)\\)).\n2) Insert Lemma P (periodicity \u21d4 periodic increments) after Proposition K; add a one-line corollary: aperiodic increments produce aperiodic irreducible tilings.\n3) Add Lemma R\u2032 (boundary rational independence) to the \u201cBoundary tools\u201d and cite it in the K={0,1,2} section as an alternative non-column certificate when c_1/c_3\u2209Q.\n4) In Proposition H, append: \u201cAlternatively, incommensurability holds whenever s/\u03b2\u2209Q (Lemma Q), allowing arbitrary s by a suitable choice of \u03b2.\u201d\n5) Minor housekeeping: remove the first \u201c[As before]\u201d occurrence of Lemma E in favor of the explicit statement later, and refine the modulus wording in Lemma T\u2019s proof as noted above.\n\nThese are all incremental, auditable changes that close a correctness gap (m=3 Fourier), add two compact structural lemmas, and expand the stock of easy-to-verify non-column and aperiodicity criteria."
