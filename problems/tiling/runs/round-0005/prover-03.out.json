For consistency and auditability, the placeholder should be removed or replaced by the explicit statement (the latter is already correct and sufficiently general via aggregated layers J_k with measures \u03bc_k).\n- Minor but real arithmetic slip in Lemma T (Fourier two-translate obstruction). The proof concludes \u201cfor t=2 and t=4 this would impose \u03b4\u22611/2 and \u03b4\u22611/4 simultaneously.\u201d The correct implication of e^{2\u03c0 i t \u03b4}=\u22121 is t\u03b4\u22611/2 (mod 1). Thus for t=2 one gets \u03b4\u22611/4 (mod 1/2), and for t=4 one gets \u03b4\u22611/8 (mod 1/4). These congruences have no common solution modulo 1, which is the intended contradiction. The fix is easy (replace \u03b4\u22611/2 by 2\u03b4\u22611/2, etc.).\n- Theorem A, proof of (iii). The line \u201c(iii) can also be deduced from Corollary F by instead choosing |J_0|\u2209{1/m}\u201d changes the data of the theorem (J_0 was fixed with |J_0|=1/2). This is fine as a variant but should be flagged as a separate remark (Theorem A\u2032). As written in the main proof, the non-column argument appeals to component-length mismatch; that is correct but it would help to cross-reference Lemma T as an alternate short certificate in the present example.\n- Proposition H (incommensurability clause). The statement assumes s rational. Since Lemma Q is now recorded, one can add: \u201cMore generally, incommensurability holds whenever s/\u03b2\u2209Q\u201d (choose \u03b2 accordingly). Suggest adding this as an inline remark after the current sentence to broaden applicability without changing the core proof.\n- \u201cAs before\u201d placeholders. Proposition G is referenced \u201cAs before.\u201d Given the short proof (phase transport plus J_0+1/q=J_0), I recommend inserting a brief proof sketch or an explicit reference to the earlier established argument so that output.md is self-contained.\n\nNew small lemmas/propositions (incremental, auditable)\n1) Period from periodic meanders (complementary two-layer, singleton regime)\n- Lemma (period-lifting). In Proposition K\u2019s setting (singleton, \u0394_n\u2208Stab(J_0)), if \u0394_n has period r and S:=\u2211_{j=1}^r \u0394_j, then T has period (r, r\u03b1+S): \u03b8_{n+r}\u2212\u03b8_n = r\u03b1+S for all n. Conversely, any choice of r and S\u2208r\u00b7Stab(J_0) is realizable by some periodic \u0394_n.\n- Proof. \u03b8_{n+r}\u2212\u03b8_n = \u2211_{j=1}^r(\u03b1+\u0394_{n+j}) = r\u03b1 + \u2211_{j=1}^r\u0394_{n+j} = r\u03b1+S by r-periodicity of \u0394. The converse is obtained by picking any r-periodic \u0394 with sum S.\n- Why useful here. Packages how meandering increments generate periods beyond the constant-increment (helical) case; helps enumerate all periodic tilings produced by a given J_0 (especially when Stab(J_0)=(1/q)Z).\n\n2) Two-sided boundary obstruction (quick non-column via rational independence)\n- Corollary (to Lemma E). With k_min:=min K and k_max:=max K, let \u03bc_{min}:=|J_{k_min}| and \u03bc_{max}:=|J_{k_max}|. If A tiles a finite X\u00d7S^1, then \u03bc_{min}d_{p\u2212k_min}=1 and \u03bc_{max}d_{q\u2212k_max}=1 at the leftmost and rightmost boundary rows p=min X, q=max X. If \u03bc_{min} and \u03bc_{max} are rationally independent over Q, this is impossible. Hence A is not a column.\n- Why useful here. This complements Lemma E with a concrete algebraic obstruction often met in K={0,1,2} with asymmetric endpoint measures.\n\n3) Symmetry of stabilizers (used implicitly in K2)\n- Lemma. For any measurable E\u2282S^1 and any \u03b1\u2208S^1, Stab(E)=Stab(S^1\\E)=Stab(E+\u03b1) (a.e.).\n- Proof. 1_{S^1\\E} = 1\u22121_E and 1_{E+\u03b1}(x)=1_E(x\u2212\u03b1) imply equality of stabilizers a.e. This justifies Stab(J_1)=Stab(J_0) used in Proposition K2.\n- Why useful here. Makes an implicit step explicit and reusable.\n\nSmall examples/sanity checks (consistent with current framework)\n- q=3 complementary family with many periods. Choose U=[0,t) with t=\u221a2/30, set J_0:=U\u222a(U+1/3)\u222a(U+2/3) so |J_0|=3t\u2209{1/m}. For irrational \u03b1 (e.g., \u221a3/10 mod 1), Proposition G gives three tilings with periods (1,\u03b1+j/3), pairwise incommensurable by Lemma R. Lemma E yields non-column; Proposition S makes all tilings singleton-per-row.\n- K={0,1,2} two-order with rational independence at the boundary. Take c_1=\u221a2/5, c_2=1\u22122c_1, c_3=c_1 (valid since 2c_1<1); then 1/c_1, 1/c_3\u2209N and are rationally independent with each other, so the boundary corollary forbids finite columns. Two orders exist by Lemma C; incommensurability by Lemma Q after choosing \u03b2 so that c_1/\u03b2\u2209Q.\n\nObstacles and failure modes (why some approaches don\u2019t go further)\n- Constancy of increments \u0394_n. Proposition K shows many singleton tilings with \u0394_n varying in Stab(J_0) exist; thus a global \u201call tilings helical\u201d classification is false without extra rigidity. Any attempt to force \u0394_n constant must impose additional structure (e.g., forbid certain patterns via combinatorial propagation or impose extra symmetry on J_0), which is not presently available.\n- Using the boundary lemma alone at |J_0|=1/2. The integrality d_p=2 at the boundary is compatible with measure; forbidding it requires a separate obstruction (component-length or Fourier). This is already addressed (good), but worth keeping in mind for future examples at |E|=1/m.\n\nActionable edits to output.md (concise)\n- Fix Lemma T\u2019s last line as noted: replace \u201c\u03b4\u22611/2 and \u03b4\u22611/4\u201d by \u201c2\u03b4\u22611/2 and 4\u03b4\u22611/2 (mod 1), i.e., \u03b4\u22611/4 (mod 1/2) and \u03b4\u22611/8 (mod 1/4), which are incompatible.\u201d\n- Remove the earlier \u201cLemma E [As before]\u201d placeholder; keep the explicit version with proof.\n- Move the \u201cvariant |J_0|\u2209{1/m}\u201d comment from within Theorem A\u2019s proof (iii) into a separate remark (Theorem A\u2032) to avoid changing parameters mid-proof.\n- After Proposition H, add: \u201cBy Lemma Q, incommensurability also holds whenever s/\u03b2\u2209Q (thus for any s one can choose \u03b2 accordingly).\u201d\n- Optionally add the period-lifting lemma to the complementary two-layer section; it succinctly classifies periodic tilings generated by meandering increments.\n\nNext steps (concrete, testable)\n- Formalize and insert the \u201cperiod-lifting\u201d lemma and the two-sided boundary corollary into output.md.\n- Provide a brief proof sketch for Proposition G in situ (phase transport using J_0+1/q=J_0 and complementarity) to eliminate \u201cAs before.\u201d\n- Add an explicit worked example (e.g., the q=3 construction above) to demonstrate multiple incommensurable periods and non-columnity in a single place, referencing Lemma T or Lemma E as appropriate.\n- Extend Fourier obstructions to m=3 rigorously (already sketched in notes), then apply to an explicit |J_0|=1/3 example to certify the anti-m-tiling hypothesis in Proposition K2.\n"
