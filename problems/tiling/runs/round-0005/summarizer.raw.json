Housekeeping: remove duplicate Lemma E, fix modulus arithmetic in Lemma T, and add an incommensurability remark to Proposition H (via s/β ∉ Q). Action items: replace the incorrect m=3 sketch with Lemma M3 and a worked example, insert the period-lifting lemma and boundary tests into output.md, and update the “Next targets” to drop the impossible constant-increment rigidity in favor of periodic-Δ classification.
