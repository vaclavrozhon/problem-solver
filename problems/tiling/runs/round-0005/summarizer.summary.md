Round 0005 performed a careful audit of output.md and introduced several small, auditable lemmas and fixes that close gaps and correct incorrect sketches. Major additions: a component-length obstruction lemma that fills the remaining step in Theorem A for |J_0|=1/2; a correct m=3 Fourier obstruction (Lemma M3) using frequencies t and 3t; a period-lifting lemma showing T is periodic iff the increments Δ_n are periodic, with period data α_* = rα + Σ_{j=1}^r Δ_j (so nonperiodic Δ produce aperiodic singleton tilings); a “no single-row column” lemma and a two-sided boundary rational-independence test that give quick non-column certificates (useful for K={0,1,2}). Housekeeping: remove duplicate Lemma E, fix modulus arithmetic in Lemma T, and add an incommensurability remark to Proposition H (via s/β ∉ Q). Action items: replace the incorrect m=3 sketch with Lemma M3 and a worked example, insert the period-lifting lemma and boundary tests into output.md, and update the “Next targets” to drop the impossible constant-increment rigidity in favor of periodic-Δ classification.
