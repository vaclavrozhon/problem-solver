  "summary_md": "Round 0005 performed a careful audit of output.md and introduced several small, auditable lemmas and fixes that close gaps and correct incorrect sketches. Major additions: a component-length obstruction lemma that fills the remaining step in Theorem A for |J_0|=1/2; a correct m=3 Fourier obstruction (Lemma M3) using frequencies t and 3t; a period-lifting lemma showing T is periodic iff the increments Δ_n are periodic, with period data α_* = rα + Σ_{j=1}^r Δ_j (so nonperiodic Δ produce aperiodic singleton tilings); a “no single-row column” lemma and a two-sided boundary rational-independence test that give quick non-column certificates (useful for K={0,1,2}). Housekeeping: remove duplicate Lemma E, fix modulus arithmetic in Lemma T, and add an incommensurability remark to Proposition H (via s/β ∉ Q). Action items: replace the incorrect m=3 sketch with Lemma M3 and a worked example, insert the period-lifting lemma and boundary tests into output.md, and update the “Next targets” to drop the impossible constant-increment rigidity in favor of periodic-Δ classification. Sources: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json, prover-03.out.json (Round 0005). Verifier: partial success (some higher-m/further rigidity issues remain).",

    "Component-length obstruction: If E+δ = S^1\\E a.e. then the multiset of component lengths L(E) equals the multiset of gap lengths G(E). This closes the remaining non-column step in Theorem A for |J_0|=1/2.",
    "Correct m=3 Fourier obstruction (Lemma M3): If \u007f1_E(t) and \u007f1_E(3t) are nonzero for some t, then S^1 cannot be tiled a.e. by three translates of E (replaces the earlier incorrect cube-root-of-unity sketch).",
    "Periodicity ⇔ periodic increments (period-lifting): In the singleton complementary two-layer regime, T has period (r, α_*) iff Δ_{n+r}=Δ_n for all n, with α_* = rα + Σ_{j=1}^r Δ_j. Nonperiodic Δ produce aperiodic irreducible tilings (explicit for q=2).",
    "No single-row columns / component-size bound: If K has min and max heights k_min<k_max then no column can be a single row; any finite connected column component has length ≥ (k_max−k_min)+1.",
    "Two-sided boundary rational-independence test (corollary of Lemma E): boundary aggregated measures μ_min, μ_max must satisfy μ_min/μ_max ∈ Q for a finite column; irrational ratio forbids columns (useful for K={0,1,2}).",
    "Bookkeeping fixes: remove duplicate Lemma E, correct modulus arithmetic in Lemma T's final congruences, and append the Prop. H remark that choosing β with s/β ∉ Q ensures the incommensurability clause."

    "Replace the incorrect m=3 sketch in output.md with Lemma M3 and include a concrete worked example (e.g. an |E|=1/3 union of intervals with \u007f1_E(1), \u007f1_E(3) ≠ 0) to certify the anti-3-tiling hypothesis.",
    "Insert the period-lifting lemma (periodicity ⇔ periodic Δ) into Proposition K, add the corollary that nonperiodic Δ give aperiodic singleton tilings, and update the document's “Next targets” to remove the constant-increment goal in favor of classifying periodic-Δ tilings.",
    "Tackle the remaining rigidity/obstruction problems beyond m=3: either strengthen Fourier multi-frequency certificates for m≥4 or develop alternative combinatorial/algebraic constraints (unit-modulus sum lemmas or propagation arguments) that can force rigidity when needed."
