Global assessment: The three reports are strong and largely compatible. They correct a genuine error in the m=3 Fourier sketch, close a justification gap in Theorem A’s non-column proof via a clean combinatorial invariant, and add compact structural lemmas (periodicity from periodic increments; boundary rational-independence test; minimal component length for columns). These are small but meaningful increments that improve rigor and streamline arguments.

Key correctness points and fixes:
- m=3 Fourier obstruction: Report 02 correctly points out the earlier t and 2t sketch was wrong (cube roots satisfy both). Their Lemma M3 (use t and 3t) is correct and sharp: from 1 = Σ 1_{E+δ_j} one gets Σ x_j = 0 for x_j = e^{2πitδ_j} whenever \hat{1_E}(t) ≠ 0. If also \hat{1_E}(3t) ≠ 0, Newton’s identity yields Σ x_j^3 = 3x_1x_2x_3 ≠ 0, contradiction. We will add this lemma to output.md and remove any reliance on the flawed t/2t sketch.
- Lemma T modulus wording: Both 02 and 03 caught the minor slip. The contradiction should be stated in congruence form: e^{2πitδ} = −1 ⇒ tδ ≡ 1/2 (mod 1). For t=2, δ ≡ 1/4 (mod 1/2); for t=4, δ ≡ 1/8 (mod 1/4), incompatible. We’ll fix this in output.md.
- Component-length obstruction: Report 01’s lemma is correct and precisely what was implicitly used in Theorem A(iii). We add it to output.md and explicitly cite it in the proof of (iii), making that step Fourier-free and fully formal.
- Periodicity from periodic increments: Reports 01/02/03 propose equivalent formulations. We include a polished Lemma P (iff) in output.md immediately after Proposition K; this both corrects the previously over-ambitious “constant increment” target and cleanly classifies periodic singleton tilings produced by the complementary construction.
- Boundary tools and columns: We remove the duplicate placeholder “Lemma E [As before]” and keep the explicit statement. We add (i) the two-sided rational-independence corollary (μ_{k_min}/μ_{k_max} ∉ Q forbids columns) and (ii) the minimal-component-length lemma: any finite column component must have length ≥ (k_max − k_min) + 1; in particular no single-row column exists if the tile spans multiple heights. Both are correct and useful.
- Proposition H incommensurability clause: We include the remark that s/β ∉ Q ⇒ β/(β − s) ∉ Q (Lemma Q), allowing incommensurability without assuming s ∈ Q by a suitable choice of β.

Triage/value:
- Keep: Lemma M3 (m=3 Fourier), component-length obstruction, periodicity⇔periodic increments (Lemma P), boundary ratio test, minimal component length. These are robust and broadly useful.
- Housekeeping: Remove duplicate Lemma E; fix Lemma T; make Proposition G self-contained (short proof added); keep stabilizer symmetry as a small lemma.
- Defer: General rigidity for q≥3 (constant increments) is false in general (Proposition K shows meanders). Frame the correct target as “classification of periodic tilings via periodic increments.”

Next steps for provers:
- Fourier beyond m=3: For m≥4, Σ x_j = 0 together with a few higher power sums p_k = Σ x_j^k = 0 (for k in a set where \hat{1_E}(k t) ≠ 0) can be combined via Newton’s identities to force contradictions. Seek E with a prescribed nonvanishing spectrum at k ∈ {1,2,3,…} that makes the system inconsistent for the desired m.
- Explicit |E|=1/3 examples: Construct E with \hat{1_E}(t), \hat{1_E}(3t) ≠ 0 (e.g., small unions of arcs) and apply Lemma M3 to feed Proposition K2 (anti-m-tiling hypothesis) to force singleton tilings.
- K={0,1,2} and beyond: Use the minimal component-length lemma + Lemma E to rule out columns systematically; enumerate fixed orders (via Lemma C) and search for multi-order coexistence; combine with Lemma P to list all periodic tilings (period and slope) arising.
- Stabilizer control: For complementary constructions with Stab(J_0)=(1/q)Z, explore additional structural hypotheses that might force the increments to be eventually periodic (e.g., endpoint propagation constraints), yielding classification of all periodic solutions.
