  "feedback_md": "Global assessment: The three reports are strong and largely compatible. They correct a genuine error in the m=3 Fourier sketch, close a justification gap in Theorem A\u2019s non-column proof via a clean combinatorial invariant, and add compact structural lemmas (periodicity from periodic increments; boundary rational-independence test; minimal component length for columns). These are small but meaningful increments that improve rigor and streamline arguments.\n\nKey correctness points and fixes:\n- m=3 Fourier obstruction: Report 02 correctly points out the earlier t and 2t sketch was wrong (cube roots satisfy both). Their Lemma M3 (use t and 3t) is correct and sharp: from 1 = \u03a3 1_{E+\u03b4_j} one gets \u03a3 x_j = 0 for x_j = e^{2\u03c0it\u03b4_j} whenever \\hat{1_E}(t) \u2260 0. If also \\hat{1_E}(3t) \u2260 0, Newton\u2019s identity yields \u03a3 x_j^3 = 3x_1x_2x_3 \u2260 0, contradiction. We will add this lemma to output.md and remove any reliance on the flawed t/2t sketch.\n- Lemma T modulus wording: Both 02 and 03 caught the minor slip. The contradiction should be stated in congruence form: e^{2\u03c0it\u03b4} = \u22121 \u21d2 t\u03b4 \u2261 1/2 (mod 1). For t=2, \u03b4 \u2261 1/4 (mod 1/2); for t=4, \u03b4 \u2261 1/8 (mod 1/4), incompatible. We\u2019ll fix this in output.md.\n- Component-length obstruction: Report 01\u2019s lemma is correct and precisely what was implicitly used in Theorem A(iii). We add it to output.md and explicitly cite it in the proof of (iii), making that step Fourier-free and fully formal.\n- Periodicity from periodic increments: Reports 01/02/03 propose equivalent formulations. We include a polished Lemma P (iff) in output.md immediately after Proposition K; this both corrects the previously over-ambitious \u201cconstant increment\u201d target and cleanly classifies periodic singleton tilings produced by the complementary construction.\n- Boundary tools and columns: We remove the duplicate placeholder \u201cLemma E [As before]\u201d and keep the explicit statement. We add (i) the two-sided rational-independence corollary (\u03bc_{k_min}/\u03bc_{k_max} \u2209 Q forbids columns) and (ii) the minimal-component-length lemma: any finite column component must have length \u2265 (k_max \u2212 k_min) + 1; in particular no single-row column exists if the tile spans multiple heights. Both are correct and useful.\n- Proposition H incommensurability clause: We include the remark that s/\u03b2 \u2209 Q \u21d2 \u03b2/(\u03b2 \u2212 s) \u2209 Q (Lemma Q), allowing incommensurability without assuming s \u2208 Q by a suitable choice of \u03b2.\n\nTriage/value:\n- Keep: Lemma M3 (m=3 Fourier), component-length obstruction, periodicity\u21d4periodic increments (Lemma P), boundary ratio test, minimal component length. These are robust and broadly useful.\n- Housekeeping: Remove duplicate Lemma E; fix Lemma T; make Proposition G self-contained (short proof added); keep stabilizer symmetry as a small lemma.\n- Defer: General rigidity for q\u22653 (constant increments) is false in general (Proposition K shows meanders). Frame the correct target as \u201cclassification of periodic tilings via periodic increments.\u201d\n\nNext steps for provers:\n- Fourier beyond m=3: For m\u22654, \u03a3 x_j = 0 together with a few higher power sums p_k = \u03a3 x_j^k = 0 (for k in a set where \\hat{1_E}(k t) \u2260 0) can be combined via Newton\u2019s identities to force contradictions. Seek E with a prescribed nonvanishing spectrum at k \u2208 {1,2,3,\u2026} that makes the system inconsistent for the desired m.\n- Explicit |E|=1/3 examples: Construct E with \\hat{1_E}(t), \\hat{1_E}(3t) \u2260 0 (e.g., small unions of arcs) and apply Lemma M3 to feed Proposition K2 (anti-m-tiling hypothesis) to force singleton tilings.\n- K={0,1,2} and beyond: Use the minimal component-length lemma + Lemma E to rule out columns systematically; enumerate fixed orders (via Lemma C) and search for multi-order coexistence; combine with Lemma P to list all periodic tilings (period and slope) arising.\n- Stabilizer control: For complementary constructions with Stab(J_0)=(1/q)Z, explore additional structural hypotheses that might force the increments to be eventually periodic (e.g., endpoint propagation constraints), yielding classification of all periodic solutions.\n",
  "new_notes_md": "New tools and corrections (Round 0005)\n\n1) Component-length obstruction to complementary translation\n- Lemma. Let E \u2282 S^1 be a finite union of closed intervals with disjoint interiors. Write L(E) for the multiset of component lengths of E, and G(E) for the multiset of cyclic gap lengths between consecutive endpoints of E. If E+\u03b4 = S^1\\E a.e. for some \u03b4, then L(E) = G(E) as multisets. Thus L(E) \u2260 G(E) forbids such a \u03b4.\n- Use in Theorem A(iii). For J_0=U \u222a (U+1/2) with a suitable U (e.g., U=[0,0.2) \u222a [0.3,0.35)), we have L(J_0) \u2260 G(J_0), hence no two-translate complement exists. This closes the non-column step without Fourier.\n\n2) Fourier obstruction for 3 translates (fix of the earlier sketch)\n- Lemma M3. If S^1 is a.e. the disjoint union of three translates E+\u03b4_1, E+\u03b4_2, E+\u03b4_3, then for every t\u22600 with \\hat{1_E}(t)\u22600 we have \u03a3_{j=1}^3 e^{2\u03c0it\u03b4_j}=0. In particular, if \\hat{1_E}(t) and \\hat{1_E}(3t) are both nonzero, no such 3-translate tiling exists.\n- Proof idea. Let x_j:=e^{2\u03c0it\u03b4_j}. From the partition, for t\u22600 we have (\u03a3 x_j) \\hat{1_E}(t)=0 \u21d2 \u03a3 x_j=0. If also \\hat{1_E}(3t)\u22600 then \u03a3 x_j^3=0. Newton\u2019s identity for three variables gives \u03a3 x_j^3 = 3x_1x_2x_3, impossible since |x_j|=1.\n\n3) Periodicity of singleton complementary tilings \u21d4 periodicity of increments\n- Lemma P. In the complementary construction with singleton rows, write \u0394_n:=\u03b8_n\u2212\u03b8_{n\u22121}\u2212\u03b1 \u2208 Stab(J_0) (Proposition K).

In particular, aperiodic (\u0394_n) yield aperiodic tilings; r-periodic (\u0394_n) yield period (r, \u03b1_*).\n\n4) Two-sided boundary obstruction by rational independence (quick non-column test)\n- Corollary (to Lemma E). With k_min:=min K, k_max:=max K, if A+T=X\u00d7S^1 with X finite, then \u03bc_{k_min} d_{p\u2212k_min}=1 and \u03bc_{k_max} d_{q\u2212k_max}=1 at the left/right boundaries. Therefore \u03bc_{k_min}/\u03bc_{k_max} \u2208 Q. If this ratio is irrational, A cannot be a column.\n\n5) Minimal component length for finite columns; no single-row columns when k_min<k_max\n- Lemma. If K spans at least two heights (k_min<k_max) and A+T=X\u00d7S^1 is a finite-column tiling with a connected component [p,q]\u2282X, then q\u2212p+1 \u2265 (k_max\u2212k_min)+1. In particular, no single-row column exists. Equivalently, anchors contributing to a boundary row necessarily force coverage extending by \u2265k_max\u2212k_min rows.\n\n6) Stabilizer symmetry\n- Lemma. Stab(E)=Stab(S^1\\E)=Stab(E+\u03b1) a.e.

This underlies the symmetric steps in K2 and the complementary construction.\n\n7) Corrections and housekeeping\n- Lemma T (Fourier two-translate) contradiction should be stated as congruences: e^{2\u03c0it\u03b4}=\u22121 \u21d2 t\u03b4 \u2261 1/2 (mod 1). For t=2, \u03b4 \u2261 1/4 (mod 1/2); for t=4, \u03b4 \u2261 1/8 (mod 1/4), incompatible.\n- Remove duplicate placeholder for Lemma E in output.md; keep only the explicit statement with proof.\n- Proposition H remark.

  "new_outputs_md": "Summary of proven results and why they matter\n- Main existence theorem (Theorem A). We construct an explicit non-column tile A \u2282 Z\u00d7S^1 that admits two irreducible tilings with incommensurable vertical periods (1,\u03b1) and (1,\u03b1+1/2), \u03b1 irrational.\n- Boundary and structural tools. We record a precise boundary obstruction (Lemma E), a two-sided rational-independence corollary, and a minimal component-length lemma for finite columns. Together these provide quick non-column tests across many K.\n- Fourier obstructions. We include a corrected and robust two-translate obstruction (Lemma T) and a new m=3 obstruction (Lemma M3) based on t and 3t, which replaces an earlier incorrect sketch.\n- Complementary two-layer family: meanders and periods. Singleton tilings are classified by per-row increments in Stab(J_0) (Proposition K). We add a precise equivalence (Lemma P) between periodicity of increments and periodicity of the tiling, subsuming the helical cases and exhibiting many aperiodic examples when Stab(J_0)\u2260{0}.\n- Two-order mechanism for K={0,1,2}. When c_1=c_3, a single tile admits two distinct singleton tilings corresponding to the two cyclic orders; non-columnity follows from boundary obstructions; incommensurability holds under a mild irrationality condition (Lemma Q).\n\nTheorem A (Non-column tile with two incommensurable periods). Fix an irrational \u03b1\u2208(0,1/2). Let U\u2282S^1 be a finite union of disjoint intervals of total length 1/4 such that U\u2229(U+1/2)=\u2205 and L(U)\u2260G(U) inside [0,1/2), where L(\u00b7),G(\u00b7) are the multisets of component and gap lengths. Define J_0:=U\u222a(U+1/2) (so |J_0|=1/2 and J_0+1/2=J_0), J_1:=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1), and set A:=( {0}\u00d7J_0 ) \u222a ( {1}\u00d7J_1 ). Then:\n(i) There is a tiling T_\u03b1 with period (1,\u03b1), and a tiling T_{\u03b1+1/2} with period (1,\u03b1+1/2).\n(ii) Both tilings are irreducible.\n(iii) A is not a column (i.e., there is no finite X\u2282Z and T\u2282Z\u00d7S^1 with A+T=X\u00d7S^1).\n(iv) The periods are incommensurable: \u03b1/(\u03b1+1/2)\u2209Q.\nProof. (i) For \u03b8_0 arbitrary, T_\u03b1={(n,\u03b8_0+n\u03b1)} yields on row n the union (J_0+\u03b8_n) \u2294 (J_1+\u03b8_{n\u22121}) with \u03b8_n=\u03b8_0+n\u03b1; since J_1=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1), this is S^1 a.e. Using J_0+1/2=J_0, the same argument gives T_{\u03b1+1/2}. (ii) Singleton-per-row implies irreducible because \u27e8K\u2212K\u27e9=Z (Lemma B). (iii) Suppose A+T=X\u00d7S^1 with X finite. At the left boundary row p of a component of X the per-row disjointness forces a two-translate partition of S^1 by J_0 alone; by the component-length obstruction lemma (Lemma CL below) applied to J_0, this is impossible. (iv) If \u03b1/(\u03b1+1/2)=p/q\u2208Q, then \u03b1=p/(2(q\u2212p))\u2208Q, contradiction. \u220e\n\nLemma B (Irreducibility for singleton tilings with gcd(K\u2212K)=1). Let A have layers at K={k_1,\u2026,k_\u2113} and suppose |T_n|=1 for all n. Let H:=\u27e8K\u2212K\u27e9\u2264Z. If H=Z then any tiling is irreducible.\nProof. If T=T_1\u2294T_2 with A+T_i=X_i\u00d7S^1 and Z=X_1\u2294X_2, then from m\u2208X_1 we deduce m\u2212k_i\u2208X_1 for all i, so X_1 is a union of cosets of H. If H=Z, only \u2205 and Z can occur. \u220e\n\nLemma B\u2032 (Reducibility when gcd(K\u2212K)>1). If H:=\u27e8K\u2212K\u27e9 has index g>1, decompose T by residues mod g: T^{(r)}:={ (z,\u03b8)\u2208T : z\u2261r (mod g) }. Then A+T^{(r)}=X_r\u00d7S^1 with X_r:=gZ+r, so the tiling splits along residue classes. \u220e\n\nLemma C (Singleton congruences under a fixed cyclic order: necessity and sufficiency). Assume |T_n|=1 and that on every row the \u2113 intervals appear in the same cyclic order \u03c3 and meet end-to-end. Let c_i:=b_i\u2212a_i and \u03b2:=\u03b8_n\u2212\u03b8_{n\u22121} (mod 1).

Let A=\u22c3_i {k_i}\u00d7[a_i,b_i] and, for each height k, let the aggregated layer be J_k:=\u22c3_{i: k_i=k}[a_i,b_i] with \u03bc_k:=|J_k|. Suppose A+T=X\u00d7S^1 with X finite, and write d_n:=|T_n|.

If there exists \u03b4 with E+\u03b4 = S^1\\E a.e., then for every t\u2208Z\\{0} with \\hat{1_E}(t)\u22600 we have e^{2\u03c0it\u03b4}=\u22121, i.e. t\u03b4 \u2261 1/2 (mod 1). In particular, if \\hat{1_E}(2), \\hat{1_E}(4) \u2260 0, no such \u03b4 can exist because \u03b4 \u2261 1/4 (mod 1/2) and \u03b4 \u2261 1/8 (mod 1/4) are incompatible. \u220e\n\nLemma CL (Component-length obstruction). Let E\u2282S^1 be a finite union of closed intervals with disjoint interiors, with component-length multiset L(E) and gap-length multiset G(E). If E+\u03b4 = S^1\\E a.e. for some \u03b4, then L(E)=G(E) as multisets. Hence L(E)\u2260G(E) forbids a two-translate complement. \u220e\n\nLemma M3 (Fourier obstruction to 3-translate tilings). If S^1 is a.e. the disjoint union of three translates E+\u03b4_1,E+\u03b4_2,E+\u03b4_3, then for every t\u22600 with \\hat{1_E}(t)\u22600 one has \u03a3_{j=1}^3 e^{2\u03c0it\u03b4_j}=0. In particular, if there exists t with \\hat{1_E}(t), \\hat{1_E}(3t) \u2260 0, then no such 3-translate tiling exists.\nProof. Let x_j:=e^{2\u03c0it\u03b4_j}. The partition identity gives (\u03a3 x_j) \\hat{1_E}(t)=0 for t\u22600. If \\hat{1_E}(t)\u22600, then \u03a3 x_j=0. If also \\hat{1_E}(3t)\u22600, then \u03a3 x_j^3=0. Newton\u2019s identity p_3 = e_1 p_2 \u2212 e_2 p_1 + 3e_3 with e_1=\u03a3 x_j=0 and p_1=\u03a3 x_j=0 gives \u03a3 x_j^3 = 3x_1x_2x_3 \u2260 0, contradiction. \u220e\n\nCorollary E\u2032 (Two-sided boundary rational-independence test). In the setting of Lemma E, \u03bc_{k_min}\u00b7d_{p\u2212k_min}=1 and \u03bc_{k_max}\u00b7d_{q\u2212k_max}=1 force \u03bc_{k_min}/\u03bc_{k_max}\u2208Q. Hence if \u03bc_{k_min}/\u03bc_{k_max}\u2209Q, A is not a column. \u220e\n\nLemma N (Minimal component length for finite columns; no single-row columns). Let K have k_min<k_max. If A+T=X\u00d7S^1 with X finite and [p,q] is a connected component of X, then q\u2212p+1 \u2265 (k_max\u2212k_min)+1. In particular, no single-row column exists.\nProof. Any anchor (z,\u03b8) contributes to rows z+k, k\u2208K. To avoid coverage outside [p,q], one must have z\u2208[p\u2212k_min, q\u2212k_max]. Coverage of row p requires anchors with z=p\u2212k for some k\u2208K; the only such z in [p\u2212k_min, q\u2212k_max] is z=p\u2212k_min. Similarly, coverage of row q requires z=q\u2212k_max. Existence of both requires p\u2212k_min \u2264 q\u2212k_max, i.e. q\u2212p \u2265 k_max\u2212k_min. \u220e\n\nProposition S (Singleton rigidity via integrality exclusion for complementary two-layer tiles). Let A=({0}\u00d7J_0)\u222a({1}\u00d7J_1) with J_1=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1). If either 1/|J_0|\u2209N or 1/|J_1|\u2209N, then every tiling satisfies |T_n|=1. Proof as before. \u220e\n\nProposition G (q-phase generalization of the complementary 2-layer construction). If J_0\u2282S^1 satisfies J_0+1/q=J_0 and J_1:=S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1) with \u03b1 irrational, then for each j=0,1,\u2026,q\u22121 the singleton set T_{\u03b1+j/q}:={(n,\u03b8_0+n(\u03b1+j/q))} is a tiling with period (1,\u03b1+j/q). For j\u2260j\u2032, the periods are incommensurable (Lemma R). If |J_0|\u2209{1/m}, then A is not a column (Lemma E).\nProof. As in Theorem A(i). Incommensurability: apply Lemma R with a=j/q, b=j\u2032/q. The boundary conclusion follows from Lemma E at the two extremes. \u220e\n\nProposition H (K={0,1,2} two-order mechanism). Let K=(0,1,2) and c_i=b_i\u2212a_i>0 with c_1+c_2+c_3=1. If c_1=c_3=s\u2209{1/m}, there exist endpoints and an irrational slope \u03b2 such that A admits two distinct singleton tilings with orders (1\u21922\u21923\u21921) and (1\u21923\u21922\u21921), slopes \u03b2 and \u03b2\u2032\u2261\u03b2\u2212s (mod 1), respectively. Both are irreducible; A is not a column. If s\u2208Q and \u03b2\u2209Q, the periods are incommensurable.
