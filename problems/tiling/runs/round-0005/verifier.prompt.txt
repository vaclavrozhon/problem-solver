You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md and output.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers
- notes.md (summary so far)
- output.md (rigorously proven results so far)

Guidelines:
- notes.md: should be a readable running log of interesting work. Prefer appending. Replace only if old notes are clearly misleading. Remember -- notes should be self-contained and should make sense even without seeing outputs of past provers. 
- output.md:  Think twice before you add something to this file. Everything here should be rigorous, almost publication-ready. It should contain only fully proven theorems that are clearly an interesting step towards the solution (or the solution itself). The beginning of the file is a clear list of interesting theorems you can prove, together with a discussion about why it is relevant. From the statement of the theorem it has to be clear that this constitutes nontrivial progress towards solution. The rest of the file contains a fully rigorous list of the proofs of the theorems. Keep only proven theorems with clear proofs. If a statement in that file is flawed / unprecise and you cannot fix it on the spot, remove it from output.md and instead add it to notes.md with explanation.
- Be careful with the booleans `new_notes_append` and `new_outputs_append`: default is True (append). Use False only when deliberately rewriting everything.

Tasks:
1) Audit rigor: identify unjustified steps, false statements, missing lemmas; produce minimal counterexamples.
2) Triage value: separate genuine progress from noise.
3) Guide next steps: propose what provers should try next.

**Verdict definitions**:
- **success**: Something that one could publish, even if it is not the full solution (e.g., significant theorem, key lemma, novel technique, partial solution with clear path forward)
- **partial success**: Something worthy enough to write into output.md (e.g., correct but preliminary results, useful technical lemmas, validated approaches that advance understanding)
- **nothing so far**: No meaningful mathematical progress or only exploratory work

[{"prover_id": "01", "progress_md": "Round 0005 \u2014 audit, formalizations, and small structural lemmas\n\nAudit of output.md (gaps, clarifications, corrections)\n- Meandering vs \u201cconstant increment\u201d rigidity. Output now correctly includes Proposition K (any singleton tiling in the complementary two-layer construction is parameterized by arbitrary increments \u0394_n\u2208Stab(J_0)). However, two places still list as a \u201cnext target\u201d to prove that \u03b8_m\u2212\u03b8_{m\u22121}\u2212\u03b1 is constant modulo 1/q. This goal contradicts Proposition K unless one restricts to periodic tilings (or imposed extra structure). Suggest replacing that target with \u201cclassify periodic tilings: \u0394_n periodic \u21d2 a period (r, r\u03b1+\u2211_{j=1}^r\u0394_j).\u201d I give the precise statement and proof below.\n- Theorem A non-column step (component-length obstruction). The current text invokes a component-length mismatch but does not state the necessary lemma explicitly. I provide a short, clean lemma (\u201ccomponent-length obstruction\u201d) that justifies this step for any finite union of intervals E\u2282S^1: if the multiset of component lengths of E differs from the multiset of gap lengths, then no translate of E can equal its complement a.e. This closes the only missing justification in (iii) for |J_0|=1/2.\n- Proposition H (incommensurability clause). The statement assumes s rational; output later records Lemma Q (s/\u03b2\u2209Q \u21d2 \u03b2/(\u03b2\u2212s)\u2209Q). I recommend adding to Prop. H a remark that one can ensure incommensurability for arbitrary s by choosing \u03b2 with s/\u03b2\u2209Q.\n- Boundary tool. The explicit aggregated-measure Lemma E is now present (good). I add a small corollary (below) ruling out \u201csingle-row columns\u201d whenever k_min<k_max; this can be cited for K={0,1,2} as a quick structural check.\n\nNew lemmas and micro-results (auditable)\n\n1) Component-length obstruction to complementary translation\n- Lemma (component-length obstruction). Let E\u2282S^1 be a finite union of closed intervals with pairwise disjoint interiors. Write L(E) for the multiset of lengths of its connected components, and G(E) for the multiset of cyclic gap-lengths between consecutive endpoints of E. If there exists \u03b4 with E+\u03b4 = S^1\\E a.e., then L(E)=G(E) as multisets. In particular, if L(E)\u2260G(E), such \u03b4 cannot exist.\n- Proof. Translation preserves component lengths, so L(E+\u03b4)=L(E). The complement S^1\\E is exactly the disjoint union (up to endpoints) of the gaps between consecutive endpoints of E, so its component-length multiset is G(E). If E+\u03b4=S^1\\E a.e., then L(E)=L(E+\u03b4)=L(S^1\\E)=G(E).\n- Why useful here. This formalizes the non-column step in Theorem A when |J_0|=1/2: our chosen U ensures L(J_0)\u2260G(J_0), hence J_0 cannot be a complementary translate of itself, forbidding the 2-translate partition forced at the boundary.\n\n2) Periods from periodic increments in the meandering classification\n- Proposition (periodicity of T from periodic \u0394). In the setting of Proposition K (complementary two-layer, singleton-per-row), suppose the increments \u0394_n:=\u03b8_n\u2212\u03b8_{n\u22121}\u2212\u03b1 take values in Stab(J_0) and are periodic of period r, i.e., \u0394_{n+r}=\u0394_n for all n. Then T has period (r, \u03b1_r) with\n  \u03b1_r := r\u03b1 + \u2211_{j=1}^r \u0394_j  (in S^1).\n- Proof. From \u03b8_{n}\u2212\u03b8_{n\u22121}=\u03b1+\u0394_n, we have \u03b8_{n+r}\u2212\u03b8_n = r\u03b1 + \u2211_{j=1}^r \u0394_{n+j}. If \u0394 is r-periodic, the sum is independent of n and equals \u2211_{j=1}^r \u0394_j. Hence T_{n+r} = T_n + \u03b1_r for all n.\n- Why useful here. This replaces the (now incorrect) \u201cconstant increment\u201d rigidity target by a correct periodic-\u0394 classification of periodic tilings. As a corollary, the helical families in Theorem A and Prop. G correspond to r=1 with constant \u0394.\n\n3) No single-row column when the tile spans multiple heights\n- Lemma (no one-row columns if k_min<k_max). Let A=\u22c3_i {k_i}\u00d7[a_i,b_i] with k_min:=min{k_i}<k_max:=max{k_i}. Then there is no tiling A+T={p}\u00d7S^1 with a single row p. More generally, no connected component of a finite-column set X\u2282Z can have size < (k_max\u2212k_min)+1.\n- Proof (single-row case). If A+T={p}\u00d7S^1, any anchor (z,\u03b8) that contributes to row p via some height k\u2032 (i.e., z+k\u2032=p) also produces contributions at rows z+k for all k\u2208{k_i}. Since k_max>k\u2032, the same anchor contributes to row p+(k_max\u2212k\u2032) > p, contradicting A+T\u2282{p}\u00d7S^1. The general bound follows by the same argument applied at both ends of a connected component [p,q]: any anchor contributing to the left endpoint generates coverage extending at least k_max\u2212k_min rows to the right, hence the component must have length \u2265 (k_max\u2212k_min)+1.\n- Why useful here. This gives an immediate structural constraint on prospective columns and can be combined with the boundary integrality (Lemma E) to streamline non-column checks for multi-height tiles (e.g., K={0,1,2}).\n\n4) Quick corollary for K={0,1,2}\n- Corollary. For K={0,1,2}, any finite column component X\u2229[p,q] must satisfy q\u2212p\u22652. At the left boundary c_1 d_p=1 and at the right boundary c_3 d_{q\u22122}=1, hence 1/c_1,1/c_3\u2208N. If c_1/c_3\u2209Q, this is impossible; thus A is not a column. (This complements Lemma E\u2019s \u201cnot a reciprocal\u201d test.)\n\nExamples and sanity checks\n- Theorem A (|J_0|=1/2). With U=[0,0.2]\u222a[0.3,0.35], L(J_0)={0.2,0.05,0.2,0.05}, while G(J_0)={0.1,0.15,0.1,0.15}; Lemma (component-length obstruction) forbids J_0+\u03b4=S^1\\J_0. Combined with the boundary argument, (iii) follows. (Fourier Lemma T gives an alternative certificate.)\n- Periodic \u0394 example. In the complementary construction with J_0+1/2=J_0, let \u0394_n alternate between 0 and 1/2. Then r=2 and \u03b1_2=2\u03b1+1/2, so T has period (2, 2\u03b1+1/2). This exhibits a third periodic tiling (beyond T_\u03b1 and T_{\u03b1+1/2}) for the same tile, consistent with Proposition K.\n\nWhy these help the program\n- The component-length lemma closes a justification gap in Theorem A\u2019s non-column proof for |J_0|=1/2 using a minimal, checkable combinatorial invariant.\n- The periodic-\u0394 proposition corrects and refines the \u201crigidity\u201d narrative: it identifies exactly when an arbitrary meandering singleton tiling is periodic, subsuming the helical cases.\n- The \u201cno single-row component\u201d lemma plus Lemma E yields easy, general non-column criteria (and prohibits tiny components) for multi-height tiles like K={0,1,2}.\n\nObstacles and cautions\n- m=3 Fourier obstruction. We still have only a sketch for \u201cno 3-translate partition\u201d based on two nonzero modes; a full proof requires a short algebraic lemma on unit-modulus sums (I will write it out next). Until then, use Lemma T (m=2) and integrality exclusions (Prop. S) to certify singleton rigidity.\n- Endpoint choices remain a.e.; all statements are robust under null perturbations (as recorded in the endpoint remark).\n\nActionable next steps for output.md\n- Add the component-length obstruction lemma immediately after the Fourier Lemma T and cite it in Theorem A(iii). This makes that step fully formal without Fourier.\n- Insert the periodic-\u0394 proposition as a corollary to Proposition K (\u201cclassification of periodic singleton tilings\u201d); update the \u201cNext targets\u201d to reflect this correct structure (drop the constant-increment aim).\n- Add the \u201cno single-row component\u201d lemma as a corollary of Lemma E (or as a separate observation) and reference it in the K={0,1,2} discussion.\n- In Proposition H, append a remark: incommensurability also holds whenever s/\u03b2\u2209Q (Lemma Q), allowing arbitrary s by appropriate \u03b2.\n\n"}, {"prover_id": "02", "progress_md": "Round 0005 \u2014 audit corrections, new Fourier obstruction (m=3), and two structural lemmas\n\nGaps and corrections in output.md (to fix explicitly)\n- Incorrect \u201cm=3 Fourier obstruction\u201d sketch. In \u201cFourier obstructions\u201d the sketch claims that requiring both \u2211 e^{2\u03c0 i t \u03b4_j}=0 and \u2211 e^{2\u03c0 i 2t \u03b4_j}=0 for three translates is impossible unless the \u03b4_j are (rotated) cube roots of unity, and then asserts this contradicts the second equation. This is not correct: if z_j are a rotated triple of cube roots of unity, then both sums at t and 2t vanish. So the stated sketch cannot be used as an obstruction.\n  \u2022 Corrected usable obstruction (see Lemma M3 below): for three translates, the simultaneous vanishing at frequencies t and 3t is impossible when both Fourier coefficients \\(\\hat{1_E}(t),\\hat{1_E}(3t)\\neq0\\). This should replace the current sketch.\n- Minor duplication. Lemma E appears first as \u201c[As before]\u201d and later as a full statement with proof. For coherence, keep only the explicit statement with proof and ensure earlier references point to it.\n- Minor precision in Lemma T\u2019s proof. It says \u201cfor t=2 and t=4 this would impose \u03b4\u22611/2 and \u03b4\u22611/4 simultaneously.\u201d The precise congruences are e^{4\u03c0 i \u03b4}=\u22121 \u21d2 \u03b4\u22611/4 (mod 1/2) and e^{8\u03c0 i \u03b4}=\u22121 \u21d2 \u03b4\u22611/8 (mod 1/4). The contradiction remains, but stating moduli avoids confusion.\n- Proposition H\u2019s incommensurability clause. The \u201cs rational\u201d hypothesis is sufficient but not necessary. Lemma Q already included shows an alternative: choose \u03b2 with s/\u03b2\u2209Q; then \u03b2/(\u03b2\u2212s)\u2209Q. It would be good to mention this option in the main body of Proposition H (not only in the \u201cAdditions\u201d section).\n\nNew small lemmas (auditable) to add\n1) Lemma M3 (Fourier obstruction to 3-translate tilings via t and 3t)\n- Statement. Let E\u2282S^1 be measurable. If S^1 is a.e. the disjoint union of three translates E+\u03b4_1,E+\u03b4_2,E+\u03b4_3, then for every t\u2208Z\\{0} with \\(\\hat{1_E}(t)\\neq0\\) one has \\(\\sum_{j=1}^3 e^{2\\pi i t\\,\\delta_j}=0\\). In particular, if there exists t with \\(\\hat{1_E}(t)\\neq0\\) and \\(\\hat{1_E}(3t)\\neq0\\), then no such 3-translate tiling exists.\n- Proof. The identity 1=\u2211_{j=1}^3 1_{E+\u03b4_j} a.e. gives, for t\u22600, \\(\\sum_j e^{2\\pi i t\\delta_j}\\,\\hat{1_E}(t)=0\\). If both \\(\\hat{1_E}(t),\\hat{1_E}(3t)\\neq0\\), then with x_j:=e^{2\\pi i t\\delta_j} we must have \\(\\sum_j x_j=0\\) and \\(\\sum_j x_j^3=0\\). By Newton\u2019s identity for three variables, \\(\\sum_j x_j^3 = 3 x_1 x_2 x_3\\). Since each x_j has unit modulus, the product is nonzero, so \\(\\sum_j x_j^3\\neq0\\), a contradiction. \u220e\n- Why useful here. This supplies a correct and sharp obstruction for m=3 (replacing the incorrect sketch). It lets us forbid 3-fold partitions for concrete E by checking two Fourier modes t and 3t.\n\n2) Lemma P (Periodicity of singleton complementary tilings \u21d4 periodicity of increments)\n- Setting. In the complementary two-layer construction A=({0}\u00d7J_0)\u222a({1}\u00d7(S^1\\(J_0+\u03b1))) assume the tiling is singleton-per-row, T_n={\u03b8_n}, and write increments \u0394_n:=\u03b8_n\u2212\u03b8_{n\u22121}\u2212\u03b1 \u2208 Stab(J_0) (Proposition K).\n- Claim. T has period (r,\u03b1_*) iff (i) \u0394_{n+r}=\u0394_n for all n (r-periodicity), and (ii) \\(\\alpha_* \\equiv r\\alpha + \\sum_{j=1}^r \\Delta_j\\) (mod 1).\n- Proof. T has period (r,\u03b1_*) iff \u03b8_{n+r}\u2212\u03b8_n is independent of n and equals \u03b1_* (mod 1). But \u03b8_{n+r}\u2212\u03b8_n = r\u03b1 + \u2211_{j=1}^r \u0394_{n+j}. Thus constancy in n is equivalent to \u0394_{n+r}\u2212\u0394_n=0 for all n (by taking successive differences of r-window sums), and the constant value equals r\u03b1+\u2211_{j=1}^r\u0394_j, yielding \u03b1_*. \u220e\n- Consequence. Choosing a nonperiodic sequence (\u0394_n)\u2208Stab(J_0)^Z produces an aperiodic (yet irreducible) tiling. For q=2 (Stab(J_0)={0,1/2}), any nonperiodic 0\u20131 sequence gives an aperiodic tiling.\n\n3) Lemma R\u2032 (Two-sided boundary obstruction via rational independence)\n- Statement. Let A be any tile with aggregated boundary measures \u03bc_{k_min}, \u03bc_{k_max} at the lowest and highest heights, respectively. If A tiles a finite set X\u00d7S^1, Lemma E forces \u03bc_{k_min}=1/d_L and \u03bc_{k_max}=1/d_R for some d_L,d_R\u2208N. Hence \u03bc_{k_min}/\u03bc_{k_max}=d_R/d_L\u2208Q. Therefore, if \u03bc_{k_min}/\u03bc_{k_max}\u2209Q, A cannot be a column.\n- Proof. Immediate from Lemma E\u2019s boundary equalities and d_L,d_R\u2208N. \u220e\n- Use. This strengthens easy non-column tests: for K={0,1,2} with one interval per layer, if c_1/c_3 is irrational then A is not a column, regardless of c_2.\n\nExamples and quick checks\n- Corrected Fourier m=3 certificate: Take E=U\u222a(U+1/3)\u222a(U+2/3) with U=[0,c) and choose c so that \\(\\hat{1_E}(1)\\neq0\\) and \\(\\hat{1_E}(3)\\neq0\\) (true for generic c). Then by Lemma M3, E cannot 3-tile S^1 by translations. This provides a clean \u201canti-3-tiling\u201d hypothesis to feed into Proposition K2 when |E|=1/3.\n- Aperiodic irreducible tilings in the complementary q=2 case: Let J_0 be as in Theorem A (for which singleton rigidity holds). Pick any nonperiodic bi-infinite sequence \u03b5_n\u2208{0,1} and put \u0394_n:=\u03b5_n\u00b7(1/2). Then T_n={\u03b8_0+n\u03b1+\u2211_{j=1}^n\u0394_j} defines a tiling by Proposition K. By Lemma P, T has no period (k,\u03b1_*). Irreducibility follows as in Lemma B (gcd(K\u2212K)=1).\n\nWhy useful here\n- Lemma M3 repairs and strengthens the Fourier toolkit for m=3, replacing an incorrect sketch and giving a crisp, checkable obstruction in a delicate case (|E|=1/3) that our boundary lemma alone does not exclude.\n- Lemma P formalizes the exact relationship between periods and increment sequences in the complementary construction. It both explains the source of many periods (constant increments) and guarantees the existence of aperiodic irreducible tilings when increments meander.\n- Lemma R\u2032 packages a very simple non-column test that only inspects the two boundary layers; it is immediately applicable to many K (including K={0,1,2}).\n\nObstacles and cautions\n- Fourier obstructions beyond m=2 and m=3. For m\u22654, requiring p_1=\u2211z_j=0 does not in general force p_m=\u2211z_j^m\u22600, so the t and mt strategy may not yield a contradiction. Stronger multi-frequency constraints (a set T of t\u2019s with \\(\\hat{1_E}(t)\\neq0\\)) or structural assumptions on E are likely needed.\n- Classification for q\u22653. Proposition K gives the meandering classification but does not force constant increments modulo 1/q. Proving rigidity (only the q helical tilings) seems to require an additional nondegeneracy hypothesis; current attempts via two- or three-row endpoint propagation have not yet yielded a contradiction when offsets vary.\n\nNext steps (concrete, testable updates to output.md)\n1) Replace the incorrect m=3 Fourier sketch by Lemma M3 (t and 3t obstruction) with its short proof. Optionally add a brief worked example class (E as a 1/3-periodic union of intervals with nonvanishing \\(\\hat{1_E}(1),\\hat{1_E}(3)\\)).\n2) Insert Lemma P (periodicity \u21d4 periodic increments) after Proposition K; add a one-line corollary: aperiodic increments produce aperiodic irreducible tilings.\n3) Add Lemma R\u2032 (boundary rational independence) to the \u201cBoundary tools\u201d and cite it in the K={0,1,2} section as an alternative non-column certificate when c_1/c_3\u2209Q.\n4) In Proposition H, append: \u201cAlternatively, incommensurability holds whenever s/\u03b2\u2209Q (Lemma Q), allowing arbitrary s by a suitable choice of \u03b2.\u201d\n5) Minor housekeeping: remove the first \u201c[As before]\u201d occurrence of Lemma E in favor of the explicit statement later, and refine the modulus wording in Lemma T\u2019s proof as noted above.\n\nThese are all incremental, auditable changes that close a correctness gap (m=3 Fourier), add two compact structural lemmas, and expand the stock of easy-to-verify non-column and aperiodicity criteria."}, {"prover_id": "03", "progress_md": "Round 0005 \u2014 audit, corrections, and small new lemmas/extensions\n\nAudit of output.md (what to fix or clarify)\n- Duplication of \u201cLemma E.\u201d The document contains two entries named \u201cLemma E\u201d: (i) a placeholder \u201c[As before.]\u201d in the main body and (ii) a fully stated and proved version in the \u201cAdditions, clarifications, and new tools\u201d section. For consistency and auditability, the placeholder should be removed or replaced by the explicit statement (the latter is already correct and sufficiently general via aggregated layers J_k with measures \u03bc_k).\n- Minor but real arithmetic slip in Lemma T (Fourier two-translate obstruction). The proof concludes \u201cfor t=2 and t=4 this would impose \u03b4\u22611/2 and \u03b4\u22611/4 simultaneously.\u201d The correct implication of e^{2\u03c0 i t \u03b4}=\u22121 is t\u03b4\u22611/2 (mod 1). Thus for t=2 one gets \u03b4\u22611/4 (mod 1/2), and for t=4 one gets \u03b4\u22611/8 (mod 1/4). These congruences have no common solution modulo 1, which is the intended contradiction. The fix is easy (replace \u03b4\u22611/2 by 2\u03b4\u22611/2, etc.).\n- Theorem A, proof of (iii). The line \u201c(iii) can also be deduced from Corollary F by instead choosing |J_0|\u2209{1/m}\u201d changes the data of the theorem (J_0 was fixed with |J_0|=1/2). This is fine as a variant but should be flagged as a separate remark (Theorem A\u2032). As written in the main proof, the non-column argument appeals to component-length mismatch; that is correct but it would help to cross-reference Lemma T as an alternate short certificate in the present example.\n- Proposition H (incommensurability clause). The statement assumes s rational. Since Lemma Q is now recorded, one can add: \u201cMore generally, incommensurability holds whenever s/\u03b2\u2209Q\u201d (choose \u03b2 accordingly). Suggest adding this as an inline remark after the current sentence to broaden applicability without changing the core proof.\n- \u201cAs before\u201d placeholders. Proposition G is referenced \u201cAs before.\u201d Given the short proof (phase transport plus J_0+1/q=J_0), I recommend inserting a brief proof sketch or an explicit reference to the earlier established argument so that output.md is self-contained.\n\nNew small lemmas/propositions (incremental, auditable)\n1) Period from periodic meanders (complementary two-layer, singleton regime)\n- Lemma (period-lifting). In Proposition K\u2019s setting (singleton, \u0394_n\u2208Stab(J_0)), if \u0394_n has period r and S:=\u2211_{j=1}^r \u0394_j, then T has period (r, r\u03b1+S): \u03b8_{n+r}\u2212\u03b8_n = r\u03b1+S for all n. Conversely, any choice of r and S\u2208r\u00b7Stab(J_0) is realizable by some periodic \u0394_n.\n- Proof. \u03b8_{n+r}\u2212\u03b8_n = \u2211_{j=1}^r(\u03b1+\u0394_{n+j}) = r\u03b1 + \u2211_{j=1}^r\u0394_{n+j} = r\u03b1+S by r-periodicity of \u0394. The converse is obtained by picking any r-periodic \u0394 with sum S.\n- Why useful here. Packages how meandering increments generate periods beyond the constant-increment (helical) case; helps enumerate all periodic tilings produced by a given J_0 (especially when Stab(J_0)=(1/q)Z).\n\n2) Two-sided boundary obstruction (quick non-column via rational independence)\n- Corollary (to Lemma E). With k_min:=min K and k_max:=max K, let \u03bc_{min}:=|J_{k_min}| and \u03bc_{max}:=|J_{k_max}|. If A tiles a finite X\u00d7S^1, then \u03bc_{min}d_{p\u2212k_min}=1 and \u03bc_{max}d_{q\u2212k_max}=1 at the leftmost and rightmost boundary rows p=min X, q=max X.

Set-up and notation
- Work in G = Z × S^1 (S^1 = R/Z). A tile A is a finite union of layers of the form {k_i}×[a_i,b_i] with 0 < b_i−a_i < 1, i=1,…,ℓ. A tiling T ⊂ Z×S^1 is a set of translations such that the (almost everywhere) disjoint union of A+(n,θ) over (n,θ)∈T equals Z×S^1. The fiber at n is T_n := {θ ∈ S^1 : (n,θ) ∈ T}. A period (k,α) means T+(k,α)=T.

Basic facts
- Fiber finiteness. In any tiling, every T_n is finite, and for each m we have ∑_i |T_{m−k_i}|·(b_i−a_i) = 1.
- Period transport. If (k,α) is a period then T_{n+k} = T_n + α for all n.

Singleton-per-row tilings
- Definition: |T_n|=1 for all n. Write T_n={θ_n}. Then column m is the (a.e.) disjoint union of the ℓ intervals [a_i+θ_{m−k_i}, b_i+θ_{m−k_i}], i=1,…,ℓ.
- Fixed cyclic order formulation. If, at each m, the ℓ intervals appear in the same cyclic order σ and meet end-to-end, then for some row phase φ_m one has θ_{m−k_i} = φ_m + c_i − a_i, where c_i are order-dependent constants with c_{σ(i)} ≡ c_i + (b_i−a_i) (mod 1). Consequently θ_{m−k_i} − θ_{m−k_j} is independent of m. If 1∈{k_i}, then θ_n−θ_{n−1} is constant, i.e. T has period (1,β) with β := θ_n−θ_{n−1}.
- Linear congruence system (Prover 03). Under a fixed order σ,
  (k_i − k_{σ(i)}) β ≡ a_i + (b_i−a_i) − a_{σ(i)}  (mod 1),  i=1,…,ℓ.
  For ℓ=3, K={0,1,2}, and orders σ=(1→2→3→1), σ'=(1→3→2→1), the two orders are simultaneously compatible for the same endpoints a_i iff c_1=c_3, and then the slopes satisfy β' ≡ β − c_1 (mod 1). This yields two distinct singleton tilings for the same tile when c_1=c_3.
- Irreducibility (singleton, gcd=1). Let H:=⟨K−K⟩≤Z. If H≠Z then any tiling splits along residue classes mod H; hence irreducibility forces H=Z. Moreover, if |T_n|=1 and H=Z then any partition T=T_1⊔T_2 induces Z=X_1⊔X_2 with X_1 closed under subtraction by each k_i and hence under ±(K−K); since H=Z, X_1 is either ∅ or Z. Thus singleton tilings with gcd(K−K)=1 are irreducible.

Two complementary-layer construction (explicit)
- Choose U⊂S^1 a finite union of disjoint intervals with |U|=1/4 and U∩(U+1/2)=∅ (e.g., U=[0,0.2)∪[0.3,0.35)). Let J_0:=U∪(U+1/2). Then |J_0|=1/2 and J_0+1/2=J_0. Pick an irrational α∈(0,1/2), and set J_1:=S^1\(J_0+α). Define A:=({0}×J_0)∪({1}×J_1).
- Two tilings. For any θ_0, define T_α={ (n, θ_0+nα): n∈Z }. On row n the contributions are (J_0+θ_n) and (J_1+θ_{n−1}) with θ_n=θ_0+nα, which are complementary because J_1=S^1\(J_0+α). Thus A+T_α=Z×S^1 a.e., and T_α has period (1,α). Using J_0+1/2=J_0 the same argument works for α' := α+1/2, giving a tiling T_{α'} with period (1,α'). Both are singleton tilings, hence irreducible by the lemma above (K={0,1} has gcd 1).
- Incommensurability. If α∉Q, then α/(α+1/2)∉Q: from α/(α+1/2)=p/q one deduces α=p/(2(q−p))∈Q, a contradiction.
- Non-column property (finite-column tilings impossible). Say A+T=X×S^1 with X finite. Let d_n:=|T_n|. On row n the union is a.e. disjoint, so |J_0| d_n + |J_1| d_{n−1} = 1_{n∈X}. With |J_0|=|J_1|=1/2 this yields d_n + d_{n−1} = 2·1_{n∈X}. Because X is finite, d_n=0 for all n sufficiently large/small. At the left boundary p of any connected component of X, we get d_{p−1}=0 and hence d_p=2; so row p is tiled by two disjoint translates of J_0 alone. Therefore S^1 is a.e. the disjoint union of two translates of J_0, which forces J_0+δ = S^1\J_0 for some δ. Our choice of U ensures this is impossible (the multiset of lengths of connected components of J_0 differs from that of its complement). Hence no such finite X exists: A is not a column.

Consequences
- This explicit A is a non-column tile that admits two irreducible periodic tilings with incommensurable vertical periods (1,α) and (1,α+1/2).
- Independently, for ℓ=3 and K={0,1,2} with c_1=c_3, the congruence mechanism produces two distinct singleton tilings of the same tile with slopes β and β'≡β−c_1. Picking β irrational makes β/(β') irrational unless a rational relation holds; such relations are at most countable in the parameter.

Next directions
- q-periodic generalization: If J_0 has 1/q-periodicity, the same complementary construction yields q tilings with slopes α+j/q; non-column persists under the same “no translational complement” obstruction.
- Non-column for K={0,1,2} singleton tiles: adapt the boundary-recurrence method with |J_•| = c_• to force a boundary row covered by a single layer, then forbid that layer from tiling S^1 by finitely many translates via a connected-component-length invariant.
Additional tools and extensions

1) Boundary obstruction to finite-column tilings (general form). For a tile A, define for each height k the aggregated layer J_k⊂S^1 as the union of all arcs at that height, and μ_k:=|J_k|. In any finite-column tiling A+T=X×S^1 with X finite and d_n:=|T_n|, the per-row measure identity is
  ∑_k μ_k · d_{m−k} = 1_{m∈X}, for all m∈Z.
If p:=min X and k_min:=min K, then only anchors with z=p−k_min can appear (any other anchor would create coverage outside X below p). Therefore d_{p−k_min} μ_{k_min}=1, so 1/μ_{k_min}∈N. Symmetrically, with q:=max X and k_max:=max K we get d_{q−k_max} μ_{k_max}=1, hence 1/μ_{k_max}∈N.

Consequences:
- K={0,1}: μ_{0}=|J_0|, μ_{1}=|J_1|. If |J_0|∉{1/m} then A is not a column. (This yields a very quick non-column test for two-layer tiles, including the complementary construction.)
- K={0,1,2}: If c_i denotes the total measure at height i (e.g., one interval per layer), then necessarily 1/c_1 and 1/c_3 are integers in any finite-column tiling. In particular, if c_1 or c_3 is not a reciprocal of an integer, the tile is not a column.

2) q-phase generalization of the complementary 2-layer construction. If J_0⊂S^1 is 1/q-periodic (J_0+1/q=J_0) and J_1:=S^1\(J_0+α) with α irrational, then for each j=0,1,…,q−1 the singleton set T_{α+j/q}:={(n,θ_0+n(α+j/q))} is a tiling with period (1,α+j/q). For j≠j′, the ratio (α+j/q)/(α+j′/q) cannot be rational (else α would be rational). If additionally |J_0|∉{1/m}, the boundary obstruction implies A is not a column. Irreducibility follows from the singleton-gcd criterion (K={0,1}).

3) Two-order singleton family for K={0,1,2} completed. When c_1=c_3=s, Lemma C shows the two cyclic orders (1→2→3→1) and (1→3→2→1) are simultaneously compatible and the slopes satisfy β′≡β−s (mod 1). If s∉{1/m}, the boundary obstruction rules out columns. If s is rational and β is irrational, then β/(β′) cannot be rational (else β would be rational), so the two periods are incommensurable.

4) Fourier alternative to translational complement. If E⊂S^1 satisfies E+δ = S^1\E a.e., then for all t≠0 with \hat{1_E}(t)≠0 we have e^{2π i t δ}=−1. In particular, if two distinct t’s have nonzero coefficients and cannot share a δ with e^{2π i t δ}=−1 simultaneously, such a δ cannot exist. This certifies non-columnity in cases like |J_0|=1/m when the boundary obstruction alone does not suffice.

Remark on endpoints. Complements produce open arcs; choosing closed representatives changes sets only on measure-zero boundaries and does not affect any of our tiling or measure identities.
Updates, corrections, and new tools

1) On the “complementary two-layer” structure A=({0}×J_0)∪({1}×J_1) with J_1=S^1\(J_0+α)
- Intersection identity. For any tiling A+T and row m, writing U_m:=⋃_{θ∈T_m}(J_0+θ) and V_m:=⋃_{θ∈T_{m−1}}(J_1+θ), we have U_m⊔V_m=S^1 a.e. and
  V_m = ⋃_{θ∈T_{m−1}} (S^1\(J_0+α+θ)) = S^1 \ ⋂_{θ∈T_{m−1}} (J_0+α+θ).
  Hence U_m = ⋂_{θ∈T_{m−1}} (J_0+α+θ) a.e. In particular, if d_{m−1}:=|T_{m−1}|≥1 then |U_m|≤|J_0|, which implies d_m≤1 (since U_m is a disjoint union of d_m translates of J_0). A symmetric statement holds one step forward: if d_m≥1 then d_{m+1}≤1.
- Degeneracy (0/2) is not excluded without extra hypotheses. For |J_0|=|J_1|=1/2, the per-row identity is d_m+d_{m−1}=2. The pattern (…,2,0,2,0,…) is compatible with this identity; ruling it out requires forbidding two-translate tilings of J_0 (and hence of J_1). Our Theorem A already enforces this (via component-length mismatch). Under this “no two-translate” hypothesis we can prove d_m=1 for all m (see new Proposition I in output.md).

2) Irreducibility and gcd(K−K)
- Necessity. If H:=⟨K−K⟩≠Z (say gcd g>1), any tiling splits along residue classes modulo g: for T^{(r)}:={ (z,θ)∈T : z≡r (mod g) } one has A+T^{(r)} = X_r×S^1 a.e. where X_r:=gZ+r, and the union over r is disjoint. Thus H=Z is necessary for irreducibility, not only in the singleton regime.
- Sufficiency in the singleton case. We include the full closure argument: if T=T_1⊔T_2 yields A+T_i=X_i×S^1, then from m∈X_1 all m−k_i∈X_1, hence X_1 is a union of cosets of H. If H=Z, X_1 is ∅ or Z.

3) Singleton with fixed cyclic order: equivalence (Lemma C)
- We now record the sufficiency half: if β and the a_i satisfy (k_i−k_{σ(i)})β≡a_i+c_i−a_{σ(i)} (mod 1), then θ_n:=θ_0+nβ produces, at each row m, ℓ arcs that meet end-to-end in the σ-order and (since ∑c_i=1) a.e. partition S^1.

4) Incommensurability tools
- General rational-shift test. If α∉Q and a≠b∈Q, then (α+a)/(α+b)∉Q. In particular, if α∉Q and r∈Q\{0}, then α/(α+r)∉Q. This packages the algebra used repeatedly in Theorem A and Prop. G.
- Caution (Prop. H). The statement “β/(β−s)∉Q for all s∈(0,1)” is false without assuming s∈Q; e.g., β=√2 and s=β/2 give β/(β−s)=2∈Q. We retain the hypothesis s rational in the incommensurability clause of Prop. H.

5) Fourier two-copy obstruction (record)
- If E+δ=S^1\E a.e., then for every t≠0 with \hat{1_E}(t)≠0 we have e^{2πitδ}=−1. This is useful to forbid two-translate tilings when |E|=1/2 (or more generally |E|=1/m), and underpins the “no two-translate” hypothesis.

6) Next targets (rigidity and classification)
- Under J_0 with only 1/q-translational invariance, prove that any complementary two-layer tiling must have constant increment θ_m−θ_{m−1} modulo 1/q; hence classify all tilings as the q helical ones from Prop. G. Strategy: use the intersection identity row-to-row and endpoint propagation to show that varying the 1/q offset produces overlaps.
- Systematically extend the multi-order mechanism beyond K={0,1,2}, again leveraging Lemma C and boundary obstruction Lemma E.
Additions and clarifications (Round 0004)

1) Clarification for Lemma C (singleton congruences)
- The necessity part implicitly uses that the increment β:=θ_n−θ_{n−1} is constant in n. This is guaranteed when 1∈K (as in K={0,1} and K={0,1,2} used here), or more generally when the fixed order across rows implies a helical structure. All our applications satisfy 1∈K.

2) Complementary two-layer: singleton tools
- Integrality-based singleton rigidity. For A=({0}×J_0)∪({1}×J_1) with J_1=S^1\(J_0+α), the per-row identity is |J_0| d_m + (1−|J_0|) d_{m−1}=1 and the intersection identity implies: if d_{m−1}≥1 then d_m≤1, and symmetrically. If either 1/|J_0|∉N or 1/(1−|J_0|)∉N then no d_m can be 0 (else we would force one of these reciprocals to be an integer), and the inequality forces d_m≤1. Thus d_m=1 for all m. This recovers singleton-per-row without the special |J_0|=1/2 case.
- Anti-m-tiling singleton rigidity (stronger hypothesis). If neither J_0 nor J_1 admits any m-fold partition of S^1 by disjoint translates for any m≥2, then d_m=1 for all m: if d_{m−1}≥2, then |U_m|<|J_0| so d_m=0, which forces an m-tile by J_1; contradiction. Symmetrically, d_{m−1}=0 would force an m-tile by J_0. Hence all d’s are 1.
- Meandering classification (singleton regime). Assuming d_m=1, the complementary structure forces J_0+θ_m = J_0+(α+θ_{m−1}) a.e., i.e. θ_m−θ_{m−1}−α ∈ Stab(J_0). Conversely, any sequence of increments in α+Stab(J_0) yields a valid singleton tiling. This exhibits many (often aperiodic) singleton tilings; helical ones are obtained by taking a constant offset.

3) Fourier obstructions
- Two-translate obstruction. If E+δ=S^1\E a.e., then for any t≠0 with \hat{1_E}(t)≠0 we have e^{2π i t δ}=−1. In particular, nonvanishing at two even modes (e.g., t=2 and t=4) forbids such δ since no δ can satisfy both e^{4π i δ}=−1 and e^{8π i δ}=−1 simultaneously.
- Worked class: if J_0=U∪(U+1/2) with U=[0,c) and c∉Q, then \hat{1_{J_0}}(2k)=2\hat{1_U}(2k) with \hat{1_U}(2k)=(e^{4π i k c}−1)/(4π i k)≠0 for all k≥1, so no two-translate complement exists. This gives an easy certification for many explicit choices of U (including variants of Theorem A when |J_0|≠1/2).
- Sketch for m=3 (to be formalized): If \hat{1_E}(t) and \hat{1_E}(2t) are nonzero and S^1 is partitioned a.e. by three translates of E, then the sums of first and second powers of e^{2π i t δ_j} vanish simultaneously, which is incompatible unless the three are cube roots of unity up to rotation; that in turn contradicts the second equation. This yields a quick “no 3-translate tiling” test.

4) Incommensurability algebra
- If s/β∉Q then β/(β−s)∉Q. Thus, in the K={0,1,2} two-order family, one can ensure incommensurability by choosing β so that s/β is irrational (no need to assume s rational).

5) Symmetry of two-translate complements
- E+δ=S^1\E a.e. iff (S^1\E)+δ=E a.e. Hence “no two-translate tiling” is symmetric under complement and translation. This justifies the symmetric step in the |J_0|=1/2 singleton rigidity proof.

6) Concrete directions
- Prove that when Stab(J_0)=(1/q)Z with no finer invariance, the offsets θ_m−θ_{m−1}−α (mod 1/q) must be constant across m; deduce that only the q helical tilings occur in that regime.
- Formalize the m=3 Fourier obstruction and apply it to explicit J_0 at |J_0|=1/3 to enforce the hypotheses of the anti-m-tiling singleton rigidity.
- For K={0,1,2,3}, enumerate fixed orders, write the congruence systems, and search for simultaneous compatibilities; combine with boundary integrality to certify non-columnity and extract ≥3 incommensurable periods.


Current output.md (if any):
Summary of proven results and why they matter
- Main existence theorem (Theorem A). We construct an explicit tile A⊂Z×S^1 that is not a column yet admits two irreducible tilings with periods (1,α) and (1,α+1/2), with α irrational; these two periods are incommensurable. This positively settles the core existence question.
- General structure for singleton tilings. We record a concise congruence system that characterizes singleton-per-row tilings with a fixed cyclic order, now with both necessity and sufficiency, and an irreducibility criterion. We also prove that gcd(K−K)=1 is not only sufficient (in the singleton setting) but that gcd(K−K)>1 forces reducibility in general.
- Complementary two-layer family: q-phase generalization. If J_0 has 1/q-periodicity, the complementary construction yields q singleton tilings with incommensurable vertical periods (1,α+j/q). A quick boundary test certifies non-columnity whenever |J_0|∉{1/m}.
- Two-order mechanism for K={0,1,2} completed. When c_1=c_3, a single tile admits two distinct singleton tilings corresponding to the cyclic orders (1→2→3→1) and (1→3→2→1); the slopes differ by c_1 modulo 1. Non-columnity follows from the boundary obstruction when c_1∉{1/m}. If c_1 is rational and the slope is irrational, the two periods are incommensurable.
- Rigidity for Theorem A-type tiles. For the complementary two-layer tiles with |J_0|=1/2 that do not admit a two-translate partition of S^1, every tiling is automatically singleton-per-row. This streamlines irreducibility and supports further classification.

Theorem A (Non-column tile with two incommensurable periods). Fix an irrational α∈(0,1/2). Let U⊂S^1 be a finite union of disjoint intervals of total length 1/4 such that U∩(U+1/2)=∅ and the multiset of lengths of connected components of U is different from that of its complement in [0,1/2). Define J_0:=U∪(U+1/2) (so |J_0|=1/2 and J_0+1/2=J_0), J_1:=S^1\(J_0+α), and set A:=( {0}×J_0 ) ∪ ( {1}×J_1 ). Then:
(i) There is a tiling T_α with period (1,α), and a tiling T_{α+1/2} with period (1,α+1/2).
(ii) Both tilings are irreducible.
(iii) A is not a column (i.e., there is no finite X⊂Z and T⊂Z×S^1 with A+T=X×S^1).
(iv) The periods are incommensurable: α/(α+1/2)∉Q.
Proof. (i)–(iv) As in the previous version; we only note that (iii) can also be deduced from Corollary F by instead choosing |J_0|∉{1/m}, in which case the boundary obstruction immediately rules out finite-column tilings. ∎

Lemma B (Irreducibility for singleton tilings with gcd(K−K)=1). Let A have layers at K={k_1,…,k_ℓ} and suppose |T_n|=1 for all n (singleton). Let H:=⟨K−K⟩≤Z. If H=Z then any tiling is irreducible.
Proof. Assume a decomposition T=T_1⊔T_2 such that A+T_i=X_i×S^1 with Z=X_1⊔X_2 disjoint. Fix m∈X_1. In row m the contributing anchors are exactly at indices m−k_i (one per i). If for some i we had m−k_i∉X_1, then the corresponding interval [a_i+θ_{m−k_i},b_i+θ_{m−k_i}] would belong to A+T_2 and yet lie inside row m∈X_1, contradicting A+T_1=X_1×S^1. Hence m−k_i∈X_1 for all i, so X_1 is closed under subtraction by each k_i, hence under ±(K−K). Therefore X_1 is a union of cosets of H. If H=Z, only ∅ and Z occur, proving irreducibility. ∎

Lemma B′ (Reducibility when gcd(K−K)>1). Let H:=⟨K−K⟩ and suppose H≠Z, with index g:=[Z:H]>1. For r=0,1,…,g−1 let T^{(r)}:={ (z,θ)∈T : z≡r (mod g) } and X_r:=gZ+r. Then A+T^{(r)}=X_r×S^1 a.e., and thus A+T is reducible into g disjoint tilings along residue classes mod g.
Proof. A translate anchored at z contributes only to rows z+k_i, each ≡z (mod g). Hence only anchors with z≡r can contribute to rows in X_r, and conversely all coverage of a row m∈X_r comes from T^{(r)}. Disjointness across distinct r is automatic since they occupy disjoint rows. ∎

Lemma C (Singleton congruences under a fixed cyclic order: necessity and sufficiency). Assume |T_n|=1 and that on every row the ℓ intervals appear in the same cyclic order σ and meet end-to-end. Let c_i:=b_i−a_i and β:=θ_n−θ_{n−1} (mod 1). Then the adjacency constraints are equivalent to the congruence system
  (k_i − k_{σ(i)}) β ≡ a_i + c_i − a_{σ(i)}  (mod 1),  i=1,…,ℓ.
Proof. Necessity: matching the right endpoint of i with the left endpoint of σ(i) and using θ_{m−k_i}−θ_{m−k_{σ(i)}}=(k_{σ(i)}−k_i)β gives the displayed congruences. Sufficiency: Given β solving these congruences, define θ_n:=θ_0+nβ. At row m put intervals I_i:=[a_i+θ_{m−k_i}, a_i+θ_{m−k_i}+c_i]. The congruences read a_i+θ_{m−k_i}+c_i ≡ a_{σ(i)}+θ_{m−k_{σ(i)}}, so the right endpoint of I_i equals the left endpoint of I_{σ(i)}. Summing lengths gives ∑_i|I_i|=∑_ic_i=1. Thus the I_i meet end-to-end around the circle in the σ-order and (apart from endpoints) are disjoint, forming an a.e. partition of S^1. ∎

Assume c_1=c_3=s and s∉{1/m: m∈N}. Then there exist endpoints a_1,a_2,a_3 and an irrational slope β such that the tile A:=⋃_{i=1}^3({k_i}×[a_i,b_i]) admits two distinct singleton tilings corresponding to the cyclic orders σ=(1→2→3→1) and σ′=(1→3→2→1), with slopes β and β′≡β−s (mod 1), respectively. Both tilings are irreducible, their periods are incommensurable if s is rational, and A is not a column.
Proof. As before: Lemma C and its supplement give existence; Lemma B yields irreducibility (⟨K−K⟩=Z). If s∈Q and β∉Q, then β/β′∈Q would force β∈Q. Non-column follows from Lemma E at k=0 and k=2 since 1/s∉N. ∎

Supplement to Proposition D (explicit algebra). [As before.] ∎

Proposition I (Singleton rigidity for the |J_0|=1/2 complementary tiles). Let A=({0}×J_0)∪({1}×J_1) with J_1=S^1\(J_0+α) and |J_0|=|J_1|=1/2. Assume J_0 does not admit a two-translate partition of S^1 (i.e., there is no δ with J_0 ⊔ (J_0+δ)=S^1 a.e.). Then every tiling A+T=Z×S^1 satisfies |T_n|=1 for all n.
Proof. Let d_n:=|T_n|. The per-row measure identity gives d_n+d_{n−1}=2 for all n. If d_n=2 for some n, then d_{n−1}=0 and row n is covered solely by two disjoint translates of J_0, contradicting the hypothesis. Similarly, d_n=0 is impossible. Hence d_n=1 for all n. ∎

Corollary J (Row-to-row increment constraint in the complementary case). In the setting of Proposition I, writing T_n={θ_n}, for every m we have J_0+θ_m = J_0+(α+θ_{m−1}) a.e. Hence θ_m−θ_{m−1}−α∈Stab(J_0):={t∈S^1 : J_0+t=J_0 a.e.}. In particular, if J_0 has 1/q-periodicity and no finer translational invariance, then θ_m−θ_{m−1}∈α+(1/q)Z for all m.
Proof. From U_m=⋃_{θ∈T_m}(J_0+θ) and U_m=S^1\V_m with V_m=⋃_{θ∈T_{m−1}}(J_1+θ), Proposition I gives d_m=d_{m−1}=1, so U_m=J_0+θ_m and also U_m=J_0+(α+θ_{m−1}). Thus J_0+θ_m=J_0+(α+θ_{m−1}) a.e. The stabilizer conclusion follows immediately. ∎

Lemma R (Rational-shift incommensurability). If α∉Q and a≠b∈Q, then (α+a)/(α+b)∉Q. In particular, if α∉Q and r∈Q\{0}, then α/(α+r)∉Q.
Proof. If (α+a)/(α+b)=p/q∈Q, then α+a=(p/q)(α+b), so (1−p/q)α=(p/q)b−a∈Q. Since a≠b, 1−p/q≠0, hence α∈Q, a contradiction. The special case takes b=0 and a=r. ∎

Remark on endpoint conventions. Complements produce open arcs; choosing closed representatives modifies sets only on measure-zero boundaries and does not affect any a.e. tiling statements or measure identities above.
Additions, clarifications, and new tools

Remark (clarification for Lemma C). In the necessity direction we used the identity θ_{m−k_i}−θ_{m−k_{σ(i)}}=(k_{σ(i)}−k_i)β with β:=θ_n−θ_{n−1} independent of n. This constancy holds when 1∈K (as in our applications K={0,1} and {0,1,2}). For general K one needs a helical-phase conclusion from the fixed-order hypothesis before specializing to a constant β.

Lemma E (Boundary obstruction to finite-column tilings: explicit statement). Let A=\bigcup_i\{k_i\}×[a_i,b_i] and, for each height k, let the aggregated layer be J_k:=\bigcup_{i: k_i=k}[a_i,b_i] with measure μ_k:=|J_k|. Suppose A+T=X×S^1 with X finite, and write d_n:=|T_n|. Then for all m∈Z we have the per-row identity
  \sum_k μ_k · d_{m−k} = 1_{m∈X}.
If p:=min X and k_min:=min\{k_i\}, then only anchors at z=p−k_min can contribute to row p, hence μ_{k_min}·d_{p−k_min}=1. Similarly, if q:=max X and k_max:=max\{k_i\}, then μ_{k_max}·d_{q−k_max}=1. In particular, if 1/μ_{k_min}∉N or 1/μ_{k_max}∉N, then no such finite-column tiling exists (A is not a column).
Proof. The per-row identity is the a.e. disjointness of the row-unions. The boundary constraints follow by localization: any anchor z<p−k_min would create coverage below p; any anchor z=p−k with k>k_min creates coverage at row p−(k−k_min)<p. Thus only z=p−k_min contributes to row p, where S^1 is partitioned a.e. by d_{p−k_min} copies of J_{k_min}. The right boundary is analogous. ∎

Lemma T (Fourier two-translate obstruction). Let E⊂S^1 be measurable. If there exists δ with E+δ = S^1\E a.e., then for every t∈Z\{0} with \hat{1_E}(t)≠0 we have e^{2π i t δ}=−1. In particular, if \hat{1_E}(2) and \hat{1_E}(4) are both nonzero, no such δ can exist.
Proof. Taking Fourier coefficients in 1_{E+δ}+1_E=1 gives e^{2π i t δ} \hat{1_E}(t)+\hat{1_E}(t)=0 for all t≠0, hence e^{2π i t δ}=−1 whenever \hat{1_E}(t)≠0. For t=2 and t=4 this would impose δ≡1/2 (mod 1) and δ≡1/4 (mod 1) simultaneously, impossible. ∎

Proposition S (Singleton rigidity via integrality exclusion for complementary two-layer tiles). Let A=({0}×J_0)∪({1}×J_1) with J_1=S^1\(J_0+α). If either 1/|J_0|∉N or 1/|J_1|=1/(1−|J_0|)∉N, then every tiling A+T=Z×S^1 satisfies |T_n|=1 for all n.
Proof. Let d_n:=|T_n| and U_n:=\bigcup_{θ∈T_n}(J_0+θ). The intersection identity yields U_n = \bigcap_{θ∈T_{n−1}}(J_0+α+θ) a.e., hence if d_{n−1}≥1 then |U_n|≤|J_0| and therefore d_n≤1 (since U_n is a disjoint union of d_n copies of J_0). If some d_m=0, then the per-row measure identity |J_0| d_m + (1−|J_0|) d_{m−1}=1 forces (1−|J_0|) d_{m−1}=1, contradicting 1/(1−|J_0|)∉N. Symmetrically, if some d_{m−1}=0, then |J_0| d_m=1 contradicts 1/|J_0|∉N. Thus no d is 0; since d_{n−1}≥1 we get d_n≤1 for all n, hence d_n=1. ∎

Proposition K (Meandering classification of singleton tilings for the complementary construction). Let A=({0}×J_0)∪({1}×J_1) with J_1=S^1\(J_0+α). Suppose A+T=Z×S^1 is singleton per row (T_n={θ_n}). Then for every n,
  J_0+θ_n = J_0+(α+θ_{n−1}) a.e., equivalently Δ_n:=θ_n−θ_{n−1}−α ∈ Stab(J_0):=\{t∈S^1 : J_0+t=J_0 a.e.\}.
Conversely, for any bi-infinite sequence (Δ_n) with values in Stab(J_0), the sequence θ_n:=θ_0+\sum_{j=1}^n(α+Δ_j) defines a singleton tiling T={(n,θ_n)}.
Proof. The “only if” follows from U_n=J_0+θ_n=S^1\V_n and V_n=\bigcup_{θ∈T_{n−1}}(J_1+θ)=S^1\(J_0+α+θ_{n−1}). The “if” direction: if Δ_n∈Stab(J_0), then J_0+θ_n=J_0+α+θ_{n−1} a.e., so in row n the two contributions are complementary a.e., giving a tiling with a.e. disjointness across all rows. ∎

Proposition K2 (Singleton rigidity for complementary two-layer tiles under anti-m-tiling hypotheses). Let A=({0}×J_0)∪({1}×J_1) with J_1=S^1\(J_0+α). Suppose neither J_0 nor J_1 admits an m-fold partition of S^1 by pairwise a.e. disjoint translates for any integer m≥2. Then every tiling A+T=Z×S^1 is singleton per row: |T_n|=1 for all n.
Proof. Let d_n:=|T_n| and U_n:=\bigcup_{θ∈T_n}(J_0+θ), V_n:=\bigcup_{θ∈T_{n−1}}(J_1+θ). As before U_n⊔V_n=S^1 a.e. and U_n=\bigcap_{θ∈T_{n−1}}(J_0+α+θ) a.e. If d_{n−1}≥2, then there exist θ≠θ′ in T_{n−1} with θ′−θ∉Stab(J_1)=Stab(J_0), hence |(J_0+α+θ)∩(J_0+α+θ′)|<|J_0| and thus |U_n|<|J_0|, forcing d_n=0. Then V_n=S^1 a.e., so S^1 is the a.e. disjoint union of d_{n−1} copies of J_1, i.e. an m-translate tiling with m=d_{n−1}≥2, a contradiction. Hence d_{n−1}≤1; by symmetry d_n≤1. Finally, d_{n−1}=0 would force U_n=S^1 and hence an m-translate tiling by J_0 with m=d_n≥2, again a contradiction. Therefore d_{n−1}=d_n=1 for all n. ∎

Lemma Q (Incommensurability via ratio). If s∈(0,1) and β∉Q satisfy s/β∉Q, then β/(β−s)∉Q.
Proof. If β/(β−s)=p/q∈Q, then (q−p)β=ps, hence s/β=(q−p)/p∈Q, a contradiction. ∎

Addendum to Proposition I. The symmetric step “d_n=0 is impossible” uses that J_1 admits a two-translate partition iff J_0 does: E+δ=S^1\E a.e. iff (S^1\E)+δ=E a.e. Since J_1 is a translate of S^1\J_0, the hypothesis for J_0 automatically forbids the corresponding partition for J_1. ∎
