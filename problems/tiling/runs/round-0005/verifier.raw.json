They correct a genuine error in the m=3 Fourier sketch, close a justification gap in Theorem A’s non-column proof via a clean combinatorial invariant, and add compact structural lemmas (periodicity from periodic increments; boundary rational-independence test; minimal component length for columns). These are small but meaningful increments that improve rigor and streamline arguments.\\n\\nKey correctness points and fixes:\\n- m=3 Fourier obstruction: Report 02 correctly points out the earlier t and 2t sketch was wrong (cube roots satisfy both). Their Lemma M3 (use t and 3t) is correct and sharp: from 1 = Σ 1_{E+δ_j} one gets Σ x_j = 0 for x_j = e^{2πitδ_j} whenever \\\\hat{1_E}(t) ≠ 0. If also \\\\hat{1_E}(3t) ≠ 0, Newton’s identity yields Σ x_j^3 = 3x_1x_2x_3 ≠ 0, contradiction. We will add this lemma to output.md and remove any reliance on the flawed t/2t sketch.\\n- Lemma T modulus wording: Both 02 and 03 caught the minor slip. The contradiction should be stated in congruence form: e^{2πitδ} = −1 ⇒ tδ ≡ 1/2 (mod 1). For t=2, δ ≡ 1/4 (mod 1/2); for t=4, δ ≡ 1/8 (mod 1/4), incompatible. We’ll fix this in output.md.\\n- Component-length obstruction: Report 01’s lemma is correct and precisely what was implicitly used in Theorem A(iii). We add it to output.md and explicitly cite it in the proof of (iii), making that step Fourier-free and fully formal.\\n- Periodicity from periodic increments: Reports 01/02/03 propose equivalent formulations. We include a polished Lemma P (iff) in output.md immediately after Proposition K; this both corrects the previously over-ambitious “constant increment” target and cleanly classifies periodic singleton tilings produced by the complementary construction.\\n- Boundary tools and columns: We remove the duplicate placeholder “Lemma E [As before]” and keep the explicit statement. We add (i) the two-sided rational-independence corollary (μ_{k_min}/μ_{k_max} ∉ Q forbids columns) and (ii) the minimal-component-length lemma: any finite column component must have length ≥ (k_max − k_min) + 1; in particular no single-row column exists if the tile spans multiple heights. Both are correct and useful.\\n- Proposition H incommensurability clause: We include the remark that s/β ∉ Q ⇒ β/(β − s) ∉ Q (Lemma Q), allowing incommensurability without assuming s ∈ Q by a suitable choice of β.\\n\\nTriage/value:\\n- Keep: Lemma M3 (m=3 Fourier), component-length obstruction, periodicity⇔periodic increments (Lemma P), boundary ratio test, minimal component length. These are robust and broadly useful.\\n- Housekeeping: Remove duplicate Lemma E; fix Lemma T; make Proposition G self-contained (short proof added); keep stabilizer symmetry as a small lemma.\\n- Defer: General rigidity for q≥3 (constant increments) is false in general (Proposition K shows meanders). Frame the correct target as “classification of periodic tilings via periodic increments.”\\n\\nNext steps for provers:\\n- Fourier beyond m=3: For m≥4, Σ x_j = 0 together with a few higher power sums p_k = Σ x_j^k = 0 (for k in a set where \\\\hat{1_E}(k t) ≠ 0) can be combined via Newton’s identities to force contradictions. Seek E with a prescribed nonvanishing spectrum at k ∈ {1,2,3,…} that makes the system inconsistent for the desired m.\\n- Explicit |E|=1/3 examples: Construct E with \\\\hat{1_E}(t), \\\\hat{1_E}(3t) ≠ 0 (e.g., small unions of arcs) and apply Lemma M3 to feed Proposition K2 (anti-m-tiling hypothesis) to force singleton tilings.\\n- K={0,1,2} and beyond: Use the minimal component-length lemma + Lemma E to rule out columns systematically; enumerate fixed orders (via Lemma C) and search for multi-order coexistence; combine with Lemma P to list all periodic tilings (period and slope) arising.\\n- Stabilizer control: For complementary constructions with Stab(J_0)=(1/q)Z, explore additional structural hypotheses that might force the increments to be eventually periodic (e.g., endpoint propagation constraints), yielding classification of all periodic solutions.\\n\",\"new_notes_md\":\"New tools and corrections (Round 0005)\\n\\n1) Component-length obstruction to complementary translation\\n- Lemma. Let E ⊂ S^1 be a finite union of closed intervals with disjoint interiors. Write L(E) for the multiset of component lengths of E, and G(E) for the multiset of cyclic gap lengths between consecutive endpoints of E. If E+δ = S^1\\\\E a.e. for some δ, then L(E) = G(E) as multisets. Thus L(E) ≠ G(E) forbids such a δ.\\n- Use in Theorem A(iii). For J_0=U ∪ (U+1/2) with a suitable U (e.g., U=[0,0.2) ∪ [0.3,0.35)), we have L(J_0) ≠ G(J_0), hence no two-translate complement exists. This closes the non-column step without Fourier.\\n\\n2) Fourier obstruction for 3 translates (fix of the earlier sketch)\\n- Lemma M3. If S^1 is a.e. the disjoint union of three translates E+δ_1, E+δ_2, E+δ_3, then for every t≠0 with \\\\hat{1_E}(t)≠0 we have Σ_{j=1}^3 e^{2πitδ_j}=0. In particular, if \\\\hat{1_E}(t) and \\\\hat{1_E}(3t) are both nonzero, no such 3-translate tiling exists.\\n- Proof idea. Let x_j:=e^{2πitδ_j}. From the partition, for t≠0 we have (Σ x_j) \\\\hat{1_E}(t)=0 ⇒ Σ x_j=0. If also \\\\hat{1_E}(3t)≠0 then Σ x_j^3=0. Newton’s identity for three variables gives Σ x_j^3 = 3x_1x_2x_3, impossible since |x_j|=1.\\n\\n3) Periodicity of singleton complementary tilings ⇔ periodicity of increments\\n- Lemma P. In the complementary construction with singleton rows, write Δ_n:=θ_n−θ_{n−1}−α ∈ Stab(J_0) (Proposition K). Then T has period (r, α_*) iff Δ_{n+r}=Δ_n for all n and α_* ≡ rα + Σ_{j=1}^r Δ_j (mod 1). In particular, aperiodic (Δ_n) yield aperiodic tilings; r-periodic (Δ_n) yield period (r, α_*).\\n\\n4) Two-sided boundary obstruction by rational independence (quick non-column test)\\n- Corollary (to Lemma E). With k_min:=min K, k_max:=max K, if A+T=X×S^1 with X finite, then μ_{k_min} d_{p−k_min}=1 and μ_{k_max} d_{q−k_max}=1 at the left/right boundaries. Therefore μ_{k_min}/μ_{k_max} ∈ Q. If this ratio is irrational, A cannot be a column.\\n\\n5) Minimal component length for finite columns; no single-row columns when k_min<k_max\\n- Lemma. If K spans at least two heights (k_min<k_max) and A+T=X×S^1 is a finite-column tiling with a connected component [p,q]⊂X, then q−p+1 ≥ (k_max−k_min)+1. In particular, no single-row column exists. Equivalently, anchors contributing to a boundary row necessarily force coverage extending by ≥k_max−k_min rows.\\n\\n6) Stabilizer symmetry\\n- Lemma. Stab(E)=Stab(S^1\\\\E)=Stab(E+α) a.e. (trivial from indicator identities). This underlies the symmetric steps in K2 and the complementary construction.\\n\\n7) Corrections and housekeeping\\n- Lemma T (Fourier two-translate) contradiction should be stated as congruences: e^{2πitδ}=−1 ⇒ tδ ≡ 1/2 (mod 1). For t=2, δ ≡ 1/4 (mod 1/2); for t=4, δ ≡ 1/8 (mod 1/4), incompatible.\\n- Remove duplicate placeholder for Lemma E in output.md; keep only the explicit statement with proof.\\n- Proposition H remark. Incommensurability of β and β′=β−s holds whenever s/β ∉ Q (Lemma Q), not only for s rational; choose β accordingly.\\n\\n8) Program update (targets)\\n- Replace the (incorrect) global “constant increment” rigidity target by: classify periodic solutions via periodic increments (Lemma P) and exhibit aperiodic meanders when Stab(J_0)≠{0}.\\n- Strengthen Fourier obstructions for m≥4 using Newton’s identities with multiple nonvanishing modes of E. Seek explicit E with prescribed nonvanishing spectrum (e.g., unions of short arcs) to enforce anti-m-tiling hypotheses used in K2.\\n\",\"new_notes_append\":\"True\",\"new_outputs_md\":\"Summary of proven results and why they matter\\n- Main existence theorem (Theorem A). We construct an explicit non-column tile A ⊂ Z×S^1 that admits two irreducible tilings with incommensurable vertical periods (1,α) and (1,α+1/2), α irrational.\\n- Boundary and structural tools. We record a precise boundary obstruction (Lemma E), a two-sided rational-independence corollary, and a minimal component-length lemma for finite columns. Together these provide quick non-column tests across many K.\\n- Fourier obstructions. We include a corrected and robust two-translate obstruction (Lemma T) and a new m=3 obstruction (Lemma M3) based on t and 3t, which replaces an earlier incorrect sketch.\\n- Complementary two-layer family: meanders and periods. Singleton tilings are classified by per-row increments in Stab(J_0) (Proposition K). We add a precise equivalence (Lemma P) between periodicity of increments and periodicity of the tiling, subsuming the helical cases and exhibiting many aperiodic examples when Stab(J_0)≠{0}.\\n- Two-order mechanism for K={0,1,2}. When c_1=c_3, a single tile admits two distinct singleton tilings corresponding to the two cyclic orders; non-columnity follows from boundary obstructions; incommensurability holds under a mild irrationality condition (Lemma Q).\\n\\nTheorem A (Non-column tile with two incommensurable periods). Fix an irrational α∈(0,1/2). Let U⊂S^1 be a finite union of disjoint intervals of total length 1/4 such that U∩(U+1/2)=∅ and L(U)≠G(U) inside [0,1/2), where L(·),G(·) are the multisets of component and gap lengths. Define J_0:=U∪(U+1/2) (so |J_0|=1/2 and J_0+1/2=J_0), J_1:=S^1\\\\(J_0+α), and set A:=( {0}×J_0 ) ∪ ( {1}×J_1 ). Then:\\n(i) There is a tiling T_α with period (1,α), and a tiling T_{α+1/2} with period (1,α+1/2).\\n(ii) Both tilings are irreducible.\\n(iii) A is not a column (i.e., there is no finite X⊂Z and T⊂Z×S^1 with A+T=X×S^1).\\n(iv) The periods are incommensurable: α/(α+1/2)∉Q.\\nProof. (i) For θ_0 arbitrary, T_α={(n,θ_0+nα)} yields on row n the union (J_0+θ_n) ⊔ (J_1+θ_{n−1}) with θ_n=θ_0+nα; since J_1=S^1\\\\(J_0+α), this is S^1 a.e. Using J_0+1/2=J_0, the same argument gives T_{α+1/2}. (ii) Singleton-per-row implies irreducible because ⟨K−K⟩=Z (Lemma B). (iii) Suppose A+T=X×S^1 with X finite. At the left boundary row p of a component of X the per-row disjointness forces a two-translate partition of S^1 by J_0 alone; by the component-length obstruction lemma (Lemma CL below) applied to J_0, this is impossible. (iv) If α/(α+1/2)=p/q∈Q, then α=p/(2(q−p))∈Q, contradiction. ∎\\n\\nLemma B (Irreducibility for singleton tilings with gcd(K−K)=1). Let A have layers at K={k_1,…,k_ℓ} and suppose |T_n|=1 for all n. Let H:=⟨K−K⟩≤Z. If H=Z then any tiling is irreducible.\\nProof. If T=T_1⊔T_2 with A+T_i=X_i×S^1 and Z=X_1⊔X_2, then from m∈X_1 we deduce m−k_i∈X_1 for all i, so X_1 is a union of cosets of H. If H=Z, only ∅ and Z can occur. ∎\\n\\nLemma B′ (Reducibility when gcd(K−K)>1). If H:=⟨K−K⟩ has index g>1, decompose T by residues mod g: T^{(r)}:={ (z,θ)∈T : z≡r (mod g) }. Then A+T^{(r)}=X_r×S^1 with X_r:=gZ+r, so the tiling splits along residue classes. ∎\\n\\nLemma C (Singleton congruences under a fixed cyclic order: necessity and sufficiency). Assume |T_n|=1 and that on every row the ℓ intervals appear in the same cyclic order σ and meet end-to-end. Let c_i:=b_i−a_i and β:=θ_n−θ_{n−1} (mod 1). Then\\n  (k_i − k_{σ(i)}) β ≡ a_i + c_i − a_{σ(i)}  (mod 1),  i=1,…,ℓ.\\nNecessity and sufficiency as in the previous version. ∎\\n\\nLemma E (Boundary obstruction to finite-column tilings: explicit statement). Let A=⋃_i {k_i}×[a_i,b_i] and, for each height k, let the aggregated layer be J_k:=⋃_{i: k_i=k}[a_i,b_i] with μ_k:=|J_k|. Suppose A+T=X×S^1 with X finite, and write d_n:=|T_n|. Then for all m∈Z\\n  Σ_k μ_k · d_{m−k} = 1_{m∈X}.\\nIf p:=min X and k_min:=min K, then μ_{k_min}·d_{p−k_min}=1. If q:=max X and k_max:=max K, then μ_{k_max}·d_{q−k_max}=1. In particular, if 1/μ_{k_min}∉N or 1/μ_{k_max}∉N, then A is not a column. ∎\\n\\nLemma T (Fourier two-translate obstruction; corrected congruences). Let E⊂S^1 be measurable. If there exists δ with E+δ = S^1\\\\E a.e., then for every t∈Z\\\\{0} with \\\\hat{1_E}(t)≠0 we have e^{2πitδ}=−1, i.e. tδ ≡ 1/2 (mod 1). In particular, if \\\\hat{1_E}(2), \\\\hat{1_E}(4) ≠ 0, no such δ can exist because δ ≡ 1/4 (mod 1/2) and δ ≡ 1/8 (mod 1/4) are incompatible. ∎\\n\\nLemma CL (Component-length obstruction). Let E⊂S^1 be a finite union of closed intervals with disjoint interiors, with component-length multiset L(E) and gap-length multiset G(E). If E+δ = S^1\\\\E a.e. for some δ, then L(E)=G(E) as multisets. Hence L(E)≠G(E) forbids a two-translate complement. ∎\\n\\nLemma M3 (Fourier obstruction to 3-translate tilings). If S^1 is a.e. the disjoint union of three translates E+δ_1,E+δ_2,E+δ_3, then for every t≠0 with \\\\hat{1_E}(t)≠0 one has Σ_{j=1}^3 e^{2πitδ_j}=0. In particular, if there exists t with \\\\hat{1_E}(t), \\\\hat{1_E}(3t) ≠ 0, then no such 3-translate tiling exists.\\nProof. Let x_j:=e^{2πitδ_j}. The partition identity gives (Σ x_j) \\\\hat{1_E}(t)=0 for t≠0. If \\\\hat{1_E}(t)≠0, then Σ x_j=0. If also \\\\hat{1_E}(3t)≠0, then Σ x_j^3=0. Newton’s identity p_3 = e_1 p_2 − e_2 p_1 + 3e_3 with e_1=Σ x_j=0 and p_1=Σ x_j=0 gives Σ x_j^3 = 3x_1x_2x_3 ≠ 0, contradiction. ∎\\n\\nCorollary E′ (Two-sided boundary rational-independence test). In the setting of Lemma E, μ_{k_min}·d_{p−k_min}=1 and μ_{k_max}·d_{q−k_max}=1 force μ_{k_min}/μ_{k_max}∈Q. Hence if μ_{k_min}/μ_{k_max}∉Q, A is not a column. ∎\\n\\nLemma N (Minimal component length for finite columns; no single-row columns). Let K have k_min<k_max. If A+T=X×S^1 with X finite and [p,q] is a connected component of X, then q−p+1 ≥ (k_max−k_min)+1. In particular, no single-row column exists.\\nProof. Any anchor (z,θ) contributes to rows z+k, k∈K. To avoid coverage outside [p,q], one must have z∈[p−k_min, q−k_max]. Coverage of row p requires anchors with z=p−k for some k∈K; the only such z in [p−k_min, q−k_max] is z=p−k_min. Similarly, coverage of row q requires z=q−k_max. Existence of both requires p−k_min ≤ q−k_max, i.e. q−p ≥ k_max−k_min. ∎\\n\\nProposition S (Singleton rigidity via integrality exclusion for complementary two-layer tiles). Let A=({0}×J_0)∪({1}×J_1) with J_1=S^1\\\\(J_0+α). If either 1/|J_0|∉N or 1/|J_1|∉N, then every tiling satisfies |T_n|=1. Proof as before. ∎\\n\\nProposition G (q-phase generalization of the complementary 2-layer construction). If J_0⊂S^1 satisfies J_0+1/q=J_0 and J_1:=S^1\\\\(J_0+α) with α irrational, then for each j=0,1,…,q−1 the singleton set T_{α+j/q}:={(n,θ_0+n(α+j/q))} is a tiling with period (1,α+j/q). For j≠j′, the periods are incommensurable (Lemma R). If |J_0|∉{1/m}, then A is not a column (Lemma E).\\nProof. As in Theorem A(i). Incommensurability: apply Lemma R with a=j/q, b=j′/q. The boundary conclusion follows from Lemma E at the two extremes. ∎\\n\\nProposition H (K={0,1,2} two-order mechanism). Let K=(0,1,2) and c_i=b_i−a_i>0 with c_1+c_2+c_3=1. If c_1=c_3=s∉{1/m}, there exist endpoints and an irrational slope β such that A admits two distinct singleton tilings with orders (1→2→3→1) and (1→3→2→1), slopes β and β′≡β−s (mod 1), respectively. Both are irreducible; A is not a column. If s∈Q and β∉Q, the periods are incommensurable. Remark: more generally, incommensurability holds whenever s/β ∉ Q (Lemma Q). ∎\\n\\nProposition I (Singleton rigidity for |J_0|=1/2 complementary tiles). Let A=({0}×J_0)∪({1}×J_1) with J_1=S^1\\\\(J_0+α) and |J_0|=|J_1|=1/2. If J_0 admits no two-translate partition of S^1, then every tiling is singleton per row. ∎\\n\\nCorollary J (Row-to-row increment constraint in the complementary case). In the setting of Proposition I, with T_n={θ_n}, we have θ_m−θ_{m−1}−α ∈ Stab(J_0) for all m; in particular, if Stab(J_0)=(1/q)Z a.e., then θ_m−θ_{m−1} ∈ α+(1/q)Z. ∎\\n\\nProposition K (Meandering classification of singleton complementary tilings). In the complementary construction, if |T_n|=1, then Δ_n:=θ_n−θ_{n−1}−α ∈ Stab(J_0) for all n, and conversely any bi-infinite (Δ_n)⊂Stab(J_0) produces a tiling. ∎\\n\\nLemma P (Periodicity ⇔ periodic increments). In the setting of Proposition K, T has period (r,α_*) iff Δ_{n+r}=Δ_n for all n and α_* ≡ rα + Σ_{j=1}^r Δ_j (mod 1). In particular, nonperiodic (Δ_n) produce aperiodic tilings, while r-periodic (Δ_n) produce period (r,α_*). ∎\\n\\nLemma Q (Incommensurability via ratio). If s∈(0,1) and β∉Q satisfy s/β∉Q, then β/(β−s)∉Q. ∎\\n\\nLemma R (Rational-shift incommensurability). If α∉Q and a≠b∈Q, then (α+a)/(α+b)∉Q. ∎\\n\\nLemma SS (Stabilizer symmetry). For measurable E⊂S^1 and α∈S^1, Stab(E)=Stab(S^1\\\\E)=Stab(E+α) a.e. ∎\\n\\nRemark on endpoints. Complements produce open arcs; choosing closed representatives changes sets only on null boundaries and does not affect any a.e. tiling or measure identity above.\\n\",\"new_outputs_append\":\"False\",\"verdict\":\"partial success\"}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"auto","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"VerifierNewSchema","schema_":{"properties":{"feedback_md":{"title":"Feedback Md","type":"string"},"new_notes_md":{"title":"New Notes Md","type":"string"},"new_notes_append":{"title":"New Notes Append","type":"string"},"new_outputs_md":{"title":"New Outputs Md","type":"string"},"new_outputs_append":{"title":"New Outputs Append","type":"string"},"verdict":{"title":"Verdict","type":"string"}},"required":["feedback_md","new_notes_md","new_notes_append","new_outputs_md","new_outputs_append","verdict"],"title":"VerifierNewSchema","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":17642,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":11191,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":5632},"total_tokens":28833},"user":null,"store":true}
