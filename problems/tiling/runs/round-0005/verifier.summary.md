Global assessment: The three reports are strong and largely compatible. They correct a genuine error in the m=3 Fourier sketch, close a justification gap in Theorem A’s non-column proof via a clean combinatorial invariant, and add compact structural lemmas (periodicity from periodic increments; boundary rational-independence test; minimal component length for columns). These are small but meaningful increments that improve rigor and streamline arguments.
