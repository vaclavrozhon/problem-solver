This round produced multiple explicit constructions showing a non-column finite tile A ⊂ Z×S^1 can admit two distinct irreducible periodic tilings with incommensurable vertical shifts. Two mechanisms emerged: (a) a 3-layer singleton-per-row scheme (K={0,1,2}) where two different cyclic orders of the three intervals give two different slopes α, α' (synchronizing conditions achieved when L_1=L_3); (b) a 2-layer construction (K={0,1}) using a 1/2-periodic layer J_0 that yields tilings with slopes α and α+1/2. Both approaches include proofs of irreducibility and arguments that the tile is not a column (the 3-layer non-column argument is sketched and planned to be formalized). Choosing irrational length parameters (or irrational shift α) gives α/α'∉Q. Verifier: success. Citations: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json, prover-03.out.json.

## round-0002 — model summary — 2025-08-28T14:37:14.500976Z
Round 0002 audited output.md and supplied several clean lemmas and simplifications. Theorem A (the complementary 2-layer construction) is confirmed: it yields two irreducible singleton tilings with incommensurable periods. Key additions: Lemma E completes the K={0,1,2} two-order family by a simple boundary argument; a general boundary lemma (d_{p−k_min}·μ_min = 1 ⇒ 1/μ_min ∈ N) streamlines all non-column proofs; Proposition G (q‑phase) produces q distinct incommensurable singleton tilings when J_0 is 1/q-periodic; and a Fourier obstruction gives a concrete test forbidding translational complements/partitions. An explicit algebraic check fills a computation gap in Proposition D (compatibility iff c1=c3, with β'≡β−c1). Recommended edits: add these lemmas/propositions to output.md and optionally relax the |J_0|=1/2 hypothesis in Theorem A. See prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json, prover-03.out.json for details. Verifier verdict: partial success.

## round-0003 — model summary — 2025-08-28T14:55:14.738946Z
Round 0003 audit and tightenings: the three reports confirm Theorem A and Proposition H are correct and add several small, auditable lemmas that strengthen and close gaps. Key additions: a gcd-necessity lemma (reducibility when gcd(K−K)>1), an explicit closure step for Lemma B, a one-line rational-shift incommensurability lemma, and (crucially) Lemma 1 + Corollary 2 showing that for the complementary two-layer construction every tiling is singleton-per-row and that row increments lie in α+Stab(J_0) (hence in α+(1/q)Z when J_0 is 1/q-periodic). Prover 03 supplies the sufficiency half of Lemma C (congruences ⇒ helical tilings) and tightens incommensurability claims for the K={0,1,2} family. Remaining work: prove increment-constancy (rigidity) to classify all tilings and formalize the Fourier obstruction for |J_0|=1/m corner cases. Verifier verdict: partial success.

## round-0004 — model summary — 2025-08-28T15:06:20.403010Z
Round 0004 audited output.md and added several short, checkable lemmas/tools that tighten constructions and non-column arguments. Main confirmations: Theorem A’s complementary two-layer construction is correct and the two helical tilings T_α and T_{α+1/2} are singleton and irreducible. New/strengthened results include Lemma S (singleton rigidity under integrality exclusions 1/(1−|J_0|)∉N or 1/|J_0|∉N), Proposition K (meandering classification: singleton tilings parameterized by increments δ_n ∈ Stab(J_0)), a generalized singleton rigidity result forbidding any m-fold translational tiling ⇒ |T_n|=1, Fourier two- and three-translate obstructions (with an explicit numeric check Lemma F2 for Theorem A), and a boundary-integrality lemma for general K. Concrete examples (q=3 family) and an incommensurability criterion (Lemma Q: s/β∉Q ⇒ β/(β−s)∉Q) were supplied. Verifier verdict: partial success.

## round-0005 — model summary — 2025-08-28T15:14:55.290600Z
Round 0005 performed a careful audit of output.md and introduced several small, auditable lemmas and fixes that close gaps and correct incorrect sketches. Major additions: a component-length obstruction lemma that fills the remaining step in Theorem A for |J_0|=1/2; a correct m=3 Fourier obstruction (Lemma M3) using frequencies t and 3t; a period-lifting lemma showing T is periodic iff the increments Δ_n are periodic, with period data α_* = rα + Σ_{j=1}^r Δ_j (so nonperiodic Δ produce aperiodic singleton tilings); a “no single-row column” lemma and a two-sided boundary rational-independence test that give quick non-column certificates (useful for K={0,1,2}). Housekeeping: remove duplicate Lemma E, fix modulus arithmetic in Lemma T, and add an incommensurability remark to Proposition H (via s/β ∉ Q). Action items: replace the incorrect m=3 sketch with Lemma M3 and a worked example, insert the period-lifting lemma and boundary tests into output.md, and update the “Next targets” to drop the impossible constant-increment rigidity in favor of periodic-Δ classification. Sources: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json, prover-03.out.json (Round 0005). Verifier: partial success (some higher-m/further rigidity issues remain).
