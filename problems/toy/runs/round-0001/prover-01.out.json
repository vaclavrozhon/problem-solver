  "progress_md": "Status and gaps\n- outputs.md not provided in this round; I assume no curated, fully rigorous proof has yet been recorded. I will propose a clean closure-based proof plan with self-contained lemmas and give complete proofs suitable for outputs.md. I also flag small technical points to watch (endpoints, index ranges, n \u2265 3).\n\nPlan (closure route to Dirac)\n- Prove the path-closing lemma: a Hamiltonian path with endpoints u,v and deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n closes to a Hamiltonian cycle. Why useful: it is the local engine for the Bondy\u2013Chv\u00e1tal single-edge step.\n- Deduce the single-edge closure equivalence: adding a nonedge uv with deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n preserves Hamiltonicity (iff). Why useful: allows iterative augmentation without changing Hamiltonicity.\n- Under \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2, every nonedge has deg-sum \u2265 n, so the iterative closure yields K_n; therefore G is Hamiltonian. Why useful: completes Dirac\u2019s theorem.\n- Record connectivity and 2-connectivity consequences of \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 and sharpness examples. Why useful: prevents false counterexamples and documents optimality of the bound.\n\nSetting\n- All graphs are finite, simple, undirected; n = |V(G)| \u2265 3. Write \u03b4(G) for the minimum degree.\n\nLemma 1 (Connectivity from \u03b4 \u2265 n/2)\n- Claim: If \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2, then G is connected.\n- Proof: If G were disconnected, let C be a smallest component, |C| = s. Each v \u2208 C has deg(v) \u2264 s \u2212 1. If s \u2264 n/2 then deg(v) \u2264 s \u2212 1 \u2264 n/2 \u2212 1 < n/2, contradicting \u03b4 \u2265 n/2. Hence s \u2265 n/2 + 1, but two disjoint components then have \u2265 (n/2 + 1) + (n/2 + 1) > n vertices, impossible. \u220e\n\nLemma 2 (2-connectivity from \u03b4 \u2265 n/2)\n- Claim: If \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2, then G has no cut-vertex.\n- Proof: Suppose w is a cut-vertex. Let the components of G \u2212 w be H_1,\u2026,H_t with t \u2265 2, and let s = min_i |V(H_i)|. For any x \u2208 V(H_i) (the smallest one), x has neighbors only in H_i and possibly w, hence deg(x) \u2264 (s \u2212 1) + 1 = s. Also s \u2264 (n \u2212 1)/2, so deg(x) \u2264 (n \u2212 1)/2 < n/2, contradicting \u03b4 \u2265 n/2. \u220e\n\nLemma 3 (Path-closing lemma)\n- Statement: Let G have a Hamiltonian path P = x_0 x_1 \u2026 x_{n\u22121} with endpoints u = x_0 and v = x_{n\u22121}. If uv \u2209 E(G) and deg(u) + deg(v) \u2265 n, then G has a Hamiltonian cycle.\n- Proof (indexing per notes): Define\n  A = { i \u2208 {1,\u2026,n\u22122} : u is adjacent to x_i },\n  B = { i \u2208 {2,\u2026,n\u22121} : v is adjacent to x_{i\u22121} }.\n  Because uv \u2209 E(G), every neighbor of u lies among {x_1,\u2026,x_{n\u22122}}, so |A| = deg(u). Likewise, every neighbor of v lies among {x_1,\u2026,x_{n\u22122}}, so |B| = deg(v) (via the shift i \u21a6 i \u2212 1).\n  For each i \u2208 {1,\u2026,n\u22122}, we cannot have both edges u x_i and v x_{i\u22121}, because then the cycle\n  x_0(=u) \u2014 x_i \u2014 x_{i+1} \u2014 \u2026 \u2014 x_{n\u22121}(=v) \u2014 x_{i\u22121} \u2014 x_{i\u22122} \u2014 \u2026 \u2014 x_1 \u2014 x_0\n  would be a Hamiltonian cycle in G already. Equivalently, A and B\u2032 := {i \u2212 1 : i \u2208 B} are disjoint subsets of {1,\u2026,n\u22122}. Hence |A| + |B\u2032| \u2264 n \u2212 2. But |B\u2032| = |B|, so deg(u) + deg(v) = |A| + |B| = |A| + |B\u2032| \u2264 n \u2212 2, contradicting deg(u) + deg(v) \u2265 n. Therefore some i has both edges present, giving the Hamiltonian cycle as displayed. \u220e\n- Why useful: This is the core combinatorial step ensuring we can remove a \u201cclosure edge\u201d from a Hamiltonian cycle and still recover Hamiltonicity in the original graph.\n\nLemma 4 (Single-edge closure equivalence)\n- Statement: Let uv \u2209 E(G) with deg(u) + deg(v) \u2265 n, and let G\u2032 = G + uv. Then G is Hamiltonian iff G\u2032 is Hamiltonian.\n- Proof: If G is Hamiltonian then so is its supergraph G\u2032. Conversely, suppose G\u2032 has a Hamiltonian cycle C. If C does not use uv, then C \u2286 G and we are done. If C uses uv, delete uv from C to obtain a Hamiltonian path P of G with endpoints u and v. Apply Lemma 3 to P and deg(u) + deg(v) \u2265 n to conclude that G has a Hamiltonian cycle. \u220e\n- Why useful: Allows iterative addition of edges with deg-sum \u2265 n without changing Hamiltonicity.\n\nLemma 5 (Closure to K_n under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2)\n- Claim: If \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2, then for every nonadjacent pair {u,v}, deg(u) + deg(v) \u2265 n. Consequently, adding all such nonedges yields K_n.\n- Proof: \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2 implies deg(u) \u2265 n/2 and deg(v) \u2265 n/2 for all u,v, so the sum is \u2265 n. Add any nonedge uv; degrees only increase, so at any stage every remaining nonedge still has deg-sum \u2265 n. Adding all of them produces a complete graph. \u220e\n- Why useful: Reduces Dirac to the trivial Hamiltonicity of K_n.\n\nTheorem (Dirac)\n- Statement: For n \u2265 3, every graph G with \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2 is Hamiltonian.\n- Proof: Iteratively add nonedges with deg-sum \u2265 n to obtain K_n (Lemma 5). By Lemma 4, Hamiltonicity is preserved at each addition, so G is Hamiltonian iff K_n is, and K_n is Hamiltonian for n \u2265 3. \u220e\n\nSharpness and examples\n- Even n = 2k: The complete bipartite graph K_{k\u22121, k+1} has \u03b4 = k \u2212 1 = n/2 \u2212 1 and is not Hamiltonian (unbalanced bipartite graphs have no spanning cycle). Shows the bound cannot be lowered below n/2.\n- Odd n = 2k + 1: K_{k, k+1} has \u03b4 = k = \u230an/2\u230b and is not Hamiltonian (all cycles are even in bipartite graphs). Shows replacing n/2 by \u230an/2\u230b would be false.\n\nChecks and potential pitfalls\n- n \u2265 3 is essential: for n = 2, \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 = 1 gives K_2, which has no Hamiltonian cycle in simple graphs (no 2-cycles). Our theorem correctly excludes n = 2.\n- Indexing in Lemma 3 carefully avoids referring to uv by restricting A to 1,\u2026,n\u22122 and using the shifted B. The disjointness is proved on A and B\u2032.\n- Closure of K_{n/2, n/2} is indeed K_n: nonedges lie within parts, and each such pair has deg-sum = n, so all are added. No contradiction with Dirac (K_{n/2,n/2} itself is Hamiltonian for n \u2265 4).\n\nAlternative route (for appendix)\n- One can also derive Dirac via Ore\u2019s theorem (if deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n for all nonadjacent u,v, then G is Hamiltonian), which in turn follows by the same single-edge closure lemma without fully iterating to K_n. Or via P\u00f3sa\u2019s rotation-extension method plus a longest-path argument. These are optional and not needed for the main proof.\n\nNext steps\n- Curate Lemmas 1\u20135 and the Dirac theorem proof into outputs.md with explicit statements and proofs as above.\n- Optionally add a brief note on 2-connectivity corollary and the sharpness examples.\n- If desired, include a short Ore-style proof as an appendix for completeness."
