Note and use the immediate consequence \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 \u21d2 every nonedge uv satisfies deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n.\n- Prove two basic structural lemmas under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2: (i) connectivity and (ii) 2-connectivity. Why useful: rules out trivial counterexamples and enables path/cycle splicing arguments.\n- Prove a path-closing lemma (pigeonhole on a Hamiltonian path between u and v with deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n). Why useful: this is the key single-step Bondy\u2013Chv\u00e1tal closure move.\n- Derive the single-edge closure equivalence (G is Hamiltonian iff G+uv is Hamiltonian when deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n).\n- Conclude Dirac via iterating closure to K_n; record sharpness examples and sanity checks; flag pitfalls.\n\nSetup and standing assumptions\n- All graphs are finite, simple, undirected; |V(G)| = n \u2265 3. \u03b4(G) denotes minimum degree. \u201cHamiltonian\u201d = containing a cycle through all n vertices.\n- Target statement (Dirac): If \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2, then G is Hamiltonian.\n- Immediate observation: If \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2 and uv is a nonedge, then deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n.\n\nClaim 1 (Connectivity and 2-connectivity from \u03b4 \u2265 n/2)\n- Statement: If \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2, then G is connected and has no cut-vertex (i.e., G is 2-connected).\n- Sketch proof:\n  - Connectivity: Suppose G has \u2265 2 components, with sizes a and b \u2265 1 and a+b \u2264 n. Any vertex in the component of size a has degree \u2264 a\u22121, contradicting \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 unless a\u22121 \u2265 n/2. But then a \u2265 n/2+1 and similarly b \u2265 n/2+1, so a+b \u2265 n+2, impossible. Thus G is connected.\n  - No cut-vertex: Suppose v is a cut-vertex, so G\u2212v has \u2265 2 components A, B with sizes a = |A|, b = |B| and a+b = n\u22121. Pick u \u2208 A. Then N(u) \u2286 (A\u2212{u}) \u222a {v}, so deg(u) \u2264 (a\u22121)+1 = a. By \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 we get a \u2265 n/2. Similarly b \u2265 n/2. Then a+b \u2265 n, contradicting a+b = n\u22121. Hence no cut-vertex.\n- Why useful here: longest-path/closure arguments typically need at least connectivity; 2-connectivity prevents trivial obstructions and aligns with Hamiltonicity.\n- How it can fail: For n small (e.g., n=2) statements are false/trivial; we assumed n \u2265 3. For the cut-vertex part, we used the easy bound deg(u) \u2264 a; the only way around is if some u had neighbors outside A\u222a{v}, but that\u2019s impossible by definition of components of G\u2212v.\n- Quick test: n=6, \u03b4 \u2265 3. Try to engineer a cut vertex. If G\u2212v had components of sizes 3 and 2, then a=3, b=2 fail b \u2265 n/2=3. Contradiction as expected.\n\nClaim 2 (Two common neighbors from a large degree sum)\n- Statement: If u,v are nonadjacent and deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n, then |N(u) \u2229 N(v)| \u2265 2.\n- Proof: N(u), N(v) \u2286 V \\ {u,v}, so |N(u) \u222a N(v)| \u2264 n\u22122. Inclusion\u2013exclusion gives |N(u) \u2229 N(v)| = deg(u)+deg(v) \u2212 |N(u) \u222a N(v)| \u2265 deg(u)+deg(v) \u2212 (n\u22122) \u2265 2.\n- Why useful here: shows abundance of overlaps; often used to pivot/rotate paths and to rule out local obstructions.\n- How it can fail: If we mistakenly allowed loops or multiple edges or counted u \u2208 N(u), v \u2208 N(v), the bound breaks; but in simple graphs, neighborhoods exclude the vertex itself.\n- Quick test: In K_{m,m} with n=2m, any two nonadjacent vertices lie in the same part and have exactly m common neighbors; lower bound 2 is satisfied for m \u2265 2.\n\nClaim 3 (Longest path lower bound)\n- Statement: Every graph has a path on at least \u03b4(G)+1 vertices.\n- Proof: Let P be a longest path with endpoints x,y. Then all neighbors of x lie on P, so deg(x) \u2264 |P|\u22121. Hence |P| \u2265 deg(x)+1 \u2265 \u03b4+1.\n- Why useful here: sanity check on reachability; under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 this already yields a path of length \u2265 n/2+1, a mild step toward Hamiltonicity.\n- How it can fail: If we allowed infinite graphs or directed edges, the statement needs modification; here finite and undirected suffices.\n- Quick test: For C_5 (\u03b4=2) the longest path has length 3 (i.e., 3 vertices), consistent with \u03b4+1=3.\n\nLemma 4 (Path-closing lemma; pigeonhole on a Hamiltonian path)\n- Statement: Let G be a graph on n vertices. Let P = x_0, x_1, ..., x_{n-1} be a Hamiltonian path in G with endpoints x_0 = u and x_{n-1} = v, and suppose uv is not an edge. If deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n, then G has a Hamiltonian cycle.\n- Proof: Consider index set I = {1,2,...,n\u22121}. Define\n  - A = { i \u2208 I : u is adjacent to x_i } so |A| = deg(u) (all neighbors of u lie among x_1,...,x_{n\u22121}).\n  - B = { i \u2208 I : v is adjacent to x_{i\u22121} } so |B| = deg(v) (neighbors of v lie among x_0,...,x_{n\u22122}).\n  Then A,B \u2286 I and |A|+|B| \u2265 n = |I|+1, hence A \u2229 B \u2260 \u2205. Take i \u2208 A \u2229 B. Edges ux_i and v x_{i\u22121} are present. The following closed walk is a Hamiltonian cycle:\n  u = x_0, x_1, ..., x_i, then jump via ux_i back to u? No\u2014use the chords in the order that preserves simplicity:\n  Construct the cycle\n  u \u2014 x_i \u2014 x_{i+1} \u2014 ... \u2014 x_{n\u22121}(=v) \u2014 x_{i\u22121} \u2014 x_{i\u22122} \u2014 ... \u2014 x_1 \u2014 u,\n  where the edges used are: ux_i (by choice i \u2208 A), the path edges x_j x_{j+1} for j = i,...,n\u22122, the chord v x_{i\u22121} (by choice i \u2208 B), and the path edges x_{j} x_{j\u22121} for j = i\u22121,...,1. This visits every x_j exactly once and returns to u, hence is a Hamiltonian cycle.\n- Why useful here: This is the combinatorial heart of the Bondy\u2013Chv\u00e1tal single-edge closure step.\n- How it can fail: The indexing must avoid using uv; that\u2019s why B is defined with predecessors x_{i\u22121}. A common pitfall is to pair u with x_i and v with x_{i+1}; that pairing does not directly yield a simple cycle without repetition.\n- Quick test: Take n=6, a Hamiltonian path P = (u,a,b,c,d,v) with deg(u)=deg(v)=3. If uv \u2209 E, then A = {indices of neighbors of u} and B = {indices whose predecessors neighbor v} both have size 3 in I={1,...,5}; intersection exists, e.g., i=3 could work (u\u2014c and v\u2014b), and the cycle is u\u2014c\u2014d\u2014v\u2014b\u2014a\u2014u.\n\nLemma 5 (Single-edge closure equivalence; Bondy\u2013Chv\u00e1tal step)\n- Statement: Let G be a graph on n vertices and u,v nonadjacent with deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n. Then G is Hamiltonian iff G' = G + uv is Hamiltonian.\n- Proof: \u201cOnly if\u201d is trivial. For \u201cif\u201d, assume G' has a Hamiltonian cycle. If that cycle does not use uv, it lies in G and we are done. Otherwise, delete edge uv from the cycle; what remains is a Hamiltonian path in G from u to v. By Lemma 4, G then has a Hamiltonian cycle.\n- Why useful here: This makes adding edges with large degree sum a Hamiltonicity-preserving operation.\n- How it can fail: If the path-closing lemma were false or incorrectly applied (e.g., wrong pairing indices), or if G' were assumed Hamiltonian only via a cycle that cannot be converted, the equivalence would fail. Lemma 4 prevents this.\n- Quick test: In K_{3,3}, pick two same-side vertices u,v; deg(u)+deg(v)=6=n. K_{3,3} is Hamiltonian, and so are all supergraphs including the extra edge uv; closure preserves Hamiltonicity both ways.\n\nCorollary 6 (Dirac via closure)\n- Statement: If \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2, then G is Hamiltonian.\n- Proof idea: For any nonedge uv of G, deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n. By Lemma 5, adding any such nonedge preserves Hamiltonicity equivalence. Iteratively add all nonedges; degrees only increase, so the precondition remains true throughout. The process ends at K_n, which is Hamiltonian for n \u2265 3. Therefore, the original G is Hamiltonian.\n- Why useful here: This is a compact, auditable route to Dirac\u2019s theorem using only Lemma 4.\n- How it can fail: Must ensure we can indeed add all nonedges; but the premise deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n holds for every nonedge at the start (since \u03b4 \u2265 n/2), and only improves as we add edges. Another pitfall is n=2; our standing assumption n \u2265 3 avoids it. Finally, we used that K_n is Hamiltonian (trivial for n \u2265 3).\n- Quick tests:\n  - n=4: \u03b4 \u2265 2. All such graphs are Hamiltonian; e.g., C_4, K_4 minus any matching, etc.\n  - n=6: \u03b4 \u2265 3. Examples like K_{3,3} (bipartite) and the cocktail-party graph CP_3 (K_6 minus a perfect matching; \u03b4=4) are Hamiltonian.\n\nSharpness of the bound\n- Even n: K_{n/2\u22121, n/2+1} is connected, non-Hamiltonian (bipartite parts unequal), and has \u03b4 = n/2\u22121. Shows \u03b4 \u2265 n/2\u22121 does not suffice.\n- Odd n: K_{(n\u22121)/2, (n+1)/2} is connected, non-Hamiltonian, with \u03b4 = (n\u22121)/2 = \u230an/2\u230b < n/2. Again, threshold n/2 is tight.\n- How it can fail: One might mistakenly cite K_{n/2,n/2} as a counterexample at the boundary; but balanced complete bipartite graphs K_{m,m} are Hamiltonian for m \u2265 2 (they have many 2-factors that are cycles of length 2m).\n- Quick test: K_{2,4} (n=6) has \u03b4=2 = n/2\u22121 and is not Hamiltonian (unequal bipartition), as expected.\n\nNotes on earlier misconceptions and corrections\n- Disconnected counterexamples under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 do not exist: Claim 1 already forbids disconnectedness and cut-vertices. Any attempt to refute Dirac by a disconnected graph violates \u03b4 \u2265 n/2.\n\nSummary of where we are\n- We have given a clean, self-contained path-closing lemma (Lemma 4), the single-edge closure equivalence (Lemma 5), and the short derivation of Dirac via iterative closure (Corollary 6). We also established basic structure (2-connectivity) and recorded sharpness examples. The remaining work is presentation polish (LaTeX writeup), and optionally an alternative direct proof via longest-path rotations (P\u00f3sa/Ore-style) for redundancy.\n",
