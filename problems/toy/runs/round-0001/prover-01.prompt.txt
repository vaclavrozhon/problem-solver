--- SYSTEM ---
You are a research mathematician. 

You are being run in a loop with a verifier that checks rigor. Your goal is to make **incremental, auditable progress**. You are not expected to solve the problem at once, but to generate new, testable ideas.

Inputs: 
- task statement 
- notes.md (summary of past progress; optional) 
- outputs.md (rigorously proven results curated so far; optional) 
- summary of past rounds (optional) 
- possibly some reference papers.

What counts as progress:
- Extract small lemmas/heuristics from literature and state them cleanly with one-line "why useful here".
- Explore small examples & try to break your own claims with toy counterexamples.
- Prove special cases or nontrivial bounds.
- If an approach fails, explain crisply why.
- Point out flaws in notes.md or outputs.md (but do not rewrite outputs.md yourself).

**Discipline.** 
- Read notes, outputs, summaries carefully before proposing new work. 
- Reference papers if relevant, but focus on *incremental, checkable steps*. 
- Do not output Markdown code fences, only raw JSON. 
- Length: at least ~200 words. 
- Organize your reasoning with short headings (Ideas, Examples, Obstacles, Next steps), make clear what your claims are and how they are supported. 
- Remember: the verifier curates notes and outputs, you only suggest.

**Return strictly JSON**:
{
  "progress_md": "Your progress notes for this round in Markdown (KaTeX allowed). Point out any gaps in outputs.md clearly. Do not modify outputs.md directly."

In this round, we explored Dirac's Theorem, which states that a graph with at least 3 vertices is Hamiltonian if every vertex has a degree of at least n/2. However, we identified limitations, including counterexamples where graphs with minimum degree ≥ n/2 are not Hamiltonian, particularly in disconnected graphs. A special case for n=3 was validated, but it does not generalize. The general approach to constructing Hamiltonian cycles from graphs with minimum degree ≥ n/2 requires further exploration and lacks rigor.

Round 0001 fixes the setting (finite, simple, undirected graphs, n ≥ 3) and corrects the earlier misconception: δ(G) ≥ n/2 forces connectivity and in fact 2‑connectivity, so disconnected/cut‑vertex counterexamples are impossible. The prover records and (mostly) proves standard lemmas: connectivity from δ ≥ n/2; sharpness via K_{n/2−1, n/2+1} (or the odd‑n variant); a longest‑path lower bound (there is a path of length ≥ δ+1); and the Bondy–Chvátal single‑edge closure step (if uv is a nonedge with deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, then adding uv preserves Hamiltonicity) proved by a pigeonhole argument along a Hamiltonian path. Iterating the closure yields K_n under δ ≥ n/2, hence Dirac's theorem follows. The verifier flags and corrects one minor error about K_{n/2,n/2} closure. Remaining work is a full formal writeup of the iterative closure (or an optional Ore/longest‑path alternative) and a final LaTeXized proof.

In Round 0001, the focus was on establishing the conditions under which a simple, undirected graph with minimum degree δ(G) ≥ n/2 is Hamiltonian, as per Dirac's theorem. Key lemmas were developed, including connectivity implications, sharpness of the degree bound, and a longest path lower bound. The Bondy–Chvátal closure theorem was introduced as a critical step in proving Hamiltonicity, with a corollary linking it to Dirac's theorem. Special cases were examined, including the case of a cycle of length n−1, and counterexamples were explored to reinforce the established conditions. The round concluded with a plan for a full formal writeup and potential alternative proofs.



=== notes.md ===
- Adopt closure-based proof as the primary route to Dirac: (1) prove path-closing lemma from a Hamiltonian path under deg-sum ≥ n; (2) deduce single-edge equivalence; (3) iterate to K_n under δ ≥ n/2.
- Normalize indexing to x0,…,x_{n−1} with u = x0, v = x_{n−1}. State and use A = {i∈{1,…,n−2}: u~x_i} and B = {i∈{2,…,n−1}: v~x_{i−1}} with |A| = deg(u), |B| = deg(v).
- Include short proofs of connectivity and 2-connectivity under δ ≥ n/2; include sharpness examples K_{k−1,k+1} and K_{k,k+1}; state n ≥ 3 up front.
- Optional appendix: direct Pósa/Ore-style proof; keep the ‘two common neighbors’ claim there if used.
