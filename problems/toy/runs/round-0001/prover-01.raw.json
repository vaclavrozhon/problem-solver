Note and use the immediate consequence δ ≥ n/2 ⇒ every nonedge uv satisfies deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n.\\n- Prove two basic structural lemmas under δ ≥ n/2: (i) connectivity and (ii) 2-connectivity. Why useful: rules out trivial counterexamples and enables path/cycle splicing arguments.\\n- Prove a path-closing lemma (pigeonhole on a Hamiltonian path between u and v with deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n). Why useful: this is the key single-step Bondy–Chvátal closure move.\\n- Derive the single-edge closure equivalence (G is Hamiltonian iff G+uv is Hamiltonian when deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n).\\n- Conclude Dirac via iterating closure to K_n; record sharpness examples and sanity checks; flag pitfalls.\\n\\nSetup and standing assumptions\\n- All graphs are finite, simple, undirected; |V(G)| = n ≥ 3. δ(G) denotes minimum degree. “Hamiltonian” = containing a cycle through all n vertices.\\n- Target statement (Dirac): If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then G is Hamiltonian.\\n- Immediate observation: If δ(G) ≥ n/2 and uv is a nonedge, then deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n.\\n\\nClaim 1 (Connectivity and 2-connectivity from δ ≥ n/2)\\n- Statement: If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then G is connected and has no cut-vertex (i.e., G is 2-connected).\\n- Sketch proof:\\n  - Connectivity: Suppose G has ≥ 2 components, with sizes a and b ≥ 1 and a+b ≤ n. Any vertex in the component of size a has degree ≤ a−1, contradicting δ ≥ n/2 unless a−1 ≥ n/2. But then a ≥ n/2+1 and similarly b ≥ n/2+1, so a+b ≥ n+2, impossible. Thus G is connected.\\n  - No cut-vertex: Suppose v is a cut-vertex, so G−v has ≥ 2 components A, B with sizes a = |A|, b = |B| and a+b = n−1. Pick u ∈ A. Then N(u) ⊆ (A−{u}) ∪ {v}, so deg(u) ≤ (a−1)+1 = a. By δ ≥ n/2 we get a ≥ n/2. Similarly b ≥ n/2. Then a+b ≥ n, contradicting a+b = n−1. Hence no cut-vertex.\\n- Why useful here: longest-path/closure arguments typically need at least connectivity; 2-connectivity prevents trivial obstructions and aligns with Hamiltonicity.\\n- How it can fail: For n small (e.g., n=2) statements are false/trivial; we assumed n ≥ 3. For the cut-vertex part, we used the easy bound deg(u) ≤ a; the only way around is if some u had neighbors outside A∪{v}, but that’s impossible by definition of components of G−v.\\n- Quick test: n=6, δ ≥ 3. Try to engineer a cut vertex. If G−v had components of sizes 3 and 2, then a=3, b=2 fail b ≥ n/2=3. Contradiction as expected.\\n\\nClaim 2 (Two common neighbors from a large degree sum)\\n- Statement: If u,v are nonadjacent and deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, then |N(u) ∩ N(v)| ≥ 2.\\n- Proof: N(u), N(v) ⊆ V \\\\ {u,v}, so |N(u) ∪ N(v)| ≤ n−2. Inclusion–exclusion gives |N(u) ∩ N(v)| = deg(u)+deg(v) − |N(u) ∪ N(v)| ≥ deg(u)+deg(v) − (n−2) ≥ 2.\\n- Why useful here: shows abundance of overlaps; often used to pivot/rotate paths and to rule out local obstructions.\\n- How it can fail: If we mistakenly allowed loops or multiple edges or counted u ∈ N(u), v ∈ N(v), the bound breaks; but in simple graphs, neighborhoods exclude the vertex itself.\\n- Quick test: In K_{m,m} with n=2m, any two nonadjacent vertices lie in the same part and have exactly m common neighbors; lower bound 2 is satisfied for m ≥ 2.\\n\\nClaim 3 (Longest path lower bound)\\n- Statement: Every graph has a path on at least δ(G)+1 vertices.\\n- Proof: Let P be a longest path with endpoints x,y. Then all neighbors of x lie on P, so deg(x) ≤ |P|−1. Hence |P| ≥ deg(x)+1 ≥ δ+1.\\n- Why useful here: sanity check on reachability; under δ ≥ n/2 this already yields a path of length ≥ n/2+1, a mild step toward Hamiltonicity.\\n- How it can fail: If we allowed infinite graphs or directed edges, the statement needs modification; here finite and undirected suffices.\\n- Quick test: For C_5 (δ=2) the longest path has length 3 (i.e., 3 vertices), consistent with δ+1=3.\\n\\nLemma 4 (Path-closing lemma; pigeonhole on a Hamiltonian path)\\n- Statement: Let G be a graph on n vertices. Let P = x_0, x_1, ..., x_{n-1} be a Hamiltonian path in G with endpoints x_0 = u and x_{n-1} = v, and suppose uv is not an edge. If deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, then G has a Hamiltonian cycle.\\n- Proof: Consider index set I = {1,2,...,n−1}. Define\\n  - A = { i ∈ I : u is adjacent to x_i } so |A| = deg(u) (all neighbors of u lie among x_1,...,x_{n−1}).\\n  - B = { i ∈ I : v is adjacent to x_{i−1} } so |B| = deg(v) (neighbors of v lie among x_0,...,x_{n−2}).\\n  Then A,B ⊆ I and |A|+|B| ≥ n = |I|+1, hence A ∩ B ≠ ∅. Take i ∈ A ∩ B. Edges ux_i and v x_{i−1} are present. The following closed walk is a Hamiltonian cycle:\\n  u = x_0, x_1, ..., x_i, then jump via ux_i back to u? No—use the chords in the order that preserves simplicity:\\n  Construct the cycle\\n  u — x_i — x_{i+1} — ... — x_{n−1}(=v) — x_{i−1} — x_{i−2} — ... — x_1 — u,\\n  where the edges used are: ux_i (by choice i ∈ A), the path edges x_j x_{j+1} for j = i,...,n−2, the chord v x_{i−1} (by choice i ∈ B), and the path edges x_{j} x_{j−1} for j = i−1,...,1. This visits every x_j exactly once and returns to u, hence is a Hamiltonian cycle.\\n- Why useful here: This is the combinatorial heart of the Bondy–Chvátal single-edge closure step.\\n- How it can fail: The indexing must avoid using uv; that’s why B is defined with predecessors x_{i−1}. A common pitfall is to pair u with x_i and v with x_{i+1}; that pairing does not directly yield a simple cycle without repetition.\\n- Quick test: Take n=6, a Hamiltonian path P = (u,a,b,c,d,v) with deg(u)=deg(v)=3. If uv ∉ E, then A = {indices of neighbors of u} and B = {indices whose predecessors neighbor v} both have size 3 in I={1,...,5}; intersection exists, e.g., i=3 could work (u—c and v—b), and the cycle is u—c—d—v—b—a—u.\\n\\nLemma 5 (Single-edge closure equivalence; Bondy–Chvátal step)\\n- Statement: Let G be a graph on n vertices and u,v nonadjacent with deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n. Then G is Hamiltonian iff G' = G + uv is Hamiltonian.\\n- Proof: “Only if” is trivial. For “if”, assume G' has a Hamiltonian cycle. If that cycle does not use uv, it lies in G and we are done. Otherwise, delete edge uv from the cycle; what remains is a Hamiltonian path in G from u to v. By Lemma 4, G then has a Hamiltonian cycle.\\n- Why useful here: This makes adding edges with large degree sum a Hamiltonicity-preserving operation.\\n- How it can fail: If the path-closing lemma were false or incorrectly applied (e.g., wrong pairing indices), or if G' were assumed Hamiltonian only via a cycle that cannot be converted, the equivalence would fail. Lemma 4 prevents this.\\n- Quick test: In K_{3,3}, pick two same-side vertices u,v; deg(u)+deg(v)=6=n. K_{3,3} is Hamiltonian, and so are all supergraphs including the extra edge uv; closure preserves Hamiltonicity both ways.\\n\\nCorollary 6 (Dirac via closure)\\n- Statement: If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then G is Hamiltonian.\\n- Proof idea: For any nonedge uv of G, deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n. By Lemma 5, adding any such nonedge preserves Hamiltonicity equivalence. Iteratively add all nonedges; degrees only increase, so the precondition remains true throughout. The process ends at K_n, which is Hamiltonian for n ≥ 3. Therefore, the original G is Hamiltonian.\\n- Why useful here: This is a compact, auditable route to Dirac’s theorem using only Lemma 4.\\n- How it can fail: Must ensure we can indeed add all nonedges; but the premise deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n holds for every nonedge at the start (since δ ≥ n/2), and only improves as we add edges. Another pitfall is n=2; our standing assumption n ≥ 3 avoids it. Finally, we used that K_n is Hamiltonian (trivial for n ≥ 3).\\n- Quick tests:\\n  - n=4: δ ≥ 2. All such graphs are Hamiltonian; e.g., C_4, K_4 minus any matching, etc.\\n  - n=6: δ ≥ 3. Examples like K_{3,3} (bipartite) and the cocktail-party graph CP_3 (K_6 minus a perfect matching; δ=4) are Hamiltonian.\\n\\nSharpness of the bound\\n- Even n: K_{n/2−1, n/2+1} is connected, non-Hamiltonian (bipartite parts unequal), and has δ = n/2−1. Shows δ ≥ n/2−1 does not suffice.\\n- Odd n: K_{(n−1)/2, (n+1)/2} is connected, non-Hamiltonian, with δ = (n−1)/2 = ⌊n/2⌋ < n/2. Again, threshold n/2 is tight.\\n- How it can fail: One might mistakenly cite K_{n/2,n/2} as a counterexample at the boundary; but balanced complete bipartite graphs K_{m,m} are Hamiltonian for m ≥ 2 (they have many 2-factors that are cycles of length 2m).\\n- Quick test: K_{2,4} (n=6) has δ=2 = n/2−1 and is not Hamiltonian (unequal bipartition), as expected.\\n\\nNotes on earlier misconceptions and corrections\\n- Disconnected counterexamples under δ ≥ n/2 do not exist: Claim 1 already forbids disconnectedness and cut-vertices. Any attempt to refute Dirac by a disconnected graph violates δ ≥ n/2.\\n\\nSummary of where we are\\n- We have given a clean, self-contained path-closing lemma (Lemma 4), the single-edge closure equivalence (Lemma 5), and the short derivation of Dirac via iterative closure (Corollary 6). We also established basic structure (2-connectivity) and recorded sharpness examples.
