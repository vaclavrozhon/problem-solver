I also flag small technical points to watch (endpoints, index ranges, n ≥ 3).\\n\\nPlan (closure route to Dirac)\\n- Prove the path-closing lemma: a Hamiltonian path with endpoints u,v and deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n closes to a Hamiltonian cycle. Why useful: it is the local engine for the Bondy–Chvátal single-edge step.\\n- Deduce the single-edge closure equivalence: adding a nonedge uv with deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n preserves Hamiltonicity (iff). Why useful: allows iterative augmentation without changing Hamiltonicity.\\n- Under δ(G) ≥ n/2, every nonedge has deg-sum ≥ n, so the iterative closure yields K_n; therefore G is Hamiltonian. Why useful: completes Dirac’s theorem.\\n- Record connectivity and 2-connectivity consequences of δ ≥ n/2 and sharpness examples. Why useful: prevents false counterexamples and documents optimality of the bound.\\n\\nSetting\\n- All graphs are finite, simple, undirected; n = |V(G)| ≥ 3. Write δ(G) for the minimum degree.\\n\\nLemma 1 (Connectivity from δ ≥ n/2)\\n- Claim: If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then G is connected.\\n- Proof: If G were disconnected, let C be a smallest component, |C| = s. Each v ∈ C has deg(v) ≤ s − 1. If s ≤ n/2 then deg(v) ≤ s − 1 ≤ n/2 − 1 < n/2, contradicting δ ≥ n/2. Hence s ≥ n/2 + 1, but two disjoint components then have ≥ (n/2 + 1) + (n/2 + 1) > n vertices, impossible. ∎\\n\\nLemma 2 (2-connectivity from δ ≥ n/2)\\n- Claim: If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then G has no cut-vertex.\\n- Proof: Suppose w is a cut-vertex. Let the components of G − w be H_1,…,H_t with t ≥ 2, and let s = min_i |V(H_i)|. For any x ∈ V(H_i) (the smallest one), x has neighbors only in H_i and possibly w, hence deg(x) ≤ (s − 1) + 1 = s. Also s ≤ (n − 1)/2, so deg(x) ≤ (n − 1)/2 < n/2, contradicting δ ≥ n/2. ∎\\n\\nLemma 3 (Path-closing lemma)\\n- Statement: Let G have a Hamiltonian path P = x_0 x_1 … x_{n−1} with endpoints u = x_0 and v = x_{n−1}. If uv ∉ E(G) and deg(u) + deg(v) ≥ n, then G has a Hamiltonian cycle.\\n- Proof (indexing per notes): Define\\n  A = { i ∈ {1,…,n−2} : u is adjacent to x_i },\\n  B = { i ∈ {2,…,n−1} : v is adjacent to x_{i−1} }.\\n  Because uv ∉ E(G), every neighbor of u lies among {x_1,…,x_{n−2}}, so |A| = deg(u). Likewise, every neighbor of v lies among {x_1,…,x_{n−2}}, so |B| = deg(v) (via the shift i ↦ i − 1).\\n  For each i ∈ {1,…,n−2}, we cannot have both edges u x_i and v x_{i−1}, because then the cycle\\n  x_0(=u) — x_i — x_{i+1} — … — x_{n−1}(=v) — x_{i−1} — x_{i−2} — … — x_1 — x_0\\n  would be a Hamiltonian cycle in G already. Equivalently, A and B′ := {i − 1 : i ∈ B} are disjoint subsets of {1,…,n−2}. Hence |A| + |B′| ≤ n − 2. But |B′| = |B|, so deg(u) + deg(v) = |A| + |B| = |A| + |B′| ≤ n − 2, contradicting deg(u) + deg(v) ≥ n. Therefore some i has both edges present, giving the Hamiltonian cycle as displayed. ∎\\n- Why useful: This is the core combinatorial step ensuring we can remove a “closure edge” from a Hamiltonian cycle and still recover Hamiltonicity in the original graph.\\n\\nLemma 4 (Single-edge closure equivalence)\\n- Statement: Let uv ∉ E(G) with deg(u) + deg(v) ≥ n, and let G′ = G + uv. Then G is Hamiltonian iff G′ is Hamiltonian.\\n- Proof: If G is Hamiltonian then so is its supergraph G′. Conversely, suppose G′ has a Hamiltonian cycle C. If C does not use uv, then C ⊆ G and we are done. If C uses uv, delete uv from C to obtain a Hamiltonian path P of G with endpoints u and v. Apply Lemma 3 to P and deg(u) + deg(v) ≥ n to conclude that G has a Hamiltonian cycle. ∎\\n- Why useful: Allows iterative addition of edges with deg-sum ≥ n without changing Hamiltonicity.\\n\\nLemma 5 (Closure to K_n under δ ≥ n/2)\\n- Claim: If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then for every nonadjacent pair {u,v}, deg(u) + deg(v) ≥ n. Consequently, adding all such nonedges yields K_n.\\n- Proof: δ(G) ≥ n/2 implies deg(u) ≥ n/2 and deg(v) ≥ n/2 for all u,v, so the sum is ≥ n. Add any nonedge uv; degrees only increase, so at any stage every remaining nonedge still has deg-sum ≥ n. Adding all of them produces a complete graph. ∎\\n- Why useful: Reduces Dirac to the trivial Hamiltonicity of K_n.\\n\\nTheorem (Dirac)\\n- Statement: For n ≥ 3, every graph G with δ(G) ≥ n/2 is Hamiltonian.\\n- Proof: Iteratively add nonedges with deg-sum ≥ n to obtain K_n (Lemma 5). By Lemma 4, Hamiltonicity is preserved at each addition, so G is Hamiltonian iff K_n is, and K_n is Hamiltonian for n ≥ 3. ∎\\n\\nSharpness and examples\\n- Even n = 2k: The complete bipartite graph K_{k−1, k+1} has δ = k − 1 = n/2 − 1 and is not Hamiltonian (unbalanced bipartite graphs have no spanning cycle). Shows the bound cannot be lowered below n/2.\\n- Odd n = 2k + 1: K_{k, k+1} has δ = k = ⌊n/2⌋ and is not Hamiltonian (all cycles are even in bipartite graphs). Shows replacing n/2 by ⌊n/2⌋ would be false.\\n\\nChecks and potential pitfalls\\n- n ≥ 3 is essential: for n = 2, δ ≥ n/2 = 1 gives K_2, which has no Hamiltonian cycle in simple graphs (no 2-cycles). Our theorem correctly excludes n = 2.\\n- Indexing in Lemma 3 carefully avoids referring to uv by restricting A to 1,…,n−2 and using the shifted B. The disjointness is proved on A and B′.\\n- Closure of K_{n/2, n/2} is indeed K_n: nonedges lie within parts, and each such pair has deg-sum = n, so all are added. No contradiction with Dirac (K_{n/2,n/2} itself is Hamiltonian for n ≥ 4).\\n\\nAlternative route (for appendix)\\n- One can also derive Dirac via Ore’s theorem (if deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n for all nonadjacent u,v, then G is Hamiltonian), which in turn follows by the same single-edge closure lemma without fully iterating to K_n. Or via Pósa’s rotation-extension method plus a longest-path argument. These are optional and not needed for the main proof.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Curate Lemmas 1–5 and the Dirac theorem proof into outputs.md with explicit statements and proofs as above.\\n- Optionally add a brief note on 2-connectivity corollary and the sharpness examples.\\n- If desired, include a short Ore-style proof as an appendix for completeness.\"}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"auto","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"ProverOutput","schema_":{"properties":{"progress_md":{"description":"Append-only progress notes","title":"Progress Md","type":"string"}},"required":["progress_md"],"title":"ProverOutput","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":1556,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":10631,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":8640},"total_tokens":12187},"user":null,"store":true}
