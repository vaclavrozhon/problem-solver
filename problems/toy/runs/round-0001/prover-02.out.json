Interpret \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2 as \u03b4(G) \u2265 ceil(n/2) since degrees are integers.\n\nClaim 0. If n \u2264 2, the statement every graph with minimum degree \u2265 n/2 is Hamiltonian is false. Why useful here: Ensures we restrict to the standard n \u2265 3 regime of Dirac's theorem.\n- Proof sketch: For n = 1, \u03b4 = 0 \u2265 1/2, but there is no cycle of length 1 in standard conventions. For n = 2, K2 has \u03b4 = 1 = n/2 but has no cycle of length 2 in simple graphs.\n- How it can fail: If one adopts a nonstandard convention allowing a 2-cycle or loop, the statement might change; we exclude such conventions.\n- Quick test: K2 has \u03b4 = 1 \u2265 1 = n/2 but is not Hamiltonian. So we impose n \u2265 3 in the task.\n\nClaim 1. \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2 implies G is connected. Why useful here: Rules out disconnected counterexamples and supports later longest-path arguments.\n- Proof sketch: If G were disconnected with components of sizes a and n \u2212 a, then every vertex in the smaller component has degree at most a \u2212 1 \u2264 n/2 \u2212 1, contradicting \u03b4 \u2265 n/2.\n- How it can fail: If one weakens \u03b4 to \u2265 (n \u2212 1)/2, disconnected graphs can exist.\n- Quick test: Take n = 2k + 1 and G = K_k \u222a K_{k+1}. Then \u03b4 = k \u2212 1 = (n \u2212 3)/2 and G is disconnected; indeed \u03b4 < n/2.\n\nClaim 2. \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2 implies G is 2-connected (no cut-vertex). Why useful here: Prevents cut-vertex obstructions to extending cycles/paths and is a standard strengthening in the Dirac range.\n- Proof sketch: Suppose v is a cut-vertex. Then G \u2212 v has components A, B with |A| = a, |B| = b and a + b = n \u2212 1. For any u \u2208 A, all neighbors of u lie in A \u222a {v}, so deg(u) \u2264 (a \u2212 1) + 1 = a. Hence \u03b4 \u2264 min(a, b) \u2264 floor((n \u2212 1)/2) < n/2, contradiction.\n- How it can fail: If \u03b4 is only \u2265 floor(n/2), there are graphs with cut-vertices; for example, join a high-degree vertex to two dense blocks whose sizes are imbalanced.\n- Quick test: n = 6, suppose a cut splits into a = 2, b = 3. Then any u in the a-side has degree \u2264 2 < n/2 = 3; so \u03b4 \u2265 3 forbids a cut-vertex, consistent with the claim.\n\nClaim 3. Longest-path lower bound: every graph has a path with at least \u03b4(G) + 1 vertices. Why useful here: A standard baseline for rotation\u2013extension and path-to-cycle arguments; also a sanity check that \u03b4-scale phenomena reach linear size.\n- Proof sketch: Let P be a longest path with endpoint x. If a neighbor of x were outside P, we could extend P, contradiction. Thus all neighbors of x lie on P, so P contains x together with all deg(x) neighbors, giving |P| \u2265 deg(x) + 1 \u2265 \u03b4 + 1.\n- How it can fail: The analogous claim for cycles, length \u2265 \u03b4 + 1, is false in general; we only assert it for paths.\n- Quick test: In a star K_{1,m}, \u03b4 = 1 and indeed there is a path with 2 vertices; equality holds.\n\nClaim 4. Bondy\u2013Chv\u00e1tal single-edge closure step. Let u, v be nonadjacent vertices with deg(u) + deg(v) \u2265 n. Then G is Hamiltonian if and only if G + uv is Hamiltonian. Why useful here: It is the engine for the closure method; iterating it under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 will complete G to K_n without changing Hamiltonicity.\n- Proof sketch: The forward direction is trivial. For the backward direction, assume G + uv has a Hamiltonian cycle C. If C avoids edge uv, then C \u2286 G and we are done. Otherwise, delete edge uv from C to obtain a Hamiltonian path P in G from u to v, say P: x_1 = u, x_2, ..., x_n = v.\n  For i = 1, ..., n \u2212 1, consider the consecutive pair (x_i, x_{i+1}). Define S = {i \u2208 {1, ..., n \u2212 1} : u is adjacent to x_{i+1} in G} and T = {i \u2208 {1, ..., n \u2212 1} : v is adjacent to x_i in G}. Because P contains all vertices, the neighbors of u (resp. v) correspond bijectively to indices in S (resp. T), so |S| = deg(u), |T| = deg(v). If S and T were disjoint, then |S| + |T| \u2264 n \u2212 1, contradicting deg(u) + deg(v) \u2265 n. Hence there exists i with i \u2208 S \u2229 T, meaning u is adjacent to x_{i+1} and v is adjacent to x_i. Then the cycle u, x_{i+1}, x_{i+2}, ..., v, x_i, x_{i\u22121}, ..., x_1 = u is a Hamiltonian cycle in G avoiding uv. Thus G is Hamiltonian.\n- How it can fail: The degree-sum threshold is tight for this argument; if deg(u) + deg(v) \u2264 n \u2212 1, the sets S and T can be disjoint and the splice may be impossible.\n- Quick test: Let G be the path P4 on vertices 1\u22122\u22123\u22124. Then deg(1) + deg(4) = 2 < n = 4. G is not Hamiltonian, but G + 14 is Hamiltonian (C4). This does not contradict the lemma because the degree-sum condition fails.\n\nClaim 5. Under \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2, the closure cl(G) obtained by repeatedly adding nonedges uv with deg(u) + deg(v) \u2265 n is the complete graph K_n. Why useful here: Reduces Dirac to the trivial fact that K_n is Hamiltonian.\n- Proof sketch: Since deg(u) \u2265 n/2 and deg(v) \u2265 n/2 for all vertices, every nonedge uv already satisfies deg(u) + deg(v) \u2265 n in the original graph. Thus we may add every missing edge; degrees only increase, so the condition remains satisfied throughout. Eventually all missing edges are added and cl(G) = K_n.\n- How it can fail: If we only had \u03b4 \u2265 floor(n/2), then for some nonedges uv, the sum deg(u) + deg(v) could be n \u2212 1, and the closure may stop before reaching K_n.\n- Quick test: n = 6, \u03b4 \u2265 3. Any nonedge uv has deg(u) + deg(v) \u2265 6, so it is added. After processing all, we indeed get K6.\n\nClaim 6. Dirac via closure. If n \u2265 3 and \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2, then G is Hamiltonian. Why useful here: This directly addresses the task.\n- Proof sketch: By Claim 5, cl(G) = K_n. By Claim 4 applied at each added edge, Hamiltonicity is preserved during closure. K_n is Hamiltonian for n \u2265 3 (cycle through the vertices), hence so is G.\n- How it can fail: Only if an intermediate application of Claim 4 were invalid; but the degree-sum hypothesis holds for every added edge throughout, so the chain is valid.\n- Quick test: n = 5, \u03b4 \u2265 3. For instance, take K5 minus two disjoint edges; \u03b4 = 3. Closure adds back both missing edges, reaching K5, hence G is Hamiltonian; indeed one sees a 5-cycle directly.\n\nClaim 7. Sharpness of the bound. The threshold \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 cannot be lowered in general.\n- Proof sketch: Even n = 2k: G = K_{k\u22121, k+1} has \u03b4 = k \u2212 1 = n/2 \u2212 1 and is not Hamiltonian because a bipartite Hamiltonian cycle would have to alternate perfectly between the two parts, which is impossible when part sizes are unequal. Odd n = 2k + 1: G = K_{k, k+1} has \u03b4 = k = floor(n/2) = ceil(n/2) \u2212 1 and is not Hamiltonian because any cycle in a bipartite graph has even length, but n is odd.\n- How it can fail: One might mistakenly cite K_{k,k} at n = 2k as a counterexample; but K_{k,k} is Hamiltonian (indeed 2-factorable), and in fact meets the Dirac bound with equality.\n- Quick test: n = 6, K_{2,4} has \u03b4 = 2 = n/2 \u2212 1 and is not Hamiltonian; n = 7, K_{3,4} has \u03b4 = 3 = floor(7/2) and is not Hamiltonian.\n\nSanity checks on small n\n- n = 3: \u03b4 \u2265 2 forces G = K3, Hamiltonian.\n- n = 4: \u03b4 \u2265 2. Examples: C4 (Hamiltonian), K4 minus a matching (Hamiltonian). No counterexamples exist.\n- n = 5: \u03b4 \u2265 3. Example: K5 minus two disjoint edges, Hamiltonian. Balanced bipartite K_{2,3} has \u03b4 = 2 < 3 and is not Hamiltonian, consistent.\n\nAlternative direct Dirac-style proof skeleton (for later writeup)\n- Assume G not Hamiltonian and let C be a longest cycle of length c. Then there exists a vertex w outside C. Show that w has at least two neighbors on C at distance at least 2 apart along C using \u03b4 \u2265 n/2, and splice to form a longer cycle, contradicting maximality. This approach avoids closure and uses rotation\u2013extension; to be completed in a polished writeup if desired.\n\nStatus\n- We now have a complete, local-lemma-based proof pipeline (via Bondy\u2013Chv\u00e1tal closure) with explicit lemmas and checks, and examples showing the bound is tight.\n",
