  "progress_md": "Status and gaps\n- outputs.md was not provided in this round, so I cannot audit what has been formally curated. From the summaries/notes, the planned closure-based proof is the right route, but key steps still need fully written, checkable proofs: (i) the path-closing lemma on a Hamiltonian path under a degree-sum condition; (ii) the single-edge closure equivalence; (iii) the iteration to K_n under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2; and (iv) brief proofs of connectivity and 2-connectivity under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2. I supply clean statements and proofs below, aligned with the indexing convention in notes.md, and note any delicate points.\n\nSetup\n- Graphs are finite, simple, undirected; n = |V(G)| \u2265 3. A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle through all n vertices.\n- Dirac\u2019s theorem target: If \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2, then G is Hamiltonian. This resolves the task in the affirmative.\n\nIdeas (plan of attack)\n- Use Bondy\u2013Chv\u00e1tal-style single-edge closure: nonedge uv with deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n is \u201csafe\u201d to add w.r.t. Hamiltonicity (equivalence). Prove via the path-closing lemma along a Hamiltonian path obtained by removing uv from a Hamiltonian cycle in G+uv.\n- Under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2, every nonedge satisfies the degree-sum condition, so iterating the closure adds all missing edges and yields K_n. Since equivalence holds at each step and K_n is Hamiltonian, G is Hamiltonian.\n- Add short lemmas: \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 implies connected and indeed 2-connected; sharpness examples at \u03b4 = \u2308n/2\u2309\u22121.\n\nKey lemmas with proofs (auditable)\n1) Connectivity and 2\u2011connectivity from \u03b4 \u2265 n/2\n- Claim (connectivity): If \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2, G is connected.\n  Proof sketch: If disconnected with components of sizes a \u2264 b, then any vertex in the smaller component has degree \u2264 a\u22121 \u2264 \u230a(n\u22121)/2\u230b < n/2, contradiction.\n- Claim (2\u2011connectivity): If \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2, G has no cut-vertex.\n  Proof sketch: Suppose x is a cut-vertex, and G\u2212x has components of sizes p \u2264 q with p+q = n\u22121. Any vertex u in the smaller component has deg(u) \u2264 (p\u22121)+1 = p \u2264 \u230a(n\u22121)/2\u230b < n/2, contradiction.\n  Why useful: Removes earlier misconception about disconnected counterexamples; ensures robust structure for Hamiltonicity arguments.\n\n2) Path\u2011closing lemma (notes.md indexing)\n- Statement: Let G be on n vertices and let P = x_0, x_1, \u2026, x_{n\u22121} be a Hamiltonian path with endpoints u = x_0 and v = x_{n\u22121}. If deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n, then G has a Hamiltonian cycle.\n- Proof: If uv \u2208 E(G), we are done. Assume uv \u2209 E(G). Define\n  A = { i \u2208 {1,\u2026,n\u22122} : u is adjacent to x_i },\n  B = { i \u2208 {2,\u2026,n\u22121} : v is adjacent to x_{i\u22121} }.\n  Because P spans all vertices and uv \u2209 E, we have |A| = deg(u) and |B| = deg(v) (the indexing omits the impossible end-neighbor). Suppose, for contradiction, that A \u2229 B = \u2205. Then, for each i \u2208 {2,\u2026,n\u22122}, at most one of the adjacencies u\u223cx_i or v\u223cx_{i\u22121} holds; also, i=1 can contribute to A only and i=n\u22121 can contribute to B only. Hence |A|+|B| \u2264 (n\u22123)+1+1 = n\u22121. Therefore deg(u)+deg(v) \u2264 n\u22121, contradicting the hypothesis deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n. Thus A \u2229 B \u2260 \u2205; choose i \u2208 A \u2229 B. Then u\u223cx_i and v\u223cx_{i\u22121}, and the cycle u, x_i, x_{i+1}, \u2026, x_{n\u22121}(=v), x_{i\u22121}, x_{i\u22122}, \u2026, x_0(=u) uses edges of P plus the two chords and spans all vertices. So G is Hamiltonian. QED.\n  Why useful: This is the central combinatorial step used in closure proofs.\n\n3) Single\u2011edge closure equivalence\n- Statement: Let G be on n vertices and uv \u2209 E(G) with deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n. Then G is Hamiltonian iff G+uv is Hamiltonian.\n- Proof: \u201c\u21d2\u201d is trivial since adding edges preserves Hamiltonicity. For \u201c\u21d0\u201d, suppose G+uv has a Hamiltonian cycle. If the cycle avoids uv, it is a Hamiltonian cycle in G. If it uses uv, then removing uv yields a Hamiltonian path in G with endpoints u and v; apply the path\u2011closing lemma to conclude G is Hamiltonian. QED.\n  Why useful: Allows iterative addition of all \u201cOre-eligible\u201d nonedges while preserving Hamiltonicity equivalence.\n\n4) Iteration to K_n under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2\n- Observation: If \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2, then for any distinct u,v we have deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n. In particular, every nonedge uv meets the hypothesis of the single\u2011edge closure equivalence.\n- Iteration: Enumerate the nonedges uv_1, uv_2, \u2026 arbitrarily and add them one-by-one. At each addition, degrees do not decrease, so the degree\u2011sum condition remains valid for all remaining nonedges. By the equivalence lemma, Hamiltonicity is preserved both ways at each step. When all nonedges are added, the resulting graph is K_n, which is Hamiltonian for n \u2265 3. Hence the original G is Hamiltonian. QED (Dirac).\n  Why useful: Completes the closure route from \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 to Hamiltonicity.\n\n5) Sharpness examples (cannot lower the bound)\n- Even n = 2k: Let G = K_{k\u22121, k+1}. Then \u03b4(G) = k\u22121 = n/2 \u2212 1. Any Hamiltonian cycle in a bipartite graph must alternate parts, so it uses equal numbers from each part; since the parts have sizes k\u22121 and k+1, no Hamiltonian cycle exists. Shows the n/2 bound cannot be decreased.\n- Odd n = 2k+1: Let G = K_{k, k+1}. Then \u03b4(G) = k = \u230an/2\u230b < \u2308n/2\u2309. By parity/alternation, no Hamiltonian cycle exists (a Hamiltonian cycle would have even length n). Shows that replacing n/2 by \u230an/2\u230b fails.\n\nSmall auxiliary facts (optional but clean)\n- Diameter \u2264 2 under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2: For nonadjacent u,v, |N(u)|+|N(v)| \u2265 n, so they share a neighbor; hence dist(u,v) = 2. Not essential, but often used heuristically.\n- Longest path bound: Every graph has a path with at least \u03b4(G)+1 vertices. Proof: Let P be a longest path of length \u2113 (\u2113+1 vertices). An endpoint x has all neighbors on P, so deg(x) \u2264 \u2113. Hence \u2113 \u2265 \u03b4(G), giving \u2113+1 \u2265 \u03b4(G)+1. Not used in the closure route, but consistent with the summaries.\n\nExamples / sanity checks\n- n=3: \u03b4 \u2265 3/2 \u21d2 \u03b4 \u2265 2, so G = K_3, which is Hamiltonian. Base case aligns with Dirac.\n- Complete bipartite K_{n/2, n/2} (n even): \u03b4 = n/2; it is Hamiltonian (indeed has many Hamiltonian cycles). Under closure, every nonedge is within a part and gets added (degree-sum = n), ultimately giving K_n, consistent with the equivalence lemma.\n\nObstacles / delicate points to watch\n- Indexing in the path\u2011closing lemma: adhering to A = {1,\u2026,n\u22122} and B = {2,\u2026,n\u22121} avoids the trivial non-neighbor positions and makes |A|=deg(u), |B|=deg(v) precise. Any writeup should explicitly justify those equalities because they rely on P being Hamiltonian and uv \u2209 E.\n- Ensure the \u201cequivalence\u201d direction in the closure step is stated and proved; some expositions only show the forward implication, which is not enough for iteration by equivalence.\n\nNext steps (for outputs.md)\n- Add the fully written proofs of Lemmas 1\u20134 above, with the exact indexing as recorded here; this is a complete, rigorous closure-based proof of Dirac\u2019s theorem for n \u2265 3.\n- Include the 2-connectivity lemma and both sharpness examples, as brief propositions with proofs.\n- Optionally append an Ore/P\u00f3sa alternative proof for completeness (not needed for the main result).\n- Verify definitions section explicitly states the class of graphs and n \u2265 3 to avoid n=2 edge-case confusion.\n"
