  "summary_md": "Round summary: Prover-01 and Prover-02 supply a complete closure-based proof plan for Dirac's theorem (n = |V| \u2265 3). Key steps: prove the path-closing lemma for a Hamiltonian path P with endpoints u,v (if deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n then P closes to a Hamiltonian cycle); deduce the single-edge closure equivalence (adding a nonedge uv with deg-sum \u2265 n preserves Hamiltonicity both ways); iterate this safe addition under \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2 to obtain K_n and conclude G is Hamiltonian. Both provers also record supporting lemmas (\u03b4 \u2265 n/2 implies connected and 2\u2011connected), small technical checks on indexing/endpoints, and sharpness examples (K_{k\u22121,k+1} and K_{k,k+1}). Optional alternative routes (Ore or P\u00f3sa) are noted. outputs.md was not produced in this round; the Verifier reports success on the submitted summaries. Citations: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json, Verifier.",
  "highlights": [
    "Path-closing lemma: Given a Hamiltonian path P with endpoints u,v, if deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n then P extends to a Hamiltonian cycle (uses A/B indexing and a disjointness/counting contradiction).",
    "Single-edge closure equivalence: For a nonedge uv with deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n, G is Hamiltonian iff G+uv is Hamiltonian (crucial for iteration).",
    "Under \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2 every nonedge satisfies the deg-sum condition, so iterative closure adds all nonedges to reach K_n; since K_n is Hamiltonian (n \u2265 3) the original G is Hamiltonian (Dirac).",
    "\u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2 also implies G is connected and has no cut-vertex (2\u2011connected), with short degree-counting proofs.",
    "Sharpness: K_{k\u22121,k+1} (even n) and K_{k,k+1} (odd n) show the n/2 bound is tight; bipartiteness/parity blocks Hamiltonicity in these examples.",
    "Verifier: plan accepted (verifier verdict = success), but a curated outputs.md containing the finished proofs is still missing."

  "next_questions": [
    "Produce a curated outputs.md containing the full, self-contained proofs of Lemmas 1\u20135 and the Dirac theorem with explicit indexing/endpoint justifications (handle n \u2265 3 and note n = 2 separately).",
    "Optionally add a short appendix with the Ore-style statement/proof or a P\u00f3sa rotation-extension sketch, and include the 2-connectivity/diameter corollaries and the sharpness examples as formal propositions."
