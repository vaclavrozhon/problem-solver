Round summary: Prover-01 and Prover-02 supply a complete closure-based proof plan for Dirac's theorem (n = |V| ≥ 3). Key steps: prove the path-closing lemma for a Hamiltonian path P with endpoints u,v (if deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n then P closes to a Hamiltonian cycle); deduce the single-edge closure equivalence (adding a nonedge uv with deg-sum ≥ n preserves Hamiltonicity both ways); iterate this safe addition under δ(G) ≥ n/2 to obtain K_n and conclude G is Hamiltonian. Both provers also record supporting lemmas (δ ≥ n/2 implies connected and 2‑connected), small technical checks on indexing/endpoints, and sharpness examples (K_{k−1,k+1} and K_{k,k+1}). Optional alternative routes (Ore or Pósa) are noted. outputs.md was not produced in this round; the Verifier reports success on the submitted summaries.
