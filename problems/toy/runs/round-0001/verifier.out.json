  "feedback_md": "Both reports converge on the same correct and classical closure-based proof of Dirac\u2019s theorem, and the technical core (the path-closing lemma and the single-edge closure equivalence) is handled carefully. I audited each step for boundary/index issues and unchecked assumptions:\n\n- Connectivity and 2-connectivity lemmas: Both are correct. The key inequalities are sound: in a disconnected graph the smallest component has size s \u2264 floor((n\u22121)/2), so a vertex in it has degree \u2264 s\u22121 < n/2; in the cut-vertex case, a vertex in the smallest component of G\u2212w has degree \u2264 s (neighbors in its component plus possibly w) and s \u2264 floor((n\u22121)/2) < n/2. No gaps.\n\n- Path-closing lemma: Both versions are valid. Prover 01 uses the shifted set B\u2032 so that |A| + |B\u2032| = deg(u) + deg(v), and notes disjointness unless a Hamiltonian cycle already exists. Prover 02 uses A and B with indices offset by one and bounds |A|+|B| \u2264 n\u22121 unless some index triggers the cycle. The delicate points are (i) explicitly excluding uv \u2208 E at the outset (otherwise the path closes immediately), and (ii) justifying |A| = deg(u) and |B| = deg(v) by noting that, with uv \u2209 E and P Hamiltonian, all neighbors of u and v lie among the interior vertices x1,\u2026,x_{n\u22122}. Both reports state this; I retained the explicit indexing in the curated proof.\n\n- Single-edge closure equivalence: Correct and uses the path-closing lemma precisely in the needed direction (removing uv from a Hamiltonian cycle in G+uv yields a Hamiltonian path in G with endpoints u,v; the degree-sum condition is in G). This is the essential equivalence for iterative closure.\n\n- Iteration to K_n under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2: Sound. Degrees only increase, so the \u201cOre-eligible\u201d condition persists; adding all nonedges yields K_n, which is Hamiltonian for n \u2265 3.\n\n- Sharpness examples: Both even and odd n examples are correct and well-justified by bipartiteness (cycles are even). These are useful to include as a \u201csharpness\u201d proposition.\n\nMinor refinement: In the path-closing lemma, it is cleanest to state \u201cIf uv \u2208 E we are done; otherwise define A,B and note |A|+|B| = deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n, but |A|+|B| \u2264 n\u22121 unless the desired pair of edges occurs; hence a cycle exists.\u201d This avoids a slight logical hiccup of appealing to disjointness as if already known.\n\nI have curated: (i) connectivity and 2-connectivity consequences, (ii) the path-closing lemma, (iii) the single-edge closure equivalence, (iv) the closure-to-K_n step, and (v) Dirac\u2019s theorem with proofs, plus a sharpness proposition. All are self-contained under the stated setup n \u2265 3, finite simple graphs.\n\nPromising next steps:\n- Prove Ore\u2019s theorem as an immediate corollary of the single-edge equivalence (no need to iterate to K_n).\n- Prove the full Bondy\u2013Chv\u00e1tal closure theorem (Hamiltonicity is equivalent to Hamiltonicity of the closure cl(G)). This generalizes our single-edge step and subsumes both Dirac and Ore.\n- Record the common-neighbor corollary under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2: any two nonadjacent vertices have at least two common neighbors (useful for rotation-extension). I noted this in the notes.\n- Optional: Extend to pancyclicity (Bondy): if \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2, then G is either pancyclic or is K_{n/2,n/2}. Also consider a constructive algorithm for finding a Hamiltonian cycle via closures and the path-closing lemma.\n",

We index Hamiltonian paths as P = x_0,x_1,\u2026,x_{n\u22121} with u = x_0 and v = x_{n\u22121}.\n\nPath-closing lemma (indexing we will use): If P is Hamiltonian and deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n, then G has a Hamiltonian cycle. If uv \u2208 E, the path closes immediately. Otherwise define\n- A = { i \u2208 {1,\u2026,n\u22122} : u is adjacent to x_i },\n- B = { i \u2208 {2,\u2026,n\u22121} : v is adjacent to x_{i\u22121} }.\nBecause P spans all vertices and uv \u2209 E, |A| = deg(u) and |B| = deg(v). For i \u2208 {2,\u2026,n\u22122}, the simultaneous occurrence i \u2208 A \u2229 B yields the Hamiltonian cycle u\u2212x_i\u2212\u2026\u2212v\u2212x_{i\u22121}\u2212\u2026\u2212u.

Hence A \u2229 B \u2260 \u2205 and the cycle exists.\n\nSingle-edge closure equivalence: If uv \u2209 E(G) with deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n, then G is Hamiltonian iff G+uv is Hamiltonian. The backward direction uses the path-closing lemma after removing uv from a Hamiltonian cycle in G+uv.\n\nClosure under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2: If \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2, every nonedge uv satisfies deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n. Adding all such nonedges (degrees only increase) yields K_n. By the equivalence at each step, Hamiltonicity is preserved.\n\nImmediate consequences recorded\n- Connectivity: \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 \u21d2 G is connected.\n- 2-connectivity: \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 \u21d2 G has no cut-vertex.\n- Common neighbors under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2: For nonadjacent u,v, |N(u)\u222aN(v)| \u2264 n\u22122, so |N(u)\u2229N(v)| \u2265 deg(u)+deg(v) \u2212 (n\u22122) \u2265 2. Thus any nonadjacent pair has at least two common neighbors.

For odd n=2k+1, K_{k,k+1} has \u03b4 = k = \u230an/2\u230b and is non-Hamiltonian (all cycles even). Thus Dirac\u2019s bound can\u2019t be lowered.\n\nWhat\u2019s next\n- Add Ore\u2019s theorem as a corollary of the single-edge equivalence (no full closure needed).\n- Prove the full Bondy\u2013Chv\u00e1tal closure theorem cl(G) is Hamiltonian iff G is.\n- Optional: Pancyclicity strengthening (Bondy) under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2, and a constructive extraction of a Hamiltonian cycle via closure plus the path-closing lemma.\n",

  "new_outputs_md": "Definitions and standing assumptions\n- Graphs are finite, simple, undirected. Let n = |V(G)| \u2265 3. Write \u03b4(G) for the minimum degree. A Hamiltonian path/cycle is a path/cycle on all n vertices.\n\nProposition 1 (Connectivity). If \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2, then G is connected.\nProof. Suppose G is disconnected, and let C be a smallest component with |C| = s. Any v \u2208 C has deg(v) \u2264 s\u22121. If s \u2264 n/2 then deg(v) \u2264 n/2\u22121 < n/2, contradicting \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2. Hence s \u2265 n/2+1, but then the union of two components already has more than n vertices, a contradiction. \u220e\n\nProposition 2 (2-connectivity). If \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2, then G has no cut-vertex.\nProof. Suppose w is a cut-vertex. Let the components of G\u2212w be H_1,\u2026,H_t with t \u2265 2, and set s = min_i |V(H_i)|. For any x in a smallest component, x has neighbors only within that component and possibly w, so deg(x) \u2264 (s\u22121)+1 = s. Since s \u2264 (n\u22121)/2, we get deg(x) \u2264 (n\u22121)/2 < n/2, contradicting \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2. \u220e\n\nLemma 3 (Path-closing). Let P = x_0,x_1,\u2026,x_{n\u22121} be a Hamiltonian path in G with endpoints u = x_0 and v = x_{n\u22121}. If deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n, then G has a Hamiltonian cycle.\nProof. If uv \u2208 E(G), adding uv closes P into a Hamiltonian cycle. Assume uv \u2209 E(G). Define\nA = { i \u2208 {1,\u2026,n\u22122} : u is adjacent to x_i },\nB = { i \u2208 {2,\u2026,n\u22121} : v is adjacent to x_{i\u22121} }.\nBecause P spans all vertices and uv \u2209 E(G), every neighbor of u (resp. v) lies among x_1,\u2026,x_{n\u22122}, so |A| = deg(u) and |B| = deg(v). For i \u2208 {2,\u2026,n\u22122}, if both u\u223cx_i and v\u223cx_{i\u22121} hold (i.e., i \u2208 A \u2229 B), then the cycle\nu, x_i, x_{i+1}, \u2026, x_{n\u22121}(=v), x_{i\u22121}, x_{i\u22122}, \u2026, x_0(=u)\nuses edges of P plus the two chords and spans all vertices. If A \u2229 B = \u2205, then among the (n\u22123) indices i \u2208 {2,\u2026,n\u22122} at most one of i \u2208 A or i \u2208 B can occur each time, and additionally index 1 can contribute only to A and index n\u22121 only to B. Hence |A|+|B| \u2264 (n\u22123)+1+1 = n\u22121, contradicting deg(u)+deg(v) = |A|+|B| \u2265 n. Therefore A \u2229 B \u2260 \u2205 and the Hamiltonian cycle exists. \u220e\n\nLemma 4 (Single-edge closure equivalence). Let uv \u2209 E(G) with deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n, and let G\u2032 = G + uv. Then G is Hamiltonian if and only if G\u2032 is Hamiltonian.\nProof. If G is Hamiltonian then so is the supergraph G\u2032. Conversely, suppose G\u2032 has a Hamiltonian cycle. If the cycle avoids uv, it is a Hamiltonian cycle of G. If it uses uv, then deleting uv yields a Hamiltonian path in G with endpoints u and v; apply Lemma 3 to conclude that G is Hamiltonian. \u220e\n\nLemma 5 (Closure to K_n under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2). If \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2, then for every nonedge {u,v} we have deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n. Iteratively adding all such nonedges yields K_n.\nProof. Under \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2, any two vertices satisfy deg(u) \u2265 n/2 and deg(v) \u2265 n/2, so deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n. Adding a nonedge can only increase degrees, so the degree-sum condition persists for remaining nonedges. After finitely many additions, all nonedges are added and the resulting graph is K_n. \u220e\n\nTheorem 6 (Dirac\u2019s theorem). Let G be a graph on n \u2265 3 vertices. If \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2, then G is Hamiltonian.\nProof. By Lemma 5 we may add all nonedges with degree-sum at least n to obtain K_n. By Lemma 4, Hamiltonicity is preserved (equivalently) at each addition, so G is Hamiltonian if and only if K_n is. Since K_n has a Hamiltonian cycle for n \u2265 3, G is Hamiltonian. \u220e\n\nProposition 7 (Sharpness of the bound). The threshold n/2 cannot be lowered.\n(a) For even n = 2k, the graph K_{k\u22121, k+1} has \u03b4 = k\u22121 = n/2\u22121 and is not Hamiltonian (a Hamiltonian cycle in a bipartite graph must alternate evenly, impossible with parts of different sizes).\n(b) For odd n = 2k+1, the graph K_{k, k+1} has \u03b4 = k = \u230an/2\u230b and is not Hamiltonian (all cycles in bipartite graphs are even, but n is odd).\nThus the bound n/2 is best possible up to rounding. \u220e\n",
