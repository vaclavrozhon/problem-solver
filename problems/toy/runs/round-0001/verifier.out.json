  "feedback_md": "Overall assessment: Both provers present a standard, correct, and essentially complete proof of Dirac\u2019s theorem via the Bondy\u2013Chv\u00e1tal single-edge closure, with sensible preliminaries (connectivity/2-connectivity) and sharpness examples. The combinatorial heart (path-closing lemma from a Hamiltonian path under a degree-sum \u2265 n) is stated and proved carefully enough in both reports. I checked edge cases and indexing: with a minor tidy-up on the index ranges, both versions are rigorous.\n\nKey checks and minor nits:\n- 2-connectivity from \u03b4 \u2265 n/2: Your counting proof is standard and correct. It may help to state explicitly that every component of G \u2212 v must have size \u2265 n/2, forcing a+b \u2265 n against a+b = n\u22121.\n- Path-closing lemma: Both versions are correct. For absolute clarity, note explicitly that (with u = x0, v = x_{n\u22121}) A \u2286 {1,\u2026,n\u22122} and B \u2286 {2,\u2026,n\u22121}, so any i in A \u2229 B automatically lies in {2,\u2026,n\u22122}. Prover 02\u2019s S/T formulation is also fine; just make the neighbor\u2013index bijection explicit.\n- Closure step: Your equivalence (G Hamiltonian iff G+uv Hamiltonian) is correct and fully justified by the path-closing lemma. The iterative argument to K_n is solid since degrees only increase.\n- Sharpness: The K_{k\u22121,k+1} and K_{k,k+1} families are correct; also the remark that K_{m,m} is Hamiltonian for m \u2265 2 is important to avoid a common misconception.\n- Claim about two common neighbors from a large degree sum is correct but not used in the closure proof. Keep it if you also include a direct P\u00f3sa/Ore-style proof; otherwise it can be trimmed.\n- Small-n edge cases: Prover 02\u2019s Claim 0 is sensible; state n \u2265 3 up front.\n\n3-row table:\n| Claim (short) | Status [OK/Unclear/Broken] | Why |\n| \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 \u21d2 2-connected | OK | Standard component-size counting yields contradiction a+b = n\u22121 \u2265 n. |\n| Path-closing lemma (deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n) | OK | Pigeonhole on adjacency indices; constructed cycle uses only G-edges; indexing clean with explicit ranges. |\n| Closure \u21d2 Dirac | OK | Single-edge equivalence preserves Hamiltonicity; \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 lets us add all nonedges to reach K_n. |\n\nValue triage: High. The pipeline is clean, self-contained, and standard. The only polish needed is index normalization (x0..x_{n\u22121} vs x1..xn) and a compact, final LaTeX writeup.\n\nTargeted notes:\n- Prover 01: Very clear path-closing construction; keep the explicit listing of used edges. You can drop Claim 2 unless using it later.\n- Prover 02: Good normalization and small-n discussion. If you mention counterexamples at \u03b4 \u2265 floor(n/2) with cut-vertices, either give a concrete construction or omit the aside.",
  "summary_md": "- Both reports give a correct, complete proof of Dirac via the Bondy\u2013Chv\u00e1tal single-edge closure; core lemmas check out.\n- 2-connectivity from \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 is proved correctly via component-size counting; keep this as a short preliminary.\n- The path-closing lemma is sound; clarify the neighbor\u2013index bijection and index ranges to avoid off-by-one worries.\n- The closure equivalence (G Hamiltonian iff G+uv Hamiltonian for deg-sum \u2265 n) is correctly deduced; iteration to K_n is valid since degrees only increase.\n- Sharpness examples K_{k\u22121,k+1} (even n) and K_{k,k+1} (odd n) are correct; avoid citing K_{k,k} as a counterexample.\n- Minor polish: unify indexing (x0..x_{n\u22121} or x1..xn) across lemmas; state n \u2265 3 explicitly.\n- Optional: include the direct P\u00f3sa/Ore-style proof as a cross-check; then Claim on two common neighbors becomes relevant.\n- Next steps: produce the clean LaTeX writeup of Lemma (path-closing), single-edge closure, and Dirac via closure; add sharpness and small-n sanity checks.",
