--- SYSTEM ---
You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md and outputs.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers
- notes.md (summary so far)
- outputs.md (rigorously proven results so far)

Guidelines:
- notes.md: should be a readable running log of interesting work. Prefer appending. Replace only if old notes are clearly misleading.
- outputs.md: should be concise and rigorous. Keep only proven theorems with clear proofs. If a statement is flawed and you cannot fix it, remove it from outputs.md and instead add it to notes.md with explanation.
- Be careful with the booleans `new_notes_append` and `new_outputs_append`: default is True (append). Use False only when deliberately rewriting everything.

Tasks:
1) Audit rigor: identify unjustified steps, false statements, missing lemmas; produce minimal counterexamples.
2) Triage value: separate genuine progress from noise.
3) Guide next steps: propose what provers should try next.

I will propose a clean closure-based proof plan with self-contained lemmas and give complete proofs suitable for outputs.md. I also flag small technical points to watch (endpoints, index ranges, n \u2265 3).\n\nPlan (closure route to Dirac)\n- Prove the path-closing lemma: a Hamiltonian path with endpoints u,v and deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n closes to a Hamiltonian cycle. Why useful: it is the local engine for the Bondy\u2013Chv\u00e1tal single-edge step.\n- Deduce the single-edge closure equivalence: adding a nonedge uv with deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n preserves Hamiltonicity (iff). Why useful: allows iterative augmentation without changing Hamiltonicity.\n- Under \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2, every nonedge has deg-sum \u2265 n, so the iterative closure yields K_n; therefore G is Hamiltonian. Why useful: completes Dirac\u2019s theorem.\n- Record connectivity and 2-connectivity consequences of \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 and sharpness examples. Why useful: prevents false counterexamples and documents optimality of the bound.\n\nSetting\n- All graphs are finite, simple, undirected; n = |V(G)| \u2265 3. Write \u03b4(G) for the minimum degree.\n\nLemma 1 (Connectivity from \u03b4 \u2265 n/2)\n- Claim: If \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2, then G is connected.\n- Proof: If G were disconnected, let C be a smallest component, |C| = s. Each v \u2208 C has deg(v) \u2264 s \u2212 1. If s \u2264 n/2 then deg(v) \u2264 s \u2212 1 \u2264 n/2 \u2212 1 < n/2, contradicting \u03b4 \u2265 n/2. Hence s \u2265 n/2 + 1, but two disjoint components then have \u2265 (n/2 + 1) + (n/2 + 1) > n vertices, impossible. \u220e\n\nLemma 2 (2-connectivity from \u03b4 \u2265 n/2)\n- Claim: If \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2, then G has no cut-vertex.\n- Proof: Suppose w is a cut-vertex. Let the components of G \u2212 w be H_1,\u2026,H_t with t \u2265 2, and let s = min_i |V(H_i)|. For any x \u2208 V(H_i) (the smallest one), x has neighbors only in H_i and possibly w, hence deg(x) \u2264 (s \u2212 1) + 1 = s. Also s \u2264 (n \u2212 1)/2, so deg(x) \u2264 (n \u2212 1)/2 < n/2, contradicting \u03b4 \u2265 n/2. \u220e\n\nLemma 3 (Path-closing lemma)\n- Statement: Let G have a Hamiltonian path P = x_0 x_1 \u2026 x_{n\u22121} with endpoints u = x_0 and v = x_{n\u22121}. If uv \u2209 E(G) and deg(u) + deg(v) \u2265 n, then G has a Hamiltonian cycle.\n- Proof (indexing per notes): Define\n  A = { i \u2208 {1,\u2026,n\u22122} : u is adjacent to x_i },\n  B = { i \u2208 {2,\u2026,n\u22121} : v is adjacent to x_{i\u22121} }.\n  Because uv \u2209 E(G), every neighbor of u lies among {x_1,\u2026,x_{n\u22122}}, so |A| = deg(u). Likewise, every neighbor of v lies among {x_1,\u2026,x_{n\u22122}}, so |B| = deg(v) (via the shift i \u21a6 i \u2212 1).\n  For each i \u2208 {1,\u2026,n\u22122}, we cannot have both edges u x_i and v x_{i\u22121}, because then the cycle\n  x_0(=u) \u2014 x_i \u2014 x_{i+1} \u2014 \u2026 \u2014 x_{n\u22121}(=v) \u2014 x_{i\u22121} \u2014 x_{i\u22122} \u2014 \u2026 \u2014 x_1 \u2014 x_0\n  would be a Hamiltonian cycle in G already. Equivalently, A and B\u2032 := {i \u2212 1 : i \u2208 B} are disjoint subsets of {1,\u2026,n\u22122}. Hence |A| + |B\u2032| \u2264 n \u2212 2. But |B\u2032| = |B|, so deg(u) + deg(v) = |A| + |B| = |A| + |B\u2032| \u2264 n \u2212 2, contradicting deg(u) + deg(v) \u2265 n. Therefore some i has both edges present, giving the Hamiltonian cycle as displayed. \u220e\n- Why useful: This is the core combinatorial step ensuring we can remove a \u201cclosure edge\u201d from a Hamiltonian cycle and still recover Hamiltonicity in the original graph.\n\nLemma 4 (Single-edge closure equivalence)\n- Statement: Let uv \u2209 E(G) with deg(u) + deg(v) \u2265 n, and let G\u2032 = G + uv. Then G is Hamiltonian iff G\u2032 is Hamiltonian.\n- Proof: If G is Hamiltonian then so is its supergraph G\u2032. Conversely, suppose G\u2032 has a Hamiltonian cycle C. If C does not use uv, then C \u2286 G and we are done. If C uses uv, delete uv from C to obtain a Hamiltonian path P of G with endpoints u and v. Apply Lemma 3 to P and deg(u) + deg(v) \u2265 n to conclude that G has a Hamiltonian cycle. \u220e\n- Why useful: Allows iterative addition of edges with deg-sum \u2265 n without changing Hamiltonicity.\n\nLemma 5 (Closure to K_n under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2)\n- Claim: If \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2, then for every nonadjacent pair {u,v}, deg(u) + deg(v) \u2265 n. Consequently, adding all such nonedges yields K_n.\n- Proof: \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2 implies deg(u) \u2265 n/2 and deg(v) \u2265 n/2 for all u,v, so the sum is \u2265 n. Add any nonedge uv; degrees only increase, so at any stage every remaining nonedge still has deg-sum \u2265 n. Adding all of them produces a complete graph. \u220e\n- Why useful: Reduces Dirac to the trivial Hamiltonicity of K_n.\n\nTheorem (Dirac)\n- Statement: For n \u2265 3, every graph G with \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2 is Hamiltonian.\n- Proof: Iteratively add nonedges with deg-sum \u2265 n to obtain K_n (Lemma 5). By Lemma 4, Hamiltonicity is preserved at each addition, so G is Hamiltonian iff K_n is, and K_n is Hamiltonian for n \u2265 3. \u220e\n\nSharpness and examples\n- Even n = 2k: The complete bipartite graph K_{k\u22121, k+1} has \u03b4 = k \u2212 1 = n/2 \u2212 1 and is not Hamiltonian (unbalanced bipartite graphs have no spanning cycle). Shows the bound cannot be lowered below n/2.\n- Odd n = 2k + 1: K_{k, k+1} has \u03b4 = k = \u230an/2\u230b and is not Hamiltonian (all cycles are even in bipartite graphs). Shows replacing n/2 by \u230an/2\u230b would be false.\n\nChecks and potential pitfalls\n- n \u2265 3 is essential: for n = 2, \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 = 1 gives K_2, which has no Hamiltonian cycle in simple graphs (no 2-cycles). Our theorem correctly excludes n = 2.\n- Indexing in Lemma 3 carefully avoids referring to uv by restricting A to 1,\u2026,n\u22122 and using the shifted B. The disjointness is proved on A and B\u2032.\n- Closure of K_{n/2, n/2} is indeed K_n: nonedges lie within parts, and each such pair has deg-sum = n, so all are added. No contradiction with Dirac (K_{n/2,n/2} itself is Hamiltonian for n \u2265 4).\n\nAlternative route (for appendix)\n- One can also derive Dirac via Ore\u2019s theorem (if deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n for all nonadjacent u,v, then G is Hamiltonian), which in turn follows by the same single-edge closure lemma without fully iterating to K_n. Or via P\u00f3sa\u2019s rotation-extension method plus a longest-path argument. These are optional and not needed for the main proof.\n\nNext steps\n- Curate Lemmas 1\u20135 and the Dirac theorem proof into outputs.md with explicit statements and proofs as above.\n- Optionally add a brief note on 2-connectivity corollary and the sharpness examples.\n- If desired, include a short Ore-style proof as an appendix for completeness."}, {"prover_id": "02", "progress_md": "Status and gaps\n- outputs.md was not provided in this round, so I cannot audit what has been formally curated. From the summaries/notes, the planned closure-based proof is the right route, but key steps still need fully written, checkable proofs: (i) the path-closing lemma on a Hamiltonian path under a degree-sum condition; (ii) the single-edge closure equivalence; (iii) the iteration to K_n under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2; and (iv) brief proofs of connectivity and 2-connectivity under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2. I supply clean statements and proofs below, aligned with the indexing convention in notes.md, and note any delicate points.\n\nSetup\n- Graphs are finite, simple, undirected; n = |V(G)| \u2265 3. A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle through all n vertices.\n- Dirac\u2019s theorem target: If \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2, then G is Hamiltonian. This resolves the task in the affirmative.\n\nIdeas (plan of attack)\n- Use Bondy\u2013Chv\u00e1tal-style single-edge closure: nonedge uv with deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n is \u201csafe\u201d to add w.r.t. Hamiltonicity (equivalence). Prove via the path-closing lemma along a Hamiltonian path obtained by removing uv from a Hamiltonian cycle in G+uv.\n- Under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2, every nonedge satisfies the degree-sum condition, so iterating the closure adds all missing edges and yields K_n. Since equivalence holds at each step and K_n is Hamiltonian, G is Hamiltonian.\n- Add short lemmas: \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 implies connected and indeed 2-connected; sharpness examples at \u03b4 = \u2308n/2\u2309\u22121.\n\nKey lemmas with proofs (auditable)\n1) Connectivity and 2\u2011connectivity from \u03b4 \u2265 n/2\n- Claim (connectivity): If \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2, G is connected.\n  Proof sketch: If disconnected with components of sizes a \u2264 b, then any vertex in the smaller component has degree \u2264 a\u22121 \u2264 \u230a(n\u22121)/2\u230b < n/2, contradiction.\n- Claim (2\u2011connectivity): If \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2, G has no cut-vertex.\n  Proof sketch: Suppose x is a cut-vertex, and G\u2212x has components of sizes p \u2264 q with p+q = n\u22121. Any vertex u in the smaller component has deg(u) \u2264 (p\u22121)+1 = p \u2264 \u230a(n\u22121)/2\u230b < n/2, contradiction.\n  Why useful: Removes earlier misconception about disconnected counterexamples; ensures robust structure for Hamiltonicity arguments.\n\n2) Path\u2011closing lemma (notes.md indexing)\n- Statement: Let G be on n vertices and let P = x_0, x_1, \u2026, x_{n\u22121} be a Hamiltonian path with endpoints u = x_0 and v = x_{n\u22121}. If deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n, then G has a Hamiltonian cycle.\n- Proof: If uv \u2208 E(G), we are done. Assume uv \u2209 E(G). Define\n  A = { i \u2208 {1,\u2026,n\u22122} : u is adjacent to x_i },\n  B = { i \u2208 {2,\u2026,n\u22121} : v is adjacent to x_{i\u22121} }.\n  Because P spans all vertices and uv \u2209 E, we have |A| = deg(u) and |B| = deg(v) (the indexing omits the impossible end-neighbor). Suppose, for contradiction, that A \u2229 B = \u2205. Then, for each i \u2208 {2,\u2026,n\u22122}, at most one of the adjacencies u\u223cx_i or v\u223cx_{i\u22121} holds; also, i=1 can contribute to A only and i=n\u22121 can contribute to B only. Hence |A|+|B| \u2264 (n\u22123)+1+1 = n\u22121. Therefore deg(u)+deg(v) \u2264 n\u22121, contradicting the hypothesis deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n. Thus A \u2229 B \u2260 \u2205; choose i \u2208 A \u2229 B. Then u\u223cx_i and v\u223cx_{i\u22121}, and the cycle u, x_i, x_{i+1}, \u2026, x_{n\u22121}(=v), x_{i\u22121}, x_{i\u22122}, \u2026, x_0(=u) uses edges of P plus the two chords and spans all vertices. So G is Hamiltonian. QED.\n  Why useful: This is the central combinatorial step used in closure proofs.\n\n3) Single\u2011edge closure equivalence\n- Statement: Let G be on n vertices and uv \u2209 E(G) with deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n. Then G is Hamiltonian iff G+uv is Hamiltonian.\n- Proof: \u201c\u21d2\u201d is trivial since adding edges preserves Hamiltonicity. For \u201c\u21d0\u201d, suppose G+uv has a Hamiltonian cycle. If the cycle avoids uv, it is a Hamiltonian cycle in G. If it uses uv, then removing uv yields a Hamiltonian path in G with endpoints u and v; apply the path\u2011closing lemma to conclude G is Hamiltonian. QED.\n  Why useful: Allows iterative addition of all \u201cOre-eligible\u201d nonedges while preserving Hamiltonicity equivalence.\n\n4) Iteration to K_n under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2\n- Observation: If \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2, then for any distinct u,v we have deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n. In particular, every nonedge uv meets the hypothesis of the single\u2011edge closure equivalence.\n- Iteration: Enumerate the nonedges uv_1, uv_2, \u2026 arbitrarily and add them one-by-one. At each addition, degrees do not decrease, so the degree\u2011sum condition remains valid for all remaining nonedges. By the equivalence lemma, Hamiltonicity is preserved both ways at each step. When all nonedges are added, the resulting graph is K_n, which is Hamiltonian for n \u2265 3. Hence the original G is Hamiltonian. QED (Dirac).\n  Why useful: Completes the closure route from \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 to Hamiltonicity.\n\n5) Sharpness examples (cannot lower the bound)\n- Even n = 2k: Let G = K_{k\u22121, k+1}. Then \u03b4(G) = k\u22121 = n/2 \u2212 1. Any Hamiltonian cycle in a bipartite graph must alternate parts, so it uses equal numbers from each part; since the parts have sizes k\u22121 and k+1, no Hamiltonian cycle exists. Shows the n/2 bound cannot be decreased.\n- Odd n = 2k+1: Let G = K_{k, k+1}. Then \u03b4(G) = k = \u230an/2\u230b < \u2308n/2\u2309. By parity/alternation, no Hamiltonian cycle exists (a Hamiltonian cycle would have even length n). Shows that replacing n/2 by \u230an/2\u230b fails.\n\nSmall auxiliary facts (optional but clean)\n- Diameter \u2264 2 under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2: For nonadjacent u,v, |N(u)|+|N(v)| \u2265 n, so they share a neighbor; hence dist(u,v) = 2. Not essential, but often used heuristically.\n- Longest path bound: Every graph has a path with at least \u03b4(G)+1 vertices. Proof: Let P be a longest path of length \u2113 (\u2113+1 vertices). An endpoint x has all neighbors on P, so deg(x) \u2264 \u2113. Hence \u2113 \u2265 \u03b4(G), giving \u2113+1 \u2265 \u03b4(G)+1. Not used in the closure route, but consistent with the summaries.\n\nExamples / sanity checks\n- n=3: \u03b4 \u2265 3/2 \u21d2 \u03b4 \u2265 2, so G = K_3, which is Hamiltonian. Base case aligns with Dirac.\n- Complete bipartite K_{n/2, n/2} (n even): \u03b4 = n/2; it is Hamiltonian (indeed has many Hamiltonian cycles). Under closure, every nonedge is within a part and gets added (degree-sum = n), ultimately giving K_n, consistent with the equivalence lemma.\n\nObstacles / delicate points to watch\n- Indexing in the path\u2011closing lemma: adhering to A = {1,\u2026,n\u22122} and B = {2,\u2026,n\u22121} avoids the trivial non-neighbor positions and makes |A|=deg(u), |B|=deg(v) precise. Any writeup should explicitly justify those equalities because they rely on P being Hamiltonian and uv \u2209 E.\n- Ensure the \u201cequivalence\u201d direction in the closure step is stated and proved; some expositions only show the forward implication, which is not enough for iteration by equivalence.\n\nNext steps (for outputs.md)\n- Add the fully written proofs of Lemmas 1\u20134 above, with the exact indexing as recorded here; this is a complete, rigorous closure-based proof of Dirac\u2019s theorem for n \u2265 3.\n- Include the 2-connectivity lemma and both sharpness examples, as brief propositions with proofs.\n- Optionally append an Ore/P\u00f3sa alternative proof for completeness (not needed for the main result).\n- Verify definitions section explicitly states the class of graphs and n \u2265 3 to avoid n=2 edge-case confusion.\n"}]
