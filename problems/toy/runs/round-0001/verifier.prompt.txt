Note and use the immediate consequence \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 \u21d2 every nonedge uv satisfies deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n.\n- Prove two basic structural lemmas under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2: (i) connectivity and (ii) 2-connectivity. Why useful: rules out trivial counterexamples and enables path/cycle splicing arguments.\n- Prove a path-closing lemma (pigeonhole on a Hamiltonian path between u and v with deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n). Why useful: this is the key single-step Bondy\u2013Chv\u00e1tal closure move.\n- Derive the single-edge closure equivalence (G is Hamiltonian iff G+uv is Hamiltonian when deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n).\n- Conclude Dirac via iterating closure to K_n; record sharpness examples and sanity checks; flag pitfalls.\n\nSetup and standing assumptions\n- All graphs are finite, simple, undirected; |V(G)| = n \u2265 3. \u03b4(G) denotes minimum degree. \u201cHamiltonian\u201d = containing a cycle through all n vertices.\n- Target statement (Dirac): If \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2, then G is Hamiltonian.\n- Immediate observation: If \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2 and uv is a nonedge, then deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n.\n\nClaim 1 (Connectivity and 2-connectivity from \u03b4 \u2265 n/2)\n- Statement: If \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2, then G is connected and has no cut-vertex (i.e., G is 2-connected).\n- Sketch proof:\n  - Connectivity: Suppose G has \u2265 2 components, with sizes a and b \u2265 1 and a+b \u2264 n. Any vertex in the component of size a has degree \u2264 a\u22121, contradicting \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 unless a\u22121 \u2265 n/2. But then a \u2265 n/2+1 and similarly b \u2265 n/2+1, so a+b \u2265 n+2, impossible. Thus G is connected.\n  - No cut-vertex: Suppose v is a cut-vertex, so G\u2212v has \u2265 2 components A, B with sizes a = |A|, b = |B| and a+b = n\u22121. Pick u \u2208 A. Then N(u) \u2286 (A\u2212{u}) \u222a {v}, so deg(u) \u2264 (a\u22121)+1 = a. By \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 we get a \u2265 n/2. Similarly b \u2265 n/2. Then a+b \u2265 n, contradicting a+b = n\u22121. Hence no cut-vertex.\n- Why useful here: longest-path/closure arguments typically need at least connectivity; 2-connectivity prevents trivial obstructions and aligns with Hamiltonicity.\n- How it can fail: For n small (e.g., n=2) statements are false/trivial; we assumed n \u2265 3. For the cut-vertex part, we used the easy bound deg(u) \u2264 a; the only way around is if some u had neighbors outside A\u222a{v}, but that\u2019s impossible by definition of components of G\u2212v.\n- Quick test: n=6, \u03b4 \u2265 3. Try to engineer a cut vertex. If G\u2212v had components of sizes 3 and 2, then a=3, b=2 fail b \u2265 n/2=3. Contradiction as expected.\n\nClaim 2 (Two common neighbors from a large degree sum)\n- Statement: If u,v are nonadjacent and deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n, then |N(u) \u2229 N(v)| \u2265 2.\n- Proof: N(u), N(v) \u2286 V \\ {u,v}, so |N(u) \u222a N(v)| \u2264 n\u22122. Inclusion\u2013exclusion gives |N(u) \u2229 N(v)| = deg(u)+deg(v) \u2212 |N(u) \u222a N(v)| \u2265 deg(u)+deg(v) \u2212 (n\u22122) \u2265 2.\n- Why useful here: shows abundance of overlaps; often used to pivot/rotate paths and to rule out local obstructions.\n- How it can fail: If we mistakenly allowed loops or multiple edges or counted u \u2208 N(u), v \u2208 N(v), the bound breaks; but in simple graphs, neighborhoods exclude the vertex itself.\n- Quick test: In K_{m,m} with n=2m, any two nonadjacent vertices lie in the same part and have exactly m common neighbors; lower bound 2 is satisfied for m \u2265 2.\n\nClaim 3 (Longest path lower bound)\n- Statement: Every graph has a path on at least \u03b4(G)+1 vertices.\n- Proof: Let P be a longest path with endpoints x,y. Then all neighbors of x lie on P, so deg(x) \u2264 |P|\u22121. Hence |P| \u2265 deg(x)+1 \u2265 \u03b4+1.\n- Why useful here: sanity check on reachability; under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 this already yields a path of length \u2265 n/2+1, a mild step toward Hamiltonicity.\n- How it can fail: If we allowed infinite graphs or directed edges, the statement needs modification; here finite and undirected suffices.\n- Quick test: For C_5 (\u03b4=2) the longest path has length 3 (i.e., 3 vertices), consistent with \u03b4+1=3.\n\nLemma 4 (Path-closing lemma; pigeonhole on a Hamiltonian path)\n- Statement: Let G be a graph on n vertices. Let P = x_0, x_1, ..., x_{n-1} be a Hamiltonian path in G with endpoints x_0 = u and x_{n-1} = v, and suppose uv is not an edge. If deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n, then G has a Hamiltonian cycle.\n- Proof: Consider index set I = {1,2,...,n\u22121}. Define\n  - A = { i \u2208 I : u is adjacent to x_i } so |A| = deg(u) (all neighbors of u lie among x_1,...,x_{n\u22121}).\n  - B = { i \u2208 I : v is adjacent to x_{i\u22121} } so |B| = deg(v) (neighbors of v lie among x_0,...,x_{n\u22122}).\n  Then A,B \u2286 I and |A|+|B| \u2265 n = |I|+1, hence A \u2229 B \u2260 \u2205. Take i \u2208 A \u2229 B. Edges ux_i and v x_{i\u22121} are present. The following closed walk is a Hamiltonian cycle:\n  u = x_0, x_1, ..., x_i, then jump via ux_i back to u? No\u2014use the chords in the order that preserves simplicity:\n  Construct the cycle\n  u \u2014 x_i \u2014 x_{i+1} \u2014 ... \u2014 x_{n\u22121}(=v) \u2014 x_{i\u22121} \u2014 x_{i\u22122} \u2014 ... \u2014 x_1 \u2014 u,\n  where the edges used are: ux_i (by choice i \u2208 A), the path edges x_j x_{j+1} for j = i,...,n\u22122, the chord v x_{i\u22121} (by choice i \u2208 B), and the path edges x_{j} x_{j\u22121} for j = i\u22121,...,1. This visits every x_j exactly once and returns to u, hence is a Hamiltonian cycle.\n- Why useful here: This is the combinatorial heart of the Bondy\u2013Chv\u00e1tal single-edge closure step.\n- How it can fail: The indexing must avoid using uv; that\u2019s why B is defined with predecessors x_{i\u22121}. A common pitfall is to pair u with x_i and v with x_{i+1}; that pairing does not directly yield a simple cycle without repetition.\n- Quick test: Take n=6, a Hamiltonian path P = (u,a,b,c,d,v) with deg(u)=deg(v)=3. If uv \u2209 E, then A = {indices of neighbors of u} and B = {indices whose predecessors neighbor v} both have size 3 in I={1,...,5}; intersection exists, e.g., i=3 could work (u\u2014c and v\u2014b), and the cycle is u\u2014c\u2014d\u2014v\u2014b\u2014a\u2014u.\n\nLemma 5 (Single-edge closure equivalence; Bondy\u2013Chv\u00e1tal step)\n- Statement: Let G be a graph on n vertices and u,v nonadjacent with deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n. Then G is Hamiltonian iff G' = G + uv is Hamiltonian.\n- Proof: \u201cOnly if\u201d is trivial. For \u201cif\u201d, assume G' has a Hamiltonian cycle. If that cycle does not use uv, it lies in G and we are done. Otherwise, delete edge uv from the cycle; what remains is a Hamiltonian path in G from u to v. By Lemma 4, G then has a Hamiltonian cycle.\n- Why useful here: This makes adding edges with large degree sum a Hamiltonicity-preserving operation.\n- How it can fail: If the path-closing lemma were false or incorrectly applied (e.g., wrong pairing indices), or if G' were assumed Hamiltonian only via a cycle that cannot be converted, the equivalence would fail. Lemma 4 prevents this.\n- Quick test: In K_{3,3}, pick two same-side vertices u,v; deg(u)+deg(v)=6=n. K_{3,3} is Hamiltonian, and so are all supergraphs including the extra edge uv; closure preserves Hamiltonicity both ways.\n\nCorollary 6 (Dirac via closure)\n- Statement: If \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2, then G is Hamiltonian.\n- Proof idea: For any nonedge uv of G, deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n. By Lemma 5, adding any such nonedge preserves Hamiltonicity equivalence. Iteratively add all nonedges; degrees only increase, so the precondition remains true throughout. The process ends at K_n, which is Hamiltonian for n \u2265 3. Therefore, the original G is Hamiltonian.\n- Why useful here: This is a compact, auditable route to Dirac\u2019s theorem using only Lemma 4.\n- How it can fail: Must ensure we can indeed add all nonedges; but the premise deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n holds for every nonedge at the start (since \u03b4 \u2265 n/2), and only improves as we add edges. Another pitfall is n=2; our standing assumption n \u2265 3 avoids it. Finally, we used that K_n is Hamiltonian (trivial for n \u2265 3).\n- Quick tests:\n  - n=4: \u03b4 \u2265 2. All such graphs are Hamiltonian; e.g., C_4, K_4 minus any matching, etc.\n  - n=6: \u03b4 \u2265 3. Examples like K_{3,3} (bipartite) and the cocktail-party graph CP_3 (K_6 minus a perfect matching; \u03b4=4) are Hamiltonian.\n\nSharpness of the bound\n- Even n: K_{n/2\u22121, n/2+1} is connected, non-Hamiltonian (bipartite parts unequal), and has \u03b4 = n/2\u22121. Shows \u03b4 \u2265 n/2\u22121 does not suffice.\n- Odd n: K_{(n\u22121)/2, (n+1)/2} is connected, non-Hamiltonian, with \u03b4 = (n\u22121)/2 = \u230an/2\u230b < n/2. Again, threshold n/2 is tight.\n- How it can fail: One might mistakenly cite K_{n/2,n/2} as a counterexample at the boundary; but balanced complete bipartite graphs K_{m,m} are Hamiltonian for m \u2265 2 (they have many 2-factors that are cycles of length 2m).\n- Quick test: K_{2,4} (n=6) has \u03b4=2 = n/2\u22121 and is not Hamiltonian (unequal bipartition), as expected.\n\nNotes on earlier misconceptions and corrections\n- Disconnected counterexamples under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 do not exist: Claim 1 already forbids disconnectedness and cut-vertices. Any attempt to refute Dirac by a disconnected graph violates \u03b4 \u2265 n/2.\n\nSummary of where we are\n- We have given a clean, self-contained path-closing lemma (Lemma 4), the single-edge closure equivalence (Lemma 5), and the short derivation of Dirac via iterative closure (Corollary 6). We also established basic structure (2-connectivity) and recorded sharpness examples. The remaining work is presentation polish (LaTeX writeup), and optionally an alternative direct proof via longest-path rotations (P\u00f3sa/Ore-style) for redundancy.\n", "new_files": [], "requests_for_more_materials": [], "next_actions_for_prover": ["Write a clean LaTeX proof of Lemma 4 (path-closing) and Lemma 5 (closure step), then the one-paragraph derivation of Dirac via iterative closure, and integrate into task.tex.", "Optionally, prepare an alternative direct proof (without closure) via longest-path/rotation (P\u00f3sa) to cross-validate the argument.", "Add a short section documenting sharpness examples (K_{n/2\u22121,n/2+1} and K_{(n\u22121)/2,(n+1)/2}) and small-n sanity checks (n=3,4,5,6).", "Provide a brief note proving 2-connectivity under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 in task.tex, since it is a useful structural lemma and dispels earlier confusion.", "If desired, outline a constructive algorithm that, given a Hamiltonian path between u and v with deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n, produces a Hamiltonian cycle (implementing the Lemma 4 construction)."]}, {"prover_id": "02", "progress_md": "## Round 0001 \u2014 2025-08-27T09:50:46.706981Z\n\nMini-plan:\n- Normalize assumptions (finite, simple, undirected graphs; n \u2265 3) and note edge cases; clarify rounding of n/2.\n- Prove structural lemmas: \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 implies connectivity and in fact 2-connectivity.\n- Prove the Bondy\u2013Chv\u00e1tal single-edge closure step carefully (full self-contained argument).\n- Deduce Dirac from closure: under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2, the closure is K_n; conclude Hamiltonicity.\n- Record sharpness examples showing the bound cannot be reduced.\n- Sanity-check on small n and outline an alternative direct Dirac-style longest-cycle proof skeleton for later.\n\nSetup and normalization\n- We work with finite, simple, undirected graphs on n vertices, and will assume n \u2265 3. Interpret \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2 as \u03b4(G) \u2265 ceil(n/2) since degrees are integers.\n\nClaim 0. If n \u2264 2, the statement every graph with minimum degree \u2265 n/2 is Hamiltonian is false. Why useful here: Ensures we restrict to the standard n \u2265 3 regime of Dirac's theorem.\n- Proof sketch: For n = 1, \u03b4 = 0 \u2265 1/2, but there is no cycle of length 1 in standard conventions. For n = 2, K2 has \u03b4 = 1 = n/2 but has no cycle of length 2 in simple graphs.\n- How it can fail: If one adopts a nonstandard convention allowing a 2-cycle or loop, the statement might change; we exclude such conventions.\n- Quick test: K2 has \u03b4 = 1 \u2265 1 = n/2 but is not Hamiltonian. So we impose n \u2265 3 in the task.\n\nClaim 1. \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2 implies G is connected. Why useful here: Rules out disconnected counterexamples and supports later longest-path arguments.\n- Proof sketch: If G were disconnected with components of sizes a and n \u2212 a, then every vertex in the smaller component has degree at most a \u2212 1 \u2264 n/2 \u2212 1, contradicting \u03b4 \u2265 n/2.\n- How it can fail: If one weakens \u03b4 to \u2265 (n \u2212 1)/2, disconnected graphs can exist.\n- Quick test: Take n = 2k + 1 and G = K_k \u222a K_{k+1}. Then \u03b4 = k \u2212 1 = (n \u2212 3)/2 and G is disconnected; indeed \u03b4 < n/2.\n\nClaim 2. \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2 implies G is 2-connected (no cut-vertex). Why useful here: Prevents cut-vertex obstructions to extending cycles/paths and is a standard strengthening in the Dirac range.\n- Proof sketch: Suppose v is a cut-vertex. Then G \u2212 v has components A, B with |A| = a, |B| = b and a + b = n \u2212 1. For any u \u2208 A, all neighbors of u lie in A \u222a {v}, so deg(u) \u2264 (a \u2212 1) + 1 = a. Hence \u03b4 \u2264 min(a, b) \u2264 floor((n \u2212 1)/2) < n/2, contradiction.\n- How it can fail: If \u03b4 is only \u2265 floor(n/2), there are graphs with cut-vertices; for example, join a high-degree vertex to two dense blocks whose sizes are imbalanced.\n- Quick test: n = 6, suppose a cut splits into a = 2, b = 3. Then any u in the a-side has degree \u2264 2 < n/2 = 3; so \u03b4 \u2265 3 forbids a cut-vertex, consistent with the claim.\n\nClaim 3. Longest-path lower bound: every graph has a path with at least \u03b4(G) + 1 vertices. Why useful here: A standard baseline for rotation\u2013extension and path-to-cycle arguments; also a sanity check that \u03b4-scale phenomena reach linear size.\n- Proof sketch: Let P be a longest path with endpoint x. If a neighbor of x were outside P, we could extend P, contradiction. Thus all neighbors of x lie on P, so P contains x together with all deg(x) neighbors, giving |P| \u2265 deg(x) + 1 \u2265 \u03b4 + 1.\n- How it can fail: The analogous claim for cycles, length \u2265 \u03b4 + 1, is false in general; we only assert it for paths.\n- Quick test: In a star K_{1,m}, \u03b4 = 1 and indeed there is a path with 2 vertices; equality holds.\n\nClaim 4. Bondy\u2013Chv\u00e1tal single-edge closure step. Let u, v be nonadjacent vertices with deg(u) + deg(v) \u2265 n. Then G is Hamiltonian if and only if G + uv is Hamiltonian. Why useful here: It is the engine for the closure method; iterating it under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 will complete G to K_n without changing Hamiltonicity.\n- Proof sketch: The forward direction is trivial. For the backward direction, assume G + uv has a Hamiltonian cycle C. If C avoids edge uv, then C \u2286 G and we are done. Otherwise, delete edge uv from C to obtain a Hamiltonian path P in G from u to v, say P: x_1 = u, x_2, ..., x_n = v.\n  For i = 1, ..., n \u2212 1, consider the consecutive pair (x_i, x_{i+1}). Define S = {i \u2208 {1, ..., n \u2212 1} : u is adjacent to x_{i+1} in G} and T = {i \u2208 {1, ..., n \u2212 1} : v is adjacent to x_i in G}. Because P contains all vertices, the neighbors of u (resp. v) correspond bijectively to indices in S (resp. T), so |S| = deg(u), |T| = deg(v). If S and T were disjoint, then |S| + |T| \u2264 n \u2212 1, contradicting deg(u) + deg(v) \u2265 n. Hence there exists i with i \u2208 S \u2229 T, meaning u is adjacent to x_{i+1} and v is adjacent to x_i. Then the cycle u, x_{i+1}, x_{i+2}, ..., v, x_i, x_{i\u22121}, ..., x_1 = u is a Hamiltonian cycle in G avoiding uv. Thus G is Hamiltonian.\n- How it can fail: The degree-sum threshold is tight for this argument; if deg(u) + deg(v) \u2264 n \u2212 1, the sets S and T can be disjoint and the splice may be impossible.\n- Quick test: Let G be the path P4 on vertices 1\u22122\u22123\u22124. Then deg(1) + deg(4) = 2 < n = 4. G is not Hamiltonian, but G + 14 is Hamiltonian (C4). This does not contradict the lemma because the degree-sum condition fails.\n\nClaim 5. Under \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2, the closure cl(G) obtained by repeatedly adding nonedges uv with deg(u) + deg(v) \u2265 n is the complete graph K_n. Why useful here: Reduces Dirac to the trivial fact that K_n is Hamiltonian.\n- Proof sketch: Since deg(u) \u2265 n/2 and deg(v) \u2265 n/2 for all vertices, every nonedge uv already satisfies deg(u) + deg(v) \u2265 n in the original graph. Thus we may add every missing edge; degrees only increase, so the condition remains satisfied throughout. Eventually all missing edges are added and cl(G) = K_n.\n- How it can fail: If we only had \u03b4 \u2265 floor(n/2), then for some nonedges uv, the sum deg(u) + deg(v) could be n \u2212 1, and the closure may stop before reaching K_n.\n- Quick test: n = 6, \u03b4 \u2265 3. Any nonedge uv has deg(u) + deg(v) \u2265 6, so it is added. After processing all, we indeed get K6.\n\nClaim 6. Dirac via closure. If n \u2265 3 and \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2, then G is Hamiltonian. Why useful here: This directly addresses the task.\n- Proof sketch: By Claim 5, cl(G) = K_n. By Claim 4 applied at each added edge, Hamiltonicity is preserved during closure. K_n is Hamiltonian for n \u2265 3 (cycle through the vertices), hence so is G.\n- How it can fail: Only if an intermediate application of Claim 4 were invalid; but the degree-sum hypothesis holds for every added edge throughout, so the chain is valid.\n- Quick test: n = 5, \u03b4 \u2265 3. For instance, take K5 minus two disjoint edges; \u03b4 = 3. Closure adds back both missing edges, reaching K5, hence G is Hamiltonian; indeed one sees a 5-cycle directly.\n\nClaim 7. Sharpness of the bound. The threshold \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 cannot be lowered in general.\n- Proof sketch: Even n = 2k: G = K_{k\u22121, k+1} has \u03b4 = k \u2212 1 = n/2 \u2212 1 and is not Hamiltonian because a bipartite Hamiltonian cycle would have to alternate perfectly between the two parts, which is impossible when part sizes are unequal. Odd n = 2k + 1: G = K_{k, k+1} has \u03b4 = k = floor(n/2) = ceil(n/2) \u2212 1 and is not Hamiltonian because any cycle in a bipartite graph has even length, but n is odd.\n- How it can fail: One might mistakenly cite K_{k,k} at n = 2k as a counterexample; but K_{k,k} is Hamiltonian (indeed 2-factorable), and in fact meets the Dirac bound with equality.\n- Quick test: n = 6, K_{2,4} has \u03b4 = 2 = n/2 \u2212 1 and is not Hamiltonian; n = 7, K_{3,4} has \u03b4 = 3 = floor(7/2) and is not Hamiltonian.\n\nSanity checks on small n\n- n = 3: \u03b4 \u2265 2 forces G = K3, Hamiltonian.\n- n = 4: \u03b4 \u2265 2. Examples: C4 (Hamiltonian), K4 minus a matching (Hamiltonian). No counterexamples exist.\n- n = 5: \u03b4 \u2265 3. Example: K5 minus two disjoint edges, Hamiltonian. Balanced bipartite K_{2,3} has \u03b4 = 2 < 3 and is not Hamiltonian, consistent.\n\nAlternative direct Dirac-style proof skeleton (for later writeup)\n- Assume G not Hamiltonian and let C be a longest cycle of length c. Then there exists a vertex w outside C. Show that w has at least two neighbors on C at distance at least 2 apart along C using \u03b4 \u2265 n/2, and splice to form a longer cycle, contradicting maximality. This approach avoids closure and uses rotation\u2013extension; to be completed in a polished writeup if desired.\n\nStatus\n- We now have a complete, local-lemma-based proof pipeline (via Bondy\u2013Chv\u00e1tal closure) with explicit lemmas and checks, and examples showing the bound is tight.\n", "new_files": [], "requests_for_more_materials": ["Confirm we should assume finite, simple, undirected graphs with n \u2265 3 in task.tex and adjust the task statement accordingly.", "Do you prefer the closure-based proof (as above) or a direct Dirac longest-cycle proof in the final writeup?", "Any constraints on citing named results?
