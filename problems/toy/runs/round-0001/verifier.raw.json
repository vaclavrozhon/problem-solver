The combinatorial heart (path-closing lemma from a Hamiltonian path under a degree-sum ≥ n) is stated and proved carefully enough in both reports. I checked edge cases and indexing: with a minor tidy-up on the index ranges, both versions are rigorous.\\n\\nKey checks and minor nits:\\n- 2-connectivity from δ ≥ n/2: Your counting proof is standard and correct. It may help to state explicitly that every component of G − v must have size ≥ n/2, forcing a+b ≥ n against a+b = n−1.\\n- Path-closing lemma: Both versions are correct. For absolute clarity, note explicitly that (with u = x0, v = x_{n−1}) A ⊆ {1,…,n−2} and B ⊆ {2,…,n−1}, so any i in A ∩ B automatically lies in {2,…,n−2}. Prover 02’s S/T formulation is also fine; just make the neighbor–index bijection explicit.\\n- Closure step: Your equivalence (G Hamiltonian iff G+uv Hamiltonian) is correct and fully justified by the path-closing lemma. The iterative argument to K_n is solid since degrees only increase.\\n- Sharpness: The K_{k−1,k+1} and K_{k,k+1} families are correct; also the remark that K_{m,m} is Hamiltonian for m ≥ 2 is important to avoid a common misconception.\\n- Claim about two common neighbors from a large degree sum is correct but not used in the closure proof. Keep it if you also include a direct Pósa/Ore-style proof; otherwise it can be trimmed.\\n- Small-n edge cases: Prover 02’s Claim 0 is sensible; state n ≥ 3 up front.\\n\\n3-row table:\\n| Claim (short) | Status [OK/Unclear/Broken] | Why |\\n| — | — | — |\\n| δ ≥ n/2 ⇒ 2-connected | OK | Standard component-size counting yields contradiction a+b = n−1 ≥ n. |\\n| Path-closing lemma (deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n) | OK | Pigeonhole on adjacency indices; constructed cycle uses only G-edges; indexing clean with explicit ranges. |\\n| Closure ⇒ Dirac | OK | Single-edge equivalence preserves Hamiltonicity; δ ≥ n/2 lets us add all nonedges to reach K_n. |\\n\\nValue triage: High. The pipeline is clean, self-contained, and standard. The only polish needed is index normalization (x0..x_{n−1} vs x1..xn) and a compact, final LaTeX writeup.\\n\\nTargeted notes:\\n- Prover 01: Very clear path-closing construction; keep the explicit listing of used edges. You can drop Claim 2 unless using it later.\\n- Prover 02: Good normalization and small-n discussion. If you mention counterexamples at δ ≥ floor(n/2) with cut-vertices, either give a concrete construction or omit the aside.\",\n  \"summary_md\": \"- Both reports give a correct, complete proof of Dirac via the Bondy–Chvátal single-edge closure; core lemmas check out.\\n- 2-connectivity from δ ≥ n/2 is proved correctly via component-size counting; keep this as a short preliminary.\\n- The path-closing lemma is sound; clarify the neighbor–index bijection and index ranges to avoid off-by-one worries.\\n- The closure equivalence (G Hamiltonian iff G+uv Hamiltonian for deg-sum ≥ n) is correctly deduced; iteration to K_n is valid since degrees only increase.\\n- Sharpness examples K_{k−1,k+1} (even n) and K_{k,k+1} (odd n) are correct; avoid citing K_{k,k} as a counterexample.\\n- Minor polish: unify indexing (x0..x_{n−1} or x1..xn) across lemmas; state n ≥ 3 explicitly.\\n- Optional: include the direct Pósa/Ore-style proof as a cross-check; then Claim on two common neighbors becomes relevant.\\n- Next steps: produce the clean LaTeX writeup of Lemma (path-closing), single-edge closure, and Dirac via closure; add sharpness and small-n sanity checks.\",\n  \"verdict\": \"promising\",\n  \"blocking_issues\": [],\n  \"per_prover\": [\n    {\n      \"prover_id\": \"01\",\n      \"brief_feedback\": \"Strong, clean closure-based proof.
