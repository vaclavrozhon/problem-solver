{"feedback_md":"Both reports converge on the same correct and classical closure-based proof of Dirac’s theorem, and the technical core (the path-closing lemma and the single-edge closure equivalence) is handled carefully. I audited each step for boundary/index issues and unchecked assumptions:\n\n- Connectivity and 2-connectivity lemmas: Both are correct. The key inequalities are sound: in a disconnected graph the smallest component has size s ≤ floor((n−1)/2), so a vertex in it has degree ≤ s−1 < n/2; in the cut-vertex case, a vertex in the smallest component of G−w has degree ≤ s (neighbors in its component plus possibly w) and s ≤ floor((n−1)/2) < n/2. No gaps.\n\n- Path-closing lemma: Both versions are valid. Prover 01 uses the shifted set B′ so that |A| + |B′| = deg(u) + deg(v), and notes disjointness unless a Hamiltonian cycle already exists. Prover 02 uses A and B with indices offset by one and bounds |A|+|B| ≤ n−1 unless some index triggers the cycle. The delicate points are (i) explicitly excluding uv ∈ E at the outset (otherwise the path closes immediately), and (ii) justifying |A| = deg(u) and |B| = deg(v) by noting that, with uv ∉ E and P Hamiltonian, all neighbors of u and v lie among the interior vertices x1,…,x_{n−2}. Both reports state this; I retained the explicit indexing in the curated proof.\n\n- Single-edge closure equivalence: Correct and uses the path-closing lemma precisely in the needed direction (removing uv from a Hamiltonian cycle in G+uv yields a Hamiltonian path in G with endpoints u,v; the degree-sum condition is in G). This is the essential equivalence for iterative closure.\n\n- Iteration to K_n under δ ≥ n/2: Sound. Degrees only increase, so the “Ore-eligible” condition persists; adding all nonedges yields K_n, which is Hamiltonian for n ≥ 3.\n\n- Sharpness examples: Both even and odd n examples are correct and well-justified by bipartiteness (cycles are even). These are useful to include as a “sharpness” proposition.\n\nMinor refinement: In the path-closing lemma, it is cleanest to state “If uv ∈ E we are done; otherwise define A,B and note |A|+|B| = deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, but |A|+|B| ≤ n−1 unless the desired pair of edges occurs; hence a cycle exists.” This avoids a slight logical hiccup of appealing to disjointness as if already known.\n\nI have curated: (i) connectivity and 2-connectivity consequences, (ii) the path-closing lemma, (iii) the single-edge closure equivalence, (iv) the closure-to-K_n step, and (v) Dirac’s theorem with proofs, plus a sharpness proposition. All are self-contained under the stated setup n ≥ 3, finite simple graphs.\n\nPromising next steps:\n- Prove Ore’s theorem as an immediate corollary of the single-edge equivalence (no need to iterate to K_n).\n- Prove the full Bondy–Chvátal closure theorem (Hamiltonicity is equivalent to Hamiltonicity of the closure cl(G)). This generalizes our single-edge step and subsumes both Dirac and Ore.\n- Record the common-neighbor corollary under δ ≥ n/2: any two nonadjacent vertices have at least two common neighbors (useful for rotation-extension). I noted this in the notes.\n- Optional: Extend to pancyclicity (Bondy): if δ(G) ≥ n/2, then G is either pancyclic or is K_{n/2,n/2}. Also consider a constructive algorithm for finding a Hamiltonian cycle via closures and the path-closing lemma.\n","new_notes_md":"Refinements and recorded tools for the closure route to Dirac\n\nSetting: Finite, simple, undirected graphs on n = |V(G)| ≥ 3; δ(G) is minimum degree. We index Hamiltonian paths as P = x_0,x_1,…,x_{n−1} with u = x_0 and v = x_{n−1}.\n\nPath-closing lemma (indexing we will use): If P is Hamiltonian and deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, then G has a Hamiltonian cycle. If uv ∈ E, the path closes immediately. Otherwise define\n- A = { i ∈ {1,…,n−2} : u is adjacent to x_i },\n- B = { i ∈ {2,…,n−1} : v is adjacent to x_{i−1} }.\nBecause P spans all vertices and uv ∉ E, |A| = deg(u) and |B| = deg(v). For i ∈ {2,…,n−2}, the simultaneous occurrence i ∈ A ∩ B yields the Hamiltonian cycle u−x_i−…−v−x_{i−1}−…−u. If A ∩ B = ∅, then |A|+|B| ≤ (n−3) + 1 + 1 = n−1, contradicting deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n. Hence A ∩ B ≠ ∅ and the cycle exists.\n\nSingle-edge closure equivalence: If uv ∉ E(G) with deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, then G is Hamiltonian iff G+uv is Hamiltonian. The backward direction uses the path-closing lemma after removing uv from a Hamiltonian cycle in G+uv.\n\nClosure under δ ≥ n/2: If δ(G) ≥ n/2, every nonedge uv satisfies deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n. Adding all such nonedges (degrees only increase) yields K_n. By the equivalence at each step, Hamiltonicity is preserved.\n\nImmediate consequences recorded\n- Connectivity: δ ≥ n/2 ⇒ G is connected.\n- 2-connectivity: δ ≥ n/2 ⇒ G has no cut-vertex.\n- Common neighbors under δ ≥ n/2: For nonadjacent u,v, |N(u)∪N(v)| ≤ n−2, so |N(u)∩N(v)| ≥ deg(u)+deg(v) − (n−2) ≥ 2. Thus any nonadjacent pair has at least two common neighbors. Useful for rotation–extension arguments.\n\nSharpness: For even n=2k, K_{k−1,k+1} has δ = k−1 = n/2−1 and is non-Hamiltonian (bipartite imbalance). For odd n=2k+1, K_{k,k+1} has δ = k = ⌊n/2⌋ and is non-Hamiltonian (all cycles even). Thus Dirac’s bound can’t be lowered.\n\nWhat’s next\n- Add Ore’s theorem as a corollary of the single-edge equivalence (no full closure needed).\n- Prove the full Bondy–Chvátal closure theorem cl(G) is Hamiltonian iff G is.\n- Optional: Pancyclicity strengthening (Bondy) under δ ≥ n/2, and a constructive extraction of a Hamiltonian cycle via closure plus the path-closing lemma.\n","new_notes_append":"True","new_outputs_md":"Definitions and standing assumptions\n- Graphs are finite, simple, undirected. Let n = |V(G)| ≥ 3. Write δ(G) for the minimum degree. A Hamiltonian path/cycle is a path/cycle on all n vertices.\n\nProposition 1 (Connectivity). If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then G is connected.\nProof. Suppose G is disconnected, and let C be a smallest component with |C| = s. Any v ∈ C has deg(v) ≤ s−1. If s ≤ n/2 then deg(v) ≤ n/2−1 < n/2, contradicting δ(G) ≥ n/2. Hence s ≥ n/2+1, but then the union of two components already has more than n vertices, a contradiction. ∎\n\nProposition 2 (2-connectivity). If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then G has no cut-vertex.\nProof. Suppose w is a cut-vertex. Let the components of G−w be H_1,…,H_t with t ≥ 2, and set s = min_i |V(H_i)|. For any x in a smallest component, x has neighbors only within that component and possibly w, so deg(x) ≤ (s−1)+1 = s. Since s ≤ (n−1)/2, we get deg(x) ≤ (n−1)/2 < n/2, contradicting δ(G) ≥ n/2. ∎\n\nLemma 3 (Path-closing). Let P = x_0,x_1,…,x_{n−1} be a Hamiltonian path in G with endpoints u = x_0 and v = x_{n−1}. If deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, then G has a Hamiltonian cycle.\nProof. If uv ∈ E(G), adding uv closes P into a Hamiltonian cycle. Assume uv ∉ E(G). Define\nA = { i ∈ {1,…,n−2} : u is adjacent to x_i },\nB = { i ∈ {2,…,n−1} : v is adjacent to x_{i−1} }.\nBecause P spans all vertices and uv ∉ E(G), every neighbor of u (resp. v) lies among x_1,…,x_{n−2}, so |A| = deg(u) and |B| = deg(v). For i ∈ {2,…,n−2}, if both u∼x_i and v∼x_{i−1} hold (i.e., i ∈ A ∩ B), then the cycle\nu, x_i, x_{i+1}, …, x_{n−1}(=v), x_{i−1}, x_{i−2}, …, x_0(=u)\nuses edges of P plus the two chords and spans all vertices. If A ∩ B = ∅, then among the (n−3) indices i ∈ {2,…,n−2} at most one of i ∈ A or i ∈ B can occur each time, and additionally index 1 can contribute only to A and index n−1 only to B. Hence |A|+|B| ≤ (n−3)+1+1 = n−1, contradicting deg(u)+deg(v) = |A|+|B| ≥ n. Therefore A ∩ B ≠ ∅ and the Hamiltonian cycle exists. ∎\n\nLemma 4 (Single-edge closure equivalence). Let uv ∉ E(G) with deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, and let G′ = G + uv. Then G is Hamiltonian if and only if G′ is Hamiltonian.\nProof. If G is Hamiltonian then so is the supergraph G′. Conversely, suppose G′ has a Hamiltonian cycle. If the cycle avoids uv, it is a Hamiltonian cycle of G. If it uses uv, then deleting uv yields a Hamiltonian path in G with endpoints u and v; apply Lemma 3 to conclude that G is Hamiltonian. ∎\n\nLemma 5 (Closure to K_n under δ ≥ n/2). If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then for every nonedge {u,v} we have deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n. Iteratively adding all such nonedges yields K_n.\nProof. Under δ(G) ≥ n/2, any two vertices satisfy deg(u) ≥ n/2 and deg(v) ≥ n/2, so deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n. Adding a nonedge can only increase degrees, so the degree-sum condition persists for remaining nonedges. After finitely many additions, all nonedges are added and the resulting graph is K_n. ∎\n\nTheorem 6 (Dirac’s theorem). Let G be a graph on n ≥ 3 vertices. If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then G is Hamiltonian.\nProof. By Lemma 5 we may add all nonedges with degree-sum at least n to obtain K_n. By Lemma 4, Hamiltonicity is preserved (equivalently) at each addition, so G is Hamiltonian if and only if K_n is. Since K_n has a Hamiltonian cycle for n ≥ 3, G is Hamiltonian. ∎\n\nProposition 7 (Sharpness of the bound). The threshold n/2 cannot be lowered.\n(a) For even n = 2k, the graph K_{k−1, k+1} has δ = k−1 = n/2−1 and is not Hamiltonian (a Hamiltonian cycle in a bipartite graph must alternate evenly, impossible with parts of different sizes).\n(b) For odd n = 2k+1, the graph K_{k, k+1} has δ = k = ⌊n/2⌋ and is not Hamiltonian (all cycles in bipartite graphs are even, but n is odd).\nThus the bound n/2 is best possible up to rounding. ∎\n","new_outputs_append":"True","verdict":"success"}
