For $x\\\\in V$ we write $\\\\deg_G(x)$ (often simply $\\\\deg(x)$) for its degree in $G$, and $\\\\delta(G)=\\\\min\\\\{\\\\deg_G(x):x\\\\in V\\\\}$ for the minimum degree. A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits every vertex once; a Hamiltonian path is a path that visits every vertex once.\\n\\nThe main aim is to prove the following classical result of Dirac by the closure method of Bondy--Chv\\\\'atal.\\n\\n\\\\begin{theorem}[Dirac]\\n\\\\label{thm:dirac}\\nLet $G$ be a simple graph on $n\\\\ge 3$ vertices.

An appendix sketches the direct P\\\\'osa/Ore method.\\n\\n\\\\section{Preliminaries: connectivity and 2-connectivity}\\nWe first record two easy but useful consequences of a large minimum degree.\\n\\n\\\\begin{proposition}[Connectivity and 2-connectivity]\\n\\\\label{prop:conn-2conn}\\nLet $G$ be a simple graph on $n\\\\ge 3$ vertices.\\n\\\\begin{enumerate}[label=(\\\\roman*)]\\n  \\\\item If $\\\\delta(G)\\\\ge 1$ then $G$ has no isolated vertex; in particular if $\\\\delta(G)\\\\ge n/2$ then $G$ is connected.\\n  \\\\item If $\\\\delta(G)\\\\ge n/2$ then $G$ is $2$-connected (i.e. has no cut-vertex).\\n\\\\end{enumerate}\\n\\\\end{proposition}\\n\\n\\\\begin{proof}\\n(i) The statement about isolated vertices is immediate. For connectedness under $\\\\delta(G)\\\\ge n/2$: suppose for contradiction that $G$ is disconnected. Choose a component $C$ with $r$ vertices. Since there are at least two components we have $r\\\\le n/2$. Every vertex of $C$ has all its neighbors inside $C$, so its degree is at most $r-1\\\\le n/2-1$, contradicting $\\\\delta(G)\\\\ge n/2$. Thus $G$ is connected.\\n\\n(ii) Suppose $G$ has a cut-vertex $v$. Then $G-v$ has at least two components; let $C$ be one of them and let $r=|V(C)|$ be its size. Since there are at least two components in $G-v$ we have $r\\\\le (n-1)/2$. Any vertex $w\\\\in V(C)$ can be adjacent only to vertices in $C$ and possibly to $v$, so $\\\\deg_G(w)\\\\le r\\\\le (n-1)/2<n/2$, contradicting $\\\\delta(G)\\\\ge n/2$. Hence no cut-vertex can exist and $G$ is $2$-connected.\\n\\\\end{proof}\\n\\n\\\\begin{remark}\\nThese simple observations are standard; they are sometimes used as preliminary reductions in other proofs of Dirac's theorem. We will not rely heavily on 2-connectivity below, but it is convenient to have this fact recorded.\\n\\\\end{remark}\\n\\n\\\\section{A precise path-closing lemma}\\nThe following lemma is the central combinatorial observation used in the closure-based proof. The statement below fixes a convenient unified indexing of the vertices of a Hamiltonian path and defines two index-sets whose intersection (guaranteed by a degree-sum condition) allows one to \\\"splice\\\" the path into a Hamiltonian cycle.\\n\\n\\\\begin{lemma}[Path-closing lemma]\\n\\\\label{lem:path-close}\\nLet $G$ be a simple graph on $n\\\\ge 3$ vertices. Suppose $P=x_0x_1\\\\dots x_{n-1}$ is a Hamiltonian path of $G$, and write $u:=x_0$, $v:=x_{n-1}$ for its endpoints. Define the index-sets\\n\\\\[\\nA:=\\\\{\\\\,i\\\\in\\\\{1,\\\\dots,n-2\\\\}: u\\\\sim x_i\\\\,\\\\},\\\\qquad\\nB:=\\\\{\\\\,i\\\\in\\\\{2,\\\\dots,n-1\\\\}: v\\\\sim x_{i-1}\\\\,\\\\}.\\n\\\\]\\n(Equivalently, $A$ indexes the interior vertices adjacent to $u$, and $B$ indexes the interior vertices whose successor along $P$ is adjacent to $v$.)\\n\\nIf $\\\\deg_G(u)+\\\\deg_G(v)\\\\ge n$ then either $uv\\\\in E(G)$ or $A\\\\cap B\\\\neq\\\\emptyset$. Moreover, if $i\\\\in A\\\\cap B$ then the cycle\\n\\\\[\\nC:=x_0\\\\;x_i\\\\;x_{i+1}\\\\;\\\\dots\\\\;x_{n-1}\\\\;x_{i-1}\\\\;x_{i-2}\\\\;\\\\dots\\\\;x_1\\\\;x_0\\n\\\\]\\nis a Hamiltonian cycle of $G$.\\n\\\\end{lemma}\\n\\n\\\\begin{proof}\\nIf $uv\\\\in E(G)$ then $P$ together with the edge $uv$ already forms a Hamiltonian cycle and we are done. Assume therefore that $uv\\\\notin E(G)$.\\n\\nBecause $P$ is a Hamiltonian path, every neighbor of $u$ except possibly $v$ lies among $x_1,\\\\dots,x_{n-2}$, and by definition the neighbors of $u$ among those interior vertices are exactly counted by $A$. Since we have assumed $uv\\\\notin E(G)$, it follows that\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\deg_G(u)=|A|.\\n\\\\]\\nSimilarly, every neighbor of $v$ except possibly $u$ lies among $x_1,\\\\dots,x_{n-2}$; the set $B'=\\\\{j\\\\in\\\\{1,\\\\dots,n-2\\\\}: v\\\\sim x_j\\\\}$ records those interior neighbors, and $B=\\\\{j+1:j\\\\in B'\\\\}$ is just a shifted copy of $B'$. Because $uv\\\\notin E(G)$ we have\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\deg_G(v)=|B|.\\n\\\\]\\nThus the hypothesis $\\\\deg_G(u)+\\\\deg_G(v)\\\\ge n$ becomes\\n\\\\[\\n|A|+|B|\\\\ge n.\\\\qquad(\\\\ast)\\n\\\\]\\nNote that $A\\\\subseteq\\\\{1,\\\\dots,n-2\\\\}$ and $B\\\\subseteq\\\\{2,\\\\dots,n-1\\\\}$; hence $A\\\\cup B\\\\subseteq\\\\{1,2,\\\\dots,n-1\\\\}$, a set of size $n-1$. If $A\\\\cap B=\\\\emptyset$ then $|A|+|B|=|A\\\\cup B|\\\\le n-1$, contradicting $(\\\\ast)$. Therefore $A\\\\cap B\\\\neq\\\\emptyset$.\\n\\nLet $i\\\\in A\\\\cap B$. By the definitions of $A$ and $B$ we have $u\\\\sim x_i$ and $v\\\\sim x_{i-1}$. Consider the closed walk\\n\\\\[\\nx_0(=u),\\\\;x_i,\\\\;x_{i+1},\\\\;\\\\dots,\\\\;x_{n-1}(=v),\\\\;x_{i-1},\\\\;x_{i-2},\\\\;\\\\dots,\\\\;x_1,\\\\;x_0.\\n\\\\]\\nEvery consecutive pair in this sequence is an edge of $G$: edges between $x_j$ and $x_{j+1}$ are edges of the original path $P$, and the edges $ux_i$ and $x_{i-1}v$ are present by choice of $i$. The walk visits every vertex exactly once before returning to $x_0$, hence it is a Hamiltonian cycle of $G$, as required.\\n\\\\end{proof}\\n\\n\\\\section{Single-edge closure equivalence and the iterative closure}\\nWe now formalize the key operation used in Bondy--Chv\\\\'atal closure and derive the fundamental equivalence statement.\\n\\n\\\\begin{definition}[Single-edge closure]\\nLet $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices and let $u,v\\\\in V(G)$ be nonadjacent.

Then $G$ is Hamiltonian if and only if $G+uv$ is Hamiltonian.\\n\\\\end{proposition}\\n\\n\\\\begin{proof}\\nIf $G$ is Hamiltonian then trivially $G+uv$ is Hamiltonian. Conversely, suppose $G+uv$ has a Hamiltonian cycle $C$. If $C$ does not use the edge $uv$ then $C$ is already a Hamiltonian cycle of $G$. Otherwise $C$ uses the edge $uv$; removing the edge $uv$ from $C$ yields a Hamiltonian path $P$ of $G$ with endpoints $u$ and $v$. Apply Lemma~\\\\ref{lem:path-close} to this path $P$: since $\\\\deg_G(u)+\\\\deg_G(v)\\\\ge n$ we obtain either $uv\\\\in E(G)$ (contradiction, as we assumed $u$ and $v$ were nonadjacent in $G$) or there exists an index $i$ giving the Hamiltonian cycle\\n\\\\[\\nx_0\\\\;x_i\\\\;x_{i+1}\\\\;\\\\dots\\\\;x_{n-1}\\\\;x_{i-1}\\\\;\\\\dots\\\\;x_1\\\\;x_0\\n\\\\]\\ninside $G$. Thus $G$ itself contains a Hamiltonian cycle, completing the equivalence.\\n\\\\end{proof}\\n\\n\\\\begin{definition}[Bondy--Chv\\\\'atal closure]\\nGiven a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, repeatedly choose a pair of distinct nonadjacent vertices $u,v$ with $\\\\deg(u)+\\\\deg(v)\\\\ge n$ and add the edge $uv$; continue until no such pair remains.

(It is a standard fact that the final graph is independent of the order of choices; we do not need to use that fact here.)\\n\\\\end{definition}\\n\\nBy Proposition~\\\\ref{prop:single-edge-equivalence}, every single addition of an allowed edge preserves the property of being Hamiltonian.

Conversely, suppose $G+uv$ has a Hamiltonian cycle $C$. If $C$ does not use the edge $uv$ then $C$ is already a Hamiltonian cycle of $G$. Otherwise $C$ uses the edge $uv$; removing the edge $uv$ from $C$ yields a Hamiltonian path $P$ of $G$ with endpoints $u$ and $v$.

Repeating this argument for each step of the process (finitely many steps) shows that $G$ is Hamiltonian iff the final graph $\\\\cl(G)$ is Hamiltonian.\\n\\\\end{proof}\\n\\n\\\\section{Proof of Dirac's theorem via closure}\\nWe now apply the closure machinery to deduce Dirac's theorem immediately.\\n\\n\\\\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\\\\ref{thm:dirac}]\\nAssume $\\\\delta(G)\\\\ge n/2$. Let $u,v$ be any two vertices of $G$. Then\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\deg_G(u)+\\\\deg_G(v)\\\\ge 2\\\\delta(G)\\\\ge n.\\n\\\\]\\nHence every pair of nonadjacent vertices satisfies the closure condition. Therefore when one performs the Bondy--Chv\\\\'atal closure process on $G$, every missing edge will be eligible to be added (from the start); iteratively adding all such edges yields the complete graph $K_n$, so one possible closure is $\\\\cl(G)=K_n$. Since $K_n$ is Hamiltonian and by Corollary~\\\\ref{cor:closure-equiv} closure preserves Hamiltonicity, it follows that $G$ itself is Hamiltonian. This completes the proof.\\n\\\\end{proof}\\n\\n\\\\section{Sharpness of the bound}\\nWe show that the bound $\\\\delta(G)\\\\ge n/2$ in Dirac's theorem is best possible by providing natural non-Hamiltonian graphs whose minimum degree is just below $n/2$.\\n\\n\\\\begin{proposition}[Sharpness examples]\\n\\\\label{prop:sharp}\\n\\\\begin{enumerate}[label=(\\\\alph*)]\\n  \\\\item For even $n=2k\\\\ (k\\\\ge 2)$ the complete bipartite graph $K_{k-1,k+1}$ has $\\\\delta= k-1= n/2-1$ and is not Hamiltonian.\\n  \\\\item For odd $n=2k+1\\\\ (k\\\\ge 1)$ the complete bipartite graph $K_{k,k+1}$ has $\\\\delta=k=\\\\lfloor n/2\\\\rfloor$ and is not Hamiltonian.\\n\\\\end{enumerate}\\nIn both cases the graphs are bipartite with parts of unequal size, so they do not contain a Hamiltonian cycle that visits all $n$ vertices.\\n\\\\end{proposition}\\n\\n\\\\begin{proof}\\nIn a bipartite graph every cycle has even length, visiting equally many vertices from each bipartition. In case (a), $K_{k-1,k+1}$ has $n=2k$ vertices but the two parts have sizes $k-1$ and $k+1$, so any cycle can include at most $2(k-1)=n-2$ vertices; hence no Hamiltonian cycle exists. The minimum degree is $\\\\min(k-1,k+1)=k-1=n/2-1$. In case (b), $K_{k,k+1}$ has an odd total number of vertices $2k+1$, and no bipartite graph with an odd number of vertices can have a cycle that visits all vertices (since every cycle has even length). The minimum degree is $\\\\min(k,k+1)=k=\\\\lfloor n/2\\\\rfloor$. Thus both families exhibit that the $n/2$ threshold cannot be lowered.\\n\\\\end{proof}\\n\\n\\\\section{Small-$n$ sanity checks}\\nA few trivial checks for small $n$ are instructive:\\n\\\\begin{itemize}\\n  \\\\item $n=3$: The condition $\\\\delta\\\\ge n/2$ forces $\\\\delta\\\\ge 3/2$, hence $\\\\delta\\\\ge 2$. The only simple graph with three vertices and minimum degree $2$ is $K_3$, which is Hamiltonian.\\n  \\\\item $n=4$: If $\\\\delta\\\\ge 2$ then for any two vertices $u,v$ we have $\\\\deg(u)+\\\\deg(v)\\\\ge 4$, so every nonadjacent pair satisfies the closure condition and the closure is $K_4$; hence $G$ is Hamiltonian. One can also check case-by-case that no counterexamples exist.\\n\\\\end{itemize}\\nThese checks are consistent with Theorem~\\\\ref{thm:dirac}.\\n\\n\\\\section{Concluding remarks}\\nThe closure-based proof given above is concise and conceptually clean: one verifies a local operation that preserves Hamiltonicity, and observes that under Dirac's degree hypothesis the closure is the complete graph, which is trivially Hamiltonian. The closure method of Bondy and Chv\\\\'atal is more general and yields the broader closure theorem (Corollary~\\\\ref{cor:closure-equiv} together with the observation that closure does not depend on the order of additions), and it interpolates between Dirac's theorem and Ore's theorem.\\n\\n\\\\appendix\\n\\\\section{Appendix: sketch of the direct P\\\\'osa/Ore approach}\\nWe sketch the more direct line of argument (often attributed to P\\\\'osa and Ore) that can also be used to prove Dirac's theorem without explicitly invoking closure. Two common formulations are:\\n\\\\begin{itemize}\\n  \\\\item Ore's theorem: if a graph $G$ on $n\\\\ge 3$ vertices satisfies $\\\\deg(x)+\\\\deg(y)\\\\ge n$ for every pair of distinct nonadjacent vertices $x,y$, then $G$ is Hamiltonian. Dirac's theorem is an immediate corollary since $\\\\delta\\\\ge n/2$ implies the Ore condition.\\n  \\\\item P\\\\'osa's rotation-extension method: choose a longest path and attempt to extend it by \\\"rotations\\\" at one endpoint; degree conditions force a contradiction unless the path is Hamiltonian.\\n\\\\end{itemize}\\n\\nA brief sketch of a standard proof of Ore's theorem is as follows. Suppose $G$ satisfies the Ore condition and is not Hamiltonian. Let $P=v_0v_1\\\\dots v_t$ be a longest path in $G$ (so $t\\\\le n-1$ and every neighbor of $v_0$ or $v_t$ lies on $P$). Since $P$ is maximal, for every index $i$ with $1\\\\le i\\\\le t$ we cannot both have $v_0\\\\sim v_i$ and $v_t\\\\sim v_{i-1}$, because otherwise the edges $v_0v_i$ and $v_{i-1}v_t$ together with segments of $P$ would produce a cycle or a longer path contradicting maximality. Thus the sets\\n\\\\[\\nA=\\\\{i\\\\in[1,t]:v_0\\\\sim v_i\\\\},\\\\quad B=\\\\{i\\\\in[1,t]:v_t\\\\sim v_{i-1}\\\\}\\n\\\\]\\nare (essentially) disjoint subsets of $\\\\{1,\\\\dots,t\\\\}$, and by counting one deduces $\\\\deg(v_0)+\\\\deg(v_t)\\\\le t\\\\le n-1$, contradicting the Ore hypothesis $\\\\deg(v_0)+\\\\deg(v_t)\\\\ge n$. This contradiction shows $G$ must be Hamiltonian. The full details require a careful handling of indices and the possibility of forming cycles and extending paths, but they follow the same combinatorial pattern as the path-closing lemma used above.\\n\\nBoth the closure method presented in the main text and the P\\\\'osa/Ore approaches are classical and useful: the closure method is flexible (it can be used to reduce many Hamiltonicity problems to checking the complete graph), and the rotation-extension method is constructive and often used in extremal and probabilistic settings.\\n\\n\\\\section*{Acknowledgements}\\nNo external references were needed beyond naming Bondy--Chv\\\\'atal; the presentation aims to be elementary and self-contained.\\n\\n\\\\end{document}\\n\",\"errors_md\":\"\"}"
