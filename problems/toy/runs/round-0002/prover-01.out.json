  "progress_md": "## Audit of output.md (correctness and small refinements)\n- The curated proof establishes Dirac\u2019s theorem via the Bondy\u2013Chv\u00e1tal single\u2011edge step and is logically sound. The path\u2011closing lemma\u2019s indexing and the equivalence step (Lemma 4) are correct and sufficient for the iterative closure to K_n under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2.\n- Proposition 1 (connectivity): The final sentence can be made explicit: if the smallest component has size s \u2265 n/2+1 and there are \u22652 components, then two components together have at least 2s \u2265 n+2 vertices, impossible. The argument as written is correct but could state \u201ctwo components\u201d more explicitly.\n- Proposition 2 (2\u2011connectivity): The bound s \u2264 \u230a(n\u22121)/2\u230b follows since the sum of component sizes of G\u2212w is n\u22121 with at least two components. The current proof is fine.\n- Lemma 3 (path\u2011closing): The counting inequality |A|+|B| \u2264 n\u22121 under A\u2229B=\u2205 is accurate; the justification |A|=deg(u), |B|=deg(v) is correct because uv \u2209 E and P is Hamiltonian. No gaps detected.\n\n## New, small results to add (useful corollaries and generalizations)\n1) Common neighbors and diameter under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2\n- Corollary (\u22652 common neighbors): If \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2 and u,v are nonadjacent, then |N(u)\u2229N(v)| \u2265 2.\n  Proof: N(u), N(v) \u2286 V\\{u,v}, so |N(u)\u222aN(v)| \u2264 n\u22122. Hence |N(u)\u2229N(v)| = deg(u)+deg(v)\u2212|N(u)\u222aN(v)| \u2265 n\u2212(n\u22122) = 2.\n- Corollary (diameter \u2264 2): Under \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2, any two vertices are adjacent or have a common neighbor, hence diam(G) \u2264 2. (This follows from the previous inequality with \u201c\u22651\u201d as well.)\n\n2) Ore\u2019s theorem (record as a stand\u2011alone consequence of Lemma 4)\n- Theorem (Ore): If for every nonadjacent u,v we have deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n, then G is Hamiltonian.\n  Proof: Enumerate all nonedges and add them one\u2011by\u2011one. At each step, Lemma 4 applies (the degree\u2011sum condition is measured in the current graph) and preserves Hamiltonicity equivalence. The final graph is K_n, which is Hamiltonian, so the original G is Hamiltonian.\n  Why useful here: Dirac is an immediate corollary of Ore since \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 implies every nonedge satisfies the Ore condition.\n\n3) Full closure equivalence (Bondy\u2013Chv\u00e1tal) \u2014 compact statement and proof\n- Theorem (Closure equivalence): Let cl(G) be obtained by iteratively adding nonedges uv with deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n until none remain. Then G is Hamiltonian iff cl(G) is Hamiltonian.\n  Proof: Let G = G_0 \u2286 G_1 \u2286 \u2026 \u2286 G_m = cl(G), where each G_{i+1} = G_i + u_iv_i with deg_{G_i}(u_i)+deg_{G_i}(v_i) \u2265 n. By Lemma 4 applied in G_i, G_i is Hamiltonian iff G_{i+1} is. Induct over i to conclude G is Hamiltonian iff cl(G) is.\n  Why useful: This generalizes the Dirac and Ore arguments and matches the standard literature.\n\n4) Constructive extraction of a Hamiltonian cycle (algorithmic note)\n- Under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2, closure reaches K_n. Fix any Hamiltonian cycle C_m in K_n (e.g., (1,2,\u2026,n,1)). Traverse the added edges in reverse (from K_n back to G). If the current cycle uses the last added edge uv, delete uv to obtain a Hamiltonian path with endpoints u,v and apply the path\u2011closing lemma (in the previous graph) to replace it by a Hamiltonian cycle avoiding uv. If it doesn\u2019t use uv, keep the cycle. This yields a Hamiltonian cycle in the original G. Each step is justified by Lemma 3.\n\n## Examples/sanity checks (beyond those in output.md)\n- Even n: K_{n/2,n/2} has \u03b4 = n/2 and is Hamiltonian; closure adds all intra\u2011part edges (each pair has degree\u2011sum n), ending at K_n, consistent with equivalence.\n- Small n: For n=3, \u03b4 \u2265 2 gives K_3. For n=4, \u03b4 \u2265 2 covers C_4 and K_{2,2}, both Hamiltonian.\n\n## Next steps for outputs.md\n- Optionally append: (i) the \u201c\u22652 common neighbors\u201d and \u201cdiameter \u2264 2\u201d corollaries; (ii) Ore\u2019s theorem with the short proof above; (iii) the Bondy\u2013Chv\u00e1tal closure equivalence statement (compact proof via Lemma 4). These are short and strengthen the exposition without altering the main Dirac proof."
