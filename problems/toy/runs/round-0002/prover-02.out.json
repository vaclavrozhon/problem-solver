All key steps (path\u2011closing lemma, single\u2011edge closure equivalence, iterative augmentation to K_n) are present with correct indexing and boundary handling (n \u2265 3).\n- Connectivity (Prop. 1) and 2\u2011connectivity (Prop. 2) are sound; the inequalities used are tight and standard.\n- Path\u2011closing lemma (Lemma 3): The counting argument is valid. Minor clarity note (not a gap): it helps to explicitly remark that all neighbors of u (resp. v) lie among x_1,\u2026,x_{n\u22122} because the path is Hamiltonian and uv \u2209 E(G); this justifies |A| = deg(u), |B| = deg(v). The proof already indicates this.\n- Single\u2011edge closure equivalence (Lemma 4) is correctly applied with degree sums taken in G (not in G+uv), which is essential.\n- Iteration to K_n (Lemma 5) correctly notes that degrees only increase, so every remaining nonedge remains \u201celigible,\u201d ensuring the equivalence step can be applied throughout.\n- Sharpness examples are correct and well\u2011justified by bipartiteness.\n\nNew, small results to consider curating (each with \u201cwhy useful\u201d) \n1) Ore\u2019s Theorem as an immediate corollary of Lemma 4\n- Statement: If for every nonadjacent u,v in G we have deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n, then G is Hamiltonian.\n- Proof sketch: Iteratively add each nonedge uv (all are eligible by hypothesis). By Lemma 4, Hamiltonicity is preserved at each step, so G is Hamiltonian iff the final graph (K_n) is; hence G is Hamiltonian. \u220e\n- Why useful: It isolates the closure\u2011equivalence as the core engine and shows Dirac follows immediately from Ore (since \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 implies Ore\u2019s condition).\n\n2) At least two common neighbors for nonadjacent vertices under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2\n- Statement: If \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2 and u,v are nonadjacent, then |N(u) \u2229 N(v)| \u2265 2.\n- Proof: |N(u) \u222a N(v)| \u2264 n \u2212 2, so |N(u) \u2229 N(v)| = deg(u)+deg(v) \u2212 |N(u) \u222a N(v)| \u2265 n \u2212 (n \u2212 2) = 2. \u220e\n- Why useful: Strengthens structural understanding; helpful for rotation\u2011extension arguments and implies the next corollary.\n\n3) Diameter bound under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2\n- Statement: If \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2 then diam(G) \u2264 2.\n- Proof: Any nonadjacent pair shares at least one common neighbor (indeed \u2265 2 by the previous lemma), so every pair is at distance \u2264 2. \u220e\n- Why useful: Sanity check and auxiliary tool; often used in alternative Hamiltonicity proofs.\n\nSanity\u2011check example at the threshold\n- Example: For even n, K_{n/2,n/2} satisfies \u03b4 = n/2 and is Hamiltonian (alternate between parts to get an n\u2011cycle). Under the closure process, all nonedges lie within parts and are added (degree\u2011sum = n), producing K_n as expected. Why useful: Confirms correctness exactly at the boundary.\n\nOptional strengthening to record (standard, aligns with Lemma 4)\n4) Bondy\u2013Chv\u00e1tal closure theorem (statement and short justification)\n- Statement: Let cl(G) be obtained by repeatedly adding nonedges uv with deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n until no such pair remains. Then G is Hamiltonian iff cl(G) is Hamiltonian.\n- Justification sketch: Each single addition preserves Hamiltonicity equivalence by Lemma 4; hence any maximal sequence yields a final graph H with G Hamiltonian iff H is. The closure is unique (order\u2011independent) by the monotonicity of the rule (adding eligible edges cannot invalidate eligibility of others). Thus H = cl(G). \u220e\n- Why useful: Conceptual unification; Dirac and Ore are immediate corollaries.\n\nExamples and self\u2011checks\n- Small n: For n = 3, \u03b4 \u2265 2 implies G = K_3, Hamiltonian. For n = 4, \u03b4 \u2265 2 includes C_4 and K_4\u2212e; both are Hamiltonian, consistent with the theorem.\n\nObstacles and delicate points (none blocking)\n- In Lemma 3, the inequality |A|+|B| \u2264 (n\u22123)+1+1 counts the interior indices {2,\u2026,n\u22122} with disjointness unless we already have the desired cycle, plus the endpoint\u2011adjacent indices i = 1 (for A only) and i = n \u2212 1 (for B only). This is correct but easy to miscount; retaining this explicit partition in outputs.md avoids confusion.\n\nNext steps (for outputs.md)\n- Add as Corollaries: (i) Ore\u2019s theorem, (ii) common\u2011neighbor and diameter \u2264 2 lemmas. These are short and self\u2011contained.\n- Optionally add the Bondy\u2013Chv\u00e1tal closure theorem statement with a brief justification referencing Lemma 4.\n- If desired, include a short remark on constructing a Hamiltonian cycle: traverse the closure additions; if the final Hamiltonian cycle uses a newly added edge uv, remove it to get a Hamiltonian path in the previous graph and apply the path\u2011closing lemma; iterate backward to G.\n"
