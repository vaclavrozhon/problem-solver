## Round 0001 — 2025-08-27T14:35:41.823619Z

Status and gaps
- outputs.md was not provided in this round, so I cannot audit what has been formally curated. From the summaries/notes, the planned closure-based proof is the right route, but key steps still need fully written, checkable proofs: (i) the path-closing lemma on a Hamiltonian path under a degree-sum condition; (ii) the single-edge closure equivalence; (iii) the iteration to K_n under δ ≥ n/2; and (iv) brief proofs of connectivity and 2-connectivity under δ ≥ n/2. I supply clean statements and proofs below, aligned with the indexing convention in notes.md, and note any delicate points.

Setup
- Graphs are finite, simple, undirected; n = |V(G)| ≥ 3. A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle through all n vertices.
- Dirac’s theorem target: If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then G is Hamiltonian. This resolves the task in the affirmative.

Ideas (plan of attack)
- Use Bondy–Chvátal-style single-edge closure: nonedge uv with deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n is “safe” to add w.r.t. Hamiltonicity (equivalence). Prove via the path-closing lemma along a Hamiltonian path obtained by removing uv from a Hamiltonian cycle in G+uv.
- Under δ ≥ n/2, every nonedge satisfies the degree-sum condition, so iterating the closure adds all missing edges and yields K_n. Since equivalence holds at each step and K_n is Hamiltonian, G is Hamiltonian.
- Add short lemmas: δ ≥ n/2 implies connected and indeed 2-connected; sharpness examples at δ = ⌈n/2⌉−1.

Key lemmas with proofs (auditable)
1) Connectivity and 2‑connectivity from δ ≥ n/2
- Claim (connectivity): If δ(G) ≥ n/2, G is connected.
  Proof sketch: If disconnected with components of sizes a ≤ b, then any vertex in the smaller component has degree ≤ a−1 ≤ ⌊(n−1)/2⌋ < n/2, contradiction.
- Claim (2‑connectivity): If δ(G) ≥ n/2, G has no cut-vertex.
  Proof sketch: Suppose x is a cut-vertex, and G−x has components of sizes p ≤ q with p+q = n−1. Any vertex u in the smaller component has deg(u) ≤ (p−1)+1 = p ≤ ⌊(n−1)/2⌋ < n/2, contradiction.
  Why useful: Removes earlier misconception about disconnected counterexamples; ensures robust structure for Hamiltonicity arguments.

2) Path‑closing lemma (notes.md indexing)
- Statement: Let G be on n vertices and let P = x_0, x_1, …, x_{n−1} be a Hamiltonian path with endpoints u = x_0 and v = x_{n−1}. If deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, then G has a Hamiltonian cycle.
- Proof: If uv ∈ E(G), we are done. Assume uv ∉ E(G). Define
  A = { i ∈ {1,…,n−2} : u is adjacent to x_i },
  B = { i ∈ {2,…,n−1} : v is adjacent to x_{i−1} }.
  Because P spans all vertices and uv ∉ E, we have |A| = deg(u) and |B| = deg(v) (the indexing omits the impossible end-neighbor). Suppose, for contradiction, that A ∩ B = ∅. Then, for each i ∈ {2,…,n−2}, at most one of the adjacencies u∼x_i or v∼x_{i−1} holds; also, i=1 can contribute to A only and i=n−1 can contribute to B only. Hence |A|+|B| ≤ (n−3)+1+1 = n−1. Therefore deg(u)+deg(v) ≤ n−1, contradicting the hypothesis deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n. Thus A ∩ B ≠ ∅; choose i ∈ A ∩ B. Then u∼x_i and v∼x_{i−1}, and the cycle u, x_i, x_{i+1}, …, x_{n−1}(=v), x_{i−1}, x_{i−2}, …, x_0(=u) uses edges of P plus the two chords and spans all vertices. So G is Hamiltonian. QED.
  Why useful: This is the central combinatorial step used in closure proofs.

3) Single‑edge closure equivalence
- Statement: Let G be on n vertices and uv ∉ E(G) with deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n. Then G is Hamiltonian iff G+uv is Hamiltonian.
- Proof: “⇒” is trivial since adding edges preserves Hamiltonicity. For “⇐”, suppose G+uv has a Hamiltonian cycle. If the cycle avoids uv, it is a Hamiltonian cycle in G. If it uses uv, then removing uv yields a Hamiltonian path in G with endpoints u and v; apply the path‑closing lemma to conclude G is Hamiltonian. QED.
  Why useful: Allows iterative addition of all “Ore-eligible” nonedges while preserving Hamiltonicity equivalence.

4) Iteration to K_n under δ ≥ n/2
- Observation: If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then for any distinct u,v we have deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n. In particular, every nonedge uv meets the hypothesis of the single‑edge closure equivalence.
- Iteration: Enumerate the nonedges uv_1, uv_2, … arbitrarily and add them one-by-one. At each addition, degrees do not decrease, so the degree‑sum condition remains valid for all remaining nonedges. By the equivalence lemma, Hamiltonicity is preserved both ways at each step. When all nonedges are added, the resulting graph is K_n, which is Hamiltonian for n ≥ 3. Hence the original G is Hamiltonian. QED (Dirac).
  Why useful: Completes the closure route from δ ≥ n/2 to Hamiltonicity.

5) Sharpness examples (cannot lower the bound)
- Even n = 2k: Let G = K_{k−1, k+1}. Then δ(G) = k−1 = n/2 − 1. Any Hamiltonian cycle in a bipartite graph must alternate parts, so it uses equal numbers from each part; since the parts have sizes k−1 and k+1, no Hamiltonian cycle exists. Shows the n/2 bound cannot be decreased.
- Odd n = 2k+1: Let G = K_{k, k+1}. Then δ(G) = k = ⌊n/2⌋ < ⌈n/2⌉. By parity/alternation, no Hamiltonian cycle exists (a Hamiltonian cycle would have even length n). Shows that replacing n/2 by ⌊n/2⌋ fails.

Small auxiliary facts (optional but clean)
- Diameter ≤ 2 under δ ≥ n/2: For nonadjacent u,v, |N(u)|+|N(v)| ≥ n, so they share a neighbor; hence dist(u,v) = 2. Not essential, but often used heuristically.
- Longest path bound: Every graph has a path with at least δ(G)+1 vertices. Proof: Let P be a longest path of length ℓ (ℓ+1 vertices). An endpoint x has all neighbors on P, so deg(x) ≤ ℓ. Hence ℓ ≥ δ(G), giving ℓ+1 ≥ δ(G)+1. Not used in the closure route, but consistent with the summaries.

Examples / sanity checks
- n=3: δ ≥ 3/2 ⇒ δ ≥ 2, so G = K_3, which is Hamiltonian. Base case aligns with Dirac.
- Complete bipartite K_{n/2, n/2} (n even): δ = n/2; it is Hamiltonian (indeed has many Hamiltonian cycles). Under closure, every nonedge is within a part and gets added (degree-sum = n), ultimately giving K_n, consistent with the equivalence lemma.

Obstacles / delicate points to watch
- Indexing in the path‑closing lemma: adhering to A = {1,…,n−2} and B = {2,…,n−1} avoids the trivial non-neighbor positions and makes |A|=deg(u), |B|=deg(v) precise. Any writeup should explicitly justify those equalities because they rely on P being Hamiltonian and uv ∉ E.
- Ensure the “equivalence” direction in the closure step is stated and proved; some expositions only show the forward implication, which is not enough for iteration by equivalence.

Next steps (for outputs.md)
- Add the fully written proofs of Lemmas 1–4 above, with the exact indexing as recorded here; this is a complete, rigorous closure-based proof of Dirac’s theorem for n ≥ 3.
- Include the 2-connectivity lemma and both sharpness examples, as brief propositions with proofs.
- Optionally append an Ore/Pósa alternative proof for completeness (not needed for the main result).
- Verify definitions section explicitly states the class of graphs and n ≥ 3 to avoid n=2 edge-case confusion.

## Round 0001 — 2025-08-27T14:35:49.057947Z

Status and gaps
- outputs.md not provided in this round; I assume no curated, fully rigorous proof has yet been recorded. I will propose a clean closure-based proof plan with self-contained lemmas and give complete proofs suitable for outputs.md. I also flag small technical points to watch (endpoints, index ranges, n ≥ 3).

Plan (closure route to Dirac)
- Prove the path-closing lemma: a Hamiltonian path with endpoints u,v and deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n closes to a Hamiltonian cycle. Why useful: it is the local engine for the Bondy–Chvátal single-edge step.
- Deduce the single-edge closure equivalence: adding a nonedge uv with deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n preserves Hamiltonicity (iff). Why useful: allows iterative augmentation without changing Hamiltonicity.
- Under δ(G) ≥ n/2, every nonedge has deg-sum ≥ n, so the iterative closure yields K_n; therefore G is Hamiltonian. Why useful: completes Dirac’s theorem.
- Record connectivity and 2-connectivity consequences of δ ≥ n/2 and sharpness examples. Why useful: prevents false counterexamples and documents optimality of the bound.

Setting
- All graphs are finite, simple, undirected; n = |V(G)| ≥ 3. Write δ(G) for the minimum degree.

Lemma 1 (Connectivity from δ ≥ n/2)
- Claim: If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then G is connected.
- Proof: If G were disconnected, let C be a smallest component, |C| = s. Each v ∈ C has deg(v) ≤ s − 1. If s ≤ n/2 then deg(v) ≤ s − 1 ≤ n/2 − 1 < n/2, contradicting δ ≥ n/2. Hence s ≥ n/2 + 1, but two disjoint components then have ≥ (n/2 + 1) + (n/2 + 1) > n vertices, impossible. ∎

Lemma 2 (2-connectivity from δ ≥ n/2)
- Claim: If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then G has no cut-vertex.
- Proof: Suppose w is a cut-vertex. Let the components of G − w be H_1,…,H_t with t ≥ 2, and let s = min_i |V(H_i)|. For any x ∈ V(H_i) (the smallest one), x has neighbors only in H_i and possibly w, hence deg(x) ≤ (s − 1) + 1 = s. Also s ≤ (n − 1)/2, so deg(x) ≤ (n − 1)/2 < n/2, contradicting δ ≥ n/2. ∎

Lemma 3 (Path-closing lemma)
- Statement: Let G have a Hamiltonian path P = x_0 x_1 … x_{n−1} with endpoints u = x_0 and v = x_{n−1}. If uv ∉ E(G) and deg(u) + deg(v) ≥ n, then G has a Hamiltonian cycle.
- Proof (indexing per notes): Define
  A = { i ∈ {1,…,n−2} : u is adjacent to x_i },
  B = { i ∈ {2,…,n−1} : v is adjacent to x_{i−1} }.
  Because uv ∉ E(G), every neighbor of u lies among {x_1,…,x_{n−2}}, so |A| = deg(u). Likewise, every neighbor of v lies among {x_1,…,x_{n−2}}, so |B| = deg(v) (via the shift i ↦ i − 1).
  For each i ∈ {1,…,n−2}, we cannot have both edges u x_i and v x_{i−1}, because then the cycle
  x_0(=u) — x_i — x_{i+1} — … — x_{n−1}(=v) — x_{i−1} — x_{i−2} — … — x_1 — x_0
  would be a Hamiltonian cycle in G already. Equivalently, A and B′ := {i − 1 : i ∈ B} are disjoint subsets of {1,…,n−2}. Hence |A| + |B′| ≤ n − 2. But |B′| = |B|, so deg(u) + deg(v) = |A| + |B| = |A| + |B′| ≤ n − 2, contradicting deg(u) + deg(v) ≥ n. Therefore some i has both edges present, giving the Hamiltonian cycle as displayed. ∎
- Why useful: This is the core combinatorial step ensuring we can remove a “closure edge” from a Hamiltonian cycle and still recover Hamiltonicity in the original graph.

Lemma 4 (Single-edge closure equivalence)
- Statement: Let uv ∉ E(G) with deg(u) + deg(v) ≥ n, and let G′ = G + uv. Then G is Hamiltonian iff G′ is Hamiltonian.
- Proof: If G is Hamiltonian then so is its supergraph G′. Conversely, suppose G′ has a Hamiltonian cycle C. If C does not use uv, then C ⊆ G and we are done. If C uses uv, delete uv from C to obtain a Hamiltonian path P of G with endpoints u and v. Apply Lemma 3 to P and deg(u) + deg(v) ≥ n to conclude that G has a Hamiltonian cycle. ∎
- Why useful: Allows iterative addition of edges with deg-sum ≥ n without changing Hamiltonicity.

Lemma 5 (Closure to K_n under δ ≥ n/2)
- Claim: If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then for every nonadjacent pair {u,v}, deg(u) + deg(v) ≥ n. Consequently, adding all such nonedges yields K_n.
- Proof: δ(G) ≥ n/2 implies deg(u) ≥ n/2 and deg(v) ≥ n/2 for all u,v, so the sum is ≥ n. Add any nonedge uv; degrees only increase, so at any stage every remaining nonedge still has deg-sum ≥ n. Adding all of them produces a complete graph. ∎
- Why useful: Reduces Dirac to the trivial Hamiltonicity of K_n.

Theorem (Dirac)
- Statement: For n ≥ 3, every graph G with δ(G) ≥ n/2 is Hamiltonian.
- Proof: Iteratively add nonedges with deg-sum ≥ n to obtain K_n (Lemma 5). By Lemma 4, Hamiltonicity is preserved at each addition, so G is Hamiltonian iff K_n is, and K_n is Hamiltonian for n ≥ 3. ∎

Sharpness and examples
- Even n = 2k: The complete bipartite graph K_{k−1, k+1} has δ = k − 1 = n/2 − 1 and is not Hamiltonian (unbalanced bipartite graphs have no spanning cycle). Shows the bound cannot be lowered below n/2.
- Odd n = 2k + 1: K_{k, k+1} has δ = k = ⌊n/2⌋ and is not Hamiltonian (all cycles are even in bipartite graphs). Shows replacing n/2 by ⌊n/2⌋ would be false.

Checks and potential pitfalls
- n ≥ 3 is essential: for n = 2, δ ≥ n/2 = 1 gives K_2, which has no Hamiltonian cycle in simple graphs (no 2-cycles). Our theorem correctly excludes n = 2.
- Indexing in Lemma 3 carefully avoids referring to uv by restricting A to 1,…,n−2 and using the shifted B. The disjointness is proved on A and B′.
- Closure of K_{n/2, n/2} is indeed K_n: nonedges lie within parts, and each such pair has deg-sum = n, so all are added. No contradiction with Dirac (K_{n/2,n/2} itself is Hamiltonian for n ≥ 4).

Alternative route (for appendix)
- One can also derive Dirac via Ore’s theorem (if deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n for all nonadjacent u,v, then G is Hamiltonian), which in turn follows by the same single-edge closure lemma without fully iterating to K_n. Or via Pósa’s rotation-extension method plus a longest-path argument. These are optional and not needed for the main proof.

Next steps
- Curate Lemmas 1–5 and the Dirac theorem proof into outputs.md with explicit statements and proofs as above.
- Optionally add a brief note on 2-connectivity corollary and the sharpness examples.
- If desired, include a short Ore-style proof as an appendix for completeness.

## round-0001 — model summary — 2025-08-26T19:16:25.933680Z
In this round, we explored Dirac's Theorem, which states that a graph with at least 3 vertices is Hamiltonian if every vertex has a degree of at least n/2. However, we identified limitations, including counterexamples where graphs with minimum degree ≥ n/2 are not Hamiltonian, particularly in disconnected graphs. A special case for n=3 was validated, but it does not generalize. The general approach to constructing Hamiltonian cycles from graphs with minimum degree ≥ n/2 requires further exploration and lacks rigor.

## round-0001 — model summary — 2025-08-27T08:24:41.955915Z
Round 0001 fixes the setting (finite, simple, undirected graphs, n ≥ 3) and corrects the earlier misconception: δ(G) ≥ n/2 forces connectivity and in fact 2‑connectivity, so disconnected/cut‑vertex counterexamples are impossible. The prover records and (mostly) proves standard lemmas: connectivity from δ ≥ n/2; sharpness via K_{n/2−1, n/2+1} (or the odd‑n variant); a longest‑path lower bound (there is a path of length ≥ δ+1); and the Bondy–Chvátal single‑edge closure step (if uv is a nonedge with deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, then adding uv preserves Hamiltonicity) proved by a pigeonhole argument along a Hamiltonian path. Iterating the closure yields K_n under δ ≥ n/2, hence Dirac's theorem follows. The verifier flags and corrects one minor error about K_{n/2,n/2} closure. Remaining work is a full formal writeup of the iterative closure (or an optional Ore/longest‑path alternative) and a final LaTeXized proof.

## round-0001 — model summary — 2025-08-27T09:25:35.963680Z
In Round 0001, the focus was on establishing the conditions under which a simple, undirected graph with minimum degree δ(G) ≥ n/2 is Hamiltonian, as per Dirac's theorem. Key lemmas were developed, including connectivity implications, sharpness of the degree bound, and a longest path lower bound. The Bondy–Chvátal closure theorem was introduced as a critical step in proving Hamiltonicity, with a corollary linking it to Dirac's theorem. Special cases were examined, including the case of a cycle of length n−1, and counterexamples were explored to reinforce the established conditions. The round concluded with a plan for a full formal writeup and potential alternative proofs.

Round summary: Prover-01 and Prover-02 supply a complete closure-based proof plan for Dirac's theorem (n = |V| ≥ 3). Key steps: prove the path-closing lemma for a Hamiltonian path P with endpoints u,v (if deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n then P closes to a Hamiltonian cycle); deduce the single-edge closure equivalence (adding a nonedge uv with deg-sum ≥ n preserves Hamiltonicity both ways); iterate this safe addition under δ(G) ≥ n/2 to obtain K_n and conclude G is Hamiltonian. Both provers also record supporting lemmas (δ ≥ n/2 implies connected and 2‑connected), small technical checks on indexing/endpoints, and sharpness examples (K_{k−1,k+1} and K_{k,k+1}).

Refinements and recorded tools for the closure route to Dirac

Setting: Finite, simple, undirected graphs on n = |V(G)| ≥ 3; δ(G) is minimum degree. We index Hamiltonian paths as P = x_0,x_1,…,x_{n−1} with u = x_0 and v = x_{n−1}.

Path-closing lemma (indexing we will use): If P is Hamiltonian and deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, then G has a Hamiltonian cycle. If uv ∈ E, the path closes immediately. Otherwise define
- A = { i ∈ {1,…,n−2} : u is adjacent to x_i },
- B = { i ∈ {2,…,n−1} : v is adjacent to x_{i−1} }.
Because P spans all vertices and uv ∉ E, |A| = deg(u) and |B| = deg(v). For i ∈ {2,…,n−2}, the simultaneous occurrence i ∈ A ∩ B yields the Hamiltonian cycle u−x_i−…−v−x_{i−1}−…−u. If A ∩ B = ∅, then |A|+|B| ≤ (n−3) + 1 + 1 = n−1, contradicting deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n. Hence A ∩ B ≠ ∅ and the cycle exists.

Single-edge closure equivalence: If uv ∉ E(G) with deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, then G is Hamiltonian iff G+uv is Hamiltonian. The backward direction uses the path-closing lemma after removing uv from a Hamiltonian cycle in G+uv.

Closure under δ ≥ n/2: If δ(G) ≥ n/2, every nonedge uv satisfies deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n. Adding all such nonedges (degrees only increase) yields K_n. By the equivalence at each step, Hamiltonicity is preserved.

Immediate consequences recorded
- Connectivity: δ ≥ n/2 ⇒ G is connected.
- 2-connectivity: δ ≥ n/2 ⇒ G has no cut-vertex.
- Common neighbors under δ ≥ n/2: For nonadjacent u,v, |N(u)∪N(v)| ≤ n−2, so |N(u)∩N(v)| ≥ deg(u)+deg(v) − (n−2) ≥ 2. Thus any nonadjacent pair has at least two common neighbors. Useful for rotation–extension arguments.

Sharpness: For even n=2k, K_{k−1,k+1} has δ = k−1 = n/2−1 and is non-Hamiltonian (bipartite imbalance). For odd n=2k+1, K_{k,k+1} has δ = k = ⌊n/2⌋ and is non-Hamiltonian (all cycles even). Thus Dirac’s bound can’t be lowered.

What’s next
- Add Ore’s theorem as a corollary of the single-edge equivalence (no full closure needed).
- Prove the full Bondy–Chvátal closure theorem cl(G) is Hamiltonian iff G is.
- Optional: Pancyclicity strengthening (Bondy) under δ ≥ n/2, and a constructive extraction of a Hamiltonian cycle via closure plus the path-closing lemma.


=== output.md ===
Definitions and standing assumptions
- Graphs are finite, simple, undirected. Let n = |V(G)| ≥ 3. Write δ(G) for the minimum degree. A Hamiltonian path/cycle is a path/cycle on all n vertices.

Proposition 1 (Connectivity). If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then G is connected.
Proof. Suppose G is disconnected, and let C be a smallest component with |C| = s. Any v ∈ C has deg(v) ≤ s−1. If s ≤ n/2 then deg(v) ≤ n/2−1 < n/2, contradicting δ(G) ≥ n/2. Hence s ≥ n/2+1, but then the union of two components already has more than n vertices, a contradiction. ∎

Proposition 2 (2-connectivity). If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then G has no cut-vertex.
Proof. Suppose w is a cut-vertex. Let the components of G−w be H_1,…,H_t with t ≥ 2, and set s = min_i |V(H_i)|. For any x in a smallest component, x has neighbors only within that component and possibly w, so deg(x) ≤ (s−1)+1 = s. Since s ≤ (n−1)/2, we get deg(x) ≤ (n−1)/2 < n/2, contradicting δ(G) ≥ n/2. ∎

Lemma 3 (Path-closing). Let P = x_0,x_1,…,x_{n−1} be a Hamiltonian path in G with endpoints u = x_0 and v = x_{n−1}. If deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, then G has a Hamiltonian cycle.
Proof. If uv ∈ E(G), adding uv closes P into a Hamiltonian cycle. Assume uv ∉ E(G). Define
A = { i ∈ {1,…,n−2} : u is adjacent to x_i },
B = { i ∈ {2,…,n−1} : v is adjacent to x_{i−1} }.
Because P spans all vertices and uv ∉ E(G), every neighbor of u (resp. v) lies among x_1,…,x_{n−2}, so |A| = deg(u) and |B| = deg(v). For i ∈ {2,…,n−2}, if both u∼x_i and v∼x_{i−1} hold (i.e., i ∈ A ∩ B), then the cycle
u, x_i, x_{i+1}, …, x_{n−1}(=v), x_{i−1}, x_{i−2}, …, x_0(=u)
uses edges of P plus the two chords and spans all vertices. If A ∩ B = ∅, then among the (n−3) indices i ∈ {2,…,n−2} at most one of i ∈ A or i ∈ B can occur each time, and additionally index 1 can contribute only to A and index n−1 only to B. Hence |A|+|B| ≤ (n−3)+1+1 = n−1, contradicting deg(u)+deg(v) = |A|+|B| ≥ n. Therefore A ∩ B ≠ ∅ and the Hamiltonian cycle exists. ∎

Lemma 4 (Single-edge closure equivalence). Let uv ∉ E(G) with deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, and let G′ = G + uv. Then G is Hamiltonian if and only if G′ is Hamiltonian.
Proof. If G is Hamiltonian then so is the supergraph G′. Conversely, suppose G′ has a Hamiltonian cycle. If the cycle avoids uv, it is a Hamiltonian cycle of G. If it uses uv, then deleting uv yields a Hamiltonian path in G with endpoints u and v; apply Lemma 3 to conclude that G is Hamiltonian. ∎

Lemma 5 (Closure to K_n under δ ≥ n/2). If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then for every nonedge {u,v} we have deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n. Iteratively adding all such nonedges yields K_n.
Proof. Under δ(G) ≥ n/2, any two vertices satisfy deg(u) ≥ n/2 and deg(v) ≥ n/2, so deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n. Adding a nonedge can only increase degrees, so the degree-sum condition persists for remaining nonedges. After finitely many additions, all nonedges are added and the resulting graph is K_n. ∎

Theorem 6 (Dirac’s theorem). Let G be a graph on n ≥ 3 vertices. If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then G is Hamiltonian.
Proof. By Lemma 5 we may add all nonedges with degree-sum at least n to obtain K_n. By Lemma 4, Hamiltonicity is preserved (equivalently) at each addition, so G is Hamiltonian if and only if K_n is. Since K_n has a Hamiltonian cycle for n ≥ 3, G is Hamiltonian. ∎

Proposition 7 (Sharpness of the bound). The threshold n/2 cannot be lowered.
(a) For even n = 2k, the graph K_{k−1, k+1} has δ = k−1 = n/2−1 and is not Hamiltonian (a Hamiltonian cycle in a bipartite graph must alternate evenly, impossible with parts of different sizes).
(b) For odd n = 2k+1, the graph K_{k, k+1} has δ = k = ⌊n/2⌋ and is not Hamiltonian (all cycles in bipartite graphs are even, but n is odd).
Thus the bound n/2 is best possible up to rounding. ∎


=== round-0001/verifier.feedback.md ===
Both reports converge on the same correct and classical closure-based proof of Dirac’s theorem, and the technical core (the path-closing lemma and the single-edge closure equivalence) is handled carefully. I audited each step for boundary/index issues and unchecked assumptions:

- Connectivity and 2-connectivity lemmas: Both are correct. The key inequalities are sound: in a disconnected graph the smallest component has size s ≤ floor((n−1)/2), so a vertex in it has degree ≤ s−1 < n/2; in the cut-vertex case, a vertex in the smallest component of G−w has degree ≤ s (neighbors in its component plus possibly w) and s ≤ floor((n−1)/2) < n/2. No gaps.

- Path-closing lemma: Both versions are valid. Prover 01 uses the shifted set B′ so that |A| + |B′| = deg(u) + deg(v), and notes disjointness unless a Hamiltonian cycle already exists. Prover 02 uses A and B with indices offset by one and bounds |A|+|B| ≤ n−1 unless some index triggers the cycle. The delicate points are (i) explicitly excluding uv ∈ E at the outset (otherwise the path closes immediately), and (ii) justifying |A| = deg(u) and |B| = deg(v) by noting that, with uv ∉ E and P Hamiltonian, all neighbors of u and v lie among the interior vertices x1,…,x_{n−2}. Both reports state this; I retained the explicit indexing in the curated proof.

- Single-edge closure equivalence: Correct and uses the path-closing lemma precisely in the needed direction (removing uv from a Hamiltonian cycle in G+uv yields a Hamiltonian path in G with endpoints u,v; the degree-sum condition is in G). This is the essential equivalence for iterative closure.

- Iteration to K_n under δ ≥ n/2: Sound. Degrees only increase, so the “Ore-eligible” condition persists; adding all nonedges yields K_n, which is Hamiltonian for n ≥ 3.

- Sharpness examples: Both even and odd n examples are correct and well-justified by bipartiteness (cycles are even). These are useful to include as a “sharpness” proposition.

Minor refinement: In the path-closing lemma, it is cleanest to state “If uv ∈ E we are done; otherwise define A,B and note |A|+|B| = deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, but |A|+|B| ≤ n−1 unless the desired pair of edges occurs; hence a cycle exists.” This avoids a slight logical hiccup of appealing to disjointness as if already known.

I have curated: (i) connectivity and 2-connectivity consequences, (ii) the path-closing lemma, (iii) the single-edge closure equivalence, (iv) the closure-to-K_n step, and (v) Dirac’s theorem with proofs, plus a sharpness proposition. All are self-contained under the stated setup n ≥ 3, finite simple graphs.

Promising next steps:
- Prove Ore’s theorem as an immediate corollary of the single-edge equivalence (no need to iterate to K_n).
- Prove the full Bondy–Chvátal closure theorem (Hamiltonicity is equivalent to Hamiltonicity of the closure cl(G)). This generalizes our single-edge step and subsumes both Dirac and Ore.
- Record the common-neighbor corollary under δ ≥ n/2: any two nonadjacent vertices have at least two common neighbors (useful for rotation-extension). I noted this in the notes.
- Optional: Extend to pancyclicity (Bondy): if δ(G) ≥ n/2, then G is either pancyclic or is K_{n/2,n/2}. Also consider a constructive algorithm for finding a Hamiltonian cycle via closures and the path-closing lemma.

- Adopt closure-based proof as the primary route to Dirac: (1) prove path-closing lemma from a Hamiltonian path under deg-sum ≥ n; (2) deduce single-edge equivalence; (3) iterate to K_n under δ ≥ n/2.
- Normalize indexing to x0,…,x_{n−1} with u = x0, v = x_{n−1}. State and use A = {i∈{1,…,n−2}: u~x_i} and B = {i∈{2,…,n−1}: v~x_{i−1}} with |A| = deg(u), |B| = deg(v).
- Include short proofs of connectivity and 2-connectivity under δ ≥ n/2; include sharpness examples K_{k−1,k+1} and K_{k,k+1}; state n ≥ 3 up front.
- Optional appendix: direct Pósa/Ore-style proof; keep the ‘two common neighbors’ claim there if used.
Refinements and recorded tools for the closure route to Dirac

Setting: Finite, simple, undirected graphs on n = |V(G)| ≥ 3; δ(G) is minimum degree. We index Hamiltonian paths as P = x_0,x_1,…,x_{n−1} with u = x_0 and v = x_{n−1}.

Path-closing lemma (indexing we will use): If P is Hamiltonian and deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, then G has a Hamiltonian cycle. If uv ∈ E, the path closes immediately. Otherwise define
- A = { i ∈ {1,…,n−2} : u is adjacent to x_i },
- B = { i ∈ {2,…,n−1} : v is adjacent to x_{i−1} }.
Because P spans all vertices and uv ∉ E, |A| = deg(u) and |B| = deg(v). For i ∈ {2,…,n−2}, the simultaneous occurrence i ∈ A ∩ B yields the Hamiltonian cycle u−x_i−…−v−x_{i−1}−…−u. If A ∩ B = ∅, then |A|+|B| ≤ (n−3) + 1 + 1 = n−1, contradicting deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n. Hence A ∩ B ≠ ∅ and the cycle exists.

Single-edge closure equivalence: If uv ∉ E(G) with deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, then G is Hamiltonian iff G+uv is Hamiltonian. The backward direction uses the path-closing lemma after removing uv from a Hamiltonian cycle in G+uv.

Closure under δ ≥ n/2: If δ(G) ≥ n/2, every nonedge uv satisfies deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n. Adding all such nonedges (degrees only increase) yields K_n. By the equivalence at each step, Hamiltonicity is preserved.

Immediate consequences recorded
- Connectivity: δ ≥ n/2 ⇒ G is connected.
- 2-connectivity: δ ≥ n/2 ⇒ G has no cut-vertex.
- Common neighbors under δ ≥ n/2: For nonadjacent u,v, |N(u)∪N(v)| ≤ n−2, so |N(u)∩N(v)| ≥ deg(u)+deg(v) − (n−2) ≥ 2. Thus any nonadjacent pair has at least two common neighbors. Useful for rotation–extension arguments.

Sharpness: For even n=2k, K_{k−1,k+1} has δ = k−1 = n/2−1 and is non-Hamiltonian (bipartite imbalance). For odd n=2k+1, K_{k,k+1} has δ = k = ⌊n/2⌋ and is non-Hamiltonian (all cycles even). Thus Dirac’s bound can’t be lowered.

What’s next
- Add Ore’s theorem as a corollary of the single-edge equivalence (no full closure needed).
- Prove the full Bondy–Chvátal closure theorem cl(G) is Hamiltonian iff G is.
- Optional: Pancyclicity strengthening (Bondy) under δ ≥ n/2, and a constructive extraction of a Hamiltonian cycle via closure plus the path-closing lemma.

Definitions and standing assumptions
- Graphs are finite, simple, undirected. Let n = |V(G)| ≥ 3. Write δ(G) for the minimum degree. A Hamiltonian path/cycle is a path/cycle on all n vertices.

Proposition 1 (Connectivity). If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then G is connected.
Proof. Suppose G is disconnected, and let C be a smallest component with |C| = s. Any v ∈ C has deg(v) ≤ s−1. If s ≤ n/2 then deg(v) ≤ n/2−1 < n/2, contradicting δ(G) ≥ n/2. Hence s ≥ n/2+1, but then the union of two components already has more than n vertices, a contradiction. ∎

Proposition 2 (2-connectivity). If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then G has no cut-vertex.
Proof. Suppose w is a cut-vertex. Let the components of G−w be H_1,…,H_t with t ≥ 2, and set s = min_i |V(H_i)|. For any x in a smallest component, x has neighbors only within that component and possibly w, so deg(x) ≤ (s−1)+1 = s. Since s ≤ (n−1)/2, we get deg(x) ≤ (n−1)/2 < n/2, contradicting δ(G) ≥ n/2. ∎

Lemma 3 (Path-closing). Let P = x_0,x_1,…,x_{n−1} be a Hamiltonian path in G with endpoints u = x_0 and v = x_{n−1}. If deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, then G has a Hamiltonian cycle.
Proof. If uv ∈ E(G), adding uv closes P into a Hamiltonian cycle. Assume uv ∉ E(G). Define
A = { i ∈ {1,…,n−2} : u is adjacent to x_i },
B = { i ∈ {2,…,n−1} : v is adjacent to x_{i−1} }.
Because P spans all vertices and uv ∉ E(G), every neighbor of u (resp. v) lies among x_1,…,x_{n−2}, so |A| = deg(u) and |B| = deg(v). For i ∈ {2,…,n−2}, if both u∼x_i and v∼x_{i−1} hold (i.e., i ∈ A ∩ B), then the cycle
u, x_i, x_{i+1}, …, x_{n−1}(=v), x_{i−1}, x_{i−2}, …, x_0(=u)
uses edges of P plus the two chords and spans all vertices. If A ∩ B = ∅, then among the (n−3) indices i ∈ {2,…,n−2} at most one of i ∈ A or i ∈ B can occur each time, and additionally index 1 can contribute only to A and index n−1 only to B. Hence |A|+|B| ≤ (n−3)+1+1 = n−1, contradicting deg(u)+deg(v) = |A|+|B| ≥ n. Therefore A ∩ B ≠ ∅ and the Hamiltonian cycle exists. ∎

Lemma 4 (Single-edge closure equivalence). Let uv ∉ E(G) with deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, and let G′ = G + uv. Then G is Hamiltonian if and only if G′ is Hamiltonian.
Proof. If G is Hamiltonian then so is the supergraph G′. Conversely, suppose G′ has a Hamiltonian cycle. If the cycle avoids uv, it is a Hamiltonian cycle of G. If it uses uv, then deleting uv yields a Hamiltonian path in G with endpoints u and v; apply Lemma 3 to conclude that G is Hamiltonian. ∎

Lemma 5 (Closure to K_n under δ ≥ n/2). If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then for every nonedge {u,v} we have deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n. Iteratively adding all such nonedges yields K_n.
Proof. Under δ(G) ≥ n/2, any two vertices satisfy deg(u) ≥ n/2 and deg(v) ≥ n/2, so deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n. Adding a nonedge can only increase degrees, so the degree-sum condition persists for remaining nonedges. After finitely many additions, all nonedges are added and the resulting graph is K_n. ∎

Theorem 6 (Dirac’s theorem). Let G be a graph on n ≥ 3 vertices. If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then G is Hamiltonian.
Proof. By Lemma 5 we may add all nonedges with degree-sum at least n to obtain K_n. By Lemma 4, Hamiltonicity is preserved (equivalently) at each addition, so G is Hamiltonian if and only if K_n is. Since K_n has a Hamiltonian cycle for n ≥ 3, G is Hamiltonian. ∎

Proposition 7 (Sharpness of the bound). The threshold n/2 cannot be lowered.
(a) For even n = 2k, the graph K_{k−1, k+1} has δ = k−1 = n/2−1 and is not Hamiltonian (a Hamiltonian cycle in a bipartite graph must alternate evenly, impossible with parts of different sizes).
(b) For odd n = 2k+1, the graph K_{k, k+1} has δ = k = ⌊n/2⌋ and is not Hamiltonian (all cycles in bipartite graphs are even, but n is odd).
Thus the bound n/2 is best possible up to rounding. ∎
