All key steps (path‑closing lemma, single‑edge closure equivalence, iterative augmentation to K_n) are present with correct indexing and boundary handling (n ≥ 3).\\n- Connectivity (Prop. 1) and 2‑connectivity (Prop. 2) are sound; the inequalities used are tight and standard.\\n- Path‑closing lemma (Lemma 3): The counting argument is valid. Minor clarity note (not a gap): it helps to explicitly remark that all neighbors of u (resp. v) lie among x_1,…,x_{n−2} because the path is Hamiltonian and uv ∉ E(G); this justifies |A| = deg(u), |B| = deg(v). The proof already indicates this.\\n- Single‑edge closure equivalence (Lemma 4) is correctly applied with degree sums taken in G (not in G+uv), which is essential.\\n- Iteration to K_n (Lemma 5) correctly notes that degrees only increase, so every remaining nonedge remains “eligible,” ensuring the equivalence step can be applied throughout.\\n- Sharpness examples are correct and well‑justified by bipartiteness.\\n\\nNew, small results to consider curating (each with “why useful”) \\n1) Ore’s Theorem as an immediate corollary of Lemma 4\\n- Statement: If for every nonadjacent u,v in G we have deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, then G is Hamiltonian.\\n- Proof sketch: Iteratively add each nonedge uv (all are eligible by hypothesis). By Lemma 4, Hamiltonicity is preserved at each step, so G is Hamiltonian iff the final graph (K_n) is; hence G is Hamiltonian. ∎\\n- Why useful: It isolates the closure‑equivalence as the core engine and shows Dirac follows immediately from Ore (since δ ≥ n/2 implies Ore’s condition).\\n\\n2) At least two common neighbors for nonadjacent vertices under δ ≥ n/2\\n- Statement: If δ(G) ≥ n/2 and u,v are nonadjacent, then |N(u) ∩ N(v)| ≥ 2.\\n- Proof: |N(u) ∪ N(v)| ≤ n − 2, so |N(u) ∩ N(v)| = deg(u)+deg(v) − |N(u) ∪ N(v)| ≥ n − (n − 2) = 2. ∎\\n- Why useful: Strengthens structural understanding; helpful for rotation‑extension arguments and implies the next corollary.\\n\\n3) Diameter bound under δ ≥ n/2\\n- Statement: If δ(G) ≥ n/2 then diam(G) ≤ 2.\\n- Proof: Any nonadjacent pair shares at least one common neighbor (indeed ≥ 2 by the previous lemma), so every pair is at distance ≤ 2. ∎\\n- Why useful: Sanity check and auxiliary tool; often used in alternative Hamiltonicity proofs.\\n\\nSanity‑check example at the threshold\\n- Example: For even n, K_{n/2,n/2} satisfies δ = n/2 and is Hamiltonian (alternate between parts to get an n‑cycle). Under the closure process, all nonedges lie within parts and are added (degree‑sum = n), producing K_n as expected. Why useful: Confirms correctness exactly at the boundary.\\n\\nOptional strengthening to record (standard, aligns with Lemma 4)\\n4) Bondy–Chvátal closure theorem (statement and short justification)\\n- Statement: Let cl(G) be obtained by repeatedly adding nonedges uv with deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n until no such pair remains. Then G is Hamiltonian iff cl(G) is Hamiltonian.\\n- Justification sketch: Each single addition preserves Hamiltonicity equivalence by Lemma 4; hence any maximal sequence yields a final graph H with G Hamiltonian iff H is. The closure is unique (order‑independent) by the monotonicity of the rule (adding eligible edges cannot invalidate eligibility of others). Thus H = cl(G). ∎\\n- Why useful: Conceptual unification; Dirac and Ore are immediate corollaries.\\n\\nExamples and self‑checks\\n- Small n: For n = 3, δ ≥ 2 implies G = K_3, Hamiltonian. For n = 4, δ ≥ 2 includes C_4 and K_4−e; both are Hamiltonian, consistent with the theorem.\\n\\nObstacles and delicate points (none blocking)\\n- In Lemma 3, the inequality |A|+|B| ≤ (n−3)+1+1 counts the interior indices {2,…,n−2} with disjointness unless we already have the desired cycle, plus the endpoint‑adjacent indices i = 1 (for A only) and i = n − 1 (for B only). This is correct but easy to miscount; retaining this explicit partition in outputs.md avoids confusion.\\n\\nNext steps (for outputs.md)\\n- Add as Corollaries: (i) Ore’s theorem, (ii) common‑neighbor and diameter ≤ 2 lemmas. These are short and self‑contained.\\n- Optionally add the Bondy–Chvátal closure theorem statement with a brief justification referencing Lemma 4.\\n- If desired, include a short remark on constructing a Hamiltonian cycle: traverse the closure additions; if the final Hamiltonian cycle uses a newly added edge uv, remove it to get a Hamiltonian path in the previous graph and apply the path‑closing lemma; iterate backward to G.\\n\"}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"auto","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"ProverOutput","schema_":{"properties":{"progress_md":{"description":"Append-only progress notes","title":"Progress Md","type":"string"}},"required":["progress_md"],"title":"ProverOutput","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":10649,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":7404,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":6144},"total_tokens":18053},"user":null,"store":true}
