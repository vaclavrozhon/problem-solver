A Hamiltonian graph is one that contains a Hamiltonian cycle, which is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once (except for the starting vertex, which is visited twice).\\n\\n**Mini-plan:**\\n- Review known results about Hamiltonian graphs and minimum degree conditions.\\n- Consider Dirac's Theorem as a potential starting point.\\n- Attempt to construct counterexamples for graphs with minimum degree \\u2265 n/2 that are not Hamiltonian.\\n\\n**Dirac's Theorem** states that if a graph \\(G\\) has \\(n \\u2265 3\\) vertices and the minimum degree of any vertex is at least \\(n/2\\), then \\(G\\) is Hamiltonian. This theorem directly addresses the task, suggesting that every graph with minimum degree \\u2265 n/2 is indeed Hamiltonian, provided \\(n \\u2265 3\\).\\n\\n**How it can fail:** Dirac's Theorem might not apply to specific graph constructions that evade the conditions set by the theorem, or there might be nuances in the definition of minimum degree or Hamiltonian cycles that are overlooked.\\n\\n**Toy counterexample:** Consider a graph with \\(n = 4\\) vertices where each vertex is connected to exactly two others. This graph meets the minimum degree condition (\\u2265 n/2 = 2) but does not contain a Hamiltonian cycle because it forms a square, and thus, each vertex is visited once without returning to the start. However, this counterexample fails to invalidate Dirac's Theorem because the graph is indeed Hamiltonian; it has a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex.\\n\\nGiven Dirac's Theorem, it appears that the statement is true under the conditions provided. However, further exploration is needed to ensure no edge cases or specific graph configurations have been overlooked.\",\n  \"new_files\": [],\n  \"requests_for_more_materials\": [],\n  \"next_actions_for_prover\": []\n}",
