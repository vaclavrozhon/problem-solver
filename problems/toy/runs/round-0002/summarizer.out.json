  "summary_md": "The round audits and micro\u2011refinements confirm the Dirac proof via Bondy\u2013Chv\u00e1tal closure is correct and complete for n\u22653. Key lemmas (path\u2011closing, single\u2011edge closure equivalence) and the iterative augmentation to K_n are logically sound; degrees increase monotonically so eligibility persists. Minor clarity edits were suggested (make the \u201ctwo components\u201d sentence explicit in Prop.1, state deg\u2011sums are measured in G in Lemma 4, and keep the indexing in Lemma 3 explicit). Several short, useful corollaries were recommended for outputs.md: Ore\u2019s theorem, the Bondy\u2013Chv\u00e1tal closure equivalence, the \u22652 common\u2011neighbors fact and diam(G) \u2264 2 under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2, and a constructive algorithm to extract a Hamiltonian cycle by reversing the closure. Sanity\u2011check examples (K_{n/2,n/2}, small n) validate sharpness. Verifier: success. Citations: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json, verifier output.",

    "Minor wording fixes: explicitly state \u201ctwo components\u201d in Prop.1, clarify that degree sums in Lemma 4 are taken in G (not G+uv), and make the index partition in Lemma 3 explicit.",
    "New corollaries recommended: Ore\u2019s theorem (as immediate consequence), Bondy\u2013Chv\u00e1tal closure theorem (closure equivalence), \u22652 common neighbors for any nonadjacent pair when \u03b4\u2265n/2, and diam(G) \u2264 2.",
    "Constructive extraction algorithm: reverse the added edges from K_n, removing an added edge gives a Hamiltonian path whose endpoints can be reclosed by Lemma 3 to produce a cycle in the previous graph; iterate to G.",
