## Audit of output.md (correctness and small refinements)
- The curated proof establishes Dirac’s theorem via the Bondy–Chvátal single‑edge step and is logically sound. The path‑closing lemma’s indexing and the equivalence step (Lemma 4) are correct and sufficient for the iterative closure to K_n under δ ≥ n/2.
- Proposition 1 (connectivity): The final sentence can be made explicit: if the smallest component has size s ≥ n/2+1 and there are ≥2 components, then two components together have at least 2s ≥ n+2 vertices, impossible. The argument as written is correct but could state “two components” more explicitly.
- Proposition 2 (2‑connectivity): The bound s ≤ ⌊(n−1)/2⌋ follows since the sum of component sizes of G−w is n−1 with at least two components. The current proof is fine.
- Lemma 3 (path‑closing): The counting inequality |A|+|B| ≤ n−1 under A∩B=∅ is accurate; the justification |A|=deg(u), |B|=deg(v) is correct because uv ∉ E and P is Hamiltonian. No gaps detected.

## New, small results to add (useful corollaries and generalizations)
1) Common neighbors and diameter under δ ≥ n/2
- Corollary (≥2 common neighbors): If δ(G) ≥ n/2 and u,v are nonadjacent, then |N(u)∩N(v)| ≥ 2.
  Proof: N(u), N(v) ⊆ V\{u,v}, so |N(u)∪N(v)| ≤ n−2. Hence |N(u)∩N(v)| = deg(u)+deg(v)−|N(u)∪N(v)| ≥ n−(n−2) = 2.
- Corollary (diameter ≤ 2): Under δ(G) ≥ n/2, any two vertices are adjacent or have a common neighbor, hence diam(G) ≤ 2. (This follows from the previous inequality with “≥1” as well.)

2) Ore’s theorem (record as a stand‑alone consequence of Lemma 4)
- Theorem (Ore): If for every nonadjacent u,v we have deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, then G is Hamiltonian.
  Proof: Enumerate all nonedges and add them one‑by‑one. At each step, Lemma 4 applies (the degree‑sum condition is measured in the current graph) and preserves Hamiltonicity equivalence. The final graph is K_n, which is Hamiltonian, so the original G is Hamiltonian.
  Why useful here: Dirac is an immediate corollary of Ore since δ ≥ n/2 implies every nonedge satisfies the Ore condition.

3) Full closure equivalence (Bondy–Chvátal) — compact statement and proof
- Theorem (Closure equivalence): Let cl(G) be obtained by iteratively adding nonedges uv with deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n until none remain. Then G is Hamiltonian iff cl(G) is Hamiltonian.
  Proof: Let G = G_0 ⊆ G_1 ⊆ … ⊆ G_m = cl(G), where each G_{i+1} = G_i + u_iv_i with deg_{G_i}(u_i)+deg_{G_i}(v_i) ≥ n. By Lemma 4 applied in G_i, G_i is Hamiltonian iff G_{i+1} is. Induct over i to conclude G is Hamiltonian iff cl(G) is.
  Why useful: This generalizes the Dirac and Ore arguments and matches the standard literature.

4) Constructive extraction of a Hamiltonian cycle (algorithmic note)
- Under δ ≥ n/2, closure reaches K_n. Fix any Hamiltonian cycle C_m in K_n (e.g., (1,2,…,n,1)). Traverse the added edges in reverse (from K_n back to G). If the current cycle uses the last added edge uv, delete uv to obtain a Hamiltonian path with endpoints u,v and apply the path‑closing lemma (in the previous graph) to replace it by a Hamiltonian cycle avoiding uv. If it doesn’t use uv, keep the cycle. This yields a Hamiltonian cycle in the original G. Each step is justified by Lemma 3.

## Examples/sanity checks (beyond those in output.md)
- Even n: K_{n/2,n/2} has δ = n/2 and is Hamiltonian; closure adds all intra‑part edges (each pair has degree‑sum n), ending at K_n, consistent with equivalence.
- Small n: For n=3, δ ≥ 2 gives K_3. For n=4, δ ≥ 2 covers C_4 and K_{2,2}, both Hamiltonian.

## Next steps for outputs.md
- Optionally append: (i) the “≥2 common neighbors” and “diameter ≤ 2” corollaries; (ii) Ore’s theorem with the short proof above; (iii) the Bondy–Chvátal closure equivalence statement (compact proof via Lemma 4). These are short and strengthen the exposition without altering the main Dirac proof.

## Round 0002 — audit, micro‑refinements, and useful corollaries

Status and audit of output.md
- The curated proof is complete and correct for Dirac’s theorem via the closure route. All key steps (path‑closing lemma, single‑edge closure equivalence, iterative augmentation to K_n) are present with correct indexing and boundary handling (n ≥ 3).
- Connectivity (Prop. 1) and 2‑connectivity (Prop. 2) are sound; the inequalities used are tight and standard.
- Path‑closing lemma (Lemma 3): The counting argument is valid. Minor clarity note (not a gap): it helps to explicitly remark that all neighbors of u (resp. v) lie among x_1,…,x_{n−2} because the path is Hamiltonian and uv ∉ E(G); this justifies |A| = deg(u), |B| = deg(v). The proof already indicates this.
- Single‑edge closure equivalence (Lemma 4) is correctly applied with degree sums taken in G (not in G+uv), which is essential.
- Iteration to K_n (Lemma 5) correctly notes that degrees only increase, so every remaining nonedge remains “eligible,” ensuring the equivalence step can be applied throughout.
- Sharpness examples are correct and well‑justified by bipartiteness.

New, small results to consider curating (each with “why useful”) 
1) Ore’s Theorem as an immediate corollary of Lemma 4
- Statement: If for every nonadjacent u,v in G we have deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, then G is Hamiltonian.
- Proof sketch: Iteratively add each nonedge uv (all are eligible by hypothesis). By Lemma 4, Hamiltonicity is preserved at each step, so G is Hamiltonian iff the final graph (K_n) is; hence G is Hamiltonian. ∎
- Why useful: It isolates the closure‑equivalence as the core engine and shows Dirac follows immediately from Ore (since δ ≥ n/2 implies Ore’s condition).

2) At least two common neighbors for nonadjacent vertices under δ ≥ n/2
- Statement: If δ(G) ≥ n/2 and u,v are nonadjacent, then |N(u) ∩ N(v)| ≥ 2.
- Proof: |N(u) ∪ N(v)| ≤ n − 2, so |N(u) ∩ N(v)| = deg(u)+deg(v) − |N(u) ∪ N(v)| ≥ n − (n − 2) = 2. ∎
- Why useful: Strengthens structural understanding; helpful for rotation‑extension arguments and implies the next corollary.

3) Diameter bound under δ ≥ n/2
- Statement: If δ(G) ≥ n/2 then diam(G) ≤ 2.
- Proof: Any nonadjacent pair shares at least one common neighbor (indeed ≥ 2 by the previous lemma), so every pair is at distance ≤ 2. ∎
- Why useful: Sanity check and auxiliary tool; often used in alternative Hamiltonicity proofs.

Sanity‑check example at the threshold
- Example: For even n, K_{n/2,n/2} satisfies δ = n/2 and is Hamiltonian (alternate between parts to get an n‑cycle). Under the closure process, all nonedges lie within parts and are added (degree‑sum = n), producing K_n as expected. Why useful: Confirms correctness exactly at the boundary.

Optional strengthening to record (standard, aligns with Lemma 4)
4) Bondy–Chvátal closure theorem (statement and short justification)
- Statement: Let cl(G) be obtained by repeatedly adding nonedges uv with deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n until no such pair remains. Then G is Hamiltonian iff cl(G) is Hamiltonian.
- Justification sketch: Each single addition preserves Hamiltonicity equivalence by Lemma 4; hence any maximal sequence yields a final graph H with G Hamiltonian iff H is. The closure is unique (order‑independent) by the monotonicity of the rule (adding eligible edges cannot invalidate eligibility of others). Thus H = cl(G). ∎
- Why useful: Conceptual unification; Dirac and Ore are immediate corollaries.

Examples and self‑checks
- Small n: For n = 3, δ ≥ 2 implies G = K_3, Hamiltonian. For n = 4, δ ≥ 2 includes C_4 and K_4−e; both are Hamiltonian, consistent with the theorem.

Obstacles and delicate points (none blocking)
- In Lemma 3, the inequality |A|+|B| ≤ (n−3)+1+1 counts the interior indices {2,…,n−2} with disjointness unless we already have the desired cycle, plus the endpoint‑adjacent indices i = 1 (for A only) and i = n − 1 (for B only). This is correct but easy to miscount; retaining this explicit partition in outputs.md avoids confusion.

Next steps (for outputs.md)
- Add as Corollaries: (i) Ore’s theorem, (ii) common‑neighbor and diameter ≤ 2 lemmas. These are short and self‑contained.
- Optionally add the Bondy–Chvátal closure theorem statement with a brief justification referencing Lemma 4.
- If desired, include a short remark on constructing a Hamiltonian cycle: traverse the closure additions; if the final Hamiltonian cycle uses a newly added edge uv, remove it to get a Hamiltonian path in the previous graph and apply the path‑closing lemma; iterate backward to G.
