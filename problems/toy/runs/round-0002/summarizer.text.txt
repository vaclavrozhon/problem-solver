{"summary_md":"The round audits and micro‑refinements confirm the Dirac proof via Bondy–Chvátal closure is correct and complete for n≥3. Key lemmas (path‑closing, single‑edge closure equivalence) and the iterative augmentation to K_n are logically sound; degrees increase monotonically so eligibility persists. Minor clarity edits were suggested (make the “two components” sentence explicit in Prop.1, state deg‑sums are measured in G in Lemma 4, and keep the indexing in Lemma 3 explicit). Several short, useful corollaries were recommended for outputs.md: Ore’s theorem, the Bondy–Chvátal closure equivalence, the ≥2 common‑neighbors fact and diam(G) ≤ 2 under δ ≥ n/2, and a constructive algorithm to extract a Hamiltonian cycle by reversing the closure. Sanity‑check examples (K_{n/2,n/2}, small n) validate sharpness. Verifier: success.
