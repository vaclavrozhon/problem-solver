The prover's work correctly identifies Dirac's Theorem as a central argument for proving that every graph with a minimum degree ≥ n/2 is Hamiltonian, provided n ≥ 3. The attempt to construct a counterexample (a square graph with n = 4 and minimum degree = 2) and the subsequent realization that this graph is indeed Hamiltonian, further supports the correctness of the initial claim under the conditions given by Dirac's Theorem.

However, the prover's exploration lacks depth in a few areas:

1. **Edge Cases and Exceptions:** The prover mentions the need for further exploration of edge cases or specific graph configurations but does not provide any follow-up on this point. It's crucial to investigate whether there are any graph constructions that could potentially violate the conditions of Dirac's Theorem or if there are any exceptions to the theorem itself.

2. **Rigor in Argumentation:** While the prover's reliance on Dirac's Theorem is justified, a more rigorous mathematical proof or a broader range of examples and counterexamples would strengthen the argument. Specifically, exploring graphs with a larger number of vertices and different configurations could provide a more comprehensive validation of the claim.

3. **Theoretical Underpinnings:** The prover could enhance the argument by delving deeper into the theoretical basis of Dirac's Theorem, including its proof and any assumptions or limitations inherent in the theorem. This would provide a stronger foundation for the claim.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Conduct a thorough review of literature and existing proofs related to Dirac's Theorem to identify any potential limitations or conditions that might affect its applicability.
- Explore a wider range of graph configurations, especially those with a higher number of vertices, to test the claim under various conditions.
- Provide a detailed examination of the proof of Dirac's Theorem to understand its foundational assumptions and any potential exceptions.
