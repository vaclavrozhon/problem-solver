The end of Prop. 1 could be made slightly more explicit (why \u201ctwo components\u201d force > n vertices), but it is logically fine: if the smallest component has size s \u2265 n/2 + 1 and there are \u2265 2 components, then two components contribute at least 2s \u2265 n + 2 vertices, impossible.\n- Lemma 3 (path-closing) is sound. The disjointness accounting over indices {2,\u2026,n\u22122} and the treatment of endpoints i = 1 and i = n \u2212 1 correctly yield |A| + |B| \u2264 n \u2212 1 under A \u2229 B = \u2205, contradicting deg(u) + deg(v) \u2265 n. The definitions of A and B explicitly avoid counting uv and ensure |A| = deg(u), |B| = deg(v).\n- Lemma 4 (single-edge closure equivalence) is used with degree sums measured in the current graph at each step of augmentation; the statement already uses degrees in G for one step, which is exactly what is needed for iterative application.\n- Lemma 5 and Theorem 6 (Dirac) are standard and correct.

Iterating \u03a6 from G stabilizes at cl(G). Monotonicity of \u03a6 gives order-independence (any maximal one-by-one process yields the same cl(G)) and provides a chain from G to cl(G) adding one eligible edge at a time; applying Lemma 4 at each step gives G Hamiltonian iff cl(G) Hamiltonian.\n\nAlgorithmic note (constructing a Hamiltonian cycle under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2)\n- Compute the closure (here it is K_n) while recording the added edges in order.\n- Start with any Hamiltonian cycle in K_n.\n- Traverse the added edges in reverse: if the current cycle uses the last added edge uv, delete uv to get a Hamiltonian u\u2013v path in the previous graph and re-close it by the path-closing lemma; otherwise keep the cycle.

If u and v are nonadjacent, then |N(u) \u2229 N(v)| \u2265 2.\nProof. Since N(u), N(v) \u2286 V(G) \\ {u, v}, we have |N(u) \u222a N(v)| \u2264 n \u2212 2. Hence\n|N(u) \u2229 N(v)| = deg(u) + deg(v) \u2212 |N(u) \u222a N(v)| \u2265 n \u2212 (n \u2212 2) = 2. \u220e\n\nCorollary 9 (Diameter \u2264 2 under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2). If \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2, then diam(G) \u2264 2.\nProof. For any two vertices u, v, either uv \u2208 E(G), giving distance 1, or uv \u2209 E(G), in which case by Corollary 8 they share a neighbor and have distance 2. \u220e\n\nTheorem 10 (Ore\u2019s theorem). Let G be a graph on n \u2265 3 vertices such that for every nonadjacent pair u, v we have deg(u) + deg(v) \u2265 n. Then G is Hamiltonian.\nProof. Enumerate the nonedges of G arbitrarily and add them one by one. Degrees only increase, so at each step the current nonedge uv being added satisfies deg(u) + deg(v) \u2265 n in the current graph. By Lemma 4, each single addition preserves Hamiltonicity equivalence. The final graph is K_n, which is Hamiltonian; thus the original G is Hamiltonian. \u220e\n\nTheorem 11 (Bondy\u2013Chv\u00e1tal closure equivalence). Let G be a graph on n \u2265 3 vertices. Define the operator \u03a6 by\n\u03a6(H) = H + { uv \u2209 E(H) : deg_H(u) + deg_H(v) \u2265 n }.\nLet cl(G) = \u03a6^m(G) for any m large enough that \u03a6^m(G) = \u03a6^{m+1}(G) (this stabilization occurs since the edge set is finite). Then G is Hamiltonian if and only if cl(G) is Hamiltonian. Moreover, cl(G) is the unique graph obtainable from G by repeatedly adding nonedges uv with deg(current u) + deg(current v) \u2265 n until none remain, independent of the order of additions.\nProof. Uniqueness/order-independence: Consider the chain H_0 = G, H_{t+1} = \u03a6(H_t). Since |E| is finite, H_t stabilizes at some m with H_m = \u03a6(H_m); set cl(G) = H_m. Let G = G_0 \u2282 G_1 \u2282 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u2282 G_s = H be any maximal chain obtained by adding one eligible nonedge at each step, stopping when no such pair remains. First, by monotonicity of \u03a6 we have G_i \u2286 \u03a6^i(G) for all i (induction: if G_i \u2286 \u03a6^i(G), then G_{i+1} \u2286 \u03a6(G_i) \u2286 \u03a6(\u03a6^i(G)) = \u03a6^{i+1}(G)). Hence H \u2286 \u03a6^s(G) \u2286 cl(G). Conversely, since H has no eligible nonedges, \u03a6(H) = H; thus for all k, \u03a6^k(G) \u2286 \u03a6^k(H) = H by monotonicity, and in particular cl(G) \u2286 H. Therefore H = cl(G), proving order-independence and uniqueness.\nEquivalence of Hamiltonicity: At each stage, the set \u03a6(H_t) \\ E(H_t) consists of nonedges uv whose degree sums are \u2265 n in H_t. Enumerating these edges one by one yields a chain of single-edge additions from H_t to H_{t+1}; concatenating over t = 0, 1, \u2026, m \u2212 1 gives a chain from G to cl(G) where each added edge satisfies the degree-sum condition in the current graph. By Lemma 4, each addition preserves Hamiltonicity equivalence; composing these equivalences yields that G is Hamiltonian iff cl(G) is. \u220e",
