--- SYSTEM ---
You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md and outputs.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers
- notes.md (summary so far)
- outputs.md (rigorously proven results so far)

Guidelines:
- notes.md: should be a readable running log of interesting work. Prefer appending. Replace only if old notes are clearly misleading.
- outputs.md: should be concise and rigorous. Keep only proven theorems with clear proofs. If a statement is flawed and you cannot fix it, remove it from outputs.md and instead add it to notes.md with explanation.
- Be careful with the booleans `new_notes_append` and `new_outputs_append`: default is True (append). Use False only when deliberately rewriting everything.

Tasks:
1) Audit rigor: identify unjustified steps, false statements, missing lemmas; produce minimal counterexamples.
2) Triage value: separate genuine progress from noise.
3) Guide next steps: propose what provers should try next.

The path\u2011closing lemma\u2019s indexing and the equivalence step (Lemma 4) are correct and sufficient for the iterative closure to K_n under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2.\n- Proposition 1 (connectivity): The final sentence can be made explicit: if the smallest component has size s \u2265 n/2+1 and there are \u22652 components, then two components together have at least 2s \u2265 n+2 vertices, impossible. The argument as written is correct but could state \u201ctwo components\u201d more explicitly.\n- Proposition 2 (2\u2011connectivity): The bound s \u2264 \u230a(n\u22121)/2\u230b follows since the sum of component sizes of G\u2212w is n\u22121 with at least two components. The current proof is fine.\n- Lemma 3 (path\u2011closing): The counting inequality |A|+|B| \u2264 n\u22121 under A\u2229B=\u2205 is accurate; the justification |A|=deg(u), |B|=deg(v) is correct because uv \u2209 E and P is Hamiltonian. No gaps detected.\n\n## New, small results to add (useful corollaries and generalizations)\n1) Common neighbors and diameter under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2\n- Corollary (\u22652 common neighbors): If \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2 and u,v are nonadjacent, then |N(u)\u2229N(v)| \u2265 2.\n  Proof: N(u), N(v) \u2286 V\\{u,v}, so |N(u)\u222aN(v)| \u2264 n\u22122. Hence |N(u)\u2229N(v)| = deg(u)+deg(v)\u2212|N(u)\u222aN(v)| \u2265 n\u2212(n\u22122) = 2.\n- Corollary (diameter \u2264 2): Under \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2, any two vertices are adjacent or have a common neighbor, hence diam(G) \u2264 2. (This follows from the previous inequality with \u201c\u22651\u201d as well.)\n\n2) Ore\u2019s theorem (record as a stand\u2011alone consequence of Lemma 4)\n- Theorem (Ore): If for every nonadjacent u,v we have deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n, then G is Hamiltonian.\n  Proof: Enumerate all nonedges and add them one\u2011by\u2011one. At each step, Lemma 4 applies (the degree\u2011sum condition is measured in the current graph) and preserves Hamiltonicity equivalence. The final graph is K_n, which is Hamiltonian, so the original G is Hamiltonian.\n  Why useful here: Dirac is an immediate corollary of Ore since \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 implies every nonedge satisfies the Ore condition.\n\n3) Full closure equivalence (Bondy\u2013Chv\u00e1tal) \u2014 compact statement and proof\n- Theorem (Closure equivalence): Let cl(G) be obtained by iteratively adding nonedges uv with deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n until none remain. Then G is Hamiltonian iff cl(G) is Hamiltonian.\n  Proof: Let G = G_0 \u2286 G_1 \u2286 \u2026 \u2286 G_m = cl(G), where each G_{i+1} = G_i + u_iv_i with deg_{G_i}(u_i)+deg_{G_i}(v_i) \u2265 n. By Lemma 4 applied in G_i, G_i is Hamiltonian iff G_{i+1} is. Induct over i to conclude G is Hamiltonian iff cl(G) is.\n  Why useful: This generalizes the Dirac and Ore arguments and matches the standard literature.\n\n4) Constructive extraction of a Hamiltonian cycle (algorithmic note)\n- Under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2, closure reaches K_n. Fix any Hamiltonian cycle C_m in K_n (e.g., (1,2,\u2026,n,1)). Traverse the added edges in reverse (from K_n back to G). If the current cycle uses the last added edge uv, delete uv to obtain a Hamiltonian path with endpoints u,v and apply the path\u2011closing lemma (in the previous graph) to replace it by a Hamiltonian cycle avoiding uv. If it doesn\u2019t use uv, keep the cycle. This yields a Hamiltonian cycle in the original G. Each step is justified by Lemma 3.\n\n## Examples/sanity checks (beyond those in output.md)\n- Even n: K_{n/2,n/2} has \u03b4 = n/2 and is Hamiltonian; closure adds all intra\u2011part edges (each pair has degree\u2011sum n), ending at K_n, consistent with equivalence.\n- Small n: For n=3, \u03b4 \u2265 2 gives K_3. For n=4, \u03b4 \u2265 2 covers C_4 and K_{2,2}, both Hamiltonian.\n\n## Next steps for outputs.md\n- Optionally append: (i) the \u201c\u22652 common neighbors\u201d and \u201cdiameter \u2264 2\u201d corollaries; (ii) Ore\u2019s theorem with the short proof above; (iii) the Bondy\u2013Chv\u00e1tal closure equivalence statement (compact proof via Lemma 4).

All key steps (path\u2011closing lemma, single\u2011edge closure equivalence, iterative augmentation to K_n) are present with correct indexing and boundary handling (n \u2265 3).\n- Connectivity (Prop. 1) and 2\u2011connectivity (Prop. 2) are sound; the inequalities used are tight and standard.\n- Path\u2011closing lemma (Lemma 3): The counting argument is valid. Minor clarity note (not a gap): it helps to explicitly remark that all neighbors of u (resp. v) lie among x_1,\u2026,x_{n\u22122} because the path is Hamiltonian and uv \u2209 E(G); this justifies |A| = deg(u), |B| = deg(v).

By Lemma 4, Hamiltonicity is preserved at each step, so G is Hamiltonian iff the final graph (K_n) is; hence G is Hamiltonian. \u220e\n- Why useful: It isolates the closure\u2011equivalence as the core engine and shows Dirac follows immediately from Ore (since \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 implies Ore\u2019s condition).\n\n2) At least two common neighbors for nonadjacent vertices under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2\n- Statement: If \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2 and u,v are nonadjacent, then |N(u) \u2229 N(v)| \u2265 2.\n- Proof: |N(u) \u222a N(v)| \u2264 n \u2212 2, so |N(u) \u2229 N(v)| = deg(u)+deg(v) \u2212 |N(u) \u222a N(v)| \u2265 n \u2212 (n \u2212 2) = 2. \u220e\n- Why useful: Strengthens structural understanding; helpful for rotation\u2011extension arguments and implies the next corollary.\n\n3) Diameter bound under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2\n- Statement: If \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2 then diam(G) \u2264 2.\n- Proof: Any nonadjacent pair shares at least one common neighbor (indeed \u2265 2 by the previous lemma), so every pair is at distance \u2264 2. \u220e\n- Why useful: Sanity check and auxiliary tool; often used in alternative Hamiltonicity proofs.\n\nSanity\u2011check example at the threshold\n- Example: For even n, K_{n/2,n/2} satisfies \u03b4 = n/2 and is Hamiltonian (alternate between parts to get an n\u2011cycle). Under the closure process, all nonedges lie within parts and are added (degree\u2011sum = n), producing K_n as expected. Why useful: Confirms correctness exactly at the boundary.\n\nOptional strengthening to record (standard, aligns with Lemma 4)\n4) Bondy\u2013Chv\u00e1tal closure theorem (statement and short justification)\n- Statement: Let cl(G) be obtained by repeatedly adding nonedges uv with deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n until no such pair remains. Then G is Hamiltonian iff cl(G) is Hamiltonian.\n- Justification sketch: Each single addition preserves Hamiltonicity equivalence by Lemma 4; hence any maximal sequence yields a final graph H with G Hamiltonian iff H is. The closure is unique (order\u2011independent) by the monotonicity of the rule (adding eligible edges cannot invalidate eligibility of others).

Refinements and recorded tools for the closure route to Dirac

Setting: Finite, simple, undirected graphs on n = |V(G)| ≥ 3; δ(G) is minimum degree. We index Hamiltonian paths as P = x_0,x_1,…,x_{n−1} with u = x_0 and v = x_{n−1}.

Path-closing lemma (indexing we will use): If P is Hamiltonian and deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, then G has a Hamiltonian cycle. If uv ∈ E, the path closes immediately. Otherwise define
- A = { i ∈ {1,…,n−2} : u is adjacent to x_i },
- B = { i ∈ {2,…,n−1} : v is adjacent to x_{i−1} }.
Because P spans all vertices and uv ∉ E, |A| = deg(u) and |B| = deg(v). For i ∈ {2,…,n−2}, the simultaneous occurrence i ∈ A ∩ B yields the Hamiltonian cycle u−x_i−…−v−x_{i−1}−…−u. If A ∩ B = ∅, then |A|+|B| ≤ (n−3) + 1 + 1 = n−1, contradicting deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n. Hence A ∩ B ≠ ∅ and the cycle exists.

Single-edge closure equivalence: If uv ∉ E(G) with deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, then G is Hamiltonian iff G+uv is Hamiltonian. The backward direction uses the path-closing lemma after removing uv from a Hamiltonian cycle in G+uv.

Closure under δ ≥ n/2: If δ(G) ≥ n/2, every nonedge uv satisfies deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n. Adding all such nonedges (degrees only increase) yields K_n. By the equivalence at each step, Hamiltonicity is preserved.

Immediate consequences recorded
- Connectivity: δ ≥ n/2 ⇒ G is connected.
- 2-connectivity: δ ≥ n/2 ⇒ G has no cut-vertex.
- Common neighbors under δ ≥ n/2: For nonadjacent u,v, |N(u)∪N(v)| ≤ n−2, so |N(u)∩N(v)| ≥ deg(u)+deg(v) − (n−2) ≥ 2. Thus any nonadjacent pair has at least two common neighbors. Useful for rotation–extension arguments.

Sharpness: For even n=2k, K_{k−1,k+1} has δ = k−1 = n/2−1 and is non-Hamiltonian (bipartite imbalance). For odd n=2k+1, K_{k,k+1} has δ = k = ⌊n/2⌋ and is non-Hamiltonian (all cycles even). Thus Dirac’s bound can’t be lowered.

What’s next
- Add Ore’s theorem as a corollary of the single-edge equivalence (no full closure needed).
- Prove the full Bondy–Chvátal closure theorem cl(G) is Hamiltonian iff G is.
- Optional: Pancyclicity strengthening (Bondy) under δ ≥ n/2, and a constructive extraction of a Hamiltonian cycle via closure plus the path-closing lemma.

Definitions and standing assumptions
- Graphs are finite, simple, undirected. Let n = |V(G)| ≥ 3. Write δ(G) for the minimum degree. A Hamiltonian path/cycle is a path/cycle on all n vertices.

Proposition 1 (Connectivity). If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then G is connected.
Proof. Suppose G is disconnected, and let C be a smallest component with |C| = s. Any v ∈ C has deg(v) ≤ s−1. If s ≤ n/2 then deg(v) ≤ n/2−1 < n/2, contradicting δ(G) ≥ n/2. Hence s ≥ n/2+1, but then the union of two components already has more than n vertices, a contradiction. ∎

Proposition 2 (2-connectivity). If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then G has no cut-vertex.
Proof. Suppose w is a cut-vertex. Let the components of G−w be H_1,…,H_t with t ≥ 2, and set s = min_i |V(H_i)|. For any x in a smallest component, x has neighbors only within that component and possibly w, so deg(x) ≤ (s−1)+1 = s. Since s ≤ (n−1)/2, we get deg(x) ≤ (n−1)/2 < n/2, contradicting δ(G) ≥ n/2. ∎

Lemma 3 (Path-closing). Let P = x_0,x_1,…,x_{n−1} be a Hamiltonian path in G with endpoints u = x_0 and v = x_{n−1}. If deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, then G has a Hamiltonian cycle.
Proof. If uv ∈ E(G), adding uv closes P into a Hamiltonian cycle. Assume uv ∉ E(G). Define
A = { i ∈ {1,…,n−2} : u is adjacent to x_i },
B = { i ∈ {2,…,n−1} : v is adjacent to x_{i−1} }.
Because P spans all vertices and uv ∉ E(G), every neighbor of u (resp. v) lies among x_1,…,x_{n−2}, so |A| = deg(u) and |B| = deg(v). For i ∈ {2,…,n−2}, if both u∼x_i and v∼x_{i−1} hold (i.e., i ∈ A ∩ B), then the cycle
u, x_i, x_{i+1}, …, x_{n−1}(=v), x_{i−1}, x_{i−2}, …, x_0(=u)
uses edges of P plus the two chords and spans all vertices. If A ∩ B = ∅, then among the (n−3) indices i ∈ {2,…,n−2} at most one of i ∈ A or i ∈ B can occur each time, and additionally index 1 can contribute only to A and index n−1 only to B. Hence |A|+|B| ≤ (n−3)+1+1 = n−1, contradicting deg(u)+deg(v) = |A|+|B| ≥ n. Therefore A ∩ B ≠ ∅ and the Hamiltonian cycle exists. ∎

Lemma 4 (Single-edge closure equivalence). Let uv ∉ E(G) with deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, and let G′ = G + uv. Then G is Hamiltonian if and only if G′ is Hamiltonian.
Proof. If G is Hamiltonian then so is the supergraph G′. Conversely, suppose G′ has a Hamiltonian cycle. If the cycle avoids uv, it is a Hamiltonian cycle of G. If it uses uv, then deleting uv yields a Hamiltonian path in G with endpoints u and v; apply Lemma 3 to conclude that G is Hamiltonian. ∎

Lemma 5 (Closure to K_n under δ ≥ n/2). If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then for every nonedge {u,v} we have deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n. Iteratively adding all such nonedges yields K_n.
Proof. Under δ(G) ≥ n/2, any two vertices satisfy deg(u) ≥ n/2 and deg(v) ≥ n/2, so deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n. Adding a nonedge can only increase degrees, so the degree-sum condition persists for remaining nonedges. After finitely many additions, all nonedges are added and the resulting graph is K_n. ∎

Theorem 6 (Dirac’s theorem). Let G be a graph on n ≥ 3 vertices. If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then G is Hamiltonian.
Proof. By Lemma 5 we may add all nonedges with degree-sum at least n to obtain K_n. By Lemma 4, Hamiltonicity is preserved (equivalently) at each addition, so G is Hamiltonian if and only if K_n is. Since K_n has a Hamiltonian cycle for n ≥ 3, G is Hamiltonian. ∎

Proposition 7 (Sharpness of the bound). The threshold n/2 cannot be lowered.
(a) For even n = 2k, the graph K_{k−1, k+1} has δ = k−1 = n/2−1 and is not Hamiltonian (a Hamiltonian cycle in a bipartite graph must alternate evenly, impossible with parts of different sizes).
(b) For odd n = 2k+1, the graph K_{k, k+1} has δ = k = ⌊n/2⌋ and is not Hamiltonian (all cycles in bipartite graphs are even, but n is odd).
Thus the bound n/2 is best possible up to rounding. ∎
