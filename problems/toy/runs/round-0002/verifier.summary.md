- The prover correctly identifies Dirac's Theorem as supporting the claim that graphs with minimum degree ≥ n/2 are Hamiltonian, provided n ≥ 3.
- The attempted counterexample (square graph with n = 4) actually supports Dirac's Theorem, as it is Hamiltonian.
- Further exploration of edge cases, a more rigorous argumentation, and a deeper theoretical examination of Dirac's Theorem are needed.
- Suggested next steps include a literature review, testing the claim with various graph configurations, and a detailed examination of Dirac's Theorem.
