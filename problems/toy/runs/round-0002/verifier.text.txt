The end of Prop. 1 could be made slightly more explicit (why “two components” force > n vertices), but it is logically fine: if the smallest component has size s ≥ n/2 + 1 and there are ≥ 2 components, then two components contribute at least 2s ≥ n + 2 vertices, impossible.\n- Lemma 3 (path-closing) is sound. The disjointness accounting over indices {2,…,n−2} and the treatment of endpoints i = 1 and i = n − 1 correctly yield |A| + |B| ≤ n − 1 under A ∩ B = ∅, contradicting deg(u) + deg(v) ≥ n. The definitions of A and B explicitly avoid counting uv and ensure |A| = deg(u), |B| = deg(v).\n- Lemma 4 (single-edge closure equivalence) is used with degree sums measured in the current graph at each step of augmentation; the statement already uses degrees in G for one step, which is exactly what is needed for iterative application.\n- Lemma 5 and Theorem 6 (Dirac) are standard and correct.

Let G be a graph on n ≥ 3 vertices such that for every nonadjacent pair u, v we have deg(u) + deg(v) ≥ n. Then G is Hamiltonian.\nProof. Enumerate the nonedges of G arbitrarily and add them one by one. Degrees only increase, so at each step the current nonedge uv being added satisfies deg(u) + deg(v) ≥ n in the current graph. By Lemma 4, each single addition preserves Hamiltonicity equivalence. The final graph is K_n, which is Hamiltonian; thus the original G is Hamiltonian. ∎\n\nTheorem 11 (Bondy–Chvátal closure equivalence). Let G be a graph on n ≥ 3 vertices. Define the operator Φ by\nΦ(H) = H + { uv ∉ E(H) : deg_H(u) + deg_H(v) ≥ n }.\nLet cl(G) = Φ^m(G) for any m large enough that Φ^m(G) = Φ^{m+1}(G) (this stabilization occurs since the edge set is finite). Then G is Hamiltonian if and only if cl(G) is Hamiltonian. Moreover, cl(G) is the unique graph obtainable from G by repeatedly adding nonedges uv with deg(current u) + deg(current v) ≥ n until none remain, independent of the order of additions.\nProof. Uniqueness/order-independence: Consider the chain H_0 = G, H_{t+1} = Φ(H_t). Since |E| is finite, H_t stabilizes at some m with H_m = Φ(H_m); set cl(G) = H_m. Let G = G_0 ⊂ G_1 ⊂ ··· ⊂ G_s = H be any maximal chain obtained by adding one eligible nonedge at each step, stopping when no such pair remains. First, by monotonicity of Φ we have G_i ⊆ Φ^i(G) for all i (induction: if G_i ⊆ Φ^i(G), then G_{i+1} ⊆ Φ(G_i) ⊆ Φ(Φ^i(G)) = Φ^{i+1}(G)). Hence H ⊆ Φ^s(G) ⊆ cl(G). Conversely, since H has no eligible nonedges, Φ(H) = H; thus for all k, Φ^k(G) ⊆ Φ^k(H) = H by monotonicity, and in particular cl(G) ⊆ H. Therefore H = cl(G), proving order-independence and uniqueness.\nEquivalence of Hamiltonicity: At each stage, the set Φ(H_t) \\ E(H_t) consists of nonedges uv whose degree sums are ≥ n in H_t. Enumerating these edges one by one yields a chain of single-edge additions from H_t to H_{t+1}; concatenating over t = 0, 1, …, m − 1 gives a chain from G to cl(G) where each added edge satisfies the degree-sum condition in the current graph. By Lemma 4, each addition preserves Hamiltonicity equivalence; composing these equivalences yields that G is Hamiltonian iff cl(G) is. ∎", "new_outputs_append": "True", "verdict": "success"}
