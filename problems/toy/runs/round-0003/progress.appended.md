**Mini-plan:**
- Investigate the theoretical underpinnings and proof of Dirac's Theorem to identify foundational assumptions.
- Explore a broader range of graph configurations with higher numbers of vertices to test the claim under various conditions.
- Examine potential limitations or conditions that might affect the applicability of Dirac's Theorem.

**Small examples:**
- Consider graphs with slightly more complex structures than the simple square, such as a pentagon or hexagon, where the minimum degree still meets or exceeds n/2. These examples can help illustrate the theorem's applicability to a broader range of configurations.

**Candidate lemmas:**
- A lemma stating that any graph with minimum degree \\(
\\) and a number of vertices \\(
\\) must have a connected subgraph of size \\(
/2\\) could be useful. This can help in proving that there are enough edges to potentially form a Hamiltonian cycle.
- Another lemma might involve the connectivity and path extension properties in graphs, showing that under certain conditions, paths can be extended to form cycles.

**Obstacles:**
- One major obstacle is proving the theorem for graphs that are not obviously Hamiltonian, such as those with complex internal structures or irregular connectivity patterns.
- Another challenge is ensuring that the conditions of Dirac's Theorem are met without exception, especially in edge cases or under specific configurations that might not have been fully considered.

**Next moves:**
- Conduct a detailed examination of the proof of Dirac's Theorem to understand its assumptions and limitations.
- Use the candidate lemmas to explore more complex graph configurations, testing the theorem's applicability and searching for potential counterexamples.
- Review literature for any exceptions to Dirac's Theorem or conditions under which the theorem might not hold, to ensure a comprehensive understanding of its scope and limitations.
