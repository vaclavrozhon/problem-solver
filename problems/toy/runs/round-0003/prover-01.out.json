  "progress_md": "## Audit of outputs.md (correctness and small clarifications)\n- The closure-based proof of Dirac\u2019s theorem is complete and correct. Lemma 3 (path\u2011closing), Lemma 4 (single\u2011edge closure equivalence), Lemma 5 (iteration to K_n under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2), and Theorem 6 (Dirac) form a logically tight chain.\n- Proposition 1 (connectivity) and Proposition 2 (2\u2011connectivity) are sound. A minor clarity option for Prop. 1: explicitly note that \u201cdisconnected\u201d implies at least two components, hence two of size \u2265 s \u2265 n/2+1 would already exceed n.\n- Lemma 3 indexing is carefully handled: A = {1,\u2026,n\u22122} and B = {2,\u2026,n\u22121} ensure |A| = deg(u), |B| = deg(v) under uv \u2209 E. The counting yielding |A|+|B| \u2264 n\u22121 when A\u2229B=\u2205 is correct.\n- Theorem 11 (Bondy\u2013Chv\u00e1tal closure) proof properly uses monotonicity of \u03a6 (degrees only increase) to establish uniqueness/order\u2011independence and chains Lemma 4 to get equivalence.\n- No gaps or errors detected in outputs.md.\n\n## New, small results and refinements to consider adding\n1) Minimal\u2011counterexample proof of Ore\u2019s Theorem (short alternative)\n- Statement (Ore): If for every nonadjacent u,v we have deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n, then G is Hamiltonian.\n- Proof idea: Suppose not, and let G be a minimal (by edges) counterexample. Then for some nonedge uv, G+uv has strictly more edges and still satisfies Ore\u2019s condition for remaining nonedges (degrees increased). By minimality, G+uv is Hamiltonian. By Lemma 4 (single\u2011edge closure equivalence), G would then be Hamiltonian, a contradiction. Hence no counterexample exists. Why useful: Distills the role of Lemma 4 to a one\u2011line argument; complements the iterative proof already in outputs.md.\n\n2) Corollary (closing any Hamiltonian path under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2)\n- Statement: If G has a Hamiltonian path with endpoints u,v and \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2, then G has a Hamiltonian cycle.\n- Proof: Apply Lemma 3 with deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n (since each \u2265 n/2). Why useful: An immediate, often\u2011used corollary worth stating explicitly.\n\n3) Perfect matching consequences\n- Corollary (even n): If n is even and \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2, then G has a perfect matching.\n  Proof: Take a Hamiltonian cycle (Theorem 6) and alternate its edges.\n- Corollary (odd n): If n is odd and \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2, then G has a near\u2011perfect matching of size (n\u22121)/2.\n  Proof: Remove any vertex from a Hamiltonian cycle and alternate along the remaining path. Why useful: Provides immediate structural consequences often needed in applications.\n\n4) Algorithmic extraction of a Hamiltonian cycle (formalized)\n- Given G with \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 and adjacency access, the reverse\u2011closure method yields a Hamiltonian cycle in O(n^2) time (with adjacency matrix; O(m+n^2) with lists):\n  \u2022 Compute the closure (here one application of \u03a6 suffices to reach K_n), recording added edges in order e_1,\u2026,e_t.\n  \u2022 Start with any n\u2011cycle C_t in K_n.\n  \u2022 For i = t, t\u22121, \u2026, 1: if e_i \u2209 E(C_i) set C_{i\u22121} = C_i; else let e_i = uv, delete uv from C_i to get a Hamiltonian u\u2013v path P in G_{i\u22121}, and apply Lemma 3 to re\u2011close P into a Hamiltonian cycle C_{i\u22121} of G_{i\u22121}.\n  \u2022 Output C_0.\n  Correctness invariant: At step i we maintain a Hamiltonian cycle in G_i; Lemma 3 ensures we can eliminate the dependence on e_i if it is used. Why useful: Converts the existential proof into a constructive one with a clear complexity bound.\n\n5) Circumference viewpoint (alternative route; optional for appendix)\n- Theorem (Dirac\u2019s circumference bound): If G is 2\u2011connected on n vertices with minimum degree \u03b4, then its circumference c(G) \u2265 min{n, 2\u03b4}. Under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 this gives c(G) \u2265 n, i.e., Hamiltonian.\n- Why useful here: Provides a classic alternative proof strategy; stating this as an appendix (with reference or a sketch) situates Dirac\u2019s theorem among standard extremal cycle results.\n\n## Examples / sanity checks\n- Balanced bipartite K_{n/2,n/2}: \u03b4 = n/2, Hamiltonian, triangle\u2011free, and closure adds all intra\u2011part edges in one step to reach K_n; consistent with Lemma 4.\n- Sharpness (already in outputs.md): K_{k\u22121,k+1} (even n) and K_{k,k+1} (odd n) are non\u2011Hamiltonian at \u03b4 = \u230an/2\u230b \u2212 1 and \u03b4 = \u230an/2\u230b respectively.\n\n## Obstacles / delicate points\n- Pancyclic strengthening (Bondy): Proving that \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 implies pancyclicity unless G \u2245 K_{n/2,n/2} requires additional nontrivial arguments (rotation\u2013extension or specialized closure analysis). This is beyond the current scope but is a natural next target.\n\n## Next steps for outputs.md\n- Optionally append: (i) the short minimal\u2011counterexample proof of Ore; (ii) the \u201cclose any Hamiltonian path\u201d corollary; (iii) perfect/near\u2011perfect matching corollaries; and (iv) the formal algorithmic construction and its complexity. These are short, checkable additions that enhance applicability without altering the main proof."
