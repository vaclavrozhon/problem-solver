{"progress_md":"## Audit of outputs.md (correctness and small clarifications)\n- The closure-based proof of Dirac’s theorem is complete and correct. Lemma 3 (path‑closing), Lemma 4 (single‑edge closure equivalence), Lemma 5 (iteration to K_n under δ ≥ n/2), and Theorem 6 (Dirac) form a logically tight chain.\n- Proposition 1 (connectivity) and Proposition 2 (2‑connectivity) are sound. A minor clarity option for Prop. 1: explicitly note that “disconnected” implies at least two components, hence two of size ≥ s ≥ n/2+1 would already exceed n.\n- Lemma 3 indexing is carefully handled: A = {1,…,n−2} and B = {2,…,n−1} ensure |A| = deg(u), |B| = deg(v) under uv ∉ E. The counting yielding |A|+|B| ≤ n−1 when A∩B=∅ is correct.\n- Theorem 11 (Bondy–Chvátal closure) proof properly uses monotonicity of Φ (degrees only increase) to establish uniqueness/order‑independence and chains Lemma 4 to get equivalence.\n- No gaps or errors detected in outputs.md.\n\n## New, small results and refinements to consider adding\n1) Minimal‑counterexample proof of Ore’s Theorem (short alternative)\n- Statement (Ore): If for every nonadjacent u,v we have deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, then G is Hamiltonian.\n- Proof idea: Suppose not, and let G be a minimal (by edges) counterexample. Then for some nonedge uv, G+uv has strictly more edges and still satisfies Ore’s condition for remaining nonedges (degrees increased). By minimality, G+uv is Hamiltonian. By Lemma 4 (single‑edge closure equivalence), G would then be Hamiltonian, a contradiction. Hence no counterexample exists. Why useful: Distills the role of Lemma 4 to a one‑line argument; complements the iterative proof already in outputs.md.\n\n2) Corollary (closing any Hamiltonian path under δ ≥ n/2)\n- Statement: If G has a Hamiltonian path with endpoints u,v and δ(G) ≥ n/2, then G has a Hamiltonian cycle.\n- Proof: Apply Lemma 3 with deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n (since each ≥ n/2). Why useful: An immediate, often‑used corollary worth stating explicitly.\n\n3) Perfect matching consequences\n- Corollary (even n): If n is even and δ(G) ≥ n/2, then G has a perfect matching.\n  Proof: Take a Hamiltonian cycle (Theorem 6) and alternate its edges.\n- Corollary (odd n): If n is odd and δ(G) ≥ n/2, then G has a near‑perfect matching of size (n−1)/2.\n  Proof: Remove any vertex from a Hamiltonian cycle and alternate along the remaining path. Why useful: Provides immediate structural consequences often needed in applications.\n\n4) Algorithmic extraction of a Hamiltonian cycle (formalized)\n- Given G with δ ≥ n/2 and adjacency access, the reverse‑closure method yields a Hamiltonian cycle in O(n^2) time (with adjacency matrix; O(m+n^2) with lists):\n  • Compute the closure (here one application of Φ suffices to reach K_n), recording added edges in order e_1,…,e_t.\n  • Start with any n‑cycle C_t in K_n.\n  • For i = t, t−1, …, 1: if e_i ∉ E(C_i) set C_{i−1} = C_i; else let e_i = uv, delete uv from C_i to get a Hamiltonian u–v path P in G_{i−1}, and apply Lemma 3 to re‑close P into a Hamiltonian cycle C_{i−1} of G_{i−1}.\n  • Output C_0.\n  Correctness invariant: At step i we maintain a Hamiltonian cycle in G_i; Lemma 3 ensures we can eliminate the dependence on e_i if it is used. Why useful: Converts the existential proof into a constructive one with a clear complexity bound.\n\n5) Circumference viewpoint (alternative route; optional for appendix)\n- Theorem (Dirac’s circumference bound): If G is 2‑connected on n vertices with minimum degree δ, then its circumference c(G) ≥ min{n, 2δ}. Under δ ≥ n/2 this gives c(G) ≥ n, i.e., Hamiltonian.\n- Why useful here: Provides a classic alternative proof strategy; stating this as an appendix (with reference or a sketch) situates Dirac’s theorem among standard extremal cycle results.\n\n## Examples / sanity checks\n- Balanced bipartite K_{n/2,n/2}: δ = n/2, Hamiltonian, triangle‑free, and closure adds all intra‑part edges in one step to reach K_n; consistent with Lemma 4.\n- Sharpness (already in outputs.md): K_{k−1,k+1} (even n) and K_{k,k+1} (odd n) are non‑Hamiltonian at δ = ⌊n/2⌋ − 1 and δ = ⌊n/2⌋ respectively.\n\n## Obstacles / delicate points\n- Pancyclic strengthening (Bondy): Proving that δ ≥ n/2 implies pancyclicity unless G ≅ K_{n/2,n/2} requires additional nontrivial arguments (rotation–extension or specialized closure analysis). This is beyond the current scope but is a natural next target.\n\n## Next steps for outputs.md\n- Optionally append: (i) the short minimal‑counterexample proof of Ore; (ii) the “close any Hamiltonian path” corollary; (iii) perfect/near‑perfect matching corollaries; and (iv) the formal algorithmic construction and its complexity. These are short, checkable additions that enhance applicability without altering the main proof."}
