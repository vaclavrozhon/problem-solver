Lemma 3 (path-closing), Lemma 4 (single-edge closure equivalence), Lemma 5 (iterative augmentation), and Theorem 6 (Dirac) are logically tight. The added corollaries (two common neighbors; diameter \u2264 2), Ore\u2019s theorem, and the Bondy\u2013Chv\u00e1tal closure equivalence are also correct as stated and proved.\n- Proposition 1 (connectivity): The final sentence could be made more explicit. Let s be the size of the smallest component and assume s \u2265 n/2 + 1. Since there is another component and by minimality all components have size \u2265 s, pick any other component C\u2032; then |C| + |C\u2032| \u2265 2s > n, contradiction. (Equivalently, if there are exactly two components, n \u2212 s \u2265 s must hold by minimality, forcing s \u2264 n/2; contradiction to s \u2265 n/2 + 1.) The current proof hints at this but does not state \u201cthe other component has size \u2265 s by minimality.\u201d\n- Lemma 3 (path-closing): The indexing and counting are sound. A small clarity note: explicitly mention that B indexes neighbors of v via i \u21a6 i \u2212 1, so |B| = deg(v); this is already indicated but worth one explicit sentence in outputs.md.\n- Theorem 11 (closure equivalence): The monotonicity and order-independence arguments are correct. The decomposition of \u03a6-steps into single-edge additions is valid since eligibility persists under degree increases.\n\n## New, small results and why useful\n1) Lemma (Triangle or balanced bipartite under Dirac). Let G be on n \u2265 3 vertices with \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2. Then either G contains a triangle, or n is even and G \u2245 K_{n/2,n/2}.\n- Proof: If G is triangle-free, Mantel\u2019s theorem gives e(G) \u2264 \u230an^2/4\u230b. But e(G) \u2265 n\u03b4(G)/2 \u2265 n(n/2)/2 = n^2/4, hence e(G) = n^2/4 and G attains Mantel\u2019s extremal case, so G \u2245 K_{\u230an/2\u230b, \u2308n/2\u2309}. Under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 this forces n even and \u03b4 = n/2, hence G \u2245 K_{n/2,n/2}. Otherwise G has a triangle. \u220e\n- Why useful: This is a first structural dichotomy toward Bondy\u2019s pancyclicity strengthening (Dirac graphs are pancyclic unless G \u2245 K_{n/2,n/2}). It also supplies a quick certificate of non-bipartiteness for most Dirac graphs.\n\n2) Worked example validating Lemma 3 (path-closing) on a tight instance.\n- Let G = K_4 \u2212 x_0x_3 (the \u201cdiamond\u201d), n = 4. Take P = x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3 with u = x_0, v = x_3. Here deg(u) = deg(v) = 2 and uv \u2209 E(G), so deg(u) + deg(v) = 4 = n. Compute A = {i \u2208 {1,2} : u \u223c x_i} = {1,2}; B = {i \u2208 {2,3} : v \u223c x_{i\u22121}} = {2,3}. Then A \u2229 B contains i = 2, providing the Hamiltonian cycle x_0, x_2, x_3, x_1, x_0 as in Lemma 3. This illustrates the indexing and the closing mechanism at the threshold.\n\n3) Algorithmic note (constructing a Hamiltonian cycle under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2)\n- Idea: Use the closure chain and reverse it, maintaining a Hamiltonian cycle at each step.\n- Outline:\n  1) Build a sequence G = G_0 \u2286 G_1 \u2286 \u2026 \u2286 G_m = K_n where each G_{i+1} = G_i + u_iv_i with deg_{G_i}(u_i) + deg_{G_i}(v_i) \u2265 n (existence by Lemma 5).\n  2) Pick any Hamiltonian cycle C_m in K_n (e.g., 1\u20132\u2013\u2026\u2013n\u20131).\n  3) For i = m \u2212 1 down to 0: if C_{i+1} uses u_iv_i, delete that edge to get a Hamiltonian u_i\u2013v_i path in G_{i+1}; by Lemma 3 applied in G_i (note deg_{G_i}(u_i) + deg_{G_i}(v_i) \u2265 n), reclose to a Hamiltonian cycle C_i in G_i avoiding u_iv_i. If C_{i+1} does not use u_iv_i, set C_i = C_{i+1}.\n- Invariant: At each step we maintain a Hamiltonian cycle of the current graph. Complexity: O(n^2)\u2013O(n^3) depending on data structures (closure computation O(n^2) nonedge checks; each step\u2019s reclosure is O(n)).\n- Why useful: Gives a constructive certificate and a concrete procedure implementable from the curated lemmas.\n\n## Examples and sanity checks\n- C_4 (n = 4) has \u03b4 = 2 = n/2 and is Hamiltonian; the closure adds both diagonals (each nonedge has degree-sum 4), yielding K_4, consistent with Lemma 5 and Theorem 6.\n- Balanced bipartite extremal: K_{n/2,n/2} (n even) has \u03b4 = n/2 and is Hamiltonian but not pancyclic (no odd cycles); it realizes equality in Corollary 8 with large common neighborhoods and matches Lemma (1) when triangle-free.\n\n## Obstacles and cautions\n- Pancyclicity: The closure equivalence does not by itself preserve pancyclicity, so one cannot immediately lift pancyclic cycles from K_n back to G via Lemma 3. Bondy\u2019s theorem on pancyclicity at e(G) \u2265 n^2/4 addresses this; a careful proof requires additional arguments beyond the current toolkit.\n- Equality m = n^2/4: There exist \u03b4-regular Dirac graphs with \u03b4 = n/2 and e(G) = n^2/4 that are not bipartite; Mantel\u2019s extremal characterization applies only under triangle-free assumption.\n\n## Next steps (suggested additions to outputs.md)\n- Add Lemma (Triangle or balanced bipartite under Dirac) with the short Mantel-based proof above.\n- Optionally add the constructive algorithm note with a brief invariant proof (as above) and a complexity remark.\n- Plan a pancyclicity strengthening: Record Bondy\u2019s theorem (1971): If G is Hamiltonian and e(G) \u2265 n^2/4, then G is pancyclic unless G \u2245 K_{n/2,n/2}; outline a route to adapt/curate a proof, using the triangle lemma and rotation\u2013extension or Bondy\u2013Chv\u00e1tal techniques.\n"
