## Round 0001 — 2025-08-27T14:35:41.823619Z

Status and gaps
- outputs.md was not provided in this round, so I cannot audit what has been formally curated. From the summaries/notes, the planned closure-based proof is the right route, but key steps still need fully written, checkable proofs: (i) the path-closing lemma on a Hamiltonian path under a degree-sum condition; (ii) the single-edge closure equivalence; (iii) the iteration to K_n under δ ≥ n/2; and (iv) brief proofs of connectivity and 2-connectivity under δ ≥ n/2. I supply clean statements and proofs below, aligned with the indexing convention in notes.md, and note any delicate points.

Setup
- Graphs are finite, simple, undirected; n = |V(G)| ≥ 3. A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle through all n vertices.
- Dirac’s theorem target: If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then G is Hamiltonian. This resolves the task in the affirmative.

Ideas (plan of attack)
- Use Bondy–Chvátal-style single-edge closure: nonedge uv with deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n is “safe” to add w.r.t. Hamiltonicity (equivalence). Prove via the path-closing lemma along a Hamiltonian path obtained by removing uv from a Hamiltonian cycle in G+uv.
- Under δ ≥ n/2, every nonedge satisfies the degree-sum condition, so iterating the closure adds all missing edges and yields K_n. Since equivalence holds at each step and K_n is Hamiltonian, G is Hamiltonian.
- Add short lemmas: δ ≥ n/2 implies connected and indeed 2-connected; sharpness examples at δ = ⌈n/2⌉−1.

Key lemmas with proofs (auditable)
1) Connectivity and 2‑connectivity from δ ≥ n/2
- Claim (connectivity): If δ(G) ≥ n/2, G is connected.
  Proof sketch: If disconnected with components of sizes a ≤ b, then any vertex in the smaller component has degree ≤ a−1 ≤ ⌊(n−1)/2⌋ < n/2, contradiction.
- Claim (2‑connectivity): If δ(G) ≥ n/2, G has no cut-vertex.
  Proof sketch: Suppose x is a cut-vertex, and G−x has components of sizes p ≤ q with p+q = n−1. Any vertex u in the smaller component has deg(u) ≤ (p−1)+1 = p ≤ ⌊(n−1)/2⌋ < n/2, contradiction.
  Why useful: Removes earlier misconception about disconnected counterexamples; ensures robust structure for Hamiltonicity arguments.

2) Path‑closing lemma (notes.md indexing)
- Statement: Let G be on n vertices and let P = x_0, x_1, …, x_{n−1} be a Hamiltonian path with endpoints u = x_0 and v = x_{n−1}. If deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, then G has a Hamiltonian cycle.
- Proof: If uv ∈ E(G), we are done. Assume uv ∉ E(G). Define
  A = { i ∈ {1,…,n−2} : u is adjacent to x_i },
  B = { i ∈ {2,…,n−1} : v is adjacent to x_{i−1} }.
  Because P spans all vertices and uv ∉ E, we have |A| = deg(u) and |B| = deg(v) (the indexing omits the impossible end-neighbor). Suppose, for contradiction, that A ∩ B = ∅. Then, for each i ∈ {2,…,n−2}, at most one of the adjacencies u∼x_i or v∼x_{i−1} holds; also, i=1 can contribute to A only and i=n−1 can contribute to B only. Hence |A|+|B| ≤ (n−3)+1+1 = n−1. Therefore deg(u)+deg(v) ≤ n−1, contradicting the hypothesis deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n. Thus A ∩ B ≠ ∅; choose i ∈ A ∩ B. Then u∼x_i and v∼x_{i−1}, and the cycle u, x_i, x_{i+1}, …, x_{n−1}(=v), x_{i−1}, x_{i−2}, …, x_0(=u) uses edges of P plus the two chords and spans all vertices. So G is Hamiltonian. QED.
  Why useful: This is the central combinatorial step used in closure proofs.

3) Single‑edge closure equivalence
- Statement: Let G be on n vertices and uv ∉ E(G) with deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n. Then G is Hamiltonian iff G+uv is Hamiltonian.
- Proof: “⇒” is trivial since adding edges preserves Hamiltonicity. For “⇐”, suppose G+uv has a Hamiltonian cycle. If the cycle avoids uv, it is a Hamiltonian cycle in G. If it uses uv, then removing uv yields a Hamiltonian path in G with endpoints u and v; apply the path‑closing lemma to conclude G is Hamiltonian. QED.
  Why useful: Allows iterative addition of all “Ore-eligible” nonedges while preserving Hamiltonicity equivalence.

4) Iteration to K_n under δ ≥ n/2
- Observation: If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then for any distinct u,v we have deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n. In particular, every nonedge uv meets the hypothesis of the single‑edge closure equivalence.
- Iteration: Enumerate the nonedges uv_1, uv_2, … arbitrarily and add them one-by-one. At each addition, degrees do not decrease, so the degree‑sum condition remains valid for all remaining nonedges. By the equivalence lemma, Hamiltonicity is preserved both ways at each step. When all nonedges are added, the resulting graph is K_n, which is Hamiltonian for n ≥ 3. Hence the original G is Hamiltonian. QED (Dirac).
  Why useful: Completes the closure route from δ ≥ n/2 to Hamiltonicity.

5) Sharpness examples (cannot lower the bound)
- Even n = 2k: Let G = K_{k−1, k+1}. Then δ(G) = k−1 = n/2 − 1. Any Hamiltonian cycle in a bipartite graph must alternate parts, so it uses equal numbers from each part; since the parts have sizes k−1 and k+1, no Hamiltonian cycle exists. Shows the n/2 bound cannot be decreased.
- Odd n = 2k+1: Let G = K_{k, k+1}. Then δ(G) = k = ⌊n/2⌋ < ⌈n/2⌉. By parity/alternation, no Hamiltonian cycle exists (a Hamiltonian cycle would have even length n). Shows that replacing n/2 by ⌊n/2⌋ fails.

Small auxiliary facts (optional but clean)
- Diameter ≤ 2 under δ ≥ n/2: For nonadjacent u,v, |N(u)|+|N(v)| ≥ n, so they share a neighbor; hence dist(u,v) = 2. Not essential, but often used heuristically.
- Longest path bound: Every graph has a path with at least δ(G)+1 vertices. Proof: Let P be a longest path of length ℓ (ℓ+1 vertices). An endpoint x has all neighbors on P, so deg(x) ≤ ℓ. Hence ℓ ≥ δ(G), giving ℓ+1 ≥ δ(G)+1. Not used in the closure route, but consistent with the summaries.

Examples / sanity checks
- n=3: δ ≥ 3/2 ⇒ δ ≥ 2, so G = K_3, which is Hamiltonian. Base case aligns with Dirac.
- Complete bipartite K_{n/2, n/2} (n even): δ = n/2; it is Hamiltonian (indeed has many Hamiltonian cycles). Under closure, every nonedge is within a part and gets added (degree-sum = n), ultimately giving K_n, consistent with the equivalence lemma.

Obstacles / delicate points to watch
- Indexing in the path‑closing lemma: adhering to A = {1,…,n−2} and B = {2,…,n−1} avoids the trivial non-neighbor positions and makes |A|=deg(u), |B|=deg(v) precise. Any writeup should explicitly justify those equalities because they rely on P being Hamiltonian and uv ∉ E.
- Ensure the “equivalence” direction in the closure step is stated and proved; some expositions only show the forward implication, which is not enough for iteration by equivalence.

Next steps (for outputs.md)
- Add the fully written proofs of Lemmas 1–4 above, with the exact indexing as recorded here; this is a complete, rigorous closure-based proof of Dirac’s theorem for n ≥ 3.
- Include the 2-connectivity lemma and both sharpness examples, as brief propositions with proofs.
- Optionally append an Ore/Pósa alternative proof for completeness (not needed for the main result).
- Verify definitions section explicitly states the class of graphs and n ≥ 3 to avoid n=2 edge-case confusion.

## Round 0001 — 2025-08-27T14:35:49.057947Z

Status and gaps
- outputs.md not provided in this round; I assume no curated, fully rigorous proof has yet been recorded. I will propose a clean closure-based proof plan with self-contained lemmas and give complete proofs suitable for outputs.md. I also flag small technical points to watch (endpoints, index ranges, n ≥ 3).

Plan (closure route to Dirac)
- Prove the path-closing lemma: a Hamiltonian path with endpoints u,v and deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n closes to a Hamiltonian cycle. Why useful: it is the local engine for the Bondy–Chvátal single-edge step.
- Deduce the single-edge closure equivalence: adding a nonedge uv with deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n preserves Hamiltonicity (iff). Why useful: allows iterative augmentation without changing Hamiltonicity.
- Under δ(G) ≥ n/2, every nonedge has deg-sum ≥ n, so the iterative closure yields K_n; therefore G is Hamiltonian. Why useful: completes Dirac’s theorem.
- Record connectivity and 2-connectivity consequences of δ ≥ n/2 and sharpness examples. Why useful: prevents false counterexamples and documents optimality of the bound.

Setting
- All graphs are finite, simple, undirected; n = |V(G)| ≥ 3. Write δ(G) for the minimum degree.

Lemma 1 (Connectivity from δ ≥ n/2)
- Claim: If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then G is connected.
- Proof: If G were disconnected, let C be a smallest component, |C| = s. Each v ∈ C has deg(v) ≤ s − 1. If s ≤ n/2 then deg(v) ≤ s − 1 ≤ n/2 − 1 < n/2, contradicting δ ≥ n/2. Hence s ≥ n/2 + 1, but two disjoint components then have ≥ (n/2 + 1) + (n/2 + 1) > n vertices, impossible. ∎

Lemma 2 (2-connectivity from δ ≥ n/2)
- Claim: If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then G has no cut-vertex.
- Proof: Suppose w is a cut-vertex. Let the components of G − w be H_1,…,H_t with t ≥ 2, and let s = min_i |V(H_i)|. For any x ∈ V(H_i) (the smallest one), x has neighbors only in H_i and possibly w, hence deg(x) ≤ (s − 1) + 1 = s. Also s ≤ (n − 1)/2, so deg(x) ≤ (n − 1)/2 < n/2, contradicting δ ≥ n/2. ∎

Lemma 3 (Path-closing lemma)
- Statement: Let G have a Hamiltonian path P = x_0 x_1 … x_{n−1} with endpoints u = x_0 and v = x_{n−1}. If uv ∉ E(G) and deg(u) + deg(v) ≥ n, then G has a Hamiltonian cycle.
- Proof (indexing per notes): Define
  A = { i ∈ {1,…,n−2} : u is adjacent to x_i },
  B = { i ∈ {2,…,n−1} : v is adjacent to x_{i−1} }.
  Because uv ∉ E(G), every neighbor of u lies among {x_1,…,x_{n−2}}, so |A| = deg(u). Likewise, every neighbor of v lies among {x_1,…,x_{n−2}}, so |B| = deg(v) (via the shift i ↦ i − 1).
  For each i ∈ {1,…,n−2}, we cannot have both edges u x_i and v x_{i−1}, because then the cycle
  x_0(=u) — x_i — x_{i+1} — … — x_{n−1}(=v) — x_{i−1} — x_{i−2} — … — x_1 — x_0
  would be a Hamiltonian cycle in G already. Equivalently, A and B′ := {i − 1 : i ∈ B} are disjoint subsets of {1,…,n−2}. Hence |A| + |B′| ≤ n − 2. But |B′| = |B|, so deg(u) + deg(v) = |A| + |B| = |A| + |B′| ≤ n − 2, contradicting deg(u) + deg(v) ≥ n. Therefore some i has both edges present, giving the Hamiltonian cycle as displayed. ∎
- Why useful: This is the core combinatorial step ensuring we can remove a “closure edge” from a Hamiltonian cycle and still recover Hamiltonicity in the original graph.

Lemma 4 (Single-edge closure equivalence)
- Statement: Let uv ∉ E(G) with deg(u) + deg(v) ≥ n, and let G′ = G + uv. Then G is Hamiltonian iff G′ is Hamiltonian.
- Proof: If G is Hamiltonian then so is its supergraph G′. Conversely, suppose G′ has a Hamiltonian cycle C. If C does not use uv, then C ⊆ G and we are done. If C uses uv, delete uv from C to obtain a Hamiltonian path P of G with endpoints u and v. Apply Lemma 3 to P and deg(u) + deg(v) ≥ n to conclude that G has a Hamiltonian cycle. ∎
- Why useful: Allows iterative addition of edges with deg-sum ≥ n without changing Hamiltonicity.

Lemma 5 (Closure to K_n under δ ≥ n/2)
- Claim: If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then for every nonadjacent pair {u,v}, deg(u) + deg(v) ≥ n. Consequently, adding all such nonedges yields K_n.
- Proof: δ(G) ≥ n/2 implies deg(u) ≥ n/2 and deg(v) ≥ n/2 for all u,v, so the sum is ≥ n. Add any nonedge uv; degrees only increase, so at any stage every remaining nonedge still has deg-sum ≥ n. Adding all of them produces a complete graph. ∎
- Why useful: Reduces Dirac to the trivial Hamiltonicity of K_n.

Theorem (Dirac)
- Statement: For n ≥ 3, every graph G with δ(G) ≥ n/2 is Hamiltonian.
- Proof: Iteratively add nonedges with deg-sum ≥ n to obtain K_n (Lemma 5). By Lemma 4, Hamiltonicity is preserved at each addition, so G is Hamiltonian iff K_n is, and K_n is Hamiltonian for n ≥ 3. ∎

Sharpness and examples
- Even n = 2k: The complete bipartite graph K_{k−1, k+1} has δ = k − 1 = n/2 − 1 and is not Hamiltonian (unbalanced bipartite graphs have no spanning cycle). Shows the bound cannot be lowered below n/2.
- Odd n = 2k + 1: K_{k, k+1} has δ = k = ⌊n/2⌋ and is not Hamiltonian (all cycles are even in bipartite graphs). Shows replacing n/2 by ⌊n/2⌋ would be false.

Checks and potential pitfalls
- n ≥ 3 is essential: for n = 2, δ ≥ n/2 = 1 gives K_2, which has no Hamiltonian cycle in simple graphs (no 2-cycles). Our theorem correctly excludes n = 2.
- Indexing in Lemma 3 carefully avoids referring to uv by restricting A to 1,…,n−2 and using the shifted B. The disjointness is proved on A and B′.
- Closure of K_{n/2, n/2} is indeed K_n: nonedges lie within parts, and each such pair has deg-sum = n, so all are added. No contradiction with Dirac (K_{n/2,n/2} itself is Hamiltonian for n ≥ 4).

Alternative route (for appendix)
- One can also derive Dirac via Ore’s theorem (if deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n for all nonadjacent u,v, then G is Hamiltonian), which in turn follows by the same single-edge closure lemma without fully iterating to K_n. Or via Pósa’s rotation-extension method plus a longest-path argument. These are optional and not needed for the main proof.

Next steps
- Curate Lemmas 1–5 and the Dirac theorem proof into outputs.md with explicit statements and proofs as above.
- Optionally add a brief note on 2-connectivity corollary and the sharpness examples.
- If desired, include a short Ore-style proof as an appendix for completeness.

## Round 0002 — audit, micro‑refinements, and useful corollaries

Status and audit of output.md
- The curated proof is complete and correct for Dirac’s theorem via the closure route. All key steps (path‑closing lemma, single‑edge closure equivalence, iterative augmentation to K_n) are present with correct indexing and boundary handling (n ≥ 3).
- Connectivity (Prop. 1) and 2‑connectivity (Prop. 2) are sound; the inequalities used are tight and standard.
- Path‑closing lemma (Lemma 3): The counting argument is valid. Minor clarity note (not a gap): it helps to explicitly remark that all neighbors of u (resp. v) lie among x_1,…,x_{n−2} because the path is Hamiltonian and uv ∉ E(G); this justifies |A| = deg(u), |B| = deg(v). The proof already indicates this.
- Single‑edge closure equivalence (Lemma 4) is correctly applied with degree sums taken in G (not in G+uv), which is essential.
- Iteration to K_n (Lemma 5) correctly notes that degrees only increase, so every remaining nonedge remains “eligible,” ensuring the equivalence step can be applied throughout.
- Sharpness examples are correct and well‑justified by bipartiteness.

New, small results to consider curating (each with “why useful”) 
1) Ore’s Theorem as an immediate corollary of Lemma 4
- Statement: If for every nonadjacent u,v in G we have deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, then G is Hamiltonian.
- Proof sketch: Iteratively add each nonedge uv (all are eligible by hypothesis). By Lemma 4, Hamiltonicity is preserved at each step, so G is Hamiltonian iff the final graph (K_n) is; hence G is Hamiltonian. ∎
- Why useful: It isolates the closure‑equivalence as the core engine and shows Dirac follows immediately from Ore (since δ ≥ n/2 implies Ore’s condition).

2) At least two common neighbors for nonadjacent vertices under δ ≥ n/2
- Statement: If δ(G) ≥ n/2 and u,v are nonadjacent, then |N(u) ∩ N(v)| ≥ 2.
- Proof: |N(u) ∪ N(v)| ≤ n − 2, so |N(u) ∩ N(v)| = deg(u)+deg(v) − |N(u) ∪ N(v)| ≥ n − (n − 2) = 2. ∎
- Why useful: Strengthens structural understanding; helpful for rotation‑extension arguments and implies the next corollary.

3) Diameter bound under δ ≥ n/2
- Statement: If δ(G) ≥ n/2 then diam(G) ≤ 2.
- Proof: Any nonadjacent pair shares at least one common neighbor (indeed ≥ 2 by the previous lemma), so every pair is at distance ≤ 2. ∎
- Why useful: Sanity check and auxiliary tool; often used in alternative Hamiltonicity proofs.

Sanity‑check example at the threshold
- Example: For even n, K_{n/2,n/2} satisfies δ = n/2 and is Hamiltonian (alternate between parts to get an n‑cycle). Under the closure process, all nonedges lie within parts and are added (degree‑sum = n), producing K_n as expected. Why useful: Confirms correctness exactly at the boundary.

Optional strengthening to record (standard, aligns with Lemma 4)
4) Bondy–Chvátal closure theorem (statement and short justification)
- Statement: Let cl(G) be obtained by repeatedly adding nonedges uv with deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n until no such pair remains. Then G is Hamiltonian iff cl(G) is Hamiltonian.
- Justification sketch: Each single addition preserves Hamiltonicity equivalence by Lemma 4; hence any maximal sequence yields a final graph H with G Hamiltonian iff H is. The closure is unique (order‑independent) by the monotonicity of the rule (adding eligible edges cannot invalidate eligibility of others). Thus H = cl(G). ∎
- Why useful: Conceptual unification; Dirac and Ore are immediate corollaries.

Examples and self‑checks
- Small n: For n = 3, δ ≥ 2 implies G = K_3, Hamiltonian. For n = 4, δ ≥ 2 includes C_4 and K_4−e; both are Hamiltonian, consistent with the theorem.

Obstacles and delicate points (none blocking)
- In Lemma 3, the inequality |A|+|B| ≤ (n−3)+1+1 counts the interior indices {2,…,n−2} with disjointness unless we already have the desired cycle, plus the endpoint‑adjacent indices i = 1 (for A only) and i = n − 1 (for B only). This is correct but easy to miscount; retaining this explicit partition in outputs.md avoids confusion.

Next steps (for outputs.md)
- Add as Corollaries: (i) Ore’s theorem, (ii) common‑neighbor and diameter ≤ 2 lemmas. These are short and self‑contained.
- Optionally add the Bondy–Chvátal closure theorem statement with a brief justification referencing Lemma 4.
- If desired, include a short remark on constructing a Hamiltonian cycle: traverse the closure additions; if the final Hamiltonian cycle uses a newly added edge uv, remove it to get a Hamiltonian path in the previous graph and apply the path‑closing lemma; iterate backward to G.

## Audit of output.md (correctness and small refinements)
- The curated proof establishes Dirac’s theorem via the Bondy–Chvátal single‑edge step and is logically sound. The path‑closing lemma’s indexing and the equivalence step (Lemma 4) are correct and sufficient for the iterative closure to K_n under δ ≥ n/2.
- Proposition 1 (connectivity): The final sentence can be made explicit: if the smallest component has size s ≥ n/2+1 and there are ≥2 components, then two components together have at least 2s ≥ n+2 vertices, impossible. The argument as written is correct but could state “two components” more explicitly.
- Proposition 2 (2‑connectivity): The bound s ≤ ⌊(n−1)/2⌋ follows since the sum of component sizes of G−w is n−1 with at least two components. The current proof is fine.
- Lemma 3 (path‑closing): The counting inequality |A|+|B| ≤ n−1 under A∩B=∅ is accurate; the justification |A|=deg(u), |B|=deg(v) is correct because uv ∉ E and P is Hamiltonian. No gaps detected.

## New, small results to add (useful corollaries and generalizations)
1) Common neighbors and diameter under δ ≥ n/2
- Corollary (≥2 common neighbors): If δ(G) ≥ n/2 and u,v are nonadjacent, then |N(u)∩N(v)| ≥ 2.
  Proof: N(u), N(v) ⊆ V\{u,v}, so |N(u)∪N(v)| ≤ n−2. Hence |N(u)∩N(v)| = deg(u)+deg(v)−|N(u)∪N(v)| ≥ n−(n−2) = 2.
- Corollary (diameter ≤ 2): Under δ(G) ≥ n/2, any two vertices are adjacent or have a common neighbor, hence diam(G) ≤ 2. (This follows from the previous inequality with “≥1” as well.)

2) Ore’s theorem (record as a stand‑alone consequence of Lemma 4)
- Theorem (Ore): If for every nonadjacent u,v we have deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, then G is Hamiltonian.
  Proof: Enumerate all nonedges and add them one‑by‑one. At each step, Lemma 4 applies (the degree‑sum condition is measured in the current graph) and preserves Hamiltonicity equivalence. The final graph is K_n, which is Hamiltonian, so the original G is Hamiltonian.
  Why useful here: Dirac is an immediate corollary of Ore since δ ≥ n/2 implies every nonedge satisfies the Ore condition.

3) Full closure equivalence (Bondy–Chvátal) — compact statement and proof
- Theorem (Closure equivalence): Let cl(G) be obtained by iteratively adding nonedges uv with deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n until none remain. Then G is Hamiltonian iff cl(G) is Hamiltonian.
  Proof: Let G = G_0 ⊆ G_1 ⊆ … ⊆ G_m = cl(G), where each G_{i+1} = G_i + u_iv_i with deg_{G_i}(u_i)+deg_{G_i}(v_i) ≥ n. By Lemma 4 applied in G_i, G_i is Hamiltonian iff G_{i+1} is. Induct over i to conclude G is Hamiltonian iff cl(G) is.
  Why useful: This generalizes the Dirac and Ore arguments and matches the standard literature.

4) Constructive extraction of a Hamiltonian cycle (algorithmic note)
- Under δ ≥ n/2, closure reaches K_n. Fix any Hamiltonian cycle C_m in K_n (e.g., (1,2,…,n,1)). Traverse the added edges in reverse (from K_n back to G). If the current cycle uses the last added edge uv, delete uv to obtain a Hamiltonian path with endpoints u,v and apply the path‑closing lemma (in the previous graph) to replace it by a Hamiltonian cycle avoiding uv. If it doesn’t use uv, keep the cycle. This yields a Hamiltonian cycle in the original G. Each step is justified by Lemma 3.

## Examples/sanity checks (beyond those in output.md)
- Even n: K_{n/2,n/2} has δ = n/2 and is Hamiltonian; closure adds all intra‑part edges (each pair has degree‑sum n), ending at K_n, consistent with equivalence.
- Small n: For n=3, δ ≥ 2 gives K_3. For n=4, δ ≥ 2 covers C_4 and K_{2,2}, both Hamiltonian.

## Next steps for outputs.md
- Optionally append: (i) the “≥2 common neighbors” and “diameter ≤ 2” corollaries; (ii) Ore’s theorem with the short proof above; (iii) the Bondy–Chvátal closure equivalence statement (compact proof via Lemma 4). These are short and strengthen the exposition without altering the main Dirac proof.

## round-0001 — model summary — 2025-08-26T19:16:25.933680Z
In this round, we explored Dirac's Theorem, which states that a graph with at least 3 vertices is Hamiltonian if every vertex has a degree of at least n/2. However, we identified limitations, including counterexamples where graphs with minimum degree ≥ n/2 are not Hamiltonian, particularly in disconnected graphs. A special case for n=3 was validated, but it does not generalize. The general approach to constructing Hamiltonian cycles from graphs with minimum degree ≥ n/2 requires further exploration and lacks rigor.

## round-0001 — model summary — 2025-08-27T08:24:41.955915Z
Round 0001 fixes the setting (finite, simple, undirected graphs, n ≥ 3) and corrects the earlier misconception: δ(G) ≥ n/2 forces connectivity and in fact 2‑connectivity, so disconnected/cut‑vertex counterexamples are impossible. The prover records and (mostly) proves standard lemmas: connectivity from δ ≥ n/2; sharpness via K_{n/2−1, n/2+1} (or the odd‑n variant); a longest‑path lower bound (there is a path of length ≥ δ+1); and the Bondy–Chvátal single‑edge closure step (if uv is a nonedge with deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, then adding uv preserves Hamiltonicity) proved by a pigeonhole argument along a Hamiltonian path. Iterating the closure yields K_n under δ ≥ n/2, hence Dirac's theorem follows. The verifier flags and corrects one minor error about K_{n/2,n/2} closure. Remaining work is a full formal writeup of the iterative closure (or an optional Ore/longest‑path alternative) and a final LaTeXized proof.

## round-0001 — model summary — 2025-08-27T09:25:35.963680Z
In Round 0001, the focus was on establishing the conditions under which a simple, undirected graph with minimum degree δ(G) ≥ n/2 is Hamiltonian, as per Dirac's theorem. Key lemmas were developed, including connectivity implications, sharpness of the degree bound, and a longest path lower bound. The Bondy–Chvátal closure theorem was introduced as a critical step in proving Hamiltonicity, with a corollary linking it to Dirac's theorem. Special cases were examined, including the case of a cycle of length n−1, and counterexamples were explored to reinforce the established conditions. The round concluded with a plan for a full formal writeup and potential alternative proofs.

## round-0001 — model summary — 2025-08-27T14:39:26.750327Z
Round summary: Prover-01 and Prover-02 supply a complete closure-based proof plan for Dirac's theorem (n = |V| ≥ 3). Key steps: prove the path-closing lemma for a Hamiltonian path P with endpoints u,v (if deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n then P closes to a Hamiltonian cycle); deduce the single-edge closure equivalence (adding a nonedge uv with deg-sum ≥ n preserves Hamiltonicity both ways); iterate this safe addition under δ(G) ≥ n/2 to obtain K_n and conclude G is Hamiltonian. Both provers also record supporting lemmas (δ ≥ n/2 implies connected and 2‑connected), small technical checks on indexing/endpoints, and sharpness examples (K_{k−1,k+1} and K_{k,k+1}). Optional alternative routes (Ore or Pósa) are noted. outputs.md was not produced in this round; the Verifier reports success on the submitted summaries.

## round-0002 — model summary — 2025-08-27T14:45:36.487904Z
The round audits and micro‑refinements confirm the Dirac proof via Bondy–Chvátal closure is correct and complete for n≥3. Key lemmas (path‑closing, single‑edge closure equivalence) and the iterative augmentation to K_n are logically sound; degrees increase monotonically so eligibility persists. Minor clarity edits were suggested (make the “two components” sentence explicit in Prop.1, state deg‑sums are measured in G in Lemma 4, and keep the indexing in Lemma 3 explicit). Several short, useful corollaries were recommended for outputs.md: Ore’s theorem, the Bondy–Chvátal closure equivalence, the ≥2 common‑neighbors fact and diam(G) ≤ 2 under δ ≥ n/2, and a constructive algorithm to extract a Hamiltonian cycle by reversing the closure. Sanity‑check examples (K_{n/2,n/2}, small n) validate sharpness. Verifier: success. Citations: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json, verifier output.

Refinements and recorded tools for the closure route to Dirac

Setting: Finite, simple, undirected graphs on n = |V(G)| ≥ 3; δ(G) is minimum degree. We index Hamiltonian paths as P = x_0,x_1,…,x_{n−1} with u = x_0 and v = x_{n−1}.

Path-closing lemma (indexing we will use): If P is Hamiltonian and deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, then G has a Hamiltonian cycle. If uv ∈ E, the path closes immediately. Otherwise define
- A = { i ∈ {1,…,n−2} : u is adjacent to x_i },
- B = { i ∈ {2,…,n−1} : v is adjacent to x_{i−1} }.
Because P spans all vertices and uv ∉ E, |A| = deg(u) and |B| = deg(v). For i ∈ {2,…,n−2}, the simultaneous occurrence i ∈ A ∩ B yields the Hamiltonian cycle u−x_i−…−v−x_{i−1}−…−u. If A ∩ B = ∅, then |A|+|B| ≤ (n−3) + 1 + 1 = n−1, contradicting deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n. Hence A ∩ B ≠ ∅ and the cycle exists.

Single-edge closure equivalence: If uv ∉ E(G) with deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, then G is Hamiltonian iff G+uv is Hamiltonian. The backward direction uses the path-closing lemma after removing uv from a Hamiltonian cycle in G+uv.

Closure under δ ≥ n/2: If δ(G) ≥ n/2, every nonedge uv satisfies deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n. Adding all such nonedges (degrees only increase) yields K_n. By the equivalence at each step, Hamiltonicity is preserved.

Immediate consequences recorded
- Connectivity: δ ≥ n/2 ⇒ G is connected.
- 2-connectivity: δ ≥ n/2 ⇒ G has no cut-vertex.
- Common neighbors under δ ≥ n/2: For nonadjacent u,v, |N(u)∪N(v)| ≤ n−2, so |N(u)∩N(v)| ≥ deg(u)+deg(v) − (n−2) ≥ 2. Thus any nonadjacent pair has at least two common neighbors. Useful for rotation–extension arguments.

Sharpness: For even n=2k, K_{k−1,k+1} has δ = k−1 = n/2−1 and is non-Hamiltonian (bipartite imbalance). For odd n=2k+1, K_{k,k+1} has δ = k = ⌊n/2⌋ and is non-Hamiltonian (all cycles even). Thus Dirac’s bound can’t be lowered.

What’s next
- Add Ore’s theorem as a corollary of the single-edge equivalence (no full closure needed).
- Prove the full Bondy–Chvátal closure theorem cl(G) is Hamiltonian iff G is.
- Optional: Pancyclicity strengthening (Bondy) under δ ≥ n/2, and a constructive extraction of a Hamiltonian cycle via closure plus the path-closing lemma.
Additions appended to outputs (all rigorously proven there)

- Corollary (two common neighbors under δ ≥ n/2): For any nonadjacent u, v we have |N(u) ∩ N(v)| ≥ 2. Proof idea: N(u), N(v) ⊆ V \ {u, v}, so |N(u) ∪ N(v)| ≤ n − 2; inclusion–exclusion with deg(u) + deg(v) ≥ n gives |N(u) ∩ N(v)| ≥ 2.
- Corollary (diameter ≤ 2 under δ ≥ n/2): Every pair of vertices is either adjacent or has a common neighbor; thus diam(G) ≤ 2.
- Ore’s theorem via Lemma 4: If every nonadjacent pair satisfies deg(u) + deg(v) ≥ n in G, then iteratively adding any nonedge uv preserves Hamiltonicity equivalence (degrees only increase), reaching K_n and implying G is Hamiltonian.
- Bondy–Chvátal closure equivalence: Define Φ(H) by adding all nonedges with current degree sum ≥ n. Iterating Φ from G stabilizes at cl(G). Monotonicity of Φ gives order-independence (any maximal one-by-one process yields the same cl(G)) and provides a chain from G to cl(G) adding one eligible edge at a time; applying Lemma 4 at each step gives G Hamiltonian iff cl(G) Hamiltonian.

Algorithmic note (constructing a Hamiltonian cycle under δ ≥ n/2)
- Compute the closure (here it is K_n) while recording the added edges in order.
- Start with any Hamiltonian cycle in K_n.
- Traverse the added edges in reverse: if the current cycle uses the last added edge uv, delete uv to get a Hamiltonian u–v path in the previous graph and re-close it by the path-closing lemma; otherwise keep the cycle. Invariants: at each step you maintain a Hamiltonian cycle in the current graph. This yields a Hamiltonian cycle in the original G.

Sanity checks
- Threshold examples K_{n/2,n/2} (even n) and small n (n = 3, 4) behave as expected under the closure and the corollaries.

Next objectives
- Prove Bondy’s pancyclicity strengthening (either closure-based or via rotation–extension), and, if included, give sharp exceptions.
- Optional: quantify the complexity of the constructive procedure; record a brief pseudocode and complexity O(n^2)–O(n^3) depending on data structures.

Definitions and standing assumptions
- Graphs are finite, simple, undirected. Let n = |V(G)| ≥ 3. Write δ(G) for the minimum degree. A Hamiltonian path/cycle is a path/cycle on all n vertices.

Proposition 1 (Connectivity). If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then G is connected.
Proof. Suppose G is disconnected, and let C be a smallest component with |C| = s. Any v ∈ C has deg(v) ≤ s−1. If s ≤ n/2 then deg(v) ≤ n/2−1 < n/2, contradicting δ(G) ≥ n/2. Hence s ≥ n/2+1, but then the union of two components already has more than n vertices, a contradiction. ∎

Proposition 2 (2-connectivity). If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then G has no cut-vertex.
Proof. Suppose w is a cut-vertex. Let the components of G−w be H_1,…,H_t with t ≥ 2, and set s = min_i |V(H_i)|. For any x in a smallest component, x has neighbors only within that component and possibly w, so deg(x) ≤ (s−1)+1 = s. Since s ≤ (n−1)/2, we get deg(x) ≤ (n−1)/2 < n/2, contradicting δ(G) ≥ n/2. ∎

Lemma 3 (Path-closing). Let P = x_0,x_1,…,x_{n−1} be a Hamiltonian path in G with endpoints u = x_0 and v = x_{n−1}. If deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, then G has a Hamiltonian cycle.
Proof. If uv ∈ E(G), adding uv closes P into a Hamiltonian cycle. Assume uv ∉ E(G). Define
A = { i ∈ {1,…,n−2} : u is adjacent to x_i },
B = { i ∈ {2,…,n−1} : v is adjacent to x_{i−1} }.
Because P spans all vertices and uv ∉ E(G), every neighbor of u (resp. v) lies among x_1,…,x_{n−2}, so |A| = deg(u) and |B| = deg(v). For i ∈ {2,…,n−2}, if both u∼x_i and v∼x_{i−1} hold (i.e., i ∈ A ∩ B), then the cycle
u, x_i, x_{i+1}, …, x_{n−1}(=v), x_{i−1}, x_{i−2}, …, x_0(=u)
uses edges of P plus the two chords and spans all vertices. If A ∩ B = ∅, then among the (n−3) indices i ∈ {2,…,n−2} at most one of i ∈ A or i ∈ B can occur each time, and additionally index 1 can contribute only to A and index n−1 only to B. Hence |A|+|B| ≤ (n−3)+1+1 = n−1, contradicting deg(u)+deg(v) = |A|+|B| ≥ n. Therefore A ∩ B ≠ ∅ and the Hamiltonian cycle exists. ∎

Lemma 4 (Single-edge closure equivalence). Let uv ∉ E(G) with deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, and let G′ = G + uv. Then G is Hamiltonian if and only if G′ is Hamiltonian.
Proof. If G is Hamiltonian then so is the supergraph G′. Conversely, suppose G′ has a Hamiltonian cycle. If the cycle avoids uv, it is a Hamiltonian cycle of G. If it uses uv, then deleting uv yields a Hamiltonian path in G with endpoints u and v; apply Lemma 3 to conclude that G is Hamiltonian. ∎

Lemma 5 (Closure to K_n under δ ≥ n/2). If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then for every nonedge {u,v} we have deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n. Iteratively adding all such nonedges yields K_n.
Proof. Under δ(G) ≥ n/2, any two vertices satisfy deg(u) ≥ n/2 and deg(v) ≥ n/2, so deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n. Adding a nonedge can only increase degrees, so the degree-sum condition persists for remaining nonedges. After finitely many additions, all nonedges are added and the resulting graph is K_n. ∎

Theorem 6 (Dirac’s theorem). Let G be a graph on n ≥ 3 vertices. If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then G is Hamiltonian.
Proof. By Lemma 5 we may add all nonedges with degree-sum at least n to obtain K_n. By Lemma 4, Hamiltonicity is preserved (equivalently) at each addition, so G is Hamiltonian if and only if K_n is. Since K_n has a Hamiltonian cycle for n ≥ 3, G is Hamiltonian. ∎

Proposition 7 (Sharpness of the bound). The threshold n/2 cannot be lowered.
(a) For even n = 2k, the graph K_{k−1, k+1} has δ = k−1 = n/2−1 and is not Hamiltonian (a Hamiltonian cycle in a bipartite graph must alternate evenly, impossible with parts of different sizes).
(b) For odd n = 2k+1, the graph K_{k, k+1} has δ = k = ⌊n/2⌋ and is not Hamiltonian (all cycles in bipartite graphs are even, but n is odd).
Thus the bound n/2 is best possible up to rounding. ∎
Corollary 8 (Two common neighbors under δ ≥ n/2). Let G be a graph on n ≥ 3 vertices with δ(G) ≥ n/2. If u and v are nonadjacent, then |N(u) ∩ N(v)| ≥ 2.
Proof. Since N(u), N(v) ⊆ V(G) \ {u, v}, we have |N(u) ∪ N(v)| ≤ n − 2. Hence
|N(u) ∩ N(v)| = deg(u) + deg(v) − |N(u) ∪ N(v)| ≥ n − (n − 2) = 2. ∎

Corollary 9 (Diameter ≤ 2 under δ ≥ n/2). If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then diam(G) ≤ 2.
Proof. For any two vertices u, v, either uv ∈ E(G), giving distance 1, or uv ∉ E(G), in which case by Corollary 8 they share a neighbor and have distance 2. ∎

Theorem 10 (Ore’s theorem). Let G be a graph on n ≥ 3 vertices such that for every nonadjacent pair u, v we have deg(u) + deg(v) ≥ n. Then G is Hamiltonian.
Proof. Enumerate the nonedges of G arbitrarily and add them one by one. Degrees only increase, so at each step the current nonedge uv being added satisfies deg(u) + deg(v) ≥ n in the current graph. By Lemma 4, each single addition preserves Hamiltonicity equivalence. The final graph is K_n, which is Hamiltonian; thus the original G is Hamiltonian. ∎

Theorem 11 (Bondy–Chvátal closure equivalence). Let G be a graph on n ≥ 3 vertices. Define the operator Φ by
Φ(H) = H + { uv ∉ E(H) : deg_H(u) + deg_H(v) ≥ n }.
Let cl(G) = Φ^m(G) for any m large enough that Φ^m(G) = Φ^{m+1}(G) (this stabilization occurs since the edge set is finite). Then G is Hamiltonian if and only if cl(G) is Hamiltonian. Moreover, cl(G) is the unique graph obtainable from G by repeatedly adding nonedges uv with deg(current u) + deg(current v) ≥ n until none remain, independent of the order of additions.
Proof. Uniqueness/order-independence: Consider the chain H_0 = G, H_{t+1} = Φ(H_t). Since |E| is finite, H_t stabilizes at some m with H_m = Φ(H_m); set cl(G) = H_m. Let G = G_0 ⊂ G_1 ⊂ ··· ⊂ G_s = H be any maximal chain obtained by adding one eligible nonedge at each step, stopping when no such pair remains. First, by monotonicity of Φ we have G_i ⊆ Φ^i(G) for all i (induction: if G_i ⊆ Φ^i(G), then G_{i+1} ⊆ Φ(G_i) ⊆ Φ(Φ^i(G)) = Φ^{i+1}(G)). Hence H ⊆ Φ^s(G) ⊆ cl(G). Conversely, since H has no eligible nonedges, Φ(H) = H; thus for all k, Φ^k(G) ⊆ Φ^k(H) = H by monotonicity, and in particular cl(G) ⊆ H. Therefore H = cl(G), proving order-independence and uniqueness.
Equivalence of Hamiltonicity: At each stage, the set Φ(H_t) \ E(H_t) consists of nonedges uv whose degree sums are ≥ n in H_t. Enumerating these edges one by one yields a chain of single-edge additions from H_t to H_{t+1}; concatenating over t = 0, 1, …, m − 1 gives a chain from G to cl(G) where each added edge satisfies the degree-sum condition in the current graph. By Lemma 4, each addition preserves Hamiltonicity equivalence; composing these equivalences yields that G is Hamiltonian iff cl(G) is. ∎

=== round-0002/verifier.feedback.md ===
Both prover reports are careful and largely aligned. I rechecked the current outputs.md line by line:

- Propositions 1 and 2 (connectivity and 2-connectivity) are correct. The end of Prop. 1 could be made slightly more explicit (why “two components” force > n vertices), but it is logically fine: if the smallest component has size s ≥ n/2 + 1 and there are ≥ 2 components, then two components contribute at least 2s ≥ n + 2 vertices, impossible.
- Lemma 3 (path-closing) is sound. The disjointness accounting over indices {2,…,n−2} and the treatment of endpoints i = 1 and i = n − 1 correctly yield |A| + |B| ≤ n − 1 under A ∩ B = ∅, contradicting deg(u) + deg(v) ≥ n. The definitions of A and B explicitly avoid counting uv and ensure |A| = deg(u), |B| = deg(v).
- Lemma 4 (single-edge closure equivalence) is used with degree sums measured in the current graph at each step of augmentation; the statement already uses degrees in G for one step, which is exactly what is needed for iterative application.
- Lemma 5 and Theorem 6 (Dirac) are standard and correct. Under δ ≥ n/2 all nonedges are immediately eligible; degrees can only increase, so the augmentation proceeds to K_n.
- Proposition 7 (sharpness) is correct for both even and odd n.

Added value and curation choices:
- The short corollaries proposed by both provers (≥2 common neighbors; diameter ≤ 2) are correct, short, and useful; I recommend appending them to outputs.md.
- Ore’s theorem follows immediately from Lemma 4 and deserves inclusion; this also shows Dirac is an immediate corollary of Ore.
- The Bondy–Chvátal closure equivalence is the conceptual core. I am appending a compact, fully rigorous statement/proof that also establishes uniqueness/order-independence of the closure via a monotone-operator argument and then derives the Hamiltonicity equivalence by chaining Lemma 4.

Promising next steps:
- With the closure theorem in place, an ideal next target is Bondy’s pancyclicity strengthening: if δ ≥ n/2, then G is pancyclic unless G ≅ K_{n/2,n/2}. This requires either closure-based arguments or rotation–extension with careful extremal analysis.
- For algorithms, formalize the reverse-closure construction of a Hamiltonian cycle (already sketched in the notes) with a complexity bound and a precise invariant.
- Optional: Record and prove the order-independence of closure separately (now included within the closure theorem’s proof), and add a concise self-contained treatment of small-n boundary cases.

No false statements were found in the current outputs.md; the appended results below are rigorous and self-contained.

Refinements and recorded tools for the closure route to Dirac

Setting: Finite, simple, undirected graphs on n = |V(G)| ≥ 3; δ(G) is minimum degree. We index Hamiltonian paths as P = x_0,x_1,…,x_{n−1} with u = x_0 and v = x_{n−1}.

Path-closing lemma (indexing we will use): If P is Hamiltonian and deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, then G has a Hamiltonian cycle. If uv ∈ E, the path closes immediately. Otherwise define
- A = { i ∈ {1,…,n−2} : u is adjacent to x_i },
- B = { i ∈ {2,…,n−1} : v is adjacent to x_{i−1} }.
Because P spans all vertices and uv ∉ E, |A| = deg(u) and |B| = deg(v). For i ∈ {2,…,n−2}, the simultaneous occurrence i ∈ A ∩ B yields the Hamiltonian cycle u−x_i−…−v−x_{i−1}−…−u. If A ∩ B = ∅, then |A|+|B| ≤ (n−3) + 1 + 1 = n−1, contradicting deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n. Hence A ∩ B ≠ ∅ and the cycle exists.

Single-edge closure equivalence: If uv ∉ E(G) with deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, then G is Hamiltonian iff G+uv is Hamiltonian. The backward direction uses the path-closing lemma after removing uv from a Hamiltonian cycle in G+uv.

Closure under δ ≥ n/2: If δ(G) ≥ n/2, every nonedge uv satisfies deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n. Adding all such nonedges (degrees only increase) yields K_n. By the equivalence at each step, Hamiltonicity is preserved.

Immediate consequences recorded
- Connectivity: δ ≥ n/2 ⇒ G is connected.
- 2-connectivity: δ ≥ n/2 ⇒ G has no cut-vertex.
- Common neighbors under δ ≥ n/2: For nonadjacent u,v, |N(u)∪N(v)| ≤ n−2, so |N(u)∩N(v)| ≥ deg(u)+deg(v) − (n−2) ≥ 2. Thus any nonadjacent pair has at least two common neighbors. Useful for rotation–extension arguments.

Sharpness: For even n=2k, K_{k−1,k+1} has δ = k−1 = n/2−1 and is non-Hamiltonian (bipartite imbalance). For odd n=2k+1, K_{k,k+1} has δ = k = ⌊n/2⌋ and is non-Hamiltonian (all cycles even). Thus Dirac’s bound can’t be lowered.

- Corollary (diameter ≤ 2 under δ ≥ n/2): Every pair of vertices is either adjacent or has a common neighbor; thus diam(G) ≤ 2.

Definitions and standing assumptions
- Graphs are finite, simple, undirected. Let n = |V(G)| ≥ 3. Write δ(G) for the minimum degree. A Hamiltonian path/cycle is a path/cycle on all n vertices.

Proposition 1 (Connectivity). If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then G is connected.
Proof. Suppose G is disconnected, and let C be a smallest component with |C| = s. Any v ∈ C has deg(v) ≤ s−1. If s ≤ n/2 then deg(v) ≤ n/2−1 < n/2, contradicting δ(G) ≥ n/2. Hence s ≥ n/2+1, but then the union of two components already has more than n vertices, a contradiction. ∎

Proposition 2 (2-connectivity). If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then G has no cut-vertex.
Proof. Suppose w is a cut-vertex. Let the components of G−w be H_1,…,H_t with t ≥ 2, and set s = min_i |V(H_i)|. For any x in a smallest component, x has neighbors only within that component and possibly w, so deg(x) ≤ (s−1)+1 = s. Since s ≤ (n−1)/2, we get deg(x) ≤ (n−1)/2 < n/2, contradicting δ(G) ≥ n/2. ∎

Lemma 3 (Path-closing). Let P = x_0,x_1,…,x_{n−1} be a Hamiltonian path in G with endpoints u = x_0 and v = x_{n−1}. If deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, then G has a Hamiltonian cycle.
Proof. If uv ∈ E(G), adding uv closes P into a Hamiltonian cycle. Assume uv ∉ E(G). Define
A = { i ∈ {1,…,n−2} : u is adjacent to x_i },
B = { i ∈ {2,…,n−1} : v is adjacent to x_{i−1} }.
Because P spans all vertices and uv ∉ E(G), every neighbor of u (resp. v) lies among x_1,…,x_{n−2}, so |A| = deg(u) and |B| = deg(v). For i ∈ {2,…,n−2}, if both u∼x_i and v∼x_{i−1} hold (i.e., i ∈ A ∩ B), then the cycle
u, x_i, x_{i+1}, …, x_{n−1}(=v), x_{i−1}, x_{i−2}, …, x_0(=u)
uses edges of P plus the two chords and spans all vertices. If A ∩ B = ∅, then among the (n−3) indices i ∈ {2,…,n−2} at most one of i ∈ A or i ∈ B can occur each time, and additionally index 1 can contribute only to A and index n−1 only to B. Hence |A|+|B| ≤ (n−3)+1+1 = n−1, contradicting deg(u)+deg(v) = |A|+|B| ≥ n. Therefore A ∩ B ≠ ∅ and the Hamiltonian cycle exists. ∎

Lemma 4 (Single-edge closure equivalence). Let uv ∉ E(G) with deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, and let G′ = G + uv. Then G is Hamiltonian if and only if G′ is Hamiltonian.
Proof. If G is Hamiltonian then so is the supergraph G′. Conversely, suppose G′ has a Hamiltonian cycle. If the cycle avoids uv, it is a Hamiltonian cycle of G. If it uses uv, then deleting uv yields a Hamiltonian path in G with endpoints u and v; apply Lemma 3 to conclude that G is Hamiltonian. ∎

Lemma 5 (Closure to K_n under δ ≥ n/2). If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then for every nonedge {u,v} we have deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n. Iteratively adding all such nonedges yields K_n.
Proof. Under δ(G) ≥ n/2, any two vertices satisfy deg(u) ≥ n/2 and deg(v) ≥ n/2, so deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n. Adding a nonedge can only increase degrees, so the degree-sum condition persists for remaining nonedges. After finitely many additions, all nonedges are added and the resulting graph is K_n. ∎

Theorem 6 (Dirac’s theorem). Let G be a graph on n ≥ 3 vertices. If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then G is Hamiltonian.
Proof. By Lemma 5 we may add all nonedges with degree-sum at least n to obtain K_n. By Lemma 4, Hamiltonicity is preserved (equivalently) at each addition, so G is Hamiltonian if and only if K_n is. Since K_n has a Hamiltonian cycle for n ≥ 3, G is Hamiltonian. ∎

Proposition 7 (Sharpness of the bound). The threshold n/2 cannot be lowered.
(a) For even n = 2k, the graph K_{k−1, k+1} has δ = k−1 = n/2−1 and is not Hamiltonian (a Hamiltonian cycle in a bipartite graph must alternate evenly, impossible with parts of different sizes).
(b) For odd n = 2k+1, the graph K_{k, k+1} has δ = k = ⌊n/2⌋ and is not Hamiltonian (all cycles in bipartite graphs are even, but n is odd).
Thus the bound n/2 is best possible up to rounding. ∎
Corollary 8 (Two common neighbors under δ ≥ n/2). Let G be a graph on n ≥ 3 vertices with δ(G) ≥ n/2. If u and v are nonadjacent, then |N(u) ∩ N(v)| ≥ 2.
Proof. Since N(u), N(v) ⊆ V(G) \ {u, v}, we have |N(u) ∪ N(v)| ≤ n − 2. Hence
|N(u) ∩ N(v)| = deg(u) + deg(v) − |N(u) ∪ N(v)| ≥ n − (n − 2) = 2. ∎

Corollary 9 (Diameter ≤ 2 under δ ≥ n/2). If δ(G) ≥ n/2, then diam(G) ≤ 2.
Proof. For any two vertices u, v, either uv ∈ E(G), giving distance 1, or uv ∉ E(G), in which case by Corollary 8 they share a neighbor and have distance 2. ∎

Theorem 10 (Ore’s theorem). Let G be a graph on n ≥ 3 vertices such that for every nonadjacent pair u, v we have deg(u) + deg(v) ≥ n. Then G is Hamiltonian.
Proof. Enumerate the nonedges of G arbitrarily and add them one by one. Degrees only increase, so at each step the current nonedge uv being added satisfies deg(u) + deg(v) ≥ n in the current graph. By Lemma 4, each single addition preserves Hamiltonicity equivalence. The final graph is K_n, which is Hamiltonian; thus the original G is Hamiltonian. ∎

Theorem 11 (Bondy–Chvátal closure equivalence). Let G be a graph on n ≥ 3 vertices. Define the operator Φ by
Φ(H) = H + { uv ∉ E(H) : deg_H(u) + deg_H(v) ≥ n }.
Let cl(G) = Φ^m(G) for any m large enough that Φ^m(G) = Φ^{m+1}(G) (this stabilization occurs since the edge set is finite). Then G is Hamiltonian if and only if cl(G) is Hamiltonian. Moreover, cl(G) is the unique graph obtainable from G by repeatedly adding nonedges uv with deg(current u) + deg(current v) ≥ n until none remain, independent of the order of additions.
Proof. Uniqueness/order-independence: Consider the chain H_0 = G, H_{t+1} = Φ(H_t). Since |E| is finite, H_t stabilizes at some m with H_m = Φ(H_m); set cl(G) = H_m. Let G = G_0 ⊂ G_1 ⊂ ··· ⊂ G_s = H be any maximal chain obtained by adding one eligible nonedge at each step, stopping when no such pair remains. First, by monotonicity of Φ we have G_i ⊆ Φ^i(G) for all i (induction: if G_i ⊆ Φ^i(G), then G_{i+1} ⊆ Φ(G_i) ⊆ Φ(Φ^i(G)) = Φ^{i+1}(G)). Hence H ⊆ Φ^s(G) ⊆ cl(G). Conversely, since H has no eligible nonedges, Φ(H) = H; thus for all k, Φ^k(G) ⊆ Φ^k(H) = H by monotonicity, and in particular cl(G) ⊆ H. Therefore H = cl(G), proving order-independence and uniqueness.
Equivalence of Hamiltonicity: At each stage, the set Φ(H_t) \ E(H_t) consists of nonedges uv whose degree sums are ≥ n in H_t. Enumerating these edges one by one yields a chain of single-edge additions from H_t to H_{t+1}; concatenating over t = 0, 1, …, m − 1 gives a chain from G to cl(G) where each added edge satisfies the degree-sum condition in the current graph. By Lemma 4, each addition preserves Hamiltonicity equivalence; composing these equivalences yields that G is Hamiltonian iff cl(G) is. ∎
