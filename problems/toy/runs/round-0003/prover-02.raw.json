Lemma 3 (path-closing), Lemma 4 (single-edge closure equivalence), Lemma 5 (iterative augmentation), and Theorem 6 (Dirac) are logically tight. The added corollaries (two common neighbors; diameter ≤ 2), Ore’s theorem, and the Bondy–Chvátal closure equivalence are also correct as stated and proved.\\n- Proposition 1 (connectivity): The final sentence could be made more explicit. Let s be the size of the smallest component and assume s ≥ n/2 + 1. Since there is another component and by minimality all components have size ≥ s, pick any other component C′; then |C| + |C′| ≥ 2s > n, contradiction. (Equivalently, if there are exactly two components, n − s ≥ s must hold by minimality, forcing s ≤ n/2; contradiction to s ≥ n/2 + 1.) The current proof hints at this but does not state “the other component has size ≥ s by minimality.”\\n- Lemma 3 (path-closing): The indexing and counting are sound. A small clarity note: explicitly mention that B indexes neighbors of v via i ↦ i − 1, so |B| = deg(v); this is already indicated but worth one explicit sentence in outputs.md.\\n- Theorem 11 (closure equivalence): The monotonicity and order-independence arguments are correct. The decomposition of Φ-steps into single-edge additions is valid since eligibility persists under degree increases.\\n\\n## New, small results and why useful\\n1) Lemma (Triangle or balanced bipartite under Dirac). Let G be on n ≥ 3 vertices with δ(G) ≥ n/2. Then either G contains a triangle, or n is even and G ≅ K_{n/2,n/2}.\\n- Proof: If G is triangle-free, Mantel’s theorem gives e(G) ≤ ⌊n^2/4⌋. But e(G) ≥ nδ(G)/2 ≥ n(n/2)/2 = n^2/4, hence e(G) = n^2/4 and G attains Mantel’s extremal case, so G ≅ K_{⌊n/2⌋, ⌈n/2⌉}. Under δ ≥ n/2 this forces n even and δ = n/2, hence G ≅ K_{n/2,n/2}. Otherwise G has a triangle. ∎\\n- Why useful: This is a first structural dichotomy toward Bondy’s pancyclicity strengthening (Dirac graphs are pancyclic unless G ≅ K_{n/2,n/2}). It also supplies a quick certificate of non-bipartiteness for most Dirac graphs.\\n\\n2) Worked example validating Lemma 3 (path-closing) on a tight instance.\\n- Let G = K_4 − x_0x_3 (the “diamond”), n = 4. Take P = x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3 with u = x_0, v = x_3. Here deg(u) = deg(v) = 2 and uv ∉ E(G), so deg(u) + deg(v) = 4 = n. Compute A = {i ∈ {1,2} : u ∼ x_i} = {1,2}; B = {i ∈ {2,3} : v ∼ x_{i−1}} = {2,3}. Then A ∩ B contains i = 2, providing the Hamiltonian cycle x_0, x_2, x_3, x_1, x_0 as in Lemma 3. This illustrates the indexing and the closing mechanism at the threshold.\\n\\n3) Algorithmic note (constructing a Hamiltonian cycle under δ ≥ n/2)\\n- Idea: Use the closure chain and reverse it, maintaining a Hamiltonian cycle at each step.\\n- Outline:\\n  1) Build a sequence G = G_0 ⊆ G_1 ⊆ … ⊆ G_m = K_n where each G_{i+1} = G_i + u_iv_i with deg_{G_i}(u_i) + deg_{G_i}(v_i) ≥ n (existence by Lemma 5).\\n  2) Pick any Hamiltonian cycle C_m in K_n (e.g., 1–2–…–n–1).\\n  3) For i = m − 1 down to 0: if C_{i+1} uses u_iv_i, delete that edge to get a Hamiltonian u_i–v_i path in G_{i+1}; by Lemma 3 applied in G_i (note deg_{G_i}(u_i) + deg_{G_i}(v_i) ≥ n), reclose to a Hamiltonian cycle C_i in G_i avoiding u_iv_i. If C_{i+1} does not use u_iv_i, set C_i = C_{i+1}.\\n- Invariant: At each step we maintain a Hamiltonian cycle of the current graph. Complexity: O(n^2)–O(n^3) depending on data structures (closure computation O(n^2) nonedge checks; each step’s reclosure is O(n)).\\n- Why useful: Gives a constructive certificate and a concrete procedure implementable from the curated lemmas.\\n\\n## Examples and sanity checks\\n- C_4 (n = 4) has δ = 2 = n/2 and is Hamiltonian; the closure adds both diagonals (each nonedge has degree-sum 4), yielding K_4, consistent with Lemma 5 and Theorem 6.\\n- Balanced bipartite extremal: K_{n/2,n/2} (n even) has δ = n/2 and is Hamiltonian but not pancyclic (no odd cycles); it realizes equality in Corollary 8 with large common neighborhoods and matches Lemma (1) when triangle-free.\\n\\n## Obstacles and cautions\\n- Pancyclicity: The closure equivalence does not by itself preserve pancyclicity, so one cannot immediately lift pancyclic cycles from K_n back to G via Lemma 3. Bondy’s theorem on pancyclicity at e(G) ≥ n^2/4 addresses this; a careful proof requires additional arguments beyond the current toolkit.\\n- Equality m = n^2/4: There exist δ-regular Dirac graphs with δ = n/2 and e(G) = n^2/4 that are not bipartite; Mantel’s extremal characterization applies only under triangle-free assumption.\\n\\n## Next steps (suggested additions to outputs.md)\\n- Add Lemma (Triangle or balanced bipartite under Dirac) with the short Mantel-based proof above.\\n- Optionally add the constructive algorithm note with a brief invariant proof (as above) and a complexity remark.\\n- Plan a pancyclicity strengthening: Record Bondy’s theorem (1971): If G is Hamiltonian and e(G) ≥ n^2/4, then G is pancyclic unless G ≅ K_{n/2,n/2}; outline a route to adapt/curate a proof, using the triangle lemma and rotation–extension or Bondy–Chvátal techniques.\\n\"}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"auto","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"ProverOutput","schema_":{"properties":{"progress_md":{"description":"Append-only progress notes","title":"Progress Md","type":"string"}},"required":["progress_md"],"title":"ProverOutput","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":15939,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":13017,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":11392},"total_tokens":28956},"user":null,"store":true}
