These examples can help illustrate the theorem's applicability to a broader range of configurations.\n\n**Candidate lemmas:**\n- A lemma stating that any graph with minimum degree \\\\(\n\\\\) and a number of vertices \\\\(\n\\\\) must have a connected subgraph of size \\\\(\n/2\\\\) could be useful. This can help in proving that there are enough edges to potentially form a Hamiltonian cycle.\n- Another lemma might involve the connectivity and path extension properties in graphs, showing that under certain conditions, paths can be extended to form cycles.\n\n**Obstacles:**\n- One major obstacle is proving the theorem for graphs that are not obviously Hamiltonian, such as those with complex internal structures or irregular connectivity patterns.\n- Another challenge is ensuring that the conditions of Dirac's Theorem are met without exception, especially in edge cases or under specific configurations that might not have been fully considered.\n\n**Next moves:**\n- Conduct a detailed examination of the proof of Dirac's Theorem to understand its assumptions and limitations.\n- Use the candidate lemmas to explore more complex graph configurations, testing the theorem's applicability and searching for potential counterexamples.\n- Review literature for any exceptions to Dirac's Theorem or conditions under which the theorem might not hold, to ensure a comprehensive understanding of its scope and limitations.",
