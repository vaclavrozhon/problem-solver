Key lemmas — Lemma 3 (path-closing), Lemma 4 (single-edge closure equivalence), Lemma 5 (iteration to K_n) — and Theorem 6 (Dirac) were validated; Theorem 11 (Bondy–Chvátal closure) is monotone and order-independent. Minor clarity fixes were suggested for Proposition 1 and an explicit indexing remark in Lemma 3. Both provers proposed short, useful additions: a minimal-counterexample proof of Ore’s theorem (using Lemma 4), the corollary that any Hamiltonian path closes under δ ≥ n/2, perfect/near‑perfect matching corollaries, and an explicit reverse‑closure algorithm to construct a Hamiltonian cycle (O(n^2) time). Prover-02 added a Mantel-based dichotomy (triangle or K_{n/2,n/2}) helpful for pursuing pancyclicity; both auditors note that a full pancyclic strengthening requires additional nontrivial work. Sanity checks (K_{n/2,n/2}, C_4, tight bipartite examples) pass.
