Summary of audit and triage
- Current outputs.md is technically sound. The closure-based proof of Dirac’s theorem is complete, with Lemma 3 (path-closing) correctly indexed and counted, Lemma 4 (single-edge closure equivalence) correctly bridging cycles that use/exclude an added edge, Lemma 5 establishing that under δ ≥ n/2 every nonedge is eligible and closure reaches K_n, and Theorem 11 giving the full Bondy–Chvátal closure equivalence with a clean order-independence proof.
- Minor clarity point in Proposition 1 (connectivity): the last step implicitly uses minimality of the chosen component. It is helpful to state explicitly that in a disconnected graph there exists another component C′ with |C′| ≥ s by minimality; then 2s > n follows if s ≥ n/2 + 1.
- Ore’s theorem (Theorem 10) is proved via iterative single-edge additions using Lemma 4; this is correct. Prover 01’s minimal-counterexample proof is a nice alternative but redundant; we should record it in notes as an alternative proof sketch rather than duplicating the theorem.
- New low-risk additions worth appending to outputs.md: (i) the immediate corollary “closing any Hamiltonian path under δ ≥ n/2” (direct from Lemma 3); (ii) perfect matching (even n) and near-perfect matching (odd n) corollaries via alternating edges on a Hamiltonian cycle/path. These are short, fully rigorous consequences.
- Algorithmic extraction: Both provers suggest reversing closure. The invariant argument is correct, but the stated time bound O(n^2) is optimistic in the worst case; if we naively find the A∩B index at each reverse step, the runtime is O(t·n) with t = number of added edges = Θ(n^2) in worst cases (e.g., K_{n/2,n/2}), giving O(n^3). We can safely add an algorithmic proposition with O(n^3) worst-case time using an adjacency matrix; further optimization can be left as a note.
- Mantel-based dichotomy (triangle or balanced K_{n/2,n/2} under δ ≥ n/2) is correct when one invokes Mantel’s extremal characterization. This is a good structural lemma toward pancyclicity and should go into notes. I recommend not adding it to outputs unless we explicitly cite Mantel’s equality case or provide a proof sketch.

Concrete next steps
- Add to outputs: the Hamiltonian-path closing corollary; perfect/near-perfect matching corollaries; a careful algorithmic proposition with an O(n^3) bound and a brief invariant proof (reverse the eligible-edge chain and use Lemma 3 to eliminate dependence on each edge).
- In notes: record (a) the minimal-counterexample proof of Ore; (b) the triangle-or-balanced-bipartite lemma with a Mantel-based proof; (c) a worked example illustrating Lemma 3 on K_4 minus an edge; (d) plan for pancyclicity: reference Bondy’s theorem (1971) that Hamiltonian graphs with e ≥ n^2/4 are pancyclic unless K_{n/2,n/2}, and outline rotation–extension or closure-based approaches.
- Optional future targets: Dirac’s circumference bound c(G) ≥ min{n, 2δ} (requires a separate, nontrivial argument); pancyclic strengthening under δ ≥ n/2 with the standard exception K_{n/2,n/2}.
