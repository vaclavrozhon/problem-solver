  "feedback_md": "Summary of audit and triage\n- Current outputs.md is technically sound. The closure-based proof of Dirac\u2019s theorem is complete, with Lemma 3 (path-closing) correctly indexed and counted, Lemma 4 (single-edge closure equivalence) correctly bridging cycles that use/exclude an added edge, Lemma 5 establishing that under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 every nonedge is eligible and closure reaches K_n, and Theorem 11 giving the full Bondy\u2013Chv\u00e1tal closure equivalence with a clean order-independence proof.\n- Minor clarity point in Proposition 1 (connectivity): the last step implicitly uses minimality of the chosen component. It is helpful to state explicitly that in a disconnected graph there exists another component C\u2032 with |C\u2032| \u2265 s by minimality; then 2s > n follows if s \u2265 n/2 + 1.\n- Ore\u2019s theorem (Theorem 10) is proved via iterative single-edge additions using Lemma 4; this is correct. Prover 01\u2019s minimal-counterexample proof is a nice alternative but redundant; we should record it in notes as an alternative proof sketch rather than duplicating the theorem.\n- New low-risk additions worth appending to outputs.md: (i) the immediate corollary \u201cclosing any Hamiltonian path under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2\u201d (direct from Lemma 3); (ii) perfect matching (even n) and near-perfect matching (odd n) corollaries via alternating edges on a Hamiltonian cycle/path. These are short, fully rigorous consequences.\n- Algorithmic extraction: Both provers suggest reversing closure. The invariant argument is correct, but the stated time bound O(n^2) is optimistic in the worst case; if we naively find the A\u2229B index at each reverse step, the runtime is O(t\u00b7n) with t = number of added edges = \u0398(n^2) in worst cases (e.g., K_{n/2,n/2}), giving O(n^3). We can safely add an algorithmic proposition with O(n^3) worst-case time using an adjacency matrix; further optimization can be left as a note.\n- Mantel-based dichotomy (triangle or balanced K_{n/2,n/2} under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2) is correct when one invokes Mantel\u2019s extremal characterization. This is a good structural lemma toward pancyclicity and should go into notes. I recommend not adding it to outputs unless we explicitly cite Mantel\u2019s equality case or provide a proof sketch.\n\nConcrete next steps\n- Add to outputs: the Hamiltonian-path closing corollary; perfect/near-perfect matching corollaries; a careful algorithmic proposition with an O(n^3) bound and a brief invariant proof (reverse the eligible-edge chain and use Lemma 3 to eliminate dependence on each edge).\n- In notes: record (a) the minimal-counterexample proof of Ore; (b) the triangle-or-balanced-bipartite lemma with a Mantel-based proof; (c) a worked example illustrating Lemma 3 on K_4 minus an edge; (d) plan for pancyclicity: reference Bondy\u2019s theorem (1971) that Hamiltonian graphs with e \u2265 n^2/4 are pancyclic unless K_{n/2,n/2}, and outline rotation\u2013extension or closure-based approaches.\n- Optional future targets: Dirac\u2019s circumference bound c(G) \u2265 min{n, 2\u03b4} (requires a separate, nontrivial argument); pancyclic strengthening under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 with the standard exception K_{n/2,n/2}.\n",
  "new_notes_md": "Additions and clarifications (closure route to Dirac)\n\n- Clarification to Proposition 1 (connectivity). In the disconnected case pick a smallest component C with |C| = s. There is another component C\u2032, and by minimality |C\u2032| \u2265 s. If s \u2265 n/2 + 1 then |C| + |C\u2032| \u2265 2s > n, impossible. Hence s \u2264 n/2 and the degree bound forces a contradiction to \u03b4 \u2265 n/2.\n\n- Minimal-counterexample proof of Ore (alternative). Suppose G (on n \u2265 3) violates Ore\u2019s condition \u21d2 Hamiltonian and has the minimum number of edges among such counterexamples. Pick a nonedge uv; then G\u2032 = G + uv still satisfies Ore\u2019s condition (degrees do not decrease). By minimality, G\u2032 is Hamiltonian. If the Hamiltonian cycle of G\u2032 uses uv, delete uv to get a Hamiltonian uv-path in G and apply Lemma 3 (deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n) to re-close in G; if it avoids uv, it is a Hamiltonian cycle of G. Contradiction. Hence Ore holds.\n\n- Triangle or balanced bipartite under Dirac (structural lemma toward pancyclicity). If \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2 and G is triangle-free, then Mantel\u2019s theorem gives e(G) \u2264 \u230an^2/4\u230b while \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 implies e(G) \u2265 n\u03b4/2 \u2265 n^2/4. Thus e(G) = n^2/4 and G is an extremal Mantel graph, i.e., a complete bipartite K_{\u230an/2\u230b, \u2308n/2\u2309}. Under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 this forces n even and G \u2245 K_{n/2,n/2}. Otherwise, G contains a triangle. This dichotomy is the entry point to Bondy\u2019s pancyclicity strengthening.\n\n- Worked example for Lemma 3 (path-closing). Let G = K_4 \u2212 x_0x_3 (the diamond). Take P = x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3; u = x_0, v = x_3, deg(u) = deg(v) = 2, uv \u2209 E. Then A = {1,2}, B = {2,3}, so A \u2229 B contains i = 2; the cycle x_0,x_2,x_3,x_1,x_0 closes P at the threshold deg(u)+deg(v) = n.\n\n- Algorithmic extraction via reverse closure (\u03b4 \u2265 n/2). Enumerate all nonedges e_1,\u2026,e_t of G (t = O(n^2)); set G_i = G + {e_1,\u2026,e_i} so that G_t = K_n. Pick any Hamiltonian cycle C_t in K_n. For i = t,\u2026,1: if e_i \u2209 E(C_i), set C_{i\u22121} := C_i; otherwise delete e_i = uv from C_i to obtain a Hamiltonian uv-path P in G_{i\u22121}, and apply Lemma 3 in G_{i\u22121} (deg_{G_{i\u22121}}(u)+deg_{G_{i\u22121}}(v) \u2265 n since e_i was eligible) to re-close to C_{i\u22121}. Invariant: C_i is a Hamiltonian cycle of G_i. With an adjacency matrix, finding a closing index i \u2208 A \u2229 B per step costs O(n); thus total O(tn) = O(n^3) in worst case (e.g., G = K_{n/2,n/2}).\n\n- Matching consequences. Under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2, Theorem 6 provides a Hamiltonian cycle. If n is even, alternate edges on the cycle to obtain a perfect matching. If n is odd, delete any vertex and alternate edges along the resulting Hamiltonian path to obtain a matching of size (n\u22121)/2.\n\n- Sanity checks. Balanced bipartite K_{n/2,n/2} (n even) has \u03b4 = n/2, is triangle-free, Hamiltonian, and closure adds all intra-part edges in one batch to reach K_n. For C_4 (n = 4), \u03b4 = 2 and the closure adds both diagonals; both fit the closure framework and Lemma 3.\n\n- Next targets. (i) Pancyclicity: Bondy (1971) shows that a Hamiltonian graph with e(G) \u2265 n^2/4 is pancyclic unless G \u2245 K_{n/2,n/2}; adapt via triangle/bipartite dichotomy and rotation\u2013extension. (ii) Dirac\u2019s circumference bound c(G) \u2265 min{n, 2\u03b4} for 2-connected G; under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2 this yields Hamiltonicity.\n",

  "new_outputs_md": "Corollary 12 (Closing any Hamiltonian path under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2). Let G be a graph on n \u2265 3 vertices with \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2. If G has a Hamiltonian path with endpoints u and v, then G has a Hamiltonian cycle.\nProof. We have deg(u) \u2265 n/2 and deg(v) \u2265 n/2, so deg(u)+deg(v) \u2265 n. Apply Lemma 3 to close the path. \u220e\n\nCorollary 13 (Perfect matching for even n under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2). Let G be a graph on n \u2265 3 vertices with n even and \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2. Then G has a perfect matching.\nProof. By Theorem 6, G has a Hamiltonian cycle C. Taking every other edge along C yields a matching that saturates all vertices. \u220e\n\nCorollary 14 (Near-perfect matching for odd n under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2). Let G be a graph on n \u2265 3 vertices with n odd and \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2. Then G has a matching of size (n\u22121)/2.\nProof. By Theorem 6, G has a Hamiltonian cycle C on n vertices. Remove any vertex w to obtain a Hamiltonian path on the remaining n\u22121 vertices; alternating its edges gives a matching of size (n\u22121)/2. \u220e\n\nProposition 15 (Constructive extraction of a Hamiltonian cycle under \u03b4 \u2265 n/2). There is a procedure that, given a graph G on n \u2265 3 vertices with \u03b4(G) \u2265 n/2 and adjacency-matrix access, outputs a Hamiltonian cycle in worst-case time O(n^3).\nProof. Enumerate all nonedges of G as e_1,\u2026,e_t (t = O(n^2)). Define G_i = G + {e_1,\u2026,e_i}; then G_t = K_n and for each i the added edge e_i = u_iv_i was eligible in G_{i\u22121}, i.e., deg_{G_{i\u22121}}(u_i)+deg_{G_{i\u22121}}(v_i) \u2265 n. Pick any Hamiltonian cycle C_t in K_n. For i = t down to 1: if e_i \u2209 E(C_i), let C_{i\u22121} = C_i; otherwise, delete e_i from C_i to obtain a Hamiltonian u_i\u2013v_i path P in G_{i\u22121}, and apply Lemma 3 within G_{i\u22121} (using deg_{G_{i\u22121}}(u_i)+deg_{G_{i\u22121}}(v_i) \u2265 n) to re-close P into a Hamiltonian cycle C_{i\u22121} of G_{i\u22121}. By induction, C_i is a Hamiltonian cycle of G_i for all i, so C_0 is a Hamiltonian cycle of G. Implementation: maintain the current graph as an adjacency matrix, initially K_n; each step removes e_i (if present) and, when needed, scans the u_i\u2013v_i path to locate an index i \u2208 A \u2229 B as in Lemma 3 in O(n) time. Total time is O(tn) = O(n^3). \u220e\n",
