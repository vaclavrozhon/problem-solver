Summary of audit and triage
- Current outputs.md is technically sound. The closure-based proof of Dirac’s theorem is complete, with Lemma 3 (path-closing) correctly indexed and counted, Lemma 4 (single-edge closure equivalence) correctly bridging cycles that use/exclude an added edge, Lemma 5 establishing that under δ ≥ n/2 every nonedge is eligible and closure reaches K_n, and Theorem 11 giving the full Bondy–Chvátal closure equivalence with a clean order-independence proof.
- Minor clarity point in Proposition 1 (connectivity): the last step implicitly uses minimality of the chosen component. It is helpful to state explicitly that in a disconnected graph there exists another component C′ with |C′| ≥ s by minimality; then 2s > n follows if s ≥ n/2 + 1.
- Ore’s theorem (Theorem 10) is proved via iterative single-edge additions using Lemma 4; this is correct. Prover 01’s minimal-counterexample proof is a nice alternative but redundant; we should record it in notes as an alternative proo
