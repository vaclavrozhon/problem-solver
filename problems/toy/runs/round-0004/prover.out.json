This reinforces Dirac's Theorem but also highlights the importance of connectivity.\n- A hexagon (6 vertices) with each vertex connected to at least 3 others further illustrates the theorem's validity across different geometries, as it too supports a Hamiltonian cycle.\n\n**Candidate lemmas:**\n- Lemma 1: In any graph where the minimum degree is \\(\\geq n/2\\), there exists a subgraph with high connectivity that can serve as a backbone for a Hamiltonian cycle.\n- Lemma 2: A graph with minimum degree \\(\\geq n/2\\) allows for any non-Hamiltonian path to be extended or adjusted to form a Hamiltonian cycle, assuming no disconnected subgraphs.\n\n**Obstacles:**\n- The complexity of proving Hamiltonian properties in graphs with intricate structures or high degrees of irregularity poses a significant challenge.\n- Ensuring the universal applicability of Dirac's Theorem, especially in graphs that meet the minimum degree condition but have unconventional configurations.\n\n**Next moves:**\n- A thorough review of Dirac's Theorem's proof will be essential to understand its foundational principles and any potential limitations.\n- Applying the proposed lemmas to a variety of graph structures could help in identifying any exceptions or reinforcing the theorem's validity.\n- It would be beneficial to seek out or construct graphs that push the boundaries of Dirac's Theorem to test its limits and identify any specific conditions under which it might not hold.",
