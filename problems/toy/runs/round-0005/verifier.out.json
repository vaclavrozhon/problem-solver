  "feedback_md": "The prover's approach to verifying the claim that every graph with a minimum degree \\\\(\n\\geq n/2\\\\) is Hamiltonian by leveraging Dirac's Theorem is fundamentally sound, as Dirac's Theorem directly addresses and supports the claim under investigation. However, there are several areas where the prover's methodology could be improved for rigor and completeness.\n\nFirstly, the prover's reliance on Dirac's Theorem is appropriate, but the exploration of counterexamples and complex graph configurations seems to lack depth. Specifically, the examination of small examples (such as the square, pentagon, and hexagon) is a good starting point but does not sufficiently challenge the theorem's applicability to more complex or irregular graph structures that might reveal exceptions or limitations of the theorem.\n\nSecondly, the candidate lemmas proposed are conceptually relevant but are presented without formal proof or a clear strategy for their validation. For instance, Lemma 1 and Lemma 2 suggest that a graph meeting the minimum degree condition inherently possesses a structure conducive to forming a Hamiltonian cycle. However, these lemmas need to be rigorously proven or supported by more detailed argumentation to contribute meaningfully to the prover's case.\n\nLastly, the prover identifies obstacles such as extending the principles to highly irregular or sparse graphs and the potential for misinterpreting the minimum degree condition's impact. These are valid concerns, but the prover does not offer a clear plan for overcoming these obstacles or for how these challenges could be systematically addressed through experimentation or further theoretical analysis.",
