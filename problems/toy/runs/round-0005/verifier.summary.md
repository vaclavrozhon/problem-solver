• Dirac's Theorem is correctly identified as supporting the claim that every graph with minimum degree \\(
\geq n/2\\) is Hamiltonian, provided \\(
\geq 3\\).
• The exploration of counterexamples and complex graph configurations is insufficiently rigorous.
• Candidate lemmas are relevant but lack formal proof or detailed argumentation.
• Identified obstacles are valid but lack a clear plan for resolution.
• Next steps should include a more rigorous attempt to construct counterexamples, formal proofs of the candidate lemmas, and a detailed plan to address identified obstacles.
