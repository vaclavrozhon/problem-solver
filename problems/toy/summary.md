In this round, we explored Dirac's Theorem, which states that a graph with at least 3 vertices is Hamiltonian if every vertex has a degree of at least n/2. However, we identified limitations, including counterexamples where graphs with minimum degree ≥ n/2 are not Hamiltonian, particularly in disconnected graphs. A special case for n=3 was validated, but it does not generalize. The general approach to constructing Hamiltonian cycles from graphs with minimum degree ≥ n/2 requires further exploration and lacks rigor.

Round 0001 fixes the setting (finite, simple, undirected graphs, n ≥ 3) and corrects the earlier misconception: δ(G) ≥ n/2 forces connectivity and in fact 2‑connectivity, so disconnected/cut‑vertex counterexamples are impossible. The prover records and (mostly) proves standard lemmas: connectivity from δ ≥ n/2; sharpness via K_{n/2−1, n/2+1} (or the odd‑n variant); a longest‑path lower bound (there is a path of length ≥ δ+1); and the Bondy–Chvátal single‑edge closure step (if uv is a nonedge with deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, then adding uv preserves Hamiltonicity) proved by a pigeonhole argument along a Hamiltonian path. Iterating the closure yields K_n under δ ≥ n/2, hence Dirac's theorem follows. The verifier flags and corrects one minor error about K_{n/2,n/2} closure. Remaining work is a full formal writeup of the iterative closure (or an optional Ore/longest‑path alternative) and a final LaTeXized proof.

In Round 0001, the focus was on establishing the conditions under which a simple, undirected graph with minimum degree δ(G) ≥ n/2 is Hamiltonian, as per Dirac's theorem. Key lemmas were developed, including connectivity implications, sharpness of the degree bound, and a longest path lower bound. The Bondy–Chvátal closure theorem was introduced as a critical step in proving Hamiltonicity, with a corollary linking it to Dirac's theorem. Special cases were examined, including the case of a cycle of length n−1, and counterexamples were explored to reinforce the established conditions. The round concluded with a plan for a full formal writeup and potential alternative proofs.
