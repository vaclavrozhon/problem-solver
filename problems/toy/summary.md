In this round, we explored Dirac's Theorem, which states that a graph with at least 3 vertices is Hamiltonian if every vertex has a degree of at least n/2. However, we identified limitations, including counterexamples where graphs with minimum degree ≥ n/2 are not Hamiltonian, particularly in disconnected graphs. A special case for n=3 was validated, but it does not generalize. The general approach to constructing Hamiltonian cycles from graphs with minimum degree ≥ n/2 requires further exploration and lacks rigor.

Round 0001 fixes the setting (finite, simple, undirected graphs, n ≥ 3) and corrects the earlier misconception: δ(G) ≥ n/2 forces connectivity and in fact 2‑connectivity, so disconnected/cut‑vertex counterexamples are impossible. The prover records and (mostly) proves standard lemmas: connectivity from δ ≥ n/2; sharpness via K_{n/2−1, n/2+1} (or the odd‑n variant); a longest‑path lower bound (there is a path of length ≥ δ+1); and the Bondy–Chvátal single‑edge closure step (if uv is a nonedge with deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, then adding uv preserves Hamiltonicity) proved by a pigeonhole argument along a Hamiltonian path. Iterating the closure yields K_n under δ ≥ n/2, hence Dirac's theorem follows. The verifier flags and corrects one minor error about K_{n/2,n/2} closure. Remaining work is a full formal writeup of the iterative closure (or an optional Ore/longest‑path alternative) and a final LaTeXized proof.

In Round 0001, the focus was on establishing the conditions under which a simple, undirected graph with minimum degree δ(G) ≥ n/2 is Hamiltonian, as per Dirac's theorem. Key lemmas were developed, including connectivity implications, sharpness of the degree bound, and a longest path lower bound. The Bondy–Chvátal closure theorem was introduced as a critical step in proving Hamiltonicity, with a corollary linking it to Dirac's theorem. Special cases were examined, including the case of a cycle of length n−1, and counterexamples were explored to reinforce the established conditions. The round concluded with a plan for a full formal writeup and potential alternative proofs.

Round summary: Prover-01 and Prover-02 supply a complete closure-based proof plan for Dirac's theorem (n = |V| ≥ 3). Key steps: prove the path-closing lemma for a Hamiltonian path P with endpoints u,v (if deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n then P closes to a Hamiltonian cycle); deduce the single-edge closure equivalence (adding a nonedge uv with deg-sum ≥ n preserves Hamiltonicity both ways); iterate this safe addition under δ(G) ≥ n/2 to obtain K_n and conclude G is Hamiltonian. Both provers also record supporting lemmas (δ ≥ n/2 implies connected and 2‑connected), small technical checks on indexing/endpoints, and sharpness examples (K_{k−1,k+1} and K_{k,k+1}). Optional alternative routes (Ore or Pósa) are noted. outputs.md was not produced in this round; the Verifier reports success on the submitted summaries.

The round audits and micro‑refinements confirm the Dirac proof via Bondy–Chvátal closure is correct and complete for n≥3. Key lemmas (path‑closing, single‑edge closure equivalence) and the iterative augmentation to K_n are logically sound; degrees increase monotonically so eligibility persists. Minor clarity edits were suggested (make the “two components” sentence explicit in Prop.1, state deg‑sums are measured in G in Lemma 4, and keep the indexing in Lemma 3 explicit). Several short, useful corollaries were recommended for outputs.md: Ore’s theorem, the Bondy–Chvátal closure equivalence, the ≥2 common‑neighbors fact and diam(G) ≤ 2 under δ ≥ n/2, and a constructive algorithm to extract a Hamiltonian cycle by reversing the closure. Sanity‑check examples (K_{n/2,n/2}, small n) validate sharpness. Verifier: success. Citations: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json, verifier output.
