In this round, we explored Dirac's Theorem, which states that a graph with at least 3 vertices is Hamiltonian if every vertex has a degree of at least n/2. However, we identified limitations, including counterexamples where graphs with minimum degree ≥ n/2 are not Hamiltonian, particularly in disconnected graphs. A special case for n=3 was validated, but it does not generalize. The general approach to constructing Hamiltonian cycles from graphs with minimum degree ≥ n/2 requires further exploration and lacks rigor.
