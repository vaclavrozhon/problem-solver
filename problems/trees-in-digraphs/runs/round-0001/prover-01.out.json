Replace the uniform threshold 2\u2113^k at every level by the sharp constant T* = ceil(\u2113^k \u00b7 \u2113/(\u2113\u22121)), which is tight for the bottleneck step i = k\u22121. This lowers the additive overhead from 2k\u2113^k to k\u00b7ceil(\u2113^k \u00b7 \u2113/(\u2113\u22121)).\n- Improve the h-parameter in Theorem 3.6 (supergraph_of_normalized). The greedy ray-selection only needs h \u2265 |V(B^+_{k,\u2113})| + k\u2113\u00b7|L| + \u2113 = (\u2113^{k+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121) + k\u2113^{k+1} + \u2113, not 3k\u2113^{k+1}.\n- Slightly improve the k=2 \u201cgiant spider\u201d bound by counting directed 2-walks instead of 2-paths. This yields a strictly better bound for small \u2113 (e.g. \u03b4^+ \u2265 6 suffices for \u2113=2), while asymptotically the constant tends to (3+\u221a17)/2.\n\nResults and proofs\n\n1) A sharper outstar-with-leaves property\n\nTheorem A (refinement of Theorem 3.7). Let \u03a0 be a \u03b4^+-common property, k \u2265 1 and \u2113 \u2265 2. Set\nT* = \u2308\u2113^k \u00b7 \u2113/(\u2113\u22121)\u2309.\nIf G is a digraph with \u03b4^+(G) \u2265 d(\u03a0) + k\u00b7T*, then G contains a copy B of B^+_{k,\u2113} such that all leaves of B satisfy \u03a0 in G.\n\nWhy useful here. This replaces the additive margin 2k\u2113^k by k\u00b7T*; for \u2113 \u2265 3 this is a factor improvement from 2 to \u2113/(\u2113\u22121) = 1 + 1/(\u2113\u22121).\n\nSketch of proof. Redefine \u0393(0) = {v: v has \u03a0} and, for i \u2265 1,\n\u0393(i) = {v : deg^+_{\u0393(i\u22121)}(v) \u2265 T*}.\nThe lexicographic-minimum-vector argument proving \u0393(k) \u2260 \u2205 goes through verbatim with thresholds T* (the only change is that we now assume \u03b4^+(G) \u2265 d(\u03a0) + \u2211_i T* = d(\u03a0) + k\u00b7T*).\nFrom v \u2208 \u0393(k) build B iteratively. Suppose we have B_i \u2245 B^+_{i,\u2113} with leaves L_i (|L_i| = \u2113^i) and |V(B_i)| = (\u2113^{i+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121). To extend each leaf w \u2208 L_i, we must choose \u2113 new children in \u0393(k\u2212i\u22121), disjoint from V(B_i) and disjoint across different leaves. The total number of forbidden vertices when choosing for the j-th leaf is at most |V(B_i)| + \u2113(j\u22121). Thus it suffices that every w has at least M_i := |V(B_i)| + \u2113|L_i| available out-neighbours in \u0393(k\u2212i\u22121). A simple bound gives\nM_i = (\u2113^{i+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121) + \u2113^{i+1} \u2264 \u2113^{i+1} \u00b7 \u2113/(\u2113\u22121) \u2264 \u2113^k \u00b7 \u2113/(\u2113\u22121) \u2264 T*.\nGreedy choice works and yields B_{i+1} with leaves in \u0393(k\u2212i\u22121). At the end we obtain B = B_k with all leaves in \u0393(0), i.e., all leaves satisfy \u03a0.\n\n2) A better h in Theorem 3.6\n\nLemma B (disjoint rays selection). Let L be a set of \u2113^k leaves, and for each w \u2208 L let S(w) be a copy of S^-_{k,h} centred at w. If\nh \u2265 |V(B)| + k\u2113\u00b7|L| + \u2113,\nthen one can choose, for every w \u2208 L, a subgraph S\u2032(w) \u2245 S^-_{k,\u2113} such that all S\u2032(w) are pairwise vertex-disjoint and each S\u2032(w) is disjoint from B except at its centre w.\n\nProof. Order L arbitrarily. Let U be the union of B and all previously chosen S\u2032. When choosing S\u2032(w), each vertex of U\\{w} lies on at most one ray of S(w), so at most |U|\u22121 rays are blocked. If h \u2265 |U|\u22121 + \u2113, we can pick \u2113 unblocked rays. Since |U| \u2264 |V(B)| + k\u2113\u00b7|L| at all steps, the stated bound on h suffices.\n\nCorollary C (refined version of Theorem 3.6). Let k \u2265 1, \u2113 \u2265 2 and put\nh0 := (\u2113^{k+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121) + k\u2113^{k+1} + \u2113.\nIf \u03b4^+(G) \u2265 f(k,h0) + k\u00b7\u2308\u2113^k \u00b7 \u2113/(\u2113\u22121)\u2309, then G contains T(k,\u2113) as a subgraph.\n\nProof. Apply Theorem A with \u03a0 = \u201cis a centre of S^-_{k,h0}\u201d (\u03b4^+-common by Proposition 3.5), obtaining B \u2245 B^+_{k,\u2113} whose leaves L are centres of S^-_{k,h0}. Use Lemma B with |V(B)| = (\u2113^{k+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121) and |L| = \u2113^k to extract the required disjoint S\u2032(w), w \u2208 L.\n\nRemarks.\n- The original proof used T = 2\u2113^k (sum 2k\u2113^k) and h = 3k\u2113^{k+1}. The present bounds improve both constants to k\u00b7\u2113^k\u00b7\u2113/(\u2113\u22121) and k\u2113^{k+1} + O(\u2113^k), respectively. As f(k,\u00b7) from [1] grows quickly in its second argument, halving the leading constant in h transfers into an exponential improvement in the \u03b4^+ threshold implicit in f.\n- For \u2113 = 2 we have \u2113/(\u2113\u22121) = 2, so the T-part matches the original; for \u2113 \u2265 3 we obtain a genuine reduction.\n\n3) Improved linear bound for S^-_{2,\u2113}\n\nTheorem D (refines Theorem 1.4 for small \u2113). For every \u2113 \u2265 1, any digraph G with minimum out-degree d satisfying\n\nd > d_*(\u2113) := ( (3\u2113\u22121) + \u221a(17\u2113^2 \u2212 10\u2113 + 1) ) / 2\ncontains S^-_{2,\u2113} as a subgraph.\n\nProof. Repeat the proof of Theorem 1.4 but count directed 2-walks instead of directed 2-paths. Partition V = A \u2294 B by A := {v : deg^\u2212(v) \u2265 2\u2113}, B := {v : deg^\u2212(v) < 2\u2113}. After handling the \u201ceasy\u201d case deg^\u2212_A(r) \u2265 2\u2113 as in the paper, assume deg^\u2212_A(v) \u2264 2\u2113\u22121 for all v \u2208 A and, by deleting edges if necessary, deg^+(v) = d for all v.\nLet X \u21d2 Y \u21d2 Z denote the set of directed 2-walks with middle in Y and end in Z. Then\n|V \u21d2 B \u21d2 A| = |A \u21d2 V \u21d2 V| \u2212 |A \u21d2 A \u21d2 V| + |B \u21d2 B \u21d2 V| \u2212 |V \u21d2 B \u21d2 B|.\nUsing deg^+(\u00b7) = d and deg^\u2212(y) \u2264 2\u2113\u22121 for y \u2208 B,\n|A \u21d2 V \u21d2 V| = |A| d^2,\n|A \u21d2 A \u21d2 V| \u2264 e(G[A]) d \u2264 (2\u2113\u22121) d |A|,\n|B \u21d2 B \u21d2 V| = e(G[B]) d,\n|V \u21d2 B \u21d2 B| \u2264 e(G[B]) (2\u2113\u22121).\nHence |V \u21d2 B \u21d2 A| \u2265 |A| d(d\u22122\u2113+1). Averaging gives a \u2208 A with |V \u21d2 B \u21d2 {a}| \u2265 d(d\u22122\u2113+1). Let s be the maximum number of pairwise vertex-disjoint 2-walks of the form q_i \u2192 b_i \u2192 a with b_i \u2208 B and all q_i distinct. Then the number of such 2-walks using b_i in S := {b_1,\u2026,b_s} is at most (2\u2113\u22121)s, and by maximality every 2-walk to a through B\\S starts in Q := {q_1,\u2026,q_s}, giving d s \u2265 d(d\u22122\u2113+1) \u2212 (2\u2113\u22121)s. Thus\ns \u2265 d(d\u22122\u2113+1)/(d+2\u2113\u22121).\nIf s \u2265 \u2113 we obtain S^-_{2,\u2113}. Solving s \u2265 \u2113 for d yields d > d_*(\u2113), as claimed.\n\nNumerics. The improvement is strict for each fixed \u2113; e.g. \u2113=2 gives d \u2265 6 (old bound \u2248 7.12), \u2113=3 gives d \u2265 10 (old bound \u2248 10.68), \u2113=4 gives d \u2265 14 (old bound \u2248 14.24). As \u2113 \u2192 \u221e the constant approaches (3+\u221a17)/2, matching the asymptotics of the original proof.\n\nObstacles and limitations\n\n- The walk-based refinement in Theorem D cannot (by this method) beat the asymptotic constant (3+\u221a17)/2, because the bottleneck is the unavoidable subtraction of contributions with small in-degree in B and the trivial per-source bound d.\n- For Theorem A the uniform threshold T* is essentially sharp for the greedy extension step: at i = k\u22121 one must accommodate simultaneously |V(B_{k\u22121})| + \u2113|L_{k\u22121}| \u2248 \u2113^k \u00b7 \u2113/(\u2113\u22121) forbidden vertices. Any further reduction would require a non-greedy (e.g. matching/nibble) selection across all leaves at once, which introduces codegree issues hard to control without extra structure.\n\nNext steps\n\n- Try a simultaneous (global) selection of children for all leaves using bipartite edge-coloring or the R\u00f6dl nibble, aiming to replace T* by (1+o(1))\u2113^k and reduce the additive overhead from k\u00b7\u2113^k\u00b7\u2113/(\u2113\u22121) to (1+o(1))k\u2113^k.\n- Improve h further by a global packing of rays across all S(w), potentially lowering h from k\u2113^{k+1} + O(\u2113^k) to (1+o(1))k\u2113^{k+1}.\n- For k=2 explore hybrid arguments that exploit the distribution of deg^\u2212 on B to lower the constant toward 3, e.g. via a dyadic decomposition of B by in-degree and a refined double-counting across levels.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Aboulker, Cohen, Havet, Lochet, Moura, Thomass\u00e9 (2016).
