This substantially improves the additive term in Theorem 2.6 (Theorem 4 in the paper).\n- Sharpen the \u201cdisjoint rays\u201d extraction used in Theorem 2.6 to reduce h in the property \u201ccentre of S^-_{k,h}\u201d from 3k\\ell^{k+1} to k\\ell^{k+1}+2\\ell^k+\\ell.\n- Comment on possible improvements to the linear bound for S^-_{2,\\ell}; outline why the present counting route seems near its limit without a new idea.\n\n# A refined \u201cout-arborescence with prescribed leaves\u201d theorem\n\nWe adapt Theorem 2.5 by using non-uniform thresholds. Let \\(\\mathcal P\\) be a \\(\\delta^+\\)-common property. Fix integers \\(k\\ge 1\\) and \\(\\ell\\ge 2\\). Define sets \\(\\Gamma(i)\\subseteq V(G)\\) by\n- \\(\\Gamma(0)=\\{v:\\ v\\text{ satisfies }\\mathcal P\\}\\),\n- for \\(1\\le i\\le k\\), \\(\\Gamma(i)=\\{v:\\ \\deg^+_{\\Gamma(i-1)}(v)\\ge t_i\\}\\),\nwith thresholds\n\\[\n t_k:=\\ell,\\qquad t_{k-i}:=\\ell^{i+1}+\\Big\\lceil\\frac{\\ell^{i+1}-1}{\\ell-1}\\Big\\rceil\\quad (1\\le i\\le k-1).\n\\]\n\nThe new thresholds are tailored to the combinatorics of the greedy construction at depth \\(i\\): the term \\(\\ell^{i+1}\\) pays for simultaneously assigning \\(\\ell\\) new children to each of the \\(\\ell^i\\) current leaves, and the term \\(\\lceil(\\ell^{i+1}-1)/(\\ell-1)\\rceil\\) upper-bounds the number of vertices already used before reaching that depth.\n\nDefine the sum\n\\[\n S_{k,\\ell}:=\\sum_{i=1}^k t_i=\\ell+\\sum_{i=1}^{k-1}\\left(\\ell^{i+1}+\\Big\\lceil\\tfrac{\\ell^{i+1}-1}{\\ell-1}\\Big\\rceil\\right).\n\\]\nA convenient explicit upper bound is\n\\[\n S_{k,\\ell}\\le \\frac{\\ell^{k+1}-\\ell}{\\ell-1}+\\frac{\\ell^{k+1}-\\ell}{\\ell-1}+\\ell=\\frac{2(\\ell^{k+1}-\\ell)}{\\ell-1}+\\ell\\le \\frac{2\\ell}{\\ell-1}\\,\\ell^k+\\ell.\n\\]\nIn particular, \\(S_{k,2}\\le 4\\cdot 2^{k}-4+2<4\\cdot 2^k\\), and for fixed \\(\\ell\\) the sum is \\(\\Theta(\\ell^k)\\) (independent of \\(k\\) up to a constant depending only on \\(\\ell\\)).\n\nThe proof follows the structure of Theorem 2.5, with two changes: (i) the \u201clevel-set\u201d contradiction uses the variable thresholds \\(t_i\\), and (ii) the greedy extension at depth \\(i\\) uses the sharper accounting of pre-used vertices.\n\n\nClaim 1 (Level-set contradiction with variable thresholds). If \\(\\delta^+(G)\\ge d(\\mathcal P)+\\sum_{i=1}^k t_i\\), then \\(\\Gamma(k)\\neq\\emptyset\\).\n\nSketch. Repeat the lex-order argument verbatim, but with \\(t_i\\) in place of the constant bound \\(2\\ell^k\\). If \\(\\Gamma(k)=\\emptyset\\), let \\(z\\) be the minimal (under lex order) nonempty class, set \\(X:=V_{\\vec 0}\\) and \\(W:=\\bigcup_{i: z_{i+1}=0}\\Gamma(i)\\). For any \\(v\\in V_z\\), the inequality \\(\\deg^+_W(v)<\\sum_{i: z_{i+1}=0} t_{i+1}\\) holds by definition of the \\(\\Gamma(i)\\). If \\(z\\ne\\vec 0\\), this contradicts \\(\\delta^+(G)\\). If \\(z=\\vec 0\\), then \\(\\delta^+(G[X])\\ge \\delta^+(G)-\\sum_i t_i\\ge d(\\mathcal P)\\), so some \\(x\\in X\\) satisfies \\(\\mathcal P\\) in \\(G\\), hence \\(x\\in \\Gamma(0)\\), contradicting \\(x\\in X\\). \u220e\n\nClaim 2 (Greedy construction with the new thresholds). From any \\(v\\in\\Gamma(k)\\) we can build a copy \\(B\\) of \\(B^+_{k,\\ell}\\) rooted at \\(v\\) so that the leaves of the depth-\\(i\\) tree \\(B_i\\) lie in \\(\\Gamma(k-i)\\), for \\(i=0,1,\\dots,k\\).\n\nProof. The base step uses \\(t_k=\\ell\\). For the induction step from depth \\(i\\) to \\(i+1\\), let \\(L\\) be the (\\(\\ell^i\\) many) leaves of \\(B_i\\). The number of vertices used so far is \\(|V(B_i)|=\\sum_{j=0}^{i}\\ell^j=(\\ell^{i+1}-1)/(\\ell-1)\\). For each \\(w\\in L\\), since \\(w\\in \\Gamma(k-i)\\), we have\n\\[\n \\deg^+_{\\Gamma(k-i-1)}(w)\\ge t_{k-i}=\\ell^{i+1}+\\Big\\lceil\\frac{\\ell^{i+1}-1}{\\ell-1}\\Big\\rceil.\n\\]\nDeleting the already used vertices can remove at most \\((\\ell^{i+1}-1)/(\\ell-1)\\) of these neighbours, leaving every \\(w\\) with at least \\(\\ell^{i+1}\\) candidates in \\(\\Gamma(k-i-1)\\). Now process the leaves one by one; by the time we reach the \\(j\\)-th leaf we have used at most \\(\\ell(j-1)\\) new vertices at this depth. Since \\(\\ell(j-1)\\le \\ell^{i+1}-\\ell\\), there still remain at least \\(\\ell\\) candidates for the current leaf. Hence we can assign \\(\\ell\\) distinct children to every leaf, obtaining \\(B_{i+1}\\). \u220e\n\nCombining the two claims yields:\n\nTheorem A (Refinement of Theorem 2.5). Let \\(\\mathcal P\\) be \\(\\delta^+\\)-common, and \\(k\\ge 1,\\ \\ell\\ge 2\\). If\n\\[\n \\delta^+(G)\\ \\ge\\ d(\\mathcal P)+S_{k,\\ell},\n\\]\nthen \\(G\\) contains a copy \\(B\\) of \\(B^+_{k,\\ell}\\) whose leaves all satisfy \\(\\mathcal P\\).\n\nCompared to \\(d(\\mathcal P)+2k\\ell^k\\) in Theorem 2.5, the new additive term is\n\\(S_{k,\\ell}=\\Theta(\\ell^k)\\), independent of \\(k\\) up to a constant depending only on \\(\\ell\\).\n\n# A sharper h for attaching the in-spiders\n\nIn Theorem 2.6 the choice \\(h=3k\\ell^{k+1}\\) is used to greedily extract disjoint copies \\(S'(w)\\cong S^-_{k,\\ell}\\) from \\(S(w)\\cong S^-_{k,h}\\) at each leaf \\(w\\) of \\(B\\). A tighter bookkeeping shows that\n\\[\n h\\ge k\\ell^{k+1}+2\\ell^k+\\ell\n\\]\nalready suffices.\n\nIndeed, at the moment of choosing \\(S'(w)\\) for a given leaf \\(w\\):\n- the tree \\(B\\) occupies at most \\(|V(B)|=\\sum_{i=0}^{k}\\ell^i\\le 2\\ell^k\\) vertices (hence blocks at most that many rays of \\(S(w)\\)),\n- previously chosen \\(S'(w')\\) for other leaves \\(w'\\) occupy at most \\(k\\ell\\) vertices each off their centres, so after handling up to \\(\\ell^k-1\\) leaves they block at most \\(k\\ell(\\ell^k-1)\\le k\\ell^{k+1}\\) rays of \\(S(w)\\),\n- different rays of \\(S(w)\\) are internally disjoint and each external vertex lies on at most one ray of \\(S(w)\\).\nThus, strictly fewer than \\(k\\ell^{k+1}+2\\ell^k\\) rays can be blocked, leaving at least \\(h-(k\\ell^{k+1}+2\\ell^k)\\) usable rays. If this is \\(\\ge \\ell\\), we can pick \\(\\ell\\) disjoint rays to form \\(S'(w)\\).\n\nCombining with Theorem A (taking \\(\\mathcal P\\) to be \u201cis the centre of a copy of \\(S^-_{k,h}\\)\u201d), we obtain the following quantitative improvement of Theorem 2.6.\n\nCorollary B (Improved Theorem 2.6). Let \\(k\\ge 1,\\ \\ell\\ge 2\\) and set \\(h:=k\\ell^{k+1}+2\\ell^k+\\ell\\). If\n\\[\n \\delta^+(G)\\ \\ge\\ f(k,h)+S_{k,\\ell},\n\\]\nthen \\(G\\) contains a copy of \\(T(k,\\ell)\\). Here \\(S_{k,\\ell}\\) is as in Theorem A, and can be bounded by \\(S_{k,\\ell}\\le \\tfrac{2\\ell}{\\ell-1}\\,\\ell^k+\\ell\\).\n\nRemarks.\n- This reduces the additive term from \\(2k\\ell^k\\) to \\(\\Theta(\\ell^k)\\), a polynomial-in-\\(\\ell\\) improvement independent of \\(k\\). The required \\(h\\) is also reduced by a factor \\(\\approx 3\\).\n- Any future improvement of \\(f(k,h)\\) (existence of \\(S^-_{k,h}\\)) instantly propagates to a better bound here.\n\n# On S^-_{2,\\ell}: why the current method seems near its limit\n\nTrying to lower the constant in Theorem 3.1 by reparametrizing the partition \\(V=A\\cup B\\) does not help unless one changes the \u201ceasy case\u201d (greedy construction inside \\(A\\)). That case crucially uses the guarantee \\(\\deg^-(a)\\ge 2\\ell\\) for every \\(a\\in A\\) to pick distinct predecessors \\(x_i\\). If one lowers the threshold for \\(A\\) below \\(2\\ell\\), that greedy step can fail. On the other hand, the counting step\n\\[\n|V\\to B\\to A|\\ge d(d-2\\ell)|A|+e(G[B])(d-2\\ell)\n\\]\nappears tight under only \\(\\deg^+(v)\\equiv d\\), \\(\\deg^-_A\\le 2\\ell-1\\) on \\(A\\), and \\(\\deg^-(b)\\le 2\\ell-1\\) on \\(B\\). Marginal tweaks (e.g. replacing \\(2\\ell\\) by \\(2\\ell-1\\) in one place) give at best tiny constant improvements. A more substantial gain likely needs a new ingredient (e.g. a matching or augmenting-path argument in the bipartite graph of predecessors) that can certify many vertex-disjoint length-2 in-paths to some \\(a\\in A\\) from degree information alone.\n\n# Examples and sanity checks\n\n- For \\(\\ell=2\\), \\(S_{k,2}<4\\cdot 2^k\\). In contrast, the paper\u2019s additive term is \\(2k\\cdot 2^k\\). Already for \\(k=6\\), this replaces \\(128\\,k\\) by \\(<256\\).\n- For \\(\\ell=10\\) and general \\(k\\), we get \\(S_{k,10}\\le (20/9)\\cdot 10^k+10\\), versus the paper\u2019s \\(2k\\cdot 10^k\\).\n\n# Obstacles\n\n- The main bottleneck remains the bound \\(f(k,h)\\) for \\(S^-_{k,h}\\); the best available from \\cite{aboulker1610subdivisions} is very large. Any linear-in-\\(h\\) bound (even with a \\(k\\)-dependent constant) would make Theorem 2.6 essentially linear in \\(\\ell^k\\).\n- Improving Theorem 3.1 to a constant \\(<3.56\\) by the same two-phase scheme seems unlikely without a new mechanism to create many disjoint \\(V\\to B\\to a\\) paths (e.g. a robust matching lower bound in the predecessor graph).\n\n# Next steps\n\n- Try to prove a polynomial (in \\(h\\)) bound for \\(f(k,h)\\) using a layering-plus-expansion scheme tailored to min out-degree (even \\(h^{O(k)}\\) would be impactful).\n- Investigate extensions of Theorem 2.4 to grounded trees where the minimal subtree on \\(U\\) is \u201calmost\u201d an out-arborescence (e.g. bounded number of backward edges), by augmenting the above framework with small switching gadgets.\n- Explore whether a genuine matching argument (Hall/K\u0151nig) in the predecessor bipartite graph can push the \\(3.56\\) constant for \\(S^-_{2,\\ell}\\) closer to \\(3\\) or even \\(2+\\varepsilon\\).\n\n# Proof details to be checked by the verifier\n\n- The two claims in Theorem A mirror those in Theorem 2.5 and only require replacing the uniform threshold by \\(t_i\\) and using the exact bound \\(|V(B_i)|=(\\ell^{i+1}-1)/(\\ell-1)\\). All inequalities are displayed above.\n- The improved \\(h\\) bound in Corollary B follows from the refined ray-blocking count; each previously chosen vertex blocks at most one ray of a fixed \\(S(w)\\).\n"
