This yields a smaller \u03b4+ threshold, provably sufficient by a refined greedy packing argument.\\n- Reduce the parameter h used in Theorem 3.4 (the size of the in-star subdivision we require at the leaves) from 3k\u2113^{k+1} down to k\u2113^{k+1} + 2\u2113^k + \u2113. This lowers the bound fed into f(k,h) from [1], and propagates to a significantly smaller quantitative \u03b4+ bound (since f grows very quickly in h).\\n- Point out a gap in the proof of Theorem 4.3 (linear bound for S^-_{2,\u2113}): the step \u201cby maximality of s, all these paths have their first vertex in Q\u201d is not justified. Propose a corrected counting that gives a slightly weaker inequality; the original constant 3.56 seems to require a different augmentation argument.\\n\\nImprovement 1: Sharpen Theorem 3.3\\n\\nStatement (sharpened). Let \u2113 \u2265 2, k \u2265 1, and let P be a \u03b4+-common property with threshold d(P). Define\\n- M := (\u2113^k \u2212 1)/(\u2113 \u2212 1), and\\n- \u03b2 := \u2113^k + M.\\nIf \u03b4^+(G) \u2265 d(P) + k\u03b2, then G contains a copy B of B^+_{k,\u2113} such that all leaves of B satisfy P in G.\\n\\nWhy this helps here: This reduces the add-on from 2k\u2113^k down to k(\u2113^k + (\u2113^k \u2212 1)/(\u2113 \u2212 1)), improving Theorem 3.3 as stated in the paper.\\n\\nProof sketch (modification of the original argument).\\n- Define \u0393(0) as in the paper, and for i \u2265 1 put \u0393(i) := {v : deg^+_{\u0393(i\u22121)}(v) \u2265 \u03b2}.\\n- The lexicographic-minimum-vector argument (Claim 3.5 in the paper) carries through verbatim with 2\u2113^k replaced by \u03b2. In the case z \u2260 0, we have deg^+_W(v) < |I|\u03b2 \u2264 k\u03b2; in the case z = 0, we get \u03b4^+(G[X]) \u2265 d(P), contradicting the anti-monotonicity of P. Hence \u0393(k) \u2260 \u2205.\\n- Greedy construction of B: let v \u2208 \u0393(k). Build B_i inductively as in the paper. At step i (0 \u2264 i \u2264 k\u22121), the leaves L of B_i lie in \u0393(k\u2212i). For every w \u2208 L we have deg^+_{\u0393(k\u2212i\u22121)}(w) \u2265 \u03b2.\\n- We must show that for each w \u2208 L we can choose \u2113 new out-neighbours from \u0393(k\u2212i\u22121) disjoint from V(B_i) and also pairwise disjoint across w \u2208 L. We use two facts:\\n  1) Fact A: |V(B_i)| \u2264 1 + \u2113 + \u2026 + \u2113^i = (\u2113^{i+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121) \u2264 M. Hence each w has at least \u03b2 \u2212 |V(B_i)| \u2265 \u2113^k available neighbours in \u0393(k\u2212i\u22121) \\\\ V(B_i).\\n  2) Fact B (simple packing lemma): If a family of at most t := |L| \u2264 \u2113^{k\u22121} left vertices each has at least \u2113^k available neighbours in a common pool, then one can greedily assign to each left vertex a disjoint \u2113-set of neighbours. Indeed, when placing the j-th \u2113-set (j \u2264 t), at most (j\u22121)\u2113 \u2264 \u2113^k \u2212 \u2113 vertices have been used; since the current left vertex has at least \u2113^k available neighbours, there remain at least \u2113 unused neighbours.\\n- Using Facts A and B, we extend B_i to B_{i+1} with leaves in \u0393(k\u2212i\u22121). After k steps we obtain B = B_k with leaves in \u0393(0), i.e., all leaves satisfy P in G.\\n\\nThus the construction works under \u03b4^+(G) \u2265 d(P) + k\u03b2.\\n\\nImprovement 2: Reduce h in Theorem 3.4\\n\\nStatement (sharpened). Let h* := k\u2113^{k+1} + 2\u2113^k + \u2113 and P be the property \u201cv is the center of S^-_{k,h*}\u201d. Then for any digraph G with \u03b4^+(G) \u2265 f(k,h*) + k(\u2113^k + (\u2113^k \u2212 1)/(\u2113 \u2212 1)), there is a copy of T(k,\u2113) in G.\\n\\nWhy this helps here: The paper sets h = 3k\u2113^{k+1}. The tighter packing below shows that h* suffices; since f(k,h) (from [1]) grows quickly with h, replacing h by h* yields a far smaller quantitative \u03b4+.\\n\\nProof sketch (modification of Theorem 3.4).\\n- By Improvement 1 with P = \u201ccenter of S^-_{k,h*}\u201d, the graph G contains a copy B of B^+_{k,\u2113} whose \u2113^k leaves L are centers of S(w) \u2245 S^-_{k,h*} (w \u2208 L).\\n- We now choose for each w \u2208 L a subspider S\u2032(w) \u2245 S^-_{k,\u2113} contained in S(w) so that the family {S\u2032(w)} is pairwise vertex-disjoint and disjoint from B\\nexcept at w. We proceed greedily over w.\\n- The union of B with previously chosen S\u2032(w\u2032) has size at most |V(B)| + (|already chosen leaves|) \u00b7 (k\u2113) \u2264 2\u2113^k + (\u2113^k \u2212 1)k\u2113.\\n- Inside S(w), any vertex \u2260 w lies on exactly one ray. Hence at most 2\u2113^k + (\u2113^k \u2212 1)k\u2113 rays of S(w) can be blocked by the previously chosen union. Since S(w) has h* rays and h* \u2212 [2\u2113^k + (\u2113^k \u2212 1)k\u2113] = \u2113, at least \u2113 rays remain available to form S\u2032(w).\\n- Choosing these \u2113 rays for each w yields the desired copy of T(k,\u2113).\\n\\nRemarks.\\n- The proof only uses disjointness and does not assume any structure on overlaps between the various S(w); the h* bound is tight for this argument up to the additive +\u2113 (which we keep for clarity).\\n- Numerically, h* = k\u2113^{k+1} + 2\u2113^k + \u2113 \u226a 3k\u2113^{k+1} once \u2113 \u2265 3.\\n\\nIssue detected in the proof of Theorem 4.3 (k = 2 spiders)\\n\\n- In the last part of the proof, after fixing a \u2208 A with |V \u2192 B \u2192 {a}| \u2265 d(d \u2212 2\u2113), the argument takes a maximum-size family {(q_i,b_i)} with b_i \u2208 N^-_B(a), q_i \u2209 S \u222a {a}, and asserts: \u201cBy maximality of s, all the remaining paths V \u2192 (B \\\\ S) \u2192 {a} start in Q.\u201d\\n- This implication is not valid as stated: a remaining path may start in S or at a itself without contradicting maximality (since the choice q_i \u2208 S is disallowed in the construction of the family {(q_i,b_i)}). Therefore, the lower bound used on the number of Q \u2192 (B \\\\ S) \u2192 {a} paths does not follow.\\n- A safe correction is to bound the contribution from S \u222a {a} explicitly by s\u00b7d + d and deduce\\n  s\u00b7d \u2265 [d(d \u2212 2\u2113) \u2212 (2\u2113 \u2212 1)s] \u2212 (sd + d),\\n  which simplifies to s \u2265 [d(d \u2212 2\u2113 \u2212 1)]/[2d + (2\u2113 \u2212 1)]. This yields a weaker constant (about 2 + \u221a6 \u2248 4.449 for large \u2113) rather than (3 + \u221a17)/2 \u2248 3.561.\\n- Conclusion: the 3.56 constant needs a refined augmentation/matching argument that prevents S \u222a {a} from carrying many remaining paths. For instance, one might aim to pick S and Q as a maximum matching between (V \\\\ (Y \u222a {a})) and Y = N^-_B(a) and then argue that edges from Y into Y \\\\ S are sparse under \u03b4+ regularity; or use an alternating-path rerouting to ensure that most paths from Y \\\\ S enter Q rather than S \u222a {a}. We did not complete such a rerouting while preserving the vertex-disjointness constraints.\\n\\nExamples/sanity checks\\n\\n- Improvement 1 for k = 1: \u03b2 = \u2113 + (\u2113 \u2212 1)/(\u2113 \u2212 1) = \u2113 + 1, so \u03b4^+(G) \u2265 d(P) + k\u03b2 = d(P) + (\u2113 + 1) suffices. This matches the natural intuition that to grow an \u2113-ary out-star with leaves having property P, one needs the property threshold plus \u201c\u2113 + buffer\u201d.\\n- Improvement 2 for \u2113 = 2: h* = k\u00b72^{k+1} + 2\u00b72^k + 2 = (k + 1)\u00b72^{k+1} + 2. The paper used 3k\u00b72^{k+1}; for k \u2265 2 this is a factor ~3/(k+1) improvement inside f(k,h).\\n\\nObstacles and limits\\n\\n- In Improvement 1 we used the crude bound |V(B_i)| \u2264 M uniformly for all i, which is tight for i = k \u2212 1 but pessimistic earlier. An attempt to reduce \u03b2 further by tracking |V(B_i) \u2229 \u0393(k\u2212i\u22121)| on the fly seems to require information about \u0393-level intersections, which is not available in the abstract setting of \u03b4+-common properties.\\n- For Theorem 4.3, the matching-based obstruction is genuine: left vertices in S are forbidden as sources for the matching by design, and hence can absorb many of the remaining paths. Avoiding this difficulty seems to require a different selection of S, Q (perhaps via a two-phase greedy that first limits out-degree from S to Y \\\\ S) or a potential-function that charges such paths back to previously selected pairs.\\n\\nNext steps\\n\\n- Pursue a tightened version of Improvement 1 by replacing M with the exact bound for each stage: require deg^+_{\u0393(k\u2212i\u22121)}(w) \u2265 \u2113^k + |V(B_i) \u2229 \u0393(k\u2212i\u22121)|. Using a uniform upper bound for |V(B_i) \u2229 \u0393(k\u2212i\u22121)| strictly smaller than M (e.g., M \u2212 \u2113^{k\u22121} in many stages) would improve \u03b2 further.\\n- For Theorem 3.4, tighten the \u201c2\u2113^k\u201d term in h* to (\u2113^k \u2212 1)/(\u2113 \u2212 1) by noticing that |V(B)| = (\u2113^{k+1} \u2212 1)/(\u2113 \u2212 1) and only vertices of B that actually lie in S(w) can block rays. While worst-case overlap may still force using |V(B)|, in many regimes the effective overlap might be much smaller, permitting a refined h* with a smaller additive term.\\n- Repair Theorem 4.3 while keeping a 3.56-type constant: try selecting S, Q by an alternating-path augmentation that forbids edges from S \u222a {a} into Y \\\\ S, or show that the flow from S \u222a {a} into Y \\\\ S is o(d(d \u2212 2\u2113)) under d-regularity. Alternatively, partition B into finer degree classes and show that many b \u2208 N^-_B(a) have large in-degree from V \\\\ (S \u222a {a}).\\n\\nReferences mentioned\\n\\n- [1] Aboulker, Cohen, Havet, Lochet, Moura, Thomass\u00e9: Subdivisions in digraphs with large out-degree (for f(k,\u2113) and \u03b4^+-maderian in-arborescences).\"}",
