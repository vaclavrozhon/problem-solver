This reduces f(k,h) and thus the overall \u03b4^+-bound quantitatively.\n- Slightly tighten the constant in Theorem 4.1 (linear spiders for k=2) by using 2\u2113\u22121 instead of 2\u2113 in one place of the proof; this gives a small improvement for finite \u2113.\n\nResults and proofs\n\n1) Improved outstar-with-leaves property\n\nTheorem A (improves Theorem 3.4). Let \u2118 be \u03b4^+-common with threshold d(\u2118). Let k\u22651, \u2113\u22652. Define\nT := \u2113^k + \u2308\u2113^k/(\u2113\u22121)\u2309.\nIf \u03b4^+(G) \u2265 d(\u2118) + kT, then G contains a copy B of B^+_{k,\u2113} whose leaves satisfy \u2118 in G.\n\nWhy this improves Theorem 3.4: The original used T=2\u2113^k and the bound d(\u2118)+2k\u2113^k. Since T=\u2113^k+\u2308\u2113^k/(\u2113\u22121)\u2309 = (1+1/(\u2113\u22121))\u2113^k+O(1), the new bound is d(\u2118) + k(1+1/(\u2113\u22121))\u2113^k + O(k), which strictly improves 2k\u2113^k for all \u2113\u22653 (and matches it for \u2113=2).\n\nProof. We follow the original proof verbatim, redefining the sets \u0393(i) as\n- \u0393(0) = {v : v satisfies \u2118},\n- \u0393(i) = {v : deg^+_{\u0393(i\u22121)}(v) \u2265 T}, for i=1,\u2026,k.\nThe lexicographic-minimal-vector argument (Claim 3.5) goes through unchanged with T in place of 2\u2113^k; the only place T is used is to sum the bounds deg^+_{\u0393(i)}(v) < T for indices i with z_{i+1}=0, so that deg^+_W(v) < \u2211_{i\u2208I}T \u2264 kT. Thus, if \u03b4^+(G) \u2265 d(\u2118) + kT, we again get \u0393(k)\u2260\u2205.\n\nTo perform the greedy construction B_0,\u2026,B_k, the only needed adjustment is the expansion step B_i\u2192B_{i+1} from leaves L\u2286\u0393(k\u2212i). Each leaf w\u2208L needs \u2113 new out-neighbours in \u0393(k\u2212i\u22121) that avoid V(B_i) and avoid choices made for earlier leaves in L. We use that |V(B_i)| \u2264 \u2211_{j=0}^i \u2113^j = (\u2113^{i+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121) \u2264 \u2308\u2113^k/(\u2113\u22121)\u2309 for i\u2264k\u22121, so for every leaf w\n deg^+_{\u0393(k\u2212i\u22121)\\V(B_i)}(w) \u2265 T \u2212 |V(B_i)| \u2265 \u2113^k.\nNow process the leaves in any order: when choosing for the r-th leaf, at most r\u2113 \u2264 |L|\u2113 \u2264 \u2113^i\u00b7\u2113 = \u2113^{i+1} \u2264 \u2113^k neighbours have been reserved by previous leaves. Hence each leaf still has at least \u2113^k\u2212\u2113^{i+1} \u2265 \u2113 available choices, so we can pick \u2113 new, pairwise disjoint neighbours. This yields B_{i+1} with leaves in \u0393(k\u2212i\u22121). Iterating gives B_k with leaves in \u0393(0), i.e., satisfying \u2118. \u220e\n\nCorollary A (improves Theorem 3.3). Let k\u22651, \u2113\u22652 and put h := k\u2113^{k+1}+2\u2113^k+\u2113. Then every digraph G with\n \u03b4^+(G) \u2265 f(k,h) + k(\u2113^k + \u2308\u2113^k/(\u2113\u22121)\u2309)\ncontains T(k,\u2113) as a subgraph.\n\nProof. Take \u2118 = \u201cv is the centre of S^-_{k,h}\u201d. By Proposition 3.2, \u2118 is \u03b4^+-common with d(\u2118)=f(k,h). Apply Theorem A to obtain an embedded B^+_{k,\u2113} whose leaves L (|L|=\u2113^k) each are centres of a copy S(w)\u2245S^-_{k,h}. We choose, greedily over w\u2208L, a substar S\u2032(w)\u2245S^-_{k,\u2113} so that S\u2032(w) is disjoint from B except at w, and so that all the S\u2032(w) are pairwise disjoint. At the moment of choosing S\u2032(w), the forbidden set has size at most |V(B)| + (number of previously chosen S\u2032)\u00b7k\u2113 \u2264 2\u2113^k + (\u2113^k\u22121)k\u2113 < 2\u2113^k + k\u2113^{k+1}. Since each vertex of S(w) lies on exactly one ray of S(w), a forbidden set of size F blocks at most F rays. Thus, with h \u2265 (2\u2113^k + k\u2113^{k+1}) + \u2113, there remain at least \u2113 unblocked rays, enabling S\u2032(w). \u220e\n\nRemark. The original choice h=3k\u2113^{k+1} can be replaced by h=k\u2113^{k+1}+2\u2113^k+\u2113. This materially improves the quantitative dependence on h in f(k,h).\n\n2) Slight tightening for k=2 spiders\n\nTheorem B (refines Theorem 4.1 slightly). For every \u2113\u22651, if \u03b4^+(G) > ((3+\u221a(17\u22124/\u2113))/2)\u00b7\u2113, then G contains S^-_{2,\u2113}.\n\nProof. Repeat the proof of Theorem 4.1 verbatim, but note that for b\u2208B we have deg^\u2212(b) \u2264 2\u2113\u22121 (strict inequality in the definition of B), so |V\u2192S\u2192{a}| \u2264 (2\u2113\u22121)s rather than 2\u2113s. This yields\n s \u2265 d(d\u22122\u2113)/(d+2\u2113\u22121),\nwhence s>\u2113 as soon as d satisfies\n d(d\u22122\u2113) > \u2113(d+2\u2113\u22121) \u21d4 d > ((3+\u221a(17\u22124/\u2113))/2)\u00b7\u2113.\nFor fixed \u2113 this improves the constant slightly; asymptotically it matches (3+\u221a17)/2. \u220e\n\nExamples and sanity checks\n\n- For \u2113=2, Theorem A gives the same constant as the original (since 1+1/(\u2113\u22121)=2), so no loss occurs in the smallest nontrivial branching case.\n- For \u2113=3, Theorem A replaces 2k\u00b73^k by (3/2)k\u00b73^k, a 25% improvement in the additive term beyond f(k,h).\n- For large \u2113, Theorem A\u2019s additive term is \u2248 (1+1/(\u2113\u22121))k\u2113^k = (1+o(1))k\u2113^k, nearly halving the constant 2.\n- In Corollary A, replacing h=3k\u2113^{k+1} by h=k\u2113^{k+1}+2\u2113^k+\u2113 reduces h by a factor \u22483 for large \u2113 (and thus reduces f(k,h) significantly when f is increasing in h).\n\nObstacles\n\n- Further reducing the k-multiplicative loss in Theorem A requires a qualitatively new argument. The current lexicographic-layer method inherently sums a per-layer threshold T over up to k layers. Avoiding this additive accumulation would likely require a global matching/flow argument across all layers at once (e.g., Haxell-type demand matchings in suitable bipartite graphs) or a randomized nibble, but making such an approach robust to the anti-monotone \u201ccommon property\u201d constraint seems nontrivial.\n- Large improvements to the k=2 spider constant (3.56\u2026) appear to need a different counting scheme; the partition A\u222aB and 2-path double counting seems near its limit under this strategy.\n\nNext steps\n\n- Try to replace the layer-by-layer construction in Theorem A with a single multi-commodity flow on a directed auxiliary graph to get an O(\u2113^k) (not k\u2113^k) additive term. A plausible route is to encode the demand \u201ceach internal vertex needs \u2113 children\u201d as capacities and use a max-flow/min-cut argument.\n- Pursue k=3 of the Giant Spider: adapt the V\u2192B\u2192A path-counting to 3-step paths V\u2192B\u2192A\u2192A (or similar) and optimize a \u03c4-threshold partition to obtain \u03b4^+ \u2265 c\u00b7\u2113 with a concrete c<9, aiming for c\u22486.\n- Explore whether \u201ccentre of S^-_{k,h} avoiding a fixed forbidden set F\u201d is \u03b4^+-common with a linear overhead in |F|. If so, the h in Corollary A might be further reduced to k\u2113^{k+1} + O(\u2113^k) while keeping f(k,h+|F|) under control.\n- Investigate additional grounded families beyond Theorem 2.1 by allowing the minimal subtree on U to have at most one \u201cbackward\u201d edge per root-to-leaf path. A careful decomposition might combine Theorem A with a bounded number of extra local gadgets.\n"
