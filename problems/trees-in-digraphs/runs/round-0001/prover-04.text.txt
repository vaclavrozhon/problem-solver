Ideas

- Improve the constant 2 in Theorem 3.4 (Theorem outstar_with_leaves_property) to 1+1/(ℓ−1), keeping the same proof skeleton but tightening the greedy step that expands leaves.
- Sharpen the “packing rays” step in Theorem 3.3 (supergraph_of_normalized) by replacing h=3kℓ^{k+1} with h=kℓ^{k+1}+2ℓ^k+ℓ, which is asymptotically a factor-3 improvement in h. This reduces f(k,h) and thus the overall δ^+-bound quantitatively.
- Slightly tighten the constant in Theorem 4.1 (linear spiders for k=2) by using 2ℓ−1 instead of 2ℓ in one place of the proof; this gives a small improvement for finite ℓ.

Results and proofs

1) Improved outstar-with-leaves property

Theorem A (improves Theorem 3.4). Let ℘ be δ^+-common with threshold d(℘). Let k≥1, ℓ≥2. Define
T := ℓ^k + ⌈ℓ^k/(ℓ−1)⌉.
If δ^+(G) ≥ d(℘) + kT, then G contains a copy B of B^+_{k,ℓ} whose leaves satisfy ℘ in G.

Why this improves Theorem 3.4: The original used T=2ℓ^k and the bound d(℘)+2kℓ^k. Since T=ℓ^k+⌈ℓ^k/(ℓ−1)⌉ = (1+1/(ℓ−1))ℓ^k+O(1), the new bound is d(℘) + k(1+1/(ℓ−1))ℓ^k + O(k), which strictly improves 2kℓ^k for all ℓ≥3 (and matches it for ℓ=2).

Proof. We follow the original proof verbatim, redefining the sets Γ(i) as
- Γ(0) = {v : v satisfies ℘},
- Γ(i) = {v : deg^+_{Γ(i−1)}(v) ≥ T}, for i=1,…,k.
The lexicographic-minimal-vector argument (Claim 3.5) goes through unchanged with T in place of 2ℓ^k; the only place T is used is to sum the bounds deg^+_{Γ(i)}(v) < T for indices i with z_{i+1}=0, so that deg^+_W(v) < ∑_{i∈I}T ≤ kT. Thus, if δ^+(G) ≥ d(℘) + kT, we again get Γ(k)≠∅.

To perform the greedy construction B_0,…,B_k, the only needed adjustment is the expansion step B_i→B_{i+1} from leaves L⊆Γ(k−i). Each leaf w∈L needs ℓ new out-neighbours in Γ(k−i−1) that avoid V(B_i) and avoid choices made for earlier leaves in L. We use that |V(B_i)| ≤ ∑_{j=0}^i ℓ^j = (ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) ≤ ⌈ℓ^k/(ℓ−1)⌉ for i≤k−1, so for every leaf w
 deg^+_{Γ(k−i−1)\V(B_i)}(w) ≥ T − |V(B_i)| ≥ ℓ^k.
Now process the leaves in any order: when choosing for the r-th leaf, at most rℓ ≤ |L|ℓ ≤ ℓ^i·ℓ = ℓ^{i+1} ≤ ℓ^k neighbours have been reserved by previous leaves. Hence each leaf still has at least ℓ^k−ℓ^{i+1} ≥ ℓ available choices, so we can pick ℓ new, pairwise disjoint neighbours. This yields B_{i+1} with leaves in Γ(k−i−1). Iterating gives B_k with leaves in Γ(0), i.e., satisfying ℘. ∎

Corollary A (improves Theorem 3.3). Let k≥1, ℓ≥2 and put h := kℓ^{k+1}+2ℓ^k+ℓ. Then every digraph G with
 δ^+(G) ≥ f(k,h) + k(ℓ^k + ⌈ℓ^k/(ℓ−1)⌉)
contains T(k,ℓ) as a subgraph.

Proof. Take ℘ = “v is the centre of S^-_{k,h}”. By Proposition 3.2, ℘ is δ^+-common with d(℘)=f(k,h). Apply Theorem A to obtain an embedded B^+_{k,ℓ} whose leaves L (|L|=ℓ^k) each are centres of a copy S(w)≅S^-_{k,h}. We choose, greedily over w∈L, a substar S′(w)≅S^-_{k,ℓ} so that S′(w) is disjoint from B except at w, and so that all the S′(w) are pairwise disjoint. At the moment of choosing S′(w), the forbidden set has size at most |V(B)| + (number of previously chosen S′)·kℓ ≤ 2ℓ^k + (ℓ^k−1)kℓ < 2ℓ^k + kℓ^{k+1}. Since each vertex of S(w) lies on exactly one ray of S(w), a forbidden set of size F blocks at most F rays. Thus, with h ≥ (2ℓ^k + kℓ^{k+1}) + ℓ, there remain at least ℓ unblocked rays, enabling S′(w). ∎

Remark. The original choice h=3kℓ^{k+1} can be replaced by h=kℓ^{k+1}+2ℓ^k+ℓ. This materially improves the quantitative dependence on h in f(k,h).

2) Slight tightening for k=2 spiders

Theorem B (refines Theorem 4.1 slightly). For every ℓ≥1, if δ^+(G) > ((3+√(17−4/ℓ))/2)·ℓ, then G contains S^-_{2,ℓ}.

Proof. Repeat the proof of Theorem 4.1 verbatim, but note that for b∈B we have deg^−(b) ≤ 2ℓ−1 (strict inequality in the definition of B), so |V→S→{a}| ≤ (2ℓ−1)s rather than 2ℓs. This yields
 s ≥ d(d−2ℓ)/(d+2ℓ−1),
whence s>ℓ as soon as d satisfies
 d(d−2ℓ) > ℓ(d+2ℓ−1) ⇔ d > ((3+√(17−4/ℓ))/2)·ℓ.
For fixed ℓ this improves the constant slightly; asymptotically it matches (3+√17)/2. ∎

Examples and sanity checks

- For ℓ=2, Theorem A gives the same constant as the original (since 1+1/(ℓ−1)=2), so no loss occurs in the smallest nontrivial branching case.
- For ℓ=3, Theorem A replaces 2k·3^k by (3/2)k·3^k, a 25% improvement in the additive term beyond f(k,h).
- For large ℓ, Theorem A’s additive term is ≈ (1+1/(ℓ−1))kℓ^k = (1+o(1))kℓ^k, nearly halving the constant 2.
- In Corollary A, replacing h=3kℓ^{k+1} by h=kℓ^{k+1}+2ℓ^k+ℓ reduces h by a factor ≈3 for large ℓ (and thus reduces f(k,h) significantly when f is increasing in h).

Obstacles

- Further reducing the k-multiplicative loss in Theorem A requires a qualitatively new argument. The current lexicographic-layer method inherently sums a per-layer threshold T over up to k layers. Avoiding this additive accumulation would likely require a global matching/flow argument across all layers at once (e.g., Haxell-type demand matchings in suitable bipartite graphs) or a randomized nibble, but making such an approach robust to the anti-monotone “common property” constraint seems nontrivial.
- Large improvements to the k=2 spider constant (3.56…) appear to need a different counting scheme; the partition A∪B and 2-path double counting seems near its limit under this strategy.

Next steps

- Try to replace the layer-by-layer construction in Theorem A with a single multi-commodity flow on a directed auxiliary graph to get an O(ℓ^k) (not kℓ^k) additive term. A plausible route is to encode the demand “each internal vertex needs ℓ children” as capacities and use a max-flow/min-cut argument.
- Pursue k=3 of the Giant Spider: adapt the V→B→A path-counting to 3-step paths V→B→A→A (or similar) and optimize a τ-threshold partition to obtain δ^+ ≥ c·ℓ with a concrete c<9, aiming for c≈6.
- Explore whether “centre of S^-_{k,h} avoiding a fixed forbidden set F” is δ^+-common with a linear overhead in |F|. If so, the h in Corollary A might be further reduced to kℓ^{k+1} + O(ℓ^k) while keeping f(k,h+|F|) under control.
- Investigate additional grounded families beyond Theorem 2.1 by allowing the minimal subtree on U to have at most one “backward” edge per root-to-leaf path. A careful decomposition might combine Theorem A with a bounded number of extra local gadgets.
