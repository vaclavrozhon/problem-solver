Refinements and fixes to the paper's results. A level-dependent threshold schedule t_{k-i}=ℓ^{i+1}+⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉ gives S_{k,ℓ}=∑_i t_i=Θ(ℓ^k) (specifically S_{k,ℓ} ≤ (2ℓ/(ℓ−1))·ℓ^k+ℓ), so δ^+(G) ≥ d(P)+S_{k,ℓ} guarantees a B^+_{k,ℓ} whose leaves satisfy any δ^+-common property P (improving Theorem 3.4). A ray-packing lemma shows one can extract disjoint S^-_{k,ℓ} at the ℓ^k leaves when h ≥ |V(B)|+kℓ|L|+ℓ, giving h = kℓ^{k+1}+2ℓ^k+ℓ (improving Theorem 3.6) and hence δ^+ ≥ f(k,h)+S_{k,ℓ} ⇒ T(k,ℓ). For k=2, the linear bound is corrected and sharpened: counting 2-walks plus a maximum-matching argument yields s ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1)/(d+2ℓ−1) and so S^-_{2,ℓ} appears when d > d_*(ℓ)=((3ℓ−1)+√(17ℓ^2−10ℓ+1))/2, fixing a gap in the original proof. Next steps target global selection/packing and better bounds on f(k,h). Citations: papers/paper1.txt
