The most impactful advance is Prover 2\u2019s non-uniform threshold schedule for Theorem 3.4/3.5 (outstar-with-leaves for a \u03b4+-common property): replacing the uniform 2\u2113^k (summed k times) by a level-dependent choice t_{k-i}=\u2113^{i+1}+\u2308(\u2113^{i+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121)\u2309. The sum S_{k,\u2113}=\u2211 t_i is \u0398(\u2113^k) (independent of k), which strictly improves the paper\u2019s additive 2k\u2113^k term. The standard lexicographic partition argument and the greedy extension both remain valid with these thresholds and are presented cleanly. This dominates the uniform-threshold refinements suggested by Provers 1 and 3 (which still cost k\u00b7T*). \\n\\nOn the \u201cdisjoint rays\u201d extraction, both Provers 1,2,3,4 give the same bound h \u2265 k\u2113^{k+1}+2\u2113^k+\u2113.

This is a factor-\u22483 improvement over the paper\u2019s 3k\u2113^{k+1}.

If some r\u2208A has deg^-_A(r) \u2265 2\u2113, the greedy construction yields S^-_{2,\u2113}. Otherwise, assume deg^-_A(\u00b7) \u2264 2\u2113\u22121 on A.\\nCount directed 2-walks. Let X\u21d2Y\u21d2Z be the set of 2-walks with middle in Y and end in Z. Then\\n |V\u21d2B\u21d2A| = |A\u21d2V\u21d2V| \u2212 |A\u21d2A\u21d2V| + |B\u21d2B\u21d2V| \u2212 |V\u21d2B\u21d2B|.\\nUsing deg^+(\u00b7)=d, deg^-_A\u22642\u2113\u22121 on A, and deg^\u2212(b)\u22642\u2113\u22121 on B,\\n |A\u21d2V\u21d2V| = |A| d^2,\\n |A\u21d2A\u21d2V| \u2264 e(G[A]) d \u2264 (2\u2113\u22121) d |A|,\\n |B\u21d2B\u21d2V| = e(G[B]) d,\\n |V\u21d2B\u21d2B| \u2264 (2\u2113\u22121) e(G[B]).\\nThus |V\u21d2B\u21d2A| \u2265 |A| d(d\u22122\u2113+1). Hence there is a\u2208A with |V\u21d2B\u21d2{a}| \u2265 d(d\u22122\u2113+1).\\nForm the bipartite graph H with left L:=V\\\\{a} and right Y:=N^-_B(a), and put an edge (q,b)\u2208L\u00d7Y iff (q,b)\u2208E(G). Each edge of H corresponds to a 2-walk q\u2192b\u2192a. Let M be a maximum matching of H with size s; write Q and S for its left and right endpoints. The 2-walks using b\u2208S are at most \u2211_{b\u2208S}deg^\u2212(b) \u2264 (2\u2113\u22121)s. By maximality, there is no edge joining an unmatched left vertex to an unmatched right vertex; hence every 2-walk via B\\\\S starts in Q, contributing at most d|Q|=ds walks. Therefore\\n d(d\u22122\u2113+1) \u2264 |V\u21d2B\u21d2{a}| \u2264 ds + (2\u2113\u22121)s = s(d+2\u2113\u22121),\\nso s \u2265 d(d\u22122\u2113+1)/(d+2\u2113\u22121). If s \u2265 \u2113, we obtain S^-_{2,\u2113}. Solving s \u2265 \u2113 gives d > d_*(\u2113). \u220e\"},\"output_update\":{\"action\":\"append\",\"content\":\"New Main Results\\n\\n- Refined outstar-with-\u03b4+-common-leaves (improves Theorem 3.4): For \u2113\u22652, k\u22651, and any \u03b4+-common property P with threshold d(P), if \u03b4^+(G) \u2265 d(P)+S_{k,\u2113}, where S_{k,\u2113}=\u0398(\u2113^k) is independent of k (specifically, S_{k,\u2113} \u2264 (2\u2113/(\u2113\u22121))\u00b7\u2113^k+\u2113), then G contains B^+_{k,\u2113} whose leaves all satisfy P.\\n\\n- Improved packing of in-spiders at the leaves (improves Theorem 3.6): It suffices to take h = k\u2113^{k+1}+2\u2113^k+\u2113 (instead of 3k\u2113^{k+1}). Consequently, \u03b4^+(G) \u2265 f(k,h)+S_{k,\u2113} guarantees a copy of T(k,\u2113).\\n\\n- k=2 Giant Spiders: Any digraph with \u03b4^+ > ((3\u2113\u22121)+\u221a(17\u2113^2\u221210\u2113+1))/2 contains S^-_{2,\u2113}. This corrects and strengthens the linear bound proof by replacing a flawed maximality step with a maximum-matching argument and counting 2-walks instead of 2-paths.\"}}",
