- Refined outstar-with-δ+-common-leaves (improves Theorem 3.4): For ℓ≥2, k≥1, and any δ+-common property P with threshold d(P), if δ^+(G) ≥ d(P)+S_{k,ℓ}, where S_{k,ℓ}=Θ(ℓ^k) is independent of k (specifically, S_{k,ℓ} ≤ (2ℓ/(ℓ−1))·ℓ^k+ℓ), then G contains B^+_{k,ℓ} whose leaves all satisfy P.

- Improved packing of in-spiders at the leaves (improves Theorem 3.6): It suffices to take h = kℓ^{k+1}+2ℓ^k+ℓ (instead of 3kℓ^{k+1}). Consequently, δ^+(G) ≥ f(k,h)+S_{k,ℓ} guarantees a copy of T(k,ℓ).

- k=2 Giant Spiders: Any digraph with δ^+ > ((3ℓ−1)+√(17ℓ^2−10ℓ+1))/2 contains S^-_{2,ℓ}. This corrects and strengthens the linear bound proof by replacing a flawed maximality step with a maximum-matching argument and counting 2-walks instead of 2-paths.
