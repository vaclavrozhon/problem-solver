The lexicographic partition argument from the paper adapts verbatim with the thresholds t_j: for contradiction assume \u0393(k)=\u2205; let z be the lexicographically minimal nonempty class V_z with z_k=0; put I = {i \u2208 {0,\u2026,k\u22121}: z_{i+1}=0} and W = \u22c3_{i\u2208I} \u0393(i).

If z = 0\u20d7, then for all v \u2208 X := V\\\\\u22c3_{j=0}^k \u0393(j) we have deg^+_X(v) \u2265 \u03b4^+(G) \u2212 S_{k,\u2113} \u2265 d(\u03a0), whence X contains a \u03a0-vertex, contradiction to anti-monotonicity (Definition 3.3). Hence \u0393(k) \u2260 \u2205.\\n\\nTake v \u2208 \u0393(k) and build B greedily. For each i=0,\u2026,k\u22121, suppose we have B_i \u2245 B^+_{i,\u2113} with leaves L_i \u2286 \u0393(k\u2212i) and |V(B_i)| = (\u2113^{i+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121), |L_i| = \u2113^i. To extend to B_{i+1}, for each w \u2208 L_i we must pick \u2113 new children in \u0393(k\u2212i\u22121) outside V(B_i) and disjoint across L_i. Greedily ordering the leaves, when treating the j-th leaf, at most |V(B_i)| + \u2113(j\u22121) of its neighbours are forbidden. Thus it suffices that every w \u2208 L_i satisfies deg^+_{\u0393(k\u2212i\u22121)}(w) \u2265 |V(B_i)| + \u2113|L_i| = (\u2113^{i+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121) + \u2113^{i+1}. Exactly t_{k\u2212i} meets this. Hence B_k exists with leaves in \u0393(0), i.e., all leaves satisfy \u03a0.\\n\\nExplicit bound for S_{k,\u2113}.

Let h* := (\u2113^{k+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121) + k\u2113^{k+1} + \u2113. If \u03b4^+(G) \u2265 f(k,h*) + S_{k,\u2113}, then G contains T(k,\u2113).\\n\\nProof. Take \u03a0 = \u201cis the centre of S^-_{k,h*}\u201d. By Proposition 3.5, \u03a0 is \u03b4^+-common with threshold d(\u03a0)=f(k,h*). Theorem 1 yields B \u2245 B^+_{k,\u2113} with leaves L (|L|=\u2113^k), each the centre of S(w) \u2245 S^-_{k,h*}. Proceed greedily over L: when selecting S\u2032(w) \u2245 S^-_{k,\u2113}, each previously used vertex blocks at most one ray in S(w); at each step, the union U of B and selected S\u2032 contains at most |V(B)| + k\u2113(|L|\u22121) \u2264 (\u2113^{k+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121) + k\u2113^{k+1} \u2212 k\u2113 vertices. If h* \u2265 |U| + \u2113, then at least \u2113 unblocked rays remain. This is ensured by the definition of h*. Thus the S\u2032(w) can be chosen pairwise disjoint and internally disjoint from B, yielding T(k,\u2113).\\n\\nTheorem 3 (Linear bound for S^-_{2,\u2113} via 2-walks and a vertex cover). For every \u2113 \u2265 1, any digraph G with minimum out-degree d > d_2(\u2113) := ((2\u2113\u22121)+\u221a(12\u2113^2\u22128\u2113+1))/2 contains S^-_{2,\u2113} as a subgraph.\\n\\nProof. Assume by edge deletions that deg^+(v)=d for all v. Partition V into A := {v: deg^\u2212(v) \u2265 2\u2113} and B := V\\\\A, so A \u2260 \u2205. If some r \u2208 A has deg^-_A(r) \u2265 2\u2113 we greedily embed S^-_{2,\u2113} as in the paper. Otherwise deg^-_A(v) \u2264 2\u2113\u22121 for all v \u2208 A.\\nCount directed 2-walks V \u21d2 B \u21d2 A:\\n|A \u21d2 V \u21d2 V| = |A| d^2,\\n|A \u21d2 A \u21d2 V| \u2264 d e(G[A]) \u2264 (2\u2113\u22121)d|A|,\\n|B \u21d2 B \u21d2 V| = d e(G[B]),\\n|V \u21d2 B \u21d2 B| \u2264 (2\u2113\u22121) e(G[B]).\\nHence |V \u21d2 B \u21d2 A| \u2265 |A| d(d\u22122\u2113+1) + e(G[B])(d\u22122\u2113+1) \u2265 |A| d(d\u22122\u2113+1).\\nChoose a \u2208 A so that |V \u21d2 B \u21d2 {a}| \u2265 d(d\u22122\u2113+1). Let R := N^-_B(a), U := V\\\\{a}, and form the bipartite graph H with parts (U,R) and edges q\u2014b iff (q,b) \u2208 E. Every edge of H corresponds to a distinct 2-walk q\u2192b\u2192a. Let M be a maximum matching in H, s := |M|, and C a minimum vertex cover (K\u0151nig\u2019s theorem) with |C|=s, decomposed as C = Q \u2294 R_C with Q \u2286 U and R_C \u2286 R. Since every edge meets C,\\n|E(H)| \u2264 \u2211_{q\u2208Q} deg^+(q) + \u2211_{b\u2208R_C} deg^\u2212(b) \u2264 d|Q| + (2\u2113\u22121)|R_C| \u2264 (d+2\u2113\u22121)s.\\nThus d(d\u22122\u2113+1) \u2264 |E(H)| \u2264 (d+2\u2113\u22121)s, so s \u2265 d(d\u22122\u2113+1)/(d+2\u2113\u22121). If s \u2265 \u2113 then the matched pairs {(q_i,b_i)} give S^-_{2,\u2113}. Solving s \u2265 \u2113 yields the claimed threshold d > d_2(\u2113).\\n\\nExamples/checks\\n\\n- For \u2113=2, Theorem 3 gives d \u2265 5 (since (3+\u221a33)/2 \u2248 4.87), strictly better than \u22487.12 from the paper. The Giant Spider Conjecture predicts the optimal threshold 2\u2113=4, so there is still room.\\n- For \u2113=1 (paths of length 2), the bound d > (1+\u221a5)/2 \u2248 1.618 is non-tight (d \u2265 1 suffices), but the argument is uniform and correct.\\n\\nObstacles\\n\\n- The \u0393-scheme with variable thresholds is essentially tight for greedy extension at depth i: t_{k\u2212i} must dominate |V(B_i)| + \u2113|L_i|. Improving S_{k,\u2113} further likely needs a simultaneous b-matching across leaves (nibble), which requires codegree control we do not have in general digraphs.\\n- The ray packing bound h* is tight up to lower-order terms in \u2113^k under greedy selection. A global packing of rays could in principle reduce the additive (\u2113^{k+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121) term, but again needs extra pseudorandomness.\\n\\nNext steps\\n\\n- Attempt a global b-matching for children selection at each level to reduce t_{k\u2212i} from |V(B_i)|+\u2113^{i+1} toward (1+o(1))\u2113^{i+1}, aiming for S_{k,\u2113} = (1+o_\u2113(1))\u2113^k.\\n- Explore randomized nibble for ray packing to reduce h* to (1+o(1))k\u2113^{k+1}.\\n- Seek improved d(\u03a0)=f(k,h) for \u03a0=\u201ccentre of S^-_{k,h}\u201d, even polynomial in h, to substantially sharpen \u03b4^+ thresholds in Corollary 2.\\n\"}",
