Ideas

- Replace the uniform 2ℓ^k-thresholds in Theorem 3.4/3.7 by a level-dependent schedule t_{k−i} = ℓ^{i+1} + ⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉. This makes the total additive overhead S_{k,ℓ} = ∑_{j=1}^k t_j = Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k) independent of k. I give a fully rigorous variable-threshold Γ-scheme and compute a clean explicit bound S_{k,ℓ} ≤ ℓ(ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ)/(ℓ−1)^2 + ((ℓ−2)/(ℓ−1))k.
- Refine the ray-packing bound for h: h ≥ |V(B^+_{k,ℓ})| + kℓ|L| + ℓ = (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + kℓ^{k+1} + ℓ (improving the paper’s 3kℓ^{k+1} and the 2ℓ^k coarse term by the exact |V(B)|).
- Strengthen the k=2 spider bound: using 2-walks and a minimum vertex cover (via Kőnig’s theorem) in the predecessor bipartite graph yields s ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1)/(d+2ℓ−1), hence S^-_{2,ℓ} appears for d > ((2ℓ−1)+√(12ℓ^2−8ℓ+1))/2 ≈ (1+√3)ℓ ≈ 2.732ℓ, strictly improving the paper’s ≈3.56ℓ.

Results and proofs

Theorem 1 (Outstar with δ^+-common leaves; variable thresholds). Let Π be a δ^+-common vertex property with threshold d(Π). Fix ℓ ≥ 2 and k ≥ 1. Define
- Γ(0) = {v: v has Π},
- for 1 ≤ j ≤ k, Γ(j) = {v: deg^+_{Γ(j−1)}(v) ≥ t_j}, where t_{k−i} := ℓ^{i+1} + ⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉ for i = 0,1,…,k−1.
If δ^+(G) ≥ d(Π) + S_{k,ℓ} with S_{k,ℓ} := ∑_{j=1}^k t_j, then G contains B ≅ B^+_{k,ℓ} whose leaves all satisfy Π.

Proof. The lexicographic partition argument from the paper adapts verbatim with the thresholds t_j: for contradiction assume Γ(k)=∅; let z be the lexicographically minimal nonempty class V_z with z_k=0; put I = {i ∈ {0,…,k−1}: z_{i+1}=0} and W = ⋃_{i∈I} Γ(i). Then any v ∈ V_z has deg^+_W(v) < ∑_{i∈I} t_{i+1} ≤ ∑_{j=1}^k t_j = S_{k,ℓ}. If z ≠ 0⃗ this contradicts δ^+(G) ≥ S_{k,ℓ}. If z = 0⃗, then for all v ∈ X := V\⋃_{j=0}^k Γ(j) we have deg^+_X(v) ≥ δ^+(G) − S_{k,ℓ} ≥ d(Π), whence X contains a Π-vertex, contradiction to anti-monotonicity (Definition 3.3). Hence Γ(k) ≠ ∅.

Take v ∈ Γ(k) and build B greedily. For each i=0,…,k−1, suppose we have B_i ≅ B^+_{i,ℓ} with leaves L_i ⊆ Γ(k−i) and |V(B_i)| = (ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1), |L_i| = ℓ^i. To extend to B_{i+1}, for each w ∈ L_i we must pick ℓ new children in Γ(k−i−1) outside V(B_i) and disjoint across L_i. Greedily ordering the leaves, when treating the j-th leaf, at most |V(B_i)| + ℓ(j−1) of its neighbours are forbidden. Thus it suffices that every w ∈ L_i satisfies deg^+_{Γ(k−i−1)}(w) ≥ |V(B_i)| + ℓ|L_i| = (ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ^{i+1}. Exactly t_{k−i} meets this. Hence B_k exists with leaves in Γ(0), i.e., all leaves satisfy Π.

Explicit bound for S_{k,ℓ}. Using ⌈x⌉ ≤ x+1,
S_{k,ℓ} = ∑_{r=1}^k (ℓ^r + ⌈(ℓ^r−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉)
≤ ∑_{r=1}^k ℓ^r + (1/(ℓ−1))∑_{r=1}^k (ℓ^r − 1) + k
= (1 + 1/(ℓ−1)) · (ℓ^{k+1} − ℓ)/(ℓ−1) − k/(ℓ−1) + k
= ℓ(ℓ^{k+1} − ℓ)/(ℓ−1)^2 + ((ℓ−2)/(ℓ−1))k.
In particular, S_{k,ℓ} = (ℓ^2/(ℓ−1)^2)ℓ^k + O_ℓ(1), independent of k up to a constant depending only on ℓ.

Corollary 2 (T(k,ℓ) with refined h and S_{k,ℓ}). Let h* := (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + kℓ^{k+1} + ℓ. If δ^+(G) ≥ f(k,h*) + S_{k,ℓ}, then G contains T(k,ℓ).

Proof. Take Π = “is the centre of S^-_{k,h*}”. By Proposition 3.5, Π is δ^+-common with threshold d(Π)=f(k,h*). Theorem 1 yields B ≅ B^+_{k,ℓ} with leaves L (|L|=ℓ^k), each the centre of S(w) ≅ S^-_{k,h*}. Proceed greedily over L: when selecting S′(w) ≅ S^-_{k,ℓ}, each previously used vertex blocks at most one ray in S(w); at each step, the union U of B and selected S′ contains at most |V(B)| + kℓ(|L|−1) ≤ (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + kℓ^{k+1} − kℓ vertices. If h* ≥ |U| + ℓ, then at least ℓ unblocked rays remain. This is ensured by the definition of h*. Thus the S′(w) can be chosen pairwise disjoint and internally disjoint from B, yielding T(k,ℓ).

Theorem 3 (Linear bound for S^-_{2,ℓ} via 2-walks and a vertex cover). For every ℓ ≥ 1, any digraph G with minimum out-degree d > d_2(ℓ) := ((2ℓ−1)+√(12ℓ^2−8ℓ+1))/2 contains S^-_{2,ℓ} as a subgraph.

Proof. Assume by edge deletions that deg^+(v)=d for all v. Partition V into A := {v: deg^−(v) ≥ 2ℓ} and B := V\A, so A ≠ ∅. If some r ∈ A has deg^-_A(r) ≥ 2ℓ we greedily embed S^-_{2,ℓ} as in the paper. Otherwise deg^-_A(v) ≤ 2ℓ−1 for all v ∈ A.
Count directed 2-walks V ⇒ B ⇒ A:
|A ⇒ V ⇒ V| = |A| d^2,
|A ⇒ A ⇒ V| ≤ d e(G[A]) ≤ (2ℓ−1)d|A|,
|B ⇒ B ⇒ V| = d e(G[B]),
|V ⇒ B ⇒ B| ≤ (2ℓ−1) e(G[B]).
Hence |V ⇒ B ⇒ A| ≥ |A| d(d−2ℓ+1) + e(G[B])(d−2ℓ+1) ≥ |A| d(d−2ℓ+1).
Choose a ∈ A so that |V ⇒ B ⇒ {a}| ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1). Let R := N^-_B(a), U := V\{a}, and form the bipartite graph H with parts (U,R) and edges q—b iff (q,b) ∈ E. Every edge of H corresponds to a distinct 2-walk q→b→a. Let M be a maximum matching in H, s := |M|, and C a minimum vertex cover (Kőnig’s theorem) with |C|=s, decomposed as C = Q ⊔ R_C with Q ⊆ U and R_C ⊆ R. Since every edge meets C,
|E(H)| ≤ ∑_{q∈Q} deg^+(q) + ∑_{b∈R_C} deg^−(b) ≤ d|Q| + (2ℓ−1)|R_C| ≤ (d+2ℓ−1)s.
Thus d(d−2ℓ+1) ≤ |E(H)| ≤ (d+2ℓ−1)s, so s ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1)/(d+2ℓ−1). If s ≥ ℓ then the matched pairs {(q_i,b_i)} give S^-_{2,ℓ}. Solving s ≥ ℓ yields the claimed threshold d > d_2(ℓ).

Examples/checks

- For ℓ=2, Theorem 3 gives d ≥ 5 (since (3+√33)/2 ≈ 4.87), strictly better than ≈7.12 from the paper. The Giant Spider Conjecture predicts the optimal threshold 2ℓ=4, so there is still room.
- For ℓ=1 (paths of length 2), the bound d > (1+√5)/2 ≈ 1.618 is non-tight (d ≥ 1 suffices), but the argument is uniform and correct.

Obstacles

- The Γ-scheme with variable thresholds is essentially tight for greedy extension at depth i: t_{k−i} must dominate |V(B_i)| + ℓ|L_i|. Improving S_{k,ℓ} further likely needs a simultaneous b-matching across leaves (nibble), which requires codegree control we do not have in general digraphs.
- The ray packing bound h* is tight up to lower-order terms in ℓ^k under greedy selection. A global packing of rays could in principle reduce the additive (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) term, but again needs extra pseudorandomness.

Next steps

- Attempt a global b-matching for children selection at each level to reduce t_{k−i} from |V(B_i)|+ℓ^{i+1} toward (1+o(1))ℓ^{i+1}, aiming for S_{k,ℓ} = (1+o_ℓ(1))ℓ^k.
- Explore randomized nibble for ray packing to reduce h* to (1+o(1))kℓ^{k+1}.
- Seek improved d(Π)=f(k,h) for Π=“centre of S^-_{k,h}”, even polynomial in h, to substantially sharpen δ^+ thresholds in Corollary 2.
