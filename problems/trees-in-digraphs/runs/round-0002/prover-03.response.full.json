This removes the linear-in-k factor from the additive \u03b4+ term, replacing 2k\u2113^k by a sum S_{k,\u2113} = \u0398(\u2113^{k+1}) (hence no factor k), and yields a clean, auditable computation.\\n- Give a careful ray-packing lemma to reduce the h used in T(k,\u2113)-embedding to h* = k\u2113^{k+1} + 2\u2113^k + \u2113, improving 3k\u2113^{k+1}.\\n- Repair the k = 2 spider proof via a maximum matching argument in the predecessor bipartite graph to establish a rigorous linear bound close to (3+\u221a17)/2 \u00b7 \u2113.\\n\\nResult A (variable-threshold outstar with \u03b4+-common leaves)\\n\\nStatement. Let \u2113 \u2265 2, k \u2265 1, and P be a \u03b4+-common property with threshold d(P). Define \u0393(0) = {v : v satisfies P}.

Writing |V(B_i)| = 1 + \u2113 + \u2026 + \u2113^i = (\u2113^{i+1} \u2212 1)/(\u2113 \u2212 1), we compute\\nS_{k,\u2113} = \u2211_{i=0}^{k\u22121} [\u2113^{i+1} + (\u2113^{i+1} \u2212 1)/(\u2113 \u2212 1)]\\n= (\u2113^{k+1} \u2212 \u2113)/(\u2113 \u2212 1) + (\u2113^{k+1} \u2212 \u2113)/(\u2113 \u2212 1)^2 \u2212 k/(\u2113 \u2212 1)\\n\u2264 (\u2113/(\u2113 \u2212 1)^2) \u00b7 \u2113^{k+1}.\\nIn particular, the additive \u03b4+ term is \u0398(\u2113^{k+1}), with no linear factor k.\\n\\nProof (sketch with checkable steps).\\n- Non-emptiness of \u0393(k): Use the same lexicographic partition z(v) \u2208 {0,1}^{k+1} and W = \u22c3_{i: z_{i+1}=0} \u0393(i) as in the paper. If \u0393(k) = \u2205, pick z minimal with V_z \u2260 \u2205. For v \u2208 V_z, for each i with z_{i+1} = 0, we have v \u2209 \u0393(i+1), hence deg^+_{\u0393(i)}(v) < t_{i+1}. Summing over i gives deg^+_W(v) < \u2211_{i\u2208I} t_{i+1} \u2264 S_{k,\u2113}. If z \u2260 0, then W = V and \u03b4^+(G) \u2264 deg^+_W(v) < S_{k,\u2113}, contradicting \u03b4^+(G) \u2265 d(P) + S_{k,\u2113}. If z = 0, then for any v \u2208 X = V_{0}, deg^+_X(v) \u2265 \u03b4^+(G) \u2212 S_{k,\u2113} \u2265 d(P); by antimonotonicity, \u0393(0) \u2260 \u2205, contradicting z = 0. So \u0393(k) \u2260 \u2205.\\n- Greedy construction of B: start from v \u2208 \u0393(k) and build B_i inductively. At stage i, the set of leaves L has size |L| = \u2113^i and lies in \u0393(k\u2212i). For w \u2208 L, since w \u2208 \u0393(k\u2212i), deg^+_{\u0393(k\u2212i\u22121)}(w) \u2265 t_{i+1} = \u2113^{i+1} + |V(B_i)|. After excluding the |V(B_i)| used vertices, each w has at least \u2113^{i+1} available neighbours in \u0393(k\u2212i\u22121) \\\\ V(B_i). A simple packing (place \u2113 children per w, processing the w\u2019s arbitrarily) succeeds because when placing the j-th \u2113-set, at most (j\u22121)\u2113 \u2264 \u2113^{i+1} \u2212 \u2113 of the available neighbours are already used, leaving \u2265 \u2113 fresh choices. Thus B_{i+1} exists with leaves in \u0393(k\u2212i\u22121). After k steps, B_k = B has leaves in \u0393(0), i.e., all leaves satisfy P in G.\\n\\nLemma B (ray packing for T(k,\u2113))\\n\\nStatement. Let L be a set of \u2113^k vertices, and for each w \u2208 L let S(w) \u2245 S^-_{k,h} be a spider whose center is w. Suppose we have a fixed copy B \u2245 B^+_{k,\u2113} with leaf set L. If\\nh \u2265 |V(B)| + (|L|\u22121)\u00b7k\u2113 + \u2113,\\nthen one can choose subspiders S\u2032(w) \u2286 S(w), each isomorphic to S^-_{k,\u2113}, such that the S\u2032(w) are pairwise vertex-disjoint and disjoint from B except at their centers.\\n\\nProof. Process w \u2208 L arbitrarily. At the moment of choosing S\u2032(w), the occupied vertices lie in B and in at most |L|\u22121 previously chosen S\u2032(\u00b7). Inside S(w), any vertex besides w lies on exactly one ray; hence each occupied vertex blocks at most one ray of S(w). Since |V(B)| \u2264 (\u2113^{k+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121) \u2264 2\u2113^k for \u2113 \u2265 2, and each chosen S\u2032(\u00b7) contributes k\u2113 non-centers, at most |V(B)| + (|L|\u22121)\u00b7k\u2113 rays are blocked. If h \u2265 |V(B)| + (|L|\u22121)\u00b7k\u2113 + \u2113, then at least \u2113 rays remain to form S\u2032(w). Disjointness follows by construction.\\n\\nCorollary C (quantitative T(k,\u2113)-embedding). Let h* := k\u2113^{k+1} + 2\u2113^k + \u2113. If G has \u03b4^+(G) \u2265 f(k,h*) + S_{k,\u2113}, then G contains T(k,\u2113). Proof: apply Result A with P = \u201ccenter of S^-_{k,h*}\u201d, then Lemma B with |L| = \u2113^k and |V(B)| \u2264 2\u2113^k.\\n\\nResult D (k = 2 spiders via maximum matching)\\n\\nStatement. Let \u2113 \u2265 1 and G be a digraph with \u03b4^+(G) = d. Then there is a vertex a with\\n|{2-paths V \u2192 B \u2192 a}| \u2265 d(d \u2212 2\u2113),\\nwhere B = {v : deg^-(v) < 2\u2113}. For such a, let Y = N^-_B(a) and form the bipartite graph H between U = V \\\\ {a} and Y with edge set {q \u2208 U \u2192 b \u2208 Y in G}. Let s be the size of a maximum matching in H. Then\\ns \u2265 d(d \u2212 2\u2113 \u2212 1)/(d + 2\u2113 \u2212 1).\\nIn particular, if d satisfies d(d \u2212 2\u2113 \u2212 1) \u2265 \u2113(d + 2\u2113 \u2212 1), then G contains S^-_{2,\u2113}.\\n\\nProof. The lower bound |V \u2192 B \u2192 {a}| \u2265 d(d \u2212 2\u2113) is the paper\u2019s inequality (averaging over a \u2208 A). Every 2-path V \u2192 Y \u2192 a is of the form q \u2192 b \u2192 a with q \u2208 V, b \u2208 Y, so the total count W_total equals e(H) + deg^+_Y(a). By maximality of the matching M of size s, if Q \u2286 U and S \u2286 Y are the vertices of U,Y covered by M, then there are no edges between (U \\\\ Q) and (Y \\\\ S). Hence the total number of edges from U into Y \\\\ S is at most \u2211_{q\u2208Q} deg^+(q) \u2264 s d. Also the number of edges from U into S is at most \u2211_{b\u2208S} deg^-(b) \u2264 (2\u2113 \u2212 1)s since S \u2286 B. Therefore\\nW_total \u2264 s d + (2\u2113 \u2212 1)s + deg^+_Y(a) \u2264 s(d + 2\u2113 \u2212 1) + d.\\nCombining with W_total \u2265 d(d \u2212 2\u2113) gives s \u2265 [d(d \u2212 2\u2113) \u2212 d]/(d + 2\u2113 \u2212 1) = d(d \u2212 2\u2113 \u2212 1)/(d + 2\u2113 \u2212 1). Finally, any maximum matching of size s yields S^-_{2,s} by orienting q_i \u2192 b_i \u2192 a along the matching edges and the arcs b_i \u2192 a.\\n\\nConsequences. Solving s \u2265 \u2113 gives the quadratic\\nd^2 \u2212 (2\u2113 + 1)d \u2212 \u2113(2\u2113 \u2212 1) \u2265 0,\\nwhose positive root is d \u2265 ((3\u2113 + 1) + \u221a(17\u2113^2 + 2\u2113 + 1))/2 = ((3 + \u221a17)/2)\u2113 + O(1). Thus this reasoning recovers a linear bound of the same asymptotic constant as in the paper, with a rigorous matching-based proof.\\n\\nExamples and checks\\n\\n- For \u2113 = 2 and k arbitrary, S_{k,2} \u2264 (2/(1)^2)\u00b72^{k+1} = 2^{k+2} = 4\u00b72^k, improving the paper\u2019s additive 2k\u00b72^k.\\n- Lemma B: For k = 1, B is an out-star of size \u2113+1 and |V(B)| = \u2113+1 \u2264 2\u2113; h* = \u2113 + 2\u2113 + \u2113 = 4\u2113 suffices to pick \u2113 disjoint edges per center, consistent with the simple disjointness requirement.\\n\\nObstacles\\n\\n- Pushing S_{k,\u2113} below \u0398(\u2113^{k+1}) in the abstract \u03b4+-common framework seems impossible by greedy alone: at depth i, one must reserve \u2113^{i+1} distinct children for \u2113^i leaves, imposing a per-level cost that sums to \u0398(\u2113^{k+1}). Sharper constants may require a global semi-random selection across levels.\\n- For k = 2 spiders, the matching bound above essentially saturates the available degree information; improving the ~3.56 constant plausibly needs additional structure (e.g., strong restrictions on 2-cycles or better lower bounds on |V \u2192 B \u2192 a|).\\n\\nNext steps\\n\\n- Attempt a semi-random (nibble) selection across all frontier leaves at each level to replace the per-vertex requirement deg \u2265 \u2113^{i+1} + |V(B_i)| by (1+\u03b5)\u2113^{i+1} + o(\u2113^{i+1}), shaving constants in S_{k,\u2113}.\\n- Globalize ray packing: process S(w) in random order and assign rays via a matching in an auxiliary k-uniform hypergraph; Pippenger\u2013Spencer-type results may reduce h from k\u2113^{k+1} + O(\u2113^k) to (1+o(1))k\u2113^{k+1} with explicit o(1).\\n- Investigate f(k,h) from Aboulker et al.: any polynomial bound in h (for fixed k) would make the reductions above quantitatively impactful for T(k,\u2113)-embedding.\\n\"}",
