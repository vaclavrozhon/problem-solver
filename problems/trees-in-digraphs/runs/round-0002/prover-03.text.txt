Ideas

- Refine the “outstar with δ+-common leaves” theorem by using level-dependent thresholds t_i tuned to the actual deficit at stage i. This removes the linear-in-k factor from the additive δ+ term, replacing 2kℓ^k by a sum S_{k,ℓ} = Θ(ℓ^{k+1}) (hence no factor k), and yields a clean, auditable computation.
- Give a careful ray-packing lemma to reduce the h used in T(k,ℓ)-embedding to h* = kℓ^{k+1} + 2ℓ^k + ℓ, improving 3kℓ^{k+1}.
- Repair the k = 2 spider proof via a maximum matching argument in the predecessor bipartite graph to establish a rigorous linear bound close to (3+√17)/2 · ℓ.

Result A (variable-threshold outstar with δ+-common leaves)

Statement. Let ℓ ≥ 2, k ≥ 1, and P be a δ+-common property with threshold d(P). Define Γ(0) = {v : v satisfies P}. For i = 1,…,k set
- t_i := ℓ^{k−i+1} + (ℓ^{k−i+1} − 1)/(ℓ − 1),
- Γ(i) := {v : deg^+_{Γ(i−1)}(v) ≥ t_i}.
Let S_{k,ℓ} := ∑_{i=1}^k t_i. If δ^+(G) ≥ d(P) + S_{k,ℓ}, then G contains a copy B of B^+_{k,ℓ} such that all leaves of B satisfy P in G.

Quantitative bound. Writing |V(B_i)| = 1 + ℓ + … + ℓ^i = (ℓ^{i+1} − 1)/(ℓ − 1), we compute
S_{k,ℓ} = ∑_{i=0}^{k−1} [ℓ^{i+1} + (ℓ^{i+1} − 1)/(ℓ − 1)]
= (ℓ^{k+1} − ℓ)/(ℓ − 1) + (ℓ^{k+1} − ℓ)/(ℓ − 1)^2 − k/(ℓ − 1)
≤ (ℓ/(ℓ − 1)^2) · ℓ^{k+1}.
In particular, the additive δ+ term is Θ(ℓ^{k+1}), with no linear factor k.

Proof (sketch with checkable steps).
- Non-emptiness of Γ(k): Use the same lexicographic partition z(v) ∈ {0,1}^{k+1} and W = ⋃_{i: z_{i+1}=0} Γ(i) as in the paper. If Γ(k) = ∅, pick z minimal with V_z ≠ ∅. For v ∈ V_z, for each i with z_{i+1} = 0, we have v ∉ Γ(i+1), hence deg^+_{Γ(i)}(v) < t_{i+1}. Summing over i gives deg^+_W(v) < ∑_{i∈I} t_{i+1} ≤ S_{k,ℓ}. If z ≠ 0, then W = V and δ^+(G) ≤ deg^+_W(v) < S_{k,ℓ}, contradicting δ^+(G) ≥ d(P) + S_{k,ℓ}. If z = 0, then for any v ∈ X = V_{0}, deg^+_X(v) ≥ δ^+(G) − S_{k,ℓ} ≥ d(P); by antimonotonicity, Γ(0) ≠ ∅, contradicting z = 0. So Γ(k) ≠ ∅.
- Greedy construction of B: start from v ∈ Γ(k) and build B_i inductively. At stage i, the set of leaves L has size |L| = ℓ^i and lies in Γ(k−i). For w ∈ L, since w ∈ Γ(k−i), deg^+_{Γ(k−i−1)}(w) ≥ t_{i+1} = ℓ^{i+1} + |V(B_i)|. After excluding the |V(B_i)| used vertices, each w has at least ℓ^{i+1} available neighbours in Γ(k−i−1) \ V(B_i). A simple packing (place ℓ children per w, processing the w’s arbitrarily) succeeds because when placing the j-th ℓ-set, at most (j−1)ℓ ≤ ℓ^{i+1} − ℓ of the available neighbours are already used, leaving ≥ ℓ fresh choices. Thus B_{i+1} exists with leaves in Γ(k−i−1). After k steps, B_k = B has leaves in Γ(0), i.e., all leaves satisfy P in G.

Lemma B (ray packing for T(k,ℓ))

Statement. Let L be a set of ℓ^k vertices, and for each w ∈ L let S(w) ≅ S^-_{k,h} be a spider whose center is w. Suppose we have a fixed copy B ≅ B^+_{k,ℓ} with leaf set L. If
h ≥ |V(B)| + (|L|−1)·kℓ + ℓ,
then one can choose subspiders S′(w) ⊆ S(w), each isomorphic to S^-_{k,ℓ}, such that the S′(w) are pairwise vertex-disjoint and disjoint from B except at their centers.

Proof. Process w ∈ L arbitrarily. At the moment of choosing S′(w), the occupied vertices lie in B and in at most |L|−1 previously chosen S′(·). Inside S(w), any vertex besides w lies on exactly one ray; hence each occupied vertex blocks at most one ray of S(w). Since |V(B)| ≤ (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) ≤ 2ℓ^k for ℓ ≥ 2, and each chosen S′(·) contributes kℓ non-centers, at most |V(B)| + (|L|−1)·kℓ rays are blocked. If h ≥ |V(B)| + (|L|−1)·kℓ + ℓ, then at least ℓ rays remain to form S′(w). Disjointness follows by construction.

Corollary C (quantitative T(k,ℓ)-embedding). Let h* := kℓ^{k+1} + 2ℓ^k + ℓ. If G has δ^+(G) ≥ f(k,h*) + S_{k,ℓ}, then G contains T(k,ℓ). Proof: apply Result A with P = “center of S^-_{k,h*}”, then Lemma B with |L| = ℓ^k and |V(B)| ≤ 2ℓ^k.

Result D (k = 2 spiders via maximum matching)

Statement. Let ℓ ≥ 1 and G be a digraph with δ^+(G) = d. Then there is a vertex a with
|{2-paths V → B → a}| ≥ d(d − 2ℓ),
where B = {v : deg^-(v) < 2ℓ}. For such a, let Y = N^-_B(a) and form the bipartite graph H between U = V \ {a} and Y with edge set {q ∈ U → b ∈ Y in G}. Let s be the size of a maximum matching in H. Then
s ≥ d(d − 2ℓ − 1)/(d + 2ℓ − 1).
In particular, if d satisfies d(d − 2ℓ − 1) ≥ ℓ(d + 2ℓ − 1), then G contains S^-_{2,ℓ}.

Proof. The lower bound |V → B → {a}| ≥ d(d − 2ℓ) is the paper’s inequality (averaging over a ∈ A). Every 2-path V → Y → a is of the form q → b → a with q ∈ V, b ∈ Y, so the total count W_total equals e(H) + deg^+_Y(a). By maximality of the matching M of size s, if Q ⊆ U and S ⊆ Y are the vertices of U,Y covered by M, then there are no edges between (U \ Q) and (Y \ S). Hence the total number of edges from U into Y \ S is at most ∑_{q∈Q} deg^+(q) ≤ s d. Also the number of edges from U into S is at most ∑_{b∈S} deg^-(b) ≤ (2ℓ − 1)s since S ⊆ B. Therefore
W_total ≤ s d + (2ℓ − 1)s + deg^+_Y(a) ≤ s(d + 2ℓ − 1) + d.
Combining with W_total ≥ d(d − 2ℓ) gives s ≥ [d(d − 2ℓ) − d]/(d + 2ℓ − 1) = d(d − 2ℓ − 1)/(d + 2ℓ − 1). Finally, any maximum matching of size s yields S^-_{2,s} by orienting q_i → b_i → a along the matching edges and the arcs b_i → a.

Consequences. Solving s ≥ ℓ gives the quadratic
d^2 − (2ℓ + 1)d − ℓ(2ℓ − 1) ≥ 0,
whose positive root is d ≥ ((3ℓ + 1) + √(17ℓ^2 + 2ℓ + 1))/2 = ((3 + √17)/2)ℓ + O(1). Thus this reasoning recovers a linear bound of the same asymptotic constant as in the paper, with a rigorous matching-based proof.

Examples and checks

- For ℓ = 2 and k arbitrary, S_{k,2} ≤ (2/(1)^2)·2^{k+1} = 2^{k+2} = 4·2^k, improving the paper’s additive 2k·2^k.
- Lemma B: For k = 1, B is an out-star of size ℓ+1 and |V(B)| = ℓ+1 ≤ 2ℓ; h* = ℓ + 2ℓ + ℓ = 4ℓ suffices to pick ℓ disjoint edges per center, consistent with the simple disjointness requirement.

Obstacles

- Pushing S_{k,ℓ} below Θ(ℓ^{k+1}) in the abstract δ+-common framework seems impossible by greedy alone: at depth i, one must reserve ℓ^{i+1} distinct children for ℓ^i leaves, imposing a per-level cost that sums to Θ(ℓ^{k+1}). Sharper constants may require a global semi-random selection across levels.
- For k = 2 spiders, the matching bound above essentially saturates the available degree information; improving the ~3.56 constant plausibly needs additional structure (e.g., strong restrictions on 2-cycles or better lower bounds on |V → B → a|).

Next steps

- Attempt a semi-random (nibble) selection across all frontier leaves at each level to replace the per-vertex requirement deg ≥ ℓ^{i+1} + |V(B_i)| by (1+ε)ℓ^{i+1} + o(ℓ^{i+1}), shaving constants in S_{k,ℓ}.
- Globalize ray packing: process S(w) in random order and assign rays via a matching in an auxiliary k-uniform hypergraph; Pippenger–Spencer-type results may reduce h from kℓ^{k+1} + O(ℓ^k) to (1+o(1))kℓ^{k+1} with explicit o(1).
- Investigate f(k,h) from Aboulker et al.: any polynomial bound in h (for fixed k) would make the reductions above quantitatively impactful for T(k,ℓ)-embedding.
