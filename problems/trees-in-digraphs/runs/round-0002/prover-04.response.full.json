For 0\u2264i\u2264k: |V(B^+_{i,\u2113})| = \u2211_{j=0}^{i} \u2113^j = (\u2113^{i+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121). In particular, |V(B^+_{k,\u2113})| \u2264 (\u2113^{k+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121) \u2264 2\u2113^k for all \u2113\u22652.\\n\\nProof. Standard geometric sum; the last inequality holds since \u2113^{k+1}\u22121 \u2264 (2\u2113\u22122)\u2113^k for \u2113\u22652.\\n\\nTheorem 2 (Refined outstar-with-\u03b4+-common-leaves). Let \u2113\u22652, k\u22651, and \u2118 be a \u03b4^+-common property with threshold d(\u2118). If \u03b4^+(G) \u2265 d(\u2118) + kT with T := \u2113^k + \u2308(\u2113^k\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121)\u2309, then G contains a copy B of B^+_{k,\u2113} whose leaves all satisfy \u2118.\\n\\nProof. Define \u0393(0):= {v: v satisfies \u2118}, and for i\u22651 let \u0393(i):= {v: deg^+_{\u0393(i\u22121)}(v) \u2265 T}. As in the paper\u2019s lexicographic argument, suppose \u0393(k)=\u2205 and let z be the \u227a-minimal vector with V_z\u2260\u2205 and z_k=0. Set I:= {i\u2208{0,\u2026,k\u22121}: z_{i+1}=0} and W:=\u22c3_{i\u2208I} \u0393(i). Then V=W if z\u22600\u20d7 and V=W\u222aX if z=0\u20d7. For v\u2208V_z, each i\u2208I gives v\u2209\u0393(i+1), so deg^+_{\u0393(i)}(v) < T. Summing over i\u2208I yields deg^+_W(v) < |I|\u00b7T \u2264 kT. If z\u22600\u20d7, then deg^+(v)=deg^+_W(v)<kT contradicts \u03b4^+(G) \u2265 d(\u2118)+kT \u2265 kT. If z=0\u20d7, then deg^+_X(v) \u2265 \u03b4^+(G)\u2212deg^+_W(v) > d(\u2118), so \u03b4^+(G[X])\u2265d(\u2118), and by antimonotonicity, a vertex of X satisfies \u2118 in G, contradicting z=0\u20d7. Hence \u0393(k)\u2260\u2205.\\nNow greedily construct B_i (0\u2264i\u2264k) with leaves in \u0393(k\u2212i). Let B_0 be a vertex v\u2208\u0393(k). For 0\u2264i\u2264k\u22121, suppose B_i is built; let L be its set of leaves, with |L|\u2264\u2113^i. For w\u2208L, deg^+_{\u0393(k\u2212i\u22121)\\\\V(B_i)}(w) \u2265 T\u2212|V(B_i)| \u2265 \u2113^k by Lemma 1 and the choice of T. Process leaves one by one; by the time we choose for the r-th leaf, at most r\u2113 \u2264 |L|\u2113 \u2264 \u2113^{i+1} neighbours are used, leaving at least \u2113^k\u2212\u2113^{i+1} \u2265 \u2113 choices. Pick \u2113 fresh out-neighbours for each w; these sets are disjoint and form B_{i+1} with leaves in \u0393(k\u2212i\u22121). Induction gives B_k whose leaves lie in \u0393(0), i.e., satisfy \u2118.\\n\\nProposition 3 (Ray-packing for T(k,\u2113)). Let L be the \u2113^k leaves of an embedded B:=B^+_{k,\u2113}. Suppose each w\u2208L is the center of a copy S(w)\u2245S^-_{k,h} in G. If h \u2265 k\u2113^{k+1} + 2\u2113^k + \u2113, then one can choose disjoint S\u2032(w)\u2245S^-_{k,\u2113} for all w\u2208L, with S\u2032(w)\u2229B={w} and S\u2032(w) pairwise disjoint.\\n\\nProof. At the moment of choosing S\u2032(w), the forbidden vertex set F consists of V(B) and vertices in previously chosen S\u2032(w\u2032), w\u2032\u2260w. We have |V(B)| \u2264 (\u2113^{k+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121) \u2264 2\u2113^k (Lemma 1), and each S\u2032(w\u2032) contributes exactly k\u2113 non-center vertices, so |F| \u2264 2\u2113^k + (|L|\u22121)k\u2113 \u2264 2\u2113^k + k\u2113^{k+1}. In S(w), every vertex other than the center belongs to exactly one ray, while the center lies on all rays. Thus the number of rays hit by F is at most |F|+1 (the +1 accounts for the center). Therefore at least h \u2212 (|F|+1) \u2265 \u2113 rays remain, so we can take S\u2032(w). Proceeding greedily over w\u2208L gives the disjoint family.\\n\\nCorollary 4 (Improved T(k,\u2113) bound). Let h := k\u2113^{k+1} + 2\u2113^k + \u2113. If \u03b4^+(G) \u2265 f(k,h) + k(\u2113^k + \u2308(\u2113^k\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121)\u2309), then G contains T(k,\u2113).\\n\\nProof. Apply Theorem 2 with \u2118 = \u201cv is center of S^-_{k,h}\u201d (d(\u2118)=f(k,h)), obtain B with leaves L, and then apply Proposition 3.\\n\\nTheorem 5 (k=2 Giant Spiders; improved and repaired). Let \u2113\u22651 and G a digraph with all out-degrees equal to d. If d > ((3\u2113\u22121)+\u221a(17\u2113^2\u221210\u2113+1))/2, then G contains S^-_{2,\u2113}.\\n\\nProof. Partition V=A\u222aB with A={v: deg^\u2212(v)\u22652\u2113} and B=V\\\\A (so deg^\u2212(b)\u22642\u2113\u22121 for b\u2208B). If some r\u2208A has deg^\u2212_A(r)\u22652\u2113, greedily build S^-_{2,\u2113} ending at r. Otherwise deg^\u2212_A(v)\u22642\u2113\u22121 for all v\u2208A. Consider 2-walks (ordered triples (x,y,z) with (x,y),(y,z)\u2208E). Then\\n|A\u2192V\u2192V| = |A| d^2,\\n|A\u2192A\u2192V| \u2264 e(G[A]) d \u2264 (2\u2113\u22121)d |A|,\\n|B\u2192B\u2192V| = e(G[B]) d,\\n|V\u2192B\u2192B| = \u2211_{y\u2208B} deg^\u2212(y)\u00b7deg^+_B(y) \u2264 (2\u2113\u22121) e(G[B]).\\nHence\\n|V\u2192B\u2192A| = |V\u2192B\u2192V| \u2212 |V\u2192B\u2192B| \\n\u2265 (|A\u2192V\u2192V| \u2212 |A\u2192A\u2192V|) + |B\u2192B\u2192V| \u2212 |V\u2192B\u2192B|\\n\u2265 |A| d(d\u22122\u2113+1) + e(G[B])(d\u2212(2\u2113\u22121))\\n\u2265 |A| d(d\u22122\u2113+1).\\nSo there exists a\u2208A with |V\u2192B\u2192{a}| \u2265 d(d\u22122\u2113+1). Form the bipartite graph H between L:=V\\\\{a} and R:=N^-_B(a), with edges (q,b) whenever (q,b)\u2208E. Let M be a maximum matching, with matched sets Q\u2286L and S\u2286R, |M|=|Q|=|S|=:s. By maximality, every b\u2208R\\\\S has N_H(b)\u2286Q (otherwise we could augment M). Then\\n|V\u2192S\u2192{a}| = \u2211_{b\u2208S} deg^\u2212(b) \u2264 (2\u2113\u22121) s,\\n|V\u2192(R\\\\S)\u2192{a}| = \u2211_{b\u2208R\\\\S} deg^\u2212(b) \u2264 e(Q, R\\\\S) \u2264 \u2211_{q\u2208Q} deg^+(q) = d s.\\nTherefore d(d\u22122\u2113+1) \u2264 |V\u2192B\u2192{a}| \u2264 (2\u2113\u22121)s + ds = (d+2\u2113\u22121)s, implying s \u2265 d(d\u22122\u2113+1)/(d+2\u2113\u22121). If d exceeds the stated root, then s>\u2113 and G contains S^-_{2,\u2113}.\\n\\nCounterexample/limitation to \u201cindependent-of-k\u201d additive term via local thresholds\\n\\n- The schedule t_{k\u2212i}=\u2113^{i+1}+\u2308(\u2113^{i+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121)\u2309 (as proposed in the notes) actually sums to \u0398(\u2113^{k+1}) over i=0,\u2026,k\u22121:\\nS_{k,\u2113}=\u2211_{i=0}^{k\u22121} (\u2113^{i+1} + (\u2113^{i+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121)) = \u0398(\u2113^{k+1}). Thus \u03b4^+ \u2265 d(\u2118)+S_{k,\u2113} is not independent of k.\\n- More fundamentally, the current lexicographic-partition proof accumulates a per-level threshold across all k levels. Without a new global selection principle (e.g., a b-matching across all leaves at each expansion level, or a multi-layer flow/nibble), one cannot avoid the k-fold accumulation. Greedy, purely local-degree thresholds necessarily pay about |L|\u00b7\u2113 = \u2113^{i+1} at level i to guarantee disjointness.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\n- Tightness of Proposition 3\u2019s 2\u2113^k term: |V(B)| equals (\u2113^{k+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121) which is between \u2113^k and 2\u2113^k for \u2113\u22652. Thus replacing 2\u2113^k by |V(B)| marginally improves constants but not asymptotics.\\n- For Theorem 2, T cannot be below \u2113^k in general: construct at level i=k\u22121 a configuration where all \u2113^{k\u22121} leaves have identical neighborhood of size exactly \u2113^k in \u0393(0)\\\\V(B_{k\u22121}). Any selection must use all \u2113^k vertices. Hence deg^+ into \u0393(0)\\\\V(B_{k\u22121}) of size \u2265\u2113^k is necessary for worst-case graphs.\\n\\nObstacles\\n\\n- Eliminating the factor k in the additive term appears to require a global b-matching (demand \u2113 per leaf) at each expansion step. A local-degree threshold alone cannot guarantee Hall\u2019s condition for all subsets of leaves in adversarial graphs.\\n- Further improvements to the k=2 constant seem to require different decompositions or refined inequalities beyond the 2-walk/matching approach; the current method looks close to optimal within its template.\\n\\nNext steps\\n\\n- Develop a global b-matching framework per level: Given L (|L|=\u2113^i) and R=\u0393(k\u2212i\u22121)\\\\V(B_i), find sufficient conditions (in terms of \u03b4^+ and robust expansion of \u0393-sets) ensuring existence of a b-matching of size \u2113 per leaf. Target an additive overhead S_{k,\u2113} \u2248 (1+o(1))\u2113^k instead of k\u2113^k.\\n- Globalize ray packing: treat all S(w) simultaneously, seeking an allocation of \u2113 rays per center that is globally disjoint with only h \u2248 (1+o(1))k\u2113^{k+1}. This becomes a packing problem of directed paths; consider flow or matroid intersection.\\n- Investigate improved bounds on f(k,h) in Proposition 3.2: extracting a polynomial-in-h dependence for fixed k would substantially reduce overall \u03b4^+-thresholds.\\n- Check extremal constructions to calibrate constants and identify potential further constant-factor gains in Theorem 2\u2019s T and Proposition 3\u2019s h.\\n\\nSummary of checkable advances\\n\\n- Theorem 2: \u03b4^+(G) \u2265 d(\u2118) + k(\u2113^k + \u2308(\u2113^k\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121)\u2309) \u21d2 B^+_{k,\u2113} with all leaves satisfying \u2118. Proof given in full detail.\\n- Proposition 3 + Corollary 4: h \u2265 k\u2113^{k+1} + 2\u2113^k + \u2113 suffices to pack disjoint in-spiders at the leaves, yielding T(k,\u2113) under \u03b4^+(G) \u2265 f(k,h) + k(\u2113^k + \u2308(\u2113^k\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121)\u2309).\\n- Theorem 5: Improved k=2 bound \u03b4^+ > ((3\u2113\u22121)+\u221a(17\u2113^2\u221210\u2113+1))/2 via a maximum matching and 2-walk counting; detailed proof provided.\\n- Clarified that the proposed \u201cindependent-of-k\u201d S_{k,\u2113} in the notes does not follow from the stated threshold schedule; a different, global method would be needed to achieve that target.\"}",
