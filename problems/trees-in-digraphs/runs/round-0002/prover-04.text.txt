Ideas

- Correct and formalize the “outstar-with-δ+-common-leaves” improvement: give a rigorous version with a uniform threshold T = ℓ^k + ⌈(ℓ^k−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉, yielding an additive term kT = k(1+1/(ℓ−1))ℓ^k + O(k), which strictly improves the paper’s 2kℓ^k.
- Sharpen the “ray packing” step for T(k,ℓ): h ≥ kℓ^{k+1} + 2ℓ^k + ℓ suffices, reducing the paper’s 3kℓ^{k+1} by a factor ≈ 3.
- Repair and slightly improve the k=2 spider bound using a maximum-matching and 2-walk counting: s ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1)/(d+2ℓ−1), hence δ^+ > ((3ℓ−1)+√(17ℓ^2−10ℓ+1))/2 is sufficient.
- Point out a flaw in the “level-dependent thresholds give S_{k,ℓ}=Θ(ℓ^k)” note: the proposed schedule actually sums to Θ(ℓ^{k+1}); an independence-of-k bound appears to need a new (global) selection method.

Refined theorems and proofs

Lemma 1 (size bounds for B^+_{i,ℓ}). For 0≤i≤k: |V(B^+_{i,ℓ})| = ∑_{j=0}^{i} ℓ^j = (ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1). In particular, |V(B^+_{k,ℓ})| ≤ (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) ≤ 2ℓ^k for all ℓ≥2.

Proof. Standard geometric sum; the last inequality holds since ℓ^{k+1}−1 ≤ (2ℓ−2)ℓ^k for ℓ≥2.

Theorem 2 (Refined outstar-with-δ+-common-leaves). Let ℓ≥2, k≥1, and ℘ be a δ^+-common property with threshold d(℘). If δ^+(G) ≥ d(℘) + kT with T := ℓ^k + ⌈(ℓ^k−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉, then G contains a copy B of B^+_{k,ℓ} whose leaves all satisfy ℘.

Proof. Define Γ(0):= {v: v satisfies ℘}, and for i≥1 let Γ(i):= {v: deg^+_{Γ(i−1)}(v) ≥ T}. As in the paper’s lexicographic argument, suppose Γ(k)=∅ and let z be the ≺-minimal vector with V_z≠∅ and z_k=0. Set I:= {i∈{0,…,k−1}: z_{i+1}=0} and W:=⋃_{i∈I} Γ(i). Then V=W if z≠0⃗ and V=W∪X if z=0⃗. For v∈V_z, each i∈I gives v∉Γ(i+1), so deg^+_{Γ(i)}(v) < T. Summing over i∈I yields deg^+_W(v) < |I|·T ≤ kT. If z≠0⃗, then deg^+(v)=deg^+_W(v)<kT contradicts δ^+(G) ≥ d(℘)+kT ≥ kT. If z=0⃗, then deg^+_X(v) ≥ δ^+(G)−deg^+_W(v) > d(℘), so δ^+(G[X])≥d(℘), and by antimonotonicity, a vertex of X satisfies ℘ in G, contradicting z=0⃗. Hence Γ(k)≠∅.
Now greedily construct B_i (0≤i≤k) with leaves in Γ(k−i). Let B_0 be a vertex v∈Γ(k). For 0≤i≤k−1, suppose B_i is built; let L be its set of leaves, with |L|≤ℓ^i. For w∈L, deg^+_{Γ(k−i−1)\V(B_i)}(w) ≥ T−|V(B_i)| ≥ ℓ^k by Lemma 1 and the choice of T. Process leaves one by one; by the time we choose for the r-th leaf, at most rℓ ≤ |L|ℓ ≤ ℓ^{i+1} neighbours are used, leaving at least ℓ^k−ℓ^{i+1} ≥ ℓ choices. Pick ℓ fresh out-neighbours for each w; these sets are disjoint and form B_{i+1} with leaves in Γ(k−i−1). Induction gives B_k whose leaves lie in Γ(0), i.e., satisfy ℘.

Proposition 3 (Ray-packing for T(k,ℓ)). Let L be the ℓ^k leaves of an embedded B:=B^+_{k,ℓ}. Suppose each w∈L is the center of a copy S(w)≅S^-_{k,h} in G. If h ≥ kℓ^{k+1} + 2ℓ^k + ℓ, then one can choose disjoint S′(w)≅S^-_{k,ℓ} for all w∈L, with S′(w)∩B={w} and S′(w) pairwise disjoint.

Proof. At the moment of choosing S′(w), the forbidden vertex set F consists of V(B) and vertices in previously chosen S′(w′), w′≠w. We have |V(B)| ≤ (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) ≤ 2ℓ^k (Lemma 1), and each S′(w′) contributes exactly kℓ non-center vertices, so |F| ≤ 2ℓ^k + (|L|−1)kℓ ≤ 2ℓ^k + kℓ^{k+1}. In S(w), every vertex other than the center belongs to exactly one ray, while the center lies on all rays. Thus the number of rays hit by F is at most |F|+1 (the +1 accounts for the center). Therefore at least h − (|F|+1) ≥ ℓ rays remain, so we can take S′(w). Proceeding greedily over w∈L gives the disjoint family.

Corollary 4 (Improved T(k,ℓ) bound). Let h := kℓ^{k+1} + 2ℓ^k + ℓ. If δ^+(G) ≥ f(k,h) + k(ℓ^k + ⌈(ℓ^k−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉), then G contains T(k,ℓ).

Proof. Apply Theorem 2 with ℘ = “v is center of S^-_{k,h}” (d(℘)=f(k,h)), obtain B with leaves L, and then apply Proposition 3.

Theorem 5 (k=2 Giant Spiders; improved and repaired). Let ℓ≥1 and G a digraph with all out-degrees equal to d. If d > ((3ℓ−1)+√(17ℓ^2−10ℓ+1))/2, then G contains S^-_{2,ℓ}.

Proof. Partition V=A∪B with A={v: deg^−(v)≥2ℓ} and B=V\A (so deg^−(b)≤2ℓ−1 for b∈B). If some r∈A has deg^−_A(r)≥2ℓ, greedily build S^-_{2,ℓ} ending at r. Otherwise deg^−_A(v)≤2ℓ−1 for all v∈A. Consider 2-walks (ordered triples (x,y,z) with (x,y),(y,z)∈E). Then
|A→V→V| = |A| d^2,
|A→A→V| ≤ e(G[A]) d ≤ (2ℓ−1)d |A|,
|B→B→V| = e(G[B]) d,
|V→B→B| = ∑_{y∈B} deg^−(y)·deg^+_B(y) ≤ (2ℓ−1) e(G[B]).
Hence
|V→B→A| = |V→B→V| − |V→B→B| 
≥ (|A→V→V| − |A→A→V|) + |B→B→V| − |V→B→B|
≥ |A| d(d−2ℓ+1) + e(G[B])(d−(2ℓ−1))
≥ |A| d(d−2ℓ+1).
So there exists a∈A with |V→B→{a}| ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1). Form the bipartite graph H between L:=V\{a} and R:=N^-_B(a), with edges (q,b) whenever (q,b)∈E. Let M be a maximum matching, with matched sets Q⊆L and S⊆R, |M|=|Q|=|S|=:s. By maximality, every b∈R\S has N_H(b)⊆Q (otherwise we could augment M). Then
|V→S→{a}| = ∑_{b∈S} deg^−(b) ≤ (2ℓ−1) s,
|V→(R\S)→{a}| = ∑_{b∈R\S} deg^−(b) ≤ e(Q, R\S) ≤ ∑_{q∈Q} deg^+(q) = d s.
Therefore d(d−2ℓ+1) ≤ |V→B→{a}| ≤ (2ℓ−1)s + ds = (d+2ℓ−1)s, implying s ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1)/(d+2ℓ−1). If d exceeds the stated root, then s>ℓ and G contains S^-_{2,ℓ}.

Counterexample/limitation to “independent-of-k” additive term via local thresholds

- The schedule t_{k−i}=ℓ^{i+1}+⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉ (as proposed in the notes) actually sums to Θ(ℓ^{k+1}) over i=0,…,k−1:
S_{k,ℓ}=∑_{i=0}^{k−1} (ℓ^{i+1} + (ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)) = Θ(ℓ^{k+1}). Thus δ^+ ≥ d(℘)+S_{k,ℓ} is not independent of k.
- More fundamentally, the current lexicographic-partition proof accumulates a per-level threshold across all k levels. Without a new global selection principle (e.g., a b-matching across all leaves at each expansion level, or a multi-layer flow/nibble), one cannot avoid the k-fold accumulation. Greedy, purely local-degree thresholds necessarily pay about |L|·ℓ = ℓ^{i+1} at level i to guarantee disjointness.

Examples

- Tightness of Proposition 3’s 2ℓ^k term: |V(B)| equals (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) which is between ℓ^k and 2ℓ^k for ℓ≥2. Thus replacing 2ℓ^k by |V(B)| marginally improves constants but not asymptotics.
- For Theorem 2, T cannot be below ℓ^k in general: construct at level i=k−1 a configuration where all ℓ^{k−1} leaves have identical neighborhood of size exactly ℓ^k in Γ(0)\V(B_{k−1}). Any selection must use all ℓ^k vertices. Hence deg^+ into Γ(0)\V(B_{k−1}) of size ≥ℓ^k is necessary for worst-case graphs.

Obstacles

- Eliminating the factor k in the additive term appears to require a global b-matching (demand ℓ per leaf) at each expansion step. A local-degree threshold alone cannot guarantee Hall’s condition for all subsets of leaves in adversarial graphs.
- Further improvements to the k=2 constant seem to require different decompositions or refined inequalities beyond the 2-walk/matching approach; the current method looks close to optimal within its template.

Next steps

- Develop a global b-matching framework per level: Given L (|L|=ℓ^i) and R=Γ(k−i−1)\V(B_i), find sufficient conditions (in terms of δ^+ and robust expansion of Γ-sets) ensuring existence of a b-matching of size ℓ per leaf. Target an additive overhead S_{k,ℓ} ≈ (1+o(1))ℓ^k instead of kℓ^k.
- Globalize ray packing: treat all S(w) simultaneously, seeking an allocation of ℓ rays per center that is globally disjoint with only h ≈ (1+o(1))kℓ^{k+1}. This becomes a packing problem of directed paths; consider flow or matroid intersection.
- Investigate improved bounds on f(k,h) in Proposition 3.2: extracting a polynomial-in-h dependence for fixed k would substantially reduce overall δ^+-thresholds.
- Check extremal constructions to calibrate constants and identify potential further constant-factor gains in Theorem 2’s T and Proposition 3’s h.

Summary of checkable advances

- Proposition 3 + Corollary 4: h ≥ kℓ^{k+1} + 2ℓ^k + ℓ suffices to pack disjoint in-spiders at the leaves, yielding T(k,ℓ) under δ^+(G) ≥ f(k,h) + k(ℓ^k + ⌈(ℓ^k−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉).
- Theorem 5: Improved k=2 bound δ^+ > ((3ℓ−1)+√(17ℓ^2−10ℓ+1))/2 via a maximum matching and 2-walk counting; detailed proof provided.
- Clarified that the proposed “independent-of-k” S_{k,ℓ} in the notes does not follow from the stated threshold schedule; a different, global method would be needed to achieve that target.
