{"summary_md":"Refinements and fixes to the paper's main constructions. A level-dependent threshold schedule t_{k-i}=ℓ^{i+1}+⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉ yields S_{k,ℓ}=∑_i t_i = Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k) (no linear-in-k factor); a sharper bound is S_{k,ℓ} ≤ ℓ(ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ)/(ℓ−1)^2 + ((ℓ−2)/(ℓ−1))k. A ray-packing lemma shows one can extract disjoint S^-_{k,ℓ} at all ℓ^k leaves when h ≥ |V(B)| + kℓ|L| + ℓ, giving h ≥ kℓ^{k+1} + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ (improving previous bounds). For k=2, counting 2-walks plus a maximum-matching argument yields s ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1)/(d+2ℓ−1) and hence S^-_{2,ℓ} appears when δ^+ > d_*(ℓ)=((3ℓ−1)+√(17ℓ^2−10ℓ+1))/2, fixing a gap in the original proof. Next steps target global selection/packing and better bounds on f(k,h).
