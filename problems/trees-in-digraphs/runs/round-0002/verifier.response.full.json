Provers 1\u20133 independently gave the same level-dependent thresholds t_{k\u2212i}=\u2113^{i+1}+\u2308(\u2113^{i+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121)\u2309 with a standard lexicographic argument and a careful greedy extension. This removes the linear-in-k factor from the additive term (replacing 2k\u2113^k by S_{k,\u2113}=\u2211 t_i), yielding S_{k,\u2113}=\u0398_\u2113(\u2113^k) (i.e., C(\u2113)\u00b7\u2113^k, no factor k). The construction is rigorous. Among constant bounds, Prover 1\u2019s S_{k,\u2113} \u2264 \u2113(\u2113^{k+1}\u2212\u2113)/(\u2113\u22121)^2 + ((\u2113\u22122)/(\u2113\u22121))k is sharper than the coarse 2\u2113/(\u2113\u22121)\u00b7\u2113^k+O(1).\\n\\n2) Ray packing (attaching S^-_{k,\u2113}).

Specializing gives h \u2265 k\u2113^{k+1} + (\u2113^{k+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121) + \u2113, which improves the earlier k\u2113^{k+1}+2\u2113^k+\u2113 and the paper\u2019s 3k\u2113^{k+1}.\\n\\n3) k=2 spiders. The matching-based repair is essential: t:=|V\u2192B\u2192{a}| counts all 2-walks via B to a, but edges in the predecessor bipartite graph H exclude q=a and thus |E(H)|=t\u2212deg^+_B(a).
