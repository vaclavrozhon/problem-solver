Provers 1–3 independently gave the same level-dependent thresholds t_{k−i}=ℓ^{i+1}+⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉ with a standard lexicographic argument and a careful greedy extension. This removes the linear-in-k factor from the additive term (replacing 2kℓ^k by S_{k,ℓ}=∑ t_i), yielding S_{k,ℓ}=Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k) (i.e., C(ℓ)·ℓ^k, no factor k). The construction is rigorous. Among constant bounds, Prover 1’s S_{k,ℓ} ≤ ℓ(ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ)/(ℓ−1)^2 + ((ℓ−2)/(ℓ−1))k is sharper than the coarse 2ℓ/(ℓ−1)·ℓ^k+O(1).\n\n2) Ray packing (attaching S^-_{k,ℓ}). All provers’ arguments are correct: each previously used vertex blocks at most one ray in a fixed S(w). The exact bound h ≥ |V(B)| + kℓ·|L| + ℓ is best in this framework. Specializing gives h ≥ kℓ^{k+1} + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ, which improves the earlier kℓ^{k+1}+2ℓ^k+ℓ and the paper’s 3kℓ^{k+1}.\n\n3) k=2 spiders. The matching-based repair is essential: t:=|V→B→{a}| counts all 2-walks via B to a, but edges in the predecessor bipartite graph H exclude q=a and thus |E(H)|=t−deg^+_B(a). Hence one must subtract ≤d. The correct inequality is s ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1)/(d+2ℓ−1) up to a +d correction (or variants with (d−1)-factors); this yields the threshold δ^+ > ((3ℓ−1)+√(17ℓ^2−10ℓ+1))/2, improving finite-ℓ constants while recovering (3+√17)/2 asymptotically. Prover 1’s claimed ≈(1+√3)ℓ bound omits the +d term and is not justified.\n\nTriage: Keep the variable-threshold theorem (with a sharp S_{k,ℓ} bound) and the refined ray-packing h using |V(B)|.

Identical to Lemma 3: at the moment of choosing S′(w), the number of blocked rays in S(w) is at most |U|, where U is the union of V(B) and the non-centre vertices of previously chosen S′(·). Hence it suffices to require h ≥ |U| + ℓ. Since |U| ≤ |V(B)| + kℓ·(|L|−1) ≤ |V(B)| + kℓ·|L|, the stated bound on h guarantees ≥ℓ unblocked rays for every w. ∎\n\nRemark.
