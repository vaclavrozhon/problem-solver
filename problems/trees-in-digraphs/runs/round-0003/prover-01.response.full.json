Let \u03a0 be a \u03b4^+-common vertex property with threshold d(\u03a0). Fix \u2113 \u2265 2, k \u2265 1. Define \u0393(0) = {v : v satisfies \u03a0} and, for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k,\\n\u0393(j) = { v : deg^+_{\u0393(j\u22121)}(v) \u2265 t_j },\\nwhere, for i = 0,\u2026,k\u22121,\\n t_{k\u2212i} := \u2113^{i+1} + \u2308(\u2113^{i+1} \u2212 1)/(\u2113 \u2212 1)\u2309, and set t_k := \u2113.\\nIf \u03b4^+(G) \u2265 d(\u03a0) + S_{k,\u2113} with S_{k,\u2113} := \u2211_{j=1}^k t_j, then G contains B \u2245 B^+_{k,\u2113} whose leaves all satisfy \u03a0.\\n\\nProof sketch (fully checkable). The lexicographic partition argument from the paper (Claim 3.8) carries through verbatim with thresholds t_j: assuming \u0393(k)=\u2205, take the lexicographically minimal nonempty class V_z with z_k=0, let I := {i: z_{i+1}=0}, W := \u22c3_{i\u2208I} \u0393(i). Then for v \u2208 V_z,\\n deg^+_W(v) < \u2211_{i\u2208I} t_{i+1} \u2264 S_{k,\u2113}.\\nIf z \u2260 0\u20d7, this contradicts \u03b4^+(G) \u2265 S_{k,\u2113}.

Hence \u0393(k) \u2260 \u2205.\\nTake v \u2208 \u0393(k). Build B_i \u2245 B^+_{i,\u2113} inductively, with leaves L_i \u2286 \u0393(k\u2212i) and |V(B_i)| = (\u2113^{i+1} \u2212 1)/(\u2113 \u2212 1), |L_i|=\u2113^i. To form B_{i+1}, for each w \u2208 L_i select \u2113 out-neighbours in \u0393(k\u2212i\u22121), avoiding V(B_i) and keeping choices across different w disjoint. In a greedy order, when treating the j-th leaf, at most |V(B_i)| + \u2113(j\u22121) neighbours are forbidden. Thus it suffices that every w has\\n deg^+_{\u0393(k\u2212i\u22121)}(w) \u2265 |V(B_i)| + \u2113|L_i| = (\u2113^{i+1} \u2212 1)/(\u2113 \u2212 1) + \u2113^{i+1},\\nexactly ensured by t_{k\u2212i}. For i=0, the bound t_k = \u2113 is enough: B_1 is an out-star, so we only need \u2113 out-neighbours of v in \u0393(k\u22121). Thus B_k exists with leaves in \u0393(0), i.e. satisfying \u03a0.\\n\\nExplicit bound on S_{k,\u2113}.

Let B \u2245 B^+_{k,\u2113} with leaves L (|L|=\u2113^k). For each w \u2208 L let S(w) \u2245 S^-_{k,h} centred at w. If\\n h \u2265 |V(B)| + k\u2113\u00b7|L| + \u2113 = (\u2113^{k+1} \u2212 1)/(\u2113 \u2212 1) + k\u2113^{k+1} + \u2113,\\nthen one can choose pairwise vertex-disjoint S\u2032(w) \u2245 S^-_{k,\u2113}, each disjoint from B except at w.\\n\\nProof. Process L arbitrarily. Let U be the union of B and already chosen S\u2032. In S(w), each vertex of U\\\\{w} lies on at most one ray, so at most |U|\u22121 rays are blocked. As |U| \u2264 |V(B)| + k\u2113(|L|\u22121) at all steps, the stated h guarantees at least \u2113 unblocked rays remain for w.\\n\\nCorollary (T(k,\u2113) threshold). Let h* := (\u2113^{k+1} \u2212 1)/(\u2113 \u2212 1) + k\u2113^{k+1} + \u2113. If \u03b4^+(G) \u2265 f(k,h*) + S_{k,\u2113}, then G contains T(k,\u2113).\\n\\nProof. Take \u03a0 = \u201ccentre of S^-_{k,h*}\u201d. Apply the Theorem to obtain B with all leaves satisfying \u03a0, then the Lemma to attach disjoint S\u2032(w).\\n\\nCorrection and strengthening for k=2 spiders\\n\\nTheorem (k=2). Any digraph G with minimum out-degree d > d_*(\u2113) := ((3\u2113 \u2212 1) + \u221a(17\u2113^2 \u2212 10\u2113 + 1))/2 contains S^-_{2,\u2113}.\\n\\nProof. Assume deg^+(v)=d for all v by edge deletions. Partition V into A := {deg^\u2212 \u2265 2\u2113} and B := V\\\\A; if r \u2208 A has deg^-_A(r) \u2265 2\u2113, greedily embed S^-_{2,\u2113}. Otherwise deg^-_A(\u00b7) \u2264 2\u2113\u22121 on A. Count directed 2-walks:\\n |A \u21d2 V \u21d2 V| = |A| d^2;\\n |A \u21d2 A \u21d2 V| \u2264 d e(G[A]) \u2264 (2\u2113\u22121)d|A|;\\n |B \u21d2 B \u21d2 V| = d e(G[B]);\\n |V \u21d2 B \u21d2 B| \u2264 (2\u2113\u22121)e(G[B]).\\nHence |V \u21d2 B \u21d2 A| \u2265 |A| d(d \u2212 2\u2113 + 1) + e(G[B])(d \u2212 2\u2113 + 1) \u2265 |A| d(d \u2212 2\u2113 + 1).\\nPick a \u2208 A with T := |V \u21d2 B \u21d2 {a}| \u2265 d(d \u2212 2\u2113 + 1). Let R := N^-_B(a), U := V\\\\{a}, and build the bipartite predecessor graph H with parts (U,R), edges q\u2014b iff (q,b) \u2208 E. We have |E(H)| = T \u2212 deg^+_B(a) \u2265 d(d \u2212 2\u2113 + 1) \u2212 d. By K\u0151nig\u2019s theorem, if s is the maximum matching size then there is a vertex cover C with |C|=s, so\\n |E(H)| \u2264 \u2211_{q\u2208C\u2229U} deg^+(q) + \u2211_{b\u2208C\u2229R} deg^\u2212(b) \u2264 d|C\u2229U| + (2\u2113\u22121)|C\u2229R| \u2264 (d + 2\u2113 \u2212 1) s.\\nTherefore s \u2265 (d(d \u2212 2\u2113)) / (d + 2\u2113 \u2212 1). If s \u2265 \u2113 we obtain S^-_{2,\u2113}. Solving s \u2265 \u2113 yields d > d_*(\u2113).\\n\\nRemark on optimality of the A/B threshold in this method\\n\\nOne can parametrize the partition threshold by t \u2208 \u2115, letting A := {deg^\u2212 \u2265 t}, B := V\\\\A, and repeating the above argument. In place of 2\u2113 we obtain s \u2265 d(d \u2212 t)/(d + t \u2212 1), leading to the constraint d(d \u2212 t) \u2265 \u2113(d + t \u2212 1). Since in the \u201ceasy\u201d greedy case we only rule out deg^-_A(r) \u2265 2\u2113, the strongest a priori bound available in the \u201chard\u201d case is deg^-_A(\u00b7) \u2264 2\u2113\u22121. Thus taking t < 2\u2113 invalidates the step |A \u21d2 A \u21d2 V| \u2264 (t\u22121)d|A|, while t > 2\u2113 weakens the bound. Hence t = 2\u2113 is optimal within this framework.\\n\\nExamples and constants\\n\\n- Exact S_{k,2}: t_{k\u2212i} = 2^{i+1} + (2^{i+1} \u2212 1) = 2^{i+2} \u2212 1, so S_{k,2} = \u2211_{i=0}^{k\u22121} (2^{i+2} \u2212 1) = 4\u00b72^{k} \u2212 4 \u2212 k. Thus \u03b4^+(G) \u2265 d(\u03a0) + 4\u00b72^{k} \u2212 4 \u2212 k suffices in the \u03a0-setting for \u2113=2.\\n- Ray packing: |V(B)| = (\u2113^{k+1} \u2212 1)/(\u2113 \u2212 1) is exact and can be significantly smaller than the coarse 2\u2113^k used earlier; using it tightens h by \u0398(\u2113^k).\\n\\nObstacles\\n\\n- Further reducing S_{k,\u2113} below the term |V(B_i)| + \u2113|L_i| at each level likely requires a simultaneous b-matching across all leaves (nibble) with control of right-hand degrees and codegrees in the auxiliary bipartite graphs. Without extra pseudorandomness assumptions, Hall-type conditions are hard to certify from minimum out-degree alone.\\n- The ray-packing bound appears near-tight for greedy selection; global packing could shave lower-order terms but seems to require additional structural input.\\n\\nNext steps\\n\\n- Develop a global b-matching (or nibble) lemma for the level-i auxiliary bipartite graphs H_i (left L_i, right \u0393(k\u2212i\u22121)), to replace the per-leaf greedy step. Target: t_{k\u2212i} \u2265 (1+o(1))\u2113^{i+1}, hence S_{k,\u2113} = (1+o_\u2113(1))\u00b7C(\u2113)\u00b7\u2113^k with C(\u2113) as small as possible.\\n- Globalize the ray packing via randomized selections across all S(w) in parallel, aiming at h = (1+o(1))k\u2113^{k+1}.\\n- Seek improved bounds on f(k,h) for \u03a0 = \u201ccentre of S^-_{k,h}\u201d (e.g., polynomial in h for fixed k), which would translate the structural improvements above into substantially smaller \u03b4^+-thresholds for T(k,\u2113).\\n\"}",
