Ideas

- Push the “outstar-with-δ+-common-leaves” theorem to a level-dependent schedule with an explicit, auditably sharp threshold per level, and compute a clean bound on the total additive overhead S_{k,ℓ} = Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k) with no linear-in-k factor.
- Tighten the ray-packing bound h by using the exact |V(B)|, not the coarse 2ℓ^k, keeping the same greedy framework.
- Repair and streamline the k=2 spider proof with a matching/vertex-cover argument that correctly accounts for 2-walks starting at a (subtracting ≤ d).
- Check if varying the A/B threshold (2ℓ → t) improves the k=2 constant; conclude this method is optimized at t=2ℓ.

Refinement 1: Outstar with δ+-common leaves (variable thresholds)

Theorem. Let Π be a δ^+-common vertex property with threshold d(Π). Fix ℓ ≥ 2, k ≥ 1. Define Γ(0) = {v : v satisfies Π} and, for 1 ≤ j ≤ k,
Γ(j) = { v : deg^+_{Γ(j−1)}(v) ≥ t_j },
where, for i = 0,…,k−1,
 t_{k−i} := ℓ^{i+1} + ⌈(ℓ^{i+1} − 1)/(ℓ − 1)⌉, and set t_k := ℓ.
If δ^+(G) ≥ d(Π) + S_{k,ℓ} with S_{k,ℓ} := ∑_{j=1}^k t_j, then G contains B ≅ B^+_{k,ℓ} whose leaves all satisfy Π.

Proof sketch (fully checkable). The lexicographic partition argument from the paper (Claim 3.8) carries through verbatim with thresholds t_j: assuming Γ(k)=∅, take the lexicographically minimal nonempty class V_z with z_k=0, let I := {i: z_{i+1}=0}, W := ⋃_{i∈I} Γ(i). Then for v ∈ V_z,
 deg^+_W(v) < ∑_{i∈I} t_{i+1} ≤ S_{k,ℓ}.
If z ≠ 0⃗, this contradicts δ^+(G) ≥ S_{k,ℓ}. If z = 0⃗, then for all v ∈ X := V \ ⋃_{j=0}^k Γ(j),
 deg^+_X(v) ≥ δ^+(G) − S_{k,ℓ} ≥ d(Π),
so X contains a Π-vertex, contradicting anti-monotonicity. Hence Γ(k) ≠ ∅.
Take v ∈ Γ(k). Build B_i ≅ B^+_{i,ℓ} inductively, with leaves L_i ⊆ Γ(k−i) and |V(B_i)| = (ℓ^{i+1} − 1)/(ℓ − 1), |L_i|=ℓ^i. To form B_{i+1}, for each w ∈ L_i select ℓ out-neighbours in Γ(k−i−1), avoiding V(B_i) and keeping choices across different w disjoint. In a greedy order, when treating the j-th leaf, at most |V(B_i)| + ℓ(j−1) neighbours are forbidden. Thus it suffices that every w has
 deg^+_{Γ(k−i−1)}(w) ≥ |V(B_i)| + ℓ|L_i| = (ℓ^{i+1} − 1)/(ℓ − 1) + ℓ^{i+1},
exactly ensured by t_{k−i}. For i=0, the bound t_k = ℓ is enough: B_1 is an out-star, so we only need ℓ out-neighbours of v in Γ(k−1). Thus B_k exists with leaves in Γ(0), i.e. satisfying Π.

Explicit bound on S_{k,ℓ}. Using ⌈x⌉ ≤ x+1 and summing r=1,…,k,
 S_{k,ℓ} = ∑_{r=1}^k (ℓ^r + ⌈(ℓ^r − 1)/(ℓ − 1)⌉)
 ≤ ∑_{r=1}^k ℓ^r + (1/(ℓ−1))∑_{r=1}^k (ℓ^r − 1) + k
 = ℓ(ℓ^{k+1} − ℓ)/(ℓ−1)^2 + ((ℓ−2)/(ℓ−1))k.
Hence S_{k,ℓ} = (ℓ^2/(ℓ−1)^2)·ℓ^k + O_ℓ(1), i.e. Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k) without a factor k.

Refinement 2: Packing the in-spiders at the leaves

Lemma (ray packing). Let B ≅ B^+_{k,ℓ} with leaves L (|L|=ℓ^k). For each w ∈ L let S(w) ≅ S^-_{k,h} centred at w. If
 h ≥ |V(B)| + kℓ·|L| + ℓ = (ℓ^{k+1} − 1)/(ℓ − 1) + kℓ^{k+1} + ℓ,
then one can choose pairwise vertex-disjoint S′(w) ≅ S^-_{k,ℓ}, each disjoint from B except at w.

Proof. Process L arbitrarily. Let U be the union of B and already chosen S′. In S(w), each vertex of U\{w} lies on at most one ray, so at most |U|−1 rays are blocked. As |U| ≤ |V(B)| + kℓ(|L|−1) at all steps, the stated h guarantees at least ℓ unblocked rays remain for w.

Corollary (T(k,ℓ) threshold). Let h* := (ℓ^{k+1} − 1)/(ℓ − 1) + kℓ^{k+1} + ℓ. If δ^+(G) ≥ f(k,h*) + S_{k,ℓ}, then G contains T(k,ℓ).

Proof. Take Π = “centre of S^-_{k,h*}”. Apply the Theorem to obtain B with all leaves satisfying Π, then the Lemma to attach disjoint S′(w).

Correction and strengthening for k=2 spiders

Theorem (k=2). Any digraph G with minimum out-degree d > d_*(ℓ) := ((3ℓ − 1) + √(17ℓ^2 − 10ℓ + 1))/2 contains S^-_{2,ℓ}.

Proof. Assume deg^+(v)=d for all v by edge deletions. Partition V into A := {deg^− ≥ 2ℓ} and B := V\A; if r ∈ A has deg^-_A(r) ≥ 2ℓ, greedily embed S^-_{2,ℓ}. Otherwise deg^-_A(·) ≤ 2ℓ−1 on A. Count directed 2-walks:
 |A ⇒ V ⇒ V| = |A| d^2;
 |A ⇒ A ⇒ V| ≤ d e(G[A]) ≤ (2ℓ−1)d|A|;
 |B ⇒ B ⇒ V| = d e(G[B]);
 |V ⇒ B ⇒ B| ≤ (2ℓ−1)e(G[B]).
Hence |V ⇒ B ⇒ A| ≥ |A| d(d − 2ℓ + 1) + e(G[B])(d − 2ℓ + 1) ≥ |A| d(d − 2ℓ + 1).
Pick a ∈ A with T := |V ⇒ B ⇒ {a}| ≥ d(d − 2ℓ + 1). Let R := N^-_B(a), U := V\{a}, and build the bipartite predecessor graph H with parts (U,R), edges q—b iff (q,b) ∈ E. We have |E(H)| = T − deg^+_B(a) ≥ d(d − 2ℓ + 1) − d. By Kőnig’s theorem, if s is the maximum matching size then there is a vertex cover C with |C|=s, so
 |E(H)| ≤ ∑_{q∈C∩U} deg^+(q) + ∑_{b∈C∩R} deg^−(b) ≤ d|C∩U| + (2ℓ−1)|C∩R| ≤ (d + 2ℓ − 1) s.
Therefore s ≥ (d(d − 2ℓ)) / (d + 2ℓ − 1). If s ≥ ℓ we obtain S^-_{2,ℓ}. Solving s ≥ ℓ yields d > d_*(ℓ).

Remark on optimality of the A/B threshold in this method

One can parametrize the partition threshold by t ∈ ℕ, letting A := {deg^− ≥ t}, B := V\A, and repeating the above argument. In place of 2ℓ we obtain s ≥ d(d − t)/(d + t − 1), leading to the constraint d(d − t) ≥ ℓ(d + t − 1). Since in the “easy” greedy case we only rule out deg^-_A(r) ≥ 2ℓ, the strongest a priori bound available in the “hard” case is deg^-_A(·) ≤ 2ℓ−1. Thus taking t < 2ℓ invalidates the step |A ⇒ A ⇒ V| ≤ (t−1)d|A|, while t > 2ℓ weakens the bound. Hence t = 2ℓ is optimal within this framework.

Examples and constants

- Exact S_{k,2}: t_{k−i} = 2^{i+1} + (2^{i+1} − 1) = 2^{i+2} − 1, so S_{k,2} = ∑_{i=0}^{k−1} (2^{i+2} − 1) = 4·2^{k} − 4 − k. Thus δ^+(G) ≥ d(Π) + 4·2^{k} − 4 − k suffices in the Π-setting for ℓ=2.
- Ray packing: |V(B)| = (ℓ^{k+1} − 1)/(ℓ − 1) is exact and can be significantly smaller than the coarse 2ℓ^k used earlier; using it tightens h by Θ(ℓ^k).

Obstacles

- Further reducing S_{k,ℓ} below the term |V(B_i)| + ℓ|L_i| at each level likely requires a simultaneous b-matching across all leaves (nibble) with control of right-hand degrees and codegrees in the auxiliary bipartite graphs. Without extra pseudorandomness assumptions, Hall-type conditions are hard to certify from minimum out-degree alone.
- The ray-packing bound appears near-tight for greedy selection; global packing could shave lower-order terms but seems to require additional structural input.

Next steps

- Develop a global b-matching (or nibble) lemma for the level-i auxiliary bipartite graphs H_i (left L_i, right Γ(k−i−1)), to replace the per-leaf greedy step. Target: t_{k−i} ≥ (1+o(1))ℓ^{i+1}, hence S_{k,ℓ} = (1+o_ℓ(1))·C(ℓ)·ℓ^k with C(ℓ) as small as possible.
- Globalize the ray packing via randomized selections across all S(w) in parallel, aiming at h = (1+o(1))kℓ^{k+1}.
- Seek improved bounds on f(k,h) for Π = “centre of S^-_{k,h}” (e.g., polynomial in h for fixed k), which would translate the structural improvements above into substantially smaller δ^+-thresholds for T(k,ℓ).
