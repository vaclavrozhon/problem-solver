# Ideas

We present three verifiable refinements that strengthen the paper’s quantitative bounds and fix a subtlety in the k=2 case.

- Variable-threshold outstar-with-δ+-common-leaves: sharpen the additive term S_{k,ℓ} to Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k), independent of k, with an explicit bound S_{k,ℓ} ≤ (ℓ^2/(ℓ−1)^2)·ℓ^k + O(ℓ^k) (recovering the exact T_{k,2}=4·2^k−k−5 for ℓ=2). The lexicographic partition and greedy extension proofs adapt as in the paper, but with level-dependent thresholds.
- Ray packing at the leaves: improve the required spider height to h ≥ kℓ^{k+1} + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ, strictly sharpening both 3kℓ^{k+1} and kℓ^{k+1}+2ℓ^k+ℓ.
- k=2 spiders: optimize the partition parameter to τ=2 in the predecessor matching argument to obtain s ≥ ((d−1)(d−2ℓ+1))/d, implying δ^+ > (3ℓ + √(9ℓ^2 − 8ℓ + 4))/2 suffices for S^-_{2,ℓ} — a strict improvement over (3+√17)/2·ℓ.

# 1) Out-arborescences with δ+-common leaves: variable thresholds

Let P be a δ^+-common property with threshold d(P), and fix k≥1, ℓ≥2. Define Γ(0)= {v: v satisfies P}, and for 1≤i≤k, set Γ(i)= { v: deg^+_{Γ(i−1)}(v) ≥ t_i } with thresholds
- t_k := ℓ,
- t_{k−i} := ℓ^{i+1} + ⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉ for 1≤i≤k−1.

These thresholds ensure that at depth i (with |V(B_i)|=(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) vertices already used), every leaf has at least ℓ^{i+1} fresh candidates in Γ(k−i−1), enabling a disjoint ℓ-extension per leaf.

Claim 1 (Level-set contradiction). If δ^+(G) ≥ d(P) + ∑_{i=1}^k t_i, then Γ(k)≠∅.

Proof sketch. As in the paper’s lexicographic partition proof: for minimal nonempty class z, set W=⋃_{i: z_{i+1}=0} Γ(i). For v∈V_z, deg^+_W(v) < ∑_{i: z_{i+1}=0} t_{i+1}. If z≠⃗0 this contradicts δ^+(G). If z=⃗0, then δ^+(G[X]) ≥ d(P) on X=V_{⃗0}, so some x∈X satisfies P (anti-monotonicity), contradiction.

Claim 2 (Greedy construction). From any v∈Γ(k), build B_0={v} and inductively extend to B_{i+1} by giving each leaf of B_i ℓ new, pairwise-disjoint children in Γ(k−i−1), avoiding V(B_i). The thresholds guarantee feasibility since t_{k−i}−|V(B_i)| ≥ ℓ^{i+1}.

Theorem A (Refined outstar-with-δ+-common-leaves). If δ^+(G) ≥ d(P) + T_{k,ℓ}, where
T_{k,ℓ} := t_k + ∑_{i=1}^{k−1} t_{k−i} = ℓ + ∑_{i=1}^{k−1} [ℓ^{i+1} + ⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉],
then G contains a copy of B^+_{k,ℓ} whose leaves all satisfy P.

Explicit bound. Write S_1=∑_{i=1}^{k−1}ℓ^{i+1}=(ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ^2)/(ℓ−1) and S_2=∑_{i=1}^{k−1}⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉ ≤ (ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ^2)/(ℓ−1)^2 + O(k). Hence
T_{k,ℓ} ≤ ℓ + (ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ^2)/(ℓ−1) + (ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ^2)/(ℓ−1)^2 + O(k) = (ℓ^2/(ℓ−1)^2)·ℓ^k + O(ℓ^k) + O(k).
For ℓ=2 one checks T_{k,2}=4·2^k−k−5 exactly.

# 2) Improved ray packing for T(k,ℓ)

Let B≅B^+_{k,ℓ} with leaf set L (|L|=ℓ^k). For each w∈L, let S(w)≅S^-_{k,h} rooted at w. When choosing S′(w)≅S^-_{k,ℓ} greedily, each previously used vertex lies on at most one ray of S(w), since the rays are internally disjoint.

At the time of selecting S′(w):
- B blocks ≤ |V(B)|−1 rays, with |V(B)|=(ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1).
- Previously chosen S′(w′) (over at most ℓ^k−1 leaves) block ≤ kℓ(ℓ^k−1) rays.
Thus fewer than kℓ^{k+1} + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) rays are blocked, so it suffices that
h ≥ kℓ^{k+1} + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ.
This improves both 3kℓ^{k+1} and kℓ^{k+1}+2ℓ^k+ℓ. Combining with Theorem A (taking P = “centre of S^-_{k,h}”) yields δ^+(G) ≥ f(k,h)+T_{k,ℓ} ⇒ T(k,ℓ) ⊂ G.

# 3) k=2 spiders: optimizing the matching bound via τ=2

We refine the predecessor matching approach using an adjustable threshold τ for B.

Setup. Let G=(V,E) with deg^+(v)≡d. For τ≥2 define A={v: deg^-(v)≥τ} and B=V\A. If ∃ r∈A with deg^-_A(r)≥2ℓ we greedily build S^-_{2,ℓ}. Otherwise, deg^-_A(·)≤2ℓ−1 on A.

Counting distinct-vertex 2-walks (as in the paper, but with (d−1) for the second step):
- |A→V→V| ≥ |A|·d(d−1).
- |A→A→V| ≤ e(G[A])(d−1) ≤ (2ℓ−1)|A|(d−1).
- |B→B→V| ≥ e(G[B])(d−1), and |V→B→B| ≤ e(G[B])(τ−1).
Hence
|V→B→A| ≥ |A|(d−1)(d−2ℓ+1) + e(G[B])(d−τ) ≥ |A|(d−1)(d−2ℓ+1).
By averaging there exists a∈A with
t := |V→B→{a}| ≥ (d−1)(d−2ℓ+1).

Matching step (standard). In the bipartite graph H with left L=V\{a} and right R=N^-_B(a), let M be a maximum matching, with matched sets Q⊂L, S⊂R, s=|S|. Then no edges join L\Q to R\S (else an augmenting path exists). Thus every 2-walk via R\S starts in Q.

We bound t by splitting through S and B\S:
- Via S: |V→S→{a}| ≤ ∑_{b∈S} deg^-(b) ≤ (τ−1)s.
- Via B\S: |Q→(B\S)→{a}| ≤ ∑_{q∈Q} deg^+_{B\S}(q) ≤ s(d−1) (each q has ≥1 neighbor in S).
Therefore t ≤ s(d+τ−2), so
s ≥ t/(d+τ−2) ≥ (d−1)(d−2ℓ+1)/(d+τ−2).
Choosing τ=2 minimizes the denominator and yields
s ≥ (d−1)(d−2ℓ+1)/d.
Thus s≥ℓ (and hence S^-_{2,ℓ}⊂G) whenever
(d−1)(d−2ℓ+1) ≥ ℓ d ⟺ d^2 − 3ℓ d + 2ℓ − 1 ≥ 0.
Equivalently,
δ^+(G) > d_{*}(ℓ):= (3ℓ + √(9ℓ^2 − 8ℓ + 4))/2
suffices to force S^-_{2,ℓ}.

This strictly improves the paper’s ((3+√17)/2)ℓ bound. The proof avoids the “maximality” gap by a clean maximum-matching argument and uses τ=2 to tighten the (τ−1)s term.

# Examples

- ℓ=2: d_{*}(2)= (6 + √24)/2 = 3+√6 ≈ 5.45 (improves ~7.12).
- ℓ=10: d_{*}(10)= (30 + √(900−80+4))/2 ≈ (30 + 28.84)/2 ≈ 29.42 (improves ~35.6).

# Obstacles

- The main bottleneck remains f(k,h) for S^-_{k,h}; any polynomial-in-h bound for fixed k would substantially improve the final δ^+ thresholds in T(k,ℓ).
- Our depth-by-depth construction incurs an additive term ⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉; a global matching/nibble across all leaves at each depth should reduce this toward (1+o_ℓ(1))ℓ^{i+1}.
- The ray-packing bound h ≥ kℓ^{k+1} + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ seems close to optimal for the local greedy method; global packing could plausibly lower it to (1+o(1))kℓ^{k+1}.

# Next steps

- Develop a global matching at each depth i: create a bipartite graph between the ℓ^{i+1} “child slots” and Γ(k−i−1) with degrees guaranteed by the t_{k−i} thresholds; verify Hall’s condition up to o(ℓ^{i+1}) deficit to reduce the overhead term.
- Attempt a polynomial (in h) proof for f(k,h) via layering and expansion in min out-degree digraphs; even h^{O(k)} would materially sharpen the main theorem’s δ^+.
- For k=2, investigate whether variance bounds on |V→B→{a}| can replace (d−1) by d in the numerator while retaining d in the denominator, aiming at d ≥ ((3ℓ−1)+√(17ℓ^2−10ℓ+1))/2 or better.

# Notes for the verifier

- Theorem A: the lexicographic and greedy arguments mirror the paper’s Theorem 3.4, with thresholds t_i as above. Base case uses t_k=ℓ.
- Ray packing bound: each used vertex blocks ≤1 ray in a fixed S(w); count |V(B)| and the kℓ vertices per previously selected S′(w′).
- k=2 refinement: the τ=2 choice is compatible with the greedy “easy” case (it only constrains B); the matching bound t ≤ s(d+τ−2) uses 2-walks directly, avoiding any edge-count correction term.
