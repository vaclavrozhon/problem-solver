Ideas

- Correct a flaw in the variable-threshold schedule: the sum S_{k,ℓ}=∑ t_i that the lexicographic argument demands is Θ(ℓ^{k+1}), not Θ(ℓ^k). Thus, the proposed schedule does not improve over the paper’s 2kℓ^k additive term; it is asymptotically worse for k≥2.
- Provide a clean uniform-threshold improvement: replace 2kℓ^k by k·(ℓ^k + (ℓ^k−1)/(ℓ−1)) = (1+1/(ℓ−1))kℓ^k + O(k), improving the constant 2 to 1+1/(ℓ−1) (strict for ℓ≥3).
- Refine the ray-packing bound by a −kℓ savings: h ≥ |V(B)| + (|L|−1)·kℓ + ℓ suffices, i.e., h ≥ kℓ^{k+1} − kℓ + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ.
- Repair and sharpen the k=2 spider bound: with a maximum matching, s ≥ d(d−2ℓ−1)/(d+2ℓ−1), yielding δ^+ ≥ ((2ℓ+1)+√(12ℓ^2−4ℓ+1))/2 = (1+√3)ℓ + O(1). This beats 3.56ℓ.

1) Variable-threshold schedule is Θ(ℓ^{k+1}), not Θ(ℓ^k)

Let t_i := ℓ^{i} + ⌈(ℓ^{i}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉ for i=1,…,k (this is the schedule suggested, up to index shifts). Then
S_{k,ℓ} = ∑_{i=1}^k t_i = ∑_{i=1}^k ℓ^{i} + ∑_{i=1}^k ⌈(ℓ^{i}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉.
Bounding ceilings by +1,
S_{k,ℓ} ≤ (ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ)/(ℓ−1) + (ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ)/(ℓ−1)^2 − k/(ℓ−1) + k
= ℓ(ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ)/(ℓ−1)^2 + ((ℓ−2)/(ℓ−1))k = Θ(ℓ^{k+1}).
Thus this schedule cannot remove the linear-in-k factor; it increases the asymptotic dependence to ℓ^{k+1}.

2) Outstar-with-δ+-common-leaves: uniform-threshold improvement

Theorem. Let ℓ≥2, k≥1, and P be δ+-common with threshold d(P). Set M:=(ℓ^k−1)/(ℓ−1) and β:=ℓ^k+M. If δ^+(G) ≥ d(P) + kβ, then G contains B^+_{k,ℓ} whose leaves all satisfy P in G.

Proof (audit-ready). Define Γ(0):={v: v satisfies P} and for i≥1, Γ(i):={v: deg^+_{Γ(i−1)}(v) ≥ β}. The lexicographic partition argument shows Γ(k)≠∅ when δ^+ ≥ d(P)+∑_{i=1}^k β. Greedy construction: build B_i from v∈Γ(k). At stage i (0≤i≤k−1), leaves L⊆Γ(k−i) satisfy for each w∈L: deg^+_{Γ(k−i−1)}(w) ≥ β. Since |V(B_i)|=1+ℓ+⋯+ℓ^{i} = (ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) ≤ M, each w has at least β−|V(B_i)| ≥ ℓ^k available neighbours in Γ(k−i−1)\V(B_i). With |L| ≤ ℓ^{k−1}, a greedy packing assigns to each w a disjoint ℓ-set of out-neighbours (when assigning the j-th ℓ-set, at most (j−1)ℓ ≤ ℓ^k−ℓ vertices are used, leaving ≥ℓ). This yields B_{i+1} with leaves in Γ(k−i−1). After k steps, the leaves lie in Γ(0) and satisfy P.

Comment. This improves the paper’s 2kℓ^k to (1+1/(ℓ−1))kℓ^k+O(k); for ℓ=2 the constants tie, for ℓ≥3 the constant strictly drops.

3) Refined ray-packing for T(k,ℓ)

Lemma (−kℓ improvement). Let B≅B^+_{k,ℓ} have leaf set L, |L|=ℓ^k. For each w∈L, let S(w)≅S^-_{k,h} centered at w. If
h ≥ |V(B)| + (|L|−1)·kℓ + ℓ,
then one can choose pairwise vertex-disjoint subspiders S′(w)≅S^-_{k,ℓ}, all disjoint from B save at their centers.

Proof. Process leaves in any order. When choosing S′(w), the occupied vertices lie in B and in previously chosen S′’s (at most |L|−1 of them), contributing at most |V(B)|−1 + m·kℓ occupied non-centers (m≤|L|−1). Each occupied vertex that lies in S(w) blocks one ray (all non-centers of S(w) lie on exactly one ray), and vertices outside S(w) block none. Thus ≤ |V(B)|−1 + m·kℓ rays are blocked. If h ≥ |V(B)| + (|L|−1)·kℓ + ℓ, then at least ℓ rays remain for S′(w). Proceeding greedily gives the claim.

Corollary. With |V(B)|=(ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) and |L|=ℓ^k, it suffices to take
h ≥ kℓ^{k+1} − kℓ + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ.
This strictly improves h ≥ kℓ^{k+1} + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ by kℓ and the paper’s 3kℓ^{k+1} by a factor ~3.

4) k=2 spiders: rigorous linear bound with matching

Setup. Let δ^+(G)=d and partition V=A∪B where A={v: deg^−(v)≥2ℓ}, B={v: deg^−(v)≤2ℓ−1}. If some r∈A has deg^−_A(r)≥2ℓ, a greedy construction gives S^-_{2,ℓ}. Else, deg^−_A(·)≤2ℓ−1 on A. As in the paper, count 2-edge directed paths (with 3 distinct vertices) X→Y→Z.

Claim 4.1. There exists a∈A with T:=|V→B→{a}| ≥ d(d−2ℓ).

Proof. The paper’s decomposition
|V→B→A| = |A→V→V| − |A→A→V| + |B→B→V| − |V→B→B|
with the estimates (using “no-loops”, exclude 2-cycles once):
|A→V→V| ≥ |A|·d(d−1), |A→A→V| ≤ e(G[A])·d ≤ (2ℓ−1)d|A|,
|B→B→V| ≥ (d−1)e(G[B]), |V→B→B| ≤ (2ℓ−1)e(G[B])
implies |V→B→A| ≥ (d−2ℓ)[d|A| + e(G[B])] ≥ d(d−2ℓ)|A|. Averaging over A yields the stated a.

Build the predecessor bipartite graph H between U:=V\{a} and Y:=N^-_B(a), with edge set E(H)={q→b in G : q∈U, b∈Y}. Let s be a maximum matching size in H.

Claim 4.2. E(H) ≥ T − deg^+_Y(a).

Proof. T = ∑_{b∈Y} deg^−(b) counts all q→b→a, including those with q=a. Removing the at most deg^+_Y(a) such edges leaves E(H).

Claim 4.3. E(H) ≤ s(d+2ℓ−1).

Proof. Let M be a maximum matching, covering Q⊆U and S⊆Y with |Q|=|S|=s. By maximality, no edges between (U\Q) and (Y\S). Hence all edges either go into S or originate in Q. The number of edges with heads in S is ≤ ∑_{b∈S} deg^−(b) ≤ (2ℓ−1)s. The number of edges with tails in Q is ≤ ∑_{q∈Q} deg^+(q) ≤ sd. Summing gives the bound.

Combine. Since T ≥ d(d−2ℓ) and deg^+_Y(a) ≤ d,
E(H) ≥ d(d−2ℓ) − d = d(d−2ℓ−1).
With E(H) ≤ s(d+2ℓ−1), we get
s ≥ d(d−2ℓ−1)/(d+2ℓ−1).
Any matching of size s yields S^-_{2,s} (disjoint pairs q_i→b_i→a). Thus, s≥ℓ holds if and only if
d^2 − (2ℓ+1)d − ℓ(2ℓ−1) ≥ 0.
The positive root is
d_*(ℓ) = ((2ℓ+1) + √(12ℓ^2 − 4ℓ + 1))/2 = (1+√3)ℓ + O(1).
Therefore δ^+ > d_*(ℓ) suffices for S^-_{2,ℓ}. This improves the paper’s ≈3.56ℓ threshold.

Examples/Checks

- ℓ=2: d_*(2) = (5 + √(41))/2 ≈ (5 + 6.403)/2 ≈ 5.701. Paper’s bound gives ≈7.12.
- ℓ=3: d_*(3) = (7 + √(97))/2 ≈ (7 + 9.849)/2 ≈ 8.424, vs paper’s ≈10.68.

Obstacles

- The lexicographic partition method inevitably sums all level thresholds; any variable schedule that enforces per-level availability ℓ^{i+1} leads to S_{k,ℓ}=Θ(ℓ^{k+1}). Achieving S_{k,ℓ}=Θ(ℓ^k) appears to require a different global selection (e.g., semi-random nibble) rather than per-vertex level thresholds.
- For ray packing, our −kℓ saving is tight for this greedy process; larger improvements seem to need a global packing via hypergraph matchings.

Next steps

- Develop a semi-random levelwise assignment to reduce per-leaf degree requirements from ℓ^k to (1+ε)ℓ^{i+1} with overlap control, aiming for S_{k,ℓ} ≈ C(ℓ)ℓ^k with no factor k.
- Globalize ray packing using hypergraph matching (Pippenger–Spencer) to bring h down to (1+o(1))kℓ^{k+1}.
- Revisit f(k,h) from Aboulker et al. for k fixed: any polynomial bound in h would make the above structural improvements translate to markedly smaller δ^+ thresholds for T(k,ℓ).
