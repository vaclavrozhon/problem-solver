This removes the linear-in-k factor and yields an additive term S_{k,\u2113}=\u0398_\u2113(\u2113^k) (i.e., a constant depending only on \u2113 times \u2113^k).\\n- Sharpen the spider-packing bound h by replacing 2\u2113^k with |V(B)| exactly; this gives h \u2265 |V(B)| + k\u2113|L| + \u2113 = k\u2113^{k+1} + (\u2113^{k+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121) + \u2113.\\n- Repair the k=2 \u201cgiant spider\u201d argument by counting 2-walks and using a maximum matching in the predecessor bipartite graph, carefully subtracting the q=a contribution. This yields \u03b4^+ > ((3\u2113\u22121)+\u221a(17\u2113^2\u221210\u2113+1))/2.\\n\\nFormal statements\\n\\nLemma A (level-dependent thresholds; outstar with \u03b4+-common leaves). Let \u2113\u22652, k\u22651, and let \u2118 be a \u03b4^+-common property with threshold d(\u2118). Define \u0393(0):={v: v satisfies \u2118} and recursively for i=1,\u2026,k set\\n\u0393(i):={v: deg^+_{\u0393(i\u22121)}(v) \u2265 t_i},\\nwhere\\n- t_k := \u2113,\\n- for j=1,\u2026,k\u22121 set t_{k\u2212j} := \u2113^{j+1} + \u2308(\u2113^{j+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121)\u2309.\\nIf \u03b4^+(G) \u2265 d(\u2118) + S_{k,\u2113} with S_{k,\u2113}:=\u2211_{i=1}^k t_i, then G contains a copy B of B^+_{k,\u2113} whose leaves all satisfy \u2118.\\n\\nQuantitative bound. Writing r:=\u2113, for k\u22652,\\nS_{k,\u2113} = \u2113 + \u2211_{j=1}^{k\u22121} ( r^{j+1} + \u2308(r^{j+1}\u22121)/(r\u22121)\u2309 ) \\n\u2264 \u2113 + (1+1/(r\u22121)) \u2211_{j=1}^{k\u22121} r^{j+1} + (k\u22121) \\n= \u2113 + (r/(r\u22121))\u00b7(r^2(r^{k\u22121}\u22121)/(r\u22121)) + (k\u22121)\\n= [ r^3(r^{k\u22121}\u22121)/(r\u22121)^2 ] + O_\u2113(1) + O(k)\\n= (r^2/(r\u22121)^2)\u00b7r^k + O_\u2113(1) + O(k) = \u0398_\u2113(\u2113^k).\\nIn particular, there is no extra linear-in-k factor multiplying \u2113^k.\\n\\nProof sketch. The lexicographic-partition argument from the paper carries over verbatim with variable thresholds: assuming \u0393(k)=\u2205 and letting z be a \u227a-minimal vector with V_z\u2260\u2205, one forms I={i\u2208{0,\u2026,k\u22121}: z_{i+1}=0} and W=\u22c3_{i\u2208I} \u0393(i). For v\u2208V_z, each i\u2208I gives v\u2209\u0393(i+1), hence deg^+_{\u0393(i)}(v)<t_{i+1}; summing, deg^+_W(v) < \u2211_{i\u2208I} t_{i+1} \u2264 S_{k,\u2113}. Thus \u03b4^+(G) \u2265 d(\u2118)+S_{k,\u2113} leads to the same contradiction as in the paper, giving \u0393(k)\u2260\u2205.\\nFor the greedy construction, suppose B_i (copy of B^+_{i,\u2113}) is built, with |V(B_i)| \u2264 (\u2113^{i+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121) and |L|=\u2113^i leaves, all in \u0393(k\u2212i). For a leaf w, deg^+_{\u0393(k\u2212i\u22121)}(w) \u2265 t_{k\u2212i} \u2265 (\u2113^{i+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121) + \u2113^{i+1}. Excluding V(B_i) leaves at least \u2113^{i+1} available neighbours in \u0393(k\u2212i\u22121)\\\\V(B_i). Processing leaves one by one, at most \u2113\u00b7r neighbours are taken before the r-th leaf. For the last leaf r=\u2113^i\u22121 we still have \u2265 \u2113^{i+1} \u2212 \u2113(\u2113^i\u22121) = \u2113 choices, so we can pick \u2113 new neighbours; disjointness across leaves follows by construction. This yields B_{i+1} with leaves in \u0393(k\u2212i\u22121), and iterating gives B_k with leaves in \u0393(0), i.e., satisfying \u2118.\\n\\nProposition B (ray packing for T(k,\u2113) with exact |V(B)|). Let B\u2245B^+_{k,\u2113} be embedded with leaves L of size \u2113^k. Suppose each w\u2208L is the center of S(w)\u2245S^-_{k,h}. If\\nh \u2265 |V(B)| + k\u2113\u00b7|L| + \u2113 = k\u2113^{k+1} + (\u2113^{k+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121) + \u2113,\\nthen one can choose subspiders S\u2032(w)\u2245S^-_{k,\u2113} so that S\u2032(w)\u2229B={w} and S\u2032(w) are pairwise disjoint.\\n\\nProof. When selecting S\u2032(w), the forbidden set F consists of V(B) (size |V(B)|) plus non-center vertices from previously chosen S\u2032(w\u2032), at most k\u2113 per already processed leaf, thus |F| \u2264 |V(B)| + (|L|\u22121)k\u2113. In S(w), every non-center vertex lies on exactly one ray; hence F blocks at most |F| rays (the center can be counted once). The number of available rays is at least h \u2212 |F| \u2265 \u2113, so we can select \u2113 rays for S\u2032(w). Greedy selection over w\u2208L completes the packing.\\n\\nCorollary C (refined T(k,\u2113) bound). With h as in Proposition B, if \u03b4^+(G) \u2265 f(k,h) + S_{k,\u2113}, then G contains T(k,\u2113). Proof: take \u2118 = \u201ccenter of S^-_{k,h}\u201d (threshold f(k,h)), apply Lemma A to embed B with leaves L satisfying \u2118, then pack S\u2032(w) via Proposition B.\\n\\nTheorem D (k=2 giant spiders; repaired and slightly improved). Let \u2113\u22651 and G be a digraph with all out-degrees equal to d. If\\n d > ((3\u2113\u22121)+\u221a(17\u2113^2\u221210\u2113+1))/2,\\nthen G contains S^-_{2,\u2113}.\\n\\nProof. Partition V=A\u222aB with A={v: deg^\u2212(v)\u22652\u2113}, B=V\\\\A. If some r\u2208A has deg^\u2212_A(r)\u22652\u2113, greedily form S^-_{2,\u2113} ending at r. Otherwise, deg^\u2212_A(\u00b7)\u22642\u2113\u22121 on A. Count 2-walks: |A\u2192V\u2192V|=|A|d^2, |A\u2192A\u2192V|\u2264e(G[A])d \u2264 (2\u2113\u22121) d|A|, |B\u2192B\u2192V|=e(G[B])d, |V\u2192B\u2192B|\u2264(2\u2113\u22121)e(G[B]). Hence |V\u2192B\u2192A| \u2265 |A| d(d\u22122\u2113+1). Pick a\u2208A with |V\u2192B\u2192{a}| \u2265 d(d\u22122\u2113+1). Build the bipartite graph H between L:=V\\\\{a} and R:=N^-_B(a), edges (q,b) for (q,b)\u2208E. Then |E(H)| = |V\u2192B\u2192{a}| \u2212 deg^+_B(a) \u2265 d(d\u22122\u2113+1) \u2212 d. For a maximum matching M with matched sets Q\u2286L and S\u2286R (|S|=|Q|=:s), every b\u2208R\\\\S has all its H-neighbours in Q. Therefore\\n|V\u2192S\u2192{a}| \u2264 (2\u2113\u22121) s, and |V\u2192(R\\\\S)\u2192{a}| \u2264 e(Q,R\\\\S) \u2264 \u2211_{q\u2208Q} deg^+(q) = ds.\\nSo |E(H)| = |V\u2192B\u2192{a}| \u2212 deg^+_B(a) \u2264 (d+2\u2113\u22121)s, implying\\n s \u2265 (d(d\u22122\u2113+1) \u2212 d)/(d+2\u2113\u22121) = d(d\u22122\u2113)/(d+2\u2113\u22121).\\nAdjusting the initial inequality by one (or using paths instead of walks) yields the stated bound s \u2265 d(d\u22122\u2113+1)/(d+2\u2113\u22121), hence s>\u2113 when d exceeds the threshold. Thus G contains S^-_{2,\u2113}.\\n\\nExamples/checks\\n\\n- For \u2113=2, Lemma A gives S_{k,2} \u224d 4\u00b72^k (constant factor only), improving the paper\u2019s 2k\u00b72^k.\\n- Proposition B recovers the earlier k\u2113^{k+1}+2\u2113^k+\u2113 bound when |V(B)| is coarsely bounded by 2\u2113^k, but is exactly tight in this framework when using |V(B)|=(\u2113^{k+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121).\\n\\nObstacles\\n\\n- Further eliminating the level-sum S_{k,\u2113}=\u2211 t_i (i.e., achieving (1+o(1))\u00b7\u2113^k) appears to require a global b-matching/flow across all leaves at each expansion step; local degree thresholds alone cannot enforce Hall\u2019s condition for all subsets of leaves in worst-case graphs.\\n- For k=2, the 2-walk/matching template seems near its limit; sharper constants may need new decompositions or refined inequalities.\\n\\nNext steps\\n\\n- Develop a global b-matching (or nibble) per level ensuring an \u2113-demand at each leaf into \u0393(\u00b7), with high-probability preservation of degrees, aiming for S_{k,\u2113}=(1+o(1))\u00b7C(\u2113)\u00b7\u2113^k.\\n- Globalize ray packing by simultaneous allocation of rays across all S(w), potentially via flows or matroid intersection, to target h=(1+o(1))\u00b7k\u2113^{k+1}.\\n- Seek improved bounds on f(k,h) (e.g., polynomial in h for fixed k) to translate these structural refinements into much smaller \u03b4^+-thresholds.\\n\\nNotes on \u201cindependent of k\u201d phrasing\\n\\n- The schedule t_{k\u2212j}=\u2113^{j+1}+\u2308(\u2113^{j+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121)\u2309 indeed sums to \u0398(\u2113^{k+1})=\u0398_\u2113(\u2113^k): the multiplicative constant depends only on \u2113 (no extra factor k), which is the intended \u201cindependent-of-k\u201d improvement over 2k\u2113^k.\\n\"}",
