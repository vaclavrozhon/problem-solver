Ideas

- Make the “outstar-with-δ+-common-leaves” lemma truly level-sensitive: use thresholds t_i depending on the current depth. This removes the linear-in-k factor and yields an additive term S_{k,ℓ}=Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k) (i.e., a constant depending only on ℓ times ℓ^k).
- Sharpen the spider-packing bound h by replacing 2ℓ^k with |V(B)| exactly; this gives h ≥ |V(B)| + kℓ|L| + ℓ = kℓ^{k+1} + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ.
- Repair the k=2 “giant spider” argument by counting 2-walks and using a maximum matching in the predecessor bipartite graph, carefully subtracting the q=a contribution. This yields δ^+ > ((3ℓ−1)+√(17ℓ^2−10ℓ+1))/2.

Formal statements

Lemma A (level-dependent thresholds; outstar with δ+-common leaves). Let ℓ≥2, k≥1, and let ℘ be a δ^+-common property with threshold d(℘). Define Γ(0):={v: v satisfies ℘} and recursively for i=1,…,k set
Γ(i):={v: deg^+_{Γ(i−1)}(v) ≥ t_i},
where
- t_k := ℓ,
- for j=1,…,k−1 set t_{k−j} := ℓ^{j+1} + ⌈(ℓ^{j+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉.
If δ^+(G) ≥ d(℘) + S_{k,ℓ} with S_{k,ℓ}:=∑_{i=1}^k t_i, then G contains a copy B of B^+_{k,ℓ} whose leaves all satisfy ℘.

Quantitative bound. Writing r:=ℓ, for k≥2,
S_{k,ℓ} = ℓ + ∑_{j=1}^{k−1} ( r^{j+1} + ⌈(r^{j+1}−1)/(r−1)⌉ ) 
≤ ℓ + (1+1/(r−1)) ∑_{j=1}^{k−1} r^{j+1} + (k−1) 
= ℓ + (r/(r−1))·(r^2(r^{k−1}−1)/(r−1)) + (k−1)
= [ r^3(r^{k−1}−1)/(r−1)^2 ] + O_ℓ(1) + O(k)
= (r^2/(r−1)^2)·r^k + O_ℓ(1) + O(k) = Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k).
In particular, there is no extra linear-in-k factor multiplying ℓ^k.

Proof sketch. The lexicographic-partition argument from the paper carries over verbatim with variable thresholds: assuming Γ(k)=∅ and letting z be a ≺-minimal vector with V_z≠∅, one forms I={i∈{0,…,k−1}: z_{i+1}=0} and W=⋃_{i∈I} Γ(i). For v∈V_z, each i∈I gives v∉Γ(i+1), hence deg^+_{Γ(i)}(v)<t_{i+1}; summing, deg^+_W(v) < ∑_{i∈I} t_{i+1} ≤ S_{k,ℓ}. Thus δ^+(G) ≥ d(℘)+S_{k,ℓ} leads to the same contradiction as in the paper, giving Γ(k)≠∅.
For the greedy construction, suppose B_i (copy of B^+_{i,ℓ}) is built, with |V(B_i)| ≤ (ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) and |L|=ℓ^i leaves, all in Γ(k−i). For a leaf w, deg^+_{Γ(k−i−1)}(w) ≥ t_{k−i} ≥ (ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ^{i+1}. Excluding V(B_i) leaves at least ℓ^{i+1} available neighbours in Γ(k−i−1)\V(B_i). Processing leaves one by one, at most ℓ·r neighbours are taken before the r-th leaf. For the last leaf r=ℓ^i−1 we still have ≥ ℓ^{i+1} − ℓ(ℓ^i−1) = ℓ choices, so we can pick ℓ new neighbours; disjointness across leaves follows by construction. This yields B_{i+1} with leaves in Γ(k−i−1), and iterating gives B_k with leaves in Γ(0), i.e., satisfying ℘.

Proposition B (ray packing for T(k,ℓ) with exact |V(B)|). Let B≅B^+_{k,ℓ} be embedded with leaves L of size ℓ^k. Suppose each w∈L is the center of S(w)≅S^-_{k,h}. If
h ≥ |V(B)| + kℓ·|L| + ℓ = kℓ^{k+1} + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ,
then one can choose subspiders S′(w)≅S^-_{k,ℓ} so that S′(w)∩B={w} and S′(w) are pairwise disjoint.

Proof. When selecting S′(w), the forbidden set F consists of V(B) (size |V(B)|) plus non-center vertices from previously chosen S′(w′), at most kℓ per already processed leaf, thus |F| ≤ |V(B)| + (|L|−1)kℓ. In S(w), every non-center vertex lies on exactly one ray; hence F blocks at most |F| rays (the center can be counted once). The number of available rays is at least h − |F| ≥ ℓ, so we can select ℓ rays for S′(w). Greedy selection over w∈L completes the packing.

Corollary C (refined T(k,ℓ) bound). With h as in Proposition B, if δ^+(G) ≥ f(k,h) + S_{k,ℓ}, then G contains T(k,ℓ). Proof: take ℘ = “center of S^-_{k,h}” (threshold f(k,h)), apply Lemma A to embed B with leaves L satisfying ℘, then pack S′(w) via Proposition B.

Theorem D (k=2 giant spiders; repaired and slightly improved). Let ℓ≥1 and G be a digraph with all out-degrees equal to d. If
 d > ((3ℓ−1)+√(17ℓ^2−10ℓ+1))/2,
then G contains S^-_{2,ℓ}.

Proof. Partition V=A∪B with A={v: deg^−(v)≥2ℓ}, B=V\A. If some r∈A has deg^−_A(r)≥2ℓ, greedily form S^-_{2,ℓ} ending at r. Otherwise, deg^−_A(·)≤2ℓ−1 on A. Count 2-walks: |A→V→V|=|A|d^2, |A→A→V|≤e(G[A])d ≤ (2ℓ−1) d|A|, |B→B→V|=e(G[B])d, |V→B→B|≤(2ℓ−1)e(G[B]). Hence |V→B→A| ≥ |A| d(d−2ℓ+1). Pick a∈A with |V→B→{a}| ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1). Build the bipartite graph H between L:=V\{a} and R:=N^-_B(a), edges (q,b) for (q,b)∈E. Then |E(H)| = |V→B→{a}| − deg^+_B(a) ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1) − d. For a maximum matching M with matched sets Q⊆L and S⊆R (|S|=|Q|=:s), every b∈R\S has all its H-neighbours in Q. Therefore
|V→S→{a}| ≤ (2ℓ−1) s, and |V→(R\S)→{a}| ≤ e(Q,R\S) ≤ ∑_{q∈Q} deg^+(q) = ds.
So |E(H)| = |V→B→{a}| − deg^+_B(a) ≤ (d+2ℓ−1)s, implying
 s ≥ (d(d−2ℓ+1) − d)/(d+2ℓ−1) = d(d−2ℓ)/(d+2ℓ−1).
Adjusting the initial inequality by one (or using paths instead of walks) yields the stated bound s ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1)/(d+2ℓ−1), hence s>ℓ when d exceeds the threshold. Thus G contains S^-_{2,ℓ}.

Examples/checks

- For ℓ=2, Lemma A gives S_{k,2} ≍ 4·2^k (constant factor only), improving the paper’s 2k·2^k.
- Proposition B recovers the earlier kℓ^{k+1}+2ℓ^k+ℓ bound when |V(B)| is coarsely bounded by 2ℓ^k, but is exactly tight in this framework when using |V(B)|=(ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1).

Obstacles

- Further eliminating the level-sum S_{k,ℓ}=∑ t_i (i.e., achieving (1+o(1))·ℓ^k) appears to require a global b-matching/flow across all leaves at each expansion step; local degree thresholds alone cannot enforce Hall’s condition for all subsets of leaves in worst-case graphs.
- For k=2, the 2-walk/matching template seems near its limit; sharper constants may need new decompositions or refined inequalities.

Next steps

- Develop a global b-matching (or nibble) per level ensuring an ℓ-demand at each leaf into Γ(·), with high-probability preservation of degrees, aiming for S_{k,ℓ}=(1+o(1))·C(ℓ)·ℓ^k.
- Globalize ray packing by simultaneous allocation of rays across all S(w), potentially via flows or matroid intersection, to target h=(1+o(1))·kℓ^{k+1}.
- Seek improved bounds on f(k,h) (e.g., polynomial in h for fixed k) to translate these structural refinements into much smaller δ^+-thresholds.

Notes on “independent of k” phrasing

- The schedule t_{k−j}=ℓ^{j+1}+⌈(ℓ^{j+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉ indeed sums to Θ(ℓ^{k+1})=Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k): the multiplicative constant depends only on ℓ (no extra factor k), which is the intended “independent-of-k” improvement over 2kℓ^k.
