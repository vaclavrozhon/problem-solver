{"summary_md":"Refinements and fixes to the paper's main constructions. A level-dependent threshold schedule t_{k-i}=ℓ^{i+1}+⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉ yields S_{k,ℓ}=∑_i t_i = Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k) (no multiplicative k) with explicit bound S_{k,ℓ} ≤ ℓ(ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ)/(ℓ−1)^2 + ((ℓ−2)/(ℓ−1))k. Ray-packing is sharpened: it suffices that h ≥ |V(B)| + kℓ·|L| + ℓ, which for B≅B^+_{k,ℓ} gives h ≥ kℓ^{k+1} + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ. The k=2 case is repaired: counting 2-walks plus a maximum-matching argument yields s ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1)/(d+2ℓ−1) and the threshold d_*(ℓ)=((3ℓ−1)+√(17ℓ^2−10ℓ+1))/2 (fixing a gap in the paper). Next steps: global matching/nibble for child selection, globalize ray-packing, and improve f(k,h).
