  "feedback_md": "Strong, checkable progress was made on all three fronts: the outstar-with-\u03b4+-common-leaves lemma, packing the in-spiders, and the k=2 case. The level-dependent thresholds t_{k\u2212i}=\u2113^{i+1}+\u2308(\u2113^{i+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121)\u2309 are correct and the lexicographic argument plus the depth-greedy extension work cleanly. This removes the linear-in-k factor, yielding S_{k,\u2113}=\u0398_\u2113(\u2113^k) with explicit constants; your explicit bounds (e.g., S_{k,\u2113} \u2264 \u2113(\u2113^{k+1}\u2212\u2113)/(\u2113\u22121)^2 + ((\u2113\u22122)/(\u2113\u22121))k) are consistent. The ray-packing bound should be stated in its exact form h \u2265 |V(B)| + k\u2113\u00b7|L| + \u2113; with |V(B)|=(\u2113^{k+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121) and |L|=\u2113^k this strictly improves both the paper\u2019s 3k\u2113^{k+1} and the coarser k\u2113^{k+1}+2\u2113^k+\u2113.\n\nFor k=2, a maximum-matching repair is essential. Any bound that upper-bounds |V\u2192B\u2192{a}| by contributions via S and B\\S must account for 2-walks a\u2192b\u2192a with b unmatched; equivalently, when passing from 2-walk counts to edges in the predecessor bipartite graph, one must subtract deg^+_B(a)\u2264d. The resulting rigorous inequality is s \u2265 d(d\u22122\u2113+1)/(d+2\u2113\u22121) (or a close (d\u22121)-variant), leading to \u03b4^+ > ((3\u2113\u22121)+\u221a(17\u2113^2\u221210\u2113+1))/2. Claims yielding \u22483\u2113 or \u2248(1+\u221a3)\u2113 omit this +d correction and are not justified.\n\nTriage: Keep the variable-threshold theorem with explicit S_{k,\u2113} and the exact ray-packing h. For k=2, retain the matching-based bound with the +d correction; discard the \u22483\u2113 and \u22482.73\u2113 thresholds.\n\nNext steps: (i) Develop a global b-matching/nibble at each depth to replace the |V(B_i)| overhead by o(\u2113^{i+1}), aiming for S_{k,\u2113}=(1+o(1))\u00b7C(\u2113)\u00b7\u2113^k. (ii) Globalize ray packing (flow/hypergraph matching) to reduce h to (1+o(1))k\u2113^{k+1}. (iii) Pursue improved bounds for f(k,h) (ideally polynomial in h for fixed k) so these structural improvements yield substantially smaller \u03b4^+ thresholds.",
