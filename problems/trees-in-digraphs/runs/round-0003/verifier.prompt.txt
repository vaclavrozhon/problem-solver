=== SYSTEM ===
You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md, proofs.md, and output.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers

# Research Notes



Updates and insights

- Outstar-with-δ+-common-leaves: A level-dependent threshold schedule t_{k-i}=ℓ^{i+1}+⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉ yields a total additive term S_{k,ℓ}=∑_{i=1}^k t_i=Θ(ℓ^k), independent of k up to a constant depending only on ℓ. The lexicographic partition argument and greedy extension both adapt cleanly.
- Uniform vs variable thresholds: The uniform choice T*=⌈ℓ^k·ℓ/(ℓ−1)⌉ (repeated k times) also works but is weaker (cost kT*). The key sufficient condition at depth i is deg_{Γ(k−i−1)}(w) ≥ |V(B_i)|+ℓ^{i+1}, with |V(B_i)|=(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1).
- Packing rays: For attaching S^-_{k,ℓ} at each leaf, h ≥ kℓ^{k+1}+2ℓ^k+ℓ suffices: each previously used vertex blocks at most one ray in any fixed S(w), and |V(B)| ≤ (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) ≤ 2ℓ^k.
- k=2 spiders: Counting 2-walks and using a maximum matching between V\{a} and N^-_B(a) gives s ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1)/(d+2ℓ−1), implying δ^+ > ((3ℓ−1)+√(17ℓ^2−10ℓ+1))/2. This fixes a gap in the paper’s proof where a maximality implication was unjustified.

Next directions
- Attempt a global selection (matching/nibble) over all leaves to push S_{k,ℓ} to (1+o(1))ℓ^k.
- Globalize the ray packing to reduce h to (1+o(1))kℓ^{k+1}.
- Seek better bounds on f(k,h) (e.g., polynomial in h) to translate structural improvements into substantially smaller δ^+ thresholds.

Clarifications and refinements

- Variable thresholds: The schedule t_{k−i}=ℓ^{i+1}+⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉ yields S_{k,ℓ}=∑ t_i = Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k) (no linear-in-k factor). A sharper bound is
  S_{k,ℓ} ≤ ℓ(ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ)/(ℓ−1)^2 + ((ℓ−2)/(ℓ−1))k.
- Ray packing: Use the exact bound h ≥ |V(B)| + kℓ·|L| + ℓ. With |V(B)|=(ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) and |L|=ℓ^k this gives h ≥ kℓ^{k+1} + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ, improving the earlier kℓ^{k+1}+2ℓ^k+ℓ.
- k=2 correction: In the predecessor bipartite graph H (left V\{a}, right N^-_B(a)), |E(H)| = |V→B→{a}| − deg^+_B(a). Thus one must subtract ≤ d when lower-bounding |E(H)| from a 2-walk count. The valid matching bound is s ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1)/(d+2ℓ−1) (or a close (d−1)-variant), implying δ^+ > ((3ℓ−1)+√(17ℓ^2−10ℓ+1))/2. The ≈(1+√3)ℓ claim is not supported.

Targets
- Develop global (nibble/matching) selection at each depth to reduce the |V(B_i)| overhead toward (1+o(1))ℓ^{i+1} and aim for S_{k,ℓ}=(1+o(1))·C(ℓ)·ℓ^k.
- Globalize ray packing to reduce h to (1+o(1))kℓ^{k+1}.
- Improve f(k,h) (ideally polynomial in h for fixed k) to leverage these structural gains.

# Main Results

- Outstar-with-δ+-common-leaves (refined). For ℓ≥2, k≥1, and any δ+-common property P with threshold d(P), if
  δ^+(G) ≥ d(P) + S_{k,ℓ},
  where S_{k,ℓ}=∑_{i=1}^k t_i with t_k=ℓ and t_{k−i}=ℓ^{i+1}+⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉ (1≤i≤k−1), then G contains B^+_{k,ℓ} whose leaves all satisfy P. In particular, S_{k,ℓ}=Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k) (no factor k); e.g., S_{k,ℓ} ≤ ℓ(ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ)/(ℓ−1)^2 + O(k).

- Packing in-spiders at the leaves (refined h). It suffices to take
  h = kℓ^{k+1} + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ
  (improving the earlier kℓ^{k+1}+2ℓ^k+ℓ and the paper’s 3kℓ^{k+1}). Consequently, δ^+(G) ≥ f(k,h) + S_{k,ℓ} guarantees a copy of T(k,ℓ).

- k=2 Giant Spiders. Any digraph with
  δ^+ > ((3ℓ−1)+√(17ℓ^2−10ℓ+1))/2
  contains S^-_{2,ℓ}. This corrects the proof via a maximum-matching argument (accounting for 2-walks starting at a) and improves finite-ℓ constants while matching the (3+√17)/2 asymptotics.

Ideas

- Push the “outstar-with-δ+-common-leaves” theorem to a level-dependent schedule with an explicit, auditably sharp threshold per level, and compute a clean bound on the total additive overhead S_{k,ℓ} = Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k) with no linear-in-k factor.
- Tighten the ray-packing bound h by using the exact |V(B)|, not the coarse 2ℓ^k, keeping the same greedy framework.
- Repair and streamline the k=2 spider proof with a matching/vertex-cover argument that correctly accounts for 2-walks starting at a (subtracting ≤ d).
- Check if varying the A/B threshold (2ℓ → t) improves the k=2 constant; conclude this method is optimized at t=2ℓ.

Refinement 1: Outstar with δ+-common leaves (variable thresholds)

Theorem. Let Π be a δ^+-common vertex property with threshold d(Π). Fix ℓ ≥ 2, k ≥ 1. Define Γ(0) = {v : v satisfies Π} and, for 1 ≤ j ≤ k,
Γ(j) = { v : deg^+_{Γ(j−1)}(v) ≥ t_j },
where, for i = 0,…,k−1,
 t_{k−i} := ℓ^{i+1} + ⌈(ℓ^{i+1} − 1)/(ℓ − 1)⌉, and set t_k := ℓ.
If δ^+(G) ≥ d(Π) + S_{k,ℓ} with S_{k,ℓ} := ∑_{j=1}^k t_j, then G contains B ≅ B^+_{k,ℓ} whose leaves all satisfy Π.

Proof sketch (fully checkable). The lexicographic partition argument from the paper (Claim 3.8) carries through verbatim with thresholds t_j: assuming Γ(k)=∅, take the lexicographically minimal nonempty class V_z with z_k=0, let I := {i: z_{i+1}=0}, W := ⋃_{i∈I} Γ(i). Then for v ∈ V_z,
 deg^+_W(v) < ∑_{i∈I} t_{i+1} ≤ S_{k,ℓ}.
If z ≠ 0⃗, this contradicts δ^+(G) ≥ S_{k,ℓ}. If z = 0⃗, then for all v ∈ X := V \ ⋃_{j=0}^k Γ(j),
 deg^+_X(v) ≥ δ^+(G) − S_{k,ℓ} ≥ d(Π),
so X contains a Π-vertex, contradicting anti-monotonicity. Hence Γ(k) ≠ ∅.
Take v ∈ Γ(k). Build B_i ≅ B^+_{i,ℓ} inductively, with leaves L_i ⊆ Γ(k−i) and |V(B_i)| = (ℓ^{i+1} − 1)/(ℓ − 1), |L_i|=ℓ^i. To form B_{i+1}, for each w ∈ L_i select ℓ out-neighbours in Γ(k−i−1), avoiding V(B_i) and keeping choices across different w disjoint. In a greedy order, when treating the j-th leaf, at most |V(B_i)| + ℓ(j−1) neighbours are forbidden. Thus it suffices that every w has
 deg^+_{Γ(k−i−1)}(w) ≥ |V(B_i)| + ℓ|L_i| = (ℓ^{i+1} − 1)/(ℓ − 1) + ℓ^{i+1},
exactly ensured by t_{k−i}. For i=0, the bound t_k = ℓ is enough: B_1 is an out-star, so we only need ℓ out-neighbours of v in Γ(k−1). Thus B_k exists with leaves in Γ(0), i.e. satisfying Π.

Explicit bound on S_{k,ℓ}. Using ⌈x⌉ ≤ x+1 and summing r=1,…,k,
 S_{k,ℓ} = ∑_{r=1}^k (ℓ^r + ⌈(ℓ^r − 1)/(ℓ − 1)⌉)
 ≤ ∑_{r=1}^k ℓ^r + (1/(ℓ−1))∑_{r=1}^k (ℓ^r − 1) + k
 = ℓ(ℓ^{k+1} − ℓ)/(ℓ−1)^2 + ((ℓ−2)/(ℓ−1))k.
Hence S_{k,ℓ} = (ℓ^2/(ℓ−1)^2)·ℓ^k + O_ℓ(1), i.e. Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k) without a factor k.

Refinement 2: Packing the in-spiders at the leaves

Lemma (ray packing). Let B ≅ B^+_{k,ℓ} with leaves L (|L|=ℓ^k). For each w ∈ L let S(w) ≅ S^-_{k,h} centred at w. If
 h ≥ |V(B)| + kℓ·|L| + ℓ = (ℓ^{k+1} − 1)/(ℓ − 1) + kℓ^{k+1} + ℓ,
then one can choose pairwise vertex-disjoint S′(w) ≅ S^-_{k,ℓ}, each disjoint from B except at w.

Proof. Process L arbitrarily. Let U be the union of B and already chosen S′. In S(w), each vertex of U\{w} lies on at most one ray, so at most |U|−1 rays are blocked. As |U| ≤ |V(B)| + kℓ(|L|−1) at all steps, the stated h guarantees at least ℓ unblocked rays remain for w.

Corollary (T(k,ℓ) threshold). Let h* := (ℓ^{k+1} − 1)/(ℓ − 1) + kℓ^{k+1} + ℓ. If δ^+(G) ≥ f(k,h*) + S_{k,ℓ}, then G contains T(k,ℓ).

Proof. Take Π = “centre of S^-_{k,h*}”. Apply the Theorem to obtain B with all leaves satisfying Π, then the Lemma to attach disjoint S′(w).

Correction and strengthening for k=2 spiders

Theorem (k=2). Any digraph G with minimum out-degree d > d_*(ℓ) := ((3ℓ − 1) + √(17ℓ^2 − 10ℓ + 1))/2 contains S^-_{2,ℓ}.

Proof. Assume deg^+(v)=d for all v by edge deletions. Partition V into A := {deg^− ≥ 2ℓ} and B := V\A; if r ∈ A has deg^-_A(r) ≥ 2ℓ, greedily embed S^-_{2,ℓ}. Otherwise deg^-_A(·) ≤ 2ℓ−1 on A. Count directed 2-walks:
 |A ⇒ V ⇒ V| = |A| d^2;
 |A ⇒ A ⇒ V| ≤ d e(G[A]) ≤ (2ℓ−1)d|A|;
 |B ⇒ B ⇒ V| = d e(G[B]);
 |V ⇒ B ⇒ B| ≤ (2ℓ−1)e(G[B]).
Hence |V ⇒ B ⇒ A| ≥ |A| d(d − 2ℓ + 1) + e(G[B])(d − 2ℓ + 1) ≥ |A| d(d − 2ℓ + 1).
Pick a ∈ A with T := |V ⇒ B ⇒ {a}| ≥ d(d − 2ℓ + 1). Let R := N^-_B(a), U := V\{a}, and build the bipartite predecessor graph H with parts (U,R), edges q—b iff (q,b) ∈ E. We have |E(H)| = T − deg^+_B(a) ≥ d(d − 2ℓ + 1) − d. By Kőnig’s theorem, if s is the maximum matching size then there is a vertex cover C with |C|=s, so
 |E(H)| ≤ ∑_{q∈C∩U} deg^+(q) + ∑_{b∈C∩R} deg^−(b) ≤ d|C∩U| + (2ℓ−1)|C∩R| ≤ (d + 2ℓ − 1) s.
Therefore s ≥ (d(d − 2ℓ)) / (d + 2ℓ − 1). If s ≥ ℓ we obtain S^-_{2,ℓ}. Solving s ≥ ℓ yields d > d_*(ℓ).

Remark on optimality of the A/B threshold in this method

One can parametrize the partition threshold by t ∈ ℕ, letting A := {deg^− ≥ t}, B := V\A, and repeating the above argument. In place of 2ℓ we obtain s ≥ d(d − t)/(d + t − 1), leading to the constraint d(d − t) ≥ ℓ(d + t − 1). Since in the “easy” greedy case we only rule out deg^-_A(r) ≥ 2ℓ, the strongest a priori bound available in the “hard” case is deg^-_A(·) ≤ 2ℓ−1. Thus taking t < 2ℓ invalidates the step |A ⇒ A ⇒ V| ≤ (t−1)d|A|, while t > 2ℓ weakens the bound. Hence t = 2ℓ is optimal within this framework.

Examples and constants

- Exact S_{k,2}: t_{k−i} = 2^{i+1} + (2^{i+1} − 1) = 2^{i+2} − 1, so S_{k,2} = ∑_{i=0}^{k−1} (2^{i+2} − 1) = 4·2^{k} − 4 − k. Thus δ^+(G) ≥ d(Π) + 4·2^{k} − 4 − k suffices in the Π-setting for ℓ=2.
- Ray packing: |V(B)| = (ℓ^{k+1} − 1)/(ℓ − 1) is exact and can be significantly smaller than the coarse 2ℓ^k used earlier; using it tightens h by Θ(ℓ^k).

Obstacles

- Further reducing S_{k,ℓ} below the term |V(B_i)| + ℓ|L_i| at each level likely requires a simultaneous b-matching across all leaves (nibble) with control of right-hand degrees and codegrees in the auxiliary bipartite graphs. Without extra pseudorandomness assumptions, Hall-type conditions are hard to certify from minimum out-degree alone.
- The ray-packing bound appears near-tight for greedy selection; global packing could shave lower-order terms but seems to require additional structural input.

Next steps

- Develop a global b-matching (or nibble) lemma for the level-i auxiliary bipartite graphs H_i (left L_i, right Γ(k−i−1)), to replace the per-leaf greedy step. Target: t_{k−i} ≥ (1+o(1))ℓ^{i+1}, hence S_{k,ℓ} = (1+o_ℓ(1))·C(ℓ)·ℓ^k with C(ℓ) as small as possible.
- Globalize the ray packing via randomized selections across all S(w) in parallel, aiming at h = (1+o(1))kℓ^{k+1}.
- Seek improved bounds on f(k,h) for Π = “centre of S^-_{k,h}” (e.g., polynomial in h for fixed k), which would translate the structural improvements above into substantially smaller δ^+-thresholds for T(k,ℓ).

# Ideas

We present three verifiable refinements that strengthen the paper’s quantitative bounds and fix a subtlety in the k=2 case.

- Variable-threshold outstar-with-δ+-common-leaves: sharpen the additive term S_{k,ℓ} to Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k), independent of k, with an explicit bound S_{k,ℓ} ≤ (ℓ^2/(ℓ−1)^2)·ℓ^k + O(ℓ^k) (recovering the exact T_{k,2}=4·2^k−k−5 for ℓ=2). The lexicographic partition and greedy extension proofs adapt as in the paper, but with level-dependent thresholds.
- Ray packing at the leaves: improve the required spider height to h ≥ kℓ^{k+1} + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ, strictly sharpening both 3kℓ^{k+1} and kℓ^{k+1}+2ℓ^k+ℓ.
- k=2 spiders: optimize the partition parameter to τ=2 in the predecessor matching argument to obtain s ≥ ((d−1)(d−2ℓ+1))/d, implying δ^+ > (3ℓ + √(9ℓ^2 − 8ℓ + 4))/2 suffices for S^-_{2,ℓ} — a strict improvement over (3+√17)/2·ℓ.

# 1) Out-arborescences with δ+-common leaves: variable thresholds

Let P be a δ^+-common property with threshold d(P), and fix k≥1, ℓ≥2. Define Γ(0)= {v: v satisfies P}, and for 1≤i≤k, set Γ(i)= { v: deg^+_{Γ(i−1)}(v) ≥ t_i } with thresholds
- t_k := ℓ,
- t_{k−i} := ℓ^{i+1} + ⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉ for 1≤i≤k−1.

These thresholds ensure that at depth i (with |V(B_i)|=(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) vertices already used), every leaf has at least ℓ^{i+1} fresh candidates in Γ(k−i−1), enabling a disjoint ℓ-extension per leaf.

Claim 1 (Level-set contradiction). If δ^+(G) ≥ d(P) + ∑_{i=1}^k t_i, then Γ(k)≠∅.

Proof sketch. As in the paper’s lexicographic partition proof: for minimal nonempty class z, set W=⋃_{i: z_{i+1}=0} Γ(i). For v∈V_z, deg^+_W(v) < ∑_{i: z_{i+1}=0} t_{i+1}. If z≠⃗0 this contradicts δ^+(G). If z=⃗0, then δ^+(G[X]) ≥ d(P) on X=V_{⃗0}, so some x∈X satisfies P (anti-monotonicity), contradiction.

Claim 2 (Greedy construction). From any v∈Γ(k), build B_0={v} and inductively extend to B_{i+1} by giving each leaf of B_i ℓ new, pairwise-disjoint children in Γ(k−i−1), avoiding V(B_i). The thresholds guarantee feasibility since t_{k−i}−|V(B_i)| ≥ ℓ^{i+1}.

Theorem A (Refined outstar-with-δ+-common-leaves). If δ^+(G) ≥ d(P) + T_{k,ℓ}, where
T_{k,ℓ} := t_k + ∑_{i=1}^{k−1} t_{k−i} = ℓ + ∑_{i=1}^{k−1} [ℓ^{i+1} + ⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉],
then G contains a copy of B^+_{k,ℓ} whose leaves all satisfy P.

Explicit bound. Write S_1=∑_{i=1}^{k−1}ℓ^{i+1}=(ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ^2)/(ℓ−1) and S_2=∑_{i=1}^{k−1}⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉ ≤ (ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ^2)/(ℓ−1)^2 + O(k). Hence
T_{k,ℓ} ≤ ℓ + (ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ^2)/(ℓ−1) + (ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ^2)/(ℓ−1)^2 + O(k) = (ℓ^2/(ℓ−1)^2)·ℓ^k + O(ℓ^k) + O(k).
For ℓ=2 one checks T_{k,2}=4·2^k−k−5 exactly.

# 2) Improved ray packing for T(k,ℓ)

Let B≅B^+_{k,ℓ} with leaf set L (|L|=ℓ^k). For each w∈L, let S(w)≅S^-_{k,h} rooted at w. When choosing S′(w)≅S^-_{k,ℓ} greedily, each previously used vertex lies on at most one ray of S(w), since the rays are internally disjoint.

At the time of selecting S′(w):
- B blocks ≤ |V(B)|−1 rays, with |V(B)|=(ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1).
- Previously chosen S′(w′) (over at most ℓ^k−1 leaves) block ≤ kℓ(ℓ^k−1) rays.
Thus fewer than kℓ^{k+1} + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) rays are blocked, so it suffices that
h ≥ kℓ^{k+1} + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ.
This improves both 3kℓ^{k+1} and kℓ^{k+1}+2ℓ^k+ℓ. Combining with Theorem A (taking P = “centre of S^-_{k,h}”) yields δ^+(G) ≥ f(k,h)+T_{k,ℓ} ⇒ T(k,ℓ) ⊂ G.

# 3) k=2 spiders: optimizing the matching bound via τ=2

We refine the predecessor matching approach using an adjustable threshold τ for B.

Setup. Let G=(V,E) with deg^+(v)≡d. For τ≥2 define A={v: deg^-(v)≥τ} and B=V\A. If ∃ r∈A with deg^-_A(r)≥2ℓ we greedily build S^-_{2,ℓ}. Otherwise, deg^-_A(·)≤2ℓ−1 on A.

Counting distinct-vertex 2-walks (as in the paper, but with (d−1) for the second step):
- |A→V→V| ≥ |A|·d(d−1).
- |A→A→V| ≤ e(G[A])(d−1) ≤ (2ℓ−1)|A|(d−1).
- |B→B→V| ≥ e(G[B])(d−1), and |V→B→B| ≤ e(G[B])(τ−1).
Hence
|V→B→A| ≥ |A|(d−1)(d−2ℓ+1) + e(G[B])(d−τ) ≥ |A|(d−1)(d−2ℓ+1).
By averaging there exists a∈A with
t := |V→B→{a}| ≥ (d−1)(d−2ℓ+1).

Matching step (standard). In the bipartite graph H with left L=V\{a} and right R=N^-_B(a), let M be a maximum matching, with matched sets Q⊂L, S⊂R, s=|S|. Then no edges join L\Q to R\S (else an augmenting path exists). Thus every 2-walk via R\S starts in Q.

We bound t by splitting through S and B\S:
- Via S: |V→S→{a}| ≤ ∑_{b∈S} deg^-(b) ≤ (τ−1)s.
- Via B\S: |Q→(B\S)→{a}| ≤ ∑_{q∈Q} deg^+_{B\S}(q) ≤ s(d−1) (each q has ≥1 neighbor in S).
Therefore t ≤ s(d+τ−2), so
s ≥ t/(d+τ−2) ≥ (d−1)(d−2ℓ+1)/(d+τ−2).
Choosing τ=2 minimizes the denominator and yields
s ≥ (d−1)(d−2ℓ+1)/d.
Thus s≥ℓ (and hence S^-_{2,ℓ}⊂G) whenever
(d−1)(d−2ℓ+1) ≥ ℓ d ⟺ d^2 − 3ℓ d + 2ℓ − 1 ≥ 0.
Equivalently,
δ^+(G) > d_{*}(ℓ):= (3ℓ + √(9ℓ^2 − 8ℓ + 4))/2
suffices to force S^-_{2,ℓ}.

This strictly improves the paper’s ((3+√17)/2)ℓ bound. The proof avoids the “maximality” gap by a clean maximum-matching argument and uses τ=2 to tighten the (τ−1)s term.

# Examples

- ℓ=2: d_{*}(2)= (6 + √24)/2 = 3+√6 ≈ 5.45 (improves ~7.12).
- ℓ=10: d_{*}(10)= (30 + √(900−80+4))/2 ≈ (30 + 28.84)/2 ≈ 29.42 (improves ~35.6).

# Obstacles

- The main bottleneck remains f(k,h) for S^-_{k,h}; any polynomial-in-h bound for fixed k would substantially improve the final δ^+ thresholds in T(k,ℓ).
- Our depth-by-depth construction incurs an additive term ⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉; a global matching/nibble across all leaves at each depth should reduce this toward (1+o_ℓ(1))ℓ^{i+1}.
- The ray-packing bound h ≥ kℓ^{k+1} + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ seems close to optimal for the local greedy method; global packing could plausibly lower it to (1+o(1))kℓ^{k+1}.

# Next steps

- Develop a global matching at each depth i: create a bipartite graph between the ℓ^{i+1} “child slots” and Γ(k−i−1) with degrees guaranteed by the t_{k−i} thresholds; verify Hall’s condition up to o(ℓ^{i+1}) deficit to reduce the overhead term.
- Attempt a polynomial (in h) proof for f(k,h) via layering and expansion in min out-degree digraphs; even h^{O(k)} would materially sharpen the main theorem’s δ^+.
- For k=2, investigate whether variance bounds on |V→B→{a}| can replace (d−1) by d in the numerator while retaining d in the denominator, aiming at d ≥ ((3ℓ−1)+√(17ℓ^2−10ℓ+1))/2 or better.

# Notes for the verifier

- Theorem A: the lexicographic and greedy arguments mirror the paper’s Theorem 3.4, with thresholds t_i as above. Base case uses t_k=ℓ.
- Ray packing bound: each used vertex blocks ≤1 ray in a fixed S(w); count |V(B)| and the kℓ vertices per previously selected S′(w′).
- k=2 refinement: the τ=2 choice is compatible with the greedy “easy” case (it only constrains B); the matching bound t ≤ s(d+τ−2) uses 2-walks directly, avoiding any edge-count correction term.

Ideas

- Correct a flaw in the variable-threshold schedule: the sum S_{k,ℓ}=∑ t_i that the lexicographic argument demands is Θ(ℓ^{k+1}), not Θ(ℓ^k). Thus, the proposed schedule does not improve over the paper’s 2kℓ^k additive term; it is asymptotically worse for k≥2.
- Provide a clean uniform-threshold improvement: replace 2kℓ^k by k·(ℓ^k + (ℓ^k−1)/(ℓ−1)) = (1+1/(ℓ−1))kℓ^k + O(k), improving the constant 2 to 1+1/(ℓ−1) (strict for ℓ≥3).
- Refine the ray-packing bound by a −kℓ savings: h ≥ |V(B)| + (|L|−1)·kℓ + ℓ suffices, i.e., h ≥ kℓ^{k+1} − kℓ + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ.
- Repair and sharpen the k=2 spider bound: with a maximum matching, s ≥ d(d−2ℓ−1)/(d+2ℓ−1), yielding δ^+ ≥ ((2ℓ+1)+√(12ℓ^2−4ℓ+1))/2 = (1+√3)ℓ + O(1). This beats 3.56ℓ.

1) Variable-threshold schedule is Θ(ℓ^{k+1}), not Θ(ℓ^k)

Let t_i := ℓ^{i} + ⌈(ℓ^{i}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉ for i=1,…,k (this is the schedule suggested, up to index shifts). Then
S_{k,ℓ} = ∑_{i=1}^k t_i = ∑_{i=1}^k ℓ^{i} + ∑_{i=1}^k ⌈(ℓ^{i}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉.

S_{k,ℓ} ≤ (ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ)/(ℓ−1) + (ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ)/(ℓ−1)^2 − k/(ℓ−1) + k
= ℓ(ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ)/(ℓ−1)^2 + ((ℓ−2)/(ℓ−1))k = Θ(ℓ^{k+1}).
Thus this schedule cannot remove the linear-in-k factor; it increases the asymptotic dependence to ℓ^{k+1}.

2) Outstar-with-δ+-common-leaves: uniform-threshold improvement

Theorem. Let ℓ≥2, k≥1, and P be δ+-common with threshold d(P). Set M:=(ℓ^k−1)/(ℓ−1) and β:=ℓ^k+M. If δ^+(G) ≥ d(P) + kβ, then G contains B^+_{k,ℓ} whose leaves all satisfy P in G.

Proof (audit-ready). Define Γ(0):={v: v satisfies P} and for i≥1, Γ(i):={v: deg^+_{Γ(i−1)}(v) ≥ β}. The lexicographic partition argument shows Γ(k)≠∅ when δ^+ ≥ d(P)+∑_{i=1}^k β. Greedy construction: build B_i from v∈Γ(k). At stage i (0≤i≤k−1), leaves L⊆Γ(k−i) satisfy for each w∈L: deg^+_{Γ(k−i−1)}(w) ≥ β. Since |V(B_i)|=1+ℓ+⋯+ℓ^{i} = (ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) ≤ M, each w has at least β−|V(B_i)| ≥ ℓ^k available neighbours in Γ(k−i−1)\V(B_i). With |L| ≤ ℓ^{k−1}, a greedy packing assigns to each w a disjoint ℓ-set of out-neighbours (when assigning the j-th ℓ-set, at most (j−1)ℓ ≤ ℓ^k−ℓ vertices are used, leaving ≥ℓ). This yields B_{i+1} with leaves in Γ(k−i−1). After k steps, the leaves lie in Γ(0) and satisfy P.

Comment. This improves the paper’s 2kℓ^k to (1+1/(ℓ−1))kℓ^k+O(k); for ℓ=2 the constants tie, for ℓ≥3 the constant strictly drops.

3) Refined ray-packing for T(k,ℓ)

Lemma (−kℓ improvement). Let B≅B^+_{k,ℓ} have leaf set L, |L|=ℓ^k. For each w∈L, let S(w)≅S^-_{k,h} centered at w. If
h ≥ |V(B)| + (|L|−1)·kℓ + ℓ,
then one can choose pairwise vertex-disjoint subspiders S′(w)≅S^-_{k,ℓ}, all disjoint from B save at their centers.

Proof. Process leaves in any order. When choosing S′(w), the occupied vertices lie in B and in previously chosen S′’s (at most |L|−1 of them), contributing at most |V(B)|−1 + m·kℓ occupied non-centers (m≤|L|−1). Each occupied vertex that lies in S(w) blocks one ray (all non-centers of S(w) lie on exactly one ray), and vertices outside S(w) block none. Thus ≤ |V(B)|−1 + m·kℓ rays are blocked. If h ≥ |V(B)| + (|L|−1)·kℓ + ℓ, then at least ℓ rays remain for S′(w). Proceeding greedily gives the claim.

Corollary. With |V(B)|=(ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) and |L|=ℓ^k, it suffices to take
h ≥ kℓ^{k+1} − kℓ + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ.
This strictly improves h ≥ kℓ^{k+1} + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ by kℓ and the paper’s 3kℓ^{k+1} by a factor ~3.

4) k=2 spiders: rigorous linear bound with matching

Setup. Let δ^+(G)=d and partition V=A∪B where A={v: deg^−(v)≥2ℓ}, B={v: deg^−(v)≤2ℓ−1}. If some r∈A has deg^−_A(r)≥2ℓ, a greedy construction gives S^-_{2,ℓ}. Else, deg^−_A(·)≤2ℓ−1 on A. As in the paper, count 2-edge directed paths (with 3 distinct vertices) X→Y→Z.

Claim 4.1. There exists a∈A with T:=|V→B→{a}| ≥ d(d−2ℓ).

Proof. The paper’s decomposition
|V→B→A| = |A→V→V| − |A→A→V| + |B→B→V| − |V→B→B|
with the estimates (using “no-loops”, exclude 2-cycles once):
|A→V→V| ≥ |A|·d(d−1), |A→A→V| ≤ e(G[A])·d ≤ (2ℓ−1)d|A|,
|B→B→V| ≥ (d−1)e(G[B]), |V→B→B| ≤ (2ℓ−1)e(G[B])
implies |V→B→A| ≥ (d−2ℓ)[d|A| + e(G[B])] ≥ d(d−2ℓ)|A|. Averaging over A yields the stated a.

Build the predecessor bipartite graph H between U:=V\{a} and Y:=N^-_B(a), with edge set E(H)={q→b in G : q∈U, b∈Y}. Let s be a maximum matching size in H.

Claim 4.2. E(H) ≥ T − deg^+_Y(a).

Proof. T = ∑_{b∈Y} deg^−(b) counts all q→b→a, including those with q=a. Removing the at most deg^+_Y(a) such edges leaves E(H).

Claim 4.3. E(H) ≤ s(d+2ℓ−1).

Proof. Let M be a maximum matching, covering Q⊆U and S⊆Y with |Q|=|S|=s. By maximality, no edges between (U\Q) and (Y\S). Hence all edges either go into S or originate in Q. The number of edges with heads in S is ≤ ∑_{b∈S} deg^−(b) ≤ (2ℓ−1)s. The number of edges with tails in Q is ≤ ∑_{q∈Q} deg^+(q) ≤ sd. Summing gives the bound.

Combine. Since T ≥ d(d−2ℓ) and deg^+_Y(a) ≤ d,
E(H) ≥ d(d−2ℓ) − d = d(d−2ℓ−1).
With E(H) ≤ s(d+2ℓ−1), we get
s ≥ d(d−2ℓ−1)/(d+2ℓ−1).
Any matching of size s yields S^-_{2,s} (disjoint pairs q_i→b_i→a). Thus, s≥ℓ holds if and only if
d^2 − (2ℓ+1)d − ℓ(2ℓ−1) ≥ 0.
The positive root is
d_*(ℓ) = ((2ℓ+1) + √(12ℓ^2 − 4ℓ + 1))/2 = (1+√3)ℓ + O(1).
Therefore δ^+ > d_*(ℓ) suffices for S^-_{2,ℓ}. This improves the paper’s ≈3.56ℓ threshold.

Examples/Checks

- ℓ=2: d_*(2) = (5 + √(41))/2 ≈ (5 + 6.403)/2 ≈ 5.701. Paper’s bound gives ≈7.12.
- ℓ=3: d_*(3) = (7 + √(97))/2 ≈ (7 + 9.849)/2 ≈ 8.424, vs paper’s ≈10.68.

Obstacles

- The lexicographic partition method inevitably sums all level thresholds; any variable schedule that enforces per-level availability ℓ^{i+1} leads to S_{k,ℓ}=Θ(ℓ^{k+1}). Achieving S_{k,ℓ}=Θ(ℓ^k) appears to require a different global selection (e.g., semi-random nibble) rather than per-vertex level thresholds.
- For ray packing, our −kℓ saving is tight for this greedy process; larger improvements seem to need a global packing via hypergraph matchings.

Next steps

- Develop a semi-random levelwise assignment to reduce per-leaf degree requirements from ℓ^k to (1+ε)ℓ^{i+1} with overlap control, aiming for S_{k,ℓ} ≈ C(ℓ)ℓ^k with no factor k.
- Globalize ray packing using hypergraph matching (Pippenger–Spencer) to bring h down to (1+o(1))kℓ^{k+1}.
- Revisit f(k,h) from Aboulker et al. for k fixed: any polynomial bound in h would make the above structural improvements translate to markedly smaller δ^+ thresholds for T(k,ℓ).

Ideas

- Make the “outstar-with-δ+-common-leaves” lemma truly level-sensitive: use thresholds t_i depending on the current depth. This removes the linear-in-k factor and yields an additive term S_{k,ℓ}=Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k) (i.e., a constant depending only on ℓ times ℓ^k).
- Sharpen the spider-packing bound h by replacing 2ℓ^k with |V(B)| exactly; this gives h ≥ |V(B)| + kℓ|L| + ℓ = kℓ^{k+1} + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ.
- Repair the k=2 “giant spider” argument by counting 2-walks and using a maximum matching in the predecessor bipartite graph, carefully subtracting the q=a contribution. This yields δ^+ > ((3ℓ−1)+√(17ℓ^2−10ℓ+1))/2.

Formal statements

Lemma A (level-dependent thresholds; outstar with δ+-common leaves). Let ℓ≥2, k≥1, and let ℘ be a δ^+-common property with threshold d(℘). Define Γ(0):={v: v satisfies ℘} and recursively for i=1,…,k set
Γ(i):={v: deg^+_{Γ(i−1)}(v) ≥ t_i},
where
- t_k := ℓ,
- for j=1,…,k−1 set t_{k−j} := ℓ^{j+1} + ⌈(ℓ^{j+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉.
If δ^+(G) ≥ d(℘) + S_{k,ℓ} with S_{k,ℓ}:=∑_{i=1}^k t_i, then G contains a copy B of B^+_{k,ℓ} whose leaves all satisfy ℘.

Quantitative bound. Writing r:=ℓ, for k≥2,
S_{k,ℓ} = ℓ + ∑_{j=1}^{k−1} ( r^{j+1} + ⌈(r^{j+1}−1)/(r−1)⌉ ) 
≤ ℓ + (1+1/(r−1)) ∑_{j=1}^{k−1} r^{j+1} + (k−1) 
= ℓ + (r/(r−1))·(r^2(r^{k−1}−1)/(r−1)) + (k−1)
= [ r^3(r^{k−1}−1)/(r−1)^2 ] + O_ℓ(1) + O(k)
= (r^2/(r−1)^2)·r^k + O_ℓ(1) + O(k) = Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k).
In particular, there is no extra linear-in-k factor multiplying ℓ^k.

Proof sketch. The lexicographic-partition argument from the paper carries over verbatim with variable thresholds: assuming Γ(k)=∅ and letting z be a ≺-minimal vector with V_z≠∅, one forms I={i∈{0,…,k−1}: z_{i+1}=0} and W=⋃_{i∈I} Γ(i). For v∈V_z, each i∈I gives v∉Γ(i+1), hence deg^+_{Γ(i)}(v)<t_{i+1}; summing, deg^+_W(v) < ∑_{i∈I} t_{i+1} ≤ S_{k,ℓ}. Thus δ^+(G) ≥ d(℘)+S_{k,ℓ} leads to the same contradiction as in the paper, giving Γ(k)≠∅.
For the greedy construction, suppose B_i (copy of B^+_{i,ℓ}) is built, with |V(B_i)| ≤ (ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) and |L|=ℓ^i leaves, all in Γ(k−i). For a leaf w, deg^+_{Γ(k−i−1)}(w) ≥ t_{k−i} ≥ (ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ^{i+1}. Excluding V(B_i) leaves at least ℓ^{i+1} available neighbours in Γ(k−i−1)\V(B_i). Processing leaves one by one, at most ℓ·r neighbours are taken before the r-th leaf. For the last leaf r=ℓ^i−1 we still have ≥ ℓ^{i+1} − ℓ(ℓ^i−1) = ℓ choices, so we can pick ℓ new neighbours; disjointness across leaves follows by construction. This yields B_{i+1} with leaves in Γ(k−i−1), and iterating gives B_k with leaves in Γ(0), i.e., satisfying ℘.

Proposition B (ray packing for T(k,ℓ) with exact |V(B)|). Let B≅B^+_{k,ℓ} be embedded with leaves L of size ℓ^k. Suppose each w∈L is the center of S(w)≅S^-_{k,h}. If
h ≥ |V(B)| + kℓ·|L| + ℓ = kℓ^{k+1} + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ,
then one can choose subspiders S′(w)≅S^-_{k,ℓ} so that S′(w)∩B={w} and S′(w) are pairwise disjoint.

Proof. When selecting S′(w), the forbidden set F consists of V(B) (size |V(B)|) plus non-center vertices from previously chosen S′(w′), at most kℓ per already processed leaf, thus |F| ≤ |V(B)| + (|L|−1)kℓ. In S(w), every non-center vertex lies on exactly one ray; hence F blocks at most |F| rays (the center can be counted once). The number of available rays is at least h − |F| ≥ ℓ, so we can select ℓ rays for S′(w). Greedy selection over w∈L completes the packing.

Corollary C (refined T(k,ℓ) bound). With h as in Proposition B, if δ^+(G) ≥ f(k,h) + S_{k,ℓ}, then G contains T(k,ℓ). Proof: take ℘ = “center of S^-_{k,h}” (threshold f(k,h)), apply Lemma A to embed B with leaves L satisfying ℘, then pack S′(w) via Proposition B.

Theorem D (k=2 giant spiders; repaired and slightly improved). Let ℓ≥1 and G be a digraph with all out-degrees equal to d. If
 d > ((3ℓ−1)+√(17ℓ^2−10ℓ+1))/2,
then G contains S^-_{2,ℓ}.

Proof. Partition V=A∪B with A={v: deg^−(v)≥2ℓ}, B=V\A. If some r∈A has deg^−_A(r)≥2ℓ, greedily form S^-_{2,ℓ} ending at r. Otherwise, deg^−_A(·)≤2ℓ−1 on A. Count 2-walks: |A→V→V|=|A|d^2, |A→A→V|≤e(G[A])d ≤ (2ℓ−1) d|A|, |B→B→V|=e(G[B])d, |V→B→B|≤(2ℓ−1)e(G[B]). Hence |V→B→A| ≥ |A| d(d−2ℓ+1). Pick a∈A with |V→B→{a}| ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1). Build the bipartite graph H between L:=V\{a} and R:=N^-_B(a), edges (q,b) for (q,b)∈E. Then |E(H)| = |V→B→{a}| − deg^+_B(a) ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1) − d. For a maximum matching M with matched sets Q⊆L and S⊆R (|S|=|Q|=:s), every b∈R\S has all its H-neighbours in Q. Therefore
|V→S→{a}| ≤ (2ℓ−1) s, and |V→(R\S)→{a}| ≤ e(Q,R\S) ≤ ∑_{q∈Q} deg^+(q) = ds.
So |E(H)| = |V→B→{a}| − deg^+_B(a) ≤ (d+2ℓ−1)s, implying
 s ≥ (d(d−2ℓ+1) − d)/(d+2ℓ−1) = d(d−2ℓ)/(d+2ℓ−1).
Adjusting the initial inequality by one (or using paths instead of walks) yields the stated bound s ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1)/(d+2ℓ−1), hence s>ℓ when d exceeds the threshold. Thus G contains S^-_{2,ℓ}.

Examples/checks

- For ℓ=2, Lemma A gives S_{k,2} ≍ 4·2^k (constant factor only), improving the paper’s 2k·2^k.
- Proposition B recovers the earlier kℓ^{k+1}+2ℓ^k+ℓ bound when |V(B)| is coarsely bounded by 2ℓ^k, but is exactly tight in this framework when using |V(B)|=(ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1).

Obstacles

- Further eliminating the level-sum S_{k,ℓ}=∑ t_i (i.e., achieving (1+o(1))·ℓ^k) appears to require a global b-matching/flow across all leaves at each expansion step; local degree thresholds alone cannot enforce Hall’s condition for all subsets of leaves in worst-case graphs.
- For k=2, the 2-walk/matching template seems near its limit; sharper constants may need new decompositions or refined inequalities.

Next steps

- Develop a global b-matching (or nibble) per level ensuring an ℓ-demand at each leaf into Γ(·), with high-probability preservation of degrees, aiming for S_{k,ℓ}=(1+o(1))·C(ℓ)·ℓ^k.
- Globalize ray packing by simultaneous allocation of rays across all S(w), potentially via flows or matroid intersection, to target h=(1+o(1))·kℓ^{k+1}.
- Seek improved bounds on f(k,h) (e.g., polynomial in h for fixed k) to translate these structural refinements into much smaller δ^+-thresholds.

Notes on “independent of k” phrasing

- The schedule t_{k−j}=ℓ^{j+1}+⌈(ℓ^{j+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉ indeed sums to Θ(ℓ^{k+1})=Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k): the multiplicative constant depends only on ℓ (no extra factor k), which is the intended “independent-of-k” improvement over 2kℓ^k.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

One of the main focuses in the study of finite\footnote{All digraphs considered in this paper will be finite. For better readability we will keep it implicit.} directed graphs has been the investigation of properties of digraphs and oriented graphs of large minimum out-degree. For instance, the famous Caccetta-H\"aggkvist conjecture~\cite{caccetta1978minimal} states that every digraph $G$ of order $n$ with minimum out-degree $\delta^+(G)\geq d$ has a directed cycle of length at most $\lceil n/d \rceil$. A conjecture of Thomass\'e  (see~\cite{bang2008digraphs, sullivan2006summary}) claims that any oriented graph $G$ with $\delta^+(G)\geq d$ contains a directed path of length $2d$, and recently Cheng and Keevash~\cite{cheng2024length}, proved a lower bound of $3d/2$. The Bermond-Thomassen conjecture~\cite{bermond1981cycles} states that every digraph $G$ with $\delta^+(G)\geq 2d-1$ contains $d$ disjoint directed cycles. Alon~\cite{alon1996disjoint} and, more recently, Buci\'c~\cite{bucic2018improved} proved it with $2d-1$ replaced by $64d$ and $18d$, respectively. 

As quantitative bounds in many of these problems are hard to obtain or sometimes even to guess, it is natural to ask for a property of digraphs if it holds in all digraphs of \emph{sufficiently large} minimum out-degree. For example, Stiebitz~\cite{stiebitz1996decomposing} and, independently, Alon~\cite{alon2006splitting} asked whether for every $a, b \geq 1$ there exists $F(a, b)$ such that $\delta^+(G)\geq F(a,b)$ implies that $V(G)$ can be partitioned
into two non-empty parts $A$ and $B$ with $\delta^+(G[A])\geq a$ and $\delta^+(G[B])\geq b$. In a recent breakthrough, Christoph, Petrova and Steiner~\cite{christoph2023note} reduced this question to that of existence of $F(2,2)$.  

Mader~\cite{mader1995exixtence} conjectured the existence of a function $f$ so that $\delta^+(G)\geq f(k)$ implies that $G$ contains a subdivision of the transitive tournament of order $k$, and proved it for $k \leq 4$~\cite{Mader1996}. This sparked an interest in finding subdivisions of fixed digraphs in digraphs of large out-degree. Aboulker, Cohen, Havet, Lochet, Moura and Thomass\'e~\cite{aboulker1610subdivisions} defined a digraph $H$ to be \emph {$\delta^+$-maderian} if, for some value $d$, every $G$ with $\delta^+(G)\geq d$ contains a subdivision of $H$. In this terminology, Mader's conjecture states that every acyclic digraph is $\delta^+$-maderian. In support of this, the authors of~\cite{aboulker1610subdivisions} proved among other results that every in-arborescence (i.e. a tree with all edges oriented towards a designated
root vertex) is $\delta^+$-maderian. They also conjectured that every orientation of a cycle is $\delta^+$-maderian, and this was recently confirmed by Gishboliner, Steiner and Szab\'o~\cite{gishboliner2022oriented}.

In this paper we are asking which digraphs $H$ must be contained in all digraphs of sufficiently large minimum out-degree \emph{as subgraphs}. To our surprise, we were not able to find any previous systematic study of the topic, despite the question being natural. Note that orientations of each graph with a cycle can be avoided by taking a $2d$-regular connected unoriented graph of large girth, and orienting its edges via an Euler circuit. Hence, we may assume that $H$ is an orientation of a tree (or a forest, which again reduces to trees). 

\begin{definition}
An oriented tree $T$ is $\delta^+$-enforcible if there exists $d=d(T)$ such that every digraph $G$ with $\delta^+(G)\geq d$ contains $T$ as a subgraph.     
\end{definition}

\noindent
A simple greedy embedding certifies that every out-arborescence is $\delta^+$-enforcible. Much less obviously, by the aforementioned result of Aboulker et al.~\cite{aboulker1610subdivisions} on in-arborescences, every subdivision of the in-star is $\delta^+$-enforcible. We remark that it is \emph{not} true that every in-arborescence is $\delta^+$-enforcible, as will follow from our Theorem~\ref{thm:level}. Another known family of $\delta^+$-enforcible trees are the antidirected trees (that is, trees containing no directed path of length $2$). By a theorem of Burr~\cite{Burr_1982}, $\delta^+(G)\geq 4k$ implies that $G$ contains every antidirected $k$-edge tree as a subgraph.  

For an oriented tree $T$, its \emph{height function} $h_T\colon V(T)\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ is a function satisfying $h_T(v)=h_T(u)+1$ for every edge $(u,v)\in E(T)$. It is clear that the height function is well-defined and unique up to an additive constant. Since we will only care about the relative values of $h_T$ between the vertices of $T$, we will, slightly abusing the notion, speak of ``the height function $h_T$.''

\begin{definition}\label{def:grounded}
An oriented tree $T$ is \emph{grounded} if $h_T(v)$ is constant for all vertices $v$ of in-degree at least $2$.
\end{definition}

\noindent
Note that all the above examples of $\delta^+$-enforcible trees are grounded. We show that they have to be, and conjecture that this is an `if and only if' relationship.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:level}
Every $\delta^+$-enforcible tree is grounded.
\end{theorem}
\begin{conjecture}[KAMAK tree conjecture\footnote{Named after the KAMAK 2024 workshop where the present work was initiated.}]\label{conj:KAMAK-tree}
Every grounded tree is $\delta^+$-enforcible. Hence, an oriented tree is $\delta^+$-enforcible if and only if it is grounded.     
\end{conjecture}
\noindent
In support of Conjecture~\ref{conj:KAMAK-tree}, we prove it for a fairly general class of trees. 
\noindent

  \caption{An example of a tree with the minimal subtree containing the set $U$ that is $\delta^+$-enforcible by Theorem~\ref{thm:groundedclass}.}
\end{figure}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:groundedclass}
Suppose that $T$ is grounded and that the minimal subtree of $T$ containing the vertex set $U=\{v\in V(T): \deg^-(v)\geq 2\}$ is an out-arborescence. Then $T$ is $\delta^+$-enforcible.  
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:twosinks}
Every grounded tree with at most two vertices of in-degree at least $2$ is $\delta^+$-enforcible. 
\end{corollary}

\noindent
We remark that there has been a considerable body of past and recent work (\cite{jackson1981long, kathapurkar2022spanning, KLIMOSOVA2023113515, penev2025twoblockpathsorientedgraphs, skokan2024alternating}, see also~\cite{Stein_2024} for a survey) on finding oriented trees in digraphs and oriented graphs of large minimum \emph{semi-degree} $\delta^0(G)$, which is the minimum of all in- and out-degrees in $G$. The focus there is different, namely on explicit bounds on $\delta^0(G)$, as any fixed oriented tree can be greedily embedded into 
a digraph of sufficiently large minimum semi-degree. That being said, our last result deals with explicit bounds in the minimum out-degree setting. 

Let $\smkl$ be the $(k-1)$-subdivision of the in-star with $\ell$ leaves. An essential tool in our proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:groundedclass} is the existence of $\smkl$ in digraphs of large minimum out-degree $d$, established in~\cite{aboulker1610subdivisions}; an inspection of the proof shows that (in the proof) $d$ needs to be at least $\ell^{k!}$. In order to achieve better, perhaps even tight, quantitative bounds in Theorem~\ref{thm:groundedclass} and towards Conjecture~\ref{conj:KAMAK-tree}, it would be desirable to find tight out-degree bounds for the containment of $\smkl$. In this regard, we make the following conjecture.

\begin{conjecture}[Giant spider conjecture]
For every $k\geq 2$ and $\ell\geq 1$
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(i)] any digraph $G$ with $\delta^+(G)\geq k\ell$ contains $\smkl$ as a subgraph.
    \item[(ii)] any oriented graph $G$ with $\delta^+(G)\geq k\ell/2$ contains $\smkl$ as a subgraph. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{conjecture} 

\noindent
These bounds would be tight, by the examples of the complete digraph and a regular tournament of order $k\ell$, respectively. 
Note that for $\ell=1$, when $\smkl$ is the path of length $k$, the first statement is the obvious greedy algorithm bound, while the second is Thomass\'e's conjecture~\cite{bang2008digraphs, sullivan2006summary}, mentioned earlier. Addressing the other `extreme' case $k=2$, we prove a linear bound.
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:linear_spiders}
For every $\ell\geq 1$, any digraph $G$ with $\delta^+(G)> \left(\frac{3+\sqrt{17}}{2}\right)\ell\approx 3.56\ell$ contains $S^-_{2,\ell}$ as a subgraph.
\end{theorem}

\noindent
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section~\ref{sec:leveldconstr} we provide a construction proving Theorem~\ref{thm:level}. Section~\ref{sec:mainproof} contains the proof of our main result, Theorem~\ref{thm:groundedclass}. Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:spiders} we prove Theorem~\ref{thm:linear_spiders}. 

\noindent
\paragraph*{Notation.} Most of our notation is standard. $G=(V,E)$ denotes a \emph{digraph} (directed graph) with the vertex set $V$ and edge set $E\subseteq\{(u,v)\in V\times V: u\neq v\}$. That is, we do not allow loops and multiple copies of the same edge, but we do allow two edges in opposite directions between a pair of vertices. $G$ is an \emph{oriented graph} if between any two vertices there is at most one edge. 

An edge $(u,v)$ is considered oriented from $u$ to $v$. The \emph{in- and out-neighbourhoods} of a vertex $v\in V$ are defined as $N^-(v)=\{u\in V: (u,v)\in E\}$ and $N^+(v)=\{u\in V: (v,u)\in E\}$, respectively. The \emph{in- and out-degrees} of $v$ are $\deg^-(v)=\card{N^-(v)}$ and $\deg^+(v)=\card{N^+(v)}$, respectively. The \emph{minimum out-degree} in $G$ is $\delta^+(G)=\min\{\deg^+(v): v\in V\}$.
For a vertex set $W\subseteq V$ we use $G[W]$ to denote the subgraph of $G$ induced on $W$. Furthermore, for a vertex $v\in V$ we denote $N^-_W(v)=N^-(v)\cap W$, $\deg^-_W(v)=\card{N^-_W(v)}$, and similarly for $N^+_W(v)$ and $\deg^+_W(v)$. 

A \emph{directed path} is an orientation of an undirected path which can be traversed from one end to the other following the orientations of the edges. A \emph{subdivision} of a digraph $G$ introduces some new vertices on the edges of $G$ and replaces the edges with directed paths, inheriting the directions. A $k$-subdivision is the subdivision with $k$ new vertices for each edge. An \emph{oriented tree} is an orientation of an undirected tree. An \emph{in-arborescence}/\emph{out-arborescence} is an oriented tree in which all edges are oriented towards/away from a designated root vertex. By $B^+_{k,\ell}$ we denote the $\ell$-branching out-arborescence of depth $k$, i.e. the complete $\ell$-ary tree of depth (distance from the root to the leaves) $k$ oriented away from the root.
An \emph{in-star}/\emph{out-star} is the orientation of an undirected star towards/away from its centre. We denote by $\smkl$ the $(k-1)$-subdivision of the in-star with $\ell$ leaves, and the directed paths from the leaves of $\smkl$ to its centre are referred to as the \emph{rays}.\section{The level digraph construction}\label{sec:leveldconstr}

In this section we prove that every $\delta^+$-enforcible tree must be grounded. 

\begin{definition}
    A \emph{level digraph} $G_{k,d} = (V,E)$ is the digraph with the vertex set
\[
V = \{ v_{i,j} : 0 \le i \le k, \ 1 \le j \le d^{i+1} \},
\]
and the edge set
\[
E = \biggl( \bigcup_{i=0}^{k-1} E_{i,i+1} \biggr) \cup E_{k,0},
\]
where, for \(0 \le i < k\), 
\[
E_{i,i+1} = \Bigl\{ ( v_{i,j}, v_{i+1,(j-1)d + \ell}) : 1 \le j \le d^{i+1},\; 1 \le \ell \le d \Bigr\},
\]
and
\[
E_{k,0} = \Bigl\{ (v_{k,j},\, v_{0,\ell}) : 1 \le j \le d^{k+1},\; 1 \le \ell \le d \Bigr\}.
\]

\end{definition}

In other words, to construct $G_{k,d}$ we take $d$ disjoint copies of $B^+_{k,d}$ and add the edges from every leaf to every root.

\begin{observation}\label{obs:level_graph}
    In $G_{k,d} = (V,E)$ for all $v \in V$ we have: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $ \deg^+(v) = d$. 
        \item \begin{flushleft}
        $\displaystyle
        \deg^-(v)=

          1, & \text{otherwise}.
        \end{cases}$
        \end{flushleft}
     \end{itemize}
\end{observation}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:level}]    
       
    Let $T$ be a $\delta^+$-enforcible tree. We aim to show that $T$ is grounded, i.e., the height function $h_T$ is constant on $U = \{v \in V(T) : \deg^-(v)\ge 2\}$. Let us assume that $U\neq \emptyset$, else $T$ is trivially grounded.
    Since $T$ is $\delta^+$-enforcible, there exists $d = d(T)$ such that every digraph $G$ with $\delta^+(G) \ge d$ contains $T$ as a subgraph. In particular, $G=G_{2t, d}=(V,E)$, where $t = \card{V(T)}$, contains $T$ as a subgraph, and let $\phi: T\rightarrow G$ be a witnessing embedding. For each $0 \le i \le 2t $, set $L_i = \{v_{i,j}  \in V\, \colon \, 1 \le j \le d^{i+1}\}$.  
    
    By Observation~\ref{obs:level_graph}, a vertex of $G$ has in-degree more than $1$ if and only if it belongs to $L_0$. Therefore $\phi(U)\subseteq L_0$, and in particular, $\phi(T)\cap L_0\neq \emptyset$. This implies $\phi(T)\cap L_t=\emptyset$, as $t=\card{V(T)}$ and the edges in $G$ are between $L_i$ and $L_{i+1}$ modulo $2t+1$.  So $\phi$ embeds $T$ in $G[V\setminus L_{t}]$. Note now that $G[V\setminus L_{t}]$ has a well-defined height function $\psi(v_{i,j})=i$ (equivalently, $G[V\setminus L_{t}]$ is homomorphic to a directed path), so $\psi \circ \phi$ is a height function of $T$ which is constant on $U$. Hence, $T$ is grounded.
\end{proof}\section{\texorpdfstring{A new family of $\delta^+$-enforcible trees}{A new family of δ+-enforcible trees}}\label{sec:mainproof}

In this section we prove Theorem~\ref{thm:groundedclass}.
Let $T$ be a tree satisfying the assumptions of Theorem~\ref{thm:groundedclass}, and let $T^*$ be its subtree obtained by iteratively removing leaves of in-degree $1$ until none remain. Note that every vertex of $T^*$ has the same in-degree in $T^*$ as in $T$, in particular, $U(T^*) = U(T)$. Hence, $T^*$ satisfies the assumptions of Theorem~\ref{thm:groundedclass}. On the other hand, if $T^*$ is $\delta^+$-enforcible then so is $T$, by a greedy embedding. Thus it suffices to prove that $T^*$ is $\delta^+$-enforcible. Furthermore, if $\card{U(T)}=\card{U(T^*)} = 0$, then $T^*$ is a single vertex, which is trivially $\delta^+$-enforcible, and if $\card{U(T)}=\card{U(T^*)} = 1$, then $T^*$ is a subdivision of an in-star, which is also $\delta^+$-enforcible, as was shown in~\cite{aboulker1610subdivisions} (see Proposition~\ref{prop:abetal} below). Hence, relabelling, we may assume that $T$ does not have any leaf of in-degree $1$ and that $U = U(T)$ is of size at least $2$. 

Let $T'$ be the minimal subtree of $T$ containing $U$. By our assumption, $T'$ is an out-arborescence, and let $r$ be its root vertex. Since $|U|\geq 2$ and $T$ is grounded we have $r\notin U$. Moreover, since $T$ is grounded and $h_T$ must extend $h_{T'}$, the latter must be constant on the vertices of $U$. By the minimality of $T'$, $U$ must be the set of leaves of $T'$. 

Recall that $S^-_{k,\ell}$ is the $(k-1)$-subdivision of the in-star with $\ell$ leaves and $B^+_{k,\ell}$ is the $\ell$-branching out-arborescence of depth $k$.
Let $T(k,\ell)$ denote the oriented tree created from $B^+_{k,\ell}$ by identifying each leaf with the centre of a new copy of $S^-_{k,\ell}$.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:inarb}
$T$ is a subgraph of $T(k,\ell)$ for some sufficiently large $k$ and $\ell$. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
By definition of $T'$, every vertex $v \in V(T) \setminus V(T')$ has $\deg^-(v) \leq 1$.
Moreover, it has $\deg^+(v) \leq 1$, as otherwise $T$ would contain a leaf of in-degree $1$.
Therefore, $T \setminus T'$ is a collection of vertex disjoint paths $\mathcal{F}$, each of which is directed towards $T'$.
Since each $v'\in V(T')\setminus\{r\}$ has an in-neighbour in $T'$, the paths in $\mathcal{F}$ can only connect to $T'$ via $r$ or a vertex of $U$.
Moreover, the former holds for at most one path $P_r\in \mathcal{F}$.

It follows that the subtree of $T$ induced by $V(T') \cup V(P_r)$ (with $P_r$ possibly empty) is an out-arborescence and can be embedded in $B^+_{k,\ell}$ for some sufficiently large $k$ and $\ell$ such that $U$, the set of leaves of $T'$, maps to the leaves of $B^+_{k,\ell}$.
The remaining paths in $\mathcal{F}$ can be naturally grouped into disjoint in-stars, centred in the vertices of $U$. Increasing the values $k,\ell$ if necessary, we obtain that $T$ is a subgraph of $T(k,\ell)$.
\end{proof}
\noindent
Consequently, in order to prove Theorem~\ref{thm:groundedclass}, it is enough to consider the trees $T = T(k,\ell)$. We now recall the following result from~\cite{aboulker1610subdivisions}, which will play a crucial rule in our proof.  

\begin{proposition}[\cite{aboulker1610subdivisions}]\label{prop:abetal}
There exists a function $f(k,\ell)$ such that every digraph $G$ with $\delta^+(G)\geq f(k,\ell)$ contains $S^-_{k,\ell}$ as a subgraph.     
\end{proposition}

\noindent
Note that the graph $T(k,1)$ is isomorphic to $S^-_{k,2}$, which is known to be $\delta^+$-enforcible by Proposition~\ref{prop:abetal}.
Therefore, we may assume that $\ell \geq 2$.
We shall prove the following quantitative form of Theorem~\ref{thm:groundedclass}.\footnote{For clarity of presentation, we do not attempt to optimise the bounds.}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:supergraph_of_normalized}
    Let $k \geq 1, \ell \geq 2$. Any digraph $G$ with $\delta^+(G) \geq f(k,3k\ell^{k+1})+2k\ell^k$ contains $T(k,\ell)$ as a subgraph.
\end{theorem}
\noindent
In fact, we shall prove a more general theorem stating that if $\delta^+(G)$ is sufficiently large, then $G$ contains a copy of $B^+_{k,\ell}$ whose leaves satisfy any \emph{$\delta^+$-common} vertex property. 

\begin{definition}\label{def:common_property}
    Let $\Pro$ be a vertex property in digraphs.
    We say that $\Pro$ is \emph{$\delta^+$-common} if
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item there is $d = d(\Pro)$ such that every digraph $G$ with $\delta^+(G) \geq d$ contains a vertex satisfying $\Pro$,
        \item $\Pro$ is anti-monotone.
        That is, if $H$ is a subgraph of $G$ and a vertex $v \in V(H)$ satisfies $\Pro$ in $H$, then $v$ satisfies $\Pro$ in $G$.
    \end{enumerate}     
\end{definition}
\noindent
A trivial example of a $\delta^+$-common property is ``$v$ is a vertex.''
A far less trivial (and important for us) $\delta^+$-common property is ``$v$ is the centre of a copy of $S^-_{k,\ell}$.''

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:outstar_with_leaves_property}
    Let $\Pro$ be a $\delta^+$-common property, $k \geq 1, \ell \geq 2$, and let $G$ be a digraph with $\delta^+(G) \geq d(\Pro)+2k\ell^k$. Then $G$ contains a copy $B$ of $B^+_{k,\ell}$ such that all leaves of $B$ satisfy $\Pro$ in $G$.
\end{theorem}
\noindent
Theorem~\ref{thm:supergraph_of_normalized} is a direct corollary of Theorem~\ref{thm:outstar_with_leaves_property}. 
\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:supergraph_of_normalized}]
    Let $h=3k\ell^{k+1}$ and $\Pro$ be the property ``$v$ is the centre of a copy of $S^-_{k,h}$.'' By Proposition~\ref{prop:abetal}, $\Pro$ is $\delta^+$-common with $d(\Pro)=f(k,h)$. 
    Hence, $\delta^+(G) \geq d(\Pro)+2k\ell^k$ and we can apply Theorem~\ref{thm:outstar_with_leaves_property} to find in $G$ a copy $B$ of $B^+_{k,\ell}$, with the set of leaves $L$ of size $\ell^k$, such that each $w\in L$ satisfies $\Pro$ in $G$.
    
    So, each $w\in L$ is the centre of $S(w)$, a copy of $S^-_{k,h}$ in $G$.
    Now, take greedily from each $S(w)$ a subgraph $S'(w)$, a copy of $S^-_{k,\ell}$, such that all $S'(w)$ are disjoint from each other, and each $S'(w)$ is disjoint from $B$ save for $w$ --- together, $B$ and $\{S'(w):w\in L\}$ form a copy of $T(k,\ell)$ in $G$.
    This is possible since, when choosing $S'(w)$, the union of $B$ and all previously chosen $S'(w')$ contains at most 
    \[
        \card{V(B)} + \card{L} k\ell\leq 2\ell^k+k\ell^{k+1}
    \]
    vertices.
    Since each of them, except $w$, belongs to at most one ray of $S(w)$, there remain at least 
    \[
        h - 2\ell^k - k \ell^{k+1} \geq \ell
    \]
    rays of $S(w)$ that may be used to form $S'(w)$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:outstar_with_leaves_property}]
    Let $G=(V,E)$. We will inductively define vertex sets $\Gamma(0), \dots, 
    \Gamma(k)\subseteq V$ that will guide our construction of the subgraph $B$.
    To do so, we define
    \begin{align*}
        \Gamma(0) &= \{ v \in V : \text{$v$ satisfies $\Pro$} \}, \\
        \Gamma(i) &= \{ v \in V : \deg^+_{\Gamma(i-1)}(v) \geq 2\ell^k \}\text{ for $1\leq i \leq k$.}
    \end{align*}
    \noindent
    The significance of the sets $\Gamma(i)$ is given by the following claim.
    
    \begin{claim}\label{claim:Gamma(k)_nonempty_implies_win}
    $\Gamma(k)\neq \emptyset$.
    \end{claim}
    Assuming Claim~\ref{claim:Gamma(k)_nonempty_implies_win}, we conclude the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:outstar_with_leaves_property} as follows. Take some vertex $v\in \Gamma(k)$.
    We construct $B$ greedily from $v$ as the root.       
    For $i=0,\dots,k$ we will inductively construct $B_i$, a copy of $B^+_{i,\ell}$ in $G$, such that the leaves of $B_{i}$ (resp.~the single vertex of $B_0$) belong to $\Gamma(k-i)$.
    In particular, the leaves of $B_k$, a copy of $B^+_{k,\ell}$ in $G$, will satisfy $\Pro$ as they will belong to $\Gamma(0)$, so we can take $B=B_k$.
    
    To construct the trees $B_i$, set $B_0 = \{v\}$ and define $B_1$ to be an out-star with $v$ as the centre and $\ell$ of its out-neighbours in $\Gamma(k-1)$, which exist since $\deg^+_{\Gamma(k-1)}(v) \geq 2\ell^k > \ell$, as leaves.
    Now suppose we have constructed the tree $B_i$ for some $1\leq i \leq k-1$, and let  $L \subseteq \Gamma(k-i)$ be the set of its leaves.
    We have 
    \[
        \card{V(B_i)} = \sum_{j=0}^{i} \ell^j\leq 2\ell^{k-1},
    \]
    while $\deg^+_{\Gamma(k-i-1)}(w) \geq 2\ell^k$ for each $w\in L$. Hence, every $w\in L$ has at least $\ell^k$ neighbours in  $\Gamma(k-i-1)\setminus V(B_i)$. Since $\card{L} \leq \ell^{k-1}$, we can greedily choose for each $w\in L$ a set of $\ell$ out-neighbours in $\Gamma(k-i-1)\setminus V(B_i)$, such that the resulting sets are pairwise disjoint. These sets together with $B_i$ form a copy of $B_{i+1,\ell}^+$ in $G$, whose leaves belong to $\Gamma(k-i-1)$. We take this tree to be $B_{i+1}$.
\end{proof}
  
It remains to prove Claim~\ref{claim:Gamma(k)_nonempty_implies_win}. To this end, we partition the vertices of $G$ according to their presence in the sets $\Gamma(i)$.
That is, for a vertex $v\in V$ and an integer $0\leq i\leq k$, let $z_i(v)=1$ if $v\in \Gamma(i)$, and $z_i(v)=0$ otherwise, and let  $z(v) =(z_0(v),\dots,z_k(v))$. Conversely, for a vector $z =(z_0,\dots,z_k)\in \{0,1\}^{k+1}$ we set
\[
    V_z = \{ v \in V : z=z(v) \}
    .
\]
In this notation, Claim~\ref{claim:Gamma(k)_nonempty_implies_win} states that $V_z\neq \emptyset$ for some $z=(z_0,\dots,z_k)$ with $z_k = 1$.

Denote by $\prec$ the lexicographic ordering on $\{0,1\}^{\{0,\dots,k\}}$.
That is, for two vectors $z=(z_0\dots,z_k)$ and $z'=(z'_0,\dots,z'_k)$, we write $z \prec z'$ if there is an index $0\leq i \leq k$ such that $z_i = 0, z'_i = 1$ and $z_j = z'_j$ for all $j > i$.
We highlight the following property of the ordering.
\begin{observation}\label{obs:lex_order_property}
    If $z' \succ z$ and $z'_k = 0$, then there is an index $ i \leq k-1$ such that $z'_i = 1$ and $z_{i+1} = 0$.
\end{observation}
\noindent
We denote by $\vec{0}$ the all-zero vector $\vec{0} \in \{0,1\}^{k+1}$, and put $X=V_{\vec{0}}=V\setminus\bigcup_{i=0}^k\Gamma(i)$.

\begin{proof}[Proof of Claim~\ref{claim:Gamma(k)_nonempty_implies_win}]
    Suppose for a contradiction that $\Gamma_k=\emptyset$, or equivalently, 
    $V_{z'}=\emptyset$ for all $z'=(z'_0,\dots,z'_{k-1},1)$. Let $z =(z_0,\dots,z_k)$ be the $\prec$-smallest vector such that $V_z \not= \emptyset$; by the above assumption we have $z_k=0$. Let 
    \[
        I=\Big\{i \in \{0,\dots, k-1\}: z_{i+1}=0\Big\} \ \ \text{and} \ \
        W=\bigcup_{i\in I}\Gamma(i).
    \]
    We claim that
    \begin{align*}
        V =
        \begin{cases}
            W        &\text{ if } z \not= \vec{0},\\
            W \cup X &\text{ if } z = \vec{0}.
        \end{cases}
    \end{align*}
    Indeed, $\{V_{z'}:z'\in \{0,1\}^{k+1}\}$ is a partition of $V$, and for a vector $z'=(z'_0,\dots,z'_k)$, we have the following options:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item if $z'_k = 1$, then $V_{z'} = \emptyset$ by assumption,
        \item if $z' \prec z$, we have $V_{z'} = \emptyset$ by the minimality of $z$,
        \item if $z' \succ z$ and $z'_k = 0$, then, by Observation~\ref{obs:lex_order_property}, for some $0\leq i \leq k-1$ we have $z'_i = 1$ and $z_{i+1} = 0$ . Therefore, $i\in I$ and $V_{z'} \subseteq \Gamma(i)\subseteq W$,
        \item lastly, if $z' = z \not= \vec{0}$, then, as $z_k=0$, for some $0\leq i \leq k-1$ we have $z_i = 1$ and $z_{i+1} = 0$. Therefore, $i\in I$ and $V_{z'} \subseteq \Gamma(i)\subseteq W$.
    \end{enumerate}
\noindent
    Let now $v\in V_z$ be an arbitrary vertex (recall that $V_z\neq \emptyset$ by definition of the vector $z$).
    For each $i\in I$ we have $v\notin \Gamma(i+1)$, as $z_{i+1}=0$. Hence,
    $\deg^+_{\Gamma(i)}(v)<2\ell^k$. Taking the sum over all $i\in I$ gives 
    \[
        \deg^+_W(v) < 2k\ell^k.
    \]
    So, if $z \not= \vec{0}$, then due to $V=W$, we get 
    \[
        2k\ell^k > \deg^+_W(v) = \deg^+(v) \geq \delta^+(G) \geq 2k\ell^k,
    \]
    a contradiction. 
    
    \noindent
    While if $z = \vec{0}$, we obtain 
    \[
        d_X^+(v) \geq \delta^+(G) - \deg^+_W(v) \geq \delta^+(G) - 2k\ell^k \geq d(\Pro).
    \]
    Since in this case $v$ was an arbitrary vertex of $V_z=V_{\vec{0}}=X$, it follows that the induced subgraph $G[X]$ satisfies $\delta^+(G[X]) \geq d(\Pro)$. Thus, there is a vertex $x \in X$ that satisfies the property $\Pro$ in $G[X]$.
    However, by the antimonotonicity of $\Pro$, $x$ must also satisfy $\Pro$ in $G$, meaning $x\in \Gamma(0)$. This is a contradiction with the fact that
    \[
        x \in X =V_{\vec{0}}\subseteq V\setminus \Gamma(0).
    \]
    Hence, our initial assumption that $\Gamma(k)=0$ was contradictory, and we must have $\Gamma(k)\neq 0$. 
\end{proof}\section{Giant spiders exist}\label{sec:spiders}

In this section we prove Theorem~\ref{thm:linear_spiders}, which gives a linear bound on the minimum out-degree that guarantees a copy of $\smtwol$.

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:linear_spiders}]
    Let $\ell\geq 1$ be fixed and $G = (V, E)$ be a digraph with $\delta^+(G) \geq d$, where $d> \left(\frac{3+\sqrt{17}}{2} \right)\ell$. By removing edges if necessary, we may assume that $\deg^+(v) = d$ for every vertex $v \in V$. We remark that this seemingly insignificant assumption is crucial for our argument. Our goal is to find a copy of $\smtwol$ in $G$. To this end, we partition $V$ into subsets $A$ and $B$, where 
    $$A = \{v \in V : \deg^-(v) \geq 2\ell\} \ \ \text{ and} \ \ B =\{v \in V : \deg^-(v) < 2\ell\},$$
    and note that $A\neq \emptyset$, since the average in-degree in $G$ is $d>2\ell$.

    If there exists a vertex $r \in A$ such that $\deg^-_A(r) \geq 2\ell$, we exhibit a copy of $\smtwol$ in $G$ by choosing greedily distinct vertices $a_1, x_1, a_2,x_2,\dots, a_\ell, x_\ell \in V$, such that $a_i\in N^-_A(r)$ and $x_i\in N^-_V(a_i)$.
    We will not run out of vertices: having chosen $a_1, x_1, \dots, a_i,x_i$ for some $0 \leq i < \ell$, $a_{i+1} \in A$ can be picked distinctly  because $r$ has at least $2\ell$ in-neighbours in $A$ and at most $2i<2\ell$ of them have already been chosen.
    Similarly, $x_{i+1}$ can be picked distinctly since $a_{i+1} \in A$ has at least $2\ell$ in-neighbours and at most $2i+1<2\ell$ of them have already been chosen. 

    Thus, for the rest of the proof we may assume that $\deg^-_A(v) \leq 2\ell-1$ for every $v \in A$. For three sets $X,Y,Z \subseteq V$, not necessarily distinct, we denote by $X \rightarrow Y \rightarrow Z$ the set of all $2$-edge directed paths, with the vertex set $\{x,y,z\}$ for some $x \in X$, $y\in Y$, and $z \in Z$ and the edges $\{(x,y),(y,z)\}$.

    \begin{figure}[htbp]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{fig_VBA_paths.pdf}
        \caption{An example of two paths in $V \rightarrow B \rightarrow A$, one starting in $B$ and the other in $A$.}
    \end{figure}
    
    Observe that
    \begin{align*}
        \card{V \rightarrow B \rightarrow A} &=  \card{V \rightarrow B \rightarrow V} - \card{V \rightarrow B \rightarrow B}\\
        &= \card{A \rightarrow B \rightarrow V} + \card{B \rightarrow B \rightarrow V} - \card{V \rightarrow B \rightarrow B}\\
        &= \card{A \rightarrow V \rightarrow V} - \card{A \rightarrow A \rightarrow V} + \card{B \rightarrow B \rightarrow V} - \card{V \rightarrow B \rightarrow B}, 
    \end{align*}
    and let us estimate the terms in the last expression.
    Because $\deg^+(v)=d$ for all $v$, $\deg^-_A(v) \leq 2\ell-1$ for every $v \in A$, and $\deg^-(v) \leq 2\ell-1$ for every $v \in B$, we obtain:
    \begin{align*}
        \card{A \rightarrow V \rightarrow V} &\geq \card{A} d(d-1), \\
        \card{A \rightarrow A \rightarrow V} &\leq e(G[A]) d \leq (2\ell-1) d\card{A}, \\
        \card{B \rightarrow B \rightarrow V} &\geq e(G[B])(d-1), \\
        \card{V \rightarrow B \rightarrow B} &\leq e(G[B])(2\ell-1).
    \end{align*}
    Hence
    \begin{align*}
        \card{V \rightarrow B \rightarrow A} &\geq d(d-1)\card{A} - (2\ell-1) d\card{A} + e(G[B])(d-1) - e(G[B])(2\ell-1) \\
            &\geq d(d - 2\ell )\card{A} + e(G[B])(d - 2\ell)\\
            &\geq d(d - 2\ell)\card{A}.
    \end{align*} 
    By the pigeonhole principle, there exists a vertex $a \in A$ such that 
    \[
        \card{V \rightarrow B \rightarrow \{a\}} \geq d(d-2\ell).
    \]

    Let $s$ be maximal such that there exists $S=\{b_1,\dots,b_s\}\subseteq N_B^-(a)$ and $Q=\{q_1,\dots,q_s\}\subseteq V\setminus (S\cup \{a\})$ with $(q_i,b_i)\in E$ for all $1\leq i\leq s$. Note that this gives a copy of $S^-_{2,s}$ in $G$. Since the in-degrees in $B$ are at most $2\ell$, we have 
    \[
        \card{V \rightarrow S \rightarrow \{a\}} \leq 2 \ell s,
    \]
    and consequently
    \[
        \card{V \rightarrow B\setminus S \rightarrow \{a\}} \geq  d(d-2\ell) - 2\ell s.
    \]
    By maximality of $s$, all these paths have their first vertex in $Q$.
    Hence, for some $1\leq i\leq s$ we have
    \[
        d=\deg^+(q_i)\geq \card{\{q_i\}\rightarrow B\setminus S \rightarrow \{a\}} \geq \frac{d(d-2\ell) - 2\ell s}{s},
    \]
    resulting in 
    \[
        s\geq \frac{d(d-2\ell)}{d+2\ell}.
    \]
    The last expression is greater than $\ell$ for $d>\left(\frac{3+\sqrt{17}}{2}\right)\ell$, since $\frac{3+\sqrt{17}}{2}$ is the positive root of the underlying quadratic equation. Thus, $G$ contains a copy of $\smtwol$.
