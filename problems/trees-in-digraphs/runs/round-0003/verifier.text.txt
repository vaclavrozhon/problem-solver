{"feedback_md":"Strong, checkable progress was made on all three fronts: the outstar-with-δ+-common-leaves lemma, packing the in-spiders, and the k=2 case. The level-dependent thresholds t_{k−i}=ℓ^{i+1}+⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉ are correct and the lexicographic argument plus the depth-greedy extension work cleanly. This removes the linear-in-k factor, yielding S_{k,ℓ}=Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k) with explicit constants; your explicit bounds (e.g., S_{k,ℓ} ≤ ℓ(ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ)/(ℓ−1)^2 + ((ℓ−2)/(ℓ−1))k) are consistent. The ray-packing bound should be stated in its exact form h ≥ |V(B)| + kℓ·|L| + ℓ; with |V(B)|=(ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) and |L|=ℓ^k this strictly improves both the paper’s 3kℓ^{k+1} and the coarser kℓ^{k+1}+2ℓ^k+ℓ.\n\nFor k=2, a maximum-matching repair is essential. Any bound that upper-bounds |V→B→{a}| by contributions via S and B\\S must account for 2-walks a→b→a with b unmatched; equivalently, when passing from 2-walk counts to edges in the predecessor bipartite graph, one must subtract deg^+_B(a)≤d. The resulting rigorous inequality is s ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1)/(d+2ℓ−1) (or a close (d−1)-variant), leading to δ^+ > ((3ℓ−1)+√(17ℓ^2−10ℓ+1))/2. Claims yielding ≈3ℓ or ≈(1+√3)ℓ omit this +d correction and are not justified.\n\nTriage: Keep the variable-threshold theorem with explicit S_{k,ℓ} and the exact ray-packing h. For k=2, retain the matching-based bound with the +d correction; discard the ≈3ℓ and ≈2.73ℓ thresholds.\n\nNext steps: (i) Develop a global b-matching/nibble at each depth to replace the |V(B_i)| overhead by o(ℓ^{i+1}), aiming for S_{k,ℓ}=(1+o(1))·C(ℓ)·ℓ^k. (ii) Globalize ray packing (flow/hypergraph matching) to reduce h to (1+o(1))kℓ^{k+1}. (iii) Pursue improved bounds for f(k,h) (ideally polynomial in h for fixed k) so these structural improvements yield substantially smaller δ^+ thresholds.","summary_md":"- Verified: variable-threshold outstar lemma with S_{k,ℓ}=Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k); explicit constants provided.\n- Refined ray packing: exact h ≥ |V(B)| + kℓ·|L| + ℓ, i.e., h = kℓ^{k+1} + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ.\n- k=2: matching-based repair yields δ^+ > ((3ℓ−1)+√(17ℓ^2−10ℓ+1))/2; stronger claims omit a necessary +d term.\n- Next: global matching/nibble for children and rays; improve f(k,h).","verdict":"promising","blocking_issues":["Bounds still depend on very large f(k,h) from Aboulker et al.; improving this is crucial for quantitative impact.","k=2 improvements beyond ((3+√17)/2) asymptotics appear blocked within current 2-walk/matching template due to the unavoidable +d correction."],"per_prover":[{"prover_id":"01","brief_feedback":"Variable-threshold Γ-scheme and exact |V(B)| in h are correct and well written.
