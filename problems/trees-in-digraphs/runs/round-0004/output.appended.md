# Main Results

- Outstar-with-δ+-common-leaves (refined). For ℓ≥2, k≥1, and any δ+-common property P with threshold d(P), if
  δ^+(G) ≥ d(P) + S_{k,ℓ},
  where S_{k,ℓ}=∑_{i=1}^k t_i with t_k=ℓ and t_{k−i}=ℓ^{i+1}+⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉ (1≤i≤k−1), then G contains B^+_{k,ℓ} whose leaves all satisfy P. In particular, S_{k,ℓ}=Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k) (no factor k); e.g., S_{k,ℓ} ≤ ℓ(ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ)/(ℓ−1)^2 + O(k).

- Packing in-spiders at the leaves (refined h). It suffices to take
  h = kℓ^{k+1} + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ
  (improving the earlier kℓ^{k+1}+2ℓ^k+ℓ and the paper’s 3kℓ^{k+1}). Consequently, δ^+(G) ≥ f(k,h) + S_{k,ℓ} guarantees a copy of T(k,ℓ).

- k=2 Giant Spiders. Any digraph with
  δ^+ > ((3ℓ−1)+√(17ℓ^2−10ℓ+1))/2
  contains S^-_{2,ℓ}. This corrects the proof via a maximum-matching argument (accounting for 2-walks starting at a) and improves finite-ℓ constants while matching the (3+√17)/2 asymptotics.
