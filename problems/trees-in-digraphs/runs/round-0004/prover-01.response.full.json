Let \u03a0 be a \u03b4^+-common vertex property with threshold d(\u03a0). Fix integers \u2113 \u2265 2 and k \u2265 1. Define \u0393(0) = {v : v satisfies \u03a0} and, for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k,\\n\u0393(j) = { v : deg^+_{\u0393(j\u22121)}(v) \u2265 t_j },\\nwhere for i = 0,\u2026,k\u22121 we set\\n t_{k\u2212i} := \u2113^{i+1} + \u2308(\u2113^{i+1} \u2212 1)/(\u2113 \u2212 1)\u2309,\\nand we take t_k = \u2113 (this is the i=0 instance).\\nIf \u03b4^+(G) \u2265 d(\u03a0) + S_{k,\u2113}, where\\n S_{k,\u2113} := \u2211_{j=1}^k t_j = \u2211_{r=1}^k (\u2113^r + \u2308(\u2113^r \u2212 1)/(\u2113 \u2212 1)\u2309),\\nthen G contains a copy B \u2245 B^+_{k,\u2113} such that all leaves of B satisfy \u03a0.\\n\\nProof (concise and checkable). The lexicographic partition argument of the paper (Claim 3.8) works unchanged with thresholds t_j. Assuming \u0393(k)=\u2205, let z be the lexicographically minimal nonempty class with z_k=0, I := {i : z_{i+1}=0}, W := \u22c3_{i\u2208I} \u0393(i). For v \u2208 V_z we have deg^+_W(v) < \u2211_{i\u2208I} t_{i+1} \u2264 S_{k,\u2113}. If z \u2260 0\u20d7, this contradicts \u03b4^+(G) \u2265 S_{k,\u2113}; if z = 0\u20d7, then for all v \u2208 X := V \\\\ \u22c3_{j=0}^k \u0393(j), deg^+_X(v) \u2265 \u03b4^+(G) \u2212 S_{k,\u2113} \u2265 d(\u03a0), producing a \u03a0-vertex in X and contradicting anti-monotonicity. Thus \u0393(k) \u2260 \u2205.\\nLet v \u2208 \u0393(k). Build B_i \u2245 B^+_{i,\u2113} inductively with leaves L_i \u2286 \u0393(k\u2212i), |L_i|=\u2113^i, |V(B_i)|=(\u2113^{i+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121). To construct B_{i+1}, process leaves w \u2208 L_i in an arbitrary order, selecting \u2113 out-neighbours in \u0393(k\u2212i\u22121) outside V(B_i) and disjoint across different leaves. At the j-th leaf, at most |V(B_i)|+\u2113(j\u22121) neighbours are forbidden. Hence it suffices that every w satisfy\\n deg^+_{\u0393(k\u2212i\u22121)}(w) \u2265 |V(B_i)| + \u2113|L_i| = (\u2113^{i+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121) + \u2113^{i+1} = t_{k\u2212i}.\\nFor i=0, this reads deg^+_{\u0393(k\u22121)}(v) \u2265 t_k = \u2113, which ensures an out-star of size \u2113 rooted at v. Hence B_k exists with all its leaves in \u0393(0), i.e., all leaves satisfy \u03a0.\\n\\nExact closed form and growth of S_{k,\u2113}. Using \u2308x\u2309 = x + \u03b5_r with 0 \u2264 \u03b5_r < 1,\\nS_{k,\u2113} = \u2211_{r=1}^k \u2113^r + \u2211_{r=1}^k (\u2113^r \u2212 1)/(\u2113\u22121) + \u2211_{r=1}^k \u03b5_r\\n= (\u2113^{k+1}\u2212\u2113)/(\u2113\u22121) + (\u2113^{k+1}\u2212\u2113)/(\u2113\u22121)^2 \u2212 k/(\u2113\u22121) + E_k,\\nwhere 0 \u2264 E_k < k. In particular,\\nS_{k,\u2113} = (\u2113^2/(\u2113\u22121)^2)\u00b7\u2113^k + O_\u2113(1),\\nso S_{k,\u2113} = \u0398_\u2113(\u2113^k) with no multiplicative factor k. For \u2113=2 we get the exact formula S_{k,2} = 4\u00b72^k \u2212 4 \u2212 k.\\n\\nRefinement 2: Packing the in-spiders at the leaves\\n\\nLemma B (greedy ray packing with exact |V(B)|). Let B \u2245 B^+_{k,\u2113} with leaves L (|L|=\u2113^k). For each w \u2208 L, let S(w) \u2245 S^-_{k,h} be any selected copy in G centred at w. If\\n h \u2265 |V(B)| + k\u2113\u00b7|L| + \u2113 = (\u2113^{k+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121) + k\u2113^{k+1} + \u2113,\\nthen one can greedily choose for every w a subcopy S\u2032(w) \u2245 S^-_{k,\u2113}, such that these S\u2032(w) are pairwise vertex-disjoint and disjoint from B except at their centre.\\n\\nProof. Process w \u2208 L in any order. Let U be the union of B and the already chosen S\u2032. Within S(w), every vertex of U\\\\{w} blocks at most one ray of S(w), so the number of blocked rays is at most |U|\u22121. Since at every step |U| \u2264 |V(B)| + k\u2113(|L|\u22121), the condition on h ensures that at least \u2113 rays in S(w) remain unblocked, and we can choose S\u2032(w).\\n\\nCorollary C (refined T(k,\u2113) threshold). With h* := (\u2113^{k+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121) + k\u2113^{k+1} + \u2113 and S_{k,\u2113} from Theorem A, if \u03b4^+(G) \u2265 f(k,h*) + S_{k,\u2113}, then G contains T(k,\u2113).\\n\\nProof. Take \u03a0 = \u201ccentre of S^-_{k,h*}\u201d. Apply Theorem A to find B with all leaves satisfying \u03a0; then use Lemma B to attach S\u2032(w), w \u2208 L, as required.\\n\\nRepair and strengthening for k=2 spiders\\n\\nTheorem D (k=2, matching/vertex-cover repair). Let \u2113 \u2265 1. If \u03b4^+(G) = d > d_*(\u2113) := ((3\u2113\u22121) + \u221a(17\u2113^2 \u2212 10\u2113 + 1))/2, then G contains S^-_{2,\u2113}.\\n\\nProof. As in the paper, delete edges to make deg^+(v)=d for all v. Partition V into A := {deg^\u2212 \u2265 2\u2113} and B := V\\\\A. If some r \u2208 A has deg^-_A(r) \u2265 2\u2113, greedily embed S^-_{2,\u2113}. Otherwise, deg^-_A(\u00b7) \u2264 2\u2113\u22121 on A. Counting directed 2-walks gives |V \u21d2 B \u21d2 A| \u2265 |A| d(d\u22122\u2113+1). Pick a \u2208 A with T := |V \u21d2 B \u21d2 {a}| \u2265 d(d\u22122\u2113+1). Let R := N^-_B(a), U := V\\\\{a}, and consider the bipartite predecessor graph H with parts (U,R), edges q\u2014b iff (q,b) \u2208 E. Then |E(H)| = T \u2212 deg^+_B(a) \u2265 d(d\u22122\u2113+1) \u2212 d. By K\u0151nig\u2019s theorem, if s is the maximum matching size and C a minimum vertex cover, |C|=s, we have\\n |E(H)| \u2264 \u2211_{q\u2208C\u2229U} deg^+(q) + \u2211_{b\u2208C\u2229R} deg^\u2212(b) \u2264 d|C\u2229U| + (2\u2113\u22121)|C\u2229R| \u2264 (d + 2\u2113 \u2212 1)s.\\nHence s \u2265 d(d\u22122\u2113)/(d+2\u2113\u22121). If s \u2265 \u2113 we obtain S^-_{2,\u2113}. Solving s \u2265 \u2113 gives d > d_*(\u2113).\\n\\nRemarks. This corrects the gap in the original argument by accounting for 2-walks starting at a (subtracting \u2264 d). Numerically this improves finite-\u2113 constants over the paper, while matching (3+\u221a17)/2 asymptotically.\\n\\nConditional improvement via global b-matching (next-step scaffold)\\n\\nStatement (conditional b-matching lemma at depth i). Consider the bipartite graph H_i between L_i (|L_i|=\u2113^i) and R_i := \u0393(k\u2212i\u22121). Suppose\\n- every w \u2208 L_i has deg_{H_i}(w) \u2265 D_i,\\n- every v \u2208 R_i has degree at most \u0394_i (a codegree/capacity control),\\n- H_i has maximum codegree among distinct w,w\u2032 on R_i bounded by \u03bb_i \u226a D_i.\\nThen for D_i \u2273 \u2113\u00b7(1+\u03b5) and \u03bb_i \u226a D_i one can (by the R\u00f6dl nibble/Pippenger\u2013Spencer method for near-regular bipartite graphs) find a b-matching that assigns to each w \u2208 L_i exactly \u2113 distinct neighbours in R_i, pairwise disjoint across L_i.\\n\\nConsequence (conditional threshold). Under the above, it suffices to require\\n D_i \u2265 \u2113 + c\u221a(\u2113 log |L_i|) + O(\u03bb_i),\\nfor an absolute constant c, up to polylog factors, rather than D_i \u2265 |V(B_i)| + \u2113|L_i| from the greedy method. Summed over i, this would reduce S_{k,\u2113} from \u0398_\u2113(\u2113^k) with a nontrivial constant to (1+o(1))\u00b7\u2113^k in the regime where \u03bb_i = o(\u2113^{i+1}).\\n\\nWhy this is useful. It gives a concrete pathway to push S_{k,\u2113} towards the information-theoretic lower bound \u2113^{k} (since |L_i|=\u2113^i and each leaf requires \u2113 children) in graphs where the \u0393-structure does not concentrate too heavily (small codegrees). The current \u03b4^+-only hypothesis does not itself control \u03bb_i; identifying structural consequences of large minimum out-degree that bound \u03bb_i (even weakly) would unlock unconditional improvements.\\n\\nExamples and numerics\\n\\n- Exact S_{k,2}. With \u2113=2 we have t_{k\u2212i} = 2^{i+1} + (2^{i+1} \u2212 1) = 2^{i+2} \u2212 1, so\\n  S_{k,2} = \u2211_{i=0}^{k\u22121} (2^{i+2} \u2212 1) = 4\u00b72^k \u2212 4 \u2212 k.\\n- Refined h. For \u2113=2, h* = (2^{k+1}\u22121) + k\u00b72^{k+1} + 2 = (k+1)\u00b72^{k+1} + 1.\\n\\nObstacles\\n\\n- Unconditional global b-matching: without any control on codegrees in H_i, a pathological concentration can force the greedy-sized thresholds. Thus, to proceed, we must either derive codegree bounds from the \u03b4^+-hypothesis (e.g., via a sparse-regularization lemma inside \u0393-layers) or accept conditional statements.\\n- Ray packing: the bound h* is tight within the greedy framework, since in the worst case almost all already chosen vertices could lie inside a given S(w), each blocking a distinct ray. Improvements likely require a global packing argument across all S(w), which again hinges on controlling overlaps (a hypergraph codegree issue).\\n\\nNext steps\\n\\n- Derive a \u201c\u0393-regularization\u201d lemma: from \u03b4^+(G) \u2265 d and the anti-monotone definition of \u0393, extract large subsets R_i \u2286 \u0393(k\u2212i\u22121) with bounded codegrees for L_i, sufficient to run a nibble. Even very weak bounds (e.g., \u03bb_i \u2264 D_i^0.9) would materially reduce S_{k,\u2113}.\\n- Attempt a global ray packing via flow in a layered auxiliary network whose arcs represent rays in S(w), using capacities k per leaf and 1 per internal vertex; establish sufficient Hall-type conditions.\\n- Investigate k=3 spiders: try to extend the matching argument to two layers B\u2192C\u2192a with a flow across a layered network, aiming for a provable linear threshold d > c\u00b7\u2113 with c < 3.56.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n- Pippenger, N., and J.
