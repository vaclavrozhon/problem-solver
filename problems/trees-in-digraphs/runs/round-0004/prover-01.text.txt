Ideas

- Tighten and stabilize the “outstar with δ+-common leaves” theorem by giving exact level thresholds and an exact closed form for the total additive overhead S_{k,ℓ}, as well as a clean derivation that t_k=ℓ is sufficient at the base level.
- Sharpen the ray-packing bound by keeping the exact |V(B)| rather than a coarse bound and summarize the precise choice of h.
- Repair and finalize the k=2 spider bound using a maximum-matching/vertex-cover calculation that correctly subtracts the contribution of 2-walks starting at a.
- Provide a conditional b-matching improvement at each level that (under a mild codegree assumption) would reduce the additive overhead towards the “pure” ℓ^{i+1} demand, explaining what remains to be proved to remove the condition.

Refinement 1: Outstar with δ+-common leaves (variable thresholds, exact S_{k,ℓ})

Theorem A (variable thresholds, exact sum). Let Π be a δ^+-common vertex property with threshold d(Π). Fix integers ℓ ≥ 2 and k ≥ 1. Define Γ(0) = {v : v satisfies Π} and, for 1 ≤ j ≤ k,
Γ(j) = { v : deg^+_{Γ(j−1)}(v) ≥ t_j },
where for i = 0,…,k−1 we set
 t_{k−i} := ℓ^{i+1} + ⌈(ℓ^{i+1} − 1)/(ℓ − 1)⌉,
and we take t_k = ℓ (this is the i=0 instance).
If δ^+(G) ≥ d(Π) + S_{k,ℓ}, where
 S_{k,ℓ} := ∑_{j=1}^k t_j = ∑_{r=1}^k (ℓ^r + ⌈(ℓ^r − 1)/(ℓ − 1)⌉),
then G contains a copy B ≅ B^+_{k,ℓ} such that all leaves of B satisfy Π.

Proof (concise and checkable). The lexicographic partition argument of the paper (Claim 3.8) works unchanged with thresholds t_j. Assuming Γ(k)=∅, let z be the lexicographically minimal nonempty class with z_k=0, I := {i : z_{i+1}=0}, W := ⋃_{i∈I} Γ(i). For v ∈ V_z we have deg^+_W(v) < ∑_{i∈I} t_{i+1} ≤ S_{k,ℓ}. If z ≠ 0⃗, this contradicts δ^+(G) ≥ S_{k,ℓ}; if z = 0⃗, then for all v ∈ X := V \ ⋃_{j=0}^k Γ(j), deg^+_X(v) ≥ δ^+(G) − S_{k,ℓ} ≥ d(Π), producing a Π-vertex in X and contradicting anti-monotonicity. Thus Γ(k) ≠ ∅.
Let v ∈ Γ(k). Build B_i ≅ B^+_{i,ℓ} inductively with leaves L_i ⊆ Γ(k−i), |L_i|=ℓ^i, |V(B_i)|=(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1). To construct B_{i+1}, process leaves w ∈ L_i in an arbitrary order, selecting ℓ out-neighbours in Γ(k−i−1) outside V(B_i) and disjoint across different leaves. At the j-th leaf, at most |V(B_i)|+ℓ(j−1) neighbours are forbidden. Hence it suffices that every w satisfy
 deg^+_{Γ(k−i−1)}(w) ≥ |V(B_i)| + ℓ|L_i| = (ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ^{i+1} = t_{k−i}.
For i=0, this reads deg^+_{Γ(k−1)}(v) ≥ t_k = ℓ, which ensures an out-star of size ℓ rooted at v. Hence B_k exists with all its leaves in Γ(0), i.e., all leaves satisfy Π.

Exact closed form and growth of S_{k,ℓ}. Using ⌈x⌉ = x + ε_r with 0 ≤ ε_r < 1,
S_{k,ℓ} = ∑_{r=1}^k ℓ^r + ∑_{r=1}^k (ℓ^r − 1)/(ℓ−1) + ∑_{r=1}^k ε_r
= (ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ)/(ℓ−1) + (ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ)/(ℓ−1)^2 − k/(ℓ−1) + E_k,
where 0 ≤ E_k < k. In particular,
S_{k,ℓ} = (ℓ^2/(ℓ−1)^2)·ℓ^k + O_ℓ(1),
so S_{k,ℓ} = Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k) with no multiplicative factor k. For ℓ=2 we get the exact formula S_{k,2} = 4·2^k − 4 − k.

Refinement 2: Packing the in-spiders at the leaves

Lemma B (greedy ray packing with exact |V(B)|). Let B ≅ B^+_{k,ℓ} with leaves L (|L|=ℓ^k). For each w ∈ L, let S(w) ≅ S^-_{k,h} be any selected copy in G centred at w. If
 h ≥ |V(B)| + kℓ·|L| + ℓ = (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + kℓ^{k+1} + ℓ,
then one can greedily choose for every w a subcopy S′(w) ≅ S^-_{k,ℓ}, such that these S′(w) are pairwise vertex-disjoint and disjoint from B except at their centre.

Proof. Process w ∈ L in any order. Let U be the union of B and the already chosen S′. Within S(w), every vertex of U\{w} blocks at most one ray of S(w), so the number of blocked rays is at most |U|−1. Since at every step |U| ≤ |V(B)| + kℓ(|L|−1), the condition on h ensures that at least ℓ rays in S(w) remain unblocked, and we can choose S′(w).

Corollary C (refined T(k,ℓ) threshold). With h* := (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + kℓ^{k+1} + ℓ and S_{k,ℓ} from Theorem A, if δ^+(G) ≥ f(k,h*) + S_{k,ℓ}, then G contains T(k,ℓ).

Proof. Take Π = “centre of S^-_{k,h*}”. Apply Theorem A to find B with all leaves satisfying Π; then use Lemma B to attach S′(w), w ∈ L, as required.

Repair and strengthening for k=2 spiders

Theorem D (k=2, matching/vertex-cover repair). Let ℓ ≥ 1. If δ^+(G) = d > d_*(ℓ) := ((3ℓ−1) + √(17ℓ^2 − 10ℓ + 1))/2, then G contains S^-_{2,ℓ}.

Proof. As in the paper, delete edges to make deg^+(v)=d for all v. Partition V into A := {deg^− ≥ 2ℓ} and B := V\A. If some r ∈ A has deg^-_A(r) ≥ 2ℓ, greedily embed S^-_{2,ℓ}. Otherwise, deg^-_A(·) ≤ 2ℓ−1 on A. Counting directed 2-walks gives |V ⇒ B ⇒ A| ≥ |A| d(d−2ℓ+1). Pick a ∈ A with T := |V ⇒ B ⇒ {a}| ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1). Let R := N^-_B(a), U := V\{a}, and consider the bipartite predecessor graph H with parts (U,R), edges q—b iff (q,b) ∈ E. Then |E(H)| = T − deg^+_B(a) ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1) − d. By Kőnig’s theorem, if s is the maximum matching size and C a minimum vertex cover, |C|=s, we have
 |E(H)| ≤ ∑_{q∈C∩U} deg^+(q) + ∑_{b∈C∩R} deg^−(b) ≤ d|C∩U| + (2ℓ−1)|C∩R| ≤ (d + 2ℓ − 1)s.
Hence s ≥ d(d−2ℓ)/(d+2ℓ−1). If s ≥ ℓ we obtain S^-_{2,ℓ}. Solving s ≥ ℓ gives d > d_*(ℓ).

Remarks. This corrects the gap in the original argument by accounting for 2-walks starting at a (subtracting ≤ d). Numerically this improves finite-ℓ constants over the paper, while matching (3+√17)/2 asymptotically.

Conditional improvement via global b-matching (next-step scaffold)

Statement (conditional b-matching lemma at depth i). Consider the bipartite graph H_i between L_i (|L_i|=ℓ^i) and R_i := Γ(k−i−1). Suppose
- every w ∈ L_i has deg_{H_i}(w) ≥ D_i,
- every v ∈ R_i has degree at most Δ_i (a codegree/capacity control),
- H_i has maximum codegree among distinct w,w′ on R_i bounded by λ_i ≪ D_i.
Then for D_i ≳ ℓ·(1+ε) and λ_i ≪ D_i one can (by the Rödl nibble/Pippenger–Spencer method for near-regular bipartite graphs) find a b-matching that assigns to each w ∈ L_i exactly ℓ distinct neighbours in R_i, pairwise disjoint across L_i.

Consequence (conditional threshold). Under the above, it suffices to require
 D_i ≥ ℓ + c√(ℓ log |L_i|) + O(λ_i),
for an absolute constant c, up to polylog factors, rather than D_i ≥ |V(B_i)| + ℓ|L_i| from the greedy method. Summed over i, this would reduce S_{k,ℓ} from Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k) with a nontrivial constant to (1+o(1))·ℓ^k in the regime where λ_i = o(ℓ^{i+1}).

Why this is useful. It gives a concrete pathway to push S_{k,ℓ} towards the information-theoretic lower bound ℓ^{k} (since |L_i|=ℓ^i and each leaf requires ℓ children) in graphs where the Γ-structure does not concentrate too heavily (small codegrees). The current δ^+-only hypothesis does not itself control λ_i; identifying structural consequences of large minimum out-degree that bound λ_i (even weakly) would unlock unconditional improvements.

Examples and numerics

- Exact S_{k,2}. With ℓ=2 we have t_{k−i} = 2^{i+1} + (2^{i+1} − 1) = 2^{i+2} − 1, so
  S_{k,2} = ∑_{i=0}^{k−1} (2^{i+2} − 1) = 4·2^k − 4 − k.
- Refined h. For ℓ=2, h* = (2^{k+1}−1) + k·2^{k+1} + 2 = (k+1)·2^{k+1} + 1.

Obstacles

- Unconditional global b-matching: without any control on codegrees in H_i, a pathological concentration can force the greedy-sized thresholds. Thus, to proceed, we must either derive codegree bounds from the δ^+-hypothesis (e.g., via a sparse-regularization lemma inside Γ-layers) or accept conditional statements.
- Ray packing: the bound h* is tight within the greedy framework, since in the worst case almost all already chosen vertices could lie inside a given S(w), each blocking a distinct ray. Improvements likely require a global packing argument across all S(w), which again hinges on controlling overlaps (a hypergraph codegree issue).

Next steps

- Derive a “Γ-regularization” lemma: from δ^+(G) ≥ d and the anti-monotone definition of Γ, extract large subsets R_i ⊆ Γ(k−i−1) with bounded codegrees for L_i, sufficient to run a nibble. Even very weak bounds (e.g., λ_i ≤ D_i^0.9) would materially reduce S_{k,ℓ}.
- Attempt a global ray packing via flow in a layered auxiliary network whose arcs represent rays in S(w), using capacities k per leaf and 1 per internal vertex; establish sufficient Hall-type conditions.
- Investigate k=3 spiders: try to extend the matching argument to two layers B→C→a with a flow across a layered network, aiming for a provable linear threshold d > c·ℓ with c < 3.56.
