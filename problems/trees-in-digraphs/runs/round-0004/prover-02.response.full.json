By averaging, \u2203 a\u2208A with\\n t := |V\u2192B\u2192{a}| \u2265 (d\u22121)(d\u22122\u2113+1).\\n\\nLet H be the predecessor bipartite graph with left L=V\\\\{a}, right R=N^-_B(a), and edges (q,b) for (q,b)\u2208E. Let M be a maximum matching with matched sets Q\u2282L and S\u2282R, s=|S|. Then no edges go from L\\\\Q to R\\\\S (augmenting paths would exist otherwise).\\n\\nSplit 2-walks via S and via B\\\\S. Note that 2-walks starting at a contribute deg^+_B(a)\u2264d but are not represented in H, so we use t\u2032:=t\u2212deg^+_B(a) \u2264 |E(H)|.

Any upper bound on |V\u2192B\u2192{a}| derived via a matching in H must account for the 2-walks starting at a (i.e., deg^+_B(a)\u2264d). Omitting this term leads to inadmissible bounds such as \u2248(1+\u221a3)\u2113.\\n\\n# Examples and checks\\n\\n- \u2113=2: S_{k,2}=4\u00b72^k\u2212k\u22125; the h bound gives h \u2265 k\u00b72^{3}\u00b72^{k\u22122}+(2^{k+1}\u22121)+2 = k\u00b72^{k+1} + 2^{k+1} + 1 = (k+1)2^{k+1} + 1, versus 3k\u00b72^{k+1} in the paper.\\n- k=2 threshold: d_*(2) = ((5)+\u221a(17\u00b74\u221220+1))/2 = (5+\u221a49)/2 = 6, so \u03b4^+>6 ensures S^-_{2,2}.\\n\\n# Obstacles\\n\\n- The bottleneck for T(k,\u2113) remains f(k,h) (existence of S^-_{k,h}); current proofs yield enormous bounds (\u223c\u2113^{k!}). Any polynomial-in-h bound (for fixed k) would drastically improve the final \u03b4^+ thresholds here.\\n- Within the greedy framework, the overhead term \u2308(\u2113^{i+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121)\u2309 is near-optimal: a worst-case where all leaves share candidates shows thresholds strictly below \u2113^{i+1}+|V(B_i)| can fail Hall\u2019s condition.\\n\\n# Next steps\\n\\n- Depth-wise global selection: Formulate a b-matching/nibble across all \u2113^i leaves at depth i to reduce the |V(B_i)| overhead toward o(\u2113^{i+1}), aiming for S_{k,\u2113}=(1+o_\u2113(1))\u00b7C(\u2113)\u00b7\u2113^k.\\n- Globalize ray packing: Treat choices of rays across all S(w) as a hypergraph matching; target h=(1+o(1))k\u2113^{k+1}.\\n- Toward polynomial f(k,h): Attempt a layering/expansion plus pruning argument to pack vertex-disjoint inward paths of fixed length k\u22121 to a centre; even h^{O(k)} would materially strengthen Corollary bounds.\\n\"}",
