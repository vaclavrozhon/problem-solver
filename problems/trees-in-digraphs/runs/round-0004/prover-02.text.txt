# Ideas

We consolidate and sharpen three quantitative components and add small, checkable refinements useful for curating proofs and outputs.

- Exact additive term for the outstar-with-δ+-common-leaves lemma (variable thresholds), including a closed form for ℓ=2 and clean asymptotics for general ℓ.
- A slightly stronger “ray packing” height bound h for attaching in-spiders at all leaves, written in the exact |V(B)| form and compared to previous bounds.
- A fully explicit, gap-free derivation for k=2 spiders via matching, keeping the necessary “+d correction,” and a precise threshold. Also, a short note clarifying why certain stronger-looking claims fail.

# 1) Out-arborescences with δ+-common leaves: exact S_{k,ℓ}

Setup. Let P be a δ^+-common property with threshold d(P). For k≥1, ℓ≥2 define Γ(0)= {v: v satisfies P} and, for 1≤i≤k,
Γ(i) = { v: deg^+_{Γ(i−1)}(v) ≥ t_i }.
Choose thresholds
- t_k := ℓ,
- for 1≤i≤k−1, t_{k−i} := ℓ^{i+1} + ⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉.

These ensure that at depth i there are, after removing previously used vertices |V(B_i)|=(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1), still ≥ℓ^{i+1} available neighbours per leaf, which suffices for a greedy, disjoint ℓ-extension across the ℓ^i leaves.

Lemma (Level-set contradiction, variable thresholds). If δ^+(G) ≥ d(P) + ∑_{i=1}^k t_i then Γ(k)≠∅. The lexicographic partition proof from the paper applies verbatim, replacing the uniform bound by the t_i.

Greedy construction. From any v∈Γ(k), construct B_0={v} and extend B_i→B_{i+1} by assigning ℓ disjoint children in Γ(k−i−1) to each leaf of B_i, avoiding V(B_i), which is feasible since t_{k−i}−|V(B_i)| ≥ ℓ^{i+1}.

Theorem A (Refined outstar-with-δ+-common-leaves). If
δ^+(G) ≥ d(P) + S_{k,ℓ},
where S_{k,ℓ}:=∑_{i=1}^k t_i = ℓ + ∑_{i=1}^{k−1} [ℓ^{i+1} + ⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉],
then G contains a copy of B^+_{k,ℓ} whose leaves all satisfy P.

Explicit bounds and exact formula for ℓ=2.
- For general ℓ≥2:
  S_{k,ℓ} ≤ ℓ + (ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ^2)/(ℓ−1) + (ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ^2)/(ℓ−1)^2 + O(k) = (ℓ^2/(ℓ−1)^2)·ℓ^k + O(ℓ^k) + O(k).
  In particular, S_{k,ℓ} = Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k) (no multiplicative k factor).
- For ℓ=2 one can compute exactly:
  t_k=2 and t_{k−i}=2^{i+2}−1 (1≤i≤k−1). Hence
  S_{k,2} = 2 + ∑_{i=1}^{k−1}(2^{i+2}−1) = 2^{k+2} − k − 5 = 4·2^k − k − 5.
  (Note this corrects the variant “4·2^k − 4 − k”.)

# 2) Ray packing at the leaves: exact height bound

Let B≅B^+_{k,ℓ}, L its ℓ^k leaves. For each w∈L let S(w)≅S^-_{k,h} be rooted at w. When selecting disjoint S′(w)≅S^-_{k,ℓ} one-by-one, in a fixed S(w):
- The vertices of B block at most |V(B)|−1 rays; here |V(B)|=(ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1).
- The previously selected S′(w′) over at most ℓ^k−1 leaves block ≤ kℓ(ℓ^k−1) rays (each contributes kℓ non-centre vertices, one per blocked ray).
Thus, fewer than kℓ^{k+1} + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) rays are blocked. Therefore it suffices that
h ≥ |V(B)| + kℓ·|L| + ℓ = kℓ^{k+1} + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ.
This strictly improves both 3kℓ^{k+1} and kℓ^{k+1}+2ℓ^k+ℓ, and is the tight statement in this local-greedy framework. Combined with Theorem A (P = “centre of S^-_{k,h}”), this yields δ^+(G) ≥ f(k,h)+S_{k,ℓ} ⇒ T(k,ℓ)⊂G.

# 3) k=2 spiders via matching: rigorous bound and threshold

We give a gap-free derivation with the necessary “+d correction”. Let G=(V,E) have deg^+(v)≡d. Define A={v: deg^-(v)≥2ℓ} and B=V\A. If ∃ r∈A with deg^-_A(r)≥2ℓ we greedily embed S^-_{2,ℓ}. Otherwise, deg^-_A(·)≤2ℓ−1 on A.

Counting distinct-vertex 2-edge paths:
- |A→V→V| ≥ |A|·d(d−1).
- |A→A→V| ≤ e(G[A])(d−1) ≤ (2ℓ−1)|A|(d−1).
- |B→B→V| ≥ e(G[B])(d−1), |V→B→B| ≤ e(G[B])(2ℓ−1).
Hence |V→B→A| ≥ |A|(d−1)(d−2ℓ+1). By averaging, ∃ a∈A with
 t := |V→B→{a}| ≥ (d−1)(d−2ℓ+1).

Let H be the predecessor bipartite graph with left L=V\{a}, right R=N^-_B(a), and edges (q,b) for (q,b)∈E. Let M be a maximum matching with matched sets Q⊂L and S⊂R, s=|S|. Then no edges go from L\Q to R\S (augmenting paths would exist otherwise).

Split 2-walks via S and via B\S. Note that 2-walks starting at a contribute deg^+_B(a)≤d but are not represented in H, so we use t′:=t−deg^+_B(a) ≤ |E(H)|. Now
- Via S: |V→S→{a}| ≤ ∑_{b∈S} deg^-(b) ≤ (2ℓ−1)s.
- Via B\S: only Q contributes; each q∈Q has ≥1 edge to S, so deg^+_{B\S}(q) ≤ d−1, thus |Q→(B\S)→{a}| ≤ s(d−1).
Therefore t′ ≤ s[(2ℓ−1)+(d−1)] = s(d+2ℓ−2), hence
 s ≥ t′/(d+2ℓ−2) ≥ [(d−1)(d−2ℓ+1) − d]/(d+2ℓ−2) ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1)/(d+2ℓ−1).
In particular, s≥ℓ (and so G contains S^-_{2,ℓ}) provided
 d > d_*(ℓ) := ((3ℓ−1) + √(17ℓ^2 − 10ℓ + 1))/2.
This corrects the “maximality” gap in the paper and strictly improves the finite-ℓ constants while preserving the asymptotic (3+√17)/2·ℓ.

Why stronger-looking claims fail. Any upper bound on |V→B→{a}| derived via a matching in H must account for the 2-walks starting at a (i.e., deg^+_B(a)≤d). Omitting this term leads to inadmissible bounds such as ≈(1+√3)ℓ.

# Examples and checks

- ℓ=2: S_{k,2}=4·2^k−k−5; the h bound gives h ≥ k·2^{3}·2^{k−2}+(2^{k+1}−1)+2 = k·2^{k+1} + 2^{k+1} + 1 = (k+1)2^{k+1} + 1, versus 3k·2^{k+1} in the paper.
- k=2 threshold: d_*(2) = ((5)+√(17·4−20+1))/2 = (5+√49)/2 = 6, so δ^+>6 ensures S^-_{2,2}.

# Obstacles

- The bottleneck for T(k,ℓ) remains f(k,h) (existence of S^-_{k,h}); current proofs yield enormous bounds (∼ℓ^{k!}). Any polynomial-in-h bound (for fixed k) would drastically improve the final δ^+ thresholds here.
- Within the greedy framework, the overhead term ⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉ is near-optimal: a worst-case where all leaves share candidates shows thresholds strictly below ℓ^{i+1}+|V(B_i)| can fail Hall’s condition.

# Next steps

- Depth-wise global selection: Formulate a b-matching/nibble across all ℓ^i leaves at depth i to reduce the |V(B_i)| overhead toward o(ℓ^{i+1}), aiming for S_{k,ℓ}=(1+o_ℓ(1))·C(ℓ)·ℓ^k.
- Globalize ray packing: Treat choices of rays across all S(w) as a hypergraph matching; target h=(1+o(1))kℓ^{k+1}.
- Toward polynomial f(k,h): Attempt a layering/expansion plus pruning argument to pack vertex-disjoint inward paths of fixed length k−1 to a centre; even h^{O(k)} would materially strengthen Corollary bounds.
