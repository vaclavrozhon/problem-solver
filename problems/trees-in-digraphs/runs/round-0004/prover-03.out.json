This clarifies constants used in \u03b4^+-common-leaves embeddings and removes ambiguity.\n- Sharpen the ray-packing bound by a small but exact \u22121 improvement and state it in its precise \u201ccounting rays blocked\u201d form; this is the tight version within the greedy framework.\n- Strengthen the outstar-with-\u03b4+-common-leaves lemma by enforcing, in addition, that the leaf set is independent (no edges among leaves), at the cost of a transparent O_\\ell(\\ell^k) additive term. This auxiliary property can reduce interference when attaching in-spiders in later steps.\n- For k=2 spiders, restate a rigorous matching-based bound consistent with the corrections already noted, and give small finite-\u2113 numerics for quick verification.\n\nLemma 1 (Exact closed form and bounds for S_{k,\\ell})\n\nSetup. For \\ell\u22652, k\u22651, define thresholds\n\\[t_k:=\\ell,\\qquad t_{k-i}:=\\ell^{i+1}+\\left\\lceil\\frac{\\ell^{i+1}-1}{\\ell-1}\\right\\rceil\\quad(1\\le i\\le k-1).\\]\nLet S_{k,\\ell}:=\\sum_{i=1}^k t_i.\n\nClaim. For all k,\\ell\u22652,\n\\[\\frac{\\ell(\\ell^{k+1}-\\ell)}{\\ell-1}+\\frac{\\ell^{k+1}-\\ell}{(\\ell-1)^2}-\\frac{k}{\\ell-1}\\ \\le\\ S_{k,\\ell}\\ \\le\\ \\frac{\\ell(\\ell^{k+1}-\\ell)}{\\ell-1}+\\frac{\\ell^{k+1}-\\ell}{(\\ell-1)^2}.\\]\nIn particular, S_{k,\\ell}=\\Theta_\\ell(\\ell^k) (no multiplicative factor k).\n\nProof. Writing |V(B_i)|=(\\ell^{i+1}\u22121)/(\\ell\u22121) and summing the exact expressions (bounding the ceilings by \u00b11) yields\n\\[S_{k,\\ell}=\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}\\Big(\\ell^{i+1}+\\frac{\\ell^{i+1}-1}{\\ell-1}\\Big)\\ +\\ \\Delta_k,\\]\nwith \u2212(k\u22121)\u2264\\Delta_k\u22640, coming from rounding and the terminal t_k=\\ell. Summing the two geometric series gives the displayed bounds. The asymptotic statement follows since \\ell^{k+1}=\\ell\\cdot\\ell^k and the prefactors depend only on \\ell.\n\nRemark (\u2113=2 sanity check). Substituting \\ell=2 yields the exact form S_{k,2}=\\sum_{i=1}^{k-1}(2^{i+2}\u22121)+2=2^{k+2}\u2212k\u22125, matching the \\Theta(2^k) behavior without a factor k.\n\nLemma 2 (Sharp ray-packing with exact constants)\n\nLet B\u2245B^+_{k,\\ell} with leaf set L (|L|=\\ell^k). For each w\u2208L, let S(w)\u2245S^-_{k,h} centered at w. If\n\\[h\\ \\ge\\ (|V(B)|\u22121)\\ +\\ (|L|\u22121)\\cdot k\\ell\\ +\\ \\ell,\\]\nthen one can choose subspiders S\u2032(w)\u2286S(w), each isomorphic to S^-_{k,\\ell}, such that the S\u2032(w) are pairwise vertex-disjoint and disjoint from B except at their centers.\n\nProof. Process w\u2208L greedily. At the time of placing S\u2032(w), the occupied vertices lie in B and in previously chosen S\u2032(\u00b7), contributing at most (|V(B)|\u22121)+m\u00b7k\\ell blocked rays of S(w) (m\u2264|L|\u22121), because each occupied vertex blocks at most one ray of S(w) and vertices outside S(w) block none. The displayed inequality guarantees \u2265\\ell free rays remain to choose S\u2032(w). Disjointness follows by construction.\n\nCorollary (plugging |V(B)| and |L|). With |V(B)|=(\\ell^{k+1}\u22121)/(\\ell\u22121) and |L|=\\ell^k, it suffices that\n\\[h\\ \\ge\\ k\\ell^{k+1}\u2212k\\ell\\ +\\ \\frac{\\ell^{k+1}\u22121}{\\ell\u22121}\\ +\\ \\ell.\\]\nThis refines previous bounds by an exact \u22121 and subsumes coarse estimates like k\\ell^{k+1}+2\\ell^k+\\ell.\n\nTheorem 3 (Outstar with \u03b4+-common leaves that are independent)\n\nStatement. Let \\ell\u22652, k\u22651, and let \\mathcal P be \u03b4+-common with threshold d(\\mathcal P). Define \\Gamma(0):={v: v satisfies \\mathcal P} and for i\u22651\n\\[\\Gamma(i):=\\{v: \\deg^+_{\\Gamma(i\u22121)\\setminus U_i}(v)\\ge t_i\\},\\]\nwhere U_i is the set of vertices already chosen up to level i\u22121, and\n\\[t_{k\u2212i}=\\ell^{i+1}+\\left\\lceil\\frac{\\ell^{i+1}\u22121}{\\ell\u22121}\\right\\rceil+\\ell^{i}\\quad(1\\le i\\le k\u22121),\\quad t_k=\\ell.\\]\nIf \\(\\delta^+(G)\\ge d(\\mathcal P)+S^{\\mathrm{ind}}_{k,\\ell}\\), where \\(S^{\\mathrm{ind}}_{k,\\ell}=\\sum_{i=1}^k t_i\\), then G contains B\u2245B^+_{k,\\ell} whose leaves all satisfy \\(\\mathcal P\\) and form an independent set (no edges between distinct leaves).\n\nWhy useful. Independence of leaves reduces potential interference when attaching in-spiders at leaves, as no leaf lies on a ray (of length 1) of another\u2019s S(w).\n\nProof (sketch with auditable modifications). The lexicographic partition proof of \\(\\Gamma(k)\\neq\\emptyset\\) proceeds exactly as in the paper, with thresholds t_i. Build B_i from v\u2208\\Gamma(k) greedily by levels. At stage i, the leaf set L has size |L|=\\ell^i and lies in \\Gamma(k\u2212i). For each w\u2208L, we must forbid both (a) the already-used vertices (|V(B_i)| many) and (b) potential collisions at level i+1 that would create edges among distinct new leaves. For (b), for each previously chosen child u of any leaf (there are at most |L|\u00b7\\ell=\\ell^{i+1} such vertices), forbid the in/out-neighbours that would create an edge involving u as a leaf; this costs at most \\ell^{i+1} extra forbidden vertices per w, and hence adding the \\(\\ell^{i}\\) term inside t_{k\u2212i} suffices after accounting for disjointness across |L| leaves. With these augmentations, each w still has \u2265\\ell^{i+1} available neighbours in \\Gamma(k\u2212i\u22121)\\setminus U_i, and the same greedy packing used in the paper assigns disjoint \\ell-sets to all w, yielding B_{i+1} with leaves independent. After k steps, leaves lie in \\Gamma(0) and satisfy \\(\\mathcal P\\).\n\nQuantitative bound. Summing the additional \\(\\ell^i\\) term yields an extra \\(\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}\\ell^i=(\\ell^k\u22121)/(\\ell\u22121)=\\Theta_\\ell(\\ell^k)\\). Thus \\(S^{\\mathrm{ind}}_{k,\\ell}=S_{k,\\ell}+\\Theta_\\ell(\\ell^k)\\), preserving the \u201cno factor k\u201d feature.\n\nProposition 4 (k=2 spiders; matching-based bound with subtraction correction)\n\nLet \\(\\delta^+(G)=d\\) and partition \\(V=A\\cup B\\) where \\(A=\\{v: \\deg^\u2212(v)\\ge 2\\ell\\}\\), \\(B=V\\setminus A\\). If some r\u2208A has \\(\\deg^-_A(r)\\ge 2\\ell\\), a greedy construction gives \\(S^-_{2,\\ell}\\). Else \\(\\deg^-_A(\\cdot)\\le 2\\ell\u22121\\) on A. Then there exists \\(a\\in A\\) with \\(T:=|V\\to B\\to\\{a\\}|\\ge d(d\u22122\\ell)\\). Let \\(Y=N^-_B(a)\\) and form the bipartite H with parts \\(U=V\\setminus\\{a\\}, Y\\) and edges \\(q\\to b\\) (q\u2208U, b\u2208Y). Let s be a maximum matching size in H. Then\n\\[s\\ \\ge\\ \\frac{d(d\u22122\\ell)\u2212\\deg^+_Y(a)}{\\,d+2\\ell\u22121\\,}\\ \\ge\\ \\frac{d(d\u22122\\ell+1)}{\\,d+2\\ell\u22121\\,}\u22121.\\]\nIn particular, \\(s\\ge \\ell\\) (hence \\(S^-_{2,\\ell}\\subseteq G\\)) holds whenever \\(d>\\frac{(3\\ell\u22121)+\\sqrt{17\\ell^2\u221210\\ell+1}}{2}\\).\n\nProof. The lower bound on T is as in the paper. Passing to H removes at most \\(\\deg^+_Y(a)\\le 2\\ell\u22121\\) 2-walks (those with q=a). Thus \\(|E(H)|\\ge d(d\u22122\\ell)\u2212\\deg^+_Y(a)\\). For the upper bound, let M be a maximum matching covering Q\u2286U and S\u2286Y with |Q|=|S|=s; maximality gives no edges between \\(U\\setminus Q\\) and \\(Y\\setminus S\\). Hence\n\\[|E(H)|\\le \\sum_{q\\in Q}\\deg^+(q)+\\sum_{b\\in S}\\deg^\u2212(b)\\le sd+(2\\ell\u22121)s=s(d+2\\ell\u22121).\\]\nCombining the bounds yields the first inequality, which implies the stated threshold after solving \\(s\\ge\\ell\\). Numerics (sanity): for \\(\\ell=2\\), the bound gives \\(d\\ge \\lceil (5+\\sqrt{33})/2\\rceil=\\lceil 5.372\u2026\\rceil=6\\) (the quadratic\u2019s continuous root), and the exact integer threshold from the inequality is 7; for \\(\\ell=3\\), it gives \\(d\\ge \\lceil (8+\\sqrt{88})/2\\rceil=\\lceil 8.690\u2026\\rceil=9\\), consistent with the asymptotic \\(((3+\\sqrt{17})/2)\\ell\\).\n\nObstacles\n\n- The lexicographic partition method necessarily sums level thresholds; any per-level guarantee of \\(\\ell^{i+1}\\) available children forces \\(\\sum_i \\ell^{i+1}=\\Theta_\\ell(\\ell^k)\\). Further constant shaving likely requires a global (semi-random) selection.\n- The greedy ray-packing analysis is tight up to \u00b11 under \u201cone-vertex blocks at most one ray\u201d counting. Larger gains appear to require global (hypergraph) matching tools.\n\nNext steps\n\n- Pursue a semi-random nibble to reduce the per-level overhead from \\(|V(B_i)|\\) toward \\((1+o(1))\\ell^{i+1}\\), aiming for \\(S_{k,\\ell}=(1+o(1))C(\\ell)\\,\\ell^k\\).\n- Globalize ray packing via hypergraph matchings (e.g., Pippenger\u2013Spencer) to bring \\(h\\) down to \\((1+o(1))k\\ell^{k+1}\\).\n- Seek improved (polynomial-in-h) bounds for \\(f(k,h)\\) (Aboulker et al.) for fixed k, so that structural improvements translate to substantially smaller \u03b4^+ thresholds for \\(T(k,\\ell)\\).\n\nWhy useful here\n\n- Lemma 1 gives exact constants for S_{k,\\ell}, enabling precise \u03b4^+ thresholds in corollaries and comparisons.\n- Lemma 2\u2019s exact bound tightens the h requirement used to attach in-spiders, improving Theorem 3.6\u2019s quantitative form.\n- Theorem 3 equips the skeleton B with independent leaves, a structural feature that can facilitate later packings of \\(S^-_{k,\\ell}\\) and reduce interference.\n- Proposition 4 consolidates the corrected matching-based k=2 analysis with explicit inequalities that are straightforward to verify and to plug into finite-\u2113 numerics.
