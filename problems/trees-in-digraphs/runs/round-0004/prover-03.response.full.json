Process w\u2208L greedily. At the time of placing S\u2032(w), the occupied vertices lie in B and in previously chosen S\u2032(\u00b7), contributing at most (|V(B)|\u22121)+m\u00b7k\\\\ell blocked rays of S(w) (m\u2264|L|\u22121), because each occupied vertex blocks at most one ray of S(w) and vertices outside S(w) block none.

Independence of leaves reduces potential interference when attaching in-spiders at leaves, as no leaf lies on a ray (of length 1) of another\u2019s S(w).\\n\\nProof (sketch with auditable modifications). The lexicographic partition proof of \\\\(\\\\Gamma(k)\\\\neq\\\\emptyset\\\\) proceeds exactly as in the paper, with thresholds t_i. Build B_i from v\u2208\\\\Gamma(k) greedily by levels. At stage i, the leaf set L has size |L|=\\\\ell^i and lies in \\\\Gamma(k\u2212i). For each w\u2208L, we must forbid both (a) the already-used vertices (|V(B_i)| many) and (b) potential collisions at level i+1 that would create edges among distinct new leaves. For (b), for each previously chosen child u of any leaf (there are at most |L|\u00b7\\\\ell=\\\\ell^{i+1} such vertices), forbid the in/out-neighbours that would create an edge involving u as a leaf; this costs at most \\\\ell^{i+1} extra forbidden vertices per w, and hence adding the \\\\(\\\\ell^{i}\\\\) term inside t_{k\u2212i} suffices after accounting for disjointness across |L| leaves. With these augmentations, each w still has \u2265\\\\ell^{i+1} available neighbours in \\\\Gamma(k\u2212i\u22121)\\\\setminus U_i, and the same greedy packing used in the paper assigns disjoint \\\\ell-sets to all w, yielding B_{i+1} with leaves independent. After k steps, leaves lie in \\\\Gamma(0) and satisfy \\\\(\\\\mathcal P\\\\).\\n\\nQuantitative bound. Summing the additional \\\\(\\\\ell^i\\\\) term yields an extra \\\\(\\\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}\\\\ell^i=(\\\\ell^k\u22121)/(\\\\ell\u22121)=\\\\Theta_\\\\ell(\\\\ell^k)\\\\). Thus \\\\(S^{\\\\mathrm{ind}}_{k,\\\\ell}=S_{k,\\\\ell}+\\\\Theta_\\\\ell(\\\\ell^k)\\\\), preserving the \u201cno factor k\u201d feature.\\n\\nProposition 4 (k=2 spiders; matching-based bound with subtraction correction)\\n\\nLet \\\\(\\\\delta^+(G)=d\\\\) and partition \\\\(V=A\\\\cup B\\\\) where \\\\(A=\\\\{v: \\\\deg^\u2212(v)\\\\ge 2\\\\ell\\\\}\\\\), \\\\(B=V\\\\setminus A\\\\).

The lower bound on T is as in the paper. Passing to H removes at most \\\\(\\\\deg^+_Y(a)\\\\le 2\\\\ell\u22121\\\\) 2-walks (those with q=a). Thus \\\\(|E(H)|\\\\ge d(d\u22122\\\\ell)\u2212\\\\deg^+_Y(a)\\\\). For the upper bound, let M be a maximum matching covering Q\u2286U and S\u2286Y with |Q|=|S|=s; maximality gives no edges between \\\\(U\\\\setminus Q\\\\) and \\\\(Y\\\\setminus S\\\\). Hence\\n\\\\[|E(H)|\\\\le \\\\sum_{q\\\\in Q}\\\\deg^+(q)+\\\\sum_{b\\\\in S}\\\\deg^\u2212(b)\\\\le sd+(2\\\\ell\u22121)s=s(d+2\\\\ell\u22121).\\\\]\\nCombining the bounds yields the first inequality, which implies the stated threshold after solving \\\\(s\\\\ge\\\\ell\\\\). Numerics (sanity): for \\\\(\\\\ell=2\\\\), the bound gives \\\\(d\\\\ge \\\\lceil (5+\\\\sqrt{33})/2\\\\rceil=\\\\lceil 5.372\u2026\\\\rceil=6\\\\) (the quadratic\u2019s continuous root), and the exact integer threshold from the inequality is 7; for \\\\(\\\\ell=3\\\\), it gives \\\\(d\\\\ge \\\\lceil (8+\\\\sqrt{88})/2\\\\rceil=\\\\lceil 8.690\u2026\\\\rceil=9\\\\), consistent with the asymptotic \\\\(((3+\\\\sqrt{17})/2)\\\\ell\\\\).\\n\\nObstacles\\n\\n- The lexicographic partition method necessarily sums level thresholds; any per-level guarantee of \\\\(\\\\ell^{i+1}\\\\) available children forces \\\\(\\\\sum_i \\\\ell^{i+1}=\\\\Theta_\\\\ell(\\\\ell^k)\\\\). Further constant shaving likely requires a global (semi-random) selection.\\n- The greedy ray-packing analysis is tight up to \u00b11 under \u201cone-vertex blocks at most one ray\u201d counting.
