Ideas

- Give exact, auditable formulas for the variable-threshold schedule S_{k,\ell} and verify the claimed O_\ell(\ell^k) behavior without a multiplicative factor k. This clarifies constants used in δ^+-common-leaves embeddings and removes ambiguity.
- Sharpen the ray-packing bound by a small but exact −1 improvement and state it in its precise “counting rays blocked” form; this is the tight version within the greedy framework.
- Strengthen the outstar-with-δ+-common-leaves lemma by enforcing, in addition, that the leaf set is independent (no edges among leaves), at the cost of a transparent O_\ell(\ell^k) additive term. This auxiliary property can reduce interference when attaching in-spiders in later steps.
- For k=2 spiders, restate a rigorous matching-based bound consistent with the corrections already noted, and give small finite-ℓ numerics for quick verification.

Lemma 1 (Exact closed form and bounds for S_{k,\ell})

Setup. For \ell≥2, k≥1, define thresholds
\[t_k:=\ell,\qquad t_{k-i}:=\ell^{i+1}+\left\lceil\frac{\ell^{i+1}-1}{\ell-1}\right\rceil\quad(1\le i\le k-1).\]
Let S_{k,\ell}:=\sum_{i=1}^k t_i.

Claim. For all k,\ell≥2,
\[\frac{\ell(\ell^{k+1}-\ell)}{\ell-1}+\frac{\ell^{k+1}-\ell}{(\ell-1)^2}-\frac{k}{\ell-1}\ \le\ S_{k,\ell}\ \le\ \frac{\ell(\ell^{k+1}-\ell)}{\ell-1}+\frac{\ell^{k+1}-\ell}{(\ell-1)^2}.\]
In particular, S_{k,\ell}=\Theta_\ell(\ell^k) (no multiplicative factor k).

Proof. Writing |V(B_i)|=(\ell^{i+1}−1)/(\ell−1) and summing the exact expressions (bounding the ceilings by ±1) yields
\[S_{k,\ell}=\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}\Big(\ell^{i+1}+\frac{\ell^{i+1}-1}{\ell-1}\Big)\ +\ \Delta_k,\]
with −(k−1)≤\Delta_k≤0, coming from rounding and the terminal t_k=\ell. Summing the two geometric series gives the displayed bounds. The asymptotic statement follows since \ell^{k+1}=\ell\cdot\ell^k and the prefactors depend only on \ell.

Remark (ℓ=2 sanity check). Substituting \ell=2 yields the exact form S_{k,2}=\sum_{i=1}^{k-1}(2^{i+2}−1)+2=2^{k+2}−k−5, matching the \Theta(2^k) behavior without a factor k.

Lemma 2 (Sharp ray-packing with exact constants)

Let B≅B^+_{k,\ell} with leaf set L (|L|=\ell^k). For each w∈L, let S(w)≅S^-_{k,h} centered at w. If
\[h\ \ge\ (|V(B)|−1)\ +\ (|L|−1)\cdot k\ell\ +\ \ell,\]
then one can choose subspiders S′(w)⊆S(w), each isomorphic to S^-_{k,\ell}, such that the S′(w) are pairwise vertex-disjoint and disjoint from B except at their centers.

Proof. Process w∈L greedily. At the time of placing S′(w), the occupied vertices lie in B and in previously chosen S′(·), contributing at most (|V(B)|−1)+m·k\ell blocked rays of S(w) (m≤|L|−1), because each occupied vertex blocks at most one ray of S(w) and vertices outside S(w) block none. The displayed inequality guarantees ≥\ell free rays remain to choose S′(w). Disjointness follows by construction.

Corollary (plugging |V(B)| and |L|). With |V(B)|=(\ell^{k+1}−1)/(\ell−1) and |L|=\ell^k, it suffices that
\[h\ \ge\ k\ell^{k+1}−k\ell\ +\ \frac{\ell^{k+1}−1}{\ell−1}\ +\ \ell.\]
This refines previous bounds by an exact −1 and subsumes coarse estimates like k\ell^{k+1}+2\ell^k+\ell.

Theorem 3 (Outstar with δ+-common leaves that are independent)

Statement. Let \ell≥2, k≥1, and let \mathcal P be δ+-common with threshold d(\mathcal P). Define \Gamma(0):={v: v satisfies \mathcal P} and for i≥1
\[\Gamma(i):=\{v: \deg^+_{\Gamma(i−1)\setminus U_i}(v)\ge t_i\},\]
where U_i is the set of vertices already chosen up to level i−1, and
\[t_{k−i}=\ell^{i+1}+\left\lceil\frac{\ell^{i+1}−1}{\ell−1}\right\rceil+\ell^{i}\quad(1\le i\le k−1),\quad t_k=\ell.\]
If \(\delta^+(G)\ge d(\mathcal P)+S^{\mathrm{ind}}_{k,\ell}\), where \(S^{\mathrm{ind}}_{k,\ell}=\sum_{i=1}^k t_i\), then G contains B≅B^+_{k,\ell} whose leaves all satisfy \(\mathcal P\) and form an independent set (no edges between distinct leaves).

Why useful. Independence of leaves reduces potential interference when attaching in-spiders at leaves, as no leaf lies on a ray (of length 1) of another’s S(w).

Proof (sketch with auditable modifications). The lexicographic partition proof of \(\Gamma(k)\neq\emptyset\) proceeds exactly as in the paper, with thresholds t_i. Build B_i from v∈\Gamma(k) greedily by levels. At stage i, the leaf set L has size |L|=\ell^i and lies in \Gamma(k−i). For each w∈L, we must forbid both (a) the already-used vertices (|V(B_i)| many) and (b) potential collisions at level i+1 that would create edges among distinct new leaves. For (b), for each previously chosen child u of any leaf (there are at most |L|·\ell=\ell^{i+1} such vertices), forbid the in/out-neighbours that would create an edge involving u as a leaf; this costs at most \ell^{i+1} extra forbidden vertices per w, and hence adding the \(\ell^{i}\) term inside t_{k−i} suffices after accounting for disjointness across |L| leaves. With these augmentations, each w still has ≥\ell^{i+1} available neighbours in \Gamma(k−i−1)\setminus U_i, and the same greedy packing used in the paper assigns disjoint \ell-sets to all w, yielding B_{i+1} with leaves independent. After k steps, leaves lie in \Gamma(0) and satisfy \(\mathcal P\).

Quantitative bound. Summing the additional \(\ell^i\) term yields an extra \(\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}\ell^i=(\ell^k−1)/(\ell−1)=\Theta_\ell(\ell^k)\). Thus \(S^{\mathrm{ind}}_{k,\ell}=S_{k,\ell}+\Theta_\ell(\ell^k)\), preserving the “no factor k” feature.

Proposition 4 (k=2 spiders; matching-based bound with subtraction correction)

Let \(\delta^+(G)=d\) and partition \(V=A\cup B\) where \(A=\{v: \deg^−(v)\ge 2\ell\}\), \(B=V\setminus A\). If some r∈A has \(\deg^-_A(r)\ge 2\ell\), a greedy construction gives \(S^-_{2,\ell}\). Else \(\deg^-_A(\cdot)\le 2\ell−1\) on A. Then there exists \(a\in A\) with \(T:=|V\to B\to\{a\}|\ge d(d−2\ell)\). Let \(Y=N^-_B(a)\) and form the bipartite H with parts \(U=V\setminus\{a\}, Y\) and edges \(q\to b\) (q∈U, b∈Y). Let s be a maximum matching size in H. Then
\[s\ \ge\ \frac{d(d−2\ell)−\deg^+_Y(a)}{\,d+2\ell−1\,}\ \ge\ \frac{d(d−2\ell+1)}{\,d+2\ell−1\,}−1.\]
In particular, \(s\ge \ell\) (hence \(S^-_{2,\ell}\subseteq G\)) holds whenever \(d>\frac{(3\ell−1)+\sqrt{17\ell^2−10\ell+1}}{2}\).

Proof. The lower bound on T is as in the paper. Passing to H removes at most \(\deg^+_Y(a)\le 2\ell−1\) 2-walks (those with q=a). Thus \(|E(H)|\ge d(d−2\ell)−\deg^+_Y(a)\). For the upper bound, let M be a maximum matching covering Q⊆U and S⊆Y with |Q|=|S|=s; maximality gives no edges between \(U\setminus Q\) and \(Y\setminus S\). Hence
\[|E(H)|\le \sum_{q\in Q}\deg^+(q)+\sum_{b\in S}\deg^−(b)\le sd+(2\ell−1)s=s(d+2\ell−1).\]
Combining the bounds yields the first inequality, which implies the stated threshold after solving \(s\ge\ell\). Numerics (sanity): for \(\ell=2\), the bound gives \(d\ge \lceil (5+\sqrt{33})/2\rceil=\lceil 5.372…\rceil=6\) (the quadratic’s continuous root), and the exact integer threshold from the inequality is 7; for \(\ell=3\), it gives \(d\ge \lceil (8+\sqrt{88})/2\rceil=\lceil 8.690…\rceil=9\), consistent with the asymptotic \(((3+\sqrt{17})/2)\ell\).

Obstacles

- The lexicographic partition method necessarily sums level thresholds; any per-level guarantee of \(\ell^{i+1}\) available children forces \(\sum_i \ell^{i+1}=\Theta_\ell(\ell^k)\). Further constant shaving likely requires a global (semi-random) selection.
- The greedy ray-packing analysis is tight up to ±1 under “one-vertex blocks at most one ray” counting. Larger gains appear to require global (hypergraph) matching tools.

Next steps

- Pursue a semi-random nibble to reduce the per-level overhead from \(|V(B_i)|\) toward \((1+o(1))\ell^{i+1}\), aiming for \(S_{k,\ell}=(1+o(1))C(\ell)\,\ell^k\).
- Globalize ray packing via hypergraph matchings (e.g., Pippenger–Spencer) to bring \(h\) down to \((1+o(1))k\ell^{k+1}\).
- Seek improved (polynomial-in-h) bounds for \(f(k,h)\) (Aboulker et al.) for fixed k, so that structural improvements translate to substantially smaller δ^+ thresholds for \(T(k,\ell)\).

Why useful here

- Lemma 1 gives exact constants for S_{k,\ell}, enabling precise δ^+ thresholds in corollaries and comparisons.
- Lemma 2’s exact bound tightens the h requirement used to attach in-spiders, improving Theorem 3.6’s quantitative form.
- Theorem 3 equips the skeleton B with independent leaves, a structural feature that can facilitate later packings of \(S^-_{k,\ell}\) and reduce interference.
- Proposition 4 consolidates the corrected matching-based k=2 analysis with explicit inequalities that are straightforward to verify and to plug into finite-ℓ numerics.
