Ideas

- Correct the explicit bound for the level-dependent threshold sum S_{k,ℓ}. Provide exact expressions (and a clean ℓ=2 closed form), fixing a factor-ℓ slip in the notes and making constants auditable.
- Robust δ+-commonness with forbidden sets. Formalize a small lemma: if a property is δ+-common at threshold f, then the property “avoiding a fixed forbidden set F” is δ+-common with threshold f+|F|. This integrates neatly into the Γ-layer argument and justifies the ray-packing bounds with precise h.
- Parameterized A/B-threshold in the k=2 spider proof. Generalize the 2-walk/matching proof to a parameter t≥2ℓ and optimize over t; verify that t=2ℓ is optimal within this method, hence constants used are essentially best possible for this template.

Corrections and refined bounds

1) Exact/good bounds for S_{k,ℓ}

Recall the schedule t_k=ℓ and, for j=1,…,k−1, t_{k−j}=ℓ^{j+1}+⌈(ℓ^{j+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉. Then

S_{k,ℓ}=∑_{i=1}^k t_i = ℓ + ∑_{j=1}^{k−1} ℓ^{j+1} + ∑_{j=1}^{k−1} ⌈(ℓ^{j+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉.

Bounding the ceiling by +1 gives

S_{k,ℓ} ≤ ℓ + (ℓ(ℓ^k−ℓ))/(ℓ−1) + (ℓ(ℓ^k−ℓ))/(ℓ−1)^2 + (k−1).

Equivalently,

S_{k,ℓ} ≤ (ℓ^2/(ℓ−1)^2)·ℓ^k − (ℓ^2/(ℓ−1)^2)·ℓ + ℓ + (k−1) = (ℓ^2/(ℓ−1)^2)·ℓ^k + O_ℓ(1) + O(k).

In particular, S_{k,ℓ}=Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k) (no multiplicative factor k). The earlier displayed bound S_{k,ℓ} ≤ ℓ(ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ)/(ℓ−1)^2 + O(k) is off by a factor of ℓ.

Explicit ℓ=2 closed form. For ℓ=2, t_{k−j}=2^{j+2}−1 and t_k=2. Hence

S_{k,2} = 2 + ∑_{j=1}^{k−1} (2^{j+2}−1) = 2 + (2^{k+2}−8) − (k−1) = 4·2^k − k − 5.

This corrects the claim S_{k,2}=4·2^k−4−k by 1.

2) Robust δ+-commonness with forbidden sets

Lemma (robust δ+-commonness). Let P be δ+-common with threshold d(P). For a fixed forbidden set F⊆V(G), define P_F(v) := “v satisfies P in G−F.” Then P_F is δ+-common with threshold d(P)+|F|, and P_F implies P.

Proof. If δ^+(G) ≥ d(P)+|F|, then δ^+(G−F) ≥ d(P). Hence G−F contains a vertex v with P in G−F; since P is anti-monotone (upward closed under supergraphs), v satisfies P in G as well. Thus P_F is δ+-common with threshold d(P)+|F|, and P_F⇒P. ∎

Usefulness. In the Γ-layer construction with variable thresholds, one can interpret “leaf has property center-of S^-_{k,h} avoiding B∪picked rays” by applying the lemma with |F| bounded during the greedy steps. This justifies the refined h bound precisely via Proposition B’s accounting of |F|.

3) k=2 spiders with a parameterized A/B-threshold

Let t≥2ℓ be a parameter and define A={v: deg^−(v)≥t}, B=V\A. Assume deg^+≡d. If there exists r∈A with deg^−_A(r)≥ℓ, then the greedy construction succeeds since every a∈A has deg^−(a)≥t≥2ℓ (enabling distinct x_i). Otherwise deg^−_A(·)≤t−1 on A.

Counting 2-walks as in the paper (using d(d−1) and (d−1) instead of d^2, d), we obtain

|A→V→V| ≥ |A|·d(d−1),
|A→A→V| ≤ e(G[A])·d ≤ (t−1)d|A|,
|B→B→V| = e(G[B])·d,
|V→B→B| ≤ (t−1)e(G[B]).

Thus |V→B→A| ≥ |A|·d(d−t) and there is a∈A with |V→B→{a}| ≥ d(d−t). Consider the predecessor bipartite graph H between L:=V\{a} and R:=N^-_B(a), with edges (q,b) for (q,b)∈E(G). Let M be a maximum matching with matched sets Q⊆L, S⊆R (|S|=|Q|=:s). As in the repaired proof, every b∈R\S has N_H(b)⊆Q, hence

|V→S→{a}| ≤ (t−1)s,  |V→(R\S)→{a}| ≤ e(Q,R\S) ≤ ∑_{q∈Q} deg^+(q) = d s.

Moreover, |E(H)| = |V→B→{a}| − deg^+_B(a) ≥ d(d−t) − d. Therefore

(d(d−t) − d) ≤ |E(H)| ≤ (d + t − 1) s,

so

s ≥ (d(d−t) − d)/(d + t − 1).

To force s>ℓ, it suffices that d satisfies

d(d−t) − d > ℓ(d + t − 1)  ⇔  d^2 − (t+ℓ+1)d − ℓ t + ℓ > 0.

Asymptotics for d=cℓ and t=aℓ (a≥2) give c minimal satisfying c^2 − (a+1)c − a ≥ 0, i.e.

c ≥ [(a+1) + √(a^2+6a+1)]/2.

This is minimized at a=2 (monotone increasing for a≥2), yielding c ≥ ((3)+√17)/2, which coincides with the paper’s asymptotic constant. Hence, within this 2-walk/matching template, choosing t=2ℓ is optimal.

Conclusion. The parameterized analysis confirms that the (3+√17)/2 constant is essentially best possible for this method; improvements require genuinely new ideas.

Examples

- For ℓ=2, the corrected S_{k,2}=4·2^k − k − 5 concretely calibrates the additive term in the Γ-layer theorem; this is roughly half the paper’s 2k·2^k for large k.
- The robust δ+-commonness lemma lets one restate the ray-packing step as a single invocation with forbidden set size |F| ≤ |V(B)| + kℓ(|L|−1), recovering the exact h bound h ≥ |V(B)| + kℓ|L| + ℓ.

Obstacles

- Achieving S_{k,ℓ}=(1+o(1))·C(ℓ)·ℓ^k (removing the O(k) addend and tightening the leading constant) seems to require a global b-matching/nibble across leaves at each depth, beyond what local degree thresholds guarantee.
- For k=2, the 2-walk/matching scheme seems tight after the +d correction; further progress likely demands a different decomposition or an inequality exploiting additional structure (e.g., bounds on co-degrees or expansion in B).

Next steps

- Develop a per-level global b-matching (Hall-type) condition using lower bounds on deg into Γ-sets and upper bounds on co-degrees to reduce the additive threshold toward (1+o(1))ℓ^{i+1} at each depth.
- Globalize ray packing: model the rays as a set system and apply a hypergraph matching (e.g., Pippenger–Spencer nibble) to allocate ℓ rays per center simultaneously, targeting h=(1+o(1))kℓ^{k+1}.
- Investigate improved bounds on f(k,h) for S^-_{k,h} (even polynomial in h for fixed k), to translate the structural improvements into substantially smaller δ^+-thresholds.

Summary of auditable advances

- Corrected and quantified S_{k,ℓ} with explicit constants; provided a closed form for ℓ=2.
- Proved a robust δ+-commonness lemma with forbidden sets, justifying the refined h in the T(k,ℓ) construction.
- Generalized the k=2 spider proof to a threshold parameter t, and showed t=2ℓ is optimal for the 2-walk/matching method, explaining current constant barriers.
