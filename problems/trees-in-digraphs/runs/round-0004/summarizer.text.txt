{"summary_md":"Refinements and corrections to the paper's constructions and constants. A level-dependent threshold schedule t_{k-i}=ℓ^{i+1}+⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉ yields S_{k,ℓ}=∑ t_i = Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k) with explicit bound S_{k,ℓ} ≤ ℓ(ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ)/(ℓ−1)^2 + ((ℓ−2)/(ℓ−1))k (exact ℓ=2: S_{k,2}=4·2^k−k−5). The greedy ray-packing threshold is sharpened to h ≥ (|V(B)|−1)+(|L|−1)·kℓ+ℓ, which for B≅B^+_{k,ℓ} gives h ≥ kℓ^{k+1}−kℓ+(ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)+ℓ (improves prior bounds and is essentially tight for the greedy method). The k=2 argument is repaired: counting 2-walks plus a maximum-matching yields s ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1)/(d+2ℓ−1) and threshold d_*(ℓ)=((3ℓ−1)+√(17ℓ^2−10ℓ+1))/2, fixing a gap. Next work: global matching/nibble and better f(k,h) bounds.
