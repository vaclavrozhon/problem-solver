The variable-threshold outstar-with-δ+-common-leaves scheme is now fully rigorous. The Γ-levels with thresholds t_{k−i}=ℓ^{i+1}+⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉ and base t_k=ℓ give S_{k,ℓ}=∑ t_i=Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k) without the linear-in-k loss. Both the lexicographic partition step and the depth-greedy extension are correct. Please standardize on the exact ℓ=2 closed form S_{k,2}=4·2^k−k−5 (Prover 2’s correction); earlier “−4−k” was off by 1. The general bound S_{k,ℓ} ≤ (ℓ^2/(ℓ−1)^2)·ℓ^k + O(ℓ^k)+O(k) is consistent across submissions.

Ray packing: the precise, tight greedy bound is h ≥ (|V(B)|−1) + (|L|−1)·kℓ + ℓ with |V(B)|=(ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1), |L|=ℓ^k. This improves the already refined kℓ^{k+1} + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ by an additive kℓ; the “−1” at |V(B)| is also exact (w is in U but lies on all rays and should not be counted). This is the best possible within the one-by-one greedy framework. Prover 4’s “robust δ+-commonness with forbidden sets” lemma is valid and can be used to phrase this step formally.

k=2 spiders: the matching-based repair must subtract the contribution of 2-walks starting at a, i.e., deg^+_B(a)≤d, when passing from |V→B→{a}| to |E(H)|. The resulting rigorous lower bound is s ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1)/(d+2ℓ−1) (or a close (d−1)-variant), yielding δ^+ > ((3ℓ−1)+√(17ℓ^2−10ℓ+1))/2. Any claim approaching ≈3ℓ or (1+√3)ℓ omits this necessary correction and is not justified.

Triage: Keep (i) the variable-threshold theorem with the corrected S_{k,2} formula and sharp constants, (ii) the exact ray-packing bound with (|V(B)|−1)+(|L|−1)kℓ+ℓ, and (iii) the k=2 threshold δ^+ > ((3ℓ−1)+√(17ℓ^2−10ℓ+1))/2. De-emphasize the stronger k=2 claims that miss the +d term and the “independent leaves” variant unless its extra budget is tightly justified.

Next steps: (1) Develop a per-depth global b-matching/nibble to reduce the |V(B_i)| overhead toward (1+o(1))ℓ^{i+1}, aiming for S_{k,ℓ}=(1+o(1))·C(ℓ)·ℓ^k. (2) Globalize ray packing via hypergraph matching/flow to target h=(1+o(1))kℓ^{k+1}. (3) Seek polynomial-in-h bounds for f(k,h) (k fixed) to convert structural improvements into substantially smaller δ^+ thresholds.
