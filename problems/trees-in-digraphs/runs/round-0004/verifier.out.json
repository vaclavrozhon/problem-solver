  "feedback_md": "The variable-threshold outstar-with-\u03b4+-common-leaves scheme is now fully rigorous.

Both the lexicographic partition step and the depth-greedy extension are correct. Please standardize on the exact \u2113=2 closed form S_{k,2}=4\u00b72^k\u2212k\u22125 (Prover 2\u2019s correction); earlier \u201c\u22124\u2212k\u201d was off by 1. The general bound S_{k,\u2113} \u2264 (\u2113^2/(\u2113\u22121)^2)\u00b7\u2113^k + O(\u2113^k)+O(k) is consistent across submissions.\n\nRay packing: the precise, tight greedy bound is h \u2265 (|V(B)|\u22121) + (|L|\u22121)\u00b7k\u2113 + \u2113 with |V(B)|=(\u2113^{k+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121), |L|=\u2113^k. This improves the already refined k\u2113^{k+1} + (\u2113^{k+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121) + \u2113 by an additive k\u2113; the \u201c\u22121\u201d at |V(B)| is also exact (w is in U but lies on all rays and should not be counted). This is the best possible within the one-by-one greedy framework. Prover 4\u2019s \u201crobust \u03b4+-commonness with forbidden sets\u201d lemma is valid and can be used to phrase this step formally.\n\nk=2 spiders: the matching-based repair must subtract the contribution of 2-walks starting at a, i.e., deg^+_B(a)\u2264d, when passing from |V\u2192B\u2192{a}| to |E(H)|. The resulting rigorous lower bound is s \u2265 d(d\u22122\u2113+1)/(d+2\u2113\u22121) (or a close (d\u22121)-variant), yielding \u03b4^+ > ((3\u2113\u22121)+\u221a(17\u2113^2\u221210\u2113+1))/2. Any claim approaching \u22483\u2113 or (1+\u221a3)\u2113 omits this necessary correction and is not justified.\n\nTriage: Keep (i) the variable-threshold theorem with the corrected S_{k,2} formula and sharp constants, (ii) the exact ray-packing bound with (|V(B)|\u22121)+(|L|\u22121)k\u2113+\u2113, and (iii) the k=2 threshold \u03b4^+ > ((3\u2113\u22121)+\u221a(17\u2113^2\u221210\u2113+1))/2. De-emphasize the stronger k=2 claims that miss the +d term and the \u201cindependent leaves\u201d variant unless its extra budget is tightly justified.\n\nNext steps: (1) Develop a per-depth global b-matching/nibble to reduce the |V(B_i)| overhead toward (1+o(1))\u2113^{i+1}, aiming for S_{k,\u2113}=(1+o(1))\u00b7C(\u2113)\u00b7\u2113^k. (2) Globalize ray packing via hypergraph matching/flow to target h=(1+o(1))k\u2113^{k+1}. (3) Seek polynomial-in-h bounds for f(k,h) (k fixed) to convert structural improvements into substantially smaller \u03b4^+ thresholds.",
