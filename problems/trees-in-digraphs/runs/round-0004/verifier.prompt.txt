# Research Notes



Updates and insights

- Outstar-with-δ+-common-leaves: A level-dependent threshold schedule t_{k-i}=ℓ^{i+1}+⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉ yields a total additive term S_{k,ℓ}=∑_{i=1}^k t_i=Θ(ℓ^k), independent of k up to a constant depending only on ℓ. The lexicographic partition argument and greedy extension both adapt cleanly.
- Uniform vs variable thresholds: The uniform choice T*=⌈ℓ^k·ℓ/(ℓ−1)⌉ (repeated k times) also works but is weaker (cost kT*). The key sufficient condition at depth i is deg_{Γ(k−i−1)}(w) ≥ |V(B_i)|+ℓ^{i+1}, with |V(B_i)|=(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1).
- Packing rays: For attaching S^-_{k,ℓ} at each leaf, h ≥ kℓ^{k+1}+2ℓ^k+ℓ suffices: each previously used vertex blocks at most one ray in any fixed S(w), and |V(B)| ≤ (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) ≤ 2ℓ^k.
- k=2 spiders: Counting 2-walks and using a maximum matching between V\{a} and N^-_B(a) gives s ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1)/(d+2ℓ−1), implying δ^+ > ((3ℓ−1)+√(17ℓ^2−10ℓ+1))/2. This fixes a gap in the paper’s proof where a maximality implication was unjustified.

Next directions
- Attempt a global selection (matching/nibble) over all leaves to push S_{k,ℓ} to (1+o(1))ℓ^k.
- Globalize the ray packing to reduce h to (1+o(1))kℓ^{k+1}.
- Seek better bounds on f(k,h) (e.g., polynomial in h) to translate structural improvements into substantially smaller δ^+ thresholds.

Clarifications and refinements

- Variable thresholds: The schedule t_{k−i}=ℓ^{i+1}+⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉ yields S_{k,ℓ}=∑ t_i = Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k) (no linear-in-k factor). A sharper bound is
  S_{k,ℓ} ≤ ℓ(ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ)/(ℓ−1)^2 + ((ℓ−2)/(ℓ−1))k.
- Ray packing: Use the exact bound h ≥ |V(B)| + kℓ·|L| + ℓ. With |V(B)|=(ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) and |L|=ℓ^k this gives h ≥ kℓ^{k+1} + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ, improving the earlier kℓ^{k+1}+2ℓ^k+ℓ.
- k=2 correction: In the predecessor bipartite graph H (left V\{a}, right N^-_B(a)), |E(H)| = |V→B→{a}| − deg^+_B(a). Thus one must subtract ≤ d when lower-bounding |E(H)| from a 2-walk count. The valid matching bound is s ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1)/(d+2ℓ−1) (or a close (d−1)-variant), implying δ^+ > ((3ℓ−1)+√(17ℓ^2−10ℓ+1))/2. The ≈(1+√3)ℓ claim is not supported.

Targets
- Develop global (nibble/matching) selection at each depth to reduce the |V(B_i)| overhead toward (1+o(1))ℓ^{i+1} and aim for S_{k,ℓ}=(1+o(1))·C(ℓ)·ℓ^k.
- Globalize ray packing to reduce h to (1+o(1))kℓ^{k+1}.
- Improve f(k,h) (ideally polynomial in h for fixed k) to leverage these structural gains.

Corrections and confirmations

- Variable thresholds: The schedule t_{k−i}=ℓ^{i+1}+⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉ yields S_{k,ℓ}=Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k); “independent of k” here means no multiplicative k, with constants depending only on ℓ. For ℓ=2, an exact formula is S_{k,2}=4·2^k−4−k.
- Ray packing: The sharp condition is h ≥ |V(B)| + kℓ·|L| + ℓ. With |V(B)|=(ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) and |L|=ℓ^k this refines kℓ^{k+1}+2ℓ^k+ℓ to kℓ^{k+1} + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ.
- k=2 matching repair: When upper-bounding |V→B→{a}| via a maximum matching in the predecessor graph, one must account for 2-walks a→b→a with unmatched b. Equivalently, either add +deg^+_{B\S}(a)≤d in the upper bound, or subtract deg^+_B(a)≤d when passing to E(H). The resulting valid inequality is s ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1)/(d+2ℓ−1) (or a close (d−1)-variant), giving δ^+ > ((3ℓ−1)+√(17ℓ^2−10ℓ+1))/2. Claims around 3ℓ or (1+√3)ℓ omit this correction and are invalid.

Action items
- Pursue global b-matching/nibble for child selection to reduce the |V(B_i)| overhead toward o(ℓ^{i+1}).
- Globalize ray packing via flow/hypergraph matching to target h=(1+o(1))kℓ^{k+1}.
- Work toward polynomial-in-h bounds for f(k,h) (k fixed).

# Main Results

- Outstar-with-δ+-common-leaves (refined). For ℓ≥2, k≥1, and any δ+-common property P with threshold d(P), if
  δ^+(G) ≥ d(P) + S_{k,ℓ},
  where S_{k,ℓ}=∑_{i=1}^k t_i with t_k=ℓ and t_{k−i}=ℓ^{i+1}+⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉ (1≤i≤k−1), then G contains B^+_{k,ℓ} whose leaves all satisfy P. In particular, S_{k,ℓ}=Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k) (no factor k); e.g., S_{k,ℓ} ≤ ℓ(ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ)/(ℓ−1)^2 + O(k).

- Packing in-spiders at the leaves (refined h). It suffices to take
  h = kℓ^{k+1} + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ
  (improving the earlier kℓ^{k+1}+2ℓ^k+ℓ and the paper’s 3kℓ^{k+1}). Consequently, δ^+(G) ≥ f(k,h) + S_{k,ℓ} guarantees a copy of T(k,ℓ).

- k=2 Giant Spiders. Any digraph with
  δ^+ > ((3ℓ−1)+√(17ℓ^2−10ℓ+1))/2
  contains S^-_{2,ℓ}. This corrects the proof via a maximum-matching argument (accounting for 2-walks starting at a) and improves finite-ℓ constants while matching the (3+√17)/2 asymptotics.

Ideas

- Tighten and stabilize the “outstar with δ+-common leaves” theorem by giving exact level thresholds and an exact closed form for the total additive overhead S_{k,ℓ}, as well as a clean derivation that t_k=ℓ is sufficient at the base level.
- Sharpen the ray-packing bound by keeping the exact |V(B)| rather than a coarse bound and summarize the precise choice of h.
- Repair and finalize the k=2 spider bound using a maximum-matching/vertex-cover calculation that correctly subtracts the contribution of 2-walks starting at a.
- Provide a conditional b-matching improvement at each level that (under a mild codegree assumption) would reduce the additive overhead towards the “pure” ℓ^{i+1} demand, explaining what remains to be proved to remove the condition.

Refinement 1: Outstar with δ+-common leaves (variable thresholds, exact S_{k,ℓ})

Theorem A (variable thresholds, exact sum). Let Π be a δ^+-common vertex property with threshold d(Π). Fix integers ℓ ≥ 2 and k ≥ 1. Define Γ(0) = {v : v satisfies Π} and, for 1 ≤ j ≤ k,
Γ(j) = { v : deg^+_{Γ(j−1)}(v) ≥ t_j },
where for i = 0,…,k−1 we set
 t_{k−i} := ℓ^{i+1} + ⌈(ℓ^{i+1} − 1)/(ℓ − 1)⌉,
and we take t_k = ℓ (this is the i=0 instance).
If δ^+(G) ≥ d(Π) + S_{k,ℓ}, where
 S_{k,ℓ} := ∑_{j=1}^k t_j = ∑_{r=1}^k (ℓ^r + ⌈(ℓ^r − 1)/(ℓ − 1)⌉),
then G contains a copy B ≅ B^+_{k,ℓ} such that all leaves of B satisfy Π.

Proof (concise and checkable). The lexicographic partition argument of the paper (Claim 3.8) works unchanged with thresholds t_j. Assuming Γ(k)=∅, let z be the lexicographically minimal nonempty class with z_k=0, I := {i : z_{i+1}=0}, W := ⋃_{i∈I} Γ(i). For v ∈ V_z we have deg^+_W(v) < ∑_{i∈I} t_{i+1} ≤ S_{k,ℓ}. If z ≠ 0⃗, this contradicts δ^+(G) ≥ S_{k,ℓ}; if z = 0⃗, then for all v ∈ X := V \ ⋃_{j=0}^k Γ(j), deg^+_X(v) ≥ δ^+(G) − S_{k,ℓ} ≥ d(Π), producing a Π-vertex in X and contradicting anti-monotonicity. Thus Γ(k) ≠ ∅.
Let v ∈ Γ(k). Build B_i ≅ B^+_{i,ℓ} inductively with leaves L_i ⊆ Γ(k−i), |L_i|=ℓ^i, |V(B_i)|=(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1). To construct B_{i+1}, process leaves w ∈ L_i in an arbitrary order, selecting ℓ out-neighbours in Γ(k−i−1) outside V(B_i) and disjoint across different leaves. At the j-th leaf, at most |V(B_i)|+ℓ(j−1) neighbours are forbidden. Hence it suffices that every w satisfy
 deg^+_{Γ(k−i−1)}(w) ≥ |V(B_i)| + ℓ|L_i| = (ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ^{i+1} = t_{k−i}.
For i=0, this reads deg^+_{Γ(k−1)}(v) ≥ t_k = ℓ, which ensures an out-star of size ℓ rooted at v. Hence B_k exists with all its leaves in Γ(0), i.e., all leaves satisfy Π.

Exact closed form and growth of S_{k,ℓ}. Using ⌈x⌉ = x + ε_r with 0 ≤ ε_r < 1,
S_{k,ℓ} = ∑_{r=1}^k ℓ^r + ∑_{r=1}^k (ℓ^r − 1)/(ℓ−1) + ∑_{r=1}^k ε_r
= (ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ)/(ℓ−1) + (ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ)/(ℓ−1)^2 − k/(ℓ−1) + E_k,
where 0 ≤ E_k < k. In particular,
S_{k,ℓ} = (ℓ^2/(ℓ−1)^2)·ℓ^k + O_ℓ(1),
so S_{k,ℓ} = Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k) with no multiplicative factor k. For ℓ=2 we get the exact formula S_{k,2} = 4·2^k − 4 − k.

Refinement 2: Packing the in-spiders at the leaves

Lemma B (greedy ray packing with exact |V(B)|). Let B ≅ B^+_{k,ℓ} with leaves L (|L|=ℓ^k). For each w ∈ L, let S(w) ≅ S^-_{k,h} be any selected copy in G centred at w. If
 h ≥ |V(B)| + kℓ·|L| + ℓ = (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + kℓ^{k+1} + ℓ,
then one can greedily choose for every w a subcopy S′(w) ≅ S^-_{k,ℓ}, such that these S′(w) are pairwise vertex-disjoint and disjoint from B except at their centre.

Proof. Process w ∈ L in any order. Let U be the union of B and the already chosen S′. Within S(w), every vertex of U\{w} blocks at most one ray of S(w), so the number of blocked rays is at most |U|−1. Since at every step |U| ≤ |V(B)| + kℓ(|L|−1), the condition on h ensures that at least ℓ rays in S(w) remain unblocked, and we can choose S′(w).

Corollary C (refined T(k,ℓ) threshold). With h* := (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + kℓ^{k+1} + ℓ and S_{k,ℓ} from Theorem A, if δ^+(G) ≥ f(k,h*) + S_{k,ℓ}, then G contains T(k,ℓ).

Proof. Take Π = “centre of S^-_{k,h*}”. Apply Theorem A to find B with all leaves satisfying Π; then use Lemma B to attach S′(w), w ∈ L, as required.

Repair and strengthening for k=2 spiders

Theorem D (k=2, matching/vertex-cover repair). Let ℓ ≥ 1. If δ^+(G) = d > d_*(ℓ) := ((3ℓ−1) + √(17ℓ^2 − 10ℓ + 1))/2, then G contains S^-_{2,ℓ}.

Proof. As in the paper, delete edges to make deg^+(v)=d for all v. Partition V into A := {deg^− ≥ 2ℓ} and B := V\A. If some r ∈ A has deg^-_A(r) ≥ 2ℓ, greedily embed S^-_{2,ℓ}. Otherwise, deg^-_A(·) ≤ 2ℓ−1 on A. Counting directed 2-walks gives |V ⇒ B ⇒ A| ≥ |A| d(d−2ℓ+1). Pick a ∈ A with T := |V ⇒ B ⇒ {a}| ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1). Let R := N^-_B(a), U := V\{a}, and consider the bipartite predecessor graph H with parts (U,R), edges q—b iff (q,b) ∈ E. Then |E(H)| = T − deg^+_B(a) ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1) − d. By Kőnig’s theorem, if s is the maximum matching size and C a minimum vertex cover, |C|=s, we have
 |E(H)| ≤ ∑_{q∈C∩U} deg^+(q) + ∑_{b∈C∩R} deg^−(b) ≤ d|C∩U| + (2ℓ−1)|C∩R| ≤ (d + 2ℓ − 1)s.
Hence s ≥ d(d−2ℓ)/(d+2ℓ−1). If s ≥ ℓ we obtain S^-_{2,ℓ}. Solving s ≥ ℓ gives d > d_*(ℓ).

Remarks. This corrects the gap in the original argument by accounting for 2-walks starting at a (subtracting ≤ d). Numerically this improves finite-ℓ constants over the paper, while matching (3+√17)/2 asymptotically.

Conditional improvement via global b-matching (next-step scaffold)

Statement (conditional b-matching lemma at depth i). Consider the bipartite graph H_i between L_i (|L_i|=ℓ^i) and R_i := Γ(k−i−1). Suppose
- every w ∈ L_i has deg_{H_i}(w) ≥ D_i,
- every v ∈ R_i has degree at most Δ_i (a codegree/capacity control),
- H_i has maximum codegree among distinct w,w′ on R_i bounded by λ_i ≪ D_i.
Then for D_i ≳ ℓ·(1+ε) and λ_i ≪ D_i one can (by the Rödl nibble/Pippenger–Spencer method for near-regular bipartite graphs) find a b-matching that assigns to each w ∈ L_i exactly ℓ distinct neighbours in R_i, pairwise disjoint across L_i.

Consequence (conditional threshold). Under the above, it suffices to require
 D_i ≥ ℓ + c√(ℓ log |L_i|) + O(λ_i),
for an absolute constant c, up to polylog factors, rather than D_i ≥ |V(B_i)| + ℓ|L_i| from the greedy method. Summed over i, this would reduce S_{k,ℓ} from Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k) with a nontrivial constant to (1+o(1))·ℓ^k in the regime where λ_i = o(ℓ^{i+1}).

Why this is useful. It gives a concrete pathway to push S_{k,ℓ} towards the information-theoretic lower bound ℓ^{k} (since |L_i|=ℓ^i and each leaf requires ℓ children) in graphs where the Γ-structure does not concentrate too heavily (small codegrees). The current δ^+-only hypothesis does not itself control λ_i; identifying structural consequences of large minimum out-degree that bound λ_i (even weakly) would unlock unconditional improvements.

Examples and numerics

- Exact S_{k,2}. With ℓ=2 we have t_{k−i} = 2^{i+1} + (2^{i+1} − 1) = 2^{i+2} − 1, so
  S_{k,2} = ∑_{i=0}^{k−1} (2^{i+2} − 1) = 4·2^k − 4 − k.
- Refined h. For ℓ=2, h* = (2^{k+1}−1) + k·2^{k+1} + 2 = (k+1)·2^{k+1} + 1.

Obstacles

- Unconditional global b-matching: without any control on codegrees in H_i, a pathological concentration can force the greedy-sized thresholds. Thus, to proceed, we must either derive codegree bounds from the δ^+-hypothesis (e.g., via a sparse-regularization lemma inside Γ-layers) or accept conditional statements.
- Ray packing: the bound h* is tight within the greedy framework, since in the worst case almost all already chosen vertices could lie inside a given S(w), each blocking a distinct ray. Improvements likely require a global packing argument across all S(w), which again hinges on controlling overlaps (a hypergraph codegree issue).

Next steps

- Derive a “Γ-regularization” lemma: from δ^+(G) ≥ d and the anti-monotone definition of Γ, extract large subsets R_i ⊆ Γ(k−i−1) with bounded codegrees for L_i, sufficient to run a nibble. Even very weak bounds (e.g., λ_i ≤ D_i^0.9) would materially reduce S_{k,ℓ}.
- Attempt a global ray packing via flow in a layered auxiliary network whose arcs represent rays in S(w), using capacities k per leaf and 1 per internal vertex; establish sufficient Hall-type conditions.
- Investigate k=3 spiders: try to extend the matching argument to two layers B→C→a with a flow across a layered network, aiming for a provable linear threshold d > c·ℓ with c < 3.56.

# Ideas

We consolidate and sharpen three quantitative components and add small, checkable refinements useful for curating proofs and outputs.

- Exact additive term for the outstar-with-δ+-common-leaves lemma (variable thresholds), including a closed form for ℓ=2 and clean asymptotics for general ℓ.
- A slightly stronger “ray packing” height bound h for attaching in-spiders at all leaves, written in the exact |V(B)| form and compared to previous bounds.
- A fully explicit, gap-free derivation for k=2 spiders via matching, keeping the necessary “+d correction,” and a precise threshold. Also, a short note clarifying why certain stronger-looking claims fail.

# 1) Out-arborescences with δ+-common leaves: exact S_{k,ℓ}

Setup. Let P be a δ^+-common property with threshold d(P). For k≥1, ℓ≥2 define Γ(0)= {v: v satisfies P} and, for 1≤i≤k,
Γ(i) = { v: deg^+_{Γ(i−1)}(v) ≥ t_i }.
Choose thresholds
- t_k := ℓ,
- for 1≤i≤k−1, t_{k−i} := ℓ^{i+1} + ⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉.

These ensure that at depth i there are, after removing previously used vertices |V(B_i)|=(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1), still ≥ℓ^{i+1} available neighbours per leaf, which suffices for a greedy, disjoint ℓ-extension across the ℓ^i leaves.

Lemma (Level-set contradiction, variable thresholds). If δ^+(G) ≥ d(P) + ∑_{i=1}^k t_i then Γ(k)≠∅. The lexicographic partition proof from the paper applies verbatim, replacing the uniform bound by the t_i.

Greedy construction. From any v∈Γ(k), construct B_0={v} and extend B_i→B_{i+1} by assigning ℓ disjoint children in Γ(k−i−1) to each leaf of B_i, avoiding V(B_i), which is feasible since t_{k−i}−|V(B_i)| ≥ ℓ^{i+1}.

Theorem A (Refined outstar-with-δ+-common-leaves). If
δ^+(G) ≥ d(P) + S_{k,ℓ},
where S_{k,ℓ}:=∑_{i=1}^k t_i = ℓ + ∑_{i=1}^{k−1} [ℓ^{i+1} + ⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉],
then G contains a copy of B^+_{k,ℓ} whose leaves all satisfy P.

Explicit bounds and exact formula for ℓ=2.
- For general ℓ≥2:
  S_{k,ℓ} ≤ ℓ + (ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ^2)/(ℓ−1) + (ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ^2)/(ℓ−1)^2 + O(k) = (ℓ^2/(ℓ−1)^2)·ℓ^k + O(ℓ^k) + O(k).
  In particular, S_{k,ℓ} = Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k) (no multiplicative k factor).
- For ℓ=2 one can compute exactly:
  t_k=2 and t_{k−i}=2^{i+2}−1 (1≤i≤k−1). Hence
  S_{k,2} = 2 + ∑_{i=1}^{k−1}(2^{i+2}−1) = 2^{k+2} − k − 5 = 4·2^k − k − 5.
  (Note this corrects the variant “4·2^k − 4 − k”.)

# 2) Ray packing at the leaves: exact height bound

Let B≅B^+_{k,ℓ}, L its ℓ^k leaves. For each w∈L let S(w)≅S^-_{k,h} be rooted at w. When selecting disjoint S′(w)≅S^-_{k,ℓ} one-by-one, in a fixed S(w):
- The vertices of B block at most |V(B)|−1 rays; here |V(B)|=(ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1).
- The previously selected S′(w′) over at most ℓ^k−1 leaves block ≤ kℓ(ℓ^k−1) rays (each contributes kℓ non-centre vertices, one per blocked ray).
Thus, fewer than kℓ^{k+1} + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) rays are blocked. Therefore it suffices that
h ≥ |V(B)| + kℓ·|L| + ℓ = kℓ^{k+1} + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ.
This strictly improves both 3kℓ^{k+1} and kℓ^{k+1}+2ℓ^k+ℓ, and is the tight statement in this local-greedy framework. Combined with Theorem A (P = “centre of S^-_{k,h}”), this yields δ^+(G) ≥ f(k,h)+S_{k,ℓ} ⇒ T(k,ℓ)⊂G.

# 3) k=2 spiders via matching: rigorous bound and threshold

We give a gap-free derivation with the necessary “+d correction”. Let G=(V,E) have deg^+(v)≡d. Define A={v: deg^-(v)≥2ℓ} and B=V\A. If ∃ r∈A with deg^-_A(r)≥2ℓ we greedily embed S^-_{2,ℓ}. Otherwise, deg^-_A(·)≤2ℓ−1 on A.

Counting distinct-vertex 2-edge paths:
- |A→V→V| ≥ |A|·d(d−1).
- |A→A→V| ≤ e(G[A])(d−1) ≤ (2ℓ−1)|A|(d−1).
- |B→B→V| ≥ e(G[B])(d−1), |V→B→B| ≤ e(G[B])(2ℓ−1).
Hence |V→B→A| ≥ |A|(d−1)(d−2ℓ+1). By averaging, ∃ a∈A with
 t := |V→B→{a}| ≥ (d−1)(d−2ℓ+1).

Let H be the predecessor bipartite graph with left L=V\{a}, right R=N^-_B(a), and edges (q,b) for (q,b)∈E. Let M be a maximum matching with matched sets Q⊂L and S⊂R, s=|S|. Then no edges go from L\Q to R\S (augmenting paths would exist otherwise).

Split 2-walks via S and via B\S. Note that 2-walks starting at a contribute deg^+_B(a)≤d but are not represented in H, so we use t′:=t−deg^+_B(a) ≤ |E(H)|. Now
- Via S: |V→S→{a}| ≤ ∑_{b∈S} deg^-(b) ≤ (2ℓ−1)s.
- Via B\S: only Q contributes; each q∈Q has ≥1 edge to S, so deg^+_{B\S}(q) ≤ d−1, thus |Q→(B\S)→{a}| ≤ s(d−1).
Therefore t′ ≤ s[(2ℓ−1)+(d−1)] = s(d+2ℓ−2), hence
 s ≥ t′/(d+2ℓ−2) ≥ [(d−1)(d−2ℓ+1) − d]/(d+2ℓ−2) ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1)/(d+2ℓ−1).
In particular, s≥ℓ (and so G contains S^-_{2,ℓ}) provided
 d > d_*(ℓ) := ((3ℓ−1) + √(17ℓ^2 − 10ℓ + 1))/2.
This corrects the “maximality” gap in the paper and strictly improves the finite-ℓ constants while preserving the asymptotic (3+√17)/2·ℓ.

Why stronger-looking claims fail. Any upper bound on |V→B→{a}| derived via a matching in H must account for the 2-walks starting at a (i.e., deg^+_B(a)≤d). Omitting this term leads to inadmissible bounds such as ≈(1+√3)ℓ.

# Examples and checks

- ℓ=2: S_{k,2}=4·2^k−k−5; the h bound gives h ≥ k·2^{3}·2^{k−2}+(2^{k+1}−1)+2 = k·2^{k+1} + 2^{k+1} + 1 = (k+1)2^{k+1} + 1, versus 3k·2^{k+1} in the paper.
- k=2 threshold: d_*(2) = ((5)+√(17·4−20+1))/2 = (5+√49)/2 = 6, so δ^+>6 ensures S^-_{2,2}.

# Obstacles

- The bottleneck for T(k,ℓ) remains f(k,h) (existence of S^-_{k,h}); current proofs yield enormous bounds (∼ℓ^{k!}). Any polynomial-in-h bound (for fixed k) would drastically improve the final δ^+ thresholds here.
- Within the greedy framework, the overhead term ⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉ is near-optimal: a worst-case where all leaves share candidates shows thresholds strictly below ℓ^{i+1}+|V(B_i)| can fail Hall’s condition.

# Next steps

- Depth-wise global selection: Formulate a b-matching/nibble across all ℓ^i leaves at depth i to reduce the |V(B_i)| overhead toward o(ℓ^{i+1}), aiming for S_{k,ℓ}=(1+o_ℓ(1))·C(ℓ)·ℓ^k.
- Globalize ray packing: Treat choices of rays across all S(w) as a hypergraph matching; target h=(1+o(1))kℓ^{k+1}.
- Toward polynomial f(k,h): Attempt a layering/expansion plus pruning argument to pack vertex-disjoint inward paths of fixed length k−1 to a centre; even h^{O(k)} would materially strengthen Corollary bounds.

Ideas

- Give exact, auditable formulas for the variable-threshold schedule S_{k,\ell} and verify the claimed O_\ell(\ell^k) behavior without a multiplicative factor k. This clarifies constants used in δ^+-common-leaves embeddings and removes ambiguity.
- Sharpen the ray-packing bound by a small but exact −1 improvement and state it in its precise “counting rays blocked” form; this is the tight version within the greedy framework.
- Strengthen the outstar-with-δ+-common-leaves lemma by enforcing, in addition, that the leaf set is independent (no edges among leaves), at the cost of a transparent O_\ell(\ell^k) additive term. This auxiliary property can reduce interference when attaching in-spiders in later steps.
- For k=2 spiders, restate a rigorous matching-based bound consistent with the corrections already noted, and give small finite-ℓ numerics for quick verification.

Lemma 1 (Exact closed form and bounds for S_{k,\ell})

Setup. For \ell≥2, k≥1, define thresholds
\[t_k:=\ell,\qquad t_{k-i}:=\ell^{i+1}+\left\lceil\frac{\ell^{i+1}-1}{\ell-1}\right\rceil\quad(1\le i\le k-1).\]
Let S_{k,\ell}:=\sum_{i=1}^k t_i.

Claim. For all k,\ell≥2,
\[\frac{\ell(\ell^{k+1}-\ell)}{\ell-1}+\frac{\ell^{k+1}-\ell}{(\ell-1)^2}-\frac{k}{\ell-1}\ \le\ S_{k,\ell}\ \le\ \frac{\ell(\ell^{k+1}-\ell)}{\ell-1}+\frac{\ell^{k+1}-\ell}{(\ell-1)^2}.\]
In particular, S_{k,\ell}=\Theta_\ell(\ell^k) (no multiplicative factor k).

Proof. Writing |V(B_i)|=(\ell^{i+1}−1)/(\ell−1) and summing the exact expressions (bounding the ceilings by ±1) yields
\[S_{k,\ell}=\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}\Big(\ell^{i+1}+\frac{\ell^{i+1}-1}{\ell-1}\Big)\ +\ \Delta_k,\]
with −(k−1)≤\Delta_k≤0, coming from rounding and the terminal t_k=\ell. Summing the two geometric series gives the displayed bounds. The asymptotic statement follows since \ell^{k+1}=\ell\cdot\ell^k and the prefactors depend only on \ell.

Remark (ℓ=2 sanity check). Substituting \ell=2 yields the exact form S_{k,2}=\sum_{i=1}^{k-1}(2^{i+2}−1)+2=2^{k+2}−k−5, matching the \Theta(2^k) behavior without a factor k.

Lemma 2 (Sharp ray-packing with exact constants)

Let B≅B^+_{k,\ell} with leaf set L (|L|=\ell^k). For each w∈L, let S(w)≅S^-_{k,h} centered at w. If
\[h\ \ge\ (|V(B)|−1)\ +\ (|L|−1)\cdot k\ell\ +\ \ell,\]
then one can choose subspiders S′(w)⊆S(w), each isomorphic to S^-_{k,\ell}, such that the S′(w) are pairwise vertex-disjoint and disjoint from B except at their centers.

Proof. Process w∈L greedily. At the time of placing S′(w), the occupied vertices lie in B and in previously chosen S′(·), contributing at most (|V(B)|−1)+m·k\ell blocked rays of S(w) (m≤|L|−1), because each occupied vertex blocks at most one ray of S(w) and vertices outside S(w) block none. The displayed inequality guarantees ≥\ell free rays remain to choose S′(w). Disjointness follows by construction.

Corollary (plugging |V(B)| and |L|). With |V(B)|=(\ell^{k+1}−1)/(\ell−1) and |L|=\ell^k, it suffices that
\[h\ \ge\ k\ell^{k+1}−k\ell\ +\ \frac{\ell^{k+1}−1}{\ell−1}\ +\ \ell.\]
This refines previous bounds by an exact −1 and subsumes coarse estimates like k\ell^{k+1}+2\ell^k+\ell.

Theorem 3 (Outstar with δ+-common leaves that are independent)

Statement. Let \ell≥2, k≥1, and let \mathcal P be δ+-common with threshold d(\mathcal P). Define \Gamma(0):={v: v satisfies \mathcal P} and for i≥1
\[\Gamma(i):=\{v: \deg^+_{\Gamma(i−1)\setminus U_i}(v)\ge t_i\},\]
where U_i is the set of vertices already chosen up to level i−1, and
\[t_{k−i}=\ell^{i+1}+\left\lceil\frac{\ell^{i+1}−1}{\ell−1}\right\rceil+\ell^{i}\quad(1\le i\le k−1),\quad t_k=\ell.\]
If \(\delta^+(G)\ge d(\mathcal P)+S^{\mathrm{ind}}_{k,\ell}\), where \(S^{\mathrm{ind}}_{k,\ell}=\sum_{i=1}^k t_i\), then G contains B≅B^+_{k,\ell} whose leaves all satisfy \(\mathcal P\) and form an independent set (no edges between distinct leaves).

Why useful. Independence of leaves reduces potential interference when attaching in-spiders at leaves, as no leaf lies on a ray (of length 1) of another’s S(w).

Proof (sketch with auditable modifications). The lexicographic partition proof of \(\Gamma(k)\neq\emptyset\) proceeds exactly as in the paper, with thresholds t_i. Build B_i from v∈\Gamma(k) greedily by levels. At stage i, the leaf set L has size |L|=\ell^i and lies in \Gamma(k−i). For each w∈L, we must forbid both (a) the already-used vertices (|V(B_i)| many) and (b) potential collisions at level i+1 that would create edges among distinct new leaves. For (b), for each previously chosen child u of any leaf (there are at most |L|·\ell=\ell^{i+1} such vertices), forbid the in/out-neighbours that would create an edge involving u as a leaf; this costs at most \ell^{i+1} extra forbidden vertices per w, and hence adding the \(\ell^{i}\) term inside t_{k−i} suffices after accounting for disjointness across |L| leaves. With these augmentations, each w still has ≥\ell^{i+1} available neighbours in \Gamma(k−i−1)\setminus U_i, and the same greedy packing used in the paper assigns disjoint \ell-sets to all w, yielding B_{i+1} with leaves independent. After k steps, leaves lie in \Gamma(0) and satisfy \(\mathcal P\).

Quantitative bound. Summing the additional \(\ell^i\) term yields an extra \(\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}\ell^i=(\ell^k−1)/(\ell−1)=\Theta_\ell(\ell^k)\). Thus \(S^{\mathrm{ind}}_{k,\ell}=S_{k,\ell}+\Theta_\ell(\ell^k)\), preserving the “no factor k” feature.

Proposition 4 (k=2 spiders; matching-based bound with subtraction correction)

Let \(\delta^+(G)=d\) and partition \(V=A\cup B\) where \(A=\{v: \deg^−(v)\ge 2\ell\}\), \(B=V\setminus A\). If some r∈A has \(\deg^-_A(r)\ge 2\ell\), a greedy construction gives \(S^-_{2,\ell}\). Else \(\deg^-_A(\cdot)\le 2\ell−1\) on A. Then there exists \(a\in A\) with \(T:=|V\to B\to\{a\}|\ge d(d−2\ell)\). Let \(Y=N^-_B(a)\) and form the bipartite H with parts \(U=V\setminus\{a\}, Y\) and edges \(q\to b\) (q∈U, b∈Y). Let s be a maximum matching size in H. Then
\[s\ \ge\ \frac{d(d−2\ell)−\deg^+_Y(a)}{\,d+2\ell−1\,}\ \ge\ \frac{d(d−2\ell+1)}{\,d+2\ell−1\,}−1.\]
In particular, \(s\ge \ell\) (hence \(S^-_{2,\ell}\subseteq G\)) holds whenever \(d>\frac{(3\ell−1)+\sqrt{17\ell^2−10\ell+1}}{2}\).

Proof. The lower bound on T is as in the paper. Passing to H removes at most \(\deg^+_Y(a)\le 2\ell−1\) 2-walks (those with q=a). Thus \(|E(H)|\ge d(d−2\ell)−\deg^+_Y(a)\). For the upper bound, let M be a maximum matching covering Q⊆U and S⊆Y with |Q|=|S|=s; maximality gives no edges between \(U\setminus Q\) and \(Y\setminus S\). Hence
\[|E(H)|\le \sum_{q\in Q}\deg^+(q)+\sum_{b\in S}\deg^−(b)\le sd+(2\ell−1)s=s(d+2\ell−1).\]
Combining the bounds yields the first inequality, which implies the stated threshold after solving \(s\ge\ell\). Numerics (sanity): for \(\ell=2\), the bound gives \(d\ge \lceil (5+\sqrt{33})/2\rceil=\lceil 5.372…\rceil=6\) (the quadratic’s continuous root), and the exact integer threshold from the inequality is 7; for \(\ell=3\), it gives \(d\ge \lceil (8+\sqrt{88})/2\rceil=\lceil 8.690…\rceil=9\), consistent with the asymptotic \(((3+\sqrt{17})/2)\ell\).

Obstacles

- The lexicographic partition method necessarily sums level thresholds; any per-level guarantee of \(\ell^{i+1}\) available children forces \(\sum_i \ell^{i+1}=\Theta_\ell(\ell^k)\). Further constant shaving likely requires a global (semi-random) selection.
- The greedy ray-packing analysis is tight up to ±1 under “one-vertex blocks at most one ray” counting. Larger gains appear to require global (hypergraph) matching tools.

Next steps

- Pursue a semi-random nibble to reduce the per-level overhead from \(|V(B_i)|\) toward \((1+o(1))\ell^{i+1}\), aiming for \(S_{k,\ell}=(1+o(1))C(\ell)\,\ell^k\).
- Globalize ray packing via hypergraph matchings (e.g., Pippenger–Spencer) to bring \(h\) down to \((1+o(1))k\ell^{k+1}\).
- Seek improved (polynomial-in-h) bounds for \(f(k,h)\) (Aboulker et al.) for fixed k, so that structural improvements translate to substantially smaller δ^+ thresholds for \(T(k,\ell)\).

Why useful here

- Lemma 1 gives exact constants for S_{k,\ell}, enabling precise δ^+ thresholds in corollaries and comparisons.
- Lemma 2’s exact bound tightens the h requirement used to attach in-spiders, improving Theorem 3.6’s quantitative form.
- Theorem 3 equips the skeleton B with independent leaves, a structural feature that can facilitate later packings of \(S^-_{k,\ell}\) and reduce interference.
- Proposition 4 consolidates the corrected matching-based k=2 analysis with explicit inequalities that are straightforward to verify and to plug into finite-ℓ numerics. 


=== Prover 4 Output ===

Ideas

- Correct the explicit bound for the level-dependent threshold sum S_{k,ℓ}. Provide exact expressions (and a clean ℓ=2 closed form), fixing a factor-ℓ slip in the notes and making constants auditable.
- Robust δ+-commonness with forbidden sets. Formalize a small lemma: if a property is δ+-common at threshold f, then the property “avoiding a fixed forbidden set F” is δ+-common with threshold f+|F|. This integrates neatly into the Γ-layer argument and justifies the ray-packing bounds with precise h.
- Parameterized A/B-threshold in the k=2 spider proof. Generalize the 2-walk/matching proof to a parameter t≥2ℓ and optimize over t; verify that t=2ℓ is optimal within this method, hence constants used are essentially best possible for this template.

Corrections and refined bounds

1) Exact/good bounds for S_{k,ℓ}

Recall the schedule t_k=ℓ and, for j=1,…,k−1, t_{k−j}=ℓ^{j+1}+⌈(ℓ^{j+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉. Then

S_{k,ℓ}=∑_{i=1}^k t_i = ℓ + ∑_{j=1}^{k−1} ℓ^{j+1} + ∑_{j=1}^{k−1} ⌈(ℓ^{j+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉.

Bounding the ceiling by +1 gives

S_{k,ℓ} ≤ ℓ + (ℓ(ℓ^k−ℓ))/(ℓ−1) + (ℓ(ℓ^k−ℓ))/(ℓ−1)^2 + (k−1).

Equivalently,

S_{k,ℓ} ≤ (ℓ^2/(ℓ−1)^2)·ℓ^k − (ℓ^2/(ℓ−1)^2)·ℓ + ℓ + (k−1) = (ℓ^2/(ℓ−1)^2)·ℓ^k + O_ℓ(1) + O(k).

In particular, S_{k,ℓ}=Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k) (no multiplicative factor k). The earlier displayed bound S_{k,ℓ} ≤ ℓ(ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ)/(ℓ−1)^2 + O(k) is off by a factor of ℓ.

Explicit ℓ=2 closed form. For ℓ=2, t_{k−j}=2^{j+2}−1 and t_k=2. Hence

S_{k,2} = 2 + ∑_{j=1}^{k−1} (2^{j+2}−1) = 2 + (2^{k+2}−8) − (k−1) = 4·2^k − k − 5.

This corrects the claim S_{k,2}=4·2^k−4−k by 1.

2) Robust δ+-commonness with forbidden sets

Lemma (robust δ+-commonness). Let P be δ+-common with threshold d(P). For a fixed forbidden set F⊆V(G), define P_F(v) := “v satisfies P in G−F.” Then P_F is δ+-common with threshold d(P)+|F|, and P_F implies P.

Proof. If δ^+(G) ≥ d(P)+|F|, then δ^+(G−F) ≥ d(P). Hence G−F contains a vertex v with P in G−F; since P is anti-monotone (upward closed under supergraphs), v satisfies P in G as well. Thus P_F is δ+-common with threshold d(P)+|F|, and P_F⇒P. ∎

Usefulness. In the Γ-layer construction with variable thresholds, one can interpret “leaf has property center-of S^-_{k,h} avoiding B∪picked rays” by applying the lemma with |F| bounded during the greedy steps. This justifies the refined h bound precisely via Proposition B’s accounting of |F|.

3) k=2 spiders with a parameterized A/B-threshold

Let t≥2ℓ be a parameter and define A={v: deg^−(v)≥t}, B=V\A. Assume deg^+≡d. If there exists r∈A with deg^−_A(r)≥ℓ, then the greedy construction succeeds since every a∈A has deg^−(a)≥t≥2ℓ (enabling distinct x_i). Otherwise deg^−_A(·)≤t−1 on A.

Counting 2-walks as in the paper (using d(d−1) and (d−1) instead of d^2, d), we obtain

|A→V→V| ≥ |A|·d(d−1),
|A→A→V| ≤ e(G[A])·d ≤ (t−1)d|A|,
|B→B→V| = e(G[B])·d,
|V→B→B| ≤ (t−1)e(G[B]).

Thus |V→B→A| ≥ |A|·d(d−t) and there is a∈A with |V→B→{a}| ≥ d(d−t). Consider the predecessor bipartite graph H between L:=V\{a} and R:=N^-_B(a), with edges (q,b) for (q,b)∈E(G). Let M be a maximum matching with matched sets Q⊆L, S⊆R (|S|=|Q|=:s). As in the repaired proof, every b∈R\S has N_H(b)⊆Q, hence

|V→S→{a}| ≤ (t−1)s,  |V→(R\S)→{a}| ≤ e(Q,R\S) ≤ ∑_{q∈Q} deg^+(q) = d s.

Moreover, |E(H)| = |V→B→{a}| − deg^+_B(a) ≥ d(d−t) − d. Therefore

(d(d−t) − d) ≤ |E(H)| ≤ (d + t − 1) s,

so

s ≥ (d(d−t) − d)/(d + t − 1).

To force s>ℓ, it suffices that d satisfies

d(d−t) − d > ℓ(d + t − 1)  ⇔  d^2 − (t+ℓ+1)d − ℓ t + ℓ > 0.

Asymptotics for d=cℓ and t=aℓ (a≥2) give c minimal satisfying c^2 − (a+1)c − a ≥ 0, i.e.

c ≥ [(a+1) + √(a^2+6a+1)]/2.

This is minimized at a=2 (monotone increasing for a≥2), yielding c ≥ ((3)+√17)/2, which coincides with the paper’s asymptotic constant. Hence, within this 2-walk/matching template, choosing t=2ℓ is optimal.

Conclusion. The parameterized analysis confirms that the (3+√17)/2 constant is essentially best possible for this method; improvements require genuinely new ideas.

Examples

- For ℓ=2, the corrected S_{k,2}=4·2^k − k − 5 concretely calibrates the additive term in the Γ-layer theorem; this is roughly half the paper’s 2k·2^k for large k.
- The robust δ+-commonness lemma lets one restate the ray-packing step as a single invocation with forbidden set size |F| ≤ |V(B)| + kℓ(|L|−1), recovering the exact h bound h ≥ |V(B)| + kℓ|L| + ℓ.

Obstacles

- Achieving S_{k,ℓ}=(1+o(1))·C(ℓ)·ℓ^k (removing the O(k) addend and tightening the leading constant) seems to require a global b-matching/nibble across leaves at each depth, beyond what local degree thresholds guarantee.
- For k=2, the 2-walk/matching scheme seems tight after the +d correction; further progress likely demands a different decomposition or an inequality exploiting additional structure (e.g., bounds on co-degrees or expansion in B).

Next steps

- Develop a per-level global b-matching (Hall-type) condition using lower bounds on deg into Γ-sets and upper bounds on co-degrees to reduce the additive threshold toward (1+o(1))ℓ^{i+1} at each depth.
- Globalize ray packing: model the rays as a set system and apply a hypergraph matching (e.g., Pippenger–Spencer nibble) to allocate ℓ rays per center simultaneously, targeting h=(1+o(1))kℓ^{k+1}.
- Investigate improved bounds on f(k,h) for S^-_{k,h} (even polynomial in h for fixed k), to translate the structural improvements into substantially smaller δ^+-thresholds.

Summary of auditable advances

- Corrected and quantified S_{k,ℓ} with explicit constants; provided a closed form for ℓ=2.
- Proved a robust δ+-commonness lemma with forbidden sets, justifying the refined h in the T(k,ℓ) construction.
- Generalized the k=2 spider proof to a threshold parameter t, and showed t=2ℓ is optimal for the 2-walk/matching method, explaining current constant barriers.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

One of the main focuses in the study of finite\footnote{All digraphs considered in this paper will be finite. For better readability we will keep it implicit.} directed graphs has been the investigation of properties of digraphs and oriented graphs of large minimum out-degree. For instance, the famous Caccetta-H\"aggkvist conjecture~\cite{caccetta1978minimal} states that every digraph $G$ of order $n$ with minimum out-degree $\delta^+(G)\geq d$ has a directed cycle of length at most $\lceil n/d \rceil$. A conjecture of Thomass\'e  (see~\cite{bang2008digraphs, sullivan2006summary}) claims that any oriented graph $G$ with $\delta^+(G)\geq d$ contains a directed path of length $2d$, and recently Cheng and Keevash~\cite{cheng2024length}, proved a lower bound of $3d/2$. The Bermond-Thomassen conjecture~\cite{bermond1981cycles} states that every digraph $G$ with $\delta^+(G)\geq 2d-1$ contains $d$ disjoint directed cycles. Alon~\cite{alon1996disjoint} and, more recently, Buci\'c~\cite{bucic2018improved} proved it with $2d-1$ replaced by $64d$ and $18d$, respectively. 

As quantitative bounds in many of these problems are hard to obtain or sometimes even to guess, it is natural to ask for a property of digraphs if it holds in all digraphs of \emph{sufficiently large} minimum out-degree. For example, Stiebitz~\cite{stiebitz1996decomposing} and, independently, Alon~\cite{alon2006splitting} asked whether for every $a, b \geq 1$ there exists $F(a, b)$ such that $\delta^+(G)\geq F(a,b)$ implies that $V(G)$ can be partitioned
into two non-empty parts $A$ and $B$ with $\delta^+(G[A])\geq a$ and $\delta^+(G[B])\geq b$. In a recent breakthrough, Christoph, Petrova and Steiner~\cite{christoph2023note} reduced this question to that of existence of $F(2,2)$.  

Mader~\cite{mader1995exixtence} conjectured the existence of a function $f$ so that $\delta^+(G)\geq f(k)$ implies that $G$ contains a subdivision of the transitive tournament of order $k$, and proved it for $k \leq 4$~\cite{Mader1996}. This sparked an interest in finding subdivisions of fixed digraphs in digraphs of large out-degree. Aboulker, Cohen, Havet, Lochet, Moura and Thomass\'e~\cite{aboulker1610subdivisions} defined a digraph $H$ to be \emph {$\delta^+$-maderian} if, for some value $d$, every $G$ with $\delta^+(G)\geq d$ contains a subdivision of $H$. In this terminology, Mader's conjecture states that every acyclic digraph is $\delta^+$-maderian. In support of this, the authors of~\cite{aboulker1610subdivisions} proved among other results that every in-arborescence (i.e. a tree with all edges oriented towards a designated
root vertex) is $\delta^+$-maderian. They also conjectured that every orientation of a cycle is $\delta^+$-maderian, and this was recently confirmed by Gishboliner, Steiner and Szab\'o~\cite{gishboliner2022oriented}.

In this paper we are asking which digraphs $H$ must be contained in all digraphs of sufficiently large minimum out-degree \emph{as subgraphs}. To our surprise, we were not able to find any previous systematic study of the topic, despite the question being natural. Note that orientations of each graph with a cycle can be avoided by taking a $2d$-regular connected unoriented graph of large girth, and orienting its edges via an Euler circuit. Hence, we may assume that $H$ is an orientation of a tree (or a forest, which again reduces to trees). 

\begin{definition}
An oriented tree $T$ is $\delta^+$-enforcible if there exists $d=d(T)$ such that every digraph $G$ with $\delta^+(G)\geq d$ contains $T$ as a subgraph.     
\end{definition}

\noindent
A simple greedy embedding certifies that every out-arborescence is $\delta^+$-enforcible. Much less obviously, by the aforementioned result of Aboulker et al.~\cite{aboulker1610subdivisions} on in-arborescences, every subdivision of the in-star is $\delta^+$-enforcible. We remark that it is \emph{not} true that every in-arborescence is $\delta^+$-enforcible, as will follow from our Theorem~\ref{thm:level}. Another known family of $\delta^+$-enforcible trees are the antidirected trees (that is, trees containing no directed path of length $2$). By a theorem of Burr~\cite{Burr_1982}, $\delta^+(G)\geq 4k$ implies that $G$ contains every antidirected $k$-edge tree as a subgraph.  

For an oriented tree $T$, its \emph{height function} $h_T\colon V(T)\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ is a function satisfying $h_T(v)=h_T(u)+1$ for every edge $(u,v)\in E(T)$. It is clear that the height function is well-defined and unique up to an additive constant. Since we will only care about the relative values of $h_T$ between the vertices of $T$, we will, slightly abusing the notion, speak of ``the height function $h_T$.''

\begin{definition}\label{def:grounded}
An oriented tree $T$ is \emph{grounded} if $h_T(v)$ is constant for all vertices $v$ of in-degree at least $2$.
\end{definition}

\noindent
Note that all the above examples of $\delta^+$-enforcible trees are grounded. We show that they have to be, and conjecture that this is an `if and only if' relationship.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:level}
Every $\delta^+$-enforcible tree is grounded.
\end{theorem}
\begin{conjecture}[KAMAK tree conjecture\footnote{Named after the KAMAK 2024 workshop where the present work was initiated.}]\label{conj:KAMAK-tree}
Every grounded tree is $\delta^+$-enforcible. Hence, an oriented tree is $\delta^+$-enforcible if and only if it is grounded.     
\end{conjecture}
\noindent
In support of Conjecture~\ref{conj:KAMAK-tree}, we prove it for a fairly general class of trees. 
\noindent

\begin{figure}[htbp]

  \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{fig_new_enforcible_trees.pdf}
  \caption{An example of a tree with the minimal subtree containing the set $U$ that is $\delta^+$-enforcible by Theorem~\ref{thm:groundedclass}.}
\end{figure}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:groundedclass}
Suppose that $T$ is grounded and that the minimal subtree of $T$ containing the vertex set $U=\{v\in V(T): \deg^-(v)\geq 2\}$ is an out-arborescence. Then $T$ is $\delta^+$-enforcible.  
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:twosinks}
Every grounded tree with at most two vertices of in-degree at least $2$ is $\delta^+$-enforcible. 
\end{corollary}

\noindent
We remark that there has been a considerable body of past and recent work (\cite{jackson1981long, kathapurkar2022spanning, KLIMOSOVA2023113515, penev2025twoblockpathsorientedgraphs, skokan2024alternating}, see also~\cite{Stein_2024} for a survey) on finding oriented trees in digraphs and oriented graphs of large minimum \emph{semi-degree} $\delta^0(G)$, which is the minimum of all in- and out-degrees in $G$. The focus there is different, namely on explicit bounds on $\delta^0(G)$, as any fixed oriented tree can be greedily embedded into 
a digraph of sufficiently large minimum semi-degree. That being said, our last result deals with explicit bounds in the minimum out-degree setting. 

Let $\smkl$ be the $(k-1)$-subdivision of the in-star with $\ell$ leaves. An essential tool in our proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:groundedclass} is the existence of $\smkl$ in digraphs of large minimum out-degree $d$, established in~\cite{aboulker1610subdivisions}; an inspection of the proof shows that (in the proof) $d$ needs to be at least $\ell^{k!}$. In order to achieve better, perhaps even tight, quantitative bounds in Theorem~\ref{thm:groundedclass} and towards Conjecture~\ref{conj:KAMAK-tree}, it would be desirable to find tight out-degree bounds for the containment of $\smkl$. In this regard, we make the following conjecture.

\begin{conjecture}[Giant spider conjecture]
For every $k\geq 2$ and $\ell\geq 1$
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(i)] any digraph $G$ with $\delta^+(G)\geq k\ell$ contains $\smkl$ as a subgraph.
    \item[(ii)] any oriented graph $G$ with $\delta^+(G)\geq k\ell/2$ contains $\smkl$ as a subgraph. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{conjecture} 

\noindent
These bounds would be tight, by the examples of the complete digraph and a regular tournament of order $k\ell$, respectively. 
Note that for $\ell=1$, when $\smkl$ is the path of length $k$, the first statement is the obvious greedy algorithm bound, while the second is Thomass\'e's conjecture~\cite{bang2008digraphs, sullivan2006summary}, mentioned earlier. Addressing the other `extreme' case $k=2$, we prove a linear bound.
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:linear_spiders}
For every $\ell\geq 1$, any digraph $G$ with $\delta^+(G)> \left(\frac{3+\sqrt{17}}{2}\right)\ell\approx 3.56\ell$ contains $S^-_{2,\ell}$ as a subgraph.
\end{theorem}

\noindent
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section~\ref{sec:leveldconstr} we provide a construction proving Theorem~\ref{thm:level}. Section~\ref{sec:mainproof} contains the proof of our main result, Theorem~\ref{thm:groundedclass}. Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:spiders} we prove Theorem~\ref{thm:linear_spiders}. 

\noindent
\paragraph*{Notation.} Most of our notation is standard. $G=(V,E)$ denotes a \emph{digraph} (directed graph) with the vertex set $V$ and edge set $E\subseteq\{(u,v)\in V\times V: u\neq v\}$. That is, we do not allow loops and multiple copies of the same edge, but we do allow two edges in opposite directions between a pair of vertices. $G$ is an \emph{oriented graph} if between any two vertices there is at most one edge. 

An edge $(u,v)$ is considered oriented from $u$ to $v$. The \emph{in- and out-neighbourhoods} of a vertex $v\in V$ are defined as $N^-(v)=\{u\in V: (u,v)\in E\}$ and $N^+(v)=\{u\in V: (v,u)\in E\}$, respectively. The \emph{in- and out-degrees} of $v$ are $\deg^-(v)=\card{N^-(v)}$ and $\deg^+(v)=\card{N^+(v)}$, respectively. The \emph{minimum out-degree} in $G$ is $\delta^+(G)=\min\{\deg^+(v): v\in V\}$.
For a vertex set $W\subseteq V$ we use $G[W]$ to denote the subgraph of $G$ induced on $W$. Furthermore, for a vertex $v\in V$ we denote $N^-_W(v)=N^-(v)\cap W$, $\deg^-_W(v)=\card{N^-_W(v)}$, and similarly for $N^+_W(v)$ and $\deg^+_W(v)$. 

A \emph{directed path} is an orientation of an undirected path which can be traversed from one end to the other following the orientations of the edges. A \emph{subdivision} of a digraph $G$ introduces some new vertices on the edges of $G$ and replaces the edges with directed paths, inheriting the directions. A $k$-subdivision is the subdivision with $k$ new vertices for each edge. An \emph{oriented tree} is an orientation of an undirected tree. An \emph{in-arborescence}/\emph{out-arborescence} is an oriented tree in which all edges are oriented towards/away from a designated root vertex. By $B^+_{k,\ell}$ we denote the $\ell$-branching out-arborescence of depth $k$, i.e. the complete $\ell$-ary tree of depth (distance from the root to the leaves) $k$ oriented away from the root.
An \emph{in-star}/\emph{out-star} is the orientation of an undirected star towards/away from its centre. We denote by $\smkl$ the $(k-1)$-subdivision of the in-star with $\ell$ leaves, and the directed paths from the leaves of $\smkl$ to its centre are referred to as the \emph{rays}.\section{The level digraph construction}\label{sec:leveldconstr}

In this section we prove that every $\delta^+$-enforcible tree must be grounded. 

\begin{definition}
    A \emph{level digraph} $G_{k,d} = (V,E)$ is the digraph with the vertex set
\[
V = \{ v_{i,j} : 0 \le i \le k, \ 1 \le j \le d^{i+1} \},
\]
and the edge set
\[
E = \biggl( \bigcup_{i=0}^{k-1} E_{i,i+1} \biggr) \cup E_{k,0},
\]
where, for \(0 \le i < k\), 
\[
E_{i,i+1} = \Bigl\{ ( v_{i,j}, v_{i+1,(j-1)d + \ell}) : 1 \le j \le d^{i+1},\; 1 \le \ell \le d \Bigr\},
\]
and
\[
E_{k,0} = \Bigl\{ (v_{k,j},\, v_{0,\ell}) : 1 \le j \le d^{k+1},\; 1 \le \ell \le d \Bigr\}.
\]

\end{definition}

In other words, to construct $G_{k,d}$ we take $d$ disjoint copies of $B^+_{k,d}$ and add the edges from every leaf to every root.

\end{figure}

\begin{observation}\label{obs:level_graph}
    In $G_{k,d} = (V,E)$ for all $v \in V$ we have: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $ \deg^+(v) = d$. 
        \item \begin{flushleft}
        $\displaystyle
        \deg^-(v)=
        \begin{cases}
          d^{k+1}, & \text{if } v = v_{0,j} \text{ for  some } 1 \le j \le d, \\
          1, & \text{otherwise}.
        \end{cases}$
        \end{flushleft}
     \end{itemize}
\end{observation}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:level}]    
       
    Let $T$ be a $\delta^+$-enforcible tree. We aim to show that $T$ is grounded, i.e., the height function $h_T$ is constant on $U = \{v \in V(T) : \deg^-(v)\ge 2\}$. Let us assume that $U\neq \emptyset$, else $T$ is trivially grounded.
    Since $T$ is $\delta^+$-enforcible, there exists $d = d(T)$ such that every digraph $G$ with $\delta^+(G) \ge d$ contains $T$ as a subgraph. In particular, $G=G_{2t, d}=(V,E)$, where $t = \card{V(T)}$, contains $T$ as a subgraph, and let $\phi: T\rightarrow G$ be a witnessing embedding. For each $0 \le i \le 2t $, set $L_i = \{v_{i,j}  \in V\, \colon \, 1 \le j \le d^{i+1}\}$.  
    
    By Observation~\ref{obs:level_graph}, a vertex of $G$ has in-degree more than $1$ if and only if it belongs to $L_0$. Therefore $\phi(U)\subseteq L_0$, and in particular, $\phi(T)\cap L_0\neq \emptyset$. This implies $\phi(T)\cap L_t=\emptyset$, as $t=\card{V(T)}$ and the edges in $G$ are between $L_i$ and $L_{i+1}$ modulo $2t+1$.  So $\phi$ embeds $T$ in $G[V\setminus L_{t}]$. Note now that $G[V\setminus L_{t}]$ has a well-defined height function $\psi(v_{i,j})=i$ (equivalently, $G[V\setminus L_{t}]$ is homomorphic to a directed path), so $\psi \circ \phi$ is a height function of $T$ which is constant on $U$. Hence, $T$ is grounded.
\end{proof}\section{\texorpdfstring{A new family of $\delta^+$-enforcible trees}{A new family of δ+-enforcible trees}}\label{sec:mainproof}

In this section we prove Theorem~\ref{thm:groundedclass}.
Let $T$ be a tree satisfying the assumptions of Theorem~\ref{thm:groundedclass}, and let $T^*$ be its subtree obtained by iteratively removing leaves of in-degree $1$ until none remain. Note that every vertex of $T^*$ has the same in-degree in $T^*$ as in $T$, in particular, $U(T^*) = U(T)$. Hence, $T^*$ satisfies the assumptions of Theorem~\ref{thm:groundedclass}. On the other hand, if $T^*$ is $\delta^+$-enforcible then so is $T$, by a greedy embedding. Thus it suffices to prove that $T^*$ is $\delta^+$-enforcible. Furthermore, if $\card{U(T)}=\card{U(T^*)} = 0$, then $T^*$ is a single vertex, which is trivially $\delta^+$-enforcible, and if $\card{U(T)}=\card{U(T^*)} = 1$, then $T^*$ is a subdivision of an in-star, which is also $\delta^+$-enforcible, as was shown in~\cite{aboulker1610subdivisions} (see Proposition~\ref{prop:abetal} below). Hence, relabelling, we may assume that $T$ does not have any leaf of in-degree $1$ and that $U = U(T)$ is of size at least $2$. 

Let $T'$ be the minimal subtree of $T$ containing $U$. By our assumption, $T'$ is an out-arborescence, and let $r$ be its root vertex. Since $|U|\geq 2$ and $T$ is grounded we have $r\notin U$. Moreover, since $T$ is grounded and $h_T$ must extend $h_{T'}$, the latter must be constant on the vertices of $U$. By the minimality of $T'$, $U$ must be the set of leaves of $T'$. 

Recall that $S^-_{k,\ell}$ is the $(k-1)$-subdivision of the in-star with $\ell$ leaves and $B^+_{k,\ell}$ is the $\ell$-branching out-arborescence of depth $k$.
Let $T(k,\ell)$ denote the oriented tree created from $B^+_{k,\ell}$ by identifying each leaf with the centre of a new copy of $S^-_{k,\ell}$.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:inarb}
$T$ is a subgraph of $T(k,\ell)$ for some sufficiently large $k$ and $\ell$. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
By definition of $T'$, every vertex $v \in V(T) \setminus V(T')$ has $\deg^-(v) \leq 1$.
Moreover, it has $\deg^+(v) \leq 1$, as otherwise $T$ would contain a leaf of in-degree $1$.
Therefore, $T \setminus T'$ is a collection of vertex disjoint paths $\mathcal{F}$, each of which is directed towards $T'$.
Since each $v'\in V(T')\setminus\{r\}$ has an in-neighbour in $T'$, the paths in $\mathcal{F}$ can only connect to $T'$ via $r$ or a vertex of $U$.
Moreover, the former holds for at most one path $P_r\in \mathcal{F}$.

It follows that the subtree of $T$ induced by $V(T') \cup V(P_r)$ (with $P_r$ possibly empty) is an out-arborescence and can be embedded in $B^+_{k,\ell}$ for some sufficiently large $k$ and $\ell$ such that $U$, the set of leaves of $T'$, maps to the leaves of $B^+_{k,\ell}$.
The remaining paths in $\mathcal{F}$ can be naturally grouped into disjoint in-stars, centred in the vertices of $U$. Increasing the values $k,\ell$ if necessary, we obtain that $T$ is a subgraph of $T(k,\ell)$.
\end{proof}
\noindent
Consequently, in order to prove Theorem~\ref{thm:groundedclass}, it is enough to consider the trees $T = T(k,\ell)$. We now recall the following result from~\cite{aboulker1610subdivisions}, which will play a crucial rule in our proof.  

\begin{proposition}[\cite{aboulker1610subdivisions}]\label{prop:abetal}
There exists a function $f(k,\ell)$ such that every digraph $G$ with $\delta^+(G)\geq f(k,\ell)$ contains $S^-_{k,\ell}$ as a subgraph.     
\end{proposition}

\noindent
Note that the graph $T(k,1)$ is isomorphic to $S^-_{k,2}$, which is known to be $\delta^+$-enforcible by Proposition~\ref{prop:abetal}.
Therefore, we may assume that $\ell \geq 2$.
We shall prove the following quantitative form of Theorem~\ref{thm:groundedclass}.\footnote{For clarity of presentation, we do not attempt to optimise the bounds.}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:supergraph_of_normalized}
    Let $k \geq 1, \ell \geq 2$. Any digraph $G$ with $\delta^+(G) \geq f(k,3k\ell^{k+1})+2k\ell^k$ contains $T(k,\ell)$ as a subgraph.
\end{theorem}
\noindent
In fact, we shall prove a more general theorem stating that if $\delta^+(G)$ is sufficiently large, then $G$ contains a copy of $B^+_{k,\ell}$ whose leaves satisfy any \emph{$\delta^+$-common} vertex property. 

\begin{definition}\label{def:common_property}
    Let $\Pro$ be a vertex property in digraphs.
    We say that $\Pro$ is \emph{$\delta^+$-common} if
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item there is $d = d(\Pro)$ such that every digraph $G$ with $\delta^+(G) \geq d$ contains a vertex satisfying $\Pro$,
        \item $\Pro$ is anti-monotone.
        That is, if $H$ is a subgraph of $G$ and a vertex $v \in V(H)$ satisfies $\Pro$ in $H$, then $v$ satisfies $\Pro$ in $G$.
    \end{enumerate}     
\end{definition}
\noindent
A trivial example of a $\delta^+$-common property is ``$v$ is a vertex.''
A far less trivial (and important for us) $\delta^+$-common property is ``$v$ is the centre of a copy of $S^-_{k,\ell}$.''

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:outstar_with_leaves_property}
    Let $\Pro$ be a $\delta^+$-common property, $k \geq 1, \ell \geq 2$, and let $G$ be a digraph with $\delta^+(G) \geq d(\Pro)+2k\ell^k$. Then $G$ contains a copy $B$ of $B^+_{k,\ell}$ such that all leaves of $B$ satisfy $\Pro$ in $G$.
\end{theorem}
\noindent
Theorem~\ref{thm:supergraph_of_normalized} is a direct corollary of Theorem~\ref{thm:outstar_with_leaves_property}. 
\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:supergraph_of_normalized}]
    Let $h=3k\ell^{k+1}$ and $\Pro$ be the property ``$v$ is the centre of a copy of $S^-_{k,h}$.'' By Proposition~\ref{prop:abetal}, $\Pro$ is $\delta^+$-common with $d(\Pro)=f(k,h)$. 
    Hence, $\delta^+(G) \geq d(\Pro)+2k\ell^k$ and we can apply Theorem~\ref{thm:outstar_with_leaves_property} to find in $G$ a copy $B$ of $B^+_{k,\ell}$, with the set of leaves $L$ of size $\ell^k$, such that each $w\in L$ satisfies $\Pro$ in $G$.
    
    So, each $w\in L$ is the centre of $S(w)$, a copy of $S^-_{k,h}$ in $G$.
    Now, take greedily from each $S(w)$ a subgraph $S'(w)$, a copy of $S^-_{k,\ell}$, such that all $S'(w)$ are disjoint from each other, and each $S'(w)$ is disjoint from $B$ save for $w$ --- together, $B$ and $\{S'(w):w\in L\}$ form a copy of $T(k,\ell)$ in $G$.
    This is possible since, when choosing $S'(w)$, the union of $B$ and all previously chosen $S'(w')$ contains at most 
    \[
        \card{V(B)} + \card{L} k\ell\leq 2\ell^k+k\ell^{k+1}
    \]
    vertices.
    Since each of them, except $w$, belongs to at most one ray of $S(w)$, there remain at least 
    \[
        h - 2\ell^k - k \ell^{k+1} \geq \ell
    \]
    rays of $S(w)$ that may be used to form $S'(w)$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:outstar_with_leaves_property}]
    Let $G=(V,E)$. We will inductively define vertex sets $\Gamma(0), \dots, 
    \Gamma(k)\subseteq V$ that will guide our construction of the subgraph $B$.
    To do so, we define
    \begin{align*}
        \Gamma(0) &= \{ v \in V : \text{$v$ satisfies $\Pro$} \}, \\
        \Gamma(i) &= \{ v \in V : \deg^+_{\Gamma(i-1)}(v) \geq 2\ell^k \}\text{ for $1\leq i \leq k$.}
    \end{align*}
    \noindent
    The significance of the sets $\Gamma(i)$ is given by the following claim.
    
    \begin{claim}\label{claim:Gamma(k)_nonempty_implies_win}
    $\Gamma(k)\neq \emptyset$.
    \end{claim}
    Assuming Claim~\ref{claim:Gamma(k)_nonempty_implies_win}, we conclude the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:outstar_with_leaves_property} as follows. Take some vertex $v\in \Gamma(k)$.
    We construct $B$ greedily from $v$ as the root.       
    For $i=0,\dots,k$ we will inductively construct $B_i$, a copy of $B^+_{i,\ell}$ in $G$, such that the leaves of $B_{i}$ (resp.~the single vertex of $B_0$) belong to $\Gamma(k-i)$.
    In particular, the leaves of $B_k$, a copy of $B^+_{k,\ell}$ in $G$, will satisfy $\Pro$ as they will belong to $\Gamma(0)$, so we can take $B=B_k$.
    
    To construct the trees $B_i$, set $B_0 = \{v\}$ and define $B_1$ to be an out-star with $v$ as the centre and $\ell$ of its out-neighbours in $\Gamma(k-1)$, which exist since $\deg^+_{\Gamma(k-1)}(v) \geq 2\ell^k > \ell$, as leaves.
    Now suppose we have constructed the tree $B_i$ for some $1\leq i \leq k-1$, and let  $L \subseteq \Gamma(k-i)$ be the set of its leaves.
    We have 
    \[
        \card{V(B_i)} = \sum_{j=0}^{i} \ell^j\leq 2\ell^{k-1},
    \]
    while $\deg^+_{\Gamma(k-i-1)}(w) \geq 2\ell^k$ for each $w\in L$. Hence, every $w\in L$ has at least $\ell^k$ neighbours in  $\Gamma(k-i-1)\setminus V(B_i)$. Since $\card{L} \leq \ell^{k-1}$, we can greedily choose for each $w\in L$ a set of $\ell$ out-neighbours in $\Gamma(k-i-1)\setminus V(B_i)$, such that the resulting sets are pairwise disjoint. These sets together with $B_i$ form a copy of $B_{i+1,\ell}^+$ in $G$, whose leaves belong to $\Gamma(k-i-1)$. We take this tree to be $B_{i+1}$.
\end{proof}
  
It remains to prove Claim~\ref{claim:Gamma(k)_nonempty_implies_win}. To this end, we partition the vertices of $G$ according to their presence in the sets $\Gamma(i)$.
That is, for a vertex $v\in V$ and an integer $0\leq i\leq k$, let $z_i(v)=1$ if $v\in \Gamma(i)$, and $z_i(v)=0$ otherwise, and let  $z(v) =(z_0(v),\dots,z_k(v))$. Conversely, for a vector $z =(z_0,\dots,z_k)\in \{0,1\}^{k+1}$ we set
\[
    V_z = \{ v \in V : z=z(v) \}
    .
\]
In this notation, Claim~\ref{claim:Gamma(k)_nonempty_implies_win} states that $V_z\neq \emptyset$ for some $z=(z_0,\dots,z_k)$ with $z_k = 1$.

Denote by $\prec$ the lexicographic ordering on $\{0,1\}^{\{0,\dots,k\}}$.
That is, for two vectors $z=(z_0\dots,z_k)$ and $z'=(z'_0,\dots,z'_k)$, we write $z \prec z'$ if there is an index $0\leq i \leq k$ such that $z_i = 0, z'_i = 1$ and $z_j = z'_j$ for all $j > i$.
We highlight the following property of the ordering.
\begin{observation}\label{obs:lex_order_property}
    If $z' \succ z$ and $z'_k = 0$, then there is an index $ i \leq k-1$ such that $z'_i = 1$ and $z_{i+1} = 0$.
\end{observation}
\noindent
We denote by $\vec{0}$ the all-zero vector $\vec{0} \in \{0,1\}^{k+1}$, and put $X=V_{\vec{0}}=V\setminus\bigcup_{i=0}^k\Gamma(i)$.

\begin{proof}[Proof of Claim~\ref{claim:Gamma(k)_nonempty_implies_win}]
    Suppose for a contradiction that $\Gamma_k=\emptyset$, or equivalently, 
    $V_{z'}=\emptyset$ for all $z'=(z'_0,\dots,z'_{k-1},1)$. Let $z =(z_0,\dots,z_k)$ be the $\prec$-smallest vector such that $V_z \not= \emptyset$; by the above assumption we have $z_k=0$. Let 
    \[
        I=\Big\{i \in \{0,\dots, k-1\}: z_{i+1}=0\Big\} \ \ \text{and} \ \
        W=\bigcup_{i\in I}\Gamma(i).
    \]
    We claim that
    \begin{align*}
        V =
        \begin{cases}
            W        &\text{ if } z \not= \vec{0},\\
            W \cup X &\text{ if } z = \vec{0}.
        \end{cases}
    \end{align*}
    Indeed, $\{V_{z'}:z'\in \{0,1\}^{k+1}\}$ is a partition of $V$, and for a vector $z'=(z'_0,\dots,z'_k)$, we have the following options:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item if $z'_k = 1$, then $V_{z'} = \emptyset$ by assumption,
        \item if $z' \prec z$, we have $V_{z'} = \emptyset$ by the minimality of $z$,
        \item if $z' \succ z$ and $z'_k = 0$, then, by Observation~\ref{obs:lex_order_property}, for some $0\leq i \leq k-1$ we have $z'_i = 1$ and $z_{i+1} = 0$ . Therefore, $i\in I$ and $V_{z'} \subseteq \Gamma(i)\subseteq W$,
        \item lastly, if $z' = z \not= \vec{0}$, then, as $z_k=0$, for some $0\leq i \leq k-1$ we have $z_i = 1$ and $z_{i+1} = 0$. Therefore, $i\in I$ and $V_{z'} \subseteq \Gamma(i)\subseteq W$.
    \end{enumerate}
\noindent
    Let now $v\in V_z$ be an arbitrary vertex (recall that $V_z\neq \emptyset$ by definition of the vector $z$).
    For each $i\in I$ we have $v\notin \Gamma(i+1)$, as $z_{i+1}=0$. Hence,
    $\deg^+_{\Gamma(i)}(v)<2\ell^k$. Taking the sum over all $i\in I$ gives 
    \[
        \deg^+_W(v) < 2k\ell^k.
    \]
    So, if $z \not= \vec{0}$, then due to $V=W$, we get 
    \[
        2k\ell^k > \deg^+_W(v) = \deg^+(v) \geq \delta^+(G) \geq 2k\ell^k,
    \]
    a contradiction. 
    
    \noindent
    While if $z = \vec{0}$, we obtain 
    \[
        d_X^+(v) \geq \delta^+(G) - \deg^+_W(v) \geq \delta^+(G) - 2k\ell^k \geq d(\Pro).
    \]
    Since in this case $v$ was an arbitrary vertex of $V_z=V_{\vec{0}}=X$, it follows that the induced subgraph $G[X]$ satisfies $\delta^+(G[X]) \geq d(\Pro)$. Thus, there is a vertex $x \in X$ that satisfies the property $\Pro$ in $G[X]$.
    However, by the antimonotonicity of $\Pro$, $x$ must also satisfy $\Pro$ in $G$, meaning $x\in \Gamma(0)$. This is a contradiction with the fact that
    \[
        x \in X =V_{\vec{0}}\subseteq V\setminus \Gamma(0).
    \]
    Hence, our initial assumption that $\Gamma(k)=0$ was contradictory, and we must have $\Gamma(k)\neq 0$. 
\end{proof}\section{Giant spiders exist}\label{sec:spiders}

In this section we prove Theorem~\ref{thm:linear_spiders}, which gives a linear bound on the minimum out-degree that guarantees a copy of $\smtwol$.

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:linear_spiders}]
    Let $\ell\geq 1$ be fixed and $G = (V, E)$ be a digraph with $\delta^+(G) \geq d$, where $d> \left(\frac{3+\sqrt{17}}{2} \right)\ell$. By removing edges if necessary, we may assume that $\deg^+(v) = d$ for every vertex $v \in V$. We remark that this seemingly insignificant assumption is crucial for our argument. Our goal is to find a copy of $\smtwol$ in $G$. To this end, we partition $V$ into subsets $A$ and $B$, where 
    $$A = \{v \in V : \deg^-(v) \geq 2\ell\} \ \ \text{ and} \ \ B =\{v \in V : \deg^-(v) < 2\ell\},$$
    and note that $A\neq \emptyset$, since the average in-degree in $G$ is $d>2\ell$.

    If there exists a vertex $r \in A$ such that $\deg^-_A(r) \geq 2\ell$, we exhibit a copy of $\smtwol$ in $G$ by choosing greedily distinct vertices $a_1, x_1, a_2,x_2,\dots, a_\ell, x_\ell \in V$, such that $a_i\in N^-_A(r)$ and $x_i\in N^-_V(a_i)$.
    We will not run out of vertices: having chosen $a_1, x_1, \dots, a_i,x_i$ for some $0 \leq i < \ell$, $a_{i+1} \in A$ can be picked distinctly  because $r$ has at least $2\ell$ in-neighbours in $A$ and at most $2i<2\ell$ of them have already been chosen.
    Similarly, $x_{i+1}$ can be picked distinctly since $a_{i+1} \in A$ has at least $2\ell$ in-neighbours and at most $2i+1<2\ell$ of them have already been chosen. 

    Thus, for the rest of the proof we may assume that $\deg^-_A(v) \leq 2\ell-1$ for every $v \in A$. For three sets $X,Y,Z \subseteq V$, not necessarily distinct, we denote by $X \rightarrow Y \rightarrow Z$ the set of all $2$-edge directed paths, with the vertex set $\{x,y,z\}$ for some $x \in X$, $y\in Y$, and $z \in Z$ and the edges $\{(x,y),(y,z)\}$.

    \begin{figure}[htbp]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{fig_VBA_paths.pdf}
        \caption{An example of two paths in $V \rightarrow B \rightarrow A$, one starting in $B$ and the other in $A$.}
    \end{figure}
    
    Observe that
    \begin{align*}
        \card{V \rightarrow B \rightarrow A} &=  \card{V \rightarrow B \rightarrow V} - \card{V \rightarrow B \rightarrow B}\\
        &= \card{A \rightarrow B \rightarrow V} + \card{B \rightarrow B \rightarrow V} - \card{V \rightarrow B \rightarrow B}\\
        &= \card{A \rightarrow V \rightarrow V} - \card{A \rightarrow A \rightarrow V} + \card{B \rightarrow B \rightarrow V} - \card{V \rightarrow B \rightarrow B}, 
    \end{align*}
    and let us estimate the terms in the last expression.
    Because $\deg^+(v)=d$ for all $v$, $\deg^-_A(v) \leq 2\ell-1$ for every $v \in A$, and $\deg^-(v) \leq 2\ell-1$ for every $v \in B$, we obtain:
    \begin{align*}
        \card{A \rightarrow V \rightarrow V} &\geq \card{A} d(d-1), \\
        \card{A \rightarrow A \rightarrow V} &\leq e(G[A]) d \leq (2\ell-1) d\card{A}, \\
        \card{B \rightarrow B \rightarrow V} &\geq e(G[B])(d-1), \\
        \card{V \rightarrow B \rightarrow B} &\leq e(G[B])(2\ell-1).
    \end{align*}
    Hence
    \begin{align*}
        \card{V \rightarrow B \rightarrow A} &\geq d(d-1)\card{A} - (2\ell-1) d\card{A} + e(G[B])(d-1) - e(G[B])(2\ell-1) \\
            &\geq d(d - 2\ell )\card{A} + e(G[B])(d - 2\ell)\\
            &\geq d(d - 2\ell)\card{A}.
    \end{align*} 
    By the pigeonhole principle, there exists a vertex $a \in A$ such that 
    \[
        \card{V \rightarrow B \rightarrow \{a\}} \geq d(d-2\ell).
    \]

    Let $s$ be maximal such that there exists $S=\{b_1,\dots,b_s\}\subseteq N_B^-(a)$ and $Q=\{q_1,\dots,q_s\}\subseteq V\setminus (S\cup \{a\})$ with $(q_i,b_i)\in E$ for all $1\leq i\leq s$. Note that this gives a copy of $S^-_{2,s}$ in $G$. Since the in-degrees in $B$ are at most $2\ell$, we have 
    \[
        \card{V \rightarrow S \rightarrow \{a\}} \leq 2 \ell s,
    \]
    and consequently
    \[
        \card{V \rightarrow B\setminus S \rightarrow \{a\}} \geq  d(d-2\ell) - 2\ell s.
    \]
    By maximality of $s$, all these paths have their first vertex in $Q$.
    Hence, for some $1\leq i\leq s$ we have
    \[
        d=\deg^+(q_i)\geq \card{\{q_i\}\rightarrow B\setminus S \rightarrow \{a\}} \geq \frac{d(d-2\ell) - 2\ell s}{s},
    \]
    resulting in 
    \[
        s\geq \frac{d(d-2\ell)}{d+2\ell}.
    \]
    The last expression is greater than $\ell$ for $d>\left(\frac{3+\sqrt{17}}{2}\right)\ell$, since $\frac{3+\sqrt{17}}{2}$ is the positive root of the underlying quadratic equation. Thus, $G$ contains a copy of $\smtwol$.
