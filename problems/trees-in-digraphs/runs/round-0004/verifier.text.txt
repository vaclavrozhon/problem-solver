{"feedback_md":"The variable-threshold outstar-with-δ+-common-leaves scheme is now fully rigorous. The Γ-levels with thresholds t_{k−i}=ℓ^{i+1}+⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉ and base t_k=ℓ give S_{k,ℓ}=∑ t_i=Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k) without the linear-in-k loss. Both the lexicographic partition step and the depth-greedy extension are correct. Please standardize on the exact ℓ=2 closed form S_{k,2}=4·2^k−k−5 (Prover 2’s correction); earlier “−4−k” was off by 1.

This improves the already refined kℓ^{k+1} + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ by an additive kℓ; the “−1” at |V(B)| is also exact (w is in U but lies on all rays and should not be counted).

Process leaves in any order. For the current w, let U be the union of V(B) and the non-centre vertices of previously chosen S′(·). In S(w), every vertex other than w lies on exactly one ray, so the number of blocked rays is at most |U∩(V(S(w))\\{w})| ≤ |U|−1. Since at any step |U| ≤ |V(B)| + (|L|−1)·kℓ, it suffices to have h ≥ (|V(B)|−1)+(|L|−1)·kℓ+ℓ to ensure at least ℓ unblocked rays remain.
