The sum S_{k,\u2113} includes the base t_k, which is equal to \u2113. However, since the sum is over I, it may not include index 0 under certain patterns of z. We require \u03b4^+(G) to be greater than or equal to d(\u03a0) plus the sum of maxima. I'm wondering if we can reduce the additive constant by choosing a starting root in \u0393(k) without needing full thresholds for every index, but that seems unlikely.",

Let \u03a0 be \u03b4^+-common with threshold d(\u03a0). If G is a digraph and X \u2286 V(G) satisfies \u03b4^+(G) \u2265 d(\u03a0) + |X|, then there exists a vertex v \u2208 V(G)\\\\X that satisfies \u03a0 in G.\\n\\nProof. Removing X deletes at most |X| out-neighbours from each vertex, so \u03b4^+(G\u2212X) \u2265 \u03b4^+(G) \u2212 |X| \u2265 d(\u03a0). Hence G\u2212X contains a \u03a0-vertex y, and by anti-monotonicity y also satisfies \u03a0 in G. As y \u2208 V(G)\\\\X, we are done.\\n\\nWhy useful. In \u0393-layer and packing arguments we often exclude small forbidden sets (B and already chosen structures). Lemma 1 lets us guarantee \u03a0-vertices outside forbidden regions once the \u03b4^+ budget surpasses |X|.\\n\\nOutstar with \u03b4+-common leaves: exact variable thresholds\\n\\nTheorem 2 (variable thresholds; exact S_{k,\u2113}). Let \u03a0 be \u03b4^+-common with threshold d(\u03a0), and fix \u2113 \u2265 2, k \u2265 1. Define \u0393(0) = {\u03a0-vertices} and for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k\\n\u0393(j) = { v : deg^+_{\u0393(j\u22121)}(v) \u2265 t_j },\\nwith t_{k\u2212i} := \u2113^{i+1} + \u2308(\u2113^{i+1} \u2212 1)/(\u2113 \u2212 1)\u2309 for i = 0,\u2026,k\u22121 (thus t_k=\u2113). If\\n\u03b4^+(G) \u2265 d(\u03a0) + S_{k,\u2113}, where S_{k,\u2113} := \u2211_{j=1}^k t_j = \u2211_{r=1}^k (\u2113^r + \u2308(\u2113^r \u2212 1)/(\u2113 \u2212 1)\u2309),\\nthen G contains B \u2245 B^+_{k,\u2113} whose leaves all satisfy \u03a0.\\n\\nProof (sketch, fully checkable). The lexicographic partition argument from the paper works verbatim: assuming \u0393(k)=\u2205, the minimal nonempty class V_z forces deg^+_W(v) < \u2211_{j\u2208J} t_j \u2264 S_{k,\u2113} for v \u2208 V_z, with W = \u22c3_{j\u2208J} \u0393(j). If z \u2260 0\u20d7, this contradicts \u03b4^+(G) \u2265 S_{k,\u2113}; if z = 0\u20d7, then any v \u2208 X := V\\\\\u22c3_{j=0}^k \u0393(j) has deg^+_X(v) \u2265 \u03b4^+(G) \u2212 S_{k,\u2113} \u2265 d(\u03a0), giving a \u03a0-vertex in X, contradiction. Hence \u0393(k) \u2260 \u2205. Greedy extension from v \u2208 \u0393(k) works because at depth i the needed bound is exactly\\n|V(B_i)| + \u2113|L_i| = (\u2113^{i+1} \u2212 1)/(\u2113 \u2212 1) + \u2113^{i+1} = t_{k\u2212i},\\nso B_{i+1} exists with leaves in \u0393(k\u2212i\u22121), yielding B_k with leaves in \u0393(0).\\n\\nExact sum. Writing \u2308x\u2309 = x + \u03b5_r with 0 \u2264 \u03b5_r < 1,\\nS_{k,\u2113} = (\u2113^{k+1}\u2212\u2113)/(\u2113\u22121) + (\u2113^{k+1}\u2212\u2113)/(\u2113\u22121)^2 \u2212 k/(\u2113\u22121) + E_k,\\nwhere 0 \u2264 E_k < k. In particular S_{k,\u2113} = (\u2113^2/(\u2113\u22121)^2)\u00b7\u2113^k + O_\u2113(1), i.e. \u0398_\u2113(\u2113^k) without a factor k. For \u2113=2 we obtain the exact closed form\\nS_{k,2} = 4\u00b72^k \u2212 k \u2212 5.\\n\\nExact greedy ray packing and near-tightness\\n\\nLemma 3 (exact greedy ray packing). Let B \u2245 B^+_{k,\u2113} with leaves L (|L|=\u2113^k). For each w \u2208 L, let S(w) \u2245 S^-_{k,h} centred at w. If\\nh \u2265 (|V(B)| \u2212 1) + (|L| \u2212 1)\u00b7k\u2113 + \u2113 = k\u2113^{k+1} \u2212 k\u2113 + (\u2113^{k+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121) + \u2113,\\nthen there exist pairwise vertex-disjoint subcopies S\u2032(w) \u2245 S^-_{k,\u2113}, each intersecting B only at {w}.\\n\\nProof. Process leaves in any order. Let U be the union of B and already chosen S\u2032. Inside S(w), each u \u2208 U\\\\{w} lies on at most one ray; hence at most |U|\u22121 rays are blocked. At step m (0 \u2264 m \u2264 |L|\u22121), |U| \u2264 |V(B)| + m\u00b7k\u2113 + 1; thus at least h \u2212 (|V(B)| \u2212 1) \u2212 m\u00b7k\u2113 \u2265 \u2113 rays remain unblocked, enabling a choice of S\u2032(w).\\n\\nTightness example. Fix the last-processed leaf w. Arrange for all previously chosen S\u2032 to place their non-centre vertices on distinct rays of S(w) (feasible since h is large and S(w) has h rays). Together with |V(B)|\u22121 non-centre vertices of B, exactly (|V(B)| \u2212 1) + (|L| \u2212 1)\u00b7k\u2113 rays are blocked. If h < (|V(B)| \u2212 1) + (|L| \u2212 1)\u00b7k\u2113 + \u2113, at most \u2113\u22121 unblocked rays remain, so the greedy method fails. Thus the bound of Lemma 3 is best possible for the one-by-one greedy scheme.\\n\\nCorollary 4 (refined T(k,\u2113) threshold). With h* := k\u2113^{k+1} \u2212 k\u2113 + (\u2113^{k+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121) + \u2113 and S_{k,\u2113} as in Theorem 2, the condition \u03b4^+(G) \u2265 f(k,h*) + S_{k,\u2113} guarantees a copy of T(k,\u2113).\\n\\nProof. Take \u03a0 = \u201ccentre of S^-_{k,h*}\u201d. Theorem 2 gives B with leaves L all satisfying \u03a0; apply Lemma 3.\\n\\nk=2 spiders: repaired matching bound\\n\\nTheorem 5 (k=2). Any digraph with \u03b4^+(G)=d > d_*(\u2113) := ((3\u2113\u22121) + \u221a(17\u2113^2 \u2212 10\u2113 + 1))/2 contains S^-_{2,\u2113}.\\n\\nProof (outline). As in the paper, assume deg^+(v)=d, let A := {deg^\u2212 \u2265 2\u2113}, B := V\\\\A. If some r \u2208 A has deg^-_A(r) \u2265 2\u2113, embed greedily. Otherwise deg^-_A(\u00b7) \u2264 2\u2113\u22121 on A. Count 2-walks to A: |V \u21d2 B \u21d2 A| \u2265 |A| d(d\u22122\u2113+1). Pick a \u2208 A with T := |V \u21d2 B \u21d2 {a}| \u2265 d(d\u22122\u2113+1). Consider the predecessor bipartite graph H on (U,R) = (V\\\\{a}, N^-_B(a)), with q\u2014b iff (q,b) \u2208 E(G); then |E(H)| = T \u2212 deg^+_B(a) \u2265 d(d\u22122\u2113+1) \u2212 d. If s is a maximum matching size in H, K\u0151nig\u2019s theorem yields a vertex cover C of size s, so\\n|E(H)| \u2264 \u2211_{q\u2208C\u2229U} deg^+(q) + \u2211_{b\u2208C\u2229R} deg^\u2212(b) \u2264 d|C\u2229U| + (2\u2113\u22121)|C\u2229R| \u2264 (d+2\u2113\u22121)s.\\nThus s \u2265 (d(d\u22122\u2113))/ (d+2\u2113\u22121), and s \u2265 \u2113 holds when d > d_*(\u2113).\\n\\nMulti-property leaves\\n\\nObservation 6. If \u03a0_1,\u2026,\u03a0_r are \u03b4^+-common with thresholds d(\u03a0_i), then \u03a0 := (\u03a0_1 \u2228 \u22ef \u2228 \u03a0_r) is \u03b4^+-common with threshold d(\u03a0) \u2264 min_i d(\u03a0_i). Replacing \u0393(0) by \u22c3_{i} \u0393_i(0) in Theorem 2 yields a B^+_{k,\u2113} whose leaves each satisfies at least one \u03a0_i.\\n\\nConditional b-matching improvement (nibble-ready)\\n\\nProposition 7 (conditional per-level b-matching). At depth i, let H_i be the bipartite graph between L_i (|L_i|=\u2113^i) and R_i := \u0393(k\u2212i\u22121), with each w \u2208 L_i requiring \u2113 distinct neighbours. Suppose\\n- deg_{H_i}(w) \u2265 D_i for all w \u2208 L_i,\\n- maximum codegree (common neighbours) of any pair {w,w\u2032} on R_i is at most \u03bb_i,\\n- vertex degrees on R_i are bounded by \u0394_i,\\nwith D_i \u226b \u2113 and \u03bb_i \u226a D_i. Then a randomized nibble (Pippenger\u2013Spencer) yields w.h.p. a b-matching assigning \u2113 disjoint neighbours to each w, provided D_i \u2265 (1+\u03b5)\u2113 + c(\u221a(\u2113 log |L_i|) + \u03bb_i) for an absolute c.\\n\\nConsequence. Under such (pseudo)randomness, one can replace t_{k\u2212i} by (1+o(1))\u2113^{i+1}, reducing S_{k,\u2113} to (1+o_\u2113(1))\u00b7\u2113^k. Making this unconditional would require deriving codegree bounds \u03bb_i from the \u03b4^+-hypothesis, which is open.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\n- Exact S_{k,2}. With t_k=2 and t_{k\u2212i}=2^{i+2}\u22121 for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k\u22121, we have S_{k,2} = 2 + \u2211_{i=1}^{k\u22121}(2^{i+2}\u22121) = 2 + (8(2^{k\u22121}\u22121) \u2212 (k\u22121)) = 4\u00b72^k \u2212 k \u2212 5.\\n- Greedy ray-packing near-tightness is realized by arranging previously selected S\u2032 to occupy distinct rays in the current S(w); see the discussion after Lemma 3.\\n\\nObstacles\\n\\n- Without codegree control in the auxiliary bipartite graphs H_i, the greedy thresholds |V(B_i)| + \u2113|L_i| appear optimal for worst cases.\\n- Ray packing: the exact greedy bound is essentially tight; improvements need global packing across all S(w), a hypergraph matching problem requiring overlap control.\\n\\nNext steps\\n\\n- Attempt a \u0393-regularization step: from \u03b4^+(G) large, prune small exceptional sets to obtain R_i with bounded codegrees relative to L_i, enabling Proposition 7.\\n- Formulate ray packing as a flow/hypergraph matching instance, and seek sufficient Hall-type conditions to reduce h to (1+o(1))k\u2113^{k+1}.\\n- Explore k=3 via a two-layer predecessor flow/matching to obtain a linear threshold with constant c < 3.56; even a modest reduction would be a concrete advance.\\n\"}",
