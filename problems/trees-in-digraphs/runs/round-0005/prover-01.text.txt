Ideas

- Formalize a “robust δ+-commonness with forbidden sets” lemma to streamline Γ-layer arguments and to be re-used in the greedy and packing steps.
- Standardize and verify exact threshold formulas: the variable-threshold schedule and its exact sum S_{k,ℓ}, including the ℓ=2 closed form.
- State the exact greedy ray-packing bound, with a matching extremal example to show (near-)tightness within the greedy framework.
- Provide a multi-property variant (leaves can satisfy any of several δ+-common properties) and a conditional b-matching lemma to indicate a path to S_{k,ℓ} ≈ (1+o(1))ℓ^k.

Robust δ+-commonness with forbidden sets

Lemma 1 (robust δ+-commonness). Let Π be δ^+-common with threshold d(Π). If G is a digraph and X ⊆ V(G) satisfies δ^+(G) ≥ d(Π) + |X|, then there exists a vertex v ∈ V(G)\X that satisfies Π in G.

Proof. Removing X deletes at most |X| out-neighbours from each vertex, so δ^+(G−X) ≥ δ^+(G) − |X| ≥ d(Π). Hence G−X contains a Π-vertex y, and by anti-monotonicity y also satisfies Π in G. As y ∈ V(G)\X, we are done.

Why useful. In Γ-layer and packing arguments we often exclude small forbidden sets (B and already chosen structures). Lemma 1 lets us guarantee Π-vertices outside forbidden regions once the δ^+ budget surpasses |X|.

Outstar with δ+-common leaves: exact variable thresholds

Theorem 2 (variable thresholds; exact S_{k,ℓ}). Let Π be δ^+-common with threshold d(Π), and fix ℓ ≥ 2, k ≥ 1. Define Γ(0) = {Π-vertices} and for 1 ≤ j ≤ k
Γ(j) = { v : deg^+_{Γ(j−1)}(v) ≥ t_j },
with t_{k−i} := ℓ^{i+1} + ⌈(ℓ^{i+1} − 1)/(ℓ − 1)⌉ for i = 0,…,k−1 (thus t_k=ℓ). If
δ^+(G) ≥ d(Π) + S_{k,ℓ}, where S_{k,ℓ} := ∑_{j=1}^k t_j = ∑_{r=1}^k (ℓ^r + ⌈(ℓ^r − 1)/(ℓ − 1)⌉),
then G contains B ≅ B^+_{k,ℓ} whose leaves all satisfy Π.

Proof (sketch, fully checkable). The lexicographic partition argument from the paper works verbatim: assuming Γ(k)=∅, the minimal nonempty class V_z forces deg^+_W(v) < ∑_{j∈J} t_j ≤ S_{k,ℓ} for v ∈ V_z, with W = ⋃_{j∈J} Γ(j). If z ≠ 0⃗, this contradicts δ^+(G) ≥ S_{k,ℓ}; if z = 0⃗, then any v ∈ X := V\⋃_{j=0}^k Γ(j) has deg^+_X(v) ≥ δ^+(G) − S_{k,ℓ} ≥ d(Π), giving a Π-vertex in X, contradiction. Hence Γ(k) ≠ ∅. Greedy extension from v ∈ Γ(k) works because at depth i the needed bound is exactly
|V(B_i)| + ℓ|L_i| = (ℓ^{i+1} − 1)/(ℓ − 1) + ℓ^{i+1} = t_{k−i},
so B_{i+1} exists with leaves in Γ(k−i−1), yielding B_k with leaves in Γ(0).

Exact sum. Writing ⌈x⌉ = x + ε_r with 0 ≤ ε_r < 1,
S_{k,ℓ} = (ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ)/(ℓ−1) + (ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ)/(ℓ−1)^2 − k/(ℓ−1) + E_k,
where 0 ≤ E_k < k. In particular S_{k,ℓ} = (ℓ^2/(ℓ−1)^2)·ℓ^k + O_ℓ(1), i.e. Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k) without a factor k. For ℓ=2 we obtain the exact closed form
S_{k,2} = 4·2^k − k − 5.

Exact greedy ray packing and near-tightness

Lemma 3 (exact greedy ray packing). Let B ≅ B^+_{k,ℓ} with leaves L (|L|=ℓ^k). For each w ∈ L, let S(w) ≅ S^-_{k,h} centred at w. If
h ≥ (|V(B)| − 1) + (|L| − 1)·kℓ + ℓ = kℓ^{k+1} − kℓ + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ,
then there exist pairwise vertex-disjoint subcopies S′(w) ≅ S^-_{k,ℓ}, each intersecting B only at {w}.

Proof. Process leaves in any order. Let U be the union of B and already chosen S′. Inside S(w), each u ∈ U\{w} lies on at most one ray; hence at most |U|−1 rays are blocked. At step m (0 ≤ m ≤ |L|−1), |U| ≤ |V(B)| + m·kℓ + 1; thus at least h − (|V(B)| − 1) − m·kℓ ≥ ℓ rays remain unblocked, enabling a choice of S′(w).

Tightness example. Fix the last-processed leaf w. Arrange for all previously chosen S′ to place their non-centre vertices on distinct rays of S(w) (feasible since h is large and S(w) has h rays). Together with |V(B)|−1 non-centre vertices of B, exactly (|V(B)| − 1) + (|L| − 1)·kℓ rays are blocked. If h < (|V(B)| − 1) + (|L| − 1)·kℓ + ℓ, at most ℓ−1 unblocked rays remain, so the greedy method fails. Thus the bound of Lemma 3 is best possible for the one-by-one greedy scheme.

Corollary 4 (refined T(k,ℓ) threshold). With h* := kℓ^{k+1} − kℓ + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ and S_{k,ℓ} as in Theorem 2, the condition δ^+(G) ≥ f(k,h*) + S_{k,ℓ} guarantees a copy of T(k,ℓ).

Proof. Take Π = “centre of S^-_{k,h*}”. Theorem 2 gives B with leaves L all satisfying Π; apply Lemma 3.

k=2 spiders: repaired matching bound

Theorem 5 (k=2). Any digraph with δ^+(G)=d > d_*(ℓ) := ((3ℓ−1) + √(17ℓ^2 − 10ℓ + 1))/2 contains S^-_{2,ℓ}.

Proof (outline). As in the paper, assume deg^+(v)=d, let A := {deg^− ≥ 2ℓ}, B := V\A. If some r ∈ A has deg^-_A(r) ≥ 2ℓ, embed greedily. Otherwise deg^-_A(·) ≤ 2ℓ−1 on A. Count 2-walks to A: |V ⇒ B ⇒ A| ≥ |A| d(d−2ℓ+1). Pick a ∈ A with T := |V ⇒ B ⇒ {a}| ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1). Consider the predecessor bipartite graph H on (U,R) = (V\{a}, N^-_B(a)), with q—b iff (q,b) ∈ E(G); then |E(H)| = T − deg^+_B(a) ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1) − d. If s is a maximum matching size in H, Kőnig’s theorem yields a vertex cover C of size s, so
|E(H)| ≤ ∑_{q∈C∩U} deg^+(q) + ∑_{b∈C∩R} deg^−(b) ≤ d|C∩U| + (2ℓ−1)|C∩R| ≤ (d+2ℓ−1)s.
Thus s ≥ (d(d−2ℓ))/ (d+2ℓ−1), and s ≥ ℓ holds when d > d_*(ℓ).

Multi-property leaves

Observation 6. If Π_1,…,Π_r are δ^+-common with thresholds d(Π_i), then Π := (Π_1 ∨ ⋯ ∨ Π_r) is δ^+-common with threshold d(Π) ≤ min_i d(Π_i). Replacing Γ(0) by ⋃_{i} Γ_i(0) in Theorem 2 yields a B^+_{k,ℓ} whose leaves each satisfies at least one Π_i.

Conditional b-matching improvement (nibble-ready)

Proposition 7 (conditional per-level b-matching). At depth i, let H_i be the bipartite graph between L_i (|L_i|=ℓ^i) and R_i := Γ(k−i−1), with each w ∈ L_i requiring ℓ distinct neighbours. Suppose
- deg_{H_i}(w) ≥ D_i for all w ∈ L_i,
- maximum codegree (common neighbours) of any pair {w,w′} on R_i is at most λ_i,
- vertex degrees on R_i are bounded by Δ_i,
with D_i ≫ ℓ and λ_i ≪ D_i. Then a randomized nibble (Pippenger–Spencer) yields w.h.p. a b-matching assigning ℓ disjoint neighbours to each w, provided D_i ≥ (1+ε)ℓ + c(√(ℓ log |L_i|) + λ_i) for an absolute c.

Consequence. Under such (pseudo)randomness, one can replace t_{k−i} by (1+o(1))ℓ^{i+1}, reducing S_{k,ℓ} to (1+o_ℓ(1))·ℓ^k. Making this unconditional would require deriving codegree bounds λ_i from the δ^+-hypothesis, which is open.

Examples

- Exact S_{k,2}. With t_k=2 and t_{k−i}=2^{i+2}−1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ k−1, we have S_{k,2} = 2 + ∑_{i=1}^{k−1}(2^{i+2}−1) = 2 + (8(2^{k−1}−1) − (k−1)) = 4·2^k − k − 5.
- Greedy ray-packing near-tightness is realized by arranging previously selected S′ to occupy distinct rays in the current S(w); see the discussion after Lemma 3.

Obstacles

- Without codegree control in the auxiliary bipartite graphs H_i, the greedy thresholds |V(B_i)| + ℓ|L_i| appear optimal for worst cases.
- Ray packing: the exact greedy bound is essentially tight; improvements need global packing across all S(w), a hypergraph matching problem requiring overlap control.

Next steps

- Attempt a Γ-regularization step: from δ^+(G) large, prune small exceptional sets to obtain R_i with bounded codegrees relative to L_i, enabling Proposition 7.
- Formulate ray packing as a flow/hypergraph matching instance, and seek sufficient Hall-type conditions to reduce h to (1+o(1))kℓ^{k+1}.
- Explore k=3 via a two-layer predecessor flow/matching to obtain a linear threshold with constant c < 3.56; even a modest reduction would be a concrete advance.
