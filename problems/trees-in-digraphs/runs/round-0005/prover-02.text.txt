# Ideas

We provide two rigorous, incremental refinements and one tightness construction that clarify optimality (within the greedy framework) and help standardize constants for curation.

- Robust δ+-commonness with forbidden sets: a simple lemma that formalizes how to avoid a pre-specified set when invoking a δ+-common property. Useful for keeping embeddings disjoint without re-deriving thresholds.
- Tightness (within the greedy method) of the variable-threshold schedule at each depth: an explicit obstruction family showing the per-depth condition deg_{Γ(k−i−1)}(w) ≥ |V(B_i)| + ℓ^{i+1} is essentially best possible up to an additive ±1 term.
- Sanity checks and exact constants: confirm the exact formula S_{k,2}=4·2^k−k−5 and the exact greedy ray-packing height h ≥ (|V(B)|−1)+(|L|−1)·kℓ+ℓ, and present the ℓ=2 specialization.

# Lemma: Robust δ+-commonness with forbidden sets

Statement. Let P be a δ^+-common property with threshold d(P) (anti-monotone). Let G be a digraph with δ^+(G) ≥ d(P)+m and F⊆V(G) with |F|≤m. Then there exists a vertex v∉F that satisfies P in G.

Proof. Consider H=G[V\F]. For every u∈V(H), deg^+_H(u) ≥ deg^+_G(u) − |F| ≥ δ^+(G) − |F| ≥ d(P). Hence δ^+(H) ≥ d(P). By δ^+-commonness, H contains a vertex x satisfying P in H. By anti-monotonicity of P, x satisfies P in G. Also x∈V(H)=V\F, so x∉F. ∎

Why useful here. This encapsulates the “avoid previously used vertices” step when invoking a δ^+-common property (e.g., the centre of S^-_{k,h}) and allows adding a clean +|F| buffer to degree thresholds instead of re-deriving ad hoc avoidance.

# Tightness of the per-depth threshold in the outstar-with-leaves construction

Claim (Near-optimality up to ±1). Fix i∈{0,…,k−1}. For the depth-i extension step, any purely greedy scheme that requires each leaf w∈L (|L|=ℓ^i) to pick ℓ distinct children in Γ(k−i−1) disjoint from V(B_i) and across different w’s, cannot, in general, succeed if one only assumes

    deg^+_{Γ(k−i−1)}(w) ≥ ℓ^{i+1} + |V(B_i)| − 1.

Equivalently, the sufficient condition

    deg^+_{Γ(k−i−1)}(w) ≥ ℓ^{i+1} + |V(B_i)|

is essentially tight up to an additive ±1.

Construction. Let U denote V(B_i). Let C be a set of size |C|=ℓ^{i+1}−1. Set Γ(k−i−1)=U∪C. For every leaf w∈L, define N^+_{Γ(k−i−1)}(w)=Γ(k−i−1) (so deg^+_{Γ(k−i−1)}(w)=|U|+|C|=|V(B_i)|+ℓ^{i+1}−1). Any valid depth-(i+1) extension must choose ℓ·|L|=ℓ^{i+1} distinct new children, all inside Γ(k−i−1)\U=C, but |C|=ℓ^{i+1}−1 is too small. Thus, failure occurs at the threshold |V(B_i)|+ℓ^{i+1}−1, showing the +|V(B_i)|+ℓ^{i+1} bound is tight to within +1.

Comment. This validates the level-dependent schedule t_{k−i}=ℓ^{i+1}+⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉ in Theorem A as essentially best-possible for the greedy layer-by-layer method (the ⌈·⌉ term is |V(B_i)|).

# Exact constants and checks

- Exact S_{k,2}. With t_k=2 and t_{k−i}=2^{i+2}−1 for 1≤i≤k−1,
  
  S_{k,2} = 2 + ∑_{i=1}^{k−1}(2^{i+2}−1) = 2^{k+2} − k − 5 = 4·2^k − k − 5.
  
  This matches and standardizes the ℓ=2 case.
- Exact greedy ray-packing height. For B≅B^+_{k,ℓ} with |V(B)|=(ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) and |L|=ℓ^k, the one-by-one greedy selection of S′(w)⊆S(w) (w∈L) succeeds if
  
  h ≥ (|V(B)|−1) + (|L|−1)·kℓ + ℓ
  
  i.e.
  
  h ≥ kℓ^{k+1} − kℓ + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ.
  
  For ℓ=2 this specializes to h ≥ (k+1)·2^{k+1} − 2k.

# Short audit for k=2 matching bound (no change in constant)

When passing from t=|V→B→{a}| to edges in the predecessor bipartite graph H=(V\{a}, N^-_B(a); E), one must subtract the 2-walks starting at a, i.e., t′=t−deg^+_B(a) (with deg^+_B(a)≤d). This yields

    s ≥ [ (d−1)(d−2ℓ+1) − d ] / (d+2ℓ−2) ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1)/(d+2ℓ−1),

hence δ^+ > ((3ℓ−1)+√(17ℓ^2−10ℓ+1))/2 suffices, as in the curated version. Any claim omitting the −deg^+_B(a) correction is invalid.

# Examples

- Depth thresholds (ℓ=3, k=4): |V(B_1)|=1+3=4, |V(B_2)|=1+3+9=13, |V(B_3)|=1+3+9+27=40. Thus t_4=3, t_3=9+4=13, t_2=27+13=40, t_1=81+40=121. Sum S_{4,3}=177, while the paper’s uniform 2kℓ^k=2·4·3^4=648 is much larger.
- Ray packing (ℓ=3, k=3): |V(B)|=(3^4−1)/2=40, |L|=27; h ≥ (40−1)+(27−1)·3·3+3 = 39 + 26·9 + 3 = 39 + 234 + 3 = 276, versus 3kℓ^{k+1}=3·3·3^4=729 previously.

# Obstacles

- The true bottleneck remains f(k,h) for S^-_{k,h}. Any polynomial-in-h bound for fixed k would decisively lower the δ^+ thresholds in T(k,ℓ) embeddings.
- The tightness construction shows that, within the one-by-one greedy layer extension, replacing |V(B_i)| by a substantially smaller term is impossible in general.

# Next steps

- Per-depth global b-matching/nibble: Try to replace the |V(B_i)| overhead by o(ℓ^{i+1}) via a Hall/LLL argument across all leaves at depth i, aiming for S_{k,ℓ}=(1+o_ℓ(1))·C(ℓ)·ℓ^k.
- Globalize ray packing: Model the choice of rays across all S(w) as a hypergraph matching problem to target h=(1+o(1))kℓ^{k+1}.
- Seek polynomial-in-h bounds for f(k,h) (k fixed) via expansion layering and pruning; even h^{O(k)} would materially strengthen the main quantitative theorem.
