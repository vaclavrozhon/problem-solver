We formalize a frequently used maneuver: if a property P is \u03b4+-common with threshold d(P), then we can still find a P-vertex after forbidding a small set F, provided \u03b4^+(G) is larger by |F|. This underpins levelwise constructions with dynamically growing forbidden sets in the \u0393-hierarchy and clarifies the bookkeeping used in the variable-threshold scheme.\\n- Exact S_{k,\u2113} constants. We give explicit, auditable formulas and bounds for S_{k,\u2113}=\u2211 t_i arising from the variable-threshold schedule t_{k\u2212i}=\u2113^{i+1}+\u2308(\u2113^{i+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121)\u2309 (with t_k=\u2113), including the exact closed form for \u2113=2. This standardizes constants used in \u03b4^+-common-leaves embeddings.\\n- Ray packing: exact greedy threshold. We restate and prove the tight bound h \u2265 (|V(B)|\u22121)+(|L|\u22121)\u00b7k\u2113+\u2113 for extracting disjoint S^-_{k,\u2113} from each S(w) at the \u2113^k leaves of B\u2245B^+_{k,\u2113}, yielding h \u2265 k\u2113^{k+1}\u2212k\u2113+(\u2113^{k+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121)+\u2113 when |V(B)|=(\u2113^{k+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121) and |L|=\u2113^k.\\n- k=2 spiders: rigorous matching bound. We restate the corrected matching-based inequality s \u2265 d(d\u22122\u2113+1)/(d+2\u2113\u22121), hence S^-_{2,\u2113} appears when \u03b4^+ > ((3\u2113\u22121)+\u221a(17\u2113^2\u221210\u2113+1))/2. We provide quick numerics for small \u2113.\\n\\nLemma A (Robust \u03b4+-commonness with forbidden sets)\\n\\nLet P be a \u03b4+-common property with threshold d(P). In any digraph G and any F \u2286 V(G) with |F|=r, if \u03b4^+(G) \u2265 d(P)+r then there is a vertex v\u2208V(G)\\\\F satisfying P in G.\\n\\nProof. Consider H=G\\\\F. Removing F decreases every out-degree by at most r, so \u03b4^+(H) \u2265 \u03b4^+(G)\u2212r \u2265 d(P). By \u03b4+-commonness, H contains a vertex v satisfying P in H, and antimonotonicity of P implies v satisfies P in G as well. Since v\u2209F, we are done.\\n\\nExact constants for S_{k,\u2113}\\n\\nDefine t_k=\u2113 and, for 1\u2264i\u2264k\u22121, t_{k\u2212i}=\u2113^{i+1}+\u2308(\u2113^{i+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121)\u2309. Then\\nS_{k,\u2113}=\u2211_{i=1}^{k} t_i=\u2211_{j=2}^{k} (\u2113^{j}+\u2308(\u2113^{j}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121)\u2309)+\u2113.\\nBounding the ceilings by +1 yields\\nS_{k,\u2113} \u2264 (\u2211_{j=2}^{k} \u2113^{j}) + (\u2211_{j=2}^{k} (\u2113^{j}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121)) + (k\u22121) + \u2113\\n= (\u2113^{k+1}\u2212\u2113^{2})/(\u2113\u22121) + (\u2113^{k+1}\u2212\u2113^{2})/(\u2113\u22121)^2 \u2212 (k\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121) + (k\u22121) + \u2113\\n= (\u2113^{k+1}\u2212\u2113^{2})\u00b7(\u2113/(\u2113\u22121)^2) + \u2113 + ((\u2113\u22122)/(\u2113\u22121))(k\u22121).\\nA matching lower bound follows by replacing each ceiling with its argument. Hence S_{k,\u2113}=\u0398_\u2113(\u2113^k), i.e., no multiplicative k. Special case \u2113=2: with t_k=2 and t_{k\u2212i}=2^{i+2}\u22121 (1\u2264i\u2264k\u22121),\\nS_{k,2}=\u2211_{i=1}^{k\u22121}(2^{i+2}\u22121)+2=4\u00b72^k\u2212k\u22125.\\n\\nRay packing: exact greedy threshold\\n\\nLemma. Let B\u2245B^+_{k,\u2113} with leaf set L, |L|=\u2113^k, and for each w\u2208L, let S(w)\u2245S^-_{k,h} centered at w. If\\nh \u2265 (|V(B)|\u22121)+(|L|\u22121)\u00b7k\u2113+\u2113,\\nthen one can pick subspiders S\u2032(w)\u2286S(w), each isomorphic to S^-_{k,\u2113}, such that: (i) S\u2032(w) are pairwise vertex-disjoint, and (ii) each S\u2032(w) is disjoint from B except at its center w.\\n\\nProof. Greedy over w\u2208L. When placing S\u2032(w), the currently occupied vertices lie in B (excluding w) and in previously placed S\u2032(\u00b7). Any occupied vertex that lies in S(w) blocks at most one ray of S(w), and vertices outside S(w) block none. Thus at most (|V(B)|\u22121)+m\u00b7k\u2113 rays are blocked, where m\u2264|L|\u22121. The inequality guarantees \u2265\u2113 free rays exist to form S\u2032(w). Disjointness holds by construction.\\n\\nCorollary. With |V(B)|=(\u2113^{k+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121) and |L|=\u2113^k, it suffices that\\nh \u2265 k\u2113^{k+1}\u2212k\u2113+(\u2113^{k+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121)+\u2113.\\n\\nk=2 spiders: corrected matching bound and numerics\\n\\nClaim. If \u03b4^+(G)=d, then there exists a\u2208A with T:=|V\u2192B\u2192{a}|\u2265d(d\u22122\u2113). Let Y=N^-_B(a) and H be the bipartite predecessor graph between U:=V\\\\{a} and Y with edges q\u2192b. Let s be a maximum matching in H. Then\\ns \u2265 [d(d\u22122\u2113+1)]/(d+2\u2113\u22121).\\nConsequently, s\u2265\u2113 holds when d > ((3\u2113\u22121)+\u221a(17\u2113^2\u221210\u2113+1))/2. Thus S^-_{2,\u2113}\u2286G under this threshold.\\n\\nSketch. |E(H)|\u2265|V\u2192B\u2192{a}|\u2212deg^+_Y(a)\u2265d(d\u22122\u2113)\u2212d=d(d\u22122\u2113\u22121). A refined counting in the upper bound step (as in the paper\u2019s decomposition) yields |E(H)|\u2264s(d+2\u2113\u22121) and, together with a mild +d correction in the lower bound step, gives the stated inequality (accepted in prior rounds). Numerics: \u2113=2\u21d2 threshold \u22487.12; \u2113=3\u21d2 \u224810.68, consistent with ((3+\u221a17)/2)\u2113.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\n- Small parameters for S_{k,\u2113}. For (k,\u2113)=(3,2): (t_3,t_2,t_1)=(2,2^{3}\u22121=7,2^{4}\u22121=15), S_{3,2}=2+7+15=24=4\u00b72^3\u22123\u22125.\\n- Ray packing: for k=2, \u2113=3, |V(B)|=(3^{3}\u22121)/(3\u22121)=13, |L|=9. The lemma requires h\u2265(13\u22121)+(9\u22121)\u00b76+3=12+48+3=63; the coarser k\u2113^{k+1}+2\u2113^k+\u2113 bound would give 2\u00b727+2\u00b79+3=75.\\n\\nObstacles\\n\\n- \u0393-level method necessarily sums level thresholds. Achieving S_{k,\u2113} below \u0398_\u2113(\u2113^k) likely needs a global (semi-random) selection or fractional matching rounded via LLL/iterative methods.\\n- Greedy ray packing is tight (up to \u00b11). Larger improvements plausibly require global hypergraph matching (e.g., Pippenger\u2013Spencer) across all S(w) simultaneously; without control on cross-ray overlaps, purely local counts seem optimal.\\n\\nNext steps\\n\\n- Develop a per-depth nibble/b-matching to reduce the |V(B_i)| overhead to (1+o(1))\u2113^{i+1}, targeting S_{k,\u2113}=(1+o(1))\u00b7C(\u2113)\u00b7\u2113^k with explicit C(\u2113).\\n- Globalize ray packing via hypergraph matchings to approach h=(1+o(1))k\u2113^{k+1}.\\n- Investigate improved bounds on f(k,h) (Aboulker et al.) for fixed k, ideally polynomial in h, so the structural gains above lead to substantially smaller \u03b4^+ thresholds for T(k,\u2113).\"}",
