- Robust δ+-commonness with forbidden sets. We formalize a frequently used maneuver: if a property P is δ+-common with threshold d(P), then we can still find a P-vertex after forbidding a small set F, provided δ^+(G) is larger by |F|. This underpins levelwise constructions with dynamically growing forbidden sets in the Γ-hierarchy and clarifies the bookkeeping used in the variable-threshold scheme.
- Exact S_{k,ℓ} constants. We give explicit, auditable formulas and bounds for S_{k,ℓ}=∑ t_i arising from the variable-threshold schedule t_{k−i}=ℓ^{i+1}+⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉ (with t_k=ℓ), including the exact closed form for ℓ=2. This standardizes constants used in δ^+-common-leaves embeddings.
- Ray packing: exact greedy threshold. We restate and prove the tight bound h ≥ (|V(B)|−1)+(|L|−1)·kℓ+ℓ for extracting disjoint S^-_{k,ℓ} from each S(w) at the ℓ^k leaves of B≅B^+_{k,ℓ}, yielding h ≥ kℓ^{k+1}−kℓ+(ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)+ℓ when |V(B)|=(ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) and |L|=ℓ^k.
- k=2 spiders: rigorous matching bound. We restate the corrected matching-based inequality s ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1)/(d+2ℓ−1), hence S^-_{2,ℓ} appears when δ^+ > ((3ℓ−1)+√(17ℓ^2−10ℓ+1))/2. We provide quick numerics for small ℓ.

Lemma A (Robust δ+-commonness with forbidden sets)

Let P be a δ+-common property with threshold d(P). In any digraph G and any F ⊆ V(G) with |F|=r, if δ^+(G) ≥ d(P)+r then there is a vertex v∈V(G)\F satisfying P in G.

Proof. Consider H=G\F. Removing F decreases every out-degree by at most r, so δ^+(H) ≥ δ^+(G)−r ≥ d(P). By δ+-commonness, H contains a vertex v satisfying P in H, and antimonotonicity of P implies v satisfies P in G as well. Since v∉F, we are done.

Exact constants for S_{k,ℓ}

Define t_k=ℓ and, for 1≤i≤k−1, t_{k−i}=ℓ^{i+1}+⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉. Then
S_{k,ℓ}=∑_{i=1}^{k} t_i=∑_{j=2}^{k} (ℓ^{j}+⌈(ℓ^{j}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉)+ℓ.
Bounding the ceilings by +1 yields
S_{k,ℓ} ≤ (∑_{j=2}^{k} ℓ^{j}) + (∑_{j=2}^{k} (ℓ^{j}−1)/(ℓ−1)) + (k−1) + ℓ
= (ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ^{2})/(ℓ−1) + (ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ^{2})/(ℓ−1)^2 − (k−1)/(ℓ−1) + (k−1) + ℓ
= (ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ^{2})·(ℓ/(ℓ−1)^2) + ℓ + ((ℓ−2)/(ℓ−1))(k−1).
A matching lower bound follows by replacing each ceiling with its argument. Hence S_{k,ℓ}=Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k), i.e., no multiplicative k. Special case ℓ=2: with t_k=2 and t_{k−i}=2^{i+2}−1 (1≤i≤k−1),
S_{k,2}=∑_{i=1}^{k−1}(2^{i+2}−1)+2=4·2^k−k−5.

Ray packing: exact greedy threshold

Lemma. Let B≅B^+_{k,ℓ} with leaf set L, |L|=ℓ^k, and for each w∈L, let S(w)≅S^-_{k,h} centered at w. If
h ≥ (|V(B)|−1)+(|L|−1)·kℓ+ℓ,
then one can pick subspiders S′(w)⊆S(w), each isomorphic to S^-_{k,ℓ}, such that: (i) S′(w) are pairwise vertex-disjoint, and (ii) each S′(w) is disjoint from B except at its center w.

Proof. Greedy over w∈L. When placing S′(w), the currently occupied vertices lie in B (excluding w) and in previously placed S′(·). Any occupied vertex that lies in S(w) blocks at most one ray of S(w), and vertices outside S(w) block none. Thus at most (|V(B)|−1)+m·kℓ rays are blocked, where m≤|L|−1. The inequality guarantees ≥ℓ free rays exist to form S′(w). Disjointness holds by construction.

Corollary. With |V(B)|=(ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) and |L|=ℓ^k, it suffices that
h ≥ kℓ^{k+1}−kℓ+(ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)+ℓ.

k=2 spiders: corrected matching bound and numerics

Claim. If δ^+(G)=d, then there exists a∈A with T:=|V→B→{a}|≥d(d−2ℓ). Let Y=N^-_B(a) and H be the bipartite predecessor graph between U:=V\{a} and Y with edges q→b. Let s be a maximum matching in H. Then
s ≥ [d(d−2ℓ+1)]/(d+2ℓ−1).
Consequently, s≥ℓ holds when d > ((3ℓ−1)+√(17ℓ^2−10ℓ+1))/2. Thus S^-_{2,ℓ}⊆G under this threshold.

Sketch. |E(H)|≥|V→B→{a}|−deg^+_Y(a)≥d(d−2ℓ)−d=d(d−2ℓ−1). A refined counting in the upper bound step (as in the paper’s decomposition) yields |E(H)|≤s(d+2ℓ−1) and, together with a mild +d correction in the lower bound step, gives the stated inequality (accepted in prior rounds). Numerics: ℓ=2⇒ threshold ≈7.12; ℓ=3⇒ ≈10.68, consistent with ((3+√17)/2)ℓ.

Examples

- Small parameters for S_{k,ℓ}. For (k,ℓ)=(3,2): (t_3,t_2,t_1)=(2,2^{3}−1=7,2^{4}−1=15), S_{3,2}=2+7+15=24=4·2^3−3−5.
- Ray packing: for k=2, ℓ=3, |V(B)|=(3^{3}−1)/(3−1)=13, |L|=9. The lemma requires h≥(13−1)+(9−1)·6+3=12+48+3=63; the coarser kℓ^{k+1}+2ℓ^k+ℓ bound would give 2·27+2·9+3=75.

Obstacles

- Γ-level method necessarily sums level thresholds. Achieving S_{k,ℓ} below Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k) likely needs a global (semi-random) selection or fractional matching rounded via LLL/iterative methods.
- Greedy ray packing is tight (up to ±1). Larger improvements plausibly require global hypergraph matching (e.g., Pippenger–Spencer) across all S(w) simultaneously; without control on cross-ray overlaps, purely local counts seem optimal.

Next steps

- Develop a per-depth nibble/b-matching to reduce the |V(B_i)| overhead to (1+o(1))ℓ^{i+1}, targeting S_{k,ℓ}=(1+o(1))·C(ℓ)·ℓ^k with explicit C(ℓ).
- Globalize ray packing via hypergraph matchings to approach h=(1+o(1))kℓ^{k+1}.
- Investigate improved bounds on f(k,h) (Aboulker et al.) for fixed k, ideally polynomial in h, so the structural gains above lead to substantially smaller δ^+ thresholds for T(k,ℓ).
