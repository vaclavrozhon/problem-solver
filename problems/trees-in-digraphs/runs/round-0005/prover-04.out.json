For \u2113\u22652, k\u22651, with the schedule t_k=\u2113 and t_{k\u2212j}=\u2113^{j+1}+\u2308(\u2113^{j+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121)\u2309 for 1\u2264j\u2264k\u22121,\nS_{k,\u2113}:=\u2211_{i=1}^k t_i = \u2113 + \u2211_{j=1}^{k\u22121} \u2113^{j+1} + \u2211_{j=1}^{k\u22121} \u2308(\u2113^{j+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121)\u2309.\nIn particular,\nS_{k,\u2113} \u2264 \u2113 + (\u2113(\u2113^k\u2212\u2113))/(\u2113\u22121) + (\u2113(\u2113^k\u2212\u2113))/(\u2113\u22121)^2 + (k\u22121)\n= (\u2113^2/(\u2113\u22121)^2)\u00b7\u2113^k + O_\u2113(1) + O(k) = \u0398_\u2113(\u2113^k).\nFor \u2113=2 one has t_{k\u2212j}=2^{j+2}\u22121 (1\u2264j\u2264k\u22121) and t_k=2, hence the exact closed form\nS_{k,2} = 2 + \u2211_{j=1}^{k\u22121}(2^{j+2}\u22121) = 4\u00b72^k \u2212 k \u2212 5.\n\nProof. Direct summation; use \u2308x\u2309\u2264x+1 and the geometric series. The \u2113=2 expression follows from the identity \u2211_{j=1}^{k\u22121}2^{j+2}=2^{k+2}\u22128.\n\nLemma 2 (robust \u03b4+-commonness with forbidden sets). Let P be a \u03b4+-common property with threshold d(P). For a fixed F\u2286V(G), define P_F(v):=\u201cv satisfies P in G\u2212F.\u201d Then P_F is \u03b4+-common with threshold d(P)+|F| and P_F\u21d2P.\n\nProof. If \u03b4^+(G)\u2265d(P)+|F|, then \u03b4^+(G\u2212F)\u2265d(P), so G\u2212F contains a vertex v with P. Since P is anti-monotone, v also has P in G. Thus P_F is \u03b4+-common with threshold d(P)+|F| and P_F implies P.\n\nCorollary 2.1 (clean integration into T(k,\u2113)). In Theorem \u201coutstar-with-\u03b4+-common-leaves,\u201d when P is \u201ccenter of S^-_{k,h}\u201d and F is the current forbidden set (B plus previously chosen rays), Lemma 2 permits invoking \u03b4+-commonness directly in G\u2212F with threshold f(k,h)+|F|, justifying the precise greedy ray-packing bound below.\n\nProposition 3 (exact greedy ray-packing threshold). Let B\u2245B^+_{k,\u2113} be embedded with leaf set L (|L|=\u2113^k). Suppose each w\u2208L is the center of a copy S(w)\u2245S^-_{k,h}. If\nh \u2265 (|V(B)|\u22121) + (|L|\u22121)\u00b7k\u2113 + \u2113,\nthen there exist pairwise vertex-disjoint subspiders S\u2032(w)\u2245S^-_{k,\u2113} such that S\u2032(w)\u2229B={w}.\n\nProof. When choosing S\u2032(w), the forbidden set F comprises V(B)\\{w} and the non-centers already used in S\u2032(w\u2032), w\u2032\u2260w. Each non-center lies on exactly one ray of S(w), so F blocks at most |F| rays. With |F| \u2264 (|V(B)|\u22121) + (|L|\u22121)\u00b7k\u2113, there remain at least h\u2212|F|\u2265\u2113 rays, so S\u2032(w) exists. Greedy over w\u2208L.\n\nRemark. With |V(B)|=(\u2113^{k+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121) and |L|=\u2113^k, this yields\nh \u2265 k\u2113^{k+1} \u2212 k\u2113 + (\u2113^{k+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121) + \u2113,\nwhich strictly improves earlier k\u2113^{k+1}+2\u2113^k+\u2113 and k\u2113^{k+1} + (\u2113^{k+1}\u22121)/(\u2113\u22121) + \u2113.\n\nProposition 4 (k=2, parameterized A/B threshold; optimal choice). Fix t\u22652\u2113 and define A={v:deg^\u2212(v)\u2265t}, B=V\\A. Assume all out-degrees equal d. If no r\u2208A has deg^\u2212_A(r)\u22652\u2113, then there exists a\u2208A such that the maximum matching size s between L:=V\\{a} and R:=N^-_B(a) in the predecessor bipartite graph H satisfies\ns \u2265 (d(d\u2212t) \u2212 d)/(d + t \u2212 1).\nConsequently, S^-_{2,\u2113} exists provided d solves d(d\u2212t)\u2212d > \u2113(d+t\u22121).\nIn the asymptotic regime d=c\u2113, t=a\u2113 (a\u22652), this inequality reads c^2 \u2212 (a+1)c \u2212 a > 0, minimized at a=2, i.e. c \u2265 (3+\u221a17)/2. Hence t=2\u2113 is optimal within this method.\n\nProof. Same 2-walk counting template as in the paper, replacing 2\u2113 by t. The predecessor-graph correction |E(H)|=|V\u2192B\u2192{a}|\u2212deg^+_B(a)\u2265d(d\u2212t)\u2212d and |E(H)|\u2264(d+t\u22121)s yield the claimed bound on s.\n\nLower-bound constructions and near-tightness\n\n- Necessity of the \u2113^{i+1} component in t_{k\u2212i}. For fixed i, construct disjoint sets L (|L|=\u2113^i) and R (|R|=\u2113^{i+1}\u22121) with all leaves L having their \u0393(k\u2212i\u22121)-neighbourhood equal to R and no other edges into \u0393(k\u2212i\u22121). Then deg^+_{\u0393(k\u2212i\u22121)}(w)=|R|=\u2113^{i+1}\u22121 for all w\u2208L, so any attempt to attach \u2113 children to each of the \u2113^i leaves must fail by pigeonhole. Hence thresholds strictly below |V(B_i)|+\u2113^{i+1} can fail, showing the \u2113^{i+1} term is necessary (up to O(1)) at level i for the greedy method.\n- Greedy ray packing is tight in this framework: If for each w the rays of S(w) are arranged so that every previously occupied non-center in G hits a distinct ray of S(w), then a forbidden set F of size (|V(B)|\u22121)+(m\u00b7k\u2113) indeed blocks that many rays at the m-th step, showing Proposition 3\u2019s bound cannot be reduced below additive O(1) by one-by-one greedy selection.\n\nSmall technical lemma (used implicitly in k=2 proof)\n\nLemma 5 (out-degree regularization by deletion). If \u03b4^+(G)=d, there exists a spanning subgraph G\u2032 with deg^+_{G\u2032}(v)=d for all v.\n\nProof. For each vertex v with deg^+(v)>d, delete arbitrary out-edges of v until its out-degree is d. Vertices with deg^+(v)=d remain unchanged. This preserves deg^+\u2265d for all, hence deg^+\u2261d in G\u2032.\n\nExamples\n\n- \u2113=2 calibration. From Lemma 1, S_{k,2}=4\u00b72^k\u2212k\u22125, roughly half of 2k\u00b72^k for large k. With Proposition 3, h\u22652\u00b72^{k+1}\u22122k+2^{k+1}\u22121+2=3\u00b72^{k+1}\u22122k+1, refining the earlier 3k\u00b72^{k+1}.\n\nObstacles\n\n- Removing the residual O(k) in S_{k,\u2113} and driving the leading constant toward (1+o(1)) seems to require a global b-matching/nibble across all leaves per level, beyond local degree constraints; the lexicographic-partition proof inherently sums thresholds over levels.\n- For k=2, the 2-walk/matching method appears tight after the necessary \u201c\u2212deg^+_B(a)\u201d correction; further constant improvements will likely require a different decomposition or exploiting extra structure (e.g., expansion in B or co-degree bounds).\n\nNext steps\n\n- Per-depth global b-matching: formulate Hall-type sufficient conditions for an \u2113-demand on each leaf into \u0393-sets, perhaps via Haxell\u2019s theorem on hypergraph matchings, to reduce the |V(B_i)| overhead toward (1+o(1))\u2113^{i+1} and aim at S_{k,\u2113}=(1+o(1))\u00b7C(\u2113)\u00b7\u2113^k.\n- Globalized ray packing: treat all S(w) simultaneously and apply a nibble (Pippenger\u2013Spencer) or flow to allocate \u2113 rays per center, targeting h=(1+o(1))k\u2113^{k+1}.\n- Bound f(k,h) polynomially in h for fixed k: attempt a layered out-expansion cum matching argument to show d\u2265C_k\u00b7h^\u03b1 (with \u03b1 small, ideally \u03b1=1), making the overall \u03b4^+ thresholds far smaller than those implicit in current literature.\n\nSummary of auditable contributions\n\n- Exact and corrected expressions for S_{k,\u2113} (including S_{k,2}=4\u00b72^k\u2212k\u22125) and a sharp general upper bound S_{k,\u2113} \u2264 (\u2113^2/(\u2113\u22121)^2)\u00b7\u2113^k + O_\u2113(1)+O(k).\n- Robust \u03b4+-commonness lemma with forbidden sets (and its integration), underpinning the precise greedy ray-packing bound h \u2265 (|V(B)|\u22121)+(|L|\u22121)\u00b7k\u2113+\u2113.\n- Parameterized t-analysis in the k=2 spider proof showing t=2\u2113 is optimal within the 2-walk/matching template, thereby explaining current constant barriers.\n- Lower-bound constructions demonstrating near-tightness of the \u2113^{i+1} component in t_{k\u2212i} and of the greedy ray-packing threshold within the present framework."
