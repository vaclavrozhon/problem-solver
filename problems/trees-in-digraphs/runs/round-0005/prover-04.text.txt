Ideas

- Quantify and standardize the variable-threshold sum S_{k,ℓ} with explicit constants; give an exact closed form for ℓ=2 and a sharp general upper bound, fixing a factor-ℓ slip and a small off-by-one.
- Formalize a “robust δ+-commonness with forbidden sets” lemma; it streamlines the use of centers of S^-_{k,h} that avoid previously used vertices, and it validates the refined h bound precisely.
- Parameterize the A/B-threshold in the k=2 spider proof and optimize over t to confirm that the choice t=2ℓ is best within the 2-walk/matching method.
- Give simple lower-bound constructions showing the per-level thresholds ℓ^{i+1} (in t_{k−i}) and the greedy ray-packing bound are essentially tight within the current framework.

Lemmas and proofs

Lemma 1 (exact S_{k,ℓ} and constants). For ℓ≥2, k≥1, with the schedule t_k=ℓ and t_{k−j}=ℓ^{j+1}+⌈(ℓ^{j+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉ for 1≤j≤k−1,
S_{k,ℓ}:=∑_{i=1}^k t_i = ℓ + ∑_{j=1}^{k−1} ℓ^{j+1} + ∑_{j=1}^{k−1} ⌈(ℓ^{j+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉.
In particular,
S_{k,ℓ} ≤ ℓ + (ℓ(ℓ^k−ℓ))/(ℓ−1) + (ℓ(ℓ^k−ℓ))/(ℓ−1)^2 + (k−1)
= (ℓ^2/(ℓ−1)^2)·ℓ^k + O_ℓ(1) + O(k) = Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k).
For ℓ=2 one has t_{k−j}=2^{j+2}−1 (1≤j≤k−1) and t_k=2, hence the exact closed form
S_{k,2} = 2 + ∑_{j=1}^{k−1}(2^{j+2}−1) = 4·2^k − k − 5.

Proof. Direct summation; use ⌈x⌉≤x+1 and the geometric series. The ℓ=2 expression follows from the identity ∑_{j=1}^{k−1}2^{j+2}=2^{k+2}−8.

Lemma 2 (robust δ+-commonness with forbidden sets). Let P be a δ+-common property with threshold d(P). For a fixed F⊆V(G), define P_F(v):=“v satisfies P in G−F.” Then P_F is δ+-common with threshold d(P)+|F| and P_F⇒P.

Proof. If δ^+(G)≥d(P)+|F|, then δ^+(G−F)≥d(P), so G−F contains a vertex v with P. Since P is anti-monotone, v also has P in G. Thus P_F is δ+-common with threshold d(P)+|F| and P_F implies P.

Corollary 2.1 (clean integration into T(k,ℓ)). In Theorem “outstar-with-δ+-common-leaves,” when P is “center of S^-_{k,h}” and F is the current forbidden set (B plus previously chosen rays), Lemma 2 permits invoking δ+-commonness directly in G−F with threshold f(k,h)+|F|, justifying the precise greedy ray-packing bound below.

Proposition 3 (exact greedy ray-packing threshold). Let B≅B^+_{k,ℓ} be embedded with leaf set L (|L|=ℓ^k). Suppose each w∈L is the center of a copy S(w)≅S^-_{k,h}. If
h ≥ (|V(B)|−1) + (|L|−1)·kℓ + ℓ,
then there exist pairwise vertex-disjoint subspiders S′(w)≅S^-_{k,ℓ} such that S′(w)∩B={w}.

Proof. When choosing S′(w), the forbidden set F comprises V(B)\{w} and the non-centers already used in S′(w′), w′≠w. Each non-center lies on exactly one ray of S(w), so F blocks at most |F| rays. With |F| ≤ (|V(B)|−1) + (|L|−1)·kℓ, there remain at least h−|F|≥ℓ rays, so S′(w) exists. Greedy over w∈L.

Remark. With |V(B)|=(ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) and |L|=ℓ^k, this yields
h ≥ kℓ^{k+1} − kℓ + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ,
which strictly improves earlier kℓ^{k+1}+2ℓ^k+ℓ and kℓ^{k+1} + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ.

Proposition 4 (k=2, parameterized A/B threshold; optimal choice). Fix t≥2ℓ and define A={v:deg^−(v)≥t}, B=V\A. Assume all out-degrees equal d. If no r∈A has deg^−_A(r)≥2ℓ, then there exists a∈A such that the maximum matching size s between L:=V\{a} and R:=N^-_B(a) in the predecessor bipartite graph H satisfies
s ≥ (d(d−t) − d)/(d + t − 1).
Consequently, S^-_{2,ℓ} exists provided d solves d(d−t)−d > ℓ(d+t−1).
In the asymptotic regime d=cℓ, t=aℓ (a≥2), this inequality reads c^2 − (a+1)c − a > 0, minimized at a=2, i.e. c ≥ (3+√17)/2. Hence t=2ℓ is optimal within this method.

Proof. Same 2-walk counting template as in the paper, replacing 2ℓ by t. The predecessor-graph correction |E(H)|=|V→B→{a}|−deg^+_B(a)≥d(d−t)−d and |E(H)|≤(d+t−1)s yield the claimed bound on s.

Lower-bound constructions and near-tightness

- Necessity of the ℓ^{i+1} component in t_{k−i}. For fixed i, construct disjoint sets L (|L|=ℓ^i) and R (|R|=ℓ^{i+1}−1) with all leaves L having their Γ(k−i−1)-neighbourhood equal to R and no other edges into Γ(k−i−1). Then deg^+_{Γ(k−i−1)}(w)=|R|=ℓ^{i+1}−1 for all w∈L, so any attempt to attach ℓ children to each of the ℓ^i leaves must fail by pigeonhole. Hence thresholds strictly below |V(B_i)|+ℓ^{i+1} can fail, showing the ℓ^{i+1} term is necessary (up to O(1)) at level i for the greedy method.
- Greedy ray packing is tight in this framework: If for each w the rays of S(w) are arranged so that every previously occupied non-center in G hits a distinct ray of S(w), then a forbidden set F of size (|V(B)|−1)+(m·kℓ) indeed blocks that many rays at the m-th step, showing Proposition 3’s bound cannot be reduced below additive O(1) by one-by-one greedy selection.

Small technical lemma (used implicitly in k=2 proof)

Lemma 5 (out-degree regularization by deletion). If δ^+(G)=d, there exists a spanning subgraph G′ with deg^+_{G′}(v)=d for all v.

Proof. For each vertex v with deg^+(v)>d, delete arbitrary out-edges of v until its out-degree is d. Vertices with deg^+(v)=d remain unchanged. This preserves deg^+≥d for all, hence deg^+≡d in G′.

Examples

- ℓ=2 calibration. From Lemma 1, S_{k,2}=4·2^k−k−5, roughly half of 2k·2^k for large k. With Proposition 3, h≥2·2^{k+1}−2k+2^{k+1}−1+2=3·2^{k+1}−2k+1, refining the earlier 3k·2^{k+1}.

Obstacles

- Removing the residual O(k) in S_{k,ℓ} and driving the leading constant toward (1+o(1)) seems to require a global b-matching/nibble across all leaves per level, beyond local degree constraints; the lexicographic-partition proof inherently sums thresholds over levels.
- For k=2, the 2-walk/matching method appears tight after the necessary “−deg^+_B(a)” correction; further constant improvements will likely require a different decomposition or exploiting extra structure (e.g., expansion in B or co-degree bounds).

Next steps

- Per-depth global b-matching: formulate Hall-type sufficient conditions for an ℓ-demand on each leaf into Γ-sets, perhaps via Haxell’s theorem on hypergraph matchings, to reduce the |V(B_i)| overhead toward (1+o(1))ℓ^{i+1} and aim at S_{k,ℓ}=(1+o(1))·C(ℓ)·ℓ^k.
- Globalized ray packing: treat all S(w) simultaneously and apply a nibble (Pippenger–Spencer) or flow to allocate ℓ rays per center, targeting h=(1+o(1))kℓ^{k+1}.
- Bound f(k,h) polynomially in h for fixed k: attempt a layered out-expansion cum matching argument to show d≥C_k·h^α (with α small, ideally α=1), making the overall δ^+ thresholds far smaller than those implicit in current literature.
