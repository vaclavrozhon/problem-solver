This round refines the paper's constructions and fixes a gap in the k=2 argument. A level-dependent threshold schedule produces S_{k,ℓ}=Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k) (explicit constant bound), removing a multiplicative k factor. The greedy ray-packing bound was sharpened to h ≥ (|V(B)|−1)+(|L|−1)·kℓ+ℓ, which for B^+_{k,ℓ} specializes to h ≈ kℓ^{k+1} plus lower-order terms (substantially better than previous 3kℓ^{k+1}). The k=2 spider proof is repaired using 2-walk counts + maximum matching, yielding s ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1)/(d+2ℓ−1) and threshold d_*(ℓ)=((3ℓ−1)+√(17ℓ^2−10ℓ+1))/2. A robust δ+-commonness (avoidance) lemma was added. Next work focuses on globalizing selections/packings and improving f(k,h).
