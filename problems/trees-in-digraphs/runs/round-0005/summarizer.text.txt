{"summary_md":"This round refines the paper's constructions and fixes a gap in the k=2 argument. A level-dependent threshold schedule produces S_{k,ℓ}=Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k) (explicit constant bound), removing a multiplicative k factor. The greedy ray-packing bound was sharpened to h ≥ (|V(B)|−1)+(|L|−1)·kℓ+ℓ, which for B^+_{k,ℓ} specializes to h ≈ kℓ^{k+1} plus lower-order terms (substantially better than previous 3kℓ^{k+1}). The k=2 spider proof is repaired using 2-walk counts + maximum matching, yielding s ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1)/(d+2ℓ−1) and threshold d_*(ℓ)=((3ℓ−1)+√(17ℓ^2−10ℓ+1))/2. A robust δ+-commonness (avoidance) lemma was added. Next work focuses on globalizing selections/packings and improving f(k,h).","highlights":["Level-dependent thresholds t_{k-i}=ℓ^{i+1}+⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉ give S_{k,ℓ}=Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k) with explicit bounds (no multiplicative k).","Uniform threshold T*=⌈ℓ^k·ℓ/(ℓ−1)⌉ also works but is weaker (cost kT*).","Exact greedy ray-packing threshold: h ≥ (|V(B)|−1)+(|L|−1)·kℓ+ℓ; for B^+_{k,ℓ} this is ≈ kℓ^{k+1}+lower-order terms (improves prior constants).","k=2 proof repaired: using 2-walk counts and a max matching yields s ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1)/(d+2ℓ−1) and d_*(ℓ)=((3ℓ−1)+√(17ℓ^2−10ℓ+1))/2 (fixes a gap).","Added robust δ+-commonness lemma: if δ^+(G)≥d(P)+r then a P-vertex exists outside any forbidden set of size r."],"next_questions":["Implement a global child-selection (b-matching / nibble) across depths to reduce |V(B_i)| overhead and push S_{k,ℓ}→(1+o(1))·C(ℓ)·ℓ^k.","Globalize ray-packing (flow or hypergraph-matching) to reduce h toward (1+o(1))·kℓ^{k+1}.","Obtain substantially better bounds on f(k,h) (ideally polynomial in h for fixed k) to turn structural gains into much smaller δ^+ thresholds." ,"citations"]}
