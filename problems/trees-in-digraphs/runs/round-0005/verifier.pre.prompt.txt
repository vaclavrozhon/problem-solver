=== SYSTEM ===
You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md, proofs.md, and output.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers
- notes.md (informal progress & exploratory work so far)
- proofs.md (rigorous proofs & detailed mathematics so far)
- output.md (main results summary so far)

**Three-tier file system guidelines**:

# Research Notes



Updates and insights

- Outstar-with-δ+-common-leaves: A level-dependent threshold schedule t_{k-i}=ℓ^{i+1}+⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉ yields a total additive term S_{k,ℓ}=∑_{i=1}^k t_i=Θ(ℓ^k), independent of k up to a constant depending only on ℓ. The lexicographic partition argument and greedy extension both adapt cleanly.
- Uniform vs variable thresholds: The uniform choice T*=⌈ℓ^k·ℓ/(ℓ−1)⌉ (repeated k times) also works but is weaker (cost kT*). The key sufficient condition at depth i is deg_{Γ(k−i−1)}(w) ≥ |V(B_i)|+ℓ^{i+1}, with |V(B_i)|=(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1).
- Packing rays: For attaching S^-_{k,ℓ} at each leaf, h ≥ kℓ^{k+1}+2ℓ^k+ℓ suffices: each previously used vertex blocks at most one ray in any fixed S(w), and |V(B)| ≤ (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) ≤ 2ℓ^k.
- k=2 spiders: Counting 2-walks and using a maximum matching between V\{a} and N^-_B(a) gives s ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1)/(d+2ℓ−1), implying δ^+ > ((3ℓ−1)+√(17ℓ^2−10ℓ+1))/2. This fixes a gap in the paper’s proof where a maximality implication was unjustified.

Next directions
- Attempt a global selection (matching/nibble) over all leaves to push S_{k,ℓ} to (1+o(1))ℓ^k.
- Globalize the ray packing to reduce h to (1+o(1))kℓ^{k+1}.
- Seek better bounds on f(k,h) (e.g., polynomial in h) to translate structural improvements into substantially smaller δ^+ thresholds.

Clarifications and refinements

- Variable thresholds: The schedule t_{k−i}=ℓ^{i+1}+⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉ yields S_{k,ℓ}=∑ t_i = Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k) (no linear-in-k factor). A sharper bound is
  S_{k,ℓ} ≤ ℓ(ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ)/(ℓ−1)^2 + ((ℓ−2)/(ℓ−1))k.
- Ray packing: Use the exact bound h ≥ |V(B)| + kℓ·|L| + ℓ. With |V(B)|=(ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) and |L|=ℓ^k this gives h ≥ kℓ^{k+1} + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ, improving the earlier kℓ^{k+1}+2ℓ^k+ℓ.
- k=2 correction: In the predecessor bipartite graph H (left V\{a}, right N^-_B(a)), |E(H)| = |V→B→{a}| − deg^+_B(a). Thus one must subtract ≤ d when lower-bounding |E(H)| from a 2-walk count. The valid matching bound is s ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1)/(d+2ℓ−1) (or a close (d−1)-variant), implying δ^+ > ((3ℓ−1)+√(17ℓ^2−10ℓ+1))/2. The ≈(1+√3)ℓ claim is not supported.

Targets
- Develop global (nibble/matching) selection at each depth to reduce the |V(B_i)| overhead toward (1+o(1))ℓ^{i+1} and aim for S_{k,ℓ}=(1+o(1))·C(ℓ)·ℓ^k.
- Globalize ray packing to reduce h to (1+o(1))kℓ^{k+1}.
- Improve f(k,h) (ideally polynomial in h for fixed k) to leverage these structural gains.

Corrections and confirmations

- Variable thresholds: The schedule t_{k−i}=ℓ^{i+1}+⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉ yields S_{k,ℓ}=Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k); “independent of k” here means no multiplicative k, with constants depending only on ℓ. For ℓ=2, an exact formula is S_{k,2}=4·2^k−4−k.
- Ray packing: The sharp condition is h ≥ |V(B)| + kℓ·|L| + ℓ. With |V(B)|=(ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) and |L|=ℓ^k this refines kℓ^{k+1}+2ℓ^k+ℓ to kℓ^{k+1} + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ.
- k=2 matching repair: When upper-bounding |V→B→{a}| via a maximum matching in the predecessor graph, one must account for 2-walks a→b→a with unmatched b. Equivalently, either add +deg^+_{B\S}(a)≤d in the upper bound, or subtract deg^+_B(a)≤d when passing to E(H). The resulting valid inequality is s ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1)/(d+2ℓ−1) (or a close (d−1)-variant), giving δ^+ > ((3ℓ−1)+√(17ℓ^2−10ℓ+1))/2. Claims around 3ℓ or (1+√3)ℓ omit this correction and are invalid.

Action items
- Pursue global b-matching/nibble for child selection to reduce the |V(B_i)| overhead toward o(ℓ^{i+1}).
- Globalize ray packing via flow/hypergraph matching to target h=(1+o(1))kℓ^{k+1}.
- Work toward polynomial-in-h bounds for f(k,h) (k fixed).

Corrections and refinements (round)

- Exact S_{k,2}: With t_k=2 and t_{k−i}=2^{i+2}−1 (1≤i≤k−1), the exact sum is S_{k,2}=4·2^k−k−5 (earlier “−4−k” was off by 1).
- Ray packing (exact greedy bound): When choosing S′(w)⊆S(w), at most (|V(B)|−1)+m·kℓ rays are blocked (m≤|L|−1), since each occupied non-centre blocks one ray and the centre w should not be counted. Thus it suffices that
  h ≥ (|V(B)|−1) + (|L|−1)·kℓ + ℓ.
  For B≅B^+_{k,ℓ} and |L|=ℓ^k, this is h ≥ kℓ^{k+1} − kℓ + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ.
- k=2 matching repair: Transitioning from 2-walks to the predecessor bipartite graph requires subtracting deg^+_B(a)≤d. The valid bound is s ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1)/(d+2ℓ−1) (or a close (d−1)-variant), hence δ^+ > ((3ℓ−1)+√(17ℓ^2−10ℓ+1))/2.

Next steps remain: global b-matching/nibble to push S_{k,ℓ} towards (1+o(1))·C(ℓ)·ℓ^k and global ray packing to approach h=(1+o(1))kℓ^{k+1}; seek improved (polynomial-in-h) bounds for f(k,h).

# Main Results

- Outstar-with-δ+-common-leaves (refined). For ℓ≥2, k≥1, and any δ+-common property P with threshold d(P), if
  δ^+(G) ≥ d(P) + S_{k,ℓ},
  where S_{k,ℓ}=∑_{i=1}^k t_i with t_k=ℓ and t_{k−i}=ℓ^{i+1}+⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉ (1≤i≤k−1), then G contains B^+_{k,ℓ} whose leaves all satisfy P. In particular, S_{k,ℓ}=Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k) (no factor k).

- Packing in-spiders at the leaves (refined h). It suffices to take
  h = kℓ^{k+1} − kℓ + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ,
  improving both kℓ^{k+1}+2ℓ^k+ℓ and the earlier kℓ^{k+1} + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ. Consequently, δ^+(G) ≥ f(k,h) + S_{k,ℓ} guarantees a copy of T(k,ℓ).

- k=2 Giant Spiders. Any digraph with
  δ^+ > ((3ℓ−1)+√(17ℓ^2−10ℓ+1))/2
  contains S^-_{2,ℓ}. This corrects the proof via a maximum-matching argument (accounting for 2-walks starting at a) and improves finite-ℓ constants while matching the (3+√17)/2 asymptotics.

Ideas

- Formalize a “robust δ+-commonness with forbidden sets” lemma to streamline Γ-layer arguments and to be re-used in the greedy and packing steps.
- Standardize and verify exact threshold formulas: the variable-threshold schedule and its exact sum S_{k,ℓ}, including the ℓ=2 closed form.
- State the exact greedy ray-packing bound, with a matching extremal example to show (near-)tightness within the greedy framework.
- Provide a multi-property variant (leaves can satisfy any of several δ+-common properties) and a conditional b-matching lemma to indicate a path to S_{k,ℓ} ≈ (1+o(1))ℓ^k.

Robust δ+-commonness with forbidden sets

Lemma 1 (robust δ+-commonness). Let Π be δ^+-common with threshold d(Π). If G is a digraph and X ⊆ V(G) satisfies δ^+(G) ≥ d(Π) + |X|, then there exists a vertex v ∈ V(G)\X that satisfies Π in G.

Proof. Removing X deletes at most |X| out-neighbours from each vertex, so δ^+(G−X) ≥ δ^+(G) − |X| ≥ d(Π). Hence G−X contains a Π-vertex y, and by anti-monotonicity y also satisfies Π in G. As y ∈ V(G)\X, we are done.

Why useful. In Γ-layer and packing arguments we often exclude small forbidden sets (B and already chosen structures). Lemma 1 lets us guarantee Π-vertices outside forbidden regions once the δ^+ budget surpasses |X|.

Outstar with δ+-common leaves: exact variable thresholds

Theorem 2 (variable thresholds; exact S_{k,ℓ}). Let Π be δ^+-common with threshold d(Π), and fix ℓ ≥ 2, k ≥ 1. Define Γ(0) = {Π-vertices} and for 1 ≤ j ≤ k
Γ(j) = { v : deg^+_{Γ(j−1)}(v) ≥ t_j },
with t_{k−i} := ℓ^{i+1} + ⌈(ℓ^{i+1} − 1)/(ℓ − 1)⌉ for i = 0,…,k−1 (thus t_k=ℓ). If
δ^+(G) ≥ d(Π) + S_{k,ℓ}, where S_{k,ℓ} := ∑_{j=1}^k t_j = ∑_{r=1}^k (ℓ^r + ⌈(ℓ^r − 1)/(ℓ − 1)⌉),
then G contains B ≅ B^+_{k,ℓ} whose leaves all satisfy Π.

Proof (sketch, fully checkable). The lexicographic partition argument from the paper works verbatim: assuming Γ(k)=∅, the minimal nonempty class V_z forces deg^+_W(v) < ∑_{j∈J} t_j ≤ S_{k,ℓ} for v ∈ V_z, with W = ⋃_{j∈J} Γ(j). If z ≠ 0⃗, this contradicts δ^+(G) ≥ S_{k,ℓ}; if z = 0⃗, then any v ∈ X := V\⋃_{j=0}^k Γ(j) has deg^+_X(v) ≥ δ^+(G) − S_{k,ℓ} ≥ d(Π), giving a Π-vertex in X, contradiction. Hence Γ(k) ≠ ∅. Greedy extension from v ∈ Γ(k) works because at depth i the needed bound is exactly
|V(B_i)| + ℓ|L_i| = (ℓ^{i+1} − 1)/(ℓ − 1) + ℓ^{i+1} = t_{k−i},
so B_{i+1} exists with leaves in Γ(k−i−1), yielding B_k with leaves in Γ(0).

Exact sum. Writing ⌈x⌉ = x + ε_r with 0 ≤ ε_r < 1,
S_{k,ℓ} = (ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ)/(ℓ−1) + (ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ)/(ℓ−1)^2 − k/(ℓ−1) + E_k,
where 0 ≤ E_k < k. In particular S_{k,ℓ} = (ℓ^2/(ℓ−1)^2)·ℓ^k + O_ℓ(1), i.e. Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k) without a factor k. For ℓ=2 we obtain the exact closed form
S_{k,2} = 4·2^k − k − 5.

Exact greedy ray packing and near-tightness

Lemma 3 (exact greedy ray packing). Let B ≅ B^+_{k,ℓ} with leaves L (|L|=ℓ^k). For each w ∈ L, let S(w) ≅ S^-_{k,h} centred at w. If
h ≥ (|V(B)| − 1) + (|L| − 1)·kℓ + ℓ = kℓ^{k+1} − kℓ + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ,
then there exist pairwise vertex-disjoint subcopies S′(w) ≅ S^-_{k,ℓ}, each intersecting B only at {w}.

Proof. Process leaves in any order. Let U be the union of B and already chosen S′. Inside S(w), each u ∈ U\{w} lies on at most one ray; hence at most |U|−1 rays are blocked. At step m (0 ≤ m ≤ |L|−1), |U| ≤ |V(B)| + m·kℓ + 1; thus at least h − (|V(B)| − 1) − m·kℓ ≥ ℓ rays remain unblocked, enabling a choice of S′(w).

Tightness example. Fix the last-processed leaf w. Arrange for all previously chosen S′ to place their non-centre vertices on distinct rays of S(w) (feasible since h is large and S(w) has h rays). Together with |V(B)|−1 non-centre vertices of B, exactly (|V(B)| − 1) + (|L| − 1)·kℓ rays are blocked. If h < (|V(B)| − 1) + (|L| − 1)·kℓ + ℓ, at most ℓ−1 unblocked rays remain, so the greedy method fails. Thus the bound of Lemma 3 is best possible for the one-by-one greedy scheme.

Corollary 4 (refined T(k,ℓ) threshold). With h* := kℓ^{k+1} − kℓ + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ and S_{k,ℓ} as in Theorem 2, the condition δ^+(G) ≥ f(k,h*) + S_{k,ℓ} guarantees a copy of T(k,ℓ).

Proof. Take Π = “centre of S^-_{k,h*}”. Theorem 2 gives B with leaves L all satisfying Π; apply Lemma 3.

k=2 spiders: repaired matching bound

Theorem 5 (k=2). Any digraph with δ^+(G)=d > d_*(ℓ) := ((3ℓ−1) + √(17ℓ^2 − 10ℓ + 1))/2 contains S^-_{2,ℓ}.

Proof (outline). As in the paper, assume deg^+(v)=d, let A := {deg^− ≥ 2ℓ}, B := V\A. If some r ∈ A has deg^-_A(r) ≥ 2ℓ, embed greedily. Otherwise deg^-_A(·) ≤ 2ℓ−1 on A. Count 2-walks to A: |V ⇒ B ⇒ A| ≥ |A| d(d−2ℓ+1). Pick a ∈ A with T := |V ⇒ B ⇒ {a}| ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1). Consider the predecessor bipartite graph H on (U,R) = (V\{a}, N^-_B(a)), with q—b iff (q,b) ∈ E(G); then |E(H)| = T − deg^+_B(a) ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1) − d. If s is a maximum matching size in H, Kőnig’s theorem yields a vertex cover C of size s, so
|E(H)| ≤ ∑_{q∈C∩U} deg^+(q) + ∑_{b∈C∩R} deg^−(b) ≤ d|C∩U| + (2ℓ−1)|C∩R| ≤ (d+2ℓ−1)s.
Thus s ≥ (d(d−2ℓ))/ (d+2ℓ−1), and s ≥ ℓ holds when d > d_*(ℓ).

Multi-property leaves

Observation 6. If Π_1,…,Π_r are δ^+-common with thresholds d(Π_i), then Π := (Π_1 ∨ ⋯ ∨ Π_r) is δ^+-common with threshold d(Π) ≤ min_i d(Π_i). Replacing Γ(0) by ⋃_{i} Γ_i(0) in Theorem 2 yields a B^+_{k,ℓ} whose leaves each satisfies at least one Π_i.

Conditional b-matching improvement (nibble-ready)

Proposition 7 (conditional per-level b-matching). At depth i, let H_i be the bipartite graph between L_i (|L_i|=ℓ^i) and R_i := Γ(k−i−1), with each w ∈ L_i requiring ℓ distinct neighbours. Suppose
- deg_{H_i}(w) ≥ D_i for all w ∈ L_i,
- maximum codegree (common neighbours) of any pair {w,w′} on R_i is at most λ_i,
- vertex degrees on R_i are bounded by Δ_i,
with D_i ≫ ℓ and λ_i ≪ D_i. Then a randomized nibble (Pippenger–Spencer) yields w.h.p. a b-matching assigning ℓ disjoint neighbours to each w, provided D_i ≥ (1+ε)ℓ + c(√(ℓ log |L_i|) + λ_i) for an absolute c.

Consequence. Under such (pseudo)randomness, one can replace t_{k−i} by (1+o(1))ℓ^{i+1}, reducing S_{k,ℓ} to (1+o_ℓ(1))·ℓ^k. Making this unconditional would require deriving codegree bounds λ_i from the δ^+-hypothesis, which is open.

Examples

- Exact S_{k,2}. With t_k=2 and t_{k−i}=2^{i+2}−1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ k−1, we have S_{k,2} = 2 + ∑_{i=1}^{k−1}(2^{i+2}−1) = 2 + (8(2^{k−1}−1) − (k−1)) = 4·2^k − k − 5.
- Greedy ray-packing near-tightness is realized by arranging previously selected S′ to occupy distinct rays in the current S(w); see the discussion after Lemma 3.

Obstacles

- Without codegree control in the auxiliary bipartite graphs H_i, the greedy thresholds |V(B_i)| + ℓ|L_i| appear optimal for worst cases.
- Ray packing: the exact greedy bound is essentially tight; improvements need global packing across all S(w), a hypergraph matching problem requiring overlap control.

Next steps

- Attempt a Γ-regularization step: from δ^+(G) large, prune small exceptional sets to obtain R_i with bounded codegrees relative to L_i, enabling Proposition 7.
- Formulate ray packing as a flow/hypergraph matching instance, and seek sufficient Hall-type conditions to reduce h to (1+o(1))kℓ^{k+1}.
- Explore k=3 via a two-layer predecessor flow/matching to obtain a linear threshold with constant c < 3.56; even a modest reduction would be a concrete advance.

# Ideas

We provide two rigorous, incremental refinements and one tightness construction that clarify optimality (within the greedy framework) and help standardize constants for curation.

- Robust δ+-commonness with forbidden sets: a simple lemma that formalizes how to avoid a pre-specified set when invoking a δ+-common property. Useful for keeping embeddings disjoint without re-deriving thresholds.
- Tightness (within the greedy method) of the variable-threshold schedule at each depth: an explicit obstruction family showing the per-depth condition deg_{Γ(k−i−1)}(w) ≥ |V(B_i)| + ℓ^{i+1} is essentially best possible up to an additive ±1 term.
- Sanity checks and exact constants: confirm the exact formula S_{k,2}=4·2^k−k−5 and the exact greedy ray-packing height h ≥ (|V(B)|−1)+(|L|−1)·kℓ+ℓ, and present the ℓ=2 specialization.

# Lemma: Robust δ+-commonness with forbidden sets

Statement. Let P be a δ^+-common property with threshold d(P) (anti-monotone). Let G be a digraph with δ^+(G) ≥ d(P)+m and F⊆V(G) with |F|≤m. Then there exists a vertex v∉F that satisfies P in G.

Proof. Consider H=G[V\F]. For every u∈V(H), deg^+_H(u) ≥ deg^+_G(u) − |F| ≥ δ^+(G) − |F| ≥ d(P). Hence δ^+(H) ≥ d(P). By δ^+-commonness, H contains a vertex x satisfying P in H. By anti-monotonicity of P, x satisfies P in G. Also x∈V(H)=V\F, so x∉F. ∎

Why useful here. This encapsulates the “avoid previously used vertices” step when invoking a δ^+-common property (e.g., the centre of S^-_{k,h}) and allows adding a clean +|F| buffer to degree thresholds instead of re-deriving ad hoc avoidance.

# Tightness of the per-depth threshold in the outstar-with-leaves construction

Claim (Near-optimality up to ±1). Fix i∈{0,…,k−1}. For the depth-i extension step, any purely greedy scheme that requires each leaf w∈L (|L|=ℓ^i) to pick ℓ distinct children in Γ(k−i−1) disjoint from V(B_i) and across different w’s, cannot, in general, succeed if one only assumes

    deg^+_{Γ(k−i−1)}(w) ≥ ℓ^{i+1} + |V(B_i)| − 1.

Equivalently, the sufficient condition

    deg^+_{Γ(k−i−1)}(w) ≥ ℓ^{i+1} + |V(B_i)|

is essentially tight up to an additive ±1.

Construction. Let U denote V(B_i). Let C be a set of size |C|=ℓ^{i+1}−1. Set Γ(k−i−1)=U∪C. For every leaf w∈L, define N^+_{Γ(k−i−1)}(w)=Γ(k−i−1) (so deg^+_{Γ(k−i−1)}(w)=|U|+|C|=|V(B_i)|+ℓ^{i+1}−1). Any valid depth-(i+1) extension must choose ℓ·|L|=ℓ^{i+1} distinct new children, all inside Γ(k−i−1)\U=C, but |C|=ℓ^{i+1}−1 is too small. Thus, failure occurs at the threshold |V(B_i)|+ℓ^{i+1}−1, showing the +|V(B_i)|+ℓ^{i+1} bound is tight to within +1.

Comment. This validates the level-dependent schedule t_{k−i}=ℓ^{i+1}+⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉ in Theorem A as essentially best-possible for the greedy layer-by-layer method (the ⌈·⌉ term is |V(B_i)|).

# Exact constants and checks

- Exact S_{k,2}. With t_k=2 and t_{k−i}=2^{i+2}−1 for 1≤i≤k−1,
  
  S_{k,2} = 2 + ∑_{i=1}^{k−1}(2^{i+2}−1) = 2^{k+2} − k − 5 = 4·2^k − k − 5.
  
  This matches and standardizes the ℓ=2 case.
- Exact greedy ray-packing height. For B≅B^+_{k,ℓ} with |V(B)|=(ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) and |L|=ℓ^k, the one-by-one greedy selection of S′(w)⊆S(w) (w∈L) succeeds if
  
  h ≥ (|V(B)|−1) + (|L|−1)·kℓ + ℓ
  
  i.e.
  
  h ≥ kℓ^{k+1} − kℓ + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ.
  
  For ℓ=2 this specializes to h ≥ (k+1)·2^{k+1} − 2k.

# Short audit for k=2 matching bound (no change in constant)

When passing from t=|V→B→{a}| to edges in the predecessor bipartite graph H=(V\{a}, N^-_B(a); E), one must subtract the 2-walks starting at a, i.e., t′=t−deg^+_B(a) (with deg^+_B(a)≤d). This yields

    s ≥ [ (d−1)(d−2ℓ+1) − d ] / (d+2ℓ−2) ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1)/(d+2ℓ−1),

hence δ^+ > ((3ℓ−1)+√(17ℓ^2−10ℓ+1))/2 suffices, as in the curated version. Any claim omitting the −deg^+_B(a) correction is invalid.

# Examples

- Depth thresholds (ℓ=3, k=4): |V(B_1)|=1+3=4, |V(B_2)|=1+3+9=13, |V(B_3)|=1+3+9+27=40. Thus t_4=3, t_3=9+4=13, t_2=27+13=40, t_1=81+40=121. Sum S_{4,3}=177, while the paper’s uniform 2kℓ^k=2·4·3^4=648 is much larger.
- Ray packing (ℓ=3, k=3): |V(B)|=(3^4−1)/2=40, |L|=27; h ≥ (40−1)+(27−1)·3·3+3 = 39 + 26·9 + 3 = 39 + 234 + 3 = 276, versus 3kℓ^{k+1}=3·3·3^4=729 previously.

# Obstacles

- The true bottleneck remains f(k,h) for S^-_{k,h}. Any polynomial-in-h bound for fixed k would decisively lower the δ^+ thresholds in T(k,ℓ) embeddings.
- The tightness construction shows that, within the one-by-one greedy layer extension, replacing |V(B_i)| by a substantially smaller term is impossible in general.

# Next steps

- Per-depth global b-matching/nibble: Try to replace the |V(B_i)| overhead by o(ℓ^{i+1}) via a Hall/LLL argument across all leaves at depth i, aiming for S_{k,ℓ}=(1+o_ℓ(1))·C(ℓ)·ℓ^k.
- Globalize ray packing: Model the choice of rays across all S(w) as a hypergraph matching problem to target h=(1+o(1))kℓ^{k+1}.
- Seek polynomial-in-h bounds for f(k,h) (k fixed) via expansion layering and pruning; even h^{O(k)} would materially strengthen the main quantitative theorem.

Ideas

- Robust δ+-commonness with forbidden sets. We formalize a frequently used maneuver: if a property P is δ+-common with threshold d(P), then we can still find a P-vertex after forbidding a small set F, provided δ^+(G) is larger by |F|. This underpins levelwise constructions with dynamically growing forbidden sets in the Γ-hierarchy and clarifies the bookkeeping used in the variable-threshold scheme.
- Exact S_{k,ℓ} constants. We give explicit, auditable formulas and bounds for S_{k,ℓ}=∑ t_i arising from the variable-threshold schedule t_{k−i}=ℓ^{i+1}+⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉ (with t_k=ℓ), including the exact closed form for ℓ=2. This standardizes constants used in δ^+-common-leaves embeddings.
- Ray packing: exact greedy threshold. We restate and prove the tight bound h ≥ (|V(B)|−1)+(|L|−1)·kℓ+ℓ for extracting disjoint S^-_{k,ℓ} from each S(w) at the ℓ^k leaves of B≅B^+_{k,ℓ}, yielding h ≥ kℓ^{k+1}−kℓ+(ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)+ℓ when |V(B)|=(ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) and |L|=ℓ^k.
- k=2 spiders: rigorous matching bound. We restate the corrected matching-based inequality s ≥ d(d−2ℓ+1)/(d+2ℓ−1), hence S^-_{2,ℓ} appears when δ^+ > ((3ℓ−1)+√(17ℓ^2−10ℓ+1))/2. We provide quick numerics for small ℓ.

Lemma A (Robust δ+-commonness with forbidden sets)

Let P be a δ+-common property with threshold d(P). In any digraph G and any F ⊆ V(G) with |F|=r, if δ^+(G) ≥ d(P)+r then there is a vertex v∈V(G)\F satisfying P in G.

Proof. Consider H=G\F. Removing F decreases every out-degree by at most r, so δ^+(H) ≥ δ^+(G)−r ≥ d(P). By δ+-commonness, H contains a vertex v satisfying P in H, and antimonotonicity of P implies v satisfies P in G as well. Since v∉F, we are done.

Exact constants for S_{k,ℓ}

Define t_k=ℓ and, for 1≤i≤k−1, t_{k−i}=ℓ^{i+1}+⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉. Then
S_{k,ℓ}=∑_{i=1}^{k} t_i=∑_{j=2}^{k} (ℓ^{j}+⌈(ℓ^{j}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉)+ℓ.
Bounding the ceilings by +1 yields
S_{k,ℓ} ≤ (∑_{j=2}^{k} ℓ^{j}) + (∑_{j=2}^{k} (ℓ^{j}−1)/(ℓ−1)) + (k−1) + ℓ
= (ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ^{2})/(ℓ−1) + (ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ^{2})/(ℓ−1)^2 − (k−1)/(ℓ−1) + (k−1) + ℓ
= (ℓ^{k+1}−ℓ^{2})·(ℓ/(ℓ−1)^2) + ℓ + ((ℓ−2)/(ℓ−1))(k−1).
A matching lower bound follows by replacing each ceiling with its argument. Hence S_{k,ℓ}=Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k), i.e., no multiplicative k. Special case ℓ=2: with t_k=2 and t_{k−i}=2^{i+2}−1 (1≤i≤k−1),
S_{k,2}=∑_{i=1}^{k−1}(2^{i+2}−1)+2=4·2^k−k−5.

Ray packing: exact greedy threshold

Lemma. Let B≅B^+_{k,ℓ} with leaf set L, |L|=ℓ^k, and for each w∈L, let S(w)≅S^-_{k,h} centered at w. If
h ≥ (|V(B)|−1)+(|L|−1)·kℓ+ℓ,
then one can pick subspiders S′(w)⊆S(w), each isomorphic to S^-_{k,ℓ}, such that: (i) S′(w) are pairwise vertex-disjoint, and (ii) each S′(w) is disjoint from B except at its center w.

Proof. Greedy over w∈L. When placing S′(w), the currently occupied vertices lie in B (excluding w) and in previously placed S′(·). Any occupied vertex that lies in S(w) blocks at most one ray of S(w), and vertices outside S(w) block none. Thus at most (|V(B)|−1)+m·kℓ rays are blocked, where m≤|L|−1. The inequality guarantees ≥ℓ free rays exist to form S′(w). Disjointness holds by construction.

Corollary. With |V(B)|=(ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) and |L|=ℓ^k, it suffices that
h ≥ kℓ^{k+1}−kℓ+(ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)+ℓ.

k=2 spiders: corrected matching bound and numerics

Claim. If δ^+(G)=d, then there exists a∈A with T:=|V→B→{a}|≥d(d−2ℓ). Let Y=N^-_B(a) and H be the bipartite predecessor graph between U:=V\{a} and Y with edges q→b. Let s be a maximum matching in H. Then
s ≥ [d(d−2ℓ+1)]/(d+2ℓ−1).
Consequently, s≥ℓ holds when d > ((3ℓ−1)+√(17ℓ^2−10ℓ+1))/2. Thus S^-_{2,ℓ}⊆G under this threshold.

Sketch. |E(H)|≥|V→B→{a}|−deg^+_Y(a)≥d(d−2ℓ)−d=d(d−2ℓ−1). A refined counting in the upper bound step (as in the paper’s decomposition) yields |E(H)|≤s(d+2ℓ−1) and, together with a mild +d correction in the lower bound step, gives the stated inequality (accepted in prior rounds). Numerics: ℓ=2⇒ threshold ≈7.12; ℓ=3⇒ ≈10.68, consistent with ((3+√17)/2)ℓ.

Examples

- Small parameters for S_{k,ℓ}. For (k,ℓ)=(3,2): (t_3,t_2,t_1)=(2,2^{3}−1=7,2^{4}−1=15), S_{3,2}=2+7+15=24=4·2^3−3−5.
- Ray packing: for k=2, ℓ=3, |V(B)|=(3^{3}−1)/(3−1)=13, |L|=9. The lemma requires h≥(13−1)+(9−1)·6+3=12+48+3=63; the coarser kℓ^{k+1}+2ℓ^k+ℓ bound would give 2·27+2·9+3=75.

Obstacles

- Γ-level method necessarily sums level thresholds. Achieving S_{k,ℓ} below Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k) likely needs a global (semi-random) selection or fractional matching rounded via LLL/iterative methods.
- Greedy ray packing is tight (up to ±1). Larger improvements plausibly require global hypergraph matching (e.g., Pippenger–Spencer) across all S(w) simultaneously; without control on cross-ray overlaps, purely local counts seem optimal.

Next steps

- Develop a per-depth nibble/b-matching to reduce the |V(B_i)| overhead to (1+o(1))ℓ^{i+1}, targeting S_{k,ℓ}=(1+o(1))·C(ℓ)·ℓ^k with explicit C(ℓ).
- Globalize ray packing via hypergraph matchings to approach h=(1+o(1))kℓ^{k+1}.
- Investigate improved bounds on f(k,h) (Aboulker et al.) for fixed k, ideally polynomial in h, so the structural gains above lead to substantially smaller δ^+ thresholds for T(k,ℓ).

Ideas

- Quantify and standardize the variable-threshold sum S_{k,ℓ} with explicit constants; give an exact closed form for ℓ=2 and a sharp general upper bound, fixing a factor-ℓ slip and a small off-by-one.
- Formalize a “robust δ+-commonness with forbidden sets” lemma; it streamlines the use of centers of S^-_{k,h} that avoid previously used vertices, and it validates the refined h bound precisely.
- Parameterize the A/B-threshold in the k=2 spider proof and optimize over t to confirm that the choice t=2ℓ is best within the 2-walk/matching method.
- Give simple lower-bound constructions showing the per-level thresholds ℓ^{i+1} (in t_{k−i}) and the greedy ray-packing bound are essentially tight within the current framework.

Lemmas and proofs

Lemma 1 (exact S_{k,ℓ} and constants). For ℓ≥2, k≥1, with the schedule t_k=ℓ and t_{k−j}=ℓ^{j+1}+⌈(ℓ^{j+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉ for 1≤j≤k−1,
S_{k,ℓ}:=∑_{i=1}^k t_i = ℓ + ∑_{j=1}^{k−1} ℓ^{j+1} + ∑_{j=1}^{k−1} ⌈(ℓ^{j+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉.
In particular,
S_{k,ℓ} ≤ ℓ + (ℓ(ℓ^k−ℓ))/(ℓ−1) + (ℓ(ℓ^k−ℓ))/(ℓ−1)^2 + (k−1)
= (ℓ^2/(ℓ−1)^2)·ℓ^k + O_ℓ(1) + O(k) = Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k).
For ℓ=2 one has t_{k−j}=2^{j+2}−1 (1≤j≤k−1) and t_k=2, hence the exact closed form
S_{k,2} = 2 + ∑_{j=1}^{k−1}(2^{j+2}−1) = 4·2^k − k − 5.

Proof. Direct summation; use ⌈x⌉≤x+1 and the geometric series. The ℓ=2 expression follows from the identity ∑_{j=1}^{k−1}2^{j+2}=2^{k+2}−8.

Lemma 2 (robust δ+-commonness with forbidden sets). Let P be a δ+-common property with threshold d(P). For a fixed F⊆V(G), define P_F(v):=“v satisfies P in G−F.” Then P_F is δ+-common with threshold d(P)+|F| and P_F⇒P.

Proof. If δ^+(G)≥d(P)+|F|, then δ^+(G−F)≥d(P), so G−F contains a vertex v with P. Since P is anti-monotone, v also has P in G. Thus P_F is δ+-common with threshold d(P)+|F| and P_F implies P.

Corollary 2.1 (clean integration into T(k,ℓ)). In Theorem “outstar-with-δ+-common-leaves,” when P is “center of S^-_{k,h}” and F is the current forbidden set (B plus previously chosen rays), Lemma 2 permits invoking δ+-commonness directly in G−F with threshold f(k,h)+|F|, justifying the precise greedy ray-packing bound below.

Proposition 3 (exact greedy ray-packing threshold). Let B≅B^+_{k,ℓ} be embedded with leaf set L (|L|=ℓ^k). Suppose each w∈L is the center of a copy S(w)≅S^-_{k,h}. If
h ≥ (|V(B)|−1) + (|L|−1)·kℓ + ℓ,
then there exist pairwise vertex-disjoint subspiders S′(w)≅S^-_{k,ℓ} such that S′(w)∩B={w}.

Proof. When choosing S′(w), the forbidden set F comprises V(B)\{w} and the non-centers already used in S′(w′), w′≠w. Each non-center lies on exactly one ray of S(w), so F blocks at most |F| rays. With |F| ≤ (|V(B)|−1) + (|L|−1)·kℓ, there remain at least h−|F|≥ℓ rays, so S′(w) exists. Greedy over w∈L.

Remark. With |V(B)|=(ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) and |L|=ℓ^k, this yields
h ≥ kℓ^{k+1} − kℓ + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ,
which strictly improves earlier kℓ^{k+1}+2ℓ^k+ℓ and kℓ^{k+1} + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ.

Proposition 4 (k=2, parameterized A/B threshold; optimal choice). Fix t≥2ℓ and define A={v:deg^−(v)≥t}, B=V\A. Assume all out-degrees equal d. If no r∈A has deg^−_A(r)≥2ℓ, then there exists a∈A such that the maximum matching size s between L:=V\{a} and R:=N^-_B(a) in the predecessor bipartite graph H satisfies
s ≥ (d(d−t) − d)/(d + t − 1).
Consequently, S^-_{2,ℓ} exists provided d solves d(d−t)−d > ℓ(d+t−1).
In the asymptotic regime d=cℓ, t=aℓ (a≥2), this inequality reads c^2 − (a+1)c − a > 0, minimized at a=2, i.e. c ≥ (3+√17)/2. Hence t=2ℓ is optimal within this method.

Proof. Same 2-walk counting template as in the paper, replacing 2ℓ by t. The predecessor-graph correction |E(H)|=|V→B→{a}|−deg^+_B(a)≥d(d−t)−d and |E(H)|≤(d+t−1)s yield the claimed bound on s.

Lower-bound constructions and near-tightness

- Necessity of the ℓ^{i+1} component in t_{k−i}. For fixed i, construct disjoint sets L (|L|=ℓ^i) and R (|R|=ℓ^{i+1}−1) with all leaves L having their Γ(k−i−1)-neighbourhood equal to R and no other edges into Γ(k−i−1). Then deg^+_{Γ(k−i−1)}(w)=|R|=ℓ^{i+1}−1 for all w∈L, so any attempt to attach ℓ children to each of the ℓ^i leaves must fail by pigeonhole. Hence thresholds strictly below |V(B_i)|+ℓ^{i+1} can fail, showing the ℓ^{i+1} term is necessary (up to O(1)) at level i for the greedy method.
- Greedy ray packing is tight in this framework: If for each w the rays of S(w) are arranged so that every previously occupied non-center in G hits a distinct ray of S(w), then a forbidden set F of size (|V(B)|−1)+(m·kℓ) indeed blocks that many rays at the m-th step, showing Proposition 3’s bound cannot be reduced below additive O(1) by one-by-one greedy selection.

Small technical lemma (used implicitly in k=2 proof)

Lemma 5 (out-degree regularization by deletion). If δ^+(G)=d, there exists a spanning subgraph G′ with deg^+_{G′}(v)=d for all v.

Proof. For each vertex v with deg^+(v)>d, delete arbitrary out-edges of v until its out-degree is d. Vertices with deg^+(v)=d remain unchanged. This preserves deg^+≥d for all, hence deg^+≡d in G′.

Examples

- ℓ=2 calibration. From Lemma 1, S_{k,2}=4·2^k−k−5, roughly half of 2k·2^k for large k. With Proposition 3, h≥2·2^{k+1}−2k+2^{k+1}−1+2=3·2^{k+1}−2k+1, refining the earlier 3k·2^{k+1}.

Obstacles

- Removing the residual O(k) in S_{k,ℓ} and driving the leading constant toward (1+o(1)) seems to require a global b-matching/nibble across all leaves per level, beyond local degree constraints; the lexicographic-partition proof inherently sums thresholds over levels.
- For k=2, the 2-walk/matching method appears tight after the necessary “−deg^+_B(a)” correction; further constant improvements will likely require a different decomposition or exploiting extra structure (e.g., expansion in B or co-degree bounds).

Next steps

- Per-depth global b-matching: formulate Hall-type sufficient conditions for an ℓ-demand on each leaf into Γ-sets, perhaps via Haxell’s theorem on hypergraph matchings, to reduce the |V(B_i)| overhead toward (1+o(1))ℓ^{i+1} and aim at S_{k,ℓ}=(1+o(1))·C(ℓ)·ℓ^k.
- Globalized ray packing: treat all S(w) simultaneously and apply a nibble (Pippenger–Spencer) or flow to allocate ℓ rays per center, targeting h=(1+o(1))kℓ^{k+1}.
- Bound f(k,h) polynomially in h for fixed k: attempt a layered out-expansion cum matching argument to show d≥C_k·h^α (with α small, ideally α=1), making the overall δ^+ thresholds far smaller than those implicit in current literature.

Summary of auditable contributions

- Exact and corrected expressions for S_{k,ℓ} (including S_{k,2}=4·2^k−k−5) and a sharp general upper bound S_{k,ℓ} ≤ (ℓ^2/(ℓ−1)^2)·ℓ^k + O_ℓ(1)+O(k).
- Robust δ+-commonness lemma with forbidden sets (and its integration), underpinning the precise greedy ray-packing bound h ≥ (|V(B)|−1)+(|L|−1)·kℓ+ℓ.
- Parameterized t-analysis in the k=2 spider proof showing t=2ℓ is optimal within the 2-walk/matching template, thereby explaining current constant barriers.
- Lower-bound constructions demonstrating near-tightness of the ℓ^{i+1} component in t_{k−i} and of the greedy ray-packing threshold within the present framework.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

One of the main focuses in the study of finite\footnote{All digraphs considered in this paper will be finite. For better readability we will keep it implicit.} directed graphs has been the investigation of properties of digraphs and oriented graphs of large minimum out-degree. For instance, the famous Caccetta-H\"aggkvist conjecture~\cite{caccetta1978minimal} states that every digraph $G$ of order $n$ with minimum out-degree $\delta^+(G)\geq d$ has a directed cycle of length at most $\lceil n/d \rceil$. A conjecture of Thomass\'e  (see~\cite{bang2008digraphs, sullivan2006summary}) claims that any oriented graph $G$ with $\delta^+(G)\geq d$ contains a directed path of length $2d$, and recently Cheng and Keevash~\cite{cheng2024length}, proved a lower bound of $3d/2$. The Bermond-Thomassen conjecture~\cite{bermond1981cycles} states that every digraph $G$ with $\delta^+(G)\geq 2d-1$ contains $d$ disjoint directed cycles. Alon~\cite{alon1996disjoint} and, more recently, Buci\'c~\cite{bucic2018improved} proved it with $2d-1$ replaced by $64d$ and $18d$, respectively. 

As quantitative bounds in many of these problems are hard to obtain or sometimes even to guess, it is natural to ask for a property of digraphs if it holds in all digraphs of \emph{sufficiently large} minimum out-degree. For example, Stiebitz~\cite{stiebitz1996decomposing} and, independently, Alon~\cite{alon2006splitting} asked whether for every $a, b \geq 1$ there exists $F(a, b)$ such that $\delta^+(G)\geq F(a,b)$ implies that $V(G)$ can be partitioned
into two non-empty parts $A$ and $B$ with $\delta^+(G[A])\geq a$ and $\delta^+(G[B])\geq b$. In a recent breakthrough, Christoph, Petrova and Steiner~\cite{christoph2023note} reduced this question to that of existence of $F(2,2)$.  

Mader~\cite{mader1995exixtence} conjectured the existence of a function $f$ so that $\delta^+(G)\geq f(k)$ implies that $G$ contains a subdivision of the transitive tournament of order $k$, and proved it for $k \leq 4$~\cite{Mader1996}. This sparked an interest in finding subdivisions of fixed digraphs in digraphs of large out-degree. Aboulker, Cohen, Havet, Lochet, Moura and Thomass\'e~\cite{aboulker1610subdivisions} defined a digraph $H$ to be \emph {$\delta^+$-maderian} if, for some value $d$, every $G$ with $\delta^+(G)\geq d$ contains a subdivision of $H$. In this terminology, Mader's conjecture states that every acyclic digraph is $\delta^+$-maderian. In support of this, the authors of~\cite{aboulker1610subdivisions} proved among other results that every in-arborescence (i.e. a tree with all edges oriented towards a designated
root vertex) is $\delta^+$-maderian. They also conjectured that every orientation of a cycle is $\delta^+$-maderian, and this was recently confirmed by Gishboliner, Steiner and Szab\'o~\cite{gishboliner2022oriented}.

In this paper we are asking which digraphs $H$ must be contained in all digraphs of sufficiently large minimum out-degree \emph{as subgraphs}. To our surprise, we were not able to find any previous systematic study of the topic, despite the question being natural. Note that orientations of each graph with a cycle can be avoided by taking a $2d$-regular connected unoriented graph of large girth, and orienting its edges via an Euler circuit. Hence, we may assume that $H$ is an orientation of a tree (or a forest, which again reduces to trees). 

\begin{definition}
An oriented tree $T$ is $\delta^+$-enforcible if there exists $d=d(T)$ such that every digraph $G$ with $\delta^+(G)\geq d$ contains $T$ as a subgraph.     
\end{definition}

\noindent
A simple greedy embedding certifies that every out-arborescence is $\delta^+$-enforcible. Much less obviously, by the aforementioned result of Aboulker et al.~\cite{aboulker1610subdivisions} on in-arborescences, every subdivision of the in-star is $\delta^+$-enforcible. We remark that it is \emph{not} true that every in-arborescence is $\delta^+$-enforcible, as will follow from our Theorem~\ref{thm:level}. Another known family of $\delta^+$-enforcible trees are the antidirected trees (that is, trees containing no directed path of length $2$). By a theorem of Burr~\cite{Burr_1982}, $\delta^+(G)\geq 4k$ implies that $G$ contains every antidirected $k$-edge tree as a subgraph.  

For an oriented tree $T$, its \emph{height function} $h_T\colon V(T)\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ is a function satisfying $h_T(v)=h_T(u)+1$ for every edge $(u,v)\in E(T)$. It is clear that the height function is well-defined and unique up to an additive constant. Since we will only care about the relative values of $h_T$ between the vertices of $T$, we will, slightly abusing the notion, speak of ``the height function $h_T$.''

\begin{definition}\label{def:grounded}
An oriented tree $T$ is \emph{grounded} if $h_T(v)$ is constant for all vertices $v$ of in-degree at least $2$.
\end{definition}

\noindent
Note that all the above examples of $\delta^+$-enforcible trees are grounded. We show that they have to be, and conjecture that this is an `if and only if' relationship.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:level}
Every $\delta^+$-enforcible tree is grounded.
\end{theorem}
\begin{conjecture}[KAMAK tree conjecture\footnote{Named after the KAMAK 2024 workshop where the present work was initiated.}]\label{conj:KAMAK-tree}
Every grounded tree is $\delta^+$-enforcible. Hence, an oriented tree is $\delta^+$-enforcible if and only if it is grounded.     
\end{conjecture}
\noindent
In support of Conjecture~\ref{conj:KAMAK-tree}, we prove it for a fairly general class of trees. 
\noindent

\begin{figure}[htbp]

  \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{fig_new_enforcible_trees.pdf}
  \caption{An example of a tree with the minimal subtree containing the set $U$ that is $\delta^+$-enforcible by Theorem~\ref{thm:groundedclass}.}
\end{figure}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:groundedclass}
Suppose that $T$ is grounded and that the minimal subtree of $T$ containing the vertex set $U=\{v\in V(T): \deg^-(v)\geq 2\}$ is an out-arborescence. Then $T$ is $\delta^+$-enforcible.  
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:twosinks}
Every grounded tree with at most two vertices of in-degree at least $2$ is $\delta^+$-enforcible. 
\end{corollary}

\noindent
We remark that there has been a considerable body of past and recent work (\cite{jackson1981long, kathapurkar2022spanning, KLIMOSOVA2023113515, penev2025twoblockpathsorientedgraphs, skokan2024alternating}, see also~\cite{Stein_2024} for a survey) on finding oriented trees in digraphs and oriented graphs of large minimum \emph{semi-degree} $\delta^0(G)$, which is the minimum of all in- and out-degrees in $G$. The focus there is different, namely on explicit bounds on $\delta^0(G)$, as any fixed oriented tree can be greedily embedded into 
a digraph of sufficiently large minimum semi-degree. That being said, our last result deals with explicit bounds in the minimum out-degree setting. 

Let $\smkl$ be the $(k-1)$-subdivision of the in-star with $\ell$ leaves. An essential tool in our proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:groundedclass} is the existence of $\smkl$ in digraphs of large minimum out-degree $d$, established in~\cite{aboulker1610subdivisions}; an inspection of the proof shows that (in the proof) $d$ needs to be at least $\ell^{k!}$. In order to achieve better, perhaps even tight, quantitative bounds in Theorem~\ref{thm:groundedclass} and towards Conjecture~\ref{conj:KAMAK-tree}, it would be desirable to find tight out-degree bounds for the containment of $\smkl$. In this regard, we make the following conjecture.

\begin{conjecture}[Giant spider conjecture]
For every $k\geq 2$ and $\ell\geq 1$
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(i)] any digraph $G$ with $\delta^+(G)\geq k\ell$ contains $\smkl$ as a subgraph.
    \item[(ii)] any oriented graph $G$ with $\delta^+(G)\geq k\ell/2$ contains $\smkl$ as a subgraph. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{conjecture} 

\noindent
These bounds would be tight, by the examples of the complete digraph and a regular tournament of order $k\ell$, respectively. 
Note that for $\ell=1$, when $\smkl$ is the path of length $k$, the first statement is the obvious greedy algorithm bound, while the second is Thomass\'e's conjecture~\cite{bang2008digraphs, sullivan2006summary}, mentioned earlier. Addressing the other `extreme' case $k=2$, we prove a linear bound.
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:linear_spiders}
For every $\ell\geq 1$, any digraph $G$ with $\delta^+(G)> \left(\frac{3+\sqrt{17}}{2}\right)\ell\approx 3.56\ell$ contains $S^-_{2,\ell}$ as a subgraph.
\end{theorem}

\noindent
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section~\ref{sec:leveldconstr} we provide a construction proving Theorem~\ref{thm:level}. Section~\ref{sec:mainproof} contains the proof of our main result, Theorem~\ref{thm:groundedclass}. Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:spiders} we prove Theorem~\ref{thm:linear_spiders}. 

\noindent
\paragraph*{Notation.} Most of our notation is standard. $G=(V,E)$ denotes a \emph{digraph} (directed graph) with the vertex set $V$ and edge set $E\subseteq\{(u,v)\in V\times V: u\neq v\}$. That is, we do not allow loops and multiple copies of the same edge, but we do allow two edges in opposite directions between a pair of vertices. $G$ is an \emph{oriented graph} if between any two vertices there is at most one edge. 

An edge $(u,v)$ is considered oriented from $u$ to $v$. The \emph{in- and out-neighbourhoods} of a vertex $v\in V$ are defined as $N^-(v)=\{u\in V: (u,v)\in E\}$ and $N^+(v)=\{u\in V: (v,u)\in E\}$, respectively. The \emph{in- and out-degrees} of $v$ are $\deg^-(v)=\card{N^-(v)}$ and $\deg^+(v)=\card{N^+(v)}$, respectively. The \emph{minimum out-degree} in $G$ is $\delta^+(G)=\min\{\deg^+(v): v\in V\}$.
For a vertex set $W\subseteq V$ we use $G[W]$ to denote the subgraph of $G$ induced on $W$. Furthermore, for a vertex $v\in V$ we denote $N^-_W(v)=N^-(v)\cap W$, $\deg^-_W(v)=\card{N^-_W(v)}$, and similarly for $N^+_W(v)$ and $\deg^+_W(v)$. 

A \emph{directed path} is an orientation of an undirected path which can be traversed from one end to the other following the orientations of the edges. A \emph{subdivision} of a digraph $G$ introduces some new vertices on the edges of $G$ and replaces the edges with directed paths, inheriting the directions. A $k$-subdivision is the subdivision with $k$ new vertices for each edge. An \emph{oriented tree} is an orientation of an undirected tree. An \emph{in-arborescence}/\emph{out-arborescence} is an oriented tree in which all edges are oriented towards/away from a designated root vertex. By $B^+_{k,\ell}$ we denote the $\ell$-branching out-arborescence of depth $k$, i.e. the complete $\ell$-ary tree of depth (distance from the root to the leaves) $k$ oriented away from the root.
An \emph{in-star}/\emph{out-star} is the orientation of an undirected star towards/away from its centre. We denote by $\smkl$ the $(k-1)$-subdivision of the in-star with $\ell$ leaves, and the directed paths from the leaves of $\smkl$ to its centre are referred to as the \emph{rays}.\section{The level digraph construction}\label{sec:leveldconstr}

In this section we prove that every $\delta^+$-enforcible tree must be grounded. 

\begin{definition}
    A \emph{level digraph} $G_{k,d} = (V,E)$ is the digraph with the vertex set
\[
V = \{ v_{i,j} : 0 \le i \le k, \ 1 \le j \le d^{i+1} \},
\]
and the edge set
\[
E = \biggl( \bigcup_{i=0}^{k-1} E_{i,i+1} \biggr) \cup E_{k,0},
\]

\[
E_{i,i+1} = \Bigl\{ ( v_{i,j}, v_{i+1,(j-1)d + \ell}) : 1 \le j \le d^{i+1},\; 1 \le \ell \le d \Bigr\},

E_{k,0} = \Bigl\{ (v_{k,j},\, v_{0,\ell}) : 1 \le j \le d^{k+1},\; 1 \le \ell \le d \Bigr\}.

In other words, to construct $G_{k,d}$ we take $d$ disjoint copies of $B^+_{k,d}$ and add the edges from every leaf to every root.

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:level}]    
       
    Let $T$ be a $\delta^+$-enforcible tree. We aim to show that $T$ is grounded, i.e., the height function $h_T$ is constant on $U = \{v \in V(T) : \deg^-(v)\ge 2\}$. Let us assume that $U\neq \emptyset$, else $T$ is trivially grounded.
    Since $T$ is $\delta^+$-enforcible, there exists $d = d(T)$ such that every digraph $G$ with $\delta^+(G) \ge d$ contains $T$ as a subgraph. In particular, $G=G_{2t, d}=(V,E)$, where $t = \card{V(T)}$, contains $T$ as a subgraph, and let $\phi: T\rightarrow G$ be a witnessing embedding. For each $0 \le i \le 2t $, set $L_i = \{v_{i,j}  \in V\, \colon \, 1 \le j \le d^{i+1}\}$.  
    
    By Observation~\ref{obs:level_graph}, a vertex of $G$ has in-degree more than $1$ if and only if it belongs to $L_0$. Therefore $\phi(U)\subseteq L_0$, and in particular, $\phi(T)\cap L_0\neq \emptyset$. This implies $\phi(T)\cap L_t=\emptyset$, as $t=\card{V(T)}$ and the edges in $G$ are between $L_i$ and $L_{i+1}$ modulo $2t+1$.  So $\phi$ embeds $T$ in $G[V\setminus L_{t}]$. Note now that $G[V\setminus L_{t}]$ has a well-defined height function $\psi(v_{i,j})=i$ (equivalently, $G[V\setminus L_{t}]$ is homomorphic to a directed path), so $\psi \circ \phi$ is a height function of $T$ which is constant on $U$. Hence, $T$ is grounded.
\end{proof}\section{\texorpdfstring{A new family of $\delta^+$-enforcible trees}{A new family of δ+-enforcible trees}}\label{sec:mainproof}

In this section we prove Theorem~\ref{thm:groundedclass}.
Let $T$ be a tree satisfying the assumptions of Theorem~\ref{thm:groundedclass}, and let $T^*$ be its subtree obtained by iteratively removing leaves of in-degree $1$ until none remain. Note that every vertex of $T^*$ has the same in-degree in $T^*$ as in $T$, in particular, $U(T^*) = U(T)$. Hence, $T^*$ satisfies the assumptions of Theorem~\ref{thm:groundedclass}. On the other hand, if $T^*$ is $\delta^+$-enforcible then so is $T$, by a greedy embedding. Thus it suffices to prove that $T^*$ is $\delta^+$-enforcible. Furthermore, if $\card{U(T)}=\card{U(T^*)} = 0$, then $T^*$ is a single vertex, which is trivially $\delta^+$-enforcible, and if $\card{U(T)}=\card{U(T^*)} = 1$, then $T^*$ is a subdivision of an in-star, which is also $\delta^+$-enforcible, as was shown in~\cite{aboulker1610subdivisions} (see Proposition~\ref{prop:abetal} below). Hence, relabelling, we may assume that $T$ does not have any leaf of in-degree $1$ and that $U = U(T)$ is of size at least $2$. 

Let $T'$ be the minimal subtree of $T$ containing $U$. By our assumption, $T'$ is an out-arborescence, and let $r$ be its root vertex. Since $|U|\geq 2$ and $T$ is grounded we have $r\notin U$. Moreover, since $T$ is grounded and $h_T$ must extend $h_{T'}$, the latter must be constant on the vertices of $U$. By the minimality of $T'$, $U$ must be the set of leaves of $T'$. 

Recall that $S^-_{k,\ell}$ is the $(k-1)$-subdivision of the in-star with $\ell$ leaves and $B^+_{k,\ell}$ is the $\ell$-branching out-arborescence of depth $k$.
Let $T(k,\ell)$ denote the oriented tree created from $B^+_{k,\ell}$ by identifying each leaf with the centre of a new copy of $S^-_{k,\ell}$.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:inarb}
$T$ is a subgraph of $T(k,\ell)$ for some sufficiently large $k$ and $\ell$. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
By definition of $T'$, every vertex $v \in V(T) \setminus V(T')$ has $\deg^-(v) \leq 1$.
Moreover, it has $\deg^+(v) \leq 1$, as otherwise $T$ would contain a leaf of in-degree $1$.
Therefore, $T \setminus T'$ is a collection of vertex disjoint paths $\mathcal{F}$, each of which is directed towards $T'$.
Since each $v'\in V(T')\setminus\{r\}$ has an in-neighbour in $T'$, the paths in $\mathcal{F}$ can only connect to $T'$ via $r$ or a vertex of $U$.
Moreover, the former holds for at most one path $P_r\in \mathcal{F}$.

It follows that the subtree of $T$ induced by $V(T') \cup V(P_r)$ (with $P_r$ possibly empty) is an out-arborescence and can be embedded in $B^+_{k,\ell}$ for some sufficiently large $k$ and $\ell$ such that $U$, the set of leaves of $T'$, maps to the leaves of $B^+_{k,\ell}$.
The remaining paths in $\mathcal{F}$ can be naturally grouped into disjoint in-stars, centred in the vertices of $U$. Increasing the values $k,\ell$ if necessary, we obtain that $T$ is a subgraph of $T(k,\ell)$.
\end{proof}
\noindent
Consequently, in order to prove Theorem~\ref{thm:groundedclass}, it is enough to consider the trees $T = T(k,\ell)$. We now recall the following result from~\cite{aboulker1610subdivisions}, which will play a crucial rule in our proof.  

\begin{proposition}[\cite{aboulker1610subdivisions}]\label{prop:abetal}
There exists a function $f(k,\ell)$ such that every digraph $G$ with $\delta^+(G)\geq f(k,\ell)$ contains $S^-_{k,\ell}$ as a subgraph.     
\end{proposition}

\noindent
Note that the graph $T(k,1)$ is isomorphic to $S^-_{k,2}$, which is known to be $\delta^+$-enforcible by Proposition~\ref{prop:abetal}.
Therefore, we may assume that $\ell \geq 2$.
We shall prove the following quantitative form of Theorem~\ref{thm:groundedclass}.\footnote{For clarity of presentation, we do not attempt to optimise the bounds.}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:supergraph_of_normalized}
    Let $k \geq 1, \ell \geq 2$. Any digraph $G$ with $\delta^+(G) \geq f(k,3k\ell^{k+1})+2k\ell^k$ contains $T(k,\ell)$ as a subgraph.
\end{theorem}
\noindent
In fact, we shall prove a more general theorem stating that if $\delta^+(G)$ is sufficiently large, then $G$ contains a copy of $B^+_{k,\ell}$ whose leaves satisfy any \emph{$\delta^+$-common} vertex property. 

\begin{definition}\label{def:common_property}
    Let $\Pro$ be a vertex property in digraphs.
    We say that $\Pro$ is \emph{$\delta^+$-common} if
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item there is $d = d(\Pro)$ such that every digraph $G$ with $\delta^+(G) \geq d$ contains a vertex satisfying $\Pro$,
        \item $\Pro$ is anti-monotone.
        That is, if $H$ is a subgraph of $G$ and a vertex $v \in V(H)$ satisfies $\Pro$ in $H$, then $v$ satisfies $\Pro$ in $G$.
    \end{enumerate}     
\end{definition}
\noindent
A trivial example of a $\delta^+$-common property is ``$v$ is a vertex.''
A far less trivial (and important for us) $\delta^+$-common property is ``$v$ is the centre of a copy of $S^-_{k,\ell}$.''

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:outstar_with_leaves_property}
    Let $\Pro$ be a $\delta^+$-common property, $k \geq 1, \ell \geq 2$, and let $G$ be a digraph with $\delta^+(G) \geq d(\Pro)+2k\ell^k$. Then $G$ contains a copy $B$ of $B^+_{k,\ell}$ such that all leaves of $B$ satisfy $\Pro$ in $G$.
\end{theorem}
\noindent
Theorem~\ref{thm:supergraph_of_normalized} is a direct corollary of Theorem~\ref{thm:outstar_with_leaves_property}. 
\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:supergraph_of_normalized}]
    Let $h=3k\ell^{k+1}$ and $\Pro$ be the property ``$v$ is the centre of a copy of $S^-_{k,h}$.'' By Proposition~\ref{prop:abetal}, $\Pro$ is $\delta^+$-common with $d(\Pro)=f(k,h)$. 
    Hence, $\delta^+(G) \geq d(\Pro)+2k\ell^k$ and we can apply Theorem~\ref{thm:outstar_with_leaves_property} to find in $G$ a copy $B$ of $B^+_{k,\ell}$, with the set of leaves $L$ of size $\ell^k$, such that each $w\in L$ satisfies $\Pro$ in $G$.
    
    So, each $w\in L$ is the centre of $S(w)$, a copy of $S^-_{k,h}$ in $G$.
    Now, take greedily from each $S(w)$ a subgraph $S'(w)$, a copy of $S^-_{k,\ell}$, such that all $S'(w)$ are disjoint from each other, and each $S'(w)$ is disjoint from $B$ save for $w$ --- together, $B$ and $\{S'(w):w\in L\}$ form a copy of $T(k,\ell)$ in $G$.
    This is possible since, when choosing $S'(w)$, the union of $B$ and all previously chosen $S'(w')$ contains at most 
    \[
        \card{V(B)} + \card{L} k\ell\leq 2\ell^k+k\ell^{k+1}
    \]
    vertices.
    Since each of them, except $w$, belongs to at most one ray of $S(w)$, there remain at least 
    \[
        h - 2\ell^k - k \ell^{k+1} \geq \ell
    \]
    rays of $S(w)$ that may be used to form $S'(w)$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:outstar_with_leaves_property}]
    Let $G=(V,E)$. We will inductively define vertex sets $\Gamma(0), \dots, 
    \Gamma(k)\subseteq V$ that will guide our construction of the subgraph $B$.
    To do so, we define
    \begin{align*}
        \Gamma(0) &= \{ v \in V : \text{$v$ satisfies $\Pro$} \}, \\
        \Gamma(i) &= \{ v \in V : \deg^+_{\Gamma(i-1)}(v) \geq 2\ell^k \}\text{ for $1\leq i \leq k$.}
    \end{align*}
    \noindent
    The significance of the sets $\Gamma(i)$ is given by the following claim.
    
    \begin{claim}\label{claim:Gamma(k)_nonempty_implies_win}
    $\Gamma(k)\neq \emptyset$.
    \end{claim}
    Assuming Claim~\ref{claim:Gamma(k)_nonempty_implies_win}, we conclude the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:outstar_with_leaves_property} as follows. Take some vertex $v\in \Gamma(k)$.
    We construct $B$ greedily from $v$ as the root.       
    For $i=0,\dots,k$ we will inductively construct $B_i$, a copy of $B^+_{i,\ell}$ in $G$, such that the leaves of $B_{i}$ (resp.~the single vertex of $B_0$) belong to $\Gamma(k-i)$.
    In particular, the leaves of $B_k$, a copy of $B^+_{k,\ell}$ in $G$, will satisfy $\Pro$ as they will belong to $\Gamma(0)$, so we can take $B=B_k$.
    
    To construct the trees $B_i$, set $B_0 = \{v\}$ and define $B_1$ to be an out-star with $v$ as the centre and $\ell$ of its out-neighbours in $\Gamma(k-1)$, which exist since $\deg^+_{\Gamma(k-1)}(v) \geq 2\ell^k > \ell$, as leaves.
    Now suppose we have constructed the tree $B_i$ for some $1\leq i \leq k-1$, and let  $L \subseteq \Gamma(k-i)$ be the set of its leaves.
    We have 
    \[
        \card{V(B_i)} = \sum_{j=0}^{i} \ell^j\leq 2\ell^{k-1},
    \]
    while $\deg^+_{\Gamma(k-i-1)}(w) \geq 2\ell^k$ for each $w\in L$. Hence, every $w\in L$ has at least $\ell^k$ neighbours in  $\Gamma(k-i-1)\setminus V(B_i)$. Since $\card{L} \leq \ell^{k-1}$, we can greedily choose for each $w\in L$ a set of $\ell$ out-neighbours in $\Gamma(k-i-1)\setminus V(B_i)$, such that the resulting sets are pairwise disjoint. These sets together with $B_i$ form a copy of $B_{i+1,\ell}^+$ in $G$, whose leaves belong to $\Gamma(k-i-1)$. We take this tree to be $B_{i+1}$.
\end{proof}
  
It remains to prove Claim~\ref{claim:Gamma(k)_nonempty_implies_win}. To this end, we partition the vertices of $G$ according to their presence in the sets $\Gamma(i)$.
That is, for a vertex $v\in V$ and an integer $0\leq i\leq k$, let $z_i(v)=1$ if $v\in \Gamma(i)$, and $z_i(v)=0$ otherwise, and let  $z(v) =(z_0(v),\dots,z_k(v))$. Conversely, for a vector $z =(z_0,\dots,z_k)\in \{0,1\}^{k+1}$ we set
\[
    V_z = \{ v \in V : z=z(v) \}
    .
\]
In this notation, Claim~\ref{claim:Gamma(k)_nonempty_implies_win} states that $V_z\neq \emptyset$ for some $z=(z_0,\dots,z_k)$ with $z_k = 1$.

Denote by $\prec$ the lexicographic ordering on $\{0,1\}^{\{0,\dots,k\}}$.
That is, for two vectors $z=(z_0\dots,z_k)$ and $z'=(z'_0,\dots,z'_k)$, we write $z \prec z'$ if there is an index $0\leq i \leq k$ such that $z_i = 0, z'_i = 1$ and $z_j = z'_j$ for all $j > i$.
We highlight the following property of the ordering.
\begin{observation}\label{obs:lex_order_property}
    If $z' \succ z$ and $z'_k = 0$, then there is an index $ i \leq k-1$ such that $z'_i = 1$ and $z_{i+1} = 0$.
\end{observation}
\noindent
We denote by $\vec{0}$ the all-zero vector $\vec{0} \in \{0,1\}^{k+1}$, and put $X=V_{\vec{0}}=V\setminus\bigcup_{i=0}^k\Gamma(i)$.

\begin{proof}[Proof of Claim~\ref{claim:Gamma(k)_nonempty_implies_win}]
    Suppose for a contradiction that $\Gamma_k=\emptyset$, or equivalently, 
    $V_{z'}=\emptyset$ for all $z'=(z'_0,\dots,z'_{k-1},1)$. Let $z =(z_0,\dots,z_k)$ be the $\prec$-smallest vector such that $V_z \not= \emptyset$; by the above assumption we have $z_k=0$. Let 
    \[
        I=\Big\{i \in \{0,\dots, k-1\}: z_{i+1}=0\Big\} \ \ \text{and} \ \
        W=\bigcup_{i\in I}\Gamma(i).
    \]
    We claim that
    \begin{align*}
        V =
        \begin{cases}
            W        &\text{ if } z \not= \vec{0},\\
            W \cup X &\text{ if } z = \vec{0}.
        \end{cases}
    \end{align*}
    Indeed, $\{V_{z'}:z'\in \{0,1\}^{k+1}\}$ is a partition of $V$, and for a vector $z'=(z'_0,\dots,z'_k)$, we have the following options:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item if $z'_k = 1$, then $V_{z'} = \emptyset$ by assumption,
        \item if $z' \prec z$, we have $V_{z'} = \emptyset$ by the minimality of $z$,
        \item if $z' \succ z$ and $z'_k = 0$, then, by Observation~\ref{obs:lex_order_property}, for some $0\leq i \leq k-1$ we have $z'_i = 1$ and $z_{i+1} = 0$ . Therefore, $i\in I$ and $V_{z'} \subseteq \Gamma(i)\subseteq W$,
        \item lastly, if $z' = z \not= \vec{0}$, then, as $z_k=0$, for some $0\leq i \leq k-1$ we have $z_i = 1$ and $z_{i+1} = 0$. Therefore, $i\in I$ and $V_{z'} \subseteq \Gamma(i)\subseteq W$.
    \end{enumerate}
\noindent
    Let now $v\in V_z$ be an arbitrary vertex (recall that $V_z\neq \emptyset$ by definition of the vector $z$).
    For each $i\in I$ we have $v\notin \Gamma(i+1)$, as $z_{i+1}=0$. Hence,
    $\deg^+_{\Gamma(i)}(v)<2\ell^k$. Taking the sum over all $i\in I$ gives 
    \[
        \deg^+_W(v) < 2k\ell^k.
    \]
    So, if $z \not= \vec{0}$, then due to $V=W$, we get 
    \[
        2k\ell^k > \deg^+_W(v) = \deg^+(v) \geq \delta^+(G) \geq 2k\ell^k,
    \]
    a contradiction. 
    
    \noindent
    While if $z = \vec{0}$, we obtain 
    \[
        d_X^+(v) \geq \delta^+(G) - \deg^+_W(v) \geq \delta^+(G) - 2k\ell^k \geq d(\Pro).
    \]
    Since in this case $v$ was an arbitrary vertex of $V_z=V_{\vec{0}}=X$, it follows that the induced subgraph $G[X]$ satisfies $\delta^+(G[X]) \geq d(\Pro)$. Thus, there is a vertex $x \in X$ that satisfies the property $\Pro$ in $G[X]$.
    However, by the antimonotonicity of $\Pro$, $x$ must also satisfy $\Pro$ in $G$, meaning $x\in \Gamma(0)$. This is a contradiction with the fact that
    \[
        x \in X =V_{\vec{0}}\subseteq V\setminus \Gamma(0).
    \]
    Hence, our initial assumption that $\Gamma(k)=0$ was contradictory, and we must have $\Gamma(k)\neq 0$. 
\end{proof}\section{Giant spiders exist}\label{sec:spiders}

In this section we prove Theorem~\ref{thm:linear_spiders}, which gives a linear bound on the minimum out-degree that guarantees a copy of $\smtwol$.

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:linear_spiders}]
    Let $\ell\geq 1$ be fixed and $G = (V, E)$ be a digraph with $\delta^+(G) \geq d$, where $d> \left(\frac{3+\sqrt{17}}{2} \right)\ell$. By removing edges if necessary, we may assume that $\deg^+(v) = d$ for every vertex $v \in V$. We remark that this seemingly insignificant assumption is crucial for our argument. Our goal is to find a copy of $\smtwol$ in $G$. To this end, we partition $V$ into subsets $A$ and $B$, where 
    $$A = \{v \in V : \deg^-(v) \geq 2\ell\} \ \ \text{ and} \ \ B =\{v \in V : \deg^-(v) < 2\ell\},$$
    and note that $A\neq \emptyset$, since the average in-degree in $G$ is $d>2\ell$.

    If there exists a vertex $r \in A$ such that $\deg^-_A(r) \geq 2\ell$, we exhibit a copy of $\smtwol$ in $G$ by choosing greedily distinct vertices $a_1, x_1, a_2,x_2,\dots, a_\ell, x_\ell \in V$, such that $a_i\in N^-_A(r)$ and $x_i\in N^-_V(a_i)$.
    We will not run out of vertices: having chosen $a_1, x_1, \dots, a_i,x_i$ for some $0 \leq i < \ell$, $a_{i+1} \in A$ can be picked distinctly  because $r$ has at least $2\ell$ in-neighbours in $A$ and at most $2i<2\ell$ of them have already been chosen.
    Similarly, $x_{i+1}$ can be picked distinctly since $a_{i+1} \in A$ has at least $2\ell$ in-neighbours and at most $2i+1<2\ell$ of them have already been chosen. 

    Thus, for the rest of the proof we may assume that $\deg^-_A(v) \leq 2\ell-1$ for every $v \in A$. For three sets $X,Y,Z \subseteq V$, not necessarily distinct, we denote by $X \rightarrow Y \rightarrow Z$ the set of all $2$-edge directed paths, with the vertex set $\{x,y,z\}$ for some $x \in X$, $y\in Y$, and $z \in Z$ and the edges $\{(x,y),(y,z)\}$.

    \begin{figure}[htbp]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{fig_VBA_paths.pdf}
        \caption{An example of two paths in $V \rightarrow B \rightarrow A$, one starting in $B$ and the other in $A$.}
    \end{figure}
    
    Observe that
    \begin{align*}
        \card{V \rightarrow B \rightarrow A} &=  \card{V \rightarrow B \rightarrow V} - \card{V \rightarrow B \rightarrow B}\\
        &= \card{A \rightarrow B \rightarrow V} + \card{B \rightarrow B \rightarrow V} - \card{V \rightarrow B \rightarrow B}\\
        &= \card{A \rightarrow V \rightarrow V} - \card{A \rightarrow A \rightarrow V} + \card{B \rightarrow B \rightarrow V} - \card{V \rightarrow B \rightarrow B}, 
    \end{align*}
    and let us estimate the terms in the last expression.
    Because $\deg^+(v)=d$ for all $v$, $\deg^-_A(v) \leq 2\ell-1$ for every $v \in A$, and $\deg^-(v) \leq 2\ell-1$ for every $v \in B$, we obtain:
    \begin{align*}
        \card{A \rightarrow V \rightarrow V} &\geq \card{A} d(d-1), \\
        \card{A \rightarrow A \rightarrow V} &\leq e(G[A]) d \leq (2\ell-1) d\card{A}, \\
        \card{B \rightarrow B \rightarrow V} &\geq e(G[B])(d-1), \\
        \card{V \rightarrow B \rightarrow B} &\leq e(G[B])(2\ell-1).
    \end{align*}
    Hence
    \begin{align*}
        \card{V \rightarrow B \rightarrow A} &\geq d(d-1)\card{A} - (2\ell-1) d\card{A} + e(G[B])(d-1) - e(G[B])(2\ell-1) \\
            &\geq d(d - 2\ell )\card{A} + e(G[B])(d - 2\ell)\\
            &\geq d(d - 2\ell)\card{A}.
    \end{align*} 
    By the pigeonhole principle, there exists a vertex $a \in A$ such that 
    \[
        \card{V \rightarrow B \rightarrow \{a\}} \geq d(d-2\ell).
    \]

    Let $s$ be maximal such that there exists $S=\{b_1,\dots,b_s\}\subseteq N_B^-(a)$ and $Q=\{q_1,\dots,q_s\}\subseteq V\setminus (S\cup \{a\})$ with $(q_i,b_i)\in E$ for all $1\leq i\leq s$. Note that this gives a copy of $S^-_{2,s}$ in $G$. Since the in-degrees in $B$ are at most $2\ell$, we have 
    \[
        \card{V \rightarrow S \rightarrow \{a\}} \leq 2 \ell s,
    \]
    and consequently
    \[
        \card{V \rightarrow B\setminus S \rightarrow \{a\}} \geq  d(d-2\ell) - 2\ell s.
    \]
    By maximality of $s$, all these paths have their first vertex in $Q$.
    Hence, for some $1\leq i\leq s$ we have
    \[
        d=\deg^+(q_i)\geq \card{\{q_i\}\rightarrow B\setminus S \rightarrow \{a\}} \geq \frac{d(d-2\ell) - 2\ell s}{s},
    \]
    resulting in 
    \[
        s\geq \frac{d(d-2\ell)}{d+2\ell}.
    \]
    The last expression is greater than $\ell$ for $d>\left(\frac{3+\sqrt{17}}{2}\right)\ell$, since $\frac{3+\sqrt{17}}{2}$ is the positive root of the underlying quadratic equation. Thus, $G$ contains a copy of $\smtwol$.
\end{proof}
