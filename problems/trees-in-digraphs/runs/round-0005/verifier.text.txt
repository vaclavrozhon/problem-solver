{"feedback_md":"The core improvements are now rigorous and consistent. The variable-threshold Γ-scheme with t_{k−i}=ℓ^{i+1}+⌈(ℓ^{i+1}−1)/(ℓ−1)⌉ (and t_k=ℓ) is correct; the lexicographic argument and the depth-greedy extension both check out. This removes the linear-in-k factor, giving S_{k,ℓ}=Θ_ℓ(ℓ^k), and the constants have been standardized (notably S_{k,2}=4·2^k−k−5). Please keep this exact ℓ=2 formula; earlier “−4−k” was off by 1.\n\nRay packing: the exact, tight greedy threshold is h ≥ (|V(B)|−1)+(|L|−1)·kℓ+ℓ with |V(B)|=(ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1), |L|=ℓ^k. This improves both 3kℓ^{k+1} and the coarser kℓ^{k+1}+2ℓ^k+ℓ; it also refines the previously stated kℓ^{k+1} + (ℓ^{k+1}−1)/(ℓ−1) + ℓ by an additive kℓ and an exact −1.

For any u∈V(H), deg^+_H(u) ≥ deg^+_G(u)−|F| ≥ δ^+(G)−|F| ≥ d(P). Hence δ^+(H) ≥ d(P), so H contains a vertex v satisfying P in H by δ+-commonness. Since P is anti-monotone, v also satisfies P in G.
