Model and definitions
- Graphs: finite, simple, maximum degree Δ < ∞ (bounded degree). Nodes have unique IDs from a polynomial range (standard LOCAL assumptions). dist(·,·) is the hop distance; B(v,r) is the radius-r ball around v.
- LCL Π: a locally checkable labeling problem with constant checkability radius r_Π.
- Order-robust sequential rules with bounded writes: A deterministic rule S with read radius R and write radius W is a procedure that, when processing v in a vertex order σ, inspects G[B(v,R)] and the outputs already fixed in B(v,R) ∩ {earlier vertices in σ}, and may irrevocably write outputs on any currently-unset vertices in B(v,W). The final labeling must satisfy Π for every σ. (The special case W=0 writes only at v.)
- Online-LOCAL(t): vertices arrive one by one; at each step the algorithm executes t synchronous LOCAL rounds on the subgraph induced by the arrived vertices; outputs are irrevocable; nodes may maintain arbitrary local state across steps unless otherwise restricted.
- Output-only Online-LOCAL(t): the only persistent state is the immutable output label after it is set; in any t-round window, messages and local computation at a node may depend on the graph and currently known outputs within distance ≤ t from that node, but not on any other mutable state.
- t-local-dependence (at v): upon v’s arrival, its output depends only on the induced arrived subgraph and previously fixed outputs within B(v,t).
- Output-only, W-write Online-LOCAL(t): as output-only above, but when v arrives the algorithm may irrevocably fix outputs on any vertices in B(v,W).

Lemma 1 (Power-graph coloring in O(k log* n))
Statement. Let G be a bounded-degree graph and k ≥ 1 a constant. There is a deterministic LOCAL algorithm that computes a proper vertex coloring of the power graph G^k with at most C = Δ^{O(k)} colors in O(k log* n) rounds on G.
Proof. Standard: simulate an O(log* n)-round O(Δ(G^k)^2)-coloring on G^k by k rounds per step on G; Δ(G^k) ≤ Δ^k, hence C = Δ^{O(k)}. □

Lemma 2 (Color-phased simulation for W=0)
Statement. Let S be an order-robust sequential rule with read radius r that writes only at the current node (W=0). Given a proper coloring of G^r, processing colors 1,…,C in order reproduces S for any order respecting the color layering, using O(r) rounds per color.
Proof. If φ(u)=φ(v) then dist(u,v)>r, hence the decisions in phase i depend only on outputs from earlier colors and do not interfere. Each node gathers outputs in B(·,r) from earlier colors in O(r) rounds and applies S. □

Theorem A (Sequential-local (W=0) ⇒ LOCAL)
Statement. If Π admits an order-robust r-local sequential algorithm (W=0), then Π has a deterministic LOCAL algorithm running in O(r log* n + Δ^{O(r)}·r) rounds. For constant Δ,r: O(log* n).
Proof. Compute a G^r-coloring in O(r log* n) rounds (Lemma 1), then simulate by Lemma 2. □

Lemma 3 (Output-only Online-LOCAL(t), W=0 ⇒ sequential with read radius 2t)
Statement. If Π has a deterministic output-only Online-LOCAL(t) algorithm correct for every arrival order, then Π admits an order-robust sequential algorithm with read radius 2t (W=0) that reproduces the online outputs for any order.
Proof. Fix order σ. When v_i arrives online under σ, only nodes in B(v_i,t) can send messages that reach v_i within t rounds. Under output-only, any such message depends only on outputs within the sender’s B(·,t), all contained in B(v_i,2t). Hence v_i’s t-window transcript and output are functions of the restriction to B(v_i,2t) of the arrived subgraph and outputs. Define the sequential rule to read those and return the same output as the online algorithm would under σ. Correctness and order-robustness follow. □

Lemma 4 (Bridge under t-local-dependence, W=0)
Statement. If Π has a deterministic Online-LOCAL(t) algorithm with t-local-dependence (at every v) that is correct for every arrival order, then Π admits an order-robust sequential algorithm with read radius t (W=0).
Proof. As in Lemma 3, but with t in place of 2t by hypothesis. □

Corollary A (Bounded-degree trees, constant r or t)
Statement. On bounded-degree trees, if Π has either (i) an order-robust r-local sequential algorithm (W=0) with constant r, or (ii) an output-only Online-LOCAL(t) algorithm (W=0) with constant t, or (iii) an Online-LOCAL(t) algorithm with t-local-dependence and constant t, then Π has a deterministic LOCAL algorithm with round complexity O(log* n).
Proof. Combine Theorem A with Lemma 3 or Lemma 4 as applicable; Δ and radii are constants. □

Lemma 5 (Color-phased simulation with bounded writes)
Statement. Let S be an order-robust sequential rule with read radius R and write radius W ≥ 0 (S may write outputs on currently-unset vertices in B(v,W)). Let φ be a proper coloring of G^{K} with K = max(2W, R+W). Then processing colors 1,…,C in order reproduces S for any order that respects the color layering. The per-color communication cost is O(R) rounds after φ is known.
Proof. If φ(u)=φ(v) then dist(u,v) > K ≥ 2W and > R+W. Thus (i) B(u,W) ∩ B(v,W) = ∅ (no write–write conflicts) and (ii) B(u,R) ∩ B(v,W) = ∅ and B(v,R) ∩ B(u,W) = ∅ (no read–write interference). In phase i, each vertex v with φ(v)=i gathers outputs written by earlier colors within B(v,R) and computes its writes; because of (i)–(ii), these writes are independent across same-color vertices and depend only on earlier colors, so the result matches S for any order that lists all lower colors first and then the current color in any internal order. O(R) rounds suffice to gather B(v,R) information. Computing φ takes O(K log* n) rounds by Lemma 1 with k=K. □

Lemma 6 (Output-only, W-write Online-LOCAL(t) ⇒ sequential with (R,W)=(2t+W,W))
Statement. If Π has a deterministic output-only, W-write Online-LOCAL(t) algorithm A correct for every arrival order, then Π admits a deterministic order-robust sequential rule S that, when processing v, reads only B(v, 2t+W), may write on currently-unset vertices in B(v,W), and reproduces A’s outputs for any order.
Proof. Fix order σ = (v_1,…,v_n). Consider A under arrival order σ. When v_i arrives, during its t-round window only nodes within distance ≤ t of the patch B(v_i,W) can send messages that reach the patch; hence all influencing senders lie in N := B(B(v_i,W), t) = B(v_i, W+t). Under output-only, messages sent by any u ∈ N depend only on outputs within B(u,t). Therefore the union of outputs that can affect the patch’s decisions lies in M := ⋃_{u∈N} B(u,t) = B(v_i, W+2t). Consequently, the t-round transcript determining the patch outputs in the σ-run is a function of the restriction of the arrived subgraph and already-fixed outputs to B(v_i, 2t+W). Define S as follows: when processing v_i under σ, S collects the already-fixed outputs within B(v_i, 2t+W) ∩ {v_1,…,v_{i-1}} and deterministically reproduces A’s t-window decisions on the patch given that local view, writing only to vertices in B(v_i,W) whose outputs are not yet fixed. Because A is deterministic and respects irrevocability, this reproduces exactly the same patch outputs as A under σ and never overwrites. As A is correct for every order, S is an order-robust (R,W)-local rule with R=2t+W. □

Corollary B (Bounded-degree trees, output-only W-write ⇒ O(log* n) LOCAL)
Statement. On bounded-degree trees, if Π has a deterministic output-only, W-write Online-LOCAL(t) algorithm with constants t,W, then Π has a deterministic LOCAL algorithm with round complexity O(log* n).
Proof. Apply Lemma 6 to obtain a sequential (R,W)-rule with R=2t+W. Then use Lemma 5 with K = max(2W, R+W) = max(2W, 2t+2W) = 2t+2W to simulate S in the LOCAL model: compute a proper coloring of G^{2t+2W} in O((2t+2W) log* n) rounds, then spend O(R)=O(2t+W) rounds per color. For constant Δ,t,W the total is O(log* n). □

Lemma 7 (2t-commutativity of independent consecutive arrivals)
Statement. Let A be any deterministic Online-LOCAL(t) algorithm (unrestricted mutable state). Consider an arrival sequence σ and two consecutive arrival steps at vertices u and w such that dist(u,w) > 2t. Let σ′ be obtained by swapping these two steps. Then, after these two steps, the states and fixed outputs at all vertices are identical under σ and under σ′.
Proof. Let G_i be the arrived subgraph just before these two steps. In the step when u arrives under σ, A executes t synchronous rounds on G_i ∪ {u}. Messages can traverse at most t hops per window, so only nodes in B(u,t) can be influenced (either by receiving messages or by depending on received messages); nodes outside B(u,t) undergo the same deterministic state updates as they would in any window where they receive the same (empty) messages. Likewise, w’s step affects only B(w,t). Because dist(u,w) > 2t, the balls B(u,t) and B(w,t) are disjoint, and w is absent during u’s step and u is absent during w’s step in both σ and σ′. Therefore the t-round transcripts and resulting updates within B(u,t) (resp. B(w,t)) are identical in σ and σ′, and all other vertices experience no message-dependent changes in either order. Thus the combined effect of the two steps commutes. □

Corollary 7.1 (Pushing far-away arrivals past v)
Statement. Fix v and any arrival sequence. By repeatedly swapping consecutive independent steps via Lemma 7, one can transform the sequence into another in which all vertices at distance > 2t from v arrive after v, without changing any states or outputs within B(v,t) at the time v arrives (or thereafter).
Proof. Iteratively swap any arrival at distance > 2t from v forward past earlier arrivals until it occurs after v; Lemma 7 ensures the swaps preserve the relevant states/outputs. □

Remark. Lemma 5 supersedes the earlier, flawed variant that required only a G^{R+W}-coloring; the counterexample R=0, W=1 on a 3-path shows that G^{R+W} is insufficient because write–write conflicts may occur.
Remark (No faithful t-per-color batching for unrestricted Online-LOCAL(t)). There exists a deterministic Online-LOCAL(1) algorithm A and a valid color-by-color arrival order σ_φ (induced by a proper coloring φ of G^2 on a path) such that any LOCAL simulation that processes all vertices of the same color class simultaneously in O(1) rounds cannot reproduce the exact outputs produced by A under the sequential σ_φ-run.
Proof. Consider the trivial LCL Π that accepts any labeling. Algorithm A maintains at each arrived node a parity bit p (initially 0) that toggles at every arrival step (regardless of messages). When a new vertex v arrives, in its 1-round window it reads p from an already-arrived neighbor if one exists and outputs that bit (if v has no arrived neighbor, it outputs 0). Fix any proper 3-coloring φ of the path’s G^2 and let σ_φ process colors 1,2,3 in order, with any internal order inside a color. In the sequential σ_φ-run, the parity p toggles at every arrival, hence the outputs of the vertices of any color class alternate with the internal order. In contrast, if one processes all vertices of a color class simultaneously in a single 1-round batch (keeping not-yet-processed colors absent), all these vertices observe the same parity p from earlier colors and therefore all output the same bit. Thus the batched simulation does not reproduce A’s outputs under σ_φ. □

Remark (Complexity accounting for Lemma 5/Corollary B). On bounded-degree graphs with constants t,W, the coloring step on G^{K} (K = max(2W, R+W), with R = 2t+W in Corollary B) costs O(K·log* n) rounds and yields C = Δ^{O(K)} colors; the per-color work is O(R). Hence the total complexity is O(log* n), dominated by the coloring step.
Definition (Quiescent Online-LOCAL(t) and (W,t)-quiescent)
Consider the standard LOCAL timing in an arrival step: in each of t synchronous rounds, each arrived node first sends messages as a (deterministic) function of its current state, then receives messages from neighbors, and finally updates its state as a (deterministic) function of its current state and the received messages.
- An Online-LOCAL(t) algorithm A is quiescent if, upon the arrival of v, during the ensuing t rounds every node u with dist(u,v) > t does not change its state in any of these t rounds.
- More generally, A is (W,t)-quiescent if, upon the arrival of v, during the ensuing t rounds only nodes in the active region B(v, W+t) may change their state; nodes outside B(v,W+t) do not change state.

Lemma 8 (Quiescent Online-LOCAL(t) ⇒ O(log* n) LOCAL; bounded-writes variant)
Let Π be an LCL on bounded-degree graphs. Suppose Π has a deterministic quiescent Online-LOCAL(t) algorithm A with constant t.
(i) Then Π admits a deterministic LOCAL algorithm with round complexity O((2t+1)·log* n + t·Δ^{O(t)}) = O(log* n).
(ii) More generally, if A is (W,t)-quiescent with constants W,t, then Π admits a deterministic LOCAL algorithm with round complexity O((2t+2W+1)·log* n + t·Δ^{O(t+W)}) = O(log* n).

Proof.
Fix K := 2t+1 in case (i), and K := 2t+2W+1 in case (ii). By Lemma 1, compute a proper coloring φ of G^{K} with C = Δ^{O(K)} colors in O(K·log* n) rounds. We process the colors in increasing order i = 1,2,…,C in phases; at the start of phase i, exactly the vertices of colors < i are considered “already arrived,” and vertices of colors ≥ i are “not yet arrived.”

In phase i we simulate, in parallel, the t-round online arrival window of every vertex v with φ(v)=i, on the subgraph induced by vertices of colors ≤ i, as follows: (a) we declare all vertices of color i to “arrive” at the beginning of the phase, and (b) we perform t synchronous LOCAL rounds on that induced subgraph. During this phase, the algorithm A is executed faithfully at every vertex, except that vertices of colors > i are absent.

Let R_v denote the active region of v during this phase: R_v = B(v,t) in case (i) and R_v = B(v, W+t) in case (ii). Because φ colors G^{K} with K as above, for any two distinct same-color vertices v,w we have dist(v,w) ≥ K+1, hence dist(R_v, R_w) ≥ 2. In particular, there is no edge between R_v and R_w.

Quiescence and the LOCAL timing imply two key facts within phase i:
1) Only nodes in R := ⋃_{φ(v)=i} R_v may change state during the t rounds of phase i; all nodes outside R keep their state fixed throughout the phase. Since messages sent in a round depend only on the sender’s current state at the start of that round, such outside nodes cannot forward newly received information in subsequent rounds. Consequently, there is no causal influence along any path that leaves one R_v and re-enters another R_w within the t rounds, because such a path must traverse at least one node outside R which cannot propagate new information.
2) Since dist(R_v, R_w) ≥ 2, there is neither an edge nor a length-1 path between distinct active regions.

From 1)–2) it follows that, during phase i, the evolution of each R_v is identical to what would occur if we executed only v’s t-round window in isolation (with all other color-i vertices absent), given the same boundary states on the external neighborhood of R_v (which are precisely the states fixed by earlier colors). Formally, this can be proved by induction on the round counter r=1,…,t, using the domain-of-dependence that is confined to R_v together with outside nodes whose states remain constant.

Therefore, the combined effect of phase i equals the composition of the individual “v-arrival” windows over all vertices v with φ(v)=i, in any internal order. By induction on i, after finishing phase i the global state/output coincides with the online execution that processes first all color-1 vertices (in an arbitrary order), then all color-2 vertices, and so on. Since A is correct for every arrival order, the final labeling after phase C is legal for Π.

The complexity is O(K·log* n) to obtain φ and t rounds per color, i.e., O(t·C) additional rounds. For constant Δ, t, W, we have C = Δ^{O(K)} = O(1), so the total is O(log* n). □

Remark (on the choice of K). The choice K = 2t (resp. 2t+2W) is insufficient for the parallel phase: if dist(v,w)=2t+1 (resp. 2t+2W+1), then R_v and R_w are disjoint but may be adjacent by an edge, allowing one-round coupling between the two active regions. The value K = 2t+1 (resp. 2t+2W+1) guarantees dist(R_v, R_w) ≥ 2, which prevents such coupling and makes the above proof sound.

Remark after Lemma 7 (idle updates depending on step index). In Lemma 7, nodes outside B(u,t) ∪ B(w,t) may perform deterministic updates that depend on the global step counter but not on messages. When two consecutive arrivals at u and w with dist(u,w) > 2t are swapped, those nodes still undergo the same two consecutive step indices in the same order, so their pair of updates is unchanged. This clarifies that Lemma 7 tolerates such idle updates.
Lemma 9 (Strong witness-localization at a vertex)
Statement. Let A be any deterministic Online-LOCAL(t) algorithm on a bounded-degree graph G, let σ be any arrival sequence, and let v be any vertex. There exists an arrival sequence σ_v obtained from σ by repeatedly swapping adjacent arrivals such that:
(i) Every vertex that arrives before v in σ_v lies in B(v,2t).
(ii) The arrived subgraph just before v arrives in σ_v equals the restriction to B(v,2t) of the arrived subgraph just before v arrives in σ (i.e., the set of predecessors of v inside B(v,2t) is unchanged).
(iii) The entire state and the fixed outputs on B(v,t) at the moment v arrives are identical under σ and under σ_v.

Proof. Starting from σ, repeatedly swap v with its immediate predecessor u whenever dist(u,v) > 2t. Each such swap is between two consecutive arrivals u and v whose t-neighborhoods are disjoint; by Lemma 7 (2t-commutativity), the global state after these two steps is identical independent of their order. After no more such swaps are possible, every predecessor of v has distance ≤ 2t from v, proving (i). During this process, we swap v only with vertices at distance > 2t, so the set of predecessors of v within B(v,2t) is unchanged, and therefore the arrived subgraph in B(v,2t) just before v is the same as in σ; this is (ii). Property (iii) follows because each swap preserves the state on B(v,t) (by Lemma 7), and hence the state on B(v,t) at the time v arrives is invariant under the sequence of swaps. □

Claim 8.1 (Phase-locality under (W,t)-quiescence; to be used within Lemma 8).
Fix a proper coloring φ of G^{K} with K = 2t+2W+1 and consider phase i of the simulation in Lemma 8, where all vertices v with φ(v)=i “arrive” simultaneously and we run t synchronous LOCAL rounds on the subgraph induced by colors ≤ i. For each such v, let R_v = B(v, W+t). Then, during phase i:
(a) Only nodes in R := ⋃_{φ(v)=i} R_v may change state; nodes outside R keep their state fixed throughout the phase.
(b) For each v, the t-round transcript (states and messages) on R_v depends only on A and on the initial states on R_v together with the states on the external neighborhood ∂R_v at the start of the phase (i.e., after phase i−1), and is identical to the transcript obtained by executing only v’s t-round window in isolation with those boundary states.
(c) The combined effect of the phase equals the composition, in any order, of the individual arrival windows of the vertices with φ(v)=i.

Proof. Because φ is a proper coloring of G^{K} with K = 2t+2W+1, any distinct same-color vertices v,w satisfy dist(v,w) ≥ K+1, hence dist(R_v,R_w) ≥ (K+1) − 2(W+t) = 2; in particular, there is no edge between R_v and R_w. By (W,t)-quiescence, during the t rounds of the phase only nodes within distance ≤ t of B(v,W) for some v with φ(v)=i may change state; the union of these sets is precisely R, proving (a). Under the standard LOCAL timing (in each round: send based only on the current state; then receive; then update), a node whose state does not change in a given round cannot make its outgoing messages depend on newly received information in later rounds unless its state changes; thus nodes outside R cannot relay any information originating in one active region to another during the phase. An induction on the round counter r=1,…,t shows that the state/message evolution on each R_v is identical to the evolution when executing only v’s t-round window with the same boundary states (states on ∂R_v are fixed by (a)), establishing (b). Since there is no causal influence between distinct active regions within the phase and no edge between them, the per-region effects commute, yielding (c). □

Remark (Why no +1 in Corollary B but +1 in Lemma 8). In Corollary B we first derive a sequential (R,W)-rule with R = 2t+W from the output-only online algorithm, and then simulate this sequential rule using a proper coloring of G^{K} with K = max(2W, R+W). This simulation does not execute concurrent online t-windows; independence is guaranteed by avoiding read–write and write–write conflicts for the sequential rule, and no extra +1 is needed. In contrast, Lemma 8 batches online t-windows of the same color in parallel; to prevent even a single cross-edge between distinct active regions during the t rounds, we require dist(R_v,R_w) ≥ 2, which is ensured by K = 2t+2W+1 (the +1 is necessary).
Lemma S (Adversarial schedule-localization for an edge)
Statement. Let A be any deterministic Online-LOCAL(t) algorithm (t ≥ 1) on a bounded-degree graph G, and let e = uv be an edge. Consider any edge-decided LCL semantics in which the label of e is irrevocably fixed at the time the second endpoint of e arrives. Then there exists an arrival sequence σ(e) with the following properties:
(i) All vertices in the ball B(e,2t) arrive before any vertex outside B(e,2t).
(ii) The second endpoint of e arrives within this prefix, so that e’s label is decided within the prefix.
(iii) The entire online execution of A up to the decisive moment for e depends only on the labeled type of B(e,2t) (graph structure, port colors, IDs) and on the internal arrival order of the vertices of B(e,2t); vertices outside B(e,2t) are absent and cannot affect the transcript.

Proof. Fix any ordering τ of the vertices of B(e,2t) in which the second endpoint of e appears last. Define σ(e) by listing the vertices of B(e,2t) according to τ, followed by all vertices of G \ B(e,2t) in any order. During the prefix consisting of B(e,2t), the arrived subgraph equals the induced subgraph on B(e,2t), and each arrival triggers t synchronous LOCAL rounds on that subgraph alone; vertices outside B(e,2t) are absent and neither send nor receive messages. The label of e is decided when its second endpoint arrives (the last vertex of the prefix), and the decision depends only on the labeled type of B(e,2t) and on the internal arrival order τ. This establishes (i)–(iii). □
Addendum to model for the lower-bound lemmas (port numbering and edge-decided semantics)
- We assume port numbering at each node: the incident edges at a node w are distinguished by ports 1,…,deg(w). This is standard in LCL formulations and lets us identify “an outward port at w.”
- Edge-decided semantics for sinkless orientation: the orientation of an edge e=uv is irrevocably fixed at the time the second endpoint of e arrives. (This convention was already used in Lemma S.)

New lemmas and propositions
- Lemma S_node (Node-local adversarial scheduling). For any deterministic Online-LOCAL(t) algorithm A on a bounded-degree graph G and any vertex w, there exists an arrival sequence in which all vertices of U_w := ⋃_{e∋w} B(e,2t) arrive before any vertex outside U_w. In such a run, up to the time when all edges incident to w have been decided (i.e., once both endpoints of each incident edge have arrived), the transcript and the decisions on those edges depend only on the labeled isomorphism type X_w of U_w and on the internal arrival order on U_w; vertices outside U_w are absent and irrelevant up to that time.
  Proof. Let τ be any ordering of the vertices of U_w in which, for every edge e incident to w, the second endpoint of e appears before τ ends. Define the global arrival order by listing U_w according to τ, then all other vertices. During the prefix U_w, the arrived subgraph equals the induced subgraph on U_w; non-U_w vertices are absent and neither send nor receive messages. By edge-decided semantics, every incident edge to w is decided within this prefix. Hence the transcript up to that time and the decisions on those edges depend only on X_w and the internal order τ. □

- Lemma T (Node-centered admissible outward ports; nonemptiness). Consider sinkless orientation under edge-decided semantics and a deterministic Online-LOCAL(t) algorithm A on bounded-degree graphs. For a node w with type X_w (the labeled isomorphism type of U_w := ⋃_{e∋w} B(e,2t) rooted at w), define
  T_w(X_w) := { p ∈ Ports(w) : there exists an internal arrival order τ on U_w, with the outside absent, such that when all edges incident to w have been decided in the τ-run, the edge on port p is oriented out of w }.
  Then T_w(X_w) is well defined (depends only on X_w) and T_w(X_w) ≠ ∅ for every X_w.
  Proof. Well definedness follows from Lemma S_node: if we list U_w first, then up to the time all edges incident to w are decided, the transcript depends only on X_w and the internal order on U_w, so admissibility of a port p is a property of X_w. For nonemptiness, suppose T_w(X_w)=∅. Then, for every internal order on U_w with the outside absent, all incident edges to w are decided into w by the time they are all decided. Because these decisions are irrevocable, w is permanently a sink in each such run. But these are valid adversarial schedules; thus A would be incorrect on some arrival order, contradicting correctness. Hence T_w(X_w) ≠ ∅. □
  Remark. If one adopts the standard ID-graph framework (restricting IDs to come from a fixed finite labeled high-girth graph H), the family of possible X_w is finite for fixed Δ and t. We do not need finiteness for Lemma T itself; it becomes useful for iterative elimination.

- Definition (Node→edge derived admissible sets). Given node-level rules X_w ↦ T_w(X_w), define for each edge e=wx the per-edge admissible orientation set
  S_e := { w→x if the port at w towards x lies in T_w(X_w) } ∪ { x→w if the port at x towards w lies in T_x(X_x) }.

- Corollary (Preserved node-side no-sink-in-sets and locality). With S_e as above:
  (a) For every node w, there exists an incident edge e with w→• ∈ S_e.
  (b) S_e depends only on the labeled type of B(e,2t+1).
  Proof. (a) By Lemma T, T_w(X_w) ≠ ∅, so some incident port p at w is admissible, i.e., oriented w→x under some internal order on U_w; by the definition of S_e, w→x ∈ S_{wx}. (b) The type X_w is determined by B(w,2t+1), and X_x by B(x,2t+1). On a tree, U_w ⊆ B(w,2t+1) ⊆ B(e,2t+1) and U_x ⊆ B(x,2t+1) ⊆ B(e,2t+1). Hence X_w and X_x (and therefore S_e) are functions of the labeled type of B(e,2t+1). □

- Proposition (Necessity of the +1 in Lemma 8 for W=0, t=2). There exists a deterministic quiescent Online-LOCAL(2) algorithm A on paths and a phase induced by a proper coloring of G^{2t}=G^4 such that two same-color vertices a and b at distance 5 are processed in the same phase, their active regions R_a=B(a,2) and R_b=B(b,2) are disjoint but adjacent by a single edge (x,y) with x∈R_a, y∈R_b, and within that phase the transcript inside R_a depends on the initial state in R_b (and vice versa). Consequently, K=2t (without the +1) does not guarantee phase independence in Lemma 8.
  Proof. Define A as follows (W=0, quiescent): when a vertex v arrives, run two synchronous LOCAL rounds on the arrived graph. Round 1: every node at distance exactly 2 from v sends its initial bit b(u) (e.g., ID(u) mod 2) to its neighbor toward v; all other nodes send 0. Round 2: each node forwards any bit it received in round 1 one hop toward v; v outputs the XOR of bits received in round 2 (default 0 if none). Only nodes in B(v,2) change state during v’s window, so A is quiescent with t=2. Now fix a proper coloring of G^4 and choose same-color a,b at distance 5 on the path so that R_a and R_b are disjoint and adjacent by a single cross-edge (x,y) with x∈R_a at dist(a,x)=2 and y∈R_b at dist(b,y)=2. In the phase for this color, declare both a and b to arrive simultaneously and execute two rounds. In round 1, y sends b(y) to x across the cross-edge. In round 2, x forwards that bit one hop inward toward a, and it reaches a in two hops in R_a (y→x in round 1, x→a in round 2 via the unique shortest path inside R_a). Thus a’s transcript (and hence its output) depends on b(y), a value from R_b. Symmetrically, b’s transcript depends on b(x). Therefore, with K=2t the per-region transcripts are coupled. If instead K=2t+1, then any two same-color active regions are at distance at least 2 (no cross-edge), and this coupling is impossible, as used in Lemma 8. □
