  "progress_md": "Ideas and goal\n- Target claim (tree version of \u201cspeedup\u201d): Let \u03a0 be an LCL on bounded-degree, unoriented trees. If \u03a0 has a deterministic online-LOCAL algorithm with constant round complexity t = O(1), then \u03a0 has a deterministic LOCAL (standard distributed) algorithm with round complexity O(log* n).\n- Intuition: Fix any online algorithm A that works for every arrival order. We will impose an artificial arrival order derived from a distance-(2t) vertex coloring and then simulate A in phases of colors. Computing such a distance coloring takes O(t\u00b7log* n) rounds in LOCAL on bounded-degree graphs (via Linial\u2019s color reductions on the power graph). The phase-by-phase simulation of A costs O(1) additional rounds since the number of colors is a \u0394^{O(t)} constant. Therefore, total complexity is O(log* n).\n\nModel alignment and assumptions to state precisely\n- Online-LOCAL (deterministic), following Akbari\u2013Eslami\u2013Lievonen\u2013Melnyk\u2013S\u00e4rkij\u00e4rvi\u2013Suomela (ICALP\u201923): vertices arrive in an adversarial order; when a vertex v arrives, edges to previously arrived neighbors are revealed; the algorithm may perform t synchronous LOCAL rounds on the current revealed graph to decide the output for v (deterministically), and outputs are irrevocable. The LCL \u03a0 has checkability radius r\u03a0.\n- LOCAL (deterministic): standard model with unique IDs from poly(n) and synchronous message passing. We are allowed O(log* n) time. Degree \u0394 is a fixed constant (bounded-degree trees).\n- Nonoriented tree: no global edge orientation is given; port numbers may be arbitrary; our construction does not assume any edge orientation.\n\nKey technical ingredients\n1) Distance-power coloring in O(log* n):\n   - For any fixed k = O(1), we can compute a proper coloring of G^k (i.e., nodes at distance \u2264 k get distinct colors) with C = \u0394^{O(k)} colors in O(k\u00b7log* n) LOCAL rounds. This follows by running Linial\u2019s color reduction (Theorem 2.4 in the Rozho\u0148 notes) on the power graph G^k; one round in G^k is simulated by k rounds in G. For bounded \u0394 and fixed k, the number of colors C is a constant independent of n.\n   - Why useful here: If nodes of the same color are at distance > 2t, then their t-hop neighborhoods in G are disjoint. This enables parallel, interference-free simulation of online steps for all nodes of the same color.\n\n2) Color-phased simulation of an online algorithm:\n   - Let A be a deterministic online-LOCAL t-round algorithm for \u03a0 that succeeds for all arrival orders. Compute a distance-(2t) coloring \u03c6: V\u2192[C]. We define a canonical arrival order compatible with \u03c6: all nodes of color 1 arrive first (in any order), then all of color 2, \u2026, up to color C. Since A works for all orders, it works for this order.\n   - We simulate this order in LOCAL as follows. We proceed in phases i = 1,2,\u2026,C.\n     \u2022 In phase i, all nodes v with \u03c6(v)=i simultaneously \u201carrive\u201d and run A for t rounds, but communication is restricted so that they only exchange messages with already \u201carrived\u201d nodes (colors < i) and other newly arrived nodes in their own radius-t neighborhoods. Nodes of colors > i remain passive.\n     \u2022 Because \u03c6 is a distance-(2t) coloring, for any two nodes v,w with \u03c6(v)=\u03c6(w)=i we have dist(v,w)>2t, so B(v,t) and B(w,t) in G are disjoint. Hence their t-round simulations touch disjoint parts of the revealed subgraph and can be done in parallel without conflicts.\n   - Practical implementation detail: To enforce the restriction \u201conly talk to earlier colors\u201d, each node exchanges color values with neighbors, and in phase i, nodes with colors > i simply ignore messages (remain silent). Nodes of color i can collect all needed information from their radius-t region intersected with colors < i.\n\n3) Inductive correctness of the simulation:\n   - Invariant I(i): After phase i, all nodes with colors \u2264 i have outputs exactly matching those produced by running A on the arrival order in which colors 1,\u2026,i have arrived (in any internal order) and other nodes have not arrived yet.\n   - Base i=0: vacuous. \n   - Step i\u2192i+1: For any v with \u03c6(v)=i+1, the t-round transcript available to v during phase i+1 in our simulation depends only on the already fixed outputs of nodes with colors \u2264 i and the structure of the revealed subgraph within distance t from v. This transcript is identical to what A would see when v arrives next in the chosen arrival order, because nodes with colors \u2264 i have already \u201carrived\u201d (their outputs fixed) and nodes with colors > i+1 have not arrived and remain silent. Since simulations of nodes of color i+1 run in disjoint t-neighborhoods, we can fix their outputs simultaneously without interference. Hence I(i+1) holds.\n   - At the end of phase C, all nodes are assigned outputs equal to running A on the full arrival order determined by colors. Since A is correct for any order, the output labeling satisfies \u03a0.\n\n4) Complexity accounting:\n   - Coloring: O(2t\u00b7log* n) = O(log* n) rounds (since t=O(1)). Number of colors C = \u0394^{O(2t)} = constant (independent of n).\n   - Simulation of phases: C phases, each needing t rounds of local messaging restricted to earlier colors. Total O(C\u00b7t) = O(1).\n   - Overall: O(log* n) deterministic LOCAL algorithm.\n\nFormal statement (to be checked and polished)\nTheorem (Online-to-LOCAL speedup on bounded-degree trees). Let \u03a0 be an LCL with checkability radius r\u03a0 on the class of bounded-degree trees (maximum degree \u0394). Suppose \u03a0 has a deterministic online-LOCAL t-round algorithm A for some constant t. Then \u03a0 has a deterministic LOCAL algorithm with round complexity O(log* n).\n\nSketch proof: As above, using a distance-(2t) coloring of G and phase-by-phase simulation of A. The only model-specific subtlety is ensuring that in phase i, nodes with colors > i are silent so the new nodes only access the \u201crevealed\u201d portion, exactly as in the online process. The distance-(2t) coloring guarantees disjointness of the t-neighborhoods of simultaneously arriving nodes, so their simulations are independent. Since A is deterministic and succeeds for all arrival orders, correctness follows for the specific color-induced order.\n\nNotes and why trees/nonorientation\n- The proof as written uses only bounded degree and does not exploit any particular property of trees beyond the bounded degree. Thus, the same speedup holds for general bounded-degree graphs under the same online-LOCAL definition. Since the task asked for trees, we have specialized the statement, but the argument is robust to extension.\n- No global orientation is required anywhere; we do not require rooted trees or consistent port orderings beyond what standard LOCAL presumes.\n\nExamples / sanity checks\n- If \u03a0 is trivial (e.g., a constant labeling), then the construction yields O(log* n) trivially. \n- If \u03a0 is 2-coloring of bipartite trees, and if there existed a deterministic O(1)-round online algorithm, our reduction would produce an O(log* n)-round LOCAL algorithm, which is consistent with the known \u0398(log* n) bounds on cycles/grids and with tree LCL classifications (Theorem 2.33 in the Rozho\u0148 notes).\n\nPotential obstacles and how we address them\n- Does the online algorithm use global knowledge (e.g., n)? In online-LOCAL as per [Akb+23], nodes do not know n, and here t is constant, so our simulation does not require such knowledge.\n- Does it matter that online processes one vertex at a time while we process an entire color class in parallel? No: distance-(2t) separation ensures that nodes in the same color do not interact within t rounds of A. Hence parallelization is safe.\n- Checkability radius r\u03a0: A may decide at v even if some constraints with not-yet-arrived neighbors cannot be checked yet. Our simulation mirrors the exact run of A under the chosen order, so the final labeling is valid by A\u2019s correctness.\n\nPrecise lemmata proposed for formal write-up\n- Lemma 1 (Distance-power coloring): For fixed k and bounded \u0394, there is a deterministic LOCAL algorithm that computes a proper coloring of G^k with \u0394^{O(k)} colors in O(k\u00b7log* n) rounds.\n- Lemma 2 (Phase-locality): If \u03c6 is a proper coloring of G^{2t}, then for any color i, the t-hop neighborhoods B(v,t) for nodes v with \u03c6(v)=i are pairwise disjoint. \n- Lemma 3 (Faithful phase simulation): Given a deterministic online-LOCAL t-round algorithm A and a color order 1,\u2026,C, the phase i simulation in which nodes of color i interact only with nodes of colors < i for t rounds produces exactly the outputs A would produce if nodes arrived in that color order.\n- Theorem (Speedup): Combine Lemmas 1\u20133 and the \u201cworks for all orders\u201d property.\n\nWhy useful here\n- This yields the desired O(log* n) upper bound from any constant-round deterministic online-LOCAL upper bound. It matches the known folklore that order-based/online constant-time local rules can be turned into LOCAL algorithms with only the symmetry-breaking overhead of computing a distance coloring (O(log* n)).\n\nGaps/open points to clarify in the next round\n- Precisely restate the online-LOCAL model we assume (cite [Akb+23]) and check that the above simulation conforms to it (e.g., whether earlier nodes may continue to communicate after committing their outputs; our simulation allows t rounds of interaction per phase, which matches per-arrival t rounds).\n- Fix exact distance parameter for coloring: 2t suffices for independence of t-neighborhoods; if we prefer extra slack, 2t+1 can be used with identical asymptotics.\n- Make explicit the handling of port numbering and input labels in LCL definition; the proof is oblivious to these details.\n\nRelation to literature\n- The simulation mirrors the sequential-to-distributed simulation principle (Theorem 2.5 in the Rozho\u0148 notes) but replaces \u201csequential local\u201d by \u201conline-LOCAL\u201d and avoids network decomposition; distance-power coloring suffices on bounded-degree graphs to get O(log* n). \n- The distance-power coloring step is a direct application of Linial\u2019s O(log* n) coloring reductions on power graphs (Theorem 2.4), and standard \u201csimulate G^k by k rounds in G\u201d.\n\nStatus of outputs\n- There is no output.md provided; hence no existing curated results to correct. The above provides a concrete reduction plan, key lemmata, and a proof skeleton ready to be formalized.\n\nNext steps\n- Write the full formal proof with the three lemmata and the main theorem, with all radii/constants explicit and a rigorous induction over color phases.\n- Add a short discussion that the same argument actually applies to bounded-degree graphs beyond trees, if desired by the project scope.\n- Consider an extension to randomized online algorithms (expecting a similar speedup to randomized LOCAL with O(log* n) or to deterministic LOCAL via derandomization), and map the exact bounds (optional)."
