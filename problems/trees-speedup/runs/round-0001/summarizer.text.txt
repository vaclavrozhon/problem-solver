{"summary_md":"Both prover outputs present the same reduction: any deterministic constant-radius (t=O(1)) online-LOCAL algorithm for an LCL Π on bounded-degree, unoriented trees yields a deterministic LOCAL algorithm with O(log* n) rounds. The pipeline is (1) view the online algorithm as a sequential-local algorithm (order-robust), (2) compute a distance-(2t) coloring of G^{2t} in O(t·log* n) rounds via Linial-style color reduction on the power graph, and (3) simulate the sequential/local run in color phases — vertices of one color run the t-round local decision in parallel because their t-neighborhoods are disjoint. For bounded Δ and constant t this gives O(log* n) total time; the argument needs the online model to succeed for every adversarial arrival order. Action items are to formalize the three lemmas (online⇒sequential, power-graph coloring, color-phased simulation), track constants/auxiliary state, and confirm the exact online-LOCAL definition matches the cited literature.
