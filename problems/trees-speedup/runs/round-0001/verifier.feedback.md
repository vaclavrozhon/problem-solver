High-level assessment
- Both reports are aligned on a natural pipeline: reduce the online notion to a locally sequential rule; compute a distance-power coloring of G^k in O(k log* n); simulate the per-node decisions by color phases; conclude O(log* n) time on bounded-degree trees. This is a well-trodden technique in LOCAL theory.
- However, there is a critical modeling fork. There are (at least) two “online local” notions in the literature:
  1) A sequential local/greedy model (sometimes called LCA or order-oblivious sequential local algorithm): when a vertex v is processed, its decision depends only on the r-hop topology and already fixed outputs within that r-ball; no global mutable state, no messages beyond reading previously fixed outputs. Under this model, the pipeline is sound and easy to formalize.
  2) The Online-LOCAL model of Akbari–Eslami–Lievonen–Melnyk–Särkijärvi–Suomela (ICALP’23): an adversary picks an arrival order; when a vertex arrives, the algorithm is allowed t synchronous LOCAL rounds on the subgraph induced by arrived nodes, and outputs for the new vertex become irrevocable. Crucially, over many arrivals, the total number of communication rounds can grow unbounded (t per arrival), allowing information to propagate arbitrarily far before a given vertex arrives.

Audit of prover 02 (Online-LOCAL, t rounds per arrival)
- The proposed phase simulation uses a distance-(2t) coloring and executes t rounds per color. This guarantees that simultaneously processed vertices do not interfere within t hops. However, it silently compresses many per-arrival t-round windows (potentially Θ(n)) into a single t-round block per color. In the true Online-LOCAL run, before a vertex v arrives, there can be an arbitrary number of earlier arrivals, hence arbitrarily many global t-round windows; messages from arbitrarily far may have propagated into B(v,t) by the time v arrives. The phase simulation does not reproduce this accumulated state; after only one t-round block, the states of nodes in B(v,t) can differ from the states they would have in the genuine online execution under the chosen order. Therefore, the inductive invariant “transcripts are identical to the online run” is not justified under the general Online-LOCAL model.
- Minimal scenario illustrating the gap: Consider a path and t=1. In a genuine online run that processes nearly all nodes on the left before v, the leftmost node’s state can propagate one hop per arrival and reach neighbors of v just before v arrives. The proposed phase simulation gives the left side only O(1) total rounds before v’s phase, so the states seen by v may not match those in the online run. The argument needs an extra condition to rule out such long-range accumulation.

Audit of prover 01 (sequential local/greedy model)
- The bridge “online ⇒ sequential local” (Lemma A) is correct if “online” is understood as: the decision at v depends only on the r-hop neighborhood and previously fixed outputs in that ball, and the algorithm must succeed for every order. Under that assumption, the classical color-phased simulation over a proper G^r coloring works. The proofs of Lemmas B and C are standard: color G^r in O(r log* n) rounds with O(Δ^{O(r)}) colors; then process colors in increasing order, using O(r) rounds per color to collect earlier outputs within distance r; with Δ bounded and r=O(1), total O(log* n).
- One caution: if the sequential rule is allowed to mutate “auxiliary state” on neighbors (not just set the current node’s output), then same-color phases would conflict unless r-balls are disjoint (need G^{2r} coloring). The safer and standard formulation is: the rule at v reads at distance ≤ r but only writes the output at v. I recommend using that formulation.

Conclusions and recommendations
- As written, the Prover 02 proof for the general Online-LOCAL (t rounds per arrival) has a fundamental gap. To salvage it, one must either (i) add an explicit assumption preventing unbounded long-range state accumulation (e.g., the transcript at v upon arrival is a function of the arrived subgraph inside distance ≤ t and the previously fixed outputs in that ball), or (ii) develop a nontrivial scheduling argument showing that for LCLs the long-range accumulation is irrelevant (or can be simulated) — this seems challenging and should be attempted carefully.
- The Prover 01 pipeline is sound under the “sequential local/greedy, r-local, order-robust” model. I recommend we formalize and archive this variant now (done in output.md), and, in parallel, either (A) try to prove a strengthening to the full Online-LOCAL model by introducing an additional notion of temporal locality, or (B) search for a counterexample LCL where Online-LOCAL with constant t outperforms LOCAL in the sense that the above reduction fails.

Concrete next steps
- Precisely fix the model definition you aim to cover. If it is the sequential local/greedy model, we are essentially done; polish constants (use G^r coloring), and ensure the rule writes only at the current node. If it is Online-LOCAL(t), either:
  • Add an assumption: for each arrival of v, the t-round transcript relevant to v is a function of the arrived subgraph inside distance ≤ t and the outputs of those nodes (no dependence on mutable states outside the ball). Under this, the G^{2t} phase simulation becomes valid; or
  • Try to construct a rigorous schedule or padding argument that guarantees the local state within B(v,t) before v’s arrival is independent of far-away arrivals. If impossible, aim for a counterexample.
- Optionally, extend the archived theorem from trees to all bounded-degree graphs (the proof already applies verbatim).
