This is a well-trodden technique in LOCAL theory.\\n- However, there is a critical modeling fork. There are (at least) two “online local” notions in the literature:\\n  1) A sequential local/greedy model (sometimes called LCA or order-oblivious sequential local algorithm): when a vertex v is processed, its decision depends only on the r-hop topology and already fixed outputs within that r-ball; no global mutable state, no messages beyond reading previously fixed outputs. Under this model, the pipeline is sound and easy to formalize.\\n  2) The Online-LOCAL model of Akbari–Eslami–Lievonen–Melnyk–Särkijärvi–Suomela (ICALP’23): an adversary picks an arrival order; when a vertex arrives, the algorithm is allowed t synchronous LOCAL rounds on the subgraph induced by arrived nodes, and outputs for the new vertex become irrevocable. Crucially, over many arrivals, the total number of communication rounds can grow unbounded (t per arrival), allowing information to propagate arbitrarily far before a given vertex arrives.\\n\\nAudit of prover 02 (Online-LOCAL, t rounds per arrival)\\n- The proposed phase simulation uses a distance-(2t) coloring and executes t rounds per color. This guarantees that simultaneously processed vertices do not interfere within t hops. However, it silently compresses many per-arrival t-round windows (potentially Θ(n)) into a single t-round block per color. In the true Online-LOCAL run, before a vertex v arrives, there can be an arbitrary number of earlier arrivals, hence arbitrarily many global t-round windows; messages from arbitrarily far may have propagated into B(v,t) by the time v arrives. The phase simulation does not reproduce this accumulated state; after only one t-round block, the states of nodes in B(v,t) can differ from the states they would have in the genuine online execution under the chosen order. Therefore, the inductive invariant “transcripts are identical to the online run” is not justified under the general Online-LOCAL model.\\n- Minimal scenario illustrating the gap: Consider a path and t=1. In a genuine online run that processes nearly all nodes on the left before v, the leftmost node’s state can propagate one hop per arrival and reach neighbors of v just before v arrives. The proposed phase simulation gives the left side only O(1) total rounds before v’s phase, so the states seen by v may not match those in the online run. The argument needs an extra condition to rule out such long-range accumulation.\\n\\nAudit of prover 01 (sequential local/greedy model)\\n- The bridge “online ⇒ sequential local” (Lemma A) is correct if “online” is understood as: the decision at v depends only on the r-hop neighborhood and previously fixed outputs in that ball, and the algorithm must succeed for every order. Under that assumption, the classical color-phased simulation over a proper G^r coloring works. The proofs of Lemmas B and C are standard: color G^r in O(r log* n) rounds with O(Δ^{O(r)}) colors; then process colors in increasing order, using O(r) rounds per color to collect earlier outputs within distance r; with Δ bounded and r=O(1), total O(log* n).\\n- One caution: if the sequential rule is allowed to mutate “auxiliary state” on neighbors (not just set the current node’s output), then same-color phases would conflict unless r-balls are disjoint (need G^{2r} coloring). The safer and standard formulation is: the rule at v reads at distance ≤ r but only writes the output at v. I recommend using that formulation.\\n\\nConclusions and recommendations\\n- As written, the Prover 02 proof for the general Online-LOCAL (t rounds per arrival) has a fundamental gap. To salvage it, one must either (i) add an explicit assumption preventing unbounded long-range state accumulation (e.g., the transcript at v upon arrival is a function of the arrived subgraph inside distance ≤ t and the previously fixed outputs in that ball), or (ii) develop a nontrivial scheduling argument showing that for LCLs the long-range accumulation is irrelevant (or can be simulated) — this seems challenging and should be attempted carefully.\\n- The Prover 01 pipeline is sound under the “sequential local/greedy, r-local, order-robust” model. I recommend we formalize and archive this variant now (done in output.md), and, in parallel, either (A) try to prove a strengthening to the full Online-LOCAL model by introducing an additional notion of temporal locality, or (B) search for a counterexample LCL where Online-LOCAL with constant t outperforms LOCAL in the sense that the above reduction fails.\\n\\nConcrete next steps\\n- Precisely fix the model definition you aim to cover. If it is the sequential local/greedy model, we are essentially done; polish constants (use G^r coloring), and ensure the rule writes only at the current node. If it is Online-LOCAL(t), either:\\n  • Add an assumption: for each arrival of v, the t-round transcript relevant to v is a function of the arrived subgraph inside distance ≤ t and the outputs of those nodes (no dependence on mutable states outside the ball). Under this, the G^{2t} phase simulation becomes valid; or\\n  • Try to construct a rigorous schedule or padding argument that guarantees the local state within B(v,t) before v’s arrival is independent of far-away arrivals. If impossible, aim for a counterexample.\\n- Optionally, extend the archived theorem from trees to all bounded-degree graphs (the proof already applies verbatim).\",\"new_notes_md\":\"Context and goal\\nWe study the relationship between online-style constant-locality algorithms for LCLs on bounded-degree, unoriented trees and deterministic LOCAL-time upper bounds. Two notions of “online local” are relevant:\\n- Sequential local/greedy model (order-robust r-local): when processing a vertex v, the decision at v depends only on the r-hop neighborhood B(v,r) of the underlying graph and on already fixed outputs within B(v,r); the algorithm must succeed for every vertex order. No global mutable state or long-range message accumulation between steps.\\n- Online-LOCAL(t) (Akbari–Eslami–Lievonen–Melnyk–Särkijärvi–Suomela, ICALP’23): vertices arrive one by one; upon each arrival, the algorithm has t synchronous LOCAL rounds on the subgraph induced by arrived vertices; outputs are irrevocable. Over many arrivals, an unbounded number of communication rounds can occur, enabling long-range state accumulation.\\n\\nSafe, proven variant (archived below in output.md)\\n- Theorem (Sequential-local to LOCAL): If an LCL Π on bounded-degree graphs has a deterministic order-robust r-local sequential algorithm (decisions at v depend only on B(v,r) and outputs of earlier vertices in B(v,r), and the rule writes only the output at v), then Π has a deterministic LOCAL algorithm running in O(r log* n + Δ^{O(r)}) rounds. On bounded-degree trees with constant r, this is O(log* n). Proof: compute a proper coloring of G^r in O(r log* n) rounds with Δ^{O(r)} colors; process color classes in order, letting each v gather outputs from B(v,r) restricted to earlier colors and apply the sequential rule. Because nodes of the same color are at distance > r, their decisions do not depend on each other.\\n\\nGap for the full Online-LOCAL(t) model\\n- A direct phase simulation that uses a distance-(2t) coloring and t rounds per color does not generally reproduce the state a node v would see upon arrival in an actual online execution. In a true online run, before v arrives, there may have been Θ(n) earlier arrivals, yielding Θ(n)·t global rounds; information can propagate arbitrarily far and may alter the states within B(v,t). The phase simulation grants only O(1)·t total rounds before v’s phase, so the local states can differ. Hence, without additional constraints, we cannot claim that the phase simulation faithfully reproduces the online run or even yields correctness solely from A’s correctness.\\n\\nWays forward for Online-LOCAL(t)\\n- Add a locality-of-dependence assumption: the t-round transcript that determines v’s output depends only on the arrived subgraph inside distance ≤ t from v and on the outputs of those nodes, not on mutable states imported from farther away. Under this, distance-(2t) coloring plus phase simulation is valid and yields O(log* n).\\n- Alternatively, seek a structural scheduling/padding argument ensuring that for LCLs on bounded-degree trees, the state within B(v,t) before v’s arrival is independent of far-away arrivals. This is nontrivial; try first on paths/trees with t=1 to see whether accumulation can matter for any LCL.\\n- Or try to separate the models: construct an LCL that is solvable in constant t in Online-LOCAL but provably not simulable by the above constant-phase compression; if such an LCL exists, the general reduction fails, and the sequential-local variant becomes the correct target.\\n\\nRemarks\\n- No global edge orientation is needed anywhere in the reduction we proved; IDs suffice for coloring.\\n- The archived proof applies to all bounded-degree graphs; we stated trees to match the project focus.\\n\",\"new_notes_append\":\"True\",\"new_outputs_md\":\"List of proven results archived here\\n- Theorem A (Sequential-local to LOCAL on bounded-degree graphs).\\n- Lemma 1 (Power-graph coloring in O(k log* n)).\\n- Lemma 2 (Color-phased simulation for order-robust r-local rules).\\n- Corollary A (Bounded-degree trees, constant r ⇒ O(log* n)).\\n\\nModel and definitions\\n- Graphs: finite, simple, maximum degree Δ < ∞ (bounded degree).

The final labeling satisfies Π for every order. (A does not write to any vertex other than the current v_i.)\\n\\nLemma 1 (Power-graph coloring in O(k log* n))\\nStatement. Let G be a bounded-degree graph and k ≥ 1 a constant. There is a deterministic LOCAL algorithm that computes a proper vertex coloring of the power graph G^k with at most C = O(Δ(G^k)^2) colors in O(k log* n) rounds on G. In particular, Δ(G^k) ≤ Δ^k, so C = Δ^{O(k)}.\\nProof. It is known that in the LOCAL model one can compute a proper O(Δ(H)^2)-coloring of any graph H in O(log* n) rounds (Linial’s color-reduction). To color G^k while communicating on G, we simulate each round of the O(log* n)-round coloring algorithm on G^k by k rounds on G: in k rounds, every node can learn the IDs and temporary colors of all nodes at distance ≤ k in G, i.e., its neighbors in G^k. Thus, O(log* n) rounds on G^k translate to O(k log* n) rounds on G. The color bound follows from Δ(G^k) ≤ Δ^k. □\\n\\nLemma 2 (Color-phased simulation for order-robust r-local rules)\\nStatement. Let A be an order-robust r-local sequential algorithm for Π. Let φ:V→{1,…,C} be a proper coloring of G^r (i.e., nodes at distance ≤ r have distinct colors). Then there is a deterministic LOCAL simulation that processes colors 1,2,…,C and assigns the same outputs as A would when run on any order that first lists all nodes of color 1 (in any internal order), then color 2, and so on. The simulation uses O(r) rounds per color after φ is known.\\nProof. Fix A and φ. Since φ is a proper coloring of G^r, if φ(u)=φ(v) then dist(u,v)>r, so B(u,r) and B(v,r) are disjoint from {v} and {u}, respectively; in particular, the decision at u under A can depend only on outputs of vertices strictly within B(u,r) and, hence, on colors < φ(u) if we process colors in increasing order. The simulation proceeds for i=1,…,C: in phase i, each vertex v with φ(v)=i performs the following in parallel: gather the outputs of vertices in B(v,r) with colors < i (this takes r rounds of communication, as outputs are already fixed for colors < i), then apply A’s local rule to determine v’s output. Because the rule reads only B(v,r) and writes only at v, and B(u,r) contains no vertex of color i other than u, all decisions in phase i are independent and match A’s decisions under any vertex order that respects the color layering. □\\n\\nTheorem A (Sequential-local to LOCAL on bounded-degree graphs)\\nStatement. Let Π be an LCL on bounded-degree graphs. Suppose Π admits a deterministic order-robust r-local sequential algorithm A (as defined above). Then Π has a deterministic LOCAL algorithm running in O(r log* n + C·r) rounds, where C = Δ^{O(r)} depends only on Δ and r. In particular, for constant Δ and constant r, the round complexity is O(log* n).\\nProof. Use Lemma 1 with k=r to compute a proper coloring φ of G^r in O(r log* n) rounds with C=Δ^{O(r)} colors. Then use Lemma 2 to simulate A by processing colors 1,…,C, spending O(r) rounds per color to collect outputs from earlier colors within distance r and decide the current color’s outputs. The total is O(r log* n + C·r). Correctness follows from Lemma 2. □\\n\\nCorollary A (Bounded-degree trees, constant locality)\\nStatement. On bounded-degree, unoriented trees, if Π has a deterministic order-robust r-local sequential algorithm for some constant r, then Π has a deterministic LOCAL algorithm with round complexity O(log* n).\\nProof. Trees are bounded-degree graphs; apply Theorem A. No edge orientation is used. □\\n\\nRemark (about Online-LOCAL(t)). The results above do not cover the full Online-LOCAL(t) model in which each arrival grants t synchronous rounds and nodes may accumulate mutable state across arrivals. In that model, before a vertex arrives, arbitrarily many global t-round windows may have elapsed, potentially allowing long-range information to influence its local neighborhood. The phase-simulation argument requires an extra assumption restricting such long-range dependence (e.g., that a vertex’s output upon arrival depends only on the arrived subgraph within distance ≤ t and previously fixed outputs therein). Proving a general reduction under the unrestricted Online-LOCAL(t) model remains open here.\\n\",\"new_outputs_append\":\"True\",\"verdict\":\"uncertain\"}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"auto","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"VerifierNewSchema","schema_":{"properties":{"feedback_md":{"title":"Feedback Md","type":"string"},"new_notes_md":{"title":"New Notes Md","type":"string"},"new_notes_append":{"title":"New Notes Append","type":"string"},"new_outputs_md":{"title":"New Outputs Md","type":"string"},"new_outputs_append":{"title":"New Outputs Append","type":"string"},"verdict":{"title":"Verdict","type":"string"}},"required":["feedback_md","new_notes_md","new_notes_append","new_outputs_md","new_outputs_append","verdict"],"title":"VerifierNewSchema","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":5342,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":21915,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":18496},"total_tokens":27257},"user":null,"store":true}
