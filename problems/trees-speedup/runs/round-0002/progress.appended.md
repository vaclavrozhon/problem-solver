- **Mini-plan**:
  1. Extract and state Theorem 1.5 from the paper and its implications for trees.
     - *How it can fail*: Misinterpretation of the theorem's conditions.
     - *Test attempt*: Check if the theorem holds for a simple tree (e.g., a star).
  2. Identify key properties of bounded-degree trees that could influence the generalization.
     - *How it can fail*: Overlooking edge cases in tree structures.
     - *Test attempt*: Analyze a binary tree with varying degrees.
  3. Explore existing results for LCL problems in the context of trees.
     - *How it can fail*: Results may not directly apply to nonoriented trees.
     - *Test attempt*: Compare results for oriented vs nonoriented trees.
  4. Develop a strategy for proving the generalized speedup theorem.
     - *How it can fail*: The strategy may not cover all necessary cases.
     - *Test attempt*: Attempt a proof sketch for a specific LCL problem.
  5. Consider potential counterexamples to the generalized theorem.
     - *How it can fail*: Counterexamples may not be valid or relevant.
     - *Test attempt*: Construct a tree where the theorem does not hold.
  6. Review literature for additional lemmas or heuristics that could aid in the proof.
     - *How it can fail*: Missing crucial references or insights.
     - *Test attempt*: Cross-reference with recent surveys on local algorithms.
