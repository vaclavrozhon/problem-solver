The archived Theorem A already proves the O(log* n) speedup from an order-robust r-local sequential algorithm that only writes the output at the current vertex. To reach the stated Online-LOCAL(t) goal, we propose the following incremental plan.\\n  1) Define a t-local-dependence property for deterministic Online-LOCAL(t): when vertex v arrives, its output depends only on the induced arrived subgraph inside B(v,t) and the already fixed outputs in that ball (no dependence on mutable state originating outside B(v,t)).\\n  2) Lemma (Online-LOCAL(t) with t-local-dependence ⇒ sequential r-local): Under this property, fixing any arrival order produces a local decision rule of radius r=t that is order-robust and writes only at the current vertex. This drops directly into Theorem A, giving O(log* n) in LOCAL.\\n  3) Conversion attempt on trees: For LCLs on bounded-degree trees, try to transform any constant-t Online-LOCAL algorithm into one satisfying t-local-dependence with the same t (or t′=O(t)). Intuition: on trees, arrivals at distance >2t commute (their effects on B(v,t) do not interact), and an adversarial order certification plus a confluence-style argument should let us “erase” far-away influences without affecting correctness.\\n\\nExamples and sanity checks\\n- Toy counterexample to naive phase compression (why we need the extra property). Consider a path and t=1. In a genuine online run that processes almost all nodes on the left before v, one-hop state can per-arrival propagate across the path and reach the neighbors of v before v arrives. A color-phased simulation that grants only O(1) rounds before v’s phase cannot reproduce these accumulated states. Hence the earlier invariant “simulate an identical transcript” fails in the unrestricted online model.\\n- Benign class where the reduction works: problems for which nodes never maintain auxiliary state, and per-arrival message contents are functions of already fixed outputs within distance ≤t (e.g., greedy MIS/Maximal Matching in their purely local sequential guise). These satisfy t-local-dependence and are covered by Theorem A via the proposed Lemma.\\n\\nObstacles\\n- Unrestricted Online-LOCAL(t) admits unbounded many t-round windows before a vertex arrives; local states in B(v,t) may depend on far-away arrivals via long chains of arrived vertices. Without t-local-dependence, a color-phased simulation cannot in general reconstruct the per-arrival transcript or even guarantee correctness.\\n- Confluence on trees is nontrivial: While arrivals at distance >2t commute, establishing a global Church–Rosser–type property that yields a canonical local state in B(v,t) independent of far-away order requires careful formalization of the per-arrival t-round “rewrite steps”.\\n\\nProposed lemmas (clean, checkable)\\n- Definition (t-local-dependence). A deterministic Online-LOCAL(t) algorithm A has t-local-dependence if, when vertex v arrives, its output is a function of the arrived subgraph induced in B(v,t) and of the already fixed outputs within B(v,t); in particular, it does not depend on any additional mutable states in B(v,t) that could have been imported from beyond B(v,t).\\n- Lemma 1 (Bridge under t-local-dependence). If Π has a deterministic Online-LOCAL(t) algorithm with t-local-dependence, then Π has a deterministic order-robust t-local sequential algorithm that writes only at the current vertex. Why useful: plugs directly into Theorem A to get O(log* n) LOCAL on bounded-degree graphs.\\n  Sketch: Fix any adversarial order. At v, read G[B(v,t)] and the outputs already fixed within B(v,t). By t-local-dependence, this determines exactly the output that A would produce when v arrives under that order; writing only at v yields an order-robust sequential rule.\\n- Lemma 2 (Power-graph coloring as in output.md). Already archived; we will use k=r=t.\\n- Lemma 3 (Color-phased simulation of order-robust rules). Already archived; note the “writes only at v” hypothesis. If a rule may write to neighbors, replace G^r-coloring by G^{2r}-coloring; the asymptotics on bounded-degree graphs remain O(log* n).\\n\\nNext steps (auditable)\\n- Formalize Lemma 1 and add to output.md the “writes only at v” caveat explicitly (or the G^{2r} variant). Provide a crisp proof.\\n- Attempt a tree-specific conversion from arbitrary Online-LOCAL(t) to t-local-dependence. Plan: model each arrival as a local rewrite acting on radius-t views; prove commutativity for arrivals at distance >2t; use acyclicity of trees to show that the local state in B(v,t) at the time v arrives has a canonical form depending only on outputs in B(v,t). If successful, this removes the extra assumption on trees.\\n- In parallel, explore lower bounds: adapt round-elimination or known hard LCLs on trees (e.g., sinkless orientation) to Online-LOCAL, aiming to show they require Ω(log n) even there. This would indirectly support the classification-based route: constant-time Online-LOCAL cannot handle the log n-class, hence any LCL solvable in O(1) Online-LOCAL sits in the O(1)/Θ(log* n) bucket.\\n- Construct toy counterexamples to test necessity/tightness of t-local-dependence: try to design an LCL and an Online-LOCAL(1) algorithm whose output at v provably depends on imported far-away state within B(v,1). If such an LCL exists, then the general reduction needs genuinely new ideas (or must fail for that problem).\\n\\nNotes on gaps or edits for output.md\\n- Lemma 2 currently assumes the sequential rule “reads within distance r and writes only at the current node”; mention this hypothesis explicitly. If one wishes to allow writing to neighbors within distance r, modify the coloring to G^{2r} to ensure independence of same-color phases.\\n- The remark about Online-LOCAL(t) correctly flags the key gap: unlimited accumulation of state prior to an arrival. We will add Definition/Lemma (t-local-dependence and bridge) if the verifier agrees; this would document a precise condition under which the claimed speedup is valid for online algorithms as well.\\n\\nWhy this is progress\\n- We identified the precise barrier preventing a direct reduction from Online-LOCAL(t) to LOCAL and proposed a concrete, checkable locality-of-dependence condition that suffices to bridge the models.\\n- We outlined a tree-specific confluence program that, if proven, removes the extra assumption and would settle the original task.\\n- We gave a tight modification to the archived Lemma 2 concerning writing side effects and the need for G^{2r}-coloring, which the verifier can incorporate immediately.\\n\"}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"auto","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"ProverOutput","schema_":{"properties":{"progress_md":{"description":"Append-only progress notes","title":"Progress Md","type":"string"}},"required":["progress_md"],"title":"ProverOutput","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":71626,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":7975,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":6464},"total_tokens":79601},"user":null,"store":true}
