  "summary_md": "This round clarified a precise gap between the archived O(log* n) speedup (Theorem A, Lemma 1\u20132, Corollary A) \u2014 which is correct for the order-robust r-local sequential model that reads B(v,r) and writes only at v \u2014 and the stronger \u201cOnline-LOCAL(t)\u201d model used in ICALP\u201923. Two useful restricted variants were proposed and connected to the archived proof: (i) output-only Online-LOCAL(t) (arrived vertices fix immutable outputs and send messages that depend only on graph + those outputs in B(v,t)), and (ii) t-local-dependence (v\u2019s decision depends only on arrived subgraph and fixed outputs in B(v,t)). Lemma O1 / Bridge lemmas show these restrictions imply an order-robust sequential r-local rule (r=t), hence the archived O(log* n) result applies. A minimal counter-scenario on a path (t=1) demonstrates why unrestricted Online-LOCAL(t) can accumulate long-range mutable state that breaks the color-phased simulation. The main open technical direction is a tree-specific \u201cstate-elimination\u201d program (start with paths t=1, prove a canonical interface on \u2202B(v,2t) or exhibit a separating LCL).

  "highlights": [
    "Theorem A (archived) correctly gives O(log* n) LOCAL for order-robust r-local sequential algorithms that read B(v,r) and write only at v.",
    "There are two different \"online\" models: (1) order-robust r-local sequential (handled already), and (2) the Online-LOCAL(t) of Akbari et al. (ICALP\u201923); the latter allows accumulated long-range state across many arrivals.",
    "Definition and lemma: output-only Online-LOCAL(t) (and equivalently t-local-dependence) were introduced; Lemma O1/Bridge shows such an online algorithm yields an order-robust r-local sequential rule with r=t, so Theorem A applies.",
    "Concrete counter-scenario on a path (t=1): repeated arrivals can propagate information one hop per arrival and imprint far-away state into B(v,1) before v arrives \u2014 a color-phased simulation that only grants O(1) rounds cannot reproduce this.",
    "State-elimination target: conjecture that on bounded-degree trees (start with paths) any deterministic Online-LOCAL(t) can be transformed into an output-only/t-local-dependence form by showing that the interface \u2202B(v,2t) admits a canonical, finite summary depending only on final outputs in B(v,2t).",
    "Alternative contingency: if state-elimination fails, attempt to build an LCL on trees that separates Online-LOCAL(t) from order-robust sequential rules (or show impossibility guided by Theorem 2.33)."
