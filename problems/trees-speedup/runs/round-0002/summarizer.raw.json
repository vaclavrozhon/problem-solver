Two useful restricted variants were proposed and connected to the archived proof: (i) output-only Online-LOCAL(t) (arrived vertices fix immutable outputs and send messages that depend only on graph + those outputs in B(v,t)), and (ii) t-local-dependence (v’s decision depends only on arrived subgraph and fixed outputs in B(v,t)). Lemma O1 / Bridge lemmas show these restrictions imply an order-robust sequential r-local rule (r=t), hence the archived O(log* n) result applies. A minimal counter-scenario on a path (t=1) demonstrates why unrestricted Online-LOCAL(t) can accumulate long-range mutable state that breaks the color-phased simulation. The main open technical direction is a tree-specific “state-elimination” program (start with paths t=1, prove a canonical interface on ∂B(v,2t) or exhibit a separating LCL).
