• The approach to generalizing Theorem 1.5 is promising.
• Caution is needed in interpreting Theorem 1.5 to avoid misapplication.
• Key properties of bounded-degree trees must be thoroughly analyzed.
• Existing results for LCL problems should be clearly linked to nonoriented trees.
• The proof strategy needs to be comprehensive and cover all cases.
• Counterexamples must be relevant and effectively demonstrate limitations.
