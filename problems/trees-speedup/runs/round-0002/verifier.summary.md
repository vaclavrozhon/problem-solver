High-level assessment and key corrections
- The archived pipeline (Lemma 1, Lemma 2, Theorem A, Corollary A) is sound and well-stated for the order-robust r-local sequential model with the crucial “writes only at the current vertex” restriction. This is the correct safe baseline.
- Both reports correctly identify the central barrier for the full Online-LOCAL(t) model: unbounded accumulation of mutable state across arbitrarily many t-round windows before a node v arrives can alter the local state in B(v,t) in ways the phase simulation does not reproduce.
- Important correction: Prover 01’s Lemma O1, as stated, claims r = t for the “output-only” online variant. This is not generally true under the given formulation. At v’s arrival, nodes u at distance ≤ t from v can send messages to v in t rounds, and each such u may compute those messages as a function of outputs within B(u,t). Hence v’s decision can depend on outputs up to distance 2t from v. The correct bridge is output-only Online-LO
