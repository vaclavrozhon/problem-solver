  "feedback_md": "The prover's latest round outlines a structured approach to generalizing Theorem 1.5 to nonoriented trees, which is a promising direction. However, there are several areas that require more rigor and clarity. Firstly, the extraction and interpretation of Theorem 1.5 should be done with caution, as misinterpretation could lead to incorrect conclusions about its applicability to trees. The prover should ensure that the theorem's conditions are fully understood and correctly applied. Secondly, while identifying key properties of bounded-degree trees, it is essential to consider specific examples and edge cases to avoid overlooking critical aspects that could invalidate the generalization. The exploration of existing results for LCL problems is crucial, but the prover must clearly delineate how these results apply to nonoriented trees, as assumptions may not hold. The strategy for proving the generalized theorem needs to be comprehensive, covering all necessary cases, and the prover should be prepared to refine this strategy based on feedback from initial proof sketches. Lastly, while considering counterexamples, the prover should ensure that these examples are relevant and effectively demonstrate the limitations of the theorem. Overall, the plan is solid, but it requires careful execution and validation at each step.",
