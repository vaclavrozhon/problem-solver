This is the correct safe baseline.\n- Both reports correctly identify the central barrier for the full Online-LOCAL(t) model: unbounded accumulation of mutable state across arbitrarily many t-round windows before a node v arrives can alter the local state in B(v,t) in ways the phase simulation does not reproduce.\n- Important correction: Prover 01’s Lemma O1, as stated, claims r = t for the “output-only” online variant. This is not generally true under the given formulation. At v’s arrival, nodes u at distance ≤ t from v can send messages to v in t rounds, and each such u may compute those messages as a function of outputs within B(u,t). Hence v’s decision can depend on outputs up to distance 2t from v. The correct bridge is output-only Online-LOCAL(t) ⇒ order-robust sequential with radius r = 2t (not t). Prover 02’s “t-local-dependence” condition is the right strengthening to obtain radius r=t.\n- The toy counterexample on a path (t=1) that demonstrates the failure of naive phase compression in the unrestricted online model is valid and should remain in notes to highlight the gap.\n\nWhat we can rigorously add now\n- A precise definition of Online-LOCAL(t) and the output-only restriction.\n- A bridging lemma: output-only Online-LOCAL(t) ⇒ order-robust sequential rule with radius r=2t (writes only at v), hence O(log* n) on bounded-degree trees via Theorem A.\n- A stronger bridge under Prover 02’s t-local-dependence property: Online-LOCAL(t)+t-local-dependence ⇒ order-robust sequential rule with radius r=t.\n- Optional but helpful: a generalized color-phased simulation lemma for rules that may write within distance W>0: a proper coloring of G^{R+W} suffices to ensure independence when reads are within radius R and writes within radius W.\n\nValue triage\n- Solid: the clarifications of models, the counter-scenario on paths, and the t-local-dependence bridge.

A node u ∈ B(v,t) may compute its messages based on outputs within B(u,t), which is contained in B(v,2t). Thus, in the output-only model, v’s output depends only on the graph structure and outputs within B(v,2t). Consequently, the correct bridge is to a sequential rule of radius 2t (not t). If we assume t-local-dependence at v, the bridge tightens to radius t.\n\n- Minimal counter-scenario (why naive phase-compression fails for the unrestricted online model):\n  Consider a path with t=1. In a genuine online run, before a vertex v arrives, Θ(n) earlier arrivals can propagate state one hop per window across the path; by the time v arrives, its neighbors may carry information injected far away. A color-phased simulation that offers only O(1) windows before v’s phase cannot reproduce these accumulated states. This shows that without output-only or t-local-dependence, we cannot black-box simulate arbitrary Online-LOCAL(t) runs by a constant number of phases.\n\n- Practical takeaway for reductions:\n  • If your online algorithm is output-only, design the sequential rule to read B(v,2t) and write only at v; then apply the G^{2t} coloring pipeline to get O(log* n) on bounded-degree trees.\n  • If your online algorithm satisfies t-local-dependence at v, the sequential rule needs only B(v,t).\n\n- Next-step plan (state elimination on trees):\n  • Start on paths with t=1. Define the interface ∂B(v,2) and annulus R=B(v,2)\\B(v,1). Attempt to prove: if two online executions agree on outputs over B(v,2), then they allow exactly the same outputs at v. If proven, extend to trees and t by replacing 2 with 2t. If refuted, crystallize a separation example.\n  • Track read/write radii for any sequential rules that go beyond “write only at v”; use distance-(R+W) colorings for phase independence.\n","new_notes_append":"True","new_outputs_md":"New definitions (for bridging lemmas)\n- Online-LOCAL(t). An arrival sequence v_1,…,v_n is fixed. At step i, the subgraph G_i induced by {v_1,…,v_i} becomes available. The algorithm performs t synchronous LOCAL rounds on G_i (messages along edges of G_i, arbitrary local computation). The output label of v_i must be irrevocably fixed by the end of these t rounds. Previously arrived nodes’ outputs are irrevocable. In the general model, nodes may maintain arbitrary local state across steps.\n- Output-only Online-LOCAL(t). Same as above, except that the only state that persists across arrival steps is the immutable output label of each node. In any t-round window, all messages and local computations at a node x may depend on the underlying graph and the currently known outputs within distance ≤ t from x, but not on any other mutable state from prior steps.\n- t-local-dependence (at v). An Online-LOCAL(t) algorithm has t-local-dependence if, when v arrives, the output chosen for v is a function only of the induced arrived subgraph on B(v,t) and of the outputs of the arrived nodes in B(v,t); in particular, it does not depend on any additional mutable state or on outputs outside B(v,t).\n\nLemma B (Output-only Online-LOCAL(t) ⇒ order-robust sequential with radius 2t)\nStatement. Let Π be an LCL on bounded-degree graphs. Suppose there is a deterministic output-only Online-LOCAL(t) algorithm that is correct for every arrival order. Then Π admits a deterministic order-robust sequential algorithm that, when processing v, reads only B(v,2t) and the outputs already fixed within B(v,2t), writes only at v, and produces a correct global labeling for every vertex order.\nProof. Fix any vertex order σ = (v_1,…,v_n). Define the sequential rule S as follows. When processing v_i, collect the subgraph induced by B(v_i,2t) and the set of outputs already fixed among vertices in B(v_i,2t) ∩ {v_1,…,v_{i-1}}. Consider the online execution whose arrival order equals σ. In the output-only model, at the time v_i arrives, during its t-round window, only nodes within distance ≤ t from v_i can send messages that reach v_i. Each such node u ∈ B(v_i,t) computes its messages as a function of outputs in B(u,t) (by output-only), and B(u,t) ⊆ B(v_i,2t). Hence the entire t-round transcript observed by v_i, and thus v_i’s output, is a function of the restriction of the arrived subgraph and outputs to B(v_i,2t). The restriction seen by S (earlier outputs in B(v_i,2t) under order σ) coincides with the restriction seen by the online algorithm at the moment v_i arrives in the σ-arrival run. Therefore S produces exactly the same output for v_i as the online algorithm in that run. Determinism and the online algorithm’s correctness for every arrival order imply that, for every σ, the sequential execution under S yields a labeling satisfying Π. S reads only B(v_i,2t) and writes only at v_i, so S is an order-robust 2t-local sequential algorithm. □\n\nLemma C (Bridge under t-local-dependence: radius t)\nStatement. Let Π be an LCL on bounded-degree graphs. Suppose there is a deterministic Online-LOCAL(t) algorithm with t-local-dependence (at every v) that is correct for every arrival order. Then Π admits a deterministic order-robust sequential algorithm that, when processing v, reads only B(v,t) and the outputs already fixed within B(v,t), writes only at v, and is correct for every vertex order.\nProof. Fix any vertex order σ and define the sequential rule S analogously to Lemma B but with radius t. By t-local-dependence, in the σ-arrival online execution the output of v_i depends only on the arrived subgraph restricted to B(v_i,t) and the outputs of arrived nodes in B(v_i,t). This restriction matches exactly the information available to S at v_i under σ. Hence S reproduces the online output at v_i for the σ-arrival run. Correctness and locality properties follow as in Lemma B. □\n\nCorollary B (Bounded-degree trees, constant t ⇒ O(log* n) LOCAL)\nStatement. On bounded-degree trees, if Π has a deterministic output-only Online-LOCAL(t) algorithm for constant t, then Π has a deterministic LOCAL algorithm with round complexity O(log* n). The same holds if Π has a deterministic Online-LOCAL(t) algorithm with t-local-dependence.\nProof. Combine Lemma B (resp. Lemma C) with Theorem A. On trees with constant Δ and constant t, r ∈ {2t,t} is constant; Theorem A yields O(log* n). □\n\nVariant of Lemma 2 (allowing bounded-distance writes)\nStatement. Let A be an order-robust sequential rule that, when processing v, reads only B(v,R) and may write outputs on vertices within distance ≤ W of v (for some fixed constants R,W≥0). Let φ be a proper coloring of G^{R+W}. Then processing colors 1,…,C according to φ simulates any vertex order that respects the color layering: decisions in each color class are independent and match A for any such order.\nProof. If dist(u,v) > R+W and φ(u)=φ(v), then (i) the read ball B(u,R) is disjoint from the write neighborhood of v and vice versa, and (ii) B(u,R)∩B(v,R)=∅. Thus, within a single color phase, the read/write effects of different vertices cannot interfere, and each vertex’s decision under A depends only on outputs fixed in earlier color phases within its read radius. The standard argument of Lemma 2 then applies. Computing φ takes O((R+W) log* n) rounds by Lemma 1 with k=R+W. □\n\nRemark (scope relative to unrestricted Online-LOCAL(t)). The lemmas above cover two restricted variants: output-only (radius 2t) and t-local-dependence (radius t). For the full Online-LOCAL(t) model with arbitrary persistent mutable state, reducing to order-robust sequential rules remains open here; the known obstruction is that long chains of arrivals can accumulate state in B(v,t) before v arrives, which a constant number of phases cannot reproduce. The path/t=1 counter-scenario illustrates this limitation.","new_outputs_append":"True","verdict":"success"}
