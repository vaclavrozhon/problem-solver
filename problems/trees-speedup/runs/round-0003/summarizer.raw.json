This localises any information that can affect v during its t-window to the finite ball B(v,2t), matching the 2t read-radius in the earlier bridge. The round proposes an “interface-confluence” program for t=1 on paths: define per-neighbor interface types τ(u→v) depending only on outputs in B(u,2), then show the tuple of these types plus existing outputs in B(v,2) determines v’s transcript and output; extend by branch decomposition to trees and by scaling radii for general t. The main remaining obstacle is internal non-confluence inside B(u,2): Lemma D removes long-range effects but does not force order-robustness of local histories. Next actions are to formalise Lemma D/Corollary D.1 in output.md, carry out the path t=1 interface analysis (prove or find a counterexample), and then generalise or document the limitation.
