  "progress_md": "Status check and scope\n- The curated output.md now includes the corrected bounded-writes simulation (color G^K with K = max(2W, R+W)), the output-only bridges (W=0 and W>0), and the 2t-commutativity/cutoff lemma. This fixes the earlier flaw flagged by the verifier (using G^{R+W} was insufficient) and provides a complete O(log* n) pipeline for the output-only (and t-local-dependence) online models on bounded-degree trees.\n- The main open gap remains the unrestricted Online-LOCAL(t) model: unlimited mutable state can accumulate across many arrivals before v, and our color-phased simulation need not reproduce these states. The commutativity lemma localizes influence to B(v,2t), but internal nonconfluence within B(v,2t) is unresolved.\n\nNew micro-lemmas (formal and checkable)\n- Lemma 8 (Strong witness-localization at v). Let A be a deterministic Online-LOCAL(t) algorithm and \u03c3 any arrival sequence. For any vertex v, there exists a sequence \u03c3_v obtained from \u03c3 by swapping adjacent arrivals at distance > 2t such that (i) all arrivals before v in \u03c3_v occur at vertices in B(v,2t), (ii) the arrived subgraph just before v arrives is G[B(v,2t)]\u2229{arrived}, and (iii) the local states and fixed outputs on B(v,t) at the time v arrives are identical in \u03c3 and \u03c3_v.\n  Proof idea: Iteratively apply Lemma 7 to push every arrival at distance > 2t from v past v. Each swap preserves the state within B(v,t) at the time v arrives; hence (iii) holds. Statements (i)\u2013(ii) then follow by construction.\n- Lemma 9 (Finite local enumeration for t=1 on paths). On a path, for any vertex v, the set of arrival orders restricted to B(v,2) is finite with size bounded by a constant c(\u0394) independent of n; hence the set of possible transcripts/messages seen by v under any normalized \u03c3_v is finite. This is an accounting lemma (use \u0394 \u2264 2 on paths) and will be useful if a local confluence/summary argument can be established.\n\nPath, t=1 interface program \u2014 sharpening targets\n- Definitions (interface types). For a path and t=1, define K(v) to be the restriction of already-fixed outputs just before v arrives to B(v,2). For each neighbor u \u2208 N(v), define the interface type \u03c4(u\u2192v) as the set of all outgoing 1-round messages that u can send to v at the start of v\u2019s window, ranging over all normalized arrival orders \u03c3_v consistent with K(v). Note that \u03c4(u\u2192v) depends a priori on the internal states at u caused by earlier arrivals within B(v,2), not just on outputs.\n- Target Claim C1 (context-invariance). For any deterministic Online-LOCAL(1) algorithm A that is correct for all orders on paths, \u03c4(u\u2192v) is a function only of K(v). If C1 holds, then the pair of types (\u03c4(left\u2192v), \u03c4(right\u2192v)) together with K(v) determines v\u2019s 1-round transcript and thus v\u2019s output; consequently, v\u2019s output can be written as f(K(v)), yielding a sequential rule with read radius R=2 (W depending on A).\n- Why plausible: Lemma 8 restricts all relevant pre-v activity to B(v,2). Correctness-for-all-orders constrains the variability of \u03c4(u\u2192v): in particular, if two normalized local histories share K(v), any divergence in \u03c4 would imply two global normalized executions that share K(v) but force different decisions at v under the same neighbor messages\u2014this is the crux to be formalized.\n\nObstacles and what fails without extra structure\n- Messages are unbounded in LOCAL, hence in principle \u03c4(u\u2192v) could be infinite and depend on arbitrary pre-window states, even if K(v) is fixed. Without additional constraints, direct finiteness/regularity arguments (e.g., Myhill\u2013Nerode\u2013style) are unavailable.\n- Local confluence inside B(v,2) is not implied by 2t-commutativity (which only handles dist > 2t). For t=1, arrivals at distance 2 can causally affect a neighbor\u2019s 1-round message to v, and these steps need not commute.\n\nWhy the current bridges suffice in natural cases\n- The output-only model (and its W-write variant) sidesteps the obstacles: each neighbor\u2019s outgoing message during v\u2019s window is a function of outputs within distance 1 of the sender; by Lemma 6, v\u2019s decision depends only on outputs in B(v,2) (or B(v,2+W) for bounded writes), and the color-phased simulation gives O(log* n).\n- The t-local-dependence variant provides an even tighter radius (R=t) and is common for greedy \u201cdecide-at-current-node\u201d online rules.\n\nActionable next steps (auditable)\n1) Formalize C1 or refute it on paths:\n   - Set up the precise semantics of \u03c4(u\u2192v): enumerate all normalized permutations of arrivals in B(v,2), run A on each (local simulation of a finite tree of executions), and collect the set of possible messages. Prove (or disprove by counterexample) that \u03c4(u\u2192v) depends only on K(v).\n   - If C1 holds, define f(K(v)) by simulating v\u2019s 1-window using any representative execution consistent with K(v); argue that f yields a well-defined (R=2, W as needed) sequential rule S. Then invoke Lemma 5 to obtain O(log* n) in LOCAL on bounded-degree trees.\n2) If C1 fails, attempt a weaker canonicalization:\n   - Show existence of a canonical choice g(K(v)) \u2208 \u03c4(u\u2192v) for each interface that still yields a valid global labeling when composed across vertices via color-phased scheduling (this would be a \u201clocal mending\u201d style selection).\n3) Extend Lemma 8 to quantify the precise bound on the number of arrival steps that can affect v: for general t and degree \u0394, |B(v,2t)| \u2264 \u0394^{O(t)}; record this bound for use in exhaustive local simulations.\n4) Strengthen output.md with an explicit remark that the main theorem presently holds under output-only (and t-local-dependence) hypotheses and that unrestricted Online-LOCAL(t) is open; add Lemma 8 and Lemma 9 as formal tools for the path-interface program.\n\nNotes on output.md (gaps/edits)\n- The listed lemmas are correct as stated. To support the path-interface program, we suggest adding:\n  \u2022 Lemma 8 (strong witness-localization at v) with proof.\n  \u2022 A short bound on |B(v,2t)| and the induced finite enumeration of normalized local orders (Lemma 9).\n- Clarify in Corollary B that the overall runtime is O((2t+2W)\u00b7log* n + O(1)) and dominated by the coloring step for constant \u0394, t, W.\n\nWhy this round is progress\n- We strengthened the normalization toolkit (Lemma 8), formalized the interface-type notion for the path/t=1 case, and articulated a precise, falsifiable claim (C1) whose resolution would close the remaining gap. We also scoped a concrete finite-enumeration approach to test C1 and outlined fallback strategies if it fails. These are incremental, auditable steps towards eliminating mutable-state dependence inside B(v,2t) on trees."
