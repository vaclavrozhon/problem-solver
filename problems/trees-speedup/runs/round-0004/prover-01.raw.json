This fixes the earlier flaw flagged by the verifier (using G^{R+W} was insufficient) and provides a complete O(log* n) pipeline for the output-only (and t-local-dependence) online models on bounded-degree trees.\\n- The main open gap remains the unrestricted Online-LOCAL(t) model: unlimited mutable state can accumulate across many arrivals before v, and our color-phased simulation need not reproduce these states. The commutativity lemma localizes influence to B(v,2t), but internal nonconfluence within B(v,2t) is unresolved.\\n\\nNew micro-lemmas (formal and checkable)\\n- Lemma 8 (Strong witness-localization at v). Let A be a deterministic Online-LOCAL(t) algorithm and σ any arrival sequence. For any vertex v, there exists a sequence σ_v obtained from σ by swapping adjacent arrivals at distance > 2t such that (i) all arrivals before v in σ_v occur at vertices in B(v,2t), (ii) the arrived subgraph just before v arrives is G[B(v,2t)]∩{arrived}, and (iii) the local states and fixed outputs on B(v,t) at the time v arrives are identical in σ and σ_v.\\n  Proof idea: Iteratively apply Lemma 7 to push every arrival at distance > 2t from v past v. Each swap preserves the state within B(v,t) at the time v arrives; hence (iii) holds. Statements (i)–(ii) then follow by construction.\\n- Lemma 9 (Finite local enumeration for t=1 on paths). On a path, for any vertex v, the set of arrival orders restricted to B(v,2) is finite with size bounded by a constant c(Δ) independent of n; hence the set of possible transcripts/messages seen by v under any normalized σ_v is finite. This is an accounting lemma (use Δ ≤ 2 on paths) and will be useful if a local confluence/summary argument can be established.\\n\\nPath, t=1 interface program — sharpening targets\\n- Definitions (interface types). For a path and t=1, define K(v) to be the restriction of already-fixed outputs just before v arrives to B(v,2). For each neighbor u ∈ N(v), define the interface type τ(u→v) as the set of all outgoing 1-round messages that u can send to v at the start of v’s window, ranging over all normalized arrival orders σ_v consistent with K(v). Note that τ(u→v) depends a priori on the internal states at u caused by earlier arrivals within B(v,2), not just on outputs.\\n- Target Claim C1 (context-invariance). For any deterministic Online-LOCAL(1) algorithm A that is correct for all orders on paths, τ(u→v) is a function only of K(v). If C1 holds, then the pair of types (τ(left→v), τ(right→v)) together with K(v) determines v’s 1-round transcript and thus v’s output; consequently, v’s output can be written as f(K(v)), yielding a sequential rule with read radius R=2 (W depending on A).\\n- Why plausible: Lemma 8 restricts all relevant pre-v activity to B(v,2). Correctness-for-all-orders constrains the variability of τ(u→v): in particular, if two normalized local histories share K(v), any divergence in τ would imply two global normalized executions that share K(v) but force different decisions at v under the same neighbor messages—this is the crux to be formalized.\\n\\nObstacles and what fails without extra structure\\n- Messages are unbounded in LOCAL, hence in principle τ(u→v) could be infinite and depend on arbitrary pre-window states, even if K(v) is fixed. Without additional constraints, direct finiteness/regularity arguments (e.g., Myhill–Nerode–style) are unavailable.\\n- Local confluence inside B(v,2) is not implied by 2t-commutativity (which only handles dist > 2t). For t=1, arrivals at distance 2 can causally affect a neighbor’s 1-round message to v, and these steps need not commute.\\n\\nWhy the current bridges suffice in natural cases\\n- The output-only model (and its W-write variant) sidesteps the obstacles: each neighbor’s outgoing message during v’s window is a function of outputs within distance 1 of the sender; by Lemma 6, v’s decision depends only on outputs in B(v,2) (or B(v,2+W) for bounded writes), and the color-phased simulation gives O(log* n).\\n- The t-local-dependence variant provides an even tighter radius (R=t) and is common for greedy “decide-at-current-node” online rules.\\n\\nActionable next steps (auditable)\\n1) Formalize C1 or refute it on paths:\\n   - Set up the precise semantics of τ(u→v): enumerate all normalized permutations of arrivals in B(v,2), run A on each (local simulation of a finite tree of executions), and collect the set of possible messages. Prove (or disprove by counterexample) that τ(u→v) depends only on K(v).\\n   - If C1 holds, define f(K(v)) by simulating v’s 1-window using any representative execution consistent with K(v); argue that f yields a well-defined (R=2, W as needed) sequential rule S. Then invoke Lemma 5 to obtain O(log* n) in LOCAL on bounded-degree trees.\\n2) If C1 fails, attempt a weaker canonicalization:\\n   - Show existence of a canonical choice g(K(v)) ∈ τ(u→v) for each interface that still yields a valid global labeling when composed across vertices via color-phased scheduling (this would be a “local mending” style selection).\\n3) Extend Lemma 8 to quantify the precise bound on the number of arrival steps that can affect v: for general t and degree Δ, |B(v,2t)| ≤ Δ^{O(t)}; record this bound for use in exhaustive local simulations.\\n4) Strengthen output.md with an explicit remark that the main theorem presently holds under output-only (and t-local-dependence) hypotheses and that unrestricted Online-LOCAL(t) is open; add Lemma 8 and Lemma 9 as formal tools for the path-interface program.\\n\\nNotes on output.md (gaps/edits)\\n- The listed lemmas are correct as stated. To support the path-interface program, we suggest adding:\\n  • Lemma 8 (strong witness-localization at v) with proof.\\n  • A short bound on |B(v,2t)| and the induced finite enumeration of normalized local orders (Lemma 9).\\n- Clarify in Corollary B that the overall runtime is O((2t+2W)·log* n + O(1)) and dominated by the coloring step for constant Δ, t, W.\\n\\nWhy this round is progress\\n- We strengthened the normalization toolkit (Lemma 8), formalized the interface-type notion for the path/t=1 case, and articulated a precise, falsifiable claim (C1) whose resolution would close the remaining gap. We also scoped a concrete finite-enumeration approach to test C1 and outlined fallback strategies if it fails. These are incremental, auditable steps towards eliminating mutable-state dependence inside B(v,2t) on trees.\"}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"auto","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"ProverOutput","schema_":{"properties":{"progress_md":{"description":"Append-only progress notes","title":"Progress Md","type":"string"}},"required":["progress_md"],"title":"ProverOutput","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":85211,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8835,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":7168},"total_tokens":94046},"user":null,"store":true}
