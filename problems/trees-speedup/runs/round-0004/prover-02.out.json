  "progress_md": "Ideas (closing the main gap)\n- New lemma (faithful phase simulation for arbitrary deterministic Online-LOCAL(t), no extra restrictions): Fix any proper coloring \u03c6 of G^{2t}. There is a deterministic LOCAL simulation that, in O(t\u00b7log* n) (to compute \u03c6) + C\u00b7t rounds (C = \u0394^{O(t)} colors), reproduces exactly the outputs that the online algorithm A would produce on the arrival order that processes color classes 1,2,\u2026,C, with ties inside a color class resolved arbitrarily. On bounded-degree graphs with constant t, this is O(log* n).\n  \u2022 Why this suffices for the task: The online model requires A to succeed for every adversarial order; hence it certainly succeeds for the specific \u201ccolor-by-color\u201d order. Our LOCAL simulation reproduces that run, up to perfect fidelity, yet at a cost of O(log* n) rounds. This directly proves: Any LCL solvable in O(1) rounds in deterministic Online-LOCAL(t) on bounded-degree trees (indeed, bounded-degree graphs) can be solved in O(log* n) rounds in the standard LOCAL model.\n\n- Key observation resolving the prior concern (barrier of unbounded state accumulation): In the color-by-color arrival order, before a vertex v arrives, only vertices of earlier colors have arrived. The online algorithm must work for this order. During phase i, we need to execute the t-round \u201carrival-window\u201d for all vertices v with \u03c6(v)=i. Even though an online execution would conceptually perform these windows sequentially (one at a time), the union of active parts of the system involved in each individual t-window is B(v,t) and, since \u03c6 colors G^{2t}, these t-balls are pairwise disjoint for same-color vertices. Therefore we can execute all these t-windows concurrently in exactly t LOCAL rounds, without interference. No \u201ck\u00b7t\u201d overhead arises, even if the color class has k\u226b1 vertices.\n\nClean statement (to add as a new lemma in output.md)\n- Lemma F (Faithful color-phased simulation of arbitrary deterministic Online-LOCAL(t), W=0). Let A be any deterministic Online-LOCAL(t) algorithm (arrived vertex decides its own output; all previously arrived vertices may maintain arbitrary state across arrivals and participate in the t rounds of subsequent arrivals). Let \u03c6 be a proper coloring of G^{2t} with C colors. There is a deterministic LOCAL algorithm that produces exactly the same outputs as A would produce on the arrival order \u03c3_\u03c6 that processes colors 1,2,\u2026,C, by spending O(t) LOCAL rounds per color and keeping vertices of colors > i passive in phase i. Total round complexity: O(t\u00b7log* n + C\u00b7t) = O(log* n) for bounded \u0394 and constant t.\n  \u2022 Proof sketch (formal details straightforward):\n    1) Compute \u03c6 in O(t\u00b7log* n) rounds (Lemma 1). Fix the arrival order \u03c3_\u03c6: all color-1 vertices arrive first (in any order), then color 2, etc. Since A is correct for every order, it is correct for \u03c3_\u03c6.\n    2) Inductive invariant I(i): After finishing phase i, the global state of all arrived vertices (colors \u2264 i), and the fixed outputs for these vertices, are exactly those that would arise in an online execution of A under \u03c3_\u03c6 after all color-\u2264i vertices have been processed (sequentially in any order within the color), and vertices of colors > i have not yet arrived (absent from the induced subgraph).\n    3) Base i=0: vacuous. Step i\u2192i+1: In phase i+1 we must run the \u201carrival window\u201d (t rounds) for every v with \u03c6(v)=i+1, over the subgraph induced by colors \u2264 i+1, with vertices of colors > i+1 absent. For a single vertex v this t-window involves only nodes in B(v,t); nodes outside B(v,t) cannot influence or be influenced (information cannot travel > t hops in t rounds). If u and v share the same color i+1, then dist(u,v)>2t, hence B(u,t)\u2229B(v,t)=\u2205, and their windows can be executed simultaneously without interference in exactly t rounds. (Previously arrived vertices may participate in these t rounds, but only those inside the corresponding disjoint t-balls.) Therefore, after t rounds, every color-(i+1) vertex has exactly the output it would get in the run of A under \u03c3_\u03c6; all other states/outputs also match, proving I(i+1).\n    4) After phase C we have the outputs A would produce on \u03c3_\u03c6. Since A is correct for all orders, the labeling satisfies \u03a0.\n\n- Variant with bounded writes (optional, for completeness): If A (at arrival of v) may additionally finalize outputs on a patch B(v,W), the same simulation goes through using a proper coloring of G^{2t+2W} (so that the \u201cinfluence regions\u201d B(v,W+t) are disjoint inside a color). In phase i, we run t rounds over the subgraph induced by colors \u2264 i, with vertices of colors > i absent, and let each new vertex v finalize the patch B(v,W). The per-color runtime is still t, and correctness follows by the same invariant. This matches the K = 2t+2W bound already used in Lemma 5/Corollary B.\n\nWhy this closes the loop\n- The main task asks to simulate any O(1)-round deterministic online-local algorithm on bounded-degree trees in O(log* n) LOCAL rounds. Lemma F does exactly that (and for general bounded-degree graphs), relying only on (i) a distance-(2t) coloring and (ii) faithful, batched execution of t-windows per color. No restrictions such as \u201coutput-only\u201d or \u201ct-local-dependence\u201d are needed. The essential ingredient is that A must succeed for every arrival order, so we are free to choose the color-by-color order.\n\nSanity checks and examples\n- Path graph, t=1, \u201clong-haul state accumulation\u201d algorithm A. Even if one can design A so that, under some orders, far-away information travels across many arrivals before a vertex v appears, A must also succeed under order \u03c3_\u03c6, where only O(1) color classes arrive before v. Our simulation reproduces precisely that run of A; hence the output is valid. The earlier apparent obstacle (needing \u0398(n)\u00b7t global rounds pre-arrival) is resolved by choosing a benign order.\n- Toy parallelization check: two new vertices u,v at distance \u22652t in the same phase. In A, if processed sequentially, first arrival\u2019s t rounds touch only B(\u00b7,t), then the second\u2019s t rounds touch only the other t-ball; batching them into one t-round block yields identical transcripts in the two disjoint neighborhoods.\n\nGaps or edits needed in output.md\n- Current output.md (Round 0003) contains:\n  \u2022 Bridges for output-only and for t-local-dependence (Lemmas 3\u20134), the corrected bounded-writes simulation (Lemma 5 with K = max(2W,R+W)), the output-only W-write bridge (Lemma 6), and the commutativity lemma (Lemma 7). All are correct as stated.\n  \u2022 Missing piece: an explicit lemma for the general Online-LOCAL(t) case without extra restrictions (the new Lemma F above). This is the central statement that directly yields the desired O(log* n) upper bound for arbitrary deterministic online-local algorithms on bounded-degree trees.\n- Actionable addition for output.md: Add Lemma F (as above) and its proof. Then state the main theorem as a corollary: On bounded-degree trees (indeed, graphs), any LCL \u03a0 solvable in O(1) rounds in deterministic Online-LOCAL(t) admits an O(log* n) deterministic LOCAL algorithm. Optionally include the bounded-writes variant using a G^{2t+2W}-coloring.\n\nRelation to earlier commutativity tool\n- Lemma 7 and Corollary 7.1 remain useful generally (e.g., for order normalization arguments, or if one prefers a proof with an explicit swapping argument). However, Lemma F gives a simpler, direct construction via a fixed order \u03c3_\u03c6.\n\nObstacles and caveats to keep in mind\n- Model semantics: In each phase we must ensure that vertices of colors > i are \u201cabsent\u201d: they neither send nor receive messages. This is easily enforced in the LOCAL simulation by having these nodes ignore messages (remain silent) until their phase.\n- Independence radius: The 2t separation is tight for W=0. With W>0, use 2t+2W so that the influence regions B(v,W+t) are disjoint inside a color. This matches the corrected K in Lemma 5 (max(2W,R+W) specialized with R=W+t for the online window\u2019s read neighborhood of the patch).\n- Per-phase runtime: Exactly t rounds suffice; we do not need k\u00b7t even if the color class size is k, thanks to disjointness of the active regions.\n\nNext steps (auditable)\n1) Insert Lemma F into output.md with a rigorous inductive proof of invariant I(i); include the bounded-writes variant (coloring G^{2t+2W}).\n2) State the main theorem as a clean corollary and explicitly emphasize that the argument does not rely on orientations (nonoriented trees are fine) nor on tree structure (it works for bounded-degree graphs).\n3) Provide a short \u201cpitfall\u201d remark explaining why the earlier worry about long state accumulation is resolved by choosing a suitable arrival order, and why batching t-windows per color costs only t rounds.\n4) Optionally keep the bridges (Lemmas 3\u20136) as auxiliary tools\u2014they remain correct and are useful independently (e.g., if one wants a sequential-rule perspective).\n\nWhy this is meaningful progress\n- We isolate and formalize the decisive lemma (faithful batched simulation of arbitrary deterministic online-local t-windows by colors), with a tight radius argument and runtime accounting. This cleanly settles the stated task for (nonoriented) bounded-degree trees and, in fact, for bounded-degree graphs. The lemma is ready to be integrated into output.md as a short but complete proof component.\n"
