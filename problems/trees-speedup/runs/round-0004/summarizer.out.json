  "summary_md": "This round produced two complementary advances. prover-01 strengthened the normalization toolkit (Lemma 8: strong witness-localization at v) and gave a finite-enumeration lemma for t=1 on paths (Lemma 9), defined interface types \u03c4(u\u2192v) and posed Claim C1 (\u03c4 depends only on K(v)) as a focal, testable route to convert arbitrary Online-LOCAL(1) rules on paths into sequential rules. prover-02 answered the main gap directly: Lemma F shows a faithful color-phased simulation for any deterministic Online-LOCAL(t) by choosing the color-by-color arrival order \u03c3_\u03c6 (coloring G^{2t}) and executing each color\u2019s t-round windows in parallel. This reproduces A\u2019s outputs exactly and yields an O(t\u00b7log* n + C\u00b7t) = O(log* n) LOCAL algorithm for bounded-degree constant-t graphs; bounded-writes extend via coloring G^{2t+2W}. In short: the main open concern about long-range mutable-state accumulation is resolved by simulating a specific benign order. Next steps: integrate Lemma F into output.md and resolve/prove or refute C1 for the path t=1 program. Citations: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json.",
  "highlights": [
    "Lemma 8 (strong witness-localization): arrivals at distance >2t can be swapped past v without changing B(v,t) local state or fixed outputs at v\u2019s arrival.",
    "Lemma 9: on paths with t=1, the set of normalized arrival orders restricted to B(v,2) is finite (bounded by c(\u0394)), enabling exhaustive local enumeration.",
    "Interface program (paths, t=1): define \u03c4(u\u2192v) (possible 1-round messages from neighbor u) and Claim C1 that \u03c4 depends only on K(v) (fixed outputs in B(v,2)); C1 would yield a sequential R=2 rule if true.",
    "Obstacle noted: unbounded messages and potential internal nonconfluence in B(v,2) mean C1 is nontrivial and may fail without extra structure.",
    "Lemma F (faithful color-phased simulation): for any deterministic Online-LOCAL(t), color G^{2t} and run color-by-color; same-color t-balls are disjoint so all windows per color run in t rounds, yielding exact outputs for \u03c3_\u03c6.",
    "Consequence: Any LCL solvable in O(1) rounds in deterministic Online-LOCAL(t) on bounded-degree graphs/trees admits an O(log* n) deterministic LOCAL algorithm; bounded-writes use G^{2t+2W}."

    "Integrate Lemma F (and its bounded-writes variant) into output.md and state the main theorem as a corollary; add a short proof and the per-phase invariant I(i).",
    "Pursue the path t=1 interface program: formalize \u03c4(u\u2192v) precisely, then prove Claim C1 or produce an explicit counterexample; if C1 fails, try to construct a canonical local selection g(K(v)).",
    "Add formal bounds to lemmas (e.g., |B(v,2t)| \u2264 \u0394^{O(t)}) and include Lemma 8 and Lemma 9 proofs in output.md to support any exhaustive local-simulation/verification steps."
