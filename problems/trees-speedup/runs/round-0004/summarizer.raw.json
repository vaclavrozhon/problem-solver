This reproduces A’s outputs exactly and yields an O(t·log* n + C·t) = O(log* n) LOCAL algorithm for bounded-degree constant-t graphs; bounded-writes extend via coloring G^{2t+2W}. In short: the main open concern about long-range mutable-state accumulation is resolved by simulating a specific benign order. Next steps: integrate Lemma F into output.md and resolve/prove or refute C1 for the path t=1 program.
