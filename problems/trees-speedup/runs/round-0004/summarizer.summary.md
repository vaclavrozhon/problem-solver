This round produced two complementary advances. prover-01 strengthened the normalization toolkit (Lemma 8: strong witness-localization at v) and gave a finite-enumeration lemma for t=1 on paths (Lemma 9), defined interface types τ(u→v) and posed Claim C1 (τ depends only on K(v)) as a focal, testable route to convert arbitrary Online-LOCAL(1) rules on paths into sequential rules. prover-02 answered the main gap directly: Lemma F shows a faithful color-phased simulation for any deterministic Online-LOCAL(t) by choosing the color-by-color arrival order σ_φ (coloring G^{2t}) and executing each color’s t-round windows in parallel. This reproduces A’s outputs exactly and yields an O(t·log* n + C·t) = O(log* n) LOCAL algorithm for bounded-degree constant-t graphs; bounded-writes extend via coloring G^{2t+2W}. In short: the main open concern about long-range mutable-state accumulation is resolved by simulating a specific benign order. Next steps: integrate Lemma F into output.md and resolve/prove or refute C1 for the path t=1 program. Citations: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json.
