  "summary_md": "This round produced two complementary advances. prover-01 strengthened the normalization toolkit (Lemma 8: strong witness-localization at v) and gave a finite-enumeration lemma for t=1 on paths (Lemma 9), defined interface types τ(u→v) and posed Claim C1 (τ depends only on K(v)) as a focal, testable route to convert arbitrary Online-LOCAL(1) rules on paths into sequential rules. prover-02 answered the main gap directly: Lemma F shows a faithful color-phased simulation for any deterministic Online-LOCAL(t) by choosing the color-by-color arrival order σ_φ (coloring G^{2t}) and executing each color’s t-round windows in parallel. This reproduces A’s outputs exactly and yields an O(t·log* n + C·t) = O(log* n) LOCAL algorithm for bounded-degree constant-t graphs; bounded-writes extend via coloring G^{2t+2W}. In short: the main open concern about long-range mutable-state accumulation is resolved by simulating a specific benign order. Next steps: integrate Lemma F into output.md and resolve/prove or refute C1 for the path t=1 program. Citations: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json.",
  "highlights": [
    "Lemma 8 (strong witness-localization): arrivals at distance >2t can be swapped past v without changing B(v,t) local state or fixed outputs at v’s arrival.",
    "Lemma 9: on paths with t=1, the set of normalized arrival orders restricted to B(v,2) is finite (bounded by c(Δ)), enabling exhaustive local enumeration.",
    "Interface program (paths, t=1): define τ(u→v) (possible 1-round messages from neighbor u) and Claim C1 that τ depends only on K(v) (fixed outputs in B(v,2)); C1 would yield a sequential R=2 rule if true.",
    "Obstacle noted: unbounded messages and potential internal nonconfluence in B(v,2) mean C1 is nontrivial and may fail without extra structure.",
    "Lemma F (faithful color-phased simulation): for any deterministic Online-LOCAL(t), color G^{2t} and run color-by-color; same-color t-balls are disjoint so all windows per color run in t rounds, yielding exact outputs for σ_φ.",
    "Consequence: Any LCL solvable in O(1) rounds in deterministic Online-LOCAL(t) on bounded-degree graphs/trees admits an O(log* n) deterministic LOCAL algorithm; bounded-writes use G^{2t+2W}."
