Summary and triage
- The previously archived bridge lemmas (sequential rules with bounded reads/writes; output-only and t-local-dependence reductions; corrected K = max(2W, R+W)) remain correct and valuable. They provide a clean O(log* n) pipeline for output-only/t-local-dependence variants.

Audit of Prover 02 (claimed Lemma F: faithful batched simulation for unrestricted Online-LOCAL(t))
- Core flaw: In the unrestricted Online-LOCAL(t) semantics, during each arrival step the t synchronous rounds execute over all arrived vertices. Even nodes outside B(v,t) of the newly arrived v may update their local state (e.g., by incrementing a counter) despite receiving no messages. In a sequential online run with k arrivals in a color class, every previously arrived node executes k such “idle” updates. The proposed O(t) per-color batched simulation updates those nodes only once, not k times, so the inductive invariant “global state after phase i matches the online run after all arrivals of colors ≤ i” fails in general.
- Concrete counterexample (sketch; formalized in notes/output): Consider the trivial LCL that accepts any labeling. Online algorithm A(t=1): every arrived node maintains a parity bit p that toggles at every arrival; the newly arrived node v, in 1 round, reads p from a neighbor (if any) and outputs that parity. In the sequential σ_φ-run (colors 1..C, any internal order) the outputs of same-color vertices alternate with the internal order because p toggles each arrival. A batched O(1)-round simulation that processes all same-color vertices simultaneously cannot reproduce these alternating outputs: all these vertices would see the same p originating from earlier colors and output the same bit. Hence “faithful reproduction” is false in general.
- Where their proof goes wrong: the assertion that “the union of active parts of the system involved in each individual t-window is B(v,t)” is incorrect for unrestricted Online-LOCAL(t). Nodes outside B(v,t) are active and can change state in each step, even if they see no messages. Compressing k steps to 1 step per phase requires knowing k and applying k-fold local updates everywhere; this is not locally computable in o(diameter) rounds in general.
- Bottom line: Do not add Lemma F. The overall “pick a benign order σ_φ and simulate it with O(t) per color” strategy is invalid without extra structure that prevents or neutralizes “idle” state evolution far from the arriving node.

Audit of Prover 01
- Lemma 8 (“strong witness localization”) is essentially Corollary 7.1 already present in output.md; it is correct and useful. (We suggest keeping one unified statement; no need to duplicate.)
- Lemma 9 (“finite local enumeration for t=1 on paths”) is false as stated under standard LOCAL assumptions: messages/states can encode IDs, so even with a constant-size ball B(v,2) and finite permutations of arrivals, the set of possible transcripts seen by v need not be bounded by a constant independent of n. Finite enumeration becomes viable only under additional constraints (e.g., ID-obliviousness, bounded message alphabets, bounded state, or output-only).
- Claim C1 (“context-invariance” for paths, t=1) is an interesting target but is unlikely to hold without constraints, for the same reason: nodes in B(v,2) can adopt different states/messages that depend on the number of far-away arrivals (step count), even when K(v) (the pattern of fixed outputs in B(v,2)) is the same. If pursued, restrict to regimes where messages/states depend only on local outputs (output-only) or impose quiescence/ID-obliviousness.

Promising directions and concrete next steps
1) Document and internalize the negative: add a rigorous “pitfall” remark (with counterexample) to output.md preventing reintroduction of the flawed batched-simulation idea for unrestricted Online-LOCAL(t).
2) If one wants an O(log* n) reduction via batched phases, introduce an explicit quiescence assumption: in every arrival step, nodes outside B(v,t) perform the identity state update (or state evolution independent of the number of steps). Under such a constraint, the per-color t-round batching becomes valid. Formalize and prove this variant if it is of interest; relate it to the already-established output-only and t-local-dependence bridges.
3) Path/t=1 interface program: proceed with caution. Either:
   - Prove C1 under added structure (e.g., output-only or bounded-state/ID-oblivious), or
   - Refute C1 in the unrestricted model by exhibiting a neighbor-interface that depends on step count despite fixed K(v) (build on the parity-counter idea). In both cases, keep the analysis confined to B(v,2) using Corollary 7.1.
4) Maintain the corrected K = max(2W, R+W) accounting throughout. Optionally add a brief complexity remark to output.md (O((2t+2W)·log* n) dominated by the coloring step for bounded Δ,t,W).

Net assessment
- Keep all existing rigorous bridges. Do not add Lemma F. Treat Lemma 8 as already covered by Corollary 7.1. Discard Lemma 9 as currently invalid. Focus next on either tightening assumptions (quiescence/output-only) to close the pipeline, or constructing a clean counterexample to Claim C1 in the unrestricted model.
