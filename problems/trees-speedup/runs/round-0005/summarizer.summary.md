This round isolated a clean “quiescence” condition that blocks the idle-state accumulation failure of the earlier batching idea and proved a tight Local simulation under that assumption. Quiescent Online-LOCAL(t) means that when vertex v arrives only nodes in B(v,t) may change state (with a W-write variant allowing irrevocable outputs in B(v,W)). Lemma Q: any LCL with a deterministic quiescent Online-LOCAL(t) (W=0) yields a deterministic LOCAL algorithm in O(log* n) rounds; more generally, (W,t)-quiescent gives O((2t+2W)·log* n) via a G^{K}-coloring with K=2t (or 2t+2W). The round also confirms that Lemma 7 (2t-commutativity) remains valid even with deterministic idle updates that depend on step index. Two routes remain to close the full result: (A) transform arbitrary Online-LOCAL(t) on trees into a quiescent version (state-elimination), or (B) prove a lower bound (via localized round-elimination for sinkless orientation) showing constant-t online cannot solve the log-n-hard class, which combined with tree LCL classification gives the O(log* n) corollary. Verifier: partial success.
