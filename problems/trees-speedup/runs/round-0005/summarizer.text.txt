{"summary_md":"This round isolated a clean “quiescence” condition that blocks the idle-state accumulation failure of the earlier batching idea and proved a tight Local simulation under that assumption. Quiescent Online-LOCAL(t) means that when vertex v arrives only nodes in B(v,t) may change state (with a W-write variant allowing irrevocable outputs in B(v,W)). Lemma Q: any LCL with a deterministic quiescent Online-LOCAL(t) (W=0) yields a deterministic LOCAL algorithm in O(log* n) rounds; more generally, (W,t)-quiescent gives O((2t+2W)·log* n) via a G^{K}-coloring with K=2t (or 2t+2W). The round also confirms that Lemma 7 (2t-commutativity) remains valid even with deterministic idle updates that depend on step index. Two routes remain to close the full result: (A) transform arbitrary Online-LOCAL(t) on trees into a quiescent version (state-elimination), or (B) prove a lower bound (via localized round-elimination for sinkless orientation) showing constant-t online cannot solve the log-n-hard class, which combined with tree LCL classification gives the O(log* n) corollary. Verifier: partial success.","highlights":["Defined quiescent Online-LOCAL(t): only B(v,t) may change during v’s t-round window; extended to (W,t)-quiescence allowing irrevocable writes in B(v,W).","Lemma Q: quiescent Online-LOCAL(t) ⇒ deterministic LOCAL in O(log* n); bounded-write case uses K=2t+2W coloring and per-color t-round parallel simulation.","Quiescence subsumes output-only bridges, fixing the earlier batching flaw caused by distant idle updates (parity counterexample still shows non-quiescent obstruction).","Clarified Lemma 7 (2t-commutativity) is sound under arbitrary deterministic idle updates that may depend on step index; add explicit remark to output.md.","Concrete program: either (i) state-elimination-by-quiescence on trees (start with paths, t=1), or (ii) prove constant-t impossibility for sinkless orientation via localized LB.1/LB.2 lemmas to derive the O(log* n) corollary non-constructively.","Next edits: add Lemma Q (with W extension) and a brief Lemma 7 clarification to output.md; maintain existing negative batching remark."],"next_questions":["Add Lemma Q (quiescent ⇒ O(log* n)) to output.md (include W-write variant and K=2t / 2t+2W parameters) and insert the suggested clarifying sentence after Lemma 7.","Attempt state-elimination-by-quiescence on paths with t=1: formalize Σ(u→v) (the neighbor interface) and try to prove context-invariance; if it fails, produce an explicit LCL/path counterexample.","Formalize and prove LB.1 and LB.2 (localized node→edge elimination and iteration to 0 rounds) for sinkless orientation on Δ-regular trees to derive the lower bound that constant-t online cannot solve log-n-hard LCLs; then conclude the non-constructive O(log* n) corollary." ]}
