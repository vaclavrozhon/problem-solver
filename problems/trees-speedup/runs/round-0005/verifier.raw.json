The proposed quiescence hypothesis is a natural and useful way to capture many practical greedy/patch-based online algorithms. There is genuine value here; however, some technical details in the statements need tightening before inclusion in output.md.\\n\\nKey corrections and clarifications\\n- Separation radius K: To safely run all same-color arrivals in parallel for t rounds, it is not enough to color G^{2t} (or G^{2t+2W}). If two same-color centers v,w have dist(v,w)=2t+1, their active regions B(v,t) and B(w,t) are disjoint but can be adjacent by an edge. Then, during the t-window, messages can cross that single edge in 1 round and couple the two simulations. To forbid any direct edge between distinct active regions, we need dist(v,w) ≥ 2t+2, i.e., a proper coloring of G^{2t+1} (and, with writes W, G^{2t+2W+1}). This “+1” is necessary for rigorous independence of same-color windows in parallel.\\n- Message forwarding vs quiescence: In the standard LOCAL round semantics (send at start-of-round from current state; receive; then update state), if nodes outside the active region do not change state during the t rounds, they cannot forward newly received information in subsequent rounds: their outgoing messages in each round depend only on their fixed state. Hence no influence can traverse a path that leaves an active region and re-enters another unless there is an edge directly between the two active regions. This is why the K=2t+1 (resp. 2t+2W+1) separation suffices; we do not additionally need to assume that “idle” nodes send no messages, provided we adhere to the standard LOCAL timing semantics and the “no state change outside” clause.\\n- Step-index dependence and Lemma 7: The commutativity lemma remains sound even if idle nodes apply deterministic updates depending on the global step index. After swapping two consecutive steps, idle nodes still experience exactly the same two step indices in the same order; hence their sequence of updates is identical. It is good to add a clarifying remark to pre-empt confusion.\\n\\nWith these fixes, the quiescent bridge can be safely added to output.md. It properly generalizes the earlier output-only bridges and cleanly delineates where batching works.\\n\\nPromising directions and next steps\\n1) Integrate the corrected quiescent bridge. Use K=2t+1 (or 2t+2W+1) and be explicit about the LOCAL round semantics used in the proof. State that disjoint active regions at distance ≥2 and quiescence forbid cross-talk in the t-window.\\n2) State-elimination-by-quiescence on trees (start with paths, t=1): precisely formalize the interface Σ(u→v) and “normalized executions” (via Cor. 7.1). Try to prove context-invariance: fixing outputs on B(v,2) fixes the feasible behaviors/messages toward v. If this holds, define a canonical interface and obtain a quiescent rule; if not, produce a counterexample LCL on paths.\\n3) Lower bound track (as in Prover 02): Formalize LB.1 (localized node↔edge elimination within B(e,2t)) and LB.2 (iteration to 0 rounds) for sinkless orientation on trees under Online-LOCAL(t). Cor. 7.1 gives the needed normalization. This would non-constructively imply that any LCL with constant-t Online-LOCAL on trees lies in the O(1)/Θ(log* n) class, giving the desired O(log* n) LOCAL bound.\\n\\nAll these items are complementary; we can make immediate progress by adding the quiescent bridge (with the corrected K) and then pursue either the transformation-to-quiescence or the lower-bound route.\",\"new_notes_md\":\"New bridge via quiescence (precise form) and radius accounting\\n- Definition (quiescent Online-LOCAL(t), standard LOCAL timing). In each arrival step for v, the algorithm runs t synchronous LOCAL rounds on the arrived subgraph. Messages sent in round r depend only on the node’s state at the start of round r; at the end of the round, nodes update their state based on received messages. The algorithm is quiescent if, during the t rounds triggered by v’s arrival, every node u with dist(u,v) > t does not change its state in any of these t rounds. (Under the above timing, such u cannot forward newly received information in subsequent rounds because its outgoing messages in round r depend only on its unchanged state.)\\n- (W,t)-quiescent: If the algorithm may irrevocably write outputs on a patch B(v,W) during v’s window, we call it (W,t)-quiescent if only nodes in B(v,W+t) may change state in that window.\\n\\n- Correct separation for parallel batching: To parallelize all same-color windows for t rounds without interference, it is necessary to forbid any edge between distinct active regions. For W=0 the active region for v is B(v,t). Thus, a proper coloring of G^{2t+1} (not merely G^{2t}) guarantees that for same-color u,v, dist(u,v) ≥ 2t+2, hence dist(B(u,t), B(v,t)) ≥ 2. This eliminates one-hop coupling across region boundaries. With W>0, color G^{2t+2W+1} so that distinct active regions B(·,W+t) have mutual distance ≥ 2.\\n\\n- Why quiescence removes the “idle-accumulation” pitfall: In the unrestricted model, nodes can encode the number of prior arrivals into their state and/or messages, letting each new window see different ambient information; batching then fails. Under quiescence, any vertex whose t-window has not yet been processed cannot track steps that do not involve it, so its local view (modulo the already-arrived graph and earlier colors) is invariant across the internal order within a color class. Combined with the ≥2 separation between active regions, the parallel t-round simulation per color faithfully matches any sequential permutation of that color.\\n\\n- Examples that fit quiescence: Greedy MIS and greedy maximal matching on bounded-degree graphs (W=1, t=1) where only the newly active 1-neighborhood changes, and (Δ+1)-vertex-coloring rules that finalize a 1-hop patch around the arrival.\\n\\nRemark on Lemma 7 (2t-commutativity)\\n- The lemma remains valid even if nodes outside B(u,t) ∪ B(w,t) perform deterministic updates depending only on the global step index (and not on messages). Those nodes experience the same two consecutive step indices before and after the swap; hence their pair of updates is identical.\\n\\nLower-bound program (outline) for Online-LOCAL on trees\\n- Target: Prove that sinkless orientation on bounded-degree trees admits no deterministic Online-LOCAL(t)=O(1) algorithm (adversarial arrival). Use Lemma 7/Cor. 7.1 to normalize prefixes so that only B(e,2t) arrives before deciding edge e. Then adapt the node↔edge round-elimination locally inside B(e,2t), iterating 2t times to obtain a 0-round contradiction with the ID-graph property. Formalizing this (LB.1–LB.2) would non-constructively imply: any LCL with constant-t Online-LOCAL on trees lies in the O(1)/Θ(log* n) class, so there exists an O(log* n) deterministic LOCAL algorithm.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Integrate the quiescent bridge with K=2t+1 (resp. 2t+2W+1) into output.md.\\n- Begin the path (t=1) state-elimination-by-quiescence attempt with a precise interface Σ(u→v) and normalized histories (via Cor. 7.1).

Suppose Π has a deterministic quiescent Online-LOCAL(t) algorithm A with constant t.\\n(i) Then Π admits a deterministic LOCAL algorithm with round complexity O((2t+1)·log* n + t·Δ^{O(t)}) = O(log* n).\\n(ii) More generally, if A is (W,t)-quiescent with constants W,t, then Π admits a deterministic LOCAL algorithm with round complexity O((2t+2W+1)·log* n + t·Δ^{O(t+W)}) = O(log* n).\\n\\nProof.\\nFix K := 2t+1 in case (i), and K := 2t+2W+1 in case (ii). By Lemma 1, compute a proper coloring φ of G^{K} with C = Δ^{O(K)} colors in O(K·log* n) rounds. We process the colors in increasing order i = 1,2,…,C in phases; at the start of phase i, exactly the vertices of colors < i are considered “already arrived,” and vertices of colors ≥ i are “not yet arrived.”\\n\\nIn phase i we simulate, in parallel, the t-round online arrival window of every vertex v with φ(v)=i, on the subgraph induced by vertices of colors ≤ i, as follows: (a) we declare all vertices of color i to “arrive” at the beginning of the phase, and (b) we perform t synchronous LOCAL rounds on that induced subgraph. During this phase, the algorithm A is executed faithfully at every vertex, except that vertices of colors > i are absent.\\n\\nLet R_v denote the active region of v during this phase: R_v = B(v,t) in case (i) and R_v = B(v, W+t) in case (ii). Because φ colors G^{K} with K as above, for any two distinct same-color vertices v,w we have dist(v,w) ≥ K+1, hence dist(R_v, R_w) ≥ 2. In particular, there is no edge between R_v and R_w.\\n\\nQuiescence and the LOCAL timing imply two key facts within phase i:\\n1) Only nodes in R := ⋃_{φ(v)=i} R_v may change state during the t rounds of phase i; all nodes outside R keep their state fixed throughout the phase. Since messages sent in a round depend only on the sender’s current state at the start of that round, such outside nodes cannot forward newly received information in subsequent rounds. Consequently, there is no causal influence along any path that leaves one R_v and re-enters another R_w within the t rounds, because such a path must traverse at least one node outside R which cannot propagate new information.\\n2) Since dist(R_v, R_w) ≥ 2, there is neither an edge nor a length-1 path between distinct active regions.\\n\\nFrom 1)–2) it follows that, during phase i, the evolution of each R_v is identical to what would occur if we executed only v’s t-round window in isolation (with all other color-i vertices absent), given the same boundary states on the external neighborhood of R_v (which are precisely the states fixed by earlier colors). Formally, this can be proved by induction on the round counter r=1,…,t, using the domain-of-dependence that is confined to R_v together with outside nodes whose states remain constant.\\n\\nTherefore, the combined effect of phase i equals the composition of the individual “v-arrival” windows over all vertices v with φ(v)=i, in any internal order. By induction on i, after finishing phase i the global state/output coincides with the online execution that processes first all color-1 vertices (in an arbitrary order), then all color-2 vertices, and so on. Since A is correct for every arrival order, the final labeling after phase C is legal for Π.\\n\\nThe complexity is O(K·log* n) to obtain φ and t rounds per color, i.e., O(t·C) additional rounds. For constant Δ, t, W, we have C = Δ^{O(K)} = O(1), so the total is O(log* n). □\\n\\nRemark (on the choice of K). The choice K = 2t (resp. 2t+2W) is insufficient for the parallel phase: if dist(v,w)=2t+1 (resp. 2t+2W+1), then R_v and R_w are disjoint but may be adjacent by an edge, allowing one-round coupling between the two active regions. The value K = 2t+1 (resp. 2t+2W+1) guarantees dist(R_v, R_w) ≥ 2, which prevents such coupling and makes the above proof sound.\\n\\nRemark after Lemma 7 (idle updates depending on step index). In Lemma 7, nodes outside B(u,t) ∪ B(w,t) may perform deterministic updates that depend on the global step counter but not on messages. When two consecutive arrivals at u and w with dist(u,w) > 2t are swapped, those nodes still undergo the same two consecutive step indices in the same order, so their pair of updates is unchanged. This clarifies that Lemma 7 tolerates such idle updates.\",\"new_outputs_append\":\"True\",\"verdict\":\"partial success\"}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"auto","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"VerifierNewSchema","schema_":{"properties":{"feedback_md":{"title":"Feedback Md","type":"string"},"new_notes_md":{"title":"New Notes Md","type":"string"},"new_notes_append":{"title":"New Notes Append","type":"string"},"new_outputs_md":{"title":"New Outputs Md","type":"string"},"new_outputs_append":{"title":"New Outputs Append","type":"string"},"verdict":{"title":"Verdict","type":"string"}},"required":["feedback_md","new_notes_md","new_notes_append","new_outputs_md","new_outputs_append","verdict"],"title":"VerifierNewSchema","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":12152,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":25805,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":22656},"total_tokens":37957},"user":null,"store":true}
