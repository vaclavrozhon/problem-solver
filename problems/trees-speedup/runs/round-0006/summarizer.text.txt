  "summary_md": "This round (prover-02) tightened the output.md and the lower-bound plan. The write-up now includes: output-only bridges, read/write simulation with corrected radius K = max(2W,R+W), a 2t-commutativity lemma, and a corrected quiescent bridge (Lemma 8) requiring K = 2t+1 (or 2t+2W+1) for safe per-color batching under standard LOCAL timing. The main new direction is a localized round-elimination program on trees: LB.1 (node→edge reduction inside B(e,2t)) and LB.2 (iterate 2t steps to reach a 0-round prescription), which would rule out any constant-t deterministic Online-LOCAL solution for sinkless orientation and thus imply the desired existential O(log* n) LOCAL upper bound for any LCL solvable in O(1) Online-LOCAL(t) on bounded-degree trees. A constructive alternative (path, t=1) was proposed: try to canonicalize neighbor interfaces inside B(v,2) to force quiescence, or produce a counterexample. Remaining work: formalize gluing/edge→node half-step and carry out the path t=1 analysis. Verifier: partial success. Files: prover-02.out.json, prover-01.out.json.",
