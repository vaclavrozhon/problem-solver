High-level assessment. Both reports push in two complementary directions. The positive route (quiescent bridge) looks clean, and the proposed Phase-locality lemma (your Lemma 10) is exactly the missing invariant to make Lemma 8 watertight. The negative (lower-bound) route via localized round-elimination is promising but still has a substantive gap: the non-conflict (“double grab implies contradiction”) step for Lemma LB.1 is not yet justified under the current problem formalization.

What is solid and ready to archive. (i) A strong witness-localization statement at a vertex v (your Lemma 9) is correct and useful; it is essentially a refined form of Corollary 7.1 already in output.md but with explicitly stated items (i)–(iii). The standard proof bubbles v leftward across predecessors at distance > 2t using Lemma 7; this keeps the set of pre-v arrivals inside B(v,2t) unchanged and preserves the state on B(v,t). (ii) The Phase-locality invariant inside a color phase under (W,t)-quiescence is correct. The key is the ≥2 separation between active regions and the standard LOCAL timing (send-from-state, then receive, then update). Nodes outside the union of active regions maintain their state; hence they cannot forward newly received information in later rounds. This yields round-by-round independence of disjoint active regions. These two items can be safely added to output.md.

Critical gap in LB.1 (node→edge step). The proposed “non-conflict via gluing” argument is not valid as stated for the node-form of sinkless orientation (each node chooses an outgoing incident edge). If both endpoints u and v of e have local arrival histories that make them “grab” e in opposite directions, gluing those histories does not contradict correctness: in the node-form problem, both endpoints can choose the same edge (towards each other) without violating the constraint “every node has at least one outgoing edge.” Even in an edge-formulation, online irrevocability typically prevents the later endpoint from overriding the earlier edge orientation, so one needs a proof that the later endpoint is forced into an impossible action, which is not established by the current gluing sketch.

How to fix LB.1. You have at least three viable options; pick one and formalize carefully:
- Edge-form LCL with decisive step at the second endpoint: Specify that the orientation of an edge is decided exactly at the arrival of the second endpoint, and this decision is encoded redundantly (or consistently) at both endpoints. Then “double-witness in opposite directions” truly yields a contradiction, because the same global arrival order realizes both local histories up to the decisive step, forcing an impossible edge orientation at the decisive moment.
- Universal (rather than existential) definition in the elimination step: Define the edge rule so that e is oriented u→v only if all normalized local arrival orders within the ball (consistent with the same boundary) make the node-form algorithm orient e from u to v at the decisive step. This avoids non-uniqueness but makes the induction stronger; you must then show that universal quantification is preserved under the elimination iteration. This mirrors classical round-elimination proofs that work with sets of allowed labels.
- A normalization-and-extension lemma as a standalone technical tool: Precisely state and prove that any normalized local arrival schedule inside B(e,2t) extends to a global schedule whose transcript inside B(e,t) (up to and including the decisive step for e) is identical. This is necessary in any case; however, it is not sufficient to resolve the non-conflict issue unless one of the above modeling choices is made.

Other actionable cleanups. (i) Add an explicit “boundary-state sufficiency” sub-claim inside Lemma 8 (your Lemma 10) and point out why K = 2t+2W+1 is minimal: dist(R_v,R_w) ≥ 2 is the real invariant. (ii) After Corollary B, add a remark clarifying why no +1 is needed there (we simulate a derived sequential (R,W)-rule with K = max(2W,R+W), not batched online t-windows). (iii) For the path, t=1 interface program, either push towards a proof of context-invariance under added constraints (e.g., output-only or quiescent), or produce a concrete counterexample on paths if unrestricted; in either case, keep the discussion confined to constant-radius balls via the new witness-localization.

Bottom line and next steps. I have appended to output.md: (1) Lemma 9 (strong witness-localization at v) with a clean proof, and (2) Claim 8.1 formalizing phase-locality under quiescence within Lemma 8, plus (3) a short remark explaining the +1 discrepancy. For the lower-bound route, before adding LB.1/LB.2 to output.md, please fix the model and non-conflict step as above and write the normalization-and-extension lemma with precise quantifiers and a complete proof. This will make the elimination pipeline auditable end-to-end.
