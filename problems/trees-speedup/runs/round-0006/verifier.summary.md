High-level assessment. Both reports push in two complementary directions. The positive route (quiescent bridge) looks clean, and the proposed Phase-locality lemma (your Lemma 10) is exactly the missing invariant to make Lemma 8 watertight. The negative (lower-bound) route via localized round-elimination is promising but still has a substantive gap: the non-conflict (“double grab implies contradiction”) step for Lemma LB.1 is not yet justified under the current problem formalization.
