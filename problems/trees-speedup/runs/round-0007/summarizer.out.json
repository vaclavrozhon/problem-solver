  "summary_md": "This round develops the missing normalization and non-conflict ingredients needed to finish the localized round-elimination lower bound for Online-LOCAL(t) on bounded-degree trees. Main contributions: (1) Lemma NE (Normalization-and-Extension around an edge) formalizes that any normalized local arrival schedule inside B(e,2t) can be realized by a global schedule and that outside arrivals can be pushed past the decisive moment without affecting B(e,t). (2) A sharp \u201c+1\u201d minimality counterexample shows K = 2t+2W+1 is necessary for quiescent batching. (3) The node\u2192edge elimination is reworked into a universal, set-valued step (LB.1u) that defines S_e(\u03b2) by universal quantification over normalized local schedules; non-conflict is then immediate. An alternative decisive-edge semantics (LB.1e) yields uniqueness and an existential reduction. Iterating the universal elimination 2t times gives a 0-round set-labeling that should contradict the ID-graph property (LB.2). Next steps are to formalize the symmetric edge\u2192node half-step, finish the quantified proofs, and integrate everything into output.md. Citations: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json.",

    "Lemma NE: precise normalization-and-extension around an edge \u2014 normalized local schedules on B(e,2t) extend to global schedules and outside arrivals can be swapped/pushed past the decisive step (uses Lemma 7/2t-commutativity).",
    "Minimality +1: K = 2t+2W+1 is necessary for (W,t)-quiescent batching; a path example (W=0,t=1) demonstrates immediate one-edge coupling if +1 is omitted.",
    "Universal node\u2192edge elimination (LB.1u): define S_e(\u03b2) as the set of orientations universally forced by all normalized local schedules consistent with boundary snapshot \u03b2; avoids the earlier double-witness pitfall.",
    "Edge-decided semantics / LB.1e: if orientation is fixed at the second-endpoint arrival, uniqueness (dependence only on B(e,2t)) can be argued and yields an existential node\u2192edge reduction.",
    "Non-conflict is immediate in the universal formulation: both directions cannot be universally forced under the same \u03b2. Sets remain non-empty and local 'no-sink in sets' constraints are preserved.",
    "Iteration plan (LB.2): alternate node\u2194edge universal half-steps 2t times to obtain a 0-round edge-centered set-labeling; this should violate the ID-graph condition and complete the lower bound."
