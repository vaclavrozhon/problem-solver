This round develops the missing normalization and non-conflict ingredients needed to finish the localized round-elimination lower bound for Online-LOCAL(t) on bounded-degree trees. Main contributions: (1) Lemma NE (Normalization-and-Extension around an edge) formalizes that any normalized local arrival schedule inside B(e,2t) can be realized by a global schedule and that outside arrivals can be pushed past the decisive moment without affecting B(e,t). (2) A sharp “+1” minimality counterexample shows K = 2t+2W+1 is necessary for quiescent batching. (3) The node→edge elimination is reworked into a universal, set-valued step (LB.1u) that defines S_e(β) by universal quantification over normalized local schedules; non-conflict is then immediate. An alternative decisive-edge semantics (LB.1e) yields uniqueness and an existential reduction. Iterating the universal elimination 2t times gives a 0-round set-labeling that should contradict the ID-graph property (LB.2). Next steps are to formalize the symmetric edge→node half-step, finish the quantified proofs, and integrate everything into output.md. Citations: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json.
