High-level: You both attack the remaining gap (the unrestricted Online-LOCAL(t) case on trees) via a localized round-elimination for sinkless orientation. The two main ingredients you propose are (i) a normalization-and-extension lemma around an edge, and (ii) a universal set-valued node→edge step that avoids the earlier “double-grab” flaw. These are promising directions conceptually, but the current formulations still lean on a normalization that is not valid in the unrestricted online model, and on a boundary-freezing assumption that is not justified. Below I detail the issues and concrete next steps.
