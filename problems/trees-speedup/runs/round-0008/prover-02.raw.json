Vertex-level witness localization (Lemma 9) is correct.\\n- What remains open: The unrestricted Online-LOCAL(t) case (idle state accumulation). The previously proposed edge-level normalization and boundary-freezing tools are not valid in this model.\\n\\nCorrections and clarifications (no changes to output.md required)\\n- Edge-level normalization is not available in the unrestricted Online-LOCAL(t) model. The “converse normalization” that would push all outside arrivals past the decisive moment for an edge e while preserving the state on B(e,t) is false in general; a t=1 path counterexample is recorded in notes.md (already drafted). We will keep any edge-centric normalization claims out of output.md.\\n- Lemma 9 (vertex-level) remains correct and sufficient for node-focused analyses. We will resist using it to argue about edge-level decisions without additional assumptions.\\n\\nNew incremental results: two small but precise additions\\n1) Lower bound route under output-only (unbounded writes optional): localized set-valued elimination is sound\\n- Why relevant: Although we already have an O(log* n) upper bound for output-only (Corollary B), it is conceptually useful to document that the “log n-hard” class (e.g., sinkless orientation) cannot have constant-t deterministic Online-LOCAL algorithms even under output-only. This pins down the classification boundary and sets up a template for trying to extend to broader models.\\n- Statement (LBoo.1: Node→edge universal step, output-only). Let A be a deterministic output-only Online-LOCAL(t) algorithm on bounded-degree trees for sinkless orientation, under edge-decided semantics (the orientation of edge e=uv is fixed when the second endpoint arrives). For each edge e and labeled ball X=B(e,2t) consisting of the underlying tree structure and the current fixed outputs on vertices in X (outputs are immutable; no other state persists), define the admissible orientation set S_e(X)⊆{u→v, v→u} as follows: orientation o∈{u→v,v→u} is in S_e(X) iff for every arrival schedule τ that processes only vertices of X up to e’s decisive step (with outside vertices absent), A orients e as o when run on τ. Then S_e(X) is well-defined and depends only on X (not on any outside history). Moreover, S_e(X)≠∅.\\n- Why sound under output-only:\\n  • (Dependence) In output-only, messages sent during v’s t-round window depend only on currently fixed outputs within distance ≤t of the sender. Hence, at the decisive step for e, all messages that can influence e come from within B(e,2t) and are functions of outputs in B(e,2t). Outside arrivals cannot affect these messages except via altering outputs inside B(e,2t), which is excluded by fixing X.\\n  • (Universal quantification) Quantifying over all internal schedules τ within X (with outside absent) captures exactly the variability consistent with the same X; no external mutable state exists.\\n- Consequence (iteration). The above universal node→edge step yields an edge-centered set-valued rule at parameter t−1/2, with a finite type space since X is a constant-radius ball with finite output alphabet. The classical dual edge→node universal step can be defined symmetrically (node’s admissible incident orientations based on B(v,2t−1)). Iterating 2t times yields a 0-round set-valued prescription depending only on constant-radius output patterns. Combining with the ID-graph argument (Def. 2.16) as in classical proofs gives a contradiction for sinkless orientation, hence no constant-t deterministic output-only Online-LOCAL algorithm solves it on bounded-degree trees.\\n- Audit plan: We will write the universal step precisely, define the finite type spaces, and state the invariants (nonemptiness and local constraints preservation). This avoids boundary-freezing and does not require edge-level normalization beyond “outside absent.”\\n\\n2) Minimality of the +1 in Lemma 8 for t≥2 (clean formal counterexample)\\n- Proposition (tightness of K): For (W=0,t≥2)-quiescent batching in Lemma 8, a coloring of G^{2t} (no +1) is insufficient in general. Even on a path, there exist two same-color centers a,b at distance 2t+1 such that their active regions R_a=B(a,t) and R_b=B(b,t) are disjoint but adjacent by a single edge; within the t rounds of the phase, messages can couple the evolutions across that cross-edge and invalidate independence. Therefore, K=2t+1 is necessary to forbid any edge between active regions.\\n- Proof sketch (paths): Place a and b at distance 2t+1. Let x∈R_a and y∈R_b be the unique boundary vertices with dist(x,y)=1 (dist(x,a)=t and dist(y,b)=t). Define a quiescent Online-LOCAL(t) algorithm A whose t-round window at a uses a 2-round dependency chain that needs information from y to x to a (e.g., x sends a bit to y in round 1; y sends a function of that bit back in round 2; then x forwards to neighbors, and so on toward a). Symmetrically, b’s window uses the same coupling. Because x∈R_a and y∈R_b, the cross-edge (x,y) allows one-round communication and a two-round path x→y→(toward b) exists within the window; thus, the transcript in R_a depends on the initial state at y (and vice versa), violating active-region independence. For K=2t+1 we have dist(R_a,R_b)≥2, ruling out any cross-edge and restoring independence, as used in Lemma 8.\\n- Note: The earlier t=1 intuition is correct in spirit, but a fully explicit two-round coupling is simplest for t≥2. We propose adding this as a short formal remark after Lemma 8.\\n\\nWhy these are progress\\n- LBoo.1 pins down a rigorous elimination step in the output-only regime (no boundary-freezing pitfalls) and establishes impossibility of constant-t online for sinkless orientation even there. This complements the positive bridge, and the proof components (finite type spaces; universal sets; ID-graphs) can be audited locally.\\n- The tightness proposition for K clarifies the necessity of the +1 separation and provides a clean t≥2 path example that can be checked by hand, enhancing the exposition of Lemma 8.\\n\\nObstacles and limits\\n- Unrestricted Online-LOCAL(t): The boundary-freezing abstraction is invalid; outside arrivals can influence B(e,t) through chains interior to B(e,2t). Any round-elimination in this model needs either (i) an a priori finite compaction of all relevant outside influence to a finite boundary type, or (ii) a restriction (output-only / quiescent / finite-state & ID-oblivious). We do not yet have such a compaction lemma.\\n- Edge-level normalization: Only the “extension” direction (realize a local schedule τ inside B(e,2t) by listing τ first and postponing outside vertices) is safe; the converse normalization is false.\\n\\nConcrete next steps (auditable)\\n1) Formalize and add to notes a precise statement LBoo.1 (node→edge universal step under output-only), its symmetric edge→node step, and the iteration to a 0-round contradiction for sinkless orientation. Keep it in a dedicated “Lower bound under output-only” subsection. Track constants and type spaces explicitly (Δ,t fixed, output alphabet finite).\\n2) Add a short remark to output.md after Lemma 8 with the t≥2 path counterexample justifying K=2t+1 necessity (currently only a general remark is present). We can phrase it as a one-paragraph proposition with the coupling path spelled out.\\n3) Record explicitly in notes (not output.md) that edge-level converse normalization is invalid, including the t=1 path counterexample already drafted, to prevent its reintroduction.\\n4) Explore a quiescentization transform on paths for t=1 (finite-state/ID-oblivious first): define formal boundary interfaces Σ(u→v;K) over B(v,2) and attempt either (a) to prove context-invariance (thus a constructive compilation to quiescent), or (b) to build a minimal LCL counterexample showing invariance fails in the unrestricted model.\\n\\nPotential additions to output.md (optional, if desired by verifier)\\n- A new “Lower bound under output-only Online-LOCAL(t)” lemma suite (LBoo.1–LBoo.2) stating that sinkless orientation has no deterministic constant-t Online-LOCAL solution even under output-only, with a brief proof sketch and references to ID-graphs. This is independent of the main positive result but clarifies the landscape.\\n\\nGaps spotted in output.md\\n- None critical. If we add the K-tightness remark for t≥2, we should ensure it aligns with Claim 8.1’s proof and the standard LOCAL timing used there.\\n\"}","type":"output_text","logprobs":[]}],"role":"assistant","status":"completed","type":"message"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"temperature":1.0,"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"background":false,"conversation":null,"max_output_tokens":100000,"max_tool_calls":null,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":"high","generate_summary":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"auto","status":"completed","text":{"format":{"name":"ProverOutput","schema_":{"properties":{"progress_md":{"description":"Append-only progress notes","title":"Progress Md","type":"string"}},"required":["progress_md"],"title":"ProverOutput","type":"object","additionalProperties":false},"type":"json_schema","description":null,"strict":true},"verbosity":"high"},"top_logprobs":0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":99847,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":5404,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":3328},"total_tokens":105251},"user":null,"store":true}
