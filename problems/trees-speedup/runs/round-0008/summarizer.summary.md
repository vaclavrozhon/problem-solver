Round output: two complementary prover progress notes and a verifier verdict of “partial success”. Prover-01 replaces the invalid edge-normalization with an adversarial schedule-localization lemma (Lemma S), defines a node→edge universal set-valued step (LB.1u') over finite ID-graph types, proves S_e(X_e) is nonempty and satisfies a preserved “no-sink-in-sets” constraint, and outlines iterating symmetric edge→node half-steps to obtain a 0-round set prescription and reach a contradiction via the ID-graph. Prover-01 also promises an explicit t=2 path counterexample (Proposition P) to justify the +1 in Lemma 8. Prover-02 formalizes the same elimination under the output-only model (LBoo.1), concluding sinkless orientation has no constant-t deterministic Online-LOCAL solution there, and gives a t≥2 path coupling that shows K = 2t+1 is necessary. Remaining open: the unrestricted Online-LOCAL(t) case is still unresolved because idle/outside state accumulation prevents the invalid converse normalization from holding.
