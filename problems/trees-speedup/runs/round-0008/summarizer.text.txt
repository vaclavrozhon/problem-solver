  "summary_md": "Round output: two complementary prover progress notes and a verifier verdict of “partial success”. Prover-01 replaces the invalid edge-normalization with an adversarial schedule-localization lemma (Lemma S), defines a node→edge universal set-valued step (LB.1u') over finite ID-graph types, proves S_e(X_e) is nonempty and satisfies a preserved “no-sink-in-sets” constraint, and outlines iterating symmetric edge→node half-steps to obtain a 0-round set prescription and reach a contradiction via the ID-graph. Prover-01 also promises an explicit t=2 path counterexample (Proposition P) to justify the +1 in Lemma 8. Prover-02 formalizes the same elimination under the output-only model (LBoo.1), concluding sinkless orientation has no constant-t deterministic Online-LOCAL solution there, and gives a t≥2 path coupling that shows K = 2t+1 is necessary. Remaining open: the unrestricted Online-LOCAL(t) case is still unresolved because idle/outside state accumulation prevents the invalid converse normalization from holding. Sources: prover-01.out.json, prover-02.out.json.",
  "highlights": [
    "Lemma S (schedule-localization): an adversary can schedule all vertices of B(e,2t) before any outside vertex, so edge e’s decision (edge-decided semantics) depends only on the internal arrival order inside B(e,2t).",
    "Node→edge universal set step (LB.1u'): define X_e as the radius-2t ID-graph labeled ball and S_e(X_e) = {out_A(X_e, τ) : τ in Ord(X_e)}. Each S_e(X_e) is nonempty, depends only on X_e, and the ID-graph framework makes the type space finite.",
    "No-sink-in-sets invariant: for every node w at least one incident S_e contains an outward orientation; proved by adversarially ordering the union of incident 2t-balls so all those edges become decidable with the outside absent.",
    "Iteration plan: define the symmetric edge→node half-step on radius-(2t−1) balls, preserve nonemptiness and the no-sink-in-sets constraint through 2t half-steps, and derive a 0-round set-valued prescription that contradicts ID-graph combinatorics (to be ported from Theorem 2.15).",
    "Output-only elimination (LBoo.1): under output-only semantics (immutable outputs), the same universal elimination works and yields an impossibility of constant-t deterministic Online-LOCAL solutions for sinkless orientation; finite type spaces follow from constant-radius output patterns.",
    "Tightness / counterexamples: an explicit path coupling shows the +1 in separation (K = 2t+1) is necessary (Prover-01 promises a t=2 construction; Prover-02 gives a t≥2 path-coupling argument). The converse of earlier edge-normalization is invalid, leaving unrestricted Online-LOCAL(t) still open."

  "next_questions": [
    "Formalize and add Lemma S and LB.1u' to the draft (output.md): include full proofs, the exact definition of the finite type catalogue (rooted, port-colored ID-graph balls of radius 2t), and the argument that S_e is well-defined and nonempty.",
    "Formalize the symmetric edge→node half-step (radius drop tracking), prove preservation of nonemptiness and the no-sink-in-sets invariant, then iterate 2t half-steps and adapt the ID-graph contradiction (Theorem 2.15) to the set-valued context to complete the lower-bound route.",
    "Write the explicit tightness constructions: (a) the t=2 path algorithm and 2-round relay for Proposition P (justifying the +1 in Lemma 8), and (b) the t≥2 path-coupling example showing K = 2t+1 is necessary; optionally, finalize LBoo.1 text and place it in a dedicated \"Lower bound under output-only\" subsection."
