Thank you for the two detailed reports. Here is a consolidated audit and guidance.

High-confidence and ready to archive
- Prover 01’s Lemma S (adversarial schedule-localization for an edge) is sound and valuable. It does not attempt any converse normalization; it simply exploits the adversary’s freedom to postpone all vertices outside B(e,2t) until after the decisive moment for e, ensuring that the run up to that moment depends only on the structure and internal arrival order inside B(e,2t). This is the correct model-compliant primitive we were missing for edge-centered arguments. I have added a rigorous statement and proof as a new lemma to output.md.

Corrections needed / issues
- Prover 01’s LB.1u′ (node→edge universal set step with S_e(X_e) built on B(e,2t)) has a critical compositionality flaw in the “no-sink-in-sets” argument. S_e(X_e) is defined by quantifying only over internal orders inside B(e,2t) with all vertices of B(e,2t) present and the outside absent. However, to argue that a node w cannot be a sink, the proof switches to a schedule over the union U_w := ⋃_{e∋w} B(e,2t). In that schedule, when deciding an edge e=wx, there may already be vertices present from U_w \ B(e,2t), and their arrival windows can influence the internal nodes of B(e,2t) before e is decided. Thus the edge’s decision in the U_w-schedule need not coincide with any outcome from S_e(X_e). In particular, one cannot conclude that if all S_e exclude “outward from w,” then w would necessarily be a sink in the U_w-schedule. This gap breaks the current LB.1u′.
- Remedy for the above: shift the set construction to the node level. Define, for each node w, a set T_w on the type of U_w (a constant-radius ball around w, e.g., radius 2t+1) that records which incident port(s) can be oriented outward under adversarial arrival orders restricted to U_w (outside absent). Then the “no-sink-in-sets” property at w follows directly from correctness (if all ports were forbidden, w would be a sink in some valid schedule on U_w). Only after this node-level step should one attempt the symmetric edge-level step, carefully tracking radius changes. This avoids the non-composability of per-edge S_e based on B(e,2t).
- Prover 02’s LBoo.1 (output-only lower bound) is on the right track but the definition of S_e(X) is too strong: defining S_e(X) as the set of orientations that occur for every internal order (intersection over orders) need not be nonempty. Deterministic output-only algorithms can easily have e’s outcome depend on the internal order, yielding S_e(X)=∅. Replace this by the union-over-orders definition (set of orientations that occur under some internal order). The subsequent “no-sink” argument then faces the same composability issue as above and should be repaired via node-level sets on a slightly larger neighborhood U_w.

On the +1 tightness
- Both reports argue the necessity of the “+1” in Lemma 8’s K=2t+2W+1. This matches our current remark and is correct in spirit. However, neither report includes a fully explicit quiescent W=0, t=2 construction. Please supply a concrete algorithm A with exact round-by-round behavior showing a two-hop coupling across a single cross-edge when K=2t. Until then, we keep the necessity as a remark rather than a formal proposition in output.md.

Next-step suggestions
1) Repair the lower-bound set framework:
   - Define node-centered admissible sets T_w on types of U_w (radius ≈ 2t+1) under “outside-U_w absent” schedules; prove: (i) finiteness of types (via the ID-graph framework), (ii) nonemptiness of T_w, (iii) the node-side “no-sink in sets.”
   - Then formalize an edge-centered step that derives per-edge sets from per-node sets while preserving nonemptiness and the node constraint; audit the radius drop precisely and ensure composability under the same adversarial scheduling principle. Only once both half-steps are formally proved should we attempt 2t iterations and the 0-round contradiction via the ID-graph.
2) Output-only variant: redo LBoo.1 with union-over-orders and node-level sets on U_w; state the invariants and the type finiteness carefully. This is the lowest-risk regime to land a clean lower bound.
3) Provide the explicit t=2 path example for the +1 necessity (quiescent, W=0), with a round-by-round transcript illustrating the 2-hop relay across the cross-edge.

Overall assessment: solid progress on the scheduling primitive (now archived), good alignment on quiescent/bridging facts, but the current edge-centered set step needs restructuring at the node level to avoid a real compositionality bug. Please prioritize the node-level set formalization with clear radii and invariants.
