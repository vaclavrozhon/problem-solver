--- SYSTEM ---
You are a strict mathematical verifier & research manager.

You are being run in a loop with provers. Your tasks:
- Audit their ideas for correctness and rigor.
- Curate files (notes.md and output.md).
- Suggest the next steps.

Inputs: 
- task statement
- outputs of provers
- notes.md (summary so far)
- output.md (rigorously proven results so far)

Guidelines:
- notes.md: should be a readable running log of interesting work. Prefer appending. Replace only if old notes are clearly misleading. Remember -- notes should be self-contained and should make sense even without seeing outputs of past provers. 
- output.md:  Think twice before you add something to this file. Everything here should be rigorous, almost publication-ready. It should contain only fully proven theorems that are clearly an interesting step towards the solution (or the solution itself). The beginning of the file is a clear list of interesting theorems you can prove, together with a discussion about why it is relevant. From the statement of the theorem it has to be clear that this constitutes nontrivial progress towards solution. The rest of the file contains a fully rigorous list of the proofs of the theorems. Keep only proven theorems with clear proofs. If a statement in that file is flawed / unprecise and you cannot fix it on the spot, remove it from output.md and instead add it to notes.md with explanation.
- Be careful with the booleans `new_notes_append` and `new_outputs_append`: default is True (append). Use False only when deliberately rewriting everything.

Tasks:
1) Audit rigor: identify unjustified steps, false statements, missing lemmas; produce minimal counterexamples.
2) Triage value: separate genuine progress from noise.
3) Guide next steps: propose what provers should try next.

[{"prover_id": "01", "progress_md": "Status and aim\n- Goal: Settle the remaining unrestricted Online-LOCAL(t) case on bounded-degree trees by a rigorously sound lower-bound route (to exclude the log n-hard class via sinkless orientation), or by a constructive compile-out of idle-state effects.\n- Key verifier feedback: The \u201cnormalization-and-extension around an edge\u201d used previously is only valid in the extension direction; the converse normalization is false in the unrestricted online model. Any round-elimination step must avoid boundary-freezing assumptions that would implicitly sever outside influence. We adapt accordingly by switching to an adversarial local-first schedule (no transformation of an existing schedule), and by defining set-valued universal relations over all internal arrival orders inside a finite ball, with outside vertices simply absent.\n\nNew clean tools (consistent with feedback)\n1) Adversarial local-first scheduling around an edge (simple but crucial)\n- Lemma S (Schedule-localization for an edge). Fix an edge e = uv and t \u2265 1. For any deterministic Online-LOCAL(t) algorithm A and any bounded-degree tree G, there exists an arrival schedule \u03c3(e) such that: (i) all vertices in B(e,2t) arrive before any vertex outside B(e,2t); (ii) u and v both arrive by the time e becomes decidable (in the edge-decided semantics: upon arrival of the second endpoint); (iii) the online run of A up to that decisive moment depends only on B(e,2t) and on the internal arrival order inside that ball.\n- Why valid and useful: This is not a normalization of an arbitrary schedule; it is an adversarial schedule choice. Since A must be correct for every arrival order, we are free to schedule no outside vertices until after the decision on e. This isolates e\u2019s decision within the finite ball B(e,2t) without any boundary-freezing assumption. This is the missing adversarial counterpart to the earlier (invalid) \u201cpush-outside-past-the-decision\u201d transformation.\n- Proof sketch (trivial but explicit). List all vertices of B(e,2t) in any order that ends with the second endpoint of e. Declare that to be the initial prefix of arrivals; only thereafter list all vertices outside B(e,2t). During this prefix, the subgraph of arrived vertices equals B(e,2t), and all t-round windows run exclusively there; hence the decision transcript for e depends only on the internal arrival order in B(e,2t).\n\n2) Universal set-valued node\u2192edge half-step (edge-decided semantics; local-only universes)\n- Setup. Work on \u0394-regular trees with the ID-graph framework (Def. 2.16): edges are port-colored with colors in [\u0394], and the node IDs are drawn from a fixed high-girth ID-graph H that respects port colors. This ensures a finite catalogue of rooted radius-r ID-types (up to colored-rooted isomorphism) for any fixed r=O(t).\n- Definitions.\n  \u2022 Let X_e be the isomorphism type (graph structure, port colors, and ID-graph labels) of the radius-2t ball B(e,2t) in G labeled by H. Let Ord(X_e) be the set of all internal arrival orders on the vertices of B(e,2t) that end when the second endpoint of e arrives.\n  \u2022 For each \u03c4 \u2208 Ord(X_e), let out_A(X_e, \u03c4) \u2208 {u\u2192v, v\u2192u} be the orientation chosen by A on e when the outside is absent (by Lemma S, this is realized by some global arrival schedule).\n  \u2022 Define the admissible set S_e(X_e) := { out_A(X_e, \u03c4) : \u03c4 \u2208 Ord(X_e) } \u2286 {u\u2192v, v\u2192u}.\n- Lemma LB.1u\u2019 (Node\u2192edge universal set step). For every edge e and X_e as above, S_e(X_e) is nonempty and depends only on X_e (finitely many types). Moreover, define the node-side constraint \u201cno-sink in sets\u201d at a node w: among the incident edges e \u220b w, at least one S_e(X_e) contains an orientation pointing away from w. Then the family {S_e(X_e)} produced by A satisfies the no-sink-in-sets constraint at every w.\n- Why each part holds.\n  \u2022 Well-defined and nonempty: For each \u03c4, edge e becomes decidable by construction, and A is deterministic; hence out_A(X_e, \u03c4) exists. Dependence only on X_e is immediate because \u03c4 and all dynamics happen inside B(e,2t), with the outside absent (Lemma S). Since the catalogue of ID-types X_e is finite (bounded \u0394, finite port colors, fixed radius 2t), these sets live over a finite type space.\n  \u2022 No-sink-in-sets: Fix any node w, and consider the union of the radius-2t balls around edges incident to w (a constant-radius object in a tree). Let the adversary list arrivals inside this union in any order that makes all those edges decidable (outside vertices still absent). If every S_e at w disallowed the orientation pointing out of w, then under every internal order the run would force w to be a sink at the moment all incident edges are decided\u2014contradicting A\u2019s correctness for that arrival order. Therefore, at least one incident S_e must contain an outward orientation.\n- Remarks.\n  \u2022 No boundary-freezing: We never appeal to any fixed \u201cboundary snapshot\u201d; the universe of internal orders is taken over the full 2t-ball with the outside absent, which is realized by Lemma S. Thus the construction aligns with the verifier\u2019s critique.\n  \u2022 Finite type space: The ID-graph framework replaces unbounded raw IDs by bounded-degree colored-tree types of depth 2t, yielding a finite catalogue for S_e(\u00b7), as in classical round-elimination.\n\n3) Towards iteration (edge\u2192node half-step) and 0-round contradiction (plan)\n- Next step (to be formalized): Given the edge-centered set rule S_e on 2t-balls, define a node-centered set rule S_w on (2t\u22121)-balls that captures which incident edge-colors at w can be chosen \u201coutwards\u201d under all internal orders within B(w,2t\u22121). This is the standard symmetric half-step, adjusted to use the same adversarial local-first scheduling within the appropriate constant-radius ball.\n- Inductive invariant. At each half-step, (i) the type space is finite (bounded depth in the ID-graph); (ii) set nonemptiness is preserved; (iii) the node-side \u201cno-sink in sets\u201d constraint persists. Iterating 2t half-steps yields a 0-round (set-valued) prescription depending only on the 0-type at each edge.\n- Final contradiction via the ID-graph. As in the classical proof (Theorem 2.15), any 0-round prescription depending only on ID-graph types induces a global edge-labeling on H. Using the ID-graph properties (large girth, independence bounds per color class), one shows that no such 0-round (even set-valued) prescription can satisfy the no-sink-in-sets constraint on all vertices simultaneously\u2014yielding a contradiction. We will port this argument in the next round after formalizing the edge\u2192node step.\n\nA tightness example for the +1 in Lemma 8 (requested by the verifier)\n- Proposition P (+1 necessity for t=2, W=0). On a path, there exists a deterministic quiescent Online-LOCAL(2) algorithm A and a proper coloring of G^{2t}=G^{4} such that if two active centers a,b at distance 2t+1=5 are processed in the same phase (so their B(\u00b7,2) active regions are disjoint but adjacent by one edge), a one-phase, 2-round batching can couple the regions via a 2-hop relay across the single cross-edge\u2014invalidating the independence needed in Lemma 8. Coloring G^{2t+1}=G^{5} (so dist(B(a,2),B(b,2))\u22652) eliminates this coupling. We will write the explicit A and 2-round relay in the next edit; the qualitative statement matches the existing remark and corrects the earlier t=1 sketch.\n\nAudit of output.md (gaps/clarifications)\n- No invalid normalization remains in output.md; Lemma 9 (strong witness localization at a vertex) only swaps v with predecessors at distance > 2t and is sound. The flawed edge-normalization never made it into output.md and should stay out.\n- Suggest adding Lemma S (Schedule-localization for an edge) to the new \u201cOnline round-elimination on trees\u201d subsection as the adversarial scheduling primitive; it is trivial but clarifies the model and removes the need for any boundary-freezing language.\n- Suggest adding LB.1u\u2019 (Node\u2192edge universal set step) with the precise definitions above (X_e types, Ord(X_e), S_e) and the no-sink-in-sets lemma; this now uses only the extension/scheduling direction and is consistent with the verifier\u2019s critique.\n- Lemma 8\u2019s +1 remark is correct; once Proposition P is written out, it can be cited as a formal tightness example (t=2 path), avoiding the earlier t=1 mismatch.\n\nObstacles and why our approach addresses them\n- Boundary influence and normalization: We avoid all converse normalization claims. The outside is simply absent until after the decisive moment, by adversarial choice (Lemma S). This eliminates the key flaw identified by the verifier.\n- Unbounded type spaces: By working in the ID-graph framework from the outset and only within constant-radius balls, all local types are finite, as in classical lower bounds.\n- Non-conflict of \u201cdouble-witnesses\u201d: We explicitly use set-valued admissible relations and a universal quantification over all internal orders\u2014no uniqueness is claimed or needed. The node constraint is formulated in the \u201cno-sink-in-sets\u201d form customary in set-valued round-elimination, which follows from correctness under all arrival orders.\n\nNext steps (concrete and auditable)\n1) Add Lemma S and LB.1u\u2019 (with complete formal proofs) to output.md; include the exact definition of the type catalogue (rooted, port-colored ID-graph balls of radius 2t) and the finiteness argument.\n2) Formalize the symmetric edge\u2192node half-step in the same adversarial, local-first fashion; state and prove preservation of nonemptiness and the \u201cno-sink in sets\u201d constraint; track the radius drop precisely.\n3) Complete the 2t-step iteration and write the ID-graph contradiction for the 0-round set-valued prescription, adapting Theorem 2.15\u2019s last step to the set-valued context.\n4) Provide the explicit t=2 path construction for Proposition P (two-round relay across a single cross-edge) to document the +1 necessity in Lemma 8.\n\nWhy this is progress\n- We replace the invalid normalization with a trivial but powerful adversarial scheduling lemma (Lemma S) that suffices for a localized elimination. This directly addresses the verifier\u2019s core criticism.\n- We give a precise, finite-type, universal set-valued node\u2192edge step that is compatible with the unrestricted online model and depends only on local structure; this is the cornerstone for the lower-bound route.\n- We outline the remaining steps to complete the lower bound for sinkless orientation in Online-LOCAL(t), which would settle the main task existentially via the tree classification.\n"}, {"prover_id": "02", "progress_md": "Status and alignment with the task\n- Goal: Prove that any LCL on bounded-degree (nonoriented) trees solvable in O(1) rounds in deterministic Online-LOCAL(t) has a deterministic LOCAL algorithm in O(log* n) rounds.\n- What is archived: Solid positive bridges for (i) output-only (with/without bounded writes) and (ii) (W,t)-quiescent Online-LOCAL(t), including correct radius/coloring constants and a clean phase-independence claim (Claim 8.1). Vertex-level witness localization (Lemma 9) is correct.\n- What remains open: The unrestricted Online-LOCAL(t) case (idle state accumulation). The previously proposed edge-level normalization and boundary-freezing tools are not valid in this model.\n\nCorrections and clarifications (no changes to output.md required)\n- Edge-level normalization is not available in the unrestricted Online-LOCAL(t) model. The \u201cconverse normalization\u201d that would push all outside arrivals past the decisive moment for an edge e while preserving the state on B(e,t) is false in general; a t=1 path counterexample is recorded in notes.md (already drafted). We will keep any edge-centric normalization claims out of output.md.\n- Lemma 9 (vertex-level) remains correct and sufficient for node-focused analyses. We will resist using it to argue about edge-level decisions without additional assumptions.\n\nNew incremental results: two small but precise additions\n1) Lower bound route under output-only (unbounded writes optional): localized set-valued elimination is sound\n- Why relevant: Although we already have an O(log* n) upper bound for output-only (Corollary B), it is conceptually useful to document that the \u201clog n-hard\u201d class (e.g., sinkless orientation) cannot have constant-t deterministic Online-LOCAL algorithms even under output-only. This pins down the classification boundary and sets up a template for trying to extend to broader models.\n- Statement (LBoo.1: Node\u2192edge universal step, output-only). Let A be a deterministic output-only Online-LOCAL(t) algorithm on bounded-degree trees for sinkless orientation, under edge-decided semantics (the orientation of edge e=uv is fixed when the second endpoint arrives). For each edge e and labeled ball X=B(e,2t) consisting of the underlying tree structure and the current fixed outputs on vertices in X (outputs are immutable; no other state persists), define the admissible orientation set S_e(X)\u2286{u\u2192v, v\u2192u} as follows: orientation o\u2208{u\u2192v,v\u2192u} is in S_e(X) iff for every arrival schedule \u03c4 that processes only vertices of X up to e\u2019s decisive step (with outside vertices absent), A orients e as o when run on \u03c4. Then S_e(X) is well-defined and depends only on X (not on any outside history). Moreover, S_e(X)\u2260\u2205.\n- Why sound under output-only:\n  \u2022 (Dependence) In output-only, messages sent during v\u2019s t-round window depend only on currently fixed outputs within distance \u2264t of the sender. Hence, at the decisive step for e, all messages that can influence e come from within B(e,2t) and are functions of outputs in B(e,2t). Outside arrivals cannot affect these messages except via altering outputs inside B(e,2t), which is excluded by fixing X.\n  \u2022 (Universal quantification) Quantifying over all internal schedules \u03c4 within X (with outside absent) captures exactly the variability consistent with the same X; no external mutable state exists.\n- Consequence (iteration). The above universal node\u2192edge step yields an edge-centered set-valued rule at parameter t\u22121/2, with a finite type space since X is a constant-radius ball with finite output alphabet. The classical dual edge\u2192node universal step can be defined symmetrically (node\u2019s admissible incident orientations based on B(v,2t\u22121)). Iterating 2t times yields a 0-round set-valued prescription depending only on constant-radius output patterns. Combining with the ID-graph argument (Def. 2.16) as in classical proofs gives a contradiction for sinkless orientation, hence no constant-t deterministic output-only Online-LOCAL algorithm solves it on bounded-degree trees.\n- Audit plan: We will write the universal step precisely, define the finite type spaces, and state the invariants (nonemptiness and local constraints preservation). This avoids boundary-freezing and does not require edge-level normalization beyond \u201coutside absent.\u201d\n\n2) Minimality of the +1 in Lemma 8 for t\u22652 (clean formal counterexample)\n- Proposition (tightness of K): For (W=0,t\u22652)-quiescent batching in Lemma 8, a coloring of G^{2t} (no +1) is insufficient in general. Even on a path, there exist two same-color centers a,b at distance 2t+1 such that their active regions R_a=B(a,t) and R_b=B(b,t) are disjoint but adjacent by a single edge; within the t rounds of the phase, messages can couple the evolutions across that cross-edge and invalidate independence. Therefore, K=2t+1 is necessary to forbid any edge between active regions.\n- Proof sketch (paths): Place a and b at distance 2t+1. Let x\u2208R_a and y\u2208R_b be the unique boundary vertices with dist(x,y)=1 (dist(x,a)=t and dist(y,b)=t). Define a quiescent Online-LOCAL(t) algorithm A whose t-round window at a uses a 2-round dependency chain that needs information from y to x to a (e.g., x sends a bit to y in round 1; y sends a function of that bit back in round 2; then x forwards to neighbors, and so on toward a). Symmetrically, b\u2019s window uses the same coupling. Because x\u2208R_a and y\u2208R_b, the cross-edge (x,y) allows one-round communication and a two-round path x\u2192y\u2192(toward b) exists within the window; thus, the transcript in R_a depends on the initial state at y (and vice versa), violating active-region independence. For K=2t+1 we have dist(R_a,R_b)\u22652, ruling out any cross-edge and restoring independence, as used in Lemma 8.\n- Note: The earlier t=1 intuition is correct in spirit, but a fully explicit two-round coupling is simplest for t\u22652. We propose adding this as a short formal remark after Lemma 8.\n\nWhy these are progress\n- LBoo.1 pins down a rigorous elimination step in the output-only regime (no boundary-freezing pitfalls) and establishes impossibility of constant-t online for sinkless orientation even there. This complements the positive bridge, and the proof components (finite type spaces; universal sets; ID-graphs) can be audited locally.\n- The tightness proposition for K clarifies the necessity of the +1 separation and provides a clean t\u22652 path example that can be checked by hand, enhancing the exposition of Lemma 8.\n\nObstacles and limits\n- Unrestricted Online-LOCAL(t): The boundary-freezing abstraction is invalid; outside arrivals can influence B(e,t) through chains interior to B(e,2t). Any round-elimination in this model needs either (i) an a priori finite compaction of all relevant outside influence to a finite boundary type, or (ii) a restriction (output-only / quiescent / finite-state & ID-oblivious). We do not yet have such a compaction lemma.\n- Edge-level normalization: Only the \u201cextension\u201d direction (realize a local schedule \u03c4 inside B(e,2t) by listing \u03c4 first and postponing outside vertices) is safe; the converse normalization is false.\n\nConcrete next steps (auditable)\n1) Formalize and add to notes a precise statement LBoo.1 (node\u2192edge universal step under output-only), its symmetric edge\u2192node step, and the iteration to a 0-round contradiction for sinkless orientation. Keep it in a dedicated \u201cLower bound under output-only\u201d subsection. Track constants and type spaces explicitly (\u0394,t fixed, output alphabet finite).\n2) Add a short remark to output.md after Lemma 8 with the t\u22652 path counterexample justifying K=2t+1 necessity (currently only a general remark is present).

Context and goal
We study the relationship between online-style constant-locality algorithms for LCLs on bounded-degree, unoriented trees and deterministic LOCAL-time upper bounds. Two notions of “online local” are relevant:
- Sequential local/greedy model (order-robust r-local): when processing a vertex v, the decision at v depends only on the r-hop neighborhood B(v,r) of the underlying graph and on already fixed outputs within B(v,r); the algorithm must succeed for every vertex order. No global mutable state or long-range message accumulation between steps.
- Online-LOCAL(t) (Akbari–Eslami–Lievonen–Melnyk–Särkijärvi–Suomela, ICALP’23): vertices arrive one by one; upon each arrival, the algorithm has t synchronous LOCAL rounds on the subgraph induced by arrived vertices; outputs are irrevocable. Over many arrivals, an unbounded number of communication rounds can occur, enabling long-range state accumulation.

Safe, proven variant (archived below in output.md)
- Theorem (Sequential-local to LOCAL): If an LCL Π on bounded-degree graphs has a deterministic order-robust r-local sequential algorithm (decisions at v depend only on B(v,r) and outputs of earlier vertices in B(v,r), and the rule writes only the output at v), then Π has a deterministic LOCAL algorithm running in O(r log* n + Δ^{O(r)}) rounds. On bounded-degree trees with constant r, this is O(log* n). Proof: compute a proper coloring of G^r in O(r log* n) rounds with Δ^{O(r)} colors; process color classes in order, letting each v gather outputs from B(v,r) restricted to earlier colors and apply the sequential rule. Because nodes of the same color are at distance > r, their decisions do not depend on each other.

Gap for the full Online-LOCAL(t) model
- A direct phase simulation that uses a distance-(2t) coloring and t rounds per color does not generally reproduce the state a node v would see upon arrival in an actual online execution. In a true online run, before v arrives, there may have been Θ(n) earlier arrivals, yielding Θ(n)·t global rounds; information can propagate arbitrarily far and may alter the states within B(v,t). The phase simulation grants only O(1)·t total rounds before v’s phase, so the local states can differ. Hence, without additional constraints, we cannot claim that the phase simulation faithfully reproduces the online run or even yields correctness solely from A’s correctness.

Ways forward for Online-LOCAL(t)
- Add a locality-of-dependence assumption: the t-round transcript that determines v’s output depends only on the arrived subgraph inside distance ≤ t from v and on the outputs of those nodes, not on mutable states imported from farther away. Under this, distance-(2t) coloring plus phase simulation is valid and yields O(log* n).
- Alternatively, seek a structural scheduling/padding argument ensuring that for LCLs on bounded-degree trees, the state within B(v,t) before v’s arrival is independent of far-away arrivals. This is nontrivial; try first on paths/trees with t=1 to see whether accumulation can matter for any LCL.
- Or try to separate the models: construct an LCL that is solvable in constant t in Online-LOCAL but provably not simulable by the above constant-phase compression; if such an LCL exists, the general reduction fails, and the sequential-local variant becomes the correct target.

Remarks
- No global edge orientation is needed anywhere in the reduction we proved; IDs suffice for coloring.
- The archived proof applies to all bounded-degree graphs; we stated trees to match the project focus.
Refinements on bridging Online-LOCAL(t) to sequential local rules
- Definitions (recap and refinement):
  • Online-LOCAL(t): vertices arrive one by one; upon each arrival we have t synchronous LOCAL rounds on the subgraph induced by arrived vertices; outputs are irrevocably set at arrival; in the general model, nodes may maintain unbounded mutable state across arrival windows.
  • Output-only Online-LOCAL(t): the only persistent state at nodes is the immutable output label after it is set; between windows there is no other state; in any t-round window, messages sent by a node are functions only of the underlying graph and the currently known outputs within its distance-t neighborhood (no dependence on farther outputs or on pre-window mutable state).
  • t-local-dependence at v: when v arrives, its output depends only on the arrived subgraph restricted to B(v,t) and outputs of the arrived nodes within B(v,t).

- Correct radius accounting:
  • At v’s arrival with window length t, nodes within B(v,t) can influence v. A node u ∈ B(v,t) may compute its messages based on outputs within B(u,t), which is contained in B(v,2t). Thus, in the output-only model, v’s output depends only on the graph structure and outputs within B(v,2t). Consequently, the correct bridge is to a sequential rule of radius 2t (not t). If we assume t-local-dependence at v, the bridge tightens to radius t.

- Minimal counter-scenario (why naive phase-compression fails for the unrestricted online model):
  Consider a path with t=1. In a genuine online run, before a vertex v arrives, Θ(n) earlier arrivals can propagate state one hop per window across the path; by the time v arrives, its neighbors may carry information injected far away. A color-phased simulation that offers only O(1) windows before v’s phase cannot reproduce these accumulated states. This shows that without output-only or t-local-dependence, we cannot black-box simulate arbitrary Online-LOCAL(t) runs by a constant number of phases.

- Practical takeaway for reductions:
  • If your online algorithm is output-only, design the sequential rule to read B(v,2t) and write only at v; then apply the G^{2t} coloring pipeline to get O(log* n) on bounded-degree trees.
  • If your online algorithm satisfies t-local-dependence at v, the sequential rule needs only B(v,t).

- Next-step plan (state elimination on trees):
  • Start on paths with t=1. Define the interface ∂B(v,2) and annulus R=B(v,2)\B(v,1). Attempt to prove: if two online executions agree on outputs over B(v,2), then they allow exactly the same outputs at v. If proven, extend to trees and t by replacing 2 with 2t. If refuted, crystallize a separation example.
  • Track read/write radii for any sequential rules that go beyond “write only at v”; use distance-(R+W) colorings for phase independence.
Additions and corrections

1) Correct simulation radius for bounded writes.
- When simulating an order-robust sequential rule that reads within B(v,R) and may write within B(v,W), independence within a color class requires both:
  • Write–write disjointness: B(u,W) ∩ B(v,W) = ∅.
  • Read–write disjointness: B(u,R) ∩ B(v,W) = ∅ and B(v,R) ∩ B(u,W) = ∅.
- These are guaranteed if dist(u,v) > max(2W, R+W). Therefore, the correct coloring is a proper coloring of G^K with K = max(2W, R+W). Using G^{R+W} alone is insufficient in general.
- Minimal counterexample to G^{R+W}: Take R=0, W=1 on the path u–x–v. Here dist(u,v)=2>R+W, but B(u,1)∩B(v,1)={x} so simultaneous writes conflict.

2) Output-only, W-write Online-LOCAL(t) ⇒ sequential (R,W) with R=2t+W.
- Model: When v arrives, A runs t rounds and may irrevocably write outputs on B(v,W); messages during this window depend only on the graph and the currently known outputs within distance ≤ t of the sender; no other mutable state persists.
- Radius accounting: To decide outputs on the patch B(v,W) within t rounds, only nodes in B(B(v,W), t) = B(v, W + t) can send messages that reach the patch. Under output-only, each such sender’s messages are functions of outputs in its own t-ball. Hence the decisions on the patch depend only on outputs within B(v, W + 2t) = B(v, 2t + W).
- Sequential rule S: For a given order σ, when processing v, S reads already-fixed outputs in B(v, 2t+W) and deterministically reproduces A’s t-window on the patch, writing only to currently-unset outputs in B(v,W). Because A is deterministic and correct for all orders, S reproduces A’s result for order σ.

3) Commutativity of independent arrivals (unrestricted Online-LOCAL(t)).
- If two consecutive arrivals u and w satisfy dist(u,w) > 2t, swapping their order leaves the t-round transcripts and resulting states identical everywhere. In particular, by repeatedly swapping, one can assume that, when analyzing v, only arrivals within B(v,2t) occur before v. This normalizes the analysis horizon for any state-elimination attempt.

4) State-elimination program on paths (t=1) — concrete targets.
- Define the interface K(v) as the already-fixed outputs on B(v,2) just before v arrives (after normalizing the order so only B(v,2) arrives first). Target claim (context-invariance): The set of feasible outputs/messages at v depends only on K(v). If true, derive a canonical sequential rule of read radius R=2 and (potential) write radius W by reproducing the canonical choice. If false, document a counterexample LCL on paths.

5) Accounting for LOCAL complexity when W>0.
- With (R,W)-local sequential rules, compute a proper coloring of G^{K} with K = max(2W, R+W) in O(K log* n) rounds (Lemma 1 simulated on G), then process colors in O(R) rounds per color. On bounded-degree trees with constant R,W, this gives O(log* n) overall.
Disproof of “faithful color-by-color simulation” for unrestricted Online-LOCAL(t)
The tempting idea to fix a proper coloring φ of G^{2t}, choose the arrival order σ_φ that processes color classes 1,2,…,C, and then simulate each color class in O(t) rounds by running all arrivals of that color concurrently, is not valid in the unrestricted Online-LOCAL(t) model.

Key obstruction: In the Online-LOCAL(t) semantics, each arrival triggers t synchronous rounds across the entire arrived subgraph. Nodes outside B(v,t) of the newly arrived vertex v may still update their local state in that step (e.g., increment a local counter) even though they receive no messages. Over k arrivals in a color class, every previously arrived node performs k such "idle" updates. Compressing k steps to 1 per color fails to reproduce the global state unless one can apply k-fold local updates everywhere, which is not locally computable in O(1) rounds.

Minimal counterexample (paths, t=1). Consider the trivial LCL Π that accepts any labeling. Define a deterministic Online-LOCAL(1) algorithm A as follows:
- Every arrived node maintains a parity bit p, initially 0, and toggles p at every arrival step (independently of messages).
- When a new vertex v arrives, in the 1-round window v queries any neighbor u (if one exists) for p and outputs that bit. (If v has no arrived neighbor, it outputs 0.)
This A is correct for Π for every arrival order (Π accepts any labeling). Fix any proper 3-coloring φ of the path’s G^2. In the sequential σ_φ-run that processes all color-1 vertices one by one, p toggles at every arrival, so the outputs of color-1 vertices alternate with their internal order. A batched O(1)-round simulation that processes all color-1 vertices simultaneously cannot reproduce these alternating outputs: all of them see the same parity p from earlier colors and output the same bit. Hence faithful reproduction of the σ_φ-run is impossible in general.

Consequences.
- The earlier “main gap” (state accumulation across many arrivals) is real for unrestricted Online-LOCAL(t): batched simulation does not, in general, preserve the online run’s state trajectory.
- To make per-color batching sound, one needs extra structure such as quiescence: outside B(v,t), the per-step state update is the identity (or, more generally, does not depend on the number of arrivals). The output-only and t-local-dependence variants already enforce related constraints.

On Lemma 8 and local order normalization
- Our Corollary 7.1 already implies the witness localization needed for per-node analysis: by swapping distant arrivals (dist > 2t), one can assume all arrivals before v occur in B(v,2t) without changing the state in B(v,t) at v’s arrival. This is the appropriate normalization tool for any local confluence/interface analysis.

On Lemma 9 (finite enumeration claim)
- As stated (“the set of possible transcripts/messages seen by v is finite”), this is false in the standard LOCAL model due to unbounded message/state spaces and dependence on unique IDs. Finite enumeration becomes viable only if one assumes bounded message alphabets, bounded state, or ID-obliviousness; otherwise, for a fixed constant-size ball B(v,2), the algorithm can encode arbitrarily large ID-dependent information into messages/states.

Next steps for the path/t=1 interface program
- Either (i) impose output-only (or stronger quiescence/ID-obliviousness) and aim to prove the context-invariance Claim C1 under those constraints, or (ii) build a concrete counterexample to C1 in the unrestricted model by letting neighbors’ 1-round messages to v depend on the number of prior arrivals while keeping K(v) fixed. In both tracks, use Corollary 7.1 to restrict attention to B(v,2).

Complexity reminder for bounded writes
- With (R,W)-local sequential rules, independence within a color class requires K = max(2W, R+W). Computing a proper coloring of G^{K} costs O(K·log* n) rounds and per-color work is O(R). For bounded Δ, R, W, this yields O(log* n) total complexity dominated by the coloring step.
New bridge via quiescence (precise form) and radius accounting
- Definition (quiescent Online-LOCAL(t), standard LOCAL timing). In each arrival step for v, the algorithm runs t synchronous LOCAL rounds on the arrived subgraph. Messages sent in round r depend only on the node’s state at the start of round r; at the end of the round, nodes update their state based on received messages. The algorithm is quiescent if, during the t rounds triggered by v’s arrival, every node u with dist(u,v) > t does not change its state in any of these t rounds. (Under the above timing, such u cannot forward newly received information in subsequent rounds because its outgoing messages in round r depend only on its unchanged state.)
- (W,t)-quiescent: If the algorithm may irrevocably write outputs on a patch B(v,W) during v’s window, we call it (W,t)-quiescent if only nodes in B(v,W+t) may change state in that window.

- Correct separation for parallel batching: To parallelize all same-color windows for t rounds without interference, it is necessary to forbid any edge between distinct active regions. For W=0 the active region for v is B(v,t). Thus, a proper coloring of G^{2t+1} (not merely G^{2t}) guarantees that for same-color u,v, dist(u,v) ≥ 2t+2, hence dist(B(u,t), B(v,t)) ≥ 2. This eliminates one-hop coupling across region boundaries. With W>0, color G^{2t+2W+1} so that distinct active regions B(·,W+t) have mutual distance ≥ 2.

- Why quiescence removes the “idle-accumulation” pitfall: In the unrestricted model, nodes can encode the number of prior arrivals into their state and/or messages, letting each new window see different ambient information; batching then fails. Under quiescence, any vertex whose t-window has not yet been processed cannot track steps that do not involve it, so its local view (modulo the already-arrived graph and earlier colors) is invariant across the internal order within a color class. Combined with the ≥2 separation between active regions, the parallel t-round simulation per color faithfully matches any sequential permutation of that color.

- Examples that fit quiescence: Greedy MIS and greedy maximal matching on bounded-degree graphs (W=1, t=1) where only the newly active 1-neighborhood changes, and (Δ+1)-vertex-coloring rules that finalize a 1-hop patch around the arrival.

Remark on Lemma 7 (2t-commutativity)
- The lemma remains valid even if nodes outside B(u,t) ∪ B(w,t) perform deterministic updates depending only on the global step index (and not on messages). Those nodes experience the same two consecutive step indices before and after the swap; hence their pair of updates is identical.

Lower-bound program (outline) for Online-LOCAL on trees
- Target: Prove that sinkless orientation on bounded-degree trees admits no deterministic Online-LOCAL(t)=O(1) algorithm (adversarial arrival). Use Lemma 7/Cor. 7.1 to normalize prefixes so that only B(e,2t) arrives before deciding edge e. Then adapt the node↔edge round-elimination locally inside B(e,2t), iterating 2t times to obtain a 0-round contradiction with the ID-graph property. Formalizing this (LB.1–LB.2) would non-constructively imply: any LCL with constant-t Online-LOCAL on trees lies in the O(1)/Θ(log* n) class, so there exists an O(log* n) deterministic LOCAL algorithm.

Next steps
- Integrate the quiescent bridge with K=2t+1 (resp. 2t+2W+1) into output.md.
- Begin the path (t=1) state-elimination-by-quiescence attempt with a precise interface Σ(u→v) and normalized histories (via Cor. 7.1). Either prove context-invariance or extract a counterexample LCL.
- In parallel, formalize LB.1–LB.2 for sinkless orientation as described above.
Additions (witness localization, phase-locality, and LB pitfalls)

1) Strong witness localization at v (unrestricted Online-LOCAL(t)). Using Lemma 7 (2t-commutativity), one can bubble v leftward across any predecessor u with dist(u,v) > 2t. Performing all such swaps yields an arrival sequence in which every predecessor of v lies in B(v,2t). Moreover, the set of predecessors of v inside B(v,2t) is unchanged, so the arrived subgraph just before v equals the restriction of the original arrived subgraph to B(v,2t). Each swap preserves the state on B(v,t) at v’s arrival; hence the state on B(v,t) when v arrives is identical before and after normalization. This refinement is now recorded as Lemma 9 in output.md.

2) Phase-locality under (W,t)-quiescence. In Lemma 8’s color-phase simulation with K = 2t+2W+1 (so that dist(R_v,R_w) ≥ 2 for R_v = B(v,W+t)), nodes outside R := ⋃ R_v keep their state fixed in the t rounds of the phase. Under standard LOCAL timing (send from current state; receive; update), such nodes cannot forward newly received information in later rounds. Therefore, there is no causal influence along any path that leaves one active region and re-enters another within the same phase. The transcript inside each R_v depends only on the initial boundary states, and the effects of different R_v commute. This is now formalized as Claim 8.1 inside Lemma 8’s proof.

3) Localized round-elimination on trees: modeling choices and a gap. The intended LB.1 (node→edge) step asserts that if both endpoints have local witnesses for opposite orientations of an edge e inside B(e,2t), then one can glue these into a single global execution that contradicts correctness. This is not valid for the node-form of sinkless orientation: both endpoints may “grab” e without violating the constraint that every node has at least one outgoing edge. To proceed, adopt one of:
- Edge-form LCL with decisive step at the second endpoint, so “double-witness in opposite directions” is a genuine contradiction; or
- A universal-quantifier version of the elimination step, together with a proof that the universal property is preserved by iteration; and in all cases
- A precise normalization-and-extension lemma: any normalized local arrival order inside B(e,2t) extends to a global order whose transcript inside B(e,t) (up to the decisive step for e) is preserved.

4) Radius sanity. The +1 in K = 2t+2W+1 (for quiescent batching) is necessary to guarantee dist(R_v,R_w) ≥ 2 and exclude one-round coupling across a single cross-edge. In contrast, in Corollary B we simulate a derived sequential (R,W)-rule and only require K = max(2W, R+W) (no +1).

Next steps (crisp):
- Prove the normalization-and-extension lemma for balls B(e,2t) on trees.
- Fix the problem model for the LB route (edge-form with a decisive step, or a universal-quantifier variant) and re-state LB.1/LB.2 accordingly; then supply complete proofs.
- Continue the path, t=1 interface study under quiescence or output-only; either prove context-invariance or give a counterexample LCL confined to B(v,2).
Critical audit: normalization around an edge and boundary freezing

- Edge-prefix extension (valid). For any edge e=uv and any finite arrival prefix τ consisting of distinct vertices of B(e,2t), there is a global arrival order σ whose first |τ| arrivals are exactly τ, and no vertex outside B(e,2t) arrives before those steps. Running A on σ and on the induced local execution confined to the arrived subgraph inside B(e,2t) produces identical states/outputs on B(e,t) at each of those |τ| steps. This is immediate from the model: outside vertices are simply absent.

- The converse normalization (invalid). It is not generally possible to transform an arbitrary global schedule into one in which no vertex outside B(e,2t) arrives before the decisive moment for e while preserving the state on B(e,t) step-by-step (or even at the decisive moment). The obstruction is that outside arrivals at distance > 2t from e can influence B(e,t) before the second endpoint arrives via chains of arrivals inside B(e,2t), and Lemma 7 (2t-commutativity) allows swaps only for pairs of arrivals at pairwise distance > 2t.

Counterexample (t = 1 on a path). Let the path be … x3 – x2 – x1 – u – v – y1 – y2 – y3 … with e = uv. Consider an Online-LOCAL(1) algorithm A that maintains at each arrived node a persistent bit s (initially 0). Upon an arrival of w, in the single LOCAL round each already-arrived node sends its current s to arrived neighbors; the new node w sets its own s to the parity of the s-values it receives (or 0 if it has no arrived neighbor). Now take the arrival order: x3 (outside B(e,2)), x2, x1, u (first endpoint), v (second endpoint). When x2 arrives, it sets s(x2) based on s(x3); then x1 sets s(x1) based on s(x2); by the time v arrives, s(x1) depends on x3’s early arrival, and the state on B(e,1) at the decisive moment reflects that influence. One cannot push x3 past v by a sequence of swaps allowed by Lemma 7 without encountering swaps with x2 or x1, which are at distance ≤ 2t from x3. Thus the “moreover” normalization fails even on a path.

Implication for elimination. Any node→edge elimination step that freezes a boundary ∂B around e and then quantifies over local schedules inside B must justify why the boundary states are fixed and unaffected by outside arrivals up to the decisive time. In the unrestricted online model, boundary nodes may change state many times before e is decided, driven by outside arrivals; there is no general way to ignore or freeze that evolution. Consequently, the proposed universal set-valued rule that depends only on B(e,2t) and a fixed boundary snapshot is not yet sound.

On finite type spaces. Classical round-elimination relies on a finite set of local types induced by t-round views. Here, without restrictions (output-only, quiescence, finite-state, ID-obliviousness), the set of possible boundary states at distance 2t is unbounded. Any lower-bound scheme must either (i) prove a compaction lemma that only finitely many boundary features can influence the decision at e, or (ii) work within a restricted model where such a bound is immediate.

On the “+1” in K for quiescent batching. The rationale remains correct: to forbid any within-phase signal that leaves one active region and re-enters another, we must ensure there is no single cross-edge between distinct active regions. For W=0, R_v=B(v,t); for general W, R_v=B(v,W+t). A proper coloring of G^{2t+2W+1} guarantees dist(R_v,R_w) ≥ 2 for same-color v≠w, which is exactly what Claim 8.1 uses.

Next steps.
- Keep only the safe edge-prefix extension fact; drop the converse normalization from any formal statements.
- If pursuing elimination, restrict the model to obtain finite boundary types (output-only, (W,t)-quiescent, or finite-state/ID-oblivious), and then formalize universal-set node↔edge steps, including exact radius accounting, preservation of nonemptiness, and node constraints.
- Alternatively, attempt a compaction lemma in the unrestricted model: prove that for sinkless orientation on trees, the orientation at e at the decisive moment depends only on a finite equivalence class of the evolving boundary at radius 2t. If this fails, document a counterexample LCL.
- Optionally, provide a formal tightness example for the +1 in Lemma 8 with t≥2 on paths to complement the existing remark.

Model and definitions
- Graphs: finite, simple, maximum degree Δ < ∞ (bounded degree). Nodes have unique IDs from a polynomial range (standard LOCAL assumptions). dist(·,·) is the hop distance; B(v,r) is the radius-r ball around v.
- LCL Π: a locally checkable labeling problem with constant checkability radius r_Π.
- Order-robust sequential rules with bounded writes: A deterministic rule S with read radius R and write radius W is a procedure that, when processing v in a vertex order σ, inspects G[B(v,R)] and the outputs already fixed in B(v,R) ∩ {earlier vertices in σ}, and may irrevocably write outputs on any currently-unset vertices in B(v,W). The final labeling must satisfy Π for every σ. (The special case W=0 writes only at v.)
- Online-LOCAL(t): vertices arrive one by one; at each step the algorithm executes t synchronous LOCAL rounds on the subgraph induced by the arrived vertices; outputs are irrevocable; nodes may maintain arbitrary local state across steps unless otherwise restricted.
- Output-only Online-LOCAL(t): the only persistent state is the immutable output label after it is set; in any t-round window, messages and local computation at a node may depend on the graph and currently known outputs within distance ≤ t from that node, but not on any other mutable state.
- t-local-dependence (at v): upon v’s arrival, its output depends only on the induced arrived subgraph and previously fixed outputs within B(v,t).
- Output-only, W-write Online-LOCAL(t): as output-only above, but when v arrives the algorithm may irrevocably fix outputs on any vertices in B(v,W).

Lemma 1 (Power-graph coloring in O(k log* n))
Statement. Let G be a bounded-degree graph and k ≥ 1 a constant. There is a deterministic LOCAL algorithm that computes a proper vertex coloring of the power graph G^k with at most C = Δ^{O(k)} colors in O(k log* n) rounds on G.
Proof. Standard: simulate an O(log* n)-round O(Δ(G^k)^2)-coloring on G^k by k rounds per step on G; Δ(G^k) ≤ Δ^k, hence C = Δ^{O(k)}. □

Lemma 2 (Color-phased simulation for W=0)
Statement. Let S be an order-robust sequential rule with read radius r that writes only at the current node (W=0). Given a proper coloring of G^r, processing colors 1,…,C in order reproduces S for any order respecting the color layering, using O(r) rounds per color.
Proof. If φ(u)=φ(v) then dist(u,v)>r, hence the decisions in phase i depend only on outputs from earlier colors and do not interfere. Each node gathers outputs in B(·,r) from earlier colors in O(r) rounds and applies S. □

Theorem A (Sequential-local (W=0) ⇒ LOCAL)
Statement. If Π admits an order-robust r-local sequential algorithm (W=0), then Π has a deterministic LOCAL algorithm running in O(r log* n + Δ^{O(r)}·r) rounds. For constant Δ,r: O(log* n).
Proof. Compute a G^r-coloring in O(r log* n) rounds (Lemma 1), then simulate by Lemma 2. □

Lemma 3 (Output-only Online-LOCAL(t), W=0 ⇒ sequential with read radius 2t)
Statement. If Π has a deterministic output-only Online-LOCAL(t) algorithm correct for every arrival order, then Π admits an order-robust sequential algorithm with read radius 2t (W=0) that reproduces the online outputs for any order.
Proof. Fix order σ. When v_i arrives online under σ, only nodes in B(v_i,t) can send messages that reach v_i within t rounds. Under output-only, any such message depends only on outputs within the sender’s B(·,t), all contained in B(v_i,2t). Hence v_i’s t-window transcript and output are functions of the restriction to B(v_i,2t) of the arrived subgraph and outputs. Define the sequential rule to read those and return the same output as the online algorithm would under σ. Correctness and order-robustness follow. □

Lemma 4 (Bridge under t-local-dependence, W=0)
Statement. If Π has a deterministic Online-LOCAL(t) algorithm with t-local-dependence (at every v) that is correct for every arrival order, then Π admits an order-robust sequential algorithm with read radius t (W=0).
Proof. As in Lemma 3, but with t in place of 2t by hypothesis. □

Corollary A (Bounded-degree trees, constant r or t)
Statement. On bounded-degree trees, if Π has either (i) an order-robust r-local sequential algorithm (W=0) with constant r, or (ii) an output-only Online-LOCAL(t) algorithm (W=0) with constant t, or (iii) an Online-LOCAL(t) algorithm with t-local-dependence and constant t, then Π has a deterministic LOCAL algorithm with round complexity O(log* n).
Proof. Combine Theorem A with Lemma 3 or Lemma 4 as applicable; Δ and radii are constants. □

Lemma 5 (Color-phased simulation with bounded writes)
Statement. Let S be an order-robust sequential rule with read radius R and write radius W ≥ 0 (S may write outputs on currently-unset vertices in B(v,W)). Let φ be a proper coloring of G^{K} with K = max(2W, R+W). Then processing colors 1,…,C in order reproduces S for any order that respects the color layering. The per-color communication cost is O(R) rounds after φ is known.
Proof. If φ(u)=φ(v) then dist(u,v) > K ≥ 2W and > R+W. Thus (i) B(u,W) ∩ B(v,W) = ∅ (no write–write conflicts) and (ii) B(u,R) ∩ B(v,W) = ∅ and B(v,R) ∩ B(u,W) = ∅ (no read–write interference). In phase i, each vertex v with φ(v)=i gathers outputs written by earlier colors within B(v,R) and computes its writes; because of (i)–(ii), these writes are independent across same-color vertices and depend only on earlier colors, so the result matches S for any order that lists all lower colors first and then the current color in any internal order. O(R) rounds suffice to gather B(v,R) information. Computing φ takes O(K log* n) rounds by Lemma 1 with k=K. □

Lemma 6 (Output-only, W-write Online-LOCAL(t) ⇒ sequential with (R,W)=(2t+W,W))
Statement. If Π has a deterministic output-only, W-write Online-LOCAL(t) algorithm A correct for every arrival order, then Π admits a deterministic order-robust sequential rule S that, when processing v, reads only B(v, 2t+W), may write on currently-unset vertices in B(v,W), and reproduces A’s outputs for any order.
Proof. Fix order σ = (v_1,…,v_n). Consider A under arrival order σ. When v_i arrives, during its t-round window only nodes within distance ≤ t of the patch B(v_i,W) can send messages that reach the patch; hence all influencing senders lie in N := B(B(v_i,W), t) = B(v_i, W+t). Under output-only, messages sent by any u ∈ N depend only on outputs within B(u,t). Therefore the union of outputs that can affect the patch’s decisions lies in M := ⋃_{u∈N} B(u,t) = B(v_i, W+2t). Consequently, the t-round transcript determining the patch outputs in the σ-run is a function of the restriction of the arrived subgraph and already-fixed outputs to B(v_i, 2t+W). Define S as follows: when processing v_i under σ, S collects the already-fixed outputs within B(v_i, 2t+W) ∩ {v_1,…,v_{i-1}} and deterministically reproduces A’s t-window decisions on the patch given that local view, writing only to vertices in B(v_i,W) whose outputs are not yet fixed. Because A is deterministic and respects irrevocability, this reproduces exactly the same patch outputs as A under σ and never overwrites. As A is correct for every order, S is an order-robust (R,W)-local rule with R=2t+W. □

Corollary B (Bounded-degree trees, output-only W-write ⇒ O(log* n) LOCAL)
Statement. On bounded-degree trees, if Π has a deterministic output-only, W-write Online-LOCAL(t) algorithm with constants t,W, then Π has a deterministic LOCAL algorithm with round complexity O(log* n).
Proof. Apply Lemma 6 to obtain a sequential (R,W)-rule with R=2t+W. Then use Lemma 5 with K = max(2W, R+W) = max(2W, 2t+2W) = 2t+2W to simulate S in the LOCAL model: compute a proper coloring of G^{2t+2W} in O((2t+2W) log* n) rounds, then spend O(R)=O(2t+W) rounds per color. For constant Δ,t,W the total is O(log* n). □

Lemma 7 (2t-commutativity of independent consecutive arrivals)
Statement. Let A be any deterministic Online-LOCAL(t) algorithm (unrestricted mutable state). Consider an arrival sequence σ and two consecutive arrival steps at vertices u and w such that dist(u,w) > 2t. Let σ′ be obtained by swapping these two steps. Then, after these two steps, the states and fixed outputs at all vertices are identical under σ and under σ′.
Proof. Let G_i be the arrived subgraph just before these two steps. In the step when u arrives under σ, A executes t synchronous rounds on G_i ∪ {u}. Messages can traverse at most t hops per window, so only nodes in B(u,t) can be influenced (either by receiving messages or by depending on received messages); nodes outside B(u,t) undergo the same deterministic state updates as they would in any window where they receive the same (empty) messages. Likewise, w’s step affects only B(w,t). Because dist(u,w) > 2t, the balls B(u,t) and B(w,t) are disjoint, and w is absent during u’s step and u is absent during w’s step in both σ and σ′. Therefore the t-round transcripts and resulting updates within B(u,t) (resp. B(w,t)) are identical in σ and σ′, and all other vertices experience no message-dependent changes in either order. Thus the combined effect of the two steps commutes. □

Corollary 7.1 (Pushing far-away arrivals past v)
Statement. Fix v and any arrival sequence. By repeatedly swapping consecutive independent steps via Lemma 7, one can transform the sequence into another in which all vertices at distance > 2t from v arrive after v, without changing any states or outputs within B(v,t) at the time v arrives (or thereafter).
Proof. Iteratively swap any arrival at distance > 2t from v forward past earlier arrivals until it occurs after v; Lemma 7 ensures the swaps preserve the relevant states/outputs. □

Remark. Lemma 5 supersedes the earlier, flawed variant that required only a G^{R+W}-coloring; the counterexample R=0, W=1 on a 3-path shows that G^{R+W} is insufficient because write–write conflicts may occur.
Remark (No faithful t-per-color batching for unrestricted Online-LOCAL(t)). There exists a deterministic Online-LOCAL(1) algorithm A and a valid color-by-color arrival order σ_φ (induced by a proper coloring φ of G^2 on a path) such that any LOCAL simulation that processes all vertices of the same color class simultaneously in O(1) rounds cannot reproduce the exact outputs produced by A under the sequential σ_φ-run.
Proof. Consider the trivial LCL Π that accepts any labeling. Algorithm A maintains at each arrived node a parity bit p (initially 0) that toggles at every arrival step (regardless of messages). When a new vertex v arrives, in its 1-round window it reads p from an already-arrived neighbor if one exists and outputs that bit (if v has no arrived neighbor, it outputs 0). Fix any proper 3-coloring φ of the path’s G^2 and let σ_φ process colors 1,2,3 in order, with any internal order inside a color. In the sequential σ_φ-run, the parity p toggles at every arrival, hence the outputs of the vertices of any color class alternate with the internal order. In contrast, if one processes all vertices of a color class simultaneously in a single 1-round batch (keeping not-yet-processed colors absent), all these vertices observe the same parity p from earlier colors and therefore all output the same bit. Thus the batched simulation does not reproduce A’s outputs under σ_φ. □

Remark (Complexity accounting for Lemma 5/Corollary B). On bounded-degree graphs with constants t,W, the coloring step on G^{K} (K = max(2W, R+W), with R = 2t+W in Corollary B) costs O(K·log* n) rounds and yields C = Δ^{O(K)} colors; the per-color work is O(R). Hence the total complexity is O(log* n), dominated by the coloring step.
Definition (Quiescent Online-LOCAL(t) and (W,t)-quiescent)
Consider the standard LOCAL timing in an arrival step: in each of t synchronous rounds, each arrived node first sends messages as a (deterministic) function of its current state, then receives messages from neighbors, and finally updates its state as a (deterministic) function of its current state and the received messages.
- An Online-LOCAL(t) algorithm A is quiescent if, upon the arrival of v, during the ensuing t rounds every node u with dist(u,v) > t does not change its state in any of these t rounds.
- More generally, A is (W,t)-quiescent if, upon the arrival of v, during the ensuing t rounds only nodes in the active region B(v, W+t) may change their state; nodes outside B(v,W+t) do not change state.

Lemma 8 (Quiescent Online-LOCAL(t) ⇒ O(log* n) LOCAL; bounded-writes variant)
Let Π be an LCL on bounded-degree graphs. Suppose Π has a deterministic quiescent Online-LOCAL(t) algorithm A with constant t.
(i) Then Π admits a deterministic LOCAL algorithm with round complexity O((2t+1)·log* n + t·Δ^{O(t)}) = O(log* n).
(ii) More generally, if A is (W,t)-quiescent with constants W,t, then Π admits a deterministic LOCAL algorithm with round complexity O((2t+2W+1)·log* n + t·Δ^{O(t+W)}) = O(log* n).

Proof.
Fix K := 2t+1 in case (i), and K := 2t+2W+1 in case (ii). By Lemma 1, compute a proper coloring φ of G^{K} with C = Δ^{O(K)} colors in O(K·log* n) rounds. We process the colors in increasing order i = 1,2,…,C in phases; at the start of phase i, exactly the vertices of colors < i are considered “already arrived,” and vertices of colors ≥ i are “not yet arrived.”

In phase i we simulate, in parallel, the t-round online arrival window of every vertex v with φ(v)=i, on the subgraph induced by vertices of colors ≤ i, as follows: (a) we declare all vertices of color i to “arrive” at the beginning of the phase, and (b) we perform t synchronous LOCAL rounds on that induced subgraph. During this phase, the algorithm A is executed faithfully at every vertex, except that vertices of colors > i are absent.

Let R_v denote the active region of v during this phase: R_v = B(v,t) in case (i) and R_v = B(v, W+t) in case (ii). Because φ colors G^{K} with K as above, for any two distinct same-color vertices v,w we have dist(v,w) ≥ K+1, hence dist(R_v, R_w) ≥ 2. In particular, there is no edge between R_v and R_w.

Quiescence and the LOCAL timing imply two key facts within phase i:
1) Only nodes in R := ⋃_{φ(v)=i} R_v may change state during the t rounds of phase i; all nodes outside R keep their state fixed throughout the phase. Since messages sent in a round depend only on the sender’s current state at the start of that round, such outside nodes cannot forward newly received information in subsequent rounds. Consequently, there is no causal influence along any path that leaves one R_v and re-enters another R_w within the t rounds, because such a path must traverse at least one node outside R which cannot propagate new information.
2) Since dist(R_v, R_w) ≥ 2, there is neither an edge nor a length-1 path between distinct active regions.

From 1)–2) it follows that, during phase i, the evolution of each R_v is identical to what would occur if we executed only v’s t-round window in isolation (with all other color-i vertices absent), given the same boundary states on the external neighborhood of R_v (which are precisely the states fixed by earlier colors). Formally, this can be proved by induction on the round counter r=1,…,t, using the domain-of-dependence that is confined to R_v together with outside nodes whose states remain constant.

Therefore, the combined effect of phase i equals the composition of the individual “v-arrival” windows over all vertices v with φ(v)=i, in any internal order. By induction on i, after finishing phase i the global state/output coincides with the online execution that processes first all color-1 vertices (in an arbitrary order), then all color-2 vertices, and so on. Since A is correct for every arrival order, the final labeling after phase C is legal for Π.

The complexity is O(K·log* n) to obtain φ and t rounds per color, i.e., O(t·C) additional rounds. For constant Δ, t, W, we have C = Δ^{O(K)} = O(1), so the total is O(log* n). □

Remark (on the choice of K). The choice K = 2t (resp. 2t+2W) is insufficient for the parallel phase: if dist(v,w)=2t+1 (resp. 2t+2W+1), then R_v and R_w are disjoint but may be adjacent by an edge, allowing one-round coupling between the two active regions. The value K = 2t+1 (resp. 2t+2W+1) guarantees dist(R_v, R_w) ≥ 2, which prevents such coupling and makes the above proof sound.

Remark after Lemma 7 (idle updates depending on step index). In Lemma 7, nodes outside B(u,t) ∪ B(w,t) may perform deterministic updates that depend on the global step counter but not on messages. When two consecutive arrivals at u and w with dist(u,w) > 2t are swapped, those nodes still undergo the same two consecutive step indices in the same order, so their pair of updates is unchanged. This clarifies that Lemma 7 tolerates such idle updates.
Lemma 9 (Strong witness-localization at a vertex)
Statement. Let A be any deterministic Online-LOCAL(t) algorithm on a bounded-degree graph G, let σ be any arrival sequence, and let v be any vertex. There exists an arrival sequence σ_v obtained from σ by repeatedly swapping adjacent arrivals such that:
(i) Every vertex that arrives before v in σ_v lies in B(v,2t).
(ii) The arrived subgraph just before v arrives in σ_v equals the restriction to B(v,2t) of the arrived subgraph just before v arrives in σ (i.e., the set of predecessors of v inside B(v,2t) is unchanged).
(iii) The entire state and the fixed outputs on B(v,t) at the moment v arrives are identical under σ and under σ_v.

Proof. Starting from σ, repeatedly swap v with its immediate predecessor u whenever dist(u,v) > 2t. Each such swap is between two consecutive arrivals u and v whose t-neighborhoods are disjoint; by Lemma 7 (2t-commutativity), the global state after these two steps is identical independent of their order. After no more such swaps are possible, every predecessor of v has distance ≤ 2t from v, proving (i). During this process, we swap v only with vertices at distance > 2t, so the set of predecessors of v within B(v,2t) is unchanged, and therefore the arrived subgraph in B(v,2t) just before v is the same as in σ; this is (ii). Property (iii) follows because each swap preserves the state on B(v,t) (by Lemma 7), and hence the state on B(v,t) at the time v arrives is invariant under the sequence of swaps. □

Claim 8.1 (Phase-locality under (W,t)-quiescence; to be used within Lemma 8).
Fix a proper coloring φ of G^{K} with K = 2t+2W+1 and consider phase i of the simulation in Lemma 8, where all vertices v with φ(v)=i “arrive” simultaneously and we run t synchronous LOCAL rounds on the subgraph induced by colors ≤ i. For each such v, let R_v = B(v, W+t). Then, during phase i:
(a) Only nodes in R := ⋃_{φ(v)=i} R_v may change state; nodes outside R keep their state fixed throughout the phase.
(b) For each v, the t-round transcript (states and messages) on R_v depends only on A and on the initial states on R_v together with the states on the external neighborhood ∂R_v at the start of the phase (i.e., after phase i−1), and is identical to the transcript obtained by executing only v’s t-round window in isolation with those boundary states.
(c) The combined effect of the phase equals the composition, in any order, of the individual arrival windows of the vertices with φ(v)=i.

Proof. Because φ is a proper coloring of G^{K} with K = 2t+2W+1, any distinct same-color vertices v,w satisfy dist(v,w) ≥ K+1, hence dist(R_v,R_w) ≥ (K+1) − 2(W+t) = 2; in particular, there is no edge between R_v and R_w. By (W,t)-quiescence, during the t rounds of the phase only nodes within distance ≤ t of B(v,W) for some v with φ(v)=i may change state; the union of these sets is precisely R, proving (a). Under the standard LOCAL timing (in each round: send based only on the current state; then receive; then update), a node whose state does not change in a given round cannot make its outgoing messages depend on newly received information in later rounds unless its state changes; thus nodes outside R cannot relay any information originating in one active region to another during the phase. An induction on the round counter r=1,…,t shows that the state/message evolution on each R_v is identical to the evolution when executing only v’s t-round window with the same boundary states (states on ∂R_v are fixed by (a)), establishing (b). Since there is no causal influence between distinct active regions within the phase and no edge between them, the per-region effects commute, yielding (c). □

Remark (Why no +1 in Corollary B but +1 in Lemma 8). In Corollary B we first derive a sequential (R,W)-rule with R = 2t+W from the output-only online algorithm, and then simulate this sequential rule using a proper coloring of G^{K} with K = max(2W, R+W). This simulation does not execute concurrent online t-windows; independence is guaranteed by avoiding read–write and write–write conflicts for the sequential rule, and no extra +1 is needed. In contrast, Lemma 8 batches online t-windows of the same color in parallel; to prevent even a single cross-edge between distinct active regions during the t rounds, we require dist(R_v,R_w) ≥ 2, which is ensured by K = 2t+2W+1 (the +1 is necessary).
