{"feedback_md":"Thank you for the two detailed reports. Here is a consolidated audit and guidance.\n\nHigh-confidence and ready to archive\n- Prover 01’s Lemma S (adversarial schedule-localization for an edge) is sound and valuable. It does not attempt any converse normalization; it simply exploits the adversary’s freedom to postpone all vertices outside B(e,2t) until after the decisive moment for e, ensuring that the run up to that moment depends only on the structure and internal arrival order inside B(e,2t). This is the correct model-compliant primitive we were missing for edge-centered arguments. I have added a rigorous statement and proof as a new lemma to output.md.\n\nCorrections needed / issues\n- Prover 01’s LB.1u′ (node→edge universal set step with S_e(X_e) built on B(e,2t)) has a critical compositionality flaw in the “no-sink-in-sets” argument. S_e(X_e) is defined by quantifying only over internal orders inside B(e,2t) with all vertices of B(e,2t) present and the outside absent. However, to argue that a node w cannot be a sink, the proof switches to a schedule over the union U_w := ⋃_{e∋w} B(e,2t). In that schedule, when deciding an edge e=wx, there may already be vertices present from U_w \\ B(e,2t), and their arrival windows can influence the internal nodes of B(e,2t) before e is decided. Thus the edge’s decision in the U_w-schedule need not coincide with any outcome from S_e(X_e). In particular, one cannot conclude that if all S_e exclude “outward from w,” then w would necessarily be a sink in the U_w-schedule. This gap breaks the current LB.1u′.\n- Remedy for the above: shift the set construction to the node level. Define, for each node w, a set T_w on the type of U_w (a constant-radius ball around w, e.g., radius 2t+1) that records which incident port(s) can be oriented outward under adversarial arrival orders restricted to U_w (outside absent). Then the “no-sink-in-sets” property at w follows directly from correctness (if all ports were forbidden, w would be a sink in some valid schedule on U_w). Only after this node-level step should one attempt the symmetric edge-level step, carefully tracking radius changes. This avoids the non-composability of per-edge S_e based on B(e,2t).\n- Prover 02’s LBoo.1 (output-only lower bound) is on the right track but the definition of S_e(X) is too strong: defining S_e(X) as the set of orientations that occur for every internal order (intersection over orders) need not be nonempty. Deterministic output-only algorithms can easily have e’s outcome depend on the internal order, yielding S_e(X)=∅. Replace this by the union-over-orders definition (set of orientations that occur under some internal order). The subsequent “no-sink” argument then faces the same composability issue as above and should be repaired via node-level sets on a slightly larger neighborhood U_w.\n\nOn the +1 tightness\n- Both reports argue the necessity of the “+1” in Lemma 8’s K=2t+2W+1. This matches our current remark and is correct in spirit. However, neither report includes a fully explicit quiescent W=0, t=2 construction. Please supply a concrete algorithm A with exact round-by-round behavior showing a two-hop coupling across a single cross-edge when K=2t. Until then, we keep the necessity as a remark rather than a formal proposition in output.md.\n\nNext-step suggestions\n1) Repair the lower-bound set framework:\n   - Define node-centered admissible sets T_w on types of U_w (radius ≈ 2t+1) under “outside-U_w absent” schedules; prove: (i) finiteness of types (via the ID-graph framework), (ii) nonemptiness of T_w, (iii) the node-side “no-sink in sets.”\n   - Then formalize an edge-centered step that derives per-edge sets from per-node sets while preserving nonemptiness and the node constraint; audit the radius drop precisely and ensure composability under the same adversarial scheduling principle. Only once both half-steps are formally proved should we attempt 2t iterations and the 0-round contradiction via the ID-graph.\n2) Output-only variant: redo LBoo.1 with union-over-orders and node-level sets on U_w; state the invariants and the type finiteness carefully. This is the lowest-risk regime to land a clean lower bound.\n3) Provide the explicit t=2 path example for the +1 necessity (quiescent, W=0), with a round-by-round transcript illustrating the 2-hop relay across the cross-edge.\n\nOverall assessment: solid progress on the scheduling primitive (now archived), good alignment on quiescent/bridging facts, but the current edge-centered set step needs restructuring at the node level to avoid a real compositionality bug. Please prioritize the node-level set formalization with clear radii and invariants.","new_notes_md":"New: Adversarial schedule-localization for an edge and audit of edge-centered set steps\n\nEdge-local adversarial scheduling (safe primitive)\n- Lemma S (informal). For any edge e=uv and t≥1, the adversary can choose an arrival order in which all vertices of B(e,2t) arrive before any vertex outside B(e,2t). In such a run, the decision that A makes at e at the moment the second endpoint arrives depends only on the labeled type of B(e,2t) and on the internal arrival order within that ball; the outside is simply absent up to that moment.\n- Rationale. This is not a transformation of a given schedule but a fresh adversarial choice, fully permitted in the model (A must succeed for all arrival orders). The lemma avoids any boundary-freezing assumption or converse normalization.\n\nAudit: why the proposed node→edge universal set step on B(e,2t) breaks at a node w\n- Setup. Prover 01 defines S_e(X_e) for each edge e using only the 2t-ball around e (outside absent) and claims a node-side \"no-sink in sets\" property: at each w, among incident edges e∋w at least one S_e contains an orientation pointing away from w.\n- Issue (non-composability across edges). The proof switches to a schedule over U_w := ⋃_{e∋w} B(e,2t) that decides all edges at w while keeping outside-U_w absent. For a given e=wx, this schedule may include arrivals of vertices in U_w\\B(e,2t) before e is decided; their windows can alter states of nodes inside B(e,2t) via boundary interactions over multiple steps. Consequently, the decision at e in this U_w-schedule need not be among those seen when only B(e,2t) is present. Hence one cannot conclude that forbidding “outward at w” in all S_e forces w to be a sink in the U_w-schedule. This breaks the claimed node-side constraint for the S_e defined on B(e,2t).\n\nFix: define node-centered sets on U_w\n- Define U_w as the union of radius-2t edge-balls around edges incident to w. On trees and for fixed Δ,t, U_w has constant size (radius ≈ 2t+1 around w).\n- Define a node-centered set T_w(X_w) on the finite type X_w of U_w (port-colored, ID-graph labeled) as the set of incident port directions at w that can be oriented outward under some internal arrival order confined to U_w (outside-U_w absent) while deciding all incident edges. Nonemptiness of T_w follows from correctness: if T_w were empty, then in every internal order on U_w the run would decide all incident edges pointing into w, making w a sink in a valid schedule.\n- After this node-side step is formalized, attempt the symmetric derivation of per-edge sets from neighbors’ node-sets, carefully auditing radius changes and ensuring that admissibility and node-side constraints are preserved under the same adversarial scheduling principle.\n\nOutput-only variant (repair to LBoo.1)\n- Use union-over-orders (not intersection) for admissible sets and work with node-centered T_w on U_w. In output-only, type finiteness is immediate (finite output alphabet; bounded-radius balls). The same composability caveat applies if one insists on per-edge sets based on B(e,2t); prefer node-level sets on U_w for the “no-sink” constraint.\n\nOn the +1 in Lemma 8\n- The necessity of K=2t+2W+1 is correct in spirit. To promote this to a formal proposition, provide an explicit quiescent (W=0), t=2 algorithm on a path that uses a 2-round relay across a single cross-edge to couple the two active regions when K=2t, thereby violating phase-independence. Until the explicit construction is documented, we retain the existing explanatory remark after Lemma 8.\n\nAction items\n- Formalize T_w on U_w (types, finiteness, nonemptiness, and node-side “no-sink”) and then the edge↔node half-step with precise radius accounting.\n- For the output-only regime, rework LBoo.1 accordingly and track the invariants under iteration to a 0-round contradiction via the ID-graph.\n- Provide the explicit t=2 path example for the +1 necessity.\n","new_notes_append":"True","new_outputs_md":"Lemma S (Adversarial schedule-localization for an edge)\nStatement. Let A be any deterministic Online-LOCAL(t) algorithm (t ≥ 1) on a bounded-degree graph G, and let e = uv be an edge. Consider any edge-decided LCL semantics in which the label of e is irrevocably fixed at the time the second endpoint of e arrives. Then there exists an arrival sequence σ(e) with the following properties:\n(i) All vertices in the ball B(e,2t) arrive before any vertex outside B(e,2t).\n(ii) The second endpoint of e arrives within this prefix, so that e’s label is decided within the prefix.\n(iii) The entire online execution of A up to the decisive moment for e depends only on the labeled type of B(e,2t) (graph structure, port colors, IDs) and on the internal arrival order of the vertices of B(e,2t); vertices outside B(e,2t) are absent and cannot affect the transcript.\n\nProof. Fix any ordering τ of the vertices of B(e,2t) in which the second endpoint of e appears last. Define σ(e) by listing the vertices of B(e,2t) according to τ, followed by all vertices of G \\ B(e,2t) in any order. During the prefix consisting of B(e,2t), the arrived subgraph equals the induced subgraph on B(e,2t), and each arrival triggers t synchronous LOCAL rounds on that subgraph alone; vertices outside B(e,2t) are absent and neither send nor receive messages. The label of e is decided when its second endpoint arrives (the last vertex of the prefix), and the decision depends only on the labeled type of B(e,2t) and on the internal arrival order τ.
