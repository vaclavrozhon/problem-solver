High-level assessment. Both reports are aligned with the previously identified flaw: per-edge admissible sets based on B(e,2t) are not compositional at nodes. Moving to node-centered admissible sets on U_w := ⋃_{e∋w} B(e,2t) is the right fix. The proposed Lemma T (node-centered admissible ports) is sound under edge-decided semantics for sinkless orientation: if T_w(X_w)=∅, then in every internal order confined to U_w all incident edges are decided into w, so w is a permanent sink in a valid schedule (outside absent), contradicting correctness. This uses union-over-orders (existential quantification) per port, which is exactly what is needed for a “no-sink-in-sets” invariant at nodes.

What to archive now. We can safely add (i) a node-local adversarial scheduling lemma (S_node), mirroring Lemma S but centered at a node; (ii) Lemma T with precise definitions and proof; (iii) a simple node→edge derivation S_e from the endpoint T-sets together with the preserved node-side no-sink invariant and the explicit radius accounting (2t+1 around nodes/edges); and (iv) a concrete quiescent t=2 example establishing the necessity of the +1 in K = 2t+1 in Lemma 8. I have archived all four.

Caveats and corrections. Do not claim finite type spaces unless you explicitly restrict IDs (e.g., via an ID-graph H with bounded alphabet and sufficiently large girth) or impose ID-obliviousness/finite-state. Earlier we noted that finite enumeration over ID-labeled types is false in general. I therefore stated Lemma T without a finiteness clause and added a remark about how finiteness becomes available under the ID-graph framework when we need it for iteration.

On the proposed example for +1 necessity: the set R_a = B(a,2) was misstated in 01 (it omitted the left side). I provide a cleaned, fully quiescent W=0, t=2 algorithm on a path, with two same-color new arrivals at distance 5 and a single cross-edge between their active regions; in two rounds, a one-hop signal crosses the cross-edge in round 1 and reaches each center in round 2, coupling the regions when K=2t. This exhibits the need for +1.

Promising direction and next steps. The node→edge half-step we just archived is robust and keeps all dependencies within constant-radius type spaces. The missing piece is the symmetric edge→node half-step with tight radius control. A workable template is:
- Define edge-level sets S_e over X_e = type of B(e,2t+1) by existential quantification over internal orders on Z = U_u ∪ U_v (outside absent); prove S_e(X_e) nonempty and local.
- Define a next node-level set T′_w from incident S_e (e.g., by universal or “intersection-of-compatibilities” quantification) so that (a) T′_w(X′_w) is still nonempty, (b) depends only on a bounded-radius type X′_w, and (c) the radius drops by 1/2 per half-step or at least stays bounded to allow O(t) alternations to reach radius 0.
- Keep union/existential at the “expansion” (node) step to preserve nonemptiness, and use intersection/universal at the “contraction” (edge) step to shrink sets. Prove preservation of the node-side no-sink invariant after each alternation.
- Once the alternation is formalized, invoke the ID-graph framework to obtain a finite set of types and derive the 0-round contradiction for sinkless orientation.

Value triage. The node-centered T_w and S_node are solid and immediately useful; the node→edge composition and the +1 tightness example are correct and worth archiving. The proposed edge→node step and iteration remain to be formalized; keep them in notes and proceed carefully with quantifier polarity and radius accounting. This is “partial success” with clear, actionable next steps.
