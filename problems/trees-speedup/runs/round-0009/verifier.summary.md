High-level assessment. Both reports are aligned with the previously identified flaw: per-edge admissible sets based on B(e,2t) are not compositional at nodes. Moving to node-centered admissible sets on U_w := ⋃_{e∋w} B(e,2t) is the right fix. The proposed Lemma T (node-centered admissible ports) is sound under edge-decided semantics for sinkless orientation: if T_w(X_w)=∅, then in every internal order confined to U_w all incident edges are decided into w, so w is a permanent sink in a valid schedule (outside absent), contradicting correctness. This uses union-over-orders (existential quantification) per port, which is exactly what is needed for a “no-sink-in-sets” invariant at nodes.
