In Round 0002, the focus was on generalizing Theorem 1.5 and its implications for trees. The approach shows promise, but careful interpretation of the theorem is crucial to avoid misapplication. Key properties of bounded-degree trees were identified as significant for generalization, and existing results for LCL problems were examined in relation to nonoriented trees. A comprehensive proof strategy is necessary to cover all cases, and relevant counterexamples must be constructed to demonstrate the theorem's limitations effectively.
