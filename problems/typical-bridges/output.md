# Main Results



Main interim results toward the conjectures

- Root-invariance (Conjecture 1):
  • Nowhere-dense part resolved. For any property P of unrooted graphs, S_P is nowhere dense in the rooted space iff the corresponding set T_P in the unrooted space is nowhere dense. This uses the forgetful map π (continuous, open, surjective) and yields a root-free cylinder refinement criterion for saturated sets.
  • Meagre part resolved for all properties with the Baire property (in particular, Borel/analytic P): S_P is meagre in the rooted space iff T_P is meagre in the unrooted space. Hence smallness is root-invariant for all natural properties considered (bridges, cut vertices, edge-colouring constraints, etc.).

- Metric sensitivity (Conjecture 2):
  • No-go: Any metric that induces the same cylinder (Benjamini–Schramm) topology preserves typicality; in particular, bridgeless graphs remain nowhere dense under all such metrics.
  • Coarser “rootless-local” proximity: For a natural re-rooting–insensitive closeness, graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge are dense, indicating genuinely different behavior once the topology is coarsened. The Baire status and typicality under such a topology remain open.


New classification in the even-regular case

- In the D-regular space with even D≥4 (Benjamini–Schramm topology), bridgeless graphs are comeagre: 1-way bridges are parity-forbidden, while 2-way bridges form a meagre set. Thus, bridgeless is typical in this regime.
