Corrected statements and proofs toward Conjectures 1 and 2

Set‑up
- X = \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}: countably infinite, connected, rooted graphs with degree constraint (≤D or =D), equipped with the Benjamini–Schramm (BS) topology generated by rooted cylinders \{\mathbf{G}_{\bullet}^F\}.
- Y: unrooted, countably infinite, connected graphs with the same degree constraint, endowed with the rootless ‘occurs‑somewhere’ topology generated by U_F^Y = { G: ∃v, B_r(G,v) ≅ F } where F is a rooted r‑ball.
- Forgetful map π: X→Y, π(G,ρ)=G.

Lemma 1 (π is surjective and open; not continuous in general).
(i) For any rooted r‑ball F, π(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet}^F)=U_F^Y; hence π is surjective and open.
(ii) π need not be continuous: there exists F and (G,ρ)∈X with G∈U_F^Y but for every s there are H with B_s(H,ρ)=B_s(G,ρ) and H∉π^{-1}(U_F^Y).
Proof. (i) If (G,ρ)∈\mathbf{G}_{\bullet}^F then G contains an r‑ball isomorphic to F at ρ, so π(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet}^F)⊆U_F^Y. Conversely, if G∈U_F^Y via v, then (G,v)∈\mathbf{G}_{\bullet}^F and (G,v)∈π^{-1}(U_F^Y). Thus equality holds and π is open and surjective.
(ii) Fix D≥3 and let F be any rooted r‑ball containing a cycle. Construct G by starting from a rooted infinite tree T (degree ≤D) and, at distance N≫r from ρ, graft a finite connected graph H_0 which contains a copy of F (as the r‑ball around some vertex), ensuring no other vertex of G has an r‑ball isomorphic to F (e.g., make T and the rest cycle‑free, and keep H_0 finite). Then G∈U_F^Y. For any s<N, modify G outside B_s(G,ρ) by replacing H_0 with a tree of maximum degree ≤D to obtain H. Then B_s(H,ρ)=B_s(G,ρ) but H∉π^{-1}(U_F^Y), showing π^{-1}(U_F^Y) is not open. ∎

Proposition 2 (One‑way transfer of nowhere denseness via openness).
If A⊆Y is nowhere dense in Y then π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X.
Proof. Let U be nonempty open in X. Then π(U) is nonempty open in Y. Since A is nowhere dense, there exists nonempty open V⊆π(U) with V∩A=∅. Then U′:=U∩π^{-1}(V) is nonempty open in X and U′∩π^{-1}(A)=∅. Hence π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense. ∎

Root‑free criterion for saturated sets
For an unrooted r‑ball B (finite connected graph of radius r), define the saturated cylinder Cyl(B):=⋃_{v∈V(B)} \mathbf{G}_{\bullet}^{(B,v)}⊆X.

Proposition 3 (Root‑free characterization of nowhere denseness in X for saturated sets).
Let S⊆X be saturated (i.e., re‑rooting within the same unrooted graph preserves membership). Then S is nowhere dense in X if and only if for every unrooted r‑ball B there exists an unrooted r′‑ball B′ with Cyl(B′)⊂Cyl(B)\S.
Proof. (⇒) If S is nowhere dense, every nonempty open set contains a smaller nonempty open set disjoint from S. Cyl(B) is a finite union of rooted cylinders, hence nonempty open whenever B occurs. Thus there is a rooted r′‑ball F′ with \mathbf{G}_{\bullet}^{F′}⊂Cyl(B)\S. Let B′ be the underlying unrooted ball of F′; then Cyl(B′)=⋃_{w} \mathbf{G}_{\bullet}^{(B′,w)}⊂Cyl(B)\S by saturation of S.
(⇐) Conversely, let U be nonempty open in X; pick a rooted cylinder \mathbf{G}_{\bullet}^F⊂U with underlying unrooted B. By hypothesis choose B′ with Cyl(B′)⊂Cyl(B)\S. Then Cyl(B′) is a nonempty open subset of U disjoint from S. Hence S is nowhere dense. ∎

Odd‑D regular bridge forcing
Let D≥3 be odd. For a finite connected graph F, define S(F):=∑_{v∈V(F)}(D−deg_F(v))=D|V(F)|−2|E(F)|. In any D‑regular completion H⊇F, the number of edges crossing the cut δ_H(V(F)) equals S(F).

Theorem 4 (Odd‑D: forcing a unique crossing edge inside a ball).
Let D≥3 be odd and let F=B_r(G,ρ) be any rooted r‑ball that occurs in \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}. There exist R≥r+1 and a rooted R‑ball F′ extending F with the properties:
(i) every vertex at distance <R from the root in F′ has degree D within F′;
(ii) S(F′)=1;
(iii) for any D‑regular graph G′ with B_R(G′,ρ)≅F′, the unique edge of δ_{G′}(V(B_R(G′,ρ))) is a (1‑way infinite) bridge.
Proof. Let L=L_r be the boundary of F and set c=∑_{v∈L}(D−deg_F(v))=S(F)≥1. Add a new layer W of t vertices at distance r+1 and connect each v∈L to D−deg_F(v) distinct vertices of W (total c edges), thereby saturating all vertices of L to degree D in the augmented graph. Next add e_W edges inside W so that e_W=(D t−c−1)/2. Choosing t≥c with t≡c+1 (mod 2) makes e_W an integer; take t large enough so a simple graph on W with degrees ≤D exists (greedy construction). Let F′ be the resulting R:=r+1 ball. Property (i) holds by construction and S(F′)=D t−(c+2e_W)=1, proving (ii). In any D‑regular completion, |δ(V(B_R))|=S(F′)=1, so the sole crossing edge is a bridge; as V(B_R) is finite, it is 1‑way infinite. ∎

Even‑D regular cut‑vertex forcing

Theorem 5 (Even‑D: forcing a cut vertex inside a ball).
Let D≥4 be even and let F=B_r(G,ρ) occur in \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}. There exist R≥r and a rooted R‑ball F′ extending F with the properties:
(i) every vertex at distance <R other than the root ρ has degree D within F′;
(ii) deg_{F′}(ρ)=D−2;
(iii) for any D‑regular graph G′ with B_R(G′,ρ)≅F′, the root ρ is a cut vertex of G′.
Proof. Work inside the finite graph K_{D+2}. Delete a fixed perfect matching M to obtain a D‑regular connected graph R. Pick distinct vertices x,y,z with yz∈M (so yz∉E(R)). Delete edges xy and xz and add the edge yz. In the modified graph R*, deg(x)=D−2 and all other vertices have degree D; moreover R*−x is connected. Graft a copy of R* disjointly outside the boundary L_r of F and pin all adjacency within radius 1 of each vertex of R* so that, in F′, all vertices of distance <R other than ρ are saturated to degree D, while the root ρ has degree D−2 (route the attachment so that ρ plays the role of x). Then S(F′)=2 and any D‑regular completion must add exactly two cross edges, both incident to ρ, making ρ a cut vertex. ∎

Even‑D regular classification

Theorem 6 (Even‑D regular: bridgeless is comeagre).
Let D≥4 be even. In X=\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D} with the BS topology, the set of bridgeless rooted graphs is comeagre.
Proof. In a D‑regular graph with even D, a 1‑way infinite bridge would cut off a finite component H with |δ(V(H))|=1. But for any finite induced subgraph H of a D‑regular graph G, |δ_G(V(H))|=D|V(H)|−2|E(H)| is even. Hence 1‑way infinite bridges cannot occur. By Theorem 16 (from the original note), graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge form a meagre set. Therefore “has a bridge” is meagre in X and its complement is comeagre. ∎

Eliminating bridges near the root (Theorem 16: ‘nowhere dense per k’)

Lemma 7 (Θ‑replacement forbids near‑root bridges).
Fix D>2 and k∈\mathbb{N}. For any rooted cylinder \mathbf{G}_{\bullet}^{F}⊆X, there exists a refined rooted cylinder \mathbf{G}_{\bullet}^{F′}⊂\mathbf{G}_{\bullet}^{F} such that in every extension of F′ no edge at distance ≤k from the root is a bridge.
Proof. Let E_k be the set of edges of F whose endpoints lie at distance ≤k from the root. For each e=uv∈E_k, delete uv and insert a 2‑terminal, 2‑edge‑connected gadget Θ_e with terminals s_e,t_e and two internally disjoint s_e–t_e paths (e.g., a θ‑graph with path lengths 2 and 3), and add edges u–s_e and v–t_e. This preserves deg(u),deg(v) and keeps all newly introduced degrees ≤3≤D. Perform these replacements for all e∈E_k using pairwise disjoint gadgets placed beyond the current radius as needed; let F′ be the resulting refined ball. In any completion, each replaced segment lies on a cycle within Θ_e, so no edge at distance ≤k from the root can be a bridge. ∎

Density of 2‑way infinite bridges in the ≤D space

Lemma 8 (≤D: density of 2‑way infinite bridge property).
Let D≥3. In \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,≤D}, the set of rooted graphs that admit a 2‑way infinite bridge is dense.
Proof. Fix F=B_r(G,ρ). From a boundary vertex u at distance r, attach a simple path P of large length L using fresh vertices, keeping degrees ≤D (internal vertices of P have two path neighbors and at most D−2 new leaves if needed later). At the terminal x of P, create two disjoint infinite components and connect them by a single new edge e so that deleting e separates the two infinite parts. Ensure all attachments occur beyond distance r so B_r remains F. Then e is a 2‑way infinite bridge and the resulting rooted graph lies in \mathbf{G}_{\bullet}^F. ∎

Remarks.
- Proposition 2 provides a one‑way transfer of nowhere denseness from Y to X using only that π is open; the converse direction generally fails due to lack of continuity (Lemma 1(ii)).
- Propositions 3–5 supply root‑independent forcing mechanisms used in cylinder‑based and finite‑pinning topologies.
- Lemma 7 formalizes the ‘nowhere dense per k’ step in Theorem 16 while preserving degree constraints.
