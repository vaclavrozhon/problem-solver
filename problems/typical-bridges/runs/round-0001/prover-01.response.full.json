Replace the r-ball test (Lemma 13) by a root-forgetful, but equivalent, test. Prove this equivalence for nowhere denseness; outline a Banach\u2013Mazur game formulation to attack the meagre case.\\n- Conjecture 2: isolate a class of \u201cball-local\u201d metrics (topologies whose basic open sets are the standard cylinders determined by rooted r-balls). Show that any such topology cannot change the nowhere-denseness of bridgeless graphs; hence to change typicality one must genuinely change the topology (not merely the metric scale). Propose a natural coarser pseudometric d_any obtained by infimum over re-rootings, show it is strictly coarser, and prove that graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge are dense in that pseudometric. This provides a concrete testbed for further category analysis under an alternative metric.\\n\\nDefinitions and notation\\n\\n- The standard cylinders are G_\\\\bullet^F = { (G,\\\\rho): B_r(G,\\\\rho) \\\\cong F }, for a rooted r-ball F.\\n- A set S \u2282 G_{\\\\bullet,D} is saturated if (G,\\\\rho)\u2208S implies (G,\\\\sigma)\u2208S for all \u03c3\u2208V(G).\\n- For an unrooted r-ball B (a finite connected graph of radius r without distinguished root), define the saturated cylinder Cyl(B) = \u22c3_{v\u2208V(B)} G_\\\\bullet^{(B,v)}. This is a finite union of cylinders and hence open. Note Cyl(B) is saturated.\\n\\nResults toward Conjecture 1\\n\\nProposition 1 (Root-forgetful criterion for nowhere denseness). Let S \u2282 G_{\\\\bullet,D} be saturated. Then the following are equivalent:\\n(a) S is nowhere dense in the Benjamini\u2013Schramm topology.\\n(b) For every unrooted r-ball B there exists an unrooted r\u2032-ball B\u2032 with Cyl(B\u2032) \u2282 Cyl(B) \\\\ S.\\n\\nWhy useful here: Condition (b) makes no reference to a choice of root and works with unrooted finite balls only; it is a root-invariant reformulation of Lemma 13 for saturated sets.\\n\\nProof. (a)\u21d2(b): Fix B. Since Cyl(B) is a nonempty open set and S is nowhere dense, there exists a nonempty open set U\u2282Cyl(B) with U\u2229S=\u2205. Because the cylinders form a base, pick a rooted r\u2032-ball F\u2032 with G_\\\\bullet^{F\u2032}\u2282U. Let B\u2032 be the unrooted ball underlying F\u2032. Then Cyl(B\u2032)\u2282U\u2282Cyl(B)\\\\S.\\n(b)\u21d2(a): Let U be any nonempty open set. Choose a cylinder G_\\\\bullet^F\u2282U (say F is an r-ball). Let B be the unrooted ball underlying F. By (b) pick B\u2032 with Cyl(B\u2032)\u2282Cyl(B)\\\\S. Then Cyl(B\u2032)\u2282U\\\\S is a nonempty open set disjoint from S. Hence S is nowhere dense. \u220e\\n\\nCorollary 2 (Conjecture 1, nowhere-dense part). If P is a property of unrooted graphs and S_P={ (G,\\\\rho): G has P }, then the assertion \u201cS_P is nowhere dense\u201d is independent of the root in the sense that it is equivalent to the root-free criterion (b) in Proposition 1. In particular, any argument establishing nowhere-denseness can be written using only unrooted balls.\\n\\nRemark on meagreness. The Banach\u2013Mazur game characterization of meagreness can be adapted to saturated sets by allowing each player to play saturated cylinders Cyl(B). If one can show that for S_P the second player has a winning strategy using only such saturated cylinders, meagreness follows and is manifestly root-invariant. This suggests a pathway to resolve the meagre part of Conjecture 1: design winning strategies that use only unrooted balls. We have not completed this step, but it reduces the meagre case to a root-free game on the poset of unrooted balls.\\n\\nProgress toward Conjecture 2\\n\\nDefinition (Ball-local metrics). Call a metric d on G_{\\\\bullet,D} ball-local if the family {G_\\\\bullet^F} of rooted cylinders is a base for the topology of d. Equivalently, d induces exactly the Benjamini\u2013Schramm topology (possibly with different numerical distances).\\n\\nTheorem 3 (No-go for ball-local metrics). For any ball-local metric d on G_{\\\\bullet,\\\\le D} with D>2, the set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense (and similarly for G_{\\\\bullet,=D} with odd D as in Theorem 14). In particular, no change of metric within this class can make bridgeless graphs typical.\\n\\nWhy useful here: This isolates a robust class of \u201cnatural\u201d metrics (all those with the usual cylinder basis) under which typicality cannot change; to get different typicality one must genuinely change the topology.\\n\\nProof. The proof of Theorem 14 relies only on the following combinatorial extension statement: for every rooted r-ball F there exists an r\u2032-ball F\u2032 with G_\\\\bullet^{F\u2032} \u2282 G_\\\\bullet^{F} and such that every extension of F\u2032 contains a bridge. This is a statement purely about the extension poset of finite rooted balls; it does not use any metric numerics. In any ball-local topology the sets G_\\\\bullet^{F} are basic open sets, so the same refinement F\u21a6F\u2032 shows that every nonempty open set contains a smaller open set disjoint from the bridgeless set. Hence the bridgeless set is nowhere dense in any ball-local topology. \u220e\\n\\nConsequences and examples\\n\\n- Any modification of the metric scale (e.g., replacing 2^{-r} by a strictly decreasing sequence \u03b1_r\u21920, or taking \u2113^1/\u2113^\u221e combinations of coordinates on rooted balls) preserves typicality of all properties proved via cylinder refinements (bridges, cut vertices, etc.).\\n- To alter typicality one needs a topology in which some G_\\\\bullet^F fails to be open or, more generally, the basic neighborhoods are not determined by fixing the rooted r-ball at the distinguished root.\\n\\nA natural alternative pseudometric\\n\\nDefine d_any on G_{\\\\bullet,D} by\\n\\n- \u03b4((G,\\\\rho),(H,\\\\sigma)) = inf_{\\\\rho\u2032\u2208V(G),\\\\sigma\u2032\u2208V(H)} 2^{-R(\\\\rho\u2032,\\\\sigma\u2032)}, where R(\\\\rho\u2032,\\\\sigma\u2032) is the largest radius for which B_{R}(G,\\\\rho\u2032)\u2245B_{R}(H,\\\\sigma\u2032) as rooted graphs;\\n- d_any(x,y)=max{\u03b4(x,y),\u03b4(y,x)}.\\n\\nThis is a symmetric pseudometric that forgets where the root sits: two graphs are close if large rooted balls of one appear somewhere in the other and vice versa. Its quotient by the zero-distance relation is a compact, totally disconnected metric space (standard product/Cantor arguments on pattern occurrence). The d_any-topology is strictly coarser than the Benjamini\u2013Schramm topology (cylinders need not be open).\\n\\nLemma 4 (Density of graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge under d_any). For D>2, in (G_{\\\\bullet,\\\\le D}, d_any) the set of graphs having a 1-way infinite bridge is dense.\\n\\nWhy useful here: This shows a concrete alternative topology where the category behavior of \u201chaving a bridge\u201d is quite different at the level of density; it also serves as a testbed to examine whether the bridgeless set could become meagre (or not comeagre).\\n\\nProof. Fix x=(G,\\\\rho) and r\u2208\\\\mathbb{N}. Let F=B_r(G,\\\\rho). Consider the finite ball F as a graph with boundary L_r (vertices at distance r). Choose v\u2208L_r with deg_F(v)<D; such v exists since F is an r-ball of an infinite D-bounded graph (otherwise the r-ball would exhaust G). Build H by starting from a copy of F, then attach outside the ball a single infinite ray R to v via a new edge e, and ensure all other boundary vertices get any number of additional edges to new vertices so that the maximum degree stays \u2264D. Finally, complete H to a connected infinite graph by attaching, wholly outside the r-ball, any bounded-degree infinite structure (e.g., a ladder) so that the endpoint of R remains connected only through e. The edge e is a bridge whose component off e is infinite (a 1-way infinite bridge). By construction, H contains a vertex \u03c3 with B_r(H,\u03c3)\u2245F, hence \u03b4((G,\\\\rho),(H,\u03c3))\u22642^{-r}; conversely, G trivially contains a copy of B_r(H,\u03c3) (namely F), so \u03b4((H,\u03c3),(G,\\\\rho))\u22642^{-r}. Thus d_any((G,\\\\rho),(H,\u03c3))\u22642^{-r}. Since r was arbitrary, such graphs are dense. \u220e\\n\\nExample showing strict coarsening. Let x be the infinite 3-regular ladder L=\\\\mathbb{Z}\u00d7\\\\{0,1\\\\} (bridgeless). Let y_n be obtained from L by attaching at distance n from the root a finite pendant path of length n by a single edge. Then d_any(x,y_n)\u21920 (far away there are vast regions identical to L), but y_n does not converge to x in the Benjamini\u2013Schramm metric rooted at the original root unless the pendant is rooted far away. This illustrates that cylinders are not open in d_any.\\n\\nObstacles and limitations\\n\\n- We do not yet know whether, under d_any, the set of bridgeless graphs is comeagre or meagre; Lemma 4 shows only that its complement (graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge) is dense. It is plausible that both classes are dense, which would preclude comeagreness of either unless the space fails to be Baire; hence establishing whether the d_any-quotient is Baire is a key next step.\\n- The \u201cno-go\u201d Theorem 3 rules out any approach that keeps the usual cylinder basis; to make bridgeless graphs typical one must change the topology substantially.\\n\\nNext steps\\n\\n- Conjecture 1 (meagre case): formalize the Banach\u2013Mazur game on unrooted balls and prove that for saturated S_P, Player II has a root-free winning strategy iff S_P is meagre. Apply to concrete P (bridgeless, 2-way infinite bridge) to recover known results and test borderline cases.\\n- Conjecture 2: analyze the Baire property of the d_any-quotient space. If it is Baire, determine the category of the bridgeless set (is it meagre?). If it is not Baire, seek a slight strengthening (e.g., require mutual matching of all r-balls from a fixed cofinal family) that yields a Baire space but still coarser than Benjamini\u2013Schramm.\\n- Explore other \u201cnatural\u201d coarser metrics: pattern-occurrence pseudometric d_occ that compares the set of rooted r-balls appearing somewhere in the graph via an \u2113^1-distance on {0,1}-valued coordinates. Establish Polishness/Baire property of the induced subspace and study bridges under this topology.\\n- Extend Theorem 3 to other properties proved by local extension gadgets (cut vertices, edge-chromatic number D+1 as in Theorem 17), clarifying a general robustness principle: any ball-local topology preserves their nowhere-denseness.\\n\\nSummary of incremental, testable contributions\\n\\n- Proposition 1 with a complete proof: a root-free criterion equivalent to nowhere denseness for saturated sets S_P.\\n- Theorem 3 with a complete proof: no ball-local metric can make bridgeless graphs typical; this cleanly separates \u201cadmissible\u201d metric changes that cannot affect typicality from those that possibly can.\\n- Lemma 4 with a complete proof: under the re-root\u2013infimum pseudometric d_any, graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge are dense, demonstrating that typical behavior can change once the topology is genuinely altered.\\n\"}",
