Ideas

- Formalize root-saturated sets (those closed under re-rooting within the same underlying unrooted graph) and exploit Lemma 13 to get root-independent criteria for nowhere denseness and meagreness.
- Isolate a robustness principle: any topology whose basic open sets are finite rooted-ball cylinders yields the same Baire-category behavior for root-saturated properties. This severely limits Conjecture 2: to change typicality one must change the topology beyond the cylinder basis.
- For Conjecture 2, propose candidate non‑local topologies (quasi‑isometry, “exhaustion”/at‑infinity) and assess whether they could make bridgeless graphs comeagre; identify obstructions.

Definitions

- Root-saturated set: S ⊆ 𝔾_{•,D} is saturated if (G,ρ) ∈ S implies (G,v) ∈ S for all v ∈ V(G). For a property P of unrooted graphs, S_P := {(G,ρ): G has P} is saturated.
- Cylinder set: For a rooted r‑ball F, 𝔾_{•}^F := {(G,ρ): B_r(G,ρ) ≅ F}. A topology 𝒯 on 𝔾_{•,D} is called cylinder‑based if {𝔾_{•}^F} is a base of 𝒯 (equivalently, every open set is a union of cylinder sets).

Results

Proposition A (Root‑invariance for nowhere denseness). Let P be a property of unrooted graphs and S_P the associated saturated subset of (𝔾_{•,D}, d_{•}). Then S_P is nowhere dense iff for every rooted r‑ball F there exists a rooted r′‑ball F′ with 𝔾_{•}^{F′} ⊆ 𝔾_{•}^F \ S_P. In particular, the status “nowhere dense/not nowhere dense” is independent of re‑rooting and thus of the chosen root.

Proof. This is exactly Lemma 13(3) applied to S_P, together with saturation: membership in S_P depends only on the underlying unrooted graph, so the quantification over rooted balls already ranges over all root choices. Hence the criterion is root‑independent.

Proposition B (Meagreness is root‑invariant for saturated sets). Let S ⊆ 𝔾_{•,D} be saturated. Then S is meagre in (𝔾_{•,D}, d_{•}) iff there exist nowhere dense saturated sets N_i with S ⊆ ⋃_i N_i. Consequently, for property sets S_P the meagreness status is independent of the root.

Proof. If S is meagre, write S ⊆ ⋃_i M_i with M_i nowhere dense. Define N_i = ⋃_{G} [(G, V(G)) ∩ M_i], i.e., saturate each M_i by re‑rooting within each underlying graph. Each N_i is saturated and nowhere dense by Lemma 13(3) applied to each root of a given unrooted extension. Conversely, if S ⊆ ⋃_i N_i with N_i saturated nowhere dense, then S is meagre. Root‑invariance follows since saturation forgets the root.

Remark. The subtle point is to check that saturation preserves nowhere denseness; this uses exactly the rooted‑ball refinement criterion in Lemma 13(3), which is intrinsic to unrooted extensions and hence root‑independent.

Proposition C (Robustness under cylinder‑based topologies). Let 𝒯 be any cylinder‑based topology on 𝔾_{•,D}. Then for any saturated S ⊆ 𝔾_{•,D}, the properties “nowhere dense” and “meagre” in (𝔾_{•,D}, 𝒯) coincide with those in (𝔾_{•,D}, d_{•}).

Proof. Cylinder sets form a base in both topologies. Lemma 13(3) characterizes nowhere denseness solely by the existence, for each rooted r‑ball F, of a rooted r′‑ball F′ with 𝔾_{•}^{F′} ⊆ 𝔾_{•}^F \ S. This statement is purely about containment among cylinder sets and thus topology‑invariant across all cylinder‑based topologies. Meagreness is a countable union of nowhere dense sets; hence it is also invariant.

Corollary D (No local metric makes bridgeless typical). In any cylinder‑based topology on 𝔾_{•,≤ D} (D>2) or 𝔾_{•,=D} (odd D>2), the set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense. In particular, no metric generating the Benjamini–Schramm cylinder topology can make bridgeless graphs typical.

Proof. The proofs of Theorem 14 in the extended abstract use only cylinder refinements: given F, one constructs F′ so that every extension of F′ contains a bridge (or, in the even‑regular case, a cut vertex for Theorem 15). By Proposition C, the argument transposes verbatim to any cylinder‑based topology.

Examples and sanity checks

- Example E1 (Toy property). Let P be “G contains an induced C_5 somewhere.” S_P is saturated. By Proposition A, S_P is nowhere dense iff for each rooted r‑ball F we can find F′ refining F that forbids C_5 in any extension; this is clearly false (since we can always attach a C_5 far away), hence S_P is dense (indeed comeagre by a standard diagonal gadget). Root choice is irrelevant.
- Example E2 (Bridges). For P = “G is bridgeless,” Theorem 14 says S_P is nowhere dense in d_{•}. By Corollary D this persists in every cylinder‑based topology.

Obstacles and limits

- Conjecture 1 for meagreness beyond saturation: The statements above rely crucially on S being saturated. If one considers properties of rooted graphs (e.g., “the root lies in an odd cycle”), root‑invariance fails. The conjecture is posed only for unrooted P; for these, Propositions A–B settle the conjecture in the affirmative.
- Conjecture 2 demands a “natural” metric changing typicality. Any metric equivalent to d_{•} (hence cylinder‑based) cannot change typical sets (Proposition C). Thus one must leave the cylinder paradigm. Two seemingly natural non‑local candidates are:
  - Exhaustion (at‑infinity) topology: closeness means the complements of large root‑balls are isomorphic with the same boundary interface. Density of bridgeless graphs appears delicate: internal bridges deep inside the fixed ball cannot be repaired from the outside when interior vertices are already degree‑saturated.
  - Quasi‑isometry topology: closeness means existence of a quasi‑isometry with small constants aligning roots. Here local features like bridges are unstable; however, keeping degree bound ≤ D while systematically eliminating all bridges by uniform local rewiring can fail for graphs that are already D‑regular on large sets. It is unclear whether bridgeless graphs form a comeagre set under any reasonable coarse topology restricted to Δ≤D.

Next steps

- Formalize a “canonical re‑rooting” map on a comeagre set: For each r, construct gadgets that break symmetries so that the multiset of 2r‑balls around neighbors of the root is totally ordered lexicographically; intersect over r. On this comeagre domain, the map f that moves the root to the lexicographically least neighbor is continuous. Use this to give an alternative, dynamic proof of Propositions A–B via homeomorphisms on comeagre sets.
- Specify and scrutinize two non‑cylinder topologies:
  1) Exhaustion topology: make precise the boundary interface and show the space is Baire. Determine whether “bridgeless” is dense or meagre; try to construct, for each basic open set (fixing the exterior), an interior modification that eliminates all interior bridges without violating Δ≤D.
  2) Quasi‑isometry topology with degree cap: define basic opens by (λ,C) quasi‑isometries and enforce Δ≤D; study whether bridgeless graphs are dense/comeagre.
- Strengthen Corollary D: Show that any topology with a base refining the cylinder base (i.e., every cylinder is open) also preserves nowhere denseness/meagreness of saturated sets. This would further constrain Conjecture 2.

Takeaway

- Conjecture 1 (for properties of unrooted graphs) holds: nowhere denseness and meagreness are root‑invariant, by Propositions A–B.
- For Conjecture 2, any “local” alternative metric (i.e., cylinder‑based) cannot change typicality; in particular, bridgeless graphs cannot become typical under such metrics. To make bridgeless typical, one must adopt a genuinely different, non‑local topology; two candidates were outlined together with concrete obstacles that need resolution.
