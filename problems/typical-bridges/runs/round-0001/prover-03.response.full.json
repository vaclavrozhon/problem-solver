Hence \\\\pi^{-1}(A) is not meagre, contradiction.\\n\\nConsequences for Conjecture 1\\n- For any property P of unrooted graphs for which T_P is Borel (or merely has the Baire property) in Y, meagreness and nowhere-denseness of S_P in X are equivalent to those of T_P in Y. In particular, smallness is independent of the root in this strong sense.\\n- This covers essentially all \u201cnatural\u201d properties encountered in the extended abstract (bridges, cutvertices, edge-chromatic number, flow obstructions), which are definable in terms of finitary patterns or countable Boolean combinations thereof.\\n\\nExamples/Checks\\n- P = \u201cG has a 2-way infinite bridge.\u201d The set T_P is F_\\\\sigma in Y as a countable union over k of the open sets \u201cthere is a 2-way infinite bridge within distance \u2264k of some vertex.\u201d Hence S_P meagre in X iff T_P meagre in Y (matching Theorem 16 for X).\\n- P = \u201cG is bridgeless.\u201d Its complement is \\\\bigcup_k \\\\{bridge within distance \u2264k\\\\}, i.e., a countable union of open sets, so T_P is G_\\\\delta. Root-invariance of nowhere denseness/meagreness follows as above.\\n\\nConjecture 2: robust obstruction for \u201cbridgeless is typical\u201d under local/pattern-compatible metrics\\nDefinition (pattern-compatible topology on X): A topology \\\\tau on X is pattern-compatible if, for every r-ball F and every k, the set\\nO(F,k) = { (G,\\\\rho): \u2203v at distance \u2264k from \\\\rho with B_r(G,v) \\\\cong F }\\nis open in \\\\tau.\\nExamples: The standard rooted local topology; any metric topologically equivalent to it; the rootless local topology on Y (mutatis mutandis) also enjoys the analogous property.\\n\\nProposition 4 (No-go for \u201cbridgeless is typical\u201d under pattern-compatible topologies on \u2264D spaces)\\nAssume D\u22652 and \\\\tau is pattern-compatible on X. Then the set B of graphs that have a bridge is not meagre in (X,\\\\tau). Consequently, \u201cbridgeless\u201d is not comeagre.\\nProof: Let F be the 1-ball consisting of a single edge with the center (root) of degree 1. Then O(F,0) is a nonempty open set (any one-edge graph glued at the root occurs locally) and every (G,\\\\rho)\u2208O(F,0) has \\\\deg(\\\\rho)=1, so the unique edge incident to \\\\rho is a 1-way infinite bridge. Hence O(F,0)\u2286B, so B has nonempty interior and is not meagre.\\nRemark: This applies to \\\\mathbf{G}_{\\\\bullet,\\\\le D}. For even D in \\\\mathbf{G}_{\\\\bullet,=D}, 1-way bridges are impossible; however, the same obstruction applies to the unrooted version on Y if we replace O(F,0) by its rootless analogue (the set \u201c\u2203 a leaf somewhere\u201d is open and nonempty), so the set of graphs having a bridge remains non-meagre there as well.\\n\\nCorollary 5 (Topological equivalence implies invariance)\\nIf a metric d' on X induces the same topology as d_\\\\bullet, then the collection of typical properties is identical. In particular, no such metric can make \u201cbridgeless\u201d typical.\\n\\nExamples and small tests\\n- Weighted local metrics: d_\\\\alpha((G,\\\\rho),(H,\\\\sigma)) = \\\\sum_{r\\\\ge 0} \\\\alpha_r \\\\mathbf{1}[B_r(G,\\\\rho)\\\\not\\\\cong B_r(H,\\\\sigma)] with \\\\alpha_r>0 and \\\\alpha_r\\\\to 0. These are topologically equivalent to d_\\\\bullet, hence typicality is unchanged.\\n- Pointed Gromov\u2013Hausdorff-type local metrics on bounded-degree graphs are also topologically equivalent to d_\\\\bullet, so typicality is unchanged.\\n\\nObstacles\\n- To make \u201cbridgeless\u201d comeagre, one must use a topology in which the property \u201cthe root has degree 1\u201d (or \u201cthere exists a leaf somewhere\u201d) is not open. This forces a non-local topology (open sets cannot constrain finite balls), which seems at odds with standard graph local-convergence frameworks.\\n- For meagreness equivalence (Conjecture 1) without assuming the Baire property of T_P, the implication S_P meagre \u21d2 T_P meagre may fail for arbitrary continuous open maps in full generality. However, for the saturated preimages we consider and for Baire-property sets (covering all natural P), the equivalence holds.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Formalize Y as a Polish space (e.g., by coding graphs as rooted balls with an anchor erased) and record that T_P is Borel for the properties in the extended abstract; place Proposition 2 and Corollary 3 into proofs.md.\\n- Explore whether any \u201creasonable\u201d alternative metric outside the pattern-compatible class still preserves openness of \u201croot has degree 1.\u201d If so, it cannot make bridgeless typical. Try to axiomatize \u201creasonable\u201d as: Hausdorff, second countable, and containing all cylinder sets U_F^X as sets with the Baire property (preferably open).\\n- For even D in \\\\mathbf{G}_{\\\\bullet,=D}, sharpen the no-go by locating a basic open set contained in \u201chas a 2-way infinite bridge\u201d or, failing that, in \u201chas a cut vertex,\u201d to show these complements cannot be typical under pattern-compatible topologies.\\n- Investigate whether any coarse, global metric (e.g., based on spectral measures at the root) yields a topology where \u201cleaf at the root\u201d is not open, and assess whether such a topology can be considered natural in this context.\\n\"\n}",
