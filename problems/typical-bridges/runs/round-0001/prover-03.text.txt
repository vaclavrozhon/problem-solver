Ideas
- Work with two natural topologies: the rooted local (Benjamini–Schramm) topology on X=\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D} and the “rootless” local topology on Y obtained by forgetting the root and declaring as basic open sets those unrooted graphs that contain a given finite rooted ball somewhere.
- Use the forgetful map \pi:X\to Y that sends (G,\rho) to G. Show \pi is a continuous, open, surjective map. Then transfer smallness (nowhere denseness/meagreness) between X and Y.
- Conjecture 1 (root-invariance): Prove full equivalence for nowhere-dense sets and, for meagreness, prove equivalence for sets having the Baire property (in particular, Borel/analytic sets). This essentially settles the conjecture for all “natural” properties P.
- Conjecture 2 (metric sensitivity): Identify a broad class of “local/pattern-compatible” metrics whose open sets contain all radius-r cylinder sets. Under any such metric, bridgeless graphs cannot be typical; this yields a robust obstruction to making bridgeless graphs comeagre. Conclude that to change typicality one must abandon local/pattern-compatible topologies (which strongly suggests “no” for reasonable alternatives).

Definitions and setup
- X = \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D} with the usual rooted local topology; a basic clopen set is U_F^X = { (G,\rho): B_r(G,\rho) \cong F } for a finite rooted r-ball F.
- Y = set of countably infinite connected unrooted graphs with \Delta\le D, endowed with the rootless local topology generated by basic open sets U_F^Y = { G: ∃v∈V(G) with B_r(G,v) \cong F }.
- Forgetful map \pi: X→Y, \pi(G,\rho)=G.

Lemma 1 (\pi is continuous, open, surjective)
- Continuity: For basic open U_F^Y in Y, \pi^{-1}(U_F^Y)=U_F^X is open in X.
- Openness: For basic open U_F^X in X, \pi(U_F^X)=U_F^Y is open in Y.
- Surjectivity is clear.

Why useful here: Smallness (meagre/nowhere-dense) is purely topological; relating X and Y via an open continuous surjection allows transfer of smallness statements for unrooted properties P.

The rootless formulation of a property P
- For a property P of unrooted graphs, let T_P⊆Y be {G: G has P}, and S_P=\pi^{-1}(T_P)⊆X be { (G,\rho): G has P }. Then S_P is saturated (a union of fibers of \pi) and S_P=\pi^{-1}(T_P).

Proposition 2 (nowhere denseness is root-invariant, for all P)
Claim: For any A⊆Y, A is nowhere dense in Y iff \pi^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X.
Proof: 
- (⇒) Let A be nowhere dense in Y. For any nonempty open U⊆X, \pi(U) is open in Y. Because A is nowhere dense, there is nonempty open V⊆\pi(U) with V∩A=∅. Then U' := U∩\pi^{-1}(V) is nonempty open and U'∩\pi^{-1}(A)=∅. Hence \pi^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense.
- (⇐) Suppose \pi^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense. For any nonempty open W⊆Y, \pi^{-1}(W) is open nonempty in X; there is a nonempty open U'⊆\pi^{-1}(W) with U'∩\pi^{-1}(A)=∅. Then \pi(U') is nonempty open and \pi(U')⊆W, and \pi(U')∩A=∅ (otherwise some x∈U' would map into A). Hence A is nowhere dense.

Corollary 3 (meagreness is root-invariant for properties with the Baire property)
Let A⊆Y have the Baire property (in particular, for A Borel/analytic). Then A is meagre in Y iff \pi^{-1}(A) is meagre in X.
Proof: 
- (⇒) Preimages of meagre sets under continuous maps are meagre.
- (⇐) Suppose \pi^{-1}(A) is meagre but A is not meagre. Because A has the Baire property, ∃ nonempty open V⊆Y such that A∩V is comeagre in V. Then \pi^{-1}(A∩V)=\pi^{-1}(A)∩\pi^{-1}(V) is comeagre in \pi^{-1}(V), a nonempty open subset of X. Hence \pi^{-1}(A) is not meagre, contradiction.

Consequences for Conjecture 1
- For any property P of unrooted graphs for which T_P is Borel (or merely has the Baire property) in Y, meagreness and nowhere-denseness of S_P in X are equivalent to those of T_P in Y. In particular, smallness is independent of the root in this strong sense.
- This covers essentially all “natural” properties encountered in the extended abstract (bridges, cutvertices, edge-chromatic number, flow obstructions), which are definable in terms of finitary patterns or countable Boolean combinations thereof.

Examples/Checks
- P = “G has a 2-way infinite bridge.” The set T_P is F_\sigma in Y as a countable union over k of the open sets “there is a 2-way infinite bridge within distance ≤k of some vertex.” Hence S_P meagre in X iff T_P meagre in Y (matching Theorem 16 for X).
- P = “G is bridgeless.” Its complement is \bigcup_k \{bridge within distance ≤k\}, i.e., a countable union of open sets, so T_P is G_\delta. Root-invariance of nowhere denseness/meagreness follows as above.

Conjecture 2: robust obstruction for “bridgeless is typical” under local/pattern-compatible metrics
Definition (pattern-compatible topology on X): A topology \tau on X is pattern-compatible if, for every r-ball F and every k, the set
O(F,k) = { (G,\rho): ∃v at distance ≤k from \rho with B_r(G,v) \cong F }
is open in \tau.
Examples: The standard rooted local topology; any metric topologically equivalent to it; the rootless local topology on Y (mutatis mutandis) also enjoys the analogous property.

Proposition 4 (No-go for “bridgeless is typical” under pattern-compatible topologies on ≤D spaces)
Assume D≥2 and \tau is pattern-compatible on X. Then the set B of graphs that have a bridge is not meagre in (X,\tau). Consequently, “bridgeless” is not comeagre.
Proof: Let F be the 1-ball consisting of a single edge with the center (root) of degree 1. Then O(F,0) is a nonempty open set (any one-edge graph glued at the root occurs locally) and every (G,\rho)∈O(F,0) has \deg(\rho)=1, so the unique edge incident to \rho is a 1-way infinite bridge. Hence O(F,0)⊆B, so B has nonempty interior and is not meagre.
Remark: This applies to \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}. For even D in \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}, 1-way bridges are impossible; however, the same obstruction applies to the unrooted version on Y if we replace O(F,0) by its rootless analogue (the set “∃ a leaf somewhere” is open and nonempty), so the set of graphs having a bridge remains non-meagre there as well.

Corollary 5 (Topological equivalence implies invariance)
If a metric d' on X induces the same topology as d_\bullet, then the collection of typical properties is identical. In particular, no such metric can make “bridgeless” typical.

Examples and small tests
- Weighted local metrics: d_\alpha((G,\rho),(H,\sigma)) = \sum_{r\ge 0} \alpha_r \mathbf{1}[B_r(G,\rho)\not\cong B_r(H,\sigma)] with \alpha_r>0 and \alpha_r\to 0. These are topologically equivalent to d_\bullet, hence typicality is unchanged.
- Pointed Gromov–Hausdorff-type local metrics on bounded-degree graphs are also topologically equivalent to d_\bullet, so typicality is unchanged.

Obstacles
- To make “bridgeless” comeagre, one must use a topology in which the property “the root has degree 1” (or “there exists a leaf somewhere”) is not open. This forces a non-local topology (open sets cannot constrain finite balls), which seems at odds with standard graph local-convergence frameworks.
- For meagreness equivalence (Conjecture 1) without assuming the Baire property of T_P, the implication S_P meagre ⇒ T_P meagre may fail for arbitrary continuous open maps in full generality. However, for the saturated preimages we consider and for Baire-property sets (covering all natural P), the equivalence holds.

Next steps
- Formalize Y as a Polish space (e.g., by coding graphs as rooted balls with an anchor erased) and record that T_P is Borel for the properties in the extended abstract; place Proposition 2 and Corollary 3 into proofs.md.
- Explore whether any “reasonable” alternative metric outside the pattern-compatible class still preserves openness of “root has degree 1.” If so, it cannot make bridgeless typical. Try to axiomatize “reasonable” as: Hausdorff, second countable, and containing all cylinder sets U_F^X as sets with the Baire property (preferably open).
- For even D in \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}, sharpen the no-go by locating a basic open set contained in “has a 2-way infinite bridge” or, failing that, in “has a cut vertex,” to show these complements cannot be typical under pattern-compatible topologies.
- Investigate whether any coarse, global metric (e.g., based on spectral measures at the root) yields a topology where “leaf at the root” is not open, and assess whether such a topology can be considered natural in this context.
