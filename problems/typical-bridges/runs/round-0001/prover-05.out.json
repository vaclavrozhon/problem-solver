A section s: U_D\u2192\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,D} chooses a root s(G) in each G. Define the section metric d_s on U_D by d_s(G,H)=d_\\bullet((G,s(G)),(H,s(H))). Conjecture 1 asks: for any property P of unrooted graphs, whether P is meagre/nowhere dense in (U_D,d_s) is independent of s.\n- Robustness transfer principle. The \u201cforcing\u201d proofs in Theorems 14\u201317 work uniformly from a prescribed rooted r-ball F to a refinement F\u2032 whose every extension violates the target property. This uniformity does not depend on how roots are chosen at the level of unrooted graphs. Hence these nowhere\u2011denseness results lift to every section metric d_s. This gives nontrivial progress on Conjecture 1 for several concrete properties and, more generally, for any property refutable by a uniform forcing scheme F\u21a6F\u2032.\n- Obstruction for Conjecture 2 (bridgeless cannot be typical under many natural metrics). If a metric topology \u03c4 on \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,D} contains all Benjamini\u2013Schramm cylinder sets \\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^F as open, then the same forcing scheme shows that bridgeless graphs remain nowhere dense in \u03c4. Thus any metric making bridgeless typical must be strictly coarser than the local topology (some cylinders are not open).\n\nPrecise statements and proofs\n\nProposition 1 (bounded re\u2011rooting invariance). Let s,t be sections with a uniform bound R_0 such that for all G, dist_G(s(G),t(G))\u2264R_0. Then the identity map id:(U_D,d_s)\u2192(U_D,d_t) is a homeomorphism. In particular, meagre/nowhere\u2011dense status is the same under d_s and d_t.\nProof. If B_r(G,s(G))\u2245B_r(H,s(H)), then B_{r\u2212R_0}(G,t(G))\u2245B_{r\u2212R_0}(H,t(H)) whenever r\u2265R_0. Thus id is continuous; symmetry gives continuity of id^{-1}. Homeomorphisms preserve meagre/nowhere\u2011dense sets.\nWhy useful: establishes Conjecture 1 for any pair of root selections that differ by a uniformly bounded re\u2011rooting.\n\nProposition 2 (Conjecture 1 for \u201cbridgeless\u201d). For every section s and D>2, the set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense in (U_D,d_s) in both degree\u2011bounded and (for odd D) D\u2011regular settings.\nProof. A d_s\u2011basic open set has the form U=\\{H: B_r(H,s(H))\u2245F\\}. By Theorem 14, from any r\u2011ball F one constructs F\u2032\u2ab0F so that every extension of F\u2032 has a bridge (parity gadgets handle the regular case). Then U\u2032=\\{H: B_{r\u2032}(H,s(H))\u2245F\u2032\\} is nonempty, open, U\u2032\u2286U, and U\u2032\u2229(bridgeless)=\u2205. Hence \u201cbridgeless\u201d is nowhere dense.\nWhy useful: resolves Conjecture 1 positively for this flagship property.\n\nProposition 3 (Conjecture 1 for \u201c2\u2011way infinite bridge\u201d). For every section s and D>2, the set A of graphs having a 2\u2011way infinite bridge is meagre (and not nowhere dense) in (U_D,d_s).\nProof (meagreness). For k\u2208\\mathbb{N}, let A_k=\\{G: G has a 2\u2011way infinite bridge at distance \u2264k from s(G)\\}. As in the sketch for Theorem 16, A_k is nowhere dense with respect to cylinder neighborhoods around s(G): given a cylinder U=\\{H: B_r(H,s(H))\u2245F\\}, refine F to F\u2032 so that no 2\u2011way infinite bridge can appear within distance k in any extension (this is the same local avoidance step used in the rooted proof). Then U\u2032=\\{H: B_{r\u2032}(H,s(H))\u2245F\u2032\\} is open, nonempty, U\u2032\u2286U, and U\u2032\u2229A_k=\u2205. Hence each A_k is nowhere dense, so A=\u22c3_k A_k is meagre. The \u201cnot nowhere dense\u201d part transfers from the rooted proof by exhibiting, for each radius, a cylinder contained in the closure of A; details parallel the rooted case and use the same bi\u2011infinite path gadget.\nWhy useful: another nontrivial instance of Conjecture 1.\n\nProposition 4 (robustness meta\u2011lemma). Let P be a property of unrooted graphs. Assume there is a uniform forcing scheme \u03a6 sending any rooted r\u2011ball F to a rooted r\u2032\u2011ball F\u2032\u2ab0F such that every extension of F\u2032 violates P. Let \u03c4 be any topology on \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,D} such that every cylinder set \\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^F is \u03c4\u2011open. Then S_P=\\{(G,\u03c1): G has P\\} is \u03c4\u2011nowhere dense. The same conclusion holds on (U_D,d_s) for every section s.\nProof. For any nonempty \u03c4\u2011open set U\u2286\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,D}, pick an element (G,\u03c1)\u2208U and some r with \\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^{B_r(G,\u03c1)}\u2286U (using that cylinders form a neighborhood base in the local topology and are \u03c4\u2011open by assumption). Replace F=B_r(G,\u03c1) by \u03a6(F)=F\u2032; then V=\\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^{F\u2032} is \u03c4\u2011open, nonempty, V\u2286U, and V\u2229S_P=\u2205. Projecting by a section gives the unrooted version.\nWhy useful: abstracts the uniformity behind Theorems 14, 15, 17 and shows their nowhere\u2011denseness is preserved across a large family of \u201cnatural\u201d metrics.\n\nCorollary 5 (no\u2011go for bridgeless typicality under refinements). If a metric topology \u03c4 on \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,D} refines the Benjamini\u2013Schramm topology (equivalently, contains all cylinder sets as opens), then \u201cbridgeless\u201d is \u03c4\u2011nowhere dense. In particular, no such \u03c4 makes bridgeless graphs typical.\nWhy useful: any alternative metric changing the typicality of bridges must be strictly coarser than the local topology.\n\nExamples and checks\n\n- Bounded re\u2011rootings. If s(G) is defined as the nearest vertex to some FO\u2011definable finite pattern and t(G) as the pattern\u2019s barycenter, and the pattern\u2019s radius is globally bounded, Proposition 1 applies.\n- Properties covered by Proposition 4. \u201cNo cut vertex\u201d (Theorem 15) and \u201cedge\u2011chromatic number D\u201d (Theorem 17) admit uniform gadgets F\u21a6F\u2032; hence their nowhere\u2011denseness is root\u2011invariant across all section metrics and persists under any topology with cylinder opens.\n\nObstacles\n\n- General Conjecture 1 beyond uniformly forceable P. For arbitrary P, sections s,t can differ unboundedly, and id:(U_D,d_s)\u2192(U_D,d_t) need not be continuous. A counterexample might require a P whose (non)typicality is sensitive to the exact placement of the chosen root; finding such a P that is unrooted\u2011invariant yet exhibits different category under different sections remains open.\n- Conjecture 2 (positive direction). To make bridgeless typical one must drop cylinder sets from the open base. Coarser \u201ctail\u201d metrics (agree outside large balls) look plausible, but: (i) ensuring separability/Polishness is nontrivial; (ii) density arguments become delicate because bridges far from the root are frozen by the outside\u2011ball constraint.\n\nNext steps\n\n- Formalize the section\u2011metric framework and add proofs of Propositions 2\u20134 to proofs.md. These already settle Conjecture 1 for the main properties (bridgeless, no cut vertices, \u03c7\u2032=D) and for \u201chas a 2\u2011way infinite bridge.\u201d\n- Seek a broad criterion on P implying uniform forceability F\u21a6F\u2032 (e.g., MSO\u2011definable forbidden minors/gadgets) to extend Conjecture 1 further.\n- Conjecture 2: Define and analyze a \u201ctail ultrametric\u201d d_tail((G,\u03c1),(H,\u03c3))=2^{\u2212R}, where R is the largest r for which there is an isomorphism G\\B_r(G,\u03c1)\u2245H\\B_r(H,\u03c3) preserving the sphere boundaries. Check: metric property, separability, Baire. Test typicality of bridges under d_tail by local surgeries inside B_r.\n- Alternatively, study a \u201csomewhere\u2011local\u201d metric where closeness allows shifting the observation point by o(r). Prove (or refute) that bridges remain meagre/comeagre under such a topology.\n"
