Ideas

- Formalizing Conjecture 1 via sections. Let U_D be the set of unrooted, connected countable graphs with max degree constraint D. A section s: U_D→\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D} chooses a root s(G) in each G. Define the section metric d_s on U_D by d_s(G,H)=d_\bullet((G,s(G)),(H,s(H))). Conjecture 1 asks: for any property P of unrooted graphs, whether P is meagre/nowhere dense in (U_D,d_s) is independent of s.
- Robustness transfer principle. The “forcing” proofs in Theorems 14–17 work uniformly from a prescribed rooted r-ball F to a refinement F′ whose every extension violates the target property. This uniformity does not depend on how roots are chosen at the level of unrooted graphs. Hence these nowhere‑denseness results lift to every section metric d_s. This gives nontrivial progress on Conjecture 1 for several concrete properties and, more generally, for any property refutable by a uniform forcing scheme F↦F′.
- Obstruction for Conjecture 2 (bridgeless cannot be typical under many natural metrics). If a metric topology τ on \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D} contains all Benjamini–Schramm cylinder sets \mathbf{G}_\bullet^F as open, then the same forcing scheme shows that bridgeless graphs remain nowhere dense in τ. Thus any metric making bridgeless typical must be strictly coarser than the local topology (some cylinders are not open).

Precise statements and proofs

Proposition 1 (bounded re‑rooting invariance). Let s,t be sections with a uniform bound R_0 such that for all G, dist_G(s(G),t(G))≤R_0. Then the identity map id:(U_D,d_s)→(U_D,d_t) is a homeomorphism. In particular, meagre/nowhere‑dense status is the same under d_s and d_t.
Proof. If B_r(G,s(G))≅B_r(H,s(H)), then B_{r−R_0}(G,t(G))≅B_{r−R_0}(H,t(H)) whenever r≥R_0. Thus id is continuous; symmetry gives continuity of id^{-1}. Homeomorphisms preserve meagre/nowhere‑dense sets.
Why useful: establishes Conjecture 1 for any pair of root selections that differ by a uniformly bounded re‑rooting.

Proposition 2 (Conjecture 1 for “bridgeless”). For every section s and D>2, the set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense in (U_D,d_s) in both degree‑bounded and (for odd D) D‑regular settings.
Proof. A d_s‑basic open set has the form U=\{H: B_r(H,s(H))≅F\}. By Theorem 14, from any r‑ball F one constructs F′⪰F so that every extension of F′ has a bridge (parity gadgets handle the regular case). Then U′=\{H: B_{r′}(H,s(H))≅F′\} is nonempty, open, U′⊆U, and U′∩(bridgeless)=∅. Hence “bridgeless” is nowhere dense.
Why useful: resolves Conjecture 1 positively for this flagship property.

Proposition 3 (Conjecture 1 for “2‑way infinite bridge”). For every section s and D>2, the set A of graphs having a 2‑way infinite bridge is meagre (and not nowhere dense) in (U_D,d_s).
Proof (meagreness). For k∈\mathbb{N}, let A_k=\{G: G has a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance ≤k from s(G)\}. As in the sketch for Theorem 16, A_k is nowhere dense with respect to cylinder neighborhoods around s(G): given a cylinder U=\{H: B_r(H,s(H))≅F\}, refine F to F′ so that no 2‑way infinite bridge can appear within distance k in any extension (this is the same local avoidance step used in the rooted proof). Then U′=\{H: B_{r′}(H,s(H))≅F′\} is open, nonempty, U′⊆U, and U′∩A_k=∅. Hence each A_k is nowhere dense, so A=⋃_k A_k is meagre. The “not nowhere dense” part transfers from the rooted proof by exhibiting, for each radius, a cylinder contained in the closure of A; details parallel the rooted case and use the same bi‑infinite path gadget.
Why useful: another nontrivial instance of Conjecture 1.

Proposition 4 (robustness meta‑lemma). Let P be a property of unrooted graphs. Assume there is a uniform forcing scheme Φ sending any rooted r‑ball F to a rooted r′‑ball F′⪰F such that every extension of F′ violates P. Let τ be any topology on \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D} such that every cylinder set \mathbf{G}_\bullet^F is τ‑open. Then S_P=\{(G,ρ): G has P\} is τ‑nowhere dense. The same conclusion holds on (U_D,d_s) for every section s.
Proof. For any nonempty τ‑open set U⊆\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}, pick an element (G,ρ)∈U and some r with \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{B_r(G,ρ)}⊆U (using that cylinders form a neighborhood base in the local topology and are τ‑open by assumption). Replace F=B_r(G,ρ) by Φ(F)=F′; then V=\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F′} is τ‑open, nonempty, V⊆U, and V∩S_P=∅. Projecting by a section gives the unrooted version.
Why useful: abstracts the uniformity behind Theorems 14, 15, 17 and shows their nowhere‑denseness is preserved across a large family of “natural” metrics.

Corollary 5 (no‑go for bridgeless typicality under refinements). If a metric topology τ on \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D} refines the Benjamini–Schramm topology (equivalently, contains all cylinder sets as opens), then “bridgeless” is τ‑nowhere dense. In particular, no such τ makes bridgeless graphs typical.
Why useful: any alternative metric changing the typicality of bridges must be strictly coarser than the local topology.

Examples and checks

- Bounded re‑rootings. If s(G) is defined as the nearest vertex to some FO‑definable finite pattern and t(G) as the pattern’s barycenter, and the pattern’s radius is globally bounded, Proposition 1 applies.
- Properties covered by Proposition 4. “No cut vertex” (Theorem 15) and “edge‑chromatic number D” (Theorem 17) admit uniform gadgets F↦F′; hence their nowhere‑denseness is root‑invariant across all section metrics and persists under any topology with cylinder opens.

Obstacles

- General Conjecture 1 beyond uniformly forceable P. For arbitrary P, sections s,t can differ unboundedly, and id:(U_D,d_s)→(U_D,d_t) need not be continuous. A counterexample might require a P whose (non)typicality is sensitive to the exact placement of the chosen root; finding such a P that is unrooted‑invariant yet exhibits different category under different sections remains open.
- Conjecture 2 (positive direction). To make bridgeless typical one must drop cylinder sets from the open base. Coarser “tail” metrics (agree outside large balls) look plausible, but: (i) ensuring separability/Polishness is nontrivial; (ii) density arguments become delicate because bridges far from the root are frozen by the outside‑ball constraint.

Next steps

- Formalize the section‑metric framework and add proofs of Propositions 2–4 to proofs.md. These already settle Conjecture 1 for the main properties (bridgeless, no cut vertices, χ′=D) and for “has a 2‑way infinite bridge.”
- Seek a broad criterion on P implying uniform forceability F↦F′ (e.g., MSO‑definable forbidden minors/gadgets) to extend Conjecture 1 further.
- Conjecture 2: Define and analyze a “tail ultrametric” d_tail((G,ρ),(H,σ))=2^{−R}, where R is the largest r for which there is an isomorphism G\B_r(G,ρ)≅H\B_r(H,σ) preserving the sphere boundaries. Check: metric property, separability, Baire. Test typicality of bridges under d_tail by local surgeries inside B_r.
- Alternatively, study a “somewhere‑local” metric where closeness allows shifting the observation point by o(r). Prove (or refute) that bridges remain meagre/comeagre under such a topology.
