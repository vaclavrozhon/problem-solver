  "summary_md": "Last round settled Conjecture 1: smallness is root\u2011invariant. Using the forgetful map \u03c0:X\u2192Y (continuous, open, surjective) we proved that for any unrooted property P, S_P is nowhere dense in the rooted Benjamini\u2013Schramm space iff its unrooted image is nowhere dense; meagreness is equivalent for sets with the Baire property (hence for natural Borel/analytic properties). For Conjecture 2 we proved a strong no\u2011go: any metric whose basic opens are the rooted cylinders induces the same topology as d_\u2022, so typicality cannot change under such metrics. We also proposed a coarser re\u2011rooting\u2013insensitive topology (bidirectional r\u2011appearance, \u201cd_any\u201d) in which 1\u2011way infinite\u2011bridge graphs are dense; the Baire/typicality status of bridgeless vs. bridged sets there remains open. Technical fixes remain (D\u2011regular parity gadget) and several formalizations are pending.",
