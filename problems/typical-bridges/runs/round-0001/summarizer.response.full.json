For Conjecture 2, we proved that any topology whose basic opens are rooted cylinders equals the Benjamini\u2013Schramm topology, indicating metrics can't change typicality. We proposed a coarser topology (d_any) where graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge may allow typicality changes. Additional notes include necessary corrections to the D-regular parity gadget. \n\nI\u2019ll cite: \"Sources: \u0160\u00e1mal & Zamani (EUROCOMB'25 extended abstract); round Working Log / Proofs.\"",

Using the forgetful map \u03c0:X\u2192Y (continuous, open, surjective) we proved that for any unrooted property P, S_P is nowhere dense in the rooted Benjamini\u2013Schramm space iff its unrooted image is nowhere dense; meagreness is equivalent for sets with the Baire property (hence for natural Borel/analytic properties). For Conjecture 2 we proved a strong no\u2011go: any metric whose basic opens are the rooted cylinders induces the same topology as d_\u2022, so typicality cannot change under such metrics. We also proposed a coarser re\u2011rooting\u2013insensitive topology (bidirectional r\u2011appearance, \u201cd_any\u201d) in which 1\u2011way infinite\u2011bridge graphs are dense; the Baire/typicality status of bridgeless vs. bridged sets there remains open.
