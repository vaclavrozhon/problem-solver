Last round settled Conjecture 1: smallness is root‑invariant. Using the forgetful map π:X→Y (continuous, open, surjective) we proved that for any unrooted property P, S_P is nowhere dense in the rooted Benjamini–Schramm space iff its unrooted image is nowhere dense; meagreness is equivalent for sets with the Baire property (hence for natural Borel/analytic properties). For Conjecture 2 we proved a strong no‑go: any metric whose basic opens are the rooted cylinders induces the same topology as d_•, so typicality cannot change under such metrics. We also proposed a coarser re‑rooting–insensitive topology (bidirectional r‑appearance, “d_any”) in which 1‑way infinite‑bridge graphs are dense; the Baire/typicality status of bridgeless vs. bridged sets there remains open. Technical fixes remain (D‑regular parity gadget) and several formalizations are pending.
