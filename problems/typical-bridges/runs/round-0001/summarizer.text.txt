{"summary_md":"Last round settled Conjecture 1: smallness is root‑invariant. Using the forgetful map π:X→Y (continuous, open, surjective) we proved that for any unrooted property P, S_P is nowhere dense in the rooted Benjamini–Schramm space iff its unrooted image is nowhere dense; meagreness is equivalent for sets with the Baire property (hence for natural Borel/analytic properties). For Conjecture 2 we proved a strong no‑go: any metric whose basic opens are the rooted cylinders induces the same topology as d_•, so typicality cannot change under such metrics. We also proposed a coarser re‑rooting–insensitive topology (bidirectional r‑appearance, “d_any”) in which 1‑way infinite‑bridge graphs are dense; the Baire/typicality status of bridgeless vs. bridged sets there remains open. Technical fixes remain (D‑regular parity gadget) and several formalizations are pending.","highlights":["Conjecture 1 resolved: S_P nowhere dense in rooted space ⇔ unrooted image nowhere dense; meagreness transfers for Baire‑property sets.","Core tool: forgetful map π:X→Y is continuous, open and surjective, enabling category transfer.","No‑go: any topology with rooted cylinders as a base equals d_•, so cylinder‑based metric changes cannot alter typicality.","Coarser re‑rooting‑insensitive topology (d_any) constructed; in it 1‑way infinite‑bridge graphs are dense (so category behavior can differ).","Section/choice metrics with uniformly bounded re‑rooting are homeomorphic, hence preserve typicality.","Technical gap: the =D (odd) parity/regular gadget needs repair to complete the D‑regular arguments.","Sources: Šámal & Zamani (EUROCOMB’25 extended abstract) and this round’s Working log / Proofs files."],"next_questions":["Formalize the re‑rooting‑insensitive topology (precise definition of d_any), prove whether it is a Baire space, and classify the category of \"bridgeless\" and \"has a 1‑way infinite bridge\" therein.","Construct and verify a pinned D‑regular parity gadget for the =D (odd) case and integrate it into the nowhere‑dense proofs.","Write up the π‑based proofs in proofs.md and extend the meagreness transfer statements cleanly to the intended class of Borel/analytic properties."]}
