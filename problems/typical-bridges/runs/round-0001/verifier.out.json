  "feedback_md": "Overall, there is solid progress on Conjecture 1 and a useful negative direction for Conjecture 2. Key points to keep/develop and issues to fix:\n\n- Root-invariance (nowhere-dense): Prover 1\u2019s Proposition 1 is correct and essentially a root-free restatement of Lemma 13 for saturated sets S_P. Prover 3\u2019s \u03c0: X\u2192Y (forgetful) framework gives a fully rigorous transfer: A\u2286Y is nowhere dense iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X; this settles the root-invariance of nowhere-denseness for all unrooted P. This is strong and clean; we should adopt this as the main line and place it in proofs.md.\n\n- Root-invariance (meagre): Prover 3\u2019s Corollary 3 is correct: for A with the Baire property (in particular, Borel/analytic), meagreness of A in Y is equivalent to meagreness of \u03c0^{-1}(A) in X. This resolves Conjecture 1 for all \u201cnatural\u201d graph properties P (bridges, cut vertices, edge-chromatic constraints, etc.). Prover 2\u2019s Proposition B claims that \u201csaturation preserves nowhere denseness\u201d in general; this is suspect. Saturating a nowhere dense set can be dense meagre (e.g., like Q in R), so we cannot conclude it remains nowhere dense. Please retract/repair this and instead use the \u03c0-map argument.\n\n- \u201cBall-local/cylinder-based\u201d metrics: Several provers (1,2,3,5) argue that any metric with the same cylinder base as d_\u2022 yields the same topology, hence identical Baire-category outcomes. Correct\u2014this reduces to topological equivalence, so the proofs of Theorems 14\u201317 transfer verbatim. Prover 4\u2019s FLP class further extends the no-go region; the \u2264D case looks fine. However, the =D odd case has a flaw: constructing a finite D-regular gadget with a bridge by simply adding an edge between two D-regular graphs breaks regularity at the endpoints. A corrected gadget must pin all radius-1 neighborhoods and ensure degrees exactly D while making e* the unique interconnection; parity bookkeeping similar to the extended abstract (or a carefully designed regular \u201cbridge gadget\u201d) is needed. Please fix this construction.\n\n- Alternative/coarser topologies (Conjecture 2): Prover 1\u2019s d_any (inf over re-rootings in both directions) is a natural coarser, root-insensitive candidate. The density lemma for 1-way infinite bridges under d_any is convincing and correctly argued. However, triangle inequality/topological properties of the quotient are not established; avoid claiming compact/Polish without proof. Next step: characterize the induced topology (Baire or not), then determine category of bridgeless vs. bridgeful sets.\n\nConcrete next steps:\n- Move Prover 3\u2019s \u03c0-map lemmas (ND equivalence, meagreness for Baire-property sets) to proofs.md; these essentially settle Conjecture 1 for all natural P.\n- Repair Prover 4\u2019s D-regular gadget or, alternatively, cite/paraphrase the parity-gadget forcing of Theorem 14(ii) to extend FLP no-go to =D odd rigorously.\n- For Conjecture 2, analyze the Baire property and basic open neighborhoods under d_any (or a similarly \u201crootless local\u201d topology). Show whether both bridgeless and \u201chas a 1-way infinite bridge\u201d are dense; if the space is Baire, this precludes either being comeagre.\n- Add bounded re-rooting equivalence (Prover 5) to proofs.md; it\u2019s a clean tool for section metrics.\n- Avoid claims that saturation preserves nowhere-denseness (Prover 2); rephrase using \u03c0.\n",
  "summary_md": "We settled Conjecture 1 for nowhere-denseness via a clean rootless\u2013rooted transfer: the forgetful map \u03c0 from rooted to unrooted spaces is continuous and open, and A\u2286Y is nowhere dense iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense. For meagreness, the same equivalence holds for sets with the Baire property (hence for all natural properties P). For Conjecture 2, we proved robust \u201cno-go\u201d results: any metric with the same cylinder base as d_\u2022 (and more generally many local FLP metrics) preserves the nowhere-denseness of bridgeless graphs. We proposed a coarser re-rooting\u2013insensitive topology (d_any) and proved that graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge are dense there; the Baire status and typicality remain open. One construction in the D-regular case (Prover 4) needs correction; adopt parity gadgets instead.

Use the \u03c0-map, not saturation, for meagreness arguments.\n\n2) No-go regimes for Conjecture 2\n- Any metric/topology whose basic opens are exactly the rooted cylinders G_{\\bullet}^F yields the same topology as d_\u2022; typicality (meagre/comeagre) is unchanged. This covers all \u201cball-local/cylinder-based\u201d metrics and many FLP (finite-lens) variants where opens depend on finitely many finite neighborhoods.\n- FLP extension: In \u2264D spaces, one can force a leaf inside any FLP-open neighborhood (pin a radius-1 neighborhood of a new vertex z with deg(z)=1), hence the bridgeless set is nowhere dense. For =D odd, a parity/degree-pinned bridge gadget is needed (parity bookkeeping as in the abstract). The naive \u201cconnect two D-regular graphs by one edge\u201d breaks regularity\u2014must fix this.\n\n3) Candidate coarser topology for Conjecture 2\n- Re-rooting\u2013insensitive closeness: x and y are r-close if each contains some rooted r-ball isomorphic to a rooted r-ball of the other. Define d_any heuristically by the largest r with this bidirectional r-appearance. Under this coarser, rootless-local proximity, graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge are dense: starting from any r-ball F, attach a pendant infinite ray outside F and complete the rest away from F. This shows that density behavior changes once re-rooting is allowed.\n- Open tasks: (i) Make the induced topology precise and verify Baire property; (ii) Determine the category of \u2018bridgeless\u2019 and \u2018has a 1-way infinite bridge\u2019. If both are dense in a Baire space, neither is comeagre.\n\n4) Section metrics on unrooted space\n- For a section s selecting a root in each unrooted graph, define a local metric d_s via (G,H) \u21a6 d_\u2022( (G,s(G)), (H,s(H)) ). If s,t differ by uniformly bounded root moves, the identity is a homeomorphism (bounded re-rooting equivalence). Local forcing arguments (as in Theorem 14) show \u2018bridgeless\u2019 remains nowhere dense for every section metric.\n\n5) Action items\n- Move \u03c0-based proofs (nowhere-dense equivalence; meagreness for Baire sets) into proofs.md.\n- Repair the =D odd FLP construction by using a fully pinned D-regular bridge gadget (or reintroduce parity gadgets) and document the argument.\n- Formalize the topology behind d_any (Polish/Baire?) and analyze the category of bridge-related properties therein.\n- For \u20182-way infinite bridge\u2019 across section metrics, fill in the \u2018not nowhere dense\u2019 part via explicit dense sets built by bi-infinite path gadgets.\n"

Then:\n(i) \u03c0 is continuous: For any basic open U_F^Y, \u03c0^{-1}(U_F^Y) = U_F^X is open.\n(ii) \u03c0 is open: For any basic open U_F^X, \u03c0(U_F^X) = U_F^Y is open.\n(iii) \u03c0 is surjective.\nProof. (i) and (ii) follow directly from definitions. (iii) is trivial since every unrooted graph admits a root.\n\nTheorem 2 (Nowhere-dense transfer between Y and X).\nFor any A \u2286 Y, A is nowhere dense in Y if and only if \u03c0^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X.\nProof. (\u21d2) Let U\u2286X be nonempty open. Then \u03c0(U) is open in Y by Lemma 1(ii). Since A is nowhere dense, there exists nonempty open V\u2286\u03c0(U) with V\u2229A=\u2205. Then U\u2032 := U \u2229 \u03c0^{-1}(V) is nonempty open and U\u2032 \u2229 \u03c0^{-1}(A) = \u2205. Hence \u03c0^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense.\n(\u21d0) Let W\u2286Y be nonempty open. Then \u03c0^{-1}(W) is nonempty open in X by Lemma 1(i). Since \u03c0^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense, there exists nonempty open U\u2032 \u2286 \u03c0^{-1}(W) with U\u2032 \u2229 \u03c0^{-1}(A) = \u2205. Then \u03c0(U\u2032) is nonempty open with \u03c0(U\u2032) \u2286 W (by Lemma 1(ii)) and \u03c0(U\u2032) \u2229 A = \u2205 (otherwise some x\u2208U\u2032 maps into A). Hence A is nowhere dense.\n\nCorollary 3 (Meagreness transfer for sets with the Baire property).\nLet A \u2286 Y have the Baire property. Then A is meagre in Y iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) is meagre in X.\nProof. (\u21d2) Preimages of meagre sets under continuous maps are meagre. (\u21d0) Suppose \u03c0^{-1}(A) is meagre but A is not meagre. Since A has the Baire property, there exists nonempty open V\u2286Y such that A\u2229V is comeagre in V. Then \u03c0^{-1}(A\u2229V) = \u03c0^{-1}(A) \u2229 \u03c0^{-1}(V) is comeagre in \u03c0^{-1}(V), which is a nonempty open subset of X by Lemma 1(i). Thus \u03c0^{-1}(A) is not meagre, a contradiction.\n\nProposition 4 (Root-free criterion for nowhere-denseness in X for saturated sets).\nLet S \u2286 X be saturated (i.e., re-rooting within a fixed unrooted graph preserves membership). Then S is nowhere dense in X if and only if for every unrooted r-ball B there exists an unrooted r\u2032-ball B\u2032 with Cyl(B\u2032) \u2286 Cyl(B) \\ S, where Cyl(B) := \u22c3_{v\u2208V(B)} U_{(B,v)}^X.\nProof. Let T := \u03c0(S) \u2286 Y. Since S is saturated, S = \u03c0^{-1}(T). By Theorem 2, S is nowhere dense in X iff T is nowhere dense in Y. Applying the standard cylinder refinement characterization of nowhere denseness in Y (identical to Lemma 13(3), but with unrooted cylinders U_{(B,v)}^Y aggregated over v), we obtain the stated root-free criterion.\n\nProposition 5 (Topological invariance across cylinder-based metrics).\nLet \u03c4 be any topology on X for which the family of rooted cylinders {U_F^X} is a base. Then \u03c4 coincides with the Benjamini\u2013Schramm topology, and for any S \u2286 X the properties \u201cnowhere dense\u201d and \u201cmeagre\u201d are the same under \u03c4 and under the standard topology.\nProof. If {U_F^X} is a base, the topology it generates is the smallest topology containing all cylinders; this is precisely the standard topology. Hence \u03c4 equals the standard topology, and Baire-category notions coincide.\n\nProposition 6 (Bounded re-rooting yields homeomorphism of section metrics).\nLet U_D be the set of unrooted graphs with degree constraint D, and s,t be two sections (root choices) with sup_G dist_G(s(G), t(G)) \u2264 R_0 < \u221e. Equip U_D with d_s(G,H) := d_\u2022((G,s(G)), (H,s(H))) and d_t analogously. Then id: (U_D, d_s) \u2192 (U_D, d_t) is a homeomorphism. In particular, nowhere-dense/meagre sets are preserved.\nProof. If B_r(G,s(G)) \u2245 B_r(H,s(H)), then B_{r\u2212R_0}(G,t(G)) \u2245 B_{r\u2212R_0}(H,t(H)) when r \u2265 R_0. This gives continuity both ways.\n\nLemma 7 (Density of graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge under re-rooting\u2013insensitive local closeness).\nFix D \u2265 2. For any (G,\u03c1)\u2208X and r\u2208\u2115, there exists (H,\u03c3) with \u0394(H)\u2264D such that:\n(i) B_r(H,\u03c3) \u2245 B_r(G,\u03c1);\n(ii) H contains a 1-way infinite bridge.\nConsequently, in any topology where basic neighborhoods of (G,\u03c1) include all graphs containing a rooted copy of B_r(G,\u03c1) somewhere (and symmetrically in the other direction), the set of graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge is dense.\nProof. Let F := B_r(G,\u03c1). Since G is infinite, there exists a boundary vertex v\u2208V(F) (dist_F(v,\u03c1)=r) that has a neighbor in G\\V(F). Hence deg_F(v) < deg_G(v) \u2264 D. Build H by taking a copy of F and, outside F, adding a new vertex z adjacent only to v and attaching to z an infinite ray (z=w_0,w_1,w_2,\u2026). For every other boundary vertex u of F, if desired, add new neighbors and finite trees outside F to keep \u0394(H)\u2264D and ensure connectivity of H beyond F. Let \u03c3 be the copy of \u03c1 in H. Then (i) holds by construction. The edge vz is a bridge in H and the component containing the ray is infinite, so (ii) holds.\n\nRemarks.\n- Proposition 4 and Theorem 2 together settle Conjecture 1 for nowhere denseness (root-invariant) and for meagreness for all Baire-property properties P of unrooted graphs (in particular, Borel P).\n- Proposition 5 formalizes the no-go for \u201cball-local\u201d or \u201ccylinder-based\u201d alternative metrics: typicality cannot change.\n- Lemma 7 provides a concrete density phenomenon in a coarser, re-rooting\u2013insensitive setting, motivating further analysis of Baire/totypicality there.\n"
