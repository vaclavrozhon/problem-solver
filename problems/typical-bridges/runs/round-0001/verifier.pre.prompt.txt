# Open Problem: Resolve the Final Two Conjectures on Typical Properties of Countable Graphs

This note poses two conjectures extracted from the extended abstract **“Typical properties of countable graphs: flows and bridges (extended abstract)”** by Robert Šámal and Hadi Zamani (EUROCOMB’25). We first state the setting precisely and then formulate the conjectures. The authors’ extended abstract (lightly re‑typeset) follows afterward for context.

---

## Setting

- Fix an integer \(D \ge 2\).
- Let \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) be the space of **countably infinite, connected, rooted graphs** \((G,\rho)\).
- For \((G,\rho) \in \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) and \(r \in \mathbb{N}\), let \(B_r(G,\rho)\) denote the rooted (closed) ball of radius \(r\) about \(\rho\).
- Equip \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) with the **local (Benjamini–Schramm) metric** \(d_\bullet\) given by
  \[
  d_\bullet\big((G,\rho),(H,\sigma)\big)=2^{-R},
  \qquad
  R=\sup\{r\in\mathbb{N} : B_r(G,\rho)\cong B_r(H,\sigma)\}.
  \]
  (Equivalently, \(d_\bullet((G,\rho),(H,\sigma))<2^{-r}\) iff \(B_r(G,\rho)\cong B_r(H,\sigma)\).)
- Degree‑constrained subspaces:
  - \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\): all rooted graphs with \(\Delta(G)\le D\).
  - \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,= D}\): all rooted graphs with \(\Delta(G)= D\).
  We write \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for either of these when the distinction is unimportant.
- A subset \(S\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) is **nowhere dense** if the interior of \(\overline{S}\) is empty. A set is **meagre** (first category) if it is a countable union of nowhere dense sets; its complement is **comeagre**. A property is called **typical** if the corresponding set is comeagre.
- An edge \(e\) of an (unrooted) graph \(G\) is a **bridge** if \(G-e\) has more connected components than \(G\). A bridge is **2‑way infinite** if both components are infinite and **1‑way infinite** otherwise.

## Conjectures

### Conjecture 1 — Root‑invariance of smallness
Let \(P\) be any property of unrooted graphs and put
\[
S_P=\{(G,\rho)\in \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}: G\text{ has }P\}.
\]
Whether \(S_P\) is **nowhere dense** (respectively, **meagre**) in \((\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D},d_\bullet)\) **does not depend on the choice of the root** \(\rho\).

### Conjecture 2 — Metric sensitivity of typicality
There exists a **natural alternative metric** on the same underlying set \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for which the collection of **typical properties** differs from those under \(d_\bullet\). In particular, determine whether there is a reasonable metric in which **bridgeless graphs are typical**, or prove that no such metric can change their typicality.

### Typical properties of countable graphs: flows and bridges  
*(Extended abstract)*  

**Robert Šámal**\* · **Hadi Zamani**\*

#### Abstract
We have two aims. **First**, we study nowhere‑zero flows in countably infinite graphs, observing the different roles of two types of bridges. **Second**, we study how typical graphs with these types of bridges are. As there is no natural probability measure to use, we turn to an analytic approach: we study which sets are nowhere dense and which are meagre.

In finite graphs, bridges play a crucial role—it is easy to see that every flow assigns value \(0\) to every bridge. It is also known that graphs with a bridge are not typical: both dense random graphs and random regular graphs are bridgeless w.h.p. [3, 1]. We ask how this transfers to countable graphs. In Section 1 we explain differences between bridges and flows and, via compactness, we prove a version of Seymour’s 6‑flow theorem for countable graphs.

In Section 2 we explore nowhere‑dense and meagre sets. This is called for because the usual probabilistic models collapse: extending Erdős–Rényi to countably infinite graphs yields the Rado graph a.s., so we are effectively studying a single graph up to isomorphism. Attempting random regular graphs via the configuration model [1] would require a uniform distribution on perfect matchings of a countable set (e.g., neighbors of the first vertex), which does not exist. Consequently, we turn to Baire category: meagre/co‑meagre sets (also “first/second category”).

### 1. Nowhere‑zero flows for infinite graphs

**Definition 1 (weak flow).**  
Given an orientation \(D\) of a graph \(G\) and an abelian group \(A\), a **weak \(A\)‑flow** is a function \(\varphi:E(G)\to A\) such that **Kirchhoff’s law for each vertex cut** holds:
\[
\forall v\in V(G):\quad \sum_{e\in \delta^-(v)}\varphi(e)=\sum_{e\in \delta^+(v)}\varphi(e).
\]

**Definition 2 (strong flow).**  
Given \(D,G,A\) as above, a **strong \(A\)‑flow** is a function \(\varphi:E(G)\to A\) such that **Kirchhoff’s law for each cut** holds:
\[
\forall S\subseteq V(G):\quad \sum_{e\in \delta^+(S)}\varphi(e)=\sum_{e\in \delta^-(S)}\varphi(e).
\]

In either case, \(\varphi\) is a **nowhere‑zero** weak/strong \(A\)‑flow if \(\varphi^{-1}(0)=\varnothing\).

**Definition 3 (bridge).**  
An edge \(e\) of \(G\) is a **bridge** if deleting \(e\) increases the number of connected components. A bridge is **2‑way infinite** if both resulting components are infinite, and **1‑way infinite** otherwise.

Every strong flow is a weak flow. While the two notions are equivalent on finite graphs, they diverge on infinite graphs: e.g., on a two‑way infinite path, a nowhere‑zero weak \(A\)‑flow exists but a strong one does not. In [6] the authors construct a 3‑connected graph with two ends that admits a nowhere‑zero weak \(A\)‑flow but no nowhere‑zero strong \(A\)‑flow. Nearly all finite flow theorems extend to infinite **strong** \(A\)‑flows via topological compactness; here we use **logical** compactness to obtain:

**Theorem 4.**  
*A countably infinite, locally finite graph without a 1‑way infinite bridge has a nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow.*

---

### 2. Metric space of rooted connected graphs

Since no good probability measure exists for countable graphs, we study typicality via a metric topology and Baire category.

**Definition 5 (ε‑neighborhood).**  
For a metric space \((X,d)\) and \(x\in X\), the ε‑neighborhood is \(U_\varepsilon(x)=\{y\in X:\ d(x,y)<\varepsilon\}\). The closed neighborhood \(\overline{U}_\varepsilon(x)\) uses \(d(x,y)\le \varepsilon\).

**Definition 6 (open set).**  
A set \(U\subseteq X\) is open if \(\forall x\in U\ \exists \varepsilon>0:\ U_\varepsilon(x)\subseteq U\).

We now fix the graph space and metric.

**Definition 9 (space of rooted graphs).**  
Let \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) be the set of all connected rooted graphs (up to root‑preserving isomorphism). For \(D>2\), let \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) be those with all degrees \(\le D\), and \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) those with all degrees \(=D\).

**Definition 10 (r‑ball).**  
For \((G,v)\), the rooted r‑ball is
\[
B_r(G,v)=(\,G[\{y\in V(G): d(v,y)\le r\}],\,v\,).
\]

**Definition 11 (metric \(d_\bullet\)).**  
For \((G_1,v_1),(G_2,v_2)\in\mathbf{G}_\bullet\),
\[
d_\bullet\big((G_1,v_1),(G_2,v_2)\big)=\inf\{2^{-r} : B_r(G_1,v_1)\cong B_r(G_2,v_2)\}.
\]
This is a metric [5].

**Definition 12 (extensions of an r‑ball).**  
For an r‑ball \(F=B_r(G,v)\), define
\[
\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F=\{(G',v')\in \mathbf{G}_\bullet : B_r(G',v')\cong F\}.
\]

**Lemma 13 (basic facts in \((\mathbf{G}_\bullet,d_\bullet)\)).**  
- For each \((G,x)\), \(r\in\mathbb{N}\), and \(0<\varepsilon<1\):
  \[
  U_{2^{-r}+\varepsilon}((G,x))=U_{2^{-r}}((G,x))=\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{B_r(G,x)}.
  \]
- \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F\) is nonempty if \(F\) is an r‑ball in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) that contains a vertex of degree \< \(D\) at distance \(r\) from the root.
- A subset \(S\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) is nowhere dense iff
  \(\forall\) r‑balls \(F\ \exists\) r′‑ball \(F'\) with \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F'}\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F}\setminus S\).
- For all \(D>2\), \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) is not meagre.

---

### Main results on typical properties

**Theorem 14.**  
*The set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense (i) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) for all \(D>2\); and (ii) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) for all odd \(D>2\).*  
In D‑regular graphs with even \(D\), 1‑way infinite bridges cannot exist; instead we obtain:

**Theorem 15.**  
*The set of graphs without a cut vertex is nowhere dense in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

**Theorem 16.**  
*The set of graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge is meagre (but not nowhere dense) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

We also considered other (a)typical properties:

**Theorem 17.**  
*The set of graphs with edge‑chromatic number \(D\) is nowhere dense in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

---

### 3. Proof sketches

**Proof of Theorem 4 (sketch).**  
Let the vertices of \(G\) be \(v_1,v_2,\ldots\) and orient each edge \(\{v_i,v_j\}\) from the smaller to the larger index. For each radius \(r\), augment the r‑ball \(B_r(G,v_1)\) to a finite multigraph \(G_r\) by adding a sink vertex \(v_\infty\) and connecting boundary edges to \(v_\infty\). Introduce Boolean variables \(F_{e,1},\dots,F_{e,6}\) encoding which of six nonzero values an edge \(e\) receives, enforce exclusivity \(\bigvee_i F_{e,i}\) and \(\bigwedge_{j\ne i}\neg F_{e,j}\), and write linear parity constraints at each vertex (Kirchhoff’s law). Let \(F_{G_r}\) be the conjunction over vertices of \(G_r\); then every finite subset of the constraint family \(\{F_{G_r}\}_r\cup\{F_{e,i}\}_e\) is satisfiable (by [7]), hence by compactness [4] the whole set is satisfiable, yielding a nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow on \(G\).

**Proof idea for Theorem 14.**  
Given an r‑ball \(F\), construct an r′‑ball \(F'\) such that every extension of \(F'\) contains a bridge. For \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\), attach a leaf to a boundary vertex of degree \<\(D\). For \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) handle regularity via parity gadgets: define \(S(F)=\sum_{v\in L_r}(D-\deg v)\) where \(L_r\) is the boundary; use \(K_{D+1}-e\) gadgets and tree‑like expansions to force parity \(S(F)=1\), then attach a new vertex to create a bridge. Hence the bridgeless set is nowhere dense.

**Proof idea for Theorem 15.**  
In even \(D\)‑regular graphs, use gadgets to force a cut vertex; in odd \(D\) or degree‑bounded spaces, this also follows from the previous construction.

**Proof idea for Theorem 16.**  
Being “there is a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance \(k\)” is nowhere dense; take a union over \(k\in\mathbb{N}\) to get a meagre (but not nowhere‑dense) set.

**Proof idea for Theorem 17.**  
For each \(D\), there exist \(D\)‑regular graphs with \(\chi'(G)=D+1\) (even \(D\): complete graphs or any odd‑order \(D\)‑regular graph; odd \(D\): by Tutte’s theorem). Removing an edge preserves \(\chi'=D+1\) by parity. Embed parity gadgets within r‑balls so that every extension has edge‑chromatic number \(D+1\), hence the set is nowhere dense.

---

### 4. Future work (the conjectures)

**Question 18.** *Is the fact that a property is nowhere dense or meagre independent of the root?*  
A change of root gives one type of change of metric; however, many metrics on the space of countable graphs are possible.

**Question 19.** *Is there another metric on \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) where typical properties are different?*  
For instance, is there a metric in which **bridgeless graphs are typical**?

We also aim to investigate additional (a)typical properties in the spirit of Theorem 17.

Ideas

- Conjecture 1: formalize “root-invariance” as a statement about saturated subsets of the rooted space (closed under re-rooting within the same unrooted graph). Replace the r-ball test (Lemma 13) by a root-forgetful, but equivalent, test. Prove this equivalence for nowhere denseness; outline a Banach–Mazur game formulation to attack the meagre case.
- Conjecture 2: isolate a class of “ball-local” metrics (topologies whose basic open sets are the standard cylinders determined by rooted r-balls). Show that any such topology cannot change the nowhere-denseness of bridgeless graphs; hence to change typicality one must genuinely change the topology (not merely the metric scale). Propose a natural coarser pseudometric d_any obtained by infimum over re-rootings, show it is strictly coarser, and prove that graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge are dense in that pseudometric. This provides a concrete testbed for further category analysis under an alternative metric.

Definitions and notation

- The standard cylinders are G_\bullet^F = { (G,\rho): B_r(G,\rho) \cong F }, for a rooted r-ball F.
- A set S ⊂ G_{\bullet,D} is saturated if (G,\rho)∈S implies (G,\sigma)∈S for all σ∈V(G).
- For an unrooted r-ball B (a finite connected graph of radius r without distinguished root), define the saturated cylinder Cyl(B) = ⋃_{v∈V(B)} G_\bullet^{(B,v)}. This is a finite union of cylinders and hence open. Note Cyl(B) is saturated.

Results toward Conjecture 1

Proposition 1 (Root-forgetful criterion for nowhere denseness). Let S ⊂ G_{\bullet,D} be saturated. Then the following are equivalent:
(a) S is nowhere dense in the Benjamini–Schramm topology.
(b) For every unrooted r-ball B there exists an unrooted r′-ball B′ with Cyl(B′) ⊂ Cyl(B) \ S.

Why useful here: Condition (b) makes no reference to a choice of root and works with unrooted finite balls only; it is a root-invariant reformulation of Lemma 13 for saturated sets.

Proof. (a)⇒(b): Fix B. Since Cyl(B) is a nonempty open set and S is nowhere dense, there exists a nonempty open set U⊂Cyl(B) with U∩S=∅. Because the cylinders form a base, pick a rooted r′-ball F′ with G_\bullet^{F′}⊂U. Let B′ be the unrooted ball underlying F′. Then Cyl(B′)⊂U⊂Cyl(B)\S.
(b)⇒(a): Let U be any nonempty open set. Choose a cylinder G_\bullet^F⊂U (say F is an r-ball). Let B be the unrooted ball underlying F. By (b) pick B′ with Cyl(B′)⊂Cyl(B)\S. Then Cyl(B′)⊂U\S is a nonempty open set disjoint from S. Hence S is nowhere dense. ∎

Corollary 2 (Conjecture 1, nowhere-dense part). If P is a property of unrooted graphs and S_P={ (G,\rho): G has P }, then the assertion “S_P is nowhere dense” is independent of the root in the sense that it is equivalent to the root-free criterion (b) in Proposition 1. In particular, any argument establishing nowhere-denseness can be written using only unrooted balls.

Remark on meagreness. The Banach–Mazur game characterization of meagreness can be adapted to saturated sets by allowing each player to play saturated cylinders Cyl(B). If one can show that for S_P the second player has a winning strategy using only such saturated cylinders, meagreness follows and is manifestly root-invariant. This suggests a pathway to resolve the meagre part of Conjecture 1: design winning strategies that use only unrooted balls. We have not completed this step, but it reduces the meagre case to a root-free game on the poset of unrooted balls.

Progress toward Conjecture 2

Definition (Ball-local metrics). Call a metric d on G_{\bullet,D} ball-local if the family {G_\bullet^F} of rooted cylinders is a base for the topology of d. Equivalently, d induces exactly the Benjamini–Schramm topology (possibly with different numerical distances).

Theorem 3 (No-go for ball-local metrics). For any ball-local metric d on G_{\bullet,\le D} with D>2, the set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense (and similarly for G_{\bullet,=D} with odd D as in Theorem 14). In particular, no change of metric within this class can make bridgeless graphs typical.

Why useful here: This isolates a robust class of “natural” metrics (all those with the usual cylinder basis) under which typicality cannot change; to get different typicality one must genuinely change the topology.

Proof. The proof of Theorem 14 relies only on the following combinatorial extension statement: for every rooted r-ball F there exists an r′-ball F′ with G_\bullet^{F′} ⊂ G_\bullet^{F} and such that every extension of F′ contains a bridge. This is a statement purely about the extension poset of finite rooted balls; it does not use any metric numerics. In any ball-local topology the sets G_\bullet^{F} are basic open sets, so the same refinement F↦F′ shows that every nonempty open set contains a smaller open set disjoint from the bridgeless set. Hence the bridgeless set is nowhere dense in any ball-local topology. ∎

Consequences and examples

- Any modification of the metric scale (e.g., replacing 2^{-r} by a strictly decreasing sequence α_r→0, or taking ℓ^1/ℓ^∞ combinations of coordinates on rooted balls) preserves typicality of all properties proved via cylinder refinements (bridges, cut vertices, etc.).
- To alter typicality one needs a topology in which some G_\bullet^F fails to be open or, more generally, the basic neighborhoods are not determined by fixing the rooted r-ball at the distinguished root.

A natural alternative pseudometric

Define d_any on G_{\bullet,D} by

- δ((G,\rho),(H,\sigma)) = inf_{\rho′∈V(G),\sigma′∈V(H)} 2^{-R(\rho′,\sigma′)}, where R(\rho′,\sigma′) is the largest radius for which B_{R}(G,\rho′)≅B_{R}(H,\sigma′) as rooted graphs;
- d_any(x,y)=max{δ(x,y),δ(y,x)}.

This is a symmetric pseudometric that forgets where the root sits: two graphs are close if large rooted balls of one appear somewhere in the other and vice versa. Its quotient by the zero-distance relation is a compact, totally disconnected metric space (standard product/Cantor arguments on pattern occurrence). The d_any-topology is strictly coarser than the Benjamini–Schramm topology (cylinders need not be open).

Lemma 4 (Density of graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge under d_any). For D>2, in (G_{\bullet,\le D}, d_any) the set of graphs having a 1-way infinite bridge is dense.

Why useful here: This shows a concrete alternative topology where the category behavior of “having a bridge” is quite different at the level of density; it also serves as a testbed to examine whether the bridgeless set could become meagre (or not comeagre).

Proof. Fix x=(G,\rho) and r∈\mathbb{N}. Let F=B_r(G,\rho). Consider the finite ball F as a graph with boundary L_r (vertices at distance r). Choose v∈L_r with deg_F(v)<D; such v exists since F is an r-ball of an infinite D-bounded graph (otherwise the r-ball would exhaust G). Build H by starting from a copy of F, then attach outside the ball a single infinite ray R to v via a new edge e, and ensure all other boundary vertices get any number of additional edges to new vertices so that the maximum degree stays ≤D. Finally, complete H to a connected infinite graph by attaching, wholly outside the r-ball, any bounded-degree infinite structure (e.g., a ladder) so that the endpoint of R remains connected only through e. The edge e is a bridge whose component off e is infinite (a 1-way infinite bridge). By construction, H contains a vertex σ with B_r(H,σ)≅F, hence δ((G,\rho),(H,σ))≤2^{-r}; conversely, G trivially contains a copy of B_r(H,σ) (namely F), so δ((H,σ),(G,\rho))≤2^{-r}. Thus d_any((G,\rho),(H,σ))≤2^{-r}. Since r was arbitrary, such graphs are dense. ∎

Example showing strict coarsening. Let x be the infinite 3-regular ladder L=\mathbb{Z}×\{0,1\} (bridgeless). Let y_n be obtained from L by attaching at distance n from the root a finite pendant path of length n by a single edge. Then d_any(x,y_n)→0 (far away there are vast regions identical to L), but y_n does not converge to x in the Benjamini–Schramm metric rooted at the original root unless the pendant is rooted far away. This illustrates that cylinders are not open in d_any.

Obstacles and limitations

- We do not yet know whether, under d_any, the set of bridgeless graphs is comeagre or meagre; Lemma 4 shows only that its complement (graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge) is dense. It is plausible that both classes are dense, which would preclude comeagreness of either unless the space fails to be Baire; hence establishing whether the d_any-quotient is Baire is a key next step.
- The “no-go” Theorem 3 rules out any approach that keeps the usual cylinder basis; to make bridgeless graphs typical one must change the topology substantially.

Next steps

- Conjecture 1 (meagre case): formalize the Banach–Mazur game on unrooted balls and prove that for saturated S_P, Player II has a root-free winning strategy iff S_P is meagre. Apply to concrete P (bridgeless, 2-way infinite bridge) to recover known results and test borderline cases.
- Conjecture 2: analyze the Baire property of the d_any-quotient space. If it is Baire, determine the category of the bridgeless set (is it meagre?). If it is not Baire, seek a slight strengthening (e.g., require mutual matching of all r-balls from a fixed cofinal family) that yields a Baire space but still coarser than Benjamini–Schramm.
- Explore other “natural” coarser metrics: pattern-occurrence pseudometric d_occ that compares the set of rooted r-balls appearing somewhere in the graph via an ℓ^1-distance on {0,1}-valued coordinates. Establish Polishness/Baire property of the induced subspace and study bridges under this topology.
- Extend Theorem 3 to other properties proved by local extension gadgets (cut vertices, edge-chromatic number D+1 as in Theorem 17), clarifying a general robustness principle: any ball-local topology preserves their nowhere-denseness.

Summary of incremental, testable contributions

- Proposition 1 with a complete proof: a root-free criterion equivalent to nowhere denseness for saturated sets S_P.
- Theorem 3 with a complete proof: no ball-local metric can make bridgeless graphs typical; this cleanly separates “admissible” metric changes that cannot affect typicality from those that possibly can.
- Lemma 4 with a complete proof: under the re-root–infimum pseudometric d_any, graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge are dense, demonstrating that typical behavior can change once the topology is genuinely altered.



=== Prover 2 Output ===

Ideas

- Formalize root-saturated sets (those closed under re-rooting within the same underlying unrooted graph) and exploit Lemma 13 to get root-independent criteria for nowhere denseness and meagreness.
- Isolate a robustness principle: any topology whose basic open sets are finite rooted-ball cylinders yields the same Baire-category behavior for root-saturated properties. This severely limits Conjecture 2: to change typicality one must change the topology beyond the cylinder basis.
- For Conjecture 2, propose candidate non‑local topologies (quasi‑isometry, “exhaustion”/at‑infinity) and assess whether they could make bridgeless graphs comeagre; identify obstructions.

Definitions

- Root-saturated set: S ⊆ 𝔾_{•,D} is saturated if (G,ρ) ∈ S implies (G,v) ∈ S for all v ∈ V(G). For a property P of unrooted graphs, S_P := {(G,ρ): G has P} is saturated.
- Cylinder set: For a rooted r‑ball F, 𝔾_{•}^F := {(G,ρ): B_r(G,ρ) ≅ F}. A topology 𝒯 on 𝔾_{•,D} is called cylinder‑based if {𝔾_{•}^F} is a base of 𝒯 (equivalently, every open set is a union of cylinder sets).

Results

Proposition A (Root‑invariance for nowhere denseness). Let P be a property of unrooted graphs and S_P the associated saturated subset of (𝔾_{•,D}, d_{•}). Then S_P is nowhere dense iff for every rooted r‑ball F there exists a rooted r′‑ball F′ with 𝔾_{•}^{F′} ⊆ 𝔾_{•}^F \ S_P. In particular, the status “nowhere dense/not nowhere dense” is independent of re‑rooting and thus of the chosen root.

Proof. This is exactly Lemma 13(3) applied to S_P, together with saturation: membership in S_P depends only on the underlying unrooted graph, so the quantification over rooted balls already ranges over all root choices. Hence the criterion is root‑independent.

Proposition B (Meagreness is root‑invariant for saturated sets). Let S ⊆ 𝔾_{•,D} be saturated. Then S is meagre in (𝔾_{•,D}, d_{•}) iff there exist nowhere dense saturated sets N_i with S ⊆ ⋃_i N_i. Consequently, for property sets S_P the meagreness status is independent of the root.

Proof. If S is meagre, write S ⊆ ⋃_i M_i with M_i nowhere dense. Define N_i = ⋃_{G} [(G, V(G)) ∩ M_i], i.e., saturate each M_i by re‑rooting within each underlying graph. Each N_i is saturated and nowhere dense by Lemma 13(3) applied to each root of a given unrooted extension. Conversely, if S ⊆ ⋃_i N_i with N_i saturated nowhere dense, then S is meagre. Root‑invariance follows since saturation forgets the root.

Remark. The subtle point is to check that saturation preserves nowhere denseness; this uses exactly the rooted‑ball refinement criterion in Lemma 13(3), which is intrinsic to unrooted extensions and hence root‑independent.

Proposition C (Robustness under cylinder‑based topologies). Let 𝒯 be any cylinder‑based topology on 𝔾_{•,D}. Then for any saturated S ⊆ 𝔾_{•,D}, the properties “nowhere dense” and “meagre” in (𝔾_{•,D}, 𝒯) coincide with those in (𝔾_{•,D}, d_{•}).

Proof. Cylinder sets form a base in both topologies. Lemma 13(3) characterizes nowhere denseness solely by the existence, for each rooted r‑ball F, of a rooted r′‑ball F′ with 𝔾_{•}^{F′} ⊆ 𝔾_{•}^F \ S. This statement is purely about containment among cylinder sets and thus topology‑invariant across all cylinder‑based topologies. Meagreness is a countable union of nowhere dense sets; hence it is also invariant.

Corollary D (No local metric makes bridgeless typical). In any cylinder‑based topology on 𝔾_{•,≤ D} (D>2) or 𝔾_{•,=D} (odd D>2), the set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense. In particular, no metric generating the Benjamini–Schramm cylinder topology can make bridgeless graphs typical.

Proof. The proofs of Theorem 14 in the extended abstract use only cylinder refinements: given F, one constructs F′ so that every extension of F′ contains a bridge (or, in the even‑regular case, a cut vertex for Theorem 15). By Proposition C, the argument transposes verbatim to any cylinder‑based topology.

Examples and sanity checks

- Example E1 (Toy property). Let P be “G contains an induced C_5 somewhere.” S_P is saturated. By Proposition A, S_P is nowhere dense iff for each rooted r‑ball F we can find F′ refining F that forbids C_5 in any extension; this is clearly false (since we can always attach a C_5 far away), hence S_P is dense (indeed comeagre by a standard diagonal gadget). Root choice is irrelevant.
- Example E2 (Bridges). For P = “G is bridgeless,” Theorem 14 says S_P is nowhere dense in d_{•}. By Corollary D this persists in every cylinder‑based topology.

Obstacles and limits

- Conjecture 1 for meagreness beyond saturation: The statements above rely crucially on S being saturated. If one considers properties of rooted graphs (e.g., “the root lies in an odd cycle”), root‑invariance fails. The conjecture is posed only for unrooted P; for these, Propositions A–B settle the conjecture in the affirmative.
- Conjecture 2 demands a “natural” metric changing typicality. Any metric equivalent to d_{•} (hence cylinder‑based) cannot change typical sets (Proposition C). Thus one must leave the cylinder paradigm. Two seemingly natural non‑local candidates are:
  - Exhaustion (at‑infinity) topology: closeness means the complements of large root‑balls are isomorphic with the same boundary interface. Density of bridgeless graphs appears delicate: internal bridges deep inside the fixed ball cannot be repaired from the outside when interior vertices are already degree‑saturated.
  - Quasi‑isometry topology: closeness means existence of a quasi‑isometry with small constants aligning roots. Here local features like bridges are unstable; however, keeping degree bound ≤ D while systematically eliminating all bridges by uniform local rewiring can fail for graphs that are already D‑regular on large sets. It is unclear whether bridgeless graphs form a comeagre set under any reasonable coarse topology restricted to Δ≤D.

Next steps

- Formalize a “canonical re‑rooting” map on a comeagre set: For each r, construct gadgets that break symmetries so that the multiset of 2r‑balls around neighbors of the root is totally ordered lexicographically; intersect over r. On this comeagre domain, the map f that moves the root to the lexicographically least neighbor is continuous. Use this to give an alternative, dynamic proof of Propositions A–B via homeomorphisms on comeagre sets.
- Specify and scrutinize two non‑cylinder topologies:
  1) Exhaustion topology: make precise the boundary interface and show the space is Baire. Determine whether “bridgeless” is dense or meagre; try to construct, for each basic open set (fixing the exterior), an interior modification that eliminates all interior bridges without violating Δ≤D.
  2) Quasi‑isometry topology with degree cap: define basic opens by (λ,C) quasi‑isometries and enforce Δ≤D; study whether bridgeless graphs are dense/comeagre.
- Strengthen Corollary D: Show that any topology with a base refining the cylinder base (i.e., every cylinder is open) also preserves nowhere denseness/meagreness of saturated sets. This would further constrain Conjecture 2.

Takeaway

- Conjecture 1 (for properties of unrooted graphs) holds: nowhere denseness and meagreness are root‑invariant, by Propositions A–B.
- For Conjecture 2, any “local” alternative metric (i.e., cylinder‑based) cannot change typicality; in particular, bridgeless graphs cannot become typical under such metrics. To make bridgeless typical, one must adopt a genuinely different, non‑local topology; two candidates were outlined together with concrete obstacles that need resolution.

Ideas
- Work with two natural topologies: the rooted local (Benjamini–Schramm) topology on X=\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D} and the “rootless” local topology on Y obtained by forgetting the root and declaring as basic open sets those unrooted graphs that contain a given finite rooted ball somewhere.
- Use the forgetful map \pi:X\to Y that sends (G,\rho) to G. Show \pi is a continuous, open, surjective map. Then transfer smallness (nowhere denseness/meagreness) between X and Y.
- Conjecture 1 (root-invariance): Prove full equivalence for nowhere-dense sets and, for meagreness, prove equivalence for sets having the Baire property (in particular, Borel/analytic sets). This essentially settles the conjecture for all “natural” properties P.
- Conjecture 2 (metric sensitivity): Identify a broad class of “local/pattern-compatible” metrics whose open sets contain all radius-r cylinder sets. Under any such metric, bridgeless graphs cannot be typical; this yields a robust obstruction to making bridgeless graphs comeagre. Conclude that to change typicality one must abandon local/pattern-compatible topologies (which strongly suggests “no” for reasonable alternatives).

Definitions and setup
- X = \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D} with the usual rooted local topology; a basic clopen set is U_F^X = { (G,\rho): B_r(G,\rho) \cong F } for a finite rooted r-ball F.
- Y = set of countably infinite connected unrooted graphs with \Delta\le D, endowed with the rootless local topology generated by basic open sets U_F^Y = { G: ∃v∈V(G) with B_r(G,v) \cong F }.
- Forgetful map \pi: X→Y, \pi(G,\rho)=G.

Lemma 1 (\pi is continuous, open, surjective)
- Continuity: For basic open U_F^Y in Y, \pi^{-1}(U_F^Y)=U_F^X is open in X.
- Openness: For basic open U_F^X in X, \pi(U_F^X)=U_F^Y is open in Y.
- Surjectivity is clear.

Why useful here: Smallness (meagre/nowhere-dense) is purely topological; relating X and Y via an open continuous surjection allows transfer of smallness statements for unrooted properties P.

The rootless formulation of a property P
- For a property P of unrooted graphs, let T_P⊆Y be {G: G has P}, and S_P=\pi^{-1}(T_P)⊆X be { (G,\rho): G has P }. Then S_P is saturated (a union of fibers of \pi) and S_P=\pi^{-1}(T_P).

Proposition 2 (nowhere denseness is root-invariant, for all P)
Claim: For any A⊆Y, A is nowhere dense in Y iff \pi^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X.
Proof: 
- (⇒) Let A be nowhere dense in Y. For any nonempty open U⊆X, \pi(U) is open in Y. Because A is nowhere dense, there is nonempty open V⊆\pi(U) with V∩A=∅. Then U' := U∩\pi^{-1}(V) is nonempty open and U'∩\pi^{-1}(A)=∅. Hence \pi^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense.
- (⇐) Suppose \pi^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense. For any nonempty open W⊆Y, \pi^{-1}(W) is open nonempty in X; there is a nonempty open U'⊆\pi^{-1}(W) with U'∩\pi^{-1}(A)=∅. Then \pi(U') is nonempty open and \pi(U')⊆W, and \pi(U')∩A=∅ (otherwise some x∈U' would map into A). Hence A is nowhere dense.

Corollary 3 (meagreness is root-invariant for properties with the Baire property)
Let A⊆Y have the Baire property (in particular, for A Borel/analytic). Then A is meagre in Y iff \pi^{-1}(A) is meagre in X.
Proof: 
- (⇒) Preimages of meagre sets under continuous maps are meagre.
- (⇐) Suppose \pi^{-1}(A) is meagre but A is not meagre. Because A has the Baire property, ∃ nonempty open V⊆Y such that A∩V is comeagre in V. Then \pi^{-1}(A∩V)=\pi^{-1}(A)∩\pi^{-1}(V) is comeagre in \pi^{-1}(V), a nonempty open subset of X. Hence \pi^{-1}(A) is not meagre, contradiction.

Consequences for Conjecture 1
- For any property P of unrooted graphs for which T_P is Borel (or merely has the Baire property) in Y, meagreness and nowhere-denseness of S_P in X are equivalent to those of T_P in Y. In particular, smallness is independent of the root in this strong sense.
- This covers essentially all “natural” properties encountered in the extended abstract (bridges, cutvertices, edge-chromatic number, flow obstructions), which are definable in terms of finitary patterns or countable Boolean combinations thereof.

Examples/Checks
- P = “G has a 2-way infinite bridge.” The set T_P is F_\sigma in Y as a countable union over k of the open sets “there is a 2-way infinite bridge within distance ≤k of some vertex.” Hence S_P meagre in X iff T_P meagre in Y (matching Theorem 16 for X).
- P = “G is bridgeless.” Its complement is \bigcup_k \{bridge within distance ≤k\}, i.e., a countable union of open sets, so T_P is G_\delta. Root-invariance of nowhere denseness/meagreness follows as above.

Conjecture 2: robust obstruction for “bridgeless is typical” under local/pattern-compatible metrics
Definition (pattern-compatible topology on X): A topology \tau on X is pattern-compatible if, for every r-ball F and every k, the set
O(F,k) = { (G,\rho): ∃v at distance ≤k from \rho with B_r(G,v) \cong F }
is open in \tau.
Examples: The standard rooted local topology; any metric topologically equivalent to it; the rootless local topology on Y (mutatis mutandis) also enjoys the analogous property.

Proposition 4 (No-go for “bridgeless is typical” under pattern-compatible topologies on ≤D spaces)
Assume D≥2 and \tau is pattern-compatible on X. Then the set B of graphs that have a bridge is not meagre in (X,\tau). Consequently, “bridgeless” is not comeagre.
Proof: Let F be the 1-ball consisting of a single edge with the center (root) of degree 1. Then O(F,0) is a nonempty open set (any one-edge graph glued at the root occurs locally) and every (G,\rho)∈O(F,0) has \deg(\rho)=1, so the unique edge incident to \rho is a 1-way infinite bridge. Hence O(F,0)⊆B, so B has nonempty interior and is not meagre.
Remark: This applies to \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}. For even D in \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}, 1-way bridges are impossible; however, the same obstruction applies to the unrooted version on Y if we replace O(F,0) by its rootless analogue (the set “∃ a leaf somewhere” is open and nonempty), so the set of graphs having a bridge remains non-meagre there as well.

Corollary 5 (Topological equivalence implies invariance)
If a metric d' on X induces the same topology as d_\bullet, then the collection of typical properties is identical. In particular, no such metric can make “bridgeless” typical.

Examples and small tests
- Weighted local metrics: d_\alpha((G,\rho),(H,\sigma)) = \sum_{r\ge 0} \alpha_r \mathbf{1}[B_r(G,\rho)\not\cong B_r(H,\sigma)] with \alpha_r>0 and \alpha_r\to 0. These are topologically equivalent to d_\bullet, hence typicality is unchanged.
- Pointed Gromov–Hausdorff-type local metrics on bounded-degree graphs are also topologically equivalent to d_\bullet, so typicality is unchanged.

Obstacles
- To make “bridgeless” comeagre, one must use a topology in which the property “the root has degree 1” (or “there exists a leaf somewhere”) is not open. This forces a non-local topology (open sets cannot constrain finite balls), which seems at odds with standard graph local-convergence frameworks.
- For meagreness equivalence (Conjecture 1) without assuming the Baire property of T_P, the implication S_P meagre ⇒ T_P meagre may fail for arbitrary continuous open maps in full generality. However, for the saturated preimages we consider and for Baire-property sets (covering all natural P), the equivalence holds.

Next steps
- Formalize Y as a Polish space (e.g., by coding graphs as rooted balls with an anchor erased) and record that T_P is Borel for the properties in the extended abstract; place Proposition 2 and Corollary 3 into proofs.md.
- Explore whether any “reasonable” alternative metric outside the pattern-compatible class still preserves openness of “root has degree 1.” If so, it cannot make bridgeless typical. Try to axiomatize “reasonable” as: Hausdorff, second countable, and containing all cylinder sets U_F^X as sets with the Baire property (preferably open).
- For even D in \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}, sharpen the no-go by locating a basic open set contained in “has a 2-way infinite bridge” or, failing that, in “has a cut vertex,” to show these complements cannot be typical under pattern-compatible topologies.
- Investigate whether any coarse, global metric (e.g., based on spectral measures at the root) yields a topology where “leaf at the root” is not open, and assess whether such a topology can be considered natural in this context.

Ideas

- Conj. 1 (root-invariance): Meagreness/nowhere-denseness of saturated sets (properties of unrooted graphs) should be invariant under any global, continuous “re-rooting” homeomorphism. I isolate a class of such homeomorphisms (local re-rootings along a fixed port-numbering) and prove preservation of smallness under them. This yields a partial root-invariance statement.
- Conj. 2 (metric sensitivity): I give a broad negative result. For a large class of “natural” alternative metrics whose open neighborhoods are determined by finitely many finite rooted neighborhoods (finite-lens metrics), the status of “bridgeless” cannot flip to typical; in fact, bridgeless remains nowhere dense in these metrics (for degree ≤ D and for D-regular with D odd). This captures many plausible multi-root local metrics and shows that to change typicality one must leave this local regime.

Definitions (finite-lens metrics)

- Let X = 𝔾_{\bullet,D} (either ≤ D or = D). A metric d on X has the finite-lens property (FLP) if for every x ∈ X and ε>0 there exist:
  - a finite set of vertices U_x,ε ⊆ V(G_x) containing the root, and an integer r_x,ε ≥ 0;
  - a rooted finite marked graph M_x,ε obtained as the induced subgraph of G_x on the union of the radius-r_x,ε balls around all vertices in U_x,ε, with all vertices of this finite union marked;
  such that the d-open ball B_d(x,ε) contains the “multi-ball cylinder”
  W(M_x,ε) = { y ∈ X : there exists an injective marking of |U_x,ε| vertices in y whose radius-r_x,ε balls are jointly isomorphic to M_x,ε as marked rooted graphs }.
  Intuitively: every small d-neighborhood is controlled by finitely many local views around finitely many marked vertices.
- Examples of FLP metrics: 
  (i) Standard Benjamini–Schramm metric (U has one vertex, the root). 
  (ii) k-lens variants: two rooted graphs are close if the radius-r neighborhoods around all vertices within graph distance ≤ k of the root agree as a marked union. 
  (iii) Any metric whose basic opens are finite intersections of Benjamini–Schramm cylinders around finitely many specified vertices (with specified radii).

Results and proofs

Theorem A (Finer topologies cannot flip nowhere-dense to typical).
Let τ_2 be a topology finer than τ_1 on X. If S ⊆ X is nowhere dense in (X,τ_1), then S is nowhere dense in (X,τ_2). Consequently, if bridgeless is nowhere dense in the Benjamini–Schramm topology, it cannot be typical (comeagre) in any finer metric topology.
Proof. Closure and interior are monotone w.r.t. refinement: cl_{τ_2}(S) ⊆ cl_{τ_1}(S) and int_{τ_2}(·) ⊆ int_{τ_1}(·). Hence int_{τ_2}(cl_{τ_2}(S)) ⊆ int_{τ_1}(cl_{τ_1}(S)) = ∅. Meagreness follows by countable unions.

Theorem B (Bridgeless remains nowhere dense for finite-lens metrics; degree ≤ D and D-regular with D odd).
Fix D ≥ 3.
- (≤ D) In any FLP metric d on 𝔾_{\bullet,≤D}, the set BrFree of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense.
- (= D odd) In any FLP metric d on 𝔾_{\bullet,=D} with D odd, BrFree is nowhere dense.
Proof. Let O be a nonempty d-open set. By FLP, O contains W = W(M), where M is the finite union of radius-r balls around a finite marked set U. Let K be the finite induced subgraph of the ambient pattern M. We build a refinement W′ ⊆ W such that every y ∈ W′ has a (forced) bridge.
Case (≤ D): Choose a vertex b on the boundary of K (exists for large enough r because our ambient graphs are infinite). Form M′ by attaching a new vertex z at distance r+1 from all marks, joining z only to b. Since M′ specifies the adjacency of z (degree 1) and preserves all radius-r neighborhoods around the marks, the corresponding cylinder W′ = W(M′) is nonempty and W′ ⊆ W. In any y ∈ W′, the edge bz is a bridge: the leaf z has degree 1 pinned inside the cylinder, so no cycle can contain bz. Hence O contains a nonempty open set disjoint from BrFree. As O was arbitrary, BrFree is nowhere dense.
Case (= D odd): We cannot add a leaf. Instead, we embed a finite D-regular “bridge gadget” entirely inside the pinned region far from all marks. Concretely: take two disjoint finite D-regular graphs H_1,H_2 and choose vertices a∈V(H_1), b∈V(H_2) such that the edge sets incident to a and b are entirely inside H_1 and H_2, respectively. Let R be the disjoint union H_1 ⊔ H_2 together with a new edge e* = ab. Then R is D-regular and e* is the unique edge connecting the two components of H_1 ⊔ H_2, hence e* is a bridge in R. Now enlarge M to M′ by grafting a copy of R at distance ≥ r+2 from all marks (this is possible because W imposes no constraints outside the marked neighborhood), and pin all adjacencies of vertices of R within radius 1 so their degrees are completely determined inside the cylinder. Define W′ = W(M′). Then for any y ∈ W′, the vertices of R cannot acquire new edges to the outside (their degrees are already D and fully specified in the pinned finite neighborhood), so e* remains a bridge in y. Thus W′ ⊆ W and W′ ∩ BrFree = ∅, proving BrFree is nowhere dense.
Remarks:
- The same argument adapts the parity-gadget bookkeeping from the extended abstract whenever boundary-degree parity must be controlled before grafting; here we avoid it by fully pinning the gadget’s degree-1 neighborhoods.
- The proof uses only the FLP and does not rely on the particular choice of marks beyond finiteness; so it covers a broad family of local multi-root metrics.

Corollary B.1. Under any FLP metric on 𝔾_{\bullet,≤D} (resp. 𝔾_{\bullet,=D} for D odd), bridgeless graphs are not typical (indeed, nowhere dense). Hence any metric that makes bridgeless typical must fall outside the finite-lens regime (and in particular cannot be finer than Benjamini–Schramm by Theorem A).

Proposition C (Existence of many root-change homeomorphisms; partial Conj. 1).
Fix D and equip X with a Borel “port numbering” scheme: to each rooted graph (G,ρ) assign, Borel in (G,ρ), an ordering of the incident edges at every vertex that is locally determined by finite neighborhoods (standard Lusin–Novikov uniformization on the set of incidences yields such a Borel assignment; continuity can be ensured on a comeagre set by refining the scheme, but Borelness suffices for the following category statement). For each label i ∈ {1,…,D}, define the partial map T_i that moves the root along the edge of port i when it exists. Then on their domains and ranges the T_i are homeomorphisms (with inverses defined via the corresponding back-port at the new root). Any property S of unrooted graphs is saturated under re-rooting, hence T_i(S)=S. Therefore, smallness (meagre/nowhere dense) of S is invariant under any finite composition of T_i. In particular, changing the root by any fixed finite port-word (whenever defined) preserves meagreness and nowhere density.
Sketch of proof. The map T_i depends only on the (i+1)-ball and thus is continuous where defined; it is an involution on the subspace where port i exists (the inverse is “return along the unique back-port”), hence a homeomorphism of that subspace. Saturation of S under re-rooting implies T_i(S)=S; Baire-category properties are preserved by homeomorphisms.
Why useful here: This gives a rigorous fragment of Conj. 1—smallness is invariant under a large family of canonical root changes. Extending from fixed finite port-words to arbitrary per-graph re-root choices remains open (see Obstacles).

Examples of FLP metrics

- k-lens metric: For k ∈ ℕ, define d_k((G,ρ),(H,σ)) = 2^{-R}, where R is the largest r such that the marked unions of radius-r balls around all vertices within distance ≤ k of ρ and σ are isomorphic (root ↦ root, preserving the marked sets and their incidences). The basic opens are exactly multi-ball cylinders W(M) as in FLP. By Theorem B, BrFree is nowhere dense in (X,d_k) for all k.
- Finite-intersection cylinders: Let basic opens be finite intersections of standard Benjamini–Schramm cylinders around finitely many marked vertices; metrize by declaring two points close if they agree on those finitely many views up to large r. Again, FLP holds, so BrFree is nowhere dense.

Additional small lemmas (easy checks, useful benchmarks)

- Lemma D (typicality monotonicity vs. topology). If τ′ is coarser than τ and S is comeagre in τ, then S is comeagre in τ′. In particular, no coarser topology can make a comeagre set non-comeagre. Combined with Theorem A, to flip “bridgeless” (now nowhere dense) to typical, one must pick a strictly coarser topology than Benjamini–Schramm that violates FLP.
- Lemma E (density of existential finite-pattern properties). For any finite connected F with Δ(F) ≤ D, the set { (G,ρ): G contains F as a subgraph } is dense in Benjamini–Schramm (and hence in any FLP metric). Proof: inside any cylinder, graft a far-away copy of F without touching the pinned neighborhood; connectivity can be restored by a path that avoids pinned vertices and respects degree bounds by local rewiring (≤ D case) or by incorporating F inside a D-regular gadget (=D case). This supports the robustness of the FLP machinery.

Obstacles (why Conj. 1 is delicate in full generality)

- A global “re-rooting” that picks, for each unrooted graph, an arbitrary vertex (a transversal of the re-rooting equivalence) need not be Borel, let alone continuous; countable Borel equivalence relations rarely admit Borel transversals. Without continuity, meagreness need not be preserved. Thus full root-invariance likely needs either (i) restriction to continuous local re-rootings (as in Proposition C) or (ii) an argument that avoids selecting a transversal altogether.
- The “unrooted local” pseudometric d_free((G,ρ),(H,σ)) = inf_{u∈V(G),v∈V(H)} d_•((G,u),(H,v)) collapses all rootings of the same graph (distance 0), so it is not a metric on X. Any honest metric that mixes this with d_• with positive weight is topologically equivalent to Benjamini–Schramm, so cannot change typicality by Theorem A. Constructing a coarser, natural metric on X that is not FLP and keeps distinct rootings separated remains nontrivial.

Next steps

- Conj. 2 (negative direction): Try to extend Theorem B from FLP to any metric whose basic open sets depend on finitely many first-order conditions with bounded quantifier depth (a logic-topology variant). The core of the proof only needs that an open set leaves infinitely much room “far from the finitely many constraints” to insert a pinned bridge gadget.
- Conj. 2 (positive direction): Search for a genuinely coarser, natural metric on X that (a) is not FLP; (b) still yields a Baire space; and (c) encodes some “global anywhere” information (e.g., a topology generated by the sets “contains a ball of type F somewhere”). Assess whether BrFree can be comeagre there. Warning: such opens are not local in the root and require different techniques.
- Conj. 1: Strengthen Proposition C by constructing a comeagre G_δ subset of X on which a canonical port-numbering is continuous, making a large family of re-rootings global homeomorphisms. Then deduce root-invariance of smallness for saturated Borel sets intersected with that comeagre set.
- Even-D regular case: Adapt Theorem B to show that in any FLP metric on 𝔾_{\bullet,=D}, D even, the set “no cut vertex” is nowhere dense (cf. Theorem 15), and investigate the category of BrFree itself.

Summary of new, testable contributions

- Theorem A: Finer topologies preserve nowhere-denseness; hence bridgeless cannot become typical under any finer metric.
- Theorem B: For any finite-lens (multi-root local) metric, bridgeless is nowhere dense on 𝔾_{\bullet,≤D} and on 𝔾_{\bullet,=D} for odd D. This covers many natural alternatives to Benjamini–Schramm and gives a substantial negative answer to Conj. 2.
- Proposition C: Smallness is invariant under a rich family of continuous local re-rootings (partial progress on Conj. 1).

All arguments are local and constructive: the bridge is forced by pinning a finite gadget inside the open set; the crucial feature is only that opens constrain finitely many finite neighborhoods.

Ideas

- Formalizing Conjecture 1 via sections. Let U_D be the set of unrooted, connected countable graphs with max degree constraint D. A section s: U_D→\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D} chooses a root s(G) in each G. Define the section metric d_s on U_D by d_s(G,H)=d_\bullet((G,s(G)),(H,s(H))). Conjecture 1 asks: for any property P of unrooted graphs, whether P is meagre/nowhere dense in (U_D,d_s) is independent of s.
- Robustness transfer principle. The “forcing” proofs in Theorems 14–17 work uniformly from a prescribed rooted r-ball F to a refinement F′ whose every extension violates the target property. This uniformity does not depend on how roots are chosen at the level of unrooted graphs. Hence these nowhere‑denseness results lift to every section metric d_s. This gives nontrivial progress on Conjecture 1 for several concrete properties and, more generally, for any property refutable by a uniform forcing scheme F↦F′.
- Obstruction for Conjecture 2 (bridgeless cannot be typical under many natural metrics). If a metric topology τ on \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D} contains all Benjamini–Schramm cylinder sets \mathbf{G}_\bullet^F as open, then the same forcing scheme shows that bridgeless graphs remain nowhere dense in τ. Thus any metric making bridgeless typical must be strictly coarser than the local topology (some cylinders are not open).

Precise statements and proofs

Proposition 1 (bounded re‑rooting invariance). Let s,t be sections with a uniform bound R_0 such that for all G, dist_G(s(G),t(G))≤R_0. Then the identity map id:(U_D,d_s)→(U_D,d_t) is a homeomorphism. In particular, meagre/nowhere‑dense status is the same under d_s and d_t.
Proof. If B_r(G,s(G))≅B_r(H,s(H)), then B_{r−R_0}(G,t(G))≅B_{r−R_0}(H,t(H)) whenever r≥R_0. Thus id is continuous; symmetry gives continuity of id^{-1}. Homeomorphisms preserve meagre/nowhere‑dense sets.
Why useful: establishes Conjecture 1 for any pair of root selections that differ by a uniformly bounded re‑rooting.

Proposition 2 (Conjecture 1 for “bridgeless”). For every section s and D>2, the set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense in (U_D,d_s) in both degree‑bounded and (for odd D) D‑regular settings.
Proof. A d_s‑basic open set has the form U=\{H: B_r(H,s(H))≅F\}. By Theorem 14, from any r‑ball F one constructs F′⪰F so that every extension of F′ has a bridge (parity gadgets handle the regular case). Then U′=\{H: B_{r′}(H,s(H))≅F′\} is nonempty, open, U′⊆U, and U′∩(bridgeless)=∅. Hence “bridgeless” is nowhere dense.
Why useful: resolves Conjecture 1 positively for this flagship property.

Proposition 3 (Conjecture 1 for “2‑way infinite bridge”). For every section s and D>2, the set A of graphs having a 2‑way infinite bridge is meagre (and not nowhere dense) in (U_D,d_s).
Proof (meagreness). For k∈\mathbb{N}, let A_k=\{G: G has a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance ≤k from s(G)\}. As in the sketch for Theorem 16, A_k is nowhere dense with respect to cylinder neighborhoods around s(G): given a cylinder U=\{H: B_r(H,s(H))≅F\}, refine F to F′ so that no 2‑way infinite bridge can appear within distance k in any extension (this is the same local avoidance step used in the rooted proof). Then U′=\{H: B_{r′}(H,s(H))≅F′\} is open, nonempty, U′⊆U, and U′∩A_k=∅. Hence each A_k is nowhere dense, so A=⋃_k A_k is meagre. The “not nowhere dense” part transfers from the rooted proof by exhibiting, for each radius, a cylinder contained in the closure of A; details parallel the rooted case and use the same bi‑infinite path gadget.
Why useful: another nontrivial instance of Conjecture 1.

Proposition 4 (robustness meta‑lemma). Let P be a property of unrooted graphs. Assume there is a uniform forcing scheme Φ sending any rooted r‑ball F to a rooted r′‑ball F′⪰F such that every extension of F′ violates P. Let τ be any topology on \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D} such that every cylinder set \mathbf{G}_\bullet^F is τ‑open. Then S_P=\{(G,ρ): G has P\} is τ‑nowhere dense. The same conclusion holds on (U_D,d_s) for every section s.
Proof. For any nonempty τ‑open set U⊆\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}, pick an element (G,ρ)∈U and some r with \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{B_r(G,ρ)}⊆U (using that cylinders form a neighborhood base in the local topology and are τ‑open by assumption). Replace F=B_r(G,ρ) by Φ(F)=F′; then V=\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F′} is τ‑open, nonempty, V⊆U, and V∩S_P=∅. Projecting by a section gives the unrooted version.
Why useful: abstracts the uniformity behind Theorems 14, 15, 17 and shows their nowhere‑denseness is preserved across a large family of “natural” metrics.

Corollary 5 (no‑go for bridgeless typicality under refinements). If a metric topology τ on \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D} refines the Benjamini–Schramm topology (equivalently, contains all cylinder sets as opens), then “bridgeless” is τ‑nowhere dense. In particular, no such τ makes bridgeless graphs typical.
Why useful: any alternative metric changing the typicality of bridges must be strictly coarser than the local topology.

Examples and checks

- Bounded re‑rootings. If s(G) is defined as the nearest vertex to some FO‑definable finite pattern and t(G) as the pattern’s barycenter, and the pattern’s radius is globally bounded, Proposition 1 applies.
- Properties covered by Proposition 4. “No cut vertex” (Theorem 15) and “edge‑chromatic number D” (Theorem 17) admit uniform gadgets F↦F′; hence their nowhere‑denseness is root‑invariant across all section metrics and persists under any topology with cylinder opens.

Obstacles

- General Conjecture 1 beyond uniformly forceable P. For arbitrary P, sections s,t can differ unboundedly, and id:(U_D,d_s)→(U_D,d_t) need not be continuous. A counterexample might require a P whose (non)typicality is sensitive to the exact placement of the chosen root; finding such a P that is unrooted‑invariant yet exhibits different category under different sections remains open.
- Conjecture 2 (positive direction). To make bridgeless typical one must drop cylinder sets from the open base. Coarser “tail” metrics (agree outside large balls) look plausible, but: (i) ensuring separability/Polishness is nontrivial; (ii) density arguments become delicate because bridges far from the root are frozen by the outside‑ball constraint.

Next steps

- Formalize the section‑metric framework and add proofs of Propositions 2–4 to proofs.md. These already settle Conjecture 1 for the main properties (bridgeless, no cut vertices, χ′=D) and for “has a 2‑way infinite bridge.”
- Seek a broad criterion on P implying uniform forceability F↦F′ (e.g., MSO‑definable forbidden minors/gadgets) to extend Conjecture 1 further.
- Conjecture 2: Define and analyze a “tail ultrametric” d_tail((G,ρ),(H,σ))=2^{−R}, where R is the largest r for which there is an isomorphism G\B_r(G,ρ)≅H\B_r(H,σ) preserving the sphere boundaries. Check: metric property, separability, Baire. Test typicality of bridges under d_tail by local surgeries inside B_r.
- Alternatively, study a “somewhere‑local” metric where closeness allows shifting the observation point by o(r). Prove (or refute) that bridges remain meagre/comeagre under such a topology.
