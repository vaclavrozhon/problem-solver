We settled Conjecture 1 for nowhere-denseness via a clean rootless–rooted transfer: the forgetful map π from rooted to unrooted spaces is continuous and open, and A⊆Y is nowhere dense iff π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense. For meagreness, the same equivalence holds for sets with the Baire property (hence for all natural properties P). For Conjecture 2, we proved robust “no-go” results: any metric with the same cylinder base as d_• (and more generally many local FLP metrics) preserves the nowhere-denseness of bridgeless graphs. We proposed a coarser re-rooting–insensitive topology (d_any) and proved that graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge are dense there; the Baire status and typicality remain open. One construction in the D-regular case (Prover 4) needs correction; adopt parity gadgets instead. Next: formalize π-based proofs, fix the D-regular gadget, and analyze Baire/typicality for d_any.
