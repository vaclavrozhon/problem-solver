{"feedback_md":"Overall, there is solid progress on Conjecture 1 and a useful negative direction for Conjecture 2. Key points to keep/develop and issues to fix:\n\n- Root-invariance (nowhere-dense): Prover 1’s Proposition 1 is correct and essentially a root-free restatement of Lemma 13 for saturated sets S_P. Prover 3’s π: X→Y (forgetful) framework gives a fully rigorous transfer: A⊆Y is nowhere dense iff π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X; this settles the root-invariance of nowhere-denseness for all unrooted P. This is strong and clean; we should adopt this as the main line and place it in proofs.md.\n\n- Root-invariance (meagre): Prover 3’s Corollary 3 is correct: for A with the Baire property (in particular, Borel/analytic), meagreness of A in Y is equivalent to meagreness of π^{-1}(A) in X. This resolves Conjecture 1 for all “natural” graph properties P (bridges, cut vertices, edge-chromatic constraints, etc.). Prover 2’s Proposition B claims that “saturation preserves nowhere denseness” in general; this is suspect. Saturating a nowhere dense set can be dense meagre (e.g., like Q in R), so we cannot conclude it remains nowhere dense. Please retract/repair this and instead use the π-map argument.\n\n- “Ball-local/cylinder-based” metrics: Several provers (1,2,3,5) argue that any metric with the same cylinder base as d_• yields the same topology, hence identical Baire-category outcomes. Correct—this reduces to topological equivalence, so the proofs of Theorems 14–17 transfer verbatim. Prover 4’s FLP class further extends the no-go region; the ≤D case looks fine. However, the =D odd case has a flaw: constructing a finite D-regular gadget with a bridge by simply adding an edge between two D-regular graphs breaks regularity at the endpoints. A corrected gadget must pin all radius-1 neighborhoods and ensure degrees exactly D while making e* the unique interconnection; parity bookkeeping similar to the extended abstract (or a carefully designed regular “bridge gadget”) is needed. Please fix this construction.\n\n- Alternative/coarser topologies (Conjecture 2): Prover 1’s d_any (inf over re-rootings in both directions) is a natural coarser, root-insensitive candidate. The density lemma for 1-way infinite bridges under d_any is convincing and correctly argued. However, triangle inequality/topological properties of the quotient are not established; avoid claiming compact/Polish without proof. Next step: characterize the induced topology (Baire or not), then determine category of bridgeless vs. bridgeful sets.\n\nConcrete next steps:\n- Move Prover 3’s π-map lemmas (ND equivalence, meagreness for Baire-property sets) to proofs.md; these essentially settle Conjecture 1 for all natural P.\n- Repair Prover 4’s D-regular gadget or, alternatively, cite/paraphrase the parity-gadget forcing of Theorem 14(ii) to extend FLP no-go to =D odd rigorously.\n- For Conjecture 2, analyze the Baire property and basic open neighborhoods under d_any (or a similarly “rootless local” topology). Show whether both bridgeless and “has a 1-way infinite bridge” are dense; if the space is Baire, this precludes either being comeagre.\n- Add bounded re-rooting equivalence (Prover 5) to proofs.md; it’s a clean tool for section metrics.\n- Avoid claims that saturation preserves nowhere-denseness (Prover 2); rephrase using π.\n","summary_md":"We settled Conjecture 1 for nowhere-denseness via a clean rootless–rooted transfer: the forgetful map π from rooted to unrooted spaces is continuous and open, and A⊆Y is nowhere dense iff π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense. For meagreness, the same equivalence holds for sets with the Baire property (hence for all natural properties P). For Conjecture 2, we proved robust “no-go” results: any metric with the same cylinder base as d_• (and more generally many local FLP metrics) preserves the nowhere-denseness of bridgeless graphs. We proposed a coarser re-rooting–insensitive topology (d_any) and proved that graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge are dense there; the Baire status and typicality remain open.

Use the π-map, not saturation, for meagreness arguments.\n\n2) No-go regimes for Conjecture 2\n- Any metric/topology whose basic opens are exactly the rooted cylinders G_{\\bullet}^F yields the same topology as d_•; typicality (meagre/comeagre) is unchanged. This covers all “ball-local/cylinder-based” metrics and many FLP (finite-lens) variants where opens depend on finitely many finite neighborhoods.\n- FLP extension: In ≤D spaces, one can force a leaf inside any FLP-open neighborhood (pin a radius-1 neighborhood of a new vertex z with deg(z)=1), hence the bridgeless set is nowhere dense. For =D odd, a parity/degree-pinned bridge gadget is needed (parity bookkeeping as in the abstract). The naive “connect two D-regular graphs by one edge” breaks regularity—must fix this.\n\n3) Candidate coarser topology for Conjecture 2\n- Re-rooting–insensitive closeness: x and y are r-close if each contains some rooted r-ball isomorphic to a rooted r-ball of the other. Define d_any heuristically by the largest r with this bidirectional r-appearance. Under this coarser, rootless-local proximity, graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge are dense: starting from any r-ball F, attach a pendant infinite ray outside F and complete the rest away from F. This shows that density behavior changes once re-rooting is allowed.\n- Open tasks: (i) Make the induced topology precise and verify Baire property; (ii) Determine the category of ‘bridgeless’ and ‘has a 1-way infinite bridge’. If both are dense in a Baire space, neither is comeagre.\n\n4) Section metrics on unrooted space\n- For a section s selecting a root in each unrooted graph, define a local metric d_s via (G,H) ↦ d_•( (G,s(G)), (H,s(H)) ). If s,t differ by uniformly bounded root moves, the identity is a homeomorphism (bounded re-rooting equivalence).

Then:\n(i) π is continuous: For any basic open U_F^Y, π^{-1}(U_F^Y) = U_F^X is open.\n(ii) π is open: For any basic open U_F^X, π(U_F^X) = U_F^Y is open.\n(iii) π is surjective.\nProof. (i) and (ii) follow directly from definitions. (iii) is trivial since every unrooted graph admits a root.\n\nTheorem 2 (Nowhere-dense transfer between Y and X).\nFor any A ⊆ Y, A is nowhere dense in Y if and only if π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X.\nProof. (⇒) Let U⊆X be nonempty open. Then π(U) is open in Y by Lemma 1(ii). Since A is nowhere dense, there exists nonempty open V⊆π(U) with V∩A=∅. Then U′ := U ∩ π^{-1}(V) is nonempty open and U′ ∩ π^{-1}(A) = ∅. Hence π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense.\n(⇐) Let W⊆Y be nonempty open. Then π^{-1}(W) is nonempty open in X by Lemma 1(i). Since π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense, there exists nonempty open U′ ⊆ π^{-1}(W) with U′ ∩ π^{-1}(A) = ∅. Then π(U′) is nonempty open with π(U′) ⊆ W (by Lemma 1(ii)) and π(U′) ∩ A = ∅ (otherwise some x∈U′ maps into A). Hence A is nowhere dense.\n\nCorollary 3 (Meagreness transfer for sets with the Baire property).\nLet A ⊆ Y have the Baire property. Then A is meagre in Y iff π^{-1}(A) is meagre in X.\nProof. (⇒) Preimages of meagre sets under continuous maps are meagre. (⇐) Suppose π^{-1}(A) is meagre but A is not meagre. Since A has the Baire property, there exists nonempty open V⊆Y such that A∩V is comeagre in V. Then π^{-1}(A∩V) = π^{-1}(A) ∩ π^{-1}(V) is comeagre in π^{-1}(V), which is a nonempty open subset of X by Lemma 1(i). Thus π^{-1}(A) is not meagre, a contradiction.\n\nProposition 4 (Root-free criterion for nowhere-denseness in X for saturated sets).\nLet S ⊆ X be saturated (i.e., re-rooting within a fixed unrooted graph preserves membership). Then S is nowhere dense in X if and only if for every unrooted r-ball B there exists an unrooted r′-ball B′ with Cyl(B′) ⊆ Cyl(B) \\ S, where Cyl(B) := ⋃_{v∈V(B)} U_{(B,v)}^X.\nProof. Let T := π(S) ⊆ Y. Since S is saturated, S = π^{-1}(T). By Theorem 2, S is nowhere dense in X iff T is nowhere dense in Y. Applying the standard cylinder refinement characterization of nowhere denseness in Y (identical to Lemma 13(3), but with unrooted cylinders U_{(B,v)}^Y aggregated over v), we obtain the stated root-free criterion.\n\nProposition 5 (Topological invariance across cylinder-based metrics).\nLet τ be any topology on X for which the family of rooted cylinders {U_F^X} is a base. Then τ coincides with the Benjamini–Schramm topology, and for any S ⊆ X the properties “nowhere dense” and “meagre” are the same under τ and under the standard topology.\nProof. If {U_F^X} is a base, the topology it generates is the smallest topology containing all cylinders; this is precisely the standard topology. Hence τ equals the standard topology, and Baire-category notions coincide.\n\nProposition 6 (Bounded re-rooting yields homeomorphism of section metrics).\nLet U_D be the set of unrooted graphs with degree constraint D, and s,t be two sections (root choices) with sup_G dist_G(s(G), t(G)) ≤ R_0 < ∞. Equip U_D with d_s(G,H) := d_•((G,s(G)), (H,s(H))) and d_t analogously. Then id: (U_D, d_s) → (U_D, d_t) is a homeomorphism. In particular, nowhere-dense/meagre sets are preserved.\nProof. If B_r(G,s(G)) ≅ B_r(H,s(H)), then B_{r−R_0}(G,t(G)) ≅ B_{r−R_0}(H,t(H)) when r ≥ R_0. This gives continuity both ways.\n\nLemma 7 (Density of graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge under re-rooting–insensitive local closeness).\nFix D ≥ 2. For any (G,ρ)∈X and r∈ℕ, there exists (H,σ) with Δ(H)≤D such that:\n(i) B_r(H,σ) ≅ B_r(G,ρ);\n(ii) H contains a 1-way infinite bridge.\nConsequently, in any topology where basic neighborhoods of (G,ρ) include all graphs containing a rooted copy of B_r(G,ρ) somewhere (and symmetrically in the other direction), the set of graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge is dense.\nProof. Let F := B_r(G,ρ). Since G is infinite, there exists a boundary vertex v∈V(F) (dist_F(v,ρ)=r) that has a neighbor in G\\V(F). Hence deg_F(v) < deg_G(v) ≤ D. Build H by taking a copy of F and, outside F, adding a new vertex z adjacent only to v and attaching to z an infinite ray (z=w_0,w_1,w_2,…). For every other boundary vertex u of F, if desired, add new neighbors and finite trees outside F to keep Δ(H)≤D and ensure connectivity of H beyond F. Let σ be the copy of ρ in H. Then (i) holds by construction. The edge vz is a bridge in H and the component containing the ray is infinite, so (ii) holds.\n\nRemarks.\n- Proposition 4 and Theorem 2 together settle Conjecture 1 for nowhere denseness (root-invariant) and for meagreness for all Baire-property properties P of unrooted graphs (in particular, Borel P).\n- Proposition 5 formalizes the no-go for “ball-local” or “cylinder-based” alternative metrics: typicality cannot change.\n- Lemma 7 provides a concrete density phenomenon in a coarser, re-rooting–insensitive setting, motivating further analysis of Baire/totypicality there.\n"},"output_update":{"action":"append","content":"Main interim results toward the conjectures\n\n- Root-invariance (Conjecture 1):\n  • Nowhere-dense part resolved.
