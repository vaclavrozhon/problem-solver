Working log — Conjectures 1 and 2

1) Root-invariance (Conjecture 1)
- Spaces: X = G_{\bullet,D} (rooted local topology), Y = unrooted countable connected graphs with Δ≤D, endowed with the rootless local topology generated by sets U_F^Y = {G: ∃v with B_r(G,v) ≅ F}.
- Forgetful map π: X → Y, π(G,ρ)=G, is continuous, open, surjective.
- Consequences:
  • Nowhere denseness transfers: A⊆Y is nowhere dense ⇔ π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X.
  • Meagreness transfers for sets with the Baire property (e.g., Borel/analytic): A meagre in Y ⇔ π^{-1}(A) meagre in X.
  • Hence for any natural property P of unrooted graphs (bridges, cut vertices, edge-chromatic constraints, etc.), the smallness/meagreness status of S_P in X is root-invariant.
- Alternative restatement (root-free ND test): For saturated S⊆X, S is nowhere dense ⇔ for every unrooted r-ball B there exists an unrooted r′-ball B′ with Cyl(B′) ⊂ Cyl(B) \ S, where Cyl(B)=⋃_{v∈V(B)} G_{\bullet}^{(B,v)}.
- Caution: Saturating a nowhere dense set need not remain nowhere dense (can become dense meagre). Use the π-map, not saturation, for meagreness arguments.

2) No-go regimes for Conjecture 2
- Any metric/topology whose basic opens are exactly the rooted cylinders G_{\bullet}^F yields the same topology as d_•; typicality (meagre/comeagre) is unchanged. This covers all “ball-local/cylinder-based” metrics and many FLP (finite-lens) variants where opens depend on finitely many finite neighborhoods.
- FLP extension: In ≤D spaces, one can force a leaf inside any FLP-open neighborhood (pin a radius-1 neighborhood of a new vertex z with deg(z)=1), hence the bridgeless set is nowhere dense. For =D odd, a parity/degree-pinned bridge gadget is needed (parity bookkeeping as in the abstract). The naive “connect two D-regular graphs by one edge” breaks regularity—must fix this.

3) Candidate coarser topology for Conjecture 2
- Re-rooting–insensitive closeness: x and y are r-close if each contains some rooted r-ball isomorphic to a rooted r-ball of the other. Define d_any heuristically by the largest r with this bidirectional r-appearance. Under this coarser, rootless-local proximity, graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge are dense: starting from any r-ball F, attach a pendant infinite ray outside F and complete the rest away from F. This shows that density behavior changes once re-rooting is allowed.
- Open tasks: (i) Make the induced topology precise and verify Baire property; (ii) Determine the category of ‘bridgeless’ and ‘has a 1-way infinite bridge’. If both are dense in a Baire space, neither is comeagre.

4) Section metrics on unrooted space
- For a section s selecting a root in each unrooted graph, define a local metric d_s via (G,H) ↦ d_•( (G,s(G)), (H,s(H)) ). If s,t differ by uniformly bounded root moves, the identity is a homeomorphism (bounded re-rooting equivalence). Local forcing arguments (as in Theorem 14) show ‘bridgeless’ remains nowhere dense for every section metric.

5) Action items
- Move π-based proofs (nowhere-dense equivalence; meagreness for Baire sets) into proofs.md.
- Repair the =D odd FLP construction by using a fully pinned D-regular bridge gadget (or reintroduce parity gadgets) and document the argument.
- Formalize the topology behind d_any (Polish/Baire?) and analyze the category of bridge-related properties therein.
- For ‘2-way infinite bridge’ across section metrics, fill in the ‘not nowhere dense’ part via explicit dense sets built by bi-infinite path gadgets.
