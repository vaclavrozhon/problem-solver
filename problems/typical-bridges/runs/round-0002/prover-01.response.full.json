Conjecture 1 (root-invariance): full resolution\\n\\nLemma A1 (\u03c0 is continuous, open, surjective). For any rooted r-ball F, \u03c0(G_\\\\bullet^F)=U_F^Y and \u03c0^{-1}(U_F^Y)=G_\\\\bullet^F.

For (1), the inclusion cl_X \u03c0^{-1}(A) \u2286 \u03c0^{-1}(cl_Y A) holds for every continuous map. For the reverse, take x \u2208 \u03c0^{-1}(cl_Y A). For any open U \u2282 X with x\u2208U, \u03c0(U) is open (\u03c0 open) and contains \u03c0(x) \u2208 cl_Y A, so \u03c0(U)\u2229A \u2260 \u2205. Thus U\u2229\u03c0^{-1}(A) \u2260 \u2205. Hence x \u2208 cl_X \u03c0^{-1}(A). For (2), use int = Y \\\\ cl(Y\\\\\u00b7) and (1), or note \u03c0 is a quotient map so inverse images preserve interiors.\\n\\nProposition A3 (nowhere-dense equivalence). For any A \u2286 Y,\\nA is nowhere dense in Y \u21d4 \u03c0^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X.\\nProof. A nowhere dense iff int_Y cl_Y A = \u2205. Apply Lemma A2 twice: int_X cl_X \u03c0^{-1}(A) = \u03c0^{-1}(int_Y cl_Y A). Since \u03c0 is surjective, \u03c0^{-1}(\u2205)=\u2205 and \u03c0^{-1}(B)=\u2205 implies B=\u2205. Hence equivalence.\\n\\nProposition A4 (meagre equivalence for sets with the Baire property). Assume X,Y are Baire (true here), and let A \u2286 Y have the Baire property.

Since A has the Baire property, there is a nonempty open V\u2282Y such that A is comeagre in V. Then V\u2229(Y\\\\A) is meagre in Y and hence (by A3) \u03c0^{-1}(V\u2229(Y\\\\A)) is meagre in X. But \u03c0^{-1}(V) is nonempty open (\u03c0 open), so \u03c0^{-1}(A) is comeagre in \u03c0^{-1}(V), contradicting that \u03c0^{-1}(A) is meagre in X (Baire). Thus A is meagre.\\n\\nCorollary A5 (Conjecture 1). For any property P of unrooted graphs and S_P={(G,\u03c1)\u2208X: G has P} = \u03c0^{-1}(T_P) with T_P\u2286Y, the smallness status is root-invariant:\\n- S_P is nowhere dense in X \u21d4 T_P is nowhere dense in Y;\\n- if T_P has the Baire property (e.g., Borel/analytic), then S_P is meagre in X \u21d4 T_P is meagre in Y.\\n\\nBanach\u2013Mazur/game remark. The above also yields a root-free criterion: for saturated S\u2282X (equivalently S=\u03c0^{-1}(A)), S is nowhere dense iff for every unrooted ball B there is a refinement B\u2032 with Cyl(B\u2032)\u2282Cyl(B)\\\\A, where Cyl(B)=\u22c3 rootings F of B G_\\\\bullet^F.

A topology \u03c4 on X is ball-local if the rooted cylinders {G_\\\\bullet^F} form a base of \u03c4. Equivalently, \u03c4 induces exactly the BS topology (possibly via a different metric scale).\\n\\nTheorem B2 (no-go). In any ball-local topology on X, the conclusions of Theorems 14\u201317 (nowhere denseness of bridgeless, etc.) remain true. In particular, bridgeless graphs are nowhere dense in every ball-local topology and cannot be typical there.\\nProof sketch. The proofs of Theorems 14\u201317 proceed by: given a nonempty cylinder G_\\\\bullet^F, construct a refinement cylinder G_\\\\bullet^{F\u2032}\u2282G_\\\\bullet^F such that every extension of F\u2032 has the desired obstruction (e.g., a bridge). This argument depends only on the extension poset of finite rooted balls, not on metric numerics. Since cylinders are basic opens in any ball-local topology, the same refinement shows the target set has empty interior of its closure, i.e., is nowhere dense.\\n\\nC. Odd D-regular case: a clean parity gadget forcing a bridge\\n\\nFor D odd \u2265 3, we give a compact \u201cone-cut\u201d counting gadget that repairs earlier parity flaws.\\n\\nNotation. For a finite connected graph F (intended as an r-ball), define S(F)=\u2211_{v\u2208V(F)}(D\u2212deg_F(v))=D|V(F)|\u22122|E(F)|. In any D-regular supergraph H, the number of edges of H leaving V(F) equals S(F).\\n- Parity identity: For odd D, S(F) \u2261 |V(F)| (mod 2).\\n\\nProposition C1 (bridge-forcing refinement for =D odd). Let D be odd \u2265 3. Let F=B_r(G,\u03c1) be any rooted r-ball that occurs in some D-regular graph. Then there exists r\u2032\u2265r+1 and a rooted extension F\u2032=B_{r\u2032}(G\u2032,\u03c1) with maximum degree \u2264D such that S(F\u2032)=1. Consequently, in every D-regular extension of F\u2032, the unique edge leaving V(F\u2032) is a 1-way infinite bridge.\\n\\nProof. Start from F=B_r(G,\u03c1). Let L=L_r be its boundary. For each v\u2208L, denote \u03b4(v)=D\u2212deg_F(v)\u22651. Let c=\u2211_{v\u2208L}\u03b4(v)=S(F).\\nAdd a new layer W of t vertices at distance r+1 from \u03c1; t will be chosen. Connect each v\u2208L to \u03b4(v) distinct vertices of W (so total c cross edges). So far, degrees in L within the augmented graph F_1 are D, and vertices of W have degrees s_w\u2208{0,1,2,...} summing to c. Next add e_W edges inside W (no multiple edges), producing F\u2032 on V(F)\u222aW. Then\\nS(F\u2032) = S(F) + D t \u2212 2(c + e_W) = D t \u2212 (c + 2 e_W).\\nChoose t\u2265c with parity t \u2261 c+1 (mod 2) and so large that e_W defined below satisfies e_W \u2265 t\u22121. Set\\n e_W := (D t \u2212 c \u2212 1)/2.\\nThen S(F\u2032)=1. Since t \u2261 c+1 (mod 2) and D odd, e_W is an integer. Also e_W \u2264 \u230a(\u2211_{w\u2208W}(D \u2212 s_w))/2\u230b = \u230a(tD \u2212 c)/2\u230b, so a simple graph on W with e_W edges exists respecting degree bounds d_w \u2264 D\u2212s_w (e.g., greedily build a spanning tree on W, then add edges arbitrarily until reaching e_W). Finally, since vertices at distance \u2264 r now have degree D within F\u2032 (boundary L was saturated to D by the W-connections), F\u2032 is an (r+1)-ball. In any D-regular extension H\u2287F\u2032, the number of edges in \u03b4_H(V(F\u2032)) equals S(F\u2032)=1, so that edge is a bridge; since V(F\u2032) is finite and H is infinite, it is a 1-way infinite bridge. \u220e\\n\\nThis gives a clean, verifiable refinement step for Theorem 14(ii) (odd D case) and extends immediately to other cylinder-refinement no-go arguments (Section B).\\n\\nD. Section metrics and bounded re-rooting equivalence\\n\\nGiven a section s: Y\u2192X choosing a root s(G)\u2208V(G), define a metric on Y by d_s(G,H):=d_\\\\bullet((G,s(G)),(H,s(H))).\\n\\nLemma D1 (bounded re-rooting yields homeomorphism). If s,t are sections with sup_G dist_G(s(G),t(G)) \u2264 R, then the identity map (Y,d_s)\u2192(Y,d_t) is a homeomorphism. In fact, B_r^{d_t}(G) \u2286 B_{r\u2212R}^{d_s}(G) and vice versa (for r>R), so typicality cannot change across such section metrics.\\nProof. If B_r(G,s(G)) \u2245 B_r(H,s(H)), then B_{r\u2212R}(G,t(G)) \u2245 B_{r\u2212R}(H,t(H)) since moving the root by \u2264R only affects balls by R. This yields mutual continuity and topological equivalence.\\n\\nE. A natural coarser, root-insensitive pseudometric and two density results\\n\\nDefine on X a symmetric pseudometric d_any by\\n d_any(x,y) = max{ 2^{-sup{r: \u2203\u03c3 B_r(x) \u2245 B_r(y,\u03c3)}}, 2^{-sup{r: \u2203\u03c1 B_r(y) \u2245 B_r(x,\u03c1)}} }.\\nHere B_r(x) denotes the rooted r-ball of x=(G,\u03c1), and the sup is over re-rootings in the other graph. Two rooted graphs are close if each one\u2019s r-ball occurs somewhere in the other and vice versa.\\n\\nLemma E1 (1-way infinite bridges are dense under d_any in \u2264D). Fix D>2. For any x=(G,\u03c1) and r, there exists H with a 1-way infinite bridge and \u03c3\u2208V(H) such that B_r(H,\u03c3) \u2245 B_r(G,\u03c1) and d_any(x,(H,\u03c3)) \u2264 2^{-r}.\\nProof. Let F=B_r(G,\u03c1). Build H by taking a copy of F, pick a boundary vertex v with deg_F(v) < D, attach a new vertex a to v by a single edge e and extend a by an infinite ray outside the r-ball. Complete the rest beyond distance r to a connected infinite graph with maximum degree \u2264 D, ensuring no additional edges touch vertices inside distance r. Then e is a bridge whose outside component is infinite, and H contains \u03c3 (the copy of \u03c1) with the same r-ball. Symmetry of the construction gives the stated bound.\\n\\nLemma E2 (bridgeless graphs are dense under d_any in \u2264D). Fix D>2. For any x=(G,\u03c1) and r, there exists a bridgeless H of maximum degree \u2264 D and \u03c3\u2208V(H) with B_r(H,\u03c3) \u2245 B_r(G,\u03c1), hence d_any(x,(H,\u03c3)) \u2264 2^{-r}.\\nProof. Let F=B_r(G,\u03c1), boundary L=L_r. Take an infinite 2-edge-connected scaffold S with degrees \u2264 D and with infinitely many vertices of degree \u2264 D\u22121 to serve as ports (examples: for D\u22654, the 2D grid with some edges subdivided to create degree-2 ports; for D=3, the standard infinite ladder, which is 2-edge-connected and has many degree-2 vertices). Form H by taking a disjoint copy of F and of S. For each v\u2208L, attach one new edge from v to a distinct port p(v)\u2208V(S), choosing the ports pairwise far apart to keep degrees \u2264 D. For each unordered pair {v,w} in a fixed pairing of L, select an edge-disjoint path P_{v,w} in S between p(v) and p(w) (possible since only finitely many ports are used) and ensure v\u2014p(v)\u2014P_{v,w}\u2014p(w)\u2014w plus an internal v\u2013w path in F forms a cycle through both crossing edges. All crossing edges from L into S lie on cycles, hence are not bridges. Inside F we do not alter edges; in S all edges lie on cycles by construction. Therefore H is bridgeless. Since edges incident to L join at distance r+1 from \u03c1, B_r(H,\u03c3) \u2245 F for \u03c3 the copy of \u03c1. Degrees remain \u2264 D because each v\u2208L gains at most one new edge (\u03b4(v)\u22651) and each chosen port has degree raised by at most 1. \u220e\\n\\nConsequences. Under d_any, both \u201chas a 1-way infinite bridge\u201d and \u201cis bridgeless\u201d are dense. Determining typicality now hinges on whether (X/\u223c,d_any) is Baire; if it is, neither class can be comeagre. Establishing the Baire property (or failing it) is the key remaining step for this candidate topology.\\n\\nF. Obstacles and checks\\n\\n- The meagre equivalence in A4 required only that A has the Baire property and used the fact (A3) that preimages preserve nowhere denseness both ways. This avoids the incorrect claim that saturating a nowhere dense set remains nowhere dense.\\n- In C1 we carefully ensured F\u2032 is an (r+1)-ball by saturating all vertices in L to degree D within F\u2032; the counting choice S(F\u2032)=1 then forces a 1-edge cut in every D-regular extension.\\n- In E2, we used only finitely many ports of S, making degree control trivial. 2-edge-connectedness of S and the explicit cycle formation guarantee absence of bridges.\\n\\nNext steps\\n\\n- Prove that (X/\u223c,d_any) is (or is not) a Baire space. One approach: characterize basic open sets via finite bidirectional appearance constraints and apply the Baire category theorem via a complete metric reformulation.\\n- Extend the no-go region (B2) to larger \u201cfinite-lens\u201d topologies where basic opens are defined by finitely many rooted balls around finitely many distinguished vertices; the parity gadget C1 still applies.\\n- Explore other natural root-insensitive metrics on Y such as the pattern-occurrence metric d_occ(G,H)=\u2211_F w_F |1_{F occurs in G}\u22121_{F occurs in H}| (w_F summable). Analyze bridges\u2019 category there.\\n- Formalize a Banach\u2013Mazur game on unrooted balls (Y) to give root-free proofs of meagreness for further properties (e.g., 2-way infinite bridges) and to test robustness beyond Borel/analytic sets.\\n\"}",
