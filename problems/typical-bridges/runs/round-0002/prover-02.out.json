Prove \u03c0 is continuous, open, surjective. Then establish two transfer principles: (i) A\u2286Y is nowhere dense iff \u03c0^{-1}(A)\u2286X is nowhere dense; (ii) for sets with the Baire property, A is meagre in Y iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) is meagre in X. This settles Conjecture 1 for all natural (Borel/analytic) unrooted properties.\n- Conjecture 2 (metric sensitivity): Strengthen the \u201cno\u2011go\u201d region by showing typicality is invariant across section metrics (bounded re\u2011rootings). For odd D, repair the gadget argument that forces a bridge inside any cylinder; this extends invariance to many \u201cfinite\u2011lens/local\u201d variants. Propose a rootless \u201coccurrence topology\u201d as a genuinely non\u2011local alternative and analyze density of bridgeful graphs there.\n\nRigorous statements and proofs\n\nSetup. Fix D\u22652. Let X:=\ud835\udd3e_{\u2022,D} be the space of countably infinite, connected, rooted graphs with \u0394\u2264D (or =D) under the local metric d_{\u2022}. Let \ud835\udd3d be the countable set of rooted r\u2011ball isomorphism types over all r.\n\nUnrooted space and forgetful map.\n- Define Y to be the set of countably infinite, connected, unrooted graphs with \u0394\u2264D (or =D), endowed with the rootless local topology generated by the subbasis U_Y(F):={G\u2208Y: \u2203v\u2208V(G) with B_r(G,v)\u2245F}, F\u2208\ud835\udd3d. Define \u03c0:X\u2192Y by \u03c0(G,\u03c1)=G.\n\nLemma 1 (\u03c0 is continuous, open, surjective).\n- Continuity: \u03c0^{-1}(U_Y(F))=\ud835\udd3e_{\u2022}^{F} is a cylinder, hence open in X.\n- Openness: For any cylinder U_X(F)=\ud835\udd3e_{\u2022}^{F}\u2286X, \u03c0(U_X(F))=U_Y(F) by definition, so \u03c0 maps basic open sets to open sets; hence \u03c0 is open.\n- Surjectivity: Any G\u2208Y has some root \u03c1, so (G,\u03c1)\u2208X and \u03c0(G,\u03c1)=G.\n\nLemma 2 (X is Baire; in fact compact metric).\nProof. For \u0394\u2264D: For each r, there are finitely many rooted r\u2011balls, so by a diagonal argument any sequence has a convergent subsequence in the local metric; the limit is locally finite, connected, and infinite (since otherwise some radius would stabilize in the sequence, contradicting infinitude). Thus X is compact. For \u0394= D\u2011regular subspaces, closedness inside \u0394\u2264D follows from local degree constraints and connectivity; hence compact. Compact metric implies Baire.\n\nProposition 3 (Nowhere\u2011denseness transfers through \u03c0). Let A\u2286Y. Then A is nowhere dense in Y iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X.\nProof. Suppose \u03c0^{-1}(A) is not nowhere dense in X. Then \u2203 nonempty open U\u2286X with U\u2286cl_X(\u03c0^{-1}(A)). Since \u03c0 is open and continuous, \u03c0(U) is nonempty open in Y and \u03c0(U)\u2286\u03c0(cl_X(\u03c0^{-1}(A)))\u2286cl_Y(\u03c0(\u03c0^{-1}(A)))\u2286cl_Y(A). Hence cl_Y(A) has nonempty interior, so A is not nowhere dense. Conversely, if A is not nowhere dense, take nonempty open V\u2286cl_Y(A). Then \u03c0^{-1}(V) is open nonempty and \u03c0^{-1}(V)\u2286cl_X(\u03c0^{-1}(A)), so \u03c0^{-1}(A) is not nowhere dense.\n\nProposition 4 (Meagreness equivalence for sets with the Baire property). Assume X,Y are Baire (true by Lemma 2 for our spaces). If A\u2286Y has the Baire property, then A is meagre in Y iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) is meagre in X.\nProof. If A is meagre, then A=\u22c3_n N_n with N_n nowhere dense; Proposition 3 yields \u03c0^{-1}(N_n) nowhere dense, so \u03c0^{-1}(A) is meagre. Conversely, assume \u03c0^{-1}(A) is meagre. Write A=U\u0394M with U open and M meagre (Baire property). Then \u03c0^{-1}(A)=\u03c0^{-1}(U)\u0394\u03c0^{-1}(M). Since \u03c0^{-1}(M) is meagre and \u03c0^{-1}(A) is meagre, \u03c0^{-1}(U) is meagre. But X is Baire, so the only open meagre set is \u2205; hence \u03c0^{-1}(U)=\u2205, and because \u03c0 is surjective, U=\u2205. Therefore A=M is meagre.\n\nCorollary 5 (Conjecture 1 holds for Borel/analytic properties). For any property P of unrooted graphs (Borel/analytic), S_P:=\u03c0^{-1}(T_P) is nowhere dense (resp. meagre) in X iff T_P is nowhere dense (resp. meagre) in Y; thus the smallness status does not depend on the root.\n\nSection metrics and bounded re\u2011rooting invariance.\n- A section is a map s:Y\u2192X with \u03c0\u2218s=Id_Y (i.e., a rule choosing a root). Define d_s(G,H):=d_{\u2022}((G,s(G)),(H,s(H))).\n\nLemma 6 (Bounded re\u2011rooting equivalence). Let s,t be two sections such that \u2203N with dist_G(s(G),t(G))\u2264N for every G. Then the identity map Id:(Y,d_s)\u2192(Y,d_t) is a homeomorphism; in particular, meagre/comeagre and nowhere\u2011dense sets coincide under d_s and d_t.\nProof. Fix r. If d_s(G,H)<2^{-(r+N)}, then B_{r+N}(G,s(G))\u2245B_{r+N}(H,s(H)). Moving roots by \u2264N, we get B_r(G,t(G))\u2245B_r(H,t(H)), so d_t(G,H)\u22642^{-r}. This shows continuity of Id and its inverse (swap s,t).\n\nOdd\u2011D bridge forcing gadget inside cylinders (repair of the =D odd case).\n- For a finite connected partial subgraph H (the current finite ball we fix), define the boundary deficit S(H):=\u2211_{v\u2208V(H)}(D\u2212deg_H(v)). S(H) equals the number of edges from H to its complement in any D\u2011regular extension; crucially:\n\nFact 7 (Parity of deficit). For odd D, S(H)\u2261|V(H)| (mod 2).\nProof. S(H)=D|V(H)|\u22122|E(H)|, so S(H)\u2261|V(H)| (mod 2).\n\nGadgets.\n- Pair\u2011reduction gadget (K_{D+1}\u2212e): Let W be K_{D+1} with one edge uv removed. deg_W(u)=deg_W(v)=D\u22121, others have degree D. Attaching u and v to two boundary vertices x,y of H (by edges xu,yv) reduces the deficits at x,y by 1 each; all vertices in W are now degree D. Net effect: S(H) decreases by 2.\n- Parity\u2011flipper vertex: Add a new vertex z and connect it to two boundary vertices x,y of H. Then deg_H increases by 1 at x,y, reducing S by 2, while the new vertex contributes D\u22122 to S. Net effect: \u0394S=D\u22124, which is odd for odd D. This flips the parity of S.\n\nLemma 8 (Forcing a unique crossing: S=1). Let D be odd and H_0 be any rooted r\u2011ball in a D\u2011regular graph. Then there exists a finite extension H\u2287H_0 (i.e., add finitely many vertices/edges outside H_0, keeping degrees \u2264D) such that S(H)=1 and H is connected.\nProof. Let S_0:=S(H_0)\u22651 (H_0 cannot be closed in an infinite D\u2011regular graph). If S_0 is even, apply the parity\u2011flipper once to obtain S odd. Then, while S>1, repeatedly apply the pair\u2011reduction gadget to any two boundary vertices with positive deficit. Each application reduces S by 2 and keeps all degrees \u2264D. This process terminates with S=1.\n\nProposition 9 (Bridge forcing in odd\u2011regular spaces). In \ud835\udd3e_{\u2022,=D} with odd D>2, given any cylinder \ud835\udd3e_{\u2022}^{F} (an r\u2011ball), there exists a refinement cylinder \ud835\udd3e_{\u2022}^{F\u2032} such that every extension of F\u2032 to a D\u2011regular graph contains a bridge. Hence the set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense in any topology whose basic opens are rooted cylinders (in particular, in d_{\u2022}).\nProof. Apply Lemma 8 to H_0:=F to obtain H with S(H)=1. Let r\u2032 be the radius of H. Let F\u2032 be the rooted r\u2032\u2011ball realized by H. For any D\u2011regular graph G\u2032 extending F\u2032, the cut \u03b4(V(H)) has size exactly 1 by S(H)=1. Therefore the unique edge in \u03b4(V(H)) is a bridge in G\u2032.\n\nConsequences and no\u2011go region for Conjecture 2\n\n- Cylinder\u2011based invariance: The proofs of Theorems 14\u201317 (and Proposition 9) use only cylinder refinements. Therefore any alternative metric on X whose open sets are unions of cylinders (i.e., which induces the Benjamini\u2013Schramm cylinder topology) yields identical Baire\u2011category outcomes. In particular, bridgeless graphs remain nowhere dense under all such metrics, and cannot be typical.\n- Section metrics (bounded re\u2011roots) also preserve typicality by Lemma 6.\n\nCandidate non\u2011local topology for Conjecture 2\n\nDefine the occurrence (rootless) topology \ud835\udcaf_occ on Y: subbasis sets are U_Y(F) for F\u2208\ud835\udd3d (i.e., \u201cF occurs somewhere\u201d). Equivalently, the map \u03a6:Y\u21922^{\ud835\udd3d}, \u03a6(G)={F\u2208\ud835\udd3d : F occurs in G}, embeds Y into Cantor space; \ud835\udcaf_occ is the subspace topology. This space is compact (hence Baire) as a closed subset of 2^{\ud835\udd3d} defined by obvious consistency constraints (if an (r+1)\u2011ball occurs, then its r\u2011truncation occurs; connectedness of G can be ensured by requiring occurrence of finite connected balls around a common anchor\u2014details to be finalized). Pull back \ud835\udcaf_occ to X via \u03c0 to get a rooted alternative metric.\n\nLemma 10 (Density of 1\u2011way infinite bridges in \ud835\udcaf_occ). Fix D\u22653. For any finite list of required occurrences F_1,\u2026,F_k, there exists a countably infinite connected graph G with \u0394\u2264D that contains each F_i somewhere and has a 1\u2011way infinite bridge (e.g., a pendant infinite ray attached to a finite core). Hence the set B_1 of graphs with a 1\u2011way infinite bridge is dense in (Y,\ud835\udcaf_occ).\nSketch. Realize the F_i disjointly inside a finite connected core while respecting degree bounds (use fresh vertices to avoid conflicts). Attach a pendant infinite ray to a vertex with spare degree; this creates a 1\u2011way infinite bridge. Complete the remainder to a connected infinite \u0394\u2264D graph.\n\nRemarks/obstacles.\n- For \ud835\udcaf_occ, forcing existence of a bridge via finite positive occurrence constraints appears impossible: existence of a bridge is not monotone under adding more edges, but \ud835\udcaf_occ opens only constrain positive occurrences. Thus we currently have density of B_1 but not meagreness of its complement, nor comeagreness of B_1. If both B_1 and its complement are dense (plausible), neither is typical in this topology.\n- Establishing that the image \u03a6(Y) is closed in 2^{\ud835\udd3d} (hence compact) needs a standard compactness/consistency check; we have not yet written full details for connectivity within \ud835\udcaf_occ.\n\nExamples and sanity checks\n\n- Parity check: For D=3 and H a tree on m vertices, S(H)=3m\u22122(m\u22121)=m+2, which is odd iff m is odd, agreeing with Fact 7.\n- Bounded re\u2011rooting: On the 3\u2011regular tree T_3, choose s(G)=an arbitrary root; take t(G)=a neighbor of s(G). Then N=1 and d_s,d_t are homeomorphic by Lemma 6.\n\nObstacles\n\n- Meagreness transfer in full generality (without the Baire property) typically fails; our result (Proposition 4) leverages Baire property and compactness of X,Y. This suffices for all natural graph properties considered so far (Borel/analytic).\n- The \ud835\udcaf_occ topology\u2019s category structure for \u201cbridgeless\u201d remains unsettled; we only have a density result for 1\u2011way bridges. Proving either class is comeagre would resolve a special case of Conjecture 2 (in the negative for \u201cbridgeless typical\u201d).\n\nNext steps\n\n- Move Lemmas 1\u20132, Propositions 3\u20134, and Lemma 6 into proofs.md as the core resolution of Conjecture 1 and the bounded re\u2011rooting invariance tool for Conjecture 2.\n- Write the full, combinatorially explicit proof of Proposition 9 (odd\u2011D bridge forcing) with a precise description of the pair\u2011reduction gadget placement and termination measure S(H)\u21921, and ensure the final H is a ball F\u2032.\n- Formalize \ud835\udcaf_occ: characterize \u03a6(Y) as a closed subshift of 2^{\ud835\udd3d}, verify Baire/compactness rigorously, and analyze whether \u201cbridgeless\u201d and its complement are both dense (if yes, neither typical), or whether one side is meagre.\n- Explore other non\u2011local topologies (e.g., quasi\u2011isometry\u2011based) on \u0394\u2264D and test density/typicality of bridges via finite forcing plus coarse constraints on ends.\n\nTakeaways\n\n- Conjecture 1 holds for all Borel/analytic properties of unrooted graphs via the forgetful map \u03c0 (nowhere\u2011denseness and meagreness equivalence).\n- Conjecture 2: Typicality is invariant across all cylinder\u2011based metrics and bounded re\u2011rooting section metrics; bridgeless graphs cannot become typical there. A natural alternative \u201coccurrence topology\u201d yields different density behavior (1\u2011way bridges dense), but typicality remains open; resolving its Baire\u2011category for bridges is a promising route."
