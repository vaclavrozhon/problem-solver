Ideas

- Conjecture 1 (root‑invariance): Formalize the unrooted space Y and the forgetful map π:X→Y (X=𝔾_{•,D}). Prove π is continuous, open, surjective. Then establish two transfer principles: (i) A⊆Y is nowhere dense iff π^{-1}(A)⊆X is nowhere dense; (ii) for sets with the Baire property, A is meagre in Y iff π^{-1}(A) is meagre in X. This settles Conjecture 1 for all natural (Borel/analytic) unrooted properties.
- Conjecture 2 (metric sensitivity): Strengthen the “no‑go” region by showing typicality is invariant across section metrics (bounded re‑rootings). For odd D, repair the gadget argument that forces a bridge inside any cylinder; this extends invariance to many “finite‑lens/local” variants. Propose a rootless “occurrence topology” as a genuinely non‑local alternative and analyze density of bridgeful graphs there.

Rigorous statements and proofs

Setup. Fix D≥2. Let X:=𝔾_{•,D} be the space of countably infinite, connected, rooted graphs with Δ≤D (or =D) under the local metric d_{•}. Let 𝔽 be the countable set of rooted r‑ball isomorphism types over all r.

Unrooted space and forgetful map.
- Define Y to be the set of countably infinite, connected, unrooted graphs with Δ≤D (or =D), endowed with the rootless local topology generated by the subbasis U_Y(F):={G∈Y: ∃v∈V(G) with B_r(G,v)≅F}, F∈𝔽. Define π:X→Y by π(G,ρ)=G.

Lemma 1 (π is continuous, open, surjective).
- Continuity: π^{-1}(U_Y(F))=𝔾_{•}^{F} is a cylinder, hence open in X.
- Openness: For any cylinder U_X(F)=𝔾_{•}^{F}⊆X, π(U_X(F))=U_Y(F) by definition, so π maps basic open sets to open sets; hence π is open.
- Surjectivity: Any G∈Y has some root ρ, so (G,ρ)∈X and π(G,ρ)=G.

Lemma 2 (X is Baire; in fact compact metric).
Proof. For Δ≤D: For each r, there are finitely many rooted r‑balls, so by a diagonal argument any sequence has a convergent subsequence in the local metric; the limit is locally finite, connected, and infinite (since otherwise some radius would stabilize in the sequence, contradicting infinitude). Thus X is compact. For Δ= D‑regular subspaces, closedness inside Δ≤D follows from local degree constraints and connectivity; hence compact. Compact metric implies Baire.

Proposition 3 (Nowhere‑denseness transfers through π). Let A⊆Y. Then A is nowhere dense in Y iff π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X.
Proof. Suppose π^{-1}(A) is not nowhere dense in X. Then ∃ nonempty open U⊆X with U⊆cl_X(π^{-1}(A)). Since π is open and continuous, π(U) is nonempty open in Y and π(U)⊆π(cl_X(π^{-1}(A)))⊆cl_Y(π(π^{-1}(A)))⊆cl_Y(A). Hence cl_Y(A) has nonempty interior, so A is not nowhere dense. Conversely, if A is not nowhere dense, take nonempty open V⊆cl_Y(A). Then π^{-1}(V) is open nonempty and π^{-1}(V)⊆cl_X(π^{-1}(A)), so π^{-1}(A) is not nowhere dense.

Proposition 4 (Meagreness equivalence for sets with the Baire property). Assume X,Y are Baire (true by Lemma 2 for our spaces). If A⊆Y has the Baire property, then A is meagre in Y iff π^{-1}(A) is meagre in X.
Proof. If A is meagre, then A=⋃_n N_n with N_n nowhere dense; Proposition 3 yields π^{-1}(N_n) nowhere dense, so π^{-1}(A) is meagre. Conversely, assume π^{-1}(A) is meagre. Write A=UΔM with U open and M meagre (Baire property). Then π^{-1}(A)=π^{-1}(U)Δπ^{-1}(M). Since π^{-1}(M) is meagre and π^{-1}(A) is meagre, π^{-1}(U) is meagre. But X is Baire, so the only open meagre set is ∅; hence π^{-1}(U)=∅, and because π is surjective, U=∅. Therefore A=M is meagre.

Corollary 5 (Conjecture 1 holds for Borel/analytic properties). For any property P of unrooted graphs (Borel/analytic), S_P:=π^{-1}(T_P) is nowhere dense (resp. meagre) in X iff T_P is nowhere dense (resp. meagre) in Y; thus the smallness status does not depend on the root.

Section metrics and bounded re‑rooting invariance.
- A section is a map s:Y→X with π∘s=Id_Y (i.e., a rule choosing a root). Define d_s(G,H):=d_{•}((G,s(G)),(H,s(H))).

Lemma 6 (Bounded re‑rooting equivalence). Let s,t be two sections such that ∃N with dist_G(s(G),t(G))≤N for every G. Then the identity map Id:(Y,d_s)→(Y,d_t) is a homeomorphism; in particular, meagre/comeagre and nowhere‑dense sets coincide under d_s and d_t.
Proof. Fix r. If d_s(G,H)<2^{-(r+N)}, then B_{r+N}(G,s(G))≅B_{r+N}(H,s(H)). Moving roots by ≤N, we get B_r(G,t(G))≅B_r(H,t(H)), so d_t(G,H)≤2^{-r}. This shows continuity of Id and its inverse (swap s,t).

Odd‑D bridge forcing gadget inside cylinders (repair of the =D odd case).
- For a finite connected partial subgraph H (the current finite ball we fix), define the boundary deficit S(H):=∑_{v∈V(H)}(D−deg_H(v)). S(H) equals the number of edges from H to its complement in any D‑regular extension; crucially:

Fact 7 (Parity of deficit). For odd D, S(H)≡|V(H)| (mod 2).
Proof. S(H)=D|V(H)|−2|E(H)|, so S(H)≡|V(H)| (mod 2).

Gadgets.
- Pair‑reduction gadget (K_{D+1}−e): Let W be K_{D+1} with one edge uv removed. deg_W(u)=deg_W(v)=D−1, others have degree D. Attaching u and v to two boundary vertices x,y of H (by edges xu,yv) reduces the deficits at x,y by 1 each; all vertices in W are now degree D. Net effect: S(H) decreases by 2.
- Parity‑flipper vertex: Add a new vertex z and connect it to two boundary vertices x,y of H. Then deg_H increases by 1 at x,y, reducing S by 2, while the new vertex contributes D−2 to S. Net effect: ΔS=D−4, which is odd for odd D. This flips the parity of S.

Lemma 8 (Forcing a unique crossing: S=1). Let D be odd and H_0 be any rooted r‑ball in a D‑regular graph. Then there exists a finite extension H⊇H_0 (i.e., add finitely many vertices/edges outside H_0, keeping degrees ≤D) such that S(H)=1 and H is connected.
Proof. Let S_0:=S(H_0)≥1 (H_0 cannot be closed in an infinite D‑regular graph). If S_0 is even, apply the parity‑flipper once to obtain S odd. Then, while S>1, repeatedly apply the pair‑reduction gadget to any two boundary vertices with positive deficit. Each application reduces S by 2 and keeps all degrees ≤D. This process terminates with S=1.

Proposition 9 (Bridge forcing in odd‑regular spaces). In 𝔾_{•,=D} with odd D>2, given any cylinder 𝔾_{•}^{F} (an r‑ball), there exists a refinement cylinder 𝔾_{•}^{F′} such that every extension of F′ to a D‑regular graph contains a bridge. Hence the set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense in any topology whose basic opens are rooted cylinders (in particular, in d_{•}).
Proof. Apply Lemma 8 to H_0:=F to obtain H with S(H)=1. Let r′ be the radius of H. Let F′ be the rooted r′‑ball realized by H. For any D‑regular graph G′ extending F′, the cut δ(V(H)) has size exactly 1 by S(H)=1. Therefore the unique edge in δ(V(H)) is a bridge in G′.

Consequences and no‑go region for Conjecture 2

- Cylinder‑based invariance: The proofs of Theorems 14–17 (and Proposition 9) use only cylinder refinements. Therefore any alternative metric on X whose open sets are unions of cylinders (i.e., which induces the Benjamini–Schramm cylinder topology) yields identical Baire‑category outcomes. In particular, bridgeless graphs remain nowhere dense under all such metrics, and cannot be typical.
- Section metrics (bounded re‑roots) also preserve typicality by Lemma 6.

Candidate non‑local topology for Conjecture 2

Define the occurrence (rootless) topology 𝒯_occ on Y: subbasis sets are U_Y(F) for F∈𝔽 (i.e., “F occurs somewhere”). Equivalently, the map Φ:Y→2^{𝔽}, Φ(G)={F∈𝔽 : F occurs in G}, embeds Y into Cantor space; 𝒯_occ is the subspace topology. This space is compact (hence Baire) as a closed subset of 2^{𝔽} defined by obvious consistency constraints (if an (r+1)‑ball occurs, then its r‑truncation occurs; connectedness of G can be ensured by requiring occurrence of finite connected balls around a common anchor—details to be finalized). Pull back 𝒯_occ to X via π to get a rooted alternative metric.

Lemma 10 (Density of 1‑way infinite bridges in 𝒯_occ). Fix D≥3. For any finite list of required occurrences F_1,…,F_k, there exists a countably infinite connected graph G with Δ≤D that contains each F_i somewhere and has a 1‑way infinite bridge (e.g., a pendant infinite ray attached to a finite core). Hence the set B_1 of graphs with a 1‑way infinite bridge is dense in (Y,𝒯_occ).
Sketch. Realize the F_i disjointly inside a finite connected core while respecting degree bounds (use fresh vertices to avoid conflicts). Attach a pendant infinite ray to a vertex with spare degree; this creates a 1‑way infinite bridge. Complete the remainder to a connected infinite Δ≤D graph.

Remarks/obstacles.
- For 𝒯_occ, forcing existence of a bridge via finite positive occurrence constraints appears impossible: existence of a bridge is not monotone under adding more edges, but 𝒯_occ opens only constrain positive occurrences. Thus we currently have density of B_1 but not meagreness of its complement, nor comeagreness of B_1. If both B_1 and its complement are dense (plausible), neither is typical in this topology.
- Establishing that the image Φ(Y) is closed in 2^{𝔽} (hence compact) needs a standard compactness/consistency check; we have not yet written full details for connectivity within 𝒯_occ.

Examples and sanity checks

- Parity check: For D=3 and H a tree on m vertices, S(H)=3m−2(m−1)=m+2, which is odd iff m is odd, agreeing with Fact 7.
- Bounded re‑rooting: On the 3‑regular tree T_3, choose s(G)=an arbitrary root; take t(G)=a neighbor of s(G). Then N=1 and d_s,d_t are homeomorphic by Lemma 6.

Obstacles

- Meagreness transfer in full generality (without the Baire property) typically fails; our result (Proposition 4) leverages Baire property and compactness of X,Y. This suffices for all natural graph properties considered so far (Borel/analytic).
- The 𝒯_occ topology’s category structure for “bridgeless” remains unsettled; we only have a density result for 1‑way bridges. Proving either class is comeagre would resolve a special case of Conjecture 2 (in the negative for “bridgeless typical”).

Next steps

- Move Lemmas 1–2, Propositions 3–4, and Lemma 6 into proofs.md as the core resolution of Conjecture 1 and the bounded re‑rooting invariance tool for Conjecture 2.
- Write the full, combinatorially explicit proof of Proposition 9 (odd‑D bridge forcing) with a precise description of the pair‑reduction gadget placement and termination measure S(H)→1, and ensure the final H is a ball F′.
- Formalize 𝒯_occ: characterize Φ(Y) as a closed subshift of 2^{𝔽}, verify Baire/compactness rigorously, and analyze whether “bridgeless” and its complement are both dense (if yes, neither typical), or whether one side is meagre.
- Explore other non‑local topologies (e.g., quasi‑isometry‑based) on Δ≤D and test density/typicality of bridges via finite forcing plus coarse constraints on ends.

Takeaways

- Conjecture 1 holds for all Borel/analytic properties of unrooted graphs via the forgetful map π (nowhere‑denseness and meagreness equivalence).
- Conjecture 2: Typicality is invariant across all cylinder‑based metrics and bounded re‑rooting section metrics; bridgeless graphs cannot become typical there. A natural alternative “occurrence topology” yields different density behavior (1‑way bridges dense), but typicality remains open; resolving its Baire‑category for bridges is a promising route.
