This fixes earlier saturation pitfalls.\n- Strengthen the \u201cno\u2011go\u201d region for Conjecture 2 by constructing explicit cylinders that force a bridge:\n  \u2022 For \u2264D: trivial leaf cylinder gives interior for \u201chas a bridge\u201d.\n  \u2022 For =D and odd D: build a D\u2011regular, radius\u2011R cylinder with exactly one edge leaving the ball in any extension (hence a 1\u2011way infinite bridge). This repairs the previously flawed gadget.\n- Add a bounded re\u2011rooting invariance lemma: section metrics differing by uniformly bounded re\u2011rooting are topologically equivalent to d_\u2022.\n- Outline a coarser \u201cexist\u2011somewhere\u201d topology \u03c4_any (initial topology via \u03c0) and show density of both \u201chas a 1\u2011way infinite bridge\u201d and \u201cis bridgeless\u201d therein; leave Baire property open.\n\nRigorous results and proofs\n1) Root\u2011invariance via \u03c0\nSpaces:\n- X = \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,D} with the rooted local (Benjamini\u2013Schramm) topology.\n- Y = unrooted, connected, countably infinite graphs with \u0394\u2264D (or =D), with the rootless local topology generated by sets U_F^Y = {G: \u2203v, B_r(G,v)\u2245F}.\n- \u03c0: X\u2192Y, \u03c0(G,\u03c1)=G.\n\nLemma A (\u03c0 is continuous, open, surjective).\nProof. For a rooted r\u2011ball F, \u03c0^{-1}(U_F^Y)=U_F^X is open in X (union of rooted cylinders at all roots realizing F). Conversely, \u03c0(U_F^X)=U_F^Y is open in Y. Surjectivity is clear. \u220e\n\nProposition B (nowhere\u2011denseness transfers exactly).\nFor any A\u2286Y: A is nowhere dense in Y iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X.\nProof. (\u21d2) Let A be nowhere dense in Y. For any nonempty open U\u2286X, \u03c0(U) is nonempty and open in Y; pick nonempty open V\u2286\u03c0(U) with V\u2229A=\u2205. Then U\u2229\u03c0^{-1}(V) is nonempty open and disjoint from \u03c0^{-1}(A). (\u21d0) If \u03c0^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense and W\u2286Y is nonempty open, then \u03c0^{-1}(W) is nonempty open; choose nonempty open U'\u2286\u03c0^{-1}(W) with U'\u2229\u03c0^{-1}(A)=\u2205. Then \u03c0(U')\u2286W is nonempty open with \u03c0(U')\u2229A=\u2205. \u220e\n\nCorollary C (meagreness transfers for Baire\u2011property sets).\nIf A\u2286Y has the Baire property, then A is meagre in Y iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) is meagre in X.\nProof. (\u21d2) Preimages of meagre sets under continuous maps are meagre. (\u21d0) Suppose \u03c0^{-1}(A) is meagre but A is not; since A has the Baire property, some nonempty open V\u2286Y has A\u2229V comeagre. Then \u03c0^{-1}(A\u2229V)=\u03c0^{-1}(A)\u2229\u03c0^{-1}(V) is comeagre in nonempty open \u03c0^{-1}(V), contradiction. \u220e\n\nWhy useful: This settles Conjecture 1 for all \u201cnatural\u201d P (Borel/analytic), including bridges, cut vertices, edge\u2011colouring, etc.; nowhere\u2011denseness holds even without Baire\u2011property assumptions.\n\n2) Bounded re\u2011rooting invariance (section metrics)\nLemma D. Let T:X\u2192X map (G,\u03c1)\u21a6(G,\u03c1') with d_G(\u03c1,\u03c1')\u2264B uniformly. Then T is a homeomorphism of (X,d_\u2022) onto its image; in particular, d_\u2022 and the pullback metric via T induce the same topology.\nProof. For each r, U_r(x)=\\{y: B_r(y,root)\u2245B_r(x)\\} maps into U_{r-B}(T(x)) and contains U_{r+B}(T(x)). Thus T and T^{-1} are continuous. \u220e\n\n3) A cut\u2011size identity\nLemma E. Let H be a finite induced subgraph of a D\u2011regular supergraph G. Then\n|\u03b4_G(V(H))| = \\sum_{v\u2208V(H)} (D - deg_H v) = D|V(H)| - 2|E(H)|.\nProof. Sum degrees in G over V(H) equals D|V(H)|, which splits into 2|E(H)| plus edges of \u03b4_G(V(H)). \u220e\n\n4) Odd\u2011D regular bridge\u2011forcing cylinder (repair of gadget)\nProposition F (bridge\u2011forcing in =D, D odd \u22653). Fix any rooted r\u2011ball F that occurs in \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,=D}. There exists R\u2265r and an R\u2011ball F' extending F such that:\n(i) every vertex at distance <R from the root in F' has degree D (in F');\n(ii) S(F'):=\\sum_{x\u2208L_R} (D - deg_{F'} x) = 1;\n(iii) U_{F'}^X \u2260 \u2205 in \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,=D} and for every (G,\u03c1) with B_R(G,\u03c1)\u2245F', the unique edge of \u03b4_G(V(B_R)) is a 1\u2011way infinite bridge.\nProof. Start with F and write S_0=\\sum_{v\u2208L_r}(D - deg_F v). We perform finitely many local extensions outside radius r using three operations that do not alter B_r:\n- Sprout S: choose a boundary vertex u with deficit \u22651 and attach a fresh vertex x adjacent to u. This increases S by D-2 and increases boundary size by 1.\n- D\u2011merge D: when there are \u2265D distinct boundary vertices, add a fresh vertex y and connect y to D distinct boundary vertices; this reduces S by D and leaves y saturated.\n- Clique patch K: insert a K_{D+1}-e gadget with its two terminals joined to two boundary vertices; this reduces S by 2 and keeps all new vertices saturated.\nBecause D is odd, every integer \u2265 D-1 is a nonnegative combination 2\u03b1 + D\u03b2. Choose a\u22650 so that S_1:=S_0 + a(D-2) \u2265 D and S_1-1 \u2265 D-1. Then represent S_1-1 = 2\u03b1 + D\u03b2. Perform a sprout S a times, then \u03b2 times D\u2011merge, then \u03b1 times K. This yields a finite extension F' with S(F')=1. At each step, vertices with distance < current radius are saturated; we take R to be the final maximal distance so all vertices at distance <R have degree D in F'. Lemma E gives |\u03b4(V(B_R))|=S(F')=1 in any D\u2011regular extension. Thus the sole crossing edge is a bridge; the component inside is finite, so it is a 1\u2011way infinite bridge. Existence of an extension follows by attaching an infinite D\u2011regular completion beyond the unique crossing edge (start at its external endpoint and grow a D\u2011regular tree\u2011of\u2011gadgets to fill degrees). \u220e\n\nCorollary G (robust no\u2011go for \u201cbridgeless typical\u201d in cylinder\u2011finer topologies).\n- In \u2264D: the 1\u2011ball with a leaf at the root defines a nonempty cylinder contained in \u201chas a bridge\u201d, so \u201chas a bridge\u201d has nonempty interior; bridgeless graphs cannot be comeagre under any topology containing all cylinders as open.\n- In =D, D odd: Proposition F gives a nonempty cylinder U_{F'}^X contained in \u201chas a (1\u2011way infinite) bridge\u201d; hence the bridgeless set is not comeagre under any topology that contains cylinders as open (in particular, under any metric topologically \u2265 the Benjamini\u2013Schramm topology).\n\nRemark: For =D, D even, 1\u2011way infinite bridges are impossible; the analogous cylinder\u2011forcing for bridges remains open. However, a cylinder forcing a cut vertex exists for all D (by concentrating all crossing edges at a single boundary vertex c), recovering Theorem 15 as \u201chas a cut vertex\u201d has interior.\n\n5) Coarser \u201cexist\u2011somewhere\u201d topology \u03c4_any\nDefinition. Let \u03c4_any on X be the initial topology w.r.t. \u03c0, i.e., the coarsest topology making all sets \u03c0^{-1}(U_F^Y)= { (G,\u03c1): \u2203v, B_r(G,v)\u2245F } open.\n\nDensity observations.\n- \u201cHas a 1\u2011way infinite bridge\u201d is dense in (X,\u03c4_any): given any basic open \u03c0^{-1}(U_F^Y), extend a graph containing F by attaching a pendant infinite ray somewhere disjoint from the F\u2011region; the result remains in \u03c0^{-1}(U_F^Y) and has a 1\u2011way infinite bridge.\n- \u201cBridgeless\u201d is also dense: given F, build an infinite 2\u2011edge\u2011connected (every edge lies on a cycle) graph containing F. A constructive completion proceeds by iteratively saturating boundary deficits while closing each newly created edge into a cycle (attach pairs of disjoint paths that meet to form cycles), ensuring no bridges arise. Thus \u03c0^{-1}(U_F^Y) meets the bridgeless set.\nOpen issue: Baire property of (X,\u03c4_any) is unknown; if it were Baire, neither \u201cbridgeless\u201d nor \u201chas a 1\u2011way infinite bridge\u201d could be comeagre.\n\nExamples and sanity checks\n- For D=3, starting with any r\u2011ball F, S_0\u22651. If S_0=2, choose a=1 sprout to get S_1=3; then take one D\u2011merge (D=3) to reduce to S=0, followed by adding one K_{4}-e (reduces by 2) is impossible from 0; instead choose a=2 to get S_1=5 and then reduce by D (3) and by 2 to reach 0; adjust to reach 1 as per the general scheme. Concrete small instances can be enumerated to verify the arithmetic S\u21921.\n- Lemma E gives parity obstructions: in =D with even D, 1\u2011edge cuts from a finite inside are impossible (D|V(H)|\u22121 odd), agreeing with the need for the cut\u2011vertex rather than bridge gadget.\n\nObstacles\n- Even D regular case: forcing a 2\u2011way infinite bridge via a cylinder remains nontrivial. A 2\u2011edge cut of size 2 is cylinder\u2011forceable, but it does not certify that each crossing edge is a bridge. We leave a targeted bridge gadget for even D as an open subproblem.\n- \u03c4_any: proving Baire (or identifying a natural complete metric that induces it) is delicate; avoid Polish claims until settled.\n\nNext steps\n- Move Proposition B and Corollary C (with Lemma A) into proofs.md as the resolution of Conjecture 1 for Borel (and more generally Baire\u2011property) properties; note exact equivalence for nowhere\u2011denseness without measurability assumptions.\n- Add Lemma E and Proposition F with full details to proofs.md; this repairs the odd\u2011D regular gadget and strengthens the no\u2011go for Conjecture 2 in cylinder\u2011compatible metrics.\n- For even D in =D: attempt a direct cylinder that forces a 2\u2011way infinite bridge (or prove impossibility), or else strengthen the cut\u2011vertex interior argument to show further robust \u201cno\u2011go\u201d for changing typicality by reasonable metrics.\n- Formalize \u03c4_any via an explicit metric on X (e.g., d_any(x,y)=2^{\u2212\\sup\\{r: \u2203v,w with B_r(x)\u2245B_r(y)\\}} as a pseudo\u2011metric) and study its Baire status; if Baire, deduce neither bridgefulness nor bridgelessness is typical there.\n- Record bounded re\u2011rooting invariance (Lemma D) in proofs.md for use across section metrics.\n"
