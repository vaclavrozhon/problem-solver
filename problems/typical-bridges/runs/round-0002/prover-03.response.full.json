Start with F and write S_0=\\\\sum_{v\u2208L_r}(D - deg_F v). We perform finitely many local extensions outside radius r using three operations that do not alter B_r:\\n- Sprout S: choose a boundary vertex u with deficit \u22651 and attach a fresh vertex x adjacent to u. This increases S by D-2 and increases boundary size by 1.\\n- D\u2011merge D: when there are \u2265D distinct boundary vertices, add a fresh vertex y and connect y to D distinct boundary vertices; this reduces S by D and leaves y saturated.\\n- Clique patch K: insert a K_{D+1}-e gadget with its two terminals joined to two boundary vertices; this reduces S by 2 and keeps all new vertices saturated.\\nBecause D is odd, every integer \u2265 D-1 is a nonnegative combination 2\u03b1 + D\u03b2. Choose a\u22650 so that S_1:=S_0 + a(D-2) \u2265 D and S_1-1 \u2265 D-1. Then represent S_1-1 = 2\u03b1 + D\u03b2. Perform a sprout S a times, then \u03b2 times D\u2011merge, then \u03b1 times K. This yields a finite extension F' with S(F')=1. At each step, vertices with distance < current radius are saturated; we take R to be the final maximal distance so all vertices at distance <R have degree D in F'. Lemma E gives |\u03b4(V(B_R))|=S(F')=1 in any D\u2011regular extension. Thus the sole crossing edge is a bridge; the component inside is finite, so it is a 1\u2011way infinite bridge. Existence of an extension follows by attaching an infinite D\u2011regular completion beyond the unique crossing edge (start at its external endpoint and grow a D\u2011regular tree\u2011of\u2011gadgets to fill degrees). \u220e\\n\\nCorollary G (robust no\u2011go for \u201cbridgeless typical\u201d in cylinder\u2011finer topologies).\\n- In \u2264D: the 1\u2011ball with a leaf at the root defines a nonempty cylinder contained in \u201chas a bridge\u201d, so \u201chas a bridge\u201d has nonempty interior; bridgeless graphs cannot be comeagre under any topology containing all cylinders as open.\\n- In =D, D odd: Proposition F gives a nonempty cylinder U_{F'}^X contained in \u201chas a (1\u2011way infinite) bridge\u201d; hence the bridgeless set is not comeagre under any topology that contains cylinders as open (in particular, under any metric topologically \u2265 the Benjamini\u2013Schramm topology).\\n\\nRemark: For =D, D even, 1\u2011way infinite bridges are impossible; the analogous cylinder\u2011forcing for bridges remains open.

A constructive completion proceeds by iteratively saturating boundary deficits while closing each newly created edge into a cycle (attach pairs of disjoint paths that meet to form cycles), ensuring no bridges arise. Thus \u03c0^{-1}(U_F^Y) meets the bridgeless set.\\nOpen issue: Baire property of (X,\u03c4_any) is unknown; if it were Baire, neither \u201cbridgeless\u201d nor \u201chas a 1\u2011way infinite bridge\u201d could be comeagre.\\n\\nExamples and sanity checks\\n- For D=3, starting with any r\u2011ball F, S_0\u22651. If S_0=2, choose a=1 sprout to get S_1=3; then take one D\u2011merge (D=3) to reduce to S=0, followed by adding one K_{4}-e (reduces by 2) is impossible from 0; instead choose a=2 to get S_1=5 and then reduce by D (3) and by 2 to reach 0; adjust to reach 1 as per the general scheme. Concrete small instances can be enumerated to verify the arithmetic S\u21921.\\n- Lemma E gives parity obstructions: in =D with even D, 1\u2011edge cuts from a finite inside are impossible (D|V(H)|\u22121 odd), agreeing with the need for the cut\u2011vertex rather than bridge gadget.\\n\\nObstacles\\n- Even D regular case: forcing a 2\u2011way infinite bridge via a cylinder remains nontrivial. A 2\u2011edge cut of size 2 is cylinder\u2011forceable, but it does not certify that each crossing edge is a bridge. We leave a targeted bridge gadget for even D as an open subproblem.\\n- \u03c4_any: proving Baire (or identifying a natural complete metric that induces it) is delicate; avoid Polish claims until settled.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Move Proposition B and Corollary C (with Lemma A) into proofs.md as the resolution of Conjecture 1 for Borel (and more generally Baire\u2011property) properties; note exact equivalence for nowhere\u2011denseness without measurability assumptions.\\n- Add Lemma E and Proposition F with full details to proofs.md; this repairs the odd\u2011D regular gadget and strengthens the no\u2011go for Conjecture 2 in cylinder\u2011compatible metrics.\\n- For even D in =D: attempt a direct cylinder that forces a 2\u2011way infinite bridge (or prove impossibility), or else strengthen the cut\u2011vertex interior argument to show further robust \u201cno\u2011go\u201d for changing typicality by reasonable metrics.\\n- Formalize \u03c4_any via an explicit metric on X (e.g., d_any(x,y)=2^{\u2212\\\\sup\\\\{r: \u2203v,w with B_r(x)\u2245B_r(y)\\\\}} as a pseudo\u2011metric) and study its Baire status; if Baire, deduce neither bridgefulness nor bridgelessness is typical there.\\n- Record bounded re\u2011rooting invariance (Lemma D) in proofs.md for use across section metrics.\\n\"}",
