Ideas
- Settle Conjecture 1 rigorously via the forgetful map π from rooted to unrooted space: transfer of nowhere‑denseness and meagreness (for Baire‑property sets) is exact. This fixes earlier saturation pitfalls.
- Strengthen the “no‑go” region for Conjecture 2 by constructing explicit cylinders that force a bridge:
  • For ≤D: trivial leaf cylinder gives interior for “has a bridge”.
  • For =D and odd D: build a D‑regular, radius‑R cylinder with exactly one edge leaving the ball in any extension (hence a 1‑way infinite bridge). This repairs the previously flawed gadget.
- Add a bounded re‑rooting invariance lemma: section metrics differing by uniformly bounded re‑rooting are topologically equivalent to d_•.
- Outline a coarser “exist‑somewhere” topology τ_any (initial topology via π) and show density of both “has a 1‑way infinite bridge” and “is bridgeless” therein; leave Baire property open.

Rigorous results and proofs
1) Root‑invariance via π
Spaces:
- X = \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D} with the rooted local (Benjamini–Schramm) topology.
- Y = unrooted, connected, countably infinite graphs with Δ≤D (or =D), with the rootless local topology generated by sets U_F^Y = {G: ∃v, B_r(G,v)≅F}.
- π: X→Y, π(G,ρ)=G.

Lemma A (π is continuous, open, surjective).
Proof. For a rooted r‑ball F, π^{-1}(U_F^Y)=U_F^X is open in X (union of rooted cylinders at all roots realizing F). Conversely, π(U_F^X)=U_F^Y is open in Y. Surjectivity is clear. ∎

Proposition B (nowhere‑denseness transfers exactly).
For any A⊆Y: A is nowhere dense in Y iff π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X.
Proof. (⇒) Let A be nowhere dense in Y. For any nonempty open U⊆X, π(U) is nonempty and open in Y; pick nonempty open V⊆π(U) with V∩A=∅. Then U∩π^{-1}(V) is nonempty open and disjoint from π^{-1}(A). (⇐) If π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense and W⊆Y is nonempty open, then π^{-1}(W) is nonempty open; choose nonempty open U'⊆π^{-1}(W) with U'∩π^{-1}(A)=∅. Then π(U')⊆W is nonempty open with π(U')∩A=∅. ∎

Corollary C (meagreness transfers for Baire‑property sets).
If A⊆Y has the Baire property, then A is meagre in Y iff π^{-1}(A) is meagre in X.
Proof. (⇒) Preimages of meagre sets under continuous maps are meagre. (⇐) Suppose π^{-1}(A) is meagre but A is not; since A has the Baire property, some nonempty open V⊆Y has A∩V comeagre. Then π^{-1}(A∩V)=π^{-1}(A)∩π^{-1}(V) is comeagre in nonempty open π^{-1}(V), contradiction. ∎

Why useful: This settles Conjecture 1 for all “natural” P (Borel/analytic), including bridges, cut vertices, edge‑colouring, etc.; nowhere‑denseness holds even without Baire‑property assumptions.

2) Bounded re‑rooting invariance (section metrics)
Lemma D. Let T:X→X map (G,ρ)↦(G,ρ') with d_G(ρ,ρ')≤B uniformly. Then T is a homeomorphism of (X,d_•) onto its image; in particular, d_• and the pullback metric via T induce the same topology.
Proof. For each r, U_r(x)=\{y: B_r(y,root)≅B_r(x)\} maps into U_{r-B}(T(x)) and contains U_{r+B}(T(x)). Thus T and T^{-1} are continuous. ∎

3) A cut‑size identity
Lemma E. Let H be a finite induced subgraph of a D‑regular supergraph G. Then
|δ_G(V(H))| = \sum_{v∈V(H)} (D - deg_H v) = D|V(H)| - 2|E(H)|.
Proof. Sum degrees in G over V(H) equals D|V(H)|, which splits into 2|E(H)| plus edges of δ_G(V(H)). ∎

4) Odd‑D regular bridge‑forcing cylinder (repair of gadget)
Proposition F (bridge‑forcing in =D, D odd ≥3). Fix any rooted r‑ball F that occurs in \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}. There exists R≥r and an R‑ball F' extending F such that:
(i) every vertex at distance <R from the root in F' has degree D (in F');
(ii) S(F'):=\sum_{x∈L_R} (D - deg_{F'} x) = 1;
(iii) U_{F'}^X ≠ ∅ in \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D} and for every (G,ρ) with B_R(G,ρ)≅F', the unique edge of δ_G(V(B_R)) is a 1‑way infinite bridge.
Proof. Start with F and write S_0=\sum_{v∈L_r}(D - deg_F v). We perform finitely many local extensions outside radius r using three operations that do not alter B_r:
- Sprout S: choose a boundary vertex u with deficit ≥1 and attach a fresh vertex x adjacent to u. This increases S by D-2 and increases boundary size by 1.
- D‑merge D: when there are ≥D distinct boundary vertices, add a fresh vertex y and connect y to D distinct boundary vertices; this reduces S by D and leaves y saturated.
- Clique patch K: insert a K_{D+1}-e gadget with its two terminals joined to two boundary vertices; this reduces S by 2 and keeps all new vertices saturated.
Because D is odd, every integer ≥ D-1 is a nonnegative combination 2α + Dβ. Choose a≥0 so that S_1:=S_0 + a(D-2) ≥ D and S_1-1 ≥ D-1. Then represent S_1-1 = 2α + Dβ. Perform a sprout S a times, then β times D‑merge, then α times K. This yields a finite extension F' with S(F')=1. At each step, vertices with distance < current radius are saturated; we take R to be the final maximal distance so all vertices at distance <R have degree D in F'. Lemma E gives |δ(V(B_R))|=S(F')=1 in any D‑regular extension. Thus the sole crossing edge is a bridge; the component inside is finite, so it is a 1‑way infinite bridge. Existence of an extension follows by attaching an infinite D‑regular completion beyond the unique crossing edge (start at its external endpoint and grow a D‑regular tree‑of‑gadgets to fill degrees). ∎

Corollary G (robust no‑go for “bridgeless typical” in cylinder‑finer topologies).
- In ≤D: the 1‑ball with a leaf at the root defines a nonempty cylinder contained in “has a bridge”, so “has a bridge” has nonempty interior; bridgeless graphs cannot be comeagre under any topology containing all cylinders as open.
- In =D, D odd: Proposition F gives a nonempty cylinder U_{F'}^X contained in “has a (1‑way infinite) bridge”; hence the bridgeless set is not comeagre under any topology that contains cylinders as open (in particular, under any metric topologically ≥ the Benjamini–Schramm topology).

Remark: For =D, D even, 1‑way infinite bridges are impossible; the analogous cylinder‑forcing for bridges remains open. However, a cylinder forcing a cut vertex exists for all D (by concentrating all crossing edges at a single boundary vertex c), recovering Theorem 15 as “has a cut vertex” has interior.

5) Coarser “exist‑somewhere” topology τ_any
Definition. Let τ_any on X be the initial topology w.r.t. π, i.e., the coarsest topology making all sets π^{-1}(U_F^Y)= { (G,ρ): ∃v, B_r(G,v)≅F } open.

Density observations.
- “Has a 1‑way infinite bridge” is dense in (X,τ_any): given any basic open π^{-1}(U_F^Y), extend a graph containing F by attaching a pendant infinite ray somewhere disjoint from the F‑region; the result remains in π^{-1}(U_F^Y) and has a 1‑way infinite bridge.
- “Bridgeless” is also dense: given F, build an infinite 2‑edge‑connected (every edge lies on a cycle) graph containing F. A constructive completion proceeds by iteratively saturating boundary deficits while closing each newly created edge into a cycle (attach pairs of disjoint paths that meet to form cycles), ensuring no bridges arise. Thus π^{-1}(U_F^Y) meets the bridgeless set.
Open issue: Baire property of (X,τ_any) is unknown; if it were Baire, neither “bridgeless” nor “has a 1‑way infinite bridge” could be comeagre.

Examples and sanity checks
- For D=3, starting with any r‑ball F, S_0≥1. If S_0=2, choose a=1 sprout to get S_1=3; then take one D‑merge (D=3) to reduce to S=0, followed by adding one K_{4}-e (reduces by 2) is impossible from 0; instead choose a=2 to get S_1=5 and then reduce by D (3) and by 2 to reach 0; adjust to reach 1 as per the general scheme. Concrete small instances can be enumerated to verify the arithmetic S→1.
- Lemma E gives parity obstructions: in =D with even D, 1‑edge cuts from a finite inside are impossible (D|V(H)|−1 odd), agreeing with the need for the cut‑vertex rather than bridge gadget.

Obstacles
- Even D regular case: forcing a 2‑way infinite bridge via a cylinder remains nontrivial. A 2‑edge cut of size 2 is cylinder‑forceable, but it does not certify that each crossing edge is a bridge. We leave a targeted bridge gadget for even D as an open subproblem.
- τ_any: proving Baire (or identifying a natural complete metric that induces it) is delicate; avoid Polish claims until settled.

Next steps
- Move Proposition B and Corollary C (with Lemma A) into proofs.md as the resolution of Conjecture 1 for Borel (and more generally Baire‑property) properties; note exact equivalence for nowhere‑denseness without measurability assumptions.
- Add Lemma E and Proposition F with full details to proofs.md; this repairs the odd‑D regular gadget and strengthens the no‑go for Conjecture 2 in cylinder‑compatible metrics.
- For even D in =D: attempt a direct cylinder that forces a 2‑way infinite bridge (or prove impossibility), or else strengthen the cut‑vertex interior argument to show further robust “no‑go” for changing typicality by reasonable metrics.
- Formalize τ_any via an explicit metric on X (e.g., d_any(x,y)=2^{−\sup\{r: ∃v,w with B_r(x)≅B_r(y)\}} as a pseudo‑metric) and study its Baire status; if Baire, deduce neither bridgefulness nor bridgelessness is typical there.
- Record bounded re‑rooting invariance (Lemma D) in proofs.md for use across section metrics.
