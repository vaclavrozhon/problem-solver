Let \u03c0:X\u2192Y, \u03c0(G,\u03c1)=G. Then \u03c0 is continuous and open, and surjective.\\nProof. Continuity: \u03c0^{-1}(U_F^Y)=\u22c3_{v\u2208V(F)} \ud835\udd3e_{\\\\bullet}^{(F,v)}, an open union in \u03c4_\u2022. Openness: If V\u2286X is open and (G,\u03c1)\u2208V, then for some r we have \ud835\udd3e_{\\\\bullet}^{B_r(G,\u03c1)}\u2286V; but \u03c0(\ud835\udd3e_{\\\\bullet}^{B_r(G,\u03c1)})=U_{B_r(G,\u03c1)}^Y is open, hence \u03c0(V) is open. Surjectivity is immediate.\\n\\nProposition 1.2 (Root-invariance of nowhere denseness). For any A\u2286Y, A is nowhere dense in (Y,\u03c4\u2080) iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in (X,\u03c4_\u2022).\\nProof. If A is nowhere dense, then int(cl(A))=\u2205; continuity implies cl(\u03c0^{-1}(A))\u2286\u03c0^{-1}(cl(A)); openness implies int(\u03c0^{-1}(U))\u2286\u03c0^{-1}(int(U)). Thus int(cl(\u03c0^{-1}(A)))\u2286\u03c0^{-1}(int(cl(A)))=\u2205. Conversely, if \u03c0^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense and A had nonempty interior, choose nonempty open U\u2286A, then \u03c0^{-1}(U) is nonempty open \u2286 \u03c0^{-1}(A), contradiction.\\n\\nProposition 1.3 (Root-invariance of meagreness for BP sets). Suppose A\u2286Y has the Baire property in \u03c4\u2080 (e.g., A is Borel/analytic). Then A is meagre in Y iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) is meagre in X.\\nProof. If A is comeagre in Y, then there exists a dense G_\u03b4 set G\u2286A; by openness and continuity, \u03c0^{-1}(G) is dense G_\u03b4 in X, so \u03c0^{-1}(A) is comeagre. Conversely, if \u03c0^{-1}(A) is comeagre but A were meagre, then Y\\\\A contains a dense G_\u03b4 H; by openness, \u03c0^{-1}(H) is dense G_\u03b4 in X disjoint from \u03c0^{-1}(A), contradiction. The meagre direction is the complement.\\n\\nConclusion. Conjecture 1 holds for nowhere denseness (all A) and for meagreness for all sets with BP. In particular, for all natural graph properties P considered here, smallness is independent of the root.\\n\\n2) Bounded re-rooting invariance for section metrics\\n\\nLet s,t:Y\u2192X be \u201csections\u201d selecting a root in each unrooted graph. Define d_s(G,H)=d_\u2022( (G,s(G)), (H,s(H)) ).\\n\\nLemma 2.1 (Uniformly bounded re-rootings give equivalent topologies). If there exists K\u2208\u2115 such that dist_G(s(G),t(G))\u2264K for all G\u2208Y, then the identity map (Y,d_s)\u2192(Y,d_t) is a homeomorphism. In fact, d_t \u2264 2^{K}\u00b7d_s and d_s \u2264 2^{K}\u00b7d_t.\\nProof. If B_r(G,s(G))\u2245B_r(H,s(H)), then B_{r-K}(G,t(G))\u2245B_{r-K}(H,t(H)) for r\u2265K; hence d_t((G),(H))\u22642^{K}\u00b7d_s((G),(H)). Symmetry yields the other inequality.\\n\\nWhy useful: typicality cannot change across such section metrics; partial positive progress on Conj. 1 beyond \u03c0-transfer.\\n\\n3) FLP no-go for D-regular (D odd): corrected gadget\\n\\nFinite-lens property (FLP): A metric d on X=\ud835\udd3e_{\\\\bullet,D} has FLP if every d-open neighborhood contains a multi-ball cylinder W(M) determined by finitely many marked vertices and a finite radius, i.e., all completions must realize a specified finite marked graph M on the union of their radius-r balls around those marks.\\n\\nTheorem 3.1 (Bridgeless is nowhere dense under any FLP metric; =D odd). Fix odd D\u22653. In (X,d) with FLP, BrFree={bridgeless graphs} is nowhere dense.\\n\\nExplicit bridge-forcing seed. For odd D\u22653, let n=D+2 (odd). Take the complete graph K_n and label distinct vertices x,a,b, and the remaining set W (|W|=D\u22121, which is even). Form S by removing the two edges xa, xb and removing a perfect matching on W. Then in S: deg(x)=D\u22121 and for all v\u2260x, deg(v)=D. S is connected.\\n\\nRefinement construction. Let O be a nonempty d-open set; by FLP O\u2287W(M) for some finite marked M. Choose a fresh region (disjoint from M\u2019s marks and their r-balls), and graft an isomorphic copy of S there. Define M\u2032 by adding all vertices of S to the marked finite pattern and pinning the full radius-1 neighborhood of each vertex of S exactly as in S. Let W\u2032=W(M\u2032); then W\u2032 is a nonempty d-open set with W\u2032\u2286O.\\n\\nBridge in every completion. For any (G,\u03c1)\u2208W\u2032, all vertices v\u2208S\\\\{x} already have D neighbors entirely inside S (pinned), hence cannot have external neighbors (the space is =D). The vertex x has exactly D\u22121 neighbors in S (pinned), so in any D-regular completion it must receive exactly one outside neighbor y\u2209S. Therefore, the only edge connecting S to G\\\\S is xy. As S is connected, the edge xy is a bridge in G; removing it separates S from G\\\\S.\\n\\nTherefore O contains a nonempty open subset disjoint from BrFree. As O was arbitrary, BrFree is nowhere dense.\\n\\nRemarks.\\n- The parity obstruction explains the even-D regular case: in a D-regular finite S, the number of cross edges |\u03b4(S)|\u2261D|S| (mod 2), so a single cross edge is impossible for even D. This aligns with the abstract\u2019s shift to cut vertices when D is even.\\n- The \u2264D case needs no parity gadget: attach a pendant vertex z to any boundary vertex b with deg(b)<D inside the cylinder; pin z\u2019s radius-1 neighborhood to force bz to be a bridge in all completions. This reproduces the known argument under FLP.\\n\\nCorollary 3.2. Under any FLP metric on \ud835\udd3e_{\\\\bullet,=D} for odd D (and on \ud835\udd3e_{\\\\bullet,\u2264D} for all D\u22653), bridgeless graphs are not typical (indeed, nowhere dense). Hence, Conjecture 2 has a strong negative answer on the entire FLP class.\\n\\n4) Finer-topology no-go\\n\\nProposition 4.1 (Nowhere denseness persists under refinement). If \u03c4\u2082 refines \u03c4\u2081 on the same set X and S is nowhere dense in (X,\u03c4\u2081), then S is nowhere dense in (X,\u03c4\u2082).\\nProof. cl_{\u03c4\u2082}(S)\u2286cl_{\u03c4\u2081}(S) and int_{\u03c4\u2082}(\u00b7)\u2286int_{\u03c4\u2081}(\u00b7); thus int_{\u03c4\u2082}(cl_{\u03c4\u2082}(S))\u2286int_{\u03c4\u2081}(cl_{\u03c4\u2081}(S))=\u2205.\\n\\nConsequence: No metric finer than Benjamini\u2013Schramm can make BrFree typical.\\n\\n5) A coarser, rootless-local proximity and a density result\\n\\nDefine on Y (unrooted) the topology \u03c4_any generated by the basic opens U_F^Y={G: \u2203v, B_r(G,v)\u2245F}. This is coarser than the quotient of \u03c4_\u2022 and is \u201croot-insensitive\u201d.\\n\\nLemma 5.1 (Density of 1-way infinite bridges in \u03c4_any; \u2264D). For D\u22653 in \ud835\udd3e_{\\\\le D}, the set B\u2081 of graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge is dense in (Y,\u03c4_any).\\nProof. Let U_F^Y be a nonempty basic open. Take any infinite completion G\u2080 containing a copy of F. Outside that copy, add a new infinite ray R and connect its initial vertex to an interior vertex u of F by a single edge e (keeping degrees \u2264D by choosing u with spare capacity or by locally modifying within a bounded-degree buffer). Complete the rest arbitrarily preserving degree bound and connectivity. Then e is a 1-way infinite bridge, and the r-ball around the chosen vertex in F is unchanged, so the resulting graph lies in U_F^Y. Hence B\u2081 is dense.\\n\\nRemark. A symmetric argument often shows \u201cbridgeless\u201d is also dense in \u03c4_any (by completing to a 2-edge-connected infinite graph while preserving the local pattern), suggesting that typicality may not stabilize under such coarse topologies. Determining whether (Y,\u03c4_any) is Baire (or Polish) is open here; if it were Baire, two disjoint dense sets cannot both be comeagre, constraining typicality.\\n\\n6) Examples, checks, and counterchecks\\n\\n- Existence of the seed S for D odd was made explicit via K_{D+2} minus a matching and two incident edges; it satisfies deg(x)=D\u22121, others D, and |V(S)|=D+2 is odd, passing the handshake parity check.\\n- Even D regular: a single external edge from a finite pinned region S to its complement contradicts |\u03b4(S)| even; thus the \u201csingle-slot\u201d mechanism is obstructed, explaining the qualitative difference noted in the abstract (switch to cut vertices).\\n- Section metrics: if two root selectors differ by O(1) distances, category statements are unchanged by Lemma 2.1.\\n\\nObstacles and open directions\\n\\n- For Conjecture 2 positive direction, any metric that could make BrFree typical must be strictly coarser than BS and outside FLP. Natural candidates (\u03c4_any above) need a careful analysis of Baire-ness; without Baire, typicality is ill-behaved.\\n- Global re-rootings that are not continuous (nonlocal) do not preserve category a priori; Conjecture 1 as a universal statement beyond BP sets on the unrooted space might require a descriptive-set-theoretic refinement.\\n\\nNext steps (actionable)\\n\\n- Move Lemma 1.1, Propositions 1.2\u20131.3 to proofs.md to settle Conjecture 1 for BP sets.\\n- Add Theorem 3.1 and Corollary 3.2 (with the explicit S gadget) to proofs.md, replacing the flawed \u201cregular bridge gadget\u201d step.\\n- For \u03c4_any (and similar rootless local topologies), study: (i) is \u03c4_any Baire on the degree-bounded unrooted space? (ii) are BrFree and B\u2081 both dense? If yes and Baire, neither is typical; if not Baire, devise an alternative coarser but Baire metric.\\n- Extend FLP no-go to the even D regular setting for \u201cno cut vertex\u201d as the forced property (adapting the single-slot scheme to a \u201csingle-slot vertex-cut\u201d gadget consistent with even parity).\\n\\nWhy these are useful\\n\\n- The corrected FLP argument eliminates a critical gap and broadly rules out Conjecture 2 within the most natural class of local metrics.\\n- The \u03c0-transfer crystallizes Conjecture 1 into a general, reusable tool independent of the choice of root.\\n- The bounded re-rooting lemma secures robustness across section metrics.\\n- The rootless-local density result identifies a concrete coarser regime where behavior changes, guiding the search for a metric with genuinely different typicality.\\n\"}",
