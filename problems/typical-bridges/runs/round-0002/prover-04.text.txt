Focus of this round

- Fix the flawed step in the FLP (finite-lens) no-go for D-regular, D odd, by giving an explicit, pinned, degree-exact gadget that forces a bridge in every completion.
- Formalize and record the π-transfer for Conjecture 1 (root-invariance): nowhere denseness and meagreness (for Baire-property sets) are preserved under the forgetful map from rooted to unrooted spaces.
- Add a bounded re-rooting invariance lemma for section metrics.
- Give a clean no-go for any finer topology (than BS) to make bridgeless typical.
- Provide a rootless-local coarser proximity with a density result for 1-way infinite bridges; Baire status left open.

1) Conjecture 1: π-transfer formalized

Let X=𝔾_{\bullet,D} with the Benjamini–Schramm topology τ_•, and let Y be the set of unrooted, countably infinite, connected graphs with Δ≤D (or =D), endowed with the rootless-local topology τ₀ generated by cylinders U_F^Y={G∈Y: ∃v, B_r(G,v)≅F}.

Lemma 1.1 (π is continuous, open, surjective). Let π:X→Y, π(G,ρ)=G. Then π is continuous and open, and surjective.
Proof. Continuity: π^{-1}(U_F^Y)=⋃_{v∈V(F)} 𝔾_{\bullet}^{(F,v)}, an open union in τ_•. Openness: If V⊆X is open and (G,ρ)∈V, then for some r we have 𝔾_{\bullet}^{B_r(G,ρ)}⊆V; but π(𝔾_{\bullet}^{B_r(G,ρ)})=U_{B_r(G,ρ)}^Y is open, hence π(V) is open. Surjectivity is immediate.

Proposition 1.2 (Root-invariance of nowhere denseness). For any A⊆Y, A is nowhere dense in (Y,τ₀) iff π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in (X,τ_•).
Proof. If A is nowhere dense, then int(cl(A))=∅; continuity implies cl(π^{-1}(A))⊆π^{-1}(cl(A)); openness implies int(π^{-1}(U))⊆π^{-1}(int(U)). Thus int(cl(π^{-1}(A)))⊆π^{-1}(int(cl(A)))=∅. Conversely, if π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense and A had nonempty interior, choose nonempty open U⊆A, then π^{-1}(U) is nonempty open ⊆ π^{-1}(A), contradiction.

Proposition 1.3 (Root-invariance of meagreness for BP sets). Suppose A⊆Y has the Baire property in τ₀ (e.g., A is Borel/analytic). Then A is meagre in Y iff π^{-1}(A) is meagre in X.
Proof. If A is comeagre in Y, then there exists a dense G_δ set G⊆A; by openness and continuity, π^{-1}(G) is dense G_δ in X, so π^{-1}(A) is comeagre. Conversely, if π^{-1}(A) is comeagre but A were meagre, then Y\A contains a dense G_δ H; by openness, π^{-1}(H) is dense G_δ in X disjoint from π^{-1}(A), contradiction. The meagre direction is the complement.

Conclusion. Conjecture 1 holds for nowhere denseness (all A) and for meagreness for all sets with BP. In particular, for all natural graph properties P considered here, smallness is independent of the root.

2) Bounded re-rooting invariance for section metrics

Let s,t:Y→X be “sections” selecting a root in each unrooted graph. Define d_s(G,H)=d_•( (G,s(G)), (H,s(H)) ).

Lemma 2.1 (Uniformly bounded re-rootings give equivalent topologies). If there exists K∈ℕ such that dist_G(s(G),t(G))≤K for all G∈Y, then the identity map (Y,d_s)→(Y,d_t) is a homeomorphism. In fact, d_t ≤ 2^{K}·d_s and d_s ≤ 2^{K}·d_t.
Proof. If B_r(G,s(G))≅B_r(H,s(H)), then B_{r-K}(G,t(G))≅B_{r-K}(H,t(H)) for r≥K; hence d_t((G),(H))≤2^{K}·d_s((G),(H)). Symmetry yields the other inequality.

Why useful: typicality cannot change across such section metrics; partial positive progress on Conj. 1 beyond π-transfer.

3) FLP no-go for D-regular (D odd): corrected gadget

Finite-lens property (FLP): A metric d on X=𝔾_{\bullet,D} has FLP if every d-open neighborhood contains a multi-ball cylinder W(M) determined by finitely many marked vertices and a finite radius, i.e., all completions must realize a specified finite marked graph M on the union of their radius-r balls around those marks.

Theorem 3.1 (Bridgeless is nowhere dense under any FLP metric; =D odd). Fix odd D≥3. In (X,d) with FLP, BrFree={bridgeless graphs} is nowhere dense.

Explicit bridge-forcing seed. For odd D≥3, let n=D+2 (odd). Take the complete graph K_n and label distinct vertices x,a,b, and the remaining set W (|W|=D−1, which is even). Form S by removing the two edges xa, xb and removing a perfect matching on W. Then in S: deg(x)=D−1 and for all v≠x, deg(v)=D. S is connected.

Refinement construction. Let O be a nonempty d-open set; by FLP O⊇W(M) for some finite marked M. Choose a fresh region (disjoint from M’s marks and their r-balls), and graft an isomorphic copy of S there. Define M′ by adding all vertices of S to the marked finite pattern and pinning the full radius-1 neighborhood of each vertex of S exactly as in S. Let W′=W(M′); then W′ is a nonempty d-open set with W′⊆O.

Bridge in every completion. For any (G,ρ)∈W′, all vertices v∈S\{x} already have D neighbors entirely inside S (pinned), hence cannot have external neighbors (the space is =D). The vertex x has exactly D−1 neighbors in S (pinned), so in any D-regular completion it must receive exactly one outside neighbor y∉S. Therefore, the only edge connecting S to G\S is xy. As S is connected, the edge xy is a bridge in G; removing it separates S from G\S.

Therefore O contains a nonempty open subset disjoint from BrFree. As O was arbitrary, BrFree is nowhere dense.

Remarks.
- The parity obstruction explains the even-D regular case: in a D-regular finite S, the number of cross edges |δ(S)|≡D|S| (mod 2), so a single cross edge is impossible for even D. This aligns with the abstract’s shift to cut vertices when D is even.
- The ≤D case needs no parity gadget: attach a pendant vertex z to any boundary vertex b with deg(b)<D inside the cylinder; pin z’s radius-1 neighborhood to force bz to be a bridge in all completions. This reproduces the known argument under FLP.

Corollary 3.2. Under any FLP metric on 𝔾_{\bullet,=D} for odd D (and on 𝔾_{\bullet,≤D} for all D≥3), bridgeless graphs are not typical (indeed, nowhere dense). Hence, Conjecture 2 has a strong negative answer on the entire FLP class.

4) Finer-topology no-go

Proposition 4.1 (Nowhere denseness persists under refinement). If τ₂ refines τ₁ on the same set X and S is nowhere dense in (X,τ₁), then S is nowhere dense in (X,τ₂).
Proof. cl_{τ₂}(S)⊆cl_{τ₁}(S) and int_{τ₂}(·)⊆int_{τ₁}(·); thus int_{τ₂}(cl_{τ₂}(S))⊆int_{τ₁}(cl_{τ₁}(S))=∅.

Consequence: No metric finer than Benjamini–Schramm can make BrFree typical.

5) A coarser, rootless-local proximity and a density result

Define on Y (unrooted) the topology τ_any generated by the basic opens U_F^Y={G: ∃v, B_r(G,v)≅F}. This is coarser than the quotient of τ_• and is “root-insensitive”.

Lemma 5.1 (Density of 1-way infinite bridges in τ_any; ≤D). For D≥3 in 𝔾_{\le D}, the set B₁ of graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge is dense in (Y,τ_any).
Proof. Let U_F^Y be a nonempty basic open. Take any infinite completion G₀ containing a copy of F. Outside that copy, add a new infinite ray R and connect its initial vertex to an interior vertex u of F by a single edge e (keeping degrees ≤D by choosing u with spare capacity or by locally modifying within a bounded-degree buffer). Complete the rest arbitrarily preserving degree bound and connectivity. Then e is a 1-way infinite bridge, and the r-ball around the chosen vertex in F is unchanged, so the resulting graph lies in U_F^Y. Hence B₁ is dense.

Remark. A symmetric argument often shows “bridgeless” is also dense in τ_any (by completing to a 2-edge-connected infinite graph while preserving the local pattern), suggesting that typicality may not stabilize under such coarse topologies. Determining whether (Y,τ_any) is Baire (or Polish) is open here; if it were Baire, two disjoint dense sets cannot both be comeagre, constraining typicality.

6) Examples, checks, and counterchecks

- Existence of the seed S for D odd was made explicit via K_{D+2} minus a matching and two incident edges; it satisfies deg(x)=D−1, others D, and |V(S)|=D+2 is odd, passing the handshake parity check.
- Even D regular: a single external edge from a finite pinned region S to its complement contradicts |δ(S)| even; thus the “single-slot” mechanism is obstructed, explaining the qualitative difference noted in the abstract (switch to cut vertices).
- Section metrics: if two root selectors differ by O(1) distances, category statements are unchanged by Lemma 2.1.

Obstacles and open directions

- For Conjecture 2 positive direction, any metric that could make BrFree typical must be strictly coarser than BS and outside FLP. Natural candidates (τ_any above) need a careful analysis of Baire-ness; without Baire, typicality is ill-behaved.
- Global re-rootings that are not continuous (nonlocal) do not preserve category a priori; Conjecture 1 as a universal statement beyond BP sets on the unrooted space might require a descriptive-set-theoretic refinement.

Next steps (actionable)

- Move Lemma 1.1, Propositions 1.2–1.3 to proofs.md to settle Conjecture 1 for BP sets.
- Add Theorem 3.1 and Corollary 3.2 (with the explicit S gadget) to proofs.md, replacing the flawed “regular bridge gadget” step.
- For τ_any (and similar rootless local topologies), study: (i) is τ_any Baire on the degree-bounded unrooted space? (ii) are BrFree and B₁ both dense? If yes and Baire, neither is typical; if not Baire, devise an alternative coarser but Baire metric.
- Extend FLP no-go to the even D regular setting for “no cut vertex” as the forced property (adapting the single-slot scheme to a “single-slot vertex-cut” gadget consistent with even parity).

Why these are useful

- The corrected FLP argument eliminates a critical gap and broadly rules out Conjecture 2 within the most natural class of local metrics.
- The π-transfer crystallizes Conjecture 1 into a general, reusable tool independent of the choice of root.
- The bounded re-rooting lemma secures robustness across section metrics.
- The rootless-local density result identifies a concrete coarser regime where behavior changes, guiding the search for a metric with genuinely different typicality.
