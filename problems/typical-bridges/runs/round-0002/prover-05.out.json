  "content": "Ideas\n\n- Set up a clean rooted\u2192unrooted quotient framework and prove that nowhere\u2011denseness is root\u2011invariant, and meagreness is root\u2011invariant for sets with the Baire property. This settles Conjecture 1 for all natural graph properties handled so far (bridges, cut vertices, \u03c7\u2032=D, etc.).\n- Strengthen the \u201cno\u2011go\u201d zone for Conjecture 2: any topology whose neighborhoods admit rooted cylinders as a neighborhood base inherits the uniform forcing arguments, hence \u201cbridgeless\u201d remains nowhere dense. Provide a corrected odd\u2011D regular gadget to close the gap flagged in the feedback.\n- Test a coarser \u201ctail\u201d topology: show that the set \u201chas a bridge\u201d has nonempty interior there, so bridgeless cannot be comeagre if the space is Baire; thus tail\u2011type metrics cannot make bridgeless typical.\n\nQuotient framework and root\u2011invariance (Conjecture 1)\n\nLet X=\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,D} with the Benjamini\u2013Schramm (BS) metric topology. Let Y be the set of unrooted, connected, countable graphs with \u0394\u2264D (or =D) endowed with the rootless\u2011local topology generated by the subbasis {U_F^Y: F a rooted r\u2011ball, U_F^Y={G\u2208Y: \u2203v B_r(G,v)\u2245F}}. Let \u03c0:X\u2192Y be the forgetful map \u03c0(G,\u03c1)=G.\n\nLemma 1 (quotient map; openness). \u03c0 is continuous, open, surjective and Y carries the quotient topology of X under \u03c0: a set U\u2286Y is open iff \u03c0^{-1}(U) is open in X.\nProof. Continuity: \u03c0^{-1}(U_F^Y)=\u22c3_{v\u2208V(F)} \\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^{(F,v)} is open in X. Surjectivity is trivial. Openness: any open W\u2286X is a union of cylinders; for x\u2208W pick a cylinder \\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^{F} with x\u2208\\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^F\u2286W; then \u03c0(\\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^F)=U_F^Y is open and contains \u03c0(x), so \u03c0(W)=\u22c3 U_F^Y is open. Finally, by the previous two sentences, U\u2286Y is open iff \u03c0^{-1}(U) is open, i.e., Y is the quotient of X by \u03c0.\n\nLemma 2 (closure transport). For all A\u2286Y, \u03c0^{-1}(\\overline{A}^Y)=\\overline{\u03c0^{-1}(A)}^X.\nProof. This is the standard property of quotient maps: closed sets in Y are exactly those C with \u03c0^{-1}(C) closed in X; taking intersections over all such C\u2287A yields the claim.\n\nTheorem 3 (nowhere\u2011dense equivalence). For all A\u2286Y, A is nowhere dense in Y iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X.\nProof. (\u21d2) If A is nowhere dense then int_Y(\\overline{A}^Y)=\u2205. Suppose int_X(\\overline{\u03c0^{-1}(A)}^X)\u2260\u2205; pick a nonempty open U\u2286\\overline{\u03c0^{-1}(A)}^X. By Lemma 1, \u03c0(U) is nonempty open in Y and by Lemma 2, \u03c0(U)\u2286\\overline{A}^Y, contradicting emptiness of its interior. Hence int_X(\\overline{\u03c0^{-1}(A)}^X)=\u2205.\n(\u21d0) If \u03c0^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense, assume int_Y(\\overline{A}^Y)\u2260\u2205 with nonempty open V\u2286\\overline{A}^Y. Then \u03c0^{-1}(V) is nonempty open in X and by Lemma 2, \u03c0^{-1}(V)\u2286\\overline{\u03c0^{-1}(A)}^X, contradicting the nowhere denseness of \u03c0^{-1}(A).\n\nCorollary 4 (meagreness reflected for Baire\u2011property sets). Assume A\u2286Y has the Baire property. Then A is meagre in Y iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) is meagre in X.\nProof. (\u21d2) Immediate since preimages of nowhere dense sets are nowhere dense by Theorem 3. (\u21d0) Suppose \u03c0^{-1}(A) is meagre. By the Baire property, \u2203 open U\u2286Y with A\u25b3U meagre. Then \u03c0^{-1}(A)\u25b3\u03c0^{-1}(U) is meagre in X, so \u03c0^{-1}(U) is meagre+meagre = meagre. But \u03c0^{-1}(U) is nonempty open (if U\u2260\u2205), impossible in the Baire space X; hence U=\u2205 and A is meagre.\n\nConsequences. For any unrooted graph property P for which A_P={G\u2208Y: G has P} has the Baire property (e.g., Borel/analytic), S_P=\u03c0^{-1}(A_P) is nowhere dense/meagre in X iff A_P is nowhere dense/meagre in Y. This establishes Conjecture 1 in full generality for the properties treated in the extended abstract (and many others).\n\nSection metrics and bounded re\u2011rooting\n\nLet s be a section Y\u2192X (chooses a root in each unrooted graph). Define a metric d_s on Y by d_s(G,H)=d_\\bullet((G,s(G)),(H,s(H))).\n\nProposition 5 (bounded re\u2011rooting equivalence). If sections s,t satisfy dist_G(s(G),t(G))\u2264R_0 for all G, then id:(Y,d_s)\u2192(Y,d_t) is a homeomorphism. In particular, meagre/nowhere\u2011dense status is root\u2011invariant across such section metrics.\nProof. If B_r(G,s(G))\u2245B_r(H,s(H)), then B_{r\u2212R_0}(G,t(G))\u2245B_{r\u2212R_0}(H,t(H)) for r\u2265R_0, giving continuity in both directions.\n\nA corrected odd\u2011D regular bridge\u2011forcing gadget\n\nWe give an explicit and verifiable refinement of the parity gadget needed in the D\u2011regular, odd D case, usable in any argument that relies on rooted cylinders.\n\nDefinition (port gadget Q_D). For odd D\u22653, let Q_D be K_{D+1} with one missing edge ab. Then all vertices except a,b have degree D; vertices a,b have degree D\u22121.\n\nLemma 6 (pairwise deficit reduction). Let F be a rooted r\u2011ball in a D\u2011regular graph (odd D), and let L be its boundary. Write f(v)=D\u2212deg_F(v) for v\u2208L and \u03b4(F)=\u03a3_{v\u2208L} f(v). If v\u2260w are boundary vertices with f(v),f(w)\u22651, then by adding a disjoint copy of Q_D and identifying a with v, b with w (and keeping all Q_D internal edges), we obtain a refined ball F\u2032 whose interior degrees remain \u2264D, whose newly added vertices are all of degree D inside F\u2032, and for which \u03b4(F\u2032)=\u03b4(F)\u22122.\nProof. After identification, a and b gain one extra incident edge (to v,w respectively), raising their degrees to D; all other vertices of Q_D already have degree D. Internal degrees of v and w in F increase by one, so f(v),f(w) each drop by one; no new boundary vertices are created; hence \u03b4 drops by 2.\n\nProposition 7 (forcing \u03b4=1). Starting from any rooted r\u2011ball F in a D\u2011regular graph with odd D, there exists r\u2032 and a refinement F\u2032 such that \u03b4(F\u2032)=1. Moreover, F\u2032 is realizable as a rooted r\u2032\u2011ball in \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,=D}.\nProof. Repeatedly apply Lemma 6, pairing boundary vertices with positive deficits until no such pair remains. Each step preserves \u201cinternal degrees \u2264D\u201d and creates no new boundary vertices. Since \u03b4(F)\u2261|V(F)|\u00b7D\u22122|E(F)|\u2261|V(F)| (mod 2) and D is odd, \u03b4(F) is odd; hence the minimal achievable value under \u22122 decrements is 1. The result is a finite extension F\u2032 with \u03b4(F\u2032)=1.\n\nCorollary 8 (bridge forcing in any D\u2011regular extension). Let F\u2032 be as in Proposition 7 and let S be its vertex set. In any D\u2011regular extension G of F\u2032, the number of edges between S and V(G)\\S equals \u03b4(F\u2032)=1; hence that unique edge is a 1\u2011way infinite bridge.\nProof. In any D\u2011regular extension, the number of cross edges is \u03a3_{v\u2208S}(D\u2212deg_S(v))=\u03b4(F\u2032)=1. Removing that edge disconnects the finite set S from the infinite complement.\n\nTherefore, for every rooted cylinder \\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^F there exists a subcylinder \\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^{F\u2032} contained in its closure such that every extension has a (1\u2011way infinite) bridge. This corrects and completes the gadget argument in odd D.\n\nA robust \u201cno\u2011go\u201d region for Conjecture 2\n\nDefinition (cylinder\u2011based topology). A topology \u03c4 on X is cylinder\u2011based if for every x\u2208X and every \u03c4\u2011open set U\u220bx there exists an r\u2011ball F with x\u2208\\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^F\u2286U.\n\nTheorem 9 (bridgeless remains nowhere dense in any cylinder\u2011based topology). In any \u03c4 as above (on \u2264D or =D with odd D), the set of bridgeless rooted graphs is nowhere dense.\nProof. Given a nonempty \u03c4\u2011open U, pick x\u2208U and a rooted cylinder \\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^F with x\u2208\\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^F\u2286U. By the degree\u2011bounded argument (\u2264D) or by Proposition 7 (odd D), there exists F\u2032\u2ab0F such that every extension of F\u2032 contains a bridge. Then \\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^{F\u2032} is \u03c4\u2011open, nonempty, \\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^{F\u2032}\u2286U, and \\mathbf{G}_\\bullet^{F\u2032} contains no bridgeless graph.\n\nSection metrics d_s are cylinder\u2011based (cylinders relative to s(G) form a neighborhood base), hence bridgeless remains nowhere dense for all section metrics.\n\nA coarser \u201ctail\u201d topology cannot make bridgeless comeagre\n\nDefine the tail subbasis at (G,\u03c1) by the sets U_R(G,\u03c1) of all (H,\u03c3) for which there is a root\u2011preserving isomorphism between G\\B_R(G,\u03c1) and H\\B_R(H,\u03c3) mapping the boundary sphere to the boundary sphere. This topology is strictly coarser than the BS topology and is natural for studying \u201cend behavior.\u201d\n\nObservation 10 (bridging has nonempty interior in the tail topology). If (G,\u03c1) has a bridge e outside B_R(G,\u03c1), then every (H,\u03c3)\u2208U_R(G,\u03c1) has a corresponding bridge in H (the isomorphism fixes the outside where the bridge lies). Thus the set \u201chas a bridge\u201d contains U_R(G,\u03c1) and hence has nonempty interior.\n\nConclusion. If the tail space is Baire (open problem to settle rigorously), the set of bridgeless graphs cannot be comeagre there. Hence tail\u2011type metrics cannot make bridgeless typical.\n\nExamples and checks\n\n- Root\u2011invariance: Theorems 3 and Corollary 4 immediately yield that all results Theorems 14\u201317 are independent of the root choice (and of section metrics boundedly re\u2011rooting equivalent).\n- Odd\u2011D gadget sanity check: For D=3, Q_3=K_4\u2212e. Each application reduces \u03b4 by 2 without creating new boundary deficits. Iterating yields \u03b4=1 and forces exactly one cross edge in any 3\u2011regular extension.\n\nObstacles\n\n- For meagreness without assuming the Baire property of A\u2286Y, the implication \u03c0^{-1}(A) meagre \u21d2 A meagre can fail in general for quotient maps. Restricting to Baire\u2011property sets is both natural and sufficient here.\n- Alternative metrics: To actually produce a metric changing typicality (beyond the no\u2011go region), one needs a topology where basic neighborhoods need not contain any rooted cylinder and which is provably Baire; constructing such a topology with a clean combinatorial neighborhood description remains open.\n\nNext steps\n\n- Move Lemmas 1\u20132, Theorem 3, and Corollary 4 into proofs.md with full details and references (quotient maps, Baire spaces, open images of Baire spaces).\n- Record Proposition 7 and Corollary 8 (odd\u2011D gadget) in proofs.md; this also patches the FLP/even\u2011odd parity construction noted in the feedback.\n- Formalize the tail topology and settle its Baire status; if Baire, Observation 10 implies bridgeless is not comeagre there.\n- Explore a \u201cpattern\u2011inclusion\u201d ultrametric on Y based on equality of sets of rooted r\u2011balls S_r(G); verify ultrametricity on the quotient and analyze the category of bridge\u2011related sets. Prove or refute that both \u201chas a bridge\u201d and \u201cbridgeless\u201d have empty interior in this topology.\n"
