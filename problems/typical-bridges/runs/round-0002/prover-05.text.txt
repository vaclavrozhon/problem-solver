Ideas

- Set up a clean rooted→unrooted quotient framework and prove that nowhere‑denseness is root‑invariant, and meagreness is root‑invariant for sets with the Baire property. This settles Conjecture 1 for all natural graph properties handled so far (bridges, cut vertices, χ′=D, etc.).
- Strengthen the “no‑go” zone for Conjecture 2: any topology whose neighborhoods admit rooted cylinders as a neighborhood base inherits the uniform forcing arguments, hence “bridgeless” remains nowhere dense. Provide a corrected odd‑D regular gadget to close the gap flagged in the feedback.
- Test a coarser “tail” topology: show that the set “has a bridge” has nonempty interior there, so bridgeless cannot be comeagre if the space is Baire; thus tail‑type metrics cannot make bridgeless typical.

Quotient framework and root‑invariance (Conjecture 1)

Let X=\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D} with the Benjamini–Schramm (BS) metric topology. Let Y be the set of unrooted, connected, countable graphs with Δ≤D (or =D) endowed with the rootless‑local topology generated by the subbasis {U_F^Y: F a rooted r‑ball, U_F^Y={G∈Y: ∃v B_r(G,v)≅F}}. Let π:X→Y be the forgetful map π(G,ρ)=G.

Lemma 1 (quotient map; openness). π is continuous, open, surjective and Y carries the quotient topology of X under π: a set U⊆Y is open iff π^{-1}(U) is open in X.
Proof. Continuity: π^{-1}(U_F^Y)=⋃_{v∈V(F)} \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{(F,v)} is open in X. Surjectivity is trivial. Openness: any open W⊆X is a union of cylinders; for x∈W pick a cylinder \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F} with x∈\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F⊆W; then π(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F)=U_F^Y is open and contains π(x), so π(W)=⋃ U_F^Y is open. Finally, by the previous two sentences, U⊆Y is open iff π^{-1}(U) is open, i.e., Y is the quotient of X by π.

Lemma 2 (closure transport). For all A⊆Y, π^{-1}(\overline{A}^Y)=\overline{π^{-1}(A)}^X.
Proof. This is the standard property of quotient maps: closed sets in Y are exactly those C with π^{-1}(C) closed in X; taking intersections over all such C⊇A yields the claim.

Theorem 3 (nowhere‑dense equivalence). For all A⊆Y, A is nowhere dense in Y iff π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X.
Proof. (⇒) If A is nowhere dense then int_Y(\overline{A}^Y)=∅. Suppose int_X(\overline{π^{-1}(A)}^X)≠∅; pick a nonempty open U⊆\overline{π^{-1}(A)}^X. By Lemma 1, π(U) is nonempty open in Y and by Lemma 2, π(U)⊆\overline{A}^Y, contradicting emptiness of its interior. Hence int_X(\overline{π^{-1}(A)}^X)=∅.
(⇐) If π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense, assume int_Y(\overline{A}^Y)≠∅ with nonempty open V⊆\overline{A}^Y. Then π^{-1}(V) is nonempty open in X and by Lemma 2, π^{-1}(V)⊆\overline{π^{-1}(A)}^X, contradicting the nowhere denseness of π^{-1}(A).

Corollary 4 (meagreness reflected for Baire‑property sets). Assume A⊆Y has the Baire property. Then A is meagre in Y iff π^{-1}(A) is meagre in X.
Proof. (⇒) Immediate since preimages of nowhere dense sets are nowhere dense by Theorem 3. (⇐) Suppose π^{-1}(A) is meagre. By the Baire property, ∃ open U⊆Y with A△U meagre. Then π^{-1}(A)△π^{-1}(U) is meagre in X, so π^{-1}(U) is meagre+meagre = meagre. But π^{-1}(U) is nonempty open (if U≠∅), impossible in the Baire space X; hence U=∅ and A is meagre.

Consequences. For any unrooted graph property P for which A_P={G∈Y: G has P} has the Baire property (e.g., Borel/analytic), S_P=π^{-1}(A_P) is nowhere dense/meagre in X iff A_P is nowhere dense/meagre in Y. This establishes Conjecture 1 in full generality for the properties treated in the extended abstract (and many others).

Section metrics and bounded re‑rooting

Let s be a section Y→X (chooses a root in each unrooted graph). Define a metric d_s on Y by d_s(G,H)=d_\bullet((G,s(G)),(H,s(H))).

Proposition 5 (bounded re‑rooting equivalence). If sections s,t satisfy dist_G(s(G),t(G))≤R_0 for all G, then id:(Y,d_s)→(Y,d_t) is a homeomorphism. In particular, meagre/nowhere‑dense status is root‑invariant across such section metrics.
Proof. If B_r(G,s(G))≅B_r(H,s(H)), then B_{r−R_0}(G,t(G))≅B_{r−R_0}(H,t(H)) for r≥R_0, giving continuity in both directions.

A corrected odd‑D regular bridge‑forcing gadget

We give an explicit and verifiable refinement of the parity gadget needed in the D‑regular, odd D case, usable in any argument that relies on rooted cylinders.

Definition (port gadget Q_D). For odd D≥3, let Q_D be K_{D+1} with one missing edge ab. Then all vertices except a,b have degree D; vertices a,b have degree D−1.

Lemma 6 (pairwise deficit reduction). Let F be a rooted r‑ball in a D‑regular graph (odd D), and let L be its boundary. Write f(v)=D−deg_F(v) for v∈L and δ(F)=Σ_{v∈L} f(v). If v≠w are boundary vertices with f(v),f(w)≥1, then by adding a disjoint copy of Q_D and identifying a with v, b with w (and keeping all Q_D internal edges), we obtain a refined ball F′ whose interior degrees remain ≤D, whose newly added vertices are all of degree D inside F′, and for which δ(F′)=δ(F)−2.
Proof. After identification, a and b gain one extra incident edge (to v,w respectively), raising their degrees to D; all other vertices of Q_D already have degree D. Internal degrees of v and w in F increase by one, so f(v),f(w) each drop by one; no new boundary vertices are created; hence δ drops by 2.

Proposition 7 (forcing δ=1). Starting from any rooted r‑ball F in a D‑regular graph with odd D, there exists r′ and a refinement F′ such that δ(F′)=1. Moreover, F′ is realizable as a rooted r′‑ball in \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}.
Proof. Repeatedly apply Lemma 6, pairing boundary vertices with positive deficits until no such pair remains. Each step preserves “internal degrees ≤D” and creates no new boundary vertices. Since δ(F)≡|V(F)|·D−2|E(F)|≡|V(F)| (mod 2) and D is odd, δ(F) is odd; hence the minimal achievable value under −2 decrements is 1. The result is a finite extension F′ with δ(F′)=1.

Corollary 8 (bridge forcing in any D‑regular extension). Let F′ be as in Proposition 7 and let S be its vertex set. In any D‑regular extension G of F′, the number of edges between S and V(G)\S equals δ(F′)=1; hence that unique edge is a 1‑way infinite bridge.
Proof. In any D‑regular extension, the number of cross edges is Σ_{v∈S}(D−deg_S(v))=δ(F′)=1. Removing that edge disconnects the finite set S from the infinite complement.

Therefore, for every rooted cylinder \mathbf{G}_\bullet^F there exists a subcylinder \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F′} contained in its closure such that every extension has a (1‑way infinite) bridge. This corrects and completes the gadget argument in odd D.

A robust “no‑go” region for Conjecture 2

Definition (cylinder‑based topology). A topology τ on X is cylinder‑based if for every x∈X and every τ‑open set U∋x there exists an r‑ball F with x∈\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F⊆U.

Theorem 9 (bridgeless remains nowhere dense in any cylinder‑based topology). In any τ as above (on ≤D or =D with odd D), the set of bridgeless rooted graphs is nowhere dense.
Proof. Given a nonempty τ‑open U, pick x∈U and a rooted cylinder \mathbf{G}_\bullet^F with x∈\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F⊆U. By the degree‑bounded argument (≤D) or by Proposition 7 (odd D), there exists F′⪰F such that every extension of F′ contains a bridge. Then \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F′} is τ‑open, nonempty, \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F′}⊆U, and \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F′} contains no bridgeless graph.

Section metrics d_s are cylinder‑based (cylinders relative to s(G) form a neighborhood base), hence bridgeless remains nowhere dense for all section metrics.

A coarser “tail” topology cannot make bridgeless comeagre

Define the tail subbasis at (G,ρ) by the sets U_R(G,ρ) of all (H,σ) for which there is a root‑preserving isomorphism between G\B_R(G,ρ) and H\B_R(H,σ) mapping the boundary sphere to the boundary sphere. This topology is strictly coarser than the BS topology and is natural for studying “end behavior.”

Observation 10 (bridging has nonempty interior in the tail topology). If (G,ρ) has a bridge e outside B_R(G,ρ), then every (H,σ)∈U_R(G,ρ) has a corresponding bridge in H (the isomorphism fixes the outside where the bridge lies). Thus the set “has a bridge” contains U_R(G,ρ) and hence has nonempty interior.

Conclusion. If the tail space is Baire (open problem to settle rigorously), the set of bridgeless graphs cannot be comeagre there. Hence tail‑type metrics cannot make bridgeless typical.

Examples and checks

- Root‑invariance: Theorems 3 and Corollary 4 immediately yield that all results Theorems 14–17 are independent of the root choice (and of section metrics boundedly re‑rooting equivalent).
- Odd‑D gadget sanity check: For D=3, Q_3=K_4−e. Each application reduces δ by 2 without creating new boundary deficits. Iterating yields δ=1 and forces exactly one cross edge in any 3‑regular extension.

Obstacles

- For meagreness without assuming the Baire property of A⊆Y, the implication π^{-1}(A) meagre ⇒ A meagre can fail in general for quotient maps. Restricting to Baire‑property sets is both natural and sufficient here.
- Alternative metrics: To actually produce a metric changing typicality (beyond the no‑go region), one needs a topology where basic neighborhoods need not contain any rooted cylinder and which is provably Baire; constructing such a topology with a clean combinatorial neighborhood description remains open.

Next steps

- Move Lemmas 1–2, Theorem 3, and Corollary 4 into proofs.md with full details and references (quotient maps, Baire spaces, open images of Baire spaces).
- Record Proposition 7 and Corollary 8 (odd‑D gadget) in proofs.md; this also patches the FLP/even‑odd parity construction noted in the feedback.
- Formalize the tail topology and settle its Baire status; if Baire, Observation 10 implies bridgeless is not comeagre there.
- Explore a “pattern‑inclusion” ultrametric on Y based on equality of sets of rooted r‑balls S_r(G); verify ultrametricity on the quotient and analyze the category of bridge‑related sets. Prove or refute that both “has a bridge” and “bridgeless” have empty interior in this topology.
