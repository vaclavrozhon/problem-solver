  "summary_md": "Last round: Conjecture 1 was resolved. Using the forgetful map \u03c0:X\u2192Y (continuous, open, surjective) we proved that nowhere\u2011denseness of an unrooted property is equivalent to nowhere\u2011denseness of its rooted lift; meagreness equivalence holds for sets with the Baire property (hence for natural Borel/analytic properties). For Conjecture 2 we proved a strong no\u2011go: any metric whose basic opens are the rooted cylinders induces the Benjamini\u2013Schramm topology, so typicality is preserved under such metrics. We proposed a coarser, re\u2011rooting\u2011insensitive topology (bidirectional r\u2011appearance, \u201cd_any\u201d) in which 1\u2011way infinite\u2011bridge graphs are dense, but the Baire/Polish status of that topology and the category of bridgeless vs bridged sets there remain open. An odd\u2011D parity gadget forcing a unique outgoing edge (hence a 1\u2011way bridge in every D\u2011regular completion) was constructed; formalization and write\u2011up remain.",
