Using the forgetful map \u03c0:X\u2192Y (continuous, open, surjective) we proved that nowhere\u2011denseness of an unrooted property is equivalent to nowhere\u2011denseness of its rooted lift; meagreness equivalence holds for sets with the Baire property (hence for natural Borel/analytic properties). For Conjecture 2 we proved a strong no\u2011go: any metric whose basic opens are the rooted cylinders induces the Benjamini\u2013Schramm topology, so typicality is preserved under such metrics. We proposed a coarser, re\u2011rooting\u2011insensitive topology (bidirectional r\u2011appearance, \u201cd_any\u201d) in which 1\u2011way infinite\u2011bridge graphs are dense, but the Baire/Polish status of that topology and the category of bridgeless vs bridged sets there remain open. An odd\u2011D parity gadget forcing a unique outgoing edge (hence a 1\u2011way bridge in every D\u2011regular completion) was constructed; formalization and write\u2011up remain.\",\"highlights\":[\"Forgetful map \u03c0:X\u2192Y is continuous, open and surjective \u2192 nowhere\u2011denseness in unrooted space \u21d4 nowhere\u2011denseness in rooted space.\",\"Meagreness transfers for sets with the Baire property (in particular Borel/analytic sets) \u2192 root\u2011invariance for natural properties.\",\"Any topology with rooted cylinders as a base equals the Benjamini\u2013Schramm topology, so cylinder\u2011based metric changes cannot alter typicality (no\u2011go).\",\"Constructed an odd\u2011D regular parity gadget yielding S(F')=1, forcing a unique edge out of a finite ball and thus a 1\u2011way infinite bridge in every D\u2011regular completion.\",\"Introduced a coarser re\u2011rooting\u2011insensitive topology (d_any) where 1\u2011way infinite\u2011bridge graphs are dense; Baire/typicality there is unresolved.\"],\"next_questions\":[\"Formalize the d_any topology precisely, prove or disprove it is a Baire (or Polish) space, and determine the category (meagre/comeagre) of bridgeless vs bridged sets there.\",\"Finalize and write up the \u03c0\u2011based proofs and the odd\u2011D regular parity gadget (proofs.md), addressing remaining formal details and embedding constructions.\",\"Verify and document preservation of typicality for section/choice metrics (bounded re\u2011rooting equivalence) and record any remaining corner cases.\" ]}",
