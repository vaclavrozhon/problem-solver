Last round: Conjecture 1 was resolved. Using the forgetful map π:X→Y (continuous, open, surjective) we proved that nowhere‑denseness of an unrooted property is equivalent to nowhere‑denseness of its rooted lift; meagreness equivalence holds for sets with the Baire property (hence for natural Borel/analytic properties). For Conjecture 2 we proved a strong no‑go: any metric whose basic opens are the rooted cylinders induces the Benjamini–Schramm topology, so typicality is preserved under such metrics. We proposed a coarser, re‑rooting‑insensitive topology (bidirectional r‑appearance, “d_any”) in which 1‑way infinite‑bridge graphs are dense, but the Baire/Polish status of that topology and the category of bridgeless vs bridged sets there remain open. An odd‑D parity gadget forcing a unique outgoing edge (hence a 1‑way bridge in every D‑regular completion) was constructed; formalization and write‑up remain.
