{"summary_md":"Last round: Conjecture 1 was resolved. Using the forgetful map π:X→Y (continuous, open, surjective) we proved that nowhere‑denseness of an unrooted property is equivalent to nowhere‑denseness of its rooted lift; meagreness equivalence holds for sets with the Baire property (hence for natural Borel/analytic properties). For Conjecture 2 we proved a strong no‑go: any metric whose basic opens are the rooted cylinders induces the Benjamini–Schramm topology, so typicality is preserved under such metrics. We proposed a coarser, re‑rooting‑insensitive topology (bidirectional r‑appearance, “d_any”) in which 1‑way infinite‑bridge graphs are dense, but the Baire/Polish status of that topology and the category of bridgeless vs bridged sets there remain open. An odd‑D parity gadget forcing a unique outgoing edge (hence a 1‑way bridge in every D‑regular completion) was constructed; formalization and write‑up remain.","highlights":["Forgetful map π:X→Y is continuous, open and surjective → nowhere‑denseness in unrooted space ⇔ nowhere‑denseness in rooted space.","Meagreness transfers for sets with the Baire property (in particular Borel/analytic sets) → root‑invariance for natural properties.","Any topology with rooted cylinders as a base equals the Benjamini–Schramm topology, so cylinder‑based metric changes cannot alter typicality (no‑go).","Constructed an odd‑D regular parity gadget yielding S(F')=1, forcing a unique edge out of a finite ball and thus a 1‑way infinite bridge in every D‑regular completion.","Introduced a coarser re‑rooting‑insensitive topology (d_any) where 1‑way infinite‑bridge graphs are dense; Baire/typicality there is unresolved."],"next_questions":["Formalize the d_any topology precisely, prove or disprove it is a Baire (or Polish) space, and determine the category (meagre/comeagre) of bridgeless vs bridged sets there.","Finalize and write up the π‑based proofs and the odd‑D regular parity gadget (proofs.md), addressing remaining formal details and embedding constructions.","Verify and document preservation of typicality for section/choice metrics (bounded re‑rooting equivalence) and record any remaining corner cases." ]}
