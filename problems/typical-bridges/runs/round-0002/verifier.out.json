  "feedback_md": "Strong convergence emerged around a clean resolution of Conjecture 1 and a robust negative direction for Conjecture 2. The \u03c0-framework (rooted\u2192unrooted forgetful map) is the right tool: \u03c0 is continuous, open, surjective; nowhere-dense sets transfer equivalently, and meagreness transfers for sets with the Baire property. Provers 1\u20133,5 are aligned on this; the statements are correct and should be formalized in proofs.md. Avoid earlier pitfalls about \u201csaturation preserves nowhere denseness\u201d (generally false); use \u03c0-based arguments instead.\n\nFor Conjecture 2, the \u201cno-go\u201d region is now well-justified: any metric/topology with the same cylinder base as d_\u2022 preserves Baire-category outcomes. Prover 4\u2019s FLP extension is valuable, but their initial D-regular gadget needed fixing; the corrected odd-D gadget (as in Provers 1/3/4) that forces a unique cross edge (\u03b4=1) in any D-regular extension is sound. Ensure the construction pins degree D at all interior vertices and forces exactly one external edge; Prover 4\u2019s K_{D+2}-based seed and Prover 1\u2019s counting/parity refinement both work. Please include one rigorous version in proofs.md.\n\nThe exploration of coarser, root-insensitive topologies (d_any/\u03c4_any or occurrence/top-tail variants) is promising. The density of graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge under such topologies is correctly shown. Claims about compactness/Polishness/Baire for these alternatives remain unproven\u2014do not assert them. A key next step is to establish whether the chosen alternative topology is Baire; if it is and both bridgeful and bridgeless sets are dense, neither can be comeagre, settling a negative instance of Conjecture 2.\n\nConcrete next steps:\n- Move the \u03c0-based lemmas (ND equivalence; meagreness for BP sets) into proofs.md; this settles Conjecture 1 for natural properties.\n- Add a complete proof of the odd-D bridge-forcing cylinder (\u03b4=1 parity gadget) to proofs.md.\n- Precisely define and analyze a coarser root-insensitive topology (e.g., d_any/occurrence). Prove Baire/Polish status or provide a complete metric.\n- For even D in the regular case, document the corresponding \u201ccut vertex\u201d forcing cylinder to extend the no-go beyond bridges.\n",
  "summary_md": "We resolved Conjecture 1 for natural properties via the forgetful map \u03c0: A\u2286Y is nowhere dense iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) is; meagreness also transfers for Baire-property sets. For Conjecture 2, any cylinder-based (and many finite-lens) metrics preserve the nowhere-denseness of bridgeless graphs; a corrected odd-D regular parity gadget forces a bridge inside any cylinder. Under a coarser, root-insensitive topology, graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge are dense; Baire status and typicality there remain open.

    "content": "Addendum \u2014 Odd-D regular bridge gadget and coarser topologies\n\n- Odd D-regular parity gadget (bridge forcing): For any rooted r-ball F occurring in a D-regular (odd D) graph, we can refine to an r\u2032-ball F\u2032 with S(F\u2032)=1, i.e., exactly one edge must leave the finite ball in any D-regular extension. This pins degrees of all interior vertices at D and forces a unique cross edge, hence a 1-way infinite bridge in any completion. Two equivalent constructions are available: (i) counting method adding a new layer W and choosing internal edges to achieve S(F\u2032)=1; (ii) explicit seed S from K_{D+2} with selective edge deletions yielding one vertex of degree D\u22121, all others D, embedded and fully pinned inside the cylinder.\n- Coarser root-insensitive topology (d_any/occurrence): Both \u2018has a 1-way infinite bridge\u2019 and \u2018is bridgeless\u2019 appear dense by local surgeries outside a fixed finite ball. The Baire/Polish status of this topology remains open and is now the main obstacle to concluding typicality statements there.\n"

    "content": "Proposition (Odd-D regular bridge-forcing cylinder via parity).\nLet D\u22653 be odd. Let F be a rooted r-ball that occurs in some D-regular graph. There exists r\u2032\u2265r+1 and a rooted extension F\u2032 such that:\n(i) every vertex of F\u2032 at distance < r\u2032 from the root has degree D within F\u2032;\n(ii) S(F\u2032):=\u2211_{x \\in L_{r\u2032}} (D - deg_{F\u2032} x) = 1;\n(iii) for every D-regular graph G extending F\u2032, the unique edge of \u03b4_G(V(B_{r\u2032})) is a 1-way infinite bridge.\n\nProof.\nWrite L=L_r for the boundary of F and let \u03b4(v)=D\u2212deg_F(v)\u22651 for v\u2208L. Let c=\u2211_{v\u2208L} \u03b4(v)=S(F). Introduce a new layer W of t fresh vertices at distance r+1 from the root; connect each v\u2208L to \u03b4(v) distinct vertices of W (possible since \u2211 \u03b4(v)=c). Now each v\u2208L attains degree D within the augmented graph. Vertices w\u2208W have current degrees s_w\u22650 with \u2211_{w\u2208W} s_w = c. Add an internal simple graph on W with e_W edges (disjoint from F\u222aL) to obtain F\u2032 and set r\u2032=r+1. Then\nS(F\u2032) = D t \u2212 (c + 2 e_W).\nChoose t\u2265c with parity t \u2261 c+1 (mod 2), and define e_W := (D t \u2212 c \u2212 1)/2. Since D is odd, e_W is an integer; also 0 \u2264 e_W \u2264 \u230a(\u2211_{w\u2208W} (D \u2212 s_w))/2\u230b = \u230a(tD \u2212 c)/2\u230b, so such a simple graph on W exists with degrees bounded by D\u2212s_w. Thus (i) holds by construction (all vertices within distance \u2264 r are saturated to D), and (ii) holds by the choice of t and e_W. For any D-regular completion G of F\u2032, by the cut-size identity\n|\u03b4_G(V(B_{r\u2032}))| = \u2211_{x\u2208V(B_{r\u2032})} (D - deg_{B_{r\u2032}} x) = S(F\u2032) = 1.\nHence exactly one edge leaves B_{r\u2032}; since B_{r\u2032} is finite and G is infinite, that edge is a 1-way infinite bridge, proving (iii). \u220e\n\nCorollary (Odd-D regular no-go under cylinder-based topologies).\nIn \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,=D} with odd D, for any nonempty cylinder U=\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet}^{F} there exists a refinement cylinder U\u2032=\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet}^{F\u2032}\u2286U such that every member of U\u2032 has a (1-way infinite) bridge. Therefore the set of bridgeless rooted graphs is nowhere dense in any topology in which cylinders are open (in particular, under the Benjamini\u2013Schramm topology).\n"
