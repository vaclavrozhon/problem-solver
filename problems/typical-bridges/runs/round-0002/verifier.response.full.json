Let c=\u2211_{v\u2208L} \u03b4(v)=S(F). Introduce a new layer W of t fresh vertices at distance r+1 from the root; connect each v\u2208L to \u03b4(v) distinct vertices of W (possible since \u2211 \u03b4(v)=c). Now each v\u2208L attains degree D within the augmented graph. Vertices w\u2208W have current degrees s_w\u22650 with \u2211_{w\u2208W} s_w = c. Add an internal simple graph on W with e_W edges (disjoint from F\u222aL) to obtain F\u2032 and set r\u2032=r+1. Then\\nS(F\u2032) = D t \u2212 (c + 2 e_W).\\nChoose t\u2265c with parity t \u2261 c+1 (mod 2), and define e_W := (D t \u2212 c \u2212 1)/2. Since D is odd, e_W is an integer; also 0 \u2264 e_W \u2264 \u230a(\u2211_{w\u2208W} (D \u2212 s_w))/2\u230b = \u230a(tD \u2212 c)/2\u230b, so such a simple graph on W exists with degrees bounded by D\u2212s_w. Thus (i) holds by construction (all vertices within distance \u2264 r are saturated to D), and (ii) holds by the choice of t and e_W. For any D-regular completion G of F\u2032, by the cut-size identity\\n|\u03b4_G(V(B_{r\u2032}))| = \u2211_{x\u2208V(B_{r\u2032})} (D - deg_{B_{r\u2032}} x) = S(F\u2032) = 1.\\nHence exactly one edge leaves B_{r\u2032}; since B_{r\u2032} is finite and G is infinite, that edge is a 1-way infinite bridge, proving (iii). \u220e\\n\\nCorollary (Odd-D regular no-go under cylinder-based topologies).\\nIn \\\\mathbf{G}_{\\\\bullet,=D} with odd D, for any nonempty cylinder U=\\\\mathbf{G}_{\\\\bullet}^{F} there exists a refinement cylinder U\u2032=\\\\mathbf{G}_{\\\\bullet}^{F\u2032}\u2286U such that every member of U\u2032 has a (1-way infinite) bridge.
