We resolved Conjecture 1 for natural properties via the forgetful map π: A⊆Y is nowhere dense iff π^{-1}(A) is; meagreness also transfers for Baire-property sets. For Conjecture 2, any cylinder-based (and many finite-lens) metrics preserve the nowhere-denseness of bridgeless graphs; a corrected odd-D regular parity gadget forces a bridge inside any cylinder. Under a coarser, root-insensitive topology, graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge are dense; Baire status and typicality there remain open. Next: formalize π-based proofs and the odd-D gadget, and analyze Baire properties of the candidate coarser topology.
