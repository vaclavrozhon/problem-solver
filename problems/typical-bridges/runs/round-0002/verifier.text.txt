{"feedback_md":"Strong convergence emerged around a clean resolution of Conjecture 1 and a robust negative direction for Conjecture 2. The π-framework (rooted→unrooted forgetful map) is the right tool: π is continuous, open, surjective; nowhere-dense sets transfer equivalently, and meagreness transfers for sets with the Baire property. Provers 1–3,5 are aligned on this; the statements are correct and should be formalized in proofs.md. Avoid earlier pitfalls about “saturation preserves nowhere denseness” (generally false); use π-based arguments instead.\n\nFor Conjecture 2, the “no-go” region is now well-justified: any metric/topology with the same cylinder base as d_• preserves Baire-category outcomes. Prover 4’s FLP extension is valuable, but their initial D-regular gadget needed fixing; the corrected odd-D gadget (as in Provers 1/3/4) that forces a unique cross edge (δ=1) in any D-regular extension is sound. Ensure the construction pins degree D at all interior vertices and forces exactly one external edge; Prover 4’s K_{D+2}-based seed and Prover 1’s counting/parity refinement both work. Please include one rigorous version in proofs.md.\n\nThe exploration of coarser, root-insensitive topologies (d_any/τ_any or occurrence/top-tail variants) is promising. The density of graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge under such topologies is correctly shown. Claims about compactness/Polishness/Baire for these alternatives remain unproven—do not assert them. A key next step is to establish whether the chosen alternative topology is Baire; if it is and both bridgeful and bridgeless sets are dense, neither can be comeagre, settling a negative instance of Conjecture 2.\n\nConcrete next steps:\n- Move the π-based lemmas (ND equivalence; meagreness for BP sets) into proofs.md; this settles Conjecture 1 for natural properties.\n- Add a complete proof of the odd-D bridge-forcing cylinder (δ=1 parity gadget) to proofs.md.\n- Precisely define and analyze a coarser root-insensitive topology (e.g., d_any/occurrence).

This pins degrees of all interior vertices at D and forces a unique cross edge, hence a 1-way infinite bridge in any completion. Two equivalent constructions are available: (i) counting method adding a new layer W and choosing internal edges to achieve S(F′)=1; (ii) explicit seed S from K_{D+2} with selective edge deletions yielding one vertex of degree D−1, all others D, embedded and fully pinned inside the cylinder.\n- Coarser root-insensitive topology (d_any/occurrence): Both ‘has a 1-way infinite bridge’ and ‘is bridgeless’ appear dense by local surgeries outside a fixed finite ball. The Baire/Polish status of this topology remains open and is now the main obstacle to concluding typicality statements there.\n"},"proofs_update":{"action":"append","content":"Proposition (Odd-D regular bridge-forcing cylinder via parity).\nLet D≥3 be odd. Let F be a rooted r-ball that occurs in some D-regular graph. There exists r′≥r+1 and a rooted extension F′ such that:\n(i) every vertex of F′ at distance < r′ from the root has degree D within F′;\n(ii) S(F′):=∑_{x \\in L_{r′}} (D - deg_{F′} x) = 1;\n(iii) for every D-regular graph G extending F′, the unique edge of δ_G(V(B_{r′})) is a 1-way infinite bridge.\n\nProof.\nWrite L=L_r for the boundary of F and let δ(v)=D−deg_F(v)≥1 for v∈L. Let c=∑_{v∈L} δ(v)=S(F). Introduce a new layer W of t fresh vertices at distance r+1 from the root; connect each v∈L to δ(v) distinct vertices of W (possible since ∑ δ(v)=c). Now each v∈L attains degree D within the augmented graph. Vertices w∈W have current degrees s_w≥0 with ∑_{w∈W} s_w = c. Add an internal simple graph on W with e_W edges (disjoint from F∪L) to obtain F′ and set r′=r+1. Then\nS(F′) = D t − (c + 2 e_W).\nChoose t≥c with parity t ≡ c+1 (mod 2), and define e_W := (D t − c − 1)/2. Since D is odd, e_W is an integer; also 0 ≤ e_W ≤ ⌊(∑_{w∈W} (D − s_w))/2⌋ = ⌊(tD − c)/2⌋, so such a simple graph on W exists with degrees bounded by D−s_w. Thus (i) holds by construction (all vertices within distance ≤ r are saturated to D), and (ii) holds by the choice of t and e_W. For any D-regular completion G of F′, by the cut-size identity\n|δ_G(V(B_{r′}))| = ∑_{x∈V(B_{r′})} (D - deg_{B_{r′}} x) = S(F′) = 1.\nHence exactly one edge leaves B_{r′}; since B_{r′} is finite and G is infinite, that edge is a 1-way infinite bridge, proving (iii). ∎\n\nCorollary (Odd-D regular no-go under cylinder-based topologies).\nIn \\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet,=D} with odd D, for any nonempty cylinder U=\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet}^{F} there exists a refinement cylinder U′=\\mathbf{G}_{\\bullet}^{F′}⊆U such that every member of U′ has a (1-way infinite) bridge. Therefore the set of bridgeless rooted graphs is nowhere dense in any topology in which cylinders are open (in particular, under the Benjamini–Schramm topology).\n"},"output_update":null}
