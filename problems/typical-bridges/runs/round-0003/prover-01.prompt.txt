# Open Problem: Resolve the Final Two Conjectures on Typical Properties of Countable Graphs

This note poses two conjectures extracted from the extended abstract **“Typical properties of countable graphs: flows and bridges (extended abstract)”** by Robert Šámal and Hadi Zamani (EUROCOMB’25). We first state the setting precisely and then formulate the conjectures. The authors’ extended abstract (lightly re‑typeset) follows afterward for context.

---

## Setting

- Fix an integer \(D \ge 2\).
- Let \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) be the space of **countably infinite, connected, rooted graphs** \((G,\rho)\).
- For \((G,\rho) \in \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) and \(r \in \mathbb{N}\), let \(B_r(G,\rho)\) denote the rooted (closed) ball of radius \(r\) about \(\rho\).
- Equip \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) with the **local (Benjamini–Schramm) metric** \(d_\bullet\) given by
  \[
  d_\bullet\big((G,\rho),(H,\sigma)\big)=2^{-R},
  \qquad
  R=\sup\{r\in\mathbb{N} : B_r(G,\rho)\cong B_r(H,\sigma)\}.
  \]
  (Equivalently, \(d_\bullet((G,\rho),(H,\sigma))<2^{-r}\) iff \(B_r(G,\rho)\cong B_r(H,\sigma)\).)
- Degree‑constrained subspaces:
  - \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\): all rooted graphs with \(\Delta(G)\le D\).
  - \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,= D}\): all rooted graphs with \(\Delta(G)= D\).
  We write \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for either of these when the distinction is unimportant.
- A subset \(S\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) is **nowhere dense** if the interior of \(\overline{S}\) is empty. A set is **meagre** (first category) if it is a countable union of nowhere dense sets; its complement is **comeagre**. A property is called **typical** if the corresponding set is comeagre.
- An edge \(e\) of an (unrooted) graph \(G\) is a **bridge** if \(G-e\) has more connected components than \(G\). A bridge is **2‑way infinite** if both components are infinite and **1‑way infinite** otherwise.

## Conjectures

### Conjecture 1 — Root‑invariance of smallness
Let \(P\) be any property of unrooted graphs and put
\[
S_P=\{(G,\rho)\in \mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}: G\text{ has }P\}.
\]
Whether \(S_P\) is **nowhere dense** (respectively, **meagre**) in \((\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D},d_\bullet)\) **does not depend on the choice of the root** \(\rho\).

### Conjecture 2 — Metric sensitivity of typicality
There exists a **natural alternative metric** on the same underlying set \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for which the collection of **typical properties** differs from those under \(d_\bullet\). In particular, determine whether there is a reasonable metric in which **bridgeless graphs are typical**, or prove that no such metric can change their typicality.

### Typical properties of countable graphs: flows and bridges  
*(Extended abstract)*  

**Robert Šámal**\* · **Hadi Zamani**\*

#### Abstract
We have two aims. **First**, we study nowhere‑zero flows in countably infinite graphs, observing the different roles of two types of bridges. **Second**, we study how typical graphs with these types of bridges are. As there is no natural probability measure to use, we turn to an analytic approach: we study which sets are nowhere dense and which are meagre.

In finite graphs, bridges play a crucial role—it is easy to see that every flow assigns value \(0\) to every bridge. It is also known that graphs with a bridge are not typical: both dense random graphs and random regular graphs are bridgeless w.h.p. [3, 1]. We ask how this transfers to countable graphs. In Section 1 we explain differences between bridges and flows and, via compactness, we prove a version of Seymour’s 6‑flow theorem for countable graphs.

In Section 2 we explore nowhere‑dense and meagre sets. This is called for because the usual probabilistic models collapse: extending Erdős–Rényi to countably infinite graphs yields the Rado graph a.s., so we are effectively studying a single graph up to isomorphism. Attempting random regular graphs via the configuration model [1] would require a uniform distribution on perfect matchings of a countable set (e.g., neighbors of the first vertex), which does not exist. Consequently, we turn to Baire category: meagre/co‑meagre sets (also “first/second category”).

### 1. Nowhere‑zero flows for infinite graphs

**Definition 1 (weak flow).**  
Given an orientation \(D\) of a graph \(G\) and an abelian group \(A\), a **weak \(A\)‑flow** is a function \(\varphi:E(G)\to A\) such that **Kirchhoff’s law for each vertex cut** holds:
\[
\forall v\in V(G):\quad \sum_{e\in \delta^-(v)}\varphi(e)=\sum_{e\in \delta^+(v)}\varphi(e).
\]

**Definition 2 (strong flow).**  
Given \(D,G,A\) as above, a **strong \(A\)‑flow** is a function \(\varphi:E(G)\to A\) such that **Kirchhoff’s law for each cut** holds:
\[
\forall S\subseteq V(G):\quad \sum_{e\in \delta^+(S)}\varphi(e)=\sum_{e\in \delta^-(S)}\varphi(e).
\]

In either case, \(\varphi\) is a **nowhere‑zero** weak/strong \(A\)‑flow if \(\varphi^{-1}(0)=\varnothing\).

**Definition 3 (bridge).**  
An edge \(e\) of \(G\) is a **bridge** if deleting \(e\) increases the number of connected components. A bridge is **2‑way infinite** if both resulting components are infinite, and **1‑way infinite** otherwise.

Every strong flow is a weak flow. While the two notions are equivalent on finite graphs, they diverge on infinite graphs: e.g., on a two‑way infinite path, a nowhere‑zero weak \(A\)‑flow exists but a strong one does not. In [6] the authors construct a 3‑connected graph with two ends that admits a nowhere‑zero weak \(A\)‑flow but no nowhere‑zero strong \(A\)‑flow. Nearly all finite flow theorems extend to infinite **strong** \(A\)‑flows via topological compactness; here we use **logical** compactness to obtain:

**Theorem 4.**  
*A countably infinite, locally finite graph without a 1‑way infinite bridge has a nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow.*

---

### 2. Metric space of rooted connected graphs

Since no good probability measure exists for countable graphs, we study typicality via a metric topology and Baire category.

**Definition 5 (ε‑neighborhood).**  
For a metric space \((X,d)\) and \(x\in X\), the ε‑neighborhood is \(U_\varepsilon(x)=\{y\in X:\ d(x,y)<\varepsilon\}\). The closed neighborhood \(\overline{U}_\varepsilon(x)\) uses \(d(x,y)\le \varepsilon\).

**Definition 6 (open set).**  
A set \(U\subseteq X\) is open if \(\forall x\in U\ \exists \varepsilon>0:\ U_\varepsilon(x)\subseteq U\).

We now fix the graph space and metric.

**Definition 9 (space of rooted graphs).**  
Let \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet\) be the set of all connected rooted graphs (up to root‑preserving isomorphism). For \(D>2\), let \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) be those with all degrees \(\le D\), and \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) those with all degrees \(=D\).

**Definition 10 (r‑ball).**  
For \((G,v)\), the rooted r‑ball is
\[
B_r(G,v)=(\,G[\{y\in V(G): d(v,y)\le r\}],\,v\,).
\]

**Definition 11 (metric \(d_\bullet\)).**  
For \((G_1,v_1),(G_2,v_2)\in\mathbf{G}_\bullet\),
\[
d_\bullet\big((G_1,v_1),(G_2,v_2)\big)=\inf\{2^{-r} : B_r(G_1,v_1)\cong B_r(G_2,v_2)\}.
\]
This is a metric [5].

**Definition 12 (extensions of an r‑ball).**  
For an r‑ball \(F=B_r(G,v)\), define
\[
\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F=\{(G',v')\in \mathbf{G}_\bullet : B_r(G',v')\cong F\}.
\]

**Lemma 13 (basic facts in \((\mathbf{G}_\bullet,d_\bullet)\)).**  
- For each \((G,x)\), \(r\in\mathbb{N}\), and \(0<\varepsilon<1\):
  \[
  U_{2^{-r}+\varepsilon}((G,x))=U_{2^{-r}}((G,x))=\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{B_r(G,x)}.
  \]
- \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^F\) is nonempty if \(F\) is an r‑ball in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) that contains a vertex of degree \< \(D\) at distance \(r\) from the root.
- A subset \(S\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet\) is nowhere dense iff
  \(\forall\) r‑balls \(F\ \exists\) r′‑ball \(F'\) with \(\mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F'}\subseteq \mathbf{G}_\bullet^{F}\setminus S\).
- For all \(D>2\), \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) is not meagre.

---

### Main results on typical properties

**Theorem 14.**  
*The set of bridgeless graphs is nowhere dense (i) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\) for all \(D>2\); and (ii) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) for all odd \(D>2\).*  
In D‑regular graphs with even \(D\), 1‑way infinite bridges cannot exist; instead we obtain:

**Theorem 15.**  
*The set of graphs without a cut vertex is nowhere dense in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

**Theorem 16.**  
*The set of graphs with a 2‑way infinite bridge is meagre (but not nowhere dense) in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

We also considered other (a)typical properties:

**Theorem 17.**  
*The set of graphs with edge‑chromatic number \(D\) is nowhere dense in \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) for all \(D>2\).*

### 3. Proof sketches

**Proof of Theorem 4 (sketch).**  
Let the vertices of \(G\) be \(v_1,v_2,\ldots\) and orient each edge \(\{v_i,v_j\}\) from the smaller to the larger index. For each radius \(r\), augment the r‑ball \(B_r(G,v_1)\) to a finite multigraph \(G_r\) by adding a sink vertex \(v_\infty\) and connecting boundary edges to \(v_\infty\). Introduce Boolean variables \(F_{e,1},\dots,F_{e,6}\) encoding which of six nonzero values an edge \(e\) receives, enforce exclusivity \(\bigvee_i F_{e,i}\) and \(\bigwedge_{j\ne i}\neg F_{e,j}\), and write linear parity constraints at each vertex (Kirchhoff’s law). Let \(F_{G_r}\) be the conjunction over vertices of \(G_r\); then every finite subset of the constraint family \(\{F_{G_r}\}_r\cup\{F_{e,i}\}_e\) is satisfiable (by [7]), hence by compactness [4] the whole set is satisfiable, yielding a nowhere‑zero weak 6‑flow on \(G\).

**Proof idea for Theorem 14.**  
Given an r‑ball \(F\), construct an r′‑ball \(F'\) such that every extension of \(F'\) contains a bridge. For \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,\le D}\), attach a leaf to a boundary vertex of degree \<\(D\). For \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,=D}\) handle regularity via parity gadgets: define \(S(F)=\sum_{v\in L_r}(D-\deg v)\) where \(L_r\) is the boundary; use \(K_{D+1}-e\) gadgets and tree‑like expansions to force parity \(S(F)=1\), then attach a new vertex to create a bridge. Hence the bridgeless set is nowhere dense.

**Proof idea for Theorem 15.**  
In even \(D\)‑regular graphs, use gadgets to force a cut vertex; in odd \(D\) or degree‑bounded spaces, this also follows from the previous construction.

**Proof idea for Theorem 16.**  
Being “there is a 2‑way infinite bridge at distance \(k\)” is nowhere dense; take a union over \(k\in\mathbb{N}\) to get a meagre (but not nowhere‑dense) set.

**Proof idea for Theorem 17.**  
For each \(D\), there exist \(D\)‑regular graphs with \(\chi'(G)=D+1\) (even \(D\): complete graphs or any odd‑order \(D\)‑regular graph; odd \(D\): by Tutte’s theorem). Removing an edge preserves \(\chi'=D+1\) by parity. Embed parity gadgets within r‑balls so that every extension has edge‑chromatic number \(D+1\), hence the set is nowhere dense.

---

### 4. Future work (the conjectures)

**Question 18.** *Is the fact that a property is nowhere dense or meagre independent of the root?*  
A change of root gives one type of change of metric; however, many metrics on the space of countable graphs are possible.

**Question 19.** *Is there another metric on \(\mathbf{G}_{\bullet,D}\) where typical properties are different?*  
For instance, is there a metric in which **bridgeless graphs are typical**?

We also aim to investigate additional (a)typical properties in the spirit of Theorem 17.

# Research Notes



Working log — Conjectures 1 and 2

1) Root-invariance (Conjecture 1)
- Spaces: X = G_{\bullet,D} (rooted local topology), Y = unrooted countable connected graphs with Δ≤D, endowed with the rootless local topology generated by sets U_F^Y = {G: ∃v with B_r(G,v) ≅ F}.
- Forgetful map π: X → Y, π(G,ρ)=G, is continuous, open, surjective.
- Consequences:
  • Nowhere denseness transfers: A⊆Y is nowhere dense ⇔ π^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X.
  • Meagreness transfers for sets with the Baire property (e.g., Borel/analytic): A meagre in Y ⇔ π^{-1}(A) meagre in X.
  • Hence for any natural property P of unrooted graphs (bridges, cut vertices, edge-chromatic constraints, etc.), the smallness/meagreness status of S_P in X is root-invariant.
- Alternative restatement (root-free ND test): For saturated S⊆X, S is nowhere dense ⇔ for every unrooted r-ball B there exists an unrooted r′-ball B′ with Cyl(B′) ⊂ Cyl(B) \ S, where Cyl(B)=⋃_{v∈V(B)} G_{\bullet}^{(B,v)}.
- Caution: Saturating a nowhere dense set need not remain nowhere dense (can become dense meagre). Use the π-map, not saturation, for meagreness arguments.

2) No-go regimes for Conjecture 2
- Any metric/topology whose basic opens are exactly the rooted cylinders G_{\bullet}^F yields the same topology as d_•; typicality (meagre/comeagre) is unchanged. This covers all “ball-local/cylinder-based” metrics and many FLP (finite-lens) variants where opens depend on finitely many finite neighborhoods.
- FLP extension: In ≤D spaces, one can force a leaf inside any FLP-open neighborhood (pin a radius-1 neighborhood of a new vertex z with deg(z)=1), hence the bridgeless set is nowhere dense. For =D odd, a parity/degree-pinned bridge gadget is needed (parity bookkeeping as in the abstract). The naive “connect two D-regular graphs by one edge” breaks regularity—must fix this.

3) Candidate coarser topology for Conjecture 2
- Re-rooting–insensitive closeness: x and y are r-close if each contains some rooted r-ball isomorphic to a rooted r-ball of the other. Define d_any heuristically by the largest r with this bidirectional r-appearance. Under this coarser, rootless-local proximity, graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge are dense: starting from any r-ball F, attach a pendant infinite ray outside F and complete the rest away from F. This shows that density behavior changes once re-rooting is allowed.
- Open tasks: (i) Make the induced topology precise and verify Baire property; (ii) Determine the category of ‘bridgeless’ and ‘has a 1-way infinite bridge’. If both are dense in a Baire space, neither is comeagre.

4) Section metrics on unrooted space
- For a section s selecting a root in each unrooted graph, define a local metric d_s via (G,H) ↦ d_•( (G,s(G)), (H,s(H)) ). If s,t differ by uniformly bounded root moves, the identity is a homeomorphism (bounded re-rooting equivalence). Local forcing arguments (as in Theorem 14) show ‘bridgeless’ remains nowhere dense for every section metric.

5) Action items
- Move π-based proofs (nowhere-dense equivalence; meagreness for Baire sets) into proofs.md.
- Repair the =D odd FLP construction by using a fully pinned D-regular bridge gadget (or reintroduce parity gadgets) and document the argument.
- Formalize the topology behind d_any (Polish/Baire?) and analyze the category of bridge-related properties therein.
- For ‘2-way infinite bridge’ across section metrics, fill in the ‘not nowhere dense’ part via explicit dense sets built by bi-infinite path gadgets.


Addendum — Odd-D regular bridge gadget and coarser topologies

- Odd D-regular parity gadget (bridge forcing): For any rooted r-ball F occurring in a D-regular (odd D) graph, we can refine to an r′-ball F′ with S(F′)=1, i.e., exactly one edge must leave the finite ball in any D-regular extension. This pins degrees of all interior vertices at D and forces a unique cross edge, hence a 1-way infinite bridge in any completion. Two equivalent constructions are available: (i) counting method adding a new layer W and choosing internal edges to achieve S(F′)=1; (ii) explicit seed S from K_{D+2} with selective edge deletions yielding one vertex of degree D−1, all others D, embedded and fully pinned inside the cylinder.
- Coarser root-insensitive topology (d_any/occurrence): Both ‘has a 1-way infinite bridge’ and ‘is bridgeless’ appear dense by local surgeries outside a fixed finite ball. The Baire/Polish status of this topology remains open and is now the main obstacle to concluding typicality statements there.



=== Current Output ===

# Main Results



Main interim results toward the conjectures

- Root-invariance (Conjecture 1):
  • Nowhere-dense part resolved. For any property P of unrooted graphs, S_P is nowhere dense in the rooted space iff the corresponding set T_P in the unrooted space is nowhere dense. This uses the forgetful map π (continuous, open, surjective) and yields a root-free cylinder refinement criterion for saturated sets.
  • Meagre part resolved for all properties with the Baire property (in particular, Borel/analytic P): S_P is meagre in the rooted space iff T_P is meagre in the unrooted space. Hence smallness is root-invariant for all natural properties considered (bridges, cut vertices, edge-colouring constraints, etc.).

- Metric sensitivity (Conjecture 2):
  • No-go: Any metric that induces the same cylinder (Benjamini–Schramm) topology preserves typicality; in particular, bridgeless graphs remain nowhere dense under all such metrics.
  • Coarser “rootless-local” proximity: For a natural re-rooting–insensitive closeness, graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge are dense, indicating genuinely different behavior once the topology is coarsened. The Baire status and typicality under such a topology remain open.



=== Round 1 Summary ===

Last round settled Conjecture 1: smallness is root‑invariant. Using the forgetful map π:X→Y (continuous, open, surjective) we proved that for any unrooted property P, S_P is nowhere dense in the rooted Benjamini–Schramm space iff its unrooted image is nowhere dense; meagreness is equivalent for sets with the Baire property (hence for natural Borel/analytic properties). For Conjecture 2 we proved a strong no‑go: any metric whose basic opens are the rooted cylinders induces the same topology as d_•, so typicality cannot change under such metrics. We also proposed a coarser re‑rooting–insensitive topology (bidirectional r‑appearance, “d_any”) in which 1‑way infinite‑bridge graphs are dense; the Baire/typicality status of bridgeless vs. bridged sets there remains open. Technical fixes remain (D‑regular parity gadget) and several formalizations are pending.


=== Round 2 Summary ===

Last round: Conjecture 1 was resolved. Using the forgetful map π:X→Y (continuous, open, surjective) we proved that nowhere‑denseness of an unrooted property is equivalent to nowhere‑denseness of its rooted lift; meagreness equivalence holds for sets with the Baire property (hence for natural Borel/analytic properties). For Conjecture 2 we proved a strong no‑go: any metric whose basic opens are the rooted cylinders induces the Benjamini–Schramm topology, so typicality is preserved under such metrics. We proposed a coarser, re‑rooting‑insensitive topology (bidirectional r‑appearance, “d_any”) in which 1‑way infinite‑bridge graphs are dense, but the Baire/Polish status of that topology and the category of bridgeless vs bridged sets there remain open. An odd‑D parity gadget forcing a unique outgoing edge (hence a 1‑way bridge in every D‑regular completion) was constructed; formalization and write‑up remain.


=== Previous Round Feedback ===

Strong convergence emerged around a clean resolution of Conjecture 1 and a robust negative direction for Conjecture 2. The π-framework (rooted→unrooted forgetful map) is the right tool: π is continuous, open, surjective; nowhere-dense sets transfer equivalently, and meagreness transfers for sets with the Baire property. Provers 1–3,5 are aligned on this; the statements are correct and should be formalized in proofs.md. Avoid earlier pitfalls about “saturation preserves nowhere denseness” (generally false); use π-based arguments instead.

For Conjecture 2, the “no-go” region is now well-justified: any metric/topology with the same cylinder base as d_• preserves Baire-category outcomes. Prover 4’s FLP extension is valuable, but their initial D-regular gadget needed fixing; the corrected odd-D gadget (as in Provers 1/3/4) that forces a unique cross edge (δ=1) in any D-regular extension is sound. Ensure the construction pins degree D at all interior vertices and forces exactly one external edge; Prover 4’s K_{D+2}-based seed and Prover 1’s counting/parity refinement both work. Please include one rigorous version in proofs.md.

The exploration of coarser, root-insensitive topologies (d_any/τ_any or occurrence/top-tail variants) is promising. The density of graphs with a 1-way infinite bridge under such topologies is correctly shown. Claims about compactness/Polishness/Baire for these alternatives remain unproven—do not assert them. A key next step is to establish whether the chosen alternative topology is Baire; if it is and both bridgeful and bridgeless sets are dense, neither can be comeagre, settling a negative instance of Conjecture 2.

Concrete next steps:
- Move the π-based lemmas (ND equivalence; meagreness for BP sets) into proofs.md; this settles Conjecture 1 for natural properties.
- Add a complete proof of the odd-D bridge-forcing cylinder (δ=1 parity gadget) to proofs.md.
- Precisely define and analyze a coarser root-insensitive topology (e.g., d_any/occurrence). Prove Baire/Polish status or provide a complete metric.
- For even D in the regular case, document the corresponding “cut vertex” forcing cylinder to extend the no-go beyond bridges.
