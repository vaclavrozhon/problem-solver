Add the \u201cmeagre but dense\u201d robustness for 2\u2011way infinite bridges (Theorem 16) in any such topology.\\n- Provide a fully explicit parity/counting gadget for odd D to force a unique external edge (hence a 1\u2011way infinite bridge in any D\u2011regular completion). This repairs earlier parity issues and pins that the argument is topology\u2011agnostic within ball\u2011local classes.\\n- Give an explicit even D cut\u2011vertex forcing gadget: a finite D\u2011bounded r\u2032\u2011ball F\u2032 in which all deficits are concentrated at a single vertex u with deg_{F\u2032}(u)=D\u22122 and all other vertices saturated to D. In any D\u2011regular extension, all external edges must be incident to u, making u a cut vertex.\\n- For a natural rootless, re\u2011rooting\u2011insensitive pseudometric d_any, prove new density lemmas: 2\u2011way infinite bridges are dense as well (in addition to previously shown 1\u2011way bridges and bridgeless graphs). This sharpens our picture of Conjecture 2 under genuinely different topologies.\\n\\nRigorous results and proofs\\n\\nA. Root\u2011invariance (Conjecture 1)\\n\\nLet X=\\\\mathbf{G}_{\\\\bullet,D} (rooted space with BS topology) and Y=\\\\mathbf{G}_{\\\\varnothing,D} (unrooted space with rootless\u2011local topology generated by U_F^Y={G: \u2203v with B_r(G,v)\u2245F} for rooted r\u2011balls F). Let \u03c0:X\u2192Y be \u03c0(G,\u03c1)=G.\\n\\nLemma A1 (\u03c0 continuous, open, surjective). For any rooted r\u2011ball F, \u03c0(\\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^F)=U_F^Y and \u03c0^{-1}(U_F^Y)=\\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^F. Hence \u03c0 is continuous, open, onto.\\n\\nLemma A2 (closure/interior commute with \u03c0^{-1}). For all A\u2286Y,\\ncl_X \u03c0^{-1}(A)=\u03c0^{-1}(cl_Y A) and int_X \u03c0^{-1}(A)=\u03c0^{-1}(int_Y A).\\nProof. Continuity gives cl_X \u03c0^{-1}(A)\u2286\u03c0^{-1}(cl_Y A). For the reverse, if x\u2208\u03c0^{-1}(cl_Y A) and U\u2282X is open with x\u2208U, then \u03c0(U) is open (\u03c0 open), \u03c0(x)\u2208cl_Y A \u21d2 \u03c0(U)\u2229A\u2260\u2205 \u21d2 U\u2229\u03c0^{-1}(A)\u2260\u2205. Interior identity follows by complementing and reapplying closure identity.\\n\\nProposition A3 (nowhere\u2011dense equivalence). For any A\u2286Y, A is nowhere dense in Y iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) is nowhere dense in X.\\nProof. Nowhere dense \u21d4 int cl = \u2205. Using Lemma A2, int_X cl_X \u03c0^{-1}(A) = \u03c0^{-1}(int_Y cl_Y A). Surjectivity of \u03c0 implies the right side is empty iff int_Y cl_Y A is empty.\\n\\nProposition A4 (meagre equivalence for sets with the Baire property). Suppose A\u2286Y has the Baire property. Then A is meagre in Y iff \u03c0^{-1}(A) is meagre in X.\\nProof. \u201c\u21d2\u201d is immediate by A3 and countable unions. For \u201c\u21d0\u201d: if \u03c0^{-1}(A) is meagre but A is non\u2011meagre, then some nonempty open V\u2282Y has A comeagre in V. Thus V\u2216A is meagre, hence \u03c0^{-1}(V\u2216A) meagre by A3. But \u03c0^{-1}(V) is nonempty open in X, so \u03c0^{-1}(A) is comeagre in \u03c0^{-1}(V), contradicting meagreness of \u03c0^{-1}(A) in the Baire space X.\\n\\nCorollary A5 (Conjecture 1). For any unrooted property P and S_P=\u03c0^{-1}(T_P), smallness is root\u2011invariant: S_P nowhere dense (resp. meagre for Baire\u2011property P) in X iff T_P nowhere dense (resp. meagre) in Y. A root\u2011free cylinder criterion follows: for saturated S\u2282X, S is nowhere dense iff \u2200 unrooted balls B \u2203 refinement B\u2032 with Cyl(B\u2032)\u2282Cyl(B)\\\\S.\\n\\nB. No\u2011go for ball\u2011local topologies (Conjecture 2)\\n\\nDefinition B1. A topology \u03c4 on X is ball\u2011local if {\\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^F} is a base.\\n\\nTheorem B2. In any ball\u2011local topology on X, Theorems 14\u201317 (bridgeless nowhere dense; cut\u2011vertex nowhere dense; 2\u2011way infinite bridges meagre; \u03c7\u2032=D nowhere dense) remain valid. In particular, bridgeless graphs cannot be typical in any ball\u2011local topology.\\nProof. Each proof proceeds by rooted cylinder refinements that enforce a local obstruction in every extension of a refined ball F\u2032. Such refinements depend only on the extension poset of finite rooted balls, not on metric numerics. Hence the same arguments show nowhere denseness/meagreness in any topology with the same cylinder base.\\n\\nC. Odd D regular: a compact parity gadget\\n\\nDefine S(F)=\u2211_{v\u2208V(F)}(D\u2212deg_F(v)). In any D\u2011regular completion H\u2287F, |\u03b4_H(V(F))|=S(F).\\n\\nProposition C1 (S(F\u2032)=1 forcing). Let D be odd \u22653 and F a rooted r\u2011ball that occurs in a D\u2011regular graph. There exists an r\u2032 and a rooted refinement F\u2032 with max degree \u2264D and S(F\u2032)=1. Consequently, any D\u2011regular extension of F\u2032 contains a 1\u2011way infinite bridge.\\nProof. Let L be the boundary of F, c=\u2211_{v\u2208L}(D\u2212deg_F(v))=S(F). Add a new layer W of t vertices at distance r+1, and connect each v\u2208L to D\u2212deg_F(v) distinct vertices in W (total c edges). Add e_W edges inside W so that e_W=(D t\u2212c\u22121)/2 (choose t\u2265c with t\u2261c+1 mod 2; D odd ensures integrality). This yields S(F\u2032)=D t\u2212(c+2 e_W)=1. Degree bounds at W are respected by choosing t large and building the needed e_W\u2011edge simple graph on W. Then every D\u2011regular completion has exactly one edge leaving V(F\u2032), which is a bridge; the outside component is infinite, hence 1\u2011way infinite.\\n\\nD. Even D regular: a cut\u2011vertex forcing gadget\\n\\nProposition D1 (cut vertex forcing for even D). Let D be even, D\u22654. For any rooted r\u2011ball F that occurs in some D\u2011regular graph, there exists an r\u2032 and a rooted refinement F\u2032 with max degree \u2264D and a vertex u\u2208V(F\u2032) such that: (i) deg_{F\u2032}(u)=D\u22122 and every other vertex of F\u2032 has degree D; (ii) F\u2032\u2212u has exactly two connected components A,B; (iii) there are no edges between A and B in F\u2032. Consequently, in any D\u2011regular completion H\u2287F\u2032, all edges leaving V(F\u2032) are incident to u, and u is a cut vertex of H.\\n\\nProof. Pick any connected D\u2011regular graph R on D+2 vertices obtained as K_{D+2} minus a perfect matching (exists and is connected). It admits further perfect matchings (since K_{D+2} has a 1\u2011factorization; removing one perfect matching leaves a union of the remaining 1\u2011factors). Take two disjoint copies R_A,R_B. Let k=D\u22122 (even). Choose nonempty disjoint sets V_A\u2282V(R_A), V_B\u2282V(R_B) with |V_A|+|V_B|=k. For each x\u2208V_A\u222aV_B, delete one incident edge x y_x such that the deleted edges are pairwise disjoint (possible by abundance of matchings in dense R_\u22c5). Collect the freed endpoints W={y_x}. Pair up W inside each copy and add an edge between each pair within that copy (avoiding parallel edges). This restores all degrees in R_A\u222aR_B to D except at x which are now D\u22121; add a new vertex u and connect u to each x\u2208V_A\u222aV_B. Then deg(u)=k=D\u22122 and all other vertices have degree D. The resulting graph F* is connected and F*\u2212u has exactly two connected components R_A and R_B. Now let F\u2032 be the (r\u2032)-ball refinement obtained by grafting F* far outside the original boundary L of F and saturating all vertices within distance \u2264 r\u2032 from the root so that F\u2032 contains F and F*. Because all vertices except u have degree D in F\u2032, any D\u2011regular extension H of F\u2032 must add exactly two new edges (since S(F\u2032)=2), both incident to u. No edge can join A and B outside F\u2032 (their vertices are saturated inside F\u2032). Thus removing u disconnects H into (at least) the outside part and the two components containing R_A and R_B, so u is a cut vertex. Degree bounds and simplicity are maintained by the local rewiring and by adding u. (A standard choice is to work inside K_{D+2} minus one 1\u2011factor to ensure plentiful matchings; removing a small matching and re\u2011adding a matching preserves connectivity.)\\n\\nE. Robustness of Theorem 16 in ball\u2011local topologies\\n\\nLet T_{2wb} be the set of rooted graphs in X that contain a 2\u2011way infinite bridge.\\n\\nProposition E1 (meagre). For each k\u2208\\\\mathbb{N}, the set A_k={ (G,\u03c1): there exists a 2\u2011way infinite bridge at graph distance \u2264k from \u03c1 } is nowhere dense in any ball\u2011local topology; hence T_{2wb}=\u22c3_k A_k is meagre.\\nProof. Fix a rooted r\u2011ball F and k. Enlarge r if needed so that all edges at distance \u2264k from the root lie strictly within B_{r\u22121}(F). Construct a refinement F\u2032 by locally adding short cycles (triangles/squares or parity gadgets respecting degree constraints) around each edge within distance \u2264k so that in any extension each such edge lies on a cycle contained within distance \u2264 r from the root. This is possible by attaching bounded\u2011size 2\u2011edge\u2011connected gadgets to the endpoints while keeping max degree \u2264D (in =D, use parity gadgets to balance degrees, as in C1). Then every extension of F\u2032 has no bridge at distance \u2264k. Therefore \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^{F\u2032}\u2282\\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^{F}\\\\A_k, proving A_k is nowhere dense.\\n\\nProposition E2 (dense). T_{2wb} is dense in any ball\u2011local topology on X.\\nProof. Given any cylinder \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^F, construct a graph G by extending a copy of F outside its boundary by attaching two disjoint infinite bounded\u2011degree connected graphs S_1,S_2 (e.g., two infinite ladders) and then adding a single edge e between S_1 and S_2. Ensure all attachments occur beyond distance r+1 so B_r equals F. The edge e is a 2\u2011way infinite bridge in G. Hence \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\bullet^F meets T_{2wb}, proving density.\\n\\nThus Theorem 16 (meagre but not nowhere dense) persists across all ball\u2011local topologies.\\n\\nF. Re\u2011rooting\u2013insensitive pseudometric d_any: further density\\n\\nDefine on X the symmetric pseudometric\\n\u03b4(x,y)=2^{\u2212sup{ r: \u2203\u03c3 B_r(x)\u2245B_r(y,\u03c3) }} and d_any(x,y)=max{\u03b4(x,y),\u03b4(y,x)}.\\nTwo graphs are close if each contains a large rooted ball occurring somewhere in the other.\\n\\nLemma F1 (1\u2011way infinite bridges dense in \u2264D). For any x=(G,\u03c1) and r, there exists H with a 1\u2011way infinite bridge and \u03c3\u2208V(H) such that B_r(H,\u03c3)\u2245B_r(G,\u03c1) and d_any(x,(H,\u03c3))\u22642^{\u2212r}.\\nProof. As previously shown: attach an infinite pendant ray outside the r\u2011ball at a boundary vertex with available degree and complete the rest at distance \u2265 r+1.\\n\\nLemma F2 (bridgeless dense in \u2264D). For any x and r, there exists bridgeless H and \u03c3 with the same r\u2011ball and d_any\u22642^{\u2212r} (attach the r\u2011ball to a 2\u2011edge\u2011connected infinite scaffold and route boundary edges into cycles; see earlier E2\u2011type construction).\\n\\nLemma F3 (2\u2011way infinite bridges dense in \u2264D). For any x and r, there exists H with a 2\u2011way infinite bridge and \u03c3 with B_r(H,\u03c3)\u2245B_r(G,\u03c1), hence d_any\u22642^{\u2212r}.\\nProof. Let F=B_r(G,\u03c1). Outside the copy of F, attach two disjoint infinite bounded\u2011degree connected graphs S_1,S_2 and connect them by a single edge e. If some boundary vertex v in F has degree < D, join v by a path of length \u22652 to S_1 to ensure H is connected while keeping degrees \u2264D (if none, add a new tree beyond distance r+1 and connect appropriately to respect bounds). Then e is a 2\u2011way infinite bridge. Since attachments are beyond distance r, the r\u2011ball remains F at \u03c3.\\n\\nConsequences for Conjecture 2. Under d_any on \u2264D, all three classes\u2014bridgeless, 1\u2011way, and 2\u2011way infinite bridge graphs\u2014are dense. Determining typicality requires understanding whether the d_any\u2011quotient is Baire; if it is Baire, none of these dense sets can be comeagre simultaneously. Establishing (non\u2011)Baireness of the d_any topology is the next critical step.\\n\\nObstacles\\n\\n- Even D cut\u2011vertex gadget (D1): while the local rewiring scheme is standard in regular graphs (using matchings in dense graphs), one must ensure the chosen deleted edges form a matching and connectivity of each component R_A,R_B is preserved. Working inside K_{D+2} minus one perfect matching ensures abundant matchings; removing a tiny matching and re\u2011adding a matching preserves connectivity in such dense graphs.\\n- For E1 (meagreness of near\u2011root 2\u2011way bridges), ensuring degree constraints in =D requires parity gadgets akin to C1 to avoid exceeding D; the argument is local and uniform but should be written with an explicit small 2\u2011edge\u2011connected gadget for each D.\\n- For d_any, Baire/Polish status remains open; we avoid any claims here.\\n\\nNext steps\\n\\n- Write full proofs of A3\u2013A4 into proofs.md, settling Conjecture 1 for natural (Borel/analytic) properties.\\n- Expand C1 and D1 into detailed constructions with explicit small gadgets (e.g., instantiate R_A,R_B as K_{D+2} minus a fixed perfect matching; spell out the matching deletions and reconnections; verify connectivity rigorously).\\n- For E1, fix explicit 2\u2011edge\u2011connected gadgets for each D (\u2264D and =D) to cycle\u2011protect all edges within a prescribed radius without violating degree bounds.\\n- Analyze the Baire property of (X/\u223c,d_any): characterize basic neighborhoods via finite bi\u2011directional occurrence constraints and attempt a completion procedure; alternatively, embed the image into the Cantor cube via pattern\u2011occurrence indicators and study the subspace topology.\\n- Optional: strengthen density by showing that 2\u2011vertex\u2011connected graphs are also dense under d_any (construct via attaching to a 3\u2011edge\u2011connected scaffold and ensuring two internally disjoint connections from the r\u2011ball boundary), further separating typical behaviors under d_any.\\n\"}",
